[00:08:16] <djQuery> trying to find a good jqeurt ui bug to fix
[00:14:17] <smango> I have an ordered list, and I want to insert a string as the new first list item, pushing the rest down. I've googled and found several solutions but none of htem seem to do the right thing
[00:18:27] <djQuery> smango, %(
[00:19:39] <djQuery> smango, $('#myOL').prePend($('<li>', {text: 'Me first'}));
[00:19:49] <djQuery> smango, ORRRR $(
[00:20:19] <smango> djQuery: that seems to insert it before the entire OL
[00:20:52] <djQuery> $('<li>', {text: 'Me First'}).prePendto('#myOL');
[00:21:12] <djQuery> ?prepend
[00:21:15] <bot-t> .prepend(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the beginning of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[00:22:48] <smango> oh wait, I'm an idiot for a few reasons, that's the right answer, thanks :D
[00:24:43] <djQuery> smango, no probs
[00:24:50] <djQuery> dang it dead on hear
[00:24:54] <djQuery> here
[00:25:11] <djQuery> would think all these nerds wouldnt be out on a sat nite
[00:26:00] <djQuery> datepicker always has so many bugs
[00:30:41] <Afflicto> Hey all. I'm trying to upload my jquery plugin to the plugin repository. It's not showing up.thanks in advance
[00:36:23] <Forbidd3n> I am using accordion and wrapped with a form. I want to validate the fields within each section when they click continue button within that section only. Is this possible?
[00:45:14] <jude> whats the diff  between bind and live
[00:45:15] <jude> ?
[00:56:01] <thomedy> i usualy use javascript to design something... what other stuff could i do with javascript...
[00:56:09] <thomedy> i dont even know cuz i do so much animating
[01:32:12] <Cahnory> hi !
[01:32:34] <Whiskey> body { max-width 600px; } <-- how do i apply that whit jQuery
[01:32:45] <Whiskey> i know how to use the css, but not how to apply it to body
[01:32:59] <Cahnory> css({maxWidth: '600px'})
[01:33:06] <Cahnory> css('max-width', '600px')
[01:33:08] <Whiskey> Jow do you know it comes for body tehn?
[01:33:42] <Cahnory> ah sorry, $('body').css({maxWidth: '600px'});
[01:33:44] <kaichanvong> $('body').css(selector, attr)
[01:34:05] <Cahnory> kaichanvong: you mean property/value ;)
[01:34:40] <kaichanvong> :P  same diff
[01:35:08] <kaichanvong> Whiskey: the different between x,y and {x:y, a:b}
[01:35:17] <Whiskey> yeh
[01:35:19] <Whiskey> tjx :)
[01:35:22] <kaichanvong> is that the first you can only set one thing at a time
[01:35:35] <Whiskey> i only set this once
[01:35:39] <kaichanvong> because you're passing an object as options
[01:35:44] <kaichanvong> or just args
[01:36:32] <Whiskey> well lets try it see what happens
[01:36:36] <Cahnory> kaichanvong: My previous message was only about the argument names ;) sorry if I write weird sentences, not my natural language ^^
[01:37:54] <kaichanvong> Cahnory: ahhh yeah you're right attribute isn't really definitive enough to use for the key, value pair ;)
[01:39:13] <Cahnory> Guys, I made a plugin simplifying the jquery plugin authoring. I am looking for an idea of plugin which could demonstrate the functionnalities. Like a plugin exemple for plugin boilerplate
[01:39:21] <Cahnory> Any idea ?
[01:43:17] <Whiskey> I can tell that this did not work, "$("body").css("max-width", "maxWidth");"
[01:43:20] <Whiskey> maxWidth, is a variable
[01:43:35] <Cahnory> ???
[01:43:50] <Cahnory> $('body').css('max-width', '600px');
[01:43:53] <Cahnory> or
[01:44:08] <Cahnory> $('body').css({maxWidth: '600px'});
[01:45:27] <Cahnory> normal css name or smallCamelCase if you use arguments,  smallCameCase only if you use an object
[01:45:38] <djQuery> $(document.body).css({maxWidth: '600px', maxHeight: '600px'})
[01:46:25] <Whiskey> naaa, this worked $("body").css({"max-width": maxWidth});
[01:46:52] <Cahnory> document.body will be faster (I guess) but it looks like if Whiskey has some troubble with selecting so I made it simple and generic ;)
[01:47:19] <angelazou> quick question how do I check if a checkbox is selected or not?
[01:47:33] <angelazou> currently my code is typeof isChecked != "undefined" && isChecked == "checked"
[01:47:39] <systemfault> angelazou: $(selector).prop('checked')
[01:47:40] <Cahnory> a checkbox is never selected but it could be checked ^^
[01:47:51] <djQuery> Cahnory, the point was showing 2 set
[01:47:53] <angelazou> where isCheck = $('input[type=checkbox]').attr("checked")
[01:47:54] <Cahnory> rather :checked nop ?$
[01:47:54] <systemfault> angelazou: it will return true or false..
[01:48:05] <angelazou> I tried true and false too
[01:48:11] <angelazou> with quotes
[01:48:18] <angelazou> but it didn't respond
[01:48:20] <systemfault> use prop for that… not attr.
[01:48:29] <Cahnory> angelazou: but it looks like something clearly explained in the doc…
[01:48:54] <Cahnory> from my memory : .is(':checked')
[01:49:02] <systemfault> That should also work.
[01:49:19] <angelazou> i tried that is(:checked as well)
[01:49:32] <Cahnory> paste your code
[01:49:40] <angelazou> one second please
[01:50:07] <Cahnory> but you must did a mistake somewhere : http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[01:50:45] <Whiskey> Cahnory: the value is wrong anyways did not work as i was hope it wuld do
[01:51:04] <angelazou> here you go http://jsbin.com/ivekum/1/
[01:51:21] <Cahnory> Whiskey: past your code on jsfiddle, it should work, you made a mistake somewhere else
[01:51:33] <Whiskey> Naa its my code
[01:51:36] <Whiskey> its not your fult
[01:52:02] <Cahnory> angelazou: which file/line ?
[01:52:17] <Whiskey> i have a class called, test, how do i get the width of content in that test?
[01:52:19] <angelazou> the code is in the javascript section
[01:52:22] <angelazou> the first line
[01:52:27] <angelazou> and the if block
[01:52:45] <systemfault> angelazou: I told you that .is or prop return a boolean..
[01:52:50] <djQuery> Cahnory, click on the edit button in the upper left corner
[01:52:54] <djQuery> right corner
[01:52:57] <systemfault> Why the hell does your if checks for a string?
[01:52:58] <Cahnory> angelazou: you forgot ":" before checked
[01:53:08] <Cahnory> pseudoclass
[01:53:59] <Cahnory> prop('checked') --> is(':checked')
[01:54:19] <systemfault> ....
[01:54:22] <Cahnory> angelazou: look for the jquery "if" method in the dock
[01:54:23] <systemfault> ….Same difference.
[01:54:35] <angelazou> well, I modified it http://jsbin.com/ivekum/2/edit
[01:54:40] <systemfault> The problem is the if checking for a string
[01:55:01] <angelazou> still doesn't work, if it did, the last line should dissappear, so should the select box
[01:55:11] <systemfault> Then learn basic javascript..
[01:55:15] <Cahnory> systemfault: yep, it will be true or false… I think it's desperates tries to get thing working ^^
[01:55:44] <angelazou> but when I spit out the value in console, it says checked rather than true
[01:55:45] <systemfault> angelazou: Remove that shit condition inside your if..
[01:55:54] <thomedy> i just came up with a great idea for a possible  code example for my interviw... but one thing.. how do i dynamically choose a which script to run based on clic for example.. <script id='one'>   <script id ='other'> click one or the other
[01:55:57] <systemfault> angelazou: replace it with if (isChecked) {
[01:56:18] <angelazou> see for yourself http://jsbin.com/ivekum/2/edit
[01:56:30] <djQuery> this works http://jsbin.com/ivekum/4/edit
[01:56:40] <systemfault> thomedy: Both are already run by the time you choose to click..
[01:57:19] <angelazou> djQuery, well, neither the selectbox or the last line disappeared...
[01:57:27] <thomedy> i have seen scripts done dynamicaly but ii dont remember how they were implemented...
[01:57:41] <angelazou> ahh...so I lack an event
[01:58:06] <thomedy> like a load event
[01:58:09] <systemfault> thomedy: You can simply create a script tag with javascript, set the src attribute and append it to the head
[01:58:19] <angelazou> it's a change event i think
[01:58:26] <Whiskey> var test=$(".InfoViewBox").width() not working
[01:58:31] <Cahnory> angelazou: also [type="checkbox"] (use double quote for attribute values)
[01:58:31] <thomedy> oh that might work... thank you
[01:59:18] <dblosevn> He's using an I'd the type
[01:59:20] <thomedy> i have never done this particular thing... hmmm... quick quesiton.. im trying to display creativity and efficience at the same time.. would it be more impressive to dynamically load scripts with your example or to remember the efficience of the matter and call seperate functions
[01:59:24] <thomedy> its a big job
[01:59:26] <thomedy> so i want it bad
[01:59:28] <dblosevn> Doesn't even matter
[01:59:32] <systemfault> thomedy: Good :D
[01:59:50] <thomedy> seriously huge systemfault ,
[01:59:51] <systemfault> thomedy: Another approach I never used would be to xhr it then eval() it :P
[01:59:51] <Cahnory> Anybody has a good idea of an example plugin illustrating a boilerplate ? (in this case it's not really a boilerplate but the needs are the same)
[01:59:52] <dblosevn> Damon tablet
[02:00:05] <thomedy> i got the specs on the salary today.. its 8k/month
[02:00:10] <systemfault> thomedy: I'm also looking for a job… my last manager fucked me.
[02:00:45] <angelazou> yep, I was right, I lacked an event, thanks all
[02:00:49] <systemfault> thomedy: Wow, it's impossible to get that salary where I live by simply being a developer.
[02:01:11] <Cahnory> systemfault: same here
[02:01:12] <thomedy> that sucks i also run a business and think constantly about how to create a positive environment for my independent contractors but most recently thinking of how to get my independent contractors to do their job at all
[02:01:24] <thomedy> where are you gys
[02:01:28] <thomedy> in the owrld
[02:01:28] <Cahnory> France
[02:01:33] <Cahnory> Marseille
[02:01:35] <systemfault> thomedy: Canada (Montreal)
[02:01:44] <systemfault> Cahnory: Bon matin!
[02:01:45] <thomedy> thats awesome.. i want to teach myself french but im SOOOO busy
[02:02:01] <thomedy> i was teaching myself and my kids french but seriously im so busy
[02:02:33] <thomedy> anyway... to the original quesiton..... creative application of dynamic script loading or efficient loading of functions based on click that will wipe the screen
[02:02:44] <Whiskey> No one?
[02:02:47] <Cahnory> thomedy: hehe the good thing with english is that if you have not the time to learn it, you'll be forced reading documentations and interesting news on the web :D
[02:03:09] <Cahnory> You don't become a pro but you can interact a little ^^
[02:03:19] <thomedy> my app im building just tonight is a slider that does all sorts of stuff change color and stuff validate text or click a diff button and load a doodle pad in the canvas object
[02:03:20] <thomedy> ?
[02:03:39] <thomedy> i have to do it in jquery  even though im more comfortable in javasccript pure...
[02:03:51] <Cahnory> Why ?
[02:03:56] <systemfault> thomedy: jquery is even easier..
[02:04:06] <thomedy> so i am going back to jquery tonight i even taught myself to write my own jquery plugins earlier tonight
[02:04:12] <angelazou> does the change event apply to select box?
[02:04:14] <thomedy> i already no kquery
[02:04:22] <thomedy> i just prefer javascript
[02:04:29] <Whiskey> Can´t be so hard to caluclate a width of a div
[02:04:30] <thomedy> with out the framework
[02:04:40] <thomedy> but now that i can write plugins i feel better
[02:04:41] <Whiskey> based on the content inside it
[02:05:01] <thomedy> im goign to write a plugin for 3js and use that plugin to do my video game im building for 3d modeling
[02:05:03] <thomedy> but that s later
[02:05:05] <Cahnory> thomedy: it's all about crossbrowser support and comfort. So if you remove comfort, you can keep jQuery just for "risky" points (like dom selection for exemple)à
[02:05:33] <Cahnory> thomedy: why calculate it ?
[02:05:52] <Cahnory> oops, was for Whiskey
[02:05:56] <thomedy> i dont have the time right now to discuss this and your valuable topics.. i dont mean to be rude all points are consider.ed thougthful to me.. i just have alot to do and im littl emore than half way thro9ugh right now
[02:05:59] <thomedy> and its 4am
[02:06:19] <thomedy> my c hildren will be up at 8 or so and i have to get this example directory to my hopeful employers
[02:06:35] <Cahnory> thomedy: no problem ;) 11am here
[02:06:58] <Whiskey> Cahnory: Cuz IE6 / IE7 won´t show it correct
[02:07:09] <thomedy> okay... im going to do that dynamic thing cuz that sounds awesome
[02:07:12] <Whiskey> so it need to set the width why all the other webbrowsers works fine as it use display: table
[02:07:27] <Cahnory> Whiskey: so the probleme is not js but css
[02:07:38] <Whiskey> well yeh you culd say that
[02:07:44] <Cahnory> ^^
[02:08:48] <Whiskey> But it shuld be quite easy to calculate how mutch width it wuld need
[02:08:54] <Cahnory> in a buggy way, it's like you have two different results in two different devices because you set different media query (exception that in a case you want it and in the other it's "but"… but you have to know it^^)
[02:09:25] <Cahnory> "bug" or lake of implementation or prehistoric browser
[02:10:04] <Cahnory> Sorry I don't have as vocabulary as I need to express what I have in mind in english
[02:10:10] <Whiskey> Cahnory: what do you mean
[02:12:06] <Cahnory> hard to explain and the solution depends on your script
[02:12:36] <kaichanvong> Whiskey: have you tried using innerWidth?
[02:12:55] <Whiskey> i fix a fiddle
[02:13:29] <Cahnory> Anybody has an idea for my "problem"
[02:14:27] <systemfault> Cahnory: You had a problem?
[02:15:23] <Cahnory> not a big ;) I made a plugin which, basically, simplify the creation of plugin. So it's like a plugin boilerplate but you don't need to copy/past code each time you make a new plugin.
[02:16:02] <Cahnory> My "problem" is to find a good exemple showing functionalities it adds by default
[02:16:22] <systemfault> Hmm, not sure I get you.
[02:16:44] <Cahnory> systemfault: cahnory.github.com/jQuery.easyPlug <-- the explaination
[02:16:58] <tintin> success: function(data) {
[02:17:08] <tintin> here data is a string of the original javascript array
[02:17:19] <tintin> how can i get that original javascript array from string
[02:17:22] <tintin> how can i convert?
[02:17:42] <Cahnory> I don't know the rules of this channel but… hello ;)
[02:18:09] <Cahnory> which kind of string it is ? we can see it ?
[02:18:40] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/ZZ63v/ <-- there is the fiddle
[02:20:56] <Cahnory> Don't have IE here :/
[02:22:11] <systemfault> Cahnory: I don't understand/Je comprends pas esti de calisse.
[02:22:35] <Cahnory> esti de calisse ?
[02:22:43] <Cahnory> qebec ^^
[02:23:32] <systemfault> Exact.
[02:24:09] <Cahnory> systemfault: did you made jquery plugin yet ?
[02:25:32] <systemfault> Cahnory: A few times.
[02:25:43] <systemfault> I never used easyplug though.
[02:25:52] <systemfault> I never heard of it before.
[02:26:01] <Cahnory> it came out friday :)
[02:27:02] <Cahnory> so you might now that when you write a plugin there is some code you have to rewrite again and again. Like the part maintening chainability, keeping track of instanciation, merge default and user options, calling methods,…
[02:27:25] <Cahnory> easyPlug made it for you, all you have to worry is the code of your plugin, not how it's linked to jQuery
[02:30:20] <Whiskey> You don´t have to Cahnory, its just use 100% Width in ie thats all
[02:30:28] <Whiskey> as it can´t use the display: table
[02:31:45] <Cahnory> Whiskey: so, what happened if you make you element display inline, get the width and then make it display table again ?
[02:33:10] <Whiskey> not sure, but it can´t use table
[02:33:12] <Whiskey> as it don´t exist
[02:34:07] <Whiskey> and inline also use 100%
[02:34:17] <Cahnory> ???
[02:34:32] <Cahnory> an inline element use only the space it need
[02:36:07] <Whiskey> well i got full width on it
[02:36:09] <Whiskey> try in the fiddle
[02:36:28] <Cahnory> maybe it the width it need :/
[02:36:42] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/ZZ63v/1/
[02:39:20] <djQuery> you were talking about a plugin creator http://jsfiddle.net/djquery/Cbu4E/
[02:40:29] <Cahnory> djQuery: It's more like a jquery boilerplate filler. Not the same as easyPlug
[02:40:54] <Cahnory> but it's a good idea too :)
[02:44:18] <Whiskey> Cahnory: No easy way to get the width of the content in of the infoViewBox on that fiddle?
[02:44:22] <djQuery> easyplug aint gonna right the code for you
[02:44:50] <Cahnory> easyPlug will construct your plugin object
[02:45:23] <Cahnory> just like $.easyPlug(init, options);
[02:47:15] <Cahnory> Whiskey: don't really know what you want but http://jsfiddle.net/ZZ63v/2/
[02:48:07] <Whiskey> Cahnory: look at http://jsfiddle.net/ZZ63v/3/ and http://jsfiddle.net/ZZ63v/2/
[02:48:13] <Whiskey> Those two will all show diffrent values right
[02:49:01] <Cahnory> body inline ?
[02:50:46] <Whiskey> no no no
[02:50:49] <Whiskey> i talk about the console.log
[02:50:55] <Whiskey> The all diffrent values
[02:51:26] <Cahnory> yes and it's normal
[02:53:47] <Whiskey> yeh
[02:53:54] <Whiskey> good then we make that clear
[03:01:01] <Whiskey> I don´t use same code ass fiddle Cahnory, but 798px is the width i will find
[03:01:13] <Whiskey> and then i want the other fiddle thats get 800px to find the same to get correct size
[03:01:15] <Whiskey> you get it?
[03:02:02] <Cahnory> I think no :/ sorry but chatting in english is not as easy as reading some articles or doc ;)
[03:02:18] <Whiskey> lol
[03:02:22] <Whiskey> lets make it easy
[03:02:39] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/ZZ63v/2/ <-- thats how it looks in IE6/7
[03:02:57] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/ZZ63v/3/ <-- Thats how it shuld look, only way to get that is if you set the correct width
[03:03:54] <Whiskey> You do get that right
[03:12:05] <Cahnory> Yes but you don't correct IE bug just by simulating them
[03:13:34] <Cahnory> and there are some strange css which could add… issues, sorry lack of vocabulary once again
[03:19:08] <thomedy> ok... i have my plug in, im trying to apply some latter options as in $(body).modifyDom('elem', {elem:'div'});
[03:19:20] <thomedy> how do i harness the second argument
[03:20:09] <thomedy> im sorry modifyDom('create', {elem: 'div'})
[03:20:25] <Cahnory> can we saw your plugin ?
[03:20:32] <Cahnory> it depend how you made it
[03:24:21] <thomedy> yeah its  reall y simple right now.. one sec ill pastebin it
[03:26:56] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/jKjHaMMD
[03:27:26] <thomedy> its really simple right now but i think its a quick fix of a non existent solution that will showcase alot
[03:28:09] <Cahnory> but it's what jquery already do or I missed something
[03:28:28] <thomedy> does jquery already do that... i read it didn't
[03:28:56] <Cahnory> $('<div></div>').appendTo('body') for exemple
[03:29:03] <thomedy> crap... well nm
[03:29:04] <Cahnory> not just a single way to do that
[03:29:15] <Cahnory> $('body').append('<div></div>')
[03:29:43] <thomedy> well thats an easy fix... however i would still benefit from learning this even though i can do it other ways
[03:29:57] <thomedy> so if you wouldnt mind please continuy
[03:29:59] <thomedy> continue
[03:30:43] <Cahnory> ok, so, a common trick to call method is to check if first arg is a string. If it is, you can assume that it is a method name and not an option
[03:31:15] <thomedy> please explain...
[03:31:16] <Cahnory> https://github.com/cahnory/jQuery.easyPlug/blob/master/js/jquery.easyPlug.js#L39
[03:31:24] <thomedy> oh kay.. i can read that one sec
[03:31:51] <Cahnory> it's a condensed of all good practice I found
[03:32:22] <Cahnory> And this part is one of the thing easyPlug do for you ;)
[03:34:00] <Cahnory> same code using easyPlug http://pastebin.com/FcVU2Pa0
[03:37:08] <thomedy> okay i think i got tripped up twice by the same thing
[03:40:30] <thomedy> question does that paste include your plugin it seems like it does...
[03:40:38] <thomedy> im getting tired so im missing stuff
[03:40:47] <vicary> is it right to ask questions of the form plugin here?
[03:41:48] <Cahnory> No it doesn't but you have to to get this code work. But I'm not encouraging you to use it or not. It's just to illustrate my way :)
[03:42:03] <thomedy> i feel like my problem is i dont quite get apply however what i have read is that i can use apply rather than call to call an argument as an array
[03:42:32] <thomedy> and im assuming that the second option in the () is the second argument imattempting
[03:42:48] <Cahnory> apply : pass all arguments in an array. call : pass arguments normally
[03:43:00] <thomedy> right thats what i read...
[03:43:13] <thomedy> function(arg){}
[03:43:15] <thomedy> sorry
[03:43:23] <Cahnory> apply "apply the array to the arguments list" (it's how I remember it)
[03:44:29] <thomedy> so from my example... it seems like opts would work but i think thatsw the error im getting
[03:45:19] <Cahnory> thomedy: the problem is that you are passing all the arguments
[03:45:26] <Cahnory> but the first is the method name
[03:45:44] <Cahnory> you have to remove it. Look at the code on github i sent
[03:45:49] <thomedy> okay thank... by the way this is very difficult while holding seeping child
[03:46:00] <thomedy> but no excuses im getting this
[03:46:19] <Cahnory> thomedy: maybe the best you can do is to sleep a little ;)
[03:46:33] <Cahnory> it's hard to stop sometimes but it's for the better
[03:46:36] <thomedy> im almost done i gotta gotta gotta get this done tonight
[03:46:54] <thomedy> i told them i will have it tonight and that m eans  before they get in
[03:47:22] <Cahnory> wait a second
[03:49:28] <Cahnory> return methods[method].apply( this, Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments, 1) );
[03:49:30] <Cahnory> try this
[03:59:39] <thomedy> okay im looking at that your prototyping the ARray object adding slice and calling slice with arguments  im not sure what the one is
[03:59:41] <thomedy> 1 us'
[03:59:43] <thomedy> is
[04:00:31] <Cahnory> I apply the array method slice to the arguments object. The 1 is the key of the first element in the returned array. So it basically removes the first element in the arguments object.
[04:00:45] <Cahnory> It remove the name of your method, 'create' here.
[04:01:03] <thomedy> okay so arguments is a key word
[04:01:10] <thomedy> thats cool
[04:01:38] <Cahnory> arguments is an object containing all passed arguments (like php func_get_args)
[04:02:01] <thomedy> yep that worked...
[04:02:25] <thomedy> im so much stronger than i was but my focus was design... and i still have so much to learn thank you very much
[04:02:32] <Cahnory> http://dochub.io/#css/arguments
[04:02:40] <thomedy> ill read that thank you\
[04:02:40] <Cahnory> http://dochub.io/#javascript/arguments
[04:03:58] <Cahnory> hope it helps ;)
[04:12:23] <thomedy> okay thank you.. its very simple and now that i realize its unnecessary but at least its impressive i would imagine my only goal was to write a jquery plugin ... i have a good one as a showcase thank you
[04:12:40] <thomedy> i can write a disclamer explaing that fact tha ti know its unnessary and only to show i can
[04:12:42] <thomedy> and i can now
[04:12:51] <thomedy> slice.call helped
[04:13:32] <Cahnory> you're welcome :) always a pleasure even if it's a bit harder in english
[04:22:57] <jaypitidi> how can I target every fourth element that is display block?
[04:23:10] <jaypitidi> or every nth element?
[04:23:33] <Cahnory> I don't think you can do that by selector only
[04:23:44] <jaypitidi> I've tried modulo and :nth and :eq and i'm not getting the right result
[04:23:54] <Cahnory> you have to select all elements, then iterate on them and check css property
[04:25:41] <jaypitidi> Cahnory can you give me an example?
[04:26:25] <shoky> jaypitidi the conclusion is you should find another way to do whatever it is you want , other than selecting all display:block elements
[04:26:39] <shoky> e.g. maybe use a shared class
[04:27:27] <jaypitidi> so if i get the length of the shared class how can i add a class to the fourth item
[04:28:18] <shoky> you don't need the length
[04:29:08] <Cahnory> jaypitidi: sorry I must go :/
[04:29:09] <jaypitidi> $('#works-container ul.reveal').filter(function(index){ return index % 3 == 0; }).addClass('last');
[04:29:11] <shoky> you can do it with nth-child
[04:29:28] <shoky> er sorry
[04:31:31] <shoky> well yea that works ;p
[04:31:33] <shoky> right?
[04:31:44] <shoky> (with the filter, not nth-child)
[04:32:07] <jaypitidi> nth:child will iterate over all of the elements regardless of visibility
[04:33:25] <jaypitidi> I don't know i've been at this all night
[04:37:06] <shoky> you can try the :visible  selector for general visibility
[04:52:37] <guy> I have a function that sats a lot of events on various containers, e.g. function () { $('li').on('click', []); $(document).on(keypress, []); /* etc */ }; (ie. this is bind interface), then I need a function that will unbind all the previously set interfaces.
[04:52:43] <guy> what is the best way to keep track of all the bindings to unset them later?
[04:52:50] <guy> and what about assigning a unique ID to every interface and then using namespace to set them all off?
[04:53:04] <shoky> guy: use an event namespace
[04:53:21] <guy> everyone aye?
[04:53:24] <shoky> $('li').on('click.mynamespace', ..);

[08:33:37] <jrockjiggz> $.trim($(':input').val())
[08:33:42] <jrockjiggz> ?trim

[08:42:24] <iaj> jrockjiggz: thanks mhh tried that one as an example but it didntw ork out
[08:44:45] <jrockjiggz> well. you'd have to use it in your context
[08:45:09] <iaj> basically all the input value fields should be checked and trimmed
[08:45:12] <jrockjiggz> you could $(':input').each( function(){ $.trim($(this).val()); });
[08:45:20] <iaj> input[type="text"]
[08:45:32] <iaj> ahhh thanks
[08:45:37] <jrockjiggz> actually
[08:45:48] <jrockjiggz> you could $(':input').each( function(){ $(this).val($.trim($(this).val())); });
[08:45:53] <jrockjiggz> that will set it
[08:45:58] <djQuery> $(':input').each(function(){ this.value = $.trim(this.value); });
[08:46:05] <jrockjiggz> ^^
[08:46:44] <iaj> thanks guys =)
[09:14:01] <nebmo> hi, how do you make the following validation SKIP if <input type="hidden" /> (http://pastebin.com/XGR0dSbv) ?
[09:15:40] <djQuery>  if(this.type === 'hidden'){return false;}
[09:15:54] <djQuery> nebmo, inside your map
[09:20:32] <nebmo> djQuery: hmm i put it but still said put the class "error" on the hidden field. (http://pastebin.com/g5jEn3UX)
[09:21:04] <djQuery> why is validation the most reinvinted wheel
[09:21:29] <nebmo> :p because i dont know what im doing lol
[09:27:13] <squares> Is anyone here?
[09:28:15] <djQuery>  nebmo http://pastebin.com/gs82x7QJ

[09:28:30] <squares> whew... good.
[09:32:56] <nebmo> nice one. after a long 17 hours got 2 more things to fix and then i should be complete! thank you. lets see how long it takes before I give in :D

[10:44:49] <delac> how to change style of dragged item on sortable?
[10:46:37] <svcghost> Hey guys. I have a form that can have a varying amount of type="text" <input>'s  .. They each have an ID with the naming convention quantity0, quantity1, quantity2, etc.
[10:46:49] <svcghost> How can I check to make sure all these textboxes contain only numbers
[10:47:08] <svcghost> It's a hard thing to search for online sorr
[10:48:32] <VictorCL2> hi why would this not work
[10:48:33] <VictorCL2>  $("#footer_bar ul.left + li").
[10:48:33] <Whirl3d_> svcghost, you could use the type=number html5 element or you could dovar valid= $("input").val()==parseInt($("input").val(),10) if they are integers or parseFloat if the decimals
[10:48:52] <VictorCL2> i want to select all li that are in the ul.left .. the thing that inside the li are other lists .but I want to select just the one in the first ul
[10:49:21] <Whirl3d_> Blaster, you need to capture the mousedown event and start a loop that is stopped when the mouseup event is fired.
[10:50:08] <djQuery> svcghost, well one of the easiest things to do is to make sure that they have <input type="number" />
[10:50:25] <Whirl3d_> Forbidd3n, you can select the tab element and set it's "disabled" property to "disabled" and it should keep it from registering mouse click events (in effect disabling it).
[10:50:34] <svcghost> I don't want to use HTML5
[10:50:42] <svcghost> It's not supported in some browsers.
[10:50:49] <djQuery> svcghost, errr yes it is
[10:51:02] <svcghost> and it looks different in different browser
[10:51:12] <B|aster> Whirl3d_:  How do I start a loop in one handler and end it in a different?
[10:51:20] <Whirl3d_> DJDan, what are your really trying to do? you might want to set the value in a hidden element....it depends on what you are trying to accomplish
[10:51:22] <B|aster> setTimeout and stopTimeout ?
[10:51:26] <djQuery> the default is to fall back to <input type="text" /> if the browser doesnt understand the typr you used
[10:51:54] <djQuery> 2nd thing to do is to use anyone of the plethora of validation plugins
[10:51:59] <djQuery> ?validation
[10:52:03] <bot-t> djQuery, Plugins/Validation - jQuery Wiki - This documentation is moving to a new home http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[10:52:16] <dark> Hello, I'm a bit confused, is there a way to use a $ (the dollar sign) with Sizzle only?  Also would $(..selector..).parent() be supported?
[10:52:23] <DJDan> Whirl3d_: if i load a xml page via ajax, how do i access it later on without reloading the page? is there a way or do i need to add it to the dom?
[10:52:48] <Woet> anyone recommends a particular jQuery infinite scroll with ajax plugin?
[10:53:43] <djQuery> 3rd thing if you are going to roll your own and dont want to use a validation plug and feel that you just have to reinvint the wheel for the billionth time
[10:53:47] <Whirl3d_> Blaster, like this: $("element").on({mousedown:function ( ){ var pressed=true; var counter=1; while (pressed) {counter++);},mouseup:function ( ){pressed=false;});
[10:54:30] <djQuery> give it something better than just the id to search by <input id="quantity3" class="numberonly" />
[10:54:40] <Whirl3d_> DJDan, your browser will cache the page, I believe, so loading it a second time takes little or no time.
[10:54:47] <B|aster> Whirl3d_: Cool thanks!
[10:55:22] <Whirl3d_> Blaster, I am infamous for getting my {(}) messed up, so double check it...that's the basic idea though.
[10:55:37] <B|aster> sure
[10:56:00] <B|aster> if you declare var inside the mousedown, wouldn't it be inaccessible from mouseup?
[10:56:12] <B|aster> wouldn't var pressed; have to come outside of those closures?
[10:56:20] <Whirl3d_> dark, lookup jquery noconflict, see if that doesn't help.
[10:56:40] <Whirl3d_> Blaster, try it both ways. I think it works because it is defined in the same scope, but I could be wrong.
[10:56:53] <B|aster> ok
[10:56:53] <djQuery> function(){ var x } would be inaccessible function(){ x = true} would be accessible
[10:57:04] <dark> Whirl3d_, will see, thanks. is this for the $ question or the ..parent() question?
[10:57:07] <djQuery> the 2nd example makes it a global var though
[10:57:21] <B|aster> djQuery: just by dropping the var, it becomes global?
[10:57:29] <djQuery> B|aster, yes
[10:57:33] <B|aster> interesting
[10:57:42] <B|aster> is that bad practice?  I know in PHP they say not to use global vars
[10:57:56] <djQuery> B|aster, but that can completly polute global
[10:58:03] <djQuery> var myVars = {};
[10:58:15] <dark> Whirl3d_, oh, that was to remove the $ from jquery, okay, but not exactly what I was looking for
[10:58:19] <djQuery> function(){   myVars.X = true; }
[10:58:32] <djQuery> this way you only truly have 1 global var
[10:58:37] <Whirl3d_> dark, could you explain more, please
[10:58:48] <B|aster> is that var myVars = {}; just to save time from writing a var statement for each variable?
[10:59:25] <djQuery> B|aster, no it is a container for all your different vars that you may create in the future
[10:59:51] <Whirl3d_> djQuery, how does that pollute less? Thanks for the insight, btw
[11:00:29] <Whirl3d_> The reason you don't use globally scoped variables is because of trash pickup, right. So how does a single globally scoped varialble help with that?
[11:00:33] <dark> I was looking at the documentation of sizzle https://github.com/jquery/sizzle/wiki/Sizzle-Documentation and the only example with $ is a custom-made one. (I want to move a code from jquery to sizzle). but anyway, perhaps var $ = Sizzle; would do it
[11:01:13] <Whirl3d_> dark, I think so, then you could do $$=JQuery;
[11:01:20] <Whirl3d_> or what have you
[11:01:32] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, true that you dont want to use globals unless u have to, but also what if you declare X and some plugin also declars a global x
[11:01:40] <djQuery> wouldn't that suck
[11:02:16] <Whirl3d_> Point taken. Thanks. I just think of globals as forbidden and never really discovered why...
[11:02:39] <djQuery> not forbidden but realy discouraged
[11:02:56] <Whirl3d_> Blaster, you could also store the variable in the elements data object....var counter=$(this).data("counter"); counter++ for example..
[11:02:57] <dark> Yeah got it. But.. what if I am using .children() and .parent() from jquery.. any way to have this with sizzle?
[11:03:41] <B|aster> Whirl3d_:  I am actually doing this to increment a text field value with up and down arrows
[11:03:44] <Whirl3d_> dark, it was my understanding that jquery was built on the sizzle engine, so I am not going to be much help.
[11:03:47] <B|aster> So the value would be stored there
[11:03:54] <Whirl3d_> perfect
[11:03:56] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, good point I wasn't completly up with convo
[11:03:57] <B|aster> I was just referring to the "pressed" variable
[11:04:08] <Whirl3d_> use a class
[11:04:51] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, it is
[11:05:18] <Whirl3d_> $("element").on({mousedown:function () {$(this).addClass("pressed"); while ($(this).is(".pressed")) {incrementField);}, mouseup:function () {$(this).removeClass("pressed");});
[11:06:08] <delac> how to change style of dragged item on sortable?
[11:06:11] <djQuery> B|aster, you would want to do its Whirl3d_ 's way when there is a chance that this var could be in refrence to several different elements and not an actual global value for the page\app
[11:06:33] <djQuery> ?sortable
[11:06:38] <bot-t> djQuery, UI/API/1.8/Sortable - jQuery Wiki - The jQuery UI Sortable plugin makes selected elements sortable by dragging with the mouse. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Sortable
[11:07:06] <Whirl3d_> and then you'd have to define function incrementField like function (fld) {var val=parseInt(fld.val()); val++; fld.val(val);}
[11:07:36] <delac> djQuery: yeah, been reading that. cant find what I need
[11:07:37] <Whirl3d_> *parseInt(fld.val(),10)   sry
[11:08:07] <Whirl3d_> delac, capture the mouseup event and apply the style
[11:08:08] <djQuery> delac, I just did that cause I was too lazy to open the browser my selft
[11:08:14] <dark> I don't qunderstand exactly, but it seems that sizzle is only the selector part, without the transversing capabilities of jquery.. it should be obvious, but I thought that transversing was part of the selector engine
[11:08:22] <djQuery> delac, going over it again myselft real quick
[11:08:31] <Whirl3d_> $("elem").on("mouseup", funcction () {$(this).addClass("something");});
[11:08:48] <djQuery> delac, but if worse comes to worse you could override the dragStart and dragEnd events
[11:09:00] <djQuery> just not sure exactly what they are called
[11:09:02] <Whirl3d_> dark, what are you really trying to do that you think jquery can't do
[11:10:34] <Whirl3d_> djQuery, you were the first person to help me in this channel and since then, I have really done my best to help people as I can and it has made all the difference. I wanted to thank you again for your generosity..
[11:10:38] <Whirl3d_> djQuery++
[11:10:49] <dark> Whirl3d_, I'm extracting data from a site with casperjs.. I am using jquery, but I don't need its full library
[11:11:04] <djQuery> delac, the event would be the start and end events
[11:11:19] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, ++
[11:11:59] <djQuery> dark, there are a couple projects out there to make it to where you can just grab pieces of jquery
[11:12:10] <djQuery> don't remember what they are called though
[11:12:26] <dark> djQuery, thanks, that's likely what I want :)
[11:12:52] <djQuery> think it is on the roadmap to do this natively in jquery later, have some kind of download builder
[11:13:46] <djQuery> delac, http://docs.jquery.com/UI/API/1.8/Sortable#event-start
[11:14:41] <djQuery> delac, dont know exactly what you are trying to do but check out all the events while you are there
[11:15:15] <djQuery> DJDan, rather keep it in here where everyone can learn
[11:15:27] <djQuery> thats how I fingered out half the stuff I know
[11:15:47] <djQuery> the rest was brute force beating head against code
[11:16:16] <Whirl3d_> Does anybody know of a "drag and drop" "style" project. I have some custom "text styles" that I want my client to use and I wan them to be able to drag a "styled text" element into a workspace to eventually create a WordPress post (in html)
[11:17:16] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, sounds cool, can see all sorts of issues implimenting it
[11:17:50] <delac> djQuery: yes, this seems to do the trick. thanks
[11:18:24] <djQuery> delac, I don't always remember the answer but remember where to look for it
[11:18:45] <djQuery> lol I don't have a memory only an index
[11:19:05] <thomedy> okay im just going to put myself out there...
[11:19:08] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[11:19:16] <thomedy> i just sent that list of examples to a possible job
[11:19:23] <thomedy> what do you guys think
[11:19:28] <Whirl3d_> I opened my mouth and put my foot into it and it's proving to be much more difficult than I thought .http://i.imgur.com/xFE62.png
[11:20:34] <djQuery> thomedy, realy your using alert on a resume site?
[11:21:53] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, whats so hard about it?
[11:22:13] <thomedy> just to give directions.. not for anything important
[11:22:29] <thomedy> its not like i use em anywhere else
[11:22:58] <Whirl3d_> Well the draggable/sortable thing for the styles is a mess. And because they REFUSE to have a consistent format, I have to make all of the elements on the WOD movable/removable...
[11:23:05] <djQuery> thomedy, just me giving you that reply though should alert you to what people will think
[11:23:24] <Whirl3d_> And sure as I setup a constraint of any sort, they write a stupid WOD to violate it. It's so frustrating.
[11:23:41] <thomedy> i noticed that but im surprised that you say that becuase its just a little before you get started know this kind of thing
[11:23:47] <thomedy> any way thank oyu
[11:24:17] <djQuery> thomedy, move it to some kinda header or something
[11:24:42] <thomedy> heres a real quesiton though... i have an image that loads in chrome buturl fails in firefox
[11:24:43] <thomedy> wtf
[11:24:59] <djQuery> lol, gotta love that
[11:25:00] <Whirl3d_> My newest thing that I would like to see ALL software introduce is an non-modal alert window that is cumulative....so if I get 5 errors or instructions, they show in a non-modal window.
[11:25:14] <djQuery> thomedy, and one of your examples didnt work for me
[11:25:19] <thomedy> which one
[11:25:22] <thomedy> was it a 3d one
[11:25:27] <djQuery> y
[11:25:40] <thomedy> you have to refresh those my email to the guy said that
[11:26:05] <djQuery> thomedy, think you would do a lot better with tutorials on how you did it rather than just examples of doing it
[11:26:08] <thomedy> but there is both heavy logic in the 3d one, and larg image file in the fake 3d one
[11:26:17] <Whirl3d_> thomedy, you should say: use your mousewheel to view the sprite, not scroll . I may not use my mouse wheel to scroll...I was trying to drag the page.
[11:26:18] <thomedy> what do you mean...
[11:26:32] <thomedy> thats the alert though
[11:26:36] <djQuery> proves that you truly know it and can comunicate it with team members etc.. and that you didnt just copy it from somewhere else
[11:26:49] <Whirl3d_> agreed.
[11:27:01] <thomedy> okay wait now im confused.. i think this may be helpful say it again please im sorry
[11:27:30] <djQuery> thomedy, these are supposed to be examples of your work for a resume right?
[11:27:33] <thomedy> right
[11:27:51] <thomedy> my alert wasn't explanatory enough?
[11:27:54] <djQuery> being able to do the work is a tiny fraction of working for some one
[11:28:20] <djQuery> being able to comunicate is actualy a larger part in most instances
[11:28:35] <thomedy> okay.. definately noticed... and your recommendation is?
[11:28:46] <djQuery> move the alert to a header
[11:28:59] <thomedy> like a div holding the info?
[11:29:04] <thomedy> on top
[11:29:06] <djQuery> yes
[11:29:18] <djQuery> example following directly after
[11:29:20] <thomedy> okay... hmmm... its weird to me that you really didn't like the alerts
[11:29:33] <thomedy> do you think they  need an example of use your mouse to scroll
[11:29:40] <djQuery> then a tutorial explaining how to do it after the example
[11:30:32] <thomedy> okay that seems like over kill but that makes sense to make it overkilll to ensure communication
[11:30:51] <thomedy> im not even sure how i would go about that right now
[11:30:52] <thomedy> but
[11:31:36] <Cypher27> jquery is life
[11:31:50] <djQuery> hang out in irc's that discuss the type of stuff you want to do for a living
[11:32:01] <djQuery> when you see something intresting come up help them
[11:32:11] <thomedy> are you talking to  me?
[11:32:13] <djQuery> the write a blog post about it basicaly
[11:32:19] <djQuery> thomedy, yes
[11:32:26] <thomedy> oh im sory... im trying to figure out that url thing
[11:32:47] <djQuery> didnt see that Q
[11:32:47] <thomedy> ... im so excited though i havent slept yet... because i promised results and i had to make sure it got there fast
[11:33:10] <DJDan> i have drag and drop for questions&answers collection.... i want to reset the questions back to its original position.... is there a way to restore previous position? or should i just remove all the divs and start again?
[11:33:23] <thomedy> i taught myslef to write a jquery plug in for htis
[11:33:34] <thomedy> wait did you like the sites at all
[11:33:43] <thomedy> i was pretty proud of myself..
[11:33:44] <djQuery> thomedy, now move on to writing a jquery ui plugin
[11:33:50] <djQuery> I like those better myself
[11:34:01] <djQuery> was the link again
[11:34:01] <thomedy> what is a ui plugin as aposed to a jquery plugin
[11:34:04] <Whirl3d_> DJDan when you first position your elements (before the drag and drop orgy), store the postion() of each element in it's data object
[11:34:11] <thomedy> www.thesartorer.com
[11:34:15] <Whirl3d_> jqueryUI
[11:34:21] <djQuery> ?widgetfactory @thomedy
[11:34:21] <bot-t> thomedy, http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/tips-for-developing-jquery-ui-widgets/
[11:34:24] <Whirl3d_> widgetized plugins
[11:34:42] <thomedy> i  want to write a plug in for 3js
[11:34:56] <thomedy> that seems globaly usefull
[11:35:16] <Whirl3d_> DJDan, then to reset them, cycle through them and lookup their original positions in their data objecs... piece o cake
[11:35:17] <djQuery> the band?
[11:36:35] <thomedy> quick question... what does it mean to consult
[11:36:48] <thomedy> i have talked to a number of consultants and i dont know  what they do at all
[11:36:54] <thomedy> for the web of course
[11:37:46] <Whirl3d_> what we are doing now...just for the end customer
[11:38:08] <thomedy> okay.. so no actual code just saying you can do this to fix it or maybe try this kinda stuff
[11:38:09] <thomedy> cool
[11:38:10] <Whirl3d_> give advice and input, feedback, direction. Hopefully impart some wisdom or style to the client...
[11:38:30] <Whirl3d_> But usually I end up doing the work as well. just FYI
[11:39:45] <smartidiot> Anyone know where to find simple, lightweight, share buttons in javascript?
[11:39:49] <thomedy> well i have been up since yesterday so im tired. and im going to go clean my house before i have to go tow ork
[11:39:58] <thomedy> thank you all and to all a good night
[11:40:05] <smartidiot> good night
[11:42:39] <smartidiot> Seems like all the jquery social buttons are bloated conundrums of javashit
[11:43:48] <Whirl3d_> That's always a good way to join a channel.
[11:44:05] <Whirl3d_> try #javascript   insult them first, though
[11:44:30] <Whirl3d_> gnite thomedy
[11:45:02] <smartidiot> Sorry if I offended anyone. Wasn't my intention.
[11:45:37] <Whirl3d_> I figured as much. I was just ribbing ya.
[11:45:48] <smartidiot> Damn, got me.
[11:45:55] <Whirl3d_> ;)
[11:48:03] <serard> hello
[11:48:07] <serard> someone here using jsTree ?
[11:49:36] <smartidiot> Don't you hate it when the wifey is moaning while you're trying to get some work done? Worst feeling ever.
[11:49:57] <smartidiot> I'm about to strangle a witch.
[11:50:07] <Whirl3d_> I avoid that by avoiding having a "wifey"
[11:50:22] <Whirl3d_> I suppose ya got kids, too...
[11:50:26] <smartidiot> How lucky
[11:50:40] <smartidiot> Worst goddam decision of my existence
[11:50:54] <Whirl3d_> Sorry to hear that.
[11:51:07] <smartidiot> I'm coping.
[11:51:48] <smartidiot> Now if only I can find this damn jquery plugiin
[12:02:03] <Whirl3d_> is there a way to capture the position of the mouse without a mouseevent?
[12:02:32] <djQuery> smartidiot, well that realy  depends
[12:03:17] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, err not realy
[12:04:29] <smartidiot> djQuery: Any suggestions?
[12:06:25] <djQuery> smartidiot, dont come to me for relationship advice
[12:07:43] <smartidiot> djQuery: I'm talking about a social share button
[12:08:52] <djQuery> smartidiot, I am not very sociable
[12:09:07] <djQuery> sorry just no experience with any of those
[12:09:15] <smartidiot> djQuery: My ass you aren't
[12:09:32] <smartidiot> I know a troll when I hear one.
[12:09:50] <dcope> Hey all, how can i get this to work if the title contians a '? titleElement.append("<input class='title-text' type='text' value='" + title + "'></input>")
[12:10:35] <smartidiot> Just looking for any button other then a jumblescripted mass of browser blowage
[12:12:01] <smartidiot> dammit brb, the wifey's calling
[12:12:33] <amccloud> What's the best way to do $input.parent().parent().find('label')? I tried $.closest but I don't think that's what i'm looking for.
[12:14:00] <Whirl3d_> amccloud, you could do $("label").filter(function () {return $(this).attr("for")==fld.attr("name")?fld:null;});
[12:14:24] <lundy> Good Evening, im just wondering if there is a way to run a jquery script to check and see if my computer is connected to a website or even more if I am connected to the internet. I have used Navigator.online but this fails because my internet cuts off at the router
[12:14:36] <Whirl3d_> basically, find all labels and filter for the labels by their "for" attribute
[12:14:38] <lundy> and navigator.online still things im online
[12:15:12] <B|aster> Whirl3d_:  I tried that method you gave me earlier and it's freezing my browser
[12:15:16] <B|aster> I'll pastebin my code
[12:15:29] <Whirl3d_> That's probably the while...I hate while...
[12:15:49] <B|aster> http://pastebin.com/WTYVC3hj
[12:16:00] <Whirl3d_> Blaster, looking now...
[12:16:05] <B|aster> thanks
[12:16:05] <djQuery> ?demo@b|aster
[12:16:05] <bot-t> b|aster, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:16:17] <B|aster> I'll create a demo
[12:16:17] <amccloud> Whirl3d_: Thanks, but that wouldn't work when someone does <label><input/></label>
[12:16:56] <djQuery> amccloud, then throw in a test to see wht the direct parent of the input is
[12:17:18] <Whirl3d_> I love jsfiddle....
[12:17:27] <djQuery> jsbin for the win
[12:17:58] <Whirl3d_> better than jsfiddle?
[12:18:06] <djQuery> in my opinion
[12:18:08] <lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/zBUSU/ this just give me a error :( am I doing something wrong
[12:18:45] <Whirl3d_> No preloading libraries?
[12:19:04] <lundy> Whirl3d_ ??
[12:19:16] <Whirl3d_> I just get aw, snap! when I try to load a library.
[12:19:26] <Whirl3d_> lundy, sorry that was for djQuery
[12:19:51] <lundy> kk
[12:21:05] <lundy> I cant seem to work out wot im doing wrong :(
[12:22:54] <B|aster> Guys, here is my demo: http://jsfiddle.net/HzVXP/
[12:23:15] <B|aster> beware it might freeze your browser!   I just want holding up or down arrow inside the input to increment or decrement it constantly
[12:24:02] <B|aster> See here is a fork without the while, and it does it properly, but you have to keep clicking up or down.  I want to just be able to hold the keys down http://jsfiddle.net/wktRk/
[12:24:38] <B|aster> wait... for some reason the fork works properly..
[12:24:42] <B|aster> the way I want it
[12:24:58] <lundy> :/
[12:25:10] <lundy> anyone able to have a look at my problem?
[12:25:34] <lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/zBUSU/
[12:25:45] <lundy> for some reason I keep getting 404
[12:31:32] <Segaja> lundy: have a look in the firebug console. you get an 200 OK from the server but no result sent
[12:31:49] <Segaja> there might be some header in the response block that could tell you what your problem ist
[12:36:23] <lundy> Segaja: here is wot i get from the headers
[12:36:24] <lundy> http://nopaste.info/e4f6f9bfce.html
[12:36:56] <Segaja> lundy: did you try another side to test this?
[12:38:12] <lundy> im just uploading a test page to my server to see if I can get a response from it
[12:40:08] <lundy> Segaja: http://nopaste.info/ff9c166b5a.html
[12:40:22] <lundy> as you can see im trying to get it from www.lundy.me.uk/true.php
[12:42:24] <lundy> :/
[12:44:56] <shoky> lundy:  if i understood your question correctly.. it's because you're loading from a different domain
[12:45:00] <shoky> ?sop
[12:45:00] <bot-t> Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Same_origin_policy_for_JavaScript
[12:47:21] <lundy> wot ill try and do is explain wot im trying to do.... At the moment in my work im loading up a internet radio to stream music into the shop. But out internet keeps cutting out for some reason... so I have to run up a flight of stairs to the computer and click refresh on the page.
[12:47:44] <lundy> Im trying to build a script which checks for internet connection and if it drops then refresh the page until it comes back
[12:48:19] <Whirl3d_> Blaster, I am m issing something. but this might be close...I need to stop the keypress event from happening. still working on it.
[12:48:25] <lundy> so my idea was to try and load some content from a webpage online and keep checking it ........ if it errors then refresh
[12:48:31] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/HzVXP/3/
[12:59:58] <djQuery> Whirl3d_, need to add another parameter for the incirment amount
[13:00:45] <Whirl3d_> Actually, I forgot to say !inp.is("input")   so it was returning  immediately.
[13:01:43] <djQuery> lol see that now
[13:02:10] <gaprl> WoW
[13:02:17] <Whirl3d_> Still it's not registering my mouseup
[13:03:08] <Whirl3d_> or keyup rather
[13:03:53] <Whirl3d_> and I'm getting a object has no replace method? Huh?
[13:04:03] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/HzVXP/5/
[13:05:24] <Whirl3d_> duh, got it...
[13:11:30] <Whirl3d_> It's like it's unbinding my keydown event?
[13:14:24] <shoky> Whirl3d_: you're adding the incrementing class up front.. and you only bind keyup/mouseup if there is no incrementing class
[13:17:46] <Whirl3d_> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/HzVXP/7/
[13:17:56] <Whirl3d_> changed that just a minute ago, I thought.
[13:19:07] <shoky> removeData('timer')  yes?
[13:19:49] <Whirl3d_> only when starting the increment
[13:20:01] <Whirl3d_> cause going up then down was throwing an error
[13:20:18] <Whirl3d_> I declare the local timer variable right after (for the second time)
[13:20:35] <shoky> i mean..  removeData('timer')  instead of removeData(timer)
[13:20:38] <garbagecollectio> why does document ready
[13:20:50] <Whirl3d_> you rock
[13:20:51] <Eviltwin> I'm not loving the pollution of the $.fn space
[13:22:10] <Whirl3d_> lol I know. I was really experimenting with it cause I am going to be using it a lot. I should make an incremental class and pollute it.
[13:22:14] <garbagecollectio> why in jquery do you have to put document.ready
[13:22:20] <garbagecollectio> like why the document part
[13:22:30] <Eviltwin> Do you know what the load event is?
[13:22:33] <garbagecollectio> i do
[13:22:35] <Eviltwin> The window.load event
[13:22:37] <garbagecollectio> but I'm wondering why document has to be in there
[13:22:49] <garbagecollectio> thats not what its measuring, its measuring DOMCONtentLoaded a js property
[13:22:50] <Eviltwin> When window.load fires what does that mean?
[13:23:13] <garbagecollectio> it means the window is loaded not necessarily the DOm
[13:23:25] <Eviltwin> Actually window.load always comes after the DOM
[13:23:39] <Eviltwin> It means the DOM is all there and every image etc that was in it has loaded
[13:23:56] <Eviltwin> DOMContentLoaded means that the complete DOM is there but the images may not have loaded yet
[13:23:57] <garbagecollectio> no
[13:24:06] <Eviltwin> And it is a property of the document
[13:24:24] <garbagecollectio> first off
[13:24:28] <garbagecollectio> do you mean window.onload?
[13:25:12] <Eviltwin> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla_event_reference/DOMContentLoaded_(event)
[13:25:20] <Eviltwin> "The DOMContentLoaded event is fired when the document has been completely loaded and parsed, without waiting for stylesheets, images, and subframes to finish loading (the load event can be used to detect a fully-loaded page)."
[13:25:22] <garbagecollectio> actually your right
[13:25:27] <garbagecollectio> my apologies
[13:25:28] <Eviltwin> I know I am, thanks
[13:25:52] <Eviltwin> Sorry, that was rude
[13:26:04] <Eviltwin> I don't like it when people question my knowledge
[13:26:33] <Whirl3d_> which is odd, because you are almost always right, so why let it bug ya?
[13:26:49] <Whirl3d_> And I say "almost" to be polite, really.
[13:27:13] <Eviltwin> Mostly because someone in here may get incorrect information
[13:27:21] <Whirl3d_> I admire that.
[13:27:29] <garbagecollectio> i guess I'm wondering why the document has to be wrapped
[13:27:36] <garbagecollectio> $(document).ready
[13:27:48] <garbagecollectio> oh i see its executing a function and calling a callback, ready
[13:27:48] <Eviltwin> There's no "ready" property of the document
[13:28:05] <Eviltwin> Yes, it's a syntax for attaching an event listener
[13:28:09] <Eviltwin> A shorthand
[13:28:16] <garbagecollectio> its passing in document and waiting for document to load and then executing a callback in ready
[13:28:27] <Eviltwin> For something like document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() { ... })
[13:28:43] <garbagecollectio> so how come you can do it with out the document there
[13:28:46] <garbagecollectio> it can not take that argument
[13:28:51] <garbagecollectio> it can just take a function to execute
[13:29:06] <Eviltwin> What do you mean without the document there?
[13:29:15] <Whirl3d_> How could I change my increment methods into an incremental class where only "iniitalized" elements have access to certain methods?
[13:29:53] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: It's probably best to use the standard plugin style
[13:30:04] <Eviltwin> $(foo).myClass("methodName", arg1, arg2) ...
[13:30:05] <garbagecollectio> Eviltwin: I mean the alternative document ready synax
[13:30:16] <garbagecollectio> $(function() { })
[13:30:33] <Eviltwin> That's an alias for $(document).ready(function() { ... })
[13:30:38] <Eviltwin> Because people don't like typing things
[13:30:51] <garbagecollectio> i mean thats not an alias
[13:30:58] <garbagecollectio> i mean it's not like an aslias
[13:31:04] <garbagecollectio> you are passing in document
[13:31:07] <Eviltwin> Inside the jQuery funciton, it's recognizing that you passed in a function
[13:31:15] <garbagecollectio> in one and the other they are actually executing a callback
[13:31:17] <garbagecollectio> ok
[13:31:20] <Eviltwin> And it calling $(document).ready(thing you passed in)
[13:31:27] <Eviltwin> is calling*
[13:31:30] <garbagecollectio> so it checks if its document passing initially or a function
[13:31:31] <garbagecollectio> ?
[13:31:45] <Eviltwin> The $(...) does a lot of things
[13:31:54] <Eviltwin> See here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/
[13:32:48] <Eviltwin> It does different things depending on the type of what's passed in
[13:32:53] <garbagecollectio> yeah how the hell can it do all that
[13:32:59] <garbagecollectio> it checks every case?
[13:33:17] <Eviltwin> There's some abstraction but effectively yes
[13:33:23] <Eviltwin> It uses a lot of type checking to determine what to do
[13:33:30] <garbagecollectio> do you know why you can both use jQuery and $ how did they make those synonmous?
[13:33:57] <Eviltwin> They set window.jQuery and window.$ to the same function
[13:34:13] <Eviltwin> The one that does all this magic
[13:34:46] <garbagecollectio> how do they do that
[13:35:22] <Whirl3d_> When writing a plugin that uses $.extend() to extend the default object, is that a good idea because the passed object may have more options than defined in the plugin...shouldn't you restrict the options to those defined?
[13:35:38] <Whirl3d_> *default settings object. sorry
[13:36:47] <Eviltwin> garbagecollectio: It's a lot of pretty advanced JavaScript
[13:36:51] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ garbagecollectio
[13:36:52] <bot-t> garbagecollectio, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[13:37:02] <garbagecollectio> i know jvacript
[13:37:08] <Eviltwin> Okay
[13:37:11] <Eviltwin> ?hard @ garbagecollectio
[13:37:12] <bot-t> garbagecollectio, var z = "foo"; function x(y) { return this[y](z); } var w = x.apply(document, ["getElementById"]);
[13:37:14] <Eviltwin> What does this do?
[13:37:25] <Eviltwin> If you were to run it on a page
[13:37:30] <Es0teric> how do you listen for a keyup event and a click event for the same element? (such as pressing enter on a input field or clicking submit to do the same thing)
[13:37:35] <Forbidd3n> anyone know of a good accordion validation script that uses rules, I already tried - http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/multipart/ - doesn't allow rules
[13:38:17] <Forbidd3n> for multiple steps
[13:38:22] <Forbidd3n> within one form
[13:38:54] <Eviltwin> garbagecollectio: If you can't tell me what that's doing reasonably fast then while you may know some of JavaScript you definitely don't know all of JavaScript
[13:39:23] <garbagecollectio> no thats not true
[13:39:26] <garbagecollectio> this is a puzzle question
[13:39:31] <garbagecollectio> not js knowledge question
[13:39:35] <garbagecollectio> theres a lot going on
[13:39:37] <Eviltwin> It's using only JavaScript syntax
[13:39:53] <shoky> it's a pretty simple question if you _know_ javascript
[13:39:57] <Eviltwin> It's pretty straightforward and simple if you know advanced JavaScript
[13:39:58] <Eviltwin> Yeah
[13:40:27] <garbagecollectio> getsElementByID Foo
[13:40:35] <garbagecollectio> by resetting the this
[13:40:36] <garbagecollectio> to document
[13:40:42] <garbagecollectio> returns it
[13:40:46] <garbagecollectio> in function x
[13:40:54] <garbagecollectio> its straightforward but theres a lot moving, i disagree
[13:41:28] <garbagecollectio> shame on you for claiming otherwise
[13:41:39] <shoky> you answered it in 3 minutes..
[13:41:44] <Eviltwin> shoky: You knew that that did at a glance, right?
[13:42:06] <shoky> Eviltwin, about 10 seconds ;p
[13:42:14] <garbagecollectio> you mean as I'm looking a jquery source code?
[13:42:16] <garbagecollectio> lol
[13:42:48] <garbagecollectio> if its a 10 second question why is it "hard"
[13:43:11] <Eviltwin> I have it there for people who claim they know JavaScript
[13:43:13] <garbagecollectio> the harder question is how does jquery alias $ for jqUEry
[13:43:18] <garbagecollectio> yah and I got it right
[13:43:26] <garbagecollectio> so apologize plz
[13:43:28] <shoky> window.$ = jQuery;
[13:43:31] <Eviltwin> A lot slower than a pro would have
[13:43:31] <shoky> or someshit
[13:43:31] <garbagecollectio> for your basic advanced question
[13:43:53] <garbagecollectio> put downs definitely not necessary Eviltwin
[13:43:59] <garbagecollectio> especially when someone got the question right
[13:44:05] <garbagecollectio> and was looking at other stuff
[13:44:11] <garbagecollectio> sounds like you have a lot you want to prove
[13:44:20] <Eviltwin> What you're asking is so much more incredibly simple that what's going on in that question
[13:44:24] <Eviltwin> It's setting a damn variable
[13:44:26] <shoky> garbagecollectio: let it go.. you were asking something so simple
[13:44:32] <garbagecollectio> i get that
[13:44:37] <garbagecollectio> but thats not sufficient dude
[13:45:03] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/A4875/
[13:45:04] <Eviltwin> There
[13:45:11] <Eviltwin> That's how it sets $ and jQuery
[13:45:28] <Eviltwin> What's not to understand?
[13:47:12] <Eviltwin> My tone would be a lot nicer right now if you hadn't said "so apologize plz"
[13:47:23] <garbagecollectio> you should apologise
[13:47:29] <shoky> lol didnt notice that
[13:47:30] <garbagecollectio> i got your question right
[13:48:06] <garbagecollectio> Eviltwin, my turn then
[13:48:21] <shoky> ;D
[13:48:21] <Eviltwin> If I told you I know how to exponentiate but not multiply would you think there was some unusual gap in my knowledge?
[13:49:37] <Eviltwin> I linked you something that shows exactly how to set window.$ and window.jQuery to the same function
[13:49:43] <Eviltwin> This is an intermediate-level concept at best
[13:49:53] <Eviltwin> Which is why I'm having trouble understanding what you don't understand about it
[13:50:42] <oojacoboo> I just feel the need to say how much I dislike the new api docs… why are they so hard to read
[13:51:04] <Eviltwin> I do miss the old ones
[13:51:10] <oojacoboo> it's like… where are the params… it's confusing with all the version added junk and the same params repeated like 10x
[13:51:14] <shoky> theyre a bit less nice imo, but not too bad
[13:51:33] <oojacoboo> I have to read them 2-3x to see whats actually going on :/
[13:51:59] <garbagecollectio> Eviltwin:
[13:52:02] <Eviltwin> It'd be nice if there were anchors at every heading
[13:52:07] <Eviltwin> And on every paragraph
[13:52:14] <Eviltwin> So I could link someone to exactly the right section
[13:52:28] <garbagecollectio> why would one ever put something like self = this inside a function
[13:52:30] <oojacoboo> yea, that'd be cool, but also a better explanation of the params
[13:52:50] <oojacoboo> I mean, that's really the only reason I go there, to see what arguments a method takes
[13:53:43] <oojacoboo> and it'd be nice to know what scope is returned for "this" as well
[13:53:54] <oojacoboo> or rather, what each method returns in general
[13:54:02] <garbagecollectio> it takes you that long to google Eviltwin
[13:54:12] <garbagecollectio> this is either a know it or you don't question
[13:54:18] <garbagecollectio> facts
[13:54:31] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/SBxcp/
[13:54:40] <oojacoboo> :)
[13:54:44] <Eviltwin> Sorry due
[13:54:45] <oojacoboo> lol
[13:54:46] <Eviltwin> dude*
[13:54:48] <Eviltwin> I'm sick of your shit
[13:54:51] <oojacoboo> I was about to say man!
[13:54:53] <shoky> ;]
[13:55:18] <relipse> does anyone know of a plugin like this http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable only better/more updated?
[13:55:20] <Eviltwin> You messed with the wrong guy
[13:56:28] <shoky> at least you apologized
[13:56:43] <Eviltwin> I did aplogize
[13:56:47] <Eviltwin> Now he has no right to complain
[13:58:03] <Whirl3d_> opinion: if you are writing a plugin that has an element, target, controls and then settings, do you just wrap it all up in settings or is it okay to call those pieces out separate?
[13:58:10] <Whirl3d_> *seperately
[13:58:38] <Whirl3d_> lol *separately....really...
[13:58:49] <Eviltwin> The jQuery UI widget factory has an option/options method that lets you set options after the initial creation
[13:59:21] <Eviltwin> Generally it's faster to do it all up front but if you want to initialize a bunch of elements with only slight differences then it's handy
[13:59:24] <Whirl3d_> Sure, but do you ever call out specific non-defaultable options
[13:59:27] <sunbeam> i'd like to hide/remove all tr of which its td cell is empty
[13:59:30] <sunbeam> how can I do that?
[13:59:33] <sunbeam> (one or more td)
[14:00:06] <oojacoboo> $("tr td:empty").hide();
[14:00:19] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d_: You mean like setting options of a widget at initialization?
[14:00:24] <sunbeam> oojacoboo: i want to hide the tr
[14:00:26] <oojacoboo> sunbeam: actually
[14:00:33] <oojacoboo> $("tr td:empty").parent().hide();
[14:00:42] <oojacoboo> or
[14:00:50] <oojacoboo> $("tr td:empty").closest("tr").hide();
[14:00:58] <Whirl3d_> No, sir, I mean like you can't set the default "target" property of an "incrementable" object....
[14:01:37] <Whirl3d_> so rather than this.settings.target=.....   you would just have this.target=
[14:01:47] <sunbeam> oojacoboo: thanks, didn't know :empty
[14:01:54] <sunbeam> oojacoboo: does this also work in css?
[14:01:59] <oojacoboo> no
[14:03:02] <Whirl3d_> so that could be updated later with a method to set options or to setTarget or what have you. I was just curious if in your instantiation, is it bad practice to call out individual settings or options? or just keep them together in this.options...
[14:03:52] <Whirl3d_> Maybe that was a "yes", but I didn't mean only at instantiion. sorry
[14:03:59] <relipse> does anyone know of a plugin like this http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable only better/more updated?
[14:04:17] <Eviltwin> It's up to you but I generally consider it cleaner to have user settings in a separate namespace than your functions and whatnot
[14:05:00] <Whirl3d_> said like that makes great sense. Thanks.
[14:10:53] <Whirl3d_> lol. I was just realizing that I am writing a jquery plugin for a small (and I mean small) portion of a HUGe project due tomorrow that is 80% PHP and 19% WordPress....that's funny.
[14:16:04] <Es0teric> how do you listen for a keyup event and a click event for the same element? (such as pressing enter on a input field or clicking submit to do the same thing)
[14:20:25] <relipse> Es0teric: .click(function(){ //do stuff }).keyup(function(){ //do stuff });
[14:21:08] <relipse> or if you are slick you can make a function put it in a variable and pass the 2 same variables to click() and keyup()
[14:22:15] <rakl> when does an POST request enter the error callback? Is it based on a status code? I don't see it in the documentation
[14:23:39] <Es0teric> relipse thats intresting
[14:23:47] <Es0teric> thanks, relipse
[14:24:13] <Eviltwin> rakl: $.post, $.get, etc are all just simplified versions of $.ajax
[14:24:21] <Eviltwin> The error conditions should be explained here: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:24:34] <Eviltwin> And GET and POST should have the same error conditions
[14:24:42] <rakl> ah ok. i'll read that, thanks
[14:25:06] <Eviltwin> Yeah, read the bit that explains the "error" setting
[14:28:16] <rakl> Eviltwin I scrolled through and it's not very clear when the error callback fires. Is it only for 4xx and 5xx states?
[14:28:54] <rakl> is it only based on http status codes?
[14:29:04] <Eviltwin> A big part of it is status codes
[14:29:18] <Eviltwin> But if you try to make a cross-domain request for example you'll get an error
[14:29:58] <Eviltwin> It might be best to read documentation on XMLHttpRequest errors instead
[14:31:44] <Eviltwin> rakl: If you look under the documentation for the open() and send() methods of the XHR I think all of the error conditions are defined: http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/
[14:31:50] <Eviltwin> It's kind of messy to read though
[14:33:37] <rakl> hmm ok will do. In the context of a Rails backend, I just need to return the right thing so the call will enter the error calback
[14:41:31] <Eviltwin> rakl: Well any HTTP 4xx or 5xx staus code should do that
[14:41:53] <Eviltwin> It's really a question of choosing the right status code for the job: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#4xx_Client_Error
[14:43:54] <rakl> Eviltwin if I want to create a record and the record already exists, is 409 Conflict appropriate?
[14:44:39] <rakl> this is probably not a question for this channel, but since we are already talking about it..
[15:34:29] <Whirl3d_> does anyone know how to constrain .sortable to vertical movement only?
[15:44:22] <erasmas> has anyone run into an issue with jquerytools where the height isn't calculated correctly? it's making the overlay size much shorter than the image it's showing for me
[15:59:52] <relipse> is there a way to figure out the length of an input in correspondance to the length of the text value ? (i want to resize my input based on the number of characters contained in the value)
[16:05:08] <dblosevn_> Whirl3d_: didnt i show you the other day?
[16:07:35] <dblosevn_> Whirl3d_: http://www.sebringcomputers.com/admin/product-type.php?tmpadmin=true you have to make it sortable/draggable
[16:10:14] <Whirl3d_> I was looking for your post from the other day. I swear I couldn't find dbsolven in  my browser history
[16:10:16] <Whirl3d_> lol
[16:10:18] <dblosevn_> actually thats not what i did, $('selector').sortable({containment: 'parent'});
[16:11:16] <Es0teric> how do you check if an object contains a word in a string?
[16:11:17] <Whirl3d_> now I have it bookmarked. pfew
[16:11:24] <dblosevn_> i bet you couldnt find dbsolven lol im dblosevn Dbl O Seven 007 lol
[16:11:37] <Es0teric> how do you check if a value in a object contains a word in a string? ***
[16:11:55] <Es0teric> or has a word in a string
[16:12:24] <Whirl3d_> I hate being dyslexic
[16:12:41] <dblosevn_> if(obj.param.test(/word/))
[16:13:54] <dblosevn_> @ Es0teric
[16:14:06] <Es0teric> dblosevn_ wait wait... obj.param.test() ?
[16:14:17] <Es0teric> what is .param supposed to be?
[16:14:27] <dblosevn_> the member of the object
[16:14:43] <dblosevn_> like obj.cat.test(/black/)
[16:14:43] <Es0teric> dblosevn_ so you mean... obj['key1']?
[16:15:07] <Es0teric> dblosevn_ but the keys in the object are strings...
[16:15:18] <dblosevn_> they have to be a string
[16:15:25] <Es0teric> oh
[16:15:27] <Es0teric> wait wait
[16:15:32] <Es0teric> ok i get it now.. i had a minor brain fart
[16:15:40] <dblosevn_> .test is a member of String()
[16:16:53] <dblosevn_> ?g javascript .test @ Es0teric
[16:16:54] <bot-t> Es0teric, JavaScript test() Method - http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_regexp_test.asp
[16:17:48] <dblosevn_> crap i got that backwards
[16:18:16] <dblosevn_> if(/word/.test(obj.cat))
[16:21:15] <Es0teric> dblosevn_ i get this -> TypeError: d.a.test is not a function
[16:21:30] <dblosevn_> read above
[16:21:46] <dblosevn_> [19:18] <dblosevn_> if(/word/.test(obj.cat))
[16:21:55] <dblosevn_> i got it backwards
[16:25:35] <Es0teric> dblosevn_ ohhh
[16:27:48] <Es0teric> dblosevn_ i still get nothing because this value i am trying to search for is coming from an input field and /q.val()/ doesnt output what i am looking for
[16:30:42] <dblosevn_> var re = RegExp(q.val,"g"); if(re.test(obj.cat))
[16:30:52] <dblosevn_> sorry q.val()
[16:32:04] <dblosevn_> make that "gi" to make it case insensitive
[16:33:10] <Es0teric> dblosevn_ holy shit... that actually worked
[16:33:27] <dblosevn_> :-)
[16:33:42] <dblosevn_> you didnt mention at first that word was a variable
[16:33:44] <Es0teric> thanks, dblosevn_
[16:33:57] <Es0teric> lol dblosevn_ well yeah that is true
[16:34:04] <Es0teric> but i am using a combination of underscorejs
[16:34:05] <Es0teric> and jquery
[16:34:10] <Es0teric> so i use underscore's filtering
[16:34:39] <dblosevn_> for simple stuff like that i just use regex
[16:34:53] <Es0teric> dblosevn_ i was always bad at regex
[16:34:57] <Es0teric> so it didnt cross my mind to use it
[16:35:16] <Es0teric> lol
[16:35:31] <dblosevn_> wish i could figure out what i did with my tablet, its hosing my name
[16:35:52] <dblosevn_> whereever it is it oviously has internt lol
[16:38:35] <Es0teric> lol dblosevn_
[16:38:49] <dblosevn_> its definitely here just dont know where
[16:38:57] <relipse> should i try using $().data() ?
[16:39:12] <dblosevn_> to do what relipse?
[16:39:27] <dblosevn_> and its got a full charge so it will be like 6 days before it dies
[16:39:44] <relipse> instead of .attr()
[16:39:56] <dblosevn_> umm that wont work
[16:40:07] <relipse> i saw another programmer using data-foobar="blah" to hold data
[16:40:17] <dblosevn_> oh
[16:40:18] <relipse> and i normally use a new attribute
[16:40:27] <relipse> but mabye it is smarter to use data-mynewattr="blah"
[16:40:32] <relipse> what do you think?
[16:40:32] <dblosevn_> ya use .data for data- attribs
[16:40:41] <relipse> what is a data- attribute?
[16:40:51] <relipse> i mean what is the glory in using them?
[16:40:54] <kaidez> relipse maybe use .prop() instead?
[16:40:57] <dblosevn_> data-foo="bar"
[16:41:01] <systemfault> :/
[16:41:10] <relipse> i know how to use them i'm asking what is the purpose
[16:41:21] <systemfault> jquery mixed everything :/
[16:41:24] <relipse> ok i've made up my mind, i'll try using them
[16:41:35] <relipse> i think they are for user-specified data
[16:41:35] <dblosevn_> relipse: youd use data- attribs for things like product ids etc
[16:41:50] <relipse> well you know how value="" contains the value of an input
[16:42:01] <relipse> i want to put oldvalue="<oldvalue-before-editing>"
[16:42:04] <systemfault> relipse: The short answer, use .data all the time.
[16:42:10] <relipse> is it better to put it in data?
[16:42:20] <dblosevn_> <div data-product-id="124" class="product">
[16:42:21] <relipse> ok thanks systemfault
[16:42:32] <systemfault> Using .data is better because it doesn't need to access the DOM,so it's faster.
[16:42:51] <rabx> How can I test if my script reaches my ajax call? http://jsbin.com/abafeg/1/edit
[16:43:17] <systemfault> rabx: console.log?
[16:43:17] <dblosevn_> look at the net tab in the debugger and see if a request is made
[16:43:26] <systemfault> dblosevn++
[16:43:29] <dblosevn_> that too
[16:44:04] <rabx> haven't tried console yet.. but just by looking at my script... if there are no errors, is the syntax correct?
[16:44:32] <dblosevn_> if you havent looked at the console how do you know there are no errors?
[16:44:41] <dblosevn_> errors appear in the console...
[16:45:21] <dblosevn_> if no errors are seen in the console then the error is not syntax it is logical
[16:46:57] <rabx> Well, lets not get too crazy. When I test the newsletter sign up, I receive the intended output when there are errors and I receive the intended output if it was successful. However, I am not sure where my issue is - whether it's the way I am writing the ajax call or if it's my php script
[16:48:20] <rabx> I ran console.log() and it says "post http://url/newsletter.php"
[16:48:30] <rabx> I guess the issue is related to my php script and not my ajax call
[16:49:03] <rabx> Although, I don't see any data in the Post tab nor in the Response
[16:52:29] <rabx> Thoughts?
[16:55:15] <dblosevn_> id test your php script and are you using firefox? if so i have had many cases where the post tab was blank but post data was really sent
[16:56:14] <rabx> I am using FF and I think the php script is fine - I got it from php.net somewhere
[16:56:58] <rabx> ajax is sending my data to the php script and the php script is outputting to a file - permissions are correct
[16:57:40] <rabx> the file is blank and not being written to
[16:57:55] <may857091> hi~~
[16:59:49] <may857091>  jQuery UI 1.10.0 datapicker  is large
[17:00:17] <may857091> help!!
[17:00:51] <systemfault> open the .js file, ctrl+a then press backspace.
[17:00:56] <rabx> lol
[17:00:58] <systemfault> It should make the file smaller.
[17:01:57] <may857091> .ui-datepicker   add  font: 62.5%;
[17:01:57] <rabx> dblosevn - I realize I didn't share the whole script. I am guessing you had a chance to look at the js portion of it. Do you mind taking a look? The php part at the bottom in html is newsletter.php - http://jsbin.com/uwibil/1/edit
[17:02:07] <may857091> but no change??
[17:05:21] <woopwoop> is this the right way of adding one object to another? doing a facebook app to get the album list as well as an api get within the request to get the cover photo url http://jsfiddle.net/S4k48/
[17:07:30] <may857091> help!!
[17:07:50] <dblosevn_> rabx: your not sending a response back to the client for success or failure
[17:08:22] <may857091> I'm not English, but I have a problem
[17:08:52] <may857091> Someone help me.
[17:09:16] <dblosevn_> rabx: also instead of opening the file reading appending and rewriteing the file you can simply do file_put_contents($file, $newsletter."\n", FILE_APPEND);
[17:09:24] <relipse> how can i use jquery to dynamically resize the width of an input based on its text value
[17:09:54] <rabx> Ok, I will try the php change - how do I resolve the ajax issue?
[17:10:05] <dblosevn_> i told you
[17:10:11] <rabx> send a response back
[17:10:23] <dblosevn_> you arent sending a response back to the client for success or failure
[17:12:13] <may857091> Someone help me??
[17:12:14] <dblosevn_> rabx: http://jsbin.com/uwibil/4/edit
[17:13:30] <coldhead> may857091: can you be more specific?
[17:14:22] <dblosevn_> aww i thought we were psychics lol
[17:14:27] <dark> may857091, you need to describe your problem before someone can help you
[17:14:30] <dblosevn_> anyways off to get food ill bbl
[17:14:31] <may857091> coldhead: ui-datepicker is too large
[17:14:45] <rabx> dblosevn I see what you mean now. I guess this is a logic issue. I have two booleans that check for bad emails outside of "//alert an error for bad email".
[17:15:33] <may857091> coldhead:jquery-ui-1.10.0.custom.css
[17:15:54] <may857091> .ui-datepicker { width: 17em; padding: .2em .2em 0;}
[17:16:15] <may857091> modify it to add
[17:16:29] <may857091> font-size: 62%;
[17:16:56] <may857091> but datapicker is not change
[17:17:07] <dblosevn_> rabx: i see that but looking at the code, i dont see an issue with the post or the php script, so maybe your regexes arent working on the client side and improperly doing the post
[17:17:47] <coldhead> font-size: 62%!important;
[17:17:52] <coldhead> that works for me
[17:18:05] <may857091> coldhead: Do you understand my question?
[17:18:34] <coldhead> i think so
[17:19:31] <dblosevn_> may857091: do you understand his answer? lol add !important after font-size: 62%; `font-size: 62%!important; to override the font-size in the stylesheeet
[17:19:39] <rabx> dblosevn_ alright, I'll remove the second expression
[17:19:58] <may857091> coldhead: it is run ,thanks
[17:20:02] <coldhead> may857091: http://jsfiddle.net/keEcy/
[17:20:25] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's take a 5 minute break
[17:20:56] <may857091> coldhead :Thank you very much
[17:21:05] <dblosevn_> im sayin lol
[17:21:18] <dblosevn_> gotta go grab some smokes and food ill bbl
[17:21:19] <Afflicto> Hey guys, I just pushed this jquery plugin to my github but it's not showing up in the jQuery plugin (I have added the post-receive hook). Here's my repo: https://github.com/afflicto/jQuery.pairAttr - thanks in advance.
[17:22:56] <dblosevn_> welll right after monk is over
[17:23:34] <coldhead> Afflicto: you might like to ask in #jQuery-dev too
[17:24:00] <coldhead> yay monk!
[17:24:29] <may857091> Thank you for help,bye bye
[17:24:56] <Afflicto> coldhead: yea I wasn't sure about that, it says on the site that -dev is for core dev though :P
[17:26:19] <coldhead> this is a core problem, Afflicto
[17:26:30] <coldhead> those are the dudes who did the plugin integration
[17:26:58] <coldhead> anyway your question will remain on screen longer there because there is less traffic and nonsense :P
[17:29:21] <dblosevn_> do you have 3 quarters or a hammer... gotta love monk lol
[17:31:56] <bambanx> hello
[17:32:27] <bambanx> guys anyone know how make this grid or if a knowen plugin , the grey grid on images here http://wpdemo.themnific.com/pre/14/ , are nice
[17:34:06] <rabx> dblosevn_ removing the second regex didn't help. Do you mind if I share with you the actual site via pm?
[17:34:29] <dblosevn_> go ahead
[17:34:44] <dblosevn_> then im really getting something to eat lol
[17:35:11] <rabx> might take a hot second... reverting back
[17:35:48] <coldhead> bambanx: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/ and http://masonry.desandro.com/
[17:36:07] <bambanx> thanks coldhead !!!
[17:36:44] <coldhead> have fun :D
[17:37:44] <bambanx> i hope lol
[17:38:54] <bambanx> coldhead, u sure are that? i mean in the top image slider, this images have like a grey grid opacity on each image http://wpdemo.themnific.com/pre/14/
[17:39:13] <coldhead> oh i thought you meant the image gallery further down
[17:39:20] <bambanx> no
[17:39:36] <bambanx> the top slider have each image life a effect
[17:39:42] <coldhead> you mean the cathode ray effect thing
[17:39:47] <coldhead> i haven't seen a plugin for that
[17:39:52] <bambanx> i dunnow how its the named
[17:39:58] <coldhead> no me either
[17:40:04] <bambanx> but is cool
[17:40:45] <bambanx> maybe ore easy for me make it in photoshop lol
[17:41:03] <coldhead> this looks similar http://sjhewitt.co.uk/2012/07/javascript-glitch-effect-glitch-js/
[17:41:14] <coldhead> but it does more and it does it with canvas so IE won't support it
[17:41:25] <coldhead> i'd be leaning on photoshop, yeah
[17:41:43] <bambanx> i dont care ie
[17:41:52] <bambanx> my project will be used on chrome
[17:42:14] <coldhead> see if you can be bothered getting the relevant code from that plugin
[17:42:24] <coldhead> or look for where that guy borrowed the code from
[17:42:31] <coldhead> then just do it in photoshop anyway :P
[17:44:35] <bambanx> damn i need to draw a lot of lines in photoshop hahahha
[17:46:12] <coldhead> bambanx: you could try bravely asking in ##css if anyone knows a way to create that effect
[17:46:48] <bambanx> i cannot use css
[17:47:01] <bambanx> well maybge yes cos i am using aqdobe edge for my project and it use jquery
[17:47:08] <bambanx> and i can uyse images of photoshop
[17:47:16] <bambanx> i am dfoing a html5 animations
[17:47:34] <bambanx> i dont have time to learn how use css in edge cos is for tomorrow
[17:48:01] <coldhead> sounds like a job for photoshop then!
[17:48:06] <bambanx> yeah
[17:48:22] <bambanx> and then use a fade
[18:01:56] <coldhead> great work everyone, let's take a short break
[18:09:27] <relipse> why does $(my_label).html('blah'); not work
[18:10:15] <oojacoboo> relipse: <my_label> ?

[18:10:37] <oojacoboo> it my_label a var?
[18:20:10] <bambanx> thanks coldhead
[18:31:58] <relipse> can i put code on github if i extended off of some gpl code?
[18:35:22] <coldhead> of course, relipse
[18:35:39] <coldhead> you need to include the GPL on your extension of course
[18:36:57] <tw2113> i vote wtfpl when applicable
[18:37:10] <toad-br> Guys! I need help on the project: https://github.com/joaoneto/FwText/ anyone interested please contact. Thx
[18:40:13] <bambanx> good night coldhead and thanks for all

[18:41:31] <Forbidd3n> anyone know of a good accordion validation script that uses rules, I already tried - http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/multipart/ - doesn't allow rules
[18:41:39] <Forbidd3n> for multiple steps
[18:41:51] <Forbidd3n> within one form
[18:59:04] <relipse> can someone look at this plugin https://github.com/relipse/jQuery-Editable/blob/master/jquery.editable.js and help me get it so that when the user blurs the input it automatically calls onFreeze() and sends the data via ajax: http://paste.ee/r/HAZUf
[19:06:49] <dblosevn_> hmm ive used .editable before and did ajax updates on blur out of the box i dont know about onfreeze
[19:10:34] <rabx> Thanks to dblosevn_ for helping me with a critical issue during his Monk episode. Thanks again!

[21:02:25] <Palanivel> Hi Hi...Good morning to everyone
[21:03:45] <Palanivel> i need a one clarification as - XMLHttpRequest cannot load Error coming in chrome
[21:04:08] <Palanivel> But FF is working finw
[21:04:10] <Palanivel> fine
[21:04:18] <b1lly> Palanivel: you working with Ajax/
[21:04:26] <b1lly> can you show me snippet? of code?
[21:04:27] <Palanivel> Yeap...!!!
[21:05:39] <Palanivel> In wd plugin only i got this error
[21:06:30] <Ritzton> hello
[21:06:39] <Palanivel> i downloaded locally and using local json file there...
[21:08:25] <Palanivel> in FF is working fine but in chrome throwing XMLHttpRequest cannot load Error
[21:08:39] <nesoi> hello... I'm using jquery-mobile and trying to display a list of several hundred items. This is taking a very long time, like 1 second per 100 items. Is there something I can do to speed this up?
[21:09:05] <nesoi> maybe 2 seconds per 100 items, depending
[21:10:32] <b1lly> Palanivel: I dont know what your trying to do, or what you did to get there
[21:10:34] <b1lly> I need to see an example
[21:10:48] <Ritzton> I am learning jquery mobile and I have a question, I am trying to make just a simple application, when the user is going on the index; he has to share his gps coordinates, and then according to his coordinate, a listview is display. I know how to display a list view and how to catch the gps coordinate, but what is the right way to make it together ? do I have to do an ajax query to get html
[21:10:48] <Ritzton> content and then do $(div).html(response) ?
[21:15:22] <Ritzton> I mean I am talking about the structure of the page, I would like to know the right way using jquery mobile
[21:16:36] <nesoi> Ritzton : wouldn't you just capture the gps, do the lookup, get the data, then append the data into the listview and trigger the listview?
[21:16:40] <nesoi> to refresh it
[21:17:03] <nesoi> no one here seems to use jquery mobile that I've run into
[21:17:32] <jrockjiggz> anyone know if its possible to load ajax js script that will be saved as a function?
[21:19:06] <Ritzton> nesoi> I dont think this is a good idea because the user has the possibility to not share his coordinates so the listview would be useless
[21:20:21] <Ritzton> is it possible with jquery to make a redirect to another page and post data at the same time ?
[21:21:07] <Cork> Ritzton: create a form element, add the post data as hidden values set the target as action, and do $('form').submit()
[21:21:53] <Ritzton> Cork is it the best way ?
[21:22:01] <Cork> Ritzton: its the only way
[21:22:14] <Cork> unless you load a plugin that do it for you (create the form and submit it)
[21:22:30] <Ritzton> I see
[21:22:56] <Cork> form post is the only post form that is allowed to cross domains
[21:23:05] <Cork> (real html form post that is)
[21:23:30] <Ritzton> to cross domains ?
[21:23:39] <Ritzton> I dont want to cross domain, it is on the same
[21:23:40] <Cork> the target is another domain then the one your on
[21:23:43] <Cork> ok
[21:23:48] <Cork> then there is one other option
[21:23:55] <Ritzton> which one ?
[21:24:07] <Cork> do an ajax post, and on success set the new url at window.location = new-url
[21:24:27] <Cork> but that means you do two calls to the server
[21:24:52] <Ritzton> hum ?
[21:24:58] <Ritzton> I dont understand this one
[21:26:03] <Cork> ex. $.post(url, data).done(function() { window.location = url; });
[21:26:13] <Cork> that means it does first a post to url with the data
[21:26:23] <Cork> and if that is successful it does a get call to the url
[21:26:46] <Ritzton> yeah but that's not what I want to do
[21:27:03] <Cork> those are the only two options to do post with full page reload
[21:27:09] <Ritzton> because I want to use the variable I am posting on the page I want to redirect...
[21:27:13] <nesoi> Cork : do you have any hints or ideas about how to display several hundred rows of a list quickly? I am trying to display a user's contacts but it's taking 20-30 sec...
[21:27:35] <Cork> nesoi: infinite-scrolls
[21:27:43] <Cork> push them say 50 at a time
[21:27:53] <Cork> and when the user scrolls down send 50 more
[21:27:58] <Cork> and so on
[21:28:03] <danheberden> Ritzton: you having to support ie6/7?
[21:28:08] <Cork> ?g infinite-scroll @ nesoi
[21:28:14] <Cork> sigh
[21:28:18] * Cork hits bot-t
[21:28:46] <Cork> nesoi: http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
[21:28:59] <Cork> danheberden: why does that matter?
[21:29:14] <danheberden> Cork, i was going to recommend he use localStorage if he needs to persist data across pages
[21:29:30] <Cork> danheberden: you still have to do two calls to the server
[21:29:42] <Cork> dan2k3k4: and localStorage sucks in performance
[21:29:50] <danheberden> Cork, nvm then
[21:30:00] <danheberden> sounds like you got it handled
[21:30:34] <Cork> localStorage is syncronus, so each time you load a page from a site that uses it, the browser has to stop for disk io to pull everything stored in localStorage
[21:30:39] <Ritzton> danheberden> I dont have any specific requirements, but it is better if it works on more browsers
[21:30:46] <Cork> so you pay for localStorage on every page on your site
[21:31:18] <danheberden> Cork, i wasn't under the impression that ever page on his site needed this feature
[21:31:37] <danheberden> i was merely trying to offer a suggestion of a possible feature that would allow him to accomplish his goal
[21:31:56] <danheberden> (And sorry Ritzton if assuming "he" is rude or incorrect towards you)
[21:32:00] <Cork> danheberden: nope, but the specs say it has to be available synchronous to js, so the browser has to load it before js runs, just so it can be available
[21:32:13] <nesoi> cork: the problem with infinite scroll is that I want the list to be searchable, and I think it won't be searchable unless it's all loaded, no?
[21:32:29] <Cork> danheberden: if localStorage was async it could be loaded when needed
[21:32:43] <Cork> nesoi: it would have to be server side ya
[21:32:59] <nesoi> Cork : this is a phonegap app
[21:33:17] <Cork> nesoi: an option is to grab it all and then hold them in a variable
[21:33:27] <Cork> then just add the one needed to the dom
[21:33:44] <N3X> nesoi: u in #phonegap?
[21:34:03] <nesoi> how do you mean Cork? I tried putting it all in a giant string and .appending the string at once, but that didn't speed things up
[21:34:09] <nesoi> N3X : not atm
[21:34:16] <Cork> nesoi: http://christianheilmann.com/2013/01/25/five-things-you-can-do-to-make-html5-perform-better/
[21:34:21] <Cork> might be interesting read
[21:34:34] <nesoi> thanks cork
[21:35:31] <nesoi> yeah, the touch thing is good, but that still doesn't help me with big lists
[21:36:01] <nesoi> I'm thinking of switching to native java because of this :(
[21:36:17] <Cork> nesoi: check the "reuse section"
[21:37:00] <nesoi> hm. not sure how I'd do that
[21:37:13] <nesoi> sounds very clever though
[21:37:14] <Cork> nesoi: and java on a webapp is a TERRIBLE idea
[21:37:22] <nesoi> this is a phone app
[21:37:38] <nesoi> android apps are written in java
[21:37:42] <nesoi> typically
[21:37:44] <Cork> especially as java has had 50+ sandbox breach bugs the last year
[21:37:53] <Cork> and still have 3 open bugs
[21:38:00] <Cork> (unpatched)
[21:38:15] <nesoi> this is a different java, not on a browser, but anyway, how would one implement that kind of scrolling that they suggest?
[21:38:32] <Cork> nesoi: are you sending the list as ajax?
[21:39:17] <nesoi> cork: I make some API calls using javascript on the page, then take the data out of an array, format it, and write it as <li> elements
[21:39:45] <Cork> nesoi: so you generate the html/dom locally?
[21:39:52] <nesoi> yeah
[21:39:55] <nesoi> everything is local
[21:40:37] <Cork> then you could either 1. don't generate all the lists first, and search in the array
[21:40:56] <Cork> 2. generate all the dom from array, but store it in js and not append it to dom
[21:41:13] <Cork> btw how are you generating the list?
[21:41:50] <nesoi> right, I was thinking of #1. but how would I do the scrolling they mention in that article - reusing just the elements that fit on the screen
[21:41:53] <nesoi> that seemed very clever
[21:42:43] <Cork> nesoi: you either use a fake scrollbar, or you use a replacement element for the offset
[21:42:57] <Cork> nesoi: but before that, there might be another reason for your slowdown
[21:43:03] <nesoi> on a phone you don't scroll like that
[21:43:06] <Cork> so, how are you generating the list dom?
[21:43:07] <nesoi> you scroll by flipping
[21:43:14] <nesoi> damn I have to run.
[21:43:21] <Cork> nesoi: then the problem is even less
[21:43:21] <nesoi> maybe I'll see you next time, thanks for being helpful
[21:43:45] <Cork> then you just have to generate the dom for that page, and keep the rest in the array
[21:44:19] <lresende> is pageinit event supposed to get fired when you do a back ?
[22:12:45] <Whirl3d_> dblosevn, or anyone, mind looking at my fiddle to see why it's not working?http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/HRwES/14/
[22:12:58] <Whirl3d_> I can't get the sortable() to work
[22:13:25] <Cork> Whirl3d_: place make sure to have spaces around your url's; makes them easier to open :)
[22:13:49] <danheberden> Whirl3d_: it works
[22:13:53] <danheberden> but you have to drag the border
[22:14:01] <Whirl3d_> gladly. On my screen it is automatically linkable, so I aplogize.
[22:14:03] <danheberden> which should expose a new problem you have
[22:14:28] <Whirl3d_> Why doesn't it drag with the handlebar?
[22:15:03] <Whirl3d_> it drags but doesn't actually reposition
[22:15:23] <Cork> Whirl3d_: wfm
[22:15:31] <Cork> i can drag them around just fine
[22:15:53] <Cork> through the blue or yellow areas
[22:15:56] <Whirl3d_> Type text into the first one and then drag it to the third position. Mine reverts to the first position where you typed it
[22:16:10] <Whirl3d_> I don't see any blue areas, for example
[22:16:17] <Whirl3d_> odd behavior
[22:16:50] <danheberden> Whirl3d_: the issue is your containment
[22:17:01] <danheberden> because it keeps the element locked on the x axis
[22:17:07] <danheberden> your mouse never hovers over the elements
[22:17:13] <Cork> Whirl3d_: http://imagebin.org/244505
[22:17:19] <Whirl3d_> Which is *exactly what I need
[22:17:47] <Whirl3d_> My entire goal is to restict dragging to the y axis only
[22:17:50] <danheberden> Whirl3d_: so either make space for the handle at all times
[22:18:05] <danheberden> so that when you see it and use it, it can trigger a hover on the other sortables
[22:18:19] <danheberden> or increase the width of each li upon dragStart.
[22:18:24] <danheberden> i suggest the former
[22:18:31] <Whirl3d_> oh, I see what you mean. I didn't think about that...
[22:19:02] <Whirl3d_> Cork, what browser are you using?
[22:20:12] <Cork> Whirl3d_: firefox
[22:20:14] <Whirl3d_> Mine looks like this:  http://i.imgur.com/NXM7c4j.png
[22:20:50] <Cork> Whirl3d_: but i get the same in chromium
[22:21:12] <Whirl3d_> how messed up is that? I don't know why
[22:21:32] <Cork> Whirl3d_: http://imagebin.org/244506 <-- chromium
[22:23:04] <Whirl3d_> I can't get firefox to work at all.
[22:23:43] <Whirl3d_> Oh, I forgot, every time I launch firefox, there's 30 minutes of updates to load...
[22:23:57] <Cork> <_<
[22:24:00] <Whirl3d_> and 30 minutes of compatibility problems
[22:24:06] <Cork> you don't have the update service?
[22:24:23] <Cork> if not you should download a new install and just install
[22:25:28] <Whirl3d_> I guess. FF really lost me as both and advocate and a user when it started getting so blown out that you couldn't just launch it and use it without tons of updates.
[22:27:16] <zubelgenubi> in jquerymobile, i need to hide/show a field after flipswitch fires
[22:27:24] <Whirl3d_> ugg and no clean install option either. Frustrating
[22:28:00] <zubelgenubi> cant figure out what selector to use in the enhanced markup
[22:28:11] <zubelgenubi> i mean for the flipswitch
[22:29:00] <Cork> Whirl3d_: just install over the old installation
[22:29:05] <Whirl3d_> Cork, so I see what you see in FF, why is my chrome display different.
[22:29:20] <Cork> then goto about:support and reset firefox...
[22:29:22] <Whirl3d_> It only gives the option to upgrade. So I uninstalled and reinstalled from scratch
[22:29:51] <Cork> Whirl3d_: chromium and firefox looks the same; except for the theme of the input field
[22:29:59] <Cork> *textarea
[22:30:25] <Cork> Whirl3d_: oh, right they did that new download minimalistic installer >_<
[22:30:29] <Cork> never used it...
[22:30:42] <juanignacioigles> Hey there!
[22:31:00] <Cork> Whirl3d_: just guessing but update should do it
[22:31:36] <juanignacioigles> I was wondering if anybody has successfully disabled the hashchange detection in JQM. I disabled (what I think is) every related option and it still attempts to load using AJAX.
[22:33:05] <Whirl3d_> So, I think it is a problem with the stylesheet handling (go figure) I had a typo that Chrome just skipped over, in FF it stopped processing the css after the typo..
[22:33:35] <Cork> Whirl3d_: where?
[22:33:53] <zubelgenubi> juan, sorry I haven't messed with default hashchange behavior, but when i dont want it to ajax, I just put data-ajax="false" on the <a>
[22:34:06] <Cork> Whirl3d_: you mean magin-bottom ?
[22:35:02] <Cork> Whirl3d_: and ya, if i fix that one the page breaks
[22:35:39] <Whirl3d_> I always forget to subtract padding...
[22:36:31] <Whirl3d_> Cork, danheberden, you guys are great! Problem solved finally. Thanks for your help.
[22:36:58] <juanignacioigles> zubelgenubi: Problem is, I'm not using a link but Backbone's Backbone.router.navigate. There shouldn't be any conflicts if the options mentioned in http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/backbone-require.html are disabled, but it still tries to load :(
[22:38:09] <zubelgenubi> im sorry friend, but I havent done anything with other frameworks..
[22:39:35] <zubelgenubi> just a suggestion, did you check out the source of http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/pages/Backbone-Require/index.html to compare it to your setup?
[22:39:46] <juanignacioigles> zubelgenubi: no worries dude, thanks for your help :)
[22:47:04] <DJDan> how do i create a start/stop timer that is triggered via a button? (so I can tell how long it took the user to do the survey)
[22:47:39] <djQuery> carfully
[22:48:06] <Cork> DJDan: when the button is clicked store the date value
[22:48:25] <Cork> DJDan: when you want to know the time subtract the currect time from the start variable
[22:49:32] <relipse> anyone know of a status bar div that always stays on bottom of window and yet always visible?
[22:49:53] <Cork> js> var start = new Date(); print((new Date()) - start))
[22:49:55] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[22:50:03] <Cork> ...
[22:50:24] <Cork> ralphholzmann: statusbar div?
[22:50:44] <relipse> why the ? mark?
[22:50:55] <Cork> ralphholzmann: whats wrong with position: fixed; bottom: 0; left: 0; right: 0; height: 24px; ?
[22:51:12] <relipse> i'll give it a shot thanks coaster
[22:51:13] <Cork> opps wrong nick :s
[22:51:14] <relipse> Cork
[22:51:18] <relipse> lol i did the same thing
[22:51:21] <Cork> :S
[22:51:22] <relipse> no blame
[22:51:23] <Cork> ^^
[22:51:37] <Cork> we ping ppl all over the place :)
[22:56:36] <relipse> ahh the perfect sstatus bar: http://paste.ee/r/WoLuh
[22:56:40] <relipse> beautiful
[22:57:59] <zubelgenubi> jqm docs not clear here, http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/forms/switch/events.html
[22:58:11] <zubelgenubi> what selector exactly can i use to do something on slidestop?
[22:58:28] <zubelgenubi> the slider generated has no id attributes
[22:58:39] <zubelgenubi> just my select tag that has been hidden
[23:00:16] <relipse> how can i set .html() and then 15 seconds later make it blank?
[23:00:34] <relipse> unless of course it is set to something else
[23:00:49] <gf3> relipse: What have you tried so far?
[23:03:30] <Cork> relipse: $(elm).html(something); setTimeout(function() { $(elm).empty(); }, 15000);
[23:03:45] <Cork> that won't care if the element is updated though
[23:08:47] <gf3> Cork: YOU CAN'T JUST TELL THEM THE ANSWER
[23:08:54] <gf3> Cork: THEN THEY LEARN NOTHING
[23:09:14] <Cork> gf3: yes they learn from the example
[23:09:25] <gf3> Psh
[23:09:31] <gf3> They get fat and lazy
[23:09:35] <Cork> just asking what they have tried when they don't even know where to start won't lead to anything
[23:10:01] <gf3> Cork: It makes them actually think about the issue, "oh shit, what have I done? Nothing."
[23:11:06] <gf3> I can see it now, poo downtrodden javascript novice heads to google "how to jquery delay 15 seconds"
[23:11:12] <gf3> BOOM! Learnage
[23:13:10] <gf3> s/poo/poor/
[23:13:15] <gf3> Not poo
[23:13:19] <gf3> Just for the record
[23:14:24] <zubelgenubi> tried this: $("#fac_gmphone_usestore" ).on( 'slidestop', function( event ) { log.console('switched!'); });
[23:14:44] <zubelgenubi> fac_gmphone_usestore is the id for the select
[23:14:49] <zubelgenubi> wont work
[23:15:55] <zubelgenubi> and cork, please dont listen to gf3.   right now 'just the answer' would work fine for me  ;)
[23:19:49] <zubelgenubi> oops, console.log...     well now that's working.
[23:24:58] <Cork> gf3: i don't see how they learn less from an answer over irc then an answer on some blog or forum somewhere
[23:25:26] <gf3> Cork: Yeah
[23:29:19] <Trisox> hey Cork little code monkey :D
[23:29:27] <Cork> o/
[23:29:34] <Trisox> \o/
[23:29:36] <Trisox> o//
[23:29:39] <Trisox> \\o
[23:39:40] <motka> hi commandos
[23:39:48] <motka> is it possible
[23:39:51] <motka> to
[23:40:04] <motka> trigger a keyboard key
[23:40:13] <Cork> uh.. you don't need to write one line per word...
[23:40:18] <motka> via jquery assets or with pure old fashion
[23:40:19] <motka> javascript?
[23:40:42] <Cork> no you can't fake user input at all in javascript
[23:40:43] <Ziber> Can I easily file a div with the contents of a file?
[23:40:47] <Ziber> *fill
[23:40:57] <Cork> Ziber: check the file api
[23:41:05] <Cork> won't work in older ie though
[23:42:24] <Cork> and by older i mean ie9
[23:42:29] <Cork> ie10 has partial support
[23:42:50] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/File
[23:42:53] <motka> how would you
[23:43:05] <motka> toggle browser fullscreen and normalscreen
[23:43:07] <motka> in firefox?
[23:43:09] <Cork> Ziber: thats assuming you mean a client side file by file?
[23:43:32] <Cork> motka: please don't split up a question on multiple lines if its not needed
[23:43:53] <Cork> Ziber: if the file is server side, just use .load
[23:44:19] <Cork> motka: in modern browsers you can ask for a dom element to be made fullscreen
[23:44:23] <Cork> thats the best you can do
[23:44:35] <motka> mensch!
[23:44:35] <Ziber> Cork: it's server-side...
[23:44:35] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/Using_fullscreen_mode
[23:44:36] <Ziber> Hm.
[23:44:40] <motka> you are not reading!
[23:44:45] <motka> TOGGLE, man, TOGGLE!
[23:44:53] <Cork> Ziber: so $(target).load(url);
[23:45:06] <Cork> motka: web doesn't have access to chrome
[23:45:30] <Cork> (chrome is the user interface)
[23:46:06] <motka> how come
[23:46:19] <motka> that you have a keyboard shortcut in ie. Firefox
[23:46:31] <motka> keyboard shortcut F11 to toggle the full screen
[23:46:32] <Cork> cause that would expose those features to malicious sites
[23:46:34] <motka> then also you have th e
[23:46:36] <motka> the*
[23:46:44] <motka> View => Fullscreen
[23:46:58] <motka> how come there's no special case for doing this
[23:47:05] <Cork> cause that would expose those features to malicious sites
[23:47:12] <motka> even if it will prompt for some authorisation
[23:47:17] <Cork> cause that would expose those features to malicious sites
[23:47:19] <Cork> -_-'
[23:47:28] <Cork> who is it that isn't reading?
[23:47:44] <djQuery> reading what
[23:47:45] <milligan> hehe
[23:48:28] <iksik> hello
[23:48:45] <Ziber> Cork: can I load a file on a separate domain?
[23:48:58] <Trisox> :)
[23:49:08] <Cork> Ziber: no, you would have to use iframe; proxy it over your domain, or use jsonp
[23:49:14] <iksik> http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/ - is there any better way of doing that? 'click' does not work very well, and i'm not sure if code for hover is a perfect solution either... any one can take a look?
[23:49:41] <Ziber> an iframe... I was considering that.
[23:49:57] <Trisox> iksik: using a * does that ;)
[23:50:13] <Cork> Ziber: its not the best of solutions, and you would still be blocked from accessing it
[23:50:19] <Nebros> good morning. i have a little django / ajax problem. i had     Count: {{ rows_2|length }}    in my page and implement ajax. now the count want work anymore. how can i fix this problem? (the count call is not at the same place like the other with ajax loaded parts. its on the end of the page)
[23:50:28] <Cork> Ziber: but its the only way to load html from a third party site
[23:50:31] <iksik> Trisox: does what? :D
[23:50:35] <Cork> (at least cross domain)
[23:50:42] <Cork> *cross browser
[23:50:51] <Trisox> well it selects verrrrry thing in body
[23:50:57] <Trisox> like css ;)
[23:51:07] <Trisox> heavy on the dom
[23:51:16] <iksik> Trisox: yeah, i know... that is why i've used it ;P
[23:51:16] <Cork> iksik: you ant the user to be able to drag select or something?
[23:51:35] <iksik> Cork: no, i don't want D&D there
[23:51:42] <Cork> what i mean is; what is the problem with the current solution?
[23:51:44] <Trisox> d&D?
[23:51:48] <iksik> just toggleClass on hovered element
[23:51:56] <iksik> Trisox: drag and drop ;P
[23:52:00] <Trisox> ah
[23:52:05] <Cork> ah
[23:52:14] <Cork> iksik: why not just use css?
[23:52:18] <iksik> Cork: hover works weird, and click not always is triggered
[23:52:31] <iksik> hummm
[23:52:36] <simius> almoast thought we had a nerd in the jquery chanel, good save there :P
[23:53:04] <Trisox> haha d&d dungons and dragons ?
[23:53:05] <Trisox> :p
[23:53:10] <Trisox> yea yea ave it
[23:53:14] <iksik> ;-DDDD
[23:53:24] <iksik> i was watching that movie few days ago :P
[23:53:28] <iksik> (again [;)
[23:53:34] <Cork> iksik: http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/1/
[23:53:36] <Trisox> lol witch one
[23:54:00] <Trisox> Cork: he wants not only the p
[23:54:13] <iksik> Cork: change p into * and it would not work :(
[23:54:16] <Trisox> also h1-h6
[23:54:21] <Trisox> i think
[23:54:22] <iksik> yeah, all elements
[23:55:08] <iksik> and click on hovered element, to change it's class into 'bar' - on which hover must not work
[23:55:22] <iksik> hm hm
[23:55:40] <Cork> iksik: http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/2/ ?
[23:56:34] <iksik> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/3/
[23:56:35] <iksik> :P
[23:56:51] <iksik> 'ffOOOO...' :D
[23:57:19] <iksik> hmm, this example of html sucks
[23:57:26] <Trisox> haha iksik
[23:57:35] <Trisox> body * { display: inline; }   makes it bugged
[23:57:38] <Trisox> the inline part
[23:57:44] <Trisox> thats wy the click doesnt work
[23:57:46] <iksik> really? :S
[23:57:50] <Trisox> yea try it
[23:57:57] <Trisox> :D
[23:58:10] <Cork> iksik: http://jsfiddle.net/GWpkw/4/
[23:58:10] <Trisox> and its priceless cause of the comment /* just for better preview of nested elements hover */
[23:58:25] <Cork> iksik: point is; there is little reason to use js for that
[23:58:32] <iksik> Trisox: nope, i still have problems with 'unclicking' it :D
[23:58:33] <Trisox> Cork:  agreed
[23:59:29] <iksik> Cork: point is... i don't know, what html will be used, and i can't use selectors based on class names
[23:59:42] <iksik> :(
