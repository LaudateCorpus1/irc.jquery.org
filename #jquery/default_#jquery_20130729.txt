[00:30:49] <Zerhackos> hi there, i need to modify the height of my fixed toolbar in jquerymobile on click via a button. When the height changes, the content area is then behind the header partly - exactly the height i changed before. Is there a way to reposition the content area properly?
[00:38:03] <lethjakman> is there an easy method to convert a form into json?
[01:02:58] <Zak> hey guys. I'm just wondering how jquery decided to leave IE6,7,8 behind with version 2.0? (How as in, what was the basis of their decision)
[01:03:56] <Zak> is it because IE8 wasn't ECMA5 compliant?
[01:04:53] <Zak> The reason I ask is, according to some stat sites, IE8 is still a fairly dominant browser. So I'm assuming that you would switch between version 1 and version 2, depending on the browser?
[01:05:06] <ravenzz> have you read the announcement post?
[01:05:23] <Zak> ravenzz: this one http://blog.jquery.com/2013/04/18/jquery-2-0-released/ ?
[01:05:25] <ravenzz> Zak if you need to support ie8 you can use 1.10.*
[01:05:40] <dubphil> Hello ! Why with this code : http://jsfiddle.net/HBeza/ I have this error : Uncaught TypeError: Object #container_container_0 p:last has no method 'attr' ?
[01:05:48] <Zak> yeah. I'm just wondering what people are doing to leverage jquery 2.x without leaving IE8 behind
[01:06:23] <ravenzz> I guess any sane dev won't do that
[01:06:33] <ravenzz> if you want to support ie8 go for jQuery 1.10
[01:07:35] <Zak> okay. I haven't got that much experience with jquery. I've been using dojo for a while (for another job). thanks!
[01:08:01] <dubphil> the error is : Uncaught TypeError: Object #container_0 p:last has no method 'attr'
[01:08:09] <ravenzz> Zak from the blog post: "jQuery 2.0 is intended for the modern web; weâ€™ve got jQuery 1.x to handle older browsers and fully expect to support it for several more years. If you want, you can serve 2.0 to newer browsers and 1.9 to older ones using our conditional comment trick, but that is not required. The simplest way to support older browsers is to use jQuery 1.x on your site, since it works
[01:08:09] <ravenzz> for all browsers."
[01:08:28] <Zak> ok thanks
[01:22:27] <fella5s> Is ie8 still a dominant browser? Depends on who you are asking from. if you ask from these guys, they would have to say no: http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php?year=2013&month=06

[02:54:19] <QubeZ> hello all
[02:54:44] <QubeZ> I am trying to get jquery news ticker to work but it still doesn't show up on my webpage. http://www.jquerynewsticker.com
[02:55:27] <QubeZ> I linked the css, imported the script, added the html snippet to my <body> then the script to call the function as well
[02:58:25] <_Jens> QubeZ: any errors/notices in your browser console?
[02:58:59] <QubeZ> nothing, it was erroring on my css but that was because I had css/jquery-style.css instead of just jquery-style.css
[02:59:55] <_Jens> when do you initialize the plugin?
[03:00:19] <QubeZ> http://pastebin.com/BeAv1rVn
[03:01:19] <QubeZ> hmm maybe my jquery-1.8.3.min.js is screwed up, showing up red in the web inspector
[03:01:25] <_Jens> QubeZ: load jQuery before you load the ticker
[03:01:30] <QubeZ> i downloaded it a few times and its all jumbled up text
[03:02:06] <QubeZ> not sure how to download it properly, i just right-click and save the js
[03:02:13] <_Jens> yup
[03:02:55] <_Jens> QubeZ: just to make sure, go here, and just do ctrl+s, and save it to the appropriate folder http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.8.3.min.js
[03:04:14] <_Jens> QubeZ: gotta go for a bit, let me know if you still need help later.
[03:04:20] <QubeZ> hmm keeps saying cannot find
[03:04:21] <QubeZ> thanks
[03:08:28] <sonOfRa> is binding $(this) to a local variable in a function generally a good idea if I access $(this) multiple times? Or will there be unwanted side effects of any sorts?
[03:11:49] <AlexIT> Hello
[03:13:49] <AlexIT> Could anyone help me figure out how I should... parse this I guess to a string that I can insert into a textbox?                  $('#textbox').val(randomvariable+'text');
[03:14:48] <AlexIT> I tried parseString but it doesn't work..
[03:15:16] <mekwall> http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/UzUNT/ ... Why doesn't the Deferred reject when it is 404:ing?
[03:15:47] <AlexIT> Anyone?
[03:25:52] <someone235> AlexIT, what about $('#textbox').html('textHere') ?
[03:26:13] <AlexIT> Hm, I'll try now, thanks!
[03:26:33] <someone235> u r welcome
[03:27:12] <AlexIT> mm...
[03:27:54] <AlexIT> No it still doesn't... fix anything :(
[03:28:23] <AlexIT> Doesn't even execute the code.
[03:29:35] <AlexIT> IT will work fine if I do ('#textbox').val('text1'+'text2');
[03:29:45] <AlexIT> So I think there should be a  way to convert the variable to a string
[03:30:05] <AlexIT> (My logic) can anyone help me on how I might do that?
[03:31:03] <sonOfRa> javascript is not statically typed, what IS your variable?
[03:31:08] <sonOfRa> it might work if you just cram it in there
[03:33:22] <AlexIT> well My variable is inputted by the user, *around 1-10* so var lol1 = $('#textboxthatusermodifies');  ('#textbox').val(lol1+'text');
[03:34:36] <nilliams> var lol1 = $('#textboxthatusermodifies').val();  ('#textbox').val(lol1 + 'text');
[03:35:14] <nilliams> var lol1 = $('#textboxthatusermodifies').val();  $('#textbox').val(lol1 + 'text');
[03:36:46] <AlexIT> yeah problem is it doesnt even execute for me.
[03:38:21] <Anticom> hi all
[03:38:43] <nilliams> AlexIT, Open (Chrome) devtools, use console.log at each step, e.g. var $input =  $('#textboxthatusermodifies'); console.log( $input.length ); var inputText = var lol1 = $('#textboxthatusermodifies').val(); console.log( inputText ); ...
[03:39:03] <Anticom> i'm trying to select a node with the name attribute having the value "foo[bar]". I've tried $('name=[foo[bar]]') but jQuery couldn't interpret that expression
[03:39:05] <Anticom> any ideas?
[03:39:18] <nilliams> Sorry, that 2nd example should just be `var inputText = $('#textboxthatusermodifies').val();`
[03:40:29] <AlexIT> @nilliams yes, it's all written correctly, I quadruple-checked
[03:40:46] <AlexIT> @nilliams following your advice right now.
[03:41:06] <nilliams> console.log is your friend :)
[03:41:24] <AlexIT> @nilliams (learning it right now ^^)
[03:41:39] <nilliams> cool :)
[03:44:34] <AlexIT> @nilliams *Thanks a lot!* apparently its purely my fault for adding an extra 'A' to the variable sorry for bothering you all.. *But still thanks a ton for console.log on chrome*
[03:45:02] <nilliams> AlexIT, no worries!
[03:54:09] <shoky> Anticom:  $('[name="foo[bar]"]')
[03:55:09] <Anticom> thank's shoky ...gave the two nodes IDs now since it's faster anyway. but it's good to know in case of generic checkboxes using that syntax e.g. :)
[03:59:42] <titii> I want to give a click functionality to parent from its child, like: $('.red-button').click(function(){ $(this).children().click(); }), but i have an error: Too much recursion, any idea?
[04:01:41] <shoky> titii: why are you triggering a click? why not just call the function that does what you want?
[04:02:27] <titii> shoky: i dont understand what u mean, can u pastebin an example pls<
[04:02:28] <titii> ?
[04:04:24] <titii> shoky: but my problem is that, i have a wrap of the anchor or input, that is the .red-button. And he is larger than its child, so the anchor or input, And I need to make an alt click, u know what i mean?
[04:07:06] <shoky> titii: you can do event.stopPropagation()  from the child click handler
[04:07:35] <shoky> event being the event argument to the click handler
[04:08:42] <titii> shoky: event in herer func $('.red-button').click(function(){, or here? $(this).children().click(?
[04:08:51] <titii> u mean<
[04:09:11] <yuka> anybody ever used urchin ? i have a very old website where stats are still made with google urchin. does anybody know if its still possible to check those stats somewhere?
[04:09:39] <shoky> titii: http://jsfiddle.net/YHdza/
[04:13:27] <mrHAT> how many .on("click".. can i have and don't expiriance problems with perfoirmance
[04:14:56] <xec_> mrHAT: that depends on a lot of factors, but if you have a lot of them, you should probably have a look at delegation
[04:15:41] <mrHAT> i have about 5
[04:15:55] <mrHAT> 4 on click events and 1 on mouseover
[04:16:32] <nilliams> titii, also this way, which is what shoky suggested initially ("just call the function"), which saves you from firing unnecessary click events: http://jsfiddle.net/YHdza/2/
[04:17:07] <xec_> mouseover is quite different from click, but still - I wouldn't worry if the numbers are that low
[04:17:24] <mrHAT> xec_ :  As of jQuery 1.7, .delegate() has been superseded by the .on() method.
[04:17:27] <mrHAT> heh
[04:17:47] <xec_> mrHAT: yes, you use .on() to create delegates now
[04:17:57] <xec_> it's just a syntax change
[04:18:43] <xec_> mrHAT: the concept is that you have a single click handler on a parent rather than many on each child you want clickable
[04:18:52] <mrHAT> somebody in #javascript recommended on() on the parent of the elements in question but how do i know which has gained click event ?
[04:19:54] <titii> nilliams, shoky: pls, check this http://jsfiddle.net/YHdza/3/, updated my selectors, is it ok?
[04:19:55] <xec_> mrHAT: read the docs, particularly (sp?) this part: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[04:20:37] <mrHAT> xec_ i understand that but you didnt understood my question
[04:21:01] <xec_> mrHAT: ok, could you rephrase in that case?
[04:21:29] <mrHAT> i have : button1 , button2, button3, ... button 1 has to trigger something and 1, 2 something elese
[04:21:49] <xec_> you mean 2 & 3 i assume?
[04:22:14] <mrHAT> i currently set a class for each button action and check that with hasClass === action ?
[04:22:29] <mrHAT> hmmm .. let me pastebin that
[04:22:33] <xec_> mrHAT: with so few click handlers i wouldn't worry
[04:22:49] <xec_> mrHAT: i'm talking about if you had hundreds of click handlers
[04:23:44] <mrHAT> http://jsbin.com/ojuvuq/1
[04:23:45] <mrHAT> check
[04:24:09] <mrHAT> is this a good way to do it ?
[04:24:50] <xec_> mrHAT: that would work, sure - but i would have separate handlers
[04:25:04] <xec_> you're already using the delegate syntax
[04:25:17] <mrHAT> what do you mean by separate handlers ?
[04:25:38] <xec_> for three buttons i would have three .on("click"...
[04:26:04] <xec_> or rather, .click()
[04:26:12] <mrHAT> but you just said earlier to delegate on the parent container
[04:26:20] <nilliams> titii, sure (assuming you make it match the html!), although $('.red-button').children().click( ... )  is a little (1) messy and (2) brittle. If you changed the DOM that is likely to break (like if you ever put another element type as a child to "red-button", say an icon). You could do $('.red-button').children('.child').click( ... ). But I'd recommend just using specific classes on the children and jus
[04:26:20] <nilliams> t bind to those like $(".child-item").click(..)
[04:26:22] <xec_> if you have a lot of click handlers, sure
[04:26:26] <mrHAT> hmm
[04:26:27] <mrHAT> ok
[04:26:36] <xec_> mrHAT: if you only have three, don't worry about it
[04:26:39] <mrHAT> so for 3 - 4 it's nothing
[04:26:49] <xec_> exactly
[04:27:03] <gprr> how to make ajax get data with different callback not using the standard request?
[04:27:35] <xec_> gprr: i read that question five times, and it makes less and less sense to me :D
[04:28:04] <xec_> you want multiple callbacks on the same request?
[04:29:07] <gprr> i need to use existing websocket not the open(), send() way
[04:29:41] <xec_> websocket != ajax
[04:30:15] <titii> nilliams: but still it is wrong, i changed console.log( 'child clicked', $child ); into $child.click(); and there is an error too much recursion
[04:30:51] <gprr> xec_ its just another way to load data, it can be read from a local file?
[04:31:11] <nilliams> titii, with the example I gave you, there is no need to call $child.click
[04:31:54] <xec_> ?xy @ gprr
[04:32:12] <nilliams> titii, Open the console and see that if you click either the parent or the child the onChildClicked gets called, which is what you want no?
[04:32:39] <xec_> gprr: silly bot isn't here, and i'm confused about what you're really asking about
[04:33:02] <xec_> gprr: what are you trying to do? what's the use case?
[04:33:18] <titii> nilliams: sure it is the right child that i want, but now i want to click him, this should simulare click the parents child click, the input or anchor
[04:33:35] <gprr> converting existing ajax scripts to use websockets
[04:33:42] <titii> nilliams: u know what i need?
[04:38:11] <titii> nilliams: but all the way it looks wrong :) i have three buttons bellowe, and whan i click on firt, the third is proccessed :D
[04:38:52] <nilliams> titii, you have the parent 'red-button`, and three child buttons?
[04:39:30] <nilliams> ... and clicking the parent should do the same as clicking all the child buttons?
[04:41:09] <titii> nilliams: no exactly, i have three buttons like <div class=red-button..><a href..></div> <div class=red-button..><input submit...</div><div class=red-button..><a href..></div>, and click the parent red-button should click its child, so 1. anchor, or 2. input
[04:43:51] <titii> nilliams: and this script is wong, because when i click on first parent, there is no effect, and when i click on first, but input, the last input - button is proccessed :)
[04:45:42] <nilliams> when you say 'should click its child' do you actually mean that, in the case where the child is an anchor, you want to follow the link? i.e. go to its href? And in the input case? Just focus it?
[04:45:47] <nilliams> titii, ^
[04:47:14] <titii> nilliams: the first sentense of the anchor u r right, and the input, just press it, or submit
[04:48:05] <titii> nilliams: its easy, i have wrap=red-button, and child anchor or input, when i click on a wrap i need to click its child
[04:50:18] <nilliams> titii, well then shoky's original example will do that: http://jsfiddle.net/YHdza/1/  except clicking an input will not make it "submit"!
[04:51:21] <nilliams> or do you mean input type="submit", sorry!
[04:51:26] <nilliams> I so rarely use those :)
[04:51:33] <titii> nilliams: why not? how to do that? i need input too
[04:52:04] <titii> yea input type submit
[04:52:36] <titii> but  maybe i woud be originally, anything as a child should be "clicked"
[04:52:45] <titii> nilliams: dont know if this is possible
[04:52:48] <ryorky1> what would be the shorthand way of writing this?
[04:52:50] <ryorky1>       if (($('.uploadtemplate').length == 0)){$(data.context).insertAfter(clickparentid.closest('tr'));}else{$(data.context).insertAfter('.uploadtemplate:last').last();}
[04:52:58] <nilliams> yeah shoky's example will work for that!
[04:53:03] <nilliams> http://jsfiddle.net/YHdza/1/
[04:55:01] <nilliams> titii, sorry for taking you on a detour, I didn't realise you were actually doing 'clicks' to do full page reloads (like submit or following a link).
[04:55:22] <titii> nilliams: maybe u didnt believe me, but there is still that wrong, like i said... i click first button, and the last is preccessed, dont know why
[04:56:36] <nilliams> titii, is this when you click on a button containing <input type="submit"> or containing the anchor?
[04:56:48] <titii> nilliams: yes, but that click also works with ajax :) so everything i need is to simlate click its child
[04:57:08] <titii> nilliams: submit
[04:57:17] <shoky> ryorky1: var ut = $('.uploadtemplate'), insertAfter = ut.length ? ut.last() : clickparentid.closest('tr'); $(data.context).insertAfter(insertAfter);    not much shorter
[04:57:17] <nilliams> titii, and do you have more than one submit?
[04:57:49] <titii> nilliams: yes,. i have 1. submit, 2. anchor, 3. anchor, 4 submit
[04:58:03] <nilliams> titii, have you made sure each submit is within it's own <form>?
[04:58:08] <titii> when i click 1. the 4th is proccessed
[04:58:33] <titii> nilliams: yes, when stop this script, and click on eachm its is correct
[05:00:30] <nilliams> titii, hmm I can't see how each submit could be in it's own form else .children() would not find the submit... (as the <form> would be somewhere between the 'red button' and the submit)
[05:01:11] <titii> nilliams: form is outer wrap of these all
[05:02:09] <nilliams> titii, so all submits will submit the same form... what are you expecting to happen differently depending on each submit being clicked?
[05:02:55] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone assist here please: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17838078/how-to-send-my-form-data-to-my-post-script-uploadify
[05:03:53] <titii> nilliams: yes the same form, but in php script i have an condition to know, what submit was clicked :)
[05:06:17] <fRAiLtY-> Code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/n4t3j/ Just want to pass the token var and the form field vars with the $.post request to oncomplete.php
[05:07:48] <titii>   nilliams: this is wrong, event.stopPropagation();, when i comment it out, the submitting works
[05:10:40] <titii> nilliams: but without this i have mooooooooore recursive there, hmmm
[05:11:34] <titii> nilliams: I didnt expected it so sofisticated
[05:11:46] <cody--> fRAiLtY- is uploadifive() something you've made?
[05:12:15] <titii> i mean fold
[05:16:56] <nilliams> titii, yes, that event.stopPropagation() is there to stop the event from the *child* 'bubbling up' to the parent and then triggering the parent's click handler as well... causing recursion
[05:19:20] <nilliams> titii, you're right, it should not be hard, shoky's code should work as far as I can tell. Not sure I can help much more without the code infront of me sorry. You could try and put your code in a jsfiddle and maybe someone can jump in and help. I have to go soon :/
[05:19:46] <fRAiLtY-> cody-- No it's a pre-built uploader, it works fine just trying to use $.post to send some extra stuff to a separate file
[05:19:59] <titii> nilliams: i cant understand it, check this http://jsfiddle.net/YHdza/4/.... the console.log write the right element!!! but the submission is somewhere elsee, becase i get the proccessing of the last submit button
[05:20:52] <titii> nilliams: ok, thank u all the way
[05:22:38] <ravenzz> titii can you repeat your question=
[05:22:39] <ravenzz> ?
[05:24:17] <titii> ravenzz: when u see the javascript, the consol.log show me right child element of the .red-button, but proccess of click is wrong, still the last button is pressed, because php script shows it
[05:25:01] <titii> ravenzz: dont know why
[05:25:04] <ravenzz> titii sorry I just joined the conversation, what are you taking about?
[05:25:13] <mrHAT> ok, so i have this: <td> <div> <a>how do i get value of #test from here </a> </div>  <input id="test" /> </td>
[05:25:40] <mrHAT> should i first climb up to td and then find #test ?
[05:25:59] <titii> ravenzz: i have a buttons this is wrap, and anchor, or input submit in here, when i press the wrap, i need to press its child
[05:26:09] <ravenzz> mrHAT yeah or .parent().next('#test')
[05:26:35] <mrHAT> parent of <a> would be <div> in my example
[05:26:39] <mrHAT> that won't work
[05:26:39] <titii> ravenzz: red-button is button's wrapper
[05:26:48] <ravenzz> why not?
[05:27:07] <mrHAT> what happens if i'm deeper then 4 levels... ?
[05:27:15] <nilliams> titii, i'm still suspicious of the 'multiple submits in a single form', it's possible that calling .click() on any of your submits calls .submit() on the parent <form>, which just will include the name of the *last button in the form* in the actual submit to the server.
[05:27:16] <ravenzz> you didn't mention that
[05:27:20] <mrHAT> or 5 - 10 levels deep
[05:27:22] <nilliams> maybe someone else can jump in on that theory
[05:27:40] <mrHAT> ravenzz ok, so how do you traverse in that case ?
[05:27:41] <ravenzz> nilliams the 1st usually
[05:27:50] <nilliams> hmm
[05:27:53] <ravenzz> mrHAT closest('td').find()
[05:28:25] <ravenzz> nilliams at least in html its like that
[05:28:37] <mrHAT> how fast is that ?
[05:29:04] <ravenzz> mrHAT I don't know, you could set up a test on jsperf
[05:29:17] <ravenzz> but it seems to be the best choice
[05:29:18] <ravenzz> to me
[05:30:07] <mrHAT> what does it do in this case ? does it starts traversing starting from top root <html> or does it climbs to the nearest td ?
[05:30:27] <ravenzz> the latter
[05:30:30] <mrHAT> starting from the current..
[05:30:32] <mrHAT> hmm
[05:30:35] <ravenzz> I guess it uses parentNode
[05:31:05] <ravenzz> but I could be wrong, you should check the jQuery soruce code
[05:31:09] <mrHAT> i guess it's faster then doing parent().parent()....
[05:32:02] <mrHAT> i usually don't tend to micro-optimize js but this needs to consume as little as possible
[05:32:09] <ravenzz> i think it isn't, but it is more flexible, I mean using closest() you don't need to know what is you html like
[05:32:19] <mrHAT> yeah
[05:34:17] <Croves> Why this is not working? $(this).find('form').reset(); o0
[05:34:27] <nilliams> titii, this works fine for me: http://pastebin.com/9jCKejUK
[05:34:28] <Croves> Firebug says: "TypeError: $(...).find(...).reset is not a function"
[05:36:04] <xec_> .get().reset()
[05:36:32] <titii> nilliams: thank u man, i am goin to check it
[05:37:00] <xec_> Croves: reset is a method on forms in the dom, not a jquery method
[05:37:14] <nilliams> titii, no probs, was a good reminder for me of form submitting heh, I'm about to apply for some crappy PHP jobs :)
[05:37:20] <xec_> Croves: .get() or [0] would return the native dom element
[05:37:22] <ravenzz> there no reset()
[05:37:28] <Croves> xec_ Oh, right...
[05:37:40] <Croves> So, $(this).get('form').reset(); ?
[05:37:49] <ravenzz> Croves $(this).find('form').trigger('reset')
[05:37:52] <xec_> $("form").get().reset()
[05:38:35] <xec_> actually, .get(0)
[05:38:46] <spobat> is there a more 'dynamic' event than 'click'?
[05:39:03] <spobat> The issue is that you can't select the element by tabs + ENTER this way
[05:39:11] <ravenzz> Croves anyway you should always put a reset input in your forms
[05:39:33] <ravenzz> you can always put it away from the screen with CSS
[05:39:43] <Croves> ravenzz in this case, I'm using a modal to display a form. If the user add some data to this form and close the modal, the next time he open it, the data will still be there
[05:39:59] <Croves> I need to get this data away when the modal is hidden
[05:41:09] <xec_> ravenzz: reset is a method, not just an event https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement.reset
[05:41:27] <titii> nilliams: :)) but u are right, this seems to be working well, maybe really i will some prob in my server script. I cant tell it exactly because i am using Nette framework and here is some method to get the clicked submit. Problem seems somewhere beetween, TY i am goin to inspect :)
[05:41:53] <nilliams> titii, cool, good luck :)
[05:42:03] <Krisostoomus> hello. im making cross-domain ajax post query, and im getting just "error". how can i get more specific information? http://djrankings.org/soundcloudproject/sharesoundjquery.php

[05:43:08] <noregret> anybody uses fineuploader? any idea if I can select a file to upload prgrammatically?
[05:44:52] <ravenzz> xec_ oh yeah
[05:47:32] <xec_> noregret: for security reasons you can't access the local filesystem, so i doubt you can
[05:49:16] <noregret> you're right, hhmm
[05:51:18] <fRAiLtY-> Can anyone assist here please: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17838078/how-to-send-my-form-data-to-my-post-script-uploadify
[05:51:49] <fRAiLtY-> Code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/n4t3j/ Just want to pass the token var and the form field vars with the $.post request to oncomplete.php
[06:01:32] <mrHAT> $(this).val().toFixed(2) returns toFixed is not a function? why ?
[06:01:48] <mrHAT> ahh damn ..
[06:01:55] <mrHAT> val is a string
[06:02:02] <mrHAT> i should parseInt that
[06:17:17] <nilliams> fRAiLtY, this will do it, though it will submit as an array (I'm not a big fan of serializeArray): var postData = $("#upload-form form").serializeArray(); postData.push({ token: token }); $.post( 'oncomplete.php', postData );
[06:25:14] <themojowill> afternoon
[06:43:46] <themojowill> anyone alive in here?
[06:46:25] <lord4163> themojowill: lil bit :P
[06:47:22] <themojowill> i have lots of dropdowns, user selects A, B, C etc, if user goes back and changes dropdown A I want B and C to clear their selections is this possible?
[06:47:42] <themojowill> like wise if he changes B, C clears but A stays selected
[06:51:06] <dblosevn> Hey, maybe im trying to overthink this but I want to bind to jqms pagebeforeload event and run a few async tasks before letting it load the next page im having issues in a phone gap app that the page is shown before all callbacks have been completed and the page renders funny and im trying to process all the callbacks before letting jqm load pages
[06:54:39] <dblosevn> about half a second after the page is shown all my callbacks comeplete and the text and images are injected into the page so the layout is broken when its first shown then fixes it self after about 500ms
[06:59:35] <ryorky1> I have the following function and call, but the code in the function always runs. Here is a fiddle:  http://jsfiddle.net/hetvC/
[07:02:08] <ryorky1> Cork:  any ideas?
[07:03:04] <ryorky1> http://jsfiddle.net/hetvC/1/
[07:05:00] <dblosevn> ryorky1: it doesnt apear you set the var parentexpanderlen at all inside addfolderexpander so it would prolly always eval true
[07:06:38] <ryorky1> dbosevn:  left out a line  http://jsfiddle.net/hetvC/2/
[07:06:51] <ryorky1> any other ideas?
[07:07:27] <Mikou> hi, why is my bind events not working on li.items ? cf : http://jsfiddle.net/nSDXE/2/
[07:08:19] <dblosevn> ryorky1: are you sure the plugin is adding data attribs? I have had that issue before when the plugin uses .data to add the data it doesnt create the attribs and just stores the info in the dom
[07:08:43] <Mikou> It works only if my selector is an ID.
[07:09:18] <shoky> Mikou:  > means direct children.  li.item is not the direct child of #wrapper
[07:09:26] <iredmedia> http://jsfiddle.net/iredmedia/nSDXE/4/
[07:09:29] <iredmedia> try that
[07:10:24] <Mikou> shoky : thanks.
[07:12:09] <iredmedia> http://jsfiddle.net/iredmedia/nSDXE/4/
[07:12:21] <iredmedia> if you didn't get my message before, thats the solution to your 'binding' issue.
[07:12:27] <ryorky1> dblosevn:  I'm not adding the data attributes, just referencing them.  Can I just return the parentexpanderlen and set it to be greater than 1?
[07:13:27] <dblosevn> Mikou: http://jsfiddle.net/tR32b/ works fine without an id
[07:13:49] <iredmedia> The issue was > means 'direct child'. Your UL is the direct child of #wrapper. Thus, your query was not selecting anything.
[07:14:07] <dblosevn> ryorky1: Can you show me an example so I can see the generated src
[07:15:49] <iredmedia> In code, always check values from left to right. Ensure the parent object (or caller) exists. JQuery can bind to nothing without an error, because $() is valid (console.log($());)
[07:17:30] <themojowill> how can I clear all dropdowns after the one that is being changed? This is kinda what I'm doing https://gist.github.com/mojowill/6104600
[07:18:35] <nilliams> themojowill, you are using the select2 plugin? you should probably make that clear
[07:18:48] <themojowill> yeah sorry I am using select2
[07:21:05] <BillCriswell> themojowill: I believe you want .nextAll('select').select2clearorwhatever()
[07:30:30] <bloomberg> Morning guys!!
[07:30:31] <bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/aviben/1/edit
[07:30:37] <bloomberg> http://www.jtable.org/demo/filtering
[07:30:51] <bloomberg> }I'm trying to do this filtering and I can't get it
[07:30:56] <bloomberg> someone could help me with this
[07:31:09] <bloomberg> the filtering of my script doesn't works
[07:32:50] <themojowill> BillCriswell, $(this).nextAll('select').select2( 'data', null);?
[07:34:04] <nilliams> themojowill, you might want to consider something that's not *quite* so DOM dependent, i.e. nextAll() relies on you always having those selects as siblings. You could do something like this, which is slightly more robust: http://jsfiddle.net/a97tZ/1/
[07:34:48] <nilliams> obviously using whatever select2's clearing thing is
[07:35:11] <lduros> I have a jquery object for the first input id="input1" in <tr> <td><input id="input1"/></td><td><input id="input2"/></td> I'm trying to get to the <input> inside the td right next to it (id is input2). What is the best way to get to it, aside from using the id of course
[07:35:44] <lduros> i tried to do a $input.parent('td').parent('tr').last('td').children('input') but this sounds a bit lengthy
[07:36:03] <lduros> besides i'm not sure if I'm going to add another td to the table
[07:37:38] <nilliams> parent("td").next().children("input")
[07:38:04] <nilliams> DOM traversal like that is icky though, usually want to take a step back and think about what you're trying to do!
[07:40:07] <nilliams> lduros, ^
[07:40:20] <lduros> heh,
[07:40:21] <themojowill> nilliams, your examples relies on adding a data-order parameter to the element yes?
[07:40:23] <lduros> I figured it out
[07:40:42] <lduros> nilliams: $input.parent('td').next().children('input'); does the trick
[07:40:42] <nilliams> themojowill, yep
[07:40:58] <themojowill> is there a way of doing it without that?
[07:40:59] <BillCriswell> themojowill: Yes.  That would get all the sibling <selects> after the one that changed.
[07:41:29] <bloomberg> BillCriswell: can do you help me with my script plz
[07:41:38] <bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/aviben/1/edit
[07:41:43] <bloomberg> http://www.jtable.org/demo/filtering
[07:42:12] <BillCriswell> bloomberg: Sorry, pretty busy today.
[07:42:24] <bloomberg> Ok, thank you
[07:43:46] <BillCriswell> bloomberg: Quick tip looking at it through. Don't end objects with an extra ,. It'll break IE. ie: { name: 'Bill', channel: 'jquery', }
[07:43:58] <nilliams> themojowill, well it depends. If you were injecting the selects into the DOM on the client, you could keep *actual* element references, so then you wouldn't need the data-attributes. But I suspect you're not doing that, you're progressively enhancing static html selects?
[07:44:45] <themojowill> nilliams, yeah, dropdowns are populated based on selection in previous dropdown, if user goes back a step I need to clear the following dropdowns to avoid the wrong records being slected
[07:45:13] <themojowill> select2 is enhancing the standard select elements to make them all fancy
[07:45:49] <bloomberg> Ok man, thank you
[07:45:53] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[07:47:58] <nilliams> sure, the data-attributes are a *simple* compromise to keep it slighly more robust than nextAll(). If you wanted to *really* do it properly, you'd want to consider generating/re-rendering the selects in JS (i.e. using an HTML template) and keep references to all selects in JavaScript, but that's quite a bit more involved.
[07:50:13] <nilliams> (i.e. Backbone.js-like thinking, when one select changes, re-render the *views* for all 3 selects.) But if all you want is a bit of jQuery sprinkling over an otherwise static page, I would go with nextAll() or the data-attributes approach.
[07:50:30] <nilliams> themojowill, ^
[07:50:30] <themojowill> i think my dom tree isn't quite right as siblings and nextall dont really do anything
[07:50:43] <nilliams> ah :)
[07:51:44] <BillCriswell> They all have to have the same immediate parent to be siblings.
[07:51:54] <BillCriswell> Wow that's a very logical way to explain it.
[07:52:02] <BillCriswell> I usually complicate shit like crazy.
[07:52:05] <BillCriswell> I'm learning wo hoooo
[08:00:37] <qkzoo> I have an anchor, which when clicked, reveals a hidden form.  I bound the toggling of the form display to a click event, but am curious, should I have trapped other events, too, like mousedown?? others?
[08:03:53] <smooki> hi
[08:04:03] <smooki> select2 docs are really poor no ?
[08:04:12] <smooki> it says to look at $.fn.select2.defaults but how ?
[08:04:20] <nilliams> qkzoo, it's pretty rare you need to bind to other events, click is typically enough.
[08:04:42] <nilliams> smooki, try typing it into your console!
[08:04:43] <BillCriswell> smooki: You can type that right into your console of a page tht has it loaded.
[08:04:47] <nilliams> :)
[08:05:03] <smooki> ok
[08:05:18] <smooki> because the selectbox are not well displayed ...
[08:05:22] <smooki> I'll lost with it
[08:05:49] <qkzoo> Good to know, its a mobile app, and my mouse clicks on desktop and mobile are both registered as clicks, but I wanted to check :)
[08:06:43] <smooki> so I would be able to use select2 are regulars selectox as well ?
[08:08:26] <nilliams> qkzoo, well there is a bit more to mobile if you want it to feel snappier, as on iOS you get a 0.3 second delay on 'click' events
[08:09:32] <smooki> how to style forms guys ?
[08:09:46] <slax0r> with css
[08:10:05] <smooki> never found how to style well selectbox & options i.e
[08:10:18] <SargoDarya> smooki: Those aren't stylable that easy
[08:10:27] <slax0r> you can't do much with standard CSS
[08:10:32] <slax0r> as well as checkboxes and radios
[08:10:34] <smooki> that's why I ask :)
[08:10:36] <SargoDarya> you may want to write your own selectbox or option component
[08:10:41] <slax0r> google up a bit on styling those
[08:10:49] <slax0r> people written some nice plugins that handle that
[08:10:52] <slax0r> quite easy to use
[08:10:59] <smooki> if you have any good example ...
[08:11:24] <slax0r> http://line25.com/articles/jquery-plugins-for-styling-checkbox-radio-buttons
[08:11:29] <slax0r> I have a list
[08:11:43] <smooki> nice one
[08:11:57] <smooki> if you a the same for selectbox/options I would be thankfull
[08:12:24] <slax0r> at least go through the list...they are there :)
[08:12:38] <SargoDarya> smooki: google is your friend. We already guided you in the direction.
[08:13:22] <smooki> ok thanks
[08:14:43] <SargoDarya> How I like sample images: http://speckycdn.sdm.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/css_ui_kit_10.jpg
[08:15:38] <SargoDarya> I wonder what he thought when using that background color. "Well, let's use a more eye popping color." *bright light shines into his eyes* "YEEEEEEEEEES!!!111"
[08:16:16] <McEasy> That's a morning wakeup background o.0
[08:18:08] <themojowill> nilliams, went down the data order route and working now thanks
[08:18:36] <nilliams> themojowill, cool, no probs! :)
[08:20:47] <DarkGhost> Hello everyone
[08:21:59] <DarkGhost> http://beta.truedelta.com/Jeep-Wrangler/problems-146 if you click Contact this vehicle owner, it opens up a dialog ui, I have draggable enabled, but for some reason the dialog isnt draggable only the textarea inside.. any ideas?
[08:25:34] <DarkGhost> I'm getting Eror: TypeError: expr.replace is not a function
[08:26:14] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: .replace is for strings.
[08:27:23] <DarkGhost> BillCriswell I'm not using it, thats jsut the error I'm getting when I try dragging it.
[08:27:25] <DarkGhost> give it a try?
[08:30:51] <BillCriswell> You have jQuery included twice.
[08:31:07] <nilliams> try getting rid of the draggable call before .dialog(), you're currently doing `.draggable().dialog( ... )`
[08:31:46] <DarkGhost> BillCriswell I know, I didn't design the website and it is poorly done but I can't redo anything. that 1.5.2 jquery gets included on every page
[08:31:53] <DarkGhost> but I don't think thats the problem
[08:32:01] <DarkGhost> nilliams, I did try that before, no luck. I'll change it for you right now though.
[08:32:23] <DarkGhost> for soem reason the textarea is moveable.
[08:33:06] <DarkGhost> ugh this is going to btoher me for so long
[08:34:48] <nilliams> and get rid of the draggable at the end, you now have .dialog( ... ).draggable();
[08:34:57] <nilliams> DarkGhost, ^
[08:35:13] <DarkGhost> yeah, isnt there suppose to be a draggable somewhere?
[08:35:26] <nilliams> no you don't need it, dialog is draggable by default
[08:35:34] <DarkGhost> okay, well I removed it
[08:35:36] <nilliams> and if you want to disable it you set it in the dialog options
[08:36:10] <DarkGhost> okay, I enabled it.. nothing is draggable
[08:36:22] <Zerhackos> is there a way to reuse the JQM transitions e.g fade somehow?
[08:45:11] <nilliams> DarkGhost, a JS exception is being thrown when you try to click the dialog to drag it.
[08:45:35] <nilliams> I am struggling to trace it back, it's pretty majorly broken.
[08:45:57] <bloomberg> someone know how can I get this eefct, when I mouse over on a image show me invisible that options
[08:46:01] <bloomberg> http://www.unheap.com/section/media/dialogs-lightboxes/
[08:46:06] <bloomberg> effect*
[08:46:29] <DarkGhost> nilliams haha, pretty majorly broken. I agree.. do you htink its because 2 jquery files are being included such as BillCriswell said?
[08:47:21] <nilliams> DarkGhost, probably not helping as in my experience jQueryUI is pretty fussy about which version of jQuery you use it with.
[08:48:05] <nilliams> DarkGhost, also the use of $().load followed by .dialog() is wrong
[08:48:36] <nilliams> you probably want to call $().dialog() in the `complete` callback for $().load()
[08:50:22] <DarkGhost> okay, I'll look into that in one second.. what is the difference between putting code at bottom of page / top?
[08:50:46] <nilliams> var $dialog = $("#dialog");  $dialog.load("/inc/contact_member.php" + $(this).attr('href'), function() { $dialog.dialog({ .. }) });
[08:51:34] <nilliams> DarkGhost, if you put it at the top (in the head) you have to wait for 'DOM ready', i.e. $(document).ready(function() { ... your code here ... });
[08:51:43] <nilliams> if you put it at the bottom, right before </body> there's no need
[08:52:55] <nilliams> That's me for tonight, good luck!
[08:52:57] <DarkGhost> hmm weird, I got it. but okay let me do the dialog on the complete.
[08:57:29] <DarkGhost> BillCriswell around for one quick moment?
[08:57:55] <BillCriswell> A little busy, but what's up?
[08:59:22] <DarkGhost> sorry, just a quick question: http://beta.truedelta.com/Jeep-Wrangler/ any idea why when you load the dialog by lcicking on the link.. and than try to drag it.. its not dragging from the right positions
[09:04:27] <BillCriswell> That page isn't loading anything for me.
[09:04:53] <BillCriswell> Well, not displaying anything.
[09:05:10] <BillCriswell> Only seems to load to like 65.
[09:05:14] <BillCriswell> 45* even
[09:05:48] <sunblind> im in need of some assistance since im a total novice when it comes to coding websites

[09:11:26] <DarkGhost> err sorry BillCriswell : http://beta.truedelta.com/Jeep-Wrangler/problems-146
[09:12:21] <BillCriswell> Seems to be working here.
[09:12:35] <DarkGhost> your mosue cursor doesn't jump up like 10 ft?
[09:12:43] <BillCriswell> Nope.
[09:13:09] <khmer> es?
[09:13:13] <DarkGhost> sunblind: http://jsfiddle.net/pqhuU/
[09:13:56] <sunblind> thanks DarkGhost
[09:14:15] <DarkGhost> ok BillCriswell in the next case, http://privatepaste.com/f3953c0a07 does that seem about right?
[09:14:20] <DarkGhost> sunblind: now what exatly do you want to do with it
[09:14:59] <sunblind> well fill it with text and some image, but i cant seem to grasp how to make the text under "page one" any smaller
[09:15:11] <sunblind> forgive my incompetence
[09:15:28] <DarkGhost> this is more of a question for #html or #css sunblind
[09:15:51] <DarkGhost> but if you put the tags <span style='font-size:1em;'></span> around that text  it will make itsmaller
[09:16:10] <DarkGhost> or just edit #one and add a font-size in there
[09:16:25] <sunblind> allright
[09:16:58] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: Seems ok to me assuming 'this' is what you think it is.
[09:17:16] <DarkGhost> well, when you click the "Send" button on that dialog I want it to submit that.
[09:17:23] <DarkGhost> but it doesn't sem to be returning any data.

[09:52:19] <abby_m> hello - how do I add the change handler to a dynamically added field (shows up after the dom has been loaded)
[09:52:23] <abby_m> ?

[09:58:04] <DarkGhost> for some reason when I go to drag my dialog just clicking the title pushes it down about 500px... any idea why? not in chrome though.
[09:58:17] <qkzoo1978> Can somebody reference me a link to dynamically injecting javascript (code, not markup) using jquery mobile?
[09:58:46] <qkzoo1978> is it even possible?
[10:01:42] <BillCriswell> qkzoo1978: $.getScript should be able to handle it?
[10:01:47] <BillCriswell> I think I need a sandwich.
[10:02:50] <qkzoo1978> I dunno, I'll take a look, thank you.  I've seen lots of examples of injecting markup, but not code :o
[10:07:06] <AndChat|385209> I dunno, I'll take a look, thank you.  I've seen lots of examples of injecting markup, but not code :o
[10:07:30] <LostJQDev> Hello -- is there a way for the datepicker to show time as well? Or is there another object I can use for date/time?
[10:08:29] <AndChat|385209> .getscript loads an external page, i need to dynamically insert new jscript code.
[10:13:43] <abby_m> thank you Saaether_
[10:18:57] <DarkGhost> does anyone know a solution to this prtoblem? http://jsfiddle.net/tj_vantoll/7sU9L/ (click launch) butto
[10:21:42] <rutinerad> DarkGhost: what's the problem?
[10:21:49] <DarkGhost> you have ot be in FF to see it
[10:22:02] <DarkGhost> once you drag
[10:22:05] <DarkGhost> it jumps down abou 500px
[10:23:06] <petey> if i have both pure JS and jquery on a page, do i want to call both window.onload and $(document).ready?
[10:23:11] <petey> how do i handle that situation?
[10:23:21] <rutinerad> not for me, the popup is in the middle of the Result section and when i drag it it works as expected
[10:24:52] <DarkGhost> really?
[10:25:02] <rutinerad> yup, in both chrome and firefox
[10:25:12] <DarkGhost> thats very weird
[10:25:23] <DarkGhost> http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/6258
[10:26:08] <dblosevn> hey im really trying to understand how deferreds work, and i have a question
[10:27:56] <dblosevn> I want to attach a deffred to the jqm event pageload but im stuck i dont want the rest of the events to fire until im ready
[10:28:00] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: What browser are you experiencing this on?
[10:28:03] <DarkGhost> firefox
[10:28:08] <DarkGhost> beta 9
[10:28:16] <DarkGhost> i mean
[10:28:17] <DarkGhost> 23
[10:28:40] <Saaether_> ya im getting the same issue in firefox for your page
[10:28:51] <DarkGhost> :(
[10:29:13] <DarkGhost> very disappointing
[10:29:26] <DarkGhost> any idea why?
[10:29:37] <DarkGhost> probably the bad css but idk how to fix that
[10:36:39] <DarkGhost> Moving on: http://privatepaste.com/c18dfa4657 how come that $.post doesn't return any data?
[10:36:44] <DarkGhost> is it not getting sent since its inside the button?
[10:37:20] <BillCriswell> DarkGhost: What do you expect this to be inside that function?
[10:38:00] <DarkGhost> ohhh..
[10:38:08] <DarkGhost> you asked that same question before and I totally misread the context.
[10:38:48] <BillCriswell> i could definitely use some work on my specificity.
[10:39:06] <DarkGhost> okay then
[10:39:07] <DarkGhost> it worked
[10:39:21] <DarkGhost> thank you BillCriswell
[10:39:24] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[10:45:00] <hussan> hi
[10:46:03] <Barelds> hi
[10:47:03] <hussan> any jquerymobile?
[10:50:38] <ryanneufeld> ?ask @ hussan
[10:50:38] <b-ot> hussan: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:50:46] <hussan> ok
[10:51:00] <hussan> i ask before nobody answer me
[10:52:22] <hussan> i have a page cat.html and i have a link to go to store.html
[10:52:35] <hussan> is ok, but when try back i dont have the data in listview
[10:56:44] <hussan> ok
[11:02:27] <astropriate> Are there any good/clean themes for jquery UI that don't scream "I was made in 2005"?
[11:03:04] <astropriate> I know I can make my own, was wondering if there was like a gallery or something. I can pay for it
[11:03:33] <Croves> Hey guys, I get this json response from my PHP script: ["[27,29]", "[100.00,288.72]"]. I need to get the first part ([27,29]) and pass it to my highchart plugin to generate my chartâ€¦ but it's not working
[11:03:58] <Croves> instead of the highchart recognize this first part as a group of parameters, it recognize as a string...
[11:04:13] <gho5t> JSON.Parse
[11:04:17] <snover> thatâ€™s because it is a string
[11:06:59] <Croves> What should I do to parse it as a array?
[11:08:58] <Croves> Ok, I get it...
[11:09:03] <Croves> The problem was on my PHP script :P
[11:10:35] <wh0ami> hi
[11:11:24] <wh0ami> i've got a <select> menu and inside <option>, option tags have got data-class
[11:11:40] <wh0ami> how can i get the value of the selected option data-class?
[11:12:23] <hussan> any?
[11:13:14] <wh0ami> asd
[11:17:40] <McEasy> So I'm working with this progress bar located at http://jqueryui.com/progressbar/#label but need to change it into an event driven progress bar. Currently this demo uses a timeout call that just calls "progress" in a specified time. I want it to be changed to updating when an action is completed. Any ideas as to go about doing this?
[11:19:15] <McEasy> my best guess right now is to call "progress" with a parameter when an event is complete. Then the progress function would have a switch statement checking what event was just finished and update accordingly. Would this idea work?
[11:26:15] <McEasy> It seems like this progress bar is useful only for number based progress.. maybe I should look somewhere else?
[11:26:48] <NoiseEee> McEasy: what is progress if not a number / evaluation?
[11:27:36] <McEasy> Er yeah, it is a number. My thoughts made more sense than what I typed.
[11:28:08] <McEasy> I meant it could easily display a number, but not variable text.
[11:29:42] <McEasy> ie.. you have 3 events. each take up 33.33% split evenly. The first event causes the progress bar to display "working on part a". Then the next event would set the progress bar +33.33 and change the text to "working on part b". So on and so forth.
[11:30:18] <McEasy> Can I add an input to the change function so it can display each event correctly? or is there another way?
[11:31:39] <bray9082> can Jquery lightbox be interactive
[11:32:08] <bray9082> like if i put a picture in Lightbox can i put a link inside that picture
[11:34:53] <NoiseEee> McEasy: partAFunction() { setProgressBar('33'); }    partBFunction { setProgressBar('66'); }  //etc
[11:40:30] <jshanab> I am trying to migrate my tabs to jquery ui 1.10 if I give them an href they load but that breaks the assigned id to the div and I can laod more than once and it does not replace my div at the biginning. If I use the href=#myid and a div with the id=myid , beforeLoad: never gets called.   How the heck do i lazy load using ajax with the new tab API?
[11:45:06] <naeluh> Hi I have a form and I have a div that I want to show the results of the form as the form is being completed is there a good way to do this
[11:45:09] <naeluh> thanks
[11:46:12] <gho5t> that's a pretty ambiguous question
[11:49:51] <iredmedia> LOL @ gho5t
[11:49:55] <iredmedia> Agreed.
[11:50:04] <gho5t> lol
[11:52:26] <davesleep> you want to show what has been typed in the form?
[11:54:30] <naeluh> sorry about that
[11:55:22] <naeluh> yeah so I have several select options and radio buttons and I would like to display the values of those as the questions are being answered
[11:56:26] <McEasy> NoiseEee: Not quite what I was looking for, but I blame it on my confusing question. Thanks for the help though and I've got it implemented!
[11:56:53] <davesleep> one moment
[12:00:08] <davesleep> i think you can use 'keyup'
[12:00:39] <jshanab> Anyone know how to lazy load the new tabs API? the href="#1" never calls beforeLoad so I can modify the url I need the id on the div to be determined by me
[12:01:05] <davesleep> keyup(validate) on your div like $('#optionboxdiv').keyup(validate); then run function validate (){}
[12:01:20] <davesleep> and do your stuff in the validate function naeluh
[12:01:27] <davesleep> (you can label validate what you want)
[12:01:37] <davesleep> actually for options i dunno if that'd work
[12:03:39] <naeluh> davesleep: thanks I will take a look at that - I mean I think if I use ajax to display var state = $('select').val(); as I run thru the form it could do it I was just wondering if there is another way
[12:05:03] <davesleep> nah i dont think what i suggested will work, the keyup thing i used to check if a username exists
[12:05:34] <davesleep> for new user reg
[12:07:17] <jshanab> After 3-4 days trying to solve this, I guess I will just have to declare the new tabs ui broken and roll it all back?
[12:13:34] <wh0ami> i've got a <select> menu and inside <option>, option tags have got data-class
[12:13:47] <wh0ami> how can i get the value of the selected option data-class?
[12:14:37] <jedimind> im assuming you're suing the option's value for something else?
[12:14:48] <jedimind> using*
[12:16:01] <wh0ami> yeah, i've got two <select> menus
[12:16:02] <iredmedia> You mean.... option inside a select? Because the other way
[12:16:19] <wh0ami> yeah, http://pastebin.com/Y9V9YpHs its the code
[12:16:44] <iredmedia> value of the option thats been selected?
[12:17:09] <jedimind> myâ€¦ internet is too slow to load a pastebin
[12:17:12] * jedimind gives up on life
[12:17:56] <wh0ami> from $characters array only get 1, and guid its 45
[12:18:05] <wh0ami> guid = value
[12:18:24] <wh0ami> so exists value -1 and 45
[12:18:51] <iredmedia> I don't get your issue
[12:19:08] <iredmedia> What do you want to retrieve? The value of the SELECTED OPTIONS attr?
[12:19:12] <jedimind> he's just trying to pull out the value of the data attribute of the currently selected option
[12:19:15] <iredmedia> 'data-class'
[12:19:19] <ajmrsn> PUT /issue HTTP/1.1 \r\n HOST: iredmedia
[12:19:29] <iredmedia> :\.
[12:20:22] <iredmedia> $('option:selected').data('name')
[12:20:23] <iredmedia> one way
[12:20:32] <wh0ami> i want get data-class from selected <option>
[12:20:42] <iredmedia> okay change 'name'to class
[12:21:41] <iredmedia> or $(something).find('option[class="' + $('select').val() +'"]')
[12:22:15] <iredmedia> The first says "find selected option". give me data attr 'name' (yopu may want to use 'prop')
[12:23:21] <iredmedia> second says: get me all options, and find the one who matches the value selected,
[12:26:09] <veinofstars> I am passing multiple deferreds to a $.when() call.  I want to execute a function after all deferrers have either been resolved or rejected, but the master deferred that gets created rejects as soon as one of my original deferreds rejects
[12:26:26] <veinofstars> so .always() gets called as soon as one deferred is rejected
[12:26:46] <wh0ami> iredmedia: it prints 5
[12:26:51] <wh0ami> but isnt the true value
[12:27:14] <iredmedia> I didn't check the values
[12:27:15] <iredmedia> one sec
[12:28:02] <wh0ami> ok
[12:28:17] <iredmedia> Can you create a fiddle showing basically what you did?
[12:28:47] <iredmedia> i can't see how you'd get an incorrect value based on what i see there.
[12:32:00] <tab1293> I am trying to use the on function to bind a click event to an element that will be added in the future but it doesnt seem to be working
[12:32:33] <tab1293> the function works are elements that are loaded initially but it doesnt work for elements that are loaded on the page later on
[12:32:33] <wh0ami> iredmedia: http://jsfiddle.net/KvJA6/1/
[12:32:33] <tab1293> anyone might now why?
[12:32:37] <NoiseEee> tab1293: $(someContainerAtPresent).on('click','yourAddedElement.className',function() { //do stuff });
[12:32:37] <Saaether> `demo @ tab1293
[12:32:37] <b-ot> tab1293: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[12:32:48] <NoiseEee> tab1293: its called event delegation.
[12:32:55] <tab1293> NoiseEee, you need that second parameter?
[12:33:37] <wh0ami> (data-charclass i changed now for seeing if its a problem or not)
[12:33:41] <tab1293> i have it like this http://pastebin.com/VGa9MwTq
[12:33:41] <NoiseEee> yes, to refer to the element/classes you're adding / what you REALLY want to be the event initatior
[12:33:59] <tab1293> NoiseEee, ^
[12:34:47] <NoiseEee> tab1293: as you've noticed, that won't do anything on elements with .playSong class added after DOM load
[12:34:51] <NoiseEee> tab1293: $(someContainerAtPresent).on('click','yourAddedElement.className',function() { //do stuff });
[12:34:51] <Saaether> $(".playSong").on("click", function() { should be $(document or 'parent of click that exists at page oad').on("click",'.playSong', function() {
[12:35:15] <Saaether> err parent of playsong derp
[12:36:48] <tab1293> okay
[12:37:07] <jedimind> NO ITS NOT OKAY
[12:37:14] <jedimind> sorry, ive had a lot of coffee today
[12:53:24] <lethjakman> hey, I'm not seeing $.uniform.update() in the docs is that a part of standard jquery?
[12:53:29] <lethjakman> or am I just missing it?
[12:53:47] <wh0ami> how can i change a selected <option>?
[12:54:26] <CWSpear> wh0ami, $('select').val('Banana')
[12:54:34] <CWSpear> if one of the options value="Banana"
[12:58:57] <wh0ami> CWSpear: its possible to change automatically to an available value? i remove them with hide()
[12:59:47] <CWSpear> wh0ami, I'm not sure what you mean.
[12:59:56] <CWSpear> automatically when what happens?
[13:00:10] <BillCriswell> I hate websites.
[13:00:12] <wh0ami> i want to say
[13:00:19] <wh0ami> i have onchange="checkRole()"
[13:00:43] <wh0ami> when X value are chosen on a <option> i hide() or show()
[13:00:59] <wh0ami> depending of some values
[13:02:40] <Al1> hi everyone
[13:02:42] <CWSpear> So just when you're show/hiding them, change the value then, wh0ami
[13:02:52] <Al1> got a question about jQuery File Upload
[13:03:09] <wh0ami> yeah but how to change to the next value which are able?
[13:03:13] <naeluh> Hi is .on() available in jquery 1.3.2 or I would do that ?
[13:03:18] <wh0ami> dinamically
[13:03:27] <naeluh> how * would i do that
[13:04:03] <wh0ami> maybe if its possible to get all values from all option tags which are show() then i know how to do
[13:04:17] <Al1> im using this script - https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload - and whenever page loads it triggers fileupload, even though there's nothing to upload and it gets "null" in JSON response, so when my page loads it shows an empty table that has NULL for its values
[13:05:04] <Al1> anyone come across something like that?
[13:06:04] <naeluh> oh I see its click and change
[13:07:01] <lethjakman> this is weird...I see mentions of jQuery.uniform.update() all over the web...but when I search for uniform on api.jquery.com nothing shows up. I must be searching for the wrong thing.
[13:07:36] <iredmedia> Maybe google uniform.js?
[13:07:56] <wh0ami> how can i get all values from all option tags which are not hide()?
[13:07:57] <iredmedia> http://uniformjs.com/#docs
[13:08:16] <iredmedia> lethjakman, ^
[13:08:33] <lethjakman> iredmedia: hrm, is it included in jquery normally?
[13:09:10] <iredmedia> lethjakman: No. It's a plugin for jquery
[13:10:37] <wh0ami> how can i get all values from all option tags which are not hide()?
[13:10:40] <iredmedia> wh0ami: check for $('option[hidden]') ? depends on what u mean by .hide, because you could be setting the ATTRIBUTE, or the CSS... $('.selector').css('display')
[13:10:48] <Gmac_> how can i use a selector with a data attribute?
[13:10:51] <Gmac_> i tried:
[13:10:54] <iredmedia> where display can be 'display, hidden, visibility',
[13:11:06] <Gmac_> 'a[data-filter = something]
[13:11:11] <Gmac_> but nothinghappens
[13:11:12] <wh0ami> iredmedia: i can set disabled attrib but i think display its more easy to check
[13:11:15] <iredmedia> $('selector[attribute="someValue"]')
[13:11:20] <iredmedia> Gmac_: ^
[13:11:32] <Gmac_> illt ry it
[13:11:56] <iredmedia> wh0ami: pretty much the same idea as what the guy is asking above $('selector[attribute="someValue"]')
[13:13:33] <iredmedia> wh0ami: aka $('option[disabled="disabled"]') or $('option[disabled]')
[13:13:51] <wh0ami> iredmedia: im doing $('#roleTank').hide()
[13:13:53] <wh0ami> for example
[13:14:07] <wh0ami> <option value="0" id="roleTank">Tank</option>
[13:14:15] <iredmedia> right. so you'll be getting a css value of display: [none/block]
[13:15:04] <iredmedia> wh0ami: So using $().css('display') which will give you 'block/none/inline/etc', is the easiest way
[13:15:21] <wh0ami> ok :)
[13:22:15] <Al1> im using this script - https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-UploadÂ - and whenever page loads it triggers fileupload, even though there's nothing to upload and it gets "null" in JSON response, so when my page loads it shows an empty table that has NULL for its values
[13:31:43] <Gmac_> I'm trying to place an event on the whole screen except for the any classes with listing
[13:31:45] <Gmac_> body:not(.listing)
[13:31:48] <Gmac_> not wokring
[13:32:34] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: That would only work if the body doesn't have a class of "listing". IS that your goal?
[13:32:38] <BillCriswell> s/IS/Is*
[13:32:44] <Gmac_> ohhh
[13:32:47] <Gmac_> ding dong
[13:33:04] <Abbas|> i hvae 2 divs with the class 'menu' . how do i select the first menu with jquery ( trying to add an element to it and not the 2nd div of same class)
[13:33:15] <BillCriswell> Now Dr. Dre will be stuck in my head.
[13:33:37] <BillCriswell> Abbas|: $('.menu').eq(0) could work
[13:33:44] <BillCriswell> Or $('.menu').first()
[13:33:54] <Abbas|> ok thank you :) i was trying to think of eq for a bit, couldnt re call it!
[13:34:55] <Gmac_> so how can i say body but not the div within called lsiting
[13:35:23] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: $('body').on('click', ':not(.listing)', getFunky); should do the trick.
[13:37:01] <Gmac_> not working
[13:37:05] <Gmac_> the listing can set it off
[13:38:40] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: So you want to trigger an eveny if any click happened as long as the element that triggered it doesn't have the class "listing" on it?
[13:38:48] <BillCriswell> s/eveny/event
[13:38:52] <Gmac_> yes
[13:39:23] <BillCriswell> Just set up this demo and it seems good: http://jsbin.com/ovosik/1/edit
[13:39:31] <Gmac_> well i had a click vent which triggered something and now i made a one time event using one() that allows u to click anywhere else and shut it off
[13:39:46] <Gmac_> i placed ev.stoppropagation and I've done it b4
[13:40:29] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: I'd need to see some code. Don't have the attention span for all that right now.
[13:51:22] <Toerkeium> hello everyone
[13:51:46] <Toerkeium> do you know why I get always data "undefined" here? http://pastie.org/8187807#2,4,109,215-216,248-249
[13:54:03] <BillCriswell> Did you highlight lines at random to mess with my brain?
[13:54:45] <Toerkeium> ohh sorry, didn't realize I made it
[13:55:35] <Toerkeium> there: http://pastie.org/8187807#1,215
[13:56:06] <Toerkeium> damn, I didn't make select line 1 :P)
[13:58:16] <Toerkeium> the function is working "perfect". The only problem is that I can't validate when there are no results as data is always undefined
[13:58:42] <BillCriswell> Toerkeium: In #sbname?
[13:58:54] <Toerkeium> yes
[13:59:29] <Toerkeium> the alert(data) I put there on line 215 always returns undefined
[14:01:29] <BillCriswell> Toerkeium: Do you see the request going through in the Network tab?
[14:02:28] <Toerkeium> BillCriswell: yes, it's going, it's working
[14:02:51] <Toerkeium> the only problem is that, I can't validate. I don't know what I did wrong
[14:03:38] <jshanab> How do I do something on tab destroy ?
[14:06:44] <Gmac_> ok here is a code pen
[14:06:46] <Gmac_> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Emgcf
[14:06:46] <Gmac_> something with bubbling up through the dom is the answer right?
[14:09:22] <BillCriswell> Toerkeium: Throw in alert('Something') right before the $("#sbname").click part, just want to make sure that's the issue
[14:09:48] <BillCriswell> Let me know if it works after you add the alert() in there
[14:09:52] <Toerkeium> let me see
[14:10:36] <Toerkeium> yes BillCriswell, it makes the alet
[14:10:42] <Toerkeium> when I call the page
[14:11:21] <Gmac_> anyone?
[14:11:29] <Gmac_> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Emgcf
[14:12:23] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ugdnC Does this clear it up?
[14:12:54] <Gmac_> yeah y?
[14:13:02] <Gmac_> why can i select everywhere but listing?
[14:13:31] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: Because of the :not(.listing)
[14:13:43] <Gmac_> im confused
[14:13:46] <Gmac_> as usualy
[14:14:14] <Gmac_> i shouldn't have to select that div
[14:14:19] <Gmac_> why cant i click anywhere int he body
[14:14:20] <Al1> im using https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload - and when my page loads, the upload script get fired up also and performs empty file upload
[14:14:27] <Al1> how can i stop that
[14:15:20] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: You're stopping propagation when you click a .listing, you change the background color red then you add the one click event to .wrap. You can't click on .wrap without clicking a .listing ( easily ).
[14:15:47] <Gmac_> why i thought bubbling is only upward
[14:15:57] <Gmac_> make wrap 500px in height
[14:16:00] <Gmac_> it doesn't matter
[14:16:02] <Gmac_> it won't work
[14:20:37] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: I think the :not(.listing) doesn't count the .wrap element?
[14:20:59] <Gmac_> whee is it looking?
[14:21:44] <Gmac_> where*
[14:21:58] <BillCriswell> It's children.
[14:22:01] <BillCriswell> Its*
[14:22:12] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/ecarow/2/ is what I came up with.
[14:22:23] <Gmac_> and listing is a child
[14:25:27] <BillCriswell> Toerkeium: Pretty tough following your code this late in the day for me haha
[14:27:05] <BillCriswell> Toerkeium: How many requests is this retuning: return $.when.apply($, requests);
[14:27:39] <Gmac_> and i was using one() for the second click function which was inside the other so it shuts off after once but apparently thats no good
[14:27:52] <Gmac_> it fires now regardless because of the if statement
[14:28:01] <Gmac_> so i switched it to on
[14:28:09] <naeluh> Is there any way to use .serialize() to display all the results from a form before submit ? or should I use something lke .each() and .text() ? thanks
[14:28:09] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: You keep reapplying it every time you click a listing.
[14:28:16] <Toerkeium> BillCriswell: what do you mean by "how many"? only one? when searching(); finishes
[14:28:30] <Gmac_> does this mean its gonna make a thousasand click events each time some clicks?
[14:28:38] <Gmac_> thats why wanted to use one
[14:28:50] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: What's your end goal?
[14:29:03] <Gmac_> i made an else statement to shut it off
[14:29:09] <BillCriswell> Toerkeium: Ok.
[14:29:13] <BillCriswell> Gmac_: I meant
[14:29:54] <shoky> Toerkeium: you're not returning anything inside the map, i think
[14:31:10] <Toerkeium> shoky: checking
[14:31:25] <BillCriswell> shoky: Good eye.
[14:31:45] <BillCriswell> I think?
[14:31:47] <BillCriswell> Probably.
[14:32:42] <Toerkeium> yes, it was that shoky
[14:32:56] <Toerkeium> I just add a return true inside the $map and voilá!
[14:33:06] <shoky> true?
[14:33:17] <shoky> then uh. what's the $.when for?
[14:33:39] <Toerkeium> just testing
[14:34:04] <Toerkeium> but anyway, I do everything inside the $map (append html stuff to some elements)
[14:35:01] <Toerkeium> the then works for it as when the function finishes, I do show the results or an alert with "no results"
[14:36:01] <shoky> hokay
[14:36:32] <Toerkeium> thanks a lot guys
[14:36:39] <Toerkeium> I've been a week with this
[14:37:50] <BillCriswell> Welcome
[14:38:06] <Toerkeium> :)
[14:38:08] <BillCriswell> I'm out of here. Later guys.
[14:38:14] <BillCriswell> and ladies
[14:38:20] <shoky> ~\o
[14:39:02] <dwarder> does .off has a delegate?
[14:39:06] <dwarder> .off()
[14:39:11] <dwarder> have*
[14:39:21] <shoky> meaning?
[14:39:45] <dwarder> shoky: i've set .on with the delegate i want to turn it off
[14:40:21] <dwarder> or i just use off without a delegate
[14:40:22] <dwarder> ?
[14:40:22] <s3b`> Hey.. I have a bunch of draggables with a ton of different click events. Is there a way to disable the click while it's being dragged, and then re-enable it on drag stop? preferably without any code on the .click() {} handler
[14:40:31] <naeluh> can someone gimme a hand ? 	Is there any way to use .serialize() to display all the results from a form before submit ? or should I use something lke .each() and .text() ? thanks
[14:41:13] <shoky> dwarder: .off('click')  would remove all event handlers on an element. both delegated and not delegated
[14:42:58] <Al1> anyone familiar with https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload script?
[14:43:18] <dwarder> shoky: i see, thank you
[14:45:08] <shoky> naeluh: maybe you want .serializeArray()
[14:45:21] <naeluh> I am kinda of stuck on this ?
[14:45:32] <naeluh> cool let me check that out
[14:45:38] <naeluh> thanks
[14:46:39] <naeluh> shoky: that looks very promising thanks
[14:48:05] <Al1> anyone familiar with https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-UploadÂ script? can't figure out why script starts up ajax call when page loads
[14:55:29] <Rejected> Let's say I have a div element serving as a canvas and several draggable elements. Is there a way to define where the individual elements will be placed within a container when using jQueryUI's Draggable plugin?
[14:56:26] <naeluh> var state = $('select').val(); if (state == "Accredited California","Head Start or Child Development Center","Preschool (students are 2+ years)","Club") How would I get this be true if any of these ? it works for one but not for multiple ?
[14:57:21] <ngharo> use else ifs, or put your login in a seperate method, or use a regexp
[14:57:39] <ngharo> or a switch
[14:57:49] <ngharo> s/login/logic/
[14:58:21] <shoky> or $.inArray / .indexOf
[14:59:11] <shoky> Rejected: css?
[15:00:28] <Rejected> shoky but is there a way to do it dynamically?
[15:00:59] <shoky> whatcha mean
[15:01:06] <Rejected> the way I have it now all the elements are being rendered at the top left corner of the browser window
[15:01:37] <Rejected> I'd like to arrange them in a way they wouldn't overlap one other
[15:03:06] <shoky> sortable has some of that functionality, i guess
[15:04:30] <Rejected> ops, my bad.. I didn't notice that particular plugin in the list.. I'll look into it then, tks a lot
[15:10:39] <s3b`> How do you extend a jquery function? lets say, for simple sake, I want to override $.click(), so that it says "console.log('click!')" and then runs standard .click()
[15:14:20] <shoky> s3b`:  var _click = $.fn.click;  $.fn.click = function() { console.log('click!'); return _click.apply(this, arguments); };
[15:15:16] <s3b`> shoky: That's pretty much what I have, but the log is executing when the page loads and not when the item is clicked
[15:15:33] <shoky> s3b`: because that's when you're calling .click(...)
[15:16:10] <s3b`> Ohh
[15:16:27] <s3b`> So that's not when I want it, i don't want the log to execute until the click event
[15:17:02] <shoky> then.. log it from the click handler
[15:18:50] <sunbeam> whats the easiest way now a days to display tweets with jquery plugin?
[15:19:12] <s3b`> shoky: I want to disable clicks for the whole page temporarily, and the only method I found is to have a true/false set up
[15:19:21] <s3b`> What i'm trying to do is make it so I don't have to write the if handlers on each click event
[15:29:40] <naeluh> shoky: was $inArray directed at me ?
[15:31:05] <ValsiS> Hello
[15:31:32] <ValsiS> can somebody help me with a problem
[15:32:40] <KeyboardNotFound> Can you please send me e-book for learning jquery ?
[15:33:09] <ValsiS> when i click on a button, i recive 2 modal box with the same content , to can access the first modal, i need first to close second module
[15:33:36] <ValsiS> how to prevent to don't open 2 times
[15:34:16] <Al1> in how can i change txt on click and toggle back to previous
[15:34:23] <Al1> i.e. open close buttons?
[15:34:38] <dwarder> can i use :not in delegate .on() ?
[15:36:13] <dwarder> something like $('#outerdiv').on('click',':checkbox:not(:checked)', function () ...
[15:36:30] <dwarder> this doesn't seem to work
[15:37:16] <dwarder> hmm
[15:37:28] <ngharo> i believe you want the change event for checkboxes, not click
[15:37:53] <dwarder> ngharo: i want a disablet checkbox react on click
[15:38:07] <dwarder> +to
[15:38:15] <dismist> use unchecked in the selector itself
[15:38:29] <dismist> whatever the jquery property is for it
[15:38:40] <ngharo> i'd just check if(this.disabled) in the handler
[15:39:23] <dwarder> i disabled a checkbox, i want to click on this checkbox and ... alert popups
[15:39:50] <dwarder> ngharo: where is that if?
[15:39:53] <dwarder> "if"
[15:40:16] <dwarder> ahh i see
[15:41:46] <dwarder> ngharo: disabled checkbox doesn't react on click
[15:41:55] <dwarder> why?
[15:44:37] <ngharo> looks like disabled inputs dont fire a click event
[15:45:09] <ngharo> seems like bad UI practice to have a user click on a disabled element
[15:45:23] <ngharo> that's kind of the whole point to prevent them from clicking on it
[15:55:05] <hussan> hi
[15:55:12] <hussan> i create a jquery mobile app
[15:55:27] <hussan> it is work in chrome, firefox, opera
[15:55:33] <hussan> in opera ipad
[15:55:39] <hussan> but in android browser is not work
[15:55:43] <hussan> any can help?
[16:01:40] <naeluh> so I have a series of select options and they all have different values and for 4 I want one thing to happan for 4 of them I want another thing to happen is there a way to set 4 values to true and 4 values to false ?
[16:06:40] <majuscule> How can I run two different animate() functions simultaniously?
[16:09:50] <ngharo> combine the properties you're animating in a single call
[16:10:26] <majuscule> they are different properties, on different objects, i'm not sure how to do that
[16:12:19] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/duL8X/1/ ?
[16:14:55] <majuscule> oh wow interesting, i guess it'l just work :-)
[16:15:08] <majuscule> i didn't even try it like that because i figured they'd be sequential
[16:15:11] <majuscule> thank you! :-)
[16:15:18] <ngharo> np
[16:26:23] <naeluh> I mean I got it to work with if else statements but I wanted to something a little more elegant here is what I ended up doing
[16:26:25] <naeluh> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/TeMRw/
[16:27:01] <naeluh> is there any to grab the values like thru an array of some sort ?
[16:29:14] <naeluh> a better way*
[16:38:20] <DarkGhost`> so I have $(this).attr('href'); how would I seperate href by the $_get values such as ?mem_code=3343&veh_code=4353 how could I do that cleeanly, maybe there is a function?
[16:48:20] <ngharo> there are plugins, google jquery parse query string
[16:49:35] <ngharo> else something like
[16:49:39] <ngharo> var params = {}; $.each(this.href.replace('?', '').split('&'), function() { var kv = this.split('='); params[kv[0]] = kv[1]; });
[17:08:38] <DarkGhost`> thanks ngharo
[17:08:49] <Zak> hey guys. Does jquery have an in-built mechanism to turn query parameters into an object? I can't seem to find out
[17:08:52] <Zak> *find one
[17:08:57] <Zak> oh lol
[17:09:00] <DarkGhost`> lmao
[17:09:01] <Zak> DarkGhost` already asked
[17:09:02] <DarkGhost`> I literally just asked.
[17:09:13] <Zak> why doesn't jquery have this?
[17:09:19] <DarkGhost`> they have a plugin
[17:09:42] <Zak> it just seems odd that the library has object->query string but not the other way around
[17:10:10] <Zak> it would be like supplying JSON stringify but not parse
[17:12:52] <zuloyd> hi
[17:13:32] <zuloyd> is it normal that doing    $("#something").html("<div id='myDiv'></div>");   and then immediately   $("#myDiv").something  doesn't work?
[17:15:27] <BillCriswell> You guys can write one up yourself pretty easily.
[17:18:19] <BillCriswell> zuloyd: What is "something"?
[17:18:42] <zuloyd> some element that is already in the DOM
[17:19:03] <zuloyd> and the other thing just a deliberate method of a jquery object
[17:19:29] <BillCriswell> I meant the .something.
[17:20:36] <BillCriswell> zuloyd: http://jsbin.com/edumul/2/edit
[17:20:58] <zuloyd> thanks
[17:21:05] <zuloyd> so it does seem to work
[17:21:12] <BillCriswell> zuloyd: Yes.
[17:21:18] <BillCriswell> Works just the way you have it too.
[17:21:25] <BillCriswell> Just don't know what .something is.
[17:33:58] <BillCriswell> Just went through all this trouble writing validation and realized I can just use HTML5 since the admin is for Chrome only.
[17:33:59] <BillCriswell> Dammit.
[18:16:19] <hye> hi i am using .each... and in the each i have a function called CalculatePrice();  does this mean jquery will wait for the CalculatePrice to finish doing math before calling it again? or it doesn't wait and just calls the next one in rapid fire?
[18:20:27] <BillCriswell> hye: It depends what's going on in CalculatePrice.
[18:20:44] <hye> calculateprice is editing an object...
[18:20:51] <hye> when its called too fast, they step over each other i think
[18:20:52] <hye> but am not sure
[18:21:28] <BillCriswell> Can you provide a demo? If you're doing ajax requests it can mix things up but it should be fine.
[18:21:37] <hye> its not doing an ajax request
[18:22:00] <hye> i don't have a demo
[18:22:22] <BillCriswell> hye: Then it's happening in order.
[18:22:51] <hye> but i am guessing since I am using .each  it's not waiting for CalculatePrice to complete before calling that function again
[18:23:42] <freannrak> I've got bunch of JSON objects with IDs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. I need to process them in reverse order (7, 6...). How might I do that? http://dpaste.com/1322467/
[18:24:15] <BillCriswell> hye: Do console.log( whateverYouReturn ) right before what you return in your function and see if it's what you expect.
[18:24:32] <hye> its not what i expect
[18:27:11] <BillCriswell> hye: Hard to know what's wrong without the code here. It's not a problem with the loop going faster than the output of the function.
[18:28:17] <hye> well...  i just need to know when i run a .each and in the .each i call a function, will that called function execute and finish before the next .each loop is called?  thats it
[18:29:26] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[18:29:49] <hye> ok thanx BillCriswell
[18:29:52] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[18:29:56] <hye> ill give it another burst
[18:30:04] <BillCriswell> hye: Doing any kind of timeouts or anything?
[18:30:16] <hye> no
[18:31:22] <BillCriswell> freannrak: The only way I could think of is grabbing all the properties into an array, reversing that array and looking it up in the original
[18:31:56] <BillCriswell> hye: Are you creating the function in the loop?
[18:32:08] <hye> no just calling it
[18:32:28] <freannrak> BillCriswell: I was just thinking the same thing... thanks :=)
[18:33:01] <dblosevn> Got a question I have a deferred object that I want to chain another deferred to but, I dont want the first deferred to resolve before the second how can I make this happen?
[18:33:41] <dblosevn> when I cant modify the code that will resolve the first
[18:33:47] <BillCriswell> freannrak: If you use underscore there's: http://underscorejs.org/#keys
[18:34:18] <BillCriswell> dblosevn: The order doesn't matter?
[18:34:26] <dblosevn> does it not?
[18:35:05] <BillCriswell> dblosevn: ... I'm confused.
[18:35:33] <dblosevn> I want to chain a defferred to the deferred passed into jqms pagebeforeload and run some preprocessing in pageload and I dont want the rest of jqms events to fire until my preprocessing is done
[18:35:56] <freannrak> BillCriswell: I do, thanks.
[18:35:56] <neataroni> i'm trying to spin a spinner whenever there is an ajax call- this doesn't work though, for some reason: http://bpaste.net/show/OoxOb37XxqQbctxQVJyt/
[18:36:22] <BillCriswell> dblosevn: So you have two requests, you don't care what order they finish as long as they finish, then you want to do some other stuff?
[18:37:53] <dblosevn> well I cant get a reference to the deferred in pageload where I really need it so I was thinking of storeing a reference to it in pagebeforeload, then in pageload chaining a new deferred to it to run about 5 other async tasks before I resolve annd let jqm move on
[18:38:40] <dblosevn> or am i misunderstanding something?
[18:38:53] <BillCriswell> dblosevn: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/ Does this help?
[18:39:08] <neataroni> aha- the solution to my problem (for the logs): http://bpaste.net/show/cdBZJCzrXMyhscGPHibE/
[18:39:15] <dblosevn> eg... if I chain another deferred to the one passed to me will it wait to resolve the first until after the second?
[18:40:06] <BillCriswell> dblosevn: Sounds about right.
[18:40:08] <dblosevn> basically I dont want the first deferred to resolve until after mine
[18:41:28] <dblosevn> but jqm will resolve the first far before any of my code is done
[18:41:28] <BillCriswell> I'm not familiar enough with jQuery mobile to really follow what's going on I don't think.
[18:43:11] <dblosevn> im trying to run some async tasks before pageshow and not let pageshow fire until my tasks complete
[18:44:51] <BillCriswell> $.when( $.get('/foo'), $.get('/bar') ).done(function(){ do page show }); is the only thing that comes to mind.
[18:45:24] <dblosevn> ya but I dont have any access to the internals of jqm to "do pageshow"
[18:45:42] <dblosevn> and im not allowed to modify jqm to get the behavior I want
[18:45:53] <dblosevn> nor do I really want to
[18:46:21] <BillCriswell> It looks like there's a pagebeforeshow event?
[18:46:30] <dblosevn> ya thats what im using now
[18:46:56] <dblosevn> the problem is the page is loaded with no content and when my tasks complete the content is loaded in
[18:47:23] <dblosevn> so it basically loads a blank page then about 500ms later it has the content
[18:48:32] <BillCriswell> dblosevn: I'd just have to play around with all the events before I go what I wanted.
[18:48:40] <BillCriswell> before I got*
[18:49:32] <dblosevn> ya I have the problem is that there isnt an event that gives me what I need, pageload is the closest as its the first event that has the new content for the page loaded in the dom
[18:49:52] <dblosevn> I just need jqm to wait until im ready before moving on
[18:51:02] <dblosevn> by the way this is phonegap, and the requests arent xhr requests its native code being run to pull db queries etc so it happens pretty quick just not quick enough to beat the pageshow animation
[18:51:47] <BillCriswell> dblosevn: Yeah never messed with that sadly.
[18:53:31] <dblosevn> imma try .when and see if it works
[19:34:06] <CapMax> hi
[19:34:12] <CapMax> is it possible to check if an element by a given ID exists?
[19:39:07] <pixelpimp> you can test .length on your match, e.g. if ($('#given').length > 1)
[19:39:20] <pixelpimp> >= rather
[19:42:04] <CapMax> does it have to be more than 1?
[19:44:07] <pixelpimp> what?
[19:44:18] <pixelpimp> i guess that depends on what you need...
[19:49:11] <CapMax> pixelpimp: check to check if the element exists
[19:50:01] <pixelpimp> if it's 0, then it doesn't exist...
[19:50:06] <pixelpimp> otherwise, it obviously does
[19:50:46] <CapMax> cool
[19:51:00] <CapMax> so without > 1 it would still work then right
[19:55:04] <Al1> i need help with some jquery - go this code - https://gist.github.com/albertpak/d2f09ea413cc670b209a - and when i click on hte button it does make the switch, classes and text changes, but instead of actually showing an icon from Font Awesome, it renders text as is - i.e. Add&nbsp;<i class='icon-plus-sign'></i> shows upâ€¦how can i display it as an icon/render as needed?
[19:55:44] <loopsdeer1> use .html() instead of .text()?
[19:55:50] <loopsdeer1> That's just a guess, didn't try to run the code
[19:56:33] <Al1> @loopseedr1 wow, good one
[19:56:35] <Al1> thank you :)

[20:01:38] <Al1> nvm, my bad
[20:01:45] <pishposh> http://jsfiddle.net/cf574/5/
[20:01:45] <rmill> It has no idea what `<%= @repo.url%>/contents?access_token=<%=@repo.owner.token%>` Is, ;)
[20:02:16] <rmill> Looks like Angular JS magic to me.
[20:02:30] <pishposh> rmill: of course, but i can't dump my whole rails app in jsfiddle so i'm just using it as a paste bin so i don't have to paste it here
[20:02:55] <rmill> Well, it should work then
[20:03:07] <rmill> if that outputs a valid request
[20:03:14] <rmill> and .data has a length
[20:03:23] <rmill> er, `data
[20:03:34] <pishposh> console.log(data[0]["name"] gives back the name of the first item
[20:03:49] <pishposh> the each statement gives back 10 undefined
[20:27:59] <Al1> anyone has experience with this plugin: https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine ?
[20:28:19] <Al1> im trying to disable an upload button if an input is empty, but it still submits

[20:36:23] <Al1> holla
[20:46:07] <dblosevn> since when is this a syntax error if (undefined === varname) I got varname was undefined and it broke my code? Ive been doing that for years and it always worked in the past
[21:50:12] <blunderboy> I have a pull request ready to be sumitted to jquery but one of the members suggested me to include a test case too..
[21:50:19] <blunderboy> Can somebody please help me ?
[21:50:57] <blunderboy> Should I create a js fiddle and give the link that issue is fixed.
[21:52:25] <blunderboy> Does it mean I need to write a unit test for it ?
[21:57:39] <obert> blunderboy: i would to do a static testcase, always
[22:05:00] <shodan45> any idea how I can run code for .ready, while earlier code in another .ready (that I can't change) throws an error?
[22:05:16] <shodan45> did that even make sense? :)
[22:16:40] <dblosevn> shodan45: if i understand you properly you have one .ready throwing an error and in the same file you have another .ready that wont run, this is normal, if anything fails in the file all further code wont be executed
[22:17:28] <dblosevn> code in another file re remote scripts will run however, eg another script tag
[23:24:36] <Beg_> hey guys how would you debug a page that crashes after 3-4 hours of running?
[23:24:48] <Beg_> and the page only reloads itself
[23:24:57] <Beg_> so nothing is really changing
[23:51:49] <boof> is there any function I could use to capture video from a camera on a cell phone natively in a browser?
[23:52:22] <NielsNLx> Beg_: How about adding a log file where you add some info about what you are doing?
[23:53:56] <boof> if not, is there any way I could atleast get the phone to switch to the camera application and then have it upload the video automatically?
[23:54:51] <NoOova> Hello!

[23:58:33] <NielsNLx> NoOova: Just do $('#elem').css('top','10px');
