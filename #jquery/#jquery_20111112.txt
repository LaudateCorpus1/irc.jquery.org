[00:10:35] <Prot> question: i'd like to do a kind of onload or 'plugin' custom attribute in the html to run code, but wouldn't want to mess with any strict standards. is there a commonly accepted way of doing this
[00:10:38] <Prot> dont want to use <script>
[00:10:53] <Prot> do I have to use data-[name] if I want to do that?
[00:14:22] <jeremyckahn> Prot:  Yeah, use a `data` attribute.
[00:14:48] <jeremyckahn> It's the preferred way to bind arbitrary data to the DOM that doesn't relate to any standards.
[00:22:26] <Prot> thx jeremyckahn
[00:22:49] <Prot> is it ok to do like $('*[data-plugin]').each ... on load to run a bunch of custom code
[00:22:54] <Prot> or is that inefficient?
[00:24:33] <jeremyckahn> Prot:  Yeah, that'd would be pretty slow.
[00:24:57] <Prot> just find <script ugly
[00:25:10] <Prot> and you have to assign ids or select elements you want to deal with
[00:25:18] <jeremyckahn> Maybe it the data you want was bound only to elements with a certain class name?
[00:25:28] <Prot> searching by class is faster?
[00:25:31] <jeremyckahn> *if
[00:25:35] <jeremyckahn> Yes, so...
[00:25:57] <Prot> i figure by tag is faster
[00:25:59] <jeremyckahn> If the data you want was only bound to .foo, you could do $('.foo').data()
[00:26:11] <jeremyckahn> Yeah that's even better, if you can make that work for you.
[00:26:20] <Prot> maybe I'll just limit it to :input
[00:26:20] <jeremyckahn> Well… maybe.
[00:26:47] <jeremyckahn> I actually don't know, it depends on the browser and how many elements of a certain type there are on the page.
[00:27:16] <Prot> yeah
[00:27:25] <Prot> guess I just need to benchmark if I really care about that
[00:27:35] <jeremyckahn> The newer browser support document.getElementsByClassName, so that would be pretty fast.  Other than that, it's a shot in the dark.
[00:27:47] <jeremyckahn> Yeah… it will likely not matter.
[00:27:54] <Prot> wondering about smartphones and etc
[00:28:10] <Prot> yeah i have a problem with microoptimization
[00:28:15] <Prot> gotta get over it
[00:31:37] <Prot> well, it looks like jquery is absurdly efficient
[00:31:37] <Prot> http://mootools.net/slickspeed/
[00:31:41] <Prot> so I'll just forget about it
[00:40:54] <jeremyckahn> Prot: yeah, things like this are pretty optimized by now.  You wanna avoid selectors that are complex or have no native browser optimization.
[00:41:12] <Prot> i'm just going to stick to $('*[data-plugin]')
[00:41:16] <Prot> if we're really talking 1ms here
[00:41:17] <jeremyckahn> Classes, id, byElement…. these should all be pretty fast.
[00:41:23] <jeremyckahn> yeah.
[00:41:37] <Prot> also thinking of [onload]
[00:41:42] <Prot> because ie actually uses that for some fields
[00:41:45] <jeremyckahn> It's only an issue if you have some crazy huge DOM, or the user is on an old IE.
[00:41:47] <Prot> probably not worth the effort
[00:41:51] <jeremyckahn> Ah!
[00:41:58] <jeremyckahn> No, don't use onload.
[00:42:07] <Prot> bad news?
[00:42:19] <Prot> probably doesn't wait for dom load right?
[00:42:22] <jeremyckahn> Well, that's a DOM level 0 event handler.
[00:42:43] <jeremyckahn> That will fire when the HTML loads, essentially.
[01:03:48] <wowtux> hello folks
[01:04:08] <wowtux> how to call multiple call backs in jquery-ui?
[01:04:35] <wowtux> my interest is populate all tabs in jquery-ui tabs object with dinamyc content readed from api analytics
[01:18:32] <sqider> hey guys, is it possible that .find() does not work with the newest version?
[01:19:09] <sqider> i tried this example: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[01:19:23] <sqider> (last example)
[01:19:58] <sqider> even though there is a #content in data, the script wont display it, displaying data itself works fine
[01:49:29] <siovene> Hello. Is there a way I can programmatically insert text into an input field, so that the input thinks the user is typing? (so I get keypress events in that field)
[01:50:55] <siovene> I guess perhaps with .trigger()
[01:51:37] <siovene> Basically I want to put some text in an input, and then trigger a TAB press on that input
[01:52:46] <siovene> note: the TAB is not for focusing purposes. It means something in that particular input.
[02:02:49] <siovene> Oh, like this: e = jQuery.Event("keydown"); e.which = 9; $('my_input').trigger(e); :)
[02:10:17] <siovene> e.keyCode, not e.which.
[02:29:57] <benanne> ew
[02:34:49] <MariusKarthaus> Hi, I have an array of objects. The objects are in fact key-value pairs. How do I best find out if any of the object in my array contains a certain key-value pair
[02:37:49] <href_> Hello my problem is described here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8103843/target-the-same-control-that-initiated-a-jquery-ajax-post-on-postback please let me know if you have any suggestions. Thanks.
[03:08:31] <amanda1919_> is this easy to do?
[03:08:35] <amanda1919_> http://www.professorcloud.com/mainsite/cloud-zoom.htm
[03:33:00] <amanda1919> ok
[03:42:58] <solidus-lake> hey, i'm setting a form field with .val() but then once i click into the form with my user the value gets set to 0
[03:43:01] <solidus-lake> why is this?
[03:44:38] <Woet> ?demo @ solidus-lake
[03:44:38] <bot-t> solidus-lake, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[03:45:08] <solidus-lake> Woet: ?non-disclosure-agreement @ Woet
[03:45:10] <solidus-lake> :P
[03:45:23] <solidus-lake> i could get my ass sued off if i did that
[03:45:52] <solidus-lake> oh, i guess i could do a prototype, i was hoping maybe someone her knew that .val() didn't trigger change or something like that
[03:45:53] <Woet> [12:42:58] <solidus-lake> hey, i'm setting a form field with .val() but then once i click into the form with my user the value gets set to 0
[03:46:00] <Woet> and you think that's enough info?
[03:46:56] <solidus-lake> I have a form field (input.textarea) that i set the value of with .val("some string") i have a live event bound to the change method of that field which does not get triggered. And then when i click into the mouse with my cursor the value gets set back to "" as though it were never set
[03:47:05] <Woet> solidus-lake: and a NDA is to protect unique parts/corporate info/intellectual property
[03:47:14] <Woet> solidus-lake: not ~ 5 lines of html of a form and some javascript
[03:47:25] <solidus-lake> I think it has something to do with having a "hint" value
[03:47:36] <Woet> solidus-lake: please provide a demo or provide a prototype.
[03:54:43] <solidus-lake> Woet: thanks for bieng aptient with me, i think i found a way around the problem, but i'll prepare prototypes for further questions, this one isn't around any part of code though. What event gets triggered when "enter" is hit in an input tag? do i just use keydown and keyup events and check for the return key?
[03:55:41] <Woet> solidus-lake: for a textarea, keyup / keydown indeed
[03:59:41] <rndm_> hej people - is there a nice plugin that sets up some random intervals and timings with ranges?
[04:00:15] <rndm_> I want an API like $(selector).superawesomerandomthingy(min, max, function(){});
[04:00:30] <rndm_> and it to handle that the interval to cron this function will be awesome
[04:00:44] <Putr> hi! Is there a plugin that does this http://bit.ly/bWrbTz but is easyer to use/newer/more popular
[04:01:05] <rndm_> and ensure that the previous function called has ended (so it the function itself takes an animation of 5000, then it won't schedule before that) that is an option, you can always check the numbers yourself
[04:01:20] <solidus-lake> how do i check for which event triggered a function
[04:01:29] <solidus-lake> if (event.type = "keyup")
[04:01:32] <solidus-lake> ?
[04:01:41] <solidus-lake> well, that but with the == not=
[04:01:52] <rndm_> !=
[04:01:53] <rndm_> ?
[04:02:13] <rndm_> ah, ok, forget, I understood
[04:02:15] <solidus-lake> so if i wanted to check if the trigger was a keyup, would it be event.which == "keyup"
[04:02:31] <ravenzz> solidus-lake console.debug(event)
[04:02:40] <ravenzz> you will find the answer
[04:02:41] <ravenzz> :p
[04:11:37] <solidus-lake> ravenzz: got it!
[04:51:36] <solidus-lake> thanks for the help all
[04:51:40] <solidus-lake> 'night!
[05:15:58] <Thomas`-> Hey all, is this channel for jquery ui help also?
[05:30:08] <olarf> hi.. i've got a small question about creating a website these days
[05:31:32] <olarf> when i am writing my markup is it the right way to just put all my content in the "index.html" into different <div>-tags which are simply "hidden" when the page first is loadet and then i just change them to visible if the user interacts with the page
[05:32:20] <olarf> or should i load some content via the (ajax/jquery)-"load"?
[05:33:08] <SoulRaven> is it posible to check if a document is xml or something else?
[05:33:38] <SoulRaven> i have an ajax response and i want to check if the response is xml or something else
[05:34:41] <dw> SoulRaven: can you examine the returned Content-type?
[05:34:49] <dw> otherwise you have to do some kind of sniffing, which always gets ugly
[05:35:08] <SoulRaven> i am ussing $.ajax
[05:35:26] <dw> you can use .getResponseHeader('Content-type') == 'text/xml' the
[05:35:31] <dw> *then. assuming the server is well behaved
[05:36:35] <olarf> SoulRaven: i am not much into JQuery but if you can read the file you could use jQuery string operations (contains) to parse the first line of the file
[05:36:48] <dw> yeah, please don't do that :)
[05:36:54] <olarf> ^^
[05:37:22] <olarf> <== comming from other languages hehe
[05:37:25] <dw> then the question becomes, is the first line a preprocessing directive or the xml root node, or perhaps a cmoment block? :)
[05:37:51] <olarf> i would parse until i get a type ^^
[05:38:02] <olarf> but lets forget about this
[05:38:04] <olarf> :)
[05:38:08] <dw> hehe yep
[05:38:32] <olarf> can you possibly give me an idea about my question?
[05:39:10] <dw> olarf: there are a million templating systems. i prefer to do what you suggested, and use jQuery operations to populate the template, but a lot of people don't like this
[05:40:15] <olarf> what do you mean by populate? load content dynamicaly? or just to make divs visible?
[05:58:40] <SoulRaven> dw; how i het getAllResponseHeaders() from $.ajax ?
[06:00:20] <SoulRaven> if i do: var responseXML = $.ajax(); console.log(responseXML.responseXML); i get nothing
[06:01:29] <SoulRaven> if i do: var responseXML = $.ajax(); console.log(responseXML.getAllResponseHeaders()); i get nothing
[06:05:47] <piioll> hey
[06:06:35] <piioll> hello
[06:07:02] <piioll> i just wanted to ask is each version of jquery independant of one another
[06:08:28] <erichynds> what?
[06:08:51] <erichynds> SoulRaven: $.ajax().responseXML
[06:08:56] <piioll> versions 1.3.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6 etc
[06:09:23] <erichynds> what do you mean if they are independent of each other
[06:09:30] <SoulRaven> erichynds: i don't undestand
[06:10:00] <piioll> so if there are errors in 1.4 will they be in 1.6, i know its a silly question
[06:10:29] <piioll> is it a complete re-write of the code
[06:10:30] <erichynds> depends on the ticket.. bugs usually demand new versions
[06:10:50] <erichynds> SoulRaven: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jqXHR
[06:10:57] <piioll> so does that mean its a complete re-write or just that particular bug is fixed
[06:11:19] <erichynds> depends. 1.5 had a complete rewrite of the ajax piece
[06:11:26] <erichynds> but the entire thing isn't rewritten on each new version
[06:11:29] <erichynds> that would be silly
[06:11:29] <piioll> right ok,
[06:12:02] <piioll> nice one thanx for clearing it up
[06:12:43] <piioll> from a security perspective would it be ideal for someone to upgrade to the latest version of jquery
[06:12:58] <piioll> if say, they are running 1.4.4
[06:13:41] <erichynds> you'd have to go through the changelog and see if any tickets were closed that involved security
[06:13:49] <erichynds> might have been a couple to avoid XSS attacks or something.
[06:14:05] <SoulRaven> erichynds: http://jsfiddle.net/GEU2h/1/
[06:14:10] <SoulRaven> is not working
[06:14:29] <piioll> but if you upgrade to 1.6.2 you have a attack vector
[06:14:37] <piioll> for XSS
[06:15:35] <erichynds> SoulRaven: that's not how ajax works
[06:15:47] <erichynds> ?ajax101 @ SoulRaven
[06:15:47] <bot-t> SoulRaven, Please reference the AJAX 101 diagram: http://i41.tinypic.com/etsbyo.png and these slides: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide41
[06:15:56] <erichynds> oh, you set async to false
[06:15:58] <erichynds> yikes
[06:16:25] <dw> SoulRaven: you must for it to complete
[06:17:00] <dw> $.ajax({ ...}).done(function(xhr) { if(xhr.getResponseHeader('Content-type') == 'text/xml') { ... } else { alert('yoiks! 69'); } });
[06:17:04] <dw> or something
[06:17:27] <erichynds> SoulRaven: you want to log getResponseHeaders(), note the ()
[06:17:32] <erichynds> otherwise you're just logging the function itself
[06:20:05] <jammsen> hi guys, is it possible to only call an interval when then users looks at my page? when he switch tab, the interval should stop, and at looking start again
[06:23:46] <SoulRaven> dw: http://jsfiddle.net/GEU2h/2/
[06:23:59] <SoulRaven> is corect like this? because is not working :(
[06:25:22] <m_tadeu> hi...I have a <div><table>, and when I remove a row, the table and div resizes automaticaly, but without animation....how can I animate this resize?
[06:25:49] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: Uncaught TypeError: Object # has no method 'getResponseHeader'
[06:26:18] <Manuel`AC> Don't you have a real testcase?
[06:27:06] <jammsen> hi guys, is it possible to only call an interval when then users looks at my page? when he switch tab, the interval should stop, and at looking start again
[06:27:06] <SoulRaven> functional test case no, only that function, i a part from a mvc
[06:27:29] <Manuel`AC> Not that I'm aware of jammsen. Why would you want this anyway?
[06:28:13] <erichynds> SoulRaven: http://jsfiddle.net/ehynds/GEU2h/4/
[06:28:14] <Manuel`AC> Ok SoulRaven. Btw, why did you disable the async part of AJAX?
[06:28:20] <erichynds> SoulRaven: also, use async ajax
[06:28:25] <erichynds> ?async @ SoulRaven
[06:28:26] <bot-t> SoulRaven, NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[06:28:31] <jammsen> Manuel`AC: because the browser memory explodes, when the user dont look at it, sometimes they have to restart it, setinterval 3 seconds
[06:29:14] <Manuel`AC> jammsen, then you're doing something wrong.
[06:29:40] <jammsen> Manuel`AC: thats why im asking, any idea?
[06:30:12] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: i have set the disable because i don't know how to callback the function when the request is done
[06:31:08] <Manuel`AC> There is no event for that jammsen.
[06:31:12] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: Any examples?
[06:31:26] <Manuel`AC> (of what you need to call when the request is finished)
[06:32:18] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: i want to return true and populate a variabile with the response from the ajax call
[06:32:54] <piioll> is there a way of checking all the bugs, that were ever inherit with jquery (ie version 1.0 - 1.6.4)
[06:33:19] <jammsen> Manuel`AC: http://77.20.38.48:81/rconcake/
[06:33:24] <jammsen> thats my side
[06:33:26] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: Clear, but what do these variables contain and are they really necessary for the app to start?
[06:33:39] <jammsen> the refresh is an interval on 3 seconds
[06:33:53] <jammsen> maybe to much data for the browser to handle?
[06:34:40] <Manuel`AC> jammsen: There are better ways of doing this. Comet :)
[06:34:54] <jammsen> what do you mean?
[06:35:24] <piioll> a secuirty tool that will check for bugs (ie XSS) for jquery
[06:35:24] <jwm> it'd be nice to have a release notes link
[06:35:28] <Manuel`AC> a.k.a: Reverse AJAX, HTTP Streaming, HTTP server push among others
[06:35:34] <jwm> right underneath the download button
[06:36:23] <Manuel`AC> all you need for reverse AJAX to work is a dedicated / VPS where you can install stuff on
[06:37:00] <Manuel`AC> jammsen: Btw, Firefox 7.0.1 cancels all XHR-requests if I switch tabs. Take a look with Firebug if you want
[06:37:26] <jwm> firefox is buggy :/
[06:37:35] <jammsen> but where comes the memory overcrash`?
[06:37:42] <jwm> mouseenter/mouseleave on 7 isn't working for me right
[06:37:51] <jwm> again
[06:38:12] <Manuel`AC> Can you describe this bug jammsen? How long does it take for this bug to show
[06:39:18] <Manuel`AC> Btw, if I were you I'd switch from HTML to JSON. Every request eats up about 7.8KB depending on the state and you keep replacing the content
[06:39:41] <jwm> I love json
[06:39:47] <Manuel`AC> Who doesn't :)
[06:40:31] <Manuel`AC> 60 requests and all of them are XHR almost use up 500KB!
[06:40:47] <jwm> ouch
[06:41:30] <Manuel`AC> jammsen: I suppose you're using PHP?
[06:41:43] <jammsen> Manuel`AC: do you have a good tutor for reverse ajax /comet on your hand?
[06:41:49] <jammsen> Manuel`AC: thats right :)
[06:42:07] <Manuel`AC> jammsen: Please try it with JSON first :)
[06:42:34] <jammsen> Manuel`AC: @bug it has appeard after one hour idle at a friend
[06:42:34] <piioll> ne1? re:a secuirty tool that will check for bugs (ie XSS) ONLY for jquery
[06:43:08] <Manuel`AC> jammsen: Let me give you some JSON examples and how to parse them with the help of jQuery
[06:43:38] <piioll> ...
[06:44:00] <jammsen> Manuel`AC: i would love to get links to both :)
[06:44:11] <jammsen> comet and json
[06:44:12] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: is any solution to populate the variabile using async ajax, only when the data are avalibile from the request?
[06:45:23] <Manuel`AC> You could always append the data when the request is done. If you need the data when the page is being loaded then you need to change your approach
[06:46:33] <ldelossantos> hi
[06:46:55] <Manuel`AC> Almost done jammsen :)
[06:47:06] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: something like this, to have the data when the page is loaded or jquery ui tabs is visibile
[06:47:30] <jammsen> Manuel`AC: nice, but i have a question to comet, how do the webserver requests new data? cronjob?
[06:47:34] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: Any example?
[06:47:48] <jammsen> i mean i do fsockopen to a game server :o
[06:47:57] <Manuel`AC> jammsen, no, by polling. It keeps the connection open until there is new information available
[06:48:13] <Manuel`AC> There are more efficient methods like websockets (html5) but still
[06:48:28] <ldelossantos> anyone can give me a little help? I looking for a wait to execute some method after a jquery ui event execution.
[06:48:31] <Manuel`AC> Let's learn how to crawl before we learn how to run
[06:49:10] <jammsen> the client o server, yeah
[06:49:25] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: no example, if is posibile to give me at least an ideea or something
[06:49:31] <jammsen> but my server has to know an interval to get new data from the game server?
[06:50:28] <Manuel`AC> jammsen: http://www.pastie.org/2852377 - PHP example how to output JSON
[06:52:42] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: What I usually do if the data is really necessary include it on the top of the page inside the <head>-element. For example: http://www.pastie.org/2852390
[06:52:58] <Manuel`AC> s/necessary/necessary,
[06:53:21] <jammsen> Manuel`AC: so i have to generate the table for view in the client?
[06:53:31] <Manuel`AC> Correct jammsen! :)
[06:53:54] <jammsen> but i need stil an interval for the check right?
[06:54:06] <Manuel`AC> Also check if the objects are different before changing the content
[06:54:11] <Manuel`AC> That's no problem now jammsen
[06:54:31] <jammsen> Manuel`AC: smaller data you mean?
[06:54:40] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: and is not posibile to check when the ajax requeste is done, and after that to populate the variabile?
[06:54:59] <Manuel`AC> jammsen: yes
[06:55:02] <jammsen> Manuel`AC: but wouldn't be the reverse ajax make here more sense?
[06:55:05] <Manuel`AC> It makes it a lot easier for the browser
[06:55:11] <SoulRaven> something like: $.ajax().allfinish()
[06:55:12] <ldelossantos> Hi, sorry. Anyone know a jquery or javascript way to execute a method After a jquery event execution? I know it's sounds crazy, but i have a droppable / draggable implementation in wich i need to remove dom elements, and is rasing an exception becouse im removing dom inside drop event
[06:55:33] <Manuel`AC> Yeah jammsen, but like I said before: first you need to learn how to crawl and walk before you can start learning on how to run
[06:55:57] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: After all the AJAX requests are finished?
[06:56:18] <jammsen> Manuel`AC: i only want to make it right and experience rich :D
[06:56:19] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: yes
[06:56:45] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: yes, i think in this manner i have the data from ajax to return from the function
[06:56:45] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: Then you need to create a wrapper around $.ajax to check if there are any requests left to do
[06:57:08] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: Can't you really give me a link to the application we're talking about? Or at least a test case
[06:57:40] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: only the code, the aplication for the moment runs localy
[06:57:54] <ldelossantos> Manuel`AC: Sorry, maybe i wrong but in 1.7 you have the callback object and defered... I think this do the $.ajax().allFinish() thing
[06:58:04] <Manuel`AC> Will do as well
[06:58:44] <Manuel`AC> Ah, don't know about that ldelossantos. Haven't tested 1.7 yet
[06:58:51] <ldelossantos> jQuery.when()
[06:58:54] <ldelossantos> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[06:59:00] <ldelossantos> look the sample...
[06:59:06] <ldelossantos> $.when( $.ajax("test.aspx") ).then(function(ajaxArgs){
[06:59:06] <ldelossantos>      alert(ajaxArgs[1]); /* ajaxArgs is [ "success", statusText, jqXHR ] */
[06:59:06] <ldelossantos> });
[06:59:22] <SoulRaven> http://pastebin.com/Jtw19FVV
[06:59:25] <ldelossantos> you have a $.when(defered...) and .then -> wherever...
[06:59:49] <Manuel`AC> Thanks for the tip ldelossantos
[07:00:00] <Manuel`AC> I'll dive into it :)
[07:00:21] <piioll> any jquery security experts
[07:00:25] <piioll> oln here
[07:01:14] <ldelossantos> and with 1.7 i think $.when() parameter can be any deferred, and i not sure but for defered you have the $.callback(), so you can chain anything you want.. (maybe i really wrong and i understand everything bad)
[07:03:34] <Manuel`AC> I think you're right ldelossantos
[07:04:25] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: Why don't create an anonymous function that puts the markers on the map when it's done loading?
[07:05:34] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: i don't want the map to be empty on the first call
[07:08:20] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: Give me a sec, I think we can handle this async without altering lots of code :)
[07:11:53] <ldelossantos> bye! Good look! I have to work a little more!
[07:11:58] <SoulRaven> :)
[07:12:34] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: http://www.pastie.org/2852483
[07:14:16] <Manuel`AC> Let's compare mine with yours: http://www.pastie.org/2852490
[07:14:36] <SoulRaven> ok.....
[07:14:37] <TheDragoon> Good afternoon!
[07:14:50] <Manuel`AC> Good afternoon, TheDragoon
[07:16:31] <TheDragoon> I'm new to jQuery. But I am trying to create a custom class with instances like I want to make a class called Person, then add functions to that Person. so I can create an instance like var Person1 = new Person("Bob"). But I can
[07:16:56] <TheDragoon> But everytime I try it is wrong...
[07:17:15] <Manuel`AC> Javascript doesn't have classes
[07:17:30] <piioll> hello anyone does anyone have the answer to my question
[07:17:39] <Manuel`AC> We have functions that can act like classes
[07:18:14] <TheDragoon> Okay Manuel`AC, but how can I create the same "scenario" then?
[07:18:37] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: in fact i call de reloadmarkers from the success argument
[07:19:13] <piioll> jquery security: anyone
[07:20:00] <Manuel`AC> TheDragoon: http://www.pastie.org/2852516
[07:21:20] <TheDragoon> Hmmz okey. I'll try that! Thanks Manuel`AC !
[07:21:20] <Manuel`AC> TheDragoon: I can recommend you to read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11246/best-resources-to-learn-javascript
[07:21:43] <Manuel`AC> Sure, no problem. Have fun
[07:21:54] <TheDragoon> Thanks again! :) Manuel`AC
[07:22:25] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: Yes, but now it's async
[07:23:32] <SoulRaven> thx, i will try
[07:28:34] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: i have done like this and is working: http://www.pastie.org/2852544
[07:28:44] <grid_> hey
[07:28:53] <grid_> is it a bad idea to use yui and jquery in a webpage? they both control different scripts
[07:29:16] <Manuel`AC> grid_: Never use multiple frameworks on one page
[07:29:23] <Manuel`AC> (best practice)
[07:29:44] <Manuel`AC> Either choose YUI or jQuery, not both :)
[07:30:03] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: :) Everything is going async right now?
[07:31:03] <SoulRaven> yes, is async and i have the data on the first call
[07:31:10] <Manuel`AC> Sweet
[07:31:11] <jwm> grid_: it should be fine
[07:31:28] <SoulRaven> solution is a little strange for me, but is working
[07:32:16] <Manuel`AC> The use of an anonymous function you mean?
[07:32:18] <grid_> jwm: since i get bugs with jquery ui dialog i have to use yui dialog, it has containment and it will not bug with ie
[07:32:48] <SoulRaven> no, to call the anonymus function from the success
[07:32:55] <jwm> grid_: hmm I was about to start using dialog
[07:32:58] <jwm> what bugs do you get
[07:33:01] <Manuel`AC> Btw SoulRaven, you can remove the 'complete' function and put the contents of that into 'success'
[07:33:35] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: is more fine like this?
[07:33:47] <Manuel`AC> Then you can skip the if-statement
[07:34:14] <grid_> jwm: it will not show some icons with ie, it's not only that but also features that it not has, like autocenter etc
[07:34:29] <SoulRaven> i still want to ckeck is the response is xml, using the requesteheader, so i thing i will put in done()
[07:34:46] <Manuel`AC> SoulRaven: dataType: "xml",
[07:34:53] <Manuel`AC> Why double check?
[07:35:06] <grid_> atleast it will not autocenter on resize by default, sure i could tweak that, but it doesn't have containment at all
[07:37:55] <bfred> I need to create a custom event ('trans-end') that should map to ('webkitTransitionEnd transitionend ...'), any pointers?
[07:38:51] <bfred> basically, the event 'trans-end' should fire every time either webkitTransitionEnd or transitionend are triggered, on any element
[07:38:53] <Monir> Can anyone suggest me a good slideshow jquery plugin?
[07:41:20] <SoulRaven> Manuel`AC: thx, is working fine now, thx
[07:41:31] <Manuel`AC> No problem SoulRaven
[07:42:20] <pilloo> hello
[07:42:35] <pilloo> anyone let me know about jquery security
[07:42:45] <Monir> ?
[07:43:13] <pilloo> any jquery security experts
[07:43:37] <Monir> hey pilloo
[07:45:39] <pilloo> hey man
[07:47:28] <pilloo> hello??
[07:48:21] <pilloo> hello monir
[07:48:34] <Manuel`AC> pilloo: * Monir (~Monir@79.134.147.15) Quit (Quit: ~ Trillian Astra - www.trillian.im ~)
[07:48:51] <pilloo> ??
[07:49:04] <Manuel`AC> He left so he won't give you a reply
[07:49:15] <Manuel`AC> Just so you know
[07:49:33] <pilloo> o rite kool
[07:49:44] <pilloo> thanx for letting me know Manuel AC
[07:49:50] <Manuel`AC> Sure, np
[07:49:55] <pilloo> can you help with my jquery security issues
[07:50:02] <Manuel`AC> No sorry pilloo
[07:50:09] <pilloo> oh ok
[07:50:31] <pilloo> do you what avenues i can take to get to it
[07:51:02] <Woet> pilloo: just asking the channel instead of 1 specific person?
[07:51:31] <pilloo> well the channel but no one seems to know / be intertested
[07:51:48] <Woet> pilloo: what is your actual question?
[07:51:52] <Manuel`AC> You're still asking for a XSS-injection tool?
[07:51:55] <pilloo> right,
[07:52:08] <Manuel`AC> an XSS*
[07:52:12] <bfred> cross-browser CSS transition-end event, any way to improve it? http://jsfiddle.net/rGECn/1/
[07:52:34] <Manuel`AC> Can't help you with that pilloo
[07:52:42] <pilloo> i am trying to find out if it possible to get a tool that identifies jquery issues like a security tool that find jquery vulns ONLY
[07:53:29] <pilloo> im askign the room as woet suggested
[07:53:39] <pilloo> thanx manuel AC
[07:53:57] <Woet> pilloo: how can jquery possibly have vulnerabilities?
[07:54:38] <pilloo> bugs
[07:54:47] <Woet> pilloo: bugs != security vulnerabilities
[07:54:53] <pilloo> ok
[07:55:08] <pilloo> i originially said issues but no one replied
[07:55:14] <pilloo> and bugs
[07:55:19] <Woet> .. so you want a tool that scans for bugs?
[07:55:28] <pilloo> so i thought id try something different
[07:55:30] <pilloo> yes
[07:55:47] <Woet> if such a tool was possible, wouldn't that mean everything in the world is bug free?
[07:59:09] <Woet> pilloo: the closest you could get to is www.jslint.com
[08:08:14] <ericandrewlewis> this looks right, right? jQuery("<tr><td>newimagehere</td><Td></td></tr>").insertBefore('#add-new-images-tr');
[08:08:37] <ericandrewlewis> it's not inserting the new tr element…or not showing it
[08:08:48] <Woet> ericandrewlewis: is it tabular data?
[08:08:51] <ericandrewlewis> yes
[08:09:05] <iman> I want to apply an effect on all of the <td> in spec table that has specific id, how can I access to all <td> from a certain table
[08:09:34] <pilloo> thanx Woet just checking it now
[08:09:50] <ericandrewlewis> iman: $("table#your_table_id td).each( function(i, el ) { //do stuff } );
[08:10:04] <iman> ericandrewlewis, so appreciate man
[08:10:30] <ericandrewlewis> Woet: is there something i have to do special with tabular data in this situation?
[08:10:39] <Woet> ?demo @ ericandrewlewis
[08:10:39] <bot-t> ericandrewlewis, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[08:10:43] <pilloo> RE your comment<Woet> if such a tool was possible, wouldn't that mean everything in the world is bug free?
[08:11:06] <pilloo> not necessarily as this could let bad people take advantage of them
[08:11:14] <pilloo> so the world would NOT be bug free
[08:11:44] <pilloo> nothing is bug free
[08:11:56] <Woet> pilloo: indeed, hence im wondering why you want a tool that scans for bugs.
[08:12:06] <Manuel`AC> pilloo: What if the tool you're checking it with marks it as a bug while in reality it ain't a bug
[08:12:16] <pilloo> for convience and to look for bugs in jquery
[08:12:37] <pilloo> then you would mnaully check it wouldnt you ;)
[08:12:52] <Manuel`AC> pilloo: They discover bugs by functional testing
[08:13:02] <pilloo> hence you would not get bug trackeers
[08:13:25] <Manuel`AC> We can talk about this all day long, but there are no tools available for such purpose.
[08:13:43] <Manuel`AC> We have unit tests for this kind of purposes
[08:13:47] <pilloo> well, im sure they can be buillt
[08:14:07] <Manuel`AC> Then what's stopping you, hehe
[08:14:44] <pilloo> so how to people find bugs, and why do they report them, i think the problem is with the coding, if the problem was eliminated at the programming stage then we would not find bugs at all
[08:14:56] <pilloo> there is nothing stopping me
[08:15:31] <Manuel`AC> People find bugs by using it in a certain scenario
[08:16:22] <pilloo> ok, but surely there must be sceanrios that query developers test against, then will jquery become bug free
[08:16:27] <Manuel`AC> Every bug has it own way of reproducing. I wish there were standards for finding bugs, but every bug is unique
[08:16:47] <pilloo> true
[08:17:23] <Manuel`AC> You need the community to find them for you
[08:17:39] <pilloo> yes
[08:20:39] <pilloo> this is manual checking, im sure the community can find ways to automate this
[08:20:39] <ericandrewlewis> Woet: I was missing a $() selector in the insertBefore() method :P
[08:21:02] <pilloo> i see your argument about uniqueness tho
[08:21:35] <Woet> pilloo: as Manuel`AC said, it's called unit tests.
[08:21:53] <pilloo> ok
[08:21:53] <Woet> [17:11:44] <pilloo> nothing is bug free
[08:21:54] <Woet> [17:16:22] <pilloo> ok, but surely there must be sceanrios that query developers test against, then will jquery become bug free
[08:21:56] * Woet sighs
[08:22:18] <Manuel`AC> Hehe Woet, couldn't agree more :p
[08:22:30] <pilloo> * pilloo sighs
[08:26:07] <ericandrewlewis> from within an iFrame, how do i select the parent window?
[08:26:25] <TheDragoon> Manuel`AC: I tried it. (http://www.pastie.org/2852787)  But the this.click doesn't work.
[08:27:08] <Manuel`AC> What is the error Firebug (or other client side debug tools) throws?
[08:27:28] <Manuel`AC> Btw, I wouldn't use .click if I were you. Be more specific
[08:27:31] <ericandrewlewis> im trying to select something within the parent hierarchy. something like this $("parent document).($("#title).html("hello") );
[08:27:45] <ericandrewlewis> missed quote -  $("parent document").($("#title).html("hello") );
[08:28:02] <ericandrewlewis> not sure what i would replace parent document with, and i know that syntax is generally wrong.
[08:28:44] <TheDragoon> Hmmz How can I be Manuel`AC ?
[08:28:44] <Manuel`AC> brb :)
[08:28:52] <TheDragoon> oh okay
[08:29:04] <Manuel`AC> TheDragoon: Install Firefox in combination with Firebug, or use Google Chrome / IE9 to debug
[08:29:22] <TheDragoon> Doesn't give an error ;)

[08:30:41] <ericandrewlewis> ah figured it out. forgot i'm within two iframes, dang WordPress
[08:30:45] <ericandrewlewis> jQuery('#add-new-images-tr', window.parent.parent.document).html("HI" );
[08:34:57] <cainus> can anyone tell me what I might be doing wrong with this?  $(document).ready(function(){ $('#imageid').click(function(){console.log("clicked")}) });    I can't seem to get the click handler to run for some unknown reason
[08:35:28] <dabear> cainus: does #imageid exist when document is loaded?
[08:35:29] <cainus> oh and hello BTW :)
[08:35:45] <cainus> dabear: yessir... it's just static html

It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests. These tools allow you to replicate your issue and pres

[08:36:10] <bot-t> cainus, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:36:32] <cainus> I can put a $('#imageid').hide() in the ready handler and it hides it, so I know I'm targetting properly
[08:36:38] <cainus> okay... pasting...
[08:40:30] <cainus> dabear: heh... my minimalist example works in jsfiddler... :\
[08:40:52] <dabear> then go back and find what you did different, cainus
[08:40:59] <cainus> yep.  thanks :)
[08:41:02] <dabear> probably some syntax error, failure to load jquery etc
[08:41:57] <cainus> yeah firebug says nothing of the sort, but I'll build it back up and see where it fails
[08:47:35] <cainus> dabear:  turns out I'm an idiot.  I've got it working now though... Thanks for the help.   ;)
[08:49:41] <dabear> cainus: np, what did you do wrong?
[08:52:59] <cainus> I was testing with a toggle button I had beside beside the image like an idiot :)
[08:53:16] <cainus> no handler on the toggle button at all
[09:04:53] <MaximusColourum> isn't there an issue with including two types of jquery on a page?
[09:07:56] <MaximusColourum> jquery-1.3.1.min.js and 1.6.2/jquery.min.js
[09:09:11] <VeXii> why do you wanner do that?
[09:15:06] <jwm> anyone have an url of the multiple box effect
[09:15:16] <jwm> where multiple boxes fade in
[09:15:22] <jwm> I know I could code it but I just feel like stealing atm
[09:25:50] <PhonicUK> <3 .animate on the background color of the body :D
[09:53:03] <zkirill> I need to load a local JSON file into a script tag. Should I be using $.getJSON?
[09:53:54] <iman> Has JQuery any css style for vertical bar ?
[10:17:26] <soee> hi, is it possible to have div always x pixels from the top of the page (when scroll page) and this div inside other div (so i can position it relative to the container horizontaly) ?
[10:32:30] <Chani> is there any equivalent to slideUp() for showing items?
[10:32:49] <Chani> I don't see anything in hte documentation. it seems kinda odd that it's one-way
[10:33:30] <Chani> wuh.. it's there now.
[10:33:30] <Chani> o.0
[10:33:39] <Chani> I swear it wasn't on hte page before :P
[10:33:39] <siovene> Hi, this is definitely off-topic, but can anybody recommend a lightbox sort of plugin that will work fine for very large images (most often larger than the user's screen)?
[10:34:59] <siovene> I've found lots of lightbox plugins, but I'm not sure how they'd work for very large images.
[10:35:21] <eddiemonge> Chani: you mean slideDown?
[10:35:23] <siovene> Basically I'd like to just leave 10px or so around the edges of the window, and display the image in there.
[10:35:51] <eddiemonge> siovene: it might better to open the images in their own new window
[10:36:46] <siovene> eddiemonge: sure, I don't necessarily want to have a popup looking thingy, it's actually better if it's not that way.
[10:38:03] <siovene> eddiemonge: also I wonder if you have any suggestion about what to do when the user doesn't have JS enabled.
[10:38:05] <zkirill> How do I load the JSON data from <script type="application/json" id="content" src="content.json"></script>
[10:38:26] <zkirill> I thought it was $('#content').html() but that returns empty
[10:38:28] <eddiemonge> siovene: thats why i said have the image open in its own window. using a norma anchor tag
[10:38:58] <eddiemonge> ?getjson @ zkirill
[10:38:58] <bot-t> zkirill, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[10:39:26] <zkirill> eddimonge: I'm trying not to use that
[10:39:37] <zkirill> but thanks :)
[10:51:23] <N3w8ee> Hey you know how there's "mobilization cost" which is a downpayment for a project ... what do you guys use as the equivalent to this term in software projects?
[10:59:39] <bonhoffer> i'm wrestling with: Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function
[11:00:00] <bonhoffer> i do have jquery defined  -- trying to troubleshoot
[11:01:56] <xnotte> i can't understand why my function doesnt make div scroll http://jsfiddle.net/DKCjv/
[11:06:14] <xnotte> found the error
[11:06:30] <tariktarik1907> hi folks!
[11:06:46] <Chani> hrm. if I have <div id='foo'>bar</div> then $('#foo').html() returns 'bar'. is there any function that'll return the whole thing?
[11:08:55] <Rembane> Chani: Do you want it in plain text?
[11:09:14] <Chani> yeah, I guess
[11:09:21] <Chani> I want to copy the html into another document
[11:09:36] <Rembane> Chani: Why not just use $('#foo') ?
[11:09:42] <Chani> I *could* redo the outer tag manually, but I'd rather not :)
[11:09:57] <Chani> Rembane: because I didn't know I could :)
[11:10:35] * Chani doesn't really undererstand what $('#foo') returns. I've been treating it as a magic object
[11:11:02] <Rembane> Chani: ^^
[11:11:31] <tariktarik1907> I'm doing ajax request with $.ajax(), i want to execute code after that ajax responsed
[11:11:39] <Rembane> Chani: It returns one or more parts of the HTML DOM when used in that way, you can also use it to generate HTML, like this: $('<ul>');
[11:12:28] <Rembane> tariktarik1907: http://dpaste.com/655244/
[11:12:52] <tariktarik1907> I know that, but there is something wrong
[11:12:57] <tariktarik1907> can I show it on private room?
[11:13:01] <Chani> I guess I've never really grokked the DOM
[11:13:03] <Chani> neat.
[11:13:05] <Rembane> tariktarik1907: Preferably not.
[11:13:13] <Rembane> Chani: :)
[11:13:22] <eddiemonge> Chani: what do you mean copy it into another document?
[11:13:40] <soee> i have div positioned absolute, top: 120 but offset() always returns 27 any idea why ?
[11:13:49] <soee> *offset().top
[11:14:00] <Chani> eddiemonge: well, I have some code that displays results in a pretty table, and I want to take some snapshots of that table and save them and make a pretty report from them
[11:14:55] <eddiemonge> Chani: seems like something your backend server would be doing
[11:15:58] <eddiemonge> soee: do you have example code or a link?
[11:16:23] <Chani> well, I have no server; really this ought to be a desktop program, but I wanted an excuse to learn jquery.
[11:17:31] <eddiemonge> soee: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/XMF7M/
[11:18:02] <eddiemonge> Chani: how are you going to make a report from them? just use the browsers normal print button?
[11:22:44] <Chani> eddiemonge: window.open() and document.write()
[11:23:04] * Chani discoveres clone() and starts reading
[11:24:16] <bonhoffer> why type of things cause: " Uncaught TypeError: Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function"
[11:24:46] <bonhoffer> my stack trace goes into jquery.js, so it is not like it isn't loading
[11:25:08] <bonhoffer> i'm just not understanding the error or what's causing it
[11:27:03] <bonhoffer> $('#article_page_id').hover is generating the error
[11:27:31] <bonhoffer> maybe i'm using the wrong version of jquery?
[11:27:53] <bonhoffer> what is the source for the latest?
[11:28:15] <bonhoffer> jQuery JavaScript Library v1.6.2 is what i have
[11:29:35] <Chani> bonhoffer: maybe you have some other code that's interfering with jquery?
[11:29:58] <bonhoffer> Chani, i would think that is the most likely scenario
[11:30:03] <bonhoffer> but i'm not sure how to find it
[11:30:31] <bonhoffer> i'm eliminating includes and seeing if i can get it to go away
[11:31:12] <ravenzz> do you have a demo?
[11:31:16] <bonhoffer> then i'll re-introduce
[11:31:25] <bonhoffer> i do -- but i need to push to it
[11:31:32] <Chani> goddamnit, if I try to use appendTo(mywindow.document) it does nothing :(
[11:31:54] <ravenzz> append to the body instead
[11:32:01] <Chani> oh. riiight.
[11:32:05] <Chani> :)
[11:33:07] <Chani> ravenzz: wait, how do I select the body of a different document?
[11:33:33] <Chani> $('body') will operate on document, not mywindow.document
[11:33:57] <ravenzz> whould you control another page from the current one?
[11:35:56] <Chani> huh?
[11:36:04] <Chani> hmm, maybe the context parameter will help
[11:36:04] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do? :p
[11:36:48] <Chani> ravenzz: see above, I've been trying to copy a table into another document, to get a few snapshots of it
[11:38:12] <Chani> woo! I think it worked :)
[11:39:30] <shesek> Chani, $('body', otherwindow.document)
[11:39:50] <shesek> or $(otherwindow.document).find('body') (which is slightly faster)
[11:41:28] <Chani> why is that faster? :)
[11:43:38] <eddiemonge> because it is
[11:44:06] <eddiemonge> bonhoffer: 1.7 is the latest
[11:56:03] * puppen misses jQuery ever so much
[12:05:58] <defendguin1> anyone have a good idea of how i am supposed to be doing the binding of events using jquery mobile (don't say go to #jquerymobile because no one there answers)  apparently the dom ready thing is different and i'm advised to put everything in different js files but something isn't working right
[12:06:27] <defendguin1> no good concrete examples in jquery mobile docs
[12:07:42] <__seth> hey i'm a noob with jquery ....is there a simple way to do string replacement i.e. ' I am a {0} String'.replace('cool')
[12:14:44] <plainas> http://jsfiddle.net/yfzFw/1/ <-- why doesn't the show('1500') animation visible in this snippet?
[12:15:04] <shesek> __seth, 'foo'.replace(/foo/g, 'bar')... but what does that have to do with jQuery?
[12:15:36] <abjorn> Coldhead, I have a game premise I'm working on, what do you think?  The year is 1901. Thomas Edison botches an experiment and releases the zombie scourge upon the world. The only man who can stop it is Nikola Tesla. With his fists.
[12:16:47] <bonhoffer> ravenzz, ok i have a demo up
[12:17:07] <bonhoffer> http://fitwit.herokuapp.com/ sorry it is slow
[12:17:14] <__seth> @shesek i was hoping there was something built into jquery like YUI does...they have a string substitution that makes it more readabile.... right now i just extend the String prototype ...but i guess that will work
[12:18:25] <bonhoffer> Property '$' of object [object DOMWindow] is not a function
[12:18:46] <bonhoffer> really a head scratcher for me
[12:19:24] <bonhoffer> i can't see what is interfering
[12:19:45] <pablo747> !ciao
[12:19:57] <pablo747> !lista
[12:20:08] <bonhoffer> i'm loading jquery-1.7.min.js then just calling: $('#article_page_id').hover( and getting an error
[12:21:24] <shesek> __seth, take a look at microtemplatez <https://github.com/addyosmani/microtemplatez>
[12:21:59] <shesek> templatez('foo {bar} baz', {bar: 'qux'})
[12:22:08] <bonhoffer> Chani, any thoughts -- or troubleshooting ideas
[12:22:22] <__seth> shesek, ahhh cool thanks!
[12:22:49] <shesek> bonhoffer, can you pastebin your code?
[12:24:47] <bonhoffer> shesek, anything . . . but what code do you want? the page source as rendered
[12:25:04] <bonhoffer> do you want code that isn't visible on the demo
[12:25:27] <shesek> the relevant client-side code that causes the error
[12:25:40] <shesek> if possible, try to reproduce it on jsfiddle
[12:28:53] <bonhoffer> shesek, i can try -- i stripped down all the extra javascript to what is on: http://fitwit.herokuapp.com/
[12:29:06] <Chani> bonhoffer: jsfiddle.net is awesme. :)
[12:29:17] <bonhoffer> but i could pull those files over jsfiddle.net is awesome --i've used it before
[12:29:20] <bonhoffer> i'll move the files there
[12:31:32] <shesek> bonhoffer, seems like some code is unsetting $ (or jQuery.noConflict is called)
[12:31:54] <bonhoffer> http://jsfiddle.net/fNL5B/
[12:32:01] <bonhoffer> but i'm not able to duplicate the error
[12:32:05] <shesek> Wrap your code in (function($){ /* your code here */ })(jQuery) to make sure $ is a reference to jQuery
[12:32:16] <shesek> (which you should always do)
[12:32:28] <bonhoffer> i have so many functions -- but i'll start doing that throughout the code
[12:32:38] <bonhoffer> how can i see errors in jsfiddle
[12:32:51] <GoSox> can I use javascript to make a "thing" that happensevery X seconds?
[12:33:12] <bonhoffer> i thought i would see an error
[12:33:15] <shesek> GoSox, google.com/search?q=mdn+setInterval
[12:33:48] <shesek> bonhoffer, the error is caused by a call to jQuery.noConflict() at line 47 (in your HTML)
[12:34:01] <Prot> Question: is there any shift() or pop() for jquery sets? or should I write my own
[12:34:08] <bonhoffer> shesek, sorry -- two kids on lap -- one sec . . . i have to run -- wow, i am very thankful
[12:34:29] <shesek> jQuery.noConflict() causes jQuery to set $ to its previous value (undefined in your case)
[12:34:58] <shesek> but, again, its always better to make a local $ variable that references jQuery
[12:35:54] <signorblak> !list
[12:36:02] <signorblak> list
[12:36:04] <shesek> Prot, I'm pretty sure you can use Array.prototype's methods directly on jQuery objects
[12:36:04] <signorblak> ao
[12:36:09] <signorblak> !list
[12:36:24] <Prot> shesek: i'll try that out. strange they aren't on the jquery set's prototype
[12:36:26] <shesek> Prot, e.g. var foo = $('foo'); Array.prototype.pop.call(foo)
[12:37:11] <Prot> yep that works great
[12:37:27] <shesek> Prot, you can even do $.fn.pop = Array.prototype.pop
[12:37:36] * foo bows
[12:37:49] <shesek> foo, heh :-)
[12:38:03] <Prot> well i'm thinking if jquery didn't do that, there has to be a reason not to
[12:38:07] <shesek> its not my fault you choose the most common word used for examples as your nickname, tho
[12:38:33] <shesek> Prot, yeah, I'm thinking that too... I'm alt-tabbing between here and a Google search on that
[12:38:42] <Prot> they got splice
[12:38:48] <Prot> probably the only safe one
[12:38:50] <bonhoffer> shesek, ok, i'm back -- so i need to read up on jQuery.noConflict
[12:39:23] <bonhoffer> i am using a team-members code -- no idea why that is there
[12:39:24] <shesek> bonhoffer, it just reverts the '$' variable to its previous value
[12:39:37] <bonhoffer> so it can be reloaded
[12:39:41] <Prot> i never used splice, but it looks like I can use it to do a shift
[12:40:07] <bonhoffer> obviously to prevent a conflict
[12:40:13] <Prot> looks like .shift() equals .splice(0,1)
[12:40:48] <bonhoffer> so noConflict is called after after the javascript include
[12:40:56] <bonhoffer> but i imagine before the DOM is loaded
[12:42:13] <bonhoffer> i need to research why it isn't a problem here: http://e404themes.com/cold/
[12:42:25] <bonhoffer> we bought this template, and they used that in their code
[12:42:51] <bonhoffer> but we are modifying it now . . .
[12:44:55] <bonhoffer> but i can't tell you how much i appreciate your pointing me to the right place
[12:45:05] <bonhoffer> at least i know how to troubleshoot this
[12:45:10] <bonhoffer> it is working
[12:45:58] <shesek> bonhoffer, they're probably either using jQuery instead of $, or make sure to locally assign $ to its correct value
[12:46:10] <shesek> <shesek> Wrap your code in (function($){ /* your code here */ })(jQuery) to make sure $ is a reference to jQuery
[12:46:26] <bonhoffer> no, huge tip -- i'll do that
[13:03:40] <techouse> is there any way to make jquery's animate scale the width of an object from both sides equally not just from left to right?
[13:07:03] <neiz`> Anyone able to assist? http://jsfiddle.net/eYr9Q/ Basically trying to get the height of the parent and assign it to the child.. am able to do it specifically assigning the height in pixels, but cannot get it dynamically
[13:07:59] <techouse> what do you mean? just use .parent()
[13:08:46] <techouse> neiz: http://api.jquery.com/parent/
[13:12:55] <neiz`> techouse, thank you.. was able to get what I wanted with parent()
[13:14:06] <techouse> :)
[13:19:10] <luyang> is jquery good for layout and positioning
[13:19:18] <Iarfen> Hi
[13:19:30] <Iarfen> is there a function to execute the input file element?
[13:20:20] <Rembane> Like run it?
[13:20:40] <Iarfen> Rembane: yes, exactly that
[13:20:59] <Iarfen> Rembane: I'm using .click() (normal javascript) for now, but it seems that it has problems with chrome
[13:21:56] <Rembane> The file fields aren't very scriptable as it is
[13:26:32] <Vaerros> any pointers for getting drag and drop working on iOS 5? I've been using the pbakaus-patched jquery ui to get it working successfully in iOS 4, but not joy for v5
[13:26:34] <Iarfen> Rembane: really, that's very bad....
[13:30:44] <Whirl3d> Good morning all, ajpiano, thanks for the help with registering my nick, it seems they are rejecting gmail registrations or something...
[13:31:45] <Rembane> Iarfen: Indeed.
[13:31:46] <Whirl3d> Does anyone know of a standout high-quality tip plugin?
[13:33:23] <Whirl3d> not lookin' too good, huh? Back to the drawing board.
[13:36:58] <MacDada> "With jQuery 1.7 we built in support for using HTML5 tags in older IEs with methods like .html(). This support is on par with what previously required http://jdbartlett.com/innershiv/. You must still include http://code.google.com/p/html5shiv/ (or Modernizr) in the head of your document in older IEs for HTML5 tag support."
[13:37:07] <MacDada> so what does new jQuery really enable?
[13:38:25] <MacDada> I mean, if html5shiv was to enable use of html5 tags in old IEs and jQuery does that know, why should i still include html5shiv?
[13:40:24] <coldhead> abjorn: that souns very normal
[13:59:36] <tozz> I have an textarea with a class that sets width to 80%, in Firefox width() returns xxx pixels, in Chrome it returns 80 (the percent). Any idea on how to work around this?
[14:06:18] <solars> hey, whats the easiest way to serialize a form into a single form field? I want to store the form contents as a single column in the db. tried $('#content').val = serialize()); where #content is an input field of the form, but it doesnt work with $('form').submit(function() {
[14:15:24] <VeXii> solars: $('#content').val(serialize())
[14:15:43] <ravenz> solars I would do that on the backend-side
[14:15:45] <VeXii> or $("#form").serialize()
[14:16:07] <solars> hm yeah I think backend might be the better place
[14:16:35] <ravenz> it is
[14:16:38] <ravenz> ;)
[14:16:42] <solars> :)
[14:22:29] <mattp_> given x, y coordinates, how can i find what dom elements the mouse is on?
[14:24:21] <Rembane> Where do you get your coordinates from?
[14:24:55] <mattp_> a parent div
[14:25:03] <mattp_> i want to know what elements inside that parent the mouse is on
[14:26:51] <Rembane> You could use hover event instead.
[14:26:55] <Rembane> +the
[14:27:16] <Rembane> Or loop through the elements and check either position() or offset()
[14:51:56] <abjorn> coldhead: I know, not innovative at all
[14:52:53] <GoSox> what's the best function to use to set the content of a <textarea> ? Right now I'm using .val(), but it works in IE7, IE8, but not IE9 strangely.
[14:53:00] <GoSox> and of course, it works fine in real browsers too
[14:55:40] <khmer> GoSox: no reason it shouldn't work in IE9, but you could try .text()
[14:56:05] <GoSox> it kinda makes sense, since textarea's don't have value attributes.
[14:56:24] <GoSox> i just hope I don't have to put a div inside the textarea for loading content.... ill try .text
[14:56:30] <khmer> it does, but jquery accounts for that by deferring to .text() for textareas
[14:56:36] <khmer> which should be working in ie9
[14:57:46] <GoSox> .text() isn't working either, odd
[14:58:13] <sonotos> tried .html()?
[14:59:00] <GoSox> nope, that also doesn't work
[14:59:05] <GoSox> let me see if there are any updates for IE9
[14:59:35] <ravenzz> which version of jQuery do you include?
[15:00:16] <GoSox> it is 1.6.4
[15:00:42] <ravenzz> so try with the 1.7
[15:01:22] <ravenzz> perhaps...
[15:01:44] <GoSox> checking for an IE update first . . .
[15:03:32] <GoSox> i have like 50 windows updates
[15:03:33] <GoSox> i just
[15:03:46] <GoSox>  hope none of these are "upgrading" me to IE10, i will be pissed
[15:04:38] <ravenzz> oh lol, I use to select them by hand
[15:05:03] <GoSox> they all have the same name though
[15:05:11] <ravenzz> I haven't ugrade to ie9 yet
[15:05:12] <GoSox> its all "windows update" or "security update"
[15:05:15] <GoSox> so i just did them all
[15:05:24] <GoSox> this is just a testing VM, i don't "use" windows
[15:05:29] <ravenzz> no probl then
[15:26:01] <Ahrengot> Does the jQuery scroll event send along any arguments with info on the amount scrolled or the distance to the top of the window/container?
[15:37:16] <ryanneuf_> coldhead
[15:41:57] <suncica2222> does some1 knows suitable script or cms for nested comment list, like one on youtube for instance?
[15:43:46] <ryanneufeld_> suncica2222: check out disqus
[15:45:58] <suncica2222> ok
[15:50:08] <GoSox> ravenzz: i just ate dinner, came back, and those updates are still running!
[15:51:48] <ravenzz> ahha anyway they are not going to solve your issue imo
[15:52:03] <GoSox> oh?
[15:52:09] <GoSox> do you know something about it?
[15:52:23] <uiucguy> If anyone can help me identify what an error I'm having is about, it would be greatly appreciated. I'm using fullcalendar, and newly added events are showing up but their eventClick event is not firing. Instead it shows a completely bogus AJAX request in the console that is never even being called
[15:52:32] <uiucguy> no line number and no call stack
[15:53:23] <uiucguy> And when the page is refreshed that same event works fine. It only doesn't work on a newly added event before a page refresh.
[15:53:29] <ravenzz> val() should work
[15:53:52] <uiucguy> Anyone have any experience with an ajax get request firing without you calling it?? Im stumped lol
[15:53:57] <GoSox> ravenzz: do you have access to IE9?
[15:54:05] <ravenzz> uhm no :\
[15:54:17] <GoSox> ok
[15:54:28] <JohnnyDavidson> How come something as simple as this won't work? $.get('http://www.google.com/', function(data){alert(data);});
[15:54:34] <JohnnyDavidson> I'm not getting any errors or anything
[15:55:51] <rpc_> hi there
[15:56:03] <rpc_> i have a quick question:
[15:56:15] <JohnnyDavidson> Anyone?
[15:56:26] <rpc_> does this make any sense? $('button').click(function(){ $(this).click(function(){ $(this).trigger('click') }) })
[15:56:40] <coldhead> ?w same origin policy @ JohnnyDavidson
[15:56:41] <bot-t> JohnnyDavidson, Same origin policy - In computing, the same origin policy is an important security concept for a number of browser-side programming languages, such as JavaScript. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[15:56:45] <JKarsrud> rpc_: no?
[15:56:51] <coldhead> you can't do ajax across domains, JohnnyDavidson
[15:56:58] <rpc_> JKarsrud: right
[15:57:20] <coldhead> an easy fix is to aquire google and host your code at google.com
[15:57:24] <coldhead> acquire*
[15:57:47] <GoSox> coldhead: haha. a *slightly* easier fix would be to have a php doc on your domain that 'gets' what you need gotten, then have ajax get that.
[15:57:56] <JKarsrud> nah
[15:58:06] <JKarsrud> I like coldheads solution better
[15:58:23] <GoSox> do you have a bazillion dollars though?
[15:58:33] <JohnnyDavidson> Okay but it still doesn't work when I get a local file
[15:58:51] <coldhead> a file:/// local file?
[15:58:56] <GoSox> if you aquire google, can you get rid of the IP address thing now? When you google for your IP, the search results page tells you your ip directly. It's stealing traffic from my site :(
[15:58:57] <JohnnyDavidson> Yeah
[15:59:05] <JKarsrud> GoSox: as a matter of fact, yes
[15:59:08] <coldhead> that's not allowed either, JohnnyDavidson
[15:59:08] <JohnnyDavidson> Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[15:59:12] <ravenzz> JohnnyDavidson also there are .error() .complete() methods
[15:59:17] <coldhead> you need to use localhost
[15:59:43] <JohnnyDavidson> I don't have that set up I don't think
[16:09:04] <ChrisPartridge> Can jquery ui's resizable be used on any DOM element, or just jquery UI widgets?
[16:10:04] <JKarsrud> ChrisPartridge: It becomes a resizable widget if you instantiate it on an element
[16:11:51] <ChrisPartridge> JKarsrud: Ah ok, i have a custom jquery ui build - that pretty much only  contains selectable/resizable/draggable - but not getting any resize handle showing, do I need another component?
[16:12:20] <suncica2222> does some1 knows suitable script or cms for nested comment list, like one on youtube for instance?
[16:12:20] <GoSox> ravenzz: just finished :D

[16:36:49] <coldhead> .filter(':gt(0)')
[16:37:53] <SIDU> coldhead: hi~
[16:38:02] <SIDU> coldhead: i tried this: not working :(
[16:38:06] <SIDU> 	$('#dataTable *').live('change',function(){
[16:38:08] <SIDU> 		if (!$(this).parent().hasClass('cbox')) $(this).parents("tr").children().eq(0).children().attr('checked','checked')
[16:38:09] <SIDU> 	});
[16:38:41] <Rembane> indranil: Make an array with all the form elements that have been changed in and submit that array. Use the .change()-event handler to put elements in the array.
[16:39:48] <SIDU> coldhead: any form field updated ,the first td checkbox is checked, except for the first checkbox itself -- other wise never be unchecked
[16:40:09] <coldhead> this sounds very complicated
[16:40:17] <SIDU> :)
[16:40:39] <coldhead> can you put the code on jsfiddle?
[16:40:42] <indranil> Rembane: thanks...
[16:40:46] <coldhead> might be clearer there
[16:41:48] <aniasis> I want to remove a solid color background from an image, essentially making it transparent, is there a plugin for this?
[16:42:32] <GoSox> I can't seem to set the content of a <textarea> using .val(), .text() or .html() - in IE9
[16:42:41] <GoSox> i updated my windows, i updated my jquery to 1.7
[16:42:56] <GoSox> but alas, it won't work in IE9, but it works in every other browser including IE7
[16:43:00] <GoSox> & IE8
[16:43:01] <coldhead> val() should do it
[16:43:06] <GoSox> yeah, but it doesnt
[16:43:11] <GoSox> http://www.whatsmyip.org/changecase/
[16:43:23] <coldhead> i don't have an IE to test with
[16:43:30] <GoSox> oh
[16:43:37] <ChrisPartridge> Chib: thanks - that sorted it
[16:43:42] <Rembane> indranil: np.
[16:43:47] <GoSox> i'm out of ideas to try
[16:43:49] <coldhead> i'm going to do all my IE testing in a few years, so i'm waiting until then
[16:44:31] <Chib> GoSox: is something supposed to be not working on that page you linked?
[16:44:54] <Chib> ah, nm
[16:44:55] <GoSox> yes. In IE9, when you click the button, the text in the big text box dissapears
[16:44:57] <coldhead> so GoSox, this doesn't work in ie9 for you either? http://jsfiddle.net/D38GV/
[16:45:45] <GoSox> that did work actually
[16:46:03] <coldhead> so val() might not be the problem
[16:47:04] <SIDU> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/Rnwjs/
[16:47:25] <Chib> seems like the ajax isn't working
[16:48:17] <SIDU> coldhead: change of the textfield, the checkbox will be checked. however, change the checkbox, should be able to uncheck.
[16:49:30] <sweetgrass> hi, I am trying to make a large table that has been split into column groups, so the user can view one at a time by selecting an option from the drop down. My issue is, how best to make the transitions work - I am hiding and removing a class at the moment but it's clunky. Many thanks in advance.
[16:50:12] <sweetgrass> s/hiding/adding/
[16:51:30] <GoSox> ah so the problem was that IE9 wasn't returning the submit button as part of $)POST
[16:51:34] <GoSox> $_POST i mean
[16:51:42] <SIDU> sweetgrass:  i had this in my project
[16:51:57] <sweetgrass> SIDU: yeah?
[16:52:05] <^zoggy^> [06:41pm] <aniasis> I want to remove a solid color background from an image, essentially making it transparent, is there a plugin for this? -- photoshop? or use imagemasks with flash/php/gd/imagemake
[16:52:24] <SIDU> sweetgrass:  goto : sidu.sf.net the demo page, you can find out, or quick ref here:
[16:52:45] <sweetgrass> SIDU: cool. thanks.
[16:52:46] <SIDU> sweetgrass: in a sec .. i copy the code here for you ..
[16:54:06] <SIDU> sweetgrass: something like this : $('.show').click(function(){$('#'+this.id+'SH').toggle()});
[16:54:50] <Chib> SIDU: your *can* uncheck the checkbox, however it is immediately checked again by your jquery
[16:54:59] <SIDU> sweetgrass:  just this line of code, however you need to figure out. or download sidu.sf.net and play around
[16:55:19] <SIDU> Chib: yeah.
[16:55:27] <sweetgrass> SIDU: ah, toggle. I'll give it a go. Trouble is, toggle is boolean. there's potentially going to be 6 or 7 columns to chose from
[16:55:28] <SIDU> Chib: i try to exlude the checkbox itself.
[16:55:52] <Chib> you haven't in that jsfiddle though
[16:56:00] <coldhead> SIDU: http://jsfiddle.net/Rnwjs/3/
[16:56:09] <SIDU> sweetgrass:  you can id your col, or class your col, or group your col, so you can do at least 3 ways.
[16:56:36] <sweetgrass> SIDU: i'll pastie my code
[16:57:03] <SIDU> coldhead: you are great.! works - thanks !!
[16:57:07] <coldhead> SIDU: i think this is more readable http://jsfiddle.net/Rnwjs/4/
[16:57:22] <coldhead> and it will work better if you ever rearrange the columns
[16:58:20] <SIDU> coldhead: great. glad that there is only on cbox class in each line and it is the first checkbox :D
[16:58:22] <andibirkoff> Hi
[16:59:15] <felipellrocha> hey guys. is there any way i can check if my site's browser window is open using jquery?
[16:59:24] <thomedy> i can grab my event.target html() and print it out
[16:59:31] <thomedy> but i am having a hard time comparing it
[16:59:33] <thomedy> im using
[16:59:50] <thomedy> if($(event.target).html() == ')
[16:59:51] <dabear> felipellrocha: what do you mean?
[16:59:55] <thomedy> 'hsorry too soon
[17:00:07] <thomedy> if($(event.target).html() == 'home')
[17:00:14] <dabear> felipellrocha: if it's in focus, or if it is loaded, or if there is a popup, or what?
[17:00:14] <thomedy> that should work  i think
[17:00:35] <sweetgrass> SIDU: http://jsfiddle.net/wuBKN/1/
[17:01:04] <felipellrocha> dabear: if its on focus. i tried .focus(), but it doesnt trigger when its loaded...
[17:01:43] <felipellrocha> dabear: to be more clear, it doesnt trigger when its loaded and the page is already focused...
[17:02:05] <dabear> felipellrocha: you can get the current active element by doing document.activeElement . However, you cannot tell if one tab/window is in the view or not
[17:03:32] <felipellrocha> dabear: isnt there anyway to do something like $(window).isActive()?
[17:03:42] <felipellrocha> dabear: or something like that...?
[17:04:16] <dabear> felipellrocha: no, and if you have to do that, your are doing something wrong(tm)
[17:05:57] <felipellrocha> dabear: like... im displaying a message to the user... i just want to make sure he read the message.
[17:06:13] <felipellrocha> dabear: before hidding the message, that is...
[17:07:52] <dabear> felipellrocha: http://beakkon.com/tutorial/html5/desktop-notification . you can also prevent the user from closing the current tab with https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
[17:09:08] <SIDU> sweetgrass: http://jsfiddle.net/wuBKN/4/
[17:09:33] <SIDU> sweetgrass: i did a simple example, see if that what you need , if yes, you can improve the js code  then
[17:09:41] <felipellrocha> dabear: thz! ill check it out
[17:10:42] <SIDU> sweetgrass:  oops  try this one : http://jsfiddle.net/wuBKN/6/
[17:12:01] <bonhoffer> i've got some jquery that is not running: https://gist.github.com/1361365
[17:12:13] <SIDU> coldhead:  your code is always better :D
[17:12:35] <bonhoffer> i'm really trying to troubleshoot -- i can't get insight into why it's failing
[17:13:36] <bonhoffer> what information can i get from alert( to tell me if everything is working)?
[17:16:32] <dabear> SIDU: that's because he's cool. get it?
[17:16:47] <dabear> :)
[17:16:55] <SIDU> dabear: yeah. cool guy :)
[17:17:32] <dabear> wonder if his entire body is cool, or if it's just his head
[17:18:00] <ChrisPartridge> Does anyone know of a fix for this: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/problem-with-draggable-and-resizable ?
[17:19:04] <bonhoffer> how do i test to see if #overlay exists?
[17:19:09] <bonhoffer> xpath?
[17:19:30] <bonhoffer> trying alert($('#overlay').xpath);
[17:19:59] <bonhoffer> undefined
[17:20:08] <sweetgrass> SIDU: thank you. Sorry,, just popped out for a cig.
[17:21:11] <SIDU> sweetgrass:  i m jquery dummy , coldhead is the right master to ask though. however i build something in jquery from 0 knoweldge :)
[17:21:34] <sweetgrass> SIDU: you appear to know more than i
[17:22:01] <sweetgrass> html & css are my area
[17:22:02] <SIDU> sweetgrass: really WOW
[17:22:10] <sweetgrass> SIDU: lol
[17:22:47] <SIDU> sweetgrass: well. dummy sometimes is not that bad, i build SIDU which is the best SQL gui you can get , try it
[17:24:43] <sweetgrass> SIDU: with that little snippet, is it possible to just have one column show at a time?
[17:26:39] <SIDU> sweetgrass: yeah. you can add css class to hide by default. then toggle at your choice.
[17:28:43] <sweetgrass> SIDU: that's what i am doing but i don't see how i get toggle to work over multiple columns and where it'll only show one column at a time
[17:29:54] <sweetgrass> SIDU: apologies, I am quite possibly being utterly shit at explaining stuff
[17:31:30] <SIDU> sweetgrass:  ok you want to show|hide something one at once, try this :
[17:32:32] <SIDU> sweetgrass: http://sidu.sourceforge.net/css/  on right side : the tabs : use this into your table will work
[17:33:34] <SIDU> sweetgrass: mouse over tab1 , tab2 .. see if that what you want ? if yes, edit into your table
[17:34:27] <sweetgrass> SIDU: that's more like it and that's how it works now pretty much but i don't seem to be able to get any effects to work.
[17:36:06] <SIDU> sweetgrass: or you can screen print your project, and let me have a look what you need
[17:37:29] <mrbig1> How can I get a jsonp ajax call to not attempt to parse or execute the returned data as a javascript function?
[17:38:24] <SIDU> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/zsjFd/  i have a bug here: click on table, before remote text is loaded, click on views, then remote text is missloaded into wrong box.
[17:39:15] <SIDU> coldhead: however this example not working, not urgent though . if easy fix, i would like to learn from u :)
[17:41:56] <bonhoffer> so length is good at letting my know this doesn't exist
[17:42:03] <bonhoffer> $('#foo').length
[17:42:57] <sweetgrass> SIDU: shall i dcc the screen grab?
[17:44:41] <SIDU> sweetgrass:  try some image paste bin ?
[17:47:03] <sweetgrass> SIDU: http://imagepaste.nullnetwork.net/viewimage.php?id=2756
[17:47:12] <xp_prg> does anyone know if I can use jquery on a facebook iframe html tab?
[17:48:39] <SIDU> sweetgrass: ok, i see, so select option=kicking stats, show it, if something else, show something else , is it right ?
[17:48:56] <sweetgrass> SIDU: correct :)
[17:49:17] <SIDU> sweetgrass: ok. that's similar to my Htab class. in a sec..
[17:50:03] <sweetgrass> SIDU: I've got it working but i don't understand why it is that when i try to add effects, it goes slow and buggy
[17:51:01] <SIDU> sweetgrass: well. if it is slow, you need to optimize your display code.
[17:53:00] <SIDU> SIDU: you need to design howto show your table quickly, then make the jquery working. the jq is easy part.
[17:55:10] <SIDU> SIDU:  you can either add class for each of the "kicking stats" fields, or you treat "kicking stats" as a table, then td inside your big table.
[17:55:25] <SIDU> sweetgrass: then toggle the table.
[17:58:35] <iSaleK> How can I get the 2nd class property of an item?
[17:58:53] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: second class?
[17:59:11] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: order doesn't matter with classes
[17:59:20] <iSaleK> if I have div like this <div class='first second third'>text</div>
[17:59:30] <iSaleK> How can I check/get second from class?
[17:59:48] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: so you want to know if the div has the second class?
[18:00:02] <iSaleK> Not really, I need to extract the second class
[18:00:21] <iSaleK> I would use hasClass() but I need to get the second class only
[18:00:34] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: that sound janky
[18:00:46] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: like, not very well written...
[18:00:54] <ryanneufeld_> the order of the classes should never matter
[18:01:10] <ryanneufeld_> ?demo @ iSaleK
[18:01:10] <bot-t> iSaleK, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[18:01:32] <mrbig1> is there any way to get the raw text from a jsonp response?
[18:01:47] <iSaleK> I have array that has all visible classes, and I need to check every item in sidebar to see if his class (category, the 2nd class) is in array
[18:02:13] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: can you get a demo working on jsfiddle?
[18:02:43] <iSaleK> I think I can't
[18:02:50] <ryanneufeld_> ?jqhxr @mrbig1
[18:02:52] <bot-t> mrbig1, javascript - Understanding jQuery's jqXHR - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7638847/understanding-jquerys-jqxhr
[18:03:00] <ryanneufeld_> mrbig1: that might help you?
[18:03:37] <sweetgrass> SIDU: i have a class set on one group, the rest are hidden with .js table .colName { display: none;}
[18:03:45] <mrbig1> ryanneufeld_: that's not specific to jsonp
[18:04:05] <iSaleK> Those divs all have the same 1st class and the second one is the category ID, like <div class='desc cat1'>Description</div> So I need to extract the 2nd attribute which is cat1 and use it later on...
[18:04:16] <ryanneufeld_> mrbig1: well, you should able to get the response text from the xhr
[18:04:28] <mrbig1> ah
[18:04:45] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: sounds like you should be using data attibutes, or ids for that
[18:04:57] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: can you show me a sample of just the HTML?
[18:05:08] <iSaleK> Sure, where can I paste it?
[18:05:16] <ryanneufeld_> jsfiddle.net
[18:05:29] <sweetgrass> SIDU: my select and a little query to switch a .visible class to the selected column.
[18:08:55] <iSaleK> ryanneufeld_: Where do I get the URL for this paste? :\
[18:09:05] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: click save
[18:09:12] <ryanneufeld_> :0
[18:09:18] <ryanneufeld_> * ;)
[18:09:33] <iSaleK> Nothing happens... and I have JS enabled :\
[18:09:37] <iSaleK> Will try in Chrome now
[18:09:48] <ryanneufeld_> paste the url from your address bar
[18:10:30] <iSaleK> http://jsfiddle.net/EUXh7/
[18:10:40] <iSaleK> It's not working in my FF for some reason :\
[18:10:57] <ryanneufeld_> weird
[18:10:58] <iSaleK> I have made this function but In console I get the whole element properties instead of just string
[18:13:10] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: k, i'm looking
[18:13:10] <sweetgrass> coldhead: Hi, SIDU mentioned you were the got-to guy for some jquery pointers.
[18:14:29] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: okay, so what divs are you working with?
[18:15:10] <iSaleK> These that have kat-2, kat-3 etc as class
[18:15:23] <iSaleK> Althou they all have markerDesc as 1st class attribute
[18:15:28] <mrbig1> ryanneufeld_: I don't see any way to get the responseText from the xhr, and i'm checking with firebug
[18:15:43] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: k
[18:16:21] <mrbig1> damn maybe it wont do that for jsonp
[18:16:48] <iSaleK> ryanneufeld_: check my function that I've created... You will get the point of what I'm trying to do...
[18:16:55] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: I don't see the markerDesc class you're mentioning
[18:17:23] <iSaleK> ryanneufeld_: It's because jQuery is replacing it and I'm using FireFox View->Generated Source
[18:17:51] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: that's not very helpful :p
[18:18:15] <iSaleK> Well with view source you would see none of the divs :)
[18:18:46] <ryanneufeld_> oic
[18:18:50] <iSaleK> ryanneufeld_: Is there a way to get nth property of class attribute?
[18:19:04] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: no
[18:19:13] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: you can't rely on that
[18:19:25] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: That's what I'm trying to tell you
[18:19:31] <iSaleK> ryanneufeld_: Well can I at least get the class as string and then do str replace? :)
[18:19:33] <ryanneufeld_> also what you're code is doing, could be done much better
[18:19:46] <iSaleK> How?
[18:19:59] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: you just want to remove the class if it has it right?
[18:20:19] <iSaleK> I want to check if that class (2nd one) is in given array
[18:20:27] <iSaleK> if yes, then hide that div
[18:20:51] <ryanneufeld_> $('markerDesc').removeClass('markerDesc');
[18:20:58] <ryanneufeld_> $('.markerDesc').removeClass('markerDesc');
[18:21:10] <ryanneufeld_> the second one
[18:21:29] <iSaleK> ryanneufeld_: Problem is that I need that class to stay but hide the div :)
[18:21:35] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: oh
[18:21:42] <ryanneufeld_> $('.markerDesc').hide();
[18:22:16] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: that will hide any element that has the class 'markerDesc'
[18:23:21] <iSaleK> ryanneufeld_: I'm sorry I've must have terriblly explained my problem... The thing is .markerDesc is common class for all divs. I want to filter div and I'm doing it like so: I get all selected checkboxes in array, now I want to select every .markerDesc element and check if it's 2nd class attribude is in array
[18:23:52] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: I get that
[18:23:53] <iSaleK> *checkbox values ofcourse
[18:24:13] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: What I'm trying to tell you, is that it's unwise to rely on the order of the classes
[18:25:00] <iSaleK> I know but in this case I know for sure in which order they will be... since I'm generating them via php
[18:25:09] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: either way
[18:25:18] <iSaleK> What's the other option you suggest?
[18:26:16] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: can you add all your JS code for this to this fiddle and update it? http://jsfiddle.net/EUXh7/1/
[18:27:15] <iSaleK> Just for filter function or filter + gen functions?
[18:27:26] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: the array etc you're talking about
[18:27:39] <iSaleK> Ok, updated
[18:27:41] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: I'm having a hard time picturing what your code is doing
[18:27:45] <ryanneufeld_> new url?
[18:27:52] <iSaleK> http://jsfiddle.net/EUXh7/1/
[18:28:07] <ryanneufeld_> you have to click update :p
[18:28:13] <ryanneufeld_> that's the same one lol
[18:28:19] <iSaleK> http://jsfiddle.net/EUXh7/2/
[18:28:35] <iSaleK> Sorry, I did but the address just changed to /1/ :)
[18:29:32] <iSaleK> I've never used the jquery but should I consider learning and using it for this filtering?
[18:29:43] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: well, first of all
[18:29:48] <ryanneufeld_> you don't need to make that array
[18:29:59] <ryanneufeld_> $('#filterlist input[type=checkbox]:checked')
[18:30:18] <ryanneufeld_> already is an array (jquery wrapped array) of the checked elements
[18:31:07] <ryanneufeld_> what is this doing: console.log($(this).attr('class', function(i, attr) { return attr.replace('markerDesc ', ''); }));
[18:31:44] <iSaleK> It's returning the all elements properties, but I wanted it to just return the class as string without 'markerDesc' :\
[18:31:56] <ryanneufeld_> no, no it's not
[18:31:57] <iSaleK> *all element properites
[18:32:18] <ryanneufeld_> that is removing the markerDesc class
[18:32:38] <iSaleK> :(
[18:32:49] <ryanneufeld_> which is why you're not seeing it in the generated source
[18:33:38] <iSaleK> So I should use something like var thisClass = $(this).attr('class'); and then thisClass = thisClass.replace('markerDesc ', ''); ??
[18:33:59] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: no
[18:34:51] <ryanneufeld_> so what you're wanting to do, is hide any divs that have a class that matches the id of a checkbox?
[18:34:55] <ryanneufeld_> that is checked?
[18:35:21] <ryanneufeld_> is that correct?
[18:35:29] <iSaleK> Not really
[18:35:40] <iSaleK> I want to hide those who's checkbox is unchecked :)
[18:35:56] <ryanneufeld_> okay
[18:36:01] <k1ng> i need help with .delegate(). i need to use not selector
[18:36:03] <k1ng> how do i do it?
[18:36:48] <k1ng> 	$("body").delegate("table.WSGTableResults tr:not=WSGResultsHeader: not=WSGResultS","mouseover mouseout", function(event) { });
[18:37:20] <k1ng> WSGResultsHeader are class

[18:38:56] <iSaleK> ryanneufeld_: Work like a charm :)
[18:39:06] <iSaleK> ryanneufeld_: thank you very much!
[18:39:14] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: np
[18:39:19] <k1ng> http://pastebin.com/TVSWAVmn
[18:39:33] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: like I said, order should never matter on classes, there is always a better way ;)
[18:40:35] <iSaleK> ryanneufeld_: Well I'm not that much experienced with jQuery like you are but I'm here to learn from you guys :)
[18:40:50] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: yeah, well, I'm glad I could help
[18:40:55] <ryanneufeld_> k1ng: http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[18:41:10] <iSaleK> ryanneufeld_: thank you once more :)
[18:41:12] <ryanneufeld_> k1ng: in response to your initial question, that's how you use the not celector
[18:41:15] <ryanneufeld_> *selector
[18:41:27] <k1ng> yeah i know
[18:44:00] <ChrisPartridge> Trying to .append() some html elements to a div, which have relative positioning - it seems that the elements ignore the positioning and re-arrange so they don't collide (some elements render over top of each other) - any suggestions?
[18:46:18] <iSaleK> ryanneufeld_: Why I can use .not(":checked").each but when I use .is(":checked").each it says "is not a function" :\
[18:46:38] <ryanneufeld_> what is not a function?
[18:46:41] <ryanneufeld_> each?
[18:46:43] <ryanneufeld_> is(
[18:46:48] <ryanneufeld_> returns true or false
[18:47:00] <iSaleK> I'm trying to 1st hide those who are unchecked and then show those who's chekcbox is checked
[18:47:06] <iSaleK> $("#filterlist input[type=checkbox]").is(":checked").each is not a function
[18:47:41] <ryanneufeld_> iSaleK: is returns true or false
[18:47:49] <ryanneufeld_> so you can't chain it like taht
[18:47:59] <ryanneufeld_> $("#filterlist input[type=checkbox]:checked")
[18:48:04] <ryanneufeld_> will do what you're wanting
[18:48:12] <iSaleK> Ok, thank you :)
[18:48:49] <ryanneufeld_> k1ng: :not(.WSGResultsHeader)
[18:49:02] <k1ng> i need 2 of them
[18:49:11] <k1ng> WSGResultS too
[18:49:24] <k1ng> .WSGResultsHeader and .WSGResultS
[18:50:11] <ryanneufeld_> you can try :not(.classone):not(.classtwo)
[18:51:50] <ryanneufeld_> k1ng: also $(this).attr('class') != 'WSGResultsHeader' is bad
[18:51:57] <ryanneufeld_> k1ng: us .hasClass
[18:52:03] <k1ng> ok
[18:52:08] <ryanneufeld_> k1ng: returns boolean
[18:52:28] <ryanneufeld_> and then if there is another class on the same element it will still work
[18:52:39] <k1ng> ok
[18:52:40] <k1ng> thanks
[18:52:43] <ryanneufeld_> np
[18:53:15] <ryanneufeld_> k1ng: also point of note you can do that entire thing in css
[18:56:42] <^zoggy^> .hasClass is being retired.. use .is
[18:57:23] <ryanneufeld_> ^zoggy^: uhm what?
[18:57:42] <^zoggy^> well rather its one of the ones that been suggested to be depref
[18:58:04] <ryanneufeld_> ^zoggy^: where was this announced?
[18:58:06] <^zoggy^> ?jquery .is
[18:58:07] <bot-t> ^zoggy^, .is() - Check the current matched set of elements against a selector and return true if at least one of these elements matches the selector. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[18:58:27] <^zoggy^> ryanneufeld, in http://blog.jquery.com/2011/11/08/building-a-slimmer-jquery/
[18:59:24] <ryanneufeld_> ^zoggy^: I'm sorry I'm not seeing it mentioned
[19:00:01] <^zoggy^> ctrl+f
[19:00:09] <ryanneufeld_> mhmm
[19:00:14] <ryanneufeld_> and it's mentioned in two comments
[19:00:19] <ryanneufeld_> not the article itself
[19:00:24] <ryanneufeld_> stop spreading missinformation
[19:00:33] <^zoggy^> yes, like i said its been suggested to be depreciated
[19:00:34] <^zoggy^> not that it was
[19:00:49] <ryanneufeld_> ^zoggy^: no, you said it was being retired
[19:00:57] <ryanneufeld_> untill I called you out on it
[19:00:59] <^zoggy^> oh gotcha, sorry about that
[19:01:02] <^zoggy^> just woke up :)
[19:01:50] <ryanneufeld_> is will work as a replacement for hasClass indeed, but no mention of it being retired has been made by anyone official.
[19:27:01] <message144> Hi, it seems that $.format plugin doesn't seem to work with jquery 1.7. Are there any good string argument formatting solutions for v1.7?
[19:32:07] <Edler> hey guys i'm using .sortable() from jquery ui
[19:32:15] <Edler> is it possible to have something in the list that is not sortable
[19:32:16] <Edler> AND
[19:32:18] <Edler> that always remains last
[19:42:21] <ryanneufeld_> Edler: just put it outside of the sortable
[19:43:48] <Edler> but i'm floating it with other elmeents
[19:43:58] <Edler> so that they can stay aligned in a grid style
[19:44:28] <ryanneufeld_> hmm
[19:45:07] <ryanneufeld_> I'm not sure if you can do that
[19:46:05] <Edler> alright :D
[19:47:35] <ryanneufeld_> Edler: I am sure however that you can still have them floated the way you like
[19:49:55] <ryanneufeld_> Edler: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#items
[19:51:08] <ryanneufeld_> Edler: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/12/
[19:51:17] <ryanneufeld_> add a class to the last item
[19:51:33] <ryanneufeld_> it's all there in the examples
[19:54:03] <Edler> yes but the problem
[19:54:11] <Edler> you can put items in it's place
[19:54:16] <Edler> which defies the purpose
[19:57:50] <ryanneufeld_> no you can't
[19:58:30] <ryanneufeld_> oic
[19:58:50] <ryanneufeld_> well, the only other option is creative css
[21:04:08] <Scott0> smoothdivscroll is soo buggy :(
[21:04:14] <Scott0> is there a good alternative?
[21:34:45] <^zoggy^> iscroll
[21:34:45] <molavy> hi
[21:50:00] <molavy> i receive 4 row from db via getJSON, but when i use each inside getJSON it repeat 4 time for each row, so i got 16 row that are 4 row repeated 4 time
[21:52:23] <molavy> here is my code:
[21:52:24] <molavy> http://jsfiddle.net/QyMZK/
[21:54:17] <molavy> any idea?
[21:55:18] <molavy> there is no idea?
[22:06:07] <webPragmatist> is it possible to get the current node when using javascript inline?
[22:06:10] <webPragmatist> with jquery...
[22:06:51] <webPragmatist> like <div id="foo"><script … $(this)… returns div id=foo object?
[22:16:21] <molavy> there is no idea?
[22:46:12] <JohnnyDavidson> Is there a way to draw a seperate image with canvas?
[22:47:40] <necromancer> JohnnyDavidson: what do you mean by separate?
[22:49:59] <JohnnyDavidson> Nevermind I don't think it's possible
[23:30:58] <Tant102> I've got a table-like layout where every row consists of data, a validity string (valid, valid to ..., invalid, deleted, ...) and a button (remove). I'm trying to make it possible to select several rows and when copying them (ctrl-c) it should ignore the validity string and the button text. Is this possible without replacing those strings with images?
[23:32:37] <jrockjiggz> Tant102: i don't think so
[23:33:16] <Tant102> A more simplified description would be a <table> where I want some columns to be excluded when ctrl-c is pressed.
[23:33:35] <jrockjiggz> ctrl+c copies whatever is selected
[23:34:34] <jrockjiggz> if the browser could manipulate what we copy then we'd have a lot of problems
[23:35:31] <Tant102> Perhaps using checkboxes and a separate copy-to-clipboard button.
[23:35:40] <jrockjiggz> http://grumpywookie.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/copy-to-clipboard-javascript/
[23:36:21] <^zoggy^> clipboard is generally disabled for the browser to interact with
[23:36:26] <^zoggy^> the only true solution that works is to use flash
[23:37:09] <^zoggy^> http://www.deluxeblogtips.com/2010/06/javascript-copy-to-clipboard.html
[23:38:03] <Chib> you could use 2 tables instead of one, so the column you need is in the first table and the stuff you don't is in the second table
[23:38:27] <Chib> so then you can just highlight and copy that first column/table
[23:39:45] <Tant102> Chib, that would work as long as I can match the height of every cell.
[23:42:39] <m0dmd> hey everyone.
[23:43:01] <m0dmd> can someone recommend a plugin that can do the effect on the parent navigation of this website -> http://pixelittle.com/blog/
[23:43:58] <m0dmd> I like the text color transition to black.
[23:45:20] <Chib> m0dmd: Page Not Found
[23:45:48] <Chib> nm
[23:48:21] <Chib> that appears to be flash
[23:48:27] <m0dmd> exactly.
[23:48:45] <m0dmd> Any plugins that can do that currently?
[23:49:01] <m0dmd> If not, I'll just have to code it manually
[23:49:22] <Chib> i don't even know how you could code it s:
[23:50:08] <Woet> m0dmd: animate and overlay over it which gives you the effect
[23:50:10] <m0dmd> it adds the layer of text
[23:50:12] <Woet> an overlay *
[23:50:29] <m0dmd> thanx woet!
[23:50:54] <m0dmd> overlay is king
[23:51:17] <Woet> there might be a better solution with css3, but im not sure
[23:52:20] <Woet> m0dmd: http://nicewebtype.com/notes/2009/07/24/pure-css-text-gradient-no-pngs/ - maybe you can animate that
