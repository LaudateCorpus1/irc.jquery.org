[01:09:10] <php> GameOfTrolls, you're American, right?
[01:09:27] <php> In most of the U
[01:09:29] <GameOfTrolls> php, haha no
[01:09:33] <GameOfTrolls> why do you ask?
[01:09:36] <GameOfTrolls> i live in Canada :)
[01:09:42] <php> In most of the UK the joke doesn't sound right
[01:09:49] <php> Since Jake isn't Jayk
[01:09:56] <php> :D
[01:09:58] <GameOfTrolls> :D
[01:10:03] <GameOfTrolls> why are you here php

[01:12:51] <FoxRocks> I'm Canadian as well..I think with us running the same time zone as the States, people see us online and assume.
[01:13:19] <GameOfTrolls> php that is because there is a huge language war going on. javascript vs php and people get territorial :D
[01:13:37] <GameOfTrolls> but anyway, i was merely kidding :)

[04:05:20] <al_nz1> is there a way to test if jquery is corrently added to my project in jquery
[04:05:24] <al_nz1> in VS express
[05:23:12] <Hans-Martin> Is there a way to quickly create a new jsfiddle that links the necessary resources for a jQuery mobile example? In the Javascript pane, I can only select various jQuery versions but for jQm the appropriate JS and CSS files are needed as well.
[07:09:00] <anotheryou> hi. I want to detect the main scrolling div on a site. So I'm looking for a div with a scrollbar, that is furthest up in the dom hierarchy. What would be an efficient way to iterate through the dom?
[07:09:25] <anotheryou> $('body *').each(function() { ?
[07:09:57] <anotheryou> I don't know which functions go line for line through the dom and which go hierarchy layer for hierarchy layer
[07:12:59] <anotheryou> i need the reverse of "closest()"
[07:25:05] <anotheryou> first() sorta does it, but i need something like first('body *').is(hasscrollbar == true);
[07:25:36] <anotheryou> (but my example obviously does not work, because first wont iterate far :) "
[07:25:37] <anotheryou> )
[07:33:29] <anotheryou> or can I bind to any div that scrolls? something along the lines of " $("*").scroll(function() {"
[08:38:53] <anotheryou> ok, works on some sites, but not on those, where it's not the body that scrolls: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/20937-red-read-line
[11:11:09] <noobandnoober> hi
[11:11:40] <mmmveggies> noobandnoober: hello
[11:12:04] <noobandnoober> does anybody a know a fast way to sort elements based on their position in the dom? i tried this but it's way too slow: https://jsfiddle.net/03mpcxkr/ thanks
[11:20:20] <mmmveggies> noobandnoober: you can use document.querySelectorAll() and pass in a query string that will match all your elements
[11:20:42] <mmmveggies> and the order that they are returned in will be their order in the dom
[11:35:09] <paule32> hello, need help:  https://paste.fedoraproject.org/384995/66954962/
[11:35:28] <paule32> how can i add "functions/properties" to array and get back?
[11:53:43] <Hans-Martin> I'm trying to implement a login page that redirects to the main page if login is successful. This works, but the URL bar of the browser still shows the .../login.php URL instead of the main URL (which just ends with /). I'm unsure whether this is a browser behaviour or something done by jQuery mobile. I know that links may reload pages using AJAX, but HTTP Location headers should not be affected by that, or should they?
[12:05:40] <mmmveggies> Hans-Martin: that's your backend. Is it a 30X type redirect? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL_redirection#Redirect_status_codes_and_characteristics
[12:18:36] <Hans-Martin> mmmveggies: thx, I'll have a look!
[13:27:47] <Hans-Martin> mmmveggies: well it doesn't seem to matter which of the 3xx http status codes I return with my response, the browser does not show the URL given in the Location header :-(
[13:28:37] <mmmveggies> are you changing window.location based on your callback?
[13:28:38] <Hans-Martin> and it does not execute the script in the target page, which causes the dynamic parts to fail miserably :-(
[13:28:57] <Hans-Martin> mmmveggies: currently I'm not changing window.location
[13:29:24] <Hans-Martin> I tried, but it did not have the desired effect.
[13:30:11] <Hans-Martin> (actually, it wasn't executed, because it was part of the target document's script that was not executed either)
[13:30:58] <mmmveggies> Hans-Martin: sounds like you have a problem in workflow organization
[13:32:39] <Hans-Martin> yeah. weird, as the redirection from the index.php file to the login.php works without a hitch. Only the transition back does not change the URL field (and does not execute the JS). Must be some caching issue perhaps, I'll better keep it out of #jquery
[13:46:45] <Hans-Martin> well, it was a jQuery mobile problem after all... jqm initializes early and messes with the whole navigation machinery to make it AJAX everywhere. That did not work quite right with the login page...

[14:52:42] <ashzade> Hello all. I need a bit of help iterating over a set of fields. I have 19 rows and want to get the value of the last non-empty field. so if it's not empty and the last of the non-empty fields.
[14:53:00] <ashzade> I have my each and can check if it's not empty but don't know how to check if it's last in the non-empties
[14:59:52] <ashzade> Right now I'm creating an array of non-empty arrays the fetching the last item in the array
[15:01:10] <shoky> ashzade i'd prolly just use .filter() and .last()
[15:02:15] <shoky> e.g.  $('.field').filter(function() { return whether empty or not }).last()
[15:02:29] <ashzade> that's much cleaner!
[15:39:53] <GeekMonkey> What is the correct way to write a script tag into the HTML with jquery
[15:41:36] <shoky> what do you mean? what do you want to do exactly
[15:42:10] <GeekMonkey> I want to insert a <script> if condition is true
[15:43:43] <shoky> you can insert a script element into the DOM, that may or may not give you whatever result you're expecting..
[15:44:12] <shoky> e.g.  $('<script>').attr('src', 'bla.js').appendTo('head')
[15:46:30] <GeekMonkey> that might work
[15:53:24] <GeekMonkey> shoky what if I have custom attribute names?
[15:54:15] <GeekMonkey> This is my code
[15:54:16] <GeekMonkey> https://kobra.io/#/e/-KL4XNt1iLSbsdImJecB
[15:54:56] <shoky> put the attribute names in quotes ""
[15:55:48] <GeekMonkey> awesome
[17:13:48] <grill__> why would the "find()" method not find an element that is clearly a descendant of an element in the selected element (i see it in innerHTML) upon the initial page load, even though it *can* find it later on? to be clear, the matched element is in the innerHTML property of the selector at document ready, but find() isn't finding it until calls made later on
[17:22:54] <shoky> link to a testcase/jsfiddle or at least some code
[17:23:32] <shoky> grill__ ^
[17:24:02] <grill__> shoky i'll try, but this is a really strage situation
[17:25:11] <grill__> actually, yeah i don't even think i can build a minimal case for this. why would an element not be able to be found even though it exists in the innerHTML property?
[17:25:32] <shoky> donno :)
[17:27:53] <shoky> but my first guess would be you are doing something wrong
[17:28:14] <grill__> ah, yes, that's it
[17:28:24] <grill__> something wrong
[17:28:43] <shoky> best answer you'll get without more info
[17:30:22] <grill__> yeah i know. the point is that the element exists in the dom (or at least it exists in the "innerHTML" property), but the find() method doesn't find it at document ready time. it will find it later on though
[17:30:47] <shoky> and my point is i don't even know how you are calling .find()
[17:30:55] <shoky> (for example)
[17:58:48] <saadomy> hello
[17:59:03] <saadomy> how do I go about selecting children of classes in jQuery?
[18:06:56] <andromedian> saadomy, $('body').children();
[18:22:49] <saadomy> andromedian: lets say that each ‘.item’ has a ‘.description’…I want to hover over ‘.item’ and then have its ‘.description’ highlighted. How would I select that specfics item’s children? (‘.description’)
[18:23:26] <saadomy> andromedian: something like (this > .description)
[18:27:27] <shoky> saadomy: you do that with css.   .item:hover .description { ... }
[18:28:04] <shoky> and if you really needed to do it with jquery,  $(this).find('.description')  in event handlers for .item
[18:33:44] <saadomy> shoky: so could i also do $(this).find(‘.description’).addClass(‘someClass’)?
[18:49:48] <shoky> saadomy: yes. but again, this is done with css
[21:32:37] <PDP-71> I've always disliked jQuery for various reasons, but I thought I would give it a shot now that it's at generation 3.
[21:32:49] <PDP-71> What exactly can jQuery do that's so great that I can't do with pure JavaScript?
[21:33:24] <PDP-71> If I'm gonna learn double APIs and double syntax (essentially), I'd like it to be worth it.
[22:15:55] <systemfault> ...
[22:16:11] <systemfault> PDP-71: So, you waited for jQuery to become nearly useless to start using it>
[22:16:17] <systemfault> Good job.
[22:24:10] <mmmveggies> jquery is great if you want to use the plugins
[22:24:20] <mmmveggies> like slick slider
[22:25:15] <saadomy> slick carousel
[22:25:27] <saadomy> i just started using that, except I was told to never use coursels
[22:25:33] <saadomy> carousels*
[22:25:44] <saadomy> http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[22:26:55] <mmmveggies> saadomy: sometimes you have no choice. sometimes your boss tells you to put in a carousel
[22:28:18] <saadomy> mmmveggies: yeahh definitely
[22:28:52] <saadomy> mmmveggies: what do you do? I
[22:31:44] <mmmveggies> I exist as a jelly
