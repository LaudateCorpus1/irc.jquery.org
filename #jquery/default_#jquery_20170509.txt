[00:02:16] <TikityTik> How can I select the first img tag that is a descendant of #imgPanel?
[00:03:12] <TikityTik> nevermind
[01:15:15] <tash> if I do this in my .post() to add rows to my table, $("#released tbody").last().append( data ); ... how can I prevent it duplicating rows?  Meaning, I submit my form and it adds new rows ... I submit my form again and it doesn't clear that data, it just adds the same rows again
[01:30:12] <pavonia> tash: Set a global variable which rows have already been posted
[01:58:22] <Cork> tash: you could have a data-id ref on the row when you create it, and if you find it skip the append
[01:58:43] <Cork> it's how i usually do it
[02:34:59] <Al_nz1> Can someone confirm this approah is correct? I need to have a row of 3 dropdowns, each dropdown corresponds to a colum on a table below it. After making all three selections you click a "add row" button - and the values from the 3 dropdowns is entered into the list to create a corresponding row in the table?
[02:57:00] <pavonia> Al_nz1: Do you want to restrict the contents of the table to a fixed set of values only?
[03:02:48] <Al_nz1> pavonia: yes - the drop downs will do that
[03:05:48] <pavonia> Well, it's one way to do that then
[03:12:55] <Al_nz1> so I got a button to do : $('#table_stats > tbody:last-child').append('<tr>3253</tr>9<tr>No</tr>'); - but then how to do refresh page?
[03:12:59] <Al_nz1> to get it to show up?
[03:13:19] <Cork> Al_nz1: you don't refresh when you modify dom
[03:13:27] <Cork> by modifying the dom you do the refresh
[03:13:39] <Al_nz1> Cork: hmmm, some other problem I have then.
[03:13:39] <Cork> so if it doesn't show up, you most likely have a broken selector
[03:14:02] <Cork> and :last-child looks wrong to me
[03:14:21] <Cork> i suspect $('#table_stats > tbody').append() is what you want
[03:14:39] <Cork> (unless you actually have multiple tbody elements in your table)
[03:16:15] <Dhaval_> function updateDiv(){     //Get new content through Ajax     ...     $('#div-id').html(newContent); }  setInterval(updateDiv, 5000); // That's five seconds
[03:16:27] <Al_nz1> Cork: from here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/171027/add-table-row-in-jquery
[03:17:02] <Cork> Al_nz1: ya, but what you need to use depends on the content of the page
[03:17:22] <Cork> Dhaval_: ok?
[03:17:51] <Dhaval_> yes Cork perfect :)
[03:18:06] <Cork> do you have a question to go what that question or did you just want to show that you know how to count miliseconds?
[03:19:15] <Cork> Dhaval_: also, be very careful with setInterval if you ever risk doing something that can take the slightest amount of time
[03:19:23] <Dhaval_> i just gave hint for counting time interval for refresh page
[03:19:38] <Cork> cause setInterval doesn't care at all how long it takes to run the code, so you can end up in a situation where things runs constantly
[03:19:51] <Cork> Dhaval_: aaand someone asked for that?
[03:20:10] <pavonia> Does that even work, as the Ajax call is asynchronous?
[03:20:15] <Cork> no
[03:20:18] <Cork> well it can
[03:20:27] <Cork> as long as the ajax call never takes more then about 4 seconds
[03:20:37] <Cork> if it does you will have the condition i mentioned above
[03:21:06] <Al_nz1> https://snag.gy/gq7jFf.jpg ,- does the length: 0 mean it didnt find anything?
[03:21:12] <Cork> yes
[03:21:32] <Cork> jquery returns an array like object
[03:21:40] <Cork> and if .length is 0 it means the list is empty
[03:23:35] <Al_nz1> well I must be doing something wrong: $('#table_stats > tbody'); returns nothing for
[03:23:52] <Cork> Al_nz1: is your tables id called "table_stats"?
[03:23:52] <Al_nz1> <table class="table table-hover table_stats">
[03:23:59] <Cork> uh.. thats a class...
[03:25:39] <Al_nz1> duh
[03:25:44] <Al_nz1> man Im tired
[03:25:54] <Al_nz1> I really should stop - thanks codelahoma

[03:37:19] <Deusdeorum> Can I merge two variables into one url? myurl1 + param = www.google.com/abcdef
[03:37:26] <Deusdeorum> where abcdef being the params
[03:37:41] <Cork> you can, though you prob want to use $.param
[03:38:05] <Cork> url + $.param({ key: val, key2: val2, ...})
[03:38:07] <Deusdeorum> ahhhhh, yes! ty
[03:38:34] <Deusdeorum> always so simple solutions, i dont know why i couldn't google my way there lol
[03:38:48] <Deusdeorum> its early
[03:38:51] <Cork> Deusdeorum: also as a third point, if your using ajax, you don't need to do this at all
[03:39:00] <Deusdeorum> no ajax!
[03:39:15] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { type: 'get', data: { param: val, goes: here } })
[03:39:21] <Cork> just so you know though :)
[03:39:59] <Deusdeorum> Yes, thanks!
[03:56:38] <sonu_nk> is there any way to pretify html using  jQuery ? i am printing my html source in div.. and its messy there.i want to make them line by line using jQuery
[03:57:45] <Cork> sonu_nk: no, not without a plugin
[03:57:58] * Cork suggests searching for jquery tidy
[03:58:54] <Al_nz1> <select class="selectpicker form-control stats-code-picker" id="statscode0" data-live-search="true" title="Type first 3 characters" th:field="*{stats[0].code}"><option value="1543">1543 - Male Assaults Female</option>
[03:59:20] <Al_nz1> how do I get the value from the bootstrap dropdown
[03:59:36] <Cork> Al_nz1: make a jsfiddle if you want to show code
[04:00:03] <Cork> reading three line wrapped of a gigantic html line isn't fun
[04:01:28] <Duikb00t> Looking fur an easy html <video> player
[04:01:34] <Duikb00t> overlay
[04:01:45] <Duikb00t> fancybox ok check thx
[04:03:39] <Cork> umm, fancybox isn't exactly a video player...
[04:03:50] <Cork> its just an overlay supporting loading things in an iframe
[04:04:10] <Cork> the video player controls would have to be provided by something else
[04:06:19] <sonu_nk> Cork, i did not any solution on google like simple include jquery lib and call the method and pass messy html and get the pretty html to print... can you refer me any plugin ?
[04:11:56] <Cork> sonu_nk: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+tidy+html
[04:12:50] <sonu_nk> :D Cork i already did lot of google for this .. but did not find any pl;ugin which can do this on webpage
[04:13:05] <Cork> did you check the _first_ result?
[04:14:14] <Al_nz1> Cork: takes bloody ages to work out what CDNs you need to get even a small code sample to render properly
[04:14:18] <Al_nz1> thats why I hate fiddle
[04:14:34] <Cork> Al_nz1: you don't have to have a fully working example
[04:14:49] <Cork> just include the html and the relevant js you wrote
[04:15:00] <Cork> if more external reference is needed i can ask for it later
[04:15:23] <Al_nz1> Cork: Ok
[04:15:38] <Cork> the fully working is only needed when a specific "this isn't working but should" problem occurs
[04:15:53] <Cork> for how to it can be a simple paste
[04:17:22] <Al_nz1> I am trying to get the value of the selected item in dropdown
[04:17:23] <Al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/1pftqo7n/6/
[04:17:37] <Cork> sonu_nk: (or actually second or thind or... the search result is full of hits)
[04:18:51] <Cork> Al_nz1: on load you don't have any options in #table_stats
[04:19:07] <Cork> also .val() not .value()
[04:19:40] <sonu_nk> Cork, checking the same..i was searching the "Pretty Print html js "
[04:19:55] <Al_nz1> well if it would render i would be able to select something
[04:20:09] <Cork> Al_nz1: you have to make sure you have called the template generation code and inserted that into the page before that selector can work
[04:20:36] <Cork> and also value() => .val() like i said
[04:23:52] <Al_nz1> well there is a bunch of external CDNs - I have added the ones I think I needed to
[04:24:20] <sonu_nk> Cork, http://lovasoa.github.io/tidy-html5/demo.html +1 thanks
[04:25:33] <Cork> sonu_nk: also, please double post, ask in one channel at a time...
[04:25:46] <Cork> (if noone answers then sure ask away)
[04:26:06] <sonu_nk> Cork, agree :) thanx
[04:26:18] <Cork> its rude to make ppl throw away there time looking for an answer when someone else is already doing it
[04:26:42] <sonu_nk> ok
[04:40:34] <naftilos76> Hi, is there a way to find a tag element with its' css color property set to a specific color like we can find tag elements which have specific attributes? $("[data-user_defined_attr]") ???
[04:41:14] <Cork> naftilos76: no, use a class and set the color in css
[04:41:19] <Cork> it is by far the best way to do this
[04:42:10] <naftilos76> Cork, i want to get the element as a jquery obj, not set its' color property
[04:42:19] <Cork> if the color value is user modifiable then a data-color property is the second best
[04:42:41] <Cork> naftilos76: i get you, but you can't select elements by css property
[04:42:51] <Cork> well you can but it will run like shit
[04:43:19] <Cork> $('*').filter(function() { return $(this).css('color') == 'value'; })
[04:43:46] <naftilos76> Cork, i guess i can if i use .each method and the like but that is not what i am looking for...
[04:43:49] <naftilos76> Thanks
[04:44:15] <Cork> naftilos76: so my comment meant if the color isn't actually modifyable freely by the visitor of the site
[04:44:27] <Cork> naftilos76: set the color as a css class and just filter on that instead
[04:44:34] <Cork> the result will be much faster much cleaner code
[04:44:54] <naftilos76> yeah i can certainly do that, thanks
[04:50:02] <Al_nz1> Cork: I got my example to go. http://www.bootply.com/r8NcKeVAqn - the problem now is on the table I want to display the option, but later I will need value when it goes into db?
[04:51:30] <Al_nz1> or anyone for that matter
[04:52:07] <Cork> not even sure what i'm suppose to look for here
[04:52:56] <Al_nz1> Cork: so make a selection on each dropdown and hit add. it will create a row in the table
[04:53:10] <Cork> its just a white page with a black top bar
[04:53:48] <Al_nz1> I get all the frames on teh page to render
[04:53:54] <Al_nz1> its fiddle for bootstrap
[04:54:03] <Al_nz1> you in chrome?
[04:55:44] <Cork> ya
[04:55:57] <Al_nz1> well put it this way
[04:56:20] <Al_nz1> you know now with a dropdown you can display text to the user, but store value
[04:57:57] <Al_nz1> because my dropdown selections go to a table, i need to do that with a table. store value x, but display y
[05:16:01] <shai5482> Hello can someone help me with this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43865101/bind-all-contenteditable-on-the-page-from-content-script
[05:29:16] <Amnesia> question, it it possible to use an or operator in jquery's selector?
[05:29:36] <Amnesia> e.g. $(".foo|.bar .ui-selected")
[07:09:08] <sopparus> hello, how can I get value of <input class="form-control" type="text" name="Leverans">
[07:09:17] <sopparus> i want to get value by giving Leverans
[07:09:42] <Cork> $('input[name="Leverans"]').val()
[07:10:15] <Cork> if your prepping data for ajax sumission you might want to just use $('form').serialize() or .serializeArray()
[07:11:05] <sopparus> thanks alot, ill try that too
[07:12:37] <sopparus> ah so I can get all input in one array?
[07:12:43] <sopparus> if I drop leverans
[07:13:10] <Cork> you can get all form fields, not just inputs
[07:13:20] <sopparus> ('input').serializeArray() ?
[07:13:38] <Cork> you should have a <form> tag around the form
[07:13:48] <Cork> just grab that element and do .serializeArray()
[07:14:13] <Cork> the array can then be given directly to ajax
[07:14:40] <Cork> so ex. $.ajax(url, { type: 'post', data: $('#my-form').serializeArray() }).done()
[07:14:41] <sopparus> thats just too good to be true, you saved me hours. thanks alot
[07:16:18] <Cork> oh, if you don't know .done() there is a callback binder
[07:16:40] <Cork> so you don't need it unless you want to react a successful response from the server
[08:22:01] <codecutter> Those guys over at highcharts take ages to respond when they do they completely misunderstand the question then it takes them ages to correct the thing and respond
[08:22:58] <codecutter> how do i covert the level 2 labels into links? https://jsfiddle.net/aepu6dvt/10/
[08:23:34] <codecutter> e.g. after clicking on "Europe", you see level 2
[08:28:50] <codecutter> brb
[08:36:21] <codecutter> any suggestions?
[08:39:49] <MikeD_> can you explain what you mean by "convert into links" ?
[08:41:12] <codecutter> MikeD_: ofcoure
[08:41:38] <codecutter> MikeD_: click on Europe
[08:42:21] <codecutter> i'd all the name of the country to be a url
[08:42:42] <codecutter> e.g. <a href="#">Turkey</a> etc
[08:42:57] <codecutter> understand?
[08:43:30] <MikeD_> i didn't see anything in the Highcharts that even lets you assign a click function...
[08:43:43] <MikeD_> what makes the click on europe redraw the countries?
[08:44:10] <codecutter> i think it has something to do with elevels
[08:44:23] <codecutter> do you understand what i mean?
[08:44:39] <codecutter> levels and dataLabels
[08:46:12] <MikeD_> are you comfortable reading specs like this for how to add your particular use case: http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/chart.events.click
[08:47:12] <MikeD_> perhaps instead of making the labels into literal <a> tags, you can attach a listener to the click event and cause navigation via script
[08:48:41] <codecutter> have a look at line 278 https://jsfiddle.net/aepu6dvt/11/
[08:49:18] <codecutter> if i add that block, then it applies the css but its visible from level 1
[08:49:28] <codecutter> if you go to level 2 then it disappears
[08:50:15] <codecutter> besides I don't want level 2 labels to visible from level 1, only when a particular option has been selected on level 1
[08:52:00] <codecutter> MikeD_: i think it has a style property but i'm sure where to apply it
[08:54:27] <MikeD_> highcharts seems pretty robust, so it's probable someone already wanted to do what you want to do... but there's so much feature you'll have to research how to get it
[08:54:38] <MikeD_> i'm not already familiar with that tool
[08:55:40] <codecutter> yes
[08:57:24] <MikeD_> damn, i wanted to ask him if the price of that package was feasible
[08:58:47] <MikeD_> oh, there's a non-commercial "free" option at the bottom of the list

[09:13:11] <Cork> :)
[09:14:18] <addin> how to hide table td nth-child columm
[09:15:55] <Cork> addin: simplest is to add a selector for it in your css and just add a class to the table
[09:16:34] <Cork> the alternative is to loop over all the matching cells and display: none; them (aka .hide())

[09:23:36] <Jer0meB51> and when i roll over a serie of div it merges the number of the data-*
[09:23:47] <Jer0meB51> can someone help me seeing the solution ?
[09:26:26] <MikeD_> you know css has an nth-child selector, right?
[09:26:52] <MikeD_> damn, the person i'm talking to already left
[09:27:54] <MikeD_> Jer0meB51: i suggest making a fiddle so you can get specific help rather than general words+words+words

[09:45:45] <sonu_nk> how to get html from jQuery obj  [ var $elem = $(formWrap + "[data-form-id='" + frmid + "']").append(form); ]
[09:46:22] <sonu_nk> $elem.html() is not working and $elem is jquery obj in console.
[09:58:06] <Cork> sonu_nk: it should work, what isn't working with it?
[09:59:33] <sonu_nk> var $elem = $(formWrap + "[data-form-id='" + frmid + "']").append(form); is obj as i can see obj in console. but when i try to get $elem.html(); its says undefined
[10:00:21] <Cork> sonu_nk: so $elem is defined in a function and you're tying to access it globally most likely
[10:03:48] <ether_> Could someone help me work through my JS and reformat it so it makes more sense?
[10:04:22] <sonu_nk> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/jxmxckL0/ please see here..
[10:04:35] <Cork> ether_: don't ask for someone get started at it and ask for help with specific problems you have
[10:05:41] <Cork> sonu_nk: do you want go get the div or just the content of it?
[10:05:51] <Cork> cause .html() will give you what is inside the formWrap div
[10:06:01] <ether_> Cork, I mean I have it set up. I'm creating a conversational-style chat but I'm storing all of the text in append() functions, and I'm not entirely sure how else I could do that: https://jsfiddle.net/e2mo1et5/
[10:06:50] <sonu_nk> Cork,  actally i am building the html using jquery and at last i want to print it so that user can get html source to copy.
[10:07:49] <Cork> ether_: depends on what you want to achieve
[10:08:07] <Cork> sonu_nk: try .prop('outerHTML')
[10:09:12] <ether_> It's working as a pre-selected conversation. I feel like there should be an easier way to store all of the text that the 'bot' would return, but I'm not 100% how to go about that, or what that solution would be
[10:09:19] <sonu_nk> Cork, same undefined
[10:09:25] <MikeD_> hmm... i didn't know you could get outerHTML via prop... i'd always use get().outerHTML
[10:10:36] <Cork> MikeD_: jqelm[0].outerHTML, jqelm.get(0).outerHTML, jqelm.prop('outerHTML') are all the same thing
[10:10:47] <Cork> i just find .prop('outerHTML') cleaner to read
[10:11:24] <Cork> MikeD_: .prop(property) does exactly elm[property]
[10:11:25] <MikeD_> absolutely, thanks for the tip
[10:11:38] <Cork> and that is why it works the same :)
[10:12:04] <MikeD_> i really don't like the jqelm[n] notation, it's too similar to an array and that's potentially confusing
[10:12:18] <Cork> MikeD_: but it is the same thing
[10:12:20] <Cork> not similar
[10:12:28] <sonu_nk> Cork, even var $elem = formWrap.attr("data-form-id", 2); is also not working i can see in obj, no presence
[10:12:44] <Cork> var jqelm = { outerHTML }; jqelm['outerHTML'] or jqelm.outerHTML
[10:13:01] <Cork> MikeD_: that is why they look similar cause it is exactly what they are
[10:13:24] <Cork> sonu_nk: is formWrap empty too?
[10:13:37] <Cork> (from what you explain it should be)
[10:14:05] <MikeD_> right, but native arrays lack the jquery methods - that's why i think i can be confusing to read - of course the functionality is the same
[10:14:20] <sonu_nk> its the var formWrap = $("div[data-form = '_form-render-wrap']"); ...means its first obj
[10:14:24] <Cork> MikeD_: you might find this interesting: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/attributes/prop.js#L26
[10:15:08] <Cork> MikeD_: i farily often write (not exactly but...) $()['html']('new html')
[10:15:13] <Cork> :)
[10:15:17] <sonu_nk> https://jsfiddle.net/jxmxckL0/1/ Cork
[10:15:26] <Cork> it has nothing to do with what you call it in, it is fundamental javascript syntax
[10:15:34] <Cork> *calling it on*
[10:16:12] <Cork> sonu_nk: https://jsfiddle.net/jxmxckL0/3/
[10:16:16] <Cork> verify line 2
[10:16:44] <Cork> sonu_nk: for one you have spaces around your = in the attribute selector
[10:16:52] <Cork> so i don't think that selector works
[10:19:06] <Cork> MikeD_: did you understand what i tried to explain there?
[10:19:23] <sonu_nk> Cork, i did this with $("<div/>", {
[10:19:24] <sonu_nk>   'data-form': '_form-render-wrap',
[10:19:24] <sonu_nk>   'data-form-id': 2,
[10:19:24] <sonu_nk> }); and working thanx
[10:19:38] <Cork> sonu_nk: uh...
[10:19:48] <Cork> that isn't even remotely close to the code you just used...
[10:20:00] <Cork> the old code was a selector, that one creates a detached element...
[10:21:53] <MikeD_> yeah

[12:21:43] <taplar_> $('table td').eq(0)
[12:22:09] <Violinist> whats eq(0)
[12:22:19] <Violinist> what about :first
[12:22:27] <taplar_> it gets the first element in the result set, keeping it as a jquery object
[12:22:37] <taplar_> i think css has a :first-child
[12:22:46] <taplar_> but i usually avoid pseudoselectors
[12:22:55] <Violinist> y
[12:23:12] <taplar_> sizzle has to interpret them and perform logic to make them work
[12:23:22] <taplar_> where as i can just get the first one and reap the speed benifits
[12:24:07] <Violinist> what if i know the table #id
[12:24:21] <taplar_> that's an id selector, super fast.  not a pseudoselector
[12:24:22] <MikeD_> taplar_: so "get all the td" and .eq(0) on the collection?
[12:24:29] <Violinist> $(This.kLocationTableId).find("td").eq(0)
[12:24:29] <taplar_> pseudo selectors are :something
[12:24:44] <taplar_> MikeD_: sure.
[12:24:55] <taplar_> scoped down as much as possible, of course
[12:25:06] <MikeD_> possibly better would be to just id the td itself
[12:25:11] <taplar_> sure
[12:25:35] <MikeD_> though if you are making a table of a single cell, you probably are doing it wrong in the first place
[12:25:52] <taplar_> he didn't say he was.  just needs to select it
[12:26:15] <taplar_> Violinist: what is that in the first $() ?
[12:26:26] <Violinist> some id
[12:26:30] <taplar_> a variable?
[12:26:32] <MikeD_> "how do i find the first td of table or any td in table coz thers only 1"
[12:26:32] <Violinist> ya
[12:26:33] <Violinist> lol
[12:26:43] <taplar_> i'm assume only one table MikeD_
[12:26:44] <Violinist> this is some crap core i ingerited
[12:26:59] <taplar_> does the variable have '#' in it?
[12:27:00] <MikeD_> haha, oh yeah i guess you could read it that way too
[12:27:09] <Violinist> ya
[12:27:16] <taplar_> ok, so yeah that's valid
[12:28:44] <Violinist> no its definitely invalid
[12:28:46] <Violinist> lol
[12:28:55] <taplar_> then console.log the value of the varialbe
[12:29:03] <Violinist> no i mean
[12:29:22] <Violinist> i would rather use templates
[12:29:37] <taplar_> ok?
[12:31:02] <Violinist> u know
[12:31:18] <Violinist> u want to do the math before u render
[12:31:34] <Violinist> ie logic
[12:31:43] <Violinist> not after
[12:32:18] <taplar_> i'm just unclear how we got to using a template being a reason that the syntax of the select was 'invalid'.  maybe not desired, but as you described it it would be valid, :P
[12:33:07] <Violinist> no i said this code is invalid
[12:33:56] <taplar_> ok, well.  i mean there's nothing that says you have to put it on the page before you find the stuff
[12:34:03] <taplar_> you can do selectors on dom fragments too
[12:34:18] <taplar_> but if the templating engine has a better way, abuse it
[12:35:09] <taplar_> though without it being on the page, afaik you wouldn't be able to do completely accurate math on it if you are relying on the elements to have the css applied to them already
[12:35:58] * taplar_ just thinking out loud
[13:00:03] <Violinist> any one see this message?
[13:00:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:00:12] <Violinist> could not load requested content
[13:00:20] <Violinist> its weird in ff
[13:00:26] <robertmaxrees> context?
[13:00:36] <Violinist> ?
[13:00:44] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting that error?
[13:00:57] <Violinist> trasitioning pages
[13:01:10] <robertmaxrees> is it a jquery issue?
[13:01:44] <Violinist> not sure
[13:02:16] <robertmaxrees> can you show us any details or anything?  really hard to help when there are so few details.
[13:02:59] <Violinist> what can i show lol
[13:03:09] <Violinist> its not in the code
[13:03:26] <robertmaxrees> can you show the page that ahs the error?
[13:05:00] <Violinist> its this fake ajaxify crap
[13:05:34] <robertmaxrees> what's that?
[13:06:05] <Violinist> exactly
[13:06:12] <Violinist> u dont want to know
[13:06:28] <robertmaxrees> sooooooo...
[13:06:31] <robertmaxrees> how can i help?
[13:07:09] <Violinist> yeah umm just sit tight i fixed it
[13:07:19] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[13:07:24] <Violinist> i had to remove this
[13:07:32] <Violinist> class="ajaxify"
[13:07:39] <Violinist> that told the link to do fake ajax
[13:07:43] <Violinist> lol
[13:07:44] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/browserstate/ajaxify this?
[13:07:48] <Violinist> ya
[13:07:49] <robertmaxrees> and what is "fake ajax"?
[13:07:59] <Violinist> i do not know
[13:08:04] <Violinist> its crap
[13:08:14] <robertmaxrees> that plugin doesn't do "fake ajax"
[13:13:32] <taplar_> fake ajax.  you think it's clean, but behold the remaining grime
[13:13:39] <robertmaxrees> hjahahaha
[13:13:49] <Es0teric> i want to add/remove a class on click.. whats the best way to approach that?
[13:14:12] <taplar_> sounds straight forward
[13:14:18] <taplar_> what are you concerns?
[13:14:25] <Es0teric> taplar_ well i have something that toggles
[13:14:36] <Es0teric> so... i just need a class to detect if it was toggled or not
[13:14:59] <taplar_> uh, what do you mean toggled?
[13:15:24] <taplar_> toggling affects the element in some way i assume.
[13:15:28] <Es0teric> are there other definitions for "toggled" aside from having something turned on/off?
[13:15:32] <Es0teric> im pretty sure thats what toggled means
[13:15:37] <taplar_> so a checkbox?
[13:15:47] <Es0teric> no
[13:16:09] <taplar_> so what effect does the toggle have on the element?
[13:16:28] <Es0teric> a click either displays a div or doesnt display it
[13:16:33] <Es0teric> simple
[13:16:35] <Es0teric> taplar_
[13:16:44] <taplar_> so the visibility of the div determines if it's toggled on or off?
[13:16:50] <Es0teric> yes
[13:16:54] <taplar_> so why not check that?
[13:17:00] <Es0teric> how?
[13:17:18] <taplar_> how are you show/hideing the div?
[13:17:39] <Es0teric> css is display:none; initially
[13:17:51] <Es0teric> then when the element is clicked, the div displays
[13:18:02] <Es0teric> using .toggle()
[13:18:04] <taplar_> by changing the inline css or?
[13:18:43] <codecutter> how can I change the size of font only in level 2 (countries not region) https://jsfiddle.net/aepu6dvt/10/
[13:18:51] <codecutter> highcharts*
[13:19:02] <taplar_> so if it is based entirely off of the inline css you can do $(divselector).css('display') === 'none'
[13:19:16] <Es0teric> taplar_ dude what does .toggle() really do?
[13:19:51] <Es0teric> well the inline css does get changed in the dom when the click occurs again
[13:20:34] <taplar_> yeah, toggle without classes toggles the inline display
[13:21:10] <taplar_> so checking if the display is 'none' or not tells you if it is on/off
[13:29:39] <taplar_> woah
[13:30:02] <Es0teric> taplar_ what if i want to find css that is not inline
[13:30:30] <taplar_> there is the :hidden and :visible pseudoselectors that will consider more things
[13:31:19] <taplar_> https://api.jquery.com/visible-selector/
[13:35:05] <taplar_> or you could create a css class that does the display: normal or whatever that makes it show, and then your logic could simply check for the existance of that class on the div
[13:35:46] <Violinist> i have something that tiggles
[13:36:15] <taplar_> no one likes a bragger
[13:36:26] <Violinist> i mean toggles
[13:36:38] <taplar_> :)
[13:37:36] <jilocasin0> afternoon all.
[13:38:16] <jilocasin0> I seem to be drawing a blank and I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction.
[13:39:09] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[13:39:15] <jilocasin0> I have a table with a single row selected, how (using jQuery) would I go about getting a data-foo-bar='' value from the selected <tr> element?
[13:40:40] <taplar_> you mean selected as in you have a variable that you've $(selectorForThatTr) ?
[13:42:30] <jilocasin0> taplar_: as in there's a table on the page and the user has selected a row.  Each <tr> element has a data-foo-bar='x' value.  When the user clicks on a button I want to find the data-foo-bar value from the selected row.
[13:42:48] <taplar_> ok, what denotes a tr as being selected?
[13:43:06] <jilocasin0> taplar_: data-foo-bar is an attribure of the tr element, it's NOT displayed in the table.
[13:43:26] <taplar_> yeah, i'm familiar with data elements
[13:43:41] <taplar_> but what makes them selected?
[13:44:37] <jilocasin0> as far as I can tell, it's a $().Datatable() table.  It has a 'selected' attribute on the tr element when the user selects it (I make sure that the table only has a single selected row at any time).
[13:45:04] <taplar_> so <stuff  selecte> ?
[13:45:08] <taplar_> so <stuff  selected> ?
[13:46:10] <jilocasin0> taplar_: Yep.  I've gotten as far as 'table.rows({selected: true})'  But no matter what I try I can only get what's _inside_ the <tr></tr> and not the element itself.
[13:46:57] <jilocasin0> taplar_: I could bruteforce the entire table, but it may contain many many rows and so was hoping that there was a more efficient jQueryish way to handle it.
[13:47:35] <taplar_> so what is the result of table.rows({selecteD: true})?
[13:47:58] <taplar_> if you console.log that what do you get?
[13:48:21] <jilocasin0> taplar: an array.
[13:48:27] <taplar_> of what?
[13:48:32] <jilocasin0> [object]
[13:48:39] <taplar_> JSON.stringify() it
[13:48:47] <taplar_> or expand it in the console and see what it is
[13:49:20] <jilocasin0> if I [object][0] I get an HTML object
[13:49:27] <taplar_> ok, so it's the tr
[13:49:42] <taplar_> yes?
[13:49:56] <jilocasin0> Nope, if iI just alert/console it, it's what's _inside_ the tr, not the tr itseld.
[13:50:05] <taplar_> hmm
[13:50:47] <jilocasin0> If I try .data() or .attr() I get .data/attr is not a function...
[13:51:02] <taplar_> right, those are jquery methods
[13:51:09] <taplar_> and this is ******* datatables
[13:51:23] <jilocasin0> I've even tried .to$() first, no joy
[13:51:28] <jilocasin0> yep.
[13:52:53] <taplar_> ok, so there is probably a datatables way of getting that but who likes DT
[13:52:58] <jilocasin0> taplar_: what I've seen (google/stackoverflow) all talk about getting the values *during* the click event by interogating the $(this) object.
[13:53:02] <taplar_> do you have an identifier for the table?
[13:53:06] <jilocasin0> Yep.
[13:53:10] <Violinist> any1 here graduate to webpack yet
[13:53:15] <jilocasin0> [unique even ;)]
[13:53:16] <hlve> <<
[13:53:19] <hlve> Loving webpack
[13:53:23] <Violinist> very well
[13:53:50] <hlve> There should be a jquery-discussion channel. I know the regulars in here don't like people having discussions in here while people are asking questions
[13:53:50] <hlve> lol
[13:54:01] <taplar_> so if you want to do pure jq you could do $(tableSelector).find('tr').filter('[selected]');
[13:54:19] <taplar_> then .data('fooBar')
[13:54:21] <jilocasin0> taplar: So I guess I'm back to select the table, and then looking for the 'selected' attribute....
[13:54:31] <jilocasin0> taplar_: I was afraid of that.
[13:54:49] * jilocasin0 shrugs
[13:55:29] <taplar_> or maybe something like this, idk, https://datatables.net/reference/api/rows().data()
[13:56:04] <jilocasin0> taplar_: that was where I started, you get the data *inside* the tr not the tr itself.
[13:58:05] <jilocasin0> taplar_: So if I had a table-> row0: Peter, 12, blue ; row1: Mary, 15, green and selected row1 I would get Mary, 15, green.
[13:58:49] <taplar_> so it's returning the data that is used to generate the cells
[13:59:58] <taplar_> Violinist: i've used gulp before as a compiler and bundler before.  never played with webpack
[14:00:16] <Violinist> yeah i believe webpack is beter than those
[14:00:18] <Violinist> try it
[14:00:25] <jilocasin0> taplar_: Yep,  which I guess for alot of use cases is what you're looking for, but in my case I need to grab identifiers (that aren't ID) form the tr element.
[14:02:02] <jilocasin0> taplar_:and of course this is all dynamic DOM manipulation which makes debugging a royal pain.... ;>
[14:02:37] <taplar_> did you try that jq selector string i suggested?
[14:02:43] <Violinist> hlve are u minifiy ur css
[14:03:02] <hlve> yep
[14:03:24] <Violinist> ok how do i do it
[14:03:55] <taplar_> err, if you guys are going to webpack it up, maybe find one of their rooms or go pm pls
[14:04:06] <hlve> see. no discussions.
[14:04:07] <hlve> >:
[14:04:36] <Violinist> lol
[14:04:47] <taplar_> we topic rooms for a reason man, :)
[14:11:52] <jilocasin0> taplar_: trying it now.I get [object Object]
[14:12:44] <jilocasin0> taplar_: .data('fooBar') == Undefined.
[14:13:02] <taplar_> what's the whole command?
[14:13:21] <jilocasin0> taplar_: var row = $("#purchaseOrdersVendorLookupTable-dataTable").find('tr').filter('[selected]');
[14:13:51] <jilocasin0> taplar_: console.log("row: " + row);
[14:14:04] <jilocasin0> taplar_:  alert('Selected ID: '+ row.data('purchaseOrderCompanyVendorId'));
[14:14:37] <taplar_> so your element has a data-purchase-order-company-vendor-id="something" on it?
[14:14:59] <jilocasin0> yep.  Every tr get a unique one from the table.
[14:15:14] <taplar_> ok, if you do just data() off of the row, what does that give you?
[14:16:59] <jilocasin0> taplar_:  row: undefined
[14:17:25] <taplar_> well that's strange
[14:17:42] <jilocasin0> taplar_: tell me about it.
[14:17:45] <taplar_> console.log($("#purchaseOrdersVendorLookupTable-dataTable").length);
[14:18:32] <jilocasin0> taplar_: 1
[14:19:02] <taplar_> console.log($("#purchaseOrdersVendorLookupTable-dataTable").find('tr').filter('[selected]').length);
[14:19:57] <jilocasin0> taplar_: 0
[14:20:07] <taplar_> so none of those rows have that attribute on them
[14:20:35] <taplar_> *at the time that is ran
[14:21:20] <jilocasin0> taplar_: I've got it.
[14:21:52] <jilocasin0> taplar_: selected is a _class_ so I needed to change [selected] to .selected.
[14:22:00] <taplar_> :)
[14:22:11] <taplar_> find('tr.selected')
[14:22:19] <taplar_> and remove the filter
[14:22:24] <jilocasin0> taplar_: I still have to filter the entire table, :(
[14:22:43] <taplar_> just the trs
[14:22:57] <taplar_> how many rows?
[14:23:38] <jilocasin0> taplar_: in my test data sets 2-20, in the actuall data up to several hundred.
[14:24:03] <taplar_> you're not doing paging?
[14:24:22] <taplar_> because if you do paging with DT then it should only search the ones that DT has drawn on the page at that time
[14:24:59] <taplar_> which if you are doing paging and the selected row can be on a page not currently visible, then this approach is flawed
[14:25:20] <jilocasin0> taplar_: yep, I'm paging, but that doesn't stop the user from entering 100 or more for the number of records to display.
[14:25:47] <taplar_> uh, so you're not limiting the maximum number of records to show?
[14:26:06] <jilocasin0> taplar_: I guess I'll run with it (too bad there wasn't a DataTables way).
[14:26:31] <taplar_> i'm not saying there isn't a DT way.  I just don't know it, :)
[14:26:33] <jilocasin0> taplar_: can't we have customers that want to be able to see _all_ the records at ones.
[14:26:40] <taplar_> not a lot of DT guru's hang out here
[14:26:44] <jilocasin0> taplar_: you and me both.
[14:27:06] <taplar_> the issue with displaying all the records, if there are a lot, is the potential for performance hits
[14:27:09] <jilocasin0> [ones == once]
[14:27:11] <taplar_> depending on how big the table gets
[14:27:18] <jilocasin0> don't I know it.
[14:27:24] <taplar_> which is the whole reason to implement paging
[14:28:13] * jilocasin0 thinks programming would be so much simpler *without* those pesky users.
[14:31:25] <hlve> lol
[14:42:37] <codecutter> How do i change the dataLabels for all Countries (not Region) into clickable link? https://jsfiddle.net/5ho5shtj/
[14:43:07] <codecutter> here is the highchart api http://api.highcharts.com/highcharts/
[14:43:47] <Woet> codecutter: what is your jquery question?
[14:44:27] <codecutter> this one's for the highchart hacks who maybe lurking in the room
[14:45:13] <codecutter> feel free to check it out.
[14:45:23] <codecutter> all welcome :)
[14:47:23] <jilocasin0> well thanks everyone (esp. taplar_).
[14:48:36] <codecutter>  jilocasin0: tapler is a good man
[14:48:45] <taplar_> lies
[14:48:53] <codecutter> woman?
[14:48:55] <codecutter> :)
[14:49:04] <taplar_> in this day and age, who knows
[14:58:20] <hlve> taplar_, that was an oddly worded comment lol
[14:58:30] <hlve> :#
[14:58:56] <taplar_> we live in a lgbt world man
[14:59:29] <robertmaxrees> or one without labels.
[14:59:36] <taplar_> ^
[14:59:41] * hlve shifty-eyes
[15:00:08] <hlve> we're about labels now more than ever lol
[15:00:56] <robertmaxrees> nah.  we're all about actually respecting people's choices.
[15:01:37] <hlve> peoples' choices about labels, got it.
[15:01:38] <hlve> ;0
[15:03:12] <robertmaxrees> heh, you should check out linguistic relativity.  pretty interesting concept.
[15:03:54] <codecutter> too many choices these days
[15:04:13] <hlve> there really aren't lol. Two sexes, and sexual preference. Nothing has changed scientifically.
[15:04:14] <hlve> lol
[15:04:38] <codecutter> or shall i say 'labels'
[15:05:21] <hlve> robertmaxrees, words have always had the opportunity to change world view though lol.
[15:05:23] <robertmaxrees> heh, this is where i'ma ask that we not go any further.
[15:05:38] <codecutter> wise man
[15:05:41] <robertmaxrees> feel free to PM me though.
[15:05:48] * hlve shrugs
[15:06:08] <codecutter> pm? what the huck for? lol
[15:06:16] <robertmaxrees> if you wanna keep talking about it.
[15:06:21] <robertmaxrees> just wanna keep it outta the channel.
[15:07:10] <codecutter> he is politely telling us to shut the heck up lol
[15:07:28] <codecutter> or is it a she?
[15:07:31] <codecutter> :)
[15:07:48] <robertmaxrees> hahaha. more like I'm trying to just be aware that this is, indeed, a super charged topic that can quickly get derailed and likely doesn't add much to the channel.
[15:07:50] <taplar_> it's Pat
[15:08:30] <hlve> like I said there really should be a dev-discussion channel that people hung out in to discuss random, offtopic topics
[15:08:30] <hlve> lol
[15:08:46] <taplar_> #freenode
[15:09:09] <robertmaxrees> hlve you mean an offtopic discussion channel ;) and you can make one if you'd like.  the foundation likely doesn't want to create something like that for good reason.
[15:09:36] <hlve> (thats why I left jquery out of the name ;P)
[15:09:42] <MikeD_> who is "the foundation" ?
[15:09:59] <robertmaxrees> technically the JS Foundationm
[15:10:03] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_
[15:10:05] <hlve> wat
[15:10:16] <MikeD_> hmm... still sounds ominous
[15:10:17] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:10:30] <hlve> all good. I'll stop talking aboot it.
[15:10:33] <robertmaxrees> https://js.foundation/community/projects
[15:10:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:11:34] <robertmaxrees> jquery is run by the JS Foundation, which is a Linux Foundation project.
[15:12:17] <MikeD_> :)
[15:15:09] <MikeD_> there are some neat (-sounding) projects there
[15:20:13] <hlve> why does the Linux Foundation own so many sub-foundations?
[15:20:15] <hlve> O_o.
[15:27:46] <sopparus> Cork, are you still here?
[15:28:36] * hlve slaps Cork with a trout.
[15:29:58] <sopparus> anyways, he showed me how to use data: { data: JSON.stringify($('input').serializeArray()),
[15:30:12] <sopparus> but it doesnt seem to work on select or option (dropdown)
[15:30:15] <sopparus> what am I missing?
[15:30:45] <MikeD_> what is serializeArray() ?
[15:48:38] <nikio_> i can set a click handler on a jquery object before it gets appended to a dom item
[15:48:52] <nikio_> but i cant reference it in the click handler itself can i
[15:49:53] <nikio_> im asking because im dealing with a checkbox item that has a click handler and sets an under lying object to active or inactive.. but sometimes when i click fast the objects state stops corresponding to the checkbox being checked
[15:50:11] <nikio_> so then the underlying object becomes inactive while the checkbox is checked
[15:50:32] <nikio_> because of click events and object state getting out of tune due to fast clicks

[18:20:28] <Ali_nz1> Hi guys. trying to get the date value out of the picker : https://jsfiddle.net/ee2t182s/
[18:31:04] <robertmaxrees> Ali_nz1 this using jqui?
[18:31:50] <Ali_nz1> yes
[18:31:56] <Ali_nz1> well jquery
[18:32:01] <robertmaxrees> with bootstrap?
[18:32:05] <Ali_nz1> yes
[18:32:34] <robertmaxrees> https://eonasdan.github.io/bootstrap-datetimepicker/Functions/#date
[18:35:43] <Ali_nz1> so lemme check I understand this correctly. I should be able to use a jquery selector followed by .date() to get current value? like $(jqueryselector).date(); ?
[18:40:47] <robertmaxrees> " Note All functions are accessed via the data attribute e.g. $('#datetimepicker').data("DateTimePicker").FUNCTION() "
[18:40:51] <robertmaxrees> at the top of that page.
[18:41:29] <Ali_nz1> robertmaxrees: bingo - thanks
[18:58:40] <Al_nz1> if the result from that select is : Moment {_isAMomentObject: true, _isUTC: false, _pf: Object, _locale: Locale, _d: Mon May 08 2017 10:38:40 GMT+1200 (New Zealand Standard Time)} : should i be able to convert that to DD/MM/YYYY with : var formatted = moment(value).format('DD/MM/YYYY'); :
[19:04:54] <robertmaxrees> is that not working?
[19:06:18] <robertmaxrees> 'cause according to https://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/ that should work.
[19:07:12] <Al_nz1> yip - all going
