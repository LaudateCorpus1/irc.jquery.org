[00:03:49] <sebb_> no ideas how to achive thing ive described ?
[00:22:38] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/q8Lf96ud/5/ why am I getting a 404 here?
[00:32:50] <Cork> Kartagis: you're don't getting 404, you're still trying to do cors when the server doesn't allow it
[00:33:02] <Cork> i answered this yesterday
[00:34:04] <Kartagis> Cork: the server allows it, I've made sure yesterday. I'm just getting a not found on line #14
[00:34:12] <Kartagis> {{images}}
[00:36:16] <Cork> ah
[00:36:26] <Cork> you're trying to load the template as a resource
[00:36:51] <Uhkis> it's pretty obvious that <img src="{{images}}"> is 404
[00:44:19] <Ankabout> Hi there. I was wondering if someone can help me with this... I need to check if a page is fully loaded (all DOMs, and all resources etc) before a JS function triggers...
[00:44:43] <Cork> Ankabout: use the load event
[00:45:01] <Cork> though that won't be enough if you load content through ajax
[00:45:11] <Ankabout> Currently I use $(document).ready(function(){   but that's not enough, some items are not loaded yet when that calls
[00:45:45] <toomus> Cork: I have question, but not exactly with jQuery. Can I ask you?
[00:46:46] <Cork> toomus: ask the question in a channel related to the question
[00:47:05] <Cork> toomus: and normally don't direct them to a specific person unless the person personally asked for an answer
[00:47:18] <Cork> if ppl know the answer they will answer (if they are around)
[00:47:29] <Ankabout> Cork: So I could use $(body).load(function(){  for example? Would that be more accurate than document ready?
[00:47:42] <Cork> Ankabout: yes, .ready is a compatibility function around DOMContentLoaded
[00:47:53] <toomus> Cork: I just like your opinions :)
[00:47:55] <Cork> it fires as soon as the original dom has been parsed
[00:48:16] <Cork> Ankabout: by design it doesn't wait for ex. iframes, videos and images
[00:48:29] <Ankabout> ah ok, thanks
[00:48:42] <Cork> Ankabout: the load event is an older event, and it fires when the page has loaded; though note this does NOT include ajax requests
[00:48:44] <Uhkis> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/q8Lf96ud/6/
[00:49:44] <Kartagis> yay
[00:49:52] <Kartagis> thanks so much :)
[00:50:09] <Uhkis> next time read the docs so we don't have to ;)
[00:54:18] <Ankabout> Cork: seems I have Jquery 1.8.2 and Load() was deprecated in 1.8?
[00:54:27] <Cork> no
[00:54:35] <Cork> ?api load
[00:54:35] <b-ot> Cork: .load(): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[00:54:40] <Cork> ?api load event
[00:55:05] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[00:55:13] <Cork> ah
[00:55:26] <Kartagis> Uhkis: you mean you had to read the docs and you didn't know beforehand?
[00:55:26] <Cork> interesting, they've deprecated the shorthand, haven't seen that
[00:55:35] <Cork> Ankabout: just use .bind('load', func)
[00:55:57] <Uhkis> Kartagis: yes, first time ever doing anything with mustache
[00:55:58] <Cork> Ankabout: btw deprecated != removed
[00:56:13] <Cork> Ankabout: it just means .load will most likely be removed in 3.0 or something like that
[00:56:24] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I hardly make anything work by reading docs :S
[00:56:39] <Kartagis> Cork: I thought bind was deprecated as well
[00:56:50] <Cork> Kartagis: no it sint'
[00:57:00] <Kartagis> as of 1.7?
[00:57:02] <Cork> Kartagis: no
[00:57:06] <Kartagis> weird
[00:57:09] <Kartagis> okay
[00:57:17] <Cork> Kartagis: what many takes as deprecated is that they say "on is preferred"
[00:57:28] <Cork> it is not even remotly to the same
[00:57:58] <Kartagis> Cork: I somehow got the impression .on replaced .bind
[00:58:00] <Cork> and that was from 1.9 not 1.7
[00:58:06] <Cork> Kartagis: it doesn't
[00:58:12] <Kartagis> okay
[00:58:22] <Cork> .on is a combination function that can do both .bind and .delegate
[00:58:31] <Kartagis> oh
[00:58:35] <Kartagis> gotcha
[00:58:50] <Cork> but .bind has so much history, and supporting it requires so little code that there is little point in removing it
[00:59:27] <Cork> it would be like renaming $.ajax to $.fetch just cause it "sounds better"
[00:59:52] <Cork> it creates compatibility cost for close to no benefit
[01:00:26] <Ankabout> Cork: Thanks. Trying it out now...
[01:02:52] <Cork> Kartagis: this is literally all the code in .bind http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.fn.bind
[01:03:06] <Ankabout> Strange.... $(".html").bind('load', function() {   doesn't fire.
[01:03:07] <Cork> a one liner :)
[01:03:16] <Ankabout> my body has a .html class
[01:03:31] <Cork> Ankabout: $(document).bind('load'
[01:07:58] <Ankabout> Cork: Can it be that a document ready and a document bind can't work next to each other?
[01:08:09] <Cork> nope
[01:08:59] <Ankabout> so strange. It won't fire for me, and as a fucntion I only put console.log() as a test. No logging, and no errors.
[01:09:24] <DarkSector_> Hey guys, I am not sure if this is a jQuery issue or a chart.js issue or even a simple JavaScript issue, but I have been trying to figure out why this isn't working even when the Ajax call is successful http://pastie.org/private/lueabslo462lueiw5d6kgw#91-93,97,166-167,172,241-243,247,316-317,322
[01:09:35] <DarkSector_> Can anyone please help me out?
[01:10:22] <DarkSector_> I am trying to emulate this behavior http://jsbin.com/yitep/5/edit
[01:10:41] <DarkSector_> But instead of using Math.random() I am getting data from ajax.get()
[01:11:45] <grek> hi maybe someone can help - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29749891/set-initial-data-in-selec2-with-ajax
[01:11:50] <Xatenev> Anybody has experience with the datetimepicker plugin from jquery?
[01:11:58] <DarkSector_> I can see the data correctly but whenever I try to plot it, I get this https://imgur.com/A1qfYkN
[01:12:02] <night-owl> hey guys, im trying to figure out why the filter for jQuery ui's selectable component doesnt seem to be working how I'm expecting it.  I have a container that is bootstrapped with the selectable component.  The filter is 'div:empty', so it should only allow elements with no children to be selected.  However, when I add children to one of the elements, it is still selectable. To test it, click 'Split Horizontal', then select one of the partitions
[01:12:02] <night-owl>  and select 'Split Horizontal' once again.  When you try and select the new children, the parent is still selectable. http://codepen.io/anon/pen/wawVBe
[01:12:11] <night-owl> Pertinent js is from lines 19 and down
[01:12:56] <night-owl> Xatenev: ive worked with it
[01:13:00] <Cork> gah..
[01:13:11] <Cork> Ankabout: was a bit since i last used it, its on window not document
[01:13:20] <Cork> Ankabout: http://jsfiddle.net/675kec66/
[01:13:41] <night-owl> anyone mind taking a look? or if theres somewhere more effective to ask :p
[01:13:46] <DarkSector_> Hello, Can anyone please tell me why this code doesn't seem to work. http://pastie.org/private/lueabslo462lueiw5d6kgw#91-93,97,166-167,172,241-243,247,316-317,322
[01:13:50] <DarkSector_> err sorry
[01:14:03] <night-owl> Xatenev: have a question about the datetimepicker?
[01:14:17] <Cork> DarkSector_: create a working jsfiddle
[01:14:37] <DarkSector_> Cork how do I emulate .get() request"
[01:14:59] <Cork> DarkSector_: jsfiddle has an echo service
[01:15:04] <DarkSector_> oh
[01:15:05] <DarkSector_> okay
[01:15:13] <Cork> http://doc.jsfiddle.net/use/echo.html
[01:16:31] <Xatenev> not anymore, fixed night-owl
[01:16:39] <night-owl> k
[01:18:16] <Ankabout> Cork: Thanks, I got it to fire finally. Now just to get my function actually working and I'm all set! Thanks for the help
[01:21:00] <DarkSector_> Cork I somehow can't get canvas working
[01:21:19] <DarkSector_> https://jsfiddle.net/vwxvpeLg/
[01:23:18] <night-owl> strange, so if i append a new element that has children on append, they aren't selectable, but if i append an empty element, then add children, it is selectable..
[01:28:42] <DarkSector_> Anyone know why this isn't running? The chart just doesn't seem to be showing https://jsfiddle.net/vwxvpeLg/2/
[01:35:38] <kokut> Hello, is there a way to clear the way an element is displayed? because static leaves the element in the position and if i rotate the screen it keeps looking like it is instead of adopting the new width.
[01:36:50] <Cork> kokut: not sure what you mean by clear
[01:37:07] <kokut> refresh
[01:37:10] <Cork> kokut: how an element is displayed is controlled by what css rules is applied to it
[01:37:23] <Cork> there isn't a cache, so nothing to "refresh"
[01:37:24] <kokut> Cork: yea but i added some jquery to make it sticky at the top of the page
[01:37:35] <kokut> and it changes position to static
[01:37:53] <Cork> then you have to trigger on resize and the like to movie it when the screen gets resized
[01:38:19] <kokut> Cork: yea how can i do that
[01:38:27] <Cork> O_o
[01:38:33] <Cork> i just told you how...
[01:38:55] <kokut> oh lol
[01:39:41] <kokut> Cork: could you explain it a lil bit better?
[01:39:51] <Cork> ?mdn resize
[01:39:52] <b-ot> Cork: resize - CSS | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/resize
[01:40:01] <Cork> uh
[01:40:04] <Cork> ?mdn resize event
[01:40:04] <b-ot> Cork: resize - Event reference | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/resize
[01:40:10] <Cork> ^ that
[01:42:48] <kokut> Cork: i dont really get it
[01:43:01] <Cork> what don't you get?
[01:44:54] <kokut> Cork: how to even listen to the resize event
[01:45:07] <Cork> kokut: you bind it, to the window
[01:45:25] <Cork> "Target    defaultView (window)"
[01:45:59] <kokut> like window.addEventListener('resize', resize); and then function resize() {...} ?
[01:46:08] <kokut> just like that?
[01:46:20] <Cork> uh no
[01:46:29] <Cork> $(window).on('resize', func)
[01:46:48] <Cork> unless you don't use jquery that is, but then you're kinda asking in the wrong channel
[01:47:11] <kokut> func is the name of the function right?
[01:47:44] <Cork> or an inline
[01:47:53] <Cork> you've written an event handler before right?!?
[01:48:06] <kokut> i think so
[01:48:53] <toomus> How to add new data- attribute to element?
[01:49:13] <Cork> toomus: normally you don't have to
[01:49:26] <Cork> just use .data and it stores it in the jquery data cache
[01:59:09] <toomus> Cork: Maybe I'm trying to do this wrong way. I want to mark one div in set as edit mode. Only one div at the same time can be in edit mode. So when user want to start edit mode in some div, I must find old one in edit mode and unmark it. Maybe I should just operate on classes?
[01:59:55] <furoido> question for anyone using google calendar API
[01:59:56] <Cork> toomus: just set a class sounds like a good choice ya
[02:00:14] <furoido> is there it possible to get the color of the event or calendar set on google calendar?
[02:00:39] <Cork> furoido: => #google
[02:20:23] <Germanaz0> Hello everybody, I've a queston but is more related with CSS xD, the @import support the schema "//" instead use "https://" or "http://" ?
[02:20:43] <eNTi_> hi. does anyone have experience with jquery event handlers + mvc razor? i can't get my event handler attached to an input. i guess, because the page isn't fully loaded, but i've read up on the problem and now i'm using "$(document).on('click', '.myid input', function() { ...". is there any way to tell if the .myid input can ever by found by .on()?
[02:21:05] <Cork> Germanaz0: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/@import
[02:21:17] <Cork> it supports <uri> so should support all normal urls
[02:22:37] <Germanaz0> and "//" is a normal url ?
[02:22:51] <Germanaz0> like @import(//something.com/font.css)
[02:23:10] <Cork> that isn't a valid url no
[02:23:36] <Cork> :// is though
[02:24:07] <Cork> Germanaz0: though you prob don't want to use @import for cross domain css inclution
[02:24:19] <Cork> it doesn't work that well with caches and so on
[02:24:27] <Germanaz0> I want for google fonts
[02:25:14] <Cork> Germanaz0: gah... sorry you where right the colon isn't suppose to be there (had a blank out...)
[02:25:41] <Cork> anyway leaving out the protocol is a valid support url yes
[02:25:41] <slax0r> doesn't // simply mean "use the same protocol"?
[02:25:47] <Cork> it does
[02:26:20] <Germanaz0> so it is wrong or not
[02:26:23] <Germanaz0> to put "//"
[02:26:30] <Cork> its valid
[02:26:44] <Germanaz0> because for some reason I was getting some issues
[02:28:05] <Cork> Germanaz0: http://jsfiddle.net/0tsnt3rf/
[02:28:41] <Germanaz0> yes it works very good
[02:29:10] <Germanaz0> now the other question is that I was reading mozilla doc and they put @import("url") instead @import(url)
[02:29:38] <Xatenev> doesnt matter i think
[02:30:10] <Cork> Germanaz0: urls in css is normally represented as url(string)
[02:30:34] <Cork> Germanaz0: a few properties that where defined early on doesn't do this though
[02:30:42] <Cork> Germanaz0: so they support a syntax without the url()
[02:30:47] <Cork> @import is one of them
[02:30:47] <b-ot> Cork: memorised “import”.
[02:30:52] <Cork> <_<
[02:30:58] <Cork> b-ot: forget import
[02:31:07] <Cork> guess not
[02:31:27] <Germanaz0> nice tips, thanks
[02:31:31] <Germanaz0> I was a bit confused
[02:32:25] <Germanaz0> but is not a good practice to use @import for css fonts ?
[02:33:04] <Cork> Germanaz0: i would be a bit careful with it, but it isn't exactly bad practice
[02:33:37] <Germanaz0> because I hate to load all them on the <head>
[02:33:45] <Germanaz0> I prefer to have a css file that import fonts
[02:34:01] <Cork> Germanaz0: it will slow down loading a little
[02:34:13] <Cork> cause it has to load the page, parse the page, then load the css
[02:34:24] <Germanaz0> and get cached after ?
[02:34:26] <Cork> and parse the css before it even knows it needs to load the additional css
[02:35:02] <Cork> how much depends on how long it tales to get the css from the server
[02:35:10] <Cork> and how big the "main" css is
[02:35:18] <Germanaz0> true
[02:35:58] <Cork> and that is why i said one should be careful with it
[02:36:29] <Cork> you normally don't want too long chains of loading, cause if something is slow it escalates cross the resources
[02:36:38] <Cork> and you get a magnification of the load effect
[03:13:39] <garethdaine> Anyone got any experiebce with Redactor?

[04:26:49] <fabio_> how do i get the closest form name?
[04:27:00] <fabio_> $(this).closest("form").name()
[04:27:08] <fabio_> this not work
[04:27:21] <Uhkis> .attr('name')
[04:27:31] <fabio_> Uhkis, thanks mate
[04:33:52] <nir0> hi guys. how do i know if window is opened on mobile phone?
[04:40:12] <ManicPanic> is there a performance drain when using jquery ajax, rather than native xmlHttpRequest ?
[04:44:18] <pauled> !help please, can you help me to get a a link from this form http://en.lichess.org/?any#hook
[04:45:07] <pauled> Trying to get something like en.lichess.org/setup/hook/uid-placeholder?variant=1&timeMode=1
[04:46:12] <pauled> want a userscript to manage saved bookmarks seek
[05:16:04] <fabio_> how to get input value from the closest form?
[05:38:46] <eNTi_> could someone take a look at https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=LntAF3Iupo and help me getting this to work?
[05:39:23] <Cork> eNTi_: explain what you want help with so ppl can see if they can help
[05:39:30] <Cork> 2. you've forgotten to save
[05:39:34] <eNTi_> oh
[05:40:03] <eNTi_> change radio list which should change the style of the img
[05:40:21] <Cork> ok, so hit save and post the new link
[05:40:58] <eNTi_> hmm it's the same link still
[05:41:20] <Cork> you should get a https://jsfiddle.net/<hash>/1 link
[05:41:21] <eNTi_> https://jsfiddle.net/7sjh1rdv/#&togetherjs=LntAF3Iupo
[05:41:36] <Cork> ooh...
[05:41:47] <Cork> eNTi_: you should use .css for changing styles
[05:41:49] <Cork> no attr
[05:42:03] <Cork> and actually... you should be using a class instead
[05:42:25] <eNTi_> well... the click doesn't even register
[05:42:41] <eNTi_> so the event isn't attached to the input
[05:42:48] <eNTi_> i don't understand why
[05:43:51] <eNTi_> ah
[05:43:56] <eNTi_> now i get it
[05:43:57] <eNTi_> thx
[05:44:38] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/7sjh1rdv/2/
[05:44:42] <Cork> eNTi_: ^
[05:44:51] <Cork> you had quite a bit of errors in the code
[05:45:36] <eNTi_> thx.
[05:45:44] <eNTi_> i'm pretty new to this
[05:47:46] <Cork> eNTi_: and a fully fixed version https://jsfiddle.net/7sjh1rdv/3/
[05:48:16] <eNTi_> why is "name" better?
[05:49:16] <Cork> cause what you have only caught one of the states
[05:49:23] <Cork> the color state
[05:49:38] <Cork> the click on switching back to monocrome wasn't caught
[05:51:04] <Cork> eNTi_: note, filter doesn't work in firefox esr
[05:51:23] <Cork> just so you don't get caught by surprise by that later
[05:52:06] <eNTi_>  -webkit-filter: grayscale(1); ?
[05:52:22] <Cork> webkit is safari/chrome
[05:52:33] <Cork> filter: grayscale(1) works in firefox 35+
[05:52:36] <sammich> new Opera
[05:52:41] <eNTi_> oh... what is firefox esr?
[05:52:46] <sammich> not like anyone's noticed
[05:52:53] <Cork> Enterprice Support Release
[05:53:01] <Cork> they update once every 6 month
[05:53:07] <Cork> and they are still on ff 31
[05:53:10] <eNTi_> i'm using firefox developer edition to test my stuff
[05:53:19] <sammich> like Ubuntu LTS
[05:53:23] <eNTi_> soo... what does work for esr?
[05:53:28] <Cork> that would be ff 38 or 39 then
[05:53:39] <Cork> eNTi_: external svg file with the filter
[05:53:45] <eNTi_> wtf
[05:53:49] <eNTi_> no thx :D
[05:53:49] <Cork> ?mdn filter
[05:53:50] <b-ot> Cork: Array.prototype.filter() - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[05:53:54] <Cork> lol
[05:53:56] <Cork> ?mdn css filter
[05:53:57] <b-ot> Cork: CSS filters - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter
[05:54:09] <Cork> eNTi_: it isn't actually that bad
[05:54:15] <Cork> eNTi_: and you should only use it as a fallback
[05:54:31] <eNTi_> ok thx for the advice
[05:54:39] <sammich> transition + filter = baaaaad performance
[05:54:51] <sammich> but it looks really good when you're on a decent machine
[05:55:16] <xqo> hey, how do i make javascript objects inherit from other objects correctly? im trying to make my Struct object be able to use DataView methods, such as getUint8: http://jsfiddle.net/8906fvcv/1/
[05:55:22] <sammich> blur() in particular
[05:55:24] <Cork> depends a lot on that filter you use though
[05:55:28] <Cork> some filters are fast
[05:55:34] <Cork> like grayscale for example
[05:55:49] <sammich> yeah, I did a blur background when a modal popped up
[05:56:24] <sammich> we're not quite there yet, plus it kinda gets in the way of the user seeing what they were doing before
[05:57:08] <Cork> sammich: ya, firefox used svg blur when they implemented there new alert styling
[05:57:25] <Cork> they had to revert to a simple opacity cause it killed performance on some computers
[05:57:30] <Cork> blur can be really nasty
[05:58:05] <sammich> a really low radius blur would work
[05:59:01] <sammich> not speaking about performance, though
[06:00:44] <sammich> I wish that ES6 went a little further than just sugar for their class implementation
[06:01:00] <sammich> I want to call a super method with the same name
[06:01:02] <Cork> sammich: most of es6 is just syntax sugger
[06:01:21] <Cork> the underlying engine still only use prototype
[06:01:35] <Cork> well "only" :)
[06:01:44] <Cork> i personally don't have a problem with prototype
[06:02:27] <sammich> well, I have a super with a sub which also had a sub of that. And I wanted this nice clean calling pattern
[06:06:50] <sammich> maybe I should learn typescript
[06:14:41] <sammich> oooh, typescript might work for me
[06:15:12] <MikeD_> is there a way to prevent IE from reloading when you hit enter in an input?  it's not even in a form (so technically, that's wrong already, i know)
[06:15:42] <sammich> can you preventDefault on onSubmit?
[06:16:16] <MikeD_> onSubmit of what though?
[06:16:34] <sammich> experiment
[06:16:45] <sammich> I'd try the input first
[06:18:38] <notchris> Even if CORS is allowed, is there anyway to grab a form from one site and have it work correctly on the other?
[06:18:45] <notchris> Without an iFrame
[06:19:55] <sammich> oh crap. you can call overridden properties from the subclass!
[06:20:13] <sammich> my fault for not experimenting with it. This. Changes. Everything.
[06:20:17] <sammich> I don't hate ES6 anymore
[06:31:09] <Kartagis> var stuffImg = {images: images}; is an array, right?
[06:31:18] <Kartagis> javascript array
[06:31:38] <decx> it's an object
[06:34:49] <Kartagis> decx: so, I think I need an array of objects. is a notation like var stuff=[{images:images},{title:ttl}] correct?
[06:36:15] <decx> i dont know what you need, but yes that would be an array of objects
[06:40:34] <tomasm-> hi, how can I detect whether a navbar  (ul with li  float:left) is taking up two lines or one? i thought I could compare $(ul).height() > $(ul li).height(), but there may a margin on the li's, which height() excludes
[06:40:52] <xqo> i think its easier to understand this: http://jsfiddle.net/8906fvcv/9/ How can I make the Cat object inherit from DataView?
[06:41:17] <Cork> ?api outerHeight @ tomasm-
[06:41:17] <b-ot> tomasm-: .outerHeight(): Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding, border, and optionally margin. Returns an integer (without "px") representation of the value or null if called on an empty set of elements. http://api.jquery.com/outerHeight/
[06:41:56] <Cork> tomasm-: there isn't any direct indication for if the elements wrap or not
[06:45:49] <tomasm-> Cork, yeah  so im not quite  sure of the best way to check.... maybe the  UL will have padding... I am  trying to dynamically shrink  the font until the navbar only takes one  line (too many items)... maybe ensuring ul.height < li.outerHeight(true)*2 will work? i think I need to just eensure it's less  height than 2 LI's rather than require it be same as one LI....  since UL may have padding,  border etc
[06:50:48] <Cork> tomasm-: something i've seen getting used is checking the left position of one of the lis
[06:51:00] <Cork> tomasm-: and as it wraps this number gets lower
[06:51:12] <tomasm-> hmmm
[06:51:20] <Cork> tomasm-: that said though, what is the problem you're trying to solve?
[06:52:07] <tomasm-> making  sure my variable  item navigation doesnt wrap to two lines.... it may require  some font-size or li padding adjustment
[06:52:53] <Cork> tomasm-: an option is to make the line inline instead of float
[06:53:01] <Cork> tomasm-: then you can do it with white-space: nowrap
[06:53:18] <tomasm-> but wont the  nav items overflow if there  are too many?
[06:53:30] <Cork> sure
[06:53:45] <Cork> ah, sorry missed the padding adjustment
[06:53:58] <Cork> tomasm-: the best solution for that would be to use @media queries
[06:54:11] <Cork> check the width of the screen and adjust the css rules based on that
[06:54:26] <Cork> (if you do it in css you won't get the jittering js can't prevent)
[06:54:47] <decx> media tags will do it if you know how many items your menu will have
[06:54:59] <Cork> ya
[06:55:04] <decx> i think i used offsetTop in a similar situation where i didnt
[06:55:06] <tomasm-> yes but how do I know what font-size to set it to? it could be  any number, regardless  of the container size
[06:55:20] <tomasm-> decx, no it's variable item
[06:55:40] <Cork> tomasm-: you would have to define those
[06:55:59] <Cork> but ya, if it gets too undefined you will have to use js
[06:56:06] <decx> oh i see cork already suggested checking offsetLeft
[06:56:11] <decx> same principle
[06:56:26] <decx> offsetLeft gets smaller suddenly or offsetTop gets bigger
[06:56:35] <Thomas_Bas> Hello Guys, i got a problem with cross domains, i have setup everything on my server, but it looks like it waiting for a crossdomain.xml
[06:56:38] <Cork> yup
[06:56:57] <Thomas_Bas> it's a post formulaire in ajax
[06:57:05] <Cork> Thomas_Bas: is the cross domain server allowing cors?
[06:57:11] <Thomas_Bas> yes i allow : *
[06:57:22] <Cork> ok, and the "problem" is?
[06:58:09] <Cork> Thomas_Bas: for post the receiving server have to answer an OPTIONS request
[06:58:22] <Cork> Thomas_Bas: it isn't enough to just set the * on the post response
[06:58:43] <Thomas_Bas> yes
[06:58:51] <Thomas_Bas> OPTIONS, POST,GET,PUT
[06:58:59] <Thomas_Bas> i put full cfg to make my test
[06:59:30] <Thomas_Bas> but it looks like it works but from my page http i post in ajax my form to my https page
[06:59:58] <Thomas_Bas> and i get redirected to my https page w/o datas
[07:00:35] <Cork> Thomas_Bas: you're very vague on what the problem is
[07:00:50] <Cork> it makes it extremely hard to answer
[07:01:09] <Thomas_Bas> https://xxxxxxx  was loaded over a secure connection, but contains a form which targets an insecure endpoint  'http://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
[07:01:15] <Cork> ...
[07:01:31] <Thomas_Bas> This endpoint should be made available over a secure connection.
[07:02:10] <Thomas_Bas> Chrome telling me this
[07:20:33] <PereP> hi all
[07:23:47] <BillCriswell> Is there a way to trigger a drop event on a droppable and set the ui.draggable to a particular draggable?
[07:23:50] <PereP> I'm trying by all means to get a drop down (option) list to get out the borders of a jquery ui dialog using "ye olde" method of an absolutely positioned element inside a relative one and adjusting z-indexes accordingly
[07:24:33] <Cork> PereP: absolute won't help inside an overflow parent
[07:24:53] <Cork> and the content of jquery ui dialog is overflow: auto
[07:24:59] <PereP> I've lost the entire morning with this just to get either the overflow hidden outside the limits of the dialog or the dialog growing vertically to accomodate the new height of the content when the list is dropped down
[07:25:12] <PereP> ouch
[07:25:14] <Cork> PereP: you can't
[07:25:24] <PereP> thanks for the hint, Cork
[07:25:36] <Cork> only way to get outside a parent that has overflow: hidden/auto/scroll is to change it to overflow: visible;
[07:25:49] <PereP> by the way, forgive me by my English... I'm feeling messy today
[07:26:12] <Cork> BillCriswell: not sure that is actually doable
[07:26:23] <mooncup> 16:26 < Cork> BillCriswell: not sure that is actually doable
[07:26:26] * mooncup does a doubletake
[07:26:31] <BillCriswell> Cork: That's the impression I'm getting.
[07:26:37] <Cork> BillCriswell: i've been fiddling this the underpinnings of jquery ui
[07:26:43] <Cork> and .. lests see now
[07:26:52] <Cork> i THINK draggable extends ui.mouse
[07:27:01] <Cork> and ui.mouse is about as deep as you get
[07:27:08] <BillCriswell> I'll just need to make it a function I can call anywhere haha.
[07:27:13] <BillCriswell> Cork: Ah, fun.
[07:27:14] <Cork> you could have a look in that plugin and see if there is something there you can trigger
[07:27:48] <PereP> Cork, I'm going to try changing overflow to visible in the dialog
[07:28:06] <PereP> but I suspect there will be something else involved
[07:28:08] <PereP> xD
[07:28:10] <BillCriswell> Cork: Thanks for confirming. I was feeling crazy haha
[07:28:11] <Cork> BillCriswell: yup: $.widget("ui.draggable", $.ui.mouse, {
[07:28:32] <Cork> BillCriswell: http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.3/jquery-ui.js
[07:28:38] <Cork> search for var mouse = $.widget("ui.mouse", {
[07:28:42] <Cork> happy reading :)
[07:29:31] <BillCriswell> Yeah... I'm just going to have to make a function I can call in multiple places on drop lol
[07:41:21] <tomasm-> hi, I am having trouble  getting a consistent offset() for some nav  items  on document.ready .... I check $('li:first').offset().top < $('li:last').offset().top, and sometimes they're  the same despite rendering on separate lines... an example: http://demo.hopefulpress.com/?theme=theme1
[07:43:23] <Cork> tomasm-: hmm, they shouldn't be
[07:44:07] <tomasm-> i dunno, it's not happening on that site, only on my dev system oddly
[07:44:40] <tomasm-> oh well
[07:46:08] <Cork> tomasm-: http://jsfiddle.net/k3f0rf5x/
[07:47:05] <Cork> tomasm-: though you have to remember that resize is called lazily on mobiles, and will be on desktop in the future too
[07:47:13] <Cork> so you might get jitter there
[07:47:48] <tomasm-> is resize() called on load / doc.ready?
[07:47:54] <Cork> no
[07:50:03] <ionico> hi
[07:50:36] <matthewbe> hi
[07:51:13] <matthewbe> if I put a script tag before the closing body, I can't use: $(document).ready(function() {...} ? This will only work in the <head> tag?
[07:51:58] <tomasm-> I wonder if bootstrap is doing anything  to the navigation....
[07:52:05] <Cork> matthewbe: you can, (it is a bit shaky in some versions of ie though)
[07:52:40] <Cork> matthewbe: .ready fires the function you give it directly if the events it is based on has fired
[07:53:40] <tomasm-> Cork, this is the output I get on my dev  system. http://pastebin.com/csq6bv7d
[07:54:21] <Cork> tomasm-: you might have multiple parents with overflow
[07:54:22] <tomasm-> Cork, I don't understand why the  2nd to last has a low "left" but "top" is the same... and the last one has a "left" that's the same as the 3rd to last
[07:54:31] <Cork> that would explain why the top doesn't change
[07:54:36] <PereP> Cork, tried your suggestion of removing overflow:hidden in my jquery ui dialog but it still keeps growing to accomodate the new height when opening an absolutely-positioned option list... :/
[07:55:19] <Cork> PereP: uh, you talked about wanting to move something outside the dialog, not preventing things from groing
[07:55:39] <tomasm-> Cork,  you mean overflow is set on at least two ancestral objects?
[07:55:41] <Cork> yes, making the dialog overflow: visible makes what would have created a scrollbar instead overflow
[07:55:48] <Cork> that is what the css change mean
[07:56:03] <Cork> tomasm-: no, the dialog-content element
[07:56:16] <PereP> yeah Cork, that's my intention
[07:56:48] <tomasm-> Cork, what's "dialog-content"?
[07:56:50] <PereP> I want to get the contents of the option list outside the dialog when the list is dropped down
[07:58:02] <Cork> opps sorry i mixed up the nicks
[07:58:21] <matthewbe> Cork, not sure I get it. What's the difference if I put my .ready() function in the head VS before closing </body>
[07:58:21] <Cork> tomasm-: just ignore that, its a jquery ui thing :)
[07:58:39] <PereP> this is what I want to accomplish: http://i.stack.imgur.com/lRZJ2.png
[07:58:46] <Cork> matthewbe: if you wrap your code in .ready inside the head you queue a callback that is triggered when the dom is stable
[07:59:14] <Cork> matthewbe: if you have the code wrapped in it at the end of body, it is meant to be a no-op, and the code inside will just run instantly
[07:59:25] <PereP> my example is from StackOverflow and there seems to be an answer to my question but unfortunately the provided fiddles don't work :(
[07:59:31] <Cork> (though i've seen ppl having problems with it there)
[07:59:50] <Cork> PereP: ya, so is mostly wrong about jquery
[08:00:30] <matthewbe> Cork, well thn I can just remove the .ready(). Thus code wrapped inside .ready() in the <head> will have the same effect as code (not wrapped) before </body> ?
[08:00:38] <PereP> :/
[08:00:51] <Cork> matthewbe: the other way around is correct
[08:01:03] <Cork> matthewbe: if you run the code directly inside head you won't have a stable dom
[08:01:07] <tomasm-> Cork, so where do I look to figure out why the  top position is (momentarily) the same?
[08:01:26] <Cork> matthewbe: if you run the code directly at the end of body you will have a stable dom
[08:01:42] <Cork> tomasm-: inspect the document and the elements
[08:01:49] <Cork> the css will always tell
[08:01:55] <notchris> I keep getting “peo is not defined”
[08:01:57] <matthewbe> Cork, but in the docs, it seems that they explain soon about .ready(). But isn't it better to have the JS code before </body> (for different reasons) ?
[08:01:59] <notchris> function peo() { }
[08:02:05] <notchris> Is that how I declare that function?
[08:02:26] <tomasm-> Cork, what am I looking for? something with overflow?
[08:02:40] <Cork> matthewbe: scripts inside head blocks the rendering of the body
[08:02:50] <Cork> matthewbe: so depending on what you need it might not be what you want
[08:03:11] <Cork> notchris: you should figure out why you need the function and where first
[08:03:18] <Cork> tomasm-: for example
[08:03:25] <notchris> I need to load a function onload of a frame
[08:03:35] <notchris> I have to inline it, in this one rare ocassion
[08:03:37] <Cork> but you could also just look at the position information in there
[08:03:59] <matthewbe> Cork, are you saying that as soon as I have ONE SINGLE script in the head, putting scripts before </body> is not useful anymore? Because that ONE script will block the rendering
[08:04:32] <Cork> matthewbe: no, each script you put there has to be fetched, parsed and executed BEFORE the browser starts rendering the body
[08:04:38] <tomasm-> Cork, when I call offset() again, it shows the right  numbers  (li:first.offset.top < li:last.offset.top). its  only momentarily... makes me think bootstrap is doing it
[08:05:07] <Cork> tomasm-: can't answer that, you have to inspect what happens in your own page
[08:07:27] <PereP> ok Cork, I was attaching my option list not directly to the dialog div but to another element inside it which is what was making the whole dialog to grow... now and with overflow: visible is working as expected
[08:07:33] <PereP> so thanks a lot, man :D
[08:08:03] <matthewbe> Cork, so the scripts in the head will be fetched/parsed/executed before the scripts that are before </body> closing tag ?
[08:13:48] <graphettion> Morning all, I'm been trying to get a simple thing working in jQuery, but having trouble. Any pointers? - http://jsfiddle.net/7n8uawqg/
[08:16:50] <Omar-> hi everyone
[08:24:59] <decx> graphettion: instead of doing these tests just have a child span in your breadcrumb and add there
[08:27:00] <graphettion> decx: Thank you! I got it! - http://jsfiddle.net/7n8uawqg/1/
[08:28:34] <decx> that's not very maintainable
[08:28:53] <decx> text has a return function that'll let you access its current text
[08:29:18] <decx> tex(function(index,oldtext){ return oldtext + whatever })
[08:30:09] <graphettion> Interesting.
[08:33:08] <decx> most methods have that
[08:33:20] <decx> css() being one ofthe most useful
[08:35:32] <graphettion> Meh, I'm having trouble getting that working.
[08:47:08] <graphettion> decx: Like this? - http://jsfiddle.net/7n8uawqg/2/
[08:48:11] <decx> not really ^^
[08:50:00] <graphettion> :/
[08:50:06] <decx> follow what your menu says ;)
[08:50:28] <decx> ie http://jsfiddle.net/decx/7n8uawqg/3/
[08:52:59] <graphettion> ooo
[08:53:36] <graphettion> I see now. Thank you!
[08:53:43] <graphettion> Didn't think of that.
[08:54:17] <decx> now you dont have to test anything and it'll work regardless of html being there or software or whatever
[08:54:25] <graphettion> Don't change something that doesn't need to be changed with an empty tag.
[08:54:29] <graphettion> :P
[08:54:40] <decx> there would of course be a way to do it without the extra tag
[08:54:48] <decx> but that wouldnt be a simple
[08:54:50] <decx> as
[08:54:55] <graphettion> gotcha
[08:55:06] <graphettion> I appreciate it!
[08:55:12] <graphettion> Yeah, that's all I need.
[09:03:12] <rubyronin> anyone know how to keep a "div" on top of a page on page change with jquery mobile. Basically I want to keep an audio player streaming while navigatng through pages with jquery mobile
[09:04:46] <zatan> hi how can I pre populate form from querystring? querystring = 'firstname=foo'
[09:16:29] <Changa> How do I skip an onsubmit event listener (which has e.preventDefault for ajax) on press of a designated button to submit the form as it should?
[10:14:00] <DeoSama> I have a order summary page where I add up all the costs of items in a client's order I thought using parseFloat() would be a good idea, however, i'm getting some really strange totals... Anyone have an idea what I should do?
[10:14:36] <decx> never rely on clientside for ecommerce
[10:15:11] <DeoSama> decx, oh, no. haha I'm not. We have prices and stuff stored in our DB and an entirely different process for invoicing that works off that. I just want to display something quick and dirty for the customer to give them an idea
[10:15:34] <robertmaxrees> DeoSama don't add floats via JS.
[10:15:35] <robertmaxrees> ever
[10:15:52] <DeoSama> robertmaxrees, I can tell. What do you suggest?
[10:16:03] <robertmaxrees> if you want to work with floats, multiply everything by 100, do your math, then divide by 100.
[10:16:05] <DeoSama> Let me copy my code to pastebin
[10:16:09] <decx> from those last answers i can deduce that only sith and #jquery deal in absolutes
[10:16:25] <robertmaxrees> DeoSama no need for your code, i just explained it ;)
[10:16:41] <robertmaxrees> get your numbers out of floats, do your math, then put them back in.
[10:16:52] <decx> oh well there you go
[10:17:23] <DeoSama> so, i'm getting my number by this: jQuery('.totalPrice').html(), and was parseFloating that
[10:17:40] <DeoSama> you're saying i should do jQuery('.totalPrice').html() * 100 ?
[10:17:57] <robertmaxrees> parsefloat that to make it a number, then multiply by 100.
[10:18:12] <DeoSama> ok
[10:18:17] <DeoSama> i'll try that real quick
[10:18:18] <decx> or +$('.totalPrice').html() if you want to be neat
[10:18:28] <robertmaxrees> i've never been a fan of that trick personally.
[10:18:35] <decx> it's confusing alright
[10:18:44] <decx> should've written "neat"
[10:19:26] <DeoSama> so i have other totals where i do a totalMonthly += Total
[10:19:28] <DeoSama> i'd want to do a
[10:20:05] <DeoSama> TotalMonthly += (parseFloat('.totalPrice').html()*100) /100 ?
[10:20:10] <DeoSama> that doesn't make sense?
[10:20:13] <robertmaxrees> no.
[10:20:29] <robertmaxrees> TotalMonthly += (parseFloat('.totalPrice').html()*100)
[10:20:46] <robertmaxrees> then when you go to put the number in for display, TotalMonthly / 100
[10:20:47] <DeoSama> where do i divide by 100?
[10:20:51] <DeoSama> oh
[10:20:53] <DeoSama> gotcha
[10:22:45] <DeoSama> alright, sweet! that seems to work
[10:22:54] <DeoSama> with one exception, it doesn't force 2 decimal places
[10:23:01] <DeoSama> do i just do a .toFixed(2) on it?
[10:24:07] <robertmaxrees> that should work.
[10:25:17] <robertmaxrees> just be aware that .toFixed() rounds numbers.
[10:25:31] <DeoSama> hmm
[10:25:38] <DeoSama> ok, thanks so much :)
[10:27:33] <hrusti> how to create and when it make sense to have 'private' methods in jquery plugin? I am writing plugin and I have some methods which are used for plugin logic. They are not meant for users to 'change plugin behaviour'. I check some samples(bootstrap etc.) and they dont use 'private' methods, that's why I am asking.đ
[10:34:59] <decx> put your functions inside the scope that holds your plugin, and what's with the d? is it silent?
[10:35:47] <hrusti> .đ = ? :)
[10:37:01] <nfk|laptop> can anyone explain what i'm doing wrongly?
[10:37:02] <nfk|laptop> s to select form-specific elements according to their type:
[10:37:04] <nfk|laptop>     :password
[10:37:11] <nfk|laptop> erp, sorry, wrong pasta
[10:38:08] <nfk|laptop> idTag = $("#idTag");
[10:38:50] <nfk|laptop> idTag.attr("src", "/filename.ext");
[10:39:13] <nfk|laptop> as far as i can tell, it should set the src to "/filename.ext" but it does not
[10:39:21] <nfk|laptop> and there are no errors either
[10:45:22] <hrusti> nfk|laptop: http://jsfiddle.net/ju6dxje8/
[10:46:14] <hrusti> sry, http://jsfiddle.net/ju6dxje8/1/
[10:47:49] <nfk|laptop> hrusti, why not id?
[10:48:10] <hrusti> nfk|laptop: you can also select by id
[10:49:57] <hrusti> nfk|laptop: http://jsfiddle.net/ju6dxje8/2/
[10:53:39] <nfk|laptop> hrusti, but is there anything i'm doing wrong? it seems i'm doing exactly that but src is undefined
[10:57:36] <hrusti> nfk|laptop: maybe your variable idTag is undefined.
[10:58:09] <nfk|laptop> then doing undefined.attr() is gona explode, no?
[10:58:23] <nfk|laptop> so idTag must have function attr()
[10:58:48] <hrusti> try to console.log(idTag)
[10:59:09] <hrusti> yes you will get error sth. link undefined is not a function i think
[10:59:17] <nfk|laptop> Object { context: HTMLDocument → raspberrypi:8000, selector: "#currentImage" }
[10:59:24] <nfk|laptop> there, actual output
[11:00:11] <nfk|laptop> hrusti, could it be i need to do something like .first()?
[11:00:45] <nfk|laptop> no example does it but that's the only thing i can think of as it looks like it's selector itself not the selected tag
[11:02:09] <samssh> nfk|laptop, attr() is a jquery method, not a DOM API method, so it is correctly called on a jquery object, which is what $(..) returns.
[11:02:30] <nfk|laptop> so it's all correct?
[11:03:12] <nfk|laptop> oh, obviously
[11:03:18] <nfk|laptop> differnt r number
[11:03:19] <nfk|laptop> ....
[11:03:23] <nfk|laptop> *different
[11:03:42] <nfk|laptop> honestly, the time counter indicates i have  spent 2 hours on this
[11:04:36] <nfk|laptop> there, it should work now
[11:08:15] <nfk|laptop> sorry for wasting your time with this stupid typo
[11:09:35] <Athos25> Hi guys, I am trying to make an element draggable and resizable, but somehow the element is only draggable. Inspecting the element shows the proper classes are added. What am I doing wrong?
[12:06:32] <igyiguygyu> How could i do:  if browser = firefox .css() else .css
[12:08:09] <NoiseEee> igyiguygyu: thats a bad question to ask
[12:08:25] <NoiseEee> sniffing for browser is a very old, unreliable type of trick igyiguygyu
[12:08:48] <igyiguygyu> As far as I read it's depreciated but I need to fix this problem i've been having regarding flex box prefixes
[12:08:49] <arthurvr> https://learn.jquery.com/code-organization/feature-browser-detection/
[12:08:54] <Athos25> does anyone have any pointers to check chaining?
[12:09:14] <Athos25> eg. el.resizable().draggable();
[12:09:37] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: oh and jQuery .css() handles prefixes for you (except some edge cases)
[12:10:00] <igyiguygyu> arthurvr: it doesnt handle this one as its display: -webkit-flex
[12:10:11] <arthurvr> igyiguygyu: that way. true
[12:10:55] <igyiguygyu> I can't add .attr(style)
[12:11:05] <igyiguygyu> and can't do .addClass because of the nature of the place i'm putting that
[12:11:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:11:13] <igyiguygyu> it breaks the existing styles
[12:11:17] <robertmaxrees> you could .addClass() just fine.
[12:11:47] <igyiguygyu> Not really. I'm doing that for a tab target container
[12:12:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:12:39] <igyiguygyu> by default it's display:none. I'm targeting first child of ul. If I do .addClass the styles currently on it are overriding. I tried adding !important to class but that breaks the structure the tabs are set up
[12:13:20] <robertmaxrees> that still don't make sense - you should .addClass() to the specific thing that needs it.
[12:16:18] <igyiguygyu> I tried it - it doesn't work. As you click on tab, it adds display:flex to the target container and display:none to the rest of them. If i add class, that display:none is overriding that class
[12:16:34] <igyiguygyu> these tabs are in a modal window
[12:17:22] <igyiguygyu> For some reason the first tab target is not showing up upon the opening of modal so that's why i'm trying to fix this. Right now I'm at the point where it works only on webkit browsers by selecting first child and adding display:-webkit-flex
[12:17:30] <igyiguygyu> but it doesnt work on firefox. Don't really care about IE
[12:18:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm way lost about what the problem is.  good luck.
[12:18:51] <igyiguygyu> Yeah it's a bit complicated :D
[12:19:09] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you need to be adding/removing classes dynamically, instead of just adding them, but i could have that totally wrong.
[12:19:20] <igyiguygyu> that's why i had the initial question how to get jQuery to add class depending on what browser it is
[12:19:38] <igyiguygyu> here - check it yourself the structure
[12:19:39] <igyiguygyu> http://humberzeroshow.com/#modal1
[12:19:58] <igyiguygyu> click on a thumbnail
[12:20:15] <robertmaxrees> i'm kind of in the middle of something and don't have time to go through it :(
[12:20:16] <robertmaxrees> sorry
[12:20:27] <robertmaxrees> somebody else might be able to help though.
[12:26:36] <aias> when i add type="text/javascript" and charset="utf8"  to the <script> tag containing jquery-ui.js, stuff breaks. any ideas?
[12:27:10] <robertmaxrees> remove the charset and see if that fixes it.
[12:39:09] <rhizome> how can i give 'keydown' precedence over 'keyup' without triggering two events, as i get when i do $(document).on('keydown keyup', myHandler)?
[12:39:23] <robertmaxrees> use 'change' or 'input' instead.
[12:39:26] <robertmaxrees> or just bind to one.
[12:39:32] <robertmaxrees> or use keypress.
[12:40:38] <rhizome> i want keyup for touch devices and keydown for responsiveness where keyup doesn't apply. keypress doesn't catch backspace
[12:46:09] <robertmaxrees> out of curiosity, what are you building?
[12:46:27] <robertmaxrees> because you'll have to build in some kind of funky status bit, and that's always kind of painful.
[12:46:51] <rhizome> it's a kind of spelling form that has boxes for each letter
[12:48:32] <rhizome> the two events are probably not a big deal all in all. my bigger question is probably how i can turn off responding to keyup if keydown is satisfied
[12:49:20] <rhizome> oh wait, i use $(this).off('othereventname') elsewhere. i'll give that a try
[12:51:28] <rhizome> hmm, seems not. if i turn it off inside the event.type check, the "else if event.type == 'keyup'" still runs. i'm sure this is bad jq all in all, but here we are.
[13:00:26] <carlgotting> i have code thats retrieved via ajax and put on the screen via $("#output").prepend(data). This data has styles and class atributes that i have jquery registering events to, such as $("a.click").click(...). 2 issues: when the data is laoded the styles in he HTML element attributes arent used (visibility:none;) and the click event doesnt work.
[13:02:15] <robertmaxrees> you need to use event delegation for the click event handling.
[13:02:28] <carlgotting> robertmaxrees: whats that?
[13:02:44] <robertmaxrees> read http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:03:19] <carlgotting> great, it seems to fit.
[13:03:24] <carlgotting> any thoghts on the previous issue?
[13:03:59] <robertmaxrees> "the styles inthe html element attributes" sounds weird.
[13:04:07] <robertmaxrees> could you clarify what you mean?
[13:04:25] <robertmaxrees> fwiw - you should just have classes in your markup and then style according to those in your CVSS.
[13:04:27] <robertmaxrees> *CSS
[13:09:23] <Joel> I'm using jquery mobile in combination with cordova, I'm trying to show log messages to the screen of the device, but I only want to show the last 100 messages, thoughts on the best way to do this? table? div? textarea?
[13:10:25] <rhizome> p?
[13:10:40] <robertmaxrees> UL.  append one <li> for each log message.
[13:11:21] <Joel> robertmaxrees: not a bad idea, I can fade out the top li, then remove it, then show the newly added one.
[13:11:26] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[13:17:55] <forQuery> so... ive used document fragment many times to append all the LI to the UL outside of the loop... but what about a situation where the location of the UL that the LI is being appended to changes and the ul classname is specified inside the .forEach iteration.
[13:18:42] <forQuery> ive narrowed it down as the biggest performance hit in my app... but... im struggling to find solution.
[13:18:59] <robertmaxrees> why are you specifying the class name in the foreach?
[13:19:34] <forQuery> well... it's like... inside the page we have many UL... and inside the UL I am adding this LI template.  But, it is added to the correct UL.
[13:19:35] <robertmaxrees> oh you're asking in ##javascript i'll let them help you there.
[13:19:43] <forQuery> they wont help
[13:19:45] <forQuery> its jquery
[13:19:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:20:06] <forQuery> like, i didnt meant to ask there
[13:20:16] <forQuery> anytime you ask jquery question in javascript room, you get hated on
[13:20:23] <robertmaxrees> not always, but sometimes.
[13:20:25] <forQuery> http://pastiebin.com/55359f9786d23  is paste of example... narrowed it down to 5 lines.
[13:21:14] <robertmaxrees> ah, you have data, and that data tells you which UL to append the LI to?
[13:21:24] <forQuery> yea
[13:22:00] <robertmaxrees> you need to create each UL on the fly instead.
[13:22:07] <robertmaxrees> and then append when you're done with your data.
[13:22:59] <forQuery> thing is... lots of times the UL already have content with LI from previous LI that are added...
[13:23:12] <robertmaxrees> on the page?
[13:23:28] <robertmaxrees> then clone it into a var and work with the cloned version.
[13:23:52] <forQuery> thank you robert, this is a great idea.  Let me give it somet thought and trial.
[13:24:00] <robertmaxrees> that's how you use fragments fwiw.
[13:24:09] <robertmaxrees> not for each LI, but for the entire parent node you're working with.
[13:24:36] <forQuery> can you share, fwiw, i dont know this yet.
[13:24:50] <forQuery> for what it's worth
[13:24:51] <forQuery> :)
[13:24:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:25:20] <forQuery>  maybe if I detached the parent of all the UL... added the LI, then reattached the whole UL.
[13:25:26] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:25:48] <forQuery> but, it's a shame to reattach all if only 1-2 new LI are added and 10-15 exist already.  im going to read more about .clone() have not used yet.
[13:25:50] <robertmaxrees> or each UL.  etc.
[13:35:03] <balloonface> is there a channel that would be good for asking a question about page layout?
[13:51:56] <H3bus> Hi fellows, i'm trying to get a local json file with jquery using $.get("http://localhost/design/projects.json", function (data) {});, but despite my modifications to the json file, i always see the original file, is there some kind of cache or something ?
[13:58:16] <bepolite> H3bus: why not use the data type attribute
[13:59:04] <bepolite> $.ajax({dataType: 'json', url: "http://localhost/design/projects.json", success: function() {} });
[14:08:56] <NoiseEee> can I not adjust the "i" count of the loop at all (i have my reasons) http://jsbin.com/kesozibeko/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[14:16:30] <decx> it's not really i is it NoiseEee
[14:16:41] <decx> just use a for loop
[14:16:52] <NoiseEee> yeah decx thats what I've just discovered, use a for loop
[14:16:56] <NoiseEee> thanks
[14:19:35] <igyiguygyu> Ok i've been trying to solve this one goddamn problem for past hours and couple of hours yesterday and I give up. I'll buy beer to whoever can help me solve this little bitch!
[14:19:48] <igyiguygyu> past 5-6* hours
[14:21:22] <igyiguygyu> I'm sure i'm just not seeing something and there's an error somewhere, even though jslinters show everything is fine. Free beer to whoever can help me solve my problem with displaying tab target
[14:26:40] <igyiguygyu> I've explained the issue before already but I'll do again, I have a modal with tabs inside. The tab target for some reason is not showing up on modal start even though the tab link has class active. I fixed that by adding the .css('display', '-webkit-flex') on .first() element but that doesn't work on firefox. I've tried doing .addClass, i've tried .attr etc. but nothing works.
[14:29:26] <NoiseEee> igyiguygyu: for s'n'giggles, have you tried  .css('display','-webkitFlex') ?
[14:29:27] <bepolite> fiddle igyiguygyu
[14:29:53] <NoiseEee> igyiguygyu: generally css properties with "-" turn into camelCase
[14:30:02] <NoiseEee> ie" border-top-width" = borderTopWidth
[14:30:22] <igyiguygyu> NoiseEee: the problem is that -webkit-flex works just fine, but it doesn't work on firefox as it's a webkit prefix
[14:32:08] <igyiguygyu> bepolite: It's pretty intense to put a fiddle up, I can pm you the link to the site
[14:33:06] <NoiseEee> igyiguygyu: so isn;t it just "flex" in FF?
[14:33:21] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Flexible_boxes @ igyiguygyu ?
[14:33:25] <igyiguygyu> yeah but just flex doesnt work in safari
[14:33:33] <igyiguygyu> safari needs -webkit
[14:33:37] <NoiseEee> you'd have to have both is what im saying
[14:33:55] <decx> i dont know if jquerys auto vendor prefix works for flex
[14:34:04] <NoiseEee> .css{'-webkit-flex':someVal,'flex':someVal})
[14:34:06] <decx> probably not
[14:34:09] <igyiguygyu> Yeah I tried adding 'display' : 'flex', 'display' : '-webkit-flex' but only the second one is registered
[14:34:21] <NoiseEee> igyiguygyu: do it like I did above
[14:34:27] <NoiseEee> igyiguygyu: set more than one property at once
[14:34:42] <NoiseEee> .css({'-webkit-flex':someVal,'flex':someVal})   <--
[14:34:49] <igyiguygyu> by someVal you mean display?
[14:35:54] <NoiseEee> ack sorry, im just blindly typing.  what about  .css('display','-webkitFlex,flex') ?
[14:38:00] <igyiguygyu> NoiseEee:  no doesnt work
[14:38:01] <NoiseEee> igyiguygyu: or just adding a class??
[14:38:14] <NoiseEee> can you not pre-define a class with the rule you want?
[14:38:31] <igyiguygyu> I can't add a class because that is the tab target, and the tab is doing .attr (display:none) to (display:flex) when tabs are switched
[14:38:37] <igyiguygyu> I tried that.
[14:39:01] <NoiseEee> then i think you should change what happens
[14:39:13] <NoiseEee> instead of adjusting the .attr on the fly, it adds/removes the appropriate class
[14:39:31] <NoiseEee> where the class contains two display / cross-browser flex rules
[14:39:48] <NoiseEee> and one class has "display:none"
[14:39:57] <igyiguygyu> The thing is that the tabs plugin adds appropriate prefixes somehow
[14:40:13] <igyiguygyu> the only problem is that when i switch the modals where the tab system is positioned in
[14:40:24] <igyiguygyu> it doesnt show the first tab target by default
[14:40:30] <igyiguygyu> you have to click on first link and then it shows up
[14:41:02] <NoiseEee> well you might wanna fork that plugin to behave as you wish / write your own?  i would say that really adding/removing classes is probably going to be the best route; as you've seen, I *don't* think its possible to write more than one CSS property with JS
[14:42:49] <igyiguygyu> I actually think that I have some mistake somewhere on initializing that plugin
[14:42:58] <igyiguygyu> well it's not really plugin, its a part of a framework
[14:43:30] <NoiseEee> does the framework have a support forum? because then *that* would probably be a good place to inquire.
[14:43:57] <igyiguygyu> They have github chatroom or whatever its called but its dead
[14:44:30] <NoiseEee> ahhh, frameworks :)
[14:44:53] <igyiguygyu> I can send you a link to the site so you have a better understanding of the problem maybe?
[14:45:26] <igyiguygyu> Worst part is that the site is active and people are actively visiting it so this drives me crazy
[14:46:11] <NoiseEee> i'm on my way out... have you peeked at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17896846/set-display-property-flex-on-element-cross-browser  ?  not sure if the answer there applies
[14:46:17] <NoiseEee> but certainly the question seems similar
[14:47:03] <NoiseEee> igyiguygyu: or $(elem).attr('style', 'display: -webkit-flex; display: flex');
[14:47:26] <NoiseEee> which might clobber existing element-level styles, if that matters i dunno
[14:47:32] <igyiguygyu> I can't add attire as it will remove the current .attr what the tabs are putting to control the when target appears and disappears
[14:47:36] <igyiguygyu> attr*
[14:48:03] <NoiseEee> but thats only adjusting the style attr; currently that gets written to already?
[14:48:44] <igyiguygyu> Yeah the tabs are putting up display:none or display:flex
[14:48:54] <igyiguygyu> tab links*
[14:50:47] <oussama> i created a video series, on how to create a tags controller
[14:50:56] <oussama> i need your feedback https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgVap0i35Qc
[14:53:06] <decx> write an article instead
[14:56:59] <igyiguygyu> ggrhhh
[14:57:14] <igyiguygyu> I'm giving away free beer here :D
[15:13:01] <rhizome> my keycodes from the android keyboard are coming in weird, "a" is registering as "å" keycode 229
[15:13:43] <rhizome> works fine in desktop browser
[15:28:22] <rhizome> i thought maybe my locale was weird, but the keyboard is set to English
[15:29:19] <oussama> i need your feedback https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgVap0i35Qc
[15:29:33] <rhizome> for a youtube?
[15:42:24] <forQuery> $(".A, .B")  is this selecting two jquery selectors?  or is it selecting only .A if it is inside .B?
[16:05:17] <Jeroen2> Who is pro? I can't get this working (problem in head of the paste): http://pastebin.com/yA3m6Ahh
[16:15:47] <decx> Jeroen2: you could use animate instead
[16:22:43] <Jeroen2> Thanks decx :)
[17:00:09] <fred1807> I have a bash script that gets whats music playing from MPD, and generate a .html page. I am trying to use jquery to keep the page up to date on browser side. But somethings wrong.. Any help would be great http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=BW2MxMBK
[17:02:14] <robertmaxrees> why not just reload the page?
[17:02:45] <fred1807> it is suposed to keep up to date, change when song changes
[17:02:58] <robertmaxrees> because $('#page').fadeOut('slow').load('nowplaying.html').fadeIn("slow"); relies on you running a webserver.
[17:03:35] <fred1807> can I make it without flickering?
[17:04:26] <fred1807> without meta refresh
[17:05:31] <robertmaxrees> you could add some styles that makes the body transpagerent, then use .fadeIn('slow') on it.  then just fadeOut('slow') before reloadiung the page.
[17:09:31] <fred1807> robertmaxrees:  But I would have to use something like: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="2" > ?
[17:10:25] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[17:10:28] <robertmaxrees> use timeouts.
[17:11:07] <fred1807> for the web server, I could use bash https://github.com/avleen/bashttpd
[17:11:11] <robertmaxrees> wut
[17:11:15] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/reload
[17:11:21] <fred1807> a bash web server: https://github.com/avleen/bashttpd
[17:11:28] <fred1807> btw, this is for a raspberry local machine
[17:11:32] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean you could set up a server.
[17:11:56] <robertmaxrees> if you wanted to do this the right way, you should have an endpoint set up and call that with AJAX and write in your data.
[17:12:18] <fred1807> thats over kill
[17:12:23] <rhizome> use bash to create a json which is read from jquery
[17:12:32] <robertmaxrees> that's actually way easier than what you're doing now.
[17:12:54] <robertmaxrees> just need the base HTML file and the endpoint.
[17:13:01] <fred1807> well , can you help me? : )
[17:13:07] <fred1807> I am no good at it
[17:13:12] <robertmaxrees> the endpoint could literally just be a JSON file you write out with your bash script.
[17:13:29] <robertmaxrees> just need a webserver to be able to do all of it.
[17:13:30] <fred1807> the music name from mpc
[17:13:53] <robertmaxrees> basically, instead of writing out the entire html file, you'd write out a JSON file.
[17:14:44] <rhizome> http://simon-hall.info/2013/05/html5css3jquery-mpd-client/
[17:16:20] <fred1807> okay so this is the "json generator"  need to get into the right terms:  http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=7ACcci7d
[17:16:46] <fred1807> rhizome: I found this link today, but could find the download file
[17:16:46] <robertmaxrees> i don't know bash - what does
[17:16:46] <robertmaxrees> ${artist}
[17:17:00] <fred1807> thats an output
[17:17:14] <fred1807> bash asked mpc (the player) artist name, and song name
[17:17:56] <robertmaxrees> okay, you want something {artist: ${artist}, title: ${title}}
[17:18:03] <robertmaxrees> generate a file using that - what do you get?
[17:18:03] <fred1807> So I need to put  ${artist}  and ${title}  inside a nice json file (I dont know json)
[17:18:35] <fred1807> I will get , Artist Name , and Song Title Name, and owrite that everytime song changes
[17:18:43] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[17:18:46] <robertmaxrees> looka t what i just paste.
[17:18:54] <robertmaxrees> *pasted -  {artist: ${artist}, title: ${title}}
[17:18:56] <robertmaxrees> that's the format.
[17:19:03] <rhizome> fred1807: ah, you're right. seems to be more of a resume page. sorry!
[17:20:12] <rhizome> might need to put explicit quote marks in that output
[17:20:23] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah.
[17:20:33] <robertmaxrees> {artist: "${artist}", title: "${title}"}
[17:22:00] <fred1807> http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=rNryCZBt
[17:23:02] <rhizome> with the quotes added that should work fine
[17:23:10] <robertmaxrees> yep.,
[17:25:14] <fred1807> okay, now I have a .json file, with 1 line:  {artist: Pink Floyd, title: Comfortably Numb}
[17:25:20] <fred1807> {artist: Pink Floyd, title: Comfortably Numb}
[17:25:22] <robertmaxrees> you need quotes around thos evalues.
[17:25:29] <robertmaxrees> {artist: "${artist}", title: "${title}"}
[17:26:20] <fred1807> guess I can remove the {  }   ?
[17:26:33] <robertmaxrees> you need the outer ones.
[17:26:37] <robertmaxrees> for it to bne JSON.
[17:26:48] <rhizome> but yeah, $artist should work fine
[17:26:48] <robertmaxrees> the final output should look like: {artist: "Pink Floyd", title: "Comfortably Numb"}
[17:29:13] <fred1807> play
[17:29:14] <fred1807> {artist: "Pink Floyd", title: "Comfortably Numb"}
[17:29:29] <robertmaxrees> sweet.
[17:29:30] <fred1807> this is my json file, and the script updates it as soons the music changes
[17:29:36] <rhizome> that looks like valid json to me
[17:29:39] <rcyr> That's invalid.
[17:29:46] <rhizome> oh no :(
[17:29:53] <rcyr> In JSON, keys must be in double-quotes
[17:29:53] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah.
[17:29:56] <robertmaxrees> thgat's right.
[17:30:06] <robertmaxrees> {"artist": "Pink Floyd", "title": "Comfortably Numb"}
[17:30:07] <rhizome> gah, i think i've forgotten that before.
[17:30:07] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[17:30:32] <robertmaxrees> once THAT'S fixed, you need to serve up this JSON file (and your html file) using a webserver,.
[17:32:09] <rhizome> my 2nd mistake. nap time.
[17:34:44] <fred1807> okay
[17:34:56] <fred1807> {"artist": "Pink Floyd", "title": "Comfortably Numb"}
[17:35:10] <robertmaxrees> rad.  you got that and the html file served up through your webserver?
[17:35:29] <fred1807> yes
[17:35:32] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[17:36:42] <robertmaxrees> so now your html file needs some JS that looks something like this: http://fixee.org/paste/23kytmo/
[17:39:20] <robertmaxrees> the URL would need to change to point to your actual JSON file, obviously.
[17:39:27] <robertmaxrees> but pop open your consople and see if that works.
[17:40:27] <fred1807> ok, but I need some basic help
[17:40:35] <fred1807> I create a .js file with that paste?
[17:40:43] <fred1807> *have to
[17:40:45] <robertmaxrees> if you want.
[17:40:54] <robertmaxrees> you could include it using script tags instead if you wanted.
[17:41:51] <robertmaxrees> i'd make a js file, populate it with this: http://fixee.org/paste/a7jzyqq/ and include it after your jquery file.
[17:44:25] <fred1807> okay, I made that a file: getnames.js
[17:44:40] <robertmaxrees> so include it right after your jquery include.
[17:45:40] <fred1807> now I need to fix this main guy here: http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=2cBYzzzk
[17:45:59] <robertmaxrees> put jquery back in there.
[17:46:05] <robertmaxrees> include getnames after jquery.
[17:46:08] <robertmaxrees> don't replace it.
[17:46:29] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/edi8gb2/
[17:46:32] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[17:47:51] <fred1807> okay
[17:48:09] <fred1807> but still, there is some code missing on this html, to make the refresh, isnt?
[17:48:18] <robertmaxrees> in the JS< yes.
[17:48:29] <robertmaxrees> the console.log() was to check to make sure the ajax is working correctly.
[17:50:45] <fred1807> somethinwrong
[17:50:53] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:50:58] <robertmaxrees> is the console throwing errors?
[17:52:39] <fred1807> http://cloud.jardimsonoro.com/rompr/nowplaying/nowplaying.json
[17:52:43] <fred1807> here is the json file
[17:52:56] <fred1807> and here the html: http://cloud.jardimsonoro.com/rompr/nowplaying/
[17:53:17] <robertmaxrees> yoiuthat jquery script include is busted.
[17:53:44] <robertmaxrees> you need to make sure your jquery include is good.
[17:53:51] <fred1807> busted?
[17:53:59] <robertmaxrees> <script src="jquery.js"></script>
[17:54:01] <robertmaxrees> that's a 404
[17:54:28] <fred1807> ops
[17:54:33] <fred1807> 1 second
[17:56:45] <fred1807> file was missing from folder, now it is in
[17:56:49] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[17:56:52] <robertmaxrees> that's a super old version.
[17:57:24] <robertmaxrees> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.11.2.min.js - nab this version and replace the contents of what you've got now.
[17:58:55] <fred1807> updated
[17:59:02] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[17:59:19] <robertmaxrees> now update getnames.js with this: fixee.org/paste/7mzkdo1/#url=zo5u5ff
[18:00:15] <robertmaxrees> oh exceptthat json url is bad.
[18:01:15] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/7mzkdo1/#url=psbt4zs
[18:01:17] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[18:03:32] <fred1807> online..
[18:03:56] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:05:50] <fred1807> wow
[18:06:01] <robertmaxrees> that tries to update every 5 seconds.
[18:06:36] <fred1807> Amazing! Thank you!
[18:07:14] <fred1807> Guess I should upload that to GitHub
[18:07:25] <fred1807> how can I link you name? (twitter / github user)
[18:07:32] <robertmaxrees> hah, no need.
[18:07:36] <robertmaxrees> it's nothing perfect.
[18:10:55] <fred1807> I want to try to go further and use $artist name to fetch artist image from last.fm api, and then use it as a full backround , maybe with some blur or shade effect
[18:11:39] <fred1807> its gonna look rad
[18:11:59] <robertmaxrees> i'd check to make sure they allow CORS.
[18:13:23] <fred1807> from the last.fm blog  : Hey guys, Today we added CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) support to our web services. This basically means that you can now make cross-domain requests to the API purely from within the browser.  :D
[18:24:22] <asdf_> is jquery just line one js file?
[18:24:24] <asdf_> im new to it
[18:24:34] <asdf_> just linke*
[18:24:37] <asdf_> like*
[18:25:12] <asdf_> i mean if i download a website thats using jquery and if i just copy and paste jquery to my project
[18:25:20] <asdf_> is that the same thing as downloading jquery
[18:25:28] <asdf_> from the official website
[18:27:17] <Robdgreat> asdf_: yes, the core of jquery is just one file
[18:27:45] <asdf_> thanks rob
[18:28:04] <asdf_> by non core you mean plugins?
[19:15:35] <rhizome> i have a page that loads with a text input with focus, and if i tap a link on the page the screen keyboard pops up. how can i prevent this, or figure out what event to turn off?
[19:59:25] <Robdgreat> asdf_: yeah, I meant as opposed to plugins
[20:00:35] <asdf_> how did you read what i typed through all the "join, quit" alerts?
[20:00:39] <asdf_> is there a way to disable?
[20:01:06] <asdf_> not show those?
[20:09:33] <printForever> anyone up?
[20:10:28] <printForever> I'm looking a tabs script, that can switch after a callback when radio button is selected
[20:11:08] <rgenito> heya guys
[20:12:49] <rgenito> anyone have an idea why my jsfiddle doesn't have 2 dropdown menus?
[20:12:50] <rgenito> https://jsfiddle.net/u93egjv2/1/
[20:13:17] <rgenito> the 2nd one should be visible due to my data-bind="visible:" condition, right?
[20:14:25] <rgenito> updated -.-
[20:14:25] <rgenito> http://jsfiddle.net/u93egjv2/2/
[20:15:14] <guzzlefry> Howdy
[20:15:29] <fred1807> I have a page with 3 color: A backround color, a color for text box 1 and color for text box 2.  Can I make that o mouse click, anywhere, those 3 colors random change (but based on a definited pallete) ?
[20:15:29] <guzzlefry> I can't seem to redirect using window.location.href = '/' inside my ajax .done callback.
[20:15:31] <guzzlefry> Any ideas?
[20:15:58] <rgenito> =|
[20:16:12] <rgenito> guzzlefry, any errors in your console? ;x
[20:16:34] <guzzlefry> nope
[20:18:35] <rgenito> guzzlefry, did you try js linting it?
[20:18:41] <rgenito> or try putting it on jsfiddle.net ?
[20:18:47] <guzzlefry> I ran through the debugger.
[20:18:54] <guzzlefry> It's hitting the assignment statement.
[20:19:47] <rgenito> i believe location.href needs to be an absolute URL
[20:19:47] <rgenito> right?
[20:19:53] <rgenito> oh wait nm
[20:19:56] <guzzlefry> nope, '/' works fine
[20:21:31] <guzzlefry> So weird.
[20:21:40] <guzzlefry> It doesn't seem to be a scope issue either.
[20:23:20] <rgenito> did you litter your code with a bunch of console.log's?
[20:23:35] <guzzlefry> no
[21:12:12] <rubyronin> (crossing fingers) does anyone have any experience with the slick.js carousel?
[21:12:24] <rubyronin> no idea why this isn't parsing into the carousel http://codepen.io/anon/pen/vOYKyM
[21:34:43] <weebo> any good alternatives to nesting two slide menus?
[21:44:14] <VectorX> hi i got this code which adds the class to the element, but it doesnt work sometimes, is there a better way to do this ? $('.odd td:nth-child(5)').addClass('color1');
[21:44:21] <VectorX> doesnt work as in the class does not get added
[21:45:48] <hackergeek> Would not be able to tell you until I see the reset of the code?
[21:47:12] <VectorX> just wondering if it is a known issue and when it would happend
[21:47:52] <VectorX> someway perhaps i can ensure any $('.odd td:nth-child(5)') gets that class
[21:49:14] <hackergeek> I don't think it's a known issue.  It has never happened to me before unless other code conflicts with it or something.  Did you call that script before you import jQuery or after?
[21:50:38] <VectorX> unfortunately im fixing someone elses code and its a mess
[21:51:34] <Uhkis> does $('.odd td').eq(4) work?
[21:51:46] <hackergeek> My first step would be to run it on a browser and right click and click Inspect Element.  Go into Console and see if it gives you any errors.
[21:52:48] <printForever> looking for some help with switching to next tab when clicking on radio button
[21:52:49] <printForever> http://jsfiddle.net/9wzbod7L/
[21:53:53] <printForever> here is a small update http://jsfiddle.net/9wzbod7L/1/
[22:03:32] <matthewbe> hi
[22:04:27] <duckgoose> hello
[22:10:02] <tehJ> sup
[22:33:41] <lxsameer> guys, I use .ajax, and the response status code is 200, but jquery runs my fail callback
[22:33:47] <lxsameer> why?
[22:34:28] <Uhkis> ?paste @ lxsameer
[22:34:28] <b-ot> lxsameer: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:39:15] <VectorX> hackergeek Uhkis created an exmple fiddle of the issue i am having http://jsfiddle.net/go3yfnwp/2/ when it starts the last coloum is colored, then pagination 2 works but after 3 there is no color, in the code i am working on if you press the button twice then it adds the color to it, but this is taking it a step futher
[22:42:21] <Cork> lxsameer: check the content of the third argument to your error/fail function
[22:42:39] <lxsameer> thanks
[22:42:40] <Cork> lxsameer: it is most likely a parser error
[22:42:53] <lxsameer> Cork: thanks man
[22:43:52] <VectorX> actually in this example code the first two clicks seem to work where which ever numbers you click then next pagination clicks dont seem to color the text
[22:50:41] <VectorX> guys are you there ?
[22:54:18] <bepolite> whats up VectorX
[22:54:45] <VectorX> exmple fiddle of the issue i am having http://jsfiddle.net/go3yfnwp/2/ when it starts the last coloum is colored, then pagination 2 works but after 3 there is no color, in the code i am working on if you press the button twice then it adds the color to it, but this is taking it a step futher and just not working
[22:55:14] <VectorX> the salary column color should be red or green, and clicking the pagination buttons should update the colors
[23:03:51] <bepolite> I'm having a hard time opening jsfiddle VectorX  It seems it has been blocked by my ISp
[23:05:25] <VectorX> wow thats nuts
[23:07:23] <VectorX> the click event sems to be firing but im not getting why the addclass isnt adding the class to the element
[23:45:20] <Chulbul_> Is there any js plugin that can be used to crop images just like what is used in twitter.com or facebook.com
[23:50:52] <Stiffler> good morning
[23:51:02] <Stiffler> I would like to store email address in data attribute
[23:51:11] <Stiffler> any ideas how?
[23:52:32] <Stiffler> coz when I try to select div i got: Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: div[data-user=stiffler.to@gmail.com]
[23:53:40] <duckgoose> try div[data-user='stiffler.to@gmail.com']
[23:54:53] <Stiffler> duckgoose: but it doesnt work
[23:55:04] <Stiffler> Ive read that chrome only recon it only without ''
[23:58:15] <duckgoose> Stiffler the jQuery selector should be in the format attribute_name='attribute_value' across all browsers
[23:58:58] <duckgoose> Stiffler try this $("div[data-user='stiffler.to@gmail.com']")
[23:59:44] <Cork> ya, you should never use attribute value selectors without quotes (single or double)
