[00:03:57] <GeekMonkey> no
[00:04:13] <GeekMonkey> but I still need the structure
[00:05:41] <GeekMonkey> thanks gf3
[00:06:47] <gf3> well you could `.remove()` it from the DOM if you no longer need it
[00:06:53] <gf3> oh bye
[07:08:03] <Bheam> ugh
[07:08:13] <Bheam> how long is .append() with 1mb pure html supposed to take?
[07:08:27] <Bheam> it's taking 20 seconds
[07:08:35] <Bheam> doesn't seem right to me :(
[07:11:31] <Cork> Bheam: i wouldn't thing that is a correctly closed string
[07:11:55] <Cork> Bheam: also if you want to know you could do $.parseHTML(the value)
[07:12:00] <Cork> and then you get a dom structure
[07:12:09] <Cork> would tell you the parse time
[07:14:36] <Bheam> parseHTML only takes 0.5 sec
[07:15:29] <Bheam> could it be css that takes so much time?
[07:33:23] <Bheam> ended up adding one by one child element with a setTimeout(..., 0) in between
[07:33:31] <Bheam> atleast browser doesn't freeze
[09:10:53] <Duikb00t> hi
[09:19:10] <Duikb00t> How was this again I want to validate firs tbefore I submit my form
[09:19:12] <Duikb00t>     $( "#form-registration" ).submit(function( event ) {
[09:19:14] <Duikb00t>         event.preventDefault();
[09:19:21] <Duikb00t> How do I fainally do the real submit (For the POST) submit
[09:25:49] <Cork> Duikb00t: don't call prevent before you
[09:25:54] <Cork> before the validation failed
[09:26:05] <Cork> if the validation is async you will have to though
[09:26:18] <Cork> and then you just call the .submit() directly on the dom element
[09:26:31] <Cork> but the first structure is preferable if you can though
[09:27:05] <Cork> (as the second breaks some browser features)
[09:27:19] <Duikb00t> OK
[09:27:21] <Duikb00t> good
[09:27:23] <Duikb00t> thanks
[09:27:57] <Cork> np
[09:33:53] <Duikb00t> I have to find out a good way to loop fields like [children][0][firstname]
[09:34:00] <Duikb00t> [children][0][lastname]
[09:34:10] <Duikb00t> but then with more indexes ( it's from a repeated field
