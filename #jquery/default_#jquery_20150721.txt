[00:04:07] <hellyeah> hey i know it is very simple but why it didnt work http://jsfiddle.net/5sdbfydg/
[00:06:02] <hellyeah> damn
[00:06:16] <hellyeah> forgot #
[00:06:17] <hellyeah> :D
[00:13:55] <hellyeah> hey can you check the console why it gave me blue, red, orange, gray and grb code for green?
[00:14:12] <hellyeah> i supposed all of it must be rgb code?
[00:15:59] <hellyeah> ops
[00:16:06] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/5sdbfydg/5/
[00:17:44] <Uhkis> hellyeah: jquery helps http://jsfiddle.net/5sdbfydg/6/
[00:18:15] <hellyeah> lemme check
[00:19:09] <hellyeah> thank you
[00:19:25] <hellyeah> i plan to check the color and change it with nice color
[00:19:32] <hellyeah> colors are saturated
[00:28:32] <hellyeah> hey can i use addClass like that?
[00:28:35] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/5sdbfydg/8/
[00:28:48] <hellyeah> hmm
[00:28:53] <hellyeah> it is not working with index
[00:32:20] <Uhkis> because you removed $()
[00:38:02] <Xv12tre758> Hi everybody Nice to meet you.
[00:40:03] <hellyeah> Uhkis:  that worked http://jsfiddle.net/5sdbfydg/10/
[00:40:12] <hellyeah> thanks for heads up
[00:40:16] <hellyeah> Xv12tre758:  hey
[01:01:48] <Alfas> Hi . I want to show a html file from other html file using .load() . But it is not working
[01:02:25] <Alfas> can anyone tell me that?
[01:05:06] <Alfas> what is going on here?
[01:05:57] <Xatenev> Alfas: how should we know
[01:06:16] <Xatenev> .load works to load HTML files.
[01:16:17] <Cork> most likely tried to fetch from a third party server
[01:20:04] <Xatenev> Cork: ur too late, he already went away :(^^
[01:20:10] <Cork> i know
[01:22:12] <Uhkis> hmm, can .css() be used to unset some declarations?
[01:22:30] <Cork> sure
[01:22:36] <Cork> .css('prop', '')
[01:22:52] <Cork> or .css({ prop: '' })
[01:40:07] <Uhkis> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/wb0z4mth/ not sure if intended but doesn't seem to work with dimensions at least
[01:40:38] <Cork> Uhkis: it won't reset the stylesheet
[01:40:45] <Cork> it will remove inline values
[01:40:49] <hellyeah> hey
[01:41:02] <hellyeah> jquery has a function to find rbg value?
[01:41:14] <Cork> Uhkis: if you want to remove the css values, give it a class and remove it when you don't want the values
[01:41:25] <hellyeah> rgb value of this #D95433;
[01:41:26] <Cork> hellyeah: no
[01:41:46] <Cork> but it should be simple enough
[01:41:57] <Cork> just split it on two characters and hex convert it to int
[01:44:27] <Cork> js> print('#D95433'.replace(/#(..)(..)(..)/, function(s,r,g,b) { return parseInt(r, 16).toString() + ',' + parseInt(g, 16).toString() + ','+ parseInt(b, 16).toString(); }).split(','))
[01:44:29] <Uhkis> this is so wrong, i had to override css override of img height/width with js ;D
[01:44:29] <b-ot> Cork: 217,84,51
[01:44:50] <Cork> Uhkis: uh... why?
[01:44:54] <Cork> just fix the css
[01:45:25] <Cork> hmm actually that one could be simplified
[01:46:06] <Cork> js> print('#D95433'.replace(/#(..)(..)(..)/, function(s,r,g,b) { return [parseInt(r, 16), parseInt(g, 16), parseInt(b, 16)]; }).split(','))
[01:46:09] <b-ot> Cork: 217,84,51
[01:48:29] <Uhkis> the base theme css has styles for img and it messes up images with dimension attributes for some reason (both are auto in the css)
[01:48:51] <Cork> Uhkis: so set it to : auto
[01:48:58] <Uhkis> and it has something to do with something (:D) and i really cba to check every damn image on the site if i mess up with it
[01:49:14] <Uhkis> Cork: that's the weird part, the css is already auto
[01:49:28] <Cork> no it isn't
[01:49:42] <Uhkis> then firebug is a dirty liar!
[01:49:44] <Cork> inspect it with the browser inspector
[01:49:56] <Cork> could you reproduce the problem in a fiddle?
[01:50:50] <Uhkis> ff inspector also agrees on the auto
[01:50:54] <Cork> https://placehold.it/ <-- if you need images
[01:51:29] <Uhkis> ill try!
[01:53:31] <Uhkis> well that was easy
[01:53:39] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/7pere8h1/
[01:54:08] <Uhkis> i'm guessing that's intended then
[01:54:46] <Cork> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/7pere8h1/1/
[01:55:03] <Cork> ya, css wins over html attributes
[01:55:19] <Cork> uh.. except i can't spell...
[01:56:09] <donm2> Hi I'm looking for a plugin or an effect where I want to display a div when the user clicks on a button, But I want the div animation to start from where the user has clicked(say a button) - ideally to have it animated like mac osx taskbar  where it looks like it is coming from the task bar. Does anyone know of something like that ?
[01:56:10] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/7pere8h1/2/ i went this way
[01:56:33] <Uhkis> with better selector :D
[01:56:35] <Cork> Uhkis: that's really horribly though...
[01:57:41] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/7pere8h1/3/ the actual code
[01:57:46] <Uhkis> improvements are welcome!
[01:59:41] <Cork> Uhkis: that said, why not just do <img style="width:"> instead of width=""?
[02:00:46] <Uhkis> now that's a question for the ckeditor developers
[02:00:53] <Cork> ah
[02:01:03] <Cork> so that's where the problem comes from
[02:01:14] <Cork> Uhkis: i think they have a setting for that if i remember correctly
[02:01:18] <Cork> haven't used it in years though
[02:02:59] <Uhkis> hmm, there's separate "style" section on advanced tab, maybe that's why it uses those attributes instead of style
[02:03:31] <Cork> using the width/height attribute is recommended
[02:03:41] <Uhkis> i'm 99% someone doesn't wanna teach the customers to use that instead of that easy way :D
[02:03:50] <Cork> but in you're case the css breaks things so you want the css values if possible
[02:05:15] <Cork> Uhkis: but, ya fiddling with this reminded me that attributes doesn't have anything to do with css :)
[02:05:19] <Cork> had forgotten that
[02:06:02] <Uhkis> yup
[02:08:51] <Jewlly> Hey guys, I have a small issue
[02:09:17] <Jewlly> We have a track code in JS, but the developers of this code used document.write to attach tracking pixels
[02:09:27] <Jewlly> So I cannot load it using $.getScript(...)
[02:09:36] <Cork> lovely
[02:09:49] <Jewlly> They suggested me to create an iframe, and add the track JS url into the src.
[02:09:59] <Jewlly> So I did this: http://pastebin.com/yp8gyHDm
[02:10:13] <Jewlly> However, the Chrome says: Resource interpreted as Document but transferred with MIME type application/javascript
[02:10:27] <Jewlly> Anyone knows what could be a solution for this case?
[02:19:59] <Nasp> Because an iframe is supposed to be html and not js
[02:22:04] <fitzilla> Does anyone know  what I might be looking for? A 'hamburger' style menu, which slides into a div based on % width and isn't 'off-canvas' ?
[02:25:58] <Uhkis> accordion..?
[02:26:47] <fitzilla> Hm, Uhkis, yeah!
[02:26:55] <fitzilla> I guess a horizontal accordion, if that's possible.
[02:27:27] <Uhkis> jquery ui has accordion
[02:27:40] <fitzilla> yeah.
[02:27:50] <fitzilla> thanks, didn't consider that.
[02:44:14] <c0d3n4m3> Hello all, how does one say "If this select input was changed, run this code, else run this code"
[03:34:19] <PCatinean> What is the easiest and most cross-browser compatible way to determine if a number is in a array in jquery?
[03:34:57] <arthurvr> !api jQuery.inArray
[03:34:57] <b-ot> arthurvr: jQuery.inArray(): Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[03:35:08] <PCatinean> thank you arthurvr
[03:35:30] <prohobo> convert the array to a string!
[03:35:35] <prohobo> split on commas!
[03:35:48] <prohobo> do indexOf(num.toString())!
[03:35:58] <PCatinean> hmm so which one is best
[03:35:59] <prohobo> > 1337
[03:36:13] <PCatinean> g4x0r3
[03:36:14] <arthurvr> PCatinean: just use inArray it’s built therefore :p
[03:36:16] <PCatinean> h4x0r3*
[03:36:17] <prohobo> what arthurvr said
[03:36:34] * PCatinean realises he has just been trolled
[03:36:36] <PCatinean> XD
[03:36:57] <prohobo> hey, i have some horrific code
[03:37:08] <prohobo> someday you might need to do what i said
[03:40:02] <PCatinean> and to determine if a element is selected (in case of select) and checked in case of radio buttons and checkboxes?
[03:46:33] <arthurvr> PCatinean: really easy in most cases. Quick and easy example: http://jsbin.com/quxasusaye/edit?html,js,output
[03:48:22] <Uhkis> that red really hurt my eyes, next time include a warning arthurvr! :D
[03:48:52] <arthurvr> Uhkis: :p
[03:51:14] <prohobo> wtf
[03:51:18] <prohobo> "this.checked" works?
[03:51:21] <prohobo> -_-
[03:51:40] <prohobo> also, christmas-y
[03:52:14] <Cork> prohobo: this is just a dom element
[03:52:18] <Cork> so ya, it works fine
[03:52:41] <rollingWolf> Iirc if you stare at red too much green will look "greener" . .Apparently a trick disney uses in their themeparks to make the grass look greener
[03:52:44] <tumulte> what's the best way to get all siblings including self ?
[03:53:35] <Cork> $(this).siblings().addBack()
[03:54:00] <Cork> or $(this).parent().children()
[03:54:14] <tumulte> Cork: I've always found the later ugly
[03:54:26] <JQMW8> hi guys ı need help about date in windows phone 8
[03:54:34] <PCatinean> A function that works for both select input and radio?
[03:54:38] <JQMW8> have u ever solved this problem before?
[03:54:41] <Cork> tumulte: well it is what the former does anyway
[03:54:48] <Cork> just hidden away
[03:54:58] <JQMW8> not like native datepicker in nokia as in adnroid or ios
[03:55:11] <tumulte> Cork: thanks I didn't know addback
[03:55:52] <Cork> tumulte: note though $(this).siblings() does $(this).parent().children().not(this)
[03:56:00] <rollingWolf> JQMW8 What is the question?
[03:56:11] <Cork> and then you add this back again through addBack()
[03:56:28] <JQMW8> type=date is running on android and ios like native date picker
[03:56:40] <JQMW8> but not seem native datepicker in winphone8
[03:56:51] <JQMW8> my problem is its
[03:57:21] <Cork> JQMW8: you would have to use a js implementation for ie
[03:57:34] <Cork> they don't support <input type="date"> except in there nightly builds
[03:57:37] <tumulte> Cork: really ? I'm pretty unaware of the mechanics behing jquery !
[03:57:56] <Uhkis> ?api addback
[03:57:56] <b-ot> Uhkis: No matches.
[03:58:06] <Cork> tumulte: it doesn't have much choice it is how the dom works
[03:58:33] <Cork> tumulte: you could do $(this.parentNode.children) if you prefer :)
[03:58:45] <Uhkis> ?api addBack
[03:58:45] <b-ot> Uhkis: No matches.
[03:58:51] <Uhkis> b-ot: you suck!
[03:59:04] <arthurvr> don’t hurt b-ot’s feelings Uhkis
[03:59:20] <JQMW8> are there any preference about this issue?
[03:59:24] <Uhkis> arthurvr: but it's being so rude!
[03:59:24] <Cork> ya, but it is the truth
[03:59:42] <Cork> JQMW8: preferences?
[03:59:50] <Uhkis> ?g jquery addback
[03:59:50] <b-ot> Uhkis: .addBack() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/addback/
[03:59:57] <Uhkis> it's right there!
[03:59:58] <JQMW8> about  date type seem native in windows phone
[04:00:03] <JQMW8> like android and ios
[04:00:13] <Cork> JQMW8: it isn't implemented, and that is why you don't get it
[04:00:25] <PCatinean> Basically I can have either a select with multiple options or a range of checkboxes/radio buttons and when a value is changed I use ajax to send the all the checked values to the server which returns a list of available values back
[04:00:27] <Cork> like i said, it is implemented in the nightly builds of ie
[04:00:38] <JQMW8> ımplemented in .cs file however not effected it
[04:00:42] <Cork> if you need support older versions you have to provide a js fallback
[04:00:54] <PCatinean> So all the non-available values get deselected and have the .hidden class added to it and the others removed (the .hidden class)
[04:01:01] <PCatinean> Hope that's a good design
[04:01:53] <silverdust> Hi Cork this is not too JQuery, just logic in JS. I have this fiddle where I'm trying to get difference in days between a fed date in a function and Time.now http://jsfiddle.net/ptszbeb5/
[04:02:08] <Cork> O_o
[04:02:24] <Cork> why are you directing this at me? ^^'
[04:02:32] <silverdust> I think I'm close but then I think I've lost myself. Handling this the way I handled it in rails
[04:02:46] <Uhkis> Cork: like this is the first time someone does that ;)
[04:02:49] <silverdust> You seemed the most active now :/
[04:03:12] <Cork> silverdust: you want to use the date object, not the getTime number
[04:03:27] <silverdust> Actually, I usually don't. I've been here for too long to know no one really likes
[04:03:50] <silverdust> on both today and created?
[04:05:25] <silverdust> oh that failed still
[04:08:17] <silverdust> It gave me a higher negative number
[04:14:56] <silverdust> Cork ?
[04:16:40] <silverdust> Can anyone please help me figure out how I can achieve a hourly time difference with this function http://jsfiddle.net/ptszbeb5/
[04:18:21] <taplar> what do you mean hourly time difference?
[04:18:58] <Cork> silverdust: http://jsfiddle.net/ptszbeb5/1/
[04:19:40] <Cork> the date object is quite nice when it comes to calculate these things
[04:19:43] <Cork> so just use it
[04:20:11] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/ptszbeb5/2/ a lot simpler imo :D
[04:20:39] <silverdust> Thanks
[04:21:36] <silverdust> Uhkis: I don't see what you changed
[04:21:50] <Uhkis> silverdust: from milliseconds to seconds
[04:21:50] <silverdust> oh the 24
[04:22:10] <decx> what's the 3 do?
[04:22:29] <silverdust> I'm not making sense ughh
[04:22:43] <silverdust> decx: The 3 is the number of days from creation
[04:23:15] <silverdust> The time limit I mean
[04:23:49] <Cork> ah, days
[04:23:54] <silverdust> So if difference between present time and created exceeds 3 I'll send expired
[04:23:59] <Cork> then it's in the wrong place
[04:24:53] <decx> do you even need getTime
[04:25:14] <decx> date1-date2 will spit out milliseconds regardless of it
[04:25:29] <silverdust> date1 is just a string
[04:25:40] <decx> well you new Date it
[04:25:42] <silverdust> so I'll be doing 'This string' - Time.now ?
[04:25:48] <decx> new... Date rocks... new Date rocks
[04:25:50] <Uhkis> silverdust: http://jsfiddle.net/ptszbeb5/3/ this was the output you actually wanted?
[04:25:55] <silverdust> sorry I meant new Date()
[04:27:15] <silverdust> Yes. Thanks y'all. Yep I find date amazing. I leave moment to do heavy lifting most times
[04:27:38] <slax0r> hi, can I do in jQuery var foo = "bar"; $.foo() and it will call $.bar() ?
[04:27:40] <silverdust> I just thought this was too small for that
[04:28:52] <prohobo> slax0r: nope
[04:28:58] <prohobo> foo is a string in your example
[04:29:09] <slax0r> I know it's a string
[04:29:19] <prohobo> if you mean that you want to call functions by string identifiers
[04:29:20] <slax0r> and I want to call the function in that vars value
[04:29:22] <prohobo> then i dont know
[04:29:40] <slax0r> just like I do in PHP, $foo = "bar"; $foo(); calls bar();
[04:30:25] <prohobo> well
[04:30:35] <prohobo> you can use object syntax
[04:30:41] <slax0r> window["$"][foo](args) could work
[04:30:56] <prohobo> yeah
[04:31:01] <prohobo> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/359788/how-to-execute-a-javascript-function-when-i-have-its-name-as-a-string
[04:31:41] <piXonix> slax0r: just catching up on I think what you are after
[04:31:44] <piXonix> try this: http://www.sitepoint.com/call-javascript-function-string-without-using-eval/
[04:31:46] <Cork> just do $[foo]
[04:31:50] <Cork> no need for window
[04:32:01] <piXonix> that might hve some info in it for you
[04:33:01] <Cork> js> $ = { bar: function() { return 'hello'; } }; var foo = 'bar'; print($[foo]())
[04:33:05] <b-ot> Cork: hello
[04:35:04] <taplar> for silverdust 's thing was he just after a comparator?  would it be a little more readable to write it that way? http://jsfiddle.net/ptszbeb5/5/
[04:36:22] <Cork> heh good point
[04:45:52] <slax0r> Cork: yeah, did, thanks!
[04:56:48] <BostonGeorge2k> hi, i am trying to hook to an event but it's not working http://pastebin.com/p0UqCDha
[04:57:13] <BostonGeorge2k> i am not sure if .section-background is correct though b/c i am not sure how to figure out which element "fires" it
[04:57:35] <taplar> console log your selector and make sure the length is > 0
[04:57:52] <BostonGeorge2k> how do i log the selector
[04:58:02] <taplar> console.log($(selector));
[04:58:48] <Cork> or console.log($('.section-background').length)
[04:59:27] <BostonGeorge2k> i see and how do i figure out if a selector is attached to an event?
[04:59:49] <decx> better code management
[04:59:51] <taplar> reverse, events are attached to elements
[05:00:07] <taplar> but ^
[05:01:09] <BostonGeorge2k> http://pastebin.com/wyRzAZzz
[05:01:16] <BostonGeorge2k> which means that .section-background-slideshow is the selector
[05:01:58] <taplar> sure
[05:02:13] <taplar> so your missing the -backgrond on your other selector maybe?
[05:02:29] <taplar> err -slideshow
[05:02:33] <BostonGeorge2k> i originally tried both but now i am sure which one it is
[05:02:42] <BostonGeorge2k> i guess the function is still wrong
[05:02:53] <BostonGeorge2k> uhh, the event
[05:03:23] <mdev> use on when possible
[05:03:39] <BostonGeorge2k> $('.section-background-slideshow').on('slideTo', function(e) {
[05:04:02] <BostonGeorge2k> i thought slideTo gets fired but i find it very hard to debug
[05:04:23] <mdev> $(document.body).on('keydown', '.test', function(event) {
[05:04:29] <taplar> according to their site there is a before and after callback
[05:04:47] <taplar> http://responsiveslides.com/ section #5
[05:06:30] <BostonGeorge2k> hm, yes
[05:07:49] <BostonGeorge2k> but i still need the event right
[05:07:56] <taplar> why?
[05:08:18] <BostonGeorge2k> i guess i cant just do on('before') because that could be anything
[05:08:57] <taplar> i would assume before is called before the animation starts a slide effect, and after once an effect is finished, reoccuring for each slide animation
[05:11:32] <BostonGeorge2k> yes of coruse
[05:11:38] <BostonGeorge2k> but how to attach to it
[05:11:51] <taplar> in your initialization
[05:12:11] <taplar> give it whatever callback you want it to use
[05:12:48] <BostonGeorge2k> i dont get it
[05:12:54] <taplar> hold on
[05:13:37] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/05de8Lqg/
[05:15:19] <BostonGeorge2k> ohh yes that's it
[05:15:21] <BostonGeorge2k> thanks!

[05:34:54] <crippa> this is what I use from cURL and it works
[05:35:15] <Cork> ya, but curl don't has cors protection (it doesn't need it)
[05:35:54] <crippa> cors?
[05:35:55] <Cork> so for example if http://localhost/something.html tries to access http://localhost:8080/GCGI/myapp/pets
[05:35:59] <Cork> the browser will block it
[05:36:23] <prohobo> that url doesnt even work
[05:36:29] <prohobo> how can we help you if your link doesnt work
[05:36:31] <crippa> why should the browser block it?
[05:36:41] <Cork> prohobo: ... its localhost, what do you expect
[05:36:46] <prohobo> :P
[05:36:52] <Cork> crippa: cause it is cors == cross origin request
[05:37:22] <Cork> http://localhost:8080/something.html would work
[05:37:27] <Cork> but not http://localhost/
[05:37:34] <Cork> or https://localhost:8080/
[05:37:37] <PCatinean> with jquery.inArray I have to do == -1?
[05:37:46] <Cork> PCatinean: yes
[05:37:51] <crippa> url: "http://localhost:8080/GCGI/myapp/pets", -> that's what I'm using in my js script
[05:38:04] <Cork> crippa: that is the target yes
[05:38:08] <Cork> but what is the source of the request?
[05:38:19] <crippa> my browser?
[05:38:22] <Cork> THAT is what matters
[05:38:23] <Cork> no
[05:38:31] <Cork> you are doing it from a page you have loaded
[05:38:33] <crippa> what is then?
[05:38:37] <PCatinean> then the other results are 0?
[05:38:37] <Cork> you are doing it from a page you have loaded <--
[05:38:42] <PCatinean> why can't it return true/false?
[05:38:47] <taplar> PCatinean: it returns the index of the found element
[05:38:53] <taplar> PCatinean: -1 if not found
[05:39:01] <Cork> 0 is the first index
[05:39:03] <Cork> and then up
[05:39:10] <PCatinean> ahhh got it, thank you very much
[05:39:14] <crippa> Cork: I'm not following..
[05:39:17] <PCatinean> so for true >= 0 right?
[05:39:22] <taplar> yep
[05:39:25] <taplar> or > -1
[05:39:37] <Cork> crippa: if domain1.com tries to access something on domain2.com the browser won't allow it
[05:39:49] <Cork> it is called cross domain requests and is a security problem
[05:40:06] <Cork> crippa: so what page you are trying to do this from matters
[05:40:14] <Cork> _FROM_
[05:51:35] <PCatinean> sorry if I asked before and didn't pay attention but is there a way to determine is a element (either input or select) is selected/checked
[05:51:42] <PCatinean> without checking the element type before
[05:53:57] <taplar> is(':checked')
[05:54:08] <PCatinean> for both select and input radio/checkbox taplar ?
[05:54:21] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[05:54:35] <PCatinean> uuu sexy! great
[05:54:40] <PCatinean> and to uncheck/unselect?
[05:54:53] <taplar> maybe :not(:checked)
[05:55:04] <PCatinean> i mean to set it to unchecked/deselected
[05:55:12] <PCatinean> right now I onlyknow with prop()
[05:55:15] <taplar> uh, prop('checked', false) perhaps
[05:56:16] <PCatinean> hmm doesn't work with select, I had to add another line with selected, false
[05:58:06] <Cork> PCatinean: a select isn't selected it has the value of the selected option
[05:58:22] <Cork> so what you're asking for doesn't really make sense
[05:59:09] <garethdaine> Guys how do you handle the situation where an element is updated via AJAX then you visit a new page, click back and that element is now reverted. For example, an add to basket button adds an item to the cart, which then updates the header with the item totals. You visit the basket and then click back but the total is now at 0 unless you refresh the page?
[06:01:05] <PCatinean> Cork, regardless of if it's a select or a input[radio/checkbox] on a certain condition I want that the option is not selected
[06:01:32] <PCatinean> So a select is like you never touched it, just what prop('selected',false) does on a option
[06:01:49] <taplar> that would be setting the selected index to 0
[06:02:21] <taplar> or whatever your 'default' select is if there is one
[06:02:21] <PCatinean> so I need to check on the input type nontheless
[06:02:42] <PCatinean> if type option then set to index 0 of parent (the <select>) otherwise uncheck
[06:02:52] <taplar> yup, or do something funky
[06:03:39] <PCatinean> funky tooown!
[06:03:56] <PCatinean> or I could do just prop checked and selected to false, seems to work
[06:24:30] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[06:24:35] <taplar> sure
[06:24:37] <PCatinean> hell yeah!
[06:24:42] <PCatinean> I had to do it, sorry
[06:25:00] <hellyeah> hahaha
[06:25:06] <hellyeah> i like to say "hellyeah"
[06:25:18] <hellyeah> so no problem there is also metal band hellyeah check it out
[06:25:25] <hellyeah> :XD
[06:25:52] <hellyeah> first of all hope my english is clear
[06:25:53] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/4/  button must be animated. Click the animated button and then click image hand button you will see checkboxes which are checked in default. So first row of table is red. I expect button is animated with Red when checkbox is checked. But button start animated if you unchecked red checkboxes. What canthis be happened? i put some comment i try to make code clean
[06:26:35] <crippa> Cork:
[06:26:42] <crippa> Cork: still around?
[06:26:48] <hellyeah> this is decent http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/9/
[06:27:40] <Cork> crippa: if you have a question just ask it, you don't have to direct it at someone
[06:27:51] <hellyeah> anyone pls give me some help
[06:31:10] <hellyeah> anyone :D
[06:49:42] <decx> that's not a testcase, that's a whole test wardrobe
[06:53:39] <hellyeah> need some help
[06:53:41] <taplar> it also still have the ff issue, which now appears to have also propagated to the clicking of the thumbs up button
[06:55:35] <hellyeah> i dont know how to fix ff issue
[06:56:12] <taplar> debug my man, debug.  we've given you pointers, but you need to learn to dig
[06:56:33] <taplar> telling you the solution doesn't teach you
[06:56:58] <hellyeah> i try to debug
[06:59:05] <hellyeah> you could give me some tips anyway i have to put myself together
[06:59:40] <taplar> it says 'error' is undefined.  find your uses of 'error'.  make sure they exist.  if they do not, back track to see why
[07:01:46] <hellyeah> let me check this issue
[07:02:40] <hellyeah> taplar:  did you get this ReferenceError: event is not defined
[07:04:39] <ManDay> Hello.
[07:06:35] <ManDay> I run $.post( "/?ajax=1...",{ "requests[ ]": [ "asdasd","sdfsdf" ] },somefunc( ) )  but on the server, the $_POST is empty - any idea whay?
[07:08:38] <piXonix> ManDay: are you using PHP on the server?
[07:08:44] <ManDay> piXonix: yes
[07:09:02] <piXonix> let's simplify for a test
[07:09:08] <piXonix> try this: $.post( "test.php", { 'choices[]': [ "Jon", "Susan" ] } );
[07:09:24] <piXonix> and in your PHP you want to print_r('choices');
[07:09:33] <piXonix> that should at least show you something
[07:09:38] <ManDay> heh? you mean $_POST[ "choices"] ?
[07:09:45] <piXonix> yes, sorry
[07:10:11] <piXonix> you could simplify further and try: $.post( "test.php", { name: "John", time: "2pm" } );
[07:10:17] <piXonix> as that is also a post array when it hits PHP
[07:10:37] <taplar> hellyeah: yes
[07:10:41] <piXonix> I think part of your issue is that you are including a ? in your URL, which is a GET, not a POST
[07:11:08] <ManDay> piXonix: How do you suggest I check what comes to the server?
[07:11:25] <ManDay> fine, ill think of something
[07:11:50] <taplar> you can mix get and post parameters in php, atleast
[07:11:52] <piXonix> well, if you echo the array sent to the PHP file, and return that to your JS you can log or alert it
[07:11:58] <hellyeah> taplar:  it said line 474 my html is 92 lines my js is 284 lines
[07:12:07] <hellyeah> css counts?
[07:12:13] <ManDay> piXonix: Then I'd have to add a callback to the ajax
[07:12:32] <piXonix> ManDay: jsut to test
[07:12:35] <piXonix> *just
[07:12:40] <ManDay> What?!
[07:12:43] <ManDay> just to test what?
[07:12:47] <piXonix> one sec
[07:13:10] <taplar> hellyeah: find your uses (Ctrl + F) of 'error', console.log() them and see which one(s) are not defined.  go from there
[07:13:55] <ManDay> piXonix: I've done it with file_put_contents on the server
[07:14:00] <ManDay> the $_POST is still empty
[07:14:14] <piXonix> ManDay: try this
[07:14:25] <piXonix> PHP
[07:14:25] <piXonix> <?php
[07:14:25] <piXonix> echo $_POST[‘name’];
[07:14:27] <piXonix> ?>
[07:14:33] <ManDay> ?
[07:14:33] <piXonix> and then in your JS
[07:14:39] <piXonix> JS
[07:14:39] <piXonix> $.post("test.php",{name:"John",time:"2pm"},function(result){
[07:14:39] <piXonix> 	alert(result);
[07:14:41] <piXonix> });
[07:14:51] <ManDay> Sorry but this is futile
[07:14:59] <ManDay> I've already checked the $_POST is still emtpy, as before
[07:15:00] <piXonix> that should test a POST to a PHP file and make sure that the value is being seen
[07:15:29] <taplar> ManDay: got a fiddle with your js?
[07:15:40] <ManDay> taplar: hm?
[07:15:47] <piXonix> ManDay: can you repaste your code?
[07:15:59] <hellyeah> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2974601/event-is-not-defined-in-firefox-but-ok-in-chrome-and-ie
[07:16:00] <ManDay> the js code? sure...
[07:16:06] <piXonix> yes please
[07:16:15] <hellyeah> damn idiot ff
[07:16:25] <ManDay> http://dpaste.com/04BRF3S
[07:16:55] <ManDay> i really don't see what's there to find in the code. it's simply $.post like you said
[07:16:59] <taplar> ff forces you to know what your doing, :P
[07:16:59] <Cork> hellyeah: you mean the one doing it wrong is the one following the spec?
[07:17:22] <piXonix> I am going to use your code in a quick test on my end
[07:17:22] <hellyeah> Cork:  it worked for chrome and i.e. not firefox
[07:17:42] <taplar> hellyeah: which meant chrome and ie were protecting you from screwing up
[07:17:54] <hellyeah> hahah
[07:18:18] <ManDay> piXonix: don't bother
[07:18:21] <ManDay> i found the error
[07:18:27] <piXonix> cool
[07:18:36] <hellyeah> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12814065/firefox-throws-event-not-defined-while-running-the-code
[07:18:44] <ManDay> in firebug, i got a 302 back from a redirect i set up
[07:18:50] <ManDay> something's messed up on the server
[07:18:55] <ManDay> thanks!
[07:18:56] <piXonix> ahhhh, I hate those kind of things
[07:22:53] <ManDay> piXonix: All right, fixed it. I had a redirect policty which would create redirects from all POST requests which, for normal pages, had the effect that F5 wouldn't give a warning. But for the ajax that messed it up
[07:22:57] <ManDay> thanks again for your help!
[07:23:07] <hellyeah> ff is stupid
[07:23:14] <hellyeah> have some problems with jquery uş
[07:23:17] <piXonix> ManDay: no worries
[07:23:18] <hellyeah> ıi*
[07:23:21] <hellyeah> ui
[07:23:33] <piXonix> sometimes trying to explain it to someone else makes you think a little differently
[07:23:38] <taplar> never assume the browser will protect you
[07:23:43] <piXonix> and you stumble upon the answer
[07:24:01] <taplar> do that, and you have browser dependent code
[07:26:15] <Cork> hellyeah: ya, cause ie implemented it none standard and webkit followed ie cause the web didn't care about webkit back then
[07:26:39] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:27:04] <hellyeah> firefox is web kit?
[07:27:10] <Cork> the structure is that the first argument to the callback from an event handler has the event object
[07:27:17] <Cork> hellyeah: no, but chrome is
[07:27:25] <hellyeah> chrome and ie i guess
[07:27:30] <hellyeah> it worked on i.e.
[07:27:34] <Cork> well it is blink, but blink is a fork of webkit
[07:27:44] <hellyeah> probably firefox has some problem with modal window
[07:27:51] <Cork> ...
[07:27:52] <Cork> no
[07:27:57] <hellyeah> Cork:  ic
[07:28:02] <Cork> the problem is that window.event isn't meant to be a global
[07:28:09] <Cork> but ie has it as one
[07:28:15] <hellyeah> ic
[07:28:17] <Cork> and webkit simulated it
[07:28:30] <ifohancroft> Hey guys. I have an array of selected options. How can I foreach through them and check for each of them, what is the value of a json object containing such key?
[07:28:55] <taplar> basic array or jquery object?
[07:28:59] <Cork> ifohancroft: "selected options"?
[07:29:00] <hellyeah> i did  $(document).on("change", "#checkbox4", function (event) {
[07:29:07] <hellyeah> still not working on firefox
[07:29:10] <GFXDude> I started playing around with some HTML 5 wysiwyg editors, and I really like the functionality of Raptor, but i'm having some trouble using it to do more than just instantiate an editor. Every example on the site simply shows $('#myDiv').raptor({ options }); to instantiate the editor. How, then, can I use the RaptorWidget functions from the API: https://www.raptor-editor.com/documentation/api
[07:29:10] <GFXDude> /symbols/RaptorWidget
[07:29:18] <Cork> hellyeah: then your problem is something else
[07:29:25] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/dLf29mkL/11/
[07:29:36] <hellyeah> Cork:  can you take a look for a sec?
[07:29:46] <Cork> too much code, so no
[07:29:47] <ifohancroft> taplar: On click of a button a get the list of options that have been selected from an html select element
[07:29:50] <hellyeah> okey
[07:30:00] <GFXDude> ifohancroft, what are you wanting to check for though?
[07:30:08] <GFXDude> You just want to turn the array into a json object?
[07:30:29] <taplar> for a jquery collection you can use $.each(), for a basic array you can use theArray.forEach(function(elem){})
[07:30:54] <ifohancroft> I want to check what is the type of selected option. If it will be about integer I want to output one kind of input elements, if type in the json equals boolean I want to output something else
[07:31:01] <GFXDude> And to convert the array to json object you can do JSON.strigify(theArray)
[07:31:18] <Cork> ifohancroft: $.map($('select :selected'), function(elm) { return obj[elm.val()]; });
[07:31:24] <Cork> that should give you what you want
[07:31:34] <Cork> "obj" is the object you want to make the lookup in
[07:31:53] <ifohancroft> Cork: Thank you. I will try that.
[07:32:13] <Cork> ifohancroft: opps elm.val() should be elm.value
[07:32:23] <Cork> old habit die hard :)
[07:32:46] <taplar> better than wrapping it just to use val() :P
[07:33:07] <Cork> taplar: well that was basically what i almost did...
[07:33:13] <ifohancroft> Btw in case I couldn't explain well - I am looking how can I do the equivalent of this: foreach ($options as $options) { if ($array[$option] == 'integer') {do something;} else {doSomething else;} }
[07:33:26] <ifohancroft> where $options contains the selected values of the option elements
[07:33:51] <Cork> ifohancroft: ah, the  $.map gives you an array of the translated values
[07:33:59] <taplar> selected values plural?  like a select with a size > 1?
[07:34:01] <Cork> if you just want to loop the values use $.each
[07:34:08] <Cork> yes
[07:34:10] <ifohancroft> Yes, taplar
[07:34:21] <taplar> cool, i hardly ever see those used, :D
[07:34:28] <Cork> that's why i used $('select :selected')
[07:34:32] <Cork> taplar: me too
[07:35:48] <Cork> i usually use a fieldset and checkboxes instead
[07:36:00] <Cork> gives a much more usable design
[07:36:15] <ifohancroft> Cork: I know I can use .each I there are certain stuff in the syntax though of the whole thing that I am not sure ho wo to do
[07:36:19] <ifohancroft> how*
[07:37:14] <Cork> $('select :selected').each(function() { if(options[this.value] == 'integer') {} else {} });
[07:37:20] <Cork> to simulate your php code
[07:37:26] <ifohancroft> thank you
[07:39:14] <GFXDude> Per this example on github (https://github.com/PANmedia/raptor-example/blob/master/examples/save-custom/example.php)    I feel should be able to do $("#myDiv").raptor.getHtml()
[07:40:14] <GFXDude> But the API has the Raptor namespace, of which I assumed I could do: Raptor.getInstances() to get RaptorWidget objects, but console argues that Rapter doesn't exist (https://www.raptor-editor.com/documentation/api/symbols/Raptor)
[07:48:36] <cerkauskas> hello. I have strange problem with form submitting. I try $("#myForm").submit(), no errors occur but form isnt submitted. :/ any alternatives or some ways to debug?
[07:49:00] <taplar> GFXDude: i'm thinking Raptor is a php namespace...
[07:49:16] <taplar> from what little I can tell from jumping around this repo
[07:49:46] <GFXDude> I had that thought too, but API lists everything as 'defined in raptor.js' or 'thisPlugin.js'
[07:50:53] <taplar> cerkauskas: console log your $("#myForm") to make sure it is finding the element
[07:51:28] <taplar> or just execute that in your console rather than putting it in the code
[07:52:42] <cerkauskas> $("#myForm") and $("#myForm").submit() gives the same output.
[07:54:12] <taplar> ??
[07:57:01] <taplar> GFXDude: stepping aside from the namespace thing, what are you trying to do?  get the html of the div?
[08:07:23] <computer2000> Hey all. I'm calling $(element).text('some text'); to an element indefinitely very very quickly to update a label for a changing value... it seems the UI hangs after ~30 seconds, is it because chrome can't handle that?
[08:07:38] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[08:07:45] <robertmaxrees> why are you updating it so much so fast?
[08:29:28] <rrrosenfeld> Hello, this signature doesn't make any sense to me and it's not clear what it does from the description: http://api.jquery.com/toggleclass/#toggleClass-state
[08:29:47] <rrrosenfeld> Is this signature indeed supported? If so, what does it do?
[08:30:35] <robertmaxrees> if it's listed there, it's supported for now.
[08:30:37] <robertmaxrees> let's take a look.
[08:31:46] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jdoedx2v/
[08:32:56] <robertmaxrees> implicit removal of whatever you selected.
[08:33:06] <robertmaxrees> *removal of the class you selected on, rather.
[08:33:18] <robertmaxrees> just like doing $('.foo').toggleClass();
[08:35:41] <shoky_> heh isn't that a bug really
[08:35:47] <shoky_> a bug in docs maybe
[08:36:16] <shoky_> state  A boolean value to determine whether the class should be added or removed.
[08:36:20] <shoky_> and you passed true
[08:36:29] <shoky_> implying that the class should be added, not removed
[08:36:39] <robertmaxrees> it's an optional field, too.
[08:36:43] <robertmaxrees> which is funky.
[08:36:52] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if that was originally a bug that became a feature.
[08:37:02] <robertmaxrees> (this is a big reason i don't like toggles)
[08:37:33] <shoky_> .toggleClass(class, state)  is useful
[08:37:34] <taplar> lol, why use toggleClass(true) instead of addClass, heh
[08:37:37] <shoky_> but this one is weird
[08:37:54] <robertmaxrees> taplar that removes the class ;)
[08:38:15] <shoky_> according to docs it should toggle all classes the element had, the first time toggleClass is called
[08:38:15] <taplar> oh, remove = true
[08:38:27] <robertmaxrees> taplar but remove also = false
[08:38:27] <shoky_> no, remove = false
[08:38:32] <taplar> lol
[08:38:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jdoedx2v/2/
[08:38:53] <robertmaxrees> these all do the same thing
[08:39:37] <shoky_> yeah but
[08:39:44] <shoky_> here it functions correctly  http://jsfiddle.net/jdoedx2v/3/
[08:39:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm not saying it's a good thing.
[08:39:59] <robertmaxrees> just that's how it functions today.
[08:40:10] <shoky_> yeah just showing they don't all do the same thing
[08:40:19] <robertmaxrees> shoky_ that version removes and then adds it.
[08:40:25] <shoky_> .toggleClass(true)  will add classes if you removed them beofre with toggleClas
[08:40:29] <shoky_> riht
[08:40:31] <shoky_> right
[08:40:35] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah.  correct.
[08:41:05] <shoky_> anyways
[08:41:07] <shoky_> rrrosenfeld++
[08:41:09] <taplar> it'd do that without the true too...
[08:41:37] <shoky_> right, but having the state arugment there lets you pass a variable
[08:41:48] <robertmaxrees> it's also implicit based on the boolean.
[08:46:11] <Nooutlet> https://jsfiddle.net/jdoedx2v/4/
[08:47:56] <shoky_> yea  toggleClass() and toggleClass(true)  have identical behaviour
[08:48:08] <NoOutlet> Yep.
[08:50:53] <taplar> ah, but ('class', true) does not
[08:50:57] <taplar> it remains
[08:51:17] <shoky_> yea no problem with that signature
[08:51:23] <shoky_> i've used it plenty
[08:55:36] <voiter> does jquery offer a way to disable autocomplete?
[08:56:53] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#method-disable
[08:57:47] <voiter> thanks
[09:11:15] <rrrosenfeld> Hi, sorry, I had to take a call just after asking here. I read the answers, thanks for those. But I still think that if this feature is indeed desired it should at least be better documented so that it's clear what it does. Specially what [state] means. It seems that when state is not passed it's assumed to be true, but this is not documented either.
[09:13:01] <robertmaxrees> rrrosenfeld i would file a bug or go to #jquery-dev and give them that feedback :)
[09:16:47] <arthurvr> rrrosenfeld: we’re really happy to take any feedback you have :)
[09:16:52] <robertmaxrees> :D
[09:16:55] <robertmaxrees> arthurvr++
[09:16:58] <rrrosenfeld> Thanks, robert, will do so
[09:20:58] <jak2000> i want trnslate the javascript function: http://pastie.org/10304529  to jquery function, but not display the alert  the jquery function why?
[09:21:02] <jak2000> *translate
[09:21:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:21:55] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 those are both pure javascript.
[09:21:59] <arthurvr> jak2000: What’s a cosnole? :) And this has nothing to do with jQuery ;)
[09:22:00] <robertmaxrees> neither one of thuse uses jquery.
[09:22:08] <jak2000> huuu
[09:22:15] <jak2000> ok friends, console not display anything
[09:22:30] <arthurvr> because you typed `cosnole`
[09:22:30] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you misspelled console in your code.
[09:22:31] <jak2000> the first function, how to translate to jQuery? any advice?
[09:22:32] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:22:57] <jak2000> glup really
[09:23:00] <jak2000> removed...
[09:23:01] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:26:56] <jak2000> doneee
[09:26:57] <jak2000> arghh
[09:27:10] <jak2000> how to translate to jQuery?
[09:27:20] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 nothing you're doing there uses jquery.
[09:27:29] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 also: jquery IS javascript - it's not a separate language :)
[09:27:52] <jak2000> ok
[09:28:34] <jak2000> now i have a Select option, with 3 options: 1) Select... 2)High 2)Low  how to select with js or jquery the first element? thanks
[09:28:56] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 have you considered going to learn.jquery.com and going through the information there?
[09:29:52] <jak2000> yes in times i go to learn, but now i need solve this problem
[09:30:02] * jak2000 googling
[09:30:14] <robertmaxrees> then make a fiddle and show us what you're tried.
[09:30:18] <robertmaxrees> *you've
[09:30:47] <jak2000> ok thanks
[09:39:06] <MikeD_> is there a way to assign a priority to event handlers if there is more than one assigned to the same event?
[09:39:13] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[09:39:43] <robertmaxrees> assign a single handler and handle your logic within that instead.
[09:40:14] <MikeD_> if that was an easy solution, i'd have done that already :)  i know what you're saying though.
[09:40:55] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue you're having?
[09:41:32] <lindii_> any explanation why i cant do this https://jsfiddle.net/pbdpg9oL/
[09:42:38] <robertmaxrees> lindii_ that means you're running $conversationContainer = $(".conversation-activity-list"); before that element exists.\
[09:42:39] <MikeD_> a ton of code was already tested and working and now we're introducing complicated dependencies... and the order of operations seems to be a problem... i haven't fully sleuthed it yet though, so maybe there is a sidestep I can use
[09:43:42] <lindii_> robertmaxrees: so how can i assign this object correctly
[09:43:49] <robertmaxrees> lindii_ you can't.
[09:43:55] <robertmaxrees> you can't select it before it exists,
[09:44:14] <rrrosenfeld> <m_gol> rrosenfeld: yeah, ot seems not described very well... could you open an issue at https://github.com/jquery/api.jquery.com/issues?
[09:44:15] <lindii_> good point
[09:44:19] <rrrosenfeld> will do that now
[09:44:20] <lindii_> thanks :)
[09:44:38] <robertmaxrees> rrrosenfeld did you mean that for this channel?
[09:44:53] <rrrosenfeld> I told that there too, I'm just giving you some feedback :)
[09:45:04] <robertmaxrees> rrrosenfeld i'm already in that channel and watching ;)
[09:45:11] <rrrosenfeld> ah, okay then :)
[09:46:38] <taplar> yeeeah, bistro had chicken parm sliders today, :D
[09:47:42] <ManDay> Could you give me hint how I exchange an ID'd element? There is a <tbody id="ME">  and I need to take its contents out of the DOM (I still need the contents before I can dispose of them - so I guess taking the <tbody> out as a whole I should take) and replace it by something else. So I best would rip the whole tbody out and replace it by another tbody which I have "prepared" - which commands should I look into?
[09:48:25] <taplar> replacewith at end
[09:48:33] <ManDay> cool
[09:49:06] <ManDay> taplar: the ID I can simply set as an attr on the "prepared" tbody?
[09:49:25] <taplar> sure or prop()
[09:50:00] <sk0al> http://jsfiddle.net/hv0ts95L/1/ could someone please help me figure out why my getJSON request on line 32 is not letting me get at any of the data returned?
[09:52:06] <robertmaxrees> sk0al because that's async.
[09:52:24] <robertmaxrees> you need to put any logic that relies on it within a done callback.
[09:52:58] <robertmaxrees> aslo, the getJSON request isn't failing - the out ajax call is.
[09:53:33] <robertmaxrees> ManDay you can also .empty() that tbdoy and append new contents for it.
[09:54:56] <sk0al> robertmaxrees:  Guess I don't quite understand. I have added a callback function in the getJSON
[09:55:15] <robertmaxrees> sk0al i guess i'm confused about what problems you're experiencing.
[09:55:25] <robertmaxrees> i see the alert fire, but that's not because of the getJSON call.
[09:55:56] <sk0al> on line 33 when it runs the getJSON I see in firebug console that its grabbing all the urls in that foreach and returning the c orrect info. But I can't seem to get at the response from the getJSON results
[09:56:19] <sk0al> yea it probably won't work properly because its not in the same domain
[09:56:36] <robertmaxrees> so the data is or isn't console logging correctly?
[09:57:09] <sk0al> I can see it in console.log just fine. the getJSON is going to the url and the url is correct and then on the response tab I see what I am after. However, I can't seem to get at that info with the js
[09:57:33] <robertmaxrees> you're getting at it within generateBrandUrl - anyuthing that relies on that data needs to be in that callback.
[09:57:58] <sk0al> yes but nothing I put inside generateBrandUrl shows up...
[09:58:15] <sk0al> none of those 3 items in there are showing on my console in firebug
[09:59:43] <ManDay> There is another problem!
[09:59:55] <robertmaxrees> lol i must really be missing something - it's console logging out of that function just fine, but nothing in that function works?  i'd replace document.body.textContent = data;  with an append of some kind instead i guess.
[10:00:51] <sk0al> I mean, when I visit the site I don't see any of those tests... You can see that exact code work here and see results in console.log http://www.mindimage.net/CSE/cseChallenge.html
[10:00:59] <ManDay> The elements in the tbody include some <input type="text" field> - is it possible to have the cursor of the user remain in a field which re-occurs (i could, of course, identify it, but can I place their cursor)?
[10:01:09] <notchris> In a jquery object, I know I can object.example to set an item
[10:01:13] <notchris> Can I do something like
[10:01:18] <notchris> object.example.example
[10:01:22] <notchris> To add items to an item?
[10:01:25] <notchris> If that makes sense.
[10:01:40] <taplar> so long as the first example exists first
[10:03:30] <notchris> So like..
[10:03:37] <notchris> var tickets = {};
[10:03:40] <notchris> Then..
[10:03:40] <notchris> tickets.adult = {};
[10:03:42] <notchris> ?
[10:03:52] <taplar> ManDay: not sure if moving an element from one parent to another would preserve it's focus or not.  If not you case do document.focusedElement i believe to get the currently focused element and get it's id or class to later re-focus on
[10:03:55] <notchris> And I can then declare tickets.adult.price?
[10:04:02] <taplar> yup
[10:04:07] <notchris> <3
[10:04:22] <taplar> or var tickets = { adult: { price: "" }};
[10:04:23] <ManDay> taplar: not sufficient, I'm afraid. I need to position the cursor.
[10:04:36] <ManDay> I'm actually not only moving the element, I'm replacing it (for my convenience)
[10:04:46] <taplar> ah
[10:04:46] <ManDay> but oh well, i guess I'll use a different approach then which is nicer
[10:04:54] <taplar> you can do that, sure
[10:05:15] <ManDay> taplar: position the cursor?
[10:05:17] <taplar> something like textarea.selectionStart and selectionEnd, one sec
[10:05:23] <ManDay> aye
[10:05:25] <ManDay> no I see
[10:06:38] <taplar> yeah, selectionStart and selectionEnd
[10:07:13] <taplar> if your just after placement, the two would be equal
[10:08:39] <jak2000>  http://pastie.org/10304568   why say me a error message: "mensajealerta is not defined" if i rename the line 33 to mensajealerta it work, but i need work with jQuery, thanks.
[10:09:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:09:11] <robertmaxrees> where are you getting that error?
[10:09:44] <taplar> maybe since it's outside the document ready?  scope difference?
[10:09:55] <robertmaxrees> i don't see where he's accessing that function outside the doc ready.,
[10:10:03] <robertmaxrees> but if that's what he's doing, then yes.
[10:10:20] <taplar> true, i see double assignments
[10:10:43] <robertmaxrees> i don't.
[10:10:47] <robertmaxrees> those are both spelled differently.
[10:10:55] <taplar> ah, the x
[10:10:57] <taplar> lol
[10:10:58] <jak2000> when calll the function: mensajealerta
[10:11:01] <taplar> back to my food
[10:11:05] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 from where?
[10:11:16] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 are you trying to call it from outside the document ready?
[10:18:49] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: http://pastie.org/10304583
[10:18:53] <jak2000> see line 95
[10:18:56] <jak2000> please
[10:18:57] <robertmaxrees> that's... not helpful.
[10:19:28] <robertmaxrees> and i don't see where you have mensajealerta defined.
[10:19:33] <robertmaxrees> i see xmensajealerta
[10:21:08] <taplar> egh, i also see 4 separate script blocks
[10:21:20] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't matter.
[10:21:27] <taplar> i know
[10:21:29] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're confused about how scope works in JS.
[10:22:36] <jak2000> yes forget pelase xmensajealerta
[10:22:42] <robertmaxrees> uh
[10:22:45] <robertmaxrees> then i can't help you.
[10:22:53] <jak2000> see line 9 right here the file:
[10:22:57] <robertmaxrees> please make a functioning fiddle.
[10:23:13] <jak2000> http://pastie.org/10304587 line 26
[10:23:15] <jak2000> ok thanks
[10:23:34] <robertmaxrees> okay - mensajealerta  in that paste only exists inside the document ready.
[10:23:39] <robertmaxrees> not anywhere else.
[10:23:40] <rubyonrailed> Anyone have a favorite live number formatting plugin?
[10:23:46] <robertmaxrees> that's why you're getting that error, jak2000
[10:23:59] <robertmaxrees> variables defined inside of functions aren't available outside of thoe functions.
[10:24:15] <jak2000> ok, then need declare outside same as: line 33 ?
[10:24:29] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[10:40:42] <ManDay> Is $("document").find( "..." )  the same as $( "..." ) ?
[10:40:53] <robertmaxrees> $(document).find(), and sort of.
[10:40:56] <robertmaxrees> functionally similar.
[10:41:19] <ManDay> ty
[10:49:12] <saml> given a <form>, how can I get urlencoded version of form data?
[10:49:30] <saml> i want to submit the form using xhr
[10:49:49] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery serialize
[10:49:50] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .serialize() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[10:49:56] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:50:33] <saml> oh thanks
[10:51:02] <notchris> If I an multiplying two object items value
[10:51:05] <notchris> tickets.adult.price * tickets.adult.quantity
[10:51:11] <notchris> And they are both integers
[10:51:20] <notchris> How do I use .toFixed(2)
[10:51:29] <notchris> Without creating a separate variable
[10:51:41] <robertmaxrees> (tickets.adult.price * tickets.adult.quantity).toFixed(2)
[10:51:43] <taplar> (x * y).toFixes(2) ?
[10:51:53] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Thank you!
[10:51:58] <notchris> taplar: Thank you as well
[10:52:40] <notchris> Ohh
[10:52:43] <notchris> It did not like that
[10:52:44] <notchris> hmm
[10:53:04] <notchris> Ah nm
[10:53:07] <notchris> It worked!
[10:53:12] <taplar> lol
[10:53:18] <taplar> rollercoaster of emotions
[10:53:32] <notchris> Must I enclose a single object item in parenth. to use toFixed?
[10:53:37] <notchris> In ex: Can I do...
[10:53:42] <notchris> tickets.adult.price.toFixed(2)
[10:53:44] <taplar> to force the order
[10:54:00] <taplar> you can do that, sure
[10:54:08] <notchris> Ahh
[10:55:07] <robertmaxrees> fwiw doing math in js is a bad idea in the first place.
[10:55:23] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nu9trq0y/
[10:56:22] <notchris> Why?
[10:56:29] <robertmaxrees> open your console on that fiddle.
[10:56:43] <notchris> 0.3000000000000000
[10:56:56] <robertmaxrees> there should be a 4 at the end of that.
[10:57:08] <notchris> There is
[10:57:11] <notchris> How does it get 4?
[10:57:13] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:57:27] <robertmaxrees> welcome to a quirk in how computers deal with floating-point numbers.
[10:58:23] <notchris> Weird
[10:58:34] <notchris> Sort of like how a palindrome is a palindrome
[10:59:44] <taplar> huh?
[11:00:25] <notchris> Exactly.
[11:00:30] <pokergod> when doing $('test').text(undefined) .. it detects it as a get.  What's the clean way to do this?   $('test').text(data[val]?data[val]:"") ?
[11:00:32] <taplar> no..... lol
[11:01:06] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:01:36] <notchris> I’m just kidding
[11:01:45] <notchris> Even though a palindrome is a palindrome
[11:02:29] <taplar> pokergod: why not only set if the value is set?
[11:02:48] <robertmaxrees> pokergod what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:02:59] <pokergod> I want to wipe whatever was there with the new text in every instance
[11:03:04] <pokergod> whether it's undefined or not
[11:03:12] <pokergod> this works, but i wanted to know a cleaner method
[11:03:17] <robertmaxrees> then do $('test').text('newText');
[11:03:29] <robertmaxrees> oh i see what you're saying.
[11:04:06] <taplar> what is ""+ undefined?  is it still ""?
[11:04:14] <pokergod> i thought the undefined value passed in would set to '' and not turn it into a getter
[11:04:32] <robertmaxrees> pokergod the function checks to see if the arg is undefined.
[11:04:34] <robertmaxrees> ]:)
[11:04:39] <robertmaxrees> if it's undefined, it's a getter.
[11:05:03] <robertmaxrees> taplar it's 'undefined'
[11:05:07] <robertmaxrees> as in, the string.
[11:05:09] <robertmaxrees> because coercion.
[11:05:26] <taplar> yeah, figured something like that
[11:05:40] <sk0al> robertmaxrees: You have any idea why as soon as I put my generated HTML inside the getJSON function it quit sorting by numberSoldInLast30Days? http://jsfiddle.net/hv0ts95L/2/
[11:06:31] <pokergod> from the console, can I generate events?   can I simulate an onclick with values being passed in?  The rows i have onclick don't have the stuff I need to debug.  Unless I get lucky and it scrolls by.
[11:06:47] <pokergod> I want to generate an onclick with the value looked up in the db that i know will get me where i need to eb
[11:07:22] <taplar> yes, but typically events don't pass things in
[11:08:11] <robertmaxrees> sk0al not sure i understand.
[11:09:12] <sk0al> robertmaxrees: Well on line 20 - 22 you can see where i am filtering the results descending from numberSoldInLast30Days ?
[11:09:18] <PCatinean> I figured that if I want to get all the options available on a page that have the class .cfg_input
[11:09:30] <sk0al> when I pull thHTML out from the getJSON function it sorts just fine
[11:09:31] <robertmaxrees> sk0al let's back up - i can't see your data, and you've tossed a pretty big fiddle at me.
[11:09:36] <PCatinean> It's best I would do: http://hastebin.com/ofepofokad.coffee
[11:09:37] <robertmaxrees> not sure how you expect me to be able to help.
[11:09:44] <PCatinean> what is the best way to concatenate two of such arrays?
[11:09:55] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean they're not arrays.
[11:10:04] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean check out the jquery .add() method.
[11:10:05] <PCatinean> I assumed so :)) can I just add them?
[11:10:07] <robertmaxrees> read the docs first, though.
[11:10:09] <robertmaxrees> no, you cannot.
[11:10:20] <PCatinean> I just need both of them, or maybe do a double selector or something
[11:10:37] <taplar> PCatinean: selectors can be separated with a comma
[11:10:42] <taplar> within the quotes
[11:10:49] <sk0al> it is because of the CORS. you can view data here. http://www.mindimage.net/CSE/cseChallenge.html
[11:10:56] <taplar> $('div, span')
[11:11:10] <robertmaxrees> you could also do var $newCollection = option_elements.add(input_elements);, but i'd avoid that in favor of a simple .find('.cfg_input:checked, select.cfg_input option:checked');
[11:11:28] <robertmaxrees> sk0al make a basic fiddle tackling the specific issue.
[11:11:52] <PCatinean> taplar, I guess that would be the best choice!
[11:12:09] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean do you need the two separate vars?
[11:12:24] <robertmaxrees> because i showed you how you combine two jquery objects.
[11:12:25] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, no that's the point I just need one and I want to traverse them all
[11:12:33] <robertmaxrees> then use a single .find()
[11:12:41] <sk0al> Well if i leave anything out you won't see what is happening. I guess I am not sure how to present that to you
[11:12:46] <ManDay> Is there function to move an element somewhere else or is it always detach( ) followed by whatever?
[11:13:03] <robertmaxrees> ManDay .append() et al automatically detach first for you.
[11:13:08] <taplar> ^ beat me
[11:13:11] <ManDay> ah well, that's cool
[11:13:11] <robertmaxrees> sk0al your issue is you're sorting things but that sort isn't working, right?
[11:13:12] <ManDay> thanks
[11:13:17] <sk0al> I mean everything works fine. Except when I put theHTML vars inside the getJSON function it quit the sorting that was happening on line 20
[11:13:21] <sk0al> yes
[11:13:33] <robertmaxrees> double-check to make sure that's really the issue then.
[11:13:34] <sk0al> it does work if i remove the function at line 27
[11:13:37] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, no clue.
[11:13:47] <robertmaxrees> that's a really big, non functioning code sample :)
[11:14:13] <sk0al> well only because of cross site scripting I can't make it function on the fiddle..
[11:14:24] <robertmaxrees> right, but it's still a huge fiddle lol
[11:14:31] <taplar> it's a chello
[11:14:36] <robertmaxrees> *cello
[11:14:40] <robertmaxrees> your problem is sorting, not ajax.
[11:14:47] <robertmaxrees> that's why i'm sort of baffled why you're including everything else.
[11:14:51] <sk0al> Yes, well its something with thte function at line 27.. because if I remove it then it sorts just fine
[11:15:51] <ManDay> I don't get it... append( ) inserts something as the last child, prepend( ) inserts something as the first child. Is there no function which inserts something at a given point in the middle

[11:16:11] <robertmaxrees> sk0al you're aware that $.getJSON() won't return finish things in order, right?
[11:16:42] <robertmaxrees> ie - doing foo, bar, baz might come back baz, foo, bar, etc?
[11:16:43] <sk0al> no, maybe that is whats happening. So once getJSON gets its info its messing up my sort order?
[11:16:51] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[11:16:57] <robertmaxrees> ajax calls finish when they finish.
[11:17:08] <robertmaxrees> they're firing in order, but they can complete out of order.
[11:17:18] <sk0al> Do you have any suggestions on how to keep it sorted in the correct order?
[11:17:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd read up about deferreds and how you handle this particular scenario.
[11:17:22] <sk0al> yes I think that is whats happening
[11:17:30] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you need to sort the responses instead and go from ther.
[11:17:34] <robertmaxrees> *there
[11:17:57] <sk0al> sort the response after the getJSON function is done?
[11:18:17] <robertmaxrees> push the responses into an array and sort that instead.
[11:33:52] <pokergod> if you do JSON.parse() can you chain if it returns an object?
[11:34:05] <robertmaxrees> you can chain object methods on it, yeah.
[11:34:25] <pokergod> to keep it in the jquery chaining context, I have to use $.parseJSON() then?
[11:34:35] <pokergod> after it parses, i want to each the object ..
[11:34:38] <robertmaxrees> that returns normal JSON as well.
[11:34:44] <robertmaxrees> then you need $.each();
[11:34:50] <robertmaxrees> not $(object).each();
[11:35:05] <robertmaxrees> so $.each(JSON.parse(), function() {});
[11:36:15] <pokergod> var i = JSON.parse(..); i.name = "test"; $.each(i, function() { } )
[11:36:23] <pokergod> is there a way to change the name in one line?
[11:38:16] <robertmaxrees> i just showed you how.
[11:39:44] <yahri> Hey everybody. How would you suggest people to get started with open source? I'm mainly interested in javascript things, but not jQuery in specific. I got a GitHub account but really don't know how to get started?
[11:40:40] <pokergod> robertmaxrees, the i.name="test" override before the each tho?
[11:41:13] <stns> yahri: I or someone else could help you if you come on #github.
[11:42:53] <yahri> stns:I know how to use GitHub I just can't get started on tickets and stuff
[11:43:20] <arthurvr> yahri: ”javascript” is huge. What are you interested in specifically?
[11:44:55] <yahri> Don't know - arthurvr stns et al: what things are you all involved with? Maybe some framework or a node thing
[11:45:17] <yahri> is robertmaxrees still lurking here? He used to answer all the things lol
[11:46:23] <robertmaxrees> hah, yeah i'm around.
[11:46:31] <stns> yahri: So you're looking for a JS project on github that you can join?
[11:46:43] <robertmaxrees> yahri this is #jquery, soooo you're going to get a lot of #jquery centric stuff.
[11:46:59] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, look for projects you regularly use and give back tot hem,
[11:47:01] <pokergod> robertmaxrees, so the only way to set that i.name = "new name" would be in the each function?
[11:47:01] <robertmaxrees> *to them
[11:47:11] <robertmaxrees> pokergod why are you adding that at all?
[11:47:22] <robertmaxrees> pokergod fwiw, i hate one liners.
[11:47:24] <pokergod> i want to use the console to override the json so I can debug this
[11:47:36] <arthurvr> yahri: https://github.com/arthurvr is what I do - but you should just pick a project you’re willing to work on and you really believe
[11:47:46] <pokergod> i want one console line i can run that will change up the json so when I click it passes the correct data-json into the function
[11:48:12] <robertmaxrees> pokergod ff has a multi-line scratch pad, and both ff's and chrome's dev tools support multi-line.
[11:48:22] <robertmaxrees> shift + enter to get a new line.
[11:48:34] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, edit in an actual editor and copy/paste
[11:49:16] <yahri> Maybe I'm going to check out the MDL or the react issue tracker
[11:50:07] <pokergod> robertmaxrees, thank you, that is exactly what i was trying to get around
[11:54:29] <ManDay> Is .find() guaranteed to return the children in the correct order?
[11:54:38] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you mean by "correct
[11:54:48] <ManDay> the order from the DOM?!
[11:54:49] <pokergod> robertmaxrees, thank you, that is exactly what i was trying to get around
[11:54:59] <robertmaxrees> pokergod i saw that earlier ;)
[11:55:15] <robertmaxrees> ManDay you can safely assume it'll return them in the order they're in the document, but that's a funny word "order"
[11:55:23] <ManDay> what?
[11:55:31] <ManDay> the html spec has a notion of order
[11:55:43] <pokergod> robertmaxrees, if you have data-* variables, how do you override them?   I was thinking  $found.data('test') = "123" but it says Invalid left-hand in assignment
[11:55:50] <ManDay> <ul><li><li><li></ul>  the lis have an order
[11:55:54] <robertmaxrees> sure - and browsers actually implement that spec ManDay?
[11:55:55] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:55:58] <taplar> data('key', 'new value')
[11:56:00] <pokergod> perhaps prop('data-test',123) ?
[11:56:01] <robertmaxrees> pokergod look at the docs.
[11:56:07] <ManDay> robertmaxrees: I don't understand you.
[11:56:07] <robertmaxrees> .data('key', 'value');
[11:56:10] <taplar> exclude the data- from the key
[11:56:17] <pokergod> thanks
[11:58:41] <pokergod> test.data('test',JSON.stringify(escape(i))) gives me "[object Object]", hrm
[11:59:38] <taplar> what is test?  a raw node?
[11:59:43] <wizbit> is it possible to display the last 5 lines of a text file using jquery?
[11:59:45] <pokergod> test
[12:00:14] <taplar> is it a raw element or a jquery wrapped element?
[12:01:08] <taplar> i ask because data is a jquery function
[12:01:15] <pokergod> how slow of me, escape needs to be on the outside of JSON.stringify
[12:01:56] <ManDay> Something in the console is      Object { 0: #text "Schraube M8", length: 1, prevObject: Object, context: HTMLDocument → 127.0.0.1 }        but when I do Something.text( "TEST" )   the text remains "Schraube M8", why?
[12:03:22] <pokergod> taplar, thanks again
[12:06:15] <ManDay> Anyone?
[12:06:29] <ManDay> Something.text( ) returns "Schraueb M8" just fine, but setting it doesn't have any effect
[12:06:40] <taplar> fiddle?
[12:06:41] <ManDay> Setting it on a parent works fine, as well
[12:06:47] <ManDay> taplar: hrm
[12:06:51] <taplar> :)
[12:08:13] <taplar> wizbit: how is jquery getting this text file?
[12:08:30] <ManDay> I'll rather find a work arround :-P
[12:10:47] <wizbit> taplar: im not sure
[12:12:43] <taplar> wizbit: why i ask is, are you asking how jquery would open the file and get the last 5 lines, or are you asking with the contents of a file returned from an ajax request how would you get the last five lines?  because it would most likely have to be the latter.
[12:15:08] <taplar> in any case if you have the file as a string, you can split on '\n' to get an array of lines, and then you could access the last 5
[12:15:11] <wizbit> hmm i need to look into it
[12:15:19] <wizbit> right ok thanks
[12:15:35] <ManDay> Does anyone know what's the value to attr( "disabled",...) that renders something ENabled ?
[12:15:44] <ManDay> I'm out of options :-P
[12:15:48] <taplar> blank
[12:15:56] <YamakasY_> man it's difficult to search on share/dropbox/upload like scripts... they all only upload and don't store a thing :S
[12:15:58] <ManDay> blank?
[12:15:59] <taplar> or false maybe
[12:16:08] <taplar> or just remove it
[12:16:09] <ManDay> neither works
[12:16:14] <taplar> removeAttr()
[12:16:32] <taplar> or prop('disabled', false)
[12:17:26] <ManDay> goddamit
[12:17:47] <ManDay> i thought HTML had a spec which specified valid values for an attribute
[12:17:59] <taplar> attributes are strings
[12:18:03] <taplar> can be anything
[12:18:09] <ManDay> no, not in html
[12:18:15] <NoiseEee> ManDay: remove the "disabled" attribute entirely to enable it
[12:18:34] <taplar> you can set an attribute to anything, doesn't mean it's valid, but you can
[12:18:40] <ManDay> NoiseEee: it's annoying. i want a clean   attr( "disabled",should_it?"enabled":"disabled" )
[12:18:48] <ManDay> taplar: my point
[12:18:55] <ManDay> there must be a valid value for enabling it
[12:19:06] <NoiseEee> ManDay: no, most browsers will render an element "disabled" merely by having the attribute there, without any value
[12:19:14] <NoiseEee> ManDay: been that way since HTML 3/4 or whatever
[12:19:18] <taplar> ^
[12:19:20] <ManDay> not in XHTML
[12:19:27] <NoiseEee> ManDay: yeah but XHTML isn't real
[12:19:32] <ManDay> it was to me
[12:19:34] <NoiseEee> :)
[12:19:34] <taplar> lol
[12:19:47] <NoiseEee> anyhow... gotta remove the attribute entirely to have it enabled. good luck!
[12:20:16] <taplar> prop('disabled', !should_it)
[12:21:35] <taplar> err, no without the !
[12:21:48] <taplar> bah
[12:22:53] <pokergod> so if .data('var', undefined) turns into a getter, what value is best to pass?  null?
[12:23:31] <taplar> blank i would assume
[12:23:38] <taplar> depends on your app though
[12:24:44] <taplar> nvm, depends entirely on your app since data can take non string values like prop
[12:34:11] <seemikehack> Hey all, is there a better way to check whether or not a query found an element than !$(selector).length? It just seems a little...hacky...sort of.
[12:34:44] <taplar> how come?
[12:35:24] <ManDay> seemikehack:   you can cast it to boolean if it makes you feel better and write ==false
[12:35:27] <ManDay> :-D
[12:35:38] <ManDay> or ==0 ?
[12:35:45] <seemikehack> ManDay, hah :)
[12:35:56] <seemikehack> Yeah, === 0 is more explicit.
[12:36:09] <exactp> does anybody know what plugin allows use of $.mod() ?
[12:36:19] <taplar> modulus?
[12:36:42] <seemikehack> taplar, it's not very hacky when you consider the javascript way of doing things, for whatever reason, though, that specific case feels weird.
[12:37:11] <taplar> seemikehack: *shrug* truthyness, non zero is true
[12:37:14] <exactp> headerType = $body.mod('headertype'), - something like this
[12:37:19] <seemikehack> taplar, I use and abuse JS's particular flavor of dynamic typing for checks like that all the time, so I don't know why this one bothers me.
[12:37:33] <seemikehack> taplar, but, to be fair, it doesn't bother me that much ;)
[12:38:14] <seemikehack> ManDay, given that I duck-punch everything else, I don't think I'll be casting it to a boolean. Good suggestion though!
[12:38:16] <seemikehack> ;)
[12:39:11] <taplar> technically you don't have to check length
[12:39:25] <taplar> if you did an each off of it and put your existance logic inside
[12:41:29] <seemikehack> taplar, I don't think that would work in this case, I'm filtering and ensuring that there's no ancestor with a given class to determine whether or not the element passes the filter.
[12:41:58] <seemikehack> taplar, I may could work that into the filter, map/reduce style.
[12:42:21] <taplar> eh, just a note, :)
[12:42:33] <seemikehack> taplar, well, the list I'm filtering is a JS array, not a "jquery array"
[12:42:39] <seemikehack> taplar, yep, good point :)
[12:42:48] <mvpgraff> Is there a way to find duplicates using $.each and just display one when exporting?
[12:43:09] <taplar> what is the duplicate on?
[12:44:00] <taplar> !g jquery unique
[12:44:01] <b-ot> taplar: jQuery.unique() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.unique/
[12:44:12] <taplar> sweet, my first g usage, ^_^
[12:45:41] <exactp> I think $.mod() is something like this, https://github.com/borovin/jquery.mod
[12:45:55] <exactp> Im just not sure if this is something that is available elsewhere
[12:46:41] <exactp> It looks like a DOM listener right?
[12:47:15] <taplar> looking for a translation
[12:47:52] <exactp> I'm trying to figure out what this script is using to set the variables
[12:48:30] <mvpgraff> taplar sorry, it's from an object
[12:48:32] <exactp> headerType = $body.mod('headertype'), - of course I am getting $body.mod is not a function.  I realize it's not declared anywhere.
[12:49:27] <taplar> i'm just not entirely sure what the assumed functionality of mod() would be
[12:49:27] <mvpgraff> So i have an array of objects - each object has a "goal name", but I want to merge those objects instead of printing each one in the csv if there is any duplicates
[12:50:38] <taplar> mvpgraff: if you want to do some merging, what you might do is go through each one of them and put them in another array.  if it already exists in the other array, do your merge instead of re-adding
[12:51:17] <taplar> though for easy lookup might be better for the other thing to be a map/object where the goal name is the key
[12:52:16] <exactp> I found it
[12:52:41] <exactp> http://pastebin.com/DuCHN2r4
[12:55:30] <ManDay> I thought everything in JSON was a string?!?
[12:55:36] <ManDay> Why does JSON.stringify( { "abcd":123 } )  return
[12:55:43] <ManDay> "{"abcd":123}"
[12:55:49] <taplar> 123 is a number
[12:55:50] <ManDay> Shouldn'T that be "123", rather?
[12:55:59] <ManDay> I thought everything in json is string
[12:56:04] <taplar> nupe
[12:56:08] <ManDay> goddamit
[12:56:41] <mvpgraff> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/x5kukjbg/
[12:56:50] <mvpgraff> thats what my code looks like and where I'm stuck
[12:57:53] <mvpgraff> The rest of it works fine, I'm exporting fine, but I get a result for each goal name even though theres duplicates when I really only need one and then the real results underneath the goal name.
[12:59:21] <ManDay> goddamit, really
[13:01:09] <taplar> mvpgraff: ok, to make sure i understand.  if there are two with the same goal_name, what should happen with the second one
[13:02:11] <mvpgraff> well, it should just not print into a new row in the CSV rather, just make a new row with the results
[13:03:49] <taplar> so skip duplicates?  you said something earlier about merging
[13:04:43] <mvpgraff> well, I only need to skip the duplicate goal name, but merge the rest of the result from the goal name
[13:04:57] <mvpgraff> Let me make a table that explains what I want lol
[13:04:58] <taplar> ah
[13:05:05] <taplar> so like
[13:05:08] <mvpgraff> unless you understood now? :l
[13:05:26] <taplar> name1, result1.1, result 1.2
[13:05:32] <mvpgraff> si
[13:05:37] <taplar> blank, result2.1, result2.2
[13:05:37] <taplar> ?
[13:05:45] <mvpgraff> yea exactly
[13:05:48] <taplar> aaaah
[13:05:59] <taplar> ok, :)
[13:06:24] <taplar> i'll update your fiddle with some pseudocode
[13:07:12] <mvpgraff> taplar: Thank you!!
[13:07:17] <ManDay> you know that point when everything just stops working for unexplainable reasons? most proably somewhen around 10 PM
[13:07:27] <ManDay> like now
[13:07:44] <ManDay> console.log( )  hast just decided to stop working
[13:07:44] <mvpgraff> get a breather!
[13:07:55] <ManDay> it just doesn't output any more
[13:08:03] <mvpgraff> try a different browser!
[13:08:19] <ManDay> il just restart the one i have
[13:08:23] <ManDay> i really hope this is a bug
[13:08:27] <mvpgraff> yesterday I kept messing up my != logic and was placing it in the wrong place and it kept returning blank
[13:08:28] <ManDay> in the browser, that is
[13:11:43] <taplar> mvpgraff: see if this makes much sense http://jsfiddle.net/x5kukjbg/1/
[13:13:21] <ManDay> it's a nightmare
[13:13:30] <ManDay> everything just stopped working. out of nowhere
[13:13:41] <ManDay> my callback for the ajax is simply no longer invoked
[13:13:58] <mvpgraff> check to see if you added a random char into the code
[13:14:16] <ManDay> mvpgraff: ?!
[13:14:20] <ManDay> A "random char"?
[13:14:26] <taplar> anyway, i'm out for the evening, :)  check you guys tomorrow
[13:14:37] <mvpgraff> Thanks taplar! I understand :)
[13:14:59] <mvpgraff> ManDay: like a comma or semicolon out of place.
[13:15:18] <ManDay> mvpgraff: But then I'd at least get errors
[13:15:28] <ManDay> but everything runs smoothly in firebug. except nothing happens
[13:15:53] <mvpgraff> hmmm
[13:15:58] <mvpgraff> got a fiddle?
[13:16:06] <ManDay> $.post( "/?ajax=1&scenario=kitting&order_id="+current_order_id+"&kit_id="+current_kit_id,update_object,function( a,b,c ) { alert( "WTF" ); },"json" );
[13:16:20] <ManDay> I see how firebug makes the damn requests and they all return HTTP 200 OK
[13:16:23] <ManDay> but nothing happens
[13:17:26] <ManDay> Oh there is something
[13:17:36] <ManDay> an error in the response... <br /> <b>Parse error</b>: syntax error, unexpected end of file in <b>/var/www/ltls/localhost/include/ajax.php</b> on line <b>39</b><br />
[13:17:46] <ManDay> but i didn't know that the callback is not called then
[13:18:45] <ManDay> wow, i 'm back in the game
[13:18:58] <sk0al> http://pastie.org/10304846 anyone able tohelp me figure out why my sort function is not working?
[13:19:20] <mvpgraff> Glad I can help ManDay
[13:19:22] <mvpgraff> :D
[13:19:41] <ManDay> mvpgraff: you have given me valuable psychological support indeed
[13:20:07] <PersonX> would anyone like to comment on what they think is the best way to implement a web chat? one where we don't have to save the chats in our db for future reference. just a simple real time chat. I can think of many ways to do that but what I think is the best way is - embed flash in the page which creates a socket to connect to the ip of another user where he too has the same flash waiting for a connection request. and then handling of text could be done by c
[13:20:07] <PersonX> alling js functions from within flash.
[13:22:39] <sk0al> how would I wait for multiple getJSON calls to finish and then put the results into an array?
[13:23:48] <mvpgraff> sk0al create an event handler
[13:24:09] <sk0al> could you point me to some type of an example?
[13:25:48] <ManDay> heh, funny, JS is about the only language where ==true is not redundant
[13:26:55] <mvpgraff> sk0al: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/ it specifies a .done(), don't know if that's what you're looking for exactly but I would check it out
[13:27:41] <sk0al> ok thanks
[13:28:25] <shoky_> sk0al:  var requests = [$.getJSON(..), $.getJSON(..)];   $.when.apply($, requests).done(function(results) { ... })
[13:31:23] <sk0al> shoky_:  Do you have an example of what you just showed me more in full?
[13:31:56] <sk0al> I am using .done but it seems it triggers that after every success ful item. I need to wait until the whole entire query is done
[13:34:12] <sk0al> There we go. think it was .always
[13:46:56] <shoky_> sk0al: http://jsfiddle.net/kzg532qy/
[13:47:44] <sk0al> thanks shoky_ : Let me play with that.

[15:20:04] <LurkAshFlake> is there anything wrong with this very simple code? http://pastebin.com/xGAxeUdb
[15:20:30] <robertmaxrees> you're going to fade every div on the page.
[15:20:47] <LurkAshFlake> yes it's beginner stuff so no #greenBox
[16:25:43] <SmashingX2> hi, does anyone know where can I get help about jquery te wysiwyg?
[16:47:25] <xeegX64> great com
[17:03:09] <YamakasY> I'm getting nuts
[17:03:26] <robertmaxrees> uh oh.
[17:04:26] <YamakasY> I'm trying to find some file upload with simple preregristration like, email
[17:04:40] <YamakasY> just type your email and upload
[17:04:59] <gambl0re> is bourbon and bootstrap similar?
[17:05:02] <YamakasY> no-one seem to have invebted that ?
[17:05:43] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re kind of - bourbon with neat is more like bootstrap.
[17:05:58] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY invented what?  like, a simple file uploader?
[17:06:00] <robertmaxrees> because thos exist.
[17:06:07] <gambl0re> which is better?
[17:06:19] <robertmaxrees> neither - they both have strengths and weaknesses.
[17:06:25] <robertmaxrees> up to you to determine which is better for your project.
[17:06:39] <gambl0re> whats is bourbons strengths over bootstrap
[17:06:49] <gambl0re> and bootstraps strengths over bourbon
[17:06:52] <robertmaxrees> !g bourbon vs bootstrap
[17:06:52] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Why I prefer Bourbon over Bootstrap | Federico Ramírez → http://federicoramirez.name/why-i-prefer-bourbon-over-bootstrap/
[17:06:57] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yes I have seen many, jquery file uploader is a nice one... but as I need it temporary a existing solution would be nice... enter email, drag/drop in your own folder like email_domain_tld or so
[17:07:13] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re kind of OT for this channel and a huge subject on its own.
[17:07:43] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: i don't need all the signup woes and download stuff... just, place name/email and upload!
[17:07:46] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY i'm not sure what you mean - are you looking for something that's already live that you just put in your email and it's good to go?
[17:08:16] <gambl0re> what did you have for lunch today? teriyaki?
[17:08:21] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[17:08:26] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yes, but on my own small server, people need to be able to upload photo for me I need to manage into something
[17:08:27] <robertmaxrees> i took my intern team out for pho
[17:08:33] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY then implement that.
[17:08:55] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yes but I'm unsure for with and example... blueimp
[17:09:05] <YamakasY> do I need to use the session, whatever
[17:09:07] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY so become familiar with it.
[17:09:19] <robertmaxrees> there are dozens of guides out there about how file uploads work.
[17:09:32] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yap, googleing them
[17:58:06] <AliG1000> Hi - I am using a file uploader (by Kartik), to upload a file using ajax.  It sends JSON response back to the original page.  All good so far.  How can I use that response to populate a hidden form field in a second form?
[17:58:29] <robertmaxrees> is there a callback?
[17:59:16] <acidjazz> is it possibel to .on 'keyup' a certain div
[17:59:21] <acidjazz> or do i need to $(document)
[18:00:14] <AliG1000> @robertmaxrees.  setup on the original page?   not yet
[18:00:51] <acidjazz> nm figured it out
[18:00:55] <acidjazz> AliG1000: he left you
[18:41:51] <op_> is that true that for game developement, FULL JS is better than jQuery for performances?
[18:47:27] <tw2113> jQuery is a DOM library, for what it's worth
[18:47:51] <tw2113> chances are there are much better js-based things out there for online games
[18:48:30] <tw2113> but, i could be wrong
[19:13:14] <beanHolez> I have a form submit event listener that prevents the default submission, and builds a formData object that is submitted via AJAX. The server responds with a 302 redirect like I want, but the browser is not redirecting, and the success callback gets passed the DOM of the page I am supposed to be redirecting to. Where am I going wrong?

[19:34:00] <giraffestock> Making a jquery UI app-thing, available here http://giraffestock.com/notes/LockBackground.html, and am running into an issue. The button on the left (+) only works correctly the first time, after that its 'bounds' are messed up (you need to click/hover over the top half of it)
[19:34:51] <giraffestock> any ideas on what the issue is?
[19:37:01] <ISmithers> Hi all
[19:37:25] <ISmithers> I've been doing some sites that use more and more jquery animation stuff. I usually find that my bottleneck here (in terms of development time) is connecting these animations.
[19:37:46] <ISmithers> ie Saying that when this H3 is clicked to animate like an accordion, it closes all the other H3 accordions. Those kind of connections etc.
[19:38:42] <ISmithers> Is it sensible to write some closures that let you pass through these kind of connections to eliminate the manual labour in coding them every time?
[19:57:15] <AliG1000> How do I add a callback function to this?
[19:57:16] <AliG1000> $(document).on("ready", function() {    $("#images").fileinput({        uploadAsync: false,        uploadUrl: "upload.php"    });});

[21:55:28] <AcidBeard> Hey guys, in this extension I am making, how would I geth what selector was used to call the function? http://jsfiddle.net/bsnsyca6/
[21:57:26] <Uhkis> AcidBeard: this
[21:58:43] <AcidBeard> Oh, ok, this.selector?
[21:58:59] <Uhkis> that's the string, yes
[21:59:07] <AcidBeard> Awesome, thanks
[22:00:06] <funfunctor> Hi
[22:01:07] <funfunctor> I am writing a applet that reports back a string and I get back this http://lpaste.net/137067  how on the HTML side do I handle this?
[22:28:02] <AcidBeard> funfunctor: eval() it
[22:28:22] <AcidBeard> That will run the javascript
[22:28:56] <funfunctor> AcidBeard: well my site is written in Haskell so I guess that makes thing a little more confusing
[22:29:16] <funfunctor> upon the POST of my form, it replies with a new page that contains that
[22:29:40] <funfunctor> probably wrapped in a PUT
[22:29:49] <funfunctor> I *think*
[22:30:57] <funfunctor> AcidBeard: yea it is in the form response
[22:31:21] <funfunctor> so I am a little confused on the client side how I actually catch that and handle it?
[22:33:24] <AcidBeard> Can you show me what you working on?  Maybe I can help more.
[22:33:37] <AcidBeard> Like a link or something
[22:34:24] <funfunctor> AcidBeard: sure thing! So this is the library https://hackage.haskell.org/package/snap-extras-0.11/docs/Snap-Extras-Ajax.html
[22:35:49] <funfunctor> AcidBeard: this is the url handler http://lpaste.net/2526374414333771776
[22:37:02] <funfunctor> AcidBeard: on line 10 (the Nothing branch) is handles the GET to render the form and line 5 (the Just branch) handles the returned POST of the form
[22:37:44] <funfunctor> AcidBeard: where (Just x) has the value of the POST inside x
[22:37:55] <funfunctor> automatically made type-safe
[22:38:15] <funfunctor> Hopefully that gives some context?
[22:38:32] <AcidBeard> That return looks like it contains everything it needs, did you try doing a javascript eval on the reponse?
[22:38:56] <AcidBeard> Yeah, it helped, but looking at everything, it seems like it is updating one area of the page
[22:39:03] <AcidBeard> And the reponse contains a selector
[22:40:03] <funfunctor> AcidBeard: yea I wanted to show the calculated response beside the form basically (not worrying about looks for the moment..)
[22:40:50] <funfunctor> I can see the thing that comes back to the browser looks like valid js but why is it showing up in a new page?
[22:41:13] <AcidBeard> What does your ajax look like?
[22:41:19] <AcidBeard> Well, your js file?
[22:45:09] <funfunctor> AcidBeard: I tried to put <script>$("#res").html()</script>  <p>Hello World</p>
[22:45:16] <funfunctor> but it didn't do anything
[22:45:44] <funfunctor> P.S. I normally write compilers, do hardware design etc.. so not really a web dev..
[22:46:30] <AcidBeard> You need to stop the form from posting via page request and make it post with AJAX
[22:48:28] <AcidBeard> Then you eval the response
[22:50:13] <funfunctor> AcidBeard: sorry, I am not sure how to do that?
[22:51:14] <SomBanil> Hi
[22:51:44] <funfunctor> AcidBeard: flicing though http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/create-ajax-contact-form now
[22:51:52] <SomBanil> I am facing an issue regarding jQuery UI dialog
[22:52:53] <AcidBeard> SomBanil: If at all possible put it in JSFiddle, but what's the issue?
[22:54:27] <SomBanil> AcidBeard: I am extended UI dialog's create() method . I want to call that create() method once again in same dialog.
[22:57:26] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[23:03:45] <stns> Hi, I'm using jquery validator to validate an email input field. It shows a neat little message if the input is invalid. So far so good. I'd like to check if this field has a valid value or not when a event outside this form occurs. Could you please tell me what function I'm looking for?
[23:07:03] <AcidBeard> SomBanil: Put it in JSFiddle
[23:07:15] <funfunctor> AcidBeard: ok I wrote the JS, I keep getting this http://lpaste.net/137067 and here is my JS http://lpaste.net/137069
[23:07:55] <funfunctor> AcidBeard: first I believe my JS is not eval on load?
[23:08:13] <SomBanil> AcidBeard: js fiddle link is here: http://jsfiddle.net/SomnathGhadge/nhs46m89/1/
[23:09:35] <SomBanil> AcidBeard: Once clicked on save button, I want to change the button and call the create() method again. Is it possible??
[23:13:13] <AcidBeard> SomBanil What button do you want to change?
[23:18:04] <AcidBeard> SomBanil: What button do you want to change?
[23:31:52] <rkrara> hello everyone I need some help with hybrid app based on jquery mobile
[23:32:51] <moo0o0o0o0o0o> hello all, anyone active in here right now?
[23:32:53] <rkrara> I want to know how to I enhance the results received on form submit
[23:33:05] <SomBanil> AcidBeard: On success I am going to write this:
[23:33:48] <SomBanil> $( "#dialogContent").dialog("option","buttons",{});
[23:34:33] <moo0o0o0o0o0o> I've got a prebuiltform in a zip file, it seems after submit it triggers a .js file that uses jquery and ajax to perform a GET request. I am trying to grab certain fields from that same form submit and also do a POST to another URL. Any ideas?
[23:37:11] <mooman2121> any of the 647 users in here ?
[23:37:30] <AcidBeard> Nope, we all sleeping
[23:37:34] <rollingWolf> 646 you mean? well now its 647 after woet joined

[23:39:50] <rollingWolf> I dont even know the qeustion so no
[23:39:54] <SomBanil> hey, please look at updated fuddle: http://jsfiddle.net/SomnathGhadge/nhs46m89/1/
[23:40:13] <mooman2121> I've got a prebuiltform in a zip file, it seems after submit it triggers a .js file that uses jquery and ajax to perform a GET request. I am trying to grab certain fields from that same form submit and also do a POST to another URL. Any ideas?
[23:40:27] <mooman2121> thats the Q rollingWolf
[23:41:16] <rollingWolf> mooman2121 I have some ideas but why diont you ask the one who made the form?
[23:41:45] <mooman2121> they are not available, trying to be ambitious
[23:42:26] <mooman2121> been reading "http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/"
[23:42:40] <mooman2121> but no luck so far
