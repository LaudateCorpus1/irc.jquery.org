[03:07:09] <dsdeiz> hi all, is it possible to grab all list items even when nested? need to grab the text from each list item
[03:28:26] <thykka> dsdeiz, like this? https://jsfiddle.net/j8mdohyt/
[09:19:31] <kriptox> hello all i need help I would like to add to a table a column with a ckeckbox field that allows to select all lines or certain lines in jquery and calculates a total from selected lines.
[09:25:49] <thykka> kriptox, what have you tried so far?
[09:51:37] <kriptox> thykka: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/shbj8egm/
[09:56:14] <thykka> looks like you solved it already?
[09:56:45] <thykka> or at least that fiddle seems to be working as advertised
[10:01:16] <kriptox> thykka:  not quite, I have data like this one and I would like to be able to check them all by clicking on the first checkbox or uncheck them or select some lines and have the total corresponding to the selection
[10:01:31] <kriptox> thykka: https://framapic.org/oqXh4EBcYLpO/09mKo3I3oBkN.png
[10:02:46] <thykka> kriptox, IDK what to say.. I tried adding more lines, and the totals seem to get updated fine... http://jsfiddle.net/32f9j4zp/
[10:05:00] <thykka> oh, you want a new checkbox in the header row, that selects all the checkboxes below?
[10:06:10] <thykka> "checkbox field that allows to select all lines" <- doable "..or certain lines" <- not sure what this means, how do you determine which lines to check if there's only one checkbox?
[12:12:12] <omnigoat> question: I'm running $.get(url).then(d => { u = getUrlFromResponseText(d); return $.get(u); }).then(console.log) and I must have misunderstood something drastically because I expect the  console.log to output the response from the second $.get() and not the first. (the same happens if I replace the second then() with done().) just wondering if anyone has anything quick to remark that might point me to the right direction.
[12:12:45] <robertmaxrees> you can't return out of a .then() like that.
[12:13:16] <shoky> should be possible with jquery 3 promises, no?
[12:13:31] <Es0teric> hi i have this https://kopy.io/77rxH and i want to be able to submit to the ajax call when someone submit on #job-search-input within the on click event.. how would i do that?
[12:13:53] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure you can't return out of a .then() like that but maybe i'm wrong.  easy enough to fiddle up.
[12:14:14] <shoky> huh, that's how .then() works though, with regular promises
[12:14:29] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  omnigoat what version of jquery are you using?
[12:14:31] <shoky> if you return a promise,  .then() will resolve with that promise
[12:14:38] <robertmaxrees> oh derp.  you're right.
[12:14:51] <shoky> but the console.log is logging all arguments of the success callback
[12:14:56] <shoky> not the response body
[12:15:14] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you'd bind a listener to that element?
[12:15:19] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric not sure where you're confused.
[12:15:41] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees no i just want to be able to submit the data to the action i provided in the ajax call
[12:15:45] <Es0teric> thats from the input field
[12:15:53] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric so then what's the issue??
[12:16:10] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees its not getting the data from the input field
[12:16:23] <omnigoat> robertmaxrees:  1.6.4 (oops, seems pretty old)
[12:16:28] <robertmaxrees> omnigoat that's way old.
[12:16:30] <omnigoat> didn't even think to check
[12:16:33] <shoky> oops disregard last thing i said, success callback gets the response body obv.
[12:16:36] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric you'd use .val()
[12:16:54] <shoky> omnigoat: jquery promises behaved differently than normal js promises, before jquery 3
[12:17:02] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:17:08] <omnigoat> yes, I noticed (after assuming they're the same)
[12:17:12] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ok so i am using .val() now
[12:17:23] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric so then what's the issue? lol
[12:17:40] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees the issue is that when i try to press enter it wont submit to the ajax call
[12:17:51] <Es0teric> therefore the query is empty eventhough there is a value in it
[12:18:01] <robertmaxrees> wait back way up
[12:18:18] <Es0teric> did you even read the code?
[12:18:23] <robertmaxrees> do you have a form around the markup?
[12:18:27] <Es0teric> no
[12:18:30] <Es0teric> but why would i need to?
[12:18:31] <robertmaxrees> dude you're changing what the question is.
[12:18:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:18:45] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you have a form.
[12:18:59] <robertmaxrees> and if you wrap with with a form element, you can bind to the submit of the form, which would catch this case.
[12:19:08] <robertmaxrees> as well as clicking the submit button
[12:19:17] <omnigoat> shoky, yes (it's outputting all args), but I see the response and can tell it's from the first $.get
[12:20:03] <shoky> omnigoat: yea i was thinking about error callback, not success callback. disregard :p
[12:20:11] <omnigoat> alright :)
[12:20:18] <Es0teric> nvm
[12:20:36] <Es0teric> so if i have a form wrapped around it, i can do something like... on submit, e.preventDefault)
[12:20:37] <Es0teric> ()
[12:20:43] <robertmaxrees> correct
[12:21:04] <Es0teric> so then i would have two ajax calls
[12:21:26] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:21:27] <Es0teric> one for the form submit and one for non-form submissions inside of the .btn on click
[12:21:37] <robertmaxrees> why would you need 2?
[12:21:40] <robertmaxrees> why not combine them into one?
[12:21:42] <Es0teric> dude
[12:21:47] <Es0teric> how do i do that
[12:21:57] <Es0teric> thats my main question
[12:22:06] <robertmaxrees> your question keeps changing broski :)
[12:22:16] <robertmaxrees> originally you were asking how to get the value of an input on click
[12:22:26] <Es0teric> fine look
[12:22:32] <robertmaxrees> lol not sure what exactly you need from us
[12:22:42] <robertmaxrees> land of 1000 specs
[12:23:33] <Es0teric> i have a form and an input field, the input field displays on a button click, i have an ajax call that uses data() to determine what category or tag its in to send over via POST to an ajax action defined... the data from the input field needs to be sent to the ajax call... my question is how do i combine all of that into one call
[12:23:38] <Es0teric> i showed the code
[12:23:47] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees now do you get it?
[12:24:18] <robertmaxrees> now that you've explained it, yes.  so you just need to set an object over ajax.
[12:24:32] <Es0teric> wait what?
[12:24:33] <robertmaxrees> combining data attributes along with an input value?
[12:24:38] <robertmaxrees> *send
[12:24:46] <robertmaxrees> send an object over ajax
[12:25:08] <Es0teric> not following you here
[12:25:15] <Es0teric> how would that work with the code i sent
[12:25:16] <robertmaxrees> where did i lose you?
[12:25:46] <Es0teric> show me where i can do that in the code i sent
[12:26:22] <robertmaxrees> you'd just add it to the query object in your $.ajax() call
[12:26:30] <Es0teric> how?
[12:26:33] <robertmaxrees> var theInputValue = $('#theInput').val();
[12:26:37] <Es0teric> dude
[12:26:43] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:26:49] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to do it for you lol
[12:26:51] <Es0teric> the input field displays AFTER a filter is checked
[12:27:01] <robertmaxrees> lmfao
[12:27:02] <Es0teric> on .btn
[12:27:10] <robertmaxrees> does the input exist?
[12:27:14] <Es0teric> yes
[12:27:18] <robertmaxrees> and what does that have to do with anything?
[12:27:24] <robertmaxrees> you can still select it when you submit the form
[12:27:26] <Es0teric> i am still not following you
[12:27:34] <Es0teric> the input would exist but it wouldnt have any data
[12:27:40] <Es0teric> what use would that object be to add to ajax?
[12:27:41] <robertmaxrees> when the form submits?
[12:27:59] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm still missing context.
[12:28:02] <Es0teric> but then what about the other buttons that depend on ajax not on submit
[12:28:33] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[12:28:33] <Es0teric> i am starting to think that you didnt even see my code
[12:28:40] <robertmaxrees> i'm looking at it right now
[12:28:44] <Es0teric> ok
[12:28:50] <robertmaxrees> your questions keep morphing and your requirements keep changing.
[12:29:02] <Es0teric> ITS THE SAME REQ
[12:29:05] <Es0teric> you keep thinking its different but its not
[12:29:16] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[12:30:46] <Es0teric> -_-
[12:42:44] <NitroLiq> How can I incrementally remove a 'hide' class from an iterated list on click? I have a basic pen that removes it from all of the hidden items. https://codepen.io/anon/pen/bJxzmd?editors=1010
[12:43:16] <robertmaxrees> getting an error on that.
[12:43:43] <robertmaxrees> and what do you mean "incrementally"?  are you going for some kind of visual effect?
[12:43:55] <NitroLiq> https://codepen.io/anon/pen/bJxzmd
[12:44:21] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean each time you hit "add block" just unhide the next one?
[12:44:38] <NitroLiq> Basically, the same effectas if you were cloning an element and reattaching.
[12:44:55] <NitroLiq> yeah, egg-zactly
[12:45:36] <robertmaxrees> i'd do something like $('.meal-request-block.hide').eq(0).removeClass('hide');
[12:45:56] <robertmaxrees> and don't mix/match jquery with raw js.  pick one or the other :)
[12:46:38] <NitroLiq> I usually pick JS.
[12:46:50] <robertmaxrees> then go with that :)
[12:47:24] <NitroLiq> just trying to get it working at this point then refactor later....this is a kludgy solution anyway to a problem
[12:47:35] <robertmaxrees> sure
[13:35:28] <Es0teric> ok so i have this now https://kopy.io/921Af but return false on the on submit event will not prevent the page from refreshing
[13:35:30] <Es0teric> why is that?
[13:37:19] <Es0teric> anyone?
[13:40:35] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[13:41:46] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees who are you talking to ?
[13:41:53] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric yes
[13:42:10] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees actually i have something new
[13:42:18] <Es0teric> how about this https://kopy.io/921Af
[13:42:24] <Es0teric> does it make it even clearer of what i am trying to dop?
[13:42:25] <Es0teric> *do
[13:42:40] <robertmaxrees> i saw your question about the return false not preventing submit.
[13:42:44] <robertmaxrees> is that not what you're asking?
[13:42:46] <Es0teric> yes
[13:42:47] <Es0teric> correct
[13:43:01] <robertmaxrees> so whatcha need now?
[13:43:12] <Es0teric> i am trying to do the same thing i said before
[13:43:29] <Es0teric> i need to submit to the action that i specified with the value from the input field to return data
[13:43:49] <Es0teric> simple as that but i didnt know wether to do it inside of the .btn or on the on('submit') and have two ajax calls
[13:44:10] <robertmaxrees> are the two calls supposed to be two separate actions?
[13:44:12] <robertmaxrees> or a single one?
[13:44:17] <Es0teric> one single action
[13:44:19] <Es0teric> as you can see
[13:44:29] <robertmaxrees> you have two separate ajax calls.
[13:44:33] <robertmaxrees> so no, not as i can see :)
[13:44:36] <Es0teric> so what?
[13:44:39] <Es0teric> they both have the same action
[13:45:01] <robertmaxrees> not helpful.
[13:45:02] <Es0teric> two sepeerate calls for two different events
[13:45:10] <robertmaxrees> i don't know your UI or what you're trying to accomplish.
[13:45:17] <robertmaxrees> so it's hard to provide advice.
[13:45:42] <Es0teric> then dont answer
[13:45:49] <robertmaxrees> welp
[13:45:50] <Es0teric> ill wait for someone else
[13:45:53] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[14:14:34] <Taplar> Es0teric I'm not sure that submit handler is correct.  You've attached it to an input, rather than the form.
[14:14:50] <Es0teric> i already changed it
[14:14:51] <Es0teric> i figured it out
[14:15:01] <Taplar> ah.  awesome! ^_^
[14:15:02] <Es0teric> Taplar
[14:15:25] <Es0teric> i had it right the first time before i pasted the code on kopy and changed it
[14:15:32] <Es0teric> the problem was i have a caching issue with my local env
[14:15:52] <Es0teric> eventhough i turned off xcache, it was still caching and i couldnt see the changes
[14:16:00] <Taplar> you tried the disable cache checkbox on the network tab in developer tools?
[14:16:25] <Taplar> (depending on browser)
[14:17:04] <Es0teric> yep
[14:18:57] <Taplar> small side note.  I see you do the following twice.  $('#post-list').empty().append(data);  You know you could just use html() there, right?
[14:19:15] <Es0teric> ehh
[14:19:27] <Taplar> html() replaces all the contents.  which is what you are effectively doing
[14:26:59] <linux_daemon> hello everyone, has anyone worked with the vmap plugin? i want to concatenate multiple areas but i cant concatenate them ...
[14:27:46] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[14:28:53] <linux_daemon> yep, jsut a sec
[14:29:29] <linux_daemon> https://jsfiddle.net/vq94j8xc/
[14:31:05] <linux_daemon> this is the vector map. i have many areas, and i want to concatenate them in 3 big areas. i tried to work out the logic to get the coordinates, but i get some weird shape
[14:42:24] <linux_daemon> any ideas?
[15:08:11] <MikeD_> why would $.get() return a statusText of "No Transport" ?
[15:10:41] <Taplar> cors maybe?
[15:10:48] <MikeD_> yup
[15:11:02] <MikeD_> i found and tested that theory
[15:11:32] <MikeD_> i guess i should have googled first, but you guys are usually more targeted and the "why" is easier to understand here  :)
[15:27:21] <bestdesign> hello
[15:27:44] <bestdesign> i set a title attribute
[15:27:46] <bestdesign> .prop('title', 'Please try again few minutes later!').
[15:27:55] <bestdesign> how can remove this? to not show anymore?
[15:28:02] <Taplar> prop('title', '')
[15:28:04] <bestdesign> try removeProp but not work
[15:28:17] <bestdesign> hmm good idea
[15:28:27] <bestdesign> Taplar: ^^
[15:30:43] <bestdesign> it seems work in my head :D
[15:31:04] <bestdesign> but then the removeProp what do?
[15:31:27] <Taplar> i would expect removeProp to do the same thing
[15:33:10] <bestdesign> is not
[15:33:27] <bestdesign> .removeProp('title');
[15:33:29] <bestdesign> do nothing
[15:33:37] <bestdesign> the before set title is stay
[15:33:38] <Taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/5fdos8rt/  you actually have to use removeAttr
[15:33:42] <Taplar> as title is an attribute
[15:34:12] <bestdesign> ah really
[15:34:20] <bestdesign> but is fine with set .prop?
[15:34:49] <Taplar> There's some translation there with the prop that it knows that the prop you are trying to set is an attribute, so it sets the attribute
[15:35:33] <Taplar> prop('title', '') doesn't remove it.  It just sets it to an empty string
[15:36:23] <bestdesign> well yeah
[15:36:52] <bestdesign> thank you Taplar
[15:36:58] <Taplar> np
[15:40:08] <MikeD_> does the page have a title configured to begin with?
[15:40:48] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:41:18] <MikeD_> y'know, an old school <title> tag
[15:41:34] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with a title attribute on an elementg? :)
[15:41:59] <MikeD_> i thought he was setting the property on the document
[15:42:36] <Taplar> you wouldn't use jQuery for that
[15:42:45] <Taplar> document.title = 'what evs'
[15:43:53] <MikeD_> yeah, nm ... i don't think i'd ever use a title to tell someone to try again later, so that part seemed weird too
[15:44:01] <robertmaxrees> oh hahaha
[15:56:44] <bestdesign> MikeD_: is  on error text :D
[15:57:04] <Taplar> hmm?
[15:57:20] <bestdesign> have a text we cant send
[15:57:31] <bestdesign> and there set that title attr
[15:57:39] <bestdesign> just not want write long text there
[15:57:44] <Taplar> ohhh, you're talking about your use case
[15:57:53] <bestdesign> yes yes
[16:11:21] <linux_daemon> svg to jvectormap anyone?
[16:11:35] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:11:41] <robertmaxrees> that's not much of a question lol
[16:14:07] <robertmaxrees> linux_daemon whatcha need
[16:14:21] <Taplar> he's holding out for a hero
[16:14:51] <robertmaxrees> lel
[16:15:25] <Taplar> though in all seriousness, linux_daemon is your question jQuery related?
[16:15:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:15:35] <robertmaxrees> where i'm headed with that.
[16:16:51] <linux_daemon> i have a svg of a map, and i need to convert it to vectormap coordinates, to be used in this jvectormap jquery plugin, does anyone know how to convert it?
[16:17:06] <milos_> hello. https://dpaste.de/Dqg2 is my code. But elem is not an clicked element, but rather a function. How can I extract data-id from said clicked element
[16:17:12] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's not really jquery related.  cursory google search says there are tools for it tho linux_daemon
[16:17:37] <Taplar> milos_ elem is actually the event
[16:17:40] <robertmaxrees> milos_ the callback gets passed the event object
[16:17:41] <linux_daemon> i tried them all, no luck
[16:17:49] <robertmaxrees> linux_daemon dunno then :shrug:
[16:18:05] <Taplar> milos_ change elem to e, and use e.target
[16:20:46] * robertmaxrees starts the jeopardy theme
[16:20:53] <Taplar> heh
[16:22:15] <Taplar> I'll take invalid requests for 400
[16:22:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:22:50] * Taplar is proud of the nerd joke
[16:24:01] <robertmaxrees> i always wonder wtf happens to people when they ask questions and then disappear after
[16:24:18] <Taplar> i always imagine office stuff happens
[17:17:46] <z1haze> can you prepend to a form.serialize()?
[17:18:03] <Taplar> it's a string so you can do normal string operations to it
[17:18:21] <z1haze> right but do i have to manually worry about if its a ? vs a &
[17:18:38] <Taplar> there will never be a ? in it
[17:18:43] <Taplar> it's just the query string part
[17:19:02] <z1haze> ok, so if i prepend data to it, i need to add an extra & before the serialize?
[17:19:12] <Taplar> append, and yes
[17:19:27] <z1haze> like `type=${type}&` + $form.serialize()
[17:19:37] <Taplar> oh, sure, you could do that
[17:19:46] <z1haze> did you have another thought on it?
[17:19:56] <Taplar> i was thinking tack it on the end, since order doesn't matter
[17:20:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:20:02] <Taplar> but, hey, order doesn't matter, :)
[17:20:14] <z1haze> actually it does
[17:20:20] <z1haze> thats my issue
[17:20:21] <z1haze> heh
[17:20:23] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:20:24] <Taplar> ?
[17:20:38] <robertmaxrees> oh actually - i have a case just like that.
[17:20:39] <z1haze> the platform we use reads the last parameter as the 'submit action'
[17:20:48] <z1haze> and the submit action has to match something
[17:20:54] <Taplar> weird
[17:20:58] <z1haze> so when i was appending my type at the end it was messing it up
[17:20:59] <z1haze> yeah it sucks
[17:21:07] <robertmaxrees> okay that is strange.  the name of the param should be what matters
[17:21:14] <z1haze> it is
[17:21:19] <z1haze> my mistake, the name is what matters
[17:21:23] <z1haze> but when i had &type at the end
[17:21:26] <z1haze> that wasnt the last one
[17:21:34] <Taplar> So yeah, you can prepend, but if you are going to use template literals i'd say just use them rather than the concat
[17:21:48] <z1haze> good point
[17:22:21] <Taplar> wait
[17:22:25] <Taplar> "that wasn't the last one" ?
[17:22:40] <Taplar> you're not repeating the type key are you?
[17:22:54] <z1haze> no, not repeating
[17:23:06] <robertmaxrees> confused.gif
[17:23:10] <Taplar> ^^^
[17:23:17] <z1haze> i can understand that
[17:23:21] <robertmaxrees> so the name AND position matter?
[17:23:22] <z1haze> its not typical
[17:23:26] <z1haze> correct
[17:23:31] <robertmaxrees> :/
[17:23:41] <robertmaxrees> that's real strange and headache inducing
[17:23:42] <z1haze> so we have an xml file that defines the form structure
[17:23:50] <z1haze> there are 'action' elements that can be submitted to the form
[17:24:01] <z1haze> the last parameter's name as to match that of one of the actions in the form xml
[17:24:27] <Taplar> but other than that, the previous keys can be in any order?
[17:24:35] <z1haze> correct
[17:24:43] <Taplar> yeah, that's smelly as hell
[17:24:49] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:24:56] <z1haze> indeed, but i have no control over that
[17:25:00] <robertmaxrees> i'd almost just spend time fixing that instead hahaha
[17:25:08] <z1haze> heh, we can't
[17:25:10] <robertmaxrees> ?
[17:25:12] <z1haze> its a saas
[17:25:12] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[17:25:21] <robertmaxrees> O.O
[17:25:25] <robertmaxrees> yikes
[17:25:44] <z1haze> think about my back end like node itself
[17:25:51] <z1haze> i can write js to run in node, etc
[17:25:57] <z1haze> but i cant fundamentally change how node works
[17:26:05] <robertmaxrees> sure, still really weird.
[17:26:13] <robertmaxrees> and a bug i'd file and harass the vendor over :)
[17:26:16] <z1haze> yep, salesforce will often be really weird
[17:26:17] <z1haze> ha
[17:26:22] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[17:26:26] <z1haze> and crappy
[17:26:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm in salesforce land these days.
[17:26:31] <robertmaxrees> big pile of nope
[17:26:54] <z1haze> but this didnt resolve my issue anyway
[17:27:09] <z1haze> this stupid think also random will kill a session and return a rediect to home and put absolutely nothing in the logs and you cant debug it
[17:27:33] <z1haze> so you just  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:27:54] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i've been wrestling with the LiveAgent Snap-In.  whole lotta eye rolling.
[17:28:07] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[17:28:08] <robertmaxrees> good times
[17:28:56] <z1haze> yep, and to make things worse nothing is open source so you cant just go on SO or ask the community things
[17:29:40] <z1haze> really having a head scratcher now though.. if nothing is logged and nothing hints as to what is wrong im really at a loss for where to take it next
[17:29:44] <z1haze> to the garbage can
[17:40:23] <milos_> hello. This is, for some reason, not sending file I want to upload
[17:40:24] <milos_> https://dpaste.de/hK0Z
[17:42:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you use formdata for that.
[17:42:59] <robertmaxrees> pass the actual form to FormData()
[17:43:28] <robertmaxrees> var theForm = FormData($('#yourForm').get(0));
[17:45:01] <robertmaxrees> milos_ ^
[17:45:50] <milos_> robertmaxrees, I can't pass the actual form
[17:46:09] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[17:47:09] <milos_> the <form> I'm using is for my profile update, and what I'm writing now, ie document upload, is only going to be used for instantly uploading docs, it doesn't really affect the original form
[17:47:27] <robertmaxrees> why not use a separate form? :)
[17:47:33] <milos_> also, there are many fields in said form, I just can't have them in this request
[17:47:34] <robertmaxrees> either way, .val() doesn't grab file objects.
[17:47:47] <milos_> robertmaxrees, neither will .files[0]
[17:48:04] <robertmaxrees> you'd need formData.append('image', $('#fileInput').get(0).files[0]);
[17:48:20] <robertmaxrees> you need the DOM node before you can use .files[0] :)
[17:49:56] <milos_> robertmaxrees, thanks man, that worked!
[17:51:53] <robertmaxrees> cool
[20:17:39] <Noldorin> Does anyone know the difference between jQuery Promisee's and NodeJS promises? They seem to have different APIs.
[20:48:43] <shoky> Noldorin: node.js promises are just regular JS promises. jquery's promises were very different indeed before jquery 3.0. from 3.0, jquery promises are compatible with regular promises
[20:49:25] <Noldorin> shoky, ah, makes sense. and the extra methods like done, fail, etc. on jQuery promises... they're just "convenience" methods?
[20:49:56] <shoky> Noldorin: yea, or they're just left there for backwards compatibility
[20:50:10] <Noldorin> okay got it. thanks!
[20:50:18] <Noldorin> jQuery docs could definitely be clearer on that... glad I asked.
[23:37:42] <Betal> hello, can someone help here? https://jsfiddle.net/dexutb4m/ want to get the h1 text to print it somewhere
[23:38:36] <robertmaxrees> do what now?
[23:38:47] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean you want to traverse from iamhere to the h1?
[23:38:53] <Betal> yes
[23:39:09] <robertmaxrees> backing up - does that div class="a" always wrap everything consistently like that?
[23:39:19] <robertmaxrees> because there's a pretty easy way to do it if that's the case.
[23:40:04] <robertmaxrees> aaah yeah you're really close.
[23:40:13] <Betal> almost sure yes
[23:40:14] <robertmaxrees> you want .closest(), not .parentsUntil()
[23:40:28] <robertmaxrees> also don't prepend class/id selectors with the tagname.  just use the class/id
[23:40:32] <Betal> this is a example of a real case weirdo html
[23:40:54] <Betal> it is bad to specify the div. ?
[23:41:03] <robertmaxrees> it's unnecessary.
[23:41:12] <robertmaxrees> and can have a (VERY VERY MINOR) performance ding.
[23:41:17] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gpbjdt8y/1/
[23:41:21] <robertmaxrees> just do this and call it a day :)
[23:42:06] <Betal> erm, why closest works and parentsUntil no?
[23:42:54] <robertmaxrees> parentsUntil is getting every ancestor element up to - but not including - the selector you specify.
[23:43:06] <robertmaxrees> you don't want all of those.  you just want the first ancestor that matches your selector.
[23:48:57] <robertmaxrees> :
[23:48:58] <robertmaxrees> )
[23:49:18] <Betal> robertmaxrees: tested on the real case, it works, thanks a lot
[23:49:48] <Betal> was testing even children(".m1") haha
[23:49:55] <robertmaxrees> hah
