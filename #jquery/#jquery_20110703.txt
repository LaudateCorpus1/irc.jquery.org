[00:29:02] <krishna_> from where? are you a programmer?
[00:29:13] <Zerxer> I like to pretend I am
[00:29:27] <krishna_> i don't understand :)
[00:29:45] <Zerxer> I am "good" with php/javascript, yes
[00:29:58] <krishna_> oh
[00:30:04] <krishna_> i am also like you..
[00:30:14] <krishna_> from which country r u?
[00:30:28] <Zerxer> the big old U.S.A.
[00:30:37] <krishna_> oh
[00:30:40] <krishna_> i m from nepal
[00:30:48] <krishna_> nice to meet u in this chat
[00:30:50] <Zerxer> I did not even know that existed
[00:30:52] <Zerxer> :)
[00:31:27] <j_wright> you didn't know nepal existed?
[00:31:53] <krishna_> eys
[00:32:02] <krishna_> it is a beutiful countory
[00:32:10] <Zerxer> so you are a neapolitan
[00:32:16] <krishna_> yes
[00:33:11] <krishna_> what is your facebook username?
[00:33:11] <j_wright> you're from naples, living in nepal, how anagramtastic
[00:33:46] <krishna_> no i m from nepal and i m neplease
[00:33:52] <krishna_> i m not neapolitan
[00:34:00] <j_wright> heh
[00:34:02] <Zerxer> wish I had some ice cream
[00:34:05] <j_wright> me too
[00:34:12] <j_wright> i wish for an ice cream sandwich
[00:34:14] <Zerxer>  must be from this chat
[00:34:50] <krishna_> hehe
[00:34:59] <krishna_> i m also missing icecream
[00:35:30] <j_wright> and 's
[00:35:37] <krishna_> do u use skype?
[00:36:03] <fotoflo> hmm if i put an onclick = "myFunction()" in html, how do i select the parent node of the clicked node?
[00:36:08] <j_wright> never
[00:36:28] <krishna_> myFunction();
[00:37:22] <Zerxer> why is it so hard to figure out how to export saved passwords from zend studio
[00:37:26] <Zerxer> google, you are not being helpful at all
[00:37:35] <j_wright> fotoflo: parentNode?
[00:37:46] <fotoflo> what.parentNode?
[00:37:56] <fotoflo> this  is the window
[00:38:05] <j_wright> this
[00:38:09] <j_wright> it is?
[00:38:24] <Zerxer> fotoflo, pass it. onclick="MyFunction(this);"
[00:38:32] <j_wright> yeah, what Zerxer said
[00:38:42] <Zerxer> then for MyFunction, have an argument in it that you use, named el or something
[00:38:47] <Zerxer> then get parent of el
[00:39:03] <Zerxer> alternatively, use jquery to bind a click event instead of putting it in onclick
[00:39:07] <Zerxer> then this would be whatever was clicked
[00:39:13] <fotoflo> trying that
[00:41:08] <fotoflo> nope, still getting the window object
[00:42:05] <fotoflo> strange
[00:42:36] <Zerxer> fotoflo, what exactly are you doing right now
[00:42:45] <Zerxer> are you doing onclick="MyFunction(this);" ?
[00:42:45] <fotoflo> very simple
[00:42:54] <Zerxer> is that what you just tired
[00:42:55] <Zerxer> tried*
[00:43:14] <fotoflo> function hideBox(){ debugger }
[00:43:38] <fotoflo> <span id = "a" onclick = "hidebox(this)>x</span>
[00:43:52] <fotoflo> in debuger i am typing this
[00:44:02] <Zerxer> ok, now for your first line, you'd change it to something like function hideBox(element){ debugger }
[00:44:03] <fotoflo> typing "this" and getting the window object
[00:44:08] <Zerxer> and then you'd reference element, not this
[00:44:18] <Zerxer> element being a variable name
[00:44:21] <Zerxer> change it to whatever you want
[00:44:43] <Zerxer> but by passing 'this' to it from your onclick, the current value of 'this' gets passed to the function as whatever that argument variable is named
[00:44:50] <fotoflo> ok
[00:44:52] <fotoflo> aha
[00:45:20] <Zerxer> fotoflo: alternatively, you could do onclick="hideBox.call(this)" I believe
[00:45:30] <Zerxer> which should actually set 'this' within the function to what you passed (this)
[00:46:04] <Zerxer> so that it's not referencing the window anymore
[00:46:31] <fotoflo> got it!
[00:46:35] <fotoflo> thanks!
[00:46:52] <fotoflo> function hideBox(element){$(element.parentNode).hide()}
[00:47:21] <Zerxer> good, that works
[00:47:35] <Zerxer> should keep .call() in mind though, handy sometimes
[01:07:45] <_zoggy_> hmm topic is 1 rev behind for both jquery/ui
[01:14:00] <coldhead> good work, _zoggy_
[01:47:20] <Cradam> hello is there a channel for the cycles slideshow?
[01:59:02] <coldhead> i don't think so, Cradam
[01:59:39] <Cradam> :(
[01:59:51] <coldhead> you can ask here!
[02:00:14] <Cradam> well i dont need to ask anything yet
[02:00:28] <coldhead> you just want to hang out with cycle enthusiasts?
[02:00:39] <coldhead> you can start a channel!
[02:01:28] <Northwoods> hi Cradam
[02:02:12] <Cradam> hi
[02:17:08] <cook1es> hey guys why is quoteid undefined on http://jsfiddle.net/AERD4/? what is wrong with my .closest line?
[02:27:04] <coldhead> ?siblings @ cook1es
[02:27:04] <bot-t> cook1es, .siblings([selector]): Get the siblings of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[02:27:13] <coldhead> closest is for parents
[02:37:56] <cook1es> coldhead: thanks! that function probably works better for this, the bottom quickquote returns the first a, any ideas for getting the closest sibling instead? http://jsfiddle.net/AERD4/1/
[02:38:27] <cook1es> oh maybe its as easy as sibling().closest?
[02:39:19] <cook1es> doesnt seem like it :/
[02:40:51] <coldhead> there is no builtin jQuery function to find a nearest sibling
[02:41:21] <coldhead> you would have to write it yourself
[02:42:16] <coldhead> maybe using prevUntil() and nextUntil() and comparing the number of elements returned
[02:43:00] <cook1es> :/
[02:51:08] <coldhead> cook1es: http://jsfiddle.net/AERD4/6/
[02:57:34] <coldhead> cook1es: http://jsfiddle.net/AERD4/7/
[02:57:44] <coldhead> there, you can pretend it's builtin
[02:58:42] <ejo> wait, why isn't .next() or .prev() the same as "getting the closest sibling"
[02:59:02] <coldhead> they each only go in one direction
[02:59:32] <ejo> hmm
[03:00:19] <coldhead> compare prev() with prevUntil() and prevAll()
[03:00:33] <ejo> don't you hate it when you have to drop out of jquery and into javascript? xD
[03:01:08] <coldhead> terrifying
[03:02:41] <cook1es> coldhead thanks! :p
[03:03:08] <Reite> How can I do $(".element").attr("id", +=something) ?
[03:04:33] <coldhead> var id = $('.element').attr('id') + 'somecrap'; $('.element').attr('id', id);
[03:05:27] <Reite> thanks
[03:05:29] <danst> can anyone please tell me what am I doing wrong here http://paste.pocoo.org/show/427734/ < I'm trying to get 100% width from that iframe block and then resize it after pressing 'derp' button
[03:06:15] <coldhead> your mistake might be using an iframe >: |
[03:07:43] <danst> coldhead: <object> didn't seem to work with jquery at all
[03:07:52] <danst> coldhead: any other suggestions?
[03:09:12] <alex88> hi guys, i'm trying to inser into a div an ajaxed document, with replaceWith it removes also the div, with text() it insert text but with i can see tags etc...
[03:09:33] <alex88> what should i use to replace the content of the div with the other html document i got from ajax request?
[03:17:10] <alex88> easier question, if i have to do a fadeout, text, fadein, how can i make that text runs after fadeout?
[03:23:49] <coldhead> alex88: for your first question, use ?html
[03:23:49] <bot-t> alex88, .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[03:24:07] <coldhead> $('div').html('<i>lol</i>')
[03:24:24] <coldhead> for your second, you can generally provide a callback function to do something when the animation completes
[03:24:27] <coldhead> check the docs
[03:24:31] <coldhead> ?fadeout @ alex88
[03:24:32] <bot-t> alex88, .fadeOut([duration], [callback]): Hide the matched elements by fading them to transparent. http://api.jquery.com/fadeOut/
[03:24:52] <coldhead> danst: i am sorry, i have very little experience with objects and iframes
[03:29:17] <alex88> coldhead: callback worked, btw, trying now html()
[03:29:29] <coldhead> good luck!
[03:29:41] <amit_usual> i have been trying an ajax(actually a jsonp) request while on the ajax side it runs the error function i am getting a 200 on the server what could be wrong
[03:30:55] <danst> coldhead: I think that thing should work for both divs and iframes
[03:31:51] <alex88> coldhead: thank you very much, worked fine! :)
[03:32:32] <alex88> last one, i'm using .ajax to get a file, it's all in a folder working in local, firefox works, but chrome gives in console "Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin."
[03:34:28] <JKarsrud> yes, chrome sucks on local ajax stuff
[03:34:45] <alex88> JKarsrud: yup seems so
[03:34:55] <coldhead> good luck, friends, i need to watch airplane! (1980)
[03:35:05] <alex88> and i've read it sucks also in ie
[03:35:17] <alex88> good watching coldhead
[03:35:32] <Diverdude> hello, how do i select an item in a dropdown box with jquery? I tried this: jQuery('#selectbox 25').attr('selected', 'selected');  but it did not work
[03:35:42] <Diverdude> where 25 is the value
[03:35:46] <Diverdude> to be selected
[03:36:00] <JKarsrud> alex88: if you have a local webserver, you could just do it through that one, then chrome should have no issues
[03:36:29] <alex88> JKarsrud: i've not, i've to send the folder to a friend, well, i'll say her that she need firefox :)
[03:36:42] <JKarsrud> oh, ok
[03:38:42] <alex88> Diverdude: http://www.techiegyan.com/2008/07/26/jquery-handling-html-select/ have a look there
[03:39:23] <JKarsrud> Diverdude: use .val()
[03:39:30] <Diverdude> yeah k
[03:39:31] <Diverdude> thx
[03:43:11] <JKarsrud> no problem

[04:34:51] <Toben> Huh?
[04:34:57] <oDesk> what to do when you load data into DIV and find it login form ? how to redirect the parent page to the login form instead of having it loaded into the DIV
[04:35:09] <Toben> uhh no idea
[04:35:52] <oDesk> i checked the response $(data).is("#login")  and this return false in all cases although it should return true sometimes when the login form appears
[04:36:24] <oDesk> Toben: or i might examine $(data) Wrong way
[04:40:22] <Toben> im a noob with jquery
[04:40:28] <Toben> i just came on to find someone
[04:40:37] <Toben> i have no idea what you're saying
[04:41:49] <cook1es__> Can I run $.get(href, function(data){ 	} directly in a onClick attribute?
[04:52:35] <foysal> hi all

[04:53:56] <foysal> how are you??
[04:56:39] <pen> hey
[04:56:44] <pen> no question thanks
[04:58:32] <oDesk> how to hande the 302 xhr status code withing $.post() ? that seems to solve my problem
[05:17:44] <Diverdude> why did you kick him??
[05:18:28] <coldhead> he asked me to
[05:18:38] <Diverdude> why?
[05:18:48] <coldhead> masochist?
[05:19:11] <coldhead> i don't know, people are strange
[05:26:20] <allbad> howdy
[05:29:15] <Diverdude> if i have a reference to a tag, how do i find the first div tag encountered relative from the current reference tag?
[05:29:53] <oDesk> how to hande the 302 xhr status code withing $.post() ? that seems to solve my problem
[05:30:10] <coldhead> depends where the other div is, Diverdude. parent or child or sibling?
[05:30:11] <oDesk> searched on internet and nothing works with me
[05:30:35] <coldhead> parents() or find() or siblings()
[05:30:44] <mehale> If I have a .live('click', going on, whats the best way to check if it contains a ¨checkbox:checked¨ ?
[05:31:09] <dr0id> hi oDesk
[05:31:15] <dr0id> why do people work for so CHEAP ON YOU ?
[05:31:18] <Diverdude> coldhead, its neither, its further down the page
[05:31:31] <dr0id> coldhead: you need to go out often
[05:31:35] <coldhead> mehale: $(this).is(':checked')
[05:31:36] <Diverdude> after some td, tr and table tags
[05:31:39] <dr0id> instead of spending all the time here :P
[05:31:43] <oDesk> dr0id: i'm not oDesk =)
[05:31:50] <dr0id> uggh
[05:31:53] <dr0id> change your nick then
[05:31:59] <coldhead> i was out ALL DAY, dr0id, and it was rubbish
[05:32:08] <dr0id> why was it rubbish, coldhead ?
[05:32:10] <oDesk> dr0id: the nick name is nice to use btw
[05:32:18] <dr0id> yeah, probably
[05:32:20] <coldhead> so bright and all those people
[05:32:24] <dr0id> "Elance" :P
[05:32:28] <dr0id> aah
[05:33:09] <coldhead> Diverdude: elements are arranged in a tree. you should read up on jQuery traversal to see what tools you need to find an element or paste your html and let someone here do it for you
[05:34:12] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/tree-traversal/
[05:34:44] <TeddyMurray> hey oDesk, =]
[05:35:00] <mehale> coldhead: I tried: if ( $(this).children().is(':checked') ) { // but it is always false
[05:35:01] <TeddyMurray> the name definitely makes you stand out ;p
[05:35:57] <coldhead> mehale: maybe if ( $(this).find('checked').length > 0 )
[05:36:02] <mehale> hm
[05:36:07] <coldhead> :checked*
[05:36:30] <mehale> no luck
[05:36:40] <coldhead> show us what you got?
[05:37:05] <coldhead> if you're clicking on the checkbox itself you don't need find() or children()...
[05:37:29] <el_bb> Is anyone using the msDropDown plugin?
[05:37:36] * coldhead needs for sleeping
[05:37:49] <el_bb> This code really looks like a disguised cross site attack: https://github.com/marghoobsuleman/ms-Dropdown/blob/master/msdropdown/js/jquery.dd.js
[05:38:15] <el_bb> But maybe I am just not smart enough
[05:38:50] <mehale> hm, it seems like children is going only one level down

[06:22:36] <TehCodr> How do you get the x and y position of a triggering element?
[06:23:14] <gar_onn> from the event
[06:23:23] <TehCodr> oaky
[06:23:24] <TehCodr> okay*
[06:23:49] <TehCodr> I'm not sure how...
[06:25:09] <TehCodr> how do you get it from the event, though? (<---------jQuery noob)
[06:25:23] <Vorspire> event.pageX event.pageY i think
[06:25:31] <TehCodr> that's for the mouse
[06:25:41] <TehCodr> I'm trying to get the position of a div tag
[06:25:51] <Vorspire> ?position
[06:25:52] <bot-t> .position(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the offset parent. http://api.jquery.com/position/
[06:26:00] <TehCodr> thanks :D
[06:26:07] <Vorspire> ?offset
[06:26:08] <bot-t> .offset(): Get the current coordinates of the first element in the set of matched elements, relative to the document. http://api.jquery.com/offset/
[06:29:38] <TehCodr> now I've run into another problem

[06:30:30] <TehCodr> :D
[06:53:04] <spacegaier> question: I have this HTML element: <input type="image" src="image.jpg" />

[06:53:41] <spacegaier> $(this).attr('src', 'imnage.jpg'); is not working
[06:53:43] <spacegaier> any ideas?
[06:55:41] <TehCodr> is that jerk gone?
[06:56:11] <TehCodr> how do you do two effects in jQuery simultaneously?

[07:17:19] <pen> for string
[07:17:24] <pen> i have a string like this

[07:17:33] <pen> how do I do that
[07:17:40] <pen> or just digits
[07:17:41] <TeddyMurray> oh, use regex
[07:17:45] <pen> as I might have two digits
[07:17:49] <pen> yes, but how?
[07:18:13] <TeddyMurray> well, regex is a different language. #regex --
[07:18:14] <TeddyMurray> http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_obj_regexp.asp
[07:18:31] <TeddyMurray> that's how you use it, but go to #regex to find out what string you need to put in that method

[07:25:35] <pen> interesting
[07:28:00] <pen> odyniec, but what if blah is an variable?

[07:54:18] <nbari> hi all, how can i add a var to a namespace from a function, for example i have this: $.mynamespace = {} and would like to create $.mynamespace.foo = $.ajax.... but foo is obtained from an argument off a function like this function (a,b,foo)
[07:54:43] <nbari> so wondering how could I do someghing like $.mynamespace.+var
[07:54:47] <nbari> any ideas?
[08:02:57] <sean`> nbari, yes
[08:03:13] <sean`> var foo = {}; foo['bar'] = 'baz';
[08:03:19] <sean`> that will do foo.bar = 'baz'
[08:03:28] <nbari> oh ok let me try with the brakets
[08:03:36] <sean`> var foo = {}, bar = 'foo';
[08:03:50] <sean`> foo[bar] = 'baz' will assign baz to foo.foo
[08:04:06] <nbari> oh ok
[08:04:21] <nbari> so the [] interpret the var ?
[08:04:47] <sean`> foo[variable_name_here] is possible yes
[08:06:36] <nbari> sean` thanks got it to work :D
[08:07:33] <sean`> YEAH
[08:21:32] <Cradam> is their a simple script to add content when you hover over an object?
[08:21:52] <nbari> I am trying to stop a function containing an ajax request should i cancell/abort the function of the ajax? currently using something like $.mynamespace.foo.abort() where $.mynamespace.foo = $.ajax .... but not working
[08:22:22] <nbari> i mean it kill the ajax but later the function is called again
[08:23:08] <nbari> I do not know if it is because on the $ajax i have an complete: and there i recall the function again, but wondering if the abort ignores the complete of the ajax

[08:48:10] <Shilon> hello
[08:49:11] <Shilon> is there anyway to use anchors but removing them when showing the url link?
[08:50:48] <smykes24> so i figured out how to disable droppable once one thing is drpped on to it, but how do i re-enable when it is dropped off
[08:50:51] <Jayflux> Cradam hover on what?
[08:51:40] <Shilon> is there anyway to use anchors but removing them when showing the url link?
[08:51:42] <Jayflux> rogy val();
[08:52:06] <Cradam> Jayflux: found the problem
[08:52:59] <Jayflux> Cradam you're using 1.4.2, try using version 1.6.2

[08:54:58] <smykes24> alduro: pretty sure IE 8 doesnt allow indexing of arrays
[08:55:08] <smykes24> there is a way around it but i cant remember how
[08:56:02] <alduro> smykes: even using jQuery ?
[08:56:05] <Cradam> Jayflux: you got the domain for 1.6.2?
[08:56:12] <smykes24> alduro: there is a way around it
[08:56:14] <smykes24> hold on
[08:57:11] <smykes24> alduro: maybe this?
[08:57:12] <smykes24> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[08:57:27] <Jayflux> the same as the one you're using
[08:57:35] <Jayflux> just change 1.4.2 to 1.6.2
[08:58:31] <Vorspire> what object is causing it? if you want to do a success test for a function existing, you can try if(myobject.myfunc){ /*Exists*/ }
[08:58:44] <alduro> smykes24: are you seeing line 5 or 8 ? the error is in line 5
[08:59:21] <alduro> smykes24: sorry perhaps I need to find out a way to iterate over the objects array using inArray ?

[09:06:12] <Cradam> http://31.222.178.89/bprint/public_html/bromsgroveprinting.com/public/ the about button adds content but the others dont
[09:06:34] <smykes24> KevBurnsJr it goes back to the second page that is correct?
[09:08:31] <chero> can anybody help for this? :(
[09:08:51] <smykes24> oh i can probably use dropout
[09:10:31] <smykes24> chero: i am not familiar with what you are doing
[09:11:02] <chero> are you jquery developer smykes24?
[09:11:10] <smykes24> no
[09:11:12] <smykes24> user
[09:11:20] <smykes24> and a bad one at that
[09:11:43] <chero> aha, is there any jquery developer? :)
[09:12:55] <smykes24> doesn't appear to be right now
[09:13:32] <chero> aha....
[09:13:39] <emilianoheyns> Is there a way to cancel a drop between connected sortables when it's ongoing? Based on a function?
[09:15:20] <KevBurnsJr> smykes24: it's supposed to go back to the second page, yes. In chrome it displays a JSON message
[09:15:31] <smykes24> works in safari
[09:16:07] <danieliser> i have a static list of items and am able to drag itemsfrom that list to other sortables using clone but i need to modify the item when it is first dropped. I dont want it to be changed every time its sorted though.. any ideas?
[09:16:08] <KevBurnsJr> I also see it in FFx under some circumstances
[09:16:14] <KevBurnsJr> trying to reproduce it there
[09:17:22] <danieliser> tried a function on the draggable drop event. didnt work.. although if i put the same function on the sortable update event it does work.. but also changes it when i sort them as well.
[09:17:46] <danieliser> also tried the receive event with no success
[09:17:51] <smykes24> danieliser: which i could help you but im also fighting with draggable
[09:17:56] <alduro> Hi there, I have this code https://gist.github.com/1062309 and I'm having an error on IE8 in line 5 Object doesn't not support this property or method. Appreciate any help.
[09:20:10] <danieliser> have 1 other question as well.. i found connect-lists-through-tabs demo on jquery ui and cant seem to get that to work with dragable clones
[09:21:40] <Jayflux> Cradam did you sort your problem
[09:21:51] <Cradam> nope
[09:21:56] <Jayflux> whats up?
[09:22:14] <Cradam> the problem is only the About button is adding more content
[09:23:58] <danieliser> smykes24: any tutorials?
[09:24:11] <smykes24> on draggable/droppable?
[09:24:20] <smykes24> none that I have found besides the documentation :/
[09:25:20] <danieliser> hmm.. trying for a dragable text item from a static list.. when dropped on a sortable list it changes from text to html based on its id
[09:26:04] <danieliser> i have gotten it to change but only when using the update event on the sortable which means it changes the html every time you move it
[09:26:28] <smykes24> im trying to figure out why this doesnt work
[09:26:29] <smykes24> http://pastebin.com/ZZw928pK
[09:27:15] <smykes24> well, why it doesn't work as expected
[09:28:46] <Soothsayer> Anyone using jquery tools overlay?

[09:49:04] <dabear> imthenachoman: huh. you can do pretty much what you want if you use .filter(function(){  })
[09:49:57] <smykes24> Kambfhase: where can i learn about binding functions and what it means
[09:50:14] <malinens> I have <td class="catLeaves"> with many DIVs, like <div class="parent_23"></div>. How to hide all other DIVs that have other class name than "parent_23"? tnx!
[09:50:24] <smykes24> Kambfhase: tring to figure out why this isnt working
[09:50:25] <smykes24> http://pastebin.com/krwpyPDU
[09:51:10] <Kambfhase> why do you redefine a droppable on .cardBlank?
[09:51:49] <smykes24> it didnt work the other way either
[09:52:04] <Kambfhase> whats "the other way"?
[09:52:26] <dabear> malinens: select all the divs, then do .not(".parent_23").hide()
[09:53:01] <smykes24> KevBurnsJr: http://pastebin.com/q6BFmqne
[09:53:02] <malinens> so I need to chain selectors?
[09:53:34] <malinens> $("catLeaves").$("not(".parent_23")").hide()
[09:54:28] <KevBurnsJr> smykes24: wut?
[09:54:48] <KevBurnsJr> smykes24: you mean Kambfhase?
[09:54:53] <smykes24> yeah i did heh
[09:55:08] <versatiletech> malinens: could you jsfiddle.net your HTML?
[09:55:10] <smykes24> Kambfhase:  http://pastebin.com/q6BFmqne
[09:55:14] <versatiletech> or jsbin.com
[09:55:29] <malinens> wait a moment. maybe I'll figure out myself
[09:55:40] <versatiletech> just paste in the HTML in question
[09:56:12] <Krambfhase> smykes24: you are missing a comma on line 6. check you sentax on http://jshint.com/
[09:57:02] <malinens> http://pastebin.com/AaNFqnG5
[09:59:40] <versatiletech> malinens: please include the HTML in question
[10:00:01] <malinens> http://jsbin.com/omaxik/2/edit#preview
[10:00:20] <smykes24> Krambfhase: got the syntax right, still doesnt behave as expected
[10:00:34] <Krambfhase> what do you expect?
[10:01:16] <versatiletech> malinens: now what is the specific behavior that you would like?
[10:01:40] <versatiletech> I came just came in so I don't have much context of your situation
[10:01:41] <smykes24> Krambfhase: when i drag the item off the droppable the droppable accepts elements again
[10:02:19] <malinens> deleted line: $("not(:checked) + span").css("background-color", "yellow");  I want to show only those dics in td->catLeaves with class name: nSelectedParent
[10:02:28] <malinens> DIVs
[10:03:38] <Krambfhase> smykes24: mkay
[10:04:31] <versatiletech> do you have control over the structure of the HTML?
[10:06:00] <malinens> me? yes...
[10:06:06] <Krambfhase> smykes24: a problem might be "rever: invalid" since you cannot remove an item from the droppable without adding it to another droppable.
[10:06:16] <smykes24> ok
[10:06:19] <smykes24> ill remove it and try
[10:06:53] <smykes24> that did it
[10:06:59] <smykes24> of course now I have the revert issue
[10:07:07] <smykes24> but thats less of an issue
[10:07:09] <smykes24> :
[10:07:12] <smykes24> :)
[10:07:13] <dtach> hi, having some trouble creating a Array using a list, http://jsfiddle.net/H2PyL/
[10:07:30] <versatiletech> ok I would rewrite the html so that each block of children is in a nested unordered list
[10:08:00] <versatiletech> that would make it much more clean and easy
[10:08:07] <smykes24> ty Krambfhase
[10:08:25] <Krambfhase> :)
[10:08:49] <smykes24> now to solve the revert issue heh
[10:09:02] <malinens> OK, I'll rewrite HTML and write back.
[10:09:03] <smykes24> actualy not much of an issue
[10:11:58] <Krambfhase> dtach: http://jsfiddle.net/H2PyL/1/
[10:12:00] <versatiletech> malinens: something like this
[10:12:01] <versatiletech> http://jsbin.com/uyiraq/edit
[10:12:41] <dtach> Krambfhase: marvelous thanks a lot! and i'll look into map :)
[10:12:55] <Krambfhase> :)
[10:14:58] <malinens> I need to play with PHP backend first little bit
[10:18:29] <malinens> I will use unordered list for every parent category but I will not show all categories because it's too many- now there are 163 child categories but in future there will be more so I still need to use hide/show
[10:22:26] <versatiletech> malinens: yeah, that absolutely fine. I just wanted to show you what type of structure would make your situation easier. You can add whatever CSS you want to hide portions. There's infinite amounts of possibilities, for instance you could add a scrollbar to the child elements and a little search box on top to quickly find a child element.
[10:23:04] <malinens> thanks for suggestion
[10:32:37] <sprezzatura> n00b question : i have a set of checkboxes each with a different id. now, whenever any of the checkboxes is changed(checked/unchecked), i want the 'name' of that input element and its state - i.e, whether it was checked or unchecked. how do i do this?
[10:32:58] <sprezzatura> am using something like $('.prefsettings').change(function() {            ......        });
[10:33:05] <sprezzatura> but am not sure how to access the elements.
[10:33:07] <sprezzatura> help pl.
[10:35:37] <malinens> $(':radio').change()?
[10:35:51] <dabear> sprezzatura: $(".prefsettings").delegate("input:checkbox", "change", function(){  this is the element} )
[10:36:04] <malinens> oops :D
[10:36:11] <sprezzatura> dabear: let me try
[10:36:27] <malinens>  /facepalm
[10:37:24] <sprezzatura> dabear: $(".prefsettings").delegate("input:checkbox", "change", function(){alert(this);} );  i dont see the alert.
[10:42:42] <dabear> sprezzatura: http://jsfiddle.net/snJ3N/
[10:42:52] <sprezzatura> dabear: $(".prefsettings").click(function(){alert(this.name);  }); worked
[10:44:03] <sprezzatura> both works. which is better?
[10:45:04] <Solow> Okay I have this problem. If I move my div up with jquery, the min-height: 100%; doesnt get recalculated or something.. And the content just moves up, leaving this ugly space on the bottom. Now if I hover my suckerfish menu, being inside of the content, suddenly the height adjusts the way it should...
[10:45:22] <Solow> Is there some sort of forced re-calculate (redraw I should say) I'm unaware of?
[10:47:21] <sprezzatura> dabear: how do i get the state of the checkbox there?
[10:47:44] <dabear> this.name
[10:48:10] <sprezzatura> that would give the name..isnt it?
[10:48:21] <dabear> define state
[10:48:31] <dabear> this.checked
[10:48:33] <dabear> maybe
[10:49:27] <sprezzatura> dabear: got it. this.checked
[10:49:50] <error4o4> hi,  isArray()  doesnt seem to work correctly in Chrome..  jQuery.isArray(jQuery(".post")); returns false also if its an array, any idea?
[10:51:03] <Famic> error4o4: $.isArray() returns a Boolean indicating whether the object is a JavaScript array (not an array-like object, such as a jQuery object).
[10:51:10] <djQuery> thats becuase its an object not an array

[10:56:32] <guy> I have a small freelance job. http://youtu.be/uwI8QYa3fbg?t=1m14s I need such navigation done using jQuery. Just name USD and time it takes for you to do it in PM.
[10:56:53] <guy> only the big windows moving left and right.
[10:57:14] <guy> no flicking them to top, etc.
[11:03:28] <Solow> $('*').hide().show(); This works to redraw, it just makes things look a bit akward because of it flashing all of the elements
[11:04:10] <djQuery> Solow: hope there aren't too many elements on the screen.
[11:04:21] <Solow> djQuery: But there are.
[11:04:33] <Solow> djQuery: Aint there some... Less intense method?
[11:04:57] <djQuery> Solow: attach to the resize event itself.
[11:05:16] <Solow> djQuery: There's a resize event?
[11:05:19] <djQuery> the create custom triggers and attach them to just the items that need to be rezised
[11:05:27] <djQuery> window.onresize
[11:05:29] <djQuery> ?resize
[11:05:42] <Solow> cool
[11:05:48] <djQuery> .seen bot-t
[11:05:48] <hsbot> bot-t was seen 4 hours, 35 minutes and 37 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Disconnected by services
[11:06:04] <Solow> But resize forces the browser to recalculate anyway, so I could just trigger the event, right?
[11:06:25] <djQuery> posibly
[11:10:19] <Solow> djQuery: $(window).resize(); Doesnt do the trick. Neither does window.onresize();

[11:25:18] <TehCodr> can you bind keyboard events to .bind()?
[11:25:39] <TehCodr> with*
[11:27:05] <StaticShock> does jquery have an event  that fires after "ready"?
[11:27:22] <StaticShock> i'm not sure what's going on, but ready is firing too soon for me
[11:27:34] <StaticShock> before a particular jquery plugin loads
[11:27:50] <djQuery> StaticShock: how are u loading the plugin?>
[11:28:18] <djQuery> you could use getscript('pluginfile.js', function(){hey plugins done});
[11:28:34] <StaticShock> just including it in the footer. i'm not sure why it's behaving the way it is.
[11:28:53] <StaticShock> my jquery is 1.4.2, though, so maybe it's just an old issue
[11:28:53] <min|dvir|us> http://min.dvir.us/ -- click around, then click the back button. Do you see what I see?
[11:29:34] <TehCodr> ?
[11:29:46] <StaticShock> djQuery: good tip. i actually changed my plugin from $(window).plugin() to $(window).bind('plugin') and now it seems to work. is that a reasonable solution?
[11:31:12] <TehCodr> with the function keyDown(), how do I perform a function based on the key that was pressed?
[11:31:13] <djQuery> StaticShock: does it work?
[11:31:26] <djQuery> it is probably just being to slow to load the plugin
[11:31:30] <StaticShock> djQuery: at least in FF it does. haven't tested anywhere else.
[11:32:03] <StaticShock> getScript might not work for me because i don't know the exact path of this script
[11:32:10] <StaticShock> so i'd rather rely on someone else loading it

[11:32:27] <djQuery> StaticShock: you just needt the relative script no the full url
[11:32:55] <StaticShock> i have the filename, but not the path to the script
[11:32:58] <sorush20> min|dvir|us: why I thiught this was a support

[11:33:08] <Zerxer> in Chrome, if I have an iframe in a hidden div, and this iframe loads a page that has an embed object on it, the iframe actually loads awhile and the video starts playing. if I check the contents() of the iframe, I can see the embed. but if I do .find('embed') on it, it's an empty set
[11:33:11] <min|dvir|us> Don't ask to ask; just ask.
[11:33:19] <StaticShock> djQuery: i'm doing this inside of a wordpress page, so it's a bit awkward.
[11:33:20] <Zerxer> which means I can't sendEvent('STOP') or anything
[11:33:26] <Zerxer> this is trange
[11:33:29] <Zerxer> strange*
[11:33:30] <sorush20> why is my script here is not working www.sorushnazari.com
[11:33:47] <min|dvir|us> sorush20: "not working"
[11:33:55] <min|dvir|us> We're not mind readers.
[11:33:57] <djQuery> sorush20: see ?ask
[11:34:22] <djQuery> sorush20: go look up .stop
[11:34:24] <sorush20> min|dvir|us: I want the entire ul to slide down and up as a dropdown menu..
[11:34:32] <Zerxer> bot-t is taking the day off again. no botsnack for him
[11:34:35] <min|dvir|us> sorush20: That should have been your first line in this room. :)
[11:34:49] <min|dvir|us> (Along with a URL, of course.)(
[11:35:13] <StaticShock> is there any way to use $.when here?
[11:35:14] <djQuery> min|dvir|us: a better one would have been my animations dont work here is a link to the site
[11:35:35] <Shilon> hi
[11:35:39] <min|dvir|us> djQuery: My animations don't work, here's a link to the site. http://min.dvir.us/.
[11:35:47] <TehCodr> me needs help but nobody answers my questions :(((
[11:35:47] <min|dvir|us> Now you say: "seems fine to me".
[11:35:54] <min|dvir|us> But that is untrue.
[11:36:00] <Shilon> any way I can remove the anchors on a URL link?
[11:36:06] <sorush20> my animation is partly working but not fully the <li> are being animated rather than ul
[11:36:08] <djQuery> sorush20: you can also save your self some grief and look at ui.menu and ui.menubar
[11:36:25] <min|dvir|us> Shilon: You want the browser not to follow through with <a href>s?
[11:37:06] <Shilon> I #link and on the url it shows www.site.com/#link
[11:37:08] <min|dvir|us> What events do the back and forward buttons trigger?
[11:37:15] <Shilon> i wanna know if I can change it to www.site.com/link
[11:37:19] <Shilon> remove then anchors
[11:37:22] <Shilon> the*
[11:37:22] <TehCodr> min|dvir|us: I'm not exactly sure, but are you calling slideDown with $(document).ready?
[11:37:35] <min|dvir|us> TehCodr: I'm not calling slideDown anywhere.
[11:37:41] <min|dvir|us> I don't even know what that is.
[11:37:51] <min|dvir|us> But I am doing it on document ready, yes.
[11:37:53] <TehCodr> what function do you use to make your bio and other pages slide down?
[11:37:56] <TehCodr> kk
[11:38:10] <min|dvir|us> TehCodr: .animate({'height': 'blahpx'}, 500).
[11:38:18] <TehCodr> hm
[11:38:18] <sorush20> djQuery: I'm looking it up, it seems to be a menu component of jQuery is that right?
[11:38:42] <min|dvir|us> I just need to know what events the back and forward buttons trigger.
[11:39:24] <TehCodr> maybe you should call .animate() at the footer of each page
[11:39:27] <TehCodr> instead of in a js file
[11:40:08] <min|dvir|us> No.
[11:40:24] <min|dvir|us> Does anyone know what events back and forward trigger?
[11:40:44] <Zerxer> never mind about my issue, seems they're using an <object> for this one instead of <embed>. object doesn't have sendEvent? :(
[11:41:28] <TehCodr> http://flowplayer.org/tools/toolbox/history.html -- this uses the back/forward buttons
[11:41:36] <TehCodr> maybe the source could help you
[11:43:31] <sorush20> djQuery: can you help me with the problem until i get myself aquanted with ui.menu?
[11:43:49] <amh345> i have to fieldset classes.  structured like this <select><fieldset class=1><fieldset class=1>   im trying to get the select to show the first fieldset but not the second one.  i tried this.next().show(); on the select value, but it doesnt appear to have an effect.  can anyone help?
[11:43:53] <amh345> two*
[11:45:40] <amh345> i recognize that i could just make 2 fieldsets with different ids.. but i'd really like to figure out this .next() method
[11:45:42] <min|dvir|us> Anyone know anything about bfcache?
[11:51:17] <snover> min|dvir|us: jquery sets an unload handler to fix memory leaks in IE so it doesn’t work
[11:51:37] <min|dvir|us> snover: Interesting, could you explain further?
[11:51:47] <snover> there isn’t really anything else to explain
[11:51:54] <min|dvir|us> I can't set my own unload handler, is what you're saying?
[11:51:55] <snover> that is one of the criteria for bfcache to be disabled
[11:52:36] <min|dvir|us> snover: What I'm really saying is that I don't understand what you said.
[11:52:44] <snover> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Using_Firefox_1.5_caching
[11:53:28] <min|dvir|us> snover: Is pageshow/pagehide cross-browser?
[11:53:31] <djQuery> sorush20: there is not that much to .menu just call it on your existing top level ul
[11:53:49] <guy> I have a small freelance job. http://youtu.be/uwI8QYa3fbg?t=1m14s I need such navigation done using jQuery. Just name USD and time it takes for you to do it in PM. only the big windows moving left and right. no flicking them to top, etc.
[11:54:22] <snover> min|dvir|us: webkit has a page cache also. i don’t know about anyone else.
[11:54:33] <min|dvir|us> snover: IE doesn't have a page cache?
[11:55:00] <snover> I don’t know.
[11:55:38] <min|dvir|us> Are you on Windows?
[11:55:50] <sorush20> djQuery: I really would just like to get the current menu working.
[11:55:59] <amh345> can anyone help with my above question?
[11:56:09] <sorush20> There is £20.00 in it.
[11:56:16] <imsky> $150
[11:56:37] <min|dvir|us> imsky: Is your name Daniel?
[11:56:53] <imsky> that's the second time in my life someone has mistaken me for a daniel
[11:57:05] <min|dvir|us> There is a web developer named Daniel Immke.
[11:57:19] <imsky> no mate, my name is ivan
[11:57:40] <min|dvir|us> imsky: Speak Russian?
[11:57:44] <imsky> да
[11:58:07] <min|dvir|us> Ya tozhe.
[11:58:13] <imsky> класс )
[11:58:20] <min|dvir|us> :)
[11:58:53] <min|dvir|us> All the good developers are Russian, knowhadimean?
[11:59:03] <djQuery> whats the javascript to convert a number to a string?
[11:59:04] <imsky> yeah i see that pattern these days
[11:59:11] <imsky> designers too, min|dvir|us
[11:59:30] <min|dvir|us> imsky: I've never seen a Russian who was bad at his job.
[11:59:31] <imsky> djQuery: .toString
[11:59:49] <djQuery> imsky: parseint
[11:59:58] <min|dvir|us> djQuery: False.
[11:59:59] <imsky> a number...to...a string
[12:00:22] <djQuery> imsky: yeah said that backwards
[12:00:27] <imsky> min|dvir|us: i guess your observation has been proven :P
[12:01:07] <min|dvir|us> I am most assuredly the best developer of all time, thus exemplifying my observational prowess.
[12:01:13] <imsky> hahah
[12:01:21] <imsky> i believe it
[12:02:17] <djQuery> sorush20: if you look up ui.position I think you can knock 90% of the issue out right away.
[12:02:37] <djQuery> sorush20: $('
[12:03:12] <sorush20> djQuery: what is $('?
[12:03:17] <imsky> lol
[12:06:26] <djQuery> sorush20: $('#mymenu').delegte('li', 'mouseenter', function(e){ $(this).children('ul').slideDown().position({my: 'left top', at: 'right top', of: this });}).delegate('li', 'mouseleave', function(){ $(this).find('ul').hide(); });
[12:07:03] <djQuery> oh and that was $('#mymenu').delegate not $('#mymenu').delegte
[12:07:42] <djQuery> sorush20: requires ui.postion http://jqueryui.com/demos/position/
[12:07:52] <djQuery> can I have my 20  now
[12:08:00] <imsky> shoulda signed a contract
[12:08:14] <djQuery> lol
[12:16:35] <sorush20> djQuery: yes you can have the £20.00 if you implement it..
[12:16:45] <imsky> man
[12:16:50] <imsky> crushing the spirit with capital there
[12:17:03] <sorush20> djQuery: not lying
[12:17:09] <windparadise> Hello good mornig, I need you to give me some tips and ideas please
[12:17:20] <windparadise> I am trying to build a collaborative music composition, where each member will contribute to provide an audio / media material that will go in building the music. next a DJ or sound engineer will use his software tools to edit / polish the music till its final touch. the music can be re-uploaded for members review. which at the end will be offered for an aucion or sales... what do you think?
[12:17:35] <imsky> windparadise: i think you need to go to #startups
[12:18:03] <windparadise> where is that?
[12:18:08] <imsky> on this network
[12:18:11] <windparadise> i can't see anything like tha in the cahnnel
[12:18:22] <sorush20> I'm trying to do that myself as I'm really new to jscript and jquery
[12:18:51] <Krambfhase> it's call "JavaScript" not jscript. jscript succks.
[12:20:18] <djQuery> sorush20: 20 aint worth the pain of trying to collect. you should have enough now to impliment yourself.
[12:20:33] <Woet> did someone mention money?!
[12:21:32] <sorush20> Woet: yes. paypal
[12:22:11] <Woet> oh, £20 - that only pays for the time i spent reading your question
[12:22:17] <Woet> but i read your question
[12:22:19] <Woet> can I have my 20 now?
[12:22:22] <sorush20> djQuery: I've included the jQuery UI in the page.. and I've replaced the code in  my script with
[12:22:49] <djQuery> Woet: seeing as I have allready given him the code to do a menu like he is wanting
[12:22:59] <Woet> we should both get 20!
[12:24:27] <sorush20> djQuery: Woet I'm too stupid and only introduced to UI since I entered this chat channel..
[12:24:28] <djQuery> sorush20: but you missed my comment where I told u I misspelled delegate
[12:24:52] <Sieben> Hello everyone
[12:24:55] <djQuery> sorush20: are u familar with jquery?
[12:25:08] <Sieben> Does anyone know how to reopen a dialog box
[12:25:11] <Sieben> ?
[12:25:14] <Woet> sorush20: then it might be a good idea to read the docs or consider a career change
[12:25:15] <Sieben> On jquery ui
[12:25:23] <Sieben> simply
[12:25:25] <djQuery> Sieben: .dialog('show')
[12:25:52] <Sieben> djQuery, does it combine well with a toogle function ?
[12:25:59] <sorush20> Woet: Jesus Christ, I'm either too sensitive or you guys are just slightly on a hight horse
[12:26:05] <Woet> djQuery: are you sure? I believe it's .dialog('open')
[12:26:13] <sorush20> djQuery: thanks so far.. really appreciate it
[12:26:19] <Woet> djQuery: the docs are on my side
[12:26:22] <djQuery> Woet: one of those 2 lol
[12:26:38] <Woet> Sieben: http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#method-open
[12:27:13] <djQuery> Woet: too bad that they dont actualy parse the # on page load
[12:27:15] <Woet> sorush20: people coming here and saying "im too stupid" or "im new here" or "i dont know jquery" are annoying
[12:27:19] <Woet> you could spend that time reading the docs
[12:27:22] <Sieben> how I can combine it with a toogle ? I got a button, each time I click on it I want to show or hide this dialog box
[12:27:23] <Woet> djQuery: i just noticed that
[12:28:00] <djQuery> neither jquery or jqueryui do it. howver jquery could fix it a lot easier
[12:28:13] <insign> jquery has functions for regular expressions?
[12:28:21] <Woet> insign: javascript does.
[12:28:25] <insign> ok
[12:28:28] <Woet> Sieben: combine $(".toggle").click with .dialog('open') and .dialog('close')
[12:28:52] <Woet> Sieben: then try it out, fail, try again, fail again, then paste your code on www.jsfiddle.com and ask again
[12:28:53] <Woet> :)
[12:29:01] <snover> .net
[12:29:07] <Woet> or that
[12:29:17] <sorush20> Woet: we all know where the docs are..
[12:29:17] <Sieben> Woet, I'm going to do that thank you =)
[12:29:23] <Woet> sorush20: okay, go for it
[12:29:28] <djQuery> Woet: I have not failed, I have just found a 1000 different ways that didn't work
[12:29:30] <sorush20> If you don't like the channel just leave..
[12:29:51] <Woet> sorush20: i like the channel.
[12:29:55] <djQuery> sorush20: then were would that put people like u?
[12:30:03] <Woet> djQuery: clueless
[12:30:09] <Woet> probably
[12:30:26] <Woet> then again, he's not even reading your answers
[12:30:28] <Woet> so no difference there
[12:31:06] <insign> http://mootools.net/docs/core/Types/String#String:test
[12:31:26] <insign> jquery makes the dom easy, mootools makes the javascript easy
[12:31:51] <djQuery> insign: whered that come outa the blie from?
[12:32:10] <Woet> insign: you do know .test is a native javascript function?
[12:32:11] <djQuery> oh the regular expression thing earlier
[12:32:54] <Woet> insign: that mootools docs even links to the native javascript function, https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test
[12:32:54] <insign> Woet, y
[12:32:57] <djQuery> Woet: hence the link to this in that doc https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test
[12:33:03] <Woet> beat you to it djQuery
[12:33:04] <Woet> sorry.
[12:33:32] <eros23> c'è qualche supporto italiano? :
[12:33:33] <StaticShock> how can i diagnose why my ready event fires before a plugin loads?
[12:33:34] <eros23> :D
[12:33:37] <Woet> insign: so i'm not sure why you would bring mootools in here :)
[12:33:55] <insign> Woet, but mootools has many functions for string that makes the work fast and easy
[12:34:07] <Woet> insign: i bet lots of them are native javascript functions.
[12:34:26] <insign> is what you think
[12:34:37] <Woet> show me a string function that proves me wrong then :)
[12:35:00] <guy> I have a small freelance job. http://youtu.be/uwI8QYa3fbg?t=1m14s I need such navigation done using jQuery. Just name USD and time it takes for you to do it in PM. only the big windows moving left and right. no flicking them to top, etc.
[12:35:06] <Woet> also, if you prefer mootools, i would recommend you use it - javascripts framework are a personal choice, there is no such thing as better
[12:35:10] <Woet> (even though jquery is better)
[12:35:35] <Woet> StaticShock: show me your ready event
[12:35:44] <ThiefMaster> anyone knows if .prop('src') returns the full url for an <img> in all browsers?
[12:36:14] <djQuery> jquery++
[12:36:18] <Woet> ThiefMaster: try it?
[12:36:25] <Woet> eros23: cosa c'è? - English might be better so more than 0.1% of the channel can help you
[12:37:08] <Woet> ThiefMaster: "all browsers" is relative too, seeing there are about 300 browsers each with hundreds of versions :)
[12:37:08] <snover> String.from -> (anything).toString(); String.uniqueID() -> var uuid = 0; return uuid++; String.test() -> String.match() -or- RegExp.test(); String.contains -> String.indexOf() > -1; String.trim -> String.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, ''); etc etc.
[12:37:10] <djQuery> ThiefMaster: it should be easy enough to test to see if it starts with http to check
[12:37:16] <ThiefMaster> all common browsers
[12:37:42] <Woet> ThiefMaster: make a small test page, install all common browsers and test it
[12:37:43] <ThiefMaster> djQuery: i don't want to test it in my code. i could simply put absolute urls in the src attribute if necessary
[12:37:51] <ThiefMaster> but why do that if the property already contains the full url
[12:38:02] <StaticShock> Woet: http://pastebin.com/Jm8U6Fad
[12:38:03] <Woet> ThiefMaster: it would be better if you explain your actual issue, e.g., why do you need the full url?
[12:38:16] <Woet> ThiefMaster: or, why not make a function that prepends the full URL if the browser fails to do so for you?
[12:38:27] <StaticShock> Woet: ignore the comment in that paste.
[12:38:35] <Cork[home]> ThiefMaster: domelm.src will always return the full url, and as props access those, i would say yes
[12:38:36] <ThiefMaster> Woet: banners. prompt('Use CTRL+C to copy the banner url', $(this).prop('src'))
[12:39:20] <Woet> StaticShock: the $(function(){ fires when the DOM is loaded, that doesn't mean all plugins are fully initialized
[12:39:26] <Woet> it just means their .js file is loaded
[12:39:41] <Woet> StaticShock: probably the plugin has a ready callback too?
[12:39:48] <StaticShock> Woet: ah, i see. hmm..
[12:39:52] <ThiefMaster> and thanks Cork[home]. that's the kind of answer that is useful ;)
[12:40:28] <Cork[home]> ThiefMaster: looking at the dom specs is often really helpful when looking for things like that :)
[12:41:04] <ThiefMaster> i'd do so if i was at work ("wasting" time is not a bad thing in this case :P)
[12:41:11] <ThiefMaster> but at home i like to get my things done quickly ;)
[12:41:27] <sorush20> djQuery: when you mentioned I need to lookup ui.position did you mean in the docs, also is there a separate <script> in the header for the ui.position?
[12:41:50] <Woet> ThiefMaster: still not a guarantee that it would do the exact thing you want it too though, especially in ie6/ie7
[12:41:52] <StaticShock> Woet: the source to the plugin is here: https://raw.github.com/cowboy/jquery-hashchange/v1.3/jquery.ba-hashchange.js
[12:42:02] <ThiefMaster> i don't care about ie6 tbh
[12:42:04] <Woet> ThiefMaster: but i'm sure you will test it sometime in the future :p
[12:42:14] <Woet> ThiefMaster: you said "common browsers" :)
[12:42:25] <ThiefMaster> ie6 isn't that common anymore
[12:42:37] <StaticShock> woet: i guess it's possible that you're right. i'm not seeing anything explicit.
[12:42:44] <Cork[home]> Woet: actually even ie follows that dom spec
[12:42:49] <Woet> Cork[home]: wow!
[12:43:02] <Cork[home]> dom.href and dom.src is all fqdn
[12:43:09] <Cork[home]> *always
[12:43:50] <avalarion> Is someone able to tell me a synonym of preg_match_all from php?
[12:44:43] <Cork[home]> why would you want a synonym for that?
[12:47:13] <avalarion> I need in in JS^^. I don't want to use this in PHP... and I need RegEx in this...
[12:47:22] <Cork[home]> ah
[12:47:38] <Cork[home]> you mean similar function in js :)
[12:48:01] <Sieben> I tried what you suggested with open and close stuff
[12:48:02] <avalarion> thanks -.- not my day
[12:48:12] <Sieben> http://leone.iiens.net/static
[12:48:21] <Sieben> your website was not working
[12:48:38] <Sieben> but my dialog function doens't open up again when I click on the button
[12:48:47] <Cork[home]> ?eval "me here may match many places".match(/(m.)/g)
[12:48:55] <Sieben> The event doesn't seem to be handled
[12:48:55] <Cork[home]> ,,,
[12:49:01] <Cork[home]> the bots gone again...
[12:49:16] <Cork[home]> avalarion: thats what you want anyway
[12:49:54] <avalarion> Cork[home]: is that all?
[12:50:03] <Cork[home]> avalarion: ya
[12:50:08] <eros23> i have a this problem... http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-en/browse_th
[12:50:09] <eros23> http://groups.google.com/group/jquery-en/browse_thread/thread/8e1967f057e3e251/d5cc973ecac2ddf7
[12:50:18] <Cork[home]> avalarion: it will give you an array of all the matches
[12:50:33] <avalarion> that was too easy for my research -.
[12:50:41] <Cork[home]> XD
[12:54:28] <insign> jquery has functions to work with strings?
[12:55:42] <Cork[home]> insign: just a few, but most of the time you just use js natives
[12:56:03] <insign> Cork[home], please, can you same one?
[12:56:05] <min|dvir|us> $(document).bind('pagehide', function() { alert('asdf'); }) doesn't work when I hit back.
[12:56:22] <min|dvir|us> But it does work when I call $(document).trigger('pagehide').
[12:56:58] <Krambfhase> what is 'pagehide' ?
[12:57:05] <Cork[home]> insign: http://api.jquery.com/category/utilities/
[12:57:19] <Cork[home]> insign: for strings i think trim is the only one
[12:57:24] <min|dvir|us> Krambfhase: has to do with bfcache.
[12:57:37] <Krambfhase> mkay
[12:57:58] <min|dvir|us> Why isn't pagehide triggering on back/
[12:57:59] <min|dvir|us> *?
[12:58:49] <lkeijser> i hope this is the right place to ask. I'm using the colorbox plugin for jquery and i want to make the overlay.png look more transparent. Do i have to change the png or can i use css for that?
[12:59:18] <lkeijser> or something else ..
[12:59:58] <Cork[home]> lkeijser: without knowing exactly the styling of the colorbox plugin (never used it)
[13:00:21] <Cork[home]> lkeijser: normally the transparency of the overlays is controlled through css opacity
[13:00:38] <Cork[home]> and i suspect it works the same way here
[13:03:08] <lkeijser> Cork[home]: ah .. i'm blind , it's right there in the documentation; opacity indeed
[13:03:16] <lkeijser> still, thanks for the reply
[13:03:21] <Cork[home]> np :)
[13:04:02] <zec-> I'm using the $.post shortcut for ajax post. It fine posts to the URL, with the data and all that stuff. But instead of returning the JSON string thats send back, it simply declare the HTTP request as "200 OK", and then fires the "error" function?
[13:04:46] <Krambfhase> zec-: please paste your JSON at jsfiddle.net
[13:05:05] <zec-> The returned JSON, or my $.post?
[13:05:12] <Cork[home]> zec-: your json most likly isn't valid
[13:05:20] <Krambfhase> maky
[13:05:25] <Cork[home]> run it through jsonlint
[13:05:28] <zec-> alright, just a moment.
[13:05:51] <Cork[home]> zec-: http://jsonlint.com/
[13:08:11] <zec-> "Valid JSON"
[13:08:37] <Cork[home]> hmm
[13:08:51] <Cork[home]> pb your request then
[13:11:16] <zec-> Cork[home], http://jsfiddle.net/qK3yF/
[13:11:19] <insign> valid json is a pain in the neck
[13:11:37] <Cork[home]> not really
[13:12:01] <Cork[home]> wow...
[13:12:07] <Cork[home]> thats a really simple call too...
[13:12:14] <zec-> ye..
[13:12:19] <Cork[home]> zec-: do you get any errors in the console?
[13:12:36] <zec-> nope.. I've tried to put in the arguments for the .error, but they remain "empty".
[13:13:01] <Cork[home]> zec-: and if you use the old form of error callbacks?
[13:13:11] <zec-> you mean $.ajax?
[13:13:51] <Cork[home]> oh ya, post only support success
[13:13:55] <Cork[home]> zec-: ya
[13:14:02] <zec-> tried that one too.. same :(
[13:14:28] <Cork[home]> zec-: is the content of the json sencetive?
[13:14:39] <zec-> ye.
[13:15:00] <zec-> or.. well kind of.
[13:15:09] <Cork[home]> zec-: if you run $.ajax and request type text
[13:15:15] <Cork[home]> what happens then?
[13:15:58] <zec-> dataType: text right? - Its the same... :(
[13:16:04] <Cork[home]> same...
[13:16:08] <Cork[home]> wtf...
[13:16:46] <Cork[home]> zec-: if you set up a clean test html page, that request a json file from the server
[13:16:53] <Cork[home]> do you get the same effect?
[13:16:59] <Cork[home]> (the json file should be static)
[13:17:03] <zec-> This is a clean test html page..
[13:17:28] <Cork[home]> oh wait a min
[13:17:35] <Cork[home]> zec-: is the call cross domain?
[13:17:40] <zec-> yes, it is.
[13:17:42] <Cork[home]> heh
[13:17:45] <Cork[home]> theres your problem
[13:17:50] <Cork[home]> you need jsonp
[13:18:21] <zec-> hmm.. makes sense, since I'm already using that for my GETs.. but I'm not sure about how to implement it for POST.
[13:18:31] <Cork[home]> you can't
[13:18:35] <Cork[home]> only get
[13:18:52] <TeddyMurray> question-- i have a sortable ul -- how do i get the order of the elements when the user is done sorting?
[13:19:02] <zec-> So I'll have to make my POST request into GET instead
[13:19:03] <Cork[home]> zec-: jsonp uses <script src=""></script> tag hacks
[13:19:04] <zec-> ?
[13:19:16] <Cork[home]> zec-: or proxy them through your own server
[13:19:21] <TeddyMurray> var skill2 = $("#attacking").next("li").attr("skill"); i tried this
[13:19:35] <TeddyMurray> but i think next finds all of the elements
[13:19:59] <Cork[home]> TeddyMurray: index()
[13:20:39] <Cork[home]> it will give you the position of the element compared to the other siblings
[13:20:44] <TeddyMurray> thanks
[13:20:49] <zec-> Cork[home], proxy like making up a (php/c#/.net whatever) script that POST to that URL, and returns the response?
[13:21:02] <Cork[home]> yes
[13:21:12] <TeddyMurray> so if i do $("#attacking").index(0) will give the first element?
[13:21:28] <zec-> damn.. I was hoping I just could make a pure javascript/html based website ;p - mission failed.
[13:21:30] <djQuery> TeddyMurray: .get(0) will do the same
[13:21:38] <TeddyMurray> ah thanks
[13:21:53] <Cork[home]> TeddyMurray: no index is on the li element
[13:21:57] <Cork[home]> to get its position
[13:22:07] <Cork[home]> .eq is what you want
[13:22:12] <djQuery> TeddyMurray: or you may want .eq(0) think .get returns a jquery object not the actual element
[13:22:19] <Cork[home]> TeddyMurray: .get will only give you the dom element
[13:22:37] <TeddyMurray> that's fine, then ill use attr()
[13:22:55] <TeddyMurray> thanks guys
[13:23:07] <Cork[home]> djQuery: its the other way around
[13:23:26] <djQuery> Cork[home]: after seeing you comment I was going to look it up
[13:23:48] <mdpatrick> I'm trying to get a div to slide up from being hidden to show at the bottom of the screen. You'd think it'd be slideup, since it's the opposite of slidedown, but actually it's not... since slideup hide's something.
[13:24:29] <sorush20> my menu is still not working or animating. I'm not even sure I've done things right, I have put a link to the scripts position and ui and jquery latest in my page but the code that djQuery gave me is not kicking in.
[13:24:38] <sorush20> www.sorushnazari.com
[13:32:54] <tippenein> i would not order anything from a site that looked like that
[13:50:54] <ryanneufeld> has anyone combined ui
[13:51:10] <ryanneufeld> ui's draggables/droppables and sortable?
[13:52:30] <sorush20> www.sorushnazari.com the menu is working but not the right way.... I have a long way to go yet.
[13:52:55] <djQuery> ryanneufeld: well sortable allready has droppable built in
[13:53:03] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[13:53:05] <ryanneufeld> I just had that thought
[13:53:16] <ryanneufeld> I just didn't want to use any UL's
[13:53:17] <ryanneufeld> :p
[13:53:21] <ryanneufeld> but I can live with it
[13:53:26] <djQuery> but I have a table that is draggable and the trs are sortable
[13:53:49] <djQuery> and resizable
[13:54:09] <ryanneufeld> http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[13:54:13] <ryanneufeld> that's what I want
[13:54:25] <ryanneufeld> rather http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#connect-lists
[13:54:27] <ryanneufeld> that one
[13:54:39] <djQuery> copy paste?
[13:54:50] <sorush20> djQuery: how much money do would someone like yourself expect to make in the business?
[13:56:21] <Peter`> That's a weird question
[13:56:46] <ryanneufeld> a personal question for sure
[13:57:15] <Peter`> Well, yes, but besides that, would you be able to answer it in your own case?
[13:57:19] <ryanneufeld> hmm
[13:57:25] <ryanneufeld> yes
[13:57:26] <ryanneufeld> I would
[13:57:39] <ryanneufeld> but I won't :p
[13:57:50] <ryanneufeld> djQuery: looks like that's not entirely what I was after :P
[13:57:54] <zec-> Can I use $.post, when the url is a sub-domain of the domain using the $.post ?
[13:58:04] <Peter`> It depends so much on what you do, where you do it, how long you do it, etcetera
[13:58:20] <ryanneufeld> Peter`: it also depends on the market in your area
[13:58:22] <Peter`> "The business" is pretty much undefined in the question
[13:58:31] <ryanneufeld> if i was in the phillipines I'd expect to make much less
[13:58:39] <ryanneufeld> for the same work load/responsibilities
[14:00:31] <djQuery> damn ui.position anyone want to tell me what I am doing wrong here? http://jsbin.com/oviqeh/edit
[14:01:26] <ryanneufeld> http://imgur.com/qwb9x
[14:01:27] <ryanneufeld> lol
[14:05:10] <Cork[home]> zec-: yes
[14:09:18] <zec-> I guess it still makes sense to do all GET/POST at client side then..
[14:13:26] <uptownben> Hey all
[14:15:08] <uptownben> Got a JQuery / JSON question, my server side script (PHP) expect some "raw" JSON to come across the line (application/json)... but when I use $.ajax(), I keep seeing my JSON data and a referrer string...
[14:16:25] <uptownben> Looks like this when it gets to the server: {'nick':"ben"}, referer: http://mysite.com/test/
[14:19:40] <uptownben> How can I send "raw" application/json to my web service using JQuery?
[14:21:36] <unclemantis> how do you guys work out the local date and server UTC date issue?
[14:24:11] <moo-_-> is there a form submit event where I can run some code to convert <input> values to hidden JSON data?
[14:24:15] <moo-_-> like on form submit...?
[14:24:31] <moo-_-> or is there caveats there? (browser wouldn't allow for some reason)
[14:24:47] <uptownben> onsubmit ?
[14:25:12] <uptownben> onsubmit="return yourJSFunction();"
[14:27:42] <moo-_-> uptownben: thx
[14:27:51] <uptownben> np

[14:31:07] <blez> how to get .text() of only the selected element, not all child
[14:31:54] <imsky> wat
[14:32:31] <Vorspire> ?end @ blez
[14:32:31] <bot-t> blez, .end(): End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[14:33:12] <djQuery> blez:   var x = $('myelement'), children = x('*').detach(), txt = x.text(); x.append(children);
[14:33:20] <djQuery> roundabout
[14:33:46] <imsky> this is some dark magic up in here
[14:33:59] <min|dvir|us> Can I put <script> in any order in <head>?
[14:34:14] <imsky> oh yeah
[14:34:18] <imsky> in fact
[14:34:21] <imsky> put them in random order
[14:34:23] <imsky> on each page :D
[14:34:25] <djQuery> screwed up childen children = x.children().detach()
[14:34:35] <blez> what does that do?
[14:34:40] <min|dvir|us> imsky: Serious question.
[14:34:56] <imsky> min|dvir|us: of course the order of listing affects some stuff, sometimes ;)
[14:35:13] <min|dvir|us> I'm using $(document).ready().
[14:35:13] <blez> aaha
[14:36:03] <sphinxxx> anyone familiar with jqure slideviewer plugin? can't figure out why its rendering weird (3rd thumbnail cutoff, and images overlapping) http://www.nautiandco.com/look
[14:36:36] <sphinxxx> also can't get bullets to disappear
[14:36:36] <djQuery> so no-one wants to smack me up the head with whatever it is I am doing wrong here? http://jsbin.com/uxenub/43/edit

[14:37:34] <blez> djQuery var x = $(e.target);var children = x.children().detach(); var txt = x.text();x.append(children); ?
[14:38:00] <imsky> min|dvir|us: but if you do, any definitions have to be placed before they are used

[14:38:14] <djQuery> blez: give a try
[14:39:33] <djQuery> blez: you can see where I am doing something similar here http://jsbin.com/uxenub/43/edit look at the line with http://jsbin.com/uxenub/43/edit
[14:39:41] <draginx> is there anyway to figure out which word im hovered over within a text field?
[14:39:56] <djQuery> blez: rather the line with $trs = $tbody.children('tr').detach(),
[14:40:52] <uptownben> cant seem to post to my JSON web service using JQuery.. wont send raw application/json
[14:41:02] <blez> I have a paradoxal situation. I want to get the text of the current element where the cursor is located
[14:41:10] <min|dvir|us> http://min.dvir.us/ uses http://min.dvir.us/static/style/blue/open_close.js. Why doesn't $(document).pagehide() get called on back button pressed?
[14:41:21] <blez> but with var txt = $(e.target).text().trim(); it gets the whole text of the webpage if the mouse selects all elements
[14:41:34] <anli__> Can I send a keypress to an input[type=text]?
[14:41:37] <min|dvir|us> Does anyone have any experience with the pagehide event?
[14:41:48] <anli__> I want keydown to be trigged
[14:42:07] <blez> and with: var txt = $(e.target).end().text().trim(); it there is a link in the middle of a sentance, like "Hello [link] world" it gets Hello, then link, then world
[14:42:37] <sphinxxx> djQuery, took out the alerts:)
[14:42:43] <djQuery> anli_: good luck with that
[14:42:48] <sphinxxx> djquery, looked through console but see no errors related to the plugin

[14:44:31] <sphinxxx> djQuery, i used that property on the ul and it didn't take them off
[14:45:04] <sphinxxx> the css file associated with the plugin, also sets style-type to none, and it doesn't seem to be doing anything
[14:45:15] <aggrav8d> hi, jquery.  http://dev.mygardenfootprint.com/welcome/gardening  I click search and get two results.  in IE8 clicking "free view" does nothing and clicking "preview" works.  in FF both work.  Please: why is this happening?
[14:45:40] <djQuery> sphinxxx: did you inspect it with chrome. it will tell you where its is getting it from
[14:45:56] <sphinxxx> nvmind i found it.. still can't figure out why thumbnails are being cutoff though
[14:46:58] <blez> how to get the number of child elements
[14:47:57] <djQuery> sphinxxx: body.custom #main-content ul li
[14:49:43] <sphinxxx> djQuery, ya thx i got that part , but why are thumbnails cut off?
[14:50:12] <min|dvir|us> Is there a hrefChanged event?
[14:50:34] <min|dvir|us> I want to call a function when document.location is changed.

[14:54:13] <imsky> the other alternative is polling ;)
[14:54:58] <imsky> also try https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.onbeforeunload
[14:57:11] <min|dvir|us> onbeforeunload is only recent versions of FF and Chrome, right?
[15:01:03] <glen1> is it possible to add a class to an element that gets clicked?
[15:01:52] <timmywil> min|dvir|us: works everywhere, just a little differently
[15:02:10] <min|dvir|us> timmywil: Could you be more explicit?
[15:02:10] <imsky> min|dvir|us: no, since ie4
[15:02:21] <min|dvir|us> imsky: Seriously?
[15:02:25] <imsky> read the page lol
[15:02:43] <min|dvir|us> imsky: Suck my balls.
[15:02:50] <imsky> o_O
[15:03:01] <sean`> sup imsky
[15:03:05] <imsky> that's a pretty..odd way to talk to someone who's trying to help
[15:03:06] <imsky> sup sean`
[15:03:07] <min|dvir|us> imsky: That's me telling you that you are right.
[15:03:21] <imsky> min|dvir|us: i foresee a lot of HR problems in your future
[15:03:24] <glen1> does anyone know how to add a class to any element that i click on?
[15:03:36] <sean`> glen1, addClass
[15:03:39] <glen1> min|dvir|us and imsky lol
[15:03:41] <sean`> in combo with click
[15:03:48] <min|dvir|us> imsky: I sure hope you don't judge everyone based on how they act on IRC. :)
[15:03:52] <sean`> min|dvir|us, behave little kitten
[15:04:01] <min|dvir|us> sean`: Don't tell me what to do. :)
[15:04:09] <imsky> wooooo #jquery drama
[15:04:12] <min|dvir|us> No drama.
[15:04:15] <sean`> where's the <3
[15:04:15] <min|dvir|us> We're all good.
[15:04:17] <min|dvir|us> Right imsky?
[15:04:22] <imsky> i think so
[15:04:23] <glen1> sean`, i know how to do that for a <p> but what happens if it is a <h2> or <h1>. thats the part im stuck on
[15:04:27] <min|dvir|us> :)
[15:04:30] <sean`> glen1, doesn't matter
[15:04:39] <sean`> Every element works the same that way
[15:04:40] <imsky> yeah mon
[15:04:47] <imsky> you can even add a class to <html>
[15:05:14] <min|dvir|us> You know what sucks about that? <html> is actually rendered in some browsers.
[15:05:30] <imsky> wat
[15:05:31] <min|dvir|us> <html style="background: #000;"> works on some browsers.
[15:05:37] <sphinxxx> djQuery, any ide on that overlapping?
[15:05:40] <sphinxxx> idea*
[15:05:40] <imsky> yeah it definitely does lol
[15:05:43] <imsky> in a lot of them
[15:05:51] <min|dvir|us> Shame.
[15:05:57] <glen1> sean`, http://pastebin.com/6k1ZjpPW
[15:05:59] <imsky> o danny boy
[15:06:02] <imsky> the pipes, the pipes
[15:06:16] <RoosterJuice_> i'm having 2 scripts that are conflicting with each other... I'm trying to use the no_conflict, but it doesn't seem to be doing anything... any ideas?
[15:06:28] <imsky> RoosterJuice: apply some juice
[15:06:30] <glen1> sean`, is that what your talking about? cause it only adds the class to the body and not the element i clicked
[15:06:31] <imsky> $.roosterJuice();
[15:06:44] <sean`> glen1, true, because your selector is body
[15:06:49] <sean`> You could try "event.target"
[15:07:09] <imsky> ooh good thinking
[15:07:09] <glen1> sean`, thats why i love you. it works fine now
[15:07:21] <sean`> glen1, it's not adviced to do that though
[15:07:29] <sean`> You should check out delegate and live
[15:07:31] <RoosterJuice_> would someone mind having a look?
[15:07:36] <glen1> thar be demons?
[15:07:36] <sean`> preferably delegate

[15:07:43] <bot-t> glen1, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/

[15:07:48] <RoosterJuice_> http://s.roxley.com/
[15:08:01] <glen1> ill have a look
[15:09:00] <RoosterJuice_> glen1, basically the jquery tools slider
[15:09:04] <RoosterJuice_> and the aloha editor
[15:13:07] <min|dvir|us> Is there a way to tell if I manually triggered an event?
[15:14:07] <glen1> sean`, delegate only allows for specific elements(selectors) to be used not multiple ones :(
[15:14:30] <sean`> glen1, *
[15:14:31] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: the best thing to do is pass some extra parameters or attach data to the event object
[15:14:40] <glen1> sean`, again thanks a lot man lol
[15:14:50] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Smart!
[15:15:09] <ajpiano> RoosterJuice_, you don't really need to include your own jQuery, if it's bundled with aloha - just use the one from aloha
[15:15:09] <glen1> what does your name mean min|dvir|us
[15:15:25] <min|dvir|us> Spell it without punctuation.
[15:16:59] <imsky> and if you swap the | for a . you get a website
[15:17:44] <RoosterJuice_> ajpiano, hmm removed it and still not working
[15:18:13] <ajpiano> i didn't think that alone would fix it, just a general reccomendation
[15:18:18] <Edler> hey ajpiano :D
[15:18:20] <ajpiano> also....why are you using noconflict anyway
[15:18:23] <Edler> please can anyone explain to me
[15:18:34] <Edler> what's the difference of having js in head or in body and having css in head or in body
[15:18:35] <Edler> ?
[15:18:44] <imsky> never have css in body
[15:18:49] <imsky> try to have js at the end of body
[15:18:52] <imsky> lesson learnt
[15:18:53] <Edler> okay
[15:18:57] <Edler> i want to understand
[15:19:02] <Edler> what happens if css is in body
[15:19:04] <min|dvir|us> I have js in head...
[15:19:11] <Edler> and why is it better to have js in end of bod
[15:19:24] <Edler> y
[15:19:28] <min|dvir|us> Edler: I put it in head and use $(document).ready().
[15:19:41] <ajpiano> Edler http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html
[15:19:54] <ajpiano> see the part called "Put Scripts at the Bottom"
[15:20:07] <ajpiano> see also http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2010/12/06/evolution-of-script-loading/
[15:20:24] <Edler> what happens if you put js in the head
[15:20:29] <Edler> without document ready
[15:20:34] <imsky> it'll block the loading of everything under it
[15:20:42] <systemfault> Edler: For CSS in head, the reason is simple <link> tag are only valid in <head>
[15:20:44] <imsky> wooo blank page for x seconds
[15:21:01] <ajpiano> Edler, and if you try to work with the dom in head w/o document ready, it will not find the elements and nothing will happen
[15:21:28] <min|dvir|us> Interesting.
[15:21:37] <Edler> if i put
[15:21:40] <Edler> js in hte middle of the body
[15:21:44] <Edler> is it blockin too
[15:21:47] <Edler> the display of hte page
[15:21:48] <Edler> ?
[15:21:59] <ajpiano> it will block everything after it
[15:22:22] <RoosterJuice_> ajpiano, because i'm getting JS errors when i have both plugins on the page simultaneously... doesn' that mean i need no conflict?
[15:22:34] <ajpiano> RoosterJuice_ no.
[15:22:41] <sphinxxx> can't figure out why thumbnail is cut off on right side here, and images are overlapping on the left edge, http://www.nautiandco.com/look
[15:22:43] <ajpiano> noConflict is not "magically solve any and all potential conflicts"
[15:22:55] <ajpiano> it does a very specific thing with respect to control of the $ variable
[15:23:26] <systemfault> Ah :(
[15:23:49] <systemfault> I wanted to try $('wife').noConflict();
[15:24:31] <imsky> you should have tried $("wife","mistress").noConflict();
[15:25:09] <systemfault> Haha :P
[15:26:43] <min|dvir|us> What's the difference between extraParameters and eventData? http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ I know it says it right there but it's not clear to me still.
[15:26:48] <RoosterJuice_> ajpiano, i've taken out all no_conflicts, i would really realyl appreciate it if you had a quick look at the error and let me know where I could start
[15:28:31] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: I'm trying to pass extra parameters through .trigger() but I'm not getting it... Do you think you could lend your wisdom?
[15:28:49] <aggrav8d> hi, jquery.  http://dev.mygardenfootprint.com/welcome/gardening  I click search and get two results.  in IE8 clicking "free view" does nothing and clicking "preview" works.  in FF both work.  Please: why is this not working in IE?
[15:28:54] <jjb123> Hey everyone, I have a quick question I was hoping someone could help me with. Is there a way to make jquery catch all clicks from links of a certain type? For example, this is what I kind of want to do: http://pastebin.com/Ha9iK6Gb
[15:29:22] <min|dvir|us> Actually, nevermind.
[15:29:26] <min|dvir|us> I have a more pressing issue.
[15:29:34] <imsky> LIFE IS FULL OF EM
[15:29:37] <Anticom> hi all
[15:29:42] <imsky> o hello
[15:29:52] <min|dvir|us> I set document.location and Firefox doesn't know what to do with a gtalk: address, so it asks over and over.
[15:29:53] <min|dvir|us> http://min.dvir.us/contact/
[15:30:12] <min|dvir|us> Click on any of those links if you don't have a handler for the link. You'll get DoSed.
[15:30:15] <min|dvir|us> Is there any way around that?
[15:30:17] <Anticom> i'm an absolute newbie to jq and i wondered how to pass data, gathered from a sortable list efficiently back to the server
[15:30:27] <min|dvir|us> Anticom: AJAX.
[15:30:35] <Anticom> sure min|dvir|us
[15:30:39] <imsky> not quite dosed
[15:30:43] <Anticom> but how do i get the order?
[15:30:52] <min|dvir|us> imsky: Does it ask you over and over?
[15:31:00] <min|dvir|us> Anticom: However you send 'em is how the server will receive them.
[15:31:26] <Anticom> but what exactly should i send?
[15:31:30] <min|dvir|us> Anticom: ...
[15:31:32] <Anticom> that's what i'm not getting
[15:31:36] <ajpiano> RoosterJuice_, i think aloha is failing to load because you don't have the jquery cookie plugin included, oddly enough
[15:31:37] <imsky> min|dvir|us: yes, but i can close the tab with my ninja skills
[15:31:42] <Anticom> just as i said, i'm newbie :(
[15:31:42] <min|dvir|us> imsky: Me too.
[15:31:48] <imsky> gtalk is not a protocol known on this system
[15:31:52] <min|dvir|us> Anticom: Send whatever information you want the server to know.
[15:31:52] <ajpiano> Anticom, have you tried teh sortable "serialize" method ?
[15:32:01] <PKKid> ANyone know any cool website stat packages to track visitors in real time?
[15:32:12] <min|dvir|us> imsky: I'm setting document.location only once.
[15:32:12] <Anticom> ajpiano: nope, sounds like a good point to start (=
[15:32:15] <min|dvir|us> Is there any way to fix this?
[15:32:17] <Anticom> thanks
[15:32:18] <PKKid> I just want to play. :)
[15:32:26] <imsky> min|dvir|us: yes, don't use gtalk:
[15:32:33] <min|dvir|us> imsky: That's not a valid solution.
[15:32:36] <gurumelo> PKKid: http://phppink.blogspot.com
[15:32:58] <gurumelo> track visitors in real time
[15:33:05] <imsky> min|dvir|us: can you link me to a page that says "gtalk:" is a valid protocol?
[15:33:09] <PKKid> thanks, looking now. :)
[15:33:19] <ajpiano> PKKid some dudes did one in node for node knockout last year http://2010.nodeknockout.com/teams/speedo
[15:33:46] <TrueColors> This might be very simple... http://flikes.horble.com/ the searchbar textbox is name="searchQuery" my jQuery which is in the code between the head tags
[15:33:47] <TrueColors> is like..
[15:33:51] <TrueColors> if ( $("input[name=searchQuery").val() != "" &&  $("input[name=searchQuery").val() != "Search" ) submit form
[15:33:59] <TrueColors> but it's skipping the if and going straight to the submition of the form?
[15:34:08] <min|dvir|us> imsky: http://www.adamwlewis.com/articles/google-talk-hyperlink
[15:34:19] <chrisalexthomas> hi, I've got a strange problem reoccuring and I can't find the reason
[15:34:29] <chrisalexthomas> I downloaded jquery, uploaded it to my server, I didnt even open the file
[15:34:48] <chrisalexthomas> when I open my website, it says "missing } after property list"
[15:34:50] <imsky> min|dvir|us: well played, my friend. now try your contact page on a system that doesn't have yahoo messenger, google talk, and all the other apps
[15:34:55] <imsky> NEVER-ENDING ALERT SEQUENCE
[15:35:16] <min|dvir|us> imsky: It doesn't work.
[15:35:20] <min|dvir|us> But it should only not work once.
[15:35:32] <min|dvir|us> If I didn't set document.location it would not work exactly once.
[15:35:38] <RoosterJuice_> ajpiano, it's definitely conflicting with jquery tools
[15:35:46] <RoosterJuice_> because when i remove the slider it works perfectly
[15:35:50] <imsky> min|dvir|us: incidentally, comments on that page say "gtalk:" doesn't work
[15:35:57] <imsky> anywho
[15:35:58] <min|dvir|us> imsky: aim: does.
[15:36:01] <min|dvir|us> For sure.
[15:36:04] <imsky> not on this system
[15:36:07] <chrisalexthomas> thats from firebug and firebug is indicating the error happened inside jquery
[15:36:10] <min|dvir|us> But if you don't have the handler program installed, it'll error out.
[15:36:11] <ajpiano> RoosterJuice_, oh balls... jquery tools includes jquery as well
[15:36:13] <ajpiano> super pointless
[15:36:13] <min|dvir|us> No matter what you do.
[15:36:26] <min|dvir|us> I need some way to set document.location exactly once.
[15:36:31] <ajpiano> chrisalexthomas, sounds like you have a syntax error in your script
[15:36:39] <min|dvir|us> I don't want to force document.location to be the location.
[15:36:43] <djQuery> having a little problem here http://jsbin.com/uxenub/44/edit
[15:36:57] <imsky> min|dvir|us: most people don't have the handler programs you got going on there
[15:36:59] <PKKid> ajpiano, Speedo looks cool. :)
[15:37:02] <ajpiano> whassamatta djQuery
[15:37:06] <min|dvir|us> imsky: Again, that doesn't matter.
[15:37:10] <imsky> lololol
[15:37:13] <TrueColors> can anyone help me out with my problem (Stated above)
[15:37:15] <imsky> FAIL CONTACT PAGE
[15:37:24] <imsky> destroys the browser!
[15:37:27] <djQuery> if you re-order one of the trs you will see the error in console.  index is not defined
[15:37:27] <PKKid> Exactly the type of neat toy I was hoping to play with.. :)
[15:37:28] <ajpiano> djQuery, i don't think you can create comment nodes with jQuery
[15:37:31] <min|dvir|us> imsky: Do you not understand that it's not the links?
[15:37:44] <min|dvir|us> If I didn't have JS at all, it wouldn't work exactly once.
[15:37:44] <imsky> hmmm
[15:37:53] <imsky> well you're screwing up with the js there bud
[15:37:56] <min|dvir|us> Turn off JS and try it.
[15:37:58] <min|dvir|us> NO SHIT.
[15:38:08] <min|dvir|us> How do I set the address bar only once?
[15:38:16] <djQuery> ajpiano: if I view the source after the update the comments look like thier in there correctly
[15:38:20] <imsky> i think ye already know the answer to that
[15:38:27] <imsky> good ol' document.location
[15:38:30] <imsky> all praise the .location
[15:38:33] <min|dvir|us> That's what I'm fucking using.
[15:38:40] <min|dvir|us> imsky: You're not very insightful today.
[15:38:44] <ajpiano> oh hum this observable is just.. breaking... i've never used it
[15:38:58] <imsky> min|dvir|us: lol
[15:38:58] <Mrfloyd> after changing the data-theme the new class aren't being applied in jquery mobile
[15:39:01] <Mrfloyd> any idea?
[15:39:18] <min|dvir|us> document.location "forces" the URL.
[15:39:20] <imsky> RAGE HARD
[15:39:21] <min|dvir|us> I don't want "forcing".
[15:39:22] <chrisalexthomas> ajpiano: thats what I thought at first, so obviously the first step is, remove all the other scripts
[15:39:22] <imsky> RAAAAGE
[15:39:22] <djQuery> ajpiano: from the guy that did datalinking and tmpl
[15:39:33] <chrisalexthomas> ajpiano: right now, I'm getting this error, WITH JUST JQUERY being loaded
[15:39:41] <min|dvir|us> I want my question to be answered, imsky. If you'd like to help, sweet. If you're going to repeat what you've been saying, please stop.
[15:39:41] <ajpiano> chrisalexthomas, got a live page?
[15:39:51] <imsky> min|dvir|us: what exactly is your question
[15:39:57] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, i actually never saw your original question either
[15:39:59] <chrisalexthomas> yup, but it's behind a password, read the dialog :P http://clients.antimatter-studios.com/abuenpaso/
[15:40:05] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: http://min.dvir.us/contact/.
[15:40:10] <chrisalexthomas> the dialog will explain you :)
[15:40:16] <min|dvir|us> Try to click on the Google Talk link.
[15:40:17] <imsky> ajpiano: don't click on the links
[15:40:19] <min|dvir|us> You'll get DoSed.
[15:40:22] <imsky> IT'S A TARP
[15:40:29] <min|dvir|us> I'm setting document.location exactly once.
[15:40:32] <imsky> temporary asset reliefs will come your way
[15:40:33] <ajpiano> chrisalexthomas, once i log in, i don't get any errors
[15:40:36] <TrueColors> http://flikes.horble.com/ ... click the search button, it's saying $("input[name=searchQuery").val() is undefined. <input type="text" name="searchQuery" class="srchTxt"...
[15:40:40] <TrueColors> it looks fine for me.
[15:40:46] <TrueColors> so why is it spitting out the ...
[15:40:47] <chrisalexthomas> ajpiano: firebug gives you no errors??
[15:40:47] <TrueColors> OOOH
[15:40:49] <TrueColors> I'm missing a ]
[15:40:56] <chrisalexthomas> ajpiano: I'm getting an error on every page load.....
[15:40:58] <TrueColors> I hate it when you spot something after you paste
[15:41:01] <ajpiano> TrueColors: you should also put quotes around your attribute value in the selector
[15:41:13] <min|dvir|us> TrueColors: You should be happy you spotted it.
[15:41:28] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, if i click that link, i get an external protocol request
[15:41:34] <djQuery> TrueColors: $('input[name="searchQuery"])
[15:41:35] <imsky> THAT NEVER ENDS
[15:41:39] <imsky> bwahahah
[15:41:45] <TrueColors> ah. I have't seen that used before.
[15:41:51] <djQuery> left out the last ' in my correction there
[15:41:54] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Yes. If you don't have the handler program installed, it'll ask you over and over.
[15:42:24] <ajpiano> chrisalexthomas, i am inded not getting errosr
[15:42:28] <ajpiano> make sure you have hard-refereshed your page
[15:42:36] <chrisalexthomas> ajpiano: can I ask you to refresh, once the page is loaded, click one of the left/right arrows on the top page slideshow
[15:42:57] <chrisalexthomas> ajpiano: I'm wondering now, if my crappy ass 3G connection is the reason for this and I've lost half a day because of this piece of shit...
[15:42:59] <ajpiano> chrisalexthomas, it scrolls...
[15:43:12] <chrisalexthomas> F********CCCC*C*C**C*C*C*CIKK!!!!!
[15:43:21] <imsky> lots of rage in #jquery tonight
[15:43:21] <chrisalexthomas> that bites, really, hard
[15:43:31] <spronkey> quick question for you guys, closest to jquery than anything else I guess; if I've got a carousel that onclick on any item loads a large version of it, should I be dynamically loading the large version (~30KB) or is it alright to just include it in the original HTML and fiddle with display: ?
[15:43:35] <min|dvir|us> imsky: You're not helping.
[15:43:41] <min|dvir|us> Or weren't.
[15:43:44] <imsky> lolol
[15:43:46] <min|dvir|us> I can't tell yet.
[15:43:49] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Any ideas?
[15:43:52] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, you could remove the href attribute after the first click or something
[15:44:08] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: That sounds dirty.
[15:44:30] <ajpiano> what else do you propose doing
[15:44:31] <imsky> yes, yes, we're not helping
[15:44:33] <imsky> >_>
[15:44:34] <imsky> <_<
[15:44:37] <min|dvir|us> imsky: No, you.
[15:44:39] <imsky> you're the genius here, mate
[15:44:54] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: I don't know. I just know a clean solution when I see one.
[15:44:56] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, or you could just preventDefault on the event
[15:45:03] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Already tried.
[15:45:08] <min|dvir|us> The event is animation.complete().
[15:45:42] <ajpiano> you need to prevent the default action of a click with a hrefs with nonstandard protocols, is what i assume
[15:45:45] <min|dvir|us> imsky: I have no problem with you. Please try to be useful, for your own posterity's sake.
[15:45:55] <imsky> min|dvir|us: are you threatening me?
[15:46:03] <ajpiano> can you guys please stop quibbling with each other ffs.
[15:46:04] <imsky> i am the great...CORNHOLIO
[15:46:04] <min|dvir|us> OK, I'm going to stop talking to you now.
[15:46:37] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Sorry about that.
[15:47:05] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: I wonder if there's a way to see if a browser will handle a link correctly in Javascript.
[15:47:52] <imsky> ajpiano: check out his $("a") handler: http://min.dvir.us/static/style/blue/open_close.js
[15:49:52] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Any thoughts?
[15:49:58] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, i can't think of an elegant test for that off hand
[15:50:18] <ajpiano> quite frankly i think you're solving a problem that doesn't need to be solved
[15:50:24] <imsky> hahahahahaha
[15:50:28] <imsky> VINDICATION
[15:50:43] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Which is?
[15:51:14] <ajpiano> which is "i have N foreign protocol links and i want to show a maximum of 1 foreign protocol warnings per foreign protoocol type"
[15:51:30] <min|dvir|us> No.
[15:51:32] <min|dvir|us> Per click.
[15:51:44] <ajpiano> how is it happening more than once per click??
[15:51:48] <min|dvir|us> I don't know?!
[15:51:56] <imsky> also IE just craps out and redirects to a 404
[15:52:01] <imsky> though chrome just throws a js error
[15:52:08] <min|dvir|us> imsky: Could you pastebin it?
[15:52:12] <imsky> pastebin what
[15:52:20] <min|dvir|us> The Chrome JS error.
[15:52:28] <imsky> you...don't have chrome?
[15:52:52] <min|dvir|us> Only Firefox and Midori.
[15:53:47] <imsky> min|dvir|us: http://i.imgur.com/WHwfg.png
[15:53:53] <imsky> no console log there
[15:54:00] <imsky> just a good fashioned 404
[15:54:05] <min|dvir|us> Haha.
[15:54:07] <ajpiano> i simply get Failed to load resource in chrome on windows
[15:54:10] <imsky> yeap
[15:54:14] <ajpiano> in adium for mac it pretty much opens all the protocols
[15:54:19] <min|dvir|us> I think I've found a Firefox bug.
[15:54:28] <imsky> well taking over all the A tags
[15:54:32] <imsky> and redefining browser functionality
[15:54:37] <imsky> is a good step towards introducing a bug
[15:54:40] <min|dvir|us> Is the essence of Javascript.
[15:54:45] <imsky> 0_o
[15:55:10] <imsky> мдааааа
[15:55:38] <min|dvir|us> Don't you have better things to do than waste your time on an idiot like me?
[15:55:46] <imsky> yeah i'm doing them!
[15:58:39] <ajpiano> spronkey: depends how many images there are on the page, might be worth putting it off until clicked
[15:58:58] <spronkey> hmm yeah
[15:59:01] <spronkey> there will be around 3
[15:59:06] <spronkey> (big images)
[15:59:25] <spronkey> they'll start loading straight off won't they?
[15:59:29] <ajpiano> hmm, might not be so bad
[15:59:31] <spronkey> (if they're in the HTML)
[15:59:36] <ajpiano> yep
[15:59:52] <min|dvir|us> imsky: I just want you to know that this is in fact a Firefox bug.
[16:00:00] <imsky> min|dvir|us: did you report it as such?
[16:00:04] <min|dvir|us> Not yet.
[16:00:10] <imsky> then what are you telling me for lol
[16:00:11] <min|dvir|us> I would like you to consider what you said to me.
[16:00:20] <min|dvir|us> You could have been more mature.
[16:01:15] <imsky> wait wait
[16:01:40] <min|dvir|us> imsky: That's all. You can be on your way now.
[16:02:00] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, fwiw, window.location is considered to be preferable to document.location
[16:02:10] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: I'll try it; thanks.
[16:02:12] <imsky> "[18:38] min|dvir|us: That's what I'm fucking using."
[16:02:18] <imsky> ^ example of mature behavior, non?
[16:02:22] * imsky wigglezzz
[16:02:40] <atxq> how can i set the value of a select > option?
[16:02:41] <min|dvir|us> OK, you obviously have nothing to learn.
[16:02:50] <imsky> you're like 17
[16:02:56] <imsky> take it easy with all that talk
[16:02:56] <min|dvir|us> Not from me, of course.
[16:03:01] <min|dvir|us> I don't know anything.
[16:03:05] <min|dvir|us> :)
[16:03:26] <min|dvir|us> imsky: I hope you know the right people from which to learn.
[16:03:29] <imsky> i do
[16:03:40] <imsky> they don't put proprietary protocol hyperlinks on their contact page
[16:03:56] <min|dvir|us> imsky: Have you ever been wrong?
[16:04:03] <imsky> min|dvir|us: have you ever admitted being wrong?
[16:04:09] <min|dvir|us> imsky: Yes.
[16:04:15] <min|dvir|us> Now answer my question, please?
[16:04:19] <imsky> as i recall, "Suck my balls." was your way of saying "i'm wrong"
[16:04:30] <imsky> probrem?
[16:04:37] <min|dvir|us> imsky: I admitted it without any duress or pressure.
[16:04:37] <atxq> i want to set the option of a select by $(this).attr("id");
[16:04:39] <min|dvir|us> On my own accord.
[16:04:47] <min|dvir|us> So you wouldn't think I actually wanted you to suck my balls over IRC.
[16:04:49] <imsky> go you, don't lecture others on maturity ;)
[16:05:11] <ajpiano> atxq, you have the 'option' tag as 'this' ?
[16:05:16] <min|dvir|us> imsky: I just want to make the world a better place.
[16:05:21] <min|dvir|us> Your opinion is not fact.
[16:05:24] <min|dvir|us> That's all I want you to know.
[16:05:33] <imsky> min|dvir|us: what was my opinion?
[16:05:41] <ajpiano> holy crap can you guys stop.
[16:05:46] <atxq> no, that would be the id of the item that I want to select
[16:05:51] <min|dvir|us> imsky: That the cause of my problem was an invalid href.
[16:06:00] <imsky> min|dvir|us: i never said that, you imagined it
[16:06:03] <min|dvir|us> Gotcha.
[16:06:10] <imsky> gr8 m8 :)
[16:06:22] <ajpiano> atxq - the id string is the 'value' of the optoin you want selected in some sselectbox?
[16:06:32] <djQuery> atxq: .prop('selected', true)
[16:06:44] <atxq> .prop? thanks
[16:06:52] <djQuery> ?prop
[16:06:53] <bot-t> djQuery, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[16:06:56] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Doesn't fix it. :(
[16:06:57] <imsky> i love prop
[16:06:59] <atxq> let me check and see if prop would work
[16:07:11] <imsky> i also love chair
[16:07:11] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, i didn't think it would, i'm just saying, that it is prefereable
[16:07:26] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: I know. :)
[16:08:01] <atxq> I want select the option from a <select> tags
[16:08:10] <ajpiano> atxq, what is 'this'
[16:08:18] <ajpiano> what type of element
[16:08:35] <ajpiano> or just scroll back up and read my last question to you
[16:08:55] <atxq> $(this) is == to the id name of the item in the select that I want to select
[16:09:15] <ajpiano> 'this' is not an ID, it's a DOM element.
[16:09:22] <ajpiano> in all likelihood...
[16:09:23] <atxq> hope it makes sense what I want to achieve
[16:09:37] <ajpiano> can you paste the html and/or javascript to a pastebin please
[16:09:59] <atxq> yeah, I will create a small example in jsfiddle
[16:10:02] <atxq> one moment
[16:10:05] <ajpiano> stellar
[16:10:38] <djQuery> $('#myoption').find('[value="' + this.id +'"]').prop('selected', true);
[16:11:30] <atxq> let me see if this works
[16:11:37] <ajpiano> that is not a good way to do it
[16:11:52] <Marz> hi, does anyone know why the 'check all' checkbox isn't checking? http://jsfiddle.net/LbgRj/
[16:12:01] <imsky> plus you're missing an option, djQuery
[16:12:19] <ajpiano> he should just be setting the $("#select").val("theValueOfTheOptionHeWantsToSelect");
[16:12:34] <imsky> ?val
[16:12:34] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[16:12:36] <meosweetmeo> how to count an amount of objects in JSON array?
[16:12:37] <imsky> so delicious
[16:12:38] <djQuery> Marz: see ?proporattr
[16:12:39] <bot-t> Marz, jQPropAttr Decision Helper http://which-should-i-use.ossreleasefeed.com/
[16:12:57] <ajpiano> meosweetmeo, if it's an array, it has a length property
[16:13:05] <ajpiano> once you convert it from a string to an array, get the .length
[16:13:11] <djQuery> Marz: never mind ur using 1.5
[16:13:12] <meosweetmeo> nope
[16:13:21] <imsky> meosweetmeo: wut
[16:13:25] <meosweetmeo> i receive an array from server in JSON
[16:13:29] <ajpiano> ... ok
[16:13:45] <meosweetmeo> i write console.log(answer.length)
[16:13:49] <ajpiano> jQuery.parseJSON(jsonstring).length
[16:13:54] <ajpiano> like i said, you have to parse the json
[16:14:02] <ajpiano> if you are using jquery ajax
[16:14:07] <ajpiano> you can use the dataType:"ajax" option
[16:14:09] <ajpiano> and it will do it for you
[16:14:11] <meosweetmeo> hm
[16:15:13] <Marz> i tried prop and $(this).prop('checked',true) does not work
[16:16:12] <the_new_harley> Hi there, I'm trying to animate my menu (for local anchors) and wish to animate all elements that aren't the active one- the problem is that I'm changing the 'activeNav' class on the fly. is there a way to work around this? I'm currently using each(i) to animate them.
[16:16:32] <the_new_harley> hover animations that is.
[16:16:39] <ajpiano> $(".theseThings").not(".activeNav").animate(options);
[16:17:09] <atxq> http://jsfiddle.net/uWMhu/
[16:17:14] <atxq> here is an example
[16:17:18] <the_new_harley> thanks ajpiano, is .not a live function?
[16:17:36] <ajpiano> atxq, you are simply missing #
[16:17:52] <the_new_harley> i.e. will it affect elements that have been given the class 'activeNav' within my jquery file?
[16:17:55] <ajpiano> if you put it in $("#ids").val(...
[16:18:23] <atxq> mispell, adding the # does not select
[16:18:25] <ajpiano> the_new_harley, it's not a "live function" - it will filter the set at the time you call it
[16:18:35] <ajpiano> i could describe what would work better if you showed some more code
[16:18:44] <ajpiano> atxq, works fine for me once i put the #
[16:18:56] <the_new_harley> http://baffleinc.com/
[16:18:58] <atxq> let me check again
[16:19:06] <timmywil> Marz: http://jsfiddle.net/timmywil/LbgRj/1/
[16:19:26] <the_new_harley> at present you can see the hover animations happening
[16:19:39] <the_new_harley> but I'll give .not a go and come back if I'm stuck
[16:19:42] <the_new_harley> thanks bro
[16:19:44] <imsky> the_new_harley: restarting the animation on refresh and not having the links bookmarkable is...a faux pas
[16:19:58] <atxq> ajpiano, sorry...yeah, it does work.
[16:20:01] <Marz> ?checked
[16:20:02] <bot-t> :checked: Matches all elements that are checked. http://api.jquery.com/checked-selector/
[16:20:08] <Marz> ?checkbox
[16:20:09] <bot-t> :checkbox: Selects all elements of type checkbox. http://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/
[16:20:37] <ajpiano> the_new_harley, doing not will work just fine in your situation, but you don't really need the .each anyway
[16:20:40] <the_new_harley> imsky: what's the best way to do the animations only once?
[16:20:52] <the_new_harley> ajpiano: I think .not() will replace it
[16:21:00] <ajpiano> the_new_harley, you could just do $("#nav li a").hover(function() {  $(this).closest("li").whatever();  });
[16:21:26] <ajpiano> the_new_harley, the best thing to do would actually be to alias the set
[16:21:43] <the_new_harley> as in .item1, .item2, etc
[16:22:00] <ajpiano> so you can just do like var anchors = $("#foo li a"); and then in your handler... anchors.not(this).whatever();
[16:22:01] <imsky> the_new_harley: you can store the fact that the page has been loaded into localstorage
[16:22:40] <the_new_harley> oh right
[16:22:58] <the_new_harley> thanks imsky- will look into it
[16:23:03] <imsky> no prob bud
[16:23:26] <imsky> the_new_harley: also look into re-styling the :active style on your links
[16:23:31] <imsky> that outline is a bit unsightly
[16:23:39] <the_new_harley> ajpiano: is var necessary? I've always written my vars with just the name i.e. anchors = ...
[16:23:50] <ajpiano> the_new_harley yes
[16:23:56] <ajpiano> you should not just be making all your variables global
[16:24:34] <the_new_harley> oh is that the difference
[16:24:37] <the_new_harley> shot bro
[16:24:39] <ajpiano> it is
[16:24:41] <ajpiano> :)
[16:26:24] <atxq> does the wildcard work in jquery?
[16:26:31] <imsky> yes
[16:26:37] <imsky> $("*.*") gets you everything
[16:26:54] <imsky> $("ham sandwich") unfortunately gets you nothing :(
[16:26:55] <atxq> what about just *?
[16:26:57] <ohaibbq> $("*") should
[16:27:22] <ajpiano> $("*") will get you everything, but i can't fathom why you'd need that
[16:27:22] <imsky> man $("*") is a sweet selector
[16:27:25] <imsky> grab that <html>
[16:27:27] <imsky> and <head>
[16:27:30] <ajpiano> *the opposite of
[16:28:46] <atxq> so is this valid, $(this).css("border","solid 1 #ddd");
[16:28:58] <bobdobbs> Hi guys. I'm doing something wrong with jq's $.post function, and I'm having trouble figuring out what exactly I'm messing up...
[16:29:03] <imsky> O NOES!
[16:29:49] <Vorspire> oO
[16:29:50] <atxq> so jquery has issues with the css border property?
[16:29:55] <ajpiano> atxq, no
[16:29:57] <ajpiano> your css is invalid
[16:30:00] <ajpiano> 1px solid #ddd
[16:30:10] <ajpiano> you don't even have a unit in that string
[16:30:16] <bobdobbs> I'm trying to post a multidimensional array. It looks like I'm building the array ok. But when I post it, the string being sent is 'undefined'
[16:30:30] <atxq> I ass that inside the .click
[16:30:32] <min|dvir|us> How do I test if a browser handles a certain kind of event?
[16:30:34] <atxq> add*
[16:30:41] <ajpiano> bobdobbs, you can't post that ... you can only post it as stringified JSON
[16:30:54] <bobdobbs> hi aj.
[16:31:03] <atxq> $("*.*").hover(
[16:31:03] <atxq> 			function(){ $(this).css("border","solid 1 #ddd"); },
[16:31:03] <atxq> 			function(){ $(this).css("border","solid 0px #fff"); }
[16:31:03] <bobdobbs> hm....
[16:31:09] <atxq> sorry guys
[16:31:28] <imsky> lol atxq
[16:31:32] <imsky> i was joking about *.*
[16:31:32] <atxq> so basicly this should work, right?
[16:31:37] <ajpiano> no
[16:31:42] <ajpiano> 1px, and then 0
[16:31:43] <atxq> *
[16:31:44] <min|dvir|us> I'd like to know if the current browser handles "pageshow". Possible?
[16:31:45] <ajpiano> not 1, and 0px
[16:31:52] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, it defintiely doesn't
[16:31:54] <imsky> atxq, yeah, * is what you want, but don't use it
[16:32:10] <ajpiano> pageshow is just some random event you made it up in your code
[16:32:11] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Firefox does.
[16:32:17] <atxq> div doesn't work, so I opted for *
[16:32:18] <min|dvir|us> False.
[16:32:24] <ajpiano> hum
[16:32:25] <min|dvir|us> pageshow is a bfcache event.
[16:32:28] <ajpiano> well, look at that
[16:32:29] <imsky> atxq, what are you trying to do?
[16:32:58] <atxq> when hover, display a border around whatever I hover over
[16:33:10] <min|dvir|us> You don't need JS for that.
[16:33:30] <atxq> I know, but I am using jquery to do that I on the fly
[16:33:50] <min|dvir|us> I'd like to know if the current browser handles "pageshow". Possible?
[16:34:06] <Vorspire> ?toggleClass @ atxq
[16:34:06] <bot-t> atxq, .toggleClass(className): Add or remove a class from each element in the set of matched elements, depending on either the class's presence or the value of the switch argument. http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[16:34:21] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: this pageshow event seems like a proprietary vestige that people shouldn't be developing around
[16:34:27] <min|dvir|us> Also false.
[16:34:50] <meosweetmeo> var testb =  {"catalog": "s" }
[16:34:50] <meosweetmeo> var bbb = $.parseJSON(testb);
[16:34:50] <meosweetmeo> console.log(bbb);
[16:34:51] <min|dvir|us> Modern browsers use bfcache and it is very necessary.
[16:34:52] <meosweetmeo> null
[16:34:55] <meosweetmeo> why?
[16:35:10] <imsky> meosweetmeo: you're not parsing anything, that's an object already
[16:35:29] <ajpiano> hum
[16:35:34] <meosweetmeo> no
[16:35:38] <meosweetmeo> i just gave an example
[16:35:45] <meosweetmeo> i have a well-formed json
[16:35:48] <min|dvir|us> meosweetmeo: Your example is flawed.
[16:35:52] <imsky> ok host your example on jsbin or jsfiddle
[16:35:54] <meosweetmeo> with double quotes etc
[16:36:17] <bobdobbs> ajpiano: Are  you sure that I can't use $.post to send a multidimensional array? Can you elaborate on that a little?
[16:36:32] <ajpiano> bobdobbs, you can send key value pairs with post
[16:36:36] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: My goal is to not call $(document).trigger('pageshow') if it is handled automatically.
[16:36:37] <min|dvir|us> Doable?
[16:36:37] <ajpiano> not infinitely deep unstrucutred data
[16:36:46] <meosweetmeo> http://pastebin.com/bw94XWQi
[16:37:04] <imsky> i gave you two sites and you picked a third lololol
[16:37:10] <imsky> thanks broooo
[16:37:15] <ajpiano> meosweetmeo, the you want to find the number of objects in the models array?
[16:37:19] <imsky> gonna have fun testing it IN PASTEBIN
[16:37:35] <meosweetmeo> stay cool man
[16:37:42] <imsky> i'm so frosty
[16:37:47] <meosweetmeo> yes

[16:38:50] <meosweetmeo> how the heck do i get it?
[16:38:56] <imsky> meosweetmeo: unfortunately man, the testb variable is still already an object
[16:39:01] <imsky> so what you do is simple
[16:39:05] <imsky> testb.catalog.models.length
[16:39:13] <ajpiano> meosweetmeo  var bbb = $.parseJSON(testb) bbb.catalog.models.length
[16:39:18] <ajpiano> oh lol

[16:41:11] <imsky> да да
[16:41:17] <meosweetmeo> ))
[16:41:23] <imsky> lolol
[16:41:33] <Anticom> click-method somehow doesn't work =(
[16:41:45] <meosweetmeo> RUSSIAN ATTACK!11
[16:41:50] <the_new_harley> ajpiano: not worked for the selector, but when I removeClass and addClass, it keeps the default activeNav as the not element. this is what I was askinga bout in the first place ;)
[16:41:55] <imsky> RUSSIAN TEAM GOOOOO
[16:42:04] <meosweetmeo> xD
[16:42:29] <ajpiano> the_new_harley that is why i was saying, you need to filter an existing set at the time of the click
[16:42:32] <ajpiano> not in the selector when you bind it
[16:42:52] <Anticom> http://pastebin.com/gvPTPbA3
[16:43:14] <Anticom> i know it's formatted and styled crappy, just want to understand the principles of jq
[16:43:20] <the_new_harley> ajpiano: right. but will the set update each time it has classed added and removed?
[16:43:26] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, this could be helpful http://perfectionkills.com/detecting-event-support-without-browser-sniffing/
[16:43:34] <min|dvir|us> Interesting.
[16:43:41] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us: (it is helpful, i was able to test for the existence of pageshow using the isEventSupported impl provided there)
[16:43:56] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Awesome!
[16:44:11] <Anticom> what am i doing wrong, so that .click() won't work?
[16:44:22] <ajpiano> the_new_harley, it doesn't *need* to update the set
[16:44:30] <ajpiano> you start with all the foo's
[16:44:34] <ajpiano> and then when any foo is click
[16:44:36] <ajpiano> you look at the set of foos
[16:44:42] <rns> is there a way to get the jqui calendar to work without using the id on the text input?
[16:44:44] <ajpiano> and fitler out the one that has a particular class
[16:44:52] <ajpiano> rns you can use any selector you like
[16:44:55] <the_new_harley> but that's why they introduced live, for on-the-fly html changes
[16:45:08] <the_new_harley> wasnt it?
[16:45:30] <ajpiano> you could do it with live if you did $("foo:not(bar)") instead of the .not method
[16:45:36] <the_new_harley> sorry ajpiano I'm really struggling to grasp the difference
[16:45:52] <ajpiano> live is just an abstraction for "doing that filtering at the time the event happens"
[16:45:59] <smykes24> ajpiano: when you get a second can i ask you a question about some coe I have please
[16:46:08] <ajpiano> smykes24, ask away
[16:46:25] <smykes24> can I show you privately?
[16:46:26] <ajpiano> Anticom, there is no for each loop in js
[16:46:31] <rns> ajpiano, so I could just put my text input html wrapped in a div, and then use the div id?
[16:46:31] <ajpiano> i would prefer not
[16:46:40] <ajpiano> ya
[16:46:46] <ajpiano> $("#foo input").datepicker()
[16:46:47] <ajpiano> etc.
[16:46:50] <smykes24> ajpiano can i paste it to you privately and we can talk about it publicly?
[16:46:54] <ajpiano> ok
[16:46:57] <smykes24> ty
[16:46:59] <Anticom> but i've commented that part, so the stuff left should work, shouldn't it? =/
[16:47:17] <ajpiano> Anticom, the click bind should be inside of the doucment ready block
[16:47:27] <Anticom> okay
[16:47:39] <smykes24> ajpiano: the desired effect is when you drag out of the upper column the input cleas
[16:47:55] <djQuery> $.observable.Array.move = function(oldIndex, newIndex, numToMove){};   wouldnt this overwite move with my own function?
[16:48:01] <djQuery> http://jsbin.com/uxenub/48/edit
[16:48:24] <glen1> I made my first jquery plugin :D
[16:48:31] <ajpiano> smykes24, it looks you have a bad selector
[16:48:47] <smykes24> ajpiano: in the drop: part?
[16:48:47] <ajpiano> oh wait, that seems to actually be by design
[16:48:48] <ajpiano> :/
[16:48:49] <ajpiano> nm
[16:49:15] <the_new_harley> ajpiano: aliasing doesn't make a difference
[16:49:40] <ajpiano> the_new_harley: give me your link again
[16:49:51] <Anticom> okay fine, ajpiano "for (var i in use) {" should work instead of foreach, shouldn't it?
[16:49:52] <the_new_harley> var myDamnNavs = $('#nav li a'); 	myDamnNavs.not('.activeNav').hover(function(){ still only works for what I originally hard coded .activeNav to be
[16:49:58] <ajpiano> Anticom: yes
[16:50:06] <the_new_harley> even after I've removed its class and added it to a clicked nav
[16:50:09] <the_new_harley> http://baffleinc.com/
[16:50:30] <ajpiano> the_new_harley, you're supposed to do that *inside* of the hover handler
[16:50:43] <the_new_harley> oh right
[16:50:44] <glen1> does anyone wanna check out my first jquery plugin? https://github.com/glensm/jquery-fontchanger
[16:51:05] <glen1> i just made it because I got annoyed with not knowing what fonts to use, typography etc
[16:51:05] <imsky> glen1: looks good my brudda
[16:51:12] <ajpiano> smykes24, sorry mate, it's a bit hard for me to make heads or tails of this
[16:51:14] <imsky> hire a designer to do that next time ;)
[16:51:27] <smykes24> ajpiano: i understand
[16:51:30] <glen1> thanks imsky, yeah i call it brute force typography!
[16:51:32] <glen1> :D
[16:51:36] <imsky> haha
[16:51:57] <imsky> i think it'd actually work better as a live demo
[16:52:41] <glen1> oh dam I thought github lets you run that
[16:52:45] <imsky> it does
[16:52:48] <imsky> gh-pages
[16:52:54] <glen1> ill check that out thanks imsky
[16:52:58] <imsky> np bud
[16:53:18] <smykes24> ajpiano: thank you for at least looking
[16:53:26] <ajpiano> welcome
[16:53:32] <glen1> I always though github was  paid service, didnt know there was a free package :D
[16:53:44] <imsky> most people use it for free ;)
[16:53:48] <smykes24> ajpiano: maybe if I can simplify it down ill have more sucess
[16:53:56] <ajpiano> wise words
[16:54:07] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: I am not entirely sure how I can use that with window.
[16:54:32] <ajpiano> just include that isEventSupported snippet and do isEventSupported("pageshow")
[16:56:22] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: You tried it?
[16:56:26] <djQuery> $.observable.Array.move = function(oldIndex, newIndex, numToMove){};   wouldnt this overwite move with my own function? http://jsbin.com/uxenub/48/edit
[16:56:33] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us, i'm not sure though, it might be a false positive
[16:56:42] <ajpiano> it comes up true in FF, and false in chrome, which is as expected
[16:56:51] <min|dvir|us> Chrome supports pageshow.
[16:56:54] <ajpiano> but i can't figure out which element type it's finding the event on
[16:57:02] <ajpiano> well then yeah, this test is broken
[16:57:03] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: div.
[16:57:13] <ajpiano> yeah, i mean, i saw that  - and that's what made me think "false positive"
[16:57:23] <Davey> Hey, I'm running into a race condition between when the DOM has the width/height of something and when I'm calling it
[16:57:39] <Davey> how can I delay execution till tmp.html(...) is complete?
[16:57:51] <Davey> I tried tmp.ready() but that doesn't work
[16:57:55] <the_new_harley> ajpiano I just dont get it man... my handler is $('nav li a').hover() so that it targets the specific one that is being hovered.. how can you ask on the fly if that specific one has the activeNav class?
[16:58:06] <imsky> Davey: .html is instant
[16:58:13] <Davey> imsky: not the rendering
[16:58:22] <ajpiano> $(this).hasClass("activeNav") ...
[16:58:49] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us - you can listen for the event and set a flag and then check if the flag is set and only then trigger page show
[16:58:50] <the_new_harley> whats the point in aliasing them all then
[16:58:53] <ajpiano> seems circuitous, however...
[16:58:59] <ajpiano> as pageshow fires after jquery's doc ready anyway
[16:59:03] <Davey> imsky: it's the only reason why putting a breakpoint there will fix it
[16:59:22] <ajpiano> the_new_harley because i was gonna say to filter the set by originalSet.not(this).doSomething()
[16:59:26] <imsky> Davey: rethink your problem ;)
[16:59:45] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: pageshow happens more than once./
[16:59:45] <ajpiano> Davey, you can try the old setTimeout(fn,0) trick
[16:59:59] <Anticom> i don't get how to pass data through the ajax method... is there a good tutorial for beginners?
[17:00:00] <ajpiano> more than once... when?
[17:00:03] <ajpiano> per page load
[17:00:07] <Anticom> and yes, i read the documentation
[17:00:09] <Davey> ajpiano: that's where I'm kinda at :/
[17:00:10] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Every page show.
[17:00:16] <min|dvir|us> When you click back to the page.
[17:00:25] <Davey> imsky: it's the result of a ajax response, I need it's rendered width/height
[17:00:27] <ajpiano> so does document ready...
[17:00:32] <min|dvir|us> No.
[17:00:32] <RoosterJuice_> how do you post to the current page?
[17:00:38] <ajpiano> that's how feature testing works - the tests run on every page load
[17:00:38] <min|dvir|us> It's stored in bfcache.
[17:00:47] <imsky> Davey: oh i've been there before
[17:01:00] <Davey> imsky: any solution? ;/
[17:01:04] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: When you click the browser's back button and you end up on the page again, pageshow happens.
[17:01:12] <imsky> cache the dimensions :D Davey
[17:01:13] <min|dvir|us> But only in browsers that support bfcache.
[17:01:29] <Davey> imsky: I can't cache them... I don't /have/ them
[17:01:40] <imsky> what's your script doing exactly
[17:02:18] <RoosterJuice_> if i'm posting a form using jquery.post() and I want it to post to the current page i'm on, do I just leave the url blank?
[17:02:40] <Davey> imsky: on ajax success, it's doing: tmp.html(data); then calling another function which does tmp.width() and tmp.height()
[17:02:43] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us - i realise this might be beside the point  - but is this all so that people will have the interstitial page animation ?
[17:02:48] <Davey> without a breakpoint, they return the wrong values
[17:02:48] <min|dvir|us> Yes.
[17:03:01] <min|dvir|us> Also, learning.
[17:03:02] <ajpiano> min|dvir|us - have you considered using a hashchange based approach
[17:03:08] <Anticom> okay data submission seems to be fine, problem is the format
[17:03:10] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: That's cross-browser?
[17:03:17] <ajpiano> if you use see ?bbq
[17:03:17] <bot-t> BBQ, a jQuery plugin that enables simple, yet powerful bookmarkable#hash history via a cross-browser window.onhashchange event. In addition, jQuery BBQ provides a full jQuery.deparam() method, along with both fragment and query string parse and merge utility methods - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-bbq-plugin/
[17:03:44] <ajpiano> or a few other history polyfills that support pushstate, etc
[17:03:47] <min|dvir|us> I think I might use that. I am considering a one-page layout.
[17:03:57] <imsky> Davey: put some time between the .width and .height and the .html
[17:04:02] <ajpiano> this way you could run your animation after that event, and back/forward would work
[17:04:06] <ajpiano> and you could load the content via ajax
[17:04:16] <ajpiano> ya
[17:04:28] <min|dvir|us> ajpiano: Interesting.
[17:05:03] <ajpiano> yah
[17:05:11] <imsky> ya man
[17:06:56] <ajpiano> i will withhold comment as to whether or not users enjoy interstitial page navigation animations :)
[17:07:43] <imsky> lol
[17:07:49] <ajpiano> you would def get a lot more learning out of trying out the hash-based approach tho, that's for sure - it's a popular and contemporary approach
[17:07:53] <imsky> welcome...to page transitions
[17:07:55] <imsky> in 1997
[17:08:45] <imsky> fire up that ol' IE6 and take a trip down memory lane: http://www.boogiejack.com/transition_effects.html
[17:08:55] <imsky> man we had DISSOLVE in those days
[17:09:06] <imsky> now you'd have to engineer some sort of canvas thing
[17:12:04] <Hopsy> I really hate that clap site >.>
[17:12:10] <systemfault> IE used to be where the innovations were...
[17:12:40] <atxq> what is ie6? hahahah
[17:12:56] <imsky> it's the grand daddy of the first half of the 2000s
[17:13:27] <imsky> with GROWING CIRCLE transition
[17:13:31] <imsky> omg
[17:13:34] <systemfault> IE10 PP2 has positionned floats
[17:13:35] <atxq> tried to see the effect but nthing happened...don't even have ie installed to see it
[17:13:38] <imsky> i guess we can do svg masks and iframes?
[17:14:03] <imsky> atxq: that's why i said "fire up that ol' IE6"
[17:14:07] <Hopsy> I was typing my workpiece till www.oksoclap.com went down the power, I am really frustrated about this  -.-'
[17:14:08] <imsky> i see some glorious stuff right now
[17:14:19] <Hopsy> can someone help me to get my data back :'(
[17:14:19] <imsky> workpiece?
[17:14:30] <Hopsy> school things
[17:14:35] <Hopsy> =.='
[17:14:37] <imsky> lol cloud computing at its finest
[17:14:40] <imsky> ladies and gentlemen
[17:15:07] <vladikoff> Hopsy, one sec, bring it up
[17:15:07] <ajpiano> Hopsy: asking vladikoff to fix it now :)
[17:15:37] <Hopsy> owh, he build that haha :p
[17:16:28] <Hopsy> wauw, i cant wait, vladikoff. You are my herro! :P
[17:21:02] <Hopsy> vladikoff: please dont delete any file :(
[17:21:07] <Hopsy> pleeassee :(
[17:21:09] <vladikoff> Hopsy, hold on
[17:21:19] <Hopsy> okay
[17:23:10] <vladikoff> Hopsy, try now
[17:23:23] <Hopsy> Yeaaahh :D
[17:23:26] <Hopsy> works :p
[17:23:32] <Hopsy> i will make a backup right now
[17:23:53] <Hopsy> I really appreciate it thankss
[17:24:03] * Hopsy hugs vladikoff
[17:24:23] <Edler> Hopsy: how did you do this --> * Hopsy hugs vladikoff
[17:24:51] <Hopsy> slash me and then some text
[17:25:03] <Hopsy> "/me some text
[17:25:48] <Hopsy> So Edler when are you going to hug me? :p
[17:26:40] <dorigentoo> Hi
[17:28:06] <dorigentoo> When I'm doing $(".results").load("myurl .results"), I'm getting <div class="results"><div class="results"></div></div>. How can I just get the innerHTML of the loaded result ?
[17:28:11] * Edler Freddy Hugs Hopsy
[17:28:18] * Edler Hugs Hopsy
[17:28:29] <imsky> 0_o
[17:28:48] * Edler says that everyone should check his online presentation --> YourWebSecurity.com
[17:28:55] * Hopsy awww that's really sweet
[17:29:07] * Edler lol this is awesome
[17:29:08] * imsky thinks yourwebsecurity.com is a fake antivirus program
[17:29:32] * Edler tells imsky to check the presentation
[17:29:38] <imsky> no wai jose
[17:29:57] <imsky> hahaha
[17:29:59] <imsky> unresponsive design
[17:30:03] <imsky> a victory for all :P
[17:30:27] <Edler> hehe
[17:30:31] <Edler> anyone here using symfony2 ?
[17:30:40] <imsky> ##php is --> that way
[17:31:07] <Edler> no one answers on the #symfony channel :(
[17:33:54] <glen1> ive been using the delegate function, when I do a console.log, it shows the div and the h1 that I clicked
[17:34:06] <glen1> is it possible to only use the h1, and not the parent div
[17:36:32] <Stephen> Assuming this: $.when(deferredSingleOrArray).then(function(obj){ var X; })
[17:36:50] <Stephen> Can anyone help me understand the scope/context of X?
[17:37:37] <imsky> it's in an anonymous function?
[17:38:08] <Stephen> Well, it's inside then(resolveFunc)
[17:38:25] <Stephen> .then() is a Deferred chaining method
[17:39:24] <Stephen> the anonymous function is handling then's first parameter, which is used when the Deferred in question is resolved.
[17:42:05] <Anticom> how can i check, which key was pressed with .keypress()?
[17:42:14] <imsky> Anticom: by checking the event
[17:42:44] <Anticom> and how would that look like?
[17:42:56] <Anticom> somehow i can't realy coup with the jq doc =/
[17:43:16] <imsky> it looks like the example on ?keypress
[17:44:03] <Vorspire> event.keyCode
[17:44:24] <Anticom> oh i see
[17:44:27] <Anticom> thanks
[17:44:28] <Vorspire> you'll have to find out what keys are what code before testing
[17:45:46] <Vorspire> ?g "keyboard key codes" @ Anticom
[17:45:47] <bot-t> Anticom, Keyboard: Key Codes - http://www.bebox.nu/bebooks/BeBookR5/Keyboard/KeyboardKeyCodes.html
[17:46:09] <imsky> the ?keypress example can literally tell you immediately
[17:46:16] <Anticom> alright
[17:46:53] <Anticom> and how can i pass variables from one dollar-function to another?
[17:47:30] <Anticom> oh forgett about it, no need i see^^
[17:49:45] <Vorspire> http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/JmKM4/
[17:50:02] <Anticom> http://pastebin.com/vhzaSe7V this doesn't work :/
[17:50:32] <Vorspire> ?doesnt work
[17:50:33] <bot-t> What do you mean it doesn't work? What happens when you try to run it? What's the output? What's the error message? Saying "it doesn't work" is pointless.
[17:50:40] <Anticom> i'm removing the innerHTML from the dbl-clicked li and replace it with an input, that work's fine so far
[17:51:01] <Anticom> haha i like bot-t
[17:51:37] <Anticom> but when i press the return key the textfield should dissapear again and the edited text should be appended as innerhtml again to the li-node
[17:52:23] <Vorspire> so it's not finding the key?
[17:52:56] <the_new_harley> imsky: on http://baffleinc.com/ regarding state saving/bookmarking, is there a way to edit the url hash without making the browser scroll to it?
[17:53:02] <Vorspire> I don't think which picks up the enter key, only in keyDown/keyUp... not sure, unless it's been fixed since then. try event.keyCode == 13
[17:53:15] <the_new_harley> I tried window.location.hash = hash but it takes away my animation :(
[17:53:38] <ajpiano> Anticom: it's not working because the elements aren't in the dom when you run the bind
[17:53:49] <imsky> the_new_harley: yes, make the url hash one that doesn't exist in the document ;)
[17:53:56] <Anticom> hmm ajpiano and how can i make it work?
[17:54:04] <ajpiano> you can use live
[17:54:07] <Anticom> (the most simple way)
[17:54:10] <Anticom> live?
[17:54:23] <the_new_harley> imsky: that defeats the purpose, as I want it to revisit it when bookmarked
[17:54:26] <ajpiano> Anticom: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide23 and the next few after it
[17:54:41] <the_new_harley> i.e. scroll back down when the direct link is accessed
[17:54:46] <imsky> the_new_harley: in that case, look into your animation code and see if you can pass an extra parameter to the function that scrolls
[17:55:27] <the_new_harley> hm
[17:55:47] <Anticom> ajpiano: and i can use live() with keypress as first arg?
[17:55:54] <ajpiano> yep
[17:56:24] <the_new_harley> imsky: is there a way to change window.location.hash so that it happens after my animation?
[17:56:34] <the_new_harley> chain**
[17:56:35] <Anticom> that's cool
[17:56:45] <Anticom> i'm falling in love with jq more and more (=
[17:57:38] <sam350> harley  $("#mydiv").fadeOut(function(){ location.hash="whatever"; })
[17:57:56] <the_new_harley> ah
[17:57:58] <the_new_harley> fankyou
[17:58:02] <PKKid> Anticom, Of course you are. ;)
[17:58:06] <sam350> harley you can adapt that to whatever animation you want to do instead of fadeout.  if you pass a callback to an animation, it will run after it completes
[17:58:09] <Anticom> ajpiano: but this.getAttribute('value'); is returning the old value now =/
[17:58:19] <PKKid> woah, whats "location.hash" do?
[17:58:26] <ajpiano> you should use .val() ....
[17:58:32] <Anticom> PKKid: hashing locations? =D
[17:58:41] <imsky> the_new_harley: not really, you'll have to call window.location
[17:58:42] <PKKid> what does that even mean?
[17:58:47] <Anticom> dunno (:
[17:58:53] <PKKid> lol
[17:59:21] <Anticom> you know i't 3 am here and i'm realy ambitious to learn jq but my brain is starting to blow up
[17:59:31] <imsky> go to sleep
[17:59:36] <imsky> everything will be clear in the morning
[17:59:36] <Anticom> no option
[17:59:39] <PKKid> Anticom, gnight
[17:59:45] <Anticom> want to get this done (=
[17:59:59] <imsky> trust someone who's gone without sleep many more times than you have
[18:00:01] <imsky> go to bed
[18:00:05] <the_new_harley> PKKid: when you have myexample.com/#portfolio
[18:00:08] <imsky> you'll solve it in your sleep
[18:00:32] <Anticom> okay so back to topic... i've replaced the innerHTML with an textinput and now when i change the value and want to get the value by using this.getAttribute('value') i'm getting the old value instead of the edited
[18:00:36] <Anticom> how can i fix that?
[18:00:53] <PKKid> the_new_harley, Ohh neat, I always just put the full address.
[18:01:05] <the_new_harley> PKKid
[18:01:07] <the_new_harley> what do you mean
[18:01:21] <Anticom> imsky: i enjoy working at night, because no one is annoying and i got plenty of coffee left ;)
[18:01:45] <imsky> Anticom: alright good luck bud
[18:01:51] <PKKid> the_new_harley, nevermind.. I was thinking of something else I think.  I get it now.
[18:01:56] <imsky> the_new_harley: setting window.location.hash works! so you can try that i guess
[18:02:01] <Anticom> imsky: got a suggestion for my question?
[18:02:13] <imsky> Anticom: jsfiddle it, por favor
[18:02:21] <Anticom> kay
[18:02:45] <the_new_harley> imsky: can you see anything wrong with this? http://pastebin.com/nGmVdaeh
[18:03:14] <imsky> the_new_harley: where is trgt set
[18:03:33] <the_new_harley> right thanks, its not a global var
[18:03:52] <imsky> well it's not obviously wrong ;)
[18:03:57] <imsky> run it and see i suppose
[18:04:08] <the_new_harley> hm still doesn't work
[18:04:16] <the_new_harley> ill redefine it within the new function
[18:04:42] <Anticom> imsky: http://jsfiddle.net/BGxgy/
[18:05:33] <imsky> where's .sortable?
[18:05:34] <the_new_harley> imsky: http://pastebin.com/sWnyEpd4
[18:05:45] <the_new_harley> imsky: in jquery ui
[18:05:52] <imsky> gotcha
[18:06:11] <imsky> the_new_harley: where does this.href refer to?
[18:06:39] <the_new_harley> the a thats clicked to make the animation
[18:06:49] <imsky> yeah that's not gonna be picked up
[18:06:57] <the_new_harley> sheeeit
[18:06:59] <imsky> you're either targeting the window or the html,body selector with that
[18:07:10] <imsky> Anticom: run me through what you want this thing to do
[18:07:17] <the_new_harley> ah
[18:07:29] <Anticom> simply want to make the content of the li's editable
[18:07:36] <Anticom> but without using any plugin
[18:07:46] <imsky> Anticom: http://html5demos.com/contenteditable
[18:07:47] <Anticom> want to keep it as small as possible
[18:07:56] <the_new_harley> imsky: if I replcae it with $(this) should it work?
[18:08:08] <Anticom> imsky: does IE6 support html5?
[18:08:10] <imsky> the_new_harley: no, because $(this) will refer to html,body
[18:08:23] <imsky> Anticom: microsoft doesn't support ie6, i think you're ok
[18:08:37] <the_new_harley> imsky: i mean if I define it in $(.scroll).click(function(){})
[18:08:53] <Anticom> but most of the companies (and especially ours) still seem to like IE6 however
[18:08:54] <imsky> the_new_harley: no, because $(this) refers to the last thing outside of $(this)
[18:09:06] <imsky> Anticom: in that case, let me take a look
[18:09:28] <imsky> Anticom: though i don't understand your aversion to plugins, since you're building one yourself
[18:09:46] <Anticom> the ones i've found are with edit-buttons etc
[18:09:52] <Anticom> want to do it my way ;P
[18:09:57] <Anticom> and i do want to learn jq
[18:10:17] <Anticom> that is the most important aspect, why i want to do it on my own
[18:11:40] <imsky> Anticom: ok, 1 minute
[18:12:00] <Anticom> okay, time for new coffee and a cigarette
[18:12:04] <Anticom> brb if you don't mind
[18:12:17] <imsky> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/BGxgy/1/
[18:13:19] <Anticom> thank's a lot
[18:13:21] <imsky> np
[18:14:46] <Anticom> just one last question for fine-tuning
[18:14:51] <imsky> yeap
[18:15:06] <Anticom> is there a way to set the focus inside the textbox, after inserting it into the dom?
[18:15:20] <imsky> one sec
[18:15:45] * Anticom declares imsky as his personal hero of the day (or let's better say of the night) (:
[18:16:12] <imsky> lol woo
[18:19:36] <imsky> ok was just hung up on some firefox stuff
[18:19:46] <imsky> jsfiddle is a little bit weird when you're not just looking at the result
[18:20:03] <imsky> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/BGxgy/3/
[18:20:48] <seanjean718> hi guys, I've been looking around on the web, but haven't found a working solution to problem:  how can I set the input elements of a form including the submit button to be disabled right after the submit request is fired?  I'm having trouble with this because sometimes the elements would get disabled prior to submission and none of the input is actually sent
[18:21:22] <imsky> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/BGxgy/4/ a little less syntax
[18:21:55] <iszak> seanjean718, $('form').find('input,select,button,textarea').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[18:21:56] <iszak> or so
[18:22:05] <Anticom> imsky: thank's but i think first attempt is easier for me to understand (=
[18:22:29] <seanjean718> iszak, that doesn't work because teh parameters from the form then isn't passed to the server in my rails application
[18:22:29] <imsky> ok glad to help
[18:22:41] <seanjean718> iszak, I have tried that already, thanks though
[18:22:49] <iszak> seanjean718, use readonly then
[18:22:58] <iszak> attr('readonly', 'readonly')
[18:23:00] <Anticom> imsky: but ajax is submitting the id's now instead of the innerHTML =/
[18:23:10] <seanjean718> oh
[18:23:16] <ajpiano> seanjean718, use the beforeSend callback
[18:23:16] <imsky> i'll take a look at that in a moment, anticom
[18:23:34] <seanjean718> ajpiano, I'm not actually doing an ajax call
[18:23:38] <Anticom> yep, i'm going for my cigarette finally
[18:23:38] <ajpiano> oh
[18:23:42] <seanjean718> iszak, does that work with fire fox?
[18:23:47] <iszak> ?tias
[18:23:47] <bot-t> Try It And See
[18:23:58] <seanjean718> I just want to know .. is this not possible with a normal HTTP request?
[18:25:17] <iszak> why's your motivation for wanting to do it seanjean718 ?
[18:25:22] <iszak> to prevent resubmission or something?
[18:25:38] <seanjean718> iszak, yea :)
[18:26:01] <iszak> better done server side using a unique hidden field
[18:29:34] <Anticom> imsky: btw: if you need help with php, just let me know (=
[18:29:51] <iszak> I somehow doubt that.
[18:29:59] <imsky> Anticom: will do, give me a couple minutes
[18:30:36] <Anticom> yeah, no need to hurry up for me... i'm bussy either way
[18:33:49] <imsky> Anticom: why are you using sortable to send the AJAX data?
[18:34:08] <Anticom> how else should i manage to do that?
[18:34:34] <imsky> well tell me what it is you want to do
[18:34:37] <Anticom> when i entered this chan i've asked how to pass the information of a sortable list properly
[18:34:58] <Anticom> i want to send an array of all the elements in the correct order
[18:35:14] <Anticom> oh wait
[18:35:48] <Anticom> damn... perfect would be objects containing the original name and the edited name
[18:36:14] <Anticom> because otherwise i can't access the table rows in the DB =/
[18:36:14] <imsky> hmm
[18:36:17] <Anticom> silly me
[18:36:32] <Anticom> could simply use the li's ID  to store the original name, can't i?
[18:37:08] <Anticom> yeah, works
[18:37:32] <imsky> sure, sure
[18:37:39] <Anticom> now i only need to find a way to build an array/object whatever (JSON would be nice) to send id and innerhtml at one time
[18:40:50] <Vorspire> Anticom, there is a json_encode plugin for JQ
[18:41:24] <Anticom> yeah, but the question is: how do i get the id with it's corresponding innerHTML for each element?
[18:41:58] <imsky> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/BGxgy/6/
[18:43:37] <imsky> oh yeah, you don't need UI with this
[18:44:02] <Anticom> http://pastebin.com/Uv8UEYFm think i can work with that
[18:44:21] <imsky> json_decode($json,true); my friend ;)
[18:45:25] <Anticom> :P
[18:45:41] <Anticom> okay, i think the js part should be done for now...
[18:45:45] <Anticom> (=
[18:46:04] <Anticom> imsky: just to say it again, if you need help with php, just query me
[18:46:16] <imsky> will do bud, thanks for the offer
[18:46:36] <Anticom> and if you realy want to do me a favor, please explain: $('.change').each(function(){$(this).data("original-name",$(this).text())});
[18:47:25] <imsky> sure, it's a quick-n-dirty way of setting a data key of "original-name" for each HTML element with class "change" to its current text value, as returned by jQuery
[18:47:49] <imsky> the .each makes it iterate through all of the ".change" elements
[18:48:12] <SalmanPK> :D
[18:48:37] <Anticom> okay
[18:48:38] <Anticom> thanks
[18:48:42] <imsky> np mate
[18:49:24] <Vorspire> Oo
[18:49:25] <Vorspire> oO
[18:49:37] <imsky> o hello how r u
[18:50:01] <Vorspire> Very bored, almost 3 am
[18:50:07] <imsky> go to bed
[18:50:21] <Vorspire> Bored != Tired :)
[18:50:31] <imsky> hack up something cool
[18:50:44] <Vorspire> I did :D
[18:50:50] <imsky> show it to the world
[18:51:06] <SalmanPK>  :o
[18:51:12] <Vorspire> http://runuo.vita-nex.com
[18:51:22] <Vorspire> a software prototype
[18:51:38] <imsky> very smooth looking
[18:51:46] <Anticom> imsky: i'm almost a bit embarrased to ask you again, but now the problem is, that all li's get submitted and not only those in the ul with id="use" =/
[18:51:53] <imsky> and i see an error 404, vorspire
[18:52:02] <Anticom> is there a way to catch this issue with a simple if-clause?
[18:52:06] <imsky> Anticom: no prob bud
[18:52:09] <Vorspire> There are missing pages, currently filling in content
[18:52:17] <Vorspire> 404's are intentional
[18:52:34] <Vorspire> You can Log-In with: Test/test
[18:52:35] <imsky> Anticom: when you have the $(".change").each in $("#generate"), change it to $("#use .change").each
[18:52:39] <imsky> Vorspire: fill it with a dancing banana
[18:52:46] <imsky> 404 is so...boring :P
[18:52:47] <Vorspire> I might just do that :P
[18:53:12] <imsky> oooh i'm logged in
[18:53:13] <imsky> so smooth
[18:53:32] <imsky> my control panel is full of 404
[18:53:41] <imsky> my day would be so much brighter if i saw a dancing banana there instead
[18:54:05] <Vorspire> done
[18:54:09] <Anticom> okay works fine now (=
[18:54:48] <SalmanPK> :P
[18:55:09] <Vorspire> That dancing banana is a really nice addition actually :D
[18:55:13] <imsky> YES!
[18:55:18] <imsky> dancing banananananana
[18:55:41] <Vorspire> ^^
[18:55:58] <Anticom> peanut butter jelly time?
[18:56:04] <Vorspire> always
[18:56:08] <imsky> waaay out
[18:56:10] <imsky> waaaay out
[18:56:16] <imsky> now deehe go
[18:56:27] <Anticom> =D
[18:56:28] <SalmanPK> Zend Framework <3
[18:57:45] <Anticom> <--- do not like
[18:57:53] <Vorspire> imsky, here'sa little something that could be fun to mess with: http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/JmKM4/ :D
[18:58:24] <imsky> wow yeah that's engrossing
[18:59:05] <Vorspire> I never finished "object collision" or shapes.. or very much for that matter lol
[19:01:45] <SalmanPK> btw u can use this handy shortcut jQuery(function($){ }); :D
[19:02:04] <imsky> :DDDD
[19:03:02] <Vorspire> SalmanPK, in what context? :S
[19:03:30] <Anticom> lol
[19:04:11] <Vorspire> Isn't it terrible when people make ambiguous references to invisible statements they previously never made? :D
[19:04:13] <Anticom> btw Vorspire your nickname sounds similar to the german word for appetizer ;P
[19:05:21] <Vorspire> Oh? :)
[19:05:23] <Vorspire> lul
[19:05:25] <Vorspire> :P
[19:05:49] <SalmanPK> Vorspire: Instead of that self-executing anonymous function :)
[19:06:37] <Vorspire> SalmanPK, the self-executing anonymous function is within the context of JSFiddle's jQuery entry function :)
[19:06:43] <Vorspire> otherwise it wouldn't work
[19:07:35] <Vorspire> and you mean: (function($){ }(jQuery));
[19:09:06] <ryanseddon> Vorspire SalmanPK it's an immediately invoked function expression
[19:09:10] <SalmanPK> yeah. like this: http://jsfiddle.net/JmKM4/338/
[19:09:47] <ryanseddon> See here http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[19:10:45] <SalmanPK> ryanseddon: ahan reading that :D
[19:11:38] <Vorspire> idd, I'm not one to read tuts and that's a lot of reading about something I'll probably never say again lol
[19:13:39] <ryanseddon> it's important to know the correct terminology though
[19:13:44] <Vorspire> but yet, there were 2 reasons for it SalmanPK, 1: JSFiddle already wraps the code within that scope and 2: the GridX plugin code and the code that is the generic interface (the game) are separate for example's sake
[19:14:26] <Vorspire> ryanseddon; that is true, but I don't need to read a giant article to remember I should use one word instead of another :D
[19:14:50] <Vorspire> ben alman is a legend
[19:14:58] <Vorspire> I just hate reading lol
[19:15:06] <ryanseddon> right...
[19:15:29] <robertor> hi guys! how can i apply a style to <select> item? similar to <button> style?
[19:15:31] <SalmanPK> hmmm
[19:18:54] <Vorspire> robertor, $('select').wrap('<div/>').parent('div').addClass('ui-widget-header ui-state-default'); //Guess-work //You won't be able to make the input itself look as flashy
[19:19:12] <Vorspire> I have no idea if that will give the effect you want
[19:19:31] <Mnkras-Laptop> is there a list somewhere of all the effects that work with the accordion in ui?
[19:21:30] <Vorspire> Mnkras-Laptop, I would have thought it is covered on jqueryui.com documentation for the Accordion
[19:21:39] <SalmanPK> ryanseddon: Interesting read, Thanks. Will call it an "Immediately-Invoked Function Expression" from now :p. Also got to learn the module pattern :D
[19:21:44] <Mnkras-Laptop> yea, don't see it Vorspire
[19:21:55] <Mnkras-Laptop> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/
[19:22:05] <ryanseddon> SalmanPK: IIFE for short
[19:23:30] <Vorspire> Mnkras-Laptop, Choose your favorite animation, or disable them (set to false). In addition to the default, 'bounceslide' and all defined easing methods are supported ('bounceslide' requires UI Effects Core).
[19:23:42] <Vorspire> http://jqueryui.com/demos/accordion/#option-animated
[19:24:06] <SalmanPK> Oh ya. :) Though i'll will have to link many people to that article when saying that i guess :p
[19:24:09] <Mnkras-Laptop> ah easing
[19:24:09] <Mnkras-Laptop> :P
[19:24:20] <Vorspire> "all defined easing methods"
[19:24:21] <Vorspire> :)
[19:34:04] <robertor> Vorspire, thanks... that works for i  was looking :D
[19:34:37] <Vorspire> Awesome, lucky guess then hehe
[19:56:14] <Mnkras-Laptop> Vorspire: not all easing effects work, it lies!
[19:56:18] <Mnkras-Laptop> most don't work
[19:56:25] <Mnkras-Laptop> they just make it seem glitchy
[19:59:48] <hariom> I am using jquery min 1.6.1. But when I used deferred I get error:  $.when is not a function
[20:01:01] <iszak> probably because $ belongs to Prototype.
[20:01:25] <hariom> Here is what I am trying to do:  $.when(getTables()).then(showGlobalVariables()); in getTables, I am firing a $.getJSON request and in response I am setting some global variables that I use in .then
[20:01:46] <hariom> iszak: no, I don't have prototype linking
[20:01:55] <iszak> try jQuery.when then
[20:02:08] <hariom> iszak: rest of the jQuery function work great.
[20:02:09] <hariom> ok
[20:02:46] <hariom> iszak:jQuery.when is not a function
[20:03:02] <iszak> are you sure you're using 1.6.1?
[20:03:17] <hariom> iszak: is it possible that deferred doesn't work in 1.6.1 min?
[20:03:18] <hariom> yea
[20:03:21] <iszak> what does jQuery.fn.jquery return
[20:03:28] <iszak> i suppose it's possible, try 1.6.2?
[20:09:17] <djQuery> ?eval jQuery.fn.jquery
[20:09:19] <bot-t> djQuery: "1.4.2"
[20:09:50] <iszak> ...?
[20:10:11] <djQuery> iszak: bot-t is running an older version
[20:10:16] <iszak> tell temp01
[20:10:31] <Vorspire> You know what's wrong?
[20:10:39] <iszak> lots of things.
[20:10:40] <Vorspire> ?eval 1/0
[20:10:41] <bot-t> Vorspire: Infinity
[20:10:44] <Vorspire> THAT IS WRONG
[20:10:52] <iszak> no it's not.
[20:11:07] <Vorspire> Infinity is a concept, Indeterminate is the correct answer
[20:12:04] <systemfault> Hmm
[20:12:08] <systemfault> ?eval window
[20:12:09] <bot-t> systemfault: <global object>
[20:12:34] <systemfault> ?eval Object.keys(document)
[20:12:34] <bot-t> systemfault: ReferenceError: document is not defined
[20:12:41] <iszak> Take it to PMs.
[20:12:58] <systemfault> iszak: Don't you have anything else to do?
[20:13:08] <iszak> I'm working :D
[20:13:10] <iszak> but no
[20:13:13] <systemfault> I tried two things, I'm happy.
[20:13:25] <iszak> two things too many.
[20:21:17] <Stephen> When using Deferreds, can I pass paramters which will survive the use of when()?
[20:22:58] <hariom> anybody knows how to allow jquery.easing to use jquery 1.6.2. It looks like it doesn't work beyond 1.3.1
[20:23:17] <hariom> I am working on a legacy code that is using jquery.easing
[20:24:51] <Mnkras-Laptop> hariom: jquery UI has all the easing stuff
[20:24:51] <ryanneufeld> easing is built into 1.6.1 I think
[20:25:24] <hariom> Mnkras-Laptop: you mean I don't need jquery.easing anymore ?
[20:25:33] <hariom> ryanneufeld:
[20:25:48] <ryanneufeld> only one way to know
[20:25:54] <Mnkras-Laptop> http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/
[20:27:03] <Mnkras-Laptop> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/AdvancedEasing
[20:27:08] <amh345> is this proper syntax?  im not returning an errors.. but im also not getting the results i hoped for. $(this).next().slideDown('normal');
[20:31:14] <webguy024> I need some offtopic help - I entered an blog post into a contest on facebook. One of the posts is running a gorilla campaign to get their post to win. Mine is much better in my opinion. I'm cashing in all my internet karma on this one :) You can view the details in this post on reddit -> http://goo.gl/N0K1m
[20:31:49] <hariom> ryanneufeld, Mnkras-Laptop: I am getting error in this if I replace 1.3.1 with 1.6.2, don't know why:           var default_left = Math.round($('#lava li.selected').offset().left - $('#lava').offset().left);
[20:32:51] <Mnkras-Laptop> hariom: got UI?
[20:33:01] <hariom> yea
[20:33:15] <Mnkras-Laptop> weird
[20:33:36] <Mnkras-Laptop> you included effects.core.js when compiling it
[20:35:15] <hariom> error just says: $("#lava li.selected").offset() is null. I have ui core ui tabs and ui widgets
[20:35:35] <hariom> Mnkras-Laptop: I guess I don't have effects.core.js
[20:36:56] <ryanneufeld> the error you're getting is something else
[20:37:11] <ryanneufeld> what does console.log($("#lava li.selected")) output?
[20:39:37] <hariom> ryanneufeld: it gives a long list of parameters. http://pastebin.com/BH5ZeXjb
[20:40:18] <ryanneufeld> that seems not right....
[20:40:20] <Vorspire> hariom you have the class "selected" declared?
[20:40:29] <Vorspire> otherwise I think you want :selected
[20:41:08] <ryanneufeld> which won't work on an li
[20:42:25] <Vorspire> indeed
[20:45:42] <hariom> ok, I guess that js is no more needed as there is no effect on removing the entire legacy js. Menus seems to work good with 1.6.2
[20:46:20] <hariom> ryanneufeld, Vorspire: it was adding selected dynamically. But I guess now things are working good.
[20:46:59] <hariom> Good that you guys pointed me out for 'selected' class
[20:47:15] <Vorspire> :)
[20:47:28] <Vorspire> Sometimes all you need is a fresh set of eyes
[20:49:08] <iszak> they do eye transplants now? D:
[20:49:25] <hariom> :)
[20:49:52] <Vorspire> Who's is "they" anyway? :D
[20:50:06] <iszak> the hospitals?
[20:51:47] <iszak> maybe one day :(
[20:52:46] <ryanneufeld> I know cornia transplants are common
[20:53:58] <danieliser> can you modify the contents of a draggable clone when dropping it in a droppable or sortable but only the first time?
[20:57:03] <danieliser> anybody?
[20:57:39] <Vorspire> uhh you probably can
[20:57:56] <Vorspire> from what I've seen, pretty much anything is possible with JQ
[20:58:12] <Vorspire> unless you limit yourself to the plugins others write
[20:58:22] <danieliser> any idea how? i can get it to work kinda but it makes the changes over again if you reorder the sortable
[20:59:20] <Vorspire> you could store some tag on the elements with .data and check to see if the tag is set on each consecutive call afte the first time round
[21:02:40] <danieliser> that would work i guess.. 2 other things then.. how can i get the id of ui.draggable.. ive tried ui.draggable.attr('jd').. returns unidentified..
[21:03:35] <danieliser> and other would be if there are items already in the sortable at load what even would be best to add the .data() for each so they dont get modified?
[21:04:04] <Vorspire> what about .id()
[21:04:06] <Vorspire> ?id
[21:04:07] <bot-t> #id: Selects a single element with the given id attribute. http://api.jquery.com/id-selector/
[21:04:18] <Vorspire> hmm
[21:06:00] <lazyPower> djQuery: are you around?
[21:06:30] <Vorspire> danieliser, I think you'll have to go native
[21:06:53] <danieliser> well i need to get the id to use a switch to return different html for different dropped items
[21:07:01] <Vorspire> like: var elemId = $(this).id;
[21:07:08] <djQuery> nope
[21:08:25] <beginner> hi everyone I am working on a framework for iphone web apps called the m project based on jquery whenever i get a request from the database i get an object of object which is normal
[21:08:30] <beginner> i need to convert it to string
[21:08:34] <lazyPower> Hows your fourth goin man?
[21:08:34] <beginner> hwo can i do that ?
[21:08:38] <danieliser> tried alerting that.. shows undefined
[21:08:50] <lazyPower> rather, your holiday weekend
[21:09:04] <Vorspire> beginner, you can use Object.toString() - native
[21:09:16] <beginner> it returns undefined
[21:09:51] <Vorspire> try concatenating it
[21:09:53] <danieliser> lol.. sounds familiar.. cant get the id and have tried many methods ive found online that should work but dont
[21:10:15] <beginner> sorry it return object object again
[21:10:31] <beginner> it doesn't do anything
[21:12:34] <beginner> the toString doesn't make a difference
[21:12:45] <Vorspire> danieliser; http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/DUKHx/
[21:13:29] <Vorspire> beginner, try concatenating the object, like this: "my object is: " + someObject
[21:13:54] <beginner> ok i will try it thanks Vorspire
[21:14:31] <Vorspire> danieliser, for the love of... don't use ALERT to debug stuff :D
[21:14:54] <danieliser> tried console but i cant find the id there either
[21:15:11] <danieliser> Vorspire: best way then?
[21:15:24] <Vorspire> console.log()
[21:15:56] <danieliser> Vorspire:
[21:15:59] <Vorspire> using Firebug
[21:16:09] <danieliser> Vorspire:yea.. just tried.. still returns undefined
[21:16:27] <Vorspire> you got some code to look at?
[21:16:55] <danieliser> i can get the id fine in the sortable receive event function.. just not in the drop of droppable
[21:17:41] <Erthe> When performing a call with $.ajax(), how can I ensure that a constructed JSON object is available to me in the complete() callback when dataType = 'json'?
[21:19:29] <Vorspire> Erthe, whatever the target url outputs becomes "result" (argument 1 of success callback) - If your target URL is a PHP file, you could use json_encode to output a JSON object
[21:20:37] <Erthe> Vorspire: I am encoding the object, I wasn't using the success callback, I was using complete, maybe that's my issue?
[21:21:09] <danieliser> Vorspire:http://jsfiddle.net/danieliser/JAz5y/
[21:21:12] <Vorspire> yes :) use the success callback instead
[21:21:19] <Erthe> Ah, thanks  :D
[21:21:41] <Vorspire> Erthe, examples in my code: http://runuo.vita-nex.com/Framework/JavaScript/auth.vn.js
[21:23:55] <danieliser> Vorspire:any ideas?
[21:24:19] <Vorspire> none sorry :( I'd be more help if it wasn't 5.30 am and I'd been to sleep lol
[21:24:30] <Vorspire> looking though
[21:25:23] <Stephen> I'm sorry, I got distracted and my logs aren't going back that far
[21:25:45] <Stephen> is there any way to have a when() pass arguments to a then()?
[21:25:52] <danieliser> no worries.. can i make a global variable and assign it via the recieve function of the sortable?
[21:26:20] <Vorspire> danieliser, I'm going to bet that' the context of "this" isn't what you expect it to be :P, try logging "this" to see what it is
[21:27:15] <danieliser> Vorspire: refresh it.. also tried ui.draggable
[21:27:33] <danieliser> Vorspire: returns undefined as well
[21:28:32] <danieliser> Vorspire: i mean it should work.. i can add a class to ui.draggable.. but cant get the id using any jquery method
[21:28:52] <Vorspire> http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/JAz5y/3/
[21:28:55] <danieliser> tried .get .attr .id
[21:29:25] <beginner> it returns undefined
[21:29:36] <beginner> after the concatination
[21:29:36] <Vorspire> because $(this) at that point references a <UL> which doesn't have an ID attribute
[21:29:49] <Vorspire> beginner, can't help w/out code sorry
[21:29:58] <beginner> one second
[21:30:28] <Vorspire> danieliser, that link I posted, gets the ID "table-1" - is that what you wanted? because $(this) isn't in the proper context
[21:30:39] <danieliser> right.. like i said though ui.draggable should work but doesnt..  but as you can see i can still manage to add a class to it after dropping..
[21:31:17] <danieliser> no i need to get the id of the li that was dragged.. which should be somthing like addTextBox
[21:31:37] <Vorspire> it all seems to work fine for me :/
[21:32:30] <danieliser> you can get the id? how?
[21:32:58] <danieliser> i need the id of the li in the list on the right
[21:34:06] <Vorspire> how? look at the code I gave you :D
[21:34:08] <Vorspire> http://jsfiddle.net/Vorspire/JAz5y/3/
[21:34:18] <Vorspire> $(this).parent().attr('id);
[21:34:43] <Vorspire> oh wait
[21:34:47] <danieliser> that returns tabs-1.. i need it to return addTextBox if you drag TextBox to the list on the left
[21:34:48] <Vorspire> sorry didn't read what you said
[21:35:36] <beginner> http://www.pastie.org/2161206
[21:35:40] <beginner> this is the whole code
[21:35:54] <beginner> in order to use the model i need to convert the Json object to string
[21:37:10] <Vorspire> beginner, onSuccess is just success
[21:37:22] <Vorspire> oh wait
[21:37:22] <beginner> in the framework it is onsucess
[21:37:28] <danieliser> if you think of anything Vorspire can you send it to me in PM.. im gonna crash..
[21:37:30] <Vorspire> i should stop talking at 6am with no sleep
[21:37:49] <Vorspire> think i'll crash too :P
[21:37:59] <beginner> :D well i don't know what to say u are the only one who is responding to all the bugs
[21:37:59] <danieliser> thanks for the effort
[21:38:00] <beginner> lol
[21:38:03] <beginner> i feel so sorry for you
[21:38:54] <djQuery> lazyPower: did u need something
[21:39:15] <Vorspire> beginner, are you actually using jQuery? Oo
[21:39:30] <beginner> no i am using a framework called the m project based on jquery
[21:39:40] <beginner> so it isn't 100% ;pure jquery
[21:39:42] <beginner> lol
[21:39:56] <Vorspire> the best place to get help would be on their site/forums/discussion channels I think
[21:40:07] <beginner> unfortunately there is none there
[21:40:07] <beginner> lol
[21:40:17] <beginner> because it is a new framework and there is not much support though
[21:40:22] <beginner> so i thought i would come here
[21:40:23] <Vorspire> hence the flaws of using a 3rd party lib :D
[21:40:24] <lazyPower> djQuery:  no i was just asking how your holiday was going. I'm hacking away at some CSS trying to figure out why its not displaying properly :|
[21:40:51] <beginner> so i have to add a framework in the framework
[21:40:52] <beginner> EPIC!
[21:40:53] <beginner> lol
[21:40:58] <Vorspire> lazyPower, if it's CSS and it's not displaying properly, consider uninstalling IE :D
[21:41:31] <lazyPower> Vorspire: using FireFox - but what i'm fleshing out is a known issue, trying to get LI replacement images to align properly with the line-height property (or padding, and neither seem to be helping)
[21:41:53] <Vorspire> middle-align by chance?
[21:42:03] <lazyPower> Vorspire: hang on i'll add that and see what happens.
[21:42:18] <beginner> i will try to go on their chatrooms again thank you so much for your help Vorspire and good luck and get some sleep!
[21:42:26] <Vorspire> ;)
[21:42:36] <beginner> ;)
[21:42:52] <lazyPower> well, it completely vaporized the image, so no luck there :P
[21:43:09] <lazyPower> list-style-image: url(/content/images/about-menu-li.png) middle-align;  - looks correct right?
[21:43:59] <Vorspire> noooo
[21:44:11] <Vorspire> I was asking if you're trying to align stuff in the middle
[21:44:19] <lazyPower> oh, basically.
[21:44:42] <Vorspire> you have a working demo?
[21:44:44] <lazyPower> i have a 50/50px composite sprite and its being a pita :|
[21:44:57] <lazyPower> sure hang on and let me publish what i have going
[21:45:11] <Vorspire> just the code that matters though, not the whole page :D
[21:45:41] <lazyPower> ah you dont want to see what its doing?
[21:46:29] <Vorspire> I just need to see the HTML structure of the elements you're trying to apply CSS to and the CSS to go with
[21:47:47] <lazyPower> https://gist.github.com/1062921
[21:49:30] <Vorspire> ok, so the list-style-image is what you're trying to place and I guess it is messed up?
[21:49:40] <lazyPower> yeah, its off by about 20 pixels too high
[21:50:06] <Vorspire> hmm
[21:50:16] <lazyPower> hold up
[21:50:18] <lazyPower> i'll ss it
[21:50:25] <Vorspire> naw it's cool
[21:50:32] <Vorspire> you just need to define line-height I think
[21:50:42] <lazyPower> on the LI?
[21:51:04] <Vorspire> yes, set it to the same px as your image height
[21:51:17] <lazyPower> holy... that shot the content below the h3 down 50 px
[21:51:26] <lazyPower> hmm :/
[21:51:50] <Vorspire> oooff
[21:51:58] <Vorspire> kick in the nadz
[21:52:31] <Vorspire> things get awry with CSS when using floats btw so be careful :(
[21:53:15] <lazyPower> Yeah i'm aware that floats like to eat things.
[21:54:03] <Vorspire> stacking divs... side by side... horrible thing to accomplish :D
[21:54:21] <lazyPower> sadly, its a necessity for layout purposes
[21:54:43] <lazyPower> http://i.imgur.com/rGpBI.png
[21:54:53] <lazyPower> theres the current look of the jacked CSS i'm hacking away at fixing.
[21:55:07] <Vorspire> indeed, it took me a while to nail this layout: http://www.tyneside-traders.com - not a single float
[21:56:46] <lazyPower> right on
[21:56:58] <lazyPower> how'd you manage the two div's without floats? just setting margins?
[21:58:18] <Vorspire> nope, they position automagically, it's reliant on the element structure
[22:00:14] <Vorspire> jQuery handles the middle row's height, naturally if you set display to inline-block, the divs will align side-by-side, but you still have to take care of them being moved down. If I increase the width of the left or right div by just 0.01%, the right-side would have dropped below the left div
[22:00:44] <lazyPower> interesting
[22:00:50] <snover> they work by not showing a damn thing if you don’t have javascript enabled, apparently
[22:00:53] <Vorspire> but to prevent that, I contained them both in separate divs
[22:00:54] <snover> seo++!
[22:01:00] <Vorspire> each row is actually a stripped out LI
[22:02:41] <Vorspire> snover, who is silly enough to disable javascript? :D don't answer that
[22:02:53] <snover> every search engine on the planet
[22:03:08] <snover> guys with neckbeards
[22:03:15] <snover> locked down corporate workstations
[22:03:15] * lazyPower has one of those
[22:03:33] <snover> noscript users
[22:03:34] <lazyPower> then again, i also have a server farm in my closet too
[22:03:56] <lazyPower> << typical 1990's linux guy
[22:04:11] <Vorspire> Oh, I don't care about SEO or corporate work stations, or people who don't use JS :P
[22:04:53] <lazyPower> Vorspire: its awesome when your search engine results yield a nearly blank page, completely voiding your content.
[22:04:55] <snover> we specialize in advertising…just not our own site
[22:05:31] <lazyPower> UniversityBound had that issue for a while until i pulled a static page breakout from their "looks pretty" to "functions well in SEO principals"
[22:05:49] <lazyPower> speaking of which i still need to build some sitemaps...
[22:06:01] <snover> if only things could look good *and* be functional
[22:06:19] <Vorspire> because I don't need to be on a SE to get visitors for that site, people at work shouldn't breech the Computer Misuse Act and others who have JS disabled should consider uninstalling their brain, nevermind JS
[22:06:51] <lazyPower> hah, i do dislike it when id10t's complain about sites being broken when they have JS disabled.
[22:07:01] <lazyPower> they are only missing out on web 1.0 (let alone the 2.x features)
[22:07:28] <ajpiano> in other words, replacing floats with javascript positioning is like replacing _______ with _______
[22:07:43] <Vorspire> I didn't replace floats with JS positioning lol
[22:08:00] <lazyPower> snover: i think you have to be choosey about how flashey you go with content. Pick and Choose what you wrap in script.
[22:08:47] <lazyPower> does binding jquery to an element remove it from the search engine view? i dont think it does...
[22:10:23] <juha___> moooooooornin
[22:10:53] <snover> no, but having literally no actual content in the html that loads for a given URL is a sure fire way to have a search engine pick up no content whatsoever
[22:10:53] <Vorspire> It's awesome when people walk into a conversation half way through, make a statement without reading first and then go quiet after having it pointed out... :)
[22:11:52] <ajpiano> it's awesome when people interpret an entire minute of silence on irc as anything else than someone having other things to do with their hands :D
[22:12:20] <snover> fuckin hands, why only two
[22:12:24] <wookiehangover> YOU ANSWER ME NOW AJPIANO
[22:12:27] <ajpiano> obvs there's a difference between using like, responsive techniques that involve JS
[22:12:47] <Vorspire> It's awesome when people's sense of time is skewed enough for one to believe they'd visited a black hole for a few nanoseconds and returned to tell the tale.
[22:13:25] * lazyPower flips on some Lonely Island and resumes his CSS hacking
[22:13:38] <ajpiano> i think we can truly agree that it's really awesome to pick fights with people on sunday nights :D
[22:13:51] * ajpiano joins lazyPower ... in JAPAN
[22:14:28] <Vorspire> it's sunday morning for me, yet another drizzly day in England :/ get me out of here
[22:14:39] <Vorspire> Monday*
[22:21:41] <juha___> i knew that england is in different timezone, but didn't know that the difference is so big..
[22:28:53] <lazyPower> 9 hours from the east coast i beleive.
[22:30:05] <ajpiano> 5
[22:30:45] <ajpiano> you might have been thinking of the number of hours between germany and california
[22:30:48] <ajpiano> cause that's 9
[22:30:51] <ajpiano> :p
[22:31:16] <lazyPower> ajpiano: you're right, i'm GMT+5
[22:31:22] <lazyPower> i was thinking i was GMT+8
[22:31:32] <ajpiano> ah
[22:31:36] <ajpiano> where are you?
[22:31:45] <lazyPower> Pennsylvania UA
[22:31:49] <lazyPower> *usa
[22:31:55] <ajpiano> oh
[22:32:31] <ajpiano> we're -5, not +5 :p
[22:32:37] <lazyPower> minor details
[22:34:46] <ajpiano> well here i was thinking you were in the middle of russia and you're in the same timezone :p
[22:35:08] <lazyPower> For glorious KHAZAKSTAN!
[22:35:39] <juha___> the greatest country on earth
[22:36:35] <lazyPower> all i have to say, to defend my polluted sence of timezones, is i've been up since 7am, and its now  1:30 at night, and i'm doing this without the aid of jolt, or dew, or coffee... i need more pizza.
[22:37:14] <juha___> it's 8.30 am here
[22:40:45] <Vorspire> 6.30am, that makes 34 hours awake for me without energy drinks, coffee, etc, got a screaming baby who's just getting her teeth in too and a heap of work to get done for my client tonight :/
[22:42:22] <lazyPower> ouch
[22:45:34] <Chibby_> could someone please help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/Chib/kp2k4/ trying to get it so you can unselect a radio button by click it's associated label
[22:45:56] <Chibby_> it seems to work when you click several times really fast
[22:46:03] <Chibby_> i have no idea how it's doing that though lol
[22:46:12] <Chibby_> since i only put the click() event in
[22:48:13] <juha___> i think it's time for my morning whiskey ->
[22:48:15] <Chibby_> hmm, that behaviour only happens in ff5.0 actually, clicking it lots in chrome12 does nothing
[22:48:29] <RoosterJuice_> if I execute an ajax post with jquery, I want to show the user that it's been executed successfully, where would i find info on how to do that??
[22:48:33] <lazyPower> juha___: pass the glass this way if you'd be so kind.
[22:48:54] <lazyPower> RoosterJuice_: add it to the success property/method of the ajax call
[22:49:09] <lazyPower> ouchhttp://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[22:49:18] <lazyPower> minus the ouch
[22:51:43] <RoosterJuice_> lazyPower, i'm such a noob with jquery.  I'm using the $.post() method, and I dont see any reference to that
[22:51:47] <RoosterJuice_> on this page
[22:52:03] <lazyPower> ?ajax RoosterJuice_
[22:52:11] <bot-t> lazyPower, Thursday, 2011-06-16 - http://services.jquery.com/#jquery_20110616.log.html
[22:52:11] <lazyPower> hrmm
[22:52:43] <RoosterJuice_> lazyPower, maybe I should be using ajax instead of $.post?
[22:52:49] <lazyPower> i dont recall the bots commands, but the ajax methods are pretty much all done through the $.ajax selector
[22:53:51] <RoosterJuice_> http://forum.jquery.com/topic/what-should-i-use-post-vs-ajax
[22:54:39] <RoosterJuice_> so it looks like in my case, since i need to do some custom stuff, i shoudl be using .ajax
[22:59:12] <lazyPower> :)
[23:05:22] <lazyPower> Vorspire: is it possible to align these li images at the bottom instead of middle-align?
[23:05:59] <Vorspire> ?tias
[23:06:00] <bot-t> Try It And See
[23:06:01] <Vorspire> :)
[23:06:09] * lazyPower mutters and grumbles
[23:37:13] <lazyPower> this is so cheap, but it works.. i ended up saying fork it and built an image to set as the bg and gave it some margins.
[23:39:21] <Cianz> hi all i'm having some trouble with the .animate callback
[23:39:28] <Cianz> ive put my code into jsfiddle
[23:39:29] <Cianz> http://jsfiddle.net/tBwjB/
[23:39:43] <Cianz> the problem im having is it wont trigger the callback
[23:39:53] <Cianz> the complete:function part
[23:41:35] <systemfault> Cianz: It does call the complete
[23:41:47] <systemfault> Just add a console.log and you'll see
[23:43:00] <Cianz> so it triggers, but then why doesn't it move .classy to 300px
[23:44:13] <Cianz> it does the first function (go to 150px) but not the second.. visually anyway
[23:48:02] <Cianz> I wanted it to go half way down the box, then once that animation was finished, go to the bottom of the box
