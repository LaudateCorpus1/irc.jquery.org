[16:01:07] <deepy> Samian: confluence does a great job at keeping track of meetings
[16:01:17] <deepy> Samian: but to be fair, confluence does more than just be a wiki

[16:28:26] <gnuvegan> Hi there, How to Change a div element but that is in another file
[16:29:04] <gnuvegan> I tried with that document.getElementById("identification").innerHTML = "whatever";
[16:29:32] <gnuvegan> but I want that the system knows that #identification is a div in another file, is there a way?
[16:29:47] <pavonia> How do you include the other file into the current document?
[16:31:18] <gnuvegan> pavonia,I want a user in a textarea to update a text and it is reflected for another user in the same project but in another page
[16:32:38] <pavonia> You probably want to send the changes via AJAX to the server, or poll for changes for the other user
[17:48:43] <phelix> so on my webpage there is a button for book appointment. Clicking that button creates a popover window..  I wan't to use a custom js script to modify some of the HTML on this window. But seems that my custom jquery can't access the elements on that field. Think because it doesn't show on the page until after the button is pressed.. Is there a way to get this to work?
[17:51:21] <taplar> does the protocol://domain:port of the popover match the page that opened it?
[17:59:48] <phelix> YEs its all in the same page.
[18:00:21] <phelix> Its basically just a popover.. puts transparent item over existing page and has a box with info in it
[18:02:37] <taplar> afaik, if you do something like var x = window.open(....), then you should be able to gain access to the popup's document through the variable
[18:02:52] <phelix> Seems that the javascript on the page runs on page load. But then the popover happens during a later time
[18:03:25] <phelix> Well the problem is there is some other script that handles this popup. Its part of woocommerce popup that gets fired when adding something to cart.
[18:03:37] <phelix> Can I still modify info on this from my own cusotm js file?
[18:05:11] <taplar> not sure.  you might be able to with some usage of https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage  but that would be more on topic for ##javascript
[18:07:02] <phelix> Hmm, interesting.. Never ran into this before.. No idea how to get this to work.
[19:58:56] <jquery580> hey guy im after a signature plugin but one which takes away white blanks on the canvas after...can someone point me  in the right direction please
[22:07:58] <ndss56> hi, is there a better to convert a jquery object to a string? currently, doing alert( $obj1.prop('outerHTML') );
[22:08:12] <ndss56> *better way
[22:12:11] <aFeijo> Hey guys, I need to replace all occurences of 'st', 'nd', 'rd', 'th' from dates. I'm trying to use replace() and regex but regex always boils my mind :( would it be /['th','rd']/g ?
[22:14:18] <ndss56> aFeijo: there is a #regex channel for that
[22:14:37] <aFeijo> got it ! replace(/th|rd|nd|st|,/g, '')
[22:14:44] <aFeijo> thanks anyway ndss56
[22:15:43] <ndss56> aFeijo: what does the /g do?
[22:16:17] <aFeijo> global, all occurences
[22:16:28] <aFeijo> without it it will affect only the first time
[22:16:33] <aFeijo> but in my case, /g aint needed tho
[22:18:03] <ndss56> aFeijo: ok thanks
[22:18:17] <aFeijo> :)
[22:40:20] <ndss56> hi, is there a better way to convert a jquery object to it's string? currently, doing alert( $obj1.prop('outerHTML') );
