[01:22:51] <liquidcms> can anyone tell me why the alert works but the .click doesn't? https://pastebin.com/hQRXw8Yq
[01:28:00] <Woet> liquidcms: www.jsfiddle.net
[01:32:06] <liquidcms> ok, thanks, that will take a while to setup something functional on fiddle.. will try tomorrow
[01:46:05] <liquidcms> https://jsfiddle.net/d6ync88d/4/
[01:47:53] <Cork> liquidcms: you mean the mouseup callback?
[01:48:22] <liquidcms> this code is simply adding to a value to end of the href
[01:48:28] <liquidcms> and the alert shows it added
[01:48:34] <Cork> there is no alert in the jsfiddle
[01:48:41] <liquidcms> but the .click doesnt use the modified href
[01:49:05] <Cork> also you can't trigger the default action on an a tag
[01:49:07] <liquidcms> line 31
[01:49:48] <liquidcms> hmm.. this code works.. it just doesnt use the modified href, it uses the original href
[01:49:51] <Cork> the only option you have is window.location = href
[01:49:57] <liquidcms> no
[01:50:07] <liquidcms> window.location isnt .click
[01:50:12] <Cork> liquidcms: if it works it  works cause the user is clicking the link
[01:50:13] <liquidcms> this opens a modal
[01:50:51] <liquidcms> hmm.. no... i drag and select items.. on mouse up, the .click fires
[01:51:20] <Cork> liquidcms: firstly it isn't cross os safe to expect click to fire after mouseup
[01:51:52] <liquidcms> hmm.. ok.. but you might be right... perhaps it is the mousedown that fires the click but it waits util i have selected.. hmm
[01:51:55] <Cork> 2) elm.click() can't trigger the link default action (none js) it is considered a secure action and can't be triggered though js
[01:52:55] <Cork> if the "modal" you talk about is a javascript inpage element, then ya it can, but then you need to check when that code triggeres
[01:53:00] <Cork> it doesn't in the jsfiddle
[01:54:04] <liquidcms> i removed the .click and it doesnt fire.. so yes, the code works.. but yes, i dont use fiddle.. so likely parts missing
[01:54:48] <liquidcms> so my only question was why doesnt .click use modified href, even thought the alert does
[01:54:57] <liquidcms> but thanks for the suggestions
[01:54:57] <Cork> ya, you need to fiture out what the modal you talk about is, cause we can't really help you if what you show differ a lot from what you use
[01:55:17] <Cork> s/fiture/figure/
[01:55:17] <b-ot> Correction, <Cork> ya, you need to figure out what the modal you talk about is, cause we can't really help you if what you show differ a lot from what you use
[01:55:44] <Cork> and currently it does
[01:56:31] <liquidcms> yea, i cant really build a functional fiddle from everything that is place for this
[01:56:40] <liquidcms> but thanks anyways.. i'll keep looking
[01:57:01] <Cork> you don't need to for everything
[01:57:12] <Cork> but the related code needs to behave the same
[01:57:27] <liquidcms> right
[01:57:44] <Cork> so in this case a substitute event.preventDefault(); <something> needs to trigger on something clicking somewhere
[01:57:52] <liquidcms> its part of a cms.. so not sure what all libs are installed for the modal
[01:58:28] <Cork> if it uses jquery you can check around with $._data(elm, 'events')
[01:58:34] <liquidcms> possibly i need to call modal directly.. rather than "click"
[01:58:45] <Cork> possibly
[01:58:56] <Cork> depends on how it triggers
[02:45:33] <vb0x3f> I'm using window.prompt for getting input. It opens again after user enters a value. This is happening only in Chrome and not in Firefox
[02:45:47] <vb0x3f> any idea why?
[02:47:02] <Woet> i have no idea why thats a #jquery question, no
[03:23:35] <itsgokul> help scrollHeight of iframe stays same after content inside reduces
[03:29:58] <Cork> itsgokul: is the iframe cross origin?
[03:30:05] <itsgokul> no
[03:30:20] <Cork> then you have to grab the document inside the iframe
[03:31:03] <Cork> $('iframe').contents().prop('scrollHeight') (if i remember correctly)
[03:31:40] <itsgokul> i have content inside iframe using ajax
[03:32:49] <itsgokul> so im using eventlistener to set height using scrollheight if i select per page 25 from 50 its not reducing
[03:33:15] <itsgokul> but it works from 25 to 50
[04:35:04] <querryLoT> Hi, try to get first month an class of active ---> https://jsfiddle.net/Lj6nv68m/
[04:37:37] <cannap> whi what
[04:38:14] <Cork> querryLoT: so basically what you want is $('.calendar-box').each(function(e, i) { if(i == 0) {} })?
[04:38:58] <Cork> or what is the actual goal here?
[04:39:59] <querryLoT> to get an class of each first month
[04:40:08] <Cork> "class of"?
[04:40:11] <Cork> what class?
[04:40:17] <querryLoT> .active
[04:40:26] <Cork> so get or add?
[04:40:33] <querryLoT> add
[04:40:54] <Cork> ok, so you want to add "active" to what elements?
[04:42:40] <querryLoT> to every first element that has new month
[04:43:29] <querryLoT> so only first element that has January should have class active, and also feb, mars, ...
[04:44:04] <Cork> and also??
[04:44:09] <Cork> so to every element?
[04:44:25] <querryLoT> this how result will look like: --> https://jsfiddle.net/Lj6nv68m/4/
[04:44:58] <Cork> ah, so to every element where the previous month isn't the same as the one in it
[04:45:04] <querryLoT> now I have put the active classes in html where they should be with help of jquery
[04:45:16] <querryLoT> yes :)
[04:45:33] <querryLoT> sorry if I wasnt explaining to well :/
[04:48:39] <Cork> querryLoT: i would prob do it as https://jsfiddle.net/Lj6nv68m/11/
[04:49:29] <querryLoT> is there any way to get data-month inside with jquery?
[04:49:37] <Cork> (cleaned up) https://jsfiddle.net/Lj6nv68m/13/
[04:49:42] <Cork> sure
[04:49:49] <Cork> $(this).data('month')
[04:50:28] <querryLoT> so I dont have to put it directly in HTML
[04:50:38] <Cork> i would recommend doing so
[04:50:57] <Cork> else you will have to have to parse the text in the elements
[04:51:09] <Cork> and hope a space or upercase or something comes in there
[04:51:27] <Cork> (or the content gets translated)
[04:51:39] <querryLoT> ok, thx, will try
[04:51:40] <Cork> it is normally better to keep data out of content if possible
[10:36:34] <z1haze> anyone used jquery-ui datepicker - I'm trying to create a datepicker that has no date selected by default
[10:53:04] <z1haze> i dont think its possible (using an inline date picker)
[10:58:02] <AdamPDotty> guess you would have to undo the styles for Date before first selection.
[10:58:15] <z1haze> O.o?
[11:00:34] <AdamPDotty> redefine styles for ui-state-default
[11:13:09] <z1haze> styles != data
[13:05:41] <guide_X> any idea why this explodes in error console.log($('input[type="search"]').val());
[13:06:01] <guide_X> on line 1865 of jquery  I get throw new Error("Syntax error, unrecognized expression: " + msg);
[13:06:08] <guide_X> v1.10.2
[13:08:18] <robertmaxrees> guide_X https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r039amrL/1/
[13:08:20] <robertmaxrees> seems fine here.
[13:08:31] <guide_X> oh hm
[13:08:45] <robertmaxrees> would need to see more to help.
[13:09:21] <guide_X> hmm this is a different jquery though
[13:10:10] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r039amrL/3/
[13:10:11] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[13:11:06] <robertmaxrees> are you actually passing that specific string or are you trying to build it somehow?>
[13:11:59] <guide_X> well the actual javascript is 'console.log($('input[type="search"]').val());' and the actual object is dynamically created, and looks like '<input type="search" class="form-control" placeholder="Search" aria-controls="datatable-details"'
[13:12:13] <guide_X> I'm testing outside the project real quick...
[13:12:20] <robertmaxrees> mind updating the fiddle to be a little more indicative?
[13:12:29] <guide_X> yes I'm working on that atm
[13:12:49] <robertmaxrees> rad.
[13:16:22] <guide_X> oh hrm, this works outside the project, strange
[13:16:43] <robertmaxrees> you sure the line you're looking at is the actual problem?
[13:16:44] <guide_X> with the same jquery and all
[13:17:46] <robertmaxrees> something tells me the issue is where you're creating the element.
[13:17:59] <guide_X> well that's part of the problem, it's datatables
[13:18:08] <guide_X> I'm not exactly creating the search field
[13:18:21] <robertmaxrees> what are you passing to it?
[13:18:29] <guide_X> some text from another textbox
[13:18:44] <guide_X> trying to set the text, because the datatable one is in the wrong spot, I have another textbox doing the work etc
[13:18:49] <robertmaxrees> what's that text?
[13:18:55] <guide_X> just some blah blah stuff
[13:19:02] <guide_X> 123 test blah etc
[13:19:11] <robertmaxrees> because the error suggests you're passing in some bad markup.
[13:19:19] <guide_X> oic ok, well i'll check for that
[13:21:39] <guide_X> aha, it cannot find it
[13:21:47] <guide_X> because it's created dynamically
[13:21:58] <guide_X> I need to bind or find or something
[13:22:03] <guide_X> well thanks!
[13:23:12] <robertmaxrees> "bind or find or something"?
[13:24:30] <guide_X> yeah jquery can't find this element, sometimes I can use "find" or something else to find it
[13:24:42] <guide_X> ("realelement").find("dynamicelement") etc
[13:24:59] <guide_X> or seeming
[13:25:00] <guide_X> ly
[13:25:27] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:25:35] <robertmaxrees> that shouldn't make a difference.
[14:24:50] <z1haze> why in the world does jquery-ui datepicker make a default date selection when you inline the datepicker, but if you put it on an input, the there is no default.. so freakin dumb
[14:25:00] <z1haze> you shouldnt be forced to select a default date
[14:27:09] <taplar> inline the date picker?
[14:27:43] <z1haze> yeah
[14:28:01] <z1haze> https://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#inline
[14:28:46] <taplar> so, what are you not wanting it to default to the current date?
[14:28:54] <z1haze> i dont want any default date
[14:29:00] <taplar> so where should it start?
[14:29:09] <z1haze> the same way it starts for the normal datepicker
[14:29:10] <z1haze> unselected
[14:30:51] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/60hq8ode/1/ look
[14:30:55] <z1haze> see how it forces a default date
[14:31:07] <taplar> yeah, interesting
[14:31:40] <z1haze> better comparison https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/60hq8ode/2/
[14:35:27] <z1haze> https://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/60hq8ode/8/
[14:35:31] <z1haze> im not missing anything, am i?
[14:35:52] <taplar> i found this page about it: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3668325/jquery-datepicker-no-default-date
[14:36:47] <z1haze> yeah, just clearing the altfield
[14:36:50] <z1haze> but then i thought of this
[14:36:58] <z1haze> what happens if the user really did want to pick the default date
[14:37:02] <z1haze> which its already set to on the UI
[14:37:07] <z1haze> but then we tell them its not set?
[14:38:33] <taplar> *shrug*  more of a UX case study of your app at that point
[14:39:00] <taplar> i'm assuming you are trying to not show the current date as a default because some one said it's a problem
[14:40:04] <z1haze> well the owner just wants to make sure we force the custom to pick a date
[14:40:21] <z1haze> and be able to show them an error mesage to pick a date vs showing them a error message that their date is too soon
[14:41:13] <taplar> so if you remove the highlight on open, and the alt input is blank, if they never click one of the dates, the alt input should still be blank for you to validate against
[14:48:02] <z1haze> you cant remove the selected date though
[14:48:36] <taplar> the highlighting?
[14:49:07] <taplar> or do you mean in the case that the alt field actually has a date in it
[14:57:36] <z1haze> well the highlighting and the alt field go hand in hand
[15:41:58] <taplar> z1haze: best i've come up with is to revert the styling.  https://jsfiddle.net/60hq8ode/15/
[15:42:39] <z1haze> ah thats a though
[15:42:46] <z1haze> what a hack though, right?
[15:42:53] <taplar> yeah, kinda weird
[17:49:07] <Guest34148> is it possible to extend timeout
[17:49:19] <Guest34148> to add more time to it
[17:49:52] <robertmaxrees> what kind of timeout?
[17:50:10] <Guest34148> setTimeout
[17:50:36] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7798680/add-duration-to-js-settimeout-after-the-timer-is-running
[17:50:42] <robertmaxrees> though i'd ask why you're using settimeout at all.
[18:03:50] <grapheti> Just set your timeout to Infinity
[18:04:16] <grapheti> ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
[18:08:32] <Guest34148> smart
[18:51:52] <mrush> is the 'else {return false}' here necessary? ==> let is_once = (name,suffix) => {if($('.' +name +suffix).length) {return true} else {return false}}
[18:52:22] <mrush> or will if return false imlicitly
[18:52:30] <mrush> s/ml/mpl/
[18:52:31] <b-ot> Correction, <mrush> or will if return false implicitly
[18:56:28] <pavonia> Why not "return $('.' +name +suffix).length > 0;"?
[18:58:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:58:57] <robertmaxrees> also: 0 is falsy
[19:04:23] <mrush> pavonia, robertmaxrees, even better. thanks!
[19:34:27] <mrush> victory! https://jsfiddle.net/m26bLrod/17/
[19:36:34] <robertmaxrees> btw you don't need html/head/body tags in fiddles :)
[19:36:55] <mrush> :D
[19:38:13] <mrush> robertmaxrees: this is my first attempt at using functional paradigm
