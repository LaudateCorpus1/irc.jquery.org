[02:55:11] <Sandlayth> hello guys
[02:59:52] <Sandlayth> how could i refactor this automatically? http://sprunge.us/ZGHf?json
[03:00:01] <Sandlayth> i mean, i retrieve it from a db
[03:00:26] <Sandlayth> and i would like to merge the elements which share the same "idPizza" value
[03:19:10] <Sandlayth> i finally found http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26977121/sort-and-merge-json-keys-with-matching-values
[03:19:38] <Sandlayth> thus i've to do it manually
[11:18:42] <Caspan_> Doing some math with Jquery anf getting some weird results
[11:18:57] <Caspan_> like 58 + 42 and i am getting 99.9999999999
[11:18:59] <Caspan_> ??
[11:19:13] <Caspan_> i know i can use .toFixed(2) on it
[11:19:42] <Caspan_> but how is it screwing up suck simple math? am i dong something wrong to produce this result?
[11:19:52] <Caspan_> such simple math*
[11:21:41] <Caspan_> sorry it was 1458.57 + 109.07 = 1567.6399999999999
[11:22:18] <Woet> Caspan_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3439040/why-does-adding-two-decimals-in-javascript-produce-a-wrong-result
[11:22:28] <Caspan_> thanks
[11:22:45] <Caspan_> yeah it seems like tis only with decimals
[11:24:13] <Caspan_> I cannot believe this is an issue lol
[11:24:22] <Caspan_> wow never knew
[11:25:48] <shoky> it's not an issue ;) you just don't use regular floating point types for precise decimal calculations, you use a decimal type, or a library that provides one
[11:26:00] <shoky> e.g. decimal.js
[11:30:23] <Caspan_> So when you are reading from HTML the numbers how do you convert that to regular floating types
[11:30:37] <Caspan_> ii am adding all the columns of a table to get the total
[11:30:40] <Caspan_> I am
[11:31:01] <Caspan_> i am using JQuery to select them then sum them up as it goes in a function
[11:32:03] <Caspan_> so instead of using Number($('#UnpaidTable .TableTotal').html() || 0).toFixed(2)
[11:32:13] <Caspan_> is there a better way to treat them as floats?
[11:32:46] <shoky> i said you *don't* use regular floating point types for precise calculations ;p
[11:33:00] <shoky> not sure what you're asking
[11:33:04] <Caspan_> ahh
[11:33:13] <Caspan_> sorry
[11:33:22] <Caspan_> I want to add money
[11:33:37] <Caspan_> is there a better way to do it 2.34 + 10.23
[11:33:47] <shoky> then use a library for decimal calculations e.g decimal.js
[11:33:52] <Caspan_> ok
[11:33:53] <shoky> if you need precision
[11:34:20] <Caspan_> well i want maney to not be rounded when it shouldent be :)
[11:34:41] <Caspan_> i guess i can just toFixed(2) that will make sure its right
[11:35:03] <Caspan_> its close enough that when i use that it will give me a proper result
[11:35:25] <Caspan_> just learning and understanding.. i guess for money I dont need precision like that
[11:35:49] <shoky> heh.. usually money is where people do need that precision ;p
[11:36:06] <Caspan_> well 34.4599999999999999   will be precise enough to round up
[11:36:30] <Caspan_> its normally close enough that toFixed will round it properly
[11:36:57] <Caspan_> sorry not close enough but is so close to the precise number
[11:37:29] <Caspan_> thank you for your help!
[13:32:08] <ArmitaageDS> Hello. I'm a bit of a rookie to jquery(too many parenthesis, personal ideology) and I've run into an issue with jquery ui autocomplete. I'm trying to use a remote data source for my list. I know I'm missing something simple, but why isn't the code at pastebin.com/162E6829 actually offer any suggestions to the user? I know for a fact that it is successfully sending the request to the server and that the server is responding with a j
[13:57:52] <shoky> ArmitaageDS your message got cut off after "server is responding with a j..."
[14:00:13] <ArmitaageDS> Shoky the last part is "server is responding with a json array that contains a label and a value for each object"
[14:05:09] <shoky> ArmitaageDS i don't see anything wrong with your code.. will need to see a jsfiddle or testcase reproducing the issue
[14:05:50] <ArmitaageDS> Sample output of the server url at https://pastebin.com/P340bmAk
[14:06:13] <shoky> ArmitaageDS: that's not valid JSON
[14:06:38] <ArmitaageDS> Ah, I see. What should it look like?
[14:07:05] <shoky> keys must be quoted.. you shouldn't be building json manually.
[14:07:35] <ArmitaageDS> So "label" : "something"?
[14:07:49] <shoky> yes. but again, you should not be building json manually :)
[14:08:00] <shoky> that's what computers are for ;p
[14:08:52] <shoky> e.g. in JS you can just use JSON.stringify to build json. whatever backend you're using definitely has its own json stringifier too
[14:09:15] <ArmitaageDS> Ok, thanks. I blame the stackexchange answer I was looking at. It didn't have the keys quoted, so...â€‹
[14:10:16] <shoky> doesn't seem like you're listening, but ok :)
[14:12:57] <ArmitaageDS> No, I understand. I will look to improve the code more properly.

[21:54:43] <GanzAndere> Hello my friendly neighbourhood spidermen
[21:55:22] <GanzAndere> https://paste2.org/0kkUhkOh <- I have a function which I am stupid about writing it this way. Too many if conditions and with more entries, it will continue to grow and become  horrible to manage. How can rewrite this funky func to make it better?
[21:55:25] <GanzAndere> Thank you :)
[21:56:43] <GanzAndere> Perhaps the function can take argument? the argument would be mp3 file name (minus the extention) and I can use that for uhm... class name.
[21:56:52] <GanzAndere> Then i'd have to call the function 4 times, That's probably more easy to manage?
[21:56:58] <GanzAndere> am I thinking this correctly?
[21:57:41] <GanzAndere> anyone home?
