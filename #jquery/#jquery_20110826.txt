[00:02:08] <TrueColors> Having a slight problem. http://jsfiddle.net/BQscm/ it's set so that $("form#form2") is a fade, but it slides. Strange thing is... remove that line, so it only has $("form#form1").descs ... it'll still slide with the form2.
[00:02:09] <TrueColors> not sure why
[00:02:27] <TrueColors> along with that, click the second textbox, then click off of it.. and back on. you shall see the box on the right is like.. miles away
[00:15:26] <ebryn> sup brah
[00:20:21] <Flip_> Hi
[00:20:31] <TrueColors> How do I check if an element is being animated.
[00:20:50] <TrueColors> actually
[00:20:51] <TrueColors> nevermind
[00:21:38] <Flip_> $("#test").css("background-image").replaceWith("url(myimage.jpg)");    gives me "...is not a function". Why?
[00:22:25] <jomofcw> Flip_ $("#test").css("background-image","url(myimage.jpg)")
[00:22:35] <jomofcw> replaceWith is to replace DOM element
[00:22:51] <jomofcw> ? replaceWith()
[00:22:51] <bot-t1> .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[00:23:44] <Flip_> @jomofc:  Ah, I see. Works perfectly, thanks
[00:23:48] <jomofcw> In place of css('name') return you the value of the name property.
[00:23:55] <jomofcw> Np Flip_ =).
[00:33:55] <chovy> is it possible to process a continuous stream of json data with jQuery?
[00:34:20] <chovy> $.getJSON('/stream', function(d){}); does not ever return.
[00:34:27] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[00:34:58] <fructose> I've been in the habit of using .each() if I wanted to do the same thing to every element in an array, but I'm finding that I can just apply it to the array and it applies to each element. Is there a reason not to do that?
[00:35:05] <Double_Rainbow> how do i make a condition to check if a field has a number that is less than 4, then true, else false?
[00:35:28] <chovy> Double_Rainbow: huh?
[00:35:52] <chovy> this['name'].value
[00:35:52] <chovy> ?
[00:36:09] <fructose> e.g. $('#foo').children(':input').attr('disabled','disabled') seems to do the same thing as if I did $('#foo').children(':input').each(... etc...);
[00:36:13] <Double_Rainbow> if ($("#nombre_enfants").val() < 4 )
[00:36:18] <Double_Rainbow> got it
[00:37:46] <glaksmono> what is the event handler that could handle when the user is typing on a textbox?
[00:38:00] <Merbster> glaksmono, keyup can be used
[00:38:13] <Double_Rainbow> .change?
[00:38:28] <Merbster> Double_Rainbow, change only gets triggered on boxes where you actually select something.
[00:38:43] <Double_Rainbow> no shit!
[00:39:12] <Merbster> typing in text in a textbox does not trigger change
[00:39:23] <jomofcw> glaksmono keydown, change
[00:39:40] <jomofcw> keyup will be better than keydown
[00:40:40] <chovy> Does anyone know how to process a stream like this with jQuery?

[00:42:47] <extendus> I´m using two jquery sliders from slidesjs.com on my page. The second slider is hidden on load. When toggling the second slider a second time, the frame becomes empty. However the first slider acts normal. I´ve put up a test at http://test.extendus.se/
[00:45:04] <fructose> Is it safe to do $('#foo').children(':input').attr('disabled','disabled'); and assume all inputs are disabled? I thought .each() was required. Any docs/keywords to explain would also be helpful.
[00:45:58] <rajeshp> hi I'm trying to put an expandable tree list on my form, which will have select boxes, as well as select all or un select all, can some one point me to any written plugins
[00:49:47] <nisseni> I'm using jQuery validate. However, in Sweden we often use comma as decimal divider. So I would like for the function to interpret comma as . - any ideas about this?
[00:54:03] <murrrley> nisseni: I've got no experience with jquery validate, but you could try checking the input before passing it on the method and replacing a comma (if found) with a period?
[00:54:49] <nisseni> murrrley: yeah, my thaught exactly, however, I'm very novice with jquery, so it's how to do just that, that would be the question :)
[00:56:54] <murrrley> Just regular javascript replace method should do: document.write(variablex.replace(",","."));
[00:58:07] <murrrley> without the document.write ofc.... I suck at copy/pasting  :<
[00:59:41] <nisseni> in the validate function you mean?
[01:08:29] <farhad2161> how can i raise an event when the text of a label is changed by $('#element').text('sometext')
[01:08:52] <coldhead> you can't, farhad2161
[01:09:13] <farhad2161> coldhead: are u sure?
[01:09:22] <coldhead> i've never ever seen it done
[01:09:39] <coldhead> the closest thing you can do is have whatever changes the text trigger some custom event
[01:09:43] <coldhead> and bind to that
[01:10:03] <farhad2161> give me a sample
[01:10:15] <farhad2161> coldhead: give me a sample
[01:10:56] <blackspotwiggins> farhad2161, if you do .text() you can trigger whatever you want by yourself
[01:11:25] <farhad2161> blackspotwiggins: give me a sample plz
[01:11:29] <coldhead> farhad2161: no you give ME a sample
[01:11:36] <coldhead> of your sweet sweet eye juice
[01:11:40] <blackspotwiggins> $("#element").text("what"); dosomethingelse(); ?
[01:12:35] <farhad2161> blackspotwiggins: i have so many $("#element").text("what");  :(
[01:12:57] <blackspotwiggins> so?
[01:12:57] <Lampoon> so are you
[01:13:05] <juha_> coldie! how's austria treating you today?
[01:13:11] <farhad2161> farhad2161: adding  dosomethingelse(); after all of them is so hard

[01:13:31] <blackspotwiggins> farhad2161, ever heard of loops?
[01:13:33] <coldhead> juha_: too bloody warm
[01:14:44] <juha_> coldhead: you should move to a higher ground, have you considered the alps?
[01:15:38] <farhad2161> blackspotwiggins: loops! it means for,while,do ?
[01:15:40] <coldhead> i yearn for them
[01:15:55] <blackspotwiggins> farhad2161, omg. dude
[01:15:59] <blackspotwiggins> select all the elements
[01:16:04] <blackspotwiggins> use .each on the collection
[01:16:09] <blackspotwiggins> that hard?

[01:20:16] <blackspotwiggins> farhad2161, that's really up to you, isn't it?
[01:20:43] <farhad2161> blackspotwiggins: yes,but need help
[01:22:34] <blackspotwiggins> you need help to think what you need it for?
[01:22:42] <blackspotwiggins> sorry, out of my league
[01:22:47] <murrrley> nisseni: yeah, I suppose. Or you could write the replace method to run before the form is actually submitted, should a comma be found?
[01:23:10] <farhad2161> blackspotwiggins: what is your idea about overridin .text() method ?
[01:23:18] <blackspotwiggins> none?
[01:23:40] <blackspotwiggins> why would .text() have to be overridden
[01:24:14] <farhad2161> when text() is raised automatically call dosomething()
[01:24:20] <farhad2161> blackspotwiggins: when text() is raised automatically call dosomething()
[01:25:01] <blackspotwiggins> you dont want that
[01:25:06] <blackspotwiggins> for every .text()
[01:25:40] <rahmen> Hi! I've made an ajax post request where my data is just a table. Code here: http://pastebin.com/kFP21j5q As you can see there's no variables. How do I make this request in html? Another solution would be if I could make the client do this exact request itself.
[01:25:45] <farhad2161> blackspotwiggins: or extend the method for some elements
[01:27:11] <rahmen> ... instead of letting ajax do the request I want the client to go there with the same post request.
[01:28:30] <blackspotwiggins> farhad2161, ffs just call whatever you need after you call text() is it so hard?!
[01:29:55] <farhad2161> blackspotwiggins: i have a master page and about 20 other pages that belongs to master page
[01:30:29] <farhad2161> blackspotwiggins: any label change in this pages must call a function in master page
[01:31:05] <farhad2161> blackspotwiggins: and there is no event for label change
[01:31:22] <coldhead> i think someone mentioned that a half hour ago or so
[01:31:24] <Trisox> blackspotwiggins: hallo
[01:31:31] <Trisox> blackspotwiggins: how your doing
[01:31:39] <TrueColors> http://pastebin.com/ST54R3Mi I'm looking for a better way to write this. It's more or less the var name, being so long and bulky.
[01:31:48] <Trisox> blackspotwiggins: you have a funny name
[01:31:48] <blackspotwiggins> Trisox, rebecca black in da hauss!!!
[01:31:51] <Trisox> ;)
[01:35:05] <TrueColors> Kinda funny.
[01:35:14] <TrueColors> The guys who pick on rebecca black, are like much older than 13.
[01:36:48] <sasori> need help, is there something wrong with my code ? why it displays the "loginpopup" div box twice ? :( http://pastebin.com/xhbBeLDj
[01:43:56] <anli_> sasori: hard to say, that ajax really needs some break out of code
[01:44:02] <anli_> the ajax call
[01:45:13] <sasori> hmmn..lemme try 1 sec..if commenting it would help
[01:45:26] <anli_> ah, not commenting in the first place
[01:45:32] <anli_> The problem is the mass
[01:45:38] <anli_> The heavy weight
[01:45:42] <anli_> of text
[01:46:04] <coldhead> do you know what i'm tired of?
[01:46:08] <coldhead> the hatred and the lies
[01:46:25] <anli_> sasori: I would not build a string but send an object instead
[01:46:46] <anli_> coldhead: how can that be so tiresome?
[01:46:48] <Behl> Hi there. I'm creating a jQuery plugin and I want to expose some data from inside the plugin to the user, when they call my callback. Is it simply enough to have the plugin do a return, and if it is, how do I then access that data from the 'user' point of view?
[01:48:17] <mattyh88> hey, i'm trying to load boxy with <a class='boxy' ...> but it goes to the next page instead of showing me the boxy popup window. why would that be? the boxy initiator is set as well
[01:48:40] <anli_> sasori: the idea: http://pastebin.com/index/xhbBeLDj
[01:48:58] <anli_> hm, strange, must be wrong
[01:49:01] <anli_> Cant see the changes
[01:49:56] <sasori> anli_: http://pastebin.com/index/xhbBeLDj i tried commenting the ajax part
[01:50:13] <anli_> sasori: http://pastebin.com/CJNGhzS8
[01:50:24] <anli_> sasori: check how much lighter that code became
[01:50:30] <_bart> Hi, someone might remember me asking how to divide a long chunk of html into multiple pieces of a specific height, I wrote the js for it, so if anyone is interested, just let me know :)
[01:51:14] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, show me
[01:51:45] <anli_> sasori: I see no comments in the last paste
[01:52:05] <_bart> blackspotwiggins: this shows the essence: http://jsbin.com/oyejil/edit#javascript,html,live
[01:53:29] <sasori> anli_: didn't helped :( , i tried the last pastebin ,
[01:53:34] <_bart> blackspotwiggins: It's now able to split up the <p> if they're too long. This is obviously not the entire script, I wrote this for a "ePub to html pages" app but this shows the basic stuff.
[01:54:05] <anli_> sasori: I was more aiming for you looking at it, I dont know why the dialog comes up twice as I said
[01:54:21] <anli_> I was only interested in pointing out that the ajax call was a bit heavy
[01:54:34] <Jammsen> Hi guys
[01:55:13] <Jammsen> is there a possibility to check if there an <a> element inside a span via jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/tPmpS/9/
[01:55:19] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, that example should split to 400px ?
[01:55:22] <sasori> anli_: but regardless of the ajax call, any idea why it pops up twice the loginpopup div ? , i even checked the headers of the page, it calls the ui js once
[01:55:34] <anli_> no ideas at all
[01:55:43] <anli_> Try putting an alert box there
[01:55:53] <anli_> See if it comes up twice when you press the button
[01:55:58] <aaronmcadam> console.log not alert
[01:56:00] <sasori> ok
[01:56:03] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, the first one is 342px and second 475px
[01:56:06] <_bart> blackspotwiggins: Yes, it loops through the html untill it finds the point where it's passing the 400px and then it tries to cut it off.
[01:56:31] <_bart> umm, let me check :)
[01:56:55] <aaronmcadam> Jammsen: you could try if ( $('span').find('a').length ) { there is an a el inside a span here .... }
[01:57:18] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, looks way more complex than it should tbh
[01:57:58] <_bart> blackspotwiggins: well I think that's the reason why there are not really alot of scripts available doing this I guess?
[01:58:16] <blackspotwiggins> it's not that useful IMO
[01:58:17] <aaronmcadam> doing what?
[01:58:30] <aaronmcadam> there's a few doing equal height divs
[01:58:37] <coldhead> heya aaronmcadam
[01:58:38] <blackspotwiggins> if you add layout more complex, it will break
[01:58:39] <Jammsen> aaronmcadam:     if ($('span').find('a').length) {         alert('jo');     } matches on <div class="np_layer_controlls">     <div class="innerLeft">         <div class="pagination">             <span>«</span> without an <a>
[01:58:40] <aaronmcadam> but what are u trying to do
[01:58:44] <aaronmcadam> yo coldhead
[01:58:45] <blackspotwiggins> any images, anything
[01:58:55] <_bart> it's preproccessing my ePub files for my ebook reader
[01:59:08] <rahmen> How do I do this: http://pastebin.com/kFP21j5q but in html? (notice that data is just a string (the post body) and not variables (inputs))
[01:59:12] <_bart> yes I'm aware of its limitations
[01:59:13] <aaronmcadam> wtf Jammsen lol
[01:59:37] <aaronmcadam> that can't be right
[01:59:38] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, not to discourage you, but reflowing text is pretty hard
[01:59:55] <Jammsen> aaronmcadam: sorry im starter, http://jsfiddle.net/tPmpS/12/
[01:59:58] <aaronmcadam> make the selector more specific anyway
[02:00:02] <Jammsen> try it
[02:00:12] <_bart> blackspotwiggins: yes, but I'm almost there, the limitations you mentioned do not apply for my application so..
[02:00:33] <_bart> blackspotwiggins: also, I wonder how other people do it, any articles?
[02:00:43] <aaronmcadam> what's up coldhead did u want help with somethin man?
[02:00:48] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, not sure
[02:01:17] <coldhead> no aaronmcadam, i am just respectfully greeting you
[02:01:23] <coldhead> won't happen again, sorry sorry sorry
[02:01:25] <aaronmcadam> haha cool
[02:01:28] <coldhead> time is monet etc
[02:01:32] <aaronmcadam> haha i'm not complainin lol
[02:01:54] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, i'd approach it differently tho
[02:02:17] <_bart> blackspotwiggins: how would you approach it?
[02:02:44] <blackspotwiggins> take all the text that needs to be split
[02:03:31] <blackspotwiggins> based on some stats figure out, what the average word count would be for set line length and block height and add that many
[02:04:01] <blackspotwiggins> add/take away to get to a reasonable tolerance of it, then start again until text runs out
[02:04:11] <_bart> blackspotwiggins: would that work with different font families?
[02:04:23] <blackspotwiggins> no
[02:04:52] <_bart> I mean, it'd be great if this was possible with just Ruby or something local, not in a browser, but to do this accurately you have to render it to check the height I guess?
[02:05:07] <blackspotwiggins> you cant do it anywhere except the browser
[02:05:16] <blackspotwiggins> given how fonts are different everywhere
[02:06:38] <DarsVaeda1> is there any downside of including two js files that both implement a $.ready();?
[02:07:09] <_bart> so annoying, everyone should be forced to use Courier
[02:07:21] <blackspotwiggins> DarsVaeda1, no
[02:07:24] <aaronmcadam> there's no problem having multiple readys DarsVaeda1
[02:07:31] <michael_> Hey I'm looking for a way to submit a file and textinput via jquery any examples i can take a look at or any suggestions? couldn't find any docs about it
[02:07:33] <DarsVaeda1> okay thanks :)
[02:07:44] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, because reading ebooks in courier is so pleasant, right?
[02:08:18] <_bart> blackspotwiggins: that'd feel quite retro I think, and retro is the cool thing nowadays or not? :)
[02:08:30] <_bart> like someone wrote it on an old machine.
[02:08:37] <aaronmcadam> _bart have u looked at other projects like pdf.js?
[02:08:48] <blackspotwiggins> there's a reason kerning went popular as well ;)
[02:10:31] <_bart> aaronmcadam: I haven't, I don't like javascript that much.
[02:10:40] <aaronmcadam> wtf???
[02:10:50] <aaronmcadam> gtfo then lol jk
[02:10:50] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, i noticed your code style is not very js-like
[02:12:14] <aaronmcadam> _bart, it's very impressive, here's a demo: http://people.mozilla.org/~gal/test.html
[02:12:24] <_bart> blackspotwiggins: yes, probably. I hope this script will work as planned and I can move back to obj-C and Ruby. :)
[02:12:53] <aaronmcadam> _bart: github repo: https://github.com/andreasgal/pdf.js
[02:13:06] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, doesnt look much like ruby either. maybe C then
[02:13:06] <aaronmcadam> http://andreasgal.com/2011/06/15/pdf-js/
[02:13:32] <aaronmcadam> obj c is almost unrecognisable compared to c blackspotwiggins
[02:13:34] <natrixnatrix89> is it possible to set z-index, not using $(element).css('z-index', value); but using the array?
[02:13:43] <aaronmcadam> have you ever written any?
[02:13:58] <natrixnatrix89> I mean like .css({display: 'block', z-index: value});
[02:14:11] <natrixnatrix89> but z-index would not be a good var name..
[02:14:12] <blackspotwiggins> nope, the syntax and the environment are too horrible
[02:14:17] <natrixnatrix89> what do Iuse then?
[02:14:30] <_bart> I use it in xcode4 for my app.
[02:14:38] <aaronmcadam> it's completely alien
[02:14:46] <_bart> the syntax is quite odd, that's true.
[02:15:16] <aaronmcadam> i wrote a no sleep phonegap plugin with it
[02:15:57] <aaronmcadam> turned out to be quite simple but was very strange
[02:16:34] <_bart> 2 more days till school :)
[02:17:01] <DarsVaeda1> school...that brings up memories
[02:17:09] <aaronmcadam> wha?
[02:17:13] <aaronmcadam> ur still in school?
[02:17:17] <dr0id> yes
[02:17:18] <aaronmcadam> do u mean uni?
[02:17:24] <dr0id> no, school
[02:17:34] <aaronmcadam> are you _Bart? droid :P
[02:17:35] <_bart> Im 18, studying physics
[02:18:05] <aaronmcadam> so ur ebook reader is a pet projecT?
[02:18:36] <_bart> a writer of a book asked me personally to create it for his book specifically.
[02:18:42] <aaronmcadam> ah cool
[02:19:00] <DarsVaeda1> what platform?
[02:19:04] <_bart> iPad.
[02:19:07] <aaronmcadam> well I advise u to look at that pdf.js project even tho u don't like js
[02:19:18] <DarsVaeda1> from scratch or did you use some library to parse the files?
[02:19:30] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, go native on this one, trust me
[02:19:30] <aaronmcadam> can't u do it native _bart u said u know objc
[02:19:49] <aaronmcadam> hehe great minds :D
[02:19:53] <_bart> But turned out to be quite hard since this is my first xcode project ever.
[02:20:03] <aaronmcadam> oh really.. shite
[02:20:06] <_bart> I use 6 UIWebViews
[02:20:08] <dr0id> im also 18, earning money
[02:20:13] <blackspotwiggins> wtf,
[02:20:15] <_bart> They turn in 3d space (yay).
[02:20:23] <aaronmcadam> dr0id: what u workin on?
[02:20:26] <DarsVaeda1> I'm considering writing one for android as no reader hits my needs yet
[02:20:26] <blackspotwiggins> you use web controls for native apps?
[02:20:33] <_bart> And they load the pages of the epub (which is actually a zip containing xhtml)
[02:20:39] <blackspotwiggins> + there is a perfectly good reader for ipad
[02:20:50] <blackspotwiggins> you are most likely not going to beat that in quality
[02:20:57] <aaronmcadam> course not
[02:20:59] <_bart> blackspotwiggins: true, but it doesn't do what my app does.
[02:21:10] <blackspotwiggins> show not very well formed epubs?
[02:21:11] <dr0id> I am not workin today - sorry.
[02:21:12] <aaronmcadam> why don't u extend somethin else
[02:21:25] <aaronmcadam> haha I mean what do u do dr0id
[02:21:40] <dr0id> build web applications, mostly business apps :)
[02:21:48] <_bart> blackspotwiggings: it contains audio files (audiobook) and videos.
[02:21:49] <aaronmcadam> platform?
[02:21:56] <_bart> and he wanted to publish it in the appstore.
[02:22:04] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, oh god
[02:22:09] <blackspotwiggins> good luck, you'll need it
[02:22:34] <_bart> no worries, already worked on it for 4 weeks now. :)
[02:22:42] <_bart> got it running in TestFlight already.
[02:22:55] <dr0id> LAMP
[02:22:56] <aaronmcadam> tried to use that a few months ago
[02:23:00] <blackspotwiggins> imagine for a minute what the end user will see
[02:23:05] <aaronmcadam> was to beta to be useful lol
[02:23:10] <blackspotwiggins> sitting in his edgy clothes in a starbucks
[02:23:22] <blackspotwiggins> they have used the native reader app and like it
[02:23:28] <aaronmcadam> with smug all over his face lol
[02:23:40] <blackspotwiggins> then you show up with this not very well made reader that has VIDEOS and AUDIO
[02:23:48] <blackspotwiggins> and it's slow and kludgy and uses courier
[02:23:49] <_bart> blackspotwiggings: yes I understand your point and maybe you are right.
[02:23:50] <aaronmcadam> that's a bit strange
[02:24:00] <blackspotwiggins> he will quit it, never look at it again
[02:24:02] <_bart> but pretty hard to just throw away a month of work, he wouldn't like that.
[02:24:10] <aaronmcadam> do u have a spec?
[02:24:20] <_bart> what's a spec (I'm not english)?
[02:24:32] <aaronmcadam> ?eval are you here fucker?
[02:24:34] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam: SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[02:24:37] <aaronmcadam> :D
[02:24:48] <aaronmcadam> ?translate specification to german
[02:24:50] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam, Translation (English -> German) - Spezifikation
[02:24:57] <_bart> oh noes
[02:24:57] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, that's a cognitive bias
[02:25:00] <aaronmcadam> just a random guess
[02:25:01] <_bart> I'm not german
[02:25:04] <aaronmcadam> haha
[02:25:07] <_bart> I'm dutch.
[02:25:08] <_bart> :)
[02:25:17] <aaronmcadam> ?translate specification to dutch @ _bart
[02:25:17] <DarsVaeda1> and thats not the same!
[02:25:18] <bot-t1> _bart, Translation (English -> Dutch) - specificatie
[02:25:25] <_bart> certainly
[02:25:36] <_bart> ah okay, still doesn't make so much sense
[02:25:38] <aaronmcadam> I'm not an ignorant american DarsVaeda1 :P
[02:25:42] <aaronmcadam> uh
[02:25:47] <_bart> you mean a short briefing that lists what the app should do?
[02:25:51] <DarsVaeda1> oh there are such? :D
[02:25:52] <aaronmcadam> well yeah you're doing physics
[02:25:59] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sunk_cost_fallacy#Loss_aversion_and_the_sunk_cost_fallacy
[02:26:02] <nVee> morning. I have a simple click() function which should change the src attr of a submit button. My problem is that the form partially submits before the attr changes, leaving the original image intact. What can I use to work around this? (almost give the button a default return false and only after the attr changed let it return true
[02:26:12] <aaronmcadam> not short, fully fleshed out doc on what it should do
[02:26:34] <aaronmcadam> feasibility, competing apps, etc
[02:26:40] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, no spec = agile programming. get with the times ;)
[02:26:41] <_bart> ah
[02:26:43] <_bart> nice story
[02:26:59] <aaronmcadam> if you and ur boss guy had actually done that you probably wouldn't have done the app
[02:27:16] <aaronmcadam> blackspotwiggins: you still need a roadmap or something
[02:27:17] <_bart> Still I think I'm going to finish this and make it bug-free, and then turn to the native reader
[02:27:38] <aaronmcadam> you still need a research phase
[02:27:48] <_bart> aaronmcadam: hah, exactly what this company misses
[02:27:51] <aaronmcadam> before you plan out your sprints
[02:28:03] <_bart> and everybody knows that but the boss doesn't change
[02:28:05] <DarsVaeda1> the native reader on ipad is strange
[02:28:19] <DarsVaeda1> it rotates automatically in the browser but not the app itself
[02:28:52] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, you are in a pretty shitty work environment
[02:28:58] <blackspotwiggins> that cultivates bad practices
[02:29:21] <_bart> true, but I'm 18 and they pay for these experiments, so I'm fine
[02:29:23] <nVee> morning. I have a simple click() function which should change the src attr of a submit button. My problem is that the form partially submits before the attr changes, leaving the original image intact. What can I use to work around this? (almost give the button a default return false and only after the attr changed let it return true
[02:29:23] <blackspotwiggins> you are still young and can be saved tho ;)
[02:29:48] <blackspotwiggins> nVee, so you are complaining that your page is fast?
[02:29:49] <aaronmcadam> hah
[02:29:49] <_bart> when I do freelance work I have everything set out before I write a line of code.
[02:29:56] <_bart> but that's not the way it works here
[02:29:58] <aaronmcadam> ?preventDefault @ nVee
[02:29:59] <bot-t1> nVee, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[02:30:17] <aaronmcadam> ah fair enough _bart good man
[02:30:40] <nVee> blackspotwiggins: well no, even on a long page submit, the button does not change
[02:30:57] <dr0id> aaronmcadam: are you also 18 ?
[02:31:00] <nVee> aaronmcadam: let me see quick
[02:31:03] <blackspotwiggins> nVee, well it might be because buttons dont actually have src ?
[02:31:04] <aaronmcadam> you'll do well if you keep up with the best practices, good, organised coders make for great team mates _bart
[02:31:13] <aaronmcadam> dr0id: i'm 26 dude
[02:31:35] <aaronmcadam> working on a jqm app for a large brand loyalty platform
[02:32:06] <dr0id> nice!
[02:32:08] <aaronmcadam> jqm === "jQuery Mobile"
[02:32:13] <_bart> aaronmcadam: and they won't let me use git and rails instead of php and chaos. ;)
[02:32:27] <aaronmcadam> what? no version control?
[02:32:30] <dr0id> not even git and php and chaos ?
[02:32:43] <aaronmcadam> even svn is better than nothing
[02:33:00] <dr0id> git my friend, git!
[02:33:00] <_bart> by chaos I refered to "no version control"
[02:33:06] <_bart> that's what I said
[02:33:12] <nVee> blackspotwiggins: we're using an image button so in theory it's a submit button with a src=" for a custom image
[02:33:12] <aaronmcadam> shite
[02:33:20] <aaronmcadam> what's stopping you using it anyway
[02:33:34] <blackspotwiggins> nVee, well in practice buttons dont have src.
[02:33:35] <nVee> aaronmcadam: thank you for your option, is there a way to then still return true at a later stage in the script?
[02:33:40] <aaronmcadam> it's the way you work, that guy probably doesn't know
[02:33:40] <dr0id> no one can stop you from using a VCS
[02:33:47] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[02:33:47] <blackspotwiggins> _bart, get out of there, now
[02:33:53] <blackspotwiggins> this project will fails
[02:34:02] <_bart> aaronmcadam: when you work on a project with multiple people everyone has to use it..
[02:34:02] <blackspotwiggins> no version control = doomed
[02:34:09] <aaronmcadam> nVee: loads of people ask that, it's very tricky
[02:34:19] <aaronmcadam> best to think of a different solution
[02:34:25] <Teg> @_bart: you always can use a version control just for yourself
[02:34:33] <aaronmcadam> _bart that's true
[02:34:34] <_bart> makes no sense if I'm trying to save the boat by throwing water out while others are pumping it in.
[02:34:44] <aaronmcadam> but I managed to use it for myself when I was in that situation
[02:34:57] <aaronmcadam> you can still make it work for yourself as Teg says
[02:35:01] <_bart> I use it for personal projects and freelance work, but not for the company
[02:35:06] <nVee> aaronmcadam: here is my source if it means anyhing: http://pastebin.com/gN2reGEm
[02:35:18] <aaronmcadam> nVee it's a hard problem to solve
[02:35:21] <_bart> also, I don't have a paid git account.. so..
[02:35:32] <aaronmcadam> ha it's only a few dollars
[02:35:32] <_bart> saving money
[02:35:37] <_bart> is it?
[02:35:39] <aaronmcadam> yeah!
[02:35:41] <blackspotwiggins> nVee, aaronmcadam seriously guys
[02:35:45] <aaronmcadam> you get a few private repos
[02:35:49] <blackspotwiggins> THERE IS NO SRC FOR <BUTTON>
[02:35:58] <blackspotwiggins> its not a hard problem
[02:36:00] <aaronmcadam> I don't give a fuck bout that
[02:36:12] <aaronmcadam> I'm talkin bout preventing default action and then triggering it again
[02:36:12] <nVee> <input type="image" src="images/submit.gif" id="newAttendeesSubmit" name="image" width="106" height="35" />
[02:36:18] <Teg> @_bart: I use bzr for my small projects. No administration, no account
[02:36:24] <aaronmcadam> in the past few days it's kept coming up
[02:36:58] <nVee> blackspotwiggins: it's a input button with a custom image source. Trust me, it works :P
[02:37:01] <aaronmcadam> you don't need github _bart anyway
[02:37:12] <aaronmcadam> you can mirror your git repos to any server
[02:37:13] <blackspotwiggins> nVee, why do you say you have a <button> when you have <input>. that's just rude
[02:37:18] <aaronmcadam> even dropbox _bart
[02:37:25] <nVee> blackspotwiggins: my bad :)
[02:37:32] <aaronmcadam> haha
[02:37:39] <_bart> aaronmcadam: I'm not so much of a linux/terminal man, so I like the visual magic that github does.
[02:37:40] <aaronmcadam> so you can rile blackspotwiggins up :D
[02:37:40] <dr0id> dropbox give you ssh access ?
[02:37:40] <nVee> blackspotwiggins: but now that you see what I want to do, do you have any alternative solutions perhaps?
[02:37:46] <aaronmcadam> ...
[02:37:48] <aaronmcadam> due
[02:37:50] <blackspotwiggins> preload the image
[02:37:54] <aaronmcadam> you need to learn terminal
[02:37:58] <aaronmcadam> it's easy!
[02:38:01] <blackspotwiggins> and if you look at your code
[02:38:05] <blackspotwiggins> it will always return true
[02:38:09] <aaronmcadam> and very powerful once you kno what's what
[02:38:14] <_bart> Yes I know my way around, but it still isn't very visual.
[02:38:19] <aaronmcadam> lol
[02:38:26] <aaronmcadam> CLI isn't very visual? wow
[02:38:44] <nVee> blackspotwiggins: I just want the image to be replaced while submitting
[02:38:51] <nVee> or something
[02:38:56] <aaronmcadam> oh no
[02:38:57] <blackspotwiggins> nVee, <blackspotwiggins> preload the image
[02:38:58] <_bart> I mean, I like the fact you can see what has changed and stats and stuff like that.
[02:39:00] <aaronmcadam> "or something"
[02:39:05] <_bart> visually, on a website. :)
[02:39:16] <aaronmcadam> yeah the diffs are good
[02:39:37] <aaronmcadam> don't u use git in the terminal tho? to commit?
[02:39:48] <aaronmcadam> don't tell me you depend on tortoiseGit or whatever
[02:39:50] <_bart> aaronmcadam: yes I do, but that's only like 4 commands
[02:39:56] <aaronmcadam> cool
[02:40:00] <_bart> I can remember those :)
[02:40:03] <aaronmcadam> are u on linux?
[02:40:17] <_bart> osx
[02:40:21] <aaronmcadam> kk
[02:40:34] <aaronmcadam> kaleidoscope is a great diff app on osx
[02:40:39] <aaronmcadam> you can set git to use that
[02:40:56] <dr0id> github has an app for osx, no ?
[02:41:05] <aaronmcadam> yeah I found them all to be buggy as fuck
[02:41:18] <aaronmcadam> i think there's one, gitnub or somethin, it was ok
[02:41:26] <_bart> Yes, Sofa makes pretty apps.
[02:41:29] <aaronmcadam> i'm back on linux now
[02:41:34] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[02:41:39] <_bart> but still that isn't version control.
[02:41:44] <aaronmcadam> lol course not
[02:41:50] <aaronmcadam> it's a diff tool...
[02:42:26] <_bart> isn't there an app like that to control my local version control?
[02:42:49] <dr0id> gitweb or something
[02:43:02] <aaronmcadam> app like what
[02:43:23] <dr0id> anyway, we need to focus on jQuery now.
[02:43:40] <aaronmcadam> who says :p
[02:43:53] <dr0id> me
[02:43:58] <aaronmcadam> dev practices are an important thing for people to learn
[02:44:19] <DarsVaeda1> there is a channel for that :P
[02:44:19] <_bart> aaronmcadam: an app that creates and maintains the svn or git or whatever repos?
[02:44:30] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[02:44:34] <aaronmcadam> there is tortoise
[02:44:44] <aaronmcadam> there is also another app i think on osx for git
[02:44:50] <aaronmcadam> but i'm back on linux now so i dunno
[02:45:02] <aaronmcadam> i don't need a gui app anyway
[02:45:08] <aaronmcadam> git extras does me
[02:45:11] <blackspotwiggins> DarsVaeda1, version control is just as relevant as people asking how to do render json from php
[02:45:35] <Cracker2> hi. is there a way "var divsneeded = $('#toggleTriggers_id_'+ID+' div ignoreTHISCLASSname');" meaning get all divs but ignore ones with THISCLASS ?/
[02:45:37] <DarsVaeda1> I wasn't serious on that one ;)
[02:45:49] <blackspotwiggins> ?:not @ Cracker2
[02:45:50] <bot-t1> Cracker2, :not(selector): Selects all elements that do not match the given selector. http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[02:46:00] <Cracker2> cool thanks
[02:46:38] <_bart> tortoise looks a bit crappy
[02:47:08] <aaronmcadam> _bart: https://github.com/visionmedia/git-extras
[02:47:47] <aaronmcadam> _bart you should embrace the command line dude
[02:48:20] <_bart> hmm maybe :p
[02:48:37] <_bart> git extras look okay
[02:48:42] <Cracker2> var divs = $('#toggleTriggers_id_'+ID+' div:not(.ignore)'); correct, right?
[02:48:47] <aaronmcadam> def, it's an important skill nowadays
[02:49:02] <aaronmcadam> you can't depend on every tool having a gui
[02:49:33] <aaronmcadam> and yes, some of the guis aren't the prettiest but it's the usefulness that counts
[02:49:49] <dr0id> like facebook
[02:49:51] <aaronmcadam> git summary is handy as hell
[02:50:13] <aaronmcadam> anyone on git should check that git-extras repo if they haven't already installed it
[02:50:29] <aaronmcadam> tho i use mercurial more for work
[02:50:40] <aaronmcadam> git for my own stuff
[02:50:56] <DarsVaeda1> I have svn ...regret it to this day :(
[02:50:57] <_bart> aaronmcadam: and you use git in a local git repo?
[02:51:10] <aaronmcadam> yeah course
[02:51:15] <aaronmcadam> and a github account
[02:51:33] <aaronmcadam> and a few private repos
[02:52:00] <aaronmcadam> DarsVaeda1: at least your using a vcs :)
[02:52:09] <DarsVaeda1> and better than cvs
[02:52:14] <DarsVaeda1> but not much
[02:52:16] <DarsVaeda1> :D
[02:52:21] <aaronmcadam> _bart, that's how git works lol
[02:52:29] <aaronmcadam> you need a local repo to push right
[02:53:06] <_bart> aaronmcadam: I used it with a rails project with capistrano, it was perfect.
[02:53:22] <aaronmcadam> cool I'm on django
[02:53:22] <_bart> local development in textmate and then pushing it to git and capo deploy with 1 command.
[02:53:48] <aaronmcadam> you need a local repo that's how dvcs works
[02:54:18] <aaronmcadam> if you were using a plugin or somethin it was probably commiting locally behind the scenes
[02:54:35] <Trudko> guys this I am adding innerHtml to the table this does not work $("#accountTransactionsTable_" + bodyId).html("\r\n\r\n\t<tr><td>Bla</td></tr>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n");
[02:54:50] <aaronmcadam> wtf?
[02:54:51] <Trudko> when I do html("<tr><td>Bla</td></tr>"); it does
[02:54:54] <blackspotwiggins> Trudko, why are you adding line breaks?
[02:55:05] <aaronmcadam> what's with the line chars?
[02:55:25] <aaronmcadam> dynamic html doesn't need indentation lol
[02:55:25] <Trudko> blackspotwiggins:  I am actually using ajax to load some data then I am sending xml  with those data
[02:55:38] <Trudko> blackspotwiggins:  so they are added there automaticly
[02:56:01] <blackspotwiggins> huh?
[02:56:22] <blackspotwiggins> you load the data and send xml.. and what?
[02:56:23] <cerberos> anyone know why this checkbox can't be checked? http://jsfiddle.net/bWQMD/
[02:56:38] <aaronmcadam> some people like makin life hard for themselves
[02:56:59] <Trudko> blackspotwiggins: and this xml is sent to javascript and of course i have line breaks there.
[02:57:00] <blackspotwiggins> i usually spend more time deciphering wtf is being asked than thinking for an answer
[02:57:03] <cerberos> the callbacks work, it's just not possible to check the box
[02:57:15] <aaronmcadam> lol yep blackspotwiggins
[02:57:16] <jamov> cerberos, my guess because it's not inside a form
[02:57:28] <blackspotwiggins> Trudko, xml doesnt imply line breaks fyi
[02:57:31] <aaronmcadam> shouldn't matter whether it's in a form or not
[02:57:40] <aaronmcadam> xml shouldn't include line chars
[02:57:45] <aaronmcadam> just the data
[02:57:55] <Trudko> aaronmcadam:  blackspotwiggins  I have xml file
[02:58:00] <blackspotwiggins> Trudko, not sure why it isnt working tho
[02:58:14] <aaronmcadam> with the line chars in it Trudko?
[02:58:17] <cerberos> jamov: now it is, still can't be checked http://jsfiddle.net/bWQMD/1/
[02:58:21] <aaronmcadam> do u have control over the xml?
[02:58:32] <jamov> cerberos, ok. weird.
[02:59:11] <blackspotwiggins> Trudko, http://jsfiddle.net/7UQux/
[02:59:14] <Trudko> aaronmcadam:  yes I do
[02:59:14] <blackspotwiggins> works pretty fine for me
[02:59:25] <aaronmcadam> cerberos: would help if ur fiddle was using jquery...
[02:59:37] <blackspotwiggins> also, why are you parsing xml to text?
[02:59:37] <Trudko> blackspotwiggins: i know thats the weird thing
[03:00:01] <aaronmcadam> cerberos: toggle won't work there
[03:00:13] <aaronmcadam> and you're using fiddle wrong
[03:00:19] <cerberos> aaronmcadam: I don't understand, it is using jquery. This doesn't work when I run it on my machine
[03:00:22] <aaronmcadam> take a minute to actually look at the app
[03:00:32] <aaronmcadam> it's loading Mootools on the left
[03:00:41] <aaronmcadam> hang on i'll fix it... sigh
[03:00:45] <Myx0x3> whats up with slide and margin in IE?
[03:00:48] <blackspotwiggins> Trudko, so you are doing something else wrong, html() works fine with newlines
[03:00:49] <blackspotwiggins> ?cc
[03:00:50] <bot-t1> CASE CLOASED >: |
[03:00:50] <Cracker2> is there a way to marry outerHTML and :not?
[03:01:18] <aaronmcadam> cerberos: there's also nothing triggering that toggle
[03:01:38] <cerberos> aaronmcadam: I see http://jsfiddle.net/bWQMD/3/
[03:01:51] <aaronmcadam> i'm already fixing it
[03:02:05] <cerberos> aaronmcadam: the user triggers the toggle?
[03:02:32] <aaronmcadam> with what exactly lol
[03:03:33] <cerberos> the mouse? toggle binds to the click event. So you click the checkbox and the callback is fired (which works), however I don't see a check in the box
[03:04:36] <aaronmcadam> what??
[03:04:50] <aaronmcadam> you're attaching a click event that triggers the DEFAULT action?
[03:05:10] <aaronmcadam> a click on a checkbox should check the box anyway crazy man
[03:05:51] <aaronmcadam> cerberos: http://jsfiddle.net/aaronmcadam/bWQMD/7/
[03:07:25] <_bart> oh noes, I pressed the revert button on jsbin.com
[03:07:27] <cerberos> I see, by adding handlers I'm _overriding_ the default event. I thought the callbacks were in addition
[03:07:34] <_bart> and there is no "forward" button
[03:07:53] <Cracker2> "$('#'+triggerID).next('.toggleTwo').show('slow');" will this show next IF it's .toggleTwo or it will show next .toggleTwo ?
[03:07:56] <aaronmcadam> you should see ?preventDefault @ cerberos
[03:07:57] <bot-t1> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[03:08:02] <arcanis> excuse me, I've found a bug in the latest release .data() function
[03:08:18] <arcanis> (I mean, a real bug, I've check the source code and I see why it happens)
[03:08:28] <aaronmcadam> #jquery-dev arcanis
[03:08:33] <aaronmcadam> or file a bug
[03:08:48] <blackspotwiggins> Cracker2, next if
[03:09:17] <Cracker2> is there a way next without if?
[03:09:22] <arcanis> aaronmcadam, I will do this, thanks
[03:09:38] <Cracker2> just the next .toggleTwo after $('#'+triggerID)
[03:09:47] <blackspotwiggins> Cracker2, nextAll(".something:first")
[03:10:10] <aaronmcadam> cerberos: actually dude
[03:10:16] <aaronmcadam> ahh
[03:10:20] <cerberos> aaronmcadam: hmm, I'm using .toggle() with 2 arguments
[03:10:28] <cerberos> and am not preventing the default action
[03:12:00] <Cracker2> :first pseudo class doesn't work in ie6, right?
[03:12:12] <blackspotwiggins> Cracker2, it's not a pseudoclass
[03:12:40] <aaronmcadam> cerberos: if you prevent the default action, then the box won't get checked
[03:13:09] <cerberos> I'm not preventing the default action, but the box still isn't getting checked :)
[03:13:15] <aaronmcadam> kk
[03:13:30] <aaronmcadam> and the callback u want is firing?
[03:14:06] <Cracker2> is that correct?
[03:14:23] <cerberos> Yes, this is wierd. This works but is the same as what I started with http://jsfiddle.net/bWQMD/8/
[03:15:10] <chjj> does anyone in here use showdown.js?
[03:15:15] <aaronmcadam> haha
[03:15:16] <blackspotwiggins> Cracker2, :first-child is a pseudoclass in css, which indeed doesnt work in ie6
[03:15:20] <aaronmcadam> you asked that in node didn;t u
[03:15:32] <blackspotwiggins> :first is part of jquery/sizzle so they are not related
[03:15:40] <chjj> aaronmcadam: yeah, i did
[03:15:56] <aaronmcadam> it's a markdown parser yeah
[03:16:01] <aaronmcadam> I've not used it
[03:16:07] <chjj> aaronmcadam: i want to benchmark showdown, but everyone uses it differently, im benching it against my own markdown parser
[03:16:10] <blackspotwiggins> cerberos, maybe it helps to not include both mootools and jquery
[03:16:11] <chjj> and i want to be "fair"
[03:16:15] <aaronmcadam> ahh gotcha
[03:16:19] <aaronmcadam> you tried jsperf?
[03:16:27] <aaronmcadam> lol
[03:16:37] <chjj> theres two ways to use showdown, you can either instantiate a new "converter" each time, which makes it 3 times as slow, but it works better
[03:16:48] <chjj> or you can reuse the same one, which is faster, but can create problems
[03:16:54] <guy> anyone can suggest any cool image navigation?
[03:16:55] <aaronmcadam> chjj: http://jsperf.com/ ?
[03:16:56] <chjj> so im wondering what most people do
[03:17:06] <chjj> aaronmcadam: i have no problem running the benchmarks themselves
[03:17:23] <matjas> chjj: no, http://jsperv.com/
[03:17:24] <aaronmcadam> ahhh
[03:17:27] <aaronmcadam> fair enough
[03:17:28] <chjj> aaronmcadam: im just trying to be unbiased in the way i benchmark it, because theres more than one way to do it, its written in a very weird way
[03:17:38] <cerberos> blackspotwiggins: when I run this on my machine I can't check the checkbox http://pastie.org/2432766
[03:17:57] <aaronmcadam> hang on
[03:18:03] <Double_Rainbow> hello world
[03:18:05] <aaronmcadam> does the checkbox fire a change event
[03:18:14] <Cracker2_> nvm i did it a bit different
[03:18:20] <aaronmcadam> that's what u should be binding to cerberos
[03:18:22] <cerberos> so I don't know how to use jsfiddle.net... but that's not the issue
[03:18:26] <matjas> cerberos: http://api.jquery.com/toggle
[03:18:27] <aaronmcadam> it is
[03:18:35] <Double_Rainbow> i heard a cool jquery framework is doing cross domain ajax out there?
[03:18:38] <Double_Rainbow> why?
[03:18:39] <aaronmcadam> if you can't get a demo up we can't help u
[03:18:45] <Double_Rainbow> is it not a security issue?
[03:18:56] <aaronmcadam> that's not jquery specifically
[03:19:03] <aaronmcadam> you set it in an xml file on ur server
[03:19:15] <Double_Rainbow> is there a demo?
[03:19:19] <aaronmcadam> you could blacklist domains Double_Rainbow but the vast majority seem to allow * domains
[03:19:24] <blackspotwiggins> actually, you need to set headers
[03:19:35] <aaronmcadam> Double_Rainbow: check html5 boilerplate it includes it
[03:19:47] <cerberos> I'm not using http://api.jquery.com/toggle/ , I'm using http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[03:19:59] <aaronmcadam> cerberos: have u tried change
[03:20:29] <cerberos> toggle is a proxy to change
[03:20:34] <aaronmcadam> right
[03:20:40] <blackspotwiggins> cerberos, if you need to have different behaviour based on whether the checkbox is checked, then use click and determine the state
[03:20:41] <blackspotwiggins> not toggle
[03:20:42] <aaronmcadam> ok then
[03:20:55] <blackspotwiggins> you can change the state in other ways too,
[03:21:11] <aaronmcadam> if ( $(this)[0].checked cerberos
[03:21:44] <blackspotwiggins> this.checked even
[03:21:49] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah
[03:21:55] <aaronmcadam> duh
[03:21:56] <aaronmcadam> :S
[03:21:57] <aaronmcadam> lol
[03:23:09] <aaronmcadam> check this out haha http://www.jsperf.co.uk/
[03:23:09] <cerberos> this looks like a jquery but. I'll use a different method to achieve what I want. Thanks
[03:23:21] <aaronmcadam> what?
[03:23:25] <aaronmcadam> looks like a jquery? lol
[03:23:44] <aaronmcadam> it's the jQuery JavaScript plugin, it's decent
[03:23:53] <cerberos> s/but/bug/
[03:23:56] <DarsVaeda1> I wonder if there is a more elegant way to write the addBio() function? especially the part about the formValues -> http://jsfiddle.net/HVx4u/1/
[03:24:05] <aaronmcadam> ah
[03:24:26] <aaronmcadam> the addBio function, ah yes, I really know what that is
[03:24:43] <DarsVaeda1> if you look at the fiddle you might know :)
[03:24:54] <aaronmcadam> that's not how i roll bro
[03:24:55] <aaronmcadam> :D
[03:25:06] <DarsVaeda1> then do a backRoll :)
[03:25:32] <aaronmcadam> gotta explain what ya want bettererer
[03:26:03] <aaronmcadam> anyway i gotta do some work
[03:26:05] <DarsVaeda1> I duno lika that eaching and so on
[03:26:18] <blackspotwiggins> DarsVaeda1, use serialize() for start
[03:27:01] <DarsVaeda1> yes I did but that does not give the array( name => value ) connection
[03:27:08] <blackspotwiggins> wat?
[03:27:26] <blackspotwiggins> ok, try this then
[03:27:30] <blackspotwiggins> bind to submit instead of click
[03:27:40] <blackspotwiggins> if i press enter in the text input it just skips everything
[03:28:06] <blackspotwiggins> and among other things, you are not using id var anywhere
[03:28:29] <blackspotwiggins> and serialize DOES work
[03:29:17] <aaronmcadam> ?serializeArray bra
[03:29:19] <bot-t1> aaronmcadam, jquery - How to serialize an multiple dimensional array to string and ... - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1864521/how-to-serialize-an-multiple-dimensional-array-to-string-and-the-reverse
[03:29:34] <DarsVaeda1> http://jsfiddle.net/HVx4u/2/ nope look it generates "prename=John&surname=Doe" thats a string not an array
[03:29:45] <aaronmcadam> serializeArray mannn
[03:29:58] <aaronmcadam> then u can remap
[03:29:59] <DarsVaeda1> yea I was to fast
[03:30:02] <DarsVaeda1> or you to slow :D
[03:30:08] <aaronmcadam> i told u already
[03:30:27] <blackspotwiggins> DarsVaeda1, you know that things posted ARE strings?
[03:30:49] <DarsVaeda1> yes but
[03:30:51] <blackspotwiggins> if you need them in different format, name them properly
[03:31:43] <DarsVaeda1> ahh serializeArray generates this funny array :D
[03:32:56] <aaronmcadam> DarsVaeda1: https://gist.github.com/1173161
[03:33:24] <aaronmcadam> use it like this: serialize( $( 'form' ) ); DarsVaeda1
[03:33:54] <DarsVaeda1> hmm that is basically what I am doing already...
[03:34:00] <aaronmcadam> maps the array from { name : input, value : input1val }
[03:34:14] <aaronmcadam> to { input : inputVal ... }
[03:34:29] <blackspotwiggins> how is that different from regular serialize?
[03:34:45] <aaronmcadam> it doesn't param it
[03:34:53] <aaronmcadam> as in &bla&bla&bla
[03:35:03] <aaronmcadam> I needed to turn it to json
[03:35:35] <blackspotwiggins> for this use case
[03:35:38] <aaronmcadam> yep
[03:35:39] <DarsVaeda1> yep that is need to
[03:35:49] <blackspotwiggins> you are turning it into array to turn it back to regular params
[03:36:02] <blackspotwiggins> sure, do it 3 times it will be even better
[03:36:15] <aaronmcadam> but regular serialize returns a string with params tho?
[03:36:30] <blackspotwiggins> if post an array, its regular params as well
[03:37:11] <aaronmcadam> so name: 'blah', value : 'blah' will be posted as 'blah' : 'blah' ?
[03:38:17] <aaronmcadam> if that's the case it's not obvious
[03:38:43] <blackspotwiggins> no matter how complex structure you create, if you do regular post
[03:38:58] <blackspotwiggins> it will be serialized to asdblah=1234
[03:39:03] <angerman> anyone has experienced an ajax request to be canceled upon redirect?
[03:39:20] <aaronmcadam> even with dataType: json?
[03:39:22] <blackspotwiggins> so might as well just create the proper format in the beginning and skip the manual work of converting
[03:39:23] <aaronmcadam> that can't be right
[03:39:29] <blackspotwiggins> hence regular post
[03:39:33] <blackspotwiggins> with json ofc not
[03:39:39] <blackspotwiggins> but DarsVaeda1 was not using json
[03:39:42] <aaronmcadam> ok then well that's what i want
[03:39:50] <aaronmcadam> wanted*
[03:40:02] <aaronmcadam> k I thought u were talkin to me lol
[03:40:31] <angerman> I'm doing am ajax POST, upon which the server responds with a redirect to an url with a query string; but the request never reaches the server. The Network information in Chrome shows "(canceled)"
[03:40:55] <aaronmcadam> any error code?
[03:41:03] <angerman> no, nothing.
[03:41:05] <aaronmcadam> what server side lang?
[03:41:19] <angerman> but if there's no query string append, the redirect works flawlessly.
[03:42:09] <angerman> e.g. Location: http://some.server/some/path works. But Location: http://some.server/some/path?_query=string does not.
[03:43:23] <Myx0x3> why does IE fuck up margin after slide colapse?
[03:46:09] <Laerti> Hello! i have a Jquery Menu, and it gives me Conflict in IE, i have 2 weeks now and no one solved that...
[03:46:29] <Laerti> please any help ...
[03:46:36] <DarsVaeda1> blackspotwiggins: sorry I think you are wrong...if I post the serialized inputs I get a string rather than an array...whilst if I send it as an array I also get an array back
[03:47:45] <Laerti> ?
[03:47:51] <topriddy> when one does : $(function() { 
[03:47:54] <DarsVaeda1> because it is 'set="prename=John&name=Doe" rather than 'set[prename]=John&set[name]=Doe'
[03:48:03] <topriddy> does this mean it executes on page load?
[03:48:04] <blackspotwiggins> DarsVaeda1, thats what ive been saying
[03:48:14] <blackspotwiggins> because you name your inputs
[03:48:16] <Trudko> aaronmcadam:  blackspotwiggins  I have found problem with that : IE 7 and of IE 6 does not allow \r\n\r\n\t chars inside table tag. and yes I have  to delepo for ie6
[03:48:22] <topriddy> $(function() { ...});
[03:48:30] <topriddy> does it execute this on page load?
[03:48:37] <blackspotwiggins> DarsVaeda1, if you named your inputs correctly
[03:48:41] <blackspotwiggins> it would not be a problem
[03:49:10] <blackspotwiggins> Trudko, sucks to be you then.
[03:49:17] <Laerti> any help for me please
[03:49:17] <Laerti> ?
[03:49:17] <topriddy> hello?
[03:49:29] <DarsVaeda1> define: "name your inputs correctly"
[03:49:39] <topriddy> guess nobody is interested in newbie basic questions
[03:49:45] <topriddy> :(
[03:49:46] <blackspotwiggins> DarsVaeda1, in your case set[prename] maybe?
[03:50:24] <Laerti> topriddy  im going to be mad with that
[03:50:53] <blackspotwiggins> topriddy, have a looksie in the documentation maybe?
[03:51:13] <blackspotwiggins> it means the passed function executes when the dom is ready
[03:51:41] <aaronmcadam> Trudko: remove those line characters!
[03:51:55] <aaronmcadam> Trudko: why the hell are they even there
[03:52:20] <Trudko> aaronmcadam:  how? I can write the whole xml in one line and thats horrible. Can i somewho simply remove all those chars using jquery?
[03:52:28] <aaronmcadam> topriddy: use $( document ).ready( function () { your code here } });
[03:52:32] <topriddy> blackspotwiggins:  can i have multiple of them there? and does this execute in the other they are declared.
[03:52:36] <aaronmcadam> wtf?
[03:52:40] <blackspotwiggins> topriddy, yes and yes
[03:52:59] <topriddy> aaronmcadam: okay thanks. blackspotwiggins: thank you too.
[03:53:01] <aaronmcadam> How are you saving your xml?
[03:53:16] <Trudko> aaronmcadam:  because my xml looks like this http://pastebin.com/cbyYuNZ5
[03:53:35] <blackspotwiggins> Trudko, that's a pretty shitty xml tbh
[03:53:39] <aaronmcadam> Trudko: you should be able to save
[03:53:47] <blackspotwiggins> looks more like html even
[03:53:53] <aaronmcadam> why is that not just html?
[03:54:53] <aaronmcadam> anyway you should be able to save it in utf-8
[03:55:03] <Trudko> blackspotwiggins: ? in what way how could be readable xml be shitty? Btw of course this is some dummy xml my has like 20 columns and dynamiclz generated data
[03:55:25] <blackspotwiggins> Trudko, if you generate a dynamic xml, it does not have to be readable
[03:55:29] <aaronmcadam> what encoding is it saved in
[03:55:34] <aaronmcadam> exactly
[03:55:41] <aaronmcadam> first thing i said to him blackspotwiggins
[03:55:52] <blackspotwiggins> and your paste showed a part of html. xml usually looks different
[03:55:56] <aaronmcadam> anyway, even readable xml is shitty
[03:56:14] <blackspotwiggins> and
[03:56:20] <blackspotwiggins> you use html tags in xml
[03:56:22] <blackspotwiggins> wtf is up with that
[03:56:31] <aaronmcadam> he does?
[03:56:31] <Trudko> blackspotwiggins:  I am not generating whole xml i am generating only dynamic data.
[03:57:00] <Trudko> aaronmcadam:  UTF-8
[03:57:04] <aaronmcadam> why aren't u generating xml?
[03:57:21] <aaronmcadam> are you using xslt?
[03:57:30] <aaronmcadam> aren't*
[03:58:25] <aaronmcadam> looks to me like you're probably not parsing it properly
[03:58:27] <aaronmcadam> the xml
[03:58:35] <blackspotwiggins> so you are basically using xml as html template
[03:58:37] <Trudko> because I am using VTL engine to do that
[03:58:39] <aaronmcadam> and god knows why you're using xml
[03:58:40] <blackspotwiggins> there's your problem
[03:59:01] <Trudko> anyway I will probably just find and replace /n /r hmm?
[03:59:05] <aaronmcadam> doesn't VTL support xpath to remove spaces?
[03:59:14] <aaronmcadam> normalize-space or something it's called
[03:59:30] <aaronmcadam> I've no idea what VTL is btw
[03:59:31] <Myx0x3> ive got this realy wierd thing in IE, when i toggle an div it fades out smooth, but when i toggle again it removes my first divs margin, any idea why? only in IE..
[04:00:15] <aaronmcadam> margin collapse wehay
[04:00:18] <Trudko> aaronmcadam: velocity - java template engine
[04:00:23] <aaronmcadam> uggggh
[04:00:43] <aaronmcadam> well if it's for processing xml it should have normalize space
[04:00:52] <aaronmcadam> why are you using xml?
[04:01:13] <aaronmcadam> do u have control over your stack?
[04:01:47] <Trudko> aaronmcadam:  actualy not sure why I am using....I am using it because this is ow our mproject was made of cant influence that
[04:01:57] <aaronmcadam> k
[04:02:02] <Myx0x3> aaronmcadam: any idea? lol
[04:02:13] <aaronmcadam> margin collapse sounds like
[04:02:15] <aaronmcadam> css issue
[04:02:46] <aaronmcadam> but I can only guess :P
[04:02:48] <Myx0x3> it does not fix by add overflow: hidden
[04:03:09] <Myx0x3> it did work before, but ive have no idea what i did when it stop work..
[04:03:45] <aaronmcadam> got git? :P
[04:04:04] <Myx0x3> yeah
[04:04:07] <Myx0x3> or
[04:04:19] <Myx0x3> i cant upload this :P its for my company, haha
[04:04:37] <aaronmcadam> you can make an example on fiddle tho
[04:04:42] <Myx0x3> and i cant show it.. couse its at devloper site (only visable for uss)
[04:04:58] <aaronmcadam> you can abstract your problem
[04:05:31] <blackspotwiggins> aaronmcadam, you seriously overestimate that ability
[04:05:51] <aaronmcadam> i do?
[04:06:04] <aaronmcadam> is everyone just retarded then lol
[04:06:12] <blackspotwiggins> well no
[04:06:33] <aaronmcadam> if you can't abstract your problem away from your app code then it's hard to help
[04:07:29] <aaronmcadam> also, it's when you separate it out into it's own where you might figure out the problem yourself
[04:07:48] <Myx0x3> aaronmcadam: im ifraid i dont wanna rewrite whole situation :( its kinda complicated :P
[04:07:52] <fris> should bind keypress work for mobile phones?
[04:08:10] <aaronmcadam> that's one of your issues then
[04:08:24] <aaronmcadam> yeah fris it does
[04:08:30] <aaronmcadam> keyup works
[04:09:07] <fris> k cool
[04:25:56] <Laerti> Hello! i have a Jquery Menu, and it gives me Conflict in IE, i have 2 weeks now and no one solved that...
[04:27:09] <Aamir> ?demo @Laerti
[04:27:09] <bot-t1> Laerti, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[04:27:35] <aaronmcadam> coldhead: what u workin on dude
[04:27:42] <WholemealLoaf> I know this is slightly OT, googling has failed me: Does anyone know of any UI tools/frameworks on ANY OS/Platform (.NET Silverlight/WPF/Cocoa/Gtk/Qt...) that follow a similar markup/stylesheet/unobtrusive-event-handling approach to that of JS frameworks. Basically a clean way to define UI components with markup & stylesheet?
[04:28:00] <WholemealLoaf> Amazed at some of the awful examples of XAML I'm seeing for .NET for instance
[04:28:06] <WholemealLoaf> And some of the cocoa stuff looks awful
[04:28:25] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[04:28:39] <aaronmcadam> do u mean things like sproutcore or cappucino?
[04:28:59] <blackspotwiggins> WholemealLoaf, on any platform narrows it down to nothing
[04:29:10] <WholemealLoaf> ?
[04:29:13] <WholemealLoaf> i mean ANYTHING
[04:29:19] <blackspotwiggins> ah, ok
[04:29:19] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[04:29:27] <aaronmcadam> silly blackspot
[04:29:28] <aaronmcadam> :P
[04:29:43] <WholemealLoaf> defining UI widgets with markup and stylesheet basically
[04:29:48] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[04:29:59] <blackspotwiggins> apart from web view controls, nothing comes to mind
[04:30:13] <aaronmcadam> have you looked at the frameworks like Cappucino?
[04:30:23] <aaronmcadam> or SproutCore, things like that?
[04:30:27] <WholemealLoaf> I'm trying to look for non-web related examples
[04:30:31] <aaronmcadam> ohh
[04:30:37] <aaronmcadam> aah I gotcha
[04:30:45] <WholemealLoaf> to illustrate that people use similar approaches when designed desktop UIs for example
[04:30:46] <aaronmcadam> well i know gtk3 allows you to use css
[04:30:57] <WholemealLoaf> ah interesting, I'll check that out
[04:31:04] <aaronmcadam> that's part of gnome3 tho
[04:31:16] <aaronmcadam> give it a whirl
[04:31:20] <aaronmcadam> latest fedora has it
[04:31:40] <aaronmcadam> WholemealLoaf: have a look for the image here http://virtualboxes.org/
[04:31:44] <WholemealLoaf> I'm just amazed the Cocoa and .NET stuff doesn't seem to use stylesheets?
[04:31:55] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[04:32:05] <aaronmcadam> well it's a different kind of thing isn't it
[04:32:05] <WholemealLoaf> I know .NET uses XAML, but there's all styles and shit in there, it's gross
[04:32:18] <WholemealLoaf> yeh I guess, a lot of it is generated from IDEs
[04:32:28] <aaronmcadam> valid point tho
[04:32:47] <aaronmcadam> I've never really used c# but I've tried java ui stuff, it's just as horrible
[04:32:56] <aaronmcadam> but I guess you might be able to write theme files
[04:33:00] <WholemealLoaf> yeh I used java swing once. terrible
[04:35:07] <aaronmcadam> WholemealLoaf: what sort of apps do u develop?
[04:35:58] <WholemealLoaf> jquery web apps, but I'm checkout out broader tech options for an embedded project
[04:36:04] <WholemealLoaf> checking out*
[04:36:30] <WholemealLoaf> basically want to justify to my boss that markup+stylesheet is a common pattern and the best way
[04:36:52] <aaronmcadam> problem is on the desktop side, it's not
[04:37:14] <aaronmcadam> but to be fair I don't have a whole lot of experience with desktop dev
[04:38:13] <WholemealLoaf> I dunno though, I don't see why not. I don't see why for example code like this is supposedly okay: https://github.com/alexleutgoeb/ALToastView/blob/master/ALToastView.m
[04:38:18] <WholemealLoaf> That's a Cocoa control
[04:38:30] <WholemealLoaf> Look how the styles are in the fecking code. :/
[04:38:30] <Laerti> Aamir  www.testela.al
[04:38:35] <aaronmcadam> hmm
[04:38:38] <Laerti> Aamir  www.testela.al
[04:38:47] <aaronmcadam> there's got to be a way to separate theming!
[04:38:59] <aaronmcadam> have u tried finding a cocoa channel?
[04:39:05] <aaronmcadam> or c# ?
[04:39:06] <Aamir> Laerti:  menu is working
[04:39:14] <Laerti> not in ie9
[04:39:14] <WholemealLoaf> Heh that's probably a good idea ;)
[04:39:29] <Laerti> Aamir  only in ie8
[04:39:30] <WholemealLoaf> I will go make a fool of myself with Cocoa and .NET devs :D
[04:39:39] <Aamir> Laerti: sorry don't have IE9 but do have 6,7,8
[04:39:45] <aaronmcadam> they'll probably say IKR!!!!
[04:39:46] <WholemealLoaf> Cheers for your help tho aaronmcadam
[04:39:55] <aaronmcadam> dunno how much help i was lol
[04:40:00] <aaronmcadam> interesting tho WholemealLoaf
[04:40:13] <Laerti> hmm ok
[04:40:21] <Laerti> Aamir can u install ie teste
[04:40:24] <aaronmcadam> there's gotta be a way to separate concerns on desktop surely?
[04:40:26] <Laerti> ie tester
[04:40:38] <WholemealLoaf> yeh well they do to some extent on say .NET with XAML
[04:40:43] <WholemealLoaf> but XAML contains styles too
[04:41:03] <Aamir> Laerti: I tried i.e. tester once but it does not give me the actual browser results I mean IE6 in IE tester was different from the actual IE6 so i deleted that
[04:41:05] <aaronmcadam> ah but that's layout and style together and that your issue
[04:41:19] <Laerti> Aamir  Ok thank you
[04:41:38] <WholemealLoaf> yeh that's my issues, it's a bit shitty
[04:41:41] <WholemealLoaf> issue*
[04:41:50] <aaronmcadam> anyone looking to try out different linux distros, try this site http://virtualboxes.org/
[04:50:07] <pangel> Is it possible to bind to events triggered during the capture phase?
[05:05:13] <Viliasas> Hello, does anyone know why IE9 doesn't show images in jQuery UI Dialog component? Like here http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/829/egzv.png/ Inside Dialog there is a custom table with image and description. It works well on all other browsers, except IE
[05:19:47] <Krinkle> Viliasas: Does the demo on jqueryui.com work in IE9 ?
[05:25:10] <Viliasas> i'll check
[05:26:57] <Viliasas> Krinkle: It woks. And mine also works, the problem is that it doesn't display images inside it. I've made an item description and image in dialog, but image is not displayed
[06:04:39] <topriddy> i have this question about parsing json
[06:05:45] <topriddy> what usually happens if an attribute that is boolean doesnt exist? ie what would if(jsonResp.activated){} return if activated wasnt set in jsonResp???
[06:06:50] <Jon47> topriddy, that's not really a JSON question but an object literal question
[06:08:17] <Jon47> var foo = {}; if (foo.bar) { console.log('foo.bar is.') } else { console.log('foo.bar is not.') }
[06:16:07] <xtrci> hi guys, can anyone give me a hint here?
[06:16:35] <xtrci> i have a div box which has links that opens a modal window ( using colorbox )
[06:16:39] <xtrci> it works fine
[06:16:52] <xtrci> but when i change that div box content
[06:16:55] <xtrci> with the load method
[06:17:12] <xtrci> the modal windows stop working and it just sends me to another page
[06:17:15] <xtrci> any ideas?
[06:17:42] <topriddy> Jon47: so what would happen?>
[06:17:46] <erichynds> you gotta rebind colorbox after the ajax request, xtrci
[06:18:17] <xtrci> hmmm
[06:23:28] <Jon47> topriddy, i gave you the code man
[06:23:38] <Jon47> just drop that in your console or a fiddle or something, learn something
[06:23:43] <Jon47> learn how to test it for yourself..
[06:24:00] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[06:24:10] <topriddy> Jon47: smiles. okay. should able to test somewhere on firebug.
[06:25:34] <surfdue> Anyone firmiliar with Datatables? I cant seem to find how to make the paging function show more
[06:25:53] <Jon47> topriddy awesome :)  good luck
[06:26:58] <xtrci> thx erichynds
[06:26:59] <xtrci> worked <.
[06:27:00] <xtrci> <:
[06:33:53] <xtrci> is there anyway to when calling the load method it don't gets to the top of the page?
[06:33:58] <Shwaiil> Q: I had  a small script for .submit() preventDefault, sending some data trough .post. Encapsulated on a anonymous function. Worked fine! When changing the body content of the page trough ajax, this same function doesnt work. I've tested with .delegate(), wish didnt worked. The only that worked was .live(). Is there a reason for this ? Thank you!
[06:34:21] <fris> xtrci call the load from a div then
[06:34:52] <aaronmcadam> Shwaiil: you need to be careful that the context you use for $.delegate doesn't get replaced by your ajax callback function
[06:35:05] <Shwaiil> aaronmcadam, thanks for looking.
[06:35:11] <aaronmcadam> i didn't look haha
[06:35:20] <aaronmcadam> I've just hit that problem before
[06:35:23] <Shwaiil> aaronmcadam, let's assume a product page scenario. I'm adding products to the cart.
[06:35:40] <Shwaiil> the template is the same, but the page content is changed. I get this data truogh ajax
[06:35:44] <aaronmcadam> yep done the same myself
[06:35:52] <Shwaiil> so, I think the element for .delegate get's replaced
[06:36:06] <aaronmcadam> what element are you putting ur ajax data into?
[06:36:26] <aaronmcadam> a container div around the content?
[06:36:53] <Shwaiil> The ajax data that updated the <body> content, are any kind of page requests.
[06:37:01] <aaronmcadam> ahh that's it then
[06:37:15] <aaronmcadam> replace the content on the closest wrapping div of ur content area
[06:37:43] <aaronmcadam> and then bind delegate on body
[06:38:18] <Shwaiil> aaronmcadam, I think I understand. But in this case, if I'm binding to body, I just should use .live, no ?
[06:38:22] <aaronmcadam> Shwaiil: like this $('body').delegate( '#container', 'click', function () { .... } );
[06:38:24] <Shwaiil> Isnt live like delegate on body ?
[06:38:25] <fris> whats the difference between ('body a') and just ('a')
[06:38:29] <aaronmcadam> delegate is better
[06:38:32] <aaronmcadam> no
[06:38:36] <aaronmcadam> live is just sugar
[06:38:42] <Shwaiil> aaronmcadam, ok I'll do that ;)
[06:38:46] <aaronmcadam> delegate is the better method
[06:38:47] <Shwaiil> aaronmcadam, sugar ? Like slower ?
[06:38:57] <aaronmcadam> no, syntactic sugar, and yes it is slower
[06:38:59] <Shwaiil> the thing I like on .live is we can have multiple events set
[06:39:05] <Shwaiil> I dont know the right name for this syntax
[06:39:06] <aaronmcadam> uh
[06:39:14] <aaronmcadam> delegate is the recommended method
[06:39:21] <Shwaiil> like $(el).live({ event : function() {} });
[06:39:25] <aaronmcadam> live should be deprecated but was left in because lots of scripts use it
[06:39:34] <Shwaiil> aaronmcadam, thanks ;)
[06:39:40] <aaronmcadam> Shwaiil: read the api ?delegate
[06:39:44] <Shwaiil> I'll do that, actually I've been trying to do it, change from live to delegate
[06:39:47] <aaronmcadam> bot must be down
[06:39:56] <Shwaiil> but since I had this error right now, was suspect
[06:39:59] <aaronmcadam> it's a little bit different but it's much better
[06:40:11] <Shwaiil> I'll try that right now, for the content replace and test the original delegate for the product add method
[06:40:16] <Shwaiil> thanks for looking aaronmcadam
[06:40:18] <aaronmcadam> np
[06:40:33] <Shwaiil> I believe so, many ppl wrote about it and sugested ;)
[06:40:41] <aaronmcadam> I've done a shopping cart before just like your describing
[06:40:56] <aaronmcadam> you're*
[06:43:58] <Shwaiil> aaronmcadam,yeah, its the way to do it. Looks much better, and its cooler ;)
[06:44:07] <aaronmcadam> is it workin dude?
[06:44:16] <Shwaiil> refreshing the page sucks :) I'm refreshing and testing right now
[06:44:21] <aaronmcadam> cool
[06:44:45] <aaronmcadam> i don't agree that refreshing the page sucks, but for this instance, it is better yes
[06:44:53] <Shwaiil> ehh yeah :)
[06:46:06] <Shwaiil> aaronmcadam, by the way, do you place your delegate() scripts encapsulated on anonymous fn or on dom ready ?
[06:46:53] <aaronmcadam> but it in a $( document ).ready( function () { .... } ); block
[06:47:18] <Shwaiil> I usually stick with anonymous fn, dunno way I get woste to it
[06:47:25] <aaronmcadam> why?
[06:48:00] <aaronmcadam> otherwise you can load it in a separate js file before the closing </body>  tag
[06:48:00] <Shwaiil> dont know
[06:48:10] <Shwaiil> yah
[06:48:20] <aaronmcadam> you should try to keep your code organised
[06:48:30] <Shwaiil> for js is hard :T
[06:48:35] <Shwaiil> I need to get a mvc framework
[06:48:37] <aaronmcadam> no it's not
[06:48:39] <Shwaiil> and learn it
[06:48:40] <aaronmcadam> backbone,js
[06:48:44] <Shwaiil> yeha like backbone
[06:48:46] <aaronmcadam> very easy
[06:51:37] <Shwaiil> just to be sure, I had this $('a.asyncCall').live({ click : function(){} }) and changed to $('body').delegate('a.syncCall','click',function(e){});
[06:52:18] <aaronmcadam> yes
[06:57:57] <topriddy> is it possible for me to catch the event when a user closes a window? if no, can i catch the event when a user first opens my url direct?

[07:09:34] <teolicy> Hi. I'm using jQ 1.6.2. I have an HTML5 audio element on my page which I'd like to play after a $.ajax() operation succeeds (here is the code I used: http://pastebin.com/4Br3NnW9). This works fine in recent Chrome, but fails on an iPhone. The iPhone plays the sound well if I play it from a click() event, just not from the $.ajax() success callback. Any hints?
[07:10:08] <wpsmith> I have a line of code that I need to change from static to dynamic: tb_show('', 'media-upload.php?post_id=1&amp;type=image&amp;TB_iframe=true'); I need the post_id=1 to be post_id=# based on <input type="hidden" name="menu_item_id_2041" value="2041">
[07:10:51] <teolicy> Oh, another small thing: I did try adding an alert to the success callback, and I do see the alert on the iPhone. Just the audio isn't playing.
[07:11:26] <mosez_> hi
[07:11:51] <mosez_> is somebody familar with wymeditor? how could i init wymeditor for textarea loaded with ajax?
[07:11:58] <wpsmith> here is the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/uc86G/? Any help on changing a static selection to dynamic?
[07:17:18] <djQuery> mosez_: you would need to find the textarea eash time you load it and apply the editor to it.
[07:17:30] <Jon47> wpmith, if that's a form action (ie a URL you're submitting to) then use the form.attr('action')

[07:27:35] <wpsmith> Jon47 It's not a form action. Simply (1) I need to pull a value from a dynamic hidden input field <input type="hidden" name="menu_item_id_#" value="#"> & (2) apply that number to tb_show('', 'media-upload.php?post_id=#&amp;type=image&amp;TB_iframe=true');

[07:28:30] <hariom> I am trying to submit a form using $('form#name-age').submit() but it doesn't work. form is something like:  <form id='name-age' method='post' action='get_name.html'>
[07:28:54] <Mimoso98> Hi all
[07:29:11] <jdevel> Hey, how are you.
[07:29:37] <Mimoso98> is there anyway to "cut" a bunch of html and "paste" into another location? Let's say I want to cut a DIV with certain ID and insert before another DIV with a known id. Thanks
[07:29:47] <igi> I am trying to conver mootools animation into jquery, but I dunno how to convert last part where is new Fx metioned, here is original mootols script: http://jsfiddle.net/2NZZS/ and this one is my modification with jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/2NZZS/7/ could enyone help me please?
[07:29:51] <igi> *convert
[07:29:53] <jdevel> yes
[07:29:56] <Mimoso98> I mean in the same HTML source of course.
[07:30:03] <jdevel> Mimoso, use clone
[07:30:15] <jdevel> make a deep clone of the element.
[07:30:38] <jdevel> it will bring all the decedents with it
[07:30:43] <nisseni> is there a contrary to "this" that affects all other objects but "this"
[07:30:45] <Mimoso98> oh so I make a clone at the destination and I delete the original one?
[07:30:51] <kborchers> Mimoso98: you can just to $("#divToMove").insertBefore("#otherDiv"); and it will move it
[07:31:09] <Mimoso98> kborchers, oh that one looks easier and faster indeed
[07:31:24] <jdevel> sure, you could then access the parent and remove the child node
[07:31:37] <Krambfhase> ?not @ nisseni
[07:31:38] <bot-t1> nisseni, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[07:31:43] <Mimoso98> ok thanks, let me try that
[07:32:07] <jdevel> there is also an .empty() method in jquery
[07:32:32] <jdevel> however, depending on your DOM structure you may not want to jump into the parent and clear it out...
[07:32:41] <kborchers> jdevel: no need for any of that though. the insertBefore will remove it from current location and insert in new location
[07:33:02] <Mimoso98> and what is the function to get the first child DIV for a certain DIV?
[07:33:06] <jdevel> oh no shit
[07:33:11] <kborchers> yep
[07:33:15] <Kambfhase> anyone knowing why .effect("explode") wont work with position:absolute ?
[07:33:21] <hariom> I am trying to submit a form using $('form#name-age').submit() but it doesn't work. form is something like:  <form id='name-age' method='post' action='get_name.html'>
[07:33:50] <hariom> any possible reasons ?
[07:34:02] <jdevel> Mimoso, use kborchers suggestion
[07:34:04] <Mimoso98> or perhaps I don't need that, just need to use insertAfter
[07:34:30] <Mimoso98> yes, I have <div id="a"><div id="b">...
[07:34:39] <Mimoso98> I want to insert before b and after a
[07:34:45] <Mimoso98> so I can just do insertAfter a
[07:34:46] <jdevel> as you may notice I'm still learning jquery.. but i've been writing js since the early 90's
[07:34:47] <kborchers> Mimoso98: insertAfter a
[07:34:51] <Mimoso98> ok thanks
[07:34:56] <austinbv> how do you interpret a xdomain request as json
[07:35:11] <Mimoso98> cool
[07:35:15] <Mimoso98> thanks to the two of you
[07:35:25] <Mimoso98> jQuery is amazing indeed,makes live easier
[07:35:25] <kborchers> jdevel: your method would have worked, just more work ;)
[07:35:43] <xec> Mimoso98: is b contained in a or is it terminated before?
[07:35:43] <jdevel> indeed. which is the way it used to be before jquery and some other libraries
[07:35:45] <Krambfhase> austinbv: for xdomain you have to use JSONp
[07:36:15] <jdevel> whoa
[07:36:19] <xec> yikes
[07:36:22] <Krambfhase> :|
[07:36:37] <xec> who killed the internetpeople
[07:36:43] <igi> I am trying to convert simple mootools animation into jquery, but I dunno how to convert last part where is new Fx metioned, here is original mootols script: http://jsfiddle.net/2NZZS/ and this one is my modification with jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/2NZZS/7/ could enyone help me please?
[07:37:12] <Kambfhase> igi: tried .animate() ?
[07:37:34] <jdevel> what's the problem?
[07:37:45] <igi> Kambfhase: yes, but I got error on last line when added animate
[07:38:25] <igi> it said, that it does not know start method
[07:39:03] <jdevel> why are you doing what your doing?
[07:39:08] <hariom> to submit via .submit(), is it necessary to have input with type='submit' ?
[07:39:11] <igi> me?
[07:39:25] <miyu> hi~
[07:39:26] <jdevel> whoever made the fiddle w/ the canvas
[07:39:28] <jeffsmykil> Is there dictionary support in javascript?
[07:39:44] <jdevel> drawing a green glowing circle
[07:39:44] <Kambfhase> you mean likes objects?
[07:39:46] <Jon47> hariom, .submit works on the form, not on the input
[07:39:56] <jeffsmykil> Kambfhase: I think I do mean objects
[07:40:08] <igi> Kambfhase: any ideas please?
[07:40:25] <jdevel> what do you need a dictionary for in JS?
[07:40:37] <hariom> Job47: I don't see submit working when I have .submit() and remove input type='submit'. And when I keep input type='submit' there is no point in .submit()
[07:40:45] <hariom> Some how .submit() is not working for me
[07:40:48] <jdevel> not something good for JS.. would be too damn big
[07:40:49] <Jon47> hariom have you got a fiddle we can look at?
[07:40:53] <Kambfhase> igi i think jdevelis talking to you ;)
[07:41:46] <igi> jdevel: I need a show animated progress bar on site and do not want do it using flash
[07:42:00] <jdevel> ok
[07:42:14] <jdevel> you can use a 2 div's and make one grow
[07:42:16] <jdevel> lol
[07:42:31] <jdevel> just want to have a fancy circle?
[07:42:45] <AayPizzle> Is it possible to delay a script from running until (in browsers other than Firefox) the web font is loaded?
[07:42:46] <igi> jdevel: yes I could, but I must follow design
[07:42:51] <jdevel> ahhh
[07:42:55] <igi> jdevel: cannot change approved design by client
[07:43:03] <jdevel> lovely
[07:43:36] <jdevel> actually this particular thing would be easy to do in the animation library I wrote
[07:43:59] <igi> jdevel: you think, that classic animation JQ UI cannot do this thing,
[07:44:04] <igi> ?
[07:44:21] <igi> not UI ... just JQ ...
[07:44:30] <jdevel> my aniamtion routines were based off flash like tweens
[07:45:09] <jdevel> and generally for each type of animation you just set the goto location/step/pixel..
[07:45:20] <jdevel> such as .scrollHorizontalTo(600);
[07:45:28] <igi> oh i see
[07:45:32] <jdevel> anyhow, that's not helping you
[07:45:34] <jdevel> let me loo
[07:45:36] <jdevel> look
[07:46:01] <jdevel> so you just want to convert this over to jquery?
[07:46:17] <jdevel> and have it goto a position based on the loaded "content"
[07:47:19] <jdevel> so effectively you want some behavior like prog.set(40%)
[07:47:25] <igi> jdevel: to position defined on last line of that JS
[07:47:40] <jdevel> animate to 50%
[07:47:54] <igi> jdevel: yes, exactly
[07:48:24] <igi> jdevel: I crashed on that line: var myFx =  ... I have no idea how to convert that into jQuery
[07:48:46] <hariom> Jon47:http://jsfiddle.net/UYQS5/
[07:48:59] <igi> jdevel: as I said, when I tried to convert it using animate method it was crashing on last line telling, that it does not know start metho
[07:49:06] <igi> *method
[07:50:19] <igi> hariom: here is fixed code
[07:50:23] <igi> hariom: http://jsfiddle.net/UYQS5/2/
[07:50:37] <igi> hariom: u forgot ); and the end of the script
[07:50:39] <jdevel> the circle isn't even activated until mouseover of the range control
[07:50:49] <Jon47> hariom: first of all what you really want to do is bind a custom function to the submit event of the form
[07:51:30] <igi> jdevel: this works at least with range control: http://jsfiddle.net/2NZZS/8/
[07:52:28] <jdevel> what about using an interval to set the position of the range control, then hide the control to use that to drive your animation
[07:52:34] <Mimoso98> the insertAfter works but just when I reload the page, not automatically
[07:52:35] <hydrozen> Anyone used jquery address plugin?  I'd like to clear whatever the value of the deeplinking is (so it would leave only #) but this seems to scroll back to the top
[07:52:35] <jdevel> not the cleanest solution but should work
[07:52:39] <alabd> Good day all , 2 quetios abot this chart plugin > http://www.geertdedeckere.be/shop/graphup/download/demo2/1- how to make chart 3d ? 2 - how to make it write date CRISSCROSS ؟
[07:52:43] <Mimoso98> the insertAfter works but just when I reload the page, not automatically
[07:52:46] <hariom> igi: yea, but that was not the case in the actual code. I just copied some code from it. Still after adding ); it doens't submit form
[07:52:57] <Mimoso98> do I need to do something else to achieve this effect?
[07:53:08] <hariom> Job47: why is that necessary ?
[07:53:10] <Kambfhase> Mimoso98: is your page online?
[07:53:20] <Mimoso98> unfortunately is a private intranet
[07:53:27] <hariom> I guess $('form#name-age').submit(); should be perfectly fine
[07:53:31] <jdevel> igi, did you get my last comments?
[07:53:43] <igi> jdevel: not sure what u do mean
[07:53:43] <Kambfhase> did you wrap your code in $(document).ready( ) ?
[07:53:43] <Mimoso98> do I need to use .live or something?
[07:53:58] <jdevel> notice how you can animate the circle w/ the range control
[07:54:05] <Mimoso98> yes I did
[07:54:30] <jdevel> since that works,  now you can use a setInterval to increment the value of the range control which should in turn animate the circle
[07:54:34] <Kambfhase> does you div get added to the dom late?
[07:54:49] <jdevel> wel..
[07:55:33] <jdevel> you will need to change the event from a mousemove to fire onchange of the control
[07:55:44] <Mimoso98> Kambfhase, what you mean with "late"?
[07:56:13] <jdevel> or make your own function to fire when range is changed
[07:56:19] <igi> jdevel: but that range control works for me, did you check my last link?
[07:56:23] <xec> igi: i played around with some code, cba to scroll and read log, was this yours? http://jsfiddle.net/UYQS5/8/
[07:56:26] <Kambfhase> at the time the snippet executes, is your div already in the DOM or does it get added via a ajax later?
[07:56:49] <igi> xec: nope not mine
[07:56:56] <jdevel> yes, but what I'm trying to say is.. use the range control as the engine to drive the animation of the circle drawn on the canvas
[07:57:07] <igi> jdevel: oh I see now
[07:57:13] <Mimoso98> Kambfhase, the DIV is already there
[07:57:15] <igi> jdevel: thx, I will try that
[07:57:17] <jdevel> then.. hide it so no one knows it exists
[07:57:25] <Kambfhase> hm, should work then. :/
[07:57:26] <igi> jdevel: ok
[07:57:33] <jdevel> .. it should work
[07:57:44] <igi> jdevel: thank u lot for advices
[07:57:48] <Kambfhase> ".. it should work" famous last words
[07:57:51] <Mimoso98> Kambfhase, let me check something else, I think I am not referencing correctly the DIV
[07:57:54] <jdevel> then later when jquery supports the canvas better i'm sure that you could replace that code with new code
[07:58:14] <jdevel> hey I'm just talking theory here, so I can't say it will work :)
[07:58:19] <xec> hariom: did you get it sorted? this was yours? http://jsfiddle.net/UYQS5/8/
[07:58:23] <jdevel> but I believe it will.
[07:58:43] <vivep> I am new to jquery . I want to send a http request to a place. How am i supposed to do that using jquery ?
[07:58:56] <vivep> *to a place in the sense to a website URL
[07:58:58] <hariom> igi, Jon47: I guess if the name of the input  is 'submit' .submit() doesn't seem to work.
[07:59:01] <jdevel> first ask yourself why do I need jquery to do that?
[07:59:02] <hariom> xec: not really
[07:59:12] <Jon47> interesting hariom
[07:59:13] <Jon47> nice catch
[07:59:15] <Mimoso98> found some errors trying now
[08:00:00] <jdevel> sounds like you could use a submit button vivep.. why jquery to submit a form?
[08:00:06] <hariom> Isn't that a bug in jquery?
[08:00:11] <xec> hariom: any reason the button is of type "button" instead of "submit"?
[08:00:27] <hariom> xec: because I am using .submit()
[08:00:31] <Kambfhase> ?ajax @ vivep
[08:00:32] <bot-t1> vivep, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[08:00:38] <hariom> or I will need to use preventDefault()
[08:00:55] <jdevel> brb
[08:01:00] <jdevel> coffee and a smoke
[08:01:18] <hariom> I see that jquery might have bug in .submit(). If the input inside form element has name='submit' .submit() won't work
[08:03:41] <vivep> jdevel : Sorry not to submit a form . I have written this for trial in my php now <?php echo "lat=12.938482&lon=77.534637"; ?>. I want to get that data to my javascript using Jquery
[08:04:34] <vivep> bot-t1 : Thanks . I'll give it a try and get back
[08:06:34] <Mimoso98> HHOOOOOOO
[08:06:39] <Mimoso98> I think I know where the problem is
[08:06:43] <michael_> anyone familiar with jquery file upload? I'm trying to upload a file and submit a bit of json or general some data within the same post request. is that possible? couldn't find any docs or any information about it. thanks for any help or suggestion
[08:06:48] <Mimoso98> The destination DIV might be HIDDEN
[08:07:12] <Mimoso98> I am using DIV that can be set visible or hidden when clicking on a + or - buttons. Could be this the problem?
[08:07:19] <michael_> What I thought was using json and read the file in the browser and send the content via json, but that sound so wrong or?
[08:07:30] <xec> hariom: http://jsfiddle.net/UYQS5/12/
[08:08:08] <xec> hariom: .submit() works fine even with a button named submit, what is your version of code now?
[08:12:48] <vivep> jdevel , bot-t1 : Is this the right way to send a request to my php file to get the info prop http://pastebin.com/cP0jPxtM ?
[08:13:15] <Zweisteine> Hey all, is it possible to bind to a change event and receive the call even when it's changed programatically?
[08:13:31] <Kambfhase> vivep: way to go!
[08:14:15] <vivep> Kambfhase : thanks will try it right awsy
[08:14:19] <vivep> *away
[08:14:25] <Mimoso98> still need to reload the page to make insertAfter to work,
[08:14:40] <Mimoso98> do I need to use .live or something like that?
[08:15:10] <xec> Mimoso98: in what context are you calling insertAfter?
[08:16:06] <Mimoso98> xec, I have a <div id='a'><fieldset><table id='ta'>..</table><table id='tb'>..</table><table id='tc'>..</table>
[08:16:25] <Mimoso98> </div><dv id='b'>.. etc..
[08:16:34] <xec> could you make a live demo, on jsfiddle or something?
[08:16:38] <Mimoso98> dec, so I want to move table ta for example to div b
[08:17:03] <Mimoso98> I'm sorry it's a private intranet
[08:17:29] <Mimoso98> the thing is that I am doing $('#ta').insertAfter('#a field set');
[08:17:31] <xec> surely you can copy needed html / js?
[08:17:38] <Mimoso98> which works, but I need to reload the page
[08:17:58] <Mimoso98> I'll try where can I do that?
[08:18:59] <hariom> xec: I see that the fiddle you sent just invokes the alert but doens't submit the form. Try after commenting alert and e.preventDefault(). Do you see form going to google.com ?
[08:19:03] <xec> Mimoso98: jsfiddle.net
[08:20:49] <hariom> xec: there is not use of this: $('#name-age').submit(function(e) ... .);
[08:21:11] <hariom> xec: $('#name-age').submit(); should work alone.
[08:21:22] <hariom> but it doesn't.
[08:22:13] <xec> hariom: aha, i see what you mean now
[08:22:49] <enDigg> Hello, I'm serializing form with serialize() and i post it with .ajax()  in return I get new form . I replace old form with new one. The problem is once I try to serialize that new form I get no data at all. Here is code sample :http://jsfiddle.net/VVHcF/1/
[08:22:53] <hariom> xec: try, renaming the button's name to name='submit1' and see it will try to go to google.com; it will submit the form
[08:23:04] <Mimoso98> xec, no way, this is a Module for Drupal, there are hundreds of dependencies to make the page to work
[08:23:14] <hariom> xec:but if name='submit' it won't submit the form
[08:23:22] <hariom> this seems a bug in jquery
[08:23:31] <enDigg> anyone could help me with that please ?
[08:23:53] <xec> hariom: you're right, that is weird
[08:24:17] <hariom> xec: yea
[08:24:38] <Mimoso98> I have multiples DIVs which each one can have multiple TABLEs. All of them are created initially. Then I want to move one Table from one DIV into another one. It is working great but I need to reload the page. I coudlunderstand this if the tables or divs were not ready at that time, but they are.
[08:25:17] <ajpiano> hariom: don't name your form elements the name of other form elements and attributes
[08:25:21] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/3685
[08:25:59] <xec> Mimoso98: i started one for you, is this structure correct? http://jsfiddle.net/tL6KJ/
[08:26:03] <jdevel> Mimoso, are you doing server side scripting with this also?
[08:27:06] <jeffsmykil> Is this allowed?  if (jQuery.inArray(newArray[i], newMinArray) != 1)
[08:27:45] <Kambfhase> what are you trying to do?
[08:28:00] <jeffsmykil> its in a loop
[08:28:03] <hariom> ajpiano: It says that bug is fixed. Is it? I am using 1.6.2 but I see this bug
[08:28:13] <jeffsmykil> trying to find out if part of an array is in another array
[08:28:14] <Mimoso98> xec, yes I update it with more
[08:28:30] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: That will tell you if newArray[i] is in newMinArray
[08:28:39] <xec> Mimoso98: cool, just hit update when youre done and give us the new url :)
[08:28:39] <Mimoso98> dec, so I want to move let's say #a #tb to #c
[08:28:54] <Mimoso98> http://jsfiddle.net/tL6KJ/1/
[08:29:04] <goodknight> I am trying to figure out how to get a variable to equal the result of a function that has a $.getJSON inside of it. Obviously the variable is set before the JSON is returned, but I am wondering if there is a way to go about this. http://pastie.org/2434015
[08:29:07] <ajpiano> hariom, why don't you just not give your form elements bad names
[08:29:12] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: yeah. thats what I thought
[08:29:20] <jeffsmykil> must be an error somewhere else
[08:29:38] <xec> Mimoso98: you can only have any given id once - you have three id="tb" now
[08:29:46] <jeffsmykil> oh i found it
[08:29:50] * jeffsmykil face palm
[08:29:51] <hariom> ajpiano: name='submit' is not at all a bad name. I don't think javascript has a standard defined for not using 'submit' as a name
[08:30:01] <ajpiano> yes it is a bad name
[08:30:07] <hariom> I guess it is a bug
[08:30:17] <ajpiano> hariom: form elements get expando'd directly on to form.foo
[08:30:23] <ajpiano> so then not only is there form.submit() as a method
[08:30:31] <Mimoso98> http://jsfiddle.net/tL6KJ/2/
[08:30:32] <ajpiano> there's form.submit, which is a direct reference to the named element "submit" on the form
[08:30:36] <Mimoso98> that doesn't work
[08:30:36] <ajpiano> so it's... bad.
[08:31:03] <hariom> Is it a javascript standard or jquery restriction?
[08:31:10] <ajpiano> it's how javascript works
[08:31:15] <ajpiano> there are more tickets give me a sec
[08:32:00] <hariom> ajpiano: is it really a javascript ecma standard?
[08:32:01] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/7712
[08:32:02] <jdevel> an ID in general programming is unique
[08:32:22] <ajpiano> hariom: that's how the DOM spec works :/
[08:32:26] <ajpiano> so it's best to just work around it
[08:32:38] <ajpiano> and not give your form elements the names of things that are also form methods and attributes
[08:32:42] <Sengoku> Hey
[08:33:21] <thinkt4nk> it's different in languages like PHP that distinguish between named functions and named properties, but this is because functions are second-class citizens in a language like PHP
[08:33:42] <jdevel> echo ajpiano msg[msg.length-1]
[08:33:56] <Mimoso98> xec any luck?
[08:33:59] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: can you use inArray to tell you the number of times it is in the array?
[08:34:07] <xec> Mimoso98: looking
[08:34:16] <Sengoku> Does anyone here know of a plugin that gives the following functionality: Table, with a pop-up form that adds to the table (while generating hidden input fields). Also whenever adding it does a get which validates the pop-up form. If successful, then it adds it to the table, and adds a hidden input field
[08:34:29] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: No
[08:35:01] <vivep> jdevel , bot-t1 : I told what you guys told . http://pastebin.com/2S5H6vsQ . This is my full code. But its not working. Can you guys please find out where i am going wrong and correct me? I'll be very glad
[08:35:05] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: but i could get the indexes
[08:35:08] <vivep> *i tried
[08:35:10] <jeffsmykil> and count those?
[08:35:15] <Sengoku> anyone?
[08:35:16] <Eviltwin> The first index, I believe
[08:35:18] <xec> Mimoso98: http://jsfiddle.net/tL6KJ/4/
[08:35:35] <Eviltwin> Sengoku: Sounds like a hell of a lot for just one plugin
[08:35:41] <Sengoku> lol
[08:35:48] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Are you trying to remove duplicates from an array?
[08:35:48] <Sengoku> i guess not then?
[08:35:56] <Eviltwin> Sengoku: Most likely not
[08:36:05] <xec> Mimoso98: note that i chose "onDomReady" so it needs to be wrapped in document ready event
[08:36:20] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: nope trying to count occurences in an array
[08:37:05] <BlibbleKing746> Hey, what would the best way to make sure a mouseover event is only fired once?
[08:37:13] <Eviltwin> var counts = {}; $.each(myArray, function(i,v){ if(v in counts) counts[v]++ else counts[v] = 1 })
[08:37:24] <Mimoso98> xec, but my code is already wrapped by 	$(document).ready(function() {..
[08:37:29] <BlibbleKing746> I am building a custom accordian slider, but the animations que up.
[08:37:37] <Kambfhase> ?one
[08:37:38] <bot-t1> .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[08:37:43] <Eviltwin> bot-t1: Use .stop?
[08:37:43] <bot-t1> Eviltwin, Signs point to yes.
[08:37:47] <xec> Mimoso98: then you should do as i did, and not use any given id more than once
[08:37:47] <Eviltwin> Err
[08:37:52] <Eviltwin> BlibbleKing746: Use .stop?
[08:37:56] <jdevel> vivep: you can't used the reserved try as your own function
[08:37:58] <xec> Mimoso98: if it is a recurring table, use class instead
[08:38:09] <BlibbleKing746> ha, that was easy
[08:38:13] <BlibbleKing746> cheeers
[08:38:14] <jdevel> your test function is not properly named
[08:38:18] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: What is V?
[08:38:33] <Eviltwin> The value in the array
[08:38:35] <Mimoso98> xec, is there a reason for that?
[08:38:41] <vivep> jdevel : oh okay thanks i didn't know that. i'll change the name of the function. Are there any other errors noticible in the code?
[08:38:48] <Eviltwin> If the array is ["foo"] the code inside that function(i,v) will run once with i as 0 and v as "foo"
[08:38:53] <vivep> jdevel : btw thanks
[08:38:54] <Eviltwin> i = index, v = value
[08:39:08] <xec> Mimoso98: yes, the html standard says so ;) id's should be unique on page
[08:39:40] <jeffsmykil> is var counts an object Eviltwin?
[08:39:51] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Yes
[08:40:00] <AlexC_> g'morning
[08:40:04] <Eviltwin> You can check if "foo" appears in the array via if("foo" in counts)
[08:40:04] <Mimoso98> xec, yeah ok in that example, but in mine they are different
[08:40:15] <Eviltwin> And you can check the number of times it appears with counts["foo"]
[08:40:21] <Eviltwin> After the codes runs
[08:40:25] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: sorry, trying to read through it, Im not great with each prefer for loops
[08:40:29] <xec> Mimoso98: what is different
[08:40:31] <jdevel> I'm not sure about what is default in jquery in the return type for the ajax call.. I'm assuming it is text from the way your handling it., change the try() to something else and give it a go.
[08:40:48] <goodknight> Anyone have an idea of how to get a function to set a variable after $.getJSON returns?
[08:40:49] <jdevel> vivep ^
[08:41:02] <enjoycrf> dood why do ppl use try
[08:41:13] <enjoycrf> its the most worthless command ever
[08:41:14] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: var counds = {}; for(var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) { var v = myArray[i]; if(v in counts) counts[v]++; else counts[v] = 1 }
[08:41:24] <Eviltwin> Okay, typo at the beginning there
[08:41:31] <Eviltwin> s/counds/counts/
[08:41:32] <Mimoso98> the IDs
[08:41:35] <jdevel> enjoycrf, he was using it as his own "test" function namespace
[08:41:44] <jdevel> but it is a reserved namespace
[08:41:45] <jeffsmykil> kk ill look again
[08:41:53] <enjoycrf> ok
[08:42:11] <enjoycrf> try is worthless right
[08:42:16] <enjoycrf> ?
[08:42:20] <jdevel> eh, I wouldn't go that far
[08:42:27] <xec> Mimoso98: maybe this illustrates better? http://jsfiddle.net/tL6KJ/5/
[08:42:32] <jdevel> can save your code from completely crashing
[08:42:40] <enjoycrf> right
[08:42:49] <jdevel> js fails.. it fails..
[08:42:55] <enjoycrf> whats the mechanics behind try
[08:43:00] <vivep> jdevel : I changed the name to test. I still didn't get the result. Actually the url part i was trying using a sample code. I don't know how to do it . Would be very glad if you can give me the proper way to take the echo part in my php
[08:43:25] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: am i replacing in with inArray? or is in a real thing?
[08:43:39] <Mimoso98> wec, that's what I'm doing in my code basically, and ready() is wrapping things here..
[08:43:43] <vivep> my php has only this much. I want to get it using JQuery
[08:43:58] <jdevel> vivep, first try to just output a few words like hello world!
[08:44:12] <jdevel> then move up from there once you've established that it works.
[08:44:19] <xec> Mimoso98: did you switch from using id's to classes?
[08:44:24] <AlexC_> The following code is making Chrome become unresponsive for quite a while: https://gist.github.com/1173701 it is trying to handle about 2000 li elements (I know ...), how can I optimize it? It works fine in Firefox, Opera and MSIE
[08:44:44] <Mimoso98> xec, I might have found the problem. I'm calling to insertInto or to appendTo into the var function called by $.get(url, null,save_individual_bnp);
[08:44:47] <vivep> jdevel : you're talking in my php right ? I just have a string not much in my php
[08:44:48] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: That code (either version) takes an array and constructs an object that you can use to check the number of occurrences of something in the array
[08:45:01] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: I believe that's what your whole issue was
[08:45:02] <vivep> jdevel : just one line php thats all
[08:45:06] <Mimoso98> I call the get method, and under the save_individual_bnp function I call to the insertAfter
[08:45:16] <vivep> jdevel : echo someString
[08:45:21] <sadmicrowave> I'm looking for a more efficient way to write this function: http://jsfiddle.net/tnGeF/ any ideas?
[08:45:24] <Mimoso98> wec, is it possible that during that time the DOM is not ready?
[08:45:24] <jdevel> yea, let me see that line
[08:45:28] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: ty for your help sir
[08:45:35] <Eviltwin> No problem, any time
[08:45:42] <enjoycrf> i would stop writing html w js first off
[08:45:45] <jdevel> like this?  <?php echo 'hello world'; ?>
[08:46:06] <sadmicrowave> enjoycrf, was that to me?
[08:46:08] <xec> Mimoso98: when are you calling get? are the tables drawn on page via ajax?
[08:46:11] <enjoycrf> i would use print not echo
[08:46:19] <enjoycrf> to everyone
[08:46:21] <sadmicrowave> lol
[08:46:29] <jdevel> i've never had an issue w/ echo and it's shorter..
[08:46:35] <enjoycrf> hehe
[08:46:58] <enjoycrf> i write nothing w js
[08:46:58] <Mimoso98> xec, the tables are drawn statically before calling get. Each table as a "Save"icon that when pressed calles the .get function to do AJAX for saving inputs fields show into the table
[08:46:59] <jdevel> less keystrokes add up in big systems]
[08:47:06] <enjoycrf> everything is printed w php
[08:47:15] <enjoycrf> and only manipulated w js
[08:47:30] <Mimoso98> dec, when you save one table, it should be moved to another DIV (another category)
[08:47:34] <enjoycrf> if things get a bit slow u can always further chop up ur php
[08:47:45] <enjoycrf> but its never been a problem
[08:47:50] <Mimoso98> wec, so that's what I call the inertInto to move the table
[08:48:13] <enjoycrf> and set up a single function that handles all ur php functions
[08:48:27] <enjoycrf> like ajax_handler()
[08:48:40] <Mimoso98> xec, see here and start from the bottom to up http://jsfiddle.net/tL6KJ/5/
[08:48:56] <enjoycrf> print $_POST['function_name']();
[08:48:59] <Mimoso98> xec, entry point : $('a.bnp-save-individual').click(function()
[08:49:30] <xec> Mimoso98: paste the code you have into jsfiddle?
[08:49:45] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: if you are ever in NH ill buy you a beer
[08:49:52] <Mimoso98> xec, yes I did see http://jsfiddle.net/tL6KJ/5/
[08:49:56] <Mimoso98> xec, entry point : $('a.bnp-save-individual').click(function()
[08:50:17] <xec> did you click update? :P
[08:50:21] <Mimoso98> xec, if($(document).ready()){ was a last add to just try Document is ready
[08:50:37] <Mimoso98> xec, it's a new one: http://jsfiddle.net/tL6KJ/5/
[08:50:51] <xec> i dont see anything new there
[08:51:39] <xec> besides, i made the number 5, and gave it to you
[08:51:41] <Mimoso98> http://jsfiddle.net/AXA4U/1/
[08:51:48] <Mimoso98> sorry still learning this tool
[08:51:52] <xec> allright
[08:52:03] <Mimoso98> notice all the alerts I have are for debugging
[08:52:21] <Mimoso98> xec, everything works fine, but I need to reload the page
[08:53:29] <xec> Mimoso98:             if($(document).ready()){ ??
[08:53:50] <xec> Mimoso98: read up on http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[08:54:14] <dvgsvc> how can i use jquery.post to send an image?
[08:54:20] <Mimoso98> xec, the code I gave you is just a part of the file, which is enclosed to that function
[08:54:57] <Mimoso98> xec, here you have the complete file now that you know where the important part is: http://jsfiddle.net/AXA4U/2/
[08:55:23] <Mimoso98> so /1 is the part of the file where I'm doing this, /2 is the complete file
[08:56:11] <xec> yeah okay
[08:56:27] <xec> still, i dont think that line makes much sense
[08:57:00] <Mimoso98> dec, yeah that was the last thing I tried before pasting the cod :)
[08:57:32] <Mimoso98> http://jsfiddle.net/AXA4U/3/
[08:57:34] <Mimoso98> there you go
[08:58:56] <edoloughlin> #join javascript
[08:59:08] <Mimoso98> is there any way to wait until .get has finished and Dom is ready?
[08:59:52] <thinkt4nk> Mimoso98 > you can use .ajax, but it's the wrong way in almost every case, since the UI blocks while waiting for response
[09:00:09] <xec> Mimoso98: is you only $.get() call at the very bottom there?
[09:00:18] <xec> thinkt4nk: sense. you make little.
[09:00:53] <xec> Mimoso98: is save_individual_bnp a function defined somewhere?
[09:01:32] <Mimoso98> xec, there is only one call to .get, and the function save_individual_bnp function is defined on the top
[09:02:37] <goodknight> I am trying to figure out how to get a variable to equal the result of a function that has a $.getJSON inside of it. Obviously the variable is set before the JSON is returned, but I am wondering if there is a way to go about this. http://pastie.org/2434015
[09:02:52] <xec> Mimoso98: ok, that should execute after .get has finished (and seeing as the get is in document ready... dom will also be ready)
[09:03:16] <xec> Mimoso98: what does it do?

[09:03:19] <enjoycrf> Danica leaving IndyCar for NASCAR
[09:03:21] <thinkt4nk> xec> if I make little sense, then you're an idiot http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1052453/ajax-requests-synchronous-vs-asynchronous
[09:03:23] <enjoycrf> nooooooooooooo
[09:03:31] <enjoycrf> lol
[09:03:47] <thinkt4nk> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[09:04:17] <Mimoso98> xec, found the issue
[09:04:39] <enjoycrf> thats the spirit lol
[09:04:44] <Mimoso98> the switch is now working somehow, the variable "dest" is 0, is note being assigned the "name" of the DIV where to send the TABLE
[09:04:57] <Kambfhase> thinkt4nk: you have to use a callback there
[09:05:12] <Kambfhase> oh, fuck, sorry
[09:05:17] <xec> thinkt4nk: thanks for calling me an idiot, thats always a nice way to start a conversation, i feel :) - $.ajax() is asynchronous by default, the better approach would be to use the callback, no?
[09:05:28] <Mimoso98> xec, I've noticed that for example when status=0 dest is 0 too, but should be "hot"
[09:05:34] <Kambfhase> goodknight: you have to use a callback there
[09:05:42] <Mimoso98> so the table can be sent into '#hot fieldset'
[09:06:01] <Mimoso98> however is being sent to '#0 fieldset' which doesn't exist
[09:06:03] <enjoycrf> omfg how much easier can it get
[09:06:16] <enjoycrf> why dont u try a coal mine
[09:06:35] <thinkt4nk> xec > yes, that was exactly my point, but he asked a question, and I answered in a comprehensive manner
[09:06:46] <thinkt4nk> is it possible? yes.  is it desirable? no.
[09:07:25] <thinkt4nk> xec > I also feel that a better way to start a conversation is to attack someone with a petty, belittling comment with no understanding of the context
[09:07:34] <ajpiano> um fyi guys
[09:07:45] <ajpiano> if you want to do ajax before dom ready and then do stuff to the dom on dom ready
[09:07:46] <ajpiano> you can do
[09:07:57] <Mimoso98> So the problem I have is here:
[09:07:58] <Mimoso98> 	var dest;
[09:07:58] <Mimoso98> 			switch(status){
[09:07:58] <Mimoso98> 				case 0:dest='hot';
[09:07:58] <Mimoso98> 				break;
[09:07:58] <Mimoso98> 				case 1:dest='cold';
[09:08:00] <Mimoso98> 				break;
[09:08:02] <Mimoso98> 				case 2:dest='warm';
[09:08:04] <Mimoso98> 				break;
[09:08:06] <Mimoso98> 				case 3:dest='unq';
[09:08:08] <Mimoso98> 				break;
[09:08:09] <xec> lol
[09:08:10] <Mimoso98> 				case 4:dest='unp';
[09:08:12] <Mimoso98> 				break;
[09:08:13] <thinkt4nk> wow, flood
[09:08:14] <Mimoso98> 				case 5:dest='na';
[09:08:15] <ajpiano> Mimoso98: PLEASE stop pasting code blocks in the channel
[09:08:15] <Kambfhase> thou shall not paste into the chat.
[09:08:16] <Mimoso98> 				break;
[09:08:17] <dvgsvc> how can i use jquery.post to send an image?
[09:08:18] <Mimoso98> 			}
[09:08:19] <thinkt4nk> wow

[09:09:24] <enjoycrf> some1 plz strangle mismo
[09:09:30] <thatryan> using window.jQuery || document.write('<script src=" etc.. can I check what version of jQuery is currently installed and replace if old?
[09:09:32] <Mimoso98> what?
[09:09:33] <tbranyen> ajpiano: uhhhhhh deferrrreeeeeeds
[09:09:38] <Mimoso98> what's wrong with a swtich?
[09:09:41] <tbranyen> fah me now

[09:09:48] <enjoycrf> he sux so bad
[09:09:52] <xec> ajpiano: sure, but his $.get() is already inside a document ready ;)
[09:09:55] <enjoycrf> kill him ajpiano
[09:09:58] <ajpiano> xec: olol
[09:10:02] <ajpiano> enjoycrf: relax man
[09:10:13] <tbranyen> don't do it, if you wanna get through it
[09:10:17] <ajpiano> the only thing worse than an accidental paste is someone talking about the accidental paste for a really long time
[09:10:22] <Kambfhase> Mimoso98: dest = ['hot','cold','warm','unq'][source]
[09:10:30] <enjoycrf> thank u
[09:10:32] <enjoycrf> jesus
[09:10:40] <jeffsmykil> what about when the accidental paste is your password ajpiano?
[09:10:43] <Mimoso98> Kambfhase, what is that?? first time I see that syntax
[09:10:52] <Kambfhase> its called Array.
[09:10:55] <thatryan> lol
[09:11:05] <enjoycrf> i want to rip his face off
[09:11:23] <Mimoso98> enjoycrf, so you were born being a master in coding right?
[09:11:50] <enjoycrf> im that lil kid in the matrix with the spoon
[09:11:53] <DarsVaeda1> seems more he is a master in gaining bans in irc-channels ;)
[09:12:00] <thatryan> Again.... I am using  window.jQuery || document.write('<script src=" etc.. can I check what version of jQuery is currently installed and replace if old?
[09:12:09] <Mimoso98> Kambfhase, I'm sorry, know $myarray=array(.. in PHP or int a[14]; in C for example, that one is new for me
[09:12:09] <cylence> To confirm, if I have a page at www.domain.com, that page cannot access a cookie at sub.domain.com, right?
[09:12:17] <ajpiano> thatryan: jQuery.fn.jquery
[09:12:26] <ajpiano> is the version string
[09:12:50] <jdevel> i'm curious, does anything see anything wrong with this.. if((function(){var rVal = true;return rVal;})()){}else{}
[09:12:56] <jdevel> anyone*
[09:13:14] <enjoycrf> i see weird
[09:13:31] <Kambfhase> Mimoso98: ['foo','bar',6,7,8] is somewhat equal to {01,2,3} in C or Java, only that Array in JS can have different types of elements
[09:13:36] <xec> i have a headache
[09:13:37] <energee> can i make/use a script to trim a body's text to fit to parent div?
[09:13:57] <Mimoso98> Kambfhase, ok thanks
[09:14:13] <Kambfhase> energee: you could overflow:hidden the parent div :o
[09:14:19] <Mimoso98> dec, are you still there?
[09:14:35] <xec> jdevel: it looks allright to me
[09:14:51] <DC1> could I get some help with an php array issue? just need another set of eyes. I have been staring at it for to ling
[09:14:52] <jdevel> just sometimes want to do a little more to validate some things..
[09:14:57] <Mimoso98> xec, are you still there?
[09:15:01] <energee> kambfhase: but will this only work if i set a specific height to the text?
[09:15:10] <xec> Mimoso98: yes?
[09:15:45] <energee> (This is for dynamic divs where i want the text to take up the whole div when there is not a photo)
[09:15:48] <Kambfhase> you would need to have dimension set on the parent div, yes
[09:15:53] <enjoycrf> energee what r u tryiing to do
[09:15:59] <enjoycrf> i think im doing the same thing now
[09:15:59] <Mimoso98> xec, just wondering if you were still looking at my ugly code ? he he
[09:16:01] <DC1> http://pastebin.com/sWZyfjBA
[09:16:14] <energee> enjoycrf: fairobserver.com
[09:16:15] <enjoycrf> that is the ugliest code
[09:16:55] <enjoycrf> and
[09:16:58] <energee> enjoycrf want to be able to fill the white space with text based on how much room is in the divs of that uL
[09:17:24] <enjoycrf> yeah just do overflow hidden or trim
[09:17:31] <enjoycrf> i mean length
[09:17:31] <DarsVaeda1> DC1: -> #php
[09:17:48] <xec> Mimoso98: nope, i thought you got help, with the array syntax and callbacks and whatnot? :D
[09:18:17] <xec> Mimoso98: you said you found the issue, your switch didnt work? did you get that sorted?
[09:18:42] <enjoycrf> i cursed his switch lol
[09:18:47] <enjoycrf> so it failed
[09:18:52] <Mimoso98> xec, yes, it's now just a matter of finding the right DIV level where to insert the table, thank you very much for your help
[09:19:27] <xec> enjoycrf: i love how helpful you are :)
[09:19:31] <xec> Mimoso98: yw
[09:19:45] <frankperez87> I have a question not sure if its possible. I'm prepending a row into a table which also contains a select box that when you choose something from the select it issues an ajax call. The issue im having is that since the select box is being added to the DOM after the page loads looks like the .change method is not recognizing the select box
[09:19:56] <frankperez87> it works on any other selects that were loaded on page load
[09:20:16] <frankperez87> any way to make the .change realize the new select boxes are in place
[09:20:35] <Eviltwin> frankperez87: Can we see your code via jsfiddle or pastebin?
[09:20:37] <enjoycrf> .change is at the wrong level
[09:20:55] <frankperez87> let me check how pastebin works
[09:21:01] <Kambfhase> frankperez87: http://docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[09:21:02] <Eviltwin> It's pretty damn simple
[09:21:02] <enjoycrf> in needs to be in callback
[09:21:06] <xec> frankperez87: you probably want delegates or live
[09:21:11] <enjoycrf> or that
[09:21:19] <frankperez87> xec: ill check what delgates is
[09:21:19] <enjoycrf> but ive never used live yet haha
[09:21:28] <frankperez87> .live doesnt seem to work in IE
[09:21:31] <frankperez87> for chagne
[09:21:35] <frankperez87> change*
[09:21:37] <enjoycrf> live seems weird
[09:21:46] <xec> live is the older one i think
[09:21:53] <Eviltwin> The older one?
[09:22:09] <enjoycrf> id rather chain my events properly
[09:22:11] <Kambfhase> it should work in IE if you use 1.4 or older
[09:22:13] <xec> as in delegates might have been meant to replace it
[09:22:44] <Eviltwin> They still serve different purposes
[09:22:48] <Eviltwin> delegate is more abstract
[09:23:02] <frankperez87> would i just be able to use .change within the delegates method
[09:23:43] <Eviltwin> frankperez87: Not sure you're understanding what delegates does
[09:23:48] <xec> Eviltwin: i thought they were pretty much the same, whats the difference
[09:24:55] <frankperez87> Eviltwin: im reading up on it now
[09:24:58] <frankperez87> let me see how i can use it
[09:25:04] <xec> frankperez87: instead of .change(...) you could do .bind('change',...) - .change is just an alias.
[09:25:15] <enjoycrf> dont do that
[09:25:18] <enjoycrf> that looks ugly
[09:25:22] <xec> frankperez87: so rather than using .bind() you can use .live()
[09:25:55] <enjoycrf> those are all run around solutions
[09:26:09] <enjoycrf> just place ur code corectly
[09:26:21] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: how do i read out the property name?
[09:26:23] <enjoycrf> amirite
[09:26:50] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: For?
[09:26:59] <xec> enjoycrf: well, you could re bind events all the time, but i'd say delegates are much more elegant
[09:27:24] <Eviltwin> I believe delegates also let you stop the propogation of an event where live does not
[09:27:27] <jeffsmykil> so like i can do object.[propery[i]]
[09:27:28] <frankperez87> does live work with change
[09:27:28] <frankperez87> in IE
[09:27:29] <Eviltwin> But that's another issue
[09:27:38] <jeffsmykil> and that gives the value
[09:27:42] <ajpiano> frankperez87: on jquery 1.4 and above
[09:27:51] <jeffsmykil> but i cant get the property name by itself?
[09:28:03] <Eviltwin> frankperez87: object.x == object['x']
[09:28:04] <xec> frankperez87: i don't see why not, try it and see
[09:28:53] <Kambfhase> jeffsmykil: if you only have the value you'd have to for-in lopp over the object and search for it
[09:28:57] <Eviltwin> Sorry
[09:28:59] <jeffsmykil> k thanks
[09:29:04] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: object.x == object['x]
[09:29:08] <Eviltwin> object['x']
[09:29:49] <Mimoso98> IT WORKS!
[09:29:55] <Eviltwin> So I'm guessing you're looking for object[property[i]]
[09:29:56] <grid_> hey
[09:29:56] <xec> haha, gratz mate
[09:30:01] <Mimoso98> the Tables are moving as hell from one DIV to another one he he he
[09:30:11] <Mimoso98> xec, thanks again!
[09:30:21] <enjoycrf> and me?
[09:30:30] * xec hugs enjoycrf
[09:30:42] <aavikkojootti> i load form with ajax and ckeditor is not working
[09:30:47] <frankperez87> is there any place i can see the updates per version number
[09:31:18] <xec> frankperez87: you can see version added on each documentation page, http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[09:31:53] <DofLeFou> I m going nuts here
[09:32:03] <ajpiano> frankperez87: look up the blog posts for each release, they are all linked from here: http://docs.jquery.com/Downloading_jQuery
[09:32:10] <DofLeFou> I m using the DataTable plugin … a great plugin
[09:32:25] <ajpiano> btw 1.6.3RC1 is coming out later today
[09:32:33] <xec> ooh nice
[09:32:33] <ajpiano> for all of those who are interested in that type of thing
[09:32:38] <DofLeFou> but for some reason .. in IE the data table is just way too long
[09:32:45] <DofLeFou> anyone have seen this before
[09:32:52] <xec> whats new
[09:33:00] <DofLeFou> anything i could do to get it working in IE
[09:33:36] <xec> DofLeFou: do you have a live url?
[09:33:42] <ajpiano> xec:  we pulled requestAnimationFrame support, a little XSS fix, bugs in auto parsing data- attrs, etc
[09:34:19] <aaronmcadam> woop new javascript weekly arriving on my phone :) lovely fridays lol :D
[09:34:22] <DofLeFou> xec: not open to the public
[09:34:39] <DofLeFou> It works just fine in Chrome and FF
[09:34:59] <DofLeFou> and go badaboum in IE8
[09:35:10] <xec> BIG badaboom?
[09:35:26] <DofLeFou> just like that brother
[09:35:32] <DofLeFou> lol
[09:35:32] <AlexC_> are there any performance improvements between using "foo = new Image; foo.src = 'cake'" and "foo = $('<img src=cake />');" to preload images?
[09:36:13] <DofLeFou> is there an IRC channel out there for this DataTable
[09:36:21] <aaronmcadam> depends
[09:36:28] <ajpiano> AlexC_: the former obviously has less overhead
[09:36:35] <aaronmcadam> does jQuery use createElement or create a new Image object?
[09:36:41] <ajpiano> it uses createElement
[09:36:47] <aaronmcadam> cool
[09:37:06] <aaronmcadam> I always stay away from using the new Object in js
[09:37:20] <AlexC_> ajpiano: true
[09:37:23] <aaronmcadam> always use literals, but in the case of Image I'm not sure
[09:37:33] <ajpiano> new Image is fine if you need it
[09:37:43] <ajpiano> new Object is what you pretty much don't need to use ever
[09:37:48] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[09:37:53] <aaronmcadam> or new Array, etc etc
[09:38:28] <aaronmcadam> spose it depends what properties differ, if any of an Image object you might need
[09:38:35] <wtfmate> I've literally spent the last 6 hours trying to get a POST in jquery to also send the "Authorization: Basic abcd1234==" HTTP Header, and it doesn't seem to work.  It hates me.  Every result on Google hates me too.  Could someone here possibly help?
[09:39:10] <AlexC_> wtfmate: pastebin what you've tried
[09:39:20] <wtfmate> one min....
[09:39:49] <frankperez87> yeah live change works beautifully
[09:39:52] <frankperez87> thanks everyone
[09:40:41] <FakeHeal> hi, guys and girls, i came here to ask u one question, is there anyone who has ever used swfupload? :)
[09:41:08] <aaronmcadam> why are you still using flash ;) hehe
[09:41:27] <enjoycrf> just use a hidden frame
[09:41:58] <FakeHeal> if you have better solution I'll be glad to check it out! :)
[09:42:43] <wtfmate> HERE it is: http://pastebin.com/KbZNN210
[09:43:32] <wtfmate> any help would be SUPER appreciated! :)
[09:43:40] <AlexC_> wtfmate: and how do you know it's not setting this header?
[09:43:48] <wtfmate> Live Headers in FF
[09:44:00] <thepacmanfan2> how do i target an element within an iframe?
[09:45:07] <enjoycrf> liberate tu te me
[09:45:41] <wtfmate> when I set the "reg.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==")", the HTTP Method changes from POST to OPTIONS, WTF?!
[09:45:50] <jbrokc> is there a petter way to write $(this).parent().siblings().is("object") to test if ny of the parent's siblings are an object ?
[09:45:52] <enjoycrf> something like framename.window.dom
[09:46:02] <enjoycrf> or something
[09:46:17] <thepacmanfan2> gee, thanks
[09:46:25] <thepacmanfan2> :D
[09:46:32] <wtfmate> AlexC_: have you ever got something like this working?
[09:47:40] <wtfmate> I've tried it from both possible locations: file://  and http://127.0.0.1:8080/ (my local webserver)
[09:48:51] <wtfmate> so I guess what I'm wondering is, IS it jquery or the browser that is making this not possible??
[09:49:17] <wtfmate> Hours on Google and various forums
[09:49:18] <wtfmate> nothing
[09:49:30] <wtfmate> tried dozens of different variations, nothing.
[09:49:59] <wtfmate> tried to include the username:password in the http://username:password@127.0.0.1:8080/blah.php.....still nothing.
[09:51:41] <wtfmate> AlexC_:  I can pastebin the Live Headers output if you need it.
[09:54:38] <wtfmate> anyone else care to take a stabe at it?
[09:54:56] <energee> enjoycrf, for some reason hidden overflow does not stop text from flowing over the div
[09:55:40] <enjoycrf> i would really use length
[09:55:54] <ajpiano> wtfmate, seen the technique mentioned here? http://dothow.blogspot.com/2009/05/http-basic-authentication-with-jquery.html
[09:56:04] <enjoycrf> and strip the chars after a certain length and replace with ...
[09:56:16] <thepacmanfan2> $('iframe').contents() ???
[09:56:18] <enjoycrf> lol...
[09:57:40] <wtfmate> ajpiano: yes, I tried that part with "username: 'user', password: 'pass'" and that didn't work either.
[09:57:53] <ajpiano> did you try the base64 part....
[09:58:01] <wtfmate> I'm using "reg.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==")"
[09:58:15] <energee> enjoycrf, length?
[09:58:16] <wtfmate> (it's a hardcoded login for debug/testing... :)
[09:58:24] <enjoycrf> yeah like
[09:58:40] <wtfmate> reg.setRequestHeader("Authorization", "Basic dXNlcjpwYXNzd29yZA==")  // METHOD changes to OPTIONS, not POST!!
[09:58:43] <enjoycrf> if strlen > 10 substr()
[09:58:46] <wtfmate> reg.setRequestHeader("Accept", "text/plain; */*")  // METHOD uses POST as it should.
[09:58:50] <wtfmate> very, very strange.
[09:59:02] <ajpiano> wtfmate: are you trying to post to another domain other than your own????
[09:59:26] <wtfmate> nope: loading it from 127.0.0.1:8080
[09:59:52] <wtfmate> I tried setting crossDomain: "TRUE", when I was loading it from file://
[09:59:56] <wtfmate> but that didn't work either.
[10:00:07] <wtfmate> so neither file:// or http://127.0.0.1 is working.
[10:00:31] <wtfmate> The HTTP Method changing to be "OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1" is strange to me.
[10:00:55] <ajpiano> that whole "http method changing to options" is a telltale sign that you're trying to do xdomain stuff and you can't
[10:01:01] <HS^> hi, whats wrong with this:  $("#" + data).effect('highlight');
[10:01:08] <HS^> i want some element to light up
[10:01:23] <HS^> but the javascript doesnt even process this
[10:01:36] <wtfmate> so I can't post from say, 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.2??
[10:02:05] <ajpiano> nope
[10:02:09] <enjoycrf> see this is what hapens when ur nick is wtfmate
[10:02:10] <Kambfhase> HS^: what is data?
[10:02:20] <wtfmate> lol
[10:02:20] <jeffsmykil> eyes please?   $("." + type + " item").css({ "top": yLocation, "left": xLocation });
[10:02:50] * Kambfhase throws eyes at jeffsmykil
[10:03:01] <enjoycrf> my code is so beautiful
[10:03:05] <shesek> .item ?
[10:03:10] * cylence follows suit and passes his eyes to jeffsmykil
[10:03:20] <jeffsmykil> shesek: good call
[10:03:43] <jeffsmykil> still not taking the css though
[10:03:45] <jeffsmykil> wtf
[10:04:09] <Kambfhase> .offset ?
[10:04:30] <jeffsmykil> nah they are absolute positioned
[10:04:40] <jeffsmykil> but its not passing the values to the element in firebug
[10:04:54] <jeffsmykil> whether i put them in the append or not
[10:05:00] <HS^> Kamakazi it s an id
[10:05:09] <cylence> jeffsmykil: try scaling it down, replace your variables with explicit values - see if that works first.
[10:05:20] <jeffsmykil> cylence: good idea
[10:05:25] <Kambfhase> HS^: paste an example pls.
[10:05:45] <ajpiano> HS^: .effect is in jquery ui, do you actually have that...
[10:06:08] <jeffsmykil> cylence: weird, still not taking them
[10:06:16] <jeffsmykil> do i need a live event on the css?
[10:06:29] <Kambfhase> try appending px :o
[10:06:41] * jeffsmykil facepalms
[10:06:48] <HS^> ajpiano i run the drag and drop scripts
[10:06:53] <hemanth> is there a way to generate meaningful random words ( true sounds like an oxymoron ) ?
[10:06:55] <HS^> i guess that is also jquery ui?
[10:07:02] <ajpiano> but do you have the effects module
[10:07:10] <HS^> not sure actually
[10:07:20] <HS^> do you need to download is seperatly
[10:07:22] <jeffsmykil> wait even with pixels nothing
[10:07:27] <ajpiano> you may or may not
[10:07:32] <HS^> ehh..
[10:07:38] <HS^> how do i find out\
[10:08:05] <Kambfhase> check if $.fn.effect is defined
[10:10:11] <wtfmate> well, that still doesn't explain why OPTIONS is being used instead of POST
[10:10:49] <ajpiano> cause once you break the rules the rules gonna break you
[10:10:54] <ajpiano> you can't do an xdomain post
[10:11:01] <ajpiano> so as we say, shit happens.
[10:11:09] <ajpiano> <--untechnical explanation
[10:11:13] <HS^> Kambfhase ok. im a bit new to this.. i can just do alert($.fn.effect) ?
[10:11:15] <aaronmcadam> haha
[10:11:27] <Kambfhase> ?ftj @ HS^
[10:11:28] <cylence> jeffsmykil: Try this: $(".type .item").css({ top:"10px", left:"10px" }); (with an explicit type set)
[10:11:28] <bot-t1> HS^, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[10:11:29] <aaronmcadam> I wouldn't put yourself down ajpiano :P
[10:11:50] <cylence> jeffsmykil: do you use the console in your browser?
[10:12:01] <aaronmcadam> yes
[10:12:32] <aaronmcadam> Kambfhase: the guy who wrote that site sucks :p
[10:13:53] <HS^> firefox says $("#" + data).effect is not a function
[10:13:58] <Kambfhase> yeah, all the pros use alert()
[10:14:04] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[10:14:12] <Kambfhase> HS^: the means you did not load jQueryUI
[10:14:24] <aaronmcadam> how about alert( console.log( 'retarded' ) ); :D
[10:14:25] <wtfmate> I thought Web 2.0/HTML5 was going to allow XML/JSON postings across domains for shit like ad-network and content-providers??
[10:14:29] <HS^> but i can drag and drop
[10:14:40] <wtfmate> Or did I read that in a dream? ;)
[10:14:43] <ajpiano> HS^: jquery ui is a modular framework, you can have some parts of it and not others
[10:14:48] <HS^> oh shit
[10:14:50] <HS^> i see it now
[10:14:51] <Kambfhase> HS^: you didnt load the effects module then
[10:14:53] <HS^> let me try...
[10:14:59] <HS^> yea youre right
[10:15:06] <aaronmcadam> obviously :D
[10:15:43] <aaronmcadam> are u still as involved with ui these days ajpiano?
[10:15:46] <Kambfhase> console.log() is waaayyy too long.
[10:16:00] <ajpiano> kinda yeah
[10:16:03] <aaronmcadam> awesomes
[10:16:18] <aaronmcadam> you've taken over from paul as lead dev relations tho right?
[10:16:19] <ignotus> hi, how can I remove the max-height property of an element?  I tried $('#foo').css("max-height", false) etc but I could not make it work
[10:16:26] <Kambfhase> we should ask brendan about sugar syntax for console.log in ES.Next
[10:16:40] <wtfmate> is there any other way to force a HTTP Header then???
[10:17:03] <aaronmcadam> wtfmate: could u use a proxy maybe?
[10:17:22] <aaronmcadam> post your basic auth as json and build the request? sounds a bit messy but
[10:17:47] <wtfmate> perhaps
[10:18:04] <aaronmcadam> just an embryonic idea :)
[10:18:28] <aaronmcadam> what language are you using server side wtfmate
[10:18:35] <wtfmate> I just find it strange that you can't do a HTTP Basic auth
[10:18:36] <wtfmate> php
[10:18:51] <aaronmcadam> ben alman's written a php proxy module u might want to look at that
[10:18:54] <wtfmate> I could probably pass them as var's
[10:19:05] <ajpiano> wtfmate: it's not the auth part, it's the xdomain part
[10:19:10] <wtfmate> but that means changing a lot of other code
[10:19:18] <thebignoise> does anyone know the best way to copy text onclick.
[10:19:22] <aaronmcadam> yeah that's where he could use ben_alman's php module tho right
[10:19:30] <thebignoise> im using zclip but its messing up all my other jquery
[10:19:34] <wtfmate> It's their some X-Allow-Domain header I could set?
[10:20:09] <ajpiano> wtfmate: take a look through these slides and talk http://alexsexton.com/?p=154
[10:20:32] <chovy> Does anyone know how to process a stream like this with jQuery?
[10:20:33] <chovy> http://chovy.dyndns.org:1337/stream
[10:20:34] <aaronmcadam> thebignoise: have you tried just grabbing the text in a click event?
[10:20:35] <chovy> http://chovy.dyndns.org:8080/stream
[10:20:58] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: yeah sorry i didnt explain very well. i want to copy to clipboard
[10:21:05] <aaronmcadam> ahh gotcha
[10:21:18] <aaronmcadam> is it an old plugin?
[10:21:28] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: i dont think so
[10:21:31] <aaronmcadam> i *think* zurb released a plugin for it
[10:21:34] <wtfmate> reading post....
[10:21:38] <aaronmcadam> for that i mean
[10:21:56] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: yeah last realease was june 2011
[10:22:16] <aaronmcadam> actually is zclip the zurb one?
[10:23:07] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: im not entirely sure.
[10:23:26] <thebignoise> zclip uses flash
[10:23:27] <aaronmcadam> http://scriptsrc.net/ uses flash for copying
[10:24:23] <aaronmcadam> ZeroClipboard.swf?? thebignoise ?
[10:24:29] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: yup
[10:24:33] <aaronmcadam> right
[10:24:48] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam:  is that what scripsrc uses?
[10:24:58] <aaronmcadam> yup just inspected it in fbug
[10:25:19] <energee> having trouble using .length or similar to set an elements height to fit parent div
[10:25:19] <thebignoise> lol great that gets me no where
[10:25:25] <aaronmcadam> sorry brooo
[10:25:26] <energee> anyone mind taking a look?
[10:25:32] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: lol np thanx for the help
[10:25:33] <aaronmcadam> I did come across a clipboard plugin one time
[10:25:56] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: ill check out there jquery tho maybe i am using the plugin wrong
[10:26:38] <mwillhite> how I can get the time of an ajax response?
[10:26:45] <mwillhite> I'd like to pull it from the actual response if possible
[10:27:23] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: yea i have clearly messed up somewhere b/c right clicking on there (+)copy shows "about flash 10" mine doesnt
[10:27:30] <aaronmcadam> ahh
[10:27:37] <aaronmcadam> must not be firing then
[10:27:47] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: it is partially b/c the copy works
[10:27:55] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: it just bugs everything else out. lol
[10:28:16] <aaronmcadam> look inside this div in fbug: #d_clip_container_jquery
[10:28:29] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: k will do
[10:28:38] <aaronmcadam> that's where the elements are anyways
[10:33:36] <mwillhite> is there any sort of timestamp on the jqxhr object that comes down with an ajax response?
[10:34:20] <aaronmcadam> why can't u log the timestamp on the server side mwillhite
[10:34:31] <aaronmcadam> and pass that back in the returning data?
[10:34:58] <mwillhite> aaronmcadam: I'm hitting another api that doesn't give me that
[10:35:03] <aaronmcadam> gotcha
[10:35:22] <aaronmcadam> if u absolutely need it, why not hit a view that then calls the api
[10:35:33] <aaronmcadam> and append in the timestamp into the json
[10:35:35] <aaronmcadam> or whatever
[10:35:56] <mwillhite> yeah I can do something like that, just hoping for something directly tied to the response
[10:36:01] <aaronmcadam> yeah cool
[10:36:02] <mwillhite> I'm a little surprised it doesn't come with
[10:36:12] <mwillhite> thanks tho
[10:36:17] <aaronmcadam> no worries
[10:36:36] <aaronmcadam> i might do, but i presume you've already inspected the response in firebug
[10:36:52] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: ive come to the conclusion i have either screwed up my own jquery or there is conflict between zclip and mine b/c its implemented just like scripsrc's now
[10:36:55] <mwillhite> yeah, been digging through it, really I'm just being lazy
[10:37:06] <thebignoise> aaronmcadam: thank you for the help tho
[10:37:25] <chovy> anyone know how to read a stream with jquery?
[10:37:47] <aaronmcadam> hmm no prob thebignoise
[10:38:11] <mod> hmm none of the examples that use the 'onsubmit' or 'oncomplete' attributes show examples of using that attribute
[10:38:15] <mod> oops
[10:38:23] <pootpoot> whats the best way to find the next div with class x within the entire page structure
[10:39:53] <pootpoot> i could do $('#content').find() but is there a way to specify to look after a certain div
[10:40:14] <mwillhite> btw xhr.getResponseHeader('Date')
[10:40:36] <mwillhite> totally works
[10:40:59] <aaronmcadam> excellent
[10:49:10] <keystr0k> I'm using elements.bind('change', function() { }) on a select list to detect a change… anyone know how to do something if the SAME option is chosen that is already the value?
[10:49:22] <keystr0k> change only fires if a different option is chosen
[10:49:52] <mwillhite> keystr0k: maybe look at the focus even instead?
[10:49:58] <keystr0k> mwillhite: will do. thx
[10:50:04] <mwillhite> depending on your needs of course…
[10:58:33] <enjoycrf> holy shit look at what i jus did
[10:58:49] <enjoycrf> preg_replace('/#([\w_]+)#/e', '($property[$1]) ? $property[$1] : "#".$1."#"', $stockobj->children[$i]->layername)
[10:59:18] <enjoycrf> r u seeing this maddness
[10:59:40] <aaronmcadam> i'm choosing to ignore that monstrosity
[11:00:44] <enjoycrf> isnt that crazy
[11:00:53] <g0rd0n> i have a set of radio buttons and would like jquery to react when one of them is pressed, allowing me to play with the name of the selected radio button so i can pass it on... how can i do this?
[11:00:54] <enjoycrf> i jus eliminated a billion loops w one line
[11:01:05] <enjoycrf> lol
[11:01:37] <enjoycrf> all my new websites are going to be one line
[11:01:49] <enjoycrf> of code
[11:02:49] <Deafgoose> Hi guys can anyone give me a hand with this? http://pastebin.com/iiJaVmnJ It just dies silently and the select box is not getting updated
[11:03:50] <enjoycrf> from extreme sports comes extreme coding lol
[11:06:31] <TheAbacus> When I look at the "Download" jQuery button on jquery.com it says it is 31kb minified and gzipped. When I click "download" it opens the file and if I right-click it is 31kb. However, if I save the file to my desktop it is 94kb. I assume it has something to do with being gzipped...how exactly do I get it to be 31kb?
[11:10:43] <Soopaman> TheAbacus: that magic is handled by your server and the browser
[11:11:02] <enjoycrf> i think im having a heart attack from folgers cofe
[11:17:58] <aaronmcadam> TheAbacus: gzip is set by apache or nginx
[11:18:05] <aaronmcadam> or whatever server you're using
[11:20:37] <tvaldes> I built a small system which warns an inactive user their session is about to expire, and it gives them a few options (stay logged in, extend for 15 mins, and logout). This works great in 1 window, but when there are multiple tabs open, even allowing 1 tab to expire will end the PHP session. Can this be solved without managing all session info in a backend DB and some heavy ajax? And.. is this the right place for this question?
[11:21:26] <aaronmcadam> node node node :D
[11:21:47] <aaronmcadam> #Node.js is
[11:22:05] <aaronmcadam> why extend for 15 mins tho?
[11:22:10] <aaronmcadam> is it a banking system?
[11:22:51] <tvaldes> well the PHP session is 24 mins.. gives them plenty of time to pick an option. It's HIPAA regulated personal info :)
[11:23:05] <aaronmcadam> what the fook is that
[11:23:48] <tvaldes> I haven't had a good reason to mess with server-side js.. I guess this is a good time.
[11:23:59] <frankperez87> I have a question, when i add a textarea using the .html method to a page, i am unable to click into the textarea and edit. Anyone know anything about this?
[11:24:10] <aaronmcadam> perfect use case tvaldes
[11:24:28] <tvaldes> Hipaa is Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act... govern's health info privacy in the US :)
[11:25:38] <frankperez87> Do i need to do anything special in order to allow the DOM to see it as a workable textarea
[11:26:02] <tvaldes> aaronmcadam: Thanks for your advice, I'm off to explore node :)
[11:26:33] <EMKO> on my page i click login and this opens a iframe using colorbox and in the iframe i click a button this loads a window.open popup how can i change the url of the iframe from my popup window?
[11:31:19] <justsomedood> I have an onclick handler for an <input type="radio">, the function does a jquery selector like $("input[name="elementname"]:checked").val()   to find out the clicked value.  In Opera this isn't always the currently selected value, but one of the previously selected values, but in Firefox I can't duplicate.  Has anyone seen a problem like this?
[11:32:00] <draginx> Is there anyway to subtract 15% on a css width? O_o
[11:32:16] <draginx> im setting the css width to 100% but then calling .css('width') actually grabs the px form
[11:33:50] <draginx> $('#energy_perc')[0].style.getPropertyValue("width"); for those wondering how do it :P
[11:42:41] <sanguisdex> are there any plugins for firebug or webkit that will show js that affectes the dom element inspected, like it does for css?
[11:45:01] <robertj> how can I remove the close button from a .dialog()?
[11:55:32] <g0rd0n> damn... i am having a problem with jqueryui's buttonset. i have jqueryui tabs which load content via ajax, in the first tab i ahve a buttonset that works fine, but in the second tab the buttonset reports wrong val() even though the button set has different id and names... very weird
[11:58:54] <TehShrike|Work> I have a JSON object of key/value pairs.  I'm iterating over it with $.each(), but when I access them, I'm getting them ordered by the key, instead of in their original order.  Is there anything I can do go prevent this?
[12:01:32] <Z3R0> how do I remove my class off the previous selected <A> http://jsfiddle.net/RW5LX/ ?
[12:02:16] <TehShrike|Work> Z3R0: http://api.jquery.com/removeAttr/
[12:02:59] <henrikh> Hello, I've got a problem but I'm not sure that jQuery can actually solve it. I need to fetch some data from my server and return it directly: Ie: no callbacks can be used!!! How should I go about solving this problem?
[12:03:40] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: so you want space-time to warp between when you contact the server and when the response gets returned?
[12:04:17] <JAAulde> that would be bad ass
[12:04:23] <JAAulde> can you arrange that, TehShrike|Work
[12:04:32] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: you want this server request to appear synchronous?
[12:04:37] <henrikh> That's one way, however I will accept blocking everything else and wait for the data to return
[12:04:40] <TehShrike|Work> JAAulde: ;-P
[12:04:59] <henrikh> Yes, being asynchronous is not necessary
[12:05:16] <henrikh> Everything else has to wait for the data to return
[12:05:29] <Z3R0> TehShrike|Work: I know removeAttr and removeClass however, how do I reference the other <A> Tags?
[12:05:47] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: So you want to block user input until the request returns.
[12:05:57] <TehShrike|Work> Z3R0: to do what?
[12:06:44] <henrikh> Yes, it's only for now, since I'm just testing things. If I were to implement callbacks, it would require re-engineering a lot of things. Right now I just want a proof of concept
[12:06:45] <Z3R0> my navigation... 6 tabs, select one (is based on the <A> tag of that tab), how do I reference the other 5 tags to removeAttr for the active class
[12:07:14] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: There are various ways to block user input with loading dialogs or messages, I'd Google for them
[12:07:29] <Z3R0> blockUI is nice lol
[12:07:56] <TehShrike|Work> Z3R0: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[12:08:22] <henrikh> Hmm, I don't think you understand. I'm not looking for a way to block input. I'm looking for a way to make a request and return the content directly without using callbacks
[12:08:45] <TehShrike|Work> Z3R0: Perhaps $('a [class!="active"]')
[12:08:56] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:09:10] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: Ctrl+F for "async"
[12:09:36] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: documentation ftw.
[12:10:03] <TehShrike|Work> So... can anyone help me with my object ordering issue?
[12:10:20] <henrikh> TehShrike|Work: Wont async need a callback?
[12:10:28] <henrikh> TehShrike|Work: May I hear again?
[12:10:36] <TehShrike|Work> I have a JSON object of key/value pairs.  I'm iterating over it with $.each(), but when I access them, I'm getting them ordered by the key, instead of in their original order.  Is there anything I can do go prevent this?
[12:11:24] <henrikh> TehShrike|Work: You can't. Chrome and some other browsers reorder objects (in reality there is no guarantee of the order in any browsers)
[12:11:26] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: you don't want to put your "do this when the response gets back" code in an inline function?  Why not?
[12:11:38] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: aah, that's dumb. :-(
[12:11:53] <Z3R0> TehShrike|Work: Any other ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/RW5LX/2/ // both types failed
[12:11:56] <henrikh> If you want order you should use an array, possibly as an index
[12:12:23] <TehShrike|Work> Z3R0: that's... not right
[12:12:26] <henrikh> TehShrike|Work: No, I can't do that because of the architecture of the code I'm working with :(
[12:12:37] <TehShrike|Work> Z3R0: did you see what I typed to you before, or that link to the docs?
[12:12:49] <henrikh> Maybe I should just look into cleaning the code up
[12:12:53] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: you could wrap it up easily enough, I guess
[12:13:08] <Z3R0> I understand selectors, my problem is, that there is already a link <A> that has the "active" tag... (I need to find that link and remove it...)
[12:13:32] <Z3R0> but the trigger I'm working with is the "new" <A> selected...
[12:13:52] <Z3R0> do I need to back out, and select by the UL and not the A ?>
[12:14:22] <AaaL> hello
[12:14:26] <andriy> Hello
[12:14:32] <andriy> Can someone help me with jquery?
[12:14:39] <AaaL> Yes
[12:14:46] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: http://pastebin.com/0MGQGvDw ?
[12:15:04] <andriy> AaaL
[12:15:10] <andriy> Im just a newbie with Jquery
[12:15:19] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: you could call something like that from your current code
[12:15:20] <andriy> I made a script for Resize 2 divs
[12:15:23] <henrikh> TehShrike|Work: Ahhh!!!! of course!
[12:15:28] <andriy> and I cant get it work on my own server
[12:15:30] <henrikh> Thanks a lot :)
[12:15:35] <andriy> I got it working on jsdfiddle
[12:15:52] <henrikh> I can see that it makes perfect sense :) I hope you figure out your issue. I've got to run
[12:15:53] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: It's a simple (unnecessary) wrapper, you could generalize it more if you wanted :-)
[12:15:58] <TehShrike|Work> henrikh: thanks!
[12:16:14] <andriy> This is my jquery script: http://caltxaco.com/site/wp-content/themes/blankslate/resize.js
[12:16:52] <andriy> My site have that 2 divs, but it dont works, and In jsfiddle it works
[12:17:12] <TehShrike|Work> andriy: are you sure that height is a function and not a property?
[12:17:48] <andriy> I dont know. This is my first time with Jquery.
[12:18:14] <Z3R0> TehStrike|Work: http://jsfiddle.net/RW5LX/4/ -- Works like this, don't know if this is the correct way or not
[12:18:19] <andriy> But in Jsfiddle it works
[12:18:23] <andriy> and In my site it dont works
[12:18:41] <AaaL> andriy: JS rus in browser not on server, so if it stop working after moving to another place the problem  may be in PATHs
[12:18:41] <jcDesigns> hello
[12:18:53] <Z3R0> andriy: did you actually include the Jquery*.js file in your html ?
[12:19:13] <jcDesigns> got a question on why something is done on a flyout menu

[12:19:39] <andriy> http://caltxaco.com/site/
[12:20:04] <jcDesigns> why would one set the css to this: .css({visibility : "visible", display : "none"}).show(400);
[12:20:23] <jcDesigns> who make it visible, then hide it, then show it again?
[12:20:33] <jcDesigns> damn, meant why, not who
[12:21:03] <Z3R0> lol jcDesigns  that's kinda funny
[12:21:11] <jcDesigns> i understand that show only works with display, but why use visibility at all
[12:21:23] <andriy> Guys any suggestions??

[12:39:24] <simonleojung> andriy: http://jsfiddle.net/bR4tK/ not sure if that's what you wanted
[12:40:19] <andriy> @simonleojung If I wanna to add padding, but I wanna add the difference between that 2 divs and 100 px more
[12:41:40] <Z3R0> his fiddle works fine in js, and all links on his site are correct (dev tools) proved that they do correspond to active files...
[12:42:29] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/0hCKX1Eb how come this isn't working in Safari ?
[12:42:33] <andriy> @Z3R0  So whats the problem??
[12:42:47] <Z3R0> wait
[12:42:50] <Z3R0> andriy
[12:42:53] <Z3R0> your sidebar2
[12:43:36] <Z3R0> is 168x1300 // and your content is 600 x 1222
[12:43:41] <Z3R0> so your sidebar IS increasing
[12:43:52] <andriy> mmmm
[12:44:19] <Z3R0> are you sure you're thinknig of the right bar?
[12:44:27] <Z3R0> sidebar2 just has a textbox on it
[12:45:41] <simonleojung> andriy: what about this http://jsfiddle.net/bR4tK/1/
[12:46:18] <Z3R0> simonleojung: his code IS working on his site
[12:46:24] <Z3R0> just not the way he intended apparently
[12:46:50] <simonleojung> Z3R0: thanks wasn't sure what he wanted exactly
[12:47:07] <smykes42> .
[12:47:09] <Z3R0> he's trying to "elongate" the side bar based on the contents of the div (so it's dynamic)
[12:47:12] <andriy> @Z3R0
[12:47:27] <gataraid> http://pastebin.com/0hCKX1Eb how come this isn't working in Safari ?
[12:47:30] <andriy> @Z3R0 I just added 1000 padding, lets see if it works
[12:47:46] <darcyclarke> gataraid make a test case in jsfiddle.net
[12:47:48] <andriy> @Z3r0 not it donts
[12:47:57] <darcyclarke> your pastebin does nothing fkor us
[12:48:13] <Z3R0> sidebar2.height = 1300, content.height= 1222
[12:48:18] <Z3R0> your content isn't big enough to pass that chcek
[12:48:52] <Z3R0> content.height is currently LESS THAN sidebar2.height
[12:49:21] <simonleojung> sup darcy
[12:49:30] <darcyclarke> simonleojung is the man!

[13:00:32] <darcyclarke> :)
[13:00:42] <darcyclarke> I codez the jquereez

[13:00:55] <Deafgoose> Hi, all, Im returning a string off a db via json, data looks like this : (["trafficsources","domain1.de,domain2.de"]); Now I have a select box with both these options, however I would like to set them to selected using jquery, select box on its default it looks like this: http://pastebin.com/U42zidiL
[13:01:00] <Z3R0> well then... I have one for you
[13:01:04] <darcyclarke> removed the console.log http://jsfiddle.net/darcyclarke/gH78j/7/

[13:01:45] <darcyclarke> :)
[13:02:12] <gataraid> darcy you know I had a $.change question
[13:02:18] <andriy> @Z3R0 Im back. I just quit the height in .sidebar2
[13:02:19] <gataraid> I think you killed two birds with one stone sir
[13:02:42] <enjoycrf> i think he kill every bird
[13:03:01] <andriy> @Z3R0 Do you still here?
[13:03:10] <queuetip> i have a bunch of links that all have the same class but different ids, i'm binding a click event to the class and passing a var through the function, my question is, how can i get the id of the anchor?
[13:03:14] <enjoycrf> i do
[13:03:26] <darcyclarke> gataraid your welcome
[13:03:31] <darcyclarke> pass on the favor
[13:03:39] <Z3R0> content: 1322 height, sidebar2: 1222 height
[13:03:45] <gataraid> darcyclarke: I was just about to say thank you sir
[13:03:52] <darcyclarke> :P
[13:03:56] <Z3R0> darcy any thoughts on the fiddle above?
[13:04:02] <darcyclarke> what about?
[13:04:05] <darcyclarke> optimization?
[13:04:07] <Z3R0> *oh wise master of the quereez*
[13:04:07] <darcyclarke> lemme look
[13:04:52] <Z3R0> queuetip look at using data in the link
[13:05:05] <queuetip> Z3R0: what do you mean?
[13:05:15] <queuetip> to preface my question, i suck at front end stuff :|
[13:05:17] <Z3R0> <a data-id="#"> // $(this).data('id') // get id value
[13:05:47] <queuetip> Z3R0: that works like that?
[13:05:56] <Z3R0> yep, I just learned that 2 days ago now, but I use it
[13:06:07] <queuetip> Z3R0: does that work cross browser?
[13:06:14] <Z3R0> iono
[13:06:23] <Z3R0> I was told by someone smart here to do it that way
[13:06:41] <Z3R0> so I would assume if it's not cross browser, it's at least, cross browser (that everyone should have else they be shot)
[13:06:43] <queuetip> Z3R0: i'll do some research on it, is there a bot in this channel that can post a link on that?
[13:07:05] <Deafgoose> Hi, all, Im returning a string off a db via json, data looks like this : (["trafficsources","domain1.de,domain2.de"]); Now I have a select box with both these options, however I would like to set them to selected using jquery, select box on its default it looks like this: http://pastebin.com/U42zidiL
[13:07:19] <Z3R0> http://www.javascriptkit.com/dhtmltutors/customattributes.shtml
[13:07:31] <queuetip> Z3R0: thanks!
[13:07:34] <Z3R0> ? data
[13:07:34] <bot-t1> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:07:37] <gataraid> darcyclarke: what's $.bind ?
[13:07:44] <Z3R0> bind is similar to .click
[13:07:51] <gataraid> it binded the $.change?
[13:07:59] <gataraid> oh
[13:08:01] <Z3R0> it binded the .change()
[13:08:05] <Z3R0> to the element
[13:08:08] <gataraid> Ah
[13:08:29] <queuetip> Z3R0: ahh it's html 5, i'm not sure i'll be able to use it for what I need, too many people are still using older browsers that don't support html5 i believe
[13:08:45] <Z3R0> ah, well then... you could look at ... uh
[13:08:47] <darcyclarke> Z3RO it's fine... I guess maybe this: http://jsfiddle.net/darcyclarke/RW5LX/6/
[13:09:09] <Z3R0> could always get the text of the link and filter to the function ?
[13:09:19] <darcyclarke> gataraid bind works just like .change(function(){ .... }) or .click(function(){ .... })
[13:09:24] <gataraid> darcyclarke: does it put the options in an array ?
[13:09:25] <darcyclarke> but it's faster
[13:09:33] <gataraid> Ooooh
[13:09:39] <gataraid> I see it's faster
[13:09:49] <Z3R0> $('.link').bind('click',function() { alert(this).html; }); // lol
[13:09:55] <queuetip> Z3R0: i'm already passing a var to the function like this:  $(".edit_field").bind('click', function(obj)  but i'm not sure what property of my var "obj" will have what i need
[13:10:13] <queuetip> Z3R0: but that might work well actually
[13:10:34] <darcyclarke> well because doing $('someElement').click(function(){ ... }) just does a $('someElement').bind('click', function(){ ... });  so you loose one unnecessary method call
[13:10:41] <andriy> @Z3R0 I got hte script working on the home, but still not working on the post http://caltxaco.com/site/post-con-image/
[13:10:42] <gataraid> so the variable el turns into an array?
[13:10:47] <queuetip> Z3R0: i'll try out checking this.html because that might be perfect for what i need
[13:10:55] <andriy> @Z3R0 In the home it works perfect
[13:11:33] <Z3R0> hmmmm you're right
[13:12:24] <Z3R0> ah
[13:12:32] <darcyclarke> Z3RO do some perf tests with what you had and this: http://jsfiddle.net/darcyclarke/RW5LX/6/
[13:12:49] <Z3R0> ya darcy help andriy  poor guys been trying but I can't figure out what's wrong
[13:13:02] <Z3R0> wtf is a perftest?
[13:13:48] <darcyclarke> http://jsperf.com/
[13:13:51] <darcyclarke> performance test
[13:14:01] <darcyclarke> check the performance of the one solution compared to the other
[13:14:05] <tash1> can someone look at this please? I think it's probably something that someone who has been doing this for a while can easily answer. I'm very very new to jQ http://pastie.org/2435344
[13:14:12] <darcyclarke> I didn't see anything gastly with your initial code Z3RO
[13:14:31] <darcyclarke> andriy send me your test fiddle
[13:14:40] <darcyclarke> and tell me what you want it to do
[13:16:20] <andriy> @darcyclarke Fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/VuFk5/1/ Website: http://caltxaco.com/site Js: http://caltxaco.com/site/resize.js What it does? If Content is bigger than Sidebar, it adds the difference and 100 px of padding-bottom to the sidebar. Problem: First It doesnt work. Now I got It working but only on home, not in the post, like this one: http://caltxaco.com/site/post-con-image/
[13:17:09] <gataraid> oh wow
[13:17:13] <gataraid> jsperf is neat
[13:19:01] <darcyclarke> andriy
[13:19:15] <darcyclarke> its because you are binding to the DOM ready
[13:19:22] <darcyclarke> you shoudl wait until the entire window has loaded
[13:19:30] <darcyclarke> because images could effect height
[13:20:18] <darcyclarke> andriy try something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/darcyclarke/VuFk5/2/
[13:20:35] <darcyclarke> so it will fire the DOM loaded then the window loaded
[13:21:04] <Z3R0> darcy on that perf thing, do I implement css straight into the HTML there as text?
[13:21:36] <darcyclarke> do you need css?
[13:21:47] <darcyclarke> just do inline I guess
[13:21:53] <Z3R0> well I would assume so, since it's changing the style of the element only
[13:22:07] <darcyclarke> you're adding a class and removing a class no?
[13:22:16] <darcyclarke> just check how fast that is
[13:22:20] <Z3R0> oh ok
[13:22:51] <andriy> @darcyclarke Mmmm OMFG! YOU'RE GOD BRO!
[13:22:52] <Z3R0> what is async ?
[13:23:01] <darcyclarke> andriy :P
[13:23:04] <darcyclarke> your welcome
[13:23:07] <andriy> @darcyclarke It works bro!!! @Z3R0 Thanks you for the help! Thanks all for the help :)
[13:23:20] <Z3R0> darcy is the "something" man? woman? thing?
[13:23:37] <andriy> From tomorrow I gonna learn jquery. And Im learning python too :P
[13:26:26] <Z3R0> @darcyclarke: I can't get it to work // tests just say pending... and nothing
[13:27:28] <darcyclarke> lol
[13:27:34] <darcyclarke> its not automated
[13:27:45] <darcyclarke> your test
[13:27:52] <darcyclarke> should be automated
[13:28:02] <Z3R0> I figured it out
[13:28:05] <darcyclarke> k
[13:28:07] <Z3R0> was including the library wrong
[13:28:08] <Z3R0> now
[13:28:36] <Z3R0> ok
[13:28:43] <Z3R0> jsperf = awesome, darcy = god
[13:29:16] <tash1> anyone have a chance to look at my pastie? confused
[13:29:18] <Z3R0> the .end() you did, backed out of the previous parent element ?
[13:29:24] <Z3R0> repastie ?
[13:30:36] <tash1> Z3R0: not sure if you are talking to me or not, but here it is if so http://pastie.org/2435344
[13:30:50] <Z3R0> ya i found it
[13:31:10] <plainas> hey all
[13:31:11] <Z3R0> why not disable the submit button if match found ?
[13:31:34] <tash1> Z3R0: b/c I didn't think of that :P
[13:31:34] <darcyclarke> tash1 make fiddle?
[13:32:10] <rajeshp> I'm using this to put a dropdown mutliselect, and when I hit the submit, I'm only getting one checked value even though three or four are selected...can some one please tell me where I'm going wrong...http://pastie.org/2435426
[13:32:22] <plainas> So I'm thinking of improvising a simple browser based terminal (command line), there's a plugin that does exactly this, but it has too many features... I want to roll my own, for fun I guess
[13:32:40] <darcyclarke> rajeshp jsfiddle.net test case or gtho
[13:32:46] <andriy> @darcyclarke Last question: for add the same padding of the sidebar2, to another div called #fondo: this would be the code to add?   el3.css('margin-top', (el1.height() - el2.height()) + 100);
[13:33:13] <Z3R0> if you were going to do that, I would push that calculation into a variable
[13:33:20] <plainas> how is that done? I guess I keep append text to a div... but how to I get the cursor blinking on the tip of the text?
[13:33:22] <Z3R0> and 'reuse' the value, rather than re-calculate
[13:33:38] <andriy> @Z3R0 How would I make that?
[13:34:05] <Z3R0> var myvar = el.height() - el2.height() + 100; //
[13:34:14] <Z3R0> use as myvar instead of gibberish
[13:34:30] <rajeshp> darcyclarke I'm new to ajax and jquery, can u please suggest...do I have to have another method which modifies the field when a text box is selected? I'm using this plugin http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/
[13:39:00] <darcyclarke> rajeshp look up "Retrieve values on the server?"
[13:39:42] <darcyclarke> you need to pass that value as an array
[13:39:59] <Deafgoose> Hi guys, can anyone help me with this problem? I am returning a json value ex: "source":"domain1,domain2,domain3" as you can see the string is separated by commas, how can I make the matching values of a multi select list selected based on this returned json string?
[13:40:47] <darcyclarke> rajeshp so name="distribution_channel_id_filter" should be name="distribution_channel_id_filter[]"
[13:43:21] <rajeshp> awesome!!!! darcyclarke putting [ ] worked like a magic
[13:44:02] <darcyclarke> rajeshp apparently I'm magic today ;)
[13:44:05] <darcyclarke> your welcome
[13:44:10] <Deafgoose> Hi guys, can anyone help me with this problem? I am returning a json value ex: "source":"domain1,domain2,domain3" as you can see the string is separated by commas, how can I make the matching values of a multi select list selected based on this returned json string?
[13:44:57] <darcyclarke> Deafgoose you're using the same multiselect widget? http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/jquery-ui-multiselect-widget/
[13:45:10] <Deafgoose> darcyclarke no
[13:45:27] <Deafgoose> well I have a static select
[13:45:43] <darcyclarke> jsfiddle.net example please
[13:45:52] <Deafgoose> alright one minute
[13:46:04] <darcyclarke> can be simple without the ajax request
[13:46:23] <tash1> Z3R0: how would I disable the submit button? sorry =\
[13:46:29] <Wizek> hey there
[13:46:40] <Wizek> Anyone here using qunit?
[13:47:10] <darcyclarke> tash1 $(el).attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[13:48:01] <tash1> darcyclark: thanks, but just curious, why two disabled's ?
[13:48:24] <darcyclarke> the first is the name of the attribute the second is the value
[13:48:39] <Z3R0> yea I was about to say that lol
[13:48:40] <darcyclarke> <input type="submit" disabled='disabled'> is the same thing
[13:48:56] <Z3R0> sometimes you can do 'disabled',true) but not all browsers lke that
[13:49:16] <Deafgoose> darcyclarke http://pastebin.com/6WS8DSf4 this is the html
[13:49:38] <Z3R0> you guys need to get away from pastebin and use jsfiddle
[13:49:40] <Deafgoose> if the data returned has for example, domain1.de,domain2.de I want those selected
[13:49:50] <Deafgoose> Z3R0 sorry
[13:50:06] <Z3R0> hard to tell what's going on without a working example
[13:50:37] <Deafgoose> well unfortunately I dont have a working example, Im trying to do it right now :(
[13:52:25] <detain> is there a difference or purpose in  a function being defined like       var name = function() {}      vs just     function name() {}      ?
[13:52:40] <Wizek> Or, if not QUnit, then any other client-side testing framework?

[13:56:09] <enjoycrf> doood who keeps writing silly ass code i hav to fix
[13:56:17] <enjoycrf> this is really annoying plz stop
[13:56:59] <Deafgoose> darcyclarke will try that out
[13:57:46] <darcyclarke> Deafgoose should work just fine... if it's some kind of multiselect widget you're using you can add an extra param to the <input> element you create while looping through your domains
[13:58:06] <darcyclarke> Deafgoose in order to have those options selected
[13:58:58] <detain> thanks
[13:59:29] <rajeshp> hey darcyclarke , say if I want the options to be populated dynamically from a column in my database, what is the bestway to do that can u refer me to some reading material or some sort of documentation
[14:01:12] <Z3R0> $.post() and .append() ?
[14:04:07] <enjoycrf> STOP!
[14:04:43] <daekano> Using Fancybox, if I trigger a click event via console the fancybox opens as it should. Clicking on the link itself yields no behavior. Any thoughts?
[14:09:32] <potatodemon> How can I condense something like this -- if (foo != undefined){ bar = foo }else{ bar = "default" };
[14:09:44] <daekano> use the ternary operator?
[14:11:23] <razzi> bar = foo || "default";
[14:14:02] <jdevel> potatodemon, (foo!==undefined)?bar=foo:bar=default;
[14:15:06] <enjoycrf> thats wrong
[14:15:11] <enjoycrf> its bad =

[14:16:10] <wreel> hey all, i'm looking for some guidance. i'm very new to web programming and have some rows of data being displayed by fetching them with jquery (through json). the rows have a checkbox and when it's checked, i want to submit data back to a receiving program to update the state of that checkbox in my backend db. is this a case for $(selector).load(...) or do i need to use $.ajax(...)? or something else entirely
[14:17:38] <razzi> wreel, .post probly
[14:19:26] <wreel> razzi, thanks, that looks more straight-forward
[14:21:30] <streblo> can someone tell me why a piece of code like this doesnt work: http://dpaste.com/603405/
[14:21:37] <streblo> the call to addClass never adds the class
[14:22:41] <daekano> ugh this click problem is unfiriating
[14:22:47] <daekano> infuriating, too
[14:23:13] <razzi> streblo, cuz your array is an array of strings and not array of dom elements
[14:24:13] <streblo> razzi: oh, doy. you have to do $.each(array, fn); right?
[14:25:27] <razzi> i see what you try to do, but i am not confident about my knownledge of this inside a jquery method
[14:25:40] <razzi> it probably always have to be a dom element, but again not sure
[14:25:47] <razzi> maybe the more experienced guys can answer
[14:25:50] <streblo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[14:26:38] <enjoycrf> i can haz it?
[14:27:34] <razzi> enjoycrf fy, it's not allowed to make fun of people on freenode.
[14:27:39] <razzi> fyi*
[14:27:50] <enjoycrf> ?
[14:28:14] <enjoycrf> el problemas?
[14:28:25] <razzi> nvm, i thought you made fun of my typing mistakes
[14:28:41] <enjoycrf> es no problem
[14:29:08] <SirCmpwn> woah, first time I've seen the same person on two networks
[14:29:11] <SirCmpwn> this is exciting
[14:29:26] <razzi> who did you see?
[14:29:42] <SirCmpwn> you.
[14:30:06] <SirCmpwn> I believe you are also in #php on EFNet
[14:31:55] <enjoycrf> u dont want to go to #php
[14:56:29] <tktiddle> is it possible to fade in a background image using animate?
[14:57:41] <tktiddle> i.e have backbround set to white then animate({'background':'url("some.img")'})?
[14:58:45] <jdevel> you could treat it as a div, with a lower index than everything else and do it.

[15:18:34] <draginx> If I have a setTimeout() function that goes off every second (within the function it resets the settimeout) and this code is brought up through ajax… how can I make it so if i keep clicking the ajax link it wont "stack up" the jquery calls
[15:18:43] <draginx> err stack up the setitmeout calls
[15:19:05] <ajpiano>  you have to "debounce" it draginx
[15:19:10] <ajpiano> ?debounce
[15:19:11] <bot-t> Ben Alman » jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[15:19:25] <ajpiano> draginx: you basically can just make it so the timeout cancels existing timeout first
[15:19:37] <draginx>     if (typeof the_clock != undefined) {
[15:19:37] <draginx>       clearTimeout(the_clock);
[15:19:40] <draginx> i essentially added that
[15:19:49] <ajpiano> yeah i prefer to do something like
[15:20:09] <draginx> this is interesting :) thanks ajpiano :D
[15:20:11] <ajpiano> var t;  t && clearTimeout(t); t = setTimeout(fn, delay);
[15:20:19] <draginx> yer
[15:21:47] <dabear> underscores in variables is sooo 1999
[15:23:01] <draginx> lol
[15:24:08] <jdevel> yea mostly camel case now

[15:48:49] <queuetip> i asked this earlier but never really got a clear answer - without using html5 custom data attributes, i have several anchors that all have share a class, all of these anchors have a unique id, i'm binding click to the class, but how can i get which id was clicked?
[15:49:54] <queuetip> right now it looks like this, but i'm not finding anything out of my var obj that will get me the id: $(".edit_field").bind('click', function(obj) {
[15:52:46] <darcyclarke> queuetip one sec
[15:53:03] <queuetip> darcyclarke: otay :P
[15:54:00] <draginx> is there a way to figure out how many seconds have passed from loading the page till domComplete?
[15:54:34] <^robertj> hello all, can anyone tlel me what is causing the output window to "bounce" on ie? http://webclient.caskeytranscription.com/ works fine in firefox but in ie when i press a key or hover out of the input field it scrolls the window to the top

[16:13:57] <jdevel> is there a better way to get the child elements than this.. this.find('>img,>div,>a');
[16:15:26] <darcyclarke> jdevel think thats pretty solid
[16:15:36] <jdevel> excellent
[16:15:44] <jdevel> thanks for looking at it
[16:16:06] <razzi> what about .chilren()?
[16:16:31] <jdevel> I only want top level children
[16:16:45] <razzi> that's what children means
[16:16:52] <razzi> vs. descendants
[16:17:03] <jdevel> indeed
[16:17:11] <jdevel> however wouldn't that also grab other elements?
[16:17:23] <jdevel> and not restrict to the ones I've selected?
[16:17:49] <jdevel> I imagine I would then have to filter the results
[16:17:50] <razzi> you can pass a selector
[16:17:54] <jdevel> ah hah
[16:18:01] <jdevel> better performance ?
[16:18:15] <razzi> dunno
[16:18:27] <jdevel> that will be the key then
[16:18:49] <jdevel> know of anything to test something like that rather than outputting nano seconds or whatever?
[16:19:07] <razzi> probably no difference since your selector is explicit it only wants children
[16:47:07] <jdevel> anyone preparing for the hurricane in the US?
[16:47:41] <WILDsharustar> Im west coast

[16:50:19] <ajpiano> heh yeah, i'm in midtown manhattan
[16:50:24] <ajpiano> it's like, a weird vibe all over town
[16:50:28] <jdevel> yea
[16:50:45] <jdevel> people are still shaken up about the earth quake
[16:51:02] <ajpiano> meh, not really
[16:51:12] <jdevel> at least it seems it's affecting their attitudes toward the hurricane
[16:51:39] <ajpiano> yah you can say that gain
[16:52:32] <tktiddle> aaaarrrrgggghhh!!!! whats that ui library from twitter called again?

[16:53:33] <jdevel> your wedding?

[16:53:46] <ajpiano> gf's cousin...

[16:54:02] <ajpiano> wat

[16:54:20] <ajpiano> the party is canceled/postponed...not the marriage
[16:54:27] <jdevel> lol
[16:54:51] <jdevel> I had all that at the same time
[16:55:04] <ajpiano> because of a hurricane??
[16:55:12] <jdevel> no no
[16:55:38] <jdevel> just was all the same event, so if there was a cane then probably would have pushed the marriage back too

[18:07:58] <camcorder> hi
[18:08:07] <camcorder> I want to set click function for two jquery objects
[18:08:45] <camcorder> like $('.obj1').click (function () { x; }); and $('.ojb2').click(function () { y; });
[18:09:12] <camcorder> can I use something like $(array('.obj1', '.obj2')).click(function() { x; }); ?
[18:09:45] <ajpiano> camcorder: $foo.add($bar).click(fn);
[18:10:06] <sam350> what is $foo
[18:10:14] <sam350> in ure example
[18:10:44] <ajpiano> a jquery object
[18:10:47] <camcorder> sam350, I don't have any foo
[18:10:57] <ajpiano> ?add
[18:10:57] <bot-t> .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[18:10:58] <ajpiano> is the answer
[18:11:00] <sam350> ajpiano, yah I assumed that much
[18:11:10] <camcorder> sam350, but I guess it's $('.obj1').add('.obj2').click()
[18:11:19] <camcorder> right?
[18:11:24] <SIDU> ajpiano: http://jsfiddle.net/xs2Pe/2/
[18:11:39] <camcorder> or $('.ojb1').add($('.obj2')) ?
[18:11:39] <sam350> are you wanting to run the same function on click of both of them
[18:11:40] <SIDU> ajpiano: when i comment out css #menu, it works
[18:11:46] <camcorder> sam350, yes
[18:11:55] <sam350> thought so, so I was going to advise...
[18:12:00] <ajpiano> camcorder: read the docs, you can do either
[18:12:11] <camcorder> ajpiano, thanks
[18:12:24] <sam350> make your code be a real function- function myfunc(){ //code here }
[18:12:33] <sam350> then do a separate bind for both element click
[18:12:38] <sam350> and pass the name of the function to both
[18:12:49] <sam350> instead of the anonomous function which is commonly used
[18:12:56] <sam350> that is clean solution
[18:13:07] <SIDU> ajpiano: no worries. i m doing other way then.
[18:14:20] <sam350> and I would take it further by giving them a class and binding to that class
[18:19:05] <Z3R0> Hello Everyone
[18:44:36] <struys> hey what do people of this: $this = $(this)
[18:44:46] <struys> for jquery stuff
[18:44:50] <struys> (not saying i like it)
[18:50:14] <ColKurtz> um
[18:50:21] <struys> um?
[18:50:27] <ColKurtz> "this" references a certain context you're in
[18:50:36] <struys> sry bad example
[18:50:39] <ColKurtz> i don't think you could define it as a sort of global variable
[18:51:01] <ColKurtz> You mean like $nav = $('#nav'); ?
[18:51:10] <struys> i mean $x = $('#x'), x= document.getelementbyid('#x')
[18:51:30] <struys> just like using $ for specifying type
[18:51:43] <ColKurtz> it's an unofficial convention for signifying that the variable references jQuery as well
[18:51:43] <struys> don't get my wrong i hate strSomething and iSomething
[18:51:54] <ColKurtz> instead of just the DOM element
[18:52:04] <ColKurtz> i worded that kind of wrong/weird but you get what i mean?
[18:52:23] <struys> yea everything within me say "don't do it"
[18:52:27] <struys> but it's dam useful

[19:22:23] <bluebie> gataraid: You can't - the session variable is on the server only. You could use an ajax request to ask your server script for the value of the variable, or include it in the html somewhere, or use a cookie instead, which javascript (and the user) can read
[19:22:59] <gataraid> bluebie: how would I use a cookie sir?
[19:23:12] <gataraid> but ajax is what I was trying to accomplish
[19:23:23] <gataraid> I know it is a server side include
[19:23:23] <Z3R0> ya gataraid, just use a post with a function(data) return
[19:23:48] <gataraid> on change?
[19:24:06] <Z3R0> oh (when you need it) ?
[19:24:09] <gataraid> at the moment I'm also using an onchange to direct to a URL
[19:24:22] <gataraid> well $.change
[19:24:44] <gataraid> is it possible to set the session variable or make the post before the URL direct
[19:24:47] <bluebie> You just set a cookie on your programming language of choice (google it or read it's docs) then read it in javascript using something like this: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie
[19:24:57] <Z3R0> ya why not?
[19:25:06] <gataraid> I didn't know, just asking
[19:25:10] <Z3R0> put the redirect in the callback function of the post
[19:25:27] <gataraid> ah
[19:25:36] <Z3R0> $.post('page.php',function(data) { // data = returned stuff; // do your redirect });
[19:26:08] <Z3R0> heck if you want, you could just redirect all your session data and pass it back as array lol
[19:26:18] <gataraid> data = 'value=','value1' ;
[19:26:19] <gataraid> ?
[19:26:28] <Z3R0> data[index]
[19:26:33] <gataraid> and that would set a $_POST to value=value1 ?
[19:26:40] <Z3R0> oh
[19:26:48] <gataraid> $_POST['value'] would be value1 ?
[19:26:50] <gataraid> is that right?
[19:27:05] <Z3R0> 'page.php', { value:1, value:2 }, function(data) { // stuff });
[19:27:34] <gataraid> $_POST['value'] would then be 1 or 2 ?
[19:27:38] <Z3R0> well
[19:27:43] <gataraid> that right?
[19:27:44] <Z3R0> was just showing you, value can be anything
[19:28:01] <gataraid> Well I mean how would I set the POST variable to a session then
[19:28:08] <Z3R0> ah once it comes in then
[19:28:10] <Z3R0> $_SESSION[
[19:28:13] <gataraid> or actually set it with the $.post
[19:28:32] <Z3R0> on page.php $_SESSION['index'] = $_POST['index'];
[19:28:55] <Z3R0> or if you're tryiing to get the session var TO js, then return $_SESSION['value'] and in the function data['value'] = that var
[19:29:08] <Z3R0> sorry (echo)
[19:30:48] <gataraid> well how would the post be setup to return the $_POST['value'] ?  $.post('session.php',function(data) { } );
[19:31:40] <gataraid> function(data) { 'value=','1'};
[19:32:03] <gataraid> $_POST['value'] would return 1 ?
[19:32:09] <Z3R0> do you want to return FROM php TO js ?
[19:32:21] <gataraid> really js to php
[19:32:26] <gataraid> once I set the session
[19:32:33] <gataraid> I can just include it right and it be set sitewide
[19:32:33] <Z3R0> so you want to send from js to store into session ?
[19:32:34] <gataraid> right?
[19:32:40] <gataraid> yes
[19:32:47] <gataraid> sent from js on an action, like change or click
[19:32:57] <gataraid> to set a session variable according to a value=""
[19:33:10] <gataraid> once that session is set, I can call which header image would be output
[19:33:13] <gataraid> or shown
[19:33:43] <gataraid> I'm using sessions because I didn't know or could think of anything else to use
[19:33:46] <gataraid> or how to accomplish this
[19:34:03] <issackelly> what's the best way to trigger a jquery-ui event, like 'drop'.  $("#element").trigger('drop') doesn't fire my bound event
[19:34:06] <gataraid> I must have did it yesterday but I couldn't trace it back to what worked successfully and I ended up losing my work
[19:34:11] <Z3R0> $.post('session.php', { item_string: "my value", item_integer: 123 }, function() { // do redirect }); // on session.php <?php $_SESSION['item_string'] = $_POST['item_string']; $_SESSION['item_integer'] = $_POST['item_integer']; ?>
[19:34:33] <gataraid> I wasn't sure if $.ajax worked or the $.post worked I used because when I var_dump($_SESSION); it showed but I'd changed code since then
[19:34:39] <gataraid> and I wasn't able to find which one set it
[19:34:41] <Z3R0> either or works
[19:34:46] <Z3R0> ajax just accepts a 'post' tag
[19:34:56] <Z3R0> where as $.post is just post
[19:35:28] <Z3R0> issackelly: perhaps bind?
[19:35:53] <issackelly> Z3R0: I need the opposite of bind, I need to trigger that it happened (I think, I'll re-read)
[19:36:18] <Z3R0> http://jqueryui.com/demos/droppable/
[19:36:25] <Z3R0> that looks to be what you want I think
[19:36:38] <Z3R0> it has a callback function after the drop event occurs
[19:45:00] <DofLeFou> how can accomplish this? https://gist.github.com/656e54c5b174513f7337
[19:45:32] <DofLeFou> on my return I m trying to set the value of ID
[19:46:06] <DofLeFou> ID is in my oData … but i can't  figure out how to access it from my helper
[19:46:15] <Z3R0> id = "' + oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId + '"
[19:46:18] <Z3R0> ?
[19:49:45] <DofLeFou> ZERO: not doing it
[19:50:39] <DofLeFou> it renders like this
[19:50:39] <Z3R0> does console.log() display the value at all ?
[19:50:44] <DofLeFou> yes
[19:51:21] <Z3R0> wait
[19:51:31] <Z3R0> wouldn't it just be id = oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId
[19:52:00] <DofLeFou> https://gist.github.com/1174900
[19:52:25] <DofLeFou> well doing that … i m getting oObj is not defined
[19:53:34] <Z3R0> hmmm...
[19:53:37] <rocktop> hello can some one give me some examples about ajax effects after I submit a form ?
[19:54:14] <DofLeFou> but console.log(oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId) .. print the id just fine
[19:55:38] <butterfly> Can I induce jquery function from actionscript?
[19:56:33] <Z3R0> id = "' + [oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId] + '" ?
[19:57:05] <Z3R0> @rocktop what kinda effects?
[19:58:20] <butterfly> i must change css background-color from flash/action script
[20:01:47] <Rotham> hey.. I am trying to get a html page with jquery.get , and append a portion of it to the current document, but its not working.. im not sure exactly whats going wrong, but firebug shows the child elements are appended, but all of the html children are null/inactive.. the text shows up in the browser window, but there is no sign of the actual elements.. any ideas
[20:02:17] <Z3R0> Rotham: please post your demo @ jsfiddle.net with the proper JS Query version in the drop down
[20:03:49] <DofLeFou> Z3RO: it is still the same
[20:03:57] <DofLeFou> not grabbing it
[20:05:24] <Z3R0> hmmmm...
[20:05:41] <Z3R0> so console.log(oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId); // evals to the id you want
[20:05:47] <Z3R0> but when putting it as id, it evals as a string name?
[20:05:59] <DofLeFou> yes
[20:06:28] <Z3R0> what kinda id's are you using exactly ?
[20:06:37] <DofLeFou> int
[20:06:46] <DofLeFou> int32
[20:06:49] <Z3R0> ya...
[20:07:03] <Z3R0> guess that shouldn't matter because it's being parsed to a string anyways
[20:07:20] <Z3R0> (or at least should be)
[20:08:48] <DofLeFou> looks like … how to access obj from in my helper function is ma issue
[20:09:44] <DofLeFou> and all it does is create the following https://gist.github.com/1174900
[20:10:24] <DofLeFou> ref="/CollectorCode/Edit/'%20%2b%20oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId%20%2b%20'"
[20:10:32] <Z3R0> what happens if you just do id="oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId" ?
[20:10:40] <DofLeFou> href="/CollectorCode/Edit/'%20%2b%20oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId%20%2b%20'"
[20:10:44] <Z3R0> I mean, I know it will probably spit it out as a string lol
[20:10:51] <DofLeFou> yes
[20:10:52] <Z3R0> but it shouldn't give you the %20's and %2b
[20:10:58] <Z3R0> if you remove the ' + + '
[20:13:12] <DofLeFou> yep https://gist.github.com/1174900
[20:13:27] <DofLeFou> href="/CollectorCode/Edit/%5BoObj.aData.CollectorCodeId%5D"
[20:13:54] <Z3R0> why did it wrap it in [ ] tags?
[20:14:13] <Z3R0> %5B / %5D is [ ]
[20:14:15] <DofLeFou> using new { id = "[oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId]" }
[20:14:21] <Z3R0> ah
[20:15:47] <DofLeFou> if i remove the []  href="/CollectorCode/Edit/oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId"
[20:16:10] <Z3R0> ya that's what I figured it would say... hmmmm it obviously won't eval inside the " "
[20:16:25] <Z3R0> but if you remove it form the " " it doesn't eval either ?
[20:16:32] <DofLeFou> if if i try new { id = oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId }
[20:16:33] <Z3R0> " ' + oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId + ' " ?
[20:16:47] <DofLeFou> obj is being yield as undefined
[20:16:55] <Z3R0> why not just set it to something ?
[20:17:02] <Z3R0> var myID = oObj.aData.CollectorCodeId;
[20:17:04] <Z3R0> id = myID
[20:18:14] <DofLeFou> id = myID .. ---> i m getting an error
[20:18:28] <DofLeFou> myID is undefined
[20:18:32] <Z3R0> probably still need to wrap the tags
[20:18:39] <Z3R0> id = " ' + myID + ' "
[20:18:59] <Z3R0> that's trippy lol
[20:19:42] <DofLeFou> The name 'myId' does not exist in the current context
[20:20:01] <DofLeFou> to be specific on the eerror
[20:20:40] <Z3R0> ok well that's about all I know, damn sorry dude
[20:21:06] <DofLeFou> Z3R0: thank you brother
[20:21:30] <Z3R0> surprised not many others are around, if darcy were here you would have an answer 1st try lol
[20:21:45] <Finity> djQuery: hey dude, just wanted to give you an FYI, that I haven't forgotten about your request to see how I get my MCPD.  So far, I've learned C# and .NET, and I'm working on the, you know, important stuff (ASP.NET, WCF, ADO.NET)
[20:21:55] <Finity> just wanted you know ^_^
[20:22:18] <djQuery> Finity: MVC
[20:22:34] <DofLeFou> do u know a way i could build that … without using the helper
[20:22:41] <Finity> djQuery: as yes, of course
[20:22:49] <Z3R0> DofLeFou: I don't know what you're building honestly... but it looks cool
[20:23:39] <Finity> djQuery: learning classic ASP.NET model for now, though, then I'll transition into MVC.  I come from a django background, so I doubt there will be much change in mindset between the two
[20:23:41] <DofLeFou> z3R0: A billing system … with C#, MVC# and lost query n ajax
[20:23:46] <Finity> couple more months, though
[20:23:50] <Finity> and I'll return :)
[20:23:58] <djQuery> Finity: been doing classic for years myself
[20:24:49] <Z3R0> maybe djQuery  can help you? lol he's got the name query after all
[20:25:08] <DofLeFou> Z3RO: i ran into an issue where .. IE8 was tripping with my DataTable plugin ..
[20:25:23] <DofLeFou> I have about 20,000 records
[20:25:42] <DofLeFou> while FF and Chrome work fine
[20:25:49] <djQuery> DofLeFou: paging?
[20:25:50] <DofLeFou> IE8 went badaboum
[20:26:05] <Z3R0> djQuery: this https://gist.github.com/656e54c5b174513f7337
[20:26:07] <djQuery> ie sucks at rendering tables
[20:26:28] <DofLeFou> so I re implement my stuff .. and do all the processing at the client side
[20:26:38] <DofLeFou> and IE8 is much hapier
[20:26:44] <Z3R0> lol
[20:27:07] <Z3R0> you know I honestly hate IE, but unfortunately almost EVERY business uses it
[20:27:16] <DofLeFou> now one little thing to figure out how to solve this https://gist.github.com/656e54c5b174513f7337
[20:27:34] <djQuery> Z3R0: what code is that asp.net mvc?
[20:27:36] <Z3R0> I'm curious as to the answe lol
[20:27:48] <Z3R0> iono as DofLeFou
[20:28:01] <DofLeFou> Yes, MVC3, with razor
[20:28:21] <Z3R0> lol no wonder + is probably not the right append operator...
[20:28:36] <djQuery> think .Create takes a 2nd parameter for the attributes of the link
[20:30:32] <DofLeFou> djQuery: @MvcHtmlString.Create
[20:30:40] <djQuery> DofLeFou: Z3R0: kinda like this @Html.PageLinks(Model.PagingInfo, x => Url.Action("List", new { page = x, category = Model.CurrentCategory }))
[20:31:06] <DofLeFou> My view is now strongly type to a VIew
[20:31:24] <DofLeFou> so that in there .. category = Model.CurrentCategory
[20:31:28] <DofLeFou> will not work
[20:31:29] <djQuery> dangit wrong copy
[20:31:54] <DofLeFou> i m filling my Table … from an Ajax request
[20:32:14] <djQuery> DofLeFou: z3ro: @Html.RouteLink(link, new { Controller = "Product", action = "List", category = link, page = 1 },     new { @class = link == ViewBag.SelectedCategory ? "selected" : null })
[20:32:27] <djQuery> but your tring to do it as a helper method?
[20:32:35] <DofLeFou> yes
[20:32:58] <Z3R0> see I have no idea wtf a "helper method" is lol
[20:33:21] <djQuery> Z3R0: different name for re-usable
[20:33:36] <Z3R0> ah
[20:33:52] <djQuery> DofLeFou: how many of these buttons are there going to be on the page?
[20:34:00] <DofLeFou> https://gist.github.com/656e54c5b174513f7337
[20:34:23] <DofLeFou> the whole picture …. it is now on the page ….
[20:34:37] <DofLeFou> but that is being render from my script
[20:34:53] <DofLeFou> while the button render just fine
[20:36:04] <djQuery> never used datatable before. used jqgrid quite a bit
[20:36:24] <jcDesigns> hello all
[20:36:39] <DofLeFou> the table and the button … are rendered just fine
[20:36:57] <DofLeFou> passing that id … is the issue
[20:37:31] <jcDesigns> can someone help with something I NEED to understand? It's driving me nuts
[20:37:55] <Z3R0> can't help with what we can't see ;)
[20:38:10] <Z3R0> although I probably won't be much help anyways
[20:38:11] <jcDesigns> ok, flyout menu with jquery
[20:38:17] <djQuery> DofLeFou: wont it allready be in the htmlimageactionlink?
[20:38:28] <jcDesigns> on the hover, the ul gets this .css({visibility : "visible", display : "none"}).show()
[20:38:34] <Z3R0> oh this again
[20:38:38] <jcDesigns> dammit!
[20:38:45] <jcDesigns> i didn't have time earlier
[20:38:45] <Z3R0> what's wrong with it ?
[20:38:49] <jcDesigns> nothing
[20:38:53] <Z3R0> I know you said it displays, hides and then shows again
[20:38:55] <jcDesigns> i want to know the why
[20:39:12] <DofLeFou> djQuery: i need to send it to the controller as follow … new { id = this.myId }
[20:39:12] <djQuery> how can you hove it if its not allreay shown?
[20:39:36] <jcDesigns> you hover on the li to display the nested ul
[20:39:40] <DofLeFou> or new { id = //However i can access obj }
[20:40:02] <Z3R0> ah
[20:40:10] <Z3R0> visibility hides (but does not remove)
[20:40:12] <Z3R0> display (removes)
[20:40:17] <Z3R0> http://www.vanseodesign.com/blog/demo/display-visibility.html#
[20:40:18] <jcDesigns> i understand that .show() needs the display set in order for it to work
[20:40:52] <jcDesigns> yes, i know the difference between the two CSS wise
[20:40:52] <DofLeFou> jcDesigns: render it .. and on ready hide it
[20:41:15] <jcDesigns> but why make it visible only to remove it
[20:41:29] <Z3R0> wouldn't it be rendered even if you display: none; it?
[20:41:40] <DofLeFou> you can't hide something that does exist
[20:42:09] <howardgrigg> hey guys, some help please - i'm keen to update some html on the fly as a person is typing into a text field but I'm not sure of the right words to explain it - easy to explain with an image http://cl.ly/2Y102s383Y1G3d3F3M1s
[20:43:09] <Z3R0> I think you want .keyPress()
[20:43:21] <Z3R0> howardgrigg: ^
[20:43:53] <jcDesigns> wait...what does that mean Dof? did you mean 'does not'
[20:44:25] <howardgrigg> Z3R0: thanks - ill look into it
[20:44:28] <djQuery> can you paste the html of the imagelink is now displayed?
[20:48:00] <jcDesigns> does it have something to do with jquery and visibility detection? visibility gives it a width and height so jquery says ah, its visible, then display: none hides it, which comes after the fact, and then show sets it to block?
[20:48:09] <djQuery> howardgrigg: or see ?keyup
[20:48:09] <bot-t> howardgrigg, .keyup(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keyup" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keyup/
[20:50:33] <jcDesigns> where's Irish when you need him...and are you just on all day z3r0? i asked that like 8 hours ago
[20:51:09] <ajpiano> howardgrigg: http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/ZPLbA/
[20:51:28] <ajpiano> assuming you had the images, that would work
[20:51:36] <Z3R0> howardgrigg: you around ?
[20:51:43] <howardgrigg> woah
[20:51:44] <Z3R0> oh dammit ajpiano
[20:51:51] <howardgrigg> thats awesome ajpiano
[20:52:08] <ajpiano> rarely is a picture worth 1000 words
[20:52:10] <howardgrigg> saved me heaps of messing around
[20:52:13] <Z3R0> Spent all this time researching trying to help him with a basic understanding http://jsfiddle.net/WBK7p/6/ // and you go through all that
[20:52:21] <howardgrigg> haha
[20:52:34] <ajpiano> hehe :)
[20:52:44] <ajpiano> Z3R0: it's good to see you helpin out though all the same :)
[20:52:53] <howardgrigg> don't worry Z3R0 you still helped me get my head around it
[20:52:56] <Z3R0> well, best to get advice from the pro's
[20:53:10] <Z3R0> ya, mine's basic, then you move toward w/e the heck ajpiano did
[20:53:25] <Z3R0> and mine used javascript inside jquery I didn't know how to conver the char else wise
[20:53:42] <ajpiano> Z3R0: you don't convert the char, you just get the value of the input
[20:53:55] <Z3R0> well yea, I just didn't want to list a whole bunch of numbers
[20:54:01] <ajpiano> ah
[20:54:20] <Z3R0> but in essence, you could just create your files to use <charcode>.jpg
[20:54:21] <Z3R0> or w/e
[20:55:05] <Z3R0> then you really have fun, when you have several different variations of each letter, and put it through a random mixer
[20:58:31] <Z3R0> how do you pass a function an unknown amount of args/
[20:59:04] <Z3R0> should I just encapsulate it into an array?
[20:59:41] <ajpiano> you can iterate over the function arguments Z3R0 http://msmvps.com/blogs/luisabreu/archive/2009/09/14/iterating-through-the-arguments-object.aspx
[21:02:05] <howardgrigg> ajpiano & Z3R0: if you were interested in what I'm going to use it for I'm just setting up a site to sell bin numbers and this way they can enter their street address and it will show what it will look like on the bin http://dcbc.co.nz/binnumbers/index.html
[21:02:32] <howardgrigg> haven't setup the order system yet but thanks for your help :)
[21:03:08] <ajpiano> ah, good old fashioned kiwi made bin numbers
[21:04:38] <howardgrigg> hah yea :)
[21:04:49] <Z3R0> lol nice
[21:09:12] <DofLeFou> Z3RO: u still there
[21:11:49] <thebignoise> is there a way for indexOf to return the pos of the end of the string
[21:12:10] <thebignoise> string.indexOf('hey') returns 6
[21:12:14] <thebignoise> i want 8
[21:19:12] <Z3R0> ya
[21:19:42] <Z3R0> if I want to populate a table from a $.post() response would I have to create my own html tags in jquery or is there some other way to do it ?
[21:20:04] <abjorn> Hm, that's weird, modernizr suddenly isn't setting classes on my html element anymore
[21:22:23] <DofLeFou> Z3R0: i got it
[21:22:30] <Z3R0> o.o
[21:22:58] <DofLeFou> https://gist.github.com/1174970
[21:23:10] <DofLeFou> well some by hand
[21:25:20] <Z3R0> lol got rid of the functions I see
[21:29:37] <DofLeFou> yep .. build that … it seems to be working
[21:32:16] <osmosis> can someone help me take this code, http://jsfiddle.net/mDUyb/ , and get it to use the live data from https://mtgox.com/api/0/data/ticker.php
[21:37:03] <Clinteger> what would be fastest? $('selector[id!=exclude]') or $('selector:not(#exclude)') or $('selector').not('#exclude')?
[21:37:22] <Clinteger> i suspect that the first would be fastest but i could be totally wrong, hence my asking ;)
[21:46:32] <Clinteger> well i just did some testing and the one i suspected would be the fastest was actually over 3 times slower
[22:03:39] <min|dvir|us> On what can I use $.data()?
[22:03:39] <bot-t> (73 hours 9 mins ago) <danheberden> tell min|dvir|us https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L440
[22:07:59] <Z3R0> @min|dvir|us: any html element ?
[22:10:44] <min|dvir|us> Z3R0: no.
[22:33:09] <Eviltwin> I have an array of jQuery objects
[22:33:15] <Eviltwin> And I'd like to merge them into one jQuery object
[22:33:16] <Eviltwin> Any ideas?
[22:33:43] <Eviltwin> Some jQuery function I can call?
[22:40:50] <jrockjiggz> Hi, is it possible to fragment a page using $.ajax ?
[22:41:19] <jrockjiggz> instead of .load(url + ' #fragment'), use $.ajax
[22:42:16] <jrockjiggz> oh nm i googled it.
[22:43:47] <jrockjiggz> does anyone know the regex to get the last ' #string' from a url?
[22:44:06] <Eviltwin> What?
[22:44:15] <misterm> jrockjiggz: where is the url coming from?
[22:44:26] <jrockjiggz> e.g. 'index.php #someFragment'
[22:44:36] <jrockjiggz> regex to get '#someFragment'
[22:45:59] <jrockjiggz> i could split at the space
[22:47:13] <kborchers> jrockjiggz: no regex necessary ... var str = "someurl.com#fragment"; var fragment = str.substr(str.lastIndexOf("#"));
[22:48:57] <Eviltwin> URLs don't have spaces in them...
[22:49:07] <jrockjiggz> Eviltwin its from jQuery api docs
[22:49:14] <Eviltwin> Then it's not a URL
[22:49:20] <jrockjiggz> no its a fragment
[22:49:34] <jrockjiggz> see load()
[22:50:07] <Eviltwin> I know what load does
[22:50:23] <Eviltwin> But it's important to understand that it's not just a URL
[22:51:18] <jrockjiggz> the space is used within the application and is not used as a url if thats what you mean
[22:52:28] <Eviltwin> "does anyone know the regex to get the last ' #string' from a url?"
[22:53:08] <Eviltwin> It sounds like you're trying to duplicate the functionality of .load
[22:53:08] <Eviltwin> Why?
[22:55:45] <jrockjiggz> Eviltwin - yes i am duplicating load.  because i want to use the ajax jqxhr object
[22:56:29] <Eviltwin> That gets passed to the complete function
[22:57:51] <jrockjiggz> the point is at any time i can have more than 1 ajax request, the point is to cancel an ajax request if need be
[22:59:05] <jrockjiggz> kborchers example isn't perfect :( http://jsfiddle.net/dz9tL/1/
[23:00:02] <Eviltwin> Here's how jQuery does it: http://pastebin.com/a0aSH5nz
[23:02:40] <jrockjiggz> Eviltwin: works pefectly  - thank you http://jsfiddle.net/dz9tL/3/
[23:03:30] <Eviltwin> You'll probably want to remove the fragment from the $.ajax call
[23:03:52] <jrockjiggz> yes jquery rewrites it without
[23:05:49] <jrockjiggz> works good thanks again
[23:12:06] <TheEmpath2> haven't been here in a while!
[23:12:15] <Jakey> why should yolu
[23:12:24] <TheEmpath2> they put a gun to my head .____.
[23:12:53] <TheEmpath2> so im curious about having a way to spawn multiple instances of a jqueryUI Dialog
[23:13:15] <TheEmpath2> how doth one do it?
[23:20:43] <kurtis> Hey guys, any ideas on why a .each click event for checkboxes would run twice for each click?
[23:21:05] <kurtis> For the value of the checkbox, one comes up with the correct value and another is "undefined"
[23:28:24] <min|dvir|us> Any way to set an event's polling timer?
[23:39:01] <kurtis> I don't understand at all what's going on with this code. I have several checkboxes and they have a common class. I used that class as a selector which runs through an anonymous function. But whenever I click on other elements in the table, they still call that anonymous function ? what's going on?
[23:39:25] <kurtis> I'm not using any <label> tags, btw
[23:55:34] <ruby_on_tails> http://jsfiddle.net/5CfXt/ can anyone suggest how i can optimize this js ? its very slow working with table with 1000 entries
[23:58:32] <manuel_> so it's always td.ledger_type?
[23:58:40] <manuel_> you can reuse a fair share of selectors
[23:59:19] <manuel_> what is the structure of the table?
