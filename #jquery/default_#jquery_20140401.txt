[00:01:53] <beachandbytes> Besan, I would just update the data instead of the entire html
[00:02:42] <Besan> i tried but function loadPage() doesn't update the globalVar . . .
[00:03:00] <jcool> There are 3 dropdowns with me. all working perfect with jquery. there is a small issue. if you select country- then province , then you get list of cities in 3rd drop down. but now when I change my country, the cities remain same as they were in last selection. I need to reset cities so that they get filled only when province is selected.
[00:04:58] <Besan> beachandbytes, are you able to modify my jsbin so i can see it ?
[00:05:10] <Besan> i'm new to jsbin
[00:05:12] <Besan> :)
[00:05:17] <beachandbytes> ya one second
[00:05:21] <beachandbytes> I'll use a model binder
[00:05:21] <Besan> cool
[00:32:52] <talin> hello. i use fadeIn to display some fields. is there an effect that lasts a little longer, such that it can remind a user to fill out that field most of the time?
[00:33:04] <talin> it's not a required field, but most of the time it should be filled out
[00:35:20] <Cork> talin: you can set the amount of animation time it should use
[00:36:07] <talin> hmm, that's a good idea
[00:36:14] <talin> if i make it extremely slow, that should be pretty visible
[00:36:34] <Cork> talin: or you can chain them to make it blink or...
[00:37:31] <talin> Cork: that's even better
[00:37:58] <ph1> Guys I'm running this to update a dropdown box to empty it first and then put a value in it but the value isn't displaying in the dropdown...-         destcity.empty();
[00:37:59] <ph1>         destcity.val("Select province first");
[00:38:43] <Cork> ph1: val sets what option should be selected
[00:38:45] <Cork> it doesn't add them
[00:39:02] <Cork> append('<option value="">display text</option>')
[00:39:18] <ph1> ah ok thanks Cork!
[00:40:46] <ph1> Cork, umm sorry what would the syntax be destcity.append('<option value="">display text</option>')
[00:40:53] <ph1> like that?
[00:40:56] <Cork> yes
[00:41:04] <ph1> nice one cheers :D
[00:43:17] <Grundell> Hello
[00:43:40] <Grundell> I have sort of a problem, i get some wierd slideeffect on my toggle
[00:44:20] <Grundell> When i toggle it it goes down 320 px but when i toggle it again it goes up 220px... don't really know why
[00:44:31] <Grundell> So i thought if someone could have a look at it :)?
[00:44:40] <Cork> Grundell: min-height?
[00:45:03] <Grundell> Cork: Nope fixed height.
[00:45:23] <Cork> might be the inner element is overflowing the parent then
[00:46:38] <Grundell> Cork: if you look at http://dressupinyou.se/ in a browser window between 480px and 760px width you'll see a green button just benith the red banner where it says "f√• offert"
[00:46:55] <Grundell> Cork don't think it is...
[00:47:52] <Cork> uh
[00:48:07] <Cork> your sidbar breaks kinda badly when the window is narrow
[00:48:20] <Grundell> you need to reload
[00:48:55] <Grundell> It is made for only mobile view and there it's supposed to reload when you flip the screen
[00:49:25] <Cork> Grundell: ya, but 767px width is broken
[00:49:52] <Cork> sorry 757
[00:50:27] <Grundell> I see well that's the next thing to fix
[00:50:52] <Grundell> Now i need to figure out how to fix the problem with the toggle
[00:51:16] <Cork> ok i see it now
[00:51:44] <Cork> btw "TypeError: $(...).find(...).addClass(...).end(...).superfish is not a function"
[00:52:08] <Grundell> i know
[00:52:32] <Grundell> Old recidue
[00:53:28] <Cork> Grundell: you off set the element by margin-top
[00:53:31] <Cork> but you animate top
[00:53:42] <Grundell> Yes
[00:53:45] <Cork> if you animate margin-top instead it should work
[00:54:35] <Cork> hmm actually no
[00:54:48] <Cork> you need to animate to -height of element
[00:54:53] <Grundell> Nope that breaks the whole thing :)
[00:54:54] <Cork> not to -200
[00:55:13] <Cork> i meant top: -$(this).height()
[00:55:39] <Cork> the element is 240px high
[00:55:53] <Cork> so if you animate to -200px you will have 200px sticking out
[00:56:21] <Grundell> okay...
[00:56:35] <ph1> Cork, thanks for that - that worked perfectly and beachandbytes - thanks for your code earlier, it's all working a treat now :)
[00:56:58] <beachandbytes> awesome
[00:57:09] <beachandbytes> Besan, still messing with yours
[00:57:12] <beachandbytes> jsbin is a bitch sometimes
[00:57:22] <Besan> :)
[00:57:30] <ph1> yeah it's great when it all comes together :D
[00:57:33] <Besan> As i said, i'm new to it
[00:58:18] <Grundell> Cork - the thing is that it goes up the right amount i want it to but for some reason it goes down 300px + Which i really cant see why it does ...
[00:58:18] <Besan> beachandbytes, for how long you'll be online ?
[00:58:41] <Besan> I got to run, be back in 15 mins :(
[00:58:47] <Cork> Grundell: well you math is off
[00:58:49] <Cork> like i said
[00:59:17] <gingitsune> Can anyone please help me figure out why ckeditor is not saving color and background color properties.
[00:59:41] <Cork> Grundell: the element need to start at -element height
[00:59:51] <Cork> animate down to zero
[00:59:57] <Cork> and then back to -element height
[01:00:02] <gingitsune> After i save it comes up as ..style="\"collor...\\\\"\"
[01:00:04] <gingitsune> and so on
[01:00:16] <gingitsune> Im using the color button widget
[01:00:22] <Cork> Grundell: so if you really need the -200px margin you would have to start from -40px and go to 440px
[01:00:27] <gingitsune> and inline editing mode editing a div
[01:00:34] <Cork> and then back to -40px
[01:00:45] <Grundell> ahh..
[01:00:53] <Grundell> So how do i flip it around ... ?
[01:01:16] <Cork> Grundell: i would start by removing the -200px !important
[01:01:38] <Cork> set the margin-top to 0
[01:01:51] <Cork> and the top value of the element to -element height
[01:01:59] <Cork> and when you show it animate to 0
[01:02:06] <Cork> and then back to -element height
[01:04:20] <Grundell> Sorry since im pretty novice when it comes to jQuery, how do i set the top value of element ?
[01:04:22] <dawkirst> Trying to understand something: is it okay to return promises for synchronous functions?
[01:05:23] <Cork> Grundell: $(function() { var elm = $('selector'); elm.css('top', -elm.height()); });
[01:05:40] <Cork> btw you might want to use outerHeight instead of height()
[01:05:48] <Cork> so you include borders and the like
[01:10:35] <Grundell> Cork - okay (sorry got a phonecall... )
[01:13:01] <Grundell> Cork - So last how do i animate it back to element height?
[01:16:30] <frank_o> How do I enable scrolling in jQuery Mobile's panel using `overflow: auto`? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/4Q8yb/ (using https://github.com/filamentgroup/Overthrow)
[01:21:58] <Cork> Grundell: elmObj.animate({ top: -elmObj.height() }, 'slow')
[01:23:50] <Besan> beachandbytes, i'm back :) Any updates ?
[01:25:14] <Grundell> Crok - Okay... doesn't seam to behave like i want it to...
[01:29:56] <knobo> how can I recover from $(target).attr('src', Icon); if Icon does not exist?
[01:30:56] <beachandbytes> Bescan, ya bringing it over to jsfiddle

[01:34:20] <alexcf> hi guys
[01:34:41] <alexcf> im using a template, where it seems they've integrated the flot graph stuff within it
[01:34:50] <alexcf> the problem i've got is being able to manipulate that
[01:35:24] <alexcf> http://pastebin.com/2gVyeuxC
[01:35:40] <alexcf> on line 56 they initCharts, then go through the whole thing
[01:35:54] <alexcf> when i try and load a function using DOM elsewhere it fails
[01:40:21] <Kamuela> Hey guys, good early morning-ish.
[01:41:10] <Kamuela> I'm trying to write a selector that catches a submit event from a form that uses enter and no button, e.g. a comments field. I'm wondering how I would bind to this event?
[01:41:41] <Cork> Kamuela: they most likely isn't using a sumbit event at all
[01:41:55] <Cork> as ie doesn't listen for enter in a form unless it has a button
[01:42:20] <Cork> but if it doesn't have ie support it would just have a submit listener on the form
[01:42:35] <Besan> beachandbytes, i'm here again
[01:42:47] <Kamuela> Cork: thank you, very much appreciated
[01:43:00] <beachandbytes> give me a second besan, btc is moving :)
[01:43:30] <Kamuela> so would the form need an ID, like id="thisForm" and then I would use $('#thisForm').submit(postFunction());
[01:43:55] <Kamuela> beachandbytes: In which direction? I've been watching my stock dip daily haha
[01:44:12] <Besan> ok, thanks
[01:44:15] <Besan> :)
[01:44:47] <beachandbytes> Kamuela, just gained 10% in a few minutes
[01:47:16] <Kamuela> beachandbytes: Stupid app name and ugly icon, but most beautiful and useful ios app is "space cash"
[01:49:52] <Besan> Sometime i may run offline but if you get any luck PM me :)
[01:51:50] <frank_o> Kamuela: Do you have a link to this most beautiful and useful iOS app?
[01:52:02] <ocx> morning all
[01:52:10] <beachandbytes> I think the 482-483 call was probably the best
[01:52:14] <beachandbytes> should have stuck with taht
[01:52:32] <ocx> $("#addTagField").val()   gets the value of the radiobox how can i get the name of the radiobox in jquery? .name() ?
[01:53:00] <Cork> ocx: .attr('name')
[01:53:35] <ocx> thanks Cork btw i fixed the tag thing yesterday it turned out it has a specific datastrcture
[01:53:55] <ocx> thank you for always helping this channel really your help is much appreciated
[01:54:53] <Kamuela> frank_o: "Space Cash" it's for Bitcoin value
[01:55:22] <Kamuela> Cork: How should I be handling this event if I want it to trigger an ajax call?
[01:55:47] <Cork> Kamuela: event.preventDefault() if nothing else already does that
[01:55:55] <Cork> Kamuela: after that you can just do the ajax call
[01:56:19] <Kamuela> Cork: well, I mean assuming the .submit() event isn't binding
[01:56:39] <Cork> Kamuela: might be they do return false;
[01:56:42] <Cork> and then you can't bind it
[01:57:55] <Kamuela> Cork: Ah so I can check in the console right now, $('#postComment').submit() ?
[01:58:22] <Cork> Kamuela: that will fake trigger jquery submit event listeners yes
[01:58:51] <Kamuela> Cork: it returned the whole DOM object. so it's definitely latching on
[01:58:51] <jdo_dk> i have a page with X images. And im trying to find a plugin, which can find "random" image on site and "replace" image with new one, with effect fade in/out.
[01:59:03] <Kamuela> Cork: I guess the debugging I need to do is somewhere else then
[01:59:33] <Cork> jdo_dk: why do you need a plugin
[01:59:40] <Cork> shouldn't be more then 5-6 lines of code
[02:00:09] <jdo_dk> Cork: Don't know. Can you provide me with the 5-6 lines of code then? :D
[02:01:19] <Cork> var images = $('img'), replace = Math.floor(Math.random() * images.length); images.eq(replace).replaceWith('<img src="">'
[02:01:22] <Cork> *);
[02:01:39] <jdo_dk> Where is the fade in / fade out effect ?
[02:02:01] <Cork> that would be the other 3 lines
[02:02:20] <Cork> depending on how you want make the animation
[02:02:26] <Cork> you can either just reuse the old img element
[02:02:50] <Cork> or you want cross fade you would have to be a bit more fiddly
[02:02:58] <Cork> and wrap the img tag with a wrapper
[02:03:07] <Cork> and have the img tags positioned absolute inside it
[02:03:41] <jdo_dk> cross fade yes
[02:04:07] <ocx> it just highlights it the other bracket is seen on the screen, if it is not i am not able to see it
[02:11:11] <Kamuela> I want to do something like $('#postComment').parent().parent().('.selectorWithinParent').append(), what's the real approach?
[02:11:28] <Cork> Kamuela: .find
[02:11:46] <Cork> and if you want to go multiple parents it is often better to use .closest instead of parent
[02:12:18] <Kamuela> so closest will give me the nearest parent matching something
[02:12:26] <Cork> yes
[02:13:14] <Cork> usually you do something like $(this).closest('.some-wrapper').find('.some-sibling').append()
[02:13:33] <Cork> well not sibling, but ... relative? :D
[02:17:34] <Kamuela> Cork: $('#postComment').closest('.commentsContainer').find('.holdComments').find('.commentInner').append('<div>TEST2</div>'); works except I need for it to find the last instance of .commentInner, how would I specify that?
[02:18:00] <Cork> $('#postComment').closest('.commentsContainer').find('.holdComments .commentInner').last().append('<div>TEST2</div>')
[02:21:26] <computer2000> pls help: i dont know if the checkbox is already in the dom and need to bind a change event to it, how can i do that?
[02:21:58] <computer2000> $('.checkbox').on('change', function() {...}); doesnt seem to work
[02:23:41] <Cork> computer2000: try use a delegated event listener
[02:24:25] <Kamuela> Cork: thank you so much, that selector works very well
[02:24:54] <Kamuela> Cork: or I suppose, that jquery function ?
[02:25:08] <computer2000> Cork: how to do that?
[02:27:47] <Cork> ?api on
[02:27:47] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:28:03] <Cork> computer2000: the selector version
[02:28:30] <computer2000> $('.parent').on('change', '.mycheckbox', function() {...}); doesnt seem to work
[02:30:37] <Cork> computer2000: that should work
[02:31:52] <computer2000> Cork: ok works now my mistake. thx
[02:34:58] <Grundell> Is it possible to take a div remove all attributes from it such as <div id="goran" class="gringos colus ditos"> and then add a single id to it ?
[02:37:04] <Cork> Grundell: no
[02:37:12] <Cork> you would have to remove the attributes one by one
[02:37:17] <Cork> or create a completely new element
[02:37:28] <Grundell> Cork: okay, thanks
[02:37:37] <Garfield-fr> you are this solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1870441/remove-all-attributes
[02:38:14] <Garfield-fr> or http://upshots.org/javascript/jquery-remove-attributes
[02:39:28] <Cork> Grundell: but why do you need to do this?
[02:39:51] <Cork> Grundell: it indicates that something in the page structure is wrong if you need to do that
[02:40:59] <Grundell> Cork - Because my "dropdown" position it self wrong since its inside a relative position
[02:41:21] <Cork> Grundell: so fix the css then
[02:41:28] <Cork> that is where it should be solved
[02:42:07] <Grundell> Cork: yeah
[02:42:23] <fabioportieri> o/
[03:07:54] <alexandernst> How can I get the content inside <script> by id?  I tried $('#the_id'), but it doesn't return anything.
[03:08:10] <slax0r> did you try .html()?
[03:08:28] <alexandernst> slax0r: .html() after what selector?
[03:08:46] <alexandernst> $('#the_id') doesn't return anything (as in doesn't match anything)
[03:09:29] <ocx> in the toggle function isnt it supposed to call function1 on first clikc and function2 on second click?
[03:09:52] <slax0r> does <script> have an id?
[03:14:27] <bristleback> hi
[03:15:00] <bristleback> I have a fieldset which contains some input elements that I have to keep outside the form that already exists on that page
[03:15:23] <bristleback> I want to serialize the fieldset in the same way I serialize the form
[03:15:33] <bristleback> the problem is that it doesn't work
[03:15:37] <fabioportieri> why do you need to keep them outside the form?
[03:16:08] <bristleback> it is not relevant for the scope of my question and it doesn't help understanding it better
[03:16:22] <bristleback> but I can explain you if that's what you want
[03:16:35] <bristleback> is a matter of user interaction
[03:16:36] <bristleback> anyway
[03:16:41] <alexandernst> slax0r: turns out it was a bad id (containing '.')
[03:16:54] <bristleback> the thing is that I can't serialize the fieldset
[03:17:00] <fabioportieri> it is relevant because if the elements wouldn't be outside the form you wouldn't have this problem
[03:17:11] <bristleback> :)
[03:17:50] <fabioportieri> bristleback: what about having them inside <form> and just layout them with css, if yours is a presentation requirements
[03:17:50] <bristleback> if it could be inside the form, I would have serilized the form and never asked my question here
[03:18:03] <bristleback> well, that is not possible
[03:18:03] <fabioportieri> bristleback: indeed
[03:18:16] <bristleback> ok
[03:18:19] <bristleback> continuing
[03:18:24] <ocx> in the toggle function isnt it supposed to call function1 on first clikc and function2 on second click?
[03:18:32] <bristleback> how can I serialize the fieldset
[03:18:33] <bristleback> ?
[03:20:17] <bristleback> I have tried to copy the html, crete a new var (eq: var test =$( '<form>' + $("#myfieldset_id").html() + '</form>') and then serialize the obtained variable
[03:20:28] <bristleback> it still doesn't work
[03:20:33] <bristleback> what can I do?
[03:21:10] <fabioportieri> bristleback: http://onwebdev.blogspot.com/2012/03/jquery-serialize-elements-outside-forms.html
[03:22:32] <bristleback> fabioportieri: thanks :)
[03:22:38] <bristleback> any other opinions?
[03:22:43] <fabioportieri> you're welcome
[03:22:57] <fabioportieri> i think the post is pretty exhaustive.. in short, just do it manually
[03:23:42] <bristleback> fabioportieri: don't you think that the reason I ask here is because the only thing that came in my mind was to do it manually?
[03:24:24] <bristleback> fabioportieri: that's your best answer and you also try to defend it?
[03:24:32] <bristleback> fabioportieri: that's not ok
[03:25:00] <nullbytes> Is there something like jQuery Accordion with custom sorting and filtering of headers and a scrollbar that lazy loads the headers when they are scrolled to?
[03:25:10] <fabioportieri> bristleback: chill man, if you want  a plugin to do the job for you just ask it, anyway our job is to program stuff, you know?
[03:25:17] <bristleback> fabioportieri: doing things manually for such a complex task, is prone to errors, a lot of errors
[03:25:30] <ocx> Cork: Is there a way to run two functions similar to this:  $('.myClass').click(     function() {         // First click     },     function() {         // Second click     } );
[03:25:40] <fabioportieri> bristleback: nothing really complex there..
[03:25:50] <bristleback> a plugin?
[03:25:56] <bristleback> are you kiddin?
[03:26:06] <Cork> ocx: no, you would have to keep track of that your self
[03:26:27] <bristleback> there are two functions for that: SERIALIZE() and SERIALIZEARRAY()
[03:26:32] <fabioportieri> bristleback: if you don't want to code it, and don't want a plugin that already does it, what else would you possibly want?
[03:26:41] <bristleback> we reinvent the wheel or what?
[03:27:28] <fabioportieri> nobody is reinventing the wheel here. jquery .serialize() doesn't work for elements outside the form, period, if you still need to do it, just friggin serialize it yourself
[03:27:33] <bristleback> fabioportieri: an idea for an workaround that does the job using what already exists
[03:27:40] <ocx> Cork: for instance i have a checkbox i need to do something when it is checked and something different when unchecked what is the easiest way to do it in jquery
[03:28:03] <Cork> ocx: if($(this).prop('checked')) {}
[03:28:08] <fabioportieri> aniway going to lunch later
[03:28:12] <ocx> if($('#isAgeSelected').attr('checked')) {
[03:28:18] <Cork> no not attr
[03:28:22] <ocx> hmm ok
[03:28:30] <ocx> if($('#isAgeSelected').prop('checked')) {
[03:28:36] <Cork> and in the click handler just use this
[03:28:38] <slax0r> isn't it .is?
[03:28:42] <Cork> no need to run a dom selector
[03:28:53] <ocx> 2 if conditions Cork in the click handlers
[03:28:56] <Cork> slax0r: it is if you want to run sizzle for the check
[03:29:26] <slax0r> Cork: sizzle?
[03:29:51] <Cork> slax0r: .is runs a selector and then if it checks if length > 0
[03:30:05] <Cork> slax0r: prop('checked') checks the dom property of the element
[03:30:09] <Cork> and it is a true/false value
[03:30:13] <gingitsune> is there a way to monitor a dom elements events?
[03:30:23] <slax0r> I see, so .prop should be faster?
[03:30:29] <Cork> slax0r: much
[03:31:02] <bristleback> fabioportieri: you don't know what you're talking about :))))))))
[03:31:27] <bristleback> fabioportieri: here... http://jsfiddle.net/
[03:31:34] <Cork> slax0r: it is several times faster, but the effect of the speed of the page is most likely not noticeable
[03:31:59] <bristleback> open that in firefox and then tell me if serializeArray() works for other elements than form
[03:32:37] <slax0r> Cork: yeah sure, but still, if you have to check a couple of times, it could make a difference
[03:32:44] <Cork> ya
[03:32:47] <bristleback> than google it and tell me if you found an issue regarding the fact that serializeArray() has problems in Chrome and IE9
[03:32:56] <Cork> ans specifically, it is cleaner
[03:32:58] <Cork> *and
[03:33:08] <Cork> slax0r: .is is a bit of a mess
[03:33:26] <Cork> as it makes a selector and checks if the current element is in the selection
[03:33:41] <bristleback> this is the correct link: http://jsfiddle.net/8s2Jy/

[03:34:14] <slax0r> why?
[03:34:56] <Cork> slax0r: cause it's a mess, and they recently made a complete switch of how you configure it
[03:35:05] <Cork> so 90+ of all the info on the net is out of date
[03:35:12] <Cork> and doesn't work at all >_<
[03:35:13] <nullbytes> Is there something like jQuery Accordion with custom sorting and filtering of headers and a scrollbar that lazy loads the headers when they are scrolled to?
[03:35:33] <Cork> been banging my head on this *** for almost a week
[03:42:09] <haggi102> anyone us irc.bondage.com?
[03:42:59] <Grundell> Cork: still there... have a question if you feel like you have time :)?
[03:44:19] <Archer_xda> Grundell: Just ask - there's lots of people here :)
[03:46:34] <Grundell> Well i have this page (http://dressupinyou.se/) and when you look at it in mobile view i have a dropdown from the topmenu (red one) where it says "F√• offert!" now the dropdown is positioned absolute but if i try to change it to position fixed so it fallows me when i scroll down on the page it stops working...
[03:46:47] <Grundell> So i thought if someone could help me out fixing it :)
[03:46:50] <dwarder> why doesn't it work http://jsfiddle.net/87KLE/
[03:47:21] <Grundell> (with mobile view i refer to 480px -> 768px width )
[03:47:27] <dwarder> nevermind
[03:49:36] <Grundell> nevermind fixed it :D
[03:50:31] <Archer_xda> Grundell: Cool - glad you sorted it :)
[03:50:42] <Grundell> Archer_xda: Thanks mate!
[03:51:01] <Grundell> Archer_xda: Always uplifting with someone that is polite :)
[03:53:23] <Archer_xda> Grundell: I agree.  I always appreciate a bit of courtesy.  Not a requirement though.  Bosses grunt commands.  I still do them :p
[03:53:45] <ocx> Cork: if ($('$event_id').prop('checked')) {  <--- should i use it like that or event_id without the dollar sign
[03:54:54] <Grundell> Archer_xda: Always will :)
[03:55:49] <Archer_xda> ocx: What is $event_id?  If it's an element ID then it should be $('#event_id')
[03:56:23] <ocx> $event_id = "#checkbox-01"
[03:56:38] <ph1> can anyone help me convert what a small php piece of code is doing so I can include it in my jquery script?
[03:57:52] <Archer_xda> ocx: if you want to cache the jQuery object then $event_id = $("#checkbox-01")
[03:58:07] <Archer_xda> and if ($event_id.prop('checked'))
[03:59:20] <ocx> Archer_xda: what is difference between using event_id and $event_id
[04:00:38] <Archer_xda> ocx it's just a variable name, but it's good practice (and many will recommend) that you prefix jQuery objects with $ so that you know elsewhere in the code that that's what you're referring to.  It's a good reminder
[04:00:56] <ocx> so event_id and $event_id point to the same thing
[04:01:00] <dwarder> YO
[04:02:19] <Archer_xda> ocx: You use one or the other - they are different
[04:02:52] <ph1> here is the php code - from what I can tell there are similar functions etc in jquery that can do the same thing ... http://bin.cakephp.org/view/734665400
[04:03:44] <ocx> Archer_xda: so if i declahre $tag and use tag in my code i will not be able to read it?
[04:04:00] <ph1> I just want to include that in this jquery script: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1184165056
[04:06:53] <Archer_xda> ocx: No.  It is a literal name.  I just suggest using $name when it's something like $name = $("#elementID") so that you know it's a jQuery object.  If it weren't then using $ would just confuse the issue.
[04:07:23] <Archer_xda> ocx: In 6 month's time you'll look back at your code and instantly know that all var with a $ prefix are jQuery objects, not just regular vars
[04:09:36] <Archer_xda> ocx: But, if you're not caching the jQuery object then you can simply use - if ($("#checkbox-01").prop('checked')) {...
[04:09:54] <ocx> what is the difference between caching or not
[04:11:29] <jim87> hello! I'd like to know if an element is in the current viewport (already did it) and if it's not overlayed by another element (the problem). Is there a plugin maybe, or any hint on the logics? These elements have different z-index values
[04:11:57] <Archer_xda> ocx: If your code is using $("#checkbox-01") repeatedly then you should do something like var $checkbox01 = $("#checkbox-01"); and then use $checkbox01 everywhere instead.  When you ask jQuery to select an element it has to parse the DOM every time.  What you're doing is keeping a local reference to the element that it returns, so it doesn't have to search for it every time
[04:12:25] <ocx> cool
[04:12:45] <Uhkis> jim87: get elements size and position (relative to viewport) and then check z-index?
[04:13:20] <interop_madness> how do you guys work around the undeserializibility of Datetimes for $.ajax calls? i.e. i have webservices which return objects that may or may not have date properties and currently, at every place where i use them, i have to manually deserialize the datetime strings returned from the webservice.
[04:13:26] <jim87> Uhkis: thus I'd have to make a cycle each time I have to check if an element with a higher z-index value is in the same place?
[04:13:53] <Uhkis> jim87: pretty much
[04:13:53] <jim87> I hoped there was a method in jQuery able to "see" the layered structure
[04:14:01] <jim87> ok thanks Uhkis :)
[04:14:05] <interop_madness> naive idea: enumerate all webservices that may return dates and wrap the ajax calls for each of them in specialized wrapper functions which themselves perform the conversion
[04:15:57] <ocx> Archer_xda: here is my first function code written in jquery: http://pastebin.com/UkZDU5LF do you think it looks good?
[04:16:05] <Archer_xda> interop_madness: You should really sanitize the datetime objects before serializing them as most languages treat datetimes differently.  I'd recommend converting to a string in the format yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm:ss
[04:17:24] <interop_madness> Archer_xda, .NET serializes datetime to "\Date(<timestamp>)\" which i can rely on
[04:18:16] <interop_madness> so the string representation can be assumed, but still i have to deserialize every place i call $.ajax() for some of the webservices
[04:18:19] <Archer_xda> interop_madness: But you're saying you can't rely on it??  When going from one language to another you're better of sanitizing it yourself
[04:18:55] <interop_madness> Archer_xda,  the webservice is .NET and stays .NET. my problem is that there is no DateTime in JSON.
[04:19:55] <ocx> Archer_xda: am i using event_id correctly?
[04:20:04] <Archer_xda> interop_madness:  Are you handling the datetime in Javascript?
[04:20:06] <Archer_xda> ocx : http://pastebin.com/2ekiPA5F
[04:20:48] <interop_madness> Archer_xda, yes. i parse the string and create a Date object for it. problem is, i have to do it everywhere i call $.ajax
[04:20:55] <ocx> Archer_xda:  subscribe_event(this); returns #checkbox-1a ?
[04:21:02] <ocx> i mean this
[04:21:52] <krambiorix> why does this return -1 ? http://jsfiddle.net/2Z2DN/
[04:21:53] <Archer_xda> ocx: this is the DOM element - not a jQuery object.  You can pass that into subscribe_event
[04:22:27] <ocx> Archer_xda: yea the dom element would return what?
[04:22:37] <ocx> a div element?
[04:22:59] <Archer_xda> ocx: whatever has the ID checkbox-2a
[04:25:25] <Archer_xda> interop_madness: You'll have to convert it everywhere because it's coming from a different platform, which is why I suggested serializing it as a common format.  I think the easiest answer for you would just be to write a function to convert the .Net datetime into a JS datetime and use that whenever you need.
[04:26:31] <Archer_xda> interop_madness: You *could* write something to modify ajax responses on a global scale, but it seems overkill, unless this is an existing project with a ton of ajax calls throughout
[04:27:30] <ocx> Archer_xda: ao i uaw element.name instead of .attr(name) right
[04:27:41] <Cork> ocx: what is $event_id meant to be?
[04:27:47] <Cork> LOL
[04:27:54] <Cork> oh, freenode you joker...
[04:28:07] <ocx> $event_id is a $("checkbox-2a);
[04:28:27] <Cork> so $event_id.prop('checked')
[04:29:05] <Archer_xda> ocx: Yes - it's not worth wrapping an element in jQuery to get attributes like that - jQuery(element).attr("name") == element.name
[04:29:06] <Cork> don't forget to enable your +freenode account! :)
[04:29:44] <Cork> Archer_xda: actually prop('name') is not attr('name')
[04:29:45] <ocx> what do you mean Cork
[04:29:59] <Cork> ocx: check your server status

[04:31:37] <krambiorix> Anyone ? why does this return -1 ? http://jsfiddle.net/2Z2DN/
[04:32:09] <Cork> krambiorix: cause window isn't a tr element
[04:32:13] <Cork> so it ins't in the list
[04:33:25] <Archer_xda> Cork: I know - the conversation has moved on a lot since then
[04:33:48] <Cork> Archer_xda: it was just a correction from the line you just typed
[04:33:59] <krambiorix> Cork, what should i put in stead of this then?
[04:34:10] <Cork> krambiorix: what are you trying to do?
[04:34:22] <Cork> the code doesn't make sense on its own
[04:34:30] <Archer_xda> Cork: What I said was correct - I wasn't talking about properties - that was ages ago :)
[04:34:51] <Cork> Archer_xda: 'jQuery(element).attr("name") == element.name' is wrong
[04:34:53] <Archer_xda> Cork: <ocx> Archer_xda: ao i uaw element.name instead of .attr(name) right
[04:35:01] <jim87> I've set an inline CSS value via jQuery, then I try to get it via $('myElement').css('myCssValue'), but it returns the default one, instead of the right one... any hint?
[04:35:22] <jim87> i.e. z-index => 1, when I get it it returns 'auto'
[04:35:24] <Archer_xda> Cork: No it's not wrong
[04:35:28] <Cork> it is
[04:35:36] <krambiorix> Cork, i want to get the index of the row closest to the input element
[04:35:37] <Archer_xda> Cork: No it's not.  Try it
[04:35:41] <Cork> Archer_xda: 'jQuery(element).attr("name") == element.getAttribute("name")' is the same thing
[04:35:59] <Cork> krambiorix: properties and attributes are sometimes the same thing, but not always
[04:36:01] <Cork> opps
[04:36:03] <Cork> Archer_xda: ^
[04:36:20] <Archer_xda> Yes, and "name" is an attribute that is accessible by element.name
[04:36:27] <Cork> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/2Z2DN/1/
[04:36:31] <Cork> Archer_xda: no
[04:36:41] <Cork> element.name is a property not an attribute
[04:36:41] <Archer_xda> Cork: Yes
[04:36:43] <Cork> no
[04:36:49] <mdev> jquery is awesome
[04:36:51] <mdev> thanks
[04:36:55] <Archer_xda> Cork: Okay
[04:37:03] <fabioportieri> jim87: paste code
[04:37:21] <Cork> Archer_xda: check the difference between .attr('href') and elm.href if you don't believe me
[04:38:20] <Cork> Archer_xda: http://jsfiddle.net/xfA23/
[04:38:46] <jim87> fabioportieri: http://pastebin.com/GKEwjKQW - first redraw is called, then calculatePaginationStatus
[04:39:05] <bobbobbins> if i have a bunch of nested lists, and someone clicks something in one of them, is there a way to get the number for how deep its nested?
[04:39:06] <Cork> Archer_xda: and for comparison http://jsfiddle.net/xfA23/1/
[04:39:16] <jim87> z-index values will always return 'auto' (instead of the set values)
[04:39:26] <jim87> in the DOM the inline property is correctly set
[04:39:32] <ocx> Archer_xda: http://pastebin.com/2ekiPA5F the else is not matching correctly
[04:40:17] <krambiorix> Cork , yeah just found that out, thanks
[04:41:20] <Cork> krambiorix: you ran the code in onload, and this is the same as window in that context
[04:41:49] <Cork> krambiorix: so you checked for the index of the window in the list of matches, not what you wanted :)
[04:42:00] <Archer_xda> Cork: Sorry - my mistake.  I honestly thought name was an attribute
[04:42:07] <Archer_xda> I would have put all my money on that!
[04:42:14] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks for the info!
[04:42:16] <Cork> Archer_xda: it is an attribute
[04:42:24] <Cork> but element.<anything> isn't
[04:42:34] <Cork> getAttribute gives you the attributes
[04:42:43] <Cork> or element.attributes
[04:43:21] <Johnathan1707> Getting an error running this code https://gist.github.com/Johnathan/2cdc4d44981481385bad, error is  "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'top' in undefined" any idea why it's doing that?
[04:43:24] <fabioportieri> jim87: i think the error is in line 25
[04:43:35] <fabioportieri> jim87: inViewport.push($(this));  redo in inViewport.push(this);
[04:43:53] <Archer_xda> Cork: So why does this work? http://jsfiddle.net/xfA23/2/
[04:44:06] <jim87> fabioportieri: thanks, will do that. I've tried console logging it though separately and still the 'auto' value is shown
[04:44:12] <fabioportieri> jim87: you are currently doing something like $($(elem)).css...
[04:44:23] <jim87> yep noticed that
[04:45:24] <Cork> Archer_xda: cause the property name has the same value as the attribute name
[04:45:56] <Cork> Archer_xda: and i don't think any element ever separates those
[04:46:51] <jim87> fabioportieri: fixed that issue, though the error persists: http://pastebin.com/index/GKEwjKQW
[04:47:01] <Cork> Archer_xda: so my problem was with you stating that it is the same thing, as it isn't, though for some fields it has the same value
[04:47:44] <fabioportieri> jim87: i'm still seeing inViewport.push($(this)); tho
[04:48:14] <jim87> fabioportieri =\ I've copied the new version, wait...
[04:48:37] <jim87> fabioportieri: forgot to submit :P http://pastebin.com/NV56j2de
[04:49:51] <fabioportieri> did you clear the browser cache i.e. you sure the new version is being executed?
[04:49:51] <Archer_xda> Cork: I guess I've been very luck with my use of that so far then.  Thanks for correcting me :)
[04:50:17] <Cork> Archer_xda: as a side note, that difference is why we have .prop now days
[04:50:42] <jim87> yep fabioportieri. The problem though is showing in the console, too. I've double-checked and z-index is correctly set inline, but doing something like $('.page').css('z-index') will return "auto"
[04:51:02] <imoification> ...
[04:51:04] <Cork> Archer_xda: before attr did a miss-mach of the values from getAttrubute(name) and [name]
[04:51:24] <Cork> Archer_xda: but as what data you might want might differ, so they split it up to be attr and prop
[04:51:29] <fabioportieri> jim87:  and if you inspect .page element it has an inline z-index != auto?
[04:51:40] <ankurk_> So I have a table row that has a edit button to edit the record, it triggers a bootstrap modal. My question is how can I get the record closest to the button that triggers the modal?
[04:51:55] <jim87> fabioportieri: it has the correct value, i.e. from 0 up to (.page).length -1
[04:52:05] <jim87> (depending on the element of course9
[04:52:06] <jim87> )
[04:52:13] <Cork> Archer_xda: one point where one really see the difference is when you want to do something like $($(this).attr('href')).focus() for link hashes
[04:52:34] <Archer_xda> Cork: That's the kind of thing I've used it for regularly - this.href or this.id
[04:52:47] <Archer_xda> Cork: I guess an assumption grew over time and 0 failures
[04:52:54] <Cork> Archer_xda: but you would have to grab the end of the href if you used a property
[04:53:10] <Cork> as elem.href would include the full url
[04:53:37] <Cork> <a href="#top"> elm.href == "http://www.example.com/path/file.html#top"
[04:54:13] <Cork> while attr would be just "#top"

[04:59:35] <relipse> or anyone know anyone who has done this before
[04:59:52] <fabioportieri> i used jcrop for that
[05:00:29] <jim87> relipse: pasteboard.co is opensource and I find it awesome
[05:00:41] <relipse> i've used jcrop was looking for something else thanks
[05:01:08] <jim87> fabioportieri any clue on my problem? z-index seems to be the only "ignored" style property
[05:01:13] <jim87> (in jQuery only)
[05:01:29] <relipse> jim87 nice! have you utilizied it in your own projects
[05:01:51] <jim87> TBH nope, never had to use a crop library :)
[05:03:31] <fabioportieri> jim87: not yet
[05:06:57] <fabioportieri> jim87: try moving line 35 in line 30
[05:07:09] <fabioportieri> i don't understand why the nested .each
[05:07:41] <jim87> fabioportieri: it's an un-elegant way to check each element with each element
[05:07:49] <jim87> do you know any better solution?
[05:08:41] <jim87> fabioportieri: btw same result, "auto auto"
[05:13:01] <relipse> jim87: is it possible to use pasteboard without node and instead php
[05:14:42] <jim87> relipse: I think the JS frontend is separated from the back-end
[05:14:53] <relipse> thats what i need then
[05:14:57] <relipse> ok looking into it now
[05:15:07] <jim87> relipse: btw you can still proxy nodejs via apache, if you want
[05:15:53] <relipse> can you help me find the js front end: https://github.com/JoelBesada/pasteboard
[05:16:36] <jim87> relipse: should be here, in cofee: https://github.com/JoelBesada/pasteboard/tree/master/assets/js
[05:17:13] <relipse> i love coffee
[05:17:16] <fabioportieri> jim87: can't spot the error, you should setup a jsfiddle for more help..
[05:17:49] <jim87> fabioportieri: $('.page').get(0).style seems to work though
[05:18:04] <jim87> how can I get the value? $('.page').get(0).style returns CSSStyleDeclaration
[05:18:40] <jim87> $('.page').get(0).style['z-index']
[05:18:49] <jim87> i.e. current.style['z-index']
[05:18:53] <jim87> strange behavior though
[05:19:19] <fabioportieri> .style.zIndex
[05:19:34] <jim87> nope, it's an array, not an object
[05:19:53] <fabioportieri> oh, ok
[05:21:05] <Cork> jim87: or you could just use .css() instead
[05:21:08] <fabioportieri> jim87: uhm you sure? doesn't work to me in the array notation
[05:21:22] <Cork> $('.page').get(0).style['z-index'] => $('.page').css('z-index')
[05:21:49] <CrowX-> why does "TweenMax.to($(self.row), 0, {display:block});" gives me "Uncaught ReferenceError: block is not defined"?
[05:22:12] <fabioportieri> aniway reboot
[05:23:03] <CrowX-> and self.row is defined like this "self.item = $(event.target);"
[05:26:56] <ankurk_> Is there any way I can pass a reference to a button to a bootstrap modal?
[05:27:35] <Archer_xda> CrowX - { display: "block" }
[05:28:00] <xKraty> ankurk_: bootstrap modal sucks
[05:28:04] <Archer_xda> CrowX - the names can be without quotes (if there's no -), but the values (if strings) MUST be in quotes
[05:28:35] <imoification> what is wrong with the bootstrap modal?
[05:31:27] <CrowX-> Archer_xda, thank you. it works now.
[05:31:40] <Archer_xda> CrowX - no worries :)
[05:37:25] <ocx> how can i display a div element or a <p> from inside jquery into html
[05:38:00] <fabioportieri> .appendTo(), ocx
[05:39:30] <ocx>  var $tag = $("<p>" + tag + "</p>");                                                                                  |<div class="ui-field-contain" data-theme="d" >  var $removeButton = $("<input type='button' class='removeTagButton' value='Remove' />");                             |  <fieldset data-role="controlgroup">  $tag.append($removeButton);                                                                                           
[05:40:21] <fabioportieri> ocx: that way you are appending removeButton to tag, but you still need to append tag to the dom
[05:40:59] <ocx> var $tag = $("<p>" + tag + "</p>");        <--- here jquery will look for the <p>tag</p> in DOM and store it in $tag ?
[05:41:02] <dwarder> i have 'this' in onclick event
[05:41:13] <dwarder> how do i use :first-child with it?
[05:41:58] <fabioportieri> ocx: no, there you will create a p element and reference it to variable $tag, but is not in your page yet, you'll have to do $tag.appendTo("body"); or something
[05:42:06] <ocx> fabioportieri: $("    ")  will always search in dom right?
[05:42:10] <ocx> ah
[05:42:46] <ocx> how come $("$divid") searchs in dom and does not create a new element?
[05:42:59] <ocx> i mean $(#div_id")
[05:43:26] <fabioportieri> ocx: because you didn't do $("<someTag></someTag>")
[05:44:08] <fabioportieri> ocx: when you see a tag with brackets inside jquery selector you are creating dom elements on the fly
[05:44:16] <ocx> so mainly $("#tag") searches in dom for that div with id tagm whereas $("<div>tag</div>") will create a new div
[05:44:21] <ocx> ok
[05:44:35] <ocx> good to know
[05:44:40] <ocx> thanks
[05:44:49] <fabioportieri> yep, you're welcome
[05:46:59] <ocx> $("<p>value</p>").append(body);
[05:47:11] <ocx> will add at the end of body
[05:47:25] <m1su> appendTo() is what you need
[05:48:13] <ocx> ok
[05:48:13] <fabioportieri> ocx: append() != appendTo()
[05:48:17] <ocx> yea i noticed
[05:49:18] <ph1> can anyone help me transfer a small bit of PHP code into my jquery script? This is my jquery script: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1444542888 and this is my php code: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/962337063. Basically I have a webpage with 3 dropdown boxes, and the php code there is taking the id for each record returned and replacing it with the name field, so basically the names are being displayed in the provinces and cities dropdown boxes, but I just want to mani
[05:49:18] <ph1> pulate the array straight in jquery instead.
[05:50:29] <ph1> this is an example of the array $provinces being returned: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1867015288
[06:00:58] <sdwrage> Hey all
[06:02:04] <sdwrage> Is anyone familiar with bxslider? I have li elements that each hold an image and a title to describe the image. I need to set the current slide to whatever slide an element is in that I am selecting with a selector
[06:02:52] <sdwrage> example -> $("#slide-item-5"); I need to select whatever parent slide holds that element and set it to it
[06:12:31] <bowenac_> hello anyone use full calendar? I am trying to change the date to use yyyy-MM-dd hh:mm TT which works fine in the calendar, I am inserting the date into mysql as varchar which inserts as 2014-04-14 12:00 AM which is how I want it
[06:12:48] <bowenac_> but then the events do not display on the calendar anyone have any ideas what else needs to be done?
[06:12:54] <ocx> i am running $("<p>value</p>").appendTo(body) in html header section and getting Uncaught ReferenceError: body is not defined  , shnould i execute this script after <body> loads?
[06:13:19] <Cork> ocx: you need to use the ready function
[06:13:25] <bowenac_> if I change it to this var startDate = $.fullCalendar.formatDate(start, "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"); and change the insert to datetime it works fine
[06:13:56] <bowenac_> but it inserts as 2014-04-22 00:00:00
[06:14:00] <Archer_xda> ocx: You need to execute it at document.ready - http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[06:14:02] <bowenac_> for 12am
[06:18:05] <sdwrage> if I have a list, and I want to select an li, how can I check to see what position that li is in?
[06:22:07] <jcool> I need to set my dropdown with json response I recive.
[06:22:24] <jcool> I am getting good json response what I need, but it is unable to set that on my destination
[06:23:26] <jcool> http://jsfiddle.net/BgN3H/ code for jquery.
[06:23:46] <jcool> json response I get: http://awesomescreenshot.com/0062kyre30
[06:24:21] <jcool> I am trying to set it to #province which is a dropdown, but I am getting json response as object. is that an issue?
[06:34:35] <ocx> Archer_xda: Cork document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);still getting that error
[06:35:03] <Cork> ocx: sounds like a phonegap specific thing then
[06:36:22] <frank_o> Howdy!
[06:36:28] <Cork> jcool: you need to generate dom element from the json you have
[06:36:42] <ocx> Cork: correct code ? http://pastebin.com/5FNKC6AM
[06:36:43] <frank_o> Anybody know why overflow scrolling won't work in jQuery Mobile's panel? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/4Q8yb/ (using the https://github.com/filamentgroup/Overthrow polyfill)
[06:37:04] <Cork> jcool: and i don't see you ever using the provinces data anywhere in the code dump you posted
[06:37:25] <jcool> Cork: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1968233360
[06:37:25] <Cork> ocx: no
[06:37:30] <Cork> document.body not body
[06:37:49] <ocx> ahh
[06:38:02] <Cork> jcool: that is php, not anything that can handle something client side
[06:38:37] <jcool> Cork: that is my form that is shown to user.
[06:38:59] <jcool> Cork: you can see a form input there. having province as its id.
[06:39:35] <Cork> jcool: sure, but when you later send new options through ajax, you need to use that data to fill the select element
[06:41:04] <ocx> jcool: can you code php with phonegap?
[06:41:22] <ocx> on client side ? :/
[06:41:41] <jcool> ocx: I am sorry. I dont know what you meant :)
[06:41:54] <jcool> Cork: I am just running it again. I think I have got that ;)
[06:42:08] <Cork> jcool: ok, so you run the server code again
[06:42:15] <Cork> then where does the json come into the picture?
[06:42:16] <jcool> Cork: I wrapped my json with option tag and then set it on #province.
[06:42:35] <Cork> jcool: but that code isn't in your pb
[06:42:51] <jcool> Cork: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1502727178
[06:42:55] <jcool> I am sorry for that.
[06:43:04] <jcool> Cork: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/962337063
[06:43:16] <Cork> none of that can help you with json
[06:43:18] <Cork> it is php
[06:43:31] <jcool> you can see a little tool I am using over there.
[06:43:39] <jcool> it makes me my json response.
[06:43:44] <Cork> ...
[06:43:57] <jcool> it is built by someone in cakephp and i use tthat.
[06:44:03] <Cork> jcool: you need to take the json you generate and convert it into dom elements
[06:44:17] <Cork> and currently you haven't showen any such code
[06:44:29] <ocx> Cork: ok now no exceptions but i cant see the <p> in my body $("<p>WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</p>").appendTo(document.body);
[06:44:35] <ph1> Cork, what are dom elements?
[06:44:55] <Cork> ph1: it is what the browser uses to draw the page
[06:45:05] <Cork> ph1: html is converted into a dom document with dom elements
[06:45:19] <Cork> ocx: that should work
[06:45:27] <ph1> ok
[06:45:28] <jcool> Cork: http://awesomescreenshot.com/0702kz0j01
[06:45:48] <Cork> ... that isn't the json you showed before
[06:46:02] <jcool> Cork: made a slight change and now I get this json.
[06:47:00] <jcool> Cork: I am sorry but I am new to this jquery thing. I dont know much abt it but I tried my best to provide you will all links.
[06:47:43] <Cork> jcool: well with the later json response.content should work if you set the html or append on the select element
[06:47:51] <jcool> Cork: yes :)
[06:48:23] <jcool> Cork: in order to set content on select element we need to have json wrapped with option tag as I showed right?
[06:48:39] <Cork> no
[06:48:42] <ph1> Cork, sorry he is confusing you there - the response he just showed you is not the json response
[06:49:01] <Cork> but you need to generate valid html or dom elements before you try to append them
[06:49:04] <ph1> that is the json response that has been manipulated by a php script and wrapped in option tags
[06:49:36] <ph1> Cork, the first json response he gave you is the response we are talking about and what we need to get working
[06:49:53] <jcool> Cork: ah cool. I think I am getting it slowly.
[06:49:59] <Cork> then you need to generate either dom elements from it
[06:50:00] <Cork> or html
[06:50:48] <ph1> Cork, Neon told us that we need to loop the json response in jquery and wrap it in option tags and then jam it into the $(‚Äòselect‚Äô).html(myVarList)
[06:52:12] <Cork> destination.html($.map(response.provinces, function(id, value) { '<option value="' + id + '">' + value + '</option>'; }));
[06:52:13] <ph1> Cork, could you give us a quick example of how to do that in jquery based on the json response jcool first gave you?
[06:52:18] <Cork> opps
[06:52:23] <Cork> destination.html($.map(response.provinces, function(id, value) { '<option value="' + id + '">' + value + '</option>'; }).join(''));
[06:52:41] <Cork> sigh and another miss
[06:52:50] <Cork> destination.html($.map(response.provinces, function(id, value) { return '<option value="' + id + '">' + value + '</option>'; }).join(''));
[06:52:56] <Cork> that is the html solution
[06:53:09] <jcool> so we are wrapping the response we get in to html and den setting it on province.
[06:53:20] <ocx> Cork: //window.localStorage.setItem("key", "valueB"); <--- this is stored as a cookie in the browser?
[06:53:22] <jcool> yay! great to learn ! :)
[06:53:28] <Cork> destination.html($.map(response.provinces, function(id, value) { return $('<option>', { value: id, text: value })[0]; }));
[06:53:35] <Cork> and that is the dom element solution
[06:54:00] <jcool> Cork: thanks for that. will give it a try and let you know :)
[06:54:01] <ocx> if i close and reopen my browser Cork the value is retained
[06:54:05] <ocx> so wondering where it is stored
[06:54:15] <ph1> Cork, thanks again :)
[06:54:22] <Cork> ocx: no it stores a value in the localstore database
[06:54:28] <Cork> ph1, jcool: np
[06:54:53] <krambiorix> does anyone know how the dotted line around an element is called for people who don't see very good?
[06:54:54] <Cork> ocx: localStorage is a fairly new storage api implemented in modern browsers
[06:55:08] <Cork> krambiorix: outline
[06:55:20] <Cork> wait for ppl that don't see?
[06:55:27] <ocx> Cork: and it lives even when computer is restartewd?
[06:55:28] <Cork> not sure what you talk about
[06:55:39] <krambiorix> Cork, what's the use of that outline then?
[06:55:41] <Cork> ocx: it lives until the user or the site removes it
[06:55:52] <ocx> user of the site?
[06:55:53] <Cork> krambiorix: to identify focused elements
[06:56:09] <ocx> you mean the webmaster?
[06:56:11] <Cork> ocx: yes there is sessionStorage that is for the current session only
[06:56:11] <krambiorix> Cork, ow :)
[06:56:15] <Cork> ocx: no
[06:56:39] <Cork> ocx: the data is never removed automatically
[06:56:56] <Cork> ocx: the user can manually purge all storage data (in some browsers)
[06:56:58] <ocx> yea i mean when is it removed? when cache is cleared?
[06:57:02] <ocx> ok
[06:57:06] <Cork> ocx: or the website can run a command to remove it
[06:57:14] <Cork> except for those cases it isn't removed
[06:57:19] <ocx> thats a better way of using cookies?
[06:57:51] <Cork> ocx: localstorage is better then cookie cause it isn't transmitted to the server on every request you ever make (including loading images)
[06:58:41] <Cork> ocx: but on the other hand, it is synchron, so you take a page load hit instead
[06:58:57] <Cork> ocx: well if you have more then just a little data at least
[06:59:08] <ocx> can we store an image in that stored?
[06:59:13] <Cork> ocx: to handle that indexedDB was introduced
[06:59:14] <ocx> local storage
[06:59:26] <Cork> ocx: yes, but it has to be escaped into strings
[06:59:31] <Cork> so it takes a lot of space
[06:59:46] <ocx> maybe even a video then
[07:00:12] <Cork> ocx: there is a limit to how much data a site is allowed to store
[07:00:18] <ocx> i see
[07:00:28] <ocx> what do you mean by this  <Cork> ocx: but on the other hand, it is synchron, so you take a page load hit instead
[07:00:54] <Horacsio> one basic question
[07:01:16] <Horacsio> in .fadeToggle() what does the dot stands for?
[07:01:32] <Cork> ocx: when the page loads, before it starts handling anything from the page
[07:01:48] <Cork> ocx: it needs to frees everything while it loads the entire database for the page from disk
[07:01:55] <ocx> ok
[07:02:06] <Cork> ocx: as it has to have the data on hand, as it doesn't use callbacks
[07:02:20] <Cork> so when js asks for it it has to be able to give it back directly
[07:02:27] <ocx> yes
[07:02:49] <Cork> ocx: so depending on the size of the database, and the speed of the storage media
[07:03:02] <Cork> that can be a significant loading penalty
[07:03:16] <ocx> so you saying maybe if it gets it from the internet website it will faster access compared to a big local database with i/o limitation
[07:03:27] <Cork> ocx: btw i think the default localstorage size for most browsers is about 5 mb
[07:03:41] <Cork> ocx: it might be, yes
[07:03:49] <ocx> well said Thanks
[07:03:57] <Cork> ocx: cause if you fetch it from the net it ends up in the browsers normal cache
[07:04:03] <Cork> and you only load it when you need it
[07:04:05] <ocx> yea
[07:04:10] <Cork> with localstorage it is always loaded
[07:04:22] <Cork> even if you arn't even using localstorage at all on the specific page
[07:04:28] <Cork> (but you have something stored for the domain)
[07:04:35] <ocx> makes things slow maybe
[07:04:41] <Cork> it might ya
[07:04:59] <Cork> it's not really possible to give a clear answer, and the device it runs on matters a lot
[07:07:40] <bowenac> anyone use fullcalendar?
[07:09:58] <ocx> btw Cork if you open chrome incognito the localstorage is disabled
[07:10:20] <Cork> ya
[07:10:27] <Cork> it doesn't store cookies or images either
[07:10:43] <Cork> that's kinda the point with incognito mode
[07:11:51] <Horacsio> in .fadeToggle() what does the dot stands for?
[07:12:29] <ocx> Cork: i am using this local storage to track if the app is opened for the first time it works :) something like : http://pastie.org/8985768
[07:13:30] <xec> Horacsio: it doesn't mean anything on its own, but if there is an object (reference) before it, that's what you're calling it on. it's called "dot notation"
[07:13:55] <Cork> ocx: why are you loading the key value twice?
[07:14:10] <Cork> line 8 is redundant
[07:14:12] <Horacsio> $("#te").bind('click', function() like what in here?
[07:14:12] <ocx> correct
[07:14:27] <xec> Horacsio: say you have an object called "car" with a property named "wheels", you would access it using dot notation "car.wheels"
[07:14:49] <Horacsio> calling wheels for the car, right?
[07:14:55] <xec> Horacsio: in that case, $() is a function returning a jquery object, and "bind" is a method on the jquery object
[07:15:34] <xec> Horacsio: http://www.dev-archive.net/articles/js-dot-notation/
[07:15:40] <Horacsio> in that case I'm calling bind for #te, right?
[07:16:03] <xec> essentially, yes
[07:17:03] <xec> first you're executing the "$" function, passing in a "#te" string. then jquery will find an element with that ID and return a jquery collection object with that element. then you call the "bind" method on the jquery object
[07:17:04] <Horacsio> alone, is just a representation...
[07:17:34] <Horacsio> this is very semantic, isn't it?
[07:17:54] <xec> i'm not sure what you mean by that
[07:18:00] <xec> it's basic javascript syntax
[07:18:22] <xec> the dot in itself has nothing to do with the jquery library
[07:22:06] <Horacsio> I mean, that every part of the code has a correlational position. I'm sorry, I'm very rookie in terms of coding... so I'm having kind of first revelations here :)
[07:22:39] <Cork> Horttcore: what language do you come from?
[07:22:48] <Cork> *Horacsio:
[07:22:58] <Cork> or do you have any coding history?
[07:23:18] <Horacsio> or?
[07:23:30] <Cork> "what language do you come from? or do you have any coding history?"
[07:24:11] <Cork> it might be easier to explain if you have something to make parallels to
[07:26:45] <Horacsio> no coding history. I'm learning... absorbing knowledge from wordpress related languages
[07:27:03] <Horacsio> css, php, jquery,... but very very rookie
[07:27:07] <Horacsio> yet :)
[07:36:07] <CrowX-> with TweenMax I want to move object to the top of its container using TweenMax.to($(item), 0.5, {position:'absolute',top:0}); It moves the object to the top, but instantly, when it's supposed to do it for 0.5 seconds
[07:36:11] <CrowX-> why is this?
[07:39:23] <ph1> Cork, I don't think I've put it in the right place in the code http://bin.cakephp.org/view/145339325, also how do we distinguish between the two? in the code you gave it has response.provinces, but there are two arrays, the first one is the one you saw provinces, and once we select the province the cities array is returned.
[07:40:19] <ph1> Cork, also is that code looping through the json resonse already? or we need to do a for each or something?
[07:56:28] <DarkGhost> hello everyone, for some reason this wont work! I have no clue why  $("#join-model option").each(function() {console.log("yo");});
[07:57:00] <drej> testcase?
[07:57:16] <xec> DarkGhost: what does your html look like?
[07:57:37] <drej> ch'mon DarkGhost  you should know this by now!
[07:57:37] <drej> :)
[07:58:13] <DarkGhost> lol drej  whats up
[07:58:22] <DarkGhost> well it's hard to show because all this html is dynamically loaded and I think that some of the problem
[07:58:26] <DarkGhost> its trying to find option before the option is loaded
[07:58:30] <DarkGhost> (i didn't cod ethis site, its piss poor)
[07:58:54] <CrowX-> DarkGhost, make sure the element is loaded first then
[07:59:12] <seutje> put a debugger statement in there and check when it's being called, is the element in the page at that point?
[07:59:12] <DarkGhost> oh well i just did console.log($("bla").html()); and it is loaded!
[07:59:12] <DarkGhost> so hmm
[07:59:17] <CrowX-> add this code at the oncomplete part or w/e to the function that loads the content
[07:59:34] <xec> DarkGhost: in console or in script file?
[07:59:35] <DarkGhost> just kidding i checked wrong element
[07:59:38] <DarkGhost> yeah the code isn't loaded yet
[07:59:47] <DarkGhost> its not loading for some reason..
[07:59:53] <xec> tried docready?
[07:59:55] <DarkGhost> how can I check until options are in there?
[08:00:00] <DarkGhost> yeah all of this is in docready
[08:01:58] <DarkGhost> it is laoded though!!!
[08:05:43] <SprkDev> I've implemented ajax which works perfectly. Only one catch, my htm5 required field is now getting ignored, and an empty field is being allowed. I don't want jquery , js validation here. Anyway to keep html5 working with ajax?
[08:07:24] <mdev> your html5 require field getting ignored?
[08:09:39] <xec> what exactly do you mean by "implemented ajax"?
[08:10:06] <xec> it sounds to me like you're overriding the default submit of a form
[08:10:35] <SprkDev> yeah, ignored.
[08:11:14] <xec> what?
[08:12:12] <xec> oh that was for mdev, neverming
[08:12:16] <xec> nevermind*
[08:12:56] <xec> *afk*
[08:16:16] <Brycetron> Hello I am having trouble getting jquery to work on my website, i am linking the script src's
[08:17:00] <Brycetron> I've tried many different jquery script src links, and still i can't get my jquery to work, any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you
[08:17:39] <mdev> first off the version is important
[08:17:43] <zeroquake> is it possible to block ui with a modal ?
[08:17:50] <mdev> as 2.0 doesn't support old ie I don't think
[08:18:14] <mdev> Brycetron what browser have you tested it with and what does jquery not working mean exactly
[08:18:16] <mdev> not working at all?
[08:18:26] <Brycetron> Google chrome
[08:18:34] <Brycetron> Not working whatsoever.
[08:19:07] <Brycetron> I have tried many different jquery src links in my head, and then made a script.js file, but also tried putting the jquery command code even in the script links
[08:22:35] <NoiseEee> how do you know its not found? what does the debugger show?
[08:23:05] <NoiseEee> Brycetron: i mean, how can we help if you can't get <script src="/any/path/to/jquery.js"> going?
[08:23:59] <seutje> is javascript disabled?
[08:24:13] <jim87> how can I alter the value of margin-left, rather than setting it directly to a value? i.e. animate the CSS property summing or subtracting a value
[08:24:29] <jim87> i.e. marginLeft += 50px
[08:25:11] <seutje> `api animate
[08:25:11] <b-ot> seutje: .animate(): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[08:25:23] <jim87> seutje thanks, I know animate
[08:25:34] <jim87> I don't know how to get the int value of the actual margin
[08:25:53] <seutje> it takes stuff like '+50px'
[08:26:01] <jim87> ah... thanks!
[08:26:04] <seutje> sry, '+=50'
[08:26:12] <seutje> or something, it's in the docs
[08:27:25] <seutje> u can even define ur own step functions and create a rudimentary collision-detection, but I'm not saying you should be using jQuery's animate method for that
[08:29:50] <decx> i tried to do collision detection with markup and nearly died
[08:39:32] <Brycetron> Thank you mdev, you're awesome!!
[08:49:21] <duch_kazatel> If you've ever been "the tech guy" in a business meeting, you'll appreciate this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg
[08:51:00] <Brycetron> Does anyone possibly know why my accordion function is not working on my website?
[08:51:05] <Brycetron> Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.
[08:51:25] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Brycetron
[08:51:25] <b-ot> Brycetron: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:52:36] <Brycetron> http://pastebin.com/geip4yY1
[08:53:08] <duch_kazatel> that... doesn't help.  replicating on jsfiddle is your best bet.
[08:53:24] <duch_kazatel> also - please do not PM without asking first :)
[08:53:34] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/
[08:54:02] <Brycetron> You got it dutch i will not pm you
[08:54:03] <Brycetron> thanks
[08:54:09] <Brycetron> w/o asking first*
[08:54:17] <duch_kazatel> Use this instead - put the html between your body tags in the HTML section, and any javascript you've written in the javascript section.
[08:54:55] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/wTWMA/1/ <- I've started it for you here.
[08:56:07] <Brycetron> The link you provided me is not working.
[08:56:16] <duch_kazatel> correct - I do not have your javascript.
[08:56:38] <duch_kazatel> you need to put your javascript in the javascript pane.
[08:56:43] <Brycetron> The webpage is not loading period
[08:56:52] <duch_kazatel> that's odd.
[08:57:24] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/wTWMA/3/
[08:57:36] <duch_kazatel> try loading just http://jsfiddle.net
[08:57:43] <Brycetron> "initializing the awesome"
[08:57:55] <Brycetron> here we go
[08:58:11] <duch_kazatel> the first one works?
[08:58:14] <Brycetron> w3 works
[08:58:32] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[08:58:36] <Brycetron> So in the javascript section, that's technically going to be my script.js file correct? Sorry it's my first website.
[08:58:44] <Brycetron> I've completed 5 courses on codecademy
[08:58:52] <duch_kazatel> yes.  put your javascript in the script area.
[08:58:55] <Brycetron> language courses, but not it's tough to implement so i appreciate your help.
[08:58:58] <Brycetron> now*
[08:59:07] <Brycetron> Thank you
[08:59:09] <duch_kazatel> we'll fix your HTML in a minute.
[09:00:35] <Brycetron> Okay duch
[09:00:43] <Brycetron> I put the javasript links in the javascript section
[09:00:53] <Brycetron> now what?
[09:00:54] <duch_kazatel> hit "update" and copy/paste the link to here.
[09:01:05] <Brycetron> http://jsfiddle.net/wTWMA/4/
[09:01:07] <Brycetron> ty
[09:01:20] <duch_kazatel> ... huh?
[09:01:29] <duch_kazatel> that's not what i asked you to do.
[09:01:39] <duch_kazatel> take the code from inside your "script.js" file and paste it there.
[09:01:40] <duch_kazatel> nothing else.
[09:01:41] <Brycetron> just put my jquery code in the javascript?
[09:01:42] <Brycetron> okay.
[09:01:50] <duch_kazatel> *javascript.  jquery isn't a language.
[09:01:53] <Brycetron> http://jsfiddle.net/wTWMA/5/
[09:02:15] <duch_kazatel> okay, did you see what I changed with your HTML?
[09:02:15] <Brycetron> I don't understand, what javascript?
[09:02:20] <Brycetron> yes
[09:02:31] <duch_kazatel> the stuff starting with $(document).ready(function(){ - that's javascript.
[09:02:41] <duch_kazatel> jquery is not a language, it's a library.
[09:02:51] <Brycetron> Okay so jquery is just the lniks i'm putting in the html file
[09:02:58] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:03:03] <Brycetron> and javascript is the code, aka, the $(document).ready(function(){
[09:03:04] <Brycetron>     $('#menu').accordion();
[09:03:04] <Brycetron> });
[09:03:19] <Brycetron> I did not know that.
[09:03:20] <Brycetron> Thank you
[09:03:21] <duch_kazatel> html is the stuff in the html file, jquery is a library that you use ith javascript.
[09:03:25] <Brycetron> Now I won't sound like an idiot
[09:03:30] <Brycetron> As much lol
[09:03:36] <Brycetron> Awesome, that's great.
[09:03:43] <Brycetron> I feel more powerful now.
[09:03:49] <Brycetron> ;D
[09:04:00] <duch_kazatel> now, you're trying to use accordion, which isn't included with base jquery
[09:04:13] <Brycetron> Makes sense
[09:04:15] <Brycetron> I had a rough idea..
[09:04:20] <Brycetron> but thank you for clarifying that.
[09:04:24] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/wTWMA/6/
[09:04:30] <duch_kazatel> I've included jquery UI here.
[09:05:26] <Brycetron> How did you include that? you just clicked the tab on left side?
[09:05:33] <duch_kazatel> the checkbox, yes.
[09:05:39] <Brycetron> And also, i thought my code before had that linked into it i could be wrong
[09:05:46] <Brycetron> Because it worked fine on codecademy
[09:05:49] <Brycetron> but not on my site.
[09:05:58] <duch_kazatel> http://pastebin.com/geip4yY1 - this?
[09:06:05] <Brycetron> yes
[09:06:08] <duch_kazatel> because this includes the jquery ui css and javascript, but not jquery itself.
[09:06:25] <Brycetron> really? darn
[09:06:39] <Brycetron> so i was off by a link?
[09:06:45] <duch_kazatel> probably.,
[09:06:46] <Brycetron> I need to add the jquery itself
[09:06:48] <Brycetron> ><
[09:06:57] <duch_kazatel> yes.  jquery, then jqueryui
[09:07:09] <duch_kazatel> jquery is not included by default with browsers.
[09:07:11] <Brycetron> would it be this possibly? <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-2.1.0.min.js"></script>
[09:07:41] <Brycetron> See I haven't been taught at all where to find the links, or what links need to be in the html in order for my javascript to work.
[09:07:42] <duch_kazatel> i don't know - do you have that file downloaded and placed in the same directory as your index.html file
[09:07:53] <Brycetron> Duch, what do you mean by downloaded?
[09:08:03] <Brycetron> I thought all you had to do was link in the src link
[09:08:32] <duch_kazatel> you need to either have it downloaded for the way you have it, or have a full link to it somewhere.
[09:09:32] <Brycetron> I'm very confused, downloaded, you mean i must download the jquery file
[09:09:48] <Brycetron> and then what do I do with it? Because i have downloaded jquery, 2.1 i believe, and it's a bunch of files, i didn't know what to dow ith.
[09:10:07] <duch_kazatel> if you want to use what you pasted, you must download a full copy of that file and place it in the same directory as your index.html file.
[09:10:17] <duch_kazatel> OR you can use a fully qualified URI hosted elsehwere.
[09:10:38] <duch_kazatel> the second option is what you're all ready doing for the jquery ui stuff
[09:10:40] <Brycetron> I have already downloaded Jquery, but it's a bunch of files.
[09:11:00] <Brycetron> like 30 different files, how would i implement them in my html?
[09:11:06] <duch_kazatel> you need only one - it should match the filename in the src="" in your html.
[09:11:23] <Brycetron> So if i just download, lets say, from jquery.com
[09:11:33] <Brycetron> What do I do from there?
[09:11:40] <Brycetron> Does it give me a link to link to my html?
[09:11:47] <duch_kazatel> huh?  no.
[09:11:50] <duch_kazatel> do this
[09:12:05] <duch_kazatel> http://code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.0.min.js - copy all of that and put it into a file named jquery-2.1.0.min.js
[09:12:17] <duch_kazatel> then move that file into the same directory as your index.html file.
[09:12:45] <Brycetron> Okay but I will keep my javascript in script.js file?
[09:12:53] <Brycetron> Just making that clear.
[09:12:58] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[09:12:59] <Brycetron> kk
[09:13:03] <Brycetron> one sec , ty.
[09:13:05] <duch_kazatel> keep your written scrips in a separate file.
[09:13:09] <Brycetron> okay
[09:13:51] <Brycetron> done.
[09:14:31] <duch_kazatel> your other option is to use a hosted copy of jquery - <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
[09:14:38] <duch_kazatel> you are all ready doing that with jqueryui.
[09:14:45] <duch_kazatel> either one should work in your case.
[09:14:53] <NoiseEee> Brycetron: you doing this on a webserer?
[09:14:54] <Brycetron> So duch, i should keep my original file, http://pastebin.com/sK4WYgew
[09:14:55] <NoiseEee> webserver?
[09:14:57] <Brycetron> Yea
[09:15:06] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron huh?
[09:15:15] <Brycetron> So i should keep my original links correct Duch?
[09:15:27] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron sure, though it'd make more sense to use the google hosted jquery ui.
[09:15:37] <duch_kazatel> and put your script.js link after the jquery one.
[09:15:48] <Brycetron> Okay so i made a seperate file, for the jquery one you told me to
[09:16:02] <Brycetron> do i need to put all the other links in that seperate file too? or just leave them as they are in my html as seen on pastebin.org link.
[09:16:14] <duch_kazatel> leave them in the html.
[09:16:22] <duch_kazatel> you should really go read a basic tutorial on HTML.
[09:16:43] <zDog> Anyone know of a good jquery slider like http://www.tabasco.com/ has?
[09:16:46] <duch_kazatel> also: you should really use the google hosted copy of jquery, instead of the local, to reduce confusion for yourself later on
[09:17:59] <duch_kazatel> zDog where's the slider?  you mean the image thing front and center?
[09:18:01] <Brycetron> brb duch my mom needs scraper out of my car
[09:18:57] <zDog> duch, yes, the image thing in the center that lets you select different ones
[09:19:09] <duch_kazatel> any carousel could do that tbh.
[09:19:15] <duch_kazatel> or you could hand roll something.
[09:19:34] <duch_kazatel> be aware though that carousels for major content like that are frowned upon for a variety of reasons.
[09:19:41] <Brycetron> back
[09:19:51] <zDog> yeah i hate sliders, but the client wants it
[09:20:05] <duch_kazatel> ask them why they hate blind people ;)
[09:20:08] <zDog> sites today are boring, slider up top on 99.9% of sites
[09:20:10] <decx> most premade sliders have these little dots, for something like on that tabasco site you basicly just restyle the dots to contain text
[09:21:27] <Brycetron> Hey duch
[09:21:50] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron - if you want my attention, using my full screen name is a good idea, since my client will notify me that i'm being mentioned ;)
[09:21:58] <Brycetron> Okay cool, you got it.
[09:22:01] <Brycetron> ty
[09:22:11] <Brycetron> So i am confused a bit, i just want my code to work so bad lol
[09:22:15] <Brycetron> and i can't get it to work
[09:22:21] <Brycetron> So should i make seperate files for every single hosted source
[09:22:28] <duch_kazatel> http://pastebin.com/RT2Va40H
[09:22:29] <duch_kazatel> use this.
[09:22:49] <duch_kazatel> copy/paste the content of that file and replace everything in your index.html with it.
[09:23:02] <Brycetron> I will delete the other file then right, the jquery file i made?
[09:23:07] <duch_kazatel> yes
[09:23:11] <Brycetron> okay
[09:23:13] <Brycetron> hold on
[09:23:35] <Brycetron> badass.
[09:23:55] <duch_kazatel> check out the include order of the files.
[09:24:03] <duch_kazatel> jquery, then jquery ui, then your stuff.
[09:24:03] <Brycetron> And this is all because you put the jquery link, (the new version), the jquery ui(newest version)
[09:24:05] <krambiorix> how can i find the position (left) of an element relative to the dialog it's in?
[09:24:46] <decx> it's literally position()
[09:24:48] <Brycetron> Awesome duch, thank you! And is that accordion function a one color deal?
[09:24:52] <Brycetron> Or is it possible to change it at all or anything?
[09:24:56] <Brycetron> the color, the shape?
[09:25:07] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron sure.  CSS.
[09:25:16] <Brycetron> haha okay.
[09:25:25] <Brycetron> I get it, i put the javascript last so it loads after the library loadds.
[09:25:31] <Brycetron> And will these hosted links be able to be used forever?
[09:25:35] <duch_kazatel> basically.
[09:25:37] <Brycetron> and is there a link i can find these?
[09:25:41] <Brycetron> so when they update,,, i can get the new version
[09:25:54] <duch_kazatel> https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/devguide#jquery
[09:25:57] <Brycetron> Thank you Duch for your awesomeness.
[09:25:59] <duch_kazatel> but you won't need to update very often.
[09:26:07] <Brycetron> Beautiess.
[09:26:19] <duch_kazatel> HOWEVER, i would suggest ditching at least jquery ui until you learn more basics.
[09:26:51] <Brycetron> I've completed the jquery on codecademy
[09:26:55] <Brycetron> javascript, php, html5 / css
[09:27:17] <Brycetron> I want to make my site pretty on the way of learning more in depth of each
[09:27:29] <duch_kazatel> given the questions I'm seeing, you need to not rely on jquery ui.
[09:27:39] <duch_kazatel> you need to build a better foundation first.
[09:27:49] <Brycetron> I just wanted a tab really bad, but okay
[09:27:53] <Brycetron> you're right, i didn't have a site until yesterday
[09:27:58] <Brycetron> So now i cna make seperate pages
[09:28:06] <duch_kazatel> you wanted a tab?
[09:28:08] <decx> unless you're superhuman i wouldn't try to learn all that stuff simultanously
[09:28:09] <duch_kazatel> that's easy.
[09:28:15] <Brycetron> Lol, my buddy has a masters in software engineering, he said to buy webprogramming step by step book
[09:28:31] <Brycetron> he also told me i should learn simultaneously
[09:28:33] <Brycetron> so i can get good
[09:28:38] <Brycetron> but not the jquery
[09:28:43] <farn5w0rth> I‚Äôm having a resizing issue with a mapCanvas. I made up some JS to calculate the right height to use so my map doesn‚Äôt bleed off the page but if I adjust the browser‚Äôs zoom settings less than or greater than 100%, my map‚Äôs display gets wonky :( https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f5f84a96db26cfed3578
[09:28:44] <Brycetron> but i'll stick with webprogramming for now
[09:28:46] <duch_kazatel> you should learn the three basics of frontend dev - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
[09:29:10] <Brycetron> Duch, any sites you know of that are plain html /css / javascript
[09:29:12] <duch_kazatel> and probably in that order, too, since they build off one another.
[09:29:15] <Brycetron> and are beautiful that i could get ideas from
[09:29:18] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron nope.
[09:29:20] <Brycetron> that are within my grasp
[09:29:21] <Brycetron> okay haha
[09:29:22] <Brycetron> ty
[09:29:30] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron everything I know of would be major web applications.
[09:29:39] <Brycetron> coool
[09:29:46] <duch_kazatel> but seriously, drop the jquery ui.  you will hurt yourself in the lond wrong.
[09:29:47] <Brycetron> How long do you think it will take me to make a cool site
[09:29:47] <duch_kazatel> *run
[09:29:50] <Brycetron> That looks pretty.
[09:29:52] <duch_kazatel> years.
[09:30:01] <Brycetron> Years, awesome LOL not really but oaky
[09:30:04] <Brycetron> i don't have a choice
[09:30:09] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[09:30:17] <duch_kazatel> you're choosing to not learn.
[09:30:19] <Brycetron> So dropping the jquery ui?
[09:30:19] <BillCriswell> guys
[09:30:32] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron start by learning the basics. html, css, and javascript.
[09:30:32] <Brycetron> that will drop my accordion function correct?
[09:30:44] <Brycetron> I already learned the languages 100% on codecademy, what else do you suggest?
[09:30:49] <Brycetron> what are you thinking?
[09:30:54] <duch_kazatel> you didn't learn much.
[09:30:57] <duch_kazatel> you didn'
[09:31:05] <duch_kazatel> *didn't know that jquery isn't a language.
[09:31:07] <Brycetron> Why do you say that?
[09:31:15] <Brycetron> meh, w/e
[09:31:20] <duch_kazatel> learn how to write your own accordion.
[09:31:27] <duch_kazatel> that'd be a good place to start.
[09:31:38] <Brycetron> I'm just going off what they taught me
[09:31:54] <duch_kazatel> i'm telling you how to become a programmer ;)
[09:31:55] <BillCriswell> It feels like a Friday.
[09:32:00] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell right?
[09:32:16] <decx> codeacademy is just the bare minimum, you'll spend years learning the intricacies of the different languages and approaches to webdev
[09:32:17] <frank_o> dont forget to listen to madvillain - accordion for some inspiration ;)
[09:32:29] <duch_kazatel> decx has it spot on.
[09:32:33] <Brycetron> So duch, where should i go next
[09:32:38] <Brycetron> continue building my site, by a webprogramming book?
[09:32:40] <Brycetron> buy*
[09:32:43] <BillCriswell> I wish I knew why accordions were so popular.
[09:32:44] <frank_o> always feels like friday when BillCriswell is around lol
[09:32:48] <Brycetron> Just get the html /css basics down
[09:32:50] <BillCriswell> Hell yeah.
[09:32:50] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron "webprogramming" is not one word btw.
[09:32:55] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: people love to polka
[09:33:01] <Brycetron> The book is literally  called wepprogramming step by step
[09:33:01] <decx> start by doing stuff, "i want to do this and have no idea why" is the receipt to learning useful stuff
[09:33:11] <decx> no idea how" rather
[09:33:16] <erming> browsin' the wep
[09:33:17] <duch_kazatel> www.webstepbook.com
[09:33:23] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron this the book?
[09:33:29] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: or in a Weird Al song.
[09:33:30] <Brycetron> that book correct lol
[09:33:36] <duch_kazatel> "Web Programming Step by Step"
[09:33:44] <Brycetron> Web programming
[09:33:44] <Brycetron> yes
[09:33:50] <Brycetron> not webprogramming
[09:33:56] <Brycetron> lol
[09:34:05] <duch_kazatel> either way, you should start by doing as much as you can with html and css.
[09:34:16] <Brycetron> There has got to be more codecademy html / css stuff
[09:34:16] <duch_kazatel> i'd ignore javascript and its libs completely.
[09:34:29] <duch_kazatel> javascript builds on top of that foundation.
[09:34:36] <Brycetron> right right, the movements of the website = javascript
[09:34:37] <duch_kazatel> well, in the browser anyway.
[09:34:45] <duch_kazatel> javascript does FAR MORE than that.
[09:34:48] <Brycetron> well thanks a lot duch
[09:34:48] <frank_o> isnt it web-programming?
[09:34:57] <duch_kazatel> frank_o nope.
[09:35:04] <Brycetron> duch, where am i going to learn more about css / html5
[09:35:09] <duch_kazatel> just like it's not server-side-programming
[09:35:22] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron pick something to build, then use MDN.
[09:35:26] <Brycetron> What is MDN
[09:35:30] <decx> install firebug and check out what sites do that look interesting
[09:35:40] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML
[09:35:43] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS
[09:36:05] <duch_kazatel> and yes, install firebug, or if you're using chrome use their built-in inspector.
[09:36:31] <duch_kazatel> firefox has a built-in inspector as well, but it's still a little funky imo.
[09:36:56] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: very touchy subject actually
[09:37:05] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:37:09] <Brycetron> Thank you very mcuh for your help Duch.
[09:37:10] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: ie "car damages", is it damages to the car or does the car damage?
[09:37:14] <Brycetron> Good guy
[09:37:28] <Brycetron> Smart too
[09:37:29] <Brycetron> ;D
[09:37:32] <duch_kazatel> frank_o depends on context, like a lot of other things in english.
[09:37:56] <duch_kazatel> "the car damages things"
[09:38:02] <frank_o> yep for sure
[09:38:05] <duch_kazatel> vs "the accident resulted in car damages"
[09:38:50] <Brycetron> One more thing Duch
[09:38:53] <Brycetron> If you don't mind
[09:39:06] <Brycetron> Should i phyiscally download a background picture and upload to my site
[09:39:07] <oniMaker> does anyone know of a nice way to apply an intertial scroll effect to an arbitrary animation?
[09:39:11] <Brycetron> or just use a src link ?
[09:39:40] <Brycetron> anyways im out
[09:39:42] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron if it's from an image host that allows it, link it from them.  otherwise, download and serve up yourself.  but backing up from that.
[09:39:48] <duch_kazatel> don't use a bakcground image.
[09:39:56] <Brycetron> background images are cool?
[09:40:05] <duch_kazatel> not really ;)
[09:40:14] <Brycetron> Like a pattern geeky background image
[09:40:15] <Brycetron> you know?
[09:40:16] <duch_kazatel> depends on what you mean by "background image"
[09:40:26] <duch_kazatel> 9/10, they look cheesy
[09:40:39] <erming> some subtle patterns are nice, but large images as backgrounds.. ugh.. it's hard to pull off
[09:40:55] <Brycetron> yea subtle pattern background is what i want
[09:40:59] <Brycetron> a hidef one
[09:40:59] <duch_kazatel> and if they're high enough resolution to look good on high res monitors, they usually wind up being HUGE.
[09:41:06] <erming> well, speaking about it.. here's a good resource: http://subtlepatterns.com/
[09:41:09] <duch_kazatel> in that case, use a single tile and repeat it.
[09:42:19] <frank_o> So hey anybody know why overflow scrolling won't work in jQuery Mobile's panel widget? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/4Q8yb/ (using the https://github.com/filamentgroup/Overthrow polyfill)
[09:42:25] <Brycetron> okay duch
[09:42:27] <Brycetron> You got it, thanks man!
[09:42:33] <Brycetron> Im getting to work before uhh.... work.
[09:42:35] <Brycetron> Peace out every1
[09:42:38] <duch_kazatel> Brycetron enjoy.
[09:43:38] <duch_kazatel> frank_o where are you defining the height to force scrolling?
[09:44:04] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Never thought of that
[09:44:20] <duch_kazatel> frank_o :) can't scroll if you down't contstrain it.
[09:44:31] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell where were you yesterday?!  it was boring without you.
[09:44:35] <drej> THAS WHAT SHE SAID
[09:44:39] <frank_o> Very good point indeed
[09:44:45] <duch_kazatel> drej unf
[09:45:57] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Since I'm using Overthrow.js though ideally the only thing I'd have to do is apply the "overthrow" class to the div I want to be scrolling
[09:46:20] <frank_o> It works like that everywhere else I'm applying the overthrow class
[09:46:30] <duch_kazatel> where isn't it working, then?>
[09:46:39] <frank_o> In the panel
[09:46:49] <duch_kazatel> you mean on the menu?
[09:46:53] <zeroquake> Anyone knows jquery ui .dialog standalone code ? or alternative thats is light
[09:46:57] <frank_o> Also here using iScroll http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/8CVac/ there was no need to bother with height either
[09:47:11] <frank_o> Yep
[09:47:40] <duch_kazatel> frank_o that's because iScroll does things differently.
[09:48:12] <frank_o> well yeah
[09:48:16] <drej> why iscroll
[09:48:21] <drej> why would you do that
[09:48:32] <frank_o> drej: I dont wanna use iscroll anymore
[09:48:34] <duch_kazatel> and frank_o overthrow is a polyfill.
[09:48:34] <ph1> duch_kazatel, good evening :) Do you think you could help me with this script I have. It's the same one as yesterday but it's evolved a little to include wrapping the out put of json array and putting it into the dropdowns - this is what I have but it's not working.. : http://bin.cakephp.org/view/382360106
[09:48:42] <drej> frank_o so then dont :)
[09:48:49] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: Tried setting height here http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/4Q8yb/2/ no luck though
[09:48:55] <frank_o> drej: I'm not
[09:49:10] <drej> also dont use fixed position frank_o
[09:49:16] <drej> on mobile
[09:49:17] <duch_kazatel> ph1 can you setup an example on jsfiddle?
[09:49:21] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: I know
[09:50:11] <frank_o> drej: probably jquery mobile that set the fixed thing
[09:50:19] <ph1> ok I'll give it a go wait up
[09:50:23] <drej> ew jquery mobile
[09:50:26] * drej shudders
[09:50:45] <frank_o> I don't understand all the hate towards jquery mobile :)
[09:50:57] <duch_kazatel> it's heavy and makes a lot of assumptions for you.
[09:51:00] <duch_kazatel> if that's what you need, great.
[09:51:16] <drej> if you want to prototype something quickly, sure, maybe
[09:51:18] <duch_kazatel> just adds in an extra layer a lot of folks might not necessarily like.
[09:51:22] <drej> but anything production wise, i would stay away from it
[09:51:30] <frank_o> yeah thats true
[09:51:35] <drej> its sluggish, huge, does a lot of dom manipulation that you may not necessarily want
[09:51:40] <drej> any and all customization is nearly impossible
[09:51:48] <drej> aside from colour changes
[09:51:54] <drej> also it once ran over my cat
[09:51:56] <frank_o> from what i hear though they're working really hard on simplifying things
[09:51:57] <drej> so, there's that
[09:52:03] <drej> frank_o yeah but they havent yet
[09:52:07] <drej> id use topcoat personally
[09:52:14] <drej> http://topcoat.io/
[09:52:19] <frank_o> never heard of that one
[09:52:23] <frank_o> nice
[09:52:28] <drej> its not a full framework, but more css structure
[09:52:31] <ph1> duch_kazatel, how do I put in this json data into jsfiddle? http://bin.cakephp.org/view/665315673
[09:52:36] <duch_kazatel> frank_o they are!  jquery ui and jquery mobile are both ggetting a lot of love.
[09:52:56] <drej> only problem is that it will be a while before we see any optimized jquery ui/mobile
[09:53:03] <duch_kazatel> ph1 like this: http://jsfiddle.net/8zggH/
[09:53:06] <ph1> duch_kazatel, also is it easier working with json or xml data in jquery?
[09:53:11] <duch_kazatel> then use yourData wherever you want the data.
[09:53:42] <ph1> duch_kazatel, wow that's really cool
[09:53:56] <duch_kazatel> ph1 huh?  what is?
[09:53:59] <frank_o> drej: yeah that sucks :(
[09:54:24] <ph1> duch_kazatel, how simple it is to put the data into jsfiddle
[09:54:25] <frank_o> i got like my own theme and stuff.. but boy was it hard
[09:54:40] <ph1> it's a cool website that one
[09:54:43] <duch_kazatel> ph1 JSON is basically (but not exactly) a javascript object.
[09:54:53] <frank_o> lots of css i had to reset etc.
[09:55:08] <duch_kazatel> ph1 json is short for "JavaScript Object Notation"
[09:55:17] <ph1> duch_kazatel, ok so better to stick with json then :)
[09:55:19] <duch_kazatel> frank_o that's not going to work well long term.
[09:55:23] <duch_kazatel> ph1 huh?
[09:55:44] <decx> should be called jsonwmdq
[09:55:54] <decx> JavaScript Object Notation with mandatory "" for keys
[09:55:54] <frank_o> duch_kazatel: yeah :/
[09:56:06] <duch_kazatel> decx yessss
[09:56:11] <ph1> just i have 2 options for getting the data out of our database - in json or xml format, so by the sounds of your explanation it would be better to stick with json rather than xml
[09:56:26] <duch_kazatel> ph1 yes, especially if you're going to be using javascrpt.
[09:56:29] <duch_kazatel> *javascript
[09:56:54] <ph1> duch_kazatel, ok cool - I'll just finish the mock up for you in jsfiddle then
[09:56:58] <frank_o> the jqm team promised me though that they'd remove _absolutely all_ non-structure CSS from the structure only CSS
[09:57:22] <frank_o> wait time in effect
[09:57:22] <duch_kazatel> wut.
[09:57:27] <duch_kazatel> oh, i get it.
[09:57:43] <duch_kazatel> i'd still say that there's a certain point where you have to basically admit that you need to not use jquery mobile.
[09:57:44] <frank_o> yeah jqm's structure only css has a lot of "visual" css stuff in it
[09:57:51] <frank_o> haha
[09:58:06] <frank_o> yeah maybe :) well i hope not spent too much time on this already so
[09:58:07] <duch_kazatel> it's fine for something quick, but if you wind up doing a lot of overrides, you should just ditch it.
[09:58:32] <frank_o> just like.. 10 overrides altogether. other than that im pretty happy with the rest
[09:58:46] <frank_o> they're easy to remove come 1.5.0 anyway so
[10:00:04] <duch_kazatel> and decx, JSON is more than that :)
[10:00:07] <duch_kazatel> {"JSON":"rocks!"}
[10:00:11] <duch_kazatel> that fails to parse.
[10:00:28] <duch_kazatel> in javascript at least.  a JSON parser won't shit itself on that one.
[10:01:27] <hlvwrk> how do you combine the function to change the attributes of one element? (  $('.element').attr("placeholder", "Select a date range");  $('.element').attr("readonly", "readonly"); )
[10:01:40] <hlvwrk> is it just, $('.element').attr("placeholder", "Select a date range", "readonly", "readonly");  ?
[10:01:41] <duch_kazatel> hlvwrk ... wut?
[10:01:53] <duch_kazatel> hlvwrk .attr() takes one or two args.
[10:02:04] <hlvwrk> how do you make it accept the two args?
[10:02:18] <duch_kazatel>  $('.element').attr("name", "value")
[10:02:21] <duch_kazatel> that's it.
[10:02:24] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: ... Why does that fail?
[10:02:34] <shoky> .attr({placeholder: .., readonly: ..})
[10:02:41] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell the magical character between ro and cks
[10:02:46] <hlvwrk> thanks shoky. you're always a boss
[10:02:47] <hlvwrk> :P
[10:03:18] <shoky> i hope to never be a boss thx
[10:03:22] <duch_kazatel> hlvwrk https://api.jquery.com/attr/ - you can do this: https://api.jquery.com/attr/#attr-attributes
[10:03:30] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I'm lost.
[10:03:36] <duch_kazatel> which shoky all ready did.
[10:03:41] <BillCriswell> shoky++
[10:03:41] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell http://timelessrepo.com/json-isnt-a-javascript-subset
[10:03:58] <hlvwrk> sooooo.   $('.element').attr({'placeholder': 'Select a date range', 'readonly': 'readonly'})  ?
[10:04:01] <hlvwrk> or no quotes?
[10:04:14] <duch_kazatel> hlvwrk with quotes.
[10:04:17] <shoky> doesn't matter for the keys
[10:04:32] <duch_kazatel> *quotes on the values.
[10:05:56] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I can't even get it to work just typing it out?
[10:06:35] <BillCriswell> Oh shit.
[10:07:00] <hlvwrk> thnkyous
[10:07:03] <hlvwrk> all works beautifully.
[10:08:03] <BillCriswell> The more I think I start to understand something it kind of just slaps me in the face.
[10:08:06] <shoky> might be more proper to use .prop instead of .attr for those
[10:10:05] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i get that, too.  you get that basic understanding and then WHAM! it all falls into place.
[10:11:34] <BillCriswell> {foo:"bar"} returned "bar" to the console, weird. {"foo":"bar"} just fails, ({"foo":"bar"}) is ok though.
[10:12:09] <duch_kazatel> yeah - the parens have to be there.  engine quirks.
[10:14:42] <caciavar> hi all
[10:14:56] <imoification> hello
[10:14:57] <caciavar> I've got this: $('#assessment_form textarea').maxlength({¬†});
[10:15:10] <caciavar> but #assessment_form is loaded by ajax
[10:15:37] <duch_kazatel> caciavar run that code in the .done() callback
[10:15:39] <shoky> BillCriswell it's cause without the parens it's trying to parse it as a block of code, not an object literal
[10:15:43] <duch_kazatel> of the ajax.
[10:15:48] <hlvwrk> shoky is a wizard, i heard.
[10:16:03] <shoky> BillCriswell:  and   foo:"bar"  is valid code,  foo is a label
[10:16:11] <shoky> nothing to do with object literals
[10:16:21] <caciavar> duch_kazatel Thanks, how would I do that?
[10:17:14] <ph1> duch_kazatel, ok here's the mock up jsfiddle - it's very simple because i don't really know how to use it very well just yet. http://jsfiddle.net/3U33f/2/
[10:17:15] <duch_kazatel> caciavar are you using .done() or .success()?
[10:17:17] <shoky> BillCriswell: if you're interested..  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/label
[10:17:25] <caciavar> I don't have either or those
[10:17:41] <caciavar> Maybe the framework I'm using does... b
[10:17:44] <caciavar> I'm not sure
[10:17:45] <duch_kazatel> caciavar then you'll need to set one up.  go read the documentation on $.ajax()
[10:17:47] <ph1> duch_kazatel, the response.content I changed to yourData but I'm not sure if that's correct?
[10:18:10] <caciavar> duch_kazatel Ok. So there's no way to use a $(document).on in this case
[10:18:10] <duch_kazatel> ph1 oh, this won't work in a fiddle unless you setp the fake ajax thinger.
[10:18:32] <ph1> ah
[10:18:39] <BillCriswell> shoky: I was familiar with labels, but never like this.
[10:18:54] <ph1> duch_kazatel, but you can see what we're trying to do still?
[10:19:29] <BillCriswell> Well, never like what I just tried. I've seen them in loops before
[10:19:40] <ph1> just wrapping the json in option tags and html thingies and piping it back into the respective dropbox
[10:19:50] <BillCriswell> I remember someone using "dance" as a label and it said: break dance;
[10:19:56] <shoky> heh
[10:19:58] <duch_kazatel> ph1 are you trying to put selects with JSON?
[10:20:11] <ph1> yes
[10:20:56] <duch_kazatel> okay - I will show you how to do that.
[10:20:59] <ph1> I'm trying to get rid of the php code that's doing it for us at the moment and use straight jquery to populate the dropboxes from the json output
[10:21:25] <ph1> duch_kazatel, thanks heaps :)
[10:22:12] <erming> time to convert this coffee into code
[10:22:20] <ph1> it just means we can replicate this for any other functions we need to do the same thing for and will make our lives a wee bit easier
[10:22:57] <duch_kazatel> it will basically look like this: http://jsfiddle.net/3U33f/3/
[10:24:22] <ph1> duch_kazatel,  ok sweet - i will try and that out thanks alot! :)
[10:24:23] <duch_kazatel> bonus property check: http://jsfiddle.net/3U33f/4/
[10:24:41] <ph1> nice :)
[10:24:48] <ph1> I like bonuses
[10:28:56] <caciavar> duch_kazatel I don't think that's going to work for me. It works when the page first loads, but then when I refresh portions of the page, it doesn't fire that $.ajax().done function
[10:29:24] <duch_kazatel> caciavar "refresh portions of the page" - huh?
[10:29:43] <caciavar> duch_kazatel I have stuff like $(document).on('click', '#form_unlock', function(){
[10:29:59] <duch_kazatel> caciavar that... doesn't change anything about your problem.
[10:30:10] <caciavar> duch_kazael which then does something like this: reloadMetricInto("assessment_form", [GetMetricIDByName("FLSCCA_Assessment_Lock_Change")]);
[10:30:16] <ph1> duch_kazatel, do I need to replace destination.html(response.content) with that whole for statement you gave me?
[10:30:35] <duch_kazatel> caciavar you're not making any sense.  paste it in a fiddle please.
[10:30:50] <duch_kazatel> ph1 that just shows you the basic concept - you'll have to update it to do what you need.
[10:31:21] <caciavar> I'll try, problem is that I'm using a proprietary enterprise framework so I may not be able to recreate the problem in a fiddle
[10:31:26] <ph1> duch_kazatel, eeks ok :)
[10:31:49] <duch_kazatel> caciavar all I can tell you is that you need to init things in the done callback for that related content.
[10:32:53] <caciavar> duch_kazatel k, i'll work on that. thanks
[10:36:25] <ph1> duch_kazatel, the $('select') what is that doing?
[10:36:39] <duch_kazatel> ph1 selecting the select element.
[10:36:47] <duch_kazatel> you should probably go read some basics on jquery.
[10:38:06] <ph1> yes you're right :)
[10:39:15] <duch_kazatel> that's jquery 101 type stuff :)
[10:39:28] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel is always right ph1 :D
[10:39:45] <duch_kazatel> nah - shoky is always right.
[10:41:57] <ankurk_> for some you're :D
[10:42:07] <duch_kazatel> hah.
[10:42:12] <duch_kazatel> well thank you.
[10:43:58] <Fenhl> I want to filter all elements in a selector that are not <a> elements. I'm trying to do this with .filter and a function, but I can't find out how to get the element type from the ‚Äúthis‚Äù variable.
[10:44:26] <duch_kazatel> .nodeType property
[10:44:29] <duch_kazatel> it'll be in all caps.
[10:44:34] <Fenhl> thanks
[10:45:25] <ph1> duch_kazatel, I can't work out where to place that for statement in my jquery. it should be in the function(response) yeah, but I can't even work that out to test the provinces. Can you give me a little more help with that?
[10:46:10] <duch_kazatel> not sure what you mean - you need to iterate over the return and append it to the appropriate select.
[10:49:03] <ph1> so basically that is a separate function for doing that on the province data?
[10:49:08] <Fenhl> also, is there a way to get all elements that are children of the matched element(s), but recursively?
[10:49:42] <Fenhl> I don't want people to be able to hide unwanted elements inside <a> elements
[10:50:45] <duch_kazatel> ph1 or an abstracted function that you pass the object and destinations :)
[10:50:55] <duch_kazatel> Fenhl huh?
[10:51:49] <ph1> duch_kazatel, my god you
[10:52:05] <ph1> duch_kazatel, you're confusing the hell out of me :P
[10:52:36] <Fenhl> duch_kazatel: if my html looks like <a href="//example.org/"><blink>u mad?</blink></a>
[10:52:48] <duch_kazatel> ph1 let me try to demonstrate real quick.
[10:52:49] <Fenhl> duch_kazatel: I want to find the <blink> element
[10:53:03] <duch_kazatel> Fenhl you want all children of a selector?  * works.
[10:53:10] <duch_kazatel> $('a').find('*')
[10:53:23] <Fenhl> ah
[10:53:35] <Fenhl> find is what I was looking for.
[10:54:58] <duch_kazatel> ph1 http://jsfiddle.net/3U33f/5/
[10:55:25] <duch_kazatel> ph1 again, this is basic stuff - you should really go read a tutorial.
[10:56:18] <ph1> duch_kazatel, i know but I'm hacking stuff together on a tight deadline type thing :S
[10:57:06] <duch_kazatel> ph1 then you need to hire a contractor. asking for help like this in a place like #jquery won't get you far - you'll wind up with a really strange solution.
[10:57:06] <drej> ¬∞¬ø¬∫
[10:58:53] <ph1> i'm in the philippines, up in a small country province hacking this together on a personal pc .. that's why I'm here asking for some assistance :P
[10:59:16] <duch_kazatel> ph1 you're doing a lot of copy/pasting and not understanding what you're doing.
[10:59:19] <caciavar> hey duch_kazatel, when I put this inside an ajax .done function like this: $.ajax().done(function(){ $('#assessment_form textarea').maxlength({ ... some stuff }); Then i get 4 XHR events instead of 2. The portions of the page that are being loaded by ajax are now loaded 4 times instead of twice.
[10:59:49] <duch_kazatel> caciavar you should only use that in the necessary callbacks.
[11:00:18] <caciavar> what does that mean?
[11:00:23] <duch_kazatel> not sure how your stuff is structured, but you should have a few ajax functions being called, right?
[11:01:17] <duch_kazatel> because you should only attach that .done(function(){ $('#assessment_form textarea').maxlength({ ... some stuff }); to the relevant ajax calls.
[11:01:48] <caciavar> duch_kazatel I just have a bunch of $(document).on functions and $('#something').change functions
[11:02:07] <duch_kazatel> caciavar something doesn't add up here.  how are you ajaxing in content?
[11:02:30] <duch_kazatel> i may not understand what's going on then.  without seeing the code, it's hard to help.
[11:02:32] <ph1> duch_kazatel, well I understand what I'm wanting to achieve, and there are a huge number of ways of doing the same thing. I think for this jquery is the simplest, yet it's not a language I have any real experience with, so that's why I'm asking the best way to go about doing it. I think I can work with that second one you gave me it makes it a little easier to wrap my head around
[11:02:35] <caciavar> duch_kazatel There are pre-built functions that i'm using like this: DDK.scorecard2.reload("scorecard01");
[11:02:42] <caciavar> duch_kazatel for example
[11:02:42] <duch_kazatel> ph1 jquery isn't a language.
[11:02:57] <ph1> javascript my bad
[11:03:39] <caciavar> duch_kazatel: $('#roll-select').change(function() {DDK.scorecard2.reload("scorecard01");}); is an example
[11:03:42] <duch_kazatel> ph1 either way, that doesn't change my point - you're not really learning much.  you're doing a lot of copy/paste.
[11:04:00] <duch_kazatel> caciavar i have no idea what DDK.scorecard2.reload("scorecard01"); does.
[11:04:05] <caciavar> that will reload a scorecard into a div called "scorecard01"
[11:04:06] <duch_kazatel> caciavar could we start over from the beginning?
[11:04:18] <caciavar> duch_kazatel sure
[11:04:20] <duch_kazatel> "reload a scorecard" doesn't mean anything to me.  how does it do that?  ajax?
[11:04:27] <ph1> duch_kazatel, unfortunately time constraints, but some of it's filtering through in the process as well :)
[11:04:32] <caciavar> duch_kazatel yes, by ajax
[11:04:35] <duch_kazatel> caciavar http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[11:04:39] <duch_kazatel> maybe this will help?
[11:05:38] <duch_kazatel> ph1 not really sure how to help you at this point, either.  it sounds like you want us to write things for you so you can learn from it.
[11:09:55] <ph1> duch_kazatel, no not at all that is just a bi-product, I'm learning at the same time.. that for function and the one I gave you earlier might be basic to you but for someone with no experience it seems like magic, kind of like what you can do with regex in linux. it takes a number of years of working with it to understand the intricacies etc... you make something quite difficult seem easy.
[11:10:21] <duch_kazatel> ph1 you asked what $('select') does >.>
[11:10:51] <ph1> lol well yes but I was confusing it with sql :P
[11:11:11] <duch_kazatel> you were confusing jquery with SQL?
[11:11:42] <ph1> I was just trying to wrap my head around what it was all doing and where I could place it in my code.
[11:11:50] <ph1> yes :S
[11:11:53] <ph1> :P
[11:12:17] <duch_kazatel> $() is the jquery function - $('select') will select all select elements on the page.
[11:12:18] <ph1> <---- noob as I explained yesterday
[11:12:20] <Fenhl> duch_kazatel: what am I missing? http://jsfiddle.net/RkbYe/
[11:12:29] <duch_kazatel> just like $('a') will select all a elements on a page.
[11:12:52] <duch_kazatel> Fenhl <div id="#container"> - you want <div id="container">
[11:12:59] <Fenhl> whoops
[11:14:09] <ankurk_> ph1, you should start docs, most of things people will explain are already there.
[11:14:13] <ankurk_> *reading
[11:15:43] <ph1> duch_kazatel, ah ok, but the data is coming straight from a database, it doesn't exist in any select elements on the page. The script you help me put together yesterday is pulling the data from the DB and returning it in json format, and then we're needing to wrap it with option tags and put it into the relevant select elements. That's what your code is doing yeah?
[11:16:03] <Fenhl> duch_kazatel: the filter doesn't seem to work though http://jsfiddle.net/RkbYe/2/
[11:16:29] <ph1> duch_kazatel, in a nutshell that is...
[11:16:57] <duch_kazatel> ph1 today's code is taking an object, looping through its properties, and appending each item to a select.
[11:17:06] <duch_kazatel> you would need to do that within the .done() callback of your ajax.
[11:17:40] <duch_kazatel> Fenhl let me look.
[11:18:05] <duch_kazatel> Fenhl wait what are you trying to do?
[11:18:15] <ph1> duch_kazatel, ok cool thanks again and sorry for being so dense :P I am reading but there's a lot to read
[11:18:36] <duch_kazatel> ph1 it's not about being dense, it's about learning to use the resourced you have available.
[11:18:37] <Fenhl> duch_kazatel: delete everything except <a> elements and text
[11:20:36] <ph1> duch_kazatel, I know but it does take time still. Ok I'm gonna go cry now :P
[11:21:07] <duch_kazatel> Fenhl woops, should have been .prop('tagName')
[11:21:09] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/RkbYe/3/
[11:21:09] <Fenhl> duch_kazatel: the html is user-provided and I want them to be able to use a restricted subset (once I get the example to work I'll add more allowed elements and test for attributes)
[11:21:23] <duch_kazatel> Fenhl oh... you're doing validation?
[11:21:31] <duch_kazatel> you should probably get a library for that instead.
[11:22:22] <Fenhl> hm
[11:22:26] <duch_kazatel> or a plugin or something.
[11:23:48] <Fenhl> can you recommend something? all I can find is form validation
[11:24:00] <duch_kazatel> Fenhl could you explain what you're really trying to do?
[11:24:12] <duch_kazatel> step back and explain why you thing you need this?
[11:25:04] <Fenhl> duch_kazatel: the profile pages like http://dev.wurstmineberg.de/people/fenhl and http://dev.wurstmineberg.de/people/naturalismus etc have a description field
[11:25:26] <Fenhl> right now the js just throws the person's description in there as html
[11:26:43] <Fenhl> which is fine because we're only a few people who can usually be trusted with this sort of thing
[11:27:19] <Fenhl> today being April Fools, however, some people decided to have some fun with the exploitability of the description field
[11:28:19] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/1229594/923919
[11:28:22] <duch_kazatel> that's what you want, then.
[11:30:32] <Fenhl> duch_kazatel: how would that be relevant? afaict it takes HTML entities like &lt; and decodes them into the original characters like <
[11:31:19] <duch_kazatel> you can swap the two ;)
[11:32:25] <Fenhl> yes but I still want to allow a limited number of tags: <a href>, <em>, <s>, <span class="muted">
[11:32:51] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/a/11892228/923919
[11:44:21] <ph1> duch_kazatel, can I pm you?
[11:44:25] <duch_kazatel> please do not :)
[11:44:32] <ph1> lol ok
[11:44:38] <drej> can i pm you duch_kazatel ?
[11:44:52] <duch_kazatel> OF COURSE, YOU DIRTY BEAST
[11:44:54] <bberry> duch_kazatel: did you get my pm? <3 xoxo
[11:45:07] <duch_kazatel> <3
[11:45:14] <duch_kazatel> such happy.  so hug.
[11:45:14] <duch_kazatel> wow
[11:45:18] <bberry> lol
[11:45:22] <drej> such pm, much asl
[11:45:24] <duch_kazatel> many love
[11:46:17] <ph1> can you tell me if this is on the right path http://jsfiddle.net/mightymouse2045/LW36m/3/
[11:48:21] <duch_kazatel> yeah, - if (response.content) { what is this supposed to be?
[11:48:26] <duch_kazatel> checking if it exists?
[11:49:26] <ph1> i don't need that in there?
[11:49:50] <duch_kazatel> you can leave it in - just asking why you have it there.
[11:50:19] <duch_kazatel> might make more sense to compare to undefined
[11:50:29] <ph1> that's what you gave me yesterday :S
[11:50:42] <duch_kazatel> that's one way to do it.
[11:50:51] <visua> Could someone perhaps recommend a good ajax modal that can go 100%/100%
[11:50:55] <ph1> and I'm just trying to plugin the function you gave me today
[11:51:12] <duch_kazatel> ph1 this is why youi need to learn basics instead.
[11:51:50] <Crippy> can jquery use the same CSS3 property transition to support older browsers?
[11:52:03] <Crippy> if I select the relevant elements
[11:52:29] <ph1> I really would just like to get this working - it's like just one step to finish it off :S
[11:52:51] <BillCriswell> visua: What does ajax have to do with the modal?
[11:55:49] <duch_kazatel> why do people do that?  "help, i don't know what i'm doing.  it's easy it's like one more step to get it done."
[11:56:32] <ph1> well it kind of is in this case :P lol
[11:56:56] <ph1> and then I'm gonna go read all the jquery books i can find
[11:57:52] <duch_kazatel> the jquery api documentation is fantastic.
[11:58:08] <ph1> I'm reading that debug page you sent earlier
[11:58:13] <duch_kazatel> good :)
[11:58:13] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: They're the ones I ignore immediately.
[11:58:46] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i'm slowly getting there.
[11:58:51] <duch_kazatel> the help vampires.
[11:59:03] <BillCriswell> "It's easy for someone who knows what they're doing."
[11:59:11] <BillCriswell> Well... how would you know that?
[11:59:24] <duch_kazatel> haha did you see the Red Lines video i sent out earlier?
[11:59:34] <BillCriswell> I did not.
[11:59:36] <duch_kazatel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg
[11:59:52] <FullContactCoder> http://projects.catlab.eu/leonidas/ the sound on/off button is there in Chrome but not in Firefox. Anyone have any idea? I toggle it with Jquery
[12:01:45] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: lol
[12:01:49] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell :)
[12:02:55] <BillCriswell> I feel this guys pain so much.
[12:10:47] <guy> is it possible to prefix $.fn plugin? ie. instead of having $.fnGajusKlaus, to have $.fn.gajus.klaus
[12:10:53] <jcool> duch_kazatel: I was working something same as ph1. I followed the code that you gave and went through that.
[12:10:56] <guy> I am not able to access this that way
[12:12:06] <jcool> duch_kazatel: I am able to get each part of it. the response is coming. we are calling append function. append function is wrapping that code for provinces.
[12:12:10] <duch_kazatel> guy you have to create the first object and then add the second as a property to it.
[12:12:47] <jcool> duch_kazatel: I am worried the drop down still doesnt gets filled with elements that came as response.
[12:12:55] <guy> well, that's what I am doing already, afaik. $.fn.gajus = $.fn.gajus || {}; $.fn.gajus.klaus = function () {};
[12:13:02] <guy> or do you mean something else?
[12:13:27] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ guy
[12:13:27] <b-ot> guy: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:13:34] <duch_kazatel> jcool okay?
[12:14:17] <jcool> duch_kazatel: I mean code looks good to me. if it is success we are calling append function. we are passing the json response and desintation and telling that function to set values on that.
[12:14:36] <jcool> duch_kazatel: that is what I thought.
[12:14:50] <duch_kazatel> jcool okay?
[12:14:57] <jcool> duch_kazatel: okay.
[12:14:58] <duch_kazatel> jcool not sure what the question is.
[12:15:24] <guy> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/H3AsN/
[12:15:32] <jcool> duch_kazatel: okay. the question is I am not able to figure out why the json response that we are recieveing is not being set on destination element.
[12:15:55] <duch_kazatel> jcool i'd have to see it in action. are you sure the success is getting called?  are you getting any console errors?
[12:16:26] <duch_kazatel> guy i mean, theoretically that works.
[12:16:29] <jcool> duch_kazatel: I can show you the json response I get when  I change my country dropdown.
[12:16:32] <duch_kazatel> what about it doesn't work?
[12:16:41] <ankurk_> For the love of God, I don't get why my boss asked me to do a *list* using duvs
[12:16:43] <ankurk_> *divs
[12:16:55] <guy> duch_kazatel: How do I get reference of the $('#foo')
[12:16:59] <duch_kazatel> jcool tno console errors?
[12:17:06] <jcool> duch_kazatel: no console errors.
[12:17:07] <duch_kazatel> guy from where?
[12:17:16] <duch_kazatel> jcool share the code then?
[12:17:17] <guy> from within the klaus function
[12:17:23] <guy> it is in the comments.
[12:17:45] <jcool> duch_kazatel: it;s same as ph1.http://jsfiddle.net/mightymouse2045/LW36m/3/
[12:17:52] <jcool> duch_kazatel: I will show you output too.
[12:17:57] <duch_kazatel> guy you're trying to chain.
[12:18:35] <duch_kazatel> jcool appendData expects a string for destination, not a jquery object.
[12:18:39] <guy> duch_kazatel: .. ?
[12:18:50] <jcool> duch_kazatel: http://awesomescreenshot.com/0812l1pc0c
[12:19:01] <duch_kazatel> guy think about it. $('#foo').gajus.klaus(123);
[12:19:08] <duch_kazatel> jcool all ready answered you buddy :)
[12:19:17] <jcool> duch_kazatel: yeah ;)
[12:19:17] <duch_kazatel> guy you can't chain like that.
[12:19:25] <duch_kazatel> guy why are you trying to do this anyway?>
[12:19:40] <guy> You haven't even read the original question, haven't you?
[12:19:58] <duch_kazatel> guy "is it possible to prefix $.fn plugin? ie. instead of having $.fnGajusKlaus, to have $.fn.gajus.klaus"
[12:20:12] <guy> That answers your question.
[12:20:25] <duch_kazatel> why are you trying to do that?
[12:20:38] <guy> "why" is a lose-end question.
[12:20:54] <naomi> $.fn.foo = {}; $.fn.foo.bar = function() { console.log(this); }; $("div").foo.bar();
[12:20:59] <duch_kazatel> no, it's not.  maybe you're trying to do something that is better accomnplished through other needs.
[12:21:03] <duch_kazatel> *means
[12:21:27] <guy> duch_kazatel: purely style thing. I don't like prefix appearing as part of the fn name.
[12:21:46] <duch_kazatel> "prefix" isn't a thing.  properies and object are.
[12:21:50] <duch_kazatel> *objects.
[12:22:11] <duch_kazatel> you could write your function and then set whatever you want to that function.
[12:22:29] <guy> "klaus" is library name. "gajus" is vendor prefix. $.fn.gajusKlaus merger the two together. I'd like klaus to become property of gajus.
[12:23:01] <stock584_> Hello all!  Trying to tackle a problem and curious if anyone wants to chime in.  I am a bit new to jQuery so will try my best to explain.  I have a JSON response that I am currently populating a dropdown box with (ex: Item A, Item B, Item C).  If a user selects any Item from the drop down box, I want to then populate fields of a form (on the same page) from the JSON response (i.e. User selects Item B, populate form with all information pertaining to I
[12:23:01] <stock584_> tem B in the JSON response).  Could anyone point me in the general direction where I could read a bit more on this?
[12:23:03] <guy> anyway, I will just go for using $.gajus.klaus and force passing the container selector as an option
[12:23:23] <duch_kazatel> so you'd like $.fn.gajusKlaus to reference $.fn.Klaus.gajus ?
[12:23:51] <guy> what. How did you get to that..?
[12:24:05] <guy> Anyway. I am done.
[12:24:07] <guy> Thank you
[12:24:18] <naomi> lol
[12:24:19] <naomi> ragequit
[12:24:24] <naomi> "stop helping me!"
[12:24:29] <duch_kazatel> an oftn member no less...
[12:24:31] <duch_kazatel> jesus
[12:24:47] <duch_kazatel> stock584_ which part of that are you stuck on?
[12:25:11] <NoiseEee> hey, my daughters name is naomi
[12:25:25] <duch_kazatel> stock584_ because it's pretty basic - call $.ajax(), and within the .done() callback do your stuff with the data.
[12:26:21] <naomi> NoiseEee: we've actually chatted before
[12:26:30] <naomi> NoiseEee: it would've been a long time ago
[12:26:31] <duch_kazatel> stock584_ please do not PM me
[12:26:46] <NoiseEee> naomi: hmm crazy
[12:26:51] <naomi> I remember your nick though
[12:26:57] <duch_kazatel> stock584_ please ask your question here.
[12:27:46] <stock584_> duch_kazatel sorry about that
[12:27:58] <duch_kazatel> amd mpw o
[12:28:03] <duch_kazatel> err, now I'm off to lunch.
[12:28:41] <stock584_> so i can populate a form field, but it will include the json from all three objects not the one selected in the drop down box
[12:32:52] <NoiseEee> stock584_: why? why aren;t you just returning the JSON for the one selected?
[12:34:44] <stock584_> NoiseEee so the user will put in their API key click a connect button that will start the JSON request, once that request is returned it then fills out a drop down box of a field out of the JSON request (Item title - Item A, Item B, Item C)
[12:34:45] <felixjet> why this doesn't work? append('<span class="edit">foo</span>');
[12:34:53] <felixjet> class="edit" is not appearing
[12:35:56] <stock584_> so once the user sees all of their items listed they will select the appropriate one they want to work on -- at this point I want to make it easier for the user by once they select the drop down it then will get the other data from the JSON request to populate the form fields
[12:36:20] <stock584_> sorry grammar is a bit off there! :-)
[12:36:43] <NoiseEee> stock584_: so somewhere you haev to index what is what then.  ie: {"itemA":['someThing','somethingElse'],"itemB":['otherOption','yetAnother']}    etc
[12:37:07] <NoiseEee> felixjet: show it not working in a fiddle
[12:40:08] <stock584_> NoiseEee thank you for your help! will read a bit more about indexing
[12:40:15] <stock584_> appreciate it!
[12:40:18] <felixjet> in fiddle works
[12:40:25] <NoiseEee> stock584_: just more about objects and keys
[12:40:25] <felixjet> but in my case dont :/
[12:40:36] <NoiseEee> felixjet: what errors are in your console?
[12:40:39] <felixjet> nvm
[12:43:24] <felixjet> it was a mistake from me
[12:44:30] <williamtdr> Hello, my head's about to explode because of how my code is working right now ;)
[12:44:39] <williamtdr> So I have an ajax result.
[12:44:50] <williamtdr> In theory, I'd be able to refer to a value like this:
[12:44:57] <williamtdr> result.SG_wins_today
[12:45:04] <williamtdr> But that returns undefined.
[12:45:14] <williamtdr> But the weird thing is if I run this on the result:
[12:45:19] <williamtdr> $.each(result, function(index, value) {
[12:45:29] <williamtdr> and then have it log out the indexes and the values.
[12:45:40] <williamtdr> the value is there just fine.
[12:45:53] <HiMaX> hello, i cannot find answer on how to make a checkbox checked on page load using jQuery. example <input type="checkbox" name="address" value="paul"/>
[12:46:09] <williamtdr> Is there some other kind of operator I'm supposed to use to refer to the results inside the ajax (array?object?)
[12:46:17] <williamtdr> Thanks in advance.
[12:46:45] <ankurk_> HiMax: give this an id first (if it is unique), then use .prop()
[12:47:44] <HiMaX> ankurk_ : i want to use value="" from input
[12:47:55] <Brycetron> duch_kazatel
[12:47:57] <Brycetron> You there?
[12:48:11] <HiMaX> i mean value="" as identifier
[12:48:18] <ankurk_> HiMaX: you just want your checkbox checked on page load right?
[12:48:31] <Brycetron> I started coding 1 1/2 months ago
[12:48:34] <HiMaX> ankurk_: yes
[12:48:36] <Brycetron> anyone want to inspect my site please
[12:48:43] <Brycetron> I just made the site today
[12:48:46] <ankurk_> then .prop and giving an id should work
[12:48:47] <Brycetron> So it's obviously that good
[12:49:06] <ankurk_> HiMaX: if you have more issues, make a fiddle
[12:50:05] <HiMaX> ankurk_: do i have to supply a unique ID for each checkbox input ?
[12:52:01] <raphael> HI.. could someone help me?
[12:52:11] <raphael> I'm using jquery mobile
[12:52:29] <HiMaX> ankurk_ : something like this ? <input id="paul" type="checkbox" name="address" value="paul"/>
[12:52:31] <raphael> for some reason, I don't know why.. when I call $.mobile.changePage("#chamados", {reverse: false, changeHash: false});
[12:52:47] <raphael> I change the page, and after takes back!
[12:53:20] <ankurk_> HiMaX: yes
[12:53:29] <ankurk_> and remember id has to be unique
[12:53:48] <Brycetron> ankurk will you check out my site
[12:53:51] <Brycetron> i made it today
[12:53:54] <Brycetron> i'm a newbie
[12:54:06] <Brycetron> I'd appreciate it..
[12:54:12] <ankurk_> Link?
[12:54:13] <HiMaX> ankurk_ : okay thanks
[12:54:17] <Brycetron> may i PM you please?
[12:54:55] <raphael> anyone?
[12:55:05] <snardbafulators> what is this compile error in my terminal mean?
[12:55:07] <snardbafulators> http://imgur.com/feq03xk
[12:55:09] <snardbafulators> any idea?
[12:55:18] <ankurk_> I don't like being PMed actually, I am at work
[12:57:21] <Brycetron> www.michaelmconahan.co.nf
[12:57:24] <Brycetron> what do you think ankurk
[12:57:28] <Brycetron> or anyone else
[12:59:02] <snardbafulators> http://imgur.com/feq03xk
[12:59:04] <snardbafulators> ?
[12:59:11] <snardbafulators> any ideas?
[12:59:55] <ankurk_> Brycetron: jQuery is not a language
[13:03:01] <CrowX-> the following tweenmax code is supposed to animate the change in 1 second, but instead it's doing it instantly. Why? http://pastebin.com/tNwXgr98
[13:04:16] <Brycetron> Thanks ankurk lol
[13:04:22] <Brycetron> What should i put jquery under instead of languages?
[13:04:35] <Brycetron> Should i just put it in brackets around the javascript (jquery)?
[13:07:49] <ankurk_> jQuery is a library
[13:10:03] <raphael> is there a way to stop pagecreate on jquery mobile? using jquery routes? or something like that?
[13:11:04] <BillCriswell> "Geometry".
[13:13:12] <Brycetron> Thanks akurk.
[13:13:55] <raphael> ???
[13:16:50] <rindolf> Hi all.
[13:25:00] <t_user> CrowX-, animations are set in milliseconds
[13:25:13] <t_user> you're animating it over 1ms
[13:25:15] <t_user> try 1000 :>
[13:27:08] <b1nd> If I have a script in the middle of the page that relays on a script on the bottom of the page.  Would simply putting the middle script inside a document ready allow it to 100% of the time access the script at the bottom of the page?
[13:27:08] <CrowX-> t_user, do you have experience with tweenmax?
[13:27:19] <b1nd> would jQuery document.ready slove this issue?
[13:27:48] <t_user> crowX-, nope :(
[13:27:53] <rindolf> b1nd: hmmm...
[13:28:20] <rindolf> b1nd: why do the need to be ordered like that?
[13:28:26] <t_user> b1nd yep, it would!
[13:28:39] <b1nd> because some html gets injected into some shell page
[13:29:25] <b1nd> okay, so it will work 100% of the time?
[13:29:27] <t_user> sometimes injecting scripts via <script> tags somewhere other than the footer makes sense, especially in some kind of MVC-architecture
[13:29:41] <b1nd> since at bottom of page there is <script> tag that I need in the stuff that inside the middle of the page
[13:29:47] <t_user> b1nd yeah, im pretty sure! document.ready is supposed to run when the whole document has been loaded (that includes scripts)
[13:30:21] <b1nd> okay it works 90% of the time I think but not 100% this could be true?
[13:30:32] <t_user> but! remember, to use $(), jQuery has to be loaded.. so you might have to put jQuery in the head, but you can keep the others at bottom
[13:30:58] <b1nd> yes jQ is in head
[13:31:14] <b1nd> and other <script> are at bottom
[13:31:23] <b1nd> and in middle I have $(function() {
[13:31:41] <t_user> hmm.. weird that it doesnt work all the time
[13:31:57] <b1nd> okay but it should?
[13:32:04] <b1nd> as far as you understand as well, right?
[13:32:32] <t_user> yeah, it should. maybe there's some other dependencies inside your scripts? doing any ajax-requests?
[13:32:53] <b1nd> yes I am doing some $.getScripts inside as well
[13:33:25] <t_user> i've had problems in the past with ajax loading at different speeds.. you can't really count on ajax requests to arrive in the same order as you requested them
[13:33:27] <b1nd> but if I use them functions, only after success calls $.getScript('',function()
[13:33:53] <b1nd> yes i am not expecting ajax request to arrive at same order i know it change
[13:33:58] <b1nd> that is why i have success functions
[13:34:55] <NoiseEee> b1nd: it sounds like you're "doing things wrong", no offense
[13:35:18] <NoiseEee> for one, *why* is there <script> in the middle of your page? for what purpose?
[13:35:18] <b1nd> no
[13:35:28] <b1nd> u need read up before speak
[13:35:29] <b1nd> thanks
[13:35:34] <NoiseEee> lol good luck dude
[13:36:26] <duch_kazatel> back
[13:36:57] <duch_kazatel> what's going on?
[13:37:55] <t_user> b1nd, i think the problem lies somewhere inside your getScript success-functions
[13:38:30] <t_user> did you fetch the script error when it crashed btw?
[13:44:23] <Fernandos> hi
[13:46:05] <Fernandos> I'm not sure what parameter the requestFullscreen() function requires.. could you give me a hint on why the code in the onComplete() callback type-errors
[13:46:19] <Fernandos> here's the snippet: http://bpaste.net/show/BRnLMNZSqe32PfaU6ncQ/
[13:48:53] <Fernandos> here's an example that works http://johndyer.name/lab/fullscreenapi/
[13:50:40] <duch_kazatel> "could you give me a hint on why the code in the onComplete() callback type-errors" - could you give us a specific error example?
[13:55:37] <Fernandos> sure
[13:57:04] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: I'll make a jsbin example, but the error I'm getting is >> TypeError: a[(this.prefix + "RequestFullScreen")] is not a function
[14:00:26] <cjwelborn> Fernandos: so what type is el[this.prefix + 'RequestFullScreen']() ..maybe you aren't getting what you think you're getting.
[14:05:03] <Fernandos> cjwelborn: I think el[this.prefix + 'RequestFullScreen'] tries to make native fullscreenAPI requests crossbrowser compatible as shown in line 11 http://bpaste.net/show/BRnLMNZSqe32PfaU6ncQ/
[14:11:02] <ionas> Helloes
[14:12:00] <ionas> so I have quite some experience with LAMP, HTML, SQL, CSS etc‚Ä¶ I never liked JavaScript too much (it confuses me especially the debugging) ‚Ä¶ so lately I still got more into it, XHR and JSON - now my code base pollutes more and more
[14:12:10] <ionas> what are good concepts of organizing jquery code
[14:12:45] <ionas> there are some plugin configurations, some listeners to events, some dom element building, some timers (jquery.timer plugin) and some XHR calls, even nested ones
[14:13:07] <naomi> ionas, keep your code really flat and it will be fine
[14:13:27] <ionas> naomi: flat - e.g. not too nested?
[14:13:33] <naomi> ionas: yes
[14:13:51] <ionas> so you recommend creating functions to be called instead o nesting $.ajax()?
[14:13:59] <naomi> ionas: apart from that, i can't really give you much advice without seeing your actual code
[14:14:16] <duch_kazatel> abstract out common things to functions and call those instead.
[14:14:20] <naomi> ionas aboslutely. also look into the promises interface jquery lets you use with ajax stuff
[14:14:24] <duch_kazatel> keep javascript in .js files.
[14:14:35] <ionas> duch_kazatel: I do :)
[14:14:37] <naomi> ionas: another good thing would be to look at other people's code to see how they do things
[14:14:57] <ionas> naomi: well I only find libraries online
[14:15:03] <ionas> I am looking for something like MVC
[14:15:08] <ionas> or HMVC
[14:15:13] <ionas> or something else
[14:15:44] <ionas> to be honest, despite me moving from pure CSS to LESS things still pollute too fast
[14:15:46] <duch_kazatel> you want backbone or riot.
[14:15:59] <duch_kazatel> can you give an example of "pollute"?
[14:16:29] <naomi> ionas: yeah, backbone.js is (in my opinion) just enough structure
[14:16:34] <naomi> i don't like large frameworks anymore
[14:16:39] <duch_kazatel> brb
[14:17:17] <Fernandos> cjwelborn: ok. here is the minimal example http://jsbin.com/cuyenuxe/6/edit
[14:17:26] <ionas> these are two javascript files
[14:17:31] <ionas> I sure do a lot of things inefficient
[14:17:32] <Fernandos> it shows the same error as I encounter here
[14:17:32] <ionas> http://pastebin.com/UKjxTc87
[14:17:54] <ionas> hm
[14:18:25] <ionas> maybe I should split up the code into multiple js files, use an assetcompress/assetcompresser and only load those js files required by some views
[14:18:41] <ionas> but there could be collisions then
[14:18:51] <ionas> e.g. the same js file being loaded twice into assetcompress
[14:20:04] <naomi> ionas: whoa, yeah
[14:20:13] <ionas> naomi: :E
[14:20:16] <naomi> ionas: also, not everything needs to happen in document.ready
[14:20:21] <cjwelborn> Fernandos: Works in Chrome, what are you using?
[14:20:38] <Fernandos> cjwelborn: oh really? hmm... I'm on firefox
[14:20:41] <naomi> ionas: tons fo these functions can simply be defined on their own
[14:20:46] <Fernandos> version 28
[14:20:51] <ionas> naomi: yeah probably
[14:21:25] <cjwelborn> Fernandos: that compatibility thing, somewhere el[this.prefix + 'RequestFullScreen'] is not being set in Firefox.
[14:21:30] <naomi> ionas: and don't prefix your vars with $ unless they are jquery results
[14:21:38] <cjwelborn> Fernandos: sorry, i'm not more help. But maybe that will help you pin it down.
[14:22:03] <ionas> naomi: okay
[14:22:41] <naomi> ionas: are these custom functions or something? $.ionasGetParamFromUrl
[14:22:41] <Fernandos> cjwelborn: hmm I also tried in chrome, but no fullscreen there too
[14:22:45] <naomi> $.ionasStripQueryStringAndHashFromPath ?
[14:23:01] <naomi> why "ionas" prefix ?
[14:23:10] <ionas> naomi: prohibiting possible name clashes
[14:23:53] <Fernandos> ionas: good code means, finding balance between cohesion and abstraction.
[14:23:54] <duch_kazatel> ionas learn about and use closures/IIFEs.
[14:23:59] <ionas> is there a better way to insert DOM elements than to do html text?
[14:24:13] <duch_kazatel> ionas jquery has an .append() method.
[14:24:34] <duch_kazatel> ionas but don't prefix things with random words just because.  create objects and attach methods to those instead.
[14:25:00] <ionas> duch_kazatel: yeah that‚Äôd be better
[14:25:46] <ionas> brb
[14:28:21] <Fernandos> ionas: yes a) batching b) FSM (finite state machine) c) virtual dom and diffing d) FRP (functional reactive programming)
[14:28:34] <cjwelborn> Fernandos: When i run your JSBin I get a 'wiki' article that goes 'fullscreen' (actually fills the output-window/browser-pane), and the only errors I see are 'missing semi-colon'. I'm on Kubuntu, Chrome 33.0.1750.152  ..so i don't know. (screenshot of final result: http://imgur.com/fiM0qfV )
[14:29:55] <Fernandos> cjwelborn: ahh yeah you mean that. That is not fullscreen, but only filling the browser. I mean "real fullscreen", like when you press F11 on your browser.
[14:30:37] <Fernandos> I tried to get it to show in "native fullscreen"
[14:30:42] <ionas> Fernandos:  hmmm‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs all that ;p
[14:30:46] <Fernandos> ionas: Maximum cohesion means sphagetti code and is only acceptable if the code is generated. See tcp remy http://web.mit.edu/remy/ But maximum abstraction is almost always unneccessary, except when you write a framework
[14:31:07] <ionas> Fernandos: I‚Äôd like to stop careing about live vs non-live - any good way to do that?
[14:31:28] <Fernandos> ionas: ehrm.. just my answer to "is there a better way to insert DOM elements than to do html text?"
[14:31:38] <duch_kazatel> ionas what do you mean?
[14:31:46] <duch_kazatel> "live vs. non-live"
[14:32:14] <ionas> duch_kazatel: I am inserting elements from time to time and I need to update my jquery-dom-selectors/event listeners then
[14:32:15] <Fernandos> ionas: yeah, use nodejs and gulp (it's the modern version of grunt, which is the javascript version of makefiles)
[14:32:27] <duch_kazatel> ionas use .on(), not live.
[14:32:31] <duch_kazatel> and learn about event delegation.
[14:32:32] <ionas> duch_kazatel: yes I do
[14:32:55] <ionas> and there is no way to do things ‚Äúalways live‚Äù - is it too bad for performance?
[14:33:06] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:33:14] <duch_kazatel> "always live" is not a thing.
[14:33:25] <Fernandos> ionas: it will concatenate, compress, uglify (compress), tune (jscrush) and more automatically and can upload stuff to your dev->staging->production environent
[14:33:26] <duch_kazatel> you mean you don't want to worry about when you attach handlers?
[14:33:47] <ionas> duch_kazatel: yes
[14:34:07] <ionas> if you now say, that can be done but it is bad cause of performance, ‚Äî oka
[14:34:17] <Fernandos> ionas: funny, all I currently write gets auto compressed, packed and uploaded, but to my staging environment =) it's a small project anyways =)
[14:34:34] <ionas> Fernandos: I don‚Äôt get you ;-P?
[14:34:44] <duch_kazatel> ionas don't attach listeners unless you need them.
[14:35:06] <duch_kazatel> and don't attach a metric buttload or whatever.\
[14:35:10] <duch_kazatel> bind what you need.
[14:35:14] <ionas> currently I have a mix of pre-loaded DOM and ajax updates
[14:35:21] <duch_kazatel> yep.  sounds like a web page.
[14:35:31] <Fernandos> ionas: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_environment_(software_development_process)
[14:35:33] <duch_kazatel> bind your ajax contents listeners to the parent containers
[14:35:48] <ionas> so your recommendation is to fetch everything by json and and attach when required?
[14:35:53] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:36:00] <ionas> duch_kazatel: yeah I read about that
[14:36:25] <ionas> Fernandos: I don‚Äôt know what you are trying to tell me ;-)
[14:36:38] <duch_kazatel> ionas they're shotgunning out all kinds of info for you.
[14:36:58] <ionas> duch_kazatel: you mean parent containers that are pre-loaded/static?
[14:36:59] <ionas> yes
[14:37:27] <Fernandos> Always live makes sense, when your IDE is a "cloud-ide" and you mean testing/dev or staging environment, or when you work on a very small project.
[14:37:59] <ionas> you do drive me crazy Fernandos  :p
[14:37:59] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: you're totally right, hahhaa *shotgun unloaded*
[14:38:10] <CrowX-> Does anyone here have experience with TweenMax/TweenLite?
[14:38:16] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ CrowX-
[14:38:16] <b-ot> CrowX-: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:39:14] <Fernandos> CrowX-: not used it, but a client of mine swears on it, apparently he was/is a flash enthusiast, that may explain it.
[14:39:27] <ionas> naomi: I think the first thing I will be doing is seperating my huge javascript files into smaller bits and package them in modules, still everything global and within dom Ready‚Ä¶ then I will sort out what belongs into ready and what does not
[14:39:36] <ionas> duch_kazatel: thanks as well
[14:39:51] <duch_kazatel> ionas anything that doesn't rely on loaded content can be before dom ready.
[14:40:18] <ionas> duch_kazatel: all the element listeners do require the dom to be loaded, don‚Äôt they?
[14:40:29] <ionas> $('#system_messages_box').on('hover', '.message', function() { // in ready
[14:40:38] <ionas> $.ionasStripQueryStringAndHashFromPath = function(url) { // not in ready
[14:40:43] <Fernandos> ionas: this may be of interest http://www.infoq.com/articles/modular-javascript
[14:40:59] <ionas> Fernandos: now that sounds right
[14:41:02] <ionas> *takes a look*
[14:41:22] <CrowX-> Ok, I have a div with height set to 0px by default, and I have a TweenMax.to statement that should increase its height to 'auto' in the course of 1 second. It does increase the height to 'auto', but it's instantly, not animated in one second.
[14:41:27] <duch_kazatel> ionas yes.  also: $.ionasStripQueryStringAndHashFromPath - don't name things that way.
[14:41:43] <CrowX-> any idea what could cause this? here's my line: TweenMax.to($(current).parent(), 1, {height:'auto',delay:3});
[14:41:43] <ionas> duch_kazatel: yeah someone already told me to create a class for that
[14:41:48] <ionas> or rather an object in js
[14:41:49] <duch_kazatel> object.
[14:41:50] <duch_kazatel> not class.
[14:41:52] <t_user> CrowX- swap the "1" to "1000"
[14:41:53] <t_user> try again
[14:41:53] <ionas> yeah yeah
[14:41:55] <ionas> ;-)
[14:42:00] <CrowX-> t_user, TweenMax takes seconds
[14:42:07] <t_user> you sure?
[14:42:10] <ionas> duch_kazatel: as I said, javascript makes me run in circles ;-)
[14:42:15] <t_user> i mean, you've tried to no result? :D
[14:42:24] <CrowX-> t_user, it works fine when I resize the image from 'auto' to '0px' :)
[14:42:26] <t_user> it looks like it's using jQuery, and jQuery uses ms
[14:42:29] <CrowX-> but not the other way around
[14:42:32] <t_user> ah ok
[14:42:33] <duch_kazatel> even when javascript gets the class keyword, there will be no classes - that's just going to be syntactic sugar for constructors.
[14:43:11] <ionas> duch_kazatel: there are only instantiated objects, yes?
[14:43:16] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[14:43:22] <t_user> my guess is that "auto" is the problem.. And the only reason it works FROM "auto" to 0px, is that it takes currentHeight -- animate --> 0
[14:43:27] <ionas> instantiated classes only, objects only
[14:43:29] <t_user> while the other way around.. doesnt work
[14:43:55] <t_user> try to calculate what the "auto" height by yourself, and at the end of the animation set the css to "auto"
[14:44:14] <duch_kazatel> ionas you can do class-like instantiation, sure.  but you don't have to.
[14:44:20] <t_user> what i mean is: do it manually. but at the end, if you really need height: auto, you do that manually too
[14:44:21] * ionas bows to Fernandos for stopping to fool around with him ‚Ä¶ and reads some infoq - not sure if I will do testing but maybe the rest is still worth it
[14:44:28] <naomi> ionas, i will be back a little later, but here's just a little example of how i would structure some of these things differently: https://gist.github.com/naomik/9923776
[14:44:38] <ionas> naomi: tahnks
[14:45:50] <ionas> naomi: hmm I wonder about what you are doing there in terms of JS
[14:46:04] <naomi> ionas: what do you mean?
[14:46:18] <ionas> document ready usually takes a closure
[14:46:30] <naomi> ionas: document ready takes a function
[14:46:31] <ionas> and you supply it with a function name
[14:46:33] <Fernandos> ionas:  please stand up, you're welcome! =) you asked good questions and I tried to give you the breadcrumbs (although maybe too many) to the things you will have use for in the future. This is the dom-diffing approach for example: http://facebook.github.io/react/
[14:46:48] <duch_kazatel> ionas a closure is the function that closes over another.
[14:47:01] <duch_kazatel> the "parent", not the "child"
[14:47:03] <naomi> ionas: ditch your understanding of "closures", it's probably wrong
[14:47:09] <ionas> naomi: probably
[14:47:10] <naomi> ionas: javascript has functions. that's it
[14:47:19] <Kamuela> does jquery provide methods to draw divs?
[14:47:19] <duch_kazatel> naomi javascript has closures, too ;)
[14:47:24] <naomi> a function can be named, or it can be part of an expression, or it can be both
[14:47:29] <ionas> so anonymous functions?
[14:47:32] <duch_kazatel> it can also close over another function.
[14:48:02] <ionas> naomi: so it does not make a difference if I say foo : function() {} or function foo() {}?
[14:48:15] <ionas> or foo = function() {}
[14:48:15] <naomi> you mean foo = in the first example
[14:48:20] <naomi> and yes, there is a difference
[14:48:21] <ionas> yeah sorry
[14:48:26] <Kamuela> ionas: The only difference is function foo() will fail if you try to pin it to a variable with a different name
[14:48:35] <ionas> foo : function would probably assign to the hash key
[14:48:39] <naomi> function foo() {}; is the same as: var foo; foo = function foo() {};
[14:48:49] <naomi> note, in this example, foo.name // "foo"
[14:49:03] <ionas> I don‚Äôt get it ;-)
[14:49:05] <duch_kazatel> Kamuela you can also use the function declared in function foo(){} before the declaration.
[14:49:11] <ionas> I mean, I don‚Äôt get why :p
[14:49:23] <Fernandos> I think http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript explains some of that.. crazy much information there
[14:49:31] <naomi> ionas: the "name" portion of a function appears after the word "function"
[14:49:45] <ionas> var foo; // local variable
[14:49:45] <ionas> foo = function foo() {} // local variable foo holds a pointer to foo()
[14:50:13] <ionas> and foo = function() {}¬†// here foo is global?
[14:50:19] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:50:36] <erming> I've just released a new jquery plugin: http://erming.github.io/jquery-scroll-glue/. Any feedback and tips for new features are appreciated
[14:50:44] <duch_kazatel> one is a reference to an anonymous function.  the other is a reference to a named function.
[14:50:47] <ionas> so what‚Äôs the difference then? between function foo() {} and foo = function() {}
[14:50:57] <naomi> your first is a "named function"
[14:50:58] <ionas> ah ok
[14:51:00] <ionas> yeah
[14:51:03] <naomi> the second is a function expression (with assignment)
[14:51:05] <duch_kazatel> in practice, the first one can be used before you declare it.
[14:51:06] <naomi> you can do
[14:51:14] <naomi> var foo = function bar() {}; foo();
[14:51:24] <naomi> bar(); // reference error undefined "bar"
[14:51:30] <naomi> foo.name; // "bar"
[14:52:13] <naomi> ionas: are you familiar with teh concept of "hoisting" in javascript ?
[14:52:21] <ionas> you mean hosting? no
[14:52:34] <naomi> ionas, no. "hoisting"
[14:52:49] <naomi> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Scope_Cheatsheet#Hoisting
[14:53:09] <naomi> ionas: what's important to know is that function foo() {}; is just a shortcut for
[14:53:14] <naomi> var foo; foo = function foo() {};
[14:53:24] <naomi> except that it "hoists" the "var foo;" part to the top of the scope
[14:53:44] <ionas> so var foo; will be at the top of the scope
[14:53:49] <naomi> yes
[14:53:51] <ionas> Ah I get it
[14:53:57] <ionas> it is declared but not defined.
[14:54:01] <naomi> correct.
[14:54:08] <naomi> that way you can even do things like
[14:54:16] <ionas> in the case of function foo() {}
[14:54:17] <naomi> function foo() { foo(); } // recursion
[14:54:20] <sadtaco> Don't have to be in sequence
[14:54:30] <naomi> the only way the inner portion of that scope works is because you technically have:
[14:54:36] <ionas> in the case of foo = function() {} it is not declared until the line is executed you could say
[14:54:38] <naomi> var foo; foo = function foo() { foo(); }
[14:54:46] <naomi> ionas: exactly
[14:54:59] <ionas> naomi: twists your mind really
[14:55:00] <ionas> ;p
[14:55:20] <ionas> if you don‚Äôt work with encapsulation it can really break up things
[14:55:44] <ionas> thats another thing, my apps really like to choke on javascript so I have to be very careful to not introduce errors
[14:55:56] <ionas> as long as it is only easy catchable runtime stuff, I can manage
[14:56:02] <naomi> ionas: well now that you're using named functions, it will help tremendously
[14:56:07] <ionas> any way to make error reporting and catching etc better?
[14:56:17] <naomi> because your stacktrace will say things like "blah error in myFunc"
[14:56:22] <ionas> naomi: okay
[14:56:24] <naomi> instead of "blah error in <Anonymous>"
[14:56:28] <ionas> yes
[14:56:38] <naomi> much much easier to find the problems this way
[14:56:38] <ionas> so the ‚Äúold‚Äù way of creating functions is just fine?
[14:56:47] <naomi> it's not old, it's just different
[14:56:50] <naomi> you can do inline named functions too
[14:57:01] <ionas> well you could do function foo() in livescript already ;p
[14:57:06] <naomi> $("a").click(function onClick(event) { ... });
[14:57:15] <ionas> I am not so sure about foo = function() { alert(‚Äòhi‚Äô) } in livescript ;-)
[14:57:23] <naomi> i have no idea what livescript is
[14:57:24] <ionas> my guess is, ‚Ä¶ no :p
[14:57:31] <ionas> the predecessor to javascript :)
[14:57:35] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:57:36] <naomi> an ALWAYS make sure to use your var keyword
[14:57:49] <duch_kazatel> livescript is not te predeccesor to javascript.
[14:57:54] <naomi> i don't ever want to see you writing "foo = function() {}" unless there is a "var foo" above it somewhere
[14:58:39] <ionas> released 1995 as livescript
[14:58:40] <ionas> afaik
[14:58:48] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:58:59] <duch_kazatel> livescript was released in 2011.
[14:59:03] <duch_kazatel> what are you talking about?
[14:59:07] <ionas> that‚Äôs another livescript ;-)
[14:59:28] <duch_kazatel> oooh, you mean the old name for javascript.
[14:59:46] <ionas> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Eich#Career
[14:59:50] <naomi> yeah there's a new livescript now too
[14:59:51] <naomi> http://livescript.net/
[14:59:52] <ionas> duch_kazatel: indeed :)
[14:59:54] <ionas> yes
[14:59:54] <duch_kazatel> that wasn't a predecessor, that was the old name of it.
[15:00:02] <naomi> ionas: here's a little plugin i'm working on: http://jsfiddle.net/naomi/hRzp6/
[15:00:11] <jphase> anyone know off-hand if the value of a file input (after a file is attached) is always preceded with C:\fakepath\ on every browser/OS so I don't have to open up browserstack?
[15:00:21] <naomi> it's very basic, but you can kind of see how i keep a very flat code throughout
[15:00:50] <naomi> anyway, going to the store now
[15:00:51] <naomi> bbl
[15:00:52] <ionas> naomi: thank you, yes it is, I can understand all of it ;-)
[15:01:22] <ionas> so I should prefix everything with var unless I need things to be ‚Äúglobal"
[15:01:32] <ionas> what does global mean, really global or just global down from there?
[15:01:41] <duch_kazatel> ionas you should rarely have anything global.
[15:01:43] <duch_kazatel> always prepend with var.
[15:01:47] <ionas> duch_kazatel: okay
[15:01:51] <duch_kazatel> scope to functions.
[15:03:10] <ionas> duch_kazatel: you mean var does scope to the function level?
[15:03:32] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[15:03:38] <duch_kazatel> you should learn about scope.
[15:03:49] <ionas> yes I should
[15:03:53] <__joshua__> !scope
[15:03:53] <b-ot> __joshua__: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope
[15:04:02] <duch_kazatel> was just about to go find that.,
[15:05:05] <ionas> are all these statements pulled to the top (hoisted)? ‚Äúvar mycar‚Äù
[15:07:26] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:08:26] <duch_kazatel> what statements?
[15:11:07] <ionas> var mycar = { brand : honda }
[15:11:07] <duch_kazatel> i'm cooking up a fiddle to demonstrate.
[15:11:07] <ionas> alert(dateNow()) ; sleep(100); var something = { date : dateNow() };
[15:11:07] <ionas> whats something.date holding
[15:11:07] <ionas> the dateNow() of the script start or the one of the variable assigment
[15:11:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/JGsm8/
[15:11:14] <ionas> as far as I understood it now, something is defined at script start but only assigned later on
[15:11:39] <duch_kazatel> something.date would hold the result of dateNow()
[15:12:04] <ionas> okay, so there is one way to say a variable is global from within a function by omitting var?
[15:12:24] <ionas> duch_kazatel: yeah but given dateNow() returns the exact date at the moment of execution
[15:12:41] <ionas> lets say it is timestamp() for better understanding
[15:13:06] <duch_kazatel> ionas omitting var to hoist that declaration is not technically valid.
[15:13:25] <ionas> duch_kazatel: I wasn‚Äôt about hosting at the moment ;-)
[15:13:27] <duch_kazatel> most javascript engines allow it to be more forgiving, but it's still not valid.
[15:13:28] <ionas> and I dont understand
[15:13:32] <duch_kazatel> hoist
[15:13:33] <duch_kazatel> not nost
[15:13:34] <ionas> yeah
[15:13:44] <ionas> hoisting
[15:13:45] <ionas> sorry
[15:13:48] <Rou> Javascript is for noobs
[15:14:07] <duch_kazatel> ionas so don't omit var ever.
[15:14:23] <ionas> duch_kazatel: got that but I wanted to have one thing confirmed
[15:14:42] <ionas> var foo = ‚Äòbar‚Äô; // is declared at the script start but assigned only when the line is executed (again)?
[15:14:49] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:15:28] <ionas> alert(1000); sleep(1000); var foo = timestamp(); alert(timestamp) // should be two different timestamps
[15:15:34] <ionas> nvm
[15:15:45] <ionas> basically, never omit var, okay
[15:16:26] <ionas> and for clarity I can write var = functionname; functionname = function() {}? or is that bad?
[15:16:44] <duch_kazatel> do var functionName = function() {}.
[15:16:54] <duch_kazatel> or function aFunction(){}
[15:17:47] <ionas> okay
[15:17:57] <ionas> I like var functionName = function() {}
[15:18:05] <ionas> so to get back to the technical details a last time
[15:18:26] <ionas> if I have a global delcaration, it does not get hoisted (though this is bad practise)?
[15:18:39] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:18:51] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1013385/what-is-the-difference-between-a-function-expression-vs-declaration-in-javascriphttp://stackoverflow.com/a/13481152/923919
[15:18:53] <ionas> ‚Äúionas omitting var to hoist that declaration is not technically valid.‚Äù - i don‚Äôt understand
[15:18:56] <duch_kazatel> read that.
[15:19:50] <ionas> maybe function expressions are much more to what I know that closures are like then
[15:20:04] <duch_kazatel> stop using that word :)
[15:20:16] <ionas> ;-p
[15:20:27] <ionas> what else? proc?
[15:20:46] <ionas> anonymous functions only executed at run time not declaration time ;p
[15:21:13] <duch_kazatel> a closure is a function that closes over another function.
[15:22:30] <duch_kazatel> you're still confused.
[15:25:56] <ionas> yeah about your nitpicking on closures ,-)
[15:26:03] <ionas> you are probably right
[15:26:14] <ionas> doesn‚Äôt mean I understand
[15:26:32] <duch_kazatel> it's not nitpicking - it's an important thing.  same with "anonymous functions only executed at run time not declaration time ;p"
[15:26:39] <duch_kazatel> not sure where you got that idea.
[15:26:39] <ionas> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope#Nested_functions_and_closures - I do get the chapter named ‚ÄúNested functions and closures"
[15:28:51] <ionas> duch_kazatel: var bar = function() { timestamp() }; // only get‚Äôs executed at runtime
[15:29:03] <ionas> whatever
[15:29:36] <ionas> I can only understand basic ruby, php syntax and very limited javascript
[15:29:48] <ionas> well ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù
[15:29:54] <ionas> maybe other code as well, but not really
[15:31:09] <ionas> they are lazy evaluated
[15:31:20] <ionas> that‚Äôs what I mean by executed at run time not declaration
[15:32:06] <ionas> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions_and_function_scope#Nested_functions_and_closures shows a different kind of closure though, simply nested functions
[15:32:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/JGsm8/3/
[15:32:33] <duch_kazatel> that's executed whenever its called.
[15:33:22] <ionas> yeah the setTimeout thing is also a closure, isn‚Äôt it?
[15:33:24] <ionas> yes
[15:33:24] <duch_kazatel> a closure is a function that "closes over" another.
[15:33:38] <duch_kazatel> no.  the function that calls foo is a closure.
[15:33:43] <ionas> so what‚Äôs the closure - the inner function, the outer function or both?
[15:33:44] <duch_kazatel> settimeout calls a function.
[15:34:08] <ionas> ah so I mostly mixed up the caller and the callee - maybe all time and since forever
[15:34:28] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/Y5E2e/
[15:34:41] <ionas> yeah, I got that now
[15:34:52] <ionas> I thought the inner one was the closure, but obvisouly by the name, the outer is
[15:35:49] <vetCh_> hi, my autocomplete suggestion list gives me my json string "character by character". i.e. if i type 'e', it's suggestions will be (separated by comma): [, {, ", l, a, b, e, l, :, e, n,      and so on. Can anyone please tell me what i should do?
[15:35:51] <ionas> so in all these cases, the outer function is the closure
[15:35:51] <ionas> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_%28computer_programming%29#Closure_leaving
[15:36:31] <duch_kazatel> i'm just talking about javascript - i don't know about other languages.
[15:36:40] <kyan> Hi, I'm running into trouble with animations with this project http://futuramerlin.com/d/r/active.php?wint=1&wintNeeded=ember_dev In Google Chrome, the inner picture wanders around the screen. In firefox, everything kind of blows up, although it eventually gets to the expected final state. Any thoughts on what I'm messing up? Thanks :)
[15:36:51] <ionas> vetCh_: maybe you use join() and omit join(‚Äò‚Äô)
[15:37:14] <ionas> duch_kazatel: okay :)
[15:37:21] <ionas> duch_kazatel: still I learned a lot and thank you very much
[15:37:26] <duch_kazatel> vetCh_ can you share in a jsfiddle?
[15:37:39] <naomi> ionas, i second that, you do _not_ need globals
[15:37:55] <vetCh_> ok, waito
[15:38:17] <ionas> I will then refactor my code to be modular, load on per requirement of-off my web-app-framework (let‚Äôs see how good I can do that) and encapsulate stuff in objects and move them out like this https://gist.github.com/naomik/9923776
[15:38:49] <duch_kazatel> cool
[15:39:15] <naomi> ionas: after that exercise, i would encourage you to spend a couple hours looking at something like backbone
[15:39:27] <ionas> maybe I will simply split things in groups and think about assetcompress/assetcompile to reduce the loaded javascript
[15:40:12] <vetCh_> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/Z7h8h/
[15:40:31] <naomi> ionas: you might want to look into node-browserify and uglifyjs for compiling your javascript assets
[15:41:06] <naomi> ionas: browserify will bundle heaps of files together into a single "bundled" file
[15:41:12] <ionas> duch_kazatel: I saw you updated http://jsfiddle.net/JGsm8/ - I already got the scoping from the mozilla developer link above - was pretty logical and well, I used it that way already, but didn‚Äôt know - though for setTimeout I think I had some variable binding/scope issues, but don‚Äôt remember
[15:41:16] <duch_kazatel> vetCh_ and what does the returned data look like?
[15:41:22] <naomi> ionas: i don't use RequireJS, AMD, Bower, or any of that stuff
[15:41:29] <ionas> naomi: I am using AssetCompress of my MVC Framework
[15:41:44] <ionas> whatever that is ^^
[15:41:44] <duch_kazatel> ionas don't use setTimeout in general.  i used it there to illustrate a point.
[15:42:02] <ionas> duch_kazatel: hm setInterval is really nice to pull ajax updates?
[15:42:07] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[15:42:12] <ionas> how do you do it then?
[15:42:14] <duch_kazatel> you should pull updates on an event.
[15:42:16] <duch_kazatel> like a click.
[15:42:20] <__joshua__> what
[15:42:25] <__joshua__> setInterval is fine
[15:42:38] <naomi> setInterval is not fine
[15:42:39] <duch_kazatel> i personally avoid it unless i really need to do timed updates of things.
[15:42:41] <naomi> not for polling
[15:42:41] <__joshua__> need to poll a server on a regular basis?  setInterval
[15:42:45] <ionas> duch_kazatel: hehe, I have an app where users move around 64x64 tiles in a grid
[15:42:51] <naomi> joshtau: i disagree
[15:42:52] <ionas> if some other user moves those around, it needs updating
[15:42:58] <vetCh_> duch_kazatel, something like this from server: [{"label":"description","value":"1"},{"label":"another description","value":"14"}],
[15:42:59] <naomi> __joshua__: i disagree*
[15:43:21] <naomi> __joshua__: i think that polling should happen on a timeout after the successful response from the previous request
[15:43:24] <ionas> so I poll the server with a very small request and response, if the response is fresh : false - I send another XHR request requesting new data
[15:43:41] <ionas> naomi: good concept
[15:43:44] <__joshua__> naomi: fair enough.  actually how i do it too
[15:43:45] <duch_kazatel> ionas are you doing any checking to see if the previous one successfully completed?
[15:44:03] <__joshua__> don't poll again until last poll suceeded/failed
[15:44:04] <ionas> duch_kazatel: I use jquery timer to pause and resume
[15:44:07] <duch_kazatel> vetCh_ you mihgt need to stringify first.
[15:44:22] <ionas> duch_kazatel: I don‚ÄôT know about jquery.timer‚Äôs internals though
[15:44:33] <ionas> I assumed it uses setInterval cause I swapped that out - I needed pause and play
[15:45:18] <__joshua__> something like var update = function(){} return $.get(/asdfs).always(function(){ setTimeout(update, intervaltime - timetaken);});
[15:45:28] <ionas> naomi: I will consider doing that though, using setTimeout and do the next poll on ajax complete (either error or success)
[15:45:58] <Kamuela> i love jquery, such a beautiful library. i'm using it more and more and realizing how eloquent it is
[15:46:16] <__joshua__> if only he didn't screw up promises....
[15:46:48] <duch_kazatel> who?
[15:47:31] <sdwrage> Hey guys. I am trying to use the SelectBoxIt plugin but getting this when I try to load it: Uncaught TypeError: Object function ( selector, context ) {
[15:47:43] <ionas> __joshua__: hm is always() the same as complete : {¬†} ?
[15:47:46] <ionas> or similar to
[15:47:58] <__joshua__> same as .then(f, f);
[15:48:02] <sdwrage> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/882578adca9b89a3980c
[15:48:09] <sdwrage> that is the plugin unmagnified
[15:48:16] <sdwrage> any reason why it would throw that error?
[15:48:26] <duch_kazatel> sdwrage could you supply your code?
[15:48:29] <duch_kazatel> maybe in a fiddle?
[15:48:46] <sdwrage> this is in a rails app so that may take me time to move over.
[15:48:54] <sdwrage> let me try a bare bones
[15:48:57] <sdwrage> and see if it works in fiddle
[15:49:22] <ionas> __joshua__: well I have nested ajax calls and I think I will keep the idea to pause/resume a timer
[15:49:40] <ionas> hmmm
[15:49:44] <ionas> I will think about it
[15:49:45] <__joshua__> kk, ionas, but that will get messy
[15:49:49] <__joshua__> real messy
[15:49:55] <ionas> it will?
[15:50:10] <vetCh_> duch_kazatel, I addedd JSON.stringify(data), but to no difference
[15:50:29] <ionas> for instance when I drag and drop elements I pause the timer
[15:50:29] <__joshua__> will introduce some anoying lag if your timeouts are long too
[15:50:31] <duch_kazatel> vetCh_ also, make sure you're accessing a string and not an object.
[15:51:25] <__joshua__> hmmm ioans: that acutally makes sense, you will have to deal with poll -> local state change -> poll result -> mismatch
[15:51:28] <ionas> I am using this one https://github.com/jchavannes/jquery-timer/blob/master/jquery.timer.js
[15:51:37] <vetCh_> duch_kazatel, well, I am sending the success function of ajax to response() of autocomplete, it is a string, right?
[15:51:56] <duch_kazatel> vetCh_ not necessarily.
[15:52:10] <ionas> __joshua__: there is always the possibility of a data mismatch - even if polling continues
[15:52:21] <ionas> as the poll window is maybe 200ms (very much server strain)
[15:52:22] <naomi> ionas: here's a generic Poll class, https://gist.github.com/naomik/fce8d228011d0c152502
[15:52:29] <naomi> ionas: it's untested, but the concept is probably useful
[15:52:39] <__joshua__> well, read state at request time, and merge user state with poll result
[15:53:02] <Fernandos> do you know a jquery plugin for just the native fullscreenAPI?
[15:53:13] <ionas> I like how you implemented the default delay naomi :)
[15:53:16] <ionas> elegant
[15:53:26] <Fernandos> this is the only one I found http://johndyer.name/native-fullscreen-javascript-api-plus-jquery-plugin/
[15:53:34] <ionas> I‚Äôd have typed delay = 500 in the function definition (not sure if javascript can do it ;p)
[15:53:55] <ionas> but as I said, I need to pause polling for some actions
[15:53:59] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos i'm pretty sure that's the one i'm using.
[15:54:02] <duch_kazatel> brb
[15:54:49] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: can you please tell me, how you use it, if you're back? For me it somehow doesn't work..
[15:55:44] <macscam1> anybody know why i am getting
[15:55:55] <macscam1> "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ; " in regards to line 56 here: https://gist.github.com/MaxPleaner/9924738
[15:56:04] <ionas> @Fernandos that looks nice too, cause I am doing game stuff and fullscreen is ncie for that
[15:56:30] <kyan> Bingo, found a library called Transit that fits the bill. Sorry for the noise! :)
[15:56:34] <vetCh_> duch_kazate_, ahan, but then JSON.stringify should change it to string if needed, shouldn't it
[15:56:46] <Fernandos> kyan: what does it do?
[15:56:54] <ionas> macscam1: did you close $.each()?
[15:57:20] <naomi> ionas: here's a couple tweaks to show how to add public api: https://gist.github.com/naomik/fce8d228011d0c152502
[15:57:53] <naomi> ionas: usage.js becomes _dead_ simple
[15:57:55] <ionas> naomi: thanks, I think I will take that and work on it
[15:57:56] <Fernandos> macscam1: just run jshint dude, or hit the jshint button here http://jsfiddle.net/grksG/
[15:58:00] <naomi> ionas: and really  clean, too
[15:58:01] <ionas> usage.js?
[15:58:06] <naomi> ionas: the second file in the gist
[15:58:13] <ionas> ah yes
[15:58:14] <ionas> :)
[15:58:14] <ionas> <3
[15:58:17] <naomi> ^.^
[15:58:35] <naomi> this is how you do encapsulation with js :)
[15:58:38] <sdwrage> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/6582F/
[15:58:43] <sdwrage> there is my jsfiddle
[15:59:07] <ionas> naomi: yeah that‚Äôs not too hard but I am used to a framework giving me a frame
[15:59:17] <ionas> yeah backbone.js
[15:59:19] <ionas> maybe
[15:59:38] <naomi> bbl all
[16:01:05] <ionas> see you around - 1am :-)
[16:01:38] <CrowX-> if I have "var1 = $("#div1")" and "var2=$("#div2")"  how do I swap the elements var1 and var2 are pointing to?
[16:02:12] <duch_kazatel> back
[16:02:43] <ionas> I will have to think more about organisation in general though
[16:02:49] <ionas> my css/less files are too much spread as well
[16:02:54] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- b = [a, a = b][0];
[16:02:59] <CrowX-> i.e. is "var1 = $("#div2")" and "var2 = $(#div1)" going to work?
[16:03:14] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- you can redeclare just fine.
[16:03:29] <kyan> Fernandos: It provides an equivalent to animate for CSS transforms
[16:03:49] <ionas> duch_kazatel: laughing out loud that variable swap is nasty :p
[16:03:55] <ionas> the one using arrays :p
[16:03:56] <kyan> Which solved my problem by letting me use CSS's scale instead of zoom
[16:03:57] <duch_kazatel> it works :)
[16:04:00] <ionas> haha
[16:04:00] <Fernandos> kyan: ah
[16:04:01] <ionas> its funny
[16:04:23] <duch_kazatel> understanding why it works is even better.
[16:04:53] <kyan> Although it seems smoother animation in Chrome, it seems hitchier in Firefox, so I can't vouch for its performance
[16:05:08] <ionas> duch_kazatel: sadly still not faster than c = a,  b = a, a = c - my guess
[16:05:20] <duch_kazatel> ionas that won't work ;)
[16:05:24] <ionas> duch_kazatel: no?
[16:05:28] <ionas> did I do something wrong ;p
[16:05:40] <ionas> oh yes I did haha
[16:05:41] <duch_kazatel> fiddle it and see ;)
[16:05:45] <ionas> *facepalm*
[16:05:55] <ionas> maybe I should do it like above - but not all languages support that ;p
[16:06:02] <sdwrage> duch_kazatel, http://jsfiddle.net/6582F/
[16:06:11] <sdwrage> for the selectboxit issue
[16:06:30] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: how did you use the fullscreen plugin?
[16:06:42] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos by calling it.
[16:06:52] <ionas> duch_kazatel: at least I understood what you did there :-)
[16:06:56] <duch_kazatel> sdwrage i'm getting "$(...).selectBoxIt is not a function"
[16:07:06] <sdwrage> yeah. look at the error
[16:07:10] <ionas> not understanding the internals about how arrays/arrayish objects work
[16:07:14] <Fernandos> haha :D I mean what parameter did you pass to the function? Seems to require an ID to a div container or something..
[16:07:18] <sdwrage> Uncaught TypeError: Object function ( selector, context ) {
[16:07:24] <sdwrage> you will see that error pop back up
[16:07:29] <duch_kazatel> sdwrage that's not the error you want to correct.
[16:08:01] <sdwrage> duch_kazatel, well if the jquery plugin is erroring out, wouldnt the call to selectboxit not work?
[16:08:18] <duch_kazatel> sdwrage it doesn't work.  that's the problem.
[16:08:19] <ionas> I have to get some sleep
[16:08:20] <ionas> see you around
[16:08:20] <duch_kazatel> a.widget is not a function
[16:08:48] <sdwrage> duch_kazatel, is it an issue with the plugins code?
[16:08:54] <sdwrage> not my plugin btw :P
[16:09:16] <duch_kazatel> it probably isn't.
[16:09:21] <sdwrage> :\
[16:09:22] <sdwrage> yay
[16:09:40] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/6582F/1/
[16:09:46] <duch_kazatel> you don't have jquery ui installed
[16:10:06] <duch_kazatel> http://gregfranko.com/jquery.selectBoxIt.js/#Requirements
[16:10:13] <duch_kazatel> you need jquery AND the jquery ui widget factory.
[16:11:12] <sdwrage> hrm. I have both in my rails app
[16:11:20] <sdwrage> I have jquery and Jquery UI included
[16:11:47] <duch_kazatel> dunno what to tell you.
[16:12:34] <sdwrage> hem wait
[16:12:40] <sdwrage> I may have forgot to add that
[16:12:54] <sdwrage> duch_kazatel, thanks for help. let me see what happens after I add the jquery ui lines in
[16:13:11] <duch_kazatel> ok.
[16:13:43] <sdwrage> duch_kazatel, yep... my bad. Thanks for pointing me towards the problem
[16:13:47] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[16:13:59] <sdwrage> I thought I included jquery.ui but it was jquery ujs or something like that
[16:14:01] <sdwrage> x.x
[16:25:11] <ionas> sdwrage: I can only recommend chosen
[16:25:31] <sdwrage> ionas, ??
[16:25:37] <ionas> as a select box replacement
[16:26:00] <ionas> http://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/
[16:26:08] <duch_kazatel> meh, use whatever you want.  replacing select boxes is funky business.
[16:26:15] <duch_kazatel> or hand roll if you want to be cool.
[16:26:17] <sdwrage> ooo thats nice too
[16:26:26] <sdwrage> duch_kazatel, eh... no thanks XD
[16:26:46] <ionas> duch_kazatel: well I am kind of a newbie in the js world (not really but then really, I avoided JS whenever possible)
[16:26:58] <ionas> (also cause I am convinced for regular content pages it is a bad thing ;p)
[16:27:17] <ionas> and well chosen was really easy to setup and use
[16:27:37] <ionas> and it works well with something like Rails cause the belongsTo field is made searchable
[16:27:40] <ionas> by chosen
[16:28:13] <duch_kazatel> ionas not using js when reasonable is a good thing - what does that have to do with suggesting another plugin?
[16:28:14] <ionas> you can set the displayField/label of the belongsTo assoication to include some more data (virtualField or however it is done in recent rails) and search the association with autocomplete etc
[16:28:55] <ionas> duch_kazatel: I am weak at JS, he uses rails (I did too, but now using something similar) and it looks like he wants a select box replacement and the one I found worked very well despite that I am weak on JS
[16:29:05] <duch_kazatel> okay.
[16:29:19] <ionas> so sorry, I didn‚Äôt want to say ‚Äúthis is better‚Äù - wasn‚Äôt meant that way
[16:29:21] <duch_kazatel> i was only pointing out that select box replacement is a funky concept.
[16:29:24] <ionas> no offense
[16:29:27] <ionas> I do agree
[16:29:32] <duch_kazatel> i wouldn't take any offense.
[16:29:39] <ionas> I‚Äôd not replace any widgets if possible.
[16:30:11] <ionas> the reason I do replace the select boxes is to make them searchable. many people don‚Äôt know that the browser supports type-ahead in select boxes
[16:30:19] <ionas> but that‚Äôs not the same like autocomplete/match still
[16:30:31] <duch_kazatel> "many people don‚Äôt know that the browser supports type-ahead in select boxes" wut
[16:30:46] <ionas> yes they dont
[16:30:47] <ionas> :)
[16:31:05] <ionas> like clicking on the month select and typing ‚Äúja‚Äù and hitting enter - no
[16:31:06] <duch_kazatel> you can implement it just fine.  just sure what you're getting at there.
[16:31:44] <ionas> duch_kazatel: I‚Äôd only do it unobstrusivly and maybe if it is a big app limit the clients that load the select box replacement
[16:31:46] <ionas> anyway
[16:31:46] <duch_kazatel> oh, you mean the string match that you can do on those controls by selecting and typing.
[16:31:51] <ionas> yes
[16:31:58] <ionas> many don‚Äôt know
[16:32:02] <duch_kazatel> i'm aware.
[16:32:22] <ionas> I mean many don‚Äôt know that for good apps you can click on the labels checkboxes to hit the checkboxes ;-)
[16:32:24] <duch_kazatel> munging a dropdown and a search box is generally not a good idea imo.  not unless you have a fantastic reason for it.
[16:32:27] <ionas> if the app is done right
[16:32:37] <duch_kazatel> that's becoming better known.
[16:32:40] <ionas> duch_kazatel: the reason is ActiveRecord
[16:32:58] <duch_kazatel> wut? that's a rails thing isn't it?
[16:33:03] <ionas> well not precisely
[16:33:04] <ionas> but yes
[16:33:43] <duch_kazatel> you're not making very much sense.
[16:33:53] <ionas> it is a design pattern
[16:33:56] <ionas> utilized by rails
[16:34:03] <jim_j> hi
[16:34:18] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't enable things like labels activating checkboxes though. that has nothing to do with the backend really.
[16:34:36] <ionas> by rails, cakephp, symphony / doctrine, codeigniter, laravel,
[16:34:42] <ionas> duch_kazatel: nono, that has nothing to do with it
[16:34:51] <ionas> duch_kazatel: the select boxes are used to link associated models
[16:34:55] <ionas> usually
[16:35:03] <jim_j> I have a 'jQuery.ajax' call and all my submits are going into the error: function but the thrownerror is blank, what can I do to debug?
[16:35:06] <duch_kazatel> still not following.
[16:35:15] <ionas> if you have tons of associations in a select box (e.g. it is huge, a long list) you like to search through it
[16:35:40] <duch_kazatel> ionas you're confusing the concept of UX with implementation details i think.
[16:35:48] <duch_kazatel> jim_j look in the console.
[16:36:07] <ionas> duch_kazatel: I know what you mean, but in practise it is simply great to use chosen and be done with it for rapid prototyping
[16:36:10] <duch_kazatel> look for the net panel and go from there.
[16:36:26] <ionas> and in practise you work on other things that work worse than chosen
[16:36:35] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:36:51] <duch_kazatel> ionas i avoid using large dropdowns in general. if I need typeahead, I use our in-house typeahead solution.
[16:37:29] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, console shows no error as well
[16:37:30] <duch_kazatel> but we tend to avoid UX that requires a dropdown with typeahead like functionalkity.
[16:37:41] <ionas> duch_kazatel: and the reason for that is?
[16:37:44] <duch_kazatel> jim_j you should have a network or requests panel of some kind.  do you see it?
[16:37:59] <ionas> I found it to be very efficient
[16:38:02] <ionas> UX wise
[16:38:17] <ionas> and a general appraoch that works in many cases when prototyping
[16:38:21] <duch_kazatel> ionas because our design patterns don't require it.  we're a fairly major ecommerce company, so there's really no time we'd do something like that.
[16:38:54] <ionas> duch_kazatel: still can‚Äôt see the argument - but if your design guidelines don‚Äôt allow it, okay
[16:38:56] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, so in Firebug I should go to Net?
[16:39:22] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, I'm looking in console on Firebug, but nothing there
[16:39:25] <duch_kazatel> ionas it's not about our design guidelines, it's about our current patterns and industry.  where would I use something like that.
[16:39:34] <duch_kazatel> jim_j go to the net panel
[16:39:50] <jim_j> ok
[16:39:53] <ionas> duch_kazatel: you mean it is not used in general in customer interfaces?
[16:40:10] <duch_kazatel> ionas no.
[16:40:16] <ionas> which‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt imply it is bad in terms of UX :P
[16:40:21] <ionas> but I see your point
[16:40:50] <duch_kazatel> ionas i'm saying that, in general, a typeahead on a dropdown might not necessaryily be the best approach.  you're munging two separate web controls into one.
[16:41:06] <duch_kazatel> if you have dropdowns that big, you might have other issues.
[16:41:07] <duch_kazatel> that's all.
[16:41:15] <ionas> duch_kazatel: that‚Äôs right :)
[16:41:25] <duch_kazatel> jim_j you should see the failed request in there.
[16:42:25] <jim_j> checking
[16:43:34] <ionas> duch_kazatel: for me it is a question of efficiency also, sure I could come up with an UI that is best for each specific use, but that will require time, manpower, code, or I can use selects, have a list of key->value and the value is searchable or findable by scrolling - chosen also does filtering not only autocomplete so it works quite well - at least for prototyping - and where required, you are right, better solutions are always there :)
[16:43:46] <ionas> but for most things it is sufficient here
[16:44:02] <duch_kazatel> ionas i'm sure.
[16:44:09] <ionas> it also does multiselect much nicer than the plain old select multiple
[16:44:15] <duch_kazatel> it also depends on the audience.
[16:44:22] <ionas> for HasAndBelongsToMany (another active record thing)
[16:44:24] <ionas> yes it does, heavily
[16:45:00] <ionas> I am using chosen for admin panels and for a hobby gaming app - not for consumers using ecommerce applications
[16:45:14] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[16:46:04] <ionas> but even there, either you do for instance an address select like amazon (i don‚Äôt like it despite that they are big) or you can have a customer who selects their address in a chosen dropdown where they can scroll through a few addresses and even search for specific terms
[16:46:15] <ionas> but yes, having radioboxes and multiple addressblocks, is better.
[16:46:26] <ionas> despite ‚Ä¶ slower :(
[16:46:27] <duch_kazatel> your idea is very poor UX for a wide variety of reasons.
[16:46:41] <ionas> well, I am used to keyboards :p
[16:46:48] <duch_kazatel> you are not the average consumer.
[16:46:50] <ionas> yeah
[16:47:00] <ionas> that‚Äôs what I was implying there.
[16:47:10] <duch_kazatel> you need them to be very aware of what they're choosing for, say, their billing or shipping address.
[16:47:23] <ionas> yeah
[16:47:56] <ionas> well the UX I do for consumers is usually very clear and easy to use, but for admin panels I try to make things efficient if you have to repeat tasks
[16:48:22] <duch_kazatel> "admin panels" are still very dependent on the audience.
[16:48:26] <ionas> anyway, I will keep an eye open ;-)
[16:48:40] <ionas> yes ;-)
[16:48:56] <ionas> but after using things like Magento, chosen is dead simple ;p
[16:49:12] <duch_kazatel> magento and chosen are completely different things.
[16:49:25] <ionas> don‚Äôt be too logical, there, okay ;-)
[16:49:33] <duch_kazatel> huh?]
[16:49:38] <ionas> (you are)
[16:49:46] <duch_kazatel> you're comparing an ecommerce platform against a jquery plugin.
[16:50:00] <ionas> what was meant is: magento UX was terrible, where as the chosen widget never cause any troubles - there were complains but this wasn‚Äôt one
[16:50:19] <duch_kazatel> that's a really bizarre comparison to make, but OK.
[16:50:47] <ionas> yeah, but the chosen plugin encapsulates a lot of infromation, makes it selectable very fast for experienced users, but still working for newbies
[16:51:07] <ionas> whereas what I saw in big big company ecommerce apps like ebay, amazon or magento, things were not so upfront
[16:51:21] <duch_kazatel> lmao
[16:51:22] <ionas> so I‚Äôd not be too crazy about the ‚Äúbad UX‚Äù of a chosen with tons of data in it
[16:51:34] <duch_kazatel> now you're comparing magento against amazon.
[16:51:37] <duch_kazatel> please, keep going.
[16:52:08] <ionas> I think the audience is not too far off - both being rather non-technical audience
[16:52:16] <duch_kazatel> completely separate.
[16:52:26] <ionas> magento backend vs amazon checkout and account management
[16:52:32] <ionas> you think so?
[16:52:36] <duch_kazatel> very much so.
[16:52:41] <duch_kazatel> i know because we used magento for a few years.
[16:52:47] <ionas> the people using magento from day to day
[16:52:53] <ionas> not those developing extensions
[16:52:56] <duch_kazatel> serves a very different purpose than a more general-purpose platform.
[16:53:01] <duch_kazatel> we used the platform.
[16:53:06] <ionas> we did too
[16:53:16] <duch_kazatel> magento is meant for smaller, more specific categorial shops.  amazon is an "anything and everything" store.
[16:53:22] <ionas> so?
[16:53:23] <duch_kazatel> same with ebay.
[16:53:24] <ionas> I wasn‚Äôt about that
[16:53:34] <ionas> the user interfaces are bad :p
[16:53:59] <duch_kazatel> actually, amazon's UI and UX are pretty good.  same with ebay.  they're not necessarily pretty.
[16:54:01] <ionas> I prefer to browse ebay using some native app, not cause I do like native apps but because the UX is so bad
[16:54:04] <duch_kazatel> but that's because they're functional as all hell.
[16:54:44] <ionas> I don‚Äôt agree, they are neither beautiful nor supply a good experience, in deed though they are very powerful (at least the ebay one)
[16:55:31] <ionas> and I did compare because chosen is functional as hell for prototyping/activerecord apps
[16:55:49] <duch_kazatel> still not getting why you're making that comparison.
[16:55:50] <duch_kazatel> but ok.
[16:56:36] <ionas> cause I don‚Äôt see why having a dropdown + filter in one widget is bad when things like amazon and ebay work
[16:56:52] <ionas> yes, in many cases it is not the best solution
[16:57:12] <ionas> but in most cases it is a pretty good one and you need a lot of effort to bring up a better one, imho
[16:57:28] <duch_kazatel> because amazon and ebay understand a hell of a lot more about user interaction and experience on their platforms than you do?
[16:58:04] <ionas> would you apply that ‚Äúargument‚Äù to you as well?
[16:58:28] <duch_kazatel> you're building an extremely illogical argument at that point.
[16:58:40] <ionas> I can‚Äôt say, but I would not agree, at least I know that there is ton‚Äôs of stuff that could be done better, but the iterations and innovations are very very slow and the constraints probably high and lots of people involved
[16:58:44] <duch_kazatel> this started because you compared a jquery widget to magento.
[16:59:10] <duch_kazatel> ionas generally, the constraints are not high, depending on a variety of factors.
[16:59:13] <ionas> this started cause you said UX is bad on UX+dropdown
[16:59:38] <duch_kazatel> I said that if you're munging a dropdown with a search box, your UX likely needs to be revisited.
[16:59:46] <ionas> they are not, so why is it then that big competitors adapt slowly in terms of front end?
[17:00:10] <duch_kazatel> they don't.
[17:00:10] <ionas> duch_kazatel: yeah, it makes me suspicious too
[17:00:18] <jim_j> does anything pop up as wrong in my ajax function?  http://pastebin.com/eZ1taT9z
[17:00:49] <duch_kazatel> you don't notice it, but they run tons of a/b tests.  small stuff they drop into production that change all kinds of things.
[17:01:06] <ionas> duch_kazatel: yeah, let‚Äôs not fight about that ;-) my point is that they are slow big dinosaurs and all they improve on is backend, marketing, etc
[17:01:09] <duch_kazatel> jim_j the error wouldn't be hit unless the http request fails.
[17:01:11] <ionas> they might, and that‚Äôs good
[17:01:26] <duch_kazatel> ionas huh?
[17:01:30] <duch_kazatel> they do run a/b tests.
[17:01:33] <ionas> but there is little consistency, corporate identity, unified user interface, etc.
[17:01:43] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, the request to the_ajax_api.ajaxurl_api ?
[17:01:47] <ionas> yeah, I do believe that, and that‚Äôs good.
[17:02:08] <duch_kazatel> jim_j the request to that url is probably failing.
[17:03:31] <jim_j> hmm, thanks.  not sure why, maybe I need the action parameter
[17:03:48] <duch_kazatel> copy/paste that url into a browser window and watch what happens.
[17:04:45] <ionas> From a customer perspective I use those sites cause of prices, offers, content, not because of their retard looks and limited functionality (thatfor that they are giants) (though ebay‚Äôs product finder and filtering system is awesome).
[17:04:46] <ionas> Anyway, I really got to sleep, and I thank you for all the javascript lectures. I will consider finding other options than selects, but basically it looks like either it is a very few options and I can use radio/checkboxes or it is a lot of them and I am unsure on how to select references then
[17:04:56] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, ok
[17:06:48] <jim_j> duch_kazatel, I get '0' back
[17:06:51] <jphase> duch_kazatel: do you do much plugin coding? and if so, do you typically use strict or no?
[17:07:03] <jim_j> isn't that right?
[17:07:37] <duch_kazatel> jim_j if it's not throwing an http error code, then it looks like your ajax code might be wrong.
[17:07:49] <duch_kazatel> jphase i do a little, but no strict on my end.
[17:08:00] <jim_j> it's going to:  /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
[17:08:11] <duch_kazatel> jim_j and that url works?
[17:08:24] <jim_j> yes, but when I add: /wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=formapi I get the actual result from the php action function
[17:08:44] <jim_j> otherwise I just get '0'
[17:09:07] <duch_kazatel> what do you get back?
[17:09:11] <duch_kazatel> html?  json?
[17:09:30] <jim_j> I have have an                 echo "HELLO"; die;
[17:09:35] <jim_j> in the action function
[17:09:35] <duch_kazatel> maybe check to see that your data is working correctly.
[17:43:21] <Spami> Not really a query issue but any idea why this stop at half of the length: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a653411e3f5b9110efa9 ?
[17:45:18] <duch_kazatel> Spami the splice is screwing it up for you probably.  replace that first line with for (var i = 0, AllMarkerslength = AllMarkers.length; i < AllMarkerslength; i++ ) {
[17:45:57] <Velveeta> yeah, every iteration, you're incrementing i, and then chopping out the item at i index
[17:46:08] <Velveeta> that means you're actually skipping 1 index each time through the loop too
[17:46:43] <duch_kazatel> ooh, that means you'd need to build in a check to see if that happened and only iterate if it didn't.
[17:47:02] <Velveeta> also, your $.inArray is a wasted check, because if you're checking $.inArray(AllMarkers[i], AllMarkers), the value you're gonna get is i
[17:48:02] <duch_kazatel> Spami why are you removing things from the array?
[17:50:02] <Spami> duch_kazatel, basically it's a map, and all pins that are not in the view port anymore, I remove them
[17:50:27] <duch_kazatel> so you're checking each item in the array and removing it?
[17:50:41] <Spami> yes
[17:50:45] <Velveeta> i'm guessing that's what the .setMap(null) statement is for
[17:50:53] <Velveeta> but you don't need to splice them out of the array
[17:51:22] <Velveeta> you can just loop through the list and .setMap(null) on all of them, and then empty the list with something like AllMarkers = []
[17:51:34] <Spami> the .setMap(null) remove the map in the map and the splice remove the pin front he array
[17:51:56] <duch_kazatel> or use a different data structure to mark pins as inactive instead of removing them from an array.
[17:52:40] <Spami> Velveeta, not really because in some condition I have to keep the array and reuse it, so If I erase it I'll lost the pin I can remove it anymore
[17:53:26] <Velveeta> well in the snippet you posted, there's no case like that, you're iterating over the entire thing and removing the entire thing
[17:54:04] <Velveeta> but if you have to track only certain indexes for removal instead, you should log them to another array, and then iterate over that after your .setMap(null) loop has completed, and splice out the values from your AllMarkers array, in reverse
[18:38:35] <tfittsy> is there a way to track down what script is overriding the default behavior of a link?  It's basically doing a preventDefault, $.get(href) and replacing the page source with the results of the get, but I don't know where this is going on.
[18:48:02] <kongthap> hi, i have this script http://pastie.org/8987451 but when i press the button why the page is always reset so i lost the value in the input box
[18:50:14] <tfittsy> kongthap: function(e) { e.preventDefault(); ...
[18:50:58] <kongthap> tfittsy, where can i put the function :(
[18:51:09] <tfittsy> replace your functino() with function(e)
[18:51:22] <tfittsy> put e.preventDefault(); as the first line in your function
[18:51:55] <kongthap> from .click(function()) to .click(function(e) {e.preventDefault()); ... ?
[18:52:29] <tfittsy> http://pastie.org/8987457
[18:52:57] <kongthap> tfittsy, thanks :)
[18:53:15] <tfittsy> you're welcome
[18:58:27] <kongthap> is this correct? var txt_0_0 = $("input#elephant-blue"); .. var something = txt_0_0.val(); i got uncaught error :(
[18:59:29] <kongthap> because my previous coding using var something = $("input#elephant-blue").val(); was working
[19:03:59] <jphase> kongthap: those should be the same, and there's no need to use input#id since ids should be unique
[19:05:00] <BillCriswell> Damn, takana is awesome.
[19:05:00] <kongthap> jphase, i droped "input" from the selector but still error :(
[19:05:35] <BillCriswell> kongthap: There's something else going on on your code if that's not working.
[19:06:38] <jphase> kongthap: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/Y7hWK/
[19:06:43] <kongthap> BillCriswell, the error came from if txt_0_0.val() == "" {} is this illegal ?
[19:07:25] <BillCriswell> kongthap: if ( txt_0_0.val() == "" ) { } is.
[19:07:31] <BillCriswell> Without the ( ) isn't.
[19:07:58] <kongthap> jphase, thanks as BillCriswell said (i was so bad in javascript)
[19:08:15] <kongthap> BillCriswell, thanks
[19:08:23] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[19:09:35] <kongthap> can i have 2 dimention array for input such as <input type="text" value="2" name="pages_title[1][1]"> and later retrieve their value using jquery ?
[19:11:19] <BillCriswell> kongthap: Don't think so. You would need to access it by name.
[19:12:13] <kongthap> BillCriswell, would you recommend some technique for handle about 20 text input ?
[19:12:47] <BillCriswell> kongthap: You could get them all into an array of name value objects and use that list.
[19:12:51] <BillCriswell> What do you need to do with them?
[19:13:52] <BillCriswell> kongthap: You could do like var inputs = $('.some-form').serializeArray(); and it'll give you a list like [ { name: "name", value: "Bill" }, { name: "channel", value: "#jquery" } ]
[19:13:55] <kongthap> BillCriswell, in my case i have about 20 text input they are animal-color pair
[19:14:36] <kongthap> BillCriswell, i would get their value and put them into array then post to .php file
[19:15:21] <BillCriswell> kongthap: If you send the data to php it will be an array.
[19:15:35] <kongthap> BillCriswell, the php page expects something like this array("animal" => 0, "color" => 1, "value_from_input_text" => 10)
[19:15:57] <BillCriswell> $_POST['pages_title'][1][1] would return 2.
[19:17:01] <BillCriswell> kongthap: That would nee like <input name="animal" value="0">  <input name="animal" value="1"> <input name="value_from_input_text" value="10"> then $_POST would look like that.
[19:17:04] <kongthap> BillCriswell, my 1st input text is animal=>0, color=>0, the 2nd is animal=>1, color=>0 and so on (sorry too many requrement)
[19:17:20] <kongthap> the question is how should i name the text input ?
[19:17:55] <jim_j> I'm trying to do an ajax call and I'm getting a 200 response code back with 'Client closed connection before receiving entire response'
[19:18:42] <jim_j> anyone know what causes that?
[19:18:44] <kongthap> BillCriswell, one text input represents one animal-color pair
[19:18:47] <BillCriswell> kongthap: I'd do like <input name="items[0][animal]" value="0"> <input name="items[1][animal]" value="1"> and so on.
[19:19:14] <kongthap> BillCriswell, that sounds making sense :)
[19:20:03] <kongthap> BillCriswell, if i name the text input like so, how to use jquery to get it value may be at once statement?
[19:20:44] <BillCriswell> jim_j: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8945738/client-closed-connection-before-receiving-entire-response-onclick-tracking-err Does this help?
[19:20:57] <jim_j> checking
[19:21:21] <BillCriswell> kongthap: Can you rephrase that?
[19:21:53] <jim_j> billcriswell, I'm using ajax, but it's interesting.  although I'm not sure why the solution fixes it
[19:21:56] <kongthap> BillCriswell, what to rephrase?
[19:22:27] <BillCriswell> jim_j: So you're good?
[19:22:36] <BillCriswell> kongthap: Your question. Not sure what your goal is.
[19:23:12] <jim_j> no, I don't think it applies to me, just meant why it fixed it for the person asking on so
[19:23:39] <BillCriswell> jim_j: Can you replicate your code at jsbin.com
[19:23:47] <kongthap> BillCriswell, for example i expect <input name="items[0][0]" value="1"> to get animal=>0, color=>0, value=>1
[19:23:52] <jim_j> BillCriswell, ok
[19:25:15] <kongthap> BillCriswell, i would have <input name="items[0][0]" value="1">, <input name="items[0][1]" value="1">, <input name="items[0][2]" value="1"> ... how can i get value from those text input using single statement?, possible?
[19:26:37] <BillCriswell> kongthap: .serializeArray() would give you an array of the form data.
[19:27:01] <kongthap> BillCriswell, ok i will google more about the function, thanks :)
[19:29:05] <jim_j> BillCriswell, there's not much to it;  http://jsbin.com/vesovima/1/
[19:30:20] <jim_j> the share link doesn't seem to give what I saved
[19:39:59] <ph1> Cork, morning :)
[19:40:23] <ph1> We still can't get that script you were helping us with yesterday working
[19:40:24] <crocket> When did jquery stop supporting IE8?
[19:40:48] <ph1> since 1.9 or 1.11 one of the 2
[19:41:33] <crocket> phl : since 1.9?
[19:42:22] <ph1> crocket, sorry my bad since 2.x
[19:42:40] <ph1> http://jquery.com/download/
[19:43:01] <ph1> crocket, but if your using 1.x you should be fine
[19:44:09] <crocket> ewww
[19:45:01] <ph1> crocket, ?
[19:46:49] <crocket> phl : I'm frustrated.
[19:47:26] <ph1> Cork, lol me too :P
[19:47:51] <ph1> crocket, opps meant for you that one :P
[19:54:27] <jim_j> in an ajax jquery call, what prevents a post from going to the next page?
[19:56:40] <ph1> Cork, I have this script and we just need to get one piece working to enable me to throw out the php script that is currently wrapping json data returned from our js ajax query
[19:56:59] <ph1> Cork, can you take a look at it for me?
[20:05:17] <ph1> http://bin.cakephp.org/view/359843859 this is the script I'm talking about with some comments in at the top explaining what we've attempted so far.
[20:07:16] <ph1> Cork, this is what the php script is doing http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1455000417
[20:08:47] <ph1> and a sample of the json data as we showed you yesterday: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1136654849
[20:10:29] <ph1> Cork, I also have these two working examples, but I can't get them working also in our script. http://jsfiddle.net/3U33f/4/  and this one for appendData function: http://jsfiddle.net/3U33f/5/
[20:15:17] <ph1> Cork, would will appreciate if you could help us get this working ...
[20:18:55] <crocket> jQuery burns.
[20:34:32] <ph1> Cork, can I maybe pm the files to you because they're gonna get lost with all the scrolling in here
[20:48:00] <ph1> crocket, do you think you could give me a hand with that script?
[20:48:16] <crocket> phl : Can you explain?
[20:48:20] <crocket> what script
[20:48:32] <ph1> can I pm you all of it?
[20:48:51] <ph1> crocket, the history scrolling in here is a pain
[20:49:17] <crocket> phl : I don't understand what you mean.
[20:49:47] <ph1> crocket, I just mean can I pm the script and explanation to you
[20:51:52] <raj> Cork, are you around?
[21:03:34] <ph1> Can someone help me out here. We have a script that we want to wrap json data and put that into select elements on our web page.
[21:03:34] <ph1> Currently our json data is being manipulated by a php script wrapping it in option tags, and then the jquery is putting into the relevant elements, but we want to take the php script out of the equation and do it all in jquery.
[21:03:34] <ph1> Here are the scripts etc, with some working examples. The script also has comments with other examples we're been given, but I just don't kow how to plug them into the script to get it working properly
[21:03:34] <ph1> Working example 1 of what we are wanting to achieve http://jsfiddle.net/3U33f/4/
[21:03:35] <ph1> working example 2 http://jsfiddle.net/3U33f/5/
[21:03:37] <ph1> the script: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/359843859
[21:03:39] <ph1> json data: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1136654849
[21:03:41] <ph1> php script: http://bin.cakephp.org/view/1455000417
[21:04:10] <ph1> *we've
[21:07:28] <ph1> anyone?
[21:26:14] <raj> why is this happening? http://paste.ofcode.org/6hAUUGjLALj4GGsE5UzY7B
[21:28:00] <raj> this one is more informative--> http://paste.ofcode.org/iihguDmc8AR8pvRZNfx3sc
[22:03:58] <aro> is there a way to calculate the position of a dropped element in a list
[22:04:03] <aro> using draggable
[22:26:50] <le_gars> Hi Im trying to write some specs against different states of elements, like button enabled, button visible etc. Is it so that a button does not have 'enabled' state, but is in  fact 'disabled' true or false?
[22:57:55] <ocx> morning all
[22:59:34] <ocx> i have a question regarding local storage, i am loading some storage using var $value = window.localStorage.getItem("first_boot");  on index.html now when user jumps and loads a new href page.html i am trying to read that $value in that new page but it seems i am not allowed to do that, are the localstorage variable only available to the page that they belong to?
[23:05:56] <Jattenalle> le_gars, yes
[23:06:23] <le_gars> Jattenalle: ok
[23:06:49] <Jattenalle> ocx, as far as i know, you can set them to be available to the entire domain, not just the page (don't quote me on that though...)
[23:22:18] <ocx> is there a way to check all checkboxes on apage in 1 shot instead of selecting each?
[23:22:33] <ocx> like select them based on their type as checkbox
[23:23:42] <Jattenalle> ocx, use .prop('checked', true|false);
[23:24:51] <Jattenalle> ocx, $("input[type=checkbox]").prop('checked', true);
[23:25:21] <Jattenalle> or $('input:checkbox')
[23:25:35] <ocx> thanks :)
[23:25:42] <Jattenalle> http://api.jquery.com/checkbox-selector/
[23:28:16] <ravenzz> no need for input there
[23:28:26] <ravenzz> :checkbox will do the job
[23:28:29] <Cork> crocket, ph1: ie8 is supported in 1.x, ie < 9 is dropped in 2.x
[23:28:56] <Cork> crocket, ph1: both 1.x and 2.x is supported so you need to pick version based on if you need ie8 support
[23:30:10] <Cork> ph1: when you ask a question please state what you need, not just examples
[23:30:33] <Cork> ph1: cause i can't find what it is you need to have changed currently
[23:31:13] <Cork> ravenzz: but you most likely want the input
[23:31:27] * Cork actually checks to make sure
[23:31:53] <Cork> yup
[23:32:06] <Cork> ravenzz: if you run :checked you will loop over all elements in the page
[23:32:27] <ravenzz> ..
[23:32:29] <Cork> sure elm.nodeName === "input" will remove the ones you don't want
[23:32:36] <Cork> but you will still loop a lot more elements
[23:32:39] <ravenzz> she(?) said checkbox
[23:32:42] <ravenzz> not checked
[23:32:44] <Jattenalle> ravenzz, just :checkbox = *:checkbox.. there's no checkbox on, for example, a div.. no reason to include that
[23:33:11] <ravenzz> Jattenalle that's what I am saying
[23:33:18] <ravenzz> :checkbox is enough
[23:33:23] <Jattenalle> im saying it isnt
[23:33:38] <Jattenalle> and the documentation agrees with me and Cork
[23:34:15] <Jattenalle> besides, :checkbox is slower than input[type=checkbox] anyhow, so the latter should be used
[23:34:23] <ravenzz> ok
[23:34:41] <ravenzz> I thought jQuery did something smart, ie select all the input elements
[23:34:44] <ravenzz> and then filter them
[23:34:55] <Jattenalle> it does what you ask it to do, as it should
[23:35:32] <ravenzz> whatever
[23:35:40] <Cork> ravenzz: all : selectors jquery adds is function calls
[23:35:52] <Cork> ravenzz: they are looped over the set of matched elements on the left
[23:35:54] <ravenzz> it doesn't make sense to serch for div:checkbo
[23:35:55] <ravenzz> x
[23:36:04] <ravenzz> Cork gotcha
[23:36:13] <Cork> $(':checkbox') => $('*:checkbox')
[23:36:21] <ravenzz> yeah I got that
[23:36:37] <Jattenalle> you're right it doesnt make sense, that's why you shouldnt do it like that
[23:36:57] <Jattenalle> :P
[23:38:47] <Cork> ugg that code was hard to find
[23:39:11] <Cork> ravenzz: createInputPseudo is what is called for each element with :checkbox
[23:39:35] <Cork> well rather the function it returns
[23:40:53] <ph1> Cork, Hi Cork, sorry I was just looking after my son. We got it working in the end we just had to put some if statements in the success function. So it's all sorted now :)
[23:41:00] <ph1> Cork, thanks again for the help :)
[23:41:20] <ravenzz> I see, I will have a look at that as soon as I am fully awake :P
[23:42:32] <Cork> ravenzz: search for "// Add button/input type pseudos"
