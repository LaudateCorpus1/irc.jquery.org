[00:00:26] <boytoy> doug65536: that stuff is so beyond me
[00:00:33] <boytoy> feel free to share the fiddle still
[00:00:36] <boytoy> hiya noaXess
[00:00:36] <noaXess> i have a strange situation.. i use jquerui dialog inside it some form fields and a jqueryui selectable object... it works all what i need. but if inline html inside the dialog needs scrolling and i scoll down and click on a selectable item, it automatically scrolls up... in FF only first time.. and in IE each time i click on a selectable item..
[00:00:38] <noaXess> any hint?
[00:00:53] <noaXess> wait.. will provie code...
[00:01:32] <Cork> noaXess: sounds like you have a hash link that matches an id on the page
[00:02:10] <noaXess> Coaha.. i use hashchange for triggering content changes.. hm..
[00:02:58] <noaXess> have links in selectable items the # ?
[00:03:32] <Cork> not by default no
[00:04:22] <noaXess> Cork: jep.. it's like this.. even if i enter just # at the end of a normal linke with some normal qstrings, it scroll's at top.. even if this special dialog is open or not..
[00:04:41] <noaXess> thanks Cork that helps.. ;) sometime just write down problem.. and one simple hint cen do magic ;)
[00:09:15] <noaXess> hm.. it has nothing to do with the selectable elemnt i think.. cause.. if i click outside the dialog, eg. to firebugs window and click anywhere inside the dialog it autoscrolls dialog content to top+ some pix
[00:11:23] <noaXess> hm.. it has to do with the selectable stuff.. cause if i remove it, all works normal, w/o auto scrolling...
[00:12:45] <noaXess> the selectable code: http://paste.ubuntu.com/6144447/
[00:13:12] <noaXess> to inform. i added attribute pm and data to li element.. also w/o them autoscrolling happens..
[00:14:33] <doug65536> wow, seriously? you can't pass an array of deferreds to $.when?
[00:16:00] <noaXess> doug65536: not for me, right?
[00:16:11] <doug65536> right
[00:16:27] <Cork> doug65536: you can
[00:16:44] <Cork> $.when.apply(null, arr)
[00:16:56] <doug65536> yeah, I knew that...
[00:17:10] <doug65536> still, kind of ugly :(
[00:17:29] <Cork> well it is how you convert an array to arguments so...
[00:20:12] <doug65536> Cork: any idea how you would get at the context from a resolveWith in the when done callback?
[00:20:42] <doug65536> right now I am hacking around that by resolving with an array [this, actual]
[00:21:15] <Cork> doug65536: you mean you want to run resolveWith in a done or?
[00:22:27] <doug65536> no, I mean, when I resolve, I want to also pass along a context - using myDeferred.resolveWith(context, data) ... but in $.when(...).done there is only one context.
[00:22:41] <Cork> ah
[00:22:53] <Cork> ya, i think that is how $.when works
[00:23:07] <doug65536> ok thanks
[00:23:09] <Cork> don't think there is a built in solution to handle multiple contexts
[00:23:33] * Cork checks to make sure
[00:23:48] <doug65536> I figured. I hacked around it by using .resolve([context, data]) then in when.done I unwrap them
[00:24:01] <Cork> doug65536: this should be an array from .when
[00:24:14] <doug65536> ah!
[00:24:15] <doug65536> neat
[00:24:16] <Cork> contexts[ i ] = this; deferred.resolveWith( contexts, values );
[00:24:20] <Cork> this is what when does
[00:28:52] <doug65536> boytoy: I don't know if it still works correctly, but I added the deferred thing to handle "when all done" http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/zz4vD/15/
[00:30:11] <ph88> when i do .prop('checked', true); on a checkbox ... no event is triggered ??
[00:30:28] <doug65536> ph88: what event did you want
[00:31:03] <ph88> if i do $( "#foo" ).trigger( "click" );       then it will uncheck it again :|
[00:31:35] <doug65536> ph88: make your handler handle change, and chain into trigger('change')
[00:31:47] <doug65536> .prop('checked', true).trigger('change')
[00:32:36] <itsrummy> hi jquerymobile people, i have a problem with a multi page document and "pageshow" not running... http://pastebin.com/UBbSc0gB     am I doing something wrong, is jquerymobile broken, or is what I am trying now unsupported?
[00:32:36] <Cork> ph88: or invert the value you set and trigger('click') :)
[00:32:58] <Cork> prop('checked', !true).trigger('click')
[00:33:04] <ph88> lol :P
[00:33:06] <ph88> creative
[00:33:35] <ph88> that might be better because i still need it to respond to click events too
[00:33:46] <ph88> i have a group checkbox that checks all the other checkboxes
[00:33:51] <MPer> Hello. I am using jQuery 1.10.2, jQuery UI 1.9.2. When I call toArray on a sortable I get an array of objects instead of ids. It worked on an earlier version. Did toArray change? Or what can change the behavier of toArray?
[00:33:57] <doug65536> ph88: it's not better, it's the same. change will fire anyway
[00:34:00] <ph88> and single checkboxes that are part of the group
[00:34:12] <ph88> oh ok ^^
[00:37:27] <doug65536> ph88: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ABmmH/3/
[00:39:01] <ph88> looks good doug65536  http://jsfiddle.net/ABmmH/4/
[00:39:36] <doug65536> ph88: you read my mind :)
[00:40:07] <ph88> :)
[00:40:57] <doug65536> ph88: I actually started writing a fiddle to prove correct behavior when you posted yours
[00:41:26] <ph88> i think you already proved it
[00:42:52] <doug65536> ph88: at one time I was annoyed by events not firing for programmatic changes, they one day, duh! I can trigger it myself :D
[00:43:05] <Cork> :)
[00:43:24] <Cork> what annoys me the most is how change works on text fields
[00:43:25] <ph88> lol :p
[00:43:29] <Cork> (triggers on blur)
[00:43:35] <doug65536> Cork: agreed
[00:43:48] <Cork> though input kinda handles that
[00:44:21] <Cork> though you have to bind both input and change if you bind all fields through delegate, as checkbox and select doens't trigger input -_-'
[00:45:18] <boytoy> doug65536: nice, ive never seen anything like this
[00:45:52] <boytoy> like a whole new world has been opened up to me. thanks again mate.. playing with it now will keep you posted
[00:46:21] <doug65536> boytoy: yeah, it's how you handle doing several ajax and processing "when all done". normally you have a fixed number of deferreds, so it is a little more elegant, you have that many data parameters in the when done callback
[00:46:51] <doug65536> mine uses apply and arguments array to make it handle N number of deferreds
[00:48:51] <doug65536> boytoy: typical use of deferred is var a = $.post('url',data,null,'json'), b = $.post('url2',data2,null,'json'); $.when(a, b).done(function(dataA, dataB) { ... })
[00:49:26] <doug65536> boytoy: that last done callback is called when all done
[00:50:02] <boytoy> cool
[00:50:17] <boytoy> gonna take a while for all this to sink in but i think im getting the gist of it
[00:50:39] <boytoy> hope others in this chan can benefit from this too
[00:50:57] <noaXess> need any hint.. dialog, inside dialog some text, htm form fields and a jquery ui selectable ol list... now.. if i scroll down in that dialog, click on any other window, like this irc channel window and click back to the dialog it scrolls automatically up... the app triggers hash changes but i think, it's not that.. cause. if i disable the selectable list, no autoscrolling..
[00:50:58] <doug65536> I was baffled by the deferred documentation at first myself
[00:56:26] <Syrit> Hello guys, I am using jQuery Datepicker for the first time, and the nav bar in my app, is fixed position, so, when the datepicer pops up, it's hidden under the nav bar, how can i fix this ?
[00:58:10] <boytoy> doug65536: seems to have lost its ability to resize
[00:59:34] <doug65536> boytoy: yeah, I noticed that. that's why I said " I don't know if it still works correctly"
[01:00:30] <doug65536> boytoy: I'll take a closer look
[01:01:42] <boytoy> doug65536: i removed some unnecessary stuff from http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/UmV9Y/
[01:02:09] <boytoy> * i removed some unnecessary stuff in
[01:02:41] <boytoy> youtubes look good though!
[01:06:20] <doug65536> boytoy: embedly's done callback sends in a weird 'this'
[01:06:54] <doug65536> boytoy: it is actually a deferred. what's up with that?
[01:07:00] <boytoy> doug65536: im in frequent contact with them, is this something i should report?
[01:07:10] <boytoy> hmmm
[01:07:36] <doug65536> boytoy: I doubt it is a problem... just wondering what you are doing with it. you were doing $(this).parent()...
[01:08:04] <doug65536> right?
[01:09:45] <boytoy> doug65536: oh right
[01:10:34] <boytoy> yes uhm.. i guess i wont be doing that anymore then
[01:11:38] <boytoy> doug65536: $this => $(this) seemed to do the trick =)
[01:11:59] <boytoy> thanks for pointing that out
[01:14:29] <boytoy> doug65536: i owe you a huge favor, pm me if you need any design work please, would love to give something back
[01:15:12] <boytoy> http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/UmV9Y/5/embedded/result/ -- now i can finally sit back, relax and actually enjoy these videos
[01:15:39] <doug65536> boytoy: :)
[01:17:51] <amitprakash> Hi, for an ajax request, how do I detect if a timeout occurred in the failure callback?
[01:18:17] <amitprakash> Alternately, how can I figure out what http status code did I get?
[01:19:41] <M3kH> Good Morning!
[01:42:25] <boytoy> doug65536: hey am i missing something obvious? http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/UmV9Y/6/ -- shouldn't that h1 only display once?
[01:44:29] <doug65536> boytoy: yes look, it is inside the loop - it will happen once per deferred
[01:44:34] <doug65536> boytoy: see line 22
[01:46:14] <boytoy> ah yes yes ofcourse
[01:47:21] <Cork> doug65536: you don't use new with deferred
[01:48:06] <xec_> it doesn't matter
[01:48:21] <Cork> well, ya cause new will be a none action there
[01:48:25] <Cork> but it isn't needed
[01:49:05] <xec_> well, it *is* a constructor
[01:49:11] <xec_> hence the capital "D"
[01:49:18] <xec_> so using new is good practice
[01:50:20] <Cork> xec: no it isn't a constructor per definition
[01:50:32] <Cork> it does var deferred = {}; return deferred;
[01:50:40] <Cork> so it creates an object and returns that object
[01:50:57] <Cork> a constructor is called on the object as it is created
[01:51:17] <xec_> well, it depends on how you define the term
[01:51:26] <Cork> xec: the term used in js
[01:51:32] <xec_> then it is
[01:51:33] <xec_> ;)
[01:51:34] <xec_> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[01:51:34] <Cork> no
[01:51:51] <doug65536> Cork: doc says it is optional
[01:51:58] <Cork> xec: if it was a constructor it would modify this, not a separate {} tag
[01:52:05] <Cork> doug65536: ya, cause it is a none action
[01:52:25] <Cork> as if you use it as a constructor it will throw away the object you create as it returns deferred
[01:52:30] <doug65536> Cork: it doesn't have to do "if (this === window) return new Deferred(...)
[01:52:52] <Cork> it never does new Deferred
[01:52:53] <xec_> it's a non-issue, not worth discussing. but I agree with the docs, it is a constructor in the sense that it creates a new object which is returned
[01:52:55] <doug65536> Cork: yeah? ok then the docs are dumb then
[01:53:34] <xec_> using the this keyword is bad practice because it requires the new keyword...
[01:53:37] <Cork> doug65536: new $.Deferred() creates an object, the object is called with the constructor, the constructor internally creates a new object (var deferred = {};) and the original objet is gc
[01:53:45] <Cork> so new is pointless here
[01:54:14] <xec_> but good practice
[01:54:19] <Cork> xec: no
[01:54:21] <xec_> yes
[01:54:26] <xec_> because of the way it is named
[01:54:31] <xec_> it has a capital D
[01:54:32] <Cork> xec: for example $ IS a constructor wrapper
[01:54:36] <doug65536> Cork: then whoever wrote the Deferred function is an idiot, because convention is capitalized function is a constructor, and also, doc says new is optional, which I took to mean, if you are dumb and don't use 'new' it will check if this == window and 'new' it for you
[01:54:36] <xec_> its just semantics
[01:54:47] <Cork> it calls new $,prototype.init()
[01:54:52] <Cork> THAT is a constructor
[01:55:13] <Cork> doug65536: but the jquery standard is to never expose constructors
[01:55:41] <Cork> they are always internal, and a wrapper function is doing the constructor call
[01:56:08] <xec_> so... it doesn't matter :p
[01:56:28] <Cork> xec: well if you call making extra gc in the code semantic; then you have a different meaning for semantics then i do
[01:56:45] <doug65536> this is a pattern I use: function Something(xxx) { if (this === window) { /* caller forgot new */ return new Something(); } ... }
[01:57:04] <doug65536> s/\(\)/(xxx)/
[01:57:07] <xec_> Cork: it is a naming convention
[01:57:09] <Cork> new deffered(); is basically the same as doing var deferred = {}; defered = { done: function() {} }
[01:57:23] <xec_> Cork: http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html#names
[01:57:33] <Cork> xec: new is to be used with constructors, not function calls
[01:57:52] <Cork> and $.Deferred() is a function NOT a constructor
[01:57:55] <xec_> Cork: only constructors should have a name that start with a capital letter
[01:58:09] <Cork> xec: well blame the one writing the function
[01:58:13] <Cork> cause it isn't a constructor
[01:58:32] <doug65536> doc: Description: A constructor function that returns a chainable utility object with methods to register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state of any synchronous or asynchronous function.
[01:58:40] <doug65536> ... a constructor function ...
[01:58:44] <Cork> xec: constructors modify "this" as THAT is the created object
[01:58:57] <xec_> Cork: not necessarily
[01:59:02] <Cork> of you return a variable then its a function
[01:59:02] <doug65536> The jQuery.Deferred() constructor creates a new Deferred object. The new operator is optional.
[01:59:08] <doug65536> key word: constructor
[01:59:41] <Cork> doug65536: but like i said, the code is a function; not a constructor
[01:59:58] <doug65536> you may say that. the documentation doesn't. therefore, I used new
[02:00:00] <Cork> i seriously don't care what the docs says when the code is clearly something else
[02:00:01] <xec_> Cork: that's what i disagree with - it does return a new object, so it's really arguable whether you can call it a constructor. the jquery team has decided to call it a constructor...
[02:00:14] <doug65536> I'm saying why I used new
[02:00:45] <Cork> xec: function cons() {}; var obj  = new cons(); is a constructor
[02:00:49] <Cork> cause it will create an object
[02:01:06] <xec_> Cork: it should be named Cons
[02:01:06] <Cork> the object created is create BY "new"
[02:01:07] <xec_> ;)
[02:01:11] <Cork> xec: that'
[02:01:18] <Cork> that's just namin convention
[02:01:22] <xec_> "just"
[02:01:24] <computer2000> ot: heres some easy math for you guys. i have a 4gb file and am writing it to a usb stick with 4mb/s transfer rate. how long will it take to transfer?
[02:01:49] <Cork> xec: so you mean convention is what matters and how the language works is irrelevant?
[02:02:09] <xec_> Cork: i'm saying conventions are there for a reason and should be followed
[02:02:27] <Cork> xec: well yes, when they are correct
[02:02:30] <xec_> Cork: teaching people to ignore the casing and the docs is counter-productive
[02:02:34] <Cork> but calling a function a constructor is wrong
[02:02:49] <Cork> as you create two objects, where the first is just given straight to the gc
[02:02:53] <Cork> and that is just silly
[02:02:58] <xec_> Cork: that's where we disagree, because a constructor in javascript will be... a function
[02:03:34] <Cork> xec: so var o = {};  o = { key:value }; is fine in your point of view?
[02:03:45] <Cork> you don't see where that is a problem?
[02:04:18] <Cork> compared to var o = {}; o.key = value;
[02:04:22] <xec_> it doesn't matter nearly as much as following a convention that could lead to buggy code
[02:04:34] <Cork> O_o'
[02:04:49] <doug65536> computer2000: 1000 seconds, which is 16 minutes or so
[02:05:09] <Cork> well i rather take that then gc freezes cause of excessive gc runs cause of all the extra object allocations you make...
[02:05:15] <xec_> if you want to argue about what to call $.Deferred , you could say it's not a function but a method
[02:05:48] <Cork> xec: i argue to use commands for how they are meant to be used
[02:05:54] <xec_> or you can call is a function. or a constructor - like the docs do
[02:05:58] <doug65536> Cork: it is a generational gc and becomes immediately unreachable, so the gc overhead is negligible, especially when not in a loop
[02:05:59] <Cork> and jquery NEVER use constructors
[02:05:59] <xec_> it*
[02:06:21] <Cork> doug65536: not all browsers use ggc
[02:06:52] <doug65536> well, shame on them then
[02:07:04] <doug65536> last time I checked, it was 2013
[02:08:35] <Cork> doug65536: also it depends on how performance important things are
[02:08:55] <Cork> doug65536: cause if you do ex. js animation you don't want to trigger gc at all
[02:09:02] <Cork> as that will affect the animation
[02:09:58] <Cork> cause things like that becomes the difference between butter smooth and slightly jumpy
[02:10:15] <doug65536> that opens up the whole "you shouldn't cache things when there's a gc" argument. the argument is, caching lots of things makes determining reachability more expensive during a collect
[02:10:50] <Cork> doug65536: that actually the totally oposite actually
[02:11:11] <Cork> you should cache things, but in a generic point, and avoid creating garbage in loops
[02:11:28] <doug65536> gc = new is free, collect is expensive. you are avoiding the free thing and making the expensive thing more expensive. that's the argument against caching
[02:11:38] <Cork> and creating a pointless object in a loop (that is never used) is a good example of that
[02:12:20] <Cork> doug65536: what?
[02:12:38] <Cork> doug65536: var deferred = {}; is also a form of new
[02:12:40] <doug65536> free as in, almost no cost
[02:12:53] <Cork> you can write that as var deferred = new Object(); if you prefer
[02:13:46] <Cork> doug65536: the point is that new on a function that makes a return create extra garbage
[02:13:49] <doug65536> Cork: are you still on about that? I said I did it based on the documentation. I don't go looking at source to see if I can avoid new. I call new when something is a constructor. I believe you.
[02:14:27] <Cork> doug65536: well the argument has been about it not having any cost and so on
[02:14:47] <doug65536> new is pretty much a single compare-and-swap
[02:14:53] <doug65536> assuming there is room in gen 0
[02:15:13] <Cork> new is a call to allocate memory for the object
[02:15:29] <Cork> the function is then given this object and does what it wants with it
[02:15:41] <Cork> unless the constructor returns something else
[02:15:47] <doug65536> I just told you how it is implemented in the actual engine. now you are telling me basics
[02:15:51] <Cork> where the original object is gc'ed if that happens
[02:16:38] <Cork> doug65536: guess we have looked at different engines then
[02:16:52] <doug65536> fetch the "top of gen0 pointer", see if there is sufficient room, if there is, add that many bytes to the pointer, store out the reference, interlocked compare exchange the top of gen0 pointer, loop if another thread changed it
[02:17:30] <doug65536> what I am saying is, with a gc, 'new' is blazing fast
[02:17:56] <doug65536> do we agree on that?
[02:18:37] <Cork> new is fast, sure the memory effect and the resulting gc is not
[02:18:59] <Cork> (and yes often it doesn't matter, but there are cases where you don't want to create extra memory)
[02:21:42] <anl_> I have found no logic which dom items that firebug colors in a disabled fashion
[02:21:56] <anl_> Is there anyone that have some extra information on the subject?
[02:22:14] <Cork> anl_: disabled fashion?
[02:22:20] <anl_> You know, grayed out
[02:22:50] <Cork> anl_: well normally it's disabled, or hidden with ex. display: none
[02:23:03] <Cork> or it might be an element not in the dom (if you use the dom inspector)
[02:23:07] <anl_> I am talking about visible items now, but yes, you are right about that
[02:23:19] <anl_> They are in the dom and in front of me in the browser, clearly visible
[02:23:25] <Cork> shouldn't be gray if they are visible
[02:23:26] <anl_> It is so strange
[02:23:42] <anli_> Oh, sorry, I disguised myself
[02:23:44] <Cork> unless the view is out of sync for some reason
[02:23:45] <anli_> Its me, anli_
[02:24:02] <anli_> Then firebug has been out of sync for a while now
[02:24:17] <Cork> anli_: do you have an example link/demo of this?
[02:24:33] <anli_> http://gtvinimport.se/ , check <div class="dots">
[02:25:43] <Cork> anli_: dimentions: 0x0
[02:25:54] <doug65536> anli_: not exactly applicable but chrome's debugger has a DOM mutation breakpoint capability
[02:26:11] <anli_> Aha, so I can see when some property is changing?
[02:26:17] <doug65536> yes
[02:26:22] <anli_> It is probably useful information to me
[02:26:41] <anli_> I wish I just could leave firefox, but there is something I like about it
[02:26:49] <Cork> both opera, chrome and firebug has that
[02:26:58] <anli_> Thats also useful info
[02:27:12] <doug65536> anli_: https://developers.google.com/chrome-developer-tools/docs/javascript-debugging#breakpoints-mutation-events
[02:27:13] <anli_> firebug also has some slowness
[02:27:14] <Cork> in firebug you enable it from the html tab dropdown
[02:27:31] <Cork> ya, but it is still the best developer tool around
[02:27:42] <anli_> ah, cool, people are some chrome oriented
[02:27:46] <anli_> You are not then
[02:27:49] <Cork> it has features no other provides
[02:27:59] <doug65536> Cork: what does
[02:28:03] <Cork> anli_: i focused on all browsers before
[02:28:13] <Cork> but now days i dropped opera, as they quit
[02:28:50] <Cork> doug65536: you can work with the dom and css in ways that is impossible in native firefox
[02:29:01] <Cork> and in chrome some is hard and some is also impossible
[02:29:22] <Cork> but chrome is in much better state though
[02:29:33] <doug65536> Cork: can you name one thing? I can give a list of things firebug can't do
[02:29:48] <Cork> doug65536: for example you have a view over the parsed dom in firebug
[02:30:03] <Cork> there is a lot of other things, and i don't have them all in fresh memory
[02:30:30] <Cork> doug65536: most of them isn't major, but it is just enough to make me miss firebug when i don't use it :)
[02:30:34] <doug65536> Cork: that is the elements tab in chrome, shows live dom, editable too, you can change the html right there
[02:31:45] <doug65536> Cork: here's why I can't use firebug: you can't debug across domains, it says access denied. you can't tell it to break only on *uncaught* exceptions, it insists on breaking at every one
[02:32:15] <Cork> doug65536: uh, you can add rules to the breakpoints
[02:32:21] <doug65536> you also can't switch context in the console
[02:32:26] <Cork> you can
[02:32:29] <Cork> cd
[02:32:33] <doug65536> well, you can with that hiddeous cd command
[02:32:35] <doug65536> yes
[02:32:41] <doug65536> cd to whay
[02:32:44] <doug65536> what
[02:32:47] <doug65536> good luck with that
[02:33:21] <Cork> if you mean context from a function you do that in the script tab
[02:33:33] <doug65536> I want to like firebug. I think google is evil and chrome is unstable. but the debugger is really good
[02:34:00] <Cork> doug65536: true, it is better if you look at memory footprint and stability
[02:34:16] <Cork> but firebug still have a few features not found anywhere else
[02:34:52] <anli_> Did I start a discussion? ;)
[02:34:58] <doug65536> webkit came from apple right?
[02:35:04] <Cork> no
[02:35:09] <Cork> it game from kde
[02:35:13] <Cork> in khtml
[02:35:16] <Pupeno> doug65536: no, it came from KDE. It wall called khtml.
[02:35:16] <doug65536> oh good
[02:35:27] <Cork> khtml > apple webkit >
[02:35:40] <Pupeno> I was a KDE developer when they announced that, it was pretty awesome.
[02:36:10] <doug65536> apple is the most greedy monopolistic bunch of a-holes on earth imho
[02:36:10] <Cork> Pupeno: sadly almost no sites supported khtml
[02:36:21] <Cork> doug65536: google isn't much better
[02:36:40] <Cork> (and simetimes arguably worse)
[02:36:43] <anli_> google cooperates with nestle
[02:36:54] <anli_> child slavey isnt exactly in the time
[02:36:54] <Cork> *sometimes
[02:36:58] <anli_> slavery
[02:37:03] <Cork> O_o
[02:37:10] <anli_> lol
[02:37:17] <anli_> You know about nestle, right?
[02:37:17] <Cork> where did slavery get into the subject?
[02:37:24] <Pupeno> Cork: yeah... it was a bit weird to see khtml go from being the renderer that shouldn't exist. Nobody paid attention to it, everybody was saying that it should be dropped and Firefox's be adopted. To the current situation.
[02:37:25] <anli_> When I introducted it :)
[02:38:01] <Cork> Pupeno: sadly webkit has become a beast to replace ie6
[02:38:14] <ravenzz> does jquery jasmine have a support channel?
[02:41:58] <Cork> anli_: no i can't say i new about that deal before you mentioned it; though i don't know where slavery comes into the picture there
[02:42:18] <anli_> ah, it is that google has got some badwill lately
[02:42:51] <anli_> It is probably out of scope of the discussion however
[02:42:58] <Cork> most likely
[02:44:27] <Dudi> hello guys I have problem with .fadein() and fadeout(); it doesn't set position: absolute for div
[02:44:54] <Cork> Dudi: why would fade set absolute?
[02:46:49] <Dudi> Cork i thought it should for calling fadeout and fadein at the same time
[02:47:06] <Cork> Dudi: what do you mean?
[02:47:38] <Cork> the element will set display: <original value>; and then animate opacity
[02:47:42] <Cork> that's all it does
[02:47:47] <Dudi> Cork http://cleancanvas.herokuapp.com/services.html Efect in Services (option 3)
[02:48:48] <Cork> Dudi: you mean that develop ends up below design when hovered?
[02:51:09] <Dudi> Cork I mean that transition effect on text when you click on cilick circle
[02:52:00] <Cork> Dudi: where is the code?
[02:52:35] <Dudi> nvm
[02:53:06] <crazydiamond> Hi. Can anyone suggest what is "jquery-1.10.2.min.map" file and why browser tries to download it?
[02:54:43] <Cork> Dudi: you have position absolute, without a left/top/right/bottom value
[02:54:54] <Cork> Dudi: that might be a cause of the problem
[02:55:51] <Cork> crazydiamond: it's a unminify file
[02:56:16] <Cork> crazydiamond: used to display something readable when there is a minified script loaded
[02:56:46] <Cork> crazydiamond: you can disable it in the browser or download the .map from code.jquery.org
[02:57:00] <crazydiamond> Cork: thanks!
[02:57:10] <Cork> crazydiamond: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.map
[03:00:43] <boytoy> doug65536: just curious http://embedly.github.io/embedly-jquery/ seems to have a deferred example thats a lot simpler than ours, should i simplify based on that or is our fiddle already as simple as can be?
[03:00:43] <Ububegin> I populate my html using json data and jquery..  for loop { tr.append("<td>"+ jsonData[i])... } $('table').append(tr) .. But this is inside an ajax call.. but instead of refreshing the table everytime.. the new data is just appended to the end of the table..
[03:01:39] <Cork> Ububegin: build a set of tr's and use html instead of append
[03:01:51] <ravenzz> Ububegin you should create the new table and later replace the old one
[03:02:31] <Cork> var body = []; body.push(tr); $('table tbody').html(body);
[03:02:50] <Cork> (where you run the html() outside the loop)
[03:06:52] <Ububegin> Cork: what is the html method
[03:07:01] <Cork> ?api html
[03:07:02] <b-ot> Cork: .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[03:09:56] <doug65536> boytoy: if it natively supports deferred, sure, use that
[03:11:07] <doug65536> boytoy: I didn't expect it to have deferred support, which is why I implemented a simple "wait until all are done" use of deferred
[03:14:34] <googol7> Hi, I use simple HTML select widgets in a jQuery Mobile single page app. Since iOS 7 the following behavior occurs: if you use it as a homescreen app and you click into the select widget jQuery Mobile redirects to another page (the change event didn't occur yet!). With iOS 6 this does not occur. This happens if the select widget is in then vertical center of the page so that the iOS 7 select widget would overlap the HTML select widget. If the HTML sele
[03:14:35] <googol7> widget is on top of the page it does not happen as the iOS 7 select widget does not overlap the HTML select widget when it get's the input focus.
[03:14:44] <googol7> just filed an issue here: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/6500
[03:14:45] <b-ot> googol7: Issue #6500 by googol7 (37s ago): iOS 7 homescreen app redirects to other page when widget gets input focus
[03:17:00] <googol7> i mean multipage app
[03:22:25] <doug65536> any ideas how to deal with "back" when using pushState? what if they have unsaved changes??
[03:22:48] <doug65536> how do I "abort" the back if the choose not to lose changes
[03:23:13] <doug65536> MDN says that popstate event is not cancelable
[03:23:31] <doug65536> onbeforeunload doesn't fire either
[03:24:02] <zmode> hello again #jquery. i need to attach datepicker to many input fields, but it takes quite a lot of time. is there a way to speed this up? is each() the culprit here? code: http://sprunge.us/LcbT , profiler: http://i.imgur.com/ImY7KOo.png
[03:24:11] <Cork> doug65536: i think you need to use popstate and repush the state if you want to prevent it
[03:25:50] <doug65536> Cork: so in my popstate handler, just popState and re-push the current state, if they choose not to lose the changes? I assume that wipes their forward history right (which is fine)
[03:26:17] <mls_> hi there
[03:26:21] <Cork> doug65536: ya, it isn't ideal, but it is the only way i can think of
[03:26:26] <mls_> jsfiddle isn't working with IE9 ?
[03:26:35] <mls_> http://jsfiddle.net/tHfQn/1/
[03:26:51] <doug65536> Cork: appreciated, I was practically stuck on that :)
[03:30:26] <mls_> damn space...
[03:30:40] <mls_> found it, no space between <!-- and [if IE]
[03:31:40] <zmode> oh, i don't need to use each() at all!
[03:32:31] <zmode> and yet it's still slow
[03:34:34] <zmode> removing the line that sets the animation option was the issue. couldn't care less for it. sorry for the spam
[03:43:43] <MPer> Guys, why do I get an object as a return of an .attr() call?
[03:43:53] <MPer> That should be a string...
[03:45:34] <doug65536> MPer: what attribute
[03:46:42] <MPer> "id"
[03:47:04] <Cork> MPer: are you sure the object is a jquery object?
[03:47:18] <Cork> or rather that the underlayen value is a dom element
[03:47:27] <Cork> cause yes dom attributes are always strings
[03:47:32] <MPer> HTMLLIElement
[03:48:14] <MPer> the call is made in jQuery UI sortable serialize function
[03:49:06] <doug65536> MPer: yeah, I just made sure. even if you tried to assign an object to id (because of a bug), it toString's it - getting 'id' returns the string "[Object object]"
[03:49:27] <doug65536> er, [object Object]
[03:49:46] <Cork> MPer: that should still be a string
[03:50:09] <Cork> so ya, something has to be messing something up before this call
[03:50:59] <MPer> Yes... but what can mess up jQuery to not doing what it should?
[03:51:11] <ravenzz> what about a
[03:51:11] <Cork> MPer: jquery isn't doing anything
[03:51:13] <ravenzz> ?demo
[03:51:13] <b-ot> ravenzz: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:51:13] <ravenzz> ?
[03:51:19] <Cork> MPer: the dom is doing it
[03:51:28] <Cork> jqeury just requests the value from the dom
[03:51:59] <Cork> MPer: domElement.getAttribute('id')
[03:52:17] <Cork> (that should always be a string)
[03:52:18] <doug65536> var attribute = { id: { foo: "no way" } }; $(attribute).attr('id')        <-- that returns an object
[03:52:40] <Cork> ya that's why i asked about the dom element before
[03:53:09] <MPer> ravenzz, I prepared a demo yesterday for you, but I guess it took too much time. Demo is here: http://www.qr-g.com/index.php login is test/test. Page is in german, sorry.
[03:53:52] <ravenzz> ok how do I replicate the error?
[03:53:57] <MPer> ravenzz, press on the edit button left
[03:54:19] <ravenzz> done
[03:54:30] <MPer> ravenzz, on the next page press 'Speichern'
[03:55:17] <ravenzz> ok
[03:55:38] <MPer> ravenzz, that's not the exactly same error I discussed here, but I can make you see that too if you want
[03:55:55] <testirc> http://mypopup.ir/v2/go/2815/bc0dd00790279d6fd1ebe10b6a4a47c7
[03:56:24] <Cork> testirc: please don't dump links in the channel
[03:56:41] <Cork> testirc: at least say what it is first
[03:56:59] <Cork> yay... spammer...
[03:57:30] <ravenzz> MPer I wasn't here yesterday, I don't know what are you talking about
[03:57:51] <MPer> ravenzz, err! Friday I meant
[03:58:08] <MPer> ravenzz, the working day before today :)
[03:58:14] <rigel> http://jsfiddle.net/72b7w/
[03:58:42] <rigel> so i'd like the show button to show the (wrong) below the selection as well as the "lol" below
[03:58:44] <ravenzz> same thing, I was enjonying the Sicilian sun I guess
[03:58:50] <rigel> instead of removing a line there
[04:01:15] <Imaginativeone> I managed to successly traverse an xml-tree, but...
[04:01:23] <Imaginativeone> how can I work with the nodes now?
[04:01:46] <doug65536> Imaginativeone: you use $.parseXML right?
[04:02:07] <Imaginativeone> doug65536: yes
[04:02:36] <Imaginativeone> I can sorta understand that my nodes are now jQuery objects
[04:03:01] <Imaginativeone> but I'm having trouble actually presenting/changing those objects
[04:03:24] <doug65536> Imaginativeone: I like using scoped selectors, var myxml = $.parseXML(xml); $('person[id=123] weight', myxml).attr('unit')
[04:03:59] <doug65536> Imaginativeone: can you show code?
[04:03:59] <rigel> anyone?
[04:04:03] <Imaginativeone> not sure what you did there...
[04:04:05] <rigel> bueller?
[04:04:13] <MPer> ravenzz, if you want to see the error regarding the sortable please open the gallery by clicking on 'Gallerie' and try to swap pictures.
[04:04:23] <Imaginativeone> oh noooo…don't have the code with me today
[04:04:34] <Imaginativeone> will you be available later?
[04:04:46] <doug65536> Imaginativeone: I parsed the xml, then I made a selector that finds <person id="123"> ... <weight unit="kg">50</weight>
[04:05:07] <Imaginativeone> and attached "unit"?
[04:05:17] <doug65536> it returns 'kg'
[04:05:17] <Imaginativeone> as an attribute of weight?
[04:05:49] <Imaginativeone> aaaahhh...
[04:05:58] <Imaginativeone> that was extremely helpful
[04:06:27] <Imaginativeone> once I find the node, can I make changes to it?
[04:06:56] <Imaginativeone> if so, this is TOTALLY what I need
[04:07:06] <doug65536> Imaginativeone: .text("60") would change the weight content to 60. .attr('unit', 'lb') would change the unit to lb, etc
[04:07:23] <doug65536> Imaginativeone: .text() would return "50"
[04:07:41] <Imaginativeone> many, many thanks
[04:07:50] <Imaginativeone> I'll tell you how it goes
[04:11:42] <ravenzz> MPer that's weird
[04:13:05] <MPer> ravenzz, yes... I even disabled one plugin I had, the fileupload
[04:13:50] <ravenzz> $(o.item || this).attr(o.attribute || "id")
[04:14:16] <MPer> o.item is undefined, so it's more like this.attr()
[04:14:26] <ravenzz> here o.item and o.attribute are undefined, so it is executing $(this).attr("id") and surprisely it returns a jQuery object
[04:14:34] <MPer> yup
[04:14:55] <ravenzz> surprisingly*
[04:15:16] <ravenzz> have you tried to include a different version of jQuery?
[04:15:26] <MPer> which totally breaks the following -match call of course
[04:15:32] <ravenzz> yep
[04:15:35] <doug65536> ravenzz: if you pass an object to $() it "believes" that it is a DOM element, and treats it as such. if that happened to have properties that are like a dom element, jquery will happily treat it as a dom element
[04:16:18] <ravenzz> doug65536 never encountered that issue when doing  $(this).attr('foo')
[04:16:25] <MPer> yes, 1.9. can do that if you want
[04:16:30] <timmy01> chk
[04:16:59] <doug65536> ravenzz: <doug65536> var attribute = { id: { foo: "no way" } }; $(attribute).attr('id')        <-- that returns an object
[04:17:08] <ravenzz> this is not the case
[04:17:44] <ravenzz> again here $(o.item || this).attr(o.attribute || "id") o.item and o.attribute are undefined
[04:17:56] <MPer> want me to enable 1.9?
[04:18:00] <ravenzz> try that
[04:18:03] <timmy01> does anyone know where i can get a sample to do a test with AJAX/JSON crossdown with the lastest jQuery?
[04:18:21] <timmy01> crossdomain that is
[04:19:10] <doug65536> timmy01: use jsonp, configure the server to return permissive CORS headers, or go through a proxy service like http://corsproxy.com/
[04:19:31] <MPer> ravenzz, refresh and you get 1.9.1 now
[04:19:58] <MPer> ravenzz, unfortunately it's the same
[04:19:59] <timmy01> thanx doug. the thing is i wanna use it in phonegap
[04:20:30] <lemonsparrow> I am getting TypeError: document.getElementsByClassName(...)[0] is undefined for  document.getElementsByClassName("jj_menu_item")[0].click()
[04:20:31] <lemonsparrow> isnt that a valid javascript code ?
[04:20:52] <ravenzz> MPer it is
[04:22:52] <Cork> lemonsparrow: yes it is IF the class exist
[04:23:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: but if document.getElementsByClassName("jj_menu_item") doesn't find any elements [0] will try to work on undefined
[04:24:29] <Cork> lemonsparrow: that is what jquery brings to the table :)
[04:24:41] <Cork> that you don't have to do the if(result) all over the code
[04:25:09] <marsilainen> hi all, I'm trying to trigger a function when a form is submitted:  $('form#add_folder_form').on('submit', MyFunction);         however, MyFunction is called when the form is loaded, before it's ever submitted
[04:25:27] <marsilainen> any idea why that could be?
[04:26:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork: it is working actually that class appears when I click on another element so now it's working fine thanks
[04:27:10] <Cork> marsilainen: don't use element tags before id's that is a waist of performance (why are so many ppl doing this...)
[04:27:53] <Cork> marsilainen: about the trigger your sure you'r not doing something like $('form#add_folder_form').on('submit', MyFunction());?
[04:29:33] <marsilainen> Cork: no, definitely no () after the function name
[04:29:53] <Cork> marsilainen: see so you don't have any trigger() in the code or similar then
[04:30:01] <marsilainen> the function is defined as:    MyFunction = function() { ... };
[04:30:05] <Cork> (basically what i'm saying is: this should not happen)
[04:30:06] <marsilainen> no trigger, no
[04:30:18] <marsilainen> yeah, I've obviously got some silly behaviour going on
[04:30:37] <marsilainen> and I'm no JS expert so it's probably something I'm overlooking about how things work in JS...
[04:31:01] <MPer> ravenzz, where is attr defined?
[04:31:08] <Cork> marsilainen: try to reduce the problem and if you can find a fairly small section that causes it, make a fiddle with it
[04:32:52] <marsilainen> Cork: will do
[04:32:55] <marsilainen> Cork: thanks
[04:32:58] <Cork> np

[04:34:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cork: you ever sleep?
[04:35:03] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: sure :)
[04:35:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> once a week?
[04:35:15] <frothnicator> apologies if this is a noob question (but I'm new to JS waters!): is there ever an issue of a race condition in JS?  I'm using jQuery to find elements attached to the DOM, but paying attention to the fact that JS in the browser is single threaded (right?!), I'm protecting a destructor function with 'if ( null !== this.element ) { return; } // already destructed.  However, /after/ that check, my scripts are seemingly randomly breaking because
[04:35:39] <Cork> na :) (interpret the meaning as you want)
[04:36:11] <frothnicator> bahh, that would be null '===', not '!=='.  That's a simple typo in the question, not my code.
[04:36:19] <Cork> frothnicator: when your stack runs you have no risk of race no
[04:36:34] <Cork> frothnicator: you CAN get race between async calls though
[04:36:46] <Cork> but that is the entire function call stack
[04:37:34] <frothnicator> Cork: ... okay.  So based on my $.get/$.post calls and done() methods, I /could/ have multiple threads running at the same time?
[04:37:52] <Cork> frothnicator: not threads
[04:38:14] <Cork> frothnicator: but the ajax callback depends on the speed of that specific tcp packet
[04:38:27] <Cork> frothnicator: so they are called "when they arrive"
[04:38:38] <tobago> I'm curious, because "jQuery(document).ready()" works, but "jQuery(document).on()" does NOT?
[04:38:45] <Cork> so they arn't guaranteed to happen in order
[04:38:56] <frothnicator> Cork: how does that work; does the browser queue them up, and the first one back gets executed until completion, etc.?
[04:39:22] <Cork> tobago: jQuery(document).ready()" and "jQuery(document).on('DOMContentLoaded')" should be fairly the same thing
[04:39:34] <Cork> frothnicator: except the "after it's been fired" part of ready
[04:39:39] <Cork> or the fallback to load
[04:40:08] <Cork> frothnicator: when you make an ajax call the calls are queued
[04:40:12] <tobago> Cork, it's so odd, that second returns:  "jQuery(...).on is not a function"
[04:40:22] <Cork> frothnicator: when your stack unwinds the browser makes the calls
[04:40:53] <Cork> frothnicator: and then it fires the callback handler as soon as the data arrives, and no js is running (the even queue is spun)
[04:41:22] <Cork> tobago: are you running this after the jquery load script tag?
[04:41:44] <tobago> Cork, yes. it is part of my app javascript.
[04:41:51] <Cork> the even== the event
[04:42:10] <Cork> tobago: sure, but make sure the script is loaded before you try to use it
[04:42:29] <Cork> tobago: ex. have the jquery script tag in head, before your script
[04:42:39] <tobago> the jQuery stuff is loaded first (Firebug say so)
[04:42:41] <Cork> (your script doesn't have to be in head)
[04:42:50] <Cork> ah
[04:42:51] <Cork> wait
[04:42:53] <MPer> ravenzz, strange, in the access funtion it returns the elements unmodified if chanable is true, and it is true because access is calles with chainable==true
[04:43:04] <frothnicator> Cork: okay, so boiling it down then, the 'if ( null === this.element ) ...' check /should/ be enough, then, no?
[04:43:14] <Cork> tobago: console.log(jQuery.fn.jquery)
[04:43:40] <Cork> frothnicator: not sure what your doing
[04:43:59] <Cork> frothnicator: so i can't say if it's needed/enough
[04:45:17] <frothnicator> Cork: heh.  roger.
[04:45:59] <Cork> (meaning if you want an answer you need to show some code)
[04:46:03] <doug65536> lesson learned: don't even bother with the official jquery logos. not sure what they were thinking with the microscopic "tagline" text under JQuery
[04:46:05] <frothnicator> Cork: yeap, I'm with you.
[04:46:25] <Cork> doug65536: sorry?
[04:46:37] <Cork> doug65536: logo for what?
[04:46:41] <doug65536> Cork: jquery
[04:46:44] <tobago> Cork, found it, this project is on jQuery 1.7.... sorry, for bothering you. thanks a lot.
[04:46:52] <tobago> is not on 1.7
[04:46:59] <Cork> tobago: thought so
[04:47:01] <tobago> it's still 1.6.2
[04:47:08] <tobago> fucking project...
[04:47:11] <Cork> :)
[04:47:14] <frothnicator> Cork: I'll have to boil it down to a JSFiddle worthy set of functions, and I don't currently appreciate JSFiddle's workflow.  I'm going to keep poking at locally first.  I was hoping it was something larger (or otherwise simple) that I was missing.
[04:47:15] <tobago> sorry
[04:47:23] <Cork> tobago: just use .delegate or .bind
[04:47:30] <Cork> they do the same thing as on
[04:48:58] <Cork> frothnicator: javascript/jquery is normally simple to work with until you have to handle things async, then it can become really messy
[04:49:00] <tobago> Cork, yep. alread ydid so, but wanted to use on... anyway
[04:49:09] <Cork> ^^
[04:49:44] <tobago> NEVER EVER continue an existing project.
[04:50:07] <Cork> tobago: or just update jquery :)
[04:50:27] <tobago> especially if the forerunner is complete idiot.
[04:50:32] <frothnicator> Cork: Well, it's for that exact reason that I adopted the organization of an MVC library.  I'm currently trying to implement my app with jQuery and CanJS.
[04:50:42] <Cork> as long as you don't fiddle with events it should work find (fiddle as in return false/stopPropagation)
[04:51:35] <Cork> frothnicator: i really don't like mvc outside of the server side
[04:51:42] <tobago> Cork, impossible. Because there is so much nasty ruby code, that is bound to outdated code. and at the end even the jQuery was frozen to 1.6.2. I only want to end this project somehow.
[04:52:02] <frothnicator> Cork: I /really/ like what CanJS advertises, and for about 90% of my app, it works beautifully.  However, I'm finding that it's still young as -- at least compared to jQuery --, I'm finding various corner cases.  (I'm not /that/ pathological a programmer, am I?)
[04:52:24] <frothnicator> Cork: oh.  My coding style tends to need it less with server side, and /way/ more with UI side.
[04:52:47] <tobago> Cork, hate backbone.js, angular.js or even ember.js? ;)
[04:53:16] <Cork> tobago: yes, cause they tend to push things into js
[04:53:36] <Cork> tobago: and they tend to push server work into the client (where it just becomes slow)
[04:53:37] <tobago> Cork, possible. depends on the developer.
[04:54:20] <Cork> tobago: if you look at how they market the libs that is the goal
[04:54:29] <tobago> Cork, I'll have to add offline functionality for an application. and then I'll tend to use MVC js lib.
[04:54:47] <mikunos> hi guys, is there a way to convert this list http://i2.minus.com/iZLoIdQu71SXZ.png into a dropdown?
[04:55:26] <Cork> mikunos: uh "yes"
[04:55:34] <Cork> it's called css
[04:55:57] <Cork> ot does all kinda of crazy things :)
[04:56:44] <rigel> so uh
[04:56:58] <rigel> i have my behavior exactly right when i click the button
[04:57:12] <rigel> but then it refreshes back to the original state for some reason
[04:57:47] <rigel> code is similar to http://jsfiddle.net/72b7w/2/
[04:59:46] <rigel> i get a flash of the explanation and the right/wrong and then it refreshes
[04:59:59] <MPer> Did I miss something while I had a disconn?
[05:00:28] <Cork> rigel: the fiddle runs in onload
[05:00:36] <Cork> rigel: move it to head
[05:01:01] <Cork> MPer: nope
[05:01:06] <MPer> Can anyone explain to me where the function jQuery.fn.extend gets the parameter 'arguments' from?
[05:01:15] <marsilainen> ok, so after some more testing of this, it's not doing what I thought at all... what is actually happening is that my on-submit handler never seems to get called at all, despite me having bound it to the submit event of the form
[05:01:20] <rigel> Cork: no different behavior in head
[05:01:21] <Cork> MPer: it's built into javascript
[05:01:41] <MPer> The call inside is using it: return jQuery.access( this, jQuery.attr, name, value, arguments.length > 1 );
[05:01:53] <MPer> Cork, what is arguments?
[05:01:57] <Cork> js> function a() { print(JSON.stringify(arguments)); }; a(1,2,3,4,5,6,7);
[05:02:07] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[05:02:13] <Cork> O_o
[05:02:17] * Cork kicks b-ot 
[05:02:30] <joland9> does anyone know where i can find a sample to do some test with crossdomain with json/jquery?
[05:02:37] <MPer> Cork, ohh, I see
[05:02:42] <Cork> MPer: it is an array like thingy that lists all the arguments passed to the function
[05:02:56] <doug65536> Cork: semicolon?
[05:03:19] <Cork> doug65536: no that should be there
[05:03:27] <doug65536> Cork: function statement though
[05:03:45] <Cork> doug65536: well it is allowed/implied
[05:03:59] <Cork> js> function a() { print("works?"); }; a(1,2,3,4,5,6,7);
[05:04:07] <b-ot> Cork: works?
[05:04:15] * Cork really don't like b-ot 
[05:04:30] <marsilainen> I'm an idiot
[05:04:41] <marsilainen> I had:   <form id="#foo"....
[05:04:56] <doug65536> marsilainen: I think we've all made that mistake
[05:05:23] <Cork> ya, and you always think your an idiot when you find a fairly simple mistake you've been hunting for hours
[05:05:35] <Cork> funny enough it happens to most developers :)
[05:06:13] <marsilainen> maybe the IDE could warn about it somehow
[05:06:35] <doug65536> marsilainen: technically, $('\\#foo') would find it
[05:06:40] <Cork> i remember one time a few years back when i spent almost a full work day debugging why ie didn't work (script failed with a bogus line number)
[05:06:49] <doug65536> oops, missing #
[05:07:10] <doug65536> $('#\\#foo')
[05:07:17] <marsilainen> doug65536: sure, I realise it could probably be valid, but probably not good practise :)
[05:07:21] <Cork> and  finally found i had [val,val,val,val,val,] >_<''''
[05:07:25] <doug65536> marsilainen: of course
[05:07:31] <marsilainen> doug65536: so a warning at least would be good (not an error)
[05:07:40] <Cork> marsilainen: agreed
[05:07:57] <MPer> ravenz, are you here?
[05:08:01] <Cork> same should go for using [] in id's
[05:08:20] <doug65536> and .
[05:08:24] <Cork> ya
[05:08:44] <Cork> and actually any valid css relation character
[05:09:19] <MPer> Ohh! b.fn.attr is from tinymce! tinymce is interferring here.
[05:09:38] <Cork> MPer: yay... lovely
[05:10:41] <doug65536> MPer: if I were you I would make it even more tiny, like, zero bytes, because I deleted it :)
[05:10:42] <MPer> Cork: geez! I really should update to tinymce 4
[05:10:55] <Cork> :)
[05:11:22] <MPer> doug65536, I would, just because I hate it now. But unfortunately I need am extensible text editor here
[05:11:58] <doug65536> MPer: well, there is a workaround if you *had* to
[05:12:03] <Cork> MPer: not to say you should go that way; but i looked at tinymce and fkceditor (before it renamed to kceditor)
[05:12:27] <Cork> MPer: and i picked kceditor cause it's code base was less intrusive and flexible
[05:12:41] <MPer> Cork, was that tinymce 3 or 4?
[05:12:52] <Cork> think it was like 2 actually
[05:12:58] <Cork> this was many years ago
[05:13:02] <MPer> Cork, uh...
[05:13:40] <doug65536> MPer: before loading it, do var realAttr = $.fn.attr; then after loading it, do $.fn.realattr = realAttr;    super ugly but if you really had to that would work. then $(selector).realAttr should run jquery attr
[05:14:24] <MPer> doug65536, the problem is that not I do call attr, jQuery UI is
[05:14:24] <Cork> or just poke the developers and ask why they are breaking the core jquery function
[05:15:49] <doug65536> what does event.cancelable mean?
[05:16:18] <doug65536> does it mean event.preventDefault() is supposed to work?
[05:16:20] <Cork> doug65536: if the event can be prevented
[05:16:22] <Cork> yes
[05:16:28] <doug65536> hmm, jquery lies then
[05:16:40] <Cork> should be dom native value
[05:16:46] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/wdvyQ/9/
[05:16:48] <Cork> ?g mdn event cancelable
[05:16:49] <b-ot> Cork: event.cancelable - Web API interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/event.cancelable
[05:17:16] <doug65536> the popstate handler's event parameter has event.cancelable = true - but it doesn't cancel if I event.preventDefault()
[05:17:33] <Cork> doug65536: well you can prevent the popState event
[05:17:50] <Cork> doug65536: but you can't prevent the change of the history :)
[05:18:03] <doug65536> lol, what does that even mean?
[05:18:29] <Cork> doug65536: the url is already changed, so prevent won't affect that, it has already happened
[05:18:47] <Cork> doug65536: it like preventDefault() on load would revert back to the old page
[05:19:10] <doug65536> ah, so it is cancelable because canceling it is nonsense anyway
[05:19:15] <Cork> doug65536: though, yes i agree there should be a way to handle this but popstate is not the place
[05:19:20] <Cork> doug65536: yes
[05:19:33] <Cork> doug65536: there are a few events you can't cancel, like unload
[05:19:51] <Cork> and to some degree beforeunload
[05:28:41] <MPer> Is there a way to get the z-index of an object?
[05:29:34] <doug65536> MPer: .css('z-index')
[05:29:53] <MPer> doug65536, thanks
[05:30:02] <doug65536> MPer: hmm, wait
[05:30:02] <Cork> that only gives you the value though, not the full page z-index
[05:31:22] <doug65536> Cork: it seems it doesn't even give the value
[05:31:31] <Cork> it does if it is set inline
[05:31:42] <doug65536> Cork: it doesn't for me
[05:32:02] <doug65536> $('h1').first().css('z-index', 34); var x = $('h1').first().css('z-index');        <-- x = "auto"
[05:32:53] <Cork> doug65536: http://jsfiddle.net/z5z87/
[05:32:58] <doug65536> and I checked, that element now has style="z-index: 34"
[05:33:11] <Cork> is the element position relative or absolute?
[05:33:22] <doug65536> ah, lol, yeah. sorry
[05:33:52] <Cork> doug65536: actually it works as a class too http://jsfiddle.net/z5z87/1/
[05:34:09] <doug65536> Cork: yeah, try it when it is position: static
[05:34:16] <doug65536> I know, I know...
[05:34:21] <Cork> ya, it's expected :)
[05:38:24] <MPer> geez... that tinymce dialog has a z-index of 65536
[05:38:37] <Cork> lol
[05:38:39] <Cork> lovely
[05:38:53] <doug65536> MPer: yeah, silly. everyone thinks "yeah but I want to be SUPER-DUPER on top
[05:39:00] <Cork> MPer: that is basically the top value
[05:39:45] <doug65536> I do my z-index like ancient BASIC programming, increments of about 10 or so... so I can squeeze in between if I ever need to
[05:40:10] <Cork> :)
[05:42:18] <MPer> The problem is, that the insert image dialog calls my own filemanager dilog
[05:42:24] <MPer> and it is behind...
[05:55:04] <Kaylors> Have an AJAX question. How do I make my function wait till a response has been received and only then return?
[05:55:25] <doug65536> Kaylors: please don't do that
[05:55:26] <jp-> use async: false
[05:55:32] <jp-> but, yeah, what doug65536 said.
[05:55:45] <Kaylors> But I need it to.
[05:56:08] <jp-> try to design around the async behavior instead of forcing it to be synchronous.
[05:56:14] <dAnjou> Kaylors: do you want to do long polling?
[05:56:26] <Kaylors> I am writing an AJAX request to test if the username entered already exists.
[05:56:44] <Kaylors> -total noob so doesn't know what you mean by long-polling-
[05:56:52] <pepijndevos> $.ajax supports setting a username and password for basic auth, but it is only set if the server returns 401 it seems. How can I set it regardlesly?
[05:56:52] <dAnjou> then nevermind
[05:56:58] <doug65536> Kaylors: ok, so do it async, when the response comes back, update the UI
[05:57:05] <doug65536> Kaylors: in the callback
[05:57:20] <jp-> pick up execution in your success: function() { } event handler
[05:58:00] <Cork> Kaylors: there are two big reasons not to use synchronous ajax calls
[05:58:14] <Cork> 1. it is in legacy mode, so it doesn't get new features
[05:58:19] <Kaylors> dough65536: My design is this. When the submit button is clicked, an AJAX request is made to check for the username. If the username exists, submitting is prevented and a message is displayed to the effect. If the username does not exist, form submitting is allowed to proceed.
[05:58:43] <Cork> 2. the browser will actually freeze until the server response gets back
[05:58:54] <Cork> resulting in really bad experience for the user
[05:59:12] <Kaylors> Cork: When you say browser will freeze, you mean other tabs as well?
[05:59:13] <jp-> some browsers will prompt to terminate execution of the script after n seconds as well.
[05:59:30] <Cork> Kaylors: so always prevent the submittion, and when the ajax all comes back submit the form if it's valid
[05:59:36] <dAnjou> Kaylors: use javascript *only* for assisting the user, not to prevent anything because effectively it can't
[06:00:02] <Kaylors> Cork: So I should just grey out the submit button till conditions are met?
[06:00:18] <Cork> $('form').on('submit', function(event) { var form = this; event.preventDefault(); $.ajax().done(function() { form.submit(); }); });
[06:00:25] <dAnjou> Kaylors: you should check that in server side anyway
[06:00:28] <jp-> don't use a submit button, use a regular button and submit the form via javascript when all conditions are met.
[06:00:29] <Cork> Kaylors: or show an overlay or what ever you like
[06:00:57] <Cork> Kaylors: and yes you still need to check it again from the submitted data
[06:01:13] <Cork> (as you can't depend on js to make the validation)
[06:01:16] <Narhir> hi is there a easy way to create something like "if this element have class of .something" add .something2 to differently element"
[06:01:17] <jp-> if you don't use a submit button you don't have to worry about the browser automatically submitting the form when clicked, but you can return false from the event handler for the submit button as well to prevent form submission.
[06:01:45] <Kaylors> Alright, thanks everyone. I've only been doing this for a few weeks so have a lot to learn. I'll be coming back here a lot. Cheers and thank you.
[06:01:54] <doug65536> jp-: you can and should use a submit button, just use event.preventDefault() in the on-submit handler
[06:02:06] <Cork> Narhir: if($(target2).hasClass('something') { $(target1).addClass('something2'); }
[06:02:11] <doug65536> jp-: if your code path doesn't want to allow the submit
[06:02:14] <Cork> Narhir: * if($(target2).hasClass('something')) { $(target1).addClass('something2'); }
[06:05:13] <ravenz> MPer sorry man, I am quite busy. I'll be back later
[06:05:35] <MPer> ravenz, not a problem at all
[06:09:05] <Narhir> thank you Cork ! :)
[06:33:38] <jonclark> hi #jquery, i'm trying to create a behaviour that mimics gmail/gdrive where you can shift click to select multiple rows, even when clicking the row's body and not just the checkbox. test case here: http://jsfiddle.net/Ucuaw/ - when clicking the div and holding shift, i can't communicate to the checkbox's click handler that the shiftkey was being held down. anything obvious jump out
[06:33:38] <jonclark>  at you that i'm messing up here?
[06:34:30] <jonclark> i'm trying to pass the event info as an extra param, as shown here: http://api.jquery.com/trigger/#trigger-event-extraParameters
[06:35:00] <Velveeta> jonclark: the event object has a field that will tell you if the shift key is being held down
[06:35:18] <jonclark> but it's coming back undefined. also read up on e.originalEvent but that seems to exist no matter how the click is being triggered, whether it's a direct click on the checkbox or it's a click on the div that triggers the checkbox click
[06:35:40] <Velveeta> can you post something to jsfiddle to demonstrate this?
[06:35:44] <jonclark> yea Velveeta i'm aware of that property
[06:35:45] <jonclark> and i did.
[06:35:50] <Velveeta> oh yeah there it is
[06:36:15] <jonclark> it's breaking because i'm not passing extra parameters properly, let me comment that bit out.
[06:36:33] <jonclark> http://jsfiddle.net/Ucuaw/1/
[06:37:22] <jonclark> shiftkey detection works fine when clicking the checkboxes directly, and you can see what i'm trying to do (in comments) to pass that info to the checkbox's click handler when the parent div is clicked
[06:39:37] <Narhir> ehh
[06:39:39] <Narhir> I'm so silly
[06:39:41] <Velveeta> ok, so one thing you can do is to find your input and .trigger(e)
[06:39:46] <Narhir> my code doesnt work and its probably its entirly wrong
[06:39:47] <Narhir> http://jsfiddle.net/KC3c3/3/
[06:40:00] <Velveeta> and that should use the original event object as the event object for your input, including the extra data (shiftKey)
[06:40:20] <Velveeta> you can also try wrapping your custom object {event: e} in an array wrapper: [{event: e}]
[06:40:49] <jonclark> ok, so instead of .trigger('click') pass the entire event object w/ .trigger(e) ?
[06:41:59] <Velveeta> yepyep
[06:44:03] <t4nk245> hi
[06:44:28] <t4nk245> something expert in jquery chainning callback asp.net-mvc-4?
[06:45:37] <t4nk245> i need help related to chaining callback
[06:45:57] <t4nk245> if someone can help me i highly appreciate
[06:46:51] <jonclark> t4nk245, !ask
[06:46:59] <jonclark> err what is it again
[06:47:04] <jonclark> t4nk245 ?ask
[06:47:11] <jonclark> i forget lol... just ask the question, someone will help
[06:47:17] <nisseni> I'm having an image and a radiobutton inside a label. Tapping the image will check the radiobutton, now I want the border-color to toggle on the image depending on checked = true / false - I just can't figure out how to do this
[06:47:21] <t4nk245> i have some piece of code
[06:47:36] <t4nk245> but to post here is difficult
[06:47:39] <nisseni> I'm triggering it by "change" on the radiobutton
[06:47:46] <jonclark> use jsfiddle.net, t4nk245
[06:48:44] <jonclark> nisseni, in the radiobutton's change event handler, do if ($(this).is(":checked")) { ... add css class to your img } else { remove css class }
[06:49:53] <Cork> or just $(target).toggleClass('', $(this).is(":checked"))
[06:49:53] <jonclark> Velveeta, using .trigger(e) doesn't seem to send anything extra to the checkbox's click handler
[06:50:10] <Velveeta> is your fiddle example updated?
[06:50:17] <jonclark> one sec i'll upd
[06:50:29] <Velveeta> ok
[06:51:09] <jonclark> http://jsfiddle.net/Ucuaw/2/
[06:51:50] <sekyms> Anyone know any NON SAAS agile management tools?
[06:52:01] <Radditz> hello
[06:52:05] <nisseni> jonclark: yeah, so far so good, but it's two radiobuttons with the same name, so the otherone has to lose the class, and this doesn't seem to work
[06:52:18] <Radditz> what is the equivalent in jquery of document.getElementById('foo').innerHTML = "sometext"
[06:52:20] <Radditz> thak you
[06:52:23] <Radditz> thank you
[06:52:40] <jonclark> $("#foo").html(stuff)
[06:53:06] <Radditz> I see, if I have a paragraph should I use html or text ?
[06:53:14] <Radditz> thank you jonclark
[06:53:35] <Velveeta> jonclark: hmm, that's definitely some weird behavior… you can't even get e.originalEvent.shiftKey to read properly
[06:53:50] <nisseni> jonclark: I'm thinking that there are actually two radiobuttons with the same class that changes, is this right?
[06:53:52] <Velveeta> sekyms: post-its!
[06:53:57] <jonclark> Radditz, if you're inserting rich text into that paragraph you'll want to use html() so that tags are preserved
[06:54:24] <Velveeta> jonclark: i'll try tracking it to the bowels of jquery and see where it's discarding that data
[06:54:24] <Radditz> jonclark: I am inserting simple text , and I would prefer to have it escaped so users can't inject html and break the paragraph
[06:54:39] <jonclark> Radditz, text() then :)
[06:54:48] <t4nk245> I have some problems with callbacks I provide a link where I describe my problem and what i pretend to do, if someone call help me i highly appreciate, below the link: http://forums.asp.net/t/1938263.aspx?Parsing+incorrectly+json+data
[06:54:55] <nisseni> jonclark: here's the code: http://pastie.org/private/vnr4865wrcf1biafoo4w
[06:55:01] <Radditz> thank you jonclark , sorry about the stupid questions, I am rather new to javascript
[06:55:06] <Radditz> and dom manipulation and such
[06:55:19] <jonclark> nisseni, you'll want to change the class on the image, and make sure you're targeting the image that's the sibling of the radio button that's being checked
[06:55:32] <jonclark> ah, which you are doing
[06:55:32] <Radditz> why does jquery prefix ids with # ?
[06:55:38] <jonclark> same as CSS, Radditz
[06:55:55] <Velveeta> radditz: because it's based on css syntax for its selector engine?
[06:55:56] <nisseni> jonclark: yes indeed, but the class isn't toggled off when I select the other one
[06:55:58] <Radditz> jonclark: I don't know the reason personally, why in pure javascript I can't ?
[06:56:05] <Cork> Radditz: cause it mainly uses document.querySelectorAll
[06:56:07] <Radditz> are there other characters than # ?
[06:56:24] <Velveeta> sure, you could say [id="myId"] instead of #myId
[06:56:31] <Velveeta> but that's even more verbose
[06:56:33] <Cork> Velveeta: that isn't the same thing
[06:56:43] <Cork> that is an attribute selector, not an id selector
[06:56:43] <Velveeta> plus, if you have more than 1 item w/ that id, it'll return both
[06:56:54] <Radditz> oh I see, it's a real query language?
[06:56:58] <Radditz> it's xpath ?
[06:57:06] <Cork> Radditz: you can do $(document.getElementById('something')) if you prefer
[06:57:12] <Velveeta> cork: i know it is, i just assumed he was asking "is there another way to grab my element by this id without using the hash tag"
[06:57:14] <Cork> Radditz: css selectors
[06:57:22] <Radditz> Cork: is it a subset of xpath?
[06:57:26] <Cork> no
[06:57:26] <Velveeta> no
[06:57:26] <Radditz> or not related to it?
[06:57:28] <Radditz> ok
[06:57:32] <Radditz> thank you guys
[06:57:40] <Cork> Radditz: it is the same engine the browser uses for stylecheets
[06:57:48] <Cork> Radditz: it is several times faster then xpath
[06:57:52] <jonclark> Velveeta, btw, i tried looking at e.originalEvent but seems to exist no matter how the checkbox click handler is triggered
[06:57:53] <Radditz> well my CSS knowledge is basic, I have just a few rules
[06:58:09] <jonclark> i thought that would be the easiest solution
[06:58:13] <Radditz> I dont even recall using css selectors, I made rules and applied them
[06:58:32] <Cork> Radditz: you mean you never use .css files?
[06:58:43] <irkaacis> I am losing my mind - why the hell could browser say that my jquery object ( $('#submit_task') ) doesnt have a fancybox method ? All files properly included in head and eveything else seems fine to me.
[06:58:57] <Radditz> Cork: not at work, and I dont do web dev at home for pleasure/hobby either
[06:59:09] <Cork> Radditz: that is kinda scary
[06:59:22] <Radditz> Cork:  the code I write is going to be called from another webpage, dynamically depending on where it's at , I am forced to inject styles myself
[07:00:05] <Radditz> last I checked you can't include styles outside head?
[07:00:06] <jonclark> nisseni, before the if() in your code, you'll want to remove the border class from all other images
[07:00:07] <Cork> Radditz: still doesn't really matter
[07:00:14] <Cork> Radditz: you can
[07:00:26] <Cork> Radditz: it was invalid until a few years back
[07:00:27] <jonclark> nisseni, then just do .addClass on the sibling img within the if() block
[07:00:45] <Radditz> Except sometimes I can't provide a css file, I provide a java class that is going to be called to render a certain component
[07:00:45] <jonclark> nisseni, had to think about it a bit more, i get what you're trying to do now :)
[07:00:48] <Radditz> I dont use CSS much anyway
[07:01:19] <Cork> Radditz: are you using inline styles instead or how are you defining the look of the page?
[07:01:40] <Cork> Radditz: or are you using... <font> and similar? (wish he gets a no)
[07:01:57] <irkaacis> javascript is shutting my butt down
[07:02:00] <Radditz> Cork: I use inline styles when I have to use styles
[07:02:20] <Cork> Radditz: then you should definitely learn to move that into a separate file
[07:02:24] <jonclark> irkaacis if you can post url to your broken page someone might be able to help
[07:02:25] <Cork> Radditz: makes life much easier
[07:03:06] <Radditz> Cork: as I've said the project I work with has to support older browsers and it's a mess and such, and I don't have to use it often anyway
[07:03:31] <Cork> Radditz: well that is one of the things that becomes less of a mess ;)
[07:03:37] <Cork> (supporting older browsers)
[07:04:01] <Velveeta> jonclark: found your problem
[07:04:10] <jonclark> Velveeta, hit me
[07:04:21] <Velveeta> jquery-1.9.1.js, line 3246
[07:04:32] <jonclark> :o
[07:04:44] <Velveeta> looks like for trigger, if it's specifically an input type, and is a checkbox, and the event type is click
[07:04:59] <Velveeta> it triggers a generic click on it, without passing any data, it just discards what you're passing
[07:05:13] <jonclark> wow, great find, and how on earth did you find that?
[07:05:21] <Velveeta> a lotta breakpoints :D
[07:05:25] <ashgotti> Hello all. I'm trying to use jquery mobile ui and a jquery virtual keyboard but the keyboard uses a different version of jquery and doesn't seem to work. How can I go about making it compatible?
[07:05:26] <jonclark> u crazy man
[07:05:50] <jonclark> wonder if it works with jquery latest...
[07:06:28] <jonclark> hmm nope
[07:06:34] <Velveeta> it's possible, but if not, you may be able to get around it by calling something like .find('input')[0].click(e)
[07:07:03] <Velveeta> it won't work the exact same way as the jquery triggered event, but i *think* it may receive your passed event as its 2nd parameter, *maybe*
[07:07:35] <kpl> If I have <div id="1">ABC<input type="text" /></div>, then how do  I select the text ABC only to replace it?
[07:08:04] <Velveeta> jonclark: the other way to handle this would be to put a delegated click event on your div, and let that be the only handler for this
[07:08:10] <Cork> kpl: that is tricky to do with dom, as it tries hard to hide text element
[07:08:22] <Cork> kpl: best option is to add a <span> around the text and use that
[07:08:28] <kpl> OK, thanks
[07:08:34] <jonclark> Velveeta, i think i might have to go that route
[07:08:39] <Velveeta> the click should bubble up from the checkbox when someone clicks it, so you don't need to programmatically tell the checkbox it's been clicked, and similarly, anywhere else in the div that the person clicks will trigger it
[07:08:43] <Cork> kpl: alternatively you have to fiddle around with looping text nodes and using that
[07:08:52] <Cork> (not recommended)
[07:08:58] <jonclark> Velveeta because still nothing is being passed
[07:08:58] <Velveeta> and then just check for a shiftKey at the div level and go trigger the click event on any other divs in between them
[07:09:03] <Velveeta> gotcha
[07:09:32] <jonclark> thank you very much for the help! :)
[07:10:07] <Velveeta> no problemo :) jquery victory dance: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sp9xfM6SSTI
[07:13:19] <jonclark> Velveeta, related (possibly): http://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/1.9/#checkbox-radio-state-in-a-trigger-ed-click-event
[07:13:55] <jonclark> i think the clearing of passed data probably has something to do with this behaviour
[07:14:21] <Velveeta> yep, it's absolutely related, because that's close to what the comment on that if-block said
[07:15:23] <Velveeta> so maybe you should also bind your listener to a 'change' event instead of click
[07:15:38] <Velveeta> since their desired behavior for click on a checkbox should be that it shows you the current state of the box, and not the to-be state
[07:17:32] <jonclark> hmm, 'change' makes things kinda worse, any my head hurts, i'm just going to re-write with delegate()
[07:17:42] <jonclark> but at least i know to be wary of checkboxes from now on :)
[07:17:54] <Velveeta> as do i
[07:17:54] <torbjorn> how can I search upwards for the first parent element wit ha given tag?
[07:18:04] <kpl> Can I do $("div#1 .A div#label") to select a div with id="label" which is a child of a div with class="A" which is a child of a div with id="1"?
[07:18:05] <jonclark> torbjorn, .closest()
[07:18:51] <jonclark> kpl in theory, but IDs and Classes must start with a letter
[07:19:27] <kpl> I see, thanks.
[07:19:38] <torbjorn> thanks!
[07:20:11] <jonclark> just keep in mind that the longer your selectors are for event handlers, the more resources it will take. if you are going to attach handlers to a lot of elements, look into delegate()
[07:20:26] <Radditz> does anyone want to play the question mark game?
[07:21:07] <jonclark> ?
[07:21:07] <torbjorn> jonclark: im searching upward for one <fieldset> that contains a group of checkboxes that i want to use with .buttonset()
[07:22:13] <jonclark> wrap those checkboxes in a class or give them a class, then you can select with .closest('fieldset:has(.specialboxes)')
[07:22:50] <RLa> is this behavior documented somewhere: http://jsfiddle.net/2ZtLS/
[07:22:54] <RLa> i expect 2
[07:25:27] <torbjorn> jonclark: is it better to use class than for example name?
[07:27:27] <agsel> hey. I have a WordPress site and NGG gallery plugin. there are some problems with loading stuff. and now it has come down to that, that $(document).ready() id not firing. any idea, why that can happen?
[07:28:32] <novoa> the script is broken
[07:29:13] <agsel> is there any way to find out which one? I have tried firebug, it doesn't show anything important
[07:29:15] <boytoy> doug65536: cool awesome
[07:29:51] <novoa> test each module individually
[07:30:06] <novoa> try another browser
[07:30:21] <agsel> it's the same in different browsers
[07:30:44] <NoiseEee> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 @ agsel
[07:30:47] <boytoy> doug65536: much more rewarding learning two ways of doing the same thing though, besides without your fiddle i wouldn't have made that native deferred discovery
[07:31:35] <doug65536> boytoy: yeah, js is already amazing at async, adding deferred and $.when makes it insanely good
[07:31:36] <novoa> remove() ing input nodes just empties them, someone seem something similar?
[07:33:33] <agsel> novoa: should there be like a warning/error on the console, if the script was broken?
[07:34:45] <novoa> agsel:  sometimes you get nothing at all..
[07:35:10] <novoa> is it too much code? can you post it?
[07:38:42] <doug65536> agsel: not necessarily - a try/catch might hide it. it's not likely that some code swallowed an exception though
[07:39:22] <doug65536> novoa: never seen .remove not work
[07:39:26] <Velveeta> also it depends on if it's a logical or syntactical error
[07:39:28] <agsel> novoa: yes, it's too much code. that's why I try other options than turning off scripts/modules
[07:39:36] <Velveeta> a logical error won't show you anything, it just won't work right
[07:39:45] <Velveeta> but yeah, i've never seen remove not work either
[07:40:41] <agsel> doug65536: I think there's no catch. it's just waiting for something. the timeline shows some function call after certain period of time, but this should not alter the ready state. and if I check the readyState of the document, it's says "completed"
[07:40:46] <kpl> jonclark: ids consisting of just numbers seem to work for me with jQuery 1.2.6 in Firefox 24.0.
[07:41:09] <kpl> But maybe it won't work as things get more complex..
[07:41:12] <agsel> I'm not sure readyState and ready() represent the same stuff. but it would be locgical
[07:42:16] <doug65536> agsel: document ready won't fire if jquery isn't loaded (yet) when it executes that $(document).ready code
[07:43:44] <doug65536> agsel: if I were you I would add a line right before that: debugger;    have your debugger active, and reload the page. when it breaks there, type this in the console: $
[07:44:13] <doug65536> agsel: you might find that it isn't even executing that line that you think it is
[07:48:23] <agsel> doug65536: it gives me something like function (e,t){return new x.fn.init(e,t,r)}
[07:48:46] <agsel> doug65536: for the jQuery (when debugging and just before the jQuery(document).ready()
[07:49:22] <doug65536> agsel: try $.fn.ready
[07:49:42] <doug65536> agsel: if that dumps a function, you definitely have jquery there
[07:50:27] <agsel> doug65536: function (e){return x.ready.promise().done(e...
[07:50:38] <agsel> that was jQuery.fn.ready
[07:51:02] <doug65536> agsel: ok, you have jquery there then, let it run
[07:52:53] <agsel> doug65536: document.readyState gives me "complete" after the page load. but ready() has not been run
[07:53:58] <doug65536> agsel: what do you mean by $(document).ready() is not firing. you have a callback function in those last () right?
[07:54:19] <agsel> yes function() {alert(1);}
[07:54:55] <agsel> doug65536: yes, see above
[07:55:39] <agsel> doug65536: it worked like 2 weeks ago. but then someone decided to upgrade jquery and jquery-ui
[07:56:11] <doug65536> agsel: it is implausible for that to not work. it's probably the most thoroughly used thing in the entire jquery
[07:56:35] <agsel> but I guess the document won't get ready
[07:56:50] <BillCriswell> I always assumed the document was a lady.
[07:57:01] <agsel> there are like hundreds of scripts executed in WP. I probably should check all of them (or first disable all of them)
[07:57:29] <boytoy> doug65536: getting there: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/UmV9Y/8/
[07:58:13] <agsel> I just hoped I will get some information which script is preventing document of getting ready
[07:58:52] <doug65536> agsel: I doubt that it is possible to prevent the document becoming ready
[07:59:17] <doug65536> agsel: which version of jquery?
[07:59:29] <nisseni> I want to iterate thru a json object that has arrays, the name of the object is "options" and it has two arrays (AttributeOption and ProductImage), now I want to iterate thru AttributeOption with $.each() - what's the syntax for this?
[07:59:37] <agsel> doug65536: 1.10.2
[08:00:28] <doug65536> nisseni: $.each(options.AttributeOption, function(k,v) { ... each time this runs, k is the index 0, 1, 2, etc, v is the value of that index ... });
[08:01:22] <doug65536> nisseni: I say 'k' because if it were an object, it would be the key (the property name)
[08:01:31] <nisseni> doug65536: that's what I'm doing, but I get: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[08:01:50] <doug65536> nisseni: then AttributeOption is undefined
[08:02:36] <nisseni> doug65536: http://pastie.org/private/hlg4vy4v1jowc0sqdvdfew
[08:02:48] <doug65536> boytoy: that deferred is scoped to the each callback. it won't exist by the time it gets to deferred.done
[08:03:25] <doug65536> boytoy: also, each call to embedly will overwrite the last value stored to deferred
[08:05:20] <boytoy> doug65536: should i reimplement your "deferreds" var outside the each?
[08:05:53] <doug65536> boytoy: not sure... I'm trying something in the fiddle
[08:09:03] <agsel> doug65536: I guess I found the problem. I have several $(document).ready() calls
[08:09:16] <agsel> doug65536: the first one is executed, but the rest are not
[08:09:25] <doug65536> agsel: there's no limit to the number of document.ready
[08:09:45] <agsel> doug65536: but if I removed the first one, then my problematic ready() is called
[08:10:00] <doug65536> agsel: an uncaught exception will cause the browser to abandon execution though
[08:10:20] <doug65536> agsel: do you get *any* errors in the console? you can't ignore any errors. every error is very bad
[08:10:39] <agsel> doug65536: no errors
[08:10:50] <doug65536> agsel: is the console set to show "all" ?
[08:11:19] <agsel> doug65536: yes, tried FF, chrome. the same
[08:11:19] <doug65536> boytoy: this one is easier to look at than the earlier one http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/UmV9Y/10/
[08:11:40] <agsel> doug65536: I guess I found an error. started removing lines. datepicker cases problems
[08:11:57] <boytoy> doug65536: it sure is, cheers mate
[08:12:18] <agsel> doug65536: $(...).datepicker(). strange it doesn't show anything
[08:12:32] <doug65536> nisseni: where did that stuff from line 5 onward come from ?
[08:12:55] <nisseni> doug65536: I make a post that returns json
[08:13:04] <nisseni> doug65536: that's the json result
[08:13:05] <agsel> doug65536: thanks for the tips. I guess I can handle it now :)
[08:13:09] <doug65536> nisseni: yeah, but that's not json
[08:13:20] <nisseni> doug65536: it's chromes interpretation of json :)
[08:13:33] <agsel> doug65536: ended up copying the whole html source and played with that. it's hard to find where stuff gets generated into output document in wordpress
[08:14:59] <doug65536> nisseni: it would be helpful to see the actual json. if that really is a representation of the json, what you have is an array of objects, and each object has one property called AttributeOption, and each of those is an object with an id and value property. That is a very poor layout for the (json) data
[08:15:59] <doug65536> nisseni: where does that come from?
[08:16:13] <nisseni> json_encode in php
[08:18:38] <miCSu> hm, is there some known issue with .load on images? I've got an image inside a div that's absolutely positioned in $(document).ready but it's not working in a page containing huge amount of data
[08:20:14] <doug65536> nisseni: it would make way more sense to have it more like this: json_encode(array('AttributeOption' => array('7' => 'Gron', '11' => 'Vit', ... etc ...), 'ProductImage' => array('243' => '8bi9i...', '247' => '5m...')))
[08:20:27] <BillCriswell> miCSu: I don't understand how any of that is connected.
[08:20:29] <nisseni> doug65536: yeah, remaking it that way now
[08:24:11] <myth> hey guys ..
[08:24:38] <myth> I want to make a page look like voxmedia.com ... not sure whether we can do it using jquery or not ..
[08:25:01] <myth> i want to scroll page and make it look like a curtain ..
[08:25:28] <myth> once the complete page is scrolled up then only next page start moving
[08:25:36] <myth> any suggestion is really helpful ..
[08:31:40] <doug65536> myth: that 2nd part is position: fixed, until the $(document).scrollTop() reaches a certain point, where it becomes position: relative and an appropriate 'top' is set with .css - and/or it uses a breakpoint plugin to handle some of that
[08:32:45] <doug65536> myth: it also uses a z-index on the 2nd part to put it behind the top thing
[08:32:54] <doug65536> or vice versa
[08:33:09] <doug65536> myth: that's mostly css tricks
[08:33:29] <myth> ok .. thanks a lot .. any tutorial or link where i can get some idea .. i am new to jquery .. only playing with basic ideas
[08:34:00] <myth> thanks a lot for quick help ..
[08:34:41] <doug65536> myth: I would use $(window).on('scroll', ...) to monitor scrolling, .css(...) to change styles based on the scroll offset that I get from $(window).scrollTop()
[08:35:01] <doug65536> myth: http://jqapi.com/
[08:36:14] <myth> <doug65536>: Thanks a lot .. let me try this .. and get back here ...
[08:36:22] <myth> Really thanks for your help ..
[08:53:43] <t4nk245> I have update from jquery 1.7.1 to 1.10.2 and now i have a problem on  jquery.unobstrusive-ajax.js
[08:53:51] <doug65536> myth http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/ywnrQ/2/
[08:54:02] <doug65536> lol
[08:54:29] <t4nk245> with .live
[08:54:34] <t4nk245> how to solve this?
[08:54:58] <devinus> what is the jquery method to attach to all elements that match a selector for the life of the page?
[08:55:03] <devinus> e.g. when new ones are added too
[08:55:16] <doug65536> devinus: .on with a selector in the second parameter
[08:55:22] <BillCriswell> devinus: You'd want to use .on().
[08:55:22] <t4nk245>     $("a[data-ajax=true]").live("click", function (evt) {         evt.preventDefault();         asyncRequest(this, {             url: this.href,             type: "GET",             data: []         });     });
[08:55:38] <doug65536> devinus: and before the .on is something that is a parent of everything you want to catch events for
[08:55:55] <BillCriswell> $('body').on('click', '.dynamic-or-static', doThings);
[08:56:21] <BillCriswell> Body can and probably should be a closer parent.
[08:57:10] <doug65536> t4nk245: then it would be something like $('body').on('click', 'a[data-ajax=true]', ...)
[08:57:26] <doug65536> t4nk245: ... is what you already have
[08:59:01] <devinus> thanks doug65536 and BillCriswell
[08:59:08] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:05:44] <raisdead> Is there a function similar to map but retains the same keys on objects?
[09:09:34] <raisdead> Sample usage: {"a":2} === $.omap({"a":1},function(value, key) {return value + 1});
[09:11:57] <BillCriswell> raisdead: Hmmmm... I'm thinking a loop might be the easiest way?
[09:14:28] <raisdead> BillCriswell: It is such a common thing to do, I just figured that a function would exist.
[09:15:22] <doug65536> raisdead: var result = {}; $.each(input, function(k,v) { result[k] = v + 1; })
[09:15:29] <doug65536> ;
[09:20:08] <raisdead> doug:65536 That is exactly the way I implemened my version of omap. I guess I just wanted something that would return the result rather than mutable state.
[09:20:25] <raisdead> I can just just roll my own.
[09:20:51] <doug65536> raisdead: your own will just do the exact same thing right?
[09:21:39] <doug65536> raisdead: function map2(input, callback) { var result = {}; $.each(input, function(k,v) { result[k] = callback(k, v); }); return result; }
[09:21:59] <raisdead> Yes, but yep. That is exactly what I did.
[09:22:09] <nhulea> yo!
[09:28:27] <millo> ciao
[09:29:19] <millo> !list
[09:31:46] <millo> ciao
[09:31:51] <millo> !list
[09:33:39] <gnarf> doug65536 raisdead - it's not built in because jQuery doesn't need it for anything
[09:34:15] <gnarf> and actually - it's not that common
[09:34:16] <gnarf> :)
[09:35:08] <doug65536> yeah, I was thinking earlier, once you have that, then people start wanting to omit some keys, and you open a can of worms
[09:35:33] <gnarf> in general the output of "map" is usually an array
[09:35:38] <gnarf> even if the input is an object
[09:35:45] <gnarf> i.e. underscore also implements it this way
[09:37:29] <akakuala> can anyone guide me on a tutorial showing how can i do a menu like this one: http://www.mirohotelbilbao.com/
[09:37:42] <doug65536> every time I think of 'map' I think about perl's map
[09:40:23] <raisdead> My use case is similar to applying a function to all children of a node in a tree
[09:40:45] <doug65536> akakuala: lol, I looked at the markup and realized it was full of errors. that page has 61 errors in w3c validator
[09:40:58] <krambiorix> hi, does anyone how i can sort  account numbers ? eg    1000, 101000, 101050, 101060, 2000, 20500, 20550    should NOT be 1000, 2000, 101000.....
[09:41:43] <doug65536> krambiorix: arr.sort(function(a,b) { return +a < +b ? -1 : +a > +b ? 1 : 0; })
[09:42:52] <Velveeta> i think that would cause it to sort numerically wouldn't it? looks like that's what he doesn't want to happen
[09:43:10] <doug65536> oh you want to force text sort?
[09:43:16] <Velveeta> i think that's what he wants, yeah
[09:43:28] <doug65536> krambiorix: arr.sort(function(a,b) { return a + '' < b + '' ? -1 : a + '' > b + '' ? 1 : 0; })
[09:43:30] <Velveeta> so it would sort like 1000, 101000, 101050, 101060, 2000, 20500, 20550
[09:43:42] <Velveeta> yeah that should do it
[09:44:35] <raisdead> doesn't arr.sort() automatically assume they are strings?
[09:45:25] <doug65536> yes, it does
[09:45:44] <raisdead> so, [1000, 101000, 101050, 101060, 2000, 20500, 20550].sort() works
[09:45:45] <doug65536> krambiorix: yes, thanks raisdead, just do arr.sort()
[09:46:18] <doug65536> krambiorix: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort
[09:46:46] <doug65536> krambiorix: let's hope there are no UTF-16 surrogate pairs in your account numbers :P
[09:49:41] <monstordh> I've got a silly question. When I enable the admin_menu module in D7, I get two identical menus, but the new one has drop-downs. How can I get rid of the redundancy?
[09:53:31] <boytoy> doug65536: Before we end this party with lots of champagne -- do you know why I'm not able to select the newly embedded videos?
[09:53:41] <boytoy> http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/dK5Us/5/
[09:54:15] <boytoy> Some kinda deferred quirk or something?
[09:54:44] <boytoy> (line 64)
[10:02:20] <gzaa> i'm trying to get a list item background to fade slowly on hover so it sort of stands out and doesnt look flat
[10:02:26] <gzaa> can i do that without a plugin?
[10:02:32] <gzaa> background-color i mean
[10:03:04] <gzaa> i tried the opacity fade but it only seemed to work when i applied a background-image
[10:05:16] <Velveeta> you can do it with a css :hover rule and a transition
[10:05:24] <Velveeta> i think, anyway
[10:06:43] <boytoy> yeah, just did a :hover rule and transition myself, works really well
[10:08:17] <boytoy> except on mobile :p
[10:08:36] <gzaa> yeah some reason hovers stay active
[10:08:36] <krambiorix> doug65536, my ajax data is more something like [{id="....", account_number:"10200", account_name:"blabla" ...................}.......]
[10:09:12] <Velveeta> yeah hovers on mobile don't work so well, given the lack of mouse cursor :D
[10:10:11] <doug65536> krambiorix: arr.sort(function(a,b) { return a.account_number < b.account_number ? -1 : a.account_number > b.account_number ? 1 : 0; })
[10:11:30] <doug65536> js> print("6" > "50000")
[10:11:47] <b-ot> doug65536: true
[10:12:35] <gzaa> do you put js links at the bottom of your html or just inline scripts?
[10:13:24] <Velveeta> i try not to have inline scripts at all, but i put all my script blocks at the bottom
[10:13:32] <Velveeta> so if i had inline script blocks, they'd be down there also
[10:13:50] <krambiorix> thanks a lot doug65536 !
[10:13:55] <gzaa> how much faster does it dl?
[10:14:05] <Velveeta> it doesn't download any faster
[10:14:11] <doug65536> krambiorix: np
[10:14:29] <Velveeta> the the perception of load time can be faster in the browser by allowing the markup to render before being blocked by the loading of scripts
[10:14:44] <gzaa> true it makes sense
[10:14:53] <gzaa> if the script is big its gonna be stuck a few ms
[10:14:57] <gzaa> the other elements
[10:15:28] <gzaa> i've noticed that with one of my client websites, i think i might try it. Slow servers dont help either
[10:15:33] <doug65536> actually, putting the scripts near the end makes it take slightly longer to get document ready - it gets a head start requesting the script downloads when they are in head
[10:15:55] <doug65536> the difference is small though
[10:16:28] <Velveeta> are you talking about some of the prefetch optimization that modern browsers do?
[10:16:37] <doug65536> yes
[10:16:44] <Velveeta> ok, i wasn't aware that applied to script blocks
[10:16:55] <doug65536> it has to download the file right?
[10:17:02] <doug65536> what's better, starting it sooner, or later?
[10:17:07] <Velveeta> right, but it also has to run it through the compiler
[10:17:16] <Velveeta> i thought script blocks were always blocking
[10:17:26] <Velveeta> unless added as dynamic dom nodes
[10:17:59] <Velveeta> does it download them in parallel but execute them in the order specified in the dom?
[10:18:05] <Velveeta> because otherwise you would run into race conditions
[10:19:11] <doug65536> if you want async download of scripts, there is an async attribute you know <script src="xxx" async>
[10:19:20] <doug65536> or defer
[10:19:39] <Velveeta> right
[10:19:48] <Velveeta> but i mean if you don't want them to async load because of dependencies
[10:20:07] <Velveeta> will it still download them in parallel, but wait to run them through the compiler until they complete in the order specified in the dom?
[10:20:21] <doug65536> the compiler is instant
[10:20:47] <Velveeta> so then they would be compiled as the downloads completed?
[10:20:54] <doug65536> it doesn't even "compile" them at load time, it builds an AST (abstract syntax tree) then JITs each thing as needed
[10:22:14] <Velveeta> i guess my question is: if it's optimized to read ahead and start pulling down those script src's so that you get a small boost by putting them in the head vs at the end of the document, how does it get around the fact that script B may be dependent on script A, if B is a smaller file and finishes downloading before A?
[10:22:21] <doug65536> the difference is small. it depends. can you find any benchmarks that clearly show one way or the other being superior? I'm pretty sure at the bottom of the page only is a holdover from old browsers that blocked completely
[10:22:31] <Velveeta> that's why i thought the nature of script tags was to be blocking
[10:23:20] <Velveeta> the total time using either method should be the same, the *perceived* time is what should be sped up by placing script tags at the bottom, as they're supposed to be downloaded, read, and executed as the browser encounters them
[10:23:21] <doug65536> I should make a php file that serves a js file and does sleep(5000) and see
[10:23:53] <Velveeta> someone pasted a link in here last week that ran benchmarks in a similar way, with sleep delays
[10:24:03] <Velveeta> but it was about placing link tags before or after script tags
[10:24:13] <doug65536> if you use AMD pattern, you can async your require.js and you get the best possible performance
[10:24:50] <Velveeta> and the verdict of that scenario was that placing link tags *after* script tags gave you a slight boost, because the browser would read ahead for assets like css and images, and download them while it was processing script tags, but the other script tags i'm pretty sure were still blocking
[10:25:50] <ph88_> doug why do you have a long number at your name ?
[10:25:54] <doug65536> if you use AMD pattern (and you should) there is only one script tag anyway, require.js
[10:26:07] <Velveeta> here's that stack overflow i was talking about: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9271276/is-the-recommendation-to-include-css-before-javascript-invalid
[10:26:14] <doug65536> ph88_: so I can use the same username everywhere and it's never taken
[10:26:21] <ph88_> lol :p
[10:27:00] <doug65536> it's also nice when players call me "Doug" over voice in first person shooters :)
[10:27:24] <Velveeta> can you teach me how to dougie?
[10:27:44] <Velveeta> not that i would actually do it, but it'd be fun to watch you teach it
[10:29:39] <marsilainen> $.post()  to send an AJAX request and then I have a function that gets called with the response, which is JSON; I get passed the 'response' into my function - what's the best way to check that the response contains expected properties?
[10:30:57] <Velveeta> use an if statement?
[10:31:08] <doug65536> Velveeta: lol
[10:31:10] <Velveeta> if (response.myProperExists) ?
[10:31:15] <Velveeta> Property*
[10:31:20] <marsilainen> is it really as simple as that?
[10:31:25] <Velveeta> it should be, yeah
[10:31:30] <marsilainen> hmm
[10:31:31] <marsilainen> ok
[10:32:11] <marsilainen> I'd seen things like:   if (response.hasOwnProperty(foo))   and I wasn't sure if I should have been doing something like that?
[10:32:16] <doug65536> marsilainen: note that there are strict comparison operators like === and !== that check that they are the same AND the same type
[10:32:48] <marsilainen> doug65536: sure, I guess that would make sense to use those in this case
[10:32:49] <Velveeta> you could use hasOwnProperty, but if you know the name of the property, and it's not something that would exist on the object prototype, there's no real need to do that
[10:33:02] <Velveeta> i usually use hasOwnProperty if i'm iterating over an object of N properties
[10:33:43] <marsilainen> I'm such a JS noob
[10:33:48] <ccmonster> when i do a window.open() the url im putting in is getting prepended with my window.location.host even though i dont want that.
[10:33:49] <doug65536> marsilainen: you can see if a property is there by saying if (object.something !== undefined). for almost all purposes, that is a sufficient check, because there's no such thing as undefined in json
[10:34:00] <ccmonster> how do i avoid that for this link?
[10:34:22] <marsilainen> doug65536: ok, cool
[10:34:41] <Velveeta> ccmonster: fully qualify the url with the protocol
[10:35:02] <Velveeta> like http://myurl.com/whatever
[10:35:17] <ccmonster> yea, and if they dont put a fully qualified url in the input?
[10:35:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does anyone know of a program that does progressive backups of a drive?
[10:35:29] <Velveeta> then fully qualify it yourself
[10:35:29] <ccmonster> can I just override the host for the a link object?
[10:35:37] <Velveeta> what exactly are you trying to do?
[10:36:03] <Velveeta> ecky--ptang-zoob: check out the documentation for jQuery.grep
[10:36:03] <ccmonster> if someone puts a url in the form, im allowing them to click a button so they can check their url, make sure it's what they intend.
[10:36:08] <Velveeta> j/k
[10:36:18] <ccmonster> sanity check button essentially.
[10:36:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I went for _underscore ;)
[10:36:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> works wonders
[10:36:39] <Velveeta> it's faster than a lot of jquery functions also
[10:37:00] <Velveeta> ccmonster: just check to see if they include the protocol at the beginning of the string, and if not, prepend it yourself
[10:37:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> doesn't it use _grep below the surface?
[10:37:37] <ccmonster> ok.
[10:37:49] <Velveeta> if (myInput.val().indexOf('http') === '-1') { url = 'http://' + myInput.val(); } else { url = myInput.val(); }
[10:38:03] <BillCriswell> '-1' ? :-p
[10:38:09] <Velveeta> ecky--ptang-zoob: doesn't what use _grep below the surface?
[10:38:14] <BillCriswell> That's not an or negative p.
[10:38:16] <Velveeta> doh, not '-1', -1 :D
[10:38:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> _underscore
[10:38:32] <Velveeta> ecky--ptang-zoob: not sure
[10:38:41] <Velveeta> as to your backup question, i don't have an answer
[10:39:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I need incremental backups
[10:39:10] <boytoy> Hi, so at http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/dK5Us/5/ -- I'm using deferred objects to run some stuff after jQuery Embedly is done autoembedding my videos. But how come I can't select these videos? (line 64)
[10:39:14] <boytoy> I can select my photos just fine. (line 61)
[10:39:15] <Velveeta> that's not exactly a jquery question :D
[10:39:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ok, how do I backup my jquery files ?
[10:40:48] <boytoy> ecky--ptang-zoob: i got a pretty cool zsh script that uses md5deep to see if your files have changed. if they have, it makes a new tgz backup with the date in the filename.
[10:41:04] <ecky--ptang-zoob> O-o
[10:41:10] <boytoy> ecky--ptang-zoob: check it out https://gist.github.com/kakekake89/6674215
[10:41:44] <marsilainen> why not use source control? (e.g. git)
[10:42:15] <marsilainen> you should commit your changes when you've implemented something new in them etc
[10:42:50] <boytoy> marsilainen: most of my folders are git repos actually.. but not a big fan of having like a mega git repo that reaches 50-100gb
[10:43:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Stupid windows 8 file history, can't they make anything right?
[10:43:06] <doug65536> boytoy: what do you mean by "select" exactly?
[10:43:34] <boytoy> doug65536: im trying to target $('.item .embedly')..
[10:43:56] <boytoy> is that the right word? i dunno
[10:44:18] <doug65536> boytoy: yes that is the right word, but select has other meanings
[10:44:30] <Velveeta> ecky--ptang-zoob: also, for future reference: "Ok, how do I backup my jquery files ?" <--- this isn't a jquery question either :D
[10:44:31] <ecky--ptang-zoob> It only backups "libraries"
[10:44:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what a piece of crap
[10:45:01] <doug65536> ecky--ptang-zoob: there are few programs on earth as useless as windows backup
[10:45:03] <Velveeta> boytoy: i'm not familiar with embedly myself, but it would seem to me that whatever it embeds in the document is still being created when your deferrers complete
[10:45:12] <Velveeta> deferreds*
[10:45:42] <doug65536> ecky--ptang-zoob: they should have called it windows data-loss express
[10:45:53] <Velveeta> does embedly emit any events you can bind listeners to when it's done with whatever it does?
[10:46:26] <Velveeta> never mind, i'll wade through its src in your fiddler page
[10:47:00] <doug65536> boytoy: none of the images have that class
[10:47:30] <boytoy> Velveeta: it does have a "done" yeah, but doug65536 and I took it out because whatever we put in there would repeat over and over due to the each
[10:47:42] <Velveeta> blegh
[10:47:55] <doug65536> you took it out you mean :)
[10:48:05] <boytoy> doug65536: the embedded videos should have that class i think
[10:48:06] <Velveeta> there appears to be a 'loaded' and 'initialized' event it emits too
[10:48:27] <doug65536> boytoy: but what you were doing didn't make a lot of sense to do for each deferred so its fine
[10:48:39] <ccmonster> Velveeta: how should i check for the correctly formed url? any suggestions? regex, something else?
[10:48:56] <Velveeta> ccmonster: i put an example in my previous statement to you, using indexOf
[10:49:18] <Velveeta> but don't use '-1', using -1, integer vs string
[10:49:44] <ccmonster> oh, didn't see the ex, sorry.
[10:52:58] <Velveeta> boytoy: try searching for $(':embedly') instead
[10:53:16] <Velveeta> it creates pseudo selectors for itself
[10:53:33] <doug65536> boytoy: $('.item .embedly') finds stuff
[10:53:46] <Velveeta> in mine it doesn't
[10:53:51] <Velveeta> although i can see them in the dom
[10:53:59] <boytoy> yeah i can see them too but cant find them
[10:54:10] <Velveeta> that's why i was guessing some other process was creating the extra nodes and still working at the time those deferreds complete
[10:54:14] <doug65536> $('.item > .embedly')
[10:54:14] <doug65536> [
[10:54:14] <doug65536> <a href=​"http:​/​/​www.youtube.com/​watch?v=MmTiqKPnhiQ" class=​"embedly play" style=​"width:​ 392px;​ height:​ auto;​">​…​</a>​
[10:54:14] <doug65536> ]
[10:54:41] <Velveeta> doug: put that inline in the actual .done block and see if it finds them at the time that block executes
[10:54:45] <gnarf> Velveeta - don't use psuedos like that without other qualifiers… it's equivalent to $("*").filter(":embedly")
[10:54:53] <doug65536> ah I see what you mean
[10:55:15] <gnarf> lots of extra work
[10:55:20] <Velveeta> gnarf: good call, i know those are some of the most expensive selectors, especially because that one loops through the element's data on top of that
[10:55:35] <tw2113> cheese!
[10:55:41] <Velveeta> das me
[10:56:56] <doug65536> boytoy: it's because the deferred it returns doesn't work as you expect
[10:57:07] <doug65536> it was right before http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/dK5Us/12/
[10:58:10] <guideX> is there some way to detect video codec's with jquery?
[10:59:12] <boytoy> doug65536: hmm.. so if i wanna target the embeds i gotta do it from embedly's done? i.e. http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/dK5Us/11/ (line 41)
[10:59:23] <doug65536> boytoy: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/dK5Us/14/
[11:00:26] <boytoy> ooh whats this..
[11:01:23] <boytoy> nice, that old var is back!
[11:02:04] <doug65536> boytoy: ok. what's wrong with that?
[11:02:19] <boytoy> nothing at all my friend, god bless you
[11:02:33] <boytoy> god bless Velveeta as well who is probably hung over from all the mugs of whisky he drank this weekend
[11:02:44] <Velveeta> :D
[11:02:50] <Velveeta> <-- atheist, but i get the sentiment
[11:02:58] <boytoy> hehe
[11:03:06] <blackmesa> hi all. I want to clear input fields after form submit. I discovered this little function and it works fine except on radio buttons. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e997372e01dcd5d63200 anyone can help ?
[11:03:10] <doug65536> boytoy: I suppose that deferred it returns resolves earlier than what you need. I just made it resolve when the display callback fires
[11:04:05] <Velveeta> blackmesa: all that plugin does is fire the native form reset… it's just adding a function layer to do what you can do in the same amount of js yourself
[11:04:23] <boytoy> doug65536: earlier you made it resolve on done: function(results) {}, are there any benefits to putting it in display instead?
[11:04:47] <Velveeta> boytoy: i would that the major benefit is that it actually works? :D
[11:04:56] <boytoy> lol
[11:04:57] <doug65536> boytoy: I wouldn't know without reading through the embedly documentation. I haven't tried it
[11:05:22] <boytoy> doug65536: i guess it's just a matter of semantics as they say, lemme try
[11:05:32] <jonclark> i can attest that Velveeta is pure class
[11:05:32] <guideX> is there some way of detecting if a .mov (specific codec) video is supported without using html5?
[11:06:26] * Velveeta shines his knuckles on his shirt.
[11:06:30] <doug65536> guideX: prompt("Is MOV video supported in this browser? k thx bye")
[11:06:36] <Velveeta> lol
[11:06:47] <boytoy> doug65536: yeah seems alright http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/dK5Us/15/
[11:06:53] <boytoy> haha
[11:06:55] <guideX> having a hell of a time figuring out how to detect if the codec is supported
[11:07:19] <guideX> it seems I can only detect if it's supported if the browser supports html5
[11:08:39] <boytoy> doug65536: now these combined with http://jsfiddle.net/desandro/Qd67z/5/ is gonna make quite the show :P
[11:08:41] <doug65536> guideX: how do you show the video at all without html5?
[11:08:51] <boytoy> * this
[11:09:05] <guideX> there's a fall back embed tag, and sometimes it will open in the browser using media player
[11:09:06] <boytoy> got some other goodies in the bag as well, will show y'all when im done
[11:09:21] <guideX> sometimes media player won't open the file though, for those users, I wish to display a message
[11:09:34] <doug65536> guideX: my only hope/guess would be trying to catch an error event
[11:09:49] <guideX> oh that's an idea..
[11:10:03] <guideX> thanks ill look into it
[11:10:05] <Velveeta> yeah i was about to suggest wrapping it in a try/catch
[11:11:43] <doug65536> guideX: even if html5 *is* supported, the function to check only asks the browser to guess whether it will work. it actually returns "maybe" or "probably" (I'm not kidding). so you may need to handle errors even in html5
[11:12:32] <guideX> oic.. I haven't had any problems with html5 enabled browsers, but yeah i'll check into that
[11:13:19] <guideX> really i've only had problems with ie8 (running under winxp) all other browsers (I've tried) seem capable of playing the video
[11:15:54] <doug65536> guideX: I think the real solution is: don't use mov. In winxp they would need to install quicktime player, right?
[11:16:22] <guideX> well yes, the problem with that is, the video's are coming from an iphone where the app can only encode to this mov format
[11:16:35] <guideX> but yeah that is a better way, to convert the videos to other formats
[11:16:59] <doug65536> ffmpeg is amazing for converting video file formats imho
[11:17:16] <guideX> I will check it out
[11:17:39] <guideX> it's an option to have the web services convert the video after the iphone sends them
[11:18:17] <doug65536> ffmpeg is open source, and $0, and there are builds for windows and linux
[11:18:33] <doug65536> and it is highly multithreaded, and will process practically any format
[11:29:02] <gzaa> can anyone give me an example of a transition so i can fade li:hover
[11:29:58] <Zzaichik> with javascript? CSS won't do?
[11:32:20] <guideX> gzaa: http://www.w3schools.com/css3/css3_transitions.asp
[11:32:51] <gzaa> i mean not using css3
[11:32:56] <gzaa> because i want to support IE
[11:32:57] <gzaa> 7
[11:33:02] <gzaa> and 8
[11:33:03] <jedimind> why
[11:33:20] <jedimind> why slow down the interface for all browsers so that you can support something trivial as a fade for ie7/8 ?
[11:33:27] <gzaa> because my clients users are most likely noobs
[11:33:30] <jedimind> why not use css3, and then in ie7/8 just toggle visibility
[11:33:32] <jedimind> "most likely"
[11:33:33] <guideX> oic
[11:33:47] <jedimind> noobs doesnt meant they live in north korea
[11:33:56] <jedimind> even noobs have modern browsers
[11:33:57] <doug65536> gzaa: what do you mean by "fade"
[11:34:13] <guideX> gzaa: if you scroll halfway down on this page, you will find the answer http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6800950/smooth-transition-between-two-class-and-classhover

[11:36:17] <louism2wash> Hey guys, is there any danger is trying to set events on DOM objects that don't exist?  From what I can tell when I try to set a click event on an element that doesn't exits it is simply returning a blank array because no DOM object were matched by the jquery selector.  Am I right to assume that there is no hard in this?
[11:36:40] <louism2wash> *harm
[11:36:53] <NoiseEee> louism2wash: you simply cannot set a handler directly on an object that doesnt exist
[11:36:59] <doug65536> louism2wash: correct, any selector that doesn't match anything results in an empty selector, so any methods called on it won't do anything
[11:37:01] <NoiseEee> louism2wash: but you can use event delegation via on()
[11:37:39] <louism2wash> NoiseEee: what exactly is event delegation?  I have never heard that term before.
[11:37:57] <tdawg> hello everyone i have a question
[11:38:12] <tdawg> im very new to jquery, and I have a hover function that uses slideDown for a div, and when you click the div it will sildeUp, however when it slides up, it checks to see its closed, and just re-opens, any way to prevent this
[11:40:08] <NoiseEee> louism2wash: observing on a parent for elements that may/may not exist when the handler is assigned.  $(someParent).on('click','selectorOfThingsHereNowOrLater',function() {});
[11:40:31] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: That answer should be on speed dial.
[11:41:06] <doug65536> BillCriswell: yes
[11:43:57] <louism2wash> NoiseEee: ahhh, very useful
[12:06:09] <frankperez87> Hey everyone, i have a question for anyone thats around regarding ajax with jquery and chain selects. The question is: I have 3 select boxes that populate with ajax based on the first selection. What i'm trying to do is save the first selection to a cookie, which is not a problem but then I need it to trigger the ajax of the .change function. .trigger('change') does not work, and I'm wondering what I could use to make this happen.
[12:08:27] <dstarh> we have a bunch of old code that's currently written against 1.3.2 and need to upgrade it to 1.9.1.  So far that seems to be working pretty well.  We do however have jqUI 1.5.2 which relies on the jquery.MSIE browser checks.  Does anyone know what the oldest jquery ui relase I can use with 1.9.1?
[12:08:57] <dstarh> the browser checks were removed some time ago
[12:12:55] <dstarh> anyone here?
[12:12:57] <escher> scott_gonzalez:  Pinging you on this one because I feel like you might have an answer for dstarh (or at least know where to find it).
[12:13:21] <dstarh> escher: thanks
[12:13:51] <scott_gonzalez> dstarh: hmmm....let me see
[12:14:32] <dstarh> my goal is to break as little UI code as possible yet be compatible with JQ 1.9.1
[12:15:27] <scott_gonzalez> dstarh: Well, the only versions we've tested 1.9.1 with is UI 1.10.x.
[12:15:45] <scott_gonzalez> UI 1.9.x is tested up to core 1.8.3
[12:16:03] <scott_gonzalez> UI 1.8.x was tested up to core 1.8.2
[12:16:20] <scott_gonzalez> But UI 1.5 -> UI 1.7 was a pretty big change IIRC.
[12:16:33] <scott_gonzalez> It introduced the CSS framework, which brought a lot of changes.
[12:16:50] <scott_gonzalez> You should ignore the fact that UI 1.6.x even exists ;-)
[12:17:28] <scott_gonzalez> You can try UI 1.8.24 + jQuery Migrate.
[12:17:42] <scott_gonzalez> But you may need to do a fair amount of updating to go from 1.5 to 1.8.
[12:17:57] <scott_gonzalez> And we didn't have good upgrade guides until later.
[12:18:21] <scott_gonzalez> But this should at least point you in the right direction: http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.7/
[12:18:29] <scott_gonzalez> and http://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.8/
[12:19:01] <scott_gonzalez> UI 1.9.0 introduced a ton of breaking changes, but they're all hidden behind a back compat flag.
[12:19:22] <dstarh> ok thanks for the info scott_gonzalez
[12:19:35] <scott_gonzalez> So if you can upgrade to 1.8.0, you should be able to upgrade to 1.8.24, and with the back compat flag you should be able to get to 1.9.2.
[12:19:45] <scott_gonzalez> 1.9.x is in back-compat mode by default.
[12:20:01] <scott_gonzalez> So if you want, you can just start with 1.9.2 and see what breaks.
[12:20:24] <scott_gonzalez> A lot of it will probably depend on which plugins you're using and how much customization you're doing.
[12:20:24] <dstarh> sweet thanks agains
[12:20:28] <scott_gonzalez> No problem.
[12:20:30] <dstarh> yep
[12:21:46] <scott_gonzalez> 1.8.4 is when the upgrade guides started including examples for everything. (Yes, it's terrible that we need upgrade guides for patch releases.)
[12:21:58] <scott_gonzalez> But we got our shit together with 1.9.
[12:22:38] <frankperez87> anythoughts on my question? any feedback would be helpful
[12:27:10] <scott_gonzalez> frankperez87: http://jsbin.com/ogUTiJe/1/
[12:28:45] <frankperez87> scott_gonzalez: thanks for the reply, but the question is actually to trigger those changes on a page load. So assume that i set my selections to a cookie and then when the page loads up the next time i need that series of events to happen. Select 1 should default to the selected value, then load up select 2 with the ajaxed values
[12:29:53] <scott_gonzalez> .trigger( "change" ) should definitely work.
[12:30:01] <scott_gonzalez> But that's really not an ideal solution.
[12:30:13] <scott_gonzalez> If you know the values you want to populate, you should just render those from the server.
[12:30:21] <scott_gonzalez> It'll be a much better experience for the user.
[12:30:41] <scott_gonzalez> Also, storing the values in cookies will add extra data to every request.
[12:31:26] <smsfail> I am trying to change the class of the 'a' inside this string. but .children doesn't find it. anyone available to take a quick look? http://jsfiddle.net/YndGA/
[12:31:29] <frankperez87> scott_gonzalez: trigger change does not seem to work, and i'd like to reuse the code that is already there instead of having to reproduce the ajax requests in my onload section.
[12:32:16] <scott_gonzalez> smsfail: You want .find(), not .children().
[12:32:29] <scott_gonzalez> Unless you plan on doing .children().children().children()
[12:32:36] <smsfail> scott_gonzalez: can I still combine the .attr(atr, new) with that?
[12:32:51] <scott_gonzalez> Yes, almost every method in jQuery is chainable.
[12:32:59] <scott_gonzalez> http://api.jquery.com/find/
[12:33:54] <scott_gonzalez> frankperez87: Works just fine for me: http://jsbin.com/ogUTiJe/2/ (wait 2 seconds)
[12:35:40] <smsfail> scott_gonzalez: exactly what I needed. Thank you very much man!
[12:37:16] <frankperez87> scott_gonzalez: odd, ill have to back track now to see why its not working on my end. maybe i just need to take a step away and come back. Thanks though for the help.
[12:51:17] <BostonMA1776> Right now I am selecting elements using $(child2.getElementsByTagName('div') this caused problems, is there a way I can change that to get elements by classname? What would the syntax be?
[12:52:16] <NoiseEee> BostonMA1776: why not use jquery methods?
[12:52:19] <dstarh> BostonMA1776: is child2 already a jquery object?
[12:52:38] <dstarh> if so child2.find('.my-class-name') will do that
[12:52:56] <dstarh> otherwise $(child2).find('.my-class-name')
[12:53:29] <dstarh> or if you only want divs with a specific classname you can use 'div.my-class-name'
[12:55:13] <BostonMA1776> dstarh: Yes, it is a jquery object.
[12:55:27] <dstarh> then .find should work
[12:55:49] <BostonMA1776> dstarh: Thanks, I hope so haha.
[13:03:30] <marcgwilson> hi folks, jquery/js n00b here and I've got a basic question
[13:03:59] <marcgwilson> I'm trying to find all elements with a specific id
[13:04:12] <NoiseEee> marcgwilson: but only element in a document can have that ID.
[13:04:17] <NoiseEee> marcgwilson: IDs must be unique
[13:04:26] <NoiseEee> s/only element/only one element./
[13:04:46] <marcgwilson> ok, they have unique ids
[13:05:11] <marcgwilson> sorry, probably not using the correct html nomenclature
[13:05:24] <marcgwilson> here's the relevant snippet: http://pastie.org/8349754
[13:05:58] <marcgwilson> p = $("#image-list"); works as I expect it to when I then print it to the console using console.log("p: " + p.html());
[13:07:07] <marcgwilson> what I'm trying to find is the element with id="id_images-0-sort_order"
[13:07:29] <NoiseEee> well since there's only one of those, why not $('#id_images-0-sort_order')
[13:09:28] <marcgwilson> I wanted to start with this basic case before moving on to a regex where I find everything with ids that end in "sort_order"
[13:11:07] <NoiseEee> well you don't need a regex for that
[13:11:17] <NoiseEee> you can use selectors
[13:11:24] <raj> is using .val('whatever') to set a select a bad idea?
[13:11:42] <NoiseEee> http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200601/css_3_selectors_explained/ @ marcgwilson , see first table
[13:12:15] <NoiseEee> marcgwilson: p.find('[id$="sort_order"]'); for example
[13:12:24] <NoiseEee> raj: no
[13:15:40] <smsfail> one more question for anyone. I have a plugin that adds a button to the dom after someone clicks something. I have the buttons jquery event inside the markup already inside $(document).ready. The button event never works. Doing something wrong?
[13:17:31] <NoiseEee> marcgwilson: construct a jsfiddle showing it doesnt work
[13:21:51] <marcgwilson> NoiseEee: it does indeed work. Thanks! I wasn't able to verify it to myself because the code I was using to do so was broken. On to the next challenge! :D
[13:22:45] <NoiseEee> marcgwilson: sweet
[13:40:20] <emilsedgh_> im using jquery mobile. my issue is that i have some buttons on a footer and in my content there's a listview. when i tap on the buttons on the footer, the listview gets tapped.
[13:40:28] <houser> From within a jquery plugin, is it possible to remove the plugin from its container and add it again?
[13:48:03] <jedimind> houser most plugins have an ability to be destroyed / re-initiated if they're properly written
[13:48:07] <jedimind> but its dependent on the plugin, not jquery
[13:51:48] <BostonMA1776> dstarh: Hey, are you still there? I finally, fixed all the errors and tried your suggestion with find. I am still having a problem. I will write down the new problem soon.
[13:52:41] <BostonMA1776> This was my previous selector $(child2.getElementsByTagName('div')[i-1]).attr('id',('p' + i));
[13:52:49] <BostonMA1776> That was in a for loop.
[13:53:28] <thand> With Jquery, I have a function that modifies href on click Is there any way to reverse/toggle it (or reset the page without reloading), so it'll be original again
[13:53:32] <BostonMA1776> I gave all the divs I want to count the id tab_paragraph and changed the selector to $(child2.find('.tab_paragraph')[i-1]).attr('id',('p' + i));
[13:53:42] <thand> I tried using unbind()
[13:53:48] <thand> but it seems to do something permanent
[13:53:56] <thand> code: <span class="buttons" onclick="$('.buttons').hide(); $(function(){ $('a').click(function(){$(this).attr('href', '/m.swf?file=' + $(this).attr('href') + '&cookie=false&autoplay=true'); });});">Flash player</span>
[13:54:22] <BostonMA1776> Is find meant to be used that way?
[13:56:00] <NoiseEee> thand: step away from the inlineJS
[13:56:14] <thand> yeah I know
[13:56:17] <NoiseEee> thand: that code is unmaintainable and confusing.
[13:56:21] <NoiseEee> don't 'yeah i know', do it!
[13:56:27] <thand> okay now what
[13:56:58] <NoiseEee> BostonMA1776: $(child2).find(      not $(child2.find(
[13:57:15] <BostonMA1776> NoiseEee: Thank you.
[13:57:39] <thand> NoiseEee:
[13:57:41] <thand> $('a').click(function(){
[13:57:43] <thand> $(this).attr('href', '/m.swf?file=' + $(this).attr('href') + '&cookie=false&autoplay=true');
[13:57:45] <thand> });
[13:58:29] <thand> I can try dicking with .unbind() again
[13:58:30] <NoiseEee> thand: try using .prop instead of .attr, but really, get rid of the inline JS.   observe events. use functions.
[13:58:46] <thand> alright
[13:58:53] <BostonMA1776> NoiseEee: *tears of joy* Thank you for the help.
[13:59:00] <NoiseEee> BostonMA1776: np!
[14:01:53] <raj> thanks NoiseEee
[14:02:12] <NoiseEee> ooook Ra
[14:02:13] <NoiseEee> j
[14:08:11] <thand> so, how do I revert/disable a .click function
[14:08:18] <thand> or toggle it

[14:28:03] <sunbeam> i want to click on a link and when that link is clicked have a certain light box popup (that contains a form)
[14:28:06] <sunbeam> how can i best do this?
[14:28:26] <jphase> sunbeam: check into jquery colorbox
[14:28:34] <jphase> or similar
[14:28:54] <dwarder> i would use a popup plugin
[14:30:02] <sunbeam> dwarder: like which
[14:30:36] <dwarder> like whatever you find
[14:30:49] <sunbeam> seriously, any recommended ones
[14:31:08] <dwarder> i would google

[14:32:32] <jphase> colorbox yo
[14:37:45] <sunbeam> jphase: yes
[14:37:49] <sunbeam> jphase: thanks
[14:37:52] <sunbeam> have you worked with this?
[14:38:04] <jphase> yeah, it's my go to solution for non-custom lightboxes
[14:38:24] <jphase> has a good API, does iframey stuff, youtube videos, embedded links, slideshows with rel tags on images, etc.
[14:38:48] <jphase> has like 4 or 5 themes too I believe
[14:55:23] <nycnewb87> hi everyone... can someone tell me why this http://pastie.org/8350051 won't work. I just want an event listener to listen for the class .comment-box-btn to have the attribute 'disabled' then change the color and background-color
[14:56:09] <jphase> nycnewb87:  well your color ##777 is a little odd looking but doubt that's your problem
[14:56:38] <nycnewb87> jphase: no it came from my designer it's good
[14:56:39] <snover> attr is not an event listener man. there is no event listener for property changes. you are doing it wrong.
[14:56:39] <jphase> also might want to use hasAttr
[14:56:43] <jphase> oh okay
[14:56:54] <jphase> I mean, ##777 isn't really a color fyi
[14:56:57] <jphase> 777 is the color
[14:57:09] <jphase> #777 = #777777, but idk how the double ## works honestly
[14:57:17] <nycnewb87> jphase: hmm that sounds splendid let me try it
[14:57:24] <snover> it doesn’t work. it’s just wrong.
[14:57:32] <jphase> also your even isn't an event
[14:57:38] <snover> i already said that.
[14:57:57] <nycnewb87> Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'hasAttr'
[14:58:00] <jphase> sorry snover, didn't mean to step on your toes lol
[14:58:29] <nycnewb87> ok well if it isn't an event what is it?
[14:58:31] <snover> that’s because hasAttr is not a thing
[14:58:34] <jphase> oh yeah, not has attr, i mean er..
[14:58:35] <snover> it is a property setter
[14:58:37] <snover> read the documentation
[14:59:27] <jphase> nycnewb87: .click(function(){   or   .on('click', function(){   perhaps?
[14:59:42] <nycnewb87> no not on click
[15:00:18] <nycnewb87> if I can't put something in document.ready I will have to repeat the same code all over the place
[15:00:26] <jphase> nycnewb87: there's no way to bind an event on "when disabled is changed" kinda thing
[15:01:06] <jphase> you can do .change or .click or some sort of an event with the element. When do you want this code to happen?
[15:03:06] <jphase> and nycnewb87, my .hasAttr was wrong before, I add that method in most of my projects and forgot it's not baked in :x
[15:10:42] <nycnewb87> my internet crapped out, still having the issue with event listeners for the existance of an attribute
[15:12:48] <Velveeta> i'm about to hulk smash our jenkins server
[15:15:05] <grafi> haha Velveeta
[15:15:06] <grafi> :P
[15:15:19] <grafi> whats it not doing?
[15:15:19] <grafi> :P
[15:15:20] <jphase> nycnewb87: when do you want your event to happen?
[15:15:31] <Velveeta> we use this 'testem' node module to run our CI tests for deploying a build
[15:15:55] <Velveeta> and i've just spent the last 2 weeks refactoring all of our unit tests, and they're now beautiful… except for the passing part
[15:16:11] <grafi> beautiful and not passing
[15:16:13] <grafi> :)
[15:16:21] <Velveeta> and they actually do pass when i run them in clients on my own machine, but in CI mode, they're throwing an error about max call stack size exceeded
[15:16:44] <grafi> nice
[15:16:45] <grafi> ...
[15:16:53] <Velveeta> because it has this custom JSON.stringify function it's using internally, which tries to recursively parse test results between modules
[15:17:13] <grafi> im sure that sounded like a good idea at the time
[15:17:16] <Velveeta> and it's choking somewhere because it keeps bouncing back and forth between a couple of item references
[15:17:39] <Velveeta> yeah i'm sure it did too, but i updated testem to try to see if that was fixed, and their latest build was in the past month or so, and it's still choking
[15:18:09] <grafi> hmmmmmm
[15:18:13] <grafi> thats dumb :P
[15:18:17] <Velveeta> we have a testswarm server nearly ready to go, so i think i'm just gonna throw up my hands and kick testem to the curb, once i get a runthrough of how to interface w/ the testswarm box
[15:18:47] <grafi> "If your tests fail, change the testing software"
[15:18:48] <grafi> :D
[15:18:51] <Velveeta> heheheh
[15:18:59] <grafi> i need that on a tshirt
[15:19:02] <Velveeta> it's because of the way it's handling the message passing from file to file
[15:19:11] <Krinkle> Velveeta: Hi, anything in particular you're looking to get help on?
[15:19:27] <grafi> he needs to turn into hulk
[15:19:33] <grafi> can you help us with that Krinkle ?
[15:19:38] <Velveeta> we have all of our widgets' tests in separate files, and they're included via a dynamic iframe, and it looks like the test results are being stringified to pass back to the main page
[15:19:41] <nycnewb87> jphase: whenever the attribute 'disabled' exists
[15:19:41] <Krinkle> (within the realm of TestSwarm)
[15:19:44] <Velveeta> it's that stringification that it's choking on
[15:20:13] <jphase> nycnewb87: try using it in your selector then.... $('input:disabled')
[15:20:17] <grafi> how many tests are there?
[15:20:18] <grafi> oô
[15:20:20] <jphase> you still need an event though ;)
[15:20:22] <Velveeta> krinkle: so, one of our guys that was in charge of that project said it's just about ready to go, and they have VM images ready for browsers we lack coverage in i guess, he just said he needs to walk me through how to interface our jenkins process with it
[15:20:36] <Velveeta> grafi: well, the particular module it's choking on is 57 tests
[15:20:41] <grafi> hm
[15:20:42] <nycnewb87> jphase: ok trying now
[15:20:55] <Velveeta> it's nothing extreme, but also i hate to think i'm gonna have to break these things up into smaller batches to get around something dumb like that
[15:20:58] <grafi> i would have expected more
[15:21:02] <Velveeta> yeah
[15:21:07] <jphase> nycnewb87: if you want some code to fire on doc ready if inputs are disabled, just don't use an event and wrap your code in an if like above
[15:21:21] <Velveeta> i mean it's not like i'm trying to force thousands of tests through that stringifier or anything
[15:21:21] <grafi> yeah breaking it up is a shitty solution
[15:21:27] <Velveeta> yup
[15:21:38] <grafi> that kind of sucks
[15:21:39] <grafi> ^^
[15:21:49] <nycnewb87> jphase: not just on doc ready...that would only be on page load
[15:22:03] <Velveeta> yeah, i'll just get w/ him tomorrow and hopefully it's a 5 minute conversation for how to switch our build server to use it instead of testem
[15:22:18] <grafi> probably
[15:22:20] <grafi> :P
[15:22:22] <Velveeta> and krinkle, i'll keep you in mind if i/we run into any issues w/ testswarm itself :)
[15:22:25] <jphase> nycnewb87: there is no event "when inputs are disabled on the page". You'd have to bind to whatever event disables the inputs
[15:22:36] <jphase> or do some ghetto setTimeout action ;)
[15:22:54] <nycnewb87> jphase: ew that sucks
[15:23:08] <jphase> nycnewb87:  yeah, so don't use setTimeout
[15:23:17] <Krinkle> Velveeta: So you're running your own browser virtual machines?
[15:23:23] <jphase> nycnewb87: what is disabling your inputs?  server side code?
[15:23:44] <Velveeta> krinkle: yeah, one of the original ideas was backing it out to browserstack, but there were concerns about allowing them to tunnel into our network
[15:23:49] <grafi> maaaaan i hate DHL ._.
[15:23:52] <Velveeta> so apparently they went the route of hosting their own VM's
[15:24:13] <nycnewb87> jphase: no client side. moderately heavy ui
[15:24:50] <Krinkle> Velveeta: I'm assuming you run tests on a test copy, right? e.g. in each jenkins job you set up the application with its own clean database and install of the software from version control, so you tunnel that local hostname only.
[15:24:59] <jphase> nycnewb87: then whatever event is disabling your inputs, add on your code to that event
[15:25:27] <Krinkle> And if you have the capacity to run your own browser farm, you sure have the capacity to make sure that jenkins is on its own host and not on the same server as your master production database
[15:25:58] <Velveeta> i don't think it's an issue of hosting resources, i think it's just an extremely paranoid IT group
[15:26:34] <Velveeta> we host a lot of healthcare PHI and have to meet hippa compliance standards and they're probably just paranoid about exposing anything they don't absolutely have to
[15:26:51] <Velveeta> to even request an external IP for something like an engineering blog, it's like a 6 month ordeal of red tape
[15:26:59] <Krinkle> although I have very little detail, the few details you shared make it sound like a typical IT group that isn't paranoid as much as it is outdated and stuck with old habits and having difficulty appluing that to new technology.
[15:27:15] <Velveeta> that's entirely possible, yes :D
[15:27:57] <Krinkle> The kind where they use a LANG="JavaScript" attribute on script tags, and wrap inline scripts and style tags in <!-- comments.
[15:28:20] <Velveeta> well, our engineers are completely separate from the ops group that maintains server control
[15:28:25] <Krinkle> good
[15:28:26] <Krinkle> :)
[15:28:36] <Krinkle> Anyway, good luck. Let me know if there's anything swarmy you need help with.
[15:28:45] <Velveeta> awesome, thanks :)
[15:28:55] <Velveeta> and on that note, i gotta gtfo for now and head home
[15:30:36] <grafi> quitter
[15:30:36] <grafi> :P
[15:35:16] <oxsav> hey there
[15:35:27] <emilsedgh_> guys, where can i find some sort of roadmap for jquery mobile? does such thing even exist?
[15:35:34] <oxsav> I'm trying to do something easy but it's not working: http://jsfiddle.net/4X7ef/
[15:36:23] <oxsav> when I click the letters below the <hr /> they shoould appear above <hr /> and not disapear from below
[15:36:41] <oxsav> do you know why do they appear above the <hr /> and desapear below? :s
[15:43:07] <blackmesa> hi all. I want to clear input fields after form submit. I discovered this little function and it works fine except on radio buttons. https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e997372e01dcd5d63200 anyone can help ?
[15:44:20] <jphase> blackmesa: clear after form submit? try just setting autocomplete="off" in your form
[15:44:26] <jphase> if it's a real form submit that is
[15:47:02] <blackmesa> thx
[15:51:54] <oxsav> Hey, I have this example, http://jsfiddle.net/4X7ef/ , and I'm trying to click in one element below the <hr /> and substitute the html above the <hr /> from that element I click. But when I click in one element it desappears, do you know why?
[15:57:36] <dwarder> is there a problem with handlebars and bubbling?
[16:07:53] <dwarder> with event.stopPropagation(); not working in template
[16:08:17] <dwarder> should delegate work normal with the rendered template?
[16:08:20] <dwarder> must?
[16:09:46] <doug65536> oxsav: that is not how you do that correctly
[16:11:23] <oxsav> doug65536: how can i do it correctly?
[16:11:52] <doug65536> oxsav: updating fiddle... one moment
[16:11:59] <oxsav> tks
[16:12:32] <sunbeam> jphase: here?
[16:12:43] <jphase> oxsav: http://jsfiddle.net/4X7ef/
[16:12:46] <jphase> sunbeam: sup?
[16:13:12] <sunbeam> jphase: whats the best way to show a yet hidden .class div with colorbox?
[16:13:22] <doug65536> oxsav: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/4X7ef/4/
[16:13:43] <sunbeam> $(".class").colorbox();
[16:13:47] <jphase> sunbeam: I think there's an option called inline: true
[16:13:49] <sunbeam> this doesnt work jphase
[16:14:08] <oxsav> doug65536: thankyou very much :)
[16:14:25] <jphase> sunbeam: my bad, didn't send the updated fiddle
[16:14:27] <sunbeam> jphase: tried that aswell
[16:14:48] <jphase> sunbeam: oh actually, try the html: option
[16:14:57] <doug65536> oxsav: np
[16:15:26] <sunbeam> jphase: do i need to add the full html there?
[16:15:59] <jphase> there's several ways to do it, but i think it's like...  $('a.something').click(function(){ $.colorbox({ html: $('.someclass').html() }); });
[16:16:01] <jphase> something like that
[16:16:17] <jphase> I have to look this up almost every time I do it sunbeam, it should be in the usage on their site somewhere though
[16:16:47] <sunbeam> jphase: thats exactly what i do now
[16:16:48] <jphase> sunbeam: http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/example1/   (click the Inline HTML link at the bottom)
[16:16:50] <sunbeam> i see no errors
[16:17:04] <sunbeam> jphase: right
[16:17:13] <jphase> is that what you mean?
[16:17:52] <jphase> oh right, on their example they use the href of their anchor tag and then just have a "inline" class added, yours isn't working though eh?
[16:17:53] <grafi> doug65536 why not $('#local').html($(this).clone()); this?
[16:18:18] <grafi> doesnt .html() do the empty().append() anyways when passing an element in?
[16:18:28] <jphase> yep
[16:18:32] <doug65536> grafi: .html takes text
[16:18:42] <jphase> that's what my fiddle was doing for him but I linked wrong, I'd just use $(this).html()
[16:18:49] <grafi> then why does it work^^
[16:19:12] <doug65536> grafi: doing it with objects will be drastically faster, even if .html would work
[16:19:26] <jphase> true dat
[16:20:14] <grafi> $(this).html() wont give you the div.video stuff though, only the content, no?
[16:20:39] <grafi> not sure if thats something he cares about
[16:20:43] <doug65536> grafi: right
[16:20:55] <jphase> nah, it'll give the div too
[16:21:09] <doug65536> jphase: no it won't. .html gives you innerHTML
[16:21:17] <jphase> let me re-fiddle
[16:21:26] <jphase> worked for me, might not be the best approach but I had it working with the div
[16:21:31] <grafi> doug65536 http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.10.2&fn=jQuery.fn.html
[16:21:37] <grafi> look at the bottom
[16:21:41] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/4X7ef/5/
[16:21:44] <grafi> if (elem) {
[16:21:44] <grafi>             this.empty().append(value);
[16:21:44] <grafi>         }
[16:21:46] <jphase> has the div in there when you inspect
[16:22:00] <jphase> idk if it's the "right" way but it worked for me anyhow =\
[16:22:17] <grafi> good enough
[16:22:20] <grafi> :P
[16:22:36] <doug65536> jphase: avoid strings like the plague in js. their performance is awful
[16:22:39] <grafi> jphase <div id="local">c</div>
[16:22:46] <grafi> the div.video is missing ;)
[16:23:19] <jphase> doug65536: I don't disagree. It's just a simple solution. If you're just doing something like this and not a lot on the page you'd hardly notice the time
[16:23:33] <jphase> but yeah, objects ftw totally
[16:23:50] <jphase> I mean, honestly I'd not even grab the div
[16:23:58] <jphase> I'd just get the contents or something typically in this application
[16:24:04] <jphase> divs are identical
[16:24:16] <oxsav> I can't test it right now with objects.. But tomorrow I can give you the news, about if that worked or not!
[16:24:19] <grafi> maybe not with different classes attached
[16:24:25] <doug65536> doing that with strings is like making a multiply function and looping adds. sure, they won't notice that either, but would you do that?
[16:24:39] <jphase> oxsav: doug65536's example will definitely work and is actually the correct way to do it
[16:24:41] <grafi> sure i would
[16:24:43] <grafi> ;P
[16:24:45] <jphase> dotting i's and crossing t's approach
[16:25:08] <oxsav> k, tks =D
[16:25:52] <jphase> doug65536: I'm a realist. I do things based on their application. copying "a" is better than cloning a DOM object in most simple uses like this for me. I take shortcuts as needed when it doesn't hurt the project. Granted, this also doesn't save time so I'd probably clone anyhow hehe
[16:26:11] <jphase> I'm not disagreeing with you though
[16:27:28] <doug65536> jphase: I took a more generalized approach - I didn't take a shortcut to assuming that the div they click is identical to the one at the top, then just copying the one letter - I took the whole 'thing' they clicked and duplicated it at the top.
[16:29:13] <doug65536> jphase: I am so accustomed to cloning nodes for things like dynamically growing forms that I didn't take a shortcut :)
[16:30:00] <gzaa> i'm using a fixed layout with little content, when i view the site on a monitor thats > 1600 theres too much white space. I tried using media queries to increase the font sizes but that didnt work. Anyone know how i can make this work without actually making it responsive?
[16:30:56] <gzaa> if i zoom in some it looks 15% it appears ok on the 20"+ monitors
[16:31:03] <jphase> doug65536: amen. I find my approaches to coding are far different than my answers on stackoverflow hehe
[16:31:19] <oxsav> Well ppl, thank you for everything I have to sleep now ;)
[16:31:23] <oxsav> bye
[16:32:00] <jphase> gzaa: designing based on zoom level isn't the best idea imo. But if I were you I'd use media queries. What didn't work with them?
[16:32:34] <jphase> well nvm, that's a dumb question, they just didn't work
[16:32:51] <jphase> probably a classname or element you need to match exactly to override a previous style
[16:33:36] <dse> I want to append some text to the bottom of datepicker ui. it's working fine when I paste it into the console, but it gets lost on destroy(). is there an event I can bind this too? I couldn't find any events at http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[16:33:44] <jphase> try inspecting the element to see where exactly the font-size declaration is coming from and copy the exact css declaration for it and paste into your media query. Often times .something != a.something or similar
[16:37:18] <dse> anyone know the best way to append to datepicker?
[16:39:10] <jphase> dse: hmm, I don't know if there's a good event for that really, you may actually want to extend that plugin
[16:39:25] <jphase> if I were you I'd download the datetimepicker add on and see how they do it
[16:39:51] <jphase> otherwise you'd have to use some ghetto setTimeout approach
[16:40:11] <jphase> I mean, they have the beforeShow
[16:40:17] <jphase> you tried working with that?
[16:40:41] <dse> no i haven't
[16:40:54] <dse> I was just trying (document).ready
[16:40:55] <jphase> I mean, doesn't sound promising cause it's "before" rather than after
[16:41:02] <dse> aha good point
[16:41:17] <jphase> here's a ghetto setTimeout approach using that:  http://jsbin.com/ikawe/1/edit
[16:41:24] <jphase> but that's an icky example
[16:41:43] <gzaa> jphase: i was just increasing font-sizes using min-device-width: 1200px. Nothing changed when i tested it on my monitor. Is it limited because the container is only 960?
[16:41:44] <jphase> the better way would be to .extend and write your own option onto jquery ui
[16:42:10] <jphase> gzaa: you mentioned zoom earlier, were you resizing your browser or using cmd/ctrl -  and zooming out?
[16:42:20] <dse> ahah I see. creative. thanks jphase
[16:43:12] <gzaa> jphase I was zooming in to see how it would look on the bigger monitor, thats all.
[16:44:08] <jphase> gzaa: resize your browser to test the media queries, don't use zoom
[16:45:15] <gzaa> I'll try and explain it better
[16:45:54] <jphase> gzaa: you have the site public for me to see by chance?
[16:46:44] <gzaa> header: 200px, content:500px, footer: 200px. site fits perfectly on a 18" monitor. On my monitor that has a res of 1920x1080 theres too much white space. I just want the element sizes like fonts to appear bigger so it takes it that unused space and looks ok
[16:47:47] <gzaa> codes quite bad so its difficult to make responsive so i'm looking for an easy way
[16:48:19] <jphase> gzaa: http://foundation.zurb.com
[16:48:33] <jphase> foundation is teh shit when it comes to easy responsive
[16:48:41] <jphase> just have to learn a couple class names
[16:49:06] <gzaa> its only a static website with 4 pages
[16:49:11] <gzaa> i dont want to use a framework :p
[16:49:47] <gzaa> I know i dont have to make it perfect, its just for a local business but i want to make it looks decent at least
[16:49:57] <jphase> usually I just use the minified stylesheet in those cases which I wouldn't quite call a framework in that case but yeah that makes sense
[16:50:29] <jphase> If I could see a working example I could help with your media queries but honestly I think  you're going in the right direction with the media queries
[16:50:31] <gzaa> Any links for that so i can look at it
[16:50:57] <jphase> well I use it on my php framework:  http://ezphp.org
[16:51:11] <gzaa> My next project i'm going to set my divs up write so i can use responsive nice and easily
[16:51:39] <gzaa> right*
[16:51:42] <gzaa> -_-
[16:52:29] <snover> if you are going to do something as an excuse to learn something, please don’t release it as an open-source product…
[16:52:34] <gzaa> Is it similar to a conditional stylesheet?
[16:52:59] <jphase> snover: I will release whatever I want to release, and it's closed source atm so mind your own dude lmao
[16:53:13] <snover> mind my own dude. ok.
[16:53:14] <jphase> some pplz kids, jesus
[16:54:07] <jphase> gzaa: not quite, it just uses classes and media queries (foundation framework that is)
[16:54:09] <gzaa> lol
[16:54:18] <jphase> as opposed to different files based on conditionals
[16:54:20] <gzaa> oh i see
[16:55:08] <gzaa> I was using the skeleton framework at first but i scrapped it
[16:55:14] <gzaa> gumby seems really nice though
[16:55:25] <jphase> yeah, I used to use bootstrap but I fell in love with Foundation's block grid
[16:55:42] <jphase> ul li relationships where it just fits x amount of lis, purdy nifty
[16:55:58] <gzaa> I've never been a fan of grids just seems like your restricted and theres lots of classes i wont use
[16:56:13] <jphase> yeah, most css frameworks that are responsive use them though
[16:56:24] <jphase> foundation at least has a form where you can roll your own margins and such
[16:56:39] <jphase> their download page lets you roll colors, margins, gutter, # of columns, etc.
[16:57:09] <jphase> their JS is a bit buggy (depending on the script) but they're constantly improving it so meh
[16:57:48] <jphase> but yeah gzaa, I wouldn't necessarily use it in every case but lately I've been using foundation and font awesome for most of my projects. makes it easy to hit the ground running with responsive design and vector icons
[16:58:07] <jphase> all a matter of opinion really
[16:58:17] <gzaa> i'll have to take a look at it properly
[16:58:28] <doug65536> gzaa: grids are easier to work with. Also, it limits the complexity of the css when there can't be an infinite number of positions
[16:58:49] <jphase> gotta jet, bye peeps :]
[16:59:00] <gzaa> yeah less bugs etc
[16:59:13] <gzaa> pixal perfect
[16:59:26] <doug65536> gzaa: make a non-grid css layout system. let us know how that works out for you
[17:00:12] <coldhead> can anyone recommend a good mandolin book?
[17:00:14] <coldhead> sorry, wrong window
[17:13:38] <doug65536> What external dependencies are people likely to want on a site like jsfiddle? jquery, jquery ui, jquery mobile, bootstrap. any others?
[17:14:32] <yui_ezequiel> yui
[17:15:42] <doug65536> yui_ezequiel: thanks
[17:17:30] <_rgn> underscore, backbone
[17:19:37] <rdldew> Ok. so I'm trying to use $.each on this array of objects. The objects are duplicated nodes that I've created. I'm keeping these nodes in there as they are duplicated so I can make sure IDs aren't reused and so I can easily remove the duplicated nodes.
[17:19:46] <rdldew> I can't get it to work for some reason.
[17:20:13] <rdldew> Would $.each() be appropriate to check for those objects?
[17:22:58] <doug65536> rdldew: indexOf would be much faster
[17:23:28] <rdldew> Hmm. Let me check out that documentation real quick.
[17:23:30] <doug65536> rdldew: if I understand what you're asking it would be anyway
[17:23:54] <rdldew> I'll clarify, just to be sure. :)
[17:24:50] <rdldew> I created a plugin that when called duplicates a node. I want it to be able to remove nodes as well. If the user clicks a button that happens to be inside of one of the duplicated nodes, it should remove that node. If they click a button outside of one of the nodes, it will just remove the last added node.
[17:26:54] <doug65536> rdldew: a node of the dom right?
[17:27:24] <rdldew> Yeah. I.e $('#nodeToDuplicate).duplicator();
[17:27:46] <doug65536> rdldew: and by "duplicate" you mean .clone() ?
[17:27:50] <rdldew> Yup
[17:27:52] <rdldew> Exactly
[17:27:58] <rdldew> That's one of the things I do inside it.
[17:29:05] <rdldew> http://demo.myradicalsolutions.com/duplicator
[17:29:07] <doug65536> rdldew: so you want a way to quickly see if some dom node has been duplicated already?
[17:29:21] <rdldew> That's the last time I updated it on the site. My workspace is more updated, but not uploaded and not here.
[17:31:48] <doug65536> rdldew: are you asking how you would determine whether they clicked a remove button inside some container or not?
[17:32:39] <doug65536> rdldew: i.e. all of those remove buttons "point" to the same handler
[17:32:45] <rdldew> Yeah. I'm trying to figureout the best way to check whether the item clicked, to remove the duplicate, is inside a duplicate or outside it.
[17:33:15] <doug65536> rdldew: .closest() if you want to work back from the button. .has() if you want to work forward from the container
[17:33:51] <rdldew> Yeah, that was a working method, but that allowed for duplicated IDs.
[17:34:18] <doug65536> buttonTheyClicked.closest(someContainerSelector) ... or $(someContainerSelector).has(buttonTheyClicked)
[17:34:37] <rdldew> Oh yeah, I know. I think that's how it's set up now on the domain I showed you.
[17:34:52] <rigel> ok so
[17:34:58] <rigel> i have this jsfiddle
[17:35:04] <rigel> http://jsfiddle.net/72b7w/2/
[17:35:15] <rigel> and when i put it in my page i think the following is happening
[17:35:30] <rigel> because the thing i'm revealing is not text but an image
[17:35:40] <rdldew> Oh no. The version that's on there is a workaround using .addClass
[17:35:44] <rigel> when the image is reloaded, it re-triggers the ready, which hides everything again
[17:36:12] <rigel> rdldew: are you talking to me?
[17:36:26] <rdldew> No, I wasn't. Sorry.
[17:36:30] <rdldew> But your thing...
[17:36:36] <rigel> oh ok. because my thing uses addClass
[17:36:47] <rdldew> When I click a radio and select show, it shows the hidden item.
[17:37:02] <rdldew> What is the expected behavior?
[17:37:06] <rigel> right, it shows the explanation below, as well as whether the item was wrong
[17:37:14] <rigel> the jsfiddle does this perfectly
[17:37:20] <rdldew> Oh
[17:37:21] <rigel> when i implement this in my page though
[17:37:31] <rigel> instead of a div with text, i am revealing an img
[17:37:48] <rdldew> Are you revealing <img></img> ?
[17:37:48] <rigel> and i think that the load of the image is retriggering the ready function
[17:37:54] <rigel> which hides everything again immediately
[17:37:58] <rigel> yes
[17:38:09] <rigel> i didnt have an image to link to from the jsfiddle
[17:38:16] <rdldew> FYI you don't have to type jQuery in your document. You can put in $
[17:38:23] <doug65536> rigel: use http://placehold.it
[17:39:05] <doug65536> rigel: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/72b7w/4/
[17:40:05] <rigel> ok let me re-edit this to see if i can demonstrate the behavior i'm seeing on my page
[17:41:16] <doug65536> rigel: a more complete placehold.it example, fyi http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/72b7w/5/
[17:41:57] <rdldew> I think he just means when you click 'show' it's supposed to reveal an img
[17:43:06] <doug65536> rdldew: yes, but he's getting strange behavior on the image. having the image on the fiddle might reveal what's going on
[17:43:24] <rdldew> Yeah. I'm interested to see the faulty behavior.
[17:44:14] <rigel> ok, this doesnt show the same thing
[17:44:18] <rigel> so i'm confused.
[17:44:30] <rigel> http://jsfiddle.net/72b7w/6/
[17:44:47] <doug65536> rigel: you only have one question on your real page?
[17:44:49] <rdldew> So it's working in fiddle?
[17:44:54] <rigel> when i press "show" on my page, it will reveal the image and the explanation, but then immediately hide them again
[17:45:08] <rigel> no, i'm using the ui-tabs modeule too
[17:45:10] <rdldew> Can we see the page?
[17:45:12] <rigel> so it's multiple questions
[17:45:22] <rigel> it's not public, just local
[17:45:27] <rdldew> Oh ok.
[17:45:30] <rigel> lemme pastebin it
[17:45:32] <doug65536> rdldew: document ready won't fire multiple times
[17:45:39] <rdldew> Nope
[17:45:50] <doug65536> oops, rigel ^
[17:47:00] <rigel> http://pastebin.com/d3QL9SLq
[17:47:21] <rigel> and i know i should move the js and the css out of the main html file, but thats later
[17:47:56] <rigel> you will probably have to replace placehold.it for the images
[17:48:56] <rdldew> I see what you're saying.
[17:49:08] <rdldew> When you click Show Answer, it immediately shows and disappears.
[17:49:12] <rigel> yeah
[17:49:29] <dse> so I have a php variable enclose a string in single quotes (I can't change this), the string needs to include jQuery, which will include HTML elements with attributes. what quoting style is best to use for the jQuery and HTML?
[17:49:35] <doug65536> rigel: it isn't necessary to hide the p in that explanation div. if the div is hidden, its children are hidden too
[17:49:58] <rigel> doug65536: the explanation is being pulled from an xml file
[17:50:04] <rigel> i'm doing this in xslt
[17:50:21] <rdldew> This may be from inexperience, but I've never seen the $ in this before... jQuery(document).ready(function($)
[17:50:28] <rigel> and the qs/answers are all escaped html
[17:50:48] <rdldew> I usually set up like this... $(document).ready(function(){...});
[17:50:49] <rigel> rdldew: i dont know where i got that from
[17:51:04] <rigel> i am just trying out code snippets from stackexchange and jsfiddle basically
[17:51:10] <rdldew> Ok.
[17:51:11] <doug65536> rdldew: the way he's doing it will work if .noConflict has been used
[17:51:21] <doug65536> jQuery.noConflict()
[17:52:53] <rigel> doug65536: can you explain/linkme?
[17:53:00] <rdldew> I think the problem are the .click() methods being right with the .hide()
[17:53:12] <rdldew> I'm trying something out
[17:53:56] <doug65536> `api noConflict @ rigel
[17:53:56] <b-ot> rigel: No matches.
[17:54:18] * doug65536 gives b-ot the finger
[17:54:20] <doug65536> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[17:55:09] <rigel> yeah, i'm looking at that but not totally understanding. will read more
[17:55:37] <doug65536> rigel: jQuery devs were smart enough to realize that they can't assume that it is ok to use $
[17:56:47] <doug65536> if you do var jQuery_MAN = jQuery.noConflict();     jQuery_MAN.ready(function() { ... });
[17:57:09] <doug65536> now instead of $, it is jQuery_MAN
[17:57:25] <rdldew> It's so much easier to just learn to use $ in place of jQuery.
[17:57:51] <doug65536> rdldew: maybe in a simple imaginary site. in a real site, another library might clobber $
[17:58:09] <rdldew> Yeah, it truly depends on the content and the developer needs.
[17:58:38] <doug65536> rdldew: contrary to popular opinion, jQuery doesn't own $ in all js on earth
[17:58:54] <rdldew> lol
[17:59:59] <doug65536> rdldew: you can even have several versions of jQuery on the same page, using noConflict
[18:00:33] <doug65536> so if there is some mountain of garbage unmaintainable code on a page, but you *need* some functionality that is only in newer jquery, they can coexist
[18:01:13] <doug65536> both versions can't be $
[18:01:47] <rdldew> Good info to know. I haven't thought about that before.
[18:02:52] <kafu> hi, can anyone help me with an ajax error handling problem?
[18:03:50] <rdldew> I'm sure someone can. Not I, unfortunately.
[18:04:04] <kafu> okay, well... i'll try to explain the best I can
[18:04:08] <kafu> hopefully someone has seen this before
[18:04:22] <rigel> rdldew: any luck?
[18:04:33] <rdldew> Oh, no. Sorry.
[18:05:01] <rdldew> I forgot to say that I couldn't figure it out.
[18:05:38] <rdldew> I tried stipping down the jQuery and hiding the div with the content and then tried the click event to show the hidden div, but it didn't work for me.
[18:05:38] <doug65536> kafu: can you show code? at least the ajax request call?
[18:05:54] <rdldew> I could fix that if I had a little more time, but I'm kind of swamped.
[18:06:05] <rigel> what tools are good for debugging this?
[18:06:16] <rdldew> What do you use?
[18:06:21] <rigel> i have no idea
[18:06:26] <rigel> i have never written js before
[18:06:27] <doug65536> rigel: chrome, press F12
[18:06:27] <rdldew> What is your IDE?
[18:06:45] <rdldew> Yeah, that's a very good point. I always have 'Inspect Element' open.
[18:06:49] <rigel> the js console in chrome didnt seem to be helpful. everything just collapses
[18:06:57] <rdldew> If you use Firefox, then make sure you have Firebug installed and running.
[18:06:58] <rigel> maybe im doing it rong
[18:07:13] <kafu> so i've got something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/UrcFr/
[18:07:27] <rdldew> You should step it down a few notches. Get it to it's most basic form and get a single question working with a single answer.
[18:07:37] <doug65536> rigel: go to the sources tab. click the little flyout button at the top left, make sure the sources tab is selected in the flyout, find your source file, click on the line number in the gutter to set a breakpoint, reload the page
[18:07:49] <rdldew> Also, maybe use Aptana for your IDE if you don't have a paid product, like Dreamweaver or Coda.
[18:08:23] <rigel> i'm using vim
[18:08:35] <rdldew> Oh snap
[18:08:40] <rdldew> Linux for the win
[18:08:41] <rigel> no IDEs
[18:09:24] <kafu> basically, trying to POST to a resource based on what the user enters into an input field. and, depending on the resource they submit, it may return an error because the resource is reserved/restricted... so i want to return an error msg and let them enter a new value.
[18:09:28] <rdldew> Check this out: http://www.aptana.com/products/studio3/download
[18:09:44] <doug65536> rigel: I could try to debug your real page. PM me a link if you are wary of posting it publicly
[18:09:56] <kafu> the issue is, when the error msg is sent back, and i go and change the value in the input form and trigger another POST, no request gets made.
[18:09:57] <rdldew> He said it's not live.
[18:10:43] <rigel> doug65536: this is to be rendered by cherrypy on localhost
[18:10:59] <doug65536> rigel: step 1) setup a web host, 2) use a real developer's editor, 3) setup the editor to auto FTP upload on save, 4) win
[18:11:48] <rdldew> Yeah, I would second that. I would definitely get a domain name.
[18:11:58] <rigel> that is not going to happen, because it is not intended for public consumption
[18:12:00] <kafu> the `items` in the data is some data associated with checkboxes the user also selects. i noticed that if i don't change any of the checkboxes, triggering a new POST request won't work. if i uncheck something and recheck it, then try the request, it'll go thru...
[18:12:06] <rigel> the browser is simply a convenient rendering vehicle
[18:12:11] <rdldew> Is it for homework or something?
[18:12:24] <rigel> it is for self-study yes
[18:12:29] <rdldew> Gotcha
[18:13:38] <rigel> i am perfectly capable of setting up a web host etc. plenty of people develop on vim and i have some proficiency with it.
[18:14:06] <doug65536> rigel: sure, and plenty of people walk miles to work
[18:14:06] <rigel> please try to make fewer assumptions
[18:14:20] <jphase> I like vim :]
[18:14:34] <rigel> if you're going to give me grief for my choice of editors or some sort of dick-sizing bullshit then i will ask elsewhere
[18:14:44] <doug65536> do you drive nails in with a big rock or a hammer? rocks drive nails just fine
[18:14:45] <rdldew> Wow rigel
[18:14:49] <rdldew> Take it easy
[18:15:00] <rdldew> Recommendations are recommendations, not insults.
[18:15:38] <rigel> rdldew: "use a real developer's editor" sounds like a recommendation based on a meaningful analysis of my needs?
[18:15:56] <jphase> vim is quite powerful, just frustrating for those too lazy to learn it
[18:16:01] <rdldew> I agree, it could have been worded differently.
[18:17:04] <kafu> doug65536: did you see my jsfiddle at 21:07?
[18:17:38] <doug65536> kafu: I missed it, thanks
[18:18:35] <doug65536> kafu: what is the problem? no error message shown?
[18:18:51] <kafu> let me repost my explanation in one msg... gimme a sec to copy/paste
[18:19:12] <doug65536> kafu: your data doesn't make a lot of sense either
[18:19:30] <kafu> basically, trying to POST to a resource based on what the user enters into an input field. and, depending on the resource they submit, it may return an error because the resource is reserved/restricted... so i want to return an error msg and let them enter a new value. the issue is, when the error msg is sent back, and i go and change the value in the input form and trigger another POST, no request gets made. the `items` in the data is 
[18:19:53] <kafu> ...with checkboxes the user also selects. i noticed that if i don't change any of the checkboxes, triggering a new POST request won't work. if i uncheck something and recheck it, then try the request, it'll go thru...
[18:19:59] <doug65536> kafu: data is key/value pairs, like somekey=somevalue
[18:20:10] <kafu> right, items is some JSON i've built up.
[18:20:23] <kafu> trust me that the data and the request works
[18:20:36] <kafu> my issue is with trying to re-submit the request
[18:20:44] <kafu> when an error occurs.
[18:21:45] <kafu> the weird behavior is the checking and unchecking of items and then the re-submit works.
[18:22:09] <doug65536> kafu: ah ok, I missed the contentType
[18:22:59] <kafu> i return a 403 when the resource being POSTed to is restricted, so i was thinking that maybe jQuery won't resubmit the request... but I do change the value in tagForm, so the request URL is now different.
[18:23:40] <doug65536> kafu: jquery will submit a request every time you ask
[18:23:46] <kafu> okay
[18:24:00] <kafu> even if it's a 403 and the data hasn't changed?
[18:24:13] <kafu> dunno if it tries to be smart about that
[18:25:08] <doug65536> kafu: 403 means forbidden. do you mean 304?
[18:25:36] <doug65536> 304 Not Modified
[18:25:58] <kafu> nope, 403. api/tag/:sometag/items may be restricted
[18:26:14] <kafu> :sometag is based on the user's input
[18:26:36] <kafu> if they choose a reserved tag, i return a 403
[18:27:00] <doug65536> kafu: ok, 403 ... data hasn't changed threw me off
[18:28:09] <kafu> yeah, sorry. i meant data being submitted hasn't changed. so maybe jquery's like... "you're trying to send the same thing" so you're probably gonna get a 403 again.
[18:28:11] <doug65536> kafu: you checked the error console right?
[18:28:15] <kafu> yep.
[18:28:22] <kafu> no errors.
[18:28:34] <kafu> i get the first 403 error and see the msg, and no JS errors.
[18:28:39] <doug65536> kafu: did you put a breakpoint before the ajax call and make sure your values are what you expect?
[18:29:37] <doug65536> kafu: can you use a POST request?
[18:30:00] <kafu> i am using a POST request
[18:30:09] <doug65536> kafu: then there's no caching possible
[18:30:23] <kafu> ok
[18:30:43] <doug65536> I'm lost in a sea of browser tabs here. I can't find your paste :)
[18:31:38] <kafu> the fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/UrcFr/
[18:31:53] <doug65536> yes thanks
[18:32:42] <doug65536> kafu: check the network tab in your browser and confirm that a new request is sent each time
[18:32:49] <kafu> it's not.
[18:32:50] <doug65536> in your browser's debugger
[18:33:00] <kafu> once i receive the error, i can't make anymore requests
[18:33:14] <kafu> that's the issue.
[18:33:16] <kafu> :\
[18:33:34] <doug65536> kafu: no, I'm pretty sure you're convinced of that and it's making you blind to look for the real problem
[18:34:00] <kafu> i've looked at the network tab
[18:34:08] <kafu> my autocomplete ajax call still works after i've received the error
[18:34:09] <doug65536> kafu: did you put a breakpoint at the $.ajax call and make sure it reaches that line each time?
[18:34:15] <kafu> it doesn't
[18:34:29] <doug65536> ok, then your theory makes no sense
[18:34:30] <kafu> only the first time i trigger the $.ajax call does it hit the breakpoint
[18:34:39] <doug65536> how can it ignore subsequent ajax calls that aren't issued
[18:34:52] <kafu> true.
[18:34:54] <kafu> :P
[18:35:25] <doug65536> kafu: stop looking at the $.ajax call and see why your code path doesn't reach it
[18:35:39] <kafu> doing that now.
[18:35:42] <kafu> thanks.
[18:35:54] <duch_kazatel> hah i just had one of those moments.  beeing staring at the trees too much, so-to-speak
[18:36:23] <kafu> yeah. it's been a long Monday
[18:36:40] <duch_kazatel> rewriting this library has been a massive PITa.
[18:43:58] <doug65536> _rgn: I noticed that cdn of backbone has backbone.js and several backbone-something.js   Is backbone.js the full version and those are components, or are the backbone-something files plugins
[18:44:40] <doug65536> _rgn: for example, backbone-forms.js
[19:09:31] <esas> Is it possible to get all img elements where the full image path ends with .thumb, or do I need to go through each img element on the page?
[19:10:17] <jphase> esas: try $('img[src$=.thumb]')
[19:10:34] <jphase> might need some quotes or something I can't remember...
[19:10:47] <jphase> $("img[src$='.thumb']") perhaps
[19:12:10] <jphase> esas: my example is where the src ends with .thumb though, so that'd be the image extension in this case. There is also *= for "anywhere in the src there's a .thumb". Anything else might require a loop yeah
[19:13:27] <esas> jphase: Thanks! It worked with quotes :)
[19:13:39] <jphase> w00t
[19:14:36] <kafu> doug65536: got my code working, thanks for your help :)
[19:15:30] <doug65536> kafu: np
[19:35:36] <b-lew> http://nafissa.jenbourn.com/page-with-subs -> I'm adding a class .js-superfish at if the window is greater than 600 and removing it if its less than 600… I'm trying to get the sub-menu to display block so its not hidden in my mobile menu am I calling the wrong class? I've tried a few things and am not having much luck.
[19:36:47] <Ububegin> I have a few charts in my webpage.. Is there some html samples to place the charts nicely on the site ?
[19:46:34] <jphase> Ububegin: not sure if you're in the right channel really and your question is kinda vague.
[19:47:17] <itsrummy> hello, does anyone have a working example on how to use the pageshow event in jquerymobile 1.3.2 ?
[19:47:24] <itsrummy> my code from earlier versions no longer works
[19:48:03] <Ububegin> jphase: I thought of using Jquery UI's accordian to display the charts.. But was wondering if there was some other nice layouts instead..
[19:48:33] <Ububegin> jphase: I should be looking at css layouts, is it ??
[19:49:28] <jphase> Ububegin: Sure, you could UI tabs, UI accordion, another library, or do something custom
[19:50:28] <jphase> itsrummy: http://jsfiddle.net/olli/4rQRb/
[19:51:22] <Ububegin> jphase: not really a designer.. so was generally browsing for ideas... Currently I just placed all the charts inside <div> tags from top to bottom.. and the layout looks kinda fugly
[19:53:41] <itsrummy> jphase: is there a way to get pageshow to work when page_1 is shown?
[19:53:53] <itsrummy> from what i can tell, that code will run whichever page is displayed
[19:54:07] <jphase> Ububegin: There's all sorts of things you can use. You could even use Foundation's orbit with HTML (second method) http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/orbit.html or use cycle, or all sorts of things really
[19:54:21] <itsrummy> in earlier versions we could do something like $("#page_1").live("pageshow", functio(event) { alert("do stuff"); });
[19:54:33] <itsrummy> in 1.3.2 this no longer works
[19:55:29] <jphase> itsrummy: .on replaced .live
[19:55:41] <itsrummy> yeah, i've read the documentation
[19:55:46] <itsrummy> on does not work
[19:55:58] <jphase> I think there's also .delegate too
[19:56:03] <jphase> I never use that one though
[19:56:40] <jphase> itsrummy: are you trying to bind an event on a dynamically loaded element or something?
[19:57:00] <itsrummy> jphase: yep. when i show a page, i want to do stuff to it
[19:57:12] <itsrummy> been workig fine all the way since 1.0 betas
[19:58:04] <Ububegin> jphase: whats cycle ?
[19:58:21] <jphase> itsrummy: hmm, you tried .bind ? out of curiosity?
[19:58:30] <itsrummy> no i have not
[19:58:34] <itsrummy> lemme see
[19:58:40] <jphase> Ububegin: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[19:59:42] <jphase> itsrummy: if that doesn't work then try putting your code in a .load wrapper:  $(window).load(function(){ // your code });
[20:01:10] <Ububegin> jphase: hmm, I want to display all the charts at once.. just want to lay them nicely on the site..
[20:01:30] <itsrummy> jphase: i have tried to setup pageshow in the "mobileinit" event, which i have never previously needed to do. i can see mobileinit runs, but it seems my pageshow events are never run. I have also just tried with bind, and no good. bind/live/on all seem to do nothing.
[20:03:14] <jphase> itsrummy: I'm not entirely sure. I'm not a jqmobile guru though by any means. Have you tried the .load wrapper I just mentioned?
[20:03:51] <itsrummy> no not yet
[20:04:34] <jphase> Ububegin: There's probably an infinite amount of design concepts you could use. Accordion might be a good idea but they're not all displayed at the same time that way either really. Perhaps try going with a responsive design approach or maybe if you want to get fancy use jQuery masonry:  http://masonry.desandro.com/
[20:06:12] <itsrummy> jphase: looks like having a lot more like using $(window).load ...
[20:06:58] <jphase> itsrummy: If window load works for you, you might be able to limit that to your page1 element like $('#page1').load(function(){ // blah });
[20:07:17] <jphase> it just ensures the element and all child elements are fully loaded before firing
[20:07:29] <itsrummy> jphase: let me try that
[20:08:47] <Agamemnus> so, .load works on things that aren't the window object?
[20:09:44] <jphase> Agamemnus: yeah, kinda neat
[20:09:48] <jphase> any selector really
[20:09:53] <Ububegin> jphase: nice links... though they seem a bit overkill for my site.. I have 2 charts and 1 table and filter form which refreshes the charts and table via ajax..
[20:09:54] <jphase> $('img').load
[20:10:09] <Agamemnus> I can't get it to work.
[20:10:13] <Agamemnus> Heh.
[20:10:34] <jphase> Agamemnus: hmm, what's not working exactly? Event isn't firing?
[20:10:39] <Agamemnus> right.
[20:10:59] <Agamemnus> var loop_page = blah.cloneNode (); $(loop_page).load (function() {alert (304)})
[20:11:01] <jphase> hrm, you haz code sample?
[20:11:03] <Agamemnus> doesn't work
[20:11:05] <jphase> oh
[20:11:28] <jphase> well that's a dynamically created element
[20:11:36] <itsrummy> jphase: i will show you what I have, which now works, in just a second
[20:11:37] <jphase> I'm talking about elements already on the page
[20:11:41] <itsrummy> thank you for your assistance
[20:11:55] <jphase> itsrummy: oh I was talking to Agamemnus, but you can show if you need
[20:11:57] <Agamemnus> is there any jquery function i can use for a dynamically created element?
[20:12:12] <jphase> Agamemnus: just chain it after your clone
[20:12:13] <itsrummy> oh, i didnt notice. I just thought i would share my solution
[20:12:21] <itsrummy> no doubt someone else will run into the same problem
[20:12:33] <Agamemnus> that's no good, because i need to wait for images to load.
[20:12:56] <itsrummy> http://pastebin.com/D3NHtMx4
[20:13:23] <jphase> Agamemnus: you need to fire an event after the images in your dynamic element are loaded?
[20:13:29] <Agamemnus> yes
[20:13:49] <Agamemnus> i could iterate through all the image descendants and do a callback, but not sure how to handle background images
[20:13:51] <itsrummy> jphase: i think this seems okay, it certainly works. i have been banging away at this since monday arvo AU time :-)
[20:14:16] <Agamemnus> guess i could create a temporary image for those
[20:14:16] <jphase> Agamemnus: I'd declare your own method and chain it...      $.fn.fireme = function(){  // do something }
[20:14:41] <jphase> Agamemnus: then do your $('div#mydiv').clone().appendTo('body').fireme();
[20:14:51] <jphase> Agamemnus: make sure you define your method before you clone your elements
[20:15:30] <Agamemnus> I don't like chaining.
[20:15:38] <jphase> Agamemnus: then you shouldn't be using jquery :P
[20:15:47] <Agamemnus> the idea here is to find a function that figures out when things are loaded.
[20:15:53] <Agamemnus> i don't want to make it myself.
[20:15:54] <Agamemnus> :(
[20:16:51] <jphase> Agamemnus: well .load will natively do that, you could also probably just add a .load (chained) after you create your element
[20:17:18] <Agamemnus> but you said it yourself, it doesn't work on dynamically created elements... or wait, will that work only when I attach it to the body?
[20:17:20] <jphase> and to clarify, there's nothing wrong with method chaining unless you're required otherwise by an assignment or something
[20:17:31] <jphase> Agamemnus: yeah
[20:17:42] <Agamemnus> actually i think it is already attached.
[20:17:46] <Agamemnus> so it is like this
[20:18:12] <Agamemnus> body > somestuff > mydiv... and i just append mydiv to somestuff.
[20:18:14] <jphase> you MIGHT be able to also do a .clone().appendTo('body').load(function(){ //blah });  but I've never really tried that b44
[20:18:16] <jphase> -4
[20:18:18] <Agamemnus> but no load event is fired
[20:18:37] <jphase> Agamemnus: hmm, can you jsfiddle?
[20:18:38] <Agamemnus> or does it have to be directly on the body element?
[20:18:54] <jphase> Agamemnus: you should be able to bind events to the element before you append it
[20:19:00] <Ububegin> jphase: thanks again.. will browse around for a while
[20:19:17] <jphase> $('<div>').click(function(){ alert('blah'); }).appendTo('body');
[20:19:45] <scathen^C> hey all, is there a way to stop event propagation without access to an event object? like stop all event propagation?
[20:19:47] <jphase> Ububegin: sure man, you might have better luck in like #css or something
[20:20:17] <Agamemnus> still not loading
[20:20:34] <jphase> scathen^C: Something beyond this?   http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[20:20:34] <Agamemnus> pointer-events:none
[20:20:52] <Agamemnus> only in IE11 though, out of the IEs
[20:20:55] <Agamemnus> I believe
[20:21:20] <jphase> Agamemnus: Hmm, test your jQuery in a real browser, afterwards test in IE ;]
[20:22:14] <scathen^C> jphase: that seems to work in chrome, but in firefox i get event is not defined?
[20:23:14] <scathen^C> nvm: i think something is broken with jquery in firefox...
[20:23:18] <jphase> scathen^C: yeah
[20:23:29] <jphase> was gonna say, if jquery works it should too :\
[20:23:45] <HarryPitfall> $('body').on('the_event_you_want_to_stop', '*', function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); });
[20:24:10] <scathen^C> i am getting a jquery error in firefox: too much recursion, but the same code works in chrome....any ideas where to start with debugging?
[20:24:31] <jphase> scathen^C: you have any ^=, *=, $= selectors?
[20:24:47] <scathen^C> im using jquery on top of angular, so not sure
[20:24:58] <Agamemnus> I know, I was talking about pointer-events:none
[20:25:25] <jphase> ohhh, gotcha
[20:25:29] <jphase> that makes sense
[20:25:43] <jphase> poor IE and its shortcomings can't hang :[
[20:27:22] <Agamemnus> i give up, i am making an on_all_images_loaded function.
[20:28:33] <jphase> Agamemnus: That's what I was doing with the method I gave you above. Since it's dynamic, you'll need to bind your function to the element before you insert it. Or at least that's what I do any how
[20:28:44] <Agamemnus> i tried to, didn't work
[20:28:50] <jphase> oh that same one didn't work?
[20:28:57] <jphase> lemme try a fiddle then
[20:29:11] <Agamemnus> i did add the load event before appending to the body
[20:29:48] <jphase> oh that might not work, I've never tried that
[20:29:52] <jphase> it was a hunch that it may work hehe
[20:33:16] <bluesm_> Channel for jquery mobile ?
[20:35:11] <coldhead> that would be here, bluesm_
[20:35:15] <Platz> $.ajax will not follow 302 redirects, correct?
[20:35:26] <bluesm_> coldhead: Here ?
[20:39:17] <bluesm_> " attribute. jQuery Mobile will apply all the necessary styles to transform the list into a mobile-friendly listview with right arrow indicator that fills the full width of the browser window. "
[20:39:27] <bluesm_> What is "arrow indicator" ?
[20:40:34] <Agamemnus> you're not reading
[20:40:38] <Agamemnus> "right arrow indicator"
[20:40:40] <Agamemnus> >
[20:41:06] <Agamemnus> a list with a right arrow indicator.
[20:41:32] <Agamemnus> it's missing an "a".
[20:43:14] <jphase> hmm
[20:43:23] <jphase> Agamemnus: is this working?  I can't tell lmao  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/pwJNN/3/
[20:44:38] <jphase> bluesm_: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0/docs/lists/docs-lists.html   the little right > chevron arrows
[20:44:49] <jphase> icons
[20:45:34] <jphase> Agamemnus: disregard that top function
[20:45:55] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/pwJNN/4/ perhaps
[20:46:49] <jphase> Agamemnus: here, actually, here's an updated one with a larger image size so you can tell the event is firing at the right time:  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/pwJNN/5/
[20:52:10] <Agamemnus> here is what i coded
[20:52:33] <Agamemnus> no idea dude, just didn't work
[20:52:39] <Agamemnus> whatever, re-invented the wheel
[20:52:55] <Agamemnus> http://jsfiddle.net/wWhpM/
[20:53:16] <Agamemnus> with an expire time... so it is even better
[20:53:19] <Agamemnus> maybe
[20:53:20] <bluesm_> jphase: Thanks :)
[20:53:21] <Agamemnus> or maybe not
[20:53:24] <Agamemnus> nobody knows
[20:54:40] <echosystm> does anyone know of a way to get all data attributes as a map?
[20:55:02] <echosystm> eg. <a ... data-a="1" data-b="2"> into { a: 1, b: 2}
[20:56:04] <Agamemnus> you already have the object?
[20:56:18] <Agamemnus> loop through its attributes, parse it.. create an object
[20:56:18] <echosystm> huh?
[20:56:25] <Agamemnus> dead
[20:56:42] <Agamemnus> i forgot that this is jquery..
[20:56:55] <echosystm> i meant is there some function like data() that doesnt take any arguments and just returns them all
[20:56:56] <Agamemnus> i'm telling you how to do it with Javascript.
[20:57:21] <Agamemnus> dunno mate
[20:58:01] <jphase> echosystm:  hmm, that's a toughy
[20:59:17] <echosystm> lol
[20:59:25] <echosystm> ok my bad, i read the docs wrong
[20:59:33] <echosystm> the data() method does what i need
[21:02:43] <jphase> oh nice
[21:06:58] <doug65536> echosystm: make sure your code can handle unexpected stuff in the data you get back. plugins use .data extensively
[21:07:29] <doug65536> echosystm: hopefully you want it for debugging only
[21:17:00] <raj> is attr('checked') or prop('checked') preferred?
[21:17:49] <jphase> raj: are you setting or getting?
[21:18:05] <raj> getting, but why is setting different?
[21:18:29] <jphase> well just cause I'd recommend using .is(':checked') instead for getting
[21:18:38] <raj> why?
[21:18:57] <shoky> raj: prop
[21:19:08] <jphase> well html5 can have <input type="checkbox" checked>  as opposed to older  <input type="checkbox" checked="checked" />
[21:19:25] <raj> I thought the latter was newer
[21:19:28] <raj> and preferred
[21:19:32] <shoky> prop would work fine for either
[21:19:35] <jphase> prop is newer and preferred
[21:20:05] <jphase> but if you just wanted to check if an alement is checked, .is(':checked') works easiest imo
[21:20:15] <jphase> or not even .is if you do it in the selector
[21:20:22] <shoky> prop is quicker
[21:20:29] <raj> good reason
[21:20:52] <shoky> .is(':checked') would just end up checking the property anyway
[21:20:53] <jphase> $('input:checked') = quicker than looping through each element and checking .prop return values isn't it shoky ?
[21:21:29] <shoky> jphase it's the same
[21:21:42] <jphase> oh, then prop isn't quicker?
[21:22:00] <jphase> I mean, I know jQuery :checked loops through stuff an does .prop anyhow
[21:22:08] <shoky> prop is quicker than .is
[21:22:11] <jphase> but isn't it quicker just to type it in the selector (for the programmer)?
[21:22:35] <shoky> you're asking a diff question..
[21:22:43] <shoky> $('input:checked') doesn't use .is
[21:23:16] <jphase> http://jsperf.com/prop-vs-ischecked/5
[21:23:23] <jphase> I didn't say it did shoky lol
[21:23:41] <raj> why does http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5874652/prop-vs-attr suggest using `if ( $("#cb").attr("checked") == "checked" ) {...}` instead of `if ( $("#cb").attr("checked") === "checked" ) {...}`
[21:23:46] <raj> the number of equal signs differs
[21:24:16] <shoky> raj attr is wrong. in old jquery it was the way to set the property, though
[21:24:39] <shoky> raj use prop, forget about it ;p
[21:24:49] <raj> kk :)
[21:25:37] <jphase> .checked is the fastest if you want to get all nerdy about it though ;)
[21:25:52] <shoky> indeed, that's direct access to the property
[21:26:12] <Platz> will $.ajax follow or not follow 302 redirects?
[21:26:36] <jphase> I'm curious what the selector actually does (not using .is). Do you know shoky?
[21:27:09] <jphase> does $('input:checked') loop through each element and check for .checked I wonder?
[21:27:23] <raj> shoky, so how would you programattically change whether a checkbox is checked or not?
[21:27:29] <shoky> jphase: yes, pretty sure that's what happens
[21:27:34] <raj> sorry, I mean a radio button
[21:27:37] <jphase> gotcha
[21:27:53] <raj> .prop('checked', 'checked')?
[21:27:56] <shoky> raj: .prop('checked', true)
[21:27:56] <jphase> yeah
[21:27:59] <shoky> true/false
[21:28:01] <jphase> oh that too
[21:28:08] <raj> ah, gotcha
[21:28:11] <raj> thank you sir
[21:28:15] <jphase> hmm, enlightening... I need to start usig booleans there
[21:28:22] <jphase> I'm still accustomed to the old approach
[21:28:26] <shoky> Np my only mobile bud
[21:30:50] <raj> lol
[21:35:16] <echosystm> is there any selector that can be used instead of .parent() ?
[21:35:45] <echosystm> eg. $('#something').find(':parent') instead of $('#something').parent()
[21:36:20] <shoky> not really
[21:36:28] <echosystm> dang
[21:36:42] <shoky> but maybe you're looking for .closest(selector)
[21:36:52] <shoky> ?closest
[21:36:58] <shoky> ?api closest
[21:36:59] <b-ot> shoky: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[21:37:44] <aro> $('.shopping-cart-product:last-child').addClass('add-bottom');  <-- why isnt this working?
[21:37:54] <aro> am i doing something wrong? it doesnt error.. just doesnt add the class
[21:38:40] <shoky> aro the code looks fine, without seeing the DOM tree
[21:38:45] <echosystm> thanks shoky !
[21:39:43] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/tc7EV/
[21:39:48] <aro> see example there
[21:41:06] <shoky> aro
[21:41:10] <shoky> ?api :last-child
[21:41:11] <b-ot> shoky: :last-child Selector: Selects all elements that are the last child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/last-child-selector/
[21:41:22] <shoky> that div is not the last child of its parent
[21:42:04] <aro> shouldnt the selector make it only select that one though?
[21:42:19] <shoky> no. the selector does what the docs say it does
[21:42:29] <shoky> which is select only elements that are the last child of their parents
[21:42:53] <shoky> you can use :last instead
[21:43:22] <aro> ok
[21:43:37] <aro> cool that works
[21:43:46] <shoky> really, it's not working for me for some reason
[21:44:30] <shoky> oh im dumb.
[21:44:44] <shoky> i didn't click ;D
[21:44:59] <jphase> hehe
[21:45:02] <aro> hehe
[21:47:32] <raj> is there an alternative to `name` attribute that I can use on a <p> tag?
[21:47:41] <raj> class isn't useful because multiple classes may be present
[21:47:59] <raj> i know there's data-*
[21:48:00] <shoky> data-name ?
[21:48:35] <raj> reason is cuz then I have to the data category something weird so there's no future conflict with scripts in the future
[21:49:43] <shoky> uhm well you can name it data-whateveryouwant-name
[21:49:59] <raj> ya
[21:50:00] <shoky> or if you dont care about validation or stuff like that you can name it whatever you want
[21:50:01] <raj> fine
[21:50:04] <shoky> even name
[21:50:19] <shoky> what's this name for?
[21:50:24] <raj> and be shunned from #html?
[21:50:26] <raj> I don't think so
[21:50:33] <shoky> heh
[21:51:02] <raj> so I can use an associative array object to fill in some profile information
[21:51:19] <raj> where the `name` attribute of the element would serve as the `key` for the object
[21:51:52] <raj> cuz there are `inputs` and radio buttons with `name` attributes
[21:58:28] <prefixed> hey. If I create a variable that selects a certain id (ex someVar = $(#someId)), I should be able to do something useful when someone clicks on that ID, right? (ex someVar.click(function() { do some stuff });)
[21:58:44] <raj> yes
[21:58:49] <prefixed> hm
[21:59:24] <prefixed> ah ok. I see what I screwed up
[22:00:39] <prefixed> now, if I wanted to make a banner appear in the middle of the page when someone clicks on a specific element, what would I need to do? specifically, where would I need to store the banner, and what sort of display options would I want to change upon element click?
[22:06:38] <raj> shoky, and then use .attr('data-profile-key') for getting?
[22:06:42] <prefixed> would I want to include the banner in every page as an element with 0height and 0 width and then adjust it on click?
[22:07:16] <jphase> prefixed: with overflow hidden yeah
[22:07:27] <jphase> well, not necessary actually nvm
[22:07:42] <jphase> I'm thinking parent containers
[22:08:48] <bluesm_> With jquery mobile, should I use "<a> elements in lists ?
[22:09:05] <bluesm_> When it doesn't redirect to another page ? But just do somthing ?
[22:11:02] <shoky> raj: i'd use .data('profile-key')
[22:11:31] <raj> I had to hardcode data attribute into the html
[22:11:43] <jphase> bluesm_: well you can do that with jQuery in general. <a id="foo" href="javascript:void(0)">Click</a>    and then bind an event to the element
[22:12:11] <bluesm_> jphase: It is considered as "obtrusive" :P
[22:12:30] <jphase> oh?
[22:12:56] <bluesm_> jphase: Probably you're right, but I mean the good code, with good "semantics". <a> for me have meaning of "redirecting to another page" or to anchor.
[22:13:09] <bluesm_> jphase: Not just to trigger some JavaScript.
[22:14:30] <jphase> ajaxLinksEnabled ?
[22:16:03] <jphase> data-ajax="false" or something?
[22:17:17] <prefixed> ok
[22:17:31] <prefixed> how can I get an element to appear when a user clicks another element on a page?
[22:18:08] <jphase> $('#clickElement').click(function(){ $('#otherElement).fadeIn(); });
[22:18:22] <prefixed> jphase that doesn't appear to work
[22:18:26] <jphase> or .animate({height: '100px'}, 400) or whatever?
[22:18:47] <prefixed> jphase the thing is, I need the second (banner) element to be hidden at first
[22:18:58] <prefixed> I am using display:none;
[22:19:03] <prefixed> perhaps that's the problem?
[22:19:16] <jphase> well display none won't work with your height method
[22:19:53] <jphase> you could sloppily use .show().animate({height: '100px'}, 500)   or something too but it'd be best to just have height: 0  by default
[22:19:56] <prefixed> I basically want to display an overlay on the page when someone clicks a specific element
[22:20:14] <prefixed> what is the "preferred" method for doing this
[22:20:44] <jphase> prefixed: can you jsfiddle this? overlay is much different than what I'm imagining when you describe a height: 0 element
[22:20:58] <prefixed> ignore the height:0
[22:22:34] <prefixed> jphase something like this http://jsfiddle.net/3XwZv/71/
[22:23:40] <jphase> I'm confused where the overlay comes in... are you wanting to make a lightboxy effect?
[22:25:11] <prefixed> basically, yeah
[22:25:33] <prefixed> so, #bank-btn would have a background image set up
[22:25:39] <prefixed> it would also have a height
[22:27:31] <austinbv> is there a way to see if a button is clicked, at the moment I am watching for mousedown/up events but if someone moves their mouse out of the window the up is not triggered.  Native browser <button> elements do still change state though and display.
[22:28:03] <rigel> in chrome is there a way to see the content of my post requests
[22:28:50] <austinbv> rigel: developer tools
[22:28:57] <austinbv> network tab
[22:34:43] <jphase> prefixed: try something like http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/HKGVn/2/
[22:35:18] <jphase> uber-basic lightboxish thingamajigger ;]
[22:35:31] <prefixed> sec
[22:35:43] <prefixed> yep, that looks correct
[22:35:43] <prefixed> sec
[22:36:29] <jphase> oh, you can remove the .animate from the lboverlay click there, it's pointless cause the .hide
[22:36:38] <prefixed> ok sec
[22:42:32] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/5PtyF/4/ -- there's suppose to be a span over the image showing a play button indicating it's a YouTube video. But how come I can't seem to set the span's height at line 33?
[22:43:13] <prefixed> jphase uh oh
[22:43:26] <prefixed> I think my problem is that I wasn't waiting till the doucment was ready
[22:44:52] <prefixed> yep
[22:44:53] <prefixed> that was it
[22:44:55] <prefixed> durrrr
[22:47:40] <jphase> doh
[22:48:48] <jphase> boytoy: change your .height on line 25 to something other than auto
[22:49:41] <jphase> 220 seems to look decentish
[22:50:37] <jphase> boytoy: also, you may want to combine your css declarations in one method using object notation:   .css({ width: 300, height: 220})
[22:52:32] <prefixed> jphase what's wrong here
[22:52:32] <prefixed> $(document).not(mediaPlayerInstructions, mediaPlayerHelpBanner).click(function() {
[22:52:33] <prefixed> $(mediaPlayerInstructions).animate({ opacity: 0 }, 200).hide();
[22:52:33] <prefixed> });
[22:52:59] <prefixed> I am trying to hide the element once someone clicks elswehre on the screen
[22:53:00] <jphase> i have no idea about what's going on in the .not() there but I never use that
[22:53:12] <jphase> so I might just be a nub in your specific example
[22:53:44] <jphase> ohhh I see
[22:53:48] <jphase> mediaPlayerInstructions and mediaPlayerHelpBanner are elements
[22:53:59] <jphase> sorry, 2 too many bong rips
[22:54:05] <prefixed> yolo
[22:54:16] <prefixed> yeah
[22:54:21] <prefixed> they're divs
[22:54:26] <prefixed> literal strings in this case
[22:54:28] <jphase> well, you don't need to animate AND .hide
[22:54:36] <jphase> hide will trigger first
[22:54:52] <jphase> I did the same thing in my fiddle I gave you but I was wrong
[22:55:08] <jphase> what's happening with it? some problem? you have fiddle?
[22:55:27] <prefixed> no fiddle. it's just not hiding the overlay
[22:56:01] <prefixed> baiscally, that code states that someone should be able to click anywhere else on the page to make the banner go away
[22:59:04] <boytoy> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/cjBN2/ -- how do I listen in on a textarea and alert the user if she enters something specific?
[23:00:12] <jphase> prefixed:  well I suppose you could do something like $(window).click(function(){ if($('.overlay').css('opacity') != 0){ $('.overlay').hide(); } });
[23:00:43] <prefixed> wtf is going on here
[23:00:55] <jphase> lol
[23:01:17] <prefixed> okg
[23:01:18] <prefixed> sec
[23:01:19] <jphase> it just binds to the entire window's click event, checks if the something with class="overlay" has an opacity > 0, and then hides it
[23:02:01] <jphase> boytoy: do you mean anything with <iframe.........></iframe> ?
[23:05:45] <boytoy> jphase: yep
[23:06:07] <prefixed> uh
[23:06:15] <prefixed> there is some serious fuckery going on here
[23:06:43] <jphase> prefixed: if that's running in a fiddle it may act funny
[23:07:47] <Cork> prefixed: you don't want to bind it like that
[23:07:58] <prefixed> ?
[23:08:10] <Cork> prefixed: $(document) is one element
[23:08:21] <Cork> .not(element, element) will not remove anything as you only have document
[23:08:30] <prefixed> ok
[23:08:40] <jphase> boytoy:  you need some regex magic my friend :]     http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/cjBN2/2/
[23:08:43] <prefixed> so how do I match everything BUT a couple elements?
[23:08:59] <jphase> prefixed: :not()
[23:09:14] <irkaacis> good morning, I was whining about this yesterday too - http://pastebin.com/7GwX80Yr
[23:09:14] <jphase> boytoy: notice that you didn't have an event either, I binded your stuff to .keyup
[23:09:18] <Cork> what you want to do is $(document).click(function(event) { if(!$(element, element).has(event.target)) {} })
[23:09:37] <prefixed> ok
[23:09:46] <irkaacis> here what am I doing wrong? Browser says that 'object has no method fancybox'
[23:09:56] <boytoy> jphase: oooh lah lah, works excellent this one =)
[23:10:01] <jphase> irkaacis: fancybox library isn't included or not included before your call
[23:10:07] <jphase> boytoy:  ;)
[23:10:12] <boytoy> jphase: thank you!
[23:10:41] <jphase> boytoy:  hehe, no problem. The more stuff you need to match the more regex stuff you'll need.
[23:11:03] <irkaacis> jphase, hmm, when I open js console in page and write $.fancybox it exists
[23:11:19] <irkaacis> but still even then I cannot add it to any element
[23:11:22] <irkaacis> I feel dumb
[23:11:25] <irkaacis> it has always worked
[23:11:41] <jphase> irkaacis:  that only means that it's loaded on the page, not before your .fancybox call ;)
[23:12:06] <jphase> irkaacis: your script tag for fancybox needs to be before your .fancybox() call
[23:12:28] <sylflo> hi
[23:12:39] <jphase> hi
[23:13:18] <jphase> irkaacis: sometimes a JS error can break things below it though so check your console as well
[23:13:34] <irkaacis> jphase I am checking it all the time
[23:14:08] <jphase> irkaacis: If you make a jsfiddle I'll help you debug
[23:14:17] <boytoy> jphase: this oughta do. im using jquery embedly to autoembed urls and treat them nicely -- http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/HdMTU/5 -- problem is that jquery embedly doesnt know how to process real embed code so i figured better just try to avoid it altogether
[23:14:31] <irkaacis> I dont know how to use jsfiddle,, how to embed fancybox lib there?
[23:14:38] <echosystm> is there any way to run some code every time a certain type of element is added to the dom?
[23:14:59] <jphase> sheesh boytoy, that urlRe:  is regex I assume?
[23:15:06] <jphase> my goodness
[23:15:23] <jphase> yeah I see it now
[23:15:29] <jphase> took my eyes a sec to adjust hehe
[23:16:05] <jphase> boytoy: I'd start with a very simple regex and see if it matches at all. Like start with something like /blah/ and then paste blah in the box
[23:16:09] <prefixed> Cork is this valid: if ($(e.target).not(mediaPlayerInstructions))
[23:16:26] <jphase> boytoy: oh, also... you may want to put a /gi at the end instead of just /i
[23:16:31] <Cork> prefixed: yes, and no
[23:16:43] <Cork> prefixed: it will filter the target if it is in the variable
[23:16:57] <Cork> prefixed: but as the target can only be one element that won't ever work
[23:17:03] <boytoy> jphase: cool will do
[23:17:06] <Cork> prefixed: or rather it will be pointless
[23:17:09] <prefixed> ah
[23:17:14] <Cork> prefixed: .is is prob what you want
[23:17:21] <prefixed> gotta use a bang with is then huh?
[23:17:22] <jphase> boytoy: I don't use embedly very much so I'm not too familiar
[23:17:25] <prefixed> ok
[23:17:37] <Cork> prefixed: though remember that target is the top most element
[23:17:38] <prefixed> JAVASCRIPT U WILL B THE END OF ME
[23:18:04] <Cork> prefixed: so that test won't work if you have children inside mediaPlayerInstructions
[23:18:43] <prefixed> hm
