[00:26:59] <Hilton> Lies.
[01:01:49] <fabioportieri> i have a div loaded with dynamic content.. problem is this div is setting the height with a value too large for the content loaded in.. how can i fix this? in my css i do not explicity set an height
[01:04:35] <fabioportieri> nevermind found it
[01:42:32] <bigbugjava> Hi I'm getting a list from s3 bucket, with pictures inside, want to display them on jquery imange slider, any recommendations?
[01:49:50] <rivarun> hey all. i have a page that's quite jquery heavy - loading all the javascript takes 3-4 seconds, so i'm trying to get the entire page to fade in /after/ everything else has finished, but i'm not sure how i'd go about waiting on all the functions that run
[01:50:29] <rivarun> i've seen this happen for buttons, ajax and other small things, but i have hundreds of things loading here
[01:51:08] <bigbugjava> rivarun why not use CSS to show up loading untill everything is loaded?
[01:51:54] <rivarun> bigbugjava: that's what i have at this point. everything hidden with css and i then want to fadeIn() with jquery. but it runs while everything else is also loading, crippling the animation
[01:51:57] <bigbugjava> you can setTimeout(function (){}, 2000);
[01:52:31] <rivarun> bigbugjava: i can't know how long it will take. the content, hardware and browsers vary
[01:53:22] <bigbugjava> umm, can you place a small script to run at first, and fadein() only when .done ?
[01:55:39] <rivarun> bigbugjava: i don't think i can do that with $(function() { /* things happen here */ }).done(){ fadeIn() }); , can i?
[01:58:00] <bigbugjava> rivarun not 100% sure, but you can try, I have used setTimeout, but as you said, you cannot know the time because it's vary
[01:58:28] <bigbugjava> I would set high Timeout if I was running out of options
[02:00:07] <rivarun> bigbugjava: i don't want to end up annoying the users more than the loading time already does. oh well, it looks like i'm out of luck. might as well get back to actual work
[02:05:03] <bigbugjava> rivarun try again later on, people with more experince might be able to find something
[02:05:22] <rivarun> that's funny. it seems to slow chromium down but has no effect on firefox' speed. bigbugjava i will, thanks
[02:17:12] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to send a form with ajax, but I'm getting the ajax error function. Any suggestion please? http://jsfiddle.net/CVg82/
[02:50:14] <Fusl> abailarri: that doesn't work on jsfiddle as they block ajax requests because of csrf
[02:50:34] <abailarri> Fusl,  what?
[02:50:52] <Fusl> your jsfiddle doesn't work because jsfiddle's server blocks ajax requests
[02:51:00] <Fusl> any type of ajax requests
[02:51:14] <abailarri> a ok Fusl, but, is correct the script?
[02:51:27] <abailarri> in my localhost not works
[02:51:55] <Fusl> one second
[02:52:50] <abailarri> Fusl, the new code http://jsfiddle.net/CVg82/1/
[02:53:41] <Fusl> the code seems to be okay
[02:54:04] <abailarri> the new code?
[02:54:08] <Fusl> yep
[02:54:29] <Fusl> it gives you an error if the page you are trying to post this data to does not exist... does the file ../php/contact.php exist in your webspace?
[02:54:41] <abailarri> yes
[02:55:04] <Fusl> is it still giving you an error on your webspace?
[02:55:09] <abailarri> the code returns me the alert
[02:55:17] <abailarri> in the console I not see any error
[02:55:50] <Fusl> hmm
[02:55:53] <Fusl> weird
[02:57:34] <Fusl> try this: http://jsfiddle.net/CVg82/2/
[02:57:48] <Fusl> and see what error is it giving you back
[03:00:15] <abailarri> Fusl, error: [Exception... "Access to restricted URI denied"  code: "1012" nsresult: "0x805303f4 (NS_ERROR_DOM_BAD_URI)"  location: "<unknown>"]
[03:00:26] <abailarri> oo
[03:00:31] <abailarri> wait
[03:00:34] <Fusl> that was unexpected
[03:00:47] <abailarri> I'm not working in apache
[03:00:50] <abailarri> wait
[03:02:14] <abailarri> Fusl, yeah
[03:02:18] <Fusl> hm?
[03:02:20] <abailarri> in the server works
[03:02:25] <Fusl> okay
[03:21:39] <bigbugjava> Fusl hi dude
[03:21:46] <Fusl> hi bigbugjava
[03:22:00] <bigbugjava> Amazon s3 you ever used it ?
[03:22:03] <Fusl> nope
[03:22:17] <bigbugjava> bad bad bad
[03:22:17] <bigbugjava> lol
[03:22:19] <Fusl> :D
[03:22:32] <bigbugjava> no such channel here ha
[03:22:33] <bigbugjava> damn
[03:32:14] <Fusl> console.log($(msg).find('head').find('title').html()); -> "An empty string" in the console... am i doing something wrong?
[03:32:48] <trupheenix> anyone here tell me why do I get a jquery:8706 when I do an AJAX Cross Domain POST request?
[03:44:16] <trupheenix> does Jquery cross domain ajax work at all?
[03:45:45] <_rgn> you get a jquery:8706?
[03:46:13] <_rgn> is that supposed to be some kind of error
[03:47:14] <trupheenix> _rgn,  well.. there is no error message. In chrome's console, I get the url to which i'm performing the ajax followed by a jquery:8706
[03:47:22] <trupheenix> _rgn, so I'm clueless what this means
[03:56:23] <Kamuela> trupheenix: it needs to be jsonp
[03:57:19] <Kamuela> trupheenix: i have been warned against it because cross-domain is insecure, but you can use http://jsonp.jit.su/
[03:57:33] <Kamuela> trupheenix: that's a hack that will make regular json work
[03:57:47] <trupheenix> Kamuela, ok
[03:57:49] <Kamuela> keep in mind you are trusting that server at that point though
[03:57:59] <trupheenix> Kamuela, http://pastebin.ca/2517486
[03:58:08] <trupheenix> Kamuela, that is what i'm attempting to do
[03:58:36] <Kamuela> trupheenix: oh, i didn't even ask. are you getting json? or is this xml?
[03:58:54] <trupheenix> Kamuela, json
[03:59:13] <Kamuela> trupheenix: use $.getJSON() :D
[03:59:17] <trupheenix> Kamuela, thing is the request fails. I get an error on jquery.js at line number 8706
[03:59:27] <trupheenix> Kamuela, but I need to post the parameters
[03:59:48] <Kamuela> trupheenix: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[03:59:55] <trupheenix> Kamuela, ok
[04:00:23] <dwarder> why this http://jsfiddle.net/N4Arc/ gives me 5 and not 1 (tuesday) ?
[04:00:24] <dwarder> 24 is tuesday
[04:00:40] <Kamuela> trupheenix: basically it goes $.getJSON('//yoururl.com/request.json', function (data) { // data is your object });
[04:01:36] <trupheenix> Kamuela, ok
[04:01:49] <trupheenix> Kamuela, but how do I post my parameters?
[04:02:03] <trupheenix> Kamuela, I don't want to do a GET request
[04:05:34] <emx> i use jquery mobile. what is the reason that a click on the big picture on http://attika-shop.de/de/elektro-3-STEP-1-SEITIG places the top left corner of the popup to the middle of the viewport and only the second click on the big picture places the popup where it is expected? also: if you choose a different picture the first click on the big picture places the popup where the popup for the previous picture was. again, the second click places the popup where expec
[04:05:34] <emx> ted. any help?
[04:06:17] <trupheenix> Kamuela, getJson also gives error
[04:07:53] <Kamuela> trupheenix: one second, can you post that code into jsfiddle.net ?
[04:14:45] <trupheenix> Kamuela, I figured out why it was not working. Right now I need to enable CORS support
[04:15:17] <Kamuela> trupheenix: and how are you doing that?
[04:15:40] <trupheenix> Kamuela, finding out
[04:22:45] <Kamuela> trupheenix: have you looked at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4342926/how-can-i-send-json-data-to-server ?
[05:15:32] <bigbugjava> s3d_matt ?
[05:19:41] <fabioportieri> merry christmas bye bye
[05:29:45] <bigbugjava> anyone here knows how to list a folder that is within a bucket on amazon s3, using AWS-SDK, Javascript?
[05:38:15] <lyrae> So i know you can use .on() to target elements appended to the dom..but how do i simply select elements? for instance, i appended 5 <li>'s to an empty <ul>, and $('ul').find('li').length gives me 0
[05:57:58] <_rgn> lyrae: looks right. something else is wrong
[05:58:15] <bigbugjava> I have photos on amazon s3 bucket, I want to display them on my webpage using jquery slider, anyone here knows the correct steps to make it work
[06:01:46] <_rgn> bigbugjava: i don't know if you can query S3 with just javascript on the browser, you probably have to do that in the backend and send the list of files to the browser
[06:04:34] <_rgn> then you can either construct the S3 urls in the client-side js knowing the bucket name etc. or you can do that in the backend
[06:05:47] <bigbugjava> _rgn I know, I'm using my site to list and Prefix they key I need, I don't know how to get a object or array of urls with that photos, like : _rgn
[06:05:54] <bigbugjava> lol
[06:05:56] <bigbugjava> like :L https://webwedding.s3.amazonaws.com/dagan/googlemap.png
[06:10:06] <bigbugjava> _rgn I know, I'm using my site to list and Prefix they key I need, I don't know how to get a object or array of urls with that photos, like : https://webwedding.s3.amazonaws.com/dagan/googlemap.png
[06:10:10] <bigbugjava> if you are still here
[06:11:04] <_rgn> i'm not getting grasp of your problem
[06:13:36] <Velveeta> perhaps a jsfiddle example might help............
[06:16:15] <bigbugjava> http://jsfiddle.net/7WKFk/
[06:16:19] <bigbugjava> what I made :)
[06:16:22] <bigbugjava> thx for help!
[06:16:59] <bigbugjava> I should grap with Node.js and get it back to client side, get object with photos urls or something like that
[06:22:00] <Velveeta> so, i'm not sure what this question is doing on the jquery channel, but i can tell you 2 problems that i think i see, which are that you appear to be running an async call out to s3, and only storing part of your code in the callback, which means some of your code will execute when that async call completes, and the rest will execute immediatelyâ€¦ the other issue is that you're console.log'ing that data from the response instead of w
[06:22:02] <Velveeta> stream with res.send or something
[06:22:40] <_rgn> and you're using POST instead of GET
[06:23:22] <Fusl> Velveeta: in node.js it's res.write and res.end
[06:24:05] <Velveeta> fusl: well, yeah, it's been a while since i had to modify any of our node code, which only reinforces that this question doesn't exactly belong on the jquery channel :D
[06:24:10] <bigbugjava> I'm console.loging it so I can see what I'm sending, and I'm using POST because I need to send sitename to node.js to handle Prefix with Amazon S3, So I have to send it
[06:25:15] <Velveeta> bigbugjava: you may be logging it to see what you're sending, but you're still not writing it to your output stream afterwards, so you're not responding with anything
[06:27:04] <_rgn> i guess he doesn't know how to do that
[06:27:32] <bigbugjava> Velveeta Isn't better to check before you send? why should I send that data?
[06:28:20] <Velveeta> well, if you expect for your browser to get a response from the server, i would highly advise responding to it when it makes a request...
[06:30:39] <bigbugjava> thx
[06:31:58] <bigbugjava>  res.write(url); is what should be the res for req, but it dones't help cause url doens't show the correct path, thats is the issue
[06:35:11] <Velveeta> well, regardless, i don't think you're going to get the same level of help on this problem in the jquery channel as you would in say, the nodejs channel, or amazon s3 supportâ€¦
[06:38:39] <bigbugjava> there is amazon channel here?
[06:42:00] <naquad> i've got form submitting to iframe (<form target="..." ...>) which even will iframe evmit when result is loaded?
[06:44:24] <Velveeta> bigbugjava: i don't think there's an amazon channel here, no, but they should have a support option on their site somewhere
[06:44:57] <Velveeta> bigbugjava: and just like we try to support jquery and jquery plugins and widgets, i would imagine someone in the node channel could help w/ the s3 node module
[06:45:00] <dijitaltrix> can anyone help me with a simple issue..? I can't seem to access an ajax response
[06:45:23] <Velveeta> naquad: i think you're looking for the load event
[06:45:24] <dijitaltrix> I can see I've recieved a JSON object but I can reference response.status
[06:45:48] <Velveeta> dijitaltrix: are you setting your dataType to json?
[06:45:59] <dijitaltrix> my response returned daat looks like this: {"status":"warning", "data":"html data here }
[06:46:09] <dijitaltrix> Velveeta: yes I have set dataType to JSON
[06:46:18] <Velveeta> i think that might be your problem
[06:46:26] <dijitaltrix> Velveeta: I am passing the response to another function though
[06:46:51] <Velveeta> er actualy scrap that, i lied, how many params are you receiving in your callback?
[06:48:04] <dijitaltrix> Velveeta: Please take a look at the relevant code here: http://paste.laravel.com/1gYN
[06:48:46] <dijitaltrix> I have a plugin that handles a bootstrap modal which submits the form and calls the handler function
[06:49:15] <dijitaltrix> it's doing my head in..
[06:49:21] <Velveeta> is there a 'status' property in your json response itself? as in you're publishing that from the server
[06:49:51] <dijitaltrix> Velveeta: yes I am sending a json_encoded array of status, data and errors
[06:50:12] <dijitaltrix> Velveeta: the response is at the bottom of the link
[06:50:28] <dijitaltrix> it's doing my head in..
[06:50:56] <Velveeta> ah gotcha, didn't scroll down :D
[06:51:16] <dijitaltrix> Velveeta: np ;) when I log response.status I get undefined
[06:51:50] <dijitaltrix> but when I log response a few lines above I get the code in at the bottom of the the link
[06:52:07] <Velveeta> ok, so your handler function *is* actually being invoked, and receiving "response", it's just not containing what you expect?
[06:52:46] <dijitaltrix> Velveeta: I don't think it's json.. I think it's just a string..
[06:52:59] <Velveeta> can you add to that what it actually is receiving? is response itself coming through as undefined, or just response.status?
[06:53:21] <dijitaltrix> response is teh string at the bottom of the link, response.status is undefined
[06:53:59] <dijitaltrix> Velveeta: I am going to JSON.parse(msg); it
[06:55:17] <dijitaltrix> Velveeta: seems to have done the trick.. jQuery is not parsing my returned data as JSON.. even though I've specified it in teh dataType
[06:56:41] <dijitaltrix> Velveeta: turns out it's laravel double encoding it..
[06:56:46] <dijitaltrix> or me.. doh!
[07:06:11] <Velveeta> well, that was strange
[07:06:50] <Velveeta> dijitaltrix: did you get your code sorted out?
[07:07:41] <dijitaltrix> Velveeta: I did thanks.. now I just have an issue with the way Laravel handles sessions/errors..
[07:08:28] <dijitaltrix> it won't paint the response form data with the validation errors because Laravel deems that errors should only be seen oncve you've redirected the user..
[07:09:17] <Velveeta> sounds like that's something baked into it, but you should be able to manually repaint the form area in your success callback
[07:09:39] <Velveeta> that's one reason i'm not a fan of frameworks that try to control both the back and front end behavior
[07:09:48] <Velveeta> i like that separation of concerns
[08:05:47] <fossxplorer> Merry Xmas. Any activity here today?
[08:13:40] <Velveeta> fossxplorer: off and on

[09:03:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> i need some hlep with a quicik snippet
[09:04:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> i need to "toggle" reverse an array of strings on doubleclick
[09:04:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: mind helping me
[09:04:49] <Velveeta> sure
[09:04:54] <Velveeta> got a fiddle?
[09:05:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> let me mock one

[09:07:04] <dblosevn> as well as 'this'
[09:07:19] <lianzinho> dblosevn: yes, I got, my problem now is with css
[09:07:21] <lianzinho> http://jsfiddle.net/5HGm2/1/
[09:07:35] <dblosevn> I made it work with the swing easing
[09:07:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/4vrP2/
[09:07:43] <lianzinho> how to keep all the squares in position while this one grows out?
[09:08:35] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/4vrP2/1/
[09:08:45] <Velveeta> reverse() wasn't defined, you want to output arr
[09:08:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: wtf it works fine with strings it doesnt like object arrays
[09:09:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: that fiddle was a test case, i actually using an array of objects

[09:10:27] <hfp> Hey guys, I have a modal dialog and I would like to submit the form that is inside the modal dialog. However, when I do this, the page is refreshed and it goes to the result of the form parsing php page. I have read about preventDefault() but I don't know where to put it so that when the Submit button is clicked the rest of my jQuery magic happens without the page being refreshed. Could anyone point me in the right direction please?
[09:10:57] <Velveeta> hfp: it goes in your submit handler
[09:11:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: nvm, I have a sort function that was messing stuff up, droped the .reverse and the sort into an if and voila, thanks for your help
[09:11:14] <Velveeta> $('form').on('submit', function (e) { e.preventDefault(); //other stuff });
[09:11:30] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: no problemo
[09:16:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: one more thing I need from you
[09:16:38] * Velveeta rubs his hands together.
[09:16:42] <Velveeta> LET'S DO DIS
[09:16:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> hahahha
[09:16:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay so I need a menu
[09:16:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> that when I click a button it opens
[09:17:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then if I click anywhere else except the menu while the menu is open
[09:17:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> it closes
[09:17:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> I have seen it done
[09:17:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> something to do with adding click handler to document
[09:17:34] <Velveeta> right
[09:17:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> mind mocking somethign up
[09:17:46] <Velveeta> sure
[09:17:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> dont know how to do
[09:17:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> thanks :) can always count on you
[09:18:23] <dblosevn> I need a menu that when I click on an item food magically appears :-)
[09:18:48] <dblosevn> Oh cant forget about the beer button either lol
[09:20:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> dblosevn: you might want to look into what Velveeta is mocking up for me
[09:20:10] <hfp> Velveeta: Thanks. It doesn't work because I am using maskedinput and jQuery validation I'm guessing but I don't have time anymore so I'll be back tonight ot try and solve this thing
[09:30:11] <maxmoore14> anyone know if there is a public weinre server I can use?
[09:32:43] <jphase> maxmoore14: don't know of one off the top of my head, but it'd be pretty easy to spin one up
[09:32:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> maxmoore14: these are one of those questions that you leave out for someone to letmegooglethatforme attacks
[09:33:28] <maxmoore14> go ahead... haven't found one yet
[09:33:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: hahhaha you and your build from scratch ideology
[09:33:37] <maxmoore14> phonegap has one that I use normally
[09:33:40] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: here ya go: http://jsfiddle.net/E9Uab/
[09:33:46] <maxmoore14> seems to be down for the last hour
[09:33:50] <maxmoore14> looking for another
[09:33:53] <jphase> not much of a build from scratch when you just install it with npm
[09:34:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes true
[09:34:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: it works great once
[09:34:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> cant open menu after that
[09:34:54] <Velveeta> oh yeah, let me fix something
[09:35:00] <Uhkis> Rohan_Bhangui: use toggle instead of hide
[09:35:16] <Velveeta> there we go: http://jsfiddle.net/E9Uab/1/
[09:35:32] <Velveeta> forgot to unbind the click handler from the document
[09:35:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: yeah! :D that works thanks
[09:35:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> will fork that
[09:35:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> so i can reuse for later
[09:36:10] <Uhkis> http://jsfiddle.net/E9Uab/2/
[09:36:25] <Uhkis> and there's a version which can open the same menu more than once
[09:36:37] <Velveeta> uhkis: if you just change it to a toggle, then future clicks on the document cause the menu to show/hide also
[09:36:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> Uhkis: your solution works, but I have to click menu item twice
[09:36:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: you know what we are missing right about now
[09:37:04] <Uhkis> O_o
[09:37:04] <Velveeta> alcohol?
[09:37:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> nope.
[09:37:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[09:37:16] <Uhkis> works fine on firefox
[09:37:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> we are missing one of grafi 's gifs
[09:37:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> Uhkis: you have to click it and then close, and then click it again
[09:37:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> it doesnt open
[09:37:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> only after you click it one more time does it open
[09:38:10] <Velveeta> with uhkis, i can get it to click by just clicking on the document, like the expected behavior should be
[09:38:30] <Velveeta> however, i also get the unexpected behavior of future clicks on the document toggling the menu display, instead of clicks on the menu items only
[09:38:53] <Uhkis> Velveeta: ah
[09:39:45] <Uhkis> now i'm gonna do what Velveeta suggested. alcohol.
[09:39:51] <maxmoore14> is there any way to identify specifically Safari on an iPad?
[09:39:53] <Velveeta> i think that's always a win
[09:40:26] <Velveeta> maxmoore14: do you mean as opposed to safari on a desktop, or as opposed to some other browser on an ipad?
[09:40:33] <maxmoore14> both
[09:40:44] <Stephen> Hola
[09:40:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> hola
[09:40:56] <Velveeta> is there a reason? there may be some other workaround, depending on what you're trying to do
[09:41:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> Uhkis: lol
[09:41:10] <maxmoore14> there's a very annoying little bug to do with subdomains
[09:41:36] <maxmoore14> I have a jquery mobile app hosted at app.domain.com
[09:41:50] <maxmoore14> I also have my main marketing site at domain.com
[09:42:09] <maxmoore14> the index.html of app.domain.com is a login form
[09:43:07] <maxmoore14> when safari/ipad interrupts the login process and tries to store the user's password, it redirects me to domain.com - almost like it is doing a page refresh without the subdomain
[09:43:21] <maxmoore14> doesn't happen on safari desktop/iphone
[09:43:28] <maxmoore14> doesn't happen on chrome/ipad
[09:43:38] <Velveeta> interesting
[09:43:41] <maxmoore14> doesn't happen anywhere I have seen other than safari/ipad
[09:43:53] <Velveeta> how about safari/iphone?
[09:43:56] <maxmoore14> I can fix it by adding autocomplete=off for the password field
[09:44:01] <Velveeta> like is it ios-specific or ipad-specific?
[09:44:01] <Uhkis> well browser detection is not that hard
[09:44:05] <maxmoore14> safari/iphone works perfectly
[09:44:27] <maxmoore14> very odd to me that it is just safari/ipad
[09:44:34] <Velveeta> right
[09:44:46] <maxmoore14> I'd like to avoid annoying users with autocomplete=off unless I have to
[09:44:52] <Uhkis> http://davidwalsh.name/detect-ipad
[09:44:55] <maxmoore14> so I want to target minimally
[09:47:31] <Uhkis> btw maxmoore14 thanks for giving me yet another reason to hate mobile subdomains :D
[09:47:44] <maxmoore14> no problem!
[09:48:48] <maxmoore14> the thing is, it isn't a mobile subdomain - I'm using domain.com as my "marketing" site - app.domain.com as my responsive web app
[09:51:05] <jphase> hmm, weinre is a super cake install. npm ftw!
[09:51:28] <Velveeta> also, it has a great name

[10:00:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> *teller
[10:00:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: dibs on official letmegooglethat troller
[10:00:40] <Velveeta> go for it
[10:01:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> its fun to take over #jquery with our absolutely useless and unrelated discussions
[10:01:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[10:01:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> loving it
[10:02:05] <Velveeta> so, i'm faced with a moral dilemma here
[10:02:19] <Velveeta> i have a delicious breckenridge vanilla porter sitting here next to me...
[10:02:28] <jphase> MM
[10:02:31] <Velveeta> the problem is that i poured it last night...
[10:02:38] <jphase> well, you have to drink!
[10:02:40] <Velveeta> but i put a plate on top of it when i went to bed
[10:02:45] <Velveeta> to try to minimize it going flat
[10:02:57] <Velveeta> so now it's just warm, which isn't a terrible thing for a porter
[10:03:03] <Velveeta> i'm just wondering if i should go for it
[10:03:18] <Velveeta> i have the wife fetching me a cold one right now, so technically, i need to empty this glass to pour the new one
[10:03:20] <jphase> what I normally do is pop 3 cubes of ice in a glass in that situation
[10:03:41] <Velveeta> i'll give it a test sip
[10:04:07] <jphase> as long as you don't tip it back all college dorm-room style then it should stay cold through the thin layer of ice
[10:04:10] <Velveeta> ok, it's mostly flat
[10:04:13] <jphase> doh
[10:04:25] <Velveeta> â€¦â€¦â€¦..but that didn't stop me from taking half of it in the first pull
[10:04:30] <jphase> lol
[10:04:34] <Velveeta> because i'm a man
[10:04:40] <Velveeta> and a man can muscle through this
[10:04:46] <jphase> I wonder if those make it yourself soda machines would fix a flat beer....
[10:04:55] <jphase> o_O
[10:04:59] <Velveeta> i believe they would
[10:05:06] <Velveeta> we're actually thinking about investing in one of those
[10:05:07] * jphase amends xmas list
[10:05:23] <Velveeta> because we have a cruise scheduled for later in the year, and it's a way to sneak booze on board
[10:05:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> lolz
[10:05:59] <Velveeta> so i'm thinking, $10 per drink, or free bottle of vodka to make many drinks?
[10:06:05] * Velveeta weighs the air between both hands.
[10:06:39] <Fusl> guys... youtube and mixcloud use these fancy progressbar for ajax get requests... is there a way i can do this with jquery's ajax too?
[10:07:32] <Velveeta> fusi: so, there are a couple of ways to do it...
[10:07:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> Fusl: yes it is posssible
[10:07:44] <Fusl> how?
[10:07:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol Velveeta i also mistook the 'l' for 'i'
[10:08:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: you got this
[10:08:25] <Velveeta> 1 is you can use xhr2 support where it's available, another is to estimate and display progress events on a timed interval, and the other is to create a server side endpoint to report back what the progress is, and issue polled requests to it to keep tabs on the upload progress
[10:08:46] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: i'm by no means the expert on all things, so if you have valuable info, feel free to throw it out there in addition to my own :)
[10:09:19] <Velveeta> fusl: xhr2 is the best way, but isn't supported in all browsers, so it depends on what your support matrix looks like
[10:09:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: true, but I am much less exp. than you and plus most of the time your responses are dead on
[10:09:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> ^^my point proven
[10:09:55] <Velveeta> fusl: http://caniuse.com/xhr2
[10:09:57] <Fusl> Velveeta: if at least one browser supports it, it should be implemented on my website :D
[10:10:31] <Velveeta> if you don't need IE < 10, you should be safe to use xhr2 pretty exclusively, and it works for progress events like this: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/xhr2/
[10:10:47] <Velveeta> you can just tie an event listener to that onprogress event, and update your progress bar from its info
[10:14:14] <Velveeta> if you do need legacy browser support, and you need it to be reliable as opposed to estimated, you'd need to set up something on the server to check the file size on disk against the total expected file size, and return a percentage based on that
[10:14:38] <Velveeta> and then you'd issue a parallel request every second or so, during the upload, to that other endpoint, and update your progress bar based on that response
[10:14:53] <Fusl> Velveeta: it's for simple html pages
[10:15:04] <Fusl> not downloads or anything larger than a few KB's
[10:15:50] <Velveeta> well if it's only a few kb of file size, you probably don't even need a progress bar, ..these days, those kinds of transfers are over in the blink of an eye
[10:17:36] <Fusl> but why do youtube and mixcloud then use progressbars for simple get requests on html pages which are also a few kb's large
[10:17:38] <Fusl> ?
[10:17:52] * Rohan_Bhangui loves html5rocks
[10:18:21] <Velveeta> fusl: define "few"
[10:18:28] <Velveeta> are you talking like 5k? or like 100k?
[10:18:29] <Fusl> < 1MB
[10:18:41] <Velveeta> ok, that's still enough time to warrant a progress bar
[10:18:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> Fusl: here is a post abut the youtube thing, you miht get some ideas
[10:18:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> https://coderwall.com/p/3zuy5w
[10:18:55] <Velveeta> i meant *literally* a "few" k is negligable, few being like 3-5
[10:19:10] <Fusl> lol
[10:19:14] <Fusl> Rohan_Bhangui: thank you <3 :D
[10:19:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> np
[10:19:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> its just the css and stuff
[10:19:41] <Velveeta> rohan_bhangui: see? never be afraid to throw out an answer just because someone else is responding, if you feel like you have additional info to provide ;)
[10:19:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[10:20:12] <Velveeta> BOOM, finished that porter.. now for a code, carbonated one
[10:20:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i guess letmegooglethat did come in handy :P
[10:20:26] * Rohan_Bhangui smh
[10:20:39] <Fusl> lmgtfy and giyf are blocked here
[10:20:41] <Fusl> :D
[10:20:42] <jphase> Velveeta you gangsta!
[10:20:51] <Velveeta> i KILLED it!
[10:20:56] <Velveeta> blao blao!
[10:20:59] <jphase> heh
[10:21:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:23:42] <jphase> hey Rohan_Bhangui I made my first client logo the other day that they actually fell in love with, you'd be proud :D
[10:24:53] <Velveeta> jphase: was it one of these 2? http://i.imgur.com/aS1724P.jpg
[10:24:59] <jphase> haha, I love those!
[10:25:05] <Velveeta> :D
[10:25:17] <jphase> seen those b4, and the one with the priest and the kid... omg
[10:25:22] <Velveeta> heheheh
[10:25:42] <Velveeta> how about OGC?
[10:26:05] <jphase> alright, now you have me drinking beer at 1:25pm, pow'r in numbaz
[10:26:14] <Velveeta> http://i.imgur.com/KanYStP.png
[10:26:30] <Velveeta> you made it pretty far, i'm an hour behind you :D
[10:26:34] <jphase> hahah, oh that's a new one for me
[10:26:39] <Velveeta> when i said "ok, beer time" it was like 12:01 :D
[10:27:34] <jphase> yeah, we'd get along well in person.
[10:27:56] * jphase is a high functioning alcoholic
[10:28:14] <Velveeta> i like to think of myself as a low-functioning sober
[10:28:19] <jphase> hah
[10:28:29] <jphase> I'm stealing that
[10:28:32] <Velveeta> heheheh
[10:28:45] <Velveeta> there's definitely something to the ballmer peak theory
[10:28:54] <Velveeta> as long as you don't overdue it
[10:29:13] <Velveeta> because that chart looks like gradual-climb-gradual-climb-gradual-climb-steep-dropoff
[10:30:08] <jphase> I'm not familiar
[10:30:23] <jphase> where's my lmgtfy.com addict when I need him :\
[10:30:34] <Velveeta> http://xkcd.com/323/
[10:31:02] <jphase> ahh haha of course xkcd
[10:32:10] <Cryp71c> I have a collection of (a few thousand) objects that I want to .each through and make DOM changes to them (their top and left positioning). I have it working but it is SLOW. Is there an alternative to this: http://paste2.org/UcI3de1O
[10:33:18] <Velveeta> cryp71c: i don't know how much you'll be able to improve performance on manipulating top/left values on thousands of nodes in a fairly immediate window of time, however, you can try looking into requestAnimationFrame to try to limit it in batches
[10:33:22] <jphase> hmm, not sure if that code is the slow part there Cryp71c, what type of objects are these .star_map_planet
[10:33:28] <jphase> oh, *foot-in-mouth*
[10:33:57] <Velveeta> because each of those top/left assignments are going to cause a repaint, and you're doing it twice per loop by writing those values separately
[10:35:14] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, I'm reading up on some other performance stuff, would a for loop be better, or using the container of #('.star_map_planet') to select all of those objects rather than using the class also help performance?
[10:36:46] <Velveeta> so, using the global class selector will cause a slight slowdown at the start, but that's it.. you can try to limit it to the scope of a container instead of the full document, but once that collection has been parsed, that's the end of that optimizationâ€¦ you *can* speed it up slightly by changing the kind of loop, there are jsperf tests out there already for jquery's .each() loop vs _.each, or a for loop, or whatever
[10:37:02] <Velveeta> but i think the main part of your slowdown is going to be all of the repainting you're causing on the browser
[10:37:53] <Velveeta> you can try to limit *that* by combining those 2 .css() calls into 1, because writing each of those values separately can cause 2 paint events in the browser vs 1, so instead of .css('top', sdf).css('left', sdf), do .css({top: sdf, left: sdf})
[10:38:39] <Velveeta> and then you can also try setting up a timer to see approximately how many of those you can get done in the span of 16ms, and break them up into batches to run in separate animation frames
[10:39:04] <Velveeta> that should make the browser stay snappy in response to user events, and spread the load out over the course of a second or so
[10:39:51] <Velveeta> when you run a loop like that, you're killing the browser's ability to respond to user events, so it makes the experience feel more sluggish, and sometimes even cause the browser to freeze up entirely until it's done with that task
[10:40:17] <Velveeta> if you use even a setTimeout of 1ms between iterations of a loop, it gives the browser a chance to catch its breath and respond to external events in between iterations
[10:40:33] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, previous to this attempt I had the page re-drawing the collection server side, which was faster than what I've got now...do you think - even with all the optimizations you've suggested - that it would ever out-perform the server-side call?
[10:41:10] <Velveeta> so, it would recalc everything server side and then do what, a page refresh, or send back consumable html to reinject into the page after an ajax request?
[10:42:37] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, ajax call to a method whose only purpose is to draw the "map" by blowing away the previous content and repopulating.
[10:43:39] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, you can see it for yourself: openbattletech.com
[10:43:43] <Velveeta> so, something like that can work for smaller numbers of clients, but it isn't a scalable solution, because as more clients use this service, your server will get choked up on that job of generating new positions and content, which you could easily outsource to the client to handle insteadâ€¦ i think you'll want to try a combination of factors, i can write up a sample method of optimization
[10:43:52] <Cryp71c> i zooms in, k zooms out
[10:43:54] <Velveeta> ohhhhhhh battletech, i'm already excited
[10:44:23] <Cryp71c> Its quite slow, the server its running on is limited in its specs.
[10:44:46] <Velveeta> ok, let me write up some sample optimizations for you and see what it can help with
[10:45:07] <Cryp71c> Thanks. I really appreciate it
[10:45:25] <Velveeta> first of all, that star map, does it get elements added or removed dynamically?
[10:45:39] <Velveeta> or is it however many nodes are there at load time and that's it, that count never changes?
[10:46:43] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, all the elements are on the page, but changing the timeline causes a redraw; planet ownership changes, and zooming also redraws.
[10:46:54] <Cryp71c> But the actual divs are (all) on the page from the start.
[10:47:06] <Velveeta> ok, and the divs themselves don't go away due to a redraw?
[10:47:30] <Velveeta> so like $('.star_map_planet') at load time is the same as $('.star_map_planet') after a zoom in or out?
[10:48:09] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, no, the div background_content is assigned content on timeline change and zooming.
[10:48:17] <Velveeta> ok gotcha
[10:48:43] <Cryp71c> It could work without server side calls, clearly. But I'm concerned about the amount of data and responsiveness.
[10:49:08] <Velveeta> right, well let me see what i can do
[10:49:18] <Velveeta> is this something you can just drop in and test the effects of fairly immediately?
[10:50:09] <Cryp71c> Yep
[10:50:26] <Cryp71c> I've got everything setup locally for testing prior to pushing anything up
[10:50:34] <Velveeta> cool
[10:51:45] <BillCriswell> Velveeta: You ever use flex?
[10:51:52] <Velveeta> billcriswell: hell no
[10:51:59] <Velveeta> :D
[10:52:05] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[10:52:11] <Velveeta> i can't wait for flash technologies to die once and for all
[10:52:20] <BillCriswell> Flexbox
[10:54:44] <jphase> flexbox is a bit different heh, but I generally just use a CSS framework for grid stuff personally
[10:55:20] <BillCriswell> I'm looking into learning it just to kind of keep up. It feels so weird.
[10:56:16] <jphase> I have yet to use it on my display property :\
[10:56:21] <jphase> seems handy though
[10:56:54] <jphase> the pack stuff they have is neat
[10:58:53] <Velveeta> cryp71c: ok, here's a first-round optimization: http://pastebin.com/bdshF7Jc
[10:58:59] <BillCriswell> jphase: These prefixes give me anxiety haha
[10:59:11] <Velveeta> i moved the window width/height and map width/height calculations out of the loop, and combined the css calls into 1
[10:59:38] <Velveeta> it may throw a syntax error somewhere or something, i didn't test this, so it's possible i missed a semicolon or + or something
[10:59:50] <jphase> BillCriswell: indeed, I wonder if any frameworks are using these :\
[11:00:23] <Velveeta> billcriswell: ohhhhhhh flexBOX, well that's different! :D
[11:00:40] <Velveeta> but no, i don't use flexbox yet, i'm just not opposed to the technology :)
[11:01:38] <Velveeta> any of you that use grunt as part of your build/deploy process may like this for css prefixes: https://npmjs.org/package/grunt-autoprefixer
[11:02:10] <Velveeta> lets you work in just w3c approved css names, and it determines which ones need to be prefixed for browsers that aren't fully up to spec, and prefixes those for you
[11:02:20] <jphase> ooo, thanks Velveeta
[11:02:32] <Velveeta> i haven't used that yet either, but just came across it a week or 2 ago
[11:02:55] <jphase> I forgot you're a node nerd, Velveeta++
[11:02:56] <Velveeta> it would be nice if it also did autotransformations for you on browser implementations that were out of sync with parameter order
[11:03:01] <Velveeta> :D
[11:03:13] <Velveeta> i'm not nearly as much of a node nerd as i'd like to be, but i'm currently educating myself in that
[11:03:22] <BillCriswell> I wonder if CodeKit will get that.
[11:04:30] <BillCriswell> I guess I could ask the dude.
[11:04:38] <Velveeta> lebowski?
[11:04:47] <Velveeta> tell him i want my money
[11:04:51] <BillCriswell> Haha. I could ask him too.
[11:05:16] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, that is an amazing start. Its nearly as responsive as the server-side implementation.
[11:05:24] <Velveeta> nice!

[11:06:07] <Velveeta> but we have to go deeper
[11:06:21] <jphase> I've been working on a sails.js project that scrapes content from sites with cheerio and does my bidding based on the results. Redis ftw
[11:06:53] <Velveeta> i can't wait for ibm's watson to get its public API next year
[11:06:55] <Cryp71c> I can't believe this...I really need to bone up on my jquery optimization knowledge.
[11:07:06] <Velveeta> i'm thinking i might actually try another get rich quick scheme using it
[11:07:26] <Velveeta> cryp71c: that wasn't even jquery optimization, that was just straight up js optimizing ;)
[11:07:52] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, well yeah...I'm terrible, thanks :)
[11:07:55] <Velveeta> so now are you ready to see the next level? :)
[11:07:59] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, here is the source for the star_map.js: http://paste2.org/7Vtf6e92
[11:08:07] <Cryp71c> The code I plopped in from you starts on 68.
[11:08:18] <Velveeta> gotcha
[11:08:33] <Cryp71c> And, most definitely yes.
[11:08:35] <Velveeta> let's see about splitting it up with animation frames real quick
[11:08:59] <Velveeta> first i'll start with a non-polyfilled version, and then polyfill for older browsers, but first we'll just see if it makes a difference at all
[11:11:23] <naquad> is here some big fat in-depth guide on promises?
[11:11:37] <Velveeta> there are a few good articles on them out there
[11:11:55] <naquad> Velveeta, it looks like with my luck i didn't google out any
[11:11:55] <Velveeta> i have one i wrote for our company's internal tech blog that i've been meaning to pull and repost publicly on my own blog
[11:12:46] <Velveeta> naquad: here's one on html5rocks.com: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/async/deferred/
[11:13:02] <naquad> Velveeta, thanks! went readingh
[11:13:20] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, is js/jquery development work all you do, or just a piece?
[11:13:26] <javalover> sooo idk where to ask this
[11:13:33] <Velveeta> cryp71c: it's about 90% of what i do
[11:13:39] <javalover> I want to make a backlink that displays proper content
[11:13:50] <javalover> so like www.mysite.com/jdkeir  would display a profile...
[11:14:19] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, I'm trying to guage how terrible I should feel at feeling like a complete novice atm.
[11:14:27] <javalover> oh i know like a youtube link
[11:14:43] <Velveeta> cryp71c: oh, dude, don't sweat this :D i'm a senior architect at our company, i've put in many years to get to this level :D
[11:15:06] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, "architect" you do mostly planning / team management, or still quite a bit of dev?
[11:15:34] <tw2113> everything takes time to become a pro at
[11:15:37] <Velveeta> quite a bit of dev, plus mentoring of my minions to bring them up technically, plus planning, no people management, i have no interest in that
[11:15:53] <tw2113> don't forget intern heckling Velveeta
[11:16:10] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, your minions also js/jquery specialists or general developers?
[11:16:11] <Velveeta> well, we haven't gotten any interns yet, but what a great idea
[11:16:52] <tw2113> maybe in 2013
[11:16:54] <tw2113> er 2014
[11:16:56] <Velveeta> they're also js specialists, we have dedicated front end engineers where i work, but we also run a continuing education series internally for our back end devs, sql people, etc, anybody that's interested in learning front end dev
[11:17:32] <javalover> guys, what is best way to convert backlink into variables?
[11:17:41] <javalover> oh wait does youtube look up the video based on id?
[11:17:56] <tw2113> i would imagine so
[11:18:14] <javalover> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eRfteo93UI&list=RDFdg5uOozY70
[11:18:18] <javalover> so something like this for example...
[11:18:24] <javalover> or to be simple http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eRfteo93UI
[11:18:40] <javalover> they then take the v & convert to id? or is that the actual id in a database?
[11:18:40] <tw2113> ID: 0eRfteo93UI
[11:18:57] <javalover> hmmmm
[11:18:59] <tw2113> none of us work for google, so we can't be certain
[11:19:05] <javalover> i know just looking for thoughts
[11:19:07] <javalover> on how to do this
[11:19:07] <tw2113> but that's the unique attribute that fetches the video
[11:19:22] <javalover> makes sense, ok so that's what i'll do then
[11:19:51] <javalover> the thing is, my id's are like 0-300
[11:20:01] <javalover> but i'd prefer to have a unique id that is more like the one above
[11:20:20] <javalover> maybe I should ask in sql ...
[11:20:31] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, as far as your knowledge is concerned, you developed it over time or did you pursue some specific education / self-education from specific resources?
[11:21:19] <Velveeta> cryp71c: i developed it over time, but the place i work at now has a heavy emphasis on education and knowledge sharing, so i was already pretty strong when i came on board here, but my knowledge has just spiked since then
[11:22:47] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, thanks for all your info. I'm in a very small software dev company (4 devs, 1 designer and 3 sql devs) where everyone has an entire hat-rack full of hats. I happen to be the senior man on the totem pole, so your insight is really interesting.
[11:23:30] <Velveeta> cryp71c: no problem :) i started out a full-stack dev myself, but about 3-4 years ago, started really specializing on the front end stuff
[11:24:14] <Velveeta> as a result, a lot of my back end knowledge has kind of rotted, but fortunately, languages are generally semantic and syntax rules that can be easily picked back up when neededâ€¦ it's the underlying patterns that make all the difference in coding
[11:25:57] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, yeah...I'm having a hard time finding the time to educate our development group on half the stuff I know. I guess its generally attributable to a lack of specialized staff. No true DBAs, no server manager, no IT dept, etc.
[11:27:18] <Velveeta> yeah, it can definitely be information overload trying to specialize in something when nobody else isâ€¦ when everybody knows everything, specialization can be lost in the white noise of all of the available info at all levels of the development stack
[11:28:10] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, so you're a fan of Battletech?
[11:28:17] <Velveeta> i used to be, long ago :)
[11:31:04] <Cryp71c> hehe, I'll try my hand at the animation frames thing and see how that helps out.
[11:33:41] <Cryp71c> Thanksa ton for all your help!
[11:33:44] <Velveeta> cryp71c: still there?
[11:33:49] <Velveeta> here's your next example: http://pastebin.com/UsYs1CUF
[11:33:53] <Velveeta> utilizing animation frames
[11:34:14] <Velveeta> just took me a few minutes to decide how to write it :)
[11:34:22] <Velveeta> again, there may be syntax errors, it's untested
[11:34:40] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, ah, yeah...sorry I didn't want to presume you had the time to mess with it.
[11:35:02] <Velveeta> right now the wife is watching cooking shows, and i've earmarked christmas break for learning more stuff ;)
[11:35:25] <Velveeta> and i try to spend time in here as often as possible knowledge dumping
[11:35:28] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, my girls are sleeping and I've earmarked this hour and a half (which is about to end) to not going apeshit.
[11:35:40] <Cryp71c> :)
[11:35:47] <Velveeta> i'd wager it's easier to not go apeshit when the girls are sleeping
[11:36:22] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, if you were me, would you put this into its own file, given its specialization and length?
[11:37:38] <Cryp71c> Eh, nvm..that's probably a bit loaded. Let me get the code itself a try
[11:38:06] <Velveeta> i would start out with it just here where it's at, and then once everything is working, figure out where to break it out
[11:43:36] <Cryp71c> I had messed up earlier, the first snippet that you gave me I never correctly implemented it. The code I tested was still using the server-side -_-
[11:43:46] <Velveeta> lol
[11:43:56] <Velveeta> no wonder it was operating on par w/ the server-side ;)
[11:44:09] <Cryp71c> the first snippet errors with "does not have a .data functioN" and the current snipping is hanging somewhere in the do while loop
[11:44:55] <Velveeta> gotcha, well let's go back to the first example first thenâ€¦ change the planet assignment from starMapPlanet[i] to $(starMapPlanet[i])
[11:50:19] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, Its INCREDIBLY fast
[11:50:33] <Velveeta> what whaaaaaat! <raising ze roof>
[11:50:45] <Cryp71c> maybe 200 ms? The server-side implementation was 1s - 1.5s
[11:51:05] <Velveeta> nice
[11:51:18] <Velveeta> now, here's one more question for you
[11:51:45] <Velveeta> all of those elements that are being referenced in your star map, do they actually need to exist? as in, can users interact with them?
[11:52:50] <Velveeta> because if they're strictly for show, and don't need to physically exist in the document for event bindings and interactions, you could consider swapping out this implementation for a canvas instead
[11:53:16] <Velveeta> a canvas is just a big pixel map, so you'd hold all of the star map data in memory in an array or something, and let the GPU position those pixels on screen, which it's amazingly fast at doing
[11:53:42] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, they can be clicked on and whatnot (to bring up planet details and whatnot)
[11:53:42] <Velveeta> transforms, scaling, rotating, etc, are operations that are pretty lightning fast via the gpu w/ a canvas
[11:53:53] <Velveeta> ok, in that case, you do need the actual elements
[11:56:42] <bigbugjava> Velveeta got a minute?
[12:04:45] <Velveeta> bigbugjava: yepyep
[12:09:13] <Velveeta> cryp71c: oh yeah, there were still issues in the 2nd round optimization to resolve huh :)
[12:10:32] <Velveeta> oh yeah, i see the issue in the 2nd code snippetâ€¦ change that while condition to this: while (frames[frame++].end < starMapPlanet.length)
[12:11:12] <Velveeta> and whoops, inside the processPlanetQueue function, that should be a .shift() operation, not .unshift()
[12:24:36] <Cryp71c> cannot read property of null
[12:25:56] <Velveeta> on which line, do you know?
[12:29:17] <bigbugjava> any recommened Image slider for wedding photos?
[12:30:13] <Velveeta> not from me.. i don't use image sliders, but i don't do a lot of work that deals with images either
[12:30:35] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, the assignment of top into planet.css
[12:30:44] <obert> bigbugjava:  jquery cycle
[12:32:52] <Velveeta> cryp71c: so that sounds like the context isn't coming through properly for some reason
[12:33:05] <Velveeta> is that in the live code on that page now such that i can take a debugger to it?
[12:34:07] <bigbugjava> obert link me
[12:34:15] <bigbugjava> :)
[12:34:45] <Velveeta> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+cycle
[12:37:34] <bigbugjava> saw that, not sure it will fit perfect
[12:43:18] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, give me a sec
[12:43:25] <Velveeta> no problem
[12:49:12] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, there you go, openbattletech.com
[12:49:22] <Cryp71c> Its also pretty freaky :)
[12:49:28] <Velveeta> looking now
[12:49:55] <Velveeta> ha!
[12:50:04] <Velveeta> yeah, that would be it splitting itself up over animation frames
[12:50:32] <Velveeta> now, i artificially dissected that thing into 60 frames for the full render
[12:50:43] <Velveeta> it's possible that it could be sped up just fine
[12:51:15] <Velveeta> try dropping the planetsPerFrame value from being divided by 60 to being divided by like 10
[12:52:25] <Cryp71c> Yeah its less freaky
[12:52:46] <Cryp71c> Its wierd to see everything but the centerpoint (terra) moving around.
[12:53:14] <Velveeta> heheheh
[12:53:24] <Velveeta> well, you can try dropping it down to like 2 from there
[12:53:32] <Velveeta> and it should be *fairly* instantaneous
[12:56:42] <Velveeta> one other bug i see that needs to be fixed, the Math.min line that sets it to the min of that frame worth of elements, or the length of the jquery collection, should set it to the min of that frame worth of elements, or the length of that collection minus 1
[12:57:16] <Velveeta> Math.min(((frame + 1) * planetsPerFrame) - 1, starMapPlanet.length)
[12:58:33] <Velveeta> er, that should be: Math.min(((frame + 1) * planetsPerFrame) - 1, starMapPlanet.length - 1)
[13:17:14] <bigbugjava> I need an image slider, that accept the fact that I'm getting the links dynamicly, and it will change from "view" site to another, anyone has one in the beg?
[13:20:07] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, still errors, I put in if (data == null) console.log(planet); and I get (just before the error): [jquery: "2.0.3", constructor: function, init: function, selector: "", toArray: functionâ€¦]
[13:20:08] <Cryp71c>  
[13:20:09] <jphase> bigbugjava: nivo is typically my go to slider for things that require good options and customizations
[13:20:43] <Velveeta> cryp71c: is the latest code live for me to look at?
[13:22:35] <bigbugjava> jphase it can handle object with amazon s3 links?
[13:22:41] <bigbugjava> and display these?
[13:23:10] <Velveeta> plugins don't care what an img's src is, so long as the browser can render it
[13:23:23] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, its up now and set to 2 frames.
[13:23:32] <Velveeta> ok, looking now
[13:23:54] <Velveeta> well that's hellaciously responsive now
[13:24:27] <Velveeta> you still need to fix that .length check in the Math.min, that should clear up the last of those js errors
[13:24:34] <Velveeta> line 96
[13:24:47] <Velveeta> at the end, change that starMapPlanets.length to starMapPlanets.length - 1
[13:25:11] <jphase> bigbugjava: yeah -> what Velveeta said
[13:25:34] <Velveeta> and then try to drop the divisor to 1 vs 2 (so you can just remove the division operation altogether)
[13:26:08] <Velveeta> it may be enough that we're putting it all into an animation frame period
[13:27:19] <bigbugjava> jphase wasn't reading what he said, okay thx
[13:27:25] <bigbugjava> Velveeta cheers again
[13:27:26] <bigbugjava> ;)
[13:27:30] <Velveeta> :)
[13:28:03] <Velveeta> wowâ€¦ i was laying here in bed w/ the wife, playing 2 live crew's "pop that coochie", and it put the wife to sleep
[13:28:26] <bigbugjava> hgehehehe
[13:28:36] <jphase> LOL
[13:28:45] <bigbugjava> going to my girlfriend now, was 2 much time on that, see you in 2 days
[13:28:47] <bigbugjava> bye good peeps
[13:28:53] <Velveeta> adios
[13:29:44] <jphase> ciao
[13:30:55] <Velveeta> cryp71c: i can't get over how much more incredibly fast that page is from where we started.. it's nearly realtime responsive now
[13:31:29] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, yeah, thatnks a ton for your help; its helped out with indicating to me the importance of js optimization. I'm heading out of the house. I'm going to PM you real quick.
[13:31:43] <Velveeta> no problem, have fun :)
[13:34:37] <sunbeam> Can I just set a cookie with jQuery?
[13:34:54] <jphase> sunbeam: there's a plugin to set cookies with jQuery
[13:35:30] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, when I put in the -1 it doesn't do anything, oddly enough.
[13:35:42] <Velveeta> is that published live?
[13:37:28] <ericandrewlewis> most of the "sticky" element jquery libraries i look at glitch a bit on "stickying"
[13:37:38] <ericandrewlewis> even the one on the facebook right sidebar is a bit glitchy.
[13:37:52] <ericandrewlewis> (takes a second to stick, so it scrolls up and then sticks down to where it is supposed to)
[13:38:46] <jphase> ericandrewlewis: I usually just write a quick 3-4 liner for that to work out all the kinks rather than use a library.
[13:39:15] <jphase> but yeah, it can be glitchy based on how it's written and how fast you're scrolling
[13:39:25] <Velveeta> and how fast the browser is at reacting
[13:39:37] <jphase> >= and <= are your friend in stuff like that
[13:40:06] <sunbeam> jphase: can this be done without plugin?
[13:40:23] <jphase> sunbeam: yeah, you can write your own cookie handler
[13:40:48] <jphase> sunbeam: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/document.cookie
[13:40:53] <ericandrewlewis> it seems like such a simple thing for a library to not nail
[13:41:09] <ericandrewlewis> but, i'm using a full "animation" library with skrollr right now
[13:41:19] <ericandrewlewis> so i'm sure there's overhead for the ton of use cases they support.
[13:41:26] <jphase> ericandrewlewis: well the library is probably working, but as Velveeta said sometimes things like the speed of the JS engine have slower reaction times, etc. etc.
[13:41:35] <ericandrewlewis> word
[13:43:56] <sunbeam> jphase: so you would recommend just using the jquery cookie plugin
[13:44:04] <jphase> sunbeam: actually no, lol
[13:44:43] <jphase> the reader/writer example on MDN is all you'll need, and the developer who wrote that jquery.cookie.js plugin uses 8 space soft tabs so they're a noob in my book :x
[13:46:11] <jphase> I think they also use $.browser in their plugin too, which is deprecated
[13:50:18] <Velveeta> do you need to set a cookie that the server can read?
[13:50:43] <Velveeta> because if not, you can use a library that prioritizes storage in something like localstorage or indexeddb where it's supported, and falls back to cookies where it's not
[13:51:16] <jphase> mmm... localstorage
[13:51:20] <jphase> :]
[13:52:05] <ericandrewlewis> jphase: works much better rolling your own :)
[13:52:22] <jphase> w00t
[13:53:41] <jphase> I'm all about not reinventing the wheel, but with stuff like that I don't trust all the extra overhead that ensues with most plugins
[13:54:35] <ericandrewlewis> so, now i have sticky working. any suggestions for unsticking at a spot in the page, and the element rejoins regular scrolling after that?
[13:54:56] <ericandrewlewis> would i absolutely position the element at the last position i want it to stay at?
[13:55:35] <Velveeta> sounds about right to me
[13:56:05] <ericandrewlewis> what if that element was previously in a relatively positioned element? should i purposefully not put it under any other relative positioned elements other than body?
[13:56:42] <ericandrewlewis> (because absolutely positioning elements under a relative positioned element yada yada yadaâ€¦)
[13:56:47] <Velveeta> so it starts off positive within a relative parent, then switches to sticky, then switches to absolute on the page?
[13:57:15] <Velveeta> in that case, then yeah, you'd have to detach it from its own parent and just append it to the body or something
[13:57:22] <tw2113> LEWIS
[13:57:28] <ericandrewlewis> lol
[13:57:32] <ericandrewlewis> hey tw2113
[13:57:50] <ericandrewlewis> Velveeta: yeah, detaching sounds like a good solution there.
[13:57:59] <ericandrewlewis> maybe detach at the fixed position point?
[13:58:07] <tw2113> yo
[13:58:26] <Velveeta> yeah, at the time it switched to fixed/sticky, i'd probably go ahead and just append it to the body
[13:58:49] <ericandrewlewis> is this gonna look terrible on touch?
[13:58:56] <ericandrewlewis> slash not work
[13:58:59] <Velveeta> it's entirely possible
[13:59:10] <Velveeta> but that's where you can use sticky instead of fixed
[13:59:19] <Velveeta> mobile safari doesn't work well with fixed positioning
[13:59:29] <Velveeta> but on ios6+, should work fine with position sticky
[14:00:06] <ericandrewlewis> are sticky and fixed separate things?
[14:00:22] <Velveeta> yes, they're separate values for position, but they behave similarly
[14:00:51] <jphase> sticky is actually a value for position??
[14:01:05] <ericandrewlewis> yeah wut
[14:01:18] <Velveeta> yep
[14:01:23] <Velveeta> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position
[14:01:23] <jphase> I thought it was just a term for toggling fixed positioning at a particular scroll position!  O_O
[14:01:47] <jphase> wow, just blew my mind
[14:01:54] <jphase> I've quite literally never used this
[14:02:08] <ericandrewlewis> mm landed in webkit august 2012...
[14:02:24] <Velveeta> http://i.imgur.com/XmThIem.gif
[14:02:34] <jphase> lol
[14:02:41] <Velveeta> yep, i've only used it a couple times myself, i've only recently had to start dabbling in mobile development
[14:02:52] <Velveeta> it's like taking a step back into the fucking dark ages of IE 5 and 6
[14:03:11] <jphase> okay, how you're able to so quickly link hilarious imagery is borderline creepy Velveeta
[14:03:19] <Velveeta> :D
[14:03:36] <jphase> like you have fucking macros for this shit
[14:03:38] <Velveeta> it's called a lifetime of internet mining skills coupled with typing over 90wpm
[14:04:54] <jphase> <offtopic> I'm kinda disappointed that limechat for mac doesn't support animated .gif images inside the chat window like it does with other formats :[ </offtopic>
[14:05:49] <Velveeta> i'm not even familiar w/ the various irc offerings, i'm only on a mac because that's what my company issued me.. i just use colloquy, and it doesn't do anything fancy like that :D
[14:06:23] <ericandrewlewis> surprisingly this skrollr library supports touch.
[14:06:28] <jphase> I highly recommend limechat, it's simple and not bloated
[14:07:01] <jphase> and it looks like sublime text :D
[14:07:34] <Velveeta> nice, i do enjoy me some sublime
[14:07:41] <ericandrewlewis> heh
[14:08:11] <Velveeta> ericandrewlewis: you may want to also look into scrollorama, i haven't used it, but it appears to support a lot of scroll fanciness, plus touch support, also
[14:08:12] <ericandrewlewis> there are great features of subllime, but really people just like it cause they took a moment to think about what the default font and color scheme would be.
[14:08:47] <ericandrewlewis> pin it then unpin it!
[14:08:53] <ericandrewlewis> Velveeta: thanks!
[14:09:02] <Velveeta> no problemo :)
[14:09:20] <Velveeta> yeah i'm still running the default color scheme on it
[14:09:40] <Velveeta> a coworker came up with an iron man theme for it, but i have no inclination to make the switch, i like my boring terminal colors :D
[14:11:32] <ericandrewlewis> Velveeta: http://johnpolacek.github.io/superscrollorama/ is even more insane
[14:11:56] <Velveeta> ericandrewlewis: that's actually the one i was meaning :)
[14:11:57] <ericandrewlewis> except for the beginning font animation which is hella glitchy
[14:12:05] <Velveeta> yeah, the demo page looks great, i just haven't used it myself yet
[14:12:26] <Velveeta> i have a minion on my team that's all about mobile development, so i'm able to dump all that shit onto him, and i think he's more of a purist about it
[14:13:52] <ericandrewlewis> as in using it minimally?
[14:14:24] <Velveeta> as in not using additional libraries to get the mobile experience, he just does it all w/ minimal js and css apparently
[14:14:47] <Velveeta> i just inherited him from another team like a week ago, so i honestly have no idea what he does until i start seeing his code reviews :D
[14:15:18] <Velveeta> but that's the sense i've always gotten from him was that he just does it enough to know it, and so doesn't like adding the overhead of additional libraries or frameworks to obtain that
[14:15:28] <Velveeta> especially given bandwidth limitations of cellular networks, etc
[14:16:25] * jphase still hasn't found a "patched" version of the latest sublime 3 build :[
[14:37:05] <Velveeta> woo hoo! my new star trek daily desk calendar arrived, just in time for the new year :D
[14:37:26] <jphase> epic, next gen?
[14:37:44] <Velveeta> it's a mix of all series
[14:37:50] <jphase> even better!
[14:37:53] <Velveeta> quotes, trivia facts, etc
[14:38:04] <Velveeta> i know, i love it :D
[14:38:17] <jphase> I have been thinking about rewatching deep space 9. I miss that one
[14:38:33] <Velveeta> the wife got me one last xmas, and then now that i'm off through the new year, i brought it home from work to finish out, and she was like "i'm glad you liked it so much, let's get you another" "yes ma'am!"
[14:38:50] <Velveeta> i'm halfway through ds9, when it was originally airing, i gave up after the first season
[14:39:17] <Velveeta> but now i'm on a mission to make sure i've seen every single episode of every single series, so i started with voyager, am on to ds9 now, then enterprise, then will circle back around to ToS
[14:39:18] <jphase> hah, you sound like you have a good match for significant other
[14:39:29] <Velveeta> i've seen next gen probably a dozen times all the way through already
[14:39:34] <jphase> same
[14:39:51] <Velveeta> yeah, she is a pretty good match :D our first anniversary, she got me next gen, the complete series, on dvd (back then)
[14:39:54] <jphase> my dad was a HUGE treky - I inherited that and his high forehead
[14:40:19] <Velveeta> she started getting conditioned with a pavlovian response since i would watch it every night in bed.. as soon as the theme music started for the opening credits, she was out like a light
[14:40:26] <jphase> yeah, partners that fertilize your nerdiness are essential
[14:40:31] <Velveeta> definitely
[14:41:04] <Velveeta> i've passed my own love of trek on to my progeny.. to start germinating the next generation of trek nerds
[14:52:42] <jphase> how many lil' ones you got Velveeta?
[14:52:51] <Velveeta> just 1
[14:53:00] <Velveeta> which is almost 1 more than i can handle :D
[14:53:05] <jphase> always
[14:57:05] <sunbeam> how can i best test if a  var = "something else now"; contains "else" ?
[14:57:13] <sunbeam> var something i mean
[14:57:26] <jphase> sunbeam: use .indexOf('else')
[14:57:36] <Velveeta> damn, he beat me to it
[14:57:45] <jphase> 'bout time :P
[14:58:10] <sunbeam> thanks
[14:58:13] <jphase> np
[14:58:42] <jphase> I swear when Velveeta is in here I feel like I'm playing jeopardy stoned...
[14:58:48] <Velveeta> lol
[14:59:02] <Velveeta> NOT SO FAST, TREBEK
[14:59:06] <jphase> LOL
[14:59:09] * Velveeta chuckles like Sean Connery.
[14:59:11] <jphase> my FAVORITE SNL episode
[15:00:09] <Velveeta> i pose a conundrum to you, a riddle if you willâ€¦ what's the difference between you, and a mallard with a coldâ€¦.. one's a sick duck.. i forget the rest, but your mother's a whore
[15:00:38] <jphase> hahaha
[15:00:43] <duckgoose> sick duck at your service
[15:00:55] <Velveeta> well played, duckgoose.. well played :D
[15:03:49] <jphase> Velveeta: you do primarily PHP server-side @ work?
[15:04:24] <Velveeta> well, i do primarily front end code at workâ€¦ the little bit of back end stuff i do is in node for my own project, but the primary back end that most of the company's projects run on is c#.net
[15:04:44] <jphase> oic
[15:05:19] <jphase> have any experience with sails?
[15:05:26] <Velveeta> nopers
[15:05:33] <Velveeta> that's a ruby thing or something isn't it?
[15:05:34] * Woet is listening to one of his favorite tracks, "Sail" by AWOLNATION (played 22 times) via Spotify: http://open.spotify.com/track/5k0mTv94djzbl1HvhxjXPn
[15:05:48] <jphase> node MVC ruby-esk
[15:05:53] <Velveeta> gotcha
[15:06:08] <jphase> hah, how appropriate Woet
[15:06:17] <sunbeam> how can i detect if a class with custom- (starting with that) has been clicked?
[15:06:26] <Velveeta> we had a front end hackathon a few months ago, and the guy who's now the mobile component of my team did a project in sails, but that wasn't my hackathon team
[15:06:42] <jphase> sunbeam: $('[class^=custom]').click(function(){
[15:06:59] <jphase> well, you can add the - in there too, muh bad
[15:07:02] <Velveeta> you need to make that a compound selector
[15:07:17] <Velveeta> [class^="custom"],[class*="custom"]
[15:07:27] <tw2113> what type of cheese are you, Velveeta ?
[15:07:32] <jphase> well if it's just starting with, then you don't I thought?
[15:07:35] <Velveeta> tw2113: processed ;)
[15:07:42] <tw2113> well yeah
[15:07:57] <jphase> gelatinous
[15:08:03] <Velveeta> jphase: that's only if the class attribute itself starts with it, but if it's something liek this: class="class1 custom-class class2" then that won't match
[15:08:04] <jphase> jiggly-cheese :D
[15:08:19] <jphase> oh snap, I stand corrected/pwned
[15:08:39] <jphase> sunbeam: listen to Velveeta, those were not the droids you were looking 4
[15:08:46] <Velveeta> now if you have a generic click handler bound, and you want to know if the element that was clicked on has a class that starts with custom-, you'd need to do something different
[15:09:18] <jphase> wouldn't the *= selector cover the first one though?
[15:09:20] <Velveeta> you could do something like if ($(this).attr('class').match(/\bcustom\-\b/)) {}
[15:09:52] <Velveeta> oh yeah, good point, augment that to this:
[15:10:13] <Velveeta> $('[class^="custom-"],[class*=" custom-"]')
[15:10:24] <Velveeta> because you don't want to match against abccustom-class
[15:10:32] <jphase> touchÃ©
[15:10:39] <Velveeta> i knew it had to be a compound selector for some reason :D
[15:11:16] <Velveeta> there's also a classList property you can check in your event handler, which is an array of class names
[15:11:26] <Velveeta> i think that's actually the preferred method of class checking these days
[15:11:37] <jphase> that makes sense, regex engines are slower
[15:11:56] <Velveeta> not supported in IE < 10 though, so depends on your support matrix
[15:12:06] <jphase> I actually switched to Chrome from FF when FF changed their regex engine and my ^= *= selectors whined/broke
[15:12:34] <jphase> which was quickly fixed, but the particular situation I had at the time was mean to FF
[15:13:12] <Velveeta> i've used chrome as long as it's been around, i was anxiously awaiting its first release, but i still used FF for debugging because of firebug
[15:13:23] <Velveeta> until chrome's devtools came of age, and i actually put the time into learning them
[15:13:35] <Velveeta> now i use it pretty exclusively :)
[15:14:00] <jphase> I must say FF's mobile design views are pretty neat
[15:14:30] <jphase> but I hate that their dev tools don't autocomplete css properties and their overall interface is meh for me personally
[15:14:45] <jphase> and I like webkit in general :\
[15:14:53] <tw2113> autocomplete should be coming soon
[15:14:58] <tw2113> i think it may be in beta
[15:15:37] <jphase> good, they've been doing a lot of cool things with FF and that's one of the things that annoy me the most
[15:15:46] <tw2113> i know i have it in alpha, which is presently at version 28
[15:16:12] <Velveeta> have they bothered to split tabs out into separate processes yet?
[15:16:12] <jphase> their mobile platform is pretty neat too, I saw some mozilla employees present it at OScon in my home town
[15:16:23] <Velveeta> that was the main thing that had me chomping at the bit for chrome to initially be released
[15:16:25] <jphase> I don't know honestly :\ tw2113?
[15:16:26] <tw2113> no, they're still working on that one Velveeta
[15:16:33] <Velveeta> sweet, as long as it's at least in the works
[15:16:44] <tw2113> last i heard it was picking up steam again
[15:16:56] <tw2113> jphase, what version are you presently on?
[15:17:06] <jphase> boy, let me run it and check
[15:17:30] <jphase> 24
[15:17:41] <tw2113> get that updated, you may already have it then
[15:17:43] <tw2113> that's a few back
[15:17:53] <tw2113> stable branch should be 26
[15:17:59] <jphase> the fact that I didn't know exhibits how often I run it
[15:18:14] <jphase> 28 beta is a good one to get though for my annoyances?
[15:18:26] <tw2113> 28 alpha you mean?
[15:18:32] <tw2113> yeah i get a lot of the cool stuff earlier
[15:18:39] <tw2113> it's stable enough for my daily use too
[15:18:58] <jphase> well if it's your primary browser and it works for you that's good enough for me for sure
[15:19:11] <tw2113> .g firefox aurora
[15:19:12] <b-ot> tw2113: Mozilla Firefox Web Browser | Download Firefox Aurora for Desktop ... â†’ http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/aurora/
[15:19:38] <tw2113> i keep nightly around too, but that's mostly just to check on incoming features
[15:20:14] <jphase> tw2113: did you code that bot or something? You seem to know every lil' command
[15:20:29] <tw2113> i happened to know the command
[15:20:38] <jphase> `shrug
[15:20:38] <b-ot> jphase: Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯
[15:20:45] <jphase> :D
[15:20:56] <tw2113> actually i'm mostly used to the bot in #wordpress
[15:21:02] <tw2113> and that's one of the valid commands there
[15:21:10] <tw2113> it just happened to work here too
[15:21:17] <jphase> hah, nice
[15:21:20] <jphase> eggdrop?
[15:22:21] <jphase> oh, right, it's not your bot
[15:22:36] <Velveeta> eggdrop soup?
[15:23:00] <tw2113> i'm still happy that Aurora now has split console
[15:23:08] <tw2113> i can have a console on any of the inspector tabs
[15:23:31] <jphase> oh yeah this is muuuuuuch better
[15:23:37] <jphase> dev tools anyhow
[15:24:00] <tw2113> scumbag developers, don't let me have split console on the console tab :(
[15:24:22] * jphase thinks you should write a scathing email
[15:25:02] <tw2113> scathing bugzilla report
[15:25:12] <tw2113> Velveeta, remember, it's pronounced "Christmas Jift"
[15:25:46] * Velveeta facepalms.
[15:29:12] <fossxplorer> Can anyone help to align the images on a column to the right side of the image? http://jsfiddle.net/G9LMd/1/
[15:33:41] <fossxplorer> Using Jquery to set fixed position on scroll, the live page's first image moves to the left :(
[15:42:17] <_biff> hi
[15:42:39] <_biff> could anybody tell me how the hell could i convert a stupid json string to HTML tag?
[15:42:52] <_biff> because in the html i get the tag with "" marks
[15:43:03] <_biff> i cant remove it
[15:43:03] <_biff> yes i tried google
[15:43:05] <Velveeta> json isn't meant to be htmlâ€¦ is one of the properties an html string?
[15:43:17] <Velveeta> fossxplorer i'm taking a look at yours right now
[15:43:17] <_biff> there really stupid answers which arent works
[15:43:46] <_biff> Velveeta ?
[15:44:12] <_biff> Velveeta what could i do with this information what i know:)
[15:44:19] <Velveeta> _biff: json is javascript object notation, html html markup, so unless of the properties of your javascript object is valid markup, you can't "convert" a json string to an html tag
[15:44:41] <Velveeta> er "html html markup" should be "not html markup"
[15:44:46] <_biff> Velveeta understand well... how could i get hmtl tags
[15:44:46] <fossxplorer> Velveeta, i've done some changes to the code so perhaps i should rather show you the live site?
[15:44:52] <_biff> from json
[15:44:52] <_biff> thats all my question
[15:45:10] <Velveeta> _biff: but your question doesn't make sense as it's stated, i'm trying to get more details out of you
[15:45:26] <Velveeta> _biff: can you make an example on jsfiddle of what your json string looks like and what html you're trying to convert it to?
[15:45:32] <Velveeta> fossxplorer: that's fine
[15:45:33] <_biff> Velveeta thank you
[15:45:42] <_biff> Velveeta öm...
[15:45:49] <_biff> maybe...
[15:45:50] <_biff> wait
[15:47:35] <fossxplorer> Velveeta, http://ocbeta.myftp.org/
[15:47:48] <Velveeta> 403 forbidden
[15:48:15] <fossxplorer> Now?
[15:48:23] <Velveeta> that worked
[15:49:20] <Velveeta> so you're just wanting to make that side bar float down the page next to the images?
[15:49:40] <fossxplorer> Great. I almost got what i wanted, except i need to align id lorem1 with featureContent horizontally, is that possible?
[15:50:42] <fossxplorer> Oh, yes and that works. but when it "docks" back into the original placement, the first image start too far down..
[15:52:46] <fossxplorer> If i remove the overflow:hidden from featureContent i get the images div further up, but then the first image moves to the left on scroll down
[15:54:46] <_biff> Velveeta i dont think thats so complicated to do in jsfiddle...its asimple tagging...
[15:54:55] <_biff> Velveeta http://pastebin.com/F8deGYqN
[15:54:57] <_biff> instead:)
[15:55:22] <fossxplorer> Velveeta, http://postimg.org/image/puph5ya41/ and http://postimg.org/image/vu6l4iqap/
[15:55:52] <_biff> Velveeta so the question is simple...how can i remove the " marks when i put to the html div with jquery
[15:56:09] <Velveeta> _biff: on your ajax request, do you have the dataType specified as 'json' or is it coming back as something else?
[15:57:09] <Velveeta> your problem isn't that you need to remove the " marks, it's that your greater than and less than brackets are being encoded as &gt; and &lt;
[15:57:32] <_biff> Velveeta ofcourse
[15:57:58] <_biff> velvet i alerted this html div...and yes i got extra chars
[15:58:08] <_biff> &gt; and &lt; as you say
[15:58:30] <_biff> but my question is how could i remove this and replace the real <> signs
[15:58:40] <_biff> *with the real <>
[15:58:53] <_biff> so to be a html tag
[15:59:21] <Velveeta> _biff: http://jsfiddle.net/JEjLp/1/
[15:59:22] <_biff> Velveeta sorry i understand yes the datatype is json
[15:59:30] <Velveeta> you shouldn't need to do any conversion of the text
[15:59:55] <Velveeta> if you're receiving that as an actual json object, you should be able to do just what you have there in your code, this fiddle uses your json object and your code to assign it to #html_message
[16:00:28] <_biff> but...
[16:00:38] <Velveeta> try alerting your response.html_message property itself
[16:00:44] <Velveeta> it could be that it's coming through already encoded
[16:00:55] <_biff> [00:57] <_biff> velvet i alerted this html div...and yes i got extra chars
[16:01:01] <_biff> [00:58] <_biff> &gt; and &lt; as you say
[16:01:09] <Velveeta> _biff: i know, i read that
[16:01:15] <Velveeta> i'm showing you that with a valid json object, that's not the case
[16:01:20] <Velveeta> fossxplorer: i'm still trying to figure out yours btw
[16:01:57] <Velveeta> _biff: can you paste your ajax code somewhere?
[16:02:06] <_biff> which party...
[16:02:09] <fossxplorer> Velveeta, really appreciate it, just take your time. I have 3 more days to complete the front page :)
[16:02:09] <_biff> -y
[16:02:24] <Velveeta> _biff: your entire call to the $.ajax function
[16:05:00] <_biff> Velveeta http://pastebin.com/NYUVG493
[16:05:34] <_biff> Velveeta its working well..
[16:05:55] <_biff> i also get the right infos from db...everything is correct...but this html inserting...
[16:06:00] <Velveeta> _biff: and if you alert(response.html_message) what do you get?
[16:06:19] <_biff> wait
[16:07:00] <_biff> &lt;img src=https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/262404_649558728392281_1095204616_n.jpg&gt;
[16:07:03] <_biff> Velveeta
[16:07:30] <Velveeta> _biff: then there's your problemâ€¦ it's being sent to you with those brackets already encoded, as opposed to an actual html string
[16:07:45] <_biff> yes i know
[16:07:49] <_biff> but how could i decode?
[16:07:50] <_biff> :)
[16:09:17] <Velveeta> _biff: you'll have to just use a string.replace() method to do it, response.html_message.replace('&gt;', '>').replace('&lt;', '<')
[16:09:36] <Velveeta> but that's a sloppy method of doing it, because you never know what else may be coming through encoded, and that only catches 2 specific cases of it
[16:09:46] <_biff> Velveeta i mean i tried that...
[16:09:51] <Velveeta> you'd be better off finding the code that's encoding it before transport from the server, and fixing it
[16:09:55] <_biff> then the extra chars gone
[16:10:00] <_biff> but still get " marks in html
[16:10:06] <_biff> if i well remembered
[16:10:18] <_biff> sorry i tried many things..
[16:10:41] <Velveeta> what " marks are you talking about in the html?
[16:11:07] <Velveeta> the pastebin you posted shows this as the html content: &lt;img src=https://fbcdn-sphotos-a-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/262404_649558728392281_1095204616_n.jpg&gt;
[16:11:14] <Velveeta> there's no quotes in that string anywhere
[16:11:41] <_biff> Velveeta hm...its now working...
[16:11:42] <_biff> :D
[16:11:45] <_biff> this replace...
[16:11:54] <_biff> ahhh  f....
[16:11:55] <_biff> thak you
[16:12:00] <Velveeta> no problem
[16:12:29] <Velveeta> but like i said, that's a bad way of doing that, you need to fix the actual problem going on, that's just a bandaid
[16:14:07] <fossxplorer> Velveeta, what about having 2 table columns, 1 for featureContent and 1 for lorem1?
[16:14:26] <_biff> Velveeta yes i htmlencoded that object...
[16:14:29] <_biff> i see now
[16:15:05] <Velveeta> fossxplorer: that would probably work also, i've been playing with display: inline-block and floats and whatnot, but they all cause their own special kinds of quirks with the existing css
[16:15:07] <_biff> the next problem is how could i put more img tags into this one "html_message"...i got parse error
[16:15:16] <_biff> but many thanks..
[16:15:17] <_biff> :)
[16:15:30] <Velveeta> _biff: turn html_message into an array
[16:16:02] <_biff> in josn?
[16:16:29] <Velveeta> yep
[16:16:40] <fossxplorer> Velveeta, yep, i did the same and see the same problematic behavior as well :(
[16:16:40] <_biff> but my idea is....in this field there would be mixed messages with links ...image src-s...others...
[16:17:09] <_biff> withoput of course html tags...i put the html tags after the db query
[16:18:22] <_biff> so i have to make pieces of this one db string...and after i extended with the proper tags i make a new and i would put into the html_message
[16:18:25] <Velveeta> _biff: you should just send the urls, and construct the img tags in the browser
[16:18:37] <_biff> öm...
[16:18:55] <_biff> in the browser?
[16:20:21] <Velveeta> yes, just loop through the urls you're sening back and inject your own markup that includes it
[16:20:37] <Velveeta> like $('#html_message').html('<img src="' + url + '" />');
[16:21:25] <_biff> Velveeta hm...
[17:27:28] <dekiss> why I can't output value of element's background position?
[17:27:44] <Velveeta> depends on how you're trying
[17:28:34] <dekiss> console.log(document.getElementById("aaa").style.backgroundPosition);
[17:28:47] <dekiss> it returns empty value
[17:28:59] <dekiss> I set it to 0px 0px with css
[17:29:37] <dekiss> Velveeta ^
[17:29:57] <Velveeta> works for me in a test case, can you make a jsfiddle out of it?
[17:30:47] <dekiss> yes
[17:30:48] <dekiss> works fine
[17:30:48] <dekiss> but in my code it isn't
[17:30:48] <dekiss> it is a huge code..
[17:31:09] <Velveeta> what if you try using jquery to fetch that property, since this is the jquery channel?
[17:31:18] <Velveeta> $('#aaa').css('background-position') ?
[17:31:35] <dekiss> but why I can't with javascript :S
[17:31:37] <dekiss> omg
[17:31:42] <dekiss> it was ok 1 mi n ago
[17:31:53] <dekiss> in those times I want to sleep :)
[17:32:11] <dekiss> man pls help
[17:32:12] <Velveeta> if it was ok 1 minute ago, and is not now, then something has changed
[17:32:19] <Velveeta> javascript doesn't just work sometimes and sometimes not
[17:32:21] <dekiss> I can't output any element background position
[17:32:33] <dekiss> any idea why?>
[17:32:34] <Velveeta> i can help if you can whip me up a test case...
[17:34:00] <dekiss> yeah
[17:34:08] <dekiss> I can't output values of background position
[17:34:15] <dekiss> but I can change background position..........
[17:34:37] <Velveeta> i know, you've said this multiple times now, that still doesn't help generate me a test case
[17:36:36] <vladikoff> I have a testcase packed: http://christmasexperiments.com/2013/01/
[17:37:29] <dekiss> http://jsfiddle.net/4hERL/
[17:37:32] <dekiss> Velveeta ^
[17:37:37] <dekiss> this sayiong undefind :S
[17:38:15] <dekiss> yeah Velveeta ty my example you will see no output in console :S
[17:38:31] <dekiss> bug?
[17:39:36] <vladikoff> dekiss, $('#notWorking').css('backgroundPosition')
[17:39:56] <dekiss> vladikoff why my example is not working
[17:40:02] <dekiss> I want to use javascript lets say
[17:40:02] <Velveeta> dekiss: there's no background position assigned to that element
[17:40:15] <dekiss> there is
[17:40:15] <dekiss> ahh o
[17:40:15] <dekiss> lol
[17:40:15] <dekiss> sec
[17:40:17] <vladikoff> dekiss, use jquery
[17:40:17] <Velveeta> also, this is the jquery channel, we're advocating that you use jquery functions
[17:40:34] <Velveeta> there's a #javascript channel on irc also, which would be better suited to asking native js questions
[17:40:39] <dekiss> background-position: 0px 0px;
[17:40:43] <dekiss> BUT WHY
[17:40:47] <vladikoff> dekiss, http://jsfiddle.net/4hERL/3/
[17:40:48] <dekiss> I have this in my css:(((((((((
[17:41:18] <Velveeta> if you use jquery, you get 0% 0%
[17:41:31] <Velveeta> you didn't supply any css stylings in your example, so this is what we have to go on
[17:42:01] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, the change (adding the -1) is published, you can check out the behavior (no zooming occurs)
[17:42:08] <Velveeta> and if i add a css entry for #notWorking { background-position: 0px 0px; } then jquery reports it properly
[17:42:15] <dekiss> I have background position written in my css file
[17:42:21] <Velveeta> cryp71c: ok, i'll check it in a minute :)
[17:42:21] <dekiss> and the element has bg position set i check
[17:42:55] <dekiss> http://jsfiddle.net/4hERL/7/
[17:43:01] <dekiss> if it is set with css is not working why?
[17:43:02] <Velveeta> dekiss: css properties are not available on the style object
[17:43:05] <dekiss> this is bug
[17:43:15] <dekiss> m?
[17:43:20] <dekiss> I didn't understood you
[17:43:25] <Velveeta> they're available via the computedStyles function, which is a collapse of css styles and element-level inline styles
[17:43:42] <dekiss> so I can't get background position ?
[17:43:43] <Velveeta> if you apply background-position via css, and try to reference it on the .style object w/ native js, you won't get anything
[17:43:49] <Velveeta> sure you canâ€¦ USE JQUERY
[17:43:57] <dekiss> I mean with js
[17:44:00] <Velveeta> http://jsfiddle.net/4hERL/5/
[17:44:07] <Velveeta> you can with js also, that's how jquery does it
[17:44:13] <Velveeta> but that's outside of the scope of this channel
[17:44:14] <tw2113> jquery is js
[17:44:27] <tw2113> </generalleeobvious>
[17:44:28] <Velveeta> so you can use jquery functionality, or you can try the #javascript channel to help you with the native js implementation
[17:44:34] <dekiss> how jquery gtes bg position then?
[17:44:41] <dekiss> how can I do this with plain js?
[17:44:47] <Velveeta> ok, vladikoff is next in line
[17:44:52] <dekiss> Velveeta but jquery is js..
[17:44:54] <Velveeta> dekiss: #javascript
[17:44:59] <Velveeta> i know jquery is javascript
[17:45:09] <dekiss> I want to know what will jquery do behind the scenes
[17:45:12] <Velveeta> but this channel is specifically for issues with the jquery api and jquery plugins
[17:45:16] <tw2113> read the source?
[17:45:17] <Velveeta> then read the jquery src
[17:45:19] <dekiss> ok
[17:45:19] <Velveeta> right
[17:45:23] <dekiss> Velveeta thank a lot!
[17:45:26] <dekiss> and all
[17:45:31] <tw2113> Velveeta, did you know that jquery is js :D
[17:45:35] <tw2113> trollolol
[17:45:37] <dekiss> Velveeta nice explanation i lwill investigate this :)
[17:45:40] <Velveeta> of course i knew that :D
[17:45:44] <dekiss> haa
[17:45:55] <Velveeta> vladikoff: did you have an actual test case at that url, or was that just for fun? :D
[17:46:16] <Velveeta> because it was indeed fun
[17:47:04] <tw2113> Cheese, how much do you look up stuff yourself in the path of answering questions, instead of just telling them to google it themselves?
[17:47:25] <Velveeta> i look things up to a reasonable degree, depending on the nature of the question
[17:47:55] <tw2113> ever find yourself answering questions that you end up obsessing about finding an answer for?
[17:47:57] <Velveeta> in the case of this, where the functionality is a core feature of jquery, i'll say use jquery, or else if you want to know how they do it, read the src
[17:47:58] <dekiss> I go very deep -_-
[17:48:02] <dekiss> I want to know everything
[17:48:06] <Velveeta> tw2113: definitely
[17:48:13] <dekiss> thats why when I use jquery I research how it does stuff
[17:48:33] <tw2113> i'm the same with WordPress
[17:48:47] <dekiss> tw2113 yeah I know you from #wordpress :)
[17:51:25] <dekiss> next question, why this retun 0%? parseInt($('#filmReelImg').css('background-position')))
[17:51:46] <dekiss> hm
[17:51:47] <dekiss> nvm
[17:51:50] <dekiss> my fault
[17:52:17] <Velveeta> cryp71c: hooray for browser-hanging :D
[17:53:44] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, ha, I hadn't noticed. Perhaps that's why it seems nothing is happening.
[17:53:55] <Velveeta> yeah i'm checking it out now :)
[17:54:26] <Velveeta> ok, i found the problem :D
[17:54:32] <Velveeta> add a -1 to the while condition also
[17:54:50] <Velveeta> while (frames[frame++].end < starMapPlanet.length - 1)
[17:58:01] <vladikoff> Velveeta, jqconf austin good times :D
[17:58:12] <Velveeta> :D
[17:58:15] <Siecje> If I double click on 'Jane' and delete the text and click away from the form, I don't see any orange of the new empty text. Even if I put a space instead of empty string. The best I could come up with is the underscore http://jsfiddle.net/rh6fD/8/
[17:58:40] <Velveeta> vladikoff: me and one of my bosses are gonna try to present at jsconf in florida next year too
[17:58:52] <vladikoff> Velveeta, Toronto is coming up also
[17:59:03] <Velveeta> i don't have a passport yet
[17:59:19] <Velveeta> but should be applying for one in the next week or so, because the wife booked us a trip for june, so i'm gonna need it :D
[17:59:24] <DarkGhost> hello everyone and good xmsa eve.
[17:59:25] <DarkGhost> or merry
[17:59:26] <DarkGhost> or whatever
[17:59:34] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, cannot read property start frame.start
[17:59:40] <Velveeta> merry christmahanukwanzakuh
[18:00:19] <Velveeta> cryp71c: lemme take a look real quick
[18:00:24] <DarkGhost> question for yall
[18:00:37] <DarkGhost> http://devcollective.net/obie what would be the best method to have a sort of slideshow with the arrows very below
[18:00:43] <DarkGhost> so you push on right arrow and it moves to right for another text
[18:00:44] <DarkGhost> and so on
[18:00:56] <DarkGhost> should I just do an onclick with a slide animation or something?
[18:02:07] <Velveeta> cryp71c: oh, it's not published yet :D
[18:02:20] <Cryp71c> Velveeta, continued thanks...im typing with on screen keyboard...so hard.
[18:02:27] <Velveeta> heheheh
[18:02:30] <Cryp71c> 1sec
[18:02:36] <Velveeta> no problem
[18:02:39] <DarkGhost> any idea
[18:02:46] <Cryp71c> now
[18:04:21] <Velveeta> siecje: you don't see any orange because you're emptying the value, there's nothing to highlight orange
[18:06:28] <DarkGhost> guys is there a way to slide to the right and hide/show div
[18:06:28] <DarkGhost> ?
[18:07:23] <Velveeta> cryp71c: wrap that requestAnimationFrame call in a check for: if (frame) {
[18:07:46] <Velveeta> it's emptying out the frames array and continuing to try to process it, the array.shift() function is just returning nothing at that point :)
[18:11:23] <Cryp71c_> Velveeta, got dc'd, did i miss anything ?
[18:11:40] <Velveeta> yepyep
[18:11:49] <Velveeta> Velveeta: cryp71c: wrap that requestAnimationFrame call in a check for: if (frame) {
[18:11:49] <Velveeta> [8:07pm] Velveeta: it's emptying out the frames array and continuing to try to process it, the array.shift() function is just returning nothing at that point
[18:17:51] <Velveeta> cryp71c_: when you're all done with that, i have 1 final optimization you can throw in :)
[18:18:53] <Cryp71c_> Velveeta, done, looks good
[18:19:03] <Velveeta> sweet
[18:19:17] <Velveeta> so now the last thing you could do to that is what's called debouncing your event listener
[18:19:42] <Velveeta> that thing looks like it's set to fire on scroll events to determine zoom level
[18:20:29] <Velveeta> however, when i barely scroll up or down, i can see that all those calculations are being fired multiple times, because they're firing for each of those scroll events
[18:20:59] <Velveeta> if you debounce those events say, 0.25s or so, it'll still seem pretty instantaneous to the user, but you make sure you don't catch any of the intermediate scroll events, only the final one
[18:23:58] <Cryp71c_> in debouncing them, you could scroll up a TON but it would only zoom in once?
[18:24:10] <Velveeta> yepyep
[18:24:40] <Velveeta> so the way it works is that upon the event being received, it starts a timeout timer.. if the event is received again before that timer expires, it resets the timer.. only when the timer expires does it fire the event
[18:25:25] <Velveeta> that way you get it to fire Nms after the event stops, it can help reduce calculation overhead, and dom manipulation overhead, to help things flow more easily when they do fire
[18:26:17] <Velveeta> because really, if the person zooms in 3x on a single scroll, you don't need to see each intermittent zoom stage for a fraction of an instant, only the final one, but without debouncing, you incur all of the overhead of doing those calculations and editing all of those offset values 3x to display the final state
[18:27:01] <Siecje> If I double click Jane and remove the text and click away from the field I don't see the new text in orange. Even if I set the text on the span to a space. The best I could do is an underscore http://jsfiddle.net/rh6fD/8/
[18:27:38] <Velveeta> siecje: i already answered your issueâ€¦ if you remove the text, there's nothing *to* highlight orange..
[18:27:44] <Velveeta> so how do you want to handle that?
[18:29:55] <Velveeta> we're watching Casino tonight.. because i think there's a christmas-related scene somewhere in the movie, so that makes it a christmas movie
[18:29:56] <Siecje> highlight a space?
[18:30:09] <Velveeta> siecje: ok
[18:30:21] <Siecje> but that doesn't seem to work
[18:30:54] <Velveeta> siecje: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/rh6fD/11/
[18:32:14] <Cryp71c_> Velveeta, thanks! i can manage that. I'm sure you'll find me here again soon
[18:32:49] <Velveeta> cryp71c_: no problemo, let me see if i can dig up a decent article on doing it in raw jsâ€¦ it's fairly easy to implement, unless you've never done it before, and then it could be confusing :)
[18:33:13] <Velveeta> i typically use underscore for it since we already have that loaded as a dependency, but jquery itself has no function for it by default
[18:33:19] <Siecje> ok I also tried that but not with html tag
[18:33:44] <Velveeta> siecje: yeah, text() will probably convert the ampersand to an entity, like &amp;nbsp;
[18:34:07] <Velveeta> cryp71c_: here you go: http://unscriptable.com/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/
[18:34:51] <Velveeta> cryp71c_: here's one more: http://davidwalsh.name/function-debounce
[18:37:26] <Velveeta> cryp71c_: also, re: our earlier conversation of optimizations in general, this seems to be a pretty decent blog entry on various optimization methods in general for you: http://gregfranko.com/blog/javascript-performance-tips/
[18:42:04] <Siecje> Velveeta: thanks
[18:42:10] <Velveeta> siecje: no problemo
[18:44:04] <Velveeta> vladikoff: so one of my coworkers the other day, brought one of those 3d headsets like i think you were using in your voxel demo stuff
[18:44:21] <vladikoff> Velveeta, nice!
[18:44:22] <Velveeta> fancy stuff
[18:44:36] <Velveeta> yeah, people were getting dizzy in em, i was like "oo! i wanna be dizzy too!"
[18:45:21] <vladikoff> Velveeta, yeah, the higher resolution version should fix that hopefully
[18:45:41] <Velveeta> he said it was a developers kit, like $300'ish, that was a lot less than i thought it would have been
[18:45:49] <vladikoff> Velveeta, yeap
[19:21:45] <dekiss> can I somehow use jquery on some javascript selector?
[19:25:06] <dekiss> $("#img_cont div")[i2].animate({
[19:25:16] <dekiss> waht is wrong here?
[19:27:42] <shoky> dekiss: .eq(i2) instead of [i2]    that wraps it for you in a jquery obj
[19:30:11] <codepython777> http://bpaste.net/show/uLSTfapxm99Eztf3Pk7N/ - correctEl is null - how do i write this code so that when correctEl is not null, this works? Or perhaps I'm doing something wrong?
[19:32:10] <Velveeta> codepython777: wrap it in a check for: if (correctEl) { }
[19:32:40] <codepython777> Velveeta: stupid mistake. got it. Was a class.
[19:34:23] <codepython777> Velveeta: Just replaced - var correctEl = document.getElementsByClassName("correct") - but now i get - Object#<NodeList> has no addEventListener
[19:34:49] <Velveeta> codepython777: getElementsByClassName returns a nodeList object, not an element object
[19:35:03] <Velveeta> why are you using jquery for document.ready, but not using it for node selection?
[19:35:16] <Velveeta> just change that to var correctEl = $('.correct'); much shorter
[19:35:36] <codepython777> Thanks. I read somewhere that addEventListner was better ?
[19:35:45] <Velveeta> better than what?
[19:36:06] <codepython777> Than using $()
[19:36:15] <codepython777> stackoverflow
[19:36:18] <Velveeta> jquery used addEventListener internally
[19:36:31] <Velveeta> can you point me to that stackoverflow page? â€¦..so i can downvote that answer?
[19:36:37] <systemfault> Good luck using addEventListener on IE8.
[19:37:30] <codepython777> I closed it, if i find it will let you know. Thanks.
[19:37:46] <Velveeta> +1 for systemfault
[19:39:09] <codepython777> thanks
[19:39:34] <systemfault> codepython777: jQuery's main feature imho is normalization... its functions work on all browsers. You can go the "Vanilla DOM" route if you want but you'll have some shiming to do.
[19:39:36] <codepython777> http://bpaste.net/show/44udNBqIOUMX1iI1QXbS/ - this seems to be working. Any comments on this code?
[19:40:08] <Velveeta> nope, looks fine to me
[19:58:58] <codepython777> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/fuXL3/  - how do i move the string "Indeed C Rocks" in this example to the html and pick it up automatically. I am trying to create multiple such questions in my html
[20:00:30] <codepython777> something like this - http://jsfiddle.net/fuXL3/2/
[20:00:39] <codepython777> but i want to pick those strings in js from the html
[20:02:13] <Velveeta> codepython777: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/fuXL3/3/
[20:03:00] <Velveeta> you can just attach it as a data attribute, and then grab both of those nodes and treat them genericallyâ€¦ on click, just alert their data('message') value
[20:04:04] <codepython777> The problem is that the strings might be large - paragraphs. Hence i was trying to dynamically pull it out from the html - http://jsfiddle.net/fuXL3/2/ - by hiding them in css
[20:04:24] <Velveeta> ok that's fine also, i'll alter mine
[20:04:54] <codepython777> thanks
[20:05:43] <Velveeta> here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/fuXL3/4/
[20:07:00] <codepython777> Velveeta: Thanks!
[20:07:04] <Velveeta> no problem :)
[20:10:32] <Cryp71c_> Velveeta, For storing large amounts of data (say I wanted to fetch all the timeline data for every planet so the timeline changes were done client side), what would be the best approach for storing all of that data?
[20:11:28] <Velveeta> cryp71c_: depending on the size of the rendered json string, i'd just throw it all into a json string, server-side, and dump it into the outgoing page load into a script tag so it was immediately available
[20:12:31] <Velveeta> failing that, if it's a fairly sizable chunk, i'd probably load the page without it, but immediately fire off an ajax callback to retrieve that data asynchronously, and make all events that trigger that redraw contingent on the completion of that ajax request, so just tie it to the .done callback of the xhr object
[20:12:58] <Velveeta> after the request completes, all other events will fire immediately, but any that are issued before it completes will just go into a queue to be processed when it completes
[20:13:09] <hugo_moss> im making an ios web app, and i need an event to be run when i do a swipe, but then account and get the scrolltop position after inertial decceleration
[20:14:29] <Velveeta> does ios trigger an event upon scrollstop?
[20:15:02] <hugo_moss> yeah but it doesn't account for inertial decceleration
[20:15:18] <Velveeta> well that's what i mean by scrollstop, like final stop
[20:16:15] <Velveeta> the only way to force knowledge of the final stop is gonna be to, during the scroll, start a polling interval to check scrollTop() or something, and when 2 consecutive polls show the same value, you know the page has stopped, and can cancel the interval and fire your callback
[20:20:38] <hugo_moss> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11177774/setinterval-pauses-in-iphone-ipad-mobile-safari-during-scrolling
[20:22:01] <Velveeta> okâ€¦. so that doesn't really change my answer, unless you're asking something different than i think you're asking
[20:22:21] <Velveeta> are you wanting to know when the scrolling has made its final stop, or when the initial scroll has stopped but it's still in the process of decelerating?
[20:22:59] <hugo_moss> what im trying to do is get real-time scroll detection
[20:23:15] <Velveeta> how near-real-time would you consider real-time?
[20:23:58] <hugo_moss> i dont know
[20:24:00] <Velveeta> because i was advocating running an interval poller that would compare scrollTop from one check to the nextâ€¦ if you set that interval to something small, like 100ms, it would take roughly 1/4s for it to react
[20:24:06] <Velveeta> which should be negligable to the user
[20:24:46] <hugo_moss> see what happens is
[20:24:47] <Velveeta> if you need a tighter timing than that, you could drop it to say, 50ms, or 25ms
[20:25:15] <hugo_moss> when i place my finger on the screen, and scroll, the event isnt fired until i release my finger
[20:25:19] <hugo_moss> which is the problem
[20:25:31] <Velveeta> gotcha
[20:25:33] <hugo_moss> im trying to make it fire once a move has been made
[20:25:42] <hugo_moss> before releasing the finger
[20:25:50] <Velveeta> so then this isn't an inertial scrolling issue, it's more of a touchend kind of issue
[20:25:59] <hugo_moss> yea
[20:26:06] <hugo_moss> polling shouldve fixed that
[20:26:11] <Velveeta> and scroll doesn't fire during a touchmove?
[20:26:12] <hugo_moss> but apparently it pauses on touching
[20:26:27] <Velveeta> how about you bind to touchdrag?
[20:26:28] <hugo_moss> in ios, scroll is only fired after youve stopped scrolling
[20:26:32] <Velveeta> or what is it, touchmove?
[20:26:41] <hugo_moss> tried touchmove as well
[20:26:51] <hugo_moss> let me try it again and tell you the problem with that was
[20:27:06] <Velveeta> well, you may get better help on this particular issue in an #ios channel or something
[20:27:21] <Velveeta> my guess is that those people may have a better idea of how to handle the quirks of ios events
[20:27:55] <hugo_moss> ok well the problem with touchmove is that its fired right when it senses a move, but i need it after the move
[20:28:16] <hugo_moss> i guess that would be touchend
[20:28:31] <hugo_moss> no
[20:28:36] <hugo_moss> its before touchend
[20:28:41] <hugo_moss> but after touchmove
[20:28:58] <Velveeta> does touchmove not fire constantly?
[20:29:06] <Velveeta> as you drag?
[20:29:38] <Velveeta> try debouncing it for 100ms
[20:30:11] <hugo_moss> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11546240/when-is-touchmove-actually-fired
[20:30:47] <Velveeta> ok, but that doesn't answer the question of how often it fires in ios
[20:30:51] <Cryp71c_> Velveeta, the main page load is done by the time the data for planets and timelines would be pulled, so it couldn't be stuffed into a script tag. I could return it in an ajax call and make the assignment via the JS there, or I could fetch hthe data and attach it to each planet's dom element via data?
[20:32:59] <Velveeta> cryp71c_: it'd probably be faster to store it in some central object structure and do lookups on it based on an element identifier, and that way you don't have to continue reassign data on elements as timelines are changed or zooms are done
[20:43:38] <hugo_moss> velveeta i cant find any information on that
[20:43:45] <hugo_moss> how do you interpret this:
[20:43:47] <hugo_moss> touchmove
[20:43:47] <hugo_moss> Sent when a given event moves on the surface.
[20:44:01] <Velveeta> i would think it fires pretty constantly as you drag around
[20:44:24] <hugo_moss> let me test it on the ipad
[20:44:32] <Velveeta> but the easiest way to determine that is gonna be to just console.log() something or output something on touchmove and see how often it fires
[20:44:59] <ericandrewlewis> it'd be rad to have a website that you interact with and tells you about event firing in real time
[20:46:43] <Velveeta> that's a pretty good idea actually
[20:48:15] <hugo_moss> yeah you were right
[20:48:20] <hugo_moss> its fired constantly
[20:48:32] <Velveeta> ok cool, so you should be able to debounce that event by 50-100ms
[20:48:45] <Velveeta> and whenever that triggers, it means it hasn't heard a touchmove event in that long, and go ahead and fire the callback
[20:48:57] <hugo_moss> how do i debounce? i havent heard of the term before
[20:50:05] <Velveeta> well, my first question would be: do you have underscore or lodash included as part of your js?
[20:50:11] <Velveeta> if so, debouncing is simple :)
[20:50:25] <hugo_moss> nah
[20:50:55] <Velveeta> ok then, i can point you to a couple of articles that discuss implementing it
[20:51:23] <hugo_moss> ok thank you
[20:51:26] <Velveeta> but the quick and dirty summary is that you set a timeout to expire when that event fires, and if it fires again before your timeout expires, you reset the timeout, and only when it expires do you trigger your callback
[20:51:57] <Velveeta> that way, for events like scroll and resize, which fire constantly, you only trigger your callback once, when it's been a certain time since the last event was triggers, say, 100ms after scrolling stops
[20:52:23] <Velveeta> to the user, it still feels pretty instantaneous, but your client doesn't incur all the overhead of constantly processing during a constantly triggered scroll event
[20:52:43] <hugo_moss> (touchmove)
[20:53:01] <hugo_moss> ok im excited
[20:53:07] <hugo_moss> i hope it works
[20:53:11] <Velveeta> here are a couple of articles: http://unscriptable.com/2009/03/20/debouncing-javascript-methods/
[20:53:15] <Velveeta> http://blog.pengoworks.com/index.cfm/2009/3/24/Managing-JavaScript-eventsfunctions-using-debouncing
[20:53:39] <Velveeta> they discuss the concept and reasoning behind it, as well as how to go about implementing it
[20:53:57] <Velveeta> and if you feel like dropping in a copy of underscore or lodash, they have a debounce function built in
[21:33:19] <speaker123> not sure what this is called in javascript/jquery land.
[21:33:27] <speaker123> in python, its called pcolor or imshow
[21:33:54] <speaker123> ...i have a float array and would like to color it...possibly a vector or matrix
[21:34:01] <speaker123> any library well-known for this?
[21:35:25] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what a float array isâ€¦ an array of floating point values?
[21:36:00] <Velveeta> if you're looking for a decent js graphics library that can handle vectors, you might try raphael
[21:36:08] <hugo_moss> ok velveeta
[21:36:16] <hugo_moss> so the debounce function
[21:36:21] <Velveeta> yessir
[21:37:25] <hugo_moss> so on every mouse move, it sets a timeout with a callback to be called after a threshold, if theres another mousemove, it clears the previous timeout, and creates a new one, with the same delay, and so on until there are no more events,
[21:37:34] <hugo_moss> and the callback executes?
[21:38:44] <Velveeta> yep, the setTimeout has your callback in itâ€¦ if the event fires again, you clear that timeout and reset it, so when that timeout expires, it just fires the callback you handed it, one time
[21:38:54] <Cryp71c_> Velveeta, in the interest of saving a great deal of my time, I might steal a very small amount of yours; needing to store 31 timelines worth of data across 3139 planets, will it be more prudent to store planets as the outer set of elements when building the object from a json string or to store timelines as the outer elements?
[21:39:10] <Cryp71c_> (regarding performance)
[21:39:12] <Velveeta> so if you give it like a 50-100ms timeout, then constant scrolling will trigger it repeatedly, and when you stop scrolling, it'll fire within 50-100ms
[21:39:32] <Cryp71c_> Velveeta, apparently today is the day for lessons on debouncing?
[21:40:04] <Velveeta> cryp71c_: heheheh yep, but they're valuable lessons :D
[21:40:23] <Velveeta> and i would store the timelines as the outer set
[21:41:13] <hugo_moss> thank you velveeta sir
[21:41:20] <hugo_moss> gonna try it out now
[21:41:21] <Cryp71c_> I'll make an attempt at client-siding the timelines and see how it plays. I'm hopeful given the results of my work with you today.
[21:41:25] <Velveeta> hugo_moss: no problemo, hopefully that works out for you
[21:41:40] <Velveeta> cryp71c_: sounds good, good luck :)
[21:44:03] <Velveeta> speaker123: aside from raphael, you might also look at paper js, i know it supports svg imports/exports, but not sure how you'd pass it an array of float values
[21:46:57] <hugo_moss> ok hmm it works as expected but the problem is it doesn't fire until i've released my finger
[21:47:25] <Velveeta> i wonder if it's detecting teeny tiny little touchmoves while your finger is still attached
[21:52:38] <speaker123> pape.js is quite amazing
[21:52:57] <Velveeta> yeah, the demos are at least, i haven't used it for anything myself yet
[21:54:47] <joroci> that is cool
[22:11:56] <DarkGhost> http://devcollective.net/obie is there a plugin for an img slideshow but for text? http://devcollective.net/obie the very bottom with the blue arrows.. or is there a better method?
[22:14:59] <DarkGhost> anyone ! :( I've been googling and can't find any good
[22:19:07] <hugo_moss> velveeta yes that is the case
[22:19:21] <hugo_moss> it is detecting miniscule touchmoves while my finger is on the screen
[22:20:15] <Velveeta> in that case, you might want to make it check scrollTop position with each triggerring, and when it receives 2 triggers where the scrollTops match, fire the callback
[22:20:47] <Velveeta> 2 *consecutive* triggers that is
[22:20:49] <hugo_moss> ok cool
[22:21:30] <Velveeta> and on that note, i'm outta here, santa's had a full day of tech support and watching magical js-learnin' videos
[22:21:47] <hugo_moss> ok velveeta
[22:22:02] <hugo_moss> you can't stay 4 or so more hours
[22:22:11] <hugo_moss> we need you
[22:22:13] <Velveeta> heheheh nope, it's midnight here :D
[22:22:16] <hugo_moss> this channel needs you
[22:22:20] <hugo_moss> ok hehe
[22:22:22] <hugo_moss> goodnight
[22:22:39] <hugo_moss> merry christmas
[22:22:59] <hugo_moss> it looks like youve been good this year!
[22:34:23] <DarkGhost> http://devcollective.net/obie is there a plugin for an img slideshow but for text? http://devcollective.net/obie the very bottom with the blue arrows.. or is there a better method?
[22:51:26] <lonejack> I'm here to ask your advice on how best to realize my application from a conceptual point of view.
[22:51:26] <lonejack> I made a series of functions that modify the DOM and sometimes, depending on the events that occur, are made new changes to the DOM and associated new events.
[22:51:26] <lonejack> At this point, I would like to create a BUTTON that when pressed goes to "remove" in the opposite way the castle created. The problem is that to do this we must somehow trace back all the steps carried out. There are many methods to achieve this but I ask you, have you any advice?
[22:51:26] <lonejack> Use the method queue?
[22:52:37] <lonejack> thank you
[23:22:02] <maxsong1002> Merry Christmas all! I have a question!
[23:22:11] <DarkGhost> merry xmas
