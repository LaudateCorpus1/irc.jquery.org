[01:14:53] <HowardwLo> hi everyone! Im not sure what i’m doing wrong here https://dpaste.de/2BFg console.log(data) comes out to be Object{content: “foobar”}, but I can’t seem to get the console.log(info.content) to say “foobar”
[01:22:33] <arc_> HowardwLo well i can't test because it's a paste instead of a fiddle, but shouldn't it be data[content]
[01:22:55] <arc_> or info[content] whatever
[01:23:26] <HowardwLo> arc_: you are right, i didn’t need the jsonparse. data.content did the trick
[01:23:46] <arc_> oh, so the server response is already json. ok
[01:23:55] <HowardwLo> arc_: ah that makes sense
[01:24:08] <HowardwLo> i guess before it was in string
[01:24:41] <HowardwLo> hm, how do iget status code of a response?
[01:24:44] <HowardwLo> data.status?

[04:56:22] <Gridsurf> a plugin is using function Plugin(el, opts) ... and within it it's extending so that this.s = $.extend({}, defaut, opts). Can I somehow outside the scope of the plugin affect this.s with an object of my own defaults?
[04:59:51] <shoky_> Gridsurf: depends where that object is. many plugins store an instance of their plugin object via .data() on the elements.. you can try seeing if that's the case here.  e.g. var inst = $('#myelem').data('myplugin');  inst.s
[05:00:41] <shoky_> Gridsurf: but why not just always set your default options when initializing the plugin?  you can use $.extend yourself for that
[05:02:15] <Gridsurf> thanks

[05:29:56] <nicofrand_cozy> Hi, I wanted to know if this is normal that jQuery 3beta returns null when calling outerHeight() on an empty jQuery object (selector returned nothing) whereas jQuery 2.2.0 returns undefined ?
[05:30:39] <nicofrand_cozy> (I saw that with an error in my code where I was doing "10 - obj.outerHeight()" ("10 - null" returns 10 whereas "10 - undefined" returns NaN)
[05:35:43] <DirtyFinn> nicofrand_cozy, null is easier to handle than 'undefined'. null is universal 'undefined' is just... I never liked that. I'ts great they're changing that in newer versions :)
[05:37:12] <DirtyFinn> if(thingy == null) is easier than if(thingy === undefined || thingy == "")
[05:37:14] <nicofrand_cozy> DirtyFinn I do not mind, but I can't find anywhere (http://blog.jquery.com/2016/01/14/jquery-3-0-beta-released/) saying that this change is wanted ?
[05:37:42] <nicofrand_cozy> hum
[05:38:15] <nicofrand_cozy> Actually jQuery3beta returns undefined whereas jQuery2 returns null DirtyFinn
[05:38:17] <DirtyFinn> maybe the writer forgot :)
[05:38:22] <nicofrand_cozy> sorry for the mistake
[05:38:29] <shoky_> nicofrand_cozy: yes it's normal, https://github.com/dmethvin/jquery/commit/c5f46c0731a407c81b32f3f7adf35846ee997cf9  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2319  https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2134
[05:38:50] <nicofrand_cozy> shoky_ thanks !
[05:38:52] <DirtyFinn> I want null!
[05:39:07] <DirtyFinn> Mom, jQuery is being mean!
[05:39:13] <DirtyFinn> :)
[05:47:51] <Dayshine> Are there any existing plugins for "Track changes" style modification of text form fields? I.e. showing addition/deletion compared to initial text

[06:23:15] <Teaboy> anyone got a good suggestion for cancelling a deferred chain? i.e. I want to handle restarting an animation on window resize
[06:28:36] <DirtyFinn> Teaboy, $(window).on('resize', function(){ //Do stuff }); would do stuff on resize. That what you meant?
[06:34:03] <Teaboy> no
[06:34:14] <Teaboy> I have a deferred object
[06:34:35] <Teaboy> https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[06:34:43] <Teaboy> calling reject() doesn't fire fail()
[06:43:51] <hellyeah> hey
[06:43:58] <hellyeah> taplar: wellcome
[06:44:05] <hellyeah> how is your vocation?
[06:59:06] <kostodo> how can i test IF a string only contains numeric chars 0-9?
[07:00:46] <DirtyFinn> if(isNumeric(val)) true: only numbers, false: contains at least one non-number
[07:01:09] <DirtyFinn> oh wait
[07:01:23] <hellyeah> javascript has .contain
[07:01:26] <hellyeah> ?
[07:01:43] <niko> isNaN(parseInt(str,10))
[07:01:43] <hellyeah> kostodo: you can write regex expression for that
[07:01:54] <hellyeah> probably regex has some method for that
[07:02:01] <hellyeah> that can work
[07:02:05] <Teaboy> I ended up with this in every then(): if (_this.cancelChain) { return $.Deferred().reject(); }
[07:02:08] <Teaboy> horrible but works
[07:02:53] <DirtyFinn> here's the missing isNumeric() method :) function isNumeric(n) {return !isNaN(parseFloat(n)) && isFinite(n);}
[07:12:02] <hellyeah> need someone who knows jquery datapicker?
[07:25:21] <Xatenev> DirtyFinn: jquery has $.isNumeric
[07:26:00] <DirtyFinn> yes
[07:26:55] <hellyeah> i changed line 71 now i cannot select a date in input box "from"?
[07:26:55] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/rrothkw6/6/
[07:36:43] <kostodo> hellyeah, how to do it with regex? i.e. 0-9 only
[07:37:00] <hellyeah> well i dont know for javascriot
[07:37:10] <hellyeah> it must be something like [0-9]*
[07:37:20] <hellyeah> or [0-9]+
[07:37:31] <hellyeah> first you need to build regex
[07:37:44] <hellyeah> i suggest you to join #regex
[07:38:31] <kostodo> ok if i have the regex, then what?
[07:38:37] <Xatenev> kostodo: you dont need regex for a simple thing as that
[07:38:44] <kostodo> str.match == num?
[07:38:50] <Xatenev> kostodo: Always choose the easiest solution, thats not regex in your case.
[07:38:50] <kostodo> == null i mean
[07:39:01] <kostodo> Xatenev, what is the easier solution?
[07:39:08] <Xatenev> we told you before, no?
[07:39:50] <DirtyFinn> if(isNumeric(val))     true: only numbers, false: contains at least one non-number
[07:40:03] <kostodo> isnumeric allows negative numbers
[07:40:14] <DirtyFinn> if($.isNumeric(val))     true: only numbers, false: contains at least one non-number
[07:40:23] <kostodo> amongst other things
[07:40:26] <DirtyFinn> of course i fucked it up again :)
[07:40:53] <kostodo> also there are issues with length of string
[07:40:55] <kostodo> its a string
[07:40:59] <kostodo> i want to check its characters
[07:41:04] <kostodo> to ensure they only contain 0-9
[07:41:17] <kostodo> Xatenev, do you still maintain that isNumeric is my solution here?
[07:41:22] <DirtyFinn> so if you want only positive numbers checked of something    if($.isNumeric(val) && val >= 0)
[07:41:44] <Xatenev> kostodo: depends, whats with float numbers?
[07:41:47] <Xatenev> kostodo: 1.5
[07:41:51] <Xatenev> kostodo: true or false?
[07:41:56] <kostodo> false
[07:42:06] <hellyeah> kostodo: ===
[07:42:09] <kostodo> like i said im validating a input type=text
[07:42:09] <hellyeah> use this
[07:42:12] <DirtyFinn> if val is a string val.length returns the strings length
[07:42:27] <hellyeah> to avoid type coercion
[07:43:36] <kostodo> so do we agree that isNumeric is not right in my instance?
[07:43:59] <hellyeah> kostodo: you should try to code in jsfiddle
[07:44:08] <hellyeah> people can help you better
[07:44:11] <Xatenev> if($.isNumeric(val) && val >= 0 && val === parseInt(val,10)) { }
[07:44:15] <Xatenev> @kostodo
[07:44:24] <Xatenev> should work for all your cases
[07:44:26] <kostodo> how is that easier than a regex match?
[07:44:41] <Xatenev> way easier to read for me atleast.
[07:45:47] <Xatenev> kostodo: otherwise it will be something like /^\+?[0-9]\d$/.test(val);
[07:45:47] <kostodo> id prefer to use .match
[07:45:54] <Xatenev> kostodo: thats just out of my mind. not sure if it is 100% correct
[07:46:07] <kostodo> im not worried about the regex
[07:46:10] <DirtyFinn> regex should always the last way. because you can fuck it up so easily
[07:46:12] <kostodo> more to what js to use
[07:46:21] <kostodo> .match?
[07:46:22] <kostodo> .test?
[07:47:55] <Xatenev> kostodo: .test
[07:47:59] <Xatenev> kostodo: for yoru case
[07:48:10] <kostodo> thanks
[07:48:10] <Xatenev> kostodo: test returns true/false .match returns the matches or null
[07:58:47] <JD-Robbs> Hi all, would anyone know how, in a click event, I can find out what the initial mousedown(ed)-element was? I am trying to make a distinction between a pure click and a selection that started in a different element. Thanks for any ideas! :)
[08:04:19] <Cork> JD-Robbs: click isn't cross browser when it comes to that
[08:04:44] <Cork> JD-Robbs: the best option is to listen for mousedown and mouseup
[08:04:53] <Cork> and store what element was the mousedown
[08:05:03] <JD-Robbs> Oh okidoki, and then a timeout?
[08:05:15] <JD-Robbs> I.e. 100ms between down/up --> it's a click.
[08:05:17] <Cork> why timeout?
[08:05:21] <Cork> ah
[08:05:28] <Cork> eh...
[08:05:39] <JD-Robbs> (if both occured in the same DOM element)
[08:05:44] <Cork> best option might be to use mousedown and click
[08:06:18] <Cork> though you would have to test this on the different engines
[08:06:36] <Cork> as i'm not sure it will work reliably cross browsers
[08:06:51] <JD-Robbs> Ah true: mousedown --> store some variable in the DOM element. click --> check if the variable exists. If not, the click was "dragged" from somewhere else. I'll try that. Thanks!
[08:07:33] <Bilel_mk> hello everyone can someone help wen i put my script ajax and my script jquery in a same the same page .js script ajax does not work  but wen i put every one  alone it work???   http://pastebin.com/9pE9KPr9

[08:14:13] <DirtyFinn> in  (function($) {   you could call  startTime  and it would run
[08:14:41] <Bilel_mk> okay
[08:15:28] <DirtyFinn> the problem with your code is that function($) runs when page is loaded but the startTime just hangs out and no one asks it to play with them

[11:37:17] <geoid> hi all
[11:38:27] <geoid> I'm working with bootstrap 3 and seeing this javasript usage: which I don't understand: http://pastebin.com/tNWMr0T1
[11:38:48] <geoid> specifically line 4
[11:39:09] <geoid> jquery usage I mean
[11:39:45] <geoid> I don't get what the combination of $ and (this) results in.
[11:40:01] <geoid> What class it will be.
[11:41:45] <shoky_> geoid: inside a jquery event handler, `this` is the element the event was triggered on. so it will be the clicked <a> in this case
[11:42:10] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/vyb7fz12/1/ why does this not update the value of the field above in fiddle?  However I also have this code within my page and if I edit the bottom field the top field does get updated, however if I try to submit this since its on a form the new updated value is not used and the original value is submitted.  thanks in advanced
[11:42:24] <shoky_> and it's not a combination of $ and (this),  it's calling the function called $  and passing `this` as an argument
[11:43:49] <geoid> shoky_ thx for the clarification, I never really thought about it that way before... tho it seems obvious now.
[11:46:20] <shoky_> DexDeadly: you didn't include jquery, and you never call that `riskWin` function
[11:52:14] <DexDeadly> riskWin is called in the page itself as well as jquery I'm guessing not the fiddle but I thought that was included using jsfiddle
[11:53:13] <shoky_> not automatically, no. you can click on where it says JAVASCRIPT and choose jquery there
[11:55:41] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/vyb7fz12/3/ I see ok so I did that and its updating so it works like my site however if I change the value it still is not updating on my page so its still submitting the old value that was in the field from the prior form submission
[11:56:16] <jqueryHelp> Hey everyone
[11:57:08] <duch_kazatel> hello
[11:57:43] <jqueryHelp> Was wondering if someone could take a look at a problem I have
[11:57:50] <jqueryHelp> If you wouldn't mind :)
[11:57:57] <shoky_> DexDeadly we can't know what's gonig on in your page without seeing your code..
[11:58:00] <duch_kazatel> jqueryHelp if you have a question, just ask.
[11:58:04] <duch_kazatel> if somebody can help, they will.
[11:58:33] <jqueryHelp> I guess my problem is how to word it without pasting a huge paragraph.. lol
[11:58:47] <duch_kazatel> jqueryHelp do you have a test case you can share?
[11:58:53] <jqueryHelp> Yes I do
[11:58:58] <jqueryHelp> I built a slider for our product tour, it has 3 ways to navigate, your arrow keys, the arrow buttons, and a timeline. Right now, I have it working so you can forward and back using both buttons / arrow keys and you can even jump using the timeline.
[11:59:08] <jqueryHelp> Here’s where it goes wrong, If I use the arrow keys and go to slide 2, then jump to 5 with the timeline, and then go up 1 with an arrow key, I only reach slide 3 (because it’s indexed via the buttons) instead of slide 6. But not only does it not want to work, if I jump with the time line and hit the previous arrow, I get brought back 2 pages, instead of just 1. If I do the same with the next arrow, it blanks out the tour and 
[11:59:27] <duch_kazatel> jqueryHelp that cut off.
[11:59:30] <jqueryHelp> I have a live page here: https://preview.hs-sites.com/_hcms/preview/template/multi?template_layout_id=3772987986&is_buffered_template_layout=true&portalId=667248&tc_deviceCategory=DESKTOP#target-5
[11:59:50] <duch_kazatel> sounds like you're keeping track of things using a strange state management syste,.
[12:00:20] <duch_kazatel> mind making a jsfiddle?
[12:00:27] <jqueryHelp> yes, it is on a dev server using HubSpot COS, but it works the same as having separate files
[12:00:52] <jqueryHelp> I can, but since it uses a framework, it won't be very helpful. I can do it show you pretty printed code however
[12:01:44] <jqueryHelp> This JS fiddle has the jquery code: https://jsfiddle.net/o61twagh/
[12:02:26] <DexDeadly> shoky_ what would you like to
[12:02:28] <DexDeadly> see
[12:03:22] <shoky_> DexDeadly the relevant code and html.. you say you're submitting a form. i don't see any form, or any form submission, or any <input>s with names
[12:04:55] <DexDeadly> I have a page where they put in a value and then submit form which brings up this page.  I then fill in the value using <?php echo $_POST['aml'][$i]; ?> because on this page they have the ability to change the value if they want.  however eve though the jQuery changes the text in the box however the value remains the initial value
[12:06:04] <duch_kazatel> jqueryHelp so i'm wondering why you hand-rolled your own carousel instead of using one of the hundreds out there.
[12:06:33] <jqueryHelp> Because the framework has to use special modules, unfortunately
[12:06:35] <NoiseEee> you want to update something on the page in real-time when the value of a form input changes?
[12:06:44] <NoiseEee> DexDeadly: ^^
[12:07:09] <jqueryHelp> duch_kazatel, think of it like a drag and drop version of bootstrap
[12:07:17] <duch_kazatel> jqueryHelp that doesn't change anything.
[12:07:19] <duch_kazatel> but oaky.
[12:08:25] <DexDeadly> Here is the initial form. http://pastebin.com/08F7NzsZ here is the page where they can change the values before submitting. http://pastebin.com/0M2AzbAA
[12:08:26] <duch_kazatel> this isn't going to fix anything, but $($(".tour-panel")[current]) don't do this.  use eq.
[12:09:04] <jqueryHelp> eq?
[12:09:13] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/eq/
[12:09:14] <duch_kazatel> :)
[12:10:00] <duch_kazatel> either way, i'm not really sure where to help since this is kind of a big issue.  hopefully somebody else will come along and be able to take the time though :)
[12:10:09] <jqueryHelp> $(".tour-panel").eq()[current] ?
[12:10:13] <duch_kazatel> no.
[12:10:15] <duch_kazatel> read the docs :)
[12:10:19] <duch_kazatel> .eq(current)
[12:10:43] <jqueryHelp> Oh so it replaces []?
[12:11:00] <duch_kazatel> woops
[12:11:35] <jqueryHelp> Oh so it replaces []?
[12:11:49] <duch_kazatel> and makes it so you don't need to pass the whole thing back through $()
[12:12:06] <jqueryHelp> Ah I see, I'll swap that out on them all
[12:12:43] <duch_kazatel> also: fixingthesejquery.com is a great debugging guide that'll help you learn how to troubleshoot and debug things yourself :)
[12:12:47] <duch_kazatel> it's a great resource for beginners.
[12:28:52] <DexDeadly> did that help ?
[12:29:03] <DexDeadly> or to much, I know its not the cleanest of codes
[12:54:52] <duch_kazatel> weeee.
[12:56:40] <DexDeadly> lol
[13:01:58] <NoiseEee> DexDeadly: far too much code to even consider help really
[13:02:09] <NoiseEee> DexDeadly: whats your issue, in plain english
[13:10:21] <DexDeadly> Basically the values submit from one page to another but on the 2nd page they can change the value and depending which field you fill in it runs a calculation and updates the other field.  This works, however when I submit this page the original value of the field is submitted and not the updated value that is in the field
[13:10:35] <DexDeadly> the value="" tag never actually updates
[13:18:26] <DexDeadly> that make sense
[13:23:04] <duch_kazatel> how are you updating the fields?
[13:24:32] <NoiseEee> is this even a javascript issue?
[13:24:50] <NoiseEee> and what duch_kazatel says, how are the fields updating? ajax?
[13:25:04] <NoiseEee> by the "value of the tag", are you looking at the page source or something?
[13:25:13] <NoiseEee> try to make a small reproducable example
[13:25:48] <duch_kazatel> *small* being the key in that sentence.
[13:30:47] <DexDeadly> https://jsfiddle.net/vyb7fz12/3/ heres the code and you can even see within the fiddle if you inspect the element the value="" tag will have the original value from within the HTML section, so when I submit this again in a new form I dont get the correct value
[13:31:32] <duch_kazatel> don't use .bind() btw.
[13:31:34] <duch_kazatel> use .on()
[13:31:52] <duch_kazatel> also, you can't do var value more than once.
[13:37:19] <shoky_> DexDeadly: "in a new form" ?  the value="" that you see on the tag in the inspector is not showing the real runtime value. it's showing the attribute which is just the initial value. a form submit will use the real value from the .value property
[13:43:42] <jqueryHelp> Hey guys, what's goin on?
[13:43:48] <duch_kazatel> hello
[13:44:02] <jqueryHelp> Hey duch, just checking back to see if there is any new people
[13:44:10] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[13:44:23] <jqueryHelp> I was in here earlier, I'm the guy with the slider
[13:44:30] <duch_kazatel> ah.
[13:44:41] <duch_kazatel> did any of my resources help?
[13:45:01] <duch_kazatel> your problem has kind of a big scope and the lack of a functioning fiddle was kind of a hinderance fwiw.
[13:46:14] <jqueryHelp> I tossed my question up on reddit as well to try and explain it better
[13:46:44] <jqueryHelp> I totally understand, I think it has something to do with how its using split() on the index
[13:47:10] <duch_kazatel> have you tried using console logs to confirm those values are right/wrong?
[13:49:06] <DexDeadly> it doesn't though
[13:49:23] <DexDeadly> i would expect when submitting the form it would pull the new value but when I get to the new page it doesn't
[13:49:57] <shoky_> then you're doing something wrong. but we're not gonna look at your php :)
[13:50:05] <jqueryHelp> What do you mean @duch?
[13:50:16] <duch_kazatel> jqueryHelp are you familiar with console.log()?
[13:50:41] <DexDeadly> understood I didn't know if it was jquery not updating or php
[13:50:58] <duch_kazatel> DexDeadly how are you trying to update the php?
[13:51:10] <duch_kazatel> are you sending those values back to the server somehow between pageloads?
[13:51:37] <DexDeadly> no, I submit it to the next page and generate
[13:51:43] <duch_kazatel> "submit it" how?
[13:53:02] <DexDeadly> a button
[13:53:03] <DexDeadly> lol sorry
[13:53:07] <DexDeadly> im losing my mind here
[13:53:07] <duch_kazatel> erm.
[13:53:14] <duch_kazatel> is there a form or ajax or something at play?
[13:53:14] <jqueryHelp> Yes I am, I only use it to test and see if a function is being called
[13:53:18] <DexDeadly> I have a submit all button that is sending multiple arrays
[13:53:29] <DexDeadly> through a form post
[13:54:20] <shoky_> DexDeadly: you can look at the post in your browser's devtools network tab, and see exactly what values are being sent in the request
[13:55:44] <jqueryHelp> @duch, I managed to build you a basic fiddle as well
[13:55:47] <jqueryHelp> https://jsfiddle.net/gjyswrr9/
[13:56:06] <duch_kazatel> so the console log.
[13:56:23] <DexDeadly> hmmmm
[13:57:04] <DexDeadly> so I thought I looked at the network tab but i dont see any post values
[14:07:41] <DexDeadly> ok just looked again its still posting that original value but I'm going to try something because I kept the same array names between the pages so I don't know if its causing an issue
[14:07:50] <DexDeadly> gonna add a number and see if this changes anything
[14:10:59] <DexDeadly> thanks for the help guys
[14:14:40] <AlexRussia> Hello! If I use .clone(): a) an 'id' attribute copied too? b) does `deep copy` copy handlers code or just attach them(reference to a funciton) for cloned elements from original?
[14:14:56] <AlexRussia> function*
[14:15:14] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/clone/
[14:15:37] <duch_kazatel> so yes, and not sure.
[14:15:57] <duch_kazatel> probably just copies the binding, not the function iutself.
[14:16:08] <duch_kazatel> though i'd use delegation so you're not worried about that part instead.
[14:17:12] <AlexRussia> duch_kazatel: delegation?
[14:17:44] <duch_kazatel> bind your listener to a parent element that doesn't change.
[14:17:49] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[14:18:24] <duch_kazatel> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[14:18:52] <duch_kazatel> also: you can't repeat an ID on the same page - you can only use it once
[14:19:22] <AlexRussia> duch_kazatel: just see, I looking for a bit detach html(probably, layout, most) from js. So I just wanna write a block of 'template-like' elements and then modify it where I need. just care that the id repeating will not happens and handlers code in browser memory will not blow)
[14:19:34] <AlexRussia> duch_kazatel: thanks for links and response!
[14:20:25] <duch_kazatel> then you want a templating engine.
[14:20:30] <duch_kazatel> something jquery is not very good at.
[14:21:04] <AlexRussia> duch_kazatel: oh, which may you recommend for client side?
[14:21:12] <AlexRussia> duch_kazatel: (template engines)
[14:21:45] <duch_kazatel> there are dozens of choices.  if you're already using underscore, it includes a decent one.
[14:22:18] <AlexRussia> duch_kazatel: but what if I want something light....
[14:22:24] <AlexRussia> lite*
[14:22:33] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[14:22:44] <duch_kazatel> then look for something "light".
[14:22:53] <AlexRussia> duch_kazatel: okay :)
[14:23:28] <duch_kazatel> underscore is a common lib so i wasn't sure if you already had it included or not.  lots of choices out there, but don't use jquery to handle that job.  you'll wind up banging your head agaiunst the wall a lot.
[14:51:38] <ABM_Dan> Hey, I have an odd situation, I have an element that on click has to display the next element or the one after it.
[14:52:00] <ABM_Dan> I thought that .nextUntil was the function I wanted, but it's selecting exactly the opposite of what I need.
[14:52:06] <ABM_Dan> Is there an elegant way to do it?
[14:52:15] <duch_kazatel> what's the differentiation between the two?
[14:52:29] <duch_kazatel> like, why one over the other?
[14:53:58] <ABM_Dan> The clicked element is the header of a box of options, then there is a container with selected options (must always be visible), and then a container with options that haven't been selected (could be there, could be missing), this last container is the one I want to toggle the visibility of.
[14:54:51] <duch_kazatel> any reason you could structure your markup and use classes to handle this instead?
[14:54:55] <ABM_Dan> If I could reorder the source it would be trivial, .next(emptyOptionsBoxSelector) and I'm done.
[14:55:06] <duch_kazatel> otherwise, you're kind of stuck using .next() or .index()
[14:55:30] <ABM_Dan> I can use classes, but I can't match explicitly the header and the target.
[14:55:32] <duch_kazatel> well, .index() with .eq() and some other match.
[14:55:57] <duch_kazatel> i'd have to see an example of the markup then because there's something i'm not grokking.
[14:56:04] <ABM_Dan> gimme a sec.
[14:57:48] <quangl> when i oil going to be 1 dollar a gallon?
[14:57:51] <arc_> it seems like jquery makes people want to solve everything with selectors and piping, when sometimes a simple if then else statement would suffice and be much easier to figure out
[14:58:10] <duch_kazatel> quangl wrong channel
[14:58:12] <ABM_Dan> https://jsfiddle.net/1ovfgqfq/
[14:58:32] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan interesting markup.
[14:58:37] <ABM_Dan> Actually, 4 should be on top, so it can break things.
[14:58:50] <ABM_Dan> https://jsfiddle.net/1ovfgqfq/1/
[14:59:22] <duch_kazatel> i'm more confused ahaha.  so you want to toggle the "next toggleable"?
[14:59:39] <ABM_Dan> Kinda.
[14:59:48] <ABM_Dan> if I click on option 1, nothing should happen.
[15:00:05] <duch_kazatel> out of curiousity, where'd you get this markup from?
[15:00:18] <duch_kazatel> because this'd be a lot easier if it were restructured a little.
[15:00:19] <ABM_Dan> You don't want to meet my frontend guy.
[15:00:25] <ABM_Dan> yeah right?
[15:00:35] <ABM_Dan> one wrapper around the whole option and it's gg.
[15:00:55] <duch_kazatel> sort of, yeah.
[15:01:00] <duch_kazatel> why isn't he the one coding this?
[15:01:13] <duch_kazatel> anyway.
[15:01:18] <duch_kazatel> you're in for a helluva time.
[15:01:31] <ABM_Dan> Man, I could tell you, and it's actually interesting, but it means badmouting the hand that feeds.
[15:01:50] <ABM_Dan> *mouthing
[15:02:00] <arc_> i would definitely use an if statement here rather than trying to get it done all on one line
[15:02:06] <duch_kazatel> either way, you're going to have to do a series of .next() calls and checking the element to see if it matches certain criteria.
[15:02:34] <duch_kazatel> you're not going to come up with anything readable otherwisde.
[15:02:37] <duch_kazatel> *otherwise
[15:02:40] <arc_> does jquery have something like .iif()
[15:02:46] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[15:02:55] <duch_kazatel> it has .not and .is
[15:03:01] <arc_> it's an inline if that returns something
[15:03:11] <duch_kazatel> but that's not really going to give you what you want here.
[15:03:23] <arc_> i know, sorry, not relevant to this question
[15:03:26] <arc_> just something that came up in my mind
[15:03:28] <duch_kazatel> nah it's all good.
[15:03:39] <ABM_Dan> screw this, gonna add a bland div around stuff.
[15:03:47] <duch_kazatel> ABM_Dan be careful with that.
[15:03:54] <duch_kazatel> you can't just arbitrarily add divs to ULs.
[15:04:03] <ABM_Dan> It's not really a UL
[15:04:09] <duch_kazatel> then what is it?
[15:04:17] <ABM_Dan> I just like semantic markup, and seeing this stuff, I miss it.
[15:04:21] <ABM_Dan> Divs.
[15:04:57] <duch_kazatel> not sure what that has to do with this, but OK :)
[15:05:34] <ABM_Dan> When you see your 50th list marked up with divs, you start craving ULs.
[15:06:01] <duch_kazatel> err.  i'm lost about why you'd use a code example that isn't really indicative of your real markup, but OK :)
[15:06:21] <duch_kazatel> then yeah, i'd just add some containers around thigns to make this easier on yourself.
[15:06:37] <ABM_Dan> Thing is, I am not supposed to add those containers.
[15:06:48] <duch_kazatel> if they're not presentational, why would it matter?
[15:07:02] <duch_kazatel> you could always show the difference in code and show how much clearer it is with the containers.
[15:07:06] <ABM_Dan> Bitches be cray.
[15:07:25] <ABM_Dan> I'm of course talking about dogs of female gender.
[15:07:33] <duch_kazatel> that's really not that funny, but ok ;)
[15:08:04] <duch_kazatel> anyway, yeah, i'd just demonstrate the difference and see if that sways them.
[15:08:25] <ABM_Dan> Less about funny and more about realizing the strict language policy of this channel.
[15:08:47] <ABM_Dan> Gonna try to push this with some decent code comment and hope the pull request goes through.
[15:09:15] <duch_kazatel> it's not necessarily a strict language policy, just a good thing to be inclusive and do our best to that end :)
[15:10:18] <ABM_Dan> Indeed.
[15:10:30] <ABM_Dan> But no undo on irc.
[15:16:21] <ABM_Dan> This is slightly tangential, but on the subject of no wrappers, that is exactly why I find DL to be infuriating.
[15:17:43] <arc_> what is dl
[15:17:57] <ABM_Dan> definiton list
[15:18:09] <arc_> never heard of it
[15:18:35] <ABM_Dan> <dl><dt>Definition list</dt><dd>List of terms with their definitions</dd></dl>
[15:18:39] <arc_> seems useful
[15:18:44] <ABM_Dan> They are interesting and flexible
[15:19:02] <ABM_Dan> specially 'cause you can have multiple dd for each dt and so on.
[15:19:29] <ABM_Dan> but the lack of a wrapping mechanism of "conglomerate" definition makes them hard to work with.
[15:19:52] <ABM_Dan> Example: <dl><di><dt>Definition list</dt><dd>List of terms with their definitions</dd></di></dl>
[15:19:58] <ABM_Dan> (di as definition item)
[15:35:38] <VectorX> hi can someone tell me how i can make this go in the same direction to the right instead of going back at the end ? http://flexslider.woothemes.com/basic-carousel.html
[15:37:59] <arc_> i hate to be the guy who tells you not to do what you're trying to do, but the animation that goes back to the beginning is an indication that the gallery has ended. if it just keeps going, people may be confused about whether they have seen everything or not
[15:39:35] <arc_> however, it would be easier to find out what you need by reading the documentation here https://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/
[15:39:40] <arc_> instead of just going by these limited examples
[15:40:26] <arc_> i believe "animationLoop" is the option you're looking for
[15:42:47] <sdwrage> Hey all. I have a table that needs to be responsive but has form fields within most of the cells. Is there a decent plugin that would help facilitate this and still retain the values in the form fields after resizing big to small to big?
[15:43:15] <VectorX> arc_ that wasnt doing it
[15:43:37] <arc_> okay. well they may not have included that as an option at all
[15:43:50] <arc_> animationLoop true Boolean Gives the slider a seamless infinite loop.
[15:43:55] <arc_> this SOUNDS like it does what you were saying
[15:44:09] <arc_> i have definitely experienced those plugins not behaving as they say they will, for various reasons
[15:44:29] <ABM_Dan> that is why I like verbs. isLoopingAnimation()
[15:44:35] <VectorX> arc_ found it, customDirectionNav
[15:45:37] <ABM_Dan> nvm misunderstood.
[15:45:42] <decx> the loop is default in flexslider
[15:51:36] <Synthead> you know how $.ajax can encode GET params?  is there a way to just encode the URL for said params?
[15:52:01] <deepy> What do you mean by encode?
[15:52:50] <Synthead> like this (pseudocode): $.encodeParams("/that_location", {user: "me", color: "red"}) would return "/that_location?user=me&color=red
[15:53:03] <deepy> Ah, just add them to 'data'
[15:53:13] <Synthead> deepy: what?
[15:53:27] <Synthead> deepy: I'm not using $.ajax
[15:53:39] <Synthead> deepy: I'm not making an ajax request either, just trying to encode a urrl
[15:53:41] <Synthead> url
[15:54:47] <Synthead> deepy: you know what?  I think I found something: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.param/
[16:00:09] <Uhkis> Synthead: serialize/serializearray
[16:13:20] <sdwrage> is there a good way to make a table cell move below all the other cells without actually moving it into a new tr with jQuery?
[16:15:06] <decx> that would be css
[16:24:11] <sdwrage> decx, apparently its not possible with just css
[16:29:29] <NoiseEee> sdwrage: part of the problem is likely using tables for layout / not for tabular data
[16:29:35] <NoiseEee> consider a markup change
[16:29:46] <sdwrage> NoiseEee, I am using it for tabular data
[16:30:13] <sdwrage> I haven't used tables for design in over... 18 years lol
[16:31:04] <sdwrage> I guess I am just going to have to tell the designer I will have to put it on a new row if he wants it in the table like that.
[16:32:18] <arc_> what you're asking for is definitely possible
[16:32:24] <decx> elaborate on the "like that" and we'll exit vague highway
[16:33:00] <arc_> when you say "below" all the other cells it sounds like you're talking about rows, not columns, but maybe you're talking about in the markup
[16:33:53] <arc_> or maybe you're talking about something really weird like making a table cell appear below the row it actually exists in
[16:34:12] <arc_> on its own row visually but not in the markup
[16:34:56] <decx> like a fixed bottom?
[16:36:43] <sdwrage> decx, so we are using table for grading student submissions. The first few cells have radio buttons for their efficiency, then there is another cell for grade and another for comment. The comment needs to go below the other cells and span the entire length of all the other cells
[16:37:01] <sdwrage> now, I'm sure I'm going to have to just have another tr with a colspan of 4.
[16:37:24] <sdwrage> but I thought id see if there was a way to do it without actually moving it to a new row.
[16:39:01] <arc_> i see why you're doing it like that. it would probably be better to use some kind of template
[16:39:27] <decx> i dont know man, doesnt sound that much like a table and more like a list
[16:39:45] <sdwrage> well in student view its all tabular data
[16:39:53] <sdwrage> do you think a list would be better suited for this?
[16:40:03] <decx> well it's just an interface for a list of things
[16:41:02] <sdwrage> well we do have rows with more cells for each question they answered.
[16:41:13] <sdwrage> so thats why I thought it would be more of a table of data than a list
[16:41:31] <decx> you have more info, we're just guessing
[16:43:20] <sdwrage> Right. So we can at least chalk it up to the fact that its not possible to visually move the cell without actually modifying the markup and having it on a new row
[16:43:29] <sdwrage> IF its a table.
[17:41:08] <ircBaako> hi guys. how does winHeight = $(window).height(); know the height of the element?
[17:41:17] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:41:36] <ircBaako> because its giving me section a very small height i will like to change it
[17:41:48] <duch_kazatel> your question doesn't make sense.
[17:42:11] <duch_kazatel> that will get you the height of the window.\
[17:44:39] <ircBaako> duch_kazatel which window?
[17:44:53] <duch_kazatel> ... the window
[17:45:16] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window
[17:46:04] <sdwrage> the actual window
[17:46:18] <duch_kazatel> ircBaako not sure what you mean.
[17:47:14] <sdwrage> duch_kazatel, the actual browser window
[17:47:24] <duch_kazatel> sdwrage i know.
[17:47:27] <ircBaako> in ny webpage is they is a styling
[17:47:29] <ircBaako> <section class="header-video" style="width: 1349px; height: 393.458px;">
[17:47:30] <duch_kazatel> i'm asking ircBaako to clarify their question.
[17:47:46] <duch_kazatel> ircBaako then select that element.
[17:47:55] <ircBaako> see the width and height? it is determine by this code.
[17:48:11] <duch_kazatel> that's the height of that secion.
[17:48:13] <duch_kazatel> not the window.
[17:48:36] <ircBaako> http://kopy.io/5KNqO line 44 - 45
[17:48:41] <duch_kazatel> ....
[17:48:46] <duch_kazatel> i'm not sure what about my answer isn't clkear.
[17:48:48] <duch_kazatel> *clear
[17:48:56] <sdwrage> $('.header-video').height()
[17:49:06] <ircBaako> basically i want to check that height to be 500px
[17:49:13] <sdwrage> you mean set the height?
[17:49:23] <ircBaako> sdwrage yes
[17:49:51] <ircBaako> but everytime i add the height to the  header-video css
[17:49:58] <ircBaako> it is overwritten by jquery
[17:50:18] <sdwrage> ircBaako, $('.header-video').height(500);
[17:50:28] <duch_kazatel>  settings.container is the reference.
[17:50:35] <ircBaako> so i want to know how does the line 45 in the kopi link determine the height of the section element
[17:50:46] <duch_kazatel> line 45 does not.
[17:50:50] <duch_kazatel> it's looking at the window height.
[17:51:00] <duch_kazatel> lines 48 and 49 are the ones changing the size.
[17:51:25] <duch_kazatel> line 51 is comparing the window height against the container height.
[17:59:55] <ircBaako> duch_kazatel and sdwrage thanks
[18:12:45] <sdwrage> np
[18:12:51] <duch_kazatel> definitely.
[18:29:10] <SmashingX> I would like to be able to have some text on the right top corner and left top corner of a collapsible, but I haven't beel able to do, how can that be possible? This is my code: https://jsfiddle.net/8t9zn770/
[18:29:22] <duch_kazatel> CSS.
[18:29:24] <duch_kazatel> :)
[18:29:38] <SmashingX> yeah but how
[18:29:44] <duch_kazatel> i'd check in #css.
[18:29:53] <SmashingX> I mean the text doesn't even show up
[19:36:05] <SmashingX> is it possible to have more than one collapsed item when you expand a collapsible element?
[19:59:31] <JavaLover> mannnn I got a problem
[20:00:48] <JavaLover> okay so i'm trying to organize my code a bit, i'm relying on element id for object changes, but the problem is i'm trying to combine seperate sections of my site into 1 giant section via a main controller.
[20:01:34] <JavaLover> how can I stop relying on element id for object changes? i'm so confused *sigh*
[20:02:27] <JavaLover> I guess this wouldn't be a problem, if I named my objects based on what element they belong too...hmm maybe that is key?
[20:28:31] <ircBaako> hi guys. i want to remove a class if my website is viewed on a mobile phone. how do i get jquery to detect that?
[20:57:01] <kevireilly> ircBaako: alternatively you can use css media queries
[20:57:50] <ircBaako> kevireilly they class is added on a div tag by default but i want to remove and add it depend on the screen size
[20:59:00] <kevireilly> right, guessing some of your JS logic depends on this class existing or not? otherwise, layout why (such as also common with classes), you can use media queries
[20:59:07] <kevireilly> *layout wise
[21:01:09] <ircBaako> kevireilly <ul class="nav nav-pills nav-justified">
[21:01:52] <ircBaako> i want to remove nav-justified if its been viewed on a mobile
[21:02:09] <ircBaako> and add it back if its on a desktop or tablet
[21:03:50] <ircBaako> i found this example online http://codepen.io/anon/pen/OMQpvp but if you look in the js part of it
[21:04:15] <ircBaako> the if statement depends on the pre-define text in the html
[21:10:29] <JavaLover> what would you call the js file that loads all the other js files?
[21:10:53] <JavaLover> just looking for a title here
[21:11:45] <kevireilly> require.js haha.. start, init, script, index, doesn't really matter -- up to you
[21:12:08] <JavaLover> I want something that symbolizes like "these are your controls that you need to do stuff"
[21:12:22] <JavaLover> current title jslibrary.js
[21:12:44] <kevireilly> dependencies? requirements, prerequisites, pbnj
[21:13:20] <kevireilly> ircBaako: detecting screen size is mostly recommended, such as using media queries. I think modernizr as an example allows you to detech mobile devices by checking the screen size using a media query
[21:13:31] <luvmyh0nda> Hi! In jQuery Mobile, I am trying to change the text of a div, but the only way my function fires is if I physically refresh the page. Without using data-ajax='false', is there any other way to make it fire when the page loads? I have tried wrapping in .on 'navigate', 'pagechange' and 'pageinit'. Thanks!
[21:17:04] <kevireilly> ircBaako: in the codepen you referenced, it appears that `ResponsiveBootstrapToolkit` is responsible for making some similar determination.. so if you're already using that, then I guess that is an option indeed. And the if statement isn't using something from the html I don't believe.. it is likely evaluating the screen size
[21:37:18] <ircBaako> kevireilly thanks
[21:38:29] <ircBaako> i have one last question. i have alot of ul in my one page site. how do i select 1 which has those classes "nav" and  "nav-pills"
[21:38:41] <ircBaako> i have tried $("ul, nav, nav-pills").addClass("nav-justified");
[21:38:46] <ircBaako> but no lucky
[21:38:48] <ircBaako> luck
[21:39:05] <arc_> well, you select classes by prefixing them with .
[21:41:19] <arc_> so it should be $('ul.nav.nav-pills') i believe
[21:43:33] <arc_> unless you mean ones that have the class nav OR nav-pills, in which case it would be $('ul.nav, ul.nav-pills')
[21:43:38] <ircBaako> arc_ thanks
[21:43:53] <ircBaako> i always forgot the . and #
[21:48:34] <ircBaako> arc_ what if you wanted to in into stages e.g. <div class="1"><div class="2"><div class="3></div></div></div>
[21:48:49] <ircBaako> i wanted to target class 3
[21:49:13] <ircBaako> but i know class 3 is used in other areas
[21:49:36] <luvmyh0nda> ircBaako: $('.2 .3')
[21:49:37] <ircBaako> how will i select all that partically class 3?
[21:49:45] <ircBaako> thanks luvmyh0nda
[21:49:47] <luvmyh0nda> np
[21:50:55] <luvmyh0nda> or, in your case, .1 .2 .3
[21:51:10] <luvmyh0nda> you can also add an additional class
[21:51:18] <luvmyh0nda> class='3 easyselect-3'
[22:24:15] <DexDeadly> anyone ever password protect a submit button?
[22:24:37] <luvmyh0nda> DexDeadly: you can intercept using confirm(), but other than that, there's always a way to trigger it
[22:25:31] <slide> with $(selector).each(function() { .. }); what if I return something in that function, how do I access it? the return of the $(selector) just seems to be the results of that selector
[22:26:24] <kevireilly> slide: you cant as a return is returning the result to the caller which is within jquery
[22:26:42] <kevireilly> you can redefine or manipulate a variable, object, otherwise that has been closed over though
[22:26:47] <rcyr> slide: You can't... if you want to return things at every iteration, you want .map
[22:27:03] <DexDeadly> Bring up a confirm box with the password in it
[22:27:40] <slide> hrm, how do I do chaining with my plugin, for insteance $('#foo').myPlugin().methodOfMyPluginHere();
[22:28:51] <slide> or how do I even get the instance of my plugin that was created? in my plugin function would I have to create a new array of all the newly created plugin objects and return that?
[22:29:41] <luvmyh0nda> DexDeadly: yes
[22:29:48] <luvmyh0nda> on the click of the submit, call confirm()
[22:29:52] <luvmyh0nda> and then maybe use ajax to verify?
[22:30:16] <DexDeadly> hmm
[22:32:48] <slide> hrm maybe returning this.data('myPluginName'); is whta I'm looking for
[22:48:37] <DexDeadly> i figured a way around it.  Though I just realized something I do need to check for as kind of a user check if they go back they can possibly submit more then there total balance so I need to check this info again
[22:49:21] <DexDeadly> can you serialize a form with multiple arrays?
