[00:57:21] <arjun> Hi
[00:58:46] <Guest8046> i am using jquery floatingScroll plugin, and its not working in chrome with win10. and some times in firefox
[01:01:56] <Guest8046> it works fine in chrome Version 51.0.2704.106 (64-bit) on ubuntu
[01:59:44] <daslicht> any idea whey fullscreen is not working here : http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/3yet9tvw/11/
[01:59:46] <daslicht> ?
[02:25:35] <maasha> How can I combine these selectors? I want to avoid the duplicate code: https://gist.github.com/maasha/22bfc36933cffca94719ba5e5cdd11a6
[02:31:06] <SlizardWizard> i change .on('submit') function, and i want a way to be able to tell which submit button was pressed
[02:50:13] <hellyeah> hey
[02:50:39] <bambanx> hey hellyeah
[02:50:49] <hellyeah> how goes?
[02:53:13] <hellyeah> any suggestion about my code https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/8yak04s5/ ?
[02:54:04] <systemfault> It's all glue code...
[02:54:10] <systemfault> There's isn't anything to say.
[02:54:24] <hellyeah> what does glue code mean?
[02:55:23] <systemfault> hellyeah: Glue code is when you just take a few libraries, instantiate them and add few extra lines of customization.
[02:55:41] <hellyeah> ic
[02:56:43] <hellyeah> hmm may you can state something i need to fix
[02:56:44] <hellyeah> dunno
[02:58:14] <systemfault> Ok, I'll look
[02:59:48] <systemfault> There's nothing at all to say, there's no actual code in there.
[02:59:56] <systemfault> There's no logic at all.
[03:01:09] <daslicht> :)
[03:04:22] <hellyeah> systemfault:  this is implemented in jquery ui datepicker in different way
[03:04:32] <hellyeah> i did something like windows calendare you are cruel
[03:04:52] <systemfault> Sorry for telling the truth, I'll avoid that in the future.
[03:05:09] <hellyeah> :p
[03:05:19] <hellyeah> well my manager asked me to do that
[03:05:35] <hellyeah> no offense really :D
[03:07:25] <systemfault> Fine, I do tons of glue code too
[03:07:30] <systemfault> It's part of the job.
[03:07:37] <systemfault> Can't reinvent the wheel everytime.
[03:08:45] <hellyeah> systemfault:  tbh this code is like reinvent the wheel
[03:09:50] <hellyeah> systemfault:  once my manager asked me to do that https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/8xq614zh/
[03:09:56] <systemfault> It would be reinventing the wheel if you took out jQueryUI then wrote all its code.
[03:10:00] <hellyeah> manuel scroll
[03:10:28] <systemfault> Hmm
[03:10:29] <hellyeah> what i mean is that functionality is unnecessary
[03:10:46] <hellyeah> glue code can be good for practicing anyway
[03:11:01] <systemfault> How?
[03:11:12] <hellyeah> hmm well i am not expert
[03:11:17] <hellyeah> i was the beginner
[03:11:24] <hellyeah> i wrote js, jquery like 6 months
[03:11:50] <hellyeah> anyway i dont know
[03:11:55] <systemfault> People only doing glue code is why so many "frontend programmers" are lost now that single-page applications are becoming popular but cannot learn a framework because they don't even know JavaScript
[04:20:51] <hellyeah> systemfault:  single page application you do with angular or react right
[04:21:09] <hellyeah> systemfault:  and what you meant they couldnt use angular or react because they dont know js
[04:21:13] <systemfault> These are 2 of the available frameworks to write SPAs, right.
[04:21:34] <systemfault> hellyeah: Yes. They only know how to instantiate jQuery plugins.
[04:21:55] <hellyeah> also i heard vuejs
[04:22:17] <hellyeah> systemfault:  i see i tried to learn javascript also but i have to improve myself for sure
[04:22:34] <hellyeah> codeschool has good js vids
[04:22:51] <hellyeah> let me show you my other code
[04:23:05] <systemfault> I personally had to learn from books... I couldn't find any good js vids back in the days.
[04:23:22] <hellyeah> systemfault:  eloquent?
[04:23:39] <systemfault> That's was 9 years ago...
[04:23:42] <systemfault> *That
[04:23:55] <hellyeah> so you improved js about 9 years
[04:23:56] <hellyeah> cool
[04:23:58] <systemfault> So I used "The good parts"
[04:24:12] <systemfault> I already had a C++ programming background before.
[04:25:38] <hellyeah> it is generally jquery but i really worked on it http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/m03hfqqd/ so i used some javascript as well code is kinda long if you care to look.
[04:27:32] <systemfault> Looking
[04:28:06] <hellyeah> thanks
[04:33:20] <systemfault> Some minor offenses but overall, it's not bad
[04:33:41] <systemfault> hellyeah^
[04:34:07] <hellyeah> oh i am glad
[04:34:18] <hellyeah> i wrote js/jquery 6 months
[04:34:22] <hellyeah> i am not experienced
[04:34:37] <hellyeah> can you tell me about "minor offense" i can take a note
[04:35:28] <systemfault> Look at the clone variable
[04:35:31] <systemfault> Where is it declared?
[04:35:46] <systemfault> That's one
[04:35:49] <hellyeah> let me take a look
[04:36:32] <systemfault> Then you use for(var keys in valuesAll) for an array, it's slow, it's bad, it won't necessarily iterate through all the values in order.
[04:37:01] <systemfault> Use $.each(valuesAll, function(){   or the ES5 equivalent    valuesAll.foreach(function(){
[04:37:28] <systemfault> But the worse offense is the huge amount of selector duplication
[04:37:31] <hellyeah> clone inside the function
[04:37:50] <systemfault> hellyeah: Where is it declared, what line?
[04:38:57] <hellyeah> line 141
[04:39:31] <systemfault> hellyeah: To declare a variable, you MUST use the "var" keyword, else... it becomes a global variable.
[04:39:53] <systemfault> Perhaps you wanted a , at the end of line 140 instead of a ; ?
[04:40:11] <hellyeah> ah yes
[04:40:21] <hellyeah> now i see the problem
[04:40:29] <systemfault> So, that's problem #1
[04:40:34] <hellyeah> i didnt know that so when you dont declare the variable with var
[04:40:39] <hellyeah> it become global ?
[04:40:48] <hellyeah> okey
[04:40:53] <hellyeah> i learnt one thing
[04:41:01] <systemfault> Yes, that's how JS works when not in strict mode
[04:41:01] <hellyeah> i will look at "selector duplication"
[04:41:16] <hellyeah> it is actually in strict mode
[04:41:27] <hellyeah> i did "use strict" at the top
[04:41:37] <systemfault> Ok
[04:41:48] <hellyeah> do i need to put this line inside the function as well?
[04:42:25] <systemfault> No, a single one at the top should be enough
[04:43:01] <hellyeah> i see
[04:43:11] <hellyeah> btw you meant with for loop
[04:43:24] <hellyeah> use forEach instead of for loopp right
[04:43:30] <hellyeah> or jquery version $.each
[04:43:52] <systemfault> Yes, or if you really want to use a for loop, use it with an index, never for/in
[04:45:02] <systemfault> var myArray = []; for(var k in myArray) {} is bad      for(var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) { } is fine        $.each/.forEach is best
[04:45:11] <hellyeah> well i used like that because i didnt think you can reach object index with number
[04:45:24] <systemfault> hellyeah: Object index?
[04:45:37] <hellyeah> i mean i meant wrong
[04:45:42] <hellyeah> i have an object there
[04:45:52] <hellyeah> it is like list i supposed
[04:45:55] <systemfault> hellyeah: is valuesAll an array or an object?
[04:46:06] <systemfault> Are the keys numbers or strings?
[04:46:28] <hellyeah> thats why you reach element by value not an index
[04:46:37] <hellyeah> valuesAll i thought as object
[04:46:51] <hellyeah> object that holds another objects
[04:47:01] <systemfault> If it's really an object, for/in is okay but $.each is better
[04:47:03] <hellyeah> i may create this as array
[04:47:11] <hellyeah> i see
[04:47:54] <hellyeah> is there any other thing i need to take a look
[04:48:04] <systemfault> And finally, the duplication: 159-160  222 to 225   273 to 276   300
[04:48:04] <hellyeah> systemfault:  thanks for feedback i appreciated
[04:49:25] <systemfault> var $from = $(this).closest('.datePicker').find('.from').val(); var $to = $(this).closest('.datePicker').find('.to').val(); this is bad. var $datePicker = $(this).closest('.datePicker'); var $from = $datePicker.find('.from').val(); var $to = $datePicker.find('.to').val(); this is better
[04:50:39] <hellyeah> ah
[04:50:44] <hellyeah> ic what you mean
[04:51:01] <hellyeah> okey you wont define extra variable in that way
[04:51:13] <hellyeah> thanks systemfault
[04:52:03] <hellyeah> let me take a note
[04:53:07] <systemfault> No, the opposite, define more variables to avoid useless DOM lookups
[04:53:35] <hellyeah> yeah i see
[04:53:44] <hellyeah> i am sorry i meant wrongly i understand
[04:53:46] <systemfault> 223-226 are ridiculous
[04:54:23] <systemfault> And for some reason, you're using .closest to find the <body> which doesn't make sense.
[04:55:02] <AdamPDotty> .closest('html').find('body')
[04:55:26] <systemfault> And using .attr like that .attr('disabled', false) doesn't work, use .prop
[04:55:43] <hellyeah> there i moved the top and find the last element i mean it is smt like that
[04:55:52] <hellyeah> systemfault:  let me take a note
[04:56:13] <systemfault> $(this).closest('body').find('.datePicker') is the same as $('.datePicker')
[04:56:41] <systemfault> Unless you have multiple <body> inside your page... which is impossible.
[04:56:56] <hellyeah> ic
[04:57:01] <mikatone> hi is there a simple way to select a value from a select box, or I have to capture the values and loop till I find it?
[04:57:14] <AdamPDotty> select.val();
[04:57:27] <systemfault> mikatone mySelector.val(theValueYouWant')
[04:57:47] <hellyeah> is that all?
[04:57:55] <mikatone> systemfault nice
[04:58:24] <systemfault> hellyeah: There might be more but it won't be tonight... It's 5 am right now and I'm tired.
[04:58:41] <systemfault> hellyeah: So keep up the good work, keep on learning :)
[04:58:57] <hellyeah> systemfault:
[04:59:02] <hellyeah> thank you very much
[04:59:06] <systemfault> You're welcome
[04:59:09] <hellyeah> really enjoyed it and appreciate
[04:59:17] <hellyeah> i like to code  better then the past
[04:59:28] <systemfault> Glad I could help.
[04:59:32] <systemfault> See you!
[04:59:38] <hellyeah> systemfault:  i am glad you like my code "not bad" :)
[05:11:01] <mikatone> systemfault for some reason I can't set the val() of select box...
[05:19:03] <stennowork> does jquery now have A/+ promises?
[05:23:59] <mikatone> systemfault how to choose option based on option displayed text?
[05:25:30] <mikatone> systemfault val() will select id
[05:25:47] <mikatone> but text is another thing
[05:36:50] <mikatone> anyone knows how can i loop through a select box and choose an option based on text no in val I wonder if filter function would help?
[05:39:26] <mikatone> *in = id anyways any idea?
[05:43:18] <rfc19> Hello, how can i detect which element is clicked on my page? I've tried something like this, but no luck -- https://jsfiddle.net/4j89chbj/. If I alert the variable 'target' I see 'object' as the output.
[07:07:32] <shoky> stennowork: jquery 3 does, ya
[07:07:41] <stennowork> neat, thanks
[09:10:38] <stennowork> i think i just .data sensibly
[09:10:43] <stennowork> just used*
[09:11:43] <stennowork> to prevent showing mail addresses in cleartext on the page, i create an <a>, then i bind the mail address to it with .data, and on click it reads its data and sets location.href
[09:11:59] <stennowork> does that sound sensible?
[09:12:10] <hellyeah> i store hose kind of information in data attribute
[09:12:17] <hellyeah> data-* is flexible
[09:12:28] <stennowork> yes but i don't want it to appear in the markup
[09:12:36] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:12:42] <stennowork> so you cannot scrape the page for the address
[09:12:46] <hellyeah> well
[09:12:51] <taplar> data attached with data() doesn't show up in the markup
[09:12:54] <hellyeah> you get mail address from backend
[09:13:07] <stennowork> taplar, that was the idea, yes
[09:13:10] <hellyeah> and you can add it to your element with .data() function in hs part
[09:13:29] <stennowork> yeah thats what i did
[09:13:32] <hellyeah> so it wont appear in the markup but it will appear in the dom
[09:13:43] <taplar> doesn't go to the dom either
[09:13:46] <stennowork> ok so i did it right :)
[09:13:48] <taplar> it's in js memory
[09:13:51] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am sorry to interrupt you
[09:14:01] <hellyeah> taplar:  i understand
[09:14:11] <hellyeah> stennowork:  you are good to go then :)
[09:14:37] <hellyeah> once i got json datas from backend and add each data to button seperately
[09:14:50] <hellyeah> so when i click button i will send parameters with different values
[09:14:59] <hellyeah> it should work
[09:16:37] <hellyeah> taplar:  actually i fixed what you said but the functionality didnt work :/
[09:16:46] <taplar> hmm?
[09:17:09] <hellyeah> can i show you? may be you can suggest me something.
[09:17:20] <hellyeah> it is long code if you dont want to look
[09:17:23] <hellyeah> i can understand
[09:17:38] <taplar> throw it out there.  i'm still warming up my morning, :)
[09:17:51] <hellyeah> but you dont have to look at whole code just spesific lines
[09:17:59] <hellyeah> taplar:  thanks do some stretching
[09:17:59] <hellyeah> :D
[09:18:29] <taplar> heh, i'll stick with my milk and tea
[09:18:47] <Ben_1> hi guys
[09:18:51] <hellyeah> taplar:  good choice
[09:18:56] <Ben_1> I'm using jquery for a greasemonkey script
[09:19:02] <hellyeah> taplar http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/m03hfqqd/9/ line 12-270 btw
[09:19:06] <Ben_1> my problem is that it won't work on generated html source
[09:19:19] <hellyeah> i dont know anything about that script
[09:19:41] <Ben_1> is there a way to use .next() on a not generated div to select a generated div?
[09:20:31] <jak2000> hi all
[09:21:02] <taplar> Ben_1: next() should work for all elements in the dom, regardless of how/when they were created
[09:21:04] <jak2000> with moment how to know the diff of 2 dates, if the difference is 1 hour display a message
[09:21:43] <Ben_1> mh taplar but it won't I don't know why
[09:21:57] <taplar> hellyeah: what exactly am i looking for?  12-270 is a fairly large span of code
[09:22:00] <Ben_1> next will select a totally different div and not a sibling
[09:22:13] <taplar> Ben_1: can you should in a fiddle what your trying?
[09:22:24] <Ben_1> mh private :/
[09:22:37] <Ben_1> if it is ok
[09:22:53] <taplar> i prefer public.  the room rules promote it too
[09:23:07] <taplar> we want everyone to learn, :)
[09:24:01] <stennowork> shoky, remember some days ago when i complained about how .data() works? i now used .data() successfully and sensibly!
[09:24:11] <hellyeah> taplar:  let me explain
[09:24:26] <stennowork> shoky, and used the fact that it indeed does _not_ write to the markup/DOM
[09:25:05] <hellyeah> when you click datepickers title you will get dialog with months of the year. When you click dialog title you will get the list of years. So you can go any year/any month when you click month datepicker should pop up with spesific month and year
[09:26:04] <Ben_1> taplar: ok lets imagine I have a page created with e.g. angular or something. So several html elements are generated by AngularJS. Now I want to write a greasemonkey script to change several details of that page to fit my needs. My problem is that there is a nested div structure and my greasemonkey script is just working on not generated html elements and I don't know why. (I'm using jquery for that script)
[09:27:03] <taplar> is angular creating the elements after your greasemonkey script runs?
[09:27:23] <Ben_1> I don't know it is not my page :P
[09:27:49] <taplar> afaik, greasemonkey runs once the page is loaded.  it may be that angular is creating those after page load
[09:28:01] <Ben_1> is there something like $(document).ready that is called after the initial js is executed or several seconds are gone?
[09:28:25] <taplar> on('load', ...) fires after everything is done
[09:28:36] <Ben_1> ah ok thanks
[09:28:37] <Ben_1> I will try
[09:29:25] <taplar> hellyeah: yeah i remember your fiddle.  i remember you had that issue, and i pointed out a nested binding, which was most likely not the problem, but was a problem
[09:30:21] <shoky> stennowork: awesome :)
[09:30:48] <stennowork> ^_^
[09:31:03] <stennowork> the conversation with you was really... how do you say that
[09:31:05] <stennowork> fruitful?
[09:31:06] <stennowork> D:
[09:31:16] <stennowork> it helped me understanding the whole issue
[09:31:18] <shoky> that works ;)
[09:31:19] <stennowork> thanks for that :)
[09:31:37] <shoky> glad to have helped :)
[09:34:00] <taplar> hellyeah: ln 83, what is 'currentDate' ?
[09:35:53] <Ben_1> taplar: $(window).load(function() {}); worked for me :)
[09:36:11] <taplar> awesome
[09:36:18] <Ben_1> thanks for your help
[09:36:23] <taplar> so it seems that greasemonkey runs before load, :s
[09:39:11] <hellyeah> taplar:  let me check
[09:39:47] <shoky> stennowork: just read what you wrote earlier.. just so all is crystal clear - "writing to the markup" makes no sense in the client-side (i.e. you can't even do it), only writing to the DOM makes sense. as for scraping - writing to the DOM (e.g. data attributes) wouldn't affect scrapers that just parse the html
[09:40:21] <stennowork> hmm thats right
[09:40:27] <hellyeah> taplar:  currentDate is a date i change according to my selection (month) donsnt it make sense?
[09:40:45] <taplar> yeah, i just didn't see it declared before hand
[09:40:50] <shoky> stennowork: it would only affect scrapers that actually run JS (e.g. with a headless browser like phantomjs), and for those type of scrapers, writing with .data() they'd still be able to scrape that pretty easil
[09:40:52] <shoky> y
[09:40:52] <stennowork> only if also certain javascript is executed, and scrapers don't do that
[09:40:55] <stennowork> yeah :D
[09:41:01] <hellyeah> taplar:  i set currentdate to datepickers date in that line $from.datepicker("setDate", currentDate).focus();
[09:41:03] <shoky> scrapers DO do that :)
[09:41:23] <stennowork> that seems like a demanding way to scrape pages
[09:41:37] <hellyeah> taplar:  actually it worked here perfectly https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/8yak04s5/ totally same code
[09:41:47] <shoky> it's necessary for many sites
[09:42:01] <shoky> for scraping them, that is ;p
[09:42:12] <stennowork> hmm
[09:42:23] <hellyeah> what is scraping?
[09:43:36] <hellyeah> anyways taplar do you have any suggestion for me?
[09:43:39] <shoky> hellyeah: fetching data/content from sites, basically
[09:43:41] <stennowork> reading the contents of a file basically
[09:43:51] <hellyeah> hmm
[09:43:56] <hellyeah> ic
[09:43:58] <shoky> but specific pieces of data
[09:44:10] <shoky> some of which may not be present in the initial html
[09:44:11] <hellyeah> with spesific keyword?
[09:44:11] <stennowork> but not like, with the intended program, if you can say it like that, but in order to find certain information
[09:44:42] <shoky> and well the point is that it's a program that does this automatically, not a human browsing the site ;p
[09:44:42] <stennowork> for example, yes
[09:44:50] <stennowork> right
[09:44:53] <shoky> such a program is called a scraper
[09:45:00] <taplar> i think of search engine scrapers
[09:45:18] <taplar> web crawlers
[09:45:19] <shoky> yup. google does lots of scraping
[09:45:54] <MEGAGHZ> stalkers pradise
[09:45:59] <taplar> :D
[09:46:08] <hellyeah> wat
[09:46:13] <stennowork> hellyeah, in my case its about my email address appearing in clear text on my page, so a simple get request could read out said email without even having to execute javascript, and then send spam to it
[09:46:17] <shoky> though classic web crawlers wouldn't be considered scrapers i guess, as they just get the whole bulk of data and index it, they dont extract specific info
[09:46:19] <taplar> the lesser known stevie wonders song
[09:46:28] <MEGAGHZ> lol
[09:46:32] <MEGAGHZ> cant see cant see
[09:46:42] <hellyeah> stennowork:  is that security leak?
[09:46:51] <stennowork> you can consider it one
[09:47:06] <hellyeah> some kind of XSS attack ?
[09:47:27] <stennowork> so the scraper then matche sa simple email regexp
[09:47:28] <stennowork> lol no
[09:48:21] <stennowork> its just about it being difficult to extract information (in my case email) with a simple program from my webpage
[09:48:50] <stennowork> i bet you have seen it often too, where emails on webpages are written like "foo(at)bar.com" instead of "foo@bar.com"
[09:51:14] <stennowork> and now, in order to obtain my email address from my page, a non-human needs to also execute the pages javascript, which is much much more expensive
[09:52:23] <hellyeah> taplar:  any suggestion for me :D
[09:54:26] <taplar> not right now.  work is starting
[09:54:33] <kikero> Hello!
[09:54:54] <kikero> What does `$('div' + $(this).attr('href')).show();` do?
[09:55:42] <stennowork> wut
[09:55:49] <Ben_1> (15:36:23) taplar: so it seems that greasemonkey runs before load, :s <<< yes but $(window).load(function is waiting thill the page is totally loaded
[09:55:52] <stennowork> that looks like a terrible hack
[09:56:39] <kikero> stennowork: never mind, I figured out. There was an anchor in a li and clicking on the list = clicking on the anchor which made the page redirect to the anchors href.
[09:57:03] <hellyeah> taplar:  thank you
[09:57:21] <hellyeah> taplar:  may i ask later on? may be wen can evaluate the code :)
[09:57:59] <kikero> There isn't any element there called as a div + the anchors href's value, so I have no idea why someone would do this, but it seems redundant.
[09:58:01] <taplar> sure.  but i'm not the only one here, ;)
[09:59:39] <taplar> kikero: it seems like it wouldn't work, unless they stuck a selector in the href
[10:00:02] <taplar> guess that could work.  seems weird though
[10:00:06] <stennowork> taplar, what i was thinking, <a href="#foo"> and then <div id="foo">
[10:00:36] <stennowork> being really nasty with the hash
[10:05:17] <kikero> only if that href starts with a space
[10:05:27] <kikero> otherwise, it would be <divid="foo">
[10:05:29] <kikero> :-)
[10:05:39] <stennowork> no, its a selector
[10:05:47] <stennowork> it would be "div#foo"
[10:05:48] <Ben_1> is there a way to replace a char at index i in javascript?
[10:05:59] <kikero> aaa, right
[10:06:06] <stennowork> (which would match <div id="foo">
[10:06:09] <stennowork> )
[10:08:38] <stennowork> that would be a terrible hack exploiting the fact that anchor links and css IDs use the same symbol
[10:11:23] <kikero> Ben_1: strings in JavaScript, while a primitive type, are immutable. you need to use string processing functions that return new strings and then concatenate those strings to achieve what you want.
[10:11:39] <Ben_1> ah ok thanks
[10:11:50] <kikero> Ben_1: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr
[10:14:05] <kikero> Ben_1: you should be fine with something like myString = myString.substr(0, myIndex) + myNewCharacter + myString.substr(myIndex, myString.length)
[10:27:13] <dedondesta> guys, is there a way i can programmaticaly select ermh select element (<option>) via javascript on iOS chrome
[10:27:18] <dedondesta> .val doesnt' seem to work
[10:28:14] <hellyeah> you wanna get the value of clicked element?
[10:35:30] <arif__> Is anyone here familiar with jquery autocomplete?
[10:36:03] <arif__> I want it to be such that when you hover over an autocomplete suggestion the text in the search box changes to that suggestion
[10:36:08] <arif__> how would i do that?
[10:37:59] <hellyeah> jquery ui may have something for it
[10:39:13] <dedondesta> hellyeah: i want to set a certain select value
[10:39:21] <arif__> I went through the documentation but I couldn't find the exact class for the suggestions
[10:39:33] <arif__> I tried .ui-menu-item but that doesn't work
[10:39:42] <hellyeah> dedondesta:  like placeholder?
[10:40:11] <hellyeah> when you hover textbox text will be visible as suggestion?
[10:40:26] <dedondesta> hellyeah: like if i clicked on it and selected a certain value from the drop down list
[10:41:04] <hellyeah> ah
[10:41:10] <arif__> @dedondesta i think we're looking for the same thing
[10:41:15] <hellyeah> when you select something from dropdown
[10:41:26] <hellyeah> you want to make variable of textbox?
[10:42:16] <hellyeah> dedondesta:  arif__ you can try #web also
[11:04:31] <ruffyen> so i am having some issues accessing data that I think is due to being loaded in a n iframe
[11:04:47] <ruffyen> its as if the code cant see the iframe data because the context is out of wack or something
[11:04:54] <ruffyen> is there a way to get jquery to "requery" the page?
[11:05:04] <ruffyen> after everything is loaded
[11:05:13] <ruffyen> i can get the jquery to work in the chrome console
[11:05:20] <ruffyen> but when i load it to js its just not working
[11:05:37] <ruffyen> also i know the code isnt cached because i have put in console.log messages that are unique to the test
[11:05:47] <ruffyen> and the log messages are changing
[11:21:33] <z1haze_work> I have a function that basically replaces html for a div, but there is an element on the page that i want to 'save' and then reapply after the html is replaced. Cant i just store the element in a variable like var el = $('.mydiv').html(); then replace the content of the container, then do a $('.container').append(vids) ?
[11:29:17] <taplar_afk> store it in a div after using detach() on it
[11:30:52] <z1haze_work> ah detach ok
[11:32:48] <ndee> I have something like https://jsfiddle.net/vm4oejwd/2/ and I would like to iterate over the form and get something like this: filters = {foo: 1, bla: [1,2]} Is there a function in jquery that, for a field which contains [], it get's the values as array?
[11:35:10] <z1haze_work> thanks
[11:43:57] <Yepp> is there a method that would return the input (text) produced by selectize.js? instead of finding it manually?
[11:44:34] <robertmaxrees> "the input (text)"?
[11:44:50] <robertmaxrees> you mean the value of the selected option?
[11:46:03] <Yepp> selectize.js turns select into comboboxes. It produces input type="text" so you can type for the item you are looking for and it simulate the select options by making a dropdown div
[11:46:17] <Yepp> https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js
[11:46:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm familiar with what selectize does.
[11:46:25] <Yepp> oh
[11:46:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm not clear about what you're asking :)
[11:46:58] <Yepp> would like to grab the input type="text" produced by the selectize so I can put a validator in it
[11:47:42] <Yepp> I'm currently doing it like this: $("selector).closest('div').find('.selectize-input input').first().prop('required', true).attr('data-validate', true);
[11:47:54] <Yepp> is it clear now?
[11:48:17] <robertmaxrees> you want to be able to validate the text input for selectize.
[11:48:35] <robertmaxrees> also: you want to avoid using .attr() for data attributes :) let me take a look at the docs for selectize.
[11:49:06] <Yepp> tried .data robertmaxrees but for some reason it seems not being set
[11:49:13] <robertmaxrees> .data() doesn't modify the DOM
[11:49:25] <robertmaxrees> which is good - it's much faster and safer for older browsers.
[11:49:37] <Yepp> oh
[11:49:48] <robertmaxrees> and the text input looks to be a child of the selectize-input div.
[11:50:13] <Yepp> btw here's the full issue that's why I am trying to validate it by myself: https://github.com/selectize/selectize.js/issues/1123
[11:50:35] <robertmaxrees> so $('.selectize-input input') is what you want.
[11:50:50] <Yepp> yea.
[12:27:24] <AwkwardCough> Yepp you had a golden opportunity to say "yepp" instead of "yea"
[12:28:22] <Yepp> hahaha, it would show up a notification everytime I would agree by saying yepp
[12:29:20] <AwkwardCough> haha fair enough
[12:37:38] <taplar> yepp
[12:51:10] <Yepp> http://1000hz.github.io/bootstrap-validator/#validator-fields
[12:51:16] <Yepp> Alternatively, you can add data-validate="true" / data-validate="false" to a specific input to force its inclusion / exclusion in the set of validated fields.
[12:51:23] <Yepp> does not work
[12:51:25] <Yepp> pff
[12:51:39] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle then.
[12:51:48] <robertmaxrees> fwiw: why are you adding a validator to that input?
[12:52:03] <Yepp> where? on the selectize?
[12:52:07] <Yepp> because
[12:52:07] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:52:51] <Yepp> if you looked at the git issue link I posted you'll understand. Have you looked at it?
[12:53:00] <Yepp> it causes a double trigger change
[12:53:10] <Yepp> ugh
[12:53:18] <robertmaxrees> but why are you validating the input?
[12:53:33] <Yepp> input produced by the selectized?
[12:53:43] <robertmaxrees> what other input would i be referencing?
[12:53:49] <Yepp> just to make it uniform with other inputs
[12:54:07] <robertmaxrees> are you using it for autocomplete?
[12:54:16] <robertmaxrees> or providing options for the user to choose from?
[12:54:24] <Yepp> the second one
[12:54:30] <robertmaxrees> then you don't need to validate it.
[12:54:37] <Yepp> there would be a long list so letting the user type helps
[12:54:39] <robertmaxrees> unless you're trying to mark it as required.
[12:54:45] <Yepp> it is required
[12:55:20] <robertmaxrees> so what validator are you using?
[12:55:31] <Yepp> 1000hz's validator
[12:55:31] <robertmaxrees> that 1000hz one?
[12:55:38] <Yepp> http://1000hz.github.io/bootstrap-validator/
[12:56:04] <Yepp> yea
[12:57:00] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/1000hz/bootstrap-validator/issues/193
[12:57:05] <robertmaxrees> looks like that's covered here.
[12:58:49] <Yepp> nope
[12:58:54] <Yepp> ugh
[12:59:02] <Yepp> i hate this -_-
[12:59:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:59:38] <robertmaxrees> it's covered in that issue.
[12:59:44] <robertmaxrees> if you need more help, make a jsfiddle then.
[12:59:56] <Yepp> hmm
[13:00:06] <Yepp> i'll rather pull it in my server
[13:00:09] <Yepp> i guess
[13:00:19] <Yepp> or i dunno
[13:00:57] <robertmaxrees> make a jsfiddle.
[13:01:13] <robertmaxrees> it forces you to look at everything again which often helps people find the problem.
[13:01:28] <robertmaxrees> and if that doesn't help, then if gives us something to modify/play with.
[13:01:33] <robertmaxrees> s/if/it
[13:01:33] <b-ot> Correction, <robertmaxrees> and it that doesn't help, then it gives us something to modity/play with.
[13:02:54] <taplar> perfect
[13:03:51] <arif__> In jquery autocomplete ui, what would be the event when the autocomplete suggestions drop down and the user focuses on a suggestion using an arrow key?
[13:04:17] <taplar> iirc, it's not a jqui event.  its just a hover
[13:04:42] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#event-focus
[13:04:44] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[13:13:10] <graphettion_> How's taplar and bobby tables doing?
[13:13:24] <taplar> bobby tables?
[13:13:41] <graphettion_> robertmaxrees
[13:14:16] <taplar> i'm ok.  pretty good actually.  just cracked a groovy problem that was starting to piss me off
[13:14:33] <robertmaxrees> i'm a lot of things right now.
[13:15:06] <arif__> @robertmaxrees thanks! it would be better if this could be done by targeting .ui-menu-item. any idea?
[13:15:07] <taplar> i...AM....smellin like a rose that some....
[13:15:22] <robertmaxrees> arif__ huh?
[13:15:29] <robertmaxrees> arif__ ming clarifying why?
[13:15:39] <robertmaxrees> or otherwise creating a fiddle to show what you're trying to do?
[13:15:43] <Yepp> cant reproduce it in fiddle robert
[13:15:49] <robertmaxrees> Yepp why not?
[13:15:52] <robertmaxrees> is all your code in there?
[13:15:54] <Yepp> it does not accept empty <option>
[13:16:41] <robertmaxrees> Yepp i don't understand what that has to do with your question w/r/t the text input.
[13:16:50] <robertmaxrees> show me what you have.
[13:16:56] <graphettion_> robertmaxrees, I'll massage your shoulders and make you relax. - http://67.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lttkm8cyWL1qgevfco1_500.jpg

[13:17:08] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:17:10] <Yepp> it has to do with it cause, that's the default value err you get what i mean
[13:17:23] <robertmaxrees> Yepp I really don't.
[13:17:28] <Yepp> hmm
[13:18:11] <graphettion_> robertmaxrees, you taking things too srsly you need to learn to relax.
[13:18:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:18:34] <robertmaxrees> i give up.

[13:22:27] <taplar> so much privacy
[13:22:39] <graphettion_> ^
[13:22:57] <Yepp> should I consider that yes or no? :v
[13:24:18] <graphettion_> Talk to taplar. :P

[13:26:23] <graphettion_> Didn't mean to cause drama.
[13:26:48] <Yepp> ok fine. Hold on, I'll just change something
[13:26:53] <arc_> i believe you
[13:27:01] <arc_> but telling someone to "learn to relax" is going to have the opposite effect

[13:57:34] <chchris> hey guys - I'm having a load of issues using selectors in context of a html string which I've parsed - any ideas? I've been banging my head against it for bloody ages... http://pastebin.com/niAz0cEc
[14:01:40] <hasson> Hello, anyone can help me with this issue that only happen on chrome? https://jsfiddle.net/g5hr46em/  the second action that is a change the text does not work on chrome, only on firefox
[14:05:32] <taplar> chchris: the parseHTML is eating the <body> tag
[14:05:37] <taplar> the p is a top level element
[14:06:10] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ywae7dj7/
[14:06:42] <arc_> why is it doing that
[14:06:57] <chchris> taplar - I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean
[14:08:47] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseHTML/
[14:09:14] <arc_> is it because you can't have two body tags or something
[14:09:50] <taplar> typically you don't parse a whole document.  it's a known thing that jquery will eat some tags
[14:09:52] <chchris> it doesn't work, even withint the body tag
[14:09:53] <taplar> iirc
[14:10:36] <taplar> even if you change it to just $(yourHtmlString) it still eats the body tag
[14:11:00] <hasson> Hello, anyone can help me with this issue that only happen on chrome? https://jsfiddle.net/g5hr46em/  the second action that is a change the text does not work on chrome, only on firefox
[14:13:16] <shoky> chchris: if you're looking for a top-level element then you need to use .filter() instead of .find() (what you're doing is equivalent to using .find)
[14:14:23] <shoky> so e.g.  $(selectorContext).filter("p").each(...
[14:14:51] <chchris> shoky but it won't be top level... it will eventually be buried with ridiculous markup :(
[14:14:54] <chchris> https://jsbin.com/xagobevaho/1/edit?html,css,js,output
[14:15:06] <shoky> chchris: and if you want a way to avoid having to decide you can do   $('<div>').append(selectorContext).find("p")
[14:20:17] <kouki> hi
[14:20:21] <chchris> shoky! Thanks man - that's worked a treat
[14:20:23] <kouki> is in this code something wrong: http://pastebin.com/4MejkRsb
[14:20:24] <kouki> ?
[14:20:31] <chchris> any idea why i can't alert (this.html()) ?
[14:20:38] <kouki> because it doesn't work as i wanted (fadein element when page starts)
[14:20:46] <shoky> chchris: donno what `this` is, but anyways stop using alert man
[14:21:10] <chchris> shoky sorry dude... I'm too old :(
[14:21:27] <chchris>                 $(".hello", $('<div>').append( selectorContext)).each(function( i ) {           alert (this.html());        });
[14:21:48] <shoky> because `this` is the DOM element, not the jquery object
[14:21:53] <shoky> $(this).html()
[14:22:26] <chchris> perfect - thanks shoky
[14:22:31] <chchris> and a good time for me to leave work!
[14:22:33] <chchris> Thanks!
[14:22:34] <chchris> Buy
[14:22:35] <chchris> bye!
[14:22:43] <shoky> byby
[14:26:08] <kouki> any help?
[14:28:56] <shoky> kouki: the code looks fine
[14:29:53] <kouki> it would work on div when page start, div is formatted by css, i don't see errors in javascript console
[14:31:06] <kouki> ok i have repaired
[14:31:16] <kouki> just fadeOut(1); before
[14:31:17] <kouki> idk why
[14:31:19] <kouki> but it works
[14:31:19] <kouki> so
[14:38:05] <shoky> kouki: sounds like it wasn't hidden to begin with?
[14:38:16] <kouki> yeah
[14:39:01] <shoky> you can hide it in the initial css
[14:39:25] <kouki> hmm?
[14:39:44] <shoky> display: none
[15:44:38] <dedondesta> anyone knows how to set <select> programmaticaly in the webkit browser
[15:44:47] <dedondesta> i.e. google chrome
[15:46:40] <hasson> Hello, anyone can help me with this issue that only happen on chrome? https://jsfiddle.net/g5hr46em/  the second action that is a change the text does not work on chrome, only on firefox
[16:07:27] <taplar> hasson: what are you saying is different?  they appear the same in both browsers for me
[16:07:51] <hasson> taplar, in chorme, the text button change to you?
[16:08:03] <taplar> yep
[16:08:20] <hasson> taplar, it change to NEW TEXT BUTTON? :o
[16:08:33] <taplar> yep
[16:10:44] <hasson> taplar, on google chrome here it skip this part of code         $("#test").html("NEW TEXT BUTTON");
[16:10:45] <hasson>  and change only on the end
[16:11:02] <hasson> if you look the code, AFTER the alert BEGIN, it should change the text, and does not
[16:11:06] <hasson> on firefox it does
[16:11:35] <taplar> your saying the visible text of the button doesn't change for you?
[16:14:45] <taplar> ?
[16:17:45] <taplar> dedondesta: you can just set it's val() if you know it
[16:20:27] <hasson> taplar, sorry, customer was on the phone.
[16:21:11] <hasson> taplar, the script is supposed to do on this order: show alert BEGIN, and BEFORE the alert "after changes" must change the button to "new text button"
[16:21:18] <hasson> and does not do on chrome, just on firefox
[16:22:42] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/g5hr46em/1/
[16:22:43] <dedondesta> taplar: not in webkit browser
[16:23:10] <dedondesta> taplar: webkit means runs on iOS
[16:23:30] <taplar> ah, i can't test that then, :)
[16:24:19] <dedondesta> taplar: i figured i can use selectedIndex, i'm having hard time figuring out hot to get an index of the particual option by value
[16:24:41] <taplar> you can use index()
[16:25:12] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/index/ <-- two different flavors
[16:26:07] <hasson> taplar, but I need an alert (actually I call an function), the console log works for me as well...
[16:26:18] <taplar> why do you need the alert?
[16:26:41] <hasson> taplar, because when the customer click on button, it will call a AJAX function
[16:26:48] <taplar> so?
[16:27:16] <hasson> taplar, so, its same logic as the case of the alert. on my code I replace the alert with my function
[16:27:25] <hasson> and does not work, same as with alert does not work
[16:27:48] <taplar> what is the error your seeing?
[16:28:29] <taplar> i'm not seeing how your using an alert, which is a blocking action, to replace an ajax call to simulate anything
[16:28:39] <hasson> taplar, it does not call my function, same as does not call the         $("#test").html("NEW TEXT BUTTON"); on my script https://jsfiddle.net/g5hr46em/
[16:29:16] <taplar> i'd have to see the actual script.  what your saying isn't making sense
[16:29:20] <hasson> taplar, when the customer clicks on the button, it call the ajax function with a loader (loading....) when ajax return true it close the loader and ends the action
[16:29:28] <hasson> taplar, let me get to ou
[16:29:31] <hasson> hold on please
[16:29:36] <taplar> you realize that ajax is asynchronous, right?
[16:29:47] <taplar> it's not going to block
[16:42:30] <hasson> taplar, our code will not be clear, im changing the jsfiddle to exatactly what I want to do :),
[16:49:44] <Ryanar> how can I call .append() on a class selection like $('.some-repeated-class')[0].append(...)
[16:50:14] <taplar> don't do the [0]
[16:50:25] <Ryanar> but I don't want to append to all, only the first one
[16:50:27] <taplar> use either eq(0) or first()
[16:50:33] <Ryanar> oooh right eq(0)
[17:09:56] <hasson> taplar, done, please check first on firefox, and after on chrome
[17:09:56] <hasson> https://jsfiddle.net/g5hr46em/5/
[17:11:23] <taplar> you should avoid doing async false.  it locks up the browser
[17:12:03] <taplar> aside from that, your saying the html isn't being restored?
[17:12:42] <hasson> taplar, im saying that in chrome does call that!         $(this).html("Loading...").prop("disabled",true);
[17:12:49] <hasson> just test on chrome you will see :)
[17:13:57] <taplar> what version of jquery are you using?
[17:17:14] <hasson> taplar, jquery-2.2.4
[17:17:19] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/g5hr46em/6/ works for me in chrome with an older version of jquery
[17:17:19] <hasson> taplar, tested on 3.x and same error
[17:17:27] <taplar> async false has been deprecated
[17:17:40] <taplar> like i said, you shouldn't use that.  you should use the callbacks instead
[17:18:17] <hasson> taplar, the problem is not the ajax
[17:18:26] <hasson> same error occour with only alert as well
[17:18:29] <hasson> as I showed before
[17:18:37] <taplar> what error?
[17:18:48] <shoky> you shouldn't use async:false, and you shouldn't use alerts, for similar reasons
[17:19:22] <hasson> taplar, on firefox, when you click, the button change to LOADING https://jsfiddle.net/g5hr46em/5/
[17:19:31] <hasson> on chrome does not.
[17:20:01] <shoky> hasson: it happens on chrome too but only after the ajax finishes, too fast to see
[17:20:04] <taplar> its most likely hitting the ajax call before it gets a chance to redraw
[17:20:08] <shoky> ^
[17:20:31] <hasson> shoky, yes this is the issue, with ajax, without ajax, with alert, with anything
[17:20:37] <shoky> stop using async:false and alerts
[17:20:38] <shoky> just stop.
[17:20:47] <shoky> they freeze the browser
[17:20:50] <hasson> got it
[17:20:53] <hasson> this is the issue so
[17:20:54] <shoky> so it doesnt even get to paint
[17:21:00] <taplar> it's a self imposed issue
[17:21:21] <shoky> it's working as it should
[17:21:42] <hasson> but why on firefox works perfectly???
[17:21:53] <shoky> who cares? you're using something you're not supposed to use
[17:23:14] <hasson> shoky, ok this a simple function, my first example, it's not to clear for me whats is wrong on the "main idea" https://jsfiddle.net/s2ycuhkw/
[17:23:36] <shoky> it works perfectly in chrome too.  javascript is SINGLE threaded - doing .html("Loading") doesn't actually paint anything yet,  js has to "let go" first
[17:23:50] <shoky> hasson: don't use alerts.
[17:24:02] <hasson> but why? what is the issue with that?
[17:24:07] <shoky> they FREEZE THE BROWSER
[17:24:18] <shoky> it can't render or do anything
[17:24:18] <hasson> got it
[17:24:24] <hasson> got it
[17:24:25] <shoky> it's bad UI
[17:24:29] <shoky> bad everything
[17:24:36] <shoky> there is no reason to do it, or to ask about it
[17:26:13] <hasson> ok. got it but has not logic... Alert freezed ), after clicked "ok" -> UNFREEZED (text should be changed before next alert), and then second alert pop up.
[17:26:25] <shoky> just "got it".  no "but" :)
[17:26:45] <hasson> shoky, you agree that is no sense thinking on script execution right?
[17:26:45] <shoky> and dont say got it if you're gonna keep asking the same thing ;p
[17:27:01] <shoky> there is no sense in thinking of what's supposed to happen when there's alerts going on
[17:27:14] <taplar> nothing is happening when an alert is up
[17:27:20] <taplar> that's what frozen means
[17:27:24] <hasson> and when alert goes down? =p
[17:27:29] <hasson> there are 3 events!
[17:27:46] <taplar> hokay, take care
[17:27:53] <hasson> but nevermind.
[17:28:03] <hasson> will google about alert freeze and understand more
[17:28:32] <hasson> because for me its a script executing in order. alert 1 freeze, click ok unfreeze, execute the script in order, and go to next actions
[17:29:04] <taplar> there is no guarentee that the browser will redraw before your next freeze
[17:29:42] <taplar> and you should not freeze to being with
[17:29:51] <taplar> as both of us have been saying
[17:30:01] <hasson> ok!
[17:30:15] <hasson> will assume and code interpretation issue due alerts.
[17:30:20] <hasson> ;p
[17:30:28] <hasson> and find other way
[17:30:36] <shoky> hasson: this is what happens sorta..   alert("BEGIN")  pops up the alert, then you click OK,  then the .html() and .hide() are executed - but those changes ARE NOT RENDERED YET because javascript has not finished executing yet.  then there is the 2nd and 3rd alerts.
[17:31:04] <shoky> hasson: then after last alert is finished, only then javascript execution has finished and "let go" and only now the browser is free to render stuff
[17:31:40] <hasson> shoky, understood 100% now.
[17:31:52] <shoky> on the other hand, if you DONT use alert,  then javascript execution will "let go" immediately because nothing will be freezing it
[17:31:58] <shoky> awesome
[17:32:46] <hasson> taplar, shoky clear for me now, will look other way to do what I want.
[17:32:57] <hasson> thanks for clear explations
[17:33:05] <shoky> no alerts, no async:false, do stuff in callbacks.  :)
[17:33:07] <shoky> np
[19:07:45] <MassDebates> howdy, anyone here?
[19:07:52] <taplar> sure
[19:08:03] <MassDebates> heya
[19:08:04] <MassDebates> quick question
[19:08:18] <MassDebates> Trying to experiment a bit with jquery and I've got a bunch of variables getting set by a form
[19:08:46] <MassDebates> I went ahead and thought I can test my ability with the syntax by setting up a form on a codepen with about 8 inputs.
[19:11:36] <MassDebates> Sorry, back
[19:12:03] <MassDebates> Each of the inputs of the form get their values to their own unique variable
[19:13:41] <MassDebates> What I'd like to know is if what I'm trying to do is undoable, or if it's just done by me incorrectly
[19:13:42] <MassDebates> $(".result").css({ 'flex-grow' : groVal, conKey1 : conKey1 });
[19:14:05] <MassDebates> Ohp
[19:14:13] <MassDebates> hold on i think i see a typoi
[19:19:24] <MassDebates> Alright, I'm back
[19:19:35] <MassDebates> My experiment worked! but I have another question
[19:20:27] <MassDebates> Say I grab an element by a class but I want to add inline styles to the element matching the class. .css() doesn't do that if I've grabbed the element by a class, right?
[19:20:48] <taplar> sure
[19:21:05] <taplar> regardless of how you grab it, css puts inline styles on all the found elements
[19:28:46] <MassDebates> taplar:  thanks man, one more thing I'd like to know
[19:29:39] <MassDebates> in the above example, 'flex-grow' works with groVal, but conKey1 isn't working with conVal1
[19:29:51] <taplar> what is conKey1?
[19:30:04] <MassDebates> it's a value submitted by a form
[19:30:17] <taplar> you can't use variables for object keys like that
[19:30:21] <MassDebates> Shit
[19:30:25] <MassDebates> Why now
[19:30:27] <MassDebates> not*
[19:30:27] <taplar> break it up first
[19:30:37] <MassDebates> hm
[19:31:05] <taplar> var props = { 'flex-grow' : groVal }; props[conKey1] = conKey1; $(...).css(props);
[19:31:24] <MassDebates> https://www.pastery.net/vqpmxz/
[19:31:44] <MassDebates> Oh, shoot, let me look at that
[19:31:51] <MassDebates> props?
[19:31:56] <taplar> yeah, all those keys it's taking them as literal strings
[19:32:02] <taplar> you can name it whatever
[19:32:12] <MassDebates> oh, okay, that's just for my context
[19:32:13] <taplar> just an object that holds all the key values your going to give to css
[19:32:35] <MassDebates> hm
[19:32:46] <taplar> also don't forget to put a var in front of all those varaibles
[19:33:05] <MassDebates> woah, hold up
[19:33:15] <MassDebates> okay, this is big, thanks a real lot
[19:33:31] <MassDebates> So lets see
[19:33:35] <MassDebates> what is props?
[19:33:38] <MassDebates> I mean, I know it's my context
[19:33:43] <MassDebates> but like, what -is- it?
[19:33:46] <taplar> "properties"
[19:33:51] <taplar> is what i was going for
[19:33:54] <MassDebates> No i know that
[19:33:59] <MassDebates> but what role is it playing in jquery?
[19:34:02] <MassDebates> some array label?
[19:34:07] <taplar> nothing, it's just a js object
[19:34:17] <MassDebates> sorry, 1st day writing this stuff
[19:34:22] <MassDebates> I gotta look up a js object
[19:34:25] <taplar> { key: value }
[19:34:37] <taplar> you can think of it like a map, if that helps
[19:34:45] <taplar> or a hash
[19:35:10] <taplar> css can take in an object as it's parameter, which is what you were trying to do
[19:35:26] <MassDebates> Not only the value, but the property as well! yes!
[19:35:31] <taplar> breaking it out on its own before hand lets you do the bracket notation so you can use your variables for the keys
[19:35:41] <MassDebates> Okay, so let me get this straight:
[19:36:11] <MassDebates> 1st thing I gotta do is 'break it out'. Then I need to throw in brackets to notate them as keys?
[19:36:25] <taplar> ok, so there are two ways of accessing objects
[19:36:29] <taplar> take for instance
[19:36:43] <taplar> var something = { name: 'me', age: 'who knows' };
[19:36:54] <taplar> I can access name with: something.name
[19:37:01] <taplar> or something["name"]
[19:37:30] <taplar> both result in the same access.  the difference is the first way (which is called dot notation) doesn't play nice with variables
[19:37:37] <taplar> the second however, doesn't care
[19:37:45] <taplar> something[ someVariableIDontCare ]
[19:38:13] <taplar> it'll take the value in that variable, and try to find the key on the object that matches it
[19:38:34] <taplar> likewise if I wanted to add something new to the object
[19:38:42] <taplar> something.address = "over here!";
[19:38:53] <taplar> something["address"] = "over here!";
[19:38:55] <taplar> same thing
[19:38:58] <MassDebates> okay
[19:39:04] <MassDebates> I'm gonna edit my pastery and link it
[19:39:21] <MassDebates> Can you tell me if I understood you correctly? Like a test?
[19:39:26] <taplar> sure
[19:39:59] <MassDebates> Thanks. I'll be honest, I'm actually on my friend's computer, but he's letting me use it right now to learn some javascript. he said I have to be a 'codemonkey' for him later.
[19:40:12] <taplar> heh
[19:40:14] <MassDebates> Whatever that means... anyway, I'll cross that bridge when I come to it.
[19:40:26] <taplar> means your going to be his b****, ;)
[19:40:32] <MassDebates> Oh my god I'm going to make him so prou
[19:40:33] <MassDebates> what?
[19:40:44] <MassDebates> No way
[19:41:59] <taplar> also as a side note, you might want to hit up ##javascript later.  they may can point you to a good js intro tutorial you can learn on.
[19:42:20] <taplar> idk any off hand, except maybe coderanch.  *goes to google*
[19:42:26] <taplar> i'm sure there are lots
[19:42:39] <MassDebates> Thanks, I'll do that.
[19:44:59] <MassDebates> okay quick question
[19:45:09] <MassDebates> props[conKey1] = conKey1;
[19:45:29] <taplar> https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript
[19:45:33] <taplar> yup?
[19:45:56] <MassDebates> ok
[19:46:12] <MassDebates> so uh
[19:46:32] <MassDebates> er
[19:46:37] <MassDebates> I don't put that around every line
[19:46:47] <taplar> 'that'?
[19:46:58] <MassDebates> props[conKey1] = conKey1;
[19:47:06] <MassDebates> props[conKey2] = conKey2;
[19:47:13] <MassDebates> That doesn't make sense; wouldn't i do it like
[19:47:23] <MassDebates> oh wait
[19:47:30] <MassDebates> Because it sets the key for props on each one
[19:47:37] <taplar> yup
[19:47:40] <MassDebates> I'm using conVal1 in conjunction with conVal2
[19:47:45] <MassDebates> er
[19:47:46] <MassDebates> fuck
[19:47:56] <MassDebates> conKey1 as the property for conVal1
[19:48:16] <MassDebates> so if conKey1 was 'width' and conVal1 was "5px" then width:5px; right?
[19:48:33] <MassDebates> if I did it like that? props[conKey1] = conKey1;
[19:48:36] <taplar> prop[conKey1] = conVal1;
[19:48:38] <MassDebates> But I don't need to do it for vals, then
[19:48:42] <MassDebates> Oh okay
[19:49:02] <MassDebates> props[conKey1] = $("#conKey1").val(); I can do this too?
[19:49:04] <taplar> though, why do you have two variables?
[19:49:05] <MassDebates> er
[19:49:12] <MassDebates> props[conKey1] = $("#conVal1").val();
[19:49:38] <taplar> i guess your letting the user input the key and the value
[19:49:41] <MassDebates> Shit
[19:49:48] <MassDebates> Hold on, I know what I'm trying to say
[19:49:50] <MassDebates> lmao
[19:50:04] <MassDebates> yes, I'm letting the user determine the property and the value set for the rule
[19:50:06] <MassDebates> but
[19:50:19] <MassDebates> This is what I want: (pastery.net link inbound) right?
[19:51:52] <MassDebates> https://www.pastery.net/hxrpfz/\
[19:51:54] <MassDebates> https://www.pastery.net/hxrpfz/
[19:52:18] <taplar> no you also have to lookup your keys
[19:53:29] <MassDebates> hm, this doesn't map it??
[19:53:51] <taplar> props[conKey1] = $("#conKey1").val();
[19:53:56] <taplar> conKey1 isn't defined anywhere in the js
[19:54:57] <MassDebates> Here, this might be better
[19:55:13] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2nm13r/
[19:55:19] <taplar> update that guy with what your trying to do
[19:55:27] <MassDebates> Oh shit
[19:55:29] <taplar> see if you can make an object with the two key values
[19:55:29] <MassDebates> Mind blown
[19:55:38] <MassDebates> wtf how come Ryan didn't tell me this shit
[19:55:46] <MassDebates> I've been fucking playing with notepad
[19:55:49] <MassDebates> omfg
[19:55:50] <taplar> :)
[19:57:13] <MassDebates> okay
[19:57:50] <graphettion> taplar dat azz
[19:57:52] <graphettion> sup?
[19:58:02] <taplar> nada, getting ready to head home
[19:58:08] <graphettion> get outta here :)
[19:58:14] <taplar> you got him?
[19:58:32] <graphettion> Not sure what he's doing. Just wanted to say hello.
[19:58:34] <MassDebates> hi
[19:58:39] <MassDebates> Okay so I think
[19:58:46] <taplar> ah that's cool. i can stick around a bit more
[19:58:52] <taplar> he's introing to js
[19:59:12] <MassDebates> how do i separate each line for props?
[19:59:22] <taplar> what do you mean?
[19:59:27] <MassDebates> var props = { groVal = $("#groVal").val(); shrVal = $("#shrVal").val(); basVal = $("#basVal").val(); };?
[19:59:29] <MassDebates> er
[19:59:35] <MassDebates> sorry
[19:59:40] <MassDebates> i'm just gonna type it out 2 secs
[19:59:45] <taplar> inside of an object you don't use semi colons
[19:59:53] <taplar> and it's key:value instead of an =
[19:59:57] <MassDebates> It didn't like commas though
[20:00:03] <MassDebates> how do I seperate it? What if there's whitespace??!
[20:00:16] <taplar> it ignores white space outside of the key and value
[20:00:21] <MassDebates> oh
[20:00:24] <MassDebates> well that's nice
[20:00:26] <MassDebates> okay
[20:00:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2nm13r/1/
[20:02:12] <graphettion> ah, he's just learning objects
[20:02:13] <MassDebates> Okay, i'm almost done
[20:02:23] <taplar> true blue new guy, ^_^
[20:02:41] <graphettion> cool
[20:02:59] <graphettion> next one might be a prototype question :P
[20:03:20] <taplar> heh, i think i'd be hard pressed to explain those with any confidence
[20:03:24] <MassDebates> okay so I've got this
[20:03:30] <MassDebates> I declared the variables
[20:03:32] <graphettion> hehe
[20:03:38] <MassDebates> And I set up props
[20:03:47] <taplar> MassDebates: hit the update button up top and then share out the new link in chat
[20:04:17] <graphettion> ^ better than explaining - it's all in the code
[20:04:38] <MassDebates> okay
[20:05:35] <MassDebates> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2nm13r/2/
[20:05:44] <MassDebates> I couldn't figure out why it gave it a 2 instead of a 1
[20:06:00] <taplar> alright so one more thing
[20:06:05] <MassDebates> I didn't put in single quotes because I didn't want it to be a string
[20:06:10] <MassDebates> er, not a string exactly as the chars
[20:06:15] <MassDebates> but i wanted it to like 'do the stuff'
[20:06:26] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2nm13r/3/
[20:06:38] <taplar> so take a look at what your props is in the console
[20:07:18] <MassDebates> ok
[20:07:44] <MassDebates> Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 522 (Origin Connection Time-out)
[20:08:03] <taplar> ? your looking at your browser console, right?
[20:08:29] <MassDebates> Object {conKey1: "a", conVal1: "b", conKey2: "", conVal2: ""}
[20:08:37] <taplar> there ya go
[20:08:43] <taplar> so what's wrong with that?
[20:08:51] <graphettion> Don't worry about that error. I think it's a connection issue with jquery because you're using jquery twice.
[20:08:57] <MassDebates> oh
[20:09:06] <MassDebates> SHIT i gotta go
[20:09:09] <MassDebates> I'll be bakc in like
[20:09:09] <graphettion> One in resources and one in the JavaScript tab
[20:09:11] <MassDebates> 15 minutes
[20:09:21] <graphettion> taplar, go ahead and leave I GOTTEM
[20:09:24] <MassDebates> I'm gonna put this on my phone so I can talk to you guys in the car
[20:09:28] <MassDebates> give me like 2 secs
[20:09:31] <taplar> woah, who put that there
[20:09:32] <graphettion> kk
[20:09:47] <taplar> you don't need the resources one, it's included in the javascript tab
[20:09:53] <graphettion> ^
[20:10:03] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2nm13r/5/
[20:10:23] <graphettion> Use /5 from now on, MassDebates
[20:10:35] <MassDebates> ok
[20:10:42] <MassDebates> I really really need to go, but the app's not connecting.
[20:10:46] <MassDebates> Give me like 5 mins
[20:10:48] <graphettion> taplar, go home man :)
[20:10:55] <taplar> k, yeah i gotta run myself, :D
[20:11:00] <graphettion> later later
[20:11:03] <taplar> gl MassDebates.  later graphettion
[20:11:56] <graphettion> MassDebates, take your time I'll be here for a lil bit.
[20:22:36] <Fritx> hey, is it normal that javascript function don't execute in order ?
[20:25:41] <graphettion> Fritx, you can do async functions that will initialize in order, but can execute at the same time
[20:26:28] <Fritx> graphettion I need to chain functions in a certain order, but each one of them need to wait until the previous one is done
[20:26:54] <graphettion> Fritx, sounds like you want timeouts
[20:27:25] <lholmquist> Fritx: graphettion promises are perfect for that situation
[20:28:05] <graphettion> true dat
[20:28:17] <Fritx> I was able to use promises for two functions, but the logic doesn't work after that
[20:28:49] <Fritx> so I would do function1().done(function2().done(function3()))
[20:29:26] <Fritx> or am I inversing the order ??
[21:00:02] <taplar> mmm, doughnuts...
[21:00:59] <Trublooguy> Hey!
[21:01:02] <Trublooguy> I made it!
[21:02:30] <Trublooguy> Hello??
[21:02:35] <taplar> sup
[21:02:43] <Trublooguy> Omg hi
[21:02:54] <Trublooguy> Wow you stayed
[21:03:03] <taplar> i'm home now, :P
[21:03:03] <Trublooguy> Is me
[21:03:20] <Trublooguy> I'm the guy learning. Sorry, I don't have his password information
[21:03:42] <Trublooguy> I was hoping you'd recognize me with the name!!
[21:04:39] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2nm13r/5/
[21:06:35] <Trublooguy> Awesome thanks I didn't have that
[21:06:52] <Trublooguy> I'm going to log on a computer now. Different comp
[21:08:08] <TruooBluGuy> Okay, there we go
[21:08:10] <TruooBluGuy> I'm at full power!
[21:08:24] <TrooBluGu> omg
[21:11:50] <TrueBlueGuy> you have that pastery i sent taplar ?
[21:12:37] <taplar> this guy? https://www.pastery.net/hxrpfz/
[21:12:49] <TrueBlueGuy> thanks
[21:16:34] <TrueBlueGuy> is the jsfiddle actually 2 functions?
[21:16:46] <TrueBlueGuy> jQuery(function($) {function makeTheObject() {
[21:17:25] <taplar> yep, its doing a jquery closure and the inner one is used for the button click callback
[21:18:30] <TrueBlueGuy> ok
[21:18:40] <TrueBlueGuy> so the console statement is part of the closure function?
[21:18:46] <TrueBlueGuy> cause of the }
[21:19:05] <taplar> both are inside the callback function, the makeTheObject function
[21:21:40] <taplar> so back to the object.  what currently is wrong with it?
[21:21:47] <TrueBlueGuy> Uh
[21:21:52] <TrueBlueGuy> let me check
[21:22:47] <TrueBlueGuy> idk
[21:23:11] <taplar> what should the object look like?
[21:24:08] <TrueBlueGuy> I feel like I missed part of the lesson while I was gone
[21:24:11] <TrueBlueGuy> Did you continue with the class?
[21:24:41] <taplar> originally you were trying to do something like css({ width: 20, height: 40 }) , right?
[21:24:53] <TrueBlueGuy> oh, I don't have the code anymore -_-
[21:25:04] <TrueBlueGuy> Its on his computer; I had to leave in a rush
[21:25:24] <taplar> yeah that's what you were trying to do, :P
[21:25:46] <taplar> you have inputs for the keys and the values and you were wanting to give them to the css() method
[21:25:52] <TrueBlueGuy> There's nothing I'm really making for this; I wanted to create a set of input fields that the user can type into, hit enter, and then watch the CSS reflect the input
[21:26:15] <TrueBlueGuy> I figured it'd be a good way to cover some facets of jquery's language constructs and functions :)
[21:26:40] <taplar> right, so since they are variables you have to do them one and a time, or create the object with all the keys and values and then give that object to css()
[21:27:32] <TrueBlueGuy> I'll do that and I'll call the object 'props'
[21:28:27] <taplar> ok, so with that in mind, and looking up at css() how the object is, how does that differ from the object you are currently creating?
[21:29:28] <TrueBlueGuy> Well, before I wasn't using an object
[21:29:48] <TrueBlueGuy> I was using forms and jquery to sort of 'hash-together' CSS rules by converting inputs to strings that are injected into inline styles
[21:29:49] <taplar> you were, you were just constructing it incorrectly.  you were trying to use a variable as a key
[21:29:55] <TrueBlueGuy> Yes
[21:30:00] <TrueBlueGuy> Now I'm going to make it right
[21:30:10] <TrueBlueGuy> So first I'm gonna bracket the shit outta these puppies
[21:30:23] <TrueBlueGuy> Then I'm gonna pass props into .css()
[21:30:31] <taplar> alright, go for it
[21:30:35] <TrueBlueGuy> okay
[21:30:42] <TrueBlueGuy> Can i have the example you gave me earlier in the chat log?
[21:30:45] <TrueBlueGuy> or is it:
[21:31:04] <TrueBlueGuy> wait, do I keep my var statement in there? Isn't that making the object 'props' already?
[21:31:35] <taplar> the var on props is making it a local variable
[21:32:42] <TrueBlueGuy> okay, i can do this. I've got the documentation up
[21:32:48] <TrueBlueGuy> dont tell me the answer
[21:38:33] <TrueBlueGuy> okay im trying something
[21:44:10] <TrueBlueGuy> OMG
[21:44:12] <TrueBlueGuy> I THINK IM DOING IT
[21:44:13] <TrueBlueGuy> hold on
[21:44:16] <TrueBlueGuy> I'ma show you
[21:52:05] <TrueBlueGuy> okay I did it
[21:52:07] <TrueBlueGuy> I made an object
[21:52:18] <TrueBlueGuy> I didn't realize that var makes objects in addition to variables!
[21:52:38] <taplar> uh, no it doesn't.  your storing the object in a variable
[21:53:05] <taplar> var x = 3; var y = { key: 'value' };
[21:53:16] <taplar> x and y are variables.  what they hold can be anything really
[21:53:33] <TrueBlueGuy> shit
[21:53:43] <taplar> you don't need the var to make variables, but it scopes them down which you want to do
[21:55:47] <TrueBlueGuy> okay, so I think that's why he told me to stay away from w3schools
[21:55:55] <TrueBlueGuy> Those guys are saying something completely different
[21:56:14] <TrueBlueGuy> like wth he told me sites not to go to but no sites TO go to. like jsfiddle, how the hell does he not know about that
[21:56:41] <taplar> *shrug* i did js many years and didn't know about jsfiddle
[21:56:50] <taplar> somethings your just not exposed to, :)
[21:58:32] <TrueBlueGuy> is an array an object?
[21:58:38] <taplar> yep
[21:58:47] <taplar> most things in js are
[22:00:10] <TrueBlueGuy> So I want an array
[22:00:13] <TrueBlueGuy> with keys as conkey
[22:00:16] <TrueBlueGuy> and conval
[22:00:18] <taplar> that's an object
[22:00:20] <TrueBlueGuy> as the values
[22:00:24] <taplar> arrays do not have keys
[22:00:43] <TrueBlueGuy> I thought an array was an object
[22:00:44] <taplar> well, non-numeric keys
[22:00:52] <taplar> right, but it's a different type of object
[22:01:01] <TrueBlueGuy> Next time I meet some guy with the last name "Java" i'm smacking him in the face
[22:01:10] <taplar> what you are after is an object
[22:01:15] <TrueBlueGuy> okay
[22:01:42] <TrueBlueGuy> So what's wrong with what I had?
[22:01:45] <taplar> that fiddle i shared showed a basic object.  you just need to change it so your keys are keys and your values are their values
[22:01:55] <TrueBlueGuy> Oh shit really
[22:02:50] <taplar> that's what i was saying when i stated what css() was wanting and asked you how that object differed
[22:03:12] <TrueBlueGuy> Wait
[22:03:16] <TrueBlueGuy> it looks just like mine though
[22:03:26] <taplar> neither are correct...
[22:03:29] <TrueBlueGuy> well, it looked* just like mine until I thought you said I was wrong
[22:03:34] <TrueBlueGuy> oh okay
[22:03:38] <TrueBlueGuy> Ugh, I'm sorry
[22:03:40] <TrueBlueGuy> I'm really trying here.
[22:03:46] <taplar> css({ width: 20, height: 40 })
[22:04:01] <taplar> on that fiddle, if you put in those keys and values, how can you make the object look the same?
[22:04:28] <TrueBlueGuy> Got it
[22:04:30] <TrueBlueGuy> Dont tell me
[22:18:31] <TrueBlueGuy> IM sorry
[22:18:32] <TrueBlueGuy> hold on
[22:18:36] <TrueBlueGuy> PLease dont give me the answer yet
[22:18:43] <TrueBlueGuy> I'm working on it
[22:18:49] <taplar> heh, if something is confusing you, just ask
[22:19:53] <TrueBlueGuy> I feel like I asked too much
[22:20:04] <taplar> the room is here for questions man
[22:20:20] <taplar> and it's slow so js questions are fair game, :)
[22:21:12] <taplar> so do you remember how i mentioned earlier that there were a couple ways of accessing objects?
[22:21:43] <TrueBlueGuy> yes
[22:21:46] <TrueBlueGuy> BUt dont tell me
[22:21:53] <taplar> tell me, what were the ways?
[22:22:05] <TrueBlueGuy> using methods like
[22:22:26] <TrueBlueGuy> accessObjectExample()
[22:22:36] <taplar> huh?
[22:22:38] <TrueBlueGuy> except that'd be a real one accessing something like
[22:22:44] <TrueBlueGuy> length()
[22:22:51] <TrueBlueGuy> you use methods, right?
[22:22:57] <taplar> accessing objects isn't a method of any kind
[22:23:16] <taplar> remember when i was doing stuff like something.name and something["name"] ?
[22:23:18] <TrueBlueGuy> I'm mixing them up
[22:23:28] <TrueBlueGuy> yeah, but that can't be the key and value
[22:23:33] <taplar> why not?
[22:23:40] <TrueBlueGuy> Because I tried it and it flipped its shit on me
[22:23:51] <TrueBlueGuy> Ill try it again
[22:24:01] <TrueBlueGuy> but you were saying they're identical
[22:24:21] <taplar> yep, they result in the same access
[22:24:33] <taplar> but the second allows you to do something else too
[22:25:05] <TrueBlueGuy> Where do I get this information?
[22:25:19] <taplar> what do you mean?
[22:25:27] <TrueBlueGuy> not the actual code info that you're talking about
[22:25:29] <TrueBlueGuy> but like
[22:25:33] <TrueBlueGuy> documentation stuff
[22:25:43] <TrueBlueGuy> Not the shit w3 documentation he told me to avoid
[22:25:45] <TrueBlueGuy> I want the juicy shit
[22:25:47] <TrueBlueGuy> the dank stuff
[22:26:06] <taplar> some tutorial would have this stuff
[22:26:17] <TrueBlueGuy> Which ones are good?
[22:26:38] <taplar> you still have that link from earlier for codecadamy?
[22:26:51] <TrueBlueGuy> no :(
[22:26:56] <TrueBlueGuy> Wait hold on
[22:27:00] <TrueBlueGuy> I'm gonna try it again though
[22:27:03] <taplar> https://www.codecademy.com/learn/javascript
[22:27:04] <TrueBlueGuy> brb
[22:27:28] <TrueBlueGuy> okay
[22:27:33] <TrueBlueGuy> I wouldn't need to make a second object, would I?
[22:27:37] <taplar> nope
[22:28:03] <taplar> first off, what is an example of one of your keys?
[22:28:07] <TrueBlueGuy> okay, scratch that version
[22:28:27] <TrueBlueGuy> inputed value to be the key, or just a key?
[22:28:38] <taplar> your css key
[22:28:43] <taplar> one of them
[22:28:56] <TrueBlueGuy> conKey1
[22:29:02] <taplar> that's not a valid css key
[22:29:09] <TrueBlueGuy> oh CSS key
[22:29:16] <TrueBlueGuy> thats what I meant by 'inputted value to be the key'
[22:29:31] <taplar> :), what's an example of a valid css key?
[22:29:35] <TrueBlueGuy> I was gonna just test with a CSS property I know to be numeric, like height and width
[22:29:42] <TrueBlueGuy> height
[22:29:49] <taplar> ok, were would height be?
[22:29:56] <TrueBlueGuy> where?
[22:29:59] <taplar> yep
[22:30:01] <TrueBlueGuy> It'd be inputted on the conKey1
[22:30:07] <taplar> ok, so how do you get it?
[22:30:13] <TrueBlueGuy> essentially I'd end up with object["conKey1"]
[22:30:32] <taplar> no, not "conKey1"
[22:30:35] <taplar> "height"
[22:30:39] <taplar> that's the valid css key
[22:30:50] <TrueBlueGuy> but I'm coding in conKey1 to use 'height' taken from the input field, right?
[22:30:55] <taplar> yep
[22:31:02] <TrueBlueGuy> yeah i get that
[22:31:22] <taplar> how do you get "height" ?
[22:31:32] <TrueBlueGuy> then how come .css( ... ) with those doesn't work?
[22:31:50] <TrueBlueGuy> object["conKey2"]
[22:31:53] <taplar> slow down, one step at a time.
[22:31:55] <taplar> no
[22:31:58] <taplar> it's not in the object yet
[22:32:06] <taplar> how do you get it?
[22:32:24] <TrueBlueGuy> if It's defined in the object then I need to access it like the other one
[22:32:31] <taplar> it's not in the object yet
[22:32:38] <taplar> you said it's in your input field
[22:32:43] <TrueBlueGuy> .val()
[22:32:49] <taplar> ok, so get it
[22:32:52] <TrueBlueGuy> $("#conKey2").val(),
[22:33:04] <taplar> that'll get you 'height' or whatever, yes
[22:33:07] <taplar> so now
[22:33:11] <taplar> how do you get the value?
[22:33:24] <taplar> err, the css value for that css key
[22:34:14] <TrueBlueGuy> $("#conVal2").val() should have the inputted value, which would be expected to be something like 500px or 10em
[22:34:25] <TrueBlueGuy> I got the CSS down. He taught me :)
[22:34:32] <taplar> alright, so you can get "height" and you can get "500px"
[22:34:37] <taplar> now, how do you put those in the object?
[22:35:12] <TrueBlueGuy> when I define the object I set its key and value for both rows of input fields
[22:35:16] <TrueBlueGuy> in this case it'd be something like
[22:35:24] <taplar> you won't be doing it when you define it
[22:35:31] <taplar> you'll be modifying it after you create it
[22:35:45] <TrueBlueGuy> ?
[22:35:47] <taplar> remember the difference between something.name and something["name"] ?
[22:36:05] <TrueBlueGuy> Well, one lets you do something but they both point at a piece of information
[22:36:09] <TrueBlueGuy> in this case "name" of something
[22:36:18] <taplar> so what's different?
[22:36:34] <TrueBlueGuy> Fuck I hate w3schools now. I was reading their page earlier and they say it's the same
[22:36:48] <TrueBlueGuy> Now that I'm trying to remember what you said, they're messing my head up
[22:37:10] <TrueBlueGuy> something about isolating
[22:37:10] <taplar> lol, i'm right here dude, if your confused, ask.  don't need no w3c, :P
[22:37:20] <TrueBlueGuy> No, i stopped going there dw
[22:37:23] <TrueBlueGuy> But I hit that page like
[22:37:26] <TrueBlueGuy> well, a while ago
[22:37:38] <taplar> something.name <-- what is name?
[22:37:44] <TrueBlueGuy> the key
[22:37:51] <TrueBlueGuy> something is the object
[22:37:55] <taplar> more than that, what is it?
[22:38:00] <TrueBlueGuy> what do you mean?
[22:38:02] <TrueBlueGuy> in what respect?
[22:38:11] <taplar> name there is the property on the object
[22:38:25] <taplar> it cannot be a varialbe
[22:38:28] <taplar> variable
[22:38:36] <TrueBlueGuy> hm
[22:38:44] <TrueBlueGuy> because objects don't have variables
[22:38:47] <TrueBlueGuy> they have characteristics
[22:38:48] <TrueBlueGuy> er
[22:38:51] <taplar> something["name"] <-- what is name there?
[22:38:51] <TrueBlueGuy> properties
[22:39:49] <TrueBlueGuy> I don't know what you're asking
[22:39:55] <TrueBlueGuy> like, what is it in my situation?
[22:40:05] <taplar> var x = "hey, welcome to my house!!!";  <-- what is x?
[22:40:11] <TrueBlueGuy> X is a string
[22:40:13] <taplar> boom
[22:40:19] <TrueBlueGuy> LOL that's what you wanted to know?
[22:40:23] <taplar> something["name"] <-- what is name?
[22:40:26] <TrueBlueGuy> Shit man I was worried about saying that a long time ago
[22:40:37] <TrueBlueGuy> well, as long as it's not a number
[22:40:40] <TrueBlueGuy> er, it could be, but non-numeric
[22:40:50] <TrueBlueGuy> then it'd be a string holding the information on the object
[22:40:51] <taplar> as i've typed it, what is name?
[22:40:53] <TrueBlueGuy> $(name)
[22:40:56] <TrueBlueGuy> like that then
[22:41:02] <TrueBlueGuy> Oh
[22:41:03] <taplar> no, your thinking to much about it
[22:41:10] <TrueBlueGuy> It's a key that holds the string
[22:41:18] <taplar> no, it IS a string
[22:41:24] <TrueBlueGuy> "name"?
[22:41:25] <taplar> "im a string, i have quotes"
[22:41:34] <taplar> 'i am also a string, i have single quotes'
[22:41:39] <TrueBlueGuy> okay
[22:41:47] <TrueBlueGuy> So I can convert this stuff into strings
[22:41:49] <TrueBlueGuy> er
[22:41:51] <TrueBlueGuy> other way around
[22:41:57] <TrueBlueGuy> I can convert strings into obj props
[22:42:02] <TrueBlueGuy> and then .css(props)
[22:42:14] <taplar> show me, :)
[22:42:17] <TrueBlueGuy> uh
[22:42:30] <TrueBlueGuy> okay
[22:42:46] <taplar> var x = "name"; <-- that's a string right?
[22:42:56] <TrueBlueGuy> right
[22:43:08] <taplar> something["name"] <-- that's using a string, right?
[22:43:11] <TrueBlueGuy> wait so
[22:43:20] <TrueBlueGuy> you said I'm not supposed to be using var anymore
[22:43:23] <TrueBlueGuy> how am I supposed to do that
[22:43:30] <taplar> no, use it, but forget that for now
[22:43:39] <TrueBlueGuy> okay, what do I do
[22:43:42] <TrueBlueGuy> here's what I have
[22:43:44] <taplar> something["name"] <-- that's using a string, right?
[22:43:49] <TrueBlueGuy> right
[22:43:51] <TrueBlueGuy> is there such thing as
[22:43:55] <TrueBlueGuy> something[name]
[22:43:57] <taplar> so why can't i do something[x] ?
[22:44:23] <TrueBlueGuy> props[x]?
[22:44:28] <taplar> why not?
[22:44:41] <taplar> it just needs a string, right?
[22:44:53] <TrueBlueGuy> But I'm not that far
[22:44:57] <taplar> you got key strings and value strings out the wazzo, right?
[22:45:22] <TrueBlueGuy> can I ask you something
[22:45:30] <TrueBlueGuy> props[conkey1] what is this
[22:45:33] <TrueBlueGuy> er
[22:45:36] <TrueBlueGuy> props[conKey1]
[22:45:52] <taplar> as it's written, your trying to access props with a variable of conKey1
[22:46:03] <TrueBlueGuy> okay hold please
[22:47:40] <TrueBlueGuy> How do I get them all
[22:47:42] <TrueBlueGuy> at the same time
[22:47:45] <taplar> you don't
[22:47:54] <taplar> one key and value at a time
[22:48:11] <TrueBlueGuy> ok
[22:48:14] <taplar> if you knew the keys ahead of time you could do them all at once, but your don't
[22:48:24] <taplar> s/your/you
[22:48:25] <b-ot> Correction, <taplar> if you knew the keys ahead of time you could do them all at once, but you don't
[22:49:38] <TrueBlueGuy> Well, if someone hits the button
[22:49:42] <TrueBlueGuy> Then I know them because they're in there
[22:49:47] <taplar> yep
[22:49:55] <TrueBlueGuy> So I -could- use them all at once
[22:49:59] <taplar> no
[22:50:02] <TrueBlueGuy> but fuck that, i'ma do the regular stuff
[22:50:04] <TrueBlueGuy> oh okay
[22:50:12] <taplar> you don't know if it's going to be height or width or display, or whatever
[22:50:20] <taplar> they can enter in whatever
[22:50:26] <TrueBlueGuy> im gonna give you something
[22:56:12] <TrueBlueGuy> Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[22:56:37] <TrueBlueGuy> Just want you to know I havne't forgotten about you; just addressing this issue
[22:57:43] <taplar> k, just curious.  you haven't shared an updated fiddle in a bit.
[22:58:24] <taplar> remember to start small.  don't try to pull in that big object you were trying to create earlier
[22:58:31] <TrueBlueGuy> I'm not
[22:58:40] <TrueBlueGuy> just the 1 key and 1 value, not even doing 2 et
[22:58:41] <TrueBlueGuy> yet*
[23:00:05] <TrueBlueGuy> hm, I remember 'make the object!' showing up in log
[23:00:08] <TrueBlueGuy> console log*
[23:00:13] <TrueBlueGuy> but I don't see the object values anymore
[23:00:23] <taplar> show me what you have now?
[23:01:33] <TrueBlueGuy> I want to
[23:01:43] <TrueBlueGuy> but I want to solve this before you see it
[23:01:47] <taplar> lol
[23:01:51] <TrueBlueGuy> I even tried it on yours
[23:01:58] <TrueBlueGuy> I used to be able to see the values, now I don't
[23:02:16] <TrueBlueGuy> there's no errors being thrown; just no object properties that I can see.Is this some setting in the browser?
[23:02:20] <taplar> i can't really help point you towards your error, if I can't see it, eh?
[23:02:30] <TrueBlueGuy> well, you can: i want you to go here
[23:03:20] <TrueBlueGuy> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2nm13r/1/
[23:03:36] <TrueBlueGuy> Can you see the thing I pasted beofre
[23:04:03] <taplar> yeah, that's an older fiddle though, i think
[23:04:22] <TrueBlueGuy> why is it not making an object?
[23:04:46] <TrueBlueGuy> i typed in 'typeof props' on that fiddle and it says 'undefined'
[23:04:51] <taplar> it is, your just not console.log() it
[23:05:12] <taplar> one sec
[23:05:15] <TrueBlueGuy> Got it!
[23:05:16] <TrueBlueGuy> console.log(props);
[23:05:51] <TrueBlueGuy> okay, it's back
[23:05:59] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2nm13r/8/
[23:06:55] <TrueBlueGuy> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2nm13r/9/
[23:07:14] <taplar> lol
[23:07:29] <taplar> conKey1 is not your key
[23:07:33] <taplar> "height" is
[23:07:36] <taplar> so is "width"
[23:07:49] <TrueBlueGuy> but I cant type in 'height' on there
[23:07:58] <TrueBlueGuy> because that'd defeat the purpose of the input
[23:08:05] <taplar> which goes back to me asking earlier of how would you get it
[23:08:14] <taplar> your not going to be putting these keys in the {}
[23:08:17] <TrueBlueGuy> props[conKey1]
[23:08:19] <taplar> your going to be adding them afterwards
[23:08:29] <taplar> no
[23:08:32] <TrueBlueGuy> oh
[23:08:33] <taplar> "height" is in your input
[23:08:40] <TrueBlueGuy> right
[23:08:43] <taplar> you have to get your key and value from the inputs for them
[23:09:11] <TrueBlueGuy> ok
[23:09:17] <TrueBlueGuy> conKey1 : $("#conKey1").val(),
[23:09:20] <TrueBlueGuy> With this then
[23:09:21] <taplar> no
[23:09:23] <taplar> lol
[23:09:27] <taplar> conKey1 is not the key
[23:09:27] <TrueBlueGuy> fuck
[23:09:31] <TrueBlueGuy> I know
[23:09:35] <TrueBlueGuy> you keep telling me
[23:09:47] <TrueBlueGuy> And I keep forgetting that lmao
[23:09:55] <TrueBlueGuy> But like
[23:09:57] <taplar> something.name
[23:10:03] <taplar> something["name"]
[23:10:06] <taplar> what's the key?
[23:10:07] <TrueBlueGuy> props[X] what's in there
[23:10:10] <TrueBlueGuy> what's the X then
[23:10:14] <taplar> a variable
[23:10:19] <taplar> it can be whatever
[23:10:20] <TrueBlueGuy> No
[23:10:21] <TrueBlueGuy> What's my X
[23:10:28] <taplar> "height" or "width"
[23:10:37] <TrueBlueGuy> fine
[23:10:37] <taplar> a variable containing one of those two
[23:10:39] <TrueBlueGuy> ill link it
[23:10:40] <TrueBlueGuy> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2nm13r/10/
[23:10:55] <taplar> no dude...
[23:10:55] <TrueBlueGuy> But you said that I shouldn't worry about using var and I should forget it for now
[23:11:11] <TrueBlueGuy> OH, dw, I know that fiddle is totally not right
[23:11:30] <taplar> go back here: https://jsfiddle.net/qs2nm13r/8/
[23:11:33] <TrueBlueGuy> Object {conKey1: "height", conVal1: "50em", conKey2: "c", conVal2: "d"}
[23:11:39] <TrueBlueGuy> That's what the console pulls up
[23:11:47] <taplar> right, which is incorrect
[23:11:53] <TrueBlueGuy> why?
[23:11:56] <TrueBlueGuy> I see height
[23:11:58] <TrueBlueGuy> and I see 50em
[23:12:08] <taplar> conKey1 is not a valid css key
[23:12:23] <TrueBlueGuy> Right, but how do I say the valid CSS key without saying it?
[23:12:25] <taplar> {height:"50em"}
[23:12:36] <TrueBlueGuy> Whats that
[23:12:41] <taplar> what you are after
[23:12:46] <taplar> height is the key
[23:12:50] <taplar> 50em is the value
[23:12:57] <TrueBlueGuy> can you show me how I implement it
[23:13:42] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qs2nm13r/11/
[23:14:01] <TrueBlueGuy> youve gotta be fucking kidding me
[23:14:13] <taplar> i kept poking you dude, :)
[23:14:19] <TrueBlueGuy> No
[23:14:20] <TrueBlueGuy> I mean
[23:14:22] <TrueBlueGuy> I've hit that like
[23:14:23] <TrueBlueGuy> 20 times
[23:14:27] <TrueBlueGuy> er, not 20, but a bunch
[23:14:34] <TrueBlueGuy> wtf why wouldnt it work before
[23:14:52] <taplar> were you trying to do it in between {} ?
[23:15:09] <TrueBlueGuy> Oh
[23:15:11] <taplar> cause remember i told you, you can't use variables as keys when declaring an object as {}
[23:15:12] <TrueBlueGuy> wtf why is that empty
[23:15:20] <TrueBlueGuy> but wait
[23:15:21] <taplar> that's the whole reason why we're using the [] notation
[23:15:23] <TrueBlueGuy> why is it there
[23:15:32] <taplar> what?
[23:15:38] <TrueBlueGuy> If it's empty, it's not saying anything
[23:15:43] <taplar> not yet
[23:15:45] <TrueBlueGuy> all it does is establish an empty variable, right?
[23:15:48] <taplar> your modifying it after the fact
[23:15:50] <taplar> yep
[23:16:08] <TrueBlueGuy> ok
[23:16:30] <TrueBlueGuy> I can't put that into a variable?
[23:16:38] <taplar> not in {}
[23:16:39] <sillyslux> you could do https://jsfiddle.net/etkmx6om/1/
[23:17:00] <taplar> wth
[23:17:02] <taplar> lmao
[23:17:07] <TrueBlueGuy> Thats what
[23:17:08] <TrueBlueGuy> Ive been
[23:17:10] <TrueBlueGuy> omfg
[23:17:10] <taplar> wow, didn't know you oculd do that
[23:17:18] <TrueBlueGuy> Fuck java
[23:17:21] <taplar> this isn't java
[23:17:22] <TrueBlueGuy> I dont even like coffee
[23:17:28] <sillyslux> just learned it myself the other day
[23:17:29] <TrueBlueGuy> it doesnt deserve to be called by its real name
[23:17:30] <taplar> o.o
[23:17:33] <taplar> not java
[23:17:36] <TrueBlueGuy> I know
[23:17:37] <TrueBlueGuy> js
[23:17:37] <taplar> can't say that enough
[23:17:41] <TrueBlueGuy> js =/= java
[23:17:45] <TrueBlueGuy> I know that, dw
[23:17:53] <TrueBlueGuy> but I used it as a nickname
[23:18:11] <TrueBlueGuy> I figured that you guys would know what I meant since i'm in a channel for a js library
[23:18:16] <taplar> nope
[23:18:39] <taplar> people get it confused sometimes.  bad nickname
[23:19:10] <TrueBlueGuy> lol
[23:19:14] <TrueBlueGuy> well thanks guys
[23:19:15] <taplar> but anyway, so yeah you can do it that way it seems.  though it is also a good idea that you get familiar with bracket notation too
[23:19:47] <TrueBlueGuy> okay
[23:19:54] <TrueBlueGuy> now, my goal was to style a div
[23:19:57] <TrueBlueGuy> based upon this
[23:20:01] <TrueBlueGuy> I can do .css(props)
[23:20:04] <taplar> yup
[23:20:05] <TrueBlueGuy> right?
[23:20:13] <TrueBlueGuy> FUCK YEAH BITCHES I GOT ONE
[23:22:12] <taplar> ugh, i'm fixing to crash
[23:22:25] <TrueBlueGuy> https://jsfiddle.net/etkmx6om/2/
[23:22:30] <TrueBlueGuy> Thanks guys
[23:23:07] <TrueBlueGuy> I'm not full confident with it yet, but I now have something to refer to that will help me do this.
[23:23:16] <taplar> yep.  remember to checkout that codecademy site, and also maybe hitup ##javascript about good tutorial sites
[23:23:22] <TrueBlueGuy> I think I'm going to make another project for myself; something a bit more involved.
[23:23:30] <TrueBlueGuy> I'll definitely do that taplar
[23:23:33] <TrueBlueGuy> thanks sillyslux
[23:23:41] <taplar> there is also http://try.jquery.com/ for jquery
[23:23:53] <TrueBlueGuy> noted.
[23:24:01] <taplar> learning the nuts and bolts of js will help you before you go into jquery though
[23:24:14] <TrueBlueGuy> okay.
[23:24:33] <TrueBlueGuy> I need to go. My gf is yelling at me because I haven't slept in 2 days
[23:24:45] <TrueBlueGuy> Sorry. I'll try to see if I can sign on tomorrow.
[23:24:53] <taplar> s'all good
[23:44:38] <Fritx> What's the best approach to learn javascript ??
[23:45:11] <Fritx> I just seem to have hit a plateau, as if I am going to always be below average in JS
