[00:00:52] <xec> what are you *really* trying to do?
[00:03:27] <Snoopal> hey guys. i want to use jquery ui with effect "slide" so that it slides from the left to the right. but i canÂ´t find syntax how to setup direction correctly? $('.slider:first').effect('slide','slow'); <- but where do i put the direction?
[00:04:41] <xec> ?xy @ __machine
[00:05:28] <Snoopal> ok forget it. got the solution :)
[00:05:43] <xec> __machine: the bot doesn't like me it appears, see http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem
[00:11:15] <__machine> xec: my actual problem is... im trying to follow redirects on cross origin ajax requests... this doesnt seem to work... so in my backend server for ajax requests i am converting redirect responses to 200 OK responses with the location header as json data...
[00:12:10] <Cork> __machine: redirects should be handled by the browser naively, before your callback fires
[00:12:37] <__machine> xec: so in my success handlers i want to call a function like.. redirect(data, textStatus, jqXHR) ... and have it make a new synchroneous ajax GET request for the target URL and alter `data` in place... so that my handler function gets the json data from the redirect target endpoint
[00:12:47] <__machine> Cork: they are not, for CORS requests
[00:12:56] <Cork> wow...
[00:13:07] <Cork> cross browsers?
[00:13:18] <__machine> yes... safari, chrome, firefox
[00:13:32] <Cork> that.... sounds like a spec bug...
[00:13:35] <__machine> i found a few stack exchange questions detailing the same problem but no answers
[00:15:28] <__machine> ive read as much of the spec as i could find that seemed relevant... but it was pretty dry reading and i didnt find a tonne of clarity in the spec specifically for redirects... e.g. domain A does POST to domain B which returns a 302 redirect to another page on domain B ...
[00:15:42] <Cork> __machine: http://blog.dzhuvinov.com/?p=979
[00:16:24] <Cork> __machine: so it sounds like it should work as long as the servers are configured correctly
[00:16:29] <__machine> Cork: my 302 response does have the correct headers
[00:16:39] <anli_> Using .dataTable, is there some kind of callback where I can set the class of a whole tr?
[00:18:10] <Cork> __machine: are you handling the options verb too?
[00:18:49] <__machine> Cork: yes... preflighted requests are working... just not redirect is not being followed
[00:18:58] <Cork> very interesting
[00:19:06] <Cork> need to fiddle with this when i get home...
[00:20:26] <__machine> in chrome network tab, i dont even see the 302 response... even though the backend server logs it and i have inspected it in ipdb (its a django backend) to verify its headers and content... in firefox tab i see the 302 response, but jquery does not follow it
[00:21:31] <__machine> seems weird that both firefox and chrome would misinterpret the spec this way or have the same buggy behaviour... i read the xhr and cors specs and it wasn't 100% clear to me if this should work
[00:23:38] <Cork> __machine: from a quick googling it definitely looks like ppl have been getting it to work
[00:23:48] <Cork> but i've never needed to do it my self, so can't say for sure
[00:26:08] <__machine> it might be because i am doing "not simple" cors requests (requiring preflight request, because i am using withCredentials: true)... but i have also tried without... i have also try synchroneous and asynchroneous
[00:29:29] <dopie> How would i do .... <div id="slider.name" class="caption">
[00:29:40] <dopie> in a each loop
[00:31:20] <Cork> dopie: not sure what that question means
[00:31:26] <Cork> in what situation
[00:32:02] <dopie> Cork sorry
[00:32:04] <dopie> wrong area
[00:32:04] <dopie> :)
[00:42:10] <eeezkil> is this the right place to ask questions about jqueryui
[00:45:23] <Cork> eeezkil: yes
[00:48:07] <eeezkil> I was just playing around with the dialog from jqueryui
[00:48:09] <eeezkil> and it works fine
[00:48:16] <__machine> cork: here's an SO post about the problem, and no solution... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14531515/jquery-cors-and-redirects ... initially the asker thought it was resolved by not using access-control-allow-origin: * (you must use an actual origin, not *), but after testing with different domains it still doesnt work...
[00:48:41] <eeezkil> but when I use it in another environment it behaves oddly
[00:48:42] <Cork> __machine: ya, so is well as it is, so i normally look for better sources
[00:49:03] <eeezkil> when you try to move the dialog the vertical position doubles
[00:49:11] <eeezkil> every time you try to move it
[00:49:25] <eeezkil> for example if it starts off at top:2
[00:49:26] <Cork> eeezkil: "another environment"?
[00:49:35] <eeezkil> some web app
[00:49:50] <Cork> ok, have you checked so you don't have a conflicting lib somewhere?
[00:49:52] <eeezkil> it starts off at top:2 on the 1st move it gets top:4
[00:49:53] <eeezkil> and so on
[00:49:56] <eeezkil> 16
[00:49:58] <dopie> has anyone here used CKeditor??
[00:50:09] <eeezkil> that might be the case..
[00:50:15] <Cork> dopie: ys, but it is offtopic for this channel
[00:50:17] <doug65536> __machine: is your server apache? you can rewrite the headers to specify the origin as the allowed origin
[00:50:21] <dopie> oh...
[00:50:30] <dopie> well i was wondering how would i do the ajax call to save
[00:50:33] <eeezkil> so what are the minimum requirements
[00:50:37] <eeezkil> for the dialog
[00:50:50] <eeezkil> jquery.js and jqueryui.js?
[00:50:50] <eeezkil> right
[00:50:52] <Cork> eeezkil: minimum requirements?
[00:51:06] <Cork> eeezkil: yes, jquery ui depends on jquery
[00:51:22] <eeezkil> is it possible that it's a version problem
[00:51:24] <__machine> doug65536: not apache... just using the local django development server for now... but the header is correct... i am not using * like in that SO question... i am using the actual origin... so nothing to rewrite...
[00:51:31] <Cork> the dialogs depends on jquery, core mouse resizable and dialog
[00:52:11] <eeezkil> Cork: are they all in jquery.js
[00:52:12] <eeezkil> ?
[00:52:28] <Cork> no
[00:52:42] <Cork> jquery.js is just jquery
[00:54:22] <doug65536> don't you love it when your javascript hangs/crashes chrome. what a piece of crap
[00:55:36] <doug65536> I also love how reload and hard reload don't work or malfunction when your code is frozen in the debugger
[00:57:24] <doug65536> killall -9 chrome ftw
[00:57:25] <dopie> Cork i need help with doing  a ajax call
[00:57:52] <Cork> doug65536: can't say that has happended to me much
[00:58:11] <Cork> dopie: ajax should be simple enough
[00:58:15] <doug65536> pushState etc destabilizes chrome for me
[00:58:23] <Cork> ?api post @ dopie
[00:58:23] <b-ot> dopie: No matches.
[00:58:27] <Cork> ...
[00:58:29] <Cork> ?api post

[00:58:35] <Cork> O_o

[00:58:38] <dopie> ?#!
[00:58:40] * Cork kicks b-ot 
[00:58:57] <Cork> ha, right
[00:59:00] * doug65536 gave up on b-ot showing api stuff
[00:59:03] <Cork> ?api jquery.post @ dopie
[00:59:04] <b-ot> dopie: jQuery.post(): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[00:59:26] <dopie> wtf?!
[01:02:25] <grafi> poor doug65536
[01:02:36] <grafi> b-ot doesnt like him
[01:03:00] <Cork> well i have to a agree the new bot is a poor replacement for bot-t
[01:03:35] <dopie> Cork,
[01:03:35] <dopie> http://pastie.org/8366274
[01:03:36] <dopie> ?
[01:03:54] <Cork> no
[01:04:01] <Cork> did you read the link i linked to?
[01:05:41] <dopie> yeah i did
[01:06:46] <Cork> so what you want is something like $.post('your-url-to-the-server-resource', { key_for_the_data: data })
[01:06:58] <__machine> Cork: doug65536: here are the request/response headers reported by firebug... its returning a 302 response with a location header and cors headers... but jquery is not following the redirect... http://pastebin.com/rmBjErYb
[01:07:05] <Cork> possibly with a .done/.fail deferred if you want the info
[01:08:14] <eeezkil> Cork: just to test it out.. the dialog works fine.. but when I try to bind it to an element of a function that's called from xajax it behaves oddly
[01:08:39] <Cork> eeezkil: you have to look into what the extra framework your using does
[01:08:58] <eeezkil> it's legacy..
[01:09:09] <Cork> well you still have to look into it :)
[01:09:18] <eeezkil> thank you mate
[01:10:56] <Cork> eeezkil: the style and look of jquery is almost exclusively done through the jqueryui.css and company
[01:11:22] <Cork> eeezkil: so you need to check and make sure you don't get extra css rules matching, or extra classes/inline style added to the elements
[01:11:30] <eeezkil> exactly..
[01:11:44] <eeezkil> I have the feeling that someone at some point modified some of those..
[01:11:56] <eeezkil> Cork: thank you
[01:12:40] <mokush> does anybody know if qunit does not load any styles for the elements in the #qunit-fixture? I'm getting blank for all the properties in element.style, for anything in qunit-fixture, even if they have styles set.
[01:16:36] <doug65536> __machine: the spec is explicit that you can't use * if allow credentials is true, so that SO answer is correct, see http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#resource-requests That's not your problem, just letting you know
[01:17:06] <lemonsparrow> is there a way i can make this function shorter https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6760771 I mean less number of lines of code ... thanks
[01:17:41] <__machine> doug65536: in the comment the guy says changing "*" to an actual origin didnt actually fix the problem (when sending request to a different domain name, not just a different port number)
[01:21:38] <doug65536> __machine: ok, but the answer is still correct - that you can't use * if the response has allow credentials
[01:23:20] <doug65536> __machine: I was looking through the maze of a spec and found that a 302 in a preflight seems to say to treat it as an error
[01:24:04] <phillip> Hi. Is it allowed to ask questions about jQuery plugins here?
[01:24:26] <doug65536> __machine: http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/#preflight-request 7.1.5
[01:24:44] <doug65536> __machine: "Apply the cache and network error steps."
[01:25:07] <phillip> I got problems with the select2 plugin
[01:25:20] <doug65536> __machine: digging around for that, I found a site that claims that setting a header on the xhr will cause a preflight
[01:26:07] <doug65536> __machine: on your server, you should check for the request method being OPTIONS, and don't redirect in that case, to get past the preflight
[01:29:30] <__machine> doug65536: should i be able to see the OPTIONS request in the network tab in chrome or firefox? i dont see it... does that mean the request is not being preflighted? even though i am setting an additional x-requested-with header?
[01:30:40] <doug65536> __machine: I doubt preflights will show up in the debugger. I've never seen one anyway
[01:30:53] <__machine> they should show up in the web server log though?
[01:31:12] <doug65536> __machine: maybe. depends on how verbose it is logging I guess
[01:31:21] <doug65536> __machine: what language is server code?
[01:32:36] <erry> are the default swatches for jquery mobile shown somewhere? Like when it says data-theme="c"
[01:32:39] <doug65536> __machine: REQUEST_METHOD will be options in $_SERVER for PHP, or that env var in cgi
[01:32:44] <doug65536> sorry, OPTIONS
[01:34:37] <doug65536> __machine: i.e. if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] !== 'OPTIONS') { .. do your redirect ... } else { ... say 200 OK ...  }
[01:46:48] <doug65536> why would an anchor like this: <a href="#">...</a> cause the page to load and the address to set to /#
[01:47:09] <doug65536> domain.com/#
[01:47:19] <Cork> doug65536: it shouldn't
[01:47:25] <doug65536> that's what I thought
[01:47:30] <Cork> # should never be sent to the server (unless it's escaped)
[01:47:46] <Cork> though you really shouldn't use href="#"
[01:48:08] <doug65536> 'a' requires href, right?
[01:48:22] <Cork> you should only use a for links
[01:48:27] <doug65536> and it's good for accessibility to put a clickable thing as an a, right?
[01:48:32] <Cork> no
[01:48:40] <Cork> it should be a link if it is a link
[01:48:52] <doug65536> what do you propose for a menu then
[01:48:53] <Cork> use aria and any normal element
[01:49:09] <Cork> doug65536: if it is an url use a if it isn't use span or li
[01:49:19] <doug65536> that isn't a tabstop
[01:49:33] <Cork> what?
[01:50:15] <doug65536> you can't "tab through" li or span
[01:50:20] <Cork> ?g aria menu
[01:50:20] <b-ot> Cork: Aria - New York Restaurant - MenuPages Italian, Wine Bar ... â http://www.menupages.com/restaurants/aria/
[01:50:35] <Cork> doug65536: a won't make it accessible unless it is a link
[01:50:48] <Cork> if you really care about accessibility use aria
[01:50:49] <doug65536> it is a link, #
[01:50:55] <Cork> and that is a broken link
[01:50:59] <doug65536> that's the reasoning
[01:51:16] <Cork> so # won't make it accessible at all
[01:51:26] <Cork> so; again, don't use a for click actions
[01:51:53] <Cork> uh opps wrong link
[01:51:58] <Cork> doug65536: http://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/wiki/Using_ARIA_menus
[01:53:07] <jop008> Is there a routine to check for dutch postal code?
[01:53:40] <jop008> the format is [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] space 2 letters
[01:53:43] <doug65536> jop008: a regex would be my first guess
[01:54:15] <jop008> Oke is there a site where you can fill in your format and then the regexp as a return?
[01:54:27] <doug65536> jop008: 1 sec
[01:55:44] <doug65536> jop008: /^\d{4}\s[a-zA-Z]{2}$/.test("1234 AA")
[01:55:52] <doug65536> js> /^\d{4}\s[a-zA-Z]{2}$/.test("1234 AA")
[01:55:57] <b-ot> doug65536: No output.
[01:56:03] <doug65536> js> print(/^\d{4}\s[a-zA-Z]{2}$/.test("1234 AA"))
[01:56:09] <b-ot> doug65536: true
[01:56:15] <doug65536> js> print(/^\d{4}\s[a-zA-Z]{2}$/.test("12345 AA"))
[01:56:21] <b-ot> doug65536: false
[01:57:19] <doug65536> jop008: I made it strict, you should $.trim(post) and use that, and pass that to the regex test
[01:57:48] <doug65536> jop008: so excess leading/trailing spaces will be dropped in your database and when testing
[01:58:55] <jop008> okay
[01:59:22] <jop008> the postal code had 4 digits and a space and 2 letters
[01:59:41] <jop008> it retusn falls I see
[01:59:52] <doug65536> what? 5 digits returned false
[02:00:29] <jop008> You showed the usage and 5 digtis is false
[02:00:41] <doug65536> <jop008> the format is [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] [0-9] space 2 letters
[02:00:56] <doug65536> I count 4 in your statement
[02:00:57] <jop008> Yes you regexp is fine
[02:01:01] <jop008> thx
[02:01:04] <doug65536> np
[02:03:28] <doug65536> why does b-ot emit "No output' in that case, but if you do var x = 1; print(x);   it emits undefined; console output: 1   makes no sense at all
[02:11:20] <Qantourisc> Is there a "prev-start-with child" ?
[02:13:49] <Qantourisc> Hmmm think I found a "better" way
[02:24:49] <M3kH> Good Morning!
[02:30:19] <Cork> doug65536: b-ot only outputs what's in print()
[02:40:01] <grafi> js> print("grafi is great!");
[02:40:41] <b-ot> grafi: grafi is great!
[02:40:48] <grafi> thanks b-ot
[02:54:02] <supe> hi
[02:54:08] <supe> Why aren't events being bound in my simple JQuery code? - http://pastebin.com/24J6q5G0
[02:55:16] <loin> hi guys, i want to do a jQuery('#procedureX53-content tr').each(function (i, row) {
[02:55:46] <loin> but i want only the top level trs, for instance, if a tr has a table as a child, i want that child to be ignored
[02:56:57] <grafi> tables in tables in tables in tables oÃ´
[02:57:50] <loin> grafi: helpful
[02:57:56] <grafi> not very
[03:00:32] <Cork> supe: why are you going the long way around document.getElementsByClass?
[03:01:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi
[03:01:29] <Cork> supe: also you need to bind the event handler on the video tag i think, i don't think ended bubbles
[03:01:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a bunch of vars (containing ajax calls) that are used in .done();
[03:01:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but some of these variables are arrays of ajaxcalls
[03:01:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> is this possible?
[03:02:35] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: yes, but you would have to make sure the other ajax calls has ended before your main ajax call happens
[03:02:44] <jkarsrud> Does anyone know if it's possible to make the UI spinner add the spinner step instead of increasing the value the next step?
[03:03:17] <jkarsrud> If I have a value of 0.10, and I have 0.25 as the step increment, the value should be 0.35, not 0.25 when you step up
[03:03:18] <Cork> loin: $('#procedureX53-content > tbody > tr')
[03:03:18] <jkarsrud> ?
[03:04:16] <supe> Cork: So ended doesn't go up to the parent?
[03:04:34] <Cork> supe: i don't think it bubbles ya
[03:07:12] <jkarsrud> I'm thinking I might have to hook onto the spin event and set the new value myself, but it would make sense if the widget handled that instead?
[03:08:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If one of those ajax call contains a link to a file that doesn't exists, how to avoid that the returndata contains this error message?
[03:09:02] <supe> Cork: Changing it to `vid0.children().bind('ended', function() {` worked
[03:09:04] <supe> Thanks
[03:09:18] <Cork> uh...
[03:09:26] <Cork> MAN what a hacky solution...
[03:17:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Is there a way to check if a file exists, without reading all its content?
[03:18:11] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: only if the web server provides a way
[03:18:21] <Cork> like /exists.php
[03:18:28] <loin> thanks Cork
[03:18:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a dynamic set of json urls and some might not exist
[03:18:59] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I  have an array of vars containing these ajaxcalls
[03:19:04] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: web don't have files
[03:19:09] <Cork> systems have files
[03:19:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> then they're all executed at once in done()
[03:19:21] <Cork> web have resources, and when you request a resource it is sent to you
[03:19:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[03:20:00] <Cork> though if the resource doesn't exist a 404 check should handle that
[03:20:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Can I show you the code in PM?
[03:20:41] <Cork> no
[03:26:33] <doug65536> Cork: so what you meant earlier was, just use an appropriate tag like li or span, but add role="menuitem" to it?
[03:26:45] <Cork> doug65536: yes
[03:26:51] <doug65536> great. thanks
[03:26:58] <Cork> and tabstop if you want it focusable like a <a> tag
[03:27:09] <doug65536> ok
[03:27:10] <Cork> leave links as links
[03:39:07] <MiKiOnEs> hey, how set slide back on $mobile.changepage() ? on <a> is a data-direction="reverse"
[03:40:14] <MiKiOnEs> oh just found it ..
[03:57:56] <dopie> hey Cork
[03:58:00] <dopie> im still stuck
[03:58:01] <dopie> :/
[03:58:02] <dopie> https://gist.github.com/staycreativedesign/6762188
[03:58:53] <Cork> uh
[03:59:05] <Cork> that's the same code you showed the first time
[03:59:17] <dopie> I know
[03:59:20] <dopie> i dont know what to do
[03:59:22] <Thoams> Insert joke about corkscrew here.
[03:59:43] <Cork> Thoams: cork it
[03:59:53] <xec> Cork: screw it
[03:59:53] <Thoams> Haa...
[04:01:08] <dopie> suck it??
[04:01:10] <dopie> hahahahahaha
[04:01:28] <Cork> uh...
[04:03:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> grr my callback param value contains an object with key responseText and a value for it and when I do console.log(v.responseText) it says undefined!
[04:04:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> console.log(v) list the object fine with all properties
[04:04:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why is v.responseText then undefined??
[04:04:34] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: are you sure it is an object and not a string?
[04:04:41] <doug65536> ecky--ptang-zoob: hard to believe
[04:05:10] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: also check so it isn't an array of objects or something like that
[04:05:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yes, because when i do v.readyState, it says 1!
[04:05:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> firebug says Object {...}
[04:05:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> when I log v
[04:05:59] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: then case check the key
[04:06:09] <Cork> and make sure nothing else is in there
[04:06:14] <Cork> (like space)
[04:06:32] <Cork> also you might have gc killing something cause of scope
[04:06:49] <Cork> it isn't common, but it does happen in some cases
[04:08:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Look: T
[04:08:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://pastebin.com/7vPPXyT5
[04:08:39] <Cork> don't see any trace of responseText in there
[04:09:07] <Cork> but yes, codes is an array of objects
[04:09:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it's there
[04:09:41] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: try to reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle
[04:09:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> When i click the object, it says http://pastebin.com/i1Af2Gpy
[04:10:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> But what's weird is that when I log it, the readyState says 1
[04:10:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> when I click the object in firebug
[04:10:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> the readystate says 4
[04:11:01] <Cork> ya, cause you watch the element after it's been modified
[04:11:17] <Cork> *object
[04:19:15] <jkarsrud> Anyone know if this is possible? http://jsbin.com/INeHaLi/2
[04:19:51] <jkarsrud> Or if I have to fix it with hooking on to the spin event?
[04:21:51] <Cork> jkarsrud: don't think so, you most likely need to fiddle with the spin event
[04:22:14] <jkarsrud> meh :(
[04:23:33] <jkarsrud> no biggie, was just hoping it supported it out of the box :)
[04:24:21] <Cork> jkarsrud: you could always file a bug and add a patch :)
[04:24:31] <jkarsrud> yep, I'm considering it :)
[04:25:27] <jkarsrud> but I guess I'll fix the issue first
[04:30:09] <rabbi1> Hi, i have .json file in my local system, and i am working locally. how can i append this json data to my jquery function, so that i can use to populate a div with the json data
[04:32:18] <Cork> rabbi1: add it inline in the html file
[04:32:30] <Cork> (ajax doesn't work locally)
[04:33:18] <rabbi1> Cork: or better for now, i can just call with script tag. if i did, how can i use it to append further
[04:33:32] <Cork> rabbi1: you can't
[04:34:06] <rabbi1> Cork: ok, assign it to a variable is the only better solution ?
[04:34:22] <Cork> it's the only solution when you run from file://
[04:34:34] <rabbi1> Cork: thanks
[04:34:50] <Cork> rabbi1: your better of running a small webserver, and get the standard commands to your disposal
[04:35:33] <xec> you're
[04:35:37] <anew> http://pastebin.com/5Ss5pP7X can someone explain this to me
[04:35:42] <anew> bottom is my external js file
[04:35:47] <anew> but when i view source what i see is the top
[04:35:59] <anew> i can see 'ready' in the console, but not 'timeago'
[04:36:24] <rabbi1> Cork: yeah, but that's not required as of now, this is only for a demo purposeâ¦. that's cool with me
[04:36:29] <Cork> anew: is the top and the bottom section meant to be the same thing?
[04:36:42] <anew> the bottom is my .js file
[04:36:45] <Cork> rabbi1: well setting up a server is a few seconds
[04:36:45] <anew> when i view in my browser
[04:36:48] <anew> and view source
[04:37:09] <Cork> so you have one script tag and one script file
[04:37:13] <anew> i see the top where <script src="/js/my-built.js"></script> is supposed to be
[04:37:22] <Cork> and the script tag doesn'
[04:37:28] <Cork> *'t contain timago
[04:37:32] <anew> in my source i have <script src="/js/my-built.js"></script>... the contents of this file are the bottom
[04:37:40] <anew> but when i compile in browser
[04:37:45] <anew> and i view source, what i see is that top
[04:37:57] <Cork> then your compiler is removing things
[04:38:01] <Cork> or using an old cache
[04:38:08] <anew> my compiler is chrome !
[04:38:18] <Cork> uh... no
[04:38:18] <anew> hmm could be old cache
[04:38:21] <anew> let me see
[04:38:26] <anew> yeah the browser is a js compiler
[04:38:40] <Cork> it doens't compile js files into <script> tags no
[04:38:52] <anew> obv, it compiles what's inside them
[04:39:06] <Cork> no if anything it jit's it
[04:39:15] <Cork> but that doesn't normally matter for your case
[04:39:18] <anew> yeah still same thing
[04:39:20] <Cork> as it isn't visible
[04:39:20] <anew> cleared cache
[04:39:21] <Cork> no
[04:39:23] <Cork> it isn't
[04:39:33] <anew> no i refreshed and it's still the same thing
[04:39:35] <anew> not what ur talking about
[04:39:38] <Cork> the jit is internal in the browser
[04:39:44] <Cork> you never see or experience it
[04:39:49] <Cork> only the speed effect from it
[04:40:04] <anew> the browser compiles what is inside your js files so you can see it
[04:40:08] <Cork> no
[04:40:09] <sunbeam> whats the best way to check whether firefox is displaying zoomed?
[04:40:16] <sunbeam> or event prevent zooming?
[04:40:19] <Cork> anew: what you see in the browser is text
[04:40:24] <sunbeam> (CTRL+SCROLL)
[04:40:37] <Cork> sunbeam: through script you mean?
[04:41:08] <Cork> anew: if what the browser showed you was compiled you wouldn't be able to read it
[04:41:09] <anew> https://code.google.com/p/v8/
[04:41:23] <Cork> anew: ya?
[04:41:26] <anew> if chrome didnt compile your js you wouldnt see anything
[04:41:31] <sunbeam> Cork: yes
[04:41:32] <Cork> no
[04:41:32] <anew> or any browser for that matter
[04:41:36] <Cork> no
[04:41:37] <anew> yes
[04:41:39] <Cork> no
[04:41:48] <anew> so where does it magically get compiled
[04:41:51] <Cork> anew: your mixing up terminology
[04:41:55] <anew> before it reaches your browser?
[04:42:03] <Cork> it is never compiled
[04:42:05] <sunbeam> Cork: any idea how i can do this?
[04:42:06] <Cork> it's parsed
[04:42:13] <Cork> it's scripting, not machine code
[04:42:34] <Cork> anew: when the browser parses the script (text) it jit compiles parts that it things will run again
[04:42:40] <anew> "V8 compiles JavaScript to native machine code (IA-32, x86-64, ARM, or MIPS CPUs)[3][6] before executing it"
[04:42:41] <Cork> to make it run faster the next time it's needed
[04:42:46] <Cork> yes
[04:42:51] <Cork> but that happens when it parses it
[04:42:52] <anew> keyword there - COMPILE
[04:42:56] <Cork> ...
[04:43:12] <Cork> anew: read up on how it works before you argue about it...
[04:43:28] <anew> i mean ur arguing with the definition lol
[04:43:33] <Cork> no
[04:43:38] <anew> v8 js engine is in the chrome web browser
[04:43:42] <anew> v8 COMPILES js
[04:43:43] <Cork> your saying that what the browser shows you is compiled js
[04:43:44] <Cork> and it isn't
[04:43:46] <anew> before executing it
[04:43:56] <Cork> cause if it was you would see machine code or llvm
[04:44:02] <Cork> it isn't readable
[04:44:16] <anew> i mean it's two sentences... compiles then executes
[04:44:17] <Cork> what you see is the original text, and the browser is often using that script
[04:44:20] <Cork> no
[04:44:21] <anew> ok ur right, wikipedia is wrong
[04:44:31] <Cork> jit is compiling when the parser reads the script
[04:44:36] <anew> anyway i'm not sure why my view source is not showing properly here
[04:44:51] <Cork> anew: cause your server is sending the top part
[04:44:57] <Cork> don't blame the browser
[04:45:09] <anew> sending which top pat
[04:45:10] <anew> part
[04:45:50] <Cork> anew: something is inlining the script in the page
[04:45:57] <Cork> and that isn't using the new file
[04:46:02] <anew> yeah it was cache problem and modspeed
[04:46:04] <Cork> most likely cause of a cache
[04:46:04] <anew> got it working now
[04:46:07] <Cork> server side
[04:46:36] <anew> thx
[04:47:05] <anew> i thought if i added query strings after the url it wont cache it
[04:47:11] <anew> my.js?1234
[04:47:24] <anew> or does what comes after have to be constantly changing
[04:47:52] <Cork> that is to circumvent the BROWSERS cache ya
[04:47:59] <Cork> not the servers cache code
[04:48:22] <anew> yes
[04:52:21] <Asmoooh> is it me or cant i post from a popup to a file?
[04:53:40] <Cork> Asmoooh: what?
[04:53:52] <Cork> to what file, where?
[04:54:31] <sunbeam> whats the best way to check whether firefox is displaying zoomed?
[04:54:39] <Asmoooh> to /checklogin.php
[04:54:51] <Cork> sunbeam: through script or what?
[04:54:57] <duderion> sunbeam: press ctrl+0
[04:55:06] <Cork> Asmoooh: and what is the popup?
[04:55:09] <duderion> ah you mean in script
[04:55:10] <Asmoooh> wait
[04:55:14] <Asmoooh> http://www.iewmail.com/index.php
[04:55:19] <Asmoooh> click on login
[04:55:29] <Asmoooh> that popup
[04:56:05] <sunbeam> duderion: thanks, that is the real size?
[04:56:11] <sunbeam> Cork: duderion i also ment in script yes
[04:56:45] <duderion> sunbeam: jep, ctrl zero resets the size to 100%
[04:56:59] <Cork> sunbeam: you can't
[04:56:59] <sunbeam> duderion: great!! is there a way I can force my sites viewers to view the page in that size?
[04:57:19] <Cork> sunbeam: script isn't allowed to fiddle with zoom in firefox
[04:57:33] <duderion> hmm
[04:58:00] <Cork> sunbeam: you really shouldn't do that
[04:58:12] <Cork> you should build the site to handle it, not force the user
[05:00:38] <usc911> Hey guys, any way to add a blinking cursor after a placeholder within a input field? cheers
[05:01:04] <Cork> usc911: that is up to the browser
[05:01:24] <Cork> usc911: if you want more control you would have to stop using the placeholder
[05:01:32] <anew> whats jquery.min.map
[05:01:37] <anew> my site keeps requesting it
[05:01:44] <Asmoooh> hmm... for some reason if i have a form within a popup it does not do anything, it goes to the file but the file is empty..
[05:01:45] <usc911> Cork: ok cheers, any suggestions?
[05:02:04] <usc911> Cork: unfortunately both need to be there
[05:02:05] <Cork> anew: it is the resource used to deminify the minified scripts
[05:02:25] <anew> hmmm so u need to download something to deminify
[05:02:25] <Cork> anew: you can find the file in code.jquery.com/jquery.min.map
[05:02:28] <anew> i guess it must be worth it
[05:02:45] <Cork> anew: no you don't you just need to hows it on the server
[05:02:52] <anew> hows it ?
[05:03:08] <Cork> i don't normally use the minified version
[05:03:13] <anew> o rly
[05:03:16] <anew> why
[05:03:18] <anew> what is the benefit
[05:03:19] <Cork> my server minify all scripts when i publish the site
[05:03:35] <Cork> so no point in having parts pre minified
[05:03:41] <Cork> it just makes the site harder to debug
[05:03:42] <anew> you dirty bird
[05:03:54] <duderion> sunbeam: currently impossible
[05:06:26] <duderion> sunbeam: perhaps this one: https://gist.github.com/chrismbarr/1059295
[05:07:01] <Cork> duderion: does only work in older webkit versions
[05:07:08] <duderion> k
[05:07:27] <Cork> but really, you should not restrict the user
[05:07:33] <duderion> nope
[05:07:35] <duderion> thats right
[05:07:45] <Cork> especially on zoom
[05:18:50] <sunbeam> Cork: duderion thanks a lot!
[05:26:56] <Silex> hi, I have a pretty stupid problem: I have a .hover() method to fadein/fadeout image A on top of image B. It works well, except when I move the cursor on the image A, it triggers the fadeout
[05:27:11] <Silex> it's all pretty logical but I'm not sure what would be the best way to avoid it
[05:27:34] <Silex> (the fadein/out is set on image B)
[05:30:10] <rabbi1> Cork: u there ?
[05:30:39] <rabbi1> any optimisation suggestion to this ? http://pastebin.com/xieT6jA2
[05:31:53] <dwarder> guys, i need to Ajax POST my data to another domain ...
[05:32:15] <dwarder> what are the dirtiest hacks you know?
[05:38:54] <rosco_y> is this assignment valid:  var anchor = "<a href=\"" + url.val() + "\" page=\"blank\">" + link.val() + "</a>";   (It doesn't seem to work for me here: http://jsfiddle.net/4UL9p/5/  -- line 15
[06:05:49] <BullsEye> hello!!..I have to enlarge an image when the move is over a small image for 2 seconds. The small image is in div. I am planning to start the counter when mouse enter div and trigger enlarge image if mouse dont leave div for 2 sec.
[06:06:04] <BullsEye> I need help to make this happen.Plz help
[06:06:23] <BullsEye> if there is any other easy way to do this please suggest.
[06:10:21] <sammich> BullsEye: use a lightbox plugin, then just trigger the open method on it
[06:11:24] <rosco_y> Can anyone suggest a way to pass the string values I collect in this dialog to PHP?  http://jsfiddle.net/4UL9p/5/
[06:13:19] <BullsEye> thank you sammich .. let me check this..
[06:14:19] <stiki101> Anyone awake at this hour?
[06:15:38] <rosco_y> Huh!  Wha?  I'm awake!!
[06:15:39] <sammich> I'm sure at least 2/3 of the planet is
[06:16:11] <sammich> so that's about 4.5 billion people
[06:16:20] <stiki101> I should have been more specific.. hehe
[06:32:02] <FuryFoo> Hu everyone - I'm trying to have a function cycle trough several sections .
[06:32:02] <FuryFoo> In each section is scans for certain classes , measures them , calculates a margin-left for the elements and then it applies it.
[06:32:02] <FuryFoo> However for the class .square - the results are chaotic. Something went haywire and I don't know why . Any ideas are welcomed .
[06:32:02] <FuryFoo> Here's the code in question : http://pastebin.com/E1XiqetY
[06:32:02] <FuryFoo> And here is the result : http://tinyurl.com/lwkax6v
[06:32:08] <FuryFoo> Please help
[06:35:07] <Cork> FuryFoo: reproduce the problem in jsfiddle.net
[06:39:13] <xec> you're using javascript to center content?
[06:40:47] <FuryFoo> @Xec Yes
[06:41:08] <xec> why
[06:41:39] <FuryFoo> Because the number of images and sections is variable so CSS isn't gonna cut it.
[06:41:54] <Cork> css CAN do that
[06:41:59] <Cork> it's called the @media query
[06:42:20] <xec> i'm actually convinced you don't even need media queries
[06:42:32] <Cork> prob ya
[06:43:15] <FuryFoo> The number of images per row variates  , so does the size of the image . I'm already using queries to control the size of the images.
[06:43:59] <FuryFoo> However alignment is something CSS can't do at a decent level .
[06:44:26] <xec> or you're doing it wrong :) can you make a small jsfiddle with some content you're unable to center?
[06:44:58] <xec> tell us what you've tried, and how it fails/how you would like it to look
[06:45:32] <FuryFoo> I'd love to but small content won't display the problem , I already have separate version that works flawless .
[06:46:05] <FuryFoo> The problem came when I've decided to adapt the code for variable numbers of sections
[06:46:18] <xec> why do you have any js at all?
[06:48:02] <FuryFoo> Have you looked at the first section ?
[06:48:15] <FuryFoo> Or section number 3 ?
[06:48:43] <FuryFoo> Do you think I'd try to use JS of I would have something that could use a fixed set of rules ?
[06:49:23] <BullsEye> @sammich, how can I trigger open method.
[06:49:30] <saedelaere> I append text to a paragraph. i get the text via ajax request and loop over the array with $.each. Problem is some elements of the array have leading whitespace characters. But when I do $('#foo').append(item); all those leading whitespace chracters are lost. how can I preserve them?
[06:49:58] <xec> FuryFoo: i didn't mean to offend you, so sorry if I did. i am sincerely curious. by section 3 do you mean .variousArt ?
[06:50:07] <Cork> saedelaere: try text()
[06:50:17] <Cork> an, append
[06:50:33] <FuryFoo> Yes
[06:50:48] <FuryFoo> Also this is how the finite version looks like : http://tinyurl.com/pd38hmx
[06:50:51] <xec> FuryFoo: okay. what about it
[06:51:52] <Cork> saedelaere: try something like $('#foo').append($('<p>').text())
[06:52:17] <xec> FuryFoo: do you have a version without any script?
[06:52:43] <ohcibi> i have an ios app with a webview that loads an html page (surprise! 8-).. in the html there is some js that uses document.body.offsetWidth and .offsetHeight. The value reported for offsetHeight is correct, the one for offsetWidth is to little (304 vs. 320), has anyone an idea why this happens?
[06:53:08] <Cork> saedelaere: alternatively use white-space: pre-wrap
[06:53:10] <Syrit> Guys, is there any Rails developer in here ? i need some advice please .
[06:53:29] <Cork> Syrit: #rubyonrails
[06:53:49] <sunbeam> Say I have header{position: fixed;} and inside <header> <div id="one">One</div> and <div id="two">Two</div> I would like tp slideDown #one, and have #two move automatically with this
[06:53:51] <FuryFoo> @xec If I where to use CSS I wouldn't be able to add another section with another set of images and have them centered . The second problem is that the number of images per row varies with the total width.
[06:53:55] <sunbeam> any idea how I can best do this?
[06:54:29] <xec> FuryFoo: why would you not be able to center? what css have you tried?
[06:54:47] <saedelaere> Cork: thank you, I'll try it!
[06:55:01] <sammich> if it's one thing that CSS does well, it's centering things
[06:55:10] <sammich> just gotta figure out the tricks
[06:55:23] <xec> FuryFoo: why is number of images per row a "problem"? how would you like the end result to be?
[06:55:47] <Syrit> Cork yes, but it's actually a jQuery question, related to rails, may be you can advice me, i think my problem is, the the action is not working with a button, unless i insert it after the page is complete, but, if it's inluded already in the page that is rendered from server response, it won't work, is that true?
[06:56:11] <biniar> $10 to whoever can write pagination for this code: https://dpaste.de/sNQM
[06:56:27] <BullsEye> @sammich , I will be very thankful to you if you give me little more hint on what you mean by "then just trigger the open method on it"..
[06:56:35] <Cork> Syrit: that is a rails question, and belongs in the rails channel
[06:56:50] <sammich> BullsEye: well, what lightbox plugin are you using?
[06:56:51] <Cork> Syrit: but no, jquery selectors work on whats in the dom
[06:57:07] <Syrit> i see , Thanks Cork
[06:57:26] <BullsEye> lightbox-2.6.min.js
[06:57:34] <FuryFoo> @xec The end result should look like this : http://tinyurl.com/pd38hmx
[06:58:08] <BullsEye> custom attribute i added on an image is rel="lightbox[1]
[06:58:21] <FuryFoo> Now can we please forget about the CSS and see what's making the JS go haywire as it does here : http://tinyurl.com/lwkax6v
[06:58:29] <stiki101> I have 100 website pages that have 5 google charts embedded. However, the embed code does not account for responsive screen sizes.
[06:58:47] <stiki101> Now I have to change all to be responsive and that would be over 1000+ edits..
[06:58:51] <FuryFoo> This isn't about practicality - it's mostly a JS refactoring exercise
[06:59:09] <FuryFoo> Make 10 lines of code do the job of 200 lines
[06:59:32] <sammich> ugh, does lightbox2 not had docs
[06:59:42] <stiki101> the original chart code is:
[06:59:43] <stiki101> <script> {"dataSourceUrl":"..."} </script>
[07:00:10] <stiki101> I need to be able to reference back to each chart so it can be redrawn, so it has to be initiated like this:
[07:00:11] <stiki101> <script> chart = new google.visualization.ChartWrapper({}); </script>
[07:00:39] <sunbeam> Say I have header{position: fixed;} and inside <header> <div id="one">One</div> and <div id="two">Two</div> I would like tp slideDown #one, and have #two move automatically with this
[07:00:43] <stiki101> Now, the issue is that I have 5 charts per page and I need a reference to each one of them..
[07:00:43] <sunbeam> any idea how I can best do this?
[07:01:09] <stiki101> I know how to do that by creating a seperate object (variable) to contain a ref to each chart, like so:
[07:01:26] <BullsEye> @sammich, the image is getting enlarge but I want it to happen after mouse if hover for 2 sec
[07:01:36] <stiki101> chart_1 = google.chart(); chart_2 = google.chart(); chart_3 = google.chart();
[07:01:41] <BullsEye> getting enlarge on click*
[07:01:52] <sammich> BullsEye: just trigger the click even on the image
[07:02:00] <jop008> jqm site using <input data in Chrome I have a date slector but in Safari I have nothing
[07:02:04] <sammich> I assume you've got the timer and things sorted?
[07:02:07] <biniar> $10 to whoever can write pagination for this code: https://dpaste.de/sNQM
[07:02:40] <stiki101> biniar! You gave me a good idea.
[07:02:43] <sammich> err
[07:02:49] <biniar> stiki101: what's that?
[07:02:50] <stiki101> I'm willing to pay for help.
[07:02:51] <sammich> that's a setInterval set to 0
[07:02:57] <stiki101> Why not.
[07:03:00] <biniar> I didn't write the code someone else did
[07:03:02] <BullsEye> sammich , that the only thing i am looking for .. I want the click event to happen after 2 sec
[07:03:13] <grafi> pagination oÃ´
[07:03:15] <grafi> dafuq?
[07:03:53] <biniar> -_-
[07:03:55] <biniar> yes
[07:03:56] <xec> FuryFoo: i'm confused. you have a page that works like you want?
[07:04:12] <biniar> it moves an image along to the display position
[07:04:22] <biniar> i want to add some dots to show which image it's on
[07:04:42] <biniar> I'll paypal someone who can help me
[07:05:00] <stiki101> i'll give you the idea for free..
[07:05:06] <biniar> okay
[07:05:08] <biniar> awesome
[07:05:17] <jop008> See this http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-09-30_at_4.03.34_PM-x5C5op7a.png compared to http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2013-09-30_at_4.03.19_PM-9temkYX4.png
[07:05:27] <jop008> why are they different?
[07:06:17] <stiki101> $(".caruse.").each(function(){ $(.caruse).addHtml("<li>link</li>"));});
[07:06:32] <anew> i get an unexpected identifier after minifying a plugin
[07:06:34] <FuryFoo> @xec Yes I already have a page that works almost like I want . The only thing that's missing is that the code on that page is section dependent.
[07:06:35] <stiki101> Its just an idea, the code aint right.
[07:06:36] <anew> cant find a minified version of it
[07:06:38] <anew> what should i do
[07:06:52] <FuryFoo> The one I'm making now is section independent
[07:06:52] <grafi> biniar paste the html :x
[07:07:14] <stiki101> I'm a bit lazy, I have my own issue to deal with and guests arriving in 10min.
[07:07:15] <Cork> anew: make sure the script has ; at the end of each line that must have it if there isn't a line break
[07:07:22] <jop008> the first picture is chrome
[07:07:33] <anew> at the end of each minfied line
[07:07:36] <jop008> the 2nd safari
[07:07:40] <anew> damnit that must be it, the guy who wrote it must have forgotten to ;
[07:07:44] <anew> pain in the arse
[07:08:10] <biniar> stiki101: thanks for the idea
[07:08:16] <xec> FuryFoo: how does the page look without the script?
[07:08:16] <sammich> BullsEye: http://jsfiddle.net/WLquD/
[07:08:34] <rabbi1> i am using .map() to get all selected options. how can i check if no option is selected with in the .map() ? is there a way.. both index and obj are returning nothingâ¦.
[07:08:36] <stiki101> biniar, did you sort of get my sloppy concept
[07:08:45] <anew> cork is there any way to include a cdn inside <script> tags ?
[07:08:50] <nights> hi
[07:08:57] <Cork> anew: "sure" ?
[07:09:01] <Cork> just link to it
[07:09:02] <anew> sorry i mean inside a .js file
[07:09:02] <anew> well
[07:09:02] <anew> nevermind
[07:09:04] <rabbi1> good nights ....
[07:09:05] <Cork> no
[07:09:19] <nights> how can i avoid loading javascript twice when using ajax?
[07:09:27] <anew> lol
[07:09:30] <xec> well, you could do document.createElement("script") etc
[07:09:32] <Cork> nights: twice?
[07:09:36] <jop008> it seems lie this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16170087/jquery-mobile-date-input-fields-and-safari-on-mac-os-x
[07:09:44] <sammich> don't so it.
[07:09:45] <xec> and link to a cdn through a generated script element
[07:09:49] <sammich> don't load it twice.
[07:09:53] <stiki101> Lets say I need to declare two objects in a variable, how do I do this without statically typing out each objects variable name, like chart_1, chart_2, chart_3
[07:09:57] <nights> yeah, the file that i want to refresh has a lot of script tags
[07:10:01] <stiki101> How about using a collection?
[07:10:03] <anew> people who write plugins and dont ; should be shot
[07:10:03] <nights> its difficult to extract that out
[07:10:08] <stiki101> like chart[]
[07:10:09] <sammich> objects, yeah
[07:10:14] <Cork> nights: as long as the browser has it in cache it won't load it from the server
[07:10:21] <nights> ok so adding
[07:10:28] <nights> cache: false
[07:10:30] <Cork> nights: though the url must match exactly for that to work
[07:10:30] <stiki101> sammich, you talking to me?
[07:10:32] <nights> will solve it?
[07:10:37] <sammich> stiki101: yeah
[07:10:48] <Cork> nights: that won't effect <script> tags
[07:10:51] <stiki101> I've been using c# lots lately..
[07:11:10] <Cork> nights: cache: false, just means jquery adds a ?timestamp after the url to work around the cache
[07:11:23] <nights> hm
[07:11:25] <nights> i see
[07:11:27] <rabbi1> i am using .map() to get all selected options. how can i check if no option is selected with in the .map() ? while both index and obj are returning nothing
[07:11:38] <nights> then what can i do? without separating script and html?
[07:11:39] <Cork> nights: and that is for the ajax calls, not content in the html
[07:11:53] <nights> i see
[07:14:35] <rabbi1> o o my badâ¦. i got it
[07:16:13] <jop008> if you view this page in safari http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/dist/demos/widgets/forms/
[07:16:33] <jop008> then you have no date picker only a field looking like text
[07:16:51] <jop008> So how ot handle dates in a common way for all browsers?
[07:17:33] <Cork> jop008: Date is common for all browsers
[07:17:47] <jop008> but http://view.jquerymobile.com/1.3.2/dist/demos/widgets/forms/ see this in safari
[07:17:57] <jop008> and seacrh for date
[07:18:06] <jop008> on the page
[07:19:11] <Cork> jop008: type="date" is meant to be it, but it isn't implemented in all desktop browsers
[07:19:40] <jop008> so what to do if it is not working for all browsers?
[07:20:00] <Cork> you would have to use a fallback, like the jquery ui dialog
[07:20:02] <sammich> polyfills, yeah
[07:20:12] <nights> Cork: so there is no way without breaking it up into html and javascript?
[07:20:21] <sammich> the bootstrap version is pretty close to the chrome datepicker
[07:20:25] <jop008> and how to implement a fallback?
[07:20:34] <Cork> nights: no
[07:20:35] <sammich> modernizer
[07:20:43] <nights> i guess what happens now is that the javascript gets added to <head> after loaded, and then when i load it again, it happens again right?
[07:20:45] <sammich> *www.modernizr.com/
[07:21:51] <nights> its too bad, i need to mix in server side code, and i also like to keep it close to my html in small files... :(
[07:22:45] <Cork> nights: so put the content into json and be done with it
[07:22:56] <jop008> use this? http://jsfiddle.net/RQzbw/
[07:23:13] <nights> cork: hmm... maybe possible
[07:23:19] <sammich> use .load()
[07:23:26] <nights> i dont understand how to use load
[07:23:35] <nights> seen it on stackoverflow
[07:23:43] <nights> is it useful for this?
[07:23:48] <sammich> jop008: yeah that's horrible for desktop users
[07:25:21] <sammich> and the key repeat rate is so slow, ugh
[07:32:56] <jop008> This one is not horrible imho http://dev.jtsage.com/jQM-DateBox/demos/mode/calbox.html
[07:42:23] <starfox21> do you know if there is some plugin to do something like what these guys (https://www.statuspage.io/) are doing in their homepage in the line that says "The best way to create a status page for your app or website. Just ask Server <company_name>" ?
[07:44:39] <anew> http://pastebin.com/mBRk29f4 ayone see anything wrong with this?
[07:44:44] <anew> no idea why but it's not firing
[07:46:40] <Cork> anew: console.log($('#facejax1').length)

[09:01:56] <duch_kazatel> that's a pretty bad idea.  and won't google ignore the library since it's javascript?
[09:02:16] <anew> ignore ?
[09:02:29] <duch_kazatel> google doesn't execute javascript i thought.
[09:11:28] <darkfrog> for some reason I'm running into a problem in certain circumstances where $('#myDiv').dialog() throws an error: "Object [object Object] has no method 'dialog'" but I can see that jquery-ui has been loaded....has anyone else seen this happen?  I'm using jQuery 1.9.1 and jQuery UI 1.10.3
[09:18:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: morning
[09:18:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: morning
[09:19:14] <darkfrog> Rohan_Bhangui: is that where you pour cheese over your cereal?
[09:19:18] <jphase> mernin Rohan
[09:19:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> darkfrog: LOL
[09:19:30] <jphase> mmmm.... Velveeta morning
[09:19:41] <cereal> woah.  cheese does not belong on cereal guys
[09:19:42] * jphase slathers himself in cheese-like product
[09:20:00] <darkfrog> cereal: if you run out of milk though, cheese has milk in it. :-p
[09:20:00] <jphase> lol, hahaha that's hilarious....
[09:20:03] <cereal> especially not melted cheese.  I gotta stay nice and crunchy somehow
[09:20:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[09:20:32] <darkfrog> cereal: cheese would probably make it less soggy than milk
[09:20:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: quick question is there a way to do a one line switch statement such that if an UPDATE mysql query fails a INSERT mysql query is sent by php
[09:20:40] <cereal> irc is full of cereal killers.  times are hard for guys like me :(
[09:20:54] <darkfrog> cereal: nice pun
[09:20:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[09:21:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> cereal: that made my day :)
[09:21:10] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: you can check the result of the UPDATE transaction with an if and then run an INSERT yeah
[09:21:15] <cereal> Rohan_Bhangui, why not just check the number of rows updated, and if its 0 do an insert?
[09:21:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: what about a or die()?
[09:21:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> cereal: true
[09:22:02] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: I'd suggest using mysql_error()
[09:22:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[09:22:15] <cereal> that's how I do almost all of my update or insert queries
[09:22:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> right now I am checking the databse for an entry
[09:22:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> if cout >= 1 than an update
[09:22:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> else INSERT
[09:22:36] <cereal> though I suppose it depends on how often you expect to be updating versus inserting
[09:22:46] <cereal> don't do a count
[09:22:48] <cereal> no need
[09:22:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> update is not frequent
[09:22:55] <cereal> just do an update which will give you a count anyways
[09:23:10] <cereal> eliminate the need for the count and you've increased the speed
[09:23:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol I love how yesterday this channel was taken over by php and "other discussions"
[09:23:21] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: but yeah, you can use the or syntax too, mysql_query('UPDATE yadda yadda') or echo 'omg I suck';
[09:23:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase:
[09:23:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[09:23:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats what i was thinking
[09:23:46] <cereal> yea, this specifically is less of a php discussion and more of logic imo
[09:24:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> 1 line switch statement
[09:24:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> cereal: true
[09:24:28] * jphase pours milk on cereal
[09:24:29] <jphase> om NOM
[09:24:40] * cereal cries
[09:24:56] <jphase> all these food nicks in here, not fair in the morning
[09:25:12] <darkfrog> jphase: I hope you're not lumping me in that category...
[09:25:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: LOL XD
[09:25:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> you know one thing I want to see beocme main stream:
[09:25:57] <jphase> lol
[09:26:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> css property flexbox
[09:26:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> so useful for responsive design
[09:26:27] * jphase uses Foundation a lot which has a variation of that
[09:26:42] <jphase> meant for video though on theirs but works for everything
[09:26:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> cereal: if it makes you feel any better i had fast food instead of cereal
[09:27:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: ive heard of Foundation....im thinkng about learning it
[09:28:20] <jphase> it's quite a nice grid to work with
[09:29:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> great for both mobile and web
[09:29:37] <jphase> I used to use bootstrap, then I found Foundation's block-grid and got a nerd boner
[09:30:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[09:30:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> ive never bothered to touch bootstrap
[09:30:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> well i have
[09:30:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> but for a slider plugin
[09:30:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> after that nothing
[09:30:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> im a bit of a freak when it comes to plugins
[09:31:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> in the sense that I prefer to builf my own things
[09:31:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> when possible
[09:31:16] <jphase> so neat! you can just add classes to a <ul> that say "when you're on mobile... 4 <li> elements will fit, otherwise 2 on large screens" etc.
[09:31:22] <jphase> yeah same
[09:31:58] <jphase> plus I like how Foundation lets you roll your own stuff, add colors, change how many columns per row, padding, select which of their javascripts (if any) you want to use, etc.
[09:32:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: i know alot of plugins/libraries/frameworks that allow you to do short hand like that
[09:32:09] <jphase> like jQuery UI's theme roller but a million times better
[09:32:36] <jphase> yeah, bootstrap isn't one of them
[09:32:42] <jphase> or at least wasn't a year ago
[09:32:49] <jphase> :~[
[09:34:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dunno im still the type to do from scratch....what i find more and more....people rely on plugins too much
[09:34:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was looking at this themeforest template
[09:34:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> the guy used 10 plugins
[09:34:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> for small shit
[09:35:10] <jphase> yeah, I'm not about using libraries when it's not needed, but I love using a grid from a css framework cause it's just-add-water media queries
[09:35:21] <jphase> if you can hand pick what of their framework you want, then it's fine by me :D
[09:35:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[09:35:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> i myself only devlop for 960
[09:35:35] <jphase> granted, on some more fancy sites I do, I do 100% custom media queries
[09:35:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> occasionally on 1200 px like this site
[09:35:53] <jphase> well that's quite accommodating, and how I'd prefer to develop too
[09:35:57] <jphase> but yeah, normally the latter for me
[09:36:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://gethighered.ca/
[09:36:08] <jphase> cause the silly designer puts a million things on the page
[09:36:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya its annoying
[09:36:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> plus when using 1200px is best
[09:36:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> cuase most monitors will not be 800*600 and people that do have those monitors suck
[09:37:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> plus most monitors now a days are atleast 1366*768
[09:37:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> which about 3-4 years ago was not even a standard
[09:37:52] <jphase> yeah, and the folks that use 1980 x whatever will whine about how unused the space is if you keep your page container at 960 on larger monitors
[09:37:57] <jphase> depends on how needy the client is imo
[09:39:12] <jphase> the other day a client sent me a screenshot of a HUGE resolution talking about site real estate and I wanted to be like "stop browsing the site on your T.V." but... monitors will all get bigger over time so I see the point
[09:39:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[09:39:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> like my laptop monitor
[09:39:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> 15.6" screen
[09:39:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> resolution
[09:40:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> not 1366*768 like my old laptop
[09:40:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> its 1920*1080\

[09:40:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> its insane whats happening
[09:40:39] <jphase> but the same people that don't understand that are the same people that don't understand that 100% of developers don't use IE as their main browser
[09:40:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> cereal: im hungry for cereal sry
[09:40:48] <T13|needsCoffee> !api contents

[09:41:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: luckily
[09:42:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> opera atleast is switching to webkit
[09:42:06] <jphase> orly?
[09:42:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> for the newer versions
[09:42:09] <jphase> neat
[09:42:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[09:42:13] <jphase> I always liked opera
[09:42:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> it was announced about 1.5 months ago
[09:42:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> oepra is....well differnt
[09:42:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> its got mousegeastures an stuff
[09:42:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> its interesting
[09:42:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> it desnt feel like webkit
[09:42:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> like safari and chrome have a similar feel
[09:42:57] <jphase> yeah, that was fairly neat, and their mobile browser was fun for that
[09:43:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> but opera is different
[09:43:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh their mobile browser is amazing
[09:44:25] <jop008> Can someone give me a sweat example iwth date routine
[09:44:36] <jphase> sweat?
[09:44:45] <jop008> I use http://dev.jtsage.com/cdn/datebox/latest/jqm-datebox.core.min.js
[09:45:03] <T13|needsCoffee> Sure... let me work some up for you.
[09:45:11] <jop008> and want to choose year and month easily in all browsers
[09:45:38] <jop008> I tried and ask for help that is the use of irc
[09:46:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[09:47:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: i still think web has alot to offer....i see web becoming so powerful as it will replace native apps on smart phones
[09:48:14] <jphase> yeah, that's why I'm getting more into web apps lately, node and python apps specifically
[09:48:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya...i dont entirely agree wtih jquery mobile but it is a good place to start....web apps in my opion is the future
[09:48:52] <jphase> It's so hard to go away from php and apache cause they're so simple
[09:48:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> more and more stuff is moving to the cloud
[09:48:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[09:49:03] <jphase> haha, yeah
[09:49:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol php is honestly the first language I actually fell in love with
[09:49:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> it was hard but so fun
[09:49:42] <jphase> I just started implementing Plone CMS/DMS for a client and it got me thinking more in terms of application servers
[09:49:49] <jphase> Python based CMS
[09:50:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[09:50:01] <jphase> kinda fun, but still more complicated than I'd want for developers
[09:50:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> you know sublime runs on python right?
[09:52:41] <jphase> yeah
[09:53:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was surprised but it makes sense
[09:54:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: btw what does wikipedia run on? wordpress?
[09:55:34] <jphase> no, 100% custom wiki that's open source
[09:55:40] <hlve> Can anyone help me simplify this code into being more reusable? http://pastebin.com/RunbEMnb
[09:55:42] <jphase> their platform is used widely
[09:56:25] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: specifically called "MediaWiki" http://www.wikimedia.org/
[09:56:32] <jphase> they use it for a lot of the things the foundation supports
[09:58:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: i think you can add commas
[09:58:20] <hlve> lol
[09:58:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: $("#excelExport", "#xmlExport", "#csvExport", etc. ).click(function ()
[09:58:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: okay thanks
[09:59:00] <hlve> Rohan_Bhangui, I'm somewhat new.
[09:59:01] <hlve> :\
[09:59:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> to jquery?
[09:59:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> also modern way of writing click is
[09:59:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> $("div").on("click", function() {});
[09:59:39] <hlve> well, I know my way around the basics... I'm just newish on writing reusable code for larger projects like this.
[09:59:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> or atleast thats how i do it
[09:59:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[09:59:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> tell me something
[10:00:04] <hlve> that's why it's a blurb of redundant code
[10:00:05] <hlve> lol
[10:00:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> why cant you give all those id divs the same class
[10:00:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> or a smae id
[10:00:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> so 2 ids
[10:00:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> or 1 id and 1 class
[10:01:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: makes sense?
[10:01:42] <hlve> Sorta.
[10:02:03] <hlve> Sec.

[10:08:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: ^ thats what you want to do
[10:08:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> rabbi1: what is this unique id? you mean the value?
[10:09:21] <rabbi1> Rohan_Bhangui: the index
[10:09:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> index?
[10:09:38] <DarkL> Need some help. Currently am making a site, and info shows when you hover over an image as show. You will also see that the jQuery code is messy and complicated. Wondering if there was an easier way to do this http://jsfiddle.net/qRZdB/
[10:09:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> you mean the position of the <option>
[10:10:23] <rabbi1> if u select the option 1 after the other then it's good, if u select backwards, i get the different id in my fiddle (technically index)
[10:10:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> rabbi1: let me study code
[10:11:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> DarkL: give all the images a common class and then use 1 .hove
[10:11:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> *.hover
[10:11:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> also you should use mouse over/mouseenter and mouseleaver
[10:11:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> *mouseleaver
[10:11:26] <rabbi1> i just need a different id for each of the option selected, that's itâ¦ i know how can i do with a loop instead, but having this indexâ¦. the i value is dsc always ...
[10:11:28] <hlve> THANK YOU :)
[10:11:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> mouseleave
[10:11:39] <dstarh> Anyone have any luck placing a google ad inside of a JQUI Dialog?  When it draws the ad all content is cleared and only the ad is displayed

[10:12:49] <dstarh> I've seen a few links where people discuss the issue but non with a resolution
[10:13:27] <rabbi1> DarkL: you can use $.map or $.each â¦..
[10:13:48] <DarkL> Oh alright. Are you going to change the fiddle to show me?
[10:14:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> DarkL: give me 30 sec
[10:14:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> i got this
[10:14:09] <DarkL> Oh, wrong person :P

[10:14:57] <jedimind> aro css3
[10:15:06] <aro> not using css3
[10:15:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> DarkL: why are you using td?
[10:15:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> td/tr
[10:16:16] <DarkL> Just wanted to get a basic version out quick. Thats all
[10:16:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> for positioning right
[10:17:11] <DarkL> At the moment yes
[10:17:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> why dont you float divs right and left
[10:17:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> and than  clear both
[10:18:10] <DarkL> Again, I will later. This was just a quick test page, mainly to try and get this jQuery worked out
[10:19:55] <DarkL> Done with that Fiddle?
[10:20:01] <aro> how would i make a background fade in and out with css3?
[10:20:37] <ThePendulum> Greetings. I have this page: http://unknown.name/projects/tripquest/results . I'd like to have the hidden <tr>s in the popularity table show up like in the addiction table if I click "Show all", but I can't get it to work with the .toggle. Any suggestions?

[10:25:45] <DarkL> Ill take a look. Thanks for that
[10:26:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> DarkL: basically I used the classes and then pointed to the right overlay...but for some reason it wont first
[10:26:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> fire
[10:27:54] <rabbi1> Rohan_Bhangui: he has got the classname wrong
[10:28:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> ???
[10:28:22] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/qRZdB/8/
[10:28:29] <DarkL> You do too
[10:28:54] <DarkL> Wait, maybe
[10:29:28] <rabbi1> DarkL: that's just a typo â¦ chill
[10:29:29] <rabbi1> happens
[10:29:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> i have a feeling the td/tr stuff is messing with the overlay
[10:29:44] <DarkL> Works fine in my buggy way though
[10:29:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh lol thumnail
[10:30:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> DarkL: got it http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/qRZdB/12/
[10:30:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> your class was thumnail
[10:30:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> it needs to be thum*b*nail
[10:30:41] <DarkL> Oh wow. Yeah
[10:30:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[10:30:49] <DarkL> Thanks for you other help though
[10:30:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> just get rid of alerts
[10:30:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> and you should be fine
[10:31:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> np DarkL
[10:31:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> rabbi1: nice spot
[10:31:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> DarkL: without alerts http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/qRZdB/13/
[10:32:05] <DarkL> Yeah cheers. Implementing on my site now
[10:32:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> DarkL: your overlays flicker when you hover over them
[10:32:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> might wanna solve this by writing a function such that
[10:32:32] <rabbi1> Rohan_Bhangui: lil help on my fiddleâ¦. kinda more complicated ...
[10:32:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure
[10:33:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> so i selected 3 ids from each select menu
[10:33:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> now what
[10:33:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh wait is it suppose to replace th existing id:2 when i click another?
[10:34:08] <DarkL> Yeah I'll work on that later. GOing to have a look into .child and .parent now. Thanks for all your help
[10:34:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> DarkL: something like this $("td).children().on("mouseover.....
[10:34:17] <DarkL> Ah yep
[10:34:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[10:34:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> np :)
[10:35:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> rabbi1: see comments above
[10:35:58] <rabbi1> Rohan_Bhangui: nope, it's dynamic selection of options
[10:36:13] <rabbi1> what ever user selects has to display belowâ¦ simple
[10:36:30] <rabbi1> but if already displayed, then it should not push to array
[10:36:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> but like when  Iclick the first select and select antoher option
[10:36:56] <rabbi1> actually most of the stuff's are done, but selected the previous options is changing the index and having problems
[10:37:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> it shows the second slected option
[10:37:11] <rabbi1> all selected options
[10:37:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmm
[10:37:36] <rabbi1> but if you select the option form second column and select option from first,.. it screws up, cos of index
[10:38:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> oic
[10:38:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> the id is 0
[10:38:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> even if i select from 1st colum
[10:38:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmm got it
[10:38:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> apply id to all selects
[10:38:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> or a custom attribute
[10:39:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then when you put down result
[10:39:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> read that custom attribute
[10:40:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> rabbi1: you get my drift?
[10:40:51] <rabbi1> yeah
[10:41:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> dont rely on .each to give you the id value
[10:41:19] <rabbi1> Rohan_Bhangui: infact i am working on a slider, i need that id to append n number of timesâ¦. and should not be duplicated
[10:41:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> yh
[10:41:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> rabbi1: let me know if my solution works for this case
[10:42:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> brb
[10:42:33] <hlve> Rohan_Bhangui. Codes not working. :(. http://jsfiddle.net/dfv4U

[11:04:42] <Decalmo> hhhhhheeelllo
[11:05:01] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know how to get proper syntax highlighting in Sublime Text when I'm using .deferred() to make $ = jq ?
[11:05:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> Decalmo: heeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllllllloooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
[11:05:15] <Decalmo> hahahah
[11:05:17] <Decalmo> yea!
[11:05:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> DarkL: where are you
[11:05:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> your ul is set to display none
[11:05:47] <Decalmo> who, me?
[11:06:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> no not
[11:06:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> you
[11:06:04] <Decalmo> aye
[11:06:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> a guy i was helping earlier
[11:06:11] <Decalmo> gotcha
[11:06:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> so what you want
[11:06:40] <WebDragon> am I wrong in thinking that jsfiddle should link to jquery 1.10.2 and not 1.10.1 ?
[11:07:07] <WebDragon> (as well as 1.x(edge))
[11:07:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> always use lastest one
[11:07:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> edge always
[11:07:40] <Decalmo> I was wondering if anyone might be able to help me out with a small lil' problem I'm running into... pretty new to jQuery here etc.. basically I'm trying to write a script that will dynamically POST my forms via AJAX and returnt hem to the nearest div with the appropriate name... There would be multiple items like this on a page, multiple forms inside a div etc... here's where I'm at so far
[11:07:40] <Decalmo> but its not working!
[11:07:41] <Decalmo> http://jsfiddle.net/XG5kB/
[11:07:53] <WebDragon> except that is not what ships with wordpress, so one does not always have the luxury
[11:08:14] <WebDragon> one MUST test with what one needs first, then if it does not work THEN make adjustments as necessary
[11:08:49] <WebDragon> useful for establishing minimum compatibility
[11:09:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> Decalmo: your submit button should ahve an event.preventDefault();
[11:09:07] <WebDragon> but jsfiddle should still have 1.10.2 and not 1.10.1 available in the dropdown
[11:09:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> to prevent redirect
[11:09:33] <Decalmo> does not the return false down tehre handle that?
[11:10:33] <Decalmo> ok updated: http://jsfiddle.net/XG5kB/1/
[11:12:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> so what is it suppsoe to do
[11:12:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> print results to a div?
[11:14:04] <Decalmo> yeaaa
[11:14:12] <Decalmo> like, ive got a few of these sections
[11:14:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> well lets create empty div
[11:15:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> well shouldnt you have php code in the html ready to echo the $.post data
[11:15:28] <Decalmo> yea I've got the POST route working already
[11:15:32] <Decalmo> im actually doing this in a framework
[11:15:41] <Decalmo> well, duh
[11:17:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> well then
[11:17:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/XG5kB/2/
[11:17:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> so see how I have the #results div
[11:17:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> well insert php code for echo posted data in there
[11:17:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> then in the .done
[11:18:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> get the data find the content inside the $results
[11:18:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then .html
[11:18:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> that data to #results
[11:18:31] <Decalmo> ok checking it out
[11:18:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[11:18:37] <Decalmo> (and thanks a bunch for helping me!)
[11:18:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> np: i love to help
[11:20:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> Decalmo: remember the echoing php is done inside the #results div
[11:20:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> and masure you check if the data you are sending isset
[11:21:28] <Decalmo> aye
[11:22:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol

[11:38:53] <jphase> a veteran
[11:39:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> Decalmo: the data is sent in seperatve variables sent kind of like in array format

[11:43:45] <Decalmo> http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[11:43:49] <jphase> fission6: old school form array will do it or you could us the ajaxFileuploader (I think that's what it's called) plugin, or look at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/166221/how-can-i-upload-files-asynchronously-with-jquery
[11:43:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> Decalmo: any luck
[11:44:11] <Decalmo> hmmm not what I'm looking for just yet
[11:44:13] <Decalmo> jsut as an example though
[11:44:21] <Decalmo> I can get my other script to work perfectly...
[11:44:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[11:44:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> let me know
[11:45:09] <fission6> thanks jphase
[11:45:52] <jphase> np
[11:47:16] <Decalmo> OK Rohan_Bhangui: this script works perfectly for me, submits the form and returns the results... problem is I would like to just make this into a generic script that works for ANY form on the page, and returns to its nearest corresponding <div id="aJax"> frame
[11:47:17] <Decalmo> http://jsfiddle.net/9S25k/
[11:47:32] <Decalmo> because I don't want to have to copy-pasta these bad boys for every iteration of my post content
[11:47:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmm that seems a bit more complex
[11:47:53] <jphase> Decalmo: I made a .AJAXify function that turns any form into an ajax form if you want to peep the code
[11:47:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: any help
[11:48:02] <jphase> sure 1 sec
[11:48:04] <Decalmo> jphase yea that'd be great thanks
[11:48:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: when i requested help it was for Decalmo 's issue
[11:48:34] <jphase> Decalmo: http://pastebin.ws/3eipge
[11:48:51] <jphase> it takes the action and method attributes from the form, then builds the object to post
[11:48:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> Decalmo: i highly recommend you store a local copy of that code
[11:48:53] <jphase> post/get
[11:48:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause it erases after a while
[11:49:05] <Decalmo> gotcha gotcha
[11:49:19] <jphase> yeah, I set it to "never" expire... but his site goes down from nginx configs every once in awhile too hehe
[11:49:24] <Decalmo> aye aye
[11:49:25] <jphase> old buddy of mine wrote this
[11:49:34] <Decalmo> reading now... thanks again
[11:49:35] <jphase> (pastebin.ws that is)
[11:49:37] <jphase> np
[11:53:17] <Decalmo> now jphase would this work with multiple forms on the page?
[11:54:27] <jphase> yeah, should work but haven't tested honestly
[11:55:00] <Decalmo> gotcha
[11:55:09] <Decalmo> alrighty I'm gonna see if I can tweak this to my needs
[11:55:15] <Decalmo> many thanks to both of you
[11:55:37] <jphase> anytime
[12:04:20] <anew> hey guys any way to load jquery asynchronously
[12:04:44] <snover> jquery supports AMD
[12:05:34] <anew> yeah either way you have to include it in <scipt/> tags dont u
[12:05:45] <snover> go read what AMD is
[12:06:17] <anew> no i mean i dont want to use a loader like require
[12:06:23] <anew> can i do it onpage somehow
[12:06:29] <anew> without having to bloat my page more
[12:07:48] <anew> i guess require is the only way ?
[12:08:07] <anew> hmmm
[12:08:09] <RadListControl1> is this the right way to wireup a dynamically created radiobutton? $("input[name='optColor']").bind("change", function() {
[12:08:22] <RadListControl1> .. it's not working
[12:08:58] <DeltaHeavy> If I'm using '$(this)' a lot, should I store it in a variable or does jQuery handle the caching of that?
[12:09:07] <NoiseEee> DeltaHeavy: you're in charge of your own caching
[12:09:13] <DeltaHeavy> Awesome, thanks
[12:09:33] <anew> i mean even with require.js
[12:09:40] <anew> that is still not technically loading async  is it
[12:10:05] <NoiseEee> what does 'load jquery async' mean to you anew?
[12:10:30] <anew> i mean when i'm loading my page i have to wait for the script to load for certain events to fire on the top of my page
[12:11:25] <anew> i need to load these resources at the same time my page is loading
[12:11:54] <NoiseEee> anew: what does that have to do with jquery or async?
[12:12:17] <anew> everything... i have to either 1)load it async 2) defer the loading or 3) do it inline
[12:12:29] <anew> because the page does not render until this script is reached and loaded
[12:12:42] <anew> an external script will fk it all up
[12:12:50] <NoiseEee> anew: "the page does not render" or what you have scripted does not start?
[12:12:51] <dupa> hello, i ask for helo with live query result from mysql. i dont know jquery, i am not web dev and i only need this 1 small script
[12:13:11] <anew> i need the things on the page to render async!
[12:13:51] <NoiseEee> anew: then put your scripts at the bottom before </body>, i still don't get your issue
[12:13:59] <NoiseEee> anew: you want the DOM to be loaded already before its loaded?
[12:14:13] <RadListControl1> any idea why this isn't working on dynamically created radiobuttons? $("input[name='optType']").on("click", function () {
[12:14:24] <RadListControl1> i've also tried bind
[12:14:31] <anew> wait i'll give u a paste
[12:14:49] <NoiseEee> RadListControl1: you need to put that on a DOM element/common parent of all dynamically created radio buttons
[12:15:13] <NoiseEee> $(someParent).on('click','input[name="optType"]',function(){}) @ RadListControl1
[12:15:17] <anew> http://pastebin.com/edVsMrUq NoiseEee i'm trying to fix this issue
[12:15:33] <RadListControl1> ah ok, thanks
[12:15:35] <Jabberwock> C;ear
[12:15:37] <Jabberwock> ops
[12:15:39] <Jabberwock> OOPS
[12:15:41] <RadListControl1> i'll use the parent div
[12:16:00] <NoiseEee> anew: i don't think your issue is jquery, and that's not a helpful pastebin.
[12:16:31] <anew> yes my issue is exactly jq
[12:16:34] <anew> and the js files that follow it
[12:21:05] <Decalmo> jphase: are you still there?
[12:21:49] <gates> Can you make it so an iframe link always opens in the parent page?
[12:22:02] <jphase> Decalmo: actually on my way out, but I'll be back in like 20 mins, gotta grab lunch
[12:22:15] <Decalmo> sounds good
[12:22:17] <Decalmo> thanks mang
[12:22:19] <jphase> brb
[12:22:22] <Decalmo> aye
[12:24:09] <gates> somethign like this
[12:24:10] <gates> http://jsfiddle.net/TRmau/4/
[12:25:56] <gates> i assume its a permission error?
[12:28:43] <Assimilater> isn't there a way to set a fixed height for an accordion in pixels? I seem to remember that being an option...
[12:31:44] <Assimilater> looks like I have to wrap it in a fixed height div
[12:32:55] <dupa> hello, i ask for helo with live query result from mysql. i dont know jquery, i am not web dev and i only need this 1 small script
[12:32:55] <CorySimmons> Hey guys, anyone know how I can bind a CSS keyframe animation to an event? For some reason the animation never really fires. http://jsfiddle.net/CorySimmons/5xe6f/1/
[12:33:23] <CorySimmons> Oh, did I mention I'm trying to bind it to SVG element?
[12:34:20] <Wolf_22> I have some code that gets fired-off with .submit(). I need to know what element was clicked on that fires this off. Is this possible WITHIN the .submit() logic itself?
[12:34:37] <Assimilater> dupa: jquery is a javascript library, if you need help with mysql you might have better luck in #mysql
[12:35:29] <dupa> i wanna query mysql in live
[12:35:33] <dupa> and see what is in table
[12:35:38] <dupa> for example in loop 5 sec
[12:35:40] <dupa> for new records
[12:36:17] <NoiseEee> dupa: not possible, sorry, you would have to learn/know what you're doing.
[12:37:18] <Assimilater> Wolf_22: not sure, but you can bind $('button#myButton').click() and use .stopPropagation() if that helps http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[12:38:44] <Wolf_22> Assimilater: Thanks. I'll check that out. I was hoping I could suss something out from 'e' that's being passed into that submit call (i.e. - <whatever>.submit(function(e){...} )
[12:39:49] <Assimilater> Wolf_22: ya, afaik no such information is passed through that event handler
[12:40:17] <Wolf_22> Assimilater: Yeah, I didn't think so but I thought it might be worth a shot.
[12:41:01] <CorySimmons> Anyone know how I can bind a CSS keyframe animation class to an SVG? http://jsfiddle.net/CorySimmons/5xe6f/4/
[13:10:54] <Decalmo> jphase you aren't back yet, are you?
[13:11:17] <visualshock> How can I make something happen every 5 or 10 second with modulo and a variable of millisecond since the program started?
[13:12:40] <jphase> Decalmo: sup?
[13:15:01] <Decalmo> yoooo
[13:15:06] <Decalmo> so I'm trying to get this bad boy to function
[13:15:11] <Decalmo> and if I understand correctly
[13:15:52] <Decalmo> I call the form id or just the form element, and then I specify the DIV id/class I want the result forwarded to in the $('form').AJAXify('#dividhere'); box afterwards, correct?
[13:16:32] <Decalmo> from there this script should pull out the action and the data and run a good old normal POST on it, and then return the HTML result to the div I requested
[13:16:33] <jphase> let me look at this, I wrote this a bit ago
[13:16:37] <Decalmo> noooo problemo
[13:16:54] <jphase> yeah exactly
[13:17:12] <Decalmo> kk
[13:17:27] <Decalmo> im having trouble getting it to actually update the DIV that I specify with the AJAXift('#thisdivplease'); area
[13:17:47] <Decalmo> but lemme trouble shoot a little more
[13:17:55] <jphase> oh, you have to pass a jQuery DOM object actually
[13:18:00] <jphase> so wrap it in $()
[13:18:08] <Decalmo> aaaaaa...
[13:18:11] <jphase> .AJAXify($('div'));
[13:18:20] <jphase> I should've made it a selector though in retrospect
[13:18:38] <Decalmo> good good
[13:18:42] <Decalmo> that helps
[13:18:42] <Decalmo> :)
[13:19:59] <jphase> Decalmo: also, this was made prior to .prop... do a find/replace of .attr to .prop
[13:20:10] <jphase> it will make it less-ghetto
[13:20:24] <Decalmo> aye aye
[13:20:54] <jphase> oh, actually... lol, I used .prop in one line but not in the rest... I just nubbed or copy/pasted from another function I wrote probably
[13:21:10] <Decalmo> k so just replace those other .attr lines back to .prop?
[13:21:14] <jphase> yeah
[13:25:04] <Decalmo> so how is the data object passed in the post?
[13:25:22] <Decalmo> using some good old $_POST['field'] doesn't seem to be snaggign it
[13:25:36] <jphase> do you have the method="post" setup on your form?
[13:25:45] <Decalmo> hmmm yup
[13:25:47] <jphase> k
[13:26:02] <jphase> erm, it should pass that way anyhow... look at your network tab
[13:26:09] <jphase> do you see the values go across correctly or no?
[13:26:19] <Decalmo> lemme gander...
[13:28:09] <Decalmo> oh wierd... some of it goes... lemme see if I messed anythign else when setting stuff up
[13:28:32] <jphase> it's quite possible there's something I'm missing too so don't assume it's bullet proof ;)
[13:28:42] <Decalmo> aye aye, thanks anyhow bro!
[13:28:44] <jphase> I pooped this out when I was bored and only tested it on one form
[13:29:02] <Decalmo> im sure I've got something goofed here
[13:29:05] <Decalmo> I'll figure it out
[13:29:05] <MariusIT> hello, how can i change only the class that triggered the event? http://pastebin.com/yH1nYSgL
[13:29:11] <Decalmo> thanks again for the help
[13:29:14] <jphase> np man
[13:29:53] <jphase> MariusIT: put something like var clicked = $(this); at the top
[13:30:07] <jphase> MariusIT: then $(this).removeClass('favoriteBookmarked');
[13:30:09] <jphase> er
[13:30:11] <jphase> ...
[13:30:16] <jphase> clicked.removeClass rather
[13:30:46] <jphase> also, remember .attr = .prop now ;]
[13:32:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: sup
[13:33:04] <jphase> herro :)
[13:33:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> more cereal jokes?
[13:34:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> i guess we save those for to
[13:34:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> *tom
[13:36:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: you still having problems
[13:36:14] <hlve> yeah. it's just not working at all anymore.
[13:36:21] <hlve> lol
[13:36:29] <hlve> I went back to my old shit code
[13:36:29] <hlve> and its still broked
[13:41:29] <tylargh> best way to listen to an elements attribute change using jQuery?
[13:42:09] <tylargh> something like $("div[aria-hidden]").on("change", function() { /* ... */ });
[13:42:18] <tylargh> errr
[13:43:36] <NoiseEee> tylargh: you don't get notified of an elements attribute change.
[13:44:05] <tylargh> there is DOMAttrModified
[13:44:10] <tylargh> but that is DOM api
[13:44:22] <tylargh> just wondering if there is a jQuery way
[13:45:47] <MariusIT> jphase: thank you, it works! :X
[13:50:49] <guide_X> how do I auto select a select option i'm creating like this? $("#myListBox").append(jQuery("<option>", { value: valueValue, text: textValue }));
[13:51:01] <jphase> np
[13:51:57] <jphase> guide_X: append and then select
[13:52:17] <guide_X> hmm oki
[13:52:25] <guide_X> so can't have it selected at the same time I add eh?
[13:52:34] <jphase> $('#myListBox').append($('<option>').prop({value: valueValue})).val(valueValue);
[13:52:37] <jphase> something like that
[13:52:39] <jphase> hmm, maybe
[13:52:55] <jphase> I would just chain it but there might be another appraoch
[13:54:29] <myosotis> what element should I bind an event handler on to listen for events on future elements?
[13:54:32] <Assimilater> does anyone happen to see any painfully obvious mistakes as to why $('body').on('click', 'button.cToolbox', function() { ... }); would not be triggered while $('button.cToolbox').click(function() { ... }) does?
[13:54:39] <guide_X> hmm I kind of need it to look like this, is it possible? <option selected blah="" blah=""></option>
[13:54:43] <myosotis> is document or 'body' good enough? or does it get faster the closer to the generated elements I get
[13:55:07] <guide_X> maybe I should just append it as text
[13:55:43] <myosotis> is $('#generated_element_container').on('action', function() {}); faster than $('body').on('action', function() {});
[13:55:54] <jphase> guide_X: you can use a text string if you want or you can use .prop({selected: 'selected', blah: ''}) and so on and so forth
[13:55:58] <jphase> up to you
[13:56:18] <guide_X> hmm cause i'm using a library to use options where they have 'selected' in the option tag
[13:56:33] <guide_X> but with selected: 'selected' it's not working, so maybe just append as text will be eaiser
[13:57:00] <jphase> perhaps that would be easier yeah, kind of surprising that the plugin doesn't recognize selected="selected"
[13:57:18] <guide_X> hmm yeah...
[13:57:42] <guide_X> this is the "jquery chosen" library
[13:58:02] <jphase> oh, love that one
[13:58:07] <jphase> harvest ftw :)
[13:58:30] <guide_X> hmm haven't tried harvest
[13:58:40] <jphase> oh no, harvest made the chosen library
[13:58:52] <jphase> the company name
[13:58:58] <jphase> they make a SaaS time tracking software
[13:59:11] <guide_X> oic
[14:06:06] <Assimilater> does anyone happen to see any painfully obvious mistakes as to why $('body').on('click', 'button.cToolbox', function() { ... }); would not be triggered while $('button.cToolbox').click(function() { ... }) does?
[14:08:06] <jphase> Assimilater: not unless button.cToolbox doesn't exist in the body
[14:08:24] <jphase> case sensitivity maybe?
[14:09:29] <jphase> That's a delegated approach though so it depends on your markup
[14:10:02] <Assimilater> jphase: in what way does it depend on the markup?
[14:10:15] <dismist> anyone know of a way to go about "simulating" a synchronous style of back-to-back ajax requests while still keeping the ajax mode asynchronous so as not to lock up the browser?  I basically need to wait until my .ajax call is completed and I actually have the data back before initiating another call like its currently doing
[14:10:51] <dismist> its supposed to go through a list of li items and run an ajax script on them, when one is done processing, run the script on the next li
[14:10:55] <jphase> Assimilater: http://api.jquery.com/on/  if you look at their delegated approach with the "tr" as their second param, you'll see they mention "A delegated-events approach attaches an event handler to only one element, the tbody, and the event only needs to bubble up one level (from the clicked tr to tbody):"
[14:11:07] <jonclark> dismist, use deferreds
[14:11:21] <dismist> jonclark: can you expound a bit pelase
[14:11:46] <Assimilater> jphase: I wasn't 100% what to make of that, does it mean the clicked object must be a direct child?
[14:11:48] <jonclark> hmm, hard to explain simply.. but they are a way of getting things to act only when other certain things are done
[14:12:00] <jphase> yes
[14:12:16] <Assimilater> ok...well that's why then
[14:13:40] <Assimilater> jphase: thanks
[14:13:45] <jphase> np
[14:14:50] <jonclark> dismist, learning deferreds would be the ideal way to do things
[14:15:23] <jonclark> but you can also just do the 2nd ajax call within the success callback of the first ajax call, etc.
[14:15:24] <dismist> jonclark: is that a fancy way for saying to put the next call in the callback?
[14:15:31] <dismist> guess not
[14:15:42] <jonclark> no, deferreds give you much more control
[14:15:49] <dismist> yeah i cant put it in the callback because theres an undeterminde amount of items and lots of them
[14:16:07] <dismist> damn, i remember reading up on deferreds one time, i dont think i was able to grasp the concept
[14:16:35] <dismist> one guy actually helped me write some code that did it one time, and i still dont fully understand the code.... but it uses .each and slice to run the ajax sequentially
[14:16:46] <jphase> http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/
[14:17:03] * jphase needs to learn how to use b-ot
[14:17:05] <jonclark> good intro blog post: http://www.erichynds.com/blog/using-deferreds-in-jquery
[14:17:12] <jphase> !api jQuery.deferred.done
[14:17:12] <b-ot> jphase: No matches.
[14:17:15] <jphase> :[
[14:18:04] <jonclark> maybe this could be good: http://danieldemmel.me/blog/2013/03/22/an-introduction-to-jquery-deferred-slash-promise/
[14:18:12] <jonclark> they are tough though, dismist
[14:18:14] <jonclark> don't give up!
[14:19:01] <dismist> jonclark: can u tell me what this is doing? it is my current code which runs excellent and does exactly what i am asking about. http://pastebin.com/M7FEb3rv  the stuff we're talking about starts around line 19
[14:19:16] <jonclark> i can't help sry i am just leaving work atm :(
[14:19:22] <Bloomberg> hi guys!!
[14:19:26] <dismist> line 25 looks like where the magic is happening... he wrote this:  (jq=jq.slice(1)).length && getAge(jq);
[14:19:47] <dismist> and its all wrapped in a .each
[14:19:47] <Bloomberg> someone has worked with this plugin ?
[14:19:48] <Bloomberg> http://www.jtable.org/
[14:20:16] <dismist> i take that back he must have removed my .each
[14:20:45] <dismist> bloomberg: looks pretty tight, well maintained
[14:21:14] <dismist> whats CRUD?
[14:21:29] <jonclark> create, read, update, delete
[14:26:41] <Bloomberg> dismist: you has worked with that plugin?
[14:28:29] <jonclark> Bloomberg, ask your question to the whole channel, if someone can help they will answer
[14:29:02] <Bloomberg> Ok

[14:48:18] <mllie> Hello
[14:48:33] <jphase> oh np shinobi_one_
[14:48:52] <mllie> I have a map-function that returns an array of elements. Then I try to do $(arr).hide(); but without success. Why isn't the elements in the array hidden?
[15:05:17] <chandaal> i have a select dropdown with 2 values, CA and USA, how can I run a conditional check, if CA is selected
[15:07:39] <jphase> chandaal: $('#yourSelect').change(function(){ if($(this).val() == 'CA'){ alert('California Bro!'); });
[15:07:43] <jphase> something like that
[15:07:54] <jphase> .on('change', function(){     also works, .change is just an alias for that
[15:12:55] <anew> http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/ anyone know of something like this, but i dont want the 'start upload' button there
[15:13:01] <chandaal> thank you
[15:13:04] <anew> sorry i mean the 'start' button
[15:13:12] <anew> when u select an image, there are two start buttons
[15:13:16] <anew> confusing for the user
[15:30:07] <Atlantic777> How to focus an input field when using jQuery mobile? I'm trying with $(document).ready( function () { $("#token_input").focus(); } ); but it's not working.
[15:32:08] <jphase> Atlantic777: still the iOS issue eh?
[15:32:26] <jphase> or was that someone else?
[15:32:35] <Atlantic777> jphase: it wasn't me probably. :)
[15:32:51] <Atlantic777> I was one with trigger('create') and listview('refresh'). :D
[15:32:57] <jphase> ahh right
[15:33:03] <jphase> hmm, that should work =\
[15:33:37] <jphase> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0a2/experiments/api-viewer/docs/focus/
[15:34:04] <jphase> check for errors, or maybe a mis-typed selector?
[15:34:04] <Atlantic777> jphase: I found it there, too.
[15:34:35] <Atlantic777> I'm pretty sure this part of code worked before using jQuery mobile, just pure jQuery.
[15:34:42] <Atlantic777> So it's probably not a typo.
[15:34:42] <jphase> Atlantic777: try putting a .select() right after it
[15:34:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: still having issues?
[15:34:53] <jphase> yeah, nothing to do with jquerymobile really
[15:35:17] <hlve> Rohan_Bhangui, can't get the code to work. I'm using the redundant one for now.
[15:35:19] <jphase> Atlantic777: $("#token_input").focus().select();
[15:35:31] <Atlantic777> jphase: didn't help.
[15:35:36] <jphase> :~[
[15:35:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: send link for short versio lets work it out.....just give me 10 mi
[15:36:23] <hlve> sec
[15:37:12] <jphase> Atlantic777: well idk, .focus() really should work on anything. Is it not working on a particular device? Last night I discovered that iOS devices have issues with .focus() and .select() from some issue with their mouseup event
[15:37:38] <Atlantic777> jphase: I'm testing in firefox on a Linux.
[15:38:25] <Atlantic777> And it's not working in chromium, too.
[15:39:35] <modcure> using 	$("input[type=checkbox]").click( function() {}); when the page loads..  im using ajax to add some some that contain checkboxes but the listen doesnt recognize the new checkboxes. any idea how to fix?
[15:41:04] <hlve> Rohan_Bhangui: jsfiddle.net/cgxnB
[15:41:05] <hlve> ^^
[15:41:10] <hlve> er. sorry. http://jsfiddle.net/cgxnB
[15:41:11] <hlve> :P
[15:41:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> give me 5min
[15:42:30] <hlve> so basically, just a quick run through as I can't sandbox the entire page. The page this code sits on has about 10 divs with the class 'jqx-grid'. Only one div is visible at a time. When clicking one of the list-items, it should export the appropriate filetype
[15:42:36] <Atlantic777> jphase: actually, it works without jquery mobile on the same page.
[15:43:07] <jphase> hmm
[15:43:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: well first lets revert back to the cleaner way
[15:44:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> second why are all the divs hidden?
[15:44:47] <hlve> it gets hit with a show() when they get past a certain point.
[15:45:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[15:45:20] <sunbeam> is it possible to have a gradient background AND an image at the same time?

[15:46:01] <hlve> lol
[15:46:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: beat you to it :P
[15:46:17] <hlve> =p
[15:46:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: okay so im gonna rewrite code to remove redudency
[15:46:33] <hlve> alright
[15:47:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: http://jsfiddle.net/rohanbhangui/cgxnB/1/
[15:47:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> tell me if it works
[15:47:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: if your showing only 1 of the export links based on certain data
[15:47:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> apply the display: none to each element
[15:48:04] <Rohan_Bhangui> you can do this in css
[15:48:08] <hlve> alright
[15:48:10] <hlve> sec.
[15:48:19] <hlve> let me test this sexy code out! thank you btw.
[15:48:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> something like this

[15:51:54] <hlve> no luck yet. trying to see where it's getting stuck.
[15:51:55] <hlve> sec
[15:52:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> k
[16:00:17] <hlve> nada. not important. I'll proly tackle this again in our next build. This is taking too long to debug lol.
[16:00:23] <hlve> thanks for trying though homie
[16:05:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> whats the issue
[16:05:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> the code is flawless
[16:05:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> it work
[16:05:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> whether you do it redundent way or not
[16:06:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> hlve: lets solve this

[16:07:32] <Atlantic777> jphase: argh, order of declaring js files in html. -.-
[16:07:47] <jphase> doh
[16:08:55] <b-lew> Is there a way to say if window.innerWidth > 1000 don't appendTo?
[16:09:49] <Atlantic777> b-lew: are you trying to make your design responsive? CSS queries are handy...
[16:10:13] <b-lew> Yes, I am. But I have to adjust the DOM to combine 2 menus into 1
[16:10:16] <b-lew> if that makes sense.
[16:10:41] <Atlantic777> It perfectly makes sense and I think that it's common to use CSS media queries for such things.
[16:11:04] <b-lew> Here is an exampleâ¦
[16:11:05] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/8368225
[16:11:41] <b-lew> I have to appendTo because otherwise the navigation has the logo between the 2 navigations.
[16:12:45] <Atlantic777> b-lew: http://media02.hongkiat.com/responsive-web-nav/demo/index.html
[16:15:02] <Atlantic777> b-lew: something like this link? ^
[16:15:25] <b-lew> I'm looking into it.
[16:16:01] <Atlantic777> here's complete tutorial http://www.hongkiat.com/blog/responsive-web-nav/
[16:17:36] <b-lew> Here is my full file.
[16:17:37] <b-lew> http://pastie.org/8368232
[16:18:00] <b-lew> as of right now it works the way I want it too. But, when I resize back out it's still appended.
[16:19:52] <b-lew> humm doesn't work on initial load though.
[16:20:23] <b-lew> Thinking...
[16:45:47] <sayd> how could i make an assignment like: { foo: null || 'foo' }
[16:46:24] <duch_kazatel> sayd huh?
[16:46:51] <duch_kazatel> like, create property foo if it doesn't exist?
[16:47:11] <sayd> duch_kazatel: no like in that case null would be maybe defined
[16:47:46] <duch_kazatel> "null would be maybe defined"?
[16:47:58] <sayd> it would be something like options = options || {}; return { foo: options.foo || null }
[16:48:09] <sayd> maybe that is clearer
[16:49:26] <sayd> hm, it does seem to work. just prints null in the console so its confusing
[16:49:43] <duch_kazatel> the question you're asking is very strange.  what's the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[16:50:32] <sayd> i want the optional value to be used inside a function which is passed options
[16:50:49] <duch_kazatel> aaah you want default values?
[16:50:49] <sayd> so function (options) { console.log(options.foo || 'foo') }
[16:50:51] <sayd> basically
[16:51:54] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[16:52:40] <duch_kazatel> that should help get you part of the way.
[16:54:01] <sayd> duch_kazatel: thanks i didnt know about the , stuff
[16:54:15] <duch_kazatel> "the , stuff"?
[16:55:08] <sayd> settings values as the last thing evaluated after the last comma operator
[16:55:28] <sayd> var x = false ? true, 1 : null
[16:55:35] <sayd> x==1
[16:55:45] <sayd> err...
[16:55:52] <duch_kazatel> lol i think you're confused.
[16:55:52] <sayd> x = null there, sorry im fried today
[16:56:02] <duch_kazatel> and that's not the comma, that's the ternary.
[16:57:00] <joeykeys> hi folks
[16:58:29] <sayd> duch_kazatel: true ? (true, 1) : null
[16:58:37] <sayd> returns 1
[16:58:47] <sayd> i guess that was my discovery
[16:58:51] <duch_kazatel> without seeing your code, I have no idea what you're doing.
[17:00:17] <joeykeys> if i have a json response that has another layer within it, how do i get down to that level?
[17:00:19] <joeykeys> http://pastebin.com/Vn9suD8W
[17:00:45] <joeykeys> for a better explanation of what I'm trying to do. basically, looping through a json response, which is shown there, i want to be able to get "pickupquote"
[17:01:49] <jphase> joeykeys: you need to use nested $.each() statements
[17:02:02] <joeykeys> so another each inside of my each?
[17:02:05] <jphase> yeah
[17:02:24] <joeykeys> what do i pass/set?
[17:02:27] <joeykeys> thats what is throwing me.
[17:02:40] <jphase> hmm, whaddya mean by that exactly?
[17:02:58] <joeykeys> like in my first each
[17:02:59] <sayd> $.each(post.partsAvailability, function() {})
[17:03:09] <joeykeys> yeah thats what i meant
[17:03:14] <jphase> oh gotcha
[17:03:37] <joeykeys> so the [i] is already set
[17:03:41] <joeykeys> so thats why i can just say post.?
[17:03:49] <jphase> yeah
[17:03:54] <Assimilater> I'm concerned about the load for this page despite my attempts to effectively use ajax it causes near browser crashing (which I thought ajax was meant to help me avoid), any pointers on what I can do to help this page load more smoothly? http://dot.aquaveo.com/
[17:04:04] <joeykeys> and function can be left blank?
[17:04:06] <jphase> well, your objectname.propertyname yeah
[17:04:22] <jphase> function is just appended to a new line, and you can do .each's inside of that if you need to as well
[17:05:00] <Assimilater> the bulk of the page load is a result of the aveo.Nodes.js file  with the recursive getTab method declared on line 197 and triggered on line 253
[17:05:27] <joeykeys> hm I'm a little confuse phase
[17:05:33] <joeykeys> jphase
[17:05:52] <jphase> sup?
[17:05:54] <joeykeys> console.log(post.partsAvailability.pickupQuote); is undefined
[17:06:05] <joeykeys> i think I'm confused on how this is supposed to work
[17:06:16] <jphase> you're skipping one level i think joeykeys
[17:06:24] <joeykeys> ah
[17:06:34] <joeykeys> ok yeah i see something odd if i just log partsAvailability
[17:06:46] <jphase> stores[0].partsAvailability for example is the first one
[17:06:57] <jphase> so if you .each through your stores, then you can use $(this).partsAvailability
[17:07:07] <jphase> (inside your .each)
[17:07:31] <joeykeys> jphase: er sorry lost me.
[17:07:35] <jphase> hehe, sec
[17:07:56] <joeykeys> this is where I'm at right now: http://pastebin.com/abqmZ8EM
[17:09:52] <Assimilater> joeykeys: what does that console log show?
[17:10:28] <joeykeys> Assimilater: 	Object {2374813s: Object}
[17:10:51] <Assimilater> joeykeys: from your first pace it looks like you would expect to use .partsAvailability['2374813s'].pickupQuote then
[17:11:10] <Assimilater> joeykeys: and the console confirms it
[17:11:41] <__machine> doug65536: i just checked the OPTIONS request is being handled correctly and its response is 200 OK... so returning a 302 to a preflight request is not happening... so that's not the error...
[17:11:43] <joeykeys> you got it
[17:11:54] <joeykeys> how can i not pass 2374813
[17:12:15] <jphase> joeykeys: http://jsfiddle.net/KwjR9/
[17:12:17] <jphase> something like that
[17:12:25] <jphase> not quite what you need I'm sure, but that's an example
[17:12:26] <Assimilater> joeykeys: modify your json
[17:12:32] <__machine> Cork: did you play around with cors requests generating redirects not being followed ?
[17:12:45] <joeykeys> Assimilater: not able to =\
[17:12:51] <joeykeys> jphase: thank you taking a look
[17:13:04] <Assimilater> joeykeys: if a store has multiple parts then isn't pickupQuote only relevant to a given part anyways?
[17:13:31] <doug65536> __machine: ok
[17:13:53] <joeykeys> Assimilater: what do you mean
[17:15:42] <Assimilater> joeykeys: well, you have partsAvailability presumably as a list of many products that are offerent that have different quotes, unless you assume each store only sells one product you'd be trying to show a blanket price for everything otherwise....
[17:15:53] <jphase> Assimilater: you have quite a lot of data going on here hehe
[17:16:21] <joeykeys> yes but thats why i dontwant to have to pass in the part number my self
[17:16:35] <joeykeys> the only way i can get it to work right now is by manually entering the part number into the loop
[17:17:01] <Assimilater> jphase: yes, I'm trying to test the server when there's thousands of points on the map, i stopped at 300 because the load was a lot
[17:17:06] <jphase> joeykeys: you can grab the part number with the loop I gave you
[17:17:21] <joeykeys> i was thinking if i could do something instead of console.log(post.partsAvailability['ME307LL/A'].pickupQuote); like console.log(post.partsAvailability[post.partsAvailabiity].pickupQuote);
[17:18:01] <jphase> joeykeys: did you look at the console in the example I sent you?
[17:18:10] <joeykeys> no let me try now
[17:18:30] <Assimilater> joeykeys: like jphase showed you you need to loop through that extra layer, this will give you a function that executes for each product rather than entering a specific product
[17:18:52] <jphase> joeykeys: ^  what he said, and then you use the index in the second loop for example
[17:19:14] <joeykeys> looking at the log now
[17:20:48] <Assimilater> i'm thinking (for my server situation) I may need to switch to a different plugin like data tables and just loading 50 or so calculators at a time may be the way to go
[17:20:54] <joeykeys> shit man im confused..
[17:21:37] <jphase> joeykeys: so in the first loop it loops through all the stores... index is 0, 1, 2, etc. and value is the object of data
[17:21:51] <joeykeys> ahhh
[17:21:55] <joeykeys> so i need to add index
[17:21:57] <jphase> joeykeys: in the second loop it loops through partsAvailability, index is "2374813s"
[17:21:59] <joeykeys> to my 2nd loop
[17:22:03] <jphase> yeah
[17:22:21] <joeykeys> awesome awesome awesome
[17:22:30] <joeykeys> thank you!
[17:22:32] <jphase> you could alternatively write a recursive function that does all this for you but that's a bit more advanced
[17:22:33] <jphase> np
[17:22:37] <Assimilater> joeykeys: maybe this update will help you see: http://jsfiddle.net/KwjR9/2/
[17:22:38] <Assimilater> oh nvm
[17:22:40] <jphase> gotta jet guys, ciao for now :)
[17:22:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase:
[17:22:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> fuck
[17:23:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> missed him
[17:23:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahh well
[17:47:43] <Decalmo> if I want a function to respond to every ID that shares the correct name, and not just the FIRST ID that has that name... what i do?
[17:47:46] <Decalmo> :D
[17:48:19] <Phoenixz> I'm using a jquery-ui accordeon and try to add an extra element to it, after which I should do $("theaccordeonselector").accordeon("refresh"); but then I get this error: Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on accordion prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'
[17:48:54] <Phoenixz> Tried google, but so far I have not found any useful resolutions, anybody here an idea?
[17:50:25] <goldr046> decalmo: IDs are supposed to be unique, you can change the ID to class
[17:50:41] <Decalmo> its funny because I literally just came to that revelation
[17:50:47] <Decalmo> whups, duh
[17:50:50] <Decalmo> thanks goldr046!
[17:50:55] <goldr046> np
[17:51:15] <goldr046> phoenixz: wait until a later time to try to refresh
[17:51:35] <Phoenixz> goldr046: ah, like using setTimeout?
[17:51:36] <goldr046> try wrapping the refresh in $(window).load()
[17:51:45] <goldr046> setTimeout is best avoided
[17:52:28] <goldr046> you're probably calling it from $(document).ready(), but $(window).load() would happen at a later time, when you could be sure that the accordion has been initialized
[17:53:00] <Phoenixz> goldr046: mmm, no, I think there is a misunderstanding here.. The accordeon works perfectly normally (and I use it in a document.ready call)
[17:53:06] <Phoenixz> the problem starts when I add a new element
[17:53:14] <Phoenixz> then the new element does not work yet
[17:53:41] <Phoenixz> and supposedly I have to add $("foobar").accordeon("refresh"); but once I do that, I get that error
[17:53:47] <Phoenixz> the onload works w/o problem
[17:54:36] <goldr046> you typically save the accordion to a variable, which you use at a later time to make changes to the plugin's state
[17:55:02] <Phoenixz> a crap, I found the problem, a typo in the class selector... I was trying to refresh a non existing accordeon...
[17:55:04] <Phoenixz> my bad..
[17:55:05] <goldr046> something like var myAccordion = $('#foo').accordion();
[17:55:05] <__machine> doug65536: non preflighted cors request does follow redirect... but as soon as it is preflighted it doesnt follow...
[17:55:16] <goldr046> oh
[17:56:02] <goldr046> anyway, you could save the accordion instance in myAccordion, and then later on you can just call myAccordion.refresh()
[18:23:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: how goes it
[18:24:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> i8igmac: load time is a bit better
[18:51:52] <Decalmo> ive got a div id that sits outside of the AJAX div that gets updated with links and forms... problem is when I submit a form, then get a new link on that page, the link no longer responds to AJAX properly
[18:53:25] <jphase> Decalmo: you have a working example online by chance?
[18:53:35] <Decalmo> heh sorry not at the moment
[18:53:42] <Decalmo> lemem poop something out real quiock
[18:55:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: welcome back
[18:55:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> any news
[18:56:05] <jphase> nah, but he hasn't really been on the map lately, his nick has had a |away suffix for 3 days now
[18:56:14] <jphase> however, it might be best for you to just apply
[18:56:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> hes on irc?
[18:56:21] <jphase> yeah
[18:56:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> name?
[18:56:31] <Decalmo> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/gzb5r/
[18:56:39] <Decalmo> thanks again for the help. you certainly rule.
[18:56:59] <jphase> hehe, it'd be pretty awkward if you hit him up since he doesn't really know you, but he's in another chan with me atm
[18:57:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[18:57:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> fine
[18:57:13] <jphase> afk for 3 days though as I said
[18:57:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[18:57:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> nw
[18:57:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> thing is if i apply
[18:57:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> than i will be like ther est
[18:57:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> *rest
[18:57:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: how you do that
[18:57:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> text on my end is green
[18:57:59] <jphase> you type /notice jphase hi there <3
[18:58:11] <jphase> makes it so it can show on your screen without the msg window in most clients
[18:58:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[18:58:25] <Decalmo> oh whats this little feature you guys are talking about?
[18:58:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> Decalmo: watch
[18:58:38] <jphase> oh just a native irc command
[18:58:48] <jphase> noticing vs msging
[18:58:56] <Decalmo> oh crazy
[18:59:01] <Decalmo> is that just specificalyl aimed at me?
[18:59:05] <jphase> yeah
[18:59:08] <jphase> you can also chan notice
[18:59:09] <Decalmo> very spiffy
[18:59:14] <jphase> if the mode is enabled on the chan
[18:59:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> when i ping someone i just tpye there name
[18:59:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then a colon
[18:59:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then say what i want
[18:59:37] <jphase> yeah, that's how most chat clients will auto complete and when you do that for me a red bubble pops up on my dock
[18:59:39] <Decalmo> is there a way to get have an alert when someone else is typing... for isntance if I wanted to flag responses from someone?
[18:59:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: bet it will piss alot of epople off
[18:59:45] <jphase> yeah
[18:59:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> how?
[18:59:58] <jphase> if you use like mIRC on windows, for instance, you can create a remote script event
[19:00:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya im on chatzilla
[19:00:09] <Decalmo> very cool.
[19:00:11] <jphase> it's like /remote or ALT + R to bring it up or something
[19:00:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> interesting
[19:00:17] <Decalmo> very cool
[19:00:19] * jphase hasn't used windows in many moons
[19:00:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[19:00:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> dont bother
[19:00:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> win8 is crap
[19:00:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> meant for tablets
[19:00:35] <jphase> "tcl scripting" is the language, which is syntactically idential to JS
[19:00:39] <jphase> identical*
[19:00:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then ported for desktop
[19:00:41] <Decalmo> oh no way
[19:00:44] <jphase> yeah
[19:00:45] <Decalmo> very cool
[19:01:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: as i was saying most hiring is done internally/through well known "aquaintances"
[19:01:08] <jphase> you can create your own commands too with /alias...   /alias jphase /msg jphase $1
[19:01:15] <jphase> that will make /jphase hi msg me
[19:01:34] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: that's your advantages
[19:01:52] <jphase> you have the in, you just need to put your paperwork through.
[19:01:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> differnce between msg and /ntoice
[19:01:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> *notice
[19:02:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> kk
[19:02:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> where can i find their applcaition
[19:02:18] <jphase> notice shows up on most clients on any window they're in without a msg window
[19:02:25] <jphase> on mine it has a msg window and shows up wherever I'm at
[19:02:29] <Decalmo> cool.
[19:02:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[19:02:57] <jphase> you can also do channel wide notices, which are disabled in most default channel modes cause it can be used to spam
[19:03:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[19:03:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> good
[19:04:21] <Decalmo> hahah more stuff to read!
[19:04:25] <Decalmo> in the bedtimes
[19:04:30] <Decalmo> rad.
[19:04:35] <jphase> inorite? too many scripts, too little time
[19:04:40] <Decalmo> its so insane
[19:04:42] <Decalmo> its like the rabbit hole
[19:04:49] <Decalmo> i go to bed, thinking im going to learn something new before i sleep
[19:04:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: found it kinda http://hire.jobvite.com/Jobvite/Job.aspx?j=oO8OXfwr&c=qSa9VfwQ
[19:04:57] <jphase> l8r
[19:05:01] <Decalmo> and then I just open up some brand new cans of worms
[19:05:07] <jphase> yep
[19:05:11] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: that's the one
[19:05:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmm not an intern ship but a job
[19:05:27] <Decalmo> jphase: not sure if you had a chance to look at the little problem I was running into: http://jsfiddle.net/gzb5r/
[19:05:58] <Decalmo> basically the links properly submit via AJAX, but once I load a form in the #frame, submit it and return, the links wont work
[19:06:01] <jphase> Decalmo: I'd need the data set from the server side
[19:06:12] <jphase> oh
[19:06:18] <jphase> is this just printing out a string by chance?
[19:07:08] <Decalmo> um... well I've got the container div, and that holds some content which I use AJAX to GET new content intot he #frame div
[19:07:16] <Decalmo> sometimes the #frame div will hold a form
[19:07:20] <Decalmo> which also submits via AJAX
[19:07:22] <Decalmo> (and works)
[19:07:23] <jphase> k
[19:07:26] <jphase> hah, nice
[19:07:29] <Decalmo> and then the #frame reloads the content from before
[19:07:30] <Decalmo> haha yea
[19:07:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: let me know once your don with Decalmo got some stuff to ask
[19:07:46] <Decalmo> (sorry Rohan)
[19:07:47] <jphase> sure
[19:08:09] <Decalmo> so basically the exact same link that would have properly used AJAX to GET the form, then submit the form and come back
[19:08:24] <Decalmo> that link when you return, will try to just load regularly, sans the AJAX
[19:08:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> Decalmo: its not about jquery thats why im gonna wait
[19:08:54] <Decalmo> :-D thanks man
[19:09:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> np bro
[19:09:09] <jphase> Decalmo: so what's the issue with it?
[19:09:15] <jphase> still hard to test without front and back end data
[19:09:22] <Decalmo> yea im sorry... tricky to put it all in
[19:09:26] <jphase> all good
[19:09:27] <Decalmo> i think the DOM isn't resetting or something
[19:09:30] <jphase> you're doing a .get
[19:09:39] <Decalmo> yea, the link would first be, say, "edit"
[19:09:42] <jphase> so just hit the same URL in your browser and you can copy/paste the data into a var
[19:09:43] <jphase> or sumpin
[19:09:46] <Decalmo> and then the GET would grab the form to edit that item
[19:09:54] <jphase> k
[19:10:02] <Decalmo> after the form is submitted,
[19:10:11] <jphase> and are you still using my .AJAXify method for all this madness?
[19:10:24] <Decalmo> I'm using something a little different that's working
[19:10:27] <Decalmo> I combined yours
[19:10:31] <Decalmo> with my old one
[19:10:38] <jphase> okay, you're crazy haha
[19:10:41] <jphase> but sounds fun
[19:10:42] <jphase> continue
[19:10:44] <Decalmo> hahah
[19:10:47] <Decalmo> its working SO far...
[19:10:48] <jphase> issue currently is?
[19:10:50] <Decalmo> except for this chunk :(
[19:10:59] <Decalmo> yea lemme start over, I'll make more sense this time.
[19:11:00] <jphase> what's not working exactly?
[19:11:03] <hlve> anyone know of any good jquery/css3 animations that mimic the Genie effect on mac?
[19:11:16] <hlve> (the opening, and closing window anim.)
[19:11:30] <jphase> hmmm
[19:11:33] <jphase> haven't seen one of those yet
[19:11:45] <jphase> lemme know if you find one in your searches though pls hlve
[19:11:49] <Decalmo> hlve: these are pretty easy to work with, but aren't genie effect specifically
[19:11:49] <Decalmo> http://daneden.me/animate/
[19:12:26] <jphase> Decalmo: so what's not working with this code chunk exactly, describe it in a sentence
[19:12:53] <Decalmo> this code chunk works perfectly the "first time"
[19:12:56] <hlve> saw this earlier. I wonder how much i could manipulate it to come close
[19:12:56] <hlve> lol
[19:13:05] <Decalmo> hlve: probly pretty well
[19:13:12] <Decalmo> hlve: CSS3 animations are pretty awesome
[19:13:27] <Decalmo> jphase: the chunk works perfectly the "first time"
[19:13:28] <jphase> Decalmo:  and subsequent times, what breaks exactly?
[19:13:36] <Decalmo> it loads the link like a normal link
[19:13:39] <Decalmo> and NOT in the #frame div
[19:14:12] <jphase> hmm
[19:14:20] <Decalmo> the link the first time opens a form in the #frame div... that form gets submitted, then returns back the original content in the #frame (includiong the link to edit again)
[19:14:29] <jphase> and on your server side script... it's just echoing out an HTML string?
[19:14:36] <Decalmo> yea thats right
[19:14:40] <jphase> !api jQuery.parseHTML
[19:14:40] <b-ot> jphase: No matches.
[19:14:43] <jphase> bah
[19:14:49] <jphase> $.parseHTML(data)
[19:14:49] <Decalmo> i think its the DOM
[19:14:51] <jphase> instead of data
[19:14:52] <Decalmo> is my guess
[19:15:11] <jphase> like...
[19:15:32] <jphase> instead of   $('#frame').html(data)  try    $('#frame').append($.parseHTML(data))
[19:15:45] <Decalmo> ok lemme give that a go
[19:15:46] <jphase> to start with, that will make it all jQuery DOM objecty and better to work with
[19:15:49] <Decalmo> and thanks for bearing with me :)
[19:16:12] <jphase> all good, just hard to imagine without seeing it
[19:16:19] <Decalmo> totally :{
[19:17:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> :{ <--- reminds me of the pringles dude
[19:17:07] <jphase> lol
[19:17:11] <jphase> totally
[19:17:12] <Decalmo> hahah
[19:21:08] <Decalmo> jphase: thats a rad feature... the append
[19:21:18] <Decalmo> however, it's still buggering here :(
[19:21:21] <Decalmo> lemme tinker around
[19:21:24] <Decalmo> I'll leave ya be :)
[19:21:32] <jphase> oh, append might not work with what you're doing too, I'm nubbing
[19:21:47] <Decalmo> I like it though! I do!
[19:21:55] <jphase> you can do .html() to replace like you were before, but keep the parsing for good measure
[19:22:06] <Decalmo> k
[19:22:18] <jphase> you can also do .contents() too I believe with that parse wrapper
[19:22:43] <Decalmo> what does parse do?
[19:22:48] <jphase> let me write up something that I think will work for you
[19:22:55] <jphase> just takes a string and converts it to a DOM object
[19:23:07] <Decalmo> alrighty schweet
[19:23:08] <jphase> just like when you do like $.parseJSON() too for example but with HTML
[19:24:17] <__machine> jphase: doug65536: Cork: http://test.office.3030.com.au:1704/test/ simplest example demonstrating the problem... one button to submit a preflighted CORS request that doesnt work and another that submits a simple CORS request that does work... both return a 302 redirect in response to the actual request (not the preflight request) but the redirect is not followed
[19:33:02] <jphase> Decalmo: This is one possible way that I'd do what you're doing: http://jsfiddle.net/gzb5r/1/
[19:33:10] <Decalmo> k checking it out
[19:33:12] <Decalmo> thanks
[19:34:32] <Decalmo> ok schweet lemme give this a go
[19:44:50] <DofLeFou_> Greetings room
[19:46:03] <jphase> greetings scriptling
[19:48:43] <DofLeFou_> Dear jQuery Gods, I have a slight issue using with the following http://jsfiddle.net/urJDT/ in Knockout aware view
[19:49:14] <DofLeFou_> the issue is .load(url)
[19:49:37] <jphase> DofLeFou_: is the URL you're loading allowing Access Control of any domain?
[19:49:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol Jquery Gods
[19:50:00] <DofLeFou_> since the view that is beeing loaded is a knockout js aware view
[19:50:54] <jphase> DofLeFou_: the remote URL will need to have something like this in their .htaccess (or globally in their apache settings):    Header add Access-Control-Allow-Origin "http://domain1.com"
[19:51:03] <DofLeFou_> .load doesnot load the view (URL)
[19:51:19] <DofLeFou_> jphase .... it has security access
[19:51:23] <jphase> yeah
[19:51:35] <jphase> did you read what I said up there ^
[19:51:38] <DofLeFou_> they are all on the same domain
[19:51:41] <jphase> oh
[19:52:00] <jphase> that's problematic
[19:52:05] <DofLeFou_> url .... is actually /ControllerName/Action
[19:52:25] <DofLeFou_> with render a partial view
[19:52:26] <jphase> okay, but on the same domain?
[19:52:39] <DofLeFou_> Single Page App
[19:53:11] <jphase> DofLeFou_: the URLs are all on the same domain yes?
[19:53:18] <DofLeFou_> jphase: yes
[19:53:23] <jphase> k
[19:53:27] <jphase> that shouldn't be an issue then
[19:53:48] <jphase> DofLeFou_: is the event even firing?  can you console.log('foobar'); in that function and see it?
[19:53:51] <DofLeFou_> I think it the knockout pieace of it
[19:56:09] <DofLeFou_> jphase see what the content of URL look like http://jsfiddle.net/urJDT/1/
[19:58:06] <DofLeFou_> the issue I beleive calling .load(...) , with all that script in there
[19:58:18] <jphase> DofLeFou_: I see no <ul class="sub"> in this markup
[19:59:03] <DofLeFou_> it is in my master layout
[20:00:20] <DofLeFou_> .load(url) ... dynamcally inject a view into my master layout
[20:00:29] <jphase> k
[20:00:46] <jphase> and did you try to console.log('test'); in that event to make sure it's firing on click?
[20:01:04] <DofLeFou_> I didn't want my App to reload everytime I click on any of my li <ul class="sub">
[20:01:22] <DofLeFou_> jphase ... I can confirm it firing
[20:01:30] <jphase> k
[20:01:37] <DofLeFou_> and actually it loading the url content
[20:01:44] <jphase> oh okay, so what's the problem lol?
[20:01:47] <DofLeFou_> but none of the Script content
[20:01:52] <jphase> hmm
[20:02:05] <jphase> so there's some <script> tags in there that don't work correctly?
[20:02:10] <DofLeFou_> http://jsfiddle.net/urJDT/1/
[20:02:16] <DofLeFou_> they dont load at all
[20:02:56] <DofLeFou_> my question was .... is it even recomment to use .load(..) on some content that has script
[20:03:02] <jphase> well firstly, this is the very first time I've ever seen a <script> tag used for HTML
[20:03:24] <DofLeFou_> I was reading somewere it could lead to some memroy leak
[20:03:30] <jphase> I know it is a valid type, just I'm not used to it
[20:03:42] <DofLeFou_> Knockout JS
[20:04:02] <jphase> okay, that's the part I'm not getting, but okay, so the content inside the script tags doesn't load?
[20:04:17] <DofLeFou_> exact
[20:04:33] <DofLeFou_> is this some restriction with .load(...)
[20:04:35] <jphase> DofLeFou_: sounds like your parser (Knockout) is not parsing
[20:05:06] <jphase> like it literally has something like this in the div right?:       @Html.Partial("~/Views/Shared/_ValidationErrors.cshtml")
[20:05:31] <DofLeFou_> Razor
[20:05:45] <DofLeFou_> That s some razor syntax
[20:05:59] <DofLeFou_> the parser it working correctly
[20:06:19] <jphase> oh okay
[20:06:29] <jphase> I'm not used to these two libs :`[
[20:06:59] <DofLeFou_> okay
[20:07:27] <DofLeFou_> but some the problem this is what is going on
[20:07:51] <DofLeFou_> abd I thought to come ask the jQuery GODs ... in this room .. lol
[20:09:55] <jphase> hehe, it's still sort of tough to wrap my head around it as I'm not used to any of this stuff. Someone else may know
[20:10:09] <jphase> pretty neat the way this works though, was reading up on it a bit
[20:10:23] <tw2113> Zuul, is that you calling?
[20:10:54] <DofLeFou_> jphase ... I m just starting with it too
[20:11:07] <jphase> haha
[20:11:11] <DofLeFou_> been away from the web stuff for a while now
[20:11:26] <DofLeFou_> ... but this MVVM and knockout crack is good
[20:14:26] <aro> is there a way to make a nicer 'confirm' box with jquery?
[20:18:00] <DofLeFou_> jphase: here is what I found out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5467221/jquery-load-doesnt-load-script
[20:18:27] <DofLeFou_> aro: define nice
[20:18:50] <jphase> > than alert()
[20:19:01] <jphase> aro: jQuery UI is one of many
[20:21:32] <aro> well i wanted to do something using bootstraps modal()
[20:21:51] <aro> similar to: if (confirm('are you sure?')) { }
[20:22:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> aro: than use bootstrap
[20:22:14] <aro> it doesnt have anything like this
[20:22:35] <aro> i found an example that uses $.dialog() and $.Deferred()
[20:22:44] <aro> but not sure how to apply it to modal
[20:22:52] <jphase> .modal
[20:22:55] <jphase> for jQuery UI
[20:23:09] <jphase> or wait
[20:23:17] <jphase> is it just a part of .dialog?
[20:23:21] <jphase> haven't used it in awhile
[20:23:21] <aro> no
[20:23:22] <jphase> http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/dialog/modal.html
[20:23:30] <aro> im not using jqueryui
[20:23:35] <jphase> oh
[20:24:01] <jphase> you could just make your own then, it's realllllly easy to do
[20:24:13] <jphase> I mean, you can add a plugin or library if you want too
[20:25:32] <aro> ok
[20:26:05] <boytoy> aro: what about jquery mobile then?
[20:27:01] <aro> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13758928/jquery-deferred-and-dialog-box/18474005#18474005
[20:27:13] <aro> i found that,  trying to use that with bootstrap
[20:27:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey aro
[20:27:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> why not build your own
[20:27:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> then you can get custom effect
[20:28:59] <boytoy> Rohan_Bhangui: the future is mobile, and there's just too many bug fixes for earlier mobile platforms involved in building your own
[20:29:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> boytoy: agree with the second mart dont really agree with stuff going mobile
[20:29:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> :P
[20:30:49] <boytoy> well
[20:30:50] <jphase> meh, modals are pretty easy to be cross-platform imo
[20:31:15] <boytoy> if i take public transport all i see are young ladies bickering with their smartphones
[20:31:18] <jphase> depends on your priority, mine is load time so < libs are good for me
[20:31:23] <jphase> haha
[20:31:50] <boytoy> and accessing your bank via mobile just became more popular than accessing your bank via your computer
[20:32:11] <boytoy> and also, if you go to sub-saharan africa, there's not a single pc, only hordes of mobiles
[20:32:28] <jphase> oh there's no denying mobile is the future
[20:32:44] <jphase> or more accurately the present
[20:32:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> hmmmm
[20:33:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> while that is true
[20:33:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> i still think there will always be a need for a pc
[20:33:17] <boytoy> yeah i guess you could say we're there already :p
[20:33:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> whether a desktop or laptop
[20:33:32] <boytoy> Rohan_Bhangui: theres no arguing with that
[20:33:44] <Decalmo> jphase: problem solved
[20:33:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> just think aobut what we devlop on
[20:33:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> will that move to mobile
[20:33:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dont think so
[20:34:01] <Decalmo> you're going to kick my face for having explained poorly earlier
[20:34:21] <Decalmo> hahah
[20:34:38] <boytoy> Rohan_Bhangui: out of every 1 million people theres only 1 developer, unfortunately nobody really cares about that chap
[20:34:48] * jphase o_0
[20:34:50] <boytoy> but i see your point
[20:35:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> as i do see yours
[20:35:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think mobile has more potential than what it is currently being used for
[20:35:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> but thats what i get agry with
[20:35:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> *angy
[20:35:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> *angry
[20:35:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> people have no respect for people like us
[20:35:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> devlopers
[20:35:52] <boytoy> hehe :P
[20:35:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> *developers
[20:36:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> man my spelling is off today
[20:36:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> and the people that do care, care only about "wow i pressed this button and this cool thing popped up". I f***ing hate those people
[20:37:17] <boytoy> :D
[20:37:22] <boytoy> well ur the dev
[20:37:39] <boytoy> you have superpowers, you could make that button blow up their cellphone if you'd like :p
[20:39:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[20:39:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> eactly
[20:39:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> what israel did to a terrorist leader in the 70s
[20:39:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think
[20:40:11] <Decalmo> jphase: basically before I was using $('#id').click(function() {
[20:40:29] <aro> i got it
[20:40:32] <Decalmo> but what I needed was $('#id_container').on("click", "#id", function(){
[20:40:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> boytoy: one more thing tends to threaten us developers
[20:40:47] <Decalmo> because when new links were loaded into the DOM, they weren't getting asigned the jQuery properties or whatever
[20:40:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> boytoy: those click and drag based website builders or website builders in general
[20:40:55] <Decalmo> anywhooooo solved. so yay.
[20:40:59] <Decalmo> and many thanks for the help
[20:40:59] <jphase> Decalmo: ahh, you needed bubbling
[20:41:03] <Decalmo> yeeeeaaa
[20:41:04] <jphase> np
[20:41:07] <Decalmo> them dang bubbles!
[20:41:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[20:41:13] <Decalmo> but y'know what
[20:41:17] <jphase> hehe, still a confusing part of jQuery for me to this day
[20:41:18] <Decalmo> I learned a whole bunch more in the processs
[20:41:28] <Decalmo> well you showed me functions
[20:41:34] <Decalmo> as well as appending HTML
[20:41:36] <Decalmo> so I'm stoked on that
[20:41:40] <Decalmo> more tools for the toolkit
[20:41:44] <boytoy> Rohan_Bhangui: true
[20:41:44] <Decalmo> cheers, mates
[20:41:47] <jphase> hehe, sure man
[20:41:48] <Decalmo> I'm gonna go grab some dinner now
[20:41:53] <jphase> ciao
[20:41:56] <Decalmo> ciao
[20:41:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> see you soon Decalmo
[20:42:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> btw has anyone gotten a chance to test the ebta google web designer
[20:42:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> 8beta
[20:42:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> *beta
[20:45:36] <boytoy> cool didnt know about that one
[20:45:44] <boytoy> looks like photoshop
[20:47:47] <dblosevn> Hey, got a crazy issue, Im building a phonegap app with jqm, and I do my own processing of pages by preventingdefault on pagebeforeload, which is working great but theres one instance in the app where I might have to cancel the load and remain on the same page and display a dialog (No videos available) now from reading the docs it says to simply reject the deferred and the page load will be
[20:47:47] <dblosevn> canceled. Now the problem... it properaly cancels the load when I reject the deferred and displays the alert dialog. But... If you click videos again its lke it pulls the page (that I never resolved) from cache and the code to determine if I should reject the page or not does not run.
[20:50:09] <jphase> odd
[20:50:46] <dblosevn> now if I click 2 other links then return to the main menu it does show the dialog again
[20:51:12] <dblosevn> has to be at least 2 other links though so thats whats making me think cache
[20:51:27] <jphase> dblosevn: it'd be somewhat tough to debug that without seeing it, you happen to try returning false instead of preventDefault?
[20:52:04] <jphase> well, quickest way to test if it's cache is to just clear it and try to reproduce I'd think
[20:52:21] <dblosevn> I can show the code but it wont work outside of app :-(
[20:52:29] <jphase> oh right, phonegapped
[20:52:32] <jphase> hmm
[20:52:47] <jphase> can you clear cache inside the app?
[20:53:01] <jphase> I've never done that b4
[20:53:02] <dblosevn> I tried navigator.app.clearCache();
[20:53:09] <jphase> ahh, still no dice?
[20:53:15] <dblosevn> but I think its a jqm cache
[20:53:20] <dblosevn> not browser cache
[20:53:26] <jphase> if that's the case then you can refresh the page object
[20:53:32] <dblosevn> I had issues with it before
[20:53:50] <dblosevn> I tired reloading the current page before showing the dialog
[20:54:03] <jphase> dang
[20:54:24] <jphase> well reloading or refreshing?
[20:54:24] <dblosevn> Dont really want to get stupid with it and reload the page 3 times lol
[20:54:30] <jphase> yeah
[20:54:33] <jphase> that's not optimal
[20:54:46] <jphase> just would confirm or deny your cache theories
[20:54:47] <dblosevn> appending a timestamp to the end of the url and $.mobile.changepage
[20:54:51] <jphase> trying to eliminate the possibilities
[20:55:06] <jphase> man, you've already done a few tricks then...
[20:55:14] <jphase> hmm
[20:55:28] <dblosevn> I never ask until im ready to throw my laptop through the wall lmao
[20:55:43] <boytoy> hehe
[20:56:13] <dblosevn> I can show you a remote debugger so you can watch as it happens
[20:56:25] <jphase> ohhh...
[20:56:27] <dblosevn> I have WEINRE configured
[20:56:42] <jphase> dblosevn: try this solution yet?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4660934/how-does-one-disable-caching-in-jquery-mobile-ui
[20:56:47] <jphase> it's old though
[20:56:52] <jphase> don't use .live, but maybe that will work?
[20:57:14] <jphase> or maybe the data-cache can just be set in the page itself?
[20:57:20] <jphase> in attr or with .data
[20:57:30] <dblosevn> the thing that gets me is the page is never injected in the dom
[20:57:42] <jphase> *cough* attr meaning .prop that is *cough*
[20:58:14] <dblosevn> so I cant remove the page that never got injected in the first place
[20:58:23] <jphase> well not the remove part...
[20:58:31] <jphase> more specifically the data-dom-cache="false" attribute in your page element
[20:58:51] <dblosevn> I could do that globally I guess
[20:59:07] <jphase> worth a shot at least to confirm or deny caching as the culprit
[20:59:35] <dblosevn> http://dblosevn.chosd.com/251
[20:59:39] <dblosevn> Thats my loader
[21:00:04] <jphase> nice
[21:00:17] <jphase> good syntax :D
[21:00:34] <dblosevn> wonder if I could hack that attrib in around line 112
[21:01:41] <hlve> why on earth wouldn't this work btw?	 $("#btn").click(function() { $("h1#header").text("Updated Header"); });
[21:01:42] <hlve> o_O
[21:02:26] <dblosevn> theres no element with id btn or your using jquery mobile and theres an element on the previous page that has the id btn
[21:02:51] <hlve> there's a div with an ID 'btn', and i'm using the latest jquery :(
[21:03:07] <dblosevn> ya but is there a div with the id btn on more then one page?
[21:03:40] <hlve> shouldn't really make a difference lol. I'm only calling it on the single page.
[21:03:47] <dblosevn> try $('#btn', $.mobile.activePage).click...
[21:03:56] <hlve> it's not a mobile page though
[21:04:01] <dblosevn> oh
[21:04:02] <jphase> not sure if hlve is using jqm
[21:04:11] <dblosevn> then your not putting it in dom ready
[21:04:51] <dblosevn> jQuery(function() { $('#btn').click(...);});
[21:05:15] <boytoy> How do I split a list of links into multiple liquid columns? Try #1 with JS: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/16/ -- too hackish, and only does two columns.
[21:05:18] <boytoy> Try #2 with CSS: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/17/ -- seems alright, but can't make the columns fluid.
[21:09:55] <jphase> boytoy: by columns fluid, do you mean display like a table does?
[21:10:24] <boytoy> jphase: kinda yeah..
[21:10:43] <jphase> boytoy: how cross-browser does this need to be?
[21:10:50] <boytoy> each link might have different length and so forth
[21:11:01] <boytoy> im all up for excluding IE =)
[21:11:09] <jphase> haha, good man
[21:11:29] <jphase> you should be able to do this with display: table and table-cell properties in CSS then no?
[21:11:38] <jphase> I mean, in lieu of doing it with jQuery that is
[21:11:51] <jphase> you could do it with jQuery easily but it does inline styling :\
[21:11:58] <jphase> which is actually cross-browser anyhow
[21:12:23] <boytoy> really just like that? lemme try
[21:12:52] <jphase> I think the rest of your column css is good, I haven't done this in awhile
[21:13:03] <jphase> I'd double check this on MDN
[21:13:20] <jphase> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display
[21:13:36] <jphase> I always have to look at that to reference and get divs to act like tables
[21:13:56] <jphase> but if that gets too frustrating or doesn't work right, you can always cheat with jQuery hehe
[21:14:18] <boytoy> hehe
[21:15:01] <boytoy> yeah table-cell looks good except im not sure theres a way to make each column same width: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/19/
[21:15:23] <boytoy> when you say cheat with jquery what approach did you have in mind?
[21:15:36] <boytoy> like just the outlines.. i can prolly code the thing myself :P
[21:15:43] <jphase> well I do this with height all the time on widgets of variable height to match the heighest
[21:16:14] <jphase> loop through each, set var of 0 before your loop, do a ternary like height = $(this).height() > height ? $(this).height() : height;
[21:16:30] <jphase> (with width in your case)
[21:16:37] <jphase> at the end of your .each you chain a .css('width', width);
[21:16:39] <jphase> or whatever
[21:16:50] <boytoy> cool yeah i can do that
[21:16:58] <boytoy> and then to sort them into columns?
[21:17:33] <jphase> well can you add a row element by chance?
[21:17:33] <boytoy> my existing JS is *ancient* i hope i dont have to resort to that
[21:17:40] <jphase> cause if you can, then this whole thing can be done with css
[21:17:52] <boytoy> unfortunately no i cant =/
[21:17:54] <jphase> hmm
[21:18:17] <jphase> then you're talking about something a bit more involved hehe
[21:18:23] <jphase> trying to think...
[21:18:30] <boytoy> haha
[21:18:35] <jphase> I mean, tables just fit as many elements as they can into a row, then wrap
[21:18:51] <jphase> well, is the parent variable width?
[21:18:58] <boytoy> i see i see
[21:19:00] <boytoy> yep she is
[21:19:24] <boytoy> but this is good at least now i know im not missing something obvious.. and i can dive deeper into this without the risk of looking like a fool
[21:19:28] <jphase> well you have to have some way to define how many columns go in a row
[21:19:30] <jphase> there's no way around that
[21:19:48] <jphase> whether that's a variable or whatever
[21:20:21] <dblosevn> grrr
[21:20:26] <boytoy> cool..maybe check how much space i got left on my screen or something?
[21:21:18] <jphase> sure, or just define how many columns fit in a row, depends on the application
[21:21:39] <dblosevn> jphase: http://dblosevn.chosd.com/252
[21:21:49] <dblosevn> that worked but its hacky as hell
[21:22:15] <jphase> sheesh, cache attribute didn't though huh?
[21:22:22] <dblosevn> nope
[21:22:26] <boytoy> hmm.. yeah..
[21:22:35] <jphase> well done using an old school server-side technique too btw dblosevn ;)
[21:22:43] <jphase> but yeah, not optimal
[21:22:53] <jphase> poops on the URL too a bit
[21:22:59] <jphase> lil' dingleberries hehe
[21:23:01] <boytoy> what on earth is dblosevn building?
[21:23:07] <dblosevn> I had to make both the main menu url and video page url unique
[21:23:19] <jphase> it's a jqm app in phonegap
[21:23:21] <dblosevn> wanna see the design comps?
[21:23:27] <boytoy> hell yes !!
[21:23:30] <dblosevn> they work for the most part
[21:23:36] <boytoy> :D
[21:23:49] <dblosevn> http://lxedev.com/corephonegap/index.html
[21:23:51] <jphase> dblosevn: that's at least confirming that it's cache
[21:23:58] <jphase> perhaps not on jqm?
[21:24:05] <jphase> does phonegap have any caching middlewre?
[21:24:07] <jphase> +a
[21:24:25] <dblosevn> ya but clearing it in navigator should have killed it
[21:25:10] <jphase> yeah, odd
[21:25:11] <dblosevn> this displays alright in a browser but its designed for android tablets
[21:25:31] <dblosevn> we havent added in the breakpoints for desktops yet
[21:25:40] <jphase> dblosevn: these are relative links you're having issues with too right?
[21:25:53] <dblosevn> ?
[21:26:11] <dblosevn> The last link I pasted is just the design with no phonegap backend
[21:26:25] <jphase> oh no, I just meant with your caching issue
[21:26:25] <dblosevn> just staic templates
[21:26:32] <dblosevn> oh ya
[21:26:37] <dblosevn> in android_assets
[21:26:40] <boytoy> daaamn
[21:26:41] <boytoy> CAT?
[21:26:42] <jphase> and they have hashes on them or no?
[21:26:47] <dblosevn> ya :-D
[21:26:56] <dblosevn> no hashes ever
[21:26:59] <boytoy> theres one of those outside in my parking lot :D
[21:27:19] <boytoy> this is huge man
[21:27:21] <dblosevn> video-screen.html?module=video*action=play&id=66
[21:27:34] <dblosevn> **&
[21:28:27] <dblosevn> I even built as part of my initso you can do $_GET['module'] to get the modulle :-)
[21:29:17] <jphase> dblosevn: have you read this bit yet?  "jQuery Mobile does not support query parameter passing to internal/embedded pages but there are two plugins that you can add to your project to support this feature. There is a lightweight page params plugin and a more fully featured jQuery Mobile router plugin for use with backbone.js or spine.js."
[21:30:19] <jphase> it's on the second to last bullet point on this page:   http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0-rc.1/docs/pages/page-navmodel.html
[21:30:24] <jphase> which has the links to those plugins
[21:30:28] <jphase> this sounds like it applies to you
[21:30:43] <dblosevn> I dont let jqm load my pages
[21:30:48] <jphase> ohhhh right
[21:30:50] <jphase> not dynamic
[21:31:00] <dblosevn> I stop jqm right before the request
[21:31:03] <jphase> well shit... I give up
[21:31:05] <jphase> lol
[21:31:16] <jphase> this is > my knowledge
[21:33:37] <dblosevn> boytoy: This is the web version of it did this last year http://kiosk.catkiosk.com/index.php?reset and https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/caterpillar-paving-products/id578766846?mt=8 is the itunes version working on android now
[21:34:18] <dblosevn> jphase: ya as long as it passes code review im not sweating it anymore thanks though :-)
[21:35:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> dblosevn: is that your app?
[21:36:20] <dblosevn> one thing that pisses me off is the loading image doesnt spin as the js needed to load the page seems to block the ui
[21:36:27] <jphase> !api jQeuery.extend
[21:36:27] <b-ot> jphase: No matches.
[21:36:30] <dblosevn> I built it, caterpillar owns it
[21:36:30] <jphase> !api jQeuery.extend()
[21:36:32] <b-ot> jphase: No matches.
[21:36:41] <dblosevn> spell it right
[21:36:46] <dblosevn> !api jQuery.extend
[21:36:46] <b-ot> dblosevn: jQuery.extend(): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[21:36:54] <jphase> ?
[21:36:54] <jphase> oh
[21:36:58] <jphase> haha, I mispelled
[21:36:59] <jphase> lmao
[21:37:00] <dblosevn> :-D
[21:37:18] * jphase rubs one buttock on b-ot
[21:37:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:37:38] <TTomiK> hey... is it possible to send data as an array with $.ajax? Like if I made input named item[xx], item[yy] ... ?
[21:37:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> dblosevn: so much more you can offer.....a bridge between architect team and builders
[21:38:00] <jphase> yeah TTomiK
[21:38:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> everything from building materials to orders
[21:38:13] <jphase> with POST
[21:38:14] <jphase> :D
[21:38:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> basically a contruction management tool
[21:38:18] <jphase> or GET that is
[21:38:29] <dblosevn> Rohan_Bhangui: My contract is with the Paving team
[21:38:35] <TTomiK> jphase: well, how should I construct that data? I've tried object
[21:38:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[21:38:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> jsut a though
[21:38:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> (thought
[21:38:49] <TTomiK> jphase: and I think there are no keys in javascript arrays?
[21:38:59] <jphase> there are
[21:39:11] <jphase> by default it's numeric and otherwise you can have values
[21:39:21] <dblosevn> were doing some other stuff with them too like soil density calculators, and such, I am try7ing to get in with some of the other departments too
[21:40:12] <jphase> TTomiK: http://www.quirksmode.org/js/associative.html
[21:40:13] <TTomiK> jphase: ok, I'll look into it again
[21:40:24] <jphase> object and arrays can be used synonymously with their syntax
[21:40:40] <dblosevn> jphase: which is really awesome :-)
[21:41:01] <jphase> yeah, when I found that out I stopped liking PHP a bit more and more each day
[21:41:22] <jphase> I mean you can always parse or type cast too so w/e
[21:41:35] <dblosevn> although an array doesnt act as much like an object as an object acts like an array
[21:41:45] <jphase> touchÃ©
[21:41:53] <jphase> there is no array.key
[21:41:54] <jphase> hehe
[21:42:12] <dblosevn> eg.. var test = []; test[123] = {a:1};
[21:42:32] <dblosevn> vs var test = {}; test[123] = {a:1};
[21:42:47] <dblosevn> the first would make 122 blank indexes before that
[21:42:53] <TTomiK> jphase: ok, thanks
[21:42:58] <dblosevn> the second only one index
[21:43:00] <jphase> np
[21:43:14] <dblosevn> well undefined indexes not blank
[21:43:37] <dblosevn> found that out yesterday and blew up one of my db tables lol
[21:44:46] * jphase didn't know about the undefined indexes in the first
[21:45:02] <jphase> I've never actually tried it that way cause I was told it doesn't work the other way around
[21:45:07] <jphase> interested the way it fails heh
[21:45:32] <dblosevn> at least in webkit
[21:45:44] <dblosevn> no clue what it would do in other browsers
[21:46:24] <boytoy> dblosevn: sweet
[21:46:50] <boytoy> dblosevn: btw have you considered nprogress instead of that jqmobile loading image?
[21:47:09] <dblosevn> boytoy: ?
[21:47:37] <dblosevn> I was going to use a native progress dialog but its not worth the callbacks
[21:48:12] <dblosevn> probally take more time to tell android to show and hide it then the page load takes
[21:48:13] <boytoy> ah well
[21:48:31] <boytoy> im so in love with nprogress right now though
[21:48:43] <boytoy> and its sweet lil' trickle animations, so darn cute
[21:48:48] <dblosevn> ill google in a sec
[21:48:57] <boytoy> making my users go "awwwww" as opposed to "wtf hurry up"
[21:49:07] <boytoy> heheh
[21:49:16] <dblosevn> oh then I can almost definitely not use it lol
[21:49:32] <boytoy> lulz
[21:49:33] <dblosevn> everything I do has to be approved by like 4 different departments lol
[21:49:41] <boytoy> oh wow
[21:49:48] <boytoy> thats heavy
[21:49:52] <boytoy> reminds me of government
[21:50:04] <tw2113> seriously?
[21:50:15] <tw2113> you think the government is that efficient?
[21:50:25] <boytoy> point taken :)
[21:50:26] <dblosevn> tw2113: ++
[21:51:07] <tw2113> nothing gets done until the bill looks like a ping pong ball in a Forrest Gump game, and then it gets stepped on by Lieutenant Dan's stump
[21:52:07] <boytoy> hahaha
[21:52:28] <boytoy> lieutenant dan =)
[21:54:22] <dblosevn> Anyways, its been fun just commited for the night ima head home see yall later :-)
[21:54:23] <tw2113> SIR YES SIR!
[21:54:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> cya
[21:55:52] <__machine> anyone know of a good php proxy script to bypass CORS restrictions?
[21:56:42] <jphase> __machine: I think yahoo's libraries do that actually machine
[21:56:57] <jphase> and I feel for you bro, I've had a few headaches on your specific CORS issues :[
[21:57:10] <dblosevn> __machine: this aint #php but I could write one in about 8 lines or less :-) 3 lines if I didnt use curl
[21:58:09] <jphase> I end up just allowing all access origins and call it a day if I HAVE to use jQuery, but otherwise yeah, I'd do a server side approach
[21:58:19] <jphase> what dblosevn said or some variation of it
[21:58:26] <__machine> jphase: i gave you headaches trying to solve my problems? :)
[21:58:26] <jphase> file_get_contents ftw lmao
[21:58:30] <jphase> or wget even
[21:58:49] <dblosevn> jphase: I assumed he needed to fake a referrer
[21:58:56] <dblosevn> 1 line then lol
[21:59:28] <jphase> yeah, depends on how dirty you want to get
[21:59:34] <jphase> I like using node for this >:D
[21:59:35] <dblosevn> I finally got around to enabling CORS on one of my bigger projects but I found that canvas doesnt care about cors
[21:59:40] <jphase> restify ftw
[22:00:01] <__machine> dblosevn: 3 lines for a php proxy that forwards all the headers and data in both directions transparently for GET POST OPTIONS and other methods etc?
[22:00:23] <dblosevn> 8 lines for all that
[22:00:27] <jphase> yeah
[22:00:30] <jphase> on server-side
[22:00:39] <dblosevn> he asked for php
[22:00:44] <jphase> exactly
[22:00:50] * jphase is agreeing ^
[22:00:55] <dblosevn> :-)
[22:01:13] <dblosevn> __machine: if you dont figure it out by the time I get home ill help ya out
[22:01:44] <dblosevn> jphase: http://lxedev.com/cat360/index.php?lxedev
[22:02:07] <dblosevn> I have CORS enabled and it stills throws mass errors in the logs when you rotate the 360
[22:02:13] <jphase> haha nice
[22:02:17] <jphase> like the embedded player
[22:02:24] <__machine> this cors crap is giving me a brain ache... i've reduced it to the simplest possible example and it still doesnt work in firefox AND chrome... so i assume that both have buggy implementations... or the specification doesnt allow it... i read the spec and it seems a little vague to me but everyone i speak to says it should or does work...
[22:02:44] <dblosevn> Unable to get image data from canvas because the canvas has been tainted by cross-origin data.
[22:03:13] <jphase> well I just did a whole slough of CORS stuff in SF with no problem, but I didn't need to following a bunch of redirects or anything fancy
[22:03:13] <dblosevn> Access-Control-Allow-Origin:*
[22:03:19] <jphase> yeah
[22:03:21] <dblosevn> guess canvas dont listen to CORS
[22:03:30] <jphase> I just grabbed parts with .load
[22:03:32] <dblosevn> lets me put the images in the canvas though
[22:05:12] <epicowl> hey, I have an issue where usin .data(key, value) does not work, but doing $.attr('data-key', value) does workâ¦ why would that be?
[22:05:24] <epicowl> I'm trying to set a data-attr on a dom element as a reference
[22:05:46] <rabbi1> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/#jQuery-inArray-value-array-fromIndex this will find the presence of item in array. How can i remove a item from an array if i don sent the item to compare â¦â¦
[22:06:05] <dblosevn> epicowl: .data(key, value) doesnt update attribs but the opposite is true for attrib
[22:06:33] <dblosevn> epicowl: the downside to using attrib is your vars are always strings where .data you can store objects or any other type
[22:07:15] <dblosevn> epicowl: be assured .data does work you just wont see the values in the attribs
[22:07:47] <epicowl> dblosevn: I see, but doesn't that mean that if I set something e.g. $.data(foo, bar), I should be able to retrieve it say in a click handler elsewhere with $.data(foo)?
[22:08:10] <dblosevn> $(this).data('foo')
[22:08:32] <dblosevn> in a click handler
[22:08:58] <dblosevn> aight im gone for real
[22:09:02] <dblosevn> back in 30
[22:09:03] <epicowl> ok wait does it
[22:09:15] <epicowl> matter if I use a different way to select the selector that data is bound to?
[22:09:29] <dblosevn> you mean like delgation
[22:09:30] <epicowl> e.g. $('div.someotherway elem').data
[22:09:40] <epicowl> like is it just bound to that node
[22:10:01] <dblosevn> you have to target the node you bound the data too to retrieve it
[22:10:44] <rabbi1> how to remove the item which is deselected ? http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/4/
[22:11:09] <epicowl> ah, it works
[22:11:10] <dblosevn> if the node happens to be the node that fired the click event then $(this).data('foo') would get the value where as if the dat ais in a parent div then $(this).closest('div').data('foo') would
[22:11:12] <epicowl> ok cool thanks
[22:11:25] <epicowl> you explained it for me so thank you
[22:11:30] <dblosevn> np
[22:11:58] <jphase> rabbi1: $('#alloption select option:selected').remove() ?
[22:12:28] <jphase> oh... deselected
[22:12:35] <jphase> rabbi1: $('#alloption select option:not(:selected)').remove() ?
[22:12:55] <rabbi1> jphase: i also got to remove the item from array
[22:13:10] <jphase> then .each through the selector and match
[22:13:17] <CorySimmons> Hey guys, I'm writing my first plugin and I'm having some problems. I'm not sure why this isn't setting a css top value: http://jsfiddle.net/CorySimmons/3fUWR/
[22:13:17] <rabbi1> http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/4/ this is the fiddle
[22:13:20] <jphase> then remove that from the array, and then remove $(this) as well
[22:14:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> rabbi1: sry wasnt able to hlep you yesterday or did i
[22:14:24] <CorySimmons> It should be setting a top value of about 215
[22:14:32] <CorySimmons> If you scroll a bit, I've set up some console.log help
[22:14:41] <rabbi1> Rohan_Bhangui: that's ok np
[22:14:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> :/
[22:15:03] <rabbi1> jphase: i alredy have .eachâ¦ don like to repeat the step again
[22:15:28] <jphase> then how do you plan to iterate?
[22:15:49] <jphase> if you didn't have the array, you wouldn't need to
[22:15:52] <jphase> but you have the array
[22:16:05] <rabbi1> $.each already existâ¦ but too many dependencies, that is where a lil confused ...
[22:16:35] <CorySimmons> Aha!
[22:16:42] <CorySimmons> Got it. Forgot to add .top to the end of t.offset
[22:17:06] <jphase> rabbi1: http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/byyrM/5/
[22:17:17] <jphase> delete btn removes non-selected items
[22:17:20] <jphase> is that what you meant?
[22:17:40] <rabbi1> jphase: no no, sorry
[22:17:49] * jphase is confused
[22:17:50] <rabbi1> i need to remove it from the results ...
[22:18:02] <rabbi1> not from the select element ;)
[22:18:15] <jphase> oh, just comment out the other part then, sec
[22:18:55] <jphase> so is this going to be bound to the add option button?
[22:19:11] <rabbi1> inarray will give me wether the item is in or no, similary is there a way where i compare if the item is sent is in array else remove the item from the array ...
[22:19:21] <rabbi1> jphase: yeap
[22:19:31] <jphase> yeah sure
[22:19:42] <jphase> delete obj[$(this).val()];
[22:19:46] <jphase> inside your .each
[22:19:51] <jphase> something like that anyhow
[22:19:53] <rabbi1> also, a delete buttonâ¦ but not required on that as of nowâ¦ this would be easy ,â¦.
[22:20:10] <jphase> sure, didn't understand, thought you meant dom elements
[22:20:30] <rabbi1> jphase: not dom, npâ¦ will give a try ...
[22:26:50] <rabbi1> jphase: undefined â¦ also i thought of another way, where i get a obj of all which are not selected and compare it with the existing arrayâ¦. bad way of coding ?
[22:28:03] <jphase> sure, you can try that
[22:29:33] <jphase> oh
[22:29:37] <jphase> haha, you have an array
[22:29:39] <jphase> not an object
[22:29:57] <jphase> you need to splice it
[22:30:19] <jphase> http://davidwalsh.name/remove-item-array-javascript
[22:40:18] <rabbi1> o ,ok
[22:43:49] <boytoy> jpase: Started fiddling: http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/JqZy7/22/ -- but thinking maybe I should use a plugin like https://github.com/adamwulf/Columnizer-jQuery-Plugin?
[22:45:17] <jop008> jqM 1.4 for date no widgets in FF and Safari
[22:46:28] <jphase> boytoy: yeah that's definitely the concept, but you're right, you may want to just use something like that. That is, if you specifically need to do this with that HTML (without elements representing rows or a specific count)
[22:47:41] <jphase> cause in theory you are supposed to be able to do that entirely with CSS without worrying about moldy IE versions. It can be done with the display properties and :nth-child() psuedo selectors for row declarations
[22:48:09] <jphase> but I usually just end up using tables for that, cause this is the reason tables exist :\
[22:48:46] <jphase> or just use Foundation CSS framework :P
[22:49:04] <boytoy> hehe =)
[22:49:35] <boytoy> i do not have that luxury right now, unfortunately these lists come straight outta a db
[22:50:01] <jphase> loop through <a> tags and create a table on the fly? :D
[22:50:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> hey anyone interested starting like a project
[22:50:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> for like a framework
[22:50:28] <jphase> yeah, I just made a PHP one and now I'm doing a node one
[22:50:38] * jphase loves frameworks if they're done right :D
[22:50:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> no im talking about something
[22:50:57] <jphase> front end?
[22:51:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> like a ui kit/ a framework / a time capsule sort of thing
[22:51:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> lets just call it a set of ideas
[22:51:14] <jphase> yeah, I've always wanted to make my own
[22:51:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> 8ideals
[22:51:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> *ideals
[22:51:24] <jphase> the sucky part is it takes a TON of platform testing
[22:51:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> something simple to do
[22:52:10] * Rohan_Bhangui is feeling very halo prophet like
[22:53:18] <jop008> This is my code http://pastebin.com/TzPzUCLu without the 2 JS lines I got a white input date box. With the 2 JS lines I got a black input field
[22:53:42] <jop008> So how to deal with this?
[22:53:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: forget all that i said cause know i think its just the caffiene kicking in? i wanna try and do some sort of front end framework
[22:54:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> for web apps
[22:54:28] <jphase> I just started a PHP one if you want to help contribute :D
[22:54:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> hoping to partner with someone
[22:54:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: dunno.....my php is out of date
[22:54:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> its so out of date i still use mysql_query()
[22:55:03] <jphase> I can help!
[22:55:04] <jop008> Maybe you can see my post here http://dev.jtsage.com/forums/index.php?topic=312.0
[22:55:09] <jphase> I just upgraded my out of date php :D
[22:55:13] <jphase> recently
[22:55:34] <jphase> PDO, yadda yadda, but it's still in infancy for the most part, but all dope and namespaced and such
[22:56:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: lol
[22:56:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> it would be great to start wtih learning how to use frameworks
[22:56:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> especially one like yours
[22:57:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> dunno how much ill understand
[22:57:06] <jphase> there's mainly just no other developers that I can convince to use it and I feel like it's going to waste lol
[22:57:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: thats why you do market research
[22:57:24] <jphase> I mean, not a lot of people like MVC like frameworks
[22:57:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> why?
[22:57:44] <jphase> idk, I love them
[22:58:00] <jphase> some people are just stuck in a more procedural world I think
[22:58:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[22:59:26] <jphase> idk, if you are bored and like the usage, I'll give you access to the repo: http://ezphp.org/usage/#
[23:00:21] <jphase> it's more advanced looking than it actually is, that's just mostly the core stuff, the rest is pretty cake and comes responsive with Foundation and Font Awesome out of the box
[23:00:33] <jphase> it's less-ui and more back end template loading atm
[23:00:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[23:01:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: ill tell you right off the bat i have lots fo school stuff...i will try to get to it
[23:01:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> but even then i might not understand it
[23:01:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause im not so much a backend guy
[23:01:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> lets just say im front end
[23:01:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> with knowledge of the backend
[23:01:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh and i <3 php
[23:01:54] <jphase> no need man, this is just if you want to learn MVC in PHP so it's not really everyone's cup -o- tea ;]
[23:02:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: oh wow with a quick glance there are some suefull features here
[23:02:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh wow
[23:02:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> this is relaly interesting
[23:03:01] <jphase> I was bored and pulled 3 almost all-nighters to get it done
[23:03:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[23:03:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> and this is what you do when your bored
[23:03:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> man my bored is photoshoping
[23:03:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> and posting on my dribble
[23:03:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://dribbble.com/rohanbhangui
[23:03:56] <jphase> love that stuff though
[23:04:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> whci hthe MVC stuff?
[23:04:33] <jphase> both the design part and the back end part
[23:06:26] <rabbi1> lost again :( http://jsfiddle.net/byyrM/7/
[23:06:58] <rabbi1> feel like using angular for this small stuff
[23:14:55] <jphase> hmm, anyone know how I can use a JS object to set CSS styles? It's not working how I thought it would
[23:15:25] <Cork> jphase: you mean through .css() ?
[23:15:29] <jphase> yeah
[23:15:37] <jphase> trying to pass an object in there
[23:15:42] <jphase> not working like I expected
[23:15:52] <Cork> .css({}) should work just fine
[23:16:10] <Cork> ex. .css({ 'background-color': 'red' })
[23:16:59] <jphase> hmm
[23:17:36] <jop008> Anyone using databox plugin?
[23:17:39] <jphase> saying [object Object] in my class attribute :S
[23:17:44] <jphase> oh
[23:17:49] <jphase> lmfao class attribute
[23:17:58] <jphase> ./facepalm
[23:18:13] <jphase> 23:17 <freenode> Error(421): FACEPALM Unknown command
[23:19:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: but going back: i was hoping to build a really cool front end framework
[23:19:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> that makes really powerful web apps
[23:20:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> the only notable one on based on javascirpt is meteor
[23:20:19] <jphase> well the appy part is generally a more back end thing, you mean a CSS framework?
[23:20:25] <jphase> with js and such
[23:21:13] <jphase> I'd just prefer to do it on node if that were the case, then you can have the back end app framework underneath it
[23:21:27] <jphase> with RESTful URLs for dope APIs and such! :D
[23:31:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[23:31:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> first i gotta learn how frameworks worka dnstuff
[23:31:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> they aint so simple jquery plugin
[23:31:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> jquery library
[23:32:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: also I am keeping tabs on the #botscrape channel
[23:32:19] <dblosevn> __machine: you get that CORS thing figured out yet?
[23:32:32] <__machine> dblosevn: nope
[23:32:58] <dblosevn> whats it need to return for the options request?
[23:33:00] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: you written any jQuery plugins yet?
[23:33:02] <dblosevn> * ?
[23:33:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> close too
[23:33:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> know how to write them
[23:33:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> have one or two things I wrote that i began to conver tto plugins but never finished
[23:35:30] <dblosevn> __machine: ?
[23:36:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> __machine dun goofed
[23:37:15] <__machine> sorry just got a phone call...
[23:37:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[23:38:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: .....
[23:38:42] <jphase> yo?
[23:38:43] <__machine> dblosevn: as far as i can tell, the headers that it is returning for options and get/post requests are what it needs to return... the problem is that redirects are not followed when they are returned for non-simple/safe CORS requests (e.g. preflighted requests)... the preflight/OPTIONS request is successful and then then actual request is made... and a 302 is returned...
[23:38:46] <__machine> but it is not followed
[23:39:25] <dblosevn> hmm, so the redirect is not to the same server?
[23:39:57] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: oh, was just wondering, cause once you learn strict oop jQuery node isn't that harsh to switch to
[23:40:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> true
[23:40:13] * jphase is a node nub but it sure is fun :)
[23:40:15] <__machine> dblosevn: the JS is loaded from ABC.com and makes an ajax request to XYZ.com which returns a 302 redirect to a different page on XYZ.com
[23:40:36] <dblosevn> that should be just fine
[23:40:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: ill look into fornt end frameworks
[23:40:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> most probably need your help
[23:40:58] <__machine> dblosevn: check this test case... http://test.office.3030.com.au:1704/test/
[23:41:08] <__machine> there are two submit buttons one for simple and one for preflighted CORS request
[23:41:44] <__machine> for the simple one if you watch the network tab in firefox you can see that it follows the redirect and hits the redirect target url (/test2/) but for preflighted CORS request... it gets the 302 redirect but it does not follow it
[23:42:41] <dblosevn> __machine: im not seeing the CORS headers unless the chromedebugger isnt shouing the options requests anymore
[23:42:51] <__machine> im triggering the preflight request by adding an x-requested-with header...
[23:43:14] <dblosevn> hmm, I thought xhr did that automatically
[23:43:36] <dblosevn> the browser should preflight any request thats cross orgin, will send an http OPTOINS request
[23:43:49] <dblosevn> well any get request
[23:44:01] <dblosevn> I think it works differently for post
[23:44:38] <__machine> dblosevn: it doesnt preflight "safe" requests... which are GET or POST with x-www-form-urlencoded and a couple of others
[23:45:07] <__machine> safe read only requests dont need to be preflighted
[23:46:03] <jop008> is there a separate irc on jquery mobile?
[23:46:05] <__machine> i noticed that chrome network tab and firefox network tab behave slightly differently too... both dont follow the redirect but i think firefox shows the actual 302 response but chrome hides it (but the server is definitely sending it)
[23:46:28] <dblosevn> ill reinstall firebug
[23:47:05] <dblosevn> uninstalled it the otherday to use that 3d view in the firefox debugger, to find a frustration layer in one of my templates
[23:47:33] <dblosevn> frsutrating even lol
[23:50:23] <__machine> chrome says both POST requests are "cancelled" (text status) and does not show any response in the inspector... but it does follow the redirect for simple POST but does not follow for preflighted POST... firebug shows the response headers for both POST requests and follows redirect for simple but not for preflighted...
[23:51:58] <dblosevn> __machine: in firefox i get a 302 (test/) and a 200 (test2)
[23:52:13] <dblosevn> for the bottom button
[23:52:25] <__machine> that is correct... for the simple CORS request (bottom button)... that is working as expected...
[23:52:36] <dblosevn> of course this isnt cross orgin either
[23:52:50] <__machine> but if you need to send a preflighted request, it doesnt follow the redirect...
[23:53:28] <jop008> is there a way to see the browser support the date input field?
[23:53:38] <__machine> dblosevn: it is cross origin... test.office.3030.com.au and office.3030.com.au are different domains... if you view the page on office.3030.com.au instead (no test. subdomain) then it is same origin and both buttons work...
[23:53:51] <dblosevn> __machine: ........
[23:54:00] <dblosevn> your not allowing the location header
[23:54:13] <jop008> I wnat to check on this and if not avail => normal jquery date widget (for desktop clients)
[23:54:16] <dblosevn> Access-Control-Allow-Head...	x-requested-with, content-type, accept, origin, authorization, x-csrftoken
[23:54:32] <dblosevn> of course it wont follow a redirect
[23:55:18] <__machine> i added location header... same behaviour...
[23:55:41] <dblosevn> add it for me, actually remove that header for now
[23:57:02] <__machine> you want me to remove it again?
[23:57:21] <dblosevn> remove the allow-headers header
[23:57:32] <__machine> the whole thing?
[23:57:35] <dblosevn> ya
[23:57:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: well let me start authoring some simple plugins
[23:57:49] <dblosevn> we will add it back just want to test something
[23:57:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then i will move to frameworks
[23:58:10] <__machine> ok i removed it
[23:58:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: for my own reference does rmoen always have status as away
[23:58:35] <jphase> not always, but he's pretty busy lately
[23:58:44] <jphase> I'll talk to him soon enough, no worries
[23:59:04] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: you want to finish my simple modal dialog plugin I was starting earlier?
[23:59:12] <jphase> wanted to see how easy it was to do manually :\
[23:59:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[23:59:21] <jphase> :D
[23:59:22] <dblosevn> __machine: add Acces-Control-Allow-Headers: *
[23:59:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> sure
[23:59:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> git the code for me
[23:59:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill pull a branch and take a look
[23:59:39] <dblosevn> but spell it right lol
[23:59:40] <jphase> lemme make a repo
[23:59:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> im assuming a combination of z-index
