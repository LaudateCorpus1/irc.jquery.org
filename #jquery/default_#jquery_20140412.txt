[00:26:22] <teza19> Hi, I'm developing a single-page website. I was wondering if there was a way to change the URL when a link is clicked and the page 're-anchored'
[00:27:12] <dismist> exactly, thats why i took that first class seat to the doc
[00:27:19] <dismist> i said i got yall niggas
[00:27:21] <dismist> who laughin now
[00:34:17] <Chairman> teza19 yes
[00:34:31] <teza19> how ?
[00:35:41] <Chairman> http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-hashchange-plugin/
[00:37:32] <Chairman> you set <a href="#blah"> and then $(window).hashchange( function(){ if(location.hash == '#blah') { do_some_function(); } }) $(window).hashchange(); });
[00:37:54] <Chairman> etc
[00:38:34] <teza19> yes, but the URL changes to http://url/index.php#hash1
[00:40:45] <Chairman> then just use
[00:40:50] <Chairman> window.location.hash = "blah";
[00:42:48] <Chairman> $('#ID').click(function(){ $(history.pushState({}, 'page title', '#blah')); window.location.hash = "blahpage";	} );
[00:42:51] <teza19> I need it to work in a way where if I direct a user to : http://url/hash2 it goes to http://url/#hash2
[00:44:40] <Chairman> $(history.pushState({}, 'page title', '#blah'));
[00:44:45] <Chairman> that is what you are looking for
[00:46:10] <teza19> I can see how it works for hyperlinks on a page, but not a direct connection to /hash2
[00:46:29] <Chairman> #blah is where you put the new hyperlink
[00:47:16] <Chairman> you want url/hash2 to redirect to url/#hash2
[00:47:25] <Chairman> $(history.pushState({}, 'page title', 'url/#hash2'));
[00:47:42] <teza19> Not redirect.. I want it to anchor to #hash2 without changing the URL
[00:47:49] <teza19> ok I'll try set up a JSFiddle.
[00:47:56] <Chairman> "if I direct a user to : http://url/hash2 it goes to http://url/#hash2"
[00:48:03] <Chairman> that is a redirect
[00:48:31] <teza19> What I'm trying to say is that http://url/hash2 essentially represents http://url/#hash2 ... I don't want them to see the anchors
[00:48:49] <Chairman> ok. well. I gave you the solution. up to you now.
[00:53:40] <teza19> http://jsfiddle.net/KPCVc/1/ .. Just tried testing. It doesn't work
[00:54:32] <teza19> Sorry, that's an old fiddle. The anchor in the JS part of the fiddle is correct
[00:55:03] <HiMaX> hello, How to clone <input type="text" name="setting[]"/> in a form everytime when button is clicked ?
[00:56:15] <HiMaX> or must i use it the document.createElement();
[01:09:37] <Jattenalle> teza19, set up a .htaccess with mod_rewrite
[01:14:32] <teza19> Jattenalle: I've got the push state changing the URL using: http://jsfiddle.net/tAV2k/ ... Unfortunately if I navigate to http://url/services I get a 404
[01:15:00] <Jattenalle> yeah, that's why you need mod_rewrite and .htaccess (assuming apache web server)
[01:15:32] <teza19> mod_rewrite is enabled
[01:17:18] <teza19> So, the URL gets re-written to /services [tick], but if I try to directly hit /services I get a 404
[01:17:44] <Jattenalle> yeah
[01:18:12] <teza19> Any way to fix that?
[02:56:08] <CrowX-> $(element).next() iterates through siblings, right?
[02:56:49] <CrowX-> what if an element has multiple types of siblings, by different types of classes
[02:57:02] <CrowX-> how do I choose the siblings of a certain class only?
[03:01:14] <Jattenalle> CrowX-, $(element).next('div')
[03:01:27] <Jattenalle> CrowX-, $(element).next('.myClass')
[03:03:15] <CrowX-> thanks
[03:39:16] <CrowX-> why is the $('nav-button').unbind('click')  function work in this function http://pastebin.com/hPAgV2cT but it doesn't work in this one http://pastebin.com/qZrutc5r
[03:39:47] <CrowX-> the  $(".button-nav").unbind("click"); command I meant
[03:41:46] <bel3atar> does the .click() add another listener or does it override all of them?
[03:42:27] <CrowX-> bel3atar, what do you mean?
[03:42:54] <bel3atar> CrowX-: how do I override all of the click listeners?
[03:43:08] <CrowX-> i don't know
[03:43:33] <CrowX-> I mean, I just want to have different handlers for the click event of the same button in different functions
[03:43:50] <CrowX-> it worked before with using unbind('click') in the function of the first link I posted
[03:44:04] <CrowX-> and in another function that I haven't posted
[03:44:37] <CrowX-> but when I added the third function(the second one I posted), the click handler of the previously executed function is getting executed
[04:04:00] <CrowX-> how do I override a click event handler?
[04:04:15] <CrowX-> with another click event handler on the same element
[04:05:46] <beancurd> will stop propagation work?
[04:06:01] <beancurd> event.stopPropagation();
[04:18:59] <CrowX-> beancurd, nope
[04:31:41] <beancurd> CrowX-: :(
[05:01:29] <DeafGoose> Hi all, http://pastebin.com/YhHW0vyG Why do I get the alert box twice if I make a change to the carriers element? what am I doing wrong?
[05:24:25] <t_user> DeafGoose, not exactly sure what select2 does.. I guess it's some kind of checkbox-thingie.. But you might get both "uncheck" and "check" event
[05:25:19] <teza19> How can I grab the URI of a URL? For example, I want 'services' from http://site.com/services
[05:25:54] <DeafGoose> Hi t_user, yea its a select list plugin for query...well I managed to get the multiple alerts away but for some reason when I use the change event, i wanted to clear the previous select value but it is persisting
[06:01:29] <krizoek> selectmenu("destroy") doesn't seem to work in firefox. any ideas?
[06:05:55] <Changa> Hello, I'm using jquery to shake an anchor every 5 seconds. On hover clear the interval and set it again when hovering out, it works but I'm getting "TypeError: e.handler.apply is not a function" from firebug, I have no idea whats causing this. Working page --> http://edizarca.com
[06:33:27] <aleray> hi, I have troubles with jquery ui draggable. I'm using jquery#1.11.1-beta1 and jquery-ui#1.10.4. I have a element with position fixed, and draggables inside. When I drag down, the container element scrolls, but when I release the mouse the draggable goes at the top of the container
[06:33:40] <aleray> I set scroll: true in the draggable options
[06:33:46] <aleray> but it doewn't work
[06:34:04] <aleray> have you heard of such a behaviour before?
[06:38:34] <Changa> Hello, I'm using jquery to shake an anchor every 5 seconds. On hover clear the interval and set it again when hovering out, it works but I'm getting "TypeError: e.handler.apply is not a function" from firebug, I have no idea whats causing this. Working page --> http://edizarca.com
[06:53:07] <Cork> Changa: start with loading an unminified version of jquery so you can debug what happens
[06:54:09] <Changa> Cork: TypeError: handleObj.handler.apply is not a function
[06:54:47] <Cork> Changa: agan, it helps to load a jquery version that isn't minified
[06:55:03] <Cork> then you can see what happens in jquery
[06:56:09] <Changa> yes, but its still not possible for me to understand whats going on
[06:56:58] <Changa> googling the new error
[07:06:56] <Changa> Cork: fixed it creating a function for the shake and calling it from setInterval, still don't know how it relates.
[07:07:06] <apipkin> I'm firing an event within a widget with _trigger. Is there a way to actually listen to this event within the widget? I've tried _on but it's very possible I'm missing something
[07:07:48] <Cork> Changa: setInterval(shakeIt(), 5000) isn't a valid syntax
[07:08:04] <Cork> setInterval(shakeIt, 5000) is though
[07:08:30] <Cork> Changa: the first one will take the return value from shakeIt and pass it to setInterval
[07:08:32] <apipkin> unless shakeIt is returning the function :)
[07:08:36] <Cork> it doesn't
[07:08:41] <Cork> it returns undefined
[07:10:29] <Changa> ok I see
[07:10:51] <Changa> I think its fixed since I'm getting no errors and its working as intended
[07:11:13] <Changa> getting this tho - Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated. Use defaultPrevented instead.
[07:11:27] <Cork> Changa: yes, that code is valid
[07:11:57] <Cork> Changa: expected
[07:12:13] <Changa> thanks Cork
[07:12:17] <Cork> Changa: jquery checks what the browser supports to be backwards compatible
[07:12:59] <Cork> this.isDefaultPrevented = src.defaultPrevented || src.defaultPrevented === undefined && (src.returnValue === false || src.getPreventDefault && src.getPreventDefault() )
[07:13:24] <Cork> apparently it's needed for older androids
[07:13:53] <Changa> I see
[07:15:09] <DeafGoose> Hi! Can anybody help me how I make the variable aliasesload available to the initSelection function? can't get this working http://pastebin.com/hSYwqBhu
[07:16:10] <Cork> DeafGoose: it most likely is
[07:16:21] <Cork> but you have a race situation where it isn't set when your looking for it
[07:16:36] <DeafGoose> Cork, unfortunately not, I tried and I get a undefined,
[07:16:44] <Cork> DeafGoose: move the select2 into the $.post callback
[07:16:58] <Cork> DeafGoose: ya, cause you try to access it BEFORE it is set
[07:17:29] <DeafGoose> well I did that....then I am getting some weird side effects, like every time I trigger a change event, it seems the old values are persisted
[07:18:04] <Cork> when is initSelection called?
[07:18:17] <DeafGoose> as soon as the select2 element is rendered
[07:18:28] <Cork> so on page load
[07:18:28] <DeafGoose> I am tyring to populate it with this variable
[07:18:29] <Cork> ?
[07:18:32] <DeafGoose> yea
[07:18:37] <DeafGoose> well
[07:18:37] <DeafGoose> sorry
[07:18:42] <DeafGoose> not ion page load
[07:18:56] <DeafGoose> when u trigger a change event on carriers
[07:19:32] <Cork> DeafGoose: that is when the variable is set
[07:19:36] <Cork> not when the function is called
[07:19:48] <DeafGoose> let me try moving back into the post
[07:19:54] <Cork> also you redefine the variable in the initSelection function
[07:20:04] <Cork> function(element, callback,aliasesload <--
[07:20:09] <DeafGoose> hmmm
[07:20:15] <DeafGoose> ok let me re-try this out
[07:22:03] <DeafGoose> http://pastebin.com/p9eG7L6p
[07:22:07] <DeafGoose> this is the issue Im having:
[07:23:37] <DeafGoose> if I select a item on carriers, the data gets loaded fine on the alias-list select2 element....now if I trigger a second change on the carriers select, and change some thing on the alias-list, the post happens twice
[07:23:50] <DeafGoose> should be once only
[07:24:30] <DeafGoose> seems the event is triggering twice, if I make a change again on another alias-list element, 3 times post submit
[07:25:01] <Cork> DeafGoose: ya, so select2 can only be bound once
[07:25:19] <DeafGoose> i have read the manual, I can't figure out how to fix this
[07:25:21] <Cork> you need to find a way to update it live
[07:25:43] <Cork> DeafGoose: firstly you need to figure out when initSelection is triggered
[07:26:26] <DeafGoose> week it happens as soon as slect2 is loaded
[07:26:40] <DeafGoose> this function is to prepopulate the element
[07:27:12] <Cork> so you can't use it at all for what your trying to use it as
[07:27:35] <DeafGoose> hmm
[07:27:35] <Cork> check if there is a way to have select2 to update the content
[07:28:28] <DeafGoose> hmm maybe destroy it and then re-init?
[07:33:19] <apipkin> Is it possible to have a widget listen to events fired from within itself?
[07:36:58] <Kamuela> apipkin: How is the widget structured?
[07:42:07] <apipkin> Kamuela: Within `_init` i'm calling `_bind`. `_bind` will attach to click events to LI elements on the page. Clicking on the LI will take the value of the LI (e.target.data('value')) and my thinking was to call `this._trigger('itemSelected', { src: 'ui', value: e.target.data('value')})`. But `this.on('itemSelected, fn)` is never called
[08:25:18] <earthian> Hello, I disconnected, did anybody see my message and/or replied? :)
[08:26:58] <earthian> I am trying to see what is the "event" object in function: $("x").hover(function(event){alert(event);});. Do you know what would  be the equivalent of PHP's var_dump() in jQuery or javascript in general?
[09:01:35] <repxl> how i can check if a type="file" was inserted ? i want to append next "file" types
[09:14:12] <DansVC> Hi someone can help me?
[09:16:35] <patchie> not before you ask your question...
[09:17:03] <DansVC> ok, I have a website
[09:17:23] <DansVC> that detect the move of the mouse and print them in a svg
[09:18:00] <DansVC> but it works fine in my Laptop but in my tablet happens a extra point in the polyline
[09:18:11] <DansVC> And I dont know the reason of that
[09:18:12] <DansVC> http://jsfiddle.net/YkrWL/1/
[09:18:53] <patchie> i am no jquery expert, but to eliminate, i would try different browsers to see if there is a change or constant..
[11:10:10] <DansVC> Hi
[11:10:35] <DansVC> I have a bug in my website and I have no ideia why
[11:10:45] <DansVC> this happens
[11:11:13] <DansVC> When I use my tablet happens a extra point in my svg
[11:11:17] <DansVC> http://jsfiddle.net/YkrWL/1/
[11:14:12] <i42n> Hey, I have this script: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f56007bc9515f9fa92b6 However I get this error: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function. Anyone knows why?
[11:14:51] <i42n> If I reload the page it works. If I get redirected to the page by an action - it raises the error
[11:19:48] <DansVC> i42n I cannot find the error too
[11:20:45] <i42n> DansVC: maybe after the redirect the sortable is already applied an the function does not exist any more?
[11:21:50] <DansVC> do you have jquery ui?
[11:23:06] <DansVC> i42n I guess that's because you miss the jquery ui script
[11:26:25] <i42n> DansVC: no I dont. If I do F5 to reload the page, the script works perfectly
[11:26:51] <i42n> DansVC: it just raises the error whenever I click a link and get redirected to that page
[11:29:14] <vensign> i42n check if when you do the redirection the jquery ui it's loading and that you wait for the page load before the script
[12:39:01] <otherr> Hi Jquery!  How do I check if my server is running jquery?  Or does jquery  naturally work on apache?
[12:39:51] <Kamuela> otherr: jquery is a client-side library, so it depends on a browser's support of javascript
[12:39:58] <otherr> YAYYY
[12:39:59] <otherr> thanks!
[12:40:21] <Kamuela> otherr: it'll work anywhere javascript works and the library has been downloaded
[12:40:37] <demProblemz> I get errors with a single line of jquery which destroys my whole script, I don't understand it at all
[12:40:40] <otherr> what library and downloaded where?
[12:40:44] <otherr> kameula
[12:41:02] <demProblemz> it says "object has no method replace" on $().data
[12:41:11] <Kamuela> otherr: from a static web page, you usually use something like <script src="path/to/jquery.js"></script> to load jquery onto the client's browser
[12:41:34] <otherr> thanks!
[12:42:06] <Kamuela> demProblemz: does the code have any more context than that? i could be wrong, but i don't know that an empty jquery selector call returns anything usable
[12:42:21] <demProblemz> Hang on, will paste the line
[12:42:42] <demProblemz> Here's the line http://pastebin.com/sYdzmpKc
[12:43:13] <demProblemz> id is a number and color is a string
[12:44:17] <Kamuela> demProblemz: you're trying to return the tag properties for both id and color on all instances of that class?
[12:44:52] <demProblemz> No, I'm trying to assign a color to a certain id, and store it in the data attribute of that class
[12:45:11] <demProblemz> and later on access that color in the code
[12:45:34] <Kamuela> demProblemz: is the variable color previously defined as a string?
[12:45:46] <Kamuela> demProblemz: here's what i'm looking at: http://api.jquery.com/data/
[12:45:55] <demProblemz> Yup, should be
[12:46:19] <demProblemz> oh, key must be a string?
[12:46:36] <Kamuela> demProblemz: that's what it looks like from the api reference
[12:46:50] <Kamuela> demProblemz: might be possible that a selector is never returned properly to .data
[12:46:57] <Kamuela> demProblemz: err, an element
[12:47:03] <demProblemz> I'll give it a shot with string instead
[12:47:23] <demProblemz> int + "" makes it a string, doesnt it?
[12:47:27] <Kamuela> demProblemz: with a string, so try "color" if that's the name of the data you need to replace
[12:47:58] <Kamuela> demProblemz: there's also this: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_tostring_number.asp
[12:48:07] <demProblemz> ah, thanks
[12:49:49] <demProblemz> Kamuela: works now! Thanks alot, a bit odd though... Worked fine on my primary computer
[12:50:03] <demProblemz> Worked fine with original code I mean
[12:51:24] <Kamuela> demProblemz: probably due to inconsistencies with javascript implementations. that's what i've found in the past, anyway. try to code to standard as often as you can
[12:51:53] <demProblemz> Aight, thanks again!
[12:51:54] <Kamuela> demProblemz: implicit type-casting is definitely something that some interpreters take liberties with
[12:52:17] <demProblemz> Oh how I wish they cleaned up javascript thoroughly
[13:39:19] <Jon47> eh, it's the most widely used programming language in the world, so many execution environments.. i think given the unique challenges it's pretty awesome
[13:39:35] <Jon47> i mean, pretty awesome that it's as uniform as it is
[13:39:47] <Jon47> it's dealing with problems no language has ever had to deal with before
[13:59:48] <zumba_addict> good afternoon folks, how is this done? The top picture is before clicking the 3 lined box. When it's clicked, the left nav is removed and the right pane maximizes upto the leftmost part of the browser. Do you have a sample jsfiddle? http://i.imgur.com/5ORUBnN.png
[14:03:14] <dadin> hi all somebody here?
[14:05:59] <dadin> need help with .replace, i have img in content, i replace this img with wrap(a), result is <a href="big_" class=""><img src="small_"></a> but i need one more replace for <img src="small2" how?
[14:07:43] <Jon47> dadin - img.attr('src', 'small2').wrap(a)
[14:08:01] <dadin> http://pastebin.com/0evJSWQM
[14:08:08] <monk3y> zumba_addict: http://jpanelmenu.com/ ?
[14:08:23] <dadin> here is code, i want add color box to each img in content
[14:08:32] <zumba_addict> monk3y: don't know that link but looking
[14:08:37] <dadin> but there can be 2 dimensions
[14:08:39] <monk3y> zumba_addict: either to use or learn from the unminified code
[14:08:51] <zumba_addict> ah sweet
[14:09:22] <monk3y> zumba_addict: not saying it's the best/only option, but was the "I'm feelin' lucky" link from Googling for "jquery menu panel"
[14:09:33] <zumba_addict> ok
[14:09:52] <zumba_addict> i was looking for a very simple 2 <div> codes
[14:10:15] <zumba_addict> i just wanted to see how it's done. I was thinking it could be css related
[14:10:56] <monk3y> Sure, it's all about the keywords you're looking for.  If you want to do it yourself (for learning or purity), you can still look at the core jQuery function(s) they use.  It's probably just a div toggle (changing widths) with a speed.
[14:11:22] <monk3y> Yeah CSS (3?) may do it too, haven't looked lately.
[14:11:29] <zumba_addict> got it
[14:12:18] <monk3y> zumba_addict: wow @ http://blogs.sitepointstatic.com/examples/tech/css3-sliding-menu/index.html (but not exactly what you were thinking)
[14:12:31] <zumba_addict> maybe $('.leftnav').hide() then $('.mainpanel').attr('width':100%)
[14:12:35] <monk3y> zumba_addict: but here's a CSS example: http://codepen.io/chriscoyier/pen/umEgv
[14:12:42] <zumba_addict> looking
[14:12:50] <monk3y> zumba_addict: less zumbe, more Googlin'.  Heh.
[14:12:57] <monk3y> s/zumbe/zumba/;
[14:13:01] <zumba_addict> :)
[14:13:28] <zumba_addict> wow, that's what i am really looking for. Thank you so much!
[14:13:39] <monk3y> Your example jQuery there would do it, but it would be an abrupt jump to the end-state.  Would you prefer to have it animate the slide on/off, even if quickly?
[14:13:48] <zumba_addict> i didn't know what it was called that's why i was having a hard time finding it in google
[14:14:04] <zumba_addict> i like the animated
[14:14:26] <zumba_addict> i have something to study today :D
[14:14:36] <monk3y> Yeah as I said it's all about the keywords, not a judgement.  I've Googled for minutes trying to fix something, then it's not until I see a forum conversation mentioning my problem in a slightly different way .. then the next search is like striking oil.
[14:14:56] <zumba_addict> :)
[14:15:13] <monk3y> Why can't semantic searching and AI just solve, like, everything.  #firstWorldProblems #hasTagsInIRC
[14:15:16] <zumba_addict> the solution you found for me is nice because there is no framework involve
[14:15:30] <dadin> got it, i use brain :), little trick var src = $(this).attr('src').replace('200_', '500_'); var src2 = src.replace('300_','500_');
[14:15:31] <monk3y> Yeah less dependencies/libraries the better, for some cases.
[14:16:23] <zumba_addict> yup
[14:16:45] <zumba_addict> i also can't decide if I should use bootstrap or foundation for a new project that i'm working
[14:16:57] <zumba_addict> i was told that foundation is nice but doc is not good
[14:17:14] <dadin> gn all
[14:17:17] <zumba_addict> bootstrap is nice but tricky to modify
[14:18:59] <monk3y> Depends on what parts of your project you care about customising/doing yourself, either for a particular look or function, then the rest can be re-used/defaulted from 3rd party stuff.  Just never ever write something from scratch when the end-goal is exactly what others have already done (and tested and matured and extended and evolved and has a community behind it)
[14:22:42] <zumba_addict> got it
[14:22:56] <zumba_addict> btw, I can't find the click code for that link you gave to me
[14:23:16] <zumba_addict> looks like the javascript code has been hidden
[14:25:41] <monk3y> zumba_addict: which link?  Second one/CSS example?
[14:25:54] <zumba_addict> yes, the cssPanelmenu
[14:29:44] <zumba_addict> found another simpler one :) http://jsfiddle.net/Kopokhin/v43MD/
[14:30:06] <monk3y> zumba_addict: I *think* it's just the CSS version (hence the comment in the JS pane); and they're using SCSS, a special compiled versoin of CSS that's doing magic for you.  Check out the HTML declaration of <a href="#main-nav".. then the SCSS declaration of #main-nav:target - it has redeclarations of .open-menu and .close-menu in there, so it looks like they're 'applied' (redefined?) when the
[14:30:06] <monk3y> <a> is hit.
[14:30:20] <monk3y> s/versoin/version/;
[14:30:24] <zumba_addict> got it
[14:30:42] <zumba_addict> i'll use the one i found since i'm not familiar with scss
[14:31:45] <monk3y> Gotcha.  In this instance you're losing the need for the extra JS library, but you'd need to install and learn SCSS, then add that as a deployment step (to compile it).  However; these two things (JS library and CSS compilers) do add a lot (a LOT) of cool shortcuts/productivity mechanisms.
[14:33:02] <monk3y> zumba_addict: disclaimer: I'm only 80% certain of everything I'm saying.  I'm stuck in plain-CSS and jQuery world because I'm too busy to learn more just yet, but I've read about these things and they look awesome, and "all the cool-kids are doing it".
[14:33:27] <zumba_addict> :D

[15:08:47] <tw2113> cool, spam
[15:09:34] <tw2113> Guest45430, did you come in a can?
[15:29:29] <tandroid> Hey guys, I'm trying to create a spinning wheel that aligns with a box on scroll. Kinda hard to explain but here's my example: http://jsfiddle.net/v7ESw/
[15:29:59] <tandroid> So this kind of works because the boxes are all the same height. what I'm trying to figure out is how to make it work if the boxes are different heights
[16:10:40] <jphase> tandroid: that's a pretty tricky question, but my guess would be that you'd first have to calculate the top and bottom scroll positions of each div. then you'd have to check which one you're "in" as far as the window scroll positions. from that you should be able to calculate what percentage you are in each div (you'd divide your rotation [360 degrees for example] by what percentage you're into the div in regards to scroll
[16:10:40] <jphase>  position). That would give you a rate of rotation.
[16:11:33] <tandroid> jphase, yeah so I'm actually most of the way there now I think.... I'm having trouble actually figuring out the calculation for the rotation
[16:11:47] <tandroid> http://jsfiddle.net/v7ESw/2/
[16:11:54] <jphase> it makes sense mathematically but you'd definitely have to get one thing figured out at a time. first the scroll top and scroll bottom of each box. then something that calculates what % you are scrolled into each box. then figure out what rotation % you want for each box
[16:12:09] <jphase> if you wanted 360 degrees of rotation from top to bottom of each box
[16:12:15] <jphase> then you'd need to use the numeral 360
[16:12:29] <tandroid> I actually want 60 degrees of rotation for each box
[16:12:47] <jphase> k, then you'd want to use 60 with the percentage of where you're at vertically within each box
[16:12:48] <tandroid> 360 / 6 boxes
[16:12:59] <jphase> ohhhh
[16:13:11] <tandroid> I want one full rotation total
[16:13:14] <jphase> so you want 360 degrees for the total?
[16:13:15] <jphase> oic
[16:13:47] <Moe> hello
[16:14:12] <Guest81897> i have a newly question :-)
[16:14:22] <Guest81897> can someone help me?
[16:14:52] <jphase> tandroid: well that's a bit different... you'd want to grab the scroll top of the first element, with the scroll bottom of the last element. then you'd want to grab the scroll position and divide it into 360
[16:15:15] <tw2113> just ask Guest81897
[16:15:25] <Guest81897> okay thanks
[16:15:55] <tandroid> jphase, well that's not quite what I want either. I want to move 60 degrees for each box.
[16:16:08] <tandroid> I'm trying to replicate this functionality http://viso.tv/
[16:16:20] <tandroid> Sorry, I should have shown that first
[16:16:54] <Guest81897> if I type my script in a html file, will the script run although i don't call it like window.onload ? im confused
[16:19:06] <Guest81897> I just saw an example on https://jqueryui.com/tabs/#ajax  and i don't see any function call at all
[16:19:07] <jphase> tandroid: firstly, props to you for thinking ahead since you're considering boxes of variable height - and this example is all the same height on each box. Secondly, the math would be virtually the same since the rotation itself is 360 degrees based on the entire set.
[16:19:34] <jphase> if you wanted 60 degrees for each icon, that number would change based on how many icons are in the set I'd assume
[16:20:09] <tandroid> Yes the 60 would change if there were a different number of elements
[16:20:23] <tandroid> I'm hard coding it right now but I should be using a variable for sure.
[16:20:49] <tandroid> Alright... so I'm confused on what the math would be
[16:21:59] <Guest81897> please give an answer
[16:22:04] <jphase> tandroid: okay, you should be setting 0 degrees of rotation at the top of box 1, for example, and then set (360 / number of elements) of rotation on the scroll top of box 2, etc. etc. etc.
[16:24:20] <tandroid> jphase, won't that give the same for each box?
[16:25:24] <jphase> well if you calculate the top scroll position for each box, then no
[16:25:52] <tandroid> I see
[16:25:57] <tandroid> Let me think about this for a minute
[16:26:00] <jphase> box 1 could be at position 1513, box 2's top scroll position could be at 3000, and you'd be avoiding calculating height + padding/margin
[16:26:09] <jphase> just base it on top scroll position
[16:26:14] <tandroid> Right
[16:27:36] <Guest81897> Bye my friends, I thought people can help me here :-(
[16:32:32] <jphase> Guest81897: scripts will run if you put them in a script tag on the page depending on the contents of that script tag
[16:33:28] <tandroid> NOOOO! I reloaded jsfiddle....
[16:33:30] <tandroid> shoot
[16:33:34] <tandroid> I was so close I think haha
[16:34:03] <Guest81897> alright, could you visit the page and tell me why the script runs ? Where is the call ??
[16:34:30] <Guest81897> Ive posted it at 01:19
[16:36:13] <jphase> Guest81897: the only link you posted was the ajax example on jQuery UI tabs, is that what you're referring to?
[16:36:27] <Guest81897> exactly
[16:36:48] <Guest81897> there you can visit the source as well
[16:36:51] <jphase> Guest81897: the call is in $(function() {   <---  that's a short hand for DOM ready basically
[16:37:02] <Guest81897> oh
[16:37:46] <tandroid> jphase, I'm gonna have to work on this later, but thanks for the help!
[16:37:51] <Guest81897> i know i can call a function like <input.... onkeyup=myfunc() /> for example
[16:37:59] <Guest81897> but this kind is new for me
[16:38:08] <jphase> tandroid: sure thing - that's more of a math question than a jQuery question but I appreciate the challenge ;)
[16:38:32] <tandroid> Agreed, I realized that after I asked the question!
[16:38:43] <jphase> Guest81897: get out of the habit of using inline events like that. jQuery gives you the ability to queue the events without polluting your HTML
[16:39:30] <Guest81897> I guess jQuery makes my life so easy
[16:40:17] <jphase> $('input').on('keyup', function() {     <---- use that instead ;)    and yes... jQuery makes everyone's life easier :D
[16:40:28] <jphase> brb
[16:40:49] <Guest81897> thank you for your tipp bro !
[16:45:58] <jphase> np
[16:49:15] <Guest81897> and if i want an event on one input and not for all? I mean if I have an input with an ID="input1"
[16:49:23] <Guest81897> how would I type this then?
[16:52:41] <jphase> instead of $('input') it'd be $('#input1')
[16:53:12] <Guest81897> sadly this didn't work for me
[16:53:29] <Guest81897> no autocomplete on my input
[16:53:36] <Guest81897> i tried this right now
[16:54:17] <Guest81897> $('#input').on('keyup',function ajaxCall() { ... }
[16:55:03] <jphase> do you have an input with id="input" ?
[16:55:10] <Guest81897> yes
[16:55:46] <Guest81897> but even without # didn't work
[16:56:17] <jphase> $('#input') = select an elemnt with id="input"
[16:57:04] <Guest81897> okay but why doesn't this work without a # ?
[16:57:17] <Guest81897> I have one input in my DOM at all
[16:59:19] <Guest81897> <input.... onkeyup=ajaxCall() /> worked fine
[17:03:15] <zagaza`> can someone good with javascript help me out with a fairly easy problem? how could I change this code so it reveals the items in this faded in way when all the images have finished loading, instead of pressing the reveal button? http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/kwsJb?editors=111
[17:20:00] <shoky> zagaza`: there aren't any images in there until the button is clicked
[17:20:39] <zagaza`> shoky, sry I mean if there were
[17:30:55] <sahbeewah> zagaza`, just move the click handler code outside?
[17:40:33] <zagaza`> nvm guys I got it thanks tho
[17:40:53] <zagaza`> display:none and then when images are loaded fadeIn

[17:55:47] <systemfault> Retard.
[18:25:36] <teza19> Hi, I'm trying to change the description of my page dynamically using: $('meta[name=description]').attr('content', 'new value'); .. but it just seems to remove the default description tag altogether. Why is this?
[18:27:53] <systemfault> teza19: Why would you do that, it’s insane. THe page has already been read by the crawler/spider before the JS gets executed.
[18:32:16] <Kamuela> systemfault: however true or funny, refrain from calling others names
[18:33:51] <systemfault> Kamuela: While I really do appreciate your feedback. I do what I want, thank you. I’ll call flooders retards if I feel like it. They don’t deserve to be treated like proper #jQuery citizens.
[18:34:28] <systemfault> Kamuela: That said, if you have a question I can answer, I will do so.
[18:34:59] <Kamuela> fair enough
[18:39:28] <teza19> systemfault: There's a single-page website that's in development and I want to change the description per link
[18:40:29] <teza19> Happy to hear other suggestions.
[18:41:09] <systemfault> teza19: <meta>information are for crawlers, that’s what I mean. It’s unused by the user. That information needs to be filled by the server to work.(Might change in the future)
[18:41:29] <systemfault> Unless I totally misunderstand the requirement
[18:42:24] <teza19> systemfault: I read somewhere that crawlers are adapting / have adapted to the JS features
[18:42:39] <teza19> I need a description per section - isn't that how it should /always/ work?
[18:42:41] <systemfault> teza19: Then try it, it would be something like: $('meta[name="description"]').attr('content', 'lol');
[18:43:15] <systemfault> teza19: But then… what is the “default description” you were talking about earlier?
[18:43:16] <teza19> is there any way to validate it?
[18:43:41] <systemfault> validate? Just reselect the node, you’ll see that the text has changed.
[18:44:05] <teza19> That's the thing. I can't.. it just 'disappears' from the source code
[18:44:26] <systemfault> teza19: What source? When you’re doing “view source”?
[18:44:26] <teza19> either that, or it doesn't change.
[18:44:33] <teza19> Yah
[18:44:58] <systemfault> It won’t change, there’s something fundamental you don’t understand about a web browser and html.
[18:45:40] <teza19> Ok, fair enough. But I just need to know how to validate it
[18:45:41] <systemfault> HTML is a human-readable serialized DOM, the browser reads it, builds a tree datastructure internally and ditches the HTML as it doesn’t need it anymore.
[18:46:07] <systemfault> Any modification you’re doing with JS is going to affect the DOM tree, not the HTML.
[18:46:21] <teza19> Ok, that makes sense
[18:46:31] <systemfault> HTML is to DOM what JSON is to a JS object, if you want.
[18:47:19] <systemfault> So, there’s no “validation”.. you set the meta description node to have the content you want… then if you want to validate, just “reselect” it using jQuery, you’ll see a different text.
[18:47:32] <systemfault> You will see it changed in your “dev tools”
[18:47:36] <systemfault> Not in view source.
[18:47:46] <systemfault> What browser do you use?
[18:53:27] <yaymukund> how do I find out which "event delegation shims" jquery provides?
[18:53:57] <yaymukund> From: http://emberjs.com/guides/understanding-ember/the-view-layer/#toc_adding-new-events (see the very bottom of the "Adding new events" section.
[18:59:07] <systemfault> What do you mean by shim in this case? Like supporting events that don’t bubble on some browsers when they should?
[19:00:44] <yaymukund> systemfault: I think so.
[19:01:35] <yaymukund> hmm, sorry, I realize my question is not very well formed
[19:02:40] <systemfault> The only event that bit me in the past is the “change” event not bubbling on older IE versions.. and IIRC, jQuery shims it.
[19:03:17] <yaymukund> I think I can just test for all the events I care about.
[19:03:25] <systemfault> Beside that… you just need to remember that “focusin” is the bubbling version of “focus” and “focusout” the bubbling version of “blur"
[19:03:56] <yaymukund> oo, haven't run into that. interesting.
[19:04:10] <yaymukund> I'm looking for timeupdate and loadedmetadata events, and anything else on audio. I think they are all non-bubbling and non-shimmed.
[19:04:44] <systemfault> yaymukund: You’re probably right… I don’t think jQuery supports anything that is like “pure html5 dom stuff"
[19:06:21] <yaymukund> cool, thank you for answering, systemfault !
[19:34:07] <deitarion> What's the best way to select the first A tag within each 'div.user-wishlist .view-content'?
[19:35:13] <deitarion> Or, actually, I might as well ask about the nth to generalize the knowledge for future use.
[19:42:18] <rb6> I need to modify this css file in some places to create a mobile view for each existing view, i'm just wondering if there is an easy way to do this across all the views, here is the css file and an example of a view:  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/dcf0d933df1f4ce74f7b
[19:48:25] <rb6> or, could i get the source code or the otherwise source of the css from the original developer of this css and recreate it from there with the new mobile settings?
[20:08:45] <otherr> Hello I have a question!  Okay I am sending some data to a php file using Ajax.  Do you have any idea for the success function that could take the result from that php file and feed it into another javascript?
[20:11:30] <rb6> another javascript function running on the client side?
[20:11:54] <otherr> yea
[20:12:38] <rb6> the correct way to do that would be to save the data on the server side in some way and have it accessible to the other function running on the client
[20:13:12] <ph1> hi guys I have 2 modals I firing up on click, one has straight text, the other is using ajax to pull in a login form. On my desktop both modals work just fine, and I can login without issue. On my android test device only the text modal displays anything. The ajax modal displays only the popup and x to close the window. The only difference in the code is the ajax one is using jquery.load. I've tested this with 5 different versions of jquery from 1.6 up to 1.11 an
[20:13:12] <ph1> d same result on all of them. I've also loaded jquery-migrate-1.2.1 uncompressed to see if it was from deprecated code but nothing shows.
[20:14:07] <otherr> Right now I have the data saved in a mysql database.  So Im gonna send an id then get the data I need and have the result of the php script come back to the function.  Is that doable?  It seems to be so.  I just cant find out exactly how to.
[20:14:08] <ph1> are there any gotcha's using ajax modals on android?
[20:15:28] <rb6> one running script saves something to the database, another running script acesses the database, yeah it can be done
[20:15:57] <ph1> also I tested in chrome, firefox and ie on Android IE is worst as in it doesn't even show the modals.
[20:16:02] <rb6> or even saves it in a session variable
[20:17:33] <otherr> rb6 : I dont know how session variables work.  Im basically gonna get the url id then push it to php script to get mysql data.  Then Im gonna take the result from php script and somehow feed it into a javascript function
[20:18:42] <rb6> maybe you could do some sort of cross-call on the client side, it would be hack, but some kindof javascript call to modify some object in the client, then it triggers another javascript function to acess the server and get data, anyways i'm not really sure exactly what your environment is but i'm sure something can be worked out
[20:19:40] <otherr> rb6 : Hmm.  I dont understand that.  Im going to try jsonEncode I just found.
[20:19:50] <deitarion> otherr: What about having PHP return JSON and having jQuery parse it? Is that not sufficient?
[20:19:50] <rb6> ok
[20:20:04] <deitarion> Heh. Timing.
[20:20:11] <otherr> deitarion : exactly what I just found!  So how do I parse it into javascript?
[20:20:40] <deitarion> otherr: If you're using jQuery's AJAX functions, just tell it to expect JSON and it'll do it for you.
[20:21:02] <deitarion> Just make sure you return valid JSON for error conditions as well as success if you go that route.
[20:22:02] <otherr> deitarion : Okay I dont know how to tell it what to expect.  I am going to try something
[20:22:15] <deitarion> What function are you using?
[20:22:20] <deitarion> (for your AJAX)
[22:31:51] <duch_kazatel> woah.  was there a netsplit?
[22:35:20] <jphase> yeah, a big one
[22:35:28] * jphase attempts to not say that's what she said
[22:36:36] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[22:37:06] <duch_kazatel> late night #jquery is the best sometimes.
[22:47:23] <duch_kazatel> this project is slowly killing my soul
[22:52:18] <aroman> hey, can someone help me with a javascript-powered animation? I want an input to slide down, but I don't want it to distort. I want to slide it along the y-axis, basically. Here's a jsfiddle to show what I mean: http://jsfiddle.net/aroman/AfM9M/2/
[22:53:05] <duch_kazatel> so what's broken in this example?  you want that input to "slide down", but really as more of a "reveal"?
[22:54:13] <aroman> i guess so. actually I think if I wrap the input in a div i get closer to the effect that I want. http://jsfiddle.net/aroman/AfM9M/3/
[22:54:32] <aroman> now my issue is there's that jerk at the end of the animation
[22:54:46] <duch_kazatel> which browser?
[22:54:56] <aroman> chrome
[22:55:27] <aroman> let me see if firefox behaves any differently
[22:55:44] <duch_kazatel> it does :)
[22:55:59] <aroman> oh wtf
[22:56:05] <aroman> firefox does that perfectly
[22:56:08] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[22:56:24] <aroman> so uh, what can I do to support the webkit-based masses?
[22:57:48] <duch_kazatel> something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/AfM9M/4/
[22:57:53] <duch_kazatel> not perfect, but you get the idea.
[22:58:06] <duch_kazatel> the issue is a disagreement about there elements stop/start
[23:00:08] <nexIRC> I'm trying to put the nivo slider on my site, do you know why it looks all jacked up? http://team-nexgen.org/
[23:02:41] <aroman> duch_kazatel: hey that works perfectly for me
[23:03:05] <aroman> i'll probably play with the easing function, but that totally eliminates the jerk
[23:03:16] <aroman> i don't quite understand why it works though
[23:03:23] <duch_kazatel> aroman look at the CSS
[23:03:31] <aroman> right
[23:03:58] <aroman> why should setting the bottom margin to 0 fix the bug?
[23:04:38] <duch_kazatel> default padding and margins on inputs combined with browser layout funk.
[23:04:53] <guideX> nevermind, figured it out :))
[23:07:04] <aroman> ah i see
