[00:18:17] <kkiwi08> hi, i am new here can anyone help me on how to contribute
[00:23:56] <ShadeS> hey guys
[00:24:36] <ShadeS> if I do something like $('div').on('click', function() { alert('user clicked on the div') }); how can I actually pull the information within that div out?
[00:25:57] <arc_> ShadeS i assume you are referring to the inner html
[00:26:08] <ShadeS> that might be so
[00:26:28] <arc_> then it's just text() or html() depending on what you need
[00:26:44] <ShadeS> $('div').on('click' function () { $(this).text() } ) ??
[00:26:54] <arc_> sure
[00:27:05] <arc_> but you're missing a semicolon
[00:27:10] <ShadeS> cause doing that straight up into chrome tools doesn't really give me the data i want
[00:27:19] <arc_> well, you're selecting all divs in the document
[00:27:23] <ShadeS> so it looks like i gotta somehow store it into a variable and console.log it to see if i'm actually doing it
[00:27:29] <ShadeS> arc_: yeah I don't want that
[00:27:35] <ShadeS> I just want the <div> that the user clicked on
[00:28:02] <arc_> yes, but like ... events bubble up, so
[00:28:46] <ShadeS> so i'm confused
[00:28:52] <ShadeS> idk how to pull a specific div out
[00:28:57] <ShadeS> the one the user clicked on
[00:30:29] <arc_> ShadeS the thing is that the div is contained in another div
[00:30:42] <arc_> so when the event bubbles up it's firing for each parent div
[00:30:51] <arc_> what you need is stopPropagation()
[00:31:08] <arc_> or to select the div you are binding to more specifically
[00:31:27] <ShadeS> the divs don't have a class or id
[00:32:09] <arc_> okay, so you need to add the event parameter to your function call - function(event)
[00:32:16] <arc_> and then add event.stopPropagation();
[00:32:32] <arc_> after your $(this).text();
[00:34:55] <ShadeS> weird: Uncaught TypeError: event.stopPropogation is not a function
[00:35:03] <arc_> you spelled it wrong
[00:35:30] <ShadeS> oh
[00:35:48] <ShadeS> yeah well the alert $(this).text() seemed to work even if I didn't do the stopPropagation
[00:35:59] <arc_> yes it works, but it returns more than you want it to
[00:36:19] <arc_> stopPropagation() prevents the event from bubbling up
[00:36:25] <ShadeS> no, it actually just altered the text of the one i clicked on
[00:36:32] <ShadeS> which was the first one so maybe that's why
[00:36:35] <arc_> what?
[00:36:50] <ShadeS> eitherway when propagation is spelled correctly it still works
[00:37:41] <arc_> well if it works that's fine. without seeing what you're actually doing, i can't really judge whether there is any potential problem
[00:38:10] <ShadeS> i have a loop that generates random 'tweets' when a user clicks on a user's name it's supposed to bring up their timeline
[00:38:43] <ShadeS> i need to first find out which div they clicked on, and then pull out the text of that, except most of that text is useless I need to just get the users name, whic I will have to probably store in a string, then figure out how to splice out the contents betwen @ and :
[01:08:23] <Mark____> does anyone know how to blur the background video using either css or jquery plugin?
[01:10:11] <arc_> seems like css blur should do the trick ..
[01:10:30] <Mark____> but i just want to blur the background video of the targeted div not the whole video background
[01:10:35] <Mark____> it’s a tough one.
[01:10:57] <arc_> like an overlay?
[01:11:11] <Mark____> see how it blurs text, but not the video http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/index.php?mid=today
[01:11:14] <Mark____> yeah.
[01:11:24] <arc_> i think that's what this is doing http://codepen.io/magnus16/pen/emNbav
[01:11:25] <Mark____> i want to give it a nice gaussian blur effect like photoshop does
[01:12:09] <Mark____> hmm..
[01:12:28] <arc_> it's just duplicating the video and displaying the blurred version inside the div
[01:12:32] <Mark____> yeah
[01:12:47] <Mark____> but i guess that’s a way.
[01:34:25] <ShadeS> https://api.jquery.com/empty/ confused about something
[01:35:19] <ShadeS> if we were to $('.container').empty() then the divs with classes hello and goodbye would also disappear?
[01:37:34] <arc_> yes

[02:36:42] <hellyeah> const func1 = function() {...} const func2 = function() {...} const func3 = function(){..} $(function(){ func1(); func2(); func3(); }) do you think this style is good for clean code?
[02:47:58] <rcyr> I guess.
[02:48:22] <hellyeah> rcyr: is it to me?
[02:48:27] <rcyr> Ya
[02:48:48] <hellyeah> ah okey :D
[02:49:35] <hellyeah> rcyr: can i ask js question to you?
[02:50:04] <rcyr> Yes.
[02:50:21] <hellyeah> i want to use js template
[02:50:48] <hellyeah> do you think this way is good https://jsfiddle.net/w8e04uct/21/ or do i need to create template element in js?
[02:51:28] <rcyr> Yeah, works fine for simple cases
[02:51:46] <hellyeah> both works?
[02:51:52] <hellyeah> what do you mean simple cases?
[02:54:35] <rcyr> hellyeah: When you don't need partials or template inheritance
[02:56:01] <hellyeah> hmm i guess i must be more advanced in that point
[02:56:39] <hellyeah> rcyr: this is my sense about js template. js template can be used for the element that exist
[02:56:39] <hellyeah> on the page with no doubt and can be eate more then once.
[02:59:28] <rcyr> hellyeah: ES6 will make that much simpler.
[03:00:41] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:01:10] <hellyeah> i dont know about ES6 way there is any source you can suggest me for reading?
[03:04:14] <rcyr> hellyeah: ES6 template strings.
[03:06:24] <hellyeah> i will check that
[03:06:47] <hellyeah> btw i know this is simple question but why it didnt work https://jsfiddle.net/0rqdvgey/?
[03:10:35] <hellyeah> rcyr: i am sorry
[03:52:34] <clearcut> i have $http post request, after it is finished i want to fire another http request inside ".then" - is this valid way to chain htto post request?
[03:52:43] <clearcut> sorry wrong channel
[03:53:33] <Mark____> is there a way i can load articles one by one with a nice fade in effect? right now all contents load at the same time.
[03:57:32] <crooksey> Is there anyway on ios9 to get the keyboard to auto popup on a html page that has the autofocus attribute? I can see lots of stuff online for > ios8, but nothing about 9. I am sure there must be a solution, but I can't seem to find one anywhere.

[05:47:45] <Raging_Hog> I'm getting application/json which ajax().success()  is parsing automatically. But how should I check that is giving me valid JSON?
[05:47:58] <Raging_Hog> the server might output 200 OK and a weird error string
[05:53:38] <shoky> Raging_Hog if the response has application/json content-type but the body is not valid json, you'll get the error callback triggered
[05:54:09] <shoky> assuming you haven't set `dataType` option
[06:08:34] <Raging_Hog> shoky: thanks. I had a fail-function there but the problem was the time when the content type wasn't set on server side
[06:08:58] <DFar> Hi all
[06:09:53] <DFar> someone had any problems with a listview menu ?
[06:15:55] <DFar> Is someone available ?
[06:17:54] <delboy1978uk> hi guys, i need to check whether a select dropdown contains an option with a value matching my cvariable, amny idea how i should be doing that?
[06:25:44] <Duikb00t> Are there Owl Slider users here?
[06:25:50] <Duikb00t> Can I reduce the speed of the slides?
[06:26:03] <Duikb00t> And then I really mean the animation of them not the wait time before a new slide.
[06:30:13] <Mark____> could anyone tell me how to select dynamically added elements on this page? http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[06:48:09] <Uhkis> delboy1978uk: loop through it's options
[06:53:35] <delboy1978uk> Uhkis: cheers, I’m already ahead of that, but thanks all the same!
[06:53:48] <delboy1978uk> i just used $(select).find('option:contains('+val+')');
[07:03:27] <Duikb00t> What is a good way when you have a horzontal navbar on to
[07:03:52] <Duikb00t> top* of your page when you start scrolling and the menu goes out of view... you generate an other fixed menu which layout is different from the default one?
[07:10:28] <Uhkis> Duikb00t: sticky menu plugin should generate a lot of hits on google
[07:12:51] <Duikb00t> Uhkis: http://stickyjs.com/
[07:31:08] <Duikb00t> Ok great thanks! works like a charm now I only want this to be shown when the viewport is over the 850 pixels.
[07:31:23] <Duikb00t> Should I just add a resize handler and make sure the width is larger then 850  pixels and then add the logic for that men?
[07:31:25] <Duikb00t> menu*
[07:35:51] <skanna> android is scrolling this and aint show the overlay but ios is showing it while scrolling.. http://www.hastebin.com/ileyagovel.coffee any idears?
[07:35:59] <hellyeah> re factoring the code is pain in the neck
[07:41:47] <Duikb00t> What's the best way to init the current window with etc? My Resize handler works but I first have to resize before it does what I already shoul ddo ><

[08:36:05] <sigdk> shoky, there ? yesterday I asked something about the behavior of validate plugin and you suggested check some of its properties. I still cannot get to do what I want. The validate seems to be executed whenever I change the focus of a field. I'd like to be executed only on submit: https://jsfiddle.net/L75q0452/17/
[08:38:49] <shoky> sigdk: i told you exactly what options and what to set them to...
[08:39:20] <sigdk> no
[08:39:41] <shoky> no?
[08:39:42] <shoky> [15:29:46] <shoky> sigdk: you can set onclick,onkeyup,onfocusout options to false
[08:41:08] <hellyeah> hmm why i got this erro i dont kjnow
[08:41:14] <sweet2k4> i have a question. I want to store some text in a file localy from and html document. is this possible with javascript?
[08:41:19] <sweet2k4> an*
[08:41:27] <sigdk> sorry, I remembered you telling me check these properties. I tried them one by one (not all three together) and it didn't seem to work
[08:41:33] <sigdk> shoky, sorry
[08:41:47] <shoky> what i pasted is the only thing i told you :)
[08:41:53] <hellyeah> i know
[08:41:54] <hellyeah> damn
[08:43:03] <sigdk> shoky, I have 2 more questions... if I may...
[08:43:14] <sweet2k4> #web
[08:43:36] <shoky> sigdk i don't have time now but ask in the channel, i'll get to it later or someone else will
[08:43:50] <sigdk> OK
[08:44:33] <sigdk> Is this validate plugin common ? http://jqueryvalidation.org/  Can someone do without it only with bootstrap ?
[08:44:53] <taplar> afaik, pretty common
[08:45:33] <sigdk> taplar, can't someone do validation with bootstrap ?
[08:45:52] <taplar> i'm not that familiar.  do they have a validate plugin?
[08:46:50] <slax0r> why complicate, your serverside must validate input again anyway...
[08:47:07] <taplar> user experience
[08:48:19] <slax0r> and yes, bootstrap does have some validator libs
[08:48:26] <slax0r> if they're 3rd party, don't know
[08:50:17] <DFar> No idea about my listview menu ?
[08:51:18] <taplar> unfortunately i don't have an iphone to see the issue
[08:52:32] <DFar> i have not too(but my boss), but, the issue seem to be reproduce with google chrome and the device manager
[08:52:42] <taplar> "when i go back exclusively on Iphone , the page be blank"
[08:52:45] <taplar> how are you going back?
[08:53:42] <DFar> on keyboard, with the backspace
[08:53:57] <taplar> k
[08:53:59] <DFar> on iphone  with  [<  ]
[08:54:09] <taplar> so the browser back button, not an app navigation
[08:56:28] <taplar> yeah, not seeing it on my laptop in mobile view mode in ff or chrome. :(
[08:56:51] <DFar> wait a sec, i disable the setinterval
[08:59:04] <DFar> so when i press the menu button, it work, when i go through the menu again, it work, but, when i press Backspace, ... the page gone to be blank
[09:00:04] <DFar> i've add a little fix on the tap event ,and the activePage be '.ui-page-active'
[09:00:48] <DFar> but what i can't understand is why on android it work, on ipad it work, but nor on iphone ?
[09:01:32] <sigdk> and any idea on how to get rid of all the error pop-ups whenever I click on a field ? https://jsfiddle.net/L75q0452/18/  focusCleanup "doesn
[09:01:41] <sigdk> * doesn't seem to work
[09:01:58] <sigdk> (in the way I expected...)
[09:02:41] <DFar> taplar : on chrome have you changed the device (iphone * devices )?
[09:03:33] <javlens> is there a better alternative to zoommap for creating interactive maps? the zoommap I'm looking at on one site appears to load up a js file for each location with extra css and image files, and it looks like it's taking the longest of all elements on a page to load
[09:03:50] <taplar> i did the toggle device mode (Ctrl + Shift + M)
[09:04:43] <DFar> i can't reproduce it on firefox, but on chrome yes
[09:05:05] <DFar> Chrome, F12, devices [Apple Iphone 6]
[09:09:27] <taplar> sigdk: a S.O. post i found says the method to clear the form error messages doesn't work with bootstrap 3, which it looks like your using in the fiddle
[09:14:28] <crooksey> I am trying to force a focus, after a page has loaded onto an element. I can force this on load, but how can I add a timer as such, so it focuses say 4 seconds after the page load http://paste.ofcode.org/EDTULtgXwdfHBCds3ETPt5
[09:16:39] <sweet2k4> is there anyway to bypass the blocking of writing to files localy with js
[09:23:12] <DFar> Someone can reproduce my 'bug' ?
[09:23:40] <hellyeah> hey
[09:23:58] <hellyeah> .closest('body') make sense or is there a way to go up to body straight?
[09:26:37] <decx> there's only one body makes no sense to use traverse methods
[09:27:22] <hellyeah> line 154 how can i make this better http://jsfiddle.net/1ndnqchu/37/
[09:27:53] <decx> no idea i stop reading fiddles after 20 lines
[09:28:27] <hellyeah> it was enough to look line 154 let me do it small fiddle
[09:28:40] <decx> ids are supposed to be unique
[09:28:47] <decx> makes no sense to go up to body and then find and id
[09:28:50] <decx> just get the id
[09:30:47] <hellyeah> decx: https://jsfiddle.net/5cxux6jv/
[09:38:45] <hellyeah> it doesnt make sense_
[09:38:46] <hellyeah> hm
[09:47:00] <TECFALL> If i have an object as such: Object {validate_date: "12/01/2015"} how could i push this {tn: "on", tw: "on"} into that object?

[10:07:36] <hellyeah> it worked
[10:08:12] <lukakiro> e-anima: No, sorry, this isn't the right way
[10:12:59] <hellyeah> hey
[10:13:02] <hellyeah> hmm
[10:14:52] <e-anima> lukakiro ok. i did it another way that works
[10:17:07] <_noobie_> I have a flash player item that the full screen no longer works on a linux build of Firefox.  Is there a way that I can trigger it with a keypress?
[10:21:57] <javlens> what's a good, _fast_ interactive mapping library?
[10:28:35] <DFar> Any idea for the bug  in my listview menu ?
[10:33:10] <taplar_busy> mmm, pizza for lunch...
[10:53:13] <graphettion> taplar: Hoping to get my point across today. I think it's sinking in.
[10:53:42] <taplar> to your other peeps?
[10:53:43] <graphettion> taplar: My idea is to organize everything via search and if they want categories then it will be on the left.
[10:53:47] <graphettion> yeah
[10:53:50] <graphettion> the devs
[10:53:51] <taplar> cool
[11:00:25] <techouse> I wrote a function that I bind on some DOM element, but what if I want to bind it to something that I dynamically append?
[11:00:31] <techouse> sort of like
[11:01:02] <techouse> $('#myDiv').append(nodeElement).myFunction(parameter);
[11:01:23] <taplar> hold on, what do you mean bind?
[11:01:34] <taplar> using on() or are you actually putting it on the elements?
[11:01:54] <techouse> not using on, since the myFunction already handles clicking
[11:02:18] <taplar> if your trying to extend jQuery you'd attach your method to either $ or $.fn
[11:02:34] <techouse> yea i made a $.fn.
[11:02:52] <taplar> k, so it would be available for all jquery objects
[11:02:55] <techouse> $.fn.myFunction() = {...}
[11:02:59] <techouse> yes
[11:03:03] <taplar> yup
[11:03:24] <Felishia> why can't I traverse a virtual element?
[11:03:37] <taplar> you can. what are you trying exactly
[11:03:45] <techouse> but now how to execute that with nodeElement which I create like nodeElement = document.createElement('button') etc.
[11:03:47] <taplar> and what are you calling 'virtual'
[11:04:05] <taplar> $(nodeElement).thefunction()
[11:04:16] <techouse> umm, ok
[11:04:23] <techouse> and that will work?!
[11:04:28] <taplar> y not?
[11:04:38] <techouse> dunno, seams kinda wild :D
[11:04:46] <taplar> a jquery object is just an object containing a result set of dom elements
[11:04:52] <techouse> so i do that before appending it to the DOM?
[11:04:58] <taplar> doesn't matter
[11:05:14] <taplar> you just need to get that element in a result set
[11:05:20] <techouse> oky... let's see that :D
[11:08:10] <techouse> omg it works :D
[11:08:17] <taplar> :)
[11:08:24] <techouse> i didn't know one could pull stunts like these
[11:08:28] <taplar> sure
[11:08:30] <techouse> oky :D makes sense but :D
[11:14:44] <Ty_> Is there a way to tell if your function is breaking due to your jQuery being minified?
[11:15:22] <taplar> does it work unminified?
[11:15:38] <Ty_> I believe so, I can't tell since the framework auto-minfies it
[11:15:45] <DFar> Other question, my activePage height is not the real height expected of the document, can i fix it easily ?
[11:16:02] <Ty_> Here is the page where it is minified: https://preview.hs-sites.com/_hcms/preview/template/multi?template_layout_id=3792192176&is_buffered_template_layout=true&portalId=494351&tc_deviceCategory=DESKTOP#target-3
[11:16:28] <Ty_> Here is a crude mocked up jsfiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/gjyswrr9/22/
[11:17:09] <Ty_> Basically what is happening is if you scroll through the slide with arrow keys, then use the time line below, it will click to go to that slide, but it goes to the slide before the one you clicked, if that makes sense
[11:19:14] <taplar> hmm
[11:20:05] <taplar> the fiddle seems to work, no?
[11:20:39] <taplar> i'm assuming that based on the text in the top left corner of the images
[11:20:51] <Ty_> Yes, the fiddle works correctly
[11:21:02] <Ty_> here is my S/o question that explains it: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34954123/having-trouble-implementing-jump-to-slide-in-a-jquery-slider
[11:21:18] <Ty_> The fiddle is from user Aer0
[11:23:39] <taplar> personally it seems like you'd want to do something like a data element on your slides instead of keeping a variable telling you which one is currently displayed
[11:25:54] <Ty_> I don't believe I can use data-elements due to the frame work. The slides are modules and I can only update 1. class name 2. id name 3. outer-wrapping divs
[11:26:19] <taplar> if you had to, you could do them in the script
[11:27:06] <taplar> $('.tour-panel').each(function(element, index){ $(element).data('imageOffset', index); });
[11:27:33] <Ty_> Well, if you have the time to help, toss an answer on S/o :) 200 bounty haha I'd really appreciate the help
[11:27:53] <taplar> then previous and next becomes evaluating the imageOffset of the displayed image
[11:28:38] <Ty_> Does it matter if they are <divs> and not <image?
[11:28:44] <Ty_> <image> *
[11:28:51] <taplar> nope
[11:28:58] <taplar> data elements can be on pretty much anything
[11:29:19] <taplar> data-* is just a way to define non-standard attributes on tags
[11:29:37] <Ty_> Ah i gotcha
[11:30:00] <Ty_> so do I want to call the above code in the prev/next function? or outside of a function?
[11:30:23] <taplar> that would be done some where at the start of your doc ready
[11:30:38] <taplar> it's just setup since you said you can't change your markup otherwise
[11:31:52] <Ty_> Okay, so I have my doc ready, that function, then call my var current
[11:32:20] <Ty_> What should I see happening? Right now I console log the slide number when clicking through with side tabs/arrow keys, but not with the clicking on the timeline
[11:34:14] <taplar> currently how does your timeline identify which image it needs to show?
[11:34:58] <Ty_> I will pastebin the code, one sec
[11:35:25] <taplar> i mean, surely it doesn't use the current var
[11:35:37] <taplar> so there's some other relation like they know about an id or something?
[11:35:52] <Ty_> http://pastebin.com/9zqNczGf
[11:36:19] <Ty_> Yes,t hey are calling the pages by ids using this var: var target_id = $(this).attr('href');
[11:36:31] <taplar> hmm
[11:37:22] <delboy1978uk> what does a comma mean in a statement like this? var select = $('select', conf._input);
[11:37:24] <taplar> i don't think you need to do all that logic
[11:37:40] <taplar> delboy1978uk: the second argument is the context to search in iirc
[11:38:10] <taplar> Ty_: your link href is already matching the selector you'd need to do to find the div, so you should just be able to stick that in $()
[11:38:20] <taplar> not any of that split by - stuff your doing
[11:38:33] <taplar> that's your issue
[11:38:34] <taplar> hah
[11:38:53] <taplar> $($(".tour-panel")[current]).addClass("active-tour fadeInRight");
[11:39:13] <Ty_> So remove split by?
[11:39:34] <taplar> lets explain the issue first, before refactoring
[11:39:44] <Ty_> Perfect, I'm all ears... er eyes
[11:39:52] <taplar> so your getting a # from your links to know which image to go to
[11:40:04] <Ty_> yes, that's correct
[11:40:07] <taplar> and your first image is #target-1
[11:40:11] <taplar> so the number is 1
[11:40:19] <taplar> but arrays are 0 based
[11:40:25] <Ty_> Well, I believe I got #target, #target-1, etc
[11:40:39] <Ty_> #target being '#target 0'
[11:40:46] <taplar> in the fiddle your first one is target-1
[11:41:26] <Ty_> The fiddle was a crude rip, since the real one uses a framework for a lot of it
[11:41:43] <Ty_> if you go to the real link: https://preview.hs-sites.com/_hcms/preview/template/multi?template_layout_id=3792192176&is_buffered_template_layout=true&portalId=494351&tc_deviceCategory=DESKTOP#target-3
[11:42:19] <Ty_> tabbing to the right, will bring you to a target page with a graph icon (this is #target) then the next slides begin counting #target-1, #target-2. etc
[11:44:55] <taplar> run this guy in your console: $(".tour-panel")
[11:45:09] <taplar> #target-1 is is in offset '2'
[11:46:41] <Ty_> Where do you see it list the offset?
[11:46:52] <Ty_> or are you just judging by it being the 3rd item in the list?
[11:46:59] <taplar> it's the #: before the element
[11:47:12] <taplar> what browsers are you in?
[11:47:42] <Ty_> Google chrome
[11:47:42] <taplar> you can also click the far left Object and it should pull up the structure in the rhs
[11:48:25] <Ty_> <div id="target" class="span12 widget-span widget-type-cell animated tour-panel inner-panel target-panel" style data-widget-type="cell" data-x="0" data-w="12">…</div>
[11:48:36] <Ty_> Thats what each object returns
[11:48:47] <Ty_> with their respective div id's
[11:49:40] <taplar> ok, so in chrome it doesn't show the offset.  you can see it in ff.  otherwise, the first element is offset 0
[11:50:01] <Ty_> Okay, so since arrays go 0,1,2,3
[11:50:08] <Ty_> that list that was returned is an array?
[11:50:24] <taplar> an object containing an array, yes
[11:50:53] <taplar> instead of doing $()[index] you should really be doing $().eq(index)
[11:51:07] <Ty_> alright, so since it was the 3rd in the list it's offset 2, am I following?
[11:51:24] <taplar> yes
[11:52:04] <Ty_> just pulled it into FF, I see the offset now
[11:52:19] <Ty_> I will replace $()[index] real quick
[11:52:20] <taplar> $(".tour-panel").not('.tour-home')
[11:52:54] <Ty_> so run that code in ff?
[11:53:03] <taplar> try that and look at the difference
[11:53:46] <Ty_> Okay
[11:53:59] <Ty_> so if I undrstand this, it counts the home and that's why it is offset by -1?
[11:54:25] <DFar> Is there a reason why $.mobile.resetActivePageHeight does not work ?
[11:54:42] <taplar> the inclusion of the tour home in the lookup as you have it causes the expected offsets to be one larger than your expecting them to
[11:55:07] <taplar> .not('tour-home') excludes it/them from the result set
[11:55:28] <Ty_> Alright, I'm following.
[11:55:45] <Ty_> So I need to find a way to exclude my tour home in my function where I am clicking links? correct?
[11:56:15] <taplar> with your existing logic, any where where your trying to get an image by the offset, you want to do that with only the images
[11:56:48] <taplar> which is probably the quick fix, but like i mentioned earlier, a better approach long term would probably to refactor that to not be based on indexing
[11:57:03] <taplar> positional based logic, as you've seen, is brittle
[11:58:56] <Ty_> Well I am going to be honest, I have my 2 weeks in here and they are pushing for this tour to be launched and that's it. They don't care how it's written they just want it to work. lol
[11:59:14] <taplar> :)
[11:59:27] <Ty_> So can I include the .not() statement, on all the places where I am searching for images?
[11:59:29] <taplar> no need to leave them with crappy code, ;)  but i understand
[11:59:51] <taplar> i would suggest storing that in the doc ready and reusing the variable
[12:00:02] <Ty_> Well they want to copy someone elses syntax word for word. I'd rather this than them steal.
[12:00:29] <taplar> heh, internet is all about stealing code, :)
[12:00:58] <Ty_> Theres a difference from stealing and refactoring, and stealing all css/html/functionality
[12:01:35] <Ty_> Especially if the code they want is an existing product they don't want to pay for lol
[12:01:45] <taplar> ah, well that's different
[12:01:59] <Ty_> but anyways, can you help me understand how I would rewrite this?
[12:02:25] <taplar> at the start of your doc ready, var $tourPanels = $(".tour-panel").not('.tour-home');
[12:02:25] <Ty_> Since this is the part that is calling by index (correct?)
[12:02:27] <Ty_> $($(".tour-panel")[current]).addClass("fadeOutLeft");     current = parseInt(target_id.split('-')[1]) || 0;
[12:02:39] <taplar> then just use $tourPanels.eq(index) to get the one you want
[12:02:48] <taplar> no need to rewrap it
[12:02:56] <taplar> [] breaks out of the jquery object, eq() does not
[12:03:11] <Ty_> so instead of $($("")[current])  I just use $tourPanels.eq(index)
[12:03:16] <taplar> yup
[12:03:59] <Ty_> do I use the same index? like some say "nextIndex" and others are set for "previousIndex"
[12:04:14] <taplar> 'index' would be your 'current' variable
[12:04:23] <taplar> that's what your current is
[12:04:41] <Ty_> Okay, so current is replaced by index
[12:04:49] <Ty_> then next/previous stay the same?
[12:05:00] <taplar> no, i was just saying index since that's what the parameter is
[12:05:08] <taplar> you can use whatever variable or literal you want
[12:05:25] <taplar> slash need
[12:06:33] <taplar> your logic would pretty much stay the same, just changing it to use that $tourPanels instead
[12:07:40] <Ty_> Okay, so I updated it, and I think its correct
[12:07:48] <taplar> <3
[12:07:50] <Ty_> but I have a few more questions (really sorry about this :( )
[12:08:01] <taplar> np, i have to go in a bit but fire away
[12:08:12] <taplar> and there are others who can help too, :)
[12:08:27] <Ty_> So now that the timeline works
[12:08:44] <Ty_> clicking the side arrow or tab takes you to #target-1, instead of #target
[12:09:09] <Ty_> But I also can't tab back to home, which I think is due to the .not statement
[12:09:17] <taplar> yep
[12:09:42] <taplar> so the arrows and tabbing should be able to go home, just not the timeline?
[12:09:54] <gingitsune> How does one go about attaching a event listener on a svg node?
[12:10:57] <Ty_> Nope, the arrows and tabs break it when trying to go home
[12:11:07] <Ty_> https://preview.hs-sites.com/_hcms/preview/template/multi?template_layout_id=3792192176&is_buffered_template_layout=true&portalId=494351&tc_deviceCategory=DESKTOP#target-3
[12:11:09] <taplar> i'm saying you want them to
[12:11:13] <Ty_> Oh yes
[12:11:17] <taplar> but the links should not
[12:11:23] <Ty_> (sorry didn't catch that) exactly
[12:12:12] <taplar> ok, yeah so for that you'd need to navigate based on all of the images, including home
[12:12:30] <Ty_> yes, so I need a new var?
[12:12:45] <Ty_> since there are 2 different functions for the keys/buttons and timeline
[12:13:06] <taplar> var $tourPanelsAndHome = $(".tour-panel"), $tourPanels = $tourPanelsAndHome.not('.tour-home');
[12:13:49] <taplar> yeah, the vars are better since these are not changing.  caching the lookups can help performance
[12:14:07] <taplar> and also follows the whole DRY principle really
[12:14:18] <Ty_> So just make another var that doesnot include the .not?
[12:14:23] <taplar> yep
[12:14:27] <gingitsune> a regular on('click' does not work
[12:15:44] <yahkob> would it minimize repaints to do something like var foo = $('.someNodes').parent()[0].slice(); foo.find('.someNodes').text('bar') $('.someNodes').parent().empty().append(foo); ?
[12:15:52] <yahkob> Does jQuery do anything like that?
[12:16:16] <taplar> foo wouldn't be applicable for find()
[12:16:23] <taplar> doesn't look like it would be a jquery object
[12:16:30] <yahkob> oh woops
[12:16:34] <yahkob> wrap it in a $()
[12:16:43] <robertmaxrees> if you really care about perf, detach things before you work on them.
[12:16:51] <robertmaxrees> no need to .empty() and stuff ahead of time though.
[12:16:54] <Ty_> Alright, I have that working correctly now, there is a point where back arrow takes it back 2 slides, but I think that has to do with math for the previous function
[12:17:03] <taplar> :)
[12:17:18] <yahkob> So detaching would be more perfomant than actually slicing ?
[12:17:32] <Ty_> One last thing, and dude if you have a paypal, I'd be happy to send you something for helping me out so much
[12:17:33] <robertmaxrees> there's a BIG caveat here: are you seeing performance issues?]
[12:17:47] <taplar> Ty_: it's a teaching room.  s'what we're here for
[12:17:57] <yahkob> No not really :)
[12:18:00] <yahkob> Just for fun
[12:18:07] <robertmaxrees> yahkob then don't worry about it ;)
[12:18:13] <Ty_> but I can tab through all the sections (connect, convert, optimize, target) but if I click on them in the timeline it either does nothing or breaks the slide?
[12:18:15] <yahkob> I will worry about it!
[12:18:16] <yahkob> haha
[12:18:30] <robertmaxrees> seriously though the most performant way to handle dom operations is to detach/use a fragment
[12:18:31] <taplar> i noticed that double clicking a timeline seemed to blank it out
[12:18:36] <yahkob> ah
[12:18:40] <yahkob> detach then attach?
[12:18:40] <robertmaxrees> do all your operations against that, then append it once.
[12:18:49] <yahkob> ah append
[12:18:51] <robertmaxrees> instead of touching the "rendered DOM" over and over.
[12:19:07] <Ty_> I see tha too, if I double click it takes it back 2 slides
[12:19:13] <yahkob> But wouldn't my approach only touch the dom once? versus the detach method doing it twice? :D
[12:19:21] <taplar> Ty_: you'd probably what to do some sort of check in the timeline click handler to check if it's already displayed and if so, do nothing
[12:19:28] <robertmaxrees> yahkob nope, your method would do it multiple times.
[12:19:46] <robertmaxrees> yahkob jquery is doing a lot under the hood for yo.
[12:19:48] <robertmaxrees> *you
[12:19:51] <taplar> but i'm fixing to head out.  have to get to a meeting early.  they're giving out food.
[12:19:53] <yahkob> Hmm slice wouldn't be its own pseudo virtual dom?
[12:19:57] <yahkob> i like yo more
[12:19:57] * taplar has his priorities, heh
[12:20:10] <robertmaxrees> yahkob nope.
[12:20:18] <yahkob> interesting
[12:20:27] <robertmaxrees> yahkob that's just an array method.
[12:20:29] <Ty_> Alright, I'll look into it! I really appreciate all of your help Tap
[12:20:35] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean the jquery slice?
[12:20:41] <yahkob> no just native js slice
[12:20:46] <yahkob> I'm assuming
[12:20:56] <taplar> np, and like i said, others can help to so if you have further questions, let them know, :)
[12:21:00] <yahkob> $('query')[0].slice() would be native js at that point right?
[12:21:15] <Ty_> I'll try my hand at writing the check and go from there!
[12:21:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah, but you can't actually do that :)
[12:21:23] <robertmaxrees> since slice is an array method.
[12:21:25] <Ty_> I'd just be checking if the index = current? correct?
[12:21:29] <robertmaxrees> and [0] gets you a raw DOM node, not an array.
[12:21:57] <yahkob> hmmm let me look at what i was messing with in the console
[12:22:08] <yahkob> maybe it was jquery slice then
[12:22:16] <robertmaxrees> even then.
[12:22:27] <robertmaxrees> because the element would still be in the visible document.
[12:22:47] <yahkob> ah I think it was jquery slice :)
[12:23:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah, even then.  you need to explicitly detach it and append it.
[12:23:16] <yahkob> I thought about detach initially but it wasn't enough for me
[12:23:25] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[12:23:31] <yahkob> haha I will stop being non-productive now
[12:23:47] <yahkob> just being dumb and trying to reinvent the wheels on some stuff for work
[12:24:09] <yahkob> just bored and getting curious.. detach was my first thought but then I wanted to try more stuff heh
[12:24:21] <robertmaxrees> if you want the most efficient mechanism, check out document fragments.
[12:24:24] <robertmaxrees> outside of jquery.
[12:25:11] <yahkob> Ahh looks interesting thanks
[12:25:32] <graphettion> robertmaxrees: I'm convincing the webs about you and taplar's approach and it's working :)
[12:25:49] <robertmaxrees> graphettion hrm?
[12:25:55] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're the search and tags guy.
[12:25:58] <graphettion> We spoke about it last night.
[12:25:59] <graphettion> yeah
[12:26:05] <robertmaxrees> hah, awesome :)
[12:26:14] <yahkob> Hmm I wonder if React uses document fragments under the hood
[12:26:14] <graphettion> We are doing a search with filters
[12:26:17] <graphettion> w00t!
[12:26:18] <robertmaxrees> you're the new perspective on the team.  if they're smart, they'll listen.
[12:26:23] <robertmaxrees> nice!
[12:26:31] <robertmaxrees> yahkob sort of.
[12:26:42] <robertmaxrees> react uses a virtual dom with diffing to minimize what does/doesn't change.
[12:26:45] <robertmaxrees> it's really efficient.
[12:26:59] <graphettion> hehe, first thing is first, I'm going to sort by title though, then expand. Anyway, I'll let you know how it goes. May be a while.
[12:27:24] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.  you're on the first step of a MUCH better user experience.
[12:27:42] <yahkob> Yeah I wonder how do that
[12:27:45] <graphettion> w00t! Thanks for your help. Ya'll rock.
[12:27:50] <robertmaxrees> yahkob hrm?
[12:27:54] <yahkob> What is the virtual dom? not a document fragment?
[12:28:03] <yahkob> I guess i should ask in react :P
[12:28:10] <robertmaxrees> https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/glossary.html yahkob
[12:38:46] <noregret> i have a form with only checkboxes, how can I check if they are all are non-checked?
[12:39:21] <robertmaxrees> check $('form').find('input').length  against a filtered list of unchecked inputs.
[12:42:15] <noregret> robertmaxrees: i don't get, what's a filtered list unchecked inputs?
[12:42:21] <noregret> of unchecked*
[12:42:29] <robertmaxrees> use .filter()
[12:42:36] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[12:43:46] <noregret> robertmaxrees: actually, .is(':checked') is enough i guess
[12:44:02] <noregret> robertmaxrees: it gives true if at least one is checked and false if all are unchceked
[12:44:10] <robertmaxrees> you could use that, too.
[12:44:23] <robertmaxrees> i tend to avoid selectors like that, but a totally valid option :)
[12:51:06] <noregret> i see
[12:58:26] <gambl0re> http://jsbin.com/yisificere/edit?html,output
[12:58:35] <gambl0re> why isnt the post appending to the li element
[12:58:56] <robertmaxrees> really?
[12:59:01] <robertmaxrees> $(body).text("post");
[12:59:07] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid thing.
[13:00:33] <gambl0re> $('body').text("post") ??
[13:00:37] <gambl0re> isnt that how its done?
[13:00:43] <robertmaxrees> that's valiud.
[13:00:45] <robertmaxrees> $(body) isn't.
[13:00:56] <robertmaxrees> unless body is a var.
[13:01:05] <gambl0re> ok im trying to do this..
[13:01:06] <robertmaxrees> and that's going to set the text of the body tag.
[13:01:09] <robertmaxrees> not of an LI.
[13:01:40] <gambl0re> $('body').text('<li>'+post+'</li>')
[13:01:54] <gambl0re> it should insert post between the li tags ?
[13:01:59] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid HTML.
[13:02:08] <gambl0re> why
[13:02:08] <robertmaxrees> you can only put LIs as children of a UL or OL
[13:02:24] <gambl0re> $('body').text('<ul><li>'+post+'</li></ul>')
[13:02:25] <gambl0re> there
[13:02:31] <robertmaxrees> need html
[13:02:32] <robertmaxrees> not text
[13:02:44] <gambl0re> $('body').html('<ul><li>'+post+'</li></ul>')
[13:02:48] <robertmaxrees> try it.
[13:02:51] <robertmaxrees> see for yourself.
[13:03:21] <gambl0re> its not working
[13:03:30] <gambl0re> http://jsbin.com/yisificere/edit?html,output
[13:03:39] <robertmaxrees> that isn't updating for me.
[13:03:50] <gambl0re> its outputting the <ul><li></ul></li> as strings?
[13:04:04] <robertmaxrees> it's still the bad code you had earlier.
[13:04:14] <robertmaxrees> what's 'post' supposed to be?
[13:04:17] <gambl0re> http://jsbin.com/xamibe/1/edit?html,output
[13:04:24] <gambl0re> should update
[13:04:37] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:04:45] <robertmaxrees> that's still using .text()
[13:04:56] <gambl0re> oh
[13:04:58] <robertmaxrees> and post is an array.
[13:05:02] <robertmaxrees> not a string.
[13:05:06] <robertmaxrees> so that's not going to do what you wnat.
[13:05:11] <robertmaxrees> *want
[13:06:05] <gambl0re> how do i make east post its own list item?
[13:06:07] <gambl0re> each
[13:06:33] <gambl0re> right now all the items is bunched into one li
[13:06:36] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:06:39] <gambl0re> i want 3 seperate li
[13:06:41] <robertmaxrees> becuase you're coercing an array into a string.
[13:06:49] <robertmaxrees> how do you think you'd do it?
[13:07:22] <gambl0re> i want to wrap li's isnide the map function but i know it wont work
[13:07:33] <robertmaxrees> it won't?
[13:07:42] <robertmaxrees> it could, but it's still not what you want to do.
[13:08:21] <gambl0re> http://jsbin.com/xamibe/edit?html,output
[13:08:32] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:08:37] <robertmaxrees> you're dealing with strings there, buddy
[13:08:45] <robertmaxrees> can't just randomly insert html like that.
[13:09:12] <gambl0re> in reactjs you can do that. how do i do something like that in jquery
[13:09:22] <robertmaxrees> jquery and react are two dsifferent tools.
[13:09:25] <gambl0re> i know...
[13:09:26] <robertmaxrees> you don't have jsx available.
[13:09:28] <robertmaxrees> so it's strings.
[13:09:39] <robertmaxrees> and you'll need to 2 step this process.
[13:09:44] <robertmaxrees> concat the strings in the map, for starters.
[13:10:19] <gambl0re> ok thanks
[13:10:37] <robertmaxrees> after that's done, you want to .join('') that array when you append it.
[13:10:49] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're relying on a quirk of the language, which is a bad idea.
[13:11:23] <gambl0re> ok thanks robert...
[13:11:25] <gambl0re> ill try
[13:11:56] <robertmaxrees> you should really hit up a javascript tutorial.
[13:14:11] <gambl0re> i havent used jquery in a long time...
[13:14:19] <robertmaxrees> none of these issues are jquery specific fwiw.
[13:20:02] <gambl0re> https://jsfiddle.net/reactjs/69z2wepo/
[13:21:06] <robertmaxrees> rioght.
[13:21:08] <robertmaxrees> that's react.
[13:21:10] <robertmaxrees> not jquery.
[13:21:17] <robertmaxrees> or plain javascript.
[13:21:17] <gambl0re> ther you go
[13:21:18] <gambl0re> https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/30708/
[13:21:22] <robertmaxrees> that uses a syntax called jsx.
[13:21:34] <robertmaxrees> so then you're rather use JSX>
[13:21:53] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.  totally different then what you wanted before.
[13:22:31] <gambl0re> do you use react?
[13:22:49] <janimator0> Need help with code. I would like to make a gif that plays when hover over, but also has a loading bar when gif loads. I have some code that works well, just can't figure out how to add the loading image. Where can I paste code for help
[13:22:52] <robertmaxrees> i'd like to, but the projects i'm on right now aren't using them.
[13:23:08] <robertmaxrees> janimator0 we tend to prefer jsfiddle around here.
[13:23:48] <janimator0> will js fiddle allow this kind of functionality
[13:23:49] <janimator0> ?
[13:24:00] <janimator0> image to loading image to gif on mouse hover?
[13:24:05] <robertmaxrees> janimator0 yep.  it's for simple, standalone examples.
[13:24:19] <robertmaxrees> just a place to demonstrap.
[13:24:25] <robertmaxrees> *demonstrate.  it's not your solution.
[13:24:32] <janimator0> oh
[13:24:33] <janimator0> gotcha
[13:26:17] <janimator0> https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=AfNVo55qhd
[13:26:34] <janimator0> So i would like to add a loading image to this gif. https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=AfNVo55qhd
[13:26:55] <robertmaxrees> your tags are all messed up btw.
[13:27:47] <robertmaxrees> missing a closing </a> and you don't include a body tag for fiddles - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1w7afcxa/1/ is what you want.
[13:28:09] <robertmaxrees> also, you want the "mouseenter" event, not the "mouseover" event.
[13:28:21] <robertmaxrees> as for the loading animation - why do you want that?>
[13:28:29] <robertmaxrees> you realize that it'll take time for that to load, too, right?
[13:29:07] <janimator0> i guess i should explain why aswell ....
[13:29:23] <janimator0> this is my web site.
[13:29:24] <janimator0> http://www.artisanimation.com/animations.html
[13:30:33] <janimator0> It has lot's of gif's so It's not good for them to load all at once. which is how it was. My solution was to have them all seperate load on mouse havrer. Problem is sometimes they take long to load and you don't realize they're loading . hence why im looking to implement a wuick image to signify that it's loading
[13:30:40] <sigdk> hello, what are the complications of the following ajax request to the backend: http://paste.debian.net/379390/   ? This is a function that validates the uniqueness of a username during registration. The problem is that when I use it... it always returns true ... (the backend does it job properly). Could it be that it returns before the response is fetched ?
[13:30:44] <robertmaxrees> how many gifs are there, janimator0?
[13:31:10] <robertmaxrees> sigdk yep.
[13:31:11] <janimator0> 38 on my page
[13:31:27] <janimator0> can potentially be more
[13:31:29] <robertmaxrees> sigdk anything that relies on the request needs to be fired in the .done()/success callbak.
[13:31:34] <robertmaxrees> janimator0 how heavy is the pageweight?
[13:32:29] <robertmaxrees> because just implementing the conditional load sould be enough.
[13:32:31] <janimator0> I'm not sure. Web dev is not my field
[13:32:42] <robertmaxrees> loading animations are something best avoided at all costs.
[13:33:24] <janimator0> what are you suggesting for that page?
[13:33:27] <robertmaxrees> also fwiw you can't invent property names - so your prop('originalSrc') really should be .data('originalSrc')
[13:34:35] <robertmaxrees> and my first suggestion is to compress everything.,
[13:34:35] <robertmaxrees> this page is almost 2 megs.
[13:34:35] <robertmaxrees> and nothing looks like it's caching.
[13:34:42] <robertmaxrees> oh, 2.6 megs wow.
[13:34:47] <janimator0> just for the record it took me a month to figure out that code
[13:34:50] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I didn't get it. Does't the async: false, and the fact that I have request.success(...) guarantee that the call is blocking and syncronous ?
[13:34:50] <janimator0> :p
[13:34:55] <janimator0> so ill do my best.
[13:35:04] <robertmaxrees> sigdk async:false should never be used.
[13:35:23] <robertmaxrees> sigdk and that doesn't change what your code is doing.
[13:35:34] <robertmaxrees> you really need to put your logic in the callback.
[13:36:08] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I'd appreciate some sample code... any reference ?
[13:36:17] <robertmaxrees> janimator0 https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.artisanimation.com%2Fanimations.html this should help.
[13:36:19] <sigdk> why async: false is never used ?
[13:36:26] <robertmaxrees> you're locking the browser.
[13:36:37] <robertmaxrees> the user can't do anything else.
[13:37:22] <robertmaxrees> sigdk are you using jquery validate?
[13:37:38] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, yes
[13:37:40] <robertmaxrees> jqueryvalidation.org/remote-method/
[13:37:41] <robertmaxrees> do this then.
[13:40:14] <janimator0> Is there a place where i can quickly pay someone to type me a solution. It's not something i want to dwell over
[13:40:24] <robertmaxrees> janimator0 not here? :)
[13:40:28] <robertmaxrees> maybe try #web?
[13:40:36] <robertmaxrees> and #freelance
[13:40:44] <janimator0> I can pay here
[13:40:51] <robertmaxrees> this is a support channel.
[13:40:55] <janimator0> gotcha
[13:40:59] <robertmaxrees> we don't exchange money here :)
[13:41:12] <janimator0> lol I understand, thanks for the help tho
[13:41:17] <robertmaxrees> it's all good :)  good luck!
[13:41:25] <taplar> we share $, no $$$
[13:41:39] * taplar had to
[13:41:46] <robertmaxrees> hahhah
[13:43:08] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, what do I do with the response ? Shouldn't I process it as well ? currently the server sends a json object { isunique: true/false }.
[13:43:47] <robertmaxrees> sigdk that documentation only shows you how to interface with a remote server.  it's expecting a return out of the callback, right?
[13:45:03] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I guess... That one shows only how to send the username
[13:45:09] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:45:09] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:45:40] <hlvwrk> i love u all.
[13:45:43] <hlvwrk> just saying that.
[13:45:48] <taplar> weirdo
[13:45:50] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I see only a request. Not how to handle the response
[13:45:53] * hlvwrk cries
[13:45:54] <robertmaxrees> sigdk "The serverside resource is called via jQuery.ajax (XMLHttpRequest) and gets a key/value pair corresponding to the name of the validated element and its value as a GET parameter. The serverside response must be a JSON string that must be "true" for valid elements, and can be "false", undefined, or null for invalid elements, using the default error message. If the serverside response is
[13:45:55] <robertmaxrees> a string, eg. "That name is already taken, try peter123 instead", this string will be displayed as a custom error message in place of the default."
[13:45:55] <sigdk> and where
[13:45:56] <taplar> :)
[13:46:02] <robertmaxrees> try reading the documentation duder.
[13:46:25] <gambl0re> i know you dont know react, but maybe you can help me
[13:46:25] <gambl0re> https://jsfiddle.net/69z2wepo/30711/
[13:46:34] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re wrong channel for react support.
[13:46:40] <robertmaxrees> try #react instead.
[13:46:56] <sigdk> that fiddle has been updated 32K times...
[13:47:21] <robertmaxrees> something tells me it's base on a base one that people keep using for their examples and tinkering.
[13:47:31] <robertmaxrees> *based on a base - weird way for me to put that.
[13:48:21] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I'll go check. Sorry if that 's something obvious...  and btw, I think my approach is not wrong. I'm almost sure I saw it at the documentation how to add a method for validation
[13:48:46] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, there it is: http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod/
[13:48:51] <robertmaxrees> sigdk except that you want to validate against a remote resource, which has different requirements.
[13:49:15] <robertmaxrees> and doesn't work like you'd want it to, something you've already experienced.
[13:52:19] <Ty_> Hey guys what's goin on?
[13:52:29] <robertmaxrees> notta lotta.
[13:52:32] <robertmaxrees> yourself?
[13:52:59] <Ty_> Just trying to figure out some stuff, same old haha
[13:53:10] <robertmaxrees> good times.
[13:55:51] <Ty_> So taplar was helping me earlier, but I can't seem to figure out why I can't get this slide to jump to an id
[13:56:38] <robertmaxrees> feel free to just ask your questions.
[13:56:45] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[13:57:07] <Ty_> So here is my page: https://preview.hs-sites.com/_hcms/preview/template/multi?template_layout_id=3792192176&is_buffered_template_layout=true&portalId=494351&tc_deviceCategory=DESKTOP&__hstc=121304535.93a684b8c79794b1469036804d39bdae.1449151588257.1455032498381.1455037895519.40&__hssc=121304535.6.1455037895519&__hsfp=4049909196#target-3
[13:57:12] <robertmaxrees> yeesh.
[13:57:15] <Zzaichik> whoa
[13:57:19] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:57:19] <Zzaichik> easy
[13:57:28] <robertmaxrees> so what's your question?
[13:57:51] <Ty_> you can tab left and right with arrow keys or the buttons on the side, but if you look at the timeline, clicking connect, convert, and optimize won't bring you to their group of slides
[13:58:18] <gambl0re> is that your site man?
[13:58:24] <Ty_> Yes
[13:58:30] <Ty_> It's a testing server
[13:58:31] <robertmaxrees> Ty_ so can you share the code you're using to try to accomplish that?
[13:58:32] <morissette> Hello, can any one assist me with the animate function?
[13:58:34] <gambl0re> fckuing nice man..
[13:58:53] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean when you're on a page?
[13:58:53] <Ty_> One moment Robert, I'll paste bin my jQuery
[13:58:56] <morissette> Here is the code snipper: https://bpaste.net/show/a73ca3adc5bd
[13:59:00] <robertmaxrees> nah slow down.
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> the producttour, right?
[13:59:33] <Ty_> yes
[13:59:41] <robertmaxrees> ok yeah share yoour code.
[13:59:42] <Ty_> Here is my jquery: https://bpaste.net/show/c0b011db64c9
[13:59:48] <robertmaxrees> *javascript.
[13:59:50] <robertmaxrees> jquery isn't a language :)
[14:00:02] <Ty_> Haha, well you know what I mean!
[14:00:19] <Ty_> I always say JS, but feel like I need to specify it as jquery
[14:00:23] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:00:25] <robertmaxrees> it's just JS.
[14:00:48] <robertmaxrees> so do you see for first problem?
[14:00:57] <robertmaxrees> you define current after you try to use it.
[14:01:24] <robertmaxrees> also, try doing a console.log of current before you do your transition.
[14:01:53] <Ty_> Where am I using it before defining it?
[14:02:01] <robertmaxrees> $('.slideshow-timeline a').click(function() {
[14:02:02] <robertmaxrees> see this?
[14:02:22] <robertmaxrees> unless current is supposed to change after yu do $allTourPanels.eq(current).addClass("fadeOutLeft");
[14:02:50] <Ty_> Okay, I will move that below my vars
[14:02:58] <robertmaxrees> hold up -
[14:03:04] <robertmaxrees> your other code does it like that it looks like.
[14:03:16] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:03:22] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with your console?
[14:03:41] <Ty_> Yes I know about the console
[14:03:58] <robertmaxrees> so use it :) console log your objects and indices to check.
[14:04:01] <Ty_> I am using 2 different functions, one for the arrow keys/buttons and another for the timeline
[14:04:07] <robertmaxrees> yeah i see it :)
[14:04:18] <robertmaxrees> your console will become your best friend in cases like that.
[14:04:35] <Ty_> I guess I don't understand the function of logging my objects?
[14:04:55] <robertmaxrees> so you said you don't understand why it doesn't work, right?
[14:05:15] <Ty_> Yes
[14:05:25] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe current = parseInt(target_id.split('-')[1]) || 0; isn't doing what you think it is, right?
[14:05:37] <robertmaxrees> so check things - console.log(current); - is that wrong?
[14:05:53] <robertmaxrees> if so, console.log(target_id); and console.log(target_id.split('-')); etc.
[14:06:03] <robertmaxrees> check your values.  are they really what you think they are?
[14:07:40] <Ty_> Well from my understanding the split() is helping me number my slides (I didn't write all of this function) I only wrote the arrowkys and buttons
[14:07:47] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:07:49] <robertmaxrees> so check your values.
[14:07:54] <robertmaxrees> that's why you console.log() these things.
[14:08:01] <robertmaxrees> to make sure they are what you expect them to be,.
[14:08:39] <Ty_> Okay so I logged it after the split command, updating now
[14:08:50] <robertmaxrees> check the value yourself - is it what you're expecting?
[14:09:25] <Ty_> it returns: ["#connect"] when clicking connect
[14:09:34] <Ty_> which is the target id for the intro of the connect page
[14:09:42] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[14:10:02] <robertmaxrees> $allTourPanels.eq(current) - it wants current to be a number.
[14:10:16] <robertmaxrees> current = parseInt(target_id.split('-')[1]) || 0; is probably always returning 0 as a result.
[14:10:26] <Ty_> Okay
[14:10:33] <robertmaxrees> that make sense?
[14:10:47] <Ty_> just to add to that, the function is no $tourPanels, as I don't want to count from the tour home
[14:11:07] <Ty_> $tourPanels var includes .not(".tour-home");
[14:11:09] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with anything.
[14:11:16] <Ty_> Okay, just making sure
[14:11:31] <robertmaxrees> current = parseInt(target_id.split('-')[1]) || 0; returns the index or 0.
[14:11:38] <Ty_> so if I click other links while logging my split
[14:11:48] <robertmaxrees> you're getting strings, right?
[14:12:24] <Ty_> It's returning arrays:  ["#target", "5"]
[14:12:37] <robertmaxrees> so does that link work correctly?
[14:12:41] <Ty_> the #target being the group, the 5 being the data number
[14:12:42] <Ty_> yes
[14:12:59] <robertmaxrees> so you have one link that doesn't work correctly, right?
[14:13:11] <robertmaxrees> so look at the href - what makes that one different?
[14:13:32] <Ty_> Well what it is, is that link links to another panel
[14:13:48] <Ty_> The href is correct to the id I want to link to, and my split returns it as well
[14:14:01] <robertmaxrees> but the split is different for all the other links, right?
[14:14:21] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I'm using ajax calls with async false in other parts of the code... how can I implement these correctly ? you said something about .done() method before
[14:14:46] <Ty_> Yes, they all return something different
[14:14:47] <robertmaxrees> sigdk any logic that relies on the ajax call finishing should be in the .done()/.then() callback.
[14:15:03] <Ty_> ["#connect"], ["#convert"], ["#optimize"]
[14:15:07] <robertmaxrees> Ty_ right, but the ones that function return that array with a name and a number, right?
[14:15:20] <robertmaxrees> because target works correctly, right?
[14:15:56] <sigdk> g2g atm, I'll check it. thanks
[14:16:04] <Ty_> The only ones that return an array with name and number are the inner sections, the main "target" just returns ["#target"]
[14:16:32] <robertmaxrees> okay, then my initial point still stands.
[14:16:41] <robertmaxrees> $allTourPanels.eq(current).addClass("active-tour fadeInRight"); expects an index, not an ID.
[14:16:53] <robertmaxrees> does that make sense?
[14:17:22] <Ty_> Well if I tab into the connect option, then click the second option, I get ["#connect", "2"] in console
[14:17:39] <Ty_> but it takes me to the page that is ["#target-2"]
[14:18:05] <Ty_> so it seems that it's using up the non array and treating it as the same, and it's only counting the number to 5?
[14:18:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:18:49] <Ty_> If I tab over with arrow keys, it will count 1 - 16+
[14:18:51] <robertmaxrees> your issue is purely that you're not updating that current var correctly.
[14:19:08] <Ty_> so it counts each slide as a seperate index
[14:19:20] <Ty_> So do I have to run an update on current?
[14:19:23] <robertmaxrees> right, except your connect/convert/optimize links don't have indexes on them.
[14:19:43] <robertmaxrees> every other link down in your footer has an index.
[14:19:53] <robertmaxrees> connect/convert/optimize don't.  at least not in the href.
[14:20:14] <Ty_> Connect/convert/optimize should be linked to #connect/#convert/#optimze
[14:20:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:20:23] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[14:20:27] <Ty_> which is what they return in console
[14:20:31] <robertmaxrees> but your code assumes you're passing in an index.
[14:20:41] <robertmaxrees> $allTourPanels.eq(current).addClass("active-tour fadeInRight"); - eq() takes an index.
[14:20:44] <robertmaxrees> a number.
[14:20:46] <robertmaxrees> not an id.
[14:21:18] <Ty_> So my timeline is running off ids, but my keys/buttons are using index?
[14:21:31] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:21:37] <robertmaxrees> all of this code operates off of indexes.
[14:21:44] <robertmaxrees> all of the js you've shown at least.
[14:21:48] <Ty_> Alright, I'm following
[14:22:06] <robertmaxrees> so this code is incorrect for those major sections.
[14:23:39] <Ty_> So I'll need a new function just to click into the big sections
[14:23:40] <Ty_> ?
[14:23:52] <robertmaxrees> all of your logic for the big sections doesn't work at all actually.
[14:24:02] <robertmaxrees> in fact, i'm seeing things shift around awkwardly right now.
[14:24:26] <Ty_> if you tab to another section, you can click into target
[14:24:29] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting cases where i click "wealth screening", and i don't actually go there, or i click it and then click right then click back.
[14:24:50] <robertmaxrees> and that second case takes me to FRM analysis after half a second.
[14:25:06] <robertmaxrees> why is this all based off if indexes anyway?
[14:25:20] <robertmaxrees> probably the left/right arrow setup?>
[14:25:36] <Ty_> We use a special framework that we have to build with modules and I figured this would be the better way to do it
[14:25:51] <robertmaxrees> either way, you need to figure out how to handle those major sections.
[14:25:57] <robertmaxrees> since all your code operates using indexes.
[14:25:58] <robertmaxrees> not IDs.
[14:26:03] <Ty_> Since I was going to try and target each section with ids
[14:26:07] <ngharo> here's a way without relying on indexes: https://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/gjyswrr9/26/ (needed a distraction from work)
[14:26:20] <robertmaxrees> niiice.
[14:26:41] <robertmaxrees> check out what ngharo's done and see if you can't take some lessons from that.
[14:28:01] <Ty_> In Ngharo's example, if you click wealth screening, it takes you to segmentation
[14:28:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:28:15] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what your issue is though?
[14:28:27] <Ty_> which was one of the problems I had before where it counts the homepage as an index
[14:31:08] <Ty_> I think so
[14:31:24] <Ty_> it can't seperate the indexs of the main section
[14:33:50] <robertmaxrees> you're relying on index always.  those main sections don't have an index.
[14:34:40] <Ty_> How can I give them an index?
[14:34:59] <Ty_> It's not like they are being excluded like the homepage one is?
[14:35:00] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't look like it'll work that way.
[14:35:46] <Ty_> Do you think it would help if I showed you what I was trying to emulate?
[14:35:54] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[14:35:54] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:36:01] <Ty_> haha, well shit
[14:36:05] <robertmaxrees> i know exactly what you're trying to do, but you have a massive page as an example.
[14:36:15] <robertmaxrees> you have multiple carousels that you want to swap between when you're done with one.
[14:36:29] <Ty_> Well yes and no
[14:36:39] <robertmaxrees> absolutely yes :)
[14:36:41] <Ty_> they are supposed to be treated as 1 carousel
[14:36:54] <robertmaxrees> except they're not - each section is one carousel.
[14:37:04] <robertmaxrees> but clicking "next" on a final slide takes you to the next carousel.
[14:37:59] <Ty_> I get what you're saying, but hear me out
[14:38:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:38:20] <Ty_> The template is set up to be x-amount of slides, right? It's all the same carousel
[14:38:26] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:38:35] <Ty_> with slides in between to seperate them
[14:38:39] <robertmaxrees> trust me, the mental overhead of doing it your way is a MASSIVE PITA.
[14:38:49] <Scriptonaut> Hey guys, I found this line of code that someone wrote in my codebase. They seem to be defining a parameter to be passed to .fadeOut's complete function. I can't find any documentation on this. Here is the line: .fadeOut(300, function(e) { console.log(e); e.remove() });
[14:38:56] <robertmaxrees> because of those links to each section.
[14:39:00] <Ty_> That was how we were planning it
[14:39:16] <Scriptonaut> My question is, what is the "e" parameter there supposed to be? It's undefined when the code is run
[14:39:19] <robertmaxrees> Ty_ right, but you really want multiple carousels.
[14:39:34] <robertmaxrees> with logic hooked into the next/prev buttons for when they're the first/last slids respectively.
[14:39:40] <robertmaxrees> that'll be MUCH easier to do.
[14:39:44] <Ty_> Oh, I thought you were saying that's how I WAS doing it
[14:40:07] <robertmaxrees> ScriptThis sounds like somebody assumeds that would have an event object or something.
[14:40:10] <robertmaxrees> err, Scriptonaut
[14:40:15] <robertmaxrees> check the jquery docs for more info.
[14:40:36] <Scriptonaut> I am reading the jquery docs, there is no mention or example of passing the complete function a parameter
[14:40:44] <robertmaxrees> then it doesn't take one.
[14:40:50] <Scriptonaut> ok, thanks
[14:40:53] <robertmaxrees> somebody was mistaken :)
[14:40:58] <robertmaxrees> Ty_ nope.
[14:41:05] <robertmaxrees> that's how you want to do it though.
[14:41:11] <robertmaxrees> bbiab lunch
[14:41:12] <Ty_> So I guess, what are my options
[14:41:49] <robertmaxrees> before i go - either figure out this weird index thing or implement the multi carousel idea.  the latter might take about the same amount of time?  not sure.
[14:52:59] <skanna> android is scrolling this and aint show the overlay but ios is showing it while scrolling.. http://www.hastebin.com/ileyagovel.coffee any idears?
[15:01:06] <Ty_> hey ngharo, are you still here?
[15:01:32] <Ty_> @ngharo oops, forgot to tag
[15:02:04] <ngharo> Yep
[15:02:18] <Ty_> Could you do some explaining on that code example for me?
[15:02:51] <Ty_> Just so I can try and understand it, right now it's live on my test server and I have some weird things going on
[15:03:15] <ngharo> sure
[15:03:24] <ngharo> overall it doesnt care about where things are positioned
[15:04:04] <Ty_> Alright, I see that happening, the main thing is, if I click a main section, then use arrow keys to scroll, it scrolls the main sections rather than interior slides?
[15:04:58] <ngharo> looking at my fiddle, what do you mean by by main sections?
[15:05:57] <Ty_> Well base it off my test server, you'll see what I mean: https://preview.hs-sites.com/_hcms/preview/template/multi?template_layout_id=3792192176&is_buffered_template_layout=true&portalId=494351&tc_deviceCategory=DESKTOP&__hstc=121304535.93a684b8c79794b1469036804d39bdae.1449151588257.1455032498381.1455037895519.40&__hssc=121304535.6.1455037895519&__hsfp=4049909196#target-3
[15:06:15] <Ty_> It has the 4 sections and 5 'slides' in each
[15:08:03] <ngharo> ahh i see
[15:11:07] <ngharo> what do you want to happen when you reach the end of a section and press "next"
[15:11:16] <ngharo> to go the main view of the next section?
[15:16:08] <Ty_> Sorry had to leave the room for a phonecall, back now
[15:16:20] <Ty_> I would like it to go to the 'intro' slide of the next section
[15:18:18] <ngharo> goto_next/goto_prev work by looking at the current slide link, then traversing around to figure out what's next
[15:18:24] <ngharo> so that logic just needs to change a little
[15:18:44] <ngharo> to know if it's on a main section or not
[15:19:09] <Ty_> just remove the .current-section?
[15:20:15] <ngharo> i think you'd need to first check if $('a.selected').parent() is 'active-target-main'
[15:20:39] <ngharo> then if so, jump into a sub-slide if going 'next' else jump back to previous 'intro'
[15:20:41] <Ty_> So I removed that and it lets me scroll through the whole way
[15:21:01] <Ty_> but if I click onto a main section, it still scrolls through only the main sections
[15:21:04] <ngharo> oh nice
[15:28:15] <Ty_> How can I get it to cycle all slides no matter where I click?
[15:28:51] <ngharo> https://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/gjyswrr9/27/ try these goto_next/goto_previous functions
[15:28:57] <Ty_> I don;t know what logic you used to handle the <href> clicks
[15:29:45] <ngharo> it just looks for '#foobar' slide where foobar is the href value
[15:29:57] <ngharo> and tags it 'selected' to know its active
[15:30:12] <ngharo> then we also know whatever else is selected is the previous active slide
[15:30:52] <Ty_> Alright, so it is like 90% of the way there thankfully
[15:31:21] <Ty_> I just have to find a way to check if it's on a parent slide after click and to make it go to the next 'a' instead of the next parent
[15:34:09] <ngharo> the markup is so crazy it's hard for me to wrap my head around
[15:34:20] <ngharo> but i think i see the problem with the code i just updated for you
[15:35:07] <robert_lunch> back
[15:36:05] <Ty_> Yeah it's rough cause every template gets generic classes haha
[15:36:36] <ngharo> are you able to add a common class to the <li>'s of the main section links
[15:37:31] <Ty_> Yes, I could do that
[15:38:16] <ngharo> yeah, tag them with a class like "section" for instance
[15:38:38] <ngharo> so we no they're upper level section links that contains sub-slides
[15:38:57] <ngharo> s/no/know/
[15:38:57] <b-ot> Correction, <ngharo> so we know they're upper level section links that contains sub-slides
[15:41:15] <Ty_> Okay it will take me a couple minutes to update this
[15:41:28] <Ty_> assume the class name is "main-section"
[15:42:28] <ngharo> are you aware that there are 22 '.slideshow-timeline's ?
[15:42:33] <ngharo> in your markup
[15:43:26] <Ty_> Yes
[15:43:47] <Ty_> The way I was doing it would needed the timeline to be updated on each slide
[15:44:02] <Ty_> but this way might be different where I only need one (and I'll be thankful if it is
[15:44:26] <Ty_> https://preview.hs-sites.com/_hcms/preview/template/multi?template_layout_id=3792192176&is_buffered_template_layout=true&portalId=494351&tc_deviceCategory=DESKTOP
[15:46:52] <ngharo> $current_li.is(".active-target-main") - this was trying to check for main sections
[15:47:12] <ngharo> so change the selector to '.main-section' now, both occurences
[15:48:00] <ngharo> but not all your "main sections" are tagged with the class main-section
[15:48:05] <ngharo> so i dunno, that markup is bonkers
[15:48:17] <Ty_> Yeah, it's a little rough to say the least
[15:48:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:48:43] <Ty_> I only tagged the target and connect sections for now just to make sure it works
[15:49:33] <ngharo> put $('.slideshow-timeline > li') in your console, that's what should be tagged
[15:49:52] <ngharo> but hopefully you reduce that so only 4 elements show up like expected lol
[15:51:03] <Ty_> let me clone and refactor that nav, 1 moment
[15:58:59] <Ty_> Alright
[15:59:01] <Ty_> I'm back
[15:59:13] <Ty_> it's a little messy but it will work for now: https://preview.hs-sites.com/_hcms/preview/template/multi?template_layout_id=3862706608&is_buffered_template_layout=true&portalId=494351&tc_deviceCategory=DESKTOP
[15:59:20] <Ty_> Should only have 1 nav now
[16:05:20] <noregret> in an anchor's click event, im' .submit()ing a form, can I add a field to it before it gets POSTed?
[16:06:32] <robertmaxrees> have you tried it?
[16:07:26] <noregret> robertmaxrees: i dont' know the syntax to do =)
[16:07:47] <robertmaxrees> do you know how to append an element?
[16:08:17] <noregret> robertmaxrees: yeah, $().append()
[16:08:25] <robertmaxrees> sooo try that :)
[16:08:42] <noregret> hmm, ok then
[16:23:44] <taplar> Ty_: playing around: https://jsfiddle.net/gjyswrr9/29/
[16:27:47] <ngharo> :D
[16:31:35] <Ty_> THANK YOU SO MUCH TAPLAR
[16:31:40] <taplar> woah
[16:31:43] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:31:44] <Ty_> These really saved me :)
[16:31:50] <taplar> any questions?
[16:31:56] <Ty_> thanks for all the help guys, I would be lost
[16:31:57] <robertmaxrees> Ty_ you might want to check out learn.jquery.com and fixingthesejquery.com
[16:32:28] <Ty_> Will do, bookmarking those right now
[16:32:36] <robertmaxrees> read them asap.
[16:32:44] <robertmaxrees> because they would've saved you lots of headaches today.
[16:32:45] <Ty_> Tap, this is using ids correct? as opposed to indexes?
[16:33:05] <taplar> for the links it's using the href (which is the id) to find the element
[16:33:36] <taplar> ln 41
[16:33:48] <Ty_> and the buttons are back to the index?
[16:34:10] <taplar> nav looks up which one has the class selected on it
[16:34:20] <taplar> and adjusts based on it's index in the entire list
[16:34:56] <Ty_> Gotcha, I will look into it
[16:34:57] <taplar> thats in the goToPreviousPanel and goToNextPanel funcitons
[16:35:39] <Ty_> looking at them now
[16:48:25] <taplar> i like people that use the phrase 'dead in the water'
[16:48:35] <taplar> cause i guess 'dead' isn't sufficient
[16:48:58] <robertmaxrees> it's the impending doom i think.
[16:50:31] <Zzaichik> DOOOOOM
[16:50:35] <arc_> it doesn't mean literally dead
[16:50:40] <taplar> lol
[16:50:49] <arc_> but i guess dead doesn't have to mean literally dead either
[16:50:59] <robertmaxrees> reference to your ship.

[17:04:40] <robertmaxrees> whuddup
[17:04:49] <royalty> i am having trouble attaching an event to something created by javascript
[17:04:52] <royalty> via ajax
[17:05:01] <robertmaxrees> event delegation :)
[17:05:03] <royalty> I am using after to inject some html
[17:05:10] <royalty> .after(data);
[17:05:12] <robertmaxrees> bind to a parent element instead.

[17:06:54] <royalty> robertmaxrees, awesome i'm reading
[17:07:07] <robertmaxrees> royalty don't skip straight to the examples - actually read them btw.
[17:07:16] <robertmaxrees> people skip reading and go to the examples and then mess it up :)
[17:07:23] * taplar holds back on making a hooked on phon.... joke
[17:07:26] <royalty> robertmaxrees, i like to take my time, i'm a patient old man
[17:07:31] <robertmaxrees> :) it's all good.
[17:07:39] <royalty> i'm actually only 27
[17:07:41] <royalty> whatever
[17:07:49] <robertmaxrees> haha younger than I am at least.
[17:13:54] <royalty> robertmaxrees, i got it going, almost don't want to read the rest
[17:14:13] <royalty> i shalt resist temptation
[17:14:35] <robertmaxrees> you always should read it :)
[17:28:31] <esaym> using tablesorter, is there a quick way (or even without table sorter) to fetch a row as json? like {columname1: cellvalue, columname2: cellvaue}..ect
[17:33:59] <robertmaxrees> not that i'm aware of.
[17:43:21] <domino14_> the
[17:43:34] <domino14_> the 'method' arg to $.ajax was just added in 1.9.0 ?? i'm assuming it was called something else before?
[17:44:19] <robertmaxrees> it was type before.
[17:44:19] <domino14_> oh, it was called type
[18:23:41] <bobdobbs> I'd like to watch a part of my DOM for changes, and then respond to changes.
[18:24:07] <bobdobbs> How do I start to think about this problem? How can jQuery methods make this kind of task easier for me?
[18:24:20] <robertmaxrees> you don't want jquery for that tbh.
[18:24:31] <robertmaxrees> could you explain why you want that?
[18:24:56] <bobdobbs> thinking about how to explain concisely
[18:25:12] <robertmaxrees> why not use callbacks or whatever?
[18:25:24] <robertmaxrees> like, why use the DOM to proxy logic like that?
[18:25:28] <bobdobbs> I might as well show the problem directly.
[18:26:12] <bobdobbs> I'm using jquery UI to present a slider: http://staging.defensevids.com/
[18:26:45] <bobdobbs> the context is a bit... hairy. The form is output by a wordpress plugin.
[18:27:03] <bobdobbs> The plugin lets the user page back and forth through different parts of the form.
[18:27:21] <robertmaxrees> so you're using a jqui carousel, yeah?
[18:27:43] <bobdobbs> The thing is, if the user moves forward, and then back to the first position of the form, the slider no longer appears
[18:27:56] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like a bug.
[18:28:01] <bobdobbs> robertmaxrees: not a carousel, no. a slider. like a range slider.
[18:28:10] <robertmaxrees> oooh
[18:28:22] <robertmaxrees> can you replicate the problem in a fiddle?
[18:28:23] <bobdobbs> I don't think think it's a bug. It's that the devs didn't anticipate what I'm doing.
[18:28:44] <robertmaxrees> because moving a slider back to the start shouldn't cause it to no longer appear :)
[18:28:59] <bobdobbs> robertmaxrees: not without a huge amount of labour. But the issue can been directly on the site.
[18:29:05] <bobdobbs> here is what happens...
[18:29:10] <robertmaxrees> so how do i replicate?
[18:29:37] <bobdobbs> robertmaxrees: you can see the issue directly on the site I linked to.
[18:29:45] <robertmaxrees> i don't see a slider.
[18:29:50] <bobdobbs> no?
[18:30:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.  also getting a js error.
[18:30:03] <robertmaxrees> window.addEventListener('resize');
[18:30:07] <robertmaxrees> not enough args toi that.
[18:30:24] <bobdobbs> interesting. I'm not getting that
[18:30:38] <robertmaxrees> comment out that line, either wayt.
[18:30:50] <bobdobbs> can you reload the page now, and tell me what you see under the text input.
[18:31:05] <robertmaxrees> still getting that JS error.
[18:31:06] <bobdobbs> Do you see a slideable UI component?
[18:31:28] <bobdobbs> interesting
[18:31:33] <robertmaxrees> nope, because that js error is still there.
[18:31:51] <bobdobbs> k, one sec
[18:32:28] <bobdobbs> ok. try again now
[18:32:39] <robertmaxrees> same thing.
[18:33:11] <robertmaxrees> http://staging.defensevids.com/wp-content/themes/lightrail/js/lightrail.js?ver=113e3e4c3c473e8b16c815f1cea304d8
[18:33:14] <robertmaxrees> looks like a cachebusting issue?
[18:33:59] <bobdobbs> I've overwritten the js file.
[18:34:16] <robertmaxrees> right, but that version seems specific to a particular cached copy.
[18:35:13] <bobdobbs> I've turned off the caching. try again now
[18:35:25] <robertmaxrees> same error.
[18:35:51] <bobdobbs> can you do a hard reload?
[18:35:57] <robertmaxrees> already did many times.
[18:36:00] <robertmaxrees> tried incog.
[18:36:09] <bobdobbs> incognito mode?
[18:36:33] <robertmaxrees> let me try chrome.
[18:36:40] <robertmaxrees> it's more forgiving with bad js.
[18:37:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah the bad code is still there.
[18:37:14] <robertmaxrees> but chrome doesn't appear to throw an error.  that's scary.
[18:37:36] <bobdobbs> yeah :/
[18:37:43] <robertmaxrees> so fix the error?
[18:37:44] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:37:53] <robertmaxrees> either way, i see the slider now.
[18:38:09] <bobdobbs> I've been just on chrome at this point, so I hadn't seen the error.
[18:38:20] <bobdobbs> thanks for spotting that
[18:38:21] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is when you click "back"?
[18:38:26] <bobdobbs> yeah
[18:38:41] <robertmaxrees> how are you managing that?  where's the ajax call?
[18:39:01] <bobdobbs> it's being done from the wordpress form management plugin.
[18:39:16] <bobdobbs> so I cant/don't want to touch that code
[18:39:18] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* of course it is.
[18:39:28] <robertmaxrees> and they don't expose any way for you to hook in callbacks.
[18:39:47] <bobdobbs> I don't know if they do or not. I've lodged a support request with them.
[18:40:35] <bobdobbs> but in the meantime, I guess that there might be an approach based on watching parts of the DOM andresponding to changes.
[18:40:43] <robertmaxrees> that's still not what you want :)
[18:40:47] <bobdobbs> no?
[18:40:57] <robertmaxrees> those are very slow and inefficient and hard to manage
[18:41:09] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[18:41:13] <robertmaxrees> check these out instead.
[18:41:20] <bobdobbs> I figure something like "if there is a change, and if div#slider can be seen, then do myfunction()"
[18:41:24] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:41:26] <bobdobbs> ok
[18:41:30] <robertmaxrees> use a global ajax event handlker.
[18:41:38] <bobdobbs> k. reading that doc now. thanks.
[18:41:40] <robertmaxrees> watching the dom for changes munges your purpose and they're really inefficient.
[18:41:54] <bobdobbs> yeah?
[18:42:27] <robertmaxrees> si
[18:42:31] <bobdobbs> k :)
[18:43:32] <bobdobbs> huh. ajaxComplete() might be a tool to use in this case.
[18:43:55] <robertmaxrees> you want ajaxSuccess()
[18:43:59] <bobdobbs> ah, ok
[18:44:19] <bobdobbs> well geez. this might be simpler than I thought
[18:44:24] <robertmaxrees> much :)
[18:44:58] <bobdobbs> i had a sneaky feeling that there was an event for after ajax calls
[18:45:08] <bobdobbs> I didn't know what to search for though
[18:45:14] <robertmaxrees> these aren't like real events, but will fit your needs.
[18:45:26] <bobdobbs> what makes them "not real events"?
[18:46:14] <robertmaxrees> oh i guess you can bind to them using .on()
[18:46:14] <robertmaxrees> nv,
[18:46:15] <bobdobbs> geez. I've been javascripting for years and I still feel like a babe in the woods
[18:46:19] <robertmaxrees> *nvm
[18:46:33] <robertmaxrees> lol because you're thinking of it as "javascripting" and not "programming"
[18:47:45] <bobdobbs> hehe
[18:48:20] <bobdobbs> yeah. most of the time I'm doing wee hacks. But occaisonally I have to do actually properly structured code and logic with tests and stuff
[18:48:24] <bobdobbs> just not very often
[18:48:55] <bobdobbs> I think that this was the most complex thing I've done with js: http://mlsmatchmaker.com/tx/
[18:48:58] <bobdobbs> it's very jquery
[18:50:22] <royalty> I'm houston dynamo
[18:50:27] <bobdobbs> heheh
[18:50:35] <royalty> i don't even know what that is, some sort of sports team?
[18:50:50] <bobdobbs> dude, I don't even know. I just coded it.
[18:50:52] <royalty> oh after a bit of reading
[18:50:54] <royalty> soccer
[18:51:12] <royalty> bobdobbs, yeah people in texas probably don't watch much soccer
[18:51:14] <bobdobbs> it was for some US national competition
[18:51:26] <bobdobbs> royalty: I guessed as much
[18:51:59] <royalty> it's funny because the site is pretty much assuming you know nothing about which team to pick
[18:52:02] <royalty> and picking one for you
[18:52:06] <royalty> to get you interested
[18:52:12] <robertmaxrees> decent cobranding idea.
[18:52:45] <royalty> i bet it's really all based on the first question and the others don't weigh in
[18:53:14] <bobdobbs> the result is based on the users total response
[18:53:52] <royalty> really? interesting...
[18:54:02] <bobdobbs> yeah. that logic was pretty simple.
[18:54:15] <bobdobbs> like, every answer biases you towards one team or the other.
[18:54:35] <royalty> i see, the first question is just the only obvious bias
[18:54:44] <royalty> based on how much you know about it i guess
[18:54:46] <robertmaxrees> that's probably the idea.
[18:58:27] <robertmaxrees> it's like those buzzfeed quizzes.
[18:58:49] <bobdobbs> yeah. something like that.
[18:59:00] <bobdobbs> a few seconds of entertainment for the punters
[18:59:15] <bobdobbs> I'm not sure what the commercial value of it was for the upstream client
[18:59:25] <robertmaxrees> gets user engagement on the page.
[18:59:29] <robertmaxrees> makes them feel better.
[18:59:48] <bobdobbs> It was soooo much work. more than I had anticipated
[18:59:53] <bobdobbs> twas fun though
[19:00:09] <bobdobbs> and there was a moment or two when I actually felt like a programmer
[19:00:16] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[19:00:31] <royalty> lolll
[19:05:54] <printForever> need help with this https://jsfiddle.net/LaLb4gys/4/
[19:06:00] <printForever> :(
[19:06:40] <robertmaxrees> console mano.
[19:06:50] <printForever> huh?
[19:06:54] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[19:07:10] <printForever> SyntaxError: missing ; before statement
[19:07:32] <printForever> but but...
[19:07:38] <printForever> the example...
[19:07:48] <robertmaxrees> what example?
[19:08:01] <royalty> LOOK AT THAT EXAMPLE GOOD AND HARD
[19:08:04] <royalty> GOOD AND HARD
[19:08:05] <printForever> if I put ; before the statement, than it wont work
[19:08:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:09:22] <printForever> I dont get it
[19:09:28] <robertmaxrees> what did you do to fix it?
[19:09:33] <robertmaxrees> and where did you get this example from?
[19:09:34] <printForever> nothing
[19:09:37] <printForever> ah...
[19:09:42] <printForever> https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/3354
[19:10:13] <robertmaxrees> i don't see that code on that page.
[19:10:21] <printForever> its mixed
[19:10:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:10:49] <printForever> taplar wrote the second part
[19:10:58] <robertmaxrees> Search.prototype.searchRemoveChoice = function() { this?
[19:11:19] <printForever> taplar wrote this > var CustomAdapter = Utils.Decorate; {
[19:11:26] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:11:28] <printForever> the code from the link is search.prototype...
[19:11:38] <robertmaxrees> sooo....
[19:11:49] <printForever> the code taplar wrote is to enable inputing whatever text, and turning it into a tag
[19:12:00] <printForever> which works fine
[19:12:22] <robertmaxrees> you're getting a js error there so it's not going to function.
[19:12:24] <printForever> but I can't incorporate this "patch", as Select2 guys call it, into taplars code
[19:12:27] <robertmaxrees> not sure what else to tell you.
[19:12:36] <printForever> where to put the ;
[19:12:44] <printForever> because I see everything balanced
[19:12:51] <robertmaxrees> var CustomAdapter = Utils.Decorate {} isn't a thing.
[19:13:00] <printForever> it's not?
[19:13:02] <printForever> then, what is it?
[19:13:09] <robertmaxrees> ...
[19:13:14] <robertmaxrees> "it's not a thing"
[19:13:44] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/017a25261593
[19:13:48] <robertmaxrees> is this maybe what you meant?
[19:14:14] <printForever> that doesent work too
[19:14:22] <robertmaxrees> define "doesn't work"?
[19:14:30] <printForever> look at the output
[19:14:34] <printForever> Selec2 is not loading
[19:14:34] <robertmaxrees> because you're just slinging around code and pasting it and expecting it to function.
[19:14:53] <robertmaxrees> i'm showing you what i think the syntax error was duder.
[19:14:56] <printForever> I'm trying to figure out what goes where...
[19:15:20] <robertmaxrees> you realize $('#testingSelect2').select2({ can't be in the require call, right?
[19:15:37] <printForever> its in the example
[19:15:38] <printForever> and it works
[19:15:44] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/zmh90ewu/
[19:15:48] <printForever> how does that work?
[19:15:48] <robertmaxrees> then you're not having an issue.
[19:15:49] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[19:16:02] <printForever> -_-
[19:16:03] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[19:16:05] <robertmaxrees> yeesh
[19:16:09] <robertmaxrees> all errors are in there.
[19:16:19] <printForever> its open... the error doesnt make sens to me
[19:16:23] <printForever> :(
[19:16:34] <printForever> I'm looking at the code and all braces are balanced
[19:16:40] <robertmaxrees> this is not a brace issue.
[19:16:45] <printForever> oh
[19:17:09] <royalty> it's the difference between a prototype method and an object
[19:17:23] <printForever> ok, I'm listening
[19:18:17] <printForever> omg
[19:18:22] <printForever> I screwed up the code...
[19:18:25] <royalty> if you set a var to something you most likely want to be calling a method var x = whatever.Dude(); a method that takes parameters
[19:18:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:18:39] <printForever> and its still not working...
[19:18:43] <royalty> but you could set it to an object as well
[19:19:09] <royalty> var whatTheHeckMang = {};
[19:19:14] <royalty> that is an empty object
[19:19:46] <royalty> you can't do whatever.Whenever{ weneedtobetogether};
[19:19:49] <royalty> it makes 0 sense
[19:19:59] <printForever> :))))
[19:20:04] <printForever> it makes sense to Select2
[19:20:09] <printForever> so, I will explain
[19:20:13] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/LaLb4gys/12/
[19:20:33] <robertmaxrees> "undefined missing select2/dropdown/attachContainer" there's yoru error with that one.
[19:20:48] <printForever> from line 6 to 11th line its the code that is erasing tags everyt time you press backspace
[19:21:25] <royalty> printForever, i was still right, the difference is between a () and {}|
[19:21:27] <royalty> {}
[19:21:40] <robertmaxrees> can you even use require like that in a fiddle?
[19:22:34] <royalty> illBeThere.andYoullBeNear.andThatsTheDeal.myDear();
[19:22:38] <robertmaxrees> isn't that tryign to actually load files from the server?
[19:23:01] <printForever> :/
[19:23:06] <printForever> I'm confused
[19:23:20] <royalty> just relax and listen to some shakira man
[19:23:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:23:29] <royalty> nevermind
[19:23:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:23:34] <printForever> not helping
[19:23:34] <royalty> disregard my advice
[19:23:35] <robertmaxrees> not really being helpful :)
[19:27:12] <printForever> ok, starting over https://jsfiddle.net/LaLb4gys/19/
[19:27:39] <royalty> printForever, it works, awww yeeeee
[19:27:53] <printForever> I just reverted back to ver 0
[19:28:08] <royalty> oh ok
[19:28:36] <robertmaxrees> so what are you trying to do?
[19:29:01] <printForever> I would like to add an option (which taplar wrote for me before) to add any text as a tag, and not just the one in the list.
[19:29:10] <robertmaxrees> okay.  then integrate that code.
[19:29:24] <printForever> For example, if I type "something" and press enter, it should create a tag.
[19:29:30] <printForever> OK.
[19:29:52] <printForever> In order to do that, I need to add Select2 options.
[19:29:58] <printForever> I think...
[19:30:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:30:03] <printForever> because thats how taplar did it
[19:30:15] <printForever> like... I'm just trying to wrap my head around what he did
[19:30:29] <robertmaxrees> so maybe you should back way up and spend time figuring that our first?
[19:30:43] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to expand on what he did?
[19:30:44] <b1101> what's the best way for me to monitor over 40 checkboxes, and when one of them is change in any way send the values of all of them to php ?
[19:30:57] <robertmaxrees> b1101 a delegated event listener.
[19:31:17] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events for more info.
[19:31:28] <printForever> so Select2 guys used 'select2/selection/search' and Taplar used "select2/dropdown/search"
[19:31:35] <printForever> why is there a difference between those two?
[19:31:42] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what require.js does?
[19:32:14] <printForever> no idea
[19:32:18] <b1101> robertmaxrees: thx. Google did not get me this result :P
[19:32:24] <robertmaxrees> printForever requirejs.org/docs/api.html
[19:33:14] <printForever> can you explain this to me, please?
[19:33:24] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:33:29] <robertmaxrees> read the docs mang.
[19:33:41] <printForever> I'm reading but I dont understand what I'm reading
[19:33:54] <robertmaxrees> so require loads js files and modules.
[19:33:55] <b1101> my problem is always getting the right doc for what it is I want to do
[19:34:03] <printForever> I understand that I'm including "something" in Select2 but I have no idea what
[19:34:07] <printForever> nor how
[19:34:19] <robertmaxrees> b1101 check out learn.jquery.com - it's a good primer to understand that sort of stuff.
[19:34:28] <robertmaxrees> printForever that's why you need to read the require docs :)
[19:34:41] <printForever> its 1:34 in the morning
[19:34:47] <printForever> I've been working for 10h
[19:34:48] <printForever> ...
[19:34:50] <robertmaxrees> then take a break.
[19:34:55] <printForever> I cant...
[19:34:57] <robertmaxrees> or go to a channel for require support.
[19:35:13] <printForever> channel for what?
[19:35:17] <robertmaxrees> require.js
[19:35:48] <printForever> robertmaxrees, I get that I need to cover the bases, but that is not even 1/10th of the issue. And I need to spend 1-2h to get it.
[19:36:03] <printForever> If you can point me to an answer or where to look, that would be great...
[19:36:07] <robertmaxrees> the docs.
[19:36:13] <printForever> Not Require.js
[19:36:18] <robertmaxrees> like, part of your issue is you don't know how require works.
[19:36:18] <printForever> the fiddle
[19:36:24] <printForever> I agree
[19:36:26] <robertmaxrees> which is a big part of understanding what taplar did.
[19:36:26] <printForever> and I know
[19:36:31] <printForever> but I have a WORKING example
[19:36:39] <printForever> I just need to mash it together with their "patch"
[19:36:41] <printForever> to have this done
[19:36:42] <robertmaxrees> obviously it's not if you're trying to do something else with it.
[19:36:43] <printForever> and move on
[19:37:04] <printForever> taplar???? WHERE ARE YOU? :(
[19:37:41] <arc_> just getting somebody to fix your problem when you don't understand what's wrong or how to fix it yourself, is a recipe for future disaster
[19:37:51] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[19:38:31] <printForever> and when disaster is here... I'm asking for some direction on how to correct this
[19:38:46] <printForever> I understand parts, basic parts of it, but I don't get how it actually works
[19:38:55] <robertmaxrees> right.  so that's why you educate yourself.
[19:38:57] <printForever> I've read Select2 documentation
[19:39:22] <printForever> Utils is part of their core, but there aren't any examples, like taplar did
[19:39:28] <robertmaxrees> so are you expecting one of us to show you how to fix this?
[19:39:57] <robertmaxrees> the entire reason we don't just hand over solutions like that normally is because that helps avoid problems like what you've got now :)
[19:41:40] <printForever> if I'm rude, excuse me, but I don't come to the channel to brag when I write something that works. So if the pattern is that people come here when they need help, yes, thats absolutely true.
[19:42:18] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:42:22] <royalty> all he wants you to do is know a bit more about the components you are using in your code
[19:42:25] <royalty> ie require js
[19:42:30] <robertmaxrees> you're blowing this out of proportion.
[19:43:01] <printForever> royalty, its been 10h work day, and I really dont want to know anything else except if I'm going to finish this in 5 minutes or 2 hours so I can go to sleep.
[19:43:04] <royalty> you also need to understand how jsfiddle works, you have some idea since you included external resources
[19:43:36] <printForever> I've tried to fix this on my local example and on fiddle and both failed. I didn't know what to do so I came here, as before.
[19:44:18] <robertmaxrees> so what do you want us to do?
[19:44:31] <royalty> give him the solution so he can sleep, lol
[19:44:47] <printForever> no, I will continue with trial and error until I get it
[19:44:56] <robertmaxrees> you currently have a question about require.  so it sounds like you need to learn enough about require to understand its role.
[19:45:03] <printForever> thanks robertmaxrees, if I had time I would probably read the docs.
[19:45:19] <robertmaxrees> there's no need to be rude to me, mano.
[19:45:30] <printForever> No, I have a question about why the code is not working and why is it throwing "missing ;" when all braces were balanced
[19:45:52] <robertmaxrees> printForever you realize that braces are only part of the story for that error, right?
[19:45:59] <printForever> but then we reverted back... "well, to solve this, you need to learn the alphabet first..."
[19:46:01] <robertmaxrees> i even fixed that for you and sent you the fixed version.
[19:46:11] <robertmaxrees> and you didn't even thank me ;)
[19:46:14] <printForever> thank you
[19:46:16] <printForever> it didnt work
[19:46:21] <royalty> LMAO
[19:46:28] <robertmaxrees> actually it did.  it fixed that error.
[19:46:31] <robertmaxrees> now you have other errors.
[19:46:31] <printForever> it threw another error
[19:46:38] <printForever> -_-
[19:46:40] <robertmaxrees> yep.  so now you get to learn about why.
[19:47:13] <printForever> no idea
[19:47:24] <printForever> I've included what it required
[19:47:34] <printForever> there is no error explanation
[19:47:38] <robertmaxrees> I'm sorry that you've had such a long day. that sounds really stressful. sounds like maybe you need to learn a bit about require and maybe google the error message you're getting.
[19:47:53] <printForever> thanks robertmaxrees
[19:48:20] <robertmaxrees> we'll be here to provide guidance and support for jquery :)
[19:48:33] <printForever> thanks robertmaxrees
[19:54:40] <printForever> robertmaxrees, just an update, you're code wasn't good https://bpaste.net/show/017a25261593
[19:54:53] <printForever> because you omited parts of it that were required
[19:54:58] <robertmaxrees> it is syntactically sound fwiw.
[19:55:04] <printForever> so by "fixing" an error, you didn't do anything...
[19:55:12] <robertmaxrees> that was the point.  i was fixing the decorator portion.
[19:55:13] <printForever> but, again, thnaks
[19:55:29] <printForever> you might thought you were fixing it, but no
[19:55:43] <robertmaxrees> i fixed the syntax error.
[19:55:44] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[19:55:46] <robertmaxrees> enjoy :)
[19:56:09] <printForever> there wasn't a syntax error related to what you think it was the error
[19:56:20] <robertmaxrees> there was still a syntax error.
[19:56:23] <printForever> the syntax error was in relation to...
[19:56:33] <robertmaxrees> and you're not going to get very far if your code is that broken.
[19:56:35] <printForever> well ok... you have your opinion and thats fine
[19:56:41] <robertmaxrees> that's literal fact.
[19:56:43] <printForever> its taplars code
[19:56:46] <printForever> :)
[19:56:48] <robertmaxrees> it's why you were getting a semicolon error.
[19:57:03] <printForever> as I said, it works fine what taplar wrote
[19:57:21] <robertmaxrees> did you have a question?
[19:57:22] <printForever> and it looks and works as its intended
[19:58:16] <printForever> no, just wanted to let you know that your sytax fix was not the cause of the problem and there wasn't anything to be fixed in that particular syntax (since you've said I haven't thanked you)
[19:58:19] <robertmaxrees> the first fiddle you posted had a syntax error in it :) i simply corrected the syntax error.
[19:58:45] <robertmaxrees> that was all i meant to do.  i didn't intend to fix everything for you.
[19:59:02] <printForever> ok
[19:59:25] <printForever> me pointing out that what you've fixed, actually works (and worked before) is useless
[19:59:43] <robertmaxrees> i already asked.  please show a little more respect to me and other users :)
[20:00:19] <printForever> I believe my demeanor is very cordial, sorry if you feel offended
[20:00:50] * royalty enjoys popcorn
[20:00:57] <robertmaxrees> it obviously has not been.  i pmed you about this already.  you've been rude.  if you'd like to discuss further, feel free to.  otherwise, let's try to have a more effective conversation :)
[20:00:59] <robertmaxrees> thanks!
[20:01:59] <printForever> no, thank you robertmaxrees!
[20:07:58] <SmashingX> Does anybody know where can I get the code for this listview formatting? http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/docs/lists/lists-formatting.html
[20:08:48] <robertmaxrees> the page source.
[20:08:58] <robertmaxrees> also: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.2.1/docs/lists/docs-lists.html
[20:09:19] <robertmaxrees> and the other docs links in there :)
[20:15:27] <SmashingX> robertmaxrees: but the source doesn't tell you the css
[20:15:38] <ThomQ> Hi all. Jquery n00b here, (most experience is in C#, Java, etc). I´m working on a little script that has to get triggered whenever a certain txt file is changed. To do this ATM im just checking the file at a 2 second interval.
[20:15:54] <ThomQ> Obviously I can miss valuable input, is there a better way to check the file for any changes?
[20:16:05] <ThomQ> other then doing it every 0.1 ms for example :d
[20:16:23] <arc_> how is it being modified
[20:16:42] <arc_> oh is this like for a twitch music player or something
[20:16:44] <ThomQ> it contains a string which is added by another program
[20:16:57] <ThomQ> yeah, twitch alert system
[20:17:12] <ThomQ> good guess :D
[20:18:01] <arc_> yeah i'm not positive but if i had to guess i would say there is no way to trigger something to happen in jquery at the moment a text file is updated
[20:18:06] <taplar> ThomQ: what backend platforms do you have available?
[20:18:20] <arc_> that would be something you would do in python or something like that
[20:18:33] <ThomQ> taplar: pretty much everything, im running everything locally
[20:19:08] <taplar> then take a look at doing websockets with nodejs or another language that supports them
[20:19:34] <arc_> C# should be able to do that too, since you say you're experienced with it
[20:20:12] <taplar> the backend would then be checking when the file changes and when it does push a message to the listening users
[20:20:48] <ThomQ> yeah I could use websockets, but I´d like to keep the implementation simplest. It´s not that vital that it´s instantly, was mainly wondering
[20:21:13] <ThomQ> there is also just the twitch API i could use
[20:21:46] <arc_> what is the information that is being put into the text file, donations?
[20:21:51] <taplar> polling will work, though use setTimeout instead of setInterval
[20:21:51] <ThomQ> I´ll figure something out, for now iĺl just use a half second interval, should be good enough for building out the system
[20:22:02] <ThomQ> arc yeah donations and subs
[20:22:20] <arc_> how are they being outputted to a text file/
[20:22:25] <ThomQ> big difference between anything available and what im making: transparent videos
[20:22:38] <ThomQ> Through the twitchalerts app
[20:22:54] <ThomQ> it outputs a bunch of txt files, which you can use as sources
[20:23:06] <ThomQ> the thing itself uses the Twitch API as well ofcourse
[20:24:53] <arc_> where is this script running that you're using jquery
[20:25:03] <arc_> does it run in a window where you have your own stream open?
[20:26:00] <arc_> because i mean .. you could just parse the chat
[20:28:11] <ThomQ> arc-, im using a CLR browser plugin, which basicly just displays a transparent website.
[20:28:28] <ThomQ> Twitch alerts uses it to display gifs and a sound, my local php file plays transparent WebM movies
[20:28:44] <arc_> oh, so you overlay that onto your stream
[20:29:42] <ThomQ> yeah exactly
[20:30:00] <arc_> yeah idk i think parsing chat is probably the easiest way to go about it
[20:30:00] <ThomQ> OBS is pretty rough to write plugins for, so this was by far the easiest way
[20:30:32] <ThomQ> For subs and resubs yeah, but donations dont show up in chat
[20:30:42] <arc_> oh i thought they did
[20:31:12] <arc_> maybe you could parse your email for messages from paypal :p
[20:31:26] <ThomQ> :D hehe
[20:32:15] <ThomQ> i´ll figure something out. Im doing everything  through twitchalerst now anyways, I pretty much just gotta get Their intervals, and make sure my script checks in a somewhat shorter interval to be sure to get everything
[20:32:54] <ThomQ> I could also compare recent_donations.txt to daily_donations.txt to see if it missed anything
[21:29:07] <SmashingX> hey guys how can I make this item to link to another page: https://jsfiddle.net/gq1ebsp7/8/
[21:29:27] <SmashingX> can I use href inside of the li?
[22:34:58] <lonequid> How can I modify this function to work with inputs which are created dynamically? https://jsfiddle.net/2pt70pyg/
[22:35:24] <lonequid> my script adds new inputs as the user interacts, but this function seems to only be checking the inputs that exist the first time it is called
[22:35:38] <lonequid> For events I get around that by using .on and attaching it to $(document), but not sure how to modify this function
[22:35:53] <arc_> lonequid delegated event listeners
[22:36:04] <arc_> https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[22:36:24] <arc_> sorry i didn't fully read what you said heh
[22:36:39] <arc_> but uhh ... attaching to document is not necessarily the best idea
[22:36:57] <lonequid> $(document).on('change', '.order-item-input', function () {
[22:36:59] <arc_> the function should work on the current dom at the time the function is run
[22:37:04] <lonequid> that's how I do it for events
[22:37:10] <lonequid> I guess I should attach that to the parent element
[22:37:22] <arc_> that's the general practice, yes
[22:37:28] <lonequid> but this function I'm using for duplicates doesn't have an event, it's just an .each that's not finding the new elements
[22:37:39] <arc_> when does it run
[22:38:16] <lonequid> it's called in the .on('change'
[22:39:25] <lonequid> https://jsfiddle.net/2pt70pyg/1/ more context
[22:40:32] <arc_> if you trigger this multiple times, is it always only missing one element
[22:41:06] <arc_> the most recent element
[22:41:12] <lonequid> hmm, it doesn't seem to be working properly
[22:41:40] <arc_> idk though, you're calling it after you add the element. it should work
[22:41:47] <lonequid> maybe my inputsHaveDuplicatevalues function is bad
[22:42:03] <arc_> you said it works normally, yes?
[22:42:12] <arc_> reading it, it doesn't seem like it would
[22:42:17] <lonequid> that function? no, i grabbed it off github
[22:42:23] <arc_> oh
[22:42:30] <lonequid> i'll try writing my own I guess
[22:42:45] <arc_> i don't get this use of the variable
[22:43:06] <arc_> why doesn't it just do if ($inputsWithSameValue.length > 1) { return true; }
[22:43:24] <lonequid> yeah that seemed weird to me too
[22:46:41] <lonequid> that variable always has a length of 0
[22:47:08] <lonequid> I think I remember reading something that css selectors like that won't update for added elements
[22:48:16] <arc_> your input has no value
[22:49:00] <arc_> i don't see where you're assigning the id to the value
[22:49:26] <lonequid> if I change it to var $inputsWithSameValue = $('input[value=' + $(this).val() + ']');     alert($inputsWithSameValue.length);
[22:49:35] <lonequid> I get an alert of 0 for each input
[22:49:39] <lonequid> it should be at least 1
[22:49:59] <arc_> you don't need .length in the alert because you want the value of the variable
[22:50:17] <arc_> also you should use console.log instead of alerts
[22:52:35] <lonequid> oh I'm getting
[22:52:42] <lonequid> Uncaught Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: input[value=]
[22:52:47] <lonequid> it's not populating out into the selector properly
[22:52:55] <lonequid> oh I know what's happening
[22:53:41] <lonequid> that error was from the empty textbox
[22:53:59] <arc_> that's what i was saying, your inputs have no value
[22:54:46] <lonequid> but they do
[22:55:19] <lonequid> $(this).val() has a value, so the selector should evaluate to $('input[value=test]') for instance
[22:57:43] <arc_> ok. then $(this) isn't what you think it is inside the function
[22:58:02] <arc_> inside the function change $(this) to event
[22:58:22] <arc_> event.target
[22:58:28] <lonequid> but if i console.log($(this).val()) I get what I expect
[22:58:44] <arc_> wtfz
[22:58:57] <lonequid>   		console.log('input[value=' + $(this).val() + ']');
[22:59:07] <lonequid> input[value=test]
[22:59:19] <arc_> it has to be value="test"
[22:59:30] <lonequid> not filled in as test
[23:00:10] <arc_> idk what that means. i'm saying it has to have quotes
[23:03:08] <lonequid> doesn't fix it
[23:06:03] <lonequid> it's gotta be that selector, even if I abstract it out from the function it's always empty
[23:08:10] <printForever> shoky, just wanted to say thank you, again
[23:08:44] <lonequid> using :contains() doesn't work either
[23:08:45] <printForever> I went back for months to search through the logs, and your idea helped me solve one big/small issue
[23:45:01] <lonequid> well I got it to work but not using that same method arc_
[23:45:52] <printForever> in the end, almost 4 hours later I've finished what I wanted
