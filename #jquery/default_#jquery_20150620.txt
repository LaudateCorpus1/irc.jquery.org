[04:11:17] <benbro1> how do I get a reference to a plugin instance?
[04:11:28] <benbro1> for example, if I have: var table = $('#example').DataTable();
[04:11:42] <benbro1> how can I get the table later from $('#example')?
[04:35:40] <MrFeedback> hey guys. a short question when i have jQuery('selector').on('click' and I want to trigger that too when it gets the event "tap" how do i setup this?
[04:35:51] <MrFeedback> i mean either click or tap
[04:55:56] <monk3y> MrFeedback: um; https://api.jquerymobile.com/tap/ ?  Then have both call the same function to do stuff?
[05:22:57] <_1009> o/
[05:28:03] <_1009> my jquery mobile range slider doesn't fire a change event when the lower bound is approaching the upper bound (i.e. min=1, max=5, lower=4, upper=5 to lower=5, upper=5). This is my doing, as an isolated example in a jsbin is performing just fine. Are there any common causes for this? Does setting CSS margins etc. affect performance here?
[05:29:26] <_1009> Wait, actually, I am able to replicate this in a jsbin.
[05:30:09] <_1009> http://jsbin.com/fajudodevi/edit?html,js,console,output - drag min to 5: no change event is fired.

[07:57:21] <jakemichaeldrew> hi
[08:55:33] <Razerglass> is there a way to go back to 'original' css?
[08:55:50] <Razerglass> like if i changed a back ground color, and want to 'undo' it
[08:58:56] <_1009> Razerglass: save it elsewhere, for example in a .data attribute -- https://api.jquery.com/jquery.data/
[09:00:53] <Razerglass> do i need to save the 'original' css or the 'temporary' css?
[09:01:25] <_1009> The original css, as that is the css you want to retrieve later on. The temporary css is saved on the html attribute anyway when applied.
[09:02:00] <Razerglass> so theres no easy way to use the css that is there on load after it is changed? ill need another class to change it too?
[09:05:11] <_1009> Partly right. It depends on whether there's a class that you're attaching or just CSS attributes you're overriding.
[09:06:24] <_1009> For example, if you have a <div class="cool-div"></div> where in a stylesheet you have .cool-div { background-color: red; }, you could runtime to $(".cool-div").css("background-color", "blue"); and later $(".cool-div").css("background-color", "initial"); to undo this.
[09:06:44] <_1009> On the other hand, that is not really feasible when you have <div style="background-color: red;"></div>
[09:21:24] <ffffionn> hey guys, i am trying to make a whole table row a clickable link, but wrapping it in <a> tag dont work

[11:15:29] <R13ose> How come in this code: http://pastebin.com/S2VvDtyv I get an error in console that says "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'entry' of undefined" on line 84?
[11:19:50] <rcyr> feed is probably undefined.
[12:09:39] <rand0m> hello all!
[12:10:03] <rand0m> im trying to do a simple animation in jquery, can I have some assistance ?
[12:10:11] <rand0m> here is the code im working on : http://jsfiddle.net/fatgamer85/m71osbLt/2/
[12:11:04] <rand0m> what im achieving to do is to roll the divs to show its content
[12:11:15] <rand0m> but I don't know what I am doing wrong
[12:11:33] <R13ose> hi
[12:11:42] <rand0m> hi
[12:13:32] <rand0m> I'm pretty close now: http://jsfiddle.net/fatgamer85/m71osbLt/3/
[12:14:10] <rand0m> my block rotates upwards, but it returns to original position before it rotates again, and I want to stop that behavior
[12:14:38] <rand0m> anyone ?
[12:14:56] <R13ose> Code: http://pastebin.com/x9kNb3C3 I am trying to get one of my youtube playlist titles but in the console I get this: "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'title' of undefined" on line 14.  Any ideas?
[12:16:08] <rand0m> R13ose, can you build a working example on jsfiddle.com or plnkr.co
[12:17:52] <R13ose> rand0m: yes but this shows up blank, do you still want to see this?  I don't this on the live site.
[12:18:27] <rand0m> yes
[12:18:30] <rand0m> please
[12:18:51] <rand0m> you could always console log the data to see what's actually being recieved
[12:20:26] <R13ose> rand0m: I did that and still didn't understand what I was doing wrong.
[12:20:33] <R13ose> rand0m: can I pm you the url?
[12:20:37] <rand0m> sure
[12:21:32] <R13ose> rand0m: the blank white part on the right side is where I am trying to load this.  This was using in v2 but not in v3.
[12:23:36] <rand0m> hmm strange
[12:27:06] <rand0m> test
[12:30:15] <alaing> good evening all!
[12:33:21] <alaing> show me your jquery! :-) any issues out there?
[12:34:11] <R13ose> alaing: who?
[12:34:44] <rand0m> yes alaing
[12:34:56] <alaing> R13ose: no one in particular....just want to help anyone whose got jquery questions
[12:35:02] <R13ose> okay
[12:35:13] <alaing> rand0m: whats up?
[12:35:14] <rand0m> copy paste from earlier:  im trying to do a simple animation in jquery, what im achieving to do is to roll the divs to show its content
[12:35:33] <rand0m> my block rotates upwards, but it returns to original position before it rotates again, and I want to stop that behavior and here's my code http://jsfiddle.net/fatgamer85/m71osbLt/3/
[12:35:54] <alaing> rand0m: excellent let me take a look
[12:37:02] <alaing> rand0m: I think I've seen something like this done with css animations
[12:38:40] <rand0m> yeah tympanus did the buttons
[12:39:04] <rand0m> but I want to have say, 5 divs with different texts
[12:39:14] <rand0m> and then roll from div 1 to 5 and stop at 5th
[12:39:31] <alaing> rand0m: i gotcha
[12:39:43] <alaing> rand0m: I think you need to use deferred
[12:39:50] <alaing> instead of settimeouts
[12:40:19] <rand0m> https://youtu.be/pQrxfBOo_Mo?t=24s < here
[12:40:24] <rand0m> watch that video ^
[12:40:30] <rand0m> im trying to something like that
[12:41:01] <rand0m> instead of the blue text changing, Im going to wrap it into a div and rotate it
[12:41:34] <alaing> oh ok
[12:42:53] <alaing> rand0m: let me try a few things
[12:43:11] <alaing> i see the problem like panel 2 showing twice before movign to 3
[12:45:26] <Pazician> Hola, everyone. I've an Ajax chat, and now I want to do a sound or just change the title when there's a new message popping up in the chat. How can I do that with jQuery?
[12:48:36] <alaing> rand0m: take a look at Paul Irish video https://vimeo.com/12529436 skip to around 7:45
[12:49:02] <alaing> its kind of the problem you having
[12:49:17] <alaing> where the setTimeout arent running in sync
[12:52:26] <alaing> rand0m: I suppose you could also do it using events
[12:52:34] <alaing> and trigger off custom events
[12:52:56] <alaing> so you have a listener attached to the parent
[12:53:52] <Technodrome> when doing a mouse enter and leave, why am I having a flickering issue?
[12:54:19] <rand0m> alaing, the anonymous wrapper won't do any help for me Im guessing
[12:54:49] <rand0m> technodrome, do you have an example ?
[12:54:53] <alaing> and then when the animation is finished you trigger an event that the parent element listens for
[12:55:08] <rand0m> I think
[12:55:10] <rand0m> I THINK
[12:55:16] <rand0m> that the browser is the culprit here
[12:55:25] <rand0m> when I remove the class, its reverting back the original position
[12:56:24] <R13ose> rand0m: tried different browsers?
[13:00:29] <toothe> I have a class whose value is "implemented_345-id". Is there a way to just extract the value 345 from that?
[13:00:41] <toothe> I'm assuming some kind of regular expression?
[13:02:10] <R13ose> var suffix = 'implemented_345-id'.match(/\d+/);
[13:02:24] * toothe tries.
[13:02:47] <DaFiN> hey i am looking for some very good websites created with jquery
[13:02:55] <DaFiN> do not know if this is right question?
[13:02:56] <toothe> wow, that worked.
[13:03:08] <alaing> rand0m: still working on something
[13:03:10] <DaFiN> but, if somebody could respond i would be very happy
[13:05:23] <DaFiN> i want to create some different website, something different from standard templates.
[13:05:36] <DaFiN> hence, i am looking for more ideas, at more websites
[13:06:37] <PCatinean> hey guys, if I have 30-40 images and I have a select field that loads a separate image depending on what's picked (lazy loading)
[13:06:45] <PCatinean> how do I fadeout the current image while fading in the new one?
[13:10:32] <rand0m> @PCatinean did you use css3
[13:16:12] <PCatinean> rand0m, did not
[13:16:42] <rand0m> how are you fading the image then?
[13:17:47] <toothe> how do I get a <SPAN>
[13:17:48] <toothe> err
[13:17:53] <toothe> How do I get a <span>'s value?
[13:19:36] <arc_> what do you mean by value
[13:20:11] <arc_> value property is only for input objects afaik
[13:21:56] <arc_> if you want the inner html, it's just $('yourspanselector').html()
[13:24:11] <alaing> yes arc_
[13:24:47] <alaing> if you need to escape the text you can use .text()
[13:25:44] <rand0m> @toothe $("span").text() ?
[13:29:53] <alaing> sorry rand0m I need to go
[13:30:32] <Pazician_> Hola, why does my "onfocus" work? https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a9ea36f92528e50e5ca7
[13:30:41] <Pazician_> Does not'
[13:31:25] <alaing> rand0m: http://jsfiddle.net/d2mjofqh/1/
[13:33:09] <alaing> rand0m: not queit working
[13:33:19] <alaing> rand0m: but I need to head off
[13:33:24] <alaing> sorry :-(
[13:34:27] <alaing> Pazician_: try create an example on jsfiddle.net
[13:34:42] <alaing> good night all
[13:36:33] <kakashiAL> is there a way to do something like $(this > td > bold)
[13:37:01] <tw2113> $(this + '> td > bold') may work
[13:37:11] <tw2113> i won't guarantee
[13:37:14] <arc_> i think you would have to use .find()
[13:37:31] <tw2113> that was my next suggestion
[13:37:42] <tw2113> $(this).find('expression')
[13:38:32] <kakashiAL> ahh, I guess I found a solution, have to test it
[13:38:50] <kakashiAL> $(> td > bold, this))
[13:39:27] <arc_> where did you find that
[13:39:30] <arc_> i don't think that works
[13:41:34] <kakashiAL> arc_: stackoverflow
[13:43:41] <arc_> why can't you just do $(this).find('td > bold')
[13:45:09] <kakashiAL> arc_: too verboose, but if the stackoverflow method doesnt work, I will try this
[13:45:20] <arc_> o_O
[13:46:48] <arc_> the thing you pasted gives 'unexpected token'
[13:46:59] <arc_> $(this, '> td > bold') <- that returns something, but not what you want
[13:47:31] <arc_> really just returns $(this)
[13:47:35] <kakashiAL> arc_: did you try $('td > bold', this) ?
[13:47:38] <arc_> yes
[13:48:24] <arc_> actually no, i didn't remove the first >
[13:48:24] <arc_> that works
[14:06:01] <kakashiAL> arc_: $('strong > a', this).html()  is working :)
[14:43:08] <Mooniac> what's a good IDE for jQuery UI?
[14:44:21] <R-Ratones> most IDE and editors nowaways have great support for javascript and javascript frameworks
[14:45:02] <tw2113> i'd also be surprised if any were built specifically for jQuery UI
[14:58:08] <joe9___> hello, I am trying to simulate a button click on a web page. The button click sends a GET request. I am testing this using the Firebug console.
[14:58:21] <joe9___> http://codepad.org/rG1Tn7Op is the script.
[14:58:52] <joe9___> It runs fine the first time I run it. But, the next time I run it, it just returns an Object in the Firebug console.
[14:58:55] <joe9___> Does that make sense?
[14:59:09] <joe9___> Do I have to do some other initialization after each click simulated?
[15:05:08] <shoky> joe9___: that's not code
[15:05:35] <arc_> lol
[15:06:20] <arc_> if only it were that easy
[15:08:09] <joe9___> shoky: sorry, mistake. just screwed up the paste buffers.
[15:08:33] <joe9___> shoky, figured it out. the include ("jquery") was causing the issue.
[15:22:40] <joe9___> use greasemonkey and jquery, I want to simulate a click action on an object. The click action cause a GET request to fire. I want to check if the GET status returned SUCCESS or failed. Any suggestions on how I can check the status of the click action's get request?
[15:22:57] <joe9___> please.
[17:15:30] <d[10]> hello my friends..
[18:03:19] <kakashiAL> is there a way to tell attr() to take more than one attribute?
[18:07:01] <shoky> when setting attributes, sure
[19:57:41] <drummachine> hi everyone
[19:57:59] <drummachine> i had a quick question
[19:58:39] <drummachine> I have an app that I built using jquery. i deployed it using heroku and for some reason the performance of my app sucks once it has deployed.
[19:59:03] <drummachine> its a simple drum machine and I am using setInterval for the steps/beats
[19:59:23] <drummachine> after deployment it seems to stutter a bunch
[20:01:24] <Robdgreat_> what's your question?
[20:03:54] <SteenJobs> i’m creating drag and drop functionality for my app and i only want handles to appear around the image on the canvas that’s selected - i managed to get it working except for one thing - if someone selects one image and then a second image, they’ll both be selected - only if there’s a $(document).click will the image handles disappear. how can i fix this?
[20:04:14] <drummachine> why would the performance between my development and production environments differ?
[21:18:20] <bros> How bad is binding a ton of events to $(document)?
[21:18:27] <bros> I'm seeing 300ms events on an iPod touch.
[21:18:34] <bros> That are 5ms on a desktop in Chrome.
[21:18:51] <arc_> 5ms is pretty long tbh
[21:19:12] <bros> Should I do it to body instead? I don't see an easy solution.
[21:19:19] <bros> I have like, a 30k line codebase of $(document) events
[21:19:22] <arc_> depends what the event is
[21:20:36] <bros> a click or a keypress
[22:02:19] <SteenJobs> can anyone venture a guess why $(document).click would stop working after dragging a draggable to a droppable?
[22:10:25] <joe9> I am trying to figure out how I can reliably select an item: <td id="yui_3_3_0_2_143486294322814335" class="ssc-wla" rel="main"> . The id keeps changing. Any suggestions, please? Should I try to use the parent element and build the heirarchy? or, can I sue the attribute rel="main"?
[22:13:01] <joe9> got it, .class[attribute...]
[23:05:33] <jak2000> ajax question: if i use POST method, how to send 4 variables(parameters) in send method?
[23:15:25] <mohsen_hassani> Hello guys. Doesn't removeClass('a-class') in jQuery 1.11 work?
[23:37:44] <jak2000> when i send parameters with ajax to my jsp page(gethttp.send("wvar1=5&wvar2=15&wvar3=25&wvar4=51&");) i want catch it: out.println("Parametro1: "+request.getParameter("wvar1"));   but request.getParameter("wvar1") is null, other parameters too, how to fix? thanks
