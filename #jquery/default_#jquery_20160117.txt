[00:22:48] <neonpixel> Hello all! I'm recently coming into the glorious world of jquery+jquery ui and find myself needing a good js/css loader. Any recommendations?
[00:24:58] <snover> neonpixel: requirejs
[00:39:31] <neonpixel> snover: i was torn between requirejs and lazyload
[00:39:52] <snover> don’t be torn. use a real module loader. use requirejs.
[00:40:23] <neonpixel> Fair enough. Installing now ;)
[00:57:41] <neonpixel> snover: how about for windowing? (MDI stuff) -- i'm playing with simone right now but can't get some things to work just yet
[00:58:46] <snover> neonpixel: sounds like you are wanting a ui toolkit for application development? if so use dojo or extjs or similar
[00:59:59] <snover> neonpixel: http://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.10/dijit_layout/index.html something like this?
[03:07:21] <HalObit> Could anyone answer me please?
[04:07:05] <Xentil> HalObit: yes
[04:07:36] <HalObit> Xentil, Hi what?
[04:09:09] <Xentil> HalObit: how are you ?
[04:09:34] <HalObit> Xentil, Fine! Thank you! and you?
[04:09:52] <Xentil> HalObit: i am fine too
[04:10:12] <HalObit> Xentil, That's great.
[04:10:20] <Xentil> HalObit: you wrote "Could anyone answer me please?" an hour ago ;)
[04:10:33] <HalObit> Xentil, oh, then you are an angel
[04:10:43] <HalObit> who has come to save me
[04:11:19] <HalObit> Xentil, What is this script file used for?
[04:11:20] <HalObit> <script src="media/jui/js/jquery-noconflict.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[04:11:31] <HalObit> jquery-noconflict.js
[04:13:07] <Xentil> HalObit: did you google it ?
[04:13:39] <HalObit> Xentil, Yes there were some texts claiming that it's a jquery method, but it's nit
[04:13:41] <HalObit> not*
[04:13:59] <Xentil> HalObit: w8...
[04:17:12] <HalObit> Xentil, Thanks
[04:22:51] <Xentil> HalObit: ok, i think it is for https://api.jquery.com/jquery.noconflict/
[04:31:39] <HalObit> Xentil, Thank you so much!
[04:34:32] <Cork> Xentil. HalObit: bno noconflict is part of jquery
[04:34:48] <Cork> HalObit: what is the content of that file?
[04:34:56] <Cork> bno=no
[04:35:33] <Xentil> Cork: but maybe this file is only using this function
[04:35:56] <Xentil> not define it
[04:36:58] <Cork> Xentil: maybe
[04:37:05] <Cork> it is part of joomla
[04:37:44] <Xentil> yes
[04:39:03] <Cork> there we go
[04:39:13] <Xentil> and maybe drupal too
[04:39:39] <Cork> so https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/blob/staging/media/jui/js/jquery-noconflict.js
[04:39:49] <Cork> Xentil: no drupal doesn't invoke noconflict
[04:39:55] <Cork> HalObit: https://github.com/joomla/joomla-cms/blob/staging/media/jui/js/jquery-noconflict.js
[04:40:37] <Xentil> Cork: https://www.drupal.org/node/578712
[04:40:39] <Cork> a bit sadening that they have a http call for a single function invoktion :/
[04:40:48] <HalObit> Cork, Thanks for the answer
[04:40:51] <HalObit> It's part of Joomla
[04:41:00] <HalObit> but not like that
[04:41:31] <HalObit> the file contains:
[04:41:31] <HalObit> jQuery.noConflict();
[04:41:40] <Cork> ya, that is what i pointed to
[04:41:50] <Cork> that is the js file from the joomla cms repo
[04:42:36] <HalObit> Cork, What does it do?
[04:42:52] <Cork> HalObit: it removes support for calling jquery though $
[04:43:17] <HalObit> Cork, Oh, so everytime for calling something you don't need to use $?
[04:43:33] <Cork> HalObit: you have to use jQuery
[04:43:50] <Cork> $('') => jQuery('')
[04:44:01] <HalObit> Just like this : jQuery.noConflict();
[04:44:04] <HalObit> or this:
[04:44:11] <Cork> well $.noConflict() works too
[04:44:12] <HalObit> JQuery.somethingtocall()
[04:44:29] <Cork> as long as it is the first call to noConflict :)
[04:44:39] <HalObit> hmmmm
[04:45:02] <HalObit> I'm not familiar with JQuery yet
[04:45:14] <HalObit> I should be familiar to understand what you are talking about
[04:45:19] <HalObit> Thank you so much
[04:45:47] <Cork> HalObit: $ is a function $() {}
[04:46:00] <Cork> when you load jquery it does window.$ = window.jQuery
[04:46:04] <Cork> so those two are the same
[04:46:32] <Cork> before that it does something like var old$ = window.$;
[04:46:43] <Cork> and if you call noConflict it does window.$ = old$
[04:46:55] <Cork> so $ stops working for jQuery
[04:47:25] <Cork> if you're accustom to using $ you know how to use jQuery cause it is the same thing
[04:47:37] <Cork> just a longer name
[04:48:48] <HalObit> Cork, Thank you so much
[04:48:54] <Cork> np
[06:24:53] <pikaren> will jquery try to fetch the image before its appended to dom? $("<img />").attr('src', url);
[06:55:18] <Cork> pikaren: jquery won't
[06:55:22] <Cork> but the browser will

[08:00:04] <hellyeah> i am wokrking with jquery ui datepicker when you select a date for example january 5 i want to disable january 1,2,3,4 in the other datepicker. How can i do that? Is thata any function for that? http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/606/
[08:02:04] <sidthekid> Hi, can anyone tell me how to make this work? http://jsbin.com/cugadomeyu/edit?html,js,console,output
[08:05:26] <shoky> hellyeah yea you can do it using the "beforeShowDay" option
[08:06:37] <hellyeah> hmm but the other datepicker should know what date is selecte in pervious datepicker
[08:06:45] <hellyeah> beforeshownday can handle that?
[08:06:59] <shoky> you haev to handle it, in the beforeShowDay handler ;p
[08:07:45] <shoky> it receives a date and you return an array looking like [selectable, "", ""]
[08:07:53] <shoky> where selectable is true or false
[08:08:34] <hellyeah> actyually onSelect i am getting the date into an array
[08:08:44] <shoky> example http://jsfiddle.net/tqn3q858/
[08:08:55] <hellyeah> and i can use that this array in other datepicker beforeshownday
[08:10:13] <hellyeah> let me check
[08:11:03] <hellyeah> let me try smt quick
[08:22:01] <hellyeah> shoky: you still there  just try t push the date into from array and try to use from array in beforeShownDay but it disabled all the daates can you take a look what is wrong here? http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/608/
[08:24:31] <shoky> hellyeah: donno what youre doing there but here  http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/610/
[08:26:57] <shoky> hellyeah  another example http://jsfiddle.net/tqn3q858/2/
[08:27:14] <hellyeah> shoky: this is what i try to do
[08:27:31] <hellyeah> thats why i tried to add date you select from datepicker to from array
[08:28:11] <hellyeah> thanks
[08:28:11] <shoky> you didn't add the date, you added  $('.from')
[08:28:41] <shoky> which is a collection of all .from  elements ;p
[08:29:04] <hellyeah> ic
[08:29:12] <hellyeah> it is global lookup :p
[08:29:18] <hellyeah> it is bad
[08:29:36] <hellyeah> also i am getting all
[08:29:38] <shoky> it's not a date.
[08:29:42] <shoky> it's a DOM element
[08:29:58] <hellyeah> yes
[08:31:18] <hellyeah> asnyway thanks
[08:31:21] <hellyeah> :xd
[09:17:09] <hellyeah> hey pls check line 37 and 38 why it didnt work i have to cancel button click under a spesific circumstances http://jsfiddle.net/TMsXM/613/

[14:53:49] <Random> Hi
[14:54:02] <Random> I have a question unrelated to jquery, is it still okay for me to ask?
[14:54:09] <Random> It is about webdevelopement though :/
[14:55:02] <Random> for example, if my url was http://somedomain.com, how would I do to get this url instead http://para.somedomain.com
[14:55:08] <Random> I ask this question since that you define all routes like '/something', after the domain itself

[15:07:41] <arc_> nice
[15:32:46] <cryptopsy> what are some popular keyboard driven jquery menus?
[15:33:15] <cryptopsy> it would be nice if you could also have accordion in the menu. as far as i know jqueryui doesnt support keyboard navigation in the menus
[15:34:51] <arc_> seems like it would be pretty simple to implement keyboard navigation in any existing menu
[15:36:22] <PCatinean> There is a platform I am using for content management and when I first add the content via javascript jqueryui resizable and draggable on a element works
[15:36:40] <PCatinean> After that when I save the html to the database and refresh draggable works but resizable does not eve though the resize corners come up
[15:36:46] <PCatinean> and no errors in the console
[15:36:46] <cryptopsy> arc_: what do you suggest?
[15:36:51] <PCatinean> any idea how I can debug this?
[15:38:03] <arc_> depends how complicated the menu is. something as simple as a keypress event handler with a switch statement could work, depending on your application
[15:50:13] <cryptopsy> does jqueryui's tree support that?
[16:23:20] <lolquery> i would like some help with this regular expression: https://repl.it/Be6X
[16:23:49] <lolquery> i would like to match only letters
[16:30:06] <shoky> [A-Za-z]
[17:20:23] <changa> how do you get rid of empty strings in js?**
[17:25:22] <snover> what does that even mean
[17:27:57] <changa> snover: https://repl.it/Be6X/5
[17:27:59] <changa> that's my code
[17:28:09] <changa> i am trying to only match for a-z characters
[17:28:17] <changa> and i am getting an empty string
[19:58:03] <klmlfl> x post
[19:58:06] <klmlfl> I’m having trouble using jquery/Ajax to get json data from an endpoint. The goal is to display the json data on my html page..nothing fancy. Here’s my gist: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/15834d12aaf8e4500760
[19:58:14] <klmlfl> Here’s the relevant doc: http://docs.gurock.com/testrail-api2/accessing
[19:58:33] <klmlfl> Any idea what I’m doing wrong to get this: HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request; Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8; Date: Mon, 18 Jan 2016 00:54:29 GMT; Server: Apache; Content-Length: 77; Connection: keep-alive ?
[20:00:46] <shoky> klmlfl: the docs don't say anything about jsonp, or cross-domain access. the server has to specifically enable cross-domain access from browsers
[20:01:01] <shoky> klmlfl: do you know that its supposed to work with JSONP?
[20:01:15] <klmlfl> shoky: Not sure. If I change that to json, I get this in the console: XMLHttpRequest cannot load https://differenceengine.testrail.net/index.php?/api/v2/get_projects/. Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://localhost:63342' is therefore not allowed access. The response had HTTP status code 400.
[20:01:34] <shoky> klmlfl: right that's the error you get because the server doesn't allow cross-domain access
[20:02:07] <shoky> klmlfl: if the server doesnt specifically enable it (either via CORS or JSONP) then you have to have a server-side proxy that does the request for the browser client
[20:04:05] <klmlfl> shoky: I saw this, and thought it would be possible: https://discuss.gurock.com/t/api-requires-application-json/1118/2
[20:04:44] <shoky> klmlfl: then you should have actually read it :)  " JSONP is not really supported by the API  "
[20:04:56] <klmlfl> I just saw this now.
[20:05:42] <shoky> and he writes the workaround as i said, with a server-side proxy
[20:09:42] <klmlfl> shoky: I apologize. I’m new to programming, especially Javascript. I was able to use the Java bindings to get the info I needed (http://docs.gurock.com/testrail-api2/bindings-java), and I figured since I wanted the info to be displayed on my page, it would be easiest to do it in Javascript.
[20:10:06] <klmlfl> I’m not familiar with CORS, JSONP, etc.
[20:14:18] <shoky> klmlfl: it's ok. browsers have special restrictions for accessing other domains from a page on some domain
[20:14:44] <shoky> klmlfl: JSONP is a hack workaround for it that uses an injected <script> tag. CORS is the proper way for the server to allow it, via http headers like Access-Control-Allow-Origin.  for either jsonp or cors, the server has to specifically be configured for it
[20:16:17] <shoky> klmlfl: if you wanna read about it, serach for same-origin policy
[20:17:02] <shoky> (java doesn't run in a webpage in a browser, so there's no such problem there)
[20:21:29] <klmlfl> Got it, thank you
[20:22:29] <klmlfl> I’ll attempt my goal with a Spring project (cringe) since i have the info I need using the Java bindings..
[21:09:30] <DexDeadly_2> I have a form that submits to another page, I want to know if using javascript I can stop the form from inserting into the database if a certain condition is met and go back to the previous page or is this not the right way to do it
