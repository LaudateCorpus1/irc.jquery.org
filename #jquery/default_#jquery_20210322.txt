[07:00:08] <beshoo> how can i coyp dom elemint to clipboard
[07:23:14] <superschnell> What is preferable for data-* attributes: using .attr('data-something') or .data('something')? One would presume the latter, right?
[07:33:02] <superschnell> Because I've read that .data doesn  work no the actual DOM, but on the cached DOM?
[08:00:22] <dimi1947> Î™ am using jjquery 1.11.1 I want to upgrade...I suppose I must use the migrate plugin so I can go to 3...and then proceed from there..correct?
[09:20:14] <Cork> superschnell: .data() does a conversion of the data in the attribute through JSON.parse
[09:20:24] <Cork> superschnell: setting through .data() doesn't touch the dom
[09:20:53] <Cork> so it depends a bit on what your goal is
[10:12:30] <EugenA> I try to trigger a click inside $(function() {})
[10:12:38] <EugenA> nothing happens
[10:12:43] <EugenA> but if I do the same command from console, it works
[10:12:50] <EugenA> $('#div_' + activityPreselection).trigger('click');
[10:14:10] <EugenA> this is how click event is registered: $(document).on('click', '.neben .divTaet', function() { ... });
[10:30:41] <cutiepie> Howdy! Any chance anybody can help with https://codepen.io/cutiepieinthesky/pen/abpomxb ?
[10:35:13] <Cork> EugenA: are you sure the element exist on dom ready?
[10:35:33] <Cork> EugenA: might be it is loaded through ajax or added in load event or similar
[10:35:45] <Cork> cutiepie: please ask the question in the channel
[10:44:25] <cutiepie> oh right yeah good idea
[10:48:13] <cutiepie> At https://codepen.io/cutiepieinthesky/pen/abpomxb how do I make the input field lookalike wrap itself around the new post on click? So it looks like the form bulges out of it in a smooth and natural manner.
[10:53:58] <Cork> cutiepie: remove the hard coded height from the gray area
[10:54:34] <Cork> min-height might be what your looking for
[10:55:08] <cutiepie> Cork: hey there :)
[10:57:09] <cutiepie> Cork: seems like maybe i can do without min-height as well, unless you had something specific in mind?
[11:09:13] <cutiepie> strange that form.addClass("hidden") won't work either
[11:10:05] <cutiepie> Cork: so to what do i owe this pleasure? :D is it rude to tip? maybe i can offer some of my highly sought after design services?
[11:10:17] <cutiepie> this isn't the first time you've helped me in a pinch to put it like that
[11:30:15] <cutiepie> anyway thanks, cya later man
[11:49:59] <dimi1947> is there a big difference bwtween jquery 3 and 3.6....so as to justify going from the first to the second?
[11:55:21] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you can look up the release notes for the various releases.
[11:55:30] <robertmaxrees> upgrading is generally worth it though.
[11:57:43] <dimi1947> probably that is the general rule of thumb....but I am more specific now....
[11:58:06] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:01:28] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you're basically asking for people to condense every release since 2016 for you :)  some changes others might not care about you will and vice verse.
[12:01:30] <robertmaxrees> *versa
[12:03:07] <dimi1947> I see....
[12:04:07] <dimi1947> but I suppose 3 must be a "a good point" meaning not very old
[12:04:23] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:04:28] <robertmaxrees> "a good point" as in...?
[12:05:16] <dimi1947> I will be able to do my job adequately...
[12:05:25] <robertmaxrees> why not just jump to the latest version?
[12:06:13] <dimi1947> that is a reasonable argument....I had 1.11.1 first and I am doing this gradually
[12:06:25] <robertmaxrees> just go straight to latest :)
[12:06:35] <robertmaxrees> the changes will be there regardless haha
[12:06:41] <dimi1947> ok
[12:28:12] <cutiepie> Cork: now i understand what you mean, im so silly
[12:58:36] <cutiepie> https://codepen.io/cutiepieinthesky/pen/abpomxb
[12:58:38] <cutiepie> pretty hot
[14:43:53] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/trw6spm8/ how can I create the top div from the information in the bottom div.
[14:45:02] <robertmaxrees> wrap it with that wrapper div, grab the alt text and append it to the image div in a separate div.
[14:46:19] <robertmaxrees> impliednude
[14:47:10] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> I mean as follows. I have a project where there is 5000 images. They want to be able to upload images and on hover it show the alt tag as a div overlay.
[14:47:24] <impliednude> like the first example.
[14:47:41] <robertmaxrees> render it from the server with that and hide/show using css.
[14:47:41] <impliednude> but only using the original alt in the image without doing more work
[14:48:07] <impliednude> robertmaxrees> they want to avoid writing serverside code
[14:48:28] <impliednude> other than the easiest js/jquery
[14:48:53] <impliednude> and let the client take care of it.
[14:49:27] <robertmaxrees> that's... incredibly dumb.
[14:49:41] <impliednude> it is but this is just a proof of concept
[14:50:19] <robertmaxrees> lol these always turn into the final solutions :) but w/e - bind event listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave, create the markup, etc.
[15:43:31] <impliednude> so something like return $(this).siblings('img').attr("alt"); how do I create the div to wrap each in?
[15:44:21] <robertmaxrees> you generally want to use .prop() for those, but yeah.  .prop('alt') is how you get the value of alt.  and you just create the div :)
[15:44:34] <impliednude> what's that look like?
[15:44:58] <robertmaxrees> var $foo = $('<div>');
[15:45:19] <robertmaxrees> can also do var $foo = $('<div></div>'); - both give the same end result.
[15:45:32] <impliednude> ahh
[17:29:00] <bboy> Hi guys, I created a repeated form and I'm finding an issue in reading the values in an array using jquery
[17:29:14] <bboy> https://jsfiddle.net/hdalang/4a0Lnefx/4/
[17:29:35] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:29:43] <robertmaxrees> mind clarifying where in that JS you're having issues?
[17:30:31] <bboy> I placed alert after the for loop and none of them are working even hello it's not working. I'm also not sure if this is the best way to code
[17:30:59] <robertmaxrees> well first up, you've got ids in that code.
[17:31:15] <robertmaxrees> an id can only be used once per page.
[17:31:42] <bboy> OK, this is a good information
[17:31:47] <robertmaxrees> also: look your console - var majour, degree, dept, univ, year = []; you declare majour but don't set it to an array.
[17:31:56] <robertmaxrees> which is what the error is telling you.
[17:32:23] <robertmaxrees> also: don't use onclick - bind event listeners using JS.
[17:32:41] <bboy> ok, I will change it
[17:33:03] <robertmaxrees> finally: why are you trying to increment and index like that?
[17:33:35] <robertmaxrees> are you planning on submitting this data via ajax?
[17:33:40] <bboy> yes
[17:33:52] <bboy> I'm planning to submit the data via Ajax
[17:34:11] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't do it this way then :) you're spreading the data for each line over multiple arrays and then hoping that the indices match.
[17:34:19] <robertmaxrees> do a single array of objects instead.
[17:34:46] <bboy> OK, you mean key and value?
[17:34:49] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:34:52] <robertmaxrees> i mean an array of objects.
[17:36:24] <bboy> OK, I got it. Thanks I will try it
[17:36:59] <robertmaxrees> so instead of that for loop, you can .map() over all $('.eduField') and return an object containing the input names and their values.  ezpz :)
[17:42:56] <bboy> OK, thank you very much
