[01:05:58] <pokmo> is there a way to cosmetically hide an img without changing the display value?
[01:11:12] <Robdgreat> pokmo: why don't you want to change the display? that's the usual way of hiding an element
[01:11:51] <Cork> pokmo: you can change the visibility or opacity values
[01:12:13] <Cork> Robdgreat: from conversation yesterday working around a adblocker blocker
[01:13:20] <pokmo> yeah
[01:13:22] <pokmo> haha still
[01:13:31] <pokmo> the admin and i are playing cat and mouse
[01:13:34] <pokmo> because my code is public
[01:13:50] <pokmo> i'm trying to hide his banner without changing the attributes
[01:14:52] <Cork> you can't really do that
[01:42:56] <Woet> pokmo: perhaps stop using his website if you disagree with his banners?
[04:16:41] <lingeeal> hi, how do i write this in plain js:  $('thead th:nth-child(1)') ?
[04:17:35] <lingeeal> sorry for line break, here $('thead th:nth-child(1)')
[04:59:38] <AdamPDotty> document.querySelectorAll('thead th:nth-child(1)') but it is still not really the same.
[05:08:47] <Cork> how you would write it depends quite a bit on what you plan to do with it
[05:09:06] <Cork> that is one of the features of jquery, that many cases is handled the same way
[05:09:21] <Cork> native js doesn't do it like that
[06:34:33] <undefined_bob> does ie11 and Edge handle jquery/javascript differently than all the other browsers?
[06:35:42] <Omnipotent> Hello
[06:35:56] <Omnipotent> How do I get rid of the internal block, the current code I have written does not work
[06:35:58] <Omnipotent> https://jsfiddle.net/xdruzx96/
[06:36:16] <Omnipotent> I want to get rid of entire part -> <div class="def-block def-inline-example"><span class="dbox-example">Some games and gaming forums are crawling with annoying noobs.</span></div>
[06:47:38] <undefined_bob> Omnipotent: maybe like this? https://jsfiddle.net/xdruzx96/3/
[06:48:42] <undefined_bob> but you will still have <div class="def-blockdef-inline-example"></div> in your code
[06:48:51] <undefined_bob> I think
[06:49:06] <undefined_bob> better wait for some more skilled guys
[06:50:03] <Omnipotent> undefined_bob, I am first finding out def-content myself from the page though
[06:53:31] <undefined_bob> Omnipotent: but $( "div" ).remove( ".def-blockdef-inline-example" ); works too, I think. just the whitespace in your classname cause that it doesnt work
[06:54:27] <Omnipotent> nope not the whitespace
[06:54:31] <Omnipotent> that's what I am not understanding
[06:57:21] <undefined_bob> maybe I'm wrong but if you add the whitespace again and take a look on the html dump you will see that the dev get removed when you replace the whitespace with a - for example. if you dont remove the whitespace it doesnt get removed. Or did you mean why it doesnt get removed with the whitespace?
[07:03:19] <Omnipotent> undefined_bob, https://jsfiddle.net/xdruzx96/4/
[07:03:23] <Omnipotent> even this does not work
[07:04:01] <undefined_bob> you are aware of that Class names can't have spaces in them it will make them two classes. class="def-blockdef inline-example" is like class="class one class two"
[07:07:48] <undefined_bob> but take a look on this: https://jsfiddle.net/xdruzx96/6/
[07:08:40] <undefined_bob> but I'm no pro and I'm scared to say something wrong while trying to help you
[07:30:32] <Cork> Omnipotent: internal block?
[07:30:47] <AdamPDotty> errrm, remove?
[07:33:09] <AdamPDotty> https://jsfiddle.net/xdruzx96/9/ ?
[07:33:34] <Omnipotent> AdamPDotty, perfect that one works too!
[07:34:08] <Omnipotent> Cork, yeah I actually wanted to remove the entire internal block, I just want the outer text " a newbie, especially a person who is new to an online community and whose online participation and interactions display a lack of skill or knowledge: "
[07:36:03] <Cork> Omnipotent: if you don't want to modify the original document https://jsfiddle.net/xdruzx96/10/
[07:36:09] <Cork> else ya, just .remove()
[07:36:15] <AdamPDotty> so you want container.find(selector).remove(). That is not the same as container.remove('selector')
[07:36:44] <Omnipotent> Yeah I got that from the other guy in javascript
[07:36:51] <Omnipotent> thanks though AdamPDotty
[07:36:59] <Omnipotent> Cork, Yeah
[11:08:43] * Moonspell Boa noite !
[13:15:36] <robertmaxrees> gooooooood morning #jquery
[13:32:29] <dimi1947> I know what serialize() does but there is something that really puzzles me about it
[13:36:29] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/0uLyfr1c/1/ line 75....what is that reason for not sending form data as part of an object?
[13:37:56] <dimi1947> in the example above no object is used and I cannot remember why I did it this way
[16:00:55] <ahoo> hi
[16:01:08] <ahoo> how to elegantly inline create elements?
[16:01:29] <ahoo> multi level elements like a table, tr and tds
[16:01:55] <ahoo> without a third party templating lib
[18:13:53] <aeyxa> can you guys help me with how I do this https://pastebin.com/D6Hy4YjW
[18:19:04] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[18:30:38] <aeyxa_> gonna just do it server sided in python instead lul
[18:33:40] <taplar> do you want to learn to do it on the front though?  even if you don't use it, you'd still learn something
[18:43:31] <aeyxa_> taplar, sure, I have two inputs where sometimes I have first_name last_name and sometimes I have full_name, when I have a full_name I wanted to split it and append to the array I send to the server as first_name last_name.
[18:44:51] <aeyxa_> I just don't know how to say "if form with class of <class> has an input field with id/name of <id/name>, do something with id/name"
[18:46:54] <taplar> $(selectorForTheForm).find(selectorForTheInput)
[18:47:23] <taplar> with selectors being similar to css selectors
[18:47:24] <aeyxa_> thanks
