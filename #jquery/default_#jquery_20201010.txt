[17:34:51] <Buntspecht> Is there a way to wrap some text into a new text node?
[18:33:43] <robertmaxrees> Buntspecht whatcha mean?
[19:16:41] <Buntspecht> robertmaxrees: Like $("<span>").text(...), but without the wrapping <span>
[19:17:40] <robertmaxrees> mind giving more context?
[19:17:51] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i'm not sure why you'd need that :)
[19:18:27] <Buntspecht> I want to append simple text to a container element, just not sure how to do that with jQuery
[19:18:43] <robertmaxrees> .append('foo');
[19:19:11] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8f67son1/
[19:21:17] <Buntspecht> Try 'foo<b>bar</b>'
[19:21:51] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  are you expecting that to insert as html?
[19:22:00] <Buntspecht> No, plain text
[19:22:15] <Buntspecht> Like what .text() does
[19:23:53] <robertmaxrees> :) shoulda mentioned that sooner - there are a few ways to handle that.  1 would be to escape <, >, and /.  another would be to use <pre> with the occasional nested <code> for multi-line.
[19:29:28] <Buntspecht> Well yes, I could do the escaping manually. But JS already provides document.createTextNode, just thought jQuery would provide some kind of wrapper for that
[19:30:26] <robertmaxrees> not directly in the way you're looking for.  there are a few different ways to accomplish the same end result - could also grab the .text() of the element and then concat the new stuff, etc.
[19:34:29] <Buntspecht> I think I'll go with .append(document.createTextNode(...)) :p
[19:35:22] <robertmaxrees> heh - I might re-think your basic approach and consider pre with code tags to display code but :shrug:  your codebase :)
[19:41:38] <Buntspecht> Hhm, <pre> might actually be better
[19:41:55] <Buntspecht> It's not really code, more literal Unicode characters :p
[19:42:25] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[19:43:42] <Buntspecht> Literally that, single Unicode characters. It's going to be a lookup table when finished
[19:44:32] <Buntspecht> plus explaination text
[19:44:46] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying to display the escaped chars literally, instead of as the characters themselves?
[19:46:25] <Buntspecht> e.g. there's "U+000C <control> (FORM FEED (FF))"
[19:46:56] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.  yeah - using pre is probably the better solution here then.
[19:47:16] <Buntspecht> Okay
[20:21:25] <atxq> hi
[20:21:51] <robertmaxrees> hello
[20:21:53] <atxq> is it possible to pass a json obj to jquery animate?
[20:22:03] <robertmaxrees> not sure i follow.
[20:23:18] <atxq> var css ={"left":"500px","top":"500px"}; $("#div1").animate( css, 5000 );
[20:23:27] <robertmaxrees> fow what it's work, that's not JSON.  that's just an object.
[20:23:30] <atxq> is this possible in jquery?
[20:23:31] <robertmaxrees> *it's worth
[20:23:49] <robertmaxrees> and check out the docs :) https://api.jquery.com/animate/
[20:24:23] <atxq> is it possible to pass an obj to animate?
[20:24:31] <robertmaxrees> what do the docs tell you? :)
[20:24:50] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/oVlwKZa.png
[20:27:16] <atxq> it says "An object of CSS properties and values that the animation will move toward."
[20:27:22] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[20:27:49] <atxq> that example is not working
[20:28:00] <robertmaxrees> which means that yes, you can pass it an object similar to the one you have there, though you will need to make sure the values are the correct type.
[20:28:07] <robertmaxrees> so instead of '500px', you just pass 500
[20:28:45] <atxq> so the "px" is not allowed?
[20:28:53] <atxq> interesting
[20:29:29] <robertmaxrees> correct. depending on the property, you need to just pass a number.
[20:29:40] <robertmaxrees> other cases it'll be a string - it just depends.
[20:30:52] <atxq> the example is not working when I use "500px" or "500" or 500
[20:31:11] <robertmaxrees> mind making a jsfiddle to show what you're doing?
[20:31:35] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the markup and related css, it's hard to know where the issue lies.
[20:32:20] <atxq> I am storing all my css values in a json file
[20:32:37] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't help me troubleshoot your issue at all :)
[20:37:08] <robertmaxrees> atxq this is why i need to see a test case from you: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xntrohp2/
[20:38:03] <robertmaxrees> i can take your example and make a host of assumptions to make it function.  perhaps you're not setting a position property in your css somewhere?  maybe the element doesn't exist at all?  maybe your code is running before the page has rendered?
[20:38:38] <atxq> I am putting an example together right now. Just need a few minutes.
[20:39:26] <atxq> I am happy to see your example working.
[22:01:02] <atxq> thanks robertmaxrees, my code is working now. was able to fix the issue because of you.
[22:02:24] <robertmaxrees> what was the problem?
[22:08:26] <atxq> was a typo in the selector
[22:08:43] <robertmaxrees> ah
[22:09:31] <atxq> you helped me clarify a few things in the process
[22:09:40] <robertmaxrees> cool
