[09:59:30] <robertparkerx> how would I scroll a header out of view when it reaches a certain position? Let's say that position is a ID.
[09:59:47] <robertparkerx> and then make that ID sticky
[09:59:56] <robertparkerx> the header is already sticky
[10:01:13] <robertparkerx> not scroll but slide
[10:02:52] <robertparkerx> I think I found how to hide it
[10:03:55] <robertparkerx> but this does position by top

[10:06:50] <Corny> Hey, anyone aware if CVE-2020-67089 was created for jQuery lately?
[10:07:10] <Corny> Or is Dell just wrong here in their advisory
[10:07:10] <Corny> https://www.dell.com/support/security/en-us/details/546620/DSA-2020-232-Dell-EMC-Secure-Remote-Services-Virtual-Edition-Security-Update-for-Multiple-Third-P
[10:09:31] <robertparkerx> I think I got it
[10:09:32] <robertparkerx> http://jsfiddle.net/om52b06w/
[11:43:20] <Miles8of9> what's wrong with this code? 	let myvar = 155;
[11:43:20] <Miles8of9>   let myvar2 = 'something-${myvar}-somethingelse';
[11:43:35] <Miles8of9> it used to run fine but now i get an error
[12:30:44] <robertmaxrees> Miles8of9 that's... pretty vague information.  what about it isn't working?
[12:31:29] <robertmaxrees> also: hopw are you using jquery there? :)
[12:31:49] <Miles8of9> it's treated like part of the string
[12:31:57] <Miles8of9> not replaced with variable
[12:32:07] <robertmaxrees> well yeah - you're nopt using a template string there.
[12:32:25] <robertmaxrees> you want ` not '
[12:32:44] <Miles8of9> O_O
[12:33:18] <robertparkerx> Is there a way to make the animation/transition of changing position and top values?
[12:33:43] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx show code with what you're trying to do.
[12:34:11] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees https://url.hashdev.org/3b
[12:34:13] <Miles8of9> omg incredible i didn't knwo
[12:34:16] <Miles8of9> know
[12:34:51] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals
[12:34:52] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:35:44] <Miles8of9> is it a bad practice doing so? would it be better to use 'something' + myvar + 'somethingelse' ?
[12:36:03] <robertmaxrees> depends on a whole host of factors.  none of which are jquery related ;)
[12:37:54] <robertparkerx> for somer eason on fiddle it shows it slide out of view
[12:38:09] <robertmaxrees> robertmaxrees is that what you're expecting to have happen?
[12:38:16] <robertparkerx> http://jsfiddle.net/om52b06w/
[12:38:16] <robertmaxrees> ugh * robertparkerx
[12:38:34] <robertparkerx> just make it smoother
[12:38:40] <robertparkerx> I can show a live example
[12:38:41] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:38:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:38:52] <robertparkerx> oh
[12:39:01] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to do it for you ;)
[12:39:12] <robertparkerx> No I meant just to make it smoother
[12:39:18] <robertparkerx> Not you do it
[12:39:24] <robertmaxrees> what about it isn't smooth?
[12:39:36] <robertparkerx> it just goes out of view
[12:39:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:39:45] <robertparkerx> on my dev, not jsfiddle
[12:40:03] <robertmaxrees> show me the dev, I guess.
[12:40:06] <robertmaxrees> let's fix that part first
[12:40:27] <robertparkerx> wait I think my top value is wrong
[12:40:42] <robertparkerx> http://malmohusmaklarna180412-939-367732270.dev3.mildmedia-dev.eu/till-salu/ljungstersvgen-12a-vbcaja/

[12:42:13] <robertmaxrees> remove the login ;)

[12:43:06] <robertmaxrees> so what isn't working here?
[12:43:22] <robertparkerx> it is working but I just wanted to know how I could make it smoother
[12:43:44] <robertmaxrees> ... you keep schanging what the issue is...
[12:43:46] <robertmaxrees> *changing
[12:43:52] <robertparkerx> I'm sorry
[12:44:10] <Miles8of9> ultra-hi-res images!! lol...
[12:44:14] <robertmaxrees> so what's the bug?  earlier you said it didn't work, nnow it's something about it not being "smooth"?
[12:44:17] <robertparkerx> How can I animate the top position to make it slide out of view
[12:44:30] <robertparkerx> I thought I said that at first
[12:44:48] <robertparkerx> I got it working earlier
[12:44:48] <robertmaxrees> lol you said like 3 separate things ;)
[12:45:00] <robertmaxrees> robertparkerx just use a plugin for this and move on with your day.
[12:45:16] <robertparkerx> :(
[12:45:20] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:45:39] <robertparkerx> I'll try
[12:46:15] <robertmaxrees> plugins for stuff like this are good.
[12:58:33] <robertparkerx> css transition did it nicely
[13:05:01] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees I didn't mean to sound like I did
[13:05:14] <robertparkerx> It wasn't what I meant
[13:05:15] <robertmaxrees> all good :)
[13:05:26] <robertmaxrees> thanks for clarifying :)
[13:11:51] <Alex8532> Hi, has anyone use datatables.net before?  How do you handle an extreme custom pagination case where I want to load data through JavaScript and make sure I can set the right pageInfo at the same time.
[13:12:05] <Alex8532> Meant to put a question mark...
[13:12:11] <robertmaxrees> "extreme custom pagination case"?
[13:12:40] <robertmaxrees> do you mean you're loading data via ajax?
[13:13:25] <Alex8532> robertmaxrees: I want to load via JavaScript array, but I want the same ability to change PageInfo like ajax does.
[13:13:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?  are you loading the data via ajax or not?
[13:14:25] <Alex8532> robertmaxrees: Yes I am.
[13:14:41] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so what's the issuye?  the example on their site is pretty straightforward.
[13:17:31] <Alex8532> robertmaxrees: Let's just say this... I cannot use the ajax method.  The REST Api I am using cannot output the results that datatables.net expects.  So, I want to load JavaScript array into datatables.net instead.  However, I think pageInfo will be screwed up.  The ajax method returns that information each time to datatables.net.
[13:17:53] <robertmaxrees> i can't help you if you cannot give me straight answers.
[13:17:55] <robertmaxrees> sorry :)
[13:18:00] <Alex8532> Okay, no problem.
[13:18:05] <Alex8532> Thanks anyways.
[13:18:18] <Alex8532> I will probably just roll out my own table.
[13:18:24] <robertmaxrees> cool
[13:19:55] <robertmaxrees> just to clarify: what you mean is you would like to use server-side processing, but your data format can't match what datatables is expecting ;)
[13:20:01] <robertmaxrees> that's all you had to say fwiw.
[13:20:09] <Alex8532> robertmaxrees: Yes
[13:20:37] <robertmaxrees> lol okay.
[13:22:50] <Alex8532> I was trying to be as detailed as possible to help.
[13:23:27] <robertmaxrees> the confusion was when you said you were both using ajax and that you weren't :)  that's where ya lost me.
[13:23:41] <robertmaxrees> i would check out the columnDefs iirc.
[13:24:16] <robertmaxrees> could be wrong though.  i recall that you can transform data somewhere inside of DT.  if you can't find it, i'd hit up their forums.
[13:25:42] <Alex8532> robertmaxrees: Thanks.
[13:26:17] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/manual/data/renderers this may help, as well.
[14:02:44] <Alex8532> robertmaxrees: Thanks
[14:08:03] <Alex8532> robertmaxrees: I decided just to do my own table.  However, let me point out what the problem is....
[14:08:04] <Alex8532> https://datatables.net/manual/server-side
[14:08:20] <Alex8532> My returned data doesn't match datatable expects.
[14:08:25] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[14:08:38] <robertmaxrees> i know - we clarified that earlier :)
[14:08:51] <Alex8532> So, I want to input my data via JavaScript array.
[14:09:06] <robertmaxrees> datatables offers methods to transform data.  you could probably use those methods to wrange from one format to another.
[14:09:18] <robertmaxrees> but :shrug: you do you :) i'm not a fan of datatables personally.
[14:09:35] <Alex8532> Me either.  I don't want to use React either.  Too heavy.
[14:10:50] <Alex8532> Mad that I wasted time on this.
[14:11:31] <robertmaxrees> you didn't really waste time tho.  you picked a direction, evaluated it, and decided it ultimately wasn't what you wanted :)
[14:11:53] <Alex8532> That's a positive spin I guess, LOL
[14:12:02] <robertmaxrees> it's software engineering ;)
[14:12:18] <robertmaxrees> learning what will and won't work.  can then lean on that knowledge in the future.
