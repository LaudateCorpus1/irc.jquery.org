[02:23:20] <zampa> so i have a input slider, how can i trigger a javascript event on change even if you havent let go of the mouse-key?
[02:23:37] <zampa> right now it only gets triggered after i move it a bit and release my mouse button, i'd like it to trigger on any change what so ever.
[03:07:13] <mindpattern> hey guys. i am trying to click a tab (in ebay) with jquery. i have the right element targetted but $(‘….’).click() does nothing. any ideas on how i can emulate a more authentic click?
[03:13:25] <localh0st> mindpattern: use trigger()
[03:13:39] <mindpattern> tried that localh0st
[03:13:41] <mindpattern> fixed it. just changed it to $(‘….’)[0].click() which apparently uses the dom version instead
[05:31:24] <hhee> i've found class using $(".cls") - how can i find next needed pairs - name="quantity" size="1" - and name="quantity2" value="1">
[05:39:01] <jimmyjo> hello - how can I find the class of the active element?
[05:39:10] <jimmyjo> in my document
[05:42:30] <sillyslux> zampa did you manage to get your custom title?
[05:44:04] <sillyslux> zampa, https://jsfiddle.net/2umbct2x/
[05:48:25] <Kartagis> jimmyjo: $(this).attr('class')
[05:48:44] <jimmyjo> thanks Kartagis
[05:48:52] <Kartagis> np
[05:49:38] <jimmyjo> problem is I tried and it's giving me 2 elements - this is because 1 element is above another via z-index. I only want to return the element with higher z-index. How can I do that?
[06:01:03] <zampa> sillyslux: eventually i managed to solve it. the issue was when you had say 15 a links with different titles each.
[06:01:23] <sillyslux> oh
[06:01:24] <zampa> but running a jquery script matching everything that has say a title and running .each() and a qtip for each fixed it... sort of.
[06:01:52] <zampa> $('div[tooltip-title]').each(function() {$(this).gtip(
[06:02:03] <zampa> from there you can now access $(this)
[06:02:34] <sillyslux> i c
[06:03:04] <zampa> now im facing a much weirder problem..
[06:03:38] <zampa> is the attribute data-value restricted in some way?
[06:04:00] <sillyslux> it should be a string
[06:05:43] <zampa> Ooooh i get the problem.
[06:05:44] <zampa> hmm..
[06:06:07] <zampa> i now create the qtip on document ready..
[06:06:25] <zampa> but when i have my tooltip for say 'gold' that value changes with time.
[06:06:40] <zampa> but the tooltip shows 0 as it was default 0 before the data was changed via jquery..
[06:07:39] <sillyslux> http://qtip2.com/api#api.updating
[06:09:59] <zampa> that. doesn't help me now does it?
[06:10:20] <sillyslux> i think it does
[06:10:30] <zampa> i always want to do: text: $(this).find('span').attr('data-value')
[06:10:51] <zampa> when someone hoovers over one specific div, i want that value to be shown.
[06:11:09] <zampa> but it seems to be created once, and thats it.
[06:11:13] <zampa> and thats on page load.
[06:13:08] <sillyslux> zampa, https://jsfiddle.net/2umbct2x/1/
[06:13:57] <zampa> that seeems....
[06:14:01] <zampa> crazy silly
[06:14:06] <zampa> i'd have to update uhm..
[06:14:12] <zampa> 40 tooltips every 5 seconds >.<
[06:14:45] <zampa> i'd be so much better if the tooltip werent pre-created. and would be created on hoovering over an object.
[06:17:05] <zampa> sort of like how a normal hoover works...
[06:17:36] <sillyslux> there's a .show method, maybe you can implement show-on-hover yourself and update the values in your implementation
[06:18:46] <zampa> i mean i get why its made the way its made.. just sucks when i have my entire page loaded in via jquery
[06:18:47] <sillyslux> oh, there are events, use one of these http://qtip2.com/guides#events
[06:18:49] <zampa> and its everchanging.
[06:19:45] <zampa> oh ...
[06:19:57] <zampa> like on events: show i can fetch the value
[06:19:59] <zampa> and change it.
[06:20:09] <zampa> hopefully..
[06:21:03] <fuchstronaut> say my name
[06:27:55] <sillyslux> zampa, https://jsfiddle.net/2umbct2x/2/
[06:28:59] <zampa> oooh.
[06:29:01] <zampa> that may be it..
[06:35:44] <zampa> works to 99% now.
[06:36:34] <zampa> i can update the value on the fly now thanks to your latest fiddlee..
[06:37:34] <zampa> but i need to set it to: "$(this).find('span').attr('data-value')" problem is in the events/show $(this) doesn't seem to exist anymore.
[06:39:13] <zampa> i wonder how i can fetch the object thats beeing rendered..
[06:49:28] <sillyslux> you can keep a handle with `var that = this;`
[06:49:37] <sillyslux> then use $(that)
[10:32:52] <Sagar> how do we access the 1st and 2nd rotate using jquery of an element transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(125deg) translateY(-200px) rotate(-125deg);?
[10:35:51] <taplar> huh?
[10:36:19] <Sagar> a div has set transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(125deg) translateY(-200px) rotate(-125deg); as in css property, how can we access the value of both the rotates via jquery?
[10:36:43] <taplar> css('transform') to get the string value and then do with it what you like
[10:38:22] <Sagar> its gives me matrix value how to i change it?
[10:39:54] <taplar> no clue about that
[10:40:36] <Sagar> :/
[10:40:37] <Sagar> anyone?
[10:42:55] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/70fs6jnx/ maybe
[10:43:50] <Sagar> it's not on style
[10:43:52] <Sagar> it's in css
[10:47:16] <Sagar> also i want to access ROTATE value in that
[10:47:49] <taplar> yeah, idk.  you might have to hitup a css room about that
[10:48:17] <Sagar> but we gotta access it via jquery
[10:48:23] <taplar> or js
[10:48:24] <Sagar> so jquery is the right room i think
[10:48:34] <taplar> but there may be a different css key that you can target to get what you want
[10:48:47] <Sagar> > how do we access the 1st and 2nd rotate using jquery of an element transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(125deg) translateY(-200px) rotate(-125deg);? a div has set transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(125deg) translateY(-200px) rotate(-125deg); as in css property, how can we access the value of both the rotates via jquery?
[10:49:14] <taplar> i saw your question.  and i showed you css('transform')
[10:49:25] <taplar> the fact that that is not in the form that you are after isn't a fault of the css method
[10:49:34] <taplar> it just may not be the way to go about it
[10:51:20] <taplar> if transform is like other css keys, such as border which you can provide multiple parts to that set multiple css keys, then it may be that there is a specific css key for the rotates that you can get with css() that i just don't know about
[10:51:27] <taplar> thus the suggestion to hitup a css room
[10:51:32] <shoky_> Sagar: you can only get the computed transform, which is in matrix form - it doesn't contain all the separate transformations - only their result
[10:51:36] <Brodingo> first google result https://www.google.com/search?q=css+get+rotation
[10:51:40] <shoky_> Sagar: so, you can use this  https://css-tricks.com/get-value-of-css-rotation-through-javascript/
[10:51:49] <shoky_> Sagar: but that will probably give you a rotation angle of 0
[10:51:56] <shoky_> Sagar: because thats the result rotation
[10:52:24] <shoky_> so you can't get the individual transforms that make up the result transform
[10:54:27] <shoky_> indeed the top-left part of the matrix for your transform is just the identity matrix 1 0, 0 1   i.e. no rotation
[10:56:16] <Sagar> so how should we convert it or get it?
[10:56:34] <shoky_> <shoky_> so you can't get the individual transforms that make up the result transform
[10:56:34] <shoky_> :)
[10:57:25] <shoky_> (unless there's some hacky way of getting the actual value from the stylesheet, no idea)
[10:58:23] <taplar> i guess at this point i'm kinda concerned this is becoming an x y problem
[10:58:27] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[10:58:39] <patrickk> Hello, Is there a way to access a php variable in the ajax success function?
[10:58:59] <taplar> patrickk: can you elaborate more?
[10:59:11] <taplar> ajax runs in the client.  php runs on the server
[10:59:58] <Sagar> as far i know the matrix includes it
[11:00:04] <Sagar> so there should be a way out
[11:00:05] <patrickk> taplar: for example in the I use ajax to run a function, in that php function, I make a variable $foo (to be used for some other purpose, for example updating the cart count when product is added through ajax), how can I access $foo;
[11:00:23] <Sagar> i don't know how the matrix works
[11:00:26] <shoky_> Sagar: no the matrix does not include it
[11:00:27] <taplar> you return the value of $foo in the response
[11:00:37] <shoky_> Sagar: just like 0 doesn't include  125 or -125  :)
[11:00:53] <patrickk> taplar: there are other things also included in that reponse, like updating the cart dropdown with product info
[11:01:08] <patrickk> response even
[11:01:10] <taplar> so you'd use an associative array that gets returned as json
[11:01:16] <shoky_> Sagar: (and i do know how the matrix works ;p)
[11:01:38] <patrickk> hm ok
[11:02:08] <shoky_> e.g.  if you had  rotate(10deg) rotate(10deg) rotate(10deg)   that matrix would only contain the information for 30deg rotation,  not the individual 10 + 10 + 10 that made it up
[11:02:37] <taplar> but that 30deg rotation could have resulted from 6 5deg rotations also
[11:02:46] <taplar> if i'm understanding shoky correctly
[11:02:50] <shoky_> yep
[11:03:11] <shoky_> and 0 could've come from 125-125  or 5-5  or ... :p
[11:03:47] <shoky_> the fact that there was a rotation of 125 before and after the translations, affects the result translation
[11:03:51] <shoky_> but not the result rotation
[11:05:25] <taplar> thus my question of what the problem is.  regardless of how you got to the matrix that you have, you obviously want to change it somehow.
[11:05:26] <shoky_> (e.g. translate(10px,0)   has 0 translation in y-axis.  but:  rotate(90deg) translate(10px,0) rotate(-90deg)    has non-zero translation in y-axis
[11:05:27] <shoky_> )
[11:05:33] <taplar> which seems like you'd just apply the new rotation to it
[11:07:40] <tocka> hi guys, how can I count the total elements in a container?
[11:07:51] <tocka> Im using each() to go through all of them
[11:07:54] <taplar> regardless of depth?
[11:08:11] <tocka> taplar it will be only 1 level deep :)
[11:08:19] <taplar> do you care about text nodes?
[11:08:20] <tocka> i mean I need to count a certain class name
[11:08:22] <shoky_> if you have something to .each() on , then.. just .length on that :p
[11:08:30] <tocka> dang
[11:08:31] <tocka> ..
[11:08:33] <tocka> lets try it!
[11:08:44] <taplar> $(container).find('.theClass').length
[11:09:09] <tocka> yup
[11:09:11] <tocka> \o/
[11:09:13] <tocka> thanks
[11:09:13] <tocka> :)
[11:38:07] <Sagar> any way to take out the value of rotate inside    transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(90deg) translateY(-200px) rotate(-90deg);
[11:39:28] <taplar> we already covered this man
[11:39:41] <Sagar> i got the matrix value
[11:39:45] <Sagar> i want help with math to calcuate it
[11:39:56] <taplar> there is 0 rotation
[11:40:19] <taplar> 90deg - 90deg = 0
[11:42:47] <Sagar> so how do we take it out?
[11:43:54] <taplar> why take it out?
[11:44:00] <taplar> you've yet to say what the problem is
[11:44:18] <Sagar> i want to read and fech rotate values
[11:44:26] <Sagar> when i use $(element).css("transform")
[11:44:29] <taplar> as said by shoky, you can't get that
[11:44:29] <Sagar> i get matrix value
[11:44:53] <taplar> the matrix contains the result based on the css, but it does not contain the css that got it to that point
[11:45:07] <Sagar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21987596/get-css-transform-property-with-jquery
[11:46:08] <taplar> that's finding the transformY property
[11:47:52] <Sagar> yes, so that's what i am asking, if we can get transformY, we can get that too
[11:48:12] <shoky_> Sagar: there is a hacky way to do it if you want... won't work in all cases tho prolly.  https://stackoverflow.com/a/19404900/1098884
[11:49:42] <taplar> or just realize that the rotation is 0 and adjust it however you want.  you don't need to get the rotation to do that
[11:49:42] <shoky_> Sagar: https://jsfiddle.net/g0w87Lpy/  :p
[11:54:19] <Sagar> shoky_: since we have translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(90deg) translateY(-200px) rotate(-90deg) now, how to we remove and get only values?
[11:54:28] <shoky_> Sagar: with javascript :\
[11:54:39] <Sagar> the regex would be?
[11:54:45] <shoky_> dude. did you even try?
[11:55:33] <Sagar> string.replace(/[^A-Za-z()\-.,]/g, '').split(',')
[11:55:35] <Sagar> ?
[11:55:36] <shoky_> anyway, not jquery related ;p
[11:55:41] <shoky_> does it work
[11:55:41] <shoky_> ?
[11:55:44] <shoky_> if yes, yes. if no, no
[11:55:48] <shoky_> jeez
[11:57:35] <Sagar> :(
[12:23:37] <jquery168> Can I input html in a javascript object?
[12:24:10] <taplar> sure
[12:24:31] <taplar> though i'm kinda uncertain what you mean by 'input'
[12:24:36] <jquery168> Er, let me rephrase that, I'm not sure that's what I'm actually asking lol
[12:25:39] <jquery168> So I have a chat bot I'm building that allows users to click a button to submit their response, the responses are in a monolithic traversable object
[12:25:51] <jquery168> But I need to be able to swap out buttons for a text input
[12:26:50] <jquery168> So on my example, instead of it creating a "my certification" button, I'm trying to get an html field
[12:26:52] <jquery168> https://jsfiddle.net/vqudg33u/
[12:27:51] <taplar> this is all javascript
[12:28:10] <taplar> are you after a javascript solution, or a jQuery solution?
[12:28:25] <jquery168> I was going to swap over to jquery
[12:29:04] <taplar> ok, so where is the part with the issue?
[12:30:22] <jquery168> I'm not sure how I could replace the button, would I just want to run a .html() on my chatbutton div?
[12:30:51] <taplar> ideally you'd want to target the particular button you want to replace, and just replace it
[12:31:01] <taplar> which if there is only one would be giving it an id
[12:31:52] <jquery168> Well certain questions would replace all the buttons, but if I try to run js in the 'response:' it breaks the function
[12:33:05] <taplar> what do you mean js in the response?
[12:33:49] <jquery168> So if I run my function to replace the button, then try to get the answer of what they typed in the response, it breaks the function
[12:34:12] <taplar> can you show me that logic?
[12:35:51] <jquery168> one moment
[12:37:16] <jquery168> https://jsfiddle.net/vqudg33u/1/
[12:38:39] <taplar> so are you saying after you do question1 that things stop working?
[12:39:12] <taplar> i'm assuming so because you are completely rebuilding the elements in #buttons
[12:39:31] <taplar> any buttons that you had there before that you were attaching click events to, which i saw you doing, would no longer have those click bindings on them
[12:39:41] <jquery168> Well it's not even appending the textarea
[12:40:51] <taplar> open your console and then click that button
[12:42:59] <jquery168> Yeah thats because the second question references a1 which isn't in the example
[12:43:34] <jquery168> I'm just trying to find an easy way to swap out the responses with an input on certain questions
[12:43:50] <taplar> right, so i'm trying to see the issue, but the fiddle is breaking before it gets to your issue
[12:46:21] <jquery168> It should append an input instead of "my certification"
[12:47:01] <taplar> so get that fiddle working to the point that it shows your issue
[12:50:46] <Rockwood>     $("#login").submit(function(){
[12:50:46] <Rockwood>         
[12:50:46] <Rockwood>     });
[12:51:01] <Rockwood> is correct ?
[12:51:08] <taplar> what are you trying to do?
[12:51:19] <Rockwood> i am looking on submit event
[12:51:36] <taplar> then yes, though i would suggest using on('submit') instead
[12:52:54] <Rockwood> on('submit') is deprecated ? taplar
[12:53:01] <taplar> heavens no
[12:53:14] <taplar> submit(function) is a wrapper for on('submit', function)
[12:53:24] <taplar> https://j11y.io/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.fn.submit
[12:53:58] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/submit/ -> "This method is a shortcut for .on( "submit", handler ) in the first variation, and .trigger( "submit" ) in the third."
[12:57:24] <Rockwood> on('submit') is good compare than .submit(function(){}) ?
[12:58:25] <Rockwood> i wanna collect my all data of my form in one short ?
[12:58:59] <Rockwood> by serialized
[13:00:29] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood so then serilaize it?
[13:00:33] <robertmaxrees> whjat's the coinfusion?
[13:02:32] <Rockwood> all i got
[13:05:55] <Rockwood> http://viper-7.com/y3Arxh
[13:06:03] <Rockwood> _token=M1wYwO41UAADkRmI09oqeQn9YSqL82hEYJyNV2SL&email=sharmanitin21%40gmail.com&password=123456
[13:06:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:06:24] <Rockwood> sharmanitin21%40gmail.com  sending like this
[13:06:30] <taplar> you should pass in the event.  it's not global for all browsers
[13:06:34] <Rockwood> instead of
[13:06:59] <Rockwood> sharmanitin21@gmail.com
[13:07:05] <robertmaxrees> Rockwood if it's via a GET that's pretty standard...
[13:07:35] <Rockwood> means ?
[13:07:45] <taplar> it's being encoded
[13:07:51] <Rockwood> yes
[13:08:00] <Rockwood> but i wanna as it is
[13:08:04] <taplar> and your server should be able to handle the unencoding
[13:08:09] <Rockwood> @ should be @
[13:08:17] <taplar> why?
[13:08:52] <Rockwood> bcz i wanna verify this email id is persent in my database
[13:08:59] <taplar> so do that
[13:09:07] <taplar> like i said, the server should handle the unencoding
[13:09:08] <Rockwood> its converted
[13:09:25] <pavonia> Sending email and password via query parameters is plain wrong anyway, isn't it?
[13:09:34] <taplar> that too
[13:09:49] <taplar> well, you need https at least
[13:10:02] <taplar> but yeah in the url is odd
[13:10:36] <Rockwood> taplar, like ?? hows should pass them
[13:10:42] <taplar> post that request
[13:10:49] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:11:00] <taplar> so the fields are in the request body and can be protected by https
[13:11:01] <robertmaxrees> the post body won't get modified.
[13:11:46] <Rockwood> single single values
[13:11:59] <Rockwood> ?
[13:12:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:12:14] <robertmaxrees> you could post pretty much any format you wanted.  Like JSON.
[13:12:22] <Rockwood> yes
[13:12:31] <Rockwood> hows ?
[13:12:39] <robertmaxrees> or if you're not using ajax, the normal post body will work./
[13:12:44] <robertmaxrees> are you using ajax?
[13:13:11] <Rockwood> yes after data get i will be use ajax
[13:13:35] <robertmaxrees> then use $.ajax() and set the method to post
[13:13:38] <robertmaxrees> preetty basic stuff
[13:13:47] <Rockwood> okay
[13:13:57] <Rockwood> i got your point
[13:14:55] <Rockwood> type = post, data = $(this).serialize()
[13:14:59] <Rockwood> like this
[13:15:03] <Rockwood> ???
[13:15:48] <taplar> try and see
[13:16:01] <Rockwood> okay just sec
[13:16:02] <hhee> guys, send post data using jquery, in developer console dont see answer headers
[13:16:25] <taplar> 'answer headers' ?
[13:19:09] <hhee> taplar, well. yeah. i see header request, but in header response - there is running arrow
[13:19:30] <taplar> so the request is not ending then?
[13:20:20] <hhee> taplar, hm. i have .click event, and post on it. how can i end it?
[13:20:48] <taplar> you don't end the request.  the request ends when it ends.  if it is taking a long time for the request to finish, you should look into why that is
[13:22:06] <hhee> taplar, in developer tool show me post values, shiwh i send like - name:1 quantity:1  probably - server side  issues? there is $name=$_POST['name']; $quantity=$_POST['quantity']; echo "got $name and $quantity";
[13:22:24] <hhee> just for test right now
[13:22:57] <taplar> ok, so you said there is a 'running arrow' which made it sound like the request was not ending.  is that not the case?  are you getting a response code for the request?
[13:24:00] <hhee> jquery seems like - $.post("order.php",{ name: id, quantity: quantity},function(data, status){console.log("Data: " + data + "\nStatus: " + status);
[13:24:00] <hhee> });  wait i min, i'll check it
[13:24:15] <taplar> you can see the response code in the dev tools
[13:26:06] <hhee> taplar, without response code, gray circle
[13:26:19] <hhee> like there is no response code
[13:26:53] <taplar> so in your network tab you see the request, but there is no response code?
[13:27:15] <hhee> yep. without response code.
[13:27:21] <taplar> then that request is still running
[13:27:54] <hhee> taplar, got it. but... how to debug it.
[13:28:10] <hhee> looks like server side issue.
[13:28:17] <taplar> something on your backend is causing the request to not terminate as fast as you think.  you will need to debug there
[13:29:35] <hhee> taplar, server log show, POST /order.php HTTP/1.1" 200. well. dunno
[14:00:29] <bnason_> So apparently I have some bad click handler somewhere that is causing links with a target="_blank" to both open a new window and open in current window. but I can't seemt to find it.
[14:00:41] <bnason_> Is there anyway to break on all click events?
[14:09:29] <pavonia> bnason: Try https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2518421/jquery-find-events-handlers-registered-with-an-object/2518441#2518441 perhaps
[14:10:27] <bnason> yea that didnt work :(, or at least didnt help me find it
[14:10:32] <bnason> thanks though
[14:11:01] <sillyslux> you can look at registered click events in the according panel
[14:11:13] <bnason> they only show the line in the jquery file
[14:11:23] <sillyslux> oh
[14:12:48] <bnason> I did actually find it, by process of elimination. But man this should be easier heh
[14:21:40] <momomo> isn't translate3d(x,y,z) supposed to move the element to whatever those coordinates are? I am getting a move but it seems to be relative to the parent element
[14:21:46] <momomo> not using z btw ... but translate(x,y) wasn't working
[14:24:11] <taplar> sounds like a javascript/css question
[14:24:48] <momomo> taplar: yes, but the experts are not really there
[14:24:50] <momomo> :(
[14:25:24] <momomo> taplar: can you just confirm .. isn't transform:translate  supposed to parent inrelative? (not a word, i know)
[14:25:54] <taplar> i'm not really well informed on the transform css property
[14:34:50] <shoky> momomo: it translates it relative to wherever it was originally (with 0 translation). which could be relative to the parent, or not, depending on its 'position'
[14:39:42] <momomo> shoky: yes, i figured it out .. i need to calculate the difference between the to and move that much
[14:40:10] <momomo> too*
[15:16:38] <jquery048> I am using the users `msg` to collect their name, but now anytime they enter a message it thinks it a name, any ideas?
[15:25:13] <_geoff> I am using $.post('http://blah...', ...) but getting VM44:1 POST https://blah... net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED
[15:25:25] <_geoff> note, i am requesting http but it appears $.post converts to https?
[15:25:42] <_geoff> this is running via the console in the scope of a page running https
[15:26:03] <taplar> are you trying to go to a site other than the site you are on?
[15:26:07] <_geoff> yes
[15:26:12] <taplar> that's a CORS issue then
[15:26:32] <_geoff> aren't cors issues usually more explicit?
[15:26:43] <_geoff> that's actually why i was testing it like that
[15:26:44] <taplar> ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED is usually the error that i see
[15:26:50] <taplar> or is not uncommon
[15:27:16] <taplar> paired with ajax, it's always the first huntch, :)
[15:27:18] <_geoff> i usually see No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
[16:34:41] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[17:07:00] <jak2000> why not change: $("body").css("background-color", "blue !important");
[17:07:16] <jak2000> my body background color is white i want to change to blue...
[17:11:02] <taplar> seems like it doesn't like the important
[17:11:04] <pavonia> jak2000: Remove the "!important" part
[17:11:22] <jak2000> ok
[17:12:04] <sillyslux> seems like mine doesn't like the "-color" part... wtf
[17:12:29] <taplar> use camel case
[17:12:32] <taplar> it will convert it
[17:12:39] <sillyslux> nothing
[17:12:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/oLgwb6vb/
[17:13:10] <sillyslux> oh there
[17:13:24] <sillyslux> maybe i had the tab open for to long
[17:13:41] <sillyslux> sssstrange
[17:13:45] <jak2000> done
[18:34:33] <taplar> it's times like these that i wish i had some games on my phone
[18:34:49] <robertmaxrees> hah.  slow day?
[18:34:53] <taplar> super
[18:35:30] <taplar> i'm watching this room, S.O., another message board just waiting for something to happen before 18:00
[18:35:43] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[23:55:35] <jak2000> hi all
[23:55:50] <jak2000> if i define type="color" in wich event close the window?
