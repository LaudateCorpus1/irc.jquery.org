[03:17:25] <Abhijit> hi
[03:18:14] <Abhijit> how can i get device screen size which will be nearest to its specification e.g. 320x480px?
[03:24:48] <hassoon> $(document).width()
[03:25:26] <hassoon> $(document).height()
[03:26:23] <Abhijit> document and window gives me something on the line of 1117 for height and around 980 for width. on a 3.5" phone screen
[03:26:56] <hassoon> try another element
[03:27:01] <Abhijit> whats the "boundary" to decide if the given device is small, medium or large?
[03:27:20] <Abhijit> hassoon, tried container div and body. on the line of 1000 and 900

[07:53:19] <ashgotti> Hello all. I need a bit of help hiding elements on page load. I have it working when on input change but not page load. http://jsfiddle.net/67xd7zf9/ If you change "occupancy" to owner-occupied, you can see the elements hiding.
[08:01:59] <ashgotti> ah, of course 'this' isn't right.
[08:04:26] <ashgotti> Hmm.. how can I use 'this' with line 5? http://jsfiddle.net/67xd7zf9/
[08:05:02] <ashgotti> basically, on Load I want to check if a select list is set to a specific value and set hte closest instance of a class to hidden

[09:32:55] <Whirled> Hey all, I was wondering if I set the css transition properties on a class and then set the css value via jquery, will the transition happen?

[10:48:44] <mikunos> hi guys why the click doesn't work here: http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=Cbjv9SaI9r

[11:27:12] <rindolf> Hi all.
[12:16:16] <quackgyver> Holy shit
[12:16:26] <quackgyver> is there no way to scroll to an anchor with jQuery without using like
[12:16:29] <quackgyver> 10+ lines of code?
[12:16:33] <quackgyver> Seems completely insane to me.
[12:17:41] <rcyr> You can probably do it in 5.
[12:17:50] <quackgyver> :|
[12:18:17] <quackgyver> I thought jQuery was supposed to simplify these things and also allow you to do it in readable code
[12:19:11] <rcyr> Something like: var target = $('#target'); $('html, body').animate({ scrollTop: target.offset().top + px}, 250);
[12:19:33] <quackgyver> I did var element_to_scroll_to = document.getElementById("foo"); element_to_scroll_to.scrollIntoView();
[12:19:40] <rcyr> Err +'px'
[12:19:57] <rcyr> How is that 10 lines?
[12:20:15] <rcyr> Also, why are you using Vanilla DOM functions when you use jQuery?
[12:20:26] <quackgyver> Because it was the only simple solution I could find.
[12:20:31] <quackgyver> But it doesn't scroll smoothly obviously
[12:20:41] <quackgyver> Still, I prefer that over 10 lines of convoluted code
[12:20:42] <rcyr> Also, why the hell do you use snake case in JS?
[12:20:42] <rcyr> </unrelated)
[12:20:50] <quackgyver> Because it's copypasted
[13:31:31] <EGreg2> hey all
[13:31:38] <EGreg2> what smallest version of jquery supports the following syntax:
[13:31:44] <EGreg2> $('<div />', { properties } )
[13:33:08] <shoky> EGreg2: 1.4 according to http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-html-attributes
[13:57:06] <EGreg2> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20174955/requestanimationframe-not-working-in-safari-opera-tearing-my-hair-out
[13:57:18] <EGreg2> What's going on? I am calling requestAnimationFrame (the native one) and it doesn't call the callback ever
[13:57:19] <EGreg2> in iOS safari
[13:57:31] <EGreg2> sometimes it does, but then it hits a state where it doesn't
[13:57:44] <EGreg2> and yes, window.requestAnimationFrame is still the [native] implementation
[14:05:44] <EGreg2> what can cause this behavior?
[15:41:03] <lakitu> i am editing this lightbox gallery for my own use: http://www.no-margin-for-errors.com/projects/prettyphoto-jquery-lightbox-clone/#prettyPhoto[pp_gal]/0/         any ideas what i could change here to get the close button in the corner of the page? here's the plugin CSS: http://pastebin.ca/3032956 & the plugin js: http://pastebin.ca/3032959    relevant ctrl+f text is "pp_close" (the close button), & it's in a tight container
[15:42:02] <lakitu> just probably need to make a conatainer/div for the close button, & position it with css.  with my programming knowledge, that is, that's what i think needs to be done
[15:42:15] <lakitu> i tried that & it didn't work
[15:42:47] <lakitu> (probably due to my lack of understanding)
[15:44:08] <lakitu> container*
[16:44:48] <Razerglass> i have a div with a ton of <p>blahblah</p>  is it possible to do something like $('#div p').click to but a click listener on EACH p?
[16:45:18] <Razerglass> $('#listDiV p').click(function(){
[16:45:18] <Razerglass>   console.log($(this).html());
[16:45:18] <Razerglass> });
[16:49:42] <Razerglass> i guess a simplier question is: could i make 50 click event listeners, for each <p> in my div... or should I make a click listener that listenrs to the div's <p> elements?
[16:50:25] <rcyr> Razerglass: You use event delegation
[16:50:38] <rcyr> $('#listDiV').on('click', 'p', function(event) { .... });
[16:51:03] <Razerglass> woah interesting, what exactly is that extra argument 'p' do exactly
[16:51:07] <rcyr> So you only have a single event handler no matter how many <p> you have inside that div
[16:52:17] <Razerglass> rcyr that is perfect, thanks!
[16:52:29] <rcyr> It will attach a single handler to '#listDiV' that will listen to events that happen on 'p's
[16:52:40] <rcyr> It works because of "event bubbling"
[19:45:46] <acidjazz> dong bubbling

[20:18:24] <Axy> hey all
[20:18:25] <Axy> how can I get the text in an object, without getting the text in the children elements it contains?
[20:22:32] <joe9_> What is the cdn name for the jquery.simulate.js library. I read that using the raw github file is not a good idea.
[20:25:04] <Woet> what makes you think there is a cdn that's distributing it?
[20:25:49] <Axy> how can I get the text in an object, without getting the text in the children elements it contains?
[20:32:11] <joe9_> Woet: Was that question meant for me?
[20:32:17] <Woet> joe9_: yes.
[20:32:42] <joe9_> Woet: I read that rawgithub added the nosniff header and that it is causing issues with browsers.
[20:33:06] <joe9_> Woet: Hence, want to check for the proper way to reference the script.
[20:33:19] <Woet> joe9_: yes, i didn't disagree with that.
[20:33:23] <Woet> joe9_: upload it to your server.
[20:33:45] <joe9_> Woet: I do not have a server. I am planning on using it in a greasemonkey script
[20:33:58] <Woet> joe9_: then you have an issue.
