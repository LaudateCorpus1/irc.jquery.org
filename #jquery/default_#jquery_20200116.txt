[06:42:20] <morenoh11> I have a link doing this https://stackoverflow.com/a/13626348/630752 but the spinner doesn't display. Any idea why?
[07:12:18] <morenoh11> seems to work if I delay by 1000ms
[07:14:17] <Cork> most browsers stop javascript and rendering when it changes the url
[07:14:49] <Cork> also might be worth checking what happens if you use a throbber that isn't an images (so no load dealy)
[07:15:37] <Cork> but ya, doing things just as the page unloads is often tricky
[07:15:37] <morenoh11> its more like this https://dpaste.org/31E1
[07:16:30] <Cork> morenoh11: and if you don't do the setTimeout it doesn't render you mean?
[07:16:39] <morenoh11> replaceWith is sync? not worth promisifying it and doing the navigation in a callback or .then()?
[07:17:19] <Cork> please answer the question
[07:17:34] <morenoh11> nope, not enough time to mutate the dom
[07:17:43] <Cork> no, that isn't what happens
[07:17:49] <morenoh11> setTimeout 0ms also is not enough time
[07:17:58] <Cork> it changes the dom, but the browser only renders the page when js has stopped
[07:18:14] <Cork> so js has to exit for the rendering to happen
[07:18:29] <Cork> and that is why the change isn't visible unless you have the setTimeout
[07:18:39] <Cork> and rendering isn't observable in js
[07:19:19] <Cork> something you can try is requestAnimationFrame
[07:19:37] <Cork> that will execute as soon as a frame is queued for rendering
[07:20:00] <Cork> and inseide that a simple setTimeout(function() {}) should be enough to get the correct location to run
[07:22:56] <Cork> so, try https://jsfiddle.net/Laeb1t5p/
[09:16:06] <hu553in> Hi all! I need help with jQuery UI. I have trouble that I can't solve for much time. Can I ask that question here?
[09:16:28] <Cork> sure
[09:35:23] <hu553in> Okay, thanks.
[09:35:24] <hu553in> I have several draggable elements (will call them "items") and droppable container for them.
[09:35:24] <hu553in> Initially, items are outside the container.
[09:35:24] <hu553in> After moving some item and dropping it into container, I re-call it's .draggable() function with some new options.
[09:35:24] <hu553in> Also, I call .resizable() function to make my item resizable.
[09:35:25] <hu553in> Here's my trouble: .resizable() creates '.ui-wrapper' around my item.
[09:35:27] <hu553in> It's size = item size.
[09:35:29] <hu553in> After that, I can't move my item - it's moving restricted by wrapper "walls".
[09:35:33] <hu553in> How can I make my item draggable and resizable?
[09:35:35] <hu553in> Tried to find smth on Web, have no results :(
[09:35:37] <hu553in> Fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/hu553in/wos7xdf6/2/
[09:35:39] <hu553in> Needed code places are commented.
[09:35:41] <hu553in> Thanks.
[09:35:43] <hu553in> p.s. Sorry for language, I'm not native speaker, just learning English

[18:03:18] <grid-> hey
[18:03:56] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[18:04:17] <grid-> robert :)
[18:04:52] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:05:13] <grid-> you helped me a while ago you remember? with a function to detect the column title according to an index :)
[18:05:36] <robertmaxrees> not really.  what can we help you with today?
[18:05:47] <grid-> i'm now on vacation, you left after you helped me, but i fixed it a while ago
[18:05:57] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:07:08] <grid-> how you doing?
[18:07:19] <robertmaxrees> uh, alright I suppose?
[18:09:05] <grid-> ok good, this is the fiddle that's been used that time: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dyr2z14g/ :)
[18:09:22] <robertmaxrees> okay.  did you have a question?
[18:10:07] <grid-> nope, as i said it's fixed now, i added a second function to it to detect the value of the nearest specific column title, that was country i believe
[18:11:05] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[18:12:05] <robertmaxrees> lol i have a dayjob, do a bunch of stuff in my downtime, and help people here and in a few other places.  not going to remember every little interaction or every person i help :shrug:
[18:12:38] <grid-> do you work at build.com? as i saw that in the fiddle i believe :)
[18:13:00] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:12:55] <grid-> goodnight
