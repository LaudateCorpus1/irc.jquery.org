[01:42:08] <raj> is using twitter bs with jqui a bad idea?
[02:25:50] <aabbccsmith> Hi there, newbie here. How can I use jquery to create a responsive design? This is my code: https://codeshare.io/a3yk3z
[02:30:36] <aabbccsmith> Hello?
[04:40:10] <Jacquie> Guys i got a calla
[04:41:30] <Jacquie> Guys i got a callback for a select event where i call the same event with a method to resize the calendar period (line 36 to 60)
[04:42:09] <Jacquie> https://thepasteb.in/p/BghPjG4RZk9SY
[04:42:45] <Jacquie> The problem is that i cant send my jsEvent to the new callback on line 46
[04:43:45] <Jacquie> so as it recalls the handleSelect on line95 i set jsEvent.pageX Y to undefined as jsEvent is undefined
[05:01:30] <Jacquie> Guys how do i pass my jsEvent to the new select event method on line 46 ?

[07:28:41] <senaps> hi, usining this code, i can successfully POST my form. but immedietly after submit, the page turn's white and i get json result. how can send over the result to this flask engine?  https://jsfiddle.net/fc6rszf8/
[08:00:07] <raj> senaps, that depends on what your server is returning
[08:00:41] <raj> are you getting the "alert('server says')"?
[08:01:10] <senaps> raj, i have tried both json and plain text. now i have fixed the problem by the way. just deleted my code and wrote it again a bit cleaner!
[08:01:30] <raj> k
[08:01:36] <senaps> yup. thanks
[08:27:10] <Kartagis> why is $.ajax({url:"http://7.webcinizim.com/services/submission",type:"post",dataType:"json",contentType:"application/json",data:{"isim":"Tolga"},function(r){console.log(r)}}) throwing Invalid JSON?
[08:29:54] <shoky_> Kartagis:  you set contentType to application/json  but you are not sending json
[08:30:20] <shoky_> Kartagis: also maybe the response is not valid JSON, donno :p
[08:30:42] <Kartagis> shoky_: I thought {"isim":"Tolga} /was/ JSON
[08:31:00] <Kartagis> shoky_: I thought {"isim":"Tolga"} /was/ JSON*
[08:31:34] <shoky_> Kartagis:  it's not, it's a javascript object.  JSON is a textual format
[08:31:42] <shoky_> Kartagis:  you want to JSON.stringify the object
[08:32:25] <Kartagis> JSON.stringify("isim":"Tolga")?
[08:32:29] * Kartagis runs
[08:32:44] <shoky_> Kartagis:  stringify the object.   {....}  is the object :p
[08:33:17] <shoky_> what you wrote is not valid JS
[08:33:35] <Kartagis> sorry, I meant JSON.stringify({"isim":"Tolga"})
[08:33:42] <shoky_> yap
[08:33:44] * Kartagis hides
[08:33:49] <Kartagis> okay, thanks
[08:35:43] <Kartagis> shoky_: I got back "missing required argument". does this mean it's supposed to be in data?
[08:36:47] <shoky_> Kartagis: that's the server telling you that your request is missing an argument, i guess?  you'll have to read their API docs? or ask them :)
[08:50:21] <Kartagis> okay I was able to post a submission. but the argument was supposed to be webform, not uuid as mentioned in the error. and I was also able to post the key, not the value
[10:25:52] <Eliran_Arbel> Hey ia it possible to make a lightbox gallery using strictly php?
[10:26:46] <zotherstupidguy> hi jquery
[10:26:52] <zotherstupidguy> anyone got xp with selectize.js?
[10:46:58] <Kartagis> what am I doing wrong with $.ajax({url:"http://7.webcinizim.com/services/submission",type:"post",dataType:"json",contentType:"application/json",data:JSON.stringify({"webform":"9afdd715-9c0d-46e7-b569-412a9cd8fcba","submission":{"isim":"Tolga"}}),function(r){console.log(r)}})?
[11:07:48] <michel__> which jquery translation modue should i use to translate the webpages in our intranet system?
[11:08:40] <michel__> which jquery translation module should i use to translate the webpages in our intranet system?
[11:17:00] <woodrag> which jquery translation module is currently the best choice?
[12:56:01] <r3v3rb> okay, aif element 'A' is hidden by default and then fading in element 'A' later would fire 'A's on('click') event?
[12:57:16] <robertmaxrees> the fade wouldn't do that, no.
[12:58:00] <r3v3rb> robertmaxrees, but for some reason, when the element fades in it is firing that elements 'on(click)' handler
[12:58:25] <robertmaxrees> what's the code you're using to fade it in?
[13:00:10] <r3v3rb> robertmaxrees, https://gist.github.com/anonymous/0c710bca5bcaaa3e60e4a6c4bdb2c6b7
[13:00:26] <robertmaxrees> oh, heh
[13:00:30] <robertmaxrees> bad idea there.
[13:00:32] <r3v3rb> excuse the formatting github messed with the tabs ;)
[13:00:50] <r3v3rb> why's that?
[13:00:51] <robertmaxrees> every time you click $('div.well').on('click', function () {, it's adding another handler for $('input.search').on('click', function (e) {
[13:01:16] <r3v3rb> it is? why would that happen?
[13:01:28] <robertmaxrees> because you're addiung another handler.
[13:01:31] <robertmaxrees> they "Stack".
[13:01:36] <robertmaxrees> they don't replace them.
[13:02:12] <r3v3rb> so how should I handle the 'click' on the '.well' to not add another handler?
[13:02:35] <robertmaxrees> you move the .search handler outside of the .well handler.
[13:02:45] <r3v3rb> it is
[13:02:56] <r3v3rb> github added extra tabs...
[13:02:59] <robertmaxrees> ah, indentation tripped me up.
[13:02:59] <robertmaxrees> sec.
[13:03:17] <r3v3rb> np ;)
[13:03:26] <robertmaxrees> there were extra closing }), as well.
[13:04:03] <r3v3rb> sure thats the $(doc) closing tag got copy/paste by accident
[13:04:05] <r3v3rb> sorry
[13:04:36] <robertmaxrees> so is it the handler for .search getting fired again, then?
[13:05:28] <r3v3rb> as soon as the fadein finishes yes
[13:06:05] <woodrag> Is there a jquery language translation module available which can be recommended ?
[13:06:23] <robertmaxrees> woodrag "jquery language translation module"?  could you clarify?
[13:06:35] <r3v3rb> robertmaxrees, i'm lost - I just don't get why it would happen
[13:07:28] <robertmaxrees> r3v3rb i'm not seeing anything that should cause that to happen.  can you make a fiddle that shows it?
[13:08:35] <robertmaxrees> you can likely skip the ajax stuff and just pop in the aniamtions.
[13:08:54] <jqueryQs> What's the reasoning behind some one using on click like this: $("some_id").on("click","id class",function()
[13:09:12] <woodrag> robertmaxrees: i  am looking/searching a simple module that can be used to translate webpages from english to spanish and other languages...
[13:09:15] <robertmaxrees> jqueryQs that's called delegation.
[13:09:29] <robertmaxrees> woodrag doesn't google give you a service to do that?
[13:10:17] <robertmaxrees> jqueryQs the idea is $('parent').on('click', 'child', function() {}) - you use it when the child element is dynamically added.
[13:10:44] <jqueryQs> what if the parent element is dynamically added too?
[13:10:44] <robertmaxrees> or you have a lot of that element and only want one handler.  it's also handy when yoiu want to decouple your logic from your html.
[13:10:49] <woodrag> robertmaxrees: we want to use our own dictionairies
[13:10:59] <robertmaxrees> then that isn't terribly helpful jqueryQs
[13:11:08] <robertmaxrees> woodrag i would't suggest jquery for something like that then.,
[13:11:38] <woodrag> robertmaxrees: any other suggestions?
[13:12:57] <robertmaxrees> woodrag i'd look into an internationalization library.  i'd look for a server-side i18n libraryu.
[13:12:59] <robertmaxrees> *library
[13:13:50] <robertmaxrees> woodrag sadly, there's nothing that's going to be necessarily "simple" if what you want is custom translation.
[13:14:21] <woodrag> robertmaxrees: thank you for you response!
[13:14:27] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[13:23:20] <r3v3rb> robertmaxrees, could it be jquery-ui firing the submit?
[13:23:43] <r3v3rb> just stripped out that from the fiddle and it doesn't fire the submit field
[13:23:45] <robertmaxrees> r3v3rb fadeIn shouldn't cause that - have you tried commenting that part out and seeing if it still fires?
[13:24:27] <r3v3rb> robertmaxrees, ui is doing an autocomplete on the text field so I wonder if that automatically submits the form for each character
[13:24:44] <robertmaxrees> could be.  i'd have to see it tbnh.
[13:26:03] <r3v3rb> sure, its not on the 'net yet just my vagrant box so hard to show you
[13:26:19] <robertmaxrees> you said you have a fiddle >.>
[13:26:27] <r3v3rb> and fiddle works without the autocomplete :)
[13:26:40] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing the fiddle?
[13:27:32] <r3v3rb> so I'm /msg robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/ca1a711a/
[13:27:37] <r3v3rb> doh :)
[13:27:39] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:27:43] <r3v3rb> haha
[13:27:44] <robertmaxrees> no need to PM it :)
[13:27:55] <r3v3rb> obviously now :D
[13:28:03] <robertmaxrees> wait bootstrap or JQUI?
[13:29:02] <robertmaxrees> also: add in the code that breaks.
[13:29:08] <robertmaxrees> even if the ajax doesn't work./
[13:29:12] <r3v3rb> ok
[13:34:54] <r3v3rb> robertmaxrees, without the ajax function working the autocomplete doesn't do anything in the fiddle
[13:35:03] <r3v3rb> so it stays quiet
[13:36:39] <robertmaxrees> we can try to fix that aprt.
[13:36:43] <robertmaxrees> no need to PM me, yo.
[13:36:48] <robertmaxrees> keep in in channel pls :)
[13:39:23] <r3v3rb> okay, sorry :/
[13:42:16] <r3v3rb> arhh, i have a feeling it was a browser cache issue! it appears to be working after reopening the browser and clearing everything... sorry robertmaxrees
[13:48:31] <phelix> So I am trying to do some form validation. If an input field is left blank I simply just want it to display an alert() I have this working. However the input field is using ajax call for auto complete. So if I type 8 letters in the box before selecting my item and hit go. I will receive the alert window 8+ times. Anyone know what might be happening and how I can avoid this?
[13:48:50] <robertmaxrees> can you share your code phelix?
[13:49:01] <robertmaxrees> r3v3rb ah.  funky.
[13:53:18] <phelix> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/hnz86eqv/ wont be possible to get it to work because will need to be in its environment. but this is the HTML and related js
[13:53:55] <phelix> I have found out that its related to the autocomplete. More letters I type before clicking go determines how many times I receive that alert window.
[13:54:08] <robertmaxrees> what calls bindTravelFormValidation ?
[13:55:04] <phelix> Drupal.behaviors.aaa_book_travel_autocomplete = { attach: function(context, settings) { bindTravelFormValidation(); }
[13:55:15] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't really mean much to me :/
[13:55:27] <robertmaxrees> does that only get called once on pageload?
[13:55:31] <phelix> yes
[13:55:46] <robertmaxrees> so you only ever see "TEST" once in your console?
[13:55:50] <phelix> yup
[13:56:39] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you try https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hnz86eqv/1/ ?
[13:56:52] <robertmaxrees> just bind the handler directly.
[13:58:11] <phelix> i tried that by just pulling it out of a function. But let me test again
[13:59:05] <robertmaxrees> the only way that code would fire multiple times is if either that handler or that init function were getting called multiple times.
[13:59:53] <phelix> Yea, weird part is that its tied to the autocomplete.. So it checks destination and origin field. So if I type 5 letters for autocomplete on the destination field. and hit go I will receive 5 alert messages for the origin field.
[14:00:46] <robertmaxrees> what does Drupal.attachBehaviors(); do?
[14:01:31] <phelix> basically just binds it to the rest of all the drupal js functionality
[14:02:08] <robertmaxrees> sooo
[14:02:51] <robertmaxrees> hjeh
[14:03:02] <robertmaxrees> anything within  Drupal.behaviors gets run again?
[14:03:17] <phelix> no, only is called a single time
[14:03:27] <robertmaxrees> you just said " basically just binds it to the rest of all the drupal js functionality"
[14:03:36] <robertmaxrees> try commenting that line out and see if it fixes the issue
[14:03:46] <phelix> ok
[14:07:38] <robertmaxrees> and?
[14:07:46] <phelix> testing. Let ya know in a min
[14:10:30] <phelix> hmm, seems that it doesn't detect my .click function not putting it inside this Drupa.behaviors
[14:10:42] <robertmaxrees> so now it doesn't happen at all?
[14:10:46] <phelix> nope
[14:10:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:10:51] <phelix> but I can see the console.log
[14:10:54] <robertmaxrees> so it was getting bound more than once./
[14:11:09] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need a delegated listener for that instead.
[14:11:21] <phelix> hmm
[14:11:50] <robertmaxrees> wait you said you're getting the console.log when you click?
[14:12:01] <phelix> not in click. Just on page load
[14:12:08] <robertmaxrees> the console.log('blah', $('input#edit-pickuplocation').val()); ?
[14:12:10] <phelix> I have it right outside.
[14:12:12] <phelix> nope I don't see that
[14:12:42] <robertmaxrees> is this dynamically loaded?
[14:12:52] <phelix> Yea, this script is only loaded on this page.
[14:12:54] <robertmaxrees> and/or is your code in a doc ready or anything like that?
[14:13:00] <robertmaxrees> I meant the html.
[14:13:13] <phelix> (function($, Drupal) {
[14:13:20] <robertmaxrees> that's not a document ready.
[14:13:22] <phelix> No the html is static.
[14:13:28] <phelix> no its not in a doc read
[14:13:36] <robertmaxrees> and it's before the html I assume?
[14:13:39] <robertmaxrees> not at the end of the body?
[14:13:53] <phelix> yes the script is called inside the <head>
[14:13:58] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[14:14:01] <robertmaxrees> need a doc ready on there.
[14:14:14] <phelix> hmm, ok let me give that a whirl.
[14:14:23] <robertmaxrees> somnething like https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hnz86eqv/2/
[14:33:30] <phelix> hmm, doesn't appear you are able to do this. All js needs to be inside the behaviors or nothing seems to work
[14:33:55] <robertmaxrees> then you can't really call to reinit the behaviors.
[14:34:10] <phelix> Why do you think that its related to the autocomplete field?
[14:34:30] <robertmaxrees> when did I say it was?
[14:34:55] <robertmaxrees> I said it was likely a side effect of you calling Drupal.attachBehaviors();
[14:35:13] <robertmaxrees> which happens to be in the success handler for the ajax call you're using in autocomplete.
[14:35:20] <phelix> and its for the opposite item. So I have that validation for the destination and origin. So I add a text to origin and if i type 4 letters into that field when I get the alert for the destination
[14:35:31] <phelix> no I was the one that said it was related to autocomplete not you
[14:35:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:35:50] <robertmaxrees> why did you ask why I thought as much then?
[14:36:04] <robertmaxrees> either way, that particular function call is your issue.
[14:36:05] <phelix> i dunno lol
[14:36:30] <phelix> You have any ideas for a work around?
[14:37:45] <robertmaxrees> sure - use a delegated handler inside the original version and then don't call Drupal.attachBehaviors();
[14:38:02] <phelix> Drupal Behaviors. It's basically a wrapper for jQuery.ready() that uses jQuery.once(). It's good practice to use it, and it also gives you context and settings variables. Context is either the document element or, when you are in forms for example and the js is added using #attached, its the form object for instance. It's useful to optimize selectors, so you can do $('#foo', context) and you can search against the context. :)
[14:38:08] <phelix> some info about Drupal Behaviors
[14:38:19] <robertmaxrees> that statement isn't true.
[14:38:26] <robertmaxrees> at least with the way you're using it.
[14:39:01] <robertmaxrees> the handler itself might use .once(), but any handlers bound inside of it will use it more than once.
[14:39:15] <robertmaxrees> so .on() doesn't magically change tghere.  it does what it always does, basically.
[14:39:26] <phelix> hmm
[14:41:39] <phelix> So you think by having to use drupa.behaviors its not possible to make this work?
[14:41:47] <robertmaxrees> ...
[14:41:49] <robertmaxrees> i didn't say that.
[14:42:13] <robertmaxrees> i said you need to bind a delegated listener there and then not call that init method again./
[14:42:30] <phelix> ahh ok
[14:50:13] <tables> https://paste2.org/HA0XyjUx <-- why doesn't this code work?
[14:50:25] <tables> do i need some loader function in jquery?
[14:50:51] <tables> the background won't change

[14:52:47] <robertmaxrees> gotta learn how to fix ytourself duder :)
[14:52:49] <tables> oh nevermind just put js at the end, ok
[14:52:54] <robertmaxrees> or use a doc ready.
[14:52:57] <robertmaxrees> doc ready is poretty easy.

[14:59:27] <robertmaxrees> former.
[14:59:28] <Ice_Strike> Both work.

[15:00:16] <Ice_Strike> Sure :)

[15:03:05] <robertmaxrees> daegontaven sure - use two different tags and hide one.

[16:23:09] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:29:43] <MikeD_> haha
[16:31:03] <MikeD_> i read that as "whelp" and thought you were calling him "a young mammal of certain carnivorous species, notably canine pup, bear - or lion cub; human youngster,"
[16:31:12] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:57:39] <MikeD_> is the ctrlKey property only valued on a mouse event?
[16:58:12] <robertmaxrees> on the event object?
[16:58:39] <MikeD_> yeah i thought it was easy and it's not being easy
[16:58:44] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/ctrlKey
[16:58:47] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TouchEvent/ctrlKey
[16:58:54] <robertmaxrees> available on keyboard and touch, too.
[16:59:43] <MikeD_> keypress vs key[up|down]  - i should go home
[16:59:57] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:00:08] <robertmaxrees> the event object should still have it.
[17:00:10] <robertmaxrees> could be wrong though.
[17:01:30] <MikeD_> i swapped the event to keydown and got the behavior i was expecting
[17:01:38] <robertmaxrees> interesting.
[17:02:01] <MikeD_> i know, update your expectation ... :p
[17:05:03] <MikeD_> g'night
[17:05:07] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.,
[19:54:30] <Stragler> Hey guys. I have this fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/9540eq04/ But it is not greatly engineered… Does anyone have any suggestions on how to improve it? For example, the slider breaks if you press the buttons too fast.
[19:56:03] <robertmaxrees> you mean the lack of code reuse?
[19:59:58] <robertmaxrees> Stragler
[20:00:57] <Stragler> robertmaxrees: Yes I suppose that is an issue. Is that the source of why it breaks if you click the buttons too fast?
[20:01:04] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[20:01:15] <robertmaxrees> that's because animate queues up a bunch of animations at once.
[20:01:50] <robertmaxrees> so for starters, you're repeating the same code a lot.
[20:02:13] <robertmaxrees> I'd change your handlers and those slide functions to detect a class or something and then change the specific vars you need to change.
[20:02:44] <robertmaxrees> also look into using .stop() on animated elements when you click something.  or ignoring clicks while animations are running.
