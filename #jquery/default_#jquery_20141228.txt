[02:43:26] <Greves> seem to be having trouble using $.getJSON
[02:44:41] <Greves> i'm trying to read from a django rest API to make an ember app, and $.getJSON('localhost:8000/myapp/api/stuff).then(function(data){return data;}) is empty, but localhost:8000/myapp/api/stuff returns the correct JSON if i visit it directly in the browser
[03:20:09] <Tamwyn> Hey there, anyone here on the 31c3 and able to help me with some issues with a form and submitting via ajax?
[03:36:03] <Greves> how do i debug this jquery .getJSON request
[03:36:09] <Greves> i can't understand why it's not working
[03:39:02] <joroc> got code example?
[03:40:47] <Greves> https://bpaste.net/show/17c8fc6dfae9
[03:41:38] <Greves> so if i visit that URL it gives me the correct JSON, but when i run this page the response is empty when i check the network tab in chrome developer tool
[03:45:48] <Greves> any idea?
[03:47:40] <Greves> ok i'm just trying it in a blank file now with no other code, and its the same problem. $.getJSON(url) returns no response
[03:50:00] <Tamwyn> Hey there, can anyone help me with some issues with a form and submitting via ajax?
[03:52:36] <Tamwyn> I don't know why, but the browser seems to ignore the js code and is just refreshing the page
[03:54:02] <Tamwyn> I added some console.logs but the .submit(function(event) {...} is never executed
[04:20:18] <Tamwyn> exit
[05:59:21] <helge> Where can I get help, free or paid, about jQuery plugins and configuration? I've been stuck with a problem for 9 days now, which somebody else might have solved in three minutes.
[06:00:47] <wa5ted> helge: typically you wanna go to the repo location of the plugin and possibly file an issue
[06:01:00] <wa5ted> but if its general enough you could ask here what plugin it is specifically
[06:04:35] <helge> I do not understand how the serialize() function works.
[06:04:55] <helge> sorry, I meant sortable()
[06:05:12] <helge> I have posted a question on stackoverflow now. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27676904
[06:05:16] <helge> describing the issue.
[06:50:12] <shoky> helge: this gets you an array with the ids:  $('.sorted_table > tbody > tr').map(function() { return this.id }).get()
[06:54:09] <helge> thanks, shoky! one question, and sorry for being a total newbie, where does return this.id return a value?
[06:55:06] <shoky> helge: .map builds an array (or jquery collection in this case) out of whatever you return there
[06:55:54] <helge> do I need to assign that array to a value, like var data = this.id ?
[06:56:28] <helge> because I want to post the array to a php script
[06:56:44] <shoky> helge: this.id is not an array, it's just one of the id's.  you need to assign the result of the whole thing if you want to refer to it and send it somewhere, sure
[06:56:45] <helge> which stores it into a mysql database
[06:57:00] <shoky> helge: i answered your SO question with an example
[06:57:29] <helge> ah, thanks shoky! :)
[06:57:35] <shoky> np ;]
[07:01:33] <helge> shoky: one problem. when onDrop gets defined, the dragged tr won't go back into the table. it just stays wherever i put it, and the other rows in the table doesn't give room for the dragged element.
[07:01:43] <helge> and the array worked like a charm.
[07:03:57] <shoky> helge: looks like you might need to call some _super crap in the onDrop, at least their examples show it.. i updated the SO snippet
[07:04:59] <helge> yes!
[07:05:25] <helge> thank you, shaky! :-)
[07:36:58] <frabblerock> hey guys so quick prob simple question, I have images that are being loaded in server side through handlebars templates
[07:37:08] <frabblerock> if there is no image it'll have an image tag with src
[07:37:18] <frabblerock> so it'll look like this <img src />
[07:37:41] <frabblerock> how do i check if the attribute is empty or undefined in jquery if the output is not src=""
[07:49:14] <mikunos> hi guys I need to integrate the CKeditor to my page but I can see few buttons. This is my configuration: http://snipet.co.uk/LcH where I wrong?
[07:49:51] <mikunos> If I set Full nothing change!
[07:52:51] <mikunos> any hint?
[07:53:24] <Paradisee_> http://jsfiddle.net/1us5n3pu/1/ what's wrong with it?
[08:39:10] <axilla> can anyone tell me why this jquery function would work when calling it from document.ready but not when calling it from a  namespace? https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/68691f56734259e4da29
[08:40:10] <Paradisee_> why when i try to slide one of the 2 slider the value change only on the second one? http://jsfiddle.net/1us5n3pu/1/
[08:41:23] <Tawre> so i need to create a build script
[08:41:25] <Paradisee_> http://jsfiddle.net/1us5n3pu/2/
[08:42:08] <Tawre> it needs to convert images and possibly sound to base64, put it in the proper places, package the files (append them with names)
[08:42:21] <Tawre> and do a bunch of other stuff like it - any recommendations? i'm currently looking at grunt
[08:44:18] <numproc> axilla: there is a logic problem
[08:44:30] <_rgn> Tawre: grunt probably isn't going to be useful unless it provides a ready made plugin for thta
[08:46:18] <Tawre> _rgn, yeah but i could put the tasks in there right?
[08:46:30] <Tawre> the base64 conversion isn't a big deal i hope
[08:46:45] <Tawre> i'm just not sure how i'm going to approach appending files so i can squish the entire project into one; i'm currently using requirejs
[08:46:57] <_rgn> browserify?
[08:47:22] <Tawre> yeah but then i'd have to rchange the structure of the entire project
[08:47:29] <Tawre> or rethink it since i dont think it'd just work
[08:48:46] <numproc> axilla: http://jsfiddle.net/wg03fsfm/1/
[08:55:52] <axilla> eh, i've done it this way in rails 3 for years..
[08:56:03] <axilla> doesn't seem to work in rails 4 though
[08:57:51] <axilla> i shouldn't have to call init like that
[08:57:56] <axilla> rails automatically calls it.
[09:08:30] <Paradisee_> i cant figure out why do each slider change the last value and not their own: http://jsfiddle.net/1us5n3pu/4/ any suggestion?
[09:11:34] <shoky> Paradisee_: because the for loop has completed long before the "slide" callback function is called. so "value_id" has the last value it got in the loop
[09:11:58] <Paradisee_> dont get you
[09:12:32] <Paradisee_> ah ok...and how to i fix that
[09:12:35] <Paradisee_> do*
[09:12:39] <shoky> Paradisee_: value_id is not scoped to inside the for loop
[09:13:02] <Paradisee_> ok
[09:13:49] <Paradisee_> so i have to put this:
[09:13:50] <Paradisee_> $('#'+value_id).val($('#'+slider_id).slider('value'));
[09:13:55] <Paradisee_> outside the for loop
[09:14:06] <Paradisee_> but, how do i call it with the proper id
[09:15:21] <shoky> Paradisee_: by giving it a scope, by putting it inside a function. this is one way.. http://jsfiddle.net/1us5n3pu/5/
[09:16:25] <shoky> Paradisee_: but you don't need the ids here at all.  http://jsfiddle.net/1us5n3pu/6/
[09:17:05] <Paradisee_> ok lemme check ty
[09:18:29] <Paradisee_> amazing
[09:20:28] <jedrek> i'm looking for a way to upload an image file to the browser and displaying it without saving it
[10:03:49] <Mushr00m2> Hi I have an error with Draggable + Sortable since new UI update : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27679111/jquery-draggable-sortable-issue-with-container-relative
[10:18:14] <Paradisee_> how can i make those integers, decimal values? http://jsfiddle.net/1us5n3pu/11/
[10:18:32] <Paradisee_> i added a step: 0.1 but im not able to display the right value

[11:09:21] <xpheres> there's no way I can send a textarea by get
[11:09:24] <xpheres> this is the jquery
[11:09:27] <xpheres> http://lingoworld.eu/lingoworld/translator/jquery/contact_me.js
[11:09:58] <xpheres> the frontend with the contact form is here: http://lingoworld.eu/lingoworld/translator/translator.html
[11:11:28] <xpheres> it sends every input but no the textarea
[11:11:32] <xpheres> what's wrong?
[11:12:27] <xpheres> I took the code from here
[11:12:28] <xpheres> http://myprogrammingblog.com/2013/08/27/how-to-make-a-contact-form-with-bootstrap-3-jqueryphphtml5jqbootstrapvalidation/

[11:13:30] <xpheres>        var message = $("textarea#message").val(); did not send anything
[11:14:08] <xpheres> I think I will leave a single row input till I find a solution

[11:38:22] <pimlu> hello, I was told to ask here. in jquery ui, is it possible to make resizables snap to each other?
[11:38:28] <pimlu> aka not just to a grid
[12:02:41] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[12:03:24] <Velveeta> hola
[12:06:02] <arthurvr> velveeta: hola! sup today?
[12:09:51] <Velveeta> not much, laying around in a hotel room watching football and drinking
[13:00:18] <alaing_> irc://irc.mozilla.org/
[13:14:27] <arthurvr> iframeTracker: This is the right place for support. Ask your question in here...
[13:15:37] <iframeTracker> Ok let's go
[13:15:53] <iframeTracker> I'm trying to publish a jQuery plugin to the registry.
[13:15:54] <iframeTracker> I followed this "tutorial" : http://plugins.jquery.com/docs/publish/
[13:15:56] <iframeTracker> After adding a "jquery plugins" service hook to my github repository and create this json file : https://github.com/finalclap/iframeTracker-jquery/blob/master/iframetracker.jquery.json, I pushed a new tag 1.0.4.
[13:15:57] <iframeTracker> But my iframetracker is still not available : http://plugins.jquery.com/?s=iframetracker => "Nothing Found"
[13:15:59] <iframeTracker> I hit the "Test service" button on github (https://github.com/finalclap/iframeTracker-jquery/settings/hooks/3738972), no effect
[13:16:00] <arthurvr> iframeTracker: As the site itself states, the plugins registry is kinda 'deprecated': it's in 'read-only' mode. http://plugins.jquery.com/
[13:16:00] <iframeTracker> The error log is unavailable : http://plugins.jquery.com/error.log => Error 502 Ray ID: 19feb014605b0b75 - Bad gateway
[13:16:19] <arthurvr> iframeTracker: you shouldn't register plugins anymore.
[13:17:12] <arthurvr> iframeTracker: the community losed its need for a plugin registry because of many easy package managers.
[13:17:17] <arthurvr> such as npm or bower
[13:17:21] <iframeTracker> ok
[13:17:29] <arthurvr> so you shouldn't follow that tutorial anymore too.
[13:18:03] <iframeTracker> this is surprising because the plugin registry is not old
[13:18:32] <arthurvr> package managers (usefull for every dependency) aren't old too
[13:20:04] <iframeTracker> thanks for your help
[13:20:05] <arthurvr> iframeTracker: the future of the site is discussed in here : https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/161
[13:20:15] <iframeTracker> ok
[13:20:31] <iframeTracker> my plugin is already available on bower
[13:20:43] <iframeTracker> I'm gonna publish it on npm too
[13:20:47] <arthurvr> I'd go for npm to.
[13:21:04] <arthurvr> don't forget the "jquery-plugin" keyword btw
[13:21:09] <arthurvr> in package.json
[13:21:59] <Velveeta> whoa, this channel blew up when i wasn't looking
[13:22:24] <arthurvr> nothing special, don't waste your time velveeta
[13:23:22] <Velveeta> yeah, just finished catching up on reading it.. i wasn't aware the plugin repo was deprecated, so i still learned something, but it definitely makes sense in the wake of services like npm and bower
[13:23:55] <arthurvr> it's not really deprecated. It's in 'read-only' mode
[13:24:15] <arthurvr> (read the gh issue i posted)
[13:24:17] <Velveeta> we were trying to roll our own project internally at one point, that was gonna be a layer around both of those services, to give you a one-stop shop to search for js modules, which would find the best match in npm or bower (if only one was available), or return results from both (if multiple were available) or you could specify which service to prioritize results from
[13:25:24] <Velveeta> i really hate not being able to like one of those 2 as the clear frontrunner... i love bower's flat dependency installation, but it doesn't handle version skew very well... i like npm's ability to handle version skew, but the dependency nesting on windows systems can be problematic
[13:27:44] <arthurvr> velveeta: the nesting is indeed an issue, but that's not npm nor bower specific. It's a windows bug
[13:28:29] <Velveeta> right, although i could also claim complex setup of shared dependency bundles as an issue for browserify setups
[13:29:21] <arthurvr> I get all those points, but sites as the plugin registry aren't good alternatives too.
[13:29:29] <Velveeta> oh no, i'm not saying they are
[13:29:56] <Velveeta> i'm just saying i wish it wasn't so difficult to pick a clear frontrunner as a publishing service between bower and npm
[13:30:03] <Velveeta> they both have drawbacks that i'd love to see resolved
[13:30:51] <arthurvr> agreed. talking about dep managers: remember the days we all though bpm was going to make it?
[13:33:30] <alaing_> hi Cork
[13:33:33] <Velveeta> man, i think i totally missed bpm
[13:34:32] <arthurvr> velveeta: https://github.com/bpm/bpm & https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/49
[13:34:46] <arthurvr> if you're interested in a piece of before-bower history
[13:35:19] <Velveeta> ahhhhhh nice
[13:36:04] <arthurvr> but these days we're just using npm for front-end stuff too, so no need for somthing like bpm anymore
[13:36:15] <Velveeta> well, all of this is kind of a moot point once true es6 modules start becoming widespread, although really, the challenge that both of those deployment systems have will persist to es6 modules
[13:36:24] <Velveeta> which is how to handle disparate dependency versions
[13:36:30] <alaing_> anyone here worked on developing firebug?
[13:36:36] <arthurvr> of course.
[13:36:41] <Velveeta> so once we come up with a simple configuration method of handling nested dependencies, it'll be much better
[13:37:05] <alaing_> in particular firebug.next
[13:37:35] <arthurvr> alaing_: won't you have more luck on irc.mozilla?
[13:37:38] <arthurvr> https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC
[13:37:55] <alaing_> i have tried in there but its quiet :-D
[13:38:07] <alaing_> Cork is in one of the rooms :-D
[13:38:17] <arthurvr> has been a while since I hanged around in there too
[13:38:35] <alaing_> I dont usuallu hangout there
[13:38:43] <Velveeta> cork's been quiet for a while
[13:39:05] <alaing_> enjoying the festive season
[13:39:12] <Velveeta> hopefully
[13:39:47] <alaing_> does anyone in here still use firebug or is it just Chrome Dev tools now days?
[13:40:10] <arthurvr> not specifically chrome devtools, but I think we're kinda done with firebug
[13:40:14] <arthurvr> isn't it?
[13:40:34] <alaing_> I'm hoping to revive fireQuery
[13:40:40] <Velveeta> i use chrome's devtools unless i have reason to specifically debug something in firefox, and even though, it's a 50/50 spit between firefox's devtools and firebug, depending on what i need and how well the native devtools are behaving
[13:40:47] <arthurvr> I'm personally a chrome devtools poweruser, but FF devtools r nice.
[13:41:09] <alaing_> jQuery firebug extension
[13:41:25] <Velveeta> i remember firequery, it was pretty handy to be able to see bound data and whatnot at a glance in the dom
[13:41:35] <arthurvr> if you want: it's not that easy to switch to chrome devtools btw. Can't help you with firebug
[13:41:48] <alaing_> I see Firebug is revamping themselves to basically skin firefox native devtools
[13:42:14] <alaing_> Velveeta: thats exactly what i liked about it
[13:42:35] <Velveeta> you can accomplish the same thing with watch expressions, but it's not nearly as convenient
[13:42:44] <alaing_> Specially when trying to teach junior developers event delgating
[13:43:15] <alaing_> II like the data and delegated events part
[13:43:52] <alaing_> I've spoken to the firequery creator and he is is all on board to get it up to speed. in its current state it doesn't support Firebug v2
[13:45:06] <alaing_> Unfortuantely I dont have a choice of dev tools at work and so only have Firefox to develop in. Not had too much experience with chrome devtools
[13:46:00] <arthurvr> Just FYI, but digging into it isn't difficult. Surely if you have experience with other devtools eg firebug
[13:49:45] <___Axel> Say I have set 2 different event handlers for the same event on the same element. How do I delete a specific one ?
[13:50:26] <arthurvr> check: http://api.jquery.com/off/
[13:50:26] <___Axel> Like $(document).click(function(){console.log("1");}).click(function(){console.log("2");});
[13:50:41] <arthurvr> using namespaces you can point to one specific handler
[13:51:24] <___Axel> So the provided function must be named then ?
[13:52:07] <arthurvr> yes sir
[13:52:16] <arthurvr> no not the function
[13:52:31] <arthurvr> the event must have a namespace
[13:52:42] <arthurvr> read the link i posted, it covers it.
[13:54:34] <___Axel> Oh, I might as well use unbind
[14:01:41] <alaing_> Good night all
[14:40:12] <Velveeta> damnit, i missed more jquery stuff
[14:40:20] <Velveeta> that's what i get for drinking
[15:09:13] <clave_21> can someone help me to solve an error like "unexpected token ,"?
[15:09:24] <AlexR> you have a comma somewhere that shouldn't have a comma
[15:09:25] <clave_21> i can't see that problem
[15:10:08] <clave_21> i don't think
[15:10:19] <clave_21> because the error is on line 1 of my js
[15:10:27] <clave_21> and i have nothing on line 1
[15:10:28] <BillCriswell> clave_21: A minimized js file?
[15:10:36] <AlexR> can you paste your code?
[15:10:40] <AlexR> jsfiddle.net
[15:39:59] <Miles8of9> what's the difference between  $(function() {  and $(document) ?
[15:40:32] <BillCriswell> Miles8of9: One is just a shortcut for the other.
[15:40:55] <Miles8of9> ah ok ty
[15:41:05] <BillCriswell> Miles8of9: Assuming you're talking about $(document).ready()
[15:41:16] <Miles8of9> yes
[15:42:01] <BillCriswell> Ah, they yes.
[15:43:47] <BillCriswell> then*
[17:03:20] <NBhosting> does this work crossbrowser https://dpaste.de/L7Qc
[17:03:21] <NBhosting> some users complaning the cant open the menu
[17:04:52] <Duvdevan> NBhosting why you used this:         document.getElementById('menulink').innerHTML = 'Menu Openen';
[17:04:57] <Duvdevan> when you have jQuery?
[17:05:24] <NBhosting> yeah could be done in jquery i gues, coudl that break it on other browsers?
[17:06:27] <Duvdevan> no, why should it?
[17:06:39] <Duvdevan> $('#menulink').html('Menu Openen');
[17:06:42] <Duvdevan> much shorter and easier
[17:07:10] <NBhosting> k some users saying they cant open it. must be old i.e. then i gues
[17:09:35] <vitorfs> the jquery itself is fine, will work cross-browser
[17:09:43] <vitorfs> but the css might be the problem
[17:09:48] <wa5ted> dpends on the version
[17:09:50] <vitorfs> i mean, this class "show-nav"
[17:09:54] <wa5ted> and browser
[17:11:24] <NBhosting> how could it test this if it fails any good tools for that
[17:13:46] <vitorfs> if you are on windows, you can test it on IE on different versions using compatibility mode
[17:13:52] <NBhosting> mac
[17:14:19] <vitorfs> usually i test using a virtual machine
[17:14:26] <vitorfs> paralles or virtual box
[17:14:29] <vitorfs> its handy sometimes
[17:14:33] <NBhosting> ah yeah thats not a bad idea
[17:17:04] <NBhosting> testize.com
[17:17:06] <NBhosting> nice to
[17:17:28] <NBhosting> to bad it aint free
[17:17:42] <wa5ted> NBhosting: if you are going with aid option
[17:17:48] <wa5ted> browserstack is the way to go
[17:17:54] <NBhosting> k checking
[17:19:06] <wa5ted> i love how hen you search browser on google
[17:19:11] <wa5ted> opera is the first result that comes up
[17:19:28] <axilla> NBhosting: on a mac you can use VirtualBox and Microsoft has free IE8 and IE9 VM's
[17:19:36] <vitorfs> really nice service this browserstack
[17:19:41] <axilla> browserstack blows
[17:19:52] <NBhosting> yeah prety cool, i can even see errors
[17:19:53] <axilla> i'd rather eat rusty nails than test in browserstack
[17:20:06] <vitorfs> really?
[17:20:08] <axilla> testing over flash is horrible.
[17:20:10] <vitorfs> first time im looking at
[17:20:19] <axilla> we use browserstack at work
[17:20:32] <axilla> and i quit using it because half the time its a cluster fuck trying to click anything.
[17:20:42] <axilla> it lags really badly for me
[17:20:45] <vitorfs> oh well
[17:20:57] <axilla> i downloaded the free VM's from microsoft
[17:21:07] <wa5ted> axilla: better than downloading an entire vm
[17:21:08] <axilla> and pointed my vhosts to localhost
[17:21:11] <wa5ted> just for ie
[17:21:15] <axilla> far from it
[17:21:31] <vitorfs> was too good to be truth
[17:21:46] <axilla> some people like browserstack, i hated it.
[17:21:46] <wa5ted> i wish the light kit youtube theme
[17:21:53] <wa5ted> made the ui translucent
[17:21:57] <axilla> and why pay for anything.. harddrive space is free
[17:22:03] <axilla> vm's for ie8 and 9 are free.
[17:22:07] <axilla> what else do you need?
[17:22:12] <wa5ted> axilla: everyhtign has disadvantages upless you go to the core
[17:22:17] <wa5ted> which is download win os
[17:22:18] <wa5ted> and ttest
[17:22:25] <axilla> i dont need to download windows 9s
[17:22:27] <axilla> os
[17:22:43] <axilla> https://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools
[17:22:48] <axilla> use test vm's from microsoft
[17:22:56] <axilla> they're free, smaller, and much better than browserstack
[17:23:00] <vitorfs> well, as i work with c# sometimes i always need an vm ready hehe so its no big deal for me
[17:23:08] <axilla> but if you insist on browserstack by all means enjoy :)
[17:23:21] <axilla> i just had a horrible issue with the flash over my net connection..
[17:23:34] <axilla> and i live in a pretty rural place.. dunno if its routing or what, but its shit at my house.
[17:23:43] <NBhosting> ill checkout the free vms for sure
[17:25:59] <wa5ted> axilla: i raise you the remote desktop windows
[17:26:06] <wa5ted> i have a windows system in my basement
[17:26:12] <wa5ted> connect via intranet
[17:26:13] <NBhosting> he gives a console is undifined in 1.e.8
[17:26:15] <wa5ted> gG
[17:29:25] <axilla> i haven't owned a windows system in years.
[17:29:50] <axilla> linux before i switched to a macbook
[17:33:59] <NBhosting> im a apple lover :D
[17:35:19] <NBhosting> but yeahit seems older version of i.e. dont like console.
[17:35:22] <NBhosting> so i removed those
[17:35:36] <NBhosting> like console.log('x')
[17:36:28] <NBhosting> btw that virtual machines give an error here on virtualbox
[17:37:36] <NBhosting> lets try to unpack it once more
[17:45:38] <MetalHead77> Anyone here ever used pubnub before?
[17:47:38] <wa5ted> no
[17:57:25] <NBhosting> mm and probaly the stylesheet
[18:02:01] <NBhosting> my css https://www.knalverliefd.nl/static/dist/css/simple-sidebar.css
[18:02:09] <NBhosting> probaly the webkit right
[18:02:12] <NBhosting> and transform
[19:11:16] <Mark_2> can anyone give me a hand on applying this js? http://glide.jedrzejchalubek.com/
[19:16:52] <wa5ted> Mark_2: whats so difficult
[19:17:27] <Mark_2> it’s a bit weird situation.
[19:17:51] <Mark_2> i can have it shown when i set the specific number to the width and height
[19:18:14] <Mark_2> but i can’t set it up to be 100% width or hieght to the current resolution
[19:18:30] <Mark_2> i don’t know what the problem is.
[19:18:36] <wa5ted> Mark_2: js fiddle please
[19:18:40] <wa5ted> so i can take a lok at code
[19:18:51] <Mark_2> can i just show you my website?
[19:18:52] <wa5ted> jsut as a rule of thumb when you set hieght and width of body
[19:19:00] <wa5ted> you need to set both the html and body together
[19:19:03] <wa5ted> Mark_2: ^
[19:19:44] <Mark_2> you want js fiddle or my website?
[19:19:51] <wa5ted> give me site
[19:20:09] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/test
[19:20:24] <Mark_2> this is when i don’t put an image inside the slide
[19:20:29] <Mark_2> and give me a sec.
[19:20:45] <wa5ted> Mark_2: ummmm why is your js exposed?
[19:21:22] <Mark_2> no, that’s my CMS showing.
[19:21:29] <Mark_2> i typed in as a text
[19:21:34] <Mark_2> you can ignoreit
[19:21:35] <Mark_2> * it
[19:22:17] <wa5ted> i dont see any slider
[19:22:49] <Mark_2> yea..
[19:22:51] <Mark_2> give me a sec
[19:22:56] <wa5ted> kk
[19:22:56] <Mark_2> i don’t know why it is not showing
[19:24:13] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/test
[19:24:20] <Mark_2> now there it is.
[19:24:56] <Mark_2> it’s just an image that i put in manually.
[19:25:19] <Mark_2> it was supposed to be just the background image to the .box
[19:25:32] <Mark_2> but it doesn’t work.
[19:25:38] <Mark_2> so i put it in manually.
[19:33:55] <wa5ted> Mark_2:  and what is wrong
[19:34:17] <wa5ted> cant get the aspect ratio rigt?
[19:34:23] <wa5ted> if you use background iamges
[19:34:30] <Mark_2> yeah. basically
[19:34:31] <wa5ted> hten you can use background-size:cover;
[19:34:49] <Mark_2> and also, if all i can do is just putting a huge image inside the slides
[19:35:00] <Mark_2> i can’t type in another texts and so on to the slides
[19:35:08] <Mark_2> which is the whole purpose of having gaint slides
[19:38:16] <Mark_2> no the background-size doesn’t work.
[19:38:27] <Mark_2> i think it’s just the js issue.
[19:38:34] <Mark_2> but thanks for your time.
[19:59:07] <pimlu> in jquery ui, is there a way to make resizing snap to the edges of other elements?
[19:59:38] <pimlu> with draggable it's easy
[21:34:19] <Hacym> Hello
[21:36:58] <Hacym> I am trying to submit a form with ajax every time a field is changed, but it is only posting the one field that is being changed… Is there a way to post the entire form on every change?
[21:44:21] <doug64k> Hacym: that depends upon how you are posting it. with ajax/
[21:44:22] <doug64k> ?
[21:44:29] <Hacym> Yes
[21:44:34] <Hacym> Jquery ajax function
[21:44:56] <Hacym> http://pastebin.com/WabFHS2f
[21:45:18] <doug64k> "this" is the input
[21:45:46] <doug64k>         var formData = new FormData($(this).closest('form')[0]);
[21:46:05] <Hacym> Hmm that makes sense
[21:46:07] <Hacym> one second
[21:47:07] <Hacym> hmm
[21:47:15] <Hacym> doug64k I’m gettng  Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation now
[21:47:41] <doug64k> it would be far easier on jsfiddle
[21:47:46] <doug64k> I cant debug pastebin
[21:49:04] <doug64k> you should be using delegation too
[21:49:20] <doug64k> then you can naturally get the form reference
[21:50:16] <Hacym> hmm
[21:50:19] <Hacym> I have never used those
[21:51:38] <doug64k> I'll make one for you
[21:52:56] <Hacym> SO the jsfiddle doesn’t really work right :) That or I just am not using it right. All of the templating is in python
[21:53:26] <Hacym> So i can’t really put the form into jsfiddle
[21:57:52] <doug64k> Hacym: try something like this http://jsfiddle.net/adffL1gt/3/
[21:58:41] <doug64k> wait though...
[21:59:27] <doug64k> I dont usually use new FormData, I build it manually. I am getting an error in the console the way you were doing it
[22:00:25] <doug64k> sorry, typo
[22:00:55] <Hacym> Hmmm
[22:00:58] <Hacym> Still getting Uncaught TypeError: Illegal invocation
[22:01:11] <Hacym> Sounds like a value isn’t getting passed, it’s passing the html?
[22:03:53] <doug64k> Hacym: file upload involved?
[22:03:57] <Hacym> no
[22:04:13] <Hacym> just text fields and selects
[22:16:57] <doug64k> Hacym: http://jsfiddle.net/adffL1gt/5/
[22:17:04] <doug64k> I think you need processData: false
[22:17:32] <doug64k> of course it doesn't really work on jsfiddle because there is no create_image
[22:18:41] <doug64k> Hacym: and I would also add an error handler that does something better than this: http://jsfiddle.net/adffL1gt/6/
