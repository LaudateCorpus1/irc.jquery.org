[07:21:37] <tlatelolco> hello. I  am with Bootstrap v3.0.0 and I don't manage to reset a <select> to its <option value="-1" selected=""></option> "default" value. $("#ca_structure").val("-1");  doesn't help. Here is the code: http://jsfiddle.net/qsguyz26/2/
[07:39:38] <Cork> tlatelolco: your handler is broken
[07:39:48] <Cork> function )() <--
[07:44:58] <tlatelolco> Yes, sorry. http://jsfiddle.net/qsguyz26/3/ It works in jsfiddle but not in my zend + bootstrap application. How can I have a clue why?
[07:46:18] <Cork> tlatelolco: run console.log($("#button").length) just before the click handler
[07:46:44] <Cork> tlatelolco: cause as you bind the event handlers directly on the elements, they have to exist when your code runs
[07:47:41] <tlatelolco> Do you mean in jsfiddle or in my app? length is 1.
[07:51:11] <Cork> in your app
[07:53:00] <tlatelolco> the block starts with $("#bouton-creerCA").click(function() { and the button exists because it makes an ajax POST. Now I am in the success: part, in order to wipe the selects to enable the user to launch another query
[07:54:41] <Cork> so you get a 1 from the console log?
[07:56:08] <tlatelolco> exactly: 1
[07:56:13] <Cork> if yes, then the second question comes what do you get from console.log($('[id="ca_structure"]).length) just before where you do the val("-1")
[07:58:17] <tlatelolco> do you mean console.log($("#ca_structure").length); ? 1 also
[07:58:36] <Cork> no
[07:58:41] <Cork> i mean what i typed
[07:58:52] <Cork> except i missed the closing string
[07:58:59] <Cork> console.log($('[id="ca_structure"]').length)
[07:59:29] <Cork> make sure to run it just before the other code line
[07:59:32] <Cork> and not from a console
[08:00:07] <tlatelolco> also 1
[08:00:35] <Cork> and you used the [id=""] version and not the #?
[08:00:41] <tlatelolco> yes
[08:00:44] <tlatelolco> as you said
[08:00:50] <Cork> donno why it doesn't work then
[08:01:24] <tlatelolco> You noticed the chzn-select class on the select, right?
[08:01:42] <Cork> donno what that means
[08:01:58] <Cork> i just checked so that you actually modify the select value
[08:02:13] <Cork> if your asking about bootstrap specific behaviour your in the wrong channel
[08:02:34] <tlatelolco> i was in ##bootstrap and they told me to come here haha
[08:02:47] <Cork> hmm
[08:03:05] <Cork> well use a unmodified normal select element and see if you get the saem problem
[08:03:20] <Cork> if you do then we have to figure out why your selector doesn't find what is there
[08:03:38] <Cork> but as it looks like now it seams like you are modifying the select, but it isn't what bootstrap is rendering
[08:05:34] <tlatelolco> Ok. When I remove class="form-control chzn-select" from the <select>, it works fine. So I will ask in ##bootstrap. Thank you
[08:06:00] <Cork> tlatelolco: hmm migth be you have a delegated event handler
[08:06:10] <Cork> just removing a class doens't mean bootstrap is rendering it
[08:06:39] <Cork> some framework makes the <select> hidden and renders a separate widget them self
[08:06:52] <Cork> and they often misses if the select element gets value changes
[08:07:39] <Cork> tlatelolco: sounds like what you should do is reduce the page code until you can't remove anything without the problem going away
[09:20:28] <tlatelolco> Hello. Inside `$(function() { ` I have a `$("#eraser").click(function() {` that wipes some fields content. I also need this feature in another .click event. How should I organize my code: may I create an erase function, called by both .click events ?
[09:25:06] <tlatelolco> I found the syntax `$.fn.eraseCA = function() {`. Thanks! jQuery is awesome ^^
[20:57:48] <BearlyDoug> Probably has been asked several times, but is there an ETA as to when download.jqueryui.com will be fixed?
[20:58:57] <robertmaxrees> first i've heard of it.  have you filed a github issue?
[21:03:59] <BearlyDoug> Didn't think it was related to that... since it's returning a 521 error from CloudFlare
[21:04:14] <BearlyDoug> Been down since at least Saturday, maybe Friday.
[21:04:21] <robertmaxrees> there's a github repo specifically for the website :) opened one up here: https://github.com/jquery/jqueryui.com/issues/183
[21:05:26] <BearlyDoug> Thank you for posting that up, Robert. :)
[21:05:29] <robertmaxrees> if you don't need a custom build, there are other places you can donwload the full framework from.
[21:06:47] <BearlyDoug> I actually do need a custom build, thanks to WordPress plugin guidelines
[21:06:53] <robertmaxrees> bummer
[21:06:59] <BearlyDoug> Tell me about it, hah!
[21:07:14] <robertmaxrees> fwiw dev on that project seems to have all but stopped.
[21:11:48] <BearlyDoug> Oh, peachy!
[21:12:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:12:24] <BearlyDoug> Shame, because that's really allowed for a lot of additional flexibility without having to hook into fifty million little scripts.
[21:12:35] <robertmaxrees> per what?
[21:13:08] <robertmaxrees> there are a ton of options these days for building out UIs.
[21:22:13] <BearlyDoug> Thought you said development of jqueryui project pretty much stopped?
[21:23:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  minimal tweaks and fixes, no major features in a while.  hasn't seen a release in a bit, either.
