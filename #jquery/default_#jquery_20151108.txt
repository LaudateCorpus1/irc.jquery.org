[07:46:33] <manrig> Hi guys I'm having issues with my images responsiveness, I believe due to isotope filtering, can anyone offer advice ? http://pastebin.com/K2w8nrF4 - http://manolzemultimedia.com.au/#works-2
[07:47:55] <placidb> I'm working on a gallery and I'm running into a problem with the stacking order of the images. http://vriesia.greyhat.nl/prospect/carrousel.php
[07:48:21] <placidb> I'm not sure if this needs a solution in jQuery or in css
[07:49:02] <placidb> to be precise, the z-index is being applied mid-transition, instead of at the start of the transition (which is what I want)
[07:49:16] <placidb> any pointers would be most welcome!
[08:26:21] <placidb> when did freenode turn into efnet?
[08:34:50] <robhol> placidb: never. What do you mean :p

[12:22:06] <PrCZeK> Hello, Is there anyone who use jquery uniform ?
[12:38:11] <gitter> hello! i'm writing a quick script that pulls in html w/ajax and puts it on the page. Then I need to be able to hover over part of that ajax rendered html. I know that I should use $(container).on('hover', ajaxSpecificEl, function) but I want 'this' to be equal to the ajaxSpecificEl and not the container. Any thoughts?

[15:39:15] <madprops> hi im confused
[15:39:20] <madprops> i use jquery
[15:39:29] <madprops> yet people present angular like it's some sort of holy grail and jquery killer
[15:39:35] <madprops> but i have the idea they do different things
[15:39:42] <madprops> can angular do everything jquery does?
[15:42:21] <chingyy938>  Hi guys, if (/-/.test(a)) detects if it has a - in my variable, but how can i detect if it contains a +?
[15:42:23] <madprops> and i dont need angular at all
[15:42:35] <madprops> i can do everything i need with jquery and sometimes handlebars
[15:42:47] <Xgc> madprops: Check the faq for angular.  It reports to support a subset.
[15:44:04] <robhol> chingyy938: the same thing, except + already has a meaning in regex, so you escape it with \
[15:44:27] <chingyy938> like this? +\
[15:44:43] <chingyy938> or /+/\ ?
[15:44:52] <madprops> Xgc, i see they have their own implementation, jqlite
[15:45:16] <madprops> i still dont see why i would use angular
[15:45:31] <robhol> chingyy938: \+
[15:46:06] <chingyy938> if (\+.test(b))
[15:46:13] <chingyy938> it says it's illegal in console :(
[15:46:23] <chingyy938> @ robhol
[15:47:02] <robhol> yeah, that's just how the regex looks. You still need the /s on each side for Javascript to recognize it as a regex
[15:47:12] <chingyy938> if (/\+/.test(b))
[15:47:14] <chingyy938> that worked i think
[15:47:20] <Xgc> madprops: Very often, you aren't limited to just A xor B.
[15:47:21] <chingyy938> thanks robhol
[15:47:27] <robhol> np o/

[19:41:59] <shoky> killall:  php is not jquery
