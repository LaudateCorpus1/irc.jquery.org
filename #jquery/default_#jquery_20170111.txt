[02:45:10] <suexec> I have a page based on bootstrap. Instead of loading the entire page on each link click, I have written a small method using ajax to simply load servlets and putting the content in a div. This is working perfectly but has effectively rendered the back button useless. Can I fix this? Is it possible to bind a javascript method call to the back button ?
[04:14:24] <Cork> suexec: yes, have a look at history.pushState
[04:14:28] <Cork> (and popState)

[07:49:44] <jquery352> hi all
[07:53:23] <jquery352> i am facing a problem regarging $.ajax for 1 day now: i`ve installed jquery 3.1.1. from npm and my project crashes. It worked when jquery 1.x.x was copied directly into the project. Furthermore if I install jquery 1.x.x from npm it works. The issue i managed to find reduces to this: ajax will not return an object after a get request to my promise. The request finishes as I can see it in network tab. Does anyone have any ideas?
[07:55:26] <jquery352> when my promise resolves i have no object in there. and if I attach a success or complete to the $.ajax it still doent return any object, Just: ["undefined", "succes", jxhrOBj]
[07:57:18] <FilipNortic__> jquery352: 1.x.x? what jquery 1 version did you know it was working from? you most likely want to do a fiddle or something like it to check if you code should be valid...
[08:04:38] <jquery352> i previously used jquery 1.12.3. both copied and through npm install my project compiles and everything is ok. when upgranding to version 2.2.0 or 3.1.1. the promise code brakes. I`ve seen this is changed in the official doc. But for me the is no object returned in the .done callback of the promise, although the network tab in dev tools shows my json there. I will try a fiddle to test the code as you recommended. Thank you!
[08:08:57] <Tantza55> hello. i have an issue, i'm creating a SVG editor, and i'm trying to create this functionality: when you click btnText button, then go in the SVG area of the editor and left click there, it should display a default text ("Click here to write something..."), so then you can modify it. i have written the function, but when i left click in the SVG area, it wouldn't display that default text. this is my https://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0
[08:09:04] <FilipNortic__> jquery352: you might wanna check expected return type for the ajaxrequest. It's can be hard to know if that changes but I havn't update to 3.x yet so I don't have the feel for all changes get
[08:09:52] <FilipNortic__> Tantza55: your like give me a 404 error
[08:11:52] <Tantza55> FilipNortic__: https://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0o/24/ i updated it again.. try now
[08:11:58] <Tantza55> hope now it works
[08:20:38] <Xatenev> Hi
[08:20:49] <Xatenev> I got this script: https://bpaste.net/show/bcea408838a1 - sadly the JS stops executing after line 3/4
[08:20:51] <Xatenev> without an error.

[08:22:21] <Xatenev> Sec
[08:22:41] <Xatenev> Woet: How can I create a fiddle without a CDN?
[08:22:46] <Xatenev> Woet: Of the libraries I use?
[08:23:03] <Xatenev> Is there anything I can use to just upload some js from the lib?
[08:23:13] <Woet> Xatenev: not sure
[08:23:20] <Xatenev> Guess I could use gist.github with ?raw=true
[08:23:23] <Xatenev> or something weird like that :P
[08:25:30] <FilipNortic__> Tantza55: insert more console.log messages and check which event accually trigger if it's not what you expext, try and refactor the code some cause right now it's very hard to read
[09:42:51] <Dorbian> i'm having a question in regards to ui-resize, is it possible to link elements inside the container to resize as well, have a table in a div, the div resizes exactly as i want it to but the table doesn't, tried several methods but all of m seem to fail
[09:47:21] <FilipNortic__> Dorbian: dosen't alsoresize work for you?
[09:54:37] <Dorbian> let me check
[09:54:59] <Dorbian> think that in my search for the answer i didn't come across that one :)
[09:58:15] <Tantza55> hello. i have an issue, i'm creating a SVG editor, and i'm trying to create this functionality: when you click btnText button, then go in the SVG area of the editor and left click there, it should display a default text ("Click here to write something..."), so then you can modify it. i have written the function, but when i left click in the SVG area, it wouldn't display that default text. this is my https://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0
[10:04:20] <Dorbian> FilipNortic__ that fixed it thanks :) still have a few minor issues but that is probably because of my ignorant hack 'n slash work trying to make it work :)
[11:51:41] <budfox> Hi! I'm working on a simple bitcoin <=> USD converter: http://jsfiddle.net/askhflajsf/rujfzd9h/
[11:51:41] <budfox> However I'd like to switch to using https://localbitcoins.com/bitcoinaverage/ticker-all-currencies/ instead of https://bitpay.com/api/rates for getting the rates, but their structures are so different that I'm completely stumped. Anybody mind taking a look?
[12:01:38] <Jacob1212> I was told that I'm having some Jquery issues with some plugins, but I'm not sure if that is true on  my own. Here is the page in question: http://tsiyon.org/station-schedule/ You can see what is wrong with the visual side of things but I don't know what is causing it.
[12:02:16] <Jacob1212> and https://codecanyon.net/item/wp-timezone-corrector/5133879
[12:05:07] <Jacob1212> in the back end you can select a general id or class that it then looks in for dates or times, next it converts the times to the timezone of the visitor. Which then when the user hovers over or taps on the time displays a pop up of the correct timezone.
[12:05:44] <budfox> Jacob1212: Yo'll have much more luck setting up a reduced test-case: https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[12:06:05] <budfox> * You'll
[12:07:00] <Jacob1212> okay
[12:32:58] <jfive> hello
[12:33:22] <jfive> how could i split an html string by words while still maintaining the html tags?
[12:48:07] <Tantza55> shoky_: you here? :P
[12:50:10] <shoky_> Tantza55: sorta. your text got cut off in the middle of your jsfiddle link btw ;p
[12:51:17] <Tantza55> hi. I have an issue, I'm trying to create a SVG editor, having this functionality: when you click the btnText button, then left-click with the mouse in the SVG area,
[12:51:55] <Tantza55> it should be displayed a default text ("Write somthing here..."), so you can edit it. but the text won't show up at the left-click in the SVG area
[12:52:05] <Tantza55> this is my fiddle https://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0o/29/
[12:52:12] <duch_kazatel> where is the text showing up?
[12:52:24] <Tantza55> nowhere
[12:53:21] <duch_kazatel> are you using a delegated listener?
[12:53:32] <duch_kazatel> because http://stackoverflow.com/a/29101907/923919 has some pertinent info for that.
[12:53:39] <shoky_> Tantza55: <text> cant contain html stuff probably
[12:55:09] <shoky_> Tantza55: also..  divElement.appendTo($("#txtElement"));
[12:55:43] <Tantza55> i attached it at the event of clicking the btnText button
[12:55:56] <shoky_> Tantza55: think you wanted .appendTo(txtElement)
[12:56:12] <duch_kazatel> Tantza55 right, but that handler won't work because the element doesn't exist at the time of binding.
[12:56:23] <duch_kazatel> can't target something that isn't there.
[12:56:27] <shoky_> Tantza55: if you fix that, it'll append the div to the text , but it still doesnt show
[12:58:42] <shoky_> Tantza55:  remove the <div> and put the text node directly into the <text> element, and it'll show.
[12:59:01] <shoky_> Tantza55: but of course, it won't be editable.. no idea if you can do that
[13:00:29] <budfox> I'm working on a simple bitcoin <=> USD converter: http://jsfiddle.net/askhflajsf/rujfzd9h/ -- but how do I switch from parsing BitPay's rate to parsing LocalBitcoin's rate?
[13:00:32] <budfox> https://bitpay.com/api/rates -- {"code":"USD","name":"US Dollar","rate":795.28}
[13:00:35] <budfox> https://localbitcoins.com/bitcoinaverage/ticker-all-currencies/ -- "USD": {"avg_12h": "955.50", "volume_btc": "1203.62100000", "avg_24h": "997.41", "avg_1h": "886.05", "rates": {"last": "956.79"}, "avg_6h": "923.06"}
[13:01:21] <shoky_> Tantza55: you might need a svg <foreignObject> element , to embed the div inside the svg.  but uhh why put it inside a <text> anyway
[13:02:33] <z1haze> jesus now i feel like a moron
[13:03:00] <z1haze> other fucking dev here put transform lowercase
[13:03:19] <z1haze> hmm this is awkward, please ignore :)
[13:04:03] <Tantza55> shoky_: so should i replace text with foreignObject?
[13:04:36] <shoky_> Tantza55: yes but you need to do more than that. learn how to work with foreignObject :)
[13:05:57] <shoky_> Tantza55: er actually seems just replacing it works, sort of..
[13:06:20] <shoky_> but you'll need to handle the next click , when trying to edit it
[13:06:37] <shoky_> otherwise you get a new one showing up where you clicked
[13:07:14] <shoky_> anyways i don't think this is proper use of foreignObject, fwiw
[13:07:29] <shoky_> browser is probably helping out
[13:08:23] <Guest1091> d
[13:08:38] <Guest1091> z1haze: wots a moron?
[13:08:48] <Guest1091> please share with us
[13:10:57] <Tantza55> shoky_: I have an example where it works with the divElement, and it's editable, but I can't manage to figure out why mine isn't
[13:15:14] <shoky_> Tantza55: yours is.. if you do what you said. replace the text with foreignObject
[13:17:27] <Tantza55> shoky_: https://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0o/30/ like this isn't working, should I also remove the txtDiv element?
[13:17:37] <Tantza55> divElement*
[13:19:03] <shoky_> Tantza55: uhh no. how do you expect to have a contenteditable div, if you remove the div :)
[13:19:55] <shoky_> Tantza55: you did remoev the div...
[13:20:01] <shoky_> Tantza55: also you're doing  divElement.appendTo("txtElement");   still wrong
[13:21:12] <Tantza55> shoky_: https://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0o/32/ this is the lastest vrsion of the fiddle
[13:21:16] <Tantza55> sorry
[13:21:34] <shoky_> Tantza55: still wrnog.
[13:21:53] <shoky_> Tantza55: you deleted the divEelment , you're not creating it anywhere.  and you're still doing divElement.appendTo($("txtElement"));
[13:21:57] <shoky_> just... follow instructions
[13:21:59] <shoky_> there were only 2
[13:22:04] <shoky_> <shoky_> Tantza55: think you wanted .appendTo(txtElement)
[13:22:06] <shoky_> that's one
[13:22:18] <shoky_> and the 2nd is replace the <text> with a <foreignObject>
[13:22:22] <shoky_> 2 steps to do :)
[13:22:32] <shoky_> (from your earlier /29/ fiddle)
[13:23:19] <shoky_> Tantza55 and check your console for errors before asking here.
[13:26:51] <Tantza55> i managed to get it working, but it happens what you said, when i click to edit it, another text is displayed
[13:27:53] <shoky_> yap. you can maybe add a click listener to the div and do event.stopPropagation()  on the event argument of the click handler, might fix it
[13:28:50] <shoky_> actually no that isn't working
[13:29:19] <shoky_> ah because its not click events that youre listening for
[13:29:56] <shoky_> Tantza55: yeah do what i said but for mousedown instead of click
[13:30:38] <shoky_> Tantza55 er thats not enough
[13:30:45] <MikeD_> .on( "foo bar baz", function(evt){ /* etc */ } )  <-- is the event list comma separated or space separated ?
[13:30:53] <duch_kazatel> space.
[13:30:58] <MikeD_> k, thanks
[13:31:14] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/ -> "One or more space-separated event types and optional namespaces, such as "click" or "keydown.myPlugin"."
[13:31:17] <duch_kazatel> :)
[13:32:15] <shoky_> Tantza55: well you can do it for both mousedown and mouseup, only problem with that is if you creaet another shape and end the dragging on such a div, it wont register the mouseup
[13:32:26] <shoky_> Tantza55: but it might be good enough for ya
[13:33:08] <shoky_> Tantza55 otherwise you'd need to set some flag while dragging to create a shape, and check that flag in the div mousedown/up handlers
[13:33:33] <shoky_> well, mouseup is the important one
[13:45:01] <Tantza55> shoky_: could you please explain what i should do so that at click on the text it would become editable without another text appearing?
[13:45:25] <Tantza55> shoky_: because i can't seem to figure it out, although u gave me some pointers
[13:56:55] <Tantza55> shoky_: nevermind, i got it, thank you
[14:20:58] <qakhan> hi all, i am useing tooltip for 2 dynamic generated elements. tooltip works on first element but does not work on second element. here is my tooltip code  http://pastebin.com/DqjLn7CB
[14:23:28] <duch_kazatel> $('#allgroupsdiv').tooltip({
[14:23:34] <duch_kazatel> only gets the first one - IDs must be unique.
[14:23:39] <duch_kazatel> repeating it is invalid.
[14:26:55] <qakhan> duch_kazatel i am using selector in tooltip
[14:27:11] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:27:24] <duch_kazatel> not sure what that changes about what I said - looks like you're repeating IDs on the page.
[14:27:27] <duch_kazatel> you can't do that.
[14:27:49] <qakhan> ok let me use class
[14:28:15] <DLC3> i thought he wanted one tooltip on the container o.O
[14:28:39] <duch_kazatel> woah what
[14:28:39] <duch_kazatel> haha
[14:28:43] <duch_kazatel> oh
[14:28:50] <duch_kazatel> he said two separate elements.
[14:29:08] <duch_kazatel> and only the first of the two works.  unless i'm totally missing something here.
[14:35:58] <qakhan> duch_kazatel i am creating dynamic element which contain delete and slide up icon. i want to show tooltip when mouseover on these icons
[14:36:09] <qakhan> here is my complete code http://pastebin.com/JDf3enij
[14:36:17] <duch_kazatel> which tooltip plugin?
[14:36:17] <unsigned_long> I receive a lot of errors "was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure font" on https://www.schweizerdeutsch-lernen.ch (see the console)
[14:36:17] <unsigned_long> However, jquery seems to store these font urls somehow cryptically. Do you know how you can fix that?
[14:36:31] <qakhan> now i used class but not working
[14:37:03] <duch_kazatel> wakh which tooltip plugin.
[14:37:12] <duch_kazatel> unsigned_long "jquery seems to store these font urls" - hrm?
[14:37:34] <duch_kazatel> errr, qakhan which tooltip plugin are you using?
[14:37:41] <unsigned_long> duch_kazatel: I can't find where I have to replace "http" with "https" in my links :O
[14:38:01] <unsigned_long> duch_kazatel: do you have a hint for me, please? I'm really hopeless :D
[14:38:08] <duch_kazatel> unsigned_long what does that have to do with jquery?
[14:38:39] <duch_kazatel> like, https://i.imgur.com/naMoCoq.png
[14:38:42] <duch_kazatel> that's not jquery.
[14:39:15] <unsigned_long> duch_kazatel: (view the page with the chrome console)
[14:39:18] <unsigned_long> You'll find:
[14:39:19] <unsigned_long> Mixed Content: The page at 'https://www.schweizerdeutsch-lernen.ch/' was loaded over HTTPS, but requested an insecure font 'http://fonts.gstatic.com/s/lato/v11/8qcEw_nrk_5HEcCpYdJu8BTbgVql8nDJpwnrE27mub0.woff2'. This request has been blocked; the content must be served over HTTPS.
[14:39:25] <unsigned_long> (source: jquery-latest.min.js)
[14:39:26] <duch_kazatel> unsigned_long right, i know what the error is.
[14:39:51] <qakhan> duch_kazatel this default which comes with jquery and bootstrap
[14:39:52] <duch_kazatel> look at the screenshot i shared.
[14:39:54] <unsigned_long> Can you tell me where to fix this?
[14:40:00] <duch_kazatel> qakhan jquery doesn't have a default one.
[14:40:02] <unsigned_long> oh
[14:40:14] <duch_kazatel> so it's the bootstrap tooltip?
[14:40:40] <qakhan> yes
[14:40:57] <duch_kazatel> qakhan how do you expect to have 2 tooltips on one element?
[14:41:20] <duch_kazatel> ah nevermind.  you don't any more.  could you make a fiddle real quick?
[14:41:32] <qakhan> duch_kazatel i want to tooltips on 2 different elements
[14:41:45] <duch_kazatel> yeah, make a fiddle
[14:42:57] <qakhan> ok
[14:48:25] <Tantza55> shoky_:  still around?
[14:53:12] <qakhan> duch_kazatel here   https://fiddle.jshell.net/1mfgny9j/52/
[14:53:30] <duch_kazatel> woah what
[14:53:57] <qakhan> click on Create Group button and there will be delete and slide up icon at the end
[14:54:08] <duch_kazatel> duder do you need 90% of what's in the external resources?
[14:54:27] <duch_kazatel> also you're including jquery like 3 times in there.
[14:54:47] <qakhan> my mistake i wanted to do it in min time
[14:54:58] <duch_kazatel> had that same problem the other day.
[14:56:28] <duch_kazatel> also your browser has built-in dev tools fwiw.
[14:56:33] <duch_kazatel> either way, starting from https://fiddle.jshell.net/1mfgny9j/54/
[14:56:53] <duch_kazatel> the issue is the tooltip stuff doesn't init after things exist.
[14:57:01] <duch_kazatel> you can only target stuff after it's been inserted.
[14:58:01] <duch_kazatel> try moving those .tooltip calls into the .on()
[14:58:43] <qakhan> i have tried it with .on(mouseenter)
[14:58:50] <duch_kazatel> nonono.
[14:59:04] <duch_kazatel> just copy the two .tooltip calls and put them in that .on() for the creation.
[14:59:08] <duch_kazatel> after you insert the element.
[15:02:03] <Tantza55> duch_kazatel: when you're free, i'm trying to make draggable elements on svg. my code is https://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0o/34/ and i'm not figuring out what i'm doing wrong and why it isn't working.
[15:02:19] <Tantza55> i've almost finished the project, this is the last thing i need to figure out
[15:02:26] <Tantza55> it's been a rough ride though
[15:02:32] <duch_kazatel> where's the code from drag and drop?
[15:02:36] <duch_kazatel> *for
[15:04:44] <Tantza55> duch_kazatel: https://fiddle.jshell.net/40c29o0o/35/ i put a comment "//STARTS HERE
[15:05:18] <duch_kazatel> did you confirm the handler is working at all?
[15:06:49] <Vetaxili> Hi all. Is it possible to disable a link after pressing it once? Removing "href" is not working, and href is added in this way document.location.href. I tried adding a flag and only allowing one click, but with that, when i press the link again it stops loading the page it was supposed to load
[15:07:02] <Tantza55> duch_kazatel: the elementSelectat.mousedown() ?
[15:07:43] <duch_kazatel> Tantza55 yeah i'm not really familiar with what's going on here.  good luck though.
[15:07:58] <Tantza55> duch_kazatel: thank you
[15:08:15] <qakhan> duch_kazatel here with .on()  it works in both elements. but tooltip does not show when we mouse over it first time, when we mouse over again then it works
[15:08:23] <qakhan> https://fiddle.jshell.net/1mfgny9j/55/
[15:08:35] <duch_kazatel> ...
[15:08:36] <duch_kazatel> ;p;
[15:08:52] <duch_kazatel> you're not listening heh
[15:09:50] <duch_kazatel> i mean take the original tooltip initializers.
[15:09:59] <duch_kazatel> and put them after that .append() call.
[15:11:08] <duch_kazatel> https://fiddle.jshell.net/1mfgny9j/56/
[15:11:13] <duch_kazatel> like this.
[15:34:34] <qakhan> duch_kazatel thanks it working, how can i change tooltip text from Hide Group to Show Group when element slideup
[15:36:46] <duch_kazatel> search google for something like "bootstrap change tooltip text" or w/e.
[15:37:05] <duch_kazatel> or just use two elements with two tooltips and show/hide the elements.
[15:43:44] <jfive> hello all
[15:44:44] <jfive> https://regex101.com/r/p6Awvk/1 so this regex is supposed to return each "word," or html element if it's some html. however, as seen at the end of the first line it looks like telephone links is breaking it. any ideas?
[15:45:47] <jfive> actually, sorry, it looks like any links cause this: https://regex101.com/r/p6Awvk/2
[15:49:47] <jfive> hrm I believe I see the issue... it looks like any self-closing html tags breaks it
[15:49:54] <jfive> https://regex101.com/r/p6Awvk/3
[15:50:17] <duch_kazatel> why are you using regex on html in the first place?
[15:50:31] <jfive> duch_kazatel: i was just asking myself the same thing
[15:52:26] <duch_kazatel> heh
[15:52:30] <duch_kazatel> what're you trying to accomplish?
[15:53:02] <jfive> welp, i'm trying to get both the last "word", as well as the "second-to-last" word, from an html string
[15:53:16] <duch_kazatel> "html string"?  and define "word"
[15:54:31] <jfive> html string: some text that may or may not contain html
[15:54:39] <jfive> *contain inline html
[15:54:47] <duch_kazatel> so you want to include tags in those words?
[15:55:13] <jfive> duch_kazatel: yes, for example maybe the last word of a sentence is "here" and that word is in fact a link
[15:55:54] <duch_kazatel> so then back way up - what about cases where you have <span>some thing</span> - what's the last "word" here?
[15:56:32] <jfive> duch_kazatel: very good point. at this point i've been treating <span>some thing</span> all as one "word"
[15:56:43] <duch_kazatel> heh.
[15:56:44] <jfive> though, obviously, that's not accurate
[15:58:10] <duch_kazatel> heh, so how do you define the last "word"?
[15:58:35] <duch_kazatel> it sounds like you want the last "node" (text or otherwise)
[15:58:47] <duch_kazatel> (also, why do you want the last one?)
[15:59:40] <jfive> well, the end goal is to add a &nbsp; between the last word and the second-to-last word. then a secondary goal is to add a zero-width no-break space after any dashes in the second-to-last word.
[15:59:57] <jfive> for the purpose of preventing widows in the copy.
[16:00:47] <duch_kazatel> you mean when people try to copy/paste content?
[16:01:12] <jfive> this is one of those things i've fought with the account managers on and explained time and time again to just stop worrying about widow words (words that end on their own line at the end of the paragraph).
[16:01:23] <duch_kazatel> aaaaaah
[16:01:24] <jfive> until finally i agreed to take a look heh
[16:01:39] <jfive> and the more i talk to you the more i wonder why i still work here. lol
[16:01:53] <jfive> well, not just you. but generally speaking haha
[16:02:04] <jfive> the more i think about these things in general
[16:02:53] <duch_kazatel> http://thenewcode.com/946/CSS-last-line-Controlling-Widows-amp-Orphans
[16:04:37] <duch_kazatel> i'd look for a CSS solution if you can.
[16:05:58] <jfive> hmm for some reason i thought the widows property was only valid for print @media
[16:06:03] <jfive> thanks
[16:06:09] <duch_kazatel> maybe it is (shrug)
[16:06:42] <duch_kazatel> though there's an easy-ish solution for your problem using js.
[17:39:42] <`ULT> Hello, In a if else construction I am only using the if statement, can I delete the else part?
[17:40:59] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[17:41:15] <duch_kazatel> you aren't required to include the else if you don't need it.
[17:41:59] <`ULT> thank you
[17:45:26] <`ULT> Why should you use in this code if (!eventFired)?
[17:45:31] <`ULT> https://jsfiddle.net/g1Lyemrq/
[17:45:40] <`ULT> is this mutch better than without that part?
[17:45:57] <`ULT> In my opinion it is only an extra check for nothing
[17:47:33] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:47:49] <duch_kazatel> oh.
[17:48:02] <duch_kazatel> you don't want to fire it unnecessarily.
[17:48:21] <duch_kazatel> and resize handlers are bad if you don't throttle or debounce
[17:48:48] <`ULT> so #1, this code is better with the eventfired check than without?
[17:48:57] <`ULT> and #2, what are you suggestiong for resize handler?
[17:49:25] <duch_kazatel> you can use .on('resize', function() {});
[17:49:46] <duch_kazatel> but you want to throttle/debounce that handler.
[17:50:23] <`ULT> oke, thank you. So without it is taking to mutch memory?
[17:50:25] <duch_kazatel> and the check is a semi-performant way to not run the handler if the width is over a certain size.
[17:50:34] <duch_kazatel> not memory - cpu time.
[17:51:15] <duch_kazatel> try $(window).on('resize', () => console.log('foo')); in your console and then start resizing the window.  watch how many times that fires.
[17:51:34] <`ULT> Yeah, a lot of times indeed.
[17:52:34] <`ULT> I had myself the idea that a resize handler is not a verry good/ effective way. But I dont realy read bad things over the resize handler on the internet.
[17:52:36] <duch_kazatel> also - $(window) in a resize handler is a bad idea.
[17:52:57] <duch_kazatel> plus, 9/10 you really just want some css.
[17:53:00] <`ULT> but when I would like to use, always use some throttle or debounce
[17:53:22] <duch_kazatel> and cache selectors, etc
[17:53:26] <`ULT> yes that is right.
[17:53:47] <`ULT> What I want is only to show a sticky header when the screen with is > x px
[17:53:59] <duch_kazatel> css then.
[17:54:05] <`ULT> I can also show the sticky header always, and hide when < x px
[17:54:07] <`ULT> in css
[17:54:09] <`ULT> that is better?
[17:54:21] <duch_kazatel> always
[17:54:26] <`ULT> oke thank you.
[17:55:10] <`ULT> I was thinking I dont need to run the sticky header when it is not necessary
[17:56:06] <duch_kazatel> i mena, you can add a simple check in your js for that.
[17:56:35] <`ULT> but checking for the screen width with js/ jquery is worser than running the header always and hiding with css when not needed.
[17:56:47] <duch_kazatel> "running the header"?
[17:56:59] <`ULT> Sorry for bad english, mean the sticky header
[17:57:19] <`ULT>  $(".row_BA661J ").sticky({topSpacing:-2});
[17:57:21] <duch_kazatel> really depends.
[17:57:30] <`ULT> this is starting the header
[17:58:09] <duch_kazatel> (shrug) i'd try it with the show/hide and see how perf is.
[17:58:39] <`ULT> Thank you, I will try tommorow that :)
[17:59:25] <`ULT> Need to sleep now, tomorrow morning to the oral surgeon
[17:59:37] <`ULT> Dont know if that is the correct english word for it ;)
[18:19:10] <dglambert> night all
[20:41:28] <icor1031> hello
[20:41:33] <icor1031> ($("parentfolder=VARIABLENAME")) <-- how do I do this?...
[20:42:07] <duch_kazatel> do what?
[20:42:12] <duch_kazatel> that's not a valid selector
[20:42:12] <icor1031> I want to select element "parentfolder" where its value is equal to a variable
[20:42:20] <duch_kazatel> "value"?
[20:42:31] <duch_kazatel> and is it <parentfolder>?
[20:42:33] <icor1031> var VARIABLENAME = "test";
[20:42:41] <icor1031> <div parentfolder="test">
[20:42:49] <duch_kazatel> that's not a valid attribute.
[20:43:19] <icor1031> how about if I use data-parent?
[20:43:22] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[20:43:27] <duch_kazatel> then you could just use .filter()
[20:43:37] <icor1031> will look that up thanks
