[07:58:47] <cek> i see the following in mdn: "If you need the bounding rectangle relative to the top-left corner of the document, just add the current scrolling position to the top and left properties (these can be obtained using window.scrollX and window.scrollY) to get a bounding rectangle which is independent from the current scrolling position."
[07:59:00] <cek> but wtf, why not just use el.offsetTop?!
[07:59:32] <cek> why `el.getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY`  instead of el.offsetTop? :/
[08:00:28] <Cork> those aren't the same thing in all cases
[08:01:52] <cek> oh, a scrolled el inside a scrolled window?
[08:03:25] <Cork> i think transform affects one of bounding too, but not sure; i usually need to look it up when i need it (and isn't that often)
[08:04:01] <Cork> read the mdn page for getBoundingClientRect it describes it
[12:19:18] <xenaxon> hello all !
[12:19:37] <robertmaxrees> morning
[12:19:41] <xenaxon> Is it possible to detect when a span element content has changed?
[12:19:55] <robertmaxrees> it's not a good idea to do that xenaxon
[12:20:02] <xenaxon> but is it possible?
[12:20:13] <robertmaxrees> not via jquery.
[12:20:21] <robertmaxrees> and it's a bad idea.
[12:21:10] <xenaxon> why
[12:21:12] <xenaxon> and why not
[12:21:36] <robertmaxrees> because you should hook into your logic instead of proxying and dispatching things through the DOM.
[12:22:48] <xenaxon> a script is modifying stuff on an span
[12:22:59] <xenaxon> and I want to detect which js is doing this
[12:23:04] <xenaxon> I cant find which one is doing it
[12:23:27] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways to figure that out.  can you share the site in the channel?
[12:26:05] <robertmaxrees> either way, you can use your inspector to look for classes on that element or ancestor elements and see if anything looks like something you'd select on in code.  from there, you can use your dev tools to search all js files and go from there.
[12:27:43] <xenaxon> its not a site
[12:27:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:27:52] <xenaxon> its on my own computer, my project
[12:27:58] <xenaxon> wordpress
[12:28:05] <xenaxon> i havent published it yet
[12:28:09] <robertmaxrees> that's... still a site.
[12:28:10] <xenaxon> but I just cant find this
[12:28:15] <xenaxon> incredible
[12:28:16] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:28:22] <robertmaxrees> you can use my advice above to search for it.
[14:10:16] <Cupertina> Hi guys. Anyone here has experience with using jspdf? Trying to make the charts in the pdf document more visible. Right now it looks a bit fuzzy:
[14:10:18] <Cupertina> https://imgur.com/VHM3ssJ
[14:10:55] <taplar> doesn't look like a jQuery plugin
[14:11:02] <taplar> you might try ##javascript
[20:15:23] <robertparkerx> How would I search through an array and find the keys for the items in the cart that have amount > 0
[20:16:21] <robertparkerx> here is what the array lookks like https://d.pr/i/Oi2lkv
[20:20:28] <robertparkerx> .each
