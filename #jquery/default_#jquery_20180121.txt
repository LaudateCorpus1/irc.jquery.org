[16:11:38] <stan_man_can> say i have <div id="wizard"> and there's a few <div class='step'></div> in it
[16:12:19] <stan_man_can> then I have prev/next buttons, is there any way to kind of get the current index of a selection ?
[16:12:50] <stan_man_can> which index $(".step:visible") is in $("#wizard .step")
[16:12:52] <stan_man_can> if that makes sense..
[23:50:13] <arosen> I have a string that looks like this: "=?UTF-8?Q?=C3=A2=C2=9C=C2=A8" I'm wondering how to convert that to show up as the ascii char when on the page.
