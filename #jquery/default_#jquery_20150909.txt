[01:04:20] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/gmtl <--- I've got this file, and http://i.imgur.com/mJgWnJX.png this image. why is the text not set or visible?
[01:27:33] <axscode> hi guys, how can i pass an object let say.. var this_span = $(this);      then function edit_this_span(this_span) { this_span.attr('rel-data','added-attribs') }
[01:28:39] <Cork> axscode: are you asking how to pass an argument to a function??
[01:30:36] <Boogymanx> Hey guys, I have a data-attribute on a div with class container-fluid
[01:30:49] <Boogymanx> I'm trying to catch this attribute with             var $rg = $(".container-fluid").data("rg"); , but this returns undefined
[01:30:54] <Boogymanx> same if i try .attr("data-rg");
[01:31:16] <Cork> $(".container-fluid").data("attribute")
[01:31:57] <halvors> Hi, is there a simple way i can get a checkbox to post the form it is in when checked/unchecked?
[01:32:17] <Boogymanx> halvors: an ajax request that is bound on checkbox.change and if this.checked
[01:32:21] <axscode> Cork, i wanted to pass the object to a function and set the attribute there.
[01:32:27] <Boogymanx> I'm working on the same thing coincidentally :p
[01:32:38] <halvors> Boogymanx: Ahy ajax?
[01:32:38] <Cork> axscode: ya, so  edit_this_span(this_span);
[01:32:44] <Boogymanx> Cork: I have that, but it doesn't work
[01:32:57] <Boogymanx> halvors: well, I'm using AJAX because I don't want to refresh the page
[01:32:58] <halvors> The form is ready, i only need something that triggers the form posting when checkbox is checked.
[01:32:59] <Cork> Boogymanx: make a jsfiddle showing the html and the js code not working
[01:33:15] <halvors> Boogymanx: Using json for that.
[01:33:18] <Cork> halvors: why would a checkbox trigger submission of a form?
[01:33:21] <axscode> Cork, so whatever element/object is passed in there should be reference to that object
[01:33:38] <Cork> axscode: uh... what?
[01:33:39] <Boogymanx> Cork: my use case is updating the search results based on added/removed filters
[01:33:50] <Cork> ah
[01:34:03] <Boogymanx> but in order to keep the original search I need to get those data-attributes
[01:34:04] <halvors> Cork: Because i want user to be able to check boxes.
[01:34:07] <Boogymanx> anyway, jsfiddle time
[01:34:12] <halvors> It's kind of a todo list.
[01:34:37] <Cork> Boogymanx: $('form').on('click', 'input:checkbox', function() { $(this).closest('form').trigger('submit'); })
[01:34:55] <Boogymanx> cool :o
[01:34:56] <axscode> aw... hmmm its like i have span1 span2 span3 span4,   edit_this_span(span1)   whatever i changed in span1 inside edit_this_span shall take effect on span1 element?
[01:35:39] <Cork> axscode: could you jsfiddle the context?
[01:35:50] <Cork> meaning the code your working with
[01:36:13] <Cork> uh...
[01:36:17] <Cork> Boogymanx: sorry wrong nick
[01:36:28] <Cork> halvors: this was for you $('form').on('click', 'input:checkbox', function() { $(this).closest('form').trigger('submit'); })
[01:36:36] <halvors> Thanks :)
[01:36:46] <Boogymanx> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/srzsrrw2/ this is the fiddle but it works in the fiddle for some reason
[01:37:02] <halvors> But whould that trigger only the form that the checkbox is in?
[01:37:09] <Cork> Boogymanx: in your page do console.log($(".container-fluid").length)
[01:37:15] <Cork> before the .data call
[01:37:30] <Cork> halvors: yes
[01:37:40] <Cork> $(this).closest is for that specific reason
[01:37:56] <halvors> Cork: Isn't changed a more fitting event to use instead of click?
[01:37:58] <Cork> halvors: you want to replace the $('form') with a specific selector for the form though
[01:38:23] <halvors> Cork: Why? That is what i want to avoid :)
[01:38:27] <Boogymanx> I'm working with a framework so it's not all of the HTML and the data-attributes are gained from variables sent in the request context, but in source code they show up
[01:38:27] <Cork> halvors: change is fine too, but checkboxes fire both when the checkbox is triggered
[01:38:33] <Boogymanx> Cork: the length returns 2
[01:38:47] <halvors> Cork: And checked and unchecked?
[01:38:50] <Cork> Boogymanx: then you most likely grab the .data from the element without it
[01:39:00] <Cork> halvors: change is triggered on both
[01:39:04] <Boogymanx> ahh, yeah
[01:39:10] <Cork> check this.checked if you want one direction
[01:39:22] <Boogymanx> I'm working in a template that only has one div like that, but it includes page snippets that do have another container
[01:39:29] <Boogymanx> thanks Cork, I'd have been stuck for ages on that
[01:40:07] <Cork> Boogymanx: the simplest solution is most likely to use $(this).next() for lable
[01:40:09] <Cork> *label
[01:40:21] <Cork> and $(this).closest('.container-fluid') for the div
[01:40:26] <halvors> Cork: Is there any way to avoid putting in a specific selector instead if form?
[01:40:29] <Cork> less messy selectors
[01:40:31] <axscode> hehe thanks Cork, it works what im trying to explain
[01:40:49] <Cork> halvors: if you only care about any form just leave it as form
[01:40:53] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/gmtl <--- I've got this file, and http://i.imgur.com/mJgWnJX.png this image. why is the text not set or visible?
[01:41:38] <Cork> halvors: if you bind it on form it will make all checkboxes trigger there form if they are changed
[01:42:07] <Boogymanx> Cork: this.next returns the DOM element :p I only need the text really. I added an ID to the proper container, that fixed the issue :)
[01:42:11] <Boogymanx> thanks for the help! <3
[01:42:42] <Cork> Boogymanx: ya, but the elements are relative, so why use id selectors when you don't need them
[01:42:48] <Cork> just means more to maintain
[01:43:06] <halvors> Cork: That's no issue since theres only gonna be 1 :)
[01:43:16] <halvors> Cork: Somehow the cod is not working for me :(
[01:43:19] <Cork> halvors: then leave it as it is
[01:43:19] <halvors> code*
[01:43:39] <halvors> Do you have a jsfiddle?
[01:43:56] <halvors> It goes in the $(document).ready(function() { right?
[01:44:43] <halvors> Um, is it ok to load the javascript file before the form in html?
[01:44:55] <Cork> halvors: http://jsfiddle.net/e8zwdm7w/
[01:45:04] <Cork> halvors: yes it does
[01:45:26] <Cork> (jsfiddle uses onload by default, so you don't need the $(function() {}); wrapper there)
[01:47:29] <halvors> Cork: You mean $(document).ready(function() ?
[01:48:11] <Cork> halvors: $(func) === $(document).ready(func)
[01:55:25] <halvors> Cork: I am confused, will not $(document).ready(function() do?
[01:55:48] <Cork> yes it will, my point is it is the same thing as $(function() {})
[01:56:19] <Cork> halvors: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery3
[01:56:20] <halvors> ah ok.
[01:56:58] <halvors> Cork: Newer method to do it?
[01:57:12] <Cork> nope
[01:57:27] <Cork> just a shortcut version :)
[01:57:34] <Cork> been there basically as long as .ready has
[02:40:46] <halvors> Cork: The script is still not working for me, any idea why? I've done it exactly as in your jsfiddle.
[02:41:07] <halvors> Cork: Somehow the checkbox click event is never catched.
[02:41:16] <Cork> halvors: are you adding the form through ajax?
[02:41:32] <Cork> or do you have any other event handlers that do return false?
[02:41:54] <halvors> Cork: No.
[02:42:08] <Cork> hard to say then
[02:42:31] <halvors> I'm using JQuerry 1.11.1
[02:42:41] <Kamuela> Cork: how would I $('body').append a binary image?
[02:42:50] <Cork> you don't
[02:43:00] <Kamuela> What do you use instead?
[02:43:15] <Cork> you append an img tag and link it to the image
[02:43:30] <Kamuela> what if your server sends it as an image stream
[02:44:00] <Cork> uh... what do you mean by stream?
[02:46:47] <Kamuela> checking on that... lol
[02:49:05] <guessx> src="'+uri+'"
[02:49:52] <halvors> Cork: I'm running JQuerry 1.11.1, is that compatible with the code?
[02:49:59] <Cork> no
[02:50:04] <Cork> opps
[02:50:08] <Cork> sorry yes XD
[02:50:16] <Cork> every ting > 1.7 is
[03:10:46] <Kamuela> Cork: just the very top of this is the jquery, is the approach incorrect?
[03:10:48] <Kamuela> http://pastie.org/private/sezlebfnmxaincebzz5ha#19,23,25-27,35,39
[03:11:34] <Kamuela> minus the .append needing to use an img tag of course
[03:12:18] <Cork> Kamuela: just use $.param and build an url and put that in an img tag
[03:13:10] <Cork> you can do the way your doing, but you would have to convert "logo" into a Blob and then make an url for that blob (and you would be limited to browsers that support blobs)
[03:13:31] <mintmoney> Kamuela: just found this https://jsfiddle.net/Jan_Miksovsky/yy7Zs/
[03:13:32] <Kamuela> mintmoney see Cork
[03:13:33] <Cork> just adding the url is a better option as it works with much older browsers
[03:13:44] <mintmoney> renders the blob in the browser
[03:13:59] <Kamuela> Cork suggested using $.param to build the url
[03:14:30] <Cork> if you had to post the data to the server, for example to include a file or something then ajax makes sense
[03:14:45] <Cork> but for what your doing it just creates a lot of extra traffic and work
[03:15:09] <Kamuela> i think we're posting the login token to retrieve the image
[03:15:13] <mintmoney> well I'm not serving the file from a publicly accessible directory... that's the whole point
[03:15:24] <Cork> there isn't any type in the ajax call
[03:15:31] <Cork> so it will be get by default
[03:15:31] <mintmoney> it defaults to get
[03:16:00] <Cork> mintmoney: it is public if you can access it through ajax
[03:16:18] <Cork> your just adding a step through ajax to obfuscate it
[03:17:29] <mintmoney> yes, you're right
[03:17:42] <Cork> it will be zero difference to the user if you do $('<img>, { src: $.param(logoObj) }).appendTo('body')
[03:18:02] <Cork> or $.ajax ... $('<img>') /* append url for blob object */
[03:18:36] <Cork> meaning the user will still be able to save the image
[03:18:57] <Cork> you will just make it impossible for there cache to reuse the image
[03:19:07] <Cork> hmm
[03:19:15] <Cork> actually, scratch that
[03:19:42] <Cork> it will make the browser do more work, but that is about it
[03:22:15] <mintmoney> the logoObj is passed to the server controller and used to authenticate, then the file is located and returned as logo
[03:22:31] <Cork> ya, i get that
[03:22:32] <mintmoney> logoObj contains no image
[03:22:49] <Cork> and it is a decent way to prevent others from accessing the image
[03:23:04] <Cork> but ajax adds no protection compared to just linking it in an img tag
[03:23:24] <sonda> hello ... has anybody used nv.d3.js for drawing charts
[03:23:57] <sonda> I am drawing chart on a gridster item... but the graph is going outside the item
[03:25:19] <Cork> mintmoney: to be clear 5 secs in the browsers network tab will give them the image anyway
[03:25:39] <mintmoney> as long as they pass in the id param
[03:25:46] <Cork> yes
[03:25:47] <mintmoney> and it matches their session data
[03:25:56] <Cork> and my point is, just put the url in an img tag
[03:26:05] <Cork> and let the browser render the image directly
[03:26:10] <mintmoney> so why is it displaying just a string! lol... i will try putting it right in the image tab
[03:26:13] <Cork> it will be just as secure
[03:26:13] <mintmoney> tag**
[03:28:21] <mintmoney> Cork: I LOVE YOUUUUU
[03:28:24] <mintmoney> I LOVE YOUUUUU
[03:28:27] <mintmoney> LOVE YOU!!!
[03:28:29] <mintmoney> lol
[03:28:32] <Cork> <_<'
[03:28:37] <Cork> i guess that worked?
[03:28:42] <mintmoney> yes it did!
[03:28:45] <mintmoney> SO AWESOMEEEEE
[03:28:51] <mintmoney> thank your!
[03:28:55] <Cork> np
[03:29:08] <mintmoney> ugh what a headache for such a simple answer lol
[03:29:29] <Kamuela> sorry for being your headache mintmoney :)
[03:29:45] <mintmoney> Kamuela: no not you, lol... thank you for the help as well!
[03:29:57] <mintmoney> i was just trying everything before even asking in here
[03:31:03] <mintmoney> i love that feeling of relief after you get all stressed out trying to solve some ridiculous problem, but it's better when I'm not the one creating the problem, still satisfying though lol
[03:32:19] <Kamuela> on your server side though, i guess the reason you're opening that readstream is just to make sure the file exists?
[03:33:01] <Kamuela> i think your node-dir module would check for that before though
[03:33:16] <mintmoney> yes, I can get rid of that I think
[03:33:17] <Kamuela> superfluous maybe
[03:34:49] <mintmoney> so that big long string of characters is called a Blob? lol
[03:36:57] <Kamuela> mintmoney: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_large_object
[03:38:16] <mintmoney> so cool!
[03:38:21] <mintmoney> thank you everyone!
[03:38:34] <mintmoney> especially Kamueal and Cork :)
[03:38:41] <mintmoney> Kamuela*

[04:12:17] <sauerkirsche> hello
[04:14:18] <sauerkirsche> How does one go about writing jQuery alongside non-jquery code? Is the done-thing to adopt object oriented style programming?
[04:15:09] <sauerkirsche> putting all your objects properties and methods inside of a global object perhaps?
[04:22:50] <Cork> sauerkirsche: you normally don't need to do anything to use jquery along side things
[04:23:02] <Cork> unless the original code depends on a framework that uses $
[04:35:10] <jeffreylevesque> Is mime type validation in forms not recommended?
[04:35:48] <taplar> what do you mean?
[04:37:02] <jeffreylevesque> I had problems with https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/issues/2081#issuecomment-138741936
[04:37:12] <jeffreylevesque> So I just concluded that nothing can be done
[04:37:44] <jeffreylevesque> Unless I move all the validation logic to be solely server based and ajax it back to the front end
[04:37:56] <taplar> you mean validate the contents of a file?
[04:38:00] <taplar> based on it's mime type?
[04:38:05] <jeffreylevesque> Currently logic is front and back end
[04:38:09] <jeffreylevesque> Yeah
[04:38:13] <taplar> that's back end validation
[04:39:19] <jeffreylevesque> Should I add ajax to send validation to backend and return it to front end before form submission
[04:39:20] <taplar> typically what i have seen for front end is simply checking/restricting the extension, but interrogating the file to make sure it is what it is, is a backend operation
[04:39:50] <jeffreylevesque> The back end I do mime type and hash comparison
[04:39:52] <taplar> to validate it you'd have to send it, so not sure how much you'd save by sending it twice in a good case
[04:41:08] <jeffreylevesque> Yeah weird if I validate twice
[04:41:26] <jeffreylevesque> Wonder what I should do
[04:55:51] <Duikb00t> Hi I have a problem https://gist.github.com/duikb00t/bab740bf1283adfda930  I am using that code to scroll to anchors in my website which works perfect
[04:56:01] <Duikb00t> But I need to add some more offset because I am using a fixed header.
[04:56:17] <Duikb00t> scrollTop: 150 + target.offset().top  is for example not working.
[04:56:34] <Duikb00t> I need that so I can see my titles again from the sections where I am scrolling to. Has someone a suggestion how I can fix that?
[04:56:56] <Cork> Duikb00t: just add the height of the header to line 9
[04:57:10] <Cork> or subtract if that is the problem
[04:57:12] <bennieblanco> Any experienced JS dev here that can tackle parallax script issue ?  Will gladly pay for your time
[04:58:35] <bennieblanco> having trouble getting 60 FPS and something in the script is pausing the scroll ,  http://prntscr.com/8e1dmf http://prntscr.com/8e1e14
[04:58:50] <Duikb00t> As in : scrollTop: target.offset().top + 100; Cork  ?
[05:01:17] <Duikb00t> Fixed it thanks!
[05:01:36] <Duikb00t> It was indeed minus 100 instead +
[05:21:40] <sweet2k4> how do i add a varible to a query selector $id = 12 $("panel-+$id").hide(); ??
[05:22:40] <taplar> you can concatenate a variable to a string with +.  "something"+ variable
[05:23:19] <sweet2k4> taplar: so how would that look with the example above?
[05:23:44] <taplar> var id = 12; $("panel"+ id).hide();
[05:24:01] <taplar> but your panel isn't prefixed with # or . so i'm not sure it will find anything
[05:24:48] <sweet2k4> yeah, forgot the #, but would this work? $id = 12; $("#panel"+ $id).hide();
[05:25:06] <taplar> sure, but don't use the $ on the id.  12 is not a jquery object
[05:26:02] <sweet2k4> oh ok. now i get it, thanks for the help dude!
[05:26:16] <taplar> sure
[05:26:49] <Cork> taplar: many use $ for every varaible (as if it was php)
[05:27:14] <taplar> o.O
[05:27:22] <Cork> personally i never use it
[05:27:23] <taplar> i can see that i guess
[05:28:07] <Cork> it feels like it's getting more common too
[05:28:27] <taplar> i use it, but only for jquery vars
[05:28:50] <Cork> i mean name variables like you would in php, is getting more common
[05:29:01] <taplar> ah
[05:29:12] <Cork> for(var $i = 0;$i < 100;$i++) {}
[05:29:26] <Cork> makes me irk
[05:29:31] <taplar> heh
[05:49:35] <Twirl> anyone using jquery cycle? looks broken af?
[06:06:34] <Pazician> Hello everyone. I don't get why this doesn't work: http://pastebin.com/b7xJvzd8 What I want is that when I click on the fa icon it should pop up an dialog called .project-info and it should be the specific one that's inside the article, so I should use the $(this), but I can't really get it to work out
[06:08:32] <taplar> so the fadein is not working?
[06:09:27] <Pazician> taplar: I guess, it worked fine before - but then it loaded the same all the time, I want to use the $(this) to get the specific one that's inside the post
[06:12:58] <taplar> well one thing, lines 10-12 are executing every time you fade in.  you probably want to do that outside so you only bind once
[06:15:24] <Pazician> taplar: You mean like this? http://pastebin.com/9t0na0Wp
[06:16:55] <taplar> if you can click the icon multiple times, it would also be binding multiple times there too
[06:17:42] <Pazician> taplar: Could you possible rewrite it so I can understand what you mean?
[06:18:10] <Pazician> taplar: It's currently not working, it doesn't trigger anything
[06:19:30] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/qvygryy7/
[06:21:14] <taplar> btw, what is projInfo?  I see it used but not defined
[06:22:05] <Pazician> taplar: I use it to get the element relative to the body http://pastebin.com/ffFwkGX8
[06:22:36] <taplar> o_O
[06:22:42] <taplar> k
[06:22:59] <taplar> so
[06:23:04] <Pazician> taplar: I get a zero in the console, but nothing happenes
[06:23:05] <taplar> that element does not belong to the icon
[06:23:14] <taplar> so the find doesn't find anything
[06:23:50] <Pazician> taplar: This is the HTML: http://pastebin.com/K2VqMQku
[06:23:58] <taplar> no, you just moved it to the body
[06:24:11] <taplar> you found it and appended it to the body
[06:24:15] <taplar> it no longer is nested
[06:24:36] <taplar> regardless of where it was
[06:24:59] <Pazician> taplar: I don't understand what you mean, are you talking about the .project-info variable?
[06:25:24] <taplar> yes, you found them all, and appended them to body.  that moved them out of any nesting and directly under body
[06:25:41] <taplar> so the $(this).find() will not find it
[06:25:45] <taplar> unless 'this' is body
[06:28:06] <Pazician> taplar: Ugh, you're right! How can I make the variable relate to the body - it has to pop-out and then be like a dialog, if you understand what I mean? It's now realting to the article
[06:29:11] <taplar> well first, why are you moving them?
[06:30:03] <Pazician> taplar: Bcuz I want that section to be like a pop-up dialog
[06:30:13] <Pazician> .project-info
[06:30:55] <taplar> you can make anything like a popup dialog
[06:31:06] <Kartagis> any difference between .trim().val() and .val().trim() ?
[06:31:11] <taplar> it's nesting doesn't really matter, unless it affects placement on the screen
[06:31:46] <taplar> Kartagis: val().trim() would be more appropriate
[06:31:52] <taplar> your trimming a string
[06:32:22] <taplar> trim() should return a string, so val() should be unnecessary and also undefined
[06:32:51] <Pazician> taplar: The thing is, it relates to the article which is 4/3 in columns, and bcuz I use transform effects on the article I've set the property to overflow:hidden;
[06:33:05] <taplar> ah
[06:33:17] <taplar> crap
[06:33:43] <Pazician> Yeah...
[06:34:01] <taplar> ok, what i would suggest then is put some sort of data attribute on the element to relate them to the parent icon
[06:34:23] <taplar> or you could put a reference to the associated dialog as a prop on the icon
[06:35:00] <Pazician> taplar: I'm not really following here, what you mean?
[06:35:35] <taplar> so if you went the prop route you could do something to initialize like
[06:35:56] <taplar> ah, let me put this in the fiddle
[06:36:16] <Pazician> Alright, thanks so much for taking your time, bud!
[06:37:45] <Twirl> anyone using jquery cycle?
[06:38:44] <Pazician> I'm not
[06:38:45] <taplar> Pazician: http://jsfiddle.net/qvygryy7/1/
[06:39:25] <taplar> so the idea here is to get the icon that is related to the specific dialog, move it, and then attach the reference to the element on the icon
[06:39:44] <taplar> then later when you want to use it, you can reference prop('dialog') to get the related dialog to work with
[06:43:26] <Pazician> taplar: The "dialog" kinda looking is the .project-info and that's the one I want to pop-up like a dialog looking section. But I still can't get it to work out, I don't really follow either what you're trying to explain, sorry

[07:07:46] <crisumi> if i'm wanting to manipulate an SVG and have access to the svg code for export-- what is the best library to use in your opinion? (your being anyone!)
[07:08:55] <Cork> crisumi: you can always export the svg
[07:09:05] <Cork> it is just about serializing the dom tree
[07:09:08] <crisumi> really? hmmmm
[07:09:16] <Cork> what you might lose is interaction
[07:09:25] <Cork> depending on how they do that
[07:09:26] <crisumi> interaction? how so?
[07:09:41] <Cork> well if it is javascript hooked in to the svg
[07:09:44] <crisumi> and so does this mean that other svg plugins just make it "easier" to export with some api?
[07:09:47] <Cork> exporting the dom won't capture that
[07:09:53] <fas3r> I'm trying to implement the example from bootstrap-table. I have a problem with the function "operateEvents". It define on window.operateEvents ( line 195 ) ... somebody could tell me what could be wrong please ? it's complaining that operateEvents is not present... Here is the example :  https://github.com/wenzhixin/bootstrap-table-examples/blob/master/welcome.html   thanks by advance.
[07:10:15] <Cork> crisumi: ya
[07:10:25] <crisumi> Cork, so using Js to manipulate the svg won't allow me to export those changes? or are you saying something else?
[07:10:36] <Cork> something else
[07:10:42] <ravigehlot> I am getting into QUnit for the first time. How should I do unit testing? Should I set up 2 different projects with 1 having unit testing and the other being the actual project?
[07:10:45] <Cork> for example if the plugin binds a click handler on the svg
[07:11:02] <Cork> that js code that does does things on click might be hard to export
[07:11:25] <Cork> but if the svg is just an image, exporting isn't hard
[07:11:29] <crisumi> Cork, oh ok. yeah won't need any of that :)
[07:11:45] <crisumi> i'm attempting to generate like a coupon or even a small menu that allows me to add items to it, etc
[07:11:53] <crisumi> i'm just so lost as to what the best method is
[07:14:00] <taplar> ravigehlot: one argument would be to have your qunit in your project, that way it is version controlled along with your proje ct
[07:14:56] <ravigehlot> taplar: that's right..Also, I should keep it all together...the actual JS should contain the testing units.
[07:15:26] <taplar> uh, i dunno i would go that far
[07:15:36] <ravigehlot> taplar: so how is it suppose to be done?
[07:16:00] <taplar> i mean you could, but if your doing any sort of project that compiles a release, your build could be made to exclude the tests from the production site
[07:16:06] <taplar> no need for the users to see your tests
[07:16:20] <ravigehlot> taplar: you are right
[07:16:47] <taplar> things to think about, :)
[07:17:27] <ravigehlot> taplar: Should I keep one separate JS with all the testing units and then just strip out the test units to create the public js file?
[07:18:34] <taplar> been a bit since i played with qunit, but i'm assuming it's similar to jasminejs.  so in that aspect, what we usually do is have a src folder with out real code and a sibling folder tests with all the individual files with the tests for each related actual js code file
[07:18:45] <taplar> the test page includes both the sources and test files
[07:19:02] <taplar> your build script could then ignore the test folder
[07:19:31] <Twirl> Hi, anyone familiar with jquery cycle?
[07:19:56] <ravigehlot> taplar: oh see
[07:20:03] <ravigehlot> taplar: oh I see
[07:22:01] <ravigehlot> taplar: taplar: So in TDD, I will write the test first on my tests/ folder. That test should then fail because there is no actual implementation of it. On my src/ folder, I create the actual code to be tested. Then the test should pass if all is okay.
[07:22:18] <taplar> yep
[07:23:37] <ravigehlot> taplar: How do I assert.ok on a synchronous callback function. For example, I want to assert that the callback was called. The only way that I can think of doing that is by having assert.ok(true, 'yay'); inside of the function itself. But how would I do that if the tests are separate from the actual code?
[07:24:09] <taplar> i would assume quint would have some manner of mocking function calls
[07:24:38] <taplar> so your not actually making the call
[07:24:59] <taplar> you can verify it would call it with the correct parameters, and then you could verify the separate callbacks
[07:25:06] <ravigehlot> taplar: right. I would have to add a Mocking plugin for QUnit: https://qunitjs.com/plugins/
[07:25:38] <ravigehlot> taplar: How do you automate testing units?
[07:25:40] <taplar> mocking is very nice, imho.  it helps to keep your tests self contained
[07:25:49] <ravigehlot> taplar: in the case of QUnit
[07:26:01] <ravigehlot> taplar: I see
[07:26:12] <taplar> i can't speak for qunit.  not intimately familiar with that testing toolsuite
[07:26:40] <ravigehlot> taplar: how about JasmineJS
[07:26:52] <taplar> that i can give you an example of
[07:27:03] <taplar> https://github.com/taplar/site-editor/tree/master/public/scripts
[07:27:15] <taplar> and https://github.com/taplar/site-editor/blob/master/tests.html
[07:27:32] <taplar> bbs, i gotta go hit up a meeting
[07:27:43] <ravigehlot> taplar: Hey buddy, thanks for the info!
[07:27:49] <taplar> np, hope it helps
[07:28:00] <ravigehlot> taplar: it did help a lot actually!
[07:28:04] <ravigehlot> taplar: ttyl
[07:28:26] <taplar> the root of that github project also has a link to a test staging site where you can see the live tests if you want
[07:28:39] <taplar> it may take a bit to start as it's a cloud site that may have to spin up
[07:28:40] <NoiseEee> comma-first!
[07:28:49] <ravigehlot> taplar: That's great info. I know that you gootta go. So I ttyl and thanks again.
[07:28:55] <taplar> yup, *runs*

[07:58:43] <Twirl> Hello, if i have var a = element; (element is a div with stuff in it) and i want to change the style to it, tried a.attr("style", "css"); and it didn't work, how can i do this?
[08:00:18] <Duikb00t> What was again the package where I can easy setup forms in laravel?
[08:00:30] <Duikb00t> And which had support to determine on which field an error occurs.
[08:00:36] <Duikb00t> Yesterday someone told me. :D
[08:01:01] <mentoc> Duikb00t: was it this perhaps? http://laravelcollective.com/docs/5.0/html
[08:01:34] <VectorX> hi, i need to create a search box where you got a icon and when click the search opens, is there some easy to do examples i can implement ?
[08:03:18] <Duikb00t> mentoc thanks I guess it was that, probably a stupid question but why in the docs to they write echo Form::open(array('route' => 'route.name')) instead of {!! !!}
[08:11:20] <zumba_ad_> what could be the issue - So an ajax call was made when api was unreachable. Request is showing as pending in Chrome's network tab. Before chrome decides to fail it, the api went back online and the pending changed to 200 OK. It went inside the .done but data isn't good
[08:22:23] <zumba_ad_> good morning folks, I wasn't sure if my post made it earlier since I wasn't identified in freenode
[08:22:27] <zumba_ad_> here it is again

[08:25:11] <zumba_ad_> i'm thinking that api doesn't know what I requested
[08:25:30] <zumba_ad_> i'm not sure if ajax has a mechanism to resend those pending request

[08:27:12] <robertmaxrees> which part doesn't work?  the event binding?
[08:27:13] <robertmaxrees> ooor...?
[08:28:42] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: I get wrong password the first time
[08:29:03] <Kartagis> I can login with the same creds the 2nd time
[08:29:14] <Kartagis> 3rd time, wrong password
[08:29:21] <robertmaxrees> so it's wrong every other time?
[08:29:54] <robertmaxrees> check your network tab - see what that has to say.

[08:34:13] <Kartagis> red lines are first and third time I push the login button without changing anything
[08:35:11] <robertmaxrees> that looks like a server issue.
[08:37:51] <Kartagis> but why doesn't it work every other time?
[08:38:04] <robertmaxrees> dunno!
[08:50:18] <sadmicrowave> @Kartagis is it always first and third times? How many times have you tested?
[09:00:00] <geoid> greetz
[09:00:40] <taplar> whoo hoo, meetings rule!
[09:00:56] <geoid> I'm having some trouble selecting a dynamic element from within a .click event. The dynamic element doesn't exist at the time the click event is defined but it does exist at the time the event is called. Is there a way to defer selection until the event is triggered?
[09:01:26] <taplar> sure, select it inside the click handler
[09:02:02] <geoid> taplar I've done that but it is not working. I can select the event from the command line but not within the click handler.
[09:02:14] <taplar> select the event?
[09:02:17] <sadmicrowave> @geoid lets see some example code
[09:02:25] <geoid> taplar sorry, the element
[09:02:44] <taplar> if within the event handler you do $(selector).length and you get 0 it does not exist
[09:02:58] <geoid> sadmicrowave that's gonna be tough... it's a complicated page :'(
[09:03:28] <geoid> taplar that's precisely what's happening. But I'm certain that the element exists at the time of the click.
[09:03:43] <sadmicrowave> ok, well then all we can do is speculate.  But @taplar is on the right path.  You need to test to see if the element exists within the click function at time of execution to prevent errors
[09:03:46] <geoid> ... because I can see it on the page before I click.
[09:03:58] <taplar> if you do believe it exists and your getting 0, double check your selector
[09:04:03] <sadmicrowave> and yet the click function says it doesn't?
[09:04:10] <geoid> sadmicrowave yes
[09:04:23] <geoid> taplar I've done that... copied and pasted it to the command line and it works there.
[09:04:48] <sadmicrowave> hmm, I would double check your selector then because it sounds like something in your code is wrong
[09:07:59] <sadmicrowave> actually, +1 to @taplar for saying the exact same thing just beating me to it
[09:08:22] <taplar> yes!  i'm now up to 2!
[09:08:26] <taplar> ^_^
[09:08:53] <taplar> wait, robert -5'ed me the other day.  $@!%
[09:08:56] <sadmicrowave> only 98 to go until HERO status
[09:10:02] <adv_> anyone knows how to console.log something when fancybox arrows are clicked?
[09:11:05] <sadmicrowave> @adv_ edit the fancybox source to add console.log command?
[09:11:26] <adv_> no i just want to perform an action when the arrow is clicked
[09:11:32] <adv_> but can't get it working
[09:13:17] <sadmicrowave> maybe add a click function override for the fancybox button in your own .js file on document.ready?
[09:14:29] <sadmicrowave> or do you already have that?
[09:15:00] <sweet2k4> is there something similar to var_dump for javascript to se datatype of a varible?
[09:15:25] <taplar> typeof object
[09:15:35] <sadmicrowave> @sweet2k4 console.log( typeof object )
[09:15:41] <sadmicrowave> @sweet2k4 console.log( typeof myVar )
[09:16:03] <sadmicrowave> @taplar damn you and your fast fingers
[09:16:15] <taplar> lmao, sorry, no comment
[09:16:18] <sadmicrowave> ha
[09:16:20] <sweet2k4> var test ='test'; console.log(typeof test); ?
[09:16:27] <sadmicrowave> yes
[09:16:38] <sweet2k4> Alright il try that, thanks
[09:16:43] <sadmicrowave> you can alert it too if you'd rather
[09:16:54] <taplar> there are also jquery utility functions like $.isArray and $.isFunction
[09:17:04] <taplar> $.isPlainObject
[09:17:06] <taplar> etc
[09:19:50] <XYZ1237> if my form id is my-form shouldn't this work?????     $('#my-form').on('submit', function() {
[09:19:51] <XYZ1237>         alert('fdfsdfd');
[09:19:51] <XYZ1237>     });
[09:20:08] <claytonzaugg> What can I do to this code to make the toggle switches responsive? If you drag the vertical bar left and right, you can see the switch lose its shape. http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ahadbsr8/2/
[09:20:39] <taplar> XYZ1237: looks valid
[09:22:55] <sadmicrowave> @taplar but doesn't the form submit action get executed first before the callback? So, if the page is redirected from the action then the callback won't ever get executed
[09:23:30] <taplar> no the event will fire first, giving you the chance to cancel the event and prevent it
[09:23:40] <sadmicrowave> with a return false; thats true ok
[09:23:45] <sadmicrowave> just checking
[09:23:45] <taplar> no, don't do that
[09:23:51] <AliG1000> Hi - if pull in content into a tab using Ajax like this https://jqueryui.com/tabs/#ajax, do I also pull in the jQuery on that page?  For example, if I pull in a filterable table, do I pull in the jQuery to create the filters from the sub-page or does the jQuery need to be on the main/master page?
[09:23:53] <taplar> use the preventDefault, don't return false
[09:24:03] <sadmicrowave> just preference though right?
[09:24:18] <taplar> i'm forgetting the exact reason for that, but it's not recommended
[09:24:21] <geoid> looks like it's an event timing problem... setTimeout fixed it.
[09:24:32] <sadmicrowave> gotcha
[09:24:36] <sadmicrowave> @geoid hollar!
[09:25:20] * Kartagis cheers sadmicrowave: "there there"
[09:25:31] <AliG1000> did my question make sense? :)
[09:26:29] <sweet2k4> another quick question, how to i console.log strlenght of a varible?
[09:27:01] <sadmicrowave> sweet2k4 console.log( myVar.length )?
[09:27:02] <Kartagis> sweet2k4: console.log(var.strlen())
[09:27:08] <taplar> stringobject.length
[09:27:14] <taplar> it's a property of the object
[09:27:14] <Kartagis> or length, yeah
[09:27:22] <taplar> for a basic string
[09:27:33] <geoid> AliG1000 can be in the sub-page but be sure to use a "document onready" wrapper.
[09:27:35] <AliG1000> what I am trying to find out is if all the jQuery for every interaction on every tab needs to be in the main page, or if I can call in the content (plus jQuery) for the sub-page
[09:27:36] <sadmicrowave> @taplar aHA, beat you that time
[09:27:47] <taplar> :P
[09:27:47] <sweet2k4> $test.length, yeah now i remeber
[09:27:54] <sweet2k4> thanks again guys!
[09:28:09] <Kartagis> does encodeURIComponent encode <space> to %20 and so on?
[09:28:21] <sadmicrowave> sweet2k4 google is your friend too with basic functions and syntax questions
[09:28:27] <AliG1000> @geoid on every sub-page?  or would the document onready be only on the master page?
[09:28:38] <taplar> uh, literal '<space>' or ' ' ?
[09:28:39] <sadmicrowave> @AliG1000 needs to be on every page
[09:28:42] <sweet2k4> sadmicrowave: true, il keep that i mind
[09:28:51] <Kartagis> taplar: ' '
[09:28:55] <AliG1000> ah ok
[09:28:58] <taplar> yes, that becomes 20%
[09:29:00] <claytonzaugg> What can I do to this code to make the toggle switches responsive? If you drag the vertical bar left and right, you can see the switch lose its shape. http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ahadbsr8/2/
[09:29:04] <taplar> %20 even
[09:29:07] <AliG1000> thank you :)
[09:29:07] <Kartagis> uhm
[09:29:10] <geoid> AliG1000 be aware that if you have multiple onready blocks they will execute in the order in which they are included.
[09:29:30] <AliG1000> good to know.  I will try to find an example
[09:29:53] <Kartagis> so that's why http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/dx4w0b9m/1/ didn't work on mobile
[09:30:22] <Kartagis> because it attempted to autocomplete and I let it
[09:35:30] <XYZ1237> how do youcall a method within js? is it this.functionName()?
[09:36:08] <taplar> how is your method defined?
[09:36:30] <sadmicrowave> @claytonzaugg, in your css for `input.toggle-round-flat + label` change your padding-bottom from a percentage to a fixed pixel
[09:36:43] <sadmicrowave> give it 20 px and see what it does
[09:37:01] <XYZ1237> http://laravel.io/bin/0ebyG
[09:37:22] <claytonzaugg> But I am trying to make it responsive, doesn't adding a set pixel destroy that?
[09:37:23] <sadmicrowave> ooOooOo laravel, hello old friend
[09:37:37] <sadmicrowave> @claytonzaugg thats what media queries are for
[09:38:06] <taplar> you don't have to define your functions in the load function, and it may not be a good idea to do that anyway as the scope will be limited to that function i believe
[09:38:15] <sadmicrowave> for the selectors and styles you can't make responsive with percentages, use media queries for different resolutions
[09:38:16] <taplar> in any case, defining a function like that you just name() it
[09:38:43] <claytonzaugg> true sadmicrowave
[09:38:44] <XYZ1237> thanks!
[09:38:48] <sadmicrowave> @claytonzaugg but this is a css question, you might get a better response in a css room
[09:39:39] <claytonzaugg> I've been trying, I'll keep at it though!  Thanks for your time though, I appreciate it
[09:39:45] <sadmicrowave> word
[09:43:19] <Twirl> hi, how do i select the nth descendant?
[09:44:47] <claytonzaugg> Twirl, https://api.jquery.com/nth-last-child-selector/ or https://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[09:45:07] <Drewery> How can I make this code so, when I hover it will only replace the classes for that specific box I am hover on : http://jsfiddle.net/13ssu8va/
[09:45:16] <Drewery> any help is appreciated, thanks in advance
[09:46:15] <Twirl> claytonzaugg: nope, i have an index (a number) and i need to pass that to the parent or something i can't select by class or w/e
[09:46:45] <claytonzaugg> Drewery, have you tried using $(this) at all to scope only to the thing you're hovering over?
[09:47:08] <Drewery> claytonzaugg: I have been thinking about it
[09:47:21] <Drewery> but I couldn't figure out how to factor this into this code
[09:47:42] <Twirl> claytonzaugg: i have jQuery(element).index(this); // returns a number, all i have is the element
[09:48:01] <Drewery> index(this)...
[09:48:14] <Gjiliu> <span class="jtable-page-info">Mostrando registros 1 a 10 de 69</span>
[09:48:19] <Twirl> claytonzaugg: so i would like to do something like element.parent().children(jQuery(element).index(this);
[09:48:30] <Gjiliu> how can I get just the 10 numer of that text() tag?
[09:48:31] <Twirl> Drewery: yea but i need index -1
[09:48:58] <claytonzaugg> Twirl, I have to split for a bit, sorry, but try and get another on here to help out.
[09:49:01] <Drewery> Twirl: sorry for the confusion, I was thinking if index(this) could solve my problem
[09:49:09] <claytonzaugg> Drewery, I gotta split, sorry, try and get another here to help out
[09:49:29] <Twirl> Drewery: i don't know about ur problem
[09:49:45] <Drewery> Twirl: http://jsfiddle.net/13ssu8va/
[09:49:57] <Twirl> Drewery: sorry man i'm working on my own problem
[09:49:59] <Drewery> I am just trying to target the one I am hovering
[09:50:00] <Twirl> xD
[09:50:21] <robertmaxrees> what's going on?
[09:50:28] <decx> add this as context
[09:50:32] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:50:37] <decx> also scrap all this and use css
[09:50:44] <decx> :hover is fine
[09:50:49] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[09:50:56] <decx> only thing you need js for is a touch fallback
[09:51:43] <Drewery> decx: but I want to target the whole wrapper box as a hover element, however I have two different styling values for the title and the content, how would you target wrapper as an hover element and change the values for the title and the content in css
[09:52:14] <robertmaxrees> Drewery .wrapper:hover .title { }
[09:52:32] <Drewery> of course
[09:52:34] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: the reasone that login wasn't working every other time was because of encodeURIComponent, hence spaces being encoded to %20
[09:52:35] <robertmaxrees> .wrapper:hover .content { }
[09:52:42] <Kartagis> reason
[09:52:52] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis why did that break over other time though?
[09:53:08] <Kartagis> not a clue
[09:53:17] <Drewery> hey thanks guys, I feel extremely stupid when answers are sitting in your brain and you get tangled over simple stuff
[09:53:34] <decx> btw, having separate classes is too verbose
[09:53:36] <taplar> s happens
[09:53:50] <Kartagis> funny creature, jquery is
[09:53:50] <decx> like isntead of title-hover and content-hover it should be wrapper-hover
[09:54:05] <decx> regardless of css :hover being better
[09:54:29] <Drewery> decx: I think I won't need any of those now, I will just target them under hover status
[09:54:41] <decx> yeah you dont, just something to think about
[09:54:44] <Drewery> decx: robertmaxrees thanks guys!
[09:54:57] <Drewery> decx: definitely, I appreciate the touch up!
[09:55:55] <decx> anytime you repeat nearly the same line in code it's worth thinking about why that other line is necessary
[09:56:47] <Drewery> yeah one should go DRY
[09:59:54] <adv_> for some reason i can't get lazyload.js to work
[10:00:08] <adv_> it keeps loading all the lazy images, without me telling so
[10:00:33] <adv_> i have a click event to load the lazy images and they get loaded anyway
[10:00:39] <adv_> anyone knows why?
[10:00:51] <robertmaxrees> show us your code.
[10:00:58] <robertmaxrees> i have a hunch but i'd have to see your code to confirm :)
[10:04:22] <adv_> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.ca/3156890
[10:04:59] <Zzaichik> Hey, this looks like it could be done in a way cleaner way - any advice? http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/xtntgLhv/
[10:05:47] <robertmaxrees> adv_ check your consol.
[10:05:52] <robertmaxrees> *console - any errors?
[10:06:04] <decx> dont have lookups in an event called by scroll Zzaichik
[10:06:12] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:06:30] <adv_> robertmaxrees: no errors
[10:06:35] <Zzaichik> Can you show me what you mean decx?
[10:06:44] <robertmaxrees> var $body = $('body');
[10:06:48] <robertmaxrees> outside of the function.
[10:06:49] <decx> precache the body, .featured and header selectors
[10:07:02] <decx> in a scope above your scroll event
[10:07:24] <Zzaichik> I see.
[10:07:30] <robertmaxrees> should be able to do $('.featured-brands-slide').position().top; outside of that, as well.
[10:07:37] <adv_> robertmaxrees: may i clarify that the images are already in view, i just want to defer loading until the user clicks or mouseovers
[10:08:00] <adv_> and the experience i have with lazyload.js so far is about images not being in view yet
[10:08:14] <robertmaxrees> adv_ so you want to change when they load?
[10:08:41] <robertmaxrees> because your image tags are wrong.
[10:08:42] <robertmaxrees> <img class="lazy" data-original="img/example.jpg" width="640" height="480">
[10:08:50] <adv_> what is wrong
[10:08:51] <robertmaxrees> wait... maybe not.
[10:09:37] <Zzaichik> decx: so you're saying more like this? http://jsfiddle.net/ZzaichikK/xtntgLhv/1/
[10:10:00] <robertmaxrees> adv_ something here seems funky to me.  can you make a fiddle for this?
[10:10:03] <decx> that's it Zzaichik
[10:10:12] <Zzaichik> nice, I gotcha. Thanks man!
[10:10:19] <taplar> the extra wrapper at the bottom is unnecessary
[10:10:35] <decx> it's because dom lookups are relatively expensive and scroll happens a lot
[10:10:35] <taplar> fwiw
[10:10:49] <robertmaxrees> taplar is right -that could be just $(window).scroll(minimizeHeader);
[10:12:07] <Zzaichik> I see
[10:12:09] <adv_> robertmaxrees: ok
[10:12:09] <Zzaichik> okay
[10:13:48] <taplar> also could the if else for the add/remove class be changed to toggleClass(..., boolean) ?
[10:13:59] <robertmaxrees> i personally avoid using toggles
[10:14:22] <taplar> readability?
[10:15:00] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[10:17:10] <adv_> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/756em9ot/
[10:18:17] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:18:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost.
[10:19:12] <taplar> lol, the images are all flipping if you continuously hover over it
[10:19:17] <adv_> robertmaxrees: :( why?
[10:19:29] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[10:19:30] <adv_> taplar: that is the wanted thing
[10:19:41] <adv_> expected*
[10:19:43] <taplar> it's like i'm on acid
[10:19:47] <adv_> lol
[10:20:01] <adv_> robertmaxrees: so i have the image scrubber ok ?
[10:20:11] <robertmaxrees> why?
[10:20:21] <adv_> huh? because i like it
[10:20:49] <adv_> but i don't want the rest of the images to load until the user enters that area
[10:21:17] <adv_> so i use "lazy" class on them to defer loading of those images until the user has clicked on that item
[10:21:32] <adv_> (or mouseover but let's use click for the example)
[10:21:56] <adv_> the problem is that they all load together and no "lazy" loading is taking place
[10:22:11] <robertmaxrees> actually, you didn't read the docs :)
[10:22:19] <robertmaxrees> skip_invisible : true - need this.
[10:23:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing.
[10:23:27] <adv_> robertmaxrees: well just tried, same thing http://jsfiddle.net/756em9ot/3/
[10:23:29] <taplar> can i also say that, imho, it's kinda strange that your binding to two events, and inside checking which one happened to know what to do, both being relatively large blocks of work.  personally i'd segregate them
[10:23:31] <robertmaxrees> lazyload is doing exactly what it's supposed to, fwiw - it's only loading images in the viewport.
[10:23:54] <adv_> taplar: you mean mousemove and mouseleave?
[10:23:58] <taplar> yeah
[10:24:14] <robertmaxrees> adv_ you need to hide those images somehow.
[10:24:22] <adv_> taplar: that part was already done and i have no problem with it. the lazy stuff is the problem
[10:24:50] <adv_> robertmaxrees: is there something else that i can use?
[10:25:00] <robertmaxrees> adv_ lazyload is loading images currently in the viewport - you need to use css to display: none; them i'm guessing.
[10:25:02] <adv_> that better fits what i want to do
[10:25:07] <robertmaxrees> or build this out.
[10:25:11] <robertmaxrees> like, by hand.
[10:25:20] <robertmaxrees> the images aren't all that big though.
[10:25:35] <adv_> robertmaxrees: it's 90 * 10 image
[10:25:36] <adv_> s
[10:25:43] <adv_> this is just a fiddle with 1* 10 images
[10:25:49] <robertmaxrees> and you compressed each image down?
[10:25:56] <adv_> compressed means?
[10:26:11] <robertmaxrees> use imagemagick on them.
[10:26:24] <adv_> gzip or convert -quality ?
[10:27:01] <adv_> yes i used imagemagick on them, but they're 3mb all together
[10:27:10] <adv_> >3mb
[10:27:18] <taplar> is the path to the images consistent with the pattern in the fiddle?
[10:27:21] <robertmaxrees> so 90 images are 3 megs?
[10:27:22] <adv_> yes
[10:27:28] <robertmaxrees> that's not terrible.
[10:27:46] <taplar> you could potentially build the list dynamically, giving it just the number of elements, create them, hide them, and then append them
[10:28:06] <adv_> robertmaxrees: yeah but i want to avoid loading those and dynamically loading them when the user hovers on top of that item
[10:28:31] <adv_> taplar: didn't get that
[10:28:41] <robertmaxrees> then wire that yourself.
[10:28:46] <adv_> how?
[10:29:31] <robertmaxrees> kill lazyload.  on mouseenter of that <a>, .each() through the images and copy their .data('original') to the .attr('src')
[10:30:24] <adv_> can you do a fiddle?
[10:30:33] <robertmaxrees> what about that are you not understanding?
[10:30:56] <adv_> i do but i'm new to js
[10:31:05] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:31:07] <robertmaxrees> so try :)
[10:31:40] <adv_> also how do i disable the scrubber on mobile devices?
[10:31:53] <robertmaxrees> focus on the first part for now.
[10:32:10] <adv_> you'll be away afterwards and i won't have an answer
[10:32:11] <adv_> lol
[10:32:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:32:24] <adv_> for the 2nd part
[10:32:44] <robertmaxrees> you're going to confuse yourself more - focus on one thing at a time.
[10:32:47] <adv_> should i use mouseenter or mouseover?
[10:32:57] <robertmaxrees> mouseenter for this one.
[10:34:53] <fas3r> why this example is working on jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/wenyi/e3nk137y/39/  but, when I try it on my server I get "Uncaught ReferenceError: operateEvents is not defined" ...
[10:35:55] <robertmaxrees> you're not loading that plugin before your code.
[10:36:29] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: yes I do, the table is render appropriatly.
[10:36:55] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: do you mean that I should put window.operateEvents before I call the plugin ?
[10:37:01] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:37:08] <robertmaxrees> need to define it before you can use it
[10:37:11] <sadmicrowave> @Gjiliu, has anyone helped you yet?
[10:37:45] <fas3r> robertmaxrees: thx..
[10:37:48] <fas3r> it's working.
[10:37:50] <fas3r> ..
[10:37:58] <fas3r> thanks !
[10:37:59] <robertmaxrees> cool

[10:38:25] <anotheryou> hi. if i load jquery externally, do i have to wait for document ready until I can use it or does it just have to be loaded above in my html?
[10:38:30] <robertmaxrees> adv_ wat
[10:38:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/756em9ot/4/
[10:38:35] <adv_> no wait
[10:38:36] <robertmaxrees> like this yo
[10:39:46] <adv_> robertmaxrees: ah. but i'm getting 3012
[10:39:47] <adv_> 301*
[10:39:53] <adv_> along with the 200 requests
[10:40:02] <robertmaxrees> 301 is a server-side thing.
[10:40:11] <taplar> unmodified
[10:40:20] <robertmaxrees> 301 is a redirect.
[10:40:28] <taplar> crap, what's unmodified..
[10:40:55] <adv_> robertmaxrees: so it's a jsfiddle thing?
[10:41:00] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:41:03] <robertmaxrees> in what now?
[10:41:09] <robertmaxrees> taplar 304
[10:41:23] <adv_> robertmaxrees: in your fiddle, i'm getting double requests for each lazy img
[10:41:24] <sweet2k4> i cant understand this one: i use ajax to send some a varible with post to a .php file, the .php adds the varible value to my database and does nothing more. so far so good. but my success: function (response) in the ajax file returns a string of 4 spaces. why?
[10:41:25] <jeffreylevesque> is linting much much slower than checking mime type?
[10:41:26] <adv_> one 200 and one 301
[10:41:41] <taplar> ah, 04, X(
[10:42:10] <robertmaxrees> adv_ that's on lorem pixel's side.
[10:42:15] <adv_> oh yes
[10:42:20] <adv_> happens on the original one
[10:42:21] <adv_> too
[10:42:25] <robertmaxrees> it's redirecting from http://lorempixel.com/200/200/people/10 to http://lorempixel.com/200/200/people/10/
[10:42:39] <adv_> robertmaxrees: hey thanks a lot!! i guess that is the way to go
[10:43:02] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/756em9ot/6/
[10:43:06] <robertmaxrees> with no redirects.
[10:49:20] <adv_> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/756em9ot/9/
[10:49:33] <adv_> if i mouseenter people, i also get the animal images
[10:49:45] <robertmaxrees> so add context
[10:50:07] <robertmaxrees> get the child imgs of the current thumbscrubber
[10:50:27] <XYZ1237> for some reason this does not work http://laravel.io/bin/jQEP9 i tried jquery '#create-form' and submit() nothing
[10:50:44] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementById('create-form').on('submit', function() { .on() is apart of jquery.
[10:51:01] <robertmaxrees> you want $('#create-form').on('submit', function() { or jQuery('#create-form').on('submit', function() {
[10:52:01] <adv_> this.children().$('.lazy').each(function() {  ?
[10:52:11] <adv_> $this*
[10:52:18] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('img') would be better.
[10:52:25] <robertmaxrees> $this.children().$('.lazy') isn't anything.
[10:52:40] <robertmaxrees> actually, $(this).find('.lazy') would be better
[10:53:48] <adv_> thanks!
[10:54:01] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com - you'd do well to give this a run-through :)
[10:54:23] <adv_> robertmaxrees: what about the 2nd question?
[10:54:32] <robertmaxrees> what was the second question?
[10:56:09] <adv_>  how do i disable the scrubber on mobile devices?
[10:56:21] <robertmaxrees> those events will never fire.
[10:56:26] <robertmaxrees> there's no mouse on mobile.
[10:57:20] <adv_> so the lazy images won't get loaded on mobile?
[10:58:58] <adv_> robertmaxrees: ?
[10:59:09] <XYZ1237> ok
[10:59:24] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.
[11:03:35] <adv_> robertmaxrees: thanks!

[11:09:06] <OnceMe> can someone tell me why I cant put this in document).ready() http://pastebin.com/MndFCghH ?
[11:09:31] <robertmaxrees> what is it?
[11:09:33] <OnceMe> Im getting Uncaught SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list
[11:09:35] <robertmaxrees> and why do you want it in a doc ready?
[11:09:39] <OnceMe> thats lightbox plugin
[11:09:51] <robertmaxrees> why are you putting it in a doc ready?
[11:10:03] <OnceMe> so it can load before whole page loads
[11:10:05] <robertmaxrees> just link the plugin
[11:10:14] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make any sense.
[11:11:06] <OnceMe> robertmaxrees: https://github.com/lokesh/lightbox2/blob/master/dist/js/lightbox.min.js
[11:11:22] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question.
[11:11:38] <robertmaxrees> copy that and save it to a js file.  link the js file like any other after jquery.
[11:11:40] <robertmaxrees> done.
[11:11:42] <sadmicrowave> @Gjiliu you can do this: 'Mostrando registros 1 a 10 de 69'.split(/Mostrando registros\s|\sa\s|\sde\s/)
[11:13:23] <OnceMe> robertmaxrees:it wont work that way
[11:13:31] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[11:13:33] <OnceMe> unless I place that js plugin on the bottom of the page
[11:13:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:13:53] <OnceMe> ?
[11:14:03] <OnceMe> Thats why I want it in $(document).ready();
[11:14:16] <robertmaxrees> that till doesn't make sense.
[11:14:22] <robertmaxrees> that's not how that works.
[11:14:24] <robertmaxrees> http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/#getting-started
[11:14:29] <robertmaxrees> follow this.
[11:14:47] <OnceMe> I dont want to
[11:14:54] <OnceMe> I want to place this script at the top of my page
[11:14:58] <robertmaxrees> that tells you how to use it.
[11:14:59] <OnceMe> all in one js file
[11:15:04] <robertmaxrees> what you're doing now is not how you use it.
[11:15:08] <robertmaxrees> dunno how else to phrase that.
[11:15:52] <OnceMe> can I change code so it works how I want?
[11:15:55] <OnceMe> and what to change?
[11:15:58] <robertmaxrees> that's not a very good idea.
[11:16:01] <sadmicrowave> @OnceMe why can't you link it at the bottom of the page?
[11:16:04] <robertmaxrees> just follow the instructions.
[11:16:13] <robertmaxrees> and use it the way it's designed to be uysed.
[11:16:18] <sadmicrowave> lol
[11:16:53] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to change your markup as well fwiw.
[11:17:43] <robertmaxrees> since you'll need to include the js, the css, the images, and then the data attributes on the relevant tags.
[11:17:46] <sadmicrowave> does something break if you link it at the bottom, after body?
[11:18:02] <robertmaxrees> sadmicrowave linking it at the bottom of the page won't make it magically work.
[11:18:30] <sadmicrowave> no, it wont, I'm just trying to figure out why hes so against it
[11:18:56] <robertmaxrees> he keeps saying he wants the page to load before the plugin does, but that's not what document ready does.
[11:19:12] <sadmicrowave> because, we are in agreement, putting the raw in document.ready is not the solution
[11:19:20] <sadmicrowave> its not even A solution
[11:19:50] <robertmaxrees> right - he's having a problem and is assuming a particular solution.
[11:20:09] <sadmicrowave> haven't heard from him in a bit, he must be reading your link ;)

[14:39:06] <claytonzaugg> That's what I needed to know :)
[14:39:18] <claytonzaugg> I didn't know how to select the 2nd div, instead of the first
[14:39:34] <claytonzaugg> thanks nodist
[14:40:20] <decx> keep your selectors tight tho
[14:40:20] <nodist> np
[14:40:32] <decx> who's gonna want to maintain that
[14:42:47] <claytonzaugg> decx, perhaps I'll just add a class to make it be done with

[14:43:23] <decx> classes are classy
[14:50:01] <Zzaichik> If I want to toggle a classname on two elements, one of them can be $(this) is there a way to put them both in one selector and separate w/comma?
[14:50:11] <Zzaichik> $( this, 'element').toggleClass();
[14:50:30] <Zzaichik> ^that doesn't want to work
[14:50:43] <decx> that's for context and would translate to $('element').find(this)
[14:51:03] <Zzaichik> oh okay.
[14:51:03] <decx> use .add('selector') to add another element to a collection
[14:51:12] <Zzaichik> nice. thanks man
[14:52:04] <Zzaichik> perfect. I thought there had to be a better way than writing a whole new line of essentially the same code.

[15:27:07] <crit_commander> something like $('td').text() = 7
[15:27:17] <robertmaxrees> you want the text of each td?
[15:27:22] <crit_commander> the day cells for 7 and 9
[15:27:26] <robertmaxrees> or every TD whose text contains 7
[15:27:55] <crit_commander> yeah 7 or 9
[15:28:06] <robertmaxrees> use .filter() for that.
[15:28:44] <crit_commander> and write a filter that searches for 7 or 9
[15:28:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, check if .text().indexOf('7') > -1, etc.
[15:30:45] <YamakasY> yeah!
[15:30:46] <YamakasY> fixed
[15:30:55] * YamakasY is getting a pro
[15:31:03] <YamakasY> or becoming one actually
[15:33:00] <crit_commander> should I for or $.each through my cal_man_cells ?
[15:33:04] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:33:05] <robertmaxrees> use .filter()
[15:33:38] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/Lo9mnjt8/3/
[15:34:16] <crit_commander> oh I thought you had to supply a callback to .filter()
[15:34:30] <crit_commander> so I was going to each and if to find the tds
[15:35:43] <crit_commander> yeah that returned 7 9 and 27 I don't think indexOf will work
[15:36:32] <robertmaxrees> i did supply a callback to filter.
[15:36:36] <robertmaxrees> that's what the function is.
[15:36:43] <robertmaxrees> and you should get the idea from here.
[16:35:57] <Sal> hi
[16:36:18] <Sal> can someone tell me what the heck am i doing wrong here : http://jsfiddle.net/5qhfu9zo/
[16:36:36] <Sal> if you click open, it says that it doesn't find openpANEL()
[16:36:42] <Sal> openPanel()
[16:36:46] <Sal> but its there
[16:41:06] <robertmaxrees> because your js hasn't run yet.
[16:41:09] <robertmaxrees> use .on() instead.
[16:43:49] <Sal> i tried that too!
[16:43:54] <robertmaxrees> show me?
[16:44:01] <Sal> let me try again
[16:45:53] <Sal> http://jsfiddle.net/5qhfu9zo/4/
[16:45:58] <Sal> there
[16:47:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/5qhfu9zo/6/
[16:47:09] <robertmaxrees> don't use jquery edge if you can avoid it./
[16:47:16] <Sal> grr
[16:47:23] <Sal> why? what is edge for?
[16:47:33] <Sal> i thought it was the last version
[16:47:41] <robertmaxrees> bleeding edge.  may or may not work.
[16:47:52] <robertmaxrees> latest may or may not be verified to properly function :)
[16:47:58] <nodist> works with 2
[16:48:38] <Sal> ok, thanks
[16:50:20] <Sal> i usually use other playgounds because jsfiddle editors sometimes get crazy
[16:50:37] <robertmaxrees> i usually edit in Sublime Text and copy to jsfiddle.
[16:50:45] <Sal> :)
[16:50:54] <Sal> i would loive to use sublime text
[16:50:59] <robertmaxrees> then use it.
[16:51:25] <Sal> but i couldn't find someone or a doc tell me what plugins to use for web dev + php + xdebug
[16:52:31] <robertmaxrees> http://neverstopbuilding.com/sublime-plugins-for-php
[16:52:38] <Sal> also, i still don't have clear how to execute a webpage on my localhost
[16:52:48] <robertmaxrees> that's not what sublime does.
[16:52:59] <Sal> i got sublim 3
[16:53:01] <robertmaxrees> it's not an IDE.  just a kickass editor.
[16:53:04] <Sal> is 2 better?
[16:53:09] <robertmaxrees> 3 is great, too.
[16:53:13] <robertmaxrees> they're all great.
[16:53:43] <Sal> yes, but they told me that with the roght plugins, you can do almost everything a php ide can
[16:53:46] <Sal> aint that true?
[16:53:53] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:54:02] <Sal> i'm now using intellij
[16:54:12] <Sal> and want to leave it because too heavy
[16:54:19] <robertmaxrees> i like intellij, too.
[16:54:20] <robertmaxrees> depending.
[16:54:24] <Sal> i use only maybe 1% of the entire stuff
[16:54:52] <Sal> its takes too muck time to open and if you need to edit a single page, i need to use notepad++
[16:55:04] <robertmaxrees> that's what i use st for.
[16:55:10] <robertmaxrees> intellij when i need a server-side debugger.
[16:55:43] <Sal> hmmm, so the best way is just to keep on using both
[16:55:50] <robertmaxrees> they're tools.
[16:55:56] <Sal> yep
[16:56:04] <robertmaxrees> find what works best for you.
[16:56:22] <Sal> are those plugins good for st3 too?
[16:56:27] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[16:56:34] <robertmaxrees> i don't use 3 and i don't do php dev.
[16:59:15] <Sal> ok, thansk
[16:59:28] <Sal> i'll find the way now that i know the names of the plugins
[16:59:32] <Sal> :)
[16:59:39] <robertmaxrees> try experimenting around.
[16:59:48] <robertmaxrees> also: package control is amazing.
[17:22:31] <mentoc> robertmaxrees: I gotta say thank you for all the hard work you put into IRC man. Every time I've had a problem, you've been the one to help.
[17:27:04] <robertmaxrees> hey, i'm happy to do it :) helps me learn more plus keeps me distracted from all the other stuff going on in my life.
[17:30:19] <rach23py> Question:How do I make this happen: on pageload, somehow let javascript to call a API, pull the data out and save it in json, then use the information in json to create url links in this dynamic page.
[17:30:28] <jeffreylevesque> i'm adding travis to my repo
[17:30:37] <robertmaxrees> rach23py just run the code.
[17:30:41] <jeffreylevesque> i'd like to validate python and javascript code
[17:30:50] <robertmaxrees> like... nothing special about what you're doing.
[17:30:51] <jeffreylevesque> but it seems js code is nodejs validation?
[17:30:58] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque huh?
[17:31:06] <robertmaxrees> "js code is nodejs validation"?
[17:31:55] <rach23py> robertmaxrees: just run the code? that is it?
[17:32:20] <robertmaxrees> rach23py not sure what you're lost on.  you might need to put part of that into a document ready.
[17:32:22] <robertmaxrees> but it's pretty basic.
[17:32:56] <Sal> robertmaxrees, isaw that you's in #css too... do i need to go there to ask some css help?
[17:33:01] <Sal> or can you answer here?
[17:33:06] <rach23py> l only learned js yesterday and today, even basic is beyond me. :o
[17:33:17] <robertmaxrees> Sal i rarely pay attention in there - keep your questions on topic, either way :)
[17:33:27] <robertmaxrees> ask the channel there.  if I have an answer, i'll answer.
[17:33:37] <jeffreylevesque> i'm wondering if the following is correct travis config to validate js
[17:33:39] <jeffreylevesque> https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/bbb3e22e7110afeb4cb596f7118503885d061ea2/.travis.yml
[17:33:52] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque this isn't really a travis channel :/
[17:34:42] <robertmaxrees> jeffreylevesque there's #travis though, which looks like it's for that project
[17:41:49] <gambl0re> robertmatrix is exclusive to #jquery only..
[18:10:41] <mentoc> I am using formData.append('file',$("input[type=file]")[0].files[0]); and after that I console.log formData but it shows nothing in the console.log all it says is "FormData{  }"
[18:19:30] <mentoc> http://pastebin.com/xqykinrj
[18:19:44] <mentoc> Is there anything wrong with my post() func?
[18:40:53] <Asaterics> hello
[18:41:12] <Asaterics> someone how can Iget the click event on jtable jquery pagination?
[19:01:11] <JackFruh> Anyone here?
[20:06:17] <rochadt> Lots of people :)
[20:34:50] <alexut> i have a question about .offset().top  it seems that it's not reading my .class position corectly and i don't understand why -_- ...  http://www.caspianservices.net/draft-test-page/ i have both scroll and position top logged.
[20:48:40] <alexut> hmm, maybe it's reading the offset value to fast and i should put the code in the bottom :/
[21:05:55] <Lexus> http://jsfiddle.net/xc4u75p0/
[21:06:03] <Lexus> how can I to store the second line in a var?
[21:20:37] <acidjazz> what ya mean lexus
[21:26:22] <alexut> trying to figure out why my offset.top is different from the window.scrollY   reading by @1000px. can anyone help me with this? http://www.caspianservices.net/draft-test-page/  here is the page I have troubles with.
[21:29:08] <acidjazz> those are two different values i think alexut
[21:30:19] <alexut> i know they are different, but when i scroll to the element, shouldn't the value of scroll y be comparable to the value of the element offset?
[21:30:28] <alexut> @acidjazz:
[21:31:51] <acidjazz> scrollY is the number of pixels the docuemnt has been scrolled vertically
[21:32:00] <acidjazz> offset is your elements offset to the top of the document
[21:32:15] <acidjazz> relative to the document
[21:34:42] <alexut> oh, acidjazz so when element scrolls in to view  it's at the bottom of the page - but scrollY is at the top and I should just add the window height?
[21:35:07] <acidjazz> what value do you want?
[21:36:46] <alexut> i just want to execute a function when element scrolls in to view
[21:39:02] <acidjazz> ok so you wanna knwo when the element is above the viewport
[21:39:47] <acidjazz> so you wanna compare $(window).scrollTop() to $(yourelement).offset().top
[21:40:07] <acidjazz> so do this to your code
[21:40:10] <acidjazz> console.log both of those values
[21:40:13] <acidjazz> scroll
[21:40:14] <acidjazz> and watch the numbers
[21:40:18] <acidjazz> youll understand
[22:13:21] <DarkSector> https://jsfiddle.net/cp8ogqv8/ Why is the method returning false. The number 2 is in the list
[22:13:31] <DarkSector> can anyone tell me what I am doing wrogn?
[22:13:37] <DarkSector> Does each() require a break?
[22:16:57] <DarkSector> Anyone around?
[22:17:40] <DarkSector> Holy shit return true doesn't actually return
[22:17:42] <DarkSector> what the fuck
[22:17:45] <Uhkis> DarkSector: you're returning true from the each()'s function, then returning false on the parent of each's function
[22:19:31] <DarkSector> yeah, I just figured it out
[22:19:45] <DarkSector> I didn't realize each wasn't broken on return
[22:19:50] <DarkSector> I fixed it. Thanks Uhkis
[22:20:12] <Uhkis> DarkSector: also..
[22:20:24] <DarkSector> ?
[22:20:57] <DarkSector> Uhkis, ?
[22:21:59] <Uhkis> https://jsfiddle.net/cp8ogqv8/5/ a bit cleaner
[22:23:34] <DarkSector> uh, isn't it redeclaring the var p everytime?
[22:23:41] <DarkSector> oh wait
[22:23:43] <DarkSector> that doesn't matter
[22:23:44] <Uhkis> DarkSector: what is that code supposed to do
[22:23:54] <DarkSector> just check if the next page number is in the list
[22:24:00] <DarkSector> the next page number is 2
[22:24:14] <DarkSector> and the list is, well, #paginationlist
[22:24:49] <Uhkis> so, 1 & 2 should return true and 3 not?
[22:25:04] <DarkSector> only 2 should return true
[22:25:07] <DarkSector> else false
[22:25:18] <DarkSector> Which it seems to be doing
[22:49:26] <halvors> Any ides why $(this).closest('form').trigger('submit'); isn't sibmitting my form?
[22:57:08] <jaccob> I did $set $PATH=... then logout login and my path is same as before
[22:57:59] <jaccob> those paths I deleted I didn't include are still there and those I added are not. It must be in a config file, but it isn't ~/.profile or ~/.bashrc or in /etc/
[22:59:15] <jaccob> sorry wrong channel
