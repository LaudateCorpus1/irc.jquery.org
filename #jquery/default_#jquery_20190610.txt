[04:30:22] <kanha> Hi, I am new to jquery. I am making an UI where, when a user selects a pice of text then a label should be associated with that text. So, if the text is "JQuery is awesome." Then when user selects `Jquery` then The text on the webpage should get updated as "Jquery <Label> is awesome". I was looking at the `select` method but am not sure how to do this. I tried and example here: https://jsfiddle.net/4xjwue06/
[04:32:09] <kanha> Not, sure how to do this. Few questions (1) how to get the selected text by a user. (2) In my example .select() only works in textarea, how to make it work for text in  paragraph <p> ?
[07:02:50] <Cork> kanha: have a look at learn.jquery.com you want .on('change', function() {})
[07:05:04] <forgotmynick> hello. I have a list of product sizes and trying to replace text in <a></a> tag where any size with a number in a bracket is removed so e.g. "XL (45)" becomes "XL". Some sizes have brackets but no numbers so I only want to remove the ones with numbers. Can someone give me an example of how to do this please?
[07:05:34] <Cork> forgotmynick: add a <span> in the link tag and update that instead
[07:05:53] <Cork> it is better for stability to use an element for updates instead of regex matching content
[07:06:44] <forgotmynick> I can’t modify the code as it’s managed by a third party that regularly release updates
[07:07:16] <Cork> then you most likely can't do much, as if you change the content it will just replace it
[07:34:53] <forgotmynick> I only need to change the text once the page loads for the customer that's all
[07:38:47] <kanha> Cork, thanks a lot for the reference :)
[07:39:10] <Cork> forgotmynick: well you will have to grab the content of the link and then regex match it in js
[07:39:15] <Cork> as css can't help you
[07:39:43] <Cork> kanha: np
[07:55:32] <MikeD_> Do you know if it's possible to make a 2 series sparkline?
[07:56:19] <Cork> are you sure you're asking in the correct channel?
[07:56:55] <MikeD_> what other channel would know more about jquery sparkline plugin?
[07:57:16] <Cork> should prob mention that then
[07:57:35] <MikeD_> though if you're suggesting that using a jquery plugin where there are newer graphic libraries, that's probably a better question to ask :)
[07:58:22] <Cork> i'm suggesting just asking how to make a setting in an unmentioned plugin, and expecting ppl to know what plugin that setting belongs to
[07:58:30] <Cork> isn't very helpful
[07:59:23] <MikeD_> i agree, i forgot that sparkline isn't as common outside this tiny dev group as it is inside it:  https://omnipotent.net/jquery.sparkline/#s-about
[08:04:11] <shoky> MikeD_: that "Composite inline" example seems relevant ?
[08:04:52] <shoky> and 'composite' option
[08:05:43] <MikeD_> yeah, now that i'm looking at docs... but it's still nice to ask people who might have already learned where the ugly bits are
[08:07:06] <shoky> not if you haven't read the docs yourself
[08:08:09] <MikeD_> i have implemented the 'normal' usage of 'draw a trendline' - but it was years ago
[08:09:01] <shoky> well, it hasn't been updated in 6 years :p
[10:41:17] <inna> hi
[10:41:34] <inna> what is the state of the -ui and -mobile versions?
[10:41:57] <inna> are they still quasi orphaned projects?
[10:42:12] <inna> or neglegted, at least.
[10:52:36] <Cork> inna: uis bug tracker haven't had any activity in over two years. i would say it is quite dead
[10:52:49] <Cork> inna: mobile i haven't ever found the point of so can't say
[10:53:11] <inna> of mobile?
[10:53:52] <inna> how can you not see the point in mobile
[10:53:59] <inna> what's the alternative?
[10:54:25] <taplar> bootstrap grid is a common approach
[10:54:42] <inna> grids are so 2010
[10:54:42] <taplar> vue/react with their own mobile first styling approaches are a thing too
[10:54:49] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[10:54:59] <robertmaxrees> grids are more modern than jquery mobile fwiw
[10:55:17] <inna> you cannot compare one to the other.
[10:55:31] <inna> mobile is not just a fuckin css framework.
[10:55:37] <taplar> it's not that difficult to roll your own responsive css styling framework
[10:56:05] <taplar> and calm down dude
[10:56:15] <inna> lol okay i'm not mad tho
[10:56:43] <robertmaxrees> either way, jquery ui and jquery mobile were both supposed to undergo major rewrites to better fit their respective roles.
[10:56:52] <inna> i know
[10:57:08] <inna> but that's news from like... 2014?
[10:57:17] <inna> 2012?
[10:57:22] <Cork> 2016 i think
[10:57:27] <robertmaxrees> yep.  in the intervening years, a lot's changed with the foundation.
[10:57:28] <inna> mmmkay
[10:57:36] <robertmaxrees> and with CSS, JS, etc.
[10:57:46] <taplar> frameworks the make use of shadow doms make a lot more sense, vs jquery ui these days
[10:57:52] <taplar> especially for mobile
[10:58:04] <inna> you mean because jquery classic became literally useless?
[10:58:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:58:14] <Cork> taplar: well as long as you can go bleading edge browsers only
[10:58:16] <taplar> because there are performance gains from touching the dom less
[10:58:23] <robertmaxrees> "jquery classic" isn't "literally useles" :)
[10:58:28] <taplar> Cork sure
[10:58:49] <inna> Cork: one can go bleeding edge these days
[10:59:08] <taplar> not all companies are ok with going just the edge
[10:59:18] <Cork> inna: eh... not if you depend on browser features and not all visitors has it
[10:59:21] <robertmaxrees> not all users are able to update to the latest and greatest.
[10:59:28] <inna> Cork: we now have automatic updating of applications without requiring user interaction. we can expect people to have bleeding edge browsers.
[10:59:29] <Cork> heck many still support ie7
[10:59:44] <taplar> are you in an intranet situation inna?
[10:59:53] <inna> Cork: if a visitor doesn't support shit, he isn't compatible to the site.
[11:00:03] <robertmaxrees> inna that's a really strange stance to take.
[11:00:12] <Cork> inna: that depends A LOT on if the visitor actually make you money
[11:00:17] <taplar> ^^^^^
[11:00:18] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^
[11:00:58] <inna> you     are     disgusting.
[11:01:04] <taplar> and calm down dude
[11:01:13] <inna> lol j/k i'm just joking
[11:01:22] <Cork> for a random web blog or similar, sure for a business site, no way
[11:01:27] <robertmaxrees> heh hard to tell when you keep doing that.
[11:01:38] <inna> robertmaxrees: yeah but
[11:01:49] <inna> robertmaxrees: why you so serious anyway?
[11:02:00] <Cork> <_<'
[11:02:04] <inna> ARE WE BEING SERIOUS?
[11:02:10] <inna> like what the fuck man.
[11:02:11] <taplar> you want us to joke about recommending developmental practices?
[11:02:19] <Cork> your asking question in a support channel...
[11:02:28] <inna> nah i just want you to be as relaxes as me.
[11:02:40] <inna> yeah never mind no more words will come over my lips.
[11:02:48] <inna> not a single one.
[11:02:56] <taplar> keep in mind, we all have jobs, we may be at -right now-.  we're taking time to offer suggestions.  not joke around
[11:03:09] <inna> okay
[11:03:14] <robertmaxrees> ^ a joke is fine, but there's a point where it's just trolling.
[11:03:15] <inna> i now being serious again.
[11:04:44] <inna> well
[11:04:47] <inna> to be serious
[11:04:57] <inna> i'm a pro and here's my tip: IE8+
[11:05:15] * Cork /ignore inna
[11:05:16] <inna> not IE8, IE8+
[11:05:18] <inna> lol
[11:05:31] <taplar> what do you mean by that?
[11:05:42] <inna> idk
[11:06:05] <inna> i imagined an imaginary scrollback containing a discussion fitting my message
[11:06:36] <taplar> IE8 would not be considered bleeding edge.
[11:06:41] <inna> sorry i believe my behavior might be inappropriate even though it isn't intended to be as such in any way.
[11:06:51] <taplar> IE11 wouldn't even be bleeding edge.
[11:06:55] <robertmaxrees> inna just drop it and move on, okay?
[11:07:09] <inna> oh there's two bleeding edges? i always bleeding edge being the edge on the right side.
[11:07:23] <inna> robertmaxrees: drop what?
[11:07:53] <robertmaxrees> you're walking a fine line trolling the channel.  it's getting old.
[11:08:03] <inna> man
[11:08:07] <inna> i dropped it
[11:08:11] <inna> and indicated it by
[11:08:21] <inna> acting as though i wouldn't know anything about it
[11:08:36] <inna> okay.
[11:12:46] <taplar> nice start to the week
[11:13:25] <robertmaxrees> srs
