[00:00:58] <JJJAJSON> http://jsfiddle.net/SR7d9/4/ ive done it and it works for the bottom div, but the top one seems to be 'under' the box shadow - so you can still see it - i can position the top div as absolute then do a z-index right? but then that usually gives me problems when i use absolute position, is there a way to make this div appear on top of the box shadow
[00:00:58] <JJJAJSON> ?
[00:05:39] <JJJAJSON> nevermind, what i did was set a margin with a negative margin to hide the top one :D
[00:09:56] <JJJAJSON> oh damn it doesnt work if the colour is lighter lol
[00:49:43] <diverdude> how do i create a split panel which i can drag?
[01:05:13] <PatBateman> hi, why I cant change a div's background color with jquery, after I set first with css?
[01:05:58] <Macaveli> Why is this alert not showing? Clearly the field is empty http://jsfiddle.net/dVZaT/
[01:09:55] <paulvd> i want to make a vertical carousel, which would have 3 text, all three visible just the inactive ones with different color, any suggestions which one should i try ? i am trying to use cycle2 but it just doesnt initialise
[01:16:58] <diverdude> How can i using jquery implement drag left-right in this example? http://jsfiddle.net/2fzxF/
[01:19:55] <paulvd> see cycle2 not working http://jsfiddle.net/s6MHp/
[01:22:30] <paulvd> is there really 767 people here
[01:26:33] <paulvd> jquery roundabout plugin, can we make it vertical ?
[01:45:12] <mxO_> HEllo, all of my code falls inside of $(function () {
[01:45:27] <mxO_> And I was wondering is there any way to call a function from outside?
[01:45:45] <mxO_> I have this function foo that is inside, and outside I have function bar(){foo()}
[01:49:51] <brandonshowers> PatBateman: Heyo. Did you figure that backbround color thing out? Any chance you can show some code?
[01:51:58] <paulvd> why's the cycle2 slider not initialising here ? http://jsfiddle.net/s6MHp/1/
[02:02:25] <erming> paulvd: http://jsfiddle.net/s6MHp/5/
[02:02:35] <brandonshowers> Macaveli: For 2 reasons. 1) The .val() method is specific to form elements. 2) your $().each(function(){}) method requires a jquery object so it's not actually looping through anything. If you wanted to loop through an array you'd use $.each() instead. See this example http://jsfiddle.net/dVZaT/3/
[02:02:37] <erming> moved the script to the HTML-textarea instead
[02:08:08] <walruslt> Good morning everyone! I have question,
[02:10:24] <brandonshowers> walruslt: I might be able to help you. What's up?
[02:10:48] <walruslt> I have code in my website witch should retun div#id after select option has been selected
[02:11:28] <walruslt> but when i alert($(this).parent().attr("class")); i repeats it self 3 or 4 times.
[02:11:58] <walruslt> when i try it on jsfiddle it alert's me only one time
[02:12:03] <walruslt> http://jsfiddle.net/HWD4V/
[02:12:50] <walruslt> Any ideas? Or anyone could help and tell what problem it could be?
[02:14:02] <brandonshowers> Your example looks good to me. May I see the code as it is on your website?
[02:15:04] <walruslt> Sorry, i forgot to refresh page after i edited page, no problem
[02:15:10] <walruslt> sorry. Have a nice time! :)
[02:15:28] <brandonshowers> :) No worries. You too.
[02:16:02] <walruslt> See you, cheers! ;)
[02:16:24] <paulvd> ermin thanksss
[02:22:23] <walruslt> Any one here ?
[02:28:43] <erming> walruslt: im pretty sure in your code, you call ".delegate()" multiple times
[02:29:05] <erming> walruslt: you could add "return false", like this: http://jsfiddle.net/HWD4V/1/
[02:29:11] <erming> that will cancel any additional events from triggering
[02:29:27] <reuf> how can i target specific property of certain element for example body has background-image i want to apply new css only to this image ?
[02:30:08] <erming> reuf: you want to CSS target any element with a specific background-image?
[02:30:22] <walruslt> Why could it be that, when i load ajax html content from "another page" with form wich loads json and creates inputs and then i load the same form by pressing (Refresh) wich loads "another page" in same way but .empty it before - it creates same inputs twice and then pop-ups 2 alert boxes when i select an option
[02:30:28] <reuf> specific element;s background-image
[02:31:03] <erming> you can get the css attribute like this: .css("background-image")
[02:31:23] <erming> i guess you could iterate your elements and check for background-image
[02:32:16] <erming> $(".item").each(function() { if ($(this).css("background-image") != "") { ... }});
[02:33:11] <erming> i tried it.. if an element doesn't have a background-image, $(this).css("background-image") will return "none"
[02:33:28] <walruslt> Should'nt it destroy json-jquery-generated inputs when i re-load (refresh) form and create new one's instead of duplicating them?
[02:34:05] <erming>  walruslt: you're using .delegate(".. selector ..", "event", function() {});
[02:34:13] <erming> you only have to call it once
[02:34:34] <erming> even if these elements are created _after_ you call .delegate()
[02:34:57] <erming> element.on("click", function() {}); however, gets destroyed if element is removed/overwritten
[02:35:09] <walruslt> cheers, i will try it out
[02:35:19] <erming> vs parent.delegate(".child", "click", function() {});
[02:35:35] <erming> the last example only gets destroyed when _parent_ is removed
[02:35:54] <erming> good luck
[02:36:29] <walruslt> cheers!
[02:36:31] <walruslt> :)
[02:36:34] <AndyFTP__> hey
[02:47:59] <haithere> hello there guys I am updating from Jquery v 1.7 to 1.11 and http://jsfiddle.net/9nM7a/ gets an uncaught type error, any thoughts ?
[02:49:30] <walruslt> how to could i chop string from end to $x, or from $x to $z in php?
[02:50:14] <Jattenalle> walruslt, http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.substr.php bookmark php.net, make your life easier.
[02:50:53] <sacho> haithere, live has been removed from newer versions of jquery, see .on
[02:51:12] <haithere> ah ok thx for that, so .on is the new live?
[02:52:23] <walruslt> what function would be for echo chop('aaazzz', 2, 5 ) would print aazz
[02:53:08] <haithere> sacho: thanks a lot that helped me + kudos
[02:54:23] <Jattenalle> walruslt, i just linked you, stop asking.
[03:01:13] <walruslt> ok, sorry. found it :)
[03:05:47] <Henwa_> Is there any special case with string.replace when dealing with commas? http://jsfiddle.net/4d9hD/ console.log(cost); is returning NaN in that snippet
[03:08:08] <lionmac> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[03:08:12] <lionmac> how to fix this error
[03:08:25] <shoky> Henwa_: no, there is a special case with <input type="number"> not allowing commas (at least in your locale)
[03:08:36] <Henwa_> without a code sample it's impossible to give you an answer lionmac
[03:08:58] <Henwa_> ... that makes sense. Sorry for the stupid question shoky, and thanks
[03:10:29] <lionmac> theres a strange conflic between a custom js code and the jquery min
[03:10:41] <lionmac> when i remove the custom code the slider works
[03:57:56] <alistair> I have this line in my code... $("li").hide();  The page loads and the li elements remain displayed. I can't figure out why. Any tips on debugging?
[03:59:32] <hartvig> If you want to hide it on load, why not use CSS?
[04:01:35] <alistair> guess so, yeah, I'll try that, hope .show() works!
[04:05:11] <walruslt> anyone knows some kind of "special" browser for website development production, but would be only for that kind of purpouse and be very light weight and fast?
[04:10:47] <d0de> in js, what do double curly brackets {{}} signify please?
[04:11:31] <d0de> like, onload="startTimer('{{ timer }}');"
[04:12:01] <brunoais> d0de, why a string?
[04:12:38] <brunoais> d0de, that sounds like to be something meant for a templating engine of some sort to replace that with a specific value
[04:12:39] <d0de> brunoais, I don't know, it's not my code, it's from https://xss-game.appspot.com/level4
[04:13:07] <brunoais> hum...
[04:13:18] <brunoais> "onload="
[04:13:23] <brunoais> Is that in the <body>?
[04:13:47] <d0de> yeah
[04:14:14] <d0de> <input id="timer" name="timer" value="3"> is passed as a GET form action
[04:14:27] <d0de> I guess it somehow becomes {{ timer }} but I don't see where
[04:14:51] <d0de> I just hadn't seen the double brackets before and wondered about them
[04:15:33] <Taylor_Karras> anybody here?
[04:34:57] <acidjazz> i almost think this snapchat stuff is staged to display the meaning of the product
[05:05:18] <damasceno> Hello, I'm having a problem with Jquery listview. It doesn't show the arrow (On the right corner) and the name is also centralized and it should be on the left side. I have no idea why this is happening since I tested in jsfiddle and it works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/aLn6a/
[05:10:09] <acidjazz> i have a for loop 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and i need to produce the pattern 28, 24, 20, 16.. whats the math to do that?
[05:12:17] <d0de> for ( i = 28; i >=0; i = i - 4 ) ?
[05:13:34] <decx> for (i=0; i<5;i++){ console.log(28-(i*4)) }
[05:16:57] <acidjazz> ty decx thats it
[05:16:57] <MikeD_> acidjazz: does the "..." actually limit the value, or will it go to negative results?
[05:17:10] <acidjazz> 28-i*4
[05:17:28] <acidjazz> MikeD_: it wont go that far blue neg values are fine
[05:27:24] <davesleep> how do i grab the first parent with class 'myclass'
[05:28:22] <beancurd> closest(".myclass")
[05:31:45] <Starcraftmazter> hi
[05:31:54] <Starcraftmazter> can anyone suggest scrollbar prettifying plugins?
[05:32:04] <Starcraftmazter> im using nanoscroller, but having too muc htrouble trying to get it working properly
[05:35:28] <decx> https://github.com/jnicol/trackpad-scroll-emulator
[05:49:34] <uskerine> does anyone know how to uncheck via JQuery an input type="checkbox" in bootstrap?
[05:54:08] <davesleep> thanks beancurd
[05:54:56] <beancurd> wut.
[05:55:02] <Starcraftmazter> decx: thank you, seems to be a solid plugin
[05:55:21] <beancurd> i am confused.
[05:57:36] <d0de> I'm trying to bind something to when a user clicks on an anchor link, but the bind triggers before the URL updates with the anchor
[05:57:57] <d0de> and the thing I'm binding needs the anchor in the URL to work
[06:02:10] <shoky> d0de: mm after the url updates, you're on a new document already. doesn't make sense to bind after it updates
[06:04:18] <d0de> but it's just the #string at the end, that doesn't count as a new doc does it?
[06:05:03] <d0de> like myapp.com/#user-query
[06:05:26] <shoky> ah. yeah
[06:05:41] <decx> $(this).prop('hre ).split('#')[1]
[06:05:45] <shoky> ^
[06:05:53] <decx> href'
[06:06:15] <shoky> $(this).prop('href') === this.href   btw
[06:06:25] <decx> oh right
[06:06:45] <decx> $(this)[0] ^^
[06:07:13] <BillCriswell> Would this.hash work as well?
[06:07:37] <shoky> any hash works for me
[06:07:40] <BillCriswell> Haha
[06:08:07] <decx> hm right has is a prop
[06:08:11] <decx> hash
[06:08:27] <decx> even easier
[06:08:40] <BillCriswell> That does give you the # though.
[06:09:23] <decx> i'm already pissed
[06:09:32] <BillCriswell> I don't even blame you dude.
[06:09:33] <shoky> BillCriswell you shouldn't have posted that github/django link yesterday. any faith i had left in humanity is in obliterated
[06:09:40] <decx> today is national holiday and it's the prime holiday for drinkers
[06:09:40] <shoky> -in
[06:09:46] <decx> hte whole day is about drinking
[06:09:48] <BillCriswell> shoky: Haha dude I couldn't believe it.
[06:09:53] <BillCriswell> decx: Niiice.
[06:10:11] <shoky> seriously, it depressed me :(
[06:10:58] <decx> people ride around on bikes with crates of beer in little bike trailers
[06:11:11] <BillCriswell> decx: Sounds like my dream land.
[06:11:33] <decx> i went to the morning drinking with friends but had enough at 12
[06:11:38] <decx> -.-
[06:13:02] <BillCriswell> decx: https://github.com/django/django/pull/2692 did you read that?
[06:13:02] <Sergonium> 12 crates?
[06:13:22] <BillCriswell> Look away shoky!
[06:13:25] <shoky> nooooooooo
[06:13:52] <decx> that's ridiculous. love it
[06:14:25] <decx> good lord thats a long thread
[06:14:32] <decx> i'll read war&peace instead
[06:14:46] <BillCriswell> My favorite comment was "Is it at all ironic that this got merged into master?"
[06:14:56] <shoky> ;]
[06:17:11] <puchacz> hi, can I profile my (single) webpage in chrome console or similar?
[06:17:36] <puchacz> I suspect which function takes long, and I'd like to catch it redhanded
[06:17:57] * shoky chuckles
[06:19:35] <puchacz> ok, found it
[06:19:38] <BillCriswell> puchacz: I don't do this often (really, ever) but woudl the "Profile" tab in Chrome help?
[06:19:56] <puchacz> BillCriswell: just noticed it :-)
[06:19:56] <BillCriswell> Ok awesome.
[06:20:00] <BillCriswell> Haha nice.
[06:22:41] <BillCriswell> puchacz: Did you catch the culprit?
[06:22:59] <puchacz> BillCriswell: I am looking, because it is not where I suspected it was
[06:23:24] <BillCriswell> The plot thickens.
[06:24:31] <puchacz> will check again with non-minified jquery
[06:24:40] <puchacz> I suspect now it is offset().top!
[06:25:05] <puchacz> I call it about 100 times, but - it is only offset().top
[06:26:37] <BillCriswell> Is it a situation where you could cache it?
[06:28:33] <uskerine> does anyone know how to uncheck via JQuery an input type="checkbox" in bootstrap? regular JQuery code for checkboxes does not work. Thanks!
[06:29:08] <puchacz> BillCriswell: got it
[06:29:13] <puchacz> it boils down to this: elem.getBoundingClientRect();
[06:29:18] <puchacz> in jquery itself
[06:29:58] <puchacz> as I am only interested in vertical offset, can I get it another way?
[06:31:05] <BillCriswell> puchacz: Not that I'm aware of.
[06:31:23] <BillCriswell> puchacz: Can you cache the offset().top or is it for different elements?
[06:31:40] <puchacz> BillCriswell: different elements
[06:34:45] <BillCriswell> puchacz: Yeah not sure then.
[06:35:11] <puchacz> BillCriswell: no worries. maybe not worth optimising - I will get into cross browser incompatibilities
[06:35:28] <BillCriswell> Yeah.
[06:35:36] <albipri> Hi! I'm using ckeditor inside jQuery UI sortable item, but when I complete the dragging event, on drop of the item, ckeditor lost data and freeze. Has anyone had the same issue and can suggest me a workaround?
[06:36:29] <decx> ckeditor INSIDE a sortable?
[06:39:11] <BillCriswell> Nothing makes me more sad than a WYSIWYG.
[06:40:30] <BillCriswell> A live preview of some markdown is how I'd like all my user entered text.
[06:40:43] <puchacz> oh, my.... http://www.yiotabytes.com/2011/04/when-does-dom-access-slow-down.html
[06:40:56] <puchacz> it says that simply asking for those properties causes browser to redraw
[06:42:03] <puchacz> but it was 3 years ago
[06:43:33] <BillCriswell> puchacz: If that's a huge deal for you can you think of another way around it?
[06:43:45] <puchacz> I am thinking :-)
[06:46:10] <Guest52231> is there a known reason why jquery addClass would not work in IE?
[06:46:28] <BillCriswell> Guest52231: Nothing that jumps out at me.
[06:47:05] <TheEternalAbyss> well then I'm stumped
[06:47:40] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Set up a simple demo on jsbin, if it works there then it's something else in your code.
[06:48:01] <TheEternalAbyss> it works in jsfiddle and on my page in ff and chrome
[06:48:26] <md1985> Has anyone ever tried filtering google maps markers by buttons on a page?
[06:48:39] <BillCriswell> It works in jsfiddle in IE?
[06:48:54] <TheEternalAbyss> jsfiddle won't even load in my IE 10
[06:48:59] <BillCriswell> lol
[06:49:02] <BillCriswell> What about bin?
[06:49:13] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/paqakaci/1/edit
[06:49:40] <albipri> decx: Yes I’ve blocks of elements with inside the editor ckeditor
[06:49:40] <TheEternalAbyss> let me try that
[06:50:54] <md1985> Anyone?
[06:51:05] <beancurd> md1985: yep.
[06:51:53] <d0de> this is the toy project I've been working on in case anyone is curious http://vidyabuzz.com thanks everyone for all the help
[06:51:59] <TheEternalAbyss> http://jsbin.com/xegudego/1/
[06:52:30] <TheEternalAbyss> see... no class added
[06:52:38] <md1985> beancurd: how was it done? Outside the main loop for markers?
[06:52:39] <beancurd> md1985: look at this example, http://www.geocodezip.com/v3_MW_example_categories.html the checkboxes at the bottom. it's easy to modify it to use buttons instead.
[06:53:07] <TheEternalAbyss> well wait... i need to add jquery..
[06:53:18] <beancurd> TheEternalAbyss: that would help.
[06:53:23] <TheEternalAbyss> lol
[06:53:44] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: The class is added.
[06:53:44] <TheEternalAbyss> ok.. yea it works in ie
[06:53:47] <beancurd> md1985: another example here http://www.geocodezip.com/v3_MW_example_categories.html
[06:53:48] <BillCriswell> Brb.
[06:54:16] <TheEternalAbyss> why the heck is it not working on my page... it works in ff and chrome..
[06:54:19] <md1985> beancurd: ha ha thats the same
[06:58:02] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: Anything in the console?
[06:59:48] <albipri> Anyone?
[07:01:22] <NoiseEee> albipri: you should probably follow up with ckeditor forums etf
[07:01:24] <NoiseEee> etc
[07:03:05] <deep_crash_55> Is it possible to combine wildcard/nth child selectors? This doesn't work, but works when I use it in CSS:
[07:03:05] <deep_crash_55> div[class^=street_address]:nth-child(2)
[07:04:00] <NoiseEee> deep_crash_55: don't know, but if it works in css i'd try it with querySelectorAll
[07:04:32] <deep_crash_55> NoiseEee: Ok, thanks
[07:17:03] <md1985> hey beancurd are you still around?
[07:18:03] <deep_crash_55> NoiseEee: Turns out it was my own fault... the element I'm matching has two classes, and the selector acts like it's a single string, so I needed to use the *= wildcard instead
[07:20:04] <NoiseEee> sweet deep_crash_55 thx
[07:27:52] <santoz23422> Hey Guys…i need help by the jquery mobile download builder
[07:28:21] <santoz23422> i just want to download the jquery mobile engine without ANY styling :-/ but i dont know, which options to pic
[07:28:55] <BillCriswell> santoz23422: Just don't use the CSS?
[07:29:22] <santoz23422> okay that sounds helpful… my main problem is to combine to jsfiddles...
[07:29:30] <BillCriswell> You're going to be in for a world of hurting doing that I think, but if it's really what you want.
[07:29:49] <santoz23422> maybe it is not…but i’m not so good @html :-/
[07:30:03] <santoz23422> i would like to write a mobile application with cordova

[07:32:09] <Nach0z> santoz23422: if you're looking in chrome, chrome makes <BR /> tags have a 1px width or something

[07:34:23] <santoz23422> i have a i have a header composed of 3 pictures with a 15px border top (black) for the statusbar. Then comes the content, which should be smooth-scrollable and then the fixed footer composed of 3 images.

[07:39:09] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsfiddle.net/NV6Py/322/
[07:39:24] <puchacz> decx: it is, but you can fiddle with css and it is not a block element anymore
[07:39:37] <antlong> is anyone interested in helping out with an open source sci-fi game? js/css/html. we began a week ago, about 15 of us (most are extremely part time). need more dev help. repo is here: https://github.com/anthonyappcard/multiverseminer
[07:39:42] <decx> well check if it's a block element then
[07:39:46] <santoz23422> BillCriswell: yeah, but do u see the 1px moving while you swipe the articles?
[07:39:59] <puchacz> decx: yes, probably it is sufficient
[07:40:07] <BillCriswell> santoz23422: Not in the demo I just sent you
[07:40:20] <santoz23422> …what browser do u use?
[07:40:31] <BillCriswell> Chrome.
[07:40:40] <santoz23422> hmm…just a second, i’m usin ff...wait
[07:41:14] <decx> swipeevents look cool is there a separate helperplugin like that
[07:41:33] <decx> jquery.event.swipe?
[07:41:45] <BillCriswell> decx: Hammer could work.
[07:41:53] <decx> oh right
[07:41:59] <decx> i even use that
[07:42:21] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[07:42:45] <decx> thats what you get for being canned at 12 and then afterburned at 2
[07:42:48] <santoz23422> BillCriswell: if you just click in the content from „article 1“ you see the footer gettin bigger and smaller click by click 1px=
[07:42:49] <santoz23422> ?
[07:42:51] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[07:43:14] <decx> http://i.imgur.com/5Hn05lc.jpg this is me atm
[07:43:27] <BillCriswell> You're beans?
[07:43:37] <decx> get it
[07:43:45] <decx> canned and baked
[07:43:49] <decx> hitlerious
[07:44:21] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[07:44:35] <BillCriswell> I got a nice buzz last night.
[07:44:50] <deep_crash_55> I don't get it
[07:45:02] <BillCriswell> deep_crash_55: It's a can of bakes beans.
[07:45:28] <deep_crash_55> Yes, I understood that much
[07:45:44] <BillCriswell> I thought that was all of it.
[07:45:49] <BillCriswell> I could very well be missing something as well.
[07:46:11] <decx> there is no hidden meaning, iu lost all ability to be subtle
[07:47:48] <RLa> is there a shortcut to return a promise that resolves to the given value?
[07:47:51] <BillCriswell> deep_crash_55: Did you figure out your issue?
[07:48:12] <joker666> hey, is winodow on load and document.ready even same?
[07:48:19] <joker666> *event
[07:48:31] <deep_crash_55> BillCriswell: Yes, the element I'm matching has two classes, and the selector acts like it's a single string, so I needed to use the *= wildcard instead of ^=
[07:48:41] <BillCriswell> joker666: window on load would wait for images, document ready won't.
[07:49:19] <BillCriswell> deep_crash_55: Not sure I'm following there. .class1.class2 ?
[07:49:46] <decx> man, i never realized how complicated dom ready wthiout jquery is
[07:50:11] <deep_crash_55> My element was similar to <div class="red box"> (with a space between class names), and I was trying to match on ^=box (class starts with box)
[07:50:18] <joker666> ok thanks :) now how do i do this :::              if($('#my-awesome-dropzone').hasClass('dz-started')){console.log('file added');}
[07:50:18] <BillCriswell> I tried doing some DOM stuff without jQuery the other night and got it to work, but wasn't happy with the code.
[07:50:50] <decx> im just looking at the fiddle wrapper for it
[07:51:10] <BillCriswell> deep_crash_55: Just .box would work there though, unless you wanted like class="red box-something-else"
[07:51:19] <decx> http://paste2.org/KC1JyAkD
[07:51:34] <deep_crash_55> BillCriswell: Yes, that's why I used the wildcard, it was more like your example
[07:51:42] <BillCriswell> Ah ok.
[07:56:00] <joker666> BillCriswell how do i call an if statement to fire?
[07:56:34] <BillCriswell> joker666: Not sure I'm following you.
[07:56:59] <decx> if (statement){ fire() }
[07:57:32] <joker666> like? if the same event occurs multiple times i want the block inside if statement to fire once
[07:57:57] <joker666> once and you are done, no matter how many times that same event occurs
[07:58:05] <decx> .one()
[07:58:15] <joker666> i don't get you decx
[07:58:20] <decx> dito
[07:58:27] <BillCriswell> No one does really.
[07:58:58] <BillCriswell> joker666: He's saying do $('.el').one('click', function () { console.log('I only work once'); });
[07:59:33] <joker666> wow, there's 'one' function, i was thinking about makingmy own
[07:59:38] <decx> no i just started with the lyrics to a three dog night song
[07:59:39] <joker666> i feel emo
[08:01:14] <BillCriswell> I was thinking about calling out today and I should have.
[08:01:38] <joker666> anyone using xChat here?
[08:02:50] <okdamn> how do i check when url hashbang change?
[08:03:14] <decx> window.onhashchange
[08:03:22] <okdamn> site.com/#!asd -> site.com/#!page2 -> how do i get the hashbang changed?
[08:03:37] <okdamn> decx:  is that full browser supported?
[08:03:49] <decx> ie8 i believe
[08:03:55] <decx> ya
[08:04:52] <okdamn> any other way? :P
[08:05:05] <okdamn> i mean no jquery hashbang checker?
[08:05:47] <Bloomberg> Hi guys!
[08:06:08] <Bloomberg> I have a problem removing the last section in a var
[08:06:36] <Bloomberg> if I have this var some = firstsecond/third/four
[08:06:47] <Bloomberg> some = first/second/third/four
[08:06:59] <Bloomberg> how can I remove the last section
[08:07:05] <Bloomberg> with jquery
[08:07:12] <redaxmedia> .last() ? lol
[08:07:15] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: No jQuery.
[08:07:31] <Bloomberg> why?
[08:07:39] <decx> is that 4 numbers being divided or whats going on there
[08:07:42] <BillCriswell> You would just use plan javascript there.
[08:07:52] <Bloomberg> how will be?
[08:08:21] <BillCriswell> some.split('/').slice(0,-1).join('/')
[08:08:46] <redaxmedia> why dont you store your data in a array then? ^^
[08:09:45] <BillCriswell> some.slice(0, some.lastIndexOf('/')) could work as well.
[08:09:57] <BillCriswell> Not sure how lastIndexOf() holds up in older browsers, though.
[08:11:27] <Bloomberg> trim.split('/').slice(0,-1).join('/'); this pass the var =
[08:11:38] <Bloomberg> doesn't nothing!
[08:11:46] <BillCriswell> What is trim?
[08:12:06] <Bloomberg> the var
[08:12:15] <rgk> hey on the slider, i have a large slider that only goes between 0 and 15, its a bit clunky
[08:12:18] <Bloomberg> first/second/thirs....
[08:12:32] <rgk> i tried setting the step to a floating number like .25
[08:12:36] <rgk> and it stays at 1
[08:12:40] <rgk> can i make it smoother?
[08:13:00] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: You would need to do var trim = trim.split('/').slice(0,-1).join('/'); to alter trim itself.
[08:13:12] <BillCriswell> Well, not alter... but redfine.
[08:15:48] <redaxmedia> you are doing it wrong
[08:15:58] <redaxmedia> wrong data handling at all - this split crap
[08:16:38] <BillCriswell> Yeah, he should probably just an array to start with.
[08:17:17] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/LqxWC/
[08:17:23] <Bloomberg> here is the problem
[08:17:27] <redaxmedia> correct bill
[08:17:29] <Bloomberg> just remove the last "/"
[08:18:06] <Bloomberg> ready
[08:18:08] <Bloomberg> Thank you
[08:18:11] <BillCriswell> What's the problem?
[08:18:12] <BillCriswell> What?
[08:18:13] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[08:18:40] <Bloomberg> newTr = trim.split('/').slice(0,-2).join('/');
[08:18:52] <Bloomberg> for to remove the last "/" and the last char too
[08:19:11] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/LqxWC/1/
[08:19:14] <Bloomberg> but see this
[08:19:32] <Bloomberg> I need told the last /"
[08:19:39] <Bloomberg> and it's removing
[08:20:17] <BillCriswell> You're a lot of work to help.
[08:21:01] <BillCriswell> so you just want to add a / at the end of trim?
[08:21:07] <Bloomberg> yes
[08:21:19] <BillCriswell> Have you concatenated a string before?
[08:21:26] <Bloomberg> no
[08:21:39] <BillCriswell> So you never did like... foo + 'something'
[08:21:46] <NoiseEee> ah-ha virgin
[08:21:50] <Bloomberg> yes, yes
[08:21:54] <Bloomberg> I'm sorry
[08:22:00] <BillCriswell> Ok.
[08:22:03] <Bloomberg> Of course I wast forgeting
[08:22:07] <Bloomberg> was*
[08:22:07] <BillCriswell> There goes your answer. =)
[08:22:09] <Bloomberg> thank you.
[08:22:30] <javaMan> Hi Guys! I am looking for a U.S. map plugin that allows me to disable some states. Any suggestions?
[08:24:25] <decx> $.fn.ConstitutionalRightToSecede
[08:24:42] <jacobroufa> HA!
[08:25:34] <decx> irrefutable evidence that the founding fathers used camelcase
[08:28:00] <TheEternalAbyss> sorry quick question, what would be a good channel to ask about OpenVPN and such?
[08:29:50] <BillCriswell> TheEternalAbyss: I'd type /list and look through that
[08:30:14] <TheEternalAbyss> ok thanks
[08:30:39] <uskerine> I am returning through JSON text to fill a <textarea> which contains carriage returns. As they are not allowed to be included in a JSON object, what would be a good strategy to move them from database to HTML <textarea> through JSON? -I can change CRs on the server side to whatever is required-
[08:30:40] <uskerine> thanks
[08:31:21] <decx> TheEternalAbyss the official channel is on freenode #openvpn
[08:32:21] <TheEternalAbyss> decx: yup thank you, I found it in list :)
[08:33:51] <okdamn> guys http://pastebin.com/kkhhBHKs why i can't get via XHR a html file on my pc?
[08:33:59] <okdamn> i mean its static site without a server behind
[08:34:34] <okdamn> if i browse the file url i see it
[08:34:38] <redaxmedia> you can use a php proxy with curl if you have cross domain issues
[08:34:57] <okdamn> redaxmedia: wooott but its just an html file in my folder :O
[08:35:18] <redaxmedia> opps ^^
[08:35:33] <okdamn> wondering why i can't get it easly
[08:35:35] <okdamn> :(
[08:35:52] <redaxmedia> this maby only works on a running webserver
[08:36:00] <redaxmedia> otherwise it returns not status code?
[08:36:10] <redaxmedia> just an idea
[08:36:16] <okdamn> could be dack :(
[08:36:42] <BillCriswell> Are you going through file:/// ?
[08:37:53] <okdamn> i'm on local folder i wouldl iketo avoid server
[08:38:00] <okdamn> uff its just 4 pages static site
[08:38:12] <BillCriswell> okdamn: What is in the URL bar?
[08:38:17] <okdamn> file://
[08:38:31] <BillCriswell> Ok, then that's the issue.
[08:38:51] <okdamn> uhmmm ok , but guys do you know if i can submit a static site on github pages?
[08:39:28] <BillCriswell> There's a flag in chrome that would allow you to access other files but I'd have to google it.
[08:39:40] <BillCriswell> okdamn: What does the github page docs say?
[08:39:57] <okdamn> BillCriswell:  trying understanding it i'm not english
[08:41:17] <BillCriswell> pages.github.com is pretty clear
[08:42:51] <duch_kazatel> https://xss-game.appspot.com/
[08:42:58] <duch_kazatel> "
[08:42:59] <duch_kazatel> There will be cake at the end of the test.
[08:47:14] <NoiseEee> nice duch_kazatel
[08:47:38] <duch_kazatel> figured it might help some folks here get it.
[08:49:47] <duch_kazatel> Also, for everybody who has ever doubted their code: http://www.hanselman.com/blog/YouAreNotYourCode.aspx
[08:51:36] <thebope> I hope that guy doesn't doubt his blog posts
[08:52:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Did you get the third
[08:52:37] <BillCriswell> ?
[08:52:41] <thebope> good article though
[08:52:53] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell haven't hit up the XSS thing yet.
[08:52:59] <BillCriswell> Ah ok.
[08:55:28] <BillCriswell> NoiseEee: Did you get the third one?
[08:55:46] <BillCriswell> Nevermind.
[08:55:50] <BillCriswell> <-- dumbass.
[09:04:04] <duch_kazatel> anybody here have any experience with A/B testing solutions?
[09:06:05] <rgk> im currently trying to animate the slider from jquery ui but it still snaps to 1 for each step
[09:06:08] <rgk> any ideas?
[09:07:37] <Sal> hi, i'm having a lot of problems using the swiper.js plugin....
[09:07:46] <Sal> does anyone know an alternative?
[09:08:59] <Sal> or.... is there another way to swipe in and out divs from page with touch and mouse?
[09:09:26] <thebope> http://developers.lyst.com/data/2014/05/10/bayesian-ab-testing/
[09:09:28] <thebope> duch_kazatel,
[09:09:31] <thebope> ^^
[09:09:36] <thebope> I don't but that article looks awesome
[09:13:47] <MalMen> hi
[09:13:49] <MalMen> on selector
[09:14:14] <MalMen> $(".tiny").focus(function() { });
[09:14:23] <MalMen> how can i get this object ?
[09:14:35] <MalMen> the one that is focused
[09:14:53] <MalMen> hmmm
[09:14:56] <MalMen> $(this)
[09:14:58] <MalMen> will try
[09:17:14] <Sal> MalMen, yep, thats it
[09:17:56] <MalMen> that selector should work for anything with the class tiny, right ?
[09:22:33] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Let me know how far you get.
[09:23:22] <BillCriswell> Wasted a lot of time on 4 and I need to finish something haha
[09:24:35] <Sal> MalMen, yep
[09:25:39] <MalMen> not working
[09:25:41] <MalMen> dont know why
[09:25:42] <MalMen> grrrr
[09:32:12] <BillCriswell> MalMen: Do you have <input class="tiny"> or is tiny a parent?
[09:32:47] <Nach0z> <input type="you're not allowed to autofill this or any of the other 30 form fields on this page">
[09:36:01] <rgk> does the slider animate option work for mouse movement?
[09:36:07] <rgk> jquery ui
[09:37:29] <redaxmedia> there is jquery ui touch punch
[09:37:43] <redaxmedia> http://touchpunch.furf.com/
[09:39:59] <rgk> redaxmedia: well what i want is the slider to animate and not look clunky by snapping to each step
[09:40:12] <rgk> it looks great when the min and max values are large
[09:40:18] <rgk> but when they aren't its clunky
[09:40:34] <rgk> it looks when i move the slider via jquery
[09:40:37] <rgk> but not on the mouse event
[09:40:43] <rgk> works*
[09:40:52] <redaxmedia> disable it inside ui and put some css3 transition on it?
[09:42:36] <md1985> Can anyone help with a function question on here?
[09:42:45] <redaxmedia> but thats an suggestion, i never tried it
[09:42:50] <duch_kazatel> md1985 just ask the question -if we can help, we will.
[09:43:52] <md1985> I am basically using <a onclick="toggleGroup(category)"> and I need to get it from my js in here http://pastebin.com/H0K5rYvB is this possible?
[09:44:21] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[09:44:49] <jphase> every time you use onclick attributes god kills a kitten
[09:44:53] <redaxmedia> rgk, if you give me a fiddle - i can try it
[09:45:10] <duch_kazatel> md1 you mean you want to run toggleGroup() when you click on an <a> tag?
[09:45:26] <md1985> yes
[09:45:34] <duch_kazatel> do you have jquery on the page?
[09:45:41] <md1985> I hate killling kittens but on this one test 17 were killed
[09:45:54] <md1985> yes
[09:46:42] <md1985> the onclick in console comes back with toggleGroup is not defined
[09:46:54] <duch_kazatel> first off: http://jsfiddle.net/7sYfQ/
[09:46:57] <duch_kazatel> don't use onclick=
[09:47:17] <duch_kazatel> second off, wrap your js in a document ready if it's in the <head>
[09:47:27] <duch_kazatel> or put your JS right before </body>
[09:47:58] <md1985> yes thats all perfect as all my other js functions are running smoothly
[09:48:59] <rgk> redaxmedia: http://live1.brownrice.com/clients/mauisunseeker.html
[09:49:18] <rgk> the script is quite complex, but if you start the feed and hit control cam
[09:49:25] <duch_kazatel> lastly, you have all your code in that paste wrapped in an IIFE, which is scoping it so you can't access it from outside.
[09:49:26] <rgk> you will see the sliders
[09:49:32] <redaxmedia> error loading player :D
[09:50:11] <rgk> redaxmedia: really? hmmm
[09:50:37] <md1985> might be easier to handle the onclick inside the whole scope then
[09:50:56] <duch_kazatel> md1985 right - don't use onclick= ever :)
[09:51:02] <duch_kazatel> do all your bindings with JS.
[09:51:26] <jphase> think of the kitties! :D
[09:51:41] <redaxmedia> rgk, i'm on linux ... do i need flash for this?
[09:51:43] * jphase plays sarah mcgloughlin
[09:51:59] <rgk> redaxmedia: yeah, and i just broke it anyways lol
[09:52:06] <redaxmedia> lol
[09:52:06] <rgk> redaxmedia: i use linux too, i feel your pain
[09:52:16] <rgk> gentoo linux since about 2005
[09:52:33] <rgk> hell i wouldn't even run anything that used qt, all gtk+ to save memory :P
[09:52:35] <redaxmedia> i have it since 3 days, lol
[09:53:00] <rgk> redaxmedia: what distro?
[09:53:00] <jphase> yay redaxmedia! welcome!
[09:53:07] <redaxmedia> elementary os
[09:53:38] <redaxmedia> i love it, its based on ubuntu
[09:53:53] <redaxmedia> thanks jphase
[09:54:11] <uskerine> I have a form with input's and select's, while this works: $('#viewExistingCatalogItemForm :input').prop("disabled", true);
[09:54:16] <jphase> rhel guy muhself
[09:54:29] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[09:54:32] <uskerine> This does not: $('#viewExistingCatalogItemForm :select').prop("disabled", true);    Any reason on why disabled property can't be applied to select?
[09:54:53] <Bloomberg> which will be the opposite of $(".selector").on('click', function(){...})
[09:55:05] <duch_kazatel> .off()
[09:55:25] <jphase> uskerine: do you mean :selected ?
[09:55:28] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg but i'd rethink your strategory if you find yourself needing to unbind things.
[09:55:41] <jphase> I don't believe :select is a selector afaik
[09:55:50] <uskerine> i am trying to select all <select > tags
[09:55:56] <uskerine> maybe i am not using properly the :
[09:55:57] <jphase> uskerine: then just take out the :
[09:56:01] <duch_kazatel> uskerine then drop the :
[09:56:05] <uskerine> thanks
[09:56:07] <duch_kazatel> '#viewExistingCatalogItemForm select'
[09:56:18] <redaxmedia> Bloomberg, you better use a custom event and then you can do .off('myEvent')
[09:56:19] <duch_kazatel> if it's an element name, there's nothing special about it.
[09:56:19] <Bloomberg> some like in php if(!$something){}
[09:56:23] <uskerine> well ,same applies for :input, right?
[09:56:32] <uskerine> it shoud be #fooForm input
[09:56:33] <jphase> uskerine: no, :input is all input elements
[09:56:34] <duch_kazatel> uskerine you can just use input
[09:56:39] <jphase> ^
[09:56:50] <uskerine> understood
[09:56:51] <uskerine> thanks
[09:56:52] <jphase> :input grabs selects and textareas and such too
[09:56:53] <md1985> duch_kazatel: one quick question in the toggle function I am trying to get the map markers category that is assigned in the marker when added to the map to be toggled when you click an item that has the same category as the marker to toggle it. Would you know the best approach to that?
[09:56:58] <Bloomberg> I select an option and this automatically turn on, but if I selecte outside this option I need turn off
[09:57:08] <Bloomberg> Is like this
[09:57:26] <duch_kazatel> md1985 you whatnow.
[09:57:29] <redaxmedia> click and select is the wrong way... better use change
[09:57:47] <duch_kazatel> md1985 i don't know what you're talking about.  "marker"?  "category"?
[09:58:11] <duch_kazatel> md1985 could you use jsfiddle and create a functioning example?
[09:58:35] <md1985> no worries thats okay I will have a look at this a bit more
[09:59:00] <duch_kazatel> md1985 if you need to reference back to the element that ran the function, $(this) is the element.
[10:05:23] <rocky> i want to lay out a set of images with various widths and heights similar to how google images does it... is there a simple jquery plugin around someplace for that? having trouble finding anything on google
[10:08:31] <BillCriswell> Damn I hate naming variables sometimes.
[10:10:04] <BillCriswell> I also keep forgetting how much I can actually do with .data()! !!!
[10:10:11] <BillCriswell> Ok, need something to eat I think.
[10:10:16] <erming> beer
[10:11:28] <salochinBD> beer always works for me
[10:18:31] <BillCriswell> I can't just have 1 beer though. 1 beer makes me want to nap. Would need at least three for it to be beneficial to me.
[10:19:05] <redaxmedia> word
[10:20:12] <BillCriswell> The thing that sucks is at 3 I just want to drink more haha
[10:20:41] <redaxmedia> you should try vodka or similar stuff
[10:21:20] <BillCriswell> I get weird on hard liquor.
[10:21:29] <BillCriswell> Don't like the stories I hear haha
[10:25:16] <BillCriswell> That walk helped though.
[10:25:43] <frank_o> I find myself unable to dev properly for at least a week after drinking
[10:26:10] <frank_o> Strange the way it affects ones passion / creativity
[10:26:21] <BillCriswell> frank_o: There's a certain point where it's amazing, anything before or after that is normally not good.
[10:26:31] <BillCriswell> It's called "The Ballmer Peak" haha
[10:26:43] <BillCriswell> frank_o: http://xkcd.com/323/
[10:26:44] <frank_o> hehe :)
[10:31:55] <BillCriswell> $foo.data('parent', $foo.parent()) so glad I thought to use data like that haha
[10:32:02] <BillCriswell> Probably obvious for most.
[10:34:01] <Kambfhase> BillCriswell: That would be super useful is you start moving $foo around :)
[10:34:32] <BillCriswell> Kambfhase: Exactly why I'm using it.
[10:34:44] <BillCriswell> For draggables, when the need to go back to where they started.
[10:36:01] <BillCriswell> I had the like data-id="3" on two things originally, blah.
[10:38:47] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell you got stuck on level three earlier - that one focuses on editing the hash, right?
[10:40:58] <duch_kazatel> hah got it.
[10:53:37] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell did you get level 5?
[11:06:12] <d0de> can I sort by date in the format "Thu, 29 May 2014 10:30:00 -0700" ?
[11:06:40] <d0de> obv I can sort by creating a new date object and doing getTime(), but I have to do this thousands of times so was wondering if I can sort without conversion
[11:10:35] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I got stuck on the counter one.
[11:10:47] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I think it was level 4.
[11:10:57] <BillCriswell> I gave up like... 5 minutesin.
[11:10:58] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell woo i beat it!
[11:11:07] <BillCriswell> Felt myself getting annoyed so I stopped haha.
[11:11:23] <duch_kazatel> felt good to get it.
[11:11:37] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: What did you have to do for 4? I got the output in the console to be what I wanted but the alert wouldn't fire.
[11:12:21] <damasceno> Does anyone know how can I create a page like this: http://www.stayonsearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Mobile-App-Design.png I'm using Jquery Mobile and I need to create a menu like this, using icons.
[11:13:06] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell if you watch the console, it's trying to execute whatever you enter as valid JS, preceded by startTimer(' and followed by ')
[11:13:34] <duch_kazatel> so you just need to put anything in there that causes that to be a valid statement.
[11:13:37] <duch_kazatel> like, say, ');alert('lol'
[11:13:48] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Could have swore I tried that.
[11:13:53] <BillCriswell> What browser did you go it on?
[11:13:57] <duch_kazatel> did you have the semi in there?
[11:14:00] <duch_kazatel> firefox.
[11:14:01] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:14:07] <BillCriswell> Oh, I was trying in Chrome.
[11:14:15] <duch_kazatel> let me try in chrome.
[11:14:17] <BillCriswell> I wonder if that was the issue lol
[11:15:10] <BillCriswell> damasceno: That's nothing more than a media query really. .icon { width: 25%; } @media ( min-width: Npx ) { .icon { width: 50%; } }
[11:16:45] <damasceno> BillCriswell: thanks.
[11:16:52] <BillCriswell> damasceno: No problem.
[11:17:08] <BillCriswell> Npx would obviously be that width for portrait orientation.
[11:22:50] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell hah - chrome handles it differently.
[11:22:58] <duch_kazatel> you have to do an IIFE in there.
[11:23:07] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I thought I even tried that
[11:23:09] <duch_kazatel> ');(function(){alert('lol')})()(' works
[11:24:49] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Copy and pasted that exactly and still no dice.
[11:24:59] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell O.O that's... funky.
[11:25:00] <BillCriswell> http://xss-game.appspot.com/level4/frame?timer=');(function(){alert('lol')})()('
[11:25:54] <duch_kazatel> i had to put that in the input field to get it to work.
[11:26:28] <BillCriswell> Ah, there it goes.
[11:27:29] <d0de> Hah. I just tested building one giant array in the RSS thing I've been playing around with. The results are... impressive
[11:27:46] <d0de> I may have to revisit the assumption that I have to get fresh feeds for every search
[11:27:56] <d0de> as that assumption is a little bit idiotic
[11:28:01] <duch_kazatel> :)
[11:28:13] <duch_kazatel> doing everything in browser?  or anything server-side?
[11:29:31] <d0de> I was pretty much treating the feeds API as a magic box before X-(
[11:29:42] <d0de> doing everything in browser
[11:29:49] <duch_kazatel> i like that.
[11:29:51] <duch_kazatel> good practice :)
[11:30:50] <d0de> I've been worrying about the speeds of text search and sorting arrays and stuff, and then realized that just storing the actual feed objects locally speeds everything up by about 10,000%
[11:30:58] <d0de> it's incredibly obvious, really
[11:31:10] <duch_kazatel> don't prematurely optimize :)
[11:34:01] <d0de> yeah :) I just can't get over how *fast* it is, it's doing a full text search of thousands of different entries, each of which is thousands of words long, and it takes milliseconds
[11:37:14] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Level 5 was insanely easy compared to 4
[11:37:33] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell right?!  the last one was a facepalm one for me, too.
[11:41:24] <duch_kazatel> http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/05/29/mystery-jquery-object-syntax-basic-introduction/ -  a good primer on JS
[11:41:27] <duch_kazatel> *jquery
[11:44:11] <onenine90> Hey guys. Is it bad to load all my data sent from my PHP controller, to the view, all into the javascript, rather than directly into HTML
[11:44:33] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 totally depends.
[11:44:43] <d0de> {{ next }} <- what do those double curly brackets mean? is it a templating thing?
[11:44:52] <duch_kazatel> d0de usually yeah.
[11:44:57] <onenine90> duch_kazatel what are a couple things I should think about before making that decision
[11:45:07] <onenine90> besides security and sensitive data sent to the client side
[11:45:09] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 you can't do it with the entire page, and you probably shouldn't.
[11:45:18] <onenine90> not the entire page
[11:45:24] <onenine90> but just certain elements
[11:45:37] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 are they at all dynamic?
[11:45:50] <onenine90> say, I'll write the <ul></ul> in HTML / the .php file
[11:45:59] <onenine90> And then send the <li> elements as a JSON object to the view
[11:46:06] <onenine90> and just parse it and insert it into the DOM on page load
[11:46:08] <onenine90> or before page load
[11:46:13] <onenine90> as well as images
[11:46:27] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 i'd avoid doing that personally - i prefer that the first pageload rely as little on JS as possible, just in case.
[11:46:43] <onenine90> duch_kazatel but what if we REQUIRE javascript
[11:46:47] <onenine90> or else you shouldnt be using our platform
[11:46:50] <onenine90> kinda like facebook
[11:47:00] <duch_kazatel> what's your audience?
[11:47:12] <onenine90> e-commerce platform / application
[11:47:14] <onenine90> not an e-commerce store
[11:47:17] <duch_kazatel> then you want a fallback.
[11:47:20] <onenine90> a pretty crazy platform
[11:47:22] <onenine90> with a designer
[11:47:24] <onenine90> etc
[11:48:00] <duch_kazatel> sure - have a fallback.  you can try to make it rely on JS, but having a sane fallback in the event that JS breaks (especially if you're building just a platform) is a really good idea.
[11:48:10] <onenine90> ok duch_kazatel
[11:48:22] <onenine90> But the designer itself, which is completely built with javascript, ajax calls, etc,
[11:48:31] <onenine90> the fallback would just say, hey you need javascript sorry
[11:48:40] <duch_kazatel> one of your top priorities should always be "make sure the user can add to cart and check out.  no matter what."
[11:48:41] <onenine90> but the other parts of our site, like the product catalog, could have a good fallback with the iamge, etc.
[11:48:49] <onenine90> good point
[11:48:56] <onenine90> but in the case where they have to design first
[11:48:57] <duch_kazatel> for an admin panel kind of thing, sure, do whatever.
[11:48:59] <onenine90> with a javascript app
[11:49:02] <onenine90> doesnt make much sense ?
[11:49:10] <duch_kazatel> anything that faces the general public should have a fallback.
[11:49:17] <duch_kazatel> and be resilient.
[11:49:31] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha, didn't know this was built by google.
[11:49:55] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 makes total sense.  just because your designer requires using js doesn't mean the display should completely fail without it.
[11:50:08] <onenine90> duch_kazatel but a user technically cannot check out
[11:50:12] <onenine90> because they cannot create their product
[11:50:26] <duch_kazatel> onenine90 then i'm not understanding what you're building.
[11:50:26] <onenine90> so in that case, the fallback is just a nice notification to the user to let them know why things are't working
[11:50:35] <duch_kazatel> is this, like, a generator to build themes or something?
[11:50:48] <onenine90> duch_kazatel go to https://www.grubhub.com/
[11:50:51] <onenine90> without javascript
[11:50:57] <duch_kazatel> don't care about them.
[11:50:58] <onenine90> "No Javascript, eh? Sadly, we can't support your crippled internet cruiser.
[11:50:58] <onenine90> Why? Javascript makes GrubHub work and we can't live without it. Ignore the garbage below, switch on script support, and refresh the page."
[11:51:04] <onenine90> they went public duch_kazatel
[11:51:07] <onenine90> very successful
[11:51:18] <onenine90> all im saying is JS is required for us
[11:51:19] <duch_kazatel> sure - i work at a very large, very successful ecommerce company, too.
[11:51:25] <onenine90> duch_kazatel what company
[11:51:29] <onenine90> is it an e-commerce store?
[11:51:32] <duch_kazatel> yes.
[11:51:35] <onenine90> link plz
[11:51:38] <duch_kazatel> no thanks ;)
[11:51:56] <onenine90> k then your argument is invalid
[11:51:59] <duch_kazatel> wat
[11:52:01] <onenine90> thanks for ur feedback though
[11:52:15] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Making a lot of friends lately.
[11:52:20] <duch_kazatel> you didn't answer my question from earlier...
[11:52:35] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell seriously.  people ask for advice then retort with ad hominems.
[11:52:43] <duch_kazatel> am i that abrasive?
[11:53:45] <duch_kazatel> i'm getting closer to changing my name and just giving up on the whole privacy thing.
[11:53:59] <duch_kazatel> because apparently where i work matters.
[11:54:44] <duch_kazatel> oh dude's bitter probably because he can't get any dates on OKCUpid.
[11:55:51] <BillCriswell> Haha
[11:56:01] <BillCriswell> Sorry was getting a bagal.
[11:56:03] <duch_kazatel> cheapchot.  anyway.
[11:56:07] <duch_kazatel> *cheapshot
[11:56:24] <jphase> probably a pretty high probability of it being accurate though :\
[11:56:42] <duch_kazatel> meh.  people like that can believe what they want.  they'll learn the hard way.
[11:57:41] <duch_kazatel> "this company went public and is successful.  therefore this is ok." - sure.  their services are also not being used by people in the midwest with 56k modems
[12:02:21] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[12:38:22] <Fraz> hi
[12:38:49] <Fraz> hw would i go about creating an object within my jquery plugin that i can instance?
[12:40:25] <Fraz> so i can do something like slide[] = new slide(options); and slide.setBackgroundImage(someimage) etc
[12:41:14] <duch_lunch> Fraz the plugin tutorial covers that iirc.
[12:44:13] <Taylor_Karras> anyone an expert with expanding heights
[12:44:21] <duch_lunch> !ask @ Taylor_Karras
[12:44:21] <b-ot> Taylor_Karras: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[12:45:23] <Taylor_Karras> Okay then. I am the owner of a website (http://talknet.taylorkarras.com) and I'm having trouble getting a wrapper to extend to the bottom through conventional means (most evident in http://talknet.taylorkarras.com/people). I have tried tons of code yet it simply doesn't want to work. Does anybody know a solution to my problem?
[12:46:55] <duch_lunch> Taylor_Karras it'll take some modification to what you have now, but you'll wind up with setting min-height: 100% on a containing element.
[12:47:21] <Taylor_Karras> I tried that, it extends beyond the wrapper.
[12:47:40] <duch_lunch> right, because it's setting the height to 100% of the window.
[12:48:18] <Taylor_Karras> ah, didn't know that.
[12:48:29] <duch_lunch> you might have better success over in #css, btw
[12:49:00] <Taylor_Karras> But I want to use a Jquery solution, I have tried everything CSS and it doesn't provide me with the results I need; thanks for the suggestion.
[12:49:13] <duch_lunch> jquery is the wrong tool for this job.
[12:49:16] <duch_lunch> css is the correct tool
[12:50:06] <Taylor_Karras> duch_lunch: It's a wrapper nested inside of another wrapper surrounded by two other divs. A navigation div and a footer div.
[12:50:17] <duch_lunch> i can see that.
[12:51:18] <redaxmedia> duch_lunch is right, CSS is made for things like that
[12:51:40] <duch_lunch> i'd suggest wrapping #top, #header, and #navigation all up in one element btw.
[12:51:40] <redaxmedia> you should never calc dimensions with JS if this is not 100% needed
[12:52:17] <Taylor_Karras> duch_lunch, never thought of that...
[12:52:25] <redaxmedia> you can also use viewport units: http://caniuse.com/viewport-units
[12:52:38] <redaxmedia> VH !
[12:53:21] <duch_lunch> with some extra effort, you can use something like this: http://ryanfait.com/sticky-footer/
[12:53:23] <duch_lunch> pure css
[12:54:57] <duch_lunch> so stoked - we got our kegbot gear today!
[12:55:25] <redaxmedia> they should call it stinky footer
[12:55:42] <redaxmedia> never liked the 100% stuff all arround
[12:55:57] <redaxmedia> and crazy paddings :D
[12:56:31] <duch_lunch> meh, right tool for the job, etc.
[12:58:24] <puchacz> is there a way I can yield() from my long running function so GUI is not frozen?
[12:59:00] <puchacz> I have say 100 elements to process, it takes about 5 seconds, so I can easily yield after every single element
[12:59:03] <duch_kazatel> puchacz that... shouldn't be necessary.  what are you doing that's causing the UI to freeze?
[12:59:09] <duch_kazatel> appending to the document?
[12:59:23] <puchacz> duch_kazatel, yes, first figuring out what to append, then append
[12:59:34] <duch_kazatel> puchacz don't do that - use a fragment instead.
[13:00:05] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: it is offset() that I read (vertical) that takes so much time - I profiled
[13:00:30] <puchacz> so appending is not the heaviest part - it is gathering information where to append
[13:00:37] <duch_kazatel> puchacz i'd need to see your code, but I've used offset() successfully without freezing my UI.
[13:00:45] <puchacz> 100 times?
[13:00:57] <duch_kazatel> i give up.
[13:01:14] <puchacz> also, what do you mean by fragment? can you send me rtfm URL on it please?
[13:01:28] <redaxmedia> puchacz, what about googling for jquery + performance?
[13:01:50] <redaxmedia> you have to learn about caching, dom manipulation best practices etc. i guess
[13:02:41] <puchacz> redaxmedia: I googled, and it boils down to a native function getBoundingClientRect(), exactly as I observed when profiling
[13:02:54] <redaxmedia> finally you can use jsperf.com to test your code changes
[13:02:56] <NaN> does $.ajax has a progress method? I would like to calculate the uploaded/downloaded bytes for a visual progress indicator, any clue?
[13:03:16] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: what is a fragment?
[13:03:24] <duch_kazatel> i all ready told you i give up.
[13:03:33] <puchacz> ah, you gave up to this one
[13:03:35] <puchacz> ok
[13:03:53] <duch_kazatel> you refused to listen to my initial advice - until you share code, i give up :)
[13:04:27] <duch_kazatel> NaN no, but there plugins out there that will help you do tat.
[13:04:49] <NaN> duch_kazatel: couldn't find one
[13:04:53] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/englercj/jquery-ajax-progress
[13:04:56] <puchacz> ok, got fragment
[13:05:03] <NaN> nice, thanks duch_kazatel
[13:05:17] <puchacz> still - can I yield?
[13:05:25] <NaN> duch_kazatel: have you used it?
[13:05:30] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[13:05:40] <puchacz> or I would have to rewrite my code to process a single element in a single function, have a queue etc.
[13:06:42] <duch_kazatel> puchacz there are plans to add a yeild down the road, but your code should be written in a way to not require them.
[13:07:20] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: is there a 3rd party library that can do it? I can't imagine how it can be implemented
[13:07:29] <duch_kazatel> yield?  no.
[13:07:37] <puchacz> ok, thx
[13:07:48] <duch_kazatel> can you provide some sample code to illustrate what's so slow?
[13:08:06] <duch_kazatel> I understand it's the use of offset(), but there are ways to mitigate that pain.
[13:08:47] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: I have it on my test server only, but thanks for the offer :-)
[13:09:00] <duch_kazatel> you can't provide a simplified fiddle?
[13:09:37] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: ok, I will think how to do it
[13:10:16] <puchacz> the problem is we need a complex document for it
[13:10:45] <puchacz> anyway :-)
[13:10:53] <duch_kazatel> you shouldn't need to do that.  i don't care if you can't replicate the performance hit in this case - i'm simply curious to see what you're doing that's causing the browser to lock up.
[13:11:19] <Bloomberg> guys!!
[13:11:48] <Bloomberg> What propertie you suggest me for to do a uploader bar with ajax in jquery
[13:11:54] <Bloomberg> beforesend, success.....
[13:12:05] <duch_kazatel> Bloomberg beforesend and done()
[13:12:34] <duch_kazatel> done isn't a property though - you chain it on.
[13:12:42] <Bloomberg> ok
[13:12:43] <Bloomberg> thank lyou
[13:12:45] <Bloomberg> *
[13:13:25] <BillCriswell> recruiters are getting lazy.
[13:13:29] <BillCriswell> "Conversation?"
[13:13:32] <duch_kazatel> puchacz why did you PM me?
[13:13:34] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell D:
[13:13:43] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell that's pretty bad.
[13:14:08] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: you want to see the problematic code, I don't want to litter the channel
[13:14:24] <BillCriswell> puchacz: Littering the channel is good. More people could see it.
[13:14:25] <duch_kazatel> puchacz then paste it in a fiddle...
[13:14:39] <duch_kazatel> but talking about it here is good - other people may have very good suggestions.
[13:15:45] <duch_kazatel> in fact, they normally do!
[13:19:22] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/YFLzD/1/
[13:19:41] <puchacz> but it does not want to work with HTML manually put into iframe
[13:19:46] <puchacz> hold on, I know
[13:20:20] <duch_kazatel> no need to use that iframe...
[13:20:34] <il> does jquery have a function equivalent to php's sleep() function?
[13:21:29] <BillCriswell> il: You could use a setTimeout().
[13:22:02] <duch_kazatel> puchacz what do you need the offset info for in the first place?
[13:22:10] <duch_kazatel> also, you're creating an array and then not using it...
[13:22:20] <puchacz> of course, it is only the offending part
[13:22:34] <puchacz> I have elements next to iframe that I want to Y-align to specific spans
[13:23:14] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: I updated: http://jsfiddle.net/YFLzD/3/ but it still does not work
[13:23:20] <puchacz> but you should see the idea
[13:23:23] <il> thats stupid
[13:23:31] <il> how hard is it to make a sleep functin
[13:23:57] <duch_kazatel> puchacz something about this seems... off to me.  but first off topOfSpans isn't being used as an array.  make that an object instead.
[13:23:58] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: I just want to look for things in iframe, then Y-align things on the right in main document to them
[13:24:29] <duch_kazatel> puchacz second of all - what's the deal with the iframe?  what's this being used for?  i see why you're using it now, but i don't understand your choice for that solution.
[13:24:46] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: because I have full external webpage there
[13:25:43] <duch_kazatel> i'm not stupid - I know what iframes are used for ;)  why are you using one here?  like, why can't you simply include that content in your page?
[13:25:48] <duch_kazatel> or is this some kind of cross-domain thing?
[13:26:58] <markd1985> Hi can anyone help with a quick kquery issue?
[13:27:03] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ markd1985
[13:27:03] <b-ot> markd1985: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[13:27:05] <markd1985> sorry *jquery
[13:27:18] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: cross domain, and I don't think I can isolate css without iframe
[13:27:36] <puchacz> css for my page vs foreign css
[13:27:40] <BillCriswell> I wish there was a css kill call.
[13:27:50] <duch_kazatel> puchacz what is this app actually doing?
[13:27:50] <BillCriswell> .el { cascade: false } or something haha
[13:27:56] <duch_kazatel> your requirements seem really strange to me.
[13:28:29] <puchacz> duch_kazatel - have some things generated by my server showing some fragments on external webpage
[13:28:38] <puchacz> like "dear user, look here"
[13:28:43] <markd1985> Okay I have created filters to perform a function that when clicked operates a toggle based on the id of the clicked element. Does anyone know the best approach to this?
[13:28:54] <duch_kazatel> puchacz to what end?
[13:29:00] <puchacz> no worries :-)
[13:29:26] <duch_kazatel> why do people evade questions like that?  they try as hard as possible to not say "I'm making a page that displays other pages to read words"
[13:29:52] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: nothing really ominous about me passing
[13:30:08] <puchacz> I just don't see it is progressing towards my performance issue
[13:30:33] <duch_kazatel> puchacz actually it does - perhaps you don't need to do what you're doing in the way you're doing it.
[13:30:47] <duch_kazatel> if the other box allows CORS< for instance, you can grab the specific bits you need.
[13:31:02] <BillCriswell> markd1985: Pass the option through a data attirubte maybe?
[13:31:04] <__joshua___> markd1895:  your question is very vague. but:  $(button).on('click', function(){ var id = $(this).prop('id);  to_thing(id); });
[13:31:29] <duch_kazatel> or you could pass the external page through your box to a headless browser to generate the data you want before you ship to the browser
[13:31:33] <__joshua___> but yeah, I would use a data attribute for this
[13:31:57] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: this is the sole requirement. have divs from my server aligned to external webpage. there can be notes, translations etc.
[13:32:03] <markd1985> BillCriswell, __joshua__ I just added to pastie.org http://pastie.org/9236193
[13:32:35] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: so I pass external webpage through my server first
[13:32:47] <puchacz> and put it into iframe
[13:32:49] <puchacz> really, that's it
[13:33:27] <__joshua___> line 30, this.hasClass, should be $(this).hasClass
[13:33:59] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: so given these requirements, I need iframe. and I need to find out where specific elements are (vertically), so I can align.....
[13:34:29] <duch_kazatel> puchacz right - so push the external page through your box to a headless browser and have that do all the offset calculations.
[13:34:54] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: are there examples of this config?
[13:35:02] <duch_kazatel> no, because what you want is unusual.
[13:35:09] <markd1985> __joshua__ what is the best way to toggle these items based on the attributes of the items clicked?
[13:35:21] <duch_kazatel> puchacz at least, that I know of.  should be pretty simple though.
[13:35:42] <puchacz> I understand I would need to have run headless chrome on my server linux box, correct?
[13:35:51] <duch_kazatel> or phantomjs
[13:36:00] <markd1985> So theidea is you click either events/members and that performs the function to show/hide based on the category clicked on in the list items
[13:36:01] <puchacz> do the rendering there and send Y-offsets to the client
[13:36:07] <duch_kazatel> puchacz yep.
[13:36:10] <__joshua___> markd1985: its a pretty common approach
[13:37:00] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: thanks, I did not know headless browsers existed. it seems complex though, I will see if I can live with my performance problem simply by ignoring it
[13:37:22] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: mind that there is no guarantee that headless browser on server will be any faster
[13:37:38] <puchacz> I could pre-cache probably, if on server
[13:37:42] <duch_kazatel> right.
[13:37:45] <duch_kazatel> that was my point.
[13:37:47] <markd1985> __joshua___ okay so instead of doing the dirty onclick method on the tags whats the best way of getting the correct data I suppose?
[13:37:54] <duch_kazatel> have the server churn that so you don't lock up the UI for the end user...
[13:38:35] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: thanks. at least I have one more option to explore
[13:39:20] <__joshua___> you can do it your way no problem.  I would replace document.getElementById with jquery, for consistency
[13:39:43] <__joshua___> and you seem to have confounded jq and dom functions.
[13:39:55] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: it might be easier to rewrite my code to have single closure for single element processing, and then queue them with setTimeout(c, 10).....
[13:40:06] <puchacz> plus a progress bar maybe
[13:40:08] <markd1985> hmm okay
[13:40:11] <markd1985> hmm okay
[13:40:42] <duch_kazatel> puchacz dunno what the closure has to do with that, but that's another way, though when you start including timeouts into event oriented code you'll have all sorts of wonderful problems.
[13:41:02] <puchacz> closures - prepared tasks
[13:41:11] <duch_kazatel> that's not what that term usually means.
[13:41:17] <markd1985> my only problem I cannot figure out is how can it know which markers to show via the on click in jquery as the params passed through the functions to show/hide are the categories
[13:41:25] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: ok, but you understood
[13:41:36] <duch_kazatel> you mean function?
[13:41:54] <__joshua___> markd1985: make a jsfiddle, and I can help you out
[13:41:54] <puchacz> myQueue.add(function () { do something } );
[13:42:13] <duch_kazatel> that's an anonymous function being passed to a handler.
[13:42:22] <duch_kazatel> also: like I said before, topOfSpans = []; is wrong.
[13:42:26] <duch_kazatel> that should be topOfSpans = {};
[13:42:38] <duch_kazatel> unless annotationId is always a number.
[13:42:38] <puchacz> agree about {}. ok, I am not fussy about naming
[13:42:46] <puchacz> (closure or handler that is)
[13:43:03] <puchacz> (I mean closure or anonymous function)
[13:43:21] <duch_kazatel> closure is a different concept entirely - it's important because otherwise i have no idea what you mean.
[13:44:04] <puchacz> duch_kazatel: no worries, really. if I have 100 of anonymous functions, each with different element to operate on, it is easiest with closures
[13:44:07] <puchacz> ymmv
[13:44:15] <duch_kazatel> wat.
[13:44:17] <puchacz> same code, different span
[13:44:25] <duch_kazatel> you're convluting things.
[13:45:06] <duch_kazatel> myQueue.add(myFunction); - myFunction is just a function.
[13:45:12] <puchacz> ok, let's not get into mode "somebody is wrong on the internet, I need to keep clarifying it"
[13:45:24] <duch_kazatel> i'm honestly trying to understand wtf you mean.
[13:45:31] <puchacz> ok
[13:45:32] <duch_kazatel> but okay.
[13:46:01] <duch_kazatel> it will become important for you to learn the proper terminology for these btw.,
[13:46:22] <puchacz> function addTask(span) {myQueue.add(function () {span.doSomething(); }); }
[13:46:36] <puchacz> the anonymous function being added to a handler is capturing span
[13:47:10] <puchacz> as long as we can discuss jquery, we are free to believe that the other side is wrong about closures :-)
[13:47:19] <duch_kazatel> not really - closure has a specific meaning.
[13:47:26] <duch_kazatel> but whatever.
[13:47:30] <puchacz> :-)
[13:47:38] <duch_kazatel> i'm done with this.
[13:47:44] <jhjohnson> scope vs closure
[13:48:02] <jhjohnson> aaaannnd he's gone
[13:48:17] <__joshua___> hey hes always here.  good one puchacz
[13:49:15] <puchacz> he will be back
[13:50:09] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/HwX5n/
[13:50:20] <Bloomberg> in this scrit doesn't works the beforesend
[13:50:21] <Bloomberg> why?
[13:52:17] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Are you sure that plugin has a beforeSend option?
[13:52:37] <__joshua___> Bloomberg:  and why even bother with beforeSend.
[13:52:49] <__joshua___> I mean, that code is executed before send.
[13:53:27] <__joshua___> beforesend, in $.ajax, is used to modify the xhr
[13:53:29] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: You could simple put $("#files").html('<a>loading...</a>'); inside the .submit event.
[13:53:33] <__joshua___> you don't want to do that
[13:53:41] <__joshua___> you want to do what BillCriswell says
[13:54:04] <markd1985> Hi __joshua__ here is the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/pQWxS/
[13:55:42] <Bloomberg> really I'm not sure if allow the option
[13:55:45] <Bloomberg> I'm going to see
[13:55:57] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Skip the the things we say after.
[13:56:37] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Also, the plugin suggests using ajaxStart and ajaxComplete, both of which can be found here: http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/global-ajax-event-handlers/
[13:57:32] <Bloomberg> ok
[13:57:39] <Bloomberg> ues it's ajaxStart
[13:58:14] <BillCriswell> Bloomberg: Keep in mind that would happen for ALL ajax events and not just this one.
[13:59:28] <markd1985> __joshua__ hopefully the code makes sense :|
[14:03:28] <__joshua___> markd1985: so using ol?
[14:03:59] <__joshua___> are you trying to do popups on the map?
[14:04:04] <hartvig> http://jsfiddle.net/hartviglarsen/d3Tc9/ - It's stuck at [1]. How do I fix that?
[14:04:52] <Bloomberg> Ok
[14:05:42] <markd1985> __joshua__ ol?
[14:05:49] <__joshua___> openlayers
[14:06:01] <__joshua___> or just googlemaps,.. right
[14:06:01] <markd1985> yes
[14:06:19] <markd1985> google maps is what I am using yes
[14:06:39] <__joshua___> and what should clicking 1 or those two links do?
[14:07:11] <markd1985> it should show/hide the markers related to that category id clicked
[14:07:33] <markd1985> This is what has been messing with my mind
[14:07:43] <__joshua___> ah ok.  give me a few
[14:08:40] <__joshua___> mind if i remove everything else?
[14:09:11] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/sWf7Q/
[14:09:18] <Bloomberg> that's my script
[14:09:29] <Bloomberg> dfinitely soedn't works the sjaxstart
[14:09:34] <Bloomberg> ajaxStart*
[14:09:42] <markd1985> ahhhhh yes thats fine
[14:09:57] <markd1985> *sheds a tear
[14:11:10] <Hackwar1> hi folks, I cloned a row in a table with a bunch of form fields, among them a select field. Now when I'm sending the form, everything works, except that the select field's value is not send. What am I doing wrong? Do I have to set the selectedIndex again or something?
[14:25:18] <__joshua___> markd1985:  one way to do it http://jsfiddle.net/pQWxS/6/
[14:26:08] <__joshua___> let me show you the attribute way now
[14:26:26] <markd1985> __joshua__ ah okay thats a great idea

[15:05:25] <frank_o> nvm got it
[15:25:05] <damoncasale> Afternoon, folks...
[15:25:16] <damoncasale> Having a $(note).clone issue.
[15:25:19] <damoncasale> Er, node.
[15:26:24] <damoncasale> I'm attempting to clone a form.  One of the fields in the form has just been changed (with the "change" event being triggered).  The form's innerHTML and outerHTML is incorrect, showing the previous state of the form, even tho the element's value (jQuery(elm).val()) is correct.
[15:26:42] <damoncasale> I tried using clone(true, true) but it still shows the incorrect HTML.
[15:26:44] <damoncasale> Help?
[15:27:16] <duch_kazatel> damoncasale "ote: For performance reasons, the dynamic state of certain form elements (e.g., user data typed into textarea and user selections made to a select) is not copied to the cloned elements. When cloning input elements, the dynamic state of the element (e.g., user data typed into text inputs and user selections made to a checkbox) is retained in the cloned elements."
[15:27:33] <damoncasale> No kidding.  But don't the parameters (true, true) override that??
[15:27:50] <duch_kazatel> no.
[15:27:55] <damoncasale> Why the hell not??
[15:28:09] <duch_kazatel> refer back to what I just pasted ;)
[15:28:26] <damoncasale> So how do I do that?
[15:28:54] <damoncasale> I really, really, REALLY need to do that.
[15:28:55] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3250685/is-there-a-way-to-clone-form-field-values-in-jquery-or-javascript

[15:29:04] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Is there a way to clone form field values in jQuery or javascript ... → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3250685/is-there-a-way-to-clone-form-field-values-in-jquery-or-javascript
[15:29:46] <damoncasale> Okay, that helps.
[15:29:55] <damoncasale> I kept trying to google and wasn't getting good results.
[15:30:13] <damoncasale> Slightly more complicated since the form elements in question are selects, but at least now I know what approach to use.
[15:30:20] <duch_kazatel> not really.
[15:30:48] <daraand> Hello everyone :) Does anyone have any jQuery/Safari mobile experience for a quick video question?
[15:31:07] <damoncasale> Not $(elm).attr('value', x) for a select, right?
[15:31:59] <duch_kazatel> damoncasale you want .val()
[15:32:02] <duch_kazatel> or .prop('val')
[15:32:14] <damoncasale> Ok.
[15:32:22] <duch_kazatel> err, .prop('value')
[15:32:25] <damoncasale> k
[15:32:34] <daraand> I guess I should just ask it: I know mobile safari, on an iPad, disables autoplay. I have an anchor that will display a video. I've setup a play() on that video, but it doesn't seem to play, it just loads the poster. I can send over an example if it helps, boggling my mind though.
[16:00:03] <__joshua___> anyone familiar with globally adding/removing callbacks to $.ajax?  ie, the removal of $(document).ajaxSend(func)
[16:03:09] <NaN> __joshua___: what do you want to do?
[16:03:25] <duch_kazatel> __joshua___ you mean the global ajax events?
[16:15:18] <__joshua___> yeah
[16:16:15] <xingped> hey, can anyone take a look at this small code snippet? I can't figure out why the last line of jquery doesn't seem to want to work... http://pastebin.com/d2B5DSW3
[16:16:16] <__joshua___> for the life time of one of my views it want to globally add a param to all ajax calls.  ($(document).ajaxSend(func)).  But i need to remove the handler when the view is destroyed.
[16:17:29] <__joshua___> xingped: are you sure it doesn't append to the original select element?.  your multlselect object needs to be updated.
[16:17:55] <xingped> ohhh, okay, yeah, that makes sense, let me give that a try
[16:18:57] <xingped> yep, that was it, thank you very much!
[16:27:05] <bowenac> anyone familiar with bootstrap modals? I am trying to trigger a jquery click inside the body of the modal but it never gets triggered
[16:27:33] <bowenac> so like next previous buttons inside the modal to show different parts of divs etc
[16:27:33] <erming> how does your .on("click", ... look like?
[16:27:45] <bowenac> $(".button gform_next_button").on("click", function(){
[16:28:05] <erming> gform_next_button, is that a custom element, or what?
[16:28:09] <bowenac> do I need to add body in that or something maybe it doesn't see it
[16:28:20] <erming> or is gform_next_button a class?
[16:28:21] <bowenac> its a class of a button that is in the content of the modal
[16:28:45] <erming> <a class="button gform_next_button"> ?
[16:28:49] <erming> is that how it looks like
[16:29:23] <bowenac> <input type="button" onclick="jQuery(&quot;#gform_target_page_number_1&quot;).val(&quot;2&quot;); jQuery(&quot;#gform_1&quot;).trigger(&quot;submit&quot;,[true]); " tabindex="51" value="Next" class="button gform_next_button" id="gform_next_button_1_3">
[16:29:43] <erming> your selector should look like this then
[16:29:48] <bowenac> actually like that but that doesn't seem to work
[16:29:50] <erming> $(".button.gform_next_button")
[16:30:04] <duch_kazatel> woah wtf is with the onclick= in there.
[16:30:05] <bowenac> so I was trying to manually trigger the click since the button code has its own onclick that isn't working
[16:30:31] <bowenac> its a gravity form
[16:30:38] <erming> $(".button.gform_next_button").on("click", function() { alert("wohoo"); });
[16:30:38] <bowenac> gravity forms plugin
[16:30:39] <erming> try it
[16:31:30] <bowenac> that worked
[16:31:37] <erming> now remove the onclick-stuff :D
[16:32:02] <erming> and put all that code inside your, now working, click event function
[16:32:25] <bowenac> I can't unless I edit the plugin shortcode
[16:32:40] <bowenac> what would be preventing the onclick in the button from working anyway?
[16:34:17] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:34:29] <duch_kazatel> do you have a separate js file you can edit?
[16:35:00] <bowenac> why wouldnt the default button work is what I am asking... I can copy the same jquery they are using and get it to work. Just curious why it isn't working how it is.
[16:35:11] <bowenac> Yes I have my own script that I have for the plugin that I am writing
[16:35:11] <erming> not sure why the onclick doesnt work.. you don't get any error?
[16:35:27] <bowenac> but in my plugin I am loading the gravity form inside of a modal
[16:35:34] <bowenac> which has its own code etc
[16:35:35] <duch_kazatel> dunno without seeing it in action.
[16:35:53] <erming> oh
[16:36:02] <erming> bowenac, you cant have "-quotes inside that onclick
[16:36:17] <erming> onclick="quotes"mess"stuff_up"
[16:36:26] <erming> use single quotes: '
[16:36:35] <duch_kazatel> jQuery('#gform_target_page_number_1').val('2'); jQuery('#gform_1').trigger('submit',[true]);
[16:36:44] <bowenac> ummm no idea what you mean its a very successfull plugin
[16:36:48] <bowenac> works just fine on a page
[16:36:53] <duch_kazatel> what plugin is this?
[16:36:59] <bowenac> just doesnt work inside of a bootstrap modal
[16:37:02] <bowenac> gravity forms
[16:37:34] <bowenac> I think they know how to code jquery
[16:37:45] <bowenac> it's something specific to it trying to run inside the modal
[16:37:50] <duch_kazatel> if they're using onclick in their markup, they do not.
[16:38:13] <bowenac> how else would you do it when those feilds are dynamically added?
[16:38:19] <duch_kazatel> event delegation.
[16:38:23] <bowenac> depending on the amount of fields you add to your form
[16:38:27] <bowenac> and the amount of forms you have
[16:38:28] <bowenac> etc
[16:38:29] <duch_kazatel> event delegation.
[16:38:31] <erming> parent.on("click", ".button", function() { ... });
[16:38:44] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[16:39:06] <erming> where parent is static (might even be the <body>).. then you can dynamically swap stuff out, and the events will still work
[16:40:02] <duch_kazatel> i'd avoid binding to body personally, but yeah basically.
[16:40:57] <bowenac> must have been a reason for doing it this way wouldn't you think?
[16:41:09] <duch_kazatel> lack of understanding events.
[16:41:16] <duch_kazatel> probably.
[16:42:01] <bowenac> lol sure thats it haha
[16:42:13] <duch_kazatel> ?
[16:42:36] <duch_kazatel> i'm dead serious.  just because a wordpress plugin is "successful" doesn't mean it's written well.
[16:43:48] <bowenac> I think that is just your opinion and assumption of why its not working in a modal... but works perfect anywhere else you put it
[16:43:53] <bowenac> that doesn't make sense to me.
[16:44:01] <duch_kazatel> no, i'm saying the code is poorly written.
[16:44:04] <duch_kazatel> i'm not talking about the modal.
[16:44:20] <bowenac> what is poor about that if it works
[16:44:25] <bowenac> you just said it breaks things
[16:44:34] <bowenac> I'm just curious is all
[16:44:48] <duch_kazatel> it's inefficient and puts logic inside of data.
[16:44:52] <bowenac> I mean erming used quotes in his example above
[16:44:53] <duch_kazatel> that's exactly the wrong way to do that.
[16:45:00] <erming> bowenac, i also thing onclick sucks
[16:45:30] <duch_kazatel> and it's probably broken for that modal because the content in the modal isn't recognized correctly.
[16:45:40] <erming> but i find it's usually easier to just help people get their stuff to work, and let them figure out good/bad ways to develop software the hard way :>
[16:45:41] <duch_kazatel> something tells me it's cloned markup, or generated when you launch it.
[16:46:07] <erming> lets say you want to use the same even for different buttons
[16:46:15] <erming> instead of just adding a class, and call it a day
[16:46:19] <erming> you'll copy paste the code
[16:46:46] <erming> event*
[16:46:53] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[16:47:00] <duch_kazatel> also - what happens when you change the ID?
[16:47:05] <duch_kazatel> you now have to update every place you put it.
[16:47:12] <duch_kazatel> abstraction is a big deal.
[16:48:06] <erming> we're only trying to help here
[16:48:43] <duch_kazatel> word.
[16:48:59] <duch_kazatel> these are things i wish i had been told long before i figured them out on my own.
[16:52:51] <bowenac> I get what you guys are saying and that is how I usually do it...
[16:53:49] <bowenac> but that doesn't explain why it isn't working. They include js files for everything else that the form is doing, but that is how they are doing it for the buttons so to me it seems obvious there is a reason, otherwise why wouldn't they have just included it in the js file they are already including
[16:54:07] <duch_kazatel> did you see my remark earlier about why it might be broken?
[16:54:41] <duch_kazatel> the markup in the modal likely isn't "registered" correctly against something.
[16:54:57] <duch_kazatel> it probably doesn't exist on pageload, which means it's not initializing correctly.
[17:37:18] <frank_o> https://github.com/josscrowcroft/money.js.git <3
[17:37:32] <duch_kazatel> neat
[17:43:28] <queuetip> that is neat. currently i'm using symfony and using lexik currency bundle, but money.js looks like a nice front end alternative
[17:58:32] <frank_o> Anybody know how to convert $100 USD to GBP? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/qLqud/2/
[18:01:22] <BillCriswell> frank_o: http://josscrowcroft.github.io/money.js/ looks pretty promising
[18:02:35] <frank_o> BillCriswell: yeah :)
[18:02:45] <jphase> looks like he's trying to use it, but fx no worky
[18:03:08] <queuetip> frank_o: don't you have to include it on that page in jsfiddle? how is fx() function even supposed to work on jsfiddle if you don't include the lib?
[18:03:13] <frank_o> thats right no worky tworky
[18:03:18] <jphase> it is included
[18:03:19] <jphase> just no worky
[18:03:26] <jphase> well, not how the readme specifies anyhow
[18:03:35] <queuetip> oh nevermind i see it
[18:04:02] <queuetip> frank_o: where's jquery?
[18:04:21] <frank_o> yep. i included accounting.js to hopefully get the symbols right too
[18:04:30] <frank_o> queuetip: oops -- http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/qLqud/3/
[18:04:30] <queuetip> oh nevermind, i'm not used to this updated jsfiddle
[18:04:32] <jphase> jquery is in there
[18:04:34] <jphase> hehe
[18:04:43] <queuetip> yeah it's 2.1 i noticed it
[18:05:07] <frank_o> ah yeah true true
[18:05:17] <Jattenalle> why does that fx money lib not have a license? :/
[18:05:42] <jphase> I'd hope hope that it works with 2.x
[18:05:47] <jphase> it *should*   ... :(
[18:06:46] <queuetip> frank_o: var source = $('.source');
[18:06:47] <queuetip> alert(source);
[18:06:54] <queuetip> frank_o: object object
[18:07:16] <frank_o> mo monies mo prollems !!
[18:07:40] <queuetip> frank_o: try var source = $('.source');
[18:07:49] <queuetip> oops, $('.source').html();
[18:09:15] <frank_o> queuetip: nice catch.. thx
[18:09:29] <queuetip> frank_o: also that leaves you with : $100 and i think you want 100...
[18:10:05] <frank_o> yep just noticed that as well
[18:10:34] <frank_o> should probably use accounting.js to strip away symbols first before using money.js? and then again after conversion?
[18:12:19] <queuetip> frank_o: also you're getting an error on the fx line... idk why yet
[18:14:40] <BillCriswell> frank_o: You need to do the request to open exchange rates and get the data from there before you can use fx(); apparently.
[18:15:11] <frank_o> BillCriswell: oh i see i see
[18:15:28] <frank_o> was expecting a little bit more magic from fx on that one :)
[18:15:38] <frank_o> queuetip: now stripping away symbols first: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/qLqud/6/
[18:17:27] <frank_o> oh
[18:17:34] <frank_o> and *it* costs money
[18:18:07] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[18:18:41] <frank_o> i guess i would have to scrape some values elsewhere then, damnit
[18:18:54] <queuetip> frank_o: i don't see in that money.js code where they're actually setting the rates, that part might be on you
[18:19:25] <BillCriswell> queuetip: It's in the "Basic Installation" section.
[18:19:33] <queuetip> frank_o: i think you would have to set up the actual api calls to get the exchange rates, and then put them in the default in: https://github.com/josscrowcroft/money.js/blob/master/money.js#L29
[18:20:21] <BillCriswell> How often does GBP change?
[18:20:51] <queuetip> BillCriswell: right, but i don't see that as set up on frank_o's side
[18:20:56] <frank_o> queuetip: yeah im not paying $12/mo just to convert some currencies though
[18:21:15] <queuetip> frank_o: you have to set up the actual exchange rates.. you don't need to use the api calls, you can just hardcode them for now
[18:21:27] <BillCriswell> Right.
[18:21:28] <frank_o> yep sounds good
[18:21:29] <queuetip> frank_o: http://josscrowcroft.github.io/money.js/#basic-install
[18:21:41] <queuetip> frank_o: i think google has a free api for exchange rates anyways
[18:23:02] <frank_o> queuetip: looks like it's shut down
[18:23:18] <LoneStar99> hello all
[18:23:19] <frank_o> queuetip: its actually open exchange rates' value proposition: "Friday 30th May: Looking for an alternative to the shut-down iGoogle calculator/exchange rate service? Open Exchange Rates features up-to-date and historical rates for 165 world currencies, in a simple and reliable JSON API. Get started in minutes!"
[18:24:14] <frank_o> queuetip: cool one sec
[18:24:24] <queuetip> frank_o: http://jsfiddle.net/qLqud/7/
[18:24:37] <queuetip> frank_o: that's a working example now
[18:25:17] <queuetip> frank_o: ah, didn't know that
[18:26:24] <frank_o> hey :)
[18:26:55] <BillCriswell> Wonder how much that value changes (and by how much).
[18:28:40] <frank_o> BillCriswell: arent you supposed to be drunk right now?
[18:28:45] <frank_o> you seem kinda sober :)
[18:29:09] <BillCriswell> frank_o: I went out to drink a bit last night at a meetup, not tonight.
[18:29:24] <frank_o> ah ok
[18:29:33] <BillCriswell> currently working on jquery ui stuff kind of... mostly watching robin hood men in tights.
[18:29:45] <frank_o> havent seen that one in ages
[18:30:16] <BillCriswell> It's on Netflix.
[18:30:33] <frank_o> love that little redhead princess :)
[18:30:43] <BillCriswell> I think the main character was only ever in one movie?
[18:31:10] <frank_o> yeah what happened to that guy
[18:31:33] <BillCriswell> Oh... he's been in more than I thought haha
[18:44:33] <tw2113> Carey Elwes?
[18:45:25] <BillCriswell> tw2113: Yes.
[18:45:49] <tw2113> yeah, he's been in plenty of movies
[18:46:02] <tw2113> i can think of like 3 others off the top of my head
[18:46:10] <tw2113> Princess Bride, Liar Liar, Saw 1
[18:46:18] <BillCriswell> tw2113: I couldn't haha
[18:46:31] <tw2113> but you also took the initiative to look it up
[18:46:56] <BillCriswell> Yes. I couldn't think of one off the top of my head.
[18:47:31] <frank_o> didnt know the princess was in the mask
[18:47:45] <frank_o> damnit where'd queuetip go
[18:47:53] <frank_o> check it out guys: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/qLqud/14/ !!
[18:48:07] <tw2113> i think she was married to John Ritter
[18:48:41] <frank_o> i reckon this calls for https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-oLqMwzvBY (slum village - get dis money)
[18:48:46] * frank_o does his money dance
[18:49:22] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[18:51:22] <BillCriswell> I wonder how many times I've watched Super Troopers.
[19:02:53] <frank_o> BillCriswell: i reckon its not a good idea to be scraping say XE.com for the latest exchange rates on every request?
[19:03:17] <BillCriswell> frank_o: Yeah probably not haha.
[19:03:24] <frank_o> hehe
[19:03:28] <frank_o> ill keep it hardcoded for now
[19:03:53] <Jattenalle> frank_o, just scrape it once a day and save it server-side
[19:04:04] <frank_o> Jattenalle: yep
[19:04:55] <BillCriswell> http://imgur.com/a/Jb6jW pretty awesome.
[19:05:14] <BillCriswell> The UI is better than some I see today even.
[19:05:49] <Jattenalle> i thought it was a fallout custom thing at first
[19:05:51] <Jattenalle> that's neat
[19:06:44] <Jattenalle> that oldschool touch screen as well
[19:07:53] <BillCriswell> Really cool.
[19:09:19] <Alchemy> like it
[19:09:33] <frank_o> cool :)

[19:52:54] <LoneStar99> wanting to copy or clone divs and text within div to another close div --> http://jsfiddle.net/pozrdude/y5CcN/1/
[19:56:39] <BillCriswell> LoneStar99: You're looking for .next()
[19:57:04] <LoneStar99> BillCriswell: ok let me check it out
[19:57:06] <BillCriswell> Though, what you have commented out should work as well.
[19:57:23] <BillCriswell> Oh I see.
[19:58:04] <LoneStar99> BillCriswell:  the commented works, but not sure how to get "clone"  div elements and text...
[19:58:19] <BillCriswell> LoneStar99: You'd use .clone()
[20:00:31] <BillCriswell> LoneStar99: http://jsfiddle.net/y5CcN/3/
[20:00:57] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/y5CcN/4/ little better var names.
[20:03:11] <LoneStar99> BillCriswell: ok great that works ->  my redition did not -> http://jsfiddle.net/pozrdude/y5CcN/5/
[20:03:36] <LoneStar99> thanks!
[20:05:18] * Velveeta drops into the room suddenly, from a black helicopter, which promptly departs.
[20:05:45] <BillCriswell> That was so bad ass.
[20:06:20] <LoneStar99> lol nice
[20:07:13] <k_sze[work]> What's the best way to access the value of a <select> element in a jQuery change event handler?
[20:07:30] <BillCriswell> k_sze[work]: $(this).val()
[20:07:39] <Velveeta> damn, i was about to type that.. almost-jinx
[20:07:58] <Velveeta> that's what i get for taking a bathroom break
[20:07:59] <BillCriswell> You just dropped from a helicopter.
[20:09:10] <Velveeta> i know, but i was holding my pee that entire ride
[20:23:24] <vlaams> i sleep too much
[20:23:37] <vlaams> Anyone have adderal?
[20:51:40] <LoneStar99> what is the difference between -> var $pall = $(this); and var pall = $(this); ??
[20:52:34] <whoback> they're 2 different variable names if I'm not mistaken
[20:52:50] <whoback> $pall and pall
[20:53:20] <LoneStar99> why would I use var $pall instead of var pall ??
[20:53:44] <whoback> if you wanted to differentiate your jquery variables
[20:54:12] <whoback> var $pall = $("#something").more().cool().things()
[20:54:34] <whoback> or you might just perfer variables with $
[20:54:44] <LoneStar99> hmmm...  ok trying to understand
[20:54:58] <whoback> PHP uses $
[20:55:06] <LoneStar99> yeah
[20:55:14] <whoback> that might be more your style
[20:55:23] <LoneStar99> that is why I am tripping lol
[20:56:41] <whoback> lots of different naming conventions for variables
[20:57:16] <LoneStar99> yeah
[20:57:43] <whoback> might wanna read through some style guides
[20:57:45] <whoback> https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+style+guide&oq=javascript+style+guide&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i64j69i60l2.3007j0j4&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8
[20:59:23] <LoneStar99> k thanks
[22:35:39] <EGreg> hey guys
[22:35:51] <EGreg> does the destructor of a plugin have to be named destroy?
[22:35:54] <EGreg> can it be called remove instead?
[22:36:02] <EGreg> how strong is the convention and who relies on it?
[22:37:15] <EGreg> anyone
[23:05:17] <mogaj> I am trying to get value of dropdown select value it works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/jzjzj/ but when i keep the code in project am getting 'null' for select value ... what might be the issue ?
[23:10:13] <mogaj> on change is alerting correct value but when page first opened giving null in my project but works fine here http://jsfiddle.net/ekancepts/jzjzj/ .... what might be the issue?
[23:15:14] <oojacoboo> hey guys, I have some code wrapped in $(function() {}); for obvious reasons in a full ajax app
[23:15:31] <oojacoboo> I'm wanting to have this code run each time the js is called into the DOM
[23:15:40] <oojacoboo> currently it's only firing once
[23:16:16] <oojacoboo> if I remove the anon function it will load - but not with it - I'm guessing it's some sort of caching issue because of the ajax app and the browser thinking that it doesn't need to run that code again
[23:16:40] <oojacoboo> how can I prevent this or require it to fire each time?
[23:48:07] <diverdude> Hello, I am calling an ajax service like this http://paste.ubuntu.com/7549372 and the server function is invoked and executed as expected. A Response 200 OK is returned to the client, but for some reason the success handler is not being invoked. Only the Commplete handler is invoked...(the error handler is also not being invoked) Why is the success handler not invoked when a Response 200 OK is returned?
