[00:03:44] <FilipNortic> jop008: Are you asking if you can use selectors on data-xxx attributes?
[00:04:19] <gutto> hi, is there a way to tell the trigger of ajaxSend(global) event?
[00:07:04] <FilipNortic> gutto: Tell the trigger what?, or do you mean if it triggered?
[00:07:20] <AdamPDotty> if it is listening to you
[00:07:25] <gutto> nah I mean to get the element that triggered the event
[00:07:39] <gutto> if there is such an element
[00:07:58] <gutto> if for instance an <a> element triggered it I'd like to know that
[00:09:18] * AdamPDotty has never seen "onajaxsend"
[00:09:22] <m4Aark> anyone know if i can add a dynamic row to table with jquery?
[00:09:34] <AdamPDotty> m4Aark: yes
[00:09:47] <m4Aark> adam my table is in a while loop
[00:09:56] <m4Aark> as in my tbody <tr></tr>
[00:09:59] <ahandy> m4Aark: jsfiddle code
[00:10:04] <AdamPDotty> a ha
[00:10:43] <m4Aark> so when i make changes it make changes in the while loop too
[00:11:38] <FilipNortic> gutto: I think you need the event (that triggered ajaxSend)...
[00:12:00] <gutto> check this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/53fccv4c/
[00:12:07] <gutto> thats what I need
[00:12:44] <gutto> couldn't find the tirgger on that event element tho :(
[00:13:25] <FilipNortic> gutto: event.target?
[00:13:34] <gutto> lemme check
[00:14:30] <gutto> afraid not, it shows the Document
[00:18:17] <AdamPDotty> The XY problem: You want to do X, but don't know how. You think you can solve it using Y, but don't know how to do that either. You ask about Y, which is a strange thing to want to do. Just ask about X.
[00:18:34] <jeffreylevesque> if i nest an '.on' method within another, and create a <div> within the nested method, will the parent '.on()' have scope to remove the <div>?
[00:20:02] <AdamPDotty> jeffreylevesque: I would try to declare a var in the parent scope then set it to the div.
[00:20:20] <AdamPDotty> set iit in the child scope
[00:24:06] <gutto> AdamPDotty: is that me who should ask about X problem?
[00:26:32] <AdamPDotty> yep
[00:28:53] <gutto> Well what I am trying is to get the trigger element of ajaxSend (global event) without a need to use local ajax calls(as they are directly handled by framework I am using) dunno what else I should ask about?
[00:29:18] <gutto> isn't that the X problem ? :>
[00:30:05] <FilipNortic> gutto: if you remove the ajaxSend bit and just say what you need it's an X problem
[00:30:20] <sathish> hgj
[00:34:31] <gutto> not sure if I got right, but I need to get the element that started the ajax call and once the call is completed I'd need to get the target element as well(If there is such an element ofcourse). Is that the X problem ?
[00:35:29] <sprihodko> I have gmaps markers with a content like this <a href="/users/rob-jones">Rob Jones</a>. How can i get this path /users/rob-jones from it?
[00:36:04] <gutto> $('a').attr('href')
[00:36:36] <sprihodko> oh, sorry its not a gmap marker it is gmap infowindow
[00:36:53] <kblin> hi folks
[00:37:05] <gurke_> good morning :)
[00:37:59] <kblin> I've got a bunch of ajax calls, and I want to trigger a function after all of them finished. Currently I'm collecting up the deferreds in an array, but apparently passing an array to $.when() doesn't do what I want
[00:39:15] <sprihodko> gutto: not working(( for example when i console.log infowindow.content it prints me the content but i cant get 'a' or 'href' from it
[00:40:15] <gutto> I don't know too much about that gmap actually but how about infowindow.content.find('a').attr('href') ?
[00:40:54] <gutto> $(infowindow.content).find('a').attr('href') that is ?
[00:43:20] <kblin> ah, $.when.apply(null, mylist).then(stuff) did the trick
[00:45:22] <sprihodko> gutto: $(infowindow.content).attr('href') did the trick
[00:45:36] <gutto> cool :)
[00:45:38] <sprihodko> gutto: muchas gracias )
[00:45:49] <gutto> np man :)
[02:07:34] <borhanuddin_> hi
[02:08:04] <borhanuddin_> just checking Colloquy
[02:10:26] <m4Aark> anyone around to give a helping hand?
[02:16:30] <mooncup> m4Aark: tis better to just ask your question
[02:51:13] <blago> Hi guys . Can you give me a site with jQuery problems to solve. I am a beginer and i want to train to improve my skills. Thank you!
[03:04:00] <gnu_d> Hi, when I set the value of an input text, how come the validator isn't triggering ? - It works well if I type the value manually, using remote, but doesn't work if I set the value from code.
[03:18:21] <Cork> gnu_d: only user actions trigger the field events
[03:19:20] <Cork> gnu_d: so you need to trigger the event directly if you want an event to run after you modify the value
[03:20:19] <Cork> gnu_d: alternatively you can just tell the validation to check the field
[03:24:01] <delboy1978uk> how do i get the text out of a text area?
[03:24:16] <Cork> delboy1978uk: $().val()
[03:24:17] <delboy1978uk> .val() ant .html() dont appear to work
[03:24:28] <delboy1978uk> is it? maybe a typo
[03:24:35] * delboy1978uk checks again
[03:25:19] <delboy1978uk> it was indeed lol
[03:27:40] <gnu_d> Cork: how do I tell the validation to check the field, and if the code is: $('#someform').validate(validationSetup).element("#myelement"); then it's not a solution :(
[03:28:15] <gnu_d> Cork: or what event needs to be triggered ?
[03:29:13] <Cork> gnu_d: $(this).valid() should work
[03:29:35] <Cork> or $('#myelement').valid()
[03:29:38] <gnu_d> Cork: no, it's not working either, it doesn't call the remote validation
[03:30:28] <Latrix> cork if i have a table with tbody in a while loop
[03:30:43] <Latrix> how do i dynamically add rows to the table?
[03:31:15] <gnu_d> Cork: when I type or press enter, the validation triggers, but when I manually run: .valid return false, and the AJAX GET request isn't calling
[03:31:20] <Cork> gnu_d: donno about remote, never used it
[03:31:42] <Cork> gnu_d: you could try trigger('change') on the element
[03:32:09] <gnu_d> Cork: I tried that too, and focus, blur, any event I could think of :(
[03:32:09] <Cork> Latrix: just ask the question, you don't need to direct it to anyone
[03:32:34] <Cork> gnu_d: you would have to dig into the plugin and check what it listens for on remote
[03:32:50] <Cork> Latrix: just append the tr and td
[03:33:18] <gnu_d> Cork: says something about resetForm, but I can't find the resetForm method
[03:34:12] <gnu_d> Cork: yea, it works
[03:39:41] <jop008> is there a good way to handle alert nicely on jquery mobile?
[03:39:58] <jop008> I used simpledialogue but is is outdated
[03:40:13] <Jamie_> Hello, I'm terribly dumb and cant seem to figure out why the second JSON request fails: http://jsfiddle.net/mpqLcz0p/
[03:40:38] <Jamie_> even though http://cms.bmrf.me/?json=get_post&post_id=1 is valid JSOn
[03:40:40] <Jamie_> JSON*
[03:40:56] <Jamie_> if anyone could shed some light on it it would be amazing
[03:41:11] <Cork> Jamie_: cors
[03:41:18] <Latrix> cork i tried doing so i have it working, but its doing for my other while loops too
[03:41:26] <Latrix> possible if i show u what i have right now?
[03:41:33] <Cork> Jamie_: the server doesn't expose it for cross origin requests
[03:41:51] <Cork> Latrix: make a fiddle
[03:42:02] <Latrix> its mostly php codes, i can do that in fiddle?
[03:42:08] <Cork> no
[03:42:31] <Latrix> possible if i share with u on teamviewer?
[03:42:44] <Cork> i'm not interested in the php code
[03:42:55] <Cork> if you need php help your asking in the wrong channel
[03:43:07] <Cork> grab the generated text from the php
[03:43:25] <Cork> if you have a jquery question
[03:43:29] <Cork> php => ##php
[03:44:58] <Jamie_> how would I check if it is CORS? since when I request it with C# it works fine.
[03:45:15] <Jamie_> http://puu.sh/bjvpI/1f0e722818.png
[03:45:17] <Cork> Jamie_: open the browser cosnole
[03:45:18] <Jamie_> as seen in this
[03:45:20] <Cork> *console
[03:45:35] <Cork> "Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://cms.bmrf.me/?json=get_post&post_id=1. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS."
[03:46:29] <Jamie_> k thanks
[03:46:33] <Jamie_> now to figure out how to enable CORS
[03:47:00] <Cork> Jamie_: do you control cms.bmrf.me ?
[03:47:08] <Jamie_> yes
[03:47:17] <Latrix> cork here u go
[03:47:18] <Latrix> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=ksmOo7JK1P
[03:47:45] <Cork> then the server needs to send a header with the get response stating what domains are allowed to access the content
[03:47:49] <Cork> ?g mdn cors
[03:47:55] <b-ot> Cork: HTTP access control (CORS) - HTTP | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[03:48:48] <Cork> Jamie_: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS#The_HTTP_response_headers
[03:48:58] <Jamie_> thanks for the help
[03:49:09] <Cork> Latrix: you need to click save
[03:49:19] <Cork> and send the new url
[03:49:25] <Latrix> http://jsfiddle.net/d4wht75t/
[03:49:40] <Latrix> the button i did has an id in a while loop
[03:49:56] <Latrix> so how do i get it in ajax to append to the correct <tbody>
[03:50:25] <Cork> Latrix: you don't store the value from you get back from $get_lastID();
[03:50:45] <Cork> also there is no ajax call in here
[03:53:13] <Jamie_> have a nice day guys, and again thanks for the help!

[04:11:29] <rudeboy> Can anyone tell me how to disable the submit button until the dropdowns have populated with this little basket of code? http://paste.ofcode.org/A4rW7xrvijg6LFWuCR7Xyu
[04:16:39] <Cork> rudeboy:  (function ($) {})(jQuery); you can combine this with the .ready call
[04:16:55] <Cork> jQuery(document).ready(function($) { }); will make sure $ is jQuery
[04:17:00] <Cork> so no need for the extra wrapper
[04:17:45] <rudeboy> Cork, This?  (function ($) {
[04:17:48] <Cork> yes
[04:17:57] <Cork> and the })(jQuery); at the end
[04:18:29] <Cork> rudeboy: $('.submit-button').prop('disabled', true); should disable the button
[04:18:39] <Cork> rudeboy: don't EVER do $('.submit-button').attr('disabled','disabled');
[04:19:01] <Cork> opps wrong direction
[04:19:22] <Cork> also do $('.submit-button').prop('disabled', false); instead of removeAttr('disabled')
[04:19:57] <Cork> assuming .submit-button is <input type="submit"> or <button></button>
[04:21:32] <rudeboy> Cork, I broke it, drats. I'm missing something: http://paste.ofcode.org/FBP4cBSVTEWGADJmVhwuCh
[04:21:53] <Cork> rudeboy: ya the $ in the ready call
[04:22:58] <rudeboy> Cork, Sorry, wrong one: http://paste.ofcode.org/dkTdgAgbKSJKvX8KjYQG5Y
[04:23:07] <rudeboy> I have the $ there, but it's still not working
[04:24:32] <Cork> rudeboy: hmm strange, that should work
[04:25:16] <rudeboy> Cork, Now it is after a hard refresh (if that's what you call it)
[04:25:33] <rudeboy> Cork, Why do you advise against  $('.submit-button').attr('disabled','disabled'); ?
[04:28:56] <rudeboy> Cork, $('.submit-button').prop('disabled', true); is working well, thanks so much :)
[04:46:17] <jop008> I use jquery dialog creating this http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-09-03_at_13.44.53-cML0lS7Z.png looks horrible

[04:50:54] <Uhkis_> #css
[05:14:10] <Cork> rudeboy: to answer your attr question
[05:14:22] <Cork> rudeboy: attr is for modifying attributes
[05:14:38] <Cork> rudeboy: it doesn't work (cross browsers) to modify element state
[05:14:46] <Cork> like disabled, checked and so on

[05:27:49] <lgp171188> Hi, I have a javascript click handler written using jquery like this - http://dpaste.com/061GCGM. This basically adds a form dynamically to the page on clicking a button. But instead of adding 1 button, it adds 2 at a time. So what could be the issue here?
[05:28:27] <lgp171188> *adding 1 form, it adds 2 at a time
[05:28:52] <lgp171188> In case it helps, my form contains 2 input elements.
[05:36:54] <AdamPDotty> Where is the markup to that?

[06:24:07] <BillCriswell> ben99: You need to be WAAAAAYYYYYYY more specific than that.
[06:24:39] <ben99> is it jQuery UI? are there finished components like that? is it all hand coded?
[06:26:07] <BillCriswell> It doesn't look like they're using jQuery UI.
[06:27:40] <BillCriswell> It looks like it's just using some bootstrap components?
[06:27:59] <BillCriswell> A few other plugins.
[06:28:41] <BillCriswell> There is so much going on here haha.
[06:29:08] <BillCriswell> I feel like I'm piloting an airplane or something.
[06:33:22] <sacho> it's not all hand coded.

[06:46:00] <workspot> invite
[06:46:20] <pdcmoreira> just register your nickname
[06:46:22] <stalin_mario> or does $(this) always resolve to the jquery object returned from the jquery function and the this keyword is handled in a different context ?
[06:46:23] <pdcmoreira> and identify
[06:47:01] <pdcmoreira> stalin_mario: $(this) changes when scope/callback changes
[06:47:19] <workspot> I am logged in from home with my reg nick, unfortunately. At office now. Can't VPN, as it's an Amiga back home. There's a Ghost command that works right, to kill other?
[06:47:44] <stalin_mario> pdcmoreira: ok sure, what I don't get are the scope rules in this case
[06:48:37] <pdcmoreira> just save the $(this) to a var
[06:49:12] <stalin_mario> I would have guess this would refer to the object and since that could't possibly be a jquery object is would fail
[06:50:02] <stalin_mario> pdcmoreira: yes that would work but I am trying to understand how come my failure to refactored that part still yielded something that works
[06:50:11] <stalin_mario> *refactor
[06:51:13] <stalin_mario> I the fact that I guessed it would fail and it works demonstrates a severe lack of knowledge on my behalf
[06:51:29] <stalin_mario> s/I///
[06:51:41] <pdcmoreira> im not a pro in jquery either
[06:51:46] <pdcmoreira> so i usually play it safe

[07:13:11] <BillCriswell> It looks right.
[07:13:28] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Nope. I'm quite baffled
[07:14:55] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: http://jsbin.com/qolodiyovawu/1/edit?html,js,output it's working here. Maybe something in your CSS is throwing it off?

[07:16:46] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: Just isolate it less and less till it works. (I think that makes sense).

[07:17:11] <DeltaHeavy> Might just drop this issue till later.

[07:30:17] <BillCriswell> stalin_mario: .sel
[07:30:30] <BillCriswell> Well, the element it's currently iterating through.

[07:32:00] <BillCriswell> Blah, the element that's handling the click event*.
[07:32:06] <BillCriswell> I need a nap.
[07:32:22] <Daniel0> decx got it working, makes sense now :)
[07:32:33] <BillCriswell> stalin_mario: http://jsbin.com/vodiyoximiko/2/edit?js,output
[07:34:18] <stalin_mario> thx BillCriswell  :) why does it behave like so ? shouldn't this resolve to the instance of foo ?
[07:35:33] <sacho> javascript doesn't have methods.
[07:36:05] <sacho> assigning a function to some object's property doesn't do anything special. The value of `this` is determined by the way you call the function.
[07:36:31] <BillCriswell> YEs, what sacho said.
[07:37:41] <stalin_mario> thx sacho :)

[08:16:06] <buzzedword> hey guys. doing a crazy round of refactoring right now and i'm stuck on something stupid that i was hoping you can help with
[08:16:15] <buzzedword> i have a delegated click handler that looks like this: https://gist.github.com/buzzedword/c05c8c4a7c3f81bbed55
[08:16:54] <buzzedword> i feel its convoluted, and there's so many more across the legacy app like this. is there an alternative syntax i can use to simplify this more? unfortunately, all the selectors are necessary
[08:17:03] <buzzedword> haven't touched HTML refactoring yet
[08:20:22] <sacho> what exactly do you expect to simplify, if not the selector?
[08:21:56] <buzzedword> realizing how vague that sounds. so, for example, if this were not a delegate selector but a normal one, i might isolate the parent in a selector, cache it, then find() everything else
[08:22:09] <buzzedword> is there a similar pattern that can be used for delegate selectors?
[08:22:15] <buzzedword> im not particularly aware of any
[08:23:49] <sacho> Well, you don't have to place it on the document - you could localize it more.

[08:27:25] <buzzedword> sacho: dont know why that didn't occur before. thank you-- going to look into that. i think that definitely works.
[08:29:23] <buzzedword> stef1a: where are you loading your script files, and are you guarding your methods with $(document).ready ?
[08:29:41] <buzzedword> stef1a: I generally put my script files at the very bottom of the page before </body>
[08:30:09] <stef1a> buzzedword: i'm using the rails asset pipeline, and each of my js files starts with $(document).ready(function(event){
[08:31:58] <stef1a> also, i'm using jquery, not jquery 2, i believe
[08:32:22] <buzzedword> can you verify where rails drops the jquery files in relation to your source?
[08:32:38] <buzzedword> im not saying this is the issue, but i ran into something once where it had dropped my source before jquery
[08:32:47] <buzzedword> then corrected it on cache refresh
[08:33:45] <buzzedword> chrome shrugs that off without an issue, but it bombs firefox and IE when that happens
[08:34:32] <bdonnhue> hey guys. I need to save a state between function calls
[08:34:37] <stef1a> buzzedword: i'll ask the #rubyonrails people, as i'm a bit shaky with the asset pipeline. thanks!
[08:34:39] <bdonnhue> i am using a hidden input to do this
[08:34:44] <bdonnhue> is there a better way?
[08:35:29] <buzzedword> stef1a: yeah, no problem. the last ditch i'd say if that doesn't work is switch $(document).ready for $(window).load. its not my favorite solution, but i've had to hack that in with rails specifically, too
[08:36:05] <buzzedword> i'd say avoid that if at all possible
[08:36:13] <stef1a> buzzedword: thanks, i'll keep that in my pocket in case i get desperate :-)
[08:42:00] <thaifood> hi, is there a way to put the same class on two drop downs and listen for a change in the drop down ?
[08:43:08] <thaifood> if either of two drop downs change i want to fire off come code
[08:44:01] <thaifood> do i just need to use a listener for each by id and then call a common external function ?
[08:45:22] <BillCriswell> thaifood: Would make more sense to use a class and just do $('.some-select').on('change', function () { /* this is the element that was changed */ });
[08:45:23] <BillCriswell> BRB
[08:49:08] <thaifood> BillCriswell: works great, thx !
[08:49:25] <adavia> how can i avoid repeated messages in this fiddle when i click send http://jsfiddle.net/v6g7urpc/
[08:50:38] <robertmaxrees> adavia check if the div exists, have a stateful bit that you set when you add it and check that.
[08:50:41] <robertmaxrees> lots of different ways.
[08:50:52] <robertmaxrees> also: don't do form#comments - just do the ID
[08:53:23] <adavia> robertmaxrees: if i remove it before inserting it would work?
[08:53:47] <robertmaxrees> sure, though that seems kind of silly.
[08:54:04] <adavia> why
[08:54:15] <robertmaxrees> why remove it to add it back in?
[08:54:17] <Rerespek> afternoon all (or near to it)
[08:54:23] <robertmaxrees> or morning :)
[08:54:50] <robertmaxrees> adavia http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v6g7urpc/2/
[08:54:53] <robertmaxrees> do something like this.
[08:55:04] <Rerespek> :)
[08:55:24] <decx> or just save data on the forkm
[08:55:53] <adavia> robertmaxrees:  what does lenght do in this case?
[08:56:14] <decx> looks if there are any selectors like that on the page
[08:56:22] <decx> elements*
[08:56:56] <adavia> ohh
[08:57:04] <adavia> make sense
[08:57:13] <robertmaxrees> generally you want to avoid removing/adding things to the document :)
[08:58:07] <Rerespek> question, has anyone run into the annoying .on(click,   only working once? There are some threads on it, but it's stumping me nonetheless
[08:58:23] <robertmaxrees> Rerespek depends on what exactly you're doing.
[08:58:24] <winterpk> Hi all.  I have a problem with anchor links within a jquery tabbed element. For some reason safari won't open the anchors with target="_blank" inside the tab windows.  Has anyone experienced this behavior?
[08:59:38] <Rerespek> it's essentialy this or that. two panels, both with buttons. onclick I addClass(animated fadeOut), then remove fadeOut, and addClass(bounceIn)
[08:59:49] <Rerespek> the animation works nicely, but only once
[08:59:54] <robertmaxrees> Rerespek can you make a fiddle showing us?
[09:00:05] <Rerespek> I can :)
[09:02:26] <Rerespek> using bootstrap in fiddle?
[09:02:48] <adavia> robertmaxrees:  sorry one las question.. whats the difference on what you did with this http://jsfiddle.net/v6g7urpc/4/?
[09:03:54] <Rerespek> robertmaxrees: I think I've closed in on it, though it refreshes the page now.. not crazy about that
[09:04:06] <Rerespek> robertmaxrees: are you familiar with rubber ducky phenomenon?
[09:05:24] <decx> adavia stacked classes dont work like that it's like in css .alert.alert-danger

[09:15:43] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[09:21:22] <Rerespek> robertmaxrees: this is an ugggly fiddle, but it's in progress, drag the middle bar far to the left if you're on a smaller screen like me http://jsfiddle.net/ot1y4aa2/1/
[09:22:16] <RhinoBoss> I have a .trigger('click') which works ok for a time, but then stops working at consistently the same point. I have simulated the code in the console and it works ok there, but when actually called from the code it stops working. Are there any known conflicts with .trigger?
[09:22:48] <robertmaxrees> Rerespek how do I replicate your particular problem?
[09:23:28] <Rerespek> fair question.
[09:24:38] <Rerespek> Well, allow me to keep hacking on it, to get the problem to occur. essentially I'll try to get the animations to trigger, fading the two panels out, then bouncing them back in. the problem lies within the second and further attempts at clicking, which don't trigger the behaviour again
[09:25:38] <robertmaxrees> Rerespek you're aware that you have mulitple periods before some methods, right?
[09:27:07] <Rerespek> I wasn't, probably a copy/paste issue
[09:28:09] <Guest83398> Pls help....Recommended jQuery interview questions and answers sites??
[09:28:45] <robertmaxrees> Guest83398 are you looking to hire somebody who knows jquery?
[09:29:09] <Guest83398> no am preparing for ui developer position
[09:29:23] <robertmaxrees> Guest83398 then that won't help you much :)
[09:29:47] <igcewieling> I'm a bit confused.  I've narrowed the code down to an issue with the scroll event.  This does not appear to work, anyideas on what I'm doing wrong?   $('body').on('scroll', function() { console.log('i scrolled!');  });
[09:30:13] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling try attaching that handler to the window instead maybe?
[09:30:44] <robertmaxrees> Guest83398 how much experience do you have?  also, could you setup a nickname?
[09:30:58] <Guest83398> <lazzle> - ur link was helpful but questions with answers would be much helpful
[09:31:04] <RhinoBoss> Are there any gotchas with using .trigger("click")? Mine just stops responding at a repeatable point, but everything checks out
[09:31:09] <robertmaxrees> RhinoBoss nope.
[09:31:11] <robertmaxrees> no gotchas.
[09:31:22] <robertmaxrees> as long as the listener is bound with jquery, you're good to go.
[09:31:25] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: I can try that.  The code is from a plugin I'm trying to replicate.
[09:32:06] <igcewieling> would that be something like $('window').on('scroll', function() .... ?
[09:32:26] <robertmaxrees> $(window).on('scroll'
[09:32:31] <Rerespek> robertmaxrees: I'm not getting the animations to run in the fiddle
[09:33:04] <robertmaxrees> Rerespek it's real hard to help, but a few things to consider - are you binding listeners inside of other functions?
[09:33:26] <san23> am a 4 yrs exp front end developer..
[09:33:57] <robertmaxrees> cool?  oh were you the dude asking for interview questions from before?
[09:34:11] <san23> right!
[09:34:12] <igcewieling> $(window).on('scroll'... doesn't appear to run the console.log when scrolling, neither does $('*').on('scroll'...   I must have a fundamental misunderstanding of something.
[09:35:10] <BillCriswell> igcewieling: That should work.

[09:36:41] <igcewieling> Ah!  $(window) not $('window')
[09:36:44] <robertmaxrees> woops was scrolled up.
[09:36:50] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling yea... i said that earlier didn't i?
[09:37:13] <robertmaxrees> san23 there's not really going to be any site like that i'm afraid.  you could check out glassdoor and see if anybody has posted up anything about the interview at the place you're going to.

[09:38:06] <manus> Hello, folks! Is there currently any easy way to make a jQuery UI draggable cancel/disregard the beginning of a drag if it's the result of a touch action? Out of the box, it's problematic on touch devices that also support mice (E.g., a windows 8 tabby thingy). Would a $(elt).draggable(...).on('touchstart', function(e){e.preventDefault();}); suffice?
[09:38:11] <BillCriswell> igcewieling: You typed $(window)
[09:38:25] <BillCriswell> Ah doesn't matter.
[09:38:40] <san23> <robertmaxrees> thnaks dude..
[09:39:12] <manus> I basically want to do default scrolling on touch/swipe and only drag with the true mouse
[09:39:17] <robertmaxrees> Rerespek http://fixee.org/paste/2rli78y/
[09:40:48] <Rerespek> robertmaxrees: oh cool tool
[09:42:46] <stef1a> BillCriswell: interestingly, if i just type the address in the address bar to get to the page with jquery, then it works immediately in Firefox. but if i use nav buttons on the site to get to those pages, i need to refresh after landing on them.
[09:42:53] * stef1a strokes chin
[09:43:16] <BillCriswell> stef1a: Say what? haha
[09:43:31] <stef1a> BillCriswell: this is re: the issue i described to you like 45 min ago
[09:43:44] <manus> reading the touch spec, it looks like a preventDefault on touchstart of a draggable might work (it will prevent the mousedown event that would signify the start of the drag), though not sure if that would prevent scrolling also
[09:43:53] <BillCriswell> I think I missed that stef1a.
[09:44:04] <stef1a> BillCriswell: nope. it was this issue:
[09:44:10] <stef1a> i'm using rails 4.1.5. my jquery works perfectly in chrome, but in firefox, i have to reload the page to get the jquery to work. does anyone know why this might be? all of my jquery files begin with $(document).ready(function(event){.
[09:44:19] <stef1a> pretty sure you were there
[09:44:47] <stef1a> BillCriswell: never mind. it wasn't you :-) sorry about that
[09:44:48] <BillCriswell> Haha not sure.
[09:44:53] <stef1a> it was buzzlewoo
[09:44:58] <stef1a> no, it was buzzedword
[09:45:07] <stef1a> >_> so many people with nicks starting with 'b'
[09:45:09] <BillCriswell> stef1a: However, $(document).read(function(event){ }); I believe is very wrong.
[09:45:22] <BillCriswell> ready*
[09:45:26] <manus> Need to run afk for now, but if anyone has an idea about my draggable problem, I'll be checking logs later. Thanks in advance!
[09:45:26] <robertmaxrees> that's actually legit.
[09:45:40] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: With the name event?
[09:45:42] <buzzedword> hiya! I'm a B name!
[09:45:44] <robertmaxrees> it's a shortcut for $(document).on('ready', function(event) {});
[09:46:05] <robertmaxrees> since ready is an event.
[09:46:12] <robertmaxrees> kind of strange to pass the event object in.
[09:46:14] <stef1a> legit :-D
[09:46:16] <BillCriswell> Never even thought of looking at the ready event's event.
[09:46:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah it's kind of unnecessary.
[09:46:31] <BillCriswell> I thought it would assign event to jQuery
[09:46:32] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: i need to pass the event object in to get it to work in firefox :/
[09:46:36] <robertmaxrees> why?
[09:46:41] <buzzedword> what? that was the solution?
[09:46:44] <buzzedword> no way
[09:46:46] <stef1a> buzzedword: no
[09:46:49] <stef1a> buzzedword: no no no.
[09:46:52] <robertmaxrees> stef1a why would you do that?
[09:46:59] <buzzedword> please explain, i'm curious
[09:47:03] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: to make my jquery work in firefox
[09:47:09] <stef1a> buzzedword: the problem of refreshing still persists
[09:47:15] <BillCriswell> jQuery(document).ready(function($){ Isn't this a way to noConflict $? });
[09:47:15] <robertmaxrees> stef1a you... shouldn't need to.
[09:47:21] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: i do
[09:47:27] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell oh wait...
[09:47:29] <robertmaxrees> you're right.
[09:47:31] <robertmaxrees> stef1a why?
[09:47:35] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: i don't know
[09:47:50] <robertmaxrees> heh, could you share your code then?
[09:48:06] <robertmaxrees> just doing things like that without understanding the implications can be dangerous.
[09:48:09] <BillCriswell> Doesn't firefox or chrome automatically have an event object?
[09:48:15] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: absolutely. it's here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25648944/jquery-works-immediately-in-chrome-but-requires-page-refresh-in-firefox
[09:48:32] <lazzle> san23: you could use the questions to learn the answers...
[09:49:00] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell i was wrong, ready isn't a shortcut for on!
[09:49:05] <stef1a> buzzedword: interestingly, if i type the address out in the address bar to visit a jquery page, the jquery runs immediately in ff. but if i use nav buttons on the site to land on them, then i need to refresh after landing to get the ff jquery to work
[09:49:26] <robertmaxrees> per http://api.jquery.com/ready/, the arg it passes to the callback is the handler.
[09:49:34] <BillCriswell> stef1a: Try changing $(document).ready(function(event){ to $(document).ready(function(){
[09:49:48] <BillCriswell> SHot in the dark cause I'm too lazy to really look right now.
[09:49:48] <stef1a> BillCriswell: then the code will stop working in firefox
[09:50:14] <BillCriswell> stef1a: That doesn't sound true.
[09:50:28] <robertmaxrees> stef1a yeah that sounds off.
[09:50:43] <robertmaxrees> the event object isn't used anywhere.
[09:51:52] <BillCriswell> stef1a: http://jsbin.com/cunujelamopi/1/edit?html,js,output
[09:52:31] <robertmaxrees> stef1a does this site use a lot of ajax?
[09:53:01] <maxvi> which lib based on jquery is the best to create simple 2d game?
[09:53:13] <BillCriswell> stef1a: Look at what I posted in Chrome and Firefox. Chrome creates that event for you, Firefox doesn't. I think passing event is ready is messing up a bunch of shit.
[09:53:38] <robertmaxrees> stef1a also, if you're loading things in after the page has loaded, a lot of your code won't work.
[09:54:39] <Rerespek_> woops, computer died
[09:54:44] <Rerespek_> robertmaxrees: sorry about that
[09:55:39] <robertmaxrees> Rerespek_ nbd.
[09:55:56] <Rerespek_> you mentioned that it's inherently flawed??
[09:56:10] <robertmaxrees> Rerespek_ i said the code you shared was invalid.
[09:56:37] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: no
[09:57:01] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: i also don't think i am
[09:57:37] <robertmaxrees> stef1a if it doesn't work when you click to navigate, but it DOES work when you hit the link directly, that tells me you're putting things into the page using ajax or some other dynamic method
[09:57:54] <stef1a> not ajax
[09:58:05] <robertmaxrees> but otherwise dynamic?
[09:58:13] <stef1a> yes
[09:58:18] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[09:58:19] <stef1a> in some places on some pages
[09:58:29] <robertmaxrees> document ready doesn't work for things you're adding later on in page interaction.
[09:59:19] <stef1a> why doesn't chrome seem to care?
[09:59:31] <Rerespek_> robertmaxrees: when you say invalid, you mean not helpful, or...
[09:59:33] <robertmaxrees> it's probably incorrectly throwing the ready event around.
[09:59:46] <robertmaxrees> Rerespek_ i mean the code you supplied was improperly formatted per how you write javascript.
[09:59:58] <robertmaxrees> you had incorrect closing curlies and parens
[10:00:37] <Rerespek_> ok. I'll inspect it. thank you
[10:01:09] <buzzlewoo> what was me?
[10:01:38] <robertmaxrees> Rerespek_ i fixed it in that fixee for you.
[10:01:45] <Rerespek_> oh!
[10:01:49] <robertmaxrees> stef1a chrome tends to not necessarily follow spec.
[10:02:34] <stef1a> buzzlewoo: never mind
[10:07:21] <in_deep_thought> if I want to make an ajax request to my api page to DELETE an object, what would the ajax method type be? I have heard that DELETE is depreciated
[10:07:45] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax();
[10:07:46] <robertmaxrees> ?
[10:08:09] <robertmaxrees> you can specify the method in there.
[10:09:06] <in_deep_thought> robertmaxrees: but what are the method options? is there a DELETE option
[10:09:21] <robertmaxrees> did you read the docs to see?
[10:10:27] <systemfault> in_deep_thought: lol, it's in no way deprecated.
[10:10:44] <robertmaxrees> not all browsers support DELETE, but it's deffo not deprecated.
[10:10:58] <systemfault> All browsers support delete via XHR.
[10:11:06] <robertmaxrees> not per the docs :)
[10:11:15] <systemfault> Which is?
[10:11:38] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ - The type of request to make ("POST" or "GET"), default is "GET". Note: Other HTTP request methods, such as PUT and DELETE, can also be used here, but they are not supported by all browsers.
[10:12:39] <robertmaxrees> it'd be hard to find a browser these days that doesn't support it i'd imagine, but it's good to keep in mind.
[10:13:16] <Rerespek_> robertmaxrees: you just hang out in here?
[10:13:25] <robertmaxrees> Rerespek_ while i work, yeah.
[10:13:50] <Rerespek_> oh nice
[10:13:54] <Rerespek_> you know a lot :)
[10:14:10] <robertmaxrees> i've got some experience ;)
[10:14:39] <Rerespek_> I'm just starting out :) it's exciting
[10:15:37] <robertmaxrees> iawesome.
[10:16:13] <igcewieling> robertmaxree,: BillCriswell: http://jsfiddle.net/58vph5Ld/4/   Seems I simplified it too much.  the issue was with the selector.
[10:16:37] <gringocl> is there a way to remove a named callback from an element, but get a reference to the function that was removed?
[10:17:00] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling yeah you don't want a delegated listener for scroll events.
[10:17:03] <gringocl> like var theCallback = $("selector").off("click.mynamespace");
[10:17:09] <robertmaxrees> and fun fact, the div isn't scrolling in that case :)
[10:17:36] <robertmaxrees> gringocl not that i know of, but you shouldn't need to do a lot of adding/removing listeners.
[10:17:39] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: I don't understand.  the top of the div is off the top of the screen.
[10:17:52] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling right - the window is scrolling to accomodate the div.
[10:18:40] <igcewieling> How do I trigger a function to run when a div scrolls off the top of the window?
[10:18:48] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:19:27] <robertmaxrees> you mean when the top of a div is no longer visible?
[10:19:33] <BillCriswell> igcewieling: The offset top of the div plus its height.
[10:19:47] <igcewieling> I'm trying to replicate something like this https://github.com/polarblau/stickySectionHeaders/blob/master/src/jquery.stickysectionheaders.js like 27
[10:19:59] <igcewieling> ..er.. line 27
[10:20:06] <robertmaxrees> just get the offset of the viewport and compare against the offset of the div.
[10:20:07] <robertmaxrees> bam
[10:20:25] <in_deep_thought> robertmaxrees: but PUT and DELETE seem like they must be such common methods. especially with all of those REST-ful API http methods, right?
[10:20:35] <in_deep_thought> how can they possibly be unsupported?
[10:20:41] <igcewieling> Thanks.  I'll go google to figure what you just said. 8-|
[10:20:42] <robertmaxrees> in_deep_thought you should be safe with most browsers at this point.
[10:20:54] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling check out the offset method :)
[10:24:01] <systemfault> in_deep_thought: It's possible that you find an old browser that doesn't support them, that's what the jQuery doc says.
[10:25:08] <in_deep_thought> robertmaxrees: I am getting “method not allowed” for the specified url errors for my delete method on this url localhost/souveneirs/storage?id=5 . I am using a new version of chrome so I doubt that this is the issue. Are url parameters like these an appropriate url format? or do I need somthing like localhost/souveneirs/storage/5
[10:25:58] <robertmaxrees> is this cross-domain?
[10:26:08] <in_deep_thought> no
[10:26:18] <robertmaxrees> same port, protocol, and domain/subdomain?
[10:26:19] <BillCriswell> igcewieling: http://jsbin.com/cikodivapabo/1/
[10:26:28] <robertmaxrees> because i have no clue then without seeing more.
[10:26:41] <BillCriswell> Er, http://jsbin.com/cikodivapabo/2/edit?js,output
[10:27:46] <in_deep_thought> I am making requests to an api page that I have. so my main page localhost/souveneirs is making an ajax request to localhost/souveneirs/storage which has a big list of json elements and it displays them.
[10:28:34] <igcewieling> robertmaxrees: would I still need to use the off-set method if I only need the event to fire when the *entire* div (or whatever element) scrolls off?
[10:29:25] <robertmaxrees> igcewieling yep.  you want that divs offset().top + its height. that gets you the bottom of the div.
[10:29:35] <robertmaxrees> then compare that to the window's current vertical offset.
[10:29:51] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/cikodivapabo/2/edit?js,output
[10:38:58] <Rerespek> robertmaxrees: ok, so I've got the animations working (with your help) from the fixee you sent, is there an obvious reason click only works once?
[10:39:27] <robertmaxrees> not from what you showed me.
[10:39:48] <robertmaxrees> but i get the feeling that you're getting tripped up by animating queues or you're adding/removing things from the page elsewhere maybe?
[10:46:47] <Rerespek> possibly, it's a bit of a albatross for me right now... is there a best practice for having a on method be repeatable?
[10:46:58] <Rerespek> *an .on method
[10:47:17] <robertmaxrees> by binding it once outside of other functions.
[10:47:22] <robertmaxrees> it shoud "repeat" always.
[10:47:35] <robertmaxrees> if you're adding/removing things, use event delegation instead.
[10:51:31] <rudeboy_> I have two dropdowns, the second dropdown populates based on the selection of the first. However, if a user selects from the first dropdown (or returns from the results page) and then reloads the page, the second dropdown remains disabled. Can anyone show me where I'm going wrong? http://paste.ofcode.org/hgxFcuwpwSTFPVqV2pynCY
[10:52:16] <John3k> hi guys
[10:52:20] <John3k> i know $jQ(window).on('hashchange', function()
[10:52:32] <John3k> is there anything that check something like hashloaded?
[10:52:35] <rudeboy_> I either need to reset the dropdowns on reload, or (preferably) remember the first dropdown choice but then enable the second dropdown
[10:52:46] <John3k> that get called when i load index.php#myhash
[10:53:52] <robertmaxrees> John3k you need to manually check window.location.hash
[10:54:00] <John3k> ok thx
[10:54:02] <robertmaxrees> no event for it.
[10:54:15] <Uhkis> John3k: on first load? you could trigger('hashchange');
[10:54:29] <John3k> yes, sounds good, ty!
[10:54:34] <robertmaxrees> eeeeh...
[10:57:16] <rudeboy_> Did that make sense?
[10:57:47] <robertmaxrees> rudeboy_ a fiddle would be helpful.
[10:58:42] <rudeboy_> robertmaxrees, I'm not sure how to setup a fiddle for something like that because it's all called dynamically
[10:59:45] <robertmaxrees> you have to store state somewhere and check on pageload what that state is.
[11:00:52] <rudeboy_> robertmaxrees, Something like "If <dropdown> is not <blank>, then fire the function"?
[11:01:07] <robertmaxrees> sure
[11:01:29] <robertmaxrees> i'd check the .val() of that dropdown, but you get the idea.
[11:01:42] <rudeboy_> robertmaxrees, val is value right?
[11:02:18] <robertmaxrees> .val() retrieves the value of a form control, yes
[11:03:53] <rudeboy_> robertmaxrees, if (('select[name="post_type"]').val()) == er.......something along the lines of that?
[11:05:33] <rudeboy_> robertmaxrees, Or am I way off the mark?
[11:06:44] <robertmaxrees> if ($('select').val() !== '') {}
[11:06:54] <robertmaxrees> also try to give it a class or ID to select on instead of the name attribute.
[11:07:19] <hooligan321> hey I am not 100% what type of issue this is but I tested my website on browser stack and most of the androids return a white screen.. any idea whats the problem ? .. im kind of thinking they might be throwing a script error preventing the completing of window.load and then not applying the css to via .show() to make the contanier elements on the page visible
[11:07:22] <hooligan321> to complicate things more .. there seems to be a firmware radio related issue on some andriods that could cause a white screen when loading pages
[11:07:43] <rudeboy_> robertmaxrees, Ok thanks so much, I'll give that a try
[11:11:13] <Rerespek> what's the best way to add something like "random="arbitrary code"" to an element?
[11:11:21] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[11:11:23] <robertmaxrees> random=?
[11:11:25] <decx> you don't
[11:11:31] <decx> data-* or bust
[11:11:41] <robertmaxrees> you cannot add random attributes, if that's what you mean.
[11:12:07] <decx> apparently you can if you make a frontend library
[11:12:10] <Rerespek> ie it changes <div></div>,  to <div random="arbitrary code">  </div>
[11:12:28] <robertmaxrees> you "can", but that's not valid.
[11:12:32] <robertmaxrees> nor is it a good idea.
[11:12:37] <robertmaxrees> use data-* attributes instead.
[11:12:40] <robertmaxrees> or jquery's .data() method.
[11:12:42] <Rerespek> ok
[11:12:51] <robertmaxrees> what sort of "arbitrary code"?
[11:13:54] <Rerespek> yep, adding data-* attributes works just fine! Thanks!
[11:14:11] <robertmaxrees> you can use .data() to read/write those btw.
[11:14:58] <Rerespek> nice
[11:18:19] <decx> read, not write
[11:18:33] <robertmaxrees> well.
[11:18:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[11:18:47] <robertmaxrees> write to the cached version, which is really what you want.
[11:30:03] <djzn> how do I allow a "required" field done with Validation plugin to accept starting spaces?
[11:42:18] <w00tb3ast> Question: can I do an ajax() upload of a file in IE8?
[11:49:21] <hooligan321> just curious would multiple .load functions give mobile browsers a hard time?
[12:09:04] <Barcode_> Hey guys! Can anyone check this question out? Ive been googling for ages, and it seems kinda impossible: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25650802/how-to-create-a-smooth-time-bar-but-add-seconds-in-between
[12:09:28] <robertmaxrees> can you create a fiddle?
[12:17:39] <Jattenalle> Barcode_, you can't create a smooth "time bar" if you use %'s
[12:17:46] <Jattenalle> since 1% is oftentimes more than 1 pixel on the screen
[12:17:50] <Jattenalle> which makes it "jump"
[12:18:11] <Jattenalle> also, you only need to update the timebar whenever the new value is different from the old value
[12:18:26] <Jattenalle> ie: 10% is the same as 10.05%
[12:18:35] <Jattenalle> (visually, on the screen, the same that is)
[12:19:05] <Jattenalle> Barcode_, other than that, it's a very vague question, that depends on a lot of factors.. is it a UI problem? is it a code problem? etc
[12:36:02] <Barcode_> Jattenalle, is there a way to achieve this?
[12:48:58] <edrahn> how do I cancel a jquery UI event?
[12:49:11] <edrahn> preventDefault() isn't working
[12:50:08] <jax> hello
[12:50:56] <jax> if i do something like var link = $("<a />", { href: url, text: item.number } how can i then append this link like $("table.properties").append("<td>" + link + "</td>");
[12:51:03] <jax> without it appearing as [object Object]
[12:51:18] <robertmaxrees> jax you can't concat the object with strings.
[12:51:27] <jax> .html() maybe?
[12:51:30] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:51:41] <robertmaxrees> your issue is that you're concating strings to objects.
[12:52:07] <jax> what would make sense?
[12:52:11] <robertmaxrees> var $myTd = $('<td/>'); $myTd.append(link); $('.properties').append($myTd);
[12:52:14] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[12:52:19] <jax> ah keep it objects
[12:52:32] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[12:52:41] <robertmaxrees> "<td>" + link + "</td>" coerces link to a string
[12:53:34] <jax> is there no way to get the string of a jquery object then?
[12:53:44] <jax> because i'm actually adding quite a bit of elements in there
[12:53:50] <jax> i just cut them out for simplicity sake
[12:53:57] <robertmaxrees> you can, but that's a really awkward idea.
[12:54:06] <robertmaxrees> manipulate objects, not strings.
[12:56:54] <jax> how can i add a list of jquery objects
[12:56:57] <jax> i got a list of links
[12:57:05] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:57:24] <robertmaxrees> var $myStuff = $myOriginalCollection.add('.someSelector')
[12:57:31] <jax> one sec, got code
[12:57:46] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be awesome.
[12:58:04] <jax> https://dpaste.de/E0Xy
[12:58:20] <jax> rather simple,
[12:58:37] <robertmaxrees> btw use === not ==
[12:59:42] <robertmaxrees> also, prepend jquery objects with $ - that lets you know what is and isn't a jquery object pretty easily.
[13:00:01] <jax> the links.join is the problem i think
[13:00:17] <robertmaxrees> what is data.items ?
[13:00:38] <jax> just some json
[13:01:20] <robertmaxrees> hrml.
[13:01:45] <robertmaxrees> this seems odd.
[13:01:56] <robertmaxrees> you're mixing strings and jquery objects - not sure why.
[13:02:24] <jax> i don't want to
[13:02:41] <robertmaxrees> then do everything consistently?
[13:02:58] <jax> trying to
[13:03:42] <robertmaxrees> earlier you're buidling a link using one syntax, later on you're building a TH and a TD using a different syntax.  i'd clean that up a little.
[13:04:06] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch.  bbiab.
[13:09:31] <scri66le> anyone know bootstrap really good?
[13:16:31] <scri66le> any bootstrap experts out there?
[13:17:11] <drej> scri66le ##bootstrap
[13:18:11] <jax> how do i join(", ") an Array of jQuery elements?
[13:18:52] <NoiseEee> jQuery elements?
[13:22:16] <RiskyShenanigan> anyone used the fancybox plugin for images/
[13:22:17] <RiskyShenanigan> ?
[13:24:41] <Cork> jax: you can't really join elements to a string
[13:24:49] <Cork> jax: what exactly are you trying to do?
[13:25:17] <mooncup> well
[13:25:24] <jax> i'm just creating an array of links like $link = $("<a />", { … })
[13:25:24] <mooncup> you could loop through them and append them I guess
[13:25:31] <jax> and now i'm trying to append them to a table cell
[13:25:36] <Cork> ah
[13:26:18] <Cork> jax: var links = []; link.push($('<a...')[0])
[13:26:27] <Cork> jax: and then td.append(links)
[13:26:52] <Cork> jax: if you want commas inbetween the links you would have to create text nodes
[13:27:15] <robertmaxrees> jax fwiw  $link = $("<a />", { … }) is not an array
[13:27:28] <jax> map() creates an array though
[13:27:34] <Cork> robertmaxrees: it is, almost
[13:27:40] <Cork> its an array like object
[13:27:41] <jax> i'm mapping the contents of a json answer as links to an arary
[13:27:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:27:48] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware that it's "array-like".
[13:27:52] <edrahn> http://jsfiddle.net/rdp6x9xz/
[13:28:05] <edrahn> How do I not show the value in the text box?
[13:28:11] <robertmaxrees> just pointing out that it's weird to treat a single item collection as an array.
[13:28:22] <edrahn> According to the documentation I just cancel the event
[13:28:25] <Cork> robertmaxrees: but it is
[13:28:32] <edrahn> but that doesn't seem to be working
[13:28:34] <Cork> robertmaxrees: jquery never use a single item
[13:28:39] <edrahn> unless I'm doing it wrong
[13:28:46] <robertmaxrees> it is a single-item collection >.>
[13:29:00] <robertmaxrees> that is array-like.
[13:29:03] <Cork> robertmaxrees: uh, so you mean an array is a single item array?
[13:29:11] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:29:12] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[13:29:13] <robertmaxrees> whatever
[13:29:14] <Cork> and to handle the array you store the array in an array?
[13:29:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:29:23] <robertmaxrees> see ya later i guess.
[13:29:28] <Cork> robertmaxrees: you can add items to a jquery collection
[13:29:33] <Cork> just like you can to an array
[13:29:47] <Cork> (not the same command though)
[13:30:36] <Cork> yay for ppl in a rush
[13:30:42] <jax> i think i'll stick non jquery.
[13:30:45] <jax> much simplert
[13:30:46] <Cork> < one min before question to quit...
[13:30:59] <Cork> jax: if you by none jquery mean html strings
[13:31:02] <Cork> sure
[13:31:16] <jax> yeah
[13:31:27] <Cork> though you can create a string and then give it to jquery
[13:32:00] <Cork> but yes if you need arbitrary strings in between the elements
[13:32:06] <Cork> you're better of using strings
[14:04:07] <miznitic> I'm stumbling on this one. Assuming http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/, how do I get the results from the server on .done()?
[14:04:50] <stef1a> i'm using rails 4.1.5. my jquery works perfectly in chrome, but in firefox, i have to reload the page to get the jquery to work. does anyone know why this might be? all of my jquery files begin with $(document).ready(function(event){. i asked this question here, and removing event from that first line does not help; this problem persists even with static content
[14:05:07] <stef1a> s/here/here before/
[14:05:34] <miznitic> assuming I created a server-side app that returns true, or false. How do I capture that return using the .done() handler?
[14:08:15] <Prometheian> I'm looking for a library that will allow me to make a paged list. I found ListJS but it doesn't seem to have a # per page option. Anyone know of a library that will do what I'm looking to do?
[14:09:24] <snover> dgrid
[14:09:56] <Prometheian> That looks.. rather intensive.
[14:12:47] <miznitic> deferred.done() is the biggest pile of excessive complication ever.
[14:12:55] <miznitic> (the documentation page, I mean)
[14:17:02] <shoky> miznitic: $.get(...).done(function(data) { ... })     data would be the response data.  the type of data depends on the response content-type, or the dataType you pass to $.get or $.ajax
[15:17:16] <uskerine> hi guys, I am using this to retrieve a PDF
[15:17:23] <uskerine> http://pastebin.com/ReAM2mDA
[15:17:32] <uskerine> it does not work, as there is no popup to OPEN or SAVE the PDF
[15:17:50] <uskerine> if I type directly the URL it works fine (so server-side part seems to be ok, plus all headers are in place -checked in #java-)
[15:18:09] <uskerine> does anyone know why ?
[15:43:06] <uskerine> which is the proper way of calling a web service that returns a PDF but display a clock while the web service delivers it (it has to generate it and it takes few seconds)
[15:43:10] <djzn> is there any example on how to make a validation script to put to work the "required" tag (not leave empty) but also to allow spaces ("required" doesn't allow starting spaces)?
[15:44:01] <uskerine> by display a clock i mean do something neat like for example a message "downloading" or change the pointer into a sandclock or whatever
[16:55:00] <nezZario> Ok, if I have an .on('blur', ...) .. I also need to trigger this code once when the page runs, what is the most /appropriate/ way ?
[16:55:41] <robertmaxrees> 2 options: abstract the function out and reference it in the handler as well as run it on pageload.
[16:55:48] <robertmaxrees> or trigger the blur event on the thing.
[16:56:58] <nezZario> k, that's what I thought -- was making sure there wasn't something more obvious I was missing.  thanks.
[16:57:40] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest the first one, btrw.
[16:57:42] <robertmaxrees> *btw
[17:32:37] <jaccob> I am experience wierd behaviour with focusin and focusout, please see http://jsfiddle.net/ogevsa4w/
[17:33:19] <robertmaxrees> what's the weird behavior?
[17:33:39] <jaccob> robertmaxrees, it is working on the input not the div
[17:34:09] <jaccob> robertmaxrees, if I click in the div, focusin doesn't fire, only if I click inside the input does it fire. And same applies for focus out
[17:34:31] <jaccob> robertmaxrees, if I click inside the div but outside the input, it still fires focusout
[17:34:45] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:36:12] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.
[17:36:20] <robertmaxrees> focus events only work on a select set of elements.
[17:37:13] <jaccob> robertmaxrees, ah, maybe I should do something with onlick
[17:37:32] <robertmaxrees> what exactly are you trrying to accomplish?
[17:37:46] <jaccob> robertmaxrees, the searchbar like github
[17:38:08] <robertmaxrees> the styling?
[17:38:40] <jaccob> robertmaxrees, so when focusin happens, I just increase the width, and decrease back when focusout happens, which is great, except I don't want to decrease back when the Go span is pressed
[17:39:15] <robertmaxrees> I was about to ask why you didn't just use the css :focus psuedo
[17:43:09] <_r0m3> i was reading more about the "progressive enhancement" strategy -- how do you guys feel about a site that relies so much on js that they have to deny access to users who have it disabled?
[17:43:27] <robertmaxrees> entirely depends.
[17:44:13] <jaccob> _r0m3, old news dude, non js days are long gone
[17:44:22] <_r0m3> i'm in that boat now :/ -- having to redirect users to a message.
[17:44:33] <robertmaxrees> jaccob tell my customers, then.
[17:44:43] <robertmaxrees> we have to support all the way down to slow-ass connections on IE8
[17:44:46] <_r0m3> meaning what exactly, jaccob? that the percentage of non-js is too neglible to worry about?
[17:44:50] <jaccob> robertmaxrees, name a single website that doesn't have js
[17:45:13] <robertmaxrees> jaccob it's not about not having JS - it's about still supporting users when it fails.
[17:45:15] <jaccob> _r0m3, that people who disable js are not browsing the net, they are looking at an intranet maybe
[17:45:28] <_r0m3> ah, i hear you.
[17:45:32] <jaccob> There isn'
[17:45:49] <robertmaxrees> we try to support users who, for whatever reason, can't get the JS assets to run, so they can at least purchase things on our site.
[17:45:56] <jaccob> There isn't much to do really, browser degrade fairly gracefully on their own. The js feature just wont work
[17:46:12] <robertmaxrees> depends entirely on how your site is built ;)
[17:46:39] <robertmaxrees> i've seen plenty of people build mission critical functionality and have it rely on something JS running.
[17:46:48] <jaccob> robertmaxrees, yeah true, if you want to offer ajax for js users and post to pages for non js people
[17:47:13] <robertmaxrees> aye.  tons of small things you can dop.
[17:47:23] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer graceful degredation these days.
[17:47:34] <_r0m3> aside from it being outright disabled or unsupported, are there any other reason(s) that a script might fail for a user?
[17:47:34] <robertmaxrees> same concept, different mindset.
[17:47:42] <_r0m3> actually, that's probably a dumb question :(
[17:47:47] <robertmaxrees> _r0m3 not at all dumb.
[17:47:50] <_r0m3> i'm just new.
[17:48:12] <robertmaxrees> adblock can really break shit if you're not paying attention.
[17:48:34] <_r0m3> is there any way i can anticipate or detect something like that?
[17:48:35] <robertmaxrees> users on slow connections might not get all of your assets.
[17:48:36] <jaccob> _r0m3, there are tons of js program out there constantly crashing, probably be worse in future as js power increases. I've been to sites that crash my system
[17:48:38] <arschmitz> external dependencies can get you often too cdn down etc
[17:48:53] <robertmaxrees> ^ bingo
[17:48:55] <robertmaxrees> (hai arschmitz)
[17:49:03] <arschmitz> robertmaxrees: hey
[17:49:41] <robertmaxrees> all depends on the site imo.  we have a good financial reason to support those scenarios.
[17:49:43] <robertmaxrees> not everybody does.
[17:49:55] <_r0m3> makes sense. just trying to avoid any users seeing my site in ways i don't intend -- i.e. without js, lol
[17:50:02] <arschmitz> robertmaxrees: for sure many single page rich apps its just not practical
[17:50:11] <arschmitz> but an e commerce site its a must for most
[17:50:15] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:50:18] <robertmaxrees> yep yep yep
[17:50:40] <robertmaxrees> hell some folks lock stuff down to only run in say chrome.
[17:50:56] <arschmitz> also depends on geographic location
[17:51:04] <robertmaxrees> yep
[17:51:16] <arschmitz> if you need to support africa for example where feature phones are the primary internet access
[17:51:20] <arschmitz> you better work with no js
[17:51:29] <robertmaxrees> a-hyup
[17:52:30] <arschmitz> on the flip side if your site makes its money on ad revenue it does not matter because ads wont work without js in general
[17:52:53] <arschmitz> never an easy answer...
[17:53:05] <robertmaxrees> this man knows things
[17:53:11] <arschmitz> lol
[17:53:43] <robertmaxrees> also i have to give soem respect because he was given mod like a day or so before i was.
[17:54:03] <arschmitz> robertmaxrees: ha i didnt even really want it
[17:54:12] <arschmitz> i just have mod in every jquery channel
[17:54:17] <robertmaxrees> oh hahaha.
[17:54:37] <robertmaxrees> just because?
[17:54:48] <arschmitz> i work full time on jquery projects
[17:54:58] <robertmaxrees> aaaaaah derp.
[17:54:58] <arschmitz> im the project lead of jquery mobile
[17:55:14] <robertmaxrees> that's right. i forget these things a lot.  you were in here a while ago talking about it.
[17:55:31] <arschmitz> likely im always here just generally not paying attention
[17:56:15] <robertmaxrees> word
[17:56:25] <BillCriswell> Paying attention is overrated.
[17:56:30] <_r0m3> lol
[17:56:42] <robertmaxrees> you're overrated
[17:56:43] <arschmitz> ha yeah this channel can be distracting if im trying to work
[17:57:00] <sammych> work
[17:57:07] <arschmitz> so many questions
[17:57:11] <BillCriswell> haha.
[17:57:14] <sammych> just the perfect timing for me
[17:57:26] <sammych> ars is just the guy I'm looking for, actually
[17:57:30] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: So many of the same questions is what drives me nuts haha.
[17:57:43] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: yup
[17:57:47] <robertmaxrees> i should just make a bunch of fiddles for those.
[17:57:50] <sammych> autocomplete listview with remote data - why does it sometimes hide the results?
[17:58:02] <robertmaxrees> "halp this event doesn't work i'm adding this thing after pageload"
[17:58:05] <robertmaxrees> etc
[17:58:07] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: They must exist 100 times over at this point.
[17:58:12] <arschmitz> sammych: ha ha i need more of a description then that
[17:58:20] <sammych> I'm gonna get to it ;)
[17:58:21] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell i know i never save them under my account though :()
[17:58:42] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Same.
[17:59:00] <arschmitz> need to make a faq with links to fiddles and bins for common questions
[17:59:10] <arschmitz> and then you can keep track of them with it
[17:59:43] <sammych> if I take the same from the demo pages, and put it into my project. the results are all hidden with the class 'ui-screen-hidden'. If I run it on it's own in jsbin, the results show up as expected
[17:59:46] <sammych> sample*
[18:00:19] <arschmitz> sammych: so it works in demos and it works in jsbin but not in your project?
[18:00:45] <sammych> yes, standalone
[18:01:04] <arschmitz> sammych: sounds like an issue with something in your project
[18:01:30] <robertmaxrees> haha
[18:01:34] <sammych> in my project, I put in dummy data (loop from 1-10) and the HTML is just <li>#</li>. that doesn't show up
[18:01:51] <sammych> I changed it to just output <li>asdasd</li> and they show up just fine
[18:02:18] <arschmitz> sammych: honestly with out being able to see the markup and code thats failing i have no idea
[18:02:44] <sammych> the markup is all there, it's just not being hidden by that class
[18:02:53] <sammych> just being hidden*
[18:03:28] <sammych> I'll see what I can whip up
[18:03:35] <arschmitz> ok
[18:04:04] <sammych> btw, I see a demo that uses "$ul"
[18:04:19] <arschmitz> ok
[18:04:34] <arschmitz> we have lots of that still in old code
[18:04:48] <arschmitz> its slowing being removed as the code gets looked at again
[18:04:58] <sammych> yeah, I recognise it from when I was going a project in 1.3
[18:05:05] <sammych> *doing, sigh
[18:05:32] <arschmitz> there was a point where jQuery Mobile was not very good about following the js style guide
[18:06:56] <tester> anybody here familiar with select2 plugin?
[18:06:58] <sammych> I'm just gonna arse around it and just find('X').removeClass('X'), because it seems like all the li's have been enhanced properly
[18:07:23] <arschmitz> sammych: the class is applied based on whatever the current text in the filter is
[18:07:28] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ tester
[18:07:28] <b-ot> tester: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[18:07:30] <sammych> I KNEW IT
[18:07:31] <arschmitz> so it should all be hidden until you type
[18:07:39] <sammych> it's remote data, though
[18:07:46] <sammych> and it's custom html going into it
[18:07:48] <arschmitz> sammych: so?
[18:08:04] <sammych> so, what if the contents have nothing to do with the input?
[18:08:12] <tester> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25655697/select2-optiongroup-display-error
[18:08:25] <sammych> if I type in 1+1, and it gives me 2, will it hide that row?
[18:08:44] <sammych> (as a terrible contrived example)
[18:09:03] <arschmitz> sammych: the autocomplete example just takes a remote data source and displays the matched results
[18:09:21] <sammych> which is what I'm doing
[18:09:22] <arschmitz> sammych: im confused what your trying to do?
[18:09:25] <arschmitz> ok
[18:09:35] <sammych> but it seems to be hiding results on it's own
[18:09:36] <tester> @robertmaxrees i have a problem with grouping the results
[18:09:40] <arschmitz> so everything is hidden until you type something that matches
[18:09:41] <robertmaxrees> tester a fiddle would be cool.
[18:10:02] <arschmitz> sammych: thats how autocompletes work
[18:10:26] <sammych> the UL is empty, and I type something in, filterablebeforefilter fires, ajax gets results, I loop through results, build templates of LIs and append them to the output UL
[18:10:41] <sammych> basically the demo
[18:10:51] <arschmitz> right
[18:11:02] <arschmitz> so your filtering the data yourself?
[18:11:11] <sammych> it's an ajax service, so...yes
[18:11:21] <arschmitz> well thats not how this works
[18:11:24] <arschmitz> it filter not you
[18:11:38] <arschmitz> yours suposed to give it the full dataset and it filters it based on the input value
[18:11:58] <sammych> that...kinda defeats the purpose of an ajax call
[18:12:01] <sammych> well, mine anyway
[18:12:19] <arschmitz> sammych: well why would you use a filter if you dont want to filter?
[18:12:24] <sammych> it's autocomplete, why should it be giving me everything, and I only need a bit?
[18:12:27] <arschmitz> your using a filter widget
[18:12:47] <arschmitz> autocomplete is just an example usage
[18:13:09] <arschmitz> sammych: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.3/filterable/
[18:13:11] <sammych> the data source has 10k's of rows. But never mind. I'll just remove the class and that's fine
[18:13:30] <arschmitz> sammych: you shouldnt be using the filter widget at all
[18:13:36] <arschmitz> because you dont want to filter it
[18:13:53] <arschmitz> just listen for change on the input and generate the listview based on your ajax call
[18:13:59] <arschmitz> its what your doing already basicly
[18:14:34] <sammych> hah. You know, I was doing this in the old version
[18:14:56] <sammych> this behaviour didn't appear to me in 1.3.2
[18:15:01] <sammych> so I never thought anything of it
[18:15:26] <arschmitz> it behivor was the same in 1.3 but the demo was different
[18:15:48] <sammych> so, now there is actually filtering going on in that event, I guess I could just go back and...just change the event name. that'll fix it right up
[18:15:53] <arschmitz> because before it was a filter made only for listview now there is a generic filter widget
[18:16:12] <arschmitz> sammych: just dont do data-filter at all
[18:16:16] <arschmitz> you dont want a filterable
[18:16:24] <sammych> fine
[18:17:39] <sammych> it makes sense. I was just porting old code. Not being difficult
[18:18:09] <sammych> the filterable enhanced the UL into the input and the result UL, so it was convenient
[18:18:37] <robertmaxrees> how cow it's almost 6:20
[18:19:20] <sammych> 11:20am*
[18:19:33] <robertmaxrees> haha
[18:19:38] <arschmitz> sammych: that behivor is deprecated in 1.4
[18:19:54] <arschmitz> the auto creating the input
[18:20:12] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
[18:20:32] <arschmitz> robinsmidsrod: west coaster
[18:20:40] <arschmitz> oops he left ha ha
[18:20:48] <arschmitz> killed my autocomplete
[18:21:00] <jaccob> robinsmidsrod, I made a work around to get it working: http://jsfiddle.net/ogevsa4w/2/
[18:21:12] <arschmitz> and got jaccob too lol
[18:21:34] <BillCriswell> arschmitz: Hahaha
[18:21:36] <sammych> ironic
[18:22:06] <BillCriswell> That's very unlike him to leave without saying something.
[18:22:33] <arschmitz> BillCriswell: he did he say something
[18:22:52] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[18:23:00] <BillCriswell> Well I'm just oblivious.
[18:23:01] <arschmitz> i was replaying to him saying he was leaving
[18:23:10] <arschmitz> but was not fast enough
[18:24:49] <BillCriswell> UNderstood. I'm just slow.
[18:25:38] <sammych> I see what you did there.
[18:30:18] <tester_> have problem with select2 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25655697/select2-optiongroup-display-error anybody?
[19:25:10] <tiblock> Hi. I want scroll page down. Is "$(window).scrollTop(9999999999)" okay?
[19:48:45] <sammych> I like this documentation on jQM
[19:48:45] <sammych> $( ".selector" ).table-columntoggle( "option", "columnBtnTheme", "b" );
[19:50:17] <arschmitz> sammych: where is that that does not work?
[19:52:48] <sammych> api docs, table toggle
[19:52:54] <sammych> http://api.jquerymobile.com/table-columntoggle/
[19:54:02] <arschmitz> ugh those are auto generated
[19:54:11] <sammych> FYI, $('#phone-table-popup-placeholder')['table-columntoggle'] doesn't load the init function either
[19:54:13] <arschmitz> there is only a table widget
[19:54:22] <sammych> that explains why everything works
[19:54:27] <sammych> still*
[19:54:51] <arschmitz> it pulls the widget name from the title
[19:55:31] <arschmitz> sammych: for anything table related its just table not table-columntoggle or table-reflow
[19:57:01] <sammych> yeah, that's what I thought
[20:22:41] <iSDP> is this also for jQuery mobile?
[20:24:42] <iSDP> i'm having a little problem with buttons not being their full width: http://darkbox.dead-pixel.nl/api/ming/configurable.html
[20:25:16] <iSDP> but i'd rather have full width horizontal grouped buttons
[20:27:34] <iSDP> how can i do that?
[20:59:48] <iSDP> i'm having a little problem with buttons not being their full width: http://darkbox.dead-pixel.nl/api/ming/configurable.html i would like them to be full width horizontal group buttons, how do i do this?
[21:25:03] <iSDP> i'm having a little problem with buttons not being their full width: http://darkbox.dead-pixel.nl/api/ming/configurable.html / https://github.com/iSDP/PebbleMijnING/blob/master/SERVERSIDE/configurable.html i would like them to be full width horizontal group buttons, how do i do this?
[21:37:24] <shebbi> iSDP: looks full width to me
[21:37:44] <iSDP> shebbi, wasn't before and this isn't really what i want
[21:37:49] <iSDP> i want them grouped :/
[22:42:50] <gurke_> good morning :)
[23:36:35] <litropy> It seems like the complete function of $.ajax fires before content has completely loaded.
[23:39:17] <sacho_> that's nice.
[23:41:33] <litropy> sacho_, is that how it's supposed to be?
[23:41:58] <litropy> I'm sorry. I meant success, not complete
[23:44:21] <sacho_> no.
[23:47:18] <litropy> sacho_, thanks for your input.
[23:49:43] <sacho_> no problem, I'm glad your issue was resolved.
