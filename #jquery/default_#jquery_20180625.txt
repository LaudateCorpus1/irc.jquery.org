[03:57:02] <Cork> kegster: you need to get the file as a blob in js then you create a objeect uri and attach it to an <a> element (with download="filename") and trigger a click on the element

[08:51:56] <Caspan> Hey guys tying to select an element that has a class of "SelectColumn: and has a data-it attribute of 6124
[08:51:59] <Caspan> $(".SelectedColumn [data-id='6124']")
[08:52:06] <Caspan> tried that with no luck.. any ideas
[08:52:15] <Cork> remove the space
[08:52:16] <Caspan> i even tried without the space
[08:52:39] <Cork> i rend to write them as $("[data-id='6124'].SelectedColumn") for readability
[08:53:02] <Caspan> i am trying to toggle a class on and off and it does not seem to be adding or removing the class to that element is why i think its not working
[08:53:14] <Caspan> Cork: okay
[08:53:31] <Caspan> let me play around then, somthign i am doing is wrong if that selector is right
[08:54:11] <Cork> Caspan: http://jsfiddle.net/modp18ra/1/
[09:00:11] <Caspan> Cork: im an idiot
[09:00:17] <Caspan> i am trying to improve code
[09:00:31] <Caspan> the old code was below it with an ifthen statment to toggle the class
[09:00:45] <Caspan> so what ever i was doign was being undone by the old code :)
[09:00:54] <Caspan> sorry and thank you
[09:01:07] <Cork> heh
[09:01:27] <Caspan> forgot to comment it out .. well got 1 line to replace 10
[09:02:06] <AdamPDotty> the bold code
[09:02:10] <Caspan> man i wrote this code so long ago and didnt have a clue about so many functions like toggleClass
[09:02:34] <Caspan> its like goign back to grade one and correcting a math quizz
[09:02:46] <Cork> heh
[09:02:55] <AdamPDotty> When I learned Javascript many clients asked for AJAX. Just had to tell them, can't be done.
[09:02:57] <Cork> ya, toggleClass can clean up a lot of code
[09:03:25] <Cork> can't be done??
[09:03:35] <Cork> or don't know how?
[09:03:39] <AdamPDotty> no ajax in 1997
[09:03:50] <Cork> there was actually
[09:03:56] <Cork> just not in all browsers
[09:04:28] <AdamPDotty> there was in irc :-)
[09:05:38] <Cork> ajax has technically existed sinse ie got activex support :)
[09:05:41] <AdamPDotty> There was stuff that did not work out, because I used http1.1 instead of 1.0
[09:05:52] <Cork> so ie5 if i remember correctly
[09:05:58] <Cork> oh, no sorry it was in ie4
[09:07:12] <AdamPDotty> our application depended on netscape navigator
[09:07:38] <AdamPDotty> a lot of document.write, too â€¦
[09:09:37] <Cork> ya, it was the hot stuff back then XD
[09:10:16] <AdamPDotty> elder backslashes
[09:10:50] <Cork> i remember the constant problem of moving content with document.write in them
[09:10:57] <Cork> "why the *** do i get two now" XD
[09:58:46] <Assid> hi
[09:58:57] <Assid> need some help with this : https://pastebin.com/kSTQL2T5
[09:59:40] <Cork> please make a jsfiddle showing the problem you're trying to solve
[10:00:23] <Assid> jsfiddle?
[10:00:36] <preference> go to https://jsfiddle.net/
[10:00:44] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/j4xLom7k/
[10:12:03] <z1haze> how can this be a common js module? is there anything that has to be done other than just tossing this into a js file and requiring it? since it attaches to the jquery object? https://bpaste.net/show/c2762269ac53
[10:16:31] <Cork> z1haze: that is how you write jquery plugins
[10:16:58] <Cork> you just need to load that after jquery one way or another (as one file or multiple)
[10:17:04] <Cork> s/file/resource/
[10:17:33] <z1haze> gotcha ty
[10:25:26] <Assid> https://jsfiddle.net/j4xLom7k/1/
[10:25:55] <Assid> change the Width .. it should trigger the getGrid function..
[10:26:58] <Assid> but im not able to get the length.... using alert($.parseXML(inpt).find("design").length);
[10:27:46] <Cork> Assid: you have a lot of html errors in that page
[10:28:25] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/j4xLom7k/4/ cleaned up a bit
[10:31:11] <Cork> Assid: also i would recommend to not used old dom0 event attributes
[10:31:21] <Assid> TypeError: $.parseXML(...).find is not a function
[10:31:32] <Assid> i keep getting the same thing
[10:34:01] <Cork> Assid: something in the code you load replaces the jquery lib
[10:34:03] <Assid> i would like to re-populate the html table.. but first off.. this should be able to work
[10:35:54] <Cork> Assid: you really should clean up this page
[10:36:07] <Cork> it is smack full of old 90's html hacks
[10:36:22] <Cork> and i suspect some of it is causing you problem
[10:37:22] <Cork> Assid: also btw $.parseXML doesn't wrap it in jquery
[10:37:31] <Cork> you want $($.parseXML()) for that
[10:37:53] <Assid> oh
[10:37:58] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/j4xLom7k/10/
[10:38:08] <Cork> but ya, the page is a pain to read from how it is constructed
[10:39:49] <Cork> a bit cleaned up https://jsfiddle.net/j4xLom7k/13/
[10:40:08] <Cork> opps forgot changing the trigger
[10:40:33] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/j4xLom7k/14/
[11:20:45] <z1haze> can you do `export default $.fn.myFunc...` ?
[11:21:41] <Cork> you don't
[11:21:47] <Cork> you export jquery
[11:22:09] <Cork> meaning you are modifying another object, you don't create a new one
[16:34:36] <Al_nz1> I have a HTML form that has collapsable sections - onload all sections default collapsed. The person filling out the form can expand only the sections that need to be filled out. When the HTML form gets submitted to the backend (springboot) it gets rendered to PDF. The issue is that when I put the JSON from the submit into a copy of the HTML template i cant replicate which sections are to be
[16:34:37] <Al_nz1> expanded and collapsed. I am wondering if there is a way to solve this with Jquery?
[16:35:31] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 you'll need to find a way to track that and send it over.
[16:37:01] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: right - something that needs backend stuff
[16:38:07] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 right.
[16:38:16] <robertmaxrees> jquery can't magically solve the entire problem for you.
[16:38:46] <Al_nz1> I live in hop e;-)
[16:38:53] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:39:06] <robertmaxrees> easiest would probably be an input that gets update with the sections that are expanded or w/e
[16:45:40] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yeah thats what I am thinking too
[16:47:04] <robertmaxrees> k
[21:04:34] <gambl0r3> hello?
[21:06:46] <pavonia> Your request couldn't be processed. Please try again.
[21:36:52] <kegster> i have a PHP script that calls upon a PDF generation API service that returns me a PDF file (as a string). Is there a way to make an ajax call to this php script and serve the file stream to the user as a download, instead of storing the file locally on the server, then serving it?
[21:56:18] <pavonia> kegster: Only if the server supports CORS requests
[21:58:26] <pavonia> Err wait, you probably want to route the API service stream through your server to the client
[23:41:19] <qwerjasdfuoi> What is the best way to re-order elements on a page?
[23:41:24] <qwerjasdfuoi> Detach?
