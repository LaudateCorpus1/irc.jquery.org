[00:21:08] <Cork> hayer_: just replace on with bind and you should be set to go
[00:43:49] <hayer_> Cork: thanks. Frontend and js is not my "strong side".. soo when people start assigning things inside a call I get confused >_>
[00:44:37] <Cork> hayer_: ya, i irked at that too

[01:14:00] <Technodrome> anyone here play with jquery isotopes alot?
[01:18:49] <Unopoo> hi guys, I want to load a xml file which stored the data I want to display in .html file on page loaded, so i defined a function 'loadXML()', it seems have no error, but 'undefined is not a function' error accur, I don't know why, here is the code:http://jsfiddle.net/hq3g3smq/
[01:28:53] <MaxSlot> Woet because i need help
[01:29:01] <Woet> MaxSlot: it already has the answer.
[01:30:26] <MaxSlot> I think can be more solutions
[01:31:54] <Woet> if you say so
[01:45:02] <Mark___> hmm, for some reason this doesn’t work either
[01:45:19] <Mark___> <script type="text/javascript">
[01:45:19] <Mark___> $(document).ready(function(){
[01:45:21] <Mark___> /$('.target').blurjs({
[01:45:22] <Mark___> /	source: 'body',
[01:45:24] <Mark___> /	radius: 17,
[01:45:25] <Mark___> /    draggable:true
[01:45:26] <Mark___> });
[01:45:27] <Mark___> </script>
[01:46:20] <Cork> Mark___: don't paste code in the channel
[01:46:28] <Mark___> sorry!
[01:46:30] <Cork> make a demo of the problem in jsfiddle
[01:46:35] <Cork> ?paste
[01:46:35] <b-ot> Cork: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:48:57] <Mark___> does anybody know the reason why i cannot make draggable layer in jquery anymore? has it been updated while i was gone?
[01:49:02] <Erwat> if i want to get the time every time i print out a string i would have to create a new Date object and get the time from there?
[01:50:06] <Cork> Erwat: yes
[01:50:32] <Erwat> thank you
[01:50:49] <Cork> Erwat: well Date.now() should be enough
[01:51:00] <Cork> but same same
[01:51:41] <Cork> Erwat: if this is for debugging there is normally console commands for this
[01:52:16] <Erwat> it is, but i want this to be a log that stays with the site
[01:52:27] <Erwat> i just don't want to see all this nonsense every time, just when necessary
[01:53:58] <Cork> Erwat: check if console.timeStamp exists
[01:54:15] <Cork> depending on what console you use it might
[01:56:48] <Erwat> it exists, but i don't think it'll be nice to use
[01:57:16] <Cork> why not?
[01:57:25] <Cork> console.timeStamp("normal console message")
[01:57:26] <Erwat> this is a log of network messages sent and received so behavior which differs based on what it's run on isn't that useful
[01:57:48] <Erwat> chrome requires you to have a timeline running for it to do anything for instance
[01:57:50] <Cork> and it would add a timestamp infron ot it
[01:57:57] <Cork> uh
[01:58:04] <Cork> that sucks
[01:58:38] <Erwat> you can add timestamps to the console on its own but since i'm saving the log in a string i'd like those to have timestamps
[02:10:14] <Jonatan> Hey guys. I'm doing a CrossDomain call with $.ajax, but it fails. In Charles Web Proxy, I can see the request is working, but it seems like jQuery dosent even wait for the response. They just say "fail", even when it dosent fail. How come?
[02:12:18] <Erwat> i'm surprised there isn't a getClockTime() function for js
[02:41:49] <hayer_> Why is it called "push" when its an array.
[02:42:10] <hayer_> You push onto a stack, and append into an array.
[03:08:54] <sweet2k4> im new to jquery. how would i select 3 diffirent classes at the same time like such: $('.flex1, flex2, flex3').slideUp(200);
[03:10:07] <sweet2k4> Lol, just forgot the dot before flex2 and flex3
[03:16:55] <PV_> hi everyone i have multiple select dropdown boxes and want to check if they have a selected value
[03:17:20] <PV_> like target[] is the name target[] control[] what would be a good way to approach this ? with a each loop? there should not be a selectbox with an empty value is my goal
[03:21:10] <laurent__> hi there ! ,  i'm using this ajax autocomplete  : https://github.com/devbridge/jQuery-Autocomplete
[03:21:49] <laurent__> the problem is i have to give id="autocomplete" to the element
[03:22:33] <laurent__> but i want to apply it on two elements
[03:28:50] <Cork> PV_: $('select').filter(function() { return $(this).val() == ''; })
[03:29:36] <Omar-> hi everyone
[03:29:55] <Cork> laurent__: have to give an id?
[03:30:00] <Cork> where do you have to use an id?
[03:30:47] <laurent__> i mean to make the autocomplete work  , i have to give the input id = autocomplete
[03:31:38] <Cork> laurent__: why?
[03:31:53] <Cork> you men cause of $('#autocomplete')?
[03:31:59] <laurent__> its ok , it works i've changes $('#autocomplete-ajax').autocomplete  to $('.autocomplete-ajax').autocomplete
[03:32:13] <laurent__> i haven't noticed it before
[03:32:30] <Cork> its a basic jquery selector
[03:32:33] <Cork> anything goes in there
[03:32:42] <Cork> you could use $('input') if you like
[03:32:50] <laurent__> right , but i'm not familiar with jquery
[03:32:54] <Cork> (would prob break things, but it would be valid :) )
[03:33:08] <Cork> laurent__: then you should start there
[03:33:46] <laurent__> $('input')  would make all input with auto complete ?
[03:34:00] <Cork> yes
[03:34:04] <laurent__> interesting
[03:34:09] <Cork> even checkboxes :)
[03:34:16] <Cork> so it would most likely break things
[03:34:32] <Cork> the point is its just css selectors
[03:34:42] <laurent__> ok thanks man
[03:39:04] <Omar-> hi Cork
[03:39:32] <Omar-> if enter this url in browser, you get json http://api.sba.gov/geodata/city_county_links_for_state_of/tx.json
[03:39:56] <Omar-> but when you use $.ajax you get No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'
[03:39:59] <Cork> ?ask
[03:40:00] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[03:40:34] <Omar-> i know it's a super noob question
[03:40:46] <Omar-> why broswer gets feedback while ajax no?
[03:42:20] <Cork> Omar-: my point is, just ask the question, don't ping me unless it is an answer to a question i've asked
[03:44:57] <ThKo> Hi guys, I’ve got a question about jQuery mobile. I’ve got a page named „questionsData.html“ … in my javascript file I fill this page with content by executing .append() on an div in this html-file…Beyond this there’s a link on the page which loads the same page (questionsData.html) with another content…But when I click the link and executes .append() it doesn’t fill the site…My variables are filled out…Any hints
[03:44:57] <ThKo> me? Is there a special function like refresh or something like that which I’ve to execute? :-) Thanks
[03:44:59] <Omar-> Cork I asked a question: why broswer gets feedback while ajax no?
[03:45:35] <Cork> "Omar-!*@* added to ignore list." -- learn some manners!
[03:46:18] <Omar-> ThKo which version of jQM are you using?
[03:46:40] <ThKo> Omar-: 1.4.4
[03:46:42] <Cork> ThKo: i think there is, but i'm not very good with jqm
[03:47:27] <Omar-> ThKo so you're loading the same page twice?
[03:47:40] <Omar-> Cork this is rude, anyway thanks
[03:48:06] <ThKo> Omar-: Yes, linking from page A to page A. (right, A to A) only with other content
[03:48:08] <Omar-> ThKo is ajaxEnabled set to true or false (default: true)
[03:49:14] <Omar-> ThKo try $.mobile.pageContainer.pagecontainer("change", "questionsData.html", { reloadPage: true })
[03:49:53] <Omar-> this reloads questionsData.html if jQM's ajax navigation is "on"
[03:50:37] <ThKo> Omar-: Ok I understand. I see that he reloads the page (it’s blank), but doesn’t fill it up with the content in a varibale which is filled out (I see by alerting this)
[03:51:20] <Omar-> ThKo then you have the same page duplicated in DOM
[03:51:42] <Omar-> if you're using Chrome, hit "f12" and check DOM (Elements tab)
[03:52:25] <ThKo> Omar-: That’s my problem, I’m using jQuery mobile combined with Android for generating android apps…Debugging in chrome isn’t possible I think? :(
[03:53:07] <Omar-> ThKo why are linking to same page? if you want to reload same page with fresh data use the below function
[03:53:31] <Omar-> $.mobile.pageContainer.pagecontainer("change", "questionsData.html", { allowSamePageTransition: true, reloadPage: true })
[03:54:41] <ThKo> Ok, last question ;-) I’ve got two buttons…goBack (previous question) and goForward (next question)…What’s the best way to reload by clicking one of these questions? if( $(…).click( funct….) ?
[03:55:20] <Omar-> ThKo yes, but make sure you dont add duplicate click listeners
[03:55:32] <ThKo> Ok, thanks a lot Omar-
[03:55:43] <Omar-> when you reload a page, it runs same functions
[03:56:04] <Omar-> so it's better to wrap them in "pagecreate" event as it fires once per page
[03:56:12] <Omar-> ThKo you're welcome :)
[03:56:55] <Omar-> ThKo note that reloadPage is deprecated in favor to "reload" but the latter doesn't function as it should
[03:57:08] <ThKo> Ok! I’ll try it :)
[03:57:19] <Omar-> http://api.jquerymobile.com/pagecontainer/#method-change
[04:01:49] <Erwat> which would make more sense for a game: doing POST or GET requests to exchange data with the server?
[04:05:24] <Cork> Erwat: doesn't really matter
[04:05:31] <shilon> hey, I’m using masonry responsive, anyone knows how can I remove the horziontal scroll masonry creates when reorganizing the divs while I’m resizing the browser window?
[04:05:53] <Cork> Erwat: but if you give data to the server it is normally post
[04:06:03] <Cork> Erwat: and to get data (that my cache) you use get
[04:06:14] <Cork> Erwat: post never cache
[04:06:27] <Erwat> yeah i know that it doesn't matter, been using GET, but i happened to reread what POST is for and realized that technically i've been using GET wrong
[04:08:07] <Cork> Erwat: basically if the request changes something on the server it shouldn't be a get
[04:08:30] <Erwat> which in the case of a game is literally everything
[04:08:38] <Cork> Erwat: did we talk about websocket, or was that someone else?
[04:08:45] <Erwat> someone else
[04:08:51] <Erwat> i know about websocket
[04:09:02] <Erwat> or well, i use it, not entirely sure how much i "know" about it
[04:09:06] <Cork> it sounds like it is what you should be using to be honest
[04:09:30] <Erwat> well it's something that has to be able to handle multiple servers
[04:09:40] <Erwat> one of them is websocket specific but one is just pure http mess
[04:09:54] <Erwat> and the http mess can't really bec hanged anymore
[04:10:27] <Cork> Erwat: also restful adds an additional part to the mix
[04:10:31] <Cork> put
[04:10:49] <Erwat> they're supposed to be for file uploads and similar though, no?
[04:10:57] <Cork> no
[04:11:04] <delboy1978uk> i have a jQueryUI Datepicker, I need the date range to be from 1st Jan 2014 to the 4th December 2014, how would i do this?
[04:11:14] <Cork> put/patch (the later is standard and is what they are moving over to)
[04:11:22] <Cork> is basically for when a post is updated
[04:11:26] <Cork> and post when one is created
[04:11:44] <delboy1978uk> i set yearRange as '2014:2014' and that seems to have sorted the year, but still bits of december are clickable
[04:11:48] <Cork> Erwat: but that is extending the verbs of http a bit
[04:12:27] <Erwat> i see, well, while that sounds even more "correct" that's not exactly important
[04:14:13] <Erwat> thanks a lot Cork
[04:14:36] <Cork> Erwat: ya, the only thing that really matters is what one does with get
[04:14:48] <Cork> as it has special meaning in browsers and in cross domain permissions
[04:29:01] <hollusion> how do i map serializeArray to this form {fieldName: fieldValue} ?
[04:31:51] <Cork> hollusion: have a look at serializeObject
[04:31:59] <Cork> (plugin)
[04:57:23] <ThKo> Omar-: Sorry for hightlighting again. I’ve tested your solution but it doesn’t work for me…You also think there are for example two div with the same name in DOM? When I get the length of the div it always returns 1 (only 1 div with this name)…I’ve tested to insert data with .append and .html etc. Maybe another hint for me? Thanks
[04:58:20] <KyleSmith> Hello, is there any idea why this isn't being replaced? http://pastie.org/9646921
[05:01:56] <Omar-> ThKo
[05:02:06] <Omar-> can you provide a fiddle?
[05:02:55] <ThKo> One moment, I’ve got another idea. When it doesn’t work, I try to give you the necessary code
[05:02:57] <Omar-> KyleSmith $("#SueSaviesLLP").val("REGULAR LARGE");
[05:03:06] <Omar-> no spaces and forgot hash "#"
[05:03:14] <KyleSmith> so no spaces are allowed?
[05:03:32] <spygame> hey guys, i'm using jquery-multiselect. I have a hidden section with select box but $('select').multiselect() is not working. i try it in console it works though
[05:03:36] <Omar-> KyleSmith nope "-" or "_" hyphen or underscore
[05:03:37] <spygame> any suggestions
[05:03:50] <KyleSmith> ok thanks let me fix
[05:04:00] <Omar-> KyleSmith and "#" for ID "." for class
[05:04:10] <Omar-> ThKo ok
[05:07:53] <ThKo> Omar-: It’s no running example because of Cordova etc. http://jsfiddle.net/m0twnwww/ But this is my code for getting the data and fill out the div…Maybe you see an error. Thanks :)
[05:09:37] <KyleSmith> Omar, that didn't seem to fix it.
[05:10:36] <Omar-> KyleSmith my bad .text() not .val()
[05:10:51] <KyleSmith> ok lets try that ty
[05:10:55] <Omar-> ThKo i'll check it
[05:11:07] <KyleSmith> cool thanks
[05:12:13] <Omar-> KyleSmith welcome :)
[05:15:02] <Omar-> ThKo can you briefly tell me what you're trying to achieve?
[05:25:36] <ThKo> Omar-: I try to replace the content of #output_questionsdata by the second call
[05:30:39] <HelperW> Grunt users here?
[05:44:31] <ThKo> Omar-: When I view the variables they are filled out right…But the .html() or .append() doesn’t work...
[05:47:50] <Omar-> ThKo i was afk
[05:47:55] <ThKo> np ;)
[05:49:47] <Omar-> ThKo $('.mainpage').css( 'color' , color2 + " !important" ); this is wrong
[05:50:21] <ThKo> Why? On first call it works fine. Only by recalling the same page it doesn’t work :/
[05:50:23] <Omar-> you can't use "!important" in .css()
[05:51:56] <ThKo> But this doesn’t fix my problem :(
[05:53:01] <Omar-> how do you replace the page?
[05:53:07] <Omar-> are you using same IDs?
[05:53:46] <Omar-> ThKo are you using id="output_questionsdata" in every page?
[05:54:01] <ThKo> No, only on the questionsData.html
[05:54:25] <ThKo> Maybe we are at cross purposes
[05:55:10] <Omar-> ThKo it's difficult to understand the problem from that piece of code
[05:55:40] <Omar-> what I have understood is you want to load new question on button click right
[05:55:41] <Omar-> ?
[05:55:50] <Omar-> previous/next buttons
[05:55:54] <ThKo> For example: First time I click button A with parameter cid = 5 … It loads the page questionsData.html with grabbed data from database by cid = 5 … Then I want to click Button A again no with parameter cid = 6 … Now it loads the questionsData.html, grabs the data from database but doesn’t show it on the page.
[05:55:59] <ThKo> Yep
[05:56:42] <adac> guys on one of my views I try to invoke the datetimepicker  via: "$('#schedule-datetime').datetimepicker({"
[05:56:59] <adac> there it just works fine. On another view however, it doesn't work at all
[05:57:03] <Omar-> ThKo jQM ignore search in url questionsData.html?cid=6
[05:57:23] <RizziCR> adac: what doesn’t work ?
[05:57:25] <adac> the JS is also laoded there, but nothing happens as soon as I click onto the text filed
[05:57:34] <adac> *field
[05:57:47] <RizziCR> different field id ?
[05:57:49] <ThKo> I’ve got a workaround for that. I see by alerting the result of my db query that it grabs the right record. But .append() or .html() doesn’t work…And I don’t know why
[05:57:51] <RizziCR> wrong selector ?
[05:58:19] <Omar-> ThKo check this http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.4/navigation-hash-processing/
[05:58:23] <adac> RizziCR, according to firebug it is the same id: schedule-datetime
[05:58:48] <adac> RizziCR, so the same id that works also in the other view
[05:59:08] <Omar-> ThKo ok lets try something
[05:59:30] <RizziCR> adac: no error in firebug ?
[05:59:42] <RizziCR> adac: alle dependent javascripts loaded ?
[06:00:29] <adac> RizziCR, nope no error so far. Maybe angulajs is messing something up with jquery
[06:00:44] <Omar-> ThKo
[06:00:45] <Omar-> var activePage = $.mobile.pageContainer.pagecontainer("getActivePage");
[06:00:45] <Omar-> $("#output_questionsdata", activePage).html(results.rows.item(i).question + "<br /><br />").enhanceWithin();
[06:01:10] <ThKo> In case of: $("#output_questionsdata").html( results.rows.item(i).question + "<br /><br />" ).trigger( "create" ); ?
[06:01:26] <adac> RizziCR, Yes it seems to be an angularjs issue, interfering somehow with jquery
[06:01:37] <adac> just commented out the other stuff and now it works
[06:01:43] <adac> *angular stuff
[06:01:44] <ThKo> *place
[06:01:59] <RizziCR> adac:
[06:02:02] <RizziCR> adac: :D
[06:02:18] <RizziCR> adac: ok.. angular is not my ;)
[06:02:19] <Omar-> ThKo yes
[06:02:29] <ThKo> I try, thanks, one moment
[06:02:30] <adac> RizziCR, yeah i see :P
[06:02:51] <adac> RizziCR, hey but thanks for helping me debugging!
[06:03:22] <RizziCR> adac: no problem..
[06:06:19] <ThKo> Omar-: Great! Thanks. Now it works for the first click on „next“ and „prev“ but not on the new page :) Thanks
[06:06:50] <ThKo> Omar-: So I’ll take your code also for the before and next buttons
[06:07:23] <Omar-> ThKo so half solution now haha
[06:08:17] <Omar-> ThKo it's because all pages are in DOM resutling in multiplied IDs.
[06:08:37] <Omar-> use activePage method to target element in current page
[06:09:14] <Omar-> i gtg now
[06:16:55] <FoolsRun> Hi, I'm trying to replace a predictable string in a <textarea> with ""  (nothing). I can't get it to work. Anyone got a sec to help me figure this out?
[06:18:16] <Cork> ?paste @ FoolsRun
[06:18:16] <b-ot> FoolsRun: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[06:19:56] <FoolsRun> Cork:  http://pastebin.com/bpehzvzz  (it would take all day to make a working example)
[06:20:22] <Cork> FoolsRun: doens't have to be working, but please use jsfiddle in the future
[06:20:30] <Cork> makes giving you an answer much simpler
[06:20:45] <FoolsRun> Ah, noted
[06:20:53] <Cork> ah.text
[06:20:56] <Cork> use .val()
[06:21:02] <FoolsRun> I tried without .text... ahhh
[06:21:09] <Cork> also .replace returns the changed string
[06:21:11] <Cork> it doesn't set it
[06:21:19] <FoolsRun> Is there a good way to set it?
[06:21:26] <FoolsRun> concise way, I should say?
[06:21:47] <Cork> var input = $('#input_1_1'); input.val(input.val().replace(' ', ''));
[06:22:13] <FoolsRun> so val() is necessary even for a textarea?
[06:22:23] <Cork> for all field elements
[06:22:26] <FoolsRun> I used .text because textarea isn't an input.
[06:22:27] <FoolsRun> Interesting
[06:22:48] <Cork> .val is there to make a generic function to handle values for input fields
[06:23:01] <Cork> and by input i don't mean just <input>
[06:23:09] <FoolsRun> Gotcha
[06:23:09] <Cork> but <select> <textarea> and so on
[06:23:46] <Cork> FoolsRun: note that <textarea> has text inside it as child elements in html
[06:23:49] <Cork> but not in dom
[06:23:56] <Cork> that is why .text() fails
[06:25:08] <FoolsRun> Hmm... no error but still not working right. Closer though! Thanks.
[06:26:58] <FoolsRun> replace() can do multi lines, right?
[06:27:41] <FoolsRun> Got it
[06:28:54] <Cork> FoolsRun: http://jsfiddle.net/02f1c549/
[06:31:23] <FoolsRun> Cork: thanks a ton!
[06:35:57] <jonkristian> Should I/Can I use $.map when i have to sum up length of various inputs?
[06:36:21] <jonkristian> Or should I use each?
[06:37:18] <zfmf> he guys, i recalculate the ui.size on resize event because of the zoom i need on the page,  but its stopping resizing before i calculated the new size,  i think it has something with this changelog: http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/10351 is there a way to check the size after i calculated :D
[06:38:07] <Cork> jonkristian: you prob want .each
[06:38:27] <Cork> jonkristian: if you don't need support for older ie (ie<9) you could try map
[06:38:43] <Cork> and then .reduce to sum up the values in the array
[06:38:46] <jonkristian> Cork, I did join("+") and eval, is that fine?
[06:38:59] <Cork> jonkristian: yuck!
[06:39:00] <Cork> no

[06:40:39] <frank_o> Hi! If I'm on a mobile device (or emulate one through Chrome) -- how come when going to https://youtube.com/watch?v=R7T_2RVQBv0 I get YouTube's mobile version, but when opening it via jQuery Embedly -- http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/116 -- I get YouTube's desktop version?
[06:46:11] <frank_o> Maybe Embedly is cloaking my user agent somehow?
[06:48:59] <ashgotti> Hello all. I need a bit of help understanding jquery mobile. I have a small project that is 5 pages: 1 landing page and 4 sub-pages that are prefetched. I'm trying to figure out what is the best practice for where I put script code: on the first page or on each of the subpages?
[06:57:06] <frank_o_> ashgotti: I basically have one file that runs each time a new page loads, ie. `$(document).on('pagecontainershow', function() {`
[06:58:15] <ashgotti> frank_o_: I'm just trying to figure out the best way to structure this. I'd love to have all my code in one place but right now I have it all in <script> tags at the bottom of each sub page
[07:00:48] <frank_o_> ashgotti: Ah yeah, not good. This is how I do it with Rails: http://runnable.com/VC0ltmGpXmIgflfw/basic-rails-with-jqm-example -- basically my script tags are outside each jQM page
[07:01:23] <frank_o_> ashgotti: in app/views/layouts/application.html.erb

[07:55:32] <MaxSlot> Need help: how make to scroll only one div that is mouseover(hovered) but prevent body scrolling
[07:55:52] <shilon> Hello, I’m creating a menu with a submenu that only gets active on click, but I also want to make the submenu active the first link always. This is, the main menu link is the same as the first submenu child. Can anyone help me?
[07:57:32] <Omar-> MaxSan have you tride $("#element").animate({scrollTop : 100})
[07:57:36] <Omar-> tried*
[07:59:17] <MaxSlot> i talk about my app if you remember its inject to webpage and have own default scrolls they scroll page too
[07:59:40] <tirengarfio> how to check if the content of <span> has changed? I have tried this: $('.total').on('change', function() { alert("jfls");});  but it doesn't work
[08:00:14] <Omar-> MaxSan http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/t0qopdmc/
[08:00:56] <Omar-> sorry MaxSlot
[08:00:58] <Omar-> ^
[08:01:20] <Omar-> MaxSlot maybe someone else was helping you
[08:01:33] <MaxSlot> nope
[08:02:48] <decx> tirengarfio you'll have to setup your own spanchange event and trigger it when you do the changing, change only happens on formfields
[08:03:08] <Omar-> tirengarfio i dont know if there is a native event to check if DOM has been changed.
[08:03:18] <decx> there are but they are crappy
[08:03:48] <Omar-> MaxSlot ok, what do you want to achieve?
[08:04:17] <shilon> Hello, I’m creating a menu with a submenu that only gets active on click, but I also want to make the submenu active the first link always. This is, the main menu link is the same as the first submenu child. Can anyone help me?
[08:05:56] <MaxSlot> yes
[08:08:39] <Omar-> MaxSlot yes what?
[08:08:58] <pneftali> .
[08:09:05] <MaxSlot> i have my app in webpage and this app(fixed div with modules(more divs)) have default scroll bar and then i scroll bar(mouse wheel) down any module body scroll too i need to prevent it
[08:10:35] <MaxSlot> i need scroll only one div that i hovered(mouseover) or something like that but prevent body scrolling
[08:11:35] <Omar-> MaxSlot hmmm let me think about it
[08:11:53] <MaxSlot> I would greatly appreciate
[08:16:55] <dmsuperman> MaxSlot: if you do the scrollbars correctly with just CSS that should be the behavior
[08:17:12] <dmsuperman> sounds like you're messing with the default scroll behavior, which leads to unexpected interface behavior like this
[08:17:53] <Omar-> MaxSlot http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/sntzbdcy/ lets assume this is your page
[08:19:01] <MaxSlot> http://jsfiddle.net/sntzbdcy/4/
[08:19:32] <MaxSlot> body is webpage, class="foo" is app
[08:20:37] <MaxSlot> then i scroll app it does not scroll body
[08:21:39] <Omar-> MaxSlot once you reach the end of scrollable app?
[08:21:44] <MaxSlot> yes
[08:21:57] <Omar-> you want to prevent body from scrolling
[08:22:07] <MaxSlot> yes
[08:22:08] <Omar-> scrolling down but scolling up is fine
[08:22:11] <Omar-> ok
[08:22:16] <Omar-> hi frank_o
[08:22:17] <MaxSlot> scroll up too
[08:22:22] <Omar-> both?
[08:22:30] <MaxSlot> yes must scroll only app
[08:23:10] <MaxSlot> body scrolling must be then im not hovered(mouseover) app
[08:27:52] <Omar-> MaxSlot http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/rsdpu4za/
[08:28:09] <Omar-> calculate scrollHeight and compare it with scrollTop
[08:28:31] <Omar-> once scrollTop equals scrollHeight, return false or do whatever you want
[08:28:47] <Omar-> scrollHeight - element height
[08:29:06] <MaxSlot> oh ty nice solution, you best!
[08:30:50] <Omar-> you're welcome
[08:31:17] <Omar-> another satisfied customer ;)
[08:34:03] <Otineb> hey everyone. I’m looking for help calling functions from within an iframe. I’m slaved to a terrible proprietary CMS that puts alot of it’s content in iframes. Doing this instantly cuts off all my jquery and js library dependencies that I need. Worse still, teh only way to get javascript INSIDE the iframe is to use snippets that then have to be manually added to each field via a form builder. So, specifically, I’m using an inputMask library that format
[08:34:04] <Otineb> numbers on the fly. Normal syntax is usually $(‘#foo’).mask(‘(999) 999-9999’); I have no idea how to call this library from WITHIN teh iframe. Here’s a fiddle that tries to help illustrate my dilemma. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/5hfhtLsu/2/
[08:34:24] <dmsuperman> MaxSlot: I would personally just add overflow: hidden to the body when the mouse is over the "apps" instead of trying to fight the normal scroll behavior
[08:35:38] <Otineb> i should also mention that I found a glimmer of hope in the “parent.function_name();” method but I’m not sure how to implement that in my scenario
[08:37:08] <Omar-> dmsuperman i second your opinion
[08:38:16] <MaxSlot> dmsuperman the app start in right corner and fixed position it will be move
[08:39:05] <dmsuperman> MaxSlot: http://jsfiddle.net/sntzbdcy/5/
[08:39:24] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/2umnbarv/
[08:43:28] <Omar-> http://api.sba.gov/geodata/city_county_links_for_state_of/tx.json this link returns json on browser
[08:43:49] <MaxSlot> http://jsfiddle.net/sntzbdcy/6/
[08:43:57] <Omar-> but when using $.ajax I get 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'
[08:43:58] <MaxSlot> red is my app and moving like sh*t
[08:44:18] <dmsuperman> Omar-: what's the question? ;)
[08:44:27] <MaxSlot> Omar- solution is best for now
[08:44:46] <dmsuperman> MaxSlot: eh? it seems to be behaving exactly like you asked
[08:44:47] <Omar-> dmsuperman how can I make ajax call?
[08:44:59] <dmsuperman> Omar-: $.ajax? or you mean via the browser
[08:45:05] <dmsuperman> I don't think you can via the browser itself
[08:45:28] <dmsuperman> if you're using chrome, open the network tab, right click the ajax request, and there should be an option for "copy cURL command"
[08:45:34] <dmsuperman> that will let you repeat the request via command line
[08:45:36] <Omar-> dmsuperman i want to do ajax
[08:45:46] <dmsuperman> but not from the browser. you can't force an ajax request from the browser
[08:46:29] <Omar-> dmsuperman i'm new to such tech, why browser works while ajax doesnt?
[08:46:53] <dmsuperman> the ajax request is different. I think it sends a different header
[08:47:04] <dmsuperman> and I don't think you can force send a header with a normal browser request
[08:47:09] <dmsuperman> maybe with a plugin.
[08:47:31] <Omar-> dmsuperman even cross-domain: true doesn't change anything
[08:47:49] <Omar-> crossDomain: true
[08:48:29] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/m200j1u3/
[09:10:25] <ustunozg_> I have a weird situation where jquery insists on sending the request to http site even if I give it a relative path and am on the https site
[09:10:31] <ustunozg_> anyone encountered something similar?
[09:10:38] <ustunozg_> it doesn't happen with all requests
[09:10:41] <ustunozg_> just a particular request
[09:10:47] <ustunozg_> where it insists on sending to http
[09:12:24] <Poppabear> ok so i am not getting much help from angularjs on this issue now for the last 2 hrs, hopefully someone here can help ? http://pastebin.com/iYQgzE3T
[09:14:12] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear is .get() an ajax method?
[09:14:29] <robertmaxrees> because if it is, the console.log() is running before the ajax call completes.
[09:14:52] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: let me show you what i have
[09:14:53] <Poppabear> sec
[09:15:02] <robertmaxrees> erm, i don't know anything about angular.
[09:15:27] <robertmaxrees> but if that .get() is like the one in jquery, then that'd explain your problem.  you have to put the console log in the success callback.
[09:16:32] <Poppabear> http://pastebin.com/BzJ4aHq5
[09:16:43] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change anything.
[09:16:58] <robertmaxrees> your console.log() call has to be in the callback for that .get()
[09:17:11] <Poppabear> i get the correct log inside the success callback
[09:17:19] <robertmaxrees> right.  you won't get it outside.
[09:17:44] <Poppabear> but i do in other controllers in a similiar aproach
[09:17:51] <Poppabear> but there is a difference
[09:17:53] <Poppabear> hmm
[09:18:08] <robertmaxrees> the ajax call is cached or returning super fast.
[09:18:21] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on the ajax call finishing must be in the success callback
[09:18:25] <robertmaxrees> you don't really have a choice.
[09:20:18] <Poppabear> this in another controller works fine, so how does it work here so i know how to refactor my code ? http://pastebin.com/zi8BSfAy
[09:20:49] <robertmaxrees> because the connect event probably fires after the success returns.
[09:21:00] <robertmaxrees> i don't know anything about angular, so I can't really be of much there, though.
[09:21:52] <Poppabear> yea, you see why i am a bit confused, but it makes sense what you are saying
[09:22:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd keep asking in the angular channel for more help or check out their docs for more info.
[09:24:10] <Poppabear> yea, thanks you have atleast given me some sort of idea on whats going on with it :P
[09:26:46] <Poppabear> might be able to still use the success callback to accomplish my goal if done correctly
[09:52:22] <stan_man_can> I'm getting some JSON from the server
[09:52:50] <stan_man_can> If I use $.getJSON(url, vars, function(data) { return data; }
[09:52:55] <stan_man_can> can I pass that "data" around between functions ?
[09:55:55] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to work the way you want it to.
[09:56:05] <robertmaxrees> explicitly call the other functions in the callback.
[09:56:53] <stan_man_can> I guess I need to know  how to turn the results of a $.getJSON call into a literal
[09:57:08] <robertmaxrees> "into a literal" what?
[09:57:41] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: From what I've read you can't pass regular objects into functions in Javascript
[09:57:43] <stan_man_can> only "literals"
[09:57:47] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:57:49] <stan_man_can> i have no idea what that means yet I'm still looking
[09:57:49] <NoiseEee> stan_man_can: you can pass whatever you like
[09:57:58] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can everything is an objecyt.
[09:58:07] <stan_man_can> NoiseEee: Well
[09:58:07] <robertmaxrees> so you can pass everything.
[09:58:16] <stan_man_can> hrm
[09:58:19] <robertmaxrees> functions, strings, arrays, plain ol' objects...
[09:59:04] <stan_man_can> NoiseEee: What I have is var track = get_track(id);
[09:59:20] <stan_man_can> get_track just does a $.getJSON("ajax.php", {whatewver}, function(data) { return data; }
[09:59:45] <robertmaxrees> that's not going to return the right way
[09:59:47] <NoiseEee> stan_man_can: then as robertmaxrees says, just calling a function after "var track = " and passing track isn't going to do what you think.
[09:59:48] <stan_man_can> inside that anon function if I say console.log(data) it shows my object properly, however if I console.log the return value of get_track it's nothing
[10:00:01] <NoiseEee> this is basic async stuff with xhr
[10:00:25] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can you need to set that var inside the success callback.
[10:00:30] <robertmaxrees> you can't do what you're trying to do.
[10:00:37] <stan_man_can> Ah
[10:00:39] <stan_man_can> Alrighty
[10:00:50] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on the data returning needs to be called explicitly.
[10:00:54] <stan_man_can> Sorry, primarily a server side guy
[10:01:16] <robertmaxrees> ajax is async - the request fires and the browser keeps trucking along, doing it's thing.
[10:01:43] <stan_man_can> Ahh alright, so when I'm trying to assign var track = get_track(id)
[10:01:45] <robertmaxrees> you have to tell it what it should do after that data comes back.  code coming after executes before the ajax call completes.
[10:01:51] <stan_man_can> there's nothing for it to asasign since the data hasn't beenr eturned yet
[10:02:11] <robertmaxrees> sort of - the $.get() call isn't returning the data you think it is.
[10:02:16] <stan_man_can> aka it won't wait for the get_track function to complete before assigning it
[10:02:19] <stan_man_can> kk
[10:02:23] <stan_man_can> thank you thank you
[10:02:42] <robertmaxrees> you're returning to $.get(), but that doesn't return the data sent to it.
[10:03:13] <stan_man_can> even if I'm explicitely telling it to return the results of the call?
[10:03:35] <robertmaxrees> the inline function is returning to the $.get() call.
[10:03:40] <whatadewitt> is this the place to ask about jquery ui>
[10:03:44] <robertmaxrees> $.get() doesn't return what you gave it.
[10:03:47] <robertmaxrees> whatadewitt yep.
[10:04:23] <kantakt> jquery is really cool!!!
[10:04:27] <whatadewitt> robertmaxrees: i am using "draggable" but i want my "clone" to be in the root of my app
[10:04:35] <whatadewitt> like, the <body> tag
[10:04:40] <whatadewitt> is that possible?
[10:04:45] <robertmaxrees> whatadewitt i don't know much about jquery ui so not sure :)
[10:04:49] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/f50859403ee69327c6f4 is what I hvae right now
[10:04:56] <whatadewitt> lol
[10:05:01] <whatadewitt> anyone?
[10:05:11] <MeXTuX> I have list <ul> with three li's. One of those li's has a "data-filter-default" attribute set to true. How can I select that li based on data-filter-default attribute. Is that possible?
[10:05:21] <stan_man_can> so essentially everything needs to kind of cascade down. I should be calling get_track, and then display_track() with the results
[10:05:24] <whatadewitt> OMG I AM BLIND
[10:05:30] <whatadewitt> and missed the "appendTo" option
[10:05:33] <whatadewitt> i need a drink
[10:05:40] <robertmaxrees> MeXTuX do a filter or each and use .data()
[10:06:07] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can right - you're returning to $.getJSON() - $.getJSON itself doesn't return what you give it.
[10:06:45] <stan_man_can> MeXTuX: $("ul li[data-filter-default]
[10:06:54] <robertmaxrees> don't select on data attributes :(
[10:07:21] <Scriptonaut> what exactly is the "complete" event
[10:07:35] <Scriptonaut> in this app I'm working on, it appears that it's being used like a click event
[10:07:59] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut would need context - this in ajax?
[10:08:02] <stan_man_can> MeXTuX: $("ul li[data-filter-default]"}
[10:08:18] <robertmaxrees> MeXTuX don't select on data attributes if you can avoid it.
[10:08:33] <stan_man_can> oops didn't mean to paste that again
[10:08:48] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut http://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/ this might be of interest.
[10:10:28] <Scriptonaut> yes I think ajax is involved
[10:10:47] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut probably has something to do with when the ajax returns.
[10:12:53] <MeXTuX> In this case clicking on a li will trigger an AJAX request. But every li gets different stuff from server. One of those li's is the default (the first AJAX request that is going to be executed when the page loads)
[10:13:07] <MeXTuX> but need to know which one is the default
[10:13:37] <robertmaxrees> MeXTuX don't do that.  use an IIFE or something to run that first request explicitly.
[10:13:38] <MeXTuX> so I don't know other way to select element without using data attribute
[10:13:57] <MeXTuX> IIFE?
[10:14:02] <Scriptonaut> I'm curious if anyone here knows, is it possible to copy stuff to the clipboard /without/ using adobe flash?
[10:14:12] <robertmaxrees> MeXTuX if you really have to rely on markup for something like that, use .filter()
[10:14:19] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[10:14:19] <Scriptonaut> right now this is apparently the only way to achieve it
[10:14:51] <sweet2k4> does anyone know a good site for checking site on diffirent resolutions, like ipad, iphone, etc?
[10:15:02] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4 use chrome's device emulation.
[10:15:21] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: is it a plugin?
[10:15:25] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut you'd have to involve swf at some point.
[10:15:29] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4 it's built in./
[10:15:46] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode
[10:16:20] <Scriptonaut> right now we're doing it like: var cl_clip = new ZeroClipboard($(this), { moviePath: "/ZeroClipboard.swf" });
[10:16:35] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut yep.  you have to use flash at some point in the process to copy the text.
[10:18:26] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: okey found it, thanks a lot!
[10:34:07] <frank_o> Hi! If emulating a mobile device through Chrome -- how come jQuery Embedly returns YouTube's desktop version? http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/116
[10:34:10] <frank_o> If going straight to the embedded video -- https://youtube.com/watch?v=R7T_2RVQBv0 one ofcourse gets YouTube's mobile version. I spoke to Embedly they claim it's not their fault :S
[10:34:31] <Scriptonaut> I need help understanding how events remain bound. See thsi code here: https://gist.github.com/robins35/0b3e9e7e9c5b27d6114f
[10:34:54] <Scriptonaut> I run that function at the beginning, and when I click on the icons .cl-ar, it works just fine
[10:35:16] <Scriptonaut> however, if I disable and then enable these icons (which involves changing the class names), it no longer acts bound
[10:35:23] <ccmonster> do yiou guys usually build elemnts with strings ("<div class='aclass'>Somecontent</div>
[10:35:41] <Scriptonaut> if you attaach an event to something via class, like I am, does changing that class name break the bond?
[10:36:02] <ccmonster> or do you build them doing <div></div>.propr({'key':'val', 'key2':'val2'})
[10:36:11] <ccmonster> prop*
[10:36:58] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut did you try making a test case fiddle to see?
[10:38:39] <robertmaxrees> ccmonster depends on the case.  there's a third syntax you can use
[10:39:41] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut - http://jsfiddle.net/06c5vd04/
[10:41:43] <Scriptonaut> ah, so it shouldn't mattert
[10:41:54] <Scriptonaut> then why the hell is my event becoming unbound :(
[10:42:12] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut the selector doesn't manually unless something is running .off() or things are getting re-run.
[10:58:12] <yashi> Why is http://www.phys.ethz.ch/~jshapiro/moebius.html working on the desktop, but not on the iPad, even though I added touchstart touchmove etc..?
[10:59:31] <Otineb> does anyone know how to call a function from WITHIN an iframe?
[10:59:45] <Otineb> i’ve tried parent.function_name(); and got nowhere
[11:00:05] <Otineb> window.top.function_name(); also didnt seem to work for me
[11:01:53] <Scriptonaut> YES
[11:02:19] <Scriptonaut> I figured it out. One last question. if I have some event like: $(document).on('dblclick', '.marketer .disable', function() {});
[11:02:42] <robertmaxrees> *handler - that's not the event.
[11:02:43] <Scriptonaut> how can I say: if you have a child <a> with class cl-ar, do this code
[11:02:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:02:44] <ThKo> Hi guys, I’ve got a problem: Look at the part at id=… … I don’t see the wood for the trees… http://jsfiddle.net/wnam0ump/ No error or something like that, only not displaying the checkboxes … Any hints? Thanks :)
[11:02:52] <Scriptonaut> yes :P
[11:03:41] <robertmaxrees> and you can use the :contains() selector in that second are or wrap your logic in a check that uses http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[11:03:43] <respek> oooh, unheap.com/# is such a nice little resource
[11:04:02] <respek> *http://www.unheap.com/# for anyone interested
[11:04:15] <respek> it's a repo of jquery plugins! preeettty cool
[11:06:04] <robertmaxrees> neat
[11:07:31] <frank_o> wow
[11:08:52] <respek> :)
[11:10:16] <Scriptonaut> what's this mean: $('input.marketer-update', this).blahblah
[11:10:31] <Scriptonaut> does that mean inputs with class marketer-update inside this?
[11:10:31] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('input.marketer-update')
[11:10:40] <robertmaxrees> shortcut for .find()
[11:10:42] <Scriptonaut> so yes?
[11:10:47] <Scriptonaut> I'm not familiar with find heh
[11:11:09] <robertmaxrees> check it out in the docs :)
[11:11:16] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery find
[11:11:21] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .find() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/find/
[11:11:23] <Robdgreat> find is somewhat fundamental, I thought
[11:11:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah it is.
[11:13:51] <Kartagis> so, here's the scenario. I have got two pages and hence different field. I need to calculate a field on the 2nd page based on a field on the 1st page. how can I do this?
[11:14:26] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis what sort of browsers do you need to support?
[11:14:28] <Scriptonaut> is there such thing like each, but if you know there's only one child
[11:14:30] <Scriptonaut> like do
[11:14:51] <Scriptonaut> $('cl-ar', this).do(function() {blah}); would be nice
[11:15:06] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: given the group that need to use the site, ie too
[11:15:12] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis then use a cookie.
[11:15:55] <Kartagis> so I need to read about js and cookies, no?
[11:15:56] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut errr, you can.
[11:16:00] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis yep.
[11:16:09] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis otherwise you need to send data to your server and send it back.
[11:16:15] <Scriptonaut> I'm using each right now, it's working fine
[11:16:32] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut if there's only one element, don't use each.
[11:16:33] <robertmaxrees> that's slow.
[11:16:48] <ccmonster> robertmaxrees: what was the third syntax?
[11:18:16] <Scriptonaut> well then what do you suggest I use if not each?
[11:18:31] <robertmaxrees> just run your code.
[11:18:37] <robertmaxrees> jquery usually checks for you before doing things.
[11:18:40] <robertmaxrees> so it doesn't error.
[11:19:09] <Scriptonaut> I can't just run my code, I need to have access to $(this), and I don't know if it will even exist in the first place
[11:19:26] <Scriptonaut> I guess I could find, and then manually check if it exists
[11:19:26] <robertmaxrees> then refactor to not use $(this)
[11:19:31] <robertmaxrees> or do that.
[11:19:35] <robertmaxrees> ccmonster http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/989zy3hr/1/
[11:20:10] <ccmonster> ah yea, that's actually the syntax i was thinking off, not the .prop, but this one
[11:20:23] <ccmonster> that's how i use to do it many moons ago back in like 1.5, 1.4 era when it was introduced
[11:20:36] <robertmaxrees> ccmonster https://api.jquery.com/jquery/ has some good info on that kind of stuff.
[11:20:56] <ccmonster> haha yea, i just didn't know the name of it. was drawing a blank. typically i hit that link
[11:32:53] <ThKo> Good evening guys, is there a way to fire an onclick event $(…).click( function() … before it links to href attribute? Thanks :)
[11:33:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:33:20] <robertmaxrees> you mean before it goes to the next page?
[11:34:06] <ThKo> robertmaxrees: Yep
[11:34:23] <ThKo> So first fire js click function, then go to page xy
[11:34:33] <robertmaxrees> you technically can't.  but you can preventDefault() on the event object, then set window.location
[11:35:36] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0937g13u/ it'd look something like this.
[11:35:37] <ThKo> Maybe a cleaner solution is to ask in pagebeforeshow which button is clicked etc. hmmm
[11:35:50] <ThKo> Ahhhh
[11:35:52] <ThKo> I understand!
[11:35:54] <ThKo> Thanks a lot :)
[11:36:06] <robertmaxrees> yep
[11:36:31] <ThKo> After 12 hours of programming the easiest things seems so difficult :D
[11:36:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd take a break at that point :)
[11:38:14] <ThKo> Maybe it’s better. But time is getting short.
[11:41:52] <jyg> I'm trying to call a .click() on an element I've just added to the DOM. This works on everythign but IE.  http://jsfiddle.net/qqumkdxk/
[11:42:12] <frank_o> ThKo: time is running out
[11:42:27] <jyg> I was wondering if it'd be a problem with events and dynamically added elements
[11:42:35] <jyg> but i'm trying to trigger an event, not listen for one
[11:42:45] <ThKo> frank_o: oh yes...
[11:42:52] <jyg> ... and it works everywhere else but IE. Totally stumped.
[11:43:16] <frank_o> ThKo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOim5kC0nBY classic thanks for the reminder
[11:43:16] <robertmaxrees> jyg any console errors?
[11:43:26] <frank_o> :D
[11:43:35] <jyg> robertmaxrees, none at all
[11:43:49] <jyg> testing with IE11 atm
[11:45:09] <jyg> the download function does complete
[11:45:14] <robertmaxrees> jyg which part specifically doesn't work?  have you tried placing console.log() at various points and seeing if it runs?
[11:45:21] <jyg> yes
[11:45:41] <jyg> all vars are as expected, the download function ends without an error
[11:46:01] <jyg> it's as though the a.click() never occurs/triggers an event
[11:46:42] <ThKo> frank_o: *thumbs up*
[11:56:57] <jyg> wow, nothing I try
[12:38:15] <ThKo> robertmaxrees: Sorry for hightlighting again. I’ve tested your solution but it doesn’t fire…I don’t know why. Have tested it with $(document).ready(…) and without. :)
[12:39:38] <robertmaxrees> ThKo hrm?  i don't remember what your problem was.
[12:39:40] <robertmaxrees> 'sup?
[12:40:03] <ThKo> Sorry ;) It was the problem with fireing click function before href
[12:40:20] <robertmaxrees> are you adding the link after the page laods?
[12:40:21] <robertmaxrees> *loads
[12:41:20] <ThKo> ehm yep, my way: loading page -> checking something on the page -> generating before and after link (on which the click function should work)
[12:41:50] <ThKo> And on click event it should fire a function and AFTER that going to page XY
[12:43:17] <robertmaxrees> then you should use a delegated listener.
[12:43:38] <robertmaxrees> you can only bind to things that exist when you run the bind.  so if you bind when the page loads and the link gets added later, the code won't work.
[12:43:58] <robertmaxrees> instead, do something like $('parent').on('click', 'a', function(){});
[12:44:12] <robertmaxrees> the "parent" should be a parent element that exists on pageload.
[12:44:17] <robertmaxrees> the 'a' is your old selector.
[12:45:01] <ThKo> Ahh ok, thanks a lot I’ll try it
[12:45:38] <robertmaxrees> ThKo read this: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[12:48:21] <ThKo> Ok thanks :)
[13:37:20] <notchris> Can I use offset to calculate the distance of selected menu item from the first menu item?
[13:43:15] <dcope> anyone in here using trunk8.js? i'm having the hardest time getting it to work
[13:48:17] <kevireilly> notchris: probably want to use a mixture of offset, width, and maybe even index
[13:49:17] <notchris> kevireilly: Thx I'll try that
[13:50:00] <kevireilly> notchris: oh, maybe instead of width outerWidth as I think that one includes margins and stuff also
[13:51:03] <notchris> kevireilly: True - I may try to rearrange my menu so that I can use traditional positioning
[14:06:25] <ravigehlot> Something like this is creating line breaks. How do I avoid it from doing so?            this.display.$container.append('<div class="attribution">Uploaded By <a href="' + this.models[0].attributes.source.import_url + '" target="_blank">' + this.models[0].attributes.username + '</a> via ' + this.models[0].attributes.service + '</div>');
[14:10:20] <matgee> is it right that jquery-ui sortable doesn't have an event for when a list item is removed from ul.ui-sortable?
[14:10:35] <matgee> i just tried binding every event according to the api docs, then removed an LI and it never triggered
[14:10:45] <gnarf> matgee with .remove()?
[14:10:54] <matgee> i'm binding to the remove event
[14:10:58] <gnarf> matgee: or like, you drag it to a "trash" thing?
[14:11:03] <matgee> i don't want to actually remove an item
[14:11:08] <matgee> i want to do something when an item is removed
[14:11:18] <gnarf> how is it removed?
[14:11:29] <matgee> .remove()
[14:11:29] <b-ot> matgee: firing because .slideUp() is already executed, though it is still animating
[14:11:42] <matgee> let me make a fiddle ...
[14:11:50] <gnarf> matgee: yeah, thats not going to trigger any events, just trigger your own event
[14:12:02] <gnarf> it's not a user action
[14:12:08] <NoiseEee> 'events' are really about users behaviour with their browser
[14:12:09] <gnarf> you'lll need to wire up an event yourself
[14:12:14] <catuca> Guys, do any of you know why jquery append is creating new line breaks when concatenating?
[14:12:32] <NoiseEee> line breaks?
[14:12:42] <gnarf> catuca: can you make a jsfiddle / jsbin ?
[14:12:49] <catuca> gnarf: sure
[14:14:17] <gnarf> matgee: catuca: I'm afk for a bit - maybe NoiseEee will be nice and help ;)
[14:14:32] <matgee> gnarf i almost have my fiddle ready!
[14:14:39] <gnarf> matgee: you don't need one
[14:14:47] <matgee> i just want you to confirm something
[14:14:51] <gnarf> i can tell you, trigger a "remove" event yourself :)
[14:15:08] <gnarf> if it was like "user drags an item to the "trash"" scenario, there would be an event
[14:15:14] <catuca> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/1skzk0re/
[14:15:38] <gnarf> but if its like "user clicks "x"" scenario, you can trigger your own event inside your click
[14:15:40] <catuca> gnarf: it is not a CSS issue..it is just adding line breaks
[14:16:09] <NoiseEee> catuca: well <div> is a block element
[14:17:08] <catuca> NoiseEee: I am not following you
[14:17:22] <NoiseEee> catuca: block level elements appear on the next 'line'
[14:17:39] <NoiseEee> if you were to append a <span> instead of your <div>, it wouldn't be on another 'line'
[14:17:50] <catuca> NoiseEee: you are right
[14:18:13] <catuca> NoiseEee: so anything else under <div> will inherit block level?
[14:18:16] <gnarf> catuca: you should probably use $('<div class="attribution">').append($('<a target="_blank">').attr('href', href).text(username), ' via ', service);
[14:18:28] <gnarf> ^^^ to get proper escaping in the templated strings
[14:19:00] <NoiseEee> catuca: well it would be a part of the <div>, which would be 'below' any previous element (barring CSS redefining)
[14:19:49] <catuca> NoiseEee: good point, but even wrapped with <span> it doesn't keep it all in one line
[14:20:33] <NoiseEee> catuca: adjust the CSS of the element / parent
[14:20:52] <NoiseEee> catuca: anyways, append() doesn't do 'line breaks', its all about your markup and CSS
[14:21:38] <catuca> NoiseEee: But that is the thing, it is set to 100%, there is no CSS forcing it to be that way
[14:25:44] <NoiseEee> catuca: well too much content will break a line, right?
[14:25:59] <catuca> NoiseEee: I assume so, yes
[14:26:07] <NoiseEee> so...
[14:26:14] <NoiseEee> catuca: perhaps try creating a working fiddle of the problem
[14:26:17] <catuca> NoiseEee: But there is a lot of space there
[14:26:30] <catuca> NoiseeEee: okay
[14:27:25] <NoiseEee> buuuut i'm about to go home, so good luck, presumably someone else can help / you will find your way
[14:29:32] <Scriptonaut> can you use tinysort to sort by date?
[14:35:57] <Otineb> hey guys
[14:36:22] <Otineb> Does anyone have experience calling a function from WITHIN an iFrame?
[14:36:29] <Otineb> it’s kicking my ass
[14:37:46] <__joshua__> you mean calling a function which is scoped in an iframe from outside?
[14:37:49] <Otineb> maybe the question is better suited for /javascript… dunno. the issue I’m finding is that the iframe cuts off access to libraries I need
[14:37:58] <Otineb> @__joshua__
[14:37:59] <Otineb> yea
[14:38:00] <__joshua__> is it same domain?
[14:38:04] <Otineb> it is
[14:38:34] <Otineb> __joshua__: the catch is I don’t have control over very much. I’m working as a prisoner of a really terrible proprietary CMS
[14:38:51] <__joshua__> right. one sec
[14:39:14] <Otineb> __joshua__: here’s a fiddle that has a simplified version of what I’m dealing with. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/5hfhtLsu/2/
[14:39:35] <Otineb> __joshua__: I really appreciate you looking at it.
[14:40:23] <paulvd> hello, i am using .load in jquery to load a different page to a div, it was working before, but now it is not, can anyone tell me what to look for, there is no errors in the div too, when i open that page directly, it works fine
[14:41:06] <kevireilly> paulvd: in what way is it not working now?
[14:42:27] <__joshua__> Otineb: document.getElementById("frmEnterDetails").contentWindow.validateField
[14:43:26] <__joshua__> from parent should access global scope of iframe #frmEnterDetails
[14:43:32] <paulvd> kevireilly: the page doesnt load at all now
[14:43:45] <__joshua__> paulvd: make jsfiddle if you can
[14:44:02] <paulvd> this is the code am using
[14:44:03] <paulvd> http://pastebin.com/3nmx7Sk8
[14:44:07] <paulvd> hmm jsfiddle
[14:44:07] <paulvd> ok
[14:44:12] <kevireilly> paulvd: try to find the network request in the Network tab and inspect it to make sure it is returning content, isn't a 404, and things of that nature
[14:44:53] <Otineb> __joshua__: sweet. Let me try that out
[14:45:21] <paulvd> where's the network tab
[14:45:31] <paulvd> oh saw
[14:45:39] <kevireilly> paulvd: devtools, same thing where you were trying to find errors
[14:45:59] <__joshua__> paulvd:  that site isn't loading for me
[14:46:06] <kevireilly> paulvd: I was going to ask if you're sure there isn't a cross-domain issue, but that should come up as an error in the console
[14:46:28] <paulvd> no, its the same domain
[14:46:35] <paulvd> joshua thats pastebin
[14:47:22] <__joshua__> i mean, http://www.foodchallenges.com/map-container/?id gives error 500, (yes, i didn't give id value)
[14:48:05] <paulvd> joshskidmore_ the value is grabbed from the input field
[14:48:10] <paulvd> http://tinyurl.com/kdtmbh2 this is the original site
[14:49:07] <paulvd> if you go down you will see map search, enter Tampa, FL
[14:49:19] <paulvd> it is supposed to show the loading div till the map loads
[14:49:31] <paulvd> it was working fine before, all of a sudden it has stopped working
[14:50:10] <__joshua__> give me an example of a valid id
[14:50:38] <paulvd> Tampa, FL
[14:50:40] <paulvd> is the ID
[14:50:42] <paulvd> http://tinyurl.com/pgvhljp

[14:57:14] <Tamir> hello.. can some one help me with binding please
[14:57:34] <Tamir> http://pastebin.com/30uDFT6Y
[14:57:47] <Tamir> the question is how to bind $.fn.onBlur function to $(this).blur????
[14:58:35] <paulvd> tried everything sigh, still doesnt work damn
[14:59:21] <Tamir> anyone please?
[15:00:24] <Otineb> @Tamir: $(this).on(‘blur’,function() { //your code });
[15:00:26] <Otineb> ?
[15:00:59] <Tamir> Otineb: is it possible to bind my function not anonymous
[15:01:31] <Tamir> like $(this).on(‘blur’,$.fn.onBlur);
[15:02:24] <Otineb> do you have a fiddle?
[15:03:03] <Tamir> mmm pastebin is not good?
[15:03:11] <Tamir> http://pastebin.com/30uDFT6Y
[15:03:26] <Otineb> www.jsfiddle.net
[15:03:32] <Tamir> ok...
[15:04:09] <Tamir> Otineb: http://jsfiddle.net/0cpuckeu/
[15:05:12] <Otineb> so what are you trying to do? call this function on blur?
[15:05:20] <Tamir> yes
[15:05:38] <Tamir> call $.fn.onBlur on $(this).blur
[15:09:11] <Tamir> any suggestions?
[15:09:37] <paulvd> made a jsfiddle too >> http://jsfiddle.net/d19see91/
[15:11:38] <robertmaxrees> Tamir your question doesn't make any sense.
[15:11:45] <Otineb> Tamir: Gosh man. I’m sorry. You’re doing stuff a bit over my knowledge.
[15:11:52] <Otineb> YES. @robertmaxrees is the man
[15:11:56] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[15:12:01] <robertmaxrees> nah just a nerd ;)
[15:12:11] <Tamir> :)
[15:12:47] <Tamir> if i had function onBlur(){..} then i can bind $(this).blur(onBlur)
[15:13:05] <robertmaxrees> that's how you'd do it.
[15:13:11] <Tamir> but i want to use $.fn.onBlur=function(){...}
[15:13:18] <Tamir> is it not possible?
[15:13:35] <robertmaxrees> $.fn.onBlur extends the jquery object - that's not what you want to do in this case.
[15:13:41] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to write a plugin?
[15:13:51] <Otineb> here’s his fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/0cpuckeu/
[15:13:53] <Tamir> yes kind of
[15:14:20] <robertmaxrees> 1st off that's not how you write an IIFE>
[15:14:51] <Tamir> is it normal to use function somefunction(){}.. instead of $.fn.somefunction?
[15:15:08] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[15:15:18] <robertmaxrees> and unless you're writing a plugin, that's what you should do.
[15:15:30] <Tamir> i have bunch of function something()  functions.. now im trying to to bundle them into kind of plugin
[15:15:48] <Tamir> so code looks nicer...
[15:15:52] <Tamir> :)
[15:16:04] <robertmaxrees> do you want to be able to do $('input').onBlur(someFunction); ?
[15:16:13] <robertmaxrees> explain what you're trying to really do.
[15:16:15] <Tamir> yes
[15:16:28] <robertmaxrees> there's already http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[15:16:39] <Otineb> ah, so he was trying to extend the blur method
[15:16:48] <Otineb> or, that’s what was happening anyway
[15:16:48] <robertmaxrees> maybe?  no clue.
[15:17:33] <Tamir> ok... let me copy the whole code in jsfiddle
[15:17:43] <Tamir> my english is not good enough to explain just here
[15:18:36] <robertmaxrees> we prefer those here anyway :)
[15:19:32] <paulvd> can anyone help me with this?
[15:19:32] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/d19see91/
[15:20:01] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue, paulvd?
[15:20:57] <jquertnoooob> hi guys. i am trying to change the frontend of an existing project. the problem is that stuff that used to work, don't anymore. using firebug, it says "TypeError: $(...).tooltip is not a function" for bootstrap's tooltip
[15:20:58] <paulvd> the .load is not loading the page in that div
[15:21:02] <paulvd> its happening in the live site too
[15:21:13] <robertmaxrees> paul_k because there's no $( "#map-container" ) on the page.
[15:21:47] <jquertnoooob> it does that also for other pluguns such as datetimepicker
[15:21:52] <robertmaxrees> jquertnoooob means you need to load jquery first.
[15:22:00] <robertmaxrees> and that your other plugins aren't loaded.
[15:22:20] <paulvd> ??
[15:22:24] <paulvd> robertmaxrees > <div id="map-container"></div>
[15:22:28] <paulvd> you dont see this?
[15:22:32] <robertmaxrees> ah there it is.
[15:22:41] <robertmaxrees> didn't scroll down.
[15:22:48] <robertmaxrees> my bad.  let me look.
[15:23:07] <robertmaxrees> CORS yo.
[15:23:08] <robertmaxrees> can't do that.
[15:23:40] <paulvd> cant do what?
[15:24:06] <robertmaxrees> you're making a cross-origin ajax request.
[15:24:15] <robertmaxrees> the other server doesn't allow you do do that.
[15:24:29] <jquertnoooob> jquery is loaded at the begining of the page, right after css. the jquery plugins are requested on document ready
[15:24:29] <robertmaxrees> they have to explicitly allow it.
[15:24:52] <robertmaxrees> jquertnoooob you're not loading the plugins before you try to use them.
[15:24:56] <robertmaxrees> load them before document ready.
[15:24:58] <jquertnoooob> jquery is loaded from here <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[15:25:25] <paulvd> robertmaxrees: its not working in the same domain also

[15:28:12] <robertmaxrees> the ajax.
[15:28:23] <robertmaxrees> open your network panel in your dev tools and do the search.
[15:28:25] <robertmaxrees> see the new requesT?
[15:28:44] <paulvd> lemme see
[15:30:31] <paulvd> for this ?
[15:30:31] <paulvd> http://maps.gstatic.com/mapfiles/arrow-down.png
[15:30:48] <robertmaxrees> the ajax request dude
[15:31:02] <paulvd> sorry am poor in handling debugs
[15:31:06] <paulvd> where can i see ajax requests
[15:31:10] <paulvd> i have network tab open
[15:31:13] <robertmaxrees> the network tab of your nev tools.
[15:31:13] <Otineb> @robertmaxrees : do you know a way to use jquery to select an input box within an iFrame? Both frame and window are on the same domain.
[15:31:14] <paulvd> i just see that
[15:31:15] <robertmaxrees> *dev tools
[15:31:27] <Otineb> @robertmaxrees : when you’re done with paul
[15:31:28] <robertmaxrees> paul_k make sure you're not filtering everything out.
[15:31:37] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery contents
[15:31:38] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .contents() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[15:31:42] <robertmaxrees> ^ Otineb check this out.
[15:31:52] <paulvd> filtering?
[15:32:07] <robertmaxrees> paul i don't know what tools you're using so it's hard to guide you.
[15:32:33] <paulvd> robertmaxrees > http://i57.tinypic.com/21dpesm.jpg
[15:32:36] <paulvd> this is all i see
[15:32:40] <paulvd> am using google chromw
[15:32:43] <paulvd> chrome*
[15:32:46] <paulvd> console
[15:34:57] <paulvd> what did you mean by "filter"
[15:36:23] <jquertnoooob> robertmaxrees after looking into it a bit, i see that even though the scripts are loaded, the browser does not recognize tooltip as a function.
[15:37:06] <jquertnoooob> i have entered the following command to the firebug console and the error is the same
[15:37:06] <jquertnoooob> $('.tooltip-demo').tooltip({         selector: "[rel=tooltip]",         container: ".tooltip-demo"     });
[15:38:34] <jquertnoooob> i have commented the sections calling the functions on document ready, and those still do not work when called through console, even though other plugins do work
[15:38:57] <robertmaxrees> paulvd see that luttle funnel looking thing near the cancel icon in the upper lift?
[15:38:59] <robertmaxrees> *left
[15:39:03] <robertmaxrees> jquertnoooob right - the plugins aren't loaded.
[15:39:16] <robertmaxrees> jquertnoooob or you have noconflict mode on.
[15:39:28] <robertmaxrees> try jQuery.fn.tooltip in your console.
[15:40:03] <jquertnoooob> that means i have loaded two versions of jquery?
[15:40:14] <robertmaxrees> that means you have noconflict mode turned on for some reason.
[15:41:15] <jquertnoooob> i have tried    $('.tooltip-demo').jQuery.fn.tooltip({         selector: "[rel=tooltip]",         container: ".tooltip-demo"     });
[15:41:19] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:41:29] <robertmaxrees> jQuery.fn.tooltip
[15:41:33] <robertmaxrees> just that
[15:41:43] <robertmaxrees> literally nothing else.  copy/paste that line into your console and hit enter.
[15:41:45] <jquertnoooob> undefined
[15:41:55] <robertmaxrees> that means the tooltip isn't loadiong.
[15:42:05] <robertmaxrees> *tooltip plugin, rather.
[15:43:09] <robertmaxrees> jquertnoooob check your network tab and make sure the script is actually loading.
[15:44:27] <paulvd> robertmaxrees: yes it asks me to filter something
[15:44:46] <robertmaxrees> paulvd make sure you're on "all" or "xhr"
[15:45:08] <paulvd> i am on all
[15:45:11] <paulvd> xhr shows nothing
[15:45:34] <robertmaxrees> hit the xhr tab, reload the page, and run the search.
[15:46:00] <paulvd> ok
[15:46:54] <jquertnoooob> the scripts are there in both resources tab on chrome and scripts tab on firebug
[15:47:04] <paulvd> this ? >> http://www.foodchallenges.com/map-container/?id=Tampa,&_=1413326765257
[15:47:06] <robertmaxrees> jquertnoooob without any errors?
[15:47:09] <jquertnoooob> i don't see much in the networks tab
[15:47:21] <jquertnoooob> yes
[15:47:35] <robertmaxrees> jquertnoooob then you have something else going on.  are youy loading jquery more than once?
[15:47:52] <jquertnoooob> checking
[15:47:52] <robertmaxrees> paulvd dunno - you tell me.  is that the endpoint you're hitting?>
[15:48:28] <paulvd> do you think the space in Tampa, FL is the issue?
[15:48:47] <robertmaxrees> paul_k i don't know what the issue is.  if your server it throwing 500s, you should look into why.
[15:49:03] <paulvd> i dont see any 500
[15:49:18] <robertmaxrees> let me try again.
[15:49:35] <robertmaxrees> weird now it's working.
[15:49:56] <robertmaxrees> oh i misspelled it the first time.
[15:50:06] <paulvd> http://i58.tinypic.com/4lrngp.jpg
[15:50:08] <paulvd> this is what i see
[15:50:22] <robertmaxrees> i get a 200 if I don't misspell the name
[15:50:47] <jquertnoooob> yes yes yes! robertmaxrees you are the man!
[15:50:56] <jquertnoooob> jquery loaded twice
[15:51:20] <robertmaxrees> jquertnoooob figures.
[15:51:31] <robertmaxrees> paulvd okay.  so your response isn't writing where you want it do?
[15:51:43] <Tamir> its me again...
[15:51:47] <Tamir> http://jsfiddle.net/bv9sp9s0/
[15:52:18] <Tamir> so the question is same :)
[15:52:25] <paulvd> am trying to add - between the words
[15:52:36] <Tamir> $(this).dblclick(function(){
[15:52:37] <Tamir>         $(this).onDblClick();
[15:52:37] <Tamir>     });
[15:52:43] <robertmaxrees> Tamir don't paste into the channel.
[15:52:52] <Tamir> ok
[15:53:09] <Tamir> is it the correct way... or is ther better way to do it?
[15:53:13] <paulvd> how can i remove , from that string
[15:53:25] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript replace text in string
[15:53:25] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: JavaScript String replace() Method - W3Schools → http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_replace.asp
[15:53:39] <robertmaxrees> or this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[15:53:49] <robertmaxrees> Tamir huh?
[15:53:57] <jquertnoooob> Tamir ask again, i will see if i can help
[15:54:02] <Tamir> can you look into the code?
[15:54:04] <robertmaxrees> Tamir don't extend the jquery object if you don't need to.
[15:54:13] <robertmaxrees> you're bloading the jquery object unnecessarily.
[15:54:18] <robertmaxrees> *bloating
[15:55:30] <Tamir> ok so current code is $(this).dblClick(function(){$(this).onDblCLick})... but i would like to have something like $(this).dblClick($.fn.onDblCLick)
[15:55:45] <robertmaxrees> why?
[15:56:12] <robertmaxrees> Tamir have you read the plugin authoring guide?
[15:56:37] <robertmaxrees> if not, i highly suggest starting here: http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[15:57:39] <Tamir> because there is somelogic on dblclick... onDblCLick function binds on focusout... in focusout i might need something else maybe on keypress
[15:57:52] <Tamir> so each event i would like to seperate by function
[15:58:09] <robertmaxrees> Tamir but why as a plugin?
[15:58:35] <Tamir> mmm dont know :) i thought this is the correct way
[15:58:49] <robertmaxrees> there's no reason to make it a plugin.
[15:58:55] <robertmaxrees> use plain event listeners instead.
[15:59:15] <Otineb> @robertmaxrees every time I talk to you my mind gets broadened
[15:59:18] <Otineb> contents()
[15:59:37] <Otineb> excellent stuff
[15:59:38] <Tamir> what do u mean use plain event listeners?
[15:59:52] <robertmaxrees> Tamir $('element').on('event', function() {});
[16:00:09] <robertmaxrees> work with those.  don't extend the jquery object just because.
[16:00:31] <Otineb> yay. that was my original response to him
[16:00:33] <Tamir> like $('.editableText').focus(function(){})
[16:00:42] <Tamir> $('.editableText').focusout(function(){})
[16:00:47] <Tamir> $('.editableText').keypress(function(){})
[16:00:48] <robertmaxrees> .on('focus', function() {});
[16:00:49] <Tamir> so on
[16:00:51] <Tamir> ?
[16:00:53] <robertmaxrees> check out .on() instead.
[16:01:04] <robertmaxrees> all those other methods are shorthand to it.
[16:01:13] <Otineb> $('.editableText’).on(‘keypress’, function(){});
[16:01:16] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:02:38] <Tamir> is it normal? it looks like i have bunch of separate functions such as function f1()...function f2()...function f3()
[16:03:08] <Tamir> i thought i could group all related function into one plugin...
[16:03:15] <checkit> Hey all... I'm writing a quazi plugin/extension and I'm tying to figure out he difference between $.fn.extend() and $.extend(). I've done some ready but still not quit able to put the pieces together. I've built exetensions with $.extend() before.
[16:06:00] <Otineb> does jsfiddle limit which URLs you can use for an iframe?
[16:08:20] <robertmaxrees> Tamir no need to make a plugin - that's totally normal.
[16:08:47] <robertmaxrees> Otineb shouldn't.
[16:08:56] <robertmaxrees> other sites might not like it, though.
[16:09:06] <Tamir> ok thanks for suggestion
[16:09:19] <Otineb> hmm. google.com, yahoo.com dont load in an iframe, Wikipedia, w3schools do…
[16:09:24] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:09:33] <robertmaxrees> probably because google and yahoo don't want to be loaded in iframes.
[16:10:00] <Otineb> my little site also doesnt load… so i wonder where that config is. lol
[16:10:07] <robertmaxrees> the server application.
[16:10:25] <robertmaxrees> in apache/nginx/iis/whatever
[16:10:39] <Otineb> that’s it
[16:13:05] <mlq> Hi! I am sorry, because I guess you get that kind of error pretty often, but I am clueless: http://pastie.org/private/2sy2ejo9fswdhrajzc7wq - At the end I am calling a jquery plugin after the ready event; but the "$ is not defined" error occurs. But, the order of the JS files should be correct and the referenced files exist and are accessible
[16:14:20] <Otineb> @robertmaxrees so your tip on contents() was amazing. I still can’t seem to run a function against something in the iframe though. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/5hfhtLsu/6/
[16:14:30] <Otineb> is there some CORS stuff against this?
[16:14:32] <robertmaxrees> Otineb then the other server won't allow access.
[16:14:33] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:14:50] <Otineb> in production, they are both on the same server
[16:14:57] <Otineb> the parent and the iframe
[16:15:04] <robertmaxrees> no clue then
[16:15:05] <Otineb> originate from the same server/domain
[16:15:12] <robertmaxrees> the server can still block it.
[16:15:36] <robertmaxrees> Otineb do you not see the undefined function?
[16:16:06] <Otineb> i dont…
[16:16:15] <Otineb> console on jsfiddle?
[16:16:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:16:24] <robertmaxrees> validateField is not defined.
[16:16:33] <Otineb> oh
[16:16:38] <Otineb> disregard that
[16:16:40] <Otineb> shouldnt be there
[16:16:43] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:16:50] <robertmaxrees> that'll cause other things to fail, too.
[16:17:04] <Otineb> http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/5hfhtLsu/7/
[16:17:14] <Otineb> in production it’s defined
[16:17:16] <robertmaxrees> still failing.
[16:17:44] <Otineb> man, my console is clean
[16:17:51] <Otineb> nm
[16:17:54] <robertmaxrees> click that field and then click out of it.
[16:17:56] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:17:58] <Otineb> =)
[16:18:48] <Otineb> ok
[16:18:51] <Otineb> refresh that
[16:18:59] <Otineb> also wont be there in production
[16:19:01] <Otineb> =)
[16:23:48] <robertmaxrees> Otineb no clue.  might be tripping up some kind of cors thing, but i'm not sure.
[16:23:56] <Otineb> OR
[16:24:02] <Otineb> I didnt add an ID to the html
[16:24:09] <robertmaxrees> i already tested that part ;)
[16:24:12] <Otineb> ah
[16:24:44] <Otineb> Uncaught SecurityError: Failed to read the 'contentDocument' property from 'HTMLIFrameElement': Blocked a frame with origin "http://fiddle.jshell.net" from accessing a frame with origin “…” Protocols, domains, and ports must match.
[16:24:49] <Otineb> sigh
[16:24:51] <Otineb> ok
[16:26:29] <Otineb> @robertmaxrees well, thanks for looking man
[16:26:38] <robertmaxrees> sure - drop the @ btw.  this isn't twitter ;)\
[16:26:50] <Otineb> #youdarealmvp
[16:26:53] <Otineb> lol
[16:33:32] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: let me ask this. Is there a way to include a library from within a function?
[16:33:50] <robertmaxrees> only in the function?
[16:33:51] <Otineb> if (x=y) {
[16:33:57] <Otineb> the whole library
[16:34:06] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean.
[16:34:37] <Otineb> well the heart my issue is that the function im calling in the iframe depends on an external library (inputMask)
[16:34:37] <robertmaxrees> you can $.getScript() or use any of the module loaders out there to do that.
[16:35:04] <Otineb> when I run code IN the iframe, it has no idea what .mask() means
[16:35:15] <robertmaxrees> right - because .mask() is in a differen scop
[16:35:16] <robertmaxrees> *scope
[16:35:21] <Otineb> and I can’t seem to use contents() to apply that method from the parent
[16:35:23] <robertmaxrees> different copy of jquery entirely.
[16:35:32] <Otineb> right
[16:35:41] <robertmaxrees> let's back up - what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[16:36:00] <robertmaxrees> why are you mucking with iframes like this?
[16:36:24] <Otineb> so i wonder if I can’t pull in the library into the iframe directly. I dont have full control over markup. It’s a shitty proprietary cms that I’m slaved to.
[16:37:06] <Otineb> I can “create javascript snippets” then attach them to a form element (input field) via their gui
[16:37:15] <Otineb> it’s terrible
[16:37:16] <robertmaxrees> that's gross.
[16:37:48] <Otineb> the rendered html puts a “onblur=validatethis()” attribute on the input field
[16:37:53] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:37:55] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[16:37:57] <Otineb> when i inspect that function
[16:38:13] <robertmaxrees> you might be able to use a module loader or some other kind of system to load that code into that scope.
[16:38:20] <Otineb> i get if(curInput=“input-name”) { //my code }
[16:39:23] <Otineb> like requirejs?
[16:39:38] <robertmaxrees> maybe - not sure if that would work though.
[16:40:14] <Otineb> i’ll have to keep banging my head against this
[16:40:18] <Otineb> thanks for everything man
[16:40:23] <robertmaxrees> yeah deffo.
[16:40:40] <Otineb> you’ve set me straight before. you rock
[16:41:16] <robertmaxrees> nah - y'all know what you're doing.
[16:41:23] <Otineb> pshht
[16:41:25] <robertmaxrees> sometimes you just need a finger to point you in the right directly.
[16:41:29] <robertmaxrees> *direction
[16:44:49] <litropy> Within a textarea, are we still disallowing specified characters using an onkeyup script, or is there a better way? The pattern attribute for textarea in HTML5 still isn't supported by Safari, making it useless for my client's purposes.
[16:47:01] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.
[16:47:04] <robertmaxrees> not sure what else you'd do.
[16:51:08] <Robdgreat> am I the only one who thinks smart quote substitution in an irc client is obnoxious?
[16:51:38] <Robdgreat> just sayin'
[16:51:59] <Robdgreat> it's possible. There are a lot of things I find obnoxious that few others do
[16:54:22] <__joshua__> you mean turning " to ' or something?
[16:58:05] <robertmaxrees> probably the "smart" ones that are specially formatte.d
[16:58:46] <Robdgreat> 18:38 [ Otineb] i get if(curInput=“input-name”) { //my code }
[16:58:53] <Robdgreat> if you copied and pasted that, it wouldn't work
[16:58:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[16:59:11] <Robdgreat> but DON'T THEY LOOK SPIFFY
[16:59:13] * Robdgreat rages
[16:59:15] <Robdgreat> ;)
[16:59:16] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[17:14:51] <damasceno> Hello everyone, I'm using Jquery autocomplete but I'm having a problem when I call it from a bootstrap modal. This is what's happening: http://tinypic.com/r/1p9s7c/8, I'm already using AppendTo, this is my CSS: http://pastebin.com/G56Sbi3n, I also changed to absolute, fixex, etc... It happens only once (The first time) then it works fine. Does anyone know thy? Thanks.
[17:56:06] <BeWilled> Hi. I want to use jquery mobile with my drupal website, however this CMS only works with jquery 1.4.4. I see that the latest version of jquery mobile (1.4.4) only works with jquery 1.11.1. What can I do to include this for a specific use case I need on my website?
[18:48:03] <boxatom> So… I am having a issue!  I am using HTML5, and want to use AJAX with jQuery…     I have a form, and i want to submit, and it works, but it does not take into consideration the validations that ive added in html inputs….   any idea how to make jQuery force that html5 validation?
[19:28:11] <aboudreault> I'm trying to select the first option (no value) of a select. Tried many ways without luck. $('select').val(''), $('option[value=""]', 'select).attr('selected', true);
[19:28:18] <aboudreault> any idea what I should use?
[19:30:43] <BillCriswell> $('select').find('option').eq(0).prop('selected', true); maybe?
[19:31:03] <BillCriswell> I kinda feel like $('select').val(''); should work though.
[19:33:45] <aboudreault> BillCriswell, maybe the issue is somewhere else... checking
[19:33:53] <BillCriswell> Ok.

[23:09:07] <BloodyScythe> \o
[23:09:14] <Paradisee> how can i dinamically change an image without refresh the page?
[23:09:37] <BloodyScythe> you may want to change the src
[23:09:46] <Paradisee> ya BloodyScythe, already do
[23:10:17] <BloodyScythe> or load both images and hide one, show the other
[23:10:34] <Paradisee> ill show you the code
[23:10:41] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/0DFP3B6
[23:11:58] <BloodyScythe> isn't it .on("click", function())?
[23:12:06] <Paradisee> this code will change the src link into the json file
[23:12:38] <Paradisee> so i have to make something to show the right image without refresh the page
[23:15:51] <BloodyScythe> is it .attr("src")?
[23:17:09] <Paradisee> should i make a loop?
[23:19:46] <BloodyScythe> no idea... you can wait for someone who knows more about jQ x_x
[23:22:10] <Paradisee> :)
[23:23:14] <sinequanon> rather than a loop, can you just target elements with a certain class?
[23:23:35] <sinequanon> e.g., $('.my-class').attr('src', src);
[23:26:17] <Paradisee> i could, but how will it be able to change the src each time got a click on it? it has to read the json before
[23:27:34] <Cork> Paradisee: when you click the image?
[23:27:39] <Paradisee> ya
[23:27:50] <Cork> create a delegated event handler
[23:28:02] <Cork> and have a data-ref="something" on the image
[23:28:04] <Paradisee> uh?
[23:28:10] <Cork> use that key to map into the json
[23:28:11] <Paradisee> https://bitbucket.org/Paradisee/pydomotic/src
[23:28:18] <Paradisee> here the repo, so you can check the code
[23:28:28] <Paradisee> isn't upgraded, but almost
[23:29:11] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'img.dyn', function(event) { $(this).prop('src', json[$(this).data('ref')]); });
[23:30:12] <Paradisee> will it change each time i click on the element?
[23:30:42] <Cork> not that specific code
[23:31:04] <Cork> you would need a way to separate the two states
[23:31:12] <Cork> like a class on the img
[23:31:17] <Paradisee>  actually i can't try the code cus im at work, so probably ill ask the same question when im going to work on it
