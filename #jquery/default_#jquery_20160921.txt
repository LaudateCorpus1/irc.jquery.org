[00:24:34] <Enerel> does Ajax requested content is considered as DYNAMIC?
[00:25:17] <bomb> Why are you shouting?
[00:25:40] <Enerel> i am not actually. bomb why are you always drunk
[00:27:53] <Enerel> can i ask bootstrap questions here?
[00:28:50] <bomb> Sure. Nobody will answer, though.
[00:29:37] <Enerel> bootstrap editable dynamic content i have a problem
[00:29:40] <bomb> I'd try ##bootstrap
[00:29:50] <Enerel> tried no channel exist
[00:30:07] <bomb> There are 175 people on that channel right now.
[00:30:22] <bomb> You missed a hash maybe.
[00:30:23] <Enerel> i see now
[00:30:27] <Enerel> yes
[00:30:31] <Enerel> thanks bomb
[00:30:45] <bomb> Welcome.
[00:31:11] <Enerel> give me a hug
[00:33:18] <Enerel> no one is answering
[00:33:22] <Enerel> what happened?
[00:35:29] <bomb> You should be patient on the IRC.
[00:35:39] <bomb> Sometimes it would take more than a day to get an answer.
[00:35:55] <Enerel> how long are you waiting here
[00:36:16] <bomb> You better download a client like Hexchat if you're planning to mess around here.
[00:37:10] <Enerel> i have not done nothing bad, you racist
[00:38:52] <bomb> Tavuk.

[04:50:51] <arnas> hi
[04:50:59] <arnas> https://jsfiddle.net/cLnhxgo6/2/ how can I make popup appear when I click on show span?
[07:53:17] <desnudopenguino> I've got a dynamic drop-down form being built by json, trying to figure out how to remove the dom elements after the current one when it changes
[07:54:08] <Cork> desnudopenguino: simplest is prob to build the new dropdown list content and replace all of the old ones
[07:54:27] <Cork> you want to batch up dom modifications as much as possible
[07:54:32] <desnudopenguino> i've got a data-level field that tracks the current level of depth in the drop downs, and try to remove the select elements if they are > the current one using the each() function, but it leaves the last element usually
[07:55:17] <Cork> desnudopenguino: why not control it by css?
[07:55:31] <Cork> sibling and child selectors should be able to make it hidden
[07:56:24] <desnudopenguino> I could do that as well, but how would I detect the active inputs vs inactive ones on submit?
[07:58:07] <Cork> several ways
[07:58:37] <Cork> you could stip out inputs that is empty, or you could add a class on the element when the user changes it
[08:00:40] <desnudopenguino> true
[08:01:16] <desnudopenguino> hrm thanks Cork! back to the grindstone
[08:10:35] <Viddax> I have created:
[08:10:36] <Viddax> data-delete-request="ajax:get"
[08:10:36] <Viddax> data-delete-request-url="/feature/delete"
[08:10:56] <Viddax> to perform ajax request when clicking on a delete button
[08:11:28] <Viddax> I am thinking how to create another data attrabute for sucesss
[08:12:07] <Viddax> for  success: function (data) { .. }
[08:12:23] <Viddax> How about?
[08:12:24] <Viddax> success:ClassOrIdName
[08:12:24] <Viddax> successCallBack:functionName
[08:13:08] <Viddax> data-delete-success-type="callback:functionName"
[08:13:21] <Viddax> data-delete-success-type="selector:className"
[08:13:28] <Viddax> What do you suggest?
[08:19:37] <lilalinux> I need some help with ajax file upload
[08:20:16] <lilalinux> I already have the data to transfert, but when I set processData:false, only the string [object Object] is transferred
[08:21:26] <lilalinux> oh, do I need FormData instead of an ordinary object?
[09:55:07] <taplar> Viddax: personally I wouldn't put callback logic on elements
[09:55:25] <taplar> your mixing your markup and your language at that point
[09:56:17] <taplar> lilalinux: for a file upload, from my experience, ya, you need a FormData element
[09:56:38] <lilalinux> taplar: yes, it works fine with FormData
[11:00:06] <lilalinux> How can I do remove the current page from history and do a history.back()?
[11:06:49] <dddh_> you can try window.location.replace(document.referrer)
[11:07:47] <dddh_> lilalinux: document.referrer should be previous history entry and window.location.replace doesn't save current location in history
[11:08:01] <lilalinux> dddh_: thank you
[11:09:35] <tocka> hi guys, how can I remove all divs from <body> except from one <div> and its contents?

[11:20:39] <jose3__> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d8587610e84632f4ea9f28c31b4a3031 what is wrong here? I am trying to delete the emails in array one from array 2. I believe that it is working but it is forever changing the original array. Also, when you run it multiple times it keeps finding new results
[11:20:44] <BulleTTime> hi, im using jquery ajax in a interval, but sometimes i see a error ¨net::ERR_NETWORK_IO_SUSPENDED¨ . anyone knows why?
[11:29:34] <rddd> Hi there, I've replaced a div on my page with $('#div').load('just_a_table.html') - but I can't seem to get any selectors to work to get the <tbody> from that dynamically added table... how can I append <tr>s to the <tbody> if the table wasn't static on the page?
[11:30:37] <rddd> 've been googling for too long and can only find people trying t o attach event listeners, which isn't what I want
[11:30:43] <rddd> *I've
[11:37:11] <jose3__> how are you selecting?
[11:37:29] <jose3__> is it because the selctors occur before the dom element is there?
[11:38:12] <al-damiri> What's the show/hide event for an element? (Like an event when a <div> is shown and hidden etc.)
[11:39:16] <jose3__> .show() ?
[11:39:48] <al-damiri> jose3__: is that an event I can bind on ? $('#my-div').on('show', function() { ... }) ?
[11:40:14] <al-damiri> doesn't seems to be working for me and I couldn't find anything related in the docs either.
[11:54:51] <taplar> show/hide is not an event
[11:56:47] <Uhkis> al-damiri: if you're using jquerys show()/hide(), you can use the callback function to trigger an event
[12:32:00] <jose3__> why does my code change registrantData and not registeredMinusAbandoned ?
[12:35:34] <taplar> got a fiddle?
[12:52:38] <mmmveggies> So will `$(function() { })` execute immediately if the document is already ready?
[12:52:44] <mmmveggies> or will it just not execute at all
[12:52:49] <taplar> immediately
[12:54:30] <jose3__> how can I make a call like this: var locationInRegistrantList = registeredMinusAbandoned.indexOf(abandonedGuests[i]['Contact.Email']);
[12:54:46] <jose3__> where locationInRegistrantList is an array of objects
[12:54:57] <jose3__> as of now locationInRegistrantList will always be -1
[12:55:06] <robertmaxrees> jose3__ you mean you always want the contact emails?
[12:55:46] <jose3__> I have 2 datasets, both of them contain emails. I want to remove every email in dataset B from dataset A
[12:55:59] <taplar> fiddle
[12:56:08] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[12:56:48] <robertmaxrees> jose3__ long story short, you'll want to use a filter, but it'll be kind of convoluted.
[12:57:08] <robertmaxrees> there's one way to do it but i'm interested to see what your data formats are.
[12:57:41] <taplar> we can only guess what the format is by your code.  but since your code is not working.... :)
[12:59:19] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[12:59:51] <jose3__> i will pull something together
[13:00:18] <robertmaxrees> long story short, I'd map out the email addresses from list B, and then do your indexOf() check within a filter for list A
[13:00:26] <taplar> should be able to do a console.log of the related element before that logic to see what you can pull out to put in the fiddle
[13:01:29] <taplar> worst case stringify it for easy copy
[13:01:29] <robertmaxrees> $
[13:10:04] <jose3__> ok
[13:10:07] <jose3__> https://jsfiddle.net/41z7Ljq9/
[13:10:13] <jose3__> I believe this is basically what I have
[13:10:32] <robertmaxrees> btw no need for body tags in jsfiddle.
[13:10:38] <taplar> var registeredMinusAbandoned = registrantData; <-- not defined
[13:10:39] <jose3__> In my live version it seems to work the first time, however when you keep running it it keeps lowering the number
[13:11:13] <taplar> ah, it's below it.  i forget if that matters
[13:11:21] <robertmaxrees> so you want to remove all abandonedGuests from registrantData ?
[13:11:31] <jose3__> yes
[13:11:41] <jose3__> so in this example -1
[13:11:44] <robertmaxrees> so basically, don't use for loops.
[13:12:12] <robertmaxrees> also: are you in control of this data format?
[13:12:23] <mmmveggies> thx taplar
[13:13:12] <jose3__> not really
[13:13:17] <robertmaxrees> that's too bad.
[13:13:21] <robertmaxrees> this is a really bad format :(
[13:13:23] <jose3__> to what extent?
[13:13:47] <robertmaxrees> 'Contact.Email' is a terrible prob name.
[13:14:02] <taplar> i'm a little concerned that the ids don't match
[13:14:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah that's a little jank, too.
[13:14:11] <taplar> between the two shared emails
[13:14:51] <robertmaxrees> what's this being used for?
[13:15:06] <jose3__> a report
[13:15:14] <jose3__> seeing which people are not coming basically
[13:15:20] <jose3__> despite having signed up
[13:15:29] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[13:15:44] <robertmaxrees> either way, do a map to get the abandoned emails, then a filter from there
[13:15:44] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/41z7Ljq9/3/
[13:15:47] <robertmaxrees> something like this.
[13:17:46] <jose3__> you are a wizard
[13:18:41] <robertmaxrees> js101
[13:18:50] <robertmaxrees> if you use a for loop, you're doing it wrong.
[13:19:19] <jose3__> why?
[13:19:36] <robertmaxrees> for loops are great if you want to repeat something x number of times.
[13:19:42] <robertmaxrees> that's rarely what you actually want to do.
[13:19:54] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/41z7Ljq9/4/ my take
[13:19:58] <robertmaxrees> instead, ask the language to do something for you.
[13:22:07] <decx> next time reduce your map into a string taplar
[13:22:22] <taplar> which part?
[13:22:42] <decx> the part where you loop
[13:22:44] <decx> ^^
[13:23:13] <taplar> the filter or find?
[13:23:29] <robertmaxrees> decx the loop isn't his :)
[13:23:32] <decx> i would have to read the rest
[13:23:47] <decx> but it looks so... cramped
[13:24:48] <decx> so output all registered emails that arent in abandoned i take it?
[13:24:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:25:12] <robertmaxrees> or all users.
[13:25:14] <robertmaxrees> either/or.
[13:26:26] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/41z7Ljq9/5/ :P
[13:27:49] <taplar> but again, the ids concern me
[13:29:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:29:11] <robertmaxrees> the data format in general is janky.
[13:29:51] <taplar> heh, like 'Contact.' is unnecessary.  there isn't anything else that's different
[13:29:58] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[13:31:42] <decx> probably pulled wrong
[13:32:00] <decx> stringified a contact object and then tried to put it back together
[13:49:37] <catbadger> what's the best free jquery graphicng library?
[13:49:40] <catbadger> graphing
[13:49:48] <jbailey> kwrite
[13:49:53] <jbailey> whoops
[13:50:11] <catbadger> no
[13:50:12] <catbadger> lol
[13:50:20] <catbadger> kate > kwrite
[13:50:26] <robertmaxrees> dj is a really popular choice
[13:50:35] <catbadger> thanks rmr!
[13:51:02] <robertmaxrees> nvd3 is a good library that uses d3
[13:51:30] <catbadger> I usesd canvasjs for a project that has a paywall, and now i need to find a free one :P
[13:52:30] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:52:58] <catbadger> client thinks the license is too steep
[13:53:26] <robertmaxrees> i could see that
[13:53:46] <catbadger> yeah but that's how development economy works
[13:54:07] <catbadger> :) thanks rmr
[13:54:17] <jbailey> I have a page whose menu performs a $("#content").load("content.php?topic=stuff") when clicked on. Often times the result of the .load is a web form, that, when submitted, points back to content.php and should show results only in the #content div. Unfortunately, my jQuery event handler doesn't seem to be seeing the submit event of the form in the #content div, so when the submit does happen, the results don't appear just in #content, but take the
[13:54:17] <jbailey> entire page. It's like the new content from .load doesn't honor any of my js or css declarations. Is there a better way to go about this?
[13:54:46] <robertmaxrees> jbailey sure - only load the specific form and then use a delegated event listener.
[13:55:20] <jbailey> Should I be using something different than .load to begin with?
[13:55:41] <robertmaxrees> well, the first question I'd ask is "why use ajax in the first place?"
[13:56:23] <catbadger> @jbailey got a fiddle?
[13:56:34] <robertmaxrees> really no need for a fiddle tbh.
[13:56:58] <catbadger> my thought is that there's multiple #content divs
[13:57:06] <robertmaxrees> it has nothing to do with that ;)
[13:57:06] <taplar> dynamic content with bindings
[13:57:12] <catbadger> oh
[13:57:15] <taplar> thus roberts delegate suggestion
[13:57:20] <catbadger> yees
[13:57:22] <catbadger> ok
[13:57:23] <robertmaxrees> he's pulling in dynaminc content, but his event handlers aren't working becuase they've already run.
[13:57:24] <jbailey> There's only one #content div at any given time. The only thing that changes is the contents of the #content div
[13:57:27] * catbadger goes back to debugging
[13:57:47] <robertmaxrees> jbailey http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:57:53] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[13:58:00] <robertmaxrees> these two links should give you a good place to start.
[13:58:14] <robertmaxrees> also: does that endpoint only serve up the form with no other html?
[13:59:02] <jbailey> correct. I'm building a frontend to a custom database, so I have index.php that loads the site as a whole, and then content.php that controls the content in the #content div
[13:59:19] <robertmaxrees> heh, so then yeah.  you just need to use event delegation.
[13:59:33] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're not including scripts within that content and you're fine.
[14:10:23] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeeee
[14:10:30] <taplar> :)
[14:10:56] <roflmyeggo> best way to pass an array as arguments using each() iterating over an array?
[14:11:03] <robertmaxrees> wut
[14:11:07] <roflmyeggo> ^_^
[14:11:14] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn't use each for that.
[14:11:25] <roflmyeggo> to parse the array as arguments like with apply()
[14:11:36] <robertmaxrees> still not making sense
[14:12:00] <roflmyeggo> i have an array of arrays, each subarray should be parsed as arguments and passed to an anonymous function using each()
[14:12:16] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to use jquery's each?
[14:12:29] <roflmyeggo> robertmaxrees: can you suggest a better way? :)
[14:12:42] <robertmaxrees> the native forEach()?
[14:13:10] <robertmaxrees> theArray.forEach(function(currentArray) { someFunction.apply(this, currentArray) });
[14:13:14] <roflmyeggo> robertmaxrees: good call
[14:13:20] <robertmaxrees> pretty easy stuff.
[14:13:30] <roflmyeggo> i agree
[14:13:38] <taplar> if for some reason you absolutely wanted to use jquery for that, $.each instead of $(array).each
[14:13:38] <roflmyeggo> thanks for the nudge in the right direction
[14:13:46] <robertmaxrees> sure/
[14:13:51] <roflmyeggo> taplar: i was using $.each
[14:13:54] <taplar> k
[14:14:08] <roflmyeggo> but then each argument is still passed as an array, not as a number of arguments
[14:14:27] <roflmyeggo> i wasnt sure of the best method to split each array into arguments in that case
[14:14:32] <robertmaxrees> regardless of how you're enumerating, you'd use .apply() still.
[14:14:41] <robertmaxrees> just within that foreach
[14:15:01] <jbailey> Interesting. So I had $(#content).on('submit' set to run a function, but the function never gets loaded.
[14:15:02] <roflmyeggo> robertmaxrees: yeah that was the path i was heading down..
[14:15:20] <robertmaxrees> jbailey yeah, just need to make that delegated instead.
[14:15:24] <taplar> jbailey: you read any of that delegate documentation?
[14:15:37] <jbailey> I did, but apparently I'm missing something
[14:15:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:15:48] <robertmaxrees> did you skip to the first example in the docs?
[14:15:53] <roflmyeggo> $.each(myArray, (function() { // do something }).apply( // what goes here? ));
[14:16:06] <taplar> wha?
[14:16:16] <taplar> your apply would be inside that method in the each
[14:16:17] <robertmaxrees> that's... not valid code roflmyeggo
[14:16:25] <robertmaxrees> roflmyeggo i already showed you an example.
[14:16:27] <roflmyeggo> taplar: ah okay
[14:16:28] <jbailey> I read through it, but I'll read through it again.
[14:16:34] <robertmaxrees> jbailey you skipped to the first example on the docs.
[14:16:36] <robertmaxrees> look at the second on.
[14:16:45] <roflmyeggo> robertmaxrees: yeah, im going to go with forEach, but now im just curious
[14:16:49] <robertmaxrees> $('parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[14:16:58] <robertmaxrees> roflmyeggo you're use each almost the same way...
[14:17:25] <roflmyeggo> i understand now that you said to put the apply inside the function
[14:17:26] <roflmyeggo> thanks :D
[14:17:32] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:19:51] <roflmyeggo> theArray.forEach(function(currentArray) { (function() { // do something }).apply(this, currentArray) });
[14:20:00] <robertmaxrees> wat
[14:20:03] <taplar> apply inside dude
[14:20:04] <robertmaxrees> why are you passing an iife?
[14:20:20] <roflmyeggo> hah
[14:20:31] <taplar> also, fwiw 'this' and currentArray would be the same thing
[14:20:55] <roflmyeggo> i just changed robertmaxrees code to an anonymous function instead
[14:21:08] <robertmaxrees> mine still uses an anonymous function...
[14:21:13] <robertmaxrees> why are you creating a function within a function?
[14:21:35] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/0956531d4d05
[14:21:49] <roflmyeggo> what if i wanted to perform some operations not defined in a function yet
[14:21:51] <taplar> no reason to bind to an anonymous function
[14:22:08] <robertmaxrees> taplar sure, he could pass anything there.
[14:22:16] <robertmaxrees> roflmyeggo then you do it before you call the other function...
[14:22:25] <roflmyeggo> i mean i could
[14:22:25] <taplar> he's re-creating the funciton every time
[14:22:27] <taplar> in his example
[14:22:37] <taplar> in your snipplet, sure
[14:22:37] <roflmyeggo> but im trying to convince myself why i cant do it
[14:22:38] <robertmaxrees> right, which he's not doing any more.
[14:22:43] <robertmaxrees> roflmyeggo can't do what?
[14:23:01] <roflmyeggo> why you cant replace "someFunction" with an anymous function and call apply on it?
[14:23:16] <robertmaxrees> why would you do that in the first place?
[14:23:20] <robertmaxrees> that's an unreadable mess.
[14:23:24] <robertmaxrees> and is totally unnecessarily.
[14:23:26] <robertmaxrees> *unnecessary
[14:23:28] <roflmyeggo> im just curious for learning purposes
[14:23:37] <robertmaxrees> you CAN do it, but it's a bad idea.
[14:23:39] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't make sense to.
[14:23:48] <roflmyeggo> oh, okay ^_^
[14:23:58] <roflmyeggo> im happy now then :D
[14:24:06] <robertmaxrees> creating an iife inside an anonymous function makes little sense.
[14:24:21] <taplar> DRY
[14:24:35] <roflmyeggo> okay cool
[14:24:37] <robertmaxrees> you use an IIFE when you want a one-time-use scope - all functions create scope, so using an IIFE there doesn't really matter since you;ve already got scope.
[14:24:38] <roflmyeggo> i still have lots to learn
[14:24:45] <robertmaxrees> plus naming functions is p. neat.
[14:25:07] <roflmyeggo> robertmaxrees: thanks, that helps a lot
[14:29:56] <codecutter> which event if appropiate for search suggestion? I have a search field that should query server (ajax) when there is char input\
[14:30:19] <robertmaxrees> input
[14:30:22] <codecutter> i'm not sure which event i use for this?
[14:30:23] <robertmaxrees> debounced.
[14:30:27] <robertmaxrees> the input event
[14:30:39] <codecutter> not keyup?
[14:30:48] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use keyup personally.
[14:30:53] <robertmaxrees> input makes more sense imo.
[14:31:01] <codecutter> whats debounced?
[14:31:08] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript debounce
[14:31:13] <robertmaxrees> b-ooooot
[14:31:31] <robertmaxrees> basically waits to fire the handler until after the user is done.
[14:31:49] <codecutter> is that what input does?
[14:31:53] <merkazu> is there a way to check if both items obtained by a selector has a specific class or do you need to run two separate selections and compare the two?
[14:32:21] <merkazu> right now, i've got $('[data-lesson-id="108"], [data-lesson-id="109"]').hasClass('completed') but it's giving me true if one of the two has it
[14:32:24] <merkazu> not only both
[14:36:01] <taplar> $('.completed').filter('[data-lesson-id="108"], [data-lesson-id="109"]').length === 2
[14:37:17] <taplar> avoid attribute selectors.  they can result in a dom scan
[14:37:18] <jbailey> robertmaxrees ....  http://pastebin.com/YkgtRMLr
[14:42:02] <merkazu> wow! thanks taplar, i'll look up what dom scans mean and how that'll reflect on performance
[14:42:38] <taplar> a dom scan is where the selector has to look at every element in the dom to see if it matches
[14:42:49] <taplar> an attribute can potentially be on any element
[14:43:10] <taplar> where as tags/classes/ids are handled specially by the browser for fast lookup
[14:43:14] <taplar> they are meant for lookups
[14:49:41] <igcewieling> I'm trying to test for the existence of a child element with a class .bw  I'm a noob, but I still should be able to get this to work:  https://jsfiddle.net/a5ouhc6h/2/
[14:50:20] <taplar> https://api.jquery.com/has/
[14:53:11] <catbadger> if ( parent_element.find(child_selector).length > 0) {}
[14:53:59] <igcewieling> taplar: like this?     if ($(this).has('.bw')) {  or     if ($(this).children(). has('.bw')) {  neither appears to work on that fiddle. https://jsfiddle.net/a5ouhc6h/4/
[14:54:16] <igcewieling> catbadger: that looks easy.  I'll give it a try.
[14:54:19] <taplar> $(this).has('.bw').length
[14:54:40] <notchris> Hello all, I have a function that should return an array. If I log the array within the function it works, otherwise it is undefined, not sure why.
[14:54:42] <notchris> https://jsfiddle.net/notchris/2ykuoqmz/1/
[14:55:24] <taplar> notchris: your doing an ajax call
[14:55:28] <taplar> it can't 'return'
[14:55:32] <notchris> Ahh
[14:56:17] <notchris> Hmm
[14:57:08] <Justice> ofc ajax can return
[14:57:19] <taplar> not out of a function
[14:57:38] <igcewieling> thanks catbadger and taplar, that helped.
[14:57:40] <notchris> So I cant call that function to do an ajax call and return a created array?
[14:57:40] <taplar> you have to either attach a then() or something to the deferred, or call a method from one of the callbacks
[14:57:48] <Justice> taplar: with promise
[14:57:50] <notchris> Ah
[14:57:51] <taplar> ^ see my last statement
[14:58:06] <catbadger> igcewieling np
[14:58:10] <Justice> you can return a promise from an ajax call
[14:58:24] * catbadger starts code review
[14:58:32] <Justice> then promise.then(func....)
[14:58:37] <Justice> on some other part
[14:59:19] <Justice> creating ajax promise arrays is awesome though
[14:59:36] <Justice> and using $.when(promise1,promise2, etc.
[15:06:08] <catbadger> promises work well with defers
[15:06:26] <taplar> kinda the whole point, :)
[15:08:31] * catbadger nods. I just mentioned it because i only saw mention of promise and not of defer. I just think it's important for newbs to grasp the whole concept
[15:08:42] * catbadger goes back to debugging
[15:18:23] <codecutter> i'm trying to get the debounce function to work with twitter flight (framework) http://pastebin.com/LFw8Mt2R
[15:18:43] <codecutter> Have a look at Tom Hamshere comments at this post https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/twitter-flight/debounce%7Csort:relevance/twitter-flight/ciXpbe_zpic/FhFhW9g1LrQJ
[15:18:54] <codecutter> following his example
[15:20:08] <codecutter> utils.js:186 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'apply' of undefined
[15:20:19] <codecutter> maybe i'm doing it wrong?
[15:21:42] <codecutter> any suggestions?
[15:43:55] <codecutter> Timer does not work on the second http://pastebin.com/hxrF07uY
[15:47:02] <codecutter> got it
[15:49:41] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/kuqse7sg/
[15:49:51] <hellyeah> why that gave me same number for top and left?
[15:51:02] <codecutter> robertmaxrees: how long should the timer be for debounce?
[15:51:27] <codecutter> i have it set to 250, would the be enough?
[15:51:34] <codecutter> that*
[15:53:41] <jose3__> ok
[15:53:44] <codecutter> anyone?
[15:53:50] <jose3__> I think i finally got it setup
[15:54:00] <jose3__> thanks folks
[15:56:12] <taplar> hellyeah: body typically has some default margin associated with it
[15:56:25] <hellyeah> well boy is 8px at top and left
[15:56:33] <hellyeah> wondering is it always the case
[15:56:34] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/kuqse7sg/2/
[15:57:09] <hellyeah> when i do position:absolute of div there it report 20 at top 30 at left
[15:57:25] <hellyeah> i guess it will be focused on body tag at starting point
[15:57:28] <robertLunch> ewww
[15:57:32] <robertLunch> console pls :(
[15:57:57] <hellyeah> if i do position:relative it will be focucused on html tag as starting point
[15:57:59] <taplar> hellyeah: right, absolute position lets you put it where ever
[15:58:09] <taplar> relative is from it's initial position
[15:58:11] <hellyeah> robertLunch:   i am sorry i will do it next time
[15:58:21] <hellyeah> just give me a sec
[15:58:52] <taplar> position relative with top and left of 0 makes no change.  though it lets you set the z-index
[15:59:04] <taplar> position aboslute with top and left 0 puts it in the top left corner
[16:00:53] <taplar> position relative also makes children with nested positions relate to it, and not the body
[16:01:04] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/kuqse7sg/3/
[16:01:31] <taplar> none of your rules are for the body dude
[16:01:35] <hellyeah> ops
[16:01:36] <taplar> why would it change?
[16:01:39] <hellyeah> a sec
[16:02:20] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/kuqse7sg/5/
[16:02:22] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/kuqse7sg/4/
[16:03:33] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/kuqse7sg/6/
[16:03:51] <hellyeah> well i dont know i will do webscrapping
[16:03:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:04:10] <hellyeah> i will check the position of elements
[16:04:15] <taplar> i don't understand the question, if there is one
[16:04:28] <hellyeah> i dont know how it works out that the idea of my frşend
[16:04:40] <taplar> ?
[16:04:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:04:47] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:04:47] <hellyeah> sorry
[16:05:35] <hellyeah> well there is question
[16:05:41] <hellyeah> some position is double
[16:05:44] <hellyeah> why is that?
[16:05:55] <hellyeah> do i need to parse to int?
[16:06:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:06:19] <robertmaxrees> in javascript, there are only numbers - no "double", "float", "int" etc.
[16:06:32] <hellyeah> okey but
[16:06:37] <hellyeah> this is double right 50.000003814697266
[16:06:41] <taplar> Number
[16:06:47] <robertmaxrees> that's a number.
[16:06:51] <robertmaxrees> all js numbers are numbers.
[16:07:07] <hellyeah> but it is double number right
[16:07:12] <robertmaxrees> in js?
[16:07:16] <hellyeah> normally
[16:07:27] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:07:31] <hellyeah> anyway i understand
[16:07:34] <robertmaxrees> why does that matter?
[16:07:38] <taplar> are you saying top() is Number but css('top') is '#px'?
[16:07:39] <hellyeah> but still i need to use Number i guess
[16:08:00] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:08:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:08:05] <taplar> i'm still not understanding the question
[16:08:13] <hellyeah> for example i didtop:50px;   left:70px;
[16:08:21] <taplar> ya
[16:08:21] <hellyeah> for div2 but if you check the console
[16:08:31] <hellyeah> it is not 50 it something "double"
[16:08:35] <hellyeah> not the same number
[16:08:40] <hellyeah> wonder the reason of that
[16:08:45] <taplar> it's relative man
[16:08:59] <hellyeah> the other one is exact position :D
[16:09:06] <taplar> right
[16:09:23] <taplar> relative is take where you start off and adjust by this
[16:09:29] <taplar> aboslute is no adjustment, go here
[16:09:32] <hellyeah> oket position:relative doesnt give you exact number we can make sense like that
[16:09:46] <hellyeah> understand
[16:10:07] <hellyeah> well is there a method for checking element's position is relative or absolute?
[16:10:17] <taplar> css('position')
[16:10:18] <robertmaxrees> .css('position')
[16:10:19] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:10:22] <taplar> :)
[16:10:56] <robertmaxrees> something tells me there's some missing foundational knowledge here.
[16:12:43] <taplar> idk why you'd need to know that though
[16:12:51] <robertmaxrees> he's confused.
[16:12:53] <robertmaxrees> imo
[16:14:06] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  sincerely saying that, no one around me at work knows that stuff
[16:14:10] <hellyeah> js/jquery
[16:14:21] <hellyeah> and i am little bit rusty tbh
[16:14:27] <hellyeah> sorry for easy question
[16:14:31] <robertmaxrees> none of what your'e asking about really has anything to do with javascript fwiw.
[16:14:34] <robertmaxrees> it's all CSS related.
[16:15:06] <hellyeah> hmm it is css yes thanks for helping me nevertheless
[16:15:17] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am working on project with my friend
[16:15:21] <robertmaxrees> and it's not that they're easy questions
[16:15:27] <robertmaxrees> it's that the questions don't really make sense.
[16:15:30] <hellyeah> my friend gave me the idea for working on it
[16:16:01] <hellyeah> he wants to know x and y position of a div
[16:16:25] <taplar> y?
[16:16:53] <hellyeah> y?
[16:17:01] <hellyeah> coordinate system
[16:17:07] <hellyeah> x and y coordinates
[16:17:48] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:18:52] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:19:56] <hellyeah> guessing what div is for in a page. actually i dont know clearly
[16:20:00] <hellyeah> i am really confused
[16:20:01] <hellyeah> .d
[16:20:10] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:20:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:20:13] <robertmaxrees> welcome to the club :)
[16:20:18] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to accomplish here?
[16:21:15] <hellyeah> we will do web scraping
[16:21:19] <robertmaxrees> okay
[16:21:38] <hellyeah> and we will gues what div can be for by looking at its position
[16:21:49] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:21:50] <hellyeah> it is what i understood
[16:21:58] <robertmaxrees> that won't work the way you think it will, but OK.
[16:22:09] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i am just digging
[16:22:20] <robertmaxrees> i am just replying?
[16:22:20] <taplar> are you going to be webscraping in a browser?
[16:22:28] <hellyeah> taplar:  yes
[16:22:40] <taplar> so it's not going to be automated
[16:22:48] <robertmaxrees> what kind of information are you collecting, btw?
[16:22:53] <hellyeah> what do you mean "automated"
[16:23:02] <taplar> it was soccer stuff iirc
[16:23:16] <robertmaxrees> aren't there APIs for that?
[16:23:18] <hellyeah> taplar:  it is one of example taplar
[16:23:24] <hellyeah> we are at very beginning
[16:23:44] <hellyeah> it is for learning purposes robertmaxrees
[16:23:53] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:23:55] <hellyeah> we will use phantomjs, nodejs, express
[16:24:14] <hellyeah> there is no APU we just want to do manually
[16:24:29] <hellyeah> we will do project for learning technologies
[16:24:29] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:24:39] <taplar> does phantomjs work with positions?
[16:24:39] <robertmaxrees> i hate that rationale.
[16:24:48] <robertmaxrees> phantomjs can render things taplar
[16:24:52] <taplar> huh
[16:24:54] <hellyeah> you can write js in phantomjs
[16:25:00] <robertmaxrees> it's a headless browser.
[16:25:01] <taplar> i figured headless would ignore that stuff
[16:25:09] <hellyeah> page.evaluate
[16:25:24] <hellyeah> inside this function you can write javascript/jquery code
[16:25:55] <hellyeah> if i am not mistaken page.evaluate will bring the dom for processing with js/jquery
[16:26:03] <taplar> no clue
[16:26:06] <robertmaxrees> *JS
[16:26:09] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS js.
[16:26:14] <robertmaxrees> so it's redundant to say both over and over.
[16:26:48] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  keep it in my mind
[16:26:58] <fancyfetus> Hey guys
[16:27:09] <fancyfetus> I'm trying to make a get request using jquery.ajax
[16:27:29] <fancyfetus> I want to encode some params into the URI string though
[16:27:36] <fancyfetus> One of the params is an array
[16:27:42] <fancyfetus> http://pastebin.com/XGDxVHRj
[16:27:47] <robertmaxrees> yuck pastebin
[16:27:52] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees, taplar now not sure it make sense but i am hoping it will b e
[16:28:03] <hellyeah> fancyfetus:  try jsfiddle
[16:28:16] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you're trying to collect data off of pages - i get it, but you're automating the wrong bits ;)
[16:28:22] <hellyeah> fancyfetus:  you can do "ajax thing" in jsfiddle
[16:28:34] <robertmaxrees> fancyfetus you're basically doing it correctly.
[16:28:48] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  how can i do it correctly?
[16:28:59] <hellyeah> wrong bits you mean "top and left"
[16:29:02] <fancyfetus> robertmaxrees: the issue is that the resulting URL has the [] encoded in the param names.
[16:29:06] <fancyfetus> and that messes up the result
[16:29:25] <robertmaxrees> fancyfetus ah so you want to encode the key/value pairs differently?
[16:29:29] <robertmaxrees> what's the data look like?
[16:29:29] <fancyfetus> So the resulting url, looks like this: myURL?keywords%5B%5D=data1
[16:29:40] <fancyfetus> instead of myURL?keywords[]=data1
[16:31:06] <al_nz1> On the narrative tab why am I not getting the wysiwyg text area? https://jsfiddle.net/km9n2f3j/
[16:31:13] <robertmaxrees> oh, you can't technically include square brackets in URLs fancyfetus
[16:31:25] <robertmaxrees> you'll see it sometimes but it's not technically valid.
[16:31:32] <fancyfetus> Oh wait a second, I think this is an issue with the server receiving the request...
[16:31:42] <fancyfetus> My server doesn't recognize keyword[]=data1
[16:31:51] <fancyfetus> It wants keyword=data1,data2
[16:31:55] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 open your consolke.
[16:32:36] <robertmaxrees> fwiw al_nz1 that's the wrong way to use jsfiddle.
[16:32:45] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: ReferenceError: define is not defined
[16:32:46] <al_nz1> ?
[16:32:57] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 and something about wysihtml5
[16:33:05] <robertmaxrees> but if your page has js errors, you need to fix them.
[16:33:08] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: re jsfiddle - in what way is it wrong?
[16:33:38] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 jsfiddle is meant for reduced test cases.  including html/body tags, script and style tags, etc in the html page is no bueno.
[16:33:46] <robertmaxrees> basically, it's not for the whole page.  just the bare minimum.
[16:34:35] <taplar> like a bikini
[16:34:36] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: oh I see, so you need to trim it down
[16:34:51] <al_nz1> like a g string
[16:35:17] <taplar> minimum, not non-existant
[16:35:33] <taplar> ;)
[16:35:36] <hellyeah> like tast case
[16:35:42] <al_nz1> Im not thinking about code more
[16:35:57] <al_nz1> ok, back to code. I think I need require.js
[16:35:59] <taplar> my jobe is done!
[16:41:01] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  why i am automating wrong beats?
[16:42:10] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah i'd manually configure the scraper for each page.
[16:42:15] <robertmaxrees> and/or site
[16:43:16] <Ice_Strike> You see anything wrong with this?
[16:43:17] <Ice_Strike> jQuery.data('.button-delete', "id", entryId);
[16:43:53] <robertmaxrees> why are you using data that way?
[16:44:21] <Ice_Strike> Why not?
[16:45:36] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  i am at the beginning i will learn that things :D
[16:46:09] <robertmaxrees> Ice_Strike because $.fn.data is the easier one to understand
[16:46:31] <robertmaxrees> even the docs will tell you "Note: This is a low-level method; a more convenient .data() is also available."
[16:46:48] <robertmaxrees> $('.button-delete').data('id', entryId)
[16:47:32] <Ice_Strike> Ah I see
[16:47:34] <Ice_Strike> stupid doc.
[16:47:38] <Ice_Strike> Thanks.
[16:47:43] <hellyeah> :D
[16:47:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:47:48] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[16:47:58] <hellyeah> stupid doc
[16:48:00] <hellyeah> i like it
[16:48:04] <hellyeah> hahaha
[16:48:31] <Ice_Strike> :)
[16:48:46] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees I was talking about documentation
[16:48:53] <Ice_Strike> https://api.jquery.com/jquery.data/
[16:49:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it tells you what i just told you.
[16:50:27] <robertmaxrees> first thing after telling you the args - "Note: This is a low-level method; a more convenient .data() is also available."
[16:51:29] <Ice_Strike> Ahhh I see.
[16:51:30] <Ice_Strike> :)
[16:51:35] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[16:55:46] <Ice_Strike> https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/25325/
[16:56:07] <Ice_Strike> How can I pass thisButton to .btn-save click event block?
[16:56:14] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:56:19] <robertmaxrees> you... don't?
[16:56:44] <robertmaxrees> what are you looking for?
[16:57:29] <Ice_Strike> robertmaxrees Try it out. You can click on any button and then model popup. Click on Save Changes and then it will alert ID
[16:57:32] <Ice_Strike> Seem to work
[16:57:43] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[16:57:48] <robertmaxrees> global variables are bad.
[16:57:48] <Ice_Strike> Bad?
[16:57:55] <robertmaxrees> confusing.
[16:57:59] <robertmaxrees> difficult to troubleshoot.
[16:58:01] <robertmaxrees> leaky.
[16:58:06] <robertmaxrees> hold state in a bad way.
[16:58:13] <Ice_Strike> It pass data-entry-id to a button (save changes) in a model
[16:58:30] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to use global vars for this.
[16:58:35] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to figure out which button was clicked?
[16:59:15] <Ice_Strike> I don't think you understood.
[16:59:19] <Ice_Strike> You can see 3 buttons
[16:59:23] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[16:59:29] <robertmaxrees> you want to know which one was clicked to open the modal.
[16:59:29] <Ice_Strike> Each button contain   data-entry-id
[16:59:59] <Ice_Strike> When a model open, it also has a button "save changes" I would need to know which button was clicked like entry id of that button.
[17:00:16] <robertmaxrees> i'm telling you that a global var to hold that information is a bad idea.
[17:00:32] <Ice_Strike> So, what is alternative approch?
[17:00:39] <robertmaxrees> this fiddle already has that baked in.
[17:00:44] <robertmaxrees> $('.btn-save', thisModal).data('id', entryId);
[17:01:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/r649Lq96/2/
[17:01:13] <Ice_Strike> Yes, .btn-save in a model.
[17:01:18] <Ice_Strike> Looking
[17:02:03] <Ice_Strike> Did you break something? It no longer popup :)
[17:02:35] <robertmaxrees> are you actually looking at the code ooor...?
[17:02:42] <robertmaxrees> ;)

[17:03:15] <robertmaxrees> there's no reason for thisButton to be global.
[17:03:26] <robertmaxrees> var id = $(this).data('id'); already has the id you care about.
[17:04:02] <Ice_Strike> Seen it
[17:04:13] <robertmaxrees> so that's all you need.
[17:04:15] <Ice_Strike>          var thisModal = $(this);
[17:04:15] <Ice_Strike>          var entryId = thisButton.data('entry-id');
[17:04:18] <robertmaxrees> woah.
[17:04:19] <Ice_Strike> That actually wrong
[17:04:24] <robertmaxrees> how is that "Wrong"?
[17:04:43] <Ice_Strike> Because thisButton is not reffering to button in a model
[17:04:52] <Ice_Strike> That is why I used thisButton = $(event.relatedTarget);
[17:05:02] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:05:27] <Ice_Strike> which refer buttons Button 1, Button 2, Button 3 as example.
[17:06:05] <robertmaxrees> you're getting the data-entry-id from those buttons in the modal already.  is this not what you want?
[17:06:21] <Ice_Strike> data-entry-id is not in the model :)
[17:06:34] <robertmaxrees> it is currently being set into the modal.
[17:06:37] <robertmaxrees> as text.
[17:09:36] <imacinto> what is the correct way to do what I'm trying to do here: https://jsfiddle.net/m5xwg03m/ -- click anywhere in the paragraph and have it trigger a click to the link inside it?
[17:10:24] <robertmaxrees> imacinto depends.
[17:10:38] <robertmaxrees> do you just want to go to the link, or do you legit want to trigger a handler on the link?
[17:10:52] <imacinto> robertmaxrees: I want to trigger a handler on the link
[17:11:01] <imacinto> and go to its destination
[17:11:09] <robertmaxrees> so both?
[17:11:12] <robertmaxrees> that'll be a pain.
[17:11:13] <robertmaxrees> hrmmmm.
[17:12:34] <robertmaxrees> i can't think of any way to conveniently do that.
[17:14:02] <imacinto> robertmaxrees: I was thinking of doing something with setting a data attribute on the anchor, like $anchor.data("parsing", true) and check that but it was preventing the link from being followed
[17:14:21] <robertmaxrees> right, you're going to be battling some weird state in this case.
[17:14:31] <robertmaxrees> why not wrap the whole thing in an anchor?
[17:15:31] <imacinto> not an option in my use case. I don't have total control over the markup like that, and even if I did it'd open me up to doing way more work
[17:19:35] <robertmaxrees> it'd be way less in this case, but fair enough.
[17:20:48] <robertmaxrees> i might check the target vs. the currentTarget or something like that.
[17:20:55] <robertmaxrees> and conditionally preventDefault() or something.
[17:21:01] <imacinto> that's a good suggestion, I like that
[17:25:07] <imacinto> how do I determine if the target is a paragraph element or an anchor element? I'm looking at the MDN docs for HTMLElement Web API and nothing's jumping out
[17:25:23] <robertmaxrees> check out the jquery docs for the event object.
[17:26:03] <pokerpoker> i'm doing mySel.parent().append('<div class="alert alert-success">test</div>').show().fadeOut(10000);   The problem is, fadeOut hits parent.  How do i limit it to the append?
[17:26:25] <taplar> find the appended element
[17:26:29] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:26:38] <robertmaxrees> or create it manually and stop chaining everything.
[17:26:48] <taplar> the majority of jQuery.fn methods return the element they operateupon
[17:30:32] <pokerpoker> is there a way to append if id doesn't exist in child?
[17:30:43] <imacinto> robertmaxrees: I'm so close, but it looks like the click event on the link is getting eaten -- https://jsfiddle.net/bangarang/z1kc67Lk/
[17:30:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:31:14] <robertmaxrees> imacinto hrm.
[17:32:57] <taplar> pokerpoker: what do you mean?  like in your example above?
[17:33:34] <al_nz1> why does my "narrative" tab not have a text area that will take input?
[17:33:35] <al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/km9n2f3j/
[17:34:09] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 ferreal that's not a very good fiddle.
[17:34:18] <robertmaxrees> and again.
[17:34:20] <robertmaxrees> open your console
[17:34:26] <robertmaxrees> yiou have two errors you need to fix.
[17:34:29] <pokerpoker> taplar, see how i was appending the <div class=...   is there a way to say if the div does not exist, then append?
[17:34:44] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 wysihtml5 looks like it's not loading correctly.
[17:34:45] <robertmaxrees> so fix that.
[17:37:15] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: and you say that based on the console message : https://jsfiddle.net/km9n2f3j/
[17:37:18] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:37:22] <robertmaxrees> same thing as before.
[17:37:28] <al_nz1> grrr
[17:37:28] <al_nz1> not that
[17:37:33] <robertmaxrees> if you have js errors and things aren't working, fix the errors.
[17:37:40] <robertmaxrees> you'd be surprised what happens.
[17:38:28] <taplar> pokerpoker: you could try to find it first
[17:38:58] <taplar> if (mySel.parent().find('.alert-success').length < 1) { ... }
[17:39:20] <robertmaxrees> or just if (!mySel.parent().find('.something').length) {}
[17:39:25] <taplar> true
[17:40:02] <pokerpoker> after a fadeOut(1000), what's the clean method to make the box able to show() again  - it leaves opacity:0
[17:41:03] <taplar> so your doing fadeOut and show?
[17:41:21] <robertmaxrees> why not use css transitions and add/remove a class instead?
[17:41:29] <taplar> ^ or fadeIn to be consistent
[17:41:38] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[17:45:35] <pokerpoker> i do a fadeIn(250).fadeOut(1000);   and next time it hits, it won't do it
[17:46:47] <taplar> hmm, i wonder if it's stepping on itself
[17:47:00] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[17:47:07] <taplar> try fadeIn(250).wait(250).fadeOut...
[17:47:32] <taplar> wait or waitFor, i forget
[17:49:25] <taplar> delay!
[17:49:27] <taplar> bah
[17:49:45] <robertmaxrees> or just use callbacks.
[17:50:14] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: ok, a bit of googling and it looks like require.js is needed
[17:50:24] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 that's one of your errors, yes.
[17:50:39] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/otccq10v/
[17:51:08] <taplar> pokerpoker: ^ so they do clean up so i can only assume your stepping on yourself some where
[17:52:09] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: but I have included require.js but still getting the undefined error
[17:52:26] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 lol
[17:52:27] <al_nz1> does the order I load them in matter
[17:52:30] <al_nz1> I guess it does
[17:52:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah it will.
[17:53:27] <al_nz1> oh shoot -fixing that error made it worse
[17:53:33] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:53:37] <robertmaxrees> it just revealed more issues.
[17:55:24] <al_nz1> ha, i like the more simplistic view :-)
[18:00:44] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: looks like its all to do with the way requires.js and other script tags are loaded....am I heading in the right direction?
[18:01:00] <robertmaxrees> let's back waaaaaay up
[18:01:10] <pokerpoker> this is weird.  I'm doing   mySel.show(250).delay(250).hide(2000);   it ends up removing the item out.  There is no parent().
[18:01:37] <robertmaxrees> what's the impetus here al_nz1?  how has your site been functionin without require this long if you've been trying to use it?
[18:02:35] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: well the site hasnt been deployed if thats what you mean. Up till now its been ok, and I have most recently added some tabs and now want to add a wysiwyg editor on one of the tabs
[18:02:40] <al_nz1> and to be explicit
[18:02:46] <al_nz1> yes, I am a clueless newbie
[18:02:52] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 erm
[18:03:12] <robertmaxrees> did you like add require modules that just never worked or...?
[18:03:28] <robertmaxrees> really confused about how you got this far
[18:03:58] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: Up till I added the wysiwyg editor , I dont think i needed require.js?
[18:04:26] <robertmaxrees> so if you go back and remove the editor coide, do you still get the rjs errors?
[18:04:33] <al_nz1> no
[18:04:40] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:04:44] <robertmaxrees> there's your answer.
[18:04:47] <robertmaxrees> what's the name of the editor?
[18:06:35] <al_nz1> ok, hold on
[18:15:38] <pokerpoker> without a remove(), what else would cause the element being removed?
[18:15:59] <robertmaxrees> something's replacing the contents of a parent element.
[18:16:11] <robertmaxrees> using .replace() or .html() or something.
[18:16:31] <pokerpoker> is there a way to trace it via firebug?  or do i just have to trial+error
[18:18:23] <FancyCamel> Hey there, I've got an ajax form. When you click the submit button I need to do a little svg animation prior to the $.ajax function running. I know how long the animation is going to take and my Q is how to delay the ajax function from running prior to the animation completing? Do I just wrap the $.ajax in a setTimeout(,myTime) ? That seems like a poor approach to it so I thought I'd ask.
[18:19:12] <robertmaxrees> pokerpoker there's a breakpoint on dom change thing in the native dev tools iirc.
[18:19:26] <taplar> FancyCamel: does the svg animation have any sort of callback?
[18:20:16] <robertmaxrees> wait why are you delaying the ajax call?
[18:21:24] <FancyCamel> Because the ajax call further animates the svg.
[18:21:28] <FancyCamel> Through xhr%
[18:21:32] <FancyCamel> https://material.uplabs.com/posts/download-animation
[18:21:43] <FancyCamel> That's an example of what is being replicated
[18:21:57] <robertmaxrees> ah.  if there's no callback then, there's really nothing you can do.
[18:22:34] <FancyCamel> wrapping a setTimeout thing like that won't work then ? :/
[18:22:42] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[18:22:48] <robertmaxrees> i mean the timeout works
[18:22:49] <robertmaxrees> sorry.
[18:23:31] <FancyCamel> Just seems kinda haphazard I guess. But, hey, when I'm being told to add in some totally new svg functionality the night before a deadline, hacky works.
[18:23:36] <FancyCamel> I've never even done this stuff.
[18:23:37] <FancyCamel> :v
[18:23:40] <FancyCamel> But thanks :)
[18:23:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:24:03] <robertmaxrees> technically the right way to do this is to just fire the ajax request anyway
[18:24:10] <robertmaxrees> and then start calculating after the initial animation.
[18:24:32] <FancyCamel> What do you mean? Currently I'm updating the circle based on % in xhr of .Ajax
[18:25:05] <robertmaxrees> right.  why hold up the ajax call?
[18:25:48] <FancyCamel> Referring to that animation again, the circle starts filling up at the point from where the dot lands. If the call isn't held up then the line will have already "drawn" before the dot has reached the outline ring
[18:26:13] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: ok I am using this editor: v
[18:26:14] <al_nz1> https://github.com/Waxolunist/bootstrap3-wysihtml5-bower
[18:26:15] <robertmaxrees> you could use a timeout to set a state var that you keep checking.
[18:27:35] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 that link says it's deprecated
[18:28:33] <robertmaxrees> either way, looks pretty straightforward.  just make sure you're including the right js file before using it and boom.
[18:28:41] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: yeah true, but I am getting via cdn
[18:29:22] <robertmaxrees> al_nz1 ... that doesn't change anything i just suggested ;)
[18:29:39] <al_nz1> http://pastebin.com/NDtrUyQJ
[18:30:24] <robertmaxrees> fffff
[18:30:26] <robertmaxrees> pastebiiiin
[18:30:27] <al_nz1> but as I said, once i added require.js the console fils with errors- I have read about require.js and I see it looks like it should be used to load all the js files?
[18:30:47] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[18:30:57] <robertmaxrees> so it sounds like maybe you're including the wrong version of the file.
[18:31:14] <robertmaxrees> pj. ypui
[18:31:21] <al_nz1> version of the bootstrap3-wysyightml file?
[18:31:22] <robertmaxrees> *oh, you're including it multiple times.
[18:31:34] <robertmaxrees> try to include it just once.
[18:32:42] <al_nz1> whats included multiple times?
[18:32:58] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap3-wysihtml5.all.js
[18:33:06] <robertmaxrees> you're including it and the min version.
[18:33:08] <robertmaxrees> you only need one.
[18:33:58] <al_nz1> oh i see yes
[18:36:22] <al_nz1> but still - the editor is not displaying properly - http://i.imgur.com/lGkUuya.png
[18:36:32] <al_nz1> and still that error from require.js
[18:37:25] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) the sample page just includes the script.
[18:37:27] <robertmaxrees> no need for require.
[18:39:46] <al_nz1> yeah the reason I included require.js was because a google of that error (ReferenceError: define is not defined) pointed to it being needed
[18:39:58] <al_nz1> but its not listed as required on the github page for that editor
[18:40:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah but you probably odn't actually need it.
[18:41:31] <al_nz1> I suppose to make any sense of this i need the non minified version : http://i.imgur.com/yvFP6Cy.png
[18:41:45] <robertmaxrees> screenshots of code are the worst :(
[18:41:48] <robertmaxrees> and nah.
[18:41:55] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to try an updated version.
[18:42:34] <al_nz1> updated version of the editor?
[18:42:46] <robertmaxrees> yes
[18:42:53] <robertmaxrees> the githob link you sent said it was out of date.
[18:43:34] <al_nz1> 0.3.3 was the last release but its a few years old(2014) and thats the same cdn I am using
[18:43:46] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) just pointing out things i'd try.
[18:44:13] <al_nz1> yeah - no sweat I appreicate it
[18:47:07] <al_nz1> this one has been maintained more recently
[18:47:09] <al_nz1> https://github.com/steveathon/bootstrap-wysiwyg
[18:47:58] <robertmaxrees> then use that one :)
[19:02:10] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: is there a way to force these libraries not to load until the deps have loaded?
[19:02:20] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:02:25] <al_nz1> I think my flaky internt here is not helping
[19:02:39] <robertmaxrees> just gotta put them in order.
[19:02:57] <al_nz1> so they load in a serial fashion?
[19:03:09] <al_nz1> one lib wont load until the first one is done?
[19:03:13] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[19:03:20] <robertmaxrees> more like they parse in order.
[19:04:27] <al_nz1> This is getting annoying
[19:04:49] <al_nz1> that new lib is putting the text on screen but its not in anything that looks like a text area input
[19:04:58] <al_nz1> its just on a line on its own
[19:05:04] <robertmaxrees> and you've included the necessary css?
[19:05:09] <robertmaxrees> no other js errors, no 404s, etc?
[19:05:44] <al_nz1> datetime picker is complaining that moment.js needs to be loaded first, but it is the first js file i load
[19:05:56] <robertmaxrees> okay so forreal you need to fix all js errors.
[19:06:04] <robertmaxrees> like, even if they don't seem related.
[19:06:26] <al_nz1> ok, but how do I fix it? momnet.js is loaded first
[19:06:40] <robertmaxrees> open your network tab
[19:07:10] <al_nz1> yes
[19:07:15] <robertmaxrees> any 404s?
[19:08:26] <al_nz1> oh yeah I see datepicker-min
[19:08:32] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:15:46] <al_nz1> sigh
[19:15:57] <al_nz1> the 404s have gone
[19:16:02] <robertmaxrees> fixed?
[19:16:07] <al_nz1> but it still complain that moment.js needs to be loaded first
[19:16:25] <robertmaxrees> are4 you using like async or w/e
[19:16:43] <al_nz1> i dont know what they are
[19:17:05] <robertmaxrees> do the script tags have like async or deferred in them?
[19:17:20] <al_nz1> no
[19:17:38] <robertmaxrees> can you share out the working page code then?
[19:17:44] <al_nz1> I can share my screen
[19:17:53] <robertmaxrees> heh, not really helpful.
[19:18:12] <al_nz1> (which has the code on it!)
[19:18:29] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:18:31] <robertmaxrees> no thanks.
[19:18:37] <robertmaxrees> really prefer to poke at it m'self
[19:18:41] <robertmaxrees> but triple check everything.
[19:18:46] <robertmaxrees> make sure you're using the proper doc readies.
[19:18:47] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[19:18:54] <al_nz1> ok - so how do I share the code
[19:19:00] <al_nz1> fiddle?
[19:19:07] <robertmaxrees> like you did earlier with that pastebin.
[19:19:13] <robertmaxrees> only try something like bpaste instead.
[19:19:19] <al_nz1> ok
[19:19:20] <robertmaxrees> pastebin flags for spam way too quickly.
[19:21:05] <al_nz1> ok - https://bpaste.net/show/af98b513eee6
[19:21:41] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:21:43] <robertmaxrees> invalid markup
[19:21:43] <robertmaxrees> 	<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.hotkeys/0.8b/jquery.hotkeys.min.js"</script>
[19:21:52] <robertmaxrees> need to fix that.
[19:23:43] <al_nz1> why is that invalid?
[19:23:55] <robertmaxrees> you're missing the > for the start tag.
[19:24:16] <robertmaxrees> should be <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/jquery.hotkeys/0.8b/jquery.hotkeys.min.js"></script>
[19:24:21] <al_nz1> oh im a dick
[19:24:33] <al_nz1> sublime normally helps me with that
[19:24:36] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:24:39] <al_nz1> dick
[19:24:47] <robertmaxrees> nah you're fine.
[19:24:55] <robertmaxrees> we've all made a mistake like that before.
[19:25:23] <al_nz1> ok, so it loads now without errors
[19:25:45] <al_nz1> but I want to get the wyswiyg editor into a nice input area
[19:26:09] <al_nz1> looking more like: https://jhollingworth.github.io/bootstrap-wysihtml5/
[19:26:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:26:17] <al_nz1> i appreciate the tool bar is extra
[19:26:18] <robertmaxrees> now you just need to init it.
[19:26:23] <robertmaxrees> $('.textarea').wysihtml5();
[19:27:30] <al_nz1> no i think the new plugin is $('.textarea').wysiwyg.html();
[19:27:38] <al_nz1> https://github.com/steveathon/bootstrap-wysiwyg
[19:27:38] <robertmaxrees> ....
[19:27:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:27:45] <robertmaxrees> duder
[19:27:48] <robertmaxrees> which one are you using?
[19:27:49] <al_nz1> and thats towards the bottom of the paste
[19:27:55] <al_nz1> but it doesnt do it?
[19:28:18] <al_nz1> I guess I need to include some inline css : #editor {overflow:scroll; max-height:300px}
[19:28:32] <robertmaxrees> $('#editor').wysiwyg();
[19:28:40] <robertmaxrees> that last link uses this.
[19:29:56] <al_nz1> yeah I have that in my js file $('.textarea').wysiwyg();
[19:30:07] <al_nz1> which links to
[19:30:11] <robertmaxrees> i can't see the contents of your js file.
[19:30:15] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[19:30:20] <al_nz1> <div class="textarea" placeholder="Enter text ..." contenteditable="true">Make my day....</div>
[19:30:26] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you do that in the console?
[19:30:56] <al_nz1> https://bpaste.net/show/9a4f52ef19a6
[19:33:02] <al_nz1> to be clear I do have a text area rendering .... it just doesnt have that nice border
[19:33:09] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:33:14] <robertmaxrees> so the plugin is initializing?
[19:34:00] <al_nz1> i think so : https://snag.gy/LRMOVm.jpg
[19:34:12] <al_nz1> I can type in that area and it expands
[19:34:26] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're missing stlyes or styles are getting overridden
[19:34:53] <al_nz1> I have added inline #editor {overflow:scroll; max-height:300px}
[19:35:02] <al_nz1> ohh
[19:35:09] <al_nz1> maybe it should be #textarea
[19:35:22] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[19:35:34] <robertmaxrees> except you're using a class and not an id in your html.
[19:35:37] <al_nz1> or .textarea {.... for the css
[19:36:38] <al_nz1> getting closer....
[23:52:04] <fs_noob> I'm having trouble understanding something basic about Jquery. I thought selectors were for selecting elements.
[23:52:28] <fs_noob> If I use the selector: var accessories = $("img[data-linkeddoll]"); I expect to receive an object containing all the images with that attribute
[23:52:51] <fs_noob> instead I get a long list of sets of all of those images
[23:55:58] <fs_noob> ah god never mind I had a loop going that I didnt notice
