[01:55:13] <Unopoo> I have an old app using synchronous XHR request, and it worked all fine
[01:55:13] <Unopoo> but recentely, boom, the conosle log in chrome show me this:
[01:55:13] <Unopoo> Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. For more help, check http://xhr.spec.whatwg.org/.
[01:55:32] <BigDX> Hi
[01:56:10] <Uhkis> Unopoo: now fix your code
[01:56:17] <Unopoo> why it suddentely has this warning?
[01:56:40] <Uhkis> Unopoo: it really can't get any more clearer than that...
[01:56:47] <Unopoo> Uhkis: I know you will say this, change sync to async? but there is a reason at first to use async request
[01:57:07] <Unopoo> Uhkis:focus on 'suddenly'
[01:57:19] <BigDX> maybe i just dont see the obvious, but how can i detect events (transitionend) from "general siblings" (~ selector)???
[01:57:33] <Uhkis> Unopoo: it's not suddenly, it was a warning for a while
[01:57:58] <Unopoo> from when? my app is running okay like last month?
[01:58:01] <hellyeah> damn
[01:58:15] <hellyeah> my close function is the reason of the error
[01:58:18] <hellyeah> damn damn damn
[01:59:30] <BigDX> would $(x ~ y).on(transitionend, fct() {}); work?
[01:59:32] <Unopoo> Uhkis: is there other way around instead change all the sync request to async? that would require huge change, and I'm tired refractoring my code O_O
[02:00:42] <Uhkis> Unopoo: not really
[02:02:52] <Unopoo> Uhkis: oh shit, why sync request exists at the begining? if it never exists I would never use it and then I don't need to scratch my head now. plus, if it exists at the begining, why then disable it!!
[02:09:05] <hellyeah> found the line
[02:09:19] <hellyeah> found the shitty error
[03:00:04] <BigDX> could "appendTo()" trigger a transition?
[03:00:37] <BigDX> a delayed transition fires to early when a sibling gets moved with appendto
[03:01:03] <BigDX> but i dont get why/how
[03:03:24] <norc> BigDX: You could override the function to additionally fire an event
[03:07:39] <norc> BigDX: Straight up stolen from stackoverflow: http://jsfiddle.net/zwmn3qy6/
[03:08:13] <norc> Figure out the rest. :-P
[03:14:56] <BigDX> norc: thx, but you got me wrong ... the transistion-animation fired unexpectedly
[03:15:30] <BigDX> but found the problem ... a class was activated by the new order
[03:15:37] <BigDX> of elements
[03:15:51] <BigDX> and overwrote the transistion-rule
[03:16:19] <norc> BigDX: Indeed I misunderstood. :)
[03:16:56] <BigDX> weird ... jsfiddle is "broken" in my firefox?!
[03:17:21] <BigDX> that aks for good ol restart ^^
[03:17:24] <norc> Can you define "broken" ?
[03:18:01] <BigDX> unordered elements, everthing at the top of windows etc
[03:18:16] <BigDX> jsfiddle itself, not the fidle
[03:18:47] <BigDX> anyway, nevermind, firefox is running for days now
[03:20:08] <`ULT> hI I have a litle question. I have made some togglingstuff. It is working smooth on jsfiddle and on the webserver.
[03:20:13] <BigDX> but something more html/css-relaited ... how can i add different classes with transitions each to one element WITHOUT that this transition conflict?
[03:21:08] <`ULT> but on my localsurver it is not smooth/ halting
[03:24:29] <norc> `ULT: share the jsfiddle with us
[03:25:02] <`ULT> oke: its not a big problem norc, but i am just wondering why
[03:25:04] <`ULT> https://jsfiddle.net/q49g9fof/16/
[03:30:27] <BigDX> ... without using js of course
[03:33:46] <norc> Is using _ for local variables a safe thing, or does jquery use this?
[03:35:45] <norc> In particular I want to use a common Ruby pattern: $('.foo').each(function(_, element) {} )
[03:45:10] <xvure> Wow, looks like JockRitch had fun this morning...
[03:54:40] <`ULTafk> haha indeed ;)
[03:55:50] <rikkipitt> hey guys, i'm having trouble thinking of a good way to achieve the following... I have a div that when i scroll down past it i want to be able to slide back in when i click an icon
[03:56:06] <rikkipitt> should I clone it and expand a div or try and slide it down?
[04:13:52] <Duikb00t> Someone an idea what might be wrong with my mobile menu?  (When you scale the site down to less then 900px )
[04:13:54] <Duikb00t> http://alturl.com/s22eg
[04:22:45] <kaizur> Duikb00t: remove !important from display property in nav ul selector
[04:27:14] <yousaf> hi all
[04:27:37] <yousaf> is it possible to create a experience similar to http://codyhouse.co/demo/image-comparison-slider/ but without images?
[04:28:09] <yousaf> I am thinking about creating similar effect for comparing two divs which contain several image, text etc?
[04:29:19] <taplar> seems like something dealing with a slider based on dragging, in that case
[04:29:42] <taplar> don't see why you couldn't
[04:32:14] <Duikb00t> kaizuri indeed that sovles it thanks a lot
[04:32:19] <Duikb00t> Do you also have to click twice?
[04:32:22] <Duikb00t> When you want to open it?
[04:33:05] <taplar> i think you have your open variable initialized to true, yes?
[04:33:17] <taplar> i'd have to check again
[04:33:42] <Duikb00t> * kaizur
[04:34:25] <taplar> nvm, your using it for what you want to happen, not it's current state
[04:36:55] <taplar> it's already open for me though.  i have to double click to close it
[04:41:15] <Duikb00t> Yes indeedI taplar
[04:41:22] <Duikb00t> And when it's closed and you resize full screen
[04:41:24] <Duikb00t> the menu is gone
[04:41:32] <Duikb00t> so I have probably done something wrong
[04:41:59] <taplar> do you want it auto open?  cause if not that would just be a display:none on it by default
[04:43:07] <Duikb00t> 1. I don't want to have a double click.
[04:43:54] <Duikb00t> 2. It's allowed to be open by default.
[04:44:21] <taplar> then change your open to start off as false, so the first action it takes is to try to close instead of open
[04:45:04] <Duikb00t> Sweet thanks!
[04:45:26] <Duikb00t> that solves the double click  issue as well.
[04:45:48] <Duikb00t> but when I close it and my browser is scaled back to desktop the menu is gone. :P
[04:45:52] <taplar> or if you wanted you could do without the variable all together, and just check if the menu is(':visible') to know what to do
[04:47:02] <taplar> that's just flavor though really
[04:47:14] <Duikb00t> Ok
[04:47:23] <Duikb00t> Ill keep it like this but just the scaling issue should be fixed.
[04:47:32] <Duikb00t> Thanks for helping me to change that var name to false :)
[04:47:43] <taplar> no problemo
[04:48:04] <Duikb00t> I'll upload the new version.
[04:48:50] <Duikb00t> * taplar  new version is available
[04:49:12] <taplar> :)
[04:49:14] <Duikb00t> Do you have the issue as well when you scale to the mobile version. And you close the menu. When you scale again to desktop the menu is gone?
[04:49:30] <taplar> i don't seem to
[04:49:39] <taplar> it both stays open or stays closed
[04:49:43] <taplar> i am in firefox though
[04:49:48] <taplar> if that makes a difference
[04:50:04] <taplar> oh!
[04:50:07] <taplar> yes
[04:50:12] <taplar> you mean it goes away all together
[04:50:17] <Duikb00t> Indeed.
[04:50:33] <taplar> yeah, should it not?  my assumption was that was a mobile only menu
[04:50:48] <Duikb00t> It's the same menu
[04:50:55] <Duikb00t> I just restyle it on other media queries
[04:51:11] <taplar> gotcha!
[04:51:14] <taplar> sorry
[04:51:22] <Duikb00t> No sorry, thanks for willing to help me :D
[04:52:12] <taplar> on the resize to desktop you'd need to show() it again
[04:52:34] <Duikb00t> With JS
[04:52:43] <taplar> yeah
[04:58:20] <Duikb00t> taplar http://paste.ee/p/ocKbu
[04:58:20] <Duikb00t> fixed it
[04:58:54] <taplar> :)
[04:59:09] <Duikb00t> have you maybe an idea
[04:59:15] <Duikb00t> how i could show the miage the best on desktops?
[04:59:19] <Duikb00t> ( front page )
[04:59:27] <Duikb00t> i want to show the user as much as possible from the picture )
[04:59:46] <Duikb00t> here on my 4k screen its really cool but yesterday I saw it on a 15 inch oldschool screen and it was a horror.   :D
[05:00:43] <taplar> it looks like your already scaling it
[05:00:52] <Duikb00t> Im doing that yes
[05:00:56] <Duikb00t> But i don't like it you do?
[05:01:00] <Duikb00t> Are you able seeing the grass all the time?
[05:01:24] <taplar> not that, no
[05:02:02] <Duikb00t> :( damn
[05:02:46] <taplar> something like that if i understand you, would be more like a fixed background
[05:02:58] <Renkineko> hi everybody
[05:04:06] <Renkineko> I would like to know if there is a way to put a jQuery ui tabs in float right, but with the order of the tabs preserved (when I just do a float right on the tabs, the first become the visually the last) ?
[05:04:59] <Renkineko> I searched on google but everyone seems happy to have this order reversed, and I don't see a trick in css or else to avoid this behaviour
[05:06:25] <Duikb00t> taplar You mean position: fixed?d
[05:06:39] <Duikb00t> On the image?
[05:06:52] <taplar> Duikb00t: ooooh, probably not the end product, but try this.  on .bgImage change the background to this and see what you think
[05:06:52] <taplar> background: transparent url("../images/bg_haan.jpg") no-repeat fixed 0% 70%
[05:08:15] <Duikb00t> Not bad at all!
[05:08:18] <Duikb00t> GReat
[05:08:20] <Duikb00t> fix
[05:08:51] <taplar> 75% gives me more grass.  if you like it, just some tweaking to get you what you want, :)
[05:09:41] <Duikb00t> already pretty cool
[05:09:51] <Duikb00t> I only have on my huge screen white borders left and right
[05:14:52] <Duikb00t> But that's a hard one to solve because then dimensions on the image are needed to be changed
[05:15:46] <taplar> yeah, scaling is fubared now
[05:15:58] <Duikb00t> dammit :D
[05:22:31] <taplar> ok, now the background is doing a little stretch thing, but...
[05:23:02] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/nmet5rx9/
[05:23:41] <taplar> it's does scale though
[05:26:14] <Duikb00t> taplar PERFECT man!
[05:28:22] <hellyeah> hey
[05:28:45] <Duikb00t> taplar oeps,
[05:28:50] <hellyeah> can you click button then click square button on the table and refresh it modal window goes down how can i avoid that http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/6/embedded/result/
[05:28:56] <Duikb00t> indeed it's stretching
[05:31:14] <hellyeah> any ideas?
[05:31:26] <Duikb00t> wish I coul dhelp you hellyeah
[05:31:37] <taplar> which square button?
[05:31:46] <taplar> i'm trying to click the hand and it's not doing anything anymore
[05:32:13] <hellyeah> no no
[05:32:15] <hellyeah> not hand
[05:32:21] <hellyeah> first column of table
[05:32:30] <taplar> magnifying glass
[05:32:35] <hellyeah> sorry it is image button
[05:32:39] <taplar> k
[05:32:47] <hellyeah> i typed wrong
[05:32:54] <taplar> hmm
[05:33:10] <hellyeah> i can guess the reason
[05:33:16] <hellyeah> but i need to solve it
[05:33:27] <hellyeah> i mean big modal window takes the position
[05:33:27] <taplar> what is your guess?
[05:33:49] <hellyeah> and it puts small modal window to the place that nothing there
[05:34:09] <hellyeah> sorry for my english
[05:34:25] <hellyeah> but in the first time it puts everything how it is designed
[05:36:09] <hellyeah> i have position:absolute for popup and popup2
[05:38:17] <taplar> um, one thing, not your problem, but may be a contributing factor
[05:38:33] <taplar> in your restoration logic, your clicking .buttonClass
[05:39:04] <hellyeah> yes?
[05:39:16] <taplar> every single one of your magnifying row links has that class
[05:39:21] <taplar> your clicking them all with that
[05:39:53] <hellyeah> well i try to give them an id
[05:40:18] <hellyeah> check buttonId function
[05:40:21] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/8/
[05:40:27] <taplar> i see they have a number id
[05:41:02] <taplar> uh, they all have id 12
[05:41:58] <taplar> ln 5, your seting every buttons id every iteration
[05:44:21] <Renkineko> Hi, came back. I'll reask my question just in case (didn't see highlight so I could have miss an answer ^^) : I would like to know if there is a way to put a jQuery ui tabs in float right, but with the order of the tabs preserved (when I just do a float right on the tabs, the first become visually the last) ?
[05:44:54] <hellyeah> taplar:
[05:45:03] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:45:12] <hellyeah> i give every button to i
[05:45:21] <hellyeah> i suppose it will be 0 1 2 3 4 ... 12
[05:45:28] <hellyeah> but all id are 12
[05:46:35] <taplar> yep
[05:46:41] <taplar> your setting them all
[05:46:43] <taplar> every time
[05:46:46] <taplar> not one at a time
[05:46:56] <hellyeah> humm
[05:47:06] <hellyeah> so for looping 12 time
[05:47:15] <hellyeah> anit is overwritten each time
[05:47:16] <hellyeah> ?
[05:47:45] <hellyeah> how can i avoid that?
[05:48:42] <hellyeah> also there is one problem
[05:48:58] <hellyeah> when yo click locking glassfor example kvirc.net
[05:49:09] <hellyeah> and refresh the page it shows the first tow of table
[05:49:16] <taplar> just set them one at a time
[05:49:24] <hellyeah> it is probably because of all has buttonClass
[05:49:29] <taplar> yes
[05:49:48] <gurke_> simply .each()
[05:50:03] <taplar> ^ that too
[05:53:16] <taplar> Renkineko: at this point I would say reversing their order to use float right would be the easiest.  other than that, the only thing i've thought of so far is you could add some padding-left to the ul to move it over
[05:53:26] <hellyeah> something looks wrong here again can you take a look http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/11/
[05:54:35] <taplar> hellyeah: each() takes optional parameters of index, element
[05:54:47] <taplar> you don't have to keep track of the counter, use the index, and set it on the element
[05:54:49] <hellyeah> yes
[05:54:53] <hellyeah> yes
[05:54:58] <hellyeah> correct
[05:55:00] <hellyeah> i forgot
[05:55:11] <taplar> also use prop, not attr
[05:55:17] <Renkineko> taplar: I would like to avoid using JS to manipulate DOM for this kind of stuff (it's an option and the application is already very JS-heavy so the less JS the better). I will try the tip I saw here : http://keith-wood.name/uitabs.html (first time wasn't good, but I didn't understand well the html architecture of the page ^^)
[05:56:05] <taplar> Renkineko: ah, sweet
[05:56:59] <hellyeah> cant i use element like that? http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/14/
[05:57:04] <hellyeah> prop
[05:57:06] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:57:19] <taplar> it's a raw element at that point.  wrap it
[05:57:20] <hellyeah> well
[05:57:30] <hellyeah> iirc prop change the dom right
[05:57:38] <taplar> yes
[05:58:00] <hellyeah> good http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/15/
[05:58:34] <taplar> you got your parameters backwards
[05:58:38] <taplar> index first
[05:59:51] <hellyeah> can i say
[05:59:55] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:00:19] <`ULTafk> heey
[06:00:27] <hellyeah> i neeed to get id of buttonClass when it is clicked i guess
[06:00:30] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:00:38] <taplar> yep
[06:00:44] <`ULTafk> i have a question about .attr("data-id") and .data("id")
[06:00:46] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:00:58] <`ULTafk> when is the one better than the other?
[06:01:11] <taplar> `ULTafk: i believe data("id") under the covers does prop("data-id")
[06:01:16] <hellyeah> attr change the variable
[06:01:20] <hellyeah> i only know that
[06:01:21] <hellyeah> :D
[06:01:51] <taplar> at the point things are in the dom, you should manipulate the dom, not the markup, typically
[06:02:05] <hellyeah> need to change this $("td").on("click", ".buttonClass", function (event) {
[06:02:20] <taplar> why?
[06:02:24] <hellyeah> hmm
[06:02:28] <hellyeah> i am just thinking
[06:02:33] <hellyeah> i dont know :X
[06:02:44] <hellyeah> humm
[06:02:51] <hellyeah> is it necessary
[06:03:00] <taplar> what's wrong with it?
[06:03:05] <hellyeah> i guess not it will know id of button
[06:03:20] <hellyeah> so buttonClass has distinctive future
[06:03:33] <hellyeah> it will remember the id of buttonClass
[06:03:41] <hellyeah> and when i refresh the papge
[06:03:55] <hellyeah> it will know which button will click
[06:03:58] <taplar> `ULTafk: if your curious http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=$.fn.data
[06:04:02] <hellyeah> trigger*
[06:04:15] <hellyeah> is it understandable what i said
[06:04:16] <`ULTafk> thank you!
[06:04:19] <`ULTafk> i will study that :p
[06:04:22] <taplar> not unless you tell it hellyeah
[06:04:38] <taplar> you'll have to use the stored id to know which one to restore
[06:04:44] <mdev> http://i.imgur.com/lVlPvCB.gif
[06:04:56] <taplar> lol
[06:04:57] <hellyeah> yes
[06:05:07] <hellyeah> i dont know how can i used stored value?
[06:05:44] <hellyeah> so thats why i thought
[06:05:54] <hellyeah> do iş need to change .buttonClass to something else
[06:06:54] <taplar> it's an id
[06:07:04] <taplar> how do you select elements by id?
[06:07:44] <hellyeah> $("#foo") selects id foo right
[06:07:49] <taplar> yup
[06:08:00] <hellyeah> okey but it is dynamically generated
[06:08:08] <taplar> so?
[06:08:10] <hellyeah> foo is not dynamical it is id
[06:08:29] <hellyeah> static id i mean
[06:08:38] <taplar> the element has an id
[06:08:42] <hellyeah> yes
[06:08:46] <taplar> the element doesn't know how it got it
[06:08:49] <taplar> it just has it
[06:09:10] <hellyeah> .buttonClass[id]
[06:09:12] <hellyeah> ?
[06:09:20] <taplar> #id
[06:09:29] <hellyeah> .buttonClass[#id]
[06:09:31] <taplar> no
[06:09:36] <taplar> just #id
[06:09:57] <hellyeah> "#id"
[06:10:07] <taplar> you'll have to concatenate the id to the '#'
[06:10:20] <hellyeah> so http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/18/ ?
[06:10:28] <hellyeah> # + id
[06:10:32] <hellyeah> thats simple
[06:10:49] <taplar> what line am i looking at?
[06:11:17] <hellyeah> 44
[06:11:25] <taplar> no
[06:11:29] <taplar> don't change your click event
[06:11:30] <Renkineko> the solution of keith wood works perfectly, thank you guys, see you :)
[06:11:42] <taplar> just how you select the element to do the click on
[06:12:10] <hellyeah> buttonClass is triggered in line 44
[06:12:21] <hellyeah> op
[06:12:22] <hellyeah> s
[06:12:24] <hellyeah> 127
[06:12:31] <taplar> line 44 is broken
[06:12:35] <taplar> leave it using the class
[06:12:42] <hellyeah> i fixed that
[06:12:49] <hellyeah> do you mean 127
[06:13:20] <taplar> i don't see you doing anything with id on 127
[06:13:31] <hellyeah> ops
[06:13:42] <hellyeah> 128 $(".buttonClass").trigger('click');
[06:14:03] <taplar> yes, you would need to use the id on that selector instead of the class
[06:14:41] <hellyeah> #id ?
[06:14:45] <hellyeah> "#id"
[06:14:47] <taplar> '#'+ id
[06:15:14] <hellyeah> hope not complaining about id is not defined
[06:15:44] <taplar> id is the variable that references the value you stored for the id in the localStorage
[06:16:46] <hellyeah> taplar: pop up window does not work http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/21/
[06:17:26] <taplar> id is undefined
[06:17:59] <taplar> you have two issues right now.  #1 your storing only "true" in your localStorage, not the id. and #2 your not getting it off of the localStorage to use it in the restoration
[06:18:07] <hellyeah> i didnt see that on console
[06:18:25] <taplar> just looking at the function, you don't have it defined
[06:18:38] <hellyeah> ic
[06:18:53] <hellyeah> i have to store button of id
[06:19:11] <hellyeah> localStorage(popup2, 2)
[06:19:14] <hellyeah> like that
[06:19:18] <taplar> brb for a sec. getting some food.  work on those two issues.  console log stuff to debug if you need to
[06:19:23] <taplar> yeah
[06:19:36] <hellyeah> how to select id of clicked button
[06:19:47] <hellyeah> taplar: have a nice launch
[06:19:51] <taplar> $(element).prop('id')
[06:21:13] <hellyeah> i am just thinking loudly thanks
[06:21:15] <hellyeah> :D
[06:38:22] <lbracher> Hi there! I'm dealing with jquery validation plugin and I would like to see which fields are being validated for real. Do you have any information on this plugin? Thanks in advance!
[06:41:40] <taplar> lbracher: you talking about this guy? http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate
[06:42:29] <notchris> I have a query spinner that is on the fritz
[06:42:34] <lbracher> taplar: yes
[06:42:45] <notchris> It keeps incrementing my value, I’ll provide an example...
[06:43:46] <hellyeah> taplar: do you mean this line 95 and line 129 http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/30/
[06:44:53] <lbracher> I'm not able to check which rules are really running, neither I'm able to see if my custom rules were accepted
[06:45:06] <lbracher> taplar *
[06:45:28] <taplar> hellyeah: ln 95 your getting the ids for everyone of the elements that has that id
[06:45:31] <taplar> err class
[06:46:28] <taplar> lbracher: not really familiar with this plugin.  you try using the debug option?
[06:46:50] <lbracher> yes. debug doesn't answer me either...
[06:46:56] <taplar> dang
[06:46:57] <hellyeah> if i give id like buttonClass + index
[06:47:02] <hellyeah> how does it sound
[06:47:31] <lbracher> taplar: I'll try other things before thinking in another strategy
[06:47:34] <taplar> hellyeah:  what are you doing on ln 97
[06:48:18] <hellyeah> i wrote the value of this to my variable?
[06:48:48] <taplar> what is 'this' ?
[06:48:54] <notchris> http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/pap7k64u/1/
[06:48:59] <hellyeah> the thing you click
[06:49:00] <hellyeah> ?
[06:49:05] <notchris> My ui spinner in that example just logs increment and decrement
[06:49:06] <notchris> However
[06:49:07] <hellyeah> it is a button
[06:49:12] <notchris> On my page, it keeps increment my value
[06:49:16] <notchris> Non-stop
[06:49:19] <notchris> For one click
[06:49:20] <taplar> but no, your setting the html of your 'this' to something
[06:49:27] <taplar> so 'this' is the button clicked
[06:50:03] <hellyeah> my variable is row information
[06:50:17] <hellyeah> when you click button it will show spesiifc row
[06:50:30] <hellyeah> wrong?
[06:51:12] <notchris> Wait figured ito ut
[06:51:13] <taplar> so 'this' is not a button
[06:51:31] <hellyeah> inut button
[06:51:35] <hellyeah> input button
[06:52:51] <hellyeah> image button
[06:53:09] <taplar> so where are you showing the modal?
[06:53:18] <taplar> err, dialog
[06:53:29] <lbracher> taplar, never mind: I discovered this plugin doesn't work on readonly fields...
[06:53:39] <taplar> nice
[06:53:39] <lbracher> thank you anyway
[06:53:50] <hellyeah> taplar:
[06:53:52] <taplar> sorry couldn't help more
[06:54:04] <hellyeah> i show it in the table
[06:54:11] <hellyeah> i don tunderstand the question
[06:54:39] <hellyeah> it returned 0
[06:54:48] <taplar> your opening a dialog
[06:54:54] <hellyeah> yes
[06:55:01] <taplar> based up on clicking a buttonClass
[06:55:02] <hellyeah> when you click buttonClass button
[06:55:06] <hellyeah> yes
[06:55:18] <taplar> where are you doing that dialog creation/opening
[06:55:27] <hellyeah> in code?
[06:55:30] <taplar> yes
[06:55:41] <hellyeah> ah okey sorry
[06:55:55] <hellyeah> between 66-107
[06:56:41] <hellyeah> .dialog creates the modal
[06:56:45] <taplar> how does that know what to display?
[06:57:16] <hellyeah> between 42-56
[06:57:19] <hellyeah> 43*
[06:57:30] <hellyeah> i add spesific row ro variable
[06:58:13] <taplar> so you have that event handler
[06:58:36] <hellyeah> yes in line 43
[06:58:36] <taplar> so any time a buttonClass is clicked that happens
[06:58:42] <hellyeah> yes
[06:58:49] <taplar> so how would you know which one was clicked?
[06:58:58] <hellyeah> 43-56 happens any time when you click
[06:59:10] <taplar> no, just genericly
[06:59:10] <hellyeah> by getting its id
[06:59:24] <taplar> in an event handler, how do you know which element was affected
[06:59:28] <hellyeah> we created dynamically
[07:00:19] <hellyeah> each line has that button that has unique id
[07:00:36] <hellyeah> thats the way i can know which elements will be effected
[07:00:43] <hellyeah> i need that id information
[07:00:45] <taplar> how do you reference what button was clicked?
[07:01:31] <taplar> brb
[07:01:35] <hellyeah> $('buttonClass')
[07:01:49] <hellyeah> console.log($(".buttonClass").prop('id'));
[07:01:55] <hellyeah> this  returns zero
[07:02:04] <Kartagis> $('.class')
[07:07:29] <taplar> that selects them all
[07:07:58] <taplar> i'll ask again.  in an event handler, how do you reference the element that is currently processing the event?
[07:09:04] <taplar> if you don't know and don't say you don't know, i'm going to keep asking, :)
[07:09:22] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:09:29] <hellyeah> spesific one
[07:09:37] <hellyeah> you are talking about i guess
[07:09:38] <hellyeah> so
[07:10:03] <hellyeah> $('buttonClass').prop('id') will select spesific id
[07:10:08] <taplar> no
[07:10:15] <taplar> that selector gets them all
[07:10:21] <taplar> you would be getting all the ids
[07:10:28] <hellyeah> ic
[07:10:42] <CaptObvious_> I'm using $.when() with 5 AJAX queries and it seems to be doing the XHR requests one after the other instead of all at the same time - is there a reason for this and/or a workaround?
[07:10:59] <hellyeah> taplar: can you give me some tips?
[07:11:00] <taplar> CaptObvious_: use done() i believe if you want one at a time
[07:11:13] <CaptObvious_> I don't want them to run one at  time
[07:11:16] <CaptObvious_> one at a time*
[07:11:19] <taplar> ah
[07:11:30] <CaptObvious_> I want them to run at together then fire a function when they're all complete
[07:11:36] <CaptObvious_> all*
[07:11:42] <taplar> hellyeah: you use 'this' in an event handler to reference the element currently processing the event
[07:11:52] <hellyeah> ah
[07:11:56] <CaptObvious_> the browser shows them starting together, but then they take 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 secs respectively
[07:12:02] <hellyeah> $(this).prop('id')
[07:12:03] <hellyeah> ?
[07:12:08] <taplar> boom!
[07:12:14] <hellyeah> hart !!
[07:12:49] <CaptObvious_> http://i.imgur.com/9Iyxbmr.png
[07:13:49] <taplar> according to the when documentation, if you give it multiple deferred elements, and do a done off of it, the done logic will only run after all of them are finished
[07:13:59] <taplar> by default they shouldn't be waiting on each other
[07:14:01] <CaptObvious_> yep, and that's fine
[07:14:02] <hellyeah> taplar: it returned 0 for all of button
[07:14:05] <CaptObvious_> but they do wait on each other
[07:14:10] <shoky> CaptObvious_: so they are running at the same time. the fact that they take long doesnt have to do with jquery most likely
[07:14:22] <hellyeah> thread
[07:14:25] <CaptObvious_> it looks like they've started so it's like they've been triggered at the same time, but it doesn't make the actual HTTP request until the previous one has finished
[07:14:26] <hellyeah> multi thread
[07:14:27] <hellyeah> :D
[07:14:38] <CaptObvious_> and this is confirmed by tailing the logs of the server
[07:14:41] <hellyeah> asynchronous
[07:14:50] <CaptObvious_> I can see the requests come through one at a time every ~3 secs
[07:14:55] <hellyeah> is it sync?
[07:15:07] <CaptObvious_> hellyeah: huh?
[07:15:10] <taplar> hellyeah: update your fiddle with the console log?
[07:15:14] <shoky> CaptObvious_ show your code
[07:15:49] <hellyeah> taplar: check line 95 and 96 http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/35/
[07:16:16] <CaptObvious_> https://gist.github.com/CaptObvious/270de8e0fff6fae394e3
[07:16:40] <hellyeah> CaptObvious_: waiting one for finishing other sound syncrinuous
[07:16:44] <taplar> hellyeah: ok, here's the thing.  at that point your in one of the handler functions for the modal
[07:16:53] <taplar> 'this' is probably not the button at that point
[07:17:04] <taplar> you need to make sure what your referencing is the button clicked
[07:17:15] <CaptObvious_> hellyeah: yes, they're running synchronously even though I want them to run asynchronously
[07:17:26] <CaptObvious_> although they don't block the main thread (the browser doesn't hang)
[07:17:53] <CaptObvious_> Chrome/Firefox makes it look like the server is taking a long time to respond (in the dev tools) but really it's because the requests aren't being made together
[07:18:22] <hellyeah> taplar: check the kline 44 http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/36/
[07:18:25] <shoky> CaptObvious_ the code looks fine. and if chrome and firefox are showing it, they are probably not lying
[07:18:36] <CaptObvious_> shoky: I can prove they are wrong
[07:18:49] <CaptObvious_> I can see the GET requests coming in on the web server logs
[07:18:51] <shoky> CaptObvious_  server logs only show what the server thinks is happening on its own side
[07:18:55] <CaptObvious_> ~3 seconds apart
[07:18:58] <taplar> hellyeah: again, your selecting all the elements
[07:18:58] <shoky> they dont show what the browser is doing
[07:19:10] <CaptObvious_> they should all come in together
[07:19:12] <shoky> CaptObvious_ but that does sound weird ;p
[07:19:14] <hellyeah> ıops
[07:19:18] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:19:22] <hellyeah> taplar: typo
[07:21:28] <hellyeah> taplar: worked
[07:21:36] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/37/
[07:22:03] <CaptObvious_> So any ideas how I'd resolve this?
[07:22:16] <taplar> alright, so now work on letting the dialog function know about that id
[07:22:39] <shoky> CaptObvious_ it sounds like a server issue to me
[07:22:44] <CaptObvious_> it's not a server issue
[07:22:54] <CaptObvious_> I've already said, I can see it's not a server issue
[07:23:09] <CaptObvious_> I can see the requests coming in and they come in 3 seconds apart instead of all together
[07:24:40] <hellyeah> taplar: can i do tis? http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/38/
[07:25:07] <shoky> CaptObvious_ you can also see the requests going out simultaneously, in the browser logs, so what?
[07:25:26] <CaptObvious_> no, I can see JS creating the XHR requests simultaneously
[07:25:27] <taplar> i'm not seeing what your doing
[07:25:41] <hellyeah> line 45 http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/39/
[07:25:45] <shoky> no you see the requests going out simultaneously in your screenshot
[07:25:47] <CaptObvious_> but it's not actually making the network connection simultaneously, it's doing them one after another
[07:26:03] <taplar> ah, yeah, you can do that, :)
[07:26:16] <CaptObvious_> the one that shows it taking 15 seconds in that screenshot takes 3 seconds if I load that URL directly
[07:26:24] <hellyeah> really
[07:26:27] <hellyeah> humm
[07:26:35] <CaptObvious_> it's not a server issue
[07:26:38] <hellyeah> i just tried my chance
[07:26:38] <hellyeah> :D
[07:26:41] <taplar> probably a good place for it too
[07:27:10] <hellyeah> yeah
[07:27:16] <CaptObvious_> and I'm not sure how many times I'm going to have to say this, but I can see the requests coming into the server and they do not come in together, they come in 3 seconds apart
[07:27:17] <hellyeah> id cannot be used inside open
[07:27:39] <hellyeah> this is okey
[07:27:40] <shoky> CaptObvious_ you don't have to say it any more times, once was enough
[07:27:40] <hellyeah> if (localStorage.getItem('popup2') === $(this).prop('id'))
[07:27:40] <CaptObvious_> like it's waiting for one response before requesting the next
[07:27:49] <CaptObvious_> shoky: obviously it wasn't
[07:27:56] <taplar> hellyeah: don't check equality
[07:27:56] <CaptObvious_> since you continued to blame the server
[07:28:02] <taplar> just check that it exists and isn't blank
[07:28:08] <taplar> or just exists
[07:28:19] <hellyeah> but i need to write smething else instea dof $(this).prop('id')
[07:28:22] <hellyeah> hmm okey
[07:28:23] <shoky> CaptObvious_ again, just cause the server log is saying something it doesnt necessarily say anything about when the requests actually went out on the client side
[07:28:25] <hellyeah> === null
[07:28:28] <hellyeah> isNull
[07:28:34] <taplar> you don't have to be explicit
[07:28:35] <shoky> there's request going out, and there's request being received. 2 different event
[07:28:38] <hellyeah> !== null
[07:28:38] <shoky> events
[07:28:40] <taplar> null is considered false
[07:28:47] <taplar> so !null is true
[07:28:48] <hellyeah> i didnt know that
[07:28:57] <hellyeah> !== null
[07:29:07] <taplar> you can, but not necessary
[07:29:17] <CaptObvious_> shoky: the server is 3 feet from the client connected to the same switch
[07:29:19] <hellyeah> humm
[07:29:20] <hellyeah> or
[07:29:31] <hellyeah> !ocalStorage.getItem('popup2')
[07:29:33] <hellyeah> right
[07:29:36] <taplar> yes!
[07:29:45] <taplar> or no
[07:29:48] <taplar> you want it to exist
[07:29:51] <taplar> so don't use the !
[07:30:03] <taplar> just get it
[07:30:09] <taplar> if it is not null, it'll be true
[07:30:26] <shoky> CaptObvious_ anyways the only 2 things i can think of that would cause something similar on the jquery side, is 1)  async: false  is being used somewhere e.g. $.ajaxSetup({async: false})  or 2) there are other requests being processed in the background, and browsers only let you have like 6 concurrent conections to the same oriign
[07:30:29] <shoky> origin
[07:30:55] <hellyeah> oh sorry
[07:31:05] <CaptObvious_> both of those are a no :(
[07:31:07] <taplar> hellyeah: http://james.padolsey.com/javascript/truthy-falsey/
[07:31:18] <shoky> CaptObvious_ then i still do believe it is a server/network issue ;)
[07:31:24] <CaptObvious_> it's not
[07:31:27] <CaptObvious_> it can't be
[07:31:28] <shoky> awesome ;)
[07:31:47] <shoky> if you got a live link to your site, i'd happily check what's going on
[07:33:47] <CaptObvious_> it's internal, sorry
[07:35:38] <hellyeah> taplar: is that true? Any problem here? http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/45/
[07:36:09] <taplar> the conditional is fine
[07:36:32] <hellyeah> but it doesnt wrok as it expected it seems
[07:36:49] <taplar> you haven't fixed what your conditional does if true
[07:37:46] <hellyeah> if give me true in that cas right
[07:37:53] <hellyeah> so this is not null
[07:38:02] <taplar> right, if that is true, what are you doing
[07:38:12] <hellyeah> i try this
[07:38:18] <hellyeah> but not working
[07:38:33] <taplar> what is wrong with ln 131?
[07:38:33] <hellyeah> if it is true i need to rremind which button is clicked
[07:38:53] <hellyeah> .buttonClass need to be changed
[07:38:57] <taplar> :)
[07:38:59] <shoky> CaptObvious_  btw unrelated to the issue but it's just a bit off that you set  contentType: 'application/json'  but your data is not actually json
[07:39:07] <hellyeah> am i true?
[07:39:39] <taplar> yes
[07:40:01] <hellyeah> okey
[07:40:10] <CaptObvious_> shoky: my data is json
[07:40:14] <hellyeah> but i dont know what to change it :D
[07:40:20] <shoky> CaptObvious_   "q=" + encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(filter))    is not json
[07:40:43] <taplar> what did you just change, and why?
[07:41:05] <hellyeah> well i changed buttonClass to this for getting spesific button id
[07:41:23] <taplar> and why?
[07:41:27] <hellyeah> and i assign spesific id to popup2 with localstorage
[07:41:41] <hellyeah> because i need spesific button not all of them
[07:42:02] <taplar> and now that you got that
[07:42:02] <hellyeah> then i check popup2 is null or not
[07:42:25] <hellyeah> it is not in this case because we clicked the button and we have an id
[07:42:40] <hellyeah> so just trigger button with that id
[07:42:46] <hellyeah> ?
[07:42:46] <taplar> go for it
[07:44:37] <hellyeah> not sure about that line
[07:44:51] <hellyeah> $(this) wont work
[07:45:02] <taplar> nope
[07:45:15] <taplar> need to use your id
[07:45:18] <hellyeah> $(".buttonClass").prop("id") wonr work
[07:45:32] <hellyeah> $("#popup2") wont work
[07:45:40] <taplar> none of those are your id
[07:46:04] <taplar> what is your id?
[07:46:27] <hellyeah> id is numbe come from button you clicked before refreshing the page
[07:46:36] <taplar> no, i mean variable wise
[07:46:38] <taplar> where is your id
[07:46:53] <hellyeah> in popup2
[07:47:03] <taplar> so....
[07:47:15] <hellyeah> localStorage.setItem("popup2", $id);
[07:47:30] <taplar> i'm agreeing it is in there
[07:47:36] <taplar> so what do you do
[07:47:53] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/51/
[07:48:14] <hellyeah> not working but improvement may be
[07:48:19] <taplar> what are doing there?
[07:48:31] <hellyeah> popup2 is not button
[07:48:36] <hellyeah> this is silly
[07:48:45] <hellyeah> you cannot trigger smt that is not button
[07:49:14] <hellyeah> wrong?
[07:49:18] <taplar> yes
[07:49:28] <hellyeah> i knew it
[07:49:46] <hellyeah> i have button
[07:49:53] <taplar> u have id
[07:49:55] <hellyeah> id of button is in popup2  variable
[07:49:58] <taplar> u don't yet have button
[07:50:32] <hellyeah> so
[07:50:36] <hellyeah> create a button
[07:50:41] <hellyeah> and give id to that button
[07:50:43] <taplar> the button exists
[07:50:45] <hellyeah> and then trigger it
[07:50:49] <taplar> you need to look it up with the id
[07:51:16] <hellyeah> $("buttonClass").prop("id") gets all button and id
[07:51:22] <taplar> yes
[07:51:23] <hellyeah> butg
[07:51:34] <hellyeah> can i use like that
[07:51:41] <hellyeah> $("buttonClass").prop("popup2") gets all button and id
[07:51:46] <taplar> no
[07:51:49] <taplar> stop, focus
[07:51:51] <taplar> where is your id
[07:52:00] <hellyeah> my id is in popup2
[07:52:04] <taplar> so use it
[07:52:24] <hellyeah> how
[07:52:33] <taplar> how are you using it for your conditional?
[07:53:17] <hellyeah> $(".buttonClass").prop("id") === "popup2"?
[07:53:21] <taplar> how are you using it for your conditional?
[07:53:33] <hellyeah> is that wron?
[07:53:35] <hellyeah> g
[07:53:38] <taplar> i'm going to keep asking
[07:53:54] <hellyeah> check button id equal to popup2
[07:54:00] <taplar> no your not
[07:54:13] <taplar> ln 130
[07:54:38] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:54:56] <hellyeah> $(".buttonClass").prop("id") === localStorage.getItem('popup2')
[07:55:16] <taplar> stop, your not understanding how your using id
[07:55:22] <taplar> what are you doing on ln 130
[07:55:35] <hellyeah> i am checking if there is id or not
[07:55:42] <taplar> ok, so if there is what does that mean
[07:55:52] <hellyeah> button is clicked
[07:56:08] <taplar> it means you have an id, right?
[07:56:13] <hellyeah> yes
[07:56:23] <taplar> ok, so that's a variable
[07:56:30] <hellyeah> id
[07:56:31] <taplar> and we want to use it to look up the button by it
[07:57:13] <hellyeah> id is variable
[07:57:15] <hellyeah> hmm
[07:57:28] <taplar> 'popup2' on the localStorage is the variable
[07:57:36] <taplar> the value just happens to be an id
[07:57:38] <hellyeah> 'popup2'
[07:57:40] <hellyeah> ye
[07:57:43] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:57:54] <hellyeah> we will use 'popup2'
[07:57:58] <taplar> ok, so localStorage.getItem('popup2') will get us our id value
[07:58:01] <hellyeah> to find button which was clicked
[07:58:18] <hellyeah> correct?
[07:58:25] <taplar> 'popup2' is just a string
[07:58:33] <taplar> it's used in the getItem function to get the value
[07:58:43] <hellyeah> so
[07:58:57] <hellyeah> var x = localStorage.getItem('popup2')
[07:59:01] <hellyeah> get the value?
[07:59:02] <taplar> go for it
[07:59:11] <hellyeah> sorry
[07:59:16] <hellyeah> i am newbie on js jquery
[07:59:20] <hellyeah> i cannot trust myself
[07:59:35] <hellyeah> i am scared to little bit to say silly things
[07:59:35] <taplar> have you done the intro pages on jquery?
[07:59:41] <taplar> don't be scared
[07:59:47] <taplar> it's a learning chatroom
[07:59:49] <hellyeah> i did jquery learning
[07:59:58] <hellyeah> there is video tuts
[08:00:07] <cardguy1000_> Is there a way to make a function fire at both the doc ready and an event like change.  I know I can make a function that is called by both the change event and at doc ready but I’m wondering if both events can be declared on one line?
[08:00:49] <taplar> same element being effected?
[08:01:00] <hellyeah> okey
[08:01:09] <taplar> you can bind to multiple events at the same time with 'event1, event2' like 'click, change'
[08:01:10] <hellyeah> in line 130 we check it is null or not
[08:01:40] <cardguy1000_> For example a textbox when a certain select is changed like $(‘#myselect’).change(function(){$(‘#mytextbox’).show();}) I want to show if either the user changes or if the on page load the php value declared for the select..
[08:01:54] <taplar> ah
[08:02:08] <taplar> not sure you can one line that
[08:03:01] <taplar> though on load you could force fire the $(element).change()
[08:04:03] <cardguy1000_> oh that’s a good idea
[08:04:40] <cardguy1000_> To fire it do you just write it like that $(element).change();
[08:06:28] <hellyeah> taplar:
[08:06:30] <hellyeah> still there
[08:06:48] <hellyeah> got the number
[08:07:15] <cardguy1000_> nm, think it’s $(element).trigger(‘change’)
[08:07:35] <`ULTafk> hello is this legit code?
[08:07:36] <`ULTafk> $(".vrijstaand").show().next().show();
[08:07:40] <`ULTafk> .vrijstand is a row
[08:07:50] <prohobo> what's next() supposed to do?
[08:07:54] <`ULTafk> so show first that row, and also the first folowing row
[08:08:26] <hellyeah> !next
[08:08:31] <hellyeah> .roulette
[08:08:31] <RA3OR> Six chambers in the gun, only One has a bullet in it.
[08:08:33] <prohobo> yeah
[08:08:37] <prohobo> seems like it should work
[08:08:49] <`ULT> yes, it works :p
[08:08:50] <hellyeah> next() is for traversing
[08:08:55] <hellyeah> do down one level
[08:08:57] <hellyeah> i suppose
[08:09:01] <prohobo> it'll show anything with the .vrijstaand tag
[08:09:07] <prohobo> and every row right after
[08:09:25] <`ULT> great. So the code is correct.
[08:09:31] <`ULT> I dont need to write:
[08:09:36] <hellyeah> yeah probably
[08:09:45] <hellyeah> if you write thead.next()
[08:09:49] <hellyeah> ops
[08:09:53] <prohobo> you just need to be careful where you put the .vrijsttand
[08:09:53] <hellyeah> if you write thead.next().next()
[08:09:58] <hellyeah> it will get all th
[08:10:03] <`ULT> $(".vrijstaand").show(); $(".vrijstaand").next().show()
[08:10:07] <hellyeah> i dont know what it is
[08:10:19] <prohobo> nope `ULT, you can chain
[08:10:26] <`ULT> thats a good thing :)
[08:10:54] <prohobo> you can keep chaining to your hearts content
[08:11:04] <prohobo> as is done in d3.js :}
[08:11:05] <`ULT> hahaa
[08:11:20] <hellyeah> taplar need little bit help
[08:11:45] <xnull> are all jquery functions :: jquery -> jquery?
[08:11:57] <`ULT> thats some pretty cool stuff on d3.js
[08:12:17] <hellyeah> what is d3.js
[08:12:25] <prohobo> data management framework
[08:12:27] <xnull> hellyeah: lmgtfy
[08:12:32] <`ULT> http://d3js.org/
[08:12:32] <prohobo> used for visualizations
[08:13:49] <hellyeah> haha
[08:14:15] <hellyeah> i want to elarn visulization
[08:15:49] <taplar> sorry got disconnected it seems
[08:16:49] <taplar> shoulda known when the room got quiet, :)
[08:21:55] <taplar> still here hellyeah ?
[08:24:15] <hellyeah> taplar
[08:24:16] <hellyeah> yes
[08:24:44] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/34kg3Lcp/59/
[08:24:47] <hellyeah> Last thing i did
[08:25:22] <taplar> yeah, so now use your id to find your button
[08:27:43] <hellyeah> taplar: is it like that http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7745748/this-findinputtype-submitnot-cancel-button-clickfunction-wh
[08:28:15] <taplar> no, it is an id, so just look it up using that
[08:29:14] <hellyeah> $("...")
[08:29:17] <taplar> yup
[08:29:50] <hellyeah> $(".buttonClass").prop(variable); wont work
[08:29:57] <taplar> your using the class there
[08:30:09] <taplar> $('#someid') is id notation
[08:30:30] <hellyeah> $('#variable')
[08:30:47] <taplar> yes, but you have to concatenate the variable to the '#' to use the value of it
[08:31:03] <hellyeah> okey
[08:31:05] <hellyeah> let me do smt
[08:31:06] <taplar> $('#'+ variable)
[08:32:24] <hellyeah> it worked
[08:32:28] <hellyeah> yay !
[08:32:35] <taplar> :)
[08:32:42] <hellyeah> but popup2 is just number
[08:32:45] <hellyeah> #1
[08:32:50] <taplar> so?
[08:33:04] <hellyeah> aha
[08:33:21] <hellyeah> we get id of button to localstorage
[08:33:28] <hellyeah> and we use that id f button
[08:33:34] <hellyeah> that triggers the button
[08:33:37] <taplar> make sense?
[08:33:43] <hellyeah> is that true?
[08:34:08] <hellyeah> it seems like make sense.
[08:34:30] <hellyeah> may be not
[08:34:31] <hellyeah> :X
[08:34:37] <taplar> what's still confusing?
[08:34:45] <hellyeah> not confusing
[08:34:51] <hellyeah> we get id
[08:34:59] <hellyeah> and we trigger the button has that i
[08:35:00] <hellyeah> d
[08:35:02] <hellyeah> thats all
[08:35:05] <taplar> yup
[08:35:12] <hellyeah> okey thanks
[08:35:14] <hellyeah> need to go
[08:35:17] <taplar> k
[08:35:27] <hellyeah> my dad is at home
[08:35:48] <taplar> show him what you learned, :)
[08:35:49] <hellyeah> actually i  would like to take care other problem
[08:36:34] <hellyeah> good day
[08:36:38] <taplar> u2
[09:11:32] <Yonben78> Hi guys, I'm looking for a little tip: I have a page with a registration form and another with a login form. They work with ajax calls. I want to put both calls in one file and include it on both page. However if I simply "merge" them in one script then some IDs are missing, how do I do that properly ?
[09:18:23] <taplar> Yonben78: you can check existance of ids to know which should happen
[09:19:15] <Yonben78> Ok thank you !
[09:19:16] <taplar> though if your executing the ajax as part of some event handling that is attached to the forms, it's not an issue
[09:19:28] <taplar> since the ajax will not execute if it can't attach to anything
[09:20:02] <taplar> if that make sense
[09:36:10] <DanyWalker> hi, i have a problem using interval
[09:36:28] <DanyWalker> http://jsfiddle.net/ffag87xp/
[09:36:46] <DanyWalker> i anna show in alert the values of "data"
[09:37:03] <taplar_food> what kinda file is this in?
[09:38:32] <DanyWalker> in my console appear: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'latitud' of undefined
[09:39:26] <taplar> so data is undefined
[09:45:18] <taplar> also looks like your missing an append operator before the data.longitud
[09:46:30] <rohdef> @DanyWalker as data is undefined I'd say it could sound like you're getting no data back from the service. I'd inspect the network traffic using the web inspector/dev tools in your browser
[09:55:25] <rohdef> DanyWalker, I see you asked the same question in #JavaScript and the talk lost track,go for the network tab in your dev tools
[09:56:48] <DanyWalker> yes, i saw
[09:56:50] <DanyWalker> thanks
[09:58:20] <rohdef> DanyWalker, you're welcome :) I think it's easier here, since it's more silent. My experience with the ajax calls is that that network tab does wonders
[10:00:33] <rindolf> Hi all.
[10:01:12] <rindolf> !ops bruncol is spamming me.
[10:01:21] <robertmaxrees> i'll take care of it.
[10:01:27] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: thanks.
[10:01:57] <rindolf> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[10:02:01] <rindolf> robertmaxrees++
[10:07:13] <`ULT> i have a table with X amount of rows, I need to display 3rd and 4rd last rows
[10:07:25] <`ULT> is this the fastest way to display?  $("tr").filter(":last").prev().prev().show().prev().show();
[10:08:10] <taplar_food> could always use nth-child
[10:08:34] <`ULT> but is that faster/ better?
[10:08:43] <taplar_food> might be a little more clear
[10:08:48] <taplar_food> what your after
[10:09:12] <taplar_food> and you could select them both at the same time so just one show
[10:09:20] <`ULT> oke thats nice.
[10:09:24] <`ULT> i would take a look
[10:12:08] <taplar_food> unless you see a problem, don't really worry about speed.  worry about readability
[10:12:24] <taplar_food> someone else coming in behind you, or yourself a month later, needs to be able to understand it
[10:12:25] <`ULT> oke, that is a good rule indeed.
[10:12:31] <`ULT> true.
[10:12:39] <`ULT> but uhm, i read the documentation
[10:12:43] <`ULT> https://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[10:13:02] <taplar_food> yeah
[10:13:13] <`ULT> can i use the nth-child from behind beheind?
[10:13:16] <`ULT> *behind
[10:13:25] <taplar> hmm?
[10:13:31] <`ULT> i dont know the value
[10:13:40] <taplar> oh, X isn't static?
[10:13:40] <`ULT> it is the 3rd and 4rd last one.
[10:13:44] <`ULT> no
[10:13:52] <taplar> well you can still compute with tr length
[10:14:18] <`ULT> hmm, but i think thats mutch more complex than prev().prev()
[10:14:32] <taplar> depends on how you write it
[10:14:55] <`ULT> i`m not a good writer :p
[10:15:03] <taplar> var $rows = $('tr'); var rowCount = $tr.length; $rows.find(....).show()
[10:15:45] <taplar> actually that last bit would be a filter not a find
[10:16:47] <taplar> var $rows = $('tr'); var rowCount = $rows.length; $rows.filter(....).show()
[10:16:48] <`ULT> var rowCount = $tr.length; you mean var rowCount = $row.length; ?
[10:16:57] <taplar> :P
[10:16:57] <`ULT> yeah thx!
[10:18:11] <`ULT> and in the filter part rowCount -2?
[10:18:14] <`ULT> something like that?
[10:18:35] <taplar> yeah, adjusting your rowCount to get the one you want
[10:18:54] <`ULT> thanks, i will try
[10:19:04] <taplar> ':nth-child('+ (rowCount - X) +'), :nth-child('+ (rowCount - Y) +')'
[10:19:33] <`ULT> but taplar, for me this is less wreatable than what I wrote before :p
[10:19:45] <taplar> then go with what's more readable to you
[10:19:58] <`ULT> but I think it is good to know this way also
[10:20:12] <taplar> sure, more tools in the toolbox is always good
[10:20:17] <`ULT> exacely for when you need to show more than 2 rows
[10:20:19] <`ULT> true!
[10:20:20] <`ULT> thanks!
[10:20:36] <`ULT> *especially
[10:21:08] <taplar> with yours you could probably include your :last in your selector and not have that filter though
[10:21:29] <`ULT> yep
[10:21:41] <`ULT> 1 moment
[10:22:19] <`ULT> To achieve the best performance when using :last to select elements, first select the elements using a pure CSS selector, then use .filter(":last").
[10:22:37] <taplar> ah, well there ya go
[10:22:41] <`ULT> ^^
[10:22:44] <robertmaxrees> https://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/
[10:23:29] <ertl> hello, I'm trying to use change() to set an input field value when a user change a select, but for some reasons nothing happens when I change it; the code is here: http://pastebin.com/CvNJ1G9R ... thanks!
[10:23:57] <robertmaxrees> ertl make a fiddle.
[10:24:15] <robertmaxrees> oh, i see why.
[10:24:18] <taplar> looks like your binding before the element exists
[10:24:18] <robertmaxrees> need a document ready.
[10:25:36] <taplar> robertmaxrees: that optimize page, does that apply to ULT's case too, since he's using tr instead of an id?
[10:25:39] <`ULT> robertmaxtrees, what method do you recommend? $('element').filter(":last"). or $('element:last')
[10:25:49] <robertmaxrees> the former.
[10:25:50] <robertmaxrees> .filter()
[10:25:56] <robertmaxrees> sizzle can be slow.
[10:26:01] <taplar> k
[10:26:20] <`ULT> thx
[10:26:25] <taplar> so guess under the covers it's doing getElementsByTagName
[10:26:31] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[10:26:52] <robertmaxrees> that's mostly under the purview of sizzle.
[10:27:18] <tocka> hi guys
[10:27:20] <taplar> going to have to google that, first i've heard of sizzle
[10:27:29] <tocka> maybe someone could help me optimise this script?
[10:27:30] <tocka> http://jsfiddle.net/xnuymhtz/13/
[10:27:32] <taplar> *sings* learning moment, lol
[10:27:43] <tocka> When it starts running and it runs for a minute or two
[10:27:55] <tocka> it starts eating up memory
[10:27:55] <robertmaxrees> tocka don't use for loops.
[10:27:56] <tocka> ;(
[10:28:03] <tocka> robertmaxrees what should I use instead?
[10:28:10] <robertmaxrees> what is this actually trying to do?
[10:28:23] <notchris> What is a better way to write this wrapping code? http://jsfiddle.net/notchris/rvwuzm3L/1/
[10:28:49] <tocka> basically im checking how big is the container and then i calculate how many <p> elements I can fit in it
[10:28:56] <tocka> and then using for loop i add them
[10:29:08] <tocka> then they appear on random one by one
[10:29:12] <tocka> as you can see in the result bar
[10:29:54] <`ULT> I like the effect tocka
[10:30:00] <tocka> thanks ult
[10:30:01] <tocka> :]
[10:30:19] <`ULT> for what are you using it?
[10:30:20] <Fleuv> Hi, how do I get previous object in an each()?
[10:30:20] <robertmaxrees> tocka so first off - for loops don't have scope.
[10:30:47] <robertmaxrees> so all those var declarations aren't working the way you think they are.
[10:30:53] <tocka> hmmm
[10:31:00] <tocka> i dont really get it :o
[10:31:13] <tocka> `ULT for a website ;)
[10:31:21] <ertl> robertmaxrees: ok, I made a fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/6da90svr/ ... I'm puzzled, the code works there!
[10:31:37] <robertmaxrees> tocka you're also never removing elements after they fade out.
[10:31:42] <robertmaxrees> which would help a small amount.
[10:31:52] <tocka> robertmaxrees why should i remove them?
[10:31:57] <robertmaxrees> tocka memory ;)
[10:32:01] <Fleuv> Hi, how do I get previous object in an each()? $(this).prev(); doesnt seem to work.
[10:32:01] <tocka> hmmmmmmmmm
[10:32:04] <robertmaxrees> ertl don't use script tags in fiddle, and right - you need to use a document ready.
[10:32:12] <tocka> robertmaxrees so I should remove the element and readd it again?
[10:32:15] <robertmaxrees> or put your code after the element you're binding to.
[10:32:36] <robertmaxrees> tocka you never check if it's already there, so yes.
[10:33:02] <robertmaxrees> also, you can rewrite that setInterval to setInterval(showTransaction, 500);, though i'd use a setTimeout call instead.
[10:33:24] <derstrom> Fleuv: Can you paste your code on jsfiddle.net. Using $(this).prev() and $(this).next() is the method I would have suggested
[10:33:47] <tocka> hmm. im kind of confused now.. i dont really get this part "	tocka you never check if it's already there, so yes."
[10:33:48] <tocka> :o
[10:33:53] <taplar> notchris: possibly http://jsfiddle.net/rvwuzm3L/2/
[10:33:58] <robertmaxrees> tocka you always just add.
[10:34:03] <Fleuv> derstrom, hold on a sec I didnt debug correctly I noticed.
[10:34:04] <tocka> yeah :o
[10:34:09] <robertmaxrees> tocka so you keep adding elements to the document.
[10:34:16] <tocka> uhm... no
[10:34:16] <robertmaxrees> and then you're having memory issues.
[10:34:20] <tocka> i added a set amount
[10:34:23] <tocka> and thats it
[10:34:23] <tocka> :o
[10:34:34] <robertmaxrees> you asked for help, i'm telling you things you need to do.
[10:34:40] <tocka> hmmmmmm
[10:35:50] <tocka> robertmaxrees what should i use instead of the for loop then?
[10:35:50] <tocka> :o
[10:36:01] <robertmaxrees> fix your variable scoping first.
[10:37:33] <tocka> robertmaxrees could you explain what is exactly wrong with it?..
[10:37:39] <robertmaxrees> for loops don't have scope.
[10:37:40] <tocka> sorry to keep bothering you
[10:37:43] <tocka> :o
[10:37:50] <robertmaxrees> so your var statements aren't doing what you think they are.
[10:38:39] <tocka> robertmaxrees what are they doing then ;o
[10:40:06] <robertmaxrees> do you understand how scope works in JS?
[10:40:51] <tocka> robertmaxrees im trying to :o
[10:41:28] <robertmaxrees> for loops don't have scope.,
[10:41:39] <robertmaxrees> functions do.
[10:42:20] <tocka> robertmaxrees sorry to ask but, could you show me what would be the right way of doing it?
[10:43:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xnuymhtz/14/
[10:43:21] <robertmaxrees> this is the first change to make.
[10:43:56] <robertmaxrees> then you should update that .one() call to remove the element after it disappears.
[10:44:11] <robertmaxrees> then I'd change that setInterval to use a recursive setTimeout call.
[10:45:41] <Fleuv> derstrom, it worked! Doesn't it work gooOOoood :D http://jsfiddle.net/Fleuv/cgphpxob/
[10:46:27] <derstrom> Fleuv: Great, congrats :)
[10:47:02] <Fleuv> now the next step! :d
[10:47:26] <tocka> robertmaxrees thanks <3
[11:15:55] <Chunk2> anyone have any experience with selectize?
[11:16:53] <robertmaxrees> Chunk2 did you have a particular question about it?
[11:19:49] <Chunk2> I'm trying to figure out how to pass multiple values via an HTML form using the get method, it DOES pass multiple values, true, but it passes them as independent variables.  When PHP gets ahold of them, it only grabs the last value in the query string.  I'm trying to figure out what I have to do to capture the individual components.  I can parse the query string manually, but there must be a better way.
[11:20:11] <Chunk2> Let me see if I can make a fiddle or something.
[11:20:38] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is on your server-side?
[11:20:49] <ZoffixWork> Hey. Is there anything patently wrong with this line of code? For some reason, I get empty <li>s every other insert: $('<li><a href="' + url + '">' + text + '</a><li>').appendTo($('#nav_main_target'));
[11:21:05] <canine> how do i check it all elements with same class name are all hidden? is(':hidden') will fire if only one of these divs with same class are hidden, i want it to fire only if ALL are hidden
[11:21:14] <canine> if*
[11:21:21] <ZoffixWork> God damn. Ask on IRC => spot the problem yourself right away
[11:21:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:21:29] <ZoffixWork> Unclosed <li> >_<
[11:21:46] <ZoffixWork> Cheers, everyone :)
[11:21:48] <Chunk2> No I think it's client side, because with other form elements I can give them a name with brackets [] at the end and PHP knows that those need to be interpreted as an array
[11:21:49] <ZoffixWork> Thanks for the help :)
[11:22:02] <Chunk2> I've misunderstood something somewhere certainly
[11:22:20] <robertmaxrees> canine you can do a .filter() and then check to see if that .length matches the .length of the selector.
[11:22:40] <robertmaxrees> Chunk2 yeah, a fiddle would be nice.  parsing form data is pretty basic stuff.
[11:24:13] <Chunk2> Oh god
[11:24:15] <Chunk2> I'm so stupid
[11:24:25] <Chunk2> I put the brackets in the class property, not the name property
[11:24:33] <robertmaxrees> "class property"?
[11:24:35] <Chunk2> thanks anyway
[11:24:45] <Chunk2> attribute sorry
[11:24:53] <Chunk2> on the HTML
[11:24:56] <robertmaxrees> oh hah
[11:24:58] <robertmaxrees> good times.
[11:26:40] <canine> checking length of is:hidden is what i want, thanks robert
[11:28:51] <DeltaHeavy> I have a .on() event with delegation that runs it's function through $.proxy for 'this'. I was wondering how I can access the element that was actually clicked on: this.$compareContentList.on('click', '.rsx-button-close', $.proxy(function (event) {
[11:29:46] <rindolf> Hi all.
[11:30:37] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy through the event object.
[11:30:41] <robertmaxrees> event.target
[11:31:07] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you should use .bind() instead of proxy unless browser support is a concern.
[11:31:24] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Oh true thanks! For some reason forgot about that and was usign event.currentTarget. Thanks!
[11:31:34] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[11:35:49] <canine> actually, i need to check length (total number) of elements that have visibility hidden
[11:35:54] <canine> not display none
[11:36:01] <canine> is hidden doesnt seem to check that
[11:36:14] <canine> nor does is visible
[11:36:58] <robertmaxrees> you can use a function for .filter()
[11:37:01] <robertmaxrees> and check the .css()
[11:38:33] <kanzure> p/win 100
[11:38:34] <kanzure> whoops
[11:45:58] <canine> robert would you be kind enough to give an example? I am looking at filter document but cant get it to work so it checks the length of visibility hidden items
[11:46:06] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[11:46:16] <canine> ok 1 secv
[11:52:31] <canine> robert: https://jsfiddle.net/yqrj0o0v/1/
[11:52:49] <canine> so when the last element is hidden, it should fire an event, alert for example
[11:52:57] <robertmaxrees> *a function, not an event ;)
[11:53:22] <canine> right
[11:53:24] <canine> thank you
[11:53:33] <tocka> robertmaxrees can you suggest anything else? :)
[11:53:33] <tocka> http://jsfiddle.net/xnuymhtz/15/
[11:54:33] <pom> I'm using jQuery to traverse XML, and sometimes I need to pass a node around, like $(xml); parseTexture(xml.find('>textures>texture')). Is is possibe to attach a value to the jQuery object that will stay attached to the derived object?
[11:56:30] <robertmaxrees> canine https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yqrj0o0v/2/
[11:56:39] <robertmaxrees> freebie - kind of a weird question :)
[11:56:44] <robertmaxrees> pom i wouldn't rely on it.
[11:56:59] <robertmaxrees> jquery and xml is a strange mix - if it were markup i'd suggest use .data() or something similar.
[11:57:39] <robertmaxrees> tocka are you having any noticable perf. issues now?
[11:57:40] <pom> robertmaxrees, I don't want to attach it to the node.
[11:57:50] <canine> aesome robert
[11:57:52] <robertmaxrees> pom then there's not really much you can do.
[11:57:53] <canine> awesome
[11:57:58] <tocka> robertmaxrees when I open the tab that contains this code
[11:57:59] <canine> robertmaxrees++
[11:58:02] <canine> thanks
[11:58:03] <tocka> CPU goes up
[11:58:03] <tocka> :|
[11:58:06] <tocka> by like 50%
[11:58:07] <robertmaxrees> tocka well, yeah...
[11:58:07] <tocka> :o
[11:58:27] <pom> Okay, thank you
[11:58:36] <robertmaxrees> that's going to happen.  crack open your profiler and figure out why, tocka
[11:58:45] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch. byeeee.
[11:59:30] <tocka> bye
[11:59:30] <tocka> :}
[12:01:56] <canine> now I got it! thanks for that again robertmaxrees
[12:03:35] <supsup> how do i use .css() to assign !important?  the stylesheet has important in it so beats anything i try to set with just .css()
[12:07:25] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/kebtoxvh/
[12:10:10] <supsup> i guess i should just switch out the class with a different class
[12:10:23] <supsup> good idea.  thanks.
[12:15:53] <supsup> http://jsfiddle.net/rxfttatr/
[12:34:53] <earational> hey
[12:41:06] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[12:53:55] <brandonjjon> Anyone know how I can run a function if a user clicks out of an input or 'it looses focis'
[12:53:58] <brandonjjon> focus*
[12:54:39] <robertmaxrees> focusout
[12:54:42] <brandonjjon> I'm building a distance calculator that will get the miles via ajax, and it will only show the miles when the user is finished typing in the move_to field.
[12:54:44] <robertmaxrees> .on('focusout', function() {});
[12:54:53] <robertmaxrees> or use the change event.,
[12:54:55] <bango2> https://api.jquery.com/focusout/
[12:54:57] <brandonjjon> Alright let me try that out.
[12:55:11] <brandonjjon> I read about that but most people were saying blur
[12:55:21] <robertmaxrees> you can also use blur.  i'd use change if i were you.
[12:55:40] <bango2> im just now reading up on blur
[12:55:41] <bango2> seems legit
[12:55:53] <robertmaxrees> that'll fire after the input loses focus but the value was actually modified.
[12:55:53] <brandonjjon> So.. what do you guys suggest jaha
[12:56:07] <robertmaxrees> change
[12:56:16] <robertmaxrees> .on('change', function() {});
[12:56:18] <brandonjjon> Ah yeah that sounds like what I need.
[12:57:46] <brandonjjon> Yep that's perfect. Thank you fellas.
[12:57:51] <robertmaxrees> #yolo
[12:57:54] <brandonjjon> xD
[12:58:15] <brandonjjon> What's your thoughts on Vue? :o
[12:58:55] <robertmaxrees> i know a lot of people love it./
[12:59:17] <robertmaxrees> i don't like the custom attribute thing it does.
[13:05:32] <brandonjjon> $('#moveFrom', '#moveTo').toggleClass('col-lg-6 col-lg-4');      Not working the way I was expecting it to
[13:05:55] <robertmaxrees> $() takes a single string.
[13:05:58] <robertmaxrees> $('#moveFrom, #moveTo').
[13:06:17] <brandonjjon> Whoops
[13:06:36] <brandonjjon> Ez
[13:06:39] <brandonjjon> Thank you again.
[13:06:41] <robertmaxrees> your current syntax is a shortcut for .find() :)
[13:11:50] <Pilotbob> Hi all, I'm trying to hide all the rows in a table that have a checkbox that has a val of true.
[13:12:00] <Pilotbob> But, doing this is too slow: $("tr", settings.tables$).each(function () {         if ($("td.row-deleted :input", this).val() == "true") {             $(this).hide();         }     });
[13:12:08] <robertmaxrees> "too slow"?
[13:12:29] <Pilotbob> yea, it takes over 1 minute to do it.
[13:12:40] <robertmaxrees> how many rows do you have?
[13:12:45] <Pilotbob> 225
[13:13:08] <Pilotbob> I'm thinking there is a better selector rather than using each.
[13:13:20] <robertmaxrees> i'd .filter() out the ones i want.
[13:13:42] <robertmaxrees> $("td.row-deleted :input", this) will be slow.
[13:14:27] <Pilotbob> robertmaxrees: so that is the slow part, or doing the each?
[13:14:35] <robertmaxrees> and also do $(this).prop('checked') or just this.checked
[13:14:37] <Pilotbob> what would you suggest?
[13:14:38] <robertmaxrees> the each will not be slow.
[13:14:47] <robertmaxrees> can you make a simplified fiddle?
[13:14:50] <robertmaxrees> just the table?
[13:15:20] <Pilotbob> Yea, I should be able to.
[13:15:57] <robertmaxrees> or http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7oxwhtpd/ is this basically it?
[13:19:23] <robertmaxrees> basically, i'd go for something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7oxwhtpd/1/
[13:19:59] <robertmaxrees> though I have no idea what your actual table looks like.
[13:26:10] <Pilotbob> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/e09vp1v2/
[13:26:22] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:27:06] <robertmaxrees> how are you controlling the checkboxes?
[13:28:10] <Pilotbob> There is a delete image with a click handler.
[13:28:36] <Pilotbob> But, this table could come from the server with some of the rows "deleted" at the jquery needs to hid it.
[13:28:45] <robertmaxrees> so hide things on pageload?
[13:28:48] <Pilotbob> yes
[13:29:03] <Pilotbob> probably not the best way, but legacy screen I'm trying to improve perf on.
[13:29:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/e09vp1v2/1/
[13:29:59] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, something like this.
[13:30:22] <robertmaxrees> you're going to have issues with hiding table rows no matter what - it's always slow.
[13:30:41] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[13:31:37] <Pilotbob> I was thinking a selector to get all the .row-delete tds where the checkbox is checked.... not sure how to do that, or if it will be faster.
[13:33:04] <cardguy1000_> Say that I have a two tables parents, children.  In the child table each record has parentID,firstName,lastName.  I’d like to run a query that returns a row for each parent, and a column for the parent which has a json or some similar aggregation of the childs firstName and lastName per parent.
[13:33:31] <cardguy1000_> oh sorry
[13:33:35] <cardguy1000_> wrong channel
[13:35:31] <Pilotbob> robertmaxrees yea, I know. I should probably add a class to the tr and just set that class's CSS to hide the row, have the server add the class each TR where the deleted filed of the model is true.
[13:37:54] <bwen> is it possible to check if there are events bound to a certain event before calling trigger ?
[13:38:49] <Pilotbob> I just thought there would be a more efficient selector to return all the tr's where the .row-deleted td has the checked input.
[13:46:16] <LindsayMac> http://thecodinglove.com/post/78026257769/when-i-forget-to-remove-the-breakpoint
[13:47:26] <robertmaxrees> helluva day
[14:06:40] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/t03Lc8k2/ - I have a weird issue, when the .change() event is triggered on the move_to field.. the animation is glitchy. But only on certain certain browsers it seems.
[14:08:16] <brandonjjon> Do you have any idea what might be causing that
[14:11:58] <robertmaxrees> as an aside - $('#BookingMoveTo').on('change', calculateDistance);
[14:12:12] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to hand it an entire anonymous function ;)
[14:12:24] <robertmaxrees> and what's glitchy, the fadeIn?
[14:13:19] <brandonjjon> Oh nice, thanks.
[14:14:40] <brandonjjon> It's the input box that's jumping down real quick then finally animating to col-sm-4 as it should. But it's that first jump that's bothersome. It's seems glitchy for me but not for a coworker. I'm on OS X/Chrome and he's tried all browsers on his Windows machine with no issues. All smooth.
[14:15:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing an issue here, either.
[14:15:04] <robertmaxrees> i'm on windows.
[14:16:07] <brandonjjon> One sec.
[14:17:45] <brandonjjon> Hmm try making the viewport a bit bigger
[14:18:03] <robertmaxrees> i'm kind of in the middle of something - have you tried profiling it?
[14:18:32] <brandonjjon> http://g.recordit.co/AWfX3RfoDe.gif
[14:18:58] <brandonjjon> Well that didn't catch it cause the gif is too slow. Oh well.
[14:19:16] <jphase> oh yeah I see it too brandonjjon
[14:19:35] <brandonjjon> At least I'm not crazy
[14:22:21] <brandonjjon> Any ideas jphase
[14:23:41] <robertmaxrees> have you tried profiling it, brandonjjon?
[14:25:04] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: No
[14:25:22] <brandonjjon> Nor familiar with doing that actually.
[14:25:23] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com has a good tutorial that'll show you how :)
[14:31:32] <jphase> that site has a few outdated/deprecated references though
[14:31:40] <jphase> but overall concepts are the same
[14:32:03] <brandonjjon> setting a breakpoint and stepping through proved to be interesting though
[14:32:17] <brandonjjon> it's strange
[14:33:10] <brandonjjon> Perhaps there is a better way to animate the class change from col-sm-6 to col-sm-4?
[14:33:24] <brandonjjon> Or an alternate
[14:33:44] <jphase> well, I tried toying around with it and I always have issues using the baked in classes in a framework and animating between
[14:34:12] <jphase> but I wasn't able to get it to act normal when just using .animate() with like... 33.33% width, for example :\
[14:34:34] <brandonjjon> Perhaps I should just re-do the layout and put the miles somewhere else. The cowards way out. D:
[14:35:05] <jphase> you could always just have a different set of markup, like have a nested row/col
[14:35:26] <jphase> so it's actually a row with 33.33% divs, and the last one is width: 0; to start, then animate it in
[14:35:36] <brandonjjon> Yeah I'll play with the markup
[14:36:07] <jphase> animating class toggles is finicky at best, and I seem to always recall having issues with webkit browsers on specific OS's, which sucks to debug :(
[14:36:19] <jphase> (with css frameworks like foundation and bootstrap that is)
[14:36:24] <brandonjjon> Yeah
[14:43:29] <Dr-007> i'd like to select a dropdown option via the name it has. not the value
[14:43:49] <Dr-007> so in html you've got <option value="1">Boombastic</option>
[14:43:58] <Dr-007> i'd like to select that option via the name Boombastic
[14:44:13] <Dr-007> should i iterate each option to compare the html?
[14:44:22] <Dr-007> or is there a better way?
[14:50:27] <jphase> Dr-007: something along the lines of $('#your-select-element').val( $('#your-select-element option[name="some_name"]).val() );
[14:55:21] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: I solved it.. I guess. Just changed the JS up a bit. https://jsfiddle.net/t03Lc8k2/2/
[15:09:38] <Dr-007> jphase thanks. im going to try it now
[15:21:40] <Dr-007> jphase; that does not work
[15:50:54] <paulvd> hello, I am setting input field values of a form using .val(), its showing the input values in the form, however its not passing through when I click submit ? The select and radio buttons are working fine, just not the input text boxes, any fix for this?
[15:51:15] <robertmaxrees> that should work just fine.
[15:51:35] <robertmaxrees> is it a normal form submit?  or is there some JS doing something for you?
[15:53:05] <paulvd> it's a normal form submit
[15:53:15] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't sound right.
[15:53:21] <robertmaxrees> .val() should set the value correctly.
[15:54:32] <paulvd> hm actually its outputting the form using js
[15:55:04] <paulvd> i have used window.load so that it sets the value after form has loaded though
[15:55:16] <robertmaxrees> don't use window.load
[15:55:18] <robertmaxrees> use document ready.
[15:57:10] <paulvd> hm
[15:57:26] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:03:55] <stallmen> guys
[16:03:59] <stallmen> should i learn this instead of js
[16:05:15] <stallmen> why is everyone ignoring me
[16:05:18] <stallmen> imf riggin mad now
[16:05:20] <stallmen> IM MAD
[16:05:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:06:03] <stallmen> robertmaxrees: shoud i learn javascripts
[16:06:06] <stallmen> or jquery
[16:06:29] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS javascript.
[16:06:32] <robertmaxrees> learn both.
[16:06:51] <stallmen> what is jquery for
[16:07:13] <robertmaxrees> it's a DOM abstraction library - makes it easier to do certain things in the browser.
[16:07:19] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:08:00] <stickperson> i’m dynamically adding elements with jquery, but they’re not being styled as specifid by my stylesheet. am i doing something wrong, or do i have to use the .css() method?
[16:08:00] <stallmen> what is a DOM
[16:08:14] <stallmen> stickperson: wait your turn
[16:08:18] <stallmen> im aking mine
[16:08:22] <stallmen> and until i get mine answered
[16:08:22] <stickperson> ha
[16:08:24] <stallmen> you can not talk
[16:08:39] <stickperson> anyway
[16:12:21] <robertmaxrees> stallmen he's allowed to talk.
[16:13:07] <robertmaxrees> stickperson sounds like your selectors aren't matching.
[16:13:12] <robertmaxrees> because the CSS should still work.
[16:13:28] <stickperson> robertmaxrees: just figured it out as soon as you responded.
[16:13:30] <stickperson> thanks
[16:13:38] <robertmaxrees> definitely!
[16:14:42] <robertmaxrees> stallmen DOM is the DOcument Object Model - it's the way javascript talks to the html and stuff.
[16:15:09] <stallmen> can u give me an example of DOM
[16:15:16] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[16:15:20] <robertmaxrees> lots of reading material out there.
[16:25:28] <stallmen> what is _ called
[16:25:55] <robertBusy> underscore
[16:26:37] <stallmen> what is this called ^
[16:26:45] <stallmen> and these bad boys { }
[16:26:58] <thealphanerd> carat & braces
[16:27:04] <thealphanerd> mmm carrot
[16:27:14] <robertBusy> have you done any tutorials stallmen?
[16:27:19] <thealphanerd> s/carat/caret
[16:27:30] <stallmen> robertBusy: no
[16:27:56] <robertBusy> stallmen hit up learn.jquery.com
[16:27:59] <robertBusy> and codecademy
[16:30:12] <stallmen> thats hard
[16:30:15] <stallmen> i dont even no js
[16:30:19] <stallmen> r u trying to kill me
[16:31:28] <robertBusy> those are good resources to learn.
[16:34:45] <stallmen> robertBusy:
[16:34:54] <stallmen> do u have ur own website
[16:36:25] <paulvd> ?
[16:37:53] <stallmen> paulvd:
[16:37:57] <stallmen> do you have ur own website
[16:38:53] <robertBusy> huh?
[16:39:16] <robertBusy> stallmen i work for a pretty large company.
[16:42:03] <stallmen> robertBusy: show me ite
[16:42:05] <stallmen> site
[16:42:11] <robertBusy> build.com is one of them.
[16:44:59] <stallmen> is it sfw
[16:45:13] <robertBusy> why wouldn't it be?
[16:54:29] <ahhughes> Im rendering  a html template... the data is an array of arrays... when iterating over the 2nd level array I need a value from the parent. I dont suppose there is a way to use ../style syntax or can I set a local variable somehow in the template that that is can be referenced within the second array?
[16:55:32] <ahhughes> ..or do I just manipulate the input data so that the sub-array has the value(s) of the parent as required?
[17:04:17] <robertmaxrees> ahhughes make a fiddle :)
[17:20:48] <walabe> someone helppp please
[17:20:59] <walabe> why doesn't any scrollTo or localscroll plugins work on ipad??
[17:21:22] <walabe> or more so, why doesn't simple <a href="#thing"></a> work on ipad
[17:23:43] <ahhughes> robertmaxrees: I think thats beyond me for this example sry... hopefully this might suffice... @ line 6 {{download.toEmail}} is trying to refer to the "parent" object. http://pastebin.com/MRBmFHvc  hopefully that explains it...
[17:24:57] <robertmaxrees> oh, within a templating system.  ahhughes you'll want to find a channel for that engine.
[17:26:39] <ahhughes> I think I just have to mash the data/obects together before they reach the templating system...
[17:28:33] <walabe> guys wtf do i do for nav on ipad
[17:28:38] <walabe> nothing works
[17:28:44] <walabe> i can't just have no nav
[17:34:33] <robertmaxrees> walabe make a fiddle or something that demonstrates the problem.
[17:34:43] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you might be doing something incorrectly.
[17:35:22] <walabe> http://chronox.comxa.com/ click any link on nav on ipad and you'll see the issue, it looks like it tries to go to correct spot, but also tries to load the top of page, hence flickering
[17:35:41] <robertmaxrees> where's the JS?
[17:36:04] <robertmaxrees> can you replicate this problem on a fiddle/outside of your site?
[17:36:37] <walabe> view source > control f > "localscroll"
[17:36:43] <walabe> i could try
[17:36:51] <robertmaxrees> please do.
[17:36:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:37:59] <robertmaxrees> without being able to play with it, it's hard to help.  It sounds like you've got something screwing around with the event object, but it's hard to know.
[17:41:03] <GenericAPI> How can I catch form data inside a listener?
[17:41:06] <GenericAPI> $(form).submit(.....)
[17:41:22] <robertmaxrees> lots of ways.  $(this).serialize() inside callback is one way.
[17:41:37] <robertmaxrees> $(this) represents the form, so you can also do any DOM traversal you'd normally do.
[17:43:33] <GenericAPI> robertmaxrees: I've tried, and it returns empty.
[17:43:46] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense.
[17:43:52] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle you can share?
[17:44:25] <GenericAPI> Oh, could it be because I have my inputs wrapped in labels?
[17:44:30] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:44:33] <robertmaxrees> that should be fine.
[17:44:56] <robertmaxrees> as long as you have a form properly wrapped and your markup is valid, you're fine.
[17:47:04] <GenericAPI> I'm pushing the change now, could I give you the URL or would you prefer a JS fiddle?
[17:47:13] <robertmaxrees> fiddles are always preferred/
[17:47:30] <robertmaxrees> that way i'm looking at just related to the form, not an entire page.
[17:48:59] <GenericAPI> I'm also working with Node, so It's not really functional on jsfiddle
[17:49:07] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:49:15] <GenericAPI> It's not that much code, could I just hand you the URL?
[17:49:15] <robertmaxrees> there's a frontend component that would be functional.
[17:49:28] <walabe> please someone help me
[17:49:34] <robertmaxrees> you could, but there's a really good chance i'll tell you to still make a fiddle :)

[17:52:40] <walabe> please
[17:52:40] <robertmaxrees> i told you how to get help :)_
[17:52:46] <walabe> i can't
[17:52:55] <GenericAPI> walabe: Just ask.
[17:53:20] <walabe> nav won't work on ipad
[17:53:24] <GenericAPI> I see, you added e.preventDefault()
[17:53:24] <walabe> i'm assuming safari as well
[17:53:35] <robertmaxrees> walabe "doesn't work"?  it's unemployed?
[17:53:42] <GenericAPI> walabe: Thanks for clearly explaining your issue.
[17:53:47] <walabe> i'm going to remove all js, and then ask you again
[17:53:50] <robertmaxrees> GenericAPI you can ignore that bit - i was pointing out all you needed to make the fiddle ;)
[17:54:11] <robertmaxrees> and this is your issue: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/yq4ss5fz/1/
[17:54:20] <GenericAPI> robertmaxrees: Not a problem, I've heard worse on IRC :-)
[17:54:33] <robertmaxrees> GenericAPI you needed to give your inputs name attributes
[17:55:10] <robertmaxrees> walabe i see a console error.
[17:55:30] <walabe> hold on i'm going to remove all js
[17:55:32] <walabe> on nav
[17:55:33] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[17:55:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:55:41] <walabe> what
[17:55:50] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be amazing.
[17:56:15] <walabe> there won't be any js
[17:56:23] <walabe> oh right im on a js chat
[17:56:25] <robertmaxrees> you're aslo assuming i have an ipad
[17:56:31] <walabe> exactly
[17:56:38] <GreatDanton> lol
[17:56:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:56:43] <walabe> can someone test if it works on ios
[17:56:52] <walabe> if anyone has that
[17:56:56] <robertmaxrees> have you tried the dev tools in chrome?
[17:57:06] <walabe> ? it works fine on chrome
[17:57:15] <robertmaxrees> it has device emulation.
[17:57:42] <robertmaxrees> see if that reproduces your issue.
[17:57:57] <walabe> no works fine on that, thanks btw didn't know chrome had that
[17:57:59] <robertmaxrees> if not, i'd look for a testing setup somewhere.
[17:58:08] <robertmaxrees> instead of relying on having us be your guinea pigs.
[17:58:37] <walabe> i've TESTED it and it doesn't work
[17:58:49] <robertmaxrees> so you have an ipad you can use?
[17:58:52] <walabe> yes
[17:59:06] <walabe> why won't it work on ipad the stupid <a> crap links
[17:59:08] <robertmaxrees> then use a remote debugger.
[17:59:46] <walabe> i hate this so much
[18:02:17] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you might need to take a break.
[18:03:59] <walabe> been trying to fix this 2 days, and really need to be finished right now
[18:08:54] <walabe> this should work in ipad / safari right??? <a href="#specs">Specs</a>
[18:09:07] <robertmaxrees> yep.  so long as that's a valid ID on the page.
[18:09:11] <robertmaxrees> what does the markup look like?
[18:10:00] <walabe> sorry what does that mean
[18:10:12] <robertmaxrees> is there an element with the ID of "specs"?
[18:10:24] <robertmaxrees> did you make a mistake and call it id="#specs"?
[18:10:30] <robertmaxrees> are there multiple elements with that ID?
[18:10:33] <robertmaxrees> that sort of stuff.
[18:11:01] <walabe> <div id="specs" class="partswrapper">
[18:11:14] <robertmaxrees> and that's the only element with that ID?
[18:11:20] <walabe> yes
[18:11:39] <robertmaxrees> try $('[id="specs"]').length in your console.
[18:11:40] <walabe> it looks like it tries to go to the ID, but then also tries to go to the top of the page, e.g. #
[18:11:41] <robertmaxrees> make sure.
[18:12:03] <walabe> 1
[18:12:08] <robertmaxrees> if that really does return 1, then you have JS conflicting.  Remove everything touching the page scroll.
[18:15:26] <walabe> still not working :(
[18:15:36] <robertmaxrees> any console errors
[18:15:36] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:15:54] <walabe> chronox.comxa.com there's not js for scrolling and just plain <a href's
[18:16:12] <walabe> no console errors
[18:16:28] <robertmaxrees> you still have JS in there.
[18:16:40] <walabe> yes for other things
[18:16:44] <robertmaxrees> for the navbar.
[18:16:48] <robertmaxrees> i'm still getting smooth scrolling.
[18:16:53] <robertmaxrees> also you have two copies of jquery.
[18:17:11] <walabe> wtf how is it still smooth scrolling this is crazy
[18:17:59] <walabe> which version of jquery should i delete
[18:18:13] <robertmaxrees> what browser support do you want?
[18:18:20] <robertmaxrees> and //  Find any element starting with a # in the URL - this comment starts your smooth scroll code.
[18:19:16] <walabe> would this script be interferring causing the issues? it's for my slider http://jsfiddle.net/dwxya2jj/
[18:19:30] <walabe> there shouldn't be any js related to smooth scroll
[18:19:40] <robertmaxrees> that block is only for smooth scroll.
[18:19:55] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/YqNF8iE.png
[18:20:09] <robertmaxrees> delete that duder.
[18:20:18] <walabe> ohhhh
[18:20:28] <robertmaxrees> that's probably what's causing your bugs.
[18:22:39] <walabe> YAY
[18:22:44] <robertmaxrees> yw
[18:22:47] <walabe> It's working perfectly
[18:22:52] <walabe> i love you thank you very very much
[18:49:07] <ISmithers> Hey all, does anyone know of a social feed plugin that can display facebook/twitter posts, similar to how AddThis functions - where you pay a sub and import their code from their site directly, rather than downloading a js file and including it.
[18:52:26] <acidjazz> pay a sub
[18:52:31] <acidjazz> and import their code..
[18:52:38] <acidjazz> like server-side code?
[18:52:55] <ISmithers> Are you familiar with AddThis acidjazz?
[18:53:35] <acidjazz> sort of
[18:53:37] <acidjazz> shrae buttons?
[18:53:42] <ISmithers> Yeah
[18:54:25] <ISmithers> Essentially they host a .js file on their site, and via a token auth system, you can import it using something like <script type="text/javascript" src="//s7.addthis.com/js/300/addthis_widget.js#pubid=<some token thing here>" async="async"></script>
[18:54:35] <acidjazz> right
[18:54:39] <acidjazz> and you dont want that right
[18:54:40] <ISmithers> That way they maintain the plugin and code, so if for whatever reason the social apis change, you don't worry about it.
[18:54:45] <ISmithers> No I do want that.
[18:55:03] <acidjazz> oh you're looking for a free version
[18:55:18] <ISmithers> No I don't mind paid, but I want it for streams, not sharing buttons. ie Facebook/Twitter feeds.
[18:55:40] <acidjazz> you want to show widgets of facebook/twitter data?
[18:55:56] <ISmithers> Check this page right at the bottom http://unicornfoundation.org.au/
[18:56:15] <ISmithers> So that's once I've done before, and those social feeds are coming from Facebook/Twitter using their embed code. But its a bit limited.
[18:56:24] <acidjazz> i see yea
[18:56:35] <acidjazz> yea twitter has its own
[18:56:39] <acidjazz> facebook yea
[18:56:39] <ISmithers> If I want to style it nicely, or use a bunch of nice css/jquery animations I can't really.
[18:56:55] <ISmithers> I _could_ tunnel down into the iframes, but its not the best way to go about it.
[18:56:59] <acidjazz> no you gotta give that real estate up
[18:57:25] <ISmithers> So I was hoping to find a paid plugin, similar to AddThis but for social feeds instead, which would allow me a bit more flexibility.
[18:58:15] <acidjazz> how about this https://github.com/iatek/jquery-socialist
[18:59:07] <ISmithers> Yeah I have looked at that one just now in fact. I do like it.
[18:59:25] <ISmithers> I just was curious if there are any which instead of <script src='../jquery.socialist.js'></script> allow you to link to the js on their site (similar to AddThis).
[18:59:36] <walabe> hello
[18:59:36] <ISmithers> Which is why I was thinking paid may be the way to go, since usually they will charge for that service.
[19:00:11] <walabe> can someone help me with my script http://jsfiddle.net/L0b60pnf/ this script was made for scrollTo but i want it not for scrollTo, but just regular <a>s
[19:00:25] <walabe> how would i remove the scrollTo and just have it talking about <a>
[19:00:50] <walabe> to prevent default scrolling to the top page when href=#
[19:01:43] <acidjazz> ISmithers: well if you cant find a paid one close to what you want let me know and we'll build one and make $$$
[19:04:01] <walabe> how do i stop <a href=#></a> taking me to the top of the page with JS
[19:04:52] <ISmithers> Haha thanks acidjazz, I think if we go down that route we can develop it. :p
[19:05:03] <ISmithers> walabe: I think its e.PreventDefault();
[19:05:22] <acidjazz> for sure
[19:05:31] <ISmithers> ie Block the default event functionality.
[19:06:03] <walabe> yay got it
[19:06:16] <acidjazz> walabe: or return false in yoru handler
[19:16:53] <jquery14> so i have three buttons but want to use one id for all three because if not i would literally use the same exact function three times just with different names. If someone is willing to help i have a jsfiddle of the part that i need help with
[19:17:36] <shoky> jquery14: that's what a class is for, not an id
[19:17:51] <shoky> id's must be unique
[19:17:51] <jquery14> -_-
[19:18:00] <jquery14> haha wow
[19:18:24] <jquery14> I wasn't even thinking about using a class, thank you ill go fix it
[19:18:38] <ISmithers> lol :)
[19:23:25] <jquery14> for some reason when I change it to class the click function doesn't work at all. No error and I've placed a console.log message inside and Im not recieving it
[19:23:38] <jquery14> and yes I added a period instead of a #
[19:27:11] <jquery14> anybody?
[19:28:06] <ISmithers> There is probably jQuery looking for the ID selector still jquery14?
[19:28:26] <jquery14> I refreshed the page, is this what oyu mean?
[19:29:19] <jquery14> http://jsfiddle.net/sq60282g/
[19:29:58] <jquery14> so the way it is on that fiddle page it works, but if I change it to a class it doesnt work
[19:32:36] <ISmithers> Yeah the jQuery selection #favorite
[19:32:50] <jquery14> i changed it to .favorite
[19:32:53] <ISmithers> So it would need to become .favorite
[19:33:02] <ISmithers> So $('.favourite')...etc
[19:33:06] <jquery14> yea doesnt work
[19:33:49] <ISmithers> Yeah it does.
[19:33:55] <ISmithers> http://jsfiddle.net/sq60282g/1/
[19:33:59] <jquery14> I've been trying it
[19:34:03] <ISmithers> ^^
[19:34:27] <jquery14> yea it works on there but for some reason not in my actaul document
[19:34:37] <jquery14> Ill keep fiddling with it i guess
[19:34:52] <jquery14> should be that simple i know but i wasnt working
[19:37:29] <jquery14> yea it's not working
[19:37:44] <jquery14> but if I change it back to id and change it to #favorite it works
[19:41:03] <jquery14> http://jsfiddle.net/sq60282g/1/ this works on fiddle but It doesnt work locally on my actual page, any Idea why not? If i change the class's to Id's and change the click function to #favorite it works, it's just when I make them class's that it doesn't
[19:43:27] <Robdgreat> must be something on your actual page that's causing it to not work
[19:44:05] <MrStubbs> could post a gist of it if you want
[19:44:05] <Robdgreat> since all I can see is working code, I can only speculate about the unseen non-working code
[19:44:12] <jquery14> yea but I have no idea what, all I do is change the from being id's to  being class's and suddenly it doesn't work
[19:44:26] <jquery14> my code looks exactly the same but doesn't work
[19:44:45] <Robdgreat> your actual page doesn't have other things there in addition to what's in the gist?
[19:45:06] <Robdgreat> whether it's ids or classes shouldn't break things
[19:45:08] <jquery14> well yea but as far as those sections go its exactly the same
[19:45:31] <Robdgreat> that's my point
[19:45:45] <Robdgreat> you have other things on the page that are obviously causing some sort of conflict or something
[19:45:53] <Robdgreat> again, I can only speculate
[19:46:07] <jquery14> Any idea what could prevent class's from working? or you would just have to see the entire project?
[19:46:36] <jquery14> yea I understand, just didn't know if there was something I was missing becasue it works perfect in jfiddle
[19:49:27] <Robdgreat> the reason it works perfect in jfiddle is the part of your actual page that's causing the problem isn't present
[19:49:44] <Robdgreat> that's something I can safely deduce from the fact that it works there but not on your page
[19:50:01] <Robdgreat> would it be possible to see your page?
[19:50:02] <jquery14> yea I found the issue, just me being dumb
[19:50:05] <Robdgreat> sweet
[19:50:10] <jquery14> thank you for your time
[19:50:17] <Robdgreat> hope I was helpful
[19:50:42] <jquery14> you were, I looked to see what was different between my page and the jsfiddle one
[19:50:54] <jquery14> like you suggested
[19:51:25] <Robdgreat> excellent :)
[19:51:37] <Robdgreat> mind sharing the cause of the issue?
[19:52:36] <jquery14> not at all. basically I was declaring two classes on one element. I had class="btn btn-default btn-block btn-lg" class="favorite" so I just had to move favorite inside the first class
[19:53:06] <jquery14> I deleted the bootstrap because I thought it would just be clutter for anyone helping me
[20:06:16] <Robdgreat> yeah, redacting code often obscures the problem
[21:10:43] <acidjazz> redact for obscurtity
[21:29:24] <tash> I want to access the html of a specific <td> in my table. I'm able to console.log the html from every <td> but how can I get the one specific <td>?  none of the <td>'s have id's and not sure if they should or not.
[21:29:59] <tash> http://pastie.org/10332621
[21:45:13] <tash> anyone?
[22:47:04] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[22:55:59] <Whiskey> var images = {bg: document.getElementById('clockBackground'), numbers: document.getElementById('clockNumbers')}; <-- is it possible to make jQuery load in this from URL insted, i have callback javascript for it but what hoping it could be alot less code whit some jQuery
[22:59:38] <sadtaco> I have some radio buttons and clicking them doesn't actual make them checked. Can't make a jsfiddle because it's a lot of code. But is there a way to figure out what might be stopping the bubbling of the event that makes them checked? I'm guessing there's a .preventDefault() somewhere that effects them.
[23:17:28] <morphyeys> good morning guys
[23:31:29] <hellyeah> hey
[23:31:37] <hellyeah> anyone knows about modal window?
[23:32:42] <hellyeah> oh man whatis wrong with jsfiddle?
[23:34:14] <morphyeys> hellyeah, I know and ?
[23:34:41] <hellyeah> just a sec
[23:35:07] <hellyeah> jsfiddle has a problem
[23:35:16] <hellyeah> i need to put my code into jsbin
[23:38:59] <hellyeah> morphyeys:  do you know what the problem is here https://jsbin.com/hugimazeku/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[23:39:58] <morphyeys> hellyeah, I am noob, but to use bootstrap modals is easy?
[23:40:04] <morphyeys> are you using bootstrap?
[23:41:44] <hellyeah> no
[23:41:51] <morphyeys> why not?
[23:42:01] <hellyeah> i used jquery modal
[23:42:53] <morphyeys> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals
[23:43:00] <morphyeys> hellyeah, plugin or what?
[23:45:47] <hellyeah> morphyeys: i have multiple modals
[23:45:49] <hellyeah> Multiple open modals not supported
[23:45:49] <hellyeah> Be sure not to open a modal while another is still visible. Showing more than one modal at a time requires custom code.
[23:45:57] <hellyeah> so it is not suitable for my purpose
[23:46:07] <morphyeys> okay
[23:46:16] <morphyeys> I am total newbie with JS and jQuery
[23:46:19] <morphyeys> sorry
[23:47:30] <hellyeah> no problem
