[00:00:06] <MrS1lentcz> hello, i have troubles with ajax method. ajax is calling "fail" callback after the start immediately with code and error "abort" and "success" callback if response was incomed. why just abort?
[00:00:32] <Cork> zChris: it will, if the value is something that is inherited by the children
[00:01:17] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: something is aborting the connection
[00:01:31] <Cork> as in calling xhr.abort()
[00:02:43] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: mmm "something"... how can i find out what?
[00:03:10] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: you could start by looking for the .about() code call
[00:21:52] <raj> how can I get details on the `data` object so I know what attributes it has https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options
[00:22:26] <raj> such as `data.jqXHR` https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options#done
[00:23:09] <Cork> raj: inspect the object
[00:25:58] <raj> grrr
[00:26:28] <raj> it doesn't ordinarily have a data.jqXHR
[00:26:38] <raj> that's why I was trying to look up how to make it happen
[00:30:42] <raj`> what're the arguments passed to a named eventhandler function?
[00:30:53] <raj`> `event` is first of course
[00:30:53] <b-ot> raj`: memorised “event`”.
[00:42:27] <Cork> raj`: there isn't a generic answer to your question
[00:42:45] <Cork> raj`: it depends on how the plugin forwards the event to you
[00:44:15] <sunbeam> whatst he best way to send a request using ajax?
[00:44:19] <sunbeam> $.post? or $.ajax?
[00:44:46] <Cork> sunbeam: $.post and $.get is a shorthand for $.ajax
[00:44:49] <phiz> $.post is just shorthand for $.ajax
[00:44:51] <Cork> in the end it is the same thing
[00:45:06] <phiz> d'oh i type too slow
[00:45:28] <phiz> see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[00:46:07] <raj`> ok, thanks Cork
[00:47:22] <sunbeam> Cork: so using $.ajax is ok?
[00:47:32] <Cork> yes
[00:48:02] <Cork> i more or less never use $.post or $.get my self, $.ajax is almost as short, and you have a lot more power at your hands
[00:48:21] <sunbeam> oki
[00:48:32] <raj`> I'm doing `$('.start').on('click', function(ev){ ev.preventDefault(); alert('hi'); })` but it's still submitting the form. `.start` is a <button> within a <form>
[00:48:34] <jop008> how do I resize a td or tr element?
[00:48:55] <jop008> I tried .css height and top-margin but nothing is happening
[00:48:55] <raj`> jop008, adjust it's css
[00:48:56] <Cork> raj`: click won't prevent the submit event
[00:49:11] <raj`> oh, what would?
[00:49:22] <jop008> I try to do it by changing css
[00:49:35] <Cork> jop008: td adjust there width/height to the surrounding elements
[00:49:39] <jop008> but what is the proper css for this
[00:49:43] <Cork> jop008: and tr doesn't have a height
[00:49:53] <jop008> td?
[00:49:54] <Cork> height/width is the css
[00:50:21] <jop008> so resize with td.css height ?
[00:50:26] <Cork> jop008: what i meant is that you will have limited success resizing table cells, and none ofr tr
[00:50:37] <Cork> jop008: what are you talking about?
[00:50:53] <Cork> ah, coffie
[00:51:03] <raj`> :)
[00:51:05] <jop008> my picture is rotated and breaks out of it cell box
[00:51:07] <Cork> hmm then i think it would be td.css '
[00:51:09] <Cork> bah
[00:51:18] <Cork> hmm then i think it would be td.css 'height value
[00:51:21] <Cork> -_-'
[00:51:24] <jop008> top-margin on the img doesn't help
[00:51:27] <Cork> * td.css 'height' value
[00:51:43] <Cork> jop008: there is no css called top-margin
[00:51:50] <raj`> or padding on the cell
[00:51:58] <raj`> to prevent breaking out
[00:52:01] <jop008> parent = this.thumbjq.parent ("td");     parent.css ("height:800"); like this
[00:52:10] <Cork> jop008: no
[00:52:24] <Cork> parent.css ("height", "800px")
[00:52:35] <Cork> or parent.height(800)
[00:52:55] <Cork> also note that parent('td') is most of the time point less
[00:53:07] <Cork> and you most of the time want closest('td') instead
[00:53:38] <Cork> parent('td') will grab the direct parent of the element, and if it is of type td return it, else return nothing
[00:54:04] <raj> Cork, can I prevent submission of the form?
[00:54:19] <Cork> raj: you would have to grab the form element and bind the submit event
[00:54:31] <raj> oh
[00:55:55] <raj> so add a `$('.start').on('submit', function(ev){ev.preventDefault()})` ?
[00:55:58] <raj> not working
[00:56:17] <raj> oh wait, nm
[00:56:21] <raj> wait, yes
[00:56:23] <raj> it's not working
[00:56:37] <Cork> if .start is the form yes it would work
[00:56:43] <raj> oh
[00:56:45] <raj> i see
[00:56:46] <raj> ok
[00:56:46] <Cork> if .start is a button or link or something, then no
[00:57:45] <raj> understood
[00:57:46] <raj> now it works
[00:57:47] <raj> thanks you
[00:57:53] <Cork> np
[00:58:13] <raj> how can I make sure a function is only bound once?
[00:58:54] <raj> so that clickhandler won't execute twice if the button is clicked
[00:59:37] <raj> without a global
[00:59:50] <Cork> raj: simplest is normally to bind them statically
[00:59:58] <raj> meaning?
[01:00:21] <Cork> using delegated event listeners, and then not binding them as you add or remove elements
[01:00:37] <Cork> alternatively you can add a namescope to the event listener
[01:00:47] <Cork> and then unbind based on that before you bind the event handler
[01:01:02] <Cork> on('submit.my-super-private-namespace')
[01:01:07] <Cork> off('submit.my-super-private-namespace')
[01:01:08] <raj> I see
[01:01:12] <Cork> or just off(.my-super-private-namespace')
[01:01:25] <Cork> * off('.my-super-private-namespace')
[01:04:31] <raj> wondering what the best way is, because if I add 2 files for multifile-upload ( code here--> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/issues/1227 ), it binds the clickhandler twice...thus causing `fileuploadsubmit` event to run twice
[01:04:31] <b-ot> raj: Issue #1227 by thapar (15mon 2w ago): Trying to POST multiple files in a single request
[01:06:22] <msaads_> Anyone knows how to solve Jumpy page transitions issue on jQuery mobile Phonegap Android platform? http://bit.ly/1cCdcRW
[01:06:55] <Cork> raj: so like i said, bind the event listener statically, instead of dynamically
[01:07:06] <raj> how so?
[01:07:34] <Cork> raj: bind the event listener on the upload element parent, and delegate the events there
[01:07:50] <Cork> that way you won't need to add additional listeners when new elements is added
[01:08:16] <raj> but I need the `data` object
[01:08:31] <Cork> so?
[01:08:33] <raj> to do data.submit()
[01:08:51] <Cork> ah
[01:08:59] <raj> I'm misunderstanding "bind the event listener on the upload element parent"
[01:09:06] <raj> i think
[01:16:09] <Cork> raj: ok, it looks a bit badly documented, but from https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/API
[01:16:21] <Cork> it looks like you can call fielupdate with add and send to trigger those actions
[01:16:32] <Cork> it might have a clear or similar too
[01:16:50] <Cork> if you use those instead you won't need to use the dynamic event bindings
[01:17:56] <msaads_> Jumpy page transitions issue is there for like 3 years by now. So I was wondering if someone has a work-around for it?
[01:19:16] <raj> Cork, I don't see `fileupdate` mentioned on that page
[01:19:40] <Cork> raj: sorry fileupload not update :x
[01:41:48] <raj> thanks Cork
[02:27:34] <code_ph0y> hey guys how do you get the offsetTop ?

[02:36:03] <jagan123> How to resolve this.. ?
[02:46:58] <Cork> jagan123: you can't do xss uploads to amazonas.com
[02:47:16] <Cork> jagan123: only option is to proxy it over your own domain
[02:48:09] <ravenzz> does jQuery have any util to serialize js objects?
[02:50:23] <Cork> ravenzz: normally you don't need to
[02:50:31] <Cork> just use the browsers built in JSON object
[02:50:44] <Cork> you might need to load json2.js for older ie though
[02:50:48] <Cork> (pre ie9)
[02:51:07] <ravenzz> I don't want to serialize into a json object
[02:51:09] <asDASD_> LOL
[02:51:18] <Cork> ravenzz: uh
[02:51:23] <ravenzz> but convert { foo: "foo" } into a string
[02:51:25] <faraway> ravenzz: then you need to explain what you mean with serialize ;)
[02:51:26] <ravenzz> foo=foo
[02:51:39] <ravenzz> ?serialize
[02:51:53] <Cork> ravenzz: $.params()
[02:51:59] <ravenzz> well this http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[02:52:10] <Cork> what your looking for is parameterizing the object
[02:52:16] <ravenzz> alright
[02:52:32] <ravenzz> my  bad, or my crappy english's bad :)
[02:52:34] <Cork> it has nothing to do with json :)
[02:52:42] <ravenzz> I know
[02:52:59] <ravenzz> it is param() though
[02:53:51] <ravenzz> great that's exactly what I was looking for, thank you
[02:54:15] <jagan123> Hi, Cork. if I try to upload using firefox its working fine..But i was tried with chrome it doesnt
[03:11:36] <Cork> jagan123: are your firefox up to date?
[03:17:01] <jop008> I do this .button('refresh'); but button is not refreshed
[03:21:50] <doug65536> jop008: why would you have to "refresh" a button? am I missing something?
[03:25:17] <doug65536> jop008: there's no such function "button" that I am aware of. what plugin is it from
[03:25:50] <jop008> I read it on the documentation
[03:26:08] <doug65536> what documentation? jquery core? ui? what?
[03:26:12] <jop008> http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/buttons/buttons-methods.html
[03:27:23] <doug65536> jop008: probably an error in your script. do you have a javascript debugger?
[03:27:49] <jop008> of couse I see this  cannot call methods on button prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'
[03:28:08] <jop008> I build chtml string and do a .html ()
[03:28:10] <doug65536> jop008: are you doing it in document.ready?
[03:28:18] <jop008> then I refresh the buttons
[03:28:20] <doug65536> jop008: can you show code?
[03:28:20] <obert> how to generate a list from a folder, link should have filename without .html
[03:28:27] <jop008> yes in doc ready
[03:30:08] <doug65536> obert: put something on server side (like php) to give you a json response. query it with an ajax call, then build list from result
[03:32:28] <doug65536> jop008: are you modifying the dom of the button somehow?
[03:32:31] <jop008> how do I know when this is rendered   this.folderplaceholder.html (chtml);
[03:32:45] <jop008> No I create 4 buttons in a tbody
[03:33:12] <jop008> so there were no buttons I injected them with a html string .html ()
[03:33:48] <doug65536> jop008: that's probably your problem
[03:35:15] <jop008> but how to fix it?
[03:35:55] <doug65536> jop008: not sure. looking...
[03:36:58] <doug65536> jop008: can you show code snipped on gist.github.com?
[03:38:15] <jop008> this is the code http://pastebin.com/AkbcBiz1
[03:39:09] <doug65536> jop008: why setTimeout? you should be able to immediately access the new elements
[03:39:52] <doug65536> 'this' is probably wrong in that callback
[03:40:30] <jop008> that fails
[03:40:43] <doug65536> jop008: if you're sure you need setTimeout, try this: http://pastebin.com/s38Ci6dv
[03:41:03] <doug65536> see line 11 and 15
[03:43:13] <jop008> I put it like this for (var i=0;i<nlen;i++) { var oel = $ ("#folder_" + i ); if (!isnull (oel)) { oel.button ("refresh");
[03:43:47] <doug65536> ok, as long as you aren't relying on 'this' being correct in settimeout callback
[03:44:49] <doug65536> why though? my snippet would be way faster
[03:46:08] <jop008> Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on button prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'refresh'
[03:46:49] <jop008> how to initialize?
[03:47:22] <doug65536> see bottom of this page http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.0rc1/docs/buttons/buttons-options.html
[03:47:54] <doug65536> make a class name for your button(s) and set the initSelector to that class name selector
[03:51:06] <doug65536> jop008: or add class="button" to it (I think that is the default)
[03:51:21] <doug65536> or add class name to classes already there, you know what I mean
[03:52:45] <jop008> okay
[03:53:11] <Tomashe> hey guys data-position="fixed" with jquery mobile is not working
[03:53:12] <Tomashe> any ideas?
[03:53:27] <jop008> <td><a href='#' class=''button'  no effect
[03:53:46] <doug65536> jop008: what? class="button"
[03:53:52] <doug65536> no ''button'
[03:53:55] <doug65536> not*
[03:54:40] <jop008> I can make a try catch in a loop waiting to succeed
[03:54:55] <doug65536> jop008: that won't work. it's not concurrent
[03:55:34] <doug65536> jop008: you know how to put a double-quote there right?
[03:55:52] <doug65536> shift+<the key beside enter>
[03:56:11] <doug65536> on usa keyboard anyway
[03:56:28] <jop008> not kidding me
[03:56:37] <jop008> what do you want to tell?
[03:58:12] <doug65536> single quotes are allowed. you have 2 of them before button
[04:00:41] <paulvd> is here a free script similar to jcarousel
[04:02:11] <xec_> about a thousand
[04:02:17] <seutje> and one!
[04:02:45] <doug65536> jop008: I'm trying to recreate problem on jsfiddle
[04:08:08] <paulvd> good
[04:08:09] <Kuba_> Hi, I have question about jQuery Mobile. I have my own script on the page, which adding/removing class from <li> tag, script works fine until I change adress from hostname.cc/ to hostname.cc/index.php. After this i must reload page in browser to let script work again. I'm using this method: $(document).on('pageinit', function() {... Please, can anyone tell me what I could do wrong?
[04:09:27] <doug65536> jop008: this recreates your problem: http://jsfiddle.net/35ygF/10/
[04:11:57] <mrHAT> this is the php number_format() ported to js : https://github.com/kvz/phpjs/blob/master/functions/strings/number_format.js  is there another way to do this without using so much code ?
[04:13:39] <seutje> mrHAT: if you want the output as a string and you want explicit control over the decimal and thousands denominators, probably not
[04:14:16] <seutje> this isn't even a lot
[04:15:51] <rawrzors> -.- coming to jquery from c/python ... I already hate it
[04:16:13] <rawrzors> lol
[04:16:35] <doug65536> jop008: you still there?
[04:19:04] <doug65536> rawrzors: learn Lua first, then javascript. you'll like js
[04:19:37] <doug65536> rawrzors: js is a ripoff of Lua anyway
[04:21:17] <rawrzors> doug65536 LOL nothx..... I really only NEED jQuery for a modal form I want to add to my website on load.. unfortunately it's got many other reasons I should learn it (web development jobs) so I'm doing it... *sigh* I'm more of a "background function" type
[04:21:41] <doug65536> rawrzors: you can do async stuff very easily with jquery
[04:22:15] <doug65536> rawrzors: there is a jquery ui plugin, adds forms like you describe
[04:22:44] <doug65536> rawrzors: what do you mean by "modal" though? like win32 modal?
[04:23:14] <rawrzors> pop up form with dimmed unclickable overlay
[04:23:40] <rawrzors> basically i want people to have to enter "valid" information in order to access the site
[04:23:45] <rawrzors> but in a pretty way
[04:23:57] <doug65536> ok, do that then, make a partially transparent div with fixed position, then make form div in it
[04:24:09] <Vivekananda> hey guys
[04:24:11] <rawrzors> then just hide it on submit?
[04:24:17] <doug65536> rawrzors: sure
[04:24:24] <Vivekananda> can someone recommend a good book for json jquery ajax
[04:24:29] <Vivekananda> with lots of examples ?
[04:24:35] <rawrzors> hmmm.... I suppose thats an easy usage of jquery i've already learned
[04:24:36] <doug65536> rawrzors: you mean "real" submit, or ajax "submit"
[04:24:48] <Vivekananda> preferably a downloadable thing
[04:25:06] <Cork> Vivekananda: why would you need a book for json jquery ajax?
[04:25:18] <Cork> Vivekananda: it sounds very specific, for a full book
[04:25:24] <rawrzors> basically, I want input to be served to a SQL DB for tracking.
[04:25:34] <doug65536> rawrzors: you can css the width and height to 100%, or you can use $(window).width() and .height()
[04:26:08] <rawrzors> I think i should still learn the ins-n-outs of it. It's a nice resume item
[04:26:29] <doug65536> rawrzors: jquery is easy. do the first (free) lessons at codeschool.com
[04:26:44] <doug65536> at the end you'll feel like you know half of jquery already and learning will be fast from then on
[04:26:45] <rawrzors> I've been doing try.jquery.com
[04:27:07] <doug65536> the codeschool lessons are quite good. they're fun and you actually write code
[04:27:07] <rawrzors> their video/interactive tutorial
[04:27:24] <doug65536> you can test it right there and it helps you a bit if you screw up
[04:27:47] <rawrzors> the try.jquery ones have coding challenges with hints and whatnot
[04:27:52] <rawrzors> its rather good
[04:27:57] <doug65536> too easy IIRC
[04:28:06] <rawrzors> I just didn't want to learn jquery haha
[04:28:19] <doug65536> rawrzors: yes they are codeschool
[04:28:26] <doug65536> try.jquery.com == codeschool
[04:28:42] <rawrzors> one of those grrrrrrr, stupid function, grrrrrrrrrr, why am i doing this, ggrrrr,
[04:29:08] <doug65536> rawrzors: I was thinking of the try git "lessons". way too easy, gives you all the answers
[04:29:13] <Vivekananda> Cork: then what resource do you suggest I should use for this. I am trying to look for examples to learn things I dont know about these. I dont know enough right now to ask good question and learn further
[04:29:32] <Vivekananda> I do know the basics but a book would be good to read no ?
[04:29:39] <rawrzors> $("money") thats why :P
[04:30:32] <doug65536> rawrzors: you're young, you'll get hired. I have 25 yrs programming experience, everyone is afraid I'll want too much money
[04:31:03] <rawrzors> I'm 28 lol not THAT young
[04:31:32] <rawrzors> and im a girl... hard enough in this industry with all the neckbeards thinking you know nothing
[04:31:35] <doug65536> a bit older than I thought, but young enough :)
[04:32:04] <doug65536> rawrzors: programmers are completely cocky and arrogant. they think the men know nothing too :)
[04:32:26] <jop008> only my first button is rendred okay now
[04:32:31] <virgomoon> well, as a business owner, I can tell you that's one of my big fears, doug65536
[04:32:44] <jop008> for (var i=0;i<nlen;i++) { oel = $ ("#folder_" + i );  if (!isnull (oel)) {    oel.button().button ("refresh");
[04:32:53] <virgomoon> I don't outsource any of my coding for that reason .. just don't bother looking
[04:33:11] <Vivekananda> Cork: ? something ? .
[04:34:33] <jop008>  Cannot call method 'removeClass' of undefined  ??
[04:34:36] <doug65536> rawrzors: for what it's worth: I've never seen a bad female programmer
[04:34:36] <Vivekananda> I have a question too. why is it not a good idea to compare an object I obtain from html like --- $("#myDiv").html()  and one that I get from a .get function like var x = $.get(url)
[04:35:05] <rawrzors> doug65536 lol thats because we have to be good in order to rub it in dumb guys faces :P
[04:36:19] <virgomoon> I've found females, like any other area of life, are no different in their technical acumen or abilities, but they do tend to go about things drastically different than men, on average
[04:36:30] <xec_> rawrzors: i recommend you first learn javascript properly before diving into libraries like jquery. although the syntax looks like c, it's a completely different beast
[04:36:51] <rawrzors> the syntax, barely resembles c imo
[04:37:28] <virgomoon> oh, I don't know .. I'd say it's close enough to C to at least follow along with what's going on
[04:37:35] <doug65536> rawrzors: make sure you understand javascript closures. that part is completely different from c
[04:37:46] <doug65536> rawrzors: and variable scope
[04:38:05] <rawrzors> well thats why im doing the tutorial
[04:38:06] <rawrzors> lol
[04:38:19] <Vivekananda> which tutorial ?
[04:38:24] <rawrzors> try.jquery
[04:38:50] <doug65536> rawrzors: that tutorial focuses on jquery and barely scrapes the surface of javascript though
[04:39:00] <Vivekananda> doug65536: I did not know about closures either. Do they ( naively speaking ) refer to the same closure property that we study in maths
[04:39:03] <rawrzors> right, I only need jquery here though
[04:39:05] <Vivekananda> or a similar tihng ?
[04:39:24] <Vivekananda> doug65536: so what do you recommend as a good tutorial / reading material
[04:39:30] <Vivekananda> eloquent javascript ?
[04:40:06] <Vivekananda> rawrzors: are you good at C ?
[04:40:07] <doug65536> rawrzors: good luck with that. expect to spend a lot of time debugging frustrating, mysterious problems without a solid understanding of javascript fundamentals. javascript is fairly small and easy to learn though
[04:40:23] <Vivekananda> doug65536: ?
[04:40:59] <doug65536> Vivekananda: I'm responding to his statement that he doesn't need to learn javascript, just jquery
[04:41:19] <doug65536> rawrzors: you know jquery is just a library written in javascript right?
[04:41:20] <rawrzors> vivekananda, yea, good enough. I have a completely custom time header on my servers that have a sub 4k/ns sleep differential
[04:41:33] <rawrzors> using rdtsc averaging
[04:41:36] <rawrzors> ;)
[04:42:07] <netAction> Hi! Does anyone know how to fix a navigation bar in the header but not the header line itself? When fixing both bars it costs too much.
[04:42:27] <rawrzors> doug65536 of course i do
[04:43:12] <doug65536> Vivekananda: "closures" refer to the way that a function can "capture" access to variables in the current scope and be able to access them later - like in a callback
[04:43:48] <Vivekananda> aha okay. I was reminded of the property of closure in mathematical operations
[04:44:05] <Vivekananda> so a similar thing here if not the same
[04:44:17] <doug65536> Vivekananda: https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[04:44:45] <doug65536> Vivekananda: note how scroll_handler (which is called randomly at any time) can access variables in its parent scope at any time
[04:45:30] <doug65536> Vivekananda: long after the parent function has returned
[04:48:11] <rock2503> hi guys!
[04:48:17] <rock2503> list!
[04:48:28] <doug65536> Vivekananda: that code assigns the scroll_handler function to be called when the window scrolls - that function "captures" any variables in its parent and keeps them alive while scroll_handler is alive
[04:49:44] <murnieza> Hi. I have jQuery widget and there is ajax call. What do I have to pass to success option to trigger execution of SAME OBJECTS method on success?
[04:50:19] <Vivekananda> doug65536: by parent variables you mean the ones like section_pos .... section_pos_cache and the like right ?
[04:50:22] <murnieza> now it opens method as a anonymous function
[04:50:23] <doug65536> murnieza: can you show code snippet?
[04:50:25] <doug65536> Vivekananda: yes
[04:50:29] <Vivekananda> k
[04:50:33] <Vivekananda> got it
[04:50:50] <rock2503> !list
[04:50:53] <Vivekananda> although that raises another question for me ( another naive one sorry )
[04:51:38] <Vivekananda> correct me if I am wrong but when a C program runs frames are assigned to functions within the stack
[04:51:53] <doug65536> Vivekananda: yes, and after the function returns, those variables are gone
[04:51:56] <Vivekananda> and when one function is executed its frame gets deleted
[04:52:02] <Vivekananda> right ?
[04:52:05] <doug65536> Vivekananda: right
[04:52:18] <Vivekananda> great ! so in this case, somehow , the frame remains
[04:52:25] <murnieza> doug65536: http://pastebin.com/UZcGbAtm
[04:52:54] <doug65536> Vivekananda: yes, everything is an object and it's not a stack frame model. any variables lifetime can be extended indefinitely as long as someone is holding a reference to it
[04:53:49] <doug65536> murnieza: that looks like it would work. does it?
[04:54:14] <murnieza> oh, I've forgot to paste one more method
[04:54:38] <doug65536> Vivekananda: in javascript I mean (in last statement)
[04:54:44] <Vivekananda> doug65536: got it
[04:55:01] <murnieza> doug65536: http://pastebin.com/rrkaKE4a
[04:55:02] <Vivekananda> but I dont know enough js to understand your code complete ( still learning)
[04:55:05] <murnieza> edited pastebin
[04:55:23] <Vivekananda> so gimme a good reference and not just js but jquery and also examples for using
[04:55:35] <Vivekananda> json with ajax and js jquery
[04:55:43] <Vivekananda> if possible not php :(
[04:55:56] <murnieza> uhm?
[04:55:59] <Vivekananda> also another question
[04:56:07] <murnieza> this is request to local gile
[04:56:09] <murnieza> *file
[04:56:26] <Vivekananda> as above I already asked -- I have a question too. why is it not a good idea to compare an object I obtain from html like --- $("#myDiv").html()  and one that I get from a .get function like var x = $.get(url)
[04:56:36] <doug65536> murnieza: see line 8 and 13 - should force it to work: https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6148512
[04:56:55] <Scoding> Good day, could someone help me out? I have this code: http://pastie.org/8207985 however on itnernet explorer I still can't seem to redirect to the correct location, it just takes m to site.com/#
[04:58:42] <doug65536> murnieza: 'this' has funny semantics. when in doubt I capture it with a closure
[04:59:50] <murnieza> doug65536: are you shure you pasted correct link? :)
[05:00:03] <doug65536> murnieza: oops http://pastebin.com/qjumgd2D
[05:00:59] <doug65536> Vivekananda: did you manually compare them in the debugger to see what's different?
[05:02:31] <Vivekananda> doug65536: yes and just a few words were different and I can fix that but that is not what I wanted to ask. I was told , and read, that for different browsers, the html enclosed in the http response means different things ( am I correct ? )  hence even if I feed the same data
[05:03:27] <Vivekananda> to each browswer and then let them show up and THen do $("#myDiv").html() I might not get back the same thing as I would get from just the thing
[05:03:40] <Vivekananda> here is what I am trying to do for clarification sakes ---
[05:06:29] <doug65536> Vivekananda: what you could do is pass both of them through jquery with $(what_i_got_from_ajax).html() == $(what_i_got_from_html).html().
[05:07:03] <doug65536> Vivekananda: browser will "mangle" them both the same way, I'm guessing
[05:07:50] <Vivekananda> doug65536: everyone suggested I follow the more standard approach of getting info via json
[05:08:09] <Vivekananda> so I am trying to lear how to do it and also what to do for it
[05:08:27] <doug65536> Vivekananda: how to get json data? what language is server side? php?
[05:08:34] <Vivekananda> python
[05:08:48] <Vivekananda> doug65536: yes how to and also after gettting json what dod I do ?
[05:08:51] <Vivekananda> to compare ?
[05:08:52] <doug65536> Vivekananda: do you know how to produce json output from python side already?
[05:09:11] <Vivekananda> no :(
[05:09:39] <Vivekananda> I want to know and have a sample code too but I dont know jquery enough and so complicated functions are scary right now :)
[05:10:02] <doug65536> Vivekananda: if you call $("... some html here ...") then jquery will create a document fragment from it
[05:10:02] <Vivekananda> here is my help http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/jquery/
[05:11:08] <doug65536> Vivekananda: so I'm guessing that if you do $(the_ajax_html).html() == $(the_other_html).html() and the browser makes some subtle changes, then those changes will happen to both. make sense?
[05:11:36] <Vivekananda> doug65536: my aim is to do server polling to compare old data ( on the html) to new data ( via .get() or json) but people here told me that I should not compare those two
[05:11:42] <Vivekananda> I am trying to understand why
[05:12:12] <Vivekananda> doug65536: the thing is that even when both are the same I am not getting what I need
[05:12:21] <Vivekananda> right now another weird thing is happenning
[05:12:39] <Vivekananda> for some reason my file called myQuery.js is not being called altogether
[05:12:42] <Vivekananda> I wonder why
[05:12:55] <doug65536> Vivekananda: you have a javascript debugger right?
[05:13:00] <Vivekananda> it has just one function which is a docoument.ready ()
[05:13:10] <Vivekananda> yes but the stupid debugger does not show t
[05:13:13] <Vivekananda> the file itself
[05:13:21] <chokeamancer> I assume that is "document" not "docoument"
[05:13:22] <Vivekananda> as if it is not even there !!
[05:13:28] <Vivekananda> yes :)
[05:13:34] <chokeamancer> just checking ;-)
[05:13:48] <doug65536> Vivekananda: can you show relevant html/js on http://gist.github.com?
[05:14:34] <Vivekananda> doug65536: a while ago I was able to get results and here is the output http://pastebin.com/vXmKKKs5
[05:14:46] <Vivekananda> doug65536: sure
[05:15:08] <Vivekananda> the js are in app/static/ and the html in app/templates/
[05:15:20] <doug65536> Vivekananda: $(function() { ... code here ...});   is shorthand for document.ready function
[05:15:38] <Vivekananda> and the link is --- https://bitbucket.org/vvikramjhu/basant/src
[05:15:59] <Vivekananda> doug65536: I did not know that
[05:16:13] <Vivekananda> see! ! I need a good reference. Dont want to wallow
[05:17:02] <doug65536> Vivekananda: is that uploaded to a running website I can look at/debug?
[05:17:53] <Vivekananda> lol
[05:18:02] <Vivekananda> there you ask for the too much hahahah
[05:18:16] <Vivekananda> sorry I dont know how to do that yet for free so did not do it :)
[05:18:26] <Vivekananda> :(
[05:18:45] <Vivekananda> but I heard that I could do it on pythonfreeware or something
[05:19:01] <doug65536> Vivekananda: maybe not free. but web hosting is almost free nowadays
[05:21:02] <Vivekananda> doug65536: so what places do I go to for it
[05:21:19] <Vivekananda> also you have not yet given me a good place to systematically read jquery json ajax and js
[05:21:57] <doug65536> Vivekananda: try.jquery.com is good starting lessons for jquery
[05:22:48] <Vivekananda> hmmm okay
[05:22:59] <Vivekananda> although right now I need to find out how to use json
[05:23:02] <doug65536> Vivekananda: I've known js for many years so I can't think of any beginner resources
[05:23:23] <doug65536> Vivekananda: XMLHTTPRequest, if you don't want to use jquery. you do though right?
[05:24:17] <doug65536> Vivekananda: I'm having to make a lot of guesses as I look at your source. does it use basant.html or the other two things?
[05:26:04] <Vivekananda> doug65536: I will give you the gist in a sec
[05:26:13] <doug65536> Vivekananda: jquery is easy, first you need to load jquery in the head with a script tag... then you can use $.getJSON('...url...', function(data,status,xhr) { /* completion handler */ });
[05:26:54] <Vivekananda> doug65536: in that case could you tell me what is happenning in this --
[05:27:10] <doug65536> Vivekananda: or with parameters, use $.getJSON('...url...', { foo=2, bar=3 }, function(data,status,xhr) { /* completion handler */ });
[05:27:25] <Vivekananda> esp in the JSON sections http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/patterns/jquery/
[05:28:54] <doug65536> Vivekananda: what framework/library are you using on python side for http stuff?
[05:30:47] <doug65536> Vivekananda: you aren't "manually" doing raw CGI stuff from environment variables and stdin/stdout are you?
[05:31:36] <Vivekananda> doug65536: using flask on server
[05:31:43] <Vivekananda> doug65536: no :)
[05:31:50] <Vivekananda> I am not that good :)
[05:32:23] <doug65536> Vivekananda: here's how you produce a json response http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/api/#module-flask.json
[05:32:39] <Vivekananda> so here is what is happening. basantBase is the base page and has updated info of current orders ( from the back end db) that a restaurant got
[05:33:33] <Vivekananda> other two pages extend it. the basantOrder extends it to include a form to give the order ( for food) and the basant.html is simply showing orders by extending the base page
[05:33:50] <Vivekananda> doug65536: I alrady posted that and was asking you if you could tell me
[05:33:58] <Vivekananda> what the steps are doing
[05:34:51] <doug65536> Vivekananda: ok, say you had a customer database, with id, lastname, firstname. say you needed to lookup customer information by id...
[05:34:59] <doug65536> with json
[05:35:41] <doug65536> then you would make a "page" that takes a parameter like site.com/customerinfo?id=123
[05:36:02] <Vivekananda> doug65536: what I aam doing is like this
[05:36:08] <Vivekananda> I send new info to server
[05:36:28] <Vivekananda> server deposits it in db then I iterate over db and get all rows in a python dictionary
[05:36:42] <doug65536> that "page" would run python that looks it up in the db and makes a call like: jsonify(firstname=some_firstname_variable, lastname=some_lastname_variable)
[05:36:55] <doug65536> and sends the return value as the "page"
[05:37:33] <Vivekananda> then I do -- return render_template( "basantBase.html" , allinfo = allinfo)
[05:38:21] <doug65536> that way has it's benefits but it's the hard way
[05:38:25] <Vivekananda> right now it is pretty simple. I simply send the python dictionary and on the client too I iterate over the same dictionary !!! using python magic
[05:39:26] <doug65536> Vivekananda: ok, here's a way that might make a lot of sense to you: if you pass a dictionary to jsonify, it returns a text json response
[05:39:43] <doug65536> you send that back to the browser and you get a javascript object reconstructed perfectly in browser code
[05:40:02] <doug65536> the javascript object is the dictionary from python
[05:40:59] <doug65536> let me back up and show big picture for a moment, forget actual code...
[05:41:42] <doug65536> the javascript fetches a "page" using an ajax request, that page isn't html, instead it is json data. the javascript gets that and jquery decodes the json back into a javascript object for you
[05:42:18] <doug65536> so to produce that "page of json" you use jsonify - it takes a python dictionary and converts it into something you send to the browser
[05:42:22] <Vivekananda> let me read again what you said
[05:43:21] <Vivekananda> ok got it
[05:43:37] <Vivekananda> I understand what you are explaining but my question is
[05:43:59] <Vivekananda> WHY do I do this and WHAT is wrong with just comparing the things. Someone told me the reason here itself but I forgot
[05:44:12] <doug65536> so what those people are trying to tell you is, don't use templates and search and replace and all that in python, instead, provide a way to ask for json data from the server, and format that into a page with jquery
[05:44:14] <Vivekananda> could you tell me agian what the reason is to not compare
[05:44:47] <doug65536> I already gave you a solution. did you try it?
[05:45:13] <doug65536> forget that person. try what I suggested - I'm not trying to get you to start all over
[05:45:26] <sammich> do I want to know what's happening here?
[05:45:29] <doug65536> I'm describing what those people meant when they said use json
[05:46:48] <doug65536> Vivekananda: I gave you a way that should make it possible for you to reliably compare
[05:47:00] <doug65536> Vivekananda: want me to repeat it?
[05:48:17] <doug65536> Vivekananda: I think it will work, but I'm not sure. definitely worth a try though
[05:49:28] <sammich> is he trying to rebuild the whole page via a virtual page refresh instead of using AJAX to update the page?
[05:50:02] <doug65536> sammich: yes, he builds the page with a template on server side and needs to compare what's in page with what an ajax request gives, to detect a change
[05:50:12] <doug65536> I think
[05:50:26] <Vivekananda> no no I am reading it
[05:50:32] <sammich> sounds like Web 1.5 ;)
[05:50:46] <Vivekananda> trying to figure it out and for the life of I dont remember what the guys told me about using json
[05:50:48] <seutje> didn't adobe have a platform that worked like that?
[05:50:53] <doug65536> sammich: that's approximately correct. python on server side though :)
[05:51:17] <sammich> JSON is a data-encoding format
[05:51:32] <sammich> it's for data, not particularly well suited for documents
[05:51:52] <seutje> contribute, that's the one
[05:52:14] <seutje> used to be macromedia contribute
[05:53:13] <seutje> Vivekananda: thing is, if u ask the html string of an entire document, you will get the browser's interpretation, and this varies wildly between browsers
[05:53:43] <seutje> so if a FF user saves, he will have introduced changes compares to the one saved by the chrome user
[05:53:51] <seutje> even if he didn't change anything
[05:53:53] <doug65536> seutje: you can get the "browser's interpretation" for both using a document fragment, which is what I'm trying to get him to try
[05:53:59] <sammich> it's a game of chinese whispers, mmk?
[05:54:17] <seutje> it'll still depend on which browser saved the previous version
[05:54:26] <doug65536> same browser, it is same session
[05:54:46] <seutje> yeah, then u will be able to accurately get the diff
[05:54:53] <doug65536> it actually doesn't depend, I'm suggesting building a document fragment for both sides of the ==
[05:55:00] <seutje> but there's so many cases for false positives
[05:55:06] <seutje> oh
[05:55:11] <seutje> and do the comparison clientside?
[05:55:14] <doug65536> yes
[05:55:22] <seutje> guess that works if you can afford doing that
[05:55:26] <doug65536> I haven't tried it but I'd expect it to work
[05:55:27] <Vivekananda> seutje: yess that was the piont
[05:55:31] <Vivekananda> so tell me
[05:55:49] <sammich> sounds like taking a sledgehammer to a sewing needle
[05:56:02] <Vivekananda> suppose I followed doug65536 suggestion and got a json up and ready into my function and can iterate over the nodes etc
[05:56:03] <seutje> onload u save the whole shabang, and on submit you compare it?
[05:56:07] <Vivekananda> what do I do then ?
[05:56:17] <doug65536> Vivekananda: when did I say iterate over nodes?
[05:56:26] <Vivekananda> no no you did not
[05:56:28] <Vivekananda> and I wont
[05:56:32] <Vivekananda> so as I see it the other data I will get is from
[05:56:32] <seutje> why json? aren't u trying to compare the current state to the onload state?
[05:57:08] <sammich> why can't you just set a flag called 'isModified'
[05:57:09] <Vivekananda> seutje: yes I am trying to compare the current state to the db state after 5 seconds and load it freshly if db changed
[05:57:23] <Vivekananda> sammich: set it where ?
[05:57:25] <obert> doug65536: i get a php countfiles.php which returns filename.ext<br>anotherfilename.ext<br> would be ok? how to create the menu in js based on that?
[05:57:25] <seutje> oh
[05:57:26] <doug65536> Vivekananda: back up. we dropped the json idea right? you're sticking with the template and html
[05:57:31] <obert> .append?
[05:57:55] <Vivekananda> doug65536: no we did not drop it . I am trying to understand the merits and demerits of both ideas.
[05:58:12] <seutje> Vivekananda: so basically, u could just ajax load the exact same page and compare that
[05:58:18] <Vivekananda> and as for now , I already have set up ( stupidly) a 5 second refresh no matter what
[05:58:23] <seutje> just force cache bust
[05:58:26] <Vivekananda> so my thing is working but stupidly
[05:58:30] <doug65536> obert: you know how to retrieve it with $.get already?
[05:58:45] <obert> jquery's $.get?
[05:58:49] <doug65536> obert: yes
[05:58:54] <obert> no i assume, i will check the doc
[05:58:56] <Vivekananda> seutje: you mean do a get and post it at another temp.html ?
[05:59:07] <Vivekananda> then compare ? and then refresh my actual page ?
[05:59:11] <sammich> so, why can't we just hit refresh?
[05:59:19] <doug65536> obert: ok well, you can use the_data.split("<br>") to get an array of strings
[05:59:23] <seutje> no, just grab the same page again and compare it to the state you loaded originally
[05:59:32] <Guest____> hey all
[05:59:34] <Guest____> kind of off topic
[05:59:46] <Vivekananda> sammich this app is for a restaurant and new orders come in . All clients need to know when a new order came in hence the need for automatic refresh
[05:59:55] <sammich> websockets?
[05:59:56] <Guest____> but what kind of career ladder is there in front end development
[05:59:58] <doug65536> obert: then generate an unordered list with var menu = $("<ul>").attr("class","my_menu_class")
[06:00:08] <Guest____> like i understand junior and senior level
[06:00:13] <Guest____> but what is there after that
[06:00:22] <seutje> super senoir
[06:00:25] <sammich> then you go and startup Google 2.0
[06:00:26] <doug65536> obert: then menu.append the $("<li>").append(the_filename)
[06:00:27] <seutje> senior even
[06:00:29] <doug65536> obert: etc
[06:00:30] <sammich> and make real money
[06:00:34] <seutje> then you merge with trunks
[06:00:47] <sammich> and then you make pardner
[06:00:55] <Guest____> I'm seriously though
[06:00:55] <sammich> put er thar
[06:01:02] <obert> uff i will try. atm my jquery is very minimal using .load
[06:01:02] <Guest____> serious*
[06:01:13] <Guest____> appreciate the humor
[06:01:15] <seutje> you think I was joking with the dbz reference?
[06:01:25] <seutje> but nah, I dunno
[06:01:28] <Guest____> super senior?
[06:01:34] <seutje> usually ppl go freelance before making super senior
[06:01:35] <sammich> my DBZ knowledge is minimal
[06:01:42] <Guest____> hah
[06:01:49] <seutje> cause being an employee in this business is pretty shit
[06:02:09] <sammich> I'm coming up to my first pay review in 2 months time
[06:02:22] <obert> thanks for now doug65536
[06:02:38] <Vivekananda> seutje: how do I grab the same page again
[06:02:44] <Vivekananda> using .get () ? right ?
[06:03:02] <seutje> Guest____: most ppl I know start freelance on the side and move to it full-time once they have too much work they get to pick & choose
[06:03:27] <seutje> Vivekananda: whichever works for you, I'm not a big fan of the convenience methods
[06:03:31] <doug65536> good luck with freelance
[06:03:40] <doug65536> too many companies giving it away
[06:04:21] <seutje> iono, they all only complain of too much jobs
[06:04:21] <doug65536> you can get some starving 3rd world sucker to make a website for $10 on freelance.com
[06:04:33] <Guest____> i know
[06:04:45] <Guest____> lance and freelance.com kind of ruin it for a lot of us.
[06:04:49] <Guest____> elance*
[06:05:07] <obert> hmm and having a .click event to show the $.ajax things from a link, how to re-close that $.ajax by .click on the link again?
[06:05:10] <ML74> Anyone got any experience of uniformjs? How can I trigger an event on selection of a checkbox?
[06:05:11] <Guest____> i just wanna get up to the 100k a year
[06:05:45] <obert> like .clickagain ;)
[06:06:09] <Vivekananda> seutje: but what would you have preferred ?
[06:06:20] <Whirl3d> ML74, you can listen for the click event on the check box then do whatever you want from there
[06:06:23] <Vivekananda> also isnt just getting the page the convenient method ?
[06:06:27] <seutje> obert: store the return from $.ajax and call .abort() on it
[06:06:54] <seutje> like if (this.jqXHR) { this.jqXHR.abort(); } this.jqXHR = $.ajax({...});
[06:06:58] <obert> O_o i am really a newbie in js seems
[06:07:29] <seutje> assuming "this" is an instance
[06:07:29] <ML74> Whirl3d: It's not fired though, which is weird.
[06:07:39] <seutje> Vivekananda: just regular old $.ajax()?
[06:08:15] <Whirl3d> so you are able to click the checkbox to change it's state, but a click handler on it doesn't fire?
[06:08:25] <Vivekananda> seutje: but I am confused now. Was I not doing .get() ~ .ajax () when trying to compare? I thought you meant that I should use json or something similar for it
[06:08:42] <Vivekananda> btw a different question. how does one keep a back of a running app ?
[06:08:46] <Vivekananda> on a server ?
[06:09:58] <ML74> Whirl3d: Yeah
[06:09:59] <WG1337> Hi! I have a script that opens url in background (with jquery). But IE8 fails, because url is something like: http://domain.com?name=aāāššēē. How could I convert those chars so IE8 won't fail?
[06:10:06] <obert> seutje: like http://pastebin.com/a7K0gPav ?
[06:10:24] <obert> seems not
[06:10:39] <seutje> ML74: according to uniform docs, you have to call $.uniform.update(elementReference);
[06:10:58] <seutje> where elementReference is a reference to the DOM element you wish to update
[06:11:05] <seutje> (e.g. the actual checkbox)
[06:11:24] <ML74> seujte: But when do I call that if I can't trigger it? :/
[06:11:42] <ML74> seutje:  ^^
[06:12:07] <seutje> ML74: oh I'm sorry, I must have misunderstood, I thought u wanted to update a uniform representation of a checkbox you programmatically changed
[06:12:30] <seutje> obert: erm, no :x
[06:12:41] <obert> hehe
[06:12:52] <obert> noticed
[06:13:03] <ML74> Whirl3d: Here's how the markup looks… https://gist.github.com/anonymous/d99083146d295f4430f9
[06:13:15] <seutje> obert: I'm not sure if the convenience methods also return a jqXHR object, but you are storing the return value of the click method, instead of the ajax one
[06:13:47] <ML74> Whirl3d: Ideally, I need a trigger when the span has the class checked added to it :/
[06:13:48] <seutje> also, in this example, "this" seems to reference the window object
[06:14:49] <obert> dunno. atm the code works from $('pages till the end
[06:15:05] <obert> i click and it shows the content of inc/*.html
[06:15:12] <seutje> obert: http://pastebin.com/ttirJnCk
[06:15:53] <seutje> obert: I scoped the runningXHR variable to that document.rdy function, so it won't leak outside, but will persist over multiple clicks
[06:16:19] <seutje> obert: I moved the check to within the click handler, cause we want to check & abort on every click, not just once when we are binding the click
[06:16:54] <seutje> obert: I assign the return value of $().load() to the runningXHR variable (not sure if that actually works, like I said, I never use the convenience methods)
[06:17:02] <seutje> ?source load
[06:18:18] <seutje> obert: yeah, load seems to return the collection it was called on instead of the jqXHR object
[06:18:22] <seutje> so that won't work
[06:19:00] <obert> seutje: no luck
[06:19:14] <seutje> obert: yeah, u'll have to convert it to a $.ajax() call
[06:19:17] <doug65536> seutje: obert the jqXHR is the third parameter to the callback
[06:19:33] <obert> uhmf
[06:19:39] <seutje> doug65536: erm, what?
[06:20:09] <doug65536> seutje: oh nevermind, didn't see context
[06:20:11] <seutje> not sure how that allows us to store a reference to it before the ajax call ends
[06:20:15] <seutje> yeah :P
[06:20:27] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do?
[06:20:58] <obert> things are going complex, maybe it is better to wait before add the .click_ed_ event
[06:21:19] <obert> thanks for now
[06:21:20] <doug65536> obert: waiting is probably much more complex
[06:21:29] <obert> :p
[06:21:46] <doug65536> :)
[06:22:01] <Vivekananda> doug65536: you gone ?
[06:22:06] <doug65536> Vivekananda: no
[06:22:12] <ravenzz> do you want to abort the req?
[06:22:14] <doug65536> Vivekananda: I was gone, Im back
[06:22:18] <Vivekananda> may I add you on xchat and ping you again
[06:22:32] <doug65536> yeah ok
[06:23:12] <seutje> obert: something like this: http://pastebin.com/TfcBMMy9
[06:23:35] <ravenzz> you should check the request status
[06:23:48] <seutje> good point
[06:23:49] <doug65536> WG1337: there is an internationalized domain name specification
[06:23:59] <doug65536> WG1337: my guess is convert it yourself?
[06:24:07] <ravenzz> if it is 1 (open but not competed) you abort
[06:24:14] <doug65536> WG1337: might be a huge pain, haven't tried that
[06:25:23] <doug65536> WG1337: can you show code snippet?
[06:25:34] <ravenzz> req && req.readyState === 1 && req.abort()
[06:25:45] <obert> seutje: not really
[06:25:54] <seutje> obert: hm?
[06:26:04] <doug65536> WG1337: does encodeURI help?
[06:26:12] <obert> seutje: if i click it shows up the content, re-click the same link doesnt close it
[06:26:27] <seutje> erm...
[06:26:41] <doug65536> WG1337: sorry, just realized it is the path that is internationalized, not the domain
[06:26:42] <seutje> my sense of smell was not able to pick up on this undisclosed requirement
[06:27:09] <obert> seutje: ? you meant you misunderstood my question? :)
[06:27:55] <doug65536> WG1337: or escape function
[06:28:22] <seutje> obert: you said u wanted to "re-close $.ajax"
[06:29:09] <obert> seutje: click a link, show the content of the file, click again on the link and close the content
[06:29:13] <WG1337> doug65536: how about if I remake the script to do POST instead of GET? Will IE8 fail too? (IE8 fails because there are UTF8 chars in URL)
[06:29:15] <obert> like show/hide
[06:29:29] <obert> seutje: sorry i am not getting what your code does heh
[06:29:33] <seutje> obert: http://pastebin.com/1bZ12Hkq
[06:29:34] <seutje> there
[06:29:39] <doug65536> WG1337: that might help
[06:29:57] <obert> seutje: what you meant with re-close $.ajax then
[06:30:01] <WG1337> doug65536: Ok, thanks, will try that out
[06:30:17] <seutje> obert: lol, forgot the actual close thing http://pastebin.com/1Hhx4qhz
[06:30:39] <doug65536> WG1337: those utf8 chars are after the ? - I can't find your example in scrollback
[06:30:43] <seutje> obert: I thought u wanted to kill any running ajax request when clicking the button again
[06:31:07] <seutje> obert: it's used a lot for autocompletes where the user might type another character while you're already doing a request to get the results of what they had typed before
[06:31:16] <ravenzz> obert he meant abort the previous ajax request if you click again the button
[06:31:19] <seutje> obert: then u want to kill that running request and initiate a new one
[06:31:29] <seutje> otherwise the handler will fire when it comes back
[06:31:36] <seutje> but then another request is already on its way
[06:31:38] <doug65536> WG1337: ok found it. yeah post might be a workaround
[06:31:56] <seutje> causing the success handler to be fired twice, in quick succession, with different results
[06:32:05] <seutje> often undesirable
[06:32:06] <obert> ah
[06:32:34] <obert> better to save every code. (it doesnt hide the content by click again the link :P)
[06:32:43] <obert> but i will check it again
[06:32:51] <seutje> the last one I pasted? http://pastebin.com/1Hhx4qhz
[06:32:51] <obert> thanks for now
[06:33:10] <obert> ah no, didnt see it
[06:33:38] <doug65536> seutje: obert doesn't else have to put done back to false?
[06:34:09] <seutje> iono, we're done, don't get any donner :P
[06:34:46] <seutje> obert: does it need to open up again after clicking it some more?
[06:35:10] <ravenzz> obert what you should do is: on click load the content through ajax (with some logic to prevent multiple request when the user clicks repeteadly on the link). When the ajax req returns with success, you remove that logic and add a simple toggle() functionality
[06:35:50] <seutje> if so: http://pastebin.com/QTzbfSKa
[06:36:03] <obert> seutje: sure
[06:36:28] <doug65536> seutje: obert even better
[06:36:31] <obert> maybe it is useless to close it on the second time but better to try it ,)
[06:36:38] <seutje> guess I should set done in the load() callback
[06:36:50] <seutje> instead of right after initiating the request
[06:37:22] <doug65536> seutje: then you better .show() it there too, in case of early .toggle()
[06:37:33] <seutje> perhaps
[06:37:45] <seutje> I'm usually a bit iffy about using toggle in production code
[06:38:06] <seutje> rather check myself and show or hide accordingly
[06:38:24] <seutje> using a class, of course :P
[06:38:25] <doug65536> seutje: is that superstition or are there real problems with toggle?
[06:38:43] <obert> weird, seems to work now but i see a <body style> added after the first click
[06:38:53] <seutje> doug65536: had problems in the past when you spam it
[06:39:14] <seutje> but partly superstition
[06:39:21] <obert> no, after i get .toggle
[06:39:25] <seutje> same reason I don't use .load()
[06:39:34] <seutje> too much magic in 1 method
[06:40:00] <seutje> obert: is #content the body?
[06:40:07] <obert> maybe it is related to style="display: block/none" added by the event
[06:40:15] <sammich> $.magic
[06:40:42] <obert> it is <body><ul id="pages">..</ul><div id="content">stuff took from inc/*.html</div></body>
[06:40:47] <seutje> obert: yeah, that's why I'm asking if the $('#content') element is the body
[06:40:50] <seutje> oh... odd
[06:41:15] <obert> you seems to know what you're doing though
[06:41:41] <seutje> it might force a layout style on the parent whilst doing the hiding/showing, in case there's a duration specified
[06:42:06] <seutje> this is why I prefer to do my hiding/showing with regular old html classes
[06:42:13] <seutje> (even if that's less performant on some browsers_
[06:42:55] <obert> old html classes?
[06:42:56] <doug65536> seutje: yeah I see how it could get ugly with lots of async .load running when spamming it
[06:43:26] <seutje> obert: yeah, u know... $('#content').addClass('hidden')
[06:43:28] <doug65536> seutje: need a 1-shot there to only let 1 load start
[06:47:24] <obert> uhmf
[06:47:56] <doug65536> seutje: obert  this should be spam-proof
[06:47:58] <doug65536> http://pastebin.com/8jcN0gjs
[06:48:10] <obert> seutje: instead .toggle you meant and use .hidden { display: none; }
[06:50:25] <obert> using addClass seems to have <body style> still there
[06:50:28] <obert> mah
[06:51:41] <obert> not much difference between those two examples
[06:52:32] <doug65536> obert: mine won't allow a bunch of redundant overlapping loads to happen
[06:52:44] <doug65536> if user clicks it quickly or has slow connection
[06:53:12] <obert> mhm maybe it is just about css now
[06:53:53] <doug65536> obert: if you don't want to hear what I have to say, just say it
[06:54:20] <doug65536> obert: I've got better things to do than try to force my help on some random person
[06:55:08] <obert> yup solved
[06:55:33] <obert> doug65536: i read and save everything :p
[06:56:27] <obert> looks cool now
[06:57:42] <obert> doug65536: and yes, i am using your code
[06:58:47] <doug65536> obert: ok, it's mostly seutje's code, I just touched it up :)
[06:59:03] <obert> well that code
[07:01:57] <obert> doug65536: seutje: +1
[07:02:07] <obert> s/:/,
[07:03:35] <obert> thanks to all
[07:03:45] <seutje> and all to thanks!
[07:05:36] <obert> hmm issues still
[07:05:59] <doug65536> obert: is there a link I can go to to see it on an actual page?
[07:06:12] <obert> no but i can setup it
[07:06:32] <obert> the first link works but the second doesnt shows up the content
[07:06:33] <obert> meh
[07:07:08] <doug65536> I have a better way to implement that code snippet, 1 sec
[07:07:25] <obert> wait i will setup a testcase :p
[07:07:57] <doug65536> obert: might make no difference but should be safer http://pastebin.com/DWCTc04D
[07:08:55] <doug65536> obert: microscopically more efficient http://pastebin.com/uMDq7zFF
[07:10:17] <Ice_Strike> When I do: $('#LinesContainer').append($('#templatePlan').html());
[07:10:41] <Ice_Strike> I want to modify one of the element value when it has been appended.
[07:10:45] <Ice_Strike> How is that can be done?
[07:12:06] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: var newplan = $('#templatePlan').html(); $('#LinesContainer').append(newplan)...change stuff here...
[07:12:09] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: change what
[07:12:28] <Ice_Strike> doug65536 Change the value of Input field.
[07:12:41] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: there's only one in there?
[07:13:05] <Ice_Strike> Well if I appended 3 times - there will be 3 inputs field ofcourse.
[07:13:06] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: var newplan = $('#templatePlan').html(); $('#LinesContainer').append(newplan).next('input').val(...new value...);
[07:13:31] <Ice_Strike> Hmm
[07:13:42] <Ice_Strike> Let me pastebin, 1 sec
[07:14:20] <miguel_> hi
[07:17:23] <obert> doug65536: http://ramacciotti.altervista.org/testcases/
[07:18:14] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: var newplan = $('#templatePlan').html(); $('#LinesContainer').append(newplan).next('input').val(...value1...).end().append(newplan).next('input').val(...value2...).end()... etc;
[07:18:20] <Guest22507> i have a question.  (Draggable containment)  When I use an array, x1,y1 is left and top. x2,y2  width and height, But it use the top left corner of the draggable, it dosent recognize the width and height of the draggable
[07:19:58] <doug65536> obert: aha, so each button needs its own state... 1 sec
[07:20:14] <doug65536> obert: 2nd link should show something different, right?
[07:20:54] <obert> doug65536: try to refresh and click on the second link ;)
[07:20:56] <kevin_> That it ! pulled enough hair out - time to ask the experts!
[07:21:05] <obert> yep one logo test and one form test
[07:21:07] <kevin_> All experts - stuck with a $.load problem not rendering script tags - anyone know a workround
[07:21:54] <kevin_> loading twitter / google / facebook dynamically that all contain a <script> tag
[07:24:51] <Ice_Strike> doug65536 http://pastebin.com/0kTgtYCV
[07:27:26] <doug65536> obert: this should do it http://pastebin.com/jBYpxNxN
[07:27:44] <doug65536> obert: oops bug 1 sec
[07:27:55] <obert> hehe
[07:28:05] <doug65536> obert: ok http://pastebin.com/iJPu8hug
[07:28:14] <obert> why $(function) instead doc ready?
[07:28:26] <doug65536> obert: that is doc ready
[07:28:55] <doug65536> $(function() { ... })    <- shorthand for $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[07:29:37] <doug65536> obert: document ready handler is so common, jquery has a short form of specifying it
[07:30:09] <obert> doug65536: no luck seems
[07:30:24] <doug65536> obert: sec, let me debug
[07:31:22] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: do you have a class or a data attribute that lets you identify which input field is category?
[07:31:59] <leron> hi
[07:32:28] <obert> doug65536: no error in console seems
[07:33:20] <Ice_Strike> doug65536 Yes look at the code
[07:33:48] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: id is no good from what I can see... you have duplicate ids? or am I missing something
[07:33:58] <obert> alert(data) is not showing up too
[07:34:26] <Ice_Strike> this is not a duplicate id
[07:34:35] <doug65536> obert: oh, I see the problem
[07:34:41] <Ice_Strike> firstly select a category and then click on Add button to append
[07:35:20] <kevin_> Anyone able to help with jquery $.load problem ????
[07:35:49] <doug65536> obert: http://pastebin.com/RnKi4XEW
[07:36:54] <doug65536> obert: it should allow it to immediately start a new download and ignore late results if user spams through them - which is why it is significantly larger code
[07:37:37] <obert> doug65536: it works so-so :)
[07:37:39] <doug65536> obert: wait found bug
[07:37:55] <obert> that click again event doesnt close it
[07:37:57] <doug65536> pastebin kind of sucks by the way :)
[07:38:03] <obert> which is useless at a point
[07:38:25] <doug65536> basically notepad
[07:38:37] <obert> since you just navigate throught the tests you dont need to close one, just click on another
[07:42:09] <doug65536> obert: this should work better https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6156417
[07:43:27] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: ok I see...
[07:43:49] <obert> doug65536: no sorry
[07:44:30] <obert> doug65536: unexpected }
[07:44:51] <obert> line 25 else
[07:44:53] <doug65536> obert:  put { after else
[07:45:35] <obert> seems ok
[07:45:46] <obert> doug65536: hehe i know the basic syntax at least:P
[07:45:48] <doug65536> obert: spam it, it should be bulletproof
[07:46:08] <obert> doug65536: i wrote a little python too :p
[07:46:28] <obert> http://ramacciotti.altervista.org/testcases/ same url
[07:46:30] <doug65536> obert: I added a bunch of logic to make it never screw up if user spam clicks all over the links
[07:46:55] <obert> yep i see the amount of code, dunno the logic though
[07:47:20] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: ok you can store the result of the append...
[07:47:23] <obert> this looks good isnt it?
[07:48:01] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: then use next, with a css selector with an attribute filter...
[07:48:09] <doug65536> obert: yep, seems perfect
[07:48:21] <obert> doug65536: many thanks
[07:48:25] <doug65536> obert: np
[07:49:00] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: let me attempt...
[07:49:05] <Ice_Strike> Ok
[07:49:11] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: is there an actual site I can try it at?
[07:50:26] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: if I can try on live site, I can do experimental javascript to make sure I am making selector correctly etc
[07:50:49] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: wait, I'll just make a fiddle...
[07:54:14] <tada> hello everyone
[07:54:33] <tada> i have a question about jquery tag-it plugin
[07:54:41] <tada> is there anyone who can help me?
[07:55:09] <BillCriswell> tada: Just ask. If someone can help they most likely will.
[07:55:17] <tada> i c
[07:55:58] <ph88> how can i do this ?  http://pastebin.com/Gpeiy6Zi
[07:56:52] <tada> when choosing an existing tag (autocomplete) but not finish typing...it leaves behing the text
[07:57:55] <tada> http://aehlke.github.io/tag-it/examples.html - in Single Input Field (2)
[07:57:55] <yuka> hi
[07:58:21] <yuka> http://pastebin.com/uSnmryTP <- I have this code, and in IE9 it producec : Unable to get value of the property 'getContext': object is null or undefined
[07:58:25] <tada> if you type sca and click somewhere on the page...it does not add tag but leaves behing the text
[07:58:26] <yuka> anybody can help me solve this?
[07:58:32] <tada> is there to fix this?
[08:02:35] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: http://jsfiddle.net/gy6G6/10/
[08:03:40] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: removed hack http://jsfiddle.net/gy6G6/11/
[08:03:53] <tada> anyone?
[08:04:18] <grafi> tada works for me
[08:04:56] <BillCriswell> I can only get it to work when I refocus after canceling out the autocomplete thing.
[08:05:04] <doug65536> tada: how do I get bug to happen
[08:05:24] <grafi> hm let me try typing something that will give me autocomplete
[08:05:37] <BillCriswell> doug65536: http://aehlke.github.io/tag-it/examples.html in the Single Input Field (2) section
[08:05:52] <grafi> yeah BillCriswell you're right
[08:05:53] <doug65536> BillCriswell: ok, what do I type t make it autocomplete something
[08:05:58] <BillCriswell> sca
[08:06:00] <grafi> sca @ doug65536
[08:06:06] <BillCriswell> or java or something
[08:06:12] <grafi> or a something
[08:06:13] <grafi> :P
[08:06:13] <BillCriswell> htink it's just a list of programming languages
[08:06:24] <grafi> then why is java in there :x
[08:07:09] <doug65536> BillCriswell: works for me. you'll have to be exact about what you do in ui to make it happen
[08:07:18] <doug65536> a<space> works, sca<space> works
[08:07:34] <BillCriswell> doug65536: I was explaing it for soemone else. It's when you try to click outside of the input or autocomplete
[08:08:19] <BillCriswell> Type "java" then click anywhere besides the input or autocomplete \.
[08:08:19] <doug65536> BillCriswell: define "solve this". what do you want it to do if they click outside it
[08:08:31] <doug65536> BillCriswell: add it?
[08:08:31] <BillCriswell> he wants it to auto complete.
[08:08:34] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[08:08:39] <BillCriswell> Well, "tag" it
[08:08:48] <grafi> hm
[08:08:48] <doug65536> do what space would do
[08:09:02] <doug65536> got it
[08:09:32] <grafi> certainly an edge case
[08:09:33] <grafi> :P
[08:09:41] <BillCriswell> Haha, definitely.
[08:09:49] <BillCriswell> Seemed like a fun one to get though.
[08:10:26] <doug65536> BillCriswell: seems like intended behavior
[08:10:43] <doug65536> BillCriswell: but I see your point of view too
[08:10:52] <tada> grafi: it does not create the tag
[08:11:00] <tada> just have text
[08:11:08] <grafi> yeah i saw that
[08:11:13] <doug65536> wait, tada is person asking
[08:11:14] <doug65536> ?
[08:11:23] <grafi> doug65536 you seem confused :D
[08:11:33] <BillCriswell> doug65536: Yes. I wasn't saying "he" talking about myself. =p
[08:11:48] <tada> i asked abt tag-it if there is a confusion
[08:11:58] <doug65536> BillCriswell: "he" didn't seem to narrow it down a lot :)
[08:12:29] <tada> grafi: but wherever submit button it, is clear it off
[08:12:49] <tada> i need to do same when there is no submit button ? any idea what's wrong?
[08:12:53] <BillCriswell> doug65536: I disagree about it seeming like the right behavior. I can't exit any other field on that page without it turning the last thing I typed into a tag.
[08:13:22] <grafi> tada what do you want? should the text just disappear?
[08:13:45] <doug65536> BillCriswell: I can
[08:13:47] <tada> grafi: yes as the tag was not created by hitting enter...it should get removed
[08:14:19] <BillCriswell> doug65536: Which one besides the one we're having the issue with?
[08:14:24] <doug65536> BillCriswell: all
[08:14:38] <doug65536> click each one, press 'a' then click outside the field, in each one
[08:14:47] <slax0r> Hi, I'm using AJAX to load some parts of the page, and in this ajax loaded page, there is a script tag with jquery, when ajax fires, somehow this jquery gets executed 2 times, as well, the script is loaded 2 times, but if I open the url of that page, there is only one script, and ajax fires only one time as well
[08:14:55] <BillCriswell> It turns them all into a tags here in Chrome.
[08:15:00] <slax0r> so how can then this script be loaded two times when using jquery ajax?
[08:15:03] <doug65536> I'm in chrome
[08:15:42] <BillCriswell> So you're saying if you type an "a" in the field and click away from the field it doesn't give it a blue background with rounded corners?
[08:15:55] <BillCriswell> It's just plain text left there in the input?
[08:16:35] <doug65536> http://www.pasteall.org/pic/56891
[08:16:58] <doug65536> BillCriswell: yes
[08:17:07] <doug65536> BillCriswell: see screenshot
[08:17:16] <BillCriswell> I can't replicate that at all
[08:17:35] <tada> grafi: any ideas
[08:17:40] <doug65536> no weird addons on my system
[08:17:46] <slax0r> nvm, I'm blind
[08:19:06] <BillCriswell> Thinking he should just use another plugin lol.
[08:19:31] <doug65536> tada: what does singleFieldNode option do?
[08:19:45] <BillCriswell> doug65536: Ahhhh, I can replicate it if I click another INPUT, but anywhere else it automatically turns it into a tag.
[08:20:38] <tada> doug65536: it  is just a single input form with comma seprated list
[08:20:45] <tada> so do not do anything different
[08:20:47] <doug65536> BillCriswell: now it's suddenly working well for me lol
[08:20:55] <BillCriswell> o
[08:21:15] <BillCriswell> Didn't mean to type that lol
[08:21:21] <BillCriswell> i'm tired
[08:21:26] <Ice_Strike> doug65536 thank you!
[08:21:32] <doug65536> Ice_Strike: np
[08:21:48] <tada> doug65536: any idead what to do for that?
[08:21:52] <tada> *idea
[08:22:25] <doug65536> tada: what I want to tell you is to call something to tell the plugin to add the tag I'm entering, but I don't see it yet
[08:22:40] <doug65536> tada: then wire up a blur handler to call that
[08:23:17] <tada> dough65536: something surely clears it up on click of submit button in other examples
[08:23:26] <tada> i could not trace that
[08:23:46] <doug65536> tada:  yes I see what it does, but it looks like it's internal call... let me look more
[08:24:01] <tada> dough65536: sure
[08:30:23] <doug65536> tada: I think have a solution, but it's not very pretty...
[08:31:13] <tada> dough65536: if it works it is can me made clean
[08:31:29] <tada> dough65536: jsfiddle?
[08:32:12] <doug65536> $(document.activeElement).trigger('keypress', $.ui.keyCode.TAB, ... stuff...   to inject TAB into field on blur
[08:32:22] <Changa> Hello : I am trying to submit a form using ajaxSubmit, firebug tells me that the post works but I cannot access the post variables on the php page. The code is here if it helps: http://jsfiddle.net/kct22/
[08:33:22] <Changa> I can give password access if you want to have a closer look
[08:33:25] <d0den> How can I stop jquery mobile from adding the classes ui-mobile-viewport and ui-overlay-c to the <body> tag of my page?
[08:33:30] <tada> doug65536: not sure if i understood it
[08:34:04] <tada> dough65536: not a expert in javascript or jquery , could elaborate
[08:34:26] <doug65536> tada: ok, first you'd need to setup a blur callback which is called when users leave the field...
[08:35:18] <doug65536> tada: then you can do this.trigger(... the stuff above) to send a TAB event, forcing it to add whatever tag you have half entered
[08:36:01] <doug65536> tada: I realize that is a bit vague...
[08:36:07] <tada> dough65536: would you be able to give me a jsfiddle
[08:36:19] <doug65536> reconstruct all that stuff?
[08:36:27] <tada> dough65536i can give you for a tag page
[08:36:42] <tada> dough65536 : for a page with tagit
[08:37:07] <doug65536> tada: you'll make me a fiddle with a tag you mean? sure. let me grab a coffee
[08:37:25] <tada> dough65536 : yes i would do so
[08:37:48] <doug65536> two tags please, so I can try to reproduce bug
[08:37:54] <doug65536> two input fields I mean
[08:38:21] <raj> why is it important to know the timezone of a user?
[08:41:06] <d0den> I'm trying to style jquery-mobile and I've having terrible trouble getting divs to reach the bottom of the page on scroll when the viewport is smaller than the content. Could anyone take a quick look? http://mob.orderedwords.com/
[08:43:38] <Mrgoose> is there a way to not have a web app refresh everytime you open it ?
[08:44:27] <doug65536> Mrgoose: specify cache expires header in the future
[08:44:33] <doug65536> http header
[08:44:37] <d0den> The <body> tag doesn't extend to the bottom of the page when the viewport is small. I don't understand how that's possible
[08:44:57] <tada> dough65536 :http://jsfiddle.net/andrewboltachev/28WcG/
[08:45:10] <tada> dough65336 here is something that works
[08:45:12] <Mrgoose> doug65536, you recommedn that method over using manfiest cache?
[08:47:30] <doug65536> tada: I'm having trouble getting it to misbehave
[08:48:11] <doug65536> Mrgoose: well, you require it to work with pre-html5 browsers?
[08:48:30] <Mrgoose> doug65536, no
[08:48:43] <tada> dough65536 :since the  available tags are this , that and label1
[08:49:00] <tada> dough65536: you need to type that or update that list
[08:49:03] <doug65536> Mrgoose: well, manifest cache is new to me so if you say so :)
[08:49:30] <doug65536> Mrgoose: I've read a bit about it, never used it
[08:49:43] <doug65536> Mrgoose: in a slightly different context, localstorage
[08:50:48] <doug65536> tada: oh, get autocomplete dropdown to appear first, right?
[08:51:20] <doug65536> tada: weird, it is very intermittent
[08:51:54] <tada> dough65536: dont worry abt dropdown...this displays it as list
[08:52:43] <doug65536> tada: I can't get it to happen reliably
[08:52:50] <doug65536> tada: bug I mean
[08:53:22] <tada> dough65536: hmm, do u have any suggestion
[08:53:41] <doug65536> tada: wow, it gets worse. I can't delete first tag in second field
[08:54:01] <tada> dough65536 : just type l in the input and click somewhere on page...it remains there
[08:54:03] <doug65536> http://jsfiddle.net/28WcG/2/
[08:54:25] <doug65536> tada: actually, it doesn't
[08:54:46] <doug65536> tada: which explains why BillCriswell and other person didn't see the problem
[08:54:50] <Changa> Hello : I am trying to submit a form using ajaxSubmit, firebug tells me that the post works but I cannot access the post variables on the php page. The code is here if it helps: http://jsfiddle.net/kct22/
[08:55:30] <tada> dough65536: but you saw in the documentation page tag-it provided
[08:55:53] <doug65536> tada: yes, and I can barely get it to happen on fiddle, but I have got it to happen a couple of times
[08:56:08] <doug65536> tada: I need to be able to reliably make bug happen to be sure I'm fixing it
[08:56:41] <tada> dough65536: hmm, not sure as the code i am using surely had it ...that is why asked here
[08:56:44] <d0den> I'm using jquery-mobile, but the only part of it I actually need are the sliders. Is there an easy way to stop jquery-mobile from interfering with the rest of the page? I tried using the custom build tool, but couldn't get it to work
[08:59:18] <doug65536> Changa: hmm, is there more than one form?
[08:59:27] <Changa> yes
[08:59:32] <doug65536> Changa: I want to try to initialize the form but I can't get an id
[08:59:33] <Changa> but I don't see why its doing this
[08:59:59] <Changa> PM doug65536
[09:00:09] <doug65536> Changa: the documentation says to do $("#form").ajaxForm(function() { });
[09:00:14] <doug65536> Changa: not sure if that matters
[09:00:30] <doug65536> Changa: but in js, I can't get id since it is unpredictable
[09:00:38] <doug65536> Changa: unless script is in html file
[09:00:49] <doug65536> Changa: id is unpredictable
[09:00:53] <Changa> id is dynamically generated
[09:00:56] <Changa> using php
[09:01:19] <aksu> how can i check if div element is clicked in javascript
[09:02:05] <tada> doug65536: did u say others did nto have this prblm?
[09:02:47] <doug65536> tada: they mostly didn't then they did... it seems random
[09:03:08] <Space_> does this syntax seem correct? if($('#promo').hasClass('open')){ ...}
[09:03:12] <doug65536> tada: maybe there is an updated version of the plugin?
[09:03:20] <doug65536> Space_: yes
[09:03:26] <tada> doush65536: it only happens when you choose from autcomplete list
[09:03:36] <grafi> doug65536 tada exactly
[09:03:38] <Space_> Aksu: $('div').click(function() {});
[09:03:40] <doug65536> tada: choose from?
[09:03:41] <tada> doug65536: not otherwise, new tags are fine...
[09:03:46] <aksu> no jquery
[09:03:49] <aksu> javascript
[09:03:55] <Space_> oh
[09:04:14] <Space_> .addEvent('click' function() {}
[09:04:23] <Space_> or .addEventListener
[09:04:32] <aksu> can i put it on if
[09:04:42] <aksu> like if element is clicked
[09:04:52] <tada> doush65536: when you start typing new tag which is in suggested list (availableTags) and not choose but type part of it
[09:05:03] <Space_> just add that functionality in the function
[09:05:04] <tada> grafi: do you have solution?
[09:05:10] <aksu> okk
[09:05:11] <Space_> if clicked -> do this
[09:05:28] <grafi> i still think the author of the plugin could want this behaviour
[09:05:31] <Levure> Hello !
[09:05:33] <Space_> basicially you are saying  add an event trigger to the dom
[09:05:35] <doug65536> tada: I tried that... it hardly happens
[09:05:53] <Levure> Does this selector is valid ? $(this).children('td:first-child input:first-of-type')
[09:06:02] <tada> grafi: but on click of submit it dispappers, but in other cases where there is no submit button
[09:06:26] <tada> dough65536L it alwasy happen when i try it
[09:06:50] <hlve> what would be the best way to create a function that looks at a group of spans, and adds a class to those which include a number that's greater than 5? ( example html here. jquery needed halp.) http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/87yak/
[09:06:56] <grafi> entering a half finished tag text and then clicking somewhere on the screen just doesnt seem like a use case to me
[09:07:20] <grafi> tada: so you're saying you want to "clean up" the tags before you submit?
[09:07:30] <BillCriswell> hlve: You can use filter().
[09:07:35] <grafi> that could be considerably easier
[09:07:37] <tada> grafi: only the one which are not tags
[09:07:46] <dwarder> what event is firing up when i entering something in an email input type text field and google chrome shows me suggestions and i chose one of the items?
[09:07:54] <grafi> tada: so exactly like when you have a submit button
[09:08:00] <hlve> BillCriswell, I've tried a few different ideas with filter, but couldn't get it to work.
[09:08:04] <tada> grafi: the ones which are tags ....when you hit enter come with a cross sigh
[09:08:08] <dwarder> choese by arrow down and enter
[09:08:10] <tada> grafi: yes
[09:08:13] <grafi> hm
[09:08:15] <BillCriswell> hlve: $('span').filter(function(){ return + $.trim($(this).text()) > 5 }).addClass('over-five')
[09:08:25] <grafi> thats a whole other fix ;)
[09:08:26] <hlve> o.O
[09:08:30] <grafi> i will try :D
[09:08:32] <hlve> Sec, hero. I'll try that. Thanks :)
[09:08:55] <aksu> .addEvent('click' function() {     where i can put my div id???
[09:09:06] <Levure> I don't understand how "$(this).children('td:first-child input:first-of-type')" gives nothing since "$(this).children('td:first-child').html()" show a input in HTML. Am I missing something ? (http://jsfiddle.net/Levure/QLKbA/7/)
[09:09:10] <hlve> works perfect! Thank you!
[09:09:22] <BillCriswell> hlve: Welcome.
[09:09:47] <hlve> I should really brush up on my jQuery. Haven't touched much since I lost my job.
[09:09:48] <hlve> :S\
[09:10:13] <BillCriswell> hlve: That stinks. I'm sure it'll come back.
[09:10:28] <aksu> spaceeee
[09:10:31] <hlve> it's like riding a bike, except without all the excercise and stuff.
[09:10:38] <dwarder> i tested events like: keypress paste click
[09:10:54] <dwarder> and they don't fire up the case i described
[09:11:28] <tada> grafi: what gets triggered when you hit submit
[09:11:33] <joe^> How does the $.ajax method determine when to fire the error function? Is there some parameter in the data object returned that needs to be set?
[09:12:49] <dwarder> anyone?
[09:13:00] <dwarder> ok i'll make a jsfiddle of it
[09:13:05] <tada> doug65536:grafi : any suggestions
[09:15:41] <aaksu> Space_: .addEvent('click' function() {     where i can put my div id???
[09:16:07] <tada> grafi: hello
[09:16:25] * aaksu slaps Space_ around a bit with a large trout
[09:16:30] <Space_> if you are using straight javascript you use document.getElementById('div id").
[09:16:46] <grafi> highlighting me every 2minutes wont get you any closer to a solution :) why dont you also dig into the source of the plugin yourself?
[09:16:47] <aaksu> i have the code in external file
[09:17:37] <Space_> that's fine that it is external, as long as the HTML file is calling it
[09:17:58] <aaksu> is it like this: .addEvent('divid.click' function() {
[09:18:38] <tada> grafi: apologies if that was annoying, i thought you had suggestion for me
[09:18:48] <Space_> no, you can only use certain event "types"
[09:18:57] <grafi> tada: im trying to work one out :)
[09:19:16] <tada> thanks
[09:19:27] <Space_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget.addEventListener
[09:19:31] <Space_> aaksu:
[09:20:10] <aaksu> ok...
[09:21:07] <aaksu> my code stopped working
[09:21:16] <aaksu> i can put it pastebin if u wantr
[09:21:20] <aaksu> want*
[09:22:11] <grafi> tada: where do you have the example with the submit button?
[09:23:01] <dwarder> http://jsfiddle.net/AHVMy/ how do i make it "i got fired" upon chosing google chrome browser suggested email (you will get one after entering a couple times) by arrow down and enter
[09:24:31] <doug65536> dwarder: hmm, good question.
[09:29:30] <grafi> dwarder: include jquery? ^^
[09:29:38] <tada> grafi :http://aehlke.github.io/tag-it/examples.html
[09:30:04] <grafi> but that doesnt really submit anything tada
[09:30:10] <tada> grafi: missed your message earlier http://aehlke.github.io/tag-it/examples.html this page has the example with submit button
[09:30:11] <grafi> it just reloads the page
[09:30:38] <tada> grafi: Single Input Field this example clear the non tagged text
[09:31:40] <grafi> tada: i dont get non tagged text on the first single input field
[09:32:04] <dwarder> grafi: i guess i didn't for after i did this, here is a working version http://jsfiddle.net/a7bbT/
[09:32:12] <dwarder> fork*
[09:32:30] <grafi> tada: nvm i get untagged text, but anyways when you press submit the site is just reset
[09:33:03] <grafi> tada: you could set up a submithandler that just gathers all the finished tags
[09:34:57] <dwarder> grafi: got any ideas?
[09:35:17] <tada> dwarder: no , thought grafi just suggested something
[09:35:55] <tada> grafi: not sure how to get none tag elements
[09:35:56] <grafi> tada: what do you want to submit? like an array of the tags?
[09:36:38] <tada> i just need all added tags ...and clear off the others...
[09:36:50] <dwarder> tada: i was asking about my problem
[09:41:11] <grafi> tada: http://jsfiddle.net/kct22/2/
[09:41:28] <tada> grafi: looking at it
[09:41:42] <grafi> tada: create untagged text, then press submit, below "tags" the finished tags are listed
[09:41:56] <Space_> Aasku: yeah pastebin will work
[09:42:38] <tada> grafi: it seems to work how i exactly want it ot
[09:43:00] <tada> grafi: what did you do :)
[09:43:29] <grafi> tada: its just a handler function on the submit that collects the finished tags
[09:44:06] <grafi> tada: http://jsfiddle.net/kct22/3/ this version even cleans of the unfinished tags
[09:44:17] <dannydagger> can someone help me out with a little problem? the contact form at the bottom of my site.. How can I somehow replace it with another div once the user presses the submit button? instead of opening a new page like it is doing now.. http://www.colorworld.se/testing123/
[09:45:04] <grafi> dannydagger use $.ajax to submit the form
[09:45:06] <tada> grafi: on click of submit you clear off the tags?
[09:45:37] <grafi> tada: jup look at the updated version http://jsfiddle.net/kct22/3/ its purely cosmetical though ;)
[09:45:53] <grafi> tada: not the tags, only the unfinished ones ;)
[09:46:06] <grafi> dwarder: what exactly are you trying to do? :P
[09:46:36] <hlve> another fun question. BillCriswell. http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/87yak/2/ How would you go about wrapping the 'description' text in another span? I've tried wrap();, but can't seem to grab said element
[09:46:56] <dwarder> grafi: i was able to fire this event up upon 'keyup' event
[09:47:02] <dwarder> grafi: solved
[09:47:06] <grafi> okidoke :)
[09:47:09] <BillCriswell> hlve: Do you have control over this HTML? If so this is the wrong approach.
[09:47:12] <dwarder> :)
[09:47:13] <hlve> i don't.
[09:47:23] <hlve> i'm working on a small greasemonkey script
[09:48:00] <tada> grafi: thanks a lot
[09:48:07] <grafi> tada: no problem ;)
[09:48:16] <Nailuj2> hi!
[09:48:17] <tada> really appreciate it
[09:48:22] <tada> you made my day
[09:48:24] <hlve> if i had control over the html, i wouldn't even need to use jquery lol
[09:49:32] <doug65536> tada: you got that sorted out?
[09:49:38] <doug65536> tada: just got back
[09:49:57] <tada> dough65536: yes
[09:50:01] <doug65536> cool
[09:50:14] <wayd3r> Hello
[09:50:20] <BillCriswell> hlve: Does it always have "description:" there?
[09:50:28] <hlve> yeah
[09:50:39] <doug65536> dannydagger: hi
[09:50:42] <hlve> but the desc. text all varies so i can't really search for an end point lol
[09:50:45] <wayd3r> This is a spam demo. I will go out soon.
[09:50:48] <wayd3r> I have a responsive layout and I've created a fading panels animated element with jQuery. I set the jQuery function to only activate if the user is above a certain screen size. However, if I scale the window down, the function still runs.

[09:51:06] <BillCriswell> waysc: What was that?
[09:51:06] <dannydagger> sry
[09:51:07] <hlve> woah
[09:51:09] <dannydagger> doug65536Ä: hi
[09:51:16] <dannydagger> my keyboard is out of control
[09:51:19] <grafi> xD
[09:51:19] <hlve> waysc wanted to get some attention.
[09:51:23] <hlve> er.
[09:51:28] <hlve> way3r*
[09:51:30] <hlve> lol
[09:51:36] <dannydagger> grafi: nevermind that msg, i just found a tutorial :)
[09:51:47] <grafi> dannydagger have fun ;)
[09:52:06] <dannydagger> thanks.. some trial and error here i come :)
[09:52:11] <dannydagger> doug65536: hows it going bro?
[09:52:16] <doug65536> dannydagger: use $.ajaxSubmit and in the complete callback, use $("#div_id").load("someurl") or .html() or something to change div
[09:52:28] <doug65536> dannydagger: good
[09:53:33] <doug65536> dannydagger: let me have a look at page again to see more specifically what you're talking about
[09:53:41] <dannydagger> $.ajaxSubmit in my main.js?
[09:53:46] <dannydagger> www.colorworld.se/testing123
[09:54:17] <hlve> BillCriswell, probably just going to use WrapInner, and then use :contians to remove it
[09:54:18] <hlve> stupid idea?
[09:55:13] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes, which div, and replace with what?
[09:55:24] <doug65536> dannydagger: something not on page yet?
[09:55:27] <hlve> well. shit. that didn't work
[09:55:33] <dannydagger> the contact form.. when you press submit.. it opens a new page
[09:55:51] <dannydagger> I want to replace the whole contact form, with that a new div that is not on the page yet
[09:55:59] <dannydagger> instead of opening a new page
[09:55:59] <doug65536> dannydagger: replace the content of #kontacktuppgifter ?
[09:56:03] <dannydagger> yeah
[09:56:25] <doug65536> dannydagger: oh the whole #kontakt div
[09:56:35] <doug65536> dannydagger: easy
[09:56:46] <dannydagger> not the whole #Kontakt div.. I will add a class name and update, 1 sec
[09:57:07] <dannydagger> only the contact form.. i will name the wrapper and update in a sec
[09:57:36] <grafi> hlve http://jsfiddle.net/87yak/4/ xD whacky
[09:57:36] <doug65536> dannydagger: yep, can easily replace any amount of page with something else from file or from on the page etc
[09:57:52] <BillCriswell> hlve: How consistent is that HTML?
[09:58:08] <hlve> pretty consistant. It's just some forum I visit often
[09:58:09] <BillCriswell> $('.topictitle').parent().contents().eq(4) should be able to do it, but it's not very stable.
[09:58:09] <dannydagger> doug65536: ok the #formular div
[09:58:16] <hlve> really appreciate the help :)
[09:58:22] <Levure> Please, is it possible to have some help on that fiddle of 16 lines (http://jsfiddle.net/Levure/QLKbA/9/) ? I think it is a selector problem, but I don't find the solution ?
[09:58:32] <dannydagger> doug65536: easily? sounds awesome :) I dont know anything that $.ajax stuff though :/
[09:58:37] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/87yak/5/ can also work, but it's all hacky.
[09:58:54] <grafi> nice BillCriswell
[09:58:56] <grafi> xD
[09:59:25] <grafi> there should be an award for "most hackiest solution of the day"
[10:00:03] <BillCriswell> $('.topictitle').parent().contents().eq(4) might actually be more reliable lol
[10:00:23] <doug65536> dannydagger: formular is the id?
[10:00:29] <dannydagger> yeah
[10:00:29] <BillCriswell> $('.topictitle').parent().contents().eq(4).wrap('<span class="textNode"/>')
[10:00:30] <BillCriswell> ewww
[10:00:40] <doug65536> dannydagger: is it uploaded?
[10:00:54] <doug65536> dannydagger: shouldn't really matter.. 1 sec
[10:01:04] <dannydagger> yes its uploaded... the new div that I want to replace it with is not uploaded yet though
[10:01:10] <doug65536> ok np
[10:01:11] <BillCriswell> grafi: It's fun to come up with, just feels dirty.
[10:01:19] <grafi> true
[10:05:49] <BillCriswell> I'm the ODB as you can see.
[10:06:38] <json-smith> anyone available to help with ajax load issue ??
[10:09:13] <json-smith> can anyone help with ajax load problem $.load() ?
[10:10:50] <grafi> not if you dont post the full problem json-smith
[10:11:08] <json-smith> Grafi - with pleasure ...
[10:11:38] <doug65536> dannydagger: here's partially completed thing. is it uploaded? https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6157614
[10:11:41] <json-smith> calling a full html document with html and script.
[10:12:07] <json-smith> The script keeps getting chopped when I try to render
[10:12:13] * Levure stills looking for jQuery selector help
[10:12:36] <json-smith> I want to loose everyting but the html and script within the body tag, and for the script to run
[10:12:41] <doug65536> dannydagger: gifter thing?
[10:12:52] <dannydagger> 1 sec doug65536 gonna see.. what should I name the div that is going to replace the contact form?
[10:13:06] <doug65536> dannydagger: whatever you like, I don't know your language :)
[10:14:01] <dannydagger> ok 1 sec just trying to figure out what u have done here.. does the div have to be the same size as the contact form or can it be smaller or bigger?
[10:14:39] <doug65536> dannydagger: can be any size as long as the div that contains it allows for it and doesn't have overflow: hidden or whatever. mostly anything will work
[10:14:40] <json-smith> @grafi - that make sense ?
[10:15:25] <grafi> so basically you use load to get a html page, and want to keep the body tag content?
[10:15:26] <dannydagger> doug65536: should i put that new div display:none initially or something?
[10:15:31] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes
[10:15:45] <dannydagger> ok
[10:15:52] <doug65536> dannydagger: pretend the html inside the target element disappears and suddenly becomes what you want
[10:15:54] <json-smith> yes
[10:16:48] <json-smith> if you use load with a url and the tag you want to extract - it will not execute the script (as per documentation)
[10:17:23] <Mrgoose> doug
[10:17:30] <json-smith> I tried $.get, but have been unsuccessful in trying to parse the returned data
[10:17:33] <Mrgoose> doug65536, you still around?
[10:17:33] <dannydagger> doug65536: ok 5min
[10:17:39] <Mrgoose> doug65536, you still around?
[10:17:42] <doug65536> Mrgoose: me?
[10:17:45] <json-smith> !pastebin
[10:17:46] <Mrgoose> hello
[10:18:51] <grafi> json-smith is the script inline code?
[10:18:53] <doug65536> dannydagger: I'll set it up so if javascript is disabled, it does what it does now. otherwise fancy ajax + page modification
[10:19:19] <Mrgoose> doug65536, what was the thing you suggested?  session cache expire?
[10:19:20] <json-smith> yes <script...> script here </script>
[10:19:32] <json-smith> what's the pastebin command ?
[10:19:41] <sainaen> Levure, is it what are you trying to get: http://jsfiddle.net/QLKbA/10/ ?
[10:20:27] <tada> grafi: thanks once again, it worked in the code i was using it...thought it was simple fix but sometime thinking out of the box is hard
[10:20:45] <tada> grafi: untill someone shows you
[10:21:08] <grafi> tada: its always easy once you know how it works xP
[10:21:10] <doug65536> Mrgoose: Cache-Control: max-age=<seconds>
[10:21:22] <doug65536> Mrgoose: http header
[10:25:46] <dannydagger> doug65536: ok i've just added a black little div below the contact form.. just check if everything looks ok and I will put display: none on it
[10:25:51] <dannydagger> uploaded the change
[10:26:27] <dannydagger> i put your code in the bottom of main.js as well
[10:27:22] <doug65536> dannydagger: how much should it replace?
[10:27:42] <dannydagger> the whole contact form should dissapear, I will make this div bigger in a bit
[10:27:49] <alii> Hi, I've got a button in html5 that activates my google auth script, Is it possible to use a jquery function to automatically push this button for me so I don't have to keep doing so in development?
[10:27:59] <doug65536> dannydagger: ok
[10:28:30] <grafi> alii try .click()
[10:29:06] <Mrgoose> thanks
[10:29:19] <alii> grafi: thanks for the suggestion, didn't work :(
[10:29:29] <grafi> hm
[10:31:04] <grafi> alii what about .trigger('click')
[10:31:16] <doug65536> dannydagger: https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6157614
[10:31:59] <doug65536> dannydagger: it might end up invisible... easily fixed if so
[10:32:11] <dannydagger> uploaded the change
[10:32:17] <alii> grafi: still no luck :/
[10:32:30] <doug65536> dannydagger: you can make sure mails get sent right? you can check the mail?
[10:32:31] <grafi> then im fresh out of ideas :(
[10:32:40] <dannydagger> 1 sec
[10:34:17] <alii> grafi: thanks for trying
[10:34:36] <dannydagger> doug65536: hmm no I am not getting the mails anymore
[10:34:38] <doug65536> dannydagger: non-critical change - only says it worked if submit succeeds https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6157614
[10:34:49] <doug65536> dannydagger: let me debug. 1 sec
[10:34:51] <grafi> alii how does the button activate the script?
[10:35:07] <dannydagger> alright
[10:35:58] <clime> hey guys, should this piece of code work or is these something wrong:                     objectListModal.find('iframe').html(data);                   data is html that I load by ajax. I work with iframes for the first time. Don't know if there is some trick.
[10:36:07] <alii> there's a function in my auth script called handleAuthorized() that does doc.getelementByID('make-api-button
[10:36:23] <alii> there's a function in my auth script called handleAuthorized() that does doc.getelementByID('make-api-button').onclick = makeApiCall
[10:36:25] <dannydagger> doug65536: in mailer.php there is this line which is preveting the jquery to work i think
[10:36:26] <dannydagger> header('Location: confirmation.htm');
[10:36:38] <dannydagger> should i remove it completely?
[10:36:45] <dannydagger> or change it?
[10:36:45] <Snerf> clime. thats not how you reference an iframe,a nd not how you load data in it
[10:37:04] <grafi> alii so makeApiCall() would trigger the script?
[10:37:14] <doug65536> dannydagger: that should be ok
[10:37:29] <doug65536> dannydagger: keep it for if javascript is disabled on their browser
[10:37:32] <dannydagger> ah okok
[10:39:14] <doug65536> dannydagger: typo fix https://gist.github.com/doug65536/6157614
[10:39:25] <alii> grafi: I think so, I'm a noob and I got this code from the helloAnalytics tutorial, so I assume it would
[10:40:05] <grafi> alii then why dont you just call it once the page has finished loading? :p
[10:40:05] <alii> grafi: I'm an idiot, your right that worked perfectly
[10:40:09] <dannydagger> doug65536: uploaded change
[10:40:45] <dannydagger> doug65536: you have method GET in the jquery, and I have POST in the mailer.php .. does it make any difference?
[10:40:46] <alii> I thought it might mess up with the other authorization function(there's two steps) but I realized the handleAuth section means that's already been taken care of :d
[10:41:02] <clime> Snerf: ok, i see. Could you give me some hints? I want to insert content into that iframe that is loaded by ajax. Can't find much about this on net.
[10:41:06] <alii> grafi: thanks
[10:41:23] <grafi> alii no problem :)
[10:41:34] <doug65536> dannydagger: it tries to read the method attribute and if it's not there it uses GET
[10:41:57] <dannydagger> ah ok
[10:42:22] <clime> I have found that i need to use contents() on that iframe element...ill try
[10:44:59] <dannydagger> doug65536: my debug says TypeError: $(...) is not a function $(function() {
[10:45:04] <dannydagger> for that function
[10:45:47] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes I'm trying to see what's wrong...
[10:46:13] <doug65536> comma at end of line 381?
[10:46:14] <doug65536> remove it
[10:46:31] <dannydagger> removed and uploaded
[10:49:27] <Levure> sainaen: Yes, thanks you ! :-)
[10:49:37] <Levure> Do you know why the td:first-child input:first-of-type selector was not giving the excepted result ?
[10:52:18] <doug65536> dannydagger: my code snippet is valid...
[10:52:57] <doug65536> how is $ not defined there?
[10:53:33] <dannydagger> not sure, it says so in the firebug console for firefox
[10:53:58] <dannydagger> TypeError: $(...) is not a function
[10:54:08] <dannydagger> and there points to that function
[10:54:10] <dannydagger> then*

[10:57:25] <dannydagger> done and uploaded
[10:57:42] <dannydagger> ah
[10:57:43] <dannydagger> works now
[10:58:06] <dannydagger> as usual, you are a genious :)
[10:59:11] <doug65536> dannydagger: mail worked?
[10:59:16] <dannydagger> gonna check 1 sec
[10:59:20] <dwarder> does .trigger supports delegate as .on?
[10:59:21] <doug65536> I sent you a a a a a a a mail
[10:59:56] <dannydagger> doug65536: nah it didnt work
[11:00:01] <doug65536> dannydagger: we should do some basic validation there. there's an html5 think that will auto-enforce valid mail
[11:00:12] <doug65536> ok, I'll see what comes back from server... 1 sec
[11:00:15] <Levure> sainaen: thanks again for the tip about find() !
[11:00:30] <dannydagger> i tried to put some server side validation there but my skills were limited lol
[11:00:35] <dannydagger> so i gave up
[11:01:54] <Mrgoose> doug65536, hmm   <meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="max-age=3600"/> doesnt seem to work :( still loads all the data
[11:02:26] <doug65536> dannydagger: Vi har nu mottagit ditt meddelande och återkopplar till dig snarast. ?
[11:02:28] <dwarder> or do i need a delegate to .trigger?
[11:02:54] <dannydagger> doug65536: yeah? that means "we have now recieved your msg and will get back to you asap"
[11:03:20] <doug65536> maybe the server doesn't like bogus 'a' reply to address
[11:03:29] <dannydagger> ill change it
[11:03:29] <richwestcoast> jquery >>>> *
[11:03:45] <dannydagger> maybe it's because the email adress is at another webhost?
[11:03:52] <doug65536> dannydagger: do a real post with non-junk values
[11:03:59] <grafi> lulz
[11:04:02] <dannydagger> ok
[11:04:18] <doug65536> dannydagger:  we can put some validation there too
[11:05:07] <dannydagger> doug65536: ok changed it and re-uploaded confirmation.htm.. is it even accessing that now after the jquery?
[11:05:24] <doug65536> dannydagger: it will if the user has javascript disabled
[11:05:35] <dannydagger> still no mail
[11:05:36] <doug65536> dannydagger: and it sends it even if javascript is enabled
[11:05:39] <dannydagger> cool
[11:05:58] <doug65536> dannydagger: my code discards it after it sees 200 OK status
[11:06:16] <dannydagger> what's 200 ok status?
[11:06:29] <doug65536> dannydagger: it's the "no error" http response
[11:06:34] <doug65536> "it worked"
[11:06:37] <dannydagger> ah ok
[11:07:29] <dannydagger> should i try adding my email address that belongs to this host where the site is now? colorworld.se ?
[11:07:35] <dannydagger> instead of lemonbite.se
[11:07:53] <doug65536> dannydagger: in the form? anyone's address needs to work right?
[11:08:00] <doug65536> did the form ever work?
[11:08:06] <dannydagger> yeah it did
[11:08:15] <dannydagger> doug65536: not in the form, in mailer.php
[11:08:21] <dannydagger> $to = "info@lemonbite.se";
[11:08:45] <doug65536> dannydagger: yes
[11:08:53] <doug65536> servers are picky about that - anti-spam
[11:09:27] <doug65536> but it worked before right? weird
[11:10:00] <doug65536> dannydagger:  can you put something in the php for me?
[11:10:03] <dannydagger> it did.. gonna try to remove the js if colorworld.se email doesnt work
[11:10:03] <dannydagger> sure what
[11:10:10] <sainaen> Levure, I'm sorry, was afk. Problem was that you've used children() to find not childrent element (`input`). if I'd have to change as little as possible in your code, it'll become like this: http://jsfiddle.net/QLKbA/11/
[11:10:49] <doug65536> <?php echo var_dump($_POST); ?>         <-- put that near the start of the body
[11:10:51] <dannydagger> works when i changed the email doug
[11:10:56] <doug65536> ok
[11:11:20] <dannydagger> however it doesnt display the email in the mail, the user email from the contact form
[11:11:33] <doug65536> dannydagger: let's put some validation there so people won't accidentally send you garbage emails
[11:11:41] <doug65536> dannydagger: that needs to be fixed in the php I think
[11:11:44] <dannydagger> sure
[11:12:02] <doug65536> the php calls mail( ... etc ...) ?
[11:12:11] <dannydagger> should i put that line above the $body = " From:.... instead of at the top?
[11:12:23] <dannydagger> yes.. $email = filter_var($_POST['email'], FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL);
[11:12:29] <doug65536> ah, right. it just redirects...
[11:12:39] <doug65536> hmmm.
[11:13:21] <doug65536> there's a header("Location: ....whatever....") in there now right, at the end?
[11:13:31] <dannydagger> yeah
[11:13:51] <dannydagger> I can send you mailer.php on skype if u wish to see it
[11:13:53] <doug65536> dannydagger: comment that out with // and put the vardump thing at the very end of the php file
[11:13:56] <doug65536> ok
[11:15:11] <doug65536> dannydagger:  PM
[11:15:24] <naeluh> yo
[11:15:34] <dwarder> how do i emulate this $('#outer_div').trigger('click','#ajax_content_div',function(){ ...
[11:16:46] <Krambiorix> hi, i have a form with input text, checkboxes, select boxes... I want if the user changes any kind of box, to fire an event... Is that possible?
[11:17:12] <BillCriswell> Krambiorix: Just do $('form').on('change', doSomething );
[11:17:25] <BillCriswell> The change event from the children will bubble up to the form parent.
[11:17:47] <Krambiorix> BillCriswell, thx!
[11:17:51] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[11:18:22] <dwarder> anyone?
[11:20:51] <BillCriswell> dwarder: Your code is creating weird recursion in my brain.
[11:21:14] <blindMoe> BillCriswell: your brain is creating weird recursion in his code
[11:21:38] <BillCriswell> IF there was any chance of me getting out of that one blindMoe just screwed it up.
[11:22:06] <blindMoe> you're welcome ;)
[11:22:16] <grafi> not a very nice thing to do
[11:22:47] <BillCriswell> dwarder: Why not just $('#ajax_content_div').trigger('click') ?
[11:45:32] <rga> Hello guys
[11:45:33] <rga> I have a problem with jquery mobile, my application is returning to page Previous mobile.changePage when I use $ ()
[11:45:42] <JFranks> Apparently you can use xpath selectors by tweaking them a bit? How would I reference this element in jquery? //*[@id="nav"]/li[4]/a
[11:46:04] * felipeduardo test
[11:46:26] * JFranks pongs
[11:46:35] <tw2113> return true
[11:47:51] <BillCriswell> JFranks: $('#nav li:eq(4) a')
[11:48:21] <BillCriswell> I believe. It's been a while since I went down the xpath.
[11:48:22] <JFranks> BillCriswell: Awesome! Thanks.. I just needed an example.. Wheee! :)
[11:49:24] <JFranks> BillCriswell: I saw something close with "li:nth-child(4)" but made no sense?
[11:50:34] <BillCriswell> It's about the same.
[11:51:01] <BillCriswell> I just think the :eq() makes more sense, the nth-child is from CSS
[11:53:00] <JFranks> BillCriswell: Hmm.. all testing in the chrome console fails..
[11:53:12] <JFranks> TypeError: Cannot call method 'append' of null
[11:54:56] <dabear> BillCriswell: I think this would be more precise: "*[id='nav']>li:nth-child(4n)>a"
[11:55:11] <dabear> would be easier to test with some data
[11:56:00] <BillCriswell> dabear: I disagree. Why *[id='nav'] will selec the same thing as #nav
[11:56:02] <JFranks> dabear: http://www.security-camera-warehouse.com/   is my test page.. trying to click on "dvr" for a challenge..
[11:57:01] <dabear> BillCriswell: his expath selects all elements with that id, your jquery selector selects the first element with that id :)
[11:57:21] <BillCriswell> dabear: If you have more than one element with the same ID you're doing it wrong haha
[11:57:31] <dabear> totally agree
[11:57:56] <JFranks> But I doubt that's what's failing.. hmm would laugh if that's it.. Oh man.
[11:58:51] <BillCriswell> JFranks: Failing to replicate. The word DVR shows up a lot.
[11:59:34] <JFranks> Nope.. not the problem here.. looks like it's still not a valid selector.. (The DVR link in the top nav menu.. Line 327 in the source)
[11:59:53] <JFranks> Er 326?
[12:00:03] <dabear> jQuery("*[id='nav']>li:nth-child(4)>a") selects the first dvr element
[12:00:57] <JFranks> Hmmm it does.. Why did I have to use 'jQuery()' vs. '$'?
[12:01:01] <JFranks> Aggh.. :)
[12:01:04] <dabear> jQuery("a[href='/dvr/']") //easuer
[12:01:05] <fauntle> does anyone here have experience with $.pjax? No matter what I do, I can't get it to work in Chrome
[12:01:09] <dabear> easier*
[12:01:23] <BillCriswell> JFranks: Guess you're running $.noConflict()
[12:02:00] <JFranks> BillCriswell: Odd stuff.. I saw jQuery crap so I just assumed "$" should work.. Oh fun.. Thanks for the variety of approaches? ;)
[12:02:12] <BillCriswell> There's always 100 ways.
[12:02:14] <JFranks> s/crap/awesome/
[12:02:26] <Cryp71c> I'm vaguely familiar with attr / prop, but there seems to be contention as to which to use when reading / writing and with different element / attribute types.
[12:03:15] <codepython777> http://jsfiddle.net/52KYT/3/ - how do i fix this?
[12:04:06] <shoky> Cryp71c: yep.
[12:05:09] <BillCriswell> codepython777: Where is switch-change defined? Why are you trying get the value of a div?
[12:05:31] <Cryp71c> shoky, sorry, didn't state a question. Is there any hard and fast rules that work more frequently than others or is it under contention for good reason?
[12:06:14] <shoky> Cryp71c: i could say that in most cases you should use .prop.. but there are many cases where you'd want .attr instead
[12:08:24] <shoky> Cryp71c: but generally.. properties are the runtime javascript properties of the DOM nodes. and attributes are the html attributes you put in your html.  but for many built-in props/attrs, browsers keep the attrs/props in sync with each other, sometimes one-way, sometimes two-way, depending on which prop
[12:09:28] <BillCriswell> shoky: It's like a wild browser adventure.
[12:09:49] * shoky whee
[12:10:04] <naeluh> Hi I am trying to increment an input field by 1 for every 10 in another input field so basically 10 = 1 , 20 = 2 ,30 =3, and so on but 12 would be 12 would be equal to 1 also
[12:10:57] <shoky> Cryp71c: but feel free to ask about a specific property if you're not sure what's best to use
[12:13:12] <JFranks> Ha! onclick="jQuery("a[href='/dvr/']").click();" ... R'uh-oh scooby
[12:14:35] <JFranks> It's the first time I've been tempted to assign an attribute without "" ..
[12:16:16] <JFranks> Oh how I hate CMS based updates.. Why can't I just edit/add a <script> block?!
[12:22:03] <JFranks> Wow..  onclick="jQuery(&quot;a[href='/dvr/']&quot;).click();"
[12:25:45] <json-smith> Grafi has been helping me out with an ajax problem I have - anyone available to take over - Grafi is now offline (nothing to do with me !)
[12:26:23] * JFranks laughs
[12:26:48] <jKlaus> I'm going to go out on a limb and guess json-smith's first name is Jason
[12:27:11] <tw2113> i'll lol if it's actually hank
[12:27:15] <json-smith> You have just got a broken limb
[12:27:46] <json-smith> I'm guessing tw2113 is also a made up name
[12:27:51] <json-smith> :-)
[12:28:01] <tw2113> i have cruel cryptic parents
[12:28:14] <json-smith> hahahaha
[12:28:46] <tw2113> i start rumors about it being the location of the Ark of the Covenant
[12:29:09] <json-smith> Now that's interesting #retweet
[12:30:15] <json-smith> Now it's confrmed we all have no idea who we're talking to - who's gonna sort my ajax problem out
[12:30:38] <json-smith> this is where everyone leaves the chat ........
[12:30:57] <KeyLimePi> hello
[12:32:20] <clime> hey anyon could help me with jquery.pjax? I am trying to prevent pushing the new location (and chaninhe url) by passing push: true into options. For some reason it does not work though
[12:32:57] <clime> *(and changing url)
[12:33:25] <clime> sry i am passing push: false of course
[12:37:02] <clime> i don't get it, if i debug pjax push is false and replace is false, it does't push as i can isee but the url is still being changed. why...
[12:38:48] <Krambiorix> hi, i have an array with serialized data like :  data.bestuurdersrp.push($(this).serializeArray())   how can i send it with ajax() ?
[12:38:50] <clime> how can url be changed but state not pushed?
[12:40:19] <duch_kazatel> clime - you can't.
[12:40:29] <shoky> Krambiorix: $.ajax({..., data: $(form).serializeArray() })
[12:40:51] <Krambiorix> shoky,  they are multiple separate forms
[12:41:01] <Krambiorix> which i have to put in arrays
[12:41:35] <shoky> `api jQuery.merge
[12:41:35] <b-ot> shoky: jQuery.merge(): Merge the contents of two arrays together into the first array.  http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.merge/
[12:43:09] <duch_kazatel> clime - you could use replacestate instead, but it depends on what you're looking to do.
[12:43:39] <clime> duch_kazatel: okthx (diky:))
[12:45:26] <sunbeam> with $.ajax how can i trigger an error
[12:49:36] <Krambiorix> shoky,  can you help ? http://pastebin.com/P9zSfUqi
[12:50:02] <Krambiorix> shoky, in firebug the post data is empty :s
[12:58:36] <clime> anyone has experience with jquery pjax? I am passing push:false so that state is not pushed but it still changes the url oO.
[12:58:38] <sunbeam> nvm
[12:59:49] <clime> i would appreciate any advice cause this is just like headbricker
[13:03:29] <duch_kazatel> clime are you trying to replace the current state?
[13:04:20] <clime> duch_kazatel: i am trying to make just a common ajax call using pjax. without any pushing/replacing/changing urls/etc
[13:04:35] <duch_kazatel> ... why are you using pjax for thjat?
[13:04:41] <duch_kazatel> why not just use the jquery method for it?
[13:05:37] <clime> duch_kazatel: because i have built templates that uses pjax with url pushing and now i am trying to reuse them without these features
[13:06:54] <duch_kazatel> the entire point of pjax is to support pushstates.
[13:09:14] <Mehrdad> hello. is there a known issue with the slide effect in IE 10?
[13:10:48] <Mehrdad> i don't see the effect, and i remember it was working before in IE 9
[13:11:07] <Mehrdad> i run the effect on document.ready event on a div
[13:13:12] <Mehrdad> nvm, sorted out
[13:15:20] <clime> ok i have found out why. If url contains hash, it replaces states without respect to push and replace options.
[13:15:30] <clime> (i mean jquery pjax
[13:24:25] <darthbator> hey guys I had a quick question on how I could use jquery to set the selected option of an html select element on page load? Right now I am doing something that looks like this
[13:24:25] <darthbator> https://gist.github.com/darthbator/6159274
[13:24:36] <darthbator> but that does not seem to be setting the value
[13:27:27] <grafi> you probably want to compare against $(this).val() darthbator
[13:27:46] <grafi> or something
[13:28:16] <darthbator> lemme try!
[13:28:43] <darthbator> still does not seem to work
[13:29:06] <grafi> so what is $.cookie('dropdown') ?
[13:30:10] <darthbator> https://gist.github.com/darthbator/6159336
[13:31:39] <grafi> darthbator http://jsfiddle.net/AMRS6/
[13:31:53] <horsik> hi
[13:32:13] <grafi> so compare against .val() but filter the options not the select ;)
[13:33:04] <darthbator> <3
[13:33:05] <horsik> jquery hides pseudo elements during animations, is there some way to override this behavior?
[13:34:29] <grafi> oO
[13:34:39] <grafi> how do you hide pseudo elements :o
[13:36:35] <intellix> .button:first-child { display: none; }
[13:37:00] <horsik> grafi: I don't, jquery does
[13:37:11] <grafi> but how
[13:42:40] <whatthepoop> anyone run into issues using jquery validate + the html5 'form' attribute on input elements (http://html5doctor.com/html5-forms-introduction-and-new-attributes/#attr-form)?
[13:42:41] <tw2113> love me a js exception error that doesn't tell the actual error
[13:43:01] <horsik> grafi: http://jsfiddle.net/pmkvP/1/
[13:43:01] <whatthepoop> as soon as I use the html5 'form' attribute my form still submits fine but no longer goes through the validator
[13:43:27] <horsik> I don't know how but it does and I want to prevent this
[13:52:24] <horsik> whatthepoop: I don't think that using client-side for validation is a good idea
[13:53:31] <whatthepoop> horsik: thanks, we have both though: back-end validation (prior to writing to database), and front-end validation (for usability, prior to sending to backend)
[13:53:52] <horsik> whatthepoop: :)
[13:54:58] <whatthepoop> I'm having trouble with the latter, obviously... it's basically a nested form issue -- one static/standard form, and one inline ajax form... 'form' elements cannot be nested, so I'm using the html5 'form' attribute per input field to create the association...but that's where jquery validate seems to break. :(
[14:07:05] <filkinsteez> can you dyamically crop images with jcrop?
[14:07:10] <filkinsteez> dynamically*
[14:09:56] <Space_> What do you mean by dynamically?
[14:11:21] <Space_> !alert Filkinsteez
[14:12:18] <filkinsteez> So I have some erb that dynamically generates step-by-step instructions based on a users input. In each step there is text and then at least one image with an image tag overlaid on top (highlights what the step instruction text is referring to). The problem is right now the image dimensions are too big to be conducive for displaying on mobile. (Their max width is 640px). I have the X-Y position of each tag so I wan
[14:12:18] <filkinsteez> t to dynamically crop around each tag to reduce their width when the instructions load (I think 300px would be fine). I was wondering how I would do this with jcrop?
[14:12:41] <filkinsteez> or if even possible
[14:13:23] <Space_> well Jcrop is more for input
[14:13:28] <Space_> but I supposed you can
[14:13:34] <filkinsteez> ya that's what i was thinking
[14:13:41] <filkinsteez> do you think there would be other more efficient ways?
[14:13:51] <filkinsteez> i was thinking something with the image margins?
[14:14:28] <Space_> well, you can set the parent container to overflow:hidden and set the img to > the width of the parent
[14:14:31] <Space_> that may work
[14:14:48] <Space_> in a sense zooming
[14:16:02] <filkinsteez> hmm thats an interesting idea
[14:20:08] <Space_> http://jsfiddle.net/4ECtT/
[14:20:28] <Space_> you can see the offset
[14:22:57] <Space_> let me know if that works
[14:57:57] <Krambiorix> ahem?
[14:58:59] <duch_kazatel> ?"
[15:11:36] <Krambiorix> duch_kazatel, is it possible to serialize multiple forms with the same fields and pass it as an array to ajax() ?
[15:15:05] <kippi> hey
[15:18:16] <kippi> I am using the ui resizable to resize div's, are there any options to stop it from resizing over other divs?
[15:35:57] <orentanay> I'm having a really hard tme getting an image upload solution to work without a page reload. Most of the pluging seems very large and full of features I don't need. I've tried an iframe aproach (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7909161/jquery-iframe-file-upload) but the result was unpredictable. How do you do file uploads without a page reload? Thanks.
[15:37:17] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to submit it through ajax.
[15:38:26] <orentanay> file upload via ajax has very limited browser support. Any other suggestions that may not be as slick, but more compatible w/ a wider range of browsers? thanks.
[15:39:26] <duch_kazatel> how far back do you need to support?
[15:40:29] <orentanay> back to ie6 would be great, but I'm not crazy. IE7 would be great, but I can live w/ ie8+
[15:40:53] <duch_kazatel> and what problems were you having with the iframe submission setup?
[15:40:57] <orentanay> notice I'm only concerned about IE. users of all other browsers have all upgraded.
[15:41:15] <duch_kazatel> lol
[15:41:46] <duch_kazatel> you're probably going to have to get a graceful degredation setup going to handle old browsers.  why don't you want the page to reload?
[15:42:41] <orentanay> When I hit submit, the browser would just do a normal form submission for IE9 w/ full page relaod, and on Chrome it would seem like the page is stuttering and flickering w/ the relaod/stop button alternating very quickly. It made me think the browsers was crashing.
[15:43:26] <orentanay> I was given a parameter that this is a one page app. :-(
[15:43:27] <duch_kazatel> did you prevent default on the event?
[15:43:42] <duch_kazatel> you could also post back to the page itself and have it reload.
[15:44:34] <orentanay> I'm using jquery.validator so in the submitHandler: function(form) { it does not seem to like it when I add event to the passed references, I e.preventdefault() seems out, so I was using return false
[15:44:34] <owen1> i want to send ajax request with some perfarmance data. when is the last possible moment/event i can do that in a page lifecycle?
[15:45:11] <duch_kazatel> code sample, orentanay?
[15:45:37] <orentanay> I can't show the actual page (firewall), but I'll throw it on pastebin
[15:45:56] <duch_kazatel> could you do like jsfiddle instead?
[15:46:01] <duch_kazatel> i can't run samples on pastebin
[15:46:08] <sunbeam> whats the best way to refresh the current page?
[15:46:30] <sunbeam> reload I mean
[15:46:31] <duch_kazatel> local.reload() iirc
[15:46:40] <duch_kazatel> err, location.reload()
[15:52:56] <orentanay> thanks for the help duc_kazatel, in breaking down my problem, I say right away that I was creating a conflict in my code.
[15:55:34] <sunbeam> thanks duch_kazatel
[15:55:58] <duch_kazatel> np.
[15:58:07] <JFranks> http://jsbin.com/iqafol/2/edit  ..  "m" is a link to edit a previous version of the jsbin .. "Click Me" should .click(); "m" .. and "Append Me" is the same selector as "Click Me" but does an .append(); instead.. Why does the .click(); fail and how can I make it work? ;)
[16:02:36] <richcollins> Why might my draggable element respond very slowly to mouse movement?
[16:02:49] <Snerf> .click does nothing for the 1st button
[16:05:13] <JFranks> Snerf: Yes .. I take issue with the 'nothing' and seek to change it to 'something' .. even an error message would be quaint..
[16:08:43] <JFranks> So yes.. it's the selector that's the issue. . http://jsbin.com/iqafol/6/
[16:14:07] <naeluh> hey I am trying to check if something is 10 or greater or and empty input field can I can get it to check correclty for 10 or greater but the empty field I can figure it out here is my code http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/xhSxQ/
[16:16:41] <duch_kazatel> could you provide some sort of context for the HTML?
[16:16:58] <naeluh> yeah
[16:17:18] <duch_kazatel> and setup that fiddle so it uses jquery, etc.?
[16:20:08] <JFranks> if document.getElementById('[INPUTID]').length > 0   .. not empty? :)
[16:20:23] <JFranks> oh wait
[16:20:31] <JFranks> .val.length?
[16:27:43] <naeluh> http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/xhSxQ/
[16:27:49] <naeluh> ok there it is
[16:28:30] <horsik> omg
[16:29:27] <horsik> what keywords should I use to find this kind of image http://www.istockphoto.com/stock-video-13117264-energy-particle.php?st=bbf42e4
[16:29:27] <duch_kazatel> ?
[16:29:56] <horsik> forest, fog, mist, back lit gives mi nothing
[16:29:57] <richcollins> why might jquery animate changes using offset()?
[16:31:39] <naeluh> ok  alright I will just figure it thanks
[16:42:13] <naeluh> I am just wondering why doesnt this check for 10 or greater and 0 (grades.length >= 10 || grades.length === 0)
[16:42:23] <naeluh> or 0
[16:42:28] <naeluh> not and
[16:44:06] <JFranks> .length is the string length.. so  "foo" = 3 .. "10" = 2
[16:45:02] <naeluh> JFranks: thanks I got it   grades.length != '' this worked
[16:51:07] <tds5016> hi all. I'm trying to use qTip2 plugin with jquery and I'm loading it via require.js...
[16:51:19] <tds5016> when I load it, it is looking for eventEmitter and eventie.js
[16:51:36] <tds5016> They don't seem to come with the plugin's download; so I'm not exactly sure where the bug is coming from.
[16:53:22] <tds5016> anyone in here? It's too quiet for this channel. lol.
[17:00:12] <richcollins> How do I drag an element out of its parent and into another element?
[17:00:27] <richcollins> when I move beyond the border the element is clipped
[17:01:42] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.
[17:01:44] <duch_kazatel> please.
[17:02:17] <grafi> anyone here good with google analytics by chance? i have a question about campaigns :|
[17:08:53] <Whirl3d> richcollins, consider using jqueryUI with .draggable and .dropable
[17:09:01] <richcollins> yeah that's what I'm doing
[17:09:04] <richcollins> here is a fiddle ...
[17:09:26] <duch_kazatel> five bucks says it's a z-indexing/overflow problem.
[17:09:31] <richcollins> http://jsfiddle.net/ymqMH/
[17:09:42] <richcollins> duch_kazatel: Yes I'm using overflow:auto
[17:09:51] <richcollins> z-indexing is a problem as well
[17:10:07] <richcollins> I started to roll my own where I remove the element and add it to document
[17:10:13] <richcollins> but draggable doesn't like that
[17:10:23] <duch_kazatel> change overflow to "visible"
[17:10:24] <duch_kazatel> done
[17:10:32] <duch_kazatel> so you have overflow:visible;
[17:10:47] <richcollins> duch_kazatel: This is a set of images in a scrolling div
[17:11:00] <richcollins> I need to drag them over into a selection area
[17:11:04] <duch_kazatel> ...
[17:11:26] <duch_kazatel> i assume the scrolling div only needs to scroll in one direction, right?
[17:11:34] <richcollins> yeah just down
[17:11:35] <richcollins> and up
[17:11:42] <richcollins> I'll try that ...
[17:13:25] <richcollins> so overflow-y:scroll;overflow-x:visible;
[17:13:26] <richcollins> ?
[17:14:02] <duch_kazatel> try it.
[17:16:17] <richcollins> duch_kazatel: nope: http://jsfiddle.net/ymqMH/1/
[17:16:47] <richcollins> doesn't work unless they're both visibile
[17:21:34] <Whirl3d> why not detach the element on drag start, reattach it to the parent of the droppable then it should work
[17:22:17] <Whirl3d> or put the target droppables as peers to the draggable() and absolute position them outside the box
[17:23:06] <duch_kazatel> you'll need to do something like this, then: http://jsfiddle.net/XarDX/
[17:24:03] <tab1293> hey I am using soundmanager2 to play audio files on my site. Are there any jquery plugins that can act as a time slider for the sound that is playing?
[17:24:31] <tab1293> soundmanager provides all the data (ie time of track, current time, etc) but I need something to help display it
[17:27:28] <duch_kazatel> doesn't look like one exists, tab1293
[17:28:04] <tab1293> duch_kazatel, think I might just try using jquery's ui slider
[17:28:27] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to write the logic for moving it, but that's your best bet
[17:28:42] <tab1293> yeah not too bad
[17:34:56] <Whirl3d> What kind of slider are you building?
[17:36:32] <janthony> Is there any way to have a form return false based on the data returned back from an ajax response when initiated via $('selector here').submit()? I am thinking you cannot as the form would have submitted prior to the ajax finishing to load.
[17:37:05] <janthony> Basically I want the form to process if no errors come back via AJAX, other wise, don't process and return false
[17:44:03] <janthony> I tried return true, I tried running a nested .submit() in the selector.submit(), tried doing a conditional value on a field in the form, etc. Nothing is working. :(
[17:47:21] <duch_kazatel> you need to look at the ajax event, not the form submit.
[18:33:47] <hye> on jquery mobile $.mobile.page.prototype.options.keepNative ="*";  works for me to keep everything native... but how can I keep everything native except checkboxes?
[18:35:30] <BillCriswell> hye: *:not([type=checkbox] maybe?
[18:35:46] <hye> let me try bill
[18:36:06] <hye> didnt do it bill
[18:36:31] <BillCriswell> I guess it's not a selector.
[18:37:00] <hye> ya i was hoping for it to be, but its not
[18:37:28] <hye> its just that jquery mobile is messing with some html element, i dont know which one it is that breaks my long js code... but i do * everything works
[18:38:11] <BillCriswell> I have no idea.
[18:41:14] <hye> BillCriswell
[18:41:22] <hye> when i do this:  $.mobile.page.prototype.options.keepNative = "*";
[18:41:23] <hye> it all works
[18:41:26] <hye> but when i do:  $.mobile.page.prototype.options.keepNative = "input[type=text],input[type=radio],a";
[18:41:28] <hye> my js breaks
[18:41:36] <hye> any idea what other input elements i am missing
[18:42:46] <BillCriswell> hye: I have no idea what that variable should be.
[18:44:08] <horsik> guys I was thinking about this for a while..
[18:44:35] <horsik> lets say you have a method with few function calls inside
[18:44:58] <horsik> drink(); eat(); sleep();
[18:45:52] <horsik> inside eat you are doing something with events and you want to wait for these events to happen
[18:45:52] <BillCriswell> hye: How about :input:not(:checkbox)
[18:46:46] <horsik> but you also want to continue execution after eat()
[18:47:38] <horsik> is it even possible without using cpu consuming empty loop?
[18:52:18] <hye> BillCriswell selectors not working in that parameter

[18:54:31] <fireboot_> hi everybody
[18:56:29] <fireboot_> I have a question:
[18:56:33] <fireboot_> I have the following code
[18:56:42] <fireboot_> http://pastebin.com/Z1HAnqeh
[18:56:56] <fireboot_> the idea is that I'm trying to implement a kind of drag&drop
[18:57:16] <Ernston> hi can anyone help, am trying to load the json data, but am doing something wrong whilst trying to get my code working in jsfiddle
[18:57:18] <Ernston> on('pageinit', function() {
[18:57:18] <Ernston>                 $.each(json
[18:57:21] <fireboot_> when an icon is hovered, the mouse will be down and I want to catch when the mouse is released
[18:57:22] <Ernston> shitoops
[18:57:51] <fireboot_> but it seems that in my code, the mouseup handler is called only if the element is still hovered when I release the mouse
[18:57:56] <Ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/4/
[18:58:07] <Ernston> thx
[18:58:08] <fireboot_> any idea why?
[19:02:57] <vidalstat> ls
[19:04:32] <BillCriswell> Ernston: http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/6/
[19:05:18] <BillCriswell> If you look at the console it's just an error.
[19:05:35] <Ernston> thx, let me see
[19:06:41] <Ernston> method tsort?
[19:07:17] <BillCriswell> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ]
[19:07:46] <BillCriswell> Oh, the new errors.
[19:08:08] <BillCriswell> Well, you just don't have the table sorter on jsbin.
[19:08:27] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/4/ This is your initial paste, it has the syntax error
[19:08:54] <Ernston> i was looking at 5, 1sec
[19:09:26] <Ernston> arr i see now
[19:09:59] <Ernston> i just added the }
[19:10:18] <Ernston> i still have a error
[19:11:17] <BillCriswell> The tsort one? It's because you don't have that plugin loaded on jsfiddle ( for starters )
[19:11:24] <Ernston> no its
[19:11:35] <Ernston> property 'scrollto'
[19:12:00] <Ernston> Property 'scrollTo' of object [object global] is not a function
[19:12:33] <Ernston> i have disabled the line requiring tsort also
[19:12:44] <BillCriswell> Ernston: scrollTo isn't loaded then. That's also a plugin.
[19:14:59] <Ernston> how can i load this ? :S
[19:15:26] <BillCriswell> <script src="/path/to/scrollTo.js"></script>
[19:15:39] <Ernston> that simple, :s
[19:16:21] <Ernston> just looking at my offline version
[19:16:35] <Ernston> and i searching for 'scroll' and it was not found :s
[19:17:27] <LoneSoldier728> hey
[19:17:27] <Ernston> searching for solution now
[19:17:29] <LoneSoldier728> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18070766/trying-to-do-an-ajax-get-to-return-a-number-queried
[19:17:56] <LoneSoldier728> anyone know the answer to that I am assuming it is a simple answer that I just don't understand - basically the ajax part is confusing me
[19:18:53] <Es0teric> how do you get the parent of an <a> element? i have this $('.pagination a').click(function() {});
[19:19:19] <Ernston> i found the solution
[19:19:25] <Ernston> unreal
[19:19:28] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: $(this).parent() in the callback.
[19:19:35] <Ernston> would you like to know? :p
[19:19:52] <Ernston> you wont believe how simple it was
[19:20:19] <BillCriswell> Ernston: Sure thing.
[19:20:31] <Es0teric> oh wow, BillCriswell thanks... i guess i forgot to add $ to (this)
[19:20:33] <Ernston> i had to enable jquery ui option
[19:20:44] <BillCriswell> Haha, nice.
[19:20:46] <Es0teric> i havent used jquery in awhile so i am rusty
[19:20:53] <Ernston> such a silly mistake :(
[19:20:54] <Es0teric> lol
[19:21:09] <Es0teric> i've been doing more back-end stuff these days rather than front-end
[19:21:26] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: Are you trying to get the result of the ajax request into $('.notifications') ?
[19:23:12] <Es0teric> oh an additional question -- how do you make jquery detect the last <li> and the first <li> ?
[19:23:29] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: $('li').first() and $('li').last()
[19:23:41] <Es0teric> BillCriswell ah i see ok
[19:26:28] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: $.get('/notificationsNumber', { notification: $(this).data('user') }, function (response){ console.log( response ); /* Do things with response */ }) is what I think you want.
[19:28:34] <BillCriswell> If you're looking to populate $('.notifications') with the response of that request, and it's already HTML, you can do $('.notifications').html( response ) in the callback.
[19:28:38] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: ^^
[19:29:35] <Es0teric> BillCriswell so then how do check if a <li> has a specific class without doing a loop?
[19:29:57] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: .is('.foo')
[19:30:07] <BillCriswell> or .hasClass('foo')
[19:31:54] <Es0teric> BillCriswell great i just created a larger problem for myself doing this.. lol
[19:32:05] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Happens.
[19:32:07] <Es0teric> i am using the bootstrap paginator and its being loaded via json
[19:32:29] <Es0teric> well the html of it is being loaded via json so its not really updating like it should when something is clicked
[19:33:56] <Es0teric> i mean i want the paginator but i dont want to lose its functionality
[19:34:30] <LoneSoldier728> I am confused as how to make a correct ajax call
[19:34:45] <LoneSoldier728> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6161540
[19:34:58] <LoneSoldier728> can anyone look at the first file and tell me what I am doing wrong : /
[19:35:03] <Ernston> hi again
[19:35:16] <Ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/16/
[19:35:28] <Ernston> ok now i have it in jsfiddle and working
[19:35:29] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: Scroll up and you should see some code from me.
[19:35:47] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: $.get('/notificationsNumber', { notification: $(this).data('user') }, function (response){ console.log( response ); /* Do things with response */ }) is what I think you want.
[19:35:55] <BillCriswell> If you're looking to populate $('.notifications') with the response of that request, and it's already HTML, you can do $('.notifications').html( response ) in the callback.
[19:36:22] <Ernston> what i am trying to do is sort the list by shoprating and only show the top ten
[19:36:22] <Ernston> am the momement this is working
[19:36:30] <LoneSoldier728> oh thnks just noticed that
[19:36:36] <LoneSoldier728> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6161551
[19:36:40] <LoneSoldier728> I actually updated it to that
[19:37:00] <LoneSoldier728> What I am trying to do is actually talk to node.js
[19:37:10] <LoneSoldier728> and pull the data (a number in this case)
[19:37:22] <LoneSoldier728> and add it to the html text
[19:37:33] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: Look at the code I gave you.
[19:37:34] <LoneSoldier728> of .notifications
[19:37:36] <Ernston> but is it right to display all by rating and then hide all but the first 10 list items ?
[19:37:48] <Ernston> or is there a way to get only the top ten results and show them without having to hide any
[19:39:12] <BillCriswell> Ernston: You can use .slice(0, 10) after you sort it ( I think you're dealing with an array )?
[19:42:38] <LoneSoldier728> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6161584 so like that Bill?
[19:43:22] <LoneSoldier728> something is not working about that tho, because it crashes some parts of the app for me
[19:44:13] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: $('.notifications') not $('notifications')
[19:44:29] <BillCriswell> Assuming it's class="notifications"
[19:44:38] <BillCriswell> If it's an id you want #notifications
[19:44:40] <LoneSoldier728> yeah that is correct
[19:44:49] <LoneSoldier728> the thing is how is it accessing
[19:44:52] <LoneSoldier728> the data queried
[19:44:57] <LoneSoldier728> I have it being returned liek this
[19:45:04] <LoneSoldier728> res.json({notify: user.notifications});
[19:45:12] <LoneSoldier728> is that correct?
[19:45:23] <LoneSoldier728> or should it be this
[19:45:24] <LoneSoldier728> res.json({response: true});
[19:45:36] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: I don't know.
[19:46:44] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[19:46:45] <LoneSoldier728> {notification: $(this).data('user')},
[19:46:50] <LoneSoldier728> i dont think I understand that line tho
[19:46:58] <LoneSoldier728> btw what is the notification pulling
[19:47:03] <LoneSoldier728> and the data
[19:47:04] <LoneSoldier728> actually
[19:47:42] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: That's grabbing the data binded to that element under the key 'user'.
[19:47:46] <Es0teric> BillCriswell is there any way to get a paginator's default behavior if its loaded via json?
[19:47:51] <Es0teric> well twitter bootstrap's paginator
[19:47:59] <Ernston> anyone?
[19:48:08] <Ernston> is slice better than using .hide()
[19:48:37] <BillCriswell> Ernston: .slice(0,10) would just give you the first 10 elements of an array
[19:48:40] <LoneSoldier728> ok then it is incorrect because there is no key user
[19:48:50] <LoneSoldier728> and idk what data is being pulled the html
[19:48:53] <LoneSoldier728> is simply a button
[19:49:02] <LoneSoldier728> nothing else that can be used around it
[19:49:24] <LoneSoldier728> I actually just want to grab the data from my server side code
[19:49:36] <LoneSoldier728> and return it near the button's text
[19:49:44] <LoneSoldier728> would i just delete that line then?
[19:50:00] <BillCriswell> LoneSoldier728: Not following you too well. I actually have to run though.
[19:50:07] <LoneSoldier728> ah kk
[19:50:09] <BillCriswell> Have a good night!
[19:50:10] <LoneSoldier728> thanks for ur help
[19:50:12] <LoneSoldier728> night
[19:50:15] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[19:50:18] <BillCriswell> Take care.
[19:50:25] <Ernston> thx
[19:50:27] <LoneSoldier728> anyone else here who understands ajax?
[19:50:31] <LoneSoldier728> ernston : )
[19:50:46] <LoneSoldier728> ?
[19:51:05] <richcollins> How do I drag an element outside of a vertically scrollable div, across the horizontal border?
[19:51:08] <richcollins> http://jsfiddle.net/ymqMH/2/
[19:54:03] <richcollins> Ah there is an appendTo option
[19:55:42] <richcollins> Ah nope appendTo doesn't work
[19:56:18] <Whirl3d> YOu are gonna have to use droppable
[19:59:04] <LoneSoldier728> hey

[19:59:27] <LoneSoldier728> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6161584
[19:59:32] <LoneSoldier728> anyone
[20:01:33] <Ernston> i am trying to number the first 10 list items by adding html to the <span class="rank">
[20:01:37] <Ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/21/
[20:01:55] <Ernston> if you click top ten page this is where the issue is at
[20:05:01] <Whirl3d> richcollins are you trying to use sortable instead?
[20:05:15] <richcollins> I got it working using helper: "clone"
[20:06:27] <Whirl3d> Ernston, what is pageinit?

[20:08:20] <LoneSoldier728> I know how to work POST but confused about the GET
[20:08:36] <Whirl3d> $('notifications') might not be right
[20:08:44] <LoneSoldier728> it is .notifications
[20:08:47] <LoneSoldier728> i changed it
[20:09:12] <LoneSoldier728> what is not right about it
[20:09:23] <Whirl3d> .notifications is probably fine.
[20:09:39] <LoneSoldier728> without $() you are saying?
[20:10:07] <Whirl3d> $(".notifications") !===$("notifications");   you were missing the .
[20:10:13] <Whirl3d> like you said you corrected
[20:10:20] <LoneSoldier728> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6161692
[20:10:23] <LoneSoldier728> ya look at the new file sorry

[20:17:00] <Whirl3d> $("li").lt(10).each(function (i) {var el=$(this); var h=el.html(); h="<span class='rank'>"+i+"</span"+h; el.html(h);});
[20:17:19] <Whirl3d> ugly but might work.
[20:18:46] <LoneSoldier728> does that js look right whirl3d
[20:18:52] <Ernston> not work :(
[20:18:54] <LoneSoldier728> do u understand node?
[20:19:03] <Whirl3d> LoneSoldier728, I feel like you are handing me a broken puzzle piece in a MUCH bigger puzzle and freaking out that you can't figure out where it goes. You are going to have to make a testcase in jsfiddle or jsbin...
[20:19:21] <Whirl3d> well, not freakin' out. I was speaking in hyperbole
[20:19:44] <LoneSoldier728> lol its ok, ya no I am just confused as how to pass the data back from the server side
[20:19:46] <LoneSoldier728> thats all
[20:19:56] <Whirl3d> Ernston, do you see what I did, though? and give me more info than "Not work"
[20:19:58] <LoneSoldier728> because in this code here https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6161724
[20:20:09] <LoneSoldier728> I am querying the data and returning it to the variable notify
[20:21:33] <Whirl3d> LoneSoldier728, why are you sending an ajax request to a javascript document?
[20:22:01] <Ernston> sorry am just trying to make it not output odd numbers only
[20:22:33] <LoneSoldier728> ok let me explain it better sorry, because I just realized that the /notificationsNumber is not actually running my route file
[20:22:58] <Whirl3d> It's funny. Ernston, you have a ton of code to read through, but LoneSoldier is only giving tiny pieces. Both are hard to troubleshoot. LOL
[20:23:22] <LoneSoldier728> Basically I am trying to create a button that show's any new notifications. I have it being queried correctly on the server side but I am trying to call the file from the clientside
[20:23:42] <Es0teric> has anyone here used twitter bootstrap pagination?
[20:23:42] <LoneSoldier728> and show the data that is being given by the server side (which is a number of notifications)
[20:24:23] <Ernston> sorry its really late
[20:24:29] <Ernston> i think the issue is the selector
[20:24:40] <Ernston>          $('#topten .toptenlist li:eq(0)').children('span.rank').html('1');
[20:24:44] <Whirl3d> LoneSoldier728, but the js document you are ajaxing is not running on the server is it?
[20:26:49] <LoneSoldier728> I have the file running on the server side
[20:27:11] <LoneSoldier728> but I need to somehow call a get to tell the code on it to run
[20:27:30] <Whirl3d> $("#topten .toptenlist li").eq(0) selects the first li element in toptenlist
[20:27:49] <Ernston> so (1) should select the second and so on right?
[20:28:09] <Whirl3d> .eq (n) selects the nth element of the list
[20:28:30] <Whirl3d> is toptenlist a UL?
[20:28:33] <Ernston> i am trying to select the first then change the <span class="rank"></span> html
[20:28:37] <Ernston> yeah
[20:28:47] <Ernston> i was going to use ol
[20:29:22] <Whirl3d> $(".toptenlist li").lt(10).each(function (i) {  //change stuff here});
[20:30:00] <Whirl3d> That selects al li elements 0-9 and tell each of them to do something.
[20:30:11] <Ernston> my example
[20:30:23] <RonWhoCares> whirl3rd  hello
[20:30:28] <Ernston> shows that i cant actually select the even rows
[20:30:33] <RonWhoCares> whirl3d  hello
[20:30:34] <Ernston> am doing something wrong
[20:30:46] <Ernston> http://jsfiddle.net/FjQXy/23/
[20:30:51] <Ernston> 1 3 5 7 9
[20:31:17] <Ernston> what am i doing wrong with that
[20:31:21] <Whirl3d> Where is that data coming from...gimme a second to look
[20:31:28] <Ernston> json at the top
[20:31:38] <Ernston> scroll to bottom or search:
[20:31:51] <Es0teric> ok so i have a ajax search form that grabs json data from a url, but i also have twitter bootstrap paginator as the html for a val in one of the arrays... when i output the html, the paginator works but appends ?page=x to the url making the content disappear
[20:32:01] <Ernston> 		$('#topten .toptenlist').children('li:gt(9)').hide();
[20:32:27] <Ernston> below that line is where am trying to select the first ten li's
[20:32:34] <Es0teric> so i want to click on a page in the paginator and load the content via ajax without losing the paginator's functionality... how do i do that/
[20:32:38] <Ernston> one by one for testing reasons
[20:33:11] <Whirl3d> Ernston, keep in mind that every time you do $(anyting) it sucks up some memory and time. It's best to cache that search in a variable and use the variable.
[20:33:44] <Whirl3d> var listItems=$("#topten .toptenlist li");
[20:34:04] <Whirl3d> listItems.gt(9).hide();
[20:34:37] <Ernston> i noticed in the html
[20:34:46] <Ernston> i have a nested ul
[20:34:53] <Ernston> is this causing the issue
[20:35:11] <Blacklite> is this the right place to ask for help with jquery UI?
[20:35:46] <Ernston> i think so
[20:36:24] <Whirl3d> listItems.lt(10).each(function (i) {var el=$(this); var rank=el.find(".rank"); rank.text(i);});
[20:36:38] <tomivs> I need help
[20:37:25] <tomivs> I want to do something like this: http://www.anidocs.es/bootstrap/docs/components.php
[20:37:36] <Whirl3d> from the list items select the first 10 and apply this function to each of them:::find my ".rank" span and change the text in it to the appropriate number;
[20:37:53] <tomivs> .subnav
[20:38:02] <Whirl3d> Hey RonWhoCares. Sorry, I was in the middle of something.
[20:38:14] <tomivs> I want a fixed navigation menu
[20:38:25] <Ernston> shit i cant get the first part working you shown me
[20:38:31] <RonWhoCares> Whirl3d: I realize this now.  When you are done would you consider helping me, I don't mind waiting.
[20:40:14] <marg0> i have somewhat of an open-ended question question.. how do you guys play around with javascript/css/dom/jquery? What's your "go to" testbed approach?
[20:41:10] <Es0teric> ok so i have a ajax search form that grabs json data from a url, but i also have twitter bootstrap paginator as the html for a val in one of the arrays... when i output the html, the paginator works but appends ?page=x to the url making the content disappear  so i want to click on a page in the paginator and load the content via ajax without losing the paginator's functionality... how do i do that/
[20:42:22] <Ernston> thx
[20:43:10] <Ernston> the li starts at 0 :(
[20:43:18] <Ernston> how can i make the .rank 1 not 0
[20:49:07] <Whirl3d> Ernston, I have no clue whatsoever. I mean, really it is nearly impossible to tell when you are dynamically creating all of these elements from JSON data. I am sure someone can help, but I would have to start from the very beginning
[20:49:29] <Ernston> np
[20:49:39] <Ernston> its late i should tackle this fresh tomorrow
[20:49:49] <Ernston> thx for help so far its almost working:)
[20:50:19] <Whirl3d> what is tstort?
[20:50:24] <Whirl3d> tsort?
[20:51:10] <Ernston> tinysort
[20:51:20] <Ernston> plugin
[20:51:28] <Ernston> sorry but i must goto bed its 4;51am
[20:51:36] <Ernston> back later

[21:22:57] <abjorn> probably not the place to ask that llckfan
[21:23:13] <imsky> abjorn, i've been learning python along the way too
[21:23:19] <abjorn> nice
[21:23:19] <imsky> it's got its ups and downs
[21:23:29] <imsky> i'm very uneasy about its import system
[21:23:56] <imsky> apparently you can just specify a ton of PATH variables so you can put crap wherever you want really
[21:23:59] <abjorn> yeeeaaah im not a hug efan
[21:24:04] <LLckfan> there is no place to ask
[21:24:07] <imsky> also i gotta learn how to create .egg files
[21:24:12] <abjorn> this is the internet, yes ther eis llckdan
[21:24:14] <imsky> seems like a valuable skill
[21:24:17] <abjorn> llckfan, even
[21:24:20] <imsky> LLckfan, how about stackoverflow
[21:24:24] <imsky> or superuser
[21:24:27] <imsky> or ur mom
[21:24:32] <abjorn> or your isp because that sounds like an isp problem
[21:24:47] <imsky> "hello my blu ray player *click* hello?"
[21:24:49] <abjorn> or im *sure* there's an irc channel for that sort of thing
[21:25:02] <LLckfan> not a isp problem
[21:25:12] <imsky> well it sure as shit isn't a javascript problem
[21:25:15] <LLckfan> As I am online with the router and wireless
[21:25:16] <imsky> you heathen
[21:25:17] <abjorn> tru nuff
[21:25:25] <abjorn> least of all a jquery issue
[21:25:43] <abjorn> bam
[21:25:49] <imsky> just dumping on the guy
[21:26:10] <imsky> i watched all seasons of shark tank recently
[21:26:13] <imsky> like...8 hours ago
[21:26:31] <imsky> feeling like telling people their idea is worthless now
[21:27:37] <LoneSoldier728> why is there no
[21:27:43] <LoneSoldier728> jquery questions
[21:27:49] <LoneSoldier728> of how to do an ajax get
[21:28:01] <LoneSoldier728> anyone here notice a problem with this code?
[21:28:06] <LoneSoldier728> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6161692
[21:28:41] <imsky> it uses...alerts
[21:29:03] <LoneSoldier728> well the problem I have
[21:29:07] <LoneSoldier728> is that the notify
[21:29:12] <LoneSoldier728> is not being called correctly
[21:29:16] <LoneSoldier728> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6161724
[21:29:20] <LoneSoldier728> that is the server side file
[21:30:12] <imsky> yeah who knows whats going on
[21:30:28] <imsky> i'll fix your code for a reasonable fee
[21:30:40] <imsky> because now it looks like a problem that a gist can't solve
[21:31:01] <LoneSoldier728> kk some hugs and kisses work
[21:31:05] <LoneSoldier728> do you know node.js?
[21:31:18] <LoneSoldier728> or how data has to be sent
[21:31:29] <imsky> what
[21:31:30] <LoneSoldier728> to be received by an ajax get
[21:31:55] <imsky> ok why don't you explain how your mechanism works
[21:32:12] <LoneSoldier728> ok
[21:33:07] <regedit> after $(something).keydown() how do i make the event continue its default handling?
[21:33:14] <LoneSoldier728> Basically I am trying to notify users if they have new notifications by adding the number to the notifications button. The way I am doing it is I am querying my server side code and returning the value to a variable called notify.
[21:33:38] <LoneSoldier728> Now I am trying to use ajax.get to get the variable from the server side and display it on the client side
[21:33:56] <LoneSoldier728> the problem is, that it is not getting the variable for some reason
[21:34:05] <imsky> so you have node.js set up and you're not using socket.io?
[21:34:21] <LoneSoldier728> right because I dont care about it being real time
[21:34:49] <imsky> then i have to question the node.js decision
[21:35:13] <LoneSoldier728> the thing is I might go back and change it but I want to be able to do an ajax get regardless
[21:35:22] <Neillithan> can somebody tell me why this doesn't work? http://pastebin.com/syqKiDUU
[21:35:23] <LoneSoldier728> because I understand how the post works
[21:35:35] <imsky> have you tried just doing a GET in your browser?
[21:35:52] <LoneSoldier728> through console u mean?
[21:36:43] <imsky> uhh no through the address bar
[21:37:15] <LoneSoldier728> um ya but it displays nothing on the page?
[21:37:36] <imsky> yeah good job einstein
[21:37:55] <LoneSoldier728> lol?
[21:38:41] <imsky> if you're not seeing anything, why are you expecting your ajax to work
[21:39:31] <Neillithan> does anyone see anything inherently incorrect about my pastebin?
[21:39:35] <LoneSoldier728> ok that makes sense but
[21:39:43] <LoneSoldier728> it is console.log -ing
[21:39:45] <LoneSoldier728> everything
[21:40:40] <imsky> ok you're gonna have to explain that
[21:41:12] <LoneSoldier728> thanks a bunch
[21:41:19] <LoneSoldier728> i had to do
[21:41:20] <LoneSoldier728> res.json
[21:41:24] <LoneSoldier728> instead of res.send
[21:41:35] <imsky> life is easy when you're rolling with json
[21:42:28] <LoneSoldier728> quick question too
[21:42:35] <LoneSoldier728> can I change the css of just the notify part
[21:43:20] <imsky> probably
[21:43:20] <Neillithan> lika sum BOOOOOOOOOOO dee I need someone to HALP me
[21:44:09] <LoneSoldier728> I tried before calling this line
[21:44:14] <LoneSoldier728> $('.notifications').html("Notifications " + notify)
[21:44:33] <LoneSoldier728> to do var notify = notify.css("color", "red")
[21:44:47] <imsky> son, just use a stylesheet
[21:45:40] <LoneSoldier728> ok, was seeing if I can just serve it jquery style
[21:45:53] <LrdArc> http://codepad.org/DRH7knCh <- is there a way to merge both selector??
[21:46:16] <LoneSoldier728> xoxoxo imsky
[21:46:20] <LoneSoldier728> had to repay u
[21:46:51] <abjorn> LrdArc: $('#select,#reload'), though if you're attaching different event handlers I wouldn't see why
[21:47:21] <imsky> yw LoneSoldier728
[21:48:11] <LrdArc> abjorn: but it's has different function, as one for .on('change' and the other for .click(function()
[21:48:43] <abjorn> then why would you want to combine them
[21:49:40] <LrdArc> since the code inside these function is the same i think it's a bit redundant
[21:52:15] <abjorn> then make it a named function and attach to each event, lrdarc
[21:54:20] <LrdArc> err you right. never thought before.
[21:54:23] <peepsalot> i want to replace an arbitrary image with a canvas, and keep all the same positioning, border, margin, etc attributes.  any ideas on the simplest way to apply these from image to canvas element?
[22:36:57] <imsky> peepsalot, yes
[22:37:16] <regedit> why doesn't .get(index) seem to return an extended element?
[22:37:32] <regedit> i can't do .get(index).someJqueryFunc()
[22:38:52] <imsky> because it does this "Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object."
[22:39:38] <regedit> imsky: what's the right function to use then
[22:39:51] <regedit> to get an element and be able to call jquery funcs on it
[22:40:03] <regedit> or must i do the fugly $($())
[22:40:09] <abjorn> $('selector')
[22:40:40] <abjorn> i would like to suggest this http://jqfundamentals.com/
[22:41:13] <regedit> ewwww
[22:41:16] <abjorn> if you mean that you want a particular index in a set of elements
[22:41:20] <regedit> $($(table).prop('rows').get(index))
[22:41:26] <abjorn> uh
[22:41:27] <abjorn> no?
[22:41:31] <abjorn> why would you do that
[22:41:33] <abjorn> no
[22:41:40] <regedit> so i can call further jquery on the row
[22:41:40] <abjorn> if you want an index in a set of elements
[22:41:45] <abjorn> .eq(index)
[22:42:00] <abjorn> i misunderstood your question, my bad
[22:42:20] <regedit> aha! that should do it. thanks!
[22:43:02] <abjorn> you should only need the $() function to select an element by selector or wrap a native DOM element in jquery
[22:43:19] <regedit> ok
[22:43:22] <imsky> damn its late
[22:43:25] <imsky> im out
[22:43:27] <imsky> late abjorn
[22:43:49] <peepsalot> imsky, ??
[22:43:59] <abjorn> later imsky
[22:44:05] <peepsalot> wtf
[22:44:31] <peepsalot> replies yes to my question, no explanation
[22:44:52] <abjorn> i would guess he forgot
[23:03:09] <regedit> how can i do $(table).prop('rows').each() ? Uncaught TypeError: Object #<HTMLCollection> has no method 'each'
[23:03:40] <innociv> Erm
[23:03:49] <innociv> table has a prop rows?
[23:04:00] <innociv> .each() is a function that's on an array of jquery objects
[23:04:17] <innociv> if prop('rows') doesn't return an array of jquery objects, then it won't work
[23:04:52] <regedit> i have a var that is a jquery-extended <table>
[23:05:05] <peepsalot> why is .offset a getter and setter but .position  is not?
[23:05:12] <regedit> how do i select all its rows as array of jquery-extended so i can do .each
[23:05:53] <innociv> erm...
[23:05:57] <innociv> so what is prop('rows')?
[23:06:16] <regedit> innociv: DOM <table> has a property 'rows'
[23:06:26] <regedit> it's a collection of all the table rows
[23:06:35] <regedit> as a regular javascript array, i guess
[23:06:39] <innociv> Erm so it's your own array?  That's probably why.
[23:06:42] <innociv> do forEach on it
[23:06:53] <regedit> it's DOM
[23:07:10] <regedit> forget that - just how do i select further down a var
[23:07:24] <regedit> var table = $(selector);
[23:07:41] <regedit> in prototype i do table.select('tr')
[23:07:52] <regedit> what's the jquery equivalent
[23:08:05] <regedit> pretty please
[23:09:14] <systemfault> Sorry?
[23:09:39] <regedit> var table = $(some_selector);
[23:09:43] <regedit> so far so good?
[23:10:04] <systemfault> Yeah
[23:10:17] <regedit> now get all it's TRs please, in jquery
[23:10:23] <regedit> in a way that i can do .each
[23:10:26] <regedit> on them all
[23:10:33] <systemfault> table.find('tr').each(......
[23:10:45] <regedit> aha! so they call it find()
[23:10:47] <regedit> interesting
[23:10:48] <systemfault> .prop is to access a DOM property of a nice
[23:10:48] <regedit> thanks!
[23:10:59] <systemfault> Like.. a method/member variable
[23:11:09] <regedit> i see
[23:13:21] <bayleaf> how would i select the div with the class (and only it) of 'one' with this markup? http://jsfiddle.net/SRVP5/
[23:15:04] <regedit> ARGH operator precedence / associativity got me this time
[23:15:52] <regedit> table.find('tr').length; // 2
[23:16:02] <regedit> if( !table.find('tr').length>2 ) // false!
[23:16:14] <regedit> if( !(table.find('tr').length>2) ) // true
[23:16:17] <regedit> wtf
[23:20:18] <Cork> regedit: heh nice one
[23:20:56] <Cork> but ya, -1 is smaller then 2 :)
[23:21:15] <Cork> oh, wait sorry it's 0 >_<
[23:21:21] <regedit> -1 ? 0 ?
[23:21:27] <regedit> whadyou mean, it's 2
[23:21:39] <Cork> !2 > 2
[23:21:44] <Cork> (!2) > 2 <--
[23:21:56] <Cork> as in (not 2) > 2
[23:22:07] <Cork> and that makes 2 falsy
[23:22:24] <regedit> i see now
[23:22:44] <regedit> pray for all the noobs who dont pay attention to this...
[23:22:46] <Cork> so what you do is (!2) > 2 == 0 > 2
[23:23:13] <Cork> or rather (!2) > 2 == false > 2 == 0 > 2
[23:24:30] <regedit> why do i have the impression that other languages i deal with (java for example) do what i mean in this case (not necessarily what i coded :P)
[23:29:19] <tw2113> how's Cork
[23:29:51] <Cork> regedit: no, that is how falsy works
[23:30:09] <Cork> tw2113: fine, back form vacation
[23:30:19] <tw2113> cool
[23:30:20] <regedit> Cork: you're saying this is mostly javascript-only behavior?
[23:30:26] <Cork> regedit: you would get the same effect in php, java, c, c++
[23:30:34] <regedit> hm
[23:30:39] <Cork> in ruby you would get a parser error
[23:30:47] <Cork> cause you can't compare two different classes
[23:31:04] <Cork> (numbers and false/true isn't matchable in ruby :D )
[23:42:38] <Neillithan> Can somebody tell me what I'm doing wrong here?  http://jsfiddle.net/wDhAm/
[23:43:19] <Neillithan> I'm trying to replace the "item" with the message "Found the thing" if there's a div.thing inside.  otherwise, replace the item with the message "Didn't find the thing".
[23:49:07] <tw2113> Neillithan, looks like you're not targeting the inner div to change the text
[23:50:18] <TeddyMurray> how do i get the length of an object? for instance:
[23:50:19] <TeddyMurray> Object {1: Array[2], 2: Array[3]}
[23:50:19] <TeddyMurray> oApplicant = $.parseJSON(jApplicant); var app_length = oApplicant.length; console.debug(oApplicant);
[23:50:30] <TeddyMurray> app_length is undefined
[23:50:50] <Neillithan> tw2113: What abuot now? http://jsfiddle.net/wDhAm/1/
[23:51:10] <tw2113> i see the first box being empty now
[23:51:16] <tw2113> and the 2nd one having "Found the thing"
[23:51:23] <Neillithan> right
[23:51:30] <Neillithan> but the first box is supposed to say "didn't find the thing"
[23:51:40] <tw2113> well you're essentially selecting itself again
[23:51:53] <tw2113> unless the div.thing div is supposed to be removed completely
[23:52:00] <tw2113> i assume you want just the text changed
[23:52:28] <Cork> TeddyMurray: objects doesn't have lengths
[23:52:41] <Neillithan> tw2113: The else is supposed to target all div.item that do not have a div.thing and put the message "Didn't find the thing" inside
[23:53:11] <Cork> TeddyMurray: reconstruct your json to use arrays instead and it should work fine
[23:53:21] <TeddyMurray> good idea
[23:53:22] <TeddyMurray> thanks
[23:53:38] <Bioblaze> $('#landing').click(function() { if ($(this).not('disabled')) {  $(this).addClass('disabled'); } }); }); <--- Can anyway See anything wrong with that? Ive tried several time but, I cant seem to get it to change the class on the Website @.@
[23:54:08] <Cork> Bioblaze: you'r missing a dot in the not selector
[23:54:30] <Bioblaze> ??
[23:54:35] <Bioblaze> o.o .disabled?
[23:54:40] <Cork> yes
[23:54:50] <Cork> not matches selectors, not just classes
[23:55:03] <Neillithan> tw2113: did that make sense?
[23:55:09] <tw2113> Neillithan, http://jsfiddle.net/wDhAm/2/
[23:55:28] <Bioblaze> ok fixed that thank you Cork, but I`m still having the problem of nothing triggering.
[23:55:52] <tw2113> forgot to delete one of my console.log() calls
[23:55:53] <mitchdotpro> Does anyone know if there is a plugin / library that exists to create a map with heat points similar to this graphic? http://i.imgur.com/TiLf17g.jpg
[23:55:57] <Bioblaze> Ive changed the $('#landing') part to $('a') to see if I can get it to trigger correctly.
[23:55:57] <Cork> Bioblaze: is the #landing constant in the page?
[23:56:09] <Neillithan> tw2113: oh okay I was wondering
[23:56:12] <Bioblaze> yessir. <a id="landing" href="#" class="btn btn-default">Landing Page</a>
[23:56:26] <TeddyMurray> Bioblaze, is it within $(document).ready(function() { });?
[23:56:37] <Bioblaze> yes is there a paste area?
[23:56:45] <Bioblaze> Or can I post a Link?
[23:56:48] <TeddyMurray> go ahead
[23:56:52] <Bioblaze> wolfpack-manor.net/~NCS/
[23:57:04] <Neillithan> tw2113: what does the .length>0 do?
[23:57:13] <Cork> Bioblaze: try $(document).on('click', '#landing', function() { $(this).toggleClass('disabled'); });
[23:57:14] <tw2113> check for a length greater than 0
[23:57:15] <TeddyMurray> Uncaught ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[23:57:16] <Bioblaze> http://wolfpack-manor.net/~NCS/js/Custom.js
[23:57:38] <tw2113> probably by design, the .children() was returning something regardless
[23:57:45] <tw2113> but with a length of 0
[23:57:56] <Bioblaze> No nothing I am afraid.
[23:57:57] <tw2113> so it was always checking as true
[23:58:03] <tw2113> thus you never got to your else
[23:58:13] <Neillithan> hmm interesting.  that's way over my head but it works lol
[23:58:25] <tw2113> it'll come to you in time
[23:58:34] <Cork> Bioblaze: and if you add a console.log or alert in the handler does it trigger?
[23:58:47] <Neillithan> thanks for helping me solve this.  this will enable me to pull off something more complicated now :-)
[23:58:56] <Bioblaze> how would I put that Cork? And where?
[23:59:10] <Cork> Bioblaze: anywhere in the function in there ya
[23:59:37] <Bioblaze> hmm
