[02:18:18] <devi8> inside $.fn.custom=function () {    this is the jquery object itself,, right? no need for $(this)
[02:18:50] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to find out :)
[02:19:05] <devi8> I keep trying. It gets confusing
[02:19:45] <sumyunseal> lel
[02:19:59] <sumyunseal> javascript is very confusing
[02:20:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/qrp1odgj/
[02:20:36] <devi8> so this is the dom element
[02:20:50] <devi8> $.foo=function () { this is where this is the jquery object
[02:20:50] <robertmaxrees> you sure about that?
[02:20:53] <devi8> no
[02:21:30] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/qrp1odgj/1/
[02:21:32] <robertmaxrees> even better
[02:22:09] <robertmaxrees> or https://jsfiddle.net/qrp1odgj/2/
[02:24:27] <devi8> Here is what I am trying to do. I want to be able to align any object by a custom reference point on each object. So for example, align the top left corner of item a to the bottom right corner of item b.
[02:25:01] <devi8> I'm crazy close, but I'm sure you are going to make fun of my code, but here it goes: https://jsfiddle.net/1xcs0ysz/15/
[02:25:54] <robertmaxrees> so backing up.
[02:25:55] <robertmaxrees> why?
[02:26:08] <devi8> why what?
[02:26:21] <robertmaxrees> why do you want to align those elements like that?
[02:26:45] <robertmaxrees> also: you're conflating functons on $.fn with normal functions.
[02:27:52] <devi8> this is about the 40th version. Several other versions I tried to be more careful. This time I figured I'd just make it work, then clean it up
[02:28:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[02:28:18] <robertmaxrees> so where are you getting lost?
[02:28:33] <devi8> and I am so close. I just can't get the $.fn.aligment()  method to return the assigned alingment
[02:28:48] <devi8> line 100
[02:29:30] <robertmaxrees> first off
[02:29:37] <robertmaxrees> you're doing a lot of this.foo = 'blah'
[02:30:07] <robertmaxrees> are you expecting those to be new objects?
[02:30:08] <devi8> I know. At first I extended objects and all that. This time I was just trying to trudge through it
[02:30:16] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[02:30:39] <devi8> if I call them with new  I thought that made them new
[02:31:05] <robertmaxrees> you should check out https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects
[02:31:18] <devi8> I could probably quote every line to you
[02:31:19] <robertmaxrees> especially https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects#Creating_new_objects
[02:31:30] <devi8> It's permanently open in my browser on it's own monitor
[02:31:55] <robertmaxrees> so then where's the confusion?
[02:32:13] <robertmaxrees> actually
[02:32:18] <robertmaxrees> lemme rephrase all of this.
[02:32:22] <devi8> that's how I was able to finally get the xfunc and yfunc to accept alignment methods that would take a target
[02:32:45] <robertmaxrees> you want $.fn.alignment to return a new alignTool instance, right?
[02:32:56] <devi8> yes
[02:33:01] <robertmaxrees> so.
[02:33:04] <devi8> if parameters are passed
[02:33:11] <devi8> if not, I want the already defined instance
[02:33:20] <robertmaxrees> what var do you return out of that method?
[02:33:39] <robertmaxrees> (this is relevant, I promise)
[02:33:58] <devi8> the alignment method (which is the alignTool instance)
[02:34:27] <robertmaxrees> so wait.
[02:34:34] <robertmaxrees> in which instance is this NOT working correctly.
[02:34:55] <robertmaxrees> you're jumping too far ahead.
[02:35:07] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/1xcs0ysz/16/ with some alignment added.
[02:35:14] <robertmaxrees> ^ look at lines 107 and 109.
[02:35:16] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[02:35:16] <devi8> When you run the fiddle, click on source...it trys to align itself with isself---which works--nothing happens
[02:35:21] <robertmaxrees> stop.
[02:35:22] <robertmaxrees> :)_
[02:35:30] <robertmaxrees> look at that last fiddle.
[02:35:34] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[02:35:39] <sumyunseal> fiddle me this
[02:36:02] <devi8> OMG  I missed one NEW
[02:36:05] <devi8> I could scream
[02:36:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[02:36:09] <robertmaxrees> so
[02:36:10] <devi8> You are my hero
[02:36:19] <robertmaxrees> what's the lesson?
[02:36:27] <robertmaxrees> We're all always wrong and missing simple things.
[02:36:40] <robertmaxrees> (i do it too and i'm in charge of people, don't worry)
[02:36:44] <devi8> I am always wrong and so grateful this was a simple thing.
[02:36:53] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[02:36:55] <devi8> thank you so much
[02:36:56] <robertmaxrees> hella
[02:37:58] <devi8> YEAH! it is amazingly close. just a little tweaking necessary...then I can refactor and do it right
[02:38:03] <robertmaxrees> :)
[02:41:49] <sumyunseal> meth?
[02:42:51] <robertmaxrees> hurr
[02:42:52] <sumyunseal> devi8, why u not make classes?
[02:43:10] <robertmaxrees> sumyunseal because classes in JS are just syntactic sugar.
[02:43:22] <sumyunseal> ya but that looks weird
[02:43:29] <sumyunseal> he needs to put
[02:43:30] <robertmaxrees> it looks like...
[02:43:32] <robertmaxrees> ...javascript.
[02:43:37] <robertmaxrees> also: classes are weird.
[02:43:43] <sumyunseal> blah: function()
[02:43:57] <robertmaxrees> nah
[02:44:00] <sumyunseal> ya
[02:44:02] <sumyunseal> comon
[02:44:11] <robertmaxrees> nah
[02:44:21] <sumyunseal> blah: function(), bleh: {},
[02:44:22] <robertmaxrees> pure functions - calculate and put stuff where it needs to be.
[02:44:31] <robertmaxrees> or use react/riot/literally anything to do this.
[02:44:31] <sumyunseal> blah: function(), bleh: {}, b2: [],
[02:44:55] <sumyunseal> no u dont want them hang outside
[02:45:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:45:26] <robertmaxrees> you want to have data that represents state and then functions to render that out.
[02:45:27] <robertmaxrees> boom done.
[02:45:42] <sumyunseal> i duno
[02:45:59] <sumyunseal> wat if u want to use it like a dependancy
[02:46:11] <robertmaxrees> then you're building frontends wrong.
[02:46:13] <sumyunseal> or like inherit multiple ones
[02:46:21] <sumyunseal> hahaha
[02:46:27] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[02:46:41] <sumyunseal> my c++ inherits 4 classes
[02:46:54] <robertmaxrees> that's nice.
[02:46:58] <robertmaxrees> luckily this isn't c++
[02:46:58] <sumyunseal> yeah
[02:47:16] <robertmaxrees> since it's JS.
[02:47:20] <robertmaxrees> and does what it does well.
[02:47:34] <sumyunseal> my game's player class
[02:47:47] <robertmaxrees> back up
[02:47:51] <robertmaxrees> web ui vs games.
[02:47:55] <sumyunseal> it uses model, animator, renderer
[02:47:56] <robertmaxrees> different concepts entirely
[02:48:04] <sumyunseal> see
[02:48:17] <sumyunseal> and each of those 3 use structs and other crap
[02:48:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah, no
[02:48:27] <sumyunseal> like a shitload of shit
[02:48:39] <robertmaxrees> we're talking web ui like sane people in here
[02:48:42] <robertmaxrees> :)
[02:48:49] <sumyunseal> ya but
[02:48:56] <sumyunseal> web can get pretty hairy
[02:48:58] <robertmaxrees> context is important.
[02:49:01] <robertmaxrees> lolol
[02:49:12] <robertmaxrees> web isn't hard for the reasons people think it is.
[02:49:35] <sumyunseal> ...?
[02:49:57] <robertmaxrees> why do you think "web can get pretty hairy"?
[02:50:59] <sumyunseal> no y u think  web isn't hard for the reasons people think it is.
[02:51:24] <robertmaxrees> i've never heard a valid reason.
[02:51:33] <robertmaxrees> modern webdev makes things easy.
[02:53:02] <sumyunseal> ok
[02:53:03] <sumyunseal> so
[02:53:11] <sumyunseal> modern dev all use that style
[02:53:20] <robertmaxrees> what style?
[02:53:20] <sumyunseal> that i pasted
[02:53:24] <robertmaxrees> newp
[02:53:27] <sumyunseal> yes
[02:53:35] <robertmaxrees> newp
[02:53:45] <robertmaxrees> but hey, what do I know.
[02:53:51] <sumyunseal> which r u refering to
[02:54:01] <robertmaxrees> you're talking about classes.
[02:54:04] <robertmaxrees> in js
[02:54:17] <robertmaxrees> unless you changed subject.
[02:54:22] <sumyunseal> yes clas
[02:54:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, some places do.  luckily we have choices.
[02:55:00] <sumyunseal> react and angular both use that style
[02:55:08] <robertmaxrees> aaaah but wait.
[02:55:15] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts :)
[02:56:05] <sumyunseal> do u like ts
[02:56:10] <robertmaxrees> heck no.
[02:56:15] <sumyunseal> ic
[02:56:24] <robertmaxrees> stylistically react uses classes only because of the syntactic sugar.  also, react is only part of a solution, angular is more encompassing
[02:56:25] <sumyunseal> me2 kinda
[02:56:40] <robertmaxrees> if you don't like js, write in something else.
[02:56:49] <sumyunseal> im on angular1
[02:57:08] <sumyunseal> but i have a angualr2 proto
[02:57:15] <sumyunseal> and i dont like a2
[02:57:18] <robertmaxrees> angularN is bad.
[02:57:36] <sumyunseal> yeah they versioning got out of hand
[02:57:39] <robertmaxrees> though, admittedly, the best java framework for the web i've ever seen.
[02:58:07] <sumyunseal> they better not dorp a1
[02:58:20] <robertmaxrees> you're right.  they just need to drop all of angular.
[02:58:35] <sumyunseal> then i go back to backbone
[02:58:42] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^
[02:58:45] <robertmaxrees> not a bad framework.
[02:58:53] <robertmaxrees> riot is pretty deece, too.
[02:59:16] <sumyunseal> i was able to get pretty neat w backbone
[03:00:15] <sumyunseal> but angular is more fun stuff
[03:00:25] <robertmaxrees> if you like java, sure.
[03:00:37] <sumyunseal> its kind of loose
[03:00:45] <robertmaxrees> and inspired by java.
[03:00:55] <sumyunseal> jaava is ok
[03:01:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah see.
[03:01:04] <robertmaxrees> that's why you like angular
[03:01:14] <sumyunseal> no id rather not use java
[03:01:21] <sumyunseal> but its fine
[03:01:21] <robertmaxrees> but y
[03:01:26] <robertmaxrees> right.
[03:01:30] <sumyunseal> jaava is just gross
[03:01:31] <robertmaxrees> hence my statement :)
[03:01:37] <robertmaxrees> wut
[03:01:47] <sumyunseal> but ppl jus use it
[03:01:50] <sumyunseal> lel
[03:01:55] <sumyunseal> but its so gross
[03:02:07] <robertmaxrees> lol
[03:02:14] <robertmaxrees> java is fine for what it does.
[03:02:22] <robertmaxrees> angular was written by a bunch of java devs at google.
[03:02:25] <sumyunseal> id rather not waste my time
[03:02:31] <robertmaxrees> hence the angular -> java connection.
[03:02:51] <sumyunseal> java is such a huge waste of time
[03:03:11] <robertmaxrees> it really isn't.
[03:03:15] <robertmaxrees> it has its place.
[03:03:36] <sumyunseal> where its place?
[03:04:05] <robertmaxrees> business logic.  backends.  same place C# is appropriate.
[03:04:23] <sumyunseal> naw
[03:04:27] <robertmaxrees> LOL
[03:04:35] <sumyunseal> busines logic lol
[03:04:42] <sumyunseal> thats php world
[03:04:43] <robertmaxrees> it's a Real Thing™
[03:04:45] <robertmaxrees> ew no.
[03:04:47] <robertmaxrees> php nonono
[03:05:16] <sumyunseal> php is best for that
[03:05:25] <robertmaxrees> i'm just
[03:05:32] <robertmaxrees> gonna say we're never going to agree.
[03:05:47] <robertmaxrees> my company has used both PHP and Java for backends.
[03:05:48] <sumyunseal> look at the stats
[03:05:51] <robertmaxrees> i am.
[03:05:59] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating concepts.
[03:06:07] <robertmaxrees> php is popular because it's cheap to find hosting.
[03:06:15] <robertmaxrees> hence its ubiquity.
[03:06:25] <robertmaxrees> in some cases, it's the wrong solution.
[03:06:28] <sumyunseal> java is cheaper
[03:06:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[03:06:43] <sumyunseal> comon lol
[03:06:54] <sumyunseal> ill give u a java server for free
[03:07:07] <robertmaxrees> have you run both environments for major production sites?
[03:07:09] <sumyunseal> it sucks ram
[03:07:13] <robertmaxrees> that do, effectively, the same thing?
[03:07:26] <sumyunseal> yes
[03:07:32] <sumyunseal> java missfires
[03:07:38] <sumyunseal> alot!
[03:07:43] <robertmaxrees> we had the literal opposite experience.
[03:07:45] <sumyunseal> omg
[03:07:52] <sumyunseal> then ur prograaammer
[03:07:54] <sumyunseal> sucks
[03:07:58] <robertmaxrees> *programmers.
[03:08:01] <sumyunseal> and is a huge nerd
[03:08:08] <robertmaxrees> two separate teams with tons of experience.
[03:08:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[03:08:13] <sumyunseal> bs
[03:08:17] <robertmaxrees> 100% truth
[03:08:19] <sumyunseal> those teams suk balls
[03:08:25] <robertmaxrees> woah hey.
[03:08:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[03:08:27] <robertmaxrees> not cool.
[03:08:42] <sumyunseal> here
[03:08:55] <sumyunseal> if i were to do any heavy processing
[03:08:58] <sumyunseal> c++
[03:09:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[03:09:15] <sumyunseal> otherwise php
[03:09:19] <robertmaxrees> neither.
[03:09:23] <sumyunseal> look at the stats
[03:09:25] <robertmaxrees> *for us*
[03:09:36] <sumyunseal> php smokes even python in some things
[03:09:38] <robertmaxrees> you cannot speak for my company's experience.
[03:09:47] <robertmaxrees> and python smokes PHP in other ways.
[03:09:51] <robertmaxrees> it's all relative duder.
[03:10:03] <sumyunseal> and c++ is no match for java
[03:10:26] <robertmaxrees> apples and oranges in that case.
[03:11:05] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, different languages work better in different cases.
[03:11:05] <sumyunseal> thats the problem w javaa
[03:11:11] <sumyunseal> its stuck in between
[03:11:16] <robertmaxrees> it's not though.
[03:11:17] <sumyunseal> and its shittier
[03:11:21] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[03:11:34] <robertmaxrees> we've had a ton of success having out backend written in java.
[03:11:37] <robertmaxrees> *our
[03:11:43] <sumyunseal> i mean sure
[03:11:57] <sumyunseal> i use it
[03:11:59] <robertmaxrees> other places won't have the same success.
[03:13:08] <sumyunseal> there are some libs that u need java for
[03:13:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[04:50:54] <robertmaxrees> what a day.
[10:45:29] <dreadkopp> hey guys, I am stuck in a environment that uses query 1.10.2 ... two questions : is current jQuery 100% backwards compatible ? If not: is there a documentation for 1.10.x ? since a lot methods seems to be missing
[10:55:19] <Lope> how can I run a function when body gets a class?
[11:10:21] <pavonia> Lope: Do you have control over the code that changes the class attribute?
[11:29:33] <Lope> no
[11:29:44] <Lope> If I did, I wouldn't ask this.
[12:18:23] <uskerine> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48599920/jquery-detect-when-two-html-span-contain-same-value
[17:07:28] <forgotmynick> I have a jquery slider that i want incrementing/steps by 10k up until the value is 1 million and then increments by  100k. So far I have https://jsfiddle.net/hnfLne0j/ but once the slider gets above 990k, the next amount becomes 1,010,000, how can i do this?
[17:10:15] <forgotmynick> unless using values [] is the only way
[18:17:08] <robertmaxrees> dreadkopp https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/ few hours late but just in cas you haven't found it :)
[18:18:03] <robertmaxrees> forgotmynick i'm confused.
[18:18:15] <robertmaxrees> could you flesh that fiddle out a bit more or did you figure it out?
[18:39:28] <forgotmynick> robertmaxrees: no i didn't figure it out :( with jquery slider you can specify steps so each slide will increase the value by the step amount. when the slider is loaded, it's set to step 10,000. when the value gets to 1 million, i want the step to change to 100,000 but no matter which way i do it, the value will always become 1,010,000 after 990,000 and i don't understand why
[18:40:55] <robertmaxrees> try to console.log(ui.value) and see what the value actually is.
[19:03:41] <dreadkopp> robertmaxrees thanks :)  looks a bit too much for a quick migration to 3.0 though
