[02:34:41] <rominronin> Lowell: hey, so I tested something with cim
[02:35:34] <rominronin> i'm working with two environments: dev and staging; both synced.
[02:36:34] <rominronin> made some changes to dev, exported them. imported them into staging. As expected, the changes are transferred across (views configuration)
[02:38:18] <rominronin> what's unexpected, and what has thrown me off in the past, is that changes made to a site are shown as standard on the synchronize tab
[02:38:31] <rominronin> with an import all button
[02:39:35] <rominronin> I think this is an aspect of the ui that could be tidied up, since it looks the same on a new environment when you're importing all changes from an exported config file.
[02:40:18] <rominronin> and there is a distinction that should be clearer on the system upon which the changes are initiated/exported.
[03:13:36] <ace_me> I have a piece of code which deselect a radio option but only if the alert is uncommented ! https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4e1f9b628a34ca185c28 Any hint please ?
[03:19:25] <victorius> I get a <select> element with jquery, using .get(0) so I can pass the select element to a function that manipulates with .options. If i call the function on the element with onchange, passing "this". It works. From my jQuery, there's an error cannot read property 'options' of undefined
[03:27:59] <ace_me> you can see the behavior here: http://jsfiddle.net/smcujszs/1/
[03:28:10] <ace_me> uncomment the alert and will work as expected
[03:28:28] <ace_me> I try to make the radio work as a checkbox :)
[04:01:04] <zephyr> hey, is anyone here?
[04:01:56] <zephyrsin> hello?
[05:06:53] <adv_> anyone knows if this 'ux structure' has a name or knows of a lib/plugin that achieves similar effect? http://www.abinitio.com/
[05:20:52] <tomddd> is anyone here experienced with the Slick carousel slider at all?
[05:31:19] <tomddd> my code to detect a centre slide that has an image with a certain class only seems to work on pageload but not when the centre slide changes
[05:32:00] <tomddd> so if the div has "img-1" or any image on pageload it's fine, but changing the slide nothing is detected
[05:34:25] <tomddd> argh its driving me nuts
[05:36:54] <tomddd> ok let's say i want to display div.stuff after detecting img.img-2 in div.thing
[05:37:09] <tomddd> if the div is already defined as div.thing (that includes img.2), div.stuff will show up
[05:37:30] <tomddd> if the div is simply "div" but i rename it in google element editor to "div.thing", nothing happens
[05:37:41] <tomddd> how do i get it to dynamically recognise the class change?
[05:37:51] <tomddd> it only seems to occur on pageload.
[05:44:11] <YamakasY> anyone a clue why the animate does not work on width but does on a static value ? https://jsfiddle.net/htvxme65/2/

[05:49:01] <YamakasY> tomddd: hehe LOL
[05:49:07] <YamakasY> tomddd: put a 1 behind it ;)
[05:49:45] <tomddd> it's ok, im only gonna use this nickname once probably
[05:49:54] <tomddd> maybe change the password just in case....
[05:51:32] <YamakasY> tomddd: nah no you should live in here, eat here, sleep here, shit here
[05:51:39] <YamakasY> don't forget to flush :D
[05:55:45] <iateadonut> what do you call an input box that is named like 'name[]' so that you can submit an array?
[05:56:30] <YamakasY> iateadonut: type ?
[05:56:59] <YamakasY> iateadonut: no just input
[05:59:16] <iateadonut> i'm trying to figure out how i can make a form like <select name='name[]'> ... and also submit through ajax through jquery.
[05:59:28] <iateadonut> problem is that i don't know what to call that so i'm finding it hard to search on google.
[06:02:08] <tomddd> https://jsfiddle.net/hj3n1xr7/13/ <-- this is the issue im having
[06:02:13] <tomddd> as you can see yeah on page load runs fine
[06:02:20] <tomddd> but if i want the SECOND div to be "duh", and update
[06:02:21] <tomddd> nothing happens
[06:02:23] <tomddd> nothing!!!
[06:02:23] <tomddd> !!!
[06:02:46] <tomddd> how do i detect the class changes on update?
[06:05:39] <tomddd> once ive worked this out
[06:05:39] <tomddd> that's it
[06:05:44] <tomddd> i dont need to rack my brains about anything else at all
[06:05:54] <Resourceful> You aren't changing any classes?
[06:06:11] <tomddd> the script i use on the website changes classes when you move the slider
[06:06:25] <tomddd> if you manually change the class and update, it should detect that, no?
[06:06:28] <tomddd> on this jsfiddle im ean
[06:07:32] <tomddd> move "duh" from first div to second div, update - nuttin
[06:07:43] <tomddd> only works on pageload
[06:08:29] <tomddd> might not be explaining this properly, im using the Slick slider on the site at any rate
[06:08:49] <Resourceful> when do you change classes, at what event?
[06:10:16] <Resourceful> you have two options here
[06:10:50] <Resourceful> either use setInterval to check for change in class periodically (not the best option)
[06:11:19] <Resourceful> or execute that js logic in the fiddle whenever the action that changes classes is triggered
[06:11:27] <tomddd> hmm interesting
[06:12:04] <tomddd> cheers, ill look into it
[06:13:09] <YamakasY> anyoine a clue here ? I can log with in a decent way but it doesn't get applied on the animate https://jsfiddle.net/mnznh6vk/3/
[06:15:17] <Resourceful> tomddd, what you are trying to do works only on page load because your code gets executed once and that's it, it finishes and it will never be fired again
[06:16:06] <tomddd> aye you're right, feels so obvious now lol
[06:16:20] <tomddd> i think slick comes with some cmomands where if you do "swipe" then when thats done, run that code
[06:16:44] <Resourceful> yeah, you need some event
[06:20:20] <tomddd> yep it's working now, feel like a right idiot :) thanks so much

[08:11:54] <Wafamde> Hi. I am trying to get some json with jquery ajax. I can get the data if I just enter the url in the browser, but when I try using ajax I get a Access-Control-Allow-Origin error. Any ideas?
[08:23:20] <Resourceful> Wafamde, search Google for CORS. Basically, you can't make ajax requests to other domains unless they allow you to make it
[08:23:42] <Resourceful> Wafamde, what you can do is make the request in the back-end
[08:24:25] <Wafamde> Resourceful, can you hint me in the direction of what the server would have to do? I am trying to get some weather station data from a .net service.
[08:25:39] <Resourceful> you can make a proxy: a back-end script that makes the request with curl or with native functions and returns the json response, then you can use ajax to make a request to your own server
[08:25:58] <Resourceful> (the back-end script that actually makes the request)
[08:39:14] <sendq> how can I troubleshoot jquery loading?

[09:55:03] <mrk> mmm?
[09:55:24] <taplar_busy> https://jsfiddle.net/g9v14dq8/7/
[09:55:40] <taplar_busy> matchers should be quoted to ensure they are treated as literals

[10:45:00] <pmercado> it doesn't fire
[10:53:36] <decx> well that's it tho
[11:29:30] <PHP_Ninja> Good Evening. Any idea why this works: $("selector").attr({"data-toggle":"dialog", "data-target":"#modal"}), and this does not : $("selector").attr({dataToggle:"dialog", dataTarget:"#modal"});
[11:31:23] <ngharo> dunno but you should be using .data() for data attributes, not attr()
[11:36:03] <decx> if we ignore that fact that you should use data() and then those are invalid attributes, there's also the fact that attributes are always lowercased
[11:40:57] <PHP_Ninja> Alright thanks, @decx, @ngharo

[12:29:14] <robertmaxrees> HeatherM sed and javascript are different.
[12:29:35] <mouse> yes but they are both using regular expressions
[12:29:36] <HeatherM> is the search patterns different?
[12:29:53] <robertmaxrees> HeatherM they use different regex engines.
[12:30:01] <robertmaxrees> javascript regex and sed regex are not the same thing.
[12:33:02] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY what's the issue you're having?
[12:34:20] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY is that .width() call getting a value you're expecting?
[12:35:09] <HeatherM> yah - i need to figure out if any characters come after that last comma, it would break the regex

[12:41:50] <sam-lap> hi guys shouldnt this be working ?
[12:41:53] <sam-lap> <input class="btn btn-primary btn-sm control-label" name="commit" type="submit" value="Entrar" onclick="if($(\"#new_access\").checkValidity()) { formhash(this.form, this.form.password);}"/>
[12:41:53] <sam-lap> ?
[12:42:00] <decx> there's probably a regex but you can also write a function with lastindexof and substr
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> sam-lap don't use onclick.
[12:42:08] <sam-lap> i just can get it to work w/o the if just formhash....
[12:42:23] <sam-lap> onsubmit then ?
[12:42:24] <robertmaxrees> use .on() instead.
[12:42:31] <robertmaxrees> in your javascript.
[12:42:43] <sam-lap> you lost me robert
[12:43:00] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/on/
[12:43:06] <robertmaxrees> you use this instead of an html attribute.
[12:43:33] <robertmaxrees> putting javascript in your html is mixing your separations of concern and is hard to do in the first place.
[12:45:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/7b228uto/
[12:45:36] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[12:48:22] <YamakasY> I wonder what the difference is between setting var foo = 200; or var foo = domainName.width() as there shouldn't be any
[12:48:26] <sam-lap> thaks robert
[12:48:31] <sam-lap> *thanks
[12:48:36] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY they both return numbers.
[12:48:43] <sam-lap> i did it like the example on that page
[12:49:05] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY there shouldn't be a difference.  what's the width you're getting from the .width() call?
[12:50:22] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: the with I need to get, like 200 or 144, or whatever, a number type
[12:50:26] <YamakasY> *width
[12:50:37] <robertmaxrees> so what's the actual value you're getting?
[12:50:53] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: erm, 200 for the first (it's a switch)
[12:50:58] <YamakasY> that works all fine
[12:51:13] <sam-lap> robert that seems not to be running the code inside the if
[12:51:23] <YamakasY> but what doesn't work i the animate, the slide... and that works with width = 200;
[12:51:31] <robertmaxrees> sam-lap is your js before or after the html?
[12:51:57] <robertmaxrees> sam-lap also: is the handler even running?
[12:52:16] <sam-lap> i've that at the bottom
[12:52:28] <robertmaxrees> sam-lap and if you put a console log in the handler, it runs?
[12:52:34] <sam-lap> sec
[12:53:14] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY if you debug it, are all the values correct?  any console errors or anything?
[12:53:27] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yap all works fine
[12:53:32] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: you saw my fiddle ?
[12:53:44] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY it's not a functioning fiddle so it's not terribly helpful ;)
[12:54:05] <robertmaxrees> i wonder if you're getting a weird value out of that width call.
[12:54:07] <sam-lap> yes it logs to the console
[12:54:10] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yeah true but it should work as static set it works :)
[12:54:19] <sam-lap> put on console.log ever and after the if
[12:54:29] <YamakasY> I did
[12:54:29] <sam-lap> just got the first console.log
[12:54:36] <YamakasY> oh btw
[12:54:40] <robertmaxrees> sam-lap then your if statement is probably wrong.  check each thing you're evaluating.
[12:54:48] <YamakasY> I saw once I didn't just sec
[12:55:37] <robertmaxrees> sam-lap you don't have more than one #new_access, right?
[12:56:00] <sam-lap> no just one
[12:56:10] <sam-lap> this alert(this.form.password);
[12:56:17] <robertmaxrees> use console.log(), not alert btw.
[12:56:29] <robertmaxrees> alert blocks the page from executing normally.
[12:56:40] <sam-lap> returns [object htmlelementinput]
[12:56:45] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:57:00] <robertmaxrees> but you're not even getting into the if statement, right?
[12:58:09] <HeatherM> another challenge
[12:58:10] <HeatherM> https://jsfiddle.net/22mxc610/1/
[12:58:51] <robertmaxrees> HeatherM try writing code first then ask us when you get stuck.

[12:59:28] <HeatherM> now i will get into it
[12:59:32] <robertmaxrees> lol 'kay.
[12:59:57] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY it's really hard to help you when you don't have a test case for us to work with.  why not make one?
[13:00:19] <sam-lap> hmm no console log from inside the if
[13:00:31] <robertmaxrees> sam-lap there you go. your checkvalidity isn't passing?
[13:00:55] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yeah need to but it's pulled out of zf2 and there are form attrributes in it, so need to really write something
[13:01:14] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY literally 75% of that is irrelevant to your code.
[13:01:14] <sam-lap> no
[13:02:00] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: I found it!
[13:02:04] <YamakasY> it's the prepend
[13:02:49] <YamakasY> if I comment it  it slieds
[13:02:51] <YamakasY> *slides
[13:03:17] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY so then the issue was not how you're grabbing the width?
[13:03:26] <robertmaxrees> but something totally unrelated?
[13:05:45] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: nah yes and no, I had it working that the span didn't matter but it does it seems
[13:06:02] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[13:07:21] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: that span is just parsed ?
[13:07:26] <robertmaxrees> what span?
[13:07:28] <YamakasY> when I prepends it ?
[13:07:44] <YamakasY> ttps://jsfiddle.net/mnznh6vk/6/
[13:07:46] <YamakasY> oops
[13:07:47] <robertmaxrees> i'm having a hard time following what you're talking about.
[13:07:52] <YamakasY> https://jsfiddle.net/mnznh6vk/6/
[13:08:11] <YamakasY> line 17
[13:08:36] <robertmaxrees> domainName.css('width', 0);, domainName.css('width', 'auto');, var width = domainName.width();
[13:08:50] <robertmaxrees> what else is in that domain element?
[13:09:22] <YamakasY> except the span you mean ?
[13:09:26] <robertmaxrees> also, what is domainName ?
[13:09:37] <robertmaxrees> i literally can't help you if i don't know what these vars are.
[13:10:31] <robertmaxrees> is it .domain ?
[13:10:49] <YamakasY> yes
[13:11:00] <YamakasY> but I don't see domainName not anymore, mhh
[13:11:07] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[13:11:20] <YamakasY> oh no indeed 			domainName = $('.domain', form),
[13:11:33] <YamakasY> so that is my element
[13:11:35] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see more because something here isn't adding up.
[13:11:57] <YamakasY> ok, need to check out if I can make a working versino
[13:12:00] <YamakasY> version
[13:12:21] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, it sounds like maybe you're adding/removing elements and expecting vars to magically update.
[13:13:17] <YamakasY> yeah that seems to do weird
[13:13:34] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY is that the case?
[13:14:28] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: not really, what I see happening is when I set that width on a value, static one like 200, than the auto is added after it, so it sets 200 and makes it wider from the .width
[13:14:35] <YamakasY> so that is quite funny to see
[13:14:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost, but ok.
[13:15:09] <YamakasY> yeah me too there, it looks like it doesn't honer what it's given as it's overwritten or so?
[13:15:26] <robertmaxrees> still not understanding what you're saying.
[13:15:44] <robertmaxrees> it will honor the value its given.
[13:16:25] <YamakasY> yeah, when it set it static, it makes is 200 + slide, if I don't it set's on 200 too (as that is the value of that element) and doesn't slide at all
[13:17:00] <robertmaxrees> you just said something about commenting out a prepend or something, though.
[13:17:20] <YamakasY> yes, line 17
[13:17:25] <YamakasY> checking out that css too
[13:17:29] <robertmaxrees> so when you comment that out, things work fine?
[13:17:34] <robertmaxrees> because your story isn't making sense.
[13:18:36] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: than the slide works, as it doesn't have any height anymore it's just a line bt that line slides
[13:18:39] <YamakasY> but
[13:19:03] <robertmaxrees> so then it's more then just setting a static value.  you change that and a few other things and magically it does what you want.
[13:19:04] <YamakasY> the first if part is a normal sleect box and that has height and slides too
[13:19:19] <robertmaxrees> this is why an isolated test case would be really helpful.
[13:19:31] <robertmaxrees> you have context of the problem - nobody else does, so it's hard to effectively help you.
[13:20:37] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: the span is the issue
[13:21:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:21:57] <YamakasY> yes checking it out, can fix it I think
[13:24:07] <PlanC> I'm creating new <div>s inside another <div>
[13:24:20] <PlanC> I'm adding a class to all the new divs
[13:24:31] <PlanC> but when I try to detect their clicks with click() I don't get them
[13:24:47] <robertmaxrees> is the binding directly on that class?
[13:25:13] <PlanC> yeah
[13:25:18] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[13:25:22] <robertmaxrees> the binding doesn't magically update.
[13:25:24] <robertmaxrees> check out http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:25:26] <PlanC> append("<div class='test'></div>");
[13:25:46] <robertmaxrees> you want to use .on() and bind to a parent and pass the optional second arg
[13:27:03] <PlanC> testing, sec
[13:35:00] <robertmaxrees> PlanC that fix it?
[13:36:02] <PlanC> didn't work
[13:36:11] <robertmaxrees> PlanC mind showing your code?
[13:36:21] <PlanC> changed the click() to on(click, ...
[13:36:38] <robertmaxrees> that's part of the story.
[13:36:42] <PlanC> it's a huge file that I'm adding this to
[13:36:49] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:36:51] <PlanC> I'm making some eggs, I'll be back in 20
[13:36:52] <robertmaxrees> lol i'll make an examplke.
[13:39:15] <robertmaxrees> PlanC for when you get back: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/med0vubo/

[13:50:19] <Guest13510> Anyone interested in writing a course on Javascript and modern Frontend development
[13:50:20] <robertmaxrees> Guest13510 are you looking for help on making soemthing like that?
[13:50:35] <Guest13510> We are a course providers
[13:50:43] <Guest13510> we are looking for freelance authors
[13:50:47] <robertmaxrees> ah, probably not the right place to look for that.
[13:50:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:50:57] <robertmaxrees> this is more of a support channel for jquery.
[13:51:01] <Guest13510> Any suggestions ?
[13:51:14] <robertmaxrees> not sure - probably #web?
[13:51:25] <Guest13510> True that
[13:51:30] <Guest13510> thanks for your help
[13:51:50] <robertmaxrees> sure! :)
[13:55:37] <HeatherM> pops head back up
[13:55:38] <HeatherM> https://jsfiddle.net/22mxc610/2/
[13:55:49] <HeatherM> am i headed in the right direction
[13:55:53] <robertmaxrees> nope./
[13:56:15] <robertmaxrees> $("#second .p:insertafter").$("#first .strong") doesn't make any sense - IDs are unique to a page.
[13:56:33] <robertmaxrees> and also, yeterday i explained that there's no .$() method
[13:56:35] <robertmaxrees> you want .find()
[13:57:44] <HeatherM>   // Make the first list item the last list item: var li = $( "#myList li:first" ).appendTo( "#myList" );   // Another approach to the same problem: $( "#myList" ).append( $( "#myList li:first" ) );
[13:57:50] <HeatherM> so more towards these examples
[13:57:55] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:58:14] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle and show us what you mean.
[13:59:16] <HeatherM> https://jsfiddle.net/22mxc610/3/
[13:59:55] <robertmaxrees> so you want to append $( "#first strong:first" ) to $('#second')?
[14:00:31] <HeatherM> https://jsfiddle.net/22mxc610/4/
[14:00:50] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[14:01:07] <HeatherM> just need to add an additional <P> to move it down the line
[14:01:15] <HeatherM> down a line
[14:01:15] <robertmaxrees> "move it down the line"?
[14:01:32] <robertmaxrees> you're not adding empty <p> tags are you?
[14:01:53] <HeatherM> no, i would want to wrap what's in strong, in a <p>
[14:02:03] <robertmaxrees> so then what's your question?
[14:02:13] <HeatherM> i have to figure out how to do that next
[14:02:16] <HeatherM> in that fiddle
[14:02:29] <robertmaxrees> so you want to append the strong to a <p> tag?
[14:02:36] <HeatherM> yes
[14:02:53] <robertmaxrees> then use .append()
[14:03:32] <robertmaxrees> $('someTarget').append('<p>');  $('someTarget p').append($('.yourThing'));
[14:03:39] <robertmaxrees> that's the basic idea.
[14:04:39] <HeatherM> if i wanted .youtThing to be on a new line, not flushed up against the SomeTarget
[14:05:11] <robertmaxrees> "on a new line" as in you want a line break?
[14:05:25] <robertmaxrees> or you want an extra "line" between the two?
[14:05:57] <HeatherM> extra line
[14:05:58] <HeatherM> https://jsfiddle.net/22mxc610/5/
[14:06:14] <robertmaxrees> . is not how you concat in js.
[14:06:18] <HeatherM> oh
[14:06:23] <robertmaxrees> and you can't concat that anyway.
[14:06:27] <robertmaxrees> since $() doesn't return a string.
[14:06:28] <HeatherM> ah
[14:06:34] <robertmaxrees> you need to use the series of appends that i described.
[14:06:43] <robertmaxrees> i didn't give you that example to be weird.
[14:06:51] <robertmaxrees> that's actually how you do that with nodes.
[14:06:57] <HeatherM> i thought you were showing me 2 ways to do it
[14:07:04] <HeatherM> now i see it was meant to be two steps
[14:07:05] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:07:07] <PlanC> robertmaxrees: ah I was doing $(child).on('click', function when it was supposed to be $(parent).on('click', child, function
[14:07:11] <PlanC> thanks for the help man!
[14:07:18] <robertmaxrees> PlanC yeah - the docs explain it all.
[14:08:01] <HeatherM> i get it now
[14:08:02] <HeatherM> https://jsfiddle.net/22mxc610/6/
[14:08:05] <PlanC> they sure do, but it's so much text
[14:08:16] <PlanC> reading 600 words to find my answer
[14:08:25] <PlanC> but on the other hand it teaches the fundamentals which is good
[14:08:33] <robertmaxrees> PlanC it's only a few minutes of reading, and the concept is super important to grok.  bubbling and propagation are really put deas.
[14:08:37] <robertmaxrees> head no.
[14:08:43] <robertmaxrees> err, HeatherM no
[14:08:45] <HeatherM> plans read 600 words a minute
[14:08:46] <HeatherM> wow
[14:09:02] <robertmaxrees> HeatherM you didn't read my example at all.
[14:09:16] <robertmaxrees> also, $('#second p:first') you can't append p tags to other p tags.
[14:09:31] <robertmaxrees> and you don't append closing tags - $('#second p:first').append('<p>'); appends <p></p> for you.
[14:09:49] <robertmaxrees> do https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/22mxc610/7/ instead.
[14:11:50] <hellyeah> anyone know about jqx calendar here
[14:11:52] <hellyeah> ?

[14:15:11] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah jqui has a calendar widget included, yes.
[14:15:25] <hellyeah> but with input box

[14:19:47] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[14:19:54] <robertmaxrees> is there a particular feature you're looking for?
[14:20:12] <hellyeah> i am using jqx calendar http://jsfiddle.net/nk1brr1k/30/
[14:20:33] <hellyeah> i wonder is there version in jquery ui similar to jqx calendar?
[14:21:15] <robertmaxrees> for which feature(s)?
[14:21:33] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:21:41] <hellyeah> for disabling spesific dates
[14:22:10] <hellyeah> when you select dates from datepicker above i want to disable date of range in the below calendar.
[14:22:17] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[14:22:32] <robertmaxrees> those docs will show you how to do that.  can't remember the option names to set that up.
[14:22:34] <robertmaxrees> but it's possible.
[14:23:35] <hellyeah> do you know jqx thing
[14:23:39] <hellyeah> jqx calendar?
[14:23:43] <robertmaxrees> no.

[14:25:07] <hellyeah> okey great
[14:25:10] <robertmaxrees> if you have actual questions, just ask :)
[14:25:16] <hellyeah> i cam from job
[14:25:25] <hellyeah> need to change my  clothes
[14:25:29] <hellyeah> five minuto
[14:25:30] <hellyeah> :D
[14:25:34] <hellyeah> thanks
[14:28:17] <YamakasY> damn I hate this
[14:30:27] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: it doesn't do my animate on a width = element.width() but does on width = 200;
[14:31:01] <robertmaxrees> and with other changes that you apparently make, too.
[14:31:20] <taplar_busy> q, what's the width when you do element.width()?
[14:31:36] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: nope, I removed the prepend, same happens
[14:31:50] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: 200 or what the .text() is
[14:32:06] <robertmaxrees> when you do element.width(), what do you get?
[14:32:12] <taplar_busy> width = element.width(); console.log(width) gives you 200?
[14:32:14] <YamakasY> a number
[14:32:18] <YamakasY> yap
[14:32:41] <taplar_busy> hum
[14:32:43] <YamakasY> and when I switch it gives other values, second part of the if/else statement
[14:33:18] <YamakasY> I'm almost thinking if it's a jquery bug, but I doubt it
[14:33:28] <robertmaxrees> very likely not.
[14:33:34] <robertmaxrees> make a test case.
[14:33:34] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:33:36] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: maybe some version I use
[14:33:46] <robertmaxrees> what version are you on?
[14:34:23] <YamakasY> 1.11 as 2.0 didn't support something we needed back the days
[14:34:37] <robertmaxrees> 1.11 wouldn't have any bugs getting element width.
[14:34:53] <robertmaxrees> at least, not like that.
[14:35:02] <YamakasY> ok, good to know
[14:35:17] <robertmaxrees> plus you said the console.log() of that value works just fine.
[14:35:26] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: yap true
[14:35:38] <YamakasY> but maube some animate issues with it
[14:35:55] <robertmaxrees> if you're passing in the same value, that wouldn't make sense.
[14:36:17] <taplar_busy> shouldn't matter, but did you change your fiddle so width isn't a var inside the if else?
[14:37:52] <hellyeah> pls create datepickers and select dates like 28-29 respectively you will see 27-28 is selected and check the console i guess json.stringify cause the problem but i dont know how to fix any idea http://jsfiddle.net/nk1brr1k/30/
[14:40:28] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: nope it's a var there
[14:40:40] <taplar_busy> try moving it after the if else
[14:40:46] <taplar_busy> it's the same last statement in both cases anyway
[14:40:57] <YamakasY> ok
[14:41:06] <taplar_busy> D.R.Y
[14:41:33] <robertmaxrees> i've done that a half dozen times and the code keeps moving back.
[14:41:46] <taplar_busy> lol
[14:41:50] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:42:09] <YamakasY> DRY ? I'm super wet
[14:42:14] <taplar_busy> google it
[14:42:14] <YamakasY> it's raining here
[14:42:22] <robertmaxrees> "don't repeat yourself" ;)

[14:45:12] <hellyeah> anything about my problem?
[14:46:35] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: i get the feeling that slides a little bit but could it be that it ignore the time for that
[14:47:54] <tkxxx> Hey. I'm trying to learn jquery and build an admin system for the school I work in. All is going well, but I've hit a wall. I want a MySQL query to load into a bootstrap modal, but whenever I post the form, the page refreshes and the modal can't load. If anybody could take a look I'd be very grateful! http://pastebin.com/Q4jWFUXe
[14:52:18] <robertmaxrees> tkxxx where's the js specifically?
[14:53:15] <tkxxx> @robertmaxrees At the bottom. I have just left in the PHP query and the modal js, as I was in a real tangle with it and thought I'd take it back to basics. Is it possible to do without having to use AJAX?
[14:53:29] <robertmaxrees> you want to load data without refreshing the page?
[14:53:34] <robertmaxrees> that requires ajax.
[14:54:31] <tkxxx> robertmaxrees: Ideally, yes. I see. I'll get reading the ajax docs. Would it require me to re-design the PHP (as that took me ages!), or is that okay?
[14:54:47] <robertmaxrees> i don't know php, but probably.
[14:54:58] <robertmaxrees> well sort of.
[14:55:07] <robertmaxrees> you'll use the ajax to post to a specific URL.
[14:55:15] <robertmaxrees> you'll also need to cancel the form's "submit" event.
[14:55:36] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/ is a good primer
[14:56:04] <tkxxx> robertmaxrees: Great. - thank you for the help, I'll get onto that.
[14:56:10] <robertmaxrees> yep :)
[14:58:52] <tkxxx> robertmaxrees: Apologies if this is naive, would it be possible to encode the query return as JSON, then parse it and hand it over to the modal?
[14:59:08] <deadevilboy> guys, where can I find a chat for TCPdf?
[14:59:21] <taplar_busy> tkxxx: json_encode(array)
[14:59:21] <robertmaxrees> yep.  php has json encoding capabilities and JSON is javascript object notation, so it's easy to use.
[14:59:49] <robertmaxrees> deadevilboy no idea.  ##php is the closest you'll probably get.
[14:59:59] <tkxxx> awesome. I'm thinking in terms of getting it done I will try that way... and save the ajax for bedtime reading! - thank you
[15:00:07] <deadevilboy> robertmaxrees: hi robert... thanks..
[15:00:16] <robertmaxrees> tkxxx you said you don't want the page to reload.
[15:00:23] <robertmaxrees> so using JSON is irrelevant in this case...
[15:00:46] <robertmaxrees> inasmuch as you should just render things out instead.
[15:00:49] <taplar_busy> tkxxx: if your going to be hitting an endpoint with ajax to get data, i would suggest segregating it so that's all it does.  not baked in with a complete html document
[15:00:57] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:01:39] <tkxxx> robertmaxrees: Understood - I will do just that, thanks both.
[15:25:34] <SmashingX> hey guys a newbie question: how can I select a button called test? https://jsfiddle.net/eLt11175/
[15:25:49] <robertmaxrees> # is for IDs.
[15:25:50] <robertmaxrees> #test
[15:26:26] <SmashingX> nice, thanks
[15:26:46] <SmashingX> just like css isn't?
[15:26:56] <robertmaxrees> css + some extras.
[15:27:17] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, all css selectors should work like you'd expect.
[15:27:57] <YamakasY> can I see in some debugger what is really runned by js/jquery ?
[15:28:11] <robertmaxrees> YamakasY what do you mean?
[15:28:51] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: if animate is running and with what parameters
[15:29:08] <robertmaxrees> sure - your browser has a step debugger build in.
[15:29:11] <robertmaxrees> *built
[15:29:23] <robertmaxrees> fixingthesejquery.com gives you a general rundown on them.
[15:31:11] <YamakasY> ok kewl I see the ev but need to check further on
[15:31:22] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[16:00:54] <z1haze> does .find() search recursively or just 1 level down
[16:01:19] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/find/ - gets all descendents filtered by a selector.
[16:01:59] <z1haze> does that mean it includes children of children.. i read it thats what im asking
[16:02:06] <robertmaxrees> all descendents, yes.
[16:02:10] <robertmaxrees> which means children of children.
[16:02:11] <z1haze> thanks
[16:02:15] <z1haze> i didnt know
[16:02:18] <robertmaxrees> that's what descendents means fwiw.
[16:02:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:08:47] <YamakasY> fixed you sexy prgrammers :D
[16:08:55] <robertmaxrees> what was the issue?
[16:09:17] <YamakasY> robertmaxrees: display '' and width 0 needed to be set
[16:09:21] <YamakasY> again
[16:09:25] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[16:10:04] <YamakasY> that was the original version I had working but because of reading up, lack of sleep and not giving up I didn't see it... but my POV is beter now :D
[16:10:07] <YamakasY> thanks guys
[16:10:29] * YamakasY will stay in this channel to add some sexyness to jquery :)
[16:10:44] <taplar_busy> unnecessary gold plating
[16:11:05] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, can you find by the text value of an element?
[16:11:16] <robertmaxrees> z1haze sure - .filter() is what i'd use.
[16:11:20] <YamakasY> z1haze: yes
[16:11:25] <z1haze> cool
[16:11:58] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: to jquery ? ppeople make/made jquery, not the code itself :D
[16:12:27] <z1haze> i dont see how to use the text value with filter()
[16:12:37] <YamakasY> taplar_busy: oh you want some love too ;)
[16:12:40] * YamakasY hugs taplar_busy 
[16:12:44] <robertmaxrees> z1haze make a fiddle.
[16:12:49] <z1haze> ok
[16:17:27] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, something like this https://jsfiddle.net/L28y1deg/1/
[16:17:42] <robertmaxrees> so what do you want?
[16:17:52] <z1haze> its resembling an ajax response for liking a post, i want to append the user to the likes list, and remove them if its a unlike
[16:18:09] <robertmaxrees> so i click on the button and then....?
[16:18:23] <z1haze> so if the icon returned is "thumbs_down" from the ajax response it would trigger the else { block
[16:18:33] <z1haze> where we need to delete the anchor from the dom with their username
[16:19:02] <z1haze> clicking the button just resembles the response from the server
[16:19:05] <robertmaxrees> wait what?  what does that have to do with your question about finding an element by text value?
[16:19:12] <z1haze> because
[16:19:19] <z1haze> <a href="#">z1haze</a>
[16:19:23] <z1haze> i need to remove that
[16:19:34] <z1haze> there will be a list of links with different names
[16:19:39] <z1haze> all who has liked the post
[16:19:46] <robertmaxrees> i'm way lost - what are you asking?
[16:19:49] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:19:52] <z1haze> :\ damn
[16:20:34] <z1haze> ok look: if you click like on a post, it submits an ajax request to the server, and it either likes or unlikes the post depending on if you liked it or not.. it returns data response in the sense of new data we will populate the div with
[16:20:37] <z1haze> follow this far?
[16:20:53] <robertmaxrees> 1 sec.
[16:20:58] <robertmaxrees> sorry, in the middle of something.
[16:21:34] <z1haze> ok, https://jsfiddle.net/L28y1deg/2/
[16:22:07] <z1haze> so if you click the button at first. it will 'add you to the likes' and if you are already on the likes and click the button, it needs to remove you from the list
[16:22:34] <z1haze> so id like to be able to select that link by the text inside the link
[16:23:29] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[16:23:36] <taplar_busy> will the username change?
[16:23:48] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably use a userid or something in a data attribute instead.
[16:23:50] <z1haze> it will match the current user so yes
[16:24:00] <taplar_busy> i mean, between clicks
[16:24:04] <taplar_busy> add then remove
[16:24:10] <z1haze> no
[16:24:21] <taplar_busy> i'd suggest keeping a reference to the link added then
[16:24:21] <z1haze> a users username will never change
[16:24:25] <taplar_busy> so you don't have to look it up at all
[16:24:39] <z1haze> yea but on a fresh page load
[16:24:43] <z1haze> if they are already in the liked list
[16:24:48] <taplar_busy> oh, so it can pre-exist
[16:24:49] <z1haze> they will just show their by default.. so we have no refernce
[16:24:52] <z1haze> 'yea
[16:24:55] <taplar_busy> nvm, :)
[16:25:01] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L28y1deg/3/
[16:26:07] <z1haze> robertmaxrees, the log of that is massive
[16:26:14] <robertmaxrees> ... not really.
[16:26:17] <robertmaxrees> it's a jquery object.
[16:26:24] <robertmaxrees> do you not see what that's doing?>
[16:26:33] <z1haze> no i dont its just a garbled mess for me
[16:26:38] <robertmaxrees> (wat)
[16:26:41] <z1haze> checking if they exist before hand?
[16:26:43] <z1haze> in the list
[16:26:55] <robertmaxrees> that's just filtering the collection down duder.
[16:27:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L28y1deg/4/
[16:27:25] <robertmaxrees> just showing you how you'd use filter.
[16:27:26] <robertmaxrees> that'sd all.
[16:27:36] <z1haze> is there no .find('a').attr('text', data.username) or something like that
[16:27:48] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:27:56] <robertmaxrees> .attr('text') would edit a text attribute.
[16:28:01] <z1haze> i just want to select the LINK by the value of the link
[16:28:01] <robertmaxrees> you want filter.
[16:28:08] <robertmaxrees> right, that's what this code does.
[16:28:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L28y1deg/4/ check this out.
[16:28:59] <z1haze> so all it does is return the object that matches
[16:29:10] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[16:29:15] <z1haze> ok cool.. its so crazy looking when i looked at the console
[16:29:22] <robertmaxrees> the console was showing you the jquery object.
[16:29:44] <z1haze> so can i just do theUser.delete() then?
[16:29:47] <z1haze> or remove() i think it is
[16:29:54] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:29:57] <z1haze> cool thanks
[16:30:49] <uskerine> hi, is it possible to hide/show elements based on a variable, state or something like that?  like I have a form and I want fields to be editable if state is "edit" or "new" and the button "save" to be shown, but same button hidden and fields non-editable when state is "view"
[16:31:02] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:31:12] <robertmaxrees> called a conditional - if /else if/ else, etc.
[16:32:09] <uskerine> robertmaxrees is it needed to implement it as if/else's? what if I change that variable state?
[16:32:26] <robertmaxrees> i would avoid that.
[16:32:47] <robertmaxrees> there's a way to support what you're getting after, but I would avoid it because it's very confusing.
[16:32:56] <uskerine> I would like the same web page to be able to deal with NEW, EDIT, VIEW and DELETE actions over a data form
[16:33:08] <robertmaxrees> right, do it with conditionals.
[16:33:15] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to use them at some point anyway.
[16:33:27] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're looking into observables which are really strange and hard to maintain.
[16:33:41] <uskerine> can you point the other way, just for knowing
[16:33:48] <uskerine> what is an observable?
[16:33:52] <robertmaxrees> search google :)
[16:33:58] <robertmaxrees> not going to help you shoot yourself in the foot.
[16:34:41] <robertmaxrees> and for what it's worth, you're still going to have to use a conditional even in those cases.
[16:34:52] <uskerine> uhm
[16:34:58] <robertmaxrees> you're just changing WHERE you're going to use it.
[16:35:50] <uskerine> so, is that the easiest way to hide/show and allow edit/disable edit depending on a given "state ?"
[16:36:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:36:49] <uskerine> I have a web page which contains a form and fields, and all possible buttons (new item, save, cancel, edit, delete)
[16:37:15] <robertmaxrees> right.  you bind listeners to each and handle them accordingly.
[16:37:29] <uskerine> and depending on page state user can edit fields or not, and user will see the right buttons (cancel and save if user is editing or adding, edit only if user is viewing, etc)
[16:37:54] <robertmaxrees> so you'd write functions that handle those discrete actions.
[16:38:34] <uskerine> I see
[16:38:52] <uskerine> can I bind something that reacts based on when a hidden field named "state" changes?
[16:39:04] <robertmaxrees> not in a sane way.
[16:39:08] <robertmaxrees> you want to call functions.
[16:39:19] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're proxying logic through the DOM, which is bad.
[16:39:34] <taplar_busy> or polling
[16:39:37] <taplar_busy> egh
[16:39:43] <robertmaxrees> polling is bad, too.
[16:40:49] <uskerine> interesting
[16:40:52] <robertmaxrees> why not just call functions instead of updating text boxes?
[16:41:09] <robertmaxrees> write explicit code, not implicit.
[16:41:17] <uskerine> you mean calling a function changeState?
[16:41:33] <robertmaxrees> you call functions when buttons are pressed.
[16:41:37] <robertmaxrees> those functions can call other functions.
[16:41:41] <robertmaxrees> like, you're overcomplicating it :)
[16:47:13] <uskerine> thanks robertmaxrees, I will think about it twice
[16:48:18] <uskerine> it would be great to have something in CSS that could hide or show depending on a status, or conditional formatting
[16:48:32] <taplar_busy> you can
[16:48:34] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[16:48:39] <taplar_busy> if your class is on your form
[16:48:47] <robertmaxrees> because CSS can handle someof that depending on what you're looking to do.
[16:49:17] <taplar_busy> form.hideChildren input.conditionalHide { display: none; }
[16:49:49] <taplar_busy> names could be better,  but that's the gist
[16:50:24] <uskerine> I am trying to understand what you say taplar_busy
[16:50:41] <uskerine> what is hideChildren?
[16:50:46] <taplar_busy> just a class name
[16:50:50] <taplar_busy> can be anything
[16:51:11] <taplar_busy> the point is, that will apply to inputs that have the class 'conditionalHide' who belong to a form that has the class 'hideChildren'
[16:51:18] <taplar_busy> remove any part of that, and they won't be hidden
[16:51:49] <uskerine> but that is not conditional CSS
[16:51:58] <taplar_busy> sure it is
[16:51:58] <robertmaxrees> you use the js to add/remove a single class.
[16:51:59] <uskerine> you still have to add or remove classes
[16:52:02] <robertmaxrees> the css does everything else for you.
[16:52:06] <robertmaxrees> right - that's a good thing.
[16:52:08] <uskerine> yeah I got it
[16:52:11] <uskerine> ok thanks
[16:52:17] <robertmaxrees> you want that.  magically changing stuff is bad.
[16:52:38] <uskerine> It has been some months since last time I used jQuery / CSS, feel rusty again
[16:56:49] <uskerine> I could add a class "stateAware" and a class "stateEdit"/"stateView" etc and depending on state it will hide all "stateAware" and show just the "stateEdit" or "stateView", etc depending on state
[16:57:01] <robertmaxrees> sure.  that's one way to do it.
[16:58:23] <taplar_busy> you could even use :not() for that
[16:58:39] <uskerine> so that sounds like flowing with the force of CSS/jQuery?
[16:58:46] <uskerine> what is :not() used for?
[16:58:54] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:not
[16:59:05] <taplar_busy> form.stateAware input:not(.stateAware) { display: none; }
[16:59:09] <taplar_busy> reads pretty well too
[17:36:26] <CarlosEduardo> anyone have any idea why the  alert (err.statusText);  It is not being formatted in UTF-8 format in this code http://www.sanwebe.com/2013/04/voting-system-with-jquery-php
[17:51:44] <jquery459> hey, I am posting data to a PHP file with jquery, but I am unsure what to return as response, which cannot be faked by a client - since it's a form validation it should not be possible to bypass it in any way without completing all fields.
[17:52:19] <taplar_busy> post?
[17:52:51] <taplar_busy> what CRUD operation are you doing?
[17:54:03] <jquery459> Data is being posted to a PHP file when a client clicks submit, but the PHP file should also return a response, whether the form is completed or not, so I can handle that response to prepare the next phase of the form
[17:54:18] <taplar_busy> what CRUD operation are you doing?
[17:54:40] <jquery459> As far as I am aware, technically a user can fake that response by the PHP file so he bypass the form validation
[17:54:57] <taplar_busy> huh?
[17:55:29] <taplar_busy> your worried that the user is going to intercept your server request?
[17:56:17] <jquery459> Well, if the client changes the url where the data is being posted to, and fakes the response returned, he could bypass it - or am I wrong in that
[17:56:30] <taplar_busy> he could sure
[17:56:33] <taplar_busy> what's the question?
[17:57:02] <jquery459> How can I prevent the user from tampering data, in a way I can be certain he is not bypassing anything
[17:57:10] <taplar_busy> you can't
[17:57:20] <taplar_busy> all you can do is sanitize on the server side
[17:57:41] <taplar_busy> never trust that the client validated anything
[17:58:13] <taplar_busy> client side validation is primarily to improve user experience
[17:59:04] <jquery459> Okay - I am aware of that. But if I validate the data server-side (while being posted with jQuery), how does the form "know" he can pass to a next phase
[17:59:17] <jquery459> I suppose the server should return something
[17:59:25] <taplar_busy> your response should let them know that
[17:59:33] <taplar_busy> 200 generally means it is ok to proceed
[17:59:48] <taplar_busy> depending on your operation, you can return error codes to signify an error
[17:59:54] <taplar_busy> which is why i asked what CRUD your doing
[18:00:21] <taplar_busy> but you can always return something in the response body telling the code what to do next
[18:00:38] <jquery459> I gathered, but technically a user could fake that 200 status so he passes to the next phase, or am I wrong in this
[18:00:49] <taplar_busy> and that's fine
[18:01:03] <taplar_busy> if they fake it, at some point there going to have to hit your server
[18:01:11] <taplar_busy> and at that point if it's not valid, they're stopped
[18:01:26] <jquery459> Argh I get your point :)
[18:01:41] <jquery459> You mean when they want to submit something in the end to the server - they have no choice
[18:01:52] <taplar_busy> only way to affect you, :)
[18:02:03] <taplar_busy> otherwise, they're just playing around on their machine
[18:02:34] <jquery459> Okay, haven't thought it through too well apparently.. you're right
[18:03:12] <jquery459> Stupid of me, but thanks for your fast reponse and advice, it is appreciated
[18:03:24] <jquery459> Have a good day, thank you!
[18:03:26] <taplar_busy> np.  it's always a good thing to be concerned about security
[18:03:39] <jquery459> I figured out so far :)
[18:03:51] <jquery459> Thanks !
[18:07:49] <taplar_busy> jquery459: one more thing
[18:08:42] <taplar_busy> that whole discussion is just one thing.  that doesn't include the things you should be doing with access rights, user rights, function rights, and the such to prevent users from accessing things they should not be.
[18:10:05] <taplar_busy> but related, all those things involve actually touching your server
[18:10:36] <taplar> yay, 5:00
[19:42:53] <BustyLoli-Chan> I have a web page that when I call JSON get on, it returns a 500 internal server error, but if I type the URL directly into a browser I can clearly see the JSON results
[19:43:02] <BustyLoli-Chan> does anyone know what might be causing this?
[19:43:27] <BustyLoli-Chan> https://music.hideaway.space/songs/get this is the JSON
[19:44:00] <BustyLoli-Chan> and when it's called with jsonGET from https://music.hideaway.space/page/top it errors
[19:46:53] <taplar> going straight to the url is getting the 500 also
[19:47:17] <BustyLoli-Chan> really?
[19:47:25] <taplar> check the network tab
[19:47:28] <BustyLoli-Chan> I can get it to load from where I am...
[19:47:36] <taplar> also around # 100 they're all null
[19:47:53] <taplar> so probably the endpoint is setting the response code to 500 while still returning data
[19:48:16] <BustyLoli-Chan> So you think because it encounters the null it thinks it's an error?
[19:48:35] <taplar> all i know is it's returning that json paired with a response code of 500
[19:48:50] <BustyLoli-Chan> Hmmm
[19:49:16] <BustyLoli-Chan> I do see what you mean by it's also throwing 500 error
[19:49:20] <BustyLoli-Chan> straight on the page itself
[19:49:26] <taplar> yep
[19:49:42] <BustyLoli-Chan> can I still pull the data in the event of a .fail(); ?
[19:49:48] <BustyLoli-Chan> or does jQuery chuck it all out?
[19:49:53] <taplar> you can, but you should really fix the error
[19:50:22] <BustyLoli-Chan> It's not actually my webpage
[19:50:39] <BustyLoli-Chan> I intend to tell them it's borked offer a temporary solution and then tell them to check internally what's going on
[19:51:02] <BustyLoli-Chan> Do you have any speculation as to why it might be throwing a 500 server error?
[19:52:11] <taplar> just guessing it's due to the nulls.  whatever process is loading that result is running out of stuff to put in it, but for some reason it's still looping to put nothing in it, and some part of that endpoint is smart enough to know that should be a 500 but for some reason is still returning data
[19:52:53] <BustyLoli-Chan> Alright
[19:53:10] <BustyLoli-Chan> I will let pass that information onto them, thank you very much, you have been extremely helpful
[19:53:19] <taplar> sure
[19:55:26] <taplar> also tell them if they don't want their email addresses to be harvested by webcrawlers, they might shouldn't put them directly on their contact page, :D
[19:56:00] <BustyLoli-Chan> lol
[19:56:02] <BustyLoli-Chan> Will do
[19:56:10] <taplar> unless they just love spam for some reason
[19:56:33] <taplar> looks like some college project site
[19:56:50] <BustyLoli-Chan> it is
[19:56:59] <BustyLoli-Chan> I think the people who wrote it don't really know what's going on with it
[19:57:19] <taplar> *shrugs* well if they're students
[19:57:19] <BustyLoli-Chan> and the event is next wednesday, the site is of interest me so I wanted to get the top 200 working
[20:23:28] <BustyLoli-Chan> fack this acees-control-allow-origin is preventing me from fixing this page
[20:53:57] <|aaron> can someone hep me understand what the ".data('select2')" call on line 11 of this fiddle does? http://jsfiddle.net/6jaodjzq/
[20:56:45] <BustyLoli-Chan> so even with the 500 internal server error, does anyone know how I can get the data from this page https://music.hideaway.space/songs/get
[20:56:56] <BustyLoli-Chan> I basically want to pull the data at all costs
[21:02:42] <kevireilly> |aaron: the `data` method is used to get and set data attributes on elements. Since it is the last in the chain, the value of <element data-select2="value"> is being returned to the `select2` variable
[21:05:13] <|aaron> kevireilly: hmm ok.. well what i want to do is return the select2 object class so that i can replace a method defined by the vendor in my code. but it seems like if i re move .data('select2') i jsut get the #select element instead? any idea what i should do here?
[21:07:33] <|aaron> nvm i think i see the problem
[22:35:43] <alturic> hey guys, I use a $(function() to preload a bunch of images, when I then swap out with a button mouseenter. I'm trying to find out if this would be considered "working as intended" or not... basically if I do this preloading of all the images, I don't see the browser making a call to re-validate the image, it only, always, uses the preloaded image. However, if I don't preload any of the images,
[22:35:43] <alturic> I see the browser always making a call to revalidate the image. My expectation is to yes, preload all these images, but when the mouseenter occurs, still re-validate... :-/
