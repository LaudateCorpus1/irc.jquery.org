[05:44:46] <dimi1947> is there a way with jquery code I can remove from the DOM a specific number of elements(inputs in my case)...the DOM has 5 and I want to remove 2 for examle
[06:56:11] <KnightsOfNi> does anyone know how I can get rid of the hash tag when using this? http://www.asual.com/jquery/address/
[08:32:24] <zampa> I have two triggers like this: $('.tab-game-content').change('select[name=scrap-rarity]', function() { one for a select and one for a checkbox, i cant figure out why say that trigger is triggered by checking the checkbox.
[08:32:35] <zampa> as that should hopefully only trigger on when the select is changed.
[10:03:25] <pokmo> what does el.find(".a .b") where el is an element actually mean? does it try to find an element with class="a b"?
[10:19:18] <pavonia> pokmo: It tries to find an element with class="b" somewhere within an element with class="a" somewhere within el
[10:19:32] <pokmo> pavonia, thanks
[10:20:18] <pavonia> Note the space which is important here, otherwise it would be what you said
[10:29:54] <pokmo> noted
[13:46:10] <codecutter> i have class that set visibility to hidden, how do i set a delay like the hide(200) prop?
[14:24:23] <fas3r> Hello, using ajax, is it possible to send an update from the server to the client while processing the query ?
[15:46:07] <aFeijo> hi guys, I want to deny an user to click on an input, or to change its content. I dont want to use the html disabled tag as it will cause the field data to not be sent on POST
[15:54:43] <Cork> aFeijo: set the field to readonly
[15:55:24] <Cork> <input name="show" value="forced" readonly>
[16:01:34] <aFeijo> I stated that I cant use it
[16:01:45] <aFeijo> disabled or readonly works the same, it disrupt post
[16:02:13] <aFeijo> I think I solved it with this simple jquery: $('input#id').keydown(function(){return false});
[16:11:21] <Cork> aFeijo: no, read only doesn't prevent the field from getting submitted, only disable does
[16:12:03] <aFeijo> weird, I was using readonly and my form had empty value for this field.
[16:12:16] <Cork> aFeijo: and that hack won't prevent modiication they can still paste into it
[16:13:29] <aFeijo> with the mouse? yeah, I will block mouse too
[16:14:19] <Cork> aFeijo: there are other ways to paste into a fields
[16:15:09] <Cork> aFeijo: really, this is the best option https://jsfiddle.net/p4f1yn9v/1/
[16:15:42] <Cork> result: https://fiddle.jshell.net/_display/?forced=included
[16:16:19] <aFeijo> nice example! good ideas, the css trick too, thanks
[16:17:00] <Cork> i use this a lot, it lets the user select the text, something disabled doesn't allow
[16:17:04] <Cork> but ya, they can't modify it
[16:18:04] <aFeijo> select and copy is important for my case
[16:21:08] <aFeijo> thank again! I gotta go :)
[16:33:44] <Technodrome> I am wondering if i can get some clarity here
