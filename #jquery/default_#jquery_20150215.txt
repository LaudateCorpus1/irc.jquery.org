[06:57:26] <Juslintek> Hey can someone tell me why jplayer is wrapping with some random divs seekbar when you drag and release it? http://utena.policija.lt/audio-test
[08:08:08] <ilhami> is it bad practice to have global vars?
[08:08:53] <Cork> normally yes
[08:09:00] <Cork> there are a few exceptions though
[08:09:23] <Cork> but normally you should just create a scope around the code and keep the variable there
[08:09:29] <ilhami> let's say I have an array I want to use inside a .submit() ?
[08:09:39] <ilhami> I mean an object*
[08:09:47] <Juslintek> Its not bad practice if you pass them from php and you can't pass them directly into js file. But you can build one with js header.
[08:09:51] <Cork> you mean like a reference for validation?
[08:10:15] <Juslintek> Cork, are you familiar with jplayer?
[08:10:33] <Cork> Juslintek: i've used it, but not a lot
[08:10:52] <ilhami> I dont have php involved in my code dude
[08:10:53] <Juslintek> Cork, have you used it with jquery ui?
[08:10:57] <ilhami> it's a google chrome extension
[08:11:17] <Cork> ilhami: create a self executing function and keep the data there
[08:11:39] <Cork> (function() { var none_global = []; $().submit(...); })();
[08:11:52] <ilhami> Cork let me show you my code :P
[08:11:53] <ilhami> ?
[08:12:00] <Cork> or (function(arr) { $().submit(...); })([]); if you prefer that
[08:13:45] <Cork> Juslintek: opps, yes i have
[08:14:08] <Cork> or rather i've used it with dialog
[08:15:07] <Juslintek> Cork, I have a problem over here: http://utena.policija.lt/audio-test when you drag and release any slider it gets div wrapped, without any class or anything, which is uber annoying and it does overflow hidden, and position absolute and left: 0, which f* up all the effort in css.
[08:16:11] <Juslintek> Cork, and I can't figure out who is doing that, is it jquery-ui or jplayer
[08:17:01] <Cork> most likely not jquery ui
[08:17:30] <ilhami> how do I append to localStorage instead of overwriting? :D
[08:18:19] <Cork> read, append, write
[08:19:04] <Cork> meaning you have to do it manually
[08:19:41] <Cork> Juslintek: i don't have the right setup to make that kind of diagnostics right now
[08:20:06] <Juslintek> Cork, what setup do I need to diagnose?
[08:20:10] <ilhami> why did they make it like that? :s
[08:20:39] <Cork> ilhami: cause localstorage is a shitty solution from beginning to end
[08:20:40] <ilhami> how would I append to this: list['url'] ?
[08:20:51] <ilhami> so I should use something else?
[08:20:59] <Cork> ilhami: like i said you would have to read it, modify it and then write it back
[08:21:31] <ilhami> list['url'].append(protocol + url);
[08:21:32] <ilhami> can I do this?
[08:21:33] <ilhami> :D
[08:21:47] <Cork> ilhami: there is indexeddb its a real database
[08:21:52] <ilhami> what do you think I should use instead of localStorage?
[08:21:55] <ilhami> oh
[08:22:06] <Cork> but it is a more complex solution
[08:22:18] <Cork> and ppl like to be lazy
[08:22:18] <ilhami> Cork but a better one right?
[08:22:24] <Cork> definitely
[08:22:32] <ilhami> does all browsers support IndexedDB?
[08:22:42] <ilhami> do*
[08:22:44] <Cork> as it doesn't force the browser to cache the entire database in ram before rendering a page
[08:23:03] <Cork> (localstorages syntax does this)
[08:23:16] <Cork> ?mdn indexeddb
[08:23:16] <b-ot> Cork: IndexedDB - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API
[08:23:23] <Cork> read the compatibility table
[08:24:09] <ilhami> well IE less than 10 doesnt support it
[08:24:20] <Cork> Juslintek: mainly a firefox setup for development with (including firebug)
[08:24:28] <ilhami> but for me only Chrome is actually important right now.
[08:24:40] <ilhami> I guess I can use it then
[08:25:11] <Cork> ilhami: note depending on how the data is structured you might have the same problem in indexed db
[08:25:28] <ilhami> dude I only store some urls
[08:25:32] <Cork> but there you have have rows for the data something localstorage doesn't support
[08:26:01] <ilhami> it's not like I have tons of data.
[08:26:11] <Cork> ilhami: i don't have a clue what data you use all i know is that is it somehow related to "list[url]"
[08:27:07] <ilhami> yeah it's just a list of urls heh
[08:27:29] <ilhami> but IndexedDB sounds pretty awesome.
[08:27:34] <Cork> well that would be the rows in indexdb ya
[08:27:49] <Cork> *indexed
[08:29:05] <Cork> localstorage can store key: string pares, that's it
[08:30:32] <ilhami> yeah
[08:30:40] <ilhami> IndexedDB sounds more flexible.
[08:31:25] <rbo> morning all :)
[08:31:35] <Cork> not yet ;P
[08:31:43] <Cork> come again on ~12h
[08:31:59] <rbo> in*
[08:32:04] <rbo> :D
[08:32:05] <Cork> opps
[08:32:08] <rbo> oops*
[08:32:09] <rbo> xD
[08:33:50] <ilhami> LOL
[08:34:20] <rbo> damnit why the hell am I so afraid to use JSON?
[08:34:38] <Cork> O_o'
[08:34:42] <Cork> why are you?
[08:34:44] <ilhami> afraid?
[08:34:47] <ilhami> json is easy dude.
[08:35:03] <Cork> you wouldn't like my code :D
[08:35:16] <ilhami> you wouldn't like mine either.
[08:35:16] <rbo> More like I just don't know how to.
[08:35:22] <ilhami> rbo, google :P'
[08:35:24] <ilhami> or ask here
[08:35:48] <Cork> rbo: all languages has built in support for rendering native data structures to json now days
[08:36:08] <Cork> as long as you make sure to use them, its really easy
[08:37:56] <rbo> Cork thanks, i'm trying to wrap my head around it.
[08:38:03] <rbo> ****do not smoke any marijuana ****
[08:38:04] <rbo> lol
[08:38:13] <rbo> if i do i will just waste time
[08:38:26] <Cork> rbo: json is a simplified version of javascript objects + arrays + natives
[08:38:41] <Cork> nothing more nothing less
[08:39:02] <rbo> I just need a good example of actually using it from a real api source and then parsing it and then calling the objects when needed
[08:39:39] <Cork> rbo: if you use jquery and configure the server correctly, you don't need to parse it
[08:40:15] <Cork> $.ajax(url_to_json).done(function(json) { if(json.key === value) {} });
[08:40:35] <Cork> as long as the server doesn't lie about the content type that is all you need
[08:48:26] <psykrsna> My question is - How do I send an image over an Ajax request?
[08:48:51] <Cork> psykrsna: normally: you don't
[08:48:59] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[08:49:41] <Cork> psykrsna: normally you send an url that the page can later use to access the image
[08:49:53] <Cork> or if you send html you embed an <img> tag
[08:49:55] <psykrsna> I need to send the image over Ajax so that the server can save it
[08:50:01] <Cork> ah
[08:50:13] <Cork> you need to upload an image
[08:50:18] <Cork> not the same thing :)
[08:50:28] <psykrsna> sorry, yes upload an image
[08:50:30] <Cork> ?mdn formdata
[08:50:31] <b-ot> Cork: FormData - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData
[08:50:34] <Cork> ^
[08:50:44] <rbo> stupid thing.
[08:51:27] <rbo> Cork, So i just setup that line of ajax in a .js file and call it when needed?
[08:51:58] <Cork> rbo: no that line will trigger an ajax call
[08:52:10] <Cork> the function in .done will have the json the server sent back
[08:58:36] <ilhami> Cork, what does it mean to create an object store?
[08:58:49] <ilhami> is it just an object where you can store data?
[08:58:52] <ilhami> :P
[08:58:57] <ilhami> like a json object
[08:59:13] <ilhami> You can only create object stores inside a "versionchange" transaction.
[08:59:21] <ilhami> apparently.
[09:01:29] <Cork> ilhami: indexeddb is a full database, so you need to set up a schema for the data you want to store
[09:01:39] <Cork> that is the object store
[09:01:43] <ilhami> ok I see.
[09:01:48] <rbo> Cork, what about displaying the results, for instance, within a <span class="blah'>JSON results here</span>
[09:02:01] <rbo> is that how it works?
[09:02:10] <Cork> rbo: normally no
[09:02:22] <Cork> json is normally raw data for js to process
[09:02:33] <rbo> I guess thats where i'm not understanding it.
[09:02:44] <Cork> and one of the properties could contain html for example
[09:03:00] <Cork> rbo: json is structured data, meaning you can send more then just one value
[09:03:02] <rbo> well you store it in a dictionary and then call the object of that dictionary?
[09:03:27] <rbo> ok I think I need to study more :\
[09:03:28] <Cork> what languages do you know?
[09:03:56] <ajeremias> eyy! I have this doubt: http://jsfiddle.net/3s1hz7nd/ I am adding new links with my jquery... but then this elements are not detected, because they were not in the DOM when the bindings were set.. how can I solve this?
[09:04:29] <Cork> rbo: json mapps to arrays/objects in javascript, arrays in php, maps/hash and array in ruby/c/c#/so on...
[09:04:36] <rbo> Cork, I'm not going to claim knowing any language.
[09:04:39] <Cork> its just a way to structure data
[09:04:56] <Cork> it isn't a for a single purpose
[09:05:16] <Cork> for example you could have a validation api
[09:05:42] <rbo> https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide#crossdomain
[09:05:53] <Cork> where the response would be { error:true/false, message: "what was wrong if error is true" }
[09:06:04] <rbo> that's what i'm looking at right now.
[09:06:14] <rbo> trying to implement that information to show in a div.
[09:06:26] <rbo> but of course the clientID would be the api key i requested from SC
[09:06:27] <Cork> that is jsonp though
[09:06:29] <Cork> and not json
[09:06:37] <rbo> ok
[09:08:12] <rbo> Cork, I will practice more for a while and come back when I have a real question to ask. It will be better lol.
[09:09:16] <rbo> I feel like such a noob -_-
[09:10:05] <MikeRogers0> Don't worry, once you get past the initial learning curve it gets easier.
[09:12:53] <rbo> MikeRogers0, the amount of time i've spent learning this stuff i should know it by now, maybe just not learning it the right way :\
[09:13:10] <rbo> fail xD
[09:13:39] <rbo> MikeRogers0, the amount of time i've spent learning this stuff i should know it by now, maybe just not learning it the right way :\
[09:13:40] <rbo> :)
[09:13:41] <Cork> rbo: a good start is to learn the data structures in js
[09:13:59] <Cork> json should come by it self when you get that part
[09:19:18] <ajeremias> http://jsfiddle.net/3s1hz7nd/ I can't get this to work... my elements are not detected in jquery... why? and how do I solve it?
[09:22:13] <rbo> ajeremias, changes for me just fine. o_O
[09:22:34] <ajeremias> rbo: click on the new links created!
[09:22:57] <rbo> your link just refers back to # so it will not do anything.
[09:24:24] <ajeremias> hmm, u didnt get it.. when u click.. a new link appears.. the new link wont work.. will not create a new link... check the solution here.. someone helped me on javascript
[09:24:24] <ajeremias> http://jsfiddle.net/3s1hz7nd/1/
[09:24:32] <ajeremias> i was binding to a non-existent element
[09:39:25] <Tomashe> Hey guys i need some plugin that hide all photos that are not in my viewport, any ideas?
[09:58:07] <ajeremias> ei! I have this script: http://jsfiddle.net/3s1hz7nd/3/ what happens is that keyup is called way to more than times than it needs... (instead of a sleep I have a ajax request) how do I avoid some keyup calls?
[10:06:41] <Cork> ajeremias: 1. use on('input' instead of keyup
[10:06:52] <Tomashe> there is a way to hide images that not in viewport anymore?
[10:06:53] <Cork> secondly use a timer to wait for rapid key presses
[10:07:08] <Cork> Tomashe: there is, but it isn't easy
[10:07:12] <Tomashe> hmm
[10:07:36] <Tomashe> i want to make lazyload just remove thet images back when they are gone from viewport
[10:07:48] <Tomashe> it seems when i load like 1000+ images it makes the entire page slow
[10:07:55] <Tomashe> so my goal is just to hide them back when im gone
[10:08:20] <Cork> you would have to remove lazy create the elements
[10:08:26] <Cork> uh..
[10:08:33] <Cork> *you would have to lazy create the elements too
[10:08:46] <Cork> cause the images are loaded when the parser parses the <img> tag
[10:09:12] <Tomashe> hmm
[10:10:03] <Tomashe> i did not get what i need to do
[10:10:29] <Cork> Tomashe: the browser will fetch the image as soon as an img tag is created
[10:10:36] <Cork> even if you don't attach it to the page
[10:10:58] <Cork> so if you want to remove that part you need to not have the img tag at all before the scroll comes to there
[10:10:59] <Tomashe> yes but on lazy load its <img data-src=""> no "src" attribute
[10:11:18] <Cork> eh..
[10:11:27] <Cork> you would have a ton of image with error in them instead
[10:11:52] <Cork> its cleaner to create the image when you need to instead
[10:12:03] <Tomashe> you mean on scroll
[10:12:17] <Cork> and most of the load time comes from the dom having too many elements anyway
[10:12:31] <Cork> yes, that is what you would have to base it on anyway
[10:12:39] <Tomashe> hmm
[10:12:54] <Tomashe> i dont think u are right , when i load those elements without the images all run very fast
[10:13:05] <Tomashe> as soon as i put the images again im toasted
[10:13:16] <Cork> in what browser?
[10:13:27] <Cork> modern browser should lazy render the images already
[10:13:43] <Cork> so all that's left is the network load and the dom size
[10:13:55] <Tomashe> hmm
[10:13:56] <Tomashe> chrome
[10:13:57] <Cork> and network load shouldn't cause lag in the page
[10:13:57] <ajeremias>  http://jsfiddle.net/3s1hz7nd/3/ -> solution http://jsfiddle.net/3s1hz7nd/4/ thanks to Cork !
[10:14:31] <Cork> Tomashe: hmm, chrome should do that...
[10:15:23] <Cork> ajeremias: uh.. sleep?!?!
[10:15:35] <ajeremias> to replace the ajax... ;)
[10:15:49] <Cork> ajeremias: i hope you aren't doing sync ajax...
[10:16:10] <ajeremias> im a c programmer... what do u mean sync ajax?
[10:16:25] <ajeremias> nooo.. im using async.. and the problem was the concurrency!
[10:16:27] <Cork> ajeremias: the for loop there is effectively freezing the page
[10:16:53] <Cork> it is something you should never do in js
[10:16:54] <ajeremias> of course.. that is a hard-coded sleep... i dont use it..
[10:17:11] <Cork> ajeremias: it freezes the browser ui and everything
[10:17:22] <Cork> it is NOT an emulation of async ajax
[10:17:47] <ajeremias> ok ok.. i copied it from a website.. that had this implementation of sleep.. i should had used setTimeout.. but i was lazy
[10:18:03] <Cork> ugg...
[10:18:09] <Cork> lovely...
[10:18:28] <Cork> ajeremias: i would recommend avoiding everything said from the writer of that script
[10:19:22] <ajeremias> i understand what u mean... it is just doing a loop to slow down the execution... it is nonsense...
[10:20:14] <_X_C_V_B_> how do I rotate an image in 3d using the html5 canvas?
[10:21:36] <Cork> ajeremias: it isn't just nonsense, it is about the worst thing you can do in js
[10:22:29] <ajeremias> ok, i got it!

[10:56:29] <Siente> Hello guys, I am trying this example http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/#jQuery-ajax-settings Retrieve the latest version of an HTML page. but why it is not working?
[11:00:55] <arthurvr> Siente: what example exactly?
[11:05:27] <tnu0> Hi there. Stupid nooby question: I'd like to say to jQuery "When I click on div#foo, do that…". It works if I do $('div#foo').each(function() {   $(this).click(function(event) { // some code… });    });
[11:05:57] <tnu0> My question is : Shouldn'it work with : $('div#foo').click(function(event) { // some code… });    });    ?
[11:06:12] <tnu0> Is .each function useful if I only have one element?
[11:08:20] <tnu0> Sorry, it will be easier to read this way :) https://gist.github.com/Einenlum/37e94aab5b6cc00d1742
[11:11:08] <Siente> how to use jQuery with PHP?
[11:11:17] <Siente> are there any docs about that?
[11:12:14] <tnu0> Woops, sorry for my question. Seems to work actually :)
[11:12:38] <tnu0> Siente, I don't understand your question. PHP is backend stuff. Does not change anything if you are using PHP, Django or ROR
[11:14:37] <rbo> yeh
[11:22:29] <Juslintek> anyone know how not to progress with submit, until upload is done? On jqueryform?
[11:22:49] <Juslintek> I do in UploadProgress                       if(event === 'load'){
[11:22:49] <Juslintek>                         setTimeout(function(){
[11:22:49] <Juslintek>                         return true;
[11:22:49] <Juslintek>                         }, 3000);
[11:22:49] <Juslintek>                       } else {
[11:22:50] <Juslintek>                         return false;
[11:22:52] <Juslintek>                       }
[11:23:07] <Juslintek> But still form skips to complete
[11:23:25] <Juslintek> I mean success not complete
[11:24:05] <Juslintek> maybe I should launch jquery in complete that is suppose to be started in success
[11:28:01] <sacho> don't paste in the channel please
[11:28:24] <Juslintek> sacho sorry
[11:28:31] <Juslintek> I thought it will paste in one line...
[11:28:51] <rbo> paste in paste bin!!
[11:28:57] <rbo> or similar!!
[11:29:00] <Juslintek> rbo okay
[11:29:10] <Juslintek> rbo, I'm sorry
[11:33:32] <Juslintek> So anyone can give me suggestion how not to proceed with form till uploadProgress is done?
[11:34:02] <Juslintek> and as well set some delay, so one submitting for can be sure that its was completed successfully.
[12:36:15] <titanomachy> How should I do a form field fill for a modal popup? I have a button which opens a modal on click. The modal has a form for which I need to set a value, but whatever I try it won´t work. I use the .val() method for setting it. I guess the value is set to early?
[13:13:47] <titanomachy> Got it.

[14:16:29] <arthurvr> Hey dr_ichel!
[14:16:33] <dr_ichel> hiho
[14:16:58] <dr_ichel> id like to ask a propably stupid question (at the right chan this time) - ive got a website and im using stickUp.js for some sticky Sidebar http://lirancohen.github.io/stickUp/ to make the magic happen i just have to call it on a selector (on doc ready) $('.navbar-wrapper').stickUp();
[14:17:25] <dr_ichel> my idea was to use MQWatch https://github.com/slashworks/MQwatch to terminate this call on the right screen width
[14:17:47] <dr_ichel> but i dont get how to „unbind“ stickup oO
[14:18:23] <dr_ichel> oops forgot the essencial  part: i want to terminate it in tablet/mobile view
[14:19:07] <dr_ichel> but let it work on tablet landscape and desktop
[14:31:38] <ajeremias> dr_ichel: why dont u use css to hide that menu, and showing another one for mobile/tablet ?
[14:34:15] <dr_ichel> ajeremias: ehm thats actually plan b - but i would like to keep the sidebar - it is positioned with a grid system and if i just could break the stickupthing in the smaller views i would get exactly what i want - the sidebar styled under the content on full width
[14:35:17] <ajeremias> ok.. i checked the source code of stickup.. and there is no "unbind".. maybe u can implement it.. its not so hard!
[14:36:52] <dr_ichel> ajeremias: hmm thats what i thought :( - thx then, lets see how this thingy works - im propably gonna ask another stupid question in some minutes ^^
[14:37:45] <ajeremias> well we all learning.. i also sometimes ask weird stuff. :x
[14:54:47] <bsegovia> anyone ever wired up a progress bar before? I have two kinds I need to make (1) file upload and (2) batch send email. I see tons of posts and tuts on how to make it look pretty, but not much on how to actually detect the upload progress of a file. I’m using rails as a backend so I guess the rails app needs to pass variables to the JS code? Anyway, I feel like this is something that everyone should know how to do and I’m sitting here totally at a loss
[14:54:48] <bsegovia> where to proceed.
[15:06:02] <dr_ichel> ajeremias: hehe for the record - i got it with removing the class „isStuck“ on smaller views - this will do it, i hope ^
[15:06:55] <Tomashe> Guys if i do $.each($("div").find("sel"),function(key,value){ console.log(value.data("id"); });
[15:07:10] <Tomashe> tere is a wayt ot get the actual object attribute data inside a loop?
[15:15:52] <Tomashe> ?
[15:34:22] <Wolfram74> I'm having a wonky thing with event triggers
[15:35:42] <Wolfram74> http://dpaste.com/3MZCYDD
[15:36:23] <Wolfram74> so the addTodo event triggers like it should, but the new buttons in the divs it creates don't trigger the shout method like they should
[15:36:34] <Woet> Wolfram74: www.jsfiddle.net please
[15:36:38] <Wolfram74> ok
[15:36:40] <Woet> turn it into a working demo
[15:38:03] <Wolfram74> slight shortcoming: i have an ajax call to a local hosted server
[15:38:17] <Wolfram74> so it will lack the final behavior
[15:39:51] <Wolfram74> http://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=35QtzFNEDQ
[15:40:29] <Woet> [09:36:40]  <Woet>	turn it into a /working/ demo
[15:40:56] <Wolfram74> how do i get it to simulate the ajax call?
[15:41:08] <Woet> is it relevant to the issue?
[15:41:34] <Wolfram74> well the ajax call is how new cells are generated and it's the newly generated cells that aren't getting their event handlers noticed
[15:41:46] <Woet> so fake it with dummy data
[15:41:58] <Woet> also, the /working/ mostly refers to the fact you didn't even pick jQuery on the left, so it'll never work.
[15:45:01] <Wolfram74> sorry, i've barely ever used jsfiddle so far
[15:47:48] <Wolfram74> so this should do things now
[15:49:03] <Woet> Wolfram74: you are running bindEvents(); before the AJAX call is completed
[15:49:30] <Woet> and it adds events to elements that already have events
[15:49:40] <Wolfram74> line 25 is still inside the ajax call?
[15:49:52] <Woet> it isn't, it's below it.
[15:50:19] <Wolfram74> so wouldn't the call be finished by the time it ge- right, queing
[15:50:21] <Wolfram74> fuck
[15:50:28] <Woet> ajax calls are asynchronous.
[15:50:38] <Wolfram74> ok, let me look up time delays
[15:50:40] <Woet> that's why it has the done event (which you're using makeCell)
[15:50:42] <Woet> why?
[15:51:06] <Wolfram74> ok, place bindEvents inside makeCell then?
[15:51:24] <Woet> or inside the .done event of ajax
[15:51:43] <Wolfram74> can i call several functions lke that?
[15:52:11] <Wolfram74> like ".done(f1, f2);"?
[15:52:20] <Woet> read the documentation
[15:52:31] <Wolfram74> school of hard knocks, you are
[15:53:43] <Woet> being able to read documentation is a pretty important skill.
[15:54:29] <Wolfram74> I'm not disputing that, and clearly i'm not in a position to say that I have that skill, just poking fun at you
[15:54:46] <Wolfram74> but thanks for providing the insight that you have
[15:55:06] <Wolfram74> i got the kludgey solution to work, but I'll see if I can't do two calls inside the done
[15:55:22] <Wolfram74> my current intuition has it that I'd need to make an anonymous function that called both
[15:56:43] <Wolfram74> though this http://api.jquery.com/deferred.done/ looks like it would be happy enough if were just comma seperated
[15:57:13] <Wolfram74> woo, that also worked
[15:57:55] <Woet> :)
[15:59:34] <yep> Hi, for xml documents is there a shorthand version for walking through children (without using find which may return unwanted matches): jQuery(d).children("args").children("containerresponse").children("help").text()
[16:02:10] <OnceMe> I have this input:radio[name=someradiobtns] and for each click, each element is for itself when I append elements
[16:02:13] <OnceMe> can I somehow avoid this?>
[16:05:27] <Woet> OnceMe: www.jsfiddle.net please
[16:07:00] <OnceMe> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/fpdom1j9/
[16:07:19] <OnceMe> so I have 4 radio buttons with name someBtns
[16:07:29] <OnceMe> and whenever I click each of them, I get new appended element
[16:07:41] <OnceMe> it works if I put delegate('','click'..) with first param empty
[16:07:57] <OnceMe> but that will actually trigger appending only once, which is good, but will trigger it when I click anywhere on form
[16:09:14] <Woet> so.. what is the problem? the code matches what you're saying
[16:09:23] <Woet> "this" refers to the radio button you click
[16:09:29] <Woet> so if you click another one, it will trigger again
[16:09:40] <OnceMe> yes
[16:09:41] <Woet> also, .delete has been superseded by .on since 1.7
[16:09:43] <OnceMe> except I want not to
[16:09:47] <Woet> so don't use "this"
[16:10:01] <OnceMe> what ot use?
[16:10:17] <Woet> i'm not sure why you don't just check for the existence of a submit button
[16:11:12] <OnceMe> ok using not this
[16:11:12] <OnceMe> worked
[16:12:17] <Wolfram74> oh my
[16:12:38] <Wolfram74> i have discovered an interesting consequence of calling bindEvents after every creation
[16:12:51] <Wolfram74> buttons are becoming multiply-bound
[16:12:58] <Woet> i told you about that
[16:13:04] <Woet> [09:49:30]  <Woet>	and it adds events to elements that already have events
[16:13:36] <Wolfram74> ah yes, the thing right after the bolded text that drew all my attention
[16:13:55] <Wolfram74> so
[16:14:13] <Wolfram74> on the one hand, I need to bind the new buttons, and on the other hand i need to not rebind old buttons
[16:14:35] <Wolfram74> calling bind during the creation process works for criterion 1 but not criterion 2
[16:15:00] <Wolfram74> impulse says since the bindEvents method handles everything, just start that method by nuking all pre-existing binds
[16:15:53] <Wolfram74> such as with $(document).unbind()
[16:16:34] <Wolfram74> or $(document).off()
[16:17:02] <Wolfram74> not as such, no
[16:17:04] <Wolfram74> hrmmm
[16:17:30] <Wolfram74> unbind didn't do it either
[16:18:24] <Wolfram74> trying $("*")
[16:18:36] <Wolfram74> woo
[16:18:44] <Wolfram74>   $("*").off()
[16:18:46] <Wolfram74> ok
[16:37:09] <neredsenvy> If I have multiple fields with id="value" is there any way to retrieve them all ? $('#value') only returns first one
[16:38:46] <neredsenvy> $('td[id=value]) works but : /
[16:39:16] <neredsenvy> but how do I do :contains or :empty on that ?
[16:39:58] <neredsenvy> Oh I guess it works : (
[16:59:42] <jayjo> Is there a way to search for any children of an element? I want a box to select all children input boxes, but this code isn't working: http://pastebin.com/MSpdMN3E
[17:12:36] <sacho_> .children("input...")
[17:56:52] <apb1963> i'm trying to use a plugin called jtable and I'm having great difficulty getting output.
[17:58:34] <apb1963> Here's a link to it: http://jtable.org/GettingStarted#ListAction
[18:25:07] <Xoro> Can anyone give me a hint on how to use a bool in this function?
[18:25:08] <Xoro> http://jsfiddle.net/5pk5fcy0/1/
[18:25:50] <Xoro> I'm not sure how to set up a single function to map a bool for multiple objects
[18:27:53] <Xoro> http://jsfiddle.net/5pk5fcy0/3/
[18:28:08] <Xoro> I guess I should fix that a bit so I don't look like a retard
[19:34:15] <Jakey> hi i need help selecting an input box that has an attribute "name='dddd'"
[19:34:20] <Jakey> how do i select that?
[19:35:35] <Woet> google -> jquery select by name
[19:36:03] <Jakey> oh f geezzz Woet
[19:36:08] <Jakey> duh
[19:36:18] <Jakey> why don't you just spit it out
[19:36:20] <Jakey> duh
[20:10:57] <Jakey> hi
[20:11:15] <Jakey> can you modified a read only field from javascript?
[20:11:18] <bsegovia> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+select+by+name
[20:12:06] <brad1121> yes
[20:12:37] <Jakey> brad1121: yes what
[20:12:52] <brad1121> js you can mod a read only field
[20:12:53] <Jakey> brad1121: i'm using this pluing https://github.com/customd/jquery-number
[20:13:02] <Jakey> try it on read only input field
[20:13:06] <Jakey> it doesn't work for me
[20:13:23] <Jakey> it doesnt format the numbers inside the input
[20:13:30] <brad1121> turn readonly off
[20:13:33] <brad1121> mod numbers
[20:13:35] <brad1121> turn back on
[20:13:51] <Jakey> lol no way brad1121
[20:13:53] <Jakey> too lame
[20:14:22] <brad1121> any user who notices or has a clue, knows they can just edit the DOM anyway
[20:14:44] <gtristan> So I have a <div> which acts like a button and accepts focus and keynav by setting tabindex="0" on it, but the button thing has a disabled state, so I'm wondering what jquery API I should use
[20:15:05] <gtristan> should I use .prop ('tabindex', 0) to enable it, and .removeProp ('tabindex') to disable it ?
[20:15:27] <gtristan> the .removeProp() API docs say scary things, like it will remove completely and shouldnt be used
[20:15:44] <brad1121> gtristan, im not 100% sure what your trying to do
[20:16:09] <gtristan> brad1121, programatically set/unset the tabindex="0" attribute of a <div>
[20:16:24] <gtristan> so that it cannot be tabbed into while in a disabled state
[20:16:42] <brad1121> just use removeAttr('tabindex')
[20:17:05] <gtristan> so treat it as an attribute and not a property, ok I'll go with that
[20:44:36] <zeroquake> what is efficient way to add/remove class on large amounts of nodes at same time?
[20:47:07] <apb1963> what are people using for fancy tables?  I'm trying jtable, but not having much luck with it.  So if there's something nice out there, I'm all ears.
[20:48:51] <brad1121> apb1963 datatables.net
[20:49:40] <brad1121> zeroquake $('selector').addClass('my class');  $('selector').removeClass('my class'); ????
[20:49:54] <apb1963> brad1121: that a microsoft thing?
[20:50:01] <brad1121> nope
[20:50:04] <brad1121> jquery tables
[20:50:14] <brad1121> ive used it for quite a few production sites
[20:50:28] <zeroquake> yah , say i have 1000 nodes , does the page get repainted on adding a class if style changes?
[20:50:51] <brad1121> yes zero
[20:51:56] <zeroquake> i have like 1000 - 2000 google card like ui
[20:52:13] <brad1121> provided the css is already loaded, shouldnt be an issue
[20:52:13] <zeroquake> paint times are around 1.5 to 2.5 seconds
[20:52:24] <zeroquake> yes , is there i can repaint only once?
[20:52:27] <brad1121> lazy load the css changes?
[20:52:28] <zeroquake> way
[20:52:45] <brad1121> only add the class to the elements in the windows view
[20:52:54] <zeroquake> yes
[20:53:22] <zeroquake> card-show --> makes a card visible once i hide all the cards
[20:53:34] <zeroquake> everytime i add this class , the page repaints?
[20:53:45] <zeroquake> the css is already loaded
[20:54:05] <brad1121> yea, give me a sec ill js fiddle
[20:55:41] <apb1963> datatables looks pretty nice, but it also looks a lot more complex than jtable.
[20:59:45] <brad1121> zeroquake
[20:59:46] <brad1121> https://jsfiddle.net/ue059jfn/3/
[21:00:05] <brad1121> apb1963 its a little hard to get your head around at first, but it can do alot
[21:00:13] <brad1121> google also have their own JS tables
[21:00:53] <brad1121> https://developers.google.com/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/table
[21:05:31] <zeroquake> brad1121 http://jsfiddle.net/sfjpc9t6/
[21:06:14] <zeroquake> that is what i current do , my question is every i change the class of a card , does the page get repainted ? or is browser smart enough to repaint only once
[21:06:35] <zeroquake> http://jsfiddle.net/sfjpc9t6/#&togetherjs=4TrocUN3G7
[21:06:50] <tdignan> zeroquake: implementation dependent on the browser. most likely only redraws the area that it needs to.
[21:07:05] <brad1121> ^^ this
[21:08:00] <zeroquake> ok , next question ..is there a better way to do this , repaint times are most expensive in this case.
[21:08:21] <brad1121> only redraw the ones in view
[21:08:40] <brad1121> only add the class as the user scrolls
[21:09:12] <brad1121> get the window height and add enough space to add the class just before it comes into the window
[21:11:27] <zeroquake> this implementation is used to show matching search results , do i need to calculate how many cards fit in and then add the class to it , isn't it a bit of overkill?
[21:11:54] <brad1121> you dont really need to work out how many fit i dont think
[21:11:56] <tdignan> zeroquake: sounds like maybe implementing pagination could work
[21:12:07] <tdignan> if you had 10000 cards would you want to display all 10k? probably not.
[21:12:14] <zeroquake> true
[21:12:23] <brad1121> have a div which is your view point
[21:13:02] <brad1121> add .show_cards as it comes into that view point.
[21:13:03] <zeroquake> any good tutorial links on pagination ?
[21:13:15] <brad1121> or just do pagination like everyone else
[21:13:35] <zeroquake> brad1121 any example code on solution you are refering to ?
[21:14:00] <brad1121> kinda just made it up, ill see if i can edit your jsfiddle quick enough
[21:14:17] <zeroquake> am gona try cloning nodes and see if thats viable
[21:17:37] <tdignan> man you could probably also just find a listview widget already written that could be used.
[21:41:17] <brad1121> zeroquake do paging, it gets to laggy too quick. unless you can break every 10-20 results into sub groups, and sub sub groups as you get more results
[21:41:27] <brad1121> but at that point, its over kill for sure
[21:41:52] <zeroquake> cloning is also slow.
[21:42:04] <zeroquake> it is best to stick with add/remove classes
[21:57:02] <hiteshtr> does on() bind again to element if the dom containing that element reloads ?
[21:57:22] <hiteshtr> not whole page refresh
