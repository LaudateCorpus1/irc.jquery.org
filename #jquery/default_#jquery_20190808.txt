[09:13:38] <codecutter> instead of showing the second paragram i'd like to add elipses on the blank line '...' https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/b3vsf5jz/4/
[09:13:50] <codecutter> paragraph*
[09:14:20] <codecutter> not sure if this is a css or a js issue
[09:15:23] <codecutter> e.g. add ... on the forst blank line
[09:15:28] <codecutter> first*
[09:18:13] <vish93> codecutter: https://codepen.io/natonischuk/pen/mJOdmJ something like this
[09:19:07] <codecutter> no quite, like this https://jsfiddle.net/apprentice_/b3vsf5jz/6/
[09:20:02] <codecutter> only show the first paragram with elipses if there is any more text
[09:20:09] <codecutter> paragraph*
[09:30:28] <oki79> what would jquery "$("#form").alpaca({..." be in JS?
[09:30:39] <oki79> I tried " document.querySelector(".field1").alpaca( {...", but it doesn't seem to work
[09:32:08] <vish93> oki79: Why do you want to use native js on a Jquery dependant method?
[09:32:27] <oki79> I'm curious if it's possible to use JS
[09:36:21] <vish93> Alpaca Forms needs Jquery so I would say that is a solid no go
