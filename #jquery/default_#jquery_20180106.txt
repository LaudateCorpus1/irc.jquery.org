[00:40:44] <senaps> How would i append two list of dictionaries in jquery? https://jsfiddle.net/7hn63p7w/ i want them to be flat like the ending example. i know i could use a for loop, but it's expensive for me, is there an easier way to do this?
[06:02:07] <pastebin> https://jsfiddle.net/rLsg58az/5/ I've been trying almost everything. Not sure what im doing wrong. I get Uncaught ReferenceError: input is not defined on this row: var systemtyp = input.systemtyp;
[06:02:43] <Woet> pastebin: as it says, input is not defined. what is unclear?
[06:03:41] <pastebin> Woet - That part isn't unclear, obviously as it's stated in the console. But how can i define it then?
[06:03:52] <Woet> pastebin: what do you want "input" to be?
[06:04:36] <pastebin> I want input.systemtyp to be the value that is passed from the radio button
[06:04:54] <pastebin> name="systemtyp" value="360hls"
[06:04:56] <Woet> pastebin: so which docs told you that "input.systemtyp" is the way to reference that?
[06:05:07] <pastebin> I got that help from the Javascript channel
[06:10:17] <senaps> why isn't my code to remove an object from the array only if it exists, doesn't work? https://jsfiddle.net/98m4jxcn/
[06:10:44] <senaps> this either removes first object, or does nothing and returns the whole list.
[06:18:07] <Woet> pastebin: it's incorrect, I recommend googling and reading more documentation on how to reference objects and get their values
[06:18:24] <Woet> senaps: what is your jQuery question?
[06:19:09] <senaps> nothing important. sorry wrong room.

[09:47:43] <bolovanos> checkbox changed with .change attached function is not being activated when state of checkbox is change with .prop (all jquery) http://plnkr.co/edit/XGFtr7QBJo6Bhgi4LwL
[09:47:55] <bolovanos> what should I do to change state of checkbox with activation .change function at the same time?
[09:56:56] <thykka> bolovanos, .trigger('change') ?¨
[10:07:42] <bolovanos> thykka, hi, thank you - $('#radio1').trigger('click');
[10:07:42] <bolovanos>  vs $('#radio1').click(); - both works the same way (triggers changes), do yo know why it is not working when prop is used?
[10:09:17] <thykka> changing props doesn't generally trigger events.
[10:12:38] <jak2000> hi all
[10:12:53] <bolovanos> I was looking for this information in spec, but maybe overlooked it. Is it there? http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[11:47:40] <thykka> no, it's here https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/indices.html#event-change
[11:47:55] <thykka> > Fired at controls when the *user* commits a value change
[11:48:11] <thykka> also https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/change#Description
[12:40:51] <bolovanos> thykka, thank you again, have a nice day!

[12:54:58] <andi> Hello I'm getting "TypeError: $ is undefined" when I enable to bootstrap-editable module. The error happens in this line: $.fn.editableform = function (option) {
[12:55:41] <andi> The system I use is laravel, I installed jquery and the bootstrap-editable via npm and included all that stuff in the webpack.mix.js.
[13:07:42] <thykka> jquery isn't loaded
[13:07:50] <thykka> not at that point anyway
[13:24:09] <andi> jquery is loaded and it was loaded before.
[13:24:39] <andi> I found the error, the bootstrap.js needs to be loaded before the x-editable js file, then it's working fine.
[13:25:07] <andi> I found all over the net that jquery is not loaded correctly or loaded twice or loaded in a wrong variable.
[13:28:51] <thykka> right, so jquery wasn't loaded at that point :)
[13:36:28] <andi> jquery was loaded before, because the jquery-datepicker didn't throw the error, but was loaded in a similar way. It looked like the x-editable package uses anything of the bootstrap.js stuff.
