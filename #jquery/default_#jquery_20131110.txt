[00:41:54] <aditsu> hi, what's a good replacement for facebox, that works directly with jquery 1.10? ideally it should look and work almost the same; I'm using it with ajax pages
[00:44:02] <aditsu> (and btw it doesn't look right on the facebox site :p )
[00:52:23] <aditsu> oh wait, I think it actually works
[00:53:22] <aditsu> there's another plugin that fails..
[01:26:47] <rabbi1> can i use something like "$(this).previousElementSibling.addClass('hidden');"
[01:30:19] <pixelpimp> !api prev @ rabbi1
[01:30:24] <b-ot> rabbi1: .prev(): Get the immediately preceding sibling of each element in the set of matched elements, optionally filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/prev/
[01:31:18] <rabbi1> pixelpimp: yeap i know but it's not adding the class ...
[01:31:57] <pixelpimp> then you're doing it wrong.
[01:33:35] <rabbi1> $(this).prev().hide(); i am trying to hide the previous sibling ….
[01:36:42] <rabbi1> pixelpimp: sh*t i am putting it in a different method …. shame on me … :)
[01:36:53] <pixelpimp> there you go
[01:36:59] <pixelpimp> your line is very correct
[01:43:54] <rabbi1> pixelpimp: i am using bootstrap, any way i can change the collapse to transit from right to left instead bottom to top ?
[01:45:03] <pixelpimp> why are you asking me?
[01:45:20] <rabbi1> if u know…
[01:45:22] <rabbi1> else np
[01:45:30] <pixelpimp> but you singled out me, and no one else
[01:45:36] <pixelpimp> this is a channel with 770 people other than me
[01:48:00] <rabbi1> o ok…..
[02:37:25] <Guest___> hay all. Looking for plugin for resizable table columns
[02:37:52] <sammych2> http://dobtco.github.io/jquery-resizable-columns/
[02:38:26] <sammych2> and a column sorter
[02:38:32] <sammych2> http://tablesorter.com/docs/
[02:39:00] <sammych2> those are the ones I've found. Just seeing if those are what people are using, or if there are better
[02:41:02] <sammych2> also, I'm looking for pagination
[02:42:02] <sammych2> would it be alright to just display:none the rows or should I actually change the data in the existing cells?
[02:45:39] <guzaarish> hi
[03:00:50] <sammych2> okay, apparently what I want is FooTable2
[03:34:17] <ShawnRisk> Two Issues, if you go to ecosanity.org and hover over the thumbnails in the slideshow and move the mouse in and out, does the image stay as the slide?  I want image before to stay up if the thumbnail is not clicked. code: http://pastebin.com/kG0h3vGi
[03:36:09] <ShawnRisk> Other question is that if you search for ecosanity.org on google does the slideshow cycle?  Someone says with these settings: windows 7, firefox 25.0 orIE 10.0.9200.16721, this does but not for me.  Any ideas?
[03:51:46] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts on my question?
[03:56:03] <grafi> doesnt cycle for me
[03:56:17] <grafi> win7, ff 27
[03:58:19] <ShawnRisk> grafi: okay, what about other question?
[03:59:55] <grafi> that does work
[04:01:29] <ShawnRisk> grafi: meaning?
[04:04:06] <grafi> that it works?
[04:04:07] <grafi> oô
[04:06:59] <ShawnRisk> grafi: Can you test if you click on one of the thumbnails and then hover over another image and mouseout, does that image stay on top?  If so, I want the image I clicked to be showing off mouseout.
[04:08:07] <ShawnRisk> on*
[04:11:37] <ShawnRisk> ??
[04:19:13] <ShawnRisk> grafi: sorry for question of meaning as I was confused by what works and not works
[04:24:43] <jl2753> hey guys- i'm not sure how the syntax goes- could someone point me in the right direction? 	var finalSnap = ($(snap).countdownCounter({format : '%%H%%:%%M%%:%%S%%'}));   I'm trying to define a statement as a variable (snap is also a variable)
[04:31:08] <christophe_v_e> Hey I'm looking to create in input box in which some letters get switched automatically once typed. "th" would become "ht" and "ui" "iu" etc. How would I go about this?
[04:33:57] <ShawnRisk> grafi: still around?
[04:40:43] <ShawnRisk> seems very quiet now
[04:53:13] <ShawnRisk> If go to: ecosanity.org & you click on one of the thumbnails. Then hover over another image and mouseout, does that image stay on top? If so, I want the image I clicked to be showing off mouseout. code: http://pastebin.com/yDbf6AHc
[05:11:58] <ShawnRisk> seems no one is here
[05:13:10] <ShawnRisk> christophe_v_e: not sure how to do that but would be a neat thing
[05:13:25] <ShawnRisk> jl2753: confused what you want
[05:26:45] <ShawnRisk> well I am out for a bit
[07:20:39] <malorie> do you guys know of a way to add an inner zoom to a fancybox?
[07:20:55] <malorie> everything I've tried so far didn't really work :\
[07:33:14] <cjwelborn> can't get an answer on some other channels, i know this is a loaded question, but what javascript compressor do you prefer? (yui, closure, or something else)?
[07:39:46] <Dirkos> Anyone that can suggest a good multifile upload for jquery? This lib seems sooo "big" http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/
[07:44:22] <jobney> uploadifive
[07:49:38] <Dirkos> yeah but its not free jobney
[07:49:48] <Dirkos> and i dont see an option for previews when a file is uploaded?
[07:50:07] <jobney> its $5
[08:23:06] <iskaraltok> Is there a simple way to check if the value of an input type="text" .change()
[08:40:20] <joroci> iskaraltok
[08:40:35] <joroci> add the change event to the input element
[08:40:56] <iskaraltok> The field is not populated by user input it's a hidden field
[08:42:10] <joroci> you change it programmatically?
[08:42:48] <joroci> if so go like this
[08:42:57] <joroci> $("#input").val("value").change();
[08:43:12] <joroci> it will fire the event
[08:57:40] <Soltis> Is there a reasonably easy way to take a form and convert the inputs into a data structure?
[08:57:58] <Soltis> I.e. I can write such code myself, but I'd rather use an existing tool/feature
[09:20:04] <kpl> In firebug editor, if I do: $("#f #name input").prop("value") then I can read the value of a text input. If I do: var props=$("#f"); can I use props.children("#name input").prop("value"). Apparently not. props.children("#name").length is 1. How can I check which element that represents?
[09:21:41] <kpl> props.children("#name").length is 1. But props.children("#name input").length is 0.
[09:27:42] <kpl> I think I understand the problem: .children(selector) cannot access grandchildren using selector.
[10:44:54] <hatoon> hi
[10:44:59] <hatoon> everybod
[11:01:57] <logix812> with an event, I'm getting confused by the docs a tad. if I assign and event, say 'click' to an LI. That LI holds some kids. what will always be the LI e.target or e.currentTarget?  I think I want e.target. If I read it right e.currentTarget is as the event bubbles
[11:04:19] <jrajav> logix812: Other way around
[11:04:33] <logix812> ah!
[11:04:38] <jrajav> logix812: currentTarget is the element you assigned your click handler to, target is the one the event actually triggered on
[11:05:18] <logix812> jrajav: Thanks!
[11:05:33] <jrajav> You usually want target if you want either one, especially with jQuery, since it's pretty easy to maintain a reference to the element you're assigning the handler to rather than getting it back with event
[13:10:21] <relipse> i'm having trouble left-aligning a select box (that allows resizing), the text should show to the right see: http://jsfiddle.net/5KzGv/
[13:31:40] <speaker123> i have a <pre> environment with many <span> elements on each line. with a button click, i hide certain <span> elements.  but the newline after the span remains.  how can i hide the newline as well?
[13:39:45] <inthl> I've got a form with an onsubmit-event, like <form onsubmit="return foobar();"  ... but I want to disable this handling (the call of foobar) when a specific cancel-button is being pressed
[13:39:54] <inthl> any ideas how to accomplish this?
[13:41:05] <pixelpimp> check if it's that cancel button before returning foobar()
[13:41:27] <pixelpimp> if (isCancelButton) { return; } return foobar();
[13:41:55] <pixelpimp> alternatively, perhaps better: if (!isCancelButton) { return foobar(); }
[13:42:00] <inthl> ah. okay, but how to identify that button? it has an unique name  - since I need to know which one was pressed
[13:42:24] <pixelpimp> it probably has an ID, class, or attribute telling you that; just check for that
[13:42:44] <pixelpimp> !api hasclass @ inthl
[13:42:44] <b-ot> inthl: .hasClass(): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[13:43:17] <inthl> sure, but what I mean is how to process that check - how to know which button was pressed, since both (the OK button and the cancle button) are always shown
[13:43:55] <pixelpimp> ^- it probably has an ID, class, or attribute telling you that; just check for that
[13:51:30] <inthl> I don't get it. I see no way how to determine which of 2 buttons was pressed, even if it has unique attributes
[13:53:20] <pixelpimp> by checking those unique attributes
[13:54:13] <inthl> how, for example? both attributes always exist, ..is there some method for this to figure out which one caused the submission?
[13:55:21] <pixelpimp> i don't know what the differences are, it's your code, and i haven't seen it
[14:09:02] <cloudman> hello
[14:09:34] <cloudman> is there any function similar to "post" but that make me leave the current page
[14:09:36] <cloudman> ?
[14:10:03] <coldhead> window.location = '/some_other_page';
[14:10:10] <cloudman> I do mean, that I have to call a new page and then tranfert to it data with post method
[14:10:32] <coldhead> do a non-AJAX form submission
[14:10:41] <coldhead> $('form')[0].submit();
[14:11:09] <coldhead> what an age we live in, where people ask how to do POSTs withOUT AJAX
[14:11:14] <cloudman> any document please coldhead
[14:11:16] <cloudman> ?

[14:31:05] <benzrf> hi
[14:31:20] <benzrf> is there a reverse child selector?
[14:31:30] <benzrf> I.e. if i want to select all .foo with .bar children
[14:31:47] <benzrf> i know css does not support that, but does jquery?
[14:49:24] <soldoutactivist> benzrf
[14:49:35] <benzrf> yea?
[14:49:37] <soldoutactivist> benzrf $('.child').parents('.foo')
[14:49:42] <soldoutactivist> Sorry about the double tap
[14:49:53] <benzrf> dont mind
[14:50:09] <benzrf> will that work for when .foo is varying levels above .child
[14:50:19] <soldoutactivist> It should.
[14:50:24] <benzrf> ok, thanks :)
[14:50:30] <soldoutactivist> But I get the feeling it won't be everything you need.
[15:56:25] <lostkauze> anyone knows why this won't animate? it works without the setTimeout: setTimeout(
[15:56:25] <lostkauze> 		  function() {	
[15:56:25] <lostkauze> 		  $(this).animate({left:position.left - random,
[15:56:25] <lostkauze> 			top:position.top - randomm})}, 500);
[15:59:59] <pixelpimp> what's $(this) to the setTimeout?  not the same thing, likely.
[16:01:29] <lostkauze> that's probably the reason, but i'm not sure how to fix it
[16:05:26] <lostkauze> oh i think it works. i stored 'this' in another variable before going into the setTimeout and it appears to be working. thanks
[16:06:12] <modestkdr> Hello, in regards to performance, is there a difference between jQuery(span#someId) vs jQuery(#someId)
[16:07:00] <anli_> Is $.get impossible to use for other domains than the page that is loading?
[16:07:48] <coldhead> yes anli_
[16:07:59] <coldhead> it's for your own protection
[16:08:31] <anli_> Can I use a wilcard in the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header?
[16:14:34] <modestkdr> Hello, in regards to performance, is there a difference between jQuery(span#someId) vs jQuery(#someId)
[16:16:02] <pixelpimp> yes.  the former is marginally slower in that it checks if #someId is inside a span somewhere down the line
[16:16:28] <pixelpimp> doing this a lot could add up, especially on mobiles
[16:17:50] <shoky> anli_: i believe so
[16:21:17] <anli_> Can I start an app without the splash?
[16:21:22] <anli_> oops, wrong channel
[16:39:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> anil_: lol
[16:40:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> pixelpimp: but would the latter not be faster as it looks for all spans then looks for relevent id or class
[16:40:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> instead of former which looks through all elements
[16:41:49] <shoky> Rohan_Bhangui:  $('#someId')  doesn't look through any elements, it's super fast
[16:42:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> hows it work then
[16:42:25] <shoky> the browser keeps a hashmap of ids to elements. access to a hashmap is super fast ;p
[16:45:04] <shoky> super fast being O(1) i.e. constant time
[16:45:12] <pixelpimp> Rohan_Bhangui: selectors also read from right to left, so it finds it, then extraneously looks for a span in its parents
[16:45:31] <shoky> well that would be "span #someId" not "span#someId"
[16:46:05] <shoky> doesn't matter much, cause "span#someId" is also slower
[16:46:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> pixelpimp: why does it not read the toher way
[16:48:15] <pixelpimp> oh yeah.  either way slow for sure though :)
[16:48:34] <pixelpimp> it reads right->left because it's more efficient
[16:50:21] <relipse>  does anyone know how to align the the div to the left, ie; <div><div class="align left">...</div><div>content shown on right</div></div> ?
[17:00:25] <tw2113> text-align: left;
[17:36:18] <Cecchi> anyone have an idea what might be causing .animate() to jump when i animate a div from 30% width to 30% width
[17:36:55] <Cecchi> its absolutely positioned, but actually regardless of what percentage i start at it jumps to above 100% and then animates down to the target percentage width
[17:40:12] <Cecchi> using v1.10, demo here: http://jsfiddle.net/UgVVx/
[17:40:49] <Cecchi> something to do with max-width, I guess
[18:45:36] <coldhead> lol wildcard

[18:49:11] <coldhead> shy and, i suspect, drunk
[18:49:18] <abjorn> what
[18:49:21] <abjorn> why would I be drunk
[18:49:28] <abjorn> also: how did you know?
[18:49:29] <Velveeta> why would you not be drunk?
[18:49:45] <abjorn> I can't think of an answer to that
[18:49:52] <jennmoneydollars> abjorn is drunk on jquery
[18:49:55] <jennmoneydollars> this is a jquery room right
[18:49:59] <abjorn> i think so
[18:50:08] <coldhead> theres the jQuery sign over the door
[18:50:25] <Velveeta> is this a jake weary room? http://i.imgur.com/sXSwqcf.png
[18:50:33] <abjorn> this is where we teach coldhead jquery
[18:50:47] <coldhead> you're not doing a very good job of it
[18:50:54] <coldhead> i haven't learned a fucking thing
[18:50:54] <jennmoneydollars> abjorn, he certainly needs it. i'm tired of talking to him in actual english
[18:50:57] <abjorn> to be fair, I'm always drunk
[18:51:23] <abjorn> I don't know if I'd call it english
[18:51:27] <abjorn> bush speak, more like
[18:51:37] <coldhead> crikey, that's a bit racist bruce
[18:51:42] <abjorn> is it?
[18:51:42] <jennmoneydollars> wow man
[18:51:45] <abjorn> I'm not reall ysure
[18:51:59] <jennmoneydollars> abjorn needs to check his privilege
[18:52:08] <abjorn> I don't know the ins and outs of this whole australian thing
[18:52:45] <abjorn> I blame it on being raised in texas
[18:53:02] <Velveeta> so when you said bush speak, did you mean like misunderestimating people?
[18:53:14] <abjorn> i...what?
[18:53:22] <coldhead> different bush
[18:53:26] <abjorn> oh
[18:53:29] <abjorn> rofl
[18:53:31] <coldhead> you certainly offended poor jenn
[18:53:48] <coldhead> she used to work in an outback steakhouse
[18:53:52] <coldhead> so she takes it personal
[18:53:54] <abjorn> oh my god I had no idea
[18:54:09] <abjorn> I would have never said that had I known
[18:54:24] <jennmoneydollars> sorry that was rude of me, I meant to say good bye
[18:54:28] <abjorn> oh, okay
[18:54:28] <jennmoneydollars> good bye
[18:55:04] <coldhead> inside she's crying
[18:55:10] <coldhead> also she has severe diarrea
[18:55:22] <abjorn> are the two related or did you just want to point out the extent of her plight?
[18:55:35] <coldhead> i just mean
[18:55:42] <coldhead> you can't tell how someone feels on the inside
[18:56:12] <abjorn> I don't know how to take this
[18:56:21] <abjorn> My mind is in shambles
[18:56:29] <nexxy> O_o
[18:56:30] <coldhead> you can never really come to terms with it
[18:56:34] <coldhead> you just have to be kind
[18:56:39] <rhalff> hi what events can I use with jquery to act on dragging? I do not want to drag a window, but just listen to the mouse drag events
[18:56:51] <rhalff> or will I need a special plugin
[18:56:52] <coldhead> because the brave face someone puts up to the world may mask a terrible loose poop secret
[18:57:52] <abjorn> rhalff: It does take a plugin. There's a bit in jQuery UI for that
[18:58:45] <rhalff> abjorn, nevermind just found more than I wished for :-)
[18:58:53] <abjorn> lol werd
[18:58:56] <rhalff> http://codecanyon.net/item/jquery-dragpan/full_screen_preview/2976847
[18:59:13] <rhalff> oh have to buy it :( :)
[18:59:38] <coldhead> here's a nickel
[19:00:38] <rhalff> ah bower has something similar, thanks for the nickel anyway
[19:03:21] <abjorn> it's an australian nickel so you might have trouble spending it
[19:23:59] <abjorn> whelp, back to coding
[19:30:43] <nafta> how can I get only the text returned on data? I'm trying to do .done(function(data) { var newRank = data; }); but that returns this -> <div class=\"header-rank\">MyRank</div>
[19:43:16] <unnu> question
[19:44:25] <unnu> http://jsbin.com/iXOjilI/6/edit <-- im not sure what i did wrong
[19:52:36] <ahughes> sorry, noob question... <div class="sharelink-container"/> and click does not work...   $("sharelink-container").click(function(){window.alert("boo"));
[19:52:47] <ahughes> why so?
[19:55:57] <unnu> its a class ahughes
[19:56:11] <ahughes> just found that :) idiot me
[19:56:14] <unnu> $(".sharelink-container").click
[19:56:16] <unnu> okay
[19:56:16] <unnu> :D
[19:56:19] <unnu> also
[19:56:26] <unnu> i hate to be particular
[19:56:31] <ahughes> do it!
[19:56:35] <unnu> but .on('click' is awesome
[19:56:45] <unnu> mostly because of AJAX
[19:57:35] <unnu> you can do cool stuff like $('body').on("click", "#ajaxContainer", function(e){ alert('yay');});
[20:00:08] <unnu> ahuges, whatcha working on if you dont mind me asking?
[20:02:12] <kborchers> unnu: something more like this is probably what you're looking for http://jsbin.com/iXOjilI/7/edit
[20:03:13] <unnu> was actually doing it as a test
[20:03:32] <unnu> now i gotta do the ajax
[20:03:34] <kborchers> your main issue was using closest instead of find since closest searches ancestors and find searches descendants. you could probably use children instead of find too if that structure won't change
[20:03:49] <unnu> but i see what you did there :)
[20:03:52] <unnu> yeah
[20:03:55] <unnu> thanks kborchers
[20:03:57] <kborchers> np
[20:04:07] <unnu> i always get closest and find find mixed up
[20:07:24] <velus> hello i have a file that uses  parsley.js and bootstrap but how would i get the error message to show to the side and ot srew up the template i have?
[20:08:14] <velus> also how can i get jquery to check a persons age from there dob
[20:15:22] <mouses> my website
[20:15:35] <unnu> kborchers, you still around?
[20:15:44] <mouses> my site's page width is 980px. should it be greater nowadays?
[20:16:34] <mouses> i'm thinking of making it like 1250px or something
[20:16:37] <kborchers> unnu: working and lurking ;) so kind of around
[20:17:02] <mouses> most displays are at least 1280x720 nowadays, right?
[20:17:13] <mouses> shit, even mobile phones
[20:17:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> mouses: you can work off a 1200px grid
[20:17:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> because anything below that is pretty much mobile
[20:18:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> (a few exceptions like galaxy phnes that have 1280*800 but for the most part your clear at 1200px)
[20:18:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> nafta: you still working?
[20:18:40] <mouses> hmm
[20:18:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: you still up
[20:18:52] <Velveeta> yep
[20:18:58] <Velveeta> workin on a slideshow
[20:19:02] <mouses> yeah i think i could use the screen real estate and bump up to 1200px
[20:19:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> jquery
[20:19:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> or keynoters or something
[20:19:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> mouses: ideally you want to create fully responsive
[20:19:28] <mouses> my monitor is 2560x1440 and i usually have a browser open taking up half the screen
[20:19:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[20:19:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> my screen is neraly half that
[20:20:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> im sitting pretty on a 1920*1080
[20:20:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> what you want to do by limiting to 1200
[20:20:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> is create background gutters along left and right sides
[20:21:14] <mouses> Rohan_Bhangui: yeah but my design isnt ideal for responsive because i use a lot of scrolling thumbnail animations that would cause the js math to be overkill to predict how much to scroll based on current width etc
[20:21:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> scrolling thumbnails?
[20:21:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: btw i found the secret sauce to having great phonegap apps
[20:22:11] <Velveeta> oh yeah?
[20:22:35] <mouses> its a personal website w/ embedded video and thumbnail images for each video. about 4 thumbnails are showing at a time at 980px page width
[20:23:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: its basically phonegap + steroidsjs + iscroll4 (i am using iscroll 5 beta) + your own stylesheet = perfect phomegap app
[20:23:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh and a little magic from either hammer.js or something similar
[20:23:34] <Velveeta> sounds like a lot of overhead
[20:23:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: was that for me or mouses
[20:24:28] <Velveeta> rohan: that was for you
[20:24:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: the only thing left to test is how it will hold out on animation but for now i have long text and it seems to respond well
[20:25:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: here is the iscroll 5 beta github
[20:25:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> https://github.com/cubiq/iscroll
[20:25:18] <Velveeta> can't look right now, i gotta wrap up this presentation
[20:25:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol when you get the time
[20:25:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> its actually working really well
[20:26:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> mouses: then I guess
[20:26:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> you could leave it at 1200px
[20:26:24] <Velveeta> rohan: how big is that bundle of assets all together?
[20:26:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: the script itself or my project?
[20:27:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> the script is 44kb
[20:27:24] <Velveeta> the base set of library scripts, phonegap + steroids + iscroll + your stylesheet
[20:27:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> umm let me check
[20:27:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause i have alot of extra stuff in there that i dont use
[20:28:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: fuck
[20:28:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> its like 15.6mb
[20:28:43] <Velveeta> jesus, that can't be right
[20:28:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> my www folder is half or that
[20:28:58] <Velveeta> is that as a phone app or as a web app?
[20:29:01] <mouses> is it true that most monitors are 8-bit? i'm a filmmaker and when i read color grading articles, they all say to go for a 10-bit monitor
[20:29:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> phoneapp
[20:29:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: i figured it out
[20:29:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> i am loading fonts locally
[20:29:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> so the fonts are like 5 mb
[20:30:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> so really the project is just 2 mb
[20:30:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> the www
[20:30:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> folder
[20:30:16] <Velveeta> yeah as a phone app that's not too bad
[20:30:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> the enitre project is like 10 mb
[20:30:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> too bad phonegap and steroids only supports static splash screens :(
[20:32:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: but app is quite responsive
[20:33:04] <Velveeta> that's good to hear
[20:34:02] <Velveeta> have you seen the video by burke holland that was done during the jquery conference in austin, where they gave devs 2 different apps to play with and see if they could figure out which one was hybrid and which was a web app?
[20:34:29] <Velveeta> http://www.kendoui.com/appchallenge.aspx
[20:34:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> i gotta see this
[20:34:49] <ShawnRisk> If go to: ecosanity.org & you click on one of the thumbnails. Then hover over another image and mouseout, does that image stay on top? If so, I want the image I clicked to be showing off mouseout. Code: http://pastebin.com/hC6mBa5t
[20:35:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> i wanna attend oen of these one day
[20:35:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: do they have one in toronto?
[20:35:45] <Velveeta> i love going to these kinds of conferences, you get a nice wide variety of info
[20:36:03] <Velveeta> not sure, you should just do a search for toronto javascript conferences
[20:36:05] <Rohan_Bhangui> its not about that....its just jquery is widely used now
[20:36:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta:

[20:38:08] <Velveeta> those are 3 powerhouses
[20:38:21] <Velveeta> and i can't even imagine the rest of the brains in that lineup
[20:38:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> oh wait that is last years
[20:38:48] <Rohan_Bhangui> ill have to wait for this years
[20:38:49] <ShawnRisk> :?
[20:38:53] <Velveeta> oh, well then
[20:39:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> but still we will get those guys back i assume
[20:39:03] <Velveeta> shawnrisk: sorry, let me take a look
[20:39:51] <abjorn> man im jealous of toronto
[20:40:01] <abjorn> not because of that, i just wish my mayor did crack
[20:40:18] <Velveeta> lol
[20:41:23] <coldhead> you can't be sure he doesn't, abjorn
[20:41:34] <abjorn> Well, that's true
[20:44:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta: is kendo worth looking into
[20:44:26] <ShawnRisk> who is from Toronto?
[20:45:19] <pixelpimp> canadians
[20:45:54] <coldhead> vladikoff is
[20:46:08] <coldhead> kendo is nice if you like paying for things
[20:46:18] <coldhead> they give away a lot of free stuff at conferences at least
[20:46:25] <coldhead> that's where your $$ goes
[20:48:14] <abjorn> i refuse to believe vladikoff is not from siberia
[20:49:22] <coldhead> he's from little siberia, it's a neighbourhood in toronto
[20:52:50] <ShawnRisk> any thoughts?
[20:58:30] <ShawnRisk> Velveeta: ^
[20:58:35] <LckyBy517> i'm back for more help!
[20:59:02] <Velveeta> sorry, i got sidetracked by some work i have to wrap up tonight, i'm gonna step aside and let someone else take a look at it
[20:59:04] <LckyBy517> this one seems rather simple but its making me mad :(
[20:59:13] <LckyBy517> actually i set that aside entirely for the moment
[21:00:02] <LckyBy517> i've got a div - <div class="status_red" id="server_status">Minecraft Server</div> and in my javascript when i do this - alert($("server_status").attr("class")); i'm getting the alert but it just says undefined
[21:00:25] <LckyBy517> called in $(document).ready() so i know the DOM is loaded
[21:02:18] <Fernandos> hi
[21:03:13] <Fernandos> What do you suggest for rapid prototyping? Using a prototyping tool or just writing the UI and minimum behaviour using something like the bootstrap or semantic framework?
[21:03:22] <LckyBy517> no idea how i did it but i removed my # on the selctor somehow and didn't even realize it haha
[21:10:44] <vladikoff> abjorn, coldhead , lol
[21:11:02] <abjorn> sup
[21:11:27] <abjorn> i mean, i suppose if vladikoff really was in siberia then his mayor would be addicted to krokodil instead of crack
[21:14:53] <ahughes> anyone seen jquery -> bitly working?
[21:15:06] <ahughes> need to shorten my links
[22:11:19] <bowenac> Curious if someone can give a suggestion or know how...
[22:11:28] <bowenac> http://jsfiddle.net/bowenac/3RcNM/
[22:12:19] <bowenac> I am using jQuery to trigger a loading.gif but I'm also using required feilds. I do not want to show the loading.gif if a required feild was triggered. Anyone got any ideas how to tell if a required feild was triggered.
[22:12:36] <bowenac> Maybe check the vals on click before showing the loading
[22:30:30] <bowenac> that worked
[22:30:31] <bowenac> thanks
[22:54:16] <mephux> does anyone know how to bind a scroll event globally to document.. like     $(document).on('scroll', this.selector, function(e) {
[22:54:26] <mephux> any to make it bubble up
[22:59:32] <jop008> Is it posible to reach the callee data?
[22:59:56] <jop008> find out which is the caller of the function and see some variables
[23:00:18] <frothnicator> Is there a canonical method to have jQuery download a file?  I'd like the interaction to be that a user pushes a button (not an anchor tag), perform some last minute customizations, and then request the file from the server.  The obvious $('<a>' ... ).click() doesn't appear to work.
[23:16:51] <jop008> when I check the value of a date field it contains 0064-02-23 so the age is missing running Crhome OS
[23:16:54] <jop008> x
