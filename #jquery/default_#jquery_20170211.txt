[00:00:52] <aiena> ar1a, seems to fail i need to enclose that function inside an anonymous function
[00:01:03] <aiena> https://jsfiddle.net/1c50L1tm/
[00:01:05] <aiena> why
[00:04:39] <aiena> my JS skills are not good. Wondering how this anonymous function thing works really
[00:15:39] <aiena> anyway thank you
[00:15:41] <aiena> bye
[05:29:26] <archer121> hi. I want to hide the "Up Next" pane in youtube using jQuery. I do `$("#watch7-sidebar").hide()` in my google chrome console, but I get this error: "Uncaught TypeError: $(...).hide is not a function" what could be happening?
[05:30:15] <archer121> My theory is that youtube uses a verion of jQuery which does not have hide() implemented. Is it like that?
[05:30:51] <archer121> Or is it another silly mistake from my side? (as it usually turns out to be)
[05:44:46] <easyOnMe> hello I need some help with my jquery code
[05:44:48] <easyOnMe> http://pastebin.com/Q1zmyYMn
[05:45:59] <easyOnMe> what I want to achieve is to make the out event to decrease the variable only when an object has been dropped and not decrease when the object just happen to pass by the draggable area when the user drags a particular class belonging the the droppable area
[06:25:59] <ar1a> this chat is kinda dead huh :(
[07:04:28] <iaj> Hey folks!
[07:04:44] <iaj> Hi there :) Can someone maybe lend me a hand, is there a good eye-candyish way existing for showing all results sets from a database on a webpage, like with search/filter and stuff?
[07:06:32] <portfosh> check out datatables
[07:06:46] <portfosh> datatables.net i think
[07:20:13] <iaj> portfosh: ah yeah that seems decent thanks!
[08:06:44] <Sangeet> not sure why
[08:07:00] <Sangeet> but i am not able to print innerhtml of the <p> tag
[08:07:04] <Sangeet> any help?
[08:20:20] <codecutter> Can you guys see the html for this or is it my browser? https://jsfiddle.net/gh/get/library/pure/highcharts/highcharts/tree/master/samples/stock/demo/candlestick-and-volume/
[08:21:54] <Woet> codecutter: you cant load JSON like that
[08:22:01] <Woet> (on jsfiddle)
[08:22:14] <codecutter> well it not my code
[08:22:40] <codecutter> got it from here http://www.highcharts.com/stock/demo/candlestick-and-volume
[08:22:57] <codecutter> i'll create a local file instead
[08:23:19] <Woet> weird, its working now
[08:36:31] <codecutter> Woet: why i'm i unable to see the html inside the jsfiddle (see link below chart) http://www.highcharts.com/stock/demo/candlestick-and-volume
[08:39:53] <codecutter> why i'm i unable to see the html inside the jsfiddle (see link below chart) http://www.highcharts.com/stock/demo/candlestick-and-volume
[08:40:32] <soahccc> Does one know about a library that can do shellsplit? That is parsing a string into arguments as a shell would do it
[08:41:54] <soahccc> I suppose I could port the regex based solution from Ruby but I rather use something existing :D
[08:54:59] <aiena> what is the jquery equivalent of  "document.getElementById("someId") !== null"
[08:55:29] <aiena> i know it will be $("#someId") something most likely
[08:56:26] <codecutter> if($(document).find('someId').length)?
[09:00:27] <aiena> hmm I think the pure JS is more semantic will stick with that. SOme people suggested creating an exists() function but that sounds yuck and unportable
[09:00:50] <aiena> interesting discussion http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31044/is-there-an-exists-function-for-jquery
[09:00:54] <aiena> thanks codecutter
[09:01:25] <codecutter> alena: was it what you wanted?
[09:02:00] <aiena> codecutter, yes your right that is the jquery equivalent
[09:02:16] <aiena> but after knowing what it is I think i will stick with the JS
[09:02:37] <aiena> codecutter, how do i negate has class
[09:03:14] <codecutter> not sure what you mean, let me see the js
[09:04:54] <aiena> in an if statement suppose i do `if (condition1 && !$("#someId").hasClass("someclass")) {do_something; }` will mean if 'condition1' is satisfied and id does not have class "someclass" do something ? Am i right ?
[09:05:42] <aiena> codecutter,  as to your other question  "document.getElementById("someId") !== null" is more clear to determine is something does not exists vs "($(document).find('someId').length"
[09:05:48] <aiena> *if
[09:05:53] <codecutter> yes, && means both condition have to be met
[09:06:15] <aiena> and that ! will be evaluated first and then the && evaluated
[09:07:02] <altcoinfactory> Hi all
[09:07:20] <codecutter> '&&' means condition1 and condition2 are met, '||' means either
[09:07:55] <aiena> codecutter,  each condition is evaluated individually prior to evaluating the && condition ?
[09:08:01] <altcoinfactory> I'm here to ask help for a script....i cannot make it work on my wordpress site...anyone?
[09:08:27] <aiena> altcoinfactory, maybe ask in #javascript if it is more general javascript
[09:08:44] <codecutter> oh, this will be first !$("#someId").hasClass("someclass")
[09:08:59] <altcoinfactory> The script is Jquery i think https://github.com/webtechfreaky/Cloud-Pricing-Slider
[09:09:07] <codecutter> then and '&&'
[09:09:19] <codecutter> actually i'm not sure about that
[09:09:28] <codecutter> try it and see
[09:09:45] <aiena> altcoinfactory, hmm yes that is bootstrap which in turn uses jquery
[09:10:25] <altcoinfactory> aiena, then thats the wrong place or you can help me in something?
[09:10:40] <aiena> altcoinfactory, ask here
[09:10:54] <aiena> i might not be able to help but others can if i can't
[09:11:05] <aiena> if you dont get asnwers here ask in #javascript too
[09:11:24] <aiena> *I
[09:11:30] <altcoinfactory> Ok amazing...so, i have this free script that i would to make it work on my wordpress website
[09:12:27] <altcoinfactory> yesterday i've tried to insert the code in the file functions.php of the theme as described in the documentation, but didn't works
[09:13:37] <altcoinfactory> then i'm not sure of doing things good
[09:13:45] <altcoinfactory> as i cannot find help in what i'm wrong
[09:18:03] <altcoinfactory> what i did was enqueue the script on the file php with  using wp_enqueue_script() and wp_enqueue_style()
[09:18:08] <altcoinfactory> but didn't works :(
[09:24:31] <altcoinfactory> Is there anyone that can give me support on that please?
[09:27:03] <codecutter> how can I convert this into json? https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts/blob/master/samples/data/aapl-ohlc.json
[09:35:56] <decx> an array is already valid json
[09:41:32] <ar1a> so whats jqueryui and jquerymobile
[09:41:35] <ar1a> is it like bootstrap?
[09:47:48] <codecutter> decx: i seem to be getting an error on that file
[09:48:33] <codecutter> status: parsererror error: SyntaxError: Unexpected token / in JSON at position 0....
[09:49:15] <decx> arrays are valid
[09:49:20] <decx> comments are not
[09:50:13] <codecutter> just realised that. File it pretty long do you know the regex to remove those commented lines?
[09:50:59] <decx> do a /* */ capture group and replace it
[09:51:25] <altcoinfactory> anyone can help me on configure my fle functions.php to enqueue a jquery script?
[09:51:36] <decx> join ##wordpress
[09:53:05] <codecutter> '/* */' is not sufficientm it ignores the text
[09:53:20] <codecutter> sufficient*
[09:56:46] <sillyslux> yourString.replace(/\/\*.+\*\//g,'')
[09:59:05] <codecutter> got it
[09:59:06] <codecutter> thx
[10:00:05] <cannap> ar1a no
[10:00:16] <ar1a> then what
[10:00:29] <cannap> jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects, widgets, and themes built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library.
[10:00:33] <cannap> just read! :D
[10:01:43] <cannap> and juqerymobile.. no idea i never used
[10:02:13] <cannap> there is bootstrap.native https://github.com/thednp/bootstrap.native/ then you dont need jquery
[10:24:55] <ar1a> is there even any reason to use react or angular when theres jquery that is a lot less effor
[10:27:18] <aiena> ar1a,  JS keeps changing so much it is confusing to know whether there is a need to use anything or even what to use. There usually is a want. We don't need alcohol for example but we may want it.
[10:27:35] <cannap> ar1a before you try angular or react try vuejs
[10:27:40] <aiena> if you look at node itself there are tons of packages its hell and heaven at the same time
[10:27:43] <cannap> its much simpler to understand
[10:27:47] <ar1a> i tried looking at them both but theres this compile thing like webpack and it kept erroring and it just made no sense
[10:27:55] <cannap> jquery is  manipulates the dom
[10:27:57] <ar1a> why do i have to compile some js and shit
[10:28:01] <cannap> in vue react angular you manipulate data
[10:28:09] <ar1a> the DOM?
[10:28:25] <aiena> ar1a, different use cases. DOM is the Document Object Model how HTML is structured
[10:28:26] <cannap> and vue/react/vue will change the dom how do you change the data
[10:29:09] <ar1a> im just wanting to make a simple singlepageapp
[10:29:09] <cannap> lets say hiden a div would look like  v-show="show" and the data for this in vue would be this.show = false
[10:29:14] <aiena> ar1a,  https://www.w3.org/TR/1998/WD-DOM-19980720/introduction.html
[10:29:26] <cannap> and jquery would be $('selector').hide()
[10:29:29] <ar1a> i dont think i need all that when i can just use jquerys .show and .hide and stuff
[10:30:11] <cannap> but not sure jquery is the right choice for spa
[10:30:45] <cannap> you can get much faster results with vuejs has simple routing when you need it has also state management with vuex
[10:30:59] <cannap> sry my english omg
[10:31:48] <ar1a> idk jquery seems simple and thats good
[10:32:25] <cannap> ok
[10:41:19] <sillyslux> ar1a, i've tried to create an spa with jquery and it all started easy and fast but with more functionality the code got exponentially more confusing and the progress was slower and slower
[10:41:35] <sillyslux> when i switched to react, it was the other way around
[10:41:45] <ar1a> mines a really basic spa its just a control panel
[10:41:52] <ar1a> im not sure whats involved with making an spa though
[10:41:58] <ar1a> ive never done it before and there arent many tutorials
[10:44:20] <cannap> there is a plugin for jquery to make two-way binding
[10:44:32] <cannap> http://jquerymy.com/ maybe this will help
[10:44:37] <cannap> to sure what is you goal
[10:45:40] <cannap> not*
[10:46:37] <ar1a> i made a bot for discord and i want to control it with a webpage
[10:46:49] <ar1a> so i wrote a REST api to change shit
[10:48:13] <ar1a> and now i want a nice SPA frontend
[10:54:16] <sillyslux> i think if you care about routing and browserhistory the you should definitely use react/vue, otherwise just use jquery
[10:56:54] <ar1a> what do you mean by routing
[10:58:20] <sillyslux> my users are always redirected to /index.html, from there the spa creates the page depending on the location that's displayed in the adressbar
[10:59:03] <sillyslux> navigating within the page doesn't reload the whole page, which is the point of an spa
[10:59:39] <sillyslux> but it changes the location and updates the history for the back button to work
[10:59:44] <sillyslux> correctly
[11:00:31] <ar1a> i just use hashes
[11:00:42] <sillyslux> i don't
[11:00:49] <ar1a> there's ur problem
[11:01:01] <sillyslux> a problem, it's not
[11:01:05] <cannap> and then you check if window.location.hash what ever === 'bla' ajax load bla ?
[11:01:14] <ar1a> yes
[11:01:51] <cannap> https://visionmedia.github.io/page.js/
[11:02:57] <cannap> ah there are jquery router plugins  lol
[11:04:17] <sillyslux> cannap, if i had seen this earlier i probably still wouldn't have tried react
[11:04:30] <cannap> vue?
[11:04:36] <sillyslux> on my list
[11:04:40] <cannap> do it
[11:04:42] <cannap> its very nice
[11:05:05] <sillyslux> hm? today? idk
[11:05:20] <cannap> what today
[11:05:21] <sillyslux> let me eat something first ;)
[11:05:23] <cannap> not today when you have some time
[11:05:25] <cannap> learn vue :P
[11:05:26] <ar1a> does vue have that dumb webpack thing
[11:05:28] <ar1a> or whatever the fuck its called
[11:05:34] <cannap> you can use vue without webpack
[11:05:36] <ar1a> that makes development a pain
[11:05:40] <cannap> what
[11:05:42] <sillyslux> oh webpack :D
[11:05:44] <cannap> webpack is awesome
[11:05:55] <cannap> npm install require and everything is fine
[11:06:13] <cannap> i mean npm install some.package
[11:06:25] <sillyslux> and require it
[11:06:33] <sillyslux> then everything is fine
[11:06:33] <cannap> https://github.com/vuejs-templates/simple
[11:06:58] <cannap> you can just copy paste this index https://github.com/vuejs-templates/simple/blob/master/template/index.html
[11:06:59] <cannap> and start
[11:07:51] <sillyslux> did github change it's design recently?
[11:08:04] <sillyslux> there's something dark
[11:08:26] <sillyslux> the bar on top is black
[11:09:59] <ar1a> yeah
[11:10:27] <sillyslux> yeah i don't like that
[11:10:57] <sillyslux> they can't just change this shit
[11:12:01] <cannap> https://twitter.com/mdo/status/830138373230653440
[11:12:49] <sillyslux> many design changes coming? noooo... why????
[11:14:07] <sillyslux> roll it all back and make github great again
[11:16:25] <cannap> any will bringt a extension or something
[11:16:30] <cannap> to get the old style back
[15:31:32] <TubbyTommy> Can someone tell me where to get icons-36-white.png? I'm not sure why I don't have it
[18:19:30] <bcow> I have a jquery.post() that returns a json response, when the code is running on a production server the error handler is getting called with status "error" even though the http response is 200 and the json is valid
[18:19:44] <bcow> any suggestions what would cause the error handler to get called?
[18:23:52] <xdevnull> Hello
[21:26:52] <Miyagii> Hello
[21:27:09] <Miyagii> if i wanna do something will all div's with names : btn1, btn2, btn3 is there something like btn* in bash?  (javascript/jquery)
[21:50:53] <carpii> Miyagii: why not assign them all a class to group them together?
[21:51:19] <carpii> or locate them via their parent, if they are already grouped together in the DOM
[21:51:55] <carpii> $("#buttoncontainer div.btn").etc()
[21:56:53] <Miyagii> ('[id^="btn"]')
[21:57:01] <Miyagii> already done somethin like this and its working
[21:57:04] <Miyagii> but thank you
[21:57:29] <carpii> np
[21:57:46] <carpii> didnt think of that tbh :p
[21:58:38] <Miyagii> But i have another question, how i can center icons? text-align center is not working
[21:58:51] <carpii> center them in what container?
[21:59:44] <Miyagii> I am making slider, there is no any container actually at the moment, but forget about icons, at first i have to center images :D There is no container just five <img> tags
[21:59:54] <Miyagii> i wrote in .css img { text-align:center}
[21:59:56] <Miyagii> and nothin
[22:00:06] <carpii> youd need to provide a jsfiddle, too many variables to even guess
[22:00:22] <carpii> https://jsfiddle.net/
[22:00:33] <Miyagii> 	<body onload="changeslide(); loadbuttons()">
[22:00:33] <Miyagii> 		<div id="slider">
[22:00:33] <Miyagii> 			<img src="slides/img1.jpg" id="slide1">
[22:00:33] <Miyagii> 			<img src="slides/img2.jpg" id="slide2">
[22:00:35] <Miyagii> 			<img src="slides/img3.jpg" id="slide3">
[22:00:38] <Miyagii> 			<img src="slides/img4.jpg" id="slide4">
[22:00:38] <carpii> please dont paste
[22:00:40] <Miyagii> 			<img src="slides/img5.jpg" id="slide5">
[22:00:43] <Miyagii> 		</div>
[22:00:45] <Miyagii> 	</body>
[22:00:48] <Miyagii> </html>that's all what i got
[22:00:50] <Miyagii> in html
[22:00:54] <Miyagii> and somehow it cant center itself :/ sorry
[22:01:03] <carpii> so the container is #slider
[22:01:10] <Miyagii> oh, right... omg
[22:01:48] <Miyagii> did #slider { text-align: center} and nothing
[22:02:01] <Miyagii> maybe it has something to do with javascript/jquery that i made?
[22:02:03] <Miyagii> is it possible?
[22:02:32] <carpii> youd need to provide a jsfiddle, too many variables to even guess
[22:02:36] <carpii> https://jsfiddle.net/
[22:02:43] <Miyagii> Alright one sec
[22:05:24] <Miyagii> carpii: check pm please
[22:08:19] <carpii> sorry man, if you cant create a jsfiddle or some sort of example i can tinker with, i cant help
[22:08:30] <carpii> the html source youve pasted links to external css and all sorts of stuff
[22:09:42] <carpii> if text-align:center isnt working on #slider container, it might be because youve set a display: on the img's
[22:09:58] <carpii> and if you have, try margin:auto
[22:10:02] <carpii> on the imgs
[22:11:50] <Miyagii> yeah it is working!!
[22:11:52] <Miyagii> nice
[22:11:56] <carpii> :)
[22:11:56] <Miyagii> thank you :)
[22:11:58] <carpii> np
[22:12:04] <carpii> what was it?
[22:12:59] <Miyagii> there is another problem :D how to center that icons, in this time margin auto doesnt work
[22:13:33] <Miyagii> i could just use margin-left etc but it seems to be bad solution
[22:15:14] <carpii> well technically it ought to be margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto
[22:15:24] <carpii> but really you are asking questions which i cant answer without seeing your live code
[22:15:30] <carpii> so again, a jsfiddle..... ;)
[22:16:43] <carpii> or http://codepen.io/pen/
[22:44:25] <Miyagii> carpii: are you still there? :)
[22:44:33] <carpii> yup
[22:45:32] <Miyagii> carpii: im making now left button to my slider, i want it to go back to previous image on slide, i thought that the best thing will be to change te main variable 'numer' to the previous number
[22:45:44] <Miyagii> numer = (numer-1); will it work?
[22:47:30] <carpii> have you tried it?
[22:48:37] <carpii> im not a magician, and Im kinda bored of asking to see your code :/
[22:48:53] <Miyagii> function arrowleft()
[22:48:53] <Miyagii> {
[22:48:53] <Miyagii> 	clearTimeout(timer1);
[22:48:53] <Miyagii> 		    numer -1;
[22:48:53] <Miyagii> 	    changeslide();
[22:48:55] <carpii> no
[22:48:57] <Miyagii> thats what i've got
[22:48:59] <carpii> quit pasting
[22:49:07] <Miyagii> sorry
[22:49:12] <Miyagii> it is so small :P
[22:49:21] <carpii> yes but it doesnt help
[22:49:27] <Miyagii> alright, one sec
[22:49:34] <carpii> because ive no idea where numer is defined or anything
[22:49:53] <Miyagii> carpii: http://pastebin.com/anFXmY9N
[22:50:00] <Miyagii> whole three scripts
[22:50:22] <Miyagii> i think that it just do -1 only for that function
[22:50:41] <Miyagii> and when i do changeslide(); it starts where it stopped
[22:50:58] <carpii> the code you pasted saya
[22:51:00] <carpii>  numer -1;
[22:52:03] <carpii> either do numer--; or numer = numer - 1;
[22:52:09] <carpii> numer -1; means nothing :)
[22:52:45] <Miyagii> did numer = numer - 1; and something is happening, but it is something strange.. :D
[22:52:58] <carpii> why does that not surprise me ;)
[22:53:13] <Miyagii> hahahah, i will try -2!
[22:53:52] <Miyagii> it is workin! -2 is workin
[22:53:53] <Miyagii> haaa!
[22:55:32] <carpii> why would -2 work?
[22:56:45] <Miyagii> i have no idea, but it is working
[22:57:55] <carpii> "while (numer <= imagesnumber) { numer++; }"  <=== why not just say "numer = imagesnumber"?
[23:00:38] <Miyagii> right...
[23:00:43] <Miyagii> i found a problem
[23:00:48] <Miyagii> -2 working but
[23:00:53] <Miyagii> when i'm on first slide
[23:00:55] <Miyagii> it is not
[23:00:58] <Miyagii> did something like this :
[23:01:19] <Miyagii> http://pastebin.com/MJ84fQTQ
[23:01:46] <Miyagii> why it is crashing slider? :/
[23:02:08] <Miyagii> the purpose whas that script checkecked
[23:02:13] <Miyagii> if 1 slide was on
[23:02:26] <Miyagii> and if it was it would jump to last number
[23:02:36] <carpii> dont know create a jsfiddle.
[23:07:42] <Miyagii> carpii: 			numer = imagesnumber - 1;
[23:07:44] <Miyagii> is this
[23:07:48] <Miyagii> okay?
[23:08:25] <carpii> no idea
[23:08:40] <carpii> im done trying to help you now, sorry
[23:09:53] <Miyagii> carpii: okay, thanks :)
