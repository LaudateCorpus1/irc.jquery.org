[00:10:52] <dougx1> Mark____: this does it https://jsfiddle.net/Lk43ugx4/1/
[00:11:15] <Mark____> thanks!
[00:11:16] <Mark____> um.
[00:11:32] <dougx1> the fiddle "reaches into" some other fiddle page
[00:11:37] <dougx1> basically recreates your scenario
[00:11:38] <Mark____> right.
[00:11:45] <Mark____> never seen this kind of js
[00:11:59] <Mark____> but do i have to specify src all the time?
[00:12:03] <Mark____> that might not work for my case.
[00:12:10] <Mark____> cause i get url from the item that i click on.
[00:12:17] <dougx1> you want it to mind-read what address to populate the iframe with?
[00:12:21] <dougx1> :D
[00:12:25] <Mark____> well
[00:12:26] <Mark____> sort of.
[00:12:32] <Mark____> but anyways, i’ll tell you how it goes after i try it.
[00:12:46] <Mark____> not very good at jquery and jacascripts.
[00:12:50] <Mark____> javascript*
[00:13:21] <Mark____> wait.
[00:13:29] <Mark____> there’s nothing in the html section.
[00:13:46] <Mark____> so this javascript just appends iframe to the random place of the body?
[00:23:06] <Mark____> so far not working.
[00:23:24] <dougx1> Mark____: yes my test case just appends it to the body
[00:23:37] <dougx1> in a real program it would append it to somewhere appropriate
[00:23:56] <Mark____> okay. um
[00:24:08] <Mark____> so is it okay to put it like this : appendTo(‘#wall');
[00:24:18] <dougx1> all it does it 1) create the iframe element, 2) attach a 'load' event handler, and 3) append it somewhere to make it start loading and stuff
[00:24:26] <dougx1> is*
[00:24:32] <Mark____> okay.
[00:24:35] <Mark____> so far it’s not working.
[00:24:40] <Mark____> hmm
[00:24:46] <Mark____> i must have done something wrong.
[00:25:10] <dougx1> Mark____: any console errors?
[00:25:18] <Mark____> no. im not getting any error from that js.
[00:25:21] <Mark____> few from others but.
[00:25:31] <dougx1> you cant ignore errors!
[00:25:46] <dougx1> it abandons the rest of the code when an uncaught error occurs
[00:26:05] <Mark____> right, but im telling you this one’s fine, it has been around for many many days,
[00:26:16] <dougx1> in other words, if there are errors, then unknown amounts of stuff will be skipped
[00:26:18] <Mark____> plus i cannot solve this console error.
[00:26:21] <Mark____> i already know that.
[00:26:23] <Mark____> hmm
[00:26:23] <Mark____> sec.
[00:27:29] <dougx1> if you put a console.log RIGHT before the iframe code, does it print the message?
[00:27:41] <Mark____> yes. i fixed the console error, stil not response.
[00:27:42] <dougx1> console.log('about to try iframe')
[00:27:45] <Mark____> *no
[00:27:55] <dougx1> see if that message even comes up
[00:27:58] <Mark____> sec
[00:28:02] <dougx1> if it doesnt then it isnt even making it to that code
[00:28:09] <Mark____> how do  im put the console log
[00:28:10] <Mark____> ?
[00:28:33] <Mark____> *how do i do that?
[00:28:34] <dougx1> I showed example that prints "about to try iframe" above
[00:28:48] <dougx1> put it on line before that $('<iframe... stuff
[00:29:28] <Mark____> so just copy paste console.log('about to try iframe')?
[00:29:35] <dougx1> yes
[00:29:44] <Mark____> undefined of course.
[00:30:09] <dougx1> ...
[00:30:12] <dougx1> I mean into the code
[00:30:23] <dougx1> before it creates the iframe?
[00:30:37] <Mark____> im sorry, im not fast enough to think over all the stuff that you already understand.
[00:30:38] <Mark____> sec
[00:30:57] <Mark____> to be honest, i don’t even know how :p
[00:31:08] <Mark____> i just typed in console.log('about to try iframe') like you told me to,
[00:31:23] <Mark____> how do i specifically put that thing into the ‘code’?
[00:31:50] <dougx1> I thought you were the programmer writing a program and it had to auto-size an iframe in your jquery
[00:32:13] <Mark____> it is. except that most of the part i write is only html and css.
[00:32:20] <Mark____> sorry, im stil learning jquery.
[00:32:29] <Mark____> and im using the CMS already available.
[00:33:26] <dougx1> the answer is, you read the contentDocument property of the iframe element (in jquery, you might use .prop('contentDocument')
[00:33:55] <dougx1> then there are lots of ways to get the information about the size
[00:34:04] <Mark____> okay?
[00:34:07] <dougx1> more or less pure jquery  / pure js ways
[00:34:14] <Mark____> what are you suggesting?
[00:34:17] <Mark____> :p
[00:34:57] <dougx1> jquery takes a 2nd parameter that specifies the document
[00:35:16] <dougx1> pass the contentDocument property of the iframe there to synthesize elements for it or do queries
[00:35:41] <Mark____> not that it makes any sense to me, but this is the site im having problem with.
[00:35:41] <Mark____> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[00:35:51] <dougx1> you could get the height() and width() of body
[00:35:54] <Mark____> and i inserted the source you gave me, and it’s simply not showing.
[00:35:55] <Mark____> okay.
[00:36:05] <Mark____> i understand how the source works/
[00:36:13] <dougx1> ya and you told me there are errors and it doesnt even make it to the code
[00:36:22] <dougx1> I asked you to verify and you dont know how to add a line
[00:36:28] <Mark____> right.
[00:36:46] <Mark____> i know this is frustrating for you.
[00:37:34] <Mark____> took a break of a month or so, so probably my bare knowledge of jquery has gone missing.
[00:37:35] <Mark____> :p
[00:37:37] <dougx1> I know the code works, the fiddle works
[00:37:47] <dougx1> it does very little
[00:37:58] <Mark____> yeah except it’s not working.
[00:37:58] <dougx1> nothing cool, just makes an element, lets it load, does a thing
[00:39:06] <Mark____> anyways, thanks.
[00:39:31] <Mark____> i gotta go figure out why it doesn’t work first.

[04:02:20] <yabbah> Hi, I do a 'echo json_encode($rows);' from php, but how do I grab it in the html-file/jquery?
[04:15:28] <yabbah> Found out, json.parse. But now, how do I present the result in the select-element?
[04:23:27] <Duikb00t> omgfcollapsible set item ?
[04:23:52] <Duikb00t> yabbah:  you want to load your items into a <select> ?
[04:24:17] <xec> yabbah: if your server is sending the correct headers you shouldn't have to json.parse it
[04:24:59] <xec> yabbah: you can also tell jquery to expect json by setting contentType to "json"
[04:25:09] <xec> sorry, dataType
[04:26:42] <xec> yabbah: what does your json look like (pastebin it?)
[04:30:26] <DevAntoine> hi
[04:30:39] <DevAntoine> I'm modifying the dom with .html() and right after (the next instruction call) I'm trying to query a newly inserted element without success, I'm kinda stuck
[04:33:14] <DevAntoine`> I'm modifying the dom with .html() and right after (the next instruction call) I'm trying to query a newly inserted element without success, I'm kinda stuck
[04:35:15] <ferr> How would I use variables so I can store the geo location info and use it later? https://gist.github.com/Fercell/51173aad1cae14f26998
[04:36:03] <DevAntoine`> seems weird that I can't select an element after changing the dom oO
[04:50:21] <Teddy_> hey guys, sorry if not the right topic, anyone know why this module won't add the function to the dom element? is the logic wrong? http://pastie.org/10743103#
[04:58:09] <DevAntoine`> Teddy_, the element is in the dom when init is executed?
[04:58:55] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, not 100%, i'll add document.onload
[05:03:48] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, revised version, still no bite http://pastie.org/10743130
[05:04:11] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, added a window.onload function to call the initialization
[05:04:16] <DevAntoine`> make a working example please Teddy_
[05:09:25] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, i made a working example here, https://jsbin.com/qoguhihoca/edit?html,js,console,output
[05:10:21] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, my intention is to change the event from click to drop and prevent the page from going to the image url using the call function and preventdefault
[05:11:02] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, in the example it works as click but when made as a drop event, page always goes to the image url
[05:11:58] <DevAntoine`> Teddy_, I can't produce a drop there considering there's nothing to drop
[05:12:13] <DevAntoine`> I had hard time using the native drag&drop api
[05:12:23] <DevAntoine`> but I don't understand your test case
[05:12:56] <DevAntoine`> when someone drops an link on this div you won't to disable the link's click?
[05:13:01] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, idea it would be a module that will upload a file that is gragged and dropped
[05:13:16] <DevAntoine`> *want nor won't
[05:13:27] <DevAntoine`> s/nor/not
[05:13:27] <b-ot> Correction, <DevAntoine`> *want not won't
[05:13:30] * DevAntoine` is tired
[05:14:19] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, the code works, however if you try to add a drop event rather then click or hover, and tried to drop a image in square, the page will forward to the iamge url
[05:16:52] <DevAntoine`> Teddy_, then plz make this live example with the image and the drag event
[05:17:25] <DevAntoine`> have you try intercepting the click event? Is it fired when dragging the image?
[05:25:46] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, click event is fired , this example has two events, dragenter and drop, dragenter seems to work, but on drop the page goes to the iamge url
[05:25:46] <Teddy_> https://jsbin.com/meyodulohi/1/edit?html,js,console,output
[05:26:10] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, despite dreventDefault() that should stop that
[05:26:18] <DevAntoine`> Teddy_, there's no image :D
[05:26:38] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, the iamge is off the system
[05:26:50] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, i tried with any file in my pc
[05:26:59] <DevAntoine`> oh, so I just drop one of my file
[05:26:59] <DevAntoine`> ok
[05:27:29] <DevAntoine`> wow
[05:27:32] <DevAntoine`> that's a funny behavior
[05:27:54] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, i know, it's rly hard to tell why it would go to the image url
[05:28:11] <DevAntoine`> it's not even a url oO
[05:28:30] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, it just goes to the file path, rly annoying
[05:36:52] <DevAntoine`> Teddy_, I really have no cllue about it :/
[05:37:01] <DevAntoine`> but I'm really interested by the solution
[05:41:52] <Teddy_> DevAntoine`, same here :/ added it to stackoverflow, maybe some ninja knows more on this
[06:00:27] <_eddy> hi, http://kopy.io/fqk7S I want to use the customErrorMessage function(line 21) in line 4 the issue i am facing is that the "swal" function script is in line 17 and i am getting "undefined swal". Is they a way of using it in line 4? Thanks
[06:15:40] <shoky_> Teddy_: you want 'dragover' event, not 'dragenter'
[06:19:13] <Teddy_> shoky_, thanks, will eddit that, it's the drop that is causing the problem, the function should prevent default but it just forward the browser to the file path
[06:20:38] <shoky_> Teddy_ or maybe it's best to cancel both dragover and dragenter actually
[06:20:57] <shoky_> Teddy_:  that happens because you didn't cancel the dragover event.
[06:21:17] <Teddy_> shoky_, cancel how? return null or return false ?
[06:22:03] <shoky_> Teddy_ : the same way you're cancelling
[06:22:25] <shoky_> that is, evt.preventDefault()
[06:23:12] <Teddy_> shoky_, so calceling both 'dragenter' and 'dragenter' shoudl fix it ? sweet, let me try
[06:23:25] <shoky_> dragenter and dragover, ya
[06:25:22] <Teddy_> shoky_, damn that was it, didnt' know you need to cancel both event if you want to cancel the drop as well
[06:25:42] <Teddy_> shoky_, that is one weird condition
[06:25:57] <shoky_> Teddy_:  cancelling dragover is what makes the element a drop target, to begin with
[06:26:04] <DevAntoine`> I can do .show() chained to a .clone() right?
[06:26:11] <shoky_> Teddy_: if you don't cancel dragover,  then "drag" won't be fired at all
[06:26:24] <shoky_> Teddy_: er i mean" drop"
[06:26:50] <shoky_> DevAntoine`: you can but it won't do anything if you didnt append the clone to the DOM
[06:26:55] <Teddy_> shoky_, makes sense, didn't know that, thanks
[06:27:30] <DevAntoine`> oh
[06:27:43] <DevAntoine`> and I can't chain .show() to .append() right?
[06:28:19] <shoky_> .append returns what you called it on, not what you're appending
[06:28:38] <shoky_> you can use .appendTo tho, and chain to that, if you're that obsessive about chaining :P
[06:30:40] <DevAntoine`> thanks shoky_!

[07:20:47] <zoob> hello
[07:21:44] <shoky_> hy
[07:22:37] <zoob> i have a question for jszip
[07:23:01] <zoob> it's a javascript question
[07:23:11] <zoob> hoping someone could help
[07:23:14] <zoob> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35721411/
[07:24:34] <shoky_> whats this supposed to do...... if (str1 == "") {null;}
[07:25:11] <shoky_> zoob also the comment tells you: you didnt put any arguments in the `getin` function
[07:25:18] <shoky_> it won't receive the `i` you pass it
[07:25:34] <shoky_> you need   function getin(i) { .. }
[07:25:43] <zoob> i'm lost i dont know what to add
[07:26:02] <shoky_> i just told you
[07:26:03] <shoky_> :)
[07:26:29] <shoky_> but also..     null;   doesn't do anything
[07:26:58] <zoob> if i write function getin(i) {
[07:27:06] <zoob> it is undefined
[07:27:21] <shoky_> what is undefined
[07:27:36] <zoob> the i
[07:28:34] <shoky_> oh you're callnig the function from the onclick :\
[07:28:43] <zoob> if (str1 == "") {null;}  <--- i want the new replacement to not be empty
[07:29:00] <shoky_> what do you awnt to happen if str1 is empty?
[07:29:07] <zoob> do you have jszip ?
[07:29:10] <shoky_> maybe you want return;  instead of null;
[07:29:12] <zoob> can you test it
[07:29:20] <shoky_> i dont want to test it.
[07:29:29] <shoky_> you can make a jsfiddle if you want me to test it,
[07:29:30] <shoky_> uh
[07:29:41] <shoky_> you want it to loop the 100 times, when you click?
[07:30:46] <shoky_> it's not clear what you want to happen..
[07:31:28] <zoob> i want it to download a zip file with 100 files -  contains "a1", export2.txt contains "a2"
[07:31:48] <zoob> export1.txt = a1
[07:31:50] <shoky_> you want the loop to happen on click?
[07:31:52] <shoky_> or on page load?
[07:32:34] <zoob> onclick to make the zip contain 100 files with different numbers not only on the file but in the content
[07:33:16] <zoob> currently it gives me the last number only with content
[07:33:25] <zoob> all the others are just numbers
[07:33:55] <zoob> ok here's a different question
[07:34:29] <zoob> instead of clicking to make the output display var end = str1.replace (reg, e+i)
[07:34:49] <zoob> i want it to change dynamically on input of new word
[07:35:11] <zoob> i think that's the solution
[07:35:24] <zoob> but i dont know how it's done
[07:35:45] <zoob> i need it to read it automatically as i type, and change it in tur
[07:35:46] <zoob> n
[07:35:58] <shoky_> zoob: sec
[07:46:24] <shoky_> zoob:  this is a start.. https://jsfiddle.net/antishok/671homoc/
[07:47:08] <shoky_> don't really know what you want to happen with the regex replace, and the output field
[07:47:15] <shoky_> but now it creates 100 zip files
[07:47:21] <shoky_> er, zip with 100 files ;p
[07:51:36] <django_> i wanna have two input fields and require user to type in both before they can submit
[07:58:35] <bojanlazic> how would you refactor this so it added's classes and wraps every 2 divs by it self with for loop http://codepen.io/Kibs/pen/aNzvBG?editors=1011
[08:02:17] <django_> how can i require a user to type in the inputs
[08:02:21] <django_> i found this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19166685/jquery-add-required-to-input-fields
[08:02:27] <django_> but i have two inputs that i want to require the user
[08:02:32] <django_> they are both text fields
[08:03:11] <shoky_> <input ... required>
[08:04:19] <django_> shoky_, i hit enter and it goes
[08:04:31] <django_> n/m
[08:16:54] <Duikb00t> Someone using : .sticky( plugin?
[08:17:12] <Duikb00t> I am currently doing: $("header nav").sticky({  which works perfect, but is there a way to make it fadein?

[08:25:23] <vNull> hello ppl
[08:26:12] <vNull> I've js file (class) i want getThat file via $.getScript() and then create new object
[08:30:26] <zoob> shoky thanks
[08:30:40] <zoob> it's still not done but that's another way to do a for
[08:31:41] <DevAntoine> if I bind an element to listen to multiple events (elt.on('click hover foo', function() {})) can I know which event triggered the listener?
[08:37:23] <decx> e.type
[08:38:13] <r3ply> DevAntoine: you need to check if the event is passed to the function, should be
[08:39:19] <DevAntoine> decx, yep, just saw that after browsing the doc
[08:43:08] <bojanlazic> shoky_: got few mins? :)
[08:50:13] <shoky_> bojanlazic yer
[09:01:12] <bojanlazic> shoky_: how would you refactor this so it add's classes and wraps every 2 divs by it self with for loop http://codepen.io/Kibs/pen/aNzvBG?editors=1011
[09:03:08] <DevAntoine> I feel like this code is ugly but I don't see any improvment to it: http://pastebin.com/evu9eWzz What do you thnk?
[09:03:56] <DevAntoine> it feels redundant for the 'variantLoaded' case
[09:05:55] <shoky_> bojanlazic: you can do it with that for loop.. just need to put numbers in the .slice(...)
[09:06:02] <shoky_> bojanlazic:  e.g.  .slice(i,i+2)
[09:10:01] <bojanlazic> shoky_: hmm when I inspect it's not working http://codepen.io/Kibs/pen/aNzvBG?editors=1011
[09:10:14] <decx> x.length in the loop
[09:10:37] <shoky_> ^
[09:11:13] <shoky_> bojanlazic:  i < x   is wrong
[09:11:38] <bojanlazic> I thought it's my approach but can't figure it out :/
[09:11:47] <shoky_> x is not a number
[09:12:00] <bojanlazic> ahhh should i use x.length?
[09:12:22] <shoky_> yes as decx just said ;p
[09:12:25] <bojanlazic> yea its woring
[09:12:31] <bojanlazic> thanks so muchhhh!  <3
[09:12:40] <decx> whoring at this time?
[09:12:43] <bojanlazic> didn't even see what he said :D thanks decx too
[09:12:56] <shoky_> hhh
[09:27:29] <DevAntoine> if I do: elt.html(html); $(window).trigger('event'); is it possible that the event is being fired before elt's html is replaced?
[09:28:32] <decx> no
[09:29:23] <DevAntoine> decx: even with big chunks of html?
[09:29:45] <decx> it's not async
[09:29:51] <decx> it'll do one thng then the next
[09:30:10] <DevAntoine> I'm getting crazy, I want to manipulate a dom element once the html has been replaced but it seems that my element is being erased by .html() which is supposed to be executed before
[09:30:34] <DevAntoine> decx: yes, I know it's async but I really have no clue about what's happenning :/
[09:46:12] <DevAntoine> hum
[09:46:41] <DevAntoine> if I've put a break point right after a console.log showing me the elemt's html where I'm inserted some node
[09:47:05] <DevAntoine> the console.log shows me the inserted node
[09:47:25] <DevAntoine> but if in the console I type myElt.html() I don't see the inserted node
[09:47:28] <DevAntoine> wtf?????
[09:47:39] <DevAntoine> because the js is paused due to the breakpoint?
[10:23:40] <vNull> hey
[10:23:54] <vNull> I've problem with hasClass() return true always -.-
[10:24:39] <vNull> i've two classess like this (name: foo) and another one is (name: foo_active). if i do foo hasClass ('foo_active') returns always true
[10:25:28] <taplar> got an example?
[10:26:29] <vNull> oh
[10:26:48] <vNull> [class*="foo_active"]
[10:26:58] <vNull> was better than hasClass("foo_active")
[10:27:34] <DevAntoine> I've got a simple jquery object: $('.foo') assign to the $foo var. If I delete the node containing this object and then recreate it I've got to reassign $foo to $('.foo') right?
[10:27:53] <taplar> yep
[10:32:15] <vNull> is it possible to handle mutli-click stuff
[10:32:23] <vNull> like i've button to fadeIn an div.
[10:32:33] <vNull> each time u click it the div will be visible.
[10:32:50] <taplar> sure
[10:32:55] <vNull> nwo if he click the button 1000times so the fadeIn will accure 1000times
[10:33:38] <vNull> How i can prevent that. Like if he clicked the button it will be visible after he need to wait 10 seconds let's say
[10:34:05] <taplar> your wanting to throttle the event.
[10:34:25] <decx> stop using js animations
[10:34:30] <decx> there, solved
[10:34:42] <taplar> you could either disable the button for 10 seconds or use one() to bind and rebind after 10 seconds
[10:35:00] <taplar> or just not fadein if it's already visible
[10:35:55] <vNull> taplar is there any function for
[10:35:58] <vNull> isVisible() ?
[10:36:05] <taplar> is(':visible')
[10:36:34] <taplar> if (!$(selector).is(':visible')) { /* do stuff */ }
[10:37:13] <vNull> You're the boss
[10:37:24] <vNull> <3 If i'm a girl. i would fall in love with you
[10:37:25] <vNull> :D
[10:37:30] <vNull> or gay
[10:37:45] <taplar> please, continue further, ;)
[10:38:50] <januarius> why $._data($('selector')[0], 'events').click.length==1 while in Chrome developer tools i see a lots of listeners for this event ?
[10:39:28] <shoky_> januarius: they might be non-jquery event handlers
[10:41:42] <januarius> so silly of me ! thanks!
[10:49:40] <vNull> taplar
[10:49:51] <vNull> can i use that syntax aswell for addClass()
[10:49:58] <vNull> like addClass(['class ,, ?
[10:50:14] <taplar> your selector thing you did earlier?
[10:50:29] <vNull> Yes..
[10:50:35] <taplar> no, you have to give it the class(es)
[10:50:46] <vNull> dammit it's not working now
[10:50:51] <vNull> i'll show u snippet
[10:50:51] <taplar> fiddle?
[10:52:42] <vNull> http://laravel.io/bin/REMG8
[10:53:22] <vNull> oh
[10:53:23] <vNull> shit
[10:53:52] <vNull> logic error
[10:53:53] <vNull> sry
[10:54:13] <taplar> the hasClass() issue?
[10:55:04] <vNull> addClass
[10:55:06] <vNull> it's not adding :/
[10:55:14] <taplar> hasClass() returns a boolean
[10:56:02] <vNull> yes i've changed
[10:56:13] <vNull> http://laravel.io/bin/Yymb8
[10:57:24] <taplar> is there only one vv_up and vv_down on the page?
[10:57:41] <taplar> vv_uu and vv_dd
[10:57:51] <vNull> yes
[10:58:32] <vNull> lol
[10:58:34] <vNull> found it
[10:58:36] <vNull> I'm stupid.

[10:58:58] <vNull> :P
[10:59:25] <vNull> My life getting harder
[11:00:00] <vNull> How to handle hover out in that case :/
[11:06:41] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/9pe825jh/
[11:09:49] <vNull> Worest life ever with 3g -.-
[11:13:34] <vNull> huh dafuq still opening the url
[11:13:38] <vNull> !ping

[11:14:59] <vNull> ty boss
[11:18:18] <sadtaco> oh and nvm
[11:19:23] <sadtaco> Too much recursion on push.apply( results, context.getElementsByClassName( m ) );  in Sizzle()...
[11:19:32] <sadtaco> So something wrong with some selector I guess, but it's only in Firefox... it's fine in chrome
[11:37:11] <jomofcw> Hello !
[11:37:40] <taplar> domo
[11:37:47] <jomofcw> Is it correct to add a click listener to the body, to be able to close a modal when a click is perform out of this modal, please ?
[11:38:05] <taplar> sure
[11:38:38] <taplar> since your looking for a click any where else other than the modal
[11:38:46] <taplar> you'd just have to check that it didn't originate from the modal
[11:39:33] <jomofcw> so something like that "$(document).click(function(e){if($(this).closest('.modal').length==0)/* close modal */});" ?
[11:39:47] <jomofcw> hello taplar :).
[11:39:58] <taplar> e.target would be the origin element
[11:40:13] <jomofcw> And then I can do $(e.target) right ?
[11:40:16] <taplar> you'd have to check it is the modal or belongs to the modal
[11:41:04] <jomofcw> Would give me "$(document).click(function(e){if($(e.target).closest('.modal').length==0)/* close modal */});", right ?
[11:41:28] <taplar> looks good, but e.target could be the modal itself
[11:41:33] <taplar> so you'd need to check that too
[11:41:56] <jomofcw> taplar if I read the doc right, closest test the element itself too.
[11:42:01] <jomofcw> https://api.jquery.com/closest/
[11:42:25] <taplar> huh
[11:42:26] <decx> you read right
[11:42:29] <taplar> well there ya go
[11:42:47] <jomofcw> Thanks budies ^^ !
[11:43:06] <taplar> that's handy. didn't know it did that
[11:43:12] <jomofcw> *buddies
[11:43:28] <jomofcw> taplar nice to trade exp :P
[11:43:31] <taplar> yep
[13:05:42] <sigdk> hello. I'm using steps plugin to a form. Any idea how to move Check Address button lower here: http://s24.postimg.org/j0rbpwqdh/GInfo.png ?
[13:06:32] <taplar> seems like more of a ##css question
[13:13:40] <sigdk> taplar, yeah... but I guess I shouldn't touch css files. It might be a plugin parameter that I don't see
[13:13:58] <taplar> i'm not suggesting you touch their css files
[13:14:02] <taplar> i'm saying touch your own
[13:14:33] <taplar> *british accent* touch it
[13:57:03] <sigdk> so, I want to refactor this code: https://jsfiddle.net/u03nhx81/43/  I am populating a dropdown menu with existing users in the system. The "problem" is that the ajax query is executed at the beginning of the page load no matter if the user will eventually click on the button or not. Any idea how to deal with that ? Shall I put an onclick listener ?
[13:57:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:57:44] <robertmaxrees> what are you refactoring?
[13:57:54] <sigdk> well, not refactoring. Optimizing
[13:58:04] <robertmaxrees> so what part are you optimizing?
[13:58:05] <sigdk> The query shouldn't be executed on every page load
[13:58:35] <sigdk> the ajax one, currently on comments because I need to mock it on jsfiddle and currently I don't know how
[13:58:52] <sigdk> normally it's a query to my backend db
[13:59:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm still way lost lol - what does a click event have to do with this?
[13:59:17] <robertmaxrees> are you bringing in elements that you want to bind an event listener to?
[13:59:24] <robertmaxrees> *binding
[13:59:30] <robertmaxrees> err, you know what i mean.
[13:59:55] <chinoto> I'm getting warnings in the console about checked and value not setting properties, can I use the shortcut form to set the properties instead or do I have to use .prop()? $('<input/>',{type:'checkbox',checked:true}) and $('<select/>',{value:'lorem'})
[13:59:57] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, yes
[14:00:03] <robertmaxrees> sigdk use a delegated listener.
[14:00:38] <robertmaxrees> chinoto you should really opt to do that via the markup you're passing to $() instead of via an object.
[14:00:46] <robertmaxrees> or you want to use .prop() and .val()
[14:02:02] <chinoto> If I do value via the markup, it's more prone to attacks. What's wrong with the object?
[14:02:26] <chinoto> I could escape it of course, but that's just messy.
[14:03:24] <robertmaxrees> are you passing user input to these?
[14:03:34] <robertmaxrees> because if you are, you need to escape it.
[14:03:37] <robertmaxrees> that's not messy at all.
[14:06:36] <chinoto> I don't need to escape it if I'm setting a property (it's effectively auto escaped that way). If I stick it in markup, I have to create an element, set the textContent, and get the innerHTML, I find that quite messy. Even if there is a function for it, it's much cleaner to simply set a property.
[14:06:57] <robertmaxrees> oh okay.
[14:07:01] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you got it all figured out then.
[14:07:03] <robertmaxrees> good luck! :)
[14:07:55] <chinoto> Well not quite, is there a way to specify through the object that I want to set the properties rather than attributes?
[14:08:05] <robertmaxrees> that's what you're doing when you do it that way.
[14:08:40] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery-html-attributes
[14:09:09] <chinoto> When you use certain properties of the object, it will do special things, like text and val.
[14:10:29] <KaffeeJunky123> is there a good way to validate file inputs in jQuery?
[14:10:46] <KaffeeJunky123> or will I have to use a plugin
[14:10:57] <robertBusy> KaffeeJunky123 what all are you trying to validate?
[14:11:06] <shoky_> chinoto: why not use .prop
[14:11:25] <robertBusy> simple validation is pretty easy, but you'd be better served looking into something like jquery validatel
[14:11:30] <robertBusy> *validate
[14:11:35] <KaffeeJunky123> robertBusy: I want to validate if a file is a legal csv file
[14:11:56] <robertBusy> KaffeeJunky123 oh.  that's going to need something more heavy-handed.
[14:12:08] <chinoto> shoky_: I'd like it better this way :P
[14:12:59] <KaffeeJunky123> I will also validate server sides, but I'm uncomfortable sending them unchecked anyways
[14:13:31] <robertBusy> KaffeeJunky123 fwiw i can bypass your client-side validation pretty easily, which means your server-side is the one you want to start with.
[14:13:49] <KaffeeJunky123> robertBusy: yeah you can
[14:14:09] <KaffeeJunky123> but John Doe can't and ofc server side validation is mandatory
[14:14:19] <robertBusy> so you SHOULD start with your server-side and make that as secure as possible.  the client-side part is a convenience to the end user.
[14:14:21] <KaffeeJunky123> and that's an already solved problem :)
[14:14:39] <shoky_> chinoto: well that way doesn't exist ;p
[14:15:03] <KaffeeJunky123> robertBusy: already done, the django framework makes validation easy
[14:15:04] <robertBusy> KaffeeJunky123 then you're looking for a plugin of some kind :)
[14:15:21] <KaffeeJunky123> well, I guess another dependencie then
[14:16:07] <KaffeeJunky123> is the jqueryvalidation plugin from jqueryvalidation.org any good?
[14:16:09] <chinoto> BOOYA!
[14:16:15] <chinoto> $('<input/>',{type:'checkbox',prop:{checked:true}})
[14:16:21] <chinoto> shoky_:
[14:16:28] <robertBusy> KaffeeJunky123 what you want to do is validate a file, which is a different beast.
[14:16:29] <shoky_> that's gross ;p
[14:16:36] <robertBusy> chinoto woah duder.  that's... wow.
[14:17:15] <robertBusy> out of curiosity, why aren't you using a templating library?
[14:17:25] <chinoto> It's either that or $('<input/>',{type:'checkbox'}).prop({checked:true})
[14:17:36] <chinoto> or .prop('checked',true)
[14:17:42] <KaffeeJunky123> robertBusy, from what I read this plugin makes custom validators easier to use
[14:17:49] <KaffeeJunky123> I guess I'll just try
[14:17:56] <robertBusy> KaffeeJunky123 for normal inputs - not for opening files.
[14:18:01] <KaffeeJunky123> was just wondering if anyone is using that plugin
[14:18:11] <chinoto> robertBusy: Who is the templating thing directed at?
[14:18:16] <robertBusy> chinoto you.
[14:18:23] <shoky_> chinoto: i like $('<input type="checkbox">').prop({checked:true}).  the way you did it is gross imo, but also it's undocumented afaik
[14:18:31] <robertBusy> KaffeeJunky123 a lot of people use jquery validate, but i haven't seen anybody use it to actually open files and validate them.
[14:19:11] <chinoto> shoky_: It's documented, just not obvious: "An object of attributes, events, and methods to call on the newly-created element." https://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery-html-attributes
[14:19:29] <chinoto> shoky_: I find it more elegant my self.
[14:19:44] <robertBusy> chinoto most people are going to find that harder to read.
[14:19:51] <robertBusy> but glad you figured something out.
[14:19:57] <shoky_> chinoto: yes and it lists which methods that supports:  the following jQuery methods can be called: val, css, html, text, data, width, height, or offset.
[14:20:01] <shoky_> chinoto:  prop is not listed
[14:20:04] <chinoto> Weird, maybe they should be programming.
[14:20:13] <robertBusy> chinoto uh.
[14:20:20] <chinoto> shouldn't*
[14:20:31] <robertBusy> *sigh*
[14:20:33] <robertBusy> oh okay.
[14:20:41] <robertBusy> i'll just go give up.  shoky_ wanna join me?
[14:20:52] <shoky_> they don't understand your less readable undocumented code, of course they shouldn't be programming
[14:21:00] <shoky_> oh sorry i joined the other side first
[14:21:07] <robertBusy> shoky_ crap.
[14:21:20] <robertBusy> wait i'm a programmer. i'm always right, no matter waht.
[14:21:55] <chinoto> shoky_: That was "As of jQuery 1.4", look at "As of jQuery 1.8".
[14:22:19] <shoky_> chinoto: righto, not undocumented then
[14:22:29] <robertBusy> "While the second argument is convenient, its flexibility can lead to unintended consequences (e.g. $( "<input>", {size: "4"} ) calling the .size() method instead of setting the size attribute). The previous code block could thus be written instead as:"
[14:22:43] <robertBusy> yeesh that unreadable.
[14:22:46] <robertBusy> *that's
[14:26:23] <chinoto> Had to look up the method and attribute meanings for size. Imo, neither should be used, the method is deprecated in favor of .length and the attribute has a css alternative (width:*em;).
[14:26:52] <robertBusy> right, or you just don't use the object syntax for element creation.
[14:26:57] <chinoto> Not really the point of the argument, just pointing that out for the hell of it.
[14:26:57] <robertBusy> (shrug) but hey what do i know.
[14:27:35] * chinoto pats robertBusy 
[14:27:45] <chinoto> I'm sure you know lots of things.
[14:27:53] <robertBusy> oh cool and you're massively condescending.
[14:28:11] <chinoto> And you're assuming I'm an ass...
[14:28:21] <chinoto> I was just playing :/
[14:28:29] <robertBusy> whatevs mano.
[14:28:31] <robertBusy> enjoy.
[14:28:36] <chinoto> :(
[14:29:06] <Uhkis> if you don't wanna come out condescending, how about not saying condescending stuff :P
[14:29:39] <arc_> it's a lot more believable if you don't say it after an argument
[14:29:56] <chinoto> meh
[14:31:55] <z1haze> if I have a json response how do i actually get the data that I pass along with it?
[14:32:07] <robertBusy> z1haze you mean the json response itself?
[14:32:17] <z1haze> well i have the json response object
[14:32:28] <z1haze> i just dont know how to get the stuff that i passed back with it
[14:32:29] <chinoto> I think he's talking about the request data.
[14:32:44] <z1haze> this: https://gyazo.com/ff43bcee1c939131023f018753891a7f
[14:32:45] <robertBusy> "that i passed back with it" is ephemeral - what stuff?  the request data?
[14:32:52] <chinoto> Which seems odd.
[14:32:52] <robertBusy> that's the JSON.
[14:33:01] <robertBusy> you access the keys.
[14:33:05] <robertBusy> oh.
[14:33:27] <robertBusy> that's the actual request object.  you want .done(function(yourData) { console.log(yourData) });
[14:33:27] <z1haze> i padd it back from my server like this: response()->json(['tooltip' => 'Remove Favorite', 'action' => 'add']);
[14:33:32] <z1haze> ohh ok
[14:33:33] <z1haze> .done
[14:33:35] <robertBusy> that's not actually your response.
[14:33:45] <robertBusy> that's the jqXHR of the ajax call.
[14:33:54] <z1haze> ah
[14:33:59] <robertBusy> because it's async,
[14:34:14] <z1haze> well it must be having errors though because this log is coming from .error
[14:34:22] <z1haze> i just need to find the error and i dont know how toaccess that
[14:34:27] <robertBusy> open your network tab.
[14:34:31] <robertBusy> look for the request
[14:34:37] <robertBusy> make sure that's working correctly.
[14:34:45] <z1haze> it came back a 200
[14:34:59] <robertBusy> and the response body?
[14:35:05] <robertBusy> have you validated that to make sure it's valid?
[14:35:13] <z1haze> yea its hardcoded
[14:35:26] <z1haze> the server call is executing
[14:35:30] <robertBusy> that doesn't mean it's valid.
[14:35:32] <z1haze> because when i refresh the page the data changes
[14:35:41] <z1haze> its just not updating the dom
[14:35:48] <z1haze> ill get my ajax call and paste it
[14:36:05] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/0QWFS39
[14:36:35] <robertBusy> the return data.
[14:37:11] <Uhkis> dataType: json points to the returned json being invalid
[14:37:20] <z1haze> isnt it json though?
[14:37:22] <robertBusy> ^ is what i'm getting at.
[14:37:25] <robertBusy> i don't know, is it?
[14:37:29] <z1haze> haha yea
[14:37:33] <robertBusy> you ahven't shown us your return data.
[14:37:40] <robertBusy> it may be invalid data.
[14:37:41] <z1haze> how can i
[14:37:44] <z1haze> thats what im gettin at
[14:37:47] <robertBusy> open your network tab.
[14:37:53] <robertBusy> go to the response of that particular reques.
[14:37:56] <robertBusy> *request.
[14:37:58] <z1haze> yea im ion it
[14:38:07] <z1haze> i see rseponse headers, request headers, form data
[14:38:24] <z1haze> no body like you mentioned
[14:38:31] <robertBusy> what browser are you using?
[14:38:35] <z1haze> chrome
[14:38:44] <phelix> https://jsfiddle.net/29aLwqnq/ This works perfectly on everything except IE8, anyone have an idea how I could modify this properly so that the click event is supported with IE8?
[14:38:47] <z1haze> the response tab is empty
[14:38:50] <z1haze> preview is empty
[14:39:01] <robertBusy> what if you hit that endpoint directly in your browser?
[14:39:12] <z1haze> its a post request
[14:39:21] <Uhkis> empty response would be invalid json
[14:39:23] <robertBusy> z1haze dunno then. your server isn't responding correctly.
[14:39:28] <z1haze> weird
[14:39:34] <z1haze> i was trying something new
[14:39:43] <z1haze> i usually just json_encode([an array])
[14:39:53] <robertBusy> phelix .bind() is old, should be using .on().  and you want to call .trigger('submit'); on the form./
[14:39:54] <z1haze> and that works i wanted to try this json response its supposed to be what its for
[14:40:12] <phelix> ok let me check that thanks
[14:41:20] <robertBusy> phelix keep in mind I said "on the form" - looks like you're targeting a submit buttonb there, which is not the correct element to use for submit.
[14:41:35] <z1haze> omg haha i just realized
[14:41:46] <z1haze> i didnt return the response.. haha
[14:41:52] <robertBusy> z1haze that'd do it.
[14:42:01] <z1haze> thanks
[14:42:08] <phelix> robertBusy: Yes, although this works perfectly in everything except IE8.. Could that be the reason cause its not targeting the form?
[14:42:14] <phelix> I'll try a few things
[14:42:52] <robertBusy> phelix IE8 might think what you're doing looks a little sketchy.
[14:43:09] <islalobo> Trying to load content from ajax call into a  div: $('#medications-container').html(data);
[14:43:51] <islalobo> This doesn't load the content into the div
[14:44:12] <robertBusy> islalobo show us the code you're using for the ajax call.
[14:45:45] <islalobo> http://kopy.io/qusRr
[14:46:09] <robertBusy> okay - any console errors?  does $('#medications-container') actually exist?
[14:46:13] <robertBusy> is there only one of those on the page?
[14:46:54] <islalobo> no errors, returns an array of objects
[14:47:07] <islalobo> page template has div with specified id
[14:48:46] <islalobo> Does the data have to be a particular format?
[14:49:59] <s34n> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/zqxebZ?editors=1010
[14:50:28] <s34n> given code similar to ^^, I get a different result
[14:51:02] <islalobo> robertBusy:  Yeah, that seems to be the issue. I was working with json :|
[14:51:08] <islalobo> :)
[14:51:23] <s34n> In my code, the 's' in line 9 is different than the 's' in line 5
[14:52:11] <s34n> the line 5 's' makes it into my document. The line 9 's' is some element not included in my document
[14:53:30] <z1haze> does .parents('.row').remove() remove all the .row parents?
[14:53:40] <z1haze> how can i just remove the row that this element is in
[14:54:54] <z1haze> i think i got it with closest()
[14:55:50] <z1haze> mmm nope.. its remove the entire freakin table
[14:59:12] <islalobo> Iterating through .each() statement I'm only able to return the last value: $.each(data, function (idx, obj) {
[14:59:12] <islalobo> 	medications = obj.customMedicationName;
[14:59:12] <islalobo> 	console.log(medications);
[14:59:13] <islalobo> 	$('#medications-container').html(medications);
[14:59:14] <islalobo> });
[14:59:30] <islalobo> I didn't mean to paste that… Here: http://kopy.io/AWXmX
[14:59:46] <robertBusy> that's changing it for each thing in your data.
[14:59:58] <islalobo> Ah, true
[15:02:48] <s34n> z1haze: show some DOM so we can help
[15:03:24] <robertBusy> s34n you say you get a different result., but then don't show us what your different result is...
[15:03:56] <s34n> z1haze: $('#my.row').parent().remove()
[15:04:41] <s34n> robertBusy: yes. sorry. I can't reproduce it in a bite-size test case.
[15:04:52] <robertBusy> s34n so what's the issue you're having?
[15:08:08] <s34n> robertBusy: my instruction on line 9 is not affecting the element that actually is in my document.
[15:09:04] <robertBusy> the s.css()?
[15:09:20] <s34n> robertBusy: s.append()
[15:09:26] <s34n> s.anything
[15:09:39] <robertBusy> errr.
[15:09:44] <s34n> console.log(s) gives me an s that isn't in the document
[15:09:57] <robertBusy> are you appending it beforehand in your broken version?
[15:10:03] <robertBusy> sounds like you're losing a reference ot it.
[15:10:04] <robertBusy> *to
[15:10:24] <s34n> stepping through a debugger shows same
[15:10:41] <robertBusy> right, so you're likely doing an operation that's cloning it.
[15:10:51] <s34n> yeah
[15:12:22] <s34n> robertBusy: hang on. I'll get actual code...
[15:14:19] <s34n> robertBusy: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZWYPeK?editors=0010
[15:15:01] <robertBusy> i assume vlans is the element in question?
[15:15:19] <robertBusy> also: this.vlans() - what?
[15:15:33] <s34n> robertBusy: granted there are blackbox function calls there, but none of them should change the value of 'vlans'
[15:16:05] <s34n> robertBusy: this.vlans is a function distinct from vlans
[15:16:24] <robertBusy> that's super confusing.
[15:16:43] <robertBusy> also: is vlans global?
[15:16:55] <robertBusy> because it feels like it can magically change on your.
[15:16:56] <s34n> changing the name of 'vlans' to 'container' doesn't help
[15:16:56] <robertBusy> *you
[15:17:36] <s34n> vlans is declared at the top of the function as var vlans;
[15:18:09] <robertBusy> okay.  then i have no idea.  this particular snippet should be fine.  you're not having weird scope issues as far as i can see.
[15:22:26] <s34n> robertBusy: I took the 'debugging' noise out of that snippet, and changed the name of vlans
[15:23:34] <s34n> robertBusy: at the time of line 1, ui has not been inserted into the document, yet
[15:23:40] <s34n> does that matter?
[15:23:53] <robertBusy> share the updated code.
[15:24:11] <s34n> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZWYPeK?editors=0010
[15:24:37] <robertBusy> do you understand what $('div.panel-body', ui) is trying to dop?
[15:24:42] <robertBusy> *do
[15:25:12] <s34n> it should be finding a div.panel-body within ui
[15:25:17] <robertBusy> right.
[15:25:20] <robertBusy> and if UI doesn't exist...
[15:25:40] <s34n> ui exists, but has not been added to the document yet
[15:25:56] <s34n> by line 10, ui may have been added to the document
[15:26:11] <robertBusy> so that's a shorthand for .find() - does UI contain that other element?
[15:26:13] <s34n> but in line 1 it is a headless jquery object
[15:27:01] <s34n> line 4 appends container to the div.panel-body within ui
[15:27:10] <s34n> that code works
[15:27:20] <robertBusy> i'm wondering if $('div.panel-body', ui).append( is your issue.
[15:27:22] <robertBusy> that's all.
[15:27:48] <s34n> the container shows up in my document
[15:27:59] <s34n> along with the template content
[15:28:06] <robertBusy> at the time you make that call, does $('div.panel-body', ui) exist?
[15:28:13] <s34n> yes
[15:28:18] <robertBusy> okay.
[15:28:33] <s34n> and that call works
[15:28:55] <robertBusy> let me test something then.
[15:29:14] <s34n> and the lame debugging code where I css the background afterwords worked
[15:29:26] <robertBusy> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/0owqa4y6/ yeah so this works.
[15:29:41] <robertBusy> so i've got nothing.
[15:31:53] <s34n> me either :-(
[15:36:02] <s34n> robertBusy: fwiw, $('div.vlans', ui) also points to the same alternate universe inside the nested promises
[15:36:09] <islalobo> I'm trying to bind on click to content that is being loaded via ajax: http://kopy.io/R9a45
[15:36:18] <robertBusy> don't do that.
[15:36:22] <robertBusy> use a delegated luistener instead.
[15:37:20] <robertBusy> if you read the docs on delegated listeners, you'll see that you bind to a parent element that exists on, say, pageload.
[15:38:18] <s34n> islalobo: on which line of code are you binding?
[15:38:24] <robertBusy> 54 s34n
[15:38:30] <robertBusy> they're incorrectly using delegation.
[15:38:55] <s34n> robertBusy: I see 54. I'm wondering if islalobo is referring to that line
[15:39:20] <robertBusy> if you look at the code, you'll see that's where the problem lies :)
[15:39:25] <robertBusy> they're creating the LIs in the ajax call.
[15:39:55] <islalobo> So, it shouldn't be on click?
[15:40:06] <robertBusy> never use onclick.
[15:40:12] <robertBusy> use the delegated syntax for .on()
[15:40:17] <islalobo> on('click')
[15:40:23] <robertBusy> that's not the delegated syntax.
[15:40:34] <robertBusy> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() {});
[15:40:40] <robertBusy> the parent is a parent element that must exist on pageload.
[15:40:48] <robertBusy> the child is a selector for the element you care about.
[15:40:57] <s34n> islalobo: $('#medications-container').on('click', 'li', function(){...})
[15:41:33] <robertBusy> looking at the current one, you probably want $('#medications-container').on('click', '.medication, .add-medication, .edit-medication', function( event){
[15:43:42] <islalobo> Thank you both :) As always, robertBusy your explanations allow me to understand why something was working for me :3
[15:43:47] <islalobo> robertBusy++
[15:43:49] <robertBusy> ;)
[15:43:51] <islalobo> s34n++
[15:46:01] <s34n> robertBusy: even ui deems to lose itself inside the nested promises
[15:46:19] <robertBusy> s34n yeah, i feel like you've got some weird cloning going on somewhere.
[15:47:05] <Cyclohexane> How do I do this $('textarea').append('<b>Fatal</b> Error'); ? All that shows up is ' Error' I want 'Fatal Error', I don't care about the HTML
[15:47:48] <robertBusy> you're going to have to do something weird like  $('textarea').append($('<b>Fatal</b> Error').text());
[15:48:59] <Cyclohexane> robertBusy: funnily enough $('<b>Fatal</b> Error').text() returns 'Fatal' lol
[15:49:16] <robertBusy> ah, because you need a single root element maybe?
[15:49:21] <robertBusy> wrap a span around the whole thing?
[15:49:32] <shoky_> for textarea use .val btw..
[15:49:37] <robertBusy> ^ that too
[15:50:21] <robertBusy> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3jphwvd1/ :(
[15:50:28] <s34n> hmmm. perhaps it is the placeholder.replaceWith(ui) that I do elsewhere...
[15:51:10] <Cyclohexane> robertBusy: cheers :-)
[15:51:24] <shoky_> .html() would work there
[15:51:55] <shoky_> well assuming you want html in the textarea.
[15:52:04] <robertBusy> i think he meant that he didn't.
[15:52:13] <shoky_> ah ok
[15:53:03] <Cyclohexane> does val() append?
[15:53:07] <robertBusy> nope.
[15:53:19] <Cyclohexane> didnt think so
[15:53:20] <alaing_> hey
[15:53:26] <shoky_> .val(function(i,val) { return val + ... })   does though
[15:55:26] <robertBusy> i forget it takes a function all the time.
[16:09:45] <s34n> robertBusy: it's the replace[With|All] that does it
[16:10:59] <robertBusy> where was that?
[16:11:12] <s34n> myE.css('color','red').replaceAll('something').css('color', 'blue')  stays red
[16:11:43] <robertBusy> "The .replaceWith() method, like most jQuery methods, returns the jQuery object so that other methods can be chained onto it. However, it must be noted that the original jQuery object is returned. "
[16:11:58] <robertBusy> right, becuase you're replacing the color on original element.
[16:12:20] <s34n> myE.css('color','red').replaceAll('something'); myE.css('color', 'blue')  stays red
[16:12:42] <robertBusy> right. because myE is a different reference.
[16:12:51] <s34n> ?
[16:13:02] <robertBusy> myE was replaced in the DOM with another element.
[16:13:11] <s34n> no it wasn't
[16:13:19] <s34n> it replace another element
[16:13:26] <s34n> *replaced
[16:13:51] <robertBusy> oh, sorry i saw that as with, not all.
[16:14:01] <robertBusy> i'd bet those are being cloned in that case perhaps?
[16:14:56] <gibbers> hey, so it looks like including jquery on my page adds the following line to the head section:
[16:14:59] <gibbers> <style>iframe[src="https://ssum-sec.casalemedia.com/usermatch?s=183712&cb=https%3A%2F%2Fengine.adzerk.net%2Fudb%2F22%2Fsync%2Fi.gif%3FpartnerId%3D1%26userId%3D"]
[16:15:02] <gibbers> {display:none !important;}</style>
[16:15:10] <gibbers> what does that do?
[16:15:10] <robertBusy> gibbers jquery does not do that on its own.
[16:15:11] <s34n> http://api.jquery.com/replaceAll/ : "From this example, we can see that the selected element replaces the target by being moved from its old location, not by being cloned."
[16:15:25] <robertBusy> s34n make your own test case and see?
[16:15:35] <robertBusy> gibbers you have something else that's probably relying on jquery that's then adding that.
[16:17:14] <gibbers> oh what the hell
[16:17:22] <robertBusy> gibbers ?
[16:17:26] <gibbers> that's not good then
[16:17:40] <gibbers> yeah, sorry, I don't think it's jquery
[16:18:15] <gibbers> but I think it's only passing through twisted and jinja so one of them is doing something bad
[16:18:57] <robertBusy> you getting it from a trusted source?
[16:19:08] <Uhkis> that looks very malwareish
[16:19:09] <gibbers> pypi
[16:19:11] <gibbers> yeah exactly
[16:20:04] <gibbers> it's coming from a program that I wrote that's only listening on localhost
[16:21:12] <gibbers> ooooh geez it could be a browser extension :/
[16:21:32] <gibbers> sorry for the false accusation, I'll figure this out :/
[16:21:56] <robertBusy> nah you're good.  you got spooked.  understandable.
[16:24:48] <taplar> s34n: if your replacing multiple targets, the selected is element is cloned for all of them except the last one.  the last one being the original element
[16:26:58] <gibbers> and it just went away...
[16:27:08] <gibbers> I'm not happy
[16:33:24] <dougx1> if you append an element that is already in the document, it MOVES it to the new location. that isnt jquery's doing, that is how the browser api works
[16:34:12] <robertBusy> dougx1 right, but when you use methods like replaceWith and replaceAll against multiple elements... ;)
[16:37:40] <carefulBetty> Hi. I need help on jQuery development if possible.
[16:37:46] <robertBusy> carefulBetty sure
[16:37:52] <robertBusy> if you have a question, just ask.
[16:38:17] <carefulBetty> My question is regarding paginated items being kept on the page after page reload.
[16:38:29] <robertBusy> hrm?
[16:38:57] <carefulBetty> I already established the list of entries, as well as the pagination itself.
[16:39:14] <dougx1> it is probably easier to remove the problem by changing it so it does not reload
[16:39:14] <robertBusy> are you trying to keep things around after the page reloads?
[16:39:36] <carefulBetty> When you highlight, say, Page 2 of that area, it diverts to the second panel of entries, no problem there.
[16:39:40] <dougx1> and better for other reasons as a bonus
[16:40:14] <carefulBetty> The problem is after reloading the page, it always shifts back towards the first list
[16:40:38] <robertBusy> carefulBetty right, because you're reloading the page.
[16:40:42] <robertBusy> it "starts over".
[16:40:47] <carefulBetty> @robertBusy yes
[16:41:28] <s34n> taplar: I got that. thx. I'm replacing a single target
[16:41:31] <carefulBetty> Where do I display my code?
[16:41:37] <carefulBetty> In IRC
[16:41:42] <robertBusy> carefulBetty use jsfiddle
[16:41:51] <robertBusy> you should look into using the window hash to store some kind of state info and go from there.
[16:42:05] <s34n> robertBusy, taplar: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4375ccd7743b2c70776c
[16:42:18] <s34n> d.vlans turns red and stays red
[16:42:26] <s34n> *div.vlans
[16:42:30] <robertBusy> s34n test cases, yo :)
[16:43:02] <s34n> robertBusy: I can't reproduce it somewhere else
[16:43:07] <robertBusy> er.
[16:43:08] <robertBusy> sure you can.
[16:43:20] <robertBusy> you don't need the promises.
[16:43:32] <carefulBetty> Give me a minute. Loading on host.
[16:44:11] <s34n> robertBusy: I put the promises in to create some asynch to mimic my real case
[16:44:25] <robertBusy> s34n the promises have nothing to do with your problem.
[16:44:36] <robertBusy> you can create a test case without them.
[16:44:44] <s34n> sure
[16:45:07] <carefulBetty> tmmtekh.com/test
[16:45:07] <s34n> but I haven't come up with a testcase that exhibits my strange behavior
[16:45:22] <carefulBetty> https://jsfiddle.net/9vwzvyhz/
[16:45:35] <carefulBetty> ^The JS for pagnation
[16:45:56] <carefulBetty> https://tmmtekh.com/test
[16:46:00] <carefulBetty> ^Real-time
[16:46:12] <robertBusy> carefulBetty uh.
[16:46:20] <robertBusy> so where are you specifically having trouble?
[16:46:45] <carefulBetty> Refer to pagination on the bottom, and click any page number. Then refresh.
[16:46:57] <carefulBetty> See how it goes back to Page 1?
[16:46:58] <robertBusy> carefulBetty so what are you expecting?
[16:47:11] <robertBusy> you need to store some kind of state to refer to later...
[16:47:14] <carefulBetty> To have it stay on Page 2.
[16:47:25] <carefulBetty> Okay?
[16:47:40] <robertBusy> so you could update the window.location.hash with that.
[16:47:43] <robertBusy> and then read that on pageload.
[16:47:44] <carefulBetty> I've read about local/sessionStorage events, but I'm struggling as to how to go about with that...
[16:48:06] <robertBusy> you don't want those, and they're not events :)
[16:48:10] <robertBusy> use the window hash.
[16:49:21] <carefulBetty> Pardon me, but where exactly within the JS Fiddle do I put the window hash?
[16:49:47] <robertBusy> window.location.hash?
[16:50:11] <robertBusy> see where you're doing $('#current').val(new_page); ?
[16:50:29] <robertBusy> you could do it there.
[16:50:55] <carefulBetty> After that line?
[16:51:25] <robertBusy> so the idea is you're going to add/update that information every time you click on your pagination.
[16:51:34] <robertBusy> so it could be before or after, doesn't matter.
[16:51:37] <decx> it's a pretty involved process, read up on using hash/state management/history
[16:51:43] <robertBusy> ^
[16:52:15] <s34n> robertBusy: huh. $('<div>').length==2
[16:52:38] <robertBusy> that gives me false.
[16:53:03] <s34n> robertBusy: So replaceAll is cloning
[16:53:17] <robertBusy> s34n maybe?  did you create a test case to see if that's what's happening?
[16:53:40] <s34n> I tested ph.length, and got 2
[16:53:45] <persina> Cross post from #javascript: Anyone can figure out why this won't work in IE? https://jsfiddle.net/w2Lbsxu6/
[16:53:49] <robertBusy> i don't now what ph is.
[16:54:06] <robertBusy> persina what versuion of IE?
[16:54:13] <persina> robertBusy: IE 11
[16:54:30] <s34n> robertBusy: ph is from my early paste: var ph = $('<div>')
[16:54:33] <persina> robertBusy: range should be supported in IE11
[16:54:46] <robertBusy> because it may not support the input event?
[16:54:59] <iDentity1337> I have a question. Why does this script return 'false' twice when the div has the 'active' class toggled off
[16:54:59] <robertBusy> supports change for ranges though.
[16:55:00] <iDentity1337> http://pastebin.com/yAwCe1ds
[16:55:11] <persina> robertBusy: Change won't work either, try it.
[16:55:16] <robertBusy> persina just worked for me.
[16:55:23] <robertBusy> s34n i have no idea dude.  this is why i was looking for a test case.
[16:55:32] <taplar> iDentity1337: looks like your binding in a click handler
[16:55:56] <persina> robertBusy: Oh thought it didn't thanks.
[16:56:04] <robertBusy> persina sure.
[16:56:14] <iDentity1337> how to fix it :|
[16:56:24] <taplar> don't do that
[16:56:30] <taplar> :), only bind once
[16:56:38] <taplar> look into delegate bindings
[16:57:06] <iDentity1337> i'm beginner in jQuery so i have no freaking clue what you just said
[16:57:09] <iDentity1337> i'll just debrief what  I need
[16:57:36] <iDentity1337> On click, toggle class, if class 'active' is added,  run that jSON thing and append, if the class active is removed, hide stuff.
[16:57:40] <iDentity1337> i know how to hide them
[16:57:49] <iDentity1337> and i've appended them successfully
[16:57:51] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[16:57:53] <iDentity1337> but that if statement is causing me problems
[16:57:58] <iDentity1337> since it's returning false twice.
[16:58:10] <robertBusy> and https://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[16:59:04] <taplar> the point being that multiple bindings can result in duplicate processing
[16:59:13] <taplar> so make sure your not doing that
[17:00:40] <taplar> also fwiw, your repeating lookups.  store them in vars and reuse them
[17:01:51] <taplar> it also looks like your appending duplicate ids
[17:01:56] <taplar> which is not valid markup
[17:02:06] <taplar> use a class instead
[17:23:48] <iDentity1337> Still didn't figure this out
[17:23:49] <iDentity1337> -.-
[17:24:18] <iDentity1337> I've tried adding $("#activatesidebar").on("click", "img", function (){ .... }
[17:24:24] <iDentity1337> didn't help again
[17:26:37] <robertBusy> iDentity1337 part of your problem is you're doing $("#sidebar-right").on('transitionend webkitTransitionEnd', function() { inside a $("#activatesidebar").click(function (){
[17:26:45] <robertBusy> don't next event handlers like that - that's a bad idea.
[17:27:01] <iDentity1337> well it has a transition
[17:27:04] <iDentity1337> i don't want data to appear
[17:27:09] <iDentity1337> before the transition ends
[17:27:11] <iDentity1337> like it did before
[17:27:11] <robertBusy> that doesn't change anything about what i just sayd.
[17:27:13] <robertBusy> *said
[17:27:21] <robertBusy> get rid of the $("#activatesidebar").click(function (){ around it.
[17:28:00] <robertBusy> also, you're doing things likje $("#sidebar-friends").append('<img id="sidebar-friends-avatar" ... - you can't append the same id multiple toimes - an id can only appear once on a page.
[17:29:18] <iDentity1337> well that was dumb
[17:29:20] <iDentity1337> nice catch
[17:29:25] <robertBusy> ...
[17:29:33] <robertBusy> taplar told you exactly the same thing earlier >.>
[17:30:19] <iDentity1337> didn't quite understand him >.<
[17:30:38] <taplar> he's a moron anyway
[17:30:54] <robertBusy> heh, that's usually when you ask for clarification :()
[17:30:57] <robertBusy> * :)
[17:31:47] <iDentity1337> well fuck me for doing complicated stuff with 3 days of jQuery experience
[17:31:48] <iDentity1337> xD
[17:31:52] <robertBusy> uh.
[17:32:03] <robertBusy> that's not what i'm implying at all, but OK.
[17:32:28] <taplar> it's a teaching room.  if you don't understand something, ask more questions
[17:32:32] <taplar> we expect it
[17:32:34] <robertBusy> ^^^
[17:33:09] <taplar> granted we may be busy with something so may be in and out, but there are lots of people who can pipe in
[17:33:15] <robertBusy> yep.
[17:34:57] <iDentity1337> thanks :)
[17:35:19] <iDentity1337> Almost got it
[17:38:53] <iDentity1337> http://pastebin.com/5pGPz802 -> if I put that if statement into: $("#sidebar-right").on('transitionend webkitTransitionEnd', function() {, it works
[17:38:59] <iDentity1337> but doesn't hide the data before animation ends
[17:39:02] <iDentity1337> and this doesn't work
[17:39:06] <iDentity1337> that i posted
[17:39:17] <iDentity1337> like literally doesn't show anything after the animation
[17:42:36] <iDentity1337> https://gyazo.com/a2495e0f6f99237c38405f3306e35558 < - (outside the if) | https://gyazo.com/1c71cd8bece5bccc53bf1fe9120d8a58 <- inside the if
[17:42:56] <iDentity1337> mindblow.
[17:43:19] <robertBusy> do you understand how that code works?
[17:43:31] <robertBusy> like, you know the if doesn't automatically "update", right?
[17:43:35] <robertBusy> it reads once when the page loads.
[17:44:03] <vim_shim> howdy! I've got a situation where I'm using jquery-ui to resize a div, but I have a handle outside of it that I want to use. The handle options aren't quite suited to what I need, so I'm trying to proxy click events right now.
[17:44:20] <vim_shim> Am i totally insane, or is there an obivious better way?
[17:45:55] <iDentity1337> I've just noticed that..
[17:49:48] <taplar> vim_shim: so your trying to change/add behavior on a click?
[17:51:03] <vim_shim> taplar: I'm trying to proxy mouse interaction events from my own handle outside of the resizable div, to the ui-handles that the plugin adds.
[17:52:08] <taplar> to do what?
[17:52:54] <vim_shim> taplar: to resize
[17:54:19] <taplar> are you trying to animate a set resize or are you straight up trying to click and drag the mouse else where and it still resize the ui as you drag the mouse?
[17:54:56] <vim_shim> click and drag. jquery-ui expects the handles to be inside of the element the plugin is run on, and you can only pass it css selectors. I'm trying to figure out how to proxy events, and if that's a sane approach.
[17:56:45] <taplar> not sure then.  seems a little strange
[17:59:09] <vim_shim> So, rephrased - is there a good way to proxy all of the click events on one div, and play them on another. Best I've got right now is an .on("click mousedown etc") running a trigger inside.
[17:59:24] <iDentity1337> i'm fucking done
[17:59:30] <iDentity1337> i can't make this work -.-
[17:59:36] <vim_shim> I'll work up a fiddle. brb
[17:59:54] <iDentity1337> taplar the senpai, please help.
[18:00:08] <taplar> i got one minute before i go play in traffic, :)
[18:00:15] <iDentity1337> http://pastebin.com/5pGPz802
[18:00:22] <iDentity1337> Now i understand that code is being run
[18:00:25] <iDentity1337> on page load
[18:00:31] <iDentity1337> how can I get that event
[18:00:38] <iDentity1337> when it happens
[18:00:42] <iDentity1337> toggleClass
[18:01:05] <iDentity1337> and run the rest of this code on the event
[18:01:54] <taplar> let me take a quick looksie
[18:02:50] <taplar> ideally you want to do that binding once, regardless
[18:03:44] <taplar> does it have a parent you can identify?
[18:04:07] <iDentity1337> parent div ?
[18:04:15] <taplar> yep, something that that is a child of
[18:04:29] <taplar> doesn't have to be a div, just a parent
[18:04:30] <iDentity1337> sidebar-wrapper
[18:04:38] <iDentity1337> #sidebar-wrapper
[18:04:40] <taplar> ok, so do your binding on that, using a delegate
[18:05:04] <iDentity1337> how can i do that ? :| sorry i'm a newbie
[18:05:16] <taplar> $("#sidebar-wrapper").on('transitionend webkitTransitionEnd', '#sidebar-right.active', function() {
[18:05:34] <iDentity1337> and then the if statement?
[18:06:00] <taplar> the if would really move into your other handler that is changing the active class
[18:06:05] <taplar> and would only be the false case
[18:06:38] <taplar> what that line above does is attaches an event handler to the sidebar-wrapper
[18:06:48] <taplar> it listens for any event that bubbles up to it from its children
[18:07:00] <taplar> if the event matches that one you gave it
[18:07:00] <iDentity1337> well today i learnt something
[18:07:15] <taplar> and it originated from an element with that id who also has the class active, it will process
[18:07:33] <iDentity1337> but for example
[18:07:37] <iDentity1337> now when i want to hide these
[18:07:37] <iDentity1337> elements
[18:07:55] <iDentity1337> since i see this catches only transition end
[18:07:56] <iDentity1337> on .active
[18:07:57] <taplar> you'll show and hide them in that handler where you toggling the active class
[18:08:32] <taplar> even if you don't hide them, and only remove the active class, that handler will not evaluate it as it doesn't match the filter anymore
[18:08:40] <taplar> '#sidebar-right.active'
[18:10:04] <taplar> clear as mud?
[18:11:02] <z1haze> on my page heres an example: http://testlist.hendricksweb.com/server/4 half the time the footer ends up halfway up the page above the charts, not sure why or how to fix it
[18:11:12] <z1haze> https://gyazo.com/50b39c02bccea730184acb68d7071058 is an example of how it messes up
[18:11:31] <z1haze> the .js-tabs height is rendered from js somehow, and im looking for a way to fix it. any thoughts?
[18:11:39] <iDentity1337> clear
[18:11:41] <iDentity1337> did it
[18:11:43] <z1haze> Im assuming that the tabs plugin is loading before the chart is rendered or something
[18:11:55] <taplar> cool, i'm gonna got play in traffic.  l8r
[18:11:55] <iDentity1337> http://pastebin.com/GMF8BXJK
[18:12:05] <iDentity1337> Maybe that's not the quality code
[18:12:06] <iDentity1337> ever
[18:12:14] <iDentity1337> but hell with that, it works.
[18:14:38] <iDentity1337> cya
[18:14:41] <iDentity1337> l8r
[18:15:31] <z1haze> can I make one call load after another has finished? ie, i want to load my tabs AFTER my charts have loaded, because im getting some weird height issues
[18:25:42] <monoda> I've written a .click() handler for a button to check a group of checkboxes. After all the boxes are marked with checks, they are immediately cleared. I have done e.preventDefault(); at the beginning of my function but it does not make a difference
[18:25:44] <monoda> Any ideas?
[18:25:50] <z1haze> can someone explain how to include functions into my js file when using require
[18:26:55] <z1haze> using browserify to compile everything down
[18:30:13] <arc_> monoda can you reproduce this in a fiddle?
[18:31:13] <monoda> yes, give me one sec
[18:31:36] <shoky> z1haze if you have a module that exports a function then you just  require() it. e.g.  var myfunction = require('./myfunction.js');
[18:33:47] <z1haze> shoky, my function file starts off with module.exports = function(a, b) {
[18:33:56] <z1haze> then in my main js file i do var getGraph = require('getGraph.js');
[18:34:00] <z1haze> is that right?
[18:34:27] <z1haze> throws errrs saying it cant find it, but its there clearly
[18:34:55] <shoky> z1haze:  i just wrote you how
[18:35:19] <z1haze> i dont understand this writing a module that exports a function part
[18:35:31] <z1haze> pretend i just have a file with a single function in it
[18:35:36] <shoky> you did that part fine
[18:35:42] <shoky> you required it wrong
[18:35:45] <z1haze> oh
[18:35:59] <z1haze> does does the ./ matter?
[18:36:03] <shoky> yes
[18:36:24] <z1haze> oh thoght it would look relative
[18:36:46] <shoky> without ./ it would look in node_modules prolly
[18:36:59] <shoky> for an installed module
[18:37:26] <shoky> z1haze btw workaround for your tabs/graph issue to run this when you wanna fix the height:  $('.js-tabs-height').height( $('.tab__item.active').outerHeight() )
[18:37:52] <z1haze> when do i call that though
[18:39:07] <shoky> after you initialize the graph i guess?
[18:39:27] <z1haze> well the graph loads with an async ajax call
[18:39:32] <z1haze> to get its data
[18:39:39] <shoky> yes, after all that
[18:39:49] <z1haze> im not sure how to determine after that
[18:39:58] <z1haze> because in my code i cal the graph before the tabs
[18:40:00] <shoky> how do you know when to initialize the graph
[18:40:10] <shoky> no you don't
[18:40:13] <z1haze> all i do is getGraph(window.server_id, 'players');
[18:40:17] <shoky> you initialize the graph in a $(window).load  i think
[18:40:22] <z1haze> yea i just changed it
[18:40:23] <shoky> and the tabs in a $(document).ready  maybe
[18:40:26] <z1haze> i put everything in the doc ready
[18:40:32] <shoky> and donno what order those are in
[18:40:35] <z1haze> (locally) i havent pushed it yet
[18:40:36] <shoky> oks
[18:40:43] <z1haze> sec
[18:42:09] <z1haze> there ive updated hte live site
[18:42:43] <z1haze> ah shoot hold
[18:44:06] <z1haze> damn i knew i was gong to have this issue
[18:45:33] <z1haze> i moved everything into my app.js and required it, but no i get a stupid highcharts undefined.. let me push it all up and maybe if you can look at it please
[18:47:18] <z1haze> tits live shoky
[18:47:21] <z1haze> its* lol
[18:47:57] <shoky> z1haze seems the same dono
[18:48:11] <shoky> $(window).load(function () {  $(".tabs").tabtab({  ..
[18:48:14] <z1haze> refresh? the error is there it shouldnt even load
[18:48:26] <shoky> o ok
[18:48:30] <shoky> its gone now
[18:48:38] <z1haze> i moved everythging into my main app and used require but for some reason its not able tofind Highcharts now
[18:49:21] <graphettion> Anyone know how to exclude all other special characters except a specific pattern?
[18:49:24] <graphettion> https://jsfiddle.net/graphettion/76pg75dw/
[18:49:44] <graphettion> Or do I have to specify each special character?
[18:50:28] <shoky> z1haze:  you're accessing `Highcharts`  in this line -  return Highcharts.dateFormat("%b %e", this.value);
[18:50:30] <z1haze> shoky, i required Highcharts the way they tell you to in the docs
[18:50:33] <z1haze> yea
[18:50:49] <z1haze> it works if i just include the cdn script in the body of the page
[18:50:56] <shoky> z1haze: i can't see your source code so donno what you did
[18:51:01] <z1haze> but when i try to keep it all in my main file and use require its all broke
[18:51:03] <z1haze> sure 1 sec
[18:51:21] <monoda> I'm having trouble replicating my issue in fiddle
[18:51:50] <monoda> what could cause the effects of an .click() method to be reset immediately afterwards?
[18:51:53] <z1haze> shoky, the relavant bit http://dpaste.com/0V92627
[18:52:10] <robertmaxrees> monoda define "reset"
[18:52:41] <monoda> my function checks a group of boxes and changes the content after the hash in the url
[18:52:42] <shoky> z1haze:  the relevant bit is getGraph.js, that's where you're trying to access Highcharts.  and you probably didnt require() it there
[18:52:58] <z1haze> nope i didnt
[18:53:02] <z1haze> i need to require highcharts there too?
[18:53:03] <monoda> reset means that the boxes become unchecked and the url returns to its previous state
[18:53:08] <shoky> z1haze: you can only access what you require in a file
[18:53:14] <z1haze> wont it be included in my code twice?
[18:53:16] <shoky> no
[18:53:19] <robertmaxrees> monoda is the page reloading?
[18:53:29] <shoky> npm/browserify/require are smart ;p
[18:53:41] <monoda> no
[18:53:44] <z1haze> sweet, so question: do i required it before my moduile.exports =
[18:53:50] <z1haze> or how does it work
[18:53:50] <robertmaxrees> monoda dunno then - i'd have to see it.
[18:53:53] <shoky> you require it before you use it.
[18:54:01] <shoky> usually requires are at the top of the page
[18:54:06] <monoda> I've used a debugger to step through the code
[18:54:07] <shoky> no reason not to follow that
[18:54:13] <shoky> top of the file, i mean
[18:54:14] <z1haze> right, but i wasnt sure what this module.exports = means
[18:54:20] <z1haze> thoght it only exported anything inside that
[18:54:21] <robertmaxrees> monoda can you share the code, even if it's not breaking in a fiddle?
[18:54:25] <monoda> looks like it gets reset at: ret = ( ( jQuery.event.special[ handleObj.origType ] || {} ).handle ||
[18:54:26] <monoda> 						handleObj.handler ).apply( matched.elem, args );
[18:54:28] <shoky> z1haze: that sets what this module's require will be
[18:54:33] <monoda> in the jquery library
[18:54:39] <z1haze> this is really neat stuff
[18:54:47] <shoky> z1haze:   file1.js:  module.exports = 'foo';       other file:    var x = require('./file1');    x === 'foo'
[18:54:53] <robertmaxrees> monoda sounds like you're doing something you don't mean to be then.
[18:55:49] <z1haze> but you said i need to require highcharts in my module.exports = functino() file right?
[18:56:01] <z1haze> like this https://gyazo.com/09bb6fadd020b805341a1266f1ab3539
[18:56:07] <shoky> in getGraph.js, where you're accessing `Highcharts`
[18:56:25] <z1haze> that screenshot is getGraph
[18:56:59] <shoky> and?
[18:57:04] <shoky> i donno what's highstock tho
[18:57:06] <monoda> https://jsfiddle.net/mLbeq2n3/#&togetherjs=RnBLBoQ4yQ
[18:57:09] <z1haze> ive required highcharts there
[18:57:14] <z1haze> well because i use their highstock version
[18:57:17] <shoky> and?
[18:57:17] <z1haze> it has more features
[18:57:21] <z1haze> it still get the error
[18:57:38] <monoda> shows my code, the issue is at line 69
[18:57:41] <z1haze> same error, same location
[18:57:54] <monoda> start at line 69* I believe
[18:58:01] <robertmaxrees> monodo you mean selectbuttons.on("click", function (e) { ?
[18:58:15] <monoda> yes
[18:58:37] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you have logic within that handler to revert changes automatically.
[18:58:56] <shoky> z1haze did you push this live?
[18:59:00] <z1haze> its going now
[18:59:12] <robertmaxrees> monoda try e.stopPropagation(); after that preventDefault() call.
[18:59:16] <z1haze> being slow today
[18:59:32] <monoda> isnt preventDefault supposed to stop propogation as well?
[18:59:38] <robertmaxrees> nope
[18:59:45] <robertmaxrees> it just stops the default action.
[19:00:14] <z1haze> now its live
[19:00:27] <monoda> tried, doesn't change the behavior
[19:00:34] <robertmaxrees> monoda dunno then.
[19:00:46] <robertmaxrees> that's a huge fiddle (shrug)
[19:00:53] <shoky> z1haze:  ok, no error ;p
[19:00:53] <z1haze> looks like the graph is working, but now that its all in one file.. i callthe graphs before i call the tabs, and the sucker still puts the footer in the wrong place
[19:01:34] <shoky> z1haze: you're not calling it before. putting it in visually more up in the code doesnt mean it gets executed before
[19:01:49] <z1haze> yea, well i kinda know that i just dont know what makes it go first
[19:01:50] <shoky> z1haze:  the highcharts is only getting executed much later, after the getJSON is back
[19:01:56] <z1haze> right
[19:01:59] <shoky> so, much much later.
[19:02:15] <z1haze> how can we make sure the tabs load after or at least adjust after
[19:02:19] <shoky> so, call the tabs only after calling .highcharts()
[19:02:28] <shoky> or do my workaround after it, either way
[19:02:43] <z1haze> i saw some example that shows a callback you can run two functions in order
[19:02:48] <z1haze> i didnt quite get the concept though
[19:03:04] <shoky> z1haze:  you don't know where to put code so that it'll run after the getJSON is successful?
[19:03:12] <z1haze> basically
[19:03:22] <shoky> z1haze: because, that's exacrtly where you're initializing .highcharts()
[19:03:36] <z1haze> inside my module then
[19:03:49] <z1haze> wouldnt it be strange to call the tabs inside my getgraph file
[19:04:10] <shoky> how you structure it and name the modules is up to you.
[19:04:15] <shoky> if it's strange, change it
[19:04:25] <z1haze> what if i do some kinda return true from my charts function
[19:04:30] <z1haze> and then when it returns , do that tabs
[19:04:32] <shoky> no.
[19:04:38] <shoky> you can't turn async code into sync
[19:04:47] <robertmaxrees> nor would you want to.
[19:05:11] <z1haze> so you're saying my only option is to do this trickery inside my getgraph module
[19:05:36] <shoky> i also said you can structure it however you want and name it however you want
[19:05:50] <z1haze> what woudl you do :P
[19:05:55] <shoky> you can also use the promises api,
[19:06:06] <shoky> and return the $.getJSON call
[19:06:14] <shoky> e.g.  return $.getJSON(...);
[19:06:17] <ussher_> anyone familiar with the flot charting library?  Im having difficulty passing in json encoded options array in the required format to get one of the examples working.
[19:06:30] <shoky> and then you can call .done(function() { ... })  in the return value
[19:08:02] <shoky> z1haze so maybe do that..  pop a `return` before the $.getJSON(..);   and then in your app.js    var getGraph = require('./getGraph');  ....  getGraph().done(function() { initialize tabs });
[19:08:24] <ussher_> this is the php array thats json encoded: http://pastebin.com/T6vj4CK7  along with its output and the output from the example: http://www.flotcharts.org/flot/examples/axes-multiple/index.html
[19:08:53] <ussher_> cant figure out how to get the yaxis to the correct format.
[19:09:43] <shoky> ussher_ that's the same thing.  that is, the top one is valid JSON, and the bottom one is not. (it's valid JS code but you don't want JS code, you want a JSON string)
[19:10:02] <shoky> i meant it's the same thing in JS, sorry.
[19:10:13] <ussher_> shoky: the bottom one is the format that Flot requires.
[19:10:15] <shoky> ussher_: so you have it at the correct format
[19:10:17] <robertmaxrees> you're missing arrays around some values.
[19:10:24] <shoky> oh
[19:10:34] <ussher_> tried a few things, but none seam to quite get me there.
[19:10:51] <robertmaxrees> it's a php issue :)
[19:11:04] <ussher_> I think its a flot issue if anything,
[19:11:04] <shoky> ussher_ i think everytime you see a []  then you need to put a array( ... ) in php, fwiw
[19:11:39] <ussher_> yeah, its that yaxis format of  {min:0},{alignTicksWithAxis:1,position:"right",tickFormatter: euroFormatter}  that doesnt seam to be directly correlating to json encode
[19:11:40] <shoky> e.g.  array( array( 'mode' => "time" ) )   to get  [ { mode: "time" } ]
[19:12:17] <shoky> ya also  axis/axes ...
[19:12:32] <shoky> or maybe it has both options?
[19:13:15] <ryanneufeld> shoky knows what's up
[19:13:33] <monoda> Figured it out, I had bound the "clear" function to a button in the same div and by mistake it was also attached to the "select all" button
[19:13:47] <ryanneufeld> ussher_: do what shoky said about the array( array() )
[19:14:02] <robertmaxrees> hey mr ryan
[19:14:07] <shoky> tho seems he's using axis vs axes so donno
[19:14:43] <shoky> ah example he linked has axes, nvm
[19:16:54] <ryanneufeld> yo robertmaxrees
[19:16:56] <ryanneufeld> wassup
[19:16:58] <ussher_> sorry, found the problem.  the problem is spelling
[19:17:09] <ussher_> xaxis vs xaxes
[19:17:13] <ryanneufeld> shoky was right again!
[19:17:16] <robertmaxrees> always is.
[19:17:17] <ussher_> damn...
[19:17:20] <ryanneufeld> shoky++
[19:17:28] <ussher_> thanks.  sorry for wasting your time
[19:17:28] <ryanneufeld> like i said, he knows his isht
[19:17:41] <ryanneufeld> ussher_: you must be canadian
[19:17:48] <ussher_> new zealand
[19:18:07] <taplar> close enough
[19:18:09] <ussher_> like canadians though. :)
[19:18:20] <ryanneufeld> Ah, Canadians of the southern hemisphere
[19:18:45] <ryanneufeld> New Zealand is still on my bucket list
[19:19:13] <robertmaxrees> same here.
[19:19:17] <ussher_> great place if you like countryside.  loads of it here.  in a bubble right now, so hold off, everythings expensive.
[19:20:20] <ryanneufeld> sounds like everywhere on the planet
[19:20:34] <ryanneufeld> how long till all us peasants rise up and just take what we want from the 1%?
[19:21:37] <taplar> doesn't really sound like a jquery question
[19:21:44] <ussher_> :)
[19:21:56] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[19:22:07] <ryanneufeld> so sue me :p
[19:28:16] <eNull> Hey
[19:28:32] <taplar> domo
[19:28:36] <robertmaxrees> hullo
[19:28:47] <eNull> How i can select $(this) img and change src
[19:28:58] <eNull> in $(this) there is no another img
[19:28:59] <robertmaxrees> $(this).attr('src', 'lol');
[19:29:00] <eNull> only one
[19:29:05] <robertmaxrees> oh, .find()
[19:29:08] <eNull> -.-
[19:29:14] <shoky> taplar: hope you know doumo means 'thanks' ;p
[19:29:16] <eNull> find('img)
[19:29:48] <taplar> lol
[19:30:01] <taplar> i'm just being super friendly i guess
[19:30:04] <shoky> lol
[19:30:30] <taplar> i need to find a new one
[19:30:48] <shoky> douzo would be a bit more appropriate. assuming you're going for japanese
[19:31:33] <taplar> hmm, thought that was kon'nichiwa
[19:31:50] <taplar> ah!
[19:31:51] <ussher_> or osu for karate buddy japanese
[19:31:53] <taplar> ni hao!
[19:32:04] <shoky> heh  ni hao is chinese
[19:32:33] <taplar> that's gonna be my new one
[19:32:41] <shoky> hao.
[19:33:28] <taplar> interesting
[19:35:02] <z1haze> shoky, reading what you said, its not so clear to me though
[19:35:44] <z1haze> i thought you said i cant this cause its async
[19:37:18] <z1haze> shoky, like this? http://dpaste.com/20R3JX0
[19:40:05] <z1haze> hellyea, works man thank you
[19:45:32] <eNull> how i can force element to be hover.
[19:45:32] <eNull> ?
[19:45:47] <taplar> what do you mean?
[19:46:25] <eNull> Like I've <div></div> but the pointer is not pointing to it.
[19:46:38] <taplar> oh, you want to change the mouse pointer?
[19:46:42] <eNull> no no
[19:46:57] <eNull> i want a div act like it's hovered
[19:47:25] <eNull> div { background: white; } div:hover{ background: red; }
[19:47:38] <taplar> that should work
[19:47:40] <eNull> i want that div to be acting like hovered. to have red background while t's not hovered
[19:47:47] <taplar> and more of a ##css question
[19:48:06] <eNull> like $(div).forceHover()
[19:48:50] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/0tjep9rv/
[19:49:36] <taplar> it's background-color, btw
[19:49:43] <eNull> taplar u missed my question
[19:49:45] <eNull> answer is
[19:49:54] <eNull> $("div").trigger("mouseover");
[19:50:01] <taplar> my answer is you shouldn't do it with js
[19:50:04] <taplar> it's a css issue
[19:50:20] <eNull> It's css man
[19:50:32] <eNull> it's how to force hover state within jQuery
[19:50:55] <eNull> Anyway thanks <#
[19:50:55] <arc_> trigger mouseover will only trigger an already bound event listener, it doesn't do anything with css hover state
[19:50:56] <eNull> <#
[22:39:45] <fas3r> Hello
[23:07:52] <z1haze> i dont think so, i use it too but i had to manually solve that problem onthe server side
[23:07:55] <z1haze> fas3r, ^
[23:14:19] <fas3r> z1haze: could you tell me how if you remember ?
[23:14:37] <z1haze> sure
[23:14:40] <fas3r> it should return something different than an emtpy aray ?
[23:14:54] <z1haze> let me first make sure i know what you're asking
[23:14:55] <fas3r> z1haze: thanks :D
[23:14:59] <fas3r> really appreciate
[23:15:10] <z1haze> you want to disallow someone to input their own options and submit right?
[23:16:00] <z1haze> ie you have a list of tags that you allow your users to choose, and if they put something thats not in your list, you want to deny it
[23:16:19] <fas3r> z1haze: https://select2.github.io/examples.html#tags     in the example, there is no 'black' color for example. I want to prevent the user to be able to tag it.
[23:16:39] <fas3r> z1haze: yes :)
[23:16:48] <fas3r> we are on the same page :)
[23:16:50] <z1haze> sure
[23:16:58] <z1haze> so when you validate their tags list or whaever
[23:17:10] <z1haze> compare it against an array or collection of valid options
[23:18:18] <z1haze> foreach tags as tag { if(!in_array(tag, validTags) return false;
[23:18:34] <z1haze> translate that into whatever backend language you're using
[23:18:38] <fas3r> I did that actually already, like if the value does not have id ( as it's not from a valid option) then it exclude it.
[23:18:46] <fas3r> but I wanted to do that on client side.
[23:18:57] <fas3r> Like really showing "No results Found".
[23:19:04] <z1haze> you should definitely not be validating anything on the client side
[23:19:15] <z1haze> nothing thats important
[23:19:18] <fas3r> it's not validating.. :)
[23:19:34] <z1haze> as it's not from a valid option) then it exclude it.
[23:19:42] <z1haze> its not?
[23:19:52] <fas3r> no
[23:20:07] <fas3r> the default behave of tagging is to tag what the user type
[23:20:24] <z1haze> you can also pass an array of values
[23:20:27] <z1haze> that are available options
[23:20:41] <fas3r> "Note that when tagging is enabled the user can select from pre-existing options or create a new tag by picking the first choice"
[23:21:12] <fas3r> well I lookup with ajax in a database, it's not a list of options
[23:21:25] <z1haze> maybe https://select2.github.io/examples.html#data-ajax
[23:21:33] <fas3r> yes
[23:21:48] <fas3r> but the default behave of tagging is to tag what ever you type ...
[23:22:00] <fas3r> so it's jquery side... not server side.
[23:22:16] <z1haze> this doesnt let you pick whatever you want..
[23:22:24] <z1haze> it only lets you choose from the options in their list
[23:22:42] <fas3r> not with tagging
[23:23:13] <fas3r> https://select2.github.io/examples.html#tags     in the example, there is no 'black' color in the list and it will tag it anyway
[23:23:24] <z1haze> im away..
[23:23:25] <z1haze> aware*
[23:23:36] <z1haze> i know what you want
[23:23:46] <z1haze> i just gave you an alternative solution because thelib doesnt seem to support that
[23:24:45] <fas3r> I will check if there is an event when it's tagging.
[23:24:48] <fas3r> maybe ... :D
[23:28:21] <z1haze> maybe select2:selecting
[23:28:29] <z1haze> return false if its not one of yours
[23:56:28] <z1haze> can you check screen size in em with jquery?
[23:57:12] <z1haze> something wild like $(window).width() / parseFloat($("body").css("font-size")); ?
