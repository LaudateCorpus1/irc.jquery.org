[00:00:02] <daslicht> and if someone has no js enabled we could just serve teh static snapshots
[00:00:41] <daslicht> the only big issue i have with js atm is that it is anything else than easy to mannage
[00:00:49] <daslicht> compared to real oop languages
[00:02:42] <jstonne> I would still think there's an issue with dealing with the templates.
[00:03:08] <daslicht> i bet
[00:03:14] <daslicht> :)
[00:03:32] <daslicht> i am still searching for a solution as well
[00:04:06] <daslicht> seen wakanda.org ? quite interesting
[00:05:56] <jstonne> ooh interesting, it looks like aptana's attempt on jaxer…. or NodeJS repackaged with express and all that.
[00:06:05] <daslicht> jup
[00:06:27] <daslicht> u can even wrap jQuery UI in it as far as i have seen
[00:08:30] <geoid> I'm trying to figure out whether this is a joke or not: https://github.com/madrobby/vapor.js
[00:09:00] <jstonne> I wished PHP extinct soon… and perhaps a apache module for nodeJS.. just something to get it to the mainstream…
[00:09:00] <daslicht> lol
[00:09:27] <daslicht> i hope something better than js comes up :)
[00:09:33] <jstonne> hahaha
[00:09:36] <daslicht> strict typing , real oop
[00:09:52] <daslicht> http://www.dartlang.org/
[00:09:55] <daslicht> interesting
[00:10:16] <jstonne> Crockford didn't like Dart… at all.
[00:10:38] <smurfke> feels too much java to me
[00:10:52] <jstonne> Haha VaporJS looks like a joke.
[00:10:58] <daslicht> ha i love java
[00:11:32] <daslicht> java is  so much more joy developing than js , js feels like blind coding :)
[00:12:06] <daslicht> as3 would be perfect for the web
[00:12:20] <daslicht> as3 + mxml but without the flash player :)
[00:12:24] <jstonne> I like JS the way it is really :P
[00:12:40] <Zerxer> hm I see that the jquery .submit() function on a form lets it skip past the browser html5 form validation :(
[00:13:03] <daslicht> me not :)
[00:13:08] <daslicht> i like oop
[00:14:00] <jstonne> i like function-level scopes.. it works.. for js.. very well. oop is too rigid.
[00:14:21] <daslicht> but this rigit structure lest u built BIG reuseable apps
[00:14:37] <daslicht> ok if u create a simple homepage with some pages js is very nice and fast
[00:14:48] <daslicht> but try building a cms or bigger things
[00:15:02] <daslicht> and try to maintain the "classes" after some month
[00:15:03] <daslicht> :)
[00:15:06] <daslicht> nightmare
[00:15:10] <Zerxer> amen
[00:15:34] <geoid> ya.. that's what I'm trying to avoid.
[00:16:00] <geoid> I'm already starting to separate UI code from ajax code myself, which is really MVC in pyjamas.
[00:16:12] <geoid> Might look better in a miniskirt.
[00:16:55] <daslicht> :)
[00:17:03] <daslicht> same here
[00:17:10] <daslicht> its all possible , no quetion
[00:17:11] <nardev> hello i have ajax request $("#some_textbox_id").load(loadUrl); and i want in separate div to load first loading image and than AFTER loading is done to load "LOADED" message or just to remove Loading image, how to trigger $('#loading-div').html(content); after loading is done?
[00:17:13] <jstonne> sounds good geoid.
[00:17:16] <gernatech> this discussion should be logged
[00:17:23] <daslicht> but i am not very comfortable how its solved
[00:17:33] <jstonne> gernatech: it's logged.
[00:17:43] <geoid> miniskirtMVC... coming soon to a nightclub near you.
[00:17:44] <gernatech> jstonne : (: beautiful
[00:17:55] <jstonne> gernatech: http://irc.jquery.com
[00:17:59] <gernatech> haha miniskirtMVC, I'll use it if it really created
[00:18:51] <gernatech> jstonne : Nice !!
[00:19:58] <geoid> what does it mean to "compile templates to javascript before use"?
[00:19:59] <jstonne> nardev: You might want to consider binding to the load event on the image element after you have retrieve the html content.
[00:20:34] <jstonne> geoid: yeah wtf does that mean lol?
[00:20:46] <geoid> I don't get this "compile to javascript" bit.. seeing it in various places
[00:21:01] <nardev> jstonne, :) i found the way, yes i do that before and after it's done i just fount the way .loac(URL, function(){do something after load :D})
[00:21:26] <jstonne> nardev: okay.
[00:21:28] <geoid> http://jquerysbestfriends.com/#slide35
[00:22:06] <geoid> http://jquerysbestfriends.com/#slide36
[00:22:06] <geoid> http://jquerysbestfriends.com/#slide37
[00:22:12] <geoid> does it just mean caching?
[00:23:27] <jstonne> geoid: I think it might be related to RequireJS's optimizer tool.
[00:23:53] <jstonne> I think it converts templates into javascript codes, so no more parsing on the client side.
[00:25:36] <daslicht> a js singleton can only exist until the next page refresh right ?
[00:28:40] <Zerxer> darn, setting the 'form' attribute on a button element that's outside of the form doesn't set that button to submit the form
[00:28:44] <Zerxer> was hoping it'd work like that 
[00:29:47] <jstonne> daslicht: err yeah.
[00:30:14] <StPiere> i have slected links like this: $links = $('a')... how do i select all anchors with index > 0 ... i want to do this $links.gt(0) , but there is not method gt ... (dont want this $('a:gt(0)')) ...
[00:31:31] <Zerxer> StPiere: try $links.filter(':gt(0)')
[00:31:40] <StPiere> thanks
[00:33:04] <jstonne> StPiere: .eq() is much simpler.  $links.eq(3);
[00:35:04] <Zerxer> though if he wants them all except the first one, for whatever reason, that'd still only grab one
[00:35:28] <StPiere> yep
[00:35:52] <Zerxer> you could use .slice(1)
[00:36:04] <Zerxer> forgot about that
[00:41:16] <rknLA> is there a convenient way to get the new field value of a keyup event in the callback?  i googled and couldn't find much
[00:42:12] <geoid> rknLA ev.target()?
[00:42:48] <rknLA> oh weird.
[00:42:50] <jstonne> you mean… $('.yout-input').keyup(function(){ $(this).val()  });  ?
[00:42:56] <rknLA> for a while that didn't have the right value, but now it does =\
[00:43:45] <rknLA> event.target.value had it correct
[00:44:39] <beasty> mm how do i change the value of a radio input ?
[00:52:06] <sente> beasty: http://sente.cc/stu/dev/radio.html
[00:52:33] <sente> beasty: I made that awhile ago to help someone else, perhaps from there you can see what'd be needed?
[00:54:44] <geoid> what's an easy way to get all the attributes of a collection?
[00:54:49] <geoid> Can that be done with selectors?
[00:55:40] <geoid> so for example I want to collect all the "name" attributes from this array of elements $('.myclass')
[00:56:56] <Che-Anarc> What is the proper way to .add(html) to DOM? - I'm trying to use jCarousel and when adding all elements dynamically via $("main").append(html); break transitions... where as when I pre-populate containers and then populate them its ok.... what am I doing wrong?
[00:57:10] <sente> names=[]; $('.myclass').each(function(){var ourval=$(this).name; names.push(ourval);});
[00:57:19] <sente> geoid: ^--- perhaps that
[00:57:21] <sente> untested
[00:57:27] <gernatech> lets see
[00:57:52] <gernatech> would u need to do an .attr on ur selector ?
[00:58:08] <gernatech> wouldnt*
[00:58:27] <gernatech> var ourval=$(this).attr("name");
[00:58:28] <geoid> Che-Anarc use callbacks to make sure your elements exist in DOM before listeners are added to them.
[00:58:53] <imc> hello
[00:58:57] <gernatech> hi imc
[00:59:07] <Che-Anarc> geoid    any chance you can give me a link to read on that?
[00:59:18] <Che-Anarc> Sorry I'm rather new to jQuery.
[00:59:28] <imc> I'm fighting to make jquery.mobile and History.js to do each one their thing... is this even possible?
[01:00:17] <geoid> Che-Anarc nothing comes to mind no... but think of it like this...  any element you want to add an event to, or select, using jQuery must exist in the DOM before you can use it. Good place to start: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[01:00:38] <geoid> http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Introducing_$(document).ready()
[01:00:40] <imc> is history management something on which jquery.mobile deeply relies? (i.e. is what i'm trying to do simply impossible?)
[01:01:12] <gernatech> geoid : did you try sente's suggestion ?
[01:01:15] <sente> gernatech: yes, you're right
[01:01:36] <geoid> gernatech I'm trying something with map() currently.. just occurred to me
[01:02:07] <gernatech> geoid : oh sweet.
[01:02:19] <sente> names=[]; $('img').each(function(){names.push(($(this).attr('src')));});  // <--- this works
[01:02:32] <gernatech> thats even better
[01:02:39] <gernatech> haha saves code
[01:03:01] <gernatech> reading documentation at this time of the day just don't seem to be helpful at all
[01:03:17] <geoid> Che-Anarc keep in mind that javascript is largely asynchronous when it comes to events. So if you say...  $('myelement').load(url);  console.log($(#'myLoadedElement')); ... your console.log will be empty, because it doesn't wait for .load to finish.
[01:03:17] <sente> gernatech: isn't it mid afternoon over there?
[01:03:55] <gernatech> its actually 5pm
[01:04:00] <gernatech> I'm an hr away from finishing work
[01:04:21] <gernatech> But theres a project that involves wordpress, buddy press and event press
[01:04:29] <gernatech> and I'm pressing hard on reading the documentation
[01:04:30] <gernatech> LOL
[01:04:39] <sente> never heard of buddy or event press
[01:04:41] <sente> but good luck
[01:04:44] <geoid> Che-Anarc so you need to use a callback function. E.g. http://www.google.co.za/search?ix=sea&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8&q=jquery+.load
[01:04:45] <geoid> As a second argument to .load you can pass in a function, which will then execute only when the load is compelete.
[01:04:47] <geoid> Hope that helps!
[01:05:26] <gernatech> thanks sente, anw they are just plugins for wp, community building plugins
[01:07:10] <Che-Anarc> geoid   var div_c = '<ul id="pCarousel" class="jcarousel-skin-dk"><ul>'; $("#main").append(div_c);   ... then like you said I'm waiting appending with function when pCarousel is ready... but still the same behavior:  http://pastebin.com/DT0geAUS
[01:08:16] <geoid> sente & gernatech I ended up using this to collect the attributes: var selected = jQuery('.ui-selected').map(function() {
[01:08:17] <geoid>           return jQuery(this).attr("task_id")
[01:08:17] <geoid>         }).get();
[01:09:47] <geoid> Che-Anarc your .ready wrapper isn't correct I don't think
[01:11:02] <sente> geoid: that's elegant, better than my solution
[01:11:10] <geoid> have you put a console.log($("#pCarousel")); inside it, or just before it? see if you can select your element. If not, it don't exist.
[01:11:15] <geoid> Che-Anarc
[01:12:16] <Che-Anarc> geoid  well it sows up 1 part of element & the others are there too just with distorted layout & no transitions
[01:12:52] <geoid> Che-Anarc where is the carousel code?
[01:13:23] <geoid> ok I see it up top.
[01:14:11] <romario333> Hi, is here anybody who can do something with jQuery's bug tracker? I've just spent about 15 minutes just trying to get around its anti-spam check when entering new ticket :(
[01:14:12] <geoid> I would guess that what's happening is that your jquery.carousel has got it's own $(document).ready() function in it which listens for your id. You are only creating the carousel after that already runs.
[01:14:23] <StPiere> by initiating a plugin, im using scrollLeft to adjust element's position .... it seems that in chrome after visibility of elements is changed (hide -> show again) .. the element is scrolled to initial position ... in mozilla it stays where it was before hiding ... anyone know this issue ?
[01:14:57] <geoid> Che-Anarc so the point is that if you are going to load your carousel container dynamically, then you need to manually instantiate pcarousel's code after that.
[01:15:21] <geoid> Currently your carousel code is executing on a DOM that doesn't contain the carousel wrapper element.
[01:16:28] <Che-Anarc> geoid  I think I understand... any chance you can exemplify wrapper on my code?
[01:17:34] <Kingsy> anyone in here used the nivo slider before?
[01:18:11] <nardev> i use most simplest ajax load like this: $("#load_btn").click(function(){$("#load_div").load(loadUrl);});  first time it loads content properly but when i click it another time it does nothing, it doesn't reload it? Although in XHR in firebug i see that request is fired and data got but it doesn't populate div?
[01:18:14] <Che-Anarc> geoid   I actually another .js which is doing that:  http://pastebin.com/KjkasPtR
[01:19:17] <geoid> Che-Anarc so why not use that?
[01:21:37] <geoid> Che-Anarc something like this: http://pastebin.com/swZwwz34
[01:26:14] <Kingsy> has anyone in here used two instantances of a nivo slider but they are both controlled by one set of control buttons?
[01:31:15] <nardev> anyone?
[01:35:01] <claudio> nardev, with firebug check also the content of the response
[01:35:23] <claudio> nardev, it could be the *same* one of the previous request, thus nothing seems to change
[01:36:27] <JKarsrud> Kingsy: nope, I wrote my own slider instead to handle it
[01:37:43] <Kingsy> JKarsrud: is it yours personally or did you release it opensource?
[01:37:55] <nardev> claudio, it should actually load content into textbox and when i erase content from textbox i still see it in html present
[01:38:09] <JKarsrud> not opensources yet, unfortunately
[01:38:13] <JKarsrud> sourced*
[01:38:21] <nardev> claudio, is there a difference if i load it in div vs. textbox?
[01:38:29] <claudio> nardev, yes
[01:38:36] <claudio> nardev, use a div
[01:38:37] <JKarsrud> Kingsy: I don't remeber what kind of events/functions nivo exposes tho, it might be possible now
[01:38:55] <nardev> claudio, it must be editable :/
[01:39:00] <claudio> nardev, browsers do weird stuff with form control state
[01:39:16] <Kingsy> JKarsrud: I cant see a way of doing it..
[01:39:43] <nardev> claudio, i need to load some content and user should add some more, that is why i need to load it in textbox ?
[01:39:59] <claudio> nardev, so use a simple $.get('...', function( data ) { populate my textbox })
[01:40:00] <Kingsy> JKarsrud: as an example --> http://pastie.org/3136414 <-- that is the code that is used in t he plugin to switch the slide using the control nav
[01:40:27] <nardev> claudio, lets try :)
[01:41:01] <JKarsrud> Kingsy: well, then you could try to trigger the click event on the .nivo-controlNav a
[01:41:06] <JKarsrud> don't know if it works
[01:41:15] <JKarsrud> there was a reason that I started writing my own
[01:43:34] <Kingsy> JKarsrud: but how would you call the event? thats what I am trying to figure out
[01:46:39] <Che-Anarc> geoid   I tridd that method too... calling the jQuery(document).ready(function()  manually after everything is inserted... but its still performing the same.
[01:48:04] <geoid> Dunno then Che-Anarc welcome to jQuery. It can get tricky when you are trying to rewire plugins.
[01:48:28] <geoid> guys, is there a way to call a method who's name is contained in a variable?
[01:48:41] <geoid> call a function even
[01:49:44] <geoid> so for example...
[01:49:44] <geoid> var method = 'prepend';
[01:49:44] <geoid> jQuery('#mydingus')[method];
[01:49:44] <geoid> would that work?
[01:50:31] <claudio> geoid, what has it to do with jQuery?
[01:50:50] <geoid> prepend, append is jQuery :D
[01:51:08] <claudio> anyway, yes.
[01:51:27] <geoid> doesn't seem to work :(
[01:52:13] <geoid> oh wait! ....  it does :)
[01:52:29] <JKarsrud> Kingsy: $('.nivo-controlNav a').trigger('click') :)
[01:53:02] <nardev> claudio, it seems that if i add space before and after string that is being loaded, it doesn't have problem with reloading :) any idea?
[01:54:38] <claudio> nardev, as I said, browsers do weird staff with form controls state.
[01:54:57] <claudio> most of them are predictable, some are not.
[01:55:38] <claudio> (I wouldn't rely on a "adding a space will fix it, apparently")
[01:55:46] <nardev> claudio, what should i do in your opinion? :( i have to make it editable
[01:55:47] <Kingsy> JKarsrud: no idea.. it doesnt work simply pasting that in the onclick with the correct classnames and ids
[01:56:22] <claudio> nardev, man, I already said. Use $.get ... get your data, update the textarea
[01:56:40] <JKarsrud> Kingsy: exactly,
[01:56:44] <silv3r_m00n> I have a function that I need to execute inside every success handler of every jquery request in the first line , how can I do this ?
[01:56:50] <nardev> claudio, i did i change everything
[01:56:51] <JKarsrud> which is why I ended up creating my own
[01:56:56] <claudio> nardev, load() is only a shortcut for a get() (that is a shortcut for the ajax())
[01:56:59] <nardev> claudio, but result is same
[01:57:01] <claudio> nardev, good luck :)
[01:57:15] <claudio> nardev, no it's not.
[01:57:32] <claudio> nardev, beacuse $('#mytextare').val("anything") will work
[01:57:47] <JKarsrud> ?ajaxSuccess @ silv3r_m00n
[01:57:48] <bot-t> silv3r_m00n, .ajaxSuccess(handler): Attach a function to be executed whenever an Ajax request completes successfully. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxSuccess/
[01:57:50] <claudio> (and "anything" is what you are getting from the server, via the $.get)
[01:58:02] <nardev> claudio, look http://paste.debian.net/151196/
[01:58:41] <nardev> aaaa claudio you mean to use val for populating.. ok..
[01:58:46] <claudio> nardev, eh
[01:59:03] <claudio> do not use "html" if you already have the textarea
[01:59:14] <nardev> claudio, ok ok thnx
[02:00:11] <silv3r_m00n> JKarsrud: if I use ajaxsuccess , then which function will be executed first the ajaxSuccess one or the one which is in the success attribute of a particular $.ajax call
[02:02:06] <avisual> aaronmcadam: your skypes down
[02:07:13] <silv3r_m00n> inside ajaxSuccess handler is it possible to prevent the execution of the success handler of the specific ajax request ?
[02:09:44] <JKarsrud> silv3r_m00n: the ajaxsuccess will run first I think
[02:10:07] <JKarsrud> dunno if the specific one is even run, I haven't done any ajax in a long time
[02:10:18] <silv3r_m00n> JKarsrud: yes it is running first as I tested , but I also need the option to stop further success handlers inside ajaxSuccess
[02:10:28] <JKarsrud> return false, maybe?
[02:10:56] <Mehrdad> how do u assign the runtime-added members of an object to another one of the same type?
[02:11:07] <Mehrdad> no prototype
[02:15:31] <jstonne> hi all
[02:16:36] <jstonne> Mehrdad: How are the objects created?
[02:17:39] <Mehrdad> for a moment thought i just fixed it by assigning the other instance to this one, but one bug  still persists
[02:17:41] <Mehrdad> :(
[02:17:53] <Mehrdad> one is a function
[02:18:12] <Mehrdad> other one is a prototype-syle object
[02:18:19] <Mehrdad> they are Date objects
[02:18:42] <nocturne7> do you guys know how to $.post an associative array to  a spring mvc controller ?
[02:18:46] <Mehrdad> a function in a lowe level of hierarchy is assigned to the Date object
[02:19:13] <Mehrdad> and this Date object in the higher level gets some runtime members
[02:19:16] <Mehrdad> and prototypes
[02:19:40] <jstonne> Mehrdad: The date object again haha :-)
[02:20:19] <neary> Hello
[02:20:24] <Mehrdad> yeah it is crazy i think for a moment everything is ok and then another  bug comes up :(
[02:20:50] <neary> is there a way to get Cookie header from a cross domain request (sent from file://...) ?
[02:20:50] <neary> is there a way to get Cookie Response Header from a cross domain request (sent from file://...) ?
[02:20:52] <Mehrdad> what does this error mean? attempt to run compile-and-go script on a cleared scope
[02:20:55] <claudio> nocturne7, "post an associative array" makes no sense. Everything will be form encoded anyway
[02:21:04] <neary> oops sorry for repetition
[02:21:38] <claudio> nocturne7, a=3&b=t&foo=bar ... is the server responsability to assemble that on whatever suits
[02:23:38] <Mehrdad> it is the damn datejs library
[02:23:39] <nocturne7> claudio: right now I am able pass string from jquery to a spring controller, but I wish I could pass a string array and receive it as String[] str on the controller side
[02:23:47] <Mehrdad> a jquery plugin conflicts with it
[02:24:14] <Mehrdad> there are a bunch of methods defined in the datejs that are not prototype
[02:24:19] <Mehrdad> they are volatile
[02:24:24] <claudio> nocturne7, it depends on the server convention... like in PHP something like a[]=1
[02:24:30] <Mehrdad> and the jquery plugin needs access to them
[02:24:43] <claudio> nocturne7, I think it's merely a naming convention, not jquery related
[02:24:56] <claudio> but I'm not a Java guy :)
[02:26:53] <ervine> I have a twitter button in a lightbox (fancybox specifically). First time I open the lightbox the button is there. But second time the twitter iframe src changes to about:blank. Presumably something to do with the lighbox content being moved around the DOM. Anyone got any thoughts?
[02:45:11] <risky_s> hi, how do I validate a ul list, similar to a select box?
[02:47:35] <slide> I'm dynamically creating some checkboxes and adding them to the page but i cant seem to check/uncheck them anyone have any idea?
[02:49:39] <sj26> slide: $("input[type=checkbox]").prop("checked", true/false)
[02:49:57] <sj26> risky_s: validate how?
[02:50:27] <slide> sj26, that checks them, but i cant uncheck them
[02:50:33] <risky_s> i am using the jquery validate plugin
[02:50:38] <slide> and i mean by actually clicking the mouse on them
[02:51:05] <risky_s> i have a dropdown select box which is make of ul li, its dynamically transformed to that with a select plugin
[02:56:02] <James13433> anybody fancy helping me with a line of prototype.js?
[02:57:38] <nicholasschulz> Do most people have javascript enabled in their browser? Im using a lot of jQuery on my website and I'm wondering if I need to create a "backup"-solution for those who still don't use JS...
[02:58:16] <slide> aha figured it out, something was messing with the zindex.....
[03:17:42] <delinquent> good day to all jquerians
[03:18:50] <delinquent> this is not working for me
[03:18:55] <delinquent> anyone read this
[03:18:56] <delinquent> ?
[03:40:10] <JamesTaylor> Hi all, how would i restrict the following code to only affect the closest "long" class : http://jsfiddle.net/NVadV/3/
[03:41:43] <Anime`> by closest you mean first?
[03:41:55] <JamesTaylor> yes :)
[03:42:01] <Anime`> http://jsfiddle.net/NVadV/4/
[03:42:38] <Anime`> you can put first inside to match what you wanna happen too
[03:45:13] <JamesTaylor> thanks , i'm nearly there, i only want the div under the div that is clicked to be displayed though, this could be any of the divs, it's basically a simple expander for the short text
[03:47:44] <Anime`> http://jsfiddle.net/NVadV/6/
[03:54:19] <JamesTaylor> Thanks Anime, i changed it slightly to my needs , it's perfect ! thnaks again : http://jsfiddle.net/NVadV/7/

[04:00:05] <Peeter> Hello, does anyone know of a project that allows me to send javascript commands to my mobile browser? (Basically remote debugging)
[04:17:37] <axelS> hi all
[04:18:24] <axelS> I'm trying to figure out how to remove only certain options from a select menu with jquery
[04:18:51] <axelS> looked and found several tips but they all say i need to clear the select menu completely and then re-add options I want?
[04:25:52] <lduros> I need to find a tags that contain text that starts with a certain word, what would I use to do that?
[04:26:02] <lduros> I meant <a> tags
[04:32:31] <lrvick> So jquery binds are simply not behaving how i expect on a re-draw from a cached array. Here is a test case to explain what I mean: http://jsfiddle.net/BTUDB/18/
[04:32:34] <lrvick> Any ideas?
[04:56:22] <sravan> hi
[04:56:29] <sravan> good morning
[04:56:31] <sravan> anyone here?
[04:56:34] <lrvick> meep
[04:58:09] <sravan> I have site that was done in dojo and I have move most part into jquery.  But I have a dojo widget I would still like to use ... everything seems fine until I apply dojo theme to the widget. Its screwing all my other css on the site. Any ideas>
[04:58:10] <sravan> ?
[04:58:42] <Jon47> sravan - it's not what you're looking for
[04:58:50] <Jon47> but i'd say that having two frameworks on a site is a bad idea
[04:59:17] <Jon47> especially a large one like dojo - you're making your users load the entire library for a single widget?
[04:59:34] <sravan> I know, I want to use it for only one 1 page
[04:59:57] <Jon47> actually i haven't used dojo in years
[05:00:08] <Jon47> sounds like they have a modular loader approach that keeps it pretty slim these days
[05:00:34] <sravan> yes I am using the modularized one, but css is making it bad
[05:00:49] <Jon47> can we look at the site?  css issues are usually pretty easy to fix
[05:11:13] <oliver_1> hi
[05:11:33] <oliver_1> is there a way to embed the entire Jquery code directly into a HTML document?
[05:11:55] <jstonne> what are you talking about? not using <script> tag?
[05:12:02] <oliver_1> I want to create a self-contained HTML file which shall be usable even if no internet is available
[05:12:21] <jstonne> so just a single html file?
[05:12:26] <oliver_1> xyes
[05:12:27] <oliver_1> yes
[05:12:53] <jstonne> yeah well copy the whole jquery code out and wrap it in <script></script> then
[05:13:22] <oliver_1> ok... :-) I wasn't sure if that's supported, or if there's a better way
[05:17:20] <lrvick> So jquery binds are simply not behaving how i expect on a re-draw from a cached array. Here is a test case to explain what I mean: http://jsfiddle.net/BTUDB/18/
[05:17:22] <lrvick> Any ideas?
[05:19:37] <blackspotwiggins> lrvick, you are better off using event delegation
[05:19:59] <blackspotwiggins> attach the event on the container instead of all the items
[05:20:06] <blackspotwiggins> so when you add/remove any, it still works
[05:20:10] <blackspotwiggins> with one handler
[05:20:28] <lrvick> blackspotwiggins: well in my actual situation
[05:20:30] <lrvick> every single item
[05:20:36] <lrvick> will have to ahve tis own unique bind
[05:20:49] <lrvick> its*
[05:22:04] <blackspotwiggins> lrvick, i think empty() removes all the event handlers as well
[05:22:41] <blackspotwiggins> "To avoid memory leaks, jQuery removes other constructs such as data and event handlers from the child elements before removing the elements themselves."
[05:23:04] <lrvick> strange, but as you see im storing copies of all the fully jquery objects
[05:23:04] <blackspotwiggins> so i'd suggest to refactor to using delegation or rebinding
[05:23:06] <lrvick> in an array
[05:23:08] <lrvick> then rebuilding
[05:23:13] <lrvick> so i dont understand how its deleting it from the dom
[05:23:17] <lrvick> AND from my array
[05:23:41] <blackspotwiggins> empty() implicitly calls destroy() on children, i think
[05:23:51] <blackspotwiggins> if you want to preserve them, then call detach()
[05:23:52] <blackspotwiggins> that might wokr
[05:23:55] <blackspotwiggins> work*
[05:24:03] <lrvick> ah!
[05:24:06] <lrvick> now there is an idea
[05:24:08] * lrvick trys
[05:24:36] <lrvick> detach works!
[05:24:38] <lrvick> problem soled
[05:24:43] * lrvick hugs blackspotwiggins
[05:27:17] <lrvick> blackspotwiggins: that worked in my real use case too
[05:27:20] <lrvick> http://new.lrvick.net/js/jquery-picasagallery/demo.html
[05:27:23] <lrvick> working galleryness
[05:28:56] <blackspotwiggins> lrvick, watch out for memory leaks tho
[05:29:07] <blackspotwiggins> and it will get slow with a large number of items/galleries
[05:29:36] <lrvick> whats my best option to making it faster?
[05:29:42] <lrvick> rebuilding the elements from scratch every time?
[05:32:08] <Gao> i hate javascript it's such a dick
[05:32:20] <lrvick> ...
[05:32:53] <blackspotwiggins> lrvick, i'd try to generalize the code so you don't have to bind an event handler to each element
[05:33:08] <blackspotwiggins> and maybe check out templating
[05:33:42] <blackspotwiggins> if you don't want any external dependencies, you are limited with the last part
[05:34:03] <lrvick> yeah i want to avoid any dependencies.
[05:34:27] <lrvick> so your saying having a bind on every element
[05:34:31] <lrvick> actually slows things down?
[05:34:59] <blackspotwiggins> yeah
[05:35:32] <lrvick> but considering i have to build the elements with a $.each loop, since i ahve to do it within a jsonp call
[05:35:35] <lrvick> im not sure of another method
[05:35:41] <lrvick> not saying there isnt, i just cant think of it
[05:35:43] <lrvick> heh
[05:36:05] <blackspotwiggins> well
[05:36:16] <blackspotwiggins> you have a container for all the galleries on front page, right?
[05:36:50] <blackspotwiggins> so instead of binding getalbum to each of them, bind one to the container and use metadata from the current target to determine which gallery to show
[05:37:00] <blackspotwiggins> .data() for example, or data- attributes
[05:37:10] <tokam> Hi I am having problems with the jquery show effect in my user registration
[05:37:12] <lrvick> oh!
[05:37:12] <blackspotwiggins> so when you have 1000 galleries, you are only binding 1 event vs 1000
[05:37:17] <tokam> on IE 8
[05:37:18] <lrvick> blackspotwiggins: so i could still toss all the data into the elemnt
[05:37:21] <lrvick> but just dont make a bind
[05:37:27] <blackspotwiggins> only what you need
[05:37:30] <tokam> if you select "ja" for the 2ed field "Umsatzsteuerpflicht" https://www.seolista.de/user/register
[05:37:35] <blackspotwiggins> i didn't go too deep
[05:37:40] <tokam> on 2 of the 4 fields are shown on IE8
[05:37:43] <tokam> what to change to fix that ?
[05:37:48] <lrvick> well i could attach the album url at least
[05:37:53] <lrvick> which is all i need for the bind anyway
[05:39:31] <blackspotwiggins> kk, going afk now
[05:39:42] <lrvick> blackspotwiggins: thanks for the help :-)
[05:40:52] <N3tw0rK> anyone familar with gmap?
[06:09:18] <Gao> sup fags
[06:09:36] <Eviltwin> Please don't use that kind of language here
[06:09:47] <john> lol
[06:22:53] <stakhanov> Question: When using $.get() to request a page (using ajax), can a specific page element be specified (e.g. a #div tag) to be requested/returned along with custom GET parameters?
[06:23:28] <rroelofs> you want $.load
[06:23:34] <Eviltwin> stakhanov: You get back the HTML at which point you can use $() to turn it into elements and then perform selections on it
[06:23:47] <Eviltwin> If you're goal is to get a specific piece and put it somewhere in the document, you want to see ?.load
[06:23:47] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[06:24:00] <stakhanov> I want to manipulate the requested resource before injecting it into DOM elements. That's why I need .get()
[06:24:36] <stakhanov> .load() just injects the resource right away ...I think.
[06:25:20] <Eviltwin> Correct
[06:25:38] <stakhanov> with .load() I can do .load("page.html #specifictag") to load only the #specifictag from page.html. But what about .get()?
[06:25:51] <Eviltwin> For load you can do that, for .get you cannot
[06:26:12] <stakhanov> So I guess I must head for the low level .ajax() method to find what I am loooking for?
[06:26:27] <stakhanov> Can .ajax() do that?
[06:26:35] <AngryAsian> no.
[06:26:35] <Eviltwin> Not directly
[06:26:53] <AngryAsian> well you can load the entire page and then search for the element with the tag
[06:27:39] <john> can you save the contents from a .get() into a variable or something instead of outputting it right away?
[06:27:56] <stakhanov> So I will store the response in a variable from .get(), and use something like $(response).find(".class") to do that?
[06:27:59] <Eviltwin> Internally, $("#xyz").load("/foo #bar") basically does $.get("/foo", function(data) { $("#xyz").html($("<div>").append(data).find("#bar")) });
[06:28:14] <t4nkd> I'm suspicious of the 'autoFocus' option of my autoselect not working as intended, I'm not seeing any kind of 'highlighted' class on the 'first' result, should I be?
[06:28:19] <Eviltwin> There's a tad more going on than that
[06:28:26] <Eviltwin> But that's the gist of it
[06:28:46] <Eviltwin> john: What are you trying to do?
[06:29:27] <john> Eviltwin: I was just going to suggest saving the data from his .get() into a variable, then parse that data based on a seperate ajax request
[06:29:44] <Eviltwin> Multiple AJAX requests?
[06:29:58] <john> I suppose it would be
[06:30:06] <Eviltwin> .load only uses one
[06:30:08] <john> probably not ideal
[06:30:11] <stakhanov> How can I manipulate the data received (and stored on a variable) using jQuery?
[06:30:25] <stakhanov> ...received from .get()
[06:30:34] <AngryAsian> .find("#foo.bar")
[06:31:38] <anticom> stakhanov you mean .data()??
[06:31:39] <stakhanov> Something like: var data = $.get("page.html"); $(data).find("foo.bar"); Will this work?
[06:31:57] <stakhanov> No! No data(). That's another story!
[06:32:03] <anticom> ah sorry, yea my fault
[06:32:07] <stakhanov> The requested html resource, I mean.
[06:32:17] <anticom> umm... if should be returned as JSON object
[06:32:20] <Eviltwin> stakhanov: http://pastebin.com/hqK936s6
[06:32:54] <AngryAsian> well... $.get("stuff.html",function(data){  $(data).find('#foo.bar'); });
[06:33:30] <stakhanov> Well, the requested page is a Joomla! page, returned from a joomla component, so it needs further customizing for returning json. JSON would be the best.
[06:33:47] <stakhanov> Thanx EvilTwin and AngryAsian, I'll try these for a start.
[06:34:02] <AngryAsian> well you can do $.parseJSON(data) and then do things on it.
[06:34:40] <BassPlaya> I have an element on a page that I want to show again in an overlay that spans across the entire width of the page. How can I do that? Do I have to create a variable and store the html in there, then show it on page load? Any ideas?
[06:35:10] <sphinxxx> BassPlaya, can you make a jsfiddle
[06:35:10] <john> I'm trying to add and remove the 'checked' state on a checkbox on click to no avail.  http://jsfiddle.net/5ZejR/
[06:35:20] <BassPlaya> btw, I'm not really an expert in jQuery but I'm trying
[06:35:30] <Eviltwin> $("#foo").detach().appendTo("#bar") will take the element #foo, detach it from the document, and reattach it as the last child in #bar
[06:35:53] <BassPlaya> sphinxxx: no idea what a jsfiddle is
[06:36:13] <Eviltwin> john: Uh...what?
[06:36:24] <sphinxxx> ?jsfiddle
[06:36:25] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[06:36:41] <john> Eviltwin: well ultimately I want to submit the value of a checkbox only if it's checked
[06:36:49] <john> via ajax
[06:36:51] <Eviltwin> john: You knoe they check and uncheck themselves, right?
[06:37:03] <john> but they don't add the checked attribute
[06:37:09] <john> or can I just use (':checked')
[06:37:24] <Eviltwin> Yeah, you can just use :checked
[06:37:32] <john> oh, derp, thanks
[06:37:55] <BassPlaya> sphinxxx: ok but before I post my bad code here I would like to know what the steps would be, I mean the logic behind what I'm trying to do. It looks similar to http://flowplayer.org/tools/demos/overlay/trigger.htm but then with a div from my page
[06:38:05] <Eviltwin> ?serialize @ john
[06:38:05] <bot-t> john, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[06:38:11] <Eviltwin> You might want to take a look at that
[06:38:42] <john> ok, so for all of the checkboxes that are checked, I could just do a foreach .is(':checked') and serialize them, correct?
[06:39:12] <kborchers> ?ui.dialog @ BassPlaya
[06:39:12] <bot-t> BassPlaya, A dialog is a floating window that contains a title bar and a content area. The dialog window can be moved, resized and closed with the 'x' icon by default. http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[06:40:00] <AngryAsian> well... yeah you can do that. john.
[06:40:06] <sphinxxx> anyone used amplify.js ?
[06:40:09] <nVee> hey guys. I am trying to build a quick edit facility for my admin panel with jquery. In short, I have 3 data cells, the 3rd one has a input button called edit. Should a user click edit, I want td1's content to change into a input field with the existing content as the value, and td2 the same thing just a textarea. I am unsure on how to approach this
[06:40:12] <john> cool
[06:40:13] <nVee> can anyone help?
[06:40:15] <sphinxxx> is it a good choice for use with jquery mobile, for a mobile app
[06:40:29] <john> AngryAsian: are you hinting that there's a more preferred way to do it than that lol
[06:41:00] <AngryAsian> nope.  I just had to think it through :P  I usually just have to serialize the whole form after doing validations.
[06:41:02] <BassPlaya> kborchers: I don't want to make a dialogue box, probably a clone of some div already on the page that now is also displayed in an overlay on my site
[06:41:13] <Eviltwin> nVee: Let's say the content HTML is "<b>Hi</b> there"
[06:41:17] <john> Ah I see
[06:41:21] <Eviltwin> What do you want to be in the input and textarea?
[06:42:04] <BassPlaya> I'm wondering if I need to create a var, then put that div in that var and then display that var with the overlay function
[06:42:18] <kborchers> ?clone @ BassPlaya
[06:42:19] <bot-t> BassPlaya, .clone([withDataAndEvents]): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[06:42:23] <nVee> Eviltwin: I want the Hi to be the value of an input field. So effectively it replaces the existing <b>Hi</b> with a <input name="catName" value="<b>Hi</b>" />
[06:42:27] <nVee> something in that line
[06:42:37] <Eviltwin> BassPlaya: Already answered the question, scroll up
[06:43:13] <nVee> my problem at the moment is the identifying each td
[06:43:53] <kborchers> hey Eviltwin, just FYI. Above you said $("#foo").detach().appendTo("#bar") but you don't need to detach. appendTo will move the element
[06:43:57] <Eviltwin> nVee: Have you used .eq before?
[06:44:10] <nVee> Eviltwin: no i have not?
[06:44:11] <Eviltwin> kborchers: Huh, I thought I had some weird behavior with that in the past
[06:44:18] <Eviltwin> ?.eq @ nVee
[06:44:18] <bot-t> nVee, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[06:45:19] <kborchers> i've never had a problem but that's not to say there may not be some edge cases that could cause issues
[06:45:42] <jac0bz1> Hi! Is to possible to search each "rel" attribute of an Anchor within an unsorted list?
[06:46:00] <jac0bz1> to check if that is simular to a variable i got?
[06:49:25] <Eviltwin> nVee: http://jsfiddle.net/RszDZ/
[06:49:51] <Eviltwin> jac0bz1: Can you rephrase that? I didn't quite understand
[06:50:24] <Eviltwin> nVee: You can obviously change the details
[06:51:08] <Eviltwin> I used classes to identify the tds
[06:51:15] <jac0bz1> Ok.. If i got an unsorted list with alot of anchors.. and i have an variable, say: var foo = "some/string/here"; Now i want to search that unsorted list to see if any of the anchors has that string in theyr REL attribute.. then do some changes to that
[06:51:18] <jac0bz1> anchor
[06:53:30] <Eviltwin> nVee: You can also upgrade it a bit to support multiple of each type in the row: http://jsfiddle.net/RszDZ/1/
[06:53:56] <Eviltwin> jac0bz1: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/attribute-selectors/
[06:54:01] <jac0bz1> Eviltwin: http://jsbin.com/etehaz/edit#javascript,html
[06:55:08] <elux> does anyone know of anymore demo apps built with ember outside of the examples on emberjs.com?
[06:55:24] <Eviltwin> I'd try Googling for it
[06:55:32] <Eviltwin> I don't know of any
[06:55:39] <jac0bz1> Tnx Eviltwin
[06:55:45] <jac0bz1> got it to work now :)
[06:55:55] <t4nkd> Is there an easy way to tweak the position result for an attribute(top, specifically) to subtract 2-3 integers?
[06:56:19] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: CSS position, you mean?
[06:56:39] <t4nkd> yeah, I'm using autocomplete and I'd like for the 'top' to be like, 2-3 pixels /less/
[06:56:51] <t4nkd> And I know it uses jquery-ui position
[06:57:00] <t4nkd> But I don't really understand how to tweak that
[06:57:21] <Eviltwin> I think you can do $("#foo").css("top", $("#foo").css("top") - 3) to decrease by 3 pixels
[06:57:28] <Eviltwin> If it's positioned in pixels
[06:57:44] <Eviltwin> If you're talking about something else, I'm not familiar with it
[06:58:25] <t4nkd> Hrm okay, I guess I just need to figure out how to execute that
[06:58:40] <BinaryMaster> if I use $.extend and obj1 and obj2 have properties that are the same will it over write the content of the property of obj1 with obj2?
[06:58:50] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: If you can jsFiddle your example, I can take a look
[06:59:07] <Eviltwin> BinaryMaster: Yeah, it's right-to-left precidence
[06:59:14] <BinaryMaster> cool
[06:59:18] <BinaryMaster> thank you
[06:59:18] <Eviltwin> The rightmost value for that key wins
[06:59:23] <t4nkd> I think I got it, I'm just gonna write that function you suggested as a callback to autocomplete's... some event
[06:59:28] <Eviltwin> And the first arg actually gets modified
[06:59:46] <Eviltwin> $.extend(a, b, c, d)
[06:59:52] <Eviltwin> "a" will be modified
[07:00:02] <Eviltwin> If you don't want that to happen, do $.extend({}, a, b, c, d)
[07:00:07] <BinaryMaster> obj1 gets modified or the returned obj is?
[07:00:18] <Eviltwin> the object that returned is whatever the first arg is
[07:00:23] <Eviltwin> And that is the one that gets modified
[07:00:28] <Eviltwin> see ?.extend
[07:00:29] <bot-t> jQuery.extend(target, [object1], [objectN]): Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[07:00:43] <Eviltwin> It's all explained there
[07:01:12] <Rndnick> hi
[07:01:33] <Rndnick> how do i avoid other divs dislocating on animation
[07:01:49] <BinaryMaster> its looks like var OBJn = $.extend(obj1, obj2); OBJn would have the values but obj1 and obj2 shouldn't be modified right?
[07:02:38] <zorph>  Rndnick: absolute position them? if they're relative..they will move
[07:02:49] <Rndnick> zorph : will that make them overlap ?
[07:03:46] <zorph> Rndnick: if the animated element moves over the same position...then yes (depending on the z-index)
[07:04:43] <zorph> Rndnick: whichever has the higher z-index will appear over the other...
[07:05:02] <BinaryMaster> Never mind I got it
[07:05:28] <Rndnick> thanks zorphey
[07:07:14] <Eviltwin> BinaryMaster: a = $.extend(b, c);
[07:07:34] <Eviltwin> b will be modified and a and b will refer to the same object
[07:07:44] <Eviltwin> If you don't want that to happen
[07:07:50] <Eviltwin> You need to do a = $.extend({}, b, c)
[07:07:57] <Eviltwin> At which point b and c will be unmodified
[07:07:59] <SnackWhack> hiya
[07:08:06] <Eviltwin> And a will be the collection of rightmost values for each key of both
[07:08:47] <t4nkd> Is it better practice to write the source: option for autocomplete as an ajax function or a getJSON?
[07:09:12] <Eviltwin> $.getJSON will eventually call $.ajax
[07:09:22] <Eviltwin> So it's at least one more function call if you do $.getJSON
[07:09:37] <SnackWhack> Can someone take a look at: http://pastebin.com/xCebSKpw <- Note lines 32 and 33. I would expect line 58 to fire off anytime one of those radio buttons is checked. But it only fires for the first radio button, not both. Any ideas why?
[07:09:39] <Eviltwin> However if the $.getJSON is neater, you might consider that a better practice for readabaility
[07:10:08] <t4nkd> hrm okie, so it's more or less flavor choice with some subtle consideration for what each function is actually doing
[07:10:23] <Eviltwin> SnackWhack: For one thing, two different elements can't have the same ID
[07:10:52] <SnackWhack> Eviltwin: I thought radio buttons had to have the same, but different values
[07:11:03] <Eviltwin> Same name
[07:11:29] <elux> btw guys.. i love emberjs
[07:11:37] <SnackWhack> Eviltwin: can I rewrite it so the same function is used for either radio button?
[07:12:05] <Eviltwin> SnackWhack: Drop the IDs, change the #ug_international to input[name=ug_international]
[07:12:39] <elux> its the perfect weight of a framework to do MVC ..  really an object binding constructs, hooked into templating, with some additional functions to manipulate objects..
[07:14:38] <SnackWhack> Eviltwin: got it, thx
[07:20:02] <craigwhite> http://jsfiddle.net/white_n_az/egHfd/3/  <<---- pretty much functional but because I have many elements to update, I am updating the entire <div> which means that my 'drag & drop' functionality doesn't attach to the now reloaded <div> - can someone help me modify this so the code reattaches to the newly updated <div> ?
[07:22:20] <tktiddle> Is there anyway to tell when an image has fully loaded?
[07:22:39] <sphinxxx> window.load
[07:23:17] <Eviltwin> tktiddle: $("#myimage").load(function(){...})
[07:23:20] <Eviltwin> That function fires when it loads
[07:23:29] <Eviltwin> You might be able to check .readyState to see if it has already loaded
[07:25:47] <Eviltwin> craigwhite: Well I would try to avoid just wiping out your elements each time
[07:25:55] <Eviltwin> But if you can't do it any other way, perhaps something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/egHfd/4/
[07:29:45] <craigwhite> Eviltwin - your mod does pretty much the same thing - once it fires once and updates the div, the draggable functions aren't working and I can't do any more drag & drop and yes, it's probably better not to replace the div completely but there are a number of elements there and the targets are built with variables and it's hard to return the exact target ID's for the update
[07:30:56] <`Korvin> Hey, I'm trying to grab a value from an object
[07:31:00] <Eviltwin> craigwhite: I'm not going to totally restructure your code for you unless you start shelling out $$$
[07:31:06] <`Korvin> But my key is a variable
[07:31:13] <Eviltwin> What I presented was the poorer of the two options in my opinion
[07:31:19] <Eviltwin> Because it was the easiest to demonstrate
[07:31:20] <`Korvin> Var s = 'key'; alert(ob.key);
[07:31:26] <`Korvin> Will that work?
[07:31:29] <`Korvin> Rather
[07:31:31] <`Korvin> Var s = 'key'; alert(ob.s);
[07:31:32] <Eviltwin> `Korvin: object.foo === object["foo"]
[07:31:39] <`Korvin> Oh alright
[07:31:40] <`Korvin> Thanks
[07:32:20] <craigwhite> ;-) fair enough - thanks eviltwin
[07:34:33] <andrew_sayers> I'm trying to report a bug (well I think it's a bug), but Trac rejects it as spam (well I don't think it's spam).  Is there anything I can do to convince Trac I'm real?
[07:34:43] <Eviltwin> What's the bug?
[07:35:15] <andrew_sayers> A script tag like <script class="foo">$('.foo')...</script> can't reference itself when you $(element).append() it.
[07:35:27] <andrew_sayers> http://jsfiddle.net/nvmkf/
[07:36:16] <sbp> hi all. I'm following the advice on blog.jquery.com and making a package.json file in advance of the new packages site being up and running. a couple of questions:
[07:36:31] <Eviltwin> andrew_sayers: That's not a bug
[07:36:36] <sbp> * should (user contributed) plugins using jQuery UI components themselves use a ui- prefix in the name field?
[07:36:41] <andrew_sayers> I realise it needs to pull the script out and execute it, but clean() should add the element to the DocumentFragment as well.
[07:37:04] <Raydiation> is there a way how i can get the GET params?
[07:37:06] <sbp> * what is the purpose of the "files" field? will it allow the packaging site to create a .tar.gz from the files enumerated?
[07:37:09] <Raydiation> or a certain GET param?
[07:37:26] <joshsmith> oh man, worst interview ever
[07:37:37] <Eviltwin> andrew_sayers: I don't really see the usecase for this
[07:37:43] <Eviltwin> andrew_sayers: But you can mention it in #jquery-dev
[07:37:55] <Eviltwin> Raydiation: Which GET params?
[07:38:04] <Raydiation> ?preview=true
[07:38:06] <bot-t> Raydiation, jQuery.extend() - Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[07:38:17] <sbp> I'm also more vaguely wondering what timeframe the plugins.jquery.com site is expected to be completed by, just roughly. no idea whether it's days, weeks, months...
[07:38:21] <andrew_sayers> Eviltwin: Thanks... yeah, I really need a bug report to spell out the details :)
[07:38:34] <Eviltwin> Raydiation: Where are they coming from?
[07:38:37] <Eviltwin> The page URL?
[07:38:40] <Raydiation> Eviltwin: yes
[07:39:01] <Eviltwin> window.location.search
[07:39:19] <snagnever> isn't it href?
[07:39:32] <Eviltwin> andrew_sayers: Just because something doesn't work doesn't mean it's a bug
[07:39:48] <Eviltwin> snagnever: No...
[07:42:27] <sbp> are there any particular #jquery users who work on the plugins site that I should keep an eye out for? except ajpiano of course. are scottgonzalez and rdworth often on irc for example?
[07:42:55] <sbp> ah, rworth in the nick list seems a likely candidate for rdworth... :-)
[07:43:22] <rworth> yup, I'm rworth on irc
[07:43:28] <sbp> hey there rworth
[07:43:58] <rworth> sbp: hey - scott is scott_gonzalez
[07:44:21] <sbp> oh, thanks; don't know how I missed that
[07:44:27] <scott_gonzalez> :-)
[07:44:33] <sbp> do either of you have time for the couple of quick package.json questions above?
[07:44:42] <scott_gonzalez> yup
[07:44:46] <sbp> very much looking forward to the new packages site
[07:45:23] <rworth> to answer your first question, no users should not use the ui- prefix
[07:45:38] <rworth> that's for plugins in the jQuery UI suite maintained by the jQuery UI team
[07:45:51] <scott_gonzalez> rworth: that reminds me, we should implement permissions for naming
[07:46:01] <scott_gonzalez> to prevent users from using the ui- prefix
[07:46:03] <Eviltwin> http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide22
[07:46:08] <rworth> good idea
[07:46:30] <sbp> will there be any other reserved prefix- components?
[07:46:40] <Eviltwin> I've reserved eviltwin-
[07:46:44] <sbp> :-)
[07:46:48] <scott_gonzalez> maybe mobile- ?
[07:47:06] <scott_gonzalez> I don't think we'll have anything else
[07:47:35] <rworth> sbp: the files field isn't currently used by the plugins site, my argument to keep it is that it could be used to identify the files needed to deploy the plugin, where the repo may contain many more files than that
[07:48:01] <rworth> scott_gonzalez contends that as long as we're not using it we're not validating it, so the data might not be useful because there's no guarantee of accuracy
[07:48:07] <sbp> yeah, I've been thinking about my repo organisation
[07:48:09] <rworth> so he's pushing to remove it
[07:48:17] <scott_gonzalez> indeed I am :-)
[07:48:21] <john> scott_gonzales: you don't live in Texas, do you
[07:48:32] <john> scott_gonzalez*
[07:48:33] <scott_gonzalez> john: nope
[07:48:38] <john> ok, nevermind
[07:49:00] <sbp> because usually for simple plugins you just want to push a choice of the source file and the minified version to the user so they can choose between them, nothing more than that. for stuff like UI plugins, like the one I'm working on, there might be some style and images and so on, but even those don't tend to be heavy
[07:49:06] <scott_gonzalez> timeframe is probably on the order of 1 month
[07:49:08] <rworth> sbp: as to timeframe, I'd measure it in weeks
[07:49:13] <BinaryMaster> is there a way to test if a element has an attribute I am trying ($(this).attr('attribute').length > 0 ? set value : else set this value); but I get an error Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined
[07:49:18] <sbp> hehe. well four weeks is a month, so okay
[07:49:22] <rworth> :)
[07:49:29] <Eviltwin> BinaryMaster: :P
[07:49:34] <Eviltwin> Seems like you need to learn JavaScript
[07:49:37] <sbp> anything random hackers can do to help?
[07:49:38] <anli__> Can I put some dimmed text in empty textboxes?
[07:49:47] <anli__> To hint what ppl are supposed to put in there
[07:49:52] <rworth> sbp: there are some open issues in the queue
[07:50:11] <Eviltwin> BinaryMaster: For most things you can probably use a simple truthy test
[07:50:13] <rworth> also, we sometimes run into areas where someone with more sysadmin/network service expertise can be helpful
[07:50:14] <john> anli_ use the 'placeholder' attribute
[07:50:24] <Eviltwin> if($(this).attr('attribute')) { ... } else { ... }
[07:50:39] <sbp> hmm, no sysadmin/network expertise here I'm afraid. I'll look through the queue
[07:50:47] <anli__> john: Thanks!
[07:50:52] <rworth> this happened yesterday, as an example https://twitter.com/#!/rworth/status/154976580056260608
[07:50:53] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from rworth: RE jQuery plugins site and sysadmin help, please see https://t.co/eZL9XwV0 ★ http://bit.ly/x4D3w1
[07:50:53] <john> anli__ <input type="text" placeholder="Search…" />
[07:50:56] <sbp> is there any package.json validator or anything like that yet?
[07:50:59] <BinaryMaster> so if the attribute isn't there it returns NULL ?
[07:51:01] <anli__> john: yeah, got that
[07:51:22] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: I have these ASP ajax panels that lose their styling on refresh because jquery is used on page load to add some classes and what not.  Is there something I can do to get them to run every time the asp update panel runs?
[07:51:23] <scott_gonzalez> sbp: not standalone, yet
[07:51:37] <rworth> we want to have one on the site
[07:51:47] <scott_gonzalez> There's a method to validate a package.json in the repo, but we'd like to have one that can be used as a pre-commit hook
[07:51:57] <sbp> you might want to link to http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical under the licenses field so that people know the list of shortnames to use. I assume that's the list you're going to validate with?
[07:52:11] <sbp> (can file that as an issue on github if you want, or add it as a comment on issue 2)
[07:52:13] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: Put the code in a function, call it on ready and again in your AJAX success?
[07:52:28] <sbp> pre-commit hook validation: cool
[07:52:47] <scott_gonzalez> sbp: yes, please file an issue for that
[07:52:50] <jeffsmykil> Eviltwin: there is no ajax success
[07:53:07] <jeffsmykil> asp updates are wonky
[07:53:23] <sbp> will do
[07:53:38] <gyzmodo> hello guys
[07:53:46] <gyzmodo> http://www.joptima.com/demos/01_jqehp/index.html
[07:54:14] <jomofcw> I have a set of element. I want to keep only the five first element, and remove each other. Should I use a each() or is there any other way ?
[07:54:15] <sbp> one small pedantic question: "You may not supply a comparator with a version containing an x." - does that mean that, for example, you can't supply a comparator with a bare number? because "1" maps to "1.x.x", so does that mean that ">=1" is disallowed because that maps to ">=1.x.x" which comes under the quoted prohibition?
[07:54:27] <gyzmodo> how can i redraw green box's height when browser windows resized?
[07:55:42] <scott_gonzalez> sbp: sounds like it, we're not actually validating against that yet, want to file a ticket to validate against dependency versions?
[07:55:53] <elux> hey guys..
[07:56:01] <gyzmodo> any ideas?
[07:56:03] <elux> how does the jquery fadeIn() function work at a lower level with the done..?
[07:56:03] <dogan> hello, I have bind an event on submit form on a login page. I want to make an ajax request first before form submission. Problem is that ajax post dont work as from submits very early.... if on event add on end return false ajax works but this way form dont submits, how delay a bit execution so ajax end and after continue form submission?
[07:56:19] <sbp> also (questions come in a flurry!), are you planning to have an API to the site so that people can automatically install things from the command line? that's what I was thinking that the "files" field might be for... jqnpm install example would just download the files out of that field into the current directory or something
[07:56:35] <sbp> and yep, I'll file a ticket for the dep versions too
[07:56:56] <scott_gonzalez> sbp: yeah, there's an issue about the API/command line tool
[07:57:02] <sbp> oh sorry, missed that
[07:57:03] <scott_gonzalez> we plan on building an API on top of the site
[07:57:12] <sbp> that'd be #9?
[07:57:22] <sbp> ah yes, #9
[07:57:45] <scott_gonzalez> https://github.com/jquery/plugins.jquery.com/issues/3
[07:57:45] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #3 on plugins.jquery.com, reported by micmath (4w, 1h ago): Integration with (AMD) Package Manager
[07:57:45] <sbp> hmm... no, #9 seems to be about installing the actual site
[07:58:02] <scott_gonzalez> yeah, it's kind of buried in #3
[07:58:07] <sbp> ah, thanks. I didn't know what AMD was
[07:58:11] * sbp looks that up
[07:58:22] <scott_gonzalez> but if you scroll down, you'll see the conversation about building an API
[07:58:53] <scott_gonzalez> on a call now
[07:59:03] <sbp> k. thanks very much for the help!
[07:59:16] <sbp> I've a few tabs to read through now, then issues to file... :-)
[08:07:24] <craigwhite> OK - If I am building an array of 'drop' targets and I use    $(this).attr("id")    to identify what I am 'post' to my web server, when I use it like   function(data) { var html = $(data);   $(this).attr("id").empty().append(html.closest($(this).attr "id")).children());  }    it doesn't update the view but this method works if I know the actual 'id' of the drop target with my other 'drag & drop' methods
[08:08:05] <BassPlaya> hmm.. clone() doesn't seem to work for me..
[08:08:27] <jeffsmykil> how does one to a pageLoad function
[08:09:36] <BassPlaya> my bad.. it does clone..
[08:11:12] <cybersholt> jeffsmykil check this link http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&ved=0CDEQFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mkyong.com%2Fjavascript%2Fjavascript-call-funtion-after-page-load%2F&ei=_RwHT7CPGsmRsAK5hJGRCg&usg=AFQjCNFMDs0lhcyMb-dXa7RJ3JsZXE5zHA

[08:11:54] <jeffsmykil> i found my answer here
[08:12:01] <jeffsmykil> http://encosia.com/simplify-aspnet-ajax-client-side-page-initialization/
[08:12:28] <JAAulde> Does the jQ UI combobox code at http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#combobox exist in any official format, or should I extract it from the demo source?
[08:12:44] <cybersholt> the jquery document ready function is probly better since your here
[08:13:30] <cybersholt> JAAulde just download the jq ui source and call the function you need
[08:13:48] <cybersholt> the demo source should help you get started
[08:13:50] <jeffsmykil> i think he means the html
[08:14:33] <JAAulde> cybersholt: combobox is not an official UI widget. It's created on top of autosuggest in that demo.  I am asking if the source for that widget exists "officially
[08:14:46] <JAAulde> " anywhere or if I should just extract it
[08:15:14] <kborchers> JAAulde: you'll have to pull it from the demo
[08:15:51] <JAAulde> kborchers: cool.  I have done so for testing and prototyping, but before I added it to my system officially, I thought I'd check if there were a more official or supported version
[08:15:55] <JAAulde> thanks all

[08:20:43] <cybersholt> its an interesting port anywayz
[08:20:50] <Rndnick> my div z-index isnt working well
[08:21:41] <MagePsycho> can anyone recommend best ajax pagination for jQuery
[08:22:34] <cybersholt> Mage this one worked well for me http://archive.plugins.jquery.com/project/pagination
[08:23:01] <jasonleds> Free PSN Store Codes   http://www.points2shop.com/?ref=uin1328881016
[08:26:33] <Rndnick> my div z-index isnt working well
[08:26:42] <MagePsycho> twitter like continous scroller
[08:27:27] <jeffsmykil> ok this silverliht quake thing doesnt even work
[08:28:50] <MagePsycho> which one is good for continuous scrolling plugin?
[08:30:02] <jeffsmykil> MagePsycho: : doesnt twitter have a github page
[08:30:08] <jeffsmykil> where they let you have that stuff
[08:30:41] <shwaiil> hi ppl
[08:31:02] <cybersholt> i dont know how u would use pagination with something live scrolling like that
[08:31:25] <shwaiil> Q: I'm stuck while trying to use a obj syntax. I'm trying to access the object tough "this" without success. I'm wondering whats wrong ? http://jsfiddle.net/hnURb/ tks for looking
[08:31:45] <MagePsycho> https://github.com/twitter
[08:31:53] <MagePsycho> yes but there is that conitnous crolliing
[08:32:47] <Pilate> shwaiil: an object isnt a different context, 'this' still refers to window
[08:33:12] <shwaiil> Pilate: ahhhh tks for looking
[08:33:15] <jeffsmykil> im so using bootstrap for the next site i do
[08:33:18] <cybersholt> you would need to like grab x posts when they go by and out them in an container and call pagination
[08:33:22] <Pilate> bootstrap is beautiful x.x
[08:33:56] <jeffsmykil> plate I wish I used it for the last project I did
[08:34:19] <jeffsmykil> iu would have been done two weeks ago
[08:35:24] <zorph> Rndnick: what's not workin?
[08:36:22] <zorph> Rndnick: whichever element you want on top...set a higher z-index in the css
[08:36:51] <shwaiil> Pilate: i'm doing console.log() for this, and it says is the object and not the window, so thats not the problem ?! could u give a tip ? http://jsfiddle.net/hnURb/1/
[08:37:01] <dizzyone> hello, I have a question, probably a stupid one. When I use a show animation on an a tag, like show() etc or fadeIn(), it gives it the display:inline style. This causes problems with Jquery Mobile, it needs to be a display:block. Right now I'm simply giving it a callback, but I was wondering if there is a better way to fix this
[08:39:01] <cybersholt> dizzyone: do you have it up on a site like jsfiddle.net?
[08:39:40] <ngharo> shwaiil: function changes `this` context
[08:40:19] <ngharo> shwaiil: http://jsfiddle.net/hnURb/3/
[08:40:47] <jeffsmykil> Pilate: how does one specify the content of a popup with bootstrap?
[08:40:49] <shwaiil> ngharo: thanks
[08:41:16] <Eviltwin> If anyone wants to see their browser have a heart attack, http://jsfiddle.net/ULdXK/
[08:41:29] <AngryAsian> also shwaiil: http://jsfiddle.net/hnURb/4/ would clear your "this" doubt
[08:41:40] <AngryAsian> maybe... hopefully. :o
[08:41:41] <shwaiil> AngryAsian: thanks :)
[08:41:43] <dizzyone> cybersholt, not on jsfiddle, it's a pretty messy website though: http://raegquit.com/IAM/sensior/ (click "inloggen", then click on any link on the left, a button will show up, top left of the house image
[08:41:50] <jeffsmykil> interesting you have to put it in the data-content tag
[08:41:53] <dizzyone> it'll be transparant, instead of opaque
[08:42:09] <jeffsmykil> i wonder how you could use that with ajax
[08:42:17] <shwaiil> AngryAsian: ahhh :P
[08:42:36] <dizzyone> I'm pretty sure it's because it's display:inline, after using: .fadeIn('slow',function(){ $(this).show(); });
[08:42:46] <dizzyone> it works if I change the callback
[08:42:47] <shwaiil> so to refear to handlers, what should I do  ?!
[08:43:06] <dizzyone> but I'm trying to fix it so it doesn't do the display:inline, at all
[08:44:22] <cybersholt> just adjust the css of it after your call
[08:44:37] <dizzyone> yeh ):
[08:44:51] <cybersholt> very cool site tho
[08:45:02] <dizzyone> doing that in the callback now.
[08:45:57] <gamegenius86> is there a way to append an element not the middle of a list?  Basically, i have a list of say 10 divs, and i want to add one after the 3rd.  Is there an easy way to append it to that location without rebuilding the list?
[08:47:39] <cybersholt> dizzy after looking at the code it looks like ya got it right
[08:49:57] <failjs> yo, i need to catch the scroll event, in a NO scrollbars windows :( what do? if there are not scrollbars the event never fires. Adding content & overflow:hidden gives same effect.
[08:50:36] <sandropadin> Hi. Is there a way to pause or stop a jqXHR in an $.ajaxPrefilter callback?
[08:52:07] <Eviltwin> failjs: If there's no scrolling, there's no scroll event
[08:54:11] <Andreas2k4> gamegenius86: $(container).find("div").eq(3).before(element_to_append)
[08:54:45] <gamegenius86> thx
[08:55:33] <sphinxxx> gamegenius86, if you odn't know how many divs are in it, you can count, and then append to the middle one using .eq
[08:56:23] <failjs> Eviltwin: scrollable seems to work somehow, gonna see what they are doing
[08:56:24] <dizzyone> cybersholt
[08:56:36] <dizzyone> now that I've put in the callback to make it display:block
[08:56:37] <cybersholt> whats up dizzy
[08:56:39] <dizzyone> as before
[08:56:40] <dizzyone> http://raegquit.com/IAM/sensior/
[08:56:44] <dizzyone> it's the animation that is ugly
[08:56:53] <dizzyone> should I just customize jquery's hide and show function?
[08:56:55] <cybersholt> 1 sec
[08:57:09] <jomofcw> exit
[08:57:09] <dizzyone> $('a#homeButton').show('slow', function(){ $(this).css('display','block') });
[08:58:05] <cybersholt> eh god yea it is it looks like the way the ui elements are assembled
[08:58:39] <dizzyone> the weird thing is
[08:58:50] <dizzyone> if you refresh the page with #mainPage included in the link
[08:58:56] <dizzyone> the show() animation of jquery
[08:59:01] <dizzyone> uses display:inline-block
[08:59:09] <dizzyone> during the show animation
[08:59:23] <dizzyone> but if you run the site from the main page (the one with the login)
[08:59:28] <dizzyone> and enter #mainPage
[08:59:32] <dizzyone> it uses display:inline
[08:59:37] <dizzyone> which completely screws up the animation
[08:59:41] <dizzyone> odd behaviour
[08:59:55] <cybersholt> very odd
[09:00:25] <cybersholt> i guess you need to stick with inline for that , seems like the best result
[09:01:07] <cybersholt> i see artifacts with block display
[09:01:22] <cybersholt> + makes the animation jerky
[09:01:57] <cybersholt> seems to be ok after you make a selection and it's hiding the element tho
[09:03:30] <failjs> ok, you can bind to wheel events, also via mousewheel plugin.
[09:04:14] <cybersholt> be back in a few
[09:05:20] <lrvick> So apparently $.on() only works for elements currently present in the page
[09:05:28] <Eviltwin> ...
[09:05:30] <lrvick> whats the way to bind to a parent, and apply a bind to all children
[09:05:34] <lrvick> present and future
[09:05:47] <Rndnick> hi
[09:05:56] <Rndnick> the divs of my page are more then 100%
[09:06:01] <Rndnick> how can i avoid this ?
[09:06:10] <Eviltwin> $("[static]").on("event", "[dynamic]", function() { ... })
[09:06:30] <Eviltwin> Where "[static] [dynamic]" is the whole selector
[09:06:47] <Eviltwin> "[static]" being something that exists currently in the page
[09:07:08] <Eviltwin> "[dynamic]" being the part may or may not exist currently in the page
[09:08:44] <lrvick> dynamic being only the child like li
[09:08:46] <lrvick> ?
[09:08:54] <lrvick> or the whole selector again, for anything future
[09:09:37] <Eviltwin> dynamic being what you'd tack on to the static selector to match the element
[09:09:40] <Eviltwin> So like "li"
[09:10:04] <Eviltwin> $("#foo ul").bind("click", "li a", function() { ... })
[09:10:10] <lrvick> ah ok
[09:10:17] <Eviltwin> Where the whole selector is kind of like #foo ul li a
[09:10:17] <lrvick> and that will match now and future
[09:10:21] <lrvick> like live()
[09:10:33] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live
[09:10:38] <lrvick> right i dont plan to
[09:10:42] <Eviltwin> .delegate is the replacement to .live
[09:10:44] <lrvick> i wanted to learn to use on properly to replace my live use
[09:10:55] <Eviltwin> And .on is new way of doing .bind, .live, or .delegate
[09:11:03] <Eviltwin> .live is deprecated
[09:11:07] <lrvick> thats what i read, i jsut could not quite follow
[09:11:09] <Eviltwin> .on and .delegate are not
[09:11:10] <lrvick> your explanation heloped a lot
[09:11:27] <Eviltwin> It's why I've been slowly writing an article about it that I'll be able to just link people to
[09:11:38] <lrvick> You should :-)
[09:11:47] <shwaiil> Q: For <ul></ul> if i want to add a IL in first and another in last, what's the best way to do that ? Select UL LI:first and prepend and UL LI:last appendTo ? Tks
[09:11:59] <lrvick> having one event handeler to rule them all
[09:12:00] <lrvick> makes tons of sens
[09:12:09] <Eviltwin> Really the only thing keeping me from finishing it is showmanship
[09:12:34] <Eviltwin> I want to show people places where .live doesn't work
[09:12:43] <lrvick> aww
[09:12:44] <dizzyone> hey cybersholt, thanks for the help
[09:12:48] <lrvick> its not delegating a second  time
[09:12:50] <Eviltwin> Without telling them how it works until after
[09:12:50] <lrvick> in my code
[09:12:52] <lrvick> thats sad
[09:12:54] <lrvick> le tme make a testcase
[09:12:58] <Eviltwin> jsFiddle
[09:13:06] <cybersholt> dizzyone: no problem bro keep up the great work
[09:13:09] <dizzyone> I found out the problem, I was hiding (initial) the button before the button was loaded
[09:13:36] <cybersholt> i just refreshed and noticed it was running smooth with block
[09:13:42] <dizzyone> $( '#mainPage' ).live( 'pageinit',function(event){
[09:13:42] <dizzyone> 			$('a#homeButton').hide();
[09:13:42] <dizzyone> 		});
[09:13:53] <cybersholt> ahhh i see
[09:14:01] <dizzyone> :)
[09:14:10] <Eviltwin> dizzyone: Don't use .live
[09:14:17] <Eviltwin> I literally just explained this
[09:14:27] <dizzyone> oh, I just read it on jquery mobile's documentation
[09:14:31] <lrvick> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/L679L/40/ if you click gallery, then click an album, then click gallery again, tehn click an album
[09:14:34] <dizzyone> let me read up
[09:14:34] <lrvick> it does not work on the second pass
[09:14:50] <lrvick> all of that is being bound by .On in the function getGallery() and only runs once
[09:14:50] <Eviltwin> ?jdb @ lrvick
[09:14:50] <bot-t> lrvick, We're not here to help you dig through hundreds of lines of code. We're here to help you figure out why about a dozen lines don't produce the expected result. Make it convenient for us to help you by using jsfiddle.net to build a working demo of your problem.
[09:15:14] <lrvick> Lol ok ill make an even smaller testcase
[09:15:16] <dizzyone> Eviltwin, the jquery mobile documentation is outdated
[09:15:24] <dizzyone> it's still saying I should use live
[09:15:25] <Eviltwin> dizzyone: So update it
[09:15:32] <dizzyone> I don't know how .on works though
[09:15:36] <dizzyone> I just heard it from you :)
[09:15:50] <dizzyone> I think I read about it briefly on jQuery's docs, but haven't used it
[09:16:04] <jedimind> dont be afraid to try new things
[09:16:09] <jedimind> there's a new years resolution for ya
[09:18:26] <Eviltwin> lrvick: http://jsfiddle.net/L679L/41/
[09:18:31] <Eviltwin> Your problem isn't the .on
[09:18:35] <Eviltwin> It's your logic somewhere else
[09:19:51] <nFFF> Guys Im baffled
[09:19:51] <nFFF> http://www.safeguardarmour.co.uk/staging/index.php/store/bullet-proof-vests.html
[09:19:57] <nFFF> items per page
[09:20:04] <lrvick> hmm
[09:20:05] <nFFF> Im using jscript to change the look of the select
[09:20:15] <nFFF> And its got them as orange drop down?
[09:20:18] <nFFF> I dont get it
[09:21:28] <Eviltwin> lrvick: The problem is the $('.picasaGallery').empty()
[09:22:10] <lrvick> why does that break the on?
[09:22:54] <Eviltwin> It doesn't
[09:23:10] <Eviltwin> It breaks the data you've put on those elements
[09:23:18] <lrvick> oh!
[09:23:20] <Eviltwin> It calls a .remove() on each of the children
[09:23:23] <Eviltwin> Which removes the data from them as well
[09:23:25] <lrvick> so should i go with .detatch() then?
[09:23:55] <Eviltwin> Yes
[09:23:58] <Eviltwin> Something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/L679L/41/
[09:25:22] <lrvick> Eviltwin: woo! all works. Thanks :-) http://new.lrvick.net/js/jquery-picasagallery/demo.html#
[09:25:29] <lrvick> i learned a couple new things
[09:34:55] <meesebyte> Any idea why both divs animate when one is hovered over? http://jsfiddle.net/meesebyte/Y9rbK/266/
[09:35:17] <meesebyte> something is probably connected that shouldn't be I'm guessing
[09:35:32] <Rndnick> hmz
[09:35:46] <Rndnick> why is $(document).width larger then the actual browser window ?
[09:35:53] <Rndnick> how do i get the browser width ?
[09:36:08] <meesebyte> oh woops
[09:36:09] <meesebyte> eh
[09:36:29] <meesebyte> in action: http://meesebyte.com/index-test.html
[09:37:12] <Rndnick> meesebyte : do you know if its possible to change contrast of div contents ?
[09:37:48] <meesebyte> I don't know
[09:37:55] <meesebyte> why?
[09:38:06] <Rndnick> why is $(document).width larger then the actual browser window ?
[09:38:07] <Rndnick> how do i get the browser width ?
[09:38:50] <meesebyte> rndnick: are you asking about my jsfiddle?

[09:45:19] <jimmyrcom> muah, jquerybot works
[09:46:16] <Eviltwin> Shouldn't that be $(selector, context)

[09:47:04] <jimmyrcom> I didn't want to use quotes eviltwin
[09:47:25] <jimmyrcom> selectors can have comma, and it splits by comma
[09:48:03] <meesebyte> Eviltwin: I can't figure out why both divs animate when I hover over one or the other, when they should act independently: http://jsfiddle.net/meesebyte/Y9rbK/268/
[09:48:36] <nFFF> Any jQuery to get the first word in a string?
[09:48:37] <fgro> does jquery support dynamic selectors (i.e. using regexp?). need to seperately toggle items on my orders summary
[09:48:50] <nFFF> Need to add <span> tags around first word

[09:55:19] <jgspratt> I would like to make it so that when you press ctrl+e on a page, your url is modified by removing a certain number of characters from the front and adding a new, constant string.  how can I do that?
[09:57:19] <sphinxxx> in a $.ajax call, can you put custom headers ?
[09:58:11] <DanGer> sphinxxx: you can do that in ajax setup IIRC
[09:59:44] <sphinxxx> nevermind, just found its not possible when using jsonp
[10:00:38] <DanGer> sphinxxx: check this: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-ajax-beforesend-accept-encoding-behavior
[10:01:13] <DanGer> i.e. set beforeSend to the callback setting your custom headers.
[10:01:50] <sphinxxx> yea DanGer thanks, unforuntately you can't if you're sending jsonp
[10:02:00] <sphinxxx> but otherwise that would work
[10:07:07] <BFranks> How hard would it be to put the % done or even something like "12 of 130 records completed"  in the middle of the progress bar UI? http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Progressbar
[10:09:05] <diamonds> hey
[10:09:07] <diamonds> http://www.pastie.org/3138662
[10:09:31] <diamonds> how can I access the $appModal (the link that triggers the overlay) from inside those callbacks?
[10:10:33] <diamonds> must I $appModal.each(function(){$that = $(this); $that.overlay('callback'=>function(){ $that.whatever... ?
[10:10:51] <diamonds> I'm trying to get a data element or something from the orig. link
[10:12:25] <BFranks> I dunno but I'd say that the whole idea of asking via paste was mitigated by using 5 lines to ask the question
[10:13:09] <BFranks> (Not that succinct requests are getting any more love/attention)
[10:14:13] <roowilliams> can anyone see why the first image on the slideshow here starts on the right? I would like it in the center like the rest of them! http://www.sirizanelli.com/project/room101/
[10:14:39] <ajpiano> BFranks: it would not be hard
[10:15:10] <roowilliams> http://www.sirizanelli.com/wp-content/themes/studiosiri/js/jquery.cycle.all.js?ver=1.0 this is my script.. i have modded it slightly from the original cycle script
[10:15:22] <diamonds> BFranks: thanks.... ?
[10:15:46] <diamonds> If you are running out of lines just ask
[10:15:51] <diamonds> you can scp some from me :)
[10:15:56] <ajpiano> diamonds: just refer to it.  $appModal
[10:16:06] <diamonds> ajpiano: but it's a group
[10:16:13] <ajpiano> ah
[10:16:17] <diamonds> the overlay method is interating
[10:16:28] <ajpiano> then use each yourself explicitly
[10:16:38] <diamonds> like I wrote above sort of?
[10:16:49] <BFranks> diamonds: NP .. I love to point out the problems in the AM and then in the PM I'm a cup is half-full type..
[10:16:53] <ajpiano> well, first check if the plugin gives you access to the element as 'this' or passes it in as an argument
[10:17:11] <ajpiano> diamonds: if not, then yes, do what you described above
[10:17:34] <Rndnick> how to i get the trigger for when .animate goes in reverse ??
[10:17:57] <diamonds> ajpiano: it doesn't seem to... I console.logged this inside a callback and it had the callbacks but didn't seem to have the calling element itself
[10:18:08] <BFranks> ajpiano: I guess I should say "is there an easy method I'm not seeing in the docs, or a clean quick trick I could use without trying to whip up some javascript to position some text in the center of the div?"
[10:18:11] <ajpiano> is it passed in as an argument
[10:18:20] <ajpiano> BFranks: there is a forthcoming example from me :p
[10:18:45] <BFranks> ajpiano: well then there's a forthcoming TYVM coming from me ;p
[10:18:50] <fgro> if i have a strign "test_12321" what is the simplest way to extract the digits? (string is always same pattern, {word_digits}
[10:18:58] <diamonds> ajpiano: ah... good question!!
[10:19:02] <Rndnick> how to i get the trigger for when .animate goes in reverse ??
[10:19:31] <SirCmpwn> $("a").click()
[10:19:40] <SirCmpwn> how to override the browser from navigating to the href?
[10:20:04] <diamonds> SirCmpwn: preventDefualt, return false
[10:20:24] <Rndnick> how to i get the trigger for when .animate goes in reverse ??
[10:20:26] <SirCmpwn> thanks
[10:20:32] <BFranks> fgro: I'm a rookie but I'd say var temparray = string.split("_"); and then "temparray[1]" should have the #s
[10:21:16] <BFranks> frgo: one sec I'll make an example ?
[10:24:34] <BFranks> frgo: Yeah my kludge worked: http://pastebin.com/vpkKunpp
[10:26:23] <fgro> BFranks: thanks
[10:26:48] <BFranks> frgo: Not a problem.. great that my skill level can help here while I ask questions.. ;)
[10:27:45] <ajpiano> BFranks: this probable isn't exactly what you're after but it should push you in the right direction http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/VsVqs/1/
[10:29:32] <BFranks> ajpiano: Looks great! I should be able to tweak it for the x of y complete no problem.. thanks!
[10:29:40] <ajpiano> sweet, figured as much! no prb
[10:29:52] <BFranks> Heck that's a WAY better demo than the jqueryui page.. ;p
[10:31:02] <ajpiano> heh i don't think we like to show people how to dig into the pseudo-private aspects of the widget to screw with their elements in the official demos
[10:31:24] <ajpiano> but "getting the actual widget instance" is supremely useful on the regular for bending jqueryui to your will often
[10:36:14] <BFranks> Well I meant more along the lines of your demo breaks out the components clearly (CSS/HTML/JS) plus you took the time to add the delay to show the animate function work which helps too.. :)
[10:38:39] <b0ot> Any suggestions for books someone with C++ programming experience on learning PHP/Jquery/css/mysql ?
[10:40:24] <Eviltwin> b0ot: Before you learn jQuery, learn JavaScript
[10:40:27] <Eviltwin> For resources on that see ?learn
[10:40:27] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[10:40:38] <ajpiano> BFranks: well thats jsfidle for ya :)
[10:40:47] <ajpiano> but yea, the interval definitely helps with the illustartion that it works :p
[10:41:31] <ravenzz> b0ot you could start from wsc.opera.com then with JS eloquentjavascript.net plus the ones Eviltwin gave to you
[10:41:46] <Eviltwin> ravenzz: Eloquent is on that list, I believe
[10:42:14] <ravenzz> about php dunno it shouldn't  be that hard for a C++ developer
[10:42:15] <ajpiano> nope, it should be though, it's in see ?101
[10:42:16] <bot-t> nope, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[10:42:19] <ravenzz> ask on php
[10:42:27] <b0ot> I'm looking for some books to read for my upcomming trip
[10:42:30] <ravenzz> #php
[10:42:37] <b0ot> lots of down travel time without net access
[10:42:48] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: Second thing under intermediate?
[10:42:51] <ajpiano> bot-t: learn is First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript | http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[10:42:51] <bot-t> ajpiano, Changed "learn".

[10:43:15] <Eviltwin> Yes
[10:43:20] <Eviltwin> That's why it was the way it was

[10:57:13] <Eviltwin> DofLeFou: I'm using Safari right now and it's returning "foo bar"
[11:01:32] <DofLeFou> not from my browser … i meant within my app
[11:01:55] <DofLeFou> it is on JQuery Dialog
[11:02:06] <Eviltwin> What?
[11:02:19] <Eviltwin> Open this link: http://jsfiddle.net/RgSTJ/
[11:02:24] <Eviltwin> Tell me what is alerted
[11:02:46] <DofLeFou> <input id="NewAssetURL" type="text" value=""> …. is inside a JQuery Dialog
[11:03:06] <Eviltwin> Open this link: http://jsfiddle.net/RgSTJ/
[11:03:07] <Eviltwin> Tell me what is alerted
[11:03:13] <DofLeFou> the example you pasted on jsFiddle i can the item just fine
[11:03:29] <Eviltwin> Then the disabled property isn't the problem
[11:03:39] <t4nkd> Eviltwin: is this helping to explain my question at all? https://gist.github.com/1571934
[11:04:02] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: I didn't understand what you meant by the question
[11:04:05] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by the question?
[11:04:50] <t4nkd> I added some functions to jq-ui autocomplete plugin, and I want to use one of those functions in a .submit() function
[11:05:29] <Eviltwin> Is there a reason you added them with underscores in front?
[11:05:43] <nsanden> Anyone clue me in to why this isn't working please? http://jsfiddle.net/Kxyzu/10/
[11:06:00] <t4nkd> No, I found this from someone trying to cross some features of the tagging fields into autocomplete, I think he did it to avoid collisions
[11:07:00] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: If you have the time, I strongly recommend you follow this through: http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[11:07:00] <t4nkd> ...tagging fields probably seems nonsensical there, but, suffice to say, it's just binding some functions to blur and focus to provide 'hints'
[11:07:09] <Eviltwin> As you are extending a jQuery UI Widget
[11:08:34] <t4nkd> Okie, well I appreciate the opportunity to learn more, I just wanted to avoid writing the 'showHint' function again if I didn't have to
[11:08:58] <Eviltwin> t4nkd: In the slides is explained how you call such a function
[11:09:48] <Eviltwin> On slide 10
[11:09:59] <t4nkd> finding that now :D
[11:10:10] <Eviltwin> But I still think it's valuable to read through those slides
[11:11:39] <y3di> how can i bind a click function to elements that will get dynamically generated?
[11:11:48] <gamegenius86> is there a way to find the next element that has a specific class?  so i have a ul, where inside i have a series of li elements that randomly have a class "quest".  now if $(this) is already one li that has the quest class, i want to select the next one with "quest"
[11:12:05] <Pilate> y3di: delegate, or .live if youre lazy
[11:12:10] <kggle_> .next()
[11:12:24] <gamegenius86> well next only gets the next immediate element
[11:12:25] <Eviltwin> Pilate, y3di: Don't use .live
[11:12:48] <Eviltwin> y3di: Use .delegate or if you're using 1.7+, use can also use .on to save chars
[11:13:03] <y3di> no i've been using on() but it for some reason it isn't working for newly generated elements
[11:13:15] <Eviltwin> y3di: You have to use the right syntax for .on
[11:13:18] <Eviltwin> ?see .on
[11:13:19] <Eviltwin> Err
[11:13:21] <bot-t1> Eviltwin, Printable version - Documentation - jQuery - http://docs.jquery.com/action/render/Plugins/Treeview
[11:13:22] <Eviltwin> see ?.on
[11:13:22] <bot-t1> Eviltwin, .on() - Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:13:36] <Eviltwin> ".on( events [, selector] [, data], handler(eventObject) )"
[11:13:41] <Eviltwin> It's that second selector that you need
[11:14:07] <nsanden> Can anyone clue me in to why this isn't working please? http://jsfiddle.net/Kxyzu/10/
[11:14:23] <Eviltwin> nsanden: Escaping
[11:14:48] <nsanden> escape the [ ] ?
[11:14:54] <Eviltwin> Yup
[11:17:00] <nsanden> \ should escape them right

[11:18:08] <b0ot> Eviltwin, You really have no books you could recommend
[11:18:14] <Eviltwin> b0ot: For?
[11:18:20] <b0ot> Learning Jquery
[11:18:30] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ b0ot
[11:18:31] <bot-t1> b0ot, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[11:18:35] <Eviltwin> I think some of those are available in paper
[11:18:51] <Eviltwin> I didn't use any books to learn
[11:19:17] <y3di> fy3di
[11:19:23] <Eviltwin> But I've always learned better through painfully slow reading of code than a "structured" book
[11:19:25] <y3di> fail find
[11:19:58] <nsanden> ty Evil
[11:19:58] <chrisvwebdev> ha! speaking of javascript books, get "the definitive guide" from oreilly, 6th ed
[11:20:26] <chrisvwebdev> and watch douglas crockford's videos on javascript on the yahoo developer network page
[11:20:35] <Eviltwin> nsanden: http://jsfiddle.net/Kxyzu/32/
[11:20:39] <chrisvwebdev> i would recommend those
[11:21:16] <nsanden> ah! ty again
[11:23:58] <andrew9183> is there a standard practice for retrieving parameters ?
[11:24:02] <andrew9183> url parameters
[11:24:25] <joshsmith> if I have a prototype function, how do I call another prototype function?
[11:24:25] <Eviltwin> window.location.search
[11:24:40] <joshsmith> from within that function
[11:24:42] <Eviltwin> joshsmith: Do you mean like Object.prototype?
[11:24:51] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: yeah
[11:25:03] <Eviltwin> Those functions are called "methods" of the object
[11:25:13] <Eviltwin> And you refer to the instance of the object using the "this" keyword
[11:25:16] <joshsmith> can't I do this.method()?
[11:25:19] <Eviltwin> You can
[11:25:24] <joshsmith> it's not working
[11:25:34] <Eviltwin> Paste(bin) it
[11:26:34] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: https://gist.github.com/1572007
[11:26:58] <joshsmith> in Company.prototype.create, this.hashPassword() doesn't work as expected
[11:27:07] <joshsmith> instead I get undefined is not a function
[11:28:24] <Eviltwin> What's "callback"?
[11:28:36] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: a callback function
[11:29:03] <joshsmith> whoops, I don't have callback defined in the .create() method
[11:29:47] <Eviltwin> Are you using "new Company()" to construct this?
[11:29:59] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: yep
[11:33:35] <joshsmith> Eviltwin: I figured out what I was doing wrong
[11:48:27] <jgspratt> I would like to make it so that when you press ctrl+e on a page, your url is modified by removing a certain number of characters from the front and adding a new, constant string.  how can I do that?
[11:48:52] <Eviltwin> What browsers?
[11:49:46] <Eviltwin> Also, do you want them to actually visit that other page
[11:49:54] <Eviltwin> Or do you just want the URL to change but to stay on the same page?
[11:58:29] <BFranks> ajpiano: Okay I'm a lot more noob than I though I was.. I'm unable to re-use the demo you made http://jsfiddle.net/ajpiano/VsVqs/1/  ... I think the problem is that I'm not taking out the right parts of the interval loop or I'm taking too much out? .. I really don't know enough about the methods you used. :(  Could you remove the interval stuff, and just add a simple example of what I'd call to send an update to the progress bar? .. I'm trying to
[11:58:29] <BFranks> update it with $bar.progressbar("value", howfar);  where 'howfar' is the percent in decimal format (( #done / #total) * 100)
[11:58:58] <orentanay> i have an iframe on domain1 that calls it's content from domain2. I'm trying to fire a function on the parent page from within the iframe. This is what I'm using: parent.$(parent.document).contactUsOverlayCloseDeActivate(); But this is not working, saying Permission denied to access property $, any ideas what I'm doing wrong? thanks.
[11:59:11] <ajpiano> BFranks: that's what you'd do
[11:59:15] <Eviltwin> BFranks: How about you make the changes and click "Update"
[11:59:32] <BFranks> Yeah I can show you how I broke it.. one sec.. ;)
[12:01:26] <BFranks> LOL.. http://jsfiddle.net/VsVqs/2/  ... Works fine of course.. ;p
[12:01:30] <BinaryMaster> Can anyone tell me why when I use this $('body').delegate('.item-selector','change',function(){console.log('here');}); it fires off twice for every one change
[12:01:36] <BFranks> Arrrgh
[12:01:58] <LordThumper> Is there an jQuery UI Sortable event that is fired when a Sortable list is updated (order changed, number of items remains the same) but not when a Sortable list increases or decreases in size (items are transferred to a connected list)
[12:02:41] <z0n3d> BinaryMaster, maybe you have more than one element with "item-selector" class?
[12:03:00] <Eviltwin> BinaryMaster: I suggest running $(".item-selector") in the console and seeing how many things pop up
[12:03:09] <z0n3d> ^
[12:03:10] <Eviltwin> If one's inside the other, it would definitely trigger the change event twice
[12:03:34] <BinaryMaster> I get [] back
[12:03:56] <Eviltwin> BinaryMaster: jsFiddle time
[12:04:00] <z0n3d> then you have something else logging out "here" lol
[12:04:10] <BFranks> ajpiano: OMFG.. I had a comma ruining the last 3 hours.. I'm so looking forward to the weekend
[12:04:18] <BinaryMaster> http://71.101.89.6:81/menu/manage
[12:04:21] <Eviltwin> Better than a coma ruining the last 3 hours
[12:04:23] <ajpiano> :|
[12:04:25] <BinaryMaster> click on the new button
[12:04:39] <ajpiano> BFranks: sorry im on the phone atm anyhow
[12:04:39] <BinaryMaster> give a name then click the button
[12:04:46] <BinaryMaster> then the selector will be there
[12:04:49] <Eviltwin> ajpiano: What kind of phone?
[12:05:46] <BFranks> ajpiano: Oh no worries, I was just face palming and figured it out after testing it in JS fiddle.. I swear my far left screen is harder to read or something.. just didn't see the comma that was breaking the code

[12:05:58] <zamba> how do i count the number of rows in a table and assign the value to a variable in javascript?
[12:06:09] <Eviltwin> $("#mytable tr").length
[12:06:22] <Eviltwin> var theNumberOfRowsInTheTable = $("#mytable tr").length;
[12:06:39] <Eviltwin> Or I guess, technically you'd want "#mytable > tr"
[12:06:55] <Eviltwin> But that neglects tbodies and theads
[12:07:00] <Eviltwin> You'll figure it out
[12:07:07] <zamba> Eviltwin: oh, thanks :)
[12:07:36] <Eviltwin> If anyone's looking to make their website run a little slower, I highly recommend this: http://jsfiddle.net/ULdXK/

[12:09:53] <jimmyrcom> that's really cool
[12:10:38] <fris> im trying to fadeout the no matches after 3 seconds, but results are being faded out on first click, only want it for the no matches http://pastebin.com/yv1u22dx
[12:11:38] * xrated is really bad with doing cool effects in JS :(
[12:12:05] <Eviltwin> fris: I didn't understand the question. Can you rephrase?
[12:13:00] <fris> live example here http://frumpy.ca the first click the result fades away ( on letters) the ones with no matches i want to disappear after 3 seconds
[12:13:14] <fris> only no matches
[12:13:45] <someprimetime> dang almost 1k people in here
[12:15:45] <someprimetime> i'm trying to figure out how to fix this animation to be more "graceful" http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/K9EYk/9/ when I specify an entire row at a time in the rightClick() function, I'm basically appending the next 5 panels (compare with setting var singleScroll to true), but the animation gets dicey. Any idea on how to clean this transition up?
[12:19:52] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: You know animations queue, right?
[12:20:17] <someprimetime> ah so i should clear the queue?
[12:20:34] <Eviltwin> I'm saying you don't need .not(':animated')
[12:21:33] <Eviltwin> So I don't understand
[12:21:35] <Eviltwin> There are "rows" now?
[12:21:38] <Eviltwin> What does that mean
[12:21:40] <someprimetime> well if i get rid of that, the user can click it a ton of times and it'll go way too fast
[12:21:59] <someprimetime> a row is the entire ul
[12:22:09] <roylemc> I'm having trouble getting $(document).on('click', '.my-class', function ... to fire on an iPhone.  Anyone experienced this?
[12:22:11] <someprimetime> so it initially starts off with 5 li elements within it
[12:22:16] <someprimetime> so that would be the row
[12:22:24] <someprimetime> maybe that's a badly named variablee
[12:23:06] <Eviltwin> roylemc: If you're not clicking a link, click events don't bubble in iOS
[12:23:20] <Eviltwin> Unless you've bound an event listener to the clicked element
[12:23:29] <Eviltwin> That .on syntax relies on event bubbling
[12:23:31] <roylemc> the click is on a link
[12:23:52] <cybersholt> theres a good plugin for jquery for iOS to change click to touch events
[12:23:59] <cybersholt> i dont recall the name tho\
[12:24:06] <Eviltwin> cybersholt: Helpful :P
[12:24:17] <cybersholt> :_
[12:24:20] <cybersholt> :P
[12:24:46] <cybersholt> that is a pain in the arse when u're startin out on iOS
[12:25:00] <roylemc> yeah, I'm finding that out quickly
[12:25:29] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: I'm going to warn you, this is not what I would call a maintainable design right here
[12:25:30] <fris> Eviltwin any idea on my sitation?
[12:25:42] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: yeah, it definitely needs to be cleaned up
[12:25:45] <Eviltwin> fris: Still not understanding what you're asking
[12:25:57] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: If by cleaned up you mean redesigned, then yes
[12:25:59] <someprimetime> but i just need to get the functionality down correctly until i go back and refactor stuff
[12:26:00] <ch3mical> Did a server just die?
[12:26:00] <someprimetime> haha
[12:26:02] <someprimetime> really?
[12:26:13] <cybersholt> just google for a plugin or you can use jq mobile and that takes care of it nativly and would probly be better for ya royal
[12:26:32] <fris> i only want the result to be hidden after clicking it (only the no results) right now regular letter results are being hidden on the first click
[12:26:45] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: I think you're going to want to ditch the relative positioning
[12:26:50] <BFranks> Wow.. I have more than a comma out of place, This is my test page (I've stripped it down to just this one issue) http://pastebin.com/ju07V6Fh  .. and this is the exact same code working nicely in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/F9QQZ/1/   I must be having a brain fart.. I see no difference?
[12:26:51] <roylemc> Do you use jqmobile by itself? or do you have to include the full jquery as well?
[12:27:14] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: why so?
[12:27:17] <cybersholt> you need jq too but jq mobile is very light and falls back nice on older devices
[12:27:31] <roylemc> ...cause I tried that and it messed up a few things
[12:27:47] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Because when you shift elements to the front, you need to offset by their width
[12:27:53] <cybersholt> hmmm give me a sec ill find that good plugin for ya royal
[12:27:54] <Eviltwin> Which means you need to calculate their width then
[12:27:59] <Eviltwin> And grab the right elements
[12:28:01] <Eviltwin> It's messy
[12:28:17] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: good point.
[12:28:36] <te-brian2> in jq1.7, is there a way I can do something like a $.each() for elements in the future?
[12:28:40] <Eviltwin> Is your goal to be able to do both row scrolling and single scrolling in the same thing?
[12:28:45] <Eviltwin> te-brian2: ...
[12:28:49] <roylemc> I'll keep pounding on it and see if I can figure anything out
[12:28:51] <codeinfused> how do you use the bot again?
[12:28:52] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: yes
[12:28:54] <roylemc> thanks
[12:29:05] <Eviltwin> cybersholt: Depends on what you want it to do
[12:29:10] <te-brian2> Eviltwin: ... ? :)
[12:29:25] <cybersholt> yea true that i found a fairly universal one the other day
[12:29:29] <Eviltwin> te-brian2: No and there never will be
[12:29:40] <Eviltwin> codeinfused: Depends on what you want it to do
[12:29:43] <te-brian2> Eviltwin: live() is deprecated at this point correct?
[12:29:50] <Eviltwin> te-brian2: Yes
[12:29:50] <futurehitsdonte> Hello jQuery world
[12:29:59] <cybersholt> cant find it for the life of me
[12:30:00] <Eviltwin> Use .delegate instead (or the .delegate syntax in .on)
[12:30:02] <te-brian2> Eviltwin: hmmm.... I guess I have to hack a setInterval lol
[12:30:03] <someprimetime> te-brian2: use delegate if you need to, but use on() now
[12:30:10] <Eviltwin> Don't you dare
[12:30:12] <codeinfused> a jquery help search.. is the command "help"?
[12:30:14] <someprimetime> o.O
[12:30:25] <Eviltwin> A setInterval?
[12:30:27] <te-brian2> Eviltwin: I need to bind an on() to an element that I have no controll over when it will exist
[12:30:37] <Eviltwin> ?.on @ te-brian2
[12:30:41] <te-brian2> Eviltwin: and I do not want to bind to body
[12:31:05] <Eviltwin> Why not?
[12:31:14] <Eviltwin> codeinfused: Bot appears to be dead ATM
[12:31:29] <codeinfused> Oh, that sucks
[12:31:32] <te-brian2> Eviltwin: becuasethe event in question is mouseover.. and if I bind that to body it will destroy performance yes?
[12:31:50] <Eviltwin> So don't bind to the body
[12:31:55] <Eviltwin> Bind to something lower down
[12:32:03] <Eviltwin> te-brian2: How about you walk me through your goal
[12:32:13] <Eviltwin> What you're trying to accomplish
[12:32:14] <someprimetime> te-brian2: you could always put it in a div wrapper and bind to that?
[12:32:41] <te-brian2> Eviltwin: Lemme get specific   ..  a script out of my control adds an element to the bottom of body.  I want to bind mouseover to sub-elements of that element.
[12:33:04] <te-brian2> Eviltwin: I have no way of knowing when that element will exist and if my code will run before or after it.
[12:33:13] <Eviltwin> Why not?
[12:33:17] <Eviltwin> This seems like a really poor design
[12:33:25] <someprimetime> te-brian2: i'm kind of curious what the test case is?
[12:33:26] <SirCmpwn> $("span").click(function) isn't working for me
[12:33:26] <te-brian2> Eviltwin: Blame Drupal 6 :)
[12:33:29] <SirCmpwn> is this common?
[12:33:34] <someprimetime> what element is being added?
[12:33:38] <someprimetime> and why
[12:33:49] <Eviltwin> And why mouseovers?
[12:33:52] <BFranks> Yeah I can strip this right down and it makes no sense.. Endless karma to the first person who can spot the difference between the code that won't work locally: http://pastebin.com/Xgj3MyFS and the same code working over on jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/F9QQZ/1/   ?
[12:34:17] <thebignoise> does anyone know why my animations go all jittery when i try using flash so i can copy text
[12:34:34] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: 'Cause Flash is a CPU and memory clusterfuck
[12:34:45] <te-brian2> someprimetime: If you are familiar with Drupal.. it has functionality called "Sticky Headers" ... a 'core' script searches for tables with a class and clones a table header that can stick to the top durign window scrolling.  Due to how Drupal behaviors are looped throuh.. I can't make my script run after the core one.
[12:35:09] <SirCmpwn> actually, most javascript has to be included in a page to work
[12:35:11] <SirCmpwn> whoops XD
[12:35:18] <te-brian2> someprimetime: I am trying to add mouseover behavior to 'th' tags inside that eventually created sticky header.
[12:36:02] <someprimetime> te-brian2: so why not write your own plugin that adds a class like js-sticky-container to whatever div you want?
[12:36:30] <te-brian2> someprimetime: Not following you...
[12:37:08] <someprimetime> well what determines which th's get cloned?
[12:37:31] <someprimetime> you must be the one specifying which ones you want cloned, right?
[12:37:50] <awolfey> Is it possible to have a jquery ui slider init with a NULL value?
[12:38:26] <someprimetime> te-brian2: you mean something like this: http://robertfall.github.com/Stuck-On-Top/ ?
[12:38:44] <te-brian2> someprimetime: Roughly yes...
[12:38:54] <te-brian2> someprimetime: I think am following you though...
[12:39:16] <te-brian2> someprimetime: The code out of my controll does call $.clone(true) ... so if I bind properly... the event handling shoudl transfer?
[12:39:28] <Pilate> BFranks: the element doesnt exist when you add the handler locally
[12:39:33] <te-brian2> someprimetime: To the cloned element
[12:40:05] <Pilate> BFranks: http://pastebin.com/stpqvtdu
[12:41:56] <SirCmpwn> I'm having issues with .click() hitting my event handler twice
[12:42:00] <SirCmpwn> how to solve these?
[12:42:54] <Eviltwin> Stop binding your listener twice
[12:42:55] <thebignoise> Eviltwin: ha ok
[12:43:10] <SirCmpwn> $("div.portfolio>span").click(function () {
[12:47:21] <thebignoise> is there a way to know if a function is done 'loading' everything
[12:48:10] <Eviltwin> Uh...
[12:48:17] <iamjarvo> thebignoise:  like when the page is done loading

[12:48:18] <Eviltwin> Functions don't "load"
[12:48:40] <thebignoise> Eviltwin: lol i know thats why its in quotes.
[12:48:45] <thebignoise> iamjarvo: not really
[12:48:50] <thebignoise> i have animations
[12:49:00] <thebignoise> but when i try to load this gay flash copy it messes them up
[12:49:09] <thebignoise> so i load it after they are 'done' but it still messes them up
[12:49:38] <Eviltwin> You need to use a callback or deferred from the animation
[12:51:38] <thebignoise> not sure im following
[12:51:58] <Eviltwin> Not sure I want you to follow
[12:52:26] <thebignoise> Eviltwin: i can't exactly attach .done to animation
[12:53:34] <jstout24> if i have a form that has selects with names like, my_form[variations][0][page], my_form[variations][0][position] -- my_form[variations][1][page], my_form[variations][1][position].. how can i get that into an array so i can something like do $.each(my_form[variations]... if (key == 'position') { ... do logic with this value ... }, etc, etc
[12:53:42] <Eviltwin> thebignoise: I'd take a look at this http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/02/merging-jquery-deferreds-and-animate
[12:54:19] <Eviltwin> Or perhaps this: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[12:54:21] <jstout24> form serializeArray() just returns objects that look with names like, "my_form[variations][1][page]"
[12:54:44] <Eviltwin> jstout24: You can't
[12:54:53] <Eviltwin> Not directly
[12:55:46] <BFranks> Pilate: Perfect.. Thanks for that.. My big problem now is that at low %s the bar's not wide enough to display any text.. hahaha.. ;)
[13:00:53] <cybersholt> Eviltwin: found that plugin and got it fixed for that other person you might be interested in it http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-for-ipad-and-iphone/
[13:07:06] <shwaiil> hi
[13:07:35] <shwaiil> Q: Can someone help me, on how to make the following example, to use "this" in a object context ? Thanks for looking http://jsfiddle.net/b6hRN/
[13:07:52] <shwaiil> My question is, how to make "this" work in a object context!
[13:08:50] <shwaiil> Also, to search in google about this, I've used "closures" but didnt find the examples I need. I 've read the rhino book a few time ago and had some experience, having this working. But since I dont do many frontend stuff, from time to time I forget stuff
[13:08:56] <shwaiil> any help would be appreciated, thanks
[13:10:49] <Eviltwin> "this" and closures are two different things
[13:11:16] <tidwell> hey, im working on a plugin that is called via $.plugin instead of $(elements) - is it still best practice to return something from the init call (like, I don't know… window or something)?
[13:11:22] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/b6hRN/1/
[13:11:55] <Eviltwin> tidwell: In that case it doesn't matter so much what you return
[13:12:22] <tidwell> Eviltwin: yea, it doesnt really make sense to return anything - prolly more confusing if it does
[13:12:52] <shwaiil> Eviltwin: oh missed the return lol
[13:12:55] <shwaiil> tks a lot for looking
[13:18:37] <verwilst> heyhey! i have 3 divs, with <ul>'s in it, set sortable. Now i would like to save the order and location in mysql when dragging them to another position in one of the 3 divs
[13:19:18] <verwilst> i added an update: function() {} to the $('ul').sortable(), but it never passed any params ( even though it posts to the page i gave it )
[13:19:42] <verwilst> update : function (event, ui) { var serial = $(this).sortable('serialize');$.post("save.php", serial); }
[13:20:15] <verwilst> i have a #col1, #col2 and #col3 with ul's in em
[13:20:15] <tidwell> another plugin dev question, when calling a user-submitted callback, does it make sense to fire it with an object literal or multiple arguments?  jQuery core seems to do both, as do most plugins
[13:20:26] <muzone> Hey!
[13:20:46] <muzone> Anybody know why jQuery Dialog (trying to create a simple modal window) won't load in this case? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/KnSS3/
[13:21:07] <xarxer> Is it possible to traverse over all the elements named "div#entry_*" where * is an integer?
[13:21:16] <xarxer> They're all in order for that matter.. i.e 1 through 10
[13:21:37] <gurde> why $('ul#mylist li div.info').on('click', function(event) { console.log(this) }); havin 3 li elements, will it log on first element click 1 time and the 3 element 3 times?
[13:24:34] <gurde> clicking one one of the LI will log it 3 times, same element
[13:24:43] <gurde> on the other element 2 times
[13:24:49] <gurde> and the other element just 1 time
[13:25:08] <gurde> what am i doing wrong?
[13:27:18] <gurde> never mind, figure it out
[13:27:20] <gurde> :D
[13:28:03] <georgeps> @xarxer, you could use a starts-with selector, then run through with .each()

[13:33:06] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: eating lunch so might take awhile to respond. what's up?
[13:33:17] <verwilst> ok, i managed to pass the order of the items in my div to the php page

[13:33:26] <xarxer> georgeps: Much obliged :)
[13:33:35] <verwilst> but when i drag from one div to another, how do i keep track of which one it was dragged to?
[13:35:14] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: you bastard that is super clean!
[13:35:38] <someprimetime> will take me awhile to go through it to digest, but man.. thanks!
[13:35:47] <SirCmpwn> anyone used the lightbox plugin before?
[13:35:56] <someprimetime> i would donate to your donation page (tried to the other day actually), but for some reason it's been discontinued or something?

[13:38:42] <fatninja> I am at a loss, I am using jq validation class, and I have a table row with a input(type : radio) , of td's, and it is required to have one selected, the problem I'm having is with error posting, it puts a label class='error' in the first div, how can I manipulate the way it posts errors ?
[13:39:05] <fatninja> *not the first div, the first td
[13:39:27] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Updated with some helpful comments: http://jsfiddle.net/K9EYk/11/

[13:42:53] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: hey no worries. i appreciate the immense help i've received in this channel, and i'm constantly learning new stuff in it
[13:43:04] <someprimetime> and thanks for the updated comments. will definitely scope out in a few
[13:43:42] <fatninja> any ideas how to manipulate the error posting of jquery validation class ? :D
[13:46:37] <supertrue> How can I modify the DOM of a dynamically generated iframe (e.g. a thickbox created by clicking on a link)? jQuery('iframe').contents().find( 'html' ).css('border', '5px solid red'); works when I run it in the console, but when I include the same code in the page (the page containing the link to the thickbox), it has no effect.
[13:47:18] <solidus-river> hey guys can event handlers take they symbol of a function or do they have to actually take the function?
[13:48:01] <Eviltwin> You mean like alert vs function() {... }
[13:49:59] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: yeah sorry, that was pretty vague, i'm making a jsfiddle to clarify the situation
[13:50:12] <Eviltwin> JavaScript effectively doesn't distinguish between the two
[13:50:34] <Eviltwin> In terms of the way the function receives it
[13:51:21] <SirCmpwn> trying to get the jquery lightbox plugin working here, having some trouble: http://dsoft.dsofttechhosting.net/portfolio/military-and-civil-space/
[13:52:16] <solidus-river> is there a body load event?
[13:52:24] <SirCmpwn> yes
[13:52:26] <SirCmpwn> portfolio.js
[13:52:35] <solidus-river> whats the event called?
[13:52:57] <SirCmpwn> well, it's just $(document).ready(function()
[13:53:11] <_xor> );
[13:53:11] <SirCmpwn> I know it gets called because the other code inside works fine
[13:53:19] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: http://jsfiddle.net/HVDM3/
[13:53:24] <_xor> I just do: $(function() { ... });
[13:53:26] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by body load?
[13:55:16] <_xor> I'm thinking about using jQuery Mobile, but I only want to load it on devices that support touch input (ex: swipes).
[13:55:34] <_xor> I'm already using CSS3 media queries for load different styles for various widths.
[13:55:48] <SirCmpwn> you should probably sniff the user agent
[13:55:52] <_xor> ...but I'm trying to figure out a way to do that to load jQuery Mobile for touch-input capable devices.
[13:55:57] <_xor> I hate user agent sniffing.
[13:56:05] <solidus-river> damn, i'm trying to find out how to initialize any element with the class 'pretty-button' by doing a $(this).button(); when it enters the page or on page load
[13:56:06] <_xor> I'll use it if I have to, but I hate it.
[13:56:07] <SirCmpwn> this is probably not something you can do on the client
[13:56:09] <_xor> Such a hack-ish way to do it.
[13:56:20] <_xor> What, user-agent sniffing?
[13:56:28] <SirCmpwn> checking for swipe support
[13:56:36] <_xor> Yeah
[13:56:41] <_xor> WAIT A SECOND HERE
[13:56:48] <_xor> Does Modernizr have a property for it?
[13:57:02] <freenodiz> Hello, I have some experience debugging css/html issues with google chrome dev tools.Now i need to debug a menu, wich contains some jquery.Wich tool can i use to debug the menu?the standard tools i've been using doesn't wirk, as the menu is dynamic, things doesn't "freeze".
[13:57:07] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: this is what i'm talking about, it doesn't seem to work
[13:57:08] <solidus-river> http://jsfiddle.net/qhqCu/1/
[13:57:28] <Eviltwin> Ah, that's a whole different ballgame
[13:57:39] <_xor> OOOOOOOH
[13:57:44] <_xor> Yeeeessss...I found it.
[13:57:48] <_xor> Modernizr.touch
[13:57:52] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/#function.this
[13:57:56] <Eviltwin> Read through that
[13:58:07] <_xor> I can use that and confirm it with viewport widths (if it's less than 1024 or so)
[13:58:21] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: Up to Closures and References
[13:58:34] <Eviltwin> (Or through Clousres and References if you're interested)
[13:58:46] <_xor> My two options were...
[13:58:48] <_xor> A) Check client display width, and if it's small enough, it's probably a touch-screen capable device (ex: phone or tablet)
[13:58:52] <_xor> B) User agent sniffing
[13:58:56] <_xor> I hate boht of those
[13:59:05] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: so need to attach () to the end in order for it to be interpreted as a function?
[13:59:07] <Eviltwin> _xor: You're doing JavaScript, right?
[13:59:13] <_xor> Eviltwin: Yeah
[13:59:14] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: Read
[13:59:17] <SirCmpwn> trying to get the jquery lightbox plugin working here, having some trouble: http://dsoft.dsofttechhosting.net/portfolio/military-and-civil-space/
[13:59:27] <Eviltwin> _xor: I consider checking the display with to be feature detection
[13:59:32] <Eviltwin> Which is the right way to do it
[13:59:38] <_xor> Checking display width?
[13:59:41] <_xor> HEEELLLL No
[14:00:05] <_xor> In an ideal world, the browser would set a capability for it (which is what Modernizr.touch basically is, and which is what I'm going to use)
[14:00:29] <_xor> ...but what happens when something like iPad 3 comes out this year?  It's supposed to have a 2560 width.
[14:00:42] <_xor> Which will "break" those sites that rely on width testing and make assumptions.
[14:00:50] <_xor> I hate that crap.  I'd rather go without it instead, rather than rely on that.
[14:01:11] <_xor> I use Modernizr anyway.  I just didn't realize it had that flag.
[14:01:19] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: Actually you have a number of problems here
[14:01:36] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: i'm all ears, i've updated the fiddle some
[14:01:46] <solidus-river> http://jsfiddle.net/qhqCu/3/
[14:01:54] <sabi> hi, i am confused by .has(...) - http://jsfiddle.net/xNjUb/ - am i doing something wrong?
[14:02:08] <Eviltwin> ?.has @ sabi
[14:02:15] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[14:02:19] <Eviltwin> Have you read this? http://api.jquery.com/has/
[14:02:38] <sabi> yes, i'm still confused :) the code is very short, should make it clear where i'm confused
[14:02:42] <_xor> I am using CSS media queries (max-width) for different layouts and progressive enhancement.
[14:03:19] <solidus-river> wow updating, sorry syntax foul
[14:03:44] <Eviltwin> sabi: This might help: http://jsfiddle.net/xNjUb/1/
[14:04:05] <Eviltwin> I might actually consider that a bug
[14:04:42] <sabi> hrm, interesting, so i need to provide more context
[14:04:50] <sabi> thanks
[14:05:10] <nicksergeant> url 1
[14:05:12] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: http://jsfiddle.net/qhqCu/5/
[14:05:19] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: still reading through that article though
[14:05:19] <Eviltwin> Okay
[14:05:22] <Eviltwin> So this is the issue
[14:05:36] <Eviltwin> I'm going to show you something that should help explain
[14:06:22] <Eviltwin> Actually...
[14:06:23] <Eviltwin> Before I do
[14:06:24] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/qhqCu/6/
[14:06:39] <Eviltwin> See if you can figure out what I changed
[14:08:52] <Eviltwin> On a semi-related note
[14:08:58] <Eviltwin> Does this make sense to you? http://jsfiddle.net/yuWrt/
[14:09:04] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: LOL, "intializer" !== "initializer"
[14:09:10] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: Yup
[14:10:59] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: yes because your using the this which then points to object B, youve just pulled the definition of the funciton from objectA and placed it in a property of objectB
[14:11:08] <Eviltwin> Yup
[14:11:12] <Eviltwin> Just wanted to make sure
[14:11:16] <Eviltwin> That throws people sometimes
[14:11:31] <Eviltwin> If you were to do window.initializer.initialize()
[14:11:37] <Eviltwin> "this" would be window.initializer
[14:12:00] <Eviltwin> Whereas in the setup you have, it's going to be the clicked element
[14:12:01] <solidus-river> yeah, i only use this in that way in callback functions i intend for use in handlers
[14:12:50] <solidus-river> actually, i was a little worried when converting this code, i have about 2100 lines of jscript i've converted this week so anything i wanted to be the method or value of an attribute of the object i called from the window scope even within the object
[14:13:05] <solidus-river> i hope that doesn't mess with efficiency to much, its just some extra pointer arithmatic, right?
[14:14:12] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: Not quite sure what you mean
[14:14:19] <Eviltwin> (Maybe rephrase)
[14:14:26] <Eviltwin> Or just w/e
[14:15:44] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: so i've been converting this chunk of js for a site into the schema I used on jsfiddle, if I ever wanted to reference a function that was defined in the same object i would reference it not from this.name but from window.object.name  I wanted to be safe but thinking back on it, i assumed this was just some more pointer arithmatic starting from window instead of the current scope to resolve the function, will this slow down 
[14:16:02] <Kottizen> Hi, does anything know what I'm missing here? http://privatepaste.com/7fa417c4ca I don't get any errors (suggesting it's a fatal mistake), and when I put an alert() on line 13 and hit 'Sök!', I didn't get it. When I click the button, the page just reloads.
[14:16:57] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: I think it's about 50-100% slower to do it that way but it's a question of like half a nanosecond per property
[14:17:00] <Eviltwin> And it gets cached
[14:18:58] <neybar> I have an IE issue.  I have a set of divs, the first one has a class='selected answer'.  then I have an event that runs $('.answer').removeClass('selected').  In IE, when that event fires, it crashed IE, but it work if I put IE in compatibility mode.
[14:19:01] <solidus-river> kk, so eventually i should switch but its not a big concern
[14:19:16] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: thanks for the help :)
[14:19:35] <dizzyone> solidus-river
[14:19:46] <dizzyone> might be me, but I see a memberslistsearch
[14:19:49] <dizzyone> not a memberslist
[14:21:30] <dizzyone> probably just the ajax not doing anything though, can't see the rest
[14:21:38] <dragon> I'm trying to process links on a page as soon as they are created. I can use $('a').live() or $('a').on() to attach a click handler to all anchors and do whatever, but I'd like to do that when the links are created, instead.
[14:21:55] <dragon> What's a decent approach for this?
[14:22:24] <SirCmpwn> does anone know of a lightbox plugin that works with the latest jquery?
[14:22:28] <Eviltwin> First, don't use .live, it's deprecated
[14:22:31] <neybar> couldn't you just do that in what ever process is creating the links?
[14:23:04] <Eviltwin> And is it all links? All links of a certain class?
[14:23:27] <Eviltwin> Thanks ajpiano and rworth. You guys didn't have to do that.
[14:23:39] <dragon> neybar: they can be created by document.write("<a href='...'>...</a>"). I have little control over that part.
[14:24:04] <Eviltwin> Also not pretty
[14:24:05] <dragon> Eviltwin: fair enough. .on() is the replacement for .live(), but I couldn't figure a way to achieve this using .on().
[14:24:10] <Eviltwin> Ah
[14:24:26] <dragon> Eviltwin: and it's for all links.
[14:24:33] <Eviltwin> If you had $("a").live("click", f), you now do $(document).on("click", "a", f);
[14:24:39] <Eviltwin> There are actually two selectors involved
[14:24:46] <Eviltwin> I call it the "delegate" syntax
[14:24:53] <Eviltwin> Because it was originally .delegate
[14:25:03] <dragon> yes, but I'm trying to capture the link's creation event, not click event.
[14:25:04] <meese|air> http://jsfiddle.net/meesebyte/Y9rbK/274/ I don't want both .portclick and .infoclick to react when just one is hovered over, but for some reason they do.
[14:25:30] <Eviltwin> There's no good way to capture the creation of them, unfortunately
[14:25:36] <Eviltwin> Why are you trying to do that?
[14:26:00] <solidus-river> EvilTwin: does on get called everytime a new child is entered onto the page that matches the filter, or is it only called when a click event is recieved?
[14:26:07] <dragon> I'm trying to get the link's href, send it to server for processing, and update href with server's response.
[14:26:23] <Eviltwin> solidus-river: .delegate / .on ?
[14:26:33] <danzik171> dragon: who's creating these links?  you?
[14:26:37] <solidus-river> Eviltwin: .on with the delegate syntax
[14:26:50] <dragon> Currently I'm making the server call on hover, and counting on getting server response before the user clicks.
[14:27:10] <Eviltwin> meese|air: Is this what you're looking for? http://jsfiddle.net/Y9rbK/276/
[14:27:23] <dragon> danzik171: No, I'm using candy-chat, a JS based XMPP client. The chat portion creates links when users post something.
[14:27:31] <ajpiano> you're welcome Eviltwin
[14:27:39] <danzik171> dragon: why don't you just do it on the click event and prevent the default action.  on response, set document.location.href to whatever you want?
[14:28:00] <danzik171> ( do show some loading icon so it's user friendly... )
[14:28:14] <solidus-river> dragon: you could set up an ajax complete event and use .on with that to initialize any links you might have loaded i think, however i'm not 100% sure on this as i dont think the complete event is called after you handle the response, only after you get the response
[14:28:28] <dragon> danzik171: external links open in new tabs. Can I open new tabs without triggering a popup blocker?

[14:30:39] <dragon> solidus-river: in that case, I'd be tweaking the chat client to capture the ajax complete, then scan for new links.
[14:30:40] <meese|air> gotcha
[14:30:45] <Eviltwin> meese|air: Have you done much JavaScript before?
[14:30:58] <solidus-river> dragon: yeah, isn't that valid?
[14:30:58] <meese|air> some, not really
[14:31:00] <meese|air> :P
[14:31:07] <Eviltwin> Then I strongly suggest you see ?learn
[14:31:13] <Eviltwin> (Ugh, no bot)
[14:31:22] <meese|air> heh
[14:31:22] <Eviltwin> Go here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript
[14:31:30] <Eviltwin> Figure out what level you're at
[14:31:34] <Eviltwin> And read through some of those
[14:31:36] <meese|air> I am currently learning javascript
[14:31:40] <Eviltwin> Try to understand the advanced stuff
[14:31:45] <dragon> solidus-river: I was trying to build around the client without tweaking it. Also, it'll be nice to have the mechanism automatically apply to links created through other sources.
[14:31:49] <Eviltwin> Then read through this: http://jqfundamentals.com/
[14:32:01] <meese|air> eviltwin: been using codecademy
[14:32:06] <Eviltwin> It's a bad idea to try to learn jQuery and JavaScript simultaneously as jQuery uses a lot of advanced JavaScript topics
[14:32:16] <meese|air> eh
[14:32:21] <meese|air> I learn in a weird way :/
[14:32:30] <meese|air> I just seek to do what I need to do
[14:32:37] <meese|air> but like learning stuff on the way
[14:32:48] <meese|air> super busy, right now trying to improve site
[14:33:43] <Eviltwin> If you do it right, you can cut about 80% of this: http://pastebin.com/ZYrhk23x
[14:33:52] <Eviltwin> Actually probably more than 80%
[14:33:58] <kagi> I've got a question in relation to the .attr() method.
[14:35:10] <dragon> Is there an "attach" or "load" event for an anchor that could be captured using .on()?
[14:35:20] <Eviltwin> dragon: No
[14:35:41] <kagi> I'm trying to fix a bug in IE resulting from ELEMENT.setAttribute().
[14:35:58] <Eviltwin> dragon: If this is strictly for prototype purposes (not for live real code)
[14:36:07] <meese|air> eviltwin: yeah,  I was originally following a tutorial for buttons, and the slideshows obviously aren't actually buttons since I'm just using a hyperlink overtop of them
[14:36:08] <Eviltwin> You can use a setInterval for some small interval
[14:36:20] <Eviltwin> And check for links that you haven't seen yet
[14:36:28] <Eviltwin> Don't ever do something like that in production though
[14:36:59] <Eviltwin> meese|air: Also, eval() is considered a bad practice and you'll learn more about that as you learn more about JavaScript
[14:37:09] <Eviltwin> Anyway, I'll BBL
[14:37:20] <snover> by “bad practice” eviltwin means “never use it. ever. if you are thinking of using it, you are doing it wrong”
[14:37:44] <dragon> Eviltwin: it's for production, and users are expected to leave the tab open in the background.
[14:37:48] <Eviltwin> That might be an exact quote from me on "eval"
[14:38:12] <Eviltwin> dragon: Then you're going to need to change their code
[14:38:52] <dragon> Alright. what do I do when I capture an event stating that something has been updated on the page?
[14:39:03] <sphinxxx> is application craft owned by jquery?
[14:39:18] <dragon> Is there a way to narrow the scope of event handler to newly created anchors?
[14:40:12] <kagi> after iterating through the elements on a page and finding the one I want to set attributes on, I set it to a variable, "COMMENT_BOX" I then call COMMENT_BOX.setAttribute( "onkeyup", "jsFunction1(); jsfunction2();" ); Only the first function gets set.
[14:40:35] <snover> you are doing it so wrong.
[14:40:40] <snover> 1. ALL_CAPS is for constants.
[14:40:58] <snover> 2. if you want to attach an event listener, use $.fn.on
[14:41:02] <kagi> (side note: trying to fix someone elses bug as quick as possible)
[14:41:04] <danheberden> (CONSTANTLY_AWESOME_VARIABLES_THAT_IS)
[14:42:46] <kagi> I was curious if this would work: $(COMMENT_BOX).attr("onkeyup", "jsfunction1(); jsfunction2();"); would work to select that variable.
[14:45:21] <danheberden> that would assign a string to that attr
[14:45:40] <snover> kagi: stop.
[14:45:47] <danheberden> $( COMMENT_BOX).on( 'keyup', function(){ jsfunction1(); jsfunction2(); });
[14:45:49] <danheberden> but eww
[14:46:39] <kagi> I don't expect it to be pretty, and Im not happy about it. Just trying to get this bug fixed.
[14:47:07] <kagi> danheberden: thank you. I'll give that a shot.
[14:47:16] <danheberden> kagi, it's not a matter of pretty - it's just, like, not spending 5 minutes to learn about 'on' to make YOUR life easier, ya know?
[14:47:23] <dragon> kagi: unless you get paid for the number of bugs you fix, it's the best to write maintainable code.
[14:47:32] <danheberden> we don't bark about good/bad practice because it's fun
[14:47:35] <danheberden> well, it's kinda fun
[14:47:40] <kagi> =]
[14:47:45] <danheberden> but mostly you'll benefit - even in shitty situations like this
[14:48:02] <danheberden> and when we're adamant about it, it's cuz we've been there
[14:48:13] <snover> danheberden: whatever, i always wrote perfect code
[14:48:18] <danheberden> uh huh
[14:48:18] <snover> even when I was a youngun
[14:48:33] <danheberden> just like you wrote perfect swoons onto my heart
[14:48:37] * danheberden swoons
[14:56:43] <SirCmpwn> how to get the kind of element that fired a click event?
[14:56:54] <SirCmpwn> for instance, if an <a> and a <div> are both hooked up to the same event...
[14:57:23] <dragon> SirCmpwn: something like event.source() I suppose.
[14:57:38] <SirCmpwn> is there a $(this).type, perhaps?
[14:57:47] <dragon> where event is the event object passed to the handler.
[14:57:59] <danheberden> $( '.something' ).on( 'click', function( event ){ if ( /a/i.test( event.target.nodeName ) ){ /* do stuff if an a */ } );
[14:58:08] <danheberden> err, add an extra closing brace there
[14:58:32] <danheberden> so either event.target.nodeName, this.nodeName, or $( this ).prop( 'nodeName' )
[14:58:43] <SirCmpwn> nodeName?
[14:58:49] <SirCmpwn> event.target.nodeName === "a"
[14:59:02] <danheberden>  /a/i will check for A or a
[14:59:20] <danheberden> not all browsers are consistently "A"
[14:59:20] <SirCmpwn> thanks
[14:59:37] <danheberden> though `this` in that event handler is the same as event.target
[14:59:46] <danheberden> if you bound directly to those elements
[14:59:49] <Schyzo> sorry to bother you with easy questions, but what does jQuery(function($){ mean ?
[14:59:59] <dragon> also, wouldn't it make more sense to attach separate event handlers to a and div, given they aren't doing the same thing after all.
[15:00:07] <danheberden> jQuery( fn ) is a shortcut for jQuery( document ).ready( fn );
[15:00:09] <SirCmpwn> it would
[15:00:10] <xrated> It's short hand for jQuery(document).ready(function($) {}) Schyzo
[15:00:11] <danheberden> Schyzo ^
[15:00:15] <SirCmpwn> perhaps I should talk more to the point here
[15:00:19] <SirCmpwn> http://dsoft.dsofttechhosting.net/portfolio/military-and-civil-space/
[15:00:24] <danheberden> and the first argument in that callback is jQuery itself, thus the dollar sign
[15:00:30] <SirCmpwn> I want to stop my click handler from firing when the images are clicked
[15:00:44] <danheberden> so jQuery( function($){ /* $ === jQuery and this will run on doc ready */ });
[15:01:16] <danheberden> SirCmpwn so if event.target.nodeName is an IMG then event.preventDefault()
[15:01:38] <Schyzo> what would be the difference with defining a function somewhere and running it with $(document).ready ?
[15:01:50] <SirCmpwn> one second
[15:02:37] <SirCmpwn> danheberden: I just disabled some stuff so you could see the issue: http://dsoft.dsofttechhosting.net/portfolio/military-and-civil-space/
[15:02:40] <danheberden> Schyzo none, really - i find $( document ).ready( fn ) to be much more descritiev
[15:02:46] <danheberden> *descriptive
[15:02:49] <danheberden> of what you're actually doing
[15:02:49] <SirCmpwn> when I re-enable collapsing, then colorbox doesn't work
[15:02:49] <Schyzo> so do I
[15:02:51] <Schyzo> thanks
[15:02:55] <Schyzo> I just wanted to be sure
[15:03:04] <Schyzo> I do have an issue with my jcrop script
[15:03:06] <danheberden> ya, that's the problem with shortcuts - adds confusion :p
[15:03:19] <Schyzo> and I am trying to figure it out, so trying to explain any possible cause
[15:03:54] <danheberden> Schyzo i gotta get back to work, so i'd keep debugging and asking for assistance :D
[15:03:59] <danheberden> good luck!
[15:04:10] <Schyzo> thanks danheberden !
[15:04:29] <SirCmpwn> so I have a colorbox on this page, launched upon clicking an image http://dsoft.dsofttechhosting.net/portfolio/military-and-civil-space/
[15:04:46] <SirCmpwn> normally, I also have the box containing the images collapsed, and it expands while clicking
[15:04:51] <SirCmpwn> when I re-enable this, the colorbox doesn't work
[15:04:54] <SirCmpwn> ideas?
[15:07:55] <famlam> @sindresorhus, do you have a way to test if all $("selector") still correctly match? I think I might have a patch for bug 11137
[15:08:43] <bakers> What's the raw JS way (not jquery) to add a click handler to a dom node?
[15:09:19] <lilmikey> hi
[15:10:06] <sindresorhus> bakers: document.getElementById('id').addEventListener('click', function() {});
[15:11:17] <sindresorhus> famlam:  $('selector').length
[15:12:09] <Schyzo> Anybody could help me out finding what could go weird in my jcrop plugin ?
[15:12:38] <famlam> sindresorhus: No, I mean, do you have a test case page with, say, 1000 different selectors that can be used to test all possibilities, to see if a patch doesn't break anything?
[15:13:05] <sindresorhus> famlam:  Try the jQuery test suit
[15:13:22] <Schyzo> http://pastie.org/3140310 . At some point in the script and for some reasons I can't understand, the c.w value doesn't move anymore...
[15:13:32] <bakers> sindresorhus: can I addEventListener on a collect of nodes. something from queryselectorall()
[15:14:10] <sindresorhus> famlam:  The whole test suit must pass. But hold on. Start by creating an jsfiddle testecase, and wait until it is determined that it is actually a bug.
[15:16:06] <sindresorhus> bakers: No, you get the nodes with for example the qSA and then iterate over them using a loop and add the event listeners.
[15:17:24] <Blaster> Hey when using a parent directory to an image with .css it doesn't work, but when using absolute it works fine.  How come?  ex: $('.tip.openers .one').css('background','url(../img/glow/1.gif) 0 0 no-repeat');
[15:18:44] <famlam> I discussed that with one of the Chrome authors. The regex jquery uses, contains a traditionally called "catastrophic backtracking" (AKA: infinite regex loop). FireFox and Safari return null on that regex (although it actually matches). Chrome doesn't (intentionally).
[15:18:56] <famlam> So Chrome keeps running forever
[15:19:47] <dizzyone> when traversing, trying to apply something to self and its children, does it make sense to do $(e).children().dosomething().andSelf()
[15:19:53] <dizzyone> or is it ugly to do so?
[15:20:05] <snover> famlam: which expression?
[15:20:34] <famlam> the regex called chunker
[15:20:38] <famlam> see issue 11137
[15:20:48] <snover> oh, fun sizzle stuff
[15:33:15] <LekeFly> Can i use jQuery to remove ,00 from this "298,00" ?
[15:33:56] <snover> ?jsisjs @ LekeFly
[15:34:06] <snover> damn it.
[15:34:09] <LekeFly> Hehe
[15:34:30] <snover> LekeFly: jQuery is not a replacement for JavaScript. If you are looking for the jQuery equivalent of &&, ||, setTimeout, etc. you already have it.
[15:35:03] <LekeFly> Well can i use js then :P
[15:35:49] <sente> LekeFly: i'm sure you can
[15:36:47] <LekeFly> Anyone got a idea how to do it? :P can i just search for ,00 in a div and if ,00 exactly matches i can remove it..
[15:37:03] <sente> that's one way
[15:37:41] <sente> would you also want to remove 00 from 194,00 ?
[15:37:49] <vicentiko> helpme #jquery
[15:38:00] <sente> vicentiko: you can tell our hands are full here
[15:38:10] <LekeFly> sente: Yeah.. and ,
[15:38:13] <vicentiko> http://jsfiddle.net/nzU5K/
[15:38:15] <sente> with the 298,00 -> 298 conundrum
[15:38:57] <dabear> vicentiko: use live
[15:39:02] <sente> LekeFly: look up split() or replace()
[15:39:11] <dabear> or the new and fancy shortcut, ".on"
[15:39:54] <Joe``````> I know no one likes having their clicks broken away from native behavior, but do you guys think this is enough to simulate it close enough? if (!e.shiftKey && e.button == 0)
[15:40:09] <Joe``````> They're on actual anchor elements, so if my code does not handle it, it will navigate normally
[15:40:50] <dabear> Joe``````: why not supress native action and just add event handlers for that?
[15:41:08] <dabear> i.e. .click( funciton(){ your code})
[15:41:12] <Joe``````> dabear: I did, but center click not opening a new tab is driving me mental :D
[15:41:26] <dabear> centerclicking?
[15:41:27] <vicentiko> how i can add element to original DOM whitout live??
[15:41:29] <Joe``````>                 .off("click.uinav").on("click.uinav", function (e) {
[15:41:29] <Joe``````>                     if (!e.shiftKey && e.button == 0)
[15:41:29] <Joe``````>                         Hive.Page.navigate(_page, _args);
[15:41:31] <dabear> middle clicking?
[15:41:58] <Joe``````> it's generally the mouse wheel being pressed in
[15:42:10] <dabear> bad idea
[15:42:22] <dabear> what if your app is accessed through an ipad?
[15:42:30] <dabear> or another device without middle clicking?
[15:42:32] <Joe``````> vicentiko: You mean and handle it's events? Look into delegate (and the delegate'like behavior in .on) or add the handler to the new object too
[15:42:40] <Joe``````> dabear: then it'll navigate fine
[15:42:55] <Joe``````> what i want to do is have my code handle navigation if left click is used
[15:43:03] <Joe``````> if not, i want native handling
[15:43:14] <Joe``````> the anchors are always href="#foo"
[15:43:28] <Joe``````> so they're proper anchors, they're not javascript:void(0); or ="#" or something
[15:44:06] <Joe``````> i'm just wondering if there's any other situations where i'd need to let it be handled natively
[15:44:22] <Joe``````> like, is alt + click something?
[15:44:40] <Joe``````> my script lets middle clicking be handled how ever the client was to handle it
[15:46:13] <dabear> so you basically want an animated scroll to an element when an anchor is left clicked?
[15:46:34] <Joe``````> no, because it does not goto that type of anchor :P
[15:46:55] <Joe``````> it's all ajax'y
[15:47:10] <Joe``````> it parses the anchor and makes an appropriate ajax request
[15:48:53] <dabear> ah right
[15:49:04] <dabear> so only do ajax request on left click then, I see
[15:50:41] <Joe``````> ya, and when there's no shift being held
[15:50:53] <Joe``````> do you know of any other weird ones I should be aware of?
[15:50:57] <dabear> Joe``````: don't use button
[15:51:04] <Joe``````> oh?
[15:51:05] <dabear> use event.which == 1
[15:51:14] <dabear> / Note: button is not normalized, so don't use it
[15:51:25] <dabear> according to jquery sources
[15:52:54] <Joe``````> ahhhh
[15:52:56] <Joe``````> good catch
[15:53:31] <dabear> I would kinda assume that any modifier key actually modifies behavior somewhat
[15:54:17] <dabear> so if( eve.which == 1 && (event.altKey || event.ctrlKey |....)
[15:55:04] <Joe``````> that's true, that's a safer bet
[15:55:45] <dabear> if( event.which == 1 && !(event.altKey || event.ctrlKey || event.metaKey || event.shiftKey){ /* is left click and no modifier pressed*/}
[15:56:11] <dabear> bha, fix any errors and apply
[16:25:39] <Norwack> hey
[16:25:45] <Norwack> is it anything wrong with this code? http://pastebin.com/z9VgD9ry
[16:34:32] <amd123> hello, can any1 help me with my code in java, i got date to work as in todays date by using java.util.date and declaring as : licenceRenewal = new Date() which sets todays date but how do i increase the year by 1?
[16:36:54] <Norwack> amd123: Are you fucking stupid? jquery got nothing to do with java, nor does javascript
[16:37:33] <snover> Norwack: be nice.

[16:44:02] <troubleman> *AIRHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORN*
[16:44:11] <troubleman> At http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal - how does one exit the modal window by clicking anywhere outside it? I think that's more usable than having to aim for the X icon, don't y'all reckon?
[16:45:35] <Eviltwin> troubleman: Gotta stop doing that
[16:45:39] <dabear> troubleman: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/
[16:45:39] <fatninja> I have a 'button' that has more classes for example button and button_blue , I have a selector for class button, how do I extract button_blue from that element ?
[16:46:09] <Eviltwin> Extract it?
[16:46:21] <fatninja> get it
[16:46:25] <dabear> fatninja: this.className.split(/\s+/)
[16:46:36] <dabear> oh, hm
[16:46:43] <dabear> removeClass()?
[16:46:46] <whoever> how would i set  a combobox onload to blank, even though that is not one of the options for the combobox
[16:46:48] <dabear> I might have misunderstood
[16:46:54] <Eviltwin> Noldorin: Are you looking for .slideToggle()?
[16:47:16] <Eviltwin> Err
[16:47:21] <Eviltwin> He left
[16:47:35] <fatninja> for example, I have a standard css for the button, and I have more buttons with different background colors, every button has 'button' class and another class for the color
[16:47:52] <Eviltwin> fatninja: And you're trying to get that other color class?
[16:47:57] <fatninja> yes
[16:48:13] <troubleman> Eviltwin: doing what?
[16:48:14] <Eviltwin> While you can access .className or .attr("class")
[16:48:19] <Eviltwin> And split it up
[16:48:23] <Eviltwin> And find the class you're looking for
[16:48:25] <troubleman> dabear: unfortunately it's gotta be jquery ui dialog
[16:48:27] <Eviltwin> And it works just fine
[16:48:28] <troubleman> nice find though
[16:48:33] <fatninja> that was my idea
[16:48:33] <fatninja> but
[16:48:38] <fatninja> that splitting thing
[16:48:39] <Eviltwin> It's kind of abusing the attribute
[16:48:47] <Eviltwin> There's a .hasClass
[16:48:51] <troubleman> dabear: oh i see, cool
[16:49:09] <Eviltwin> troubleman: Stop the airhorn thing, it's just annoying
[16:49:12] <fatninja> yes I'm on the css category on query I know the functions , but I want to make like a global hover function
[16:49:28] <Eviltwin> fatninja: That does what?
[16:50:16] <fatninja> look: I have this element with classes 'button b_blue' , on mouseover I want it to remove class b_blue and switch it with 'b_blue_on'
[16:50:32] <fatninja> and on mouse out, remove b_blue_on bla bla
[16:50:56] <fatninja> let me look into 'splicing' and things I'll come back if I don't succeed
[16:51:05] <dabear> fatninja: use .hover, removeClass and .addClass
[16:51:21] <fatninja> dab ear : I don't know what class !
[16:51:21] <Matiasu> Hi!
[16:51:21] <dabear> no need to splice anything
[16:51:41] <fatninja> it can be b_blue , b_orange, b_whatever
[16:51:45] <dabear> you wanna remove a class you don't know the name of?
[16:51:47] <dabear> heh
[16:51:48] <dabear> ok
[16:52:04] <fatninja> I can find the name of it , I'm sure regex is around here in jquery
[16:52:09] <Eviltwin> fatninja: Why not "button b_blue on"
[16:52:15] <Eviltwin> And "button b_blue"
[16:52:19] <Eviltwin> Or "button b_blue off"
[16:52:30] <opie_> fatninja: evil's right
[16:52:42] <Matiasu> From time to time I add new content to the page dynamically. do I need to run $('a').click(function.....); every time? it seems it doesn't work for any <a> added in that way. isn't there a way to add a function for any <a> element?
[16:52:44] <Eviltwin> You can have CSS like .b_blue.on { ... } if needd
[16:52:47] <opie_> then you can just use $.toggle()
[16:52:48] <Eviltwin> needed*
[16:52:57] <opie_> and you can define hover for everything, and do the lifting in your css
[16:53:20] <Matiasu> I mean, I don't want to attach a click handler every time I add content
[16:53:34] <fatninja> Eviltwin: but of course… what an awesome idea, to be honest I thought of doing a transparent white .png with the class on to simulate the changing in color but your idea is much better :D
[16:53:56] <qom2> I want something to happen when a div gets a certain class, what should I be working with then?
[16:54:24] <Eviltwin> Matiasu: Look at .delegate
[16:54:29] <Eviltwin> ?.delegate @ Matiasu
[16:54:36] <Eviltwin> Bah, bot's still not back
[16:54:41] <Matiasu> don't worry
[16:54:47] <Matiasu> I will check .delegate, thank you!
[16:54:51] <troubleman> Eviltwin: oh the airhorn thing
[16:55:05] <troubleman> well i actually produce real airhorns
[16:55:08] <troubleman> hold up lemme show you
[16:55:27] <Eviltwin> troubleman: If you send me a case of airhorns for free, I'll let you keep doing it
[16:56:05] <stakhanov> Matiasu: try .on() if you're on 1.7
[16:56:18] <Matiasu> delegate seems to be exactly what I want
[16:56:23] <Matiasu> lets see .on
[16:56:29] <Eviltwin> Matiasu, stakhanov: Yes, but last I checked the behavior was better described on the .delegate page
[16:56:44] <Eviltwin> Matiasu: .on now does everything .bind, .live, and .delegate used to do
[16:56:54] <cornfeed> if i wanted to get the number from a string, what would be the best way? i know i could use trim() but I am not sure if it will be double digit. var inc = $(this).attr('id')  id='page-1' and i just want the digits
[16:56:54] <Eviltwin> In fact all three just call .on with the right params
[16:57:12] <Eviltwin> cornfeed: parseInt()?
[16:57:22] <troubleman> Eviltwin: hehe
[16:57:25] <cornfeed> thanks
[16:57:32] <Matiasu> I see, then .delegate! thanks both
[16:57:35] <troubleman> Eviltwin: they are synthesized digitally
[16:58:03] <troubleman> Eviltwin: using a saw wave http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawtooth_wave
[16:58:08] <troubleman> well mine is anyhow
[16:58:50] <Eviltwin> I know what a saw wave is :P
[16:59:41] <troubleman> Eviltwin: http://home.no/dwaynie/airhorn_for_eviltwin.mp3
[16:59:55] <troubleman> instead of the case though i could provide you with my preset
[17:00:07] <troubleman> which is somewhat of a trade secret :D
[17:01:02] <stakhanov> cornfeed, Eviltwin: Are you sure parseInt does the job? I think regular expressions are the case here...
[17:01:20] <qom2> Hm, so I have a div that changes class depending on certain conditions, sometimes it has the class "disabled" sometimes it doesn't (depends on content). How can I check when the div get the class "disabled" and run a fadeOut on that div?
[17:01:41] <Eviltwin> cornfeed: Do you want to keep leading zeros?
[17:02:04] <troubleman> Eviltwin: http://www.ableton.com/operator
[17:02:32] <Eviltwin> Nice
[17:05:45] <Matiasu> ahm, the behavior of .css has changed in v1.7, in old releases .css('foo', null) removes "foo" from the style attribute. now it doesn't do anything at all!
[17:06:03] <Sna4x8> Frustrating problem. http://jsfiddle.net/CnMqa/1/  Super simple snippet - doesn't work in IE7/8/9.  FF3/8/9 work, Chrome works.
[17:06:13] <Eviltwin> Don't use .live
[17:06:46] <Sna4x8> Eviltwin: I have to.  It's on a modal window.  And besides, the focus event fires fine in IE.
[17:06:46] <Matiasu> (by the way, .delegate is what I was looking for, this is another problem)
[17:06:57] <Eviltwin> Sna4x8: Look at .delegate
[17:07:06] <Sna4x8> Eviltwin: The password box just doesn't get focus.  Ok I will have a look.
[17:07:22] <Matiasu> how do you remove an CSS property in case you want to apply the default style? .css("foo", null) doesn't seem to work anymore
[17:07:25] <Eviltwin> Sna4x8: Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/CnMqa/2/
[17:07:32] <Eviltwin> Matiasu: ""
[17:07:39] <Eviltwin> Instead of null
[17:08:24] <Sna4x8> Eviltwin: Yea, I have that currently in other places.  It makes the display flash though, and seems kind of hackish to me.
[17:08:47] <Matiasu> agh, the answer was pretty obvious, I'm sorry :P
[17:09:15] <Sna4x8> Is it just something I should deal with for IE?  i.e. show().focus(); seems bugged in IE, so always wrap it in a timeout?
[17:09:17] <Eviltwin> Sna4x8: Which is worse display flash or it not working at all? :P
[17:09:32] <Eviltwin> It's buggy in many browsers
[17:09:34] <Sna4x8> lol, yea.  I have seen a lot of posts with the timeout thing.
[17:09:39] <Eviltwin> focusing something immediately after showing it
[17:09:45] <Eviltwin> Anyway, gotta go
[17:09:45] <Eviltwin> TTYL
[17:10:06] <Sna4x8> Ok, thanks.
[17:18:52] <JohnLe> Ran into a layout problem where chrome is one pixel off when aligning two divs
[17:19:29] <JohnLe> In FF $src.offset().left returns 116.35 where chrome returns 117
[17:20:24] <JohnLe> Any suggestions on the best way to work around the quirk?
[17:21:22] <whoever> is it posible to set a combobox to " " on load , even though that is not an option? or do i have to create a blank option?
[17:28:08] <fatninja> I have a link that opens a fancy box, but that link has a special attribute , I've looked into fancy box api, and I found onStart : function() , but I can't seem to figure out how to get (that element that was clicked)'s attributes
[17:28:58] <fatninja> $(this).attr('href')  in the onStart function is undefined
[17:30:43] <whoever> is not = still != or is it different in jquery ?
[17:32:33] <bowen199> my jquery cycle pluggig has huge gaps between showing the picture (drupal 7)
[17:32:36] <bowen199> any ideas?
[17:33:18] <bowen199> plugin*
[17:36:00] <JohnLe> whoever: != is correct... even with jQuery loaded, you're still in javascript
[17:38:06] <JohnLe> whoever: You should be able to set selectedIndex to -1 to clear
[17:41:18] <Cine> Hi, I'm trying to determine whether a element has another element inside it. The trouble is, having if($(id + " #body:not(:has(input))")) { isn't working as it doesn't return a boolean. Any ideas?
[17:42:08] <Eviltwin> Cine: One solution is to check if element has another element inside is to do $(elem).children().length > 0
[17:42:41] <Cine> ah awesome, thanks
[18:23:45] <Cine> is there any reason why an element wouldn't trigger a click handler, just after the elements class has been changed?
[18:25:58] <whoever> JohnLe: .val(-1) doesn't clear
[18:31:47] <troubleman> At http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#modal - how does one exit the modal window by clicking anywhere outside it?
[18:32:04] <troubleman> Just want to confirm - is http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/ the best way to do it?
[18:33:17] <Eviltwin> Probably
[18:39:42] <troubleman> thanks Eviltwin
[18:51:36] <AngryAsian> well all modal boxes usually have a div that basically takes up enough space to cover teh whole screen
[18:51:51] <AngryAsian> you can bind a click event to that to close the modal box
[18:53:12] <whoever> JohnLe: there dosn't seem to be a way in jqyery to blank  out a combobox in jqury if i try to set .text() or .val() to " " i end up with one of the values that I want in the list  being "" so if i want to do it all in jqyery i have to set a ""value and then onclick remove that value, seems like a round about way to do it, but seem odd that jqyery can't do it
[18:54:36] <AngryAsian> use a checkbox instead of a radio button?
[18:56:08] <AngryAsian> wait you mean <select><option></option></select> don't you?
[18:56:16] <solidus-river> i have a question concerning why a string bieng passed to append is not bieng rendered as html
[18:56:39] <solidus-river> it seems to be getting rendered as text
[18:56:41] <solidus-river> which sucks
[18:56:57] <AngryAsian> you ned to use .html() for that I believe.  Otherwise it puts in html chracter codes for things.
[18:57:27] <solidus-river> this is the string http://www.pastie.org/private/7gq8qruzzv2m0ddnhx8mta
[18:57:40] <solidus-river> i'm using things like &lt;
[18:57:44] <solidus-river> i think thats why
[18:57:55] <solidus-river> hmmm
[18:57:56] <AngryAsian> yes
[18:57:59] <AngryAsian> so first undo that
[18:58:01] <AngryAsian> then append
[18:58:09] <solidus-river> yeah, sorry, just jumped out at me when i pastie'd it
[18:58:12] <AngryAsian> :P
[18:59:04] <AngryAsian> if stuff doesnt display the way you like.  its usually things being converted to character codes or that you arent using utf-8 or the appropriate charset
[19:07:43] <Cine> why doesn't this work? http://jsfiddle.net/CA6aQ/
[19:21:38] <whoever> JohnLe: selectedindex still sets the combobox to what would be 0 when settin to -1
[19:21:46] <whoever>  $('#soft_opt option')[-1].selected = true;
[19:24:00] <solidus-river> lets say i have a string that is a lot of <li></li> that i want to append to a <ul>
[19:24:03] <JohnLe> Cine: Because no '.herro' class exists when the statement originally runs
[19:24:13] <solidus-river> i cant use .append because its more than one <li> block, right?
[19:24:16] <solidus-river> is there a funciton i can use?
[19:24:38] <Cine> JohnLe: ah i see
[19:24:45] <Cine> so i'd have to do something like: $('body').on('click', '.herro', function(e) {   ?
[19:25:10] <JohnLe> Cine: http://jsfiddle.net/CA6aQ/8/
[19:25:15] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/KnSS3/1/ - why won't the modal window load up in the same way as if I were to run it locally?
[19:25:17] <versatiletech> Cine: yep
[19:25:18] <troubleman> Anyway, at that site, how do I use http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/ to exit the modal window by clicking anywhere outside it?
[19:25:22] <troubleman> I loaded the script as a resource but since jsFiddle won't work in the first place I'm kinda stuck!
[19:25:38] <Cine> ah awesome. thanks
[19:33:04] <JohnLe> solidus-river: Why can't you append?
[19:33:23] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/KnSS3/2/ (using jQuery UI Dialog) - can someone help me with my syntax - I just need to exit the modal window when clicking outside it and I got http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/ all locked and loaded.
[19:33:52] <JohnLe> solidus-river: or better question, why doesn't this approach work? http://jsfiddle.net/CA6aQ/11/
[19:34:37] <solidus-river> JohnLe: yeah thanks! for some reason i thought append needed to be enclosed in a block element, such as append one li at a time etc
[19:34:44] <solidus-river> JohnLe: that fixes a lot of my issues
[19:36:59] * troubleman sends his sister to lure JohnLe to help him
[19:46:36] <JohnLe> whoever: Sorry, didn't follow
[19:48:01] <troubleman> JohnLe: here goes:
[19:48:05] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/KnSS3/2/ (using jQuery UI Dialog) - can someone help me with my syntax - I just need to exit the modal window when clicking outside it and I got http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-outside-events-plugin/ all locked and loaded.
[19:50:37] <k1t> heya
[19:50:40] <k1t> =P
[19:50:53] <JohnLe> troubleman: what implements that dialog function? jquery?
[19:51:10] <troubleman> JohnLe: yes sir!
[19:51:55] <JohnLe> the jsfiddler session doesn't work for me, do you expect it to?
[19:52:59] <troubleman> doesnt work for me either, jsfiddle is messed up
[19:53:15] <troubleman> well, im trying to transfer the commented part of the JS over to the non-commented part
[19:53:27] <troubleman> but my knowledge of JS syntaxes is limited so I was hoping you could help
[19:53:50] <JohnLe> ok
[19:54:01] <JohnLe> I don't use jquery ui much
[19:54:21] <JohnLe> are you sure it doesn't natively support the 'click outside to close' behavior?
[19:56:17] <troubleman> JohnLe: pretty much yeah
[19:56:19] <JohnLe> troubleman: what about something like this? http://www.ryanjeffords.com/blog/entry/closing-a-jquery-ui-dialog-when-the-dialog-loses-focus
[19:56:33] <JohnLe> It looks like it creates an overlay element
[19:56:44] <JohnLe> and you can just register a click event for that element
[19:56:50] <JohnLe> that closes
[19:57:02] <troubleman> JohnLe: that is amazing man!!
[19:57:05] <troubleman> i had no idea..
[19:57:27] <troubleman> any idea how that code would look though?
[19:57:46] <troubleman> all i know is i styled my overlay element like this: .ui-widget-overlay { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; background: #fff; opacity: 0.6; }
[19:58:04] <troubleman> thats where my skills end though hehe
[19:58:07] <troubleman> (and yours continue)
[19:59:36] <JohnLe> troubleman: The code on that linked article looks about right
[19:59:47] <JohnLe> I might use .on instead of .live
[20:00:56] <JohnLe> but basically $(document).on('click', '.ui-widget-overlay', function(){ $('#yourdialogid').dialog('close') });
[20:01:06] <JohnLe> or similar
[20:01:29] <troubleman> JohnLe: this look about right? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/KnSS3/3/
[20:01:41] <JohnLe> register click handler for the widget overlay, and call close on the element which the dialog was register to
[20:01:44] <troubleman> http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/KnSS3/4/ i mean
[20:03:29] <JohnLe> I'd think something closer to http://jsfiddle.net/KnSS3/5/
[20:03:32] <JohnLe> gotta bail
[20:03:46] <JohnLe> good luck
[20:04:19] <troubleman> later JohnLe
[20:04:22] <troubleman> thanks a lot man

[20:56:48] <LukeNukem> how to make an alert mobx in jquery
[21:06:40] <voidvector> you can still use javascript alert()
[21:08:04] <voidvector> but you prolly want to use something like jQuery UI or other plugins to create more user friendly ones
[21:10:44] <LukeNukem> voidvector, i want to give it a font color and stuff
[21:10:47] <LukeNukem> so how would i be doing that?
[21:11:02] <tapmodo> CSS
[21:11:15] <voidvector> which one are you using?
[21:11:19] <LukeNukem> yeah but how would i create the alert box ^_^
[21:11:22] <LukeNukem> jquery?
[21:11:35] <LukeNukem> 1.7.1
[21:13:27] <tapmodo> most of them are CSS-based... look at jquery-ui "dialog"... at worst you could include inline-css in the content to style... ideally use themeroller if you want to style the overall look
[21:15:41] <LukeNukem> tapmodo, isn't ther esomething in jquery itself?
[21:19:28] <LukeNukem> cmon u guys help me out here, totally new
[21:19:56] <georgeps> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/
[21:20:59] <georgeps> Not a big jquery-ui user, but I believe it'll dynamically make the markup for you. You can either style yourself in CSS or use ThemeRoller to generate some stylesheets.
[21:21:22] <LukeNukem> how do i make an alert box?
[21:21:25] <LukeNukem> like jalert?
[21:21:26] <LukeNukem> or what
[21:21:42] <georgeps> an alert box, like a system alert?
[21:22:00] <LukeNukem> like in alert('')
[21:23:01] <georgeps> that's a browser thing... you can only give those things text to output. If you want to style it you'd have to do something custom with html/css.
[21:23:15] <georgeps> Or use something like jquery-ui dialog
[21:24:17] <georgeps> And they're not really the same thing, if I'm not being clear... alert() is a software alert for the browser itself, as opposed to a website alert.
[21:34:21] <Platehead> YOU COME TO PEACE.IGNORELIST.COM 6667 OR NZCHATTER.NET FOR A GOOD CHAT ;]
[21:38:55] <ernie_> if i open a new window, and then set up jquery on the new page by appending a script, how would I go about accessing that other page's jquery object?
[21:44:55] <georgeps> var x = window.open('http://www.someurl.com/somepage');
[21:45:02] <georgeps> x.$();
[23:12:44] <oojacoboo> question with timezones and php
[23:13:08] <oojacoboo> php uses things like America/New_York for it's timezone values
[23:13:24] <oojacoboo> does javascript/jquery have a timezone function built in?
[23:13:45] <ernie_> question for ya: I'm creating a page with open().document, and appending jquery to the head.  Then if I append a script whose src is wrapped in $(document).ready, that second script will never run.  However, if I do a raw alert() first, then the document ready script will work!  what could be causing that?  maybe jquery's not loaded by the time I hit the document.ready?
[23:13:46] <oojacoboo> I'm seeing the var timezone in our code, but I don't know if that originates from elsewhere
[23:14:45] <oojacoboo> nm, I found it :P
[23:16:39] <BrotherRodriguez> ernie, is the second js file being generated dynamically? If not, just include it and then make the function calls from $(function() { }
[23:18:18] <ernie_> the 2nd js is provided as source.  so I load jquery with src=~.js, then the 2nd one I set it's innerHTML to be some stuff starting with $(document).ready
[23:19:15] <ernie_> hmm, just did a test and typeof(jQuery) is not defined when the 2nd one is trying to start using $(document).ready, which could be a problem
[23:20:09] <BrotherRodriguez> I'm not sure I understand your setup, do you have a jsfiddle?
[23:20:28] <BrotherRodriguez> but yeah, jQuery not being defined at the moment would cause problems
[23:24:51] <ernie_> http://jsfiddle.net/3fXfa/
[23:25:30] <ernie_> the latter function fails.  I'm thinking of trying something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4881289/load-jquery-script-after-javascript-script-has-finished  which basically just waits til jQuery is defined before executing the function instead of using document.ready
[23:28:48] <snimavat> is there any selector tht lets me find elements with id specified in given list
[23:29:06] <snimavat> i have list of ids (array) and i want to find all elements
[23:35:46] <BrotherRodriguez> snimavat: see .filter()
[23:36:17] <BrotherRodriguez> ernie_ why are you putting the $(document).ready() in the innerHTML? why not just in the <head> of your page?
[23:36:51] <ernie_> I put it into the innerHTML of the script I was adding to the head, right?
[23:36:58] <ernie_> hmm that wait thingie works, it's all good now =)
[23:38:06] <BrotherRodriguez> ok
[23:38:44] <ernie_> I guess because of the way I was constructing the 2nd page, things didn't work as normal.
[23:48:35] <geoid> greetz
[23:48:57] <geoid> what's that special .command to bring the context back to the previous element?
[23:49:41] <geoid> so $('#myfield).val(value).attr('validate',valid).addClass('myclass')
[23:49:57] <geoid> this breaks... I'm missing something to change the context of addClass back to the selected field
[23:50:24] <geoid> is it .stop()?? can't remember and can't find it on google.
[23:53:35] <joyce_> Why isn't this code working? var $el = $('#test'); $el.click($.proxy($el, 'remove'));
[23:53:49] <joyce_> I'm getting the error message c.replace is not a function
[23:57:22] <BrotherRodriguez> bot-t kik @ joyce_
[23:58:39] <joyce_> BrotherRodriguez: I'm not sure what that means.
[23:58:51] <BrotherRodriguez> sorry, I was trying to do a command to the bot
[23:58:55] <joyce_> :)
[23:59:06] <BrotherRodriguez> you should mock up an example in jsfiddle so that we can see your actual sorce
[23:59:14] <BrotherRodriguez> *source. The example is too vague.
