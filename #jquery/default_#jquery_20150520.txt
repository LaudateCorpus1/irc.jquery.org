[00:04:19] <xec> ISmithers: i don't see anthing wrong immediately, but i don't know much about whatever that .rules() is
[00:04:32] <xec> ISmithers: i'm guessing it's this http://jqueryvalidation.org/require_from_group-method
[00:06:40] <ISmithers> Yeah that is the one.
[00:06:53] <ISmithers> I just started learning about it today, on an existing and arguably complicated codebase.
[00:08:28] <ISmithers> I have no errors, I can see the page source and it looks as one would expect given the documentation and yet it absolutely does nothing. Which is very sad.
[00:09:34] <xec> ISmithers: what does the corresponding html look like?
[00:11:43] <ISmithers> http://pastie.org/10198047 Essentially a bunch of checkboxes like this.
[00:13:51] <ISmithers> Its OK will figure out when I get home. Annoying stuff this.
[00:13:53] <ISmithers> Thanks anyhow o/
[00:17:00] <PCatinean> If I want to call a ajax script that is relative of the page from where it is being called, how do I do that?
[00:17:09] <PCatinean> I goes for absolute even though I ommited '/' in the path
[00:18:01] <Cork> PCatinean: without the / it should be relative to the .html file it is loaded into
[00:18:11] <Cork> it won't ever be relative to the scripts location
[00:22:01] <PCatinean> so I am at /page/x/y and I call the script that points to 'z' and it calls /page/z instead of /page/x/y/z
[00:23:07] <Cork> PCatinean: your at /page/x/y or /page/x/y/ ?
[00:23:19] <Cork> that if the former, what you get is expected
[00:23:51] <PCatinean> /page/x/y
[00:24:11] <Cork> ok then: /page/x/ is the path and y is seen as the "file"
[00:24:26] <Cork> so z is considered to be a sibling of y
[00:24:31] <Cork> so you get /page/x/z
[00:24:55] <Cork> oh wait... you don't
[00:25:11] <tx> Hey guys, ok to talk about JQuery-UI here too?
[00:25:12] <Cork> /page/z shouldn't happen
[00:25:27] <Cork> tx: there wouldn't be a place to if not here
[00:25:37] <Cork> (check the topic)
[00:25:48] <tx> Eyy. Is there a way to get a modal dialog to only show an overlay on a specific div?
[00:25:54] <tx> (and not the entire page)
[00:26:10] <Cork> sure, set the div as container
[00:26:18] <Cork> and have the div as overflow: hidden
[00:26:54] <Cork> http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#option-appendTo
[00:27:04] <Cork> it's apparently called appendTo in dialog
[00:38:45] <PCatinean> Cork, what if I do: window.location.pathname ?
[00:38:53] <DERIIIFranz> how to check whether an jquery-element is an ancestor of another jquery-element?
[00:39:13] <Cork> PCatinean: if you mean if you do location.pathname + 'z' sure
[00:39:23] <Cork> or rather
[00:39:25] <PCatinean> yep
[00:39:26] <DERIIIFranz> .contains() doesn't take jquery-objects as arguments
[00:39:29] <Cork> PCatinean: location.pathname + '/z' sure
[00:39:36] <PCatinean> yes that :D
[00:39:38] <PCatinean> cool
[00:39:42] <Cork> DERIIIFranz: .contains is a gigantic hack
[00:39:58] <Cork> it serializes the subtree to html and makes a text search in it
[00:40:08] <DERIIIFranz> Cork: so is there a proper way of doing so?
[00:40:11] <Cork> you should try to avoid it
[00:40:30] <Cork> DERIIIFranz: you would have to show what you're trying to do
[00:40:38] <Cork> a jsfiddle is prob the best place
[00:41:48] <bigmac> how do i incorperate boot strap grid with responsive image with this cycle gallery
[00:41:50] <bigmac> http://jsfiddle.net/fvAyS/63/
[00:42:10] <DERIIIFranz> Cork: all I need to do is, to check, whether the element a user clicked on is a child of a specific element
[00:42:49] <Cork> DERIIIFranz: $(this).closest('target').length > 0
[00:43:09] <Cork> where target is the parent you want to check for
[00:43:28] <Cork> (and yes it can be a jquery or dom element instead of a string)
[00:44:57] <DERIIIFranz> seems promising
[00:53:42] <pauled> on this page http://en.lichess.org/tv I have an userscript that do $(".username.on-game.white").prepend("<span class='player color-icon is white'>&nbsp;</span>");
[00:54:10] <pauled> it work if I manually refresh the page, but not if it's automatically refreshed
[00:54:47] <Cork> are you sure the page is actually refreshed and not just ajax updated?
[00:55:24] <pauled> I don't know, probably ajax updated
[00:55:40] <Cork> and there you have why the script you have doesn't work
[00:56:02] <Cork> you have to see if you can hook into the script updating the page
[00:56:15] <vinex08> hi, do you guys know a snippet/codes that 'does reverse countdown and when the clock reaches 0, it will show content'
[00:56:34] <Cork> vinex08: tried google?
[00:56:36] <vinex08> maybe something similar to that then i can work from there
[00:56:54] <vinex08> Cork: i prefer your suggestions
[00:57:27] <pauled> vinex08: http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/4mrmLwy0/4/
[00:58:09] <pauled> vinex08: http://fiddle.jshell.net/mawekuwe/yupnwtrm/
[01:00:07] <vinex08> second is perfect! thanks!
[01:03:02] <DERIIIFranz> Cork: works like a charm, thx!
[01:03:13] <Cork> DERIIIFranz: yw
[01:04:28] <pauled> Cork: tried with MutationObserver http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/5c95jzpa/
[01:05:20] <pauled> and it doesn't work at all
[01:05:34] <pauled> even if I manually refresh
[01:06:16] <Cork> pauled: mutation observers isn't called on page load
[01:06:37] <SuperTyp> I use jquery ajax function and send the data to my php script, where I throw exceptions if failed or return true if succeeded, when I then log the "result" the data is undefined...whats wrong? http://pastie.org/10198110
[01:06:41] <Cork> pauled: for later make sure the element you observe isn't replaced
[01:07:25] <Cork> SuperTyp: .fail doesn't have that profile
[01:07:39] <Cork> it doesn't provide a data argument
[01:07:49] <SuperTyp> oh and .done?
[01:08:23] <bigmac> can some one check out this example of a responsive image that does not work when i apply the gallery cycle
[01:08:25] <bigmac> http://jsfiddle.net/fvAyS/64/
[01:08:28] <pauled> how I can call on page load? hmm replaced? the element I observe is supposed to be updated after every game finished or page auto reloaded
[01:08:45] <Cork> SuperTyp: done is only called on 200 responses
[01:09:15] <Cork> SuperTyp: also you don't return things to a http response
[01:09:22] <Cork> SuperTyp: you echo what you want to send to the other end
[01:10:00] <SuperTyp> Cork: thats what I actually do, firebug even shows me the exception, but how do I now handle it with jquery?
[01:10:25] <Cork> SuperTyp: 5xx responses end up in .fail
[01:10:33] <SuperTyp> in php: echo json_encode(array(//the exception as array))
[01:10:36] <Cork> but your profile for .fail is wrong
[01:11:05] <Cork> SuperTyp: also don't forget to set the correct content-type in the php script (though that doesn't matter for the exception situation)
[01:11:59] <SuperTyp> yes header content type appl/json, I know :)
[01:12:43] <Cork> ah, so the exception is still returned as a 2xx response?
[01:12:54] <Cork> well then you should have the content in data in the done response
[01:12:55] <SuperTyp> I am checking it right now
[01:13:39] <pauled> bigmac: you can use bootstrap directly from jsfiddle js+css http://jsfiddle.net/mawekuwe/fvAyS/65/
[01:15:19] <_bt_> hi i'm trying to upload a file by ajax+jquery and i'm having trouble - what appears to happen is that "[object FormData]" is sent as a string in the query
[01:16:11] <_bt_> the javascript is here: http://pastebin.com/VLhLs9gN
[01:16:58] <SuperTyp> Cork: neither .done() nor .fail() fire an alert...
[01:17:31] <_bt_> anyone got any idea why that is failing?
[01:20:27] <SuperTyp> Cork: http://pastie.org/10198125 is the client side correct now?
[01:20:43] <SuperTyp> _bt_: what is FormData obj doing with the form data?
[01:24:40] <_bt_> SuperTyp: i'm not sure
[01:25:29] <_bt_> i've just inspected the object and it appears not to contain anything
[01:25:38] <SuperTyp_> so why do you create it then?
[01:25:52] <SuperTyp_> be right back
[01:27:01] <SuperTyp> back
[01:42:26] <SuperTyp> Cork: I get a 200 OK...but the .done function doesn't fire :(
[01:42:51] <Cork> SuperTyp: correct the .fail function and check the third argument
[01:43:14] <Cork> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[01:43:28] <Cork> check the error property description
[01:45:00] <SuperTyp> Cork: got it...
[01:45:03] <SuperTyp> so stupid
[01:45:52] <SuperTyp> I have edited the wrong file the whole time, after I moved the js file to the js directory...that happens if you are too used to windows
[01:45:56] <geox2> Anyone, knows how google put a "cookie usage notification box" at bottom of page with a button like "Got It" i mean i know how to do it but i don't know how they do "hide the accept cookie" so i don't see it inside the debugger.
[01:46:42] <Cork> uh, see it inside the debugger?
[01:46:47] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[01:49:19] <geox2> Cork hard to explain but i tought they will have a cookie like "NotYetClicked" so they show allways the cookie notification usage at bottom once you click "got it" it dissapears for the next "cache clear" yea but they have no cookie for that .. so how they do it
[01:49:42] <Cork> geox2: no they aren't allowed to do that
[01:49:50] <Cork> they set a cookie when you have accepted it
[01:50:07] <Cork> by definition they can't set a cookie before you accept to store cookies :)
[01:50:32] <Cork> but they use there compact bitmap cookie
[01:50:50] <geox2> Cork, hmm it sounds like a kind of warn to me also the name "got it" does not sounds like "Agree" or "disagree" to me
[01:51:17] <Cork> geox2: but the europeian law that requires them to show that banner is
[01:51:27] <geox2> Cork i just wonder how they know you didnt clicked it already, without the use of cookies
[01:51:44] <Cork> geox2: cookie now set == show banner
[01:51:49] <Cork> geox2: cookie set = don't show it
[01:52:03] <Cork> so the first stage is always true until the cookie is set
[01:55:02] <geox2> Cork ah yea should be true, but i wonder too cuz when i click "got it" it dissapears but also no new cookie is added into the debugger so they must remove it or somehow hide it from the debugger
[01:55:58] <geox2> Cork i go clear my cache and try it again after i press "got it" if there will be added some new cookie but as i remember nothing was added or dissmissed
[01:56:22] <Cork> geox2: remember they store cookies on a lot of different domains
[01:56:32] <Cork> i think this one is stored on accounts.google.com or www.google.com
[01:56:35] <Cork> but not completely sure
[01:56:55] <Cork> and also look for changed cookies
[01:57:02] <Cork> not just new ones
[01:58:02] <geox2> Cork ah ok gona try to search it. thanks
[01:58:11] <Tennis> morning o/
[01:58:15] <Tennis> :)
[02:03:03] <toomus> Hi. How to disable form submit with enter? And why if I set submit button as disabled, form still can be submited with enter?
[02:03:32] <Cork> toomus: no it shouldn't be submitted on enter if the button is disabled
[02:04:09] <DarsVaeda> can I trigger something so a draggable connected to a sortable will be reverted without firing the update event of the sortable?
[02:04:19] <toomus> I have disabled='disabled'
[02:04:57] <Cork> toomus: http://jsfiddle.net/ygm7ddpL/
[02:04:58] <Cork> wfm
[02:06:04] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/ygm7ddpL/1/ fix for broken jquery-git lib
[02:07:04] <toomus> Cork: ohhhhh I realize what I have done wrong. This form is a realtime search field. It is submiting on every keyup event, so also on enter! I probably need to filter which key is pressed?
[02:07:34] <Cork> toomus: no you should use input instead of keydown
[02:07:42] <Cork> *keyup
[02:08:09] <toomus> .on('input'....)?
[02:08:14] <Cork> yup
[02:08:33] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/input
[02:10:07] <toomus> Cork: THX, it works :)
[02:10:27] <Cork> input only register visible keypresses
[02:10:38] <Cork> and it also register paste changes
[02:10:55] <Cork> so it is a much better event to use
[02:11:50] <toomus> Cork: yes, you are right, input event is perfect for realtime search
[02:11:53] <dimi1947> cork do you remember the solution you proposed me earlier clos||[]
[02:12:03] <Cork> dimi1947: sure
[02:12:26] <dimi1947> well is does not work...let me axplain
[02:13:25] <Cork> dimi1947: also i suggested window.clos || [] not clos || []
[02:13:38] <Cork> (the later won't work)
[02:13:48] <dimi1947> give  me a second
[02:14:20] <Cork> also it is prob better to make a running jsfiddle with the problem
[02:14:31] <Cork> easier to correct to fix the problem if it is working code
[02:15:14] <dimi1947> then give me some more time to prepare afiddle too
[02:15:30] <Cork> also just write a simplified example
[02:15:36] <Cork> you don't need the ajax call for example
[02:15:42] <Cork> as the problem isn't related to that
[02:18:21] <PCatinean> Cork, the best way to do "split string by '_' and parseInt the second part, return False if len < 2
[02:18:22] <PCatinean> ?
[02:19:27] <DarsVaeda> can I trigger something so a draggable connected to a sortable will be reverted without firing the update event of the sortable? -> here is an example http://jsfiddle.net/adq6exkp/
[02:22:19] <SuperTyp> PCatinean: google
[02:22:24] <DarsVaeda> I want to limit the number of element you can drag to the sortable
[02:23:45] <DarsVaeda> problem is all the other events fire before the update so on the update event the element is already removed so the number of elements is small enough, I need to remove the element though because otherwise it will be visible in the sortable
[02:25:12] <PCatinean> Not sure if this is the most clean way that's all: http://hastebin.com/hucedenegi.js
[02:25:44] <Cork> PCatinean: how about parseInt('somethingn_'.split('_')[1])||0
[02:26:44] <PCatinean> Cork, what if there is no '_'?
[02:26:48] <PCatinean> I don't want it to error out then
[02:27:03] <PCatinean> ah of parseInt handles the error?
[02:27:13] <Cork> it isn't an error
[02:27:39] <Cork> 'somethingn'.split('_') == [ 'somethingn' ]
[02:27:50] <Cork> [ 'somethingn' ][1] == undefined
[02:28:00] <Cork> parseInt(undefined) == NaN
[02:28:03] <PCatinean> aahh cool
[02:28:05] <Cork> NaN || 0 == 0
[02:28:20] <PCatinean> so no need to explictitly check for the len
[02:30:14] <DarsVaeda> other sources recommend calling cancel on the sortable in the recieve event (see here line 42 http://jsfiddle.net/adq6exkp/1/ ) but that raises an error for me
[02:33:11] <xqo> hi
[02:33:15] <xqo> if (1===2 && "a" === "b") Will this statement ever check if "a" === "b", or will it have stopped before that?
[02:33:40] <Cork> xqo: if cases is tested from left to right
[02:33:56] <Cork> and and checks abort as soon as a check fails
[02:34:02] <xqo> thank you
[02:34:02] <Cork> *aborts
[02:34:52] <xqo> Cork do you have any opinions about ember?
[02:35:20] <Cork> never used it
[03:24:02] <mrtAkdeniz> hey there
[03:24:09] <mrtAkdeniz> what is wrong with that : https://jsfiddle.net/mrtakdeniz/kusp0dzc/
[03:27:09] <Cork> mrtAkdeniz: your giving data to an ajax key
[03:27:16] <Cork> i suspect that ajax expects an url
[03:27:28] <mrtAkdeniz> on my server, it fails different
[03:27:30] <Cork> (i've never used datatable)
[03:27:42] <mrtAkdeniz> i wanted to show it to you guys, so i pasted my json
[03:28:02] <Cork> look at the format datatable expects back
[03:28:09] <Cork> i suspect it wants an array not an object
[03:36:07] <suexec> Will .hasClass() iterate over all classes? i.e will it be true for <input id="test" class="test1 test2 test3"> if I do .hasClass("test3") ?
[03:36:22] <arc_> yes
[03:41:33] <xqo> Cork is this the best way to loop through every item in a {key:value} object? for (x in y){if (y.hasOwnProperty(x)) {var z = y[x];}} http://jsfiddle.net/su4b0ry9/
[03:41:50] <xqo> I ask because using 2 lines to start the loop every time is a little bleh
[03:42:03] <Cork> xqo: $.each(obj, function(key, val) {})
[03:42:17] <xqo> oh right, this is #jquery.
[03:42:45] <Cork> xqo: the alternative for pure js is Object.keys(obj).forEach(function() {})
[03:43:20] <xqo> ok, so either forEach, or the method i mentioned?
[03:43:52] <xqo> I dont love forEach because the loop will have its own scope. Thank you very much
[03:44:11] <Cork> xqo: ya, if you use for in you need to check the hasOwnProperty
[03:44:26] <xqo> thank you
[03:44:28] <Cork> xqo: the scope isn't really a big deal
[03:44:43] <xqo> it makes me have to do a var self = this; before the loop very often
[03:45:01] <Cork> you shouldn't use this that much then :)
[03:45:09] <xqo> hehe
[03:45:27] <Cork> es6 is largely making away with this
[03:45:58] <xqo> do you already decide to use ES6 when you start new projects?
[03:46:17] <Cork> no, as basically only gecko supports it so...
[03:46:30] <Cork> i use it a lot in extensions though
[03:46:56] <Cork> ie12 looks like it will have fairly nice support
[03:47:09] <xqo> by the end of the year, it will be es6 all the way, unless you need backwards compatibility?
[03:47:14] <Cork> but chrome has stopped developing for it much (they are pushing for dart instead)
[03:47:23] <Cork> and safari haven't even started as far as i know
[03:47:34] <Cork> xqo: heck no
[03:47:36] <xqo> wow, ok
[03:47:59] <xqo> my impression that it was almost ready to go, because people refer to ES6 references a lot already
[03:48:07] <Cork> i would guess at mozilla getting full support by say end of 2016-17
[03:48:11] <Cork> ie around 17-18
[03:48:18] <Cork> chrome possibly
[03:48:29] <Cork> safari? who knows if they will even bother
[03:48:53] <Cork> xqo: well it was more referring to harmony before
[03:49:01] <Uhkis> there's gonna be IE12 before that new one?
[03:49:24] <Cork> don't think so
[03:49:28] <Cork> but not fully sure
[03:49:32] <Cork> i don't use windows much
[03:49:40] <Cork> so can't really fiddle much with ie
[03:50:50] <Cork> i find it extremely silly that you need an ~8-10 gb vm for every version of ie you want to test...
[03:51:16] <Cork> while every other browser you just extract an archive in a folder and; done
[03:51:50] <suexec> I just looped through my objects classes using this, var classList = document.getElementById(node.id).className.split(/\s+/); . The element has the class I am looking for. In my check, I am doing this: if($(node).hasClass('notInstalled')) { .. } , and it's not hitting, even though I know it's there. What am I doing wrong ?
[03:52:54] <Cork> suexec: you would have to make an example of the problem
[04:04:36] <suexec> Cork, hard to do. using jstree and loads of other stuff that generates code
[04:05:04] <Cork> well it is close to impossible to say what goes wrong without seeing what the dom shows
[04:05:19] <suexec> Would .hasClass be significantly quicker than looping myself ?
[04:06:07] <Cork> suexec: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.fn.hasClass
[04:06:33] <Cork> so no, as it is exactly what it does
[04:07:32] <Cork> suexec: though note $(node) != document.getElementById(node.id)
[04:07:44] <Cork> suexec: does node.className give you the same result?
[04:08:01] <Cork> else you have why you get a different result
[04:08:30] <Cork> and $('#' + node.id).hasClass('notInstalled') would work in that case
[04:08:45] <suexec> node.className is undefined
[04:09:08] <Cork> so it isn't a dom element
[04:09:16] <Cork> and that would explain why things break
[04:11:09] <suexec> Thanks man - nailed it :)
[04:11:21] <suexec> var element = document.getElementById(node.id); followed by if($(element).hasClass('notInstalled')) {
[04:11:38] <Cork> uh why not just do that in one go?
[04:11:45] <Cork> $('#' + node.id).hasClass('notInstalled')
[04:13:54] <suexec> Doesn't seem to work, for some reason
[04:18:52] <Lebbe> huh
[04:18:58] <Bogdaniel> morning everyone i have a form with an upload field and i'm trying to submit it using ajax without page refresh but i always get in console the log error. http://pastebin.com/CxUGLRQB i don't have too much experience with javascript can you help me figure it out why it doesn't work ? :D
[04:19:08] <Lebbe> if($('#' + node.id).hasClass('notInstalled')) then
[04:56:53] <theDev> <div onclick="doSomething(2435);"></div>    how can i make prevenDefault on this one ???
[04:57:18] <theDev> function doSomething(i) { e.preventDefault(); } <-- doesn;t work
[04:57:40] <Uhkis> a) move the event handler away from the div
[04:58:21] <theDev> Uhkis: i need this inline
[04:59:11] <Uhkis> no you dont!
[05:24:55] <theDev> Uhkis: say you dont know.. the solution is to catch the window.event.preventDefault();. enjoy
[05:25:38] <samssh> theDev, You can probably also return false from the function.
[05:26:09] <samssh> Would you be willing to share why inline JS is required?
[05:28:26] <ismithers> Can I add multiple jquery validation rules at once? Like $(".some-class").each(function() { $(this).rules("add", <rule goes here>); }); ?
[05:28:29] <kevinhoekman> Hi i am heaving a problem with  draggable and droppable. I have 3 tables with scrollable rows. when i drop an item the item is dropped in the element beneath
[05:28:43] <kevinhoekman> these elements are in the overflow
[05:29:01] <kevinhoekman> i made an example and hope someone is able to help me with this :)
[05:29:02] <kevinhoekman> http://jsfiddle.net/cpmfLw0b/5/
[05:29:29] <ismithers> I'm checking the page source and it seems valid, no errors, but definitely doesn't catch my validation fails.
[05:30:29] <kevinhoekman> When you drag the image on the purple J2  for example. the console will log a drop on the yellow F4 and the purple J2
[05:34:30] <ccc_> ahoy
[05:50:35] <ismithers> https://db.tt/er9z3ARn I can get this thus far. The jquery code is coming from .NET so I can't seem to clear up the error labels.
[05:50:58] <ccc_> i using jquery to switch divs but it breaks if i switch from korean to chhinese http://jsfiddle.net/13tcollins/uz0fyhc7/
[05:52:31] <arc_> i'm having trouble understanding what this is actually supposed to do
[05:53:48] <ccc_> arc mine?
[05:53:50] <arc_> yes
[05:53:56] <arc_> why is there an english div and no flag representing it
[05:55:00] <ccc_> because its english by default check this out  http://vespermems.com/about
[05:56:23] <ccc_> if youre on korean and switch to chinese it breaks
[05:56:25] <arc_> users might want to switch back to english
[05:56:44] <arc_> if you're on chinese and switch to korean it also breaks
[05:56:46] <ccc_> i know it toggles it if you click it again
[05:57:12] <arc_> not rly, it just shows the english div while the other div is still there
[05:57:13] <ismithers> Any assistance appreciated: http://pastie.org/10198598
[05:58:28] <ismithers> Obviously when I say 'sort of works' it correctly fails validation, yet incorrectly displays a zillion error messages.
[05:59:05] <ccc_> so how do i fix that
[06:03:14] <PCatinean> How does one find the closest parent <form> ?
[06:03:17] <PCatinean> only parent
[06:03:42] <arc_> ccc_ http://jsfiddle.net/uz0fyhc7/1/
[06:05:25] <arc_> btw, i don't think it's obvious to click again to show english, but that's up to you
[06:07:07] <ccc_> Thank you arc that helped me soo much
[06:07:17] <arc_> np
[06:08:17] <PCatinean> how does one find the closest parent form (if any)
[06:08:18] <PCatinean> ?
[06:08:28] <PCatinean> because closest finds up and down as well
[06:08:44] <shoky> closest only goes up, starting with current element
[06:08:51] <arc_> isn't that just parent()
[06:09:24] <arc_> idk how any parent can be closer than the one parent() would return
[06:09:37] <shoky> probably doesn't mean direct parent
[06:09:56] <arc_> can you pass a filter as a parameter
[06:10:01] <ismithers> Anyone have experience with validation? https://db.tt/er9z3ARn
[06:10:02] <shoky> yea
[06:10:38] <arc_> so parent('form') i guess
[06:10:47] <shoky> .closest('form') sounds like what he needs
[06:10:52] <arc_> could be

[06:35:22] <SuperTyp> The DOM element is created but the popup doesn't show, is it because the DOM isn't really ready to display the popup the way I do it?

[06:44:47] <RedRat_> hi guys, is possible to set method name into variable?
[06:45:38] <decx> some browsers can do it
[06:49:08] <PCatinean> Jesus Christ I have a function called in a else and it's eing called twice I have no idea why
[06:49:09] <PCatinean> and how to debug it
[06:54:38] <SuperTyp> PCatinean: show code
[06:54:52] <PCatinean> too much to decode or make a jsfiddle
[06:54:55] <PCatinean> not enough to make context at least
[06:55:25] <PCatinean> actually it appears to call only once if I do console.log but it's called twice on the server-side
[06:55:58] <SuperTyp> RedRat_: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3733580/javascript-variable-in-function-name-possible
[06:56:58] <RedRat_> SuperTyp, thanks
[06:57:08] <RedRat_> I saw here that is possible with []
[06:57:39] <RedRat_> var x = 'attr'; $('element')[x]('name');

[07:05:19] <SuperTyp> (jquery mobile) I want to use popup for showing error to the user on form submit, this is what I did so far: http://pastie.org/10198722 the message is appended to the page, but no popup appears, any help?
[07:05:35] <xckpd7> is there a jquery plugin for responsive carousel but it chops off the left & right responsively?
[07:06:16] <xckpd7> so I basically have a long image and on resize I want the height to stay the same but the left & right parts of the image get hidden as you constrain the browser... but pressing right and left, I want it to go to the next "chopped off" image
[07:07:07] <BillCriswell> xckpd7: Background image?
[07:10:09] <xckpd7> BillCriswell: mmm yeah I could do that...forgot about that. thanks

[07:23:19] <Tennis> hey guiz
[07:23:27] <Tennis> .append() refuses to work :(
[07:23:32] <Tennis> but .html works every time
[07:23:45] <Tennis> but i don't want to overwrite i really do want to append
[07:25:34] <Tennis> sorry my mistake it is working but something else isn't
[07:33:33] <SuperTyp> I found my error, I missed a #
[07:33:49] <SuperTyp> Tennis: provide some code so we can help you
[07:34:17] <Tennis> thanks for offering to help
[07:34:25] <Tennis> but i realised it wasn't an issue with append()
[07:34:30] <Tennis> it was an issue with visisbility
[07:35:22] <SuperTyp> ok
[07:56:10] <dan2k3k4k5> when I do $('#someId').tabs(); it seems to make a call to the base URL and loads that within where the tab content should be o_0
[08:19:30] <dan2k3k4k5> hmm seems to be the beforeLoad event calling up ajax/page load ?
[09:03:09] <Sal> is i clone a table header inside a div, will it keep column width?
[09:03:14] <Sal> is=if
[09:04:17] <robertmaxrees> how are you setting the column width?
[09:08:45] <Sal> robertmaxrees, not setting
[09:08:47] <Sal> its auto
[09:09:17] <Sal> i'm trying to find a way to make a table header fixed when scrolling
[09:09:40] <Sal> so i was thinking on cloninf the header and showing a div when scrolling up
[09:09:48] <Sal> don't know if its the correct way
[09:09:53] <Sal> but should work well
[09:10:05] <Sal> the only problem couild be the widths
[09:10:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/dPixie/byB9d/3/
[09:10:13] <robertmaxrees> this is one way.
[09:10:29] <robertmaxrees> you can't clone just the table header and expect it to work magically.
[09:10:36] <SuperTyp> jquery mobile: is there a way of stopping page load, (if user tries to access page via url) if some data is not available? (login first!)
[09:13:33] <Sal> SuperTyp, thats a back-end thing
[09:14:01] <SuperTyp> Sal: what about beforechange function?
[09:14:14] <robertmaxrees> SuperTyp you don't "stop page load", you serve up a version of the page for unauthenticated users.
[09:14:35] <robertmaxrees> that's controlled server-side.
[09:14:42] <SuperTyp> robertmaxrees: yeah or redirect to login page, but how?
[09:14:45] <SuperTyp> with beforechange?
[09:14:48] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:14:50] <robertmaxrees> using your server.
[09:15:03] <robertmaxrees> the server says "oh this is an unauthenticated request" and redirects from there.
[09:15:30] <robertmaxrees> not from within jquery mobile.
[09:15:56] <SuperTyp> robertmaxrees: and with multiple page template?
[09:16:06] <mooncup> wat
[09:16:08] <robertmaxrees> again, this has nothing to do with jquery mobile.
[09:16:14] <mooncup> well you could return a 403 from the server
[09:16:14] <robertmaxrees> your server is where you do the work.
[09:16:25] <mooncup> and have jquery's ajax error handler redirect you to login
[09:16:35] <robertmaxrees> that's another way to do it i guess.
[09:16:40] <SuperTyp> I know, but this is something else...try to understand my problem first please
[09:16:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:16:53] <robertmaxrees> here we go.
[09:18:02] <SuperTyp> I have one HTML with multiple pages, the first one loaded is the login form there I do check the authorization and show #uploadForm if correct, which is in the same HTML
[09:18:37] <SuperTyp> now I was like uhm...what if somebody calls the url index.php#uploadForm
[09:19:01] <robertmaxrees> you check if the user is authenticated and, if not, redirect them to the login page.
[09:19:25] <robertmaxrees> you could do that using an ajax error handler.
[09:19:42] <robertmaxrees> or using your server-side and forcing it.
[09:21:20] <Sal> you can check for url change. if it contains #, then you stop loading the second page, unless you did it by code (setting some flag)
[09:21:40] <SuperTyp> thats the point, how do I know if the user is trying to access the second page
[09:21:48] <SuperTyp> how does my server know
[09:22:02] <Sal> there's an event on url change
[09:22:07] <Sal> its used on deep-linking
[09:22:19] <SuperTyp> ref?
[09:22:23] <SuperTyp> please :)
[09:22:24] <Sal> now, this is only a client-side stuff
[09:22:33] <Sal> jquery
[09:22:36] <robertmaxrees> right, but the ajax response would have that info.
[09:23:08] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to hit the server using ajax or something to verify that the user is logged in.
[09:23:15] <Sal> if i got it, he only wants to prevent users to jump to another page
[09:23:31] <robertmaxrees> or from navigating directly to those pages.
[09:23:47] <SuperTyp> exactly
[09:24:19] <robertmaxrees> the entire problem is they're predicating this on "stopping pageload" - that doesn't necessarily work because i can disable JS and boom, i have access to those parts of the site now.
[09:24:31] <SuperTyp> good point
[09:24:47] <SuperTyp> let me do it server side then, now .... how?
[09:25:12] <robertmaxrees> welcome to the catch - servers don't have context of hashes.
[09:25:26] <Sal> SuperTyp, hashchange event
[09:25:45] <robertmaxrees> Sal hashchange doesn't fire on load when the user goes directly to a page with a hash iirc.
[09:25:56] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to serve up each page separately, either as fully separate pages or using ajax to fetch each one.
[09:26:45] <SuperTyp> so the whole multipage thing is crap for authenticating?
[09:27:06] <robertmaxrees> in your case, pretty much,
[09:27:27] <SuperTyp> thank you guys
[09:27:29] <SuperTyp> (Y)
[09:34:30] <bendman> hey, when using the jquery-ui npm module, how do I set a theme? the module seems to include all of jquery-ui’s CSS itself
[09:35:20] <robertmaxrees> include the specific stylesheet(s) you want to use on your pages.
[09:42:20] <SuperTyp> when I create a element with var test = $("<div id='testdiv'>Test</div>"); why does this work $("#testdiv").remove(); but test.remove(); doesn't?
[09:42:33] <robertmaxrees> because the implicit variable 'test' is a bad idea.
[09:42:54] <robertmaxrees> also because test a DOM object, not a jquery object.
[09:43:28] <SuperTyp> why is it a bad idea?
[09:43:44] <SuperTyp> how would you do it?
[09:43:48] <robertmaxrees> it's an implicit variable that doesn't behave like most other variables.
[09:44:03] <robertmaxrees> http://wtfjs.com/2013/10/02/implicit-getElementById
[09:45:24] <SuperTyp> thank you sir
[09:46:00] <robertmaxrees> it's also really confusing when you suddenly see variables being used that weren't ever declared.
[10:03:44] <PCatinean> how does one get the nearest parent form? parent being key
[10:04:57] <robertmaxrees> .closest()
[10:21:07] <CreativeWolf> Heya all :)
[10:24:53] <CreativeWolf> I've got a JSON data from an API endpoint - http://staging.eimpressive.com/slimrestapi/test.php - Now need a drop down populated using data from JSON - http://jsfiddle.net/pdm1xscn/ - Can someone help please?
[10:27:36] <robertmaxrees> having a hard time working with the nata?
[10:27:37] <robertmaxrees> *data
[10:28:08] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Yeah, not able to populate the dropdown list :/
[10:28:43] <robertmaxrees> you realize region is populating, right?
[10:29:04] <daynaskully> {Q} if i'm using $("#elementID").scrollTop() -- should it be returning the pixels the element is from the top of the page? currently im getting a value of zero regardless of where i scroll
[10:30:01] <robertmaxrees> it gets whatever the scroll position is of that element.
[10:31:46] <robertmaxrees> CreativeWolf also, you don't want $('#region').on('change', function() {
[10:31:51] <robertmaxrees> not where you have it at least.
[10:32:44] <daynaskully> robertmaxrees:: so if the element is 1600px from the top of the page; it should return 1600 regardless of where i'm scrolled to? (as i'm currently getting 0 when it's 1600px from the top of the page)
[10:33:11] <robertmaxrees> daynaskully correct.  mind showing thge page where that's not working?
[10:33:31] <daynaskully> its all local currently.
[10:33:36] <robertmaxrees> fiddle, then?
[10:34:59] <robertmaxrees> CreativeWolf also, no need for $.each() if you don't need to support older browsers - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pdm1xscn/1/
[10:35:08] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Yes, region is getting populated but after that, depending on the region I select I'd like the country to populate...
[10:35:35] <robertmaxrees> easy
[10:36:04] <robertmaxrees> i'ma blow your mind :)
[10:36:05] <daynaskully> robertmaxrees:: offset().top seems to work over scrolltop
[10:36:13] <robertmaxrees> daynaskully weird.
[10:36:21] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Checked your jsfiddle, it's not populating country
[10:36:30] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: lol, thanks =)
[10:36:32] <robertmaxrees> CreativeWolf right, because i don't have that code in there...
[10:36:40] <robertmaxrees> you need deferreds ;)
[10:37:28] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: mmmm? :P
[10:39:42] <robertmaxrees> so first off, http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pdm1xscn/3/
[10:39:50] <robertmaxrees> country is still busted, but just work with me here.
[10:40:20] <robertmaxrees> i assume when you change "region", you want all countries with that region?
[10:40:57] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Yes, thats right and then basis country, plant
[10:41:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, easy.
[10:41:37] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Also, the way data is available, there are repetitions in the drop down right now, need to prune duplicates as well
[10:41:47] <robertmaxrees> we can do that in a minute.
[10:42:00] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Thanks much =)
[10:42:02] <robertmaxrees> you need map.
[10:42:04] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[10:42:09] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you for country.
[10:42:12] <robertmaxrees> you can figure it out for plant.
[10:42:19] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Cool
[10:47:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/pdm1xscn/4/
[10:47:18] <robertmaxrees> there.
[10:47:35] <robertmaxrees> this is why i love deferreds.
[10:47:38] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Checking...thanks...
[10:49:34] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: First time, it works, then when I again change the region, it doesn't list the Asian countries, you noticing that?
[10:50:12] <robertmaxrees> sure it is.
[10:50:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:50:19] <robertmaxrees> i'm just lazy and didn't empty out that dropdown first.
[10:50:29] <robertmaxrees> brb
[10:50:47] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Ahh.
[10:58:15] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/pdm1xscn/5/ - Fixed the refresh, working on the duplicates now :)
[10:58:22] <robertmaxrees> back
[10:58:33] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: welcome back =)
[10:59:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah,t here's an easy way to dedupe.
[11:01:03] <|RicharD|> guys how I can do a ajax request with FormData (processData: false/contentType: false) and keep my values correctly ?
[11:01:09] <|RicharD|> because now if a variable is null
[11:01:20] <|RicharD|> it's sent to the server like "null" (string)
[11:01:25] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: cool...
[11:02:46] <notchris> If I have an array with 3 items, and I have 3 list items, how do I print each array item to it’s own list item
[11:02:49] <robertmaxrees> |RicharD| iirc data is always shipped as strings.
[11:03:07] <notchris> I assume I would start with $(‘li’).each(function(){});
[11:03:18] <robertmaxrees> notchris other way around.
[11:03:23] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Let me know the trick to dedupe please
[11:03:23] <robertmaxrees> enumerate through the data.
[11:03:37] <robertmaxrees> CreativeWolf try searching google and see what you find.
[11:03:45] <robertmaxrees> try things and show me where you get stuf.
[11:03:54] <robertmaxrees> notchris access lis that match the array indexes.
[11:03:58] <robertmaxrees> that's one way, at least.
[11:04:31] <notchris> hmmm
[11:05:49] <robertmaxrees> notchris http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2umc72f4/
[11:05:50] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[11:06:13] <notchris> Ahhhh
[11:06:24] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Is forEach the js version of each?
[11:06:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  not supported in IE8 though.
[11:06:40] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of.
[11:06:42] <robertmaxrees> it's for arrays only.
[11:06:48] <robertmaxrees> not objects.
[11:06:52] <notchris> Does jquery 1 support all browsers?
[11:06:57] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Sure, got something working - http://jsfiddle.net/8otzua8a/ - Thats still the older code though.
[11:07:09] <robertmaxrees> CreativeWolf...
[11:07:14] <robertmaxrees> then why am i helping you?
[11:07:29] <robertmaxrees> notchris http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[11:07:38] <robertmaxrees> 1.x supports back to IE6
[11:07:49] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Wow!
[11:07:53] <notchris> Thanks robertmaxrees
[11:07:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[11:08:08] <notchris> That worked perfectly by the way
[11:08:12] <notchris> I appreciate the example :)
[11:08:14] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Woah. You helped a great deal. I was tinkering the duplicate issue on a different fiddle. Now to integrate it in the version you gave :)
[11:08:14] <robertmaxrees> deff.
[11:08:28] <robertmaxrees> CreativeWolf that doesn't really make sense.
[11:08:30] <robertmaxrees> but okay.
[11:08:52] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: :)
[11:23:12] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/pdm1xscn/8/ - Please check :)
[11:23:21] <robertmaxrees> is there something broken, ooor...?
[11:23:52] <robertmaxrees> (not going to go into the fiddle just to find out ;)
[11:27:42] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: No, thanks to you, fixed, now updating for Plant :)
[11:27:48] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[11:29:53] <tgodar> does the signature of the 'on' event handler determine if it is applied to new elements added to the DOM or is it the selector used?
[11:30:02] <robertmaxrees> both.
[11:30:07] <robertmaxrees> read the stuff about events bubbling.
[11:30:08] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:32:11] <tgodar> Is there a similar way to get a handler like 'sortable' to be applied to elements which are added later to the Dom?
[11:32:50] <shoky> nope
[11:33:07] <tgodar> cool, so my function hackReInitDnD() is a good approach :) ?
[11:33:48] <tgodar> until it oom kills the browser at least I suppose...
[11:35:11] <shoky> would need to see it to judge ;p
[11:36:28] <tgodar> final question... does simply re-invoking $('.ui-icon-seek-next').on('click', function() {...  cause another handler to just be pushed on, that is should I make an off call or something then re-apply the 'click' handler?
[11:36:50] <gtwy> id like to hear an answer to that as well tgodar
[11:37:18] <shoky> yes .on will add another new handler
[11:37:25] <gtwy> does it replace the old one
[11:37:26] <tgodar> feeling lazy to refactor things since I need to reapply DnD related after adding an element.. figure just reapply click handlers en masse too
[11:37:30] <gtwy> or will they b oth occure
[11:37:31] <shoky> no, it's another new one.
[11:37:34] <shoky> both
[11:37:48] <gtwy> so the best course of action would probably be to write an if statement on your on('click'
[11:38:04] <gtwy> rather than have two
[11:38:11] <tgodar> gtwy: how do eval if handler exists already?
[11:38:12] <CreativeWolf> robertBusy: http://jsfiddle.net/pdm1xscn/9/ - Updated for Plant as well - Thanks so much for the timely help! Appreciate it much =)
[11:38:48] <gtwy> tgodar: i dont know what it is you are trying to do, i am just speaking in generic terms
[11:39:25] <tgodar> gtwy: gotcha, just wondering how to check... thinking I'll just call off, then on.
[11:39:59] <tgodar> I'd hoped that same selector, same handler condition, same function, would just overwrite, not append...
[11:40:33] <tgodar> going to add some logging and ensure that in fact the handler is called twice..
[11:42:47] <tgodar> sure does :)
[12:11:31] <kokut> Hello, is it a bad idea to have many $(document).ready(...) ?
[12:12:00] <gtwy> why would you have more than one
[12:17:15] <kokut> gtwy: bc im working in long-ass scripts thats why
[12:18:22] <gtwy> kokut: cant you put all of it into a single document ready?
[12:18:26] <gtwy> i am a noob so dont listen to me
[12:18:29] <gtwy> but thats what i do
[12:20:45] <SuperTyp> jquery mobile: when I do pageContainer(change...) the page does change but not completly (headers are the same) when I do load, I get a POST with the data, but nothing changes?!
[12:21:08] <garethdaine> Folks, I have this function that I’m building for a responsive nav http://kopy.io/hqqHW
[12:21:10] <SuperTyp> http://pastie.org/10199199
[12:21:33] <kokut> gtwy: but that would require me to go through thousands of lines of code in several different documents looking for document ready calls and putting them all together, if its not really important i would pass really
[12:23:00] <gtwy> kokut: youre probably OK. read through here to be sure http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1327756/can-you-have-multiple-document-readyfunction-sections
[12:23:02] <garethdaine> Is there a way to reset the function on resize or stop the initial instantiation of it
[12:23:23] <gtwy> its definitely bad practice though
[12:29:06] <DEA7TH_> Can I have jQuery Mobile sliders without all the extra stuff? When I include the <script> it ruins my whole page, all I want is the sliders.
[12:29:32] <decx> use one of the 3 billion other sliders that come without a whole other lib you don't want
[12:29:47] <robertmaxrees> not without meeting the basic recs.  nouislider is a good choice otherwise.
[12:30:20] <decx> this seems like a good start https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&o=desc&q=slider&ref=searchresults&s=stars&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93
[12:31:27] <DEA7TH_> It helps a lot to know that I can’t achieve it, thanks people.
[12:38:47] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: http://staging.eimpressive.com/lpa_final/test.html - Thats the final one, however, it works fine in jsfiddle - http://jsfiddle.net/pdm1xscn/9/ with the dropdown getting emptied and refreshing but not on the other link - Any thoughts please?
[12:39:31] <robertmaxrees> ditch the alerts, first of all.
[12:39:42] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: On it now.
[12:39:48] <robertmaxrees> and the country drop down works fine for me.
[12:40:45] <robertmaxrees> also: what's with the marquee tag?!
[12:40:59] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Removed alerts. Yes, works fine, but when I change the region, it doesn't get reset like it does in jsfiddle.
[12:41:21] <robertmaxrees> works fine here.
[12:41:27] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Please ignore, it's a mandate :P
[12:42:35] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Oh. Weird. It doesn't for me. On Linux, using Chromium.
[12:43:19] <robertmaxrees> fine in in FF and Chrome on Win7
[12:44:40] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Weirdly, on the same Linux, Chromium, the jsfiddle resets fine but not on the other one.
[12:44:53] <robertmaxrees> cache?
[12:45:41] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Cleared cache, tried in incognito, nada.
[12:45:58] <CreativeWolf> Also tried on Mobile (Moto G) and on a Android Tablet.
[12:47:26] <robertmaxrees> fine on my phone.
[12:47:30] <robertmaxrees> cache is your problem.
[12:50:48] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: Hmm...
[12:52:54] <scrandaddy> Hello. Is there a clear distinction between listening to clicks using html vs document vs body as the delegate? They all seem to be pretty much the same, just the order they are called that is different
[12:53:08] <robertmaxrees> that's pretty much it.
[12:53:12] <robertmaxrees> nothing else to know.
[12:55:59] <scrandaddy> robertmaxrees: thanks :)
[12:56:30] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[12:58:29] <domino14> is there another way to get an element by id using jquery besides $('#' + id)?
[12:58:49] <robertmaxrees> if you're storing the id in a variable, no.
[13:09:24] <SuperTyp> robertmaxrees: can you please help me I have a problem I couldn't solve for hours now
[13:09:51] <SuperTyp> I have this code here http://pastie.org/10199281
[13:10:13] <robertmaxrees> thgere are over 700 people in here lol
[13:10:14] <robertmaxrees> but ok.
[13:10:22] <geoid> greetz!
[13:11:00] <geoid> I've got an issue where an ajax POST request within my application is getting a 403 response – but only from some clients. What could be causing that?
[13:11:21] <robertmaxrees> that's a forbidden, geoid
[13:11:29] <SuperTyp> it shows me the upload form after the ajax call, so good so far. but when I look at the dom, I see that the old page isn't removed, however, when I then click on submit of the upload page, I get redirected to the login page again...and its doing a GET ...
[13:11:40] <geoid> robertmaxrees I know that but why would some clients get it and not others?
[13:11:52] <robertmaxrees> geoid check your server.  that's where the codes come from.
[13:11:55] <robertmaxrees> look at your logs.
[13:12:08] <geoid> I can't find any 403's in the logs
[13:12:14] <robertmaxrees> geoid O.o
[13:12:20] <robertmaxrees> no clue then.
[13:12:26] <robertmaxrees> that's not a jquery problem,tbh.
[13:12:45] <SuperTyp> for the upload form I did quite the same but ajax to another script, that handles the file upload
[13:12:51] <geoid> robertmaxrees true.. but not sure where to ask it. I am using jQuery to handle the $.post which is returning forbidden
[13:13:07] <robertmaxrees> geoid right, but the server is the one responding inconsistently :)
[13:13:18] <geoid> where would you ask that?
[13:13:20] <robertmaxrees> check in a channel about your server/server-side language.
[13:13:29] <robertmaxrees> or #web
[13:13:33] <robertmaxrees> they mightbe able to help.
[13:14:26] <geoid> robertmaxrees ok tx. btw, which log would you check for 403's? error or access?
[13:14:33] <robertmaxrees> both.
[13:14:45] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what server you're using, and i don't know how your shit is configured.
[13:14:51] <SuperTyp> :D
[13:15:10] <robertmaxrees> SuperTyp no clue how to help you.l  i'd need a functioning example to understand.
[13:15:39] <SuperTyp> ok, maybe I can set one up
[13:17:15] <robertmaxrees> SuperTyp wait.
[13:17:23] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "when i look at the dom"?
[13:17:32] <SuperTyp> at the HTML source
[13:17:34] <SuperTyp> firebug
[13:17:45] <robertmaxrees> okay.  how are you replacing the page?
[13:20:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing where you actually change the page.  your load method is doing an upload, but then you don't do anything after that.
[13:20:27] <SuperTyp> with http://pastie.org/10199297
[13:20:43] <robertmaxrees> right, you're posting to that page.
[13:20:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't do anythving after you post.
[13:21:33] <andrew-l> hi, i'm new to jquery (but do other programming like ruby and C). i have a question about making multiple jquery calls in a row
[13:21:59] <SuperTyp> robertmaxrees: the upload.php echos the new form
[13:22:12] <robertmaxrees> SuperTyp go read up about how posts work :)
[13:22:44] <robertmaxrees> andrew-l go ahead and ask :)
[13:24:05] <andrew-l> i'm kinda hacking something together using jquery-simulate: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-simulate - i want a drag to happen x-times, but when i call drag x-times in a row, the drag only occurs once.
[13:24:08] <SuperTyp> I dont know what you mean, the form gets well displayed but the submit button is not doing that what it should
[13:24:37] <andrew-l> how can i call drag and have it occur x-times?
[13:24:41] <robertmaxrees> SuperTyp so the new page DOES display?
[13:24:41] <andrew-l> (in a row)
[13:24:51] <SuperTyp> robertmaxrees: yes
[13:25:00] <robertmaxrees> then your event binding is bad.
[13:25:05] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener on a parent element.
[13:25:18] <SuperTyp> ? :)
[13:25:24] <SuperTyp> how
[13:25:30] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[13:26:00] <decx> the learn page is good now http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[13:26:11] <robertmaxrees> oh sweet that's a good choice, too.
[13:28:24] <chriys> how can I get the object that just have been saved?
[13:28:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:36:49] <tgodar> Hi, something I'm not getting about how ui tabs.  Have this snippet for a 'remote form' but fails to work correctly in browsers other than Chrome unless that tab is the one visible by default.  Ive dealt with similar before... wondered what a quick fix might be
[13:37:01] <tgodar> *how ui tabs work
[13:37:43] <robertmaxrees> what about it doesn't work?
[13:38:41] <tgodar> well robertmaxrees if I knew that I'd fix it
[13:38:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:39:15] <tgodar> If there were an error or I understand the issue I would address it,
[13:39:15] <robertmaxrees> "Have this snippet for a 'remote form' but fails to work correctly in browsers other than Chrome unless that tab is the one visible by default." - obviously you know what isn't working correctly.
[13:39:17] <robertmaxrees> so what is it?
[13:39:26] <robertmaxrees> how do you know it's not "working correctly" then?
[13:40:08] <robertmaxrees> i'm not asking if you understand what's causing the problem, i'm asking what the problem is.  you're saying "this remote form doesn't work unless the tab is visible by default" - great.  what about it doesn't work?
[13:41:44] <tgodar> I can rubber duck well enough, wondered if what I described was familiar, like I said Ive dealt with similar before.  Does JS inside the ui tab pane not get parsed?  i.e. does the ui tab stuff somehow sandbox things or similar
[13:42:03] <robertmaxrees> hoo boy.
[13:42:04] <robertmaxrees> enjoy then.
[13:42:58] <tgodar> don't get your feathers in a ruffle :) just asking
[13:43:24] <robertmaxrees> you asked for help, were vague, and then argued.  i'm not in the mood for that kind of attitude.  sorry!
[13:43:30] <tgodar> I don't want to waste your time, I get how it helps to provide more details, again, just asking if its familiar
[13:43:35] <andrew-l> robertmaxrees: aaah. after some more thinking, i think my problem is that i am working with jquery animations and i need to create a callback function so multiple calls to the function will be executed multiple times...
[13:44:17] <robertmaxrees> andrew-l in that case, check out .done()
[13:45:45] <robertmaxrees> though i'm not sure that'd help since you're not directly interfacing with the elements themselves.
[13:45:57] <andrew-l> well, in this case, i am.
[13:46:05] <robertmaxrees> but not with the animate calls.
[13:46:21] <robertmaxrees> you're "simularting" a user.
[13:46:26] <robertmaxrees> *simulating
[13:46:27] <andrew-l> yeah, exactly.
[13:46:38] <andrew-l> $(el).simulate('drag', ...)
[13:46:43] <robertmaxrees> right, so you can't chain off the actual animation queue.
[13:46:53] <andrew-l> aaah, ok.
[13:47:17] <andrew-l> well, in simulate, it's mouseup/down events
[13:47:26] <andrew-l> is that the same?
[13:47:31] <robertmaxrees> doens't change anything.
[13:47:40] <robertmaxrees> you'd need access to the actual queue, which you do not have.
[13:47:57] <andrew-l> hmm... ok, that's good to know
[13:49:23] <andrew-l> i wonder if there's another way to solve my problem.
[13:49:42] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[13:50:09] <andrew-l> i did make direct calls to simulate to move X-amount. but there was a bug with moving down
[13:50:30] <andrew-l> (i'm working on top of gridster)
[13:50:39] <robertmaxrees> and again, you cannot access that information, because you need access to the actual .animate() call.
[13:50:47] <robertmaxrees> which isn't exposed to you.
[13:51:08] <robertmaxrees> how long do the animations last?
[13:51:16] <chriys> how can I get the type of file in my form?
[13:51:25] <andrew-l> well, this was the call i made to simulate: $(el).simulate('drag', {moves: 1, dx: X-amount, dy: Y-amount})
[13:51:34] <andrew-l> and the drag would move X and Y amounts.
[13:51:53] <robertmaxrees> andrew-l see if there's a callback that simulate provides
[13:52:03] <andrew-l> the animation time doesn't matter. i literally want one thing to be dragged for X + Y amounts.
[13:52:15] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript get filetype in form
[13:52:15] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: javascript - Check file type when form submit? - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7977084/check-file-type-when-form-submit
[13:52:23] <robertmaxrees> awww he left.
[13:52:26] <andrew-l> thanks robertmaxrees,
[13:52:32] <andrew-l> i'll keep digging and trying.
[13:58:09] <lintguy> I have a bunch of items i want to paginate, so i thought i'd use this plugin https://flaviusmatis.github.io/simplePagination.js but how the hell do i format my data to use it?
[13:59:07] <robertmaxrees> that plugin literally just handles the pagination widget, not the pagination itself.
[13:59:40] <CreativeWolf> robertmaxrees: *YAY* found the issue. Since I'm using jQuery Mobile, it has auto generated a <div> and <span> and the <span> was getting populated, which I wasn't appending. Its sorted now. Thanks so much again! =)
[13:59:47] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: So it's just a pagination themer then?
[14:00:06] <robertmaxrees> lintguy it supplies the widget and methods for working with the widget.
[14:00:12] <lintguy> Why not include samples on how to paginate for it...
[14:00:25] <robertmaxrees> lintguy because you wouldn't use it to control your pagination.
[14:00:30] <robertmaxrees> it'd be the other way around.
[14:01:02] <lintguy> Well that's confusing
[14:01:05] <robertmaxrees> you control it.
[14:01:41] <robertmaxrees> notice how there's a "onPageClick" callback?
[14:01:54] <lintguy> Yes
[14:02:11] <robertmaxrees> you'd use that to fire your own logic to actually change the page.
[14:03:52] <lintguy> What i have is a list of items from json that i did a for loop on and generate a bunch of items, i just want to split it up into pages.
[14:05:17] <robertmaxrees> pop them into containers that you hide/show.
[14:05:21] <robertmaxrees> each container serves as a "page
[14:49:41] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: But how do i slice up an array of items into sections? I have never done that before
[14:49:59] <robertmaxrees> how might one /slice/ an array?
[14:50:29] <lintguy> Yeah, like slice an array of items into sections.
[14:50:43] <robertmaxrees> if only there were some function for slicing arrays.
[14:51:02] <lintguy> slice
[14:51:27] <lintguy> i know, and i've looked at samples and read about but i still don't get it
[14:51:32] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11318680/split-array-into-chunks-of-n-length
[14:51:37] <robertmaxrees> this is one way.
[14:51:52] <robertmaxrees> actually, too ways
[14:51:55] <robertmaxrees> *two
[14:52:30] <lintguy> Thanks, that makes my head hurt
[14:52:34] <lintguy> but i can play around with it
[14:52:37] <robertmaxrees> whyfor?
[14:52:59] <robertmaxrees> both are pretty simple.
[14:53:23] <lintguy> maybe if you use them often
[14:53:28] <robertmaxrees> i don't.
[14:53:32] <robertmaxrees> but i can read the code.
[14:54:38] <lintguy> while the array size is larger than zero, push a sliced part of a into the array?
[14:54:49] <robertmaxrees> look at what it pushes back out.
[14:55:30] <lintguy> a chunk of 3 items
[14:55:48] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/dokivomuzake/1/edit?js,console
[14:55:54] <robertmaxrees> should make some more sense now.
[14:57:16] <lintguy> Yeah, i think i can handle it :)
[14:57:21] <lintguy> Thanks for the help
[14:59:37] <lintguy> Well look at that, i got pagination working
[14:59:47] <robertmaxrees> awesome! :)D
[15:00:24] <lintguy> With your help i figured out what simplePagination actually does
[15:00:32] <robertmaxrees> awesome :)
[15:01:42] <lintguy> I even added a callback now to check if the page height changes, then make the pagesize smaller so the items fit :)
[15:01:49] <lintguy> eh, event
[15:02:01] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  be careful with that, though.
[15:02:05] <robertmaxrees> those resizes fire a LOT.
[15:02:14] <lintguy> Yeah, i added a timeout
[15:02:43] <robertmaxrees> did you cache things correctly?
[15:02:48] <robertmaxrees> because that's FAR more important imo.
[15:02:57] <lintguy> You mean cache selectors?
[15:03:04] <robertmaxrees> pretty much.
[15:03:17] <lintguy> That's like putting them in a variable right?
[15:03:54] <lintguy> Because i have always done like this: var items = $(".files .thumbWrapper");
[15:04:14] <lintguy> Then i use items in the code instead of the selector
[15:04:44] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: Any other caching tricks i should know?
[15:13:47] <robertmaxrees> make sure you store those outside of the resize function callback.
[15:14:14] <lintguy> Yeah, else it would get overwritten every time it runs
[15:14:40] <robertmaxrees> right, and you wopuldn't get the benefits of it.
[15:14:43] <lintguy> i'm reading about promises and deferred now
[15:14:56] <robertmaxrees> those are amazing.
[15:15:07] <lintguy> yeah, can't belive i haven't heard of it before
[15:16:54] <robertmaxrees> i've done a few projects that really leaned on them in some meaninfgul ways and it made my code soooo much clearer.
[15:16:56] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: do you know of any well structured jquery script that use good caching, promises and deferreds? I like to learn by example
[15:17:12] <robertmaxrees> not really?
[15:17:22] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: sounds awesome, is it something i can see?
[15:17:32] <robertmaxrees> let me see if it was minified.
[15:17:47] <lintguy> it's ok if you don't want to share it
[15:17:59] <lintguy> i don't intend on using it, only learn
[15:18:09] <robertmaxrees> it's all out there in the world anyway ;)
[15:18:32] <lintguy> yeah, but some people like to sit on stuff and do uglification on all scripts they have....
[15:18:46] <robertmaxrees> we minify to reduce filesize
[15:18:52] <robertmaxrees> not trying to protect code or anything.
[15:18:52] <lintguy> yeah i know that
[15:19:03] <lintguy> but scrambling makes it larger, but harder to read
[15:19:16] <lintguy> minification is just good practise
[15:19:28] <lintguy> scrambling is just silly
[15:20:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah nothing out publicly at the moment.  i had an example of promises in use...
[15:20:22] <robertmaxrees> hrmmm.
[15:20:41] <lintguy> It's ok, i'm slowly getting it
[15:21:08] <lintguy> seems ridiculously much better than having callback functions in the ajax code
[15:21:40] <lintguy> "It’s safer to work with promises when we don’t need to update the state."
[15:21:46] <lintguy> And a state is exactly?
[15:22:00] <robertmaxrees> once a promise resolves or rejects, that's it.
[15:22:09] <robertmaxrees> it can't do anything else.
[15:22:14] <robertmaxrees> to the data it references doens't change.
[15:22:23] <lintguy> Ah, but that's what is needed in 90% of the case
[15:22:29] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[15:22:31] <lintguy> at least on smallish projects
[15:22:35] <robertmaxrees> 90% of the time, the data DOESN'T update.
[15:22:40] <robertmaxrees> at least not the way you think it does :)
[15:22:49] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hmxa8ryy/ this is a contrived example of promises.
[15:22:51] <lintguy> true that
[15:24:53] <lintguy> robertmaxrees: That's just awesome, but it does require a different way of thinking and structuring
[15:25:17] <robertmaxrees> absolutely.  but it's a much cleaner way of thinking.
[15:25:20] <robertmaxrees> act as if the data is there.
[15:25:30] <lintguy> Yeah
[15:26:01] <lintguy> I see it returns the element, does it return a response in case of ajax promise?
[15:26:12] <lintguy> Or just a status code?
[15:26:41] <lilalinuxKL> #css is dead, but maybe you can help me: https://jsfiddle.net/lilalinux/u0kt7uns/2/ I'm trying to have the first row of the table position:fixed, but only for vertical position. If scrolled horizontally, it should scroll normally
[15:27:28] <lintguy> overflow-x ?
[15:28:48] <lilalinuxKL> no, more like "window freeze" in excel
[15:28:57] <lintguy> lilalinuxKL: I don't really get what you are trying to do
[15:29:03] <lintguy> you want to scroll that tiny content?
[15:29:11] <robertmaxrees> the example needs more rows to show.
[15:29:29] <robertmaxrees> and columns.  one sec.
[15:29:36] <lintguy> Yeah
[15:29:41] <lilalinuxKL> lintguy: you can make the section smaller
[15:31:03] <lintguy> UGH
[15:31:05] <robertmaxrees> they basically want it to be fixed position in one axis but not the other.
[15:31:07] <lintguy> when did the clock get this late
[15:31:24] <lilalinuxKL> robertmaxrees: exactly
[15:31:38] <robertmaxrees> to which i reply: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12545042/position-fixed-horizontal-scroll
[15:32:15] <robertmaxrees> or http://stackoverflow.com/a/14274914/923919

[15:39:37] <robertmaxrees> lol tables.
[15:40:10] <robertmaxrees> and that's being generic.
[15:41:32] <lilalinuxKL> well, I always tried position:fixed, but the solution was window.scroll and 'top': $(this).scrollTop()
[15:41:44] <robertmaxrees> the solition gives you an idea to run with.
[15:41:48] <robertmaxrees> not a copy/paste solution.
[15:41:56] <robertmaxrees> plus you need to handle left/right.
[15:41:59] <robertmaxrees> not vertical.
[15:43:46] <lilalinuxKL> yeah, I still need the first column to behave accordingly, but that should be easy now
[15:47:56] <lilalinuxKL> done

[16:01:19] <hd1> anyone want to help a
[16:01:24] <hd1> query idiot
[16:01:30] <hd1> jquery idiot
[16:01:35] <robertmaxrees> !ask
[16:01:35] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[16:01:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:01:49] <hd1> thanks
[16:02:34] <hd1> $(this).text(thePage); should replace the text of the element pointed to by this with the contents of thePage, right?
[16:02:47] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:02:48] <robertmaxrees> sort of?
[16:02:51] <robertmaxrees> what is thePage?
[16:03:35] <hd1> thePage is a string obtained from an AJAX call
[16:03:45] <robertmaxrees> then yes, that will work.
[16:05:14] <hd1> therobertmaxrees: care to lend a second pair of eyes to this then? http://links.d8u.us
[16:05:32] <robertmaxrees> please make a fiddle or fixee the relevant code.
[16:05:45] <hd1> http://hasan.d8u.us/links.js is the relevant code
[16:06:21] <robertmaxrees> we covered this a while back.
[16:06:21] <hd1> I see in the Safari console, that I'm getting the right data, but it's just not being put into the element as it should be
[16:06:30] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is not the element in that function.
[16:06:41] <annoymouse> Need some help with this jQuery
[16:07:09] <annoymouse> I want to add a background to an element when it is clicked
[16:07:22] <annoymouse> but I want it to be removed when a click happens anywhere else on the page
[16:07:24] <robertmaxrees> hd1 http://fixee.org/paste/bhuxp02/
[16:07:40] <robertmaxrees> annoymouse what all do you have so far?
[16:08:54] <annoymouse> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/KPcivdA6
[16:09:23] <annoymouse> The problem is the click event on the body is overriding the other one
[16:10:15] <arc_> so add if ($highlighted.hasClass('highlight'))
[16:10:29] <annoymouse> arc_: To where?
[16:10:36] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:10:37] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:10:44] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/zex7al2/
[16:10:46] <robertmaxrees> this is what you want.
[16:11:32] <annoymouse> robertmaxrees: So e.stopPropagation, eh?
[16:11:42] <annoymouse> I figured there was something like that, but couldn't find it in the docs
[16:11:45] <annoymouse> thanks
[16:12:05] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/category/events/event-object/
[16:12:09] <robertmaxrees> for more info.
[16:12:35] <hd1> still not replacing the element in safari
[16:12:56] <robertmaxrees> that is not what i showed you.
[16:13:05] <robertmaxrees> oh wait haha
[16:13:06] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:13:31] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/bhuxp02/#url=mhl2dke
[16:13:33] <robertmaxrees> there we go.
[16:14:16] <robertmaxrees> hd1 this has to deal with invocation context - your original $(this) was bound to the ajax call itself, instead of the .on() callback.
[16:15:09] <hd1> good eye
[16:15:59] <hd1> now, I'd like it to have different behaviours based on the url, mouseover the imgur link for a sample
[16:16:08] <robertmaxrees> ...
[16:16:10] <hd1> i'd like that inserted instead of the link text
[16:16:20] <robertmaxrees> i closed the window.
[16:16:31] <hd1> http://links.d8u.us
[16:16:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:17:00] <robertmaxrees> $this.html(data);
[16:17:28] <robertmaxrees> instead of using text.
[16:17:37] <robertmaxrees> also: learn.jquery.com
[16:17:53] <robertmaxrees> this is a great resource you should take advantage of :)
[16:17:58] <annoymouse> robertmaxrees: Works like a charm. thanks again
[16:22:54] <EminenceHC> Is it possible to find the NEXT div in the DOM, REGARDLESS of being a parent, sibling whatever, just the next one wherever that happens to be?
[16:23:01] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[16:23:17] <EminenceHC> Thanks
[16:23:22] <robertmaxrees> could build a recursive function to do that pretty quickly though
[16:30:45] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC something like http://fixee.org/paste/5zclkmt/
[16:38:19] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: Thank you sir.
[16:38:28] <robertmaxrees> i didn't even test that.
[16:38:30] <robertmaxrees> did it work?
[16:54:44] <DarkElement> Hey guys how can I include this editable table plugin? https://github.com/mindmup/editable-table/blob/master/mindmup-editabletable.js
[16:55:08] <robertmaxrees> download it, include it in the page.
[16:55:38] <DarkElement> alright will try
[17:06:42] <DarkElement> How can I include the whole directory?
[17:06:46] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[17:06:49] <robertmaxrees> needs to be each file.
[17:06:52] <DarkElement> Dang
[17:06:54] <DarkElement> Alright.
[17:10:22] <DarkElement> Have you seen the plugin? I'm not sure I do have to include all the files.
[17:10:31] <robertmaxrees> http://mindmup.github.io/editable-table/
[17:10:43] <DarkElement> Yea, i've been reading through that.
[17:10:47] <DarkElement> You are a fast responder btw
[17:10:50] <DarkElement> :D
[17:11:16] <robertmaxrees> you just need the JS
[17:11:33] <DarkElement> I included the 2 main js files
[17:11:52] <robertmaxrees> which?
[17:11:59] <DarkElement> And the script used in the example table, as well as changing the table id of my own, however nothing.
[17:12:01] <robertmaxrees> you only need  mindmup-editabletable.js
[17:12:19] <DarkElement> mindmup-editabletable.js and numeric-input-example.js
[17:12:27] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[17:12:34] <robertmaxrees> network panel clean?  etc.
[17:13:01] <ISmithers> Hey all, I need to validate a group of checkboxes with the jquery validation plugin. Does anyone have a good method to do this?
[17:13:26] <ISmithers> (I'm somewhat limited in my access to $.validator as the jquery code is created from asp.net in C#)
[17:13:36] <DarkElement> robertmaxrees, yea it's in that mindmup file.
[17:13:42] <DarkElement> Lookin through now.
[17:13:44] <drej> robertmaxrees: http://i.pud.ca/image/3t0z3S2c1H0p
[17:13:51] <drej> that plugin is judging me
[17:13:59] <robertmaxrees> drej hahahahahahaha
[17:14:09] <robertmaxrees> that's awesome.
[17:14:20] <DarkElement> I saw that in the table example actually
[17:14:26] <DarkElement> Was that what you were referring to?
[17:14:33] <robertmaxrees> on your page.
[17:14:57] <robertmaxrees> DarkElement it's hard to help because you're saying it doesn't work, but there could be plenty of reasons why.
[17:15:11] <robertmaxrees> console errors, bad config, etc.
[17:15:18] <DarkElement> yea,
[17:15:21] <DarkElement> Here are the errors
[17:15:40] <robertmaxrees> use fixee or something if you're going to paste
[17:15:50] <DarkElement> yea ik
[17:16:01] <drej> robertmaxrees: spoil sport
[17:16:10] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:16:10] <DarkElement> http://paste.pound-python.org/show/EGzIyaLMZdMcMZdhk6dp/
[17:16:24] <robertmaxrees> you don't have jquery included.
[17:16:31] <robertmaxrees> needs to be before everything else.
[17:16:38] <DarkElement> <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>
[17:16:41] <DarkElement> I did this
[17:16:41] <DarkElement> Oh
[17:16:47] <DarkElement> It needs to be before the other includes
[17:16:51] <robertmaxrees> yes
[17:16:59] <drej> also do src="// instead of src="http://
[17:16:59] <DarkElement> o_o
[17:17:04] <DarkElement> sur
[17:17:06] <DarkElement> sure*
[17:17:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah that, too.
[17:17:59] <vinex08> http://prntscr.com/77k2t7  <--- what does it mean? .. the code does work in jsfiddle..
[17:18:20] <DarkElement> It works for me after that, yea
[17:18:22] <robertmaxrees> the plugin isn't loaded before you try to use it.
[17:18:32] <DarkElement> Thanks a lot robertmaxrees
[17:18:37] <robertmaxrees> vinex08 make sure the include for pietimer is before your code.
[17:18:40] <robertmaxrees> DarkElement fsho.
[17:18:45] <DarkElement> XD
[17:18:47] <annoymouse> robertmaxrees: I have another problem
[17:18:54] <robertmaxrees> don't we all?
[17:18:57] <vinex08> ohh yeah!! thanks
[17:19:01] <DarkElement> lmao
[17:19:05] <DarkElement> Alright back to work
[17:19:18] <annoymouse> robertmaxrees: I want it to unhighlight if there's a click on anything BUT the highlighted word
[17:19:29] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:19:40] <robertmaxrees> share your fiddle back out.
[17:19:43] <annoymouse> so I tried using $("body").not(".highlight").click(), but it's not working
[17:19:45] <robertmaxrees> or code or whatever.
[17:20:12] <robertmaxrees> $("body").not(".highlight").click() is looking for all body tags that don't have a highlight class.
[17:20:14] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[17:20:29] <robertmaxrees> and don't use .click() for that.
[17:20:29] <annoymouse> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/vzKeM9fD
[17:20:33] <drej> he doesnt not want to do it
[17:20:40] <robertmaxrees> $('.highlight').removeClass('highlight')
[17:20:46] <annoymouse> robertmaxrees: I realize that, but I'm not sure how to replace it
[17:21:07] <robertmaxrees> $("body").click(function () {
[17:21:32] <annoymouse> that doesn't do what I need though
[17:21:41] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:24:01] <robertmaxrees> oh hahaha
[17:24:28] <robertmaxrees> because you can't bind to body any more for this.
[17:24:35] <drej> thats what she said?
[17:24:38] <drej> ok now im reaching
[17:24:56] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/vLw8z5ne/1/ annoymouse
[17:25:15] <robertmaxrees> if you want to unhighlight in other places, then the body binding will work.
[17:25:30] <annoymouse> nah that's not it either
[17:25:35] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:25:37] <robertmaxrees> wat
[17:25:57] <annoymouse> robertmaxrees: I want to unhighlight if the user clicks anywhere EXCEPT for the word itself
[17:26:04] <robertmaxrees> sorry *if you want to unhighlight when clicking elsewhere, the body binding will work, too.
[17:26:08] <robertmaxrees> but you need both.
[17:26:21] <annoymouse> Let me try that
[17:29:14] <rn10950> In jQuery UI, using a cancel option on .resizable(), is there a way to disable the cursor changes where the handles would normally be?
[17:37:07] <ISmithers> What is this naming convention I see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26041435/jquery-validation-plugin-errorplacement-for-checkbox where he has named his checkbox "q8[]"
[17:37:10] <ISmithers> Why "[]" ?
[17:37:52] <robertmaxrees> that's gross.
[17:37:57] <robertmaxrees> some backends are weird.
[17:38:01] <robertmaxrees> but i wouldn'ty do that.
[17:38:15] <annoymouse> robertmaxrees: That fixed part of it
[17:38:29] <annoymouse> robertmaxrees: I'm also showing a tooltip at the same time
[17:38:35] <annoymouse> and for some reason that's broken now
[17:38:39] <annoymouse> *popover
[17:38:46] * robertmaxrees shrugs
[17:38:51] <robertmaxrees> dunno man.
[17:40:56] <rn10950> Here's an example: http://jsfiddle.net/xchg5w6t/
[17:42:14] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i disappear.  enjoy folks.
[18:04:28] <vinex08> http://fiddle.jshell.net/yupnwtrm/6/  i added a show and hide codes... but jsfiddle detects them as errors.. what;s wrong
[18:06:26] <BillCriswell> vinex08: jQuery.('.foo') is not valid.
[18:06:58] <BillCriswell> jQuery.('access-true').show(); should probably be jQuery('.access-true').show()
[18:17:41] <vinex08> BillCriswell: i didn't see the dot! thanks!!!
[18:17:50] <BillCriswell> Cool.
[18:17:53] <BillCriswell> Welcome!
[18:19:37] <vinex08> now i guess my main question: the other class should disappear when the timer is complete
[18:19:38] <vinex08> http://fiddle.jshell.net/yupnwtrm/7/
[18:21:46] <BillCriswell> "access-true" isn't a selector for the element ou think it is, you want to select it by class name, not element name.
[18:24:41] <azx> Why does .wrapAll move around my html
[18:25:04] <azx> if i have an array of eleemnts in the dom selected it will move them all into a row
[18:25:12] <azx> and then wrap all
[18:25:33] <azx> i will use wrap instead
[18:27:03] <vinex08> the missing dots! i t hink i'll should get some sleep first ... thanks and gnyt!
[18:47:49] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[18:50:13] <oojacoboo> will getJSON reorder my array by indexes?
[18:50:24] <oojacoboo> object collection*
[18:52:09] <BillCriswell> oojacoboo: No. Object order is up to the browser completely.
[18:52:22] <oojacoboo> browser?!
[18:52:42] <oojacoboo> so it doesn't acknowledge key order?
[18:53:05] <oojacoboo> I guess for an object that doesn't really matter O_o
[18:53:16] <BillCriswell> Exactly. You sound like you want an array.
[20:21:29] <azx> So detach() removes content but keeps data and event handlers
[20:21:32] <azx> whats the use of that?
[20:21:37] <azx> what is data?
[20:21:55] <azx> if the element is removed won't the event handlers be inaccessible?
[20:29:48] <azx> I've just been told it's used when your planning to re-insert content later on
[21:38:45] <sahil> http://jsfiddle.net/4ucxj1Le/1/

[22:59:55] <Starcraftmazter> hi

[23:55:33] <pauled> 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ='
[23:55:36] <Woet> okay
