[00:02:21] <theBrettman> anyone know why event.target.localname=undefined?
[00:02:26] <nisseni> http://pastie.org/private/vqsynkiqvscw5wdcvqxjg - I'm not very good with jQuery - what I'm trying to achieve is to get the form data into the #nordic_result div - could someone point me in the right direction
[00:04:11] <Whirl3d> kostodo, I don't know anything about the cycle plugin, but you can see what I am talking about here: http://jsfiddle.net/Mbhf4/15/
[00:04:12] <jmaister> Hi! I'm having a scaling issue. I'm drawing a scaled element to fit screen size, but it misses the first time: http://cl.ly/161C1t0U2M0B022c3t1I This happens in a browser as well if you reload enough times. Any ideas why the scaling misses the first time?
[00:06:05] <Whirl3d> jmaister, seriously, without code, it's kinda hard to tell. I'd be willing to bet your images aren't loaded by the time you call the resize script, but that's just a guess since I don't have any code to look at
[00:06:32] <jmaister> Whirl3d: Good ponit. Gimmie a sec
[00:06:47] <kostodo> Whirl3d: having a look now
[00:08:33] <kostodo> Whirl3d: its not working for me
[00:08:45] <jmaister> Whirl3d: this is the relevant part http://pastebin.com/j34J98QP and this is the whole darn thing http://pastebin.com/94D2Khj4
[00:08:51] <Whirl3d> nisseni, what you have there, from my perspective, is less a jquery issue and more a decision issue. Either use jquery/javascript to populate your page or use php, but trying to weave both, at least in the way that you have done it, is much more difficult than it needs to be
[00:09:55] <Whirl3d> kostodo, I don't know what the params are for the cycle plugin...double check the docs. But you can see (if you inpsect the code with firebug or something) that the prev and next buttons only get added once.
[00:10:11] <KoVaLskY> Hello everybody from Russia
[00:10:27] <kostodo> Whirl3d: yeah the params are next: item and prev: item
[00:10:56] <kostodo> Whirl3d: problem is in your code when i click prev (and next is not showing) it disappears
[00:11:09] <milardovich> Hey guys, could you take a look at this again? http://pellegrinioscarv.com.ar/listaprecios/listar_pedidos.php?id_rubro=1&id_subrubro=35&id_marca=5 just click in "comprar" and then in the big red button
[00:11:15] <milardovich> That alery is working extremely weird -.-
[00:12:35] <Whirl3d> jmaister, where do you set the value for size in your document.ready function ?
[00:13:32] <jmaister> Whirl3d: $(document).height()
[00:13:47] <jmaister> ah
[00:13:50] <Whirl3d> kostodo, that's what I am saying. I don't know the cycle plugin, but it appears that it is checking for the first and last elements and eliminating the prev (if there are no previous) and the next (if there are no next items). So that causes problems with 2 elements.
[00:13:57] <jmaister> size is the number of rows
[00:14:09] <jmaister> Whirl3d: all the way at the top
[00:14:26] <kostodo> Whirl3d: no it wouldn't do that. it simply binds those handlers to whatever selector you give it in next: and prev:
[00:14:52] <jmaister> milardovich: what is weird, or what do you try to achieve?
[00:15:18] <milardovich> jmaister: look at the onclick="alert(... in the red button
[00:15:29] <milardovich> It always shows "abc", also when I change the input value
[00:15:33] <Whirl3d> kostodo, gimme a minute to learn the cycle plugin...that's where your problem is
[00:15:35] <milardovich> And there is no duplicate ids
[00:15:49] <kostodo> Whirl3d: okay
[00:19:04] <jmaister> milardovich: #cantidad<number> has value="abc", so when you get $('#cantidad').val() it will always return abc
[00:19:04] <milardovich> jmaister: any suggestions?
[00:19:19] <milardovich> jmaister: but try to change the value
[00:19:27] <milardovich> I mean, to write something in the input
[00:19:31] <KoVaLskY> Please tell me how to make one-click run once 2 animations for jQuery? I have a basket, working on ajax. I want to be that after adding to cart, a dialog box appears.
[00:19:33] <milardovich> And then click the red button again
[00:19:48] <KoVaLskY> I am sorry for my bad English
[00:22:12] <milardovich> KoVaLskY: you can try something like this -> http://pastebin.com/bJrBC7bT
[00:27:41] <jmaister> milardovich: I'm a bit confused actually. Ask Stack Overflow
[00:28:20] <milardovich> Ok
[00:36:08] <slax> Anyone else had any problems with googles CDN today? I thought I had the wrong URL but it appears as if it was down for a little while. My fallback methods luckily worked as intended :)
[00:39:27] <jmaister> Whirl3d: Any ideas yet?
[00:46:12] <Whirl3d> kostodo, http://jsfiddle.net/Mbhf4/27/
[00:46:29] <jmaister> Whirl3d: Do you think executing the rendering _after_ document.ready() with .bind("ready", init()), would make a difference?
[00:47:11] <Whirl3d> jmaister, try $(window).height rather than $(document).height....?
[00:48:30] <Whirl3d> jmaister, what happens if you change line 137 to $("#content").height($(window).height());
[00:50:00] <jmaister> same thing :/
[00:50:05] <Whirl3d> jmaister, try this:
[00:50:37] <Whirl3d> load your images (which you don't load until initboard() as bg images) before you do anything
[00:51:12] <Whirl3d> that way they are cached. I still think that you are having a problem with sizing the content because the images aren't loaded when you first init
[00:53:18] <jmaister> that didn't work either. remember: the images are being scaled as well
[00:53:27] <jmaister> hm. this is annoying
[00:54:36] <Whirl3d> in your before/after images, what is the little gear icon and where does it load (maybe it's a sun)
[00:55:28] <jmaister> the gear/cog is actually hard coded in the html
[00:55:35] <jmaister> it's a menu button
[00:56:02] <Whirl3d> why is it sized differently in the two images (and positioned differently)
[00:56:07] <nisseni> Whirl3d: sorry for the late respons, not sure what you mean...
[00:56:25] <Whirl3d> is it coded into the #content div
[00:57:23] <jmaister> Whirl3d: It's resized as well with CSS. this is the html http://pastebin.com/hFuN7DTQ
[00:58:03] <jmaister> css: .settings img {height: 5%; }
[01:00:43] <jmaister> position is also relative to the size of parent container
[01:01:01] <jmaister> So I guess #content is the root of all evil here
[01:01:52] <Whirl3d> Try setting #content to an explicit height: Say 500px and then see if you can get the problem to happen
[01:04:49] <jmaister> hm. I found something interesting while debugging on the local browser: the board seems to have the same width as #content but in fact I didn't calculate the margins: http://cl.ly/1h0A3E1j1Y0h2M162804
[01:05:58] <jmaister> .content { padding: 0 10% 0 10%; } might explain it
[01:06:14] <NivenHuH> what would  cause something to not respond to a 'mousemove' binding?
[01:07:09] <NivenHuH> in my javascript debugger console, i'm doing $("body").mousemove(function(){console.log("test");});  and nothing happens when i'm moving my mouse around on the page
[01:10:57] <Whirl3d> NivenHuH, do you have stuff in your body?
[01:11:11] <NivenHuH> yeah
[01:11:26] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/2tU3d/2/
[01:11:28] <Whirl3d> works for me
[01:11:32] <NivenHuH> i am using flexible box model for positioning
[01:11:37] <NivenHuH> i'm not sure if that'll cause issues
[01:11:42] <nVee-YAM> I have a keyUp event which calls a $.post function. I need to stop all processes of the previous keyUP or ajax call should another keyUp happen, how do I do this?
[01:12:00] <nVee-YAM> what function should I use? and should I use it on the keyUp or the $.post?
[01:12:39] <Whirl3d> $.ajax
[01:12:44] <Whirl3d> ?.ajax
[01:13:00] <Whirl3d> doh! bot-t has abandoned us, drats.

[01:23:10] <Wiz_KeeD> if i have multiple matching pairs of divs with class 1 and 2, how do i make a slide-down slide-up on the second div, hovering over the first?
[01:24:55] <soee> hi, is it possible to do some action when ajax call is done?
[01:25:11] <Whirl3d> $(".class1").mouseover(function (e) {$(".class2").height()>0?$(".class2").slideUp("fast"):$(".class2").slideDown("fast");});
[01:25:44] <Whirl3d> soee, did you check the ajax api docs?
[01:26:01] <Whirl3d> it's pretty clearly outlined in the success callback in the docs
[01:27:06] <anli_> If two elements are side by side and I move the mouse from one object to another, will the mouseenter in obj 2 happen before mouseout in obj 1?
[01:27:58] <_johnny> hi, i'm trying to do a cross site (i control both (custom) https server and html+js) request with post data. it fails in handshaking (from https server output), and jquery ($.ajax) triggers error() with "error" as text. i'm fairly certain i had it working at one point last night, but even the revs around that time do not work anymore. any ideas?
[01:28:38] <soee> Whirl3d, to be more specific dont want to do this inside ejax call script, well i need to recognise if on page ajax call was made and than execute some action
[01:28:46] <_johnny> i've set crossDomain to true, i'm using POST, and would prefer not using withCredentials (if possible)
[01:31:48] <Wiz_KeeD> Whirl3d, was the first one for me?
[01:32:17] <jmaister> anyone tested jQ.Mobi? http://www.jqmobi.com/
[01:32:35] <NivenHuH> this is baffling.. the mouse move events are working in chrome, but not in safari
[01:34:06] <Wiz_KeeD> jmaister, thank you for showing me that link!
[01:34:34] <jmaister> np :)
[01:35:50] <Wiz_KeeD> Whirl3d, that code doesn't work
[01:36:08] <Wiz_KeeD> and by the way, will it solve the problem that there are multiple pairs and act on the one next to the div hovered over?
[01:36:38] <raj> how do i create a div around the inputbox in focus?
[01:36:41] <Whirl3d> Wiz_Keed, I'll answer you if you can tell me how long is a piece of string...
[01:37:04] <Wiz_KeeD> meaning that i didn't supply a reason why it doesn't work?
[01:37:20] <Whirl3d> you didn't supply hardly any information, to be honest
[01:37:30] <Whirl3d> ?paste
[01:37:30] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[01:39:58] <dnsdds> I'm using .submit() to manually trigger submitting a form. How can I send custom POST values with it?
[01:40:34] <Whirl3d> I am not sure why this happens, but it seems like some strange coincidence that suddenly 3 or four people have the same very particular kind of problem with the same basic starting point...it's almost as though people were trying to get homework done...though in the past, it hasn't been the case
[01:40:51] <Wiz_KeeD> ?
[01:41:19] <Whirl3d> you are at least the third person tonight with code that was 90% php and a tidbit of jquery thrown in for good measure.
[01:41:21] <leehambley> I'm using jQuery with Rails, and seeing this when I'm making an AJAX call: http://cl.ly/1X2Z2K31212N0Z1f0b2Q - the server responds in 210ms, which is acceptable, if not lightening fast… but why 4.5 seconds waiting on the client?
[01:42:15] <raj> answer is $.wrap() in case anyone was wondering
[01:42:52] <Whirl3d> Wiz_KeeD, I'm afraid that I have no idea what is going on with your code since I am barely versed in php at all.

[01:45:33] <Xotix> jquery ui 1.8.16 and 17. Has there been a difference in tabs somehow?
[01:45:48] <anli_> I want to append text to a textarea, the only way I can do is to get the old contents, concatenate and write back?
[01:46:02] <Whirl3d> $.append
[01:46:11] <Whirl3d> sry...wrong window
[01:46:11] <anli_> Oh, $.append does the same?
[01:46:15] <anli_> ah, ok
[01:46:26] <anli_> Cool, because it seemed relevant
[01:46:49] <Whirl3d> lol, I see that now.
[01:47:22] <Whirl3d> anli $("textarea").val($("textarea").val()+"sometext");
[01:47:30] <anli_> So the answer was "yes"
[01:47:36] <anli_> ;)
[01:47:38] <Whirl3d> basically.
[01:47:52] <anli_> Thats so odd, how large cannot those strings become
[01:48:05] <anli_> I also need to scroll down
[01:48:15] <anli_> But thats probably not so hard
[01:48:31] <anli_> first hit when googling
[01:49:55] <NivenHuH> my face wants to cry
[01:50:09] <NivenHuH> the stupid safari js debugger was screwed up.. closing and reopening it fixed my problem
[01:50:23] <anli_> Haha, "my face wants to cry", love it
[01:50:55] <slax> Anyone got time to help me get fullCalendar to render inside Colorbox?
[01:51:02] <Whirl3d> I thought you caught a glimpse of your face ina mirror...I was gonna say "Now you see how we feel when we see you"
[01:51:20] * Whirl3d grimaces
[01:51:47] <anli_> :)
[01:52:03] <Xotix> I'm experience not working tabs with juery ui 1.8.17, it worked wit 1.8.16. Anything known?
[01:52:05] <Whirl3d> slax, I wish that I had the focus to help you. But two plugins? I have a hard enough time with plugins in general. Good luck to you though.
[01:52:29] <Whirl3d> Xotix, did you check bug reports?
[01:52:57] <slax> Whirl3d, yeah i've been struggling with this for quite some time now tried all kinds of callbacks but so far nothing :(
[01:59:09] <Xotix> Whril3d, the bug is, the file is empty...
[01:59:31] <Xotix> But this is probably my fault ;)
[02:02:57] <Wiz_KeeD> Whirl3d, the conditions in the ternary operator or conditional operator as how other would say it is were inversed
[02:03:00] <Wiz_KeeD> that's why nothing happened
[02:03:37] <Wiz_KeeD> or the div allready has a certain height and didn't move
[02:04:42] <jmaister> Whirl3d: I finally solved it! I executed $("#content").height and width and css padding as the first thing in document ready, so the size was proper before drawing anything
[02:04:52] <jmaister> Whirl3d: Thanks a lot for taking the time :)
[02:05:25] <Whirl3d> Sorry I couldn't help more. Congrats on finding the solution.
[02:05:32] <jmaister> Thanks
[02:05:52] <mindis|wurk> errrm. anyone know how to get mouseenter events from an iframe on IE(9)? iframe.contents().find('body').on('mouseenter', 'a'...) works on firefox and chrome without problem
[02:08:26] <raj> How can I make $(this) a list item?
[02:08:43] <raj> basically, precede it with a <ul> and <li>
[02:08:53] <nFFF> .before()
[02:09:09] <raj> do I need .after('</ul>')?
[02:09:52] <nFFF> var me = jQuery(this);     me.html(me.html().replace(/^(\w+)/, '<li>$1</li>'));
[02:10:31] <raj> yeah, i was trying to avoid regex
[02:10:46] <nFFF> Why?
[02:10:52] <Whirl3d> var me=$(this); me.wrap("<li></li>").wrap("<ul></ul>");
[02:11:33] <raj> not very readable code
[02:11:40] <raj> ...referring to using regex
[02:11:52] <Whirl3d> or maybe $(this).wrap("<li></li>").parent().wrap("<ul></ul>");
[02:12:07] <Whirl3d> not sure if wrap changes the scope of $(this) to include the wrapper.
[02:12:50] <raj> it knows to put the first set of < > before and the second set of < > after?
[02:12:59] <Cork> Whirl3d: it doesn't
[02:13:43] <Cork> raj: you can shorten it as <li/> it still knows how to handle it
[02:13:51] <Cork> the html is parsed into a dom object
[02:14:01] <raj> k
[02:14:23] <Whirl3d> Cork, thanks. I wasn't sure if li was like textarea or not. ;8)
[02:14:42] <Cork> Whirl3d: "like textarea" ?
[02:14:52] <Xotix> How can a theme break the functionailty of tabs?
[02:14:55] <Whirl3d> lol. You can't autoclose textarea, I don't think.
[02:15:04] <Cork> Whirl3d: you can
[02:15:14] <Whirl3d> <textarea/> doesn't work
[02:15:17] <Whirl3d> does it?
[02:16:46] <raj> $(this).wrap('<div class="autocomplete_div" />').wrap("<ul></ul>");
[02:16:49] <raj> ul isn't showing up
[02:17:05] <raj> even if I do <ul/> instead
[02:17:35] <raj> if I do the <ul> wrap before the <div> wrap, it puts the ul outside the div, which isn't what I want
[02:17:49] <Whirl3d> I have been writing <textarea></textarea> for years because I was told that you couldn't auto close textarea. Cork, thanks for the info...
[02:17:56] <mindis|wurk> well shit. IE doesn't seem to care about ANY mouse events in my iframe
[02:18:50] <Cork> Whirl3d: hmm so it does
[02:19:07] <Cork> Whirl3d: not sure why though, might be cause textarea is a replaced element
[02:19:30] * Cork hates all the special rules around form elements...
[02:19:45] * Whirl3d hates css in general
[02:20:07] <Cork> except for the idioticy around form elements, css is quite good and consitent
[02:20:13] <Cork> what does you hate about it?
[02:20:24] <Cork> *what do
[02:20:40] <Whirl3d> I hate the position methods
[02:20:48] <Cork> ok?
[02:20:50] <mindis|wurk> i hate it because it or its implementation in all browsers is illogical. take vertical-align for example, it simply doesn't do anything right
[02:21:19] <Cork> mindis|wurk: vertical align only works for inline, inline-block or cell type elements
[02:21:24] <Whirl3d> And the fact that padding changes width but margins don't and sometimes you have to calculate padding and margin and sometimes you don't and floating messes all that up and then....
[02:21:55] <hurdos> Hello
[02:22:04] <Cork> Whirl3d: ya, the margin collapse is... a bit confusing
[02:22:04] <raj> ok, so any idea why this isn't working on line 44? http://paste.ofcode.org/ghpuxEvygVLM8GtwN6zALN or the live site (click on Company, and type the word John http://68.44.194.145:8080/asdf/edit-profile?section=occupation (login is asdf:asdf)
[02:22:20] <JKarsrud> mindis|wurk: ehm, vertical-align is kinda special... only works on the type of elements that Cork said
[02:23:14] <Cork> raj: at least us a pb that shows line numbers if you refer to them -_-'
[02:23:14] <Whirl3d> Oh, and if we are gonna complain about css...LOL. let's talk about alignment of elements...that's a pain in the arse bigger than jail. I mean wow.
[02:23:42] <raj> it does
[02:23:57] <Cork> Whirl3d: just make them inline and you fix most of it, but ya theres a lot of limitations there
[02:24:13] <fghh> hello, how can i do something like http://standards.webmasterpro.de/index-article-min_height.html with jQuery?
[02:24:25] <JKarsrud> Cork, that pb shows line numbers just fine? :)
[02:24:34] <Cork> Whirl3d: but thats not really a problem with css, its just that theres no option to make elements thats not children adjust to eachother
[02:24:43] <Cork> JKarsrud: not for me
[02:24:48] <JKarsrud> weird
[02:25:08] <Hooloovoork> fghh: uhm, why would you wanna set min height in jquery?
[02:25:21] <mindis|wurk> something like aligning text in the middle of a button both horizontally and vertically appears to be impossible. it keeps varying from one browser to another
[02:25:31] <raj> Cork, any ideas?
[02:25:47] <Cork> raj: i'm to lazy to sit and count rows
[02:25:53] <JKarsrud> mindis|wurk: well, if you know the height of the element, match the height? Or set it to display: table-cell; ?
[02:25:58] <raj> Cork, maybe refresh
[02:25:59] <Whirl3d> Cork, I am fully willing to admit that I am just too old to cozy up to CSS--it's my limitation more than anything. I admire your attitude, though.
[02:26:03] <raj> there are def line numbers! :)
[02:26:37] <mindis|wurk> JKarsrud match the height? you mean with line-height?
[02:26:42] <fghh> Hooloovoork, why not?
[02:26:53] <JKarsrud> mindis|wurk: yeah, match the line-height
[02:27:23] <JKarsrud> Cork: it's the line with .wrap()
[02:27:25] <JKarsrud> http://pastie.org/3200453
[02:27:30] <JKarsrud> I repasted it for you :D
[02:27:34] <JKarsrud> Now I have to work
[02:27:34] <mitrei> Hello, how to select many options in select?
[02:27:46] <Hooloovoork> fghh: well, if you wanna change it to have a min-height at some point it would be useful. setting it with javascript initially would just be stupid. Anyways. check out the .css() function of jquery. that one can do what you want.
[02:27:48] <mindis|wurk> JKarsrud yeah, tried it. produces...varying results
[02:28:14] <JKarsrud> I've never experienced varying results using that technique before..
[02:28:36] <JKarsrud> well, display: table-cell; might work tho
[02:28:45] <JKarsrud> it should work atleast ;)
[02:28:58] <xec> raj: you're wrapping a div in a ul? on purpose?
[02:29:05] <fghh> Hooloovoork, not initially..just at some point..
[02:29:14] <raj> no, I want the ul on the inside
[02:29:39] <xec> raj: thats not what .wrap does
[02:29:58] <raj> so other way around?
[02:30:03] <Cork> raj: the inside of what?
[02:30:12] <Hooloovoork> fghh: ahh then i suppose it's ok. i can't see any situation where you'd need to set min-height after a while on a page so that's why i complained. if you got a proper use for it tho setting it with .css() is fine.
[02:30:13] <Cork> you want to append it?
[02:30:36] <fghh> Hooloovoork, setting it with css won't do the trick
[02:30:42] <raj> basically, I want each line of item in data to be an <li>
[02:30:48] <fghh> Hooloovoork: i need something like 			obj.css({'min-height':h, 'height':'auto !important'});  			obj.css('height',h);
[02:30:54] <fghh> but it get's overwritten
[02:30:56] <raj> additionally, I'll have the textbox also as an <li>
[02:31:04] <Hooloovoork> fghh: if you wanna do the css trick you sent us it will be enough.
[02:31:24] <raj> and these should all sit in div called .autocomplete_div
[02:31:34] <mindis|wurk> is it okay to repeatedly add something.on('event', 'elm'...) ? it seems i need to add an event after the element is added in IE since merely calling .on once isn't enough for it
[02:31:41] <fghh> you can write box{min-height:500px;height:auto !important;height:500px      | but how in jQuery?
[02:31:51] <Cork> raj: and this is a list of li's or what?
[02:32:01] <raj> it's supposed to be
[02:32:26] <JKarsrud> mindis|wurk: do you use the live/delegate syntax for on?
[02:32:27] <fghh> Hooloovoork: you can write box{min-height:500px;height:auto !important;height:500px      | but how in jQuery?
[02:32:30] <Cork> raj: then you need to create the ul, append the lis
[02:32:30] <Hooloovoork> fghh: i just told you. just use .css() $(".box").css({"min-height": "500px", "somethingelse": "100px"}) etc
[02:32:35] <Cork> raj: then wrap the ul with the div
[02:32:45] <Cork> raj: else you will wrap each li with its own ul
[02:32:57] <JKarsrud> as in, do you bind from document, or from an element?
[02:33:16] <mindis|wurk> JKarsrud what's the difference? i just switched to replacing my live clicks with .on clicks since that was the recommendation for 1.7
[02:33:29] <raj> Cork, maybe try refreshing, I switched the ul and div wrapping
[02:33:29] <[E]sc> anyway to go back to previous page that was triggered using #anchor tag using jquery?
[02:33:31] <fghh> Hooloovoork: you don't understand me ;) i want to have height set to auto for normal browsers and height set to 500px for IE6 because height is like min-height for IE6
[02:33:59] <Cork> raj: if your doing it for each li, it won't work
[02:34:09] <Cork> you need to collect them in the ul
[02:34:20] <raj> Cork, what I thought I was doing here was wrapping the focused textbox with a ul and div
[02:34:36] <Hooloovoork> fghh: do a browsercheck
[02:34:39] <raj> and then appending each item in data with <li>
[02:34:44] <Hooloovoork> fghh: $.browser
[02:34:51] <Cork> raj: thats the problem, ul only acceps li's
[02:34:54] <raj> oh, should I be appending to the ul instead of the div?
[02:35:24] <JKarsrud> mindis|wurk: "live" binds events from the document; $(document).on('event', 'element', handler), but delegate binds from an element context $('elem').on('event', 'elem2', handler);
[02:35:30] <raj> Cork, aren't I only passing it li's now?
[02:35:32] <JKarsrud> might work differently
[02:35:56] <fghh> Hooloovoork: okay, that would work, thanks
[02:35:57] <Hooloovoork> fghh: another trick is to use !important. stuff with !important wont be read by IE6
[02:35:58] <Cork> raj: no your passing it "this" and its the $autocomplete_attribute element
[02:36:12] <Hooloovoork> fghh: just like in your example...
[02:36:17] <mindis|wurk> JKarsrud ah, well then i'm using delegate
[02:36:19] <Hooloovoork> it's dirty but it works
[02:36:39] <raj> oh, I thought wrap will wrap $(this) with a <ul>?
[02:36:50] <Cork> raj: exactly
[02:37:04] <Cork> $autocomplete_attribute.focus(function(e) { $(this).wrap('<div class="autocomplete_div" />').wrap("<ul></ul>"); });
[02:37:08] <mindis|wurk> JKarsrud but my main concern was that calling the 'same' .on over and over again might add some excess event handlers
[02:37:11] <raj> $(this) = the input box
[02:37:30] <Cork> and again, you can only have li's inside ul
[02:37:32] <JKarsrud> mindis|wurk: I'm not sure if they might overwrite the ones set earlier
[02:37:42] <Cork> not divs or input
[02:37:45] <raj> but I want the input box to have an <li> as well
[02:38:04] <Cork> then you need to first wrap the input with an li
[02:38:05] <raj> like, can't the input box be a list item?
[02:39:12] <raj> Cork, k, check it out
[02:39:29] <raj> $(this).wrap("<li/>").wrap("<ul/>").wrap('<div class="autocomplete_div" />'); is going from outside in, not inside out
[02:39:36] <mindis|wurk> now i could almost say my stuff works in IE...except i have no idea why IE suddenly decided it can't do box-shadow or border-radius
[02:39:40] <Cork> wrong order
[02:39:54] <raj> oh, that's what I thought
[02:40:34] <Cork> raj: its prob simpler to create the elements you want and append it instead
[02:40:37] <mitrei> help me please, how to select many options in select?
[02:41:17] <raj> Cork, which element am I not creating?
[02:42:09] <raj> ok, check it out, <ul> is no where in site
[02:42:20] <raj> somehow it doesn't show up
[02:42:23] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/9Fa2c/
[02:42:44] <raj> the div shows up, the li shows up, but there's no ul
[02:42:54] <raj> oh, can I have a ul within another ul?
[02:43:12] <Cork> no you can have ul within an li withing an other ul
[02:43:52] <raj> k, then any idea why it's not showing in fb?
[02:44:02] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/9Fa2c/
[02:45:18] <mindis|wurk> here's another odd puzzle: i'm triggering a popup from my iframes, but when i use event.windowX to determinate the correct horizontal position for the popup, it returns an entirely wrong position
[02:45:48] <mindis|wurk> it seems to be close to the middle of the frame instead of the left edge where the event takes place
[02:46:00] <raj> Cork, k, I'll try that
[02:46:19] <raj> but any idea why the <ul> tag is missing on my live site?
[02:47:33] <Cork> when you do wrap multible times its really easy to make mistakes, cause it becomes hard to follow really quickly
[02:47:47] <raj> for the computer?
[02:47:52] <raj> :)
[02:47:58] <raj> i'm doing $(this).wrap('<div class="autocomplete_div" />').wrap("<ul/>").wrap("<li/>");
[02:48:00] <Cork> no for the developer
[02:48:11] <raj> that seems straight forward
[02:48:15] <Cork> raj: again, thats the wrong order
[02:48:37] <Cork> that would be <li><ul><div><input>
[02:48:37] <raj> that's the exact opposite order of last time you told me wrong order
[02:49:10] <Cork> oh wait, sorry, no its the correct order
[02:49:26] <Cork> and thats exactly why its a bad idea ;P
[02:50:03] <raj> ok, fair enough...but why doesn't it work?
[02:50:10] <raj> where's the <ul> disappearing to?
[02:50:35] <Cork> raj: it works in my jsfiddle, so its something with how your doing it
[02:50:42] <Cork> raj: what browser?
[02:50:59] <raj> ff
[02:52:08] <Cork> raj: this works for me http://jsfiddle.net/6wcJ5/
[02:52:30] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/6wcJ5/1/
[02:53:41] <raj> yeah, I see it there
[02:54:10] <sak> can anyone tell me about browser compatilbily in jquery?
[02:54:28] <sak> am not able to view the images properly in IE 7!
[02:54:31] <raj> Cork, so what's wrong with my live site?
[02:54:34] <raj> :T
[02:54:46] <Cork> sak: you need to be a be a lot more specific then that
[02:55:01] <Cork> raj: try reproduce the problem in jsfiddle or jsbin
[02:55:16] <raj> it doesn't reproduce...you just proved that
[02:55:30] <Cork> no its far from the same kind of code
[02:55:48] <Cork> its just a fraction of it, without the same structure
[02:55:59] <sak> actually we are designing a website.. under nivo slider there are 3 slides whn i open it in IE the images look overlapped but in chrome its ok!
[02:56:07] <sak> any code to be added in jquery!
[02:56:08] <stanman246> hi i have a form with multiple inputs having id's and names like this: weeklist[2012-01-01][38]. The formats are weeklist[date][id]. Now i want to compute the totals of the inputs' values. Something like getting all weeklist[2012-01-01][..] fields and weeklist[...][38] fields. can't get it right. how do i get all weeklist[2012-01-01][...] values?
[02:56:13] <sak> for compatibily!
[02:56:34] <Cork> sak: you mean <img> ?
[02:56:40] <sak> cork : pls assist!
[02:56:42] <Cork> your leaving out way way WAY to much info
[02:56:52] <raj> Cork, but how can I reproduce all my code in there?
[02:57:03] <Cork> raj: not all the code
[02:57:18] <soee> i have some tiv with text placed in my page, is it possible to move this div to center of the page, add some border etc show it there for 5 seconds and move again to original place ?
[02:57:29] <Cork> raj: you need to reproduce the relevant part of the html, and a faked part of the ajax call and all that
[02:57:45] <Cork> how its loops and what it does is prob what causes it to fail in your page
[02:58:12] <Cork> stanman246: use class names
[02:58:21] <Cork> stanman246: you can't really do a mass id selection
[02:58:45] <stanman246> aahhh.... righto! thanks for pointing!
[02:58:48] <Cork> stanman246: you can somewhat select on the name though
[02:59:03] <stanman246> the id is the same as the names
[02:59:48] <Cork> stanman246: $('input[name^="weeklist[2012-01-01]"]')
[03:00:02] <stanman246> ok
[03:00:06] <Cork> stanman246: ya, but you can't use them in a range selection
[03:00:24] <Cork> you can select on attributes though (and you can look after id's as attributes)
[03:00:34] <stanman246> how do i get the weeklist[...][49]-ers?
[03:00:40] <Cork> you can't
[03:00:48] <stanman246> hmm...
[03:00:51] <Cork> you need to loop over them and compare the field
[03:01:50] <stanman246> so i can get the weeklist[2012-01-02][..] fields and totalize them. and for the weeklist[...][39] i could use classnames
[03:02:07] <stanman246> then i can create 2 different arrays
[03:03:58] <Cork> stanman246: something like this: $('input[name^="weeklist"]').map(function(elm){ if(/weeklist\[[0-9]+\]\[49\]/.match(elm.name)) { return elm; } });
[03:04:15] <Cork> stanman246: though thats a terrible selector, and you should REALLY be using a class instead
[03:05:25] <stanman246> thanks, i will use a class for the weeklist[...][38] inputs and get the weeklist[2012-01-01][..] inputs with the regex.
[03:11:01] <raj> Cork, not sure why it's not working http://jsfiddle.net/Dut4D/
[03:15:09] <soc42> hi #jquery
[03:15:13] <soc42> is there a way to provide different print-links using different <div>s for each?
[03:16:06] <Garrick> create a new element for each print link
[03:17:43] <soc42> can i do something like <div id="print-div-one">...</div> and within jquery do: $('#print-link-one').print() ?
[03:17:49] <soee> how can i animate position change of div ?
[03:18:09] <Garrick> sure.. depends on what you want print to do though.
[03:18:40] <Garrick> but if you have multiple div print links.. i suggest creating a class for them.
[03:18:58] <Garrick> $('div.print-link').print(); where print should handle array of elements.
[03:19:28] <soc42> yes, i have to put some print links with different printable areas
[03:19:28] <Garrick> unless your elements are all different, then you'll need a different solution..
[03:24:06] * Armonz autoaway after 60 minutes!
[03:28:47] <oal> Any ideas how I'd constrain a draggable inside a circle?
[03:31:09] <Xotix> hi
[03:31:39] <Garrick> oal corrdinates comparison?
[03:32:25] <oal> I can just calculate it, but if there was just to set one of the options, I'd prefer that.
[03:32:35] <Whirl3d> if you know the center point/radius of the circle, you can check the coordinates of the draggable and easily tell if it is within the circle
[03:33:16] <JKarsrud> oal: it's not one of the predefined options afaik, so coordinate comparison is the way to go
[03:33:24] <JKarsrud> trying to make google + circles, eh?
[03:33:36] <oal> Nope, a color picker widget
[03:33:38] <soc42> hey Garrick, i want to use .bind('click') for the print links, so how should the html <a href... look like?
[03:34:09] <Garrick> soc42: that would be up to you.. the bind click really doesn't matter to how the href is structured.
[03:34:21] <soc42> i tried something like  <a id="print-likn" href="#" onclick="return false;">print</a>
[03:34:30] <soc42> but that didn't seem to work?
[03:34:36] <Garrick> i suggest unobtrusive.
[03:34:53] <Garrick> you're most likely going to need to preventDefault in your click event.
[03:35:03] <ravenzz> soc42 add it in javascript
[03:35:05] <Garrick> not the inline onclick attribute.
[03:35:31] <JKarsrud> oal: ah, ok :)
[03:35:46] <ravenzz> soc42 with js disabled or not working it won't make sense
[03:36:08] <Garrick> oal: i'd go with Whirl3d, if you know the radius.
[03:36:13] <soc42> ravenzz, thank you, but that's no problem for this site
[03:36:43] <ravenzz> soc42 it could be the problem for any site
[03:37:08] <Garrick> soc42: what are you trying to accomplish?
[03:37:24] <oal> Garrick: hmm, never heard of. Could you explain?
[03:37:31] <soc42> ravenzz: why do you think so?
[03:37:54] <Garrick> oal: Whirl3d, the person who suggested the radius solution..
[03:37:55] <ravenzz> soc42 because having JS enabled is not opt to you but to the user
[03:38:31] <Garrick> ravenzz, it could be possible that what soc42 is working on is JS dependent.
[03:38:54] <jarr0dsz> hey everyone im trying to combine a function in a function without any real success
[03:38:54] <oal> Garrick: haha, sorry, didn't notice his name. I thought it was a plugin or something.
[03:38:55] <jarr0dsz> http://pastie.org/3200790
[03:39:04] <Garrick> oal: i know. :)
[03:39:05] <jarr0dsz> any jquery guru can point me on how to combine the functions?
[03:39:22] <jarr0dsz> since i have an onclick event in my html so i need to just execute it when i click, now i have to click 2x
[03:39:47] <ravenzz> Garrick, soc42 with JS disabled this doesn't make sense http://jsfiddle.net/zTBme/
[03:40:00] <soc42> ravenzz: i respect the users decisions. but the application can only be accessed with js enabled, so if you want to use the application, you simply just have to enable it. it's (not my) policy
[03:40:07] <xec> jarr0dsz: i'm not entirely sure what the issue is, what happens and what did you expect?
[03:40:17] <Garrick> ravenzz: like i said.. soc42 could be working on something that is JS dependent.
[03:40:23] <ravenzz> k
[03:40:35] <xec> jarr0dsz: and why is this inside a function?
[03:40:36] <ravenzz> so add it in your markup then
[03:40:37] <Garrick> so his use case is that js is required.
[03:40:43] <jarr0dsz> i call the function onclick on a div, and it needs to execute then. currently you have to click 2x times
[03:41:03] <jarr0dsz> i mean the function imToggle(){ and the     $("#imall").delegate(".im", "click", function(e) {
[03:41:07] <xec> jarr0dsz: as in html onclick="" ?
[03:41:12] <Garrick> jarr0dsz: can you comebine the onclick on the div with the imToggle function?
[03:41:13] <jarr0dsz> xec: yes
[03:41:16] <Garrick> comebine
[03:41:19] <Garrick> doh. combine
[03:41:19] <xec> jarr0dsz: you don't need that
[03:41:34] <jarr0dsz> xec: i now it should work otherwise but it does not for some reason..
[03:41:45] <jarr0dsz> i had it look at the dom first
[03:41:45] <xec> jarr0dsz: the .on() binds events, not unlike onclick=""
[03:42:21] <jarr0dsz> i tried it on jfiddle it works fine there same html same css same jquery version
[03:42:22] <jarr0dsz> http://pastie.org/3200799
[03:42:27] <Garrick> go with the unobtrusive route by adding events via .on, .live, or .delegate
[03:42:39] <jarr0dsz> this is what work there but somehow in won't work in my application
[03:42:49] <Garrick> jarr0dsz: whats your html look like?
[03:42:54] <jarr0dsz> im adding this to a php application everything is exactly the same still it doesent work
[03:43:28] <jarr0dsz> Garrick: this is my html http://pastie.org/private/3d5jzbku9g8of1jny3vzhw
[03:43:45] <jarr0dsz> thats the *new html
[03:43:46] <Garrick> ok, so this is what it's doing.
[03:44:04] <jarr0dsz> without the onclicks is the old code wich i cannot get to work with the 2nd jquery pastie ( without the imToggle function around it )
[03:44:22] <Garrick> ok. looking.
[03:45:19] <xec> jarr0dsz: does this help? http://jsfiddle.net/bnRur/
[03:45:21] <jarr0dsz> this is not working http://pastie.org/private/3d5jzbku9g8of1jny3vzhw
[03:45:33] <jarr0dsz> that html with that js and i really want to understand and learn why since i dont see it
[03:45:54] <soee> can i do some action on element created by ajax call ?
[03:46:03] <soee> so new element in dom
[03:46:17] <jarr0dsz> ah damn that works
[03:46:18] <ravenzz> jarr0dsz http://jsfiddle.net/9mMb4/ :?
[03:46:21] <Garrick> jarr0dsz: so, $(fnc) basically means the fnc is to be executed on domready.
[03:46:24] <jarr0dsz> xec: thx that seems to work
[03:46:32] <jarr0dsz> so i missed the domready part ? arghh how stupid...
[03:46:42] <xec> jarr0dsz: that could be it
[03:46:44] <jarr0dsz> i dont do jquery that often say once in a few months.
[03:46:47] <soc42> well, the print link doesn't seem to work? see http://jsfiddle.net/fzX6B/
[03:46:48] <raj> what's wrong with the syntax here? $(this).wrap("<div class='autocomplete_div' />")
[03:46:54] <jarr0dsz> seems like it runs fine now in my app also big thx searched long time for this
[03:46:58] <Garrick> it's grabbing the div#imall, delegating the clicks.
[03:47:00] <raj> the quotes perhaps
[03:47:05] <xec> jarr0dsz: you could also include your script at the end of your html structure
[03:47:16] <ravenzz> soc42 you should window.print();
[03:47:54] <Garrick> raj maybe the close tags?
[03:47:55] <soc42> i just want to print a particular div section
[03:48:01] <MoneY> do you support the jq mobile application too?
[03:48:01] <Garrick> err. close tag
[03:48:03] <ravenzz> soc42 you will able to print just the #help section using print stylesheets
[03:48:05] <soc42> it's not about printing the whole page
[03:48:06] <raj> Garrick, should it be </div>?
[03:48:50] <ravenzz> soc42 http://www.alistapart.com/articles/goingtoprint/
[03:49:31] <Garrick> raj: $(this).wrap('<div></div>');
[03:49:35] <jarr0dsz> xec: yes but thats would not be best practice right? or is it faster load time on page
[03:49:38] <Garrick> so yeah.
[03:49:50] <raj> Garrick, and with the class?
[03:50:01] <raj> quotes are fine like $(this).wrap('<div class="autocomplete_div"></div>')
[03:50:07] <Garrick> yes.
[03:50:13] <raj> yeah, still doesn't work
[03:50:16] <Garrick> if you HAVE to use double quotes.. then remember to escape them.
[03:50:31] <raj> i am using double quotes
[03:50:33] <xec> jarr0dsz: either way works, and performace difference is minimal
[03:50:41] <ravenzz> raj that is correcct
[03:50:50] <soc42> hey ravenzz, see http://jsfiddle.net/fzX6B/1/
[03:51:03] <xec> jarr0dsz: i prefer the document ready personally
[03:51:14] <Garrick> raj: works for me.. http://jsfiddle.net/garrickcheung/bnRur/1/
[03:51:30] <Garrick> check the html in your console
[03:51:48] <raj> that's what I'm doing
[03:51:49] <ravenzz> raj $(this).wrap($('<div/>').addClass('autocomplete_div')); should work too
[03:52:15] <ravenzz> soc42 i told you
[03:52:45] <jarr0dsz> xec: looks cleaner to me to ill stick with that
[03:52:49] <Garrick> ravenzz: it adds the autocomplete_div class to "this", which I don't think is what raj wants.
[03:53:44] <ravenzz> Garrick i don't think so http://jsfiddle.net/bnRur/2/
[03:54:44] <Garrick> oops, i see what I did there.
[03:54:55] <Garrick> i stand corrected.
[03:55:20] <Garrick> but on that note, I'm out. good night.
[03:55:23] <raj> ok, well, the whole line is $(this).wrap('<div class="autocomplete_div"></div>').wrap("<ul />").wrap("<li />");
[03:55:34] <ravenzz> night
[03:55:39] <raj> goodnight
[03:55:41] <ravenzz> soc42 eg. http://jsfiddle.net/fzX6B/4/
[03:56:09] <raj> but when I include the .wrap('<div class="autocomplete_div"></div>') line, the <ul> tag doesn't get created
[03:56:27] <raj> if I remove that part of the line, the <ul> tag is created fine
[03:56:33] <raj> ...li is created in both situations
[03:56:56] <ravenzz> wrap div li ul
[03:57:02] <ravenzz> should be the correct order
[03:57:06] <raj> really??
[03:57:07] <soc42> ravenzz: so i just to need to dynamically set the display-property for the sections to print or exclude from printing, right?
[03:57:08] <raj> why?
[03:57:35] <ravenzz> because it will wrap $(this) in a div then in a li and then in a ul
[03:57:57] <raj> no, I want the ul in the div
[03:58:18] <ravenzz> soc42 yep you should generate the print style dinamically
[03:58:28] <ravenzz> and append it (replace) to the head
[03:58:53] <ravenzz> you could start from some CSS print boilerplate i guess
[03:59:12] <ravenzz> soc42 look at the html5boilerplate one
[04:01:00] <ravenzz> raj http://jsfiddle.net/bnRur/3/ ?
[04:01:58] <ravenzz> oh sorry you don't need the $()
[04:02:06] <ravenzz> gotta go bbl
[04:02:18] <raj> kk
[04:02:25] <raj> thanks for looking
[04:07:00] <Assid> can someone please help me with jqueryui date picker.. i am unable to use setDate, any working example with yy-mm-dd would be helpful
[04:09:14] <Kingsy> I have some javascript like this --> imageBtnClose: '../images/lightbox/closelabel.gif', in a function... but in my browser its appearing as a deadlink.. I have made certain that the path is correct via a terminal.. is there a way og debugging something like this? to see what path its actually seeing?
[04:10:11] <leehambley> Kingsy: see #html
[04:10:33] <Kingsy> leehambley: really? I would have thought you would have to debug this in js
[04:10:47] <jarr0dsz> ah jquery is actually quite cool :P if you know what you do else its hardd ;p
[04:10:57] <leehambley> you don't know how HTML paths work, so #html will help you
[04:11:09] <jarr0dsz>     $("#imall").delegate(".im", "click", function(e) { i have that line, and trying to hide a certain div
[04:11:14] <leehambley> the path isn't relative to the JS, it's relative to the page displaying everything, and using relative paths n HTML is almost always a bad idea
[04:11:41] <jarr0dsz>           $(this).toggleClass("expanded collapsed"); toggles the whole class say i want to hide a certain class
[04:11:45] <Kingsy> leehambley|food: ahhh lol thanks
[04:11:57] <jarr0dsz> at the same time could i use something like closest to determine the closest element?
[04:13:26] <Cork> jarr0dsz: you mean filter out the element with the class thats a parent of a specific element?
[04:13:48] <jarr0dsz> im making a jsfiddle of it to learn also just asking brings me nowhere but some help would be great
[04:13:58] <jarr0dsz> the jquery terms are not yet fully layed down in my head ;p
[04:16:07] <raj> does $('mydiv').empty() remove any <ul> and <li> tags within a div?
[04:16:55] <Cork> raj: empty() does the same thing as innerHTML = ''
[04:17:24] <raj> so yes, removes everything from within, including tags?
[04:17:30] <jarr0dsz> i try to hide a certain class when a toggle is done with something like this Cork http://pastie.org/3200935
[04:17:34] <raj> cuz that explains all my issues
[04:17:56] <jarr0dsz> i assume thats correct and i only need a show hide class now to make that class be visible or invisible right
[04:18:36] <jarr0dsz>           $(".collapsed_content").toggleClass("show hide");
[04:18:36] <jarr0dsz>  would be a better naming
[04:20:14] <Cork> raj: it removes everything thats a child element of the selected element
[04:20:24] <raj> aah, gotcha
[04:20:26] <Cork> raj: there is no way to "just remove the text" in dom
[04:20:28] <raj> thank you Cork
[04:23:21] <jarr0dsz> ok nice all works now
[04:23:33] <jarr0dsz> i have only one problem is it possible to find the "parent" element somehow?
[04:23:38] <jarr0dsz> i have this http://pastie.org/3200935
[04:23:52] <xec> ?closest @ jarr0dsz
[04:23:53] <bot-t> jarr0dsz, .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[04:24:14] <jarr0dsz> the #im_col1 triggers the action now only problem is i dont want to toggle the #im_col1 but another div instead
[04:25:14] <xec> yeah, closest should work, or .parent() if you're certain your html structure will never change
[04:26:29] <jarr0dsz> sex something like this http://pastie.org/3200935 ? only that does nothing
[04:26:44] <xec> hehe
[04:28:03] <jarr0dsz> missed the dot i think         $.closest(".collapsed.im").toggleClass("expanded collapsed");
[04:28:17] <jarr0dsz> its very cool only hard to tie all ends together guess i need more jquery coding
[04:28:22] <xec> it's a three letter nick, why does it so consistenly confuse people
[04:28:42] <xec> jarr0dsz: $(this).closest(...)
[04:28:47] <JKarsrud> jarr0dsz: closest() works off a collection, not jQuery itself
[04:29:44] <jarr0dsz> ah okay that seems to somewhat work
[04:30:40] <jarr0dsz> i see i overlooked something, the #im_col1 isent available in expanded div state could i use say an if statement to check in what state i am and use closest on a variable div ?
[04:30:57] <JKarsrud> whut?
[04:31:53] <xec> jarr0dsz: could you make a demo at jsfiddle.net with the html, maybe easier to understand what you mean
[04:32:16] <Cork> jarr0dsz: uh, your looking for closers #im_col1 ?
[04:32:21] <Cork> *closest
[04:32:57] <jarr0dsz> this seem to work http://jsfiddle.net/qFpU5/1/
[04:33:21] <jarr0dsz> thats only the js. but with this setup i can not close the expaned box since there is no #im_col1 in the expanded html visible
[04:33:29] <xec> jarr0dsz: there's no html there
[04:33:40] <jarr0dsz> xec: not yet i add it in a second
[04:34:43] <soc42> well, i need more support on the print div problem... why does adding this css to 'head' does not seem to work? see: http://jsfiddle.net/fzX6B/6/
[04:34:45] <jarr0dsz> its rather a lot of html and css from several sources not easy to copy over
[04:37:53] <MoneY> hey, is the support for jquerymobile also here?
[04:38:07] <jarr0dsz> i think i have it sorted out :)
[04:38:48] <jarr0dsz> say you have a few blocks of collapsed boxes next to each other, and you want to expand each box but, you want to expand all below the other boxes. does that make sense?
[04:40:49] <scratcha> can anyone see why line #2 isn't getting the alt value of the html on line 7? http://pastie.org/3201008
[04:41:01] <jarr0dsz> for example http://jsfiddle.net/qFpU5/2/ each box will expand in between the other boxes
[04:41:08] <jarr0dsz> is there some methods in jquery to position them elsewhere?
[04:41:32] <jarr0dsz> or perhaps add them to another div thats positioned below the "boxes"
[04:43:09] <MoneY> scratcha use $(this).attr('alt');
[04:43:27] <soc42> hey ravenzz: what do you think about this version? http://jsfiddle.net/fzX6B/6/
[04:43:47] <soc42> ravenzz: i think it's close... but not yet working ;o(
[04:44:18] <scratcha> thanks MoneY
[04:44:29] <MoneY> scratcha works ? np
[04:44:51] <scratcha> works yeh
[04:44:53] <scratcha> nice one
[04:45:07] <MoneY> scratcha np "e" refers to event (click)
[04:47:59] <Wiz_KeeD> if i have $('#element').mouseover(function(){ how do i call div with class "x" that is a child of this element currently in use   });
[04:48:00] <Wiz_KeeD> ?
[04:50:52] <klusias> Wiz_KeeD, $('#element .x')
[04:52:02] <dw> Wiz_KeeD: alternatively, $('.x', this) from inside the mouseover handler
[04:55:00] <jarr0dsz> anyone sees an error in here: http://pastie.org/private/3d5jzbku9g8of1jny3vzhw
[04:55:11] <jarr0dsz> i try to change the class, just an alert when the .close class is clicked works
[04:55:50] <g[r]eek> Hi guys. Pardon if this is a noob question. I'm trying to get a fancybox running. I've included the jquery and fancybox libraries in my <head> in both my homepage (index.php) and my fancybox popup page (signup.php) - I've now got a link on my homepage to signup.php - how do I make it open up in a fancybox?
[05:00:14] <MoneY> jarr0dsz are you sure the element is known to jq? please try "console.log(this)" after line 8
[05:00:34] <g[r]eek> Perhaps someone can help walk me through this step-by-step tut? I'm stuck on step 4 - http://fancybox.net/howto
[05:15:03] <Remon> I have a problem that i would like to solve with jquery but i dont know if this is possible: my webmail is based on my clients domeinname so i would like a form where they type in their domain and get redirected to: mail.thedomain.com/roundcube is there a nice way of doing this in jqeury?
[05:16:29] <dabear_> Remon: sure? to redirect to another page, use window.location.href = "http://yoursite.com/foo.bar";
[05:17:18] <dabear_> you can use a textbox and and get the value from that box and conditionally redirect based on that value
[05:17:20] <Remon> dabear_: mmh, but this is a static address right?
[05:17:34] <Remon> ooh
[05:17:59] <dabear_> Remon: see ?submit
[05:18:00] <bot-t> Remon, .submit(handler): Bind an event handler to the "submit" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/submit/
[05:18:11] <dabear_> and also ?val
[05:18:17] <dabear_> see ?val
[05:18:18] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[05:18:34] <dabear_> so $("#textboxid").val() will get you that value
[05:18:58] <Remon> awesome, i am a big noob at all this so this helped alot :P
[05:19:48] <dabear_> ?mdc window.location @ Remon
[05:19:49] <bot-t> Remon, window.location - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a Location object , which contains information about the URL of the document and provides methods for changing that URL. You can also assign to this property to load another URL. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[05:25:41] <jarr0dsz> argh still working on jquery ;p
[05:25:54] <jarr0dsz>             $(".collapsed_content").removeClass("hide");  i need something like closest but that doesent seem to work
[05:26:06] <jarr0dsz> that line works but it removes all classes from all divs
[05:26:09] <FinalAngel> how can i bind multiple resize events to $(window) and remove them independently? like $(window).bind('resize.one')… $(window).bind('resize.two') and than $(window).unbind('resize.one')?
[05:26:14] <jarr0dsz> what would be the right syntax?
[05:26:20] <rue> jarr0dsz: You have a .hide class?
[05:26:34] <jarr0dsz> yes that class is added and removed with the jquery
[05:26:51] <jarr0dsz> FinalAngel: that could be something for later maybe im now just tryign to make it work
[05:27:05] <rue> Rather than just show()/hide()? I'm not too familiar with the usual idioms
[05:27:09] <rue> If this is one
[05:27:21] <FinalAngel> jarr0dsz: that was a general question from my side ;)
[05:27:25] <Assid> can someone help me with jquery ui , i am unable to use datepicker setDate, if someone can just put up a dummy page with that working. it would be appreciated
[05:27:37] <Assid> i am also using yy-mm-dd
[05:27:54] <rue> jarr0dsz: Is .collapsed_content the class of the container?
[05:28:11] <jarr0dsz> yes i think so
[05:28:41] <anli_> Is it possible to specify a background-position that puts the background image 5 pixels to the right side of the element?
[05:28:42] <jarr0dsz> this http://pastie.org/private/eos0hgoai80zjceuhq0oqg
[05:28:42] <jarr0dsz> works
[05:29:01] <jarr0dsz> only line 10, removes all the hide classes i only need it to remove the current one
[05:29:02] <anli_> I mean that the margin to the right edge should be 5px
[05:30:08] <jarr0dsz> rue: .close is inside the expanded_content i need to alter the collapsed_content div instead though
[05:30:18] <jarr0dsz> i need to find the closest collapsed_content div available
[05:30:59] <rue> The selector returns all of them
[05:31:04] <rue> If you have multiple
[05:31:50] <Famic> hi
[05:32:13] <Famic> anyone would know of a good plugin to have a pop-in image gallery with thumbnails by any chance ?
[05:32:38] <jarr0dsz> rue  is there a way to find the closest one?
[05:32:46] <jarr0dsz> $this is only referring to the current div right?
[05:32:54] <jarr0dsz> everything a child of it
[05:33:14] <jarr0dsz> so instead of             $(".collapsed_content").removeClass("hide");
[05:33:33] <jarr0dsz> is there some method to determine the first div named x?
[05:34:54] <Andres_> hello
[05:35:04] <Famic> jarr0dsz: tried about .first() ?
[05:35:07] <rue> .filter(:first) maybe?
[05:35:11] <rue> Or that :)
[05:35:16] <jarr0dsz> first no havent tried that
[05:36:38] <jarr0dsz> first grabbs the very first of an element if i get the docs correctly
[05:36:49] <jarr0dsz> that woudent be a solution neither
[05:37:23] <Famic> jarr0dsz: what are you trying to do ?
[05:37:45] <jarr0dsz> well i have boxes like [1][2][3] that i can expand
[05:38:07] <jarr0dsz> now when when expanded i hide some contents that should only be visible when collapsed ( say the 1,2,3 for example) those are in a div i hide
[05:38:13] <juboba> I would like to use fadeOut with a function callback and a parameter for that function, i.e. $("#myobject").fadeOut("slow", my_function(myvariable));
[05:38:14] <juboba> is this possible?
[05:38:14] <Andres_> Excuse me for barging in like this but how can I ask for help?
[05:38:51] <Cork> ?ask @ Andres_
[05:38:52] <bot-t> Andres_, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:39:04] <jarr0dsz> in short: i remove a class from inside a div, it should only remove there but it removes everwhere
[05:39:07] <Andres_> oh ok cool
[05:39:07] <jarr0dsz> a bit hard to explain
[05:39:13] <Andres_> file:///D:/sites/bigoom/pr.html
[05:39:15] <Andres_> oops
[05:39:23] <Andres_> http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/pr.html
[05:39:25] <Andres_> here
[05:39:32] <Andres_> I am trying to do a simple thing
[05:39:43] <Andres_> attach some canvases to some divs
[05:39:48] <Andres_> do some operations,
[05:39:52] <Andres_> remove the canvases
[05:39:56] <Andres_> and attach an image
[05:40:03] <Andres_> it's been two days
[05:40:06] <Famic> Andres_: make a sentence, don't spam
[05:40:08] <Andres_> trying to figure out WHY
[05:40:19] <Cork> Andres_: don't use xhtml doctype if your sending html
[05:40:31] <Cork> use <!doctype html>
[05:40:38] <rue> jarr0dsz: You're within the div from which you're trying to remove it? Then you'd look for the parent
[05:40:39] <Andres_> ok I'll change that
[05:40:46] <Andres_> hang on
[05:40:53] <jarr0dsz> rue no im inside another div thats the problem :(
[05:40:59] <Andres_> problem is that everything gets attached to the second div
[05:41:17] <Andres_> it's easier if you firebug it
[05:41:17] <rue> jarr0dsz: There must be some way to know which one you want. How are they related?
[05:41:32] <Andres_> I'll change doctype immediately
[05:41:34] <Famic> jarr0dsz: that's a bit hard to figure out your thing, do you have a link ?
[05:41:34] <jarr0dsz> rue:  i post the html one sec else its undoable to explain
[05:41:42] <trufoi> hi
[05:41:57] <trufoi> is getJson not possible with a https url?
[05:42:05] <rue> jarr0dsz: jsfiddle
[05:42:17] <rue> If possible to reduce
[05:42:28] <Andres_> Ok, doctype changed as advised @Cork
[05:43:09] <mantas322> can someone attempt to give me a legitimate explanation as to why using cold fusion and jquery together turns my application pain stakingly slow?
[05:43:20] <mantas322> inb4 "LOL you're using cold fusion"
[05:43:24] <Cork> Andres_: as far as i can see you never loop the selected elements
[05:43:42] <Cork> you just loop the generated images
[05:43:57] <Andres_> you mean by using this.each(function(){})?
[05:44:05] <Cork> yes
[05:44:05] <Famic> anyone would know of a good plugin to make a pop-in image gallery with thumbnails ?
[05:44:10] <Andres_> tried that already
[05:44:13] <Andres_> sec...
[05:44:24] <mantas322> simple page gets xml from a database, takes xml into cf variable- does a bunch of regex operations on it, then displays the variable to the screen
[05:44:29] <Cork> andornaut: cause thats where you will get the selections
[05:44:31] <Cork> opps
[05:44:33] <Cork> *Andres_
[05:44:42] <mantas322> without jquery takes les then a second, WITH jquery takes more then 2 minutes
[05:44:50] <jarr0dsz> rue: its not complete its very hard to get all the js css etc out of there but this is bascially the raw structutre : http://jsfiddle.net/V3KVg/ in html section
[05:44:52] <mantas322> what is the reason for this HUGH difference in operation
[05:45:01] <jarr0dsz> the close class i styled so you can click it
[05:45:03] <mantas322> someone beep me if you have any thoughts on the matter
[05:45:13] <jarr0dsz> so .close triggers the closure, i add the js to it also
[05:45:24] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/V3KVg/1/
[05:45:32] <rue> mantas322: What are you doing with jquery?
[05:45:47] <jarr0dsz> $close... {
[05:45:48] <jarr0dsz>             $(".collapsed_content").removeClass("hide");
[05:45:56] <mantas322> navigation for a mobile website
[05:46:00] <jarr0dsz> is causing the issues, its removing the div hide from all of the divs
[05:46:03] <mantas322> so nothing really,
[05:46:39] <Andres_> @Cork -> Here's an older version with iteration across elements : http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/jqt.html
[05:46:43] <aQute> i have a javascript function in that i am getting some data throught ajax how to return that data through parent function ?
[05:46:50] <mantas322> I think my superior has plans on using phonegap to magically turn this coldfusion/jquery hyrbit web app into mobile apps for all the mobile devices
[05:46:51] <Famic> jarr0dsz: are they always one after the other like that ?
[05:47:00] <Xotix> Has someone used fancybox with dynamically content yet?
[05:47:20] <jarr0dsz> Famic: you mean structure is always that? yes they are all hidden when a box is collapsed
[05:47:30] <jarr0dsz> i mean expanded... expanded
[05:47:35] <rue> jarr0dsz: But how are the two related? Is it   <container><closed><expanded></container>
[05:47:35] <chrisinajar> Xotix: if you have an issue, you should just ask your question with any relevent code or error messages
[05:47:46] <Cork> Andres_: whats the reason you stoped using it?
[05:48:02] <Andres_> it attaches all the elements to the last div
[05:48:08] <Famic> jarr0dsz: first of all, a change of html could help. If that's not possible, you can check on siblings selectors
[05:48:11] <jarr0dsz> rue: they are part of #imall
[05:48:12] <jarr0dsz> http://jsfiddle.net/V3KVg/2/
[05:48:28] <z3L> Hello. I am trying to make a setLanguage request by ajax, here's the code: http://pastebin.com/PxR6cc6W, however Nothing happens. I have included jquery-1.7.1.min.js
[05:48:35] <jarr0dsz> thats around it maybe i could use that to find the first .hide class and remove it only there?
[05:48:40] <rue> jarr0dsz: There *must* be a way to identify the correct .closed_content. Is it an Nth sibling? Parent? Child? Closest?
[05:49:03] <Xotix> chrisinajar: it's not a jquery related question actually but i know i should just ask.
[05:49:04] <Cork> Andres_: uh... i only see two img tags, and none of them is in any of the divs
[05:49:16] <Famic> jarr0dsz: try .prev(), or make a wrapper and use .parents('.wrapper').find('.collapsed_content')
[05:49:17] <Andres_> Cork:_refresh
[05:49:30] <Andres_> everything is in div.two
[05:49:36] <aQute> i have a javascript function in that i am getting some data throught ajax how to return that data through parent function ?
[05:49:40] <chrisinajar> Xotix: if you have an issue, you should just ask your question with any relevent code or error messages
[05:50:28] <Cork> Andres_: you should grab myElement inside the loop
[05:50:40] <Andres_> let me check
[05:51:00] <Cork> Andres_: as it is now your doing it beore the loop
[05:51:20] <z3L> Anyone knows what may be causing the problem ? It seems for me it does not initiate the jquery ajax function
[05:51:59] <Andres_> Cork-> Done.ò
[05:52:11] <Andres_> Cork-> Still no go
[05:52:32] <JKarsrud> z3L: ehm, you shouldn't wrap document ready inside a function like that.. And it doesn't look like you're actually using the function
[05:53:25] <z3L> I am, there: <a href="javascript:setLanguage('en');">
[05:53:52] <Cork> Andres_: var myElement = $(this);
[05:54:02] <Cork> you creating a global variable
[05:54:06] <z3L> JKarsrud: I have removed the document.ready. It doesn't change anything.
[05:54:06] <Cork> *your
[05:54:35] <Andres_> omg I LOVE YOU
[05:55:08] <Famic> z3L: you're declaring a funciton, not using it
[05:55:10] <JKarsrud> z3L: well, where do you include your script? can you make a more complete example? Are you sure the function exists when you try to call it? Do you get any errors in your console?
[05:55:37] <Forbidd3n> I can set a class with beforeShowDay, but how do I set a class to past dates with minDate?
[05:55:40] <Forbidd3n> datepicker
[05:56:03] <JKarsrud> z3L: and btw, why not use an id on the <a> and do a $('#someId').click(function(e) { $.ajax(); e.preventDefault() }); instead?
[05:56:06] <Andres_> Cork-> Last issue is chainability
[05:56:23] <z3L> JKarsrud: For now I have created a test webpage, so everything is in on one page. In head I have declared this function and later in body I use it by clicking on a link: <a href="javascript:setLanguage('en');">English</a> . The function is being called for sure, because when I put only alert there, it is alerting me.
[05:56:31] <Andres_> Cork -> If I append a <mytag> it prepends it?
[05:56:48] <Andres_> Cork-> just added it, refresh
[05:56:53] <Forbidd3n> how can I check for past date with beforeShowDay?
[05:56:59] <z3L> jaskal_
[05:57:14] <z3L> JKarsrud: What console ? I know it must be something with jquery
[05:57:18] <Cork> Andres_: i don't really follow
[05:57:29] <Cork> Andres_: you mean you want the added image to....?
[05:57:43] <JKarsrud> z3L: firebug, web inspector or some other JS console in your browser
[05:57:50] <JKarsrud> Do you see the request being made at all?
[05:58:29] <Andres_> Cork->I call the plugin $('one').iCompose({}).append('<mytag>');
[05:58:43] <Cork> ah...
[05:58:59] <Andres_> Cork -> But in the DOM it is placed BEFORE the image
[05:59:11] <Wiz_KeeD> dw, thank you very much for your help
[05:59:16] <Wiz_KeeD> it was just what i wanted
[05:59:34] <Cork> Andres_: onload makes your code async
[06:00:04] <Cork> Andres_: that means your ICompose completes before its done doing its work
[06:00:11] <z3L> JKarsrud: Wait I am using opera, got to check for any console there.
[06:00:19] <JKarsrud> z3L: dragonfly
[06:00:22] <trufoi> can someone tell me why jsonp is not working with https ?
[06:00:31] <Cork> Andres_: you could solve it through a callback
[06:00:32] <JKarsrud> probably pulled up by F12 or something
[06:00:37] <Forbidd3n> anyone on the datepicker question, please?
[06:00:49] <Andres_> Cork -> not sure about what you're saying... onload should fire my plugin once the document is loaded in the DOM?
[06:01:17] <Cork> Andres_: or through a probis see ?.deferred
[06:01:18] <bot-t> Andres_, Deferred Object - jQuery.Deferred, introduced in version 1.5, is a chainable utility object that can register multiple callbacks into callback queues, invoke callback queues, and relay the success or failure state o... http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[06:01:45] <Cork> Andres_: no the onload for the image is triggered when the image is loaded from the server
[06:01:47] <Famic> trufoi: may be a crossdomain issue
[06:01:59] <Cork> Andres_: that means network callback
[06:02:05] <Andres_> Cork-> oh I see what you mean...
[06:02:09] <Cork> Andres_: so you don't know when it will complete
[06:02:28] <trufoi> Famic: but isnt it jsonp to solve crossdomain issues
[06:02:31] <Cork> probis==promis
[06:02:42] <z3L> JKarsrud: I have to get familiar with it.
[06:03:29] <Andres_> Cork -> what about the second version? that one waits until it's loaded. You can find it attached to this page http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/pr.html
[06:03:37] <soc42> while having the "inspect element" view open, the additional class .print is correctly beeing set, but now only both help-one and help-two divs are beeing print. is just want one or two to be printed... please have a look at http://jsfiddle.net/fzX6B/8/
[06:03:43] <Famic> trufoi: show your code
[06:03:59] <Andres_> Cork - > I could merge the two versions
[06:04:05] <Cork> Andres_: same thing
[06:04:27] <Cork> Andres_: only way around it would be to preload all the images, and don't call IComplete until they'r all loaded
[06:04:44] <Cork> Andres_: but that only works if you can load them all (as in not in a mobile)
[06:05:16] <Andres_> for (i=0; i < total; i++) {
[06:05:18] <Andres_> 			pic[i] = new Image();
[06:05:20] <Andres_> 			pic[i].onload = function() {
[06:05:22] <Andres_> 				loaded++; // should never hit a race condition due to JS's non-threaded nature
[06:05:24] <Andres_> 				if (loaded == total) {
[06:05:25] <Andres_> 					//console.log('setting up');
[06:05:27] <Cork> ...
[06:05:27] <Andres_> 					setupScene($this);
[06:05:29] <Andres_> 				}
[06:05:31] <Andres_> 			}
[06:05:33] <Andres_> 			pic[i].src = imageList[i];
[06:05:34] * Cork gtg
[06:05:35] <Andres_> 		}
[06:05:45] <Andres_> Cork -> ok thanks
[06:05:59] <Andres_> sorry for posting code...
[06:06:04] <snover> ?p @ Andres_

[06:08:01] <derhasi> Hi, I'm currenlty standing in front of a big wall: I wanted to get the concrete width of an element (with $(...).widht() ), but on some elements it simply returns 0 (for elements which are set to width: auto).
[06:08:13] <derhasi> Do I have a chance to get the rendered width anyway?
[06:08:39] <Andres_> http://jsfiddle.net/LBjjK/ -> shouldn't that wait until images are loaded before calling the procedure?
[06:09:22] <Famic> derhasi: sounds weird. got a testcase ?
[06:09:55] <todd_work> i'm not having success combining 'ends with' and ':empty': $("span[id$='title_span']")
[06:10:01] <todd_work> am i doing that right?
[06:10:21] <Famic> trufoi:http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[06:10:24] <todd_work> $("span[id$='title_span']:empty")
[06:12:17] <trufoi> so only http support?
[06:13:23] <Famic> trufoi: seems to me you didn't read any doc at all. you don't have the basic setup to even hope that to work imho
[06:14:02] <trufoi> Famic: that is not true as it works fine with the twitter api which is http
[06:14:32] <JAAulde> G'morning jQuerians
[06:17:53] <zatan> Hi I am using keydown on jquery, but backspace is deleting the last simbole just with two presses with backspaces why is that ? http://jsfiddle.net/csTtx/1/
[06:21:20] <brianfreud> In a multi-line select (<select size=10/>), anyone have any ideas on how I can scroll to :selected?
[06:23:14] <erichynds> brianfreud: try setting the scrollTop value of the select box
[06:23:36] <brianfreud> thanks, will try it :)
[06:25:47] <z3L> I remember I had to enable something to use shorter jquery names
[06:27:48] <Andres_> Just tried to create a deferred version of the imageloader, could someone check it please? http://paste.pocoo.org/show/536200/
[06:32:51] <soc42> ok, if anyone's interested... now it works printing each of the two div's individually, based on dynamic css print properties, see http://jsfiddle.net/fzX6B/10/
[06:34:50] <z3L> Are you sure ajax works on latest opera browser?
[06:35:16] <z3L> I am still struggling with my problem. I have made myself sure that jquery is properly loaded and its function works , for example hide()
[06:35:37] <z3L> However when I am trying to do a simple ajax request, even from a jquery documentation. Nothing happens.
[06:38:09] <_johnny> hmm, can someone help me understand why i'm not allowed to do cross "domain" (port) even with allow origin *, yet i'm allowed to do an $.ajax() to the same host, if the .js is run locally (file://...). wouldn't it be the same security issue? if i'm not allowed to do one, shouldn't the other be disallowed aswel? o_O
[06:38:26] <Wiz_KeeD> if i have a parent div, which on mousover castas slideDown on a child div and slideup on the same div when mouseout occurs, how can i avoid the flickering caused by placing the cursor over the child div while it's going up in mid animation??
[06:41:16] <Wiz_KeeD> anyone?
[06:43:51] <caesargus> _johnny: that appears to be a browser security issue that your'e running into, local file systems have the most relaxed security versus websites ...
[06:45:06] <Wiz_KeeD> if i have a parent div, which on mousover castas slideDown on a child div and slideup on the same div when mouseout occurs, how can i avoid the flickering caused by placing the cursor over the child div while it's going up in mid animation??
[06:45:13] <danzik17> _johnny: is it JUST the port that's changing? not the hostname?
[06:46:20] <EdwardIII> hey, how can i track back event listeners to the proper code that's calling them?
[06:46:39] <EdwardIII> for example, i can right click a button and inspect element, view listeners, but that refers me back to the listener in the jquery core code so it's pretty useless
[06:46:46] <EdwardIII> i need something from higher up the stack to make head or tail of it
[06:46:55] <derhasi> Famic, unfortunately, I've got no public test case ... :(
[06:46:58] <sailboat> can you paste what you have?
[06:47:15] <caesargus> you can always throw some "tracer bullets/alerts" in the code that might help EdwardIII
[06:47:50] <Eviltwin> ?alert @ caesargus
[06:47:51] <bot-t> caesargus, Forget alert—use console.log() in Firebug (or your browser’s built in Developer Tools) and welcome to convenience! http://getfirebug.com
[06:48:04] <caesargus> :)
[06:48:09] <EdwardIII> caesargus: sometimes i inherit code with thousands of lines of code and i just want to drop in a simple line where the form gets submitted
[06:48:18] <EdwardIII> but the form is getting submitted by ajax
[06:48:25] <EdwardIII> == testicular agony
[06:48:54] <caesargus> do you know the id of the form or the name of the button that is used to submit the form?
[06:49:33] <EdwardIII> caesargus: most of the time, yeah
[06:49:43] <Wiz_KeeD> if i have a parent div, which on mousover castas slideDown on a child div and slideup on the same div when mouseout occurs, how can i avoid the flickering caused by placing the cursor over the child div while it's going up in mid animation??
[06:50:08] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ Wiz_KeeD
[06:50:09] <bot-t> Wiz_KeeD, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue. While a static paste can sometimes be useful, it does not allow us to experience the issue and tangibly debug it.
[06:50:18] <EdwardIII> Wiz_KeeD: step back an element for your hover event?
[06:50:21] <Wiz_KeeD> it cannot be understood from the description?
[06:50:25] <sailboat> EdwardIII:
[06:50:31] <Wiz_KeeD> EdwardIII, what do you mean by that?
[06:50:45] <EdwardIII> Wiz_KeeD: if you had a code snippet or pastebin i could illustrate
[06:50:56] <_johnny> danzik17: well, yes and no. host is the same, but port and protocol (although protocol doesn't have to) do change
[06:51:09] <Wiz_KeeD> i've herad that there are several events that trigger when you hover your cursor over the element but some also treat the child and some just the element
[06:51:13] <Wiz_KeeD> ok EdwardIII
[06:53:32] <Wiz_KeeD> http://pastie.org/3201638
[06:53:33] <Wiz_KeeD> here you go
[06:54:23] <caesargus> EdwardIII: usually the id of the button is bound to the jquery ajax submit. Ajax events can be triggered by .post, .get, or .ajax
[06:54:25] <Eviltwin> Rather than show PHP source, grab the source of the page when it loads in the browser
[06:54:31] <caesargus> EdwardIII: although I'm sure you already know that :)
[06:55:11] <edrozim> Hello . I am using jquery.dataTables.js  and I need save table state . I am aware about  "bStateSave": true but due to adding custom elements to table toolbar I am fail to use it ...
[06:55:48] <EdwardIII> caesargus: yeah... that's my normal method but it isn't always effective, e.g. sometimes i'm on these monster wordpress projects and that jquery could could be coming form anywhere, even automatically generated by pulling something out of a database
[06:56:03] <EdwardIII> so was just wondering if there was something like event listener + backtrace
[06:56:16] <EdwardIII> or 'show listeners + backtrace"
[06:56:19] <Eviltwin> ?stop @ caesargus
[06:56:19] <bot-t> caesargus, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[06:56:24] <Wiz_KeeD> so any ideeas EdwardIII ?
[06:56:27] <Eviltwin> Look at what those options do
[06:56:32] <Eviltwin> My guess is you don't want the second true
[06:57:04] <EdwardIII> Wiz_KeeD: hrm hard to visualise - want to try putting it in jsfiddle?
[06:57:08] <Eviltwin> EdwardIII: Are you breaking on events?
[06:57:18] <Wiz_KeeD> is it complicated?
[06:57:24] <Eviltwin> ?stop @ Wiz_KeeD
[06:57:25] <bot-t> Wiz_KeeD, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[06:57:37] <Wiz_KeeD> i allready use that
[06:57:39] <Eviltwin> Look at what those options do
[06:57:40] <Wiz_KeeD> no?
[06:57:42] <Eviltwin> My guess is you don't want the second true
[06:57:51] <Wiz_KeeD> what does jumptoend mean ?
[06:57:54] <Wiz_KeeD> Eviltwin?
[06:57:56] <caesargus> EdwardIII: I'd actually be intersted in that answer myself :)
[06:58:06] <Eviltwin> RTFM
[06:58:20] <EdwardIII> Eviltwin: mmm no, just looking at 'Event Listeners' under chrome and see what's there
[06:58:39] <Wiz_KeeD> Eviltwin, it does the exact same thing
[06:58:53] <Eviltwin> Wiz_KeeD: As?
[06:59:07] <Eviltwin> EdwardIII: jQuery only binds on event listener of a given type to a given element
[07:00:02] <Wiz_KeeD> i hover over the parent element, the child one starts sliding down i move away the cursor and place it again on the child and it sarts flickering violently
[07:00:35] <Wiz_KeeD> that might also be because of the fact it has absolute positioning and it slides over the next element which is a div of the same type
[07:00:37] <EdwardIII> Eviltwin: do you see what i mean though?
[07:00:38] <Wiz_KeeD> with the same functionality
[07:00:52] <EdwardIII> maybe 'backtrace' is the wrong term, but i mean something like a backtrace
[07:01:46] <Eviltwin> EdwardIII: http://code.google.com/chrome/devtools/docs/scripts-breakpoints.html
[07:02:09] * EdwardIII reads
[07:02:12] <EdwardIII> thanks, Eviltwin
[07:02:49] <EdwardIII> break on dom mutations
[07:02:52] <EdwardIII> that is extremely useful
[07:02:58] <Eviltwin> Yes
[07:04:17] <danzik17> _johnny: try setting document.domain explicitly.  not sure if that disregards protocol or not.
[07:04:38] <Eviltwin> Don't think you can disregard protocol
[07:04:41] <EdwardIII> Eviltwin: and break on event listeners, that looks perfect
[07:04:50] <Eviltwin> EdwardIII: Like I said
[07:05:24] <caesargus> Eviltwin: that's awesome!
[07:05:52] <EdwardIII> Eviltwin: i didn't quite get what you meant - thanks for the pointer
[07:08:01] <Wiz_KeeD> how can i make such an example for you guys to help me EdwardIII ?

[07:10:00] <z3L> Does anyone know, why this code: http://pastebin.com/WY2zkgEf doesn't alert me. I know the function is called for sure, when I've changed the body of the function to hide the div elements in the page, it hides them. Thus I know, the jquery library works for sure.
[07:10:23] <Eviltwin> z3L: Did you try specifying the request type
[07:10:44] <z3L> Eviltwin: No, you mean the get or post request?
[07:10:44] <EdwardIII> Wiz_KeeD: splitting your example up into a jsfiddle might get more people involved
[07:10:52] <EdwardIII> Wiz_KeeD: i'm a bit useless :) but others are smarter
[07:11:10] <Wiz_KeeD> my example will be useless since it uses localhost resources
[07:11:18] <z3L> Eviltwin: Frankly I dont need them. What I am planning to do is requesting a page, which changes the language in session, then refresh the page.

[07:12:43] <Wiz_KeeD> i cannot in this case
[07:12:44] <EdwardIII> well it does me, anyway (sometimes)
[07:12:47] <Wiz_KeeD> don't know what's wrong

[07:19:46] <Chopps> hi guys, i have an input type="select" with several options, is it possible to get the label value from that options with jquery? thanks in advance
[07:20:23] <caesargus> do you just want the labels of the select box?
[07:20:30] <caesargus> or do you want the selected value label?
[07:20:35] <_johnny> danzik17: thanks for the tip, unfortunately it is not allowed by at least one browser i need to support. looking into forcing more laxed CORS on the server. will let you know if it works
[07:21:15] <soc42> hey #jquery
[07:21:27] <soc42> how can i troubleshoot jquery most easy within firebug?
[07:21:40] <caesargus> the way I got around cross domain issues was to place a server side script on the domain that I could access and use the server side script to return the data from the other domain ... (it's a hack but it works)
[07:22:03] <caesargus> can  you narrow that question down soc42 ?
[07:22:03] <Chopps> the selected value label caesargus, eg. <option value="red">Red Color</option> i want to get Red Color
[07:22:15] <soc42> as my example on jsfiddle.net works, i need to troubleshoot interferences on my development site, according to the given code example should works
[07:22:36] <caesargus> Chopps: http://marcgrabanski.com/articles/jquery-select-list-values
[07:23:19] <soc42> caesargus: i try to lookup in firebug, e.g. inside the DOM where the customly added jquery functions might occur
[07:23:28] <Chopps> thank you caesargus
[07:23:33] <soc42> my example is this: http://jsfiddle.net/fzX6B/10/
[07:24:24] <soc42> i am looking for a way to troubleshoot the path jquery takes while manipulating the dev sites html code in firebug
[07:25:10] <soc42> e.g. some code pieces occur like  "jQuery16408295394557854113=Object { olddisplay="block"}  marked in red in the sourcecode view

[07:25:45] <caesargus> neat link Eviltwin :)
[07:27:14] <Eviltwin> soc42: That's likely because of the way jQuery stores data associated with objects and elements
[07:27:24] <soc42> thanks for the link, Eviltwin.
[07:27:32] <aro> im getting this error when clicking on my tabs in chrome: event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit. They will be removed from the engine in the near future.
[07:27:39] <scratcha> is it ok to include native javascript functions in a jquery plugin ? e.g. function changeSlide(targetSlide) {}  ?
[07:27:49] <soc42> my problem at the moment is, that there are no errors in the console, but the page does not behave as expected?!
[07:29:25] <Andres_> @scratcha AFAIK it's fine
[07:30:12] <aro> anyone seen that?
[07:34:00] <Andres_> I have found and implemented a function that should fire when images are loaded using DEFER. I am unable to call it successfully though, need a hand with that; here is the page that uses it: http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/jqt.html
[07:38:38] <Eviltwin> soc42: Did you read those slides?
[07:39:29] <Eviltwin> soc42: It tells you how to debug even when there aren't errors
[07:39:33] <soc42> i am in the middle of reading them... but i don't really get the point on breakpoints yet
[07:39:49] <aro> I get this error in chrome when using jquery ui tabs: event.layerX and event.layerY are broken and deprecated in WebKit
[07:39:51] <Eviltwin> Have you done other kinds of programming before?
[07:42:36] <soc42> sure
[07:42:54] <soc42> been developing since 1986 ;o)
[07:43:07] <seutje> any1 know a reason FF would ignore me setting the hash?

[07:43:50] <seutje> I can see it pop up in the address bar, and when inspecing window.location.hash, it's there, it just doesn't jump to the anchor :(
[07:43:55] <soc42> seem things are getting better now ;o)
[07:44:07] <Andres_> argh, still having problems with each(function()) while writing a plugin.... seems if I call the plugin with $('div') it only appends to the second div....
[07:47:58] <Andres_> could someone kindly help me?
[07:49:16] <Hooloovoork> Andres_: justask

[07:58:39] <Andres_> Famic, any ideas?
[07:58:42] <cybersholt> Andres_ what part are u having trouble with ?
[07:59:30] <Andres_> the plugin does not append the resulting image properly
[08:00:22] <Famic> Andres_: that is an unknow plugin in version 0.1. Please don't ping me for that
[08:00:39] <cybersholt> ill see if i can help ya Andres_
[08:01:10] <Andres_> thanks cybersholt... I'm sorry Famic, won't bother you anymore... NEVER
[08:02:03] <cybersholt> no problem bro im might not be the best @ this stuff but i try
[08:02:12] <cybersholt> it looks like the prob is right @ the end
[08:03:27] <Andres_> if I target a single div it works
[08:04:34] <cybersholt> all right im gonna set this up in a jsfiddle
[08:05:45] <Andres_> thanks
[08:07:01] <cybersholt> np :)
[08:07:50] <Andres_> I have another issue with the same plugin, if we manage to get over this hurdle
[08:10:05] <cybersholt> all right it seems to be having issues on jsfiddle with cross domain errors
[08:10:12] <cybersholt> http://jsfiddle.net/cybersholt/djsVy/
[08:10:51] <Andres_> having a little trouble connecting to jsfiddle over here
[08:11:10] <cybersholt> me 2 its laggy today it seems
[08:13:00] <Andres_> not working over here
[08:14:02] <Andres_> * if * you want you can just dl the plugin code and try it locally
[08:14:16] <Andres_> it just needs a couple of images
[08:15:05] <kul> how to stopn an auto playing function using another function ?
[08:15:56] <cybersholt> all right i think im gonna have to
[08:16:03] <Flavius1924> can you tell me how can i put this http://screencast.com/t/L0x22DdO to the left when it goes to the right side of the screen ? http://screencast.com/t/1lJrp4KIW6Vm this is how it looks now
[08:17:11] <Andres_> that's qtip
[08:17:17] <Andres_> there is an option
[08:17:22] <Andres_> you just set it
[08:17:34] <Andres_> and if it falls out of the screen it changes sides
[08:17:41] <Flavius1924> yes,but what is the option ?
[08:17:55] <Flavius1924> i guess it is something to be set on true,but i don't know what
[08:18:08] <Andres_> position: {adjust: {screen: true}}}
[08:18:31] <Andres_> not sure if it works in qtip2
[08:19:03] <Andres_> @cybersholt... any news?
[08:19:05] <Flavius1924> where should i put this ?
[08:21:11] <Andres_> http://pastebin.com/WGeDbSDk
[08:21:45] <shesek> How can I remove the X-Requested-With header from AJAX requests?
[08:21:49] <cybersholt> it definitely @ the end that last each i keep having security probs for some reason
[08:22:01] <cybersholt> firing up my server
[08:22:04] <Andres_> as I suspected it won't work in 2.0, you have to use viewport (see pastebin)
[08:22:09] <shesek> Found some answers on Google, but all of them leaves the header without any content
[08:22:09] <shesek> I want to completely remove it; possible?
[08:22:40] <AdvoWork> dont suppose anyone knows how I can pull the data(all column data for each row) thats in a datatables table?
[08:23:09] <Andres_> from jQuery? I doubt so... but then again... I'm rather n00b
[08:23:26] <Flavius1924> $('.selector').qtip({
[08:23:26] <Flavius1924>    content: {
[08:23:26] <Flavius1924>       text: 'If I go off-screen, my positioning corners will adjust. Resize your browser window to see!'
[08:23:26] <Flavius1924>    },
[08:23:26] <Flavius1924>    position: {
[08:23:27] <Flavius1924>       viewport: $(window)
[08:23:27] <Flavius1924>    }
[08:23:28] <Flavius1924> });
[08:23:49] <Andres_> @Advo oh sorry from DATATABLES
[08:23:51] <xec> lol, was that a shamequit?
[08:24:08] <Flavius1924> sorry about that
[08:24:11] <Andres_> @Advo suppose you can do that
[08:24:58] <cybersholt> Andres_ its working right on my end now using id's
[08:25:43] <Andres_> it should work when you call it with ids as selectors, it wont work when you call it using "div"
[08:26:06] <cybersholt> yea cuz u need to target a specific element
[08:26:51] <Andres_> well I would like it to be universal, i.e. I can target group of elements too
[08:28:03] <cybersholt> i see theres a few approaches to that but you will need to loop thru the elements get the all the details then run icompose on it
[08:28:24] <jeffreylevesque> has anyone created a jquery slideshow before?
[08:29:50] <Andres_> @cybersholt that's what it's doing with "return this.each(function() {"
[08:30:47] <Andres_> it should iterate through the elements and append an image to every element but it wont work
[08:31:32] <cybersholt> all right lemme see here
[08:33:53] <Andres_> been on it for nearly three days
[08:34:49] <AdvoWork> im doing $(document).delegate("#raise_po_button", "click", function(event) { event.preventDefault(); alert("Raise PO"); raise_po(); event.preventDefault(); }); which alerts RAISE PO, yet won't run the alert in raise_po(); any suggestions please?
[08:35:00] <jsumners> I have an object that takes in options for $.ajax, applies some default options, and then fires of a request to $.ajax (yes, I know about $.ajaxSetup). When I step through a call to this function I see the correct options object being sent to $.ajax, but the actual request doesn't have all of the options. For example, my request should be a POST with a custom header, and $.ajax has those options on the object passed in, but the request ends up
[08:35:00] <jsumners>  being a GET without the header being sent. Any ideas on why this might be happening?
[08:35:50] <pringlescan> Hey everyone. I stored some content in local storage. I'm pulling it out now and I have to add it to my page. I want to do so in an elegant way. What's the best way of programmatically adding similar content?
[08:36:18] <pringlescan> I don't want it to look like spaghetti code, I was thinking of making an object for each content type and overriding it's toString() property to build the html tag itself
[08:37:25] <NoiseEee> what is the content?
[08:37:32] <NoiseEee> DOM elements?  text content?
[08:38:29] <pringlescan> NoiseEee, it's JSON, text content with some terse shorthand that I've accounted for
[08:38:45] <pringlescan> so I have some stuff I need to do to each content type which is content type specific to get it ready to go on the page
[08:39:06] <pringlescan> I just don't want my code to be a mess…
[08:39:21] <NoiseEee> pringlescan: overriding toString() and making an object for each content type sounds like a potential mess
[08:40:31] <pringlescan> NoiseEee, what would you do? I'm open to suggestions.
[08:41:08] <elux> how can i bind a keypress on an <input> ? i am trying to detect when someone presses enter...
[08:41:23] <NoiseEee> really it depends on the data.  surely jquery methods take a lot of pain out already, worry about the 'mess' on refactoring
[08:41:51] <AdvoWork> im doing $(document).delegate("#raise_po_button", "click", function(event) { event.preventDefault(); alert("Raise PO"); raise_po(); event.preventDefault(); }); which alerts RAISE PO, yet won't run the alert in raise_po(); any suggestions please?
[08:42:57] <hazamonzo> Folks. is there not a style for jquery ui select dropdowns? or do i need a third party plugin?
[08:43:57] <pringlescan> hazamonzo, did you try to roll your own theme on the jQuery UI website?
[08:44:30] <NoiseEee> AdvoWork: what does your console say?  what is raise_po();?  maybe there's an error in that before any alert() it has?
[08:44:50] <hazamonzo> pringlescan: I have yes. Just now in fact. I have nice styles for buttons and such. Looking to attach my jquery ui theme to  select dropdown
[08:45:15] <AdvoWork> NoiseEee, its literally just function raise_po() {alert("In Here");
[08:45:35] <NoiseEee> AdvoWork: and what does your console say?
[08:45:47] <NoiseEee> surely you've just typo'd the closing brace there? ^^
[08:45:59] <AdvoWork> yeah
[08:46:04] <joshsmith> let's say I'm fading in a success dialog at the top of my page; within the fadeIn() callback function I'd like to then fade it out and hide it
[08:46:08] <AdvoWork> console is giving no errors at the moment, which is the weird thing
[08:46:15] <joshsmith> what's the best way to delay the beginning of that fadeOut?
[08:46:16] <pringlescan> I'm looking for some examples over converting objects to dom and keeping the code that creates the html strings or dom objects manageable… has anyone seen an example?
[08:46:29] <hazamonzo> pringlescan: it looks like jquery UI doesn't have a select widget  http://jqueryui.com/demos/
[08:46:37] <joshsmith> should I do .delay()?
[08:46:51] <joshsmith> hm, I should
[08:47:00] <pringlescan> hazamonzo, do you have an example of what you'd think your select to look like? You're going to need to use your own CSS
[08:47:11] <pringlescan> *like
[08:47:19] <NoiseEee> AdvoWork: tell it to break on all errors
[08:47:23] <hazamonzo> pringlescan: I do. Im going to base the CSS on the jquery ui theme i just generated :)
[08:49:02] <pringlescan> hazamonzo, I like to use Chrome or Safari and check out the "computed" styles for an element and base my style sheet off of those
[08:49:41] <Andres_> is anyone up for paid help?
[08:50:01] <AdvoWork> NoiseEee, where do i set that? Can't see that option
[08:50:05] <caesargus> are you paying or are we paying :D
[08:50:23] <Andres_> actually my company is gonna pay, so neither of us
[08:50:33] <Andres_> :)
[08:50:38] <caesargus> fantastic
[08:50:39] <hazamonzo> pringlescan: Okay i can do that. Was hoping that the select widget just existed within JQ ui
[08:52:46] <Andres_> @caesargus are you being sarcastic or do you want to try?
[08:53:15] <caesargus> I'd love to help, but I think other people are more skilled than I
[08:54:13] <Andres_> cybersholt is on it as well, but seems he's having a hard time figuring the problem out too
[08:54:28] <caesargus> what exactly is the problem?
[08:54:48] <Andres_> http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/jqt.html
[08:55:17] <Andres_> the plugin is unable to iterate through the objects and appends all results to only one layer
[08:55:20] <Andres_> (div)
[08:55:29] <bhuber> hey guys, i have a question that is probably dumb, but i figure someone here probably knows the answer
[08:55:40] <gho5t> I'm rendering an svg chart via an ajax call that inserts the chart into the dom. It works fine in IE 8 but not 9. Any idea why this might happen?
[08:55:56] <bhuber> suppose I have the following code:
[08:55:57] <bhuber> $(document).ready(function(){ console.debug("foo"); });
[08:56:02] <bhuber> $(document).ready(function(){ console.debug("bar"); });
[08:56:15] <bhuber> am i guarenteed that i'll see "foo" before "bar" in the console?
[08:56:29] <caesargus> Andres_: it does not appear to be loading anything in the first div
[08:56:54] <Andres_> exactly but it should
[08:57:23] <caesargus> Andres_: line #11 - references 'div' not '.one'
[08:58:27] <caesargus> oh
[08:58:32] <Andres_> yeah
[08:58:39] <Andres_> THAT's the problem
[08:58:49] <caesargus> I think I see what you're trying
[08:58:59] <caesargus> you want to apply the div to all the instances
[08:59:00] <Andres_> are you on tomorrow caesargus?
[08:59:10] <caesargus> probably :)
[08:59:20] <caesargus> although tomorrow is a busy day for me
[08:59:47] <Andres_> what's the time where you are?
[09:00:57] <Andres_> i've gotta go soon, so I was seeing if we can hook up tomorrow
[09:01:06] <caesargus> it's 12p now
[09:01:15] <caesargus> it looks like your guy is making progress though :)
[09:01:28] <caesargus> I just refreshed the page and things look a bit different than they did
[09:02:16] <Andres_> it still doesn't work properly...
[09:02:31] <Andres_> the image should be attached to both divs
[09:02:55] * caesargus nods - progress is being made :D
[09:03:28] <caesargus> if we can hook up tomorrow, I'll see how I can assist Andres_
[09:03:54] <Andres_> cool man, I'll log on tomorrow morning (it's 6.00 pm here)
[09:04:22] <Andres_> cheers to all the folks over here @ jquery
[09:04:39] <caesargus> cheers Andres_
[09:06:43] * chee rs!
[09:08:22] <bhuber> i've got to run, be back in an hour, i'd appreciate it if someone answers my question above while I'm gone though :)
[09:09:49] <nicovalencia> bhuber: they get executed in the order they are parsed, so yes.
[09:10:07] <nicovalencia> I believe they are merged into one handler that gets fired on doc ready.
[09:10:51] <nicovalencia> If you want to promote better readibility ( especially if the order matters ), you should probably make a function containing the order-dependant code and call that on doc ready instead.
[09:11:18] <mdpatrick> Is there a way to use the jquery ajax method to submit a form on the page? via ajax? I like using the complete method as a way of popping up a modal in lieu of refreshing the whole page
[09:11:49] <hazamonzo> getting a select tag within a div called foo... $('#foo  select')   ?
[09:12:08] <gho5t> I'm rendering an svg chart via an ajax call that inserts the chart into the dom. It works fine in IE 8 but not 9. Any idea why this might happen?
[09:12:35] <cornfeed> is there a popular code checking utility other than jslint?
[09:24:20] <soc42> occuring a strange error description on safari mac while using jquery in a plain top-down javascript block, not within a regular javascript function, resulting in the following error message:  XML self-closing tag syntax used on <div>. The tag will not be closed.
[09:30:50] <z0ned> what's the proper way to swap two images, while having a fade effect? bind a 'load' function and call fadeIn() ?
[09:30:57] <z0ned> and hide() the old one?
[09:32:21] <KoVaLskY> http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/#range   how I can get input value  like this value="100 - 400" ?
[09:36:37] <Eviltwin> z0ned: Fade the new one in over then once it's done, hide the old one
[09:37:09] <soc42> ok, Eviltwin seems to have a better understanding now, thank you very much!
[09:37:35] <soc42> i see now a problem in the page... which i am trying to fix
[09:37:55] <z0ned> Eviltwin, var img = new Image(); img.src = "blah.jpg"; img.bind('load', function() { $(this).fadeIn(); $("#otherImg").hide();});
[09:37:58] <z0ned> is that what i'd want?
[09:38:41] <Eviltwin> $(this).fadeIn("slow", function() { $("#otherImg").hide(); });
[09:38:48] <soc42> i can successfully toggle a div with some content (text, links, etc...) but while toggling e.g. the <a>-tags won't get a display block?
[09:39:12] <z0ned> Eviltwin, so i don't need to do anything to make sure the img has loaded first?
[09:39:38] <Eviltwin> No, I mean in place of your $(this).fadeIn(); $("#otherImg").hide(); section
[09:39:58] <Eviltwin> You want to wait for the callback on the fadeIn
[09:40:10] <Eviltwin> Before hiding the old one
[09:57:45] <gho5t> I'm having a problem getting IE to render some content I am sucking in via an ajax call. I think it is because it is an SVG element with some scripts. What is the right way to add these elements to a div? Currently I'm using $('#mydiv').html(data) in the ajax success callback
[09:58:40] <soc42> seem, that jquery can't bind an event to a <a href... that has previously been hidden (display:none) within a parent <div> ?!
[09:58:53] <soc42> -seem +seems
[09:59:27] <NoiseEee> soc42: doubt it
[09:59:32] <soc42> why is bind bound to a visual css behaviour?
[09:59:42] <NoiseEee> i bet its not unless you can replicate that on jsfiddle
[10:00:04] <Eviltwin> soc42: We're saying that what you're describing isn't a thing
[10:00:33] <Eviltwin> Not that it's expected behavior
[10:00:48] <Eviltwin> Can you make a (small) demonstration of the issue on jsFiddle.net
[10:02:39] <Eviltwin> soc42: ?
[10:02:50] <soc42> yup.
[10:02:51] <Eviltwin> soc42: Can you make a demonstration of the issue at jsFiddle.net?
[10:03:00] <soc42> just a mom please
[10:03:03] <gho5t> how bout a real challenge mates

[10:04:01] <someprimetime> yo Eviltwin, so i'm working on that carousel still and i've got it to actually finitely scroll to the right (i'm keeping track of it with a "click counter")
[10:04:03] <Eviltwin> WTF?
[10:04:07] <someprimetime> the problem is going back to the previously first element
[10:04:17] <someprimetime> should i reset the counter once they reach the end?
[10:04:19] <gho5t> i don't want to mess with raphael
[10:04:24] <andrew9183> ooooh, can i see someprimetime

[10:04:31] <someprimetime> andrew9183: sure one sec
[10:04:37] <Eviltwin> Make a demo of your problem at jsFiddle.net
[10:06:45] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/VEkjH/
[10:09:23] <soc42> well, you're right... it works on jsfiddle.net, but i can't seem to figure it out on my dev site! see http://jsfiddle.net/9K8Nj/
[10:09:50] <Eviltwin> Are you binding after document ready?
[10:10:17] <soc42> nope.
[10:11:01] <soc42> is it preferred?
[10:11:08] <soc42> +to be
[10:11:20] <Eviltwin> Something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/9K8Nj/1/
[10:12:48] <Kara_sweet>   $('#clickme3').click(function() {
[10:12:48] <Kara_sweet>      $('#neat').addClass('.ohmy').show('slow').removeClass('.ohmy');
[10:12:48] <Kara_sweet>    });
[10:13:04] <Kara_sweet> hey guys how do you chain this method?
[10:13:18] <Eviltwin> You mean remove the ohmy after?
[10:13:23] <Kara_sweet> yea
[10:13:27] <Eviltwin> Use the callback
[10:13:38] <Eviltwin> .show('slow', function() { $(this).removeClass(".ohmy"); })
[10:14:00] <Kara_sweet> how do you put that into the statement
[10:16:47] <Whirl3d> has anybody seen a jquery based custom select element that lets the user enter a custom value?
[10:17:13] <soc42> so, after all it seemed that just the document.ready-function was missing...
[10:17:20] <Kara_sweet> hey eviltwin i used that line and i couldnt get it to work
[10:17:22] <soc42> now everything works as expected, oh my...
[10:17:39] <Whirl3d> I want to make the popup list appear when clicked, but disappear if "other" is selected--replacing it with an text input field....of course, until clicked again...
[10:19:11] <someprimetime> andrew9183: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/VEkjH/ not sure if you got that. it's a little long at the moment so forgive me if you're already scoping it out.
[10:20:51] <coderDJ412> Hello all
[10:21:14] <coderDJ412> Does anyone have any links to sites with jquery exercises?
[10:21:23] <Kara_sweet> eviltwin, i added the callback and i couldnt get it to work :(

[10:22:43] <Kara_sweet> https://gist.github.com/2f632d45a548d60b55ce
[10:23:07] <someprimetime> Kara_sweet: why don't you just use a toggleClass?
[10:23:19] <someprimetime> or maybe i'm not sure what your'e doing
[10:23:22] <Kara_sweet> because i want to understand how it would work if i didnt
[10:23:22] <someprimetime> you're, too
[10:26:02] <bhuber> nicovalencia: thanks for the help.  Handler wrapper function is a good idea, might not be able to do it since they occur in different parts of the code.
[10:27:43] <nicovalencia> Glad that helped :)
[10:33:51] <someprimetime> how should i be keeping track of scrolling back to previous in this:  http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/VEkjH/

[10:39:50] <joshsmith> what am I thinking of? there's some new shortened syntax that's like $('selector:something')
[10:39:57] <Eviltwin> New?
[10:40:02] <joshsmith> I thought?
[10:40:04] <joshsmith> as of 1.7
[10:40:04] <Eviltwin> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[10:40:05] <ravenzz> josh__ no
[10:40:10] <ravenzz> lol
[10:40:39] <Eviltwin> The :thing selectors are called psuedo selectors
[10:41:28] <joshsmith> yeah, I just thought I saw something somewhere
[10:41:32] <joshsmith> I'm probably just retarded
[10:41:36] <joshsmith> no worries
[10:41:52] <someprimetime> joshsmith: same here
[10:42:02] <someprimetime> with being a retard, that is
[10:42:07] <someprimetime> it's all good. we have each other
[10:42:39] <joshsmith> yeah, I love a sense of retarded community
[10:44:07] <gho5t> is this the proper way to call the "show" method on a tooltip when creating it? $that.tooltip({ option1: 'foo', option2: 'foo2' }, 'show'); ?
[10:49:01] <y3di> can you append an array of dom elements to an element with append() directly? (without having to use a for loop)
[10:49:18] <Eviltwin> Yes but you can't append an array of jQuery collections
[10:49:29] <Eviltwin> Like .append([$("<div>"),$("<div>")]) doesn't work
[10:49:36] <y3di> oh
[10:49:55] <y3di> thats my issue then, thanks Eviltwin
[10:49:57] <Eviltwin> But .append([document.getElementById("foo"),document.getElementById("bar")]) would
[10:50:17] <Emn1ty> anyone have any ideas for me?
[10:50:59] <y3di> so $('<span />') returns a jquery object and not a dom element
[10:51:21] <Eviltwin> Yes, it's why you can do $("<span/>").appendTo("#foo")
[10:51:28] <Eviltwin> DOM elements don't have an appendTo function
[10:51:33] <Eviltwin> And even if they did, they wouldn't accept a selector
[10:51:54] <y3di> right, so jquery objects are essentially just a wrapper for dom elements
[10:52:05] <y3di> to give them more functionality
[10:52:24] <Eviltwin> Yes and also can represent multiple or zero elements
[10:55:15] <someprimetime> hey Eviltwin how should i keep track of scrolling back to the previous elements in my finite scroll example? i'm currently thinking just take the current panel, if the number of clicks is 0, that means they are at the beginning of the carousel, so don't animate before that, but otherwise animate the amount of panels (if it's 3 multiply that by the element widths and then subtract one of the margins)… kinda what i'm doing for
[10:55:15] <someprimetime> the next clicks
[10:55:27] <someprimetime> but i'm thinking having these counter vars is a little sloppy
[10:55:30] <someprimetime> :{
[10:56:44] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: I'm thinking it might be better to design this a little differently
[10:57:06] <someprimetime> Eviltwin: yeah, but at this point we need to use it on the site, and it'll definitely be revisited later
[10:57:21] <Eviltwin> Also, there's a question of whether you're switching between infinite scroll and regular scroll
[10:57:25] <someprimetime> the infinite scrolling works nicely (thanks to you)
[10:57:33] <Eviltwin> And what happens if it's currently on the overlap
[10:57:36] <Emn1ty> anyone have any idea why a jquery assigned z-index would prevent me from allowing an element on my page to exist above it?
[10:57:40] <someprimetime> yeah, well if the html attribute of infinite="true" it'll scroll infinitely
[10:57:46] <Emn1ty> http://vehicleinventorynetwork.com/ja/newportCoastAuto/index.php
[10:57:51] <someprimetime> otherwise it'll be finite scroll
[10:58:01] <Eviltwin> But it won't change once it starts?
[10:58:06] <someprimetime> nope
[10:58:16] <someprimetime> it's either one or the other depending on which is specified
[10:58:54] <Eviltwin> Well that should make it easier
[10:59:14] <Eviltwin> And it can work a little differently
[10:59:19] <someprimetime> yeah, i'm pretty close
[10:59:29] <Eviltwin> For example instead of moving the slides
[10:59:44] <Eviltwin> You can just change the left
[10:59:47] <someprimetime> it's just the problem currently is say the user clicks a bunch of times to go to the next slides, then they click to see the previous, i've got to have a counter for both sides i think
[11:00:17] <someprimetime> one keeping track of how many slides are left to see in the right direction, and the other for the left direction
[11:00:37] <someprimetime> which i have for the right direction
[11:00:51] <someprimetime> then if it goes > the amount of slides left, it'll just give a nice bounce effect
[11:00:52] <Eviltwin> That can work or you can just do a little addition and subtraction using the total number of slides and the visible number of slides
[11:01:21] <someprimetime> i'll post an update when i think i've got it.. i'm close ;)
[11:04:04] <Planet_EN> how do I make a cross domain request from a local.html file to the this url: http://www.espncricinfo.com/south-africa-v-sri-lanka-2011/engine/current/match/514037.html
[11:04:21] <NoiseEee> Planet_EN: using your back-end really
[11:04:45] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by local.html?
[11:04:49] <Eviltwin> What's the URL look like?
[11:04:57] <Planet_EN> i posted the url above
[11:05:19] <murosai> how should i replace the contents of one element with another? like $("foo").html($("bar").html())?
[11:05:31] <andrew9183> someprimetime: it looks good
[11:05:33] <Eviltwin> The URL of the file you're requesting from?
[11:05:42] <andrew9183> are you following a tutorial?  i believe there was a nice tutorial for this carousel
[11:05:55] <Planet_EN> everytime I do a request through $.ajax it gives me SyntaxError: unexpected token
[11:05:55] <chrislabeard> how can I show the browser size using jquery
[11:06:02] <Eviltwin> murosai: I would use $("foo").empty().append($("bar").contents())
[11:06:17] <Eviltwin> Which will move the actual elements
[11:06:25] <Eviltwin> Preserving the event listeners and other data etc.
[11:06:36] <murosai> how does contents() differ from html()?
[11:06:51] <Eviltwin> ?.contents @ murosai
[11:06:51] <bot-t> murosai, .contents(): Get the children of each element in the set of matched elements, including text and comment nodes. http://api.jquery.com/contents/
[11:06:56] <andrew9183> i thought you had to do empty(true) to preserve
[11:07:16] <Eviltwin> andrew9183: .empty doesn't take any args...
[11:07:18] <Planet_EN> and the error that its pointing to is first line
[11:07:21] <andrew9183> oh, nevermind
[11:07:23] <Planet_EN> of the requested file
[11:07:29] <NoiseEee> so what do you folks do about the general issue of firefox never properly updating a <select> element visually when setting an <option> to selected with JS?
[11:07:38] <Planet_EN> says unexpected token "<"
[11:07:44] <Eviltwin> NoiseEee: How are you setting it?
[11:07:48] <Planet_EN> so i guess jsonp cannot be used
[11:07:48] <Eviltwin> You should be using .val()
[11:07:52] <murosai> i still don't see the difference
[11:07:53] <Eviltwin> Or props, not attrs
[11:08:07] <Eviltwin> murosai: No, there won't be a strictly visual difference
[11:08:36] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: either way, same result.  its set when I inquire about the value for example, or when I view the source in firebug... but never visually.  'setting firefox selected option javascript' in google brings up a ton of complaints with no real solution afaik
[11:08:48] <Planet_EN> shhh..
[11:08:52] <Eviltwin> Can you make a jsFiddle?
[11:09:00] <Planet_EN> we're haviing a crises here
[11:09:35] <Eviltwin> Having crises or having a crisis?
[11:09:40] <Planet_EN> so we cannot make cross domain request =/
[11:09:45] <murosai> Eviltwin: so what difference there is if not visual?
[11:09:51] <Planet_EN> unless its jsonp
[11:09:51] <stygyan> i'm fighting against a worse enemy than internet explorer
[11:09:53] <Eviltwin> murosai: I already explained, scroll up
[11:10:04] <Eviltwin> Planet_EN: see ?sop
[11:10:05] <bot-t> Planet_EN, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin. Two pages are considered to have the same origin if the protocol, port, and host are the same for both pages. http://rj3.net/mdc/sop
[11:10:29] <MadLems> how would i use the jQuery selector to get the 4th <tr> inside of the first table with the class "form-table"?  $('table.form-table' > tr) should get the first <tr>, but how to get the 4th?
[11:11:05] <Eviltwin> MadLems: http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[11:11:20] <MadLems> Eviltwin: thanks :)
[11:11:33] <Planet_EN> my problem is related to CORS
[11:11:46] <Eviltwin> Planet_EN: Well CORS is pretty limited
[11:12:02] <Eviltwin> In the grand scheme of things
[11:12:05] <NoiseEee> Planet_EN: you can only use CORS if the server you're requesting from is properly set up for it
[11:12:10] <Planet_EN> changing document.domain raises a security error too
[11:12:14] <NoiseEee> Planet_EN: *and* you have a CORS-enabled browser
[11:12:44] <Eviltwin> There are also limits to what you can set document.domain to
[11:12:46] <NoiseEee> Planet_EN: if you get the content with your backend and then pipe it to JS in an XHR call, you will be golden.
[11:13:09] <Planet_EN> really?
[11:13:13] <Planet_EN> nodejs it is then..
[11:13:17] <NoiseEee> uhh
[11:13:31] <Eviltwin> Doesn't have to be node...
[11:13:36] <NoiseEee> as long as you're using node.js as your backend/server right now ?
[11:16:39] <Spipmalion> hello
[11:17:24] <Spipmalion> with Jquery tabs : trying to follow a tab's URL instead of loading its content via ajax (it's on the manual), but cannot find how to do it for only one tab ? (#tab-6)
[11:17:48] <Planet_EN> NoiseEee: im using cherrypy as backend, but well I think i'd just switch to nodejs and ender for this
[11:17:52] <andrew9183> what do you mean follow a tab's URL?
[11:18:21] <Spipmalion> one tab is <a href="http://www.url.com">, not <a href="#tab-6">
[11:21:47] <ravenzz> Spipmalion if (url && /(#tab-6)$/.test(url))
[11:22:08] <ravenzz> or maybe you could use the tab index
[11:23:40] <Spipmalion> oh it seems that the example given in http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#...open_links_in_the_current_tab_instead_of_leaving_the_page only goes into if(url) if the url is not a true url
[11:24:26] <Spipmalion> :-)
[11:24:27] <Spipmalion> thanks
[11:25:44] <jsumners> I'm seeing some odd stuff happening with $.ajax options in http://jsfiddle.net/jsumners/XRLDV/ . Any ideas?
[11:34:40] <hswolff> is there a jquery function that returns only the data-attributes of the object?
[11:35:20] <hswolff> $(el).data() returns the data object, including data-attributes and whatever event data jQuery has attached to that element
[11:35:53] <NoiseEee> hswolff: if you're after them in particular, you'll have to ask for them specifically
[11:35:59] <NoiseEee> .attr('data-whatever')
[11:37:08] <hswolff> i can't predict what the data attributes are going to be as it varies on the dom element.  $(el).data() returns all the data-attributes that i can then access through dot notation however it also returns the jQuery event object
[11:37:11] <hobbelt> http://jsfiddle.net/rqMD9/  <-- trying to toggle a div on mousedown outside the div based on CSS class of the div. This should work right?
[11:38:50] <hswolff> for example: http://cl.ly/0w3b1g0w2U3N2X1P2j1v
[11:40:16] <NoiseEee> hswolff: yes, thatss what data() does
[11:40:28] <luke--> hi there
[11:41:12] <luke--> is there a $.extend()-like function that keeps the original methods properties instead of overwriting them if they are already "there"
[11:41:13] <luke--> ?
[11:41:40] <hswolff> NoiseEee: i'm aware, i'm curious if there's a jQuery function that returns only data-attributes
[11:41:51] <NoiseEee> hswolff: no
[11:41:59] <hswolff> sad :(
[11:42:01] <hswolff> ty tho
[11:51:25] <savolai> p
[11:51:26] <savolai> ppp
[11:51:32] <savolai> oops
[11:52:55] <jvargas> hi. I am using jquery ui dialog with a "Add" button which perfoms an AJAX Post. How can I close the dialog once the POST concludes?
[11:53:24] <jvargas> I would like to close all open dialogs, which selector to use ()?
[11:53:44] <Eviltwin> $(":ui-dialog").dialog("close")
[11:53:55] <Eviltwin> Probably a good idea to filter that down a bit though
[11:54:07] <Eviltwin> Maybe like $("div:ui-dialog").dialog("close") if they're all divs
[11:55:52] <brendan6> Say if I use $.get on a url which results in a response of an entire page (including the <html></html> tags and information in <head />), if I try $(response) I get an array of all the elements inside <head /> and <body /> however it doesn't let me search for ids.  The response looks like http://pastie.org/3203204 but $("#wrap", response) returns an empty array
[11:56:33] <Eviltwin> $(response).find("#wrap")
[11:57:06] <brendan6> Eviltwin: still resulting in an empty array
[11:57:41] <brendan6> Eviltwin: its very odd, can't match any direct children of <body /> or <head /> but can match any of their children
[12:02:37] <CharlieM751> is there some trick to reference the modal that has focus, or search the page for modal divs or something? I'm generating the div names dynamically and trying to get a button to close the modal it is on
[12:02:44] <MagePsycho> guys i have three columns in a td
[12:03:07] <MagePsycho> what i want to do is set certain width of left and right column if center td has noany values
[12:03:11] <MagePsycho> how can i do that?
[12:03:46] <caesargus> noany?
[12:04:21] <caesargus> I don't know why you couldn't have 3 tds in a table I mean I've done it before
[12:04:29] <caesargus> maybe I don't understand the question you're asking MagePsycho
[12:04:30] <NoiseEee> CharlieM751: presumably your modal w/focus has a class indicating so  (if its programmed decently)
[12:04:44] <ringotwo> give each <td> a classname of the column that it's in
[12:05:00] <ringotwo> then use $.each() to iterate over the middle column
[12:05:11] <jvargas> Eviltwin: Thanks!
[12:05:29] <MagePsycho> caesargus: http://www.panzit.com/uctb206
[12:05:36] <MagePsycho> table has three tds
[12:05:51] <ringotwo> if all values are empty string, then break out of the each loop and use $.css() to style the first and last columns
[12:06:19] <MagePsycho> <tr><td>first-col</td><td>2nd col</td><td>3rd col</td></tr>
[12:06:35] <MagePsycho> i want to set width of first and last td
[12:06:39] <MagePsycho> based on middle td
[12:07:00] <MagePsycho> if none of the middle td has value then certain width else certian width
[12:07:12] <MagePsycho> caesargus: did you get my point
[12:08:30] <caesargus> is the uctb206 table that you're referring to MagePsycho ?
[12:08:55] <caesargus> how are you trying to set the width, through HTML or through jquery/dynamically/
[12:09:12] <NoiseEee> MagePsycho: ringotwo already told you how to do it
[12:09:31] <caesargus> yeah that'd work too :D
[12:09:39] <TehRabbitt> quick question, i'm trying to grab the value of a form thats beign populated by RichFaces / it's a regular textfield... but I can't figure out what the ID is...  what ID should I be referencing in my JS? http://pastebin.com/xqEiKnDt
[12:10:22] <MagePsycho> caesargus: jquery/dynamically
[12:11:00] * caesargus points to ringotwo's answer above
[12:11:38] <TehRabbitt> like how would I pull the selected date out of that?
[12:11:54] <MagePsycho> jQuery("#product-additional-data-table > tr > td").eq(0).css("width", "25%").end()
[12:11:54] <MagePsycho> 														.eq(2).css("width", "25%").end();
[12:12:10] <NoiseEee> TehRabbitt: $('#monitorAudit:calInputCurrentDate').val()   ?
[12:12:39] <Sailboat> exit
[12:13:18] <TehRabbitt> NoiseEee: Undefined
[12:14:44] <MagePsycho> jQuery("table#product-additional-data-table > tr > td").eq(0).css("width", "25%");
[12:14:48] <MagePsycho> not working for me
[12:15:02] <caesargus> TehRabbitt: what about this field: id="monitorAudit:calInputDate"
[12:15:21] <caesargus>   id="monitorAudit:calInputCurrentDate" -- sorry I meant this one
[12:15:31] <NoiseEee> i wonder if the : is throwing things off
[12:15:31] <ringotwo> eq(0) doesn't seem right
[12:15:31] <ringotwo> $('#product-additional-data-table > tr > td:first')  is better
[12:15:43] <NoiseEee> TehRabbitt: http://jsfiddle.net/R7CDu/
[12:17:13] <NoiseEee> TehRabbitt: http://jsfiddle.net/R7CDu/1/ even
[12:17:20] <MagePsycho> and for third td?
[12:18:45] <redsquare> TehRabbitt you sorted the jquery issue then!
[12:18:53] <ringotwo> td:last ?
[12:19:03] <MagePsycho> ok will try
[12:19:14] <ringotwo> k
[12:21:14] <ringotwo> good luck, gotta run
[12:21:37] <MagePsycho> not working :)
[12:21:46] <MagePsycho> does the tbody matters?
[12:21:52] <MagePsycho> jQuery("#product-additional-data-table tbody > tr > td:first").css("width", "25%");
[12:21:54] <MagePsycho> not working
[12:22:06] <ringotwoAWAY> i can help you a bit later if you want
[12:22:10] <ringotwoAWAY> ping me in an hour
[12:22:15] <ringotwoAWAY> sorry goo dluck
[12:22:17] <redsquare> jQuery("#product-additional-data-table > tbody
[12:22:25] <redsquare> MagePsycho, ^^
[12:23:09] <redsquare> MagePsycho but why not do that in css?
[12:23:35] <MagePsycho> because td columns width are dynamic
[12:23:45] <MagePsycho> middle columns don't have values
[12:24:27] <redsquare> k
[12:24:29] <NoiseEee> columns without widths are dynamic, not necessarily 'middle columns'
[12:25:08] <MagePsycho> now it works redsquare

[13:04:18] <Zzaichik> console.log(variable);
[13:04:36] <TehRabbitt> I mean detect if it's undefined and assign it to just ""
[13:04:36] * slashdot1 i thought it was like a knock knock joke
[13:04:52] <Zzaichik> hah
[13:05:07] <slashdot1> um, always assign it
[13:05:13] <slashdot1> var asdf;
[13:05:15] <slashdot1> void it out
[13:05:19] <TehRabbitt> Ah
[13:05:36] <TehRabbitt> so I can just var asdf; and it'll just be equal to asdf ="" unless it's defined to something else?
[13:05:43] <slashdot1> yes, (thank douglas crockford)
[13:05:47] <slashdot1> or pray to him like i do
[13:06:05] <TehRabbitt> sweet
[13:06:07] <TehRabbitt> thanks
[13:06:17] <slashdot1> np/sorry to butt in Zzaichik
[13:07:02] <Zzaichik> nope that's cool.
[13:07:33] <dilvie> 'sup jQuery?
[13:11:50] <NoiseEee> TehRabbitt: var asdf;  //asdf!=''
[13:12:38] <NoiseEee> TehRabbitt: var asdf;  alert(typeof(asdf))
[13:13:14] <NoiseEee> you should be checking for undefined variable by using: if (typeof varName=='undefined') { //yes, its really undefined }
[13:13:32] * asdf` is a var, apparently
[13:13:36] <dilvie> or varName === undefined
[13:14:04] <NoiseEee> dilvie: only issue with that is that someone (a horrible, horrible person) could assign something to undefined
[13:15:24] <dilvie> NoiseEee: Anybody can redefine almost everything in JavaScript. If it happens to you, add undefined to your wrapper IIFE as a formal parameter, and then don't pass anything in for it.
[13:16:00] <dilvie> NoiseEee: and you'll have the same issue with typeof...
[13:16:56] <dilvie> NoiseEee: If an asshole wants to wreck your script, they can redefine your array or object prototype, and then virtually everything will go to shit.
[13:17:02] <peetertomberg> .
[13:17:20] <dilvie> the moral is, don't run scripts on your page that you don't trust.
[13:18:26] <dilvie> Pardon my profanity. I don't mean to offend anybody. =)
[13:19:30] <Eviltwin> What do you guys see here? http://jsfiddle.net/J3L7L/
[13:19:39] <TehRabbitt> hm whats wrong with this? (aka where did I fuck up lol): 		if (ScreenSize){ScreenSize=ScreenSize + '"');}
[13:20:21] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: Count your ('s and )'s
[13:20:24] <TehRabbitt> aka test to see if it's undefined, and if it isn't... add a " at the end"
[13:20:26] <NoiseEee> Eviltwin: how to describe!  one row black, three rows read

[13:20:33] <TehRabbitt> X_X lol
[13:20:48] <TehRabbitt> thanks
[13:21:07] <Eviltwin> You should find an editor that catches stuff like that
[13:22:36] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: apparently there's still something wrong though because it's breaking the rest of my code X_X lol
[13:22:46] <TehRabbitt> so simple yet so stupid
[13:22:46] <TehRabbitt> 		if (ScreenSize)
[13:22:47] <TehRabbitt> 			{ScreenSize=ScreenSize + '"';}
[13:22:47] <TehRabbitt> 		else {ScreenSize="";}
[13:23:54] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: am I right in saying that that snippet would test to see if ScreenSize is defined, otherwise it would define it to be ""?
[13:23:57] <peetertomberg> .
[13:24:40] <TehRabbitt> http://pastebin.com/t0JdvwKG
[13:24:43] <TehRabbitt> thats the whole snippet
[13:25:45] <peetertomberg|rd> Heyo
[13:26:10] <ringotwo> you're testing if ScreenSize is defined, which seems wrong
[13:26:20] <TehRabbitt> hey peetertomberg|rd
[13:26:23] <ringotwo> you want to test if ScreenSize length is greater than 0
[13:26:32] <TehRabbitt> ringotwo: ah okay
[13:26:35] <ringotwo> $(ScreenSize).length
[13:28:19] <TehRabbitt> ScreenSize.length is not a function
[13:29:21] <ringotwo> don't put parens after length
[13:29:30] <ringotwo> what's the line look like
[13:29:46] <TehRabbitt> screenSize is not defined			alert(myJQuery(screenSize.length));
[13:30:24] <ringotwo> myJQuery(ScreeSize).length
[13:30:58] <jrcoco> I'm attempting to open a Paypal iframe in a lightbox, does anyone know if this is possible? I've tried using various lightbox libraries and am now playing with jQuery.Forms's ajaxForm().
[13:31:00] <ringotwo> capital S
[13:31:21] <ringotwo> alert(myJQuery(ScreenSize).length);
[13:32:06] <TehRabbitt> 					if (myJQuery(screenSize).length > 0)
[13:32:06] <monk12> hello all, just curious does jquery dialog support position:fixed now? i think i read something about it being integrated in 1.7 or 1.8 once PositionTo is integrated in (2 year old thread).
[13:32:06] <TehRabbitt> 			{ScreenSize=ScreenSize + '"';}
[13:32:06] <TehRabbitt> 		else {ScreenSize="";}
[13:32:06] <TehRabbitt> 		
[13:32:11] <TehRabbitt> so that should work?
[13:32:26] <Eviltwin> WTF?
[13:32:31] <Eviltwin> I don't understand what you're trying to do
[13:32:34] <ringotwo> jrcoco, yes it's possible
[13:32:46] <Eviltwin> And don't paste blocks of code to IRC
[13:32:49] <Eviltwin> Link to pastes
[13:32:54] <ringotwo> yes, that should work
[13:33:07] <TehRabbitt> sorry Evi
[13:33:10] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin:
[13:33:30] <TehRabbitt> ringotwo: well as soon as it hits that code block, it halts the code / prevents it from executing :-\

[13:34:13] <gho5t> shouldn't this call the "show" method when initializing this widget: $(this).tooltip({ option1: 'a', option2: 'b' }, 'show');
[13:34:26] <ringotwo> yeah, sounds like your browser is stopping on errors
[13:34:43] <TehRabbitt> ringotwo: but the console doesn't show any which is weird
[13:35:12] <NoiseEee> TehRabbitt: also, there's a difference between screenSize and ScreenSize.  also, ScreenSize=ScreenSize + '"'; does what exactly?
[13:35:43] <ringotwo> i think it prints inches, for TVs or monitors
[13:35:52] <TehRabbitt> NoiseEee: it's supposed to add " to the end of the #
[13:35:56] <TehRabbitt> exactly what ringotwo just said
[13:36:03] <TehRabbitt> someone enters 15.... it rewrites it 15"
[13:36:17] <TehRabbitt> but if they leave the field blank, it shows up as, nothing
[13:36:58] <ringotwo> capital "S", did you add that?
[13:37:07] <ringotwo> ScreenSize, not screenSize
[13:37:17] <TehRabbitt> yep I added it
[13:37:28] <TehRabbitt> syntax error		else ScreenSize="";
[13:37:32] <jrcoco> ringotwo: I'm attempting to follow the top answer here. Do you have a better recommendation? http://goo.gl/IHVYE
[13:38:14] <ringotwo> TehRabbitt, put it somewhere and i can hav ea look
[13:38:23] <jrcoco> It makes sense to me. Get the results of the forum and populate the fancybox, but it's not even launching the fancybox nor is it throwing errors.
[13:38:57] <ringotwo> becaues you're submitting the form when that button is clicked, right
[13:39:19] <jrcoco> ringotwo, right.
[13:39:37] <ringotwo> well it doesn't have to be a submit button
[13:40:30] <ringotwo> but if you want to keep it, do this: <input id="weiter" name="weiter" type="submit" />
[13:40:41] <TehRabbitt> ringotwo: sorry back: http://pastebin.com/peU4T358
[13:40:55] <brianfreud> I just realized that labels could be used in conjunction with conditionals.  Never seen this documented or blogged about anywhere: http://pastebin.com/mAaHF6me
[13:41:03] <ringotwo> then do $('#weiter').click(function( { return false; } );
[13:41:23] <ringotwo> (inside a ready() block)
[13:41:35] <ringotwo> that should prevent the form from submitting when clicking the image button
[13:41:36] <jrcoco> ringotwo: Thanks, I'll try it out. I wasn't sure how to sent a POST request without a form except via PHP or something.
[13:43:23] <ringotwo> TehRabbitt, you have an extra opening curly brace below the alert line
[13:43:31] <ringotwo> you open the if block twice
[13:43:49] <sennahoj> hey, I have a question rearding swap(). I have a section wherein I want to swap a list of subelements. How do I achieve that?
[13:44:02] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: Can you please read through your code before bringing it here?
[13:44:14] <Eviltwin> sennahoj: You mean the built-in $.swap?
[13:44:37] <ringotwo> jrcoco, what are you trying to do, i'm not understanding
[13:44:59] <ringotwo> you're trying to implement the top solution in the stackoverflow question?
[13:45:46] <jrcoco> ringotwo: Correct. Specifically, I want Paypal to open in a lightbox.
[13:46:56] <sadmicrowave> ?demo
[13:46:57] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[13:47:50] <jrcoco> Paypal's API recommends you use a form which has a post action to send the information of what the user is purchasing. Lightboxes seem to be used primarily with images from links but I want to open an iframe from a form.
[13:48:01] <TehRabbitt> ringotwo: okay, so I read through it this time, and I fixed the { bracket but still no luck: http://pastebin.com/fcNEcryk
[13:48:19] <sennahoj> Eviltwin: I am trying to use swap in context with load() (actually I am using Sammy.js)

[13:48:43] <jrcoco> Basically when the form is submitted, the resulting contents appear in a lightbox and subsequent actions stay within the lightbox.
[13:49:06] <ringotwo> jrcoco, check out that link
[13:49:13] <ringotwo> that looks like what you want to do
[13:49:24] <Mkop> how can I enable a button in a UI dialog that I had created with buttons: [ {...disabled:true...} ]
[13:49:40] <TehRabbitt> ringotwo: when I hit submit, it runs the code above, and it's supposed to run the check, assign the " if there is a value, otherwise just blank it out so it doesn't print "undefined"
[13:49:48] <TehRabbitt> instead it gets to that, and just halts
[13:49:53] <todd_work> i have a div w/ overflow-y: scroll; every time i make an ajax call, the scrollbar flashes. anyone have a workaround for this?
[13:50:16] <ringotwo> TehRabbitt: what is myJQuery? where does that get set?
[13:51:02] <TehRabbitt> mJQuery is jQuery
[13:51:08] <TehRabbitt> myJQuery*
[13:51:20] <TehRabbitt> had to change the name of it due to RichFaces breaking things
[13:51:49] <ringotwo> please send where you define ScreenSize
[13:51:56] <TehRabbitt> http://pastebin.com/M7JvzVye
[13:52:03] <TehRabbitt> ringotwo: okay one sec
[13:52:24] <TehRabbitt> var ScreenSize = myJQuery("select[id*=screenSize]");
[13:53:26] <ringotwo> do you use firebug or chrome debugger?
[13:53:30] <TehRabbitt> firebug
[13:53:46] <TehRabbitt> I have persistant set / cleared it before hitting F5 then hit submit to see what happens
[13:53:48] <TehRabbitt> no errors
[13:54:01] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: We aren't here to point out JavaScript syntax errors. Please, learn to debug.
[13:54:51] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: so it *is* a syntax error?
[13:55:33] <ringotwo> that ScreenSize value could be wrong, i'm not sure
[13:55:51] <ringotwo> you have to learn to use the firebug or chrome debugger
[13:56:03] <Eviltwin> TehRabbitt: You've pasted at least one block of code that contained syntax errors
[13:56:10] <Eviltwin> ?ftj @ TehRabbitt
[13:56:10] <bot-t> TehRabbitt, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[13:56:14] <Eviltwin> I want you to read that through in detail
[13:57:59] <ThemNuts> Why do i get an error in firebug on line 55 of this script: http://pastebin.com/uJPGTkWr ? If i move it up one row the error stays on the same line.
[13:59:16] <ThemNuts> So seems like a syntax error but can't see whats wrong
[13:59:20] <ringotwo> ThemNuts, seems like a caching issue
[13:59:35] <ThemNuts> how is that?
[13:59:44] <ringotwo> if you move it up to line 54 and it still says it's no 55, that means the old javascript is still being used in your debugger
[13:59:48] <ringotwo> it happens sometimes
[13:59:51] <ThemNuts> cause hovering over the line in firebug gives me te values
[13:59:59] <ringotwo> you should get the Clear Cache button for firefox if you use that
[14:00:05] <ThemNuts> use ctrl+f5 to refresh
[14:00:29] <ringotwo> what's the error say
[14:00:45] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use chosen?
[14:00:51] <ThemNuts> cnt is not defined
[14:01:15] <ThemNuts> move it up one and it says $ is not defined
[14:02:20] <ringotwo> if you moved line 56 above line 55, then "cnt is not defined" makes sense
[14:02:57] <ringotwo> but moving line 55 to the empty line 54 and having that error makes no sense at all
[14:03:04] <ringotwo> i think you should restart your browser
[14:03:06] <ringotwo> and clear out your cache
[14:03:38] <ThemNuts> and there i went
[14:03:56] <ringotwo> try restarting your browser first?
[14:04:04] <ThemNuts> just did
[14:04:51] <ringotwo> same error?
[14:04:58] <ThemNuts> restarting helped, thanks
[14:05:02] <ringotwo> ah ok
[14:05:05] <ThemNuts> gives me 2 times te values now tough
[14:05:10] <ThemNuts> but not this part probably
[14:05:19] <ThemNuts> thanks ringotwo
[14:05:27] <ringotwo> np
[14:05:38] <ThemNuts> thought ctrl+F5 was good enough
[14:06:08] <ringotwo> i've noticed even the Clear Cache addon doens't always work
[14:06:22] <ringotwo> sometimes i have to restart
[14:06:26] <ThemNuts> i presume restarting browser works all of the time
[14:06:29] <ThemNuts> right
[14:07:10] <Chopps> ok guys, so i have 2 textareas, both can be resized(class resizeta) but only one can have line count function(class count), i have this http://jsfiddle.net/74bF4/1/ it works great on there, but when i put it on my test page it looks like this, http://gyazo.com/43f2bee676d11f762cf0469fcd63a424.png any idea why this happens?
[14:08:49] <Eviltwin> I think I might have written some of this code
[14:09:38] <Chopps> you did Eviltwin, u did the line count function
[14:09:40] <ringotwo> ThemNuts, i don't think quitting necessarily clears the cache?
[14:10:31] <ringotwo> hitting Control-R a couple of times ought to do it, though
[14:11:00] <ringotwo> the first time ought to reload the page from cache, the second time would force reload
[14:11:03] <ThemNuts> well learned another thing today. Takes to much of my times these little issues
[14:11:03] <ringotwo> at least for firefox

[14:19:17] <Eviltwin> $(".foo, .bar") selects all elements that have the class foo or the class bar (or both)
[14:20:14] <kaneda^> Eviltwin, when i put it in fiddle it worked, lols
[14:20:27] <kaneda^> i put a simplified version in of course
[14:20:32] <zatan_> Eviltwin, thanks thats really helped :)
[14:20:40] <nbari> I have already the form asking for the openid, when the submit buttom is clicked i use this  window.open to create a popup but later I would like to update the main windows with data from the popup windows
[14:20:43] <kaneda^> Eviltwin, anyways, i think i can figure it out now, thanks
[14:20:44] <Eviltwin> kaneda^: Then you're messing up somewhere else
[14:20:45] <Eviltwin> Keep trying
[14:20:49] <kaneda^> yep

[15:01:38] <Eviltwin> ?.each @ oojacoboo
[15:01:39] <bot-t> oojacoboo, .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[15:01:51] <Eviltwin> How have you not encountered .each yet?
[15:02:02] <oojacoboo> yea, well, kinda new to the jqueries
[15:02:04] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ oojacoboo
[15:02:04] <bot-t> oojacoboo, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[15:02:10] <kul> Eviltwin I already tried that
[15:02:21] <kaneda^> jsfiddle is dying for me
[15:02:50] <dwarder> for some reason my $(document).ajaxStop(function(){//stuff}  doesn't fire up, as i understand there are pending ajax requests, how can i find out which requasts are causing it
[15:02:57] <dwarder> requests*
[15:03:35] <Eviltwin> kul: This works just fine for me: http://jsfiddle.net/GWMsn/
[15:04:09] <kaneda^> Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/GzaDS can you load this? it's slow as shit for me
[15:04:31] <theBrettman> I think jsfiddle is overloaded. it's been slow for me too
[15:04:31] <Eviltwin> Try again
[15:04:33] <kaneda^> it JUST  loaded for me
[15:05:37] <kaneda^> it's taking forever to run anyting
[15:05:57] <Swimming_Bird> is there a reason the jquery events systemsupports things in such a way that the bind is mosre specific than the trigger. seems like the reverse makes more logical sense
[15:06:04] <kul> Eviltwin thanks :) I tried that before but it was not working I think I missed something when i tried it before
[15:06:09] <kul> its working fine now :)
[15:06:09] <Swimming_Bird> in that trigger('foo.bar.baz') would fire: 'foo','foo.bar','foo.bar.baz'
[15:06:13] <kul> Thank you very much
[15:07:07] <Eviltwin> Swimming_Bird: ?
[15:07:12] <Eviltwin> Oh
[15:07:26] <Eviltwin> It's because the suffixes are namespaces
[15:07:50] <Eviltwin> It's more of a mechanism for tracking who bound what
[15:08:11] <Eviltwin> For example being able to do $(elem).bind("click.foobar", ...)
[15:08:18] <Eviltwin> $(elem).bind("mouseover.foobar", ...)
[15:08:27] <Eviltwin> And then later $(elem).unbind("*.foobar");
[15:08:47] <Swimming_Bird> ah. so it's more for unbinding than for actually firing events
[15:09:21] <Eviltwin> When you specify namespaces, it triggers all those namespaces and the generic
[15:09:23] <kaneda^> Eviltwin, http://jsfiddle.net/GzaDS/20/ <-- this seems to work, and this is exactly what i do, only the table info comes from ajax
[15:09:24] <unclemantis> I need a little help with jQuery-Tags-Input
[15:09:32] <Eviltwin> If you bind to the generic, it gets everything regardless of namespace
[15:09:44] <unclemantis> i have the autocomplete part returning the query results but they are not displaying in the drop down
[15:11:32] <unclemantis> https://gist.github.com/92b1e534b2db6afde39b
[15:11:52] <unclemantis> does the JSON string look right?
[15:11:57] <theBrettman> I kind of found my problem. each(index,element) element is returning the eventHandle?
[15:12:26] <b-lew> Can I score some help. I want my div int-sidebar to always be the same height as the browser window. I would love any help if that is at all possible . http://karmic.equalomaha.org/appointments/
[15:13:35] <b-lew> is that at all possible?
[15:14:05] <Eviltwin> $(window).resize(function(){$("div.int-sidebar").height($(window).height())}).resize();
[15:15:23] <b-lew> wow thanks Eviltwin. i'll try this out
[15:15:50] <Eviltwin> b-lew: http://jsfiddle.net/eFaZ3/

[15:21:56] <Eviltwin> b-lew: Nix the min-height?
[15:22:04] <b-lew> okay
[15:22:05] <b-lew> one sec
[15:22:10] <theBrettman> localName is the tag name in lowercase
[15:22:30] <theBrettman> the class is only on one element...
[15:22:48] <Eviltwin> theBrettman: 'Cause $(...) produces a jQuery collection

[15:28:27] <b-lew> Sorry I'm not good at Jquery... I'm trying...
[15:28:42] <abjorn> coldhead: was playing LoL, just saw that lol
[15:28:42] <bot-t> (25 hours 30 mins ago) <imsky> tell abjorn 2012 IS THE YEAR OF JABOSCRIPT
[15:29:17] <Swimming_Bird> b-lew: jquery does selectors from right to left though. so you may have to get pretty specific.
[15:29:42] <coldhead> you should follow her, abjorn
[15:29:45] <Eviltwin> Swimming_Bird: $("table > tbody > tr > td") ?
[15:29:48] <Eviltwin> Err
[15:29:53] <abjorn> maybe i will
[15:29:56] <Eviltwin> spikku: $("table > tbody > tr > td") ?
[15:29:57] <abjorn> i have no idea who that is
[15:30:09] <coldhead> i have no idea but she's good value

[15:30:16] <bot-t> abjorn, Okay.
[15:30:17] <coldhead> and she gets wigglin
[15:30:21] <spikku> Eviltwin, yeah I was just trying that, I get the selector option now, thank you Eviltwin and Swimming_Bird
[15:30:26] <Swimming_Bird> that seems like an excessive selector. what are you actually trying to do?
[15:30:42] <Swimming_Bird> 'table > tbody >tr > td" if you're using that. you're probably doing something wrong
[15:31:05] <Swimming_Bird> do you have tables w/in tables?

[15:31:53] <Swimming_Bird> you'd have to run it in a real page probably. but i'm not sure
[15:32:12] <b-lew> Swimming_Bird: Well its not working on either page... bummmer...
[15:32:36] <Swimming_Bird> try using bind('resize',fn) trigger('resize)
[15:32:54] <Swimming_Bird> once you get it working i'd also toss in there a throttle: http://documentcloud.github.com/underscore/#throttle

[15:58:54] <etgregor> en mi vida de programador hay un antes y un después de jquere jeje
[16:03:04] <TehRabbitt> idk what to do :-\ i've spent almost an hour now trying to add simple quotes to the end of something before passing it through, or even just "in." but nothing is working right
[16:03:13] <TehRabbitt> 17in. for instance
[16:03:15] <TehRabbitt> or 17"
[16:03:58] <TehRabbitt> I get the number (screen size) by calling: var ScreenSize = myJQuery("select[id*=screenSize]");
[16:04:07] <TehRabbitt> so ScreenSize.val() is the size (lets say 17)
[16:04:31] <TehRabbitt> so when I call (ScreenSize.val() || '') and try to print it, it prints "17"
[16:04:46] <aghouseh> quick question about firebug. im trying to trace a click binding on an element, but I cant seem to pare down from the Object { events={...}, handle=function()}, etc in the firebug HTML panel to where it's actually being bound. this possible?
[16:04:46] <TehRabbitt> now lets say I want to add "in." to the end of 17
[16:05:20] <TehRabbitt> (ScreenSize.val() +"in." || '') does print it as "17in." HOWEVER... it always prints "undefined in." because it evaluates true
[16:05:31] <TehRabbitt> how can I fix this?
[16:05:54] <TehRabbitt> it seems simple enough, yet I can't seem to figure it out :(
[16:06:17] <Eviltwin> ScreenSize.val() ? ScreenSize.val() + "in." : ''
[16:07:04] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: what does the ? do?
[16:07:10] <Eviltwin> ?w ?:
[16:07:11] <bot-t> Eviltwin, ?: - In computer programming, ?: is a ternary operator that is part of the syntax for a basic conditional expression in several programming languages. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/?:
[16:07:44] <TehRabbitt> well || is or, and && is and, so what would the equivilant of ? be?
[16:07:52] <Eviltwin> ...
[16:08:13] <Eviltwin> It's the equivalent of if-else
[16:08:18] <TehRabbitt> oh
[16:08:18] <Eviltwin> Except inline
[16:08:21] <TehRabbitt> hm cool
[16:08:25] <TehRabbitt> TIL
[16:09:28] <TehRabbitt> Eviltwin: Thank you! :-D  i'm jotting down that expression... it's good to know :-D
[16:09:42] <Eviltwin> Welcome to programming
[16:11:18] <theBrettman> ok, another problem fixed. it was cuz I wasn't wrapping my variable in $()
[16:11:55] <dwarder> it is like not wrapping a gift !!!
[16:12:11] <Eviltwin> Always use $() protection
[16:12:16] <Eviltwin> Even double layer if needed
[16:12:22] <Eviltwin> $($(element))
[16:12:45] <theBrettman> rofl
[16:12:55] <theBrettman> it won't break if it wears two? lol
[16:14:37] <theBrettman> I'm having problems with parentsUntil('#element).each(function(i,el)
[16:14:56] <theBrettman> it only returns the parent element instead of each
[16:15:01] <theBrettman> trying to prepend them
[16:15:19] <dwarder> maybe it is underage?
[16:15:36] <theBrettman> http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/UHGUC/
[16:15:48] <dwarder> that is why parent comes
[16:16:00] <Eviltwin> $('.selectedElement').parentsUntil($('#canvas').each(...)) ?
[16:16:02] <Eviltwin> That?
[16:16:07] <theBrettman> yep
[16:16:53] <Eviltwin> And what's your plan with that?
[16:17:22] <theBrettman> it's going to lay out the heirarchy of the selected element in my properties panel
[16:17:50] <theBrettman> it should prepend each parent on each iteration
[16:18:01] <Eviltwin> So your plan it to touch each element up to the #canvas?
[16:18:21] <theBrettman> instead, l returns #canvas on first iteration
[16:18:25] <Eviltwin> Yup
[16:18:35] <Eviltwin> $('.selectedElement').parentsUntil($('#canvas').each(...))
[16:18:37] <Eviltwin> Decompose that
[16:18:37] <theBrettman> yeah, I have no clue why, lol
[16:18:47] <Eviltwin> Do you know the order things execute in there?
[16:19:06] <theBrettman> not sure what order it should be in. that was the most confusing part
[16:19:14] <theBrettman> there's a lot going on there, lol
[16:19:22] <theBrettman> so my each is in the wrong spot?
[16:19:36] <Eviltwin> What is the .each acting on there?
[16:20:00] <theBrettman> each parent?
[16:20:11] <Eviltwin> Literally, what is it called on
[16:20:26] <theBrettman> oh
[16:20:33] <theBrettman> aha
[16:20:43] <theBrettman> I'm missing some ()
[16:20:44] <Eviltwin> So what should it look like?
[16:21:06] <theBrettman> or at least )
[16:22:30] <theBrettman> that was it. finally!
[16:22:34] <theBrettman> can't believe I missed that!
[16:23:05] <theBrettman> sweet relief! I spent my freetime yesterday and today trying to figure all this out! but I'm learning!
[16:23:25] <theBrettman> hopefully that's the last holdup, cuz I still have so much to do!
[16:24:19] <theBrettman> next, I have to make it so you can click on heirarchy to select a parent. hope this goes smooth
[16:24:44] <theBrettman> I wonder what's with the JSLint unexpected string error?
[16:25:52] <eddiemonge> is it an unexpected string?
[16:26:03] <Eviltwin> I didn't expect that string
[16:26:13] <Eviltwin> Caught me totally off guard
[16:27:40] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[16:28:00] <ProLoser|Work> anyone around/
[16:28:09] <Eviltwin> Why?
[16:29:02] <ProLoser|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/ProLoser/XhYFY/
[16:29:05] <ProLoser|Work> having trouble with this
[16:29:18] <ProLoser|Work> it's supposed to be a bunch of tabs
[16:29:27] <ProLoser|Work> and when you click on one, it's panel opens up
[16:29:37] <ProLoser|Work> and the tabs below it slide down
[16:29:48] <ProLoser|Work> the animation is completely broken
[16:29:59] <ThemNuts> sup guys, i have this autocomplete function that fills some input forms and if there is more then one value it adds input fields accordingly. When i enter data in the autosuggest and the given data doesn't have the extra input fields i want to delete them. Is there a function in jQuery that does that?
[16:30:00] <ProLoser|Work> i also want the currently active tab to stay on the left of it's corresponding panel
[16:30:11] <ThemNuts> ie: delete inserted DOM on new autocomplete
[16:30:22] <ThemNuts> tried .remove() but doesn't seem to work
[16:30:41] <kaneda^> Eviltwin, fixed it
[16:30:48] <redsquare> ProLoser|Work, whats the second param your giving to addClass
[16:31:07] <kaneda^> Eviltwin, i forgot to trigger an update after redraw, thus the tablesorter saw no rows to sort and gave that error
[16:31:09] <theBrettman> proloser, your div is actually being inserted above the link
[16:31:24] <Eviltwin> redsquare: I believe it's a jQuery feature that allows you to animate the addition or removal of a class
[16:31:28] <Eviltwin> jQuery UI*
[16:31:36] <redsquare> oh, grim
[16:32:08] <redsandro> I have seen the use of: $.elementId = {object};
[16:32:09] <redsandro> What is it for? I cannot find it in the documentation
[16:32:30] <eddiemonge> ThemNuts: how did you try to use .remove()?
[16:32:58] <ThemNuts> http://pastebin.com/KRGr8DMK
[16:33:26] <redsquare> is there not a separate ui room anymore?
[16:33:27] <theBrettman> oh nvm, he made it that way, lol
[16:33:37] <theBrettman> there is but no one goes in it
[16:33:38] <coldhead> no redsy, this is it
[16:33:38] <theBrettman> lol
[16:33:43] <coldhead> they got merged
[16:33:45] <redsquare> hey coldhead
[16:33:54] <coldhead> to my unending dismay
[16:33:58] <ThemNuts> i fill in a name and enters the data using the prepend. Then i fill in a name that doesn't have the extra data but doesn't trigger the remove
[16:34:00] <theBrettman> they got lonely and came here
[16:34:01] <redsquare> haha, yeh
[16:34:24] <redsandro> No one knows that trick? It seems a shorthand of sorts but I don't really get it
[16:34:24] <redsandro> $.myId1 = { '0': $([]), 'myId2': $('#myId3') };
[16:34:30] <redsandro> What does it mean?
[16:34:30] <coldhead> telling people to take their stupid UI problems to the UI channel was basically all i ever did
[16:34:34] <coldhead> and now my life has no purpose
[16:35:49] <redsandro> I didn't mean to be rude, but the topic said: "Just ask!"
[16:35:52] <redsandro> So uhm..
[16:35:54] <redsandro> Hi :)
[16:35:54] <coldhead> redsandro: you mean what does $([]) mean?
[16:36:04] <redsquare> redsandro, try it in the browser console
[16:36:12] <redsquare> then inspect the $
[16:36:18] <redsandro> Also, but specifically that notation, I cannot find it in the docs
[16:36:26] <eddiemonge> ThemNuts: did you read the documentation for it? see ? remove
[16:36:27] <bot-t> ThemNuts, .remove([selector]): Remove the set of matched elements from the DOM. http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[16:36:35] <Eviltwin> redsandro: Where have you seen this used?
[16:36:52] <redsquare> nettuts probs
[16:37:01] <redsandro> Eviltwin: Some form, it is supposed to bind form elements together
[16:37:19] <ThemNuts> the second example is exactly like mine not?
[16:37:49] <eddiemonge> ThemNuts: the way you have it, it is trying to remove an element with id TextBoxesGroup that also has an id of bedrijftelnr
[16:38:02] <ThemNuts> ow
[16:38:04] <coldhead> redsandro: i have used that notation to create an empty jQuery set so i can still call jQuery methods on it without anything breaking later
[16:38:11] <eddiemonge> ThemNuts: and you are adding multiple elements with the same id
[16:38:13] <Eviltwin> If it is what you wrote, I'm pretty sure they're just abusing the jQuery namespace in a way they shouldn't be
[16:38:28] <ThemNuts> yeah
[16:38:32] <coldhead> var x = $([]); x.remove() works fine; var x = null; x.remove() shits itself
[16:38:41] <redsandro> Eviltwin: I know the $("selector").function() notation, but the $.ElementId = {...} is new for me
[16:39:04] <Eviltwin> As I said, they're abusing the namespace in a way they shouldn't
[16:39:13] <Eviltwin> It's like doing window.ElementId = {...}
[16:39:20] <ThemNuts> works now but leaves empty space where they were
[16:39:26] <Eviltwin> Just using it as a place to store stuff where they can refer to it later
[16:39:43] <Eviltwin> Which they shouldn't do
[16:39:55] <redsandro> Then the second part that is new to me is that it binds the data
[16:39:58] <Eviltwin> It's a bad practice
[16:40:01] <redsquare> redsandro, - you can see if you use firebug and type it in the console
[16:40:11] <redsquare> but yeah as Eviltwin says, not good
[16:41:32] <redsandro> coldhead: Why would you need a set like $([])? (just trying to catch up with this new stuff I see around :))
[16:41:54] <Eviltwin> redsandro: You can use .bind and .trigger on it emulate a pub-sub pattern
[16:42:02] <redsandro> ah ok
[16:42:09] <Eviltwin> ?g jquery tiny pub sub @ redsandro
[16:42:11] <bot-t> redsandro, jQuery Tiny Pub/Sub: A really, really, REALLY tiny pub/sub ... - https://gist.github.com/661855
[16:42:24] <red_square> never understood that ^^
[16:42:40] <coldhead> redsandro: when i have a code path that might or might not result in any matches and then subsequent code needs to run on that set regardless
[16:42:54] <coldhead> it's not common but it can ever happen
[16:43:07] <redsandro> I see
[16:43:07] <red_square> postman ftw
[16:43:17] <redsandro> I found another of those usages

[16:44:32] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: Looks like a clusterfuck to me, personally
[16:44:48] <ProLoser|Work> well how would you achieve something like that?
[16:44:53] <red_square> redsandro close that article now
[16:45:03] <Eviltwin> ProLoser|Work: Missed what exactly you wanted to achieve
[16:45:09] <ProLoser|Work> i also need it to be sticky (switch to pos:fix) when you scroll
[16:45:18] <ProLoser|Work> expandable panel on the right side
[16:45:19] <coldhead> redsandro: you see why they have the $([]) there, right?
[16:45:26] <ProLoser|Work> that expands cards when you click on the icon
[16:45:32] <coldhead> so they can call show() on empty sets and it won't break
[16:46:37] <wardrop> What's the best way to submit javascript objects with a form? The form contains normal form elements like textfield's, but there's also a javascript object I want to submit with the form. Do I have to write out this object as hidden form field before the forms submitted?
[16:47:10] <Eviltwin> wardrop: JSON.stringify
[16:47:25] <redsandro> coldhead: Ohhh so that .something might as well be var lalalala = { (that object) }
[16:47:36] <redsandro> i mean $.something
[16:47:50] <oojacoboo> hey guys, how might I go about binding for a sortable event?
[16:47:56] <redsandro> $.something just adds a variable to the $ object
[16:48:02] <oojacoboo> .on('sortable', function())?
[16:48:03] <Eviltwin> Correct
[16:48:06] <coldhead> yes
[16:48:09] <oojacoboo> cool
[16:48:10] <redsandro> I guess I was a little too slow to figure that out
[16:48:21] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: see ?g ajpiano widget factory
[16:48:22] <bot-t> oojacoboo, jQuery UI Widget Factory - http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/
[16:48:27] <wardrop> Eviltwin: Ideally, I'd like to be able to submit the object as actual POST data. So if the object was: {name: 'Bill',  age: 25}, I want to submit the form with post data name=Bill&age=25 for example
[16:48:36] <Eviltwin> wardrop: see $.param
[16:48:40] <Eviltwin> wardrop: see ?$.param
[16:48:41] <bot-t> wardrop, jQuery.param() - Create a serialized representation of an array or object, suitable for use in a URL query string or Ajax request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.param/
[16:48:42] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: already seen that
[16:48:44] <oojacoboo> thanks though
[16:48:50] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: It tells you how to do it
[16:48:55] <oojacoboo> ok
[16:49:06] <wardrop> Otherwise the JSON.stringify will do the trick I guess.
[16:49:12] <wardrop> bot-t: Looking into that now...
[16:49:12] <bot-t> wardrop, .delegate() - Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[16:50:01] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: It's covered on a slide in the teens :P
[16:50:16] <oojacoboo> yea, thanks
[16:50:41] <redsandro> coldhead: red_square: Evil_twin: Thanks for helping. I got it now. Namespaceabusing. Happy. Thanks.
[16:51:11] <dialtone> hi, does anybody have any problems with nightly chromium builds and jquery 1.7.1 used in extensions?
[16:51:26] <dialtone> I get a Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'compareDocumentPosition' of null and my extension doesn't work anymore
[16:51:51] <coldhead> good luck redsandro!
[16:51:54] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: I don't see it but w/e
[16:52:47] <LekeFly> Whats the "best" way to style a select list? eg what js plugin
[16:52:54] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: It's there
[16:53:18] <Eviltwin> It's related to _trigger
[16:54:55] <wardrop> bot-t: $.param is good, except how do I append it to the data that's submitted by the form? To clarify, this won't be done as an ajax request, but rather a standard form submission.
[16:54:56] <bot-t> wardrop, Stored "$.param".
[16:55:15] <Eviltwin> wardrop: What are the first three character's of bot-t's nick?
[16:55:30] <Eviltwin> characters*
[16:56:03] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[16:56:14] <coldhead> bot-t: forget $.param
[16:56:14] <bot-t> coldhead, Forgot "$.param".
[16:56:26] <ColKurtz> to scroll to the top of the document, should I use $(document).scrollTop(0)? $(window)? $('html, body') ?
[16:56:39] <Eviltwin> I believe $("html, body") is the best
[16:57:57] <eddiemonge> window.scroll(0,0) ?
[17:02:25] <ColKurtz> $(window).scrollTop(0); seems to work
[17:04:07] <Eviltwin> ColKurtz: Make sure it works in both something WebKit and something Mozilla
[17:04:15] <ColKurtz> yup
[17:04:23] <Chopps> hey guys, so i have 2 textareas, both can be resized(class resizeta) but only one can have line count function(class count), i have this http://jsfiddle.net/74bF4/1/ it works great on there, but when i put it on my test page it looks like this, http://gyazo.com/43f2bee676d11f762cf0469fcd63a424.png any idea why this happens?
[17:05:51] <Eviltwin> Chopps: Nope
[17:15:08] <JD-Robbs> If I remove a tables last row with tr:last and then try it again the second time won't find it. Is there anything I need to "refresh"? Many thanks :)
[17:15:34] <Eviltwin> JD-Robbs: Can you make a jsFiddle example of your problem?
[17:15:36] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ JD-Robbs
[17:15:37] <bot-t> JD-Robbs, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:16:13] <JD-Robbs> Oh perfect, thanks - on the case :)
[17:17:05] <Eviltwin> Keep it small, illustrate the specific issue, don't just dump your whole page into it
[17:19:43] <JD-Robbs> Nono, I already re-generated it to get rid of a bizillion hidden inputs and things :) ... Unfortunately it won't reproduce it. I'll spend some more time on it, thanks Eviltwin :)
[17:21:57] <JD-Robbs> Ah damn, what am I like. I hadn't selected jQuery :D
[17:22:15] <Eviltwin> Yeah, we all forget that every once in a while
[17:28:18] <nwilson5> if anyone can help... I have an ajaxComplete event that I want to perform something - is there a way to make it only perform the function once/break out of it? It seems to repeat the function multiple times.
[17:28:41] <nwilson5> I am still fairly new to this, so trying to work out small quirks
[17:31:09] <Eviltwin> nwilson5: Perhaps you should see ?.one
[17:31:10] <bot-t> nwilson5, .one(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. The handler is executed at most once per element. http://api.jquery.com/one/
[17:31:44] <nwilson5> thanks i'll look into it
[17:37:20] <b-lew> I'm running this code on my site… http://pastie.org/3204877 and it doesn't seem to be fully working on pages that don't have a lot of content on them… http://karmic.equalomaha.org/meet/  thoughts? I just want the sidebar to be the same height as the browser but the #wrapper isn't always the same height.
[17:38:39] <eddiemonge> b-lew: why not just make the sidebar position: fixed; height: 100% ?
[17:39:04] <b-lew> heh tried it… long story
[17:39:15] <b-lew> didn't work cause of the background image needing to be stretched
[17:39:38] <b-lew> plus it looked bad on a ipad when doing that
[17:40:26] <eddiemonge> then you need to check the height for each of the elements first and only resize if its shorter than x. a min-height helps too
[17:41:12] <b-lew> well i think my jquery isn't working right cause i have it set to have #wrapper be the same height as body then my #int-sidebar to be the same as #wrapper
[17:41:24] <b-lew> seems like it would work just fine but no dice
[17:41:49] <eddiemonge> is your body element set to height: 100% margin/padding: 0?
[17:42:43] <nwilson5> worked like a charm Eviltwin thanks for the pointer
[17:43:14] <OomElvis> q: how would i go  about getting a return value from $.ajax ?
[17:43:24] <OomElvis> i want to know if it was successful or not
[17:43:34] <OomElvis> i was thinking of using the responseText
[17:43:43] <OomElvis> but i dont want to use eval() to parse it
[17:43:51] <OomElvis> any other methods?
[17:44:01] <eddiemonge> OomElvis: do you need to know if it was successful? if so, then just use the success callback
[17:44:11] <b-lew> yes they are eddiemonge
[17:44:18] <OomElvis> i need to use $(this)
[17:44:25] <eddiemonge> OomElvis: for what?
[17:44:33] <OomElvis> $(this).parent().parent().hide(); .. which doesnt work inside the success()
[17:45:04] <OomElvis> or maybe parent x 3 would work in there
[17:46:02] <eddiemonge> OomElvis: what is $(this)?
[17:46:26] <OomElvis> an <a>
[17:46:27] <b-lew> I think its my css…
[17:46:43] <OomElvis> eddiemonge: an <a>
[17:46:54] <eddiemonge> if you want it to be an element outside of the success callback, then you need to declare it. $this = $(this); and then in the callback use $this. its all about scope
[17:47:00] <eddiemonge> b-lew: i think it is too
[17:47:23] <b-lew> body and wrapper aren't going 100%
[17:47:26] <b-lew> http://karmic.equalomaha.org/appointments/
[17:47:35] <eddiemonge> b-lew: if you add overflow auto they will
[17:47:49] <b-lew> to html?
[17:48:42] <OomElvis> eddiemonge: sweet, works well (:
[17:48:44] <OomElvis> thanks
[17:49:06] <eddiemonge> b-lew: to the body
[17:49:21] <b-lew> yea i did that.
[17:49:24] <b-lew> no dice
[17:49:27] <b-lew> hrmmmm
[17:50:54] <b-lew> well everything looks right, i'll keep checking
[17:51:38] <b-lew> body and wrapper are both 100% looks okay
[17:51:43] <b-lew> js error maybe?
[17:52:35] <dwarder> is that statement right: $(document).ajaxStop wont fire up if ajax's returned js gave this error "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property"
[17:52:59] <kawohi> I need some help.... If someone can help me with this question.... that would be great http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8899352/fetching-more-data-from-database/8899969#8899969 I really need to learn how to do this in the next 24 hours to pay my bill :/
[17:53:00] <eddiemonge> ?tias
[17:53:00] <bot-t> Try It And See
[17:54:42] <kawohi> please help :/
[17:55:16] <eddiemonge> kawohi: this is for a job you are doing?
[17:56:38] <kawohi> Yes, and it is almost complete. I just need to know how to fetch the next results of data. I could just load all of it, but with the facebook like button,,, it'll take forever to load the site
[17:57:06] <eddiemonge> kawohi: you took a job for money that you didnt know how to do?
[17:57:34] <jcblitz> For http://api.jquery.com/on/, if I use something like $("body").live('ajax:success', ".trash-can", function(evt, data, status, xhr) {…}, how can I access the .trash-can object?
[17:57:57] <kawohi> Lol, well I knew how to do some of it, and yeah. It's not for some company or whatever. it's for a single client. and It's forcing me to learn how to do this so I'm learning while trying to do it. It's almost complete
[17:58:38] <eddiemonge> jcblitz: first, .live() is not .on(). live is deprecated. second, .trash0can isnt an object. its a selector to match to dom elements
[17:58:39] <jcblitz> nm, figured it out. evt.target. Figures I ask for help and solve it
[17:59:46] <kawohi> I really need some help :/ or at-least help to figure out why his answer, when it says to load in the URL it gives an error undefined variable....
[18:00:25] <eddiemonge> kawohi: overview: you have the show more link fire an ajax event that calls a php page that returns a html dataset, or a json dataset. then you use the ajax's success callback to append the content to the page. or use the error callback to state what failed
[18:00:58] <eddiemonge> undefined variable means you are getting back data that has an undefined variable
[18:00:59] <kawohi> Okay, I get that. It's the same as his answer on s.o right"?
[18:01:07] <eddiemonge> what is your call and what is the data being returned?
[18:01:27] <kawohi> yeah, in his answer its array_push($data, $record);
[18:01:37] <kawohi> which $record hasn't never been used before
[18:02:03] <eddiemonge> kawohi: this is #jQuery, not #php.
[18:02:19] <kawohi> I know, I tried to go to #php but it says I need to be invited...
[18:02:30] <eddiemonge> if you need help learning php, you should read some tutorials on it or go to ##php. I can tell you whats wrong with the returned data from the JS side
[18:03:41] <raj> how can I wrap all $('[data-custom*="autocomplete"]') with a div?
[18:03:53] <raj> $('[data-custom*="autocomplete"]').wrap(<div></div>) doesn't work
[18:04:15] <raj> oh, syntax error
[18:04:16] <raj> nm
[18:04:46] <eddiemonge> wow that is a crazy inefficient selector raj
[18:05:01] <eddiemonge> you should perhaps maybe use a class instead
[18:05:08] <raj> it does have a class
[18:05:15] <raj> i just left it out for sake of example :)
[18:05:24] <raj> oh
[18:05:24] <raj> wait
[18:05:25] <raj> no
[18:05:27] <raj> it doesn't
[18:05:35] <b-lew> anyone want to help with a simple problem?
[18:05:42] <raj> it only selects items with data-custom="autocomplete" attribute
[18:05:48] <raj> which is only like 10 things
[18:06:13] <raj> eddiemonge, how is that worse than a class?
[18:06:17] <raj> seems to do the same thing
[18:07:48] <eddiemonge> raj: it goes through every element looking at all attributes with a regex on those, then it does a regex on all the values as well.
[18:08:14] <eddiemonge> as opposed to looking for class, which is often super fast if the browser supports the native getElebyclass
[18:10:01] <b-lew> does this look right ?http://pastie.org/3204877
[18:10:39] <eddiemonge> you dont need the div in the int-sidebar selector
[18:10:49] <raj> gotcha eddiemonge, guess I'll do that instead then
[18:10:57] <oojacoboo> can someone point me in the right direction here with these binding events… http://jsfiddle.net/dTRNh/3/
[18:11:57] <eddiemonge> b-lew: and i say its your starting heights that are off. do console.log( $('#wrapper').height(), $('body').height(), $("#int-sidebar").height() );  and see what it says first
[18:12:06] <eddiemonge> before you try changing the height
[18:13:06] <b-lew> okay bare with me jquery learner. but i'm trying. i'll check it real quick
[18:13:31] <b-lew> it looks i have 2 scroll bars which is odd
[18:13:49] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: what do you think $(event.originalTarget) should be giving you?
[18:14:04] <eddiemonge> b-lew: that might be because of the overflow: auto i told you to add
[18:14:07] <oojacoboo> #status-list-sortable
[18:14:12] <eddiemonge> i have a feeling your css needs works
[18:14:15] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: its not
[18:14:24] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/dTRNh/4/
[18:14:56] <oojacoboo> awesome
[18:15:14] <oojacoboo> just use $(this) ?
[18:15:37] <b-lew> i took out the overflow auto now
[18:15:41] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: do you know what .closest() does?
[18:15:49] <b-lew> and my #wrapper is what is keeping it from moving
[18:16:09] <b-lew> #wrapper{ float:left; width:100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; padding: 0; position:relative; }
[18:17:04] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: ugh… yea, that's not what I need
[18:17:10] <b-lew> thats okay i think
[18:17:35] <frenocha> what would be the sane (read: non-eval()) version of doing something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/MZdQE/ (a calculator that outputs the calculation of input1 to input2)
[18:18:07] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: that's still only a small piece of the issue
[18:18:09] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: maybe you want something more like http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/dTRNh/5/
[18:18:32] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: read this page http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[18:18:46] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: I am following that
[18:18:52] <eddiemonge> b-lew: why do you have a float left on it?
[18:18:57] <oojacoboo> I see what you mean with ui.item htough
[18:19:59] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: it appears my current issue, aside from that one, is the binding
[18:20:19] <oojacoboo> I hadn't gotten to that other yet
[18:20:54] <b-lew> i thought itd help… i'll take it off
[18:21:20] <wardrop> Eviltwin: That would explain the unusual and quite unhelpful responses. It's not exactly clear that bot-t is a bot. I'm use to seeing actual users containing bot in their username.
[18:23:31] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: the sortstart bind works, but the sortstop does not, do you have to unbind in this instance?
[18:23:51] <oojacoboo> damnit… typo fml
[18:24:32] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: heres a cleaner way to write it http://jsfiddle.net/eddiemonge/dTRNh/7/
[18:24:44] <eddiemonge> there isnt a sortstart event
[18:25:00] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: that isn't binding
[18:25:11] <oojacoboo> that won't work when the DOM refreshes
[18:25:23] <eddiemonge> wardrop: its not clear that bot-t is a bot? people who have bot in their name are dumb
[18:25:26] <oojacoboo> and according to the UI docs, there is a sortstart and stop event
[18:25:37] <interlocutor> anyone here familiar with datatables?
[18:25:48] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: where? http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#events
[18:25:59] <interlocutor> I'm wondering if datatables has a feature to autosort upon table load
[18:26:00] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: show examples
[18:26:06] <oojacoboo> details*
[18:26:16] <oojacoboo> $( ".selector" ).bind( "sortstart", function(event, ui) {
[18:26:39] <interlocutor> oojacoboo: was that for me?
[18:26:45] <oojacoboo> no
[18:27:08] <interlocutor> ah ok
[18:27:19] <kawohi_> okay so I fixed that problem. I now get json results by going to /quotes.php?start=0&limit=10 but, after copying pasting his code which is jquery/ajax, nothing happens.
[18:27:34] <oojacoboo> interlocutor: but to answer your question, I believe so
[18:27:37] <oojacoboo> IIRC
[18:27:51] <eddiemonge> kawohi_: dont just copy and paste. you have to make it work for your code
[18:28:03] <interlocutor> to claify for anyone though, this is a purely HTML table that I'd like to be able to add in any order and have the column sorted alphabetically upon page load
[18:28:43] <interlocutor> I think I found it
[18:28:44] <interlocutor> oojacoboo
[18:28:49] <interlocutor> http://datatables.net/ref#sType
[18:28:51] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: youre right. those are the types. it doesnt work in your fiddle because you have a typo. ill leave it up to you to find
[18:28:53] <kawohi_> eddiemonge: I know, I'm trying, I' don't like to copy paste ether. I'm just trying to speed this up cuz I'm running out of time...
[18:29:13] <oojacoboo> interlocutor: http://live.datatables.net/omunip
[18:29:18] <oojacoboo> ugh
[18:29:20] <eddiemonge> kawohi_: maybe you should hire a contractor then if the deadline is that close
[18:29:30] <oojacoboo> http://live.datatables.net/omunip/edit#javascript,html
[18:29:48] <kawohi_> my deadline is the bill I need to pay :/
[18:29:56] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: yea, I corrected that, always my luck
[18:30:15] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: what was missing so i know you found the right one?
[18:30:23] <oojacoboo> the hash
[18:30:27] <interlocutor> oojacoboo: awesome thanks!
[18:30:39] <eddiemonge> yup. but did you also see how i wrote it diffent in the last example?
[18:30:52] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: yes, but that doesn't allow me to bind
[18:30:57] <oojacoboo> that's how I had it
[18:31:08] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: yes it does. thats the first way to bind
[18:31:11] <oojacoboo> I'm reloading the DOM after a sort, so I need to bind it
[18:31:20] <oojacoboo> mmm
[18:31:33] <eddiemonge> why are you reloading the dom?
[18:31:47] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: b/c I'm saving the results of the sort to the db
[18:31:55] <kawohi_> also, I think everything looks  right in his code....
[18:32:13] <oojacoboo> not the full dom, just that portion
[18:32:35] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: you are replacing the ul, the li or the something else?
[18:32:45] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: and it sounds like you need to event delegate
[18:32:47] <oojacoboo> well, much more than that
[18:32:56] <eddiemonge> ? demo @ kawohi_
[18:32:56] <bot-t> kawohi_, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:32:59] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: yes, that's what .on() does
[18:33:07] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: again, no it does
[18:33:09] <oojacoboo> but I need to delegate to a parent higher up the dom
[18:33:11] <eddiemonge> *doesnt
[18:33:15] <kawohi_> okay I shall...
[18:33:21] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: not the way you have it.
[18:33:27] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: right
[18:33:34] <oojacoboo> I need to delegate higher up the DOM tree
[18:33:43] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: seriously, go to http://api.jquery.com/on and read the whole page. three times
[18:33:58] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: I know what you're saying
[18:34:27] <eddiemonge> oojacoboo: i remember saying to you that the way you had on() wasnt a delegation way yesterday or this weekend or sometime in the past
[18:34:55] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: I don't think so, but it's possible I guess
[18:35:06] <eddiemonge> maybe it was earlier today then
[18:35:11] <oojacoboo> na
[18:35:15] <oojacoboo> maybe 2 months ago :P
[18:35:25] <eddiemonge> nope. it was recent. past week
[18:35:30] <eddiemonge> past few days
[18:35:42] <eddiemonge> but whatev. time for me to go home
[18:39:03] <kawohi_> okayy http://kdevs.site40.net/ clicking "get more quotes" doesnt do anything
[18:39:43] <xp_prg> hi all, I am wanting to work with easyslider but I am confused how it works
[18:40:05] <xp_prg> I can control the links that advance the slides
[18:40:16] <xp_prg> but what is actually happening to the slides, I assume they are being shifted?
[18:43:16] <kawohi_> So can you help me out...?
[18:53:04] <xp_prg> gnarf are you here?
[18:57:35] <xp_prg> I have this: $('#slider').easySlider; but I don't know how to get anything inside of it
[18:59:35] <interlocutor> get what inside of what?
[18:59:42] <interlocutor> images inside of easy slider?
[18:59:54] <xp_prg> well I want to check if the easy slider is working programatically
[19:00:15] <interlocutor> the fuck does that mean? you want to load a webpage and see if the shit is sliding?
[19:00:28] <xp_prg> I look at the code and it appears to set the class to current and stuff
[19:01:07] <xp_prg> so like it is modifying a div, I figured out how to make it click and move to the next slide with:  $('a', '#slider1prev').click();
[19:01:13] <xp_prg> but how do I know it worked?
[19:01:33] <interlocutor> firebug has a script trace
[19:01:51] <interlocutor> you can even just view the DOM directly
[19:02:07] <theBrettman> how do I return delete key?
[19:02:09] <xp_prg> this gives the code in chrome: $('#slider').easySlider;
[19:02:15] <interlocutor> http://getfirebug.com/javascript
[19:02:41] <xp_prg> interlocutor I am trying to understand how it is modifying the DOM
[19:03:38] <bradmaxs> I am getting an Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token . in my jquery.ui.stars.css file?  Not sure how to debug or what that even means.
[19:03:38] <interlocutor> AHEM: http://getfirebug.com/javascript
[19:03:53] <xp_prg> I am in firebug, in the DOM tab trying to figure it out
[19:03:58] <kawohi_> grrrr it no worx!
[19:06:17] <theBrettman> anyone know how I can tell if the delete key was pressed?
[19:06:40] <theBrettman> nvm
[19:07:49] <bobbobbins> hey, i have some fields that are dynamically generated, and using the database id as the field name...i need to mark some of them as required, then test that they're filled out using jquery, whats the best way to do that?
[19:08:09] <bobbobbins> if i knew the field name ahead of time it would be easy, but since i don't...
[19:08:47] <Whirl3d> add the attribute required="required" (HTML5) or add a class called required
[19:09:36] <bobbobbins> Whirl3d: haha, i can't believe i didn't think of that, thanks
[19:10:16] <Whirl3d> np
[19:10:27] <Whirl3d> theBrettman, did you find what you were looking for?
[19:10:54] <bobbobbins> but how do i call the field to even test it if i don't know the field name?
[19:11:13] <Whirl3d> $(".required") will give you all the required fields
[19:11:30] <bobbobbins> ahh, great
[19:13:02] <Whirl3d> var valid=true; $(".required").map(function (e) {var val=$(this).val(); if (val==""||val===undefined||val==$(this).attr("placeholder")) valid=false; return false;});
[19:13:06] <raj> how do I select an element with two specific classes?
[19:13:19] <Whirl3d> $(".class1.class2");
[19:13:27] <raj> thank you
[19:13:44] <Eviltwin> I like $(".foo, .bar").not(".foo.bar")
[19:14:09] <Whirl3d> but that will get all foos and all bars
[19:14:23] <Whirl3d> whereas foo.bar will get only those with both foo and bar
[19:14:51] <Whirl3d> (sry, I missed the "." before not (thought it was plain english not selector))
[19:14:59] <Eviltwin> It won't get all foos and all bars
[19:16:12] <Whirl3d> your selector should get all foos or all bars that don't have both foo and bar, right?
[19:16:28] <Eviltwin> Yup, basically an xor of the two
[19:16:49] <xp_prg> ok lets say I have this:  <li id="librn3"> <div id="bnr3">  how do I get the id name under librn3?
[19:17:04] <Eviltwin> ?.next @ xp_prg ?
[19:17:06] <bot-t> Eviltwin, IRC logs: freenode / #html5 / 20110802 - http://krijnhoetmer.nl/irc-logs/html5/20110802
[19:17:06] <pootietang> has anyone used validate.js? I'm having problems displaying error messages near their respective fields. They all go on top of the page by default.
[19:17:08] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[19:17:09] <Eviltwin> ?.next @ xp_prg
[19:17:10] <bot-t> xp_prg, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[19:17:38] <xp_prg> I know I can do this: $('libnr3).next().attr('id'); ?
[19:18:05] <Whirl3d> wait, sibling means peer, right?
[19:18:15] <pootietang> Here's the link to the form: http://pro-vox.ca/clients/databox/mrcremaillere/site/inscription
[19:19:07] <pootietang> I would appreciate any help I can get. I am also looking for a developer who can help with jqueryui issues.
[19:19:08] <Whirl3d> wouldn't you want $("#librn3").child().attr('id');  to the the id under librn3?
[19:19:08] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: peer?
[19:19:23] <Eviltwin> Sibling means sibling
[19:19:27] <Eviltwin> As in the same immediate parent
[19:19:58] <Whirl3d> I thought they meant under heirarchically.
[19:20:05] <Whirl3d> not listorder under
[19:20:24] <Eviltwin> Y'all are lucky you're doing JavaScript and jQuery
[19:20:27] <Eviltwin> I'm stuck doing OCaml right now
[19:20:42] <Whirl3d> what's that? LOL Never even heard of it.
[19:21:06] <Eviltwin> It's hell
[19:21:10] <Eviltwin> ?w OCaml
[19:21:12] <bot-t> Eviltwin, OCaml - OCaml ( ), originally known as Objective Caml, is the main implementation of the Caml programming language, created by Xavier Leroy, Jérôme Vouillon, Damien Doligez, Didier Rémy and others in 1996. OCaml extends the core Caml language with object-oriented constructs. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCaml
[19:22:06] <xp_prg> oh cool I can do it with position!
[19:22:47] <xp_prg> here is my confusion I have this working $('#slider').easySlider but I don't know how to see what I can get inside of it
[19:22:55] <xp_prg> I see in the code there are options etc...
[19:22:58] <Whirl3d> What on earth are you working on? Or can you tell me without having to kill me after...
[19:23:51] <xp_prg> I am testing things
[19:26:04] <bobbobbins> Whirl3d, hey, if i use that .required...is there a way to do it so it only gives me .requireds that are currently visible? .required:visible?
[19:26:22] <xp_prg> Whirl3d do you know any way for me to know this?
[19:26:34] <xp_prg> I try inspect but that is just huge, can't figure out what I can get in there
[19:26:41] <Whirl3d> bobbobbins, yes
[19:27:09] <raj> is this kosher syntax? $(".autocomplete_list.active").append('<li class="autocomplete-single-result">' + data[item])
[19:27:11] <Whirl3d> xp_prg, what do you mean by "get in there"
[19:27:15] <kawohi_> can anyone tell me why when clicking get more quotes, it doesn't do nothing? suppose to return data from db with ajax http://kdevs.site40.net/
[19:27:37] <xp_prg> get attributes and objects
[19:27:46] <xp_prg> how do I discover what I can get access to?
[19:27:56] <xp_prg> for example .position()
[19:28:02] <xp_prg> it has top and left attributes
[19:28:26] <xp_prg> inspect shows left and top
[19:28:31] <Whirl3d> You are asking me to give you a rundown of every property and every jquery function available for your slider project?
[19:28:42] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: This is what api.jquery.com is for
[19:28:59] <xp_prg> Whirl3d I have a slider object, I want to discover its attributes
[19:29:05] <xp_prg> why is that a hard question to answer?
[19:29:08] <Whirl3d> look at the slider api
[19:29:14] <Whirl3d> it's not.
[19:29:18] <kawohi_> trying to get this to work :/ http://stackoverflow.com/a/8899969/538786
[19:29:19] <Whirl3d> Look at the API
[19:29:53] <Whirl3d> Telll you what, I'll answer you xp_prg if you can tell me how long is a piece of string...
[19:30:26] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: Run this: for(var k in interestingObject) alert(k + " -> " + interestingObject[k]);
[19:30:43] <Eviltwin> Where interestingObject is the thing you want to discover the properties of
[19:31:16] <xp_prg> http://pastebin.com/Zw1Tr4T2
[19:31:19] <xp_prg> this is what I get
[19:31:34] <Whirl3d> but xp_prg, here's the rub: just because it isn't in there now doesn't mean you can't put it in there...whatever it is
[19:31:35] <xp_prg> when I do the simple line on line 1
[19:31:38] <Eviltwin> ?
[19:31:51] <kawohi_> love sucks.
[19:31:56] <xp_prg> can I get defaults?
[19:31:58] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: Dude, I really don't understand what you're asking
[19:32:11] <Eviltwin> No, no you can't
[19:32:21] <kawohi_> depression sucks. love sucks. I hate love.
[19:32:27] <xp_prg> Eviltwin I want to be able to see inside of the slider object and just get different attributes, I just can't figture out what those are
[19:32:39] <Whirl3d> trolling, however, never loses its glamour, huh?
[19:32:57] <xp_prg> I am not a troll, is that what you think?
[19:33:06] <Whirl3d> kawohi was trolling
[19:33:39] <abjorn> o.o
[19:33:43] <kawohi_> i feel like ripping my heart out
[19:33:49] <Whirl3d> xp_prg, the slider object has all of the attributes available in the defaults variable in the code you posted.
[19:33:53] <kawohi_> anyways
[19:33:57] <abjorn> #lovequery
[19:33:58] <kawohi_> can one of you help me?
[19:34:01] <xp_prg> so how do I get one of them?
[19:34:09] <Eviltwin> kawohi_: Sounds like you're asking if one of us can write your site for you
[19:34:11] <abjorn> if your question has to do with jquery, yes
[19:34:16] <kawohi_> no, im not
[19:34:19] <kawohi_> +
[19:34:34] <xp_prg> like speed?
[19:35:00] <xp_prg> would I do something like this $('#slider').easySlider.attr('speed'); ?
[19:35:04] <Eviltwin> kawohi_: How experienced are you with JavaScript and jQuery?
[19:35:10] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: Get one of what?
[19:35:27] <xp_prg> get the attribute speed out of the easySlider object
[19:35:27] <kawohi_> I have this site 85% complete. I'm trying to fetch the next selection of data, which is done thanks to that s.o answer I linked to. but now, I'm @ the ajax/jQuery part and it's doing nothing.
[19:35:33] <Whirl3d> have you tried $("#slider").attr("options")["speed"]?  I dunno...
[19:35:48] <Eviltwin> kawohi_: http://pastebin.com/YQyA5Fzz
[19:35:54] <Eviltwin> I ran your script.js through jsbeautifier
[19:36:05] <kawohi_> I've been learning javascript for a few weeks now. slowly learning it. I'm doing this for a client. I feel like if I force to learn it, I can learn it faster. and I am actually learning faster.
[19:36:05] <Eviltwin> So you can see what the actual indentation levels are
[19:36:08] <xp_prg> Whirl3d that is undefined
[19:36:19] <Whirl3d> sometimes in a plugin properties are exposed and sometimes they are kept private...exposed properties can be read through $("#slider").attr("exposed");
[19:36:31] <Whirl3d> whereas private properties are private for a reason
[19:36:32] <kawohi_> Oh sorry, evil. I can paste in the exac js that  you need
[19:36:32] <abjorn> coldhead: I feel like watching a talk on javascript or something like that, while working, SUGGESTIONS?
[19:36:35] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: That's how you read attributes
[19:36:40] <abjorn> coldhead: I know it's an odd request
[19:36:48] <Eviltwin> kawohi_: Take a look at this: http://pastebin.com/YQyA5Fzz
[19:36:53] <Whirl3d> I always get property and attributes messed up.
[19:37:35] <Eviltwin> kawohi_: Note what is inside of what
[19:37:37] <xp_prg> Whirl3d how do I discover what the non-privates properties are on the slider object?
[19:37:41] <xp_prg> do I check its private parts?
[19:37:55] <Whirl3d> THE API
[19:37:59] <Whirl3d> wow
[19:38:12] <kawohi_> right where it says function getQuotes is the part I need help with
[19:38:15] <xp_prg> Whirl3d python has this thing called dir
[19:38:15] <Eviltwin> kawohi_: You appear to have placed the bulk of your code inside a $.post callback which is inside a submit .delegate
[19:38:26] <xp_prg> you can discover all the available attributes that way
[19:38:27] <Eviltwin> Do you understand why this is probably not what you want
[19:38:31] <kawohi_> http://stackoverflow.com/a/8899969/538786
[19:38:32] <xp_prg> trying to figure that out in javascript jquery land
[19:38:37] <kawohi_> oh no, not that part evil
[19:38:37] <Whirl3d> The instructions for the slider script should tell you what you can and can't read
[19:38:52] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: So what are you trying to access?
[19:39:04] <xp_prg> Whirl3d you can't interrogate an object to see its available/viewable properties?
[19:39:15] <kawohi_> Starting from here   function getQuotes(start, limit) { is where I need help with.
[19:39:17] <xp_prg> an easySlider object
[19:39:25] <Eviltwin> function dir(o) { var ks = []; for(var k in o) ks.push(k); }
[19:39:33] <kawohi_> in my PHP it returns json echo(json_encode($data));
[19:39:34] <Eviltwin> dir(theThing);
[19:39:40] <Eviltwin> Will return an array of all of the properties of the object
[19:40:32] <theBrettman> I don't know what to attach keyup() to delete something in that project I'm working on...
[19:40:48] <xp_prg> gives undefined
[19:40:52] <kawohi_> So I need to clear .recent-list, get the next results that is returned by json and then pop it in the list. which is the part im having trouble with.
[19:40:57] <theBrettman> is there some kind of input object I need?
[19:41:36] <Whirl3d> But then there's the jquery object that you might want the attributes of, rather than the properties of an object.
[19:41:58] <Eviltwin> kawohi_: It actually looks okay as is
[19:42:35] <xp_prg> if I have a div with a style="width:960px;" how do I get the width property if the div name is slider?
[19:42:41] <kawohi_> but it doesn't work...
[19:42:46] <Whirl3d> I think you want the attributes of the slider jquery object (which is a collection of slides with attributes (or properties) that determine how the slides are displayed.
[19:42:50] <xp_prg> I try this but it says undefined: $('#slider').attr('width');
[19:42:51] <Whirl3d> $("#slider").width();
[19:42:53] <someprimetime> $('#slider').width()?
[19:43:15] <Whirl3d> or $("#slider").css("width");
[19:43:41] <oojacoboo> if I'm doing an ajax get and pull that into a function as data, how can I run a get on that data to pull out the contents of a specific DOM element and use .replace() or .html() within the current DOM?
[19:43:42] <Eviltwin> kawohi_: What part doesn't work?
[19:43:48] <Whirl3d> though they are two different things, I am at a loss for how to describe the difference between them. Eviltwin could easily
[19:44:01] <xp_prg> yes Whirl3d that is what I want from the slider object
[19:44:13] <Whirl3d> how much time have you spent with the slider api?
[19:44:20] <xp_prg> but I am having the hardest time figuring out how to find them?
[19:44:27] <Whirl3d> READ THE MF APIK
[19:44:30] <Whirl3d> *API
[19:44:36] <Whirl3d> it'll tell you
[19:44:38] <xp_prg> I have been looking at the options function that is all
[19:44:48] <xp_prg> Whirl3d I don't know how to read the api to discover this :(
[19:45:00] <Whirl3d> ?.slider
[19:45:01] <bot-t> Whirl3d, UI/API/1.8/Slider - The jQuery UI Slider plugin makes selected elements into sliders. There are various options such as multiple handles, and ranges. The handle can be moved with the mouse or the arrow keys. http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider
[19:45:02] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: Can you ask me your precise question?
[19:45:08] <Eviltwin> I've lost it in the noise
[19:45:21] <paupl> Hey lads, looking for the best solution for grabbing the contents of a div from another page. At first i was using load() and dumping the contents straght into another div. But now I need to combine that with similarly retreived contents. My first thought was that I should be getting these divs as variables, and processing them. load() lets me specify a div to grab but I can't put it into a variable, and $.get() lets me put it in a vari
[19:45:37] <xp_prg> how do I get the speed value of an easySlider object?
[19:45:49] <paupl> Shoudl I be dumping the div contents as hidden divs in my dom and manipulate them from there?
[19:45:55] <Whirl3d> xp_prg, click the link bot-t just provided and read every word. Then, if your question is not answered, come back and ask it. Otherwise you are just wasting your time and everyone elses.
[19:46:04] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: Can you relink the source for easySlider?
[19:46:33] <xp_prg> http://pastebin.com/Zw1Tr4T2
[19:46:36] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: Actually, this is probably your answer: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Slider#method-option
[19:47:04] <Eviltwin> If it's the same slider
[19:47:10] <Eviltwin> Which it doesn't look like
[19:47:24] <bobbobbins> if i want to serialize a form, but only do the form fields that are visible, how would i do that? $('#myform:visible').serialize() doesn't seem to work
[19:47:36] <Eviltwin> Okay, bad news, xp_prg
[19:47:38] <Whirl3d> paupl, you can or you can process them in a callback from .ajax
[19:47:46] <Eviltwin> It's not possible
[19:47:55] <Eviltwin> It's locked away in the closure
[19:48:07] <xp_prg> Eviltwin how did you know that?
[19:48:17] <Eviltwin> Because I know JavaScript very well
[19:48:18] <Whirl3d> he's Evil, that's how...
[19:48:28] <xp_prg> I know what a closure is and stuff
[19:48:38] <Eviltwin> What is it
[19:48:38] <Whirl3d> wow
[19:48:57] <xp_prg> just feel like there should be a way to interrogate a javascript object like in python
[19:49:12] <Eviltwin> Yeah, but you can't interrogate a closure
[19:49:13] <xp_prg> a closure is an anonymous function that captures the state of the currenly environment
[19:49:31] <Eviltwin> Mostly because you can't get a handle to the instance
[19:49:45] <xp_prg> you can if you pass a reference into the closure
[19:50:01] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by that?
[19:50:28] <Eviltwin> Wow, who wrote this plugin by the way?
[19:50:32] <xp_prg> if you pass a handle to a function/object that is already in the closure you can use it to scrub inside the closure
[19:50:43] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: Show me what you're talking about
[19:50:55] <xp_prg> I can't it would take too long sorry
[19:51:04] <Whirl3d> lol
[19:51:15] <xp_prg> its the common trick uses to defeat private access in c++/java etc...
[19:51:47] <Eviltwin> Unless a function DEFINED inside the closure gives access to variables in the closure, there's no way to get to them.
[19:52:13] <paupl> Whirl3d: Correct me if I am wrong, but that is similar to get in that I can't specify an element to recieve, but I can get the whole page returned to me as a string? and if so, can that kind of string be manipulated with jquery? e.g. $(varname).children();
[19:52:13] <xp_prg> ok here is my simple goal:  make something work in any way with this syntax: $('slider').easySlider
[19:52:33] <Eviltwin> Did you write this?
[19:52:38] <xp_prg> Eviltwin you can pass a reference to a function and it will then be in the closure
[19:52:42] <xp_prg> no Eviltwin
[19:53:02] <Eviltwin> You cannot change a function's scope and it's scope is set based on where it's defined
[19:53:17] <Eviltwin> The only exception (that's not really an exception) is "this"
[19:53:23] <Eviltwin> Which has a late binding
[19:53:29] <xp_prg> you can't change the functions scope but you can pass a function to a private function and it can see the private variables *sigh*
[19:53:52] <kawohi_> hacking, fraud, invade of privacy, how long would i go to jail for?
[19:54:37] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: The private function can see the variables, the function you pass can't
[19:54:53] <xp_prg> yes it can
[19:55:11] <xp_prg> its going to be inside the private function it can see anything it wants to once its inside
[19:55:12] <Eviltwin> "Pics or it didn't happen"
[19:55:16] <Eviltwin> Show me an example
[19:55:33] <xp_prg> my apolagies don't have the time, maybe later
[19:55:34] <xp_prg> sorry
[19:56:01] <Eviltwin> What you're describing should only take a few minutes to code
[19:56:58] <xp_prg> I don't have it memorized in that way, it would take a while for me to do sorry
[19:57:10] <raj> can someone look at http://68.44.194.145:8080/asdf/edit-profile?section=occupation and tell me why the results aren't showing up as list items?
[19:57:24] <raj> autocomplete.js is the script
[19:57:42] <xp_prg> Eviltwin can I get prevId from the easySlider object?
[19:57:57] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: So you want us to solve your problem which I tell you is impossible but you insist is possible using a technique you refuse to demonstrate
[19:58:15] <raj> http://paste.ofcode.org/v9hFUG28jH59FFZMKd85G5
[19:58:20] <xp_prg> no, you said I could see options that are used to configure the easySlider right?
[19:58:35] <oojacoboo> could someone please tell me what's wrong with this function… http://jsfiddle.net/3SwPN/
[19:58:42] <Eviltwin> I don't recall saying that
[19:59:37] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: I don't understand the goal
[19:59:56] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: I want to pull out an html block from a page and replace a section of the current DOM with it
[20:00:03] <oojacoboo> instead of the entire DOM
[20:00:13] <Eviltwin> How is $.get involved?
[20:00:27] <oojacoboo> it's the ajax to pull in the page
[20:00:33] <Whirl3d> paupl, sorry about that. You can manipulate the html data recieved from ajax using javascript and some jquery
[20:00:53] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: What section of the DOM replaced with what?
[20:01:07] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: same same
[20:01:12] <Eviltwin> ...
[20:01:13] <paupl> Whirl3d: Thats cool mate. Thanks, I appreciate you taking the time.
[20:01:27] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: it's replacing the same as it's pulling in
[20:01:31] <Whirl3d> I don't think all the jquery selectors will work with the returned text until you append it to the dom...but I might be wrong....Eviltwin is the best man to answer you for sure.
[20:01:48] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: You have a selector #wo-settings .wo-statuses
[20:01:50] <xp_prg> EvilTwin so the entire function is a closure so I can't get access to anything :(
[20:01:51] <xp_prg> ok
[20:02:01] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: correct
[20:02:02] <CantUnplug> oojacoboo http://jsfiddle.net/3SwPN/1/
[20:02:08] <Eviltwin> Which can yield any number of elements
[20:02:15] <Eviltwin> xp_prg: Like I said a while ago
[20:02:25] <CantUnplug> http://jsfiddle.net/3SwPN/2/
[20:02:29] <CantUnplug> sorry, typo
[20:02:45] <xp_prg> interesting ok
[20:02:46] <oojacoboo> CantUnplug: nice
[20:02:52] <oojacoboo> that looks awesome, thanks mate
[20:02:53] <raj> anyone gotta minute? could really use help getting to the bottom of this conundrum
[20:03:01] <Eviltwin> CantUnplug: $("foo").find("bar") is actually faster than $("bar", "foo");
[20:03:02] <CantUnplug> test it though, i quicked it
[20:03:07] <oojacoboo> yep
[20:03:35] <CantUnplug> It might be..  i wont argue, i just know that way has worked for me, and cleaner with the scope selection
[20:03:59] <oojacoboo> yea, I like the way that's done
[20:04:31] <CantUnplug> oojacoboo - you may run into issue with older IE's..  sometimes it works cleaner with the .ajax and do the method: get bit..
[20:04:43] <CantUnplug> the callbacks arnt always right, or sometimes cached etc..
[20:04:44] <oojacoboo> CantUnplug: works great, thanks
[20:04:49] <CantUnplug> np
[20:05:03] <oojacoboo> I see
[20:05:30] <oojacoboo> I find this method is much easier than trying to do everything inside of js
[20:05:38] <oojacoboo> I'd prefer to let php do the heavy lifting
[20:06:04] <oojacoboo> granted more server requests, but worth it IMO
[20:06:04] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: What does this do?
[20:06:15] <CantUnplug> honestly, for that stuff, what you are doign is 'ok', but you would be faster to hit a special url, or argument and only return a JSON object of key/vals..
[20:06:20] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: it refreshes a bit of html on the page after a post
[20:06:26] <Eviltwin> What you should be concerned with is the latency of going to the server and coming back
[20:06:30] <CantUnplug> iterate over and update the ids .. instead of running therough the html parser just to chop it up
[20:06:42] <oojacoboo> CantUnplug: yes, I use special pages for most of these
[20:06:59] <oojacoboo> just in some circumstances, where I want to grab a section of a page
[20:07:09] <oojacoboo> in this case, a portion of a form that doesn't need the entire form to update
[20:07:17] <CantUnplug> i do the same too in some apps.. return view partials etc and dump them in
[20:07:21] <oojacoboo> Eviltwin: it's minimal
[20:07:30] <Eviltwin> oojacoboo: It's circumstantial
[20:07:43] <oojacoboo> in our case you can't even tell there was a request it's so fast
[20:08:04] <Eviltwin> But that's no a guarantee that it will always be that fast
[20:08:20] <oojacoboo> yes, but it's not critical anyway
[20:08:23] <oojacoboo> so it's fine
[20:10:51] <xp_prg> Eviltwin if I have $('slider').easySlider is there a way to just tell if easySlider is defined?
[20:11:03] <xp_prg> would I do $('#slider').is('easySlider') ?
[20:13:15] <xp_prg> how do I check if it is a function?
[20:13:45] <Eviltwin> typeof $('slider').easySlider === "function"
[20:13:58] <xp_prg> awsome thanks!
[20:22:48] <Whirl3d> can you have an input element inside an options element in a select element?
[20:23:27] <Eviltwin> No
[20:23:37] <Eviltwin> But it would be nice, wouldn't it?
[20:24:51] <Whirl3d> Dang. I'm trying to figure out how to make a select popup that is editable without having to do the standard "Other, please define" thing
[20:32:47] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/rTC7Z/
[20:34:10] <someprimetime> nice solution haa
[20:34:15] <someprimetime> i like it
[20:34:19] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, you are amazing. I was just wrapping up about 5 pages of code to do what you did in 20 lines. You are my hero!
[20:34:41] <Eviltwin> 15
[20:34:43] <Eviltwin> :P
[20:35:41] <someprimetime> hey Eviltwin i've got a question for ya
[20:35:45] <Eviltwin> Yeah?
[20:35:48] <someprimetime> so this is ALMOST done with my finite scroll
[20:35:55] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/VEkjH/1/
[20:36:00] <someprimetime> go right all the way
[20:36:05] <someprimetime> until you get to stop
[20:36:10] <someprimetime> then go back left all the way
[20:36:11] <Eviltwin> Yup
[20:36:13] <someprimetime> until you get to stop again
[20:36:16] <someprimetime> try to do the same thing
[20:36:24] <someprimetime> for some reason it's giving me a "stop" and i can't repeat it
[20:36:30] <someprimetime> probably because i'm not resetting the clickCount variable
[20:36:41] <someprimetime> so i tried to put it within that function and set it to 0, but it wasn't working
[20:36:54] <someprimetime> any idea on how to get this working? i know it's not the most elegant code in the world
[20:36:59] <someprimetime> but i've been working on it and i'm not giving up.
[20:37:24] <someprimetime> infinitely obviously works flawlessly
[20:38:20] <Eviltwin> someprimetime: Click right, click left, click right
[20:38:33] <someprimetime> oh what the hell
[20:38:39] <someprimetime> :o
[20:38:40] <someprimetime> thanks
[20:39:01] <someprimetime> it's scrolling the amount of the width * clickCount
[20:39:05] <someprimetime> in that case clickCount doesn't get reset
[20:39:10] <someprimetime> so it must be multiplying it by 3
[20:39:11] <someprimetime> hrm
[20:42:21] <Eviltwin> There's a lot going on here and I don't think I have enough time to work through it
[20:43:13] <someprimetime> no worries i understand
[20:43:19] <someprimetime> thanks for checking anyway :)
[20:53:04] <xp_prg> is it possible to count how many things have matched a selector?
[20:53:38] <Eviltwin> $("selector").length
[20:53:45] <xp_prg> ok thanks
[20:56:12] <Whirl3d> Drawing a blank here. What's the selector for an option element with a text vale of "something"? $("option[text='something']");   ?
[20:56:43] <tw2113> attr?
[20:57:12] <Eviltwin> Whirl3d: Not sure there is one. It's kind of a gross thing to select by
[20:57:26] <Eviltwin> Especially since different browsers have different opinions about the text values of things
[20:59:18] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/jaseinatl/rTC7Z/8/
[21:01:13] <Eviltwin> Are you trying to make it so that if they type something that's already a choice, it flips to that?
[21:01:40] <Whirl3d> yes
[21:01:45] * Whirl3d blushing
[21:02:00] <Eviltwin> So if they type "Chicago O'Hare IA"?
[21:02:02] <Whirl3d> Otherwise, you enter a custom value and it adds it to the list
[21:02:28] <Whirl3d> then you'd have two Chicago O'Hare IA options...blech
[21:07:53] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/rTC7Z/12/
[21:09:52] <Whirl3d> Absolute brilliance. Can you explain the map thing. I never quite get that.
[21:10:38] <Eviltwin> Here's an example
[21:10:43] <Eviltwin> ?eval $.map([1,2,3],function(x){return x*x})
[21:10:44] <bot-t> Eviltwin: [1, 4, 9]
[21:11:11] <Eviltwin> Basically a function is applied to each item of the array
[21:11:18] <Whirl3d> so, [null, null, null] = null?
[21:11:36] <Eviltwin> Hmm?
[21:11:39] <Eviltwin> Oh
[21:11:40] <Whirl3d> and [null, something, null]==something?
[21:12:01] <Eviltwin> If you return null from $.map, it doesn't end up in the array
[21:12:07] <Whirl3d> I thought you would get an array, meaning that match would always exist and !match would always fail
[21:12:21] <Whirl3d> Oh! THat's the part I was missing.
[21:12:34] <Whirl3d> Perfect in every way. Thanks so much.
[21:13:54] <Eviltwin> I suggest trying several different browsers to check for quirks
[21:25:04] <Whirl3d> Eviltwin, I have looked and looked and never found a good solution to the custom value issue with Select elements. This is brilliant. Thanks again. I will be sure to give you credit in my script...right after I test in other browsers/platforms. Thanks again.
[21:25:14] <Eviltwin> No problem
[21:31:52] <oojacoboo> what's the best way to flash a color on an element?
[21:32:07] <oojacoboo> I don't really want to add a plugin for this like the color plugin
[21:32:14] <oojacoboo> I was hoping I could write a simple animate
[21:32:22] <oojacoboo> since we already use the jquery ui lib
[21:33:23] <Eviltwin> What do you mean by "flash a color on an element"?
[21:33:42] <oojacoboo> like, add a list item, flash a color to draw the eye to it
[21:33:49] <oojacoboo> 300ms or something
[21:33:58] <oojacoboo> then back to white like it is now
[21:34:22] <oojacoboo> probably needs an opacity change with it too
[21:34:47] <Eviltwin> It's this "flash a color on an element" I'm still not understanding
[21:34:55] <Eviltwin> Flash a color under it? Over it? Change the text color?
[21:34:57] <Eviltwin> What?
[21:35:11] <oojacoboo> background-color
[21:36:58] <oojacoboo> jQuery(element).animate({ backgroundColor: "#FCFCD8" },1).delay(1000).animate({ backgroundColor: "#EFEAEA" }, 1500);
[21:37:01] <oojacoboo> something like that
[21:37:09] <theBrettman> if I want to remove two attributes with removeAttr(), do I have to call it twice or can I remove them both in the same call?
[21:37:13] <oojacoboo> but I didn't know if there was an easier, faster way of doing this
[21:37:40] <oojacoboo> theBrettman: if they have the same selector, only once
[21:37:55] <theBrettman> how do I do that?
[21:38:12] <theBrettman> with array?
[21:38:15] <Cork> theBrettman: if the attribute names differ, yes you do
[21:38:17] <oojacoboo> $('.selector').removeAttr();
[21:38:35] <Cork> if its the same name on multible elements, then you can use one
[21:38:35] <theBrettman> yes, they're different attributes on the same selector
[21:38:36] <oojacoboo> oh, you mean the two attributes
[21:38:46] <theBrettman> yeah
[21:38:49] <oojacoboo> mmm, try an array
[21:38:55] <oojacoboo> I don't know for certain,
[21:38:56] <Cork> won't work
[21:38:58] <oojacoboo> ?tias
[21:39:06] <oojacoboo> ok then ;)
[21:39:09] <theBrettman> thx cork. so I have to chain it?
[21:39:11] <Cork> removeAttr and attr taks a stirng
[21:39:15] <Cork> yes
[21:39:31] <Cork> *takes
[21:40:28] <theBrettman> I prefer removeAttr('class') to removeClass()
[21:40:46] <theBrettman> sometimes...
[21:40:52] <theBrettman> if the class will be empty
[21:41:27] <Cork> so why don't you just use removeClass('') ?
[21:42:14] <Cork> theBrettman: though its actually a bad idea to blanket remove class
[21:42:30] <Cork> another script you write in the future might need to add a class to the element
[21:42:43] <Cork> and then it would conflict with your script
[21:43:12] <Cork> thats why its most of the time better to list all the class names you know you might add, so if anyone adds another one, it will still work
[21:44:45] <Cork> theBrettman: oh, 1.7 added support for multible attributes
[21:45:01] <Cork> its removeAtr('attr1 attr2 attr3')
[21:45:24] <oojacoboo> well well
[21:46:07] <Cork> i'm still on 1.6 loads of problems with 1.7
[21:46:11] <Cork> so... >_>
[21:47:10] <Eviltwin> You'll all be proud to know that Wikipedia is being blacked out with the help of jQuery
[21:47:22] <Cork> ya i saw that :)
[21:47:50] <oojacoboo> whens it happening?
[21:47:55] <Cork> was a bit funny when i got a "oh, wikipedia is blacked out" and i was list... no its not :D
[21:48:00] <Cork> oohnoitz: SOPA
[21:48:14] <Cork> protests agenst
[21:48:50] <oojacoboo> I know the reason
[21:48:54] <oojacoboo> I was saying when ;)
[21:49:00] <Cork> oh
[21:49:04] <Cork> its in effect now
[21:49:10] <oojacoboo> not for me
[21:49:18] <Cork> been for aprox an hour
[21:49:34] <oojacoboo> not here
[21:49:46] <Cork> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page
[21:49:48] <oojacoboo> ah… it is actually
[21:49:50] <oojacoboo> you have to search
[21:49:59] <Cork> not really
[21:50:05] <oojacoboo> http://www.wikipedia.org/
[21:50:07] <oojacoboo> that's not
[21:50:29] <Cork> ya, its only en.wikipedia.org thats affected
[21:51:22] <Eviltwin> And it only asks about your ZIP code if you're from USA, Puerto Rico, Virgin Islands, Northern Mariana Islands, America Samoa, or Guam.
[21:51:39] <Cork> ya, it uses goip for that
[21:51:46] <Cork> *geoip
[21:52:07] <Eviltwin> Or the country search param
[21:52:20] <Eviltwin> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Resig?country=ZZ

[22:56:45] <kawohi> love sucks.
[22:57:20] <Eviltwin> kawohi: Please try to stay on topic here
[22:57:38] <kawohi> okay, anyways. ajax is giving me trouble.
[22:58:41] <kawohi> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8899352/fetching-more-data-from-database/8899969#8899969 can't get the ajax part to work. upon clicking the button, nothing happens.......

[22:59:54] <abjorn> coldhead: lol hours later
[23:00:01] <kawohi> I did before, Eviltwin but I don't see the problem.
[23:00:31] <Eviltwin> Scope
[23:01:43] <kawohi> This is the part not working. http://pastie.org/3205902
[23:01:45] <chrislabeard> what is the best method for doing something when a user starts typing into a field. I tried keyup but it seems like it runs the function every time they type.
[23:02:03] <chrislabeard> http://pastebin.com/GHA5WTuk
[23:02:16] <coldhead> sorry abjsy, i'm terribly oppressed
[23:02:23] <Eviltwin> kawohi: You do understand that it's important where code goes, right?
[23:02:50] <kawohi> You mean.. inside of $(function()? yes.
[23:03:21] <kawohi> I'm learning this, at-least trying to. What am I doing wrong?
[23:03:30] <Whirl3d> chrislabeard, are you looking for .focus ?
[23:03:43] <chrislabeard> Whirl3d: ahh didn't even think about that
[23:03:56] <chrislabeard> Whirl3d: would focus be the same as click in this case?
[23:04:00] <Eviltwin> kawohi: What's the immediate parent of the getQuotes function?
[23:04:12] <Eviltwin> What's the function wrapper immediately around it
[23:05:15] <Whirl3d> $("input").focus(function() {console.log("i'm focused");})  will only run each time the field is focused. Or you could use .one("keypress",function () {console.log("this will only run on the first keypress event");});
[23:05:22] <kawohi> Eviltwin: no idea what you mean..........
[23:05:32] <Eviltwin> *Sigh*
[23:05:34] <thebigkiwi> for jquery, if I was to want to insert a variable into an append function, would i just do "'+variable+'" ?
[23:05:49] <kawohi> Eviltwin: well, I'm learning.
[23:06:00] <coldhead> .append(variable);
[23:06:03] <Eviltwin> ?learn @ kawohi
[23:06:03] <bot-t> kawohi, First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[23:06:25] <thebigkiwi> coldhead: src='//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href='"+href+"'&amp;send=false ?
[23:06:32] <chrislabeard> Whirl3d: k so I have it creating a new field once that field is focused not but how can I move the focus to the newly created field and so on so forth
[23:06:33] <Eviltwin> Right now you have what I consider to be a dangerous amount of knowledge of JavaScript
[23:06:54] <kawohi> Trust me I haveee. I've been reading a book about functions, OOP, and everything. But I am a slow learner. I'm taking on this project cuz I'm learning by force and its working better then reading a book. I know the basics though
[23:06:57] <Eviltwin> Enough to be able to make something happen but not enough to know why something does or doesn't work
[23:07:25] <Eviltwin> Every time you see the keyword "function"
[23:07:47] <Eviltwin> You're creating a new function
[23:07:49] <kawohi> Well there isn't any errors  in console
[23:07:50] <Eviltwin> Which creates a new scope
[23:07:57] <kawohi> ok
[23:08:10] <Eviltwin> If you were to do alert("Foo"); there wouldn't be any errors in the console
[23:08:20] <Eviltwin> But it still wouldn't AJAX load from your server
[23:08:43] <Eviltwin> kawohi: So look here again: http://pastebin.com/YQyA5Fzz
[23:09:02] <Eviltwin> Between lines 8 and 72, everything is indented
[23:09:06] <kawohi> okay, im looking.
[23:09:07] <Eviltwin> Do you know why?
[23:09:30] <kawohi> why?
[23:09:49] <Eviltwin> No idea?
[23:10:24] <kawohi> Well my first thought is its indented because its in a function, just like how you indent html and css.
[23:10:35] <Eviltwin> It is indented because it's in a function
[23:10:36] <Eviltwin> But what function
[23:10:49] <kawohi> .delegate()
[23:11:04] <Eviltwin> And why is there a function there?
[23:11:13] <Eviltwin> What does the .delegate statement do
[23:11:25] <Eviltwin> When does that function get called?
[23:12:11] <kawohi> api.jquery says it attaches a handler, so it attaches a click? handler in it?
[23:12:29] <kawohi> it gets called once you submit something in the form.
[23:12:36] <kawohi> I understand that whole part.
[23:12:37] <Eviltwin> It's called a callback function
[23:12:46] <Eviltwin> You define a function
[23:12:55] <Eviltwin> And it gets called when something happens
[23:12:57] <kawohi> But that part of the code isn't the problem...
[23:13:02] <Eviltwin> ...
[23:13:27] <Eviltwin> So this callback function gets run when?
[23:13:32] <kawohi> ohhhh
[23:13:37] <kawohi> its in that function?
[23:13:46] <Eviltwin> Thank God, finally
[23:13:51] <kawohi> i did not see that :/
[23:13:53] <kawohi> lmao
[23:14:11] <Eviltwin> This is what I've been trying to get you to see for hours
[23:14:17] <coldhead> thebigkiwi: right
[23:14:31] <Eviltwin> So LEARN2CODE, please
[23:14:40] <Ortund> [09:14] <Eviltwin> This is what I've been trying to get you to see for hours     <<< So I guess you're not enjoying yourself there Eviltwin? haha
[23:14:52] <Ortund> first thing I saw when I joined the channel
[23:15:21] <thebigkiwi> coldhead: any reason the url would be getting corrputed like this - " http:="" a3.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net="" hphotos-ak-ash4="" s720x720=""
[23:15:23] <Eviltwin> Ortund: While they don't always appreciate it, I'll frequently force newbies to answer a few questions about their code before I tell them how to fix it
[23:15:23] <coldhead> he loves it, Ortund
[23:15:37] <Eviltwin> In the hopes of helping them figure it out themselves
[23:15:38] <Ortund> haha
[23:15:49] <Eviltwin> Unfortunately, they sometimes take a long-ass time to do so
[23:15:58] <Ortund> if I get confused with my jquery, I just console.log everything :D
[23:16:04] <gernatech> hi peeps
[23:16:13] <gernatech> anyone here tried drupal
[23:16:21] <coldhead> thebigkiwi: you probably don't need the " quotes
[23:16:23] <mindis|wurk> Ortund i'm more retarded, i use alert()
[23:16:23] <Eviltwin> I even beautified his code and sent it back to him
[23:16:28] * Ortund works with wordpress mostly
[23:16:38] <Ortund> lol mindis|wurk do you use IE also?
[23:16:44] <mindis|wurk> nah
[23:16:46] <coldhead> var x = 'http://whatever.com/aids=' + lol + '&whatever';
[23:16:52] <mindis|wurk> in fact i was close to dropping IE support from my app
[23:16:59] <Ortund> sweeeeet
[23:17:05] <Ortund> haven't seen one of those in a while
[23:17:07] <thebigkiwi> coldhead: so just the +var+ not "'+var'"
[23:17:17] <coldhead> right
[23:17:22] <mindis|wurk> i got so annoyed by IE's handling of javascript when it comes to editable content
[23:17:25] <Ortund> well spotted wiki
[23:17:55] <thebigkiwi> thanks, will try that, no idea why the url was getting all spaced
[23:18:05] <mindis|wurk> not that the other browsers deserve much praise in that department. i can't believe each of them vomits out different kind of html
[23:18:14] <Ortund> mindis|wurk you stuck with it longer than I did... having to put margin-top: 20px; to all my columns just for IE is what made me decide to give up on it
[23:18:39] <thebigkiwi> no go, may need 1 set of quotes - iframe src="//www.facebook.com/plugins/like.php?href=+obj.source+
[23:18:46] <mindis|wurk> Ortund well this is only for this app, i think i have to main IE(9) compatibility for the presentation pages themselves
[23:18:51] <mindis|wurk> *maintain
[23:18:59] <kawohi> feel so stupid :/
[23:19:18] <Eviltwin> kawohi: Hopefully you'll look a little more closely next time
[23:19:32] <thebigkiwi> thanks coldhead: it needed the 1 " only
[23:19:34] <kawohi> Eviltwin: where did you make that js look more indented? I may need it
[23:19:44] <Eviltwin> ?g jsbeautifier
[23:19:45] <bot-t> Eviltwin, Online JavaScript beautifier - http://jsbeautifier.org/
[23:19:48] <Eviltwin> That
[23:19:51] <coldhead> thebigkiwi: can you do it like this and avoid the quotey nonsense: $('<a />').attr('href', 'whatever' + whatever + 'whatever').appendTo('#something') ?
[23:20:14] <Ortund> there's actually a tool to ident jquery? I just use Notepad++ and hit Tab a lot
[23:20:19] <mindis|wurk> but it's quite funny how firefox turns bolded content into spans, ie into strong and chrome turns them into b. linechanges firefox turns into br, ie turns them into p and chrome turns them into br AND div
[23:20:25] <coldhead> string processing in JS is a punch in the dong
[23:20:47] <thebigkiwi> coldhead: think its pretty good to go now -- https://gist.github.com/dcb00407f06fca53f2a9
[23:20:56] <kawohi> bookedmark. awesome, thank you.
[23:20:57] <Eviltwin> Ortund: It's for tabbing JavaScript and jQuery is JavaScript
[23:20:58] <coldhead> all the best then :)
[23:21:21] <thebigkiwi> client shall be happy
[23:21:23] <mindis|wurk> i just hope all the tag purging (and eventually restoring) i do won't cause too many performance issues for idiots with outdated hardware
[23:21:42] <kawohi> I was trying to not place it in that function before, but my code was such a mess I didn't see.
[23:21:59] <Ortund> even still Eviltwin, Notepad++ has highlighting for much more than javascript and it still tabs properly too
[23:22:21] <Eviltwin> This also does more than just tabbing
[23:22:27] <coldhead> in my experience clients are only happy when they learn you've been castrated and so can't possibly of robbed their daughter's virtue
[23:22:34] <mindis|wurk> speaking of purging tags, anyone know a clever jquery way to get rid of extra <br> at the end of an element?
[23:22:40] <kawohi> Ortund: have you tried sublime text 2? omg its....amazing.
[23:22:46] <mindis|wurk> assuming n amount of <br>
[23:23:06] <Eviltwin> mindis|wurk: All <br>s at the end?
[23:23:15] <mindis|wurk> yes
[23:24:43] <kawohi> at-least theres an error now. 5script.js:65Uncaught ReferenceError: currentIndex is not defined
[23:24:44] <Eviltwin> mindis|wurk: Not ideal but you could do something like: var br; while((br = $("#container br:last-child")).length) br.remove();
[23:25:24] <Eviltwin> That keeps removing the last one in each container
[23:25:36] <Ortund> kawohi: I assume you have a line that declares currentIndex ?
[23:25:44] <Ortund> var currentIndex = 0;
[23:26:21] <kawohi> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8899352/fetching-more-data-from-database/8899969#8899969
[23:26:27] <kawohi> ill try that
[23:26:57] <Ortund> bare in mind that depending on what currentIndex actually is, you may have to declare it as either 0 or 1
[23:27:16] <Ortund> start at 0
[23:27:17] <kawohi> okay so something did happen.... but error. .GET http://localhost/quotes.php?start=10&limit=10 404 (Not Found)
[23:27:41] <Ortund> does localhost/quotes.php actually exist?
[23:28:12] <kawohi> actually, no
[23:28:17] <kawohi> okay i see..
[23:31:07] <kawohi> okay ill upload this and see if you can figure it out....
[23:31:38] <kawohi> it empties it, i guess thats ,html("") doing its job, but then nothing else loads after..
[23:33:30] <kawohi> think I have an idea on what it could be...
[23:34:28] <mindis|wurk> doh. i just keep removing all the <br> instead of the ones at the end
[23:34:50] <mindis|wurk> maybe i should just remove them with regexp
[23:34:55] <Eviltwin> mindis|wurk: Did you see my suggestion?
[23:35:00] <Ortund> Guessyourtextlookskindalikethisrightnowdoesn'titmindis|wurk?
[23:35:10] <mindis|wurk> Eviltwin yes and i tried refining it but it didn't really work out
[23:35:16] <mindis|wurk> Ortund yep
[23:35:24] <Andres75> good morning everyone
[23:35:24] <Ortund> :D
[23:35:45] <Eviltwin> mindis|wurk: Oh, idea
[23:36:13] <Eviltwin> var br = $("br:last-child"); br.add(br.prevUntil(":not(br)"));
[23:36:15] <Eviltwin> br.remove()
[23:36:24] <Ortund> as a general rule though, when I write my code, I follow every <br /> with \r\n
[23:36:28] <hurdos> Hello
[23:36:43] <Ortund> so... bla<br />
[23:36:46] <Ortund> bla bla
[23:37:23] <mindis|wurk> i would probably do too but this data gets stored as html in an xml
[23:37:30] <Andres75> Can someone take a look at http://www.psfinteractive.it/bigoom/jqt.html and tell me why my plugin only appends to the first ('div')?
[23:37:38] <hurdos> How to set up request headers in $.ajax() ?
[23:37:56] <kawohi> okay so, http://kdevs.site40.net/#more . emptys it out, but thats it... I'm guessing I need to wrap the function in .delegate?
[23:38:37] <hello_> hello
[23:38:42] <hello_> ozzy
[23:39:37] <mindis|wurk> Eviltwin mmm nope that doesn't seem to do anything for the end result
[23:40:11] <Ortund> Andres75 why are you selecting $('div') first and then $('.two') after? Why not just use one convention or the other?
[23:41:31] <Ortund> if there's differences (I see 'multiple' on $('div') and 'normal' on the $('.two') selector), specify with a $('div.two') type selector
[23:41:35] <Ortund> just a thought
[23:42:49] <Eviltwin> mindis|wurk: http://jsfiddle.net/dtMQn/
[23:44:39] <kawohi> can you see if theres any reason why this wouldn't work? http://pastie.org/3206037 it clears the list, like its suppose too but then its suppose to load in more...
[23:44:45] <mindis|wurk> Eviltwin heh, just keeps removing all br for me
[23:46:36] <mindis|wurk> Eviltwin though i think i may be botching it up by changing $("div br:last-child"); to content.find("br:last-child"); since i haven't entirely mastered jquerys selectors
[23:47:00] <kawohi> actually its working... in the HTML its displaying more results... its just not showing up...
[23:47:13] <Eviltwin> mindis|wurk: Pretty sure it's because I tried to slip something past you
[23:47:36] <Ortund> kawohi: http://pastie.org/3206053
[23:48:09] <Ortund> although, now I think of it, that if statement I added wouldn't really make any difference... hmmm
[23:49:13] <Ortund> kawohi, looking deeper, it seems like the $ajax call isn't getting any data to write with
[23:50:18] <mindis|wurk> Eviltwin oh wait, it simply doesn't work when the rest of the content is just text without tags
[23:50:29] <kawohi> Ortund: it does, http://kdevs.site40.net/quotes.php?start=0&limit=10
[23:50:32] <Eviltwin> mindis|wurk: That's what I tried to slip past you
[23:50:34] <mindis|wurk> i'll just switch regexp, probably cheaper to process too
[23:51:30] <mindis|wurk> Eviltwin heh, i assumed it was something else since i don't think i explicitly mentioned i wasn't using other elements
[23:51:44] <Eviltwin> I had a hunch it was this
[23:51:52] <Eviltwin> Anyway, I'm going to sleep
[23:51:55] <Eviltwin> Best of luck
[23:52:02] <nisseni> I have made a small validation for a form, and most values I'm validating with .val() > 2 however, telephone no that starts with 0 - I tried .length() > 2 but it doesn't seem to work... any ideas?
[23:55:25] <kawohi> Ortund: maybe this can help you read http://stackoverflow.com/a/8899969/538786
[23:55:36] <Ortund> kawohi did you get that url from the app or did you manually specify 0 and 10 for the start and limit querystring values?
[23:56:02] <kawohi> I manually put that in the URL to show you that it does get the json...
[23:57:24] <Ortund> okay, but does the app have values for those?
[23:58:53] <kawohi> Ortund: What do you mean?
