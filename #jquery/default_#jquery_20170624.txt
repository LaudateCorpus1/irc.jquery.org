[05:46:11] <momomo> This is the scenario, I have a list of items rendered vertically. When someone clicks on of the items, I want that item to move up to the first position on the list, while all others slide down to make room for it. If the item is in the middle, only the top ones would have to slide down.
[05:46:13] <momomo> Is there anyway this is possible using just css, or would one have to do it someone in javascript?
[05:46:13] <momomo> I was able to pull it off almost in Javascript, however, then the element is animated into the first postion using translate3D, and then subsequently prepended, all the other elements due to their translate3D(0, theirHeight, 0), would suddenly snap because the prepension actually affects their natural position, because translate3D is relative to their position.
[05:46:17] <momomo> Is there possibly a way to translate3D using non relative to self position, but absolute positions, so that when I prepend the other elements, they would just stay in their position, and I can remove the translate3D afterwards and they would stay exactly where they are
[10:34:26] <jak2000> 'hi all
[11:21:36] <jak2000> anyone can recommend me a calc plugin thanks
[18:54:18] <amorris> Why is my animation doing the spin and the flip, but then flipping back? I just want it to do the spin and the flip and keep repeating it every 3 seconds. https://codepen.io/Amorris/pen/YQxRqz
[18:57:25] <amorris> Here is JSFiddle if you prefer that: https://jsfiddle.net/odmLy70x/
[18:58:00] <amorris> sorry the jsfiddle is actually https://jsfiddle.net/odmLy70x/1/
[19:18:14] <nyan> Can anyone tell me this return NaN/doesn't update https://jsfiddle.net/n33p8dya/1/?
[19:23:48] <amorris> What are you asking, nyan?
[19:24:00] <amorris> Do you want it to update the PRICE field?
[19:25:50] <nyan> Yes and vice versa. When you input the amount the price field should be updated. If you input the price the amount should be updated.
[19:28:32] <nyan> I created a php function to get the information from the api. Which works fine if I do var golemPrice = "<?php echo apifunction  ?>". However I want to try to code it in full JS.
