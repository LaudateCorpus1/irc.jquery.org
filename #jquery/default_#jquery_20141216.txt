[00:36:35] <BrazenBraden> was wondering, is it possible to load only specific JS files when viewing one page, and then load seperate js files when viewing a different page.. i.e. not load all files every time for every page... ?
[00:37:47] <Uhkis> just dont include the <script> tags on those pages?
[00:39:10] <BrazenBraden> Uhkis, I'm working on a Rails app and the layout includes a single application.js which intrurn includes all the JS necessary for the entire system.
[00:42:22] <Stummi> BrazenBraden, so its more a question for the Rails guys I think
[00:42:30] <BrazenBraden> okie
[00:43:59] <Uhkis> one does not solve backend problems with frontend tools
[00:49:56] <_rgn> split your js bundle into multiple files
[00:50:22] <_rgn> common.js somepage.js otherpage.js etc
[02:09:36] <Stummi> whats the correct method to call an method on document ready with arguments?
[02:09:45] <Stummi> *function
[02:10:18] <Stummi> $(function() { my_function(foo, bar); })?
[02:10:21] <Cork> call a method on document ready??
[02:10:37] <Cork> what do you mean "on"?
[02:10:44] <Stummi> I mean what $(handler) does
[02:10:57] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[02:11:17] <Stummi> $(handler) calls a function when the DOM is ready, according to jquery docs: http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[02:11:33] <Cork> you mean bind an event handler for ready that calls a named function?
[02:11:57] <Cork> Stummi: i know what $(func) does, but i don't see how it fits in with you're question
[02:12:03] <Stummi> I want to call this function with arguments and I am just asking if $(function() { handler(arg1, arg2) }); is the correct way here or there is somethign better
[02:12:21] <Cork> ah, so you want to pass arguments to the function called from ready?
[02:12:27] <Stummi> exactly
[02:12:35] <Cork> then yes, you need to use an anonymous function
[02:44:41] <stampz> hi
[02:44:52] <stampz> i want to get this json object : [{"ID":1,"FirstName":"Bill","LastName":"Gates","Birthdate":"\/Date(-307677600000)\/","Languages":[],"YearsOfExperience":20}]
[02:45:34] <stampz> http://pastebin.com/EkwuG0kT
[02:45:46] <stampz> i dont get what's wrong
[02:46:34] <Cork> stampz: you need to loop the object too
[02:46:47] <Cork> stampz: its an array with an object in it
[02:47:03] <Cork> result[0]['ID'] for example
[02:47:09] <Uhkis> stampz: you're missing # from the selector on line 9
[02:47:29] <Cork> ah, ya
[02:56:36] <stampz> now this should work but it still doesnt ! :(
[02:56:36] <stampz> http://pastebin.com/1zWkPGjP
[02:57:26] <Cork> stampz: sidenote input is a self closing element, it doesn't have </input>
[02:57:41] <Cork> (not the cause though)
[02:58:20] <Cork> uh wait a min
[02:58:28] <Cork> stampz: you need to use .ready or $(function() {})
[02:58:38] <Cork> or the selector won't find #showList as it doesn't exist yet
[02:58:58] <Cork> ?g api.jquery ready

[03:11:40] <[w_w]> I use .focus() to for an input item loaded via ajax to focus. Clicking or tabing to an input field loads another part of the form and is supposed to focus the first input in it... problem is it only works when clicking the input not when tabbing to it? any ideas?

[03:22:59] <bl4ckdu5t> I have this pen where I'm trying to use a service to display IP in JS http://codepen.io/bl4ckdu5t/pen/yyJBBd
[03:23:14] <bl4ckdu5t> console error reads XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://ifconfig.me/ip. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://s.codepen.io' is therefore not allowed access
[03:23:45] <Cork> bl4ckdu5t: you can't do cross domain requests unless the remote host allows it
[03:24:03] <bl4ckdu5t> i.e ifconfig.me/ip ?
[03:24:09] <Cork> yes
[03:24:23] <bl4ckdu5t> do you know any IP service that will allow this?
[03:24:33] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[03:24:52] <bl4ckdu5t> I'm trying to display IP on a static site
[03:25:03] <Cork> sure, but what ip?
[03:25:10] <bl4ckdu5t> users remote IP
[03:25:20] <Cork> the "public" ip if they are behind a nat?
[03:25:24] <Cork> just just there ip?
[03:26:11] <bl4ckdu5t> what PHP will call $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']
[03:26:12] <bl4ckdu5t> yes
[03:26:44] <Cork> ok

[03:36:36] <paulvd> i know but 680 people?
[03:37:00] <Cork> most ppl is most channels aren't active most of the time

[03:42:01] <cannap>  
[03:42:46] <Cork> ?g api.jqeury removeAttr
[03:42:51] <b-ot> Cork: .removeAttr() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/removeattr/
[03:43:23] <cannap> ah so easy omg thx
[03:45:37] <cannap> another question when i click on <div class="template">some more divs inside</div> how can i get only the some more divs inside?
[03:45:41] <cannap> without the wrapper
[03:46:09] <Cork> you mean the element you actually clicked?
[03:46:20] <cannap> yes i only want append the content inside the div
[03:46:22] <Cork> if yes, event.target
[03:46:44] <Cork> though depending on what you want to do there might be better option
[03:46:50] <Cork> but you need to share more context
[03:47:24] <cannap> http://laravel.io/bin/vBnOq#1
[03:47:32] <cannap> <div data-template="4-8r12" data-action="templateToBuilder" class="template" this is my trigger
[03:47:50] <cannap> but i only want every thing in inside <div data-template="4-8r12" data-action="templateToBuilder" class="template"> THIS IS ONLY THE CONTENT I NEED </div>
[03:48:00] <Cork> no i meant the js, not the html
[03:48:16] <cannap> $(this).clone().appendTo(builderClasses.theGrid).removeAttr('data-action');
[03:48:29] <cannap> this is my current js when i click on a data-action templateToBuilder
[03:48:33] <Cork> the event handler -_-'
[03:49:04] <cannap> bhttp://laravel.io/bin/yGMoy
[03:49:41] <Cork> that isn't binding to <div class="template">
[03:51:41] <cannap> yes its binded to data-action things
[03:51:53] <cannap> but i dont want the clicked  div cloned in the new div
[03:51:58] <cannap> only the things inside
[03:52:12] <Cork> cannap: you need to provide the context
[03:52:30] <Cork> currenty it is an event handler "somewhere" and "some html from somewhere"
[03:52:36] <Cork> and an appendTo from somewhere
[03:52:43] <Cork> there is no context at all

[04:31:26] <Solcero> in firebug i only get the message of bootstrap.js - someone an idea how i can debug this problem.
[04:40:03] <Omar-> Solcero make sure you load jquery-core before any dependency
[04:47:03] <baako> hi guys. I have a this ajax/jquery http://jsfiddle.net/baako/eh02ttag/ and in my php page i want to alert this http://pastebin.com/Z8fDi444
[04:47:20] <baako> to see if the ajax is posting to this page
[04:47:31] <baako> but i am not getting any response back
[04:47:38] <baako> any ideas why please
[04:49:29] <Cork> baako: are you sure the server actually returns the content?
[04:50:05] <baako> Cork: i am not getting the echo back
[04:50:19] <Cork> is the php code executing at all?
[04:50:54] <baako> Cork: if it was i should get hellooo back
[04:51:08] <Cork> baako: break down the problem
[04:51:22] <Cork> don't look through the entire stack and try to figure out where it goes wrong
[04:51:41] <baako> Cork: why do you think its going wrong?
[04:51:44] <Manu___> how to use var today = new Date(); to get month name like December instead of integer value from today.getMonth(), how to format it apart from using static array. Is there any inbuilt functionality
[04:51:47] <Cork> baako: start by asserting the url you expect to be called is called
[04:52:14] <Cork> baako: when you've verified that, verify that the url is actually connected to the php file (a logging call at the top of the file)
[04:52:40] <Cork> baako: after that run a curl to make sure the php stack actually do what you expect
[04:52:45] <Cork> and after that the js stack
[04:53:05] <Cork> baako: also make sure the require_once isn't doing something
[04:53:35] <Cork> Manu___: you have the name in an array and do monthNames[today.getMonth]
[04:53:45] <Cork> *monthNames[today.getMonth()]
[04:54:32] <baako> Cork: the php page is showing helloooo when i run it in this broswer
[04:54:46] <baako> www.localhost/updatemusic.php
[04:55:26] <Cork> baako: try making the path absolute
[04:55:29] <Manu___> ok, so I have to use array. thanks
[04:55:35] <Cork> url:"/updatemusic.php"
[04:56:25] <Cork> baako: and again check each step to see where things goes wrong
[04:59:58] <baako> Cork: i have another ajax http://pastebin.com/E0iQjUWK
[05:00:02] <baako> this works NO issue
[05:02:56] <Cork> baako: so check the browsers developer tools and the servers logs
[05:03:02] <Cork> you should be able to see what happens there
[05:05:36] <baako> Cork: also when i click on the submit buttont he page get reloaded
[05:05:42] <baako> why is that?
[05:06:25] <Cork> you migah
[05:06:29] <Cork> * ah
[05:06:58] <Cork> baako: you have click on a submit button
[05:07:13] <Cork> baako: you should use the submit event on the form element instead
[05:07:36] <Cork> to not break user accessibility and browser features
[05:07:52] <Cork> you should also call preventDefault() on the form
[05:08:10] <baako> Cork: i saw somewhere "you have to return false; in onclick handler to prevent opening the link"
[05:08:19] <baako> i dont get it
[05:08:22] <Cork> no, that is really REALLY wrong
[05:08:47] <Cork> what you want to do is bind the submit event on the form element
[05:09:14] <Cork> and in the submit event: 'submit', function(event) { event.preventDefault(); $.ajax() })
[05:09:27] <Cork> that should solve all your problems
[05:09:28] <Manu___> how to calculate number of days in current month ?
[05:09:49] <Manu___> feb ..
[05:09:50] <Cork> Manu___: this month + 1, day: -1
[05:10:08] <Cork> and date will do the rest :)
[05:10:41] <Manu___> sorry didn't get it
[05:11:30] <baako> Cork: like this http://pastebin.com/0zXgh8QX?
[05:11:34] <baako> http://pastebin.com/0zXgh8QX
[05:11:35] <Cork> Manu___: http://jsfiddle.net/aux6c3xv/
[05:12:13] <Cork> eh...
[05:12:14] <Cork> no
[05:12:22] <Cork> "bind the submit event"
[05:12:28] <Manu___> thanks cork :)
[05:14:50] <baako> Cork: $(".update").bind("click", function () { a.jax()
[05:15:17] <Cork> baako: where do you find "submit" in "click"?
[05:16:05] <baako> Cork: so Cork: $(".update").bind("submit", function () { a.jax()
[05:23:41] <baako> Cork: got it
[05:23:42] <baako> $("form").submit(function (e) {         e.preventDefault()
[05:45:07] <hanmac> hey while using iframe with fancybox, what might be wrong if "parent.$" is undefined?
[05:46:06] <Cork> the parent page is cross origin or don't have jquery as window.$
[05:46:59] <baako> hi guys in ajax you have data:{musicid:musicid},
[05:47:11] <baako> what is the first "musicid" for
[05:47:20] <baako> http://pastebin.com/vQyHr6Ct
[05:47:36] <baako> is that a new name for the varible?
[05:49:56] <Cork> baako: you should prob start by learning the basics
[05:50:14] <Cork> cause you're kinda russing past things right now
[06:00:57] <coachz> hi, what's the easiest way to return my ajax success data to a js var?  line 17 http://laravel.io/bin/l5aoa
[06:01:22] <coachz> i read setting async: false is not recommended
[06:01:56] <Cork> coachz: the best solution is; don't
[06:02:11] <Cork> return the deferred promise $.ajax gives you
[06:02:23] <coachz> i don't know what a deferred promise is
[06:02:33] <Cork> and where you need to handle the data use variable.done(function(data) {})
[06:02:45] <Cork> $.ajax().done(function() {}) <--
[06:03:01] <Cork> .done == success, .fail == error
[06:03:50] <Cork> coachz: returning the value means the code has to run sync, but that means the browser has to freeze the page AND interface while it waits for the server response
[06:04:29] <Cork> only way around that is to restructure the code to work with async callbacks or promises instead
[06:04:41] <Cork> jquery deferred is an implementation of promise
[06:05:07] <coachz> what's the easiest way, deferred ?
[06:05:15] <Cork> yes
[06:05:48] <coachz> can you show me how my code would implement that?  if not i'll go off to reading land and wander around there http://laravel.io/bin/l5aoa
[06:05:56] <Cork> var empData = fnPopulateEmp(emp_id); empData.done(function(data) { /* code for when the data is back */ });
[06:05:58] <coachz> usually for hours :-)
[06:06:16] <Cork> just do return $.ajax() in the function
[06:06:34] <coachz> ok
[06:08:31] <coachz> that works, but you knew that.  thanks very much Sir Cork !
[06:08:58] <hanmac> Cork: it should be the same domain, and the parent window should have jquery as $ ... but i am currently at debuging
[06:32:40] <Eels> Hey there! Could somebody tell me why this only works in one direction? http://pastie.org/private/9tqjd4krmwhyaitdfx44a
[06:33:11] <Eels> I can toggle it on, but not back off
[06:35:55] <Cork> Eels: you can't unload a stylesheat by chaning the attr value
[06:36:06] <Cork> and you REALLY shouldn't even try
[06:36:59] <Cork> Eels: control the styling with a class on body
[06:37:42] <Eels> I've tried with addClass and removeClass but that gave the same result. Lemme try again
[06:41:18] <Eels> Same result stylesheet wise, but I still can't toggle the switch back
[06:41:25] <hlvwrk> >_<
[06:42:06] <Eels> http://pastie.org/private/ptnypzsuagjzdgp9t8hqg
[06:42:42] <Cork> Eels: http://jsfiddle.net/e29e5ns4/
[06:44:55] <Cork> Eels: also event listeners on a selector doesn't work like that
[06:45:16] <Cork> Eels: with that code you query for element with the off.png image and bind to those
[06:45:24] <Cork> and then query for the ones with on and bind to those
[06:45:30] <Cork> they aren't dynamic
[06:46:02] <Cork> so if the value change the selector won't remove the old event listeners and return the selector and bind again
[06:46:10] <Cork> you have to check the value inside the handler
[06:46:25] <Cork> Eels: or better, use a button, set the image in the stylesheet and just have it handle it
[06:47:14] <Eels> Lemme try that. Thanks!
[06:55:34] <munix> would you prefer to use requirejs instead on concate files?

[07:34:29] <morficus> welcome to the future
[07:48:13] <paulvd> is there any callback for jquery ui tabs after the tabs are loaded?
[07:48:39] <CrazyZurfer> Hi.. how can do what i'm trying in this code? http://jsbin.com/hulixumave/2/edit?html,js,console ... as it seems .. the elements are being iterated but jquery functions don't work on them :(
[08:00:38] <paulvd> is there any callback for jquery ui tabs after the tabs are loaded?
[08:02:27] <Omar-> !api tabs
[08:02:27] <b-ot> Omar-: No matches.
[08:02:31] <Omar-> !api tab
[08:02:32] <b-ot> Omar-: No matches.
[08:03:01] <Omar-> http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-create
[08:05:31] <cjohnson> with CrazyZurfer read the docs for .each
[08:05:37] <cjohnson> specifically what the callback receives
[08:09:18] <Omar-> in widget factory, can I let several events perform the same function in one line?
[08:09:28] <CrazyZurfer> cjohnson: what about it?.. I don't find anything there :S
[08:09:40] <paulvd> create or activate ?
[08:09:55] <Omar-> e.g. this._on(element, { "click tap vclick": "_handlerThem" });
[08:09:58] <cjohnson> CrazyZurfer: you didn't find the docs or what?
[08:10:03] <cjohnson> or you just didn't read them
[08:10:49] <CrazyZurfer> cjohnson: I found them.. just don't find the answer I need
[08:10:56] <Omar-> paulvd there is activate and create
[08:11:22] <Omar-> beforeload and load http://api.jqueryui.com/tabs/#event-load
[08:11:34] <paulvd> load is only for ajax isnt it
[08:11:53] <Omar-> I dont know, I'm not into jQ-UI
[08:12:00] <CrazyZurfer> cjohnson: Now I found.. I was looking for the wrong .each function
[08:12:05] <cjohnson> CrazyZurfer: well firstly there's two formats of .each. you're using the one to iterate over arrays, not jquery objects
[08:12:15] <cjohnson> CrazyZurfer: $('tr').each is diff than $.each($('tr')
[08:12:18] <paulvd> then how are you answering all
[08:12:25] <cjohnson> anyway, this refers to the node in question
[08:12:33] <cjohnson> not a jquery wrapped node
[08:12:50] <cjohnson> I think the second argument is the same way
[08:12:53] <cjohnson> so $(value)
[08:13:58] <CrazyZurfer> cjohnson: Awesome.. now everything works
[08:14:14] <CrazyZurfer> cjohnson: Thanks
[08:14:16] <Omar-> paulvd I didn't give a definite answer, I just provided you with a link
[08:14:18] <cjohnson> CrazyZurfer: think of jquery objects as always being a collection of normal nodes. Even a single-element jquery object is still a collection of one node. So inside of callbacks working on collections, it's going to return the elements themselves
[08:14:55] <cjohnson> paulvd: read the docs
[08:14:56] <cjohnson> that he linked you
[08:15:03] <cjohnson> it explains when the events fire, and how to bind to them
[08:15:09] <cjohnson> so it's up to you to decide which applies to your scenario
[08:15:53] <paulvd> cjohnson
[08:15:58] <paulvd> Triggered after a remote tab has been loaded. << read this there
[08:16:06] <paulvd> its only for ajax loading tabs
[08:16:12] <paulvd> i have already read that link before
[08:16:32] <cjohnson> he linked you two things. but more importantly, he linked you to the page where *all* of the events are described
[08:16:35] <cjohnson> don't be lazy.
[08:18:00] <Omar-> paulvd loaded = created = when jQ-UI finishes creating (adding classes) the tabs
[08:18:12] <Omar-> the event is "tabscreate"
[08:19:00] <Omar-> $(".selector").on("tabcreate", whatever); or $(".selector").tabs({ create: function () { console.log("create"); } });
[08:19:04] <Omar-> choose any
[08:19:16] <paulvd> hm ok trying tabscreate now
[08:19:24] <paulvd> create didnt work
[08:19:30] <Omar-> tabscreate
[08:19:45] <Omar-> widget-name + event
[08:19:51] <Omar-> tabs + create
[08:19:57] <Omar-> tabs + beforeload
[08:20:03] <Omar-> tabs + foo
[08:20:05] * cjohnson shakes head
[08:21:11] <Omar-> in widget factory, can I let several events perform the same function in one line?
[08:21:24] <Omar-> e.g. this._on(element, { "click tap vclick": "_handlerThem" });
[08:21:40] <arschmitz> Omar-: No
[08:21:49] <Omar-> the above line doesn't work, I dont want to repeat the function for each one
[08:21:53] <Omar-> hey alex
[08:22:02] <Omar-> thanks arschmitz :)
[08:23:05] <arschmitz> Omar-: there is no way to do that with _on
[08:23:10] <Omar-> arschmitz do you recommend listening to tap as well as click for jQM?
[08:23:44] <Omar-> $(".selector").on(" event1 event2 ") works but why not _on? arent they the same?
[08:23:56] <arschmitz> no they are not the same
[08:24:10] <arschmitz> _on is its own special method with its own api
[08:24:47] <Omar-> arschmitz so within the widget, is it better to use .on instead?
[08:24:53] <Omar-> or in special cases?
[08:25:15] <arschmitz> you should almost never use .on within a widget
[08:25:24] <cjohnson> Omar-: never used it but have you tried
[08:25:37] <cjohnson> {click: '_handlerThem', tap: '_handlerThem',...
[08:25:52] <arschmitz> basicly the one case is where you want multiple widgets to share a single handler
[08:26:00] <arschmitz> cjohnson: thats exactly how it works
[08:27:55] <Omar-> cjohnson yea, but I wanted to avoid repetition
[08:28:02] <Omar-> thanks arschmitz
[08:29:40] <athan> When I have multiple calls to .click on the same element, do they overide each other, or overlap?
[08:31:07] <Omar-> arschmitz i'm working on a widget for jQM so I'm listening to "click", should I listen to "tap" and "vclick" too?
[08:31:33] <Omar-> athan why dont you merge them all in one function?
[08:32:52] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, what's it mean if I call find on an element I already have, like: $(".wrapper-dropdown").find("ul.dropdown > li > a"). Is that finding elements adjacent to .wrapper-dropdown? Or just elements after it
[08:33:31] <bsah_7> http://jsfiddle.net/vho8cov8/
[08:33:40] <bsah_7> whats wrong with slideUp?
[08:33:41] <paulvd> it is finding a inside .wrapper-dropdown
[08:33:48] <bsah_7> why easing: not work?
[08:34:06] <paulvd> bsah_7: you sure you saved it?
[08:34:14] <paulvd> cannot see any html
[08:35:04] <bsah_7> paulvd: is only js
[08:35:22] <Omar-> bsah_7 it's a string, wrap it in quotes "easeInOut"
[08:35:33] <bsah_7> i got Uncaught ReferenceError: easeInOutQuint is not defined  as error
[08:35:45] <bsah_7> ok
[08:35:59] <Omar-> bsah_7 easing: "easeInOutQuint"
[08:37:24] <bsah_7> then i got : Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[08:38:35] <cjohnson> Scriptonaut: under it
[08:38:54] <Scriptonaut> under it?
[08:39:00] <Scriptonaut> the other guy said a child of it
[08:39:31] <athan> Omar-: It's for a user interface that needs to disable and enable buttons from different parts of the application
[08:40:14] <athan> Scriptonaut: It's all under it
[08:40:36] <athan> `.children("selector")` does the first-level underneath, while `.find(..)` does a deep search
[08:40:38] <Scriptonaut> so it will just select anything farther down the source than it?
[08:40:50] <Scriptonaut> allt he way until </body>
[08:41:11] <Omar-> Scriptonaut no, just within .wrapper not outside it
[08:41:27] <Scriptonaut> oh, i see. So it finds all offspring
[08:41:30] <Scriptonaut> not just first gen children
[08:41:47] <Omar-> Scriptonaut it finds child elements
[08:41:47] <athan> does preventDefault() remove previous `.click(..)` bindings?
[08:41:57] <bsah_7> here is the HTML. Mouseover first box (Geld zurück Garantie). http://jsfiddle.net/vho8cov8/1/
[08:42:13] <bsah_7> paulvd: then you see the error in console
[08:42:14] <Omar-> athan it doesnt remove it, but it prevents default behavior
[08:43:34] <cjohnson> Scriptonaut: same difference. it will find all elements inside all .wrapper-dropdowns
[08:43:52] <cjohnson> Scriptonaut: "under" in tree structures implies child. to me anyway
[08:46:23] <Prometheian> If I do $(element).html("htmlStuff") my code correctly alters the html of the element, but if I do a="htmlStuff" and then do .html(a) it does not work. Is there a known issue with using variables when setting html?
[08:46:41] <Prometheian> By "not work" I mean it changes the text but all I get is text, not actual html.
[08:47:21] <Omar-> Prometheian wrapp htmlstuff in $()
[08:47:27] <Omar-> or use .append(a)
[08:47:29] <cjohnson> no that's not right
[08:47:34] <cjohnson> .html(var) should be fine
[08:47:41] <cjohnson> so I suspect there's something else going on Prometheian
[08:47:43] <cjohnson> make a jsfiddle
[08:47:50] <Prometheian> kk, gimme a few ^^
[08:47:51] <bsah_7> any idea?
[08:48:03] <Omar-> a = $("htmlstuff") .... $(".seletor").html(a);
[08:48:11] <cjohnson> that's absolutely not necessary Omar-
[08:49:02] <Omar-> cjohnson yea? html returns string not a jQ object, AFAIK
[08:49:26] <cjohnson> .html(foo) accepts strings
[08:49:33] <cjohnson> .html() returns strings
[08:49:42] <bsah_7> can i set an OR condition in $("#xxxx | #yyyy).  ?
[08:50:10] <cjohnson> bsah_7: #foo, #bar
[08:50:34] <Omar-> bsah_7 || is or
[08:50:52] <Omar-> cjohnson $("#foo, #bar") means both
[08:50:54] <Prometheian> Oh, hmm. The text appears to be being scrubbed by the system.
[08:51:36] <cjohnson> right
[08:51:42] <Prometheian> So instead of < I'm getting &lt.
[08:51:54] <cjohnson> if you ONLY want one or the other, you could .first()
[08:52:14] <cjohnson> Prometheian: are you using .text instead of .html
[08:52:17] <Prometheian> There a way to parse the text so it converts it back on my frontend, or will I manually have to do that?
[08:52:32] <Prometheian> No, but because of site config reasons the text is being pulled from the DB.
[08:52:45] <Prometheian> And that process appears to be scrubbing out things.
[08:53:53] <cjohnson> well go inspect that code and fix it
[08:54:10] <cjohnson> var foo = '<b>foo</b>'; bar.html(foo); definitely works though
[08:54:11] <cjohnson> without a doubt
[08:54:33] <bsah_7> did i use "e" as kind of "this" in wrong way? http://jsfiddle.net/cm4ok2wn/
[08:55:15] <Prometheian> cjohnson: Yeah, I double checked that once I realized that the text was being scrubbed.
[08:55:19] <cjohnson> e is not this bsah_7
[08:55:20] <cjohnson> e is the event
[08:55:22] <cjohnson> this is the element
[08:55:33] <cjohnson> e.target will generally refer to the element as well. but use this
[08:55:41] <Omar-> bsah_7     $(e.target).slideUp("slow");
[08:55:58] <Nancy2012> Is it possible to pass one div id to another div in the same page without loading page..
[08:56:16] <Prometheian> Javascript is frontend, so no. You need to load the page.
[08:56:47] <cjohnson> Nancy2012: "pass one div id to another div" meaning what.
[08:56:57] <pentagrass> ^+1
[08:57:06] <bsah_7> cjohnson:  Omar-:  great, thank you
[08:57:10] <Omar-> same page, yes
[08:57:41] <Omar-> bsah_7 you're welcome
[08:58:05] <Nancy2012> i have a hidden div.. it appears when i click on specific title where i also passing id to this hidden div..
[08:58:34] <cjohnson> Nancy2012: you'll have to provide some code or something becuase what you're saying makes no sense
[08:58:59] <Omar-> on click  var ID = $(this).attr("id") or this.id ... $(hidden div").attr(id, ID);
[09:02:11] <Es0teric> question — can someone help me with this: http://pastie.org/private/mtyurxkkybuo6geyuz3k8w#22-27
[09:02:21] <cjohnson> what about it
[09:03:12] <Es0teric> cjohnson: right now its trying to grab the data-href of a div and exploding it on ?
[09:03:19] <Es0teric> cjohnson: on a click event
[09:03:34] <cjohnson> ok
[09:05:08] <Nancy2012> see this..http://jsfiddle.net/3yjv8t6k/
[09:05:13] <Es0teric> cjohnson: right now i am trying to find a way console log newString
[09:05:15] <Es0teric> but its not working
[09:05:16] <Nancy2012> here i have a title ID
[09:05:24] <cjohnson> console.log(newString) will work just fine
[09:05:42] <Nancy2012> so when i click it visibles hidden div
[09:06:15] <Nancy2012> and there is one field input field.. i want to pass an id there..
[09:06:43] <cjohnson> $('#id').val('theValueYouWantToWrite')
[09:06:45] <robertmaxrees> Nancy2012 btw data attributes start with data-
[09:06:50] <bigwax_> when i type the id of my div in the console it returns the element. is that a jquery thing or chrome or what?
[09:06:51] <robertmaxrees> and they need to have something after that
[09:06:58] <Es0teric> cjohnson: was that for me>
[09:07:04] <cjohnson> nope it was for Nancy2012
[09:07:04] <bigwax_> i can just type myDiv without any js and it will return the elment
[09:07:06] <robertmaxrees> bigwax_ that's an implicit getElementById thing.
[09:07:12] <robertmaxrees> bigwax_ that's with JS.
[09:07:15] <cjohnson> Es0teric all you asked was how to console.log newString. it's console.log(newString)
[09:07:23] <Es0teric> no i am not asking that
[09:07:23] <bigwax_> robertmaxrees, i see
[09:07:26] <cjohnson> now if newString doesn't have what you expect, then you'll have to debug the code that constructs it
[09:07:36] <Es0teric> cjohnson: did you even look a the code?
[09:07:38] <cjohnson> yep
[09:07:39] <Es0teric> because console.log is there
[09:07:42] <bigwax_> robertmaxrees, is it bad to do that?
[09:07:43] <robertmaxrees> bigwax_ browsers like to convert IDs into implicit variables.  don't rely on them because they're not like "normal" variables.
[09:07:59] <cjohnson> Es0teric: right. so see step 2
[09:08:02] <cjohnson> debug the code that constructs it
[09:08:15] <cjohnson> and check that your if statement is evaluating to true
[09:08:16] <robertmaxrees> bigwax_ yes
[09:08:18] <robertmaxrees> bigwax_ http://wtfjs.com/2013/10/02/implicit-getElementById
[09:08:24] <Nancy2012> but how to pass the value inside the input field..
[09:08:43] <Nancy2012> lel me try
[09:08:46] <cjohnson> Nancy2012: .val()
[09:08:56] <robertmaxrees> Nancy2012 .val() is how you handle values.
[09:09:02] <robertmaxrees> and like I said, your data attribute isn't valid.
[09:09:07] <robertmaxrees> it needs to be in the format of data-*
[09:09:12] <robertmaxrees> where * is any string you want.
[09:09:52] <cjohnson> and then use .data to read it. so instead of data="2" you want data-id="2" and read it as such: .data('id')
[09:09:55] <cjohnson> or something like that
[09:10:01] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[09:10:14] <bigwax_> i'm an idiot, i just spent like 20 min trying to debug a simple slideToggle and realized i was selecitng the wrong element
[09:10:20] <robertmaxrees> bigwax_ :)
[09:10:25] <bigwax_> I kept thinking (wow apparently i dont understand jquery as much as i thought)
[09:10:27] <robertmaxrees> it's always something simple.
[09:10:30] <cjohnson> don't worry bigwax_ that's like 50% of the problems in here
[09:10:33] <cjohnson> you're not alone
[09:12:15] <bigwax_> question: say i have an element that when clicked, it fadesin a child of that element. Is it better to create a var for the parent, and then in the on click function use .find to get the child?
[09:12:34] <robertmaxrees> yes
[09:12:39] <bigwax_> ok
[09:12:39] <robertmaxrees> unless you're handling IDs.
[09:12:40] <cjohnson> if you want the click to happen on the parent you'll have to bind to the parent so yep
[09:12:56] <bigwax_> so if it has an id, always use that
[09:13:16] <bigwax_> something like:
[09:13:19] <cjohnson> ID is the fastest lookup
[09:13:30] <robertmaxrees> yes.  $('#someId'); maps to document.getElementById();
[09:13:32] <robertmaxrees> which is fast.
[09:14:46] <bigwax_> var parent = $('#parent');  parent.on('click, function() { $(this).find('.child')[0]; });
[09:14:48] <bigwax_> ?
[09:15:13] <bigwax_> i guess i could use event delegation too
[09:15:18] <bigwax_> if
[09:15:23] <bigwax_> i wanted the click to happen on the child
[09:15:29] <cjohnson> well how would you unhide it
[09:15:37] <cjohnson> once it's hidden you can't click it anymore
[09:15:39] <bigwax_> yeah
[09:15:42] <bigwax_> haha
[09:15:56] <bigwax_> in this example, youre right, just wondering in other cases
[09:16:07] <cjohnson> hard to say without knowing the details
[09:16:13] <cjohnson> event delgation is nice, I try to use it when it applies
[09:16:44] <cjohnson> the code you pasted would be how I approach the situation you described
[09:16:55] <cjohnson> you can do .get(0) instead of [0] if you like also
[09:17:21] <robertmaxrees> bigwax_ why would you do $(this).find('.child')[0]; ?
[09:18:51] <bigwax_> $('#parent .child')[0] ?
[09:18:58] <Es0teric> cjohnson: how would i debug what calls that code?
[09:19:09] <robertmaxrees> bigwax_ why are you accessing [0] on there at all?
[09:19:14] <Es0teric> because i dont understand the disconnect i am having between the ajax call
[09:19:28] <bigwax_> i'm not, it was just for an example
[09:19:30] <bigwax_> ignore it
[09:19:33] <robertmaxrees> hah okay
[09:19:44] <bigwax_> but if you wanted to get the first child
[09:19:46] <bigwax_> of a parent
[09:19:48] <bigwax_> what would you use
[09:19:55] <bigwax_> well
[09:20:01] <bigwax_> the first child of that type
[09:20:02] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't.
[09:20:08] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:20:12] <bigwax_> lol
[09:20:17] <cjohnson> Es0teric: the function you pasted to me. step through it line by line
[09:20:20] <robertmaxrees> i try to write modular code so I don't have cases like that.
[09:20:23] <cjohnson> check the values of each of the variables you're creating
[09:20:29] <Es0teric> cjohnson:
[09:20:37] <Es0teric> i am checking the values but they are not outputting
[09:20:49] <bigwax_> when you create a var for an id, is it just storing the method that gets it, or returning the actually location in the dom so it speeds up the looking next time you use that var
[09:20:52] <cjohnson> then your code isn't being called Es0teric
[09:21:07] <robertmaxrees> bigwax_ with jQuery it's storing the result of the $() constructor.
[09:21:08] <bigwax_> i can elaborate if that makes no sense
[09:21:19] <robertmaxrees> variables don't "re-run" code.
[09:21:28] <robertmaxrees> not in JS at least - they return values.
[09:21:33] <robertmaxrees> functions are how you re-run code.
[09:21:43] <bigwax_> but a function can be a value cant it
[09:21:53] <robertmaxrees> functions return values.
[09:21:56] <robertmaxrees> *can return values
[09:21:57] <cjohnson> Es0teric: if you aren't getting your console.log at all, then it's not being run. if you're getting undefined, the variable you're logged is undefined. open your console and step through your code. if it's not being run, find the code that calls the function you pasted and debug that
[09:22:02] <cjohnson> rinse and repeat
[09:22:10] <Es0teric> cjohnson: i am not geting undefined
[09:22:16] <Es0teric> its a modal that pops up on click of an image
[09:22:23] <Es0teric> and that is not staying popped up
[09:23:08] <cjohnson> not sure Es0teric I'm just going on the code you pasted earlier
[09:23:24] <cjohnson> you said it wasn't calling that console.log. if that's the case, your if check is returning false or the function isn't being called at all
[09:23:27] <bigwax_> robertmaxrees, i guess i was mixing it up with IEFE
[09:23:43] <Es0teric> cjohnson: here is another piece of code that is using that
[09:23:46] <robertmaxrees> bigwax_ IIFEs are functions, too.  the difference is that you don't run them again.
[09:23:51] <Es0teric> cjohnson: http://pastie.org/private/1po9aaamgzowzzkuzynmiw
[09:24:30] <cjohnson> I really have no idea Es0teric because you're sort of rambling. do you have a *specific* line or piece of code that isn't working how you expect?
[09:24:49] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric it sounds like you need to give us a more fleshed out, self contained, functioning example of your code.
[09:25:19] <Es0teric> cjohnson: this is how it works.. this is an “email share” feature right? so when the user clicks an email icon, it pops a modal and that modal is using ajax to send out an email through a php mail function
[09:25:56] <Es0teric> my problem is that the person that previously built this didnt know what he was doing so he put all these data-* attributes in the div that contains the data-* attributes for the email
[09:26:04] <Es0teric> instead of just passing in the post ID from the database
[09:26:45] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric let's take a step back.
[09:27:07] <robertmaxrees> think for a second about the issue - you've got a bug, right?  you're not sure what's broken, and you're dealing with some confusing code.  that's fine.
[09:27:27] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i am going to create a paste with all code related to it
[09:27:52] <srsgores> Guys: I have a form, for which I want to exclude 1 fieldset (I want all the other fields serialized on the form).  I have used a selector like this: j(".form-grid fieldset").not(".tasks-container"), but I need to get all the top-level inputs on the form.  Is there a way to "filter" out just that one fieldset?  I know add() does the opposite, but remove() clearly removes the item, so it's not what I'm looking for...
[09:28:08] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric a functioning example would be helpful :)
[09:28:21] <Es0teric> there is no functioning example
[09:28:27] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[09:28:27] <Es0teric> only the js was built
[09:28:37] <Es0teric> there was no php side to it to send the data
[09:28:42] <Es0teric> so when the click event happens it errors out
[09:28:44] <robertmaxrees> don't care about that part.
[09:28:48] <robertmaxrees> that has nothing to do with anything.
[09:28:48] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/
[09:29:13] <robertmaxrees> srsgores without seeing your markup it's hard to help.
[09:29:25] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: well idk what to say then
[09:29:29] <Es0teric> all i can do is put up the markup
[09:29:30] <oste> is it possible to “reset” an angular directive from within jquery?
[09:29:54] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric what, exactly, is broken in this case?  your ajax stuff?  or something else?
[09:29:57] <robertmaxrees> oste dunno.
[09:30:07] <robertmaxrees> oste does angular give you a way to do it?>
[09:30:07] <oste> for example after pulling in some html with ajax i want to reset the directive
[09:30:56] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: i am going to paste the affected code
[09:30:56] <cjohnson> prob a question for angular people oste
[09:31:01] <cjohnson> or ##javascript at least
[09:31:10] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric that doesn't answer my question.
[09:31:17] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: it will
[09:31:18] <robertmaxrees> is the broken code ajax relateD?
[09:31:22] <Es0teric> because i am going to tell you what is broken
[09:31:26] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[09:31:35] <robertmaxrees> you're doing exactly the opposite of what you need to do to get help.
[09:32:00] <robertmaxrees> you've been banging your head against the wall trying to "describe the problem" and stuff for a while.  pasting up the entirety of your JS file won't help much either.
[09:33:02] <bigwax_> if i bind a click event to a parent element and then click a child, does it still trigger that event since its nested within the parent?
[09:33:09] <robertmaxrees> yes
[09:33:13] <robertmaxrees> because the event bubbles up.
[09:33:15] <bigwax_> thought so
[09:33:17] <bigwax_> yeah
[09:34:13] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/tuuWSHzt
[09:34:26] <robertmaxrees> no.,
[09:34:40] <robertmaxrees> i just explained that this is exactly what i didn't want.
[09:34:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:34:56] <Es0teric> whatever then
[09:35:15] <Es0teric> i’ll figure it out somehow then
[09:35:45] <robertmaxrees> btw why are you doing things like var _this = this; and then setting props on this?
[09:36:06] <robertmaxrees> also, you want to $(this).attr('data-href', newString);
[09:36:25] <robertmaxrees> rather, $(this).data('href', newString); instead of that.
[09:36:26] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees: earlier i had said that i didnt build it
[09:36:42] <robertmaxrees> giving you things to try duder.
[09:36:48] <Es0teric> i am trying to figure something out because the person that built it clearly didnt know what he was doing
[09:36:57] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:36:59] <Es0teric> plus he didnt leave documentation
[09:37:06] <robertmaxrees> that's not uncommon.
[09:43:34] <Es0teric> for some reason when i try to change the ajax url it breaks the modal
[09:43:42] <Es0teric> for a url that exists
[09:51:36] <mrbubbles> if var a = ‘test’; b = ‘test ‘ + a; then b = ‘test test’; but if a function changes, a, b will stay the same yeh? is there anyway to have it change too?
[09:52:20] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:52:26] <duch_kazatel> because you're evaluating an expression.
[09:52:40] <duch_kazatel> unless you "re-set" b when you also update a.
[09:54:18] <mrbubbles> okay thanks duch_kazatel
[09:55:20] <cjohnson> mrbubbles: you could use functions instead of simple variables. b = return 'test' + a
[09:55:24] <cjohnson> or getter/setter
[09:55:29] <duch_kazatel> ^ this, too.
[10:05:30] <Es0teric> alright so i found the problem..
[10:05:36] <Es0teric> single quotes
[10:07:11] <robertmaxrees> in your JSON?
[10:13:35] <mrbubbles> I’m trying to write object oriented jquery. I’ve defined an object like this http://pastie.org/9784594 and when I call chart = new parametersChart that works fine. but when I try adn call one of the methods on it (eg. chart.setRange) it says that “undefined is not a function”?
[10:13:44] <robertmaxrees> wat
[10:13:50] <robertmaxrees> "object oriented jquery"?
[10:13:58] <mrbubbles> well
[10:14:06] <mrbubbles> define an object with it’s own methods
[10:14:13] <robertmaxrees> first off, you've defined a function there.
[10:14:47] <mrbubbles> basically I was following this: https://www.scorchsoft.com/blog/how-to-write-object-oriented-javascript/
[10:14:49] <robertmaxrees> secondly - read up on how to write constructors.
[10:14:59] <robertmaxrees> third - OO JS isn't all it's cracked up to be :)
[10:15:47] <mrbubbles> No but in this case I think it may save my sanity :0
[10:16:15] <robertmaxrees> i'd disagree, but the real issue is that you're returnving this.construct();
[10:16:27] <robertmaxrees> which has nothing to do with your setRange();
[10:17:07] <mrbubbles> ah it may be because I’m using coffeescript
[10:17:13] <robertmaxrees> D:
[10:17:14] <mrbubbles> I may have got the syntax wrong
[10:17:40] <robertmaxrees> why not just do some simple functional code instead?
[10:19:15] <mrbubbles> okay so what you’re saying is that I need to return the object (this) rather than the constrcut
[10:19:17] <mrbubbles> that makes sense
[10:19:33] <robertmaxrees> what i'm saying is don't do psuedoclassical code in js ;)
[10:20:03] <mrbubbles> Okay so the reason I’m approaching it like this
[10:21:12] <mrbubbles> is because I have a graph being displayed. it has a data series being shown on it. under the graph, i want to be able to add further series. that means adding a data set (grabbed via ajax) and a colour to the graph object, and rdrawing the graph. I liked the idea of having an object which held the array of what is being displayed, then adding and removing the data and colours using functions on this object
[10:21:23] <mrbubbles> Just seemed a bit tidier than doing it all in teh ready function and less overkill than adding backbone or something
[10:21:37] <robertmaxrees> why does that require a constructor at all?
[10:21:56] <robertmaxrees> are you going to have more than one graph on the page at a time?
[10:22:02] <mrbubbles> the constructor? oh no I don’t think so
[10:22:13] <robertmaxrees> then there's no need to use one.
[10:22:21] <mrbubbles> ah okay. I think it just said in that articl that it was ‘best practice"
[10:22:25] <robertmaxrees> you can use a simple object instead.
[10:22:44] <robertmaxrees> "best practice" according to whom? :)
[10:23:12] <robertmaxrees> unless you need to create multiple instances, skip the constructor.
[10:23:19] <robertmaxrees> create a simple object and use that instead.
[10:24:53] <mrbubbles> cooolio wil do, thanks :)
[10:38:37] <dunpeal> Hi. I have a faux-form: it's just a button, and if the user clicks it, I want the browser to make a POST request to a particular URL. How should I do that?
[10:39:55] <dunpeal> This should emulate a normal POST form submission, i.e. not XHR / AJAX.
[10:42:50] <NoiseEee> dunpeal: but that's not a faux-form thats a real form
[10:43:10] <NoiseEee> dunpeal: otherwise what info do you think will be sent?
[10:44:14] <dunpeal> NoiseEee: I'll clarify: it's a table where each row represents an entity. there's a bunch of <input type="text"> fields in each row. The last column is a button.
[10:44:37] <dunpeal> When the user fills in some of the input fields, and clicks the button, I want a form to be submitted to the remote.
[10:45:02] <dunpeal> As a POST request, with only the input in that particular row as a set of form fields.
[10:45:13] <NoiseEee> so wrap the <table> in <form>, and every button at the end of each row will be a button type='submit'
[10:45:25] <NoiseEee> but what you want there ^^ is impossible unless you POST via XHR
[10:45:26] <dunpeal> NoiseEee: I called it "faux" because I know HTML doesn't allow forms inside tables
[10:45:49] <NoiseEee> dunpeal: otherwise, who cares about the empty information being sent
[10:46:03] <NoiseEee> you'll only be doing action where the form fields aren't empty, presumably
[10:46:05] <dunpeal> NoiseEee: there's a way to do it, but it's ugly: I can have the click handler of the button create a virtual form
[10:46:08] <dunpeal> and submit it
[10:46:21] <robertmaxrees> dunpeal you have to have a form if you're posting data without ajax.
[10:46:27] <robertmaxrees> afaik there's no other way.
[10:46:38] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: yes, that matches my Google results
[10:46:50] <NoiseEee> dunpeal: then the ugly way is the way to do it if that's exactly what you want
[10:47:15] <dunpeal> NoiseEee: I care about irrlevant fields, because they're all the same, and it's will be hard to tell which ones belong to the row the user "submitted"
[10:48:46] <robertmaxrees> why can't you use ajax btw?
[10:48:48] <dunpeal> i.e. for a 100 row table the server will get 100 "name" fields.
[10:50:30] <NoiseEee> dunpeal: those "names" should reflect the row they are on
[10:50:51] <dunpeal> NoiseEee: yeah, it will be ugly like name_1, name_2
[10:51:03] <athan> is there a `.allowDefault()`?
[10:51:18] <robertmaxrees> athan nope.  there's only "not preventing default"
[10:51:30] <NoiseEee> dunpeal: most backend would throw them all in the same array if you name them: <input name='name[someRowReference]'>  <input name='name[someOtherRowReference]'>
[10:51:31] <athan> poo, thanks robertmaxrees :)
[10:53:01] <dunpeal> NoiseEee: *nod*, I'll check if my backend supports this. thanks!
[10:53:05] <dunpeal> and thanks robertmaxrees too
[10:53:56] <NoiseEee> np good luck dunpeal
[10:54:17] <kal_crunchbang> Hi their, in jQuery i am trying to change the image every 2.5 seconds but it does nothing --> http://pastebin.com/n5AUHW6D
[10:54:58] <robertmaxrees> kal_crunchbang what happens instead?
[10:55:13] <robertmaxrees> also: $("gallery").prop("src", pic[i]); is wrong ;)
[10:55:32] <kal_crunchbang> robertmaxrees:thats what i was told on here yesterday
[10:55:37] <robertmaxrees> $("#gallery").prop("src", pic[i]);
[10:55:40] <robertmaxrees> your selector is wrong.
[10:55:51] <kal_crunchbang> oh yeah
[10:56:01] <kal_crunchbang> obvious mistake
[10:56:47] <kal_crunchbang> thank you
[11:03:30] <ckoch786> I am trying to use the readmore library https://github.com/jedfoster/Readmore.js
[11:04:21] <ckoch786> when I run this in the console of chrome it works, but if it runs from my included script it does not work. $('div.summary').readmore();
[11:04:40] <robertmaxrees> is your code in a document ready?
[11:04:58] <ckoch786> robertmaxrees, yes, I was just about to add that
[11:05:15] <robertmaxrees> is the .summary element getting added via ajax or anything like that?
[11:05:28] <ckoch786> no it is just a div class
[11:05:42] <robertmaxrees> is your page valid?
[11:06:24] <robertmaxrees> one quick way to test is by using a $(window).load(function() { /* your code here */ });
[11:06:28] <robertmaxrees> instead of your document ready
[11:08:30] <ckoch786> robertmaxrees, I wrapped it in the $(window).lo.. as you said and I did not get any errors, but it still does not work
[11:08:44] <ckoch786> here is the site http://pastebin.com/rVSsxnh0
[11:08:47] <ckoch786> code
[11:08:55] <robertmaxrees> no doctype?
[11:09:28] <ckoch786> heres the js http://pastebin.com/QM2aR2VX
[11:09:31] <robertmaxrees> setup a fiddle and try it there.
[11:09:41] <ckoch786> I thought you only need <html> for html 5
[11:09:49] <robertmaxrees> you still need a doctype.
[11:09:52] <robertmaxrees> <!doctype html>
[11:09:58] <robertmaxrees> always always always
[11:10:01] <ckoch786> I do not know how to get the fiddle to work with external js libs
[11:10:33] <robertmaxrees> using the "external resources" on the left-hand side.
[11:11:19] <ckoch786> I tried but nothing happens when I select the + button
[11:11:31] <robertmaxrees> right - you paste in a link and then hit +
[11:11:33] <robertmaxrees> then "run"
[11:13:03] <ckoch786> thanks I got the fiddle up http://jsfiddle.net/ovu2ahtc/
[11:14:13] <robertmaxrees> fiddle only needs the html in your <body> btw
[11:14:32] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ovu2ahtc/1/ like this.
[11:14:33] <ckoch786> I was just removing the extra tags
[11:14:53] <mrbubbles> robertmaxrees: if I have a parent function with child functions inside, can these children functions call each other? I assumed they would but I don’t seem to be able to
[11:14:58] <robertmaxrees> that's not how you load external scripts from githubn.
[11:15:07] <mrbubbles> the children function are in the form this.functionname() {}
[11:15:33] <mrbubbles> OH it’s because I’m calling it form within an ajax success method. damn
[11:15:43] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:17:09] <robertmaxrees> ckoch786 something in your css is broken.
[11:17:15] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ovu2ahtc/3/
[11:18:47] <ckoch786> does it work for you in that fiddle?
[11:18:56] <ckoch786> it does not work for me
[11:18:59] <robertmaxrees> in the most recent one i pasted?  yes.
[11:19:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ovu2ahtc/3/ this one functions.  not perfectly.
[11:20:17] <robertmaxrees> mrbubbles what's going on?
[11:23:00] <ckoch786> thanks I'll brb my gnome is crashing :)
[11:23:34] <mrbubbles> robertmaxrees: I think it’s scoping. i have 2 child functions in my parent function. one can call the other, but if I call it form an ajax success function then it can’t find it
[11:23:49] <robertmaxrees> prolly scoping yeah.
[11:23:59] <robertmaxrees> you have a closure
[11:29:03] <mrbubbles> robertmaxrees: basically this is where I’m up to http://pastie.org/9784730
[11:29:12] <robertmaxrees> tl;dr
[11:29:38] <mrbubbles> oh I wonder if it’s ordering
[11:29:52] <robertmaxrees> what line is erroring?
[11:30:24] <mrbubbles>         this.redrawChart();
[11:30:29] <mrbubbles> " Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function"
[11:30:55] <robertmaxrees> it's because your this isn't what you think it is.
[11:30:59] <mrbubbles> line 33 (ignore the return ive fixed that now
[11:31:20] <robertmaxrees> errr, why are you doing it this why?
[11:31:28] <robertmaxrees> why not just create functions and call them?
[11:31:33] <robertmaxrees> insatead of methods like you've got?
[11:31:34] <mrbubbles> oh, I’ve got you
[11:31:45] <mrbubbles> so I should use my root variable instead
[11:32:01] <robertmaxrees> don't use any variable.
[11:32:06] <robertmaxrees> just create functions and call them.
[11:32:31] <mrbubbles> coffeescript likes it that way
[11:32:45] <robertmaxrees> why even use coffeescript? :(
[11:33:01] <mrbubbles> because I like torturing myself ;)
[11:43:27] <aditya-kapoor> i have a question on .text() and .html()
[11:43:32] <aditya-kapoor> can anyone assist me>
[11:43:59] <Prometheian> What's up aditya?
[11:44:10] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ aditya-kapoor
[11:44:10] <b-ot> aditya-kapoor: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:45:32] <robertmaxrees> aditya-kapoor - the instructions clearly state to not PM people ;)
[11:45:46] <aditya-kapoor> i am sorry
[11:54:07] <mrbubbles> I’m tryign to merge arrays in such a way: array1 = [[1, 10],[3, 15],[5, 20]], array2 = [[2, 25],[5, 30],[8, 40]] and I want combined = [1, 10, null], [2, null, 25], [3, 15, null], [5, 20, 30], [8, null, 40]. Is there an easy way do to this or will I just need to iterate through? I was thinking maybe map...
[11:55:11] <BillCriswell> mrbubbles: Having array1 and array2 named variables kind of ties your hands.
[11:55:25] <karbassi> mrbubbles: iterating is pretty easy way anyways. go with that. :)
[11:55:43] <mrbubbles> BillCriswell: that was just for demo purposes ;)
[11:56:02] <BillCriswell> mrbubbles: Yeah but, I mean just them being separated like that ties your hands.
[11:56:25] <mrbubbles> ah. yeh a bt annoying but it’s from an api so not much I can do
[11:57:21] <BillCriswell> So why not do like... var collection = []; api.call(function(output) { collection.push(output); }); api.call(function(output) { collection.push(output); });
[11:58:02] <mrbubbles> errrr
[11:58:22] <mrbubbles> one sec and i’ll try it :)
[12:00:27] <alexclark> do actions propagate down before bubbling up in firefox?
[12:00:35] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:00:37] <robertmaxrees> yes
[12:00:46] <robertmaxrees> capture phase and then bubbling phase.
[12:00:46] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Really?
[12:01:01] <robertmaxrees> Old IE are the only browsers that differs IIRC
[12:01:15] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: is there a way to stop bubbling but allow capture?
[12:01:28] <robertmaxrees> stopPropagation();
[12:01:42] <BillCriswell> I think I misunderstood "propagate down"
[12:01:55] <alexclark> robertmaxrees: ahhhh awesome!  thank you
[12:02:19] <robertmaxrees> http://www.quirksmode.org/js/introevents.html for more info
[12:03:28] <BillCriswell> Hmm
[12:03:36] <robertmaxrees> capture phase and bubbling phase
[12:03:53] <alexclark> so return false is really dangerous then huh?
[12:03:58] <robertmaxrees> it's a bad idea.
[12:04:03] <robertmaxrees> because it's not what you want to do.
[12:04:45] <alexclark> wow, awesome lesson for today
[12:06:15] <BillCriswell> so jQuery explicitly only bubbles up?
[12:06:16] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of like iterators vs forEach()
[12:08:44] <BillCriswell> Hmmm
[12:09:10] <alexclark> whats the difference there?
[12:10:05] <robertmaxrees> for (Var i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {} vs myArray.forEach(function() {});
[12:10:20] <robertmaxrees> in one case, i'm going through each element in an array and acting upon it.
[12:10:44] <robertmaxrees> in another case, I'm creating a new variable so I can count, and for each number I count, access and array index and act upon it.
[12:10:58] <alexclark> oh ok
[12:11:32] <robertmaxrees> if I want to do something for every object in an array, why am I counting? :) use .forEach() if you can instead.
[12:16:28] <dunpeal> Relative to a given element, how do I get the previous element matching a selector?
[12:16:43] <dunpeal> it doesn't necessarily have to be a sibling, so .prev() doesn't work.
[12:17:03] <dunpeal> for instance, it could be a child of a sibling of the parent.
[12:17:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:17:59] <lpommers> well just using the nattive webApi of querySelectorAll will give you all matches for a selector
[12:18:05] <robertmaxrees> that's ephemeral, dunpeal
[12:18:13] <robertmaxrees> how are defining "the previous element"?
[12:18:39] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: any element coming before it that matches the selector.
[12:19:15] <robertmaxrees> dunpeal how are you accessing the elements?
[12:19:23] <robertmaxrees> ie - why is index relevant at all?
[12:19:39] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: because it's a <td> on a <tr>
[12:19:53] <dunpeal> and I need a previous <td>, not just any.
[12:20:04] <robertmaxrees> so what does the code look like?
[12:20:11] <robertmaxrees> are you doing an .each() or something?
[12:20:35] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: this is an onclick on a <button>
[12:20:42] <robertmaxrees> can you fiddle your code?
[12:20:48] <robertmaxrees> because you're not answering my question
[12:20:52] <dunpeal> nvm
[12:21:11] <robertmaxrees> if you want to get the previous one, you'll have to do some DOM traversal.
[12:21:39] <robertmaxrees> a simple example would really be helpful though.
[12:22:21] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: <tr><td><input name="foo"></td><td><button onclick=baz()>bar</button></td></tr>
[12:22:46] <robertmaxrees> that's your first problem.
[12:22:50] <robertmaxrees> inline javascript
[12:22:53] <dunpeal> in button's onclick (baz) I need to get the contents of the previous input field, "foo" in this case.
[12:24:02] <dunpeal> I don't see how it is wrong to assign an onlick event this way.
[12:24:25] <robertmaxrees> what happens when you need a bunch of them?
[12:24:28] <robertmaxrees> lots of writing them out.
[12:24:41] <robertmaxrees> you can instead have one listener to handle all of them.  a lot clearner.
[12:24:43] <robertmaxrees> *cleaner
[12:24:53] <dunpeal> it's generated by the serverside. but either way, that's not really the problem here.
[12:24:59] <robertmaxrees> that's apart of it.
[12:25:26] <dunpeal> I don't see how it is.
[12:25:37] <dunpeal> baz() gets called, and I get the button.
[12:25:40] <robertmaxrees> makes development a lot harder.  but whatever.
[12:25:41] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[12:25:47] <dunpeal> the problem is getting input foo
[12:26:03] <robertmaxrees> right - anything that makes that easier is a Good Idea™
[12:26:08] <robertmaxrees> let me show you the easy way.
[12:26:41] <dunpeal> I know about $('button').click(baz)
[12:27:57] <hydalgo> hi, page changes not working with jqm 1.4.5  and  cordova 4.1.2. tried most of stackoverflow suggestions. invoking like this: $(":mobile-pagecontainer").pagecontainer("change", "#page_books");
[12:28:08] <robertmaxrees> dunpeal http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/2vdk6e7s/1/
[12:29:09] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: thanks, but since .closest() is symmetrical, how can I be sure it will grab the previous, instead of the next one?
[12:29:23] <robertmaxrees> "symmetrical"?
[12:29:34] <robertmaxrees> in this case, you want to go up to a shared parent, and then find the relevant element.
[12:29:39] <dunpeal> robertmaxrees: i.e. I thought it was looking forward, not just back.
[12:29:55] <robertmaxrees> .closest() is like .parents() but it stops when it finds its first match.
[12:30:11] <robertmaxrees> it's not 'forward' or 'backward' - it traverses up the tree.
[12:30:19] <dunpeal> I see, thanks!
[12:35:52] <spudzee> I've finally converted to mac. I must admit, programming on a macbook is a lot better than I thought it would be.
[12:38:59] <robertmaxrees> spudzee grats.
[12:40:21] <spudzee> So, when it comes to text editors, Xcode?
[12:40:33] <robertmaxrees> i hear a lot of people like submlime text for mac
[12:41:12] <spudzee> I used sublime for my PC, but you apparently you have to buy a license if you're going to use it on a mac
[12:41:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[12:41:27] <robertmaxrees> same thing on both.
[12:42:30] <lpommers> they just give you a popup every 10 saves or something asking you to buy a license
[12:42:30] <spudzee> well.... I started using TextMate, and it's grown on me. But once Xcode is installed I'll probably switch to that.
[12:42:39] <robertmaxrees> 50 saves
[12:42:45] <robertmaxrees> same for windows and mac.
[12:42:46] <lpommers> I've been using WebStorms lately and enjoying it
[12:43:11] <spudzee> I save, like, every 5 seconds of coding. So the popups were definitely noticeable
[12:43:40] <spudzee> Isn't Xcode better for heavier languages like C++ and Java?
[12:43:42] <robertmaxrees> work bought me my copy.
[12:43:49] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably buy it for myself if they hadn't.
[12:44:13] <spudzee> I thought Xcode had a built in compiler for C++
[12:44:18] <spudzee> does it?
[12:44:24] <lpommers> IntelliJ IDEA (community edition) is popular for java
[12:44:50] <robertmaxrees> xcode is more of a fully featured IDE iirc
[12:44:56] <spudzee> Xcode is what #c++ recommended so I'll just use that...
[12:45:35] <spudzee> as long as it's not as crappy as visual basic I'll be happy :)
[12:45:35] <robertmaxrees> it's all about whatever tool works best for you.
[12:45:55] <robertmaxrees> i love my sublime text + FF dev edition setup.  other people prefer chrome with some other editor.
[12:46:39] <spudzee> I must admit, coming from a windows background, the mac OS is SO confusing...
[12:47:08] <lpommers> what bugs me about FF is that you can't search in your network for a specific request
[12:47:13] <lpommers> there are only the preset filters
[12:47:34] <robertmaxrees> lpommers meh, not usually that big of a pain tbh
[12:47:44] <spudzee> I like being able to assign colors to my docs; that is definitely a plus
[12:48:00] <lpommers> i use that all the time at work, it's a pain when you're searching through a bunch
[12:48:23] <robertmaxrees> lpommers i'm in the debugger so much more frequently that it's not really a problem for me.
[12:48:35] <spudzee> this is also the first time I've ever had a bluetooth mouse
[12:48:47] <spudzee> and a mouse with no buttons
[12:48:55] <spudzee> -magic mouse
[12:49:24] <lpommers> i got a magic mouse at work, and then swapped it out, I couldn't get used to it. not my thing
[12:50:25] <robertmaxrees> i like my logitech performance mx.  still kind of miss my revolution though.
[12:55:42] <lpommers> For those here on OSX, what are people using for Git around here? I've found myself using SourceTree lately...
[12:55:59] <robertmaxrees> you might have more luck somewhere else btw lpommers
[12:57:31] <megaTherion> Hi, Im not able to find the correct way to implement progress bar's with XHR2 ajax upload (via POST)...
[12:57:46] <cjohnson> I use git lpommers
[12:58:01] <megaTherion> I've googled a lot already, there are a lot of concurrent methods to implement this, however I tried to override xhr in $.ajax but then nothing happens anymore
[12:59:01] <cjohnson> http://mobiarch.wordpress.com/2012/08/21/html5-file-upload-with-progress-bar-using-jquery/ this looks useful megaTherion
[12:59:43] <cjohnson> the addEventListener('progress' bit is relevant
[12:59:47] <kevin> ^ yeah that's how you do it
[13:01:37] <megaTherion> cjohnson: I tried addEventListener, I also tried .onprogress - this seems essentially equal
[13:02:20] <megaTherion> cjohnson: important to know is, I do not upload a blob, I upload a FormData obj - but it should work anyways I think
[13:05:12] <cjohnson> yeah this example uses post as well. doesn't matter about the upload bits, you can ignore that
[13:05:34] <cjohnson> the important part is binding to the progress event. are you having issues with some specific code?
[13:05:50] <megaTherion> ah I think its working now, I've forgotten to actually return the xhr obj inside xhr: override
[13:07:29] <cjohnson> ;)
[13:08:31] <megaTherion> cjohnson: btw. just because Im here now, Im not really good with JS - however what was the rule, its not possible to upload binary via HTTP POST right? - Im using base64 encoded now, because I need along this, also formdata (not just a single blob)
[13:08:57] <cjohnson> not sure really, I rarely implement uploads myself
[13:09:02] <cjohnson> I let libs do the work
[13:09:04] <megaTherion> ah ok
[13:09:21] <megaTherion> libs are often far too buggy for my purposes :)
[13:09:29] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[13:10:10] <Robdgreat> love me some NIH
[13:11:23] <cjohnson> megaTherion: it makes no sense to generalize all libs as one thing
[13:11:43] <robertmaxrees> megaTherion https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Sending_and_Receiving_Binary_Data
[13:11:49] <robertmaxrees> plenty of great info here for you.
[13:11:52] <megaTherion> cjohnson: statistics, but I've my experience :)
[13:12:00] <cjohnson> some libs are finnicky, some are far more bullet proof than whatever solution you put together through years of testing and use. you have to look into each one individually
[13:12:01] <megaTherion> robertmaxrees: cool thanks
[13:12:19] <megaTherion> cjohnson: sure, its about prevention
[13:12:36] <cjohnson> if it's something simple and common, chances are the community has done a better job covering all its bases than you will
[13:12:38] <robertmaxrees> prevention of what?
[13:12:56] <robertmaxrees> put another - do you have any examples, megaTherion?
[13:13:02] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: not reinventing the wheel
[13:13:09] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[13:13:17] <Robdgreat> "all of them :)"
[13:13:24] <robertmaxrees> but they said "libs are often far too buggy for my purposes :)"
[13:13:29] <megaTherion> cjohnson: my experience is, is that 1000 people are all using things of based 2-3 peoples good work, not fixing stuff - and you get one single bug which appears in all those sites of 1000 people (approximation)
[13:13:40] <megaTherion> cjohnson: same with other stuff, which is dealed the same way
[13:13:51] <cjohnson> in which libraries do you have that experience megaTherion
[13:14:23] <megaTherion> Im not speaking of specific libraries, this situation appears overall in IT, especially in Web development and in other fields - for example SOHO routers - same sad story
[13:14:30] <Robdgreat> figured.
[13:14:37] <cjohnson> you're saying "in my experience". I'm asking you to qualify your statement
[13:14:39] <Robdgreat> not a single concrete example, just nebulous generalizations
[13:14:42] <cjohnson> otherwise it sounds like a bunch of crap
[13:14:52] <robertmaxrees> megaTherion i haven't shared your experience at all.
[13:15:02] <Robdgreat> if it's so widespread, it should be really, really easy to give even a single example
[13:15:10] <megaTherion> Robdgreat: read news
[13:15:15] <cjohnson> heh
[13:15:17] <Robdgreat> still nothing.
[13:15:37] <Robdgreat> megaTherion: if you're going to make a contention, you should be prepared to back it up with data
[13:15:52] <robertmaxrees> especially in a chat room dedicated to a library :)
[13:16:32] <megaTherion> Robdgreat: I dont care a lot, I'll not discus such a lengthy topic now - I didnt address jQuery, I didnt say this is always the case - but its the case often enough, if people tend to ignore this fact then this also shows that the attitude of the people is responsible for the problems which appear
[13:16:54] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:17:07] <megaTherion> "<cjohnson> I let libs do the work" - says everything how most ppl think :)
[13:17:20] <bobtheboss> howdy, i was wondering if i could get a quick pointer. i have accordian with ajax content. the first time it loads, it's size is based on empty div. if i collapse and reopen it's animation works since it's already loaded content. how do i fix this? i threw some breaks in there, sort of works, but not the best.
[13:17:21] <cjohnson> that the power of many is greater than the power of one?
[13:17:23] <megaTherion> by libs they also mean, "I let others do the work and hope nothing breaks"
[13:17:32] <robertmaxrees> megaTherion because often times things don't break.
[13:17:39] <megaTherion> cjohnson: sadly this is not often true, but I'd wish it would be always the case
[13:17:42] <cjohnson> you're making a mountain of assumptions
[13:17:49] <robertmaxrees> megaTherion you made the claim that there are often bugs in libraries - we're asking you to back that statement up.
[13:17:50] <megaTherion> cjohnson: compare all people on the world, how many are on research, how many are leechers :)
[13:17:53] <BillCriswell> Assumption Mountain
[13:17:56] <jikuja> otoh reinventing wheel and NIH
[13:17:57] <Robdgreat> things don't break enough of the time that it becomes worthwhile not wasting time duplicating effort
[13:18:10] <cjohnson> there's nothing wrong with consuming
[13:18:11] <megaTherion> robertmaxrees: read news, read daily news about security each day... why do I need to back up such common fact :(
[13:18:21] <robertmaxrees> megaTherion you're convoluting things.
[13:18:27] <Robdgreat> megaTherion: because you made a claim
[13:18:30] <robertmaxrees> javascript libraries vs backend frameworks.
[13:18:30] <cjohnson> I'd rather let the guy who dedicates his life figure out the nuances than have me attempt to pretend I'm an expert
[13:18:32] <Robdgreat> that libs are buggy
[13:18:52] <Robdgreat> then you want us to do your research for you to defend it?
[13:18:55] <Robdgreat> give me a break.
[13:18:58] <cjohnson> heh
[13:19:02] <robertmaxrees> megaTherion you're still making generalizations.
[13:19:05] <megaTherion> robertmaxrees: it is not restricted to backend/frontend, client/server, its a general issue
[13:19:08] <megaTherion> robertmaxrees: of course I do
[13:19:12] <Robdgreat> Not happening.
[13:19:13] <robertmaxrees> i disagree.
[13:19:30] <cjohnson> it's rare #jquery gets trolld so effectively, my hat comes off
[13:19:46] <BillCriswell> My hat as well.
[13:19:46] <BillCriswell> My XXL hat.
[13:19:47] <robertmaxrees> i doubt they're trolling.  i just think they're making generalizations.
[13:19:59] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: the mark of a successful troll
[13:20:25] <robertmaxrees> i thinkt they're genuine, but meh.
[13:20:32] <megaTherion> cjohnson: ok you saying there are no bugs, there never will be and the percentage of good people working on libs and people using libs is equal - your belief
[13:20:38] <cjohnson> yep. that's what I said
[13:20:45] <robertmaxrees> megaTherion that's not what he's saying at all.
[13:20:50] <robertmaxrees> stop generalizing.
[13:20:54] <megaTherion> robertmaxrees: its the other side of the extreme
[13:20:57] <Robdgreat> megaTherion: you're contending that your code will have no bugs
[13:21:21] <Robdgreat> Ever.
[13:21:29] <robertmaxrees> or security holes.
[13:21:30] <megaTherion> I never said that... but its easier to maintain less code than more
[13:21:33] <bobtheboss> im trying to take over the world, http://fractalfederation.tumblr.com/ fix my accordian
[13:21:37] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:21:48] <robertmaxrees> bobtheboss bad way to get help.
[13:22:00] <cjohnson> hah
[13:22:10] <cjohnson> what's wrong with it
[13:22:11] <robertmaxrees> megaTherion libraries often let you do exactly that.
[13:22:12] <cjohnson> seems ok here
[13:22:13] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: no, only libs have bugs
[13:22:17] <robertmaxrees> you get to maintain "less code"
[13:22:17] <Robdgreat> and security holes
[13:22:26] <robertmaxrees> stand on the shoulders of others.
[13:22:27] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[13:22:32] <bobtheboss> first load doesn't take into consideration the length of the content
[13:23:05] <megaTherion> robertmaxrees: apart from all the code you dont know, might not understand - again Im generalizing on purpose, Im not speaking about jquery or even js, feel free to apply that scheme also to php frameworks or whatever
[13:23:21] <cjohnson> bobtheboss: need more details, not sure what you mean by that
[13:23:25] <robertmaxrees> megaTherion php is a fractal of bad design, so that's  a terrible example.
[13:23:31] <robertmaxrees> and i still say you're wrong.
[13:23:33] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[13:23:40] <robertmaxrees> agree to disagree i guess ;)
[13:23:52] <arschmitz> megaTherion: the problem is your assuming you know more about security and the potential loop holes then the people working on the libs and frameworks
[13:24:01] <megaTherion> robertmaxrees: but PHP is used a lot, isnt it? or things like wordpress? :)
[13:24:08] <cjohnson> do you build your own car engines as well megaTherion?
[13:24:11] <cjohnson> cars are pretty common.
[13:24:14] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[13:24:15] <arschmitz> which for good ones is likely not true
[13:24:18] <Robdgreat> cjohnson: have to. someone else's car is buggy
[13:24:20] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[13:24:22] <cjohnson> heh
[13:25:01] <megaTherion> arschmitz: quite the opposite
[13:25:17] <virgomoon> I do so hate to interrupt the banter, but .. I have an accordion with 2 divs in a 2-tab panel in a dialog.  It seems the tab panel is taking on the height of the combination of the 2 accordion divs before being made into an accordion.  Is this just how dialog or tabs calculate their heights or something?
[13:26:00] <robertmaxrees> megaTherion then do you hand roll your own OS?
[13:26:08] <megaTherion> no
[13:26:13] <megaTherion> I also dont build my own cars
[13:26:19] <robertmaxrees> all the major OSs have massive security holes that get reported.
[13:26:21] <megaTherion> I doubt I'd be able to
[13:26:22] <robertmaxrees> by the news.
[13:26:28] <megaTherion> robertmaxrees: exacly
[13:26:33] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[13:26:45] <robertmaxrees> i think you're missing my point.
[13:26:47] <robertmaxrees> but OK.
[13:26:52] <megaTherion> no I dont miss your point :)
[13:27:01] <arschmitz> megaTherion: do you write your own anti virus software?
[13:27:04] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[13:27:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:27:13] <megaTherion> arschmitz: I dont use snake oil
[13:27:26] <robertmaxrees> arschmitz they've been at it long enough and their logic is circular enough that i don't think they're going to see the light.
[13:27:47] <arschmitz> yeah im sure i have better things to do lol
[13:27:55] <arschmitz> pr's to review or something
[13:28:01] <Robdgreat> robertmaxrees: some just want to watch the world burn
[13:28:11] <robertmaxrees> i doubt they're malicious.
[13:28:33] <robertmaxrees> and i'm sure they got bit by something at some point.,
[13:28:37] <robertmaxrees> it happens.
[13:28:40] <Robdgreat> but can't say whaat
[13:28:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:29:22] <Robdgreat> "all <particular group of people> are untrustworthy!" "name one" "all of them! Duh, it's obvious!"
[13:29:36] <robertmaxrees> I'd let it go at this point.\
[13:29:37] <bobtheboss> accordian with ajax, when you click it the first time, it's an empty div, so the animations only scales for the empty div, then the content is loaded AFTER the animations. after that you can collapse and it animates properly. it's just the first load that has the problem
[13:30:09] <robertmaxrees> bobtheboss you need to put your accordion code in the .done() callback of your ajax call.
[13:30:12] <robertmaxrees> and with that, I leave for lunch.
[13:30:14] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
[13:31:20] <pentagrass> soooo how exactly does a javascript source "black box"?
[13:34:31] <sives> Hello! Say I have an input tag that runs a function when enter is pressed. This function then creates a new input and appends it to the body. How do I get the created input to run the same function? If I press enter in the dynamically created one, nothing happens.
[13:35:01] <pentagrass> Can a client side app have encryption that only the user can see? (without regarding mitm attacks)
[13:35:10] <megaTherion> cjohnson: anyways thx again, progressbar works now
[13:35:59] <megaTherion> Im outta here, thanks guys - keep track of the code you write, dont even suggest that quanity is better than quality, we dont want to become Sony :p
[13:40:00] <NemesisD> anyone know why a synthetic event called with trigger() doesn't trigger a handler registered with the native dom API? http://jsfiddle.net/dg1gad9p/
[13:47:57] <cjohnson> that's just how it works. call .click() on the DOM and have it proliferate to the jquery handler instead?
[13:48:03] <cjohnson> .get(0).click() btw
[13:48:08] <cjohnson> to avoid the jquery click method
[13:48:34] <cjohnson> I think you prob want to bind to document.body though?
[13:59:17] <kegster> What is the best way to have an image watermark added to an image with a CENTER/CENTER position? I found watermark.js but it won't let me center position
[13:59:58] <decx> doing that with js makes no sense
[14:00:41] <BillCriswell> kegster: transparent png over an image?
[14:01:28] <kegster> yeah i was  thinking with CSS but they reealllly want it part of the image
[14:01:42] <kegster> i don't want to do it server side, and jquery can provide the image source itself
[14:01:54] <kegster> BillCriswell, but yes, an overlay not watermark
[14:02:17] <decx> what's the application
[14:02:20] <BillCriswell> kegster: The image would need to be available client side without the watermark anyway for javascript to do it.
[14:03:29] <kegster> yeah i'm not worried about someone actually getting it. he (client) is aware it's not full proof.
[14:03:41] <kegster> i just decided i'd ask before i go and play around ;)
[14:03:49] <decx> canvas&drawImage
[14:05:55] <BillCriswell> decx method would be the way then.
[14:07:14] <kegster> hmm ok perfect thank you then :D
[14:23:14] <decx> that was easy
[14:24:41] <Jattenalle> i prefer watermarking with PHP.. since anyone with half a brain will be able to extract the raw unmarked image if you just mark it with JS
[14:24:46] * Jattenalle shrugs
[14:25:19] <decx> apparently that's not a concern
[14:25:34] <decx> hence why i asked what the application was
[14:26:06] <Jattenalle> ah yeah, i see it up there
[14:26:37] <Jattenalle> heh, it amuses me
[14:26:45] <Jattenalle> all these apple computers going to sleep
[14:33:27] <ekke85> hello, can someone give me a hand with datatables please?
[14:33:39] <ekke85> can i paste code in pastebin or something?
[14:38:50] <ekke85> this is what i have
[14:38:51] <ekke85> https://dpaste.de/LPYZ
[14:39:07] <ekke85> if i hit the url i get the table with no data
[14:39:20] <ekke85> the ajax bit is not even trying to access the url
[14:39:54] <ekke85> help me irc, you are my last hope ;)
[14:39:58] <Jattenalle> ekke85, same origin policy?
[14:40:14] <ekke85> yes, it is all just on localhost
[14:40:17] <ekke85> it is django
[14:40:32] <ekke85> so django creates the json for me
[14:40:42] * Jattenalle shrugs
[14:40:43] <ekke85> and i print to the console when i hit the url
[14:40:43] <Jattenalle> no idea
[14:40:48] <ekke85> noooooo
[14:41:48] <ekke85> the alert("done"); does fire
[14:41:53] <ekke85> it gives me the alert
[14:42:17] <ekke85> and if i add an alert after the columns that load 12
[14:42:23] <ekke85> 2 not 12
[15:10:21] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I'm using slick slider in combination with magnific popup.  On open of the pop-up, I'm init'ed a slick slider, and on close, I'd like to unslick it.  However, the unslick seems to remove all of the navigation from any other uninit'ed sliders on the page...
[15:14:26] <_DB> how do i set the value of a input field to nulll $('#module_title').val();
[15:16:11] <jakery> $('#module_title').val('')
[16:09:18] <kuil10> jakery is right.
[16:12:30] <LindsayMac> Hey guys. I have this pretty little bit of code that takes a UL and makes it look like a pretty drop down. It even updates the parent element and it all works exactly how I wanted it to. I am now trying to figure out a way to get the data-value in my HTML to pass to a JS event (I will be appending it to the URL to make an AJAX query ) http://jsfiddle.net/c11urs5t/1/
[16:12:44] <LindsayMac> I just can't seem to get the value of the selected element go anywhere
[16:14:27] <robertmaxrees> "pass a js event"
[16:14:28] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:17:07] <LindsayMac> sorry my syntax isn't right.. I just want to do "something" with the data value.. so really if working in a simple setting, if I can just have someone give me an "alert" witht he data-value content i can go from there
[16:17:38] <LindsayMac> I'm just having a hard time grabbing the right data when I select an element and it's updated to the top level HTML element.
[16:19:31] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: ^
[16:20:26] <robertmaxrees> iiinteresting way to do this.
[16:20:50] <robertmaxrees> and what you need is an event listener.
[16:21:09] <robertmaxrees> any particular reason you're using a constructor to do this?
[16:21:36] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  not particularly. I've read abunch of tutorials and I found this way the easiest for me to follow.
[16:21:54] <robertmaxrees> huh.  okay.
[16:22:01] <LindsayMac> and yes.. don't I have an event listener in the form of obj.opts.on('click', function() ?
[16:22:06] <LindsayMac> I was thinking I would put it in there.. that way
[16:22:13] <LindsayMac> if you have a better suggestion, I am open to it
[16:22:28] <LindsayMac> Js is not my strongest suite. i'm more in PHP ..
[16:22:38] <robertmaxrees> it seems like you know where the code should go.
[16:22:41] <robertmaxrees> so what have you tried?
[16:22:44] <LindsayMac> i am pretty good with JS when it involves dealing with data, but display related JS gets me all sorts of confused
[16:22:58] <LindsayMac> am I right that the code should go there?
[16:23:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:23:17] <robertmaxrees> probably ;)
[16:23:28] <robertmaxrees> a quick console.log() could confirm that for you.
[16:24:58] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  i added 	jQuery(this).data('value'); to the click function and then $.ajax after that
[16:25:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:25:53] <LindsayMac> lemme update my code
[16:25:55] <LindsayMac> in jsfiddle
[16:26:20] <robertmaxrees> did you try to console.log(jQuery(this).data('value'))?
[16:26:44] <robertmaxrees> and if so, what did you get?
[16:26:51] <robertmaxrees> because it's a pretty simple change to make.
[16:27:02] <robertmaxrees> (this is partially why I don't like using constructors for things like this.
[16:27:43] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  do you have a different stuggestion or tutorial to link to that achieves something like this?
[16:27:50] <LindsayMac> I am TOTALLYT open to learning a different method
[16:28:26] <robertmaxrees> i could do this pretty easily but i don't really have time to step through it.
[16:28:31] <robertmaxrees> either way - you really want the event.target
[16:28:33] <robertmaxrees> not this
[16:28:48] <robertmaxrees> the issue is your this object isn't what you think it is.
[16:29:10] <LindsayMac> event.target?
[16:29:46] <robertmaxrees> you said you want the value of your data-value attribute, right?
[16:29:58] <robertmaxrees> did you try doing console.log(jQuery(this).data('value')); ?
[16:30:04] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/c11urs5t/2/
[16:30:28] <LindsayMac> ah my syntax was wrong
[16:30:32] <LindsayMac> i tried it but did it wrong ok
[16:30:34] <LindsayMac> now i see
[16:30:51] <LindsayMac> that gives me "undefined
[16:31:18] <LindsayMac> ahhh
[16:31:21] <LindsayMac> yiou were right.
[16:31:27] <LindsayMac> event.target gives me what I need
[16:31:28] <LindsayMac> PERFECTION
[16:31:45] <robertmaxrees> do this - console.log(jQuery(this));
[16:31:51] <robertmaxrees> it'll show you the real issue.
[16:32:30] <robertmaxrees> long story short, obj.opts is your LIs.
[16:32:30] <Omar-> LindsayMac http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/c11urs5t/3/
[16:32:41] <LindsayMac> ah i see robertmaxrees
[16:32:41] <robertmaxrees> the data attribute is on the anchors though
[16:32:46] <Omar-> data-value is stored in anchor
[16:33:01] <LindsayMac> wait but event.target worked
[16:33:05] <LindsayMac> is that going ot cause issues
[16:33:17] <LindsayMac> if I use event.target instead of 'this"
[16:33:18] <Omar-> li is receiving the click. so use $("a", this).data("value")
[16:33:25] <robertmaxrees> Omar- errr.
[16:33:30] <robertmaxrees> event.target will fix the problem though.
[16:33:38] <LindsayMac> Omar-:  not really.
[16:33:41] <Omar-> robertmaxrees lol
[16:33:51] <robertmaxrees> and it's technically "the right way"
[16:33:54] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  event.target did.. so if it works, and it does make sense to me that it does work...
[16:34:06] <LindsayMac> does it make sense to do it that way or should i use Omar- method?
[16:34:07] <Omar-> robertmaxrees true
[16:34:17] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c11urs5t/5/
[16:34:19] <LindsayMac> which is the "technically right way"?
[16:34:22] <robertmaxrees> just make sure you define the event object.
[16:34:31] <robertmaxrees> technically the right way is to not do what you're doing here lol
[16:34:39] <robertmaxrees> but short of that, you want the event target
[16:34:39] <LindsayMac> ugh..
[16:34:54] <LindsayMac> i know you dont have time to rewrite my code.. i dont expect you.. do you know of any tutorials you can pass my way?
[16:34:59] <sodacrunch> I have a textarea, I get its value, and then I want to pass to my mail.php with the var in the url,  so I can a $.get(mail.php?(vars here));
[16:35:05] <robertmaxrees> the jquery widget docs, LindsayMac
[16:35:07] <sodacrunch> im having trouble preserving the line breaks though
[16:35:23] <sodacrunch> http://hastebin.com/abiyiniqiw.avrasm is what I have
[16:35:33] <LindsayMac> k
[16:36:05] <robertmaxrees> LindsayMac the issue imo is that you're using a constructor in this case when you don't really need one.  it makes troubleshooting issues confusing and difficult.
[16:36:20] <LindsayMac> robertmaxrees:  understoof
[16:37:13] <LindsayMac> ah jquery widgets requires jquery UI though
[16:37:29] <LindsayMac> I have so far stayed away from loading that library since I didn't really need to yet
[16:38:19] <LindsayMac> My issue with learning to do this was getting the <span> to update with the selected bit after I clicked it
[16:38:26] <LindsayMac> this was the only way I could get it to work
[16:42:53] <Omar-> in widget factory, how to create a public function that can be called on child elements of the wrapper which is created using the widget?
[16:43:09] <Omar-> for example $("wrapper").listview()
[16:43:20] <Omar-> this creates the wrapper.
[16:44:08] <Omar-> If I want to call a function on child element e.g. $("wrapper child_elm").listview("delete")
[16:44:42] <Omar-> this doesn't work because child_elm cant be initialized using the main methid
[16:44:44] <Omar-> method
[16:44:59] <Omar-> how can I pass a function to a child element?
[16:45:14] <Omar-> http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/vzgLtrnL/
[16:45:48] <Omar-> to understand the issue, check the fiddle and left swipe elements.
[16:46:10] <Omar-> I have an internal function to open/close
[16:46:34] <Omar-> I want to call open/close outside the widget (manually)
[16:46:54] <Omar-> e.g. $("parent child_elm").swipeable("open")
[16:52:24] <Omar-> nevermind
[16:52:27] <Omar-> goodnight!
[16:53:47] <sorush20> hi
[16:54:11] <sorush20> could someone have a look at my page and check what I'm doing wrong witht he accordion?
[16:54:47] <sorush20> www.islingtontrainingcourses.co.uk/v2/index.php/microsoft-access
[17:00:08] <robertmaxrees> weee
[17:00:45] <Robdgreat> weeeees
[17:05:11] <sorush20> anyone?
[17:05:47] <robertmaxrees> sorush20 a small, self-contained example would be nice.
[17:12:15] <bigwax> man, why did i not know about .offsetParent()
[17:12:22] <bigwax> makes positioning things so much easier
[17:19:25] <sorush20> so the accordion will not work without css associated right?
[17:19:37] <robertmaxrees> the one from jquery ui?
[17:22:33] <sorush20> yes those ones
[17:22:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there's related CSS you need.
[17:23:21] <sorush20> that's why my accordion isn't working caause there isn't the ccss to work with
[17:32:26] <sorush20> still having the same problem
[17:32:43] <sorush20> http://www.islingtontrainingcourses.co.uk/v2/index.php/microsoft-access
[17:34:15] <robertmaxrees> fix the js error
[17:36:18] <kevireilly> anyone fairly familiar with providing DOM context to jQuery calls? IE: $(el, context);
[17:36:28] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:36:49] <kevireilly> I'm reading the source and trying to see if/how there is any use of importNode because I'm trying to do something similar (since I don't have access to jquery at this point in the code) and I'm failing miserably with some DOM exceptions and other strange behavior
[17:37:08] <robertmaxrees> bwuh?  why don't you have jquery?
[17:37:22] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: it is loaded later as part of a requirejs dependency
[17:37:28] <kevireilly> but I need to do some magic before this point
[17:37:56] <robertmaxrees> can't you try to load it and then require knows not to re-load it?
[17:38:13] <kevireilly> mmm just had an idea while trying to explain, let me try that first before wasting anyone's time
[17:38:20] <doublel93>  /msg NickServ identify aaaaaa
[17:38:43] <kevireilly> robertmaxrees: good question, this is actually an inherited project and I'm not very versed in requirejs
[17:40:19] <turetto87> hey, could someone tell why this code doesn't work ? it prints the first alert but not the second one  http://pastebin.com/mG6aLYZ3
[17:47:03] <kuil10> turetto87: wait a sec
[17:47:22] <robertmaxrees> he's already gone.
[17:47:25] <robertmaxrees> it was a syntax error.
[17:47:32] <kuil10> k
[17:47:45] <kuil10> too sad :(
[17:54:27] <sorush20> I'm truely stuck
[17:58:49] <sorush20> robertmaxrees: could you just tell me what the problem is I don't know why its going worng. I've got the css script but the code in the html is probably the proble
[17:58:52] <sorush20> m
[17:58:58] <sorush20> could you take a look
[17:59:57] <kuil10> sorush20: what's going on?
[18:01:21] <robertmaxrees> "css script"
[18:01:24] <robertmaxrees> and look at your console.
[18:01:27] <robertmaxrees> simple error.
[18:02:04] <robertmaxrees>  $(...).Accordion is wrong.
[18:02:20] <robertmaxrees> $('#accordion').accordion(); is what you want.
[18:03:48] <robertmaxrees> or whatever the selector is.
[18:04:29] <robertmaxrees> why do you have mootools AND jquery on this page?
[18:04:31] <robertmaxrees> don't do that :(
[18:04:36] <andrew9183> do you guys use hammer ?
[18:05:12] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ andrew9183
[18:05:12] <b-ot> andrew9183: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[18:05:47] <andrew9183> heh
[18:07:24] <sorush20> I've just changed that but still nothing. Uncaught type error
[18:09:07] <sorush20> I'm under the impression that the css from the jquery ui contains the acccordion selector or class
[18:09:23] <robertmaxrees> that means that the accordion function doesn't exist.
[18:09:42] <sorush20> so there is no function in the jquery ui ?
[18:09:49] <sorush20> where is it then?
[18:09:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:10:09] <robertmaxrees> you have to load the jquery ui js
[18:10:31] <sorush20> I think I have it there in the header
[18:10:31] <robertmaxrees> probably not apart of core.
[18:11:35] <robertmaxrees> ^probably not apart of core.
[18:20:59] <sorush20> robertmaxrees: thanks for that
[18:21:02] <sorush20> works
[18:21:15] <sorush20> good night
[18:47:53] <Tagor> Is it possible to detect when a function is called and then run more code?
[19:00:39] <andrew9183> anyone have a suggested mobile slider that implements inertia
[19:08:00] <mitzev_> i have a checkbox in a div, i want to select a table in the same div if the checkbox is checked
[19:08:10] <mitzev_> how do i find it?
[19:49:50] <systemfault> Not really.. you'd need to proxy the function in question
[20:13:35] <andrew9183> closest(‘div’).find('table')
[20:14:15] <andrew9183> what are you ‘selecting'
[20:14:43] <mitzev_> thx
[20:19:41] <blindMoe> can anyone recommend a jquery powered slider that can mimic this: https://www.sequoiacap.com/
[20:20:09] <blindMoe> I imagine it can be done with layer slider but it seems like too much for what I need
[21:42:06] <parveen> how to change global variable value from inside the function ?
[21:43:16] <robertmaxrees> by changing it.
[21:43:29] <Uhkis> :D
[21:43:37] <robertmaxrees> nothing special
[21:43:52] <parveen> i tried but its not working, let me send link
[21:44:05] <robertmaxrees> as long as you didn't redeclare the variable in the current scope or a parent scope along the way, you're fine.
[21:45:10] <robertmaxrees> parveen http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/77mg8p4j/
[21:47:40] <parveen> Thanks robertmaxrees , checking
[21:48:26] <parveen> robertmaxrees  http://jsfiddle.net/parveen14/peecssp4/
[21:48:36] <parveen> check this -- http://jsfiddle.net/parveen14/peecssp4/
[21:48:45] <robertmaxrees> console.log yo
[21:49:20] <robertmaxrees> and the issue is that the variables you pass to the function are scoped to the function.
[21:49:24] <robertmaxrees> you're passing the reference.
[21:50:19] <parveen> how can i chnage it now?
[21:50:40] <robertmaxrees> by not passing them in.
[21:50:44] <Uhkis> remove the function arguments
[21:51:14] <parveen> yesss , got it , Thanks robertmaxrees
[22:05:00] <rodux> hello
[22:05:07] <root3d> hi
[22:05:40] <rodux> i’m having a small problem, is anyone available to help?
[22:05:47] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ rodux
[22:05:47] <b-ot> rodux: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[22:05:50] <root3d> rodux, just ask
[22:06:03] <rodux> :)
[22:07:52] <rodux> ok. I am trying to use the jquery ui 1.11.2 with adobe edge animate.. to make something which uses the “draggable” feature.. I keep looking at the tutorials, and following the instructions, watched alot of stuff on youtube… but it just never seems to work
[22:08:09] <rodux> i am also very new to this.
[22:08:14] <robertmaxrees> "adobe edge animate"?
[22:08:23] <rodux> yes
[22:08:24] <root3d> rodux, show some code & error
[22:09:17] <robertmaxrees> rodux edge animate is not really a web browser.
[22:09:30] <robertmaxrees> isn't it for presentations?
[22:09:49] <robertmaxrees> ooooh no it's for other content.
[22:10:09] <rodux> its a way of creating content, animations with html5
[22:10:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, an example of broken code would be helpful.
[22:11:34] <rodux> yepnope(
[22:11:35] <rodux> {
[22:11:36] <rodux> }nope:[
[22:11:38] <rodux> 'js/jquery-ui.min.js'
[22:11:39] <rodux> ],
[22:11:40] <robertmaxrees> not in here.
[22:11:41] <rodux> complete: init
[22:11:42] <rodux> });
[22:11:44] <rodux> function init() {
[22:11:45] <rodux> sym.$('REC').draggable({
[22:11:46] <robertmaxrees> in a fixee or jsfiddle.
[22:11:47] <rodux> start: function(e){}
[22:11:48] <rodux> drag: function (e,ui){}
[22:11:50] <rodux> });
[22:11:51] <rodux> }
[22:11:51] <rodux> lol
[22:11:53] <rodux> sorry
[22:12:21] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.
[22:13:52] <rodux> so I went there
[22:14:03] <rodux> and how do I direct you to it?
[22:14:22] <robertmaxrees> hit "save", share the URL.
[22:14:29] <rodux> i know, i know… I can hear my ownself saying noob…
[22:14:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:14:37] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[22:14:42] <rodux> http://jsfiddle.net/ga2cu6ms/
[22:15:00] <robertmaxrees> that's missing a lot of other code.
[22:15:06] <rodux> yeah
[22:15:18] <rodux> its supposed to load the library
[22:15:25] <robertmaxrees> i don't care about that part.
[22:15:51] <rodux> thats what in the video
[22:15:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:16:00] <robertmaxrees> what video?
[22:16:08] <rodux> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YrZQbjqtFQ
[22:16:16] <rodux> i dont speak french
[22:16:20] <rodux> very well..
[22:16:35] <rodux> well… actually I did understand him..
[22:16:48] <rodux> but…
[22:16:49] <rodux> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4R8jFI_DeE
[22:17:00] <rodux> this is a better one… and this didnt work
[22:18:15] <rodux> i am really new to this, its all quite fascinating.  but I clearly am at the deep end of the swimming pool
[22:18:29] <robertmaxrees> you're tackling two things together.
[22:18:35] <robertmaxrees> edge animate and jquery ui
[22:18:41] <robertmaxrees> which makes it really hard.
[22:19:06] <rodux> hard for me
[22:19:11] <rodux> or you
[22:19:12] <rodux> lol
[22:19:27] <robertmaxrees> so a few things\
[22:19:32] <robertmaxrees> sym.$('REC').draggable(); should be all you need.
[22:19:41] <robertmaxrees> but that assumes your thing is named 'REC;'
[22:19:56] <rodux> its a rectangle
[22:20:04] <rodux> converted to a sysmbol
[22:20:11] <rodux> called “REC”
[22:20:18] <robertmaxrees> so be aware that nobody else in here will know anything about edge animate.
[22:20:38] <robertmaxrees> so the name is REC ?
[22:20:43] <rodux> yeah, I know I am asking a lot...
[22:20:52] <rodux> thx so much though
[22:21:46] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ga2cu6ms/1/
[22:21:48] <robertmaxrees> try this
[22:23:53] <rodux> that didnt work
[22:24:26] <robertmaxrees> you copied everything, right?
[22:24:28] <rodux> this is on the stage, the creationComplete
[22:24:36] <rodux> yes
[22:24:36] <robertmaxrees> none of that means anything to m.
[22:24:49] <robertmaxrees> open up your web browser.
[22:24:56] <robertmaxrees> rather
[22:25:04] <robertmaxrees> this runs stuff in your browser, right?
[22:25:44] <rodux> no, its some ide from adobe
[22:25:57] <rodux> with a timeline and stuff..  lol
[22:25:59] <robertmaxrees> wait so how are you verifying if your code works?
[22:26:27] <rodux> command return previews in browser
[22:26:34] <rodux> and I did that,
[22:26:42] <robertmaxrees> cool, okay.
[22:26:48] <sorush20> hello again robertmaxrees
[22:27:06] <robertmaxrees> rodux so when that happens, you need to open up your developer tools
[22:27:08] <robertmaxrees> hey sorush20
[22:27:13] <robertmaxrees> rodux and go to the console
[22:27:18] <TeddyMurray> why is the jquery mobile channel closed? i need help making a custom select button
[22:27:36] <robertmaxrees> TeddyMurray because this is where you'd get help for that.
[22:27:46] <TeddyMurray> awesome, let me pastebin
[22:28:07] <TeddyMurray> actually im just copying an example and the styling isn't showing
[22:28:12] <sorush20> Just wanted to say that the code worked for a while but then it stopped working. http://www.islingtontrainingcourses.co.uk/v2/index.php/microsoft-access
[22:28:13] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle it.
[22:28:47] <robertmaxrees> sorush20 there's waaaaay too much going on in there.
[22:29:03] <robertmaxrees> and i can't remember what i helped you with.
[22:29:15] <sorush20> the accordion
[22:29:23] <sorush20> Its a joomla template
[22:29:36] <robertmaxrees> "the accordion" doesn't mean anything to me.
[22:30:13] <sorush20> you helped me setup the firing code for an accordion and I was also missing the jquery ui
[22:30:28] <robertmaxrees> i'll believe you i guess (shrug)
[22:30:35] <robertmaxrees> so something isn't working any more.
[22:30:47] <gtristan> hi
[22:30:48] <robertmaxrees> what did you change?
[22:30:59] <sorush20> the same accordion , it disappears
[22:31:10] <gtristan> when I do $(node).click (function (event) { ... });
[22:31:22] <gtristan> in the function, or on the event object... where is 'node' ?
[22:31:33] <robertmaxrees> gtristan what do you mean "where is it"?
[22:31:42] <gtristan> event.target ?
[22:31:52] <robertmaxrees> $(this), event.target
[22:31:58] <robertmaxrees> few different ways to get it beyond that.
[22:32:10] <gtristan> robertmaxrees, thanks
[22:32:21] * gtristan will use event.target
[22:32:29] <robertmaxrees> use $(this)
[22:32:40] <robertmaxrees> it's slightly more idiomatic
[22:32:42] <rodux> i’m gonna go and figure it out…
[22:32:45] <mitzev_> i have a table with some rows containging td's with <span>'s
[22:33:03] <rodux> thanks so much robert…I’ll be on jsfiddle
[22:33:07] <mitzev_> i want to check if a row's td's has one or more <span> tags, and then make the entire row bolded, how?
[22:33:15] <gtristan> robertmaxrees, that really confuses things though, in a JS class I think 'this' should really refer to the implementing class - anything else is hard to read
[22:33:24] <gtristan> anyway
[22:33:28] <robertmaxrees> mitzev_ in your backend instead if possible.
[22:33:42] <robertmaxrees> gtristan javascript doesn't have classes.
[22:33:45] <robertmaxrees> sooo.
[22:33:53] <robertmaxrees> mitzev_ there's a .has()
[22:33:57] <mitzev_> yes i think so too
[22:33:59] <gtristan> sure it does, if you write it properly :)
[22:33:59] <mitzev_> but its too late for that now
[22:34:03] <mitzev_> so i need to fix it with js
[22:34:18] <robertmaxrees> gtristan you can introduce psuedoclassical constructs, sure, but then you're just begging for pain.
[22:34:20] <gtristan> where properly translates to: restrained in such a way as to implement OO concepts soundly enough :)
[22:34:42] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason most JS devs use `this` to refer to elements in handlers.
[22:35:17] <mitzev_> thx Robdgreat
[22:35:20] <mitzev_> thx robertmaxrees *
[22:36:40] <robertmaxrees> sure
[22:36:45] <TeddyMurray> robertmaxrees, i figured it out, jqueryui was conflicting with jqueryui mobile
[22:36:56] <robertmaxrees> TeddyMurray cool
[22:37:47] <sorush20> is that for me TeddyMurray
[22:37:57] <robertmaxrees> is what?
[22:38:02] <TeddyMurray> no sorush20
[22:38:06] <sorush20> oh okay
[23:07:59] <cjohnson> gtristan: there's more to OO than classes
[23:08:36] <cjohnson> it's not "more proper" to use one method of OO over another. it's down to the project needs and personal preference and convention
[23:08:43] <cjohnson> and the language of course
[23:09:31] <gtristan> cjohnson, yes, sorry for being defensive - people can code in any which way they want - our way is the OO way
[23:10:02] <gtristan> many people on #javascript and freenode channels have some severely hostile opinions, and thus I get defensive
[23:10:09] <gtristan> no need to overreact though.
[23:10:11] <cjohnson> I think your'e conflating OO and classes though
[23:10:45] <gtristan> well, inheritance is a large part of what we do, OO usually covers that.
[23:11:04] <cjohnson> inheritance doesn't depend on classes either
[23:12:02] <gtristan> well, this really depends on what you mean by a 'class', in a highlevel POV, a 'class' is generally a 'type', a 'class of objects which provide a common API'
[23:12:24] <gtristan> when you implement OO, generally you have common structures referred to as 'classes' for derivation
[23:12:31] <gtristan> and you have classwide data and instance data
[23:12:55] <cjohnson> I'm aware of how classes work
[23:12:57] <cjohnson> my point is
[23:13:04] <cjohnson> the prototype chain gives us inheritance
[23:13:16] <cjohnson> you don't *have* to use classes to get inheritance
[23:14:02] <gtristan> cjohnson, and my point is that when you use the prototype chain to implement inheritance, it is not entirely incorrect to refer to those objects as classes
[23:14:19] <cjohnson> it's mostly incorrect
[23:14:27] <gtristan> it is only incorrect if you are referring to the implementation of classes in languages which support OO natively
[23:14:29] <cjohnson> they're class-like. but certainly not classes
[23:14:37] <cjohnson> Javascript supports OO natively
[23:14:42] <cjohnson> you're still conflating classes and OO
[23:14:48] <gtristan> sigh
[23:14:53] <cjohnson> indeed
[23:14:58] <gtristan> and we are having this discussion because... ?
[23:14:59] <gtristan> heh
[23:15:19] <cjohnson> because you're conflating classes with OO and generally on these sorts of channels we strive to help each other understand these topics better
[23:15:56] <cjohnson> if you'd prefer to carry on in ignorance, you're certainly free to. I'm not forcing you
[23:16:32] <gtristan> what you are doing is splitting hairs on issues of terminology
[23:16:40] <cjohnson> it's an important distinction
[23:16:58] <gtristan> chairs and sofas and stools are all part of a wide range of classes of seating devices/contraptions
[23:17:00] <cjohnson> because it helps people realize that trying to bring classes to a class-less form of OO is adding unnecessary headache
[23:17:12] <gtristan> hence the word 'class' in this instance is entirely appropriate.
[23:17:41] <cjohnson> classes and prototypes are a range of implementations of OO. so the word OO is appropriate
[23:17:50] <cjohnson> calling a sofa a chair is wrong. calling them both seating devices is fine
[23:17:58] <cjohnson> anyway I'm not trying to just split hairs
[23:18:16] <cjohnson> I'm trying to drive home the point that trying to use concepts from the world of classes in JS tends to lead to headache
[23:18:29] <cjohnson> JS is a classless form of OO
[23:18:38] <gtristan> exactly, however calling them both 'classes' of seating devices is correct, as much as it is correct to say the same of two objects which derive from the same 'class', regardless of the technology they use to implement that derivation
[23:18:57] <cjohnson> you're using two different definitions of class in that sentence
[23:19:02] <cjohnson> there is no such thing as a class in JS
[23:19:06] <cjohnson> it's always just an instance
[23:19:07] <cjohnson> with a prototype
[23:19:13] <gtristan> I am indeed, intentionally, to prove a point.
[23:19:23] <cjohnson> in a class language, you have a class. and you have an instance
[23:19:26] <cjohnson> in Js there is no class
[23:19:29] <cjohnson> there is only instance
[23:19:51] <gtristan> i.e.:
[23:19:53] <gtristan> <gtristan> well, this really depends on what you mean by a 'class', in a highlevel POV, a 'class' is generally a 'type', a 'class of objects which provide a common API'
[23:20:00] <cjohnson> by class, I mean class
[23:20:00] <gtristan> to reiterate, we are going in circles
[23:20:16] <cjohnson> so again, trying to use concepts that apply to classes, no matter your definition, in a language that doesn't have them
[23:20:19] <cjohnson> makes no sense
[23:20:45] <gtristan> and that entirely depends on how you use the word 'class'
[23:20:59] <cjohnson> I'm talking about the correct definition of the word class
[23:21:12] <gtristan> ah, so your definition is the 'correct' one, I see.
[23:21:23] <cjohnson> nope, only the correct definition is correct. has nothing to do with "mine"
[23:21:42] <gtristan> this is really a pointless discussion, I'm sorry to have gotten sucked into it.
[23:21:51] <cjohnson> using the words class and instance interchangeably leads to such confusion as
[23:21:53] * gtristan apologizes to channel for useless banter
[23:21:54] <cjohnson> "that really confuses things though, in a JS class I think 'this' should really refer to the implementing class"
[23:22:48] <cjohnson> read up on .call/.apply if you haven't
[23:23:00] <cjohnson> it helps explain why the concept of "the implementing class" makes no sense in JS
[23:23:17] <cjohnson> actually this is a really great article

[23:23:51] <cjohnson> gtristan: ^
[23:26:35] <d3m0n> How would I go about using a jquery inview plugin and having an element follow my scrolling to a certain point?
[23:28:16] <cjohnson> gtristan: here's a fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/21s7kg4j/ Notice how displayName isn't defined on the prototype of anything, or as a property of any object
[23:30:06] <cjohnson> d3m0n: the docs? Which plugin are you thinking about
[23:30:36] <d3m0n> Well, I know to use the plugin. I am just not sure how I would go about making the element follow my scroll
[23:30:43] <cjohnson> you can use the CSS position: fixed to float an element in a static position relative to the viewport
[23:30:43] <d3m0n> That wouldn't be apart of the plugin I suppose
[23:31:31] <d3m0n> Well I thought about that too but I've seen sites where you scroll to a point and then it gets fixed, I am not sure how you would calculate where exactly you'd fix that element on that viewport
[23:31:43] <d3m0n> exactly where*
[23:31:53] <cjohnson> fix it to wherever you want it to be :P
[23:32:02] <cjohnson> position: fixed; top: 10px; left: 10px;
[23:32:12] <cjohnson> that fixes it to 10px from the top left corner
[23:32:45] <d3m0n> Yeah ha, ahh I wish I had an example. Let me try to find one
[23:32:52] <cjohnson> make a class that fixes it, and a class that puts it inline wherever you want it to be normally. on the event (inview or whatever else), change the class to the floating one
[23:35:10] <jnhghy> I'm trying to read the acceleration of my mobile device (samsung S3 and IPhone 5s) but using instanceOfDeviceMotionEvent.accelerationIncludingGravity seems to give me rotation state not acceleration, anybody up for a test or that has extra info?
[23:35:49] <cjohnson> I've got an iphone 5s if you want to test with me
[23:35:55] <cjohnson> totally clueless about that API though
[23:41:42] <jnhghy> cjohnson: thanks here it's a demo: http://tinyurl.com/3b6t6c2
[23:45:16] <cjohnson> it's hard to tell, the numbers are all over the place
[23:45:22] <cjohnson> what should I be looking for?
[23:45:25] <jnhghy> cjohnson: have a look at acceleration with mobile when you have your phone lat on the table it should have all values = 0
[23:45:37] <cjohnson> gtristan: here's another good jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/5vcx25wL/
[23:45:48] <jnhghy> cjohnson: acceleration with gravity better yet
[23:46:35] <cjohnson> around 0, 0, -9.8
[23:46:43] <cjohnson> accel is all 0s
[23:47:10] <Chulbul> I'm using jq grid plugin, but I have to include migrate.js also to make it work, although Im using latest jquery.js.
[23:47:29] <jnhghy> cjohnson: and if you bring your phone facing you? (same orientation as you monitor)
[23:47:36] <cjohnson> jnhghy: can you make the display average the past 20 frames or something like that in another column? it would be easier to monitor the difference
[23:48:29] <cjohnson> 1, -9.8, 1 accelerationIncludingGravity
[23:48:31] <cjohnson> when it's facing me
[23:48:53] <jnhghy> cjohnson: not with that example, I didn't build a live testing app yet (I should do a fiddle)
[23:48:54] <cjohnson> acceleration seems to stay around -2 to 2 no matter what
[23:49:15] <cjohnson> rotation rate seems to spike while I'm lifting it up
[23:49:36] <jnhghy> cjohnson: yes but that shows rotation not acceleration (having 1, -9.8, 1) when facing you :(
[23:49:54] <cjohnson> 1, -9.8, 1  is accelerationIncludingGravity
[23:49:59] <cjohnson> or so says the label
[23:51:13] <jnhghy> cjohnson: thanks for the help, I have to make some fiddles and others tests now, thanks again!
[23:51:39] <Kartagis> why would jquery-migrate be identified as unsafe by browser, or rather, SSL?
[23:52:21] <cjohnson> no prob jnhghy
[23:52:30] <cjohnson> Kartagis: "or rather, SSL"?
[23:52:44] <cjohnson> are you mixing https and http?
[23:53:33] <Kartagis> cjohnson: it is identified as unsafe even though I load it locally
[23:54:34] <cjohnson> are you mising https and http?
[23:54:39] <cjohnson> what does "load it locally" mean?
[23:55:03] <Chulbul> after including migrate js im getting this message-> JQMIGRATE: jQuery.browser is deprecated
[23:56:29] <Chulbul> with /jquery-1.11.1.min.js and jquery.jqGrid.min.js
[23:57:13] <Cork> Chulbul: you can turn off deprication warnings in migrate if you want
[23:57:30] <cjohnson> Chulbul: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9638247/is-jquery-browser-deprecated
[23:57:48] <cjohnson> it was removed in 1.9. you're meant to find something else. I imagine there's a plugin to replace it
[23:57:54] <Kartagis> cjohnson: I'm using Drupal CMS, and using drupal_add_js('//code.jquery.com/jquery-migrate-1.2.1.min.js', 'file')
[23:58:00] <d3m0n> cjohnson: http://sammarkiewi.cz/
[23:58:05] <d3m0n> similar to the clothing elements
[23:59:54] <cjohnson> you can bind to the scroll event and then do math to change the element's left and top values based on the scroll position
