[18:50:41] <devslash> isnt $('#myid').prop('checked',true) supposed to check a checkbox and uncheck it if you pass a false value
[19:37:52] <shoky_> devslash: yes
[19:38:10] <shoky_> assuming non-ancient version of jquert
[19:38:12] <shoky_> jquery
[19:40:48] <devslash> ok thanks
[22:43:02] <Jonno_FTW> hello
[22:43:32] <Jonno_FTW> I'm doing a $.ajax with dataType: 'json
[22:43:41] <Jonno_FTW> but it always send it url encoded
[22:47:34] <Jonno_FTW> doing $.post() with 'json' as the last argument also gives the same result
[23:41:01] <shoky_> Jonno_FTW: the dataType setting is for the type of data you're expecting to get in the response, not the data you're sending with the request
[23:42:10] <shoky_> Jonno_FTW: to send json you can  $.ajax({..., contentType: 'application/json', data: JSON.stringify(yourDataObject) })
