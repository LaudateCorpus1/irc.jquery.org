[10:12:24] <jak2000> hi all
[10:12:55] <jak2000> how to count all rows with no value (blank) in 1 column? in this case: https://jsfiddle.net/qe4tf8sL/  the count is 2... thanks
[10:17:58] <shoky_> jak2000: $('table > tbody > tr > td:nth-child(2)').filter((i,td) => $(td).text().length === 0).length
[10:19:06] <shoky_> jak2000: actually you can also do this i think   $('table > tbody > tr > td:nth-child(2):empty').length
[10:19:38] <Cork> note the last one won't cound elements with only spaces in them
[10:19:54] <shoky_> well neither will the first one :p
[10:19:55] <Cork> (or line breaks)
[10:20:04] <Cork> true
[10:20:27] <Cork> so should prob start with defineing what is meant by blank :)
[10:24:46] <jak2000> empty: <td></td>
[10:25:27] <Cork> ok but not <td> </td> or <td>
[10:25:29] <Cork> </td>
[10:25:30] <Cork> ?
[10:26:28] <jak2000> not
[10:27:46] <Cork> then ya $('.gridtable tbody td:nth-child(2):empty').length should be enough
[10:28:26] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/qe4tf8sL/1/
[10:28:41] <jak2000> worked, testing corck tip
[10:29:35] <jak2000> https://jsfiddle.net/qe4tf8sL/2/  too work , thanks
[10:31:03] <jak2000> only for dude.... if the cell habe your advisement: <td> </td>   or why not count all cells in 2d column that contain: 'Mike' ?
[10:33:00] <Cork> if what your asking is how to check that, you would have to use .replace(/ +/, ' ').replace(/[\n ]+$/, '').replace(/^[\n ]+/, '')
[10:33:15] <Cork> and then check the resulting string with what you care about
[10:41:44] <jak2000> ok, thanks
[11:08:12] <rapha> hi all!
[11:08:46] <rapha> is there something like the :contains(text) selector, but a little more refined, so that you could, for example, only select things that _begin_ with the given string?
[11:10:31] <shoky_> rapha: .filter()
[11:37:24] <rapha> aha, so that's not just for element names. thank you, shoky_!
[12:18:39] <destramic> how do i get form name and values into multidimensional please guys? https://jsfiddle.net/destramic/7fu6yczs/
[12:33:30] <robertmaxrees> destramic that's... a really strange format for that data.
[12:39:18] <destramic> i wanna make the data multidemsional, is there a easy solution?
[12:39:40] <robertmaxrees> that's also not a valid data format :)
[12:39:50] <robertmaxrees> as in - it's invalid JS.
[12:41:19] <robertmaxrees> destramic why is that the format you want the data in?  why not submit as-is to the server and let the server handle parsing/transforming it?
[12:42:51] <destramic> casue i want to store the data as a draft in database
[12:43:27] <destramic> and when page is loaded back up i want the form data to be in a data attr so my script can add the values to the fields
[12:43:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so do the data massaging server-side.
[12:44:06] <robertmaxrees> or just do normal key/value relationships.
[12:45:06] <destramic> yeah i could do normal key values, but thought it would look better like this
[12:45:28] <robertmaxrees> "look better"?
[12:45:51] <destramic> the form is lengthy
[12:46:06] <robertmaxrees> normal name/value stores are what you generally want.
[12:46:17] <destramic> yeah ok
[12:46:20] <destramic> keep it simple
[12:46:22] <robertmaxrees> trying to get "clever" with data formats is a bad idea.
[12:46:22] <destramic> thank you
[12:46:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, readability over all else.
[12:46:59] <destramic> thank you for your help again
