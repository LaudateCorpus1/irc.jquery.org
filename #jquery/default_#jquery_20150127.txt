[00:06:21] <MoonFrog> Hi. I'm having some issues with deferred. The problem occurs when a deferred request is launched before a site does a redirect, and resolved AFTER the redirect
[00:07:39] <MoonFrog> Is it possible to stop all pending deferreds when a redirect is performed?
[00:09:08] <Cork> MoonFrog: you would have to catch the beforeunload event and trigger a failed event
[00:09:20] <Cork> MoonFrog: js doesn't run cross page reloads
[00:12:48] <MoonFrog> Cork: Not that familiar with beforeunload. Can you always catch that event, no matter what is triggering the redirect?
[00:12:52] <MoonFrog> The thing is that my component is being used as a widget a clients' asp.net site. The asp.net site is performing the redirect.
[00:13:38] <Cork> MoonFrog: the even fires when the page is about to be unloaded (before another page is loaded)
[00:13:52] <Cork> so it fires when links are clicked and anything else
[00:14:03] <Cork> MoonFrog: but note, it isn't fired in opera
[00:14:13] <Cork> and other browsers are talking about dropping the event
[00:14:14] <rhizome> hi all. is there a standard or common style to use that could refactor these lines? https://gist.github.com/rhizome/a695484b7e0518db4a98
[00:14:20] <rhizome> they just look like maybe they could be
[00:14:38] <MoonFrog> Cork: Thanks for the explanation. No opera support is fine. Just need IE and chrome support
[00:14:41] <Cork> rhizome: remove the second $('form#new_link')
[00:14:54] <rhizome> just chain the .on's?
[00:15:00] <Cork> ya
[00:15:06] <rhizome> sweet, thanks
[00:15:15] <Cork> also don't prefix id's with an element name
[00:15:38] <Cork> you convert it from a fast hash lookup to a slow tag search followed by a filter on an id
[00:15:58] <Cork> (and that is silly as ids are unique)
[00:17:59] <MoonFrog> Cork: How would I trigger a failed event? Is there any way to check all "pending deferreds"
[00:21:33] <MoonFrog> I wouldn't be sure which deferreds are pending at a given time. It's impossible to keep track of all all my deferreds manually. So I need some general way of failing any pending deferred
[00:23:26] <rhizome> Cork: ah, sure. makes sense!
[00:23:51] <Cork> MoonFrog: what are you using deferred on?
[00:31:51] <MoonFrog> Cork: I've got quite a large solution where all kinds of data is fetched asynchronously . Notifications, messages, stuff like that. So it would not be reasonable for me to manually keep track of all deferreds manually and check their state to find out if I need to cancel them
[00:32:09] <chargen> Hi. I have an animation that changes the width of a div but it's contentes are displaced during the animation. How Can I animate it with it's contents being moved?
[00:32:12] <MoonFrog> I've checked stackoverflow and seems like there's no viable solution to my problem
[00:32:29] <Cork> MoonFrog: could you please answer the question?
[00:33:03] <Cork> MoonFrog: deferred is a callback handling solution, what you use it with isn't indicated by "deferred"
[00:35:16] <MoonFrog> Cork: I'm using on functions. like this: '$.when( getStuff() ).then(function(stuff) { ... });'
[00:35:47] <Omar-> good morning
[00:37:28] <Cork> MoonFrog: ok... lets back this up a bit
[00:37:35] <Cork> why do you need to know when the page unloads?
[00:37:54] <Cork> the js is unloaded at the same time, so everything is stopped anyway
[00:53:32] <chargen> can you help me out please? I want to change a div width without messing up it's contents position. I got something quite like what I want with white-space: nowrap but maybe there's a better way.
[01:04:56] <Omar-> chargen can you create a fiddle?
[01:05:08] <kwladyka> I am looking photo gallery like on https://www.airbnb.pl/rooms/1620835?s=Imyk please click on image and then gallery will open. I am looking something like this and can't find.
[01:05:24] <chargen> let's see
[01:05:53] <kwladyka> Do you know any plugin works like that photo gallery?
[01:06:22] <Omar-> kwladyka http://www.1stwebdesigner.com/fresh-jquery-image-gallery-display-solutions/
[01:06:38] <Omar-> there are endless number of photo galleries
[01:08:07] <kwladyka> thx i will check. I read similar site with list of galleries but all worked much diffrent then what i need.
[01:11:40] <Unopoo> I use $.get() to make a ajax request, and it runs fine in chrome, but in firefox, every time after the $.get() is runnig, it skip the `succes` callback function, and refresh the page entirely
[01:11:40] <Unopoo> my code is like this:http://jsfiddle.net/2Ljqyt61/
[01:11:50] <Unopoo> plz, why is that happening?
[01:12:28] <Cork> Unopoo: refresh the page entirely sounds to me like your not stopping the original event
[01:12:43] <kwladyka> and i am afraid is the same situation, all this gallery are old and poor, many of them doesnt work
[01:13:02] <nrdb> I have a jtable where I want to decide on record by record basis if the (delete/edit) icons are 'active', can this be done?
[01:13:49] <Unopoo> Cork: but, in chrome is works!
[01:13:56] <Unopoo> same code
[01:14:06] <Cork> Unopoo: well can you make the fiddle complete?
[01:14:38] <IzaacJ> hey. I'm working on a Wordpress plugin, and I've tried to figure out how to make my jQuery conflict proof. As of now, hovering over Appearance does NOT render the popout menu if the plugin is activated. js is located here: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ff7d8306e7a342e01b02  the js in the plugin also breaks anything else that uses jQuery on the admin part
[01:20:56] <chargen> here's my first fiddle. I hope you get the point: http://jsfiddle.net/1qbeaL4x/
[01:21:49] <chargen> Let's see if I can add the images
[01:30:33] <multi_io> the JQuery selectors are implemented in Javascript, right?
[01:30:54] <multi_io> i.e. they're not using native browser APIs?
[01:45:43] <Cork> multi_io: no, they are native
[01:45:52] <Cork> $() is mainly document.querySelectorAll
[01:46:07] <Cork> (if you strictly talk about selectors that is)

[02:22:58] <phpcoder> hello everybody
[02:23:07] <Uhkis> hello!
[02:23:16] <phpcoder> how can i select a list of checkboxs that start with "DealBid0AdRegion"
[02:23:23] <phpcoder> the ID
[02:23:36] <phpcoder> the problem here is that i must to select
[02:23:49] <phpcoder> DealBid0AdRegion            DealBid1AdRegion        DealBid2AdRegion
[02:24:12] <Uhkis> how about using a class for those instead?
[02:24:32] <phpcoder> so basically i have to allow those kind of selectors...... ID that starts with those strings that have a custom number inside
[02:24:36] <phpcoder> hmm too difficult? ok
[02:25:04] <Uhkis> it's doable but class just seems way more sensible solution
[02:25:44] <phpcoder> Uhkis, something like $("div[class^='services'")
[02:25:47] <phpcoder> ?
[02:25:47] <bacobart> div[id^="DealBid"]
[02:26:05] <bacobart> or whatever element it is
[02:26:16] <Uhkis> yes
[02:26:41] <phpcoder> jk
[02:26:43] <phpcoder> k
[02:27:24] <Uhkis> that probably doesn't work with any ie
[02:33:42] <hrust> I have problems with initializing responsive extension for jquery datatables. I have included css and js responsive files, and added 'responsive : true' to options when initializing... what am i missing?
[02:34:16] <Uhkis> ?paste @ hrust
[02:34:16] <b-ot> hrust: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:44:01] <hrust> Uhkis works fine on jsfiddle
[02:44:19] <hrust> http://jsfiddle.net/famf73h1/
[02:44:51] <hrust> probably i have some css issue?
[02:45:49] <hrust> or maybe because i build html dynamically and when its done I initialize dataTable?
[02:47:56] <phpcoder> last thing guys
[02:48:00] <phpcoder> iif i have
[02:48:17] <phpcoder> <select class="aaa bbb2">
[02:48:36] <phpcoder> i have to do something like $("select[class^='bbb']")
[02:48:47] <phpcoder> the problem is that's does not work
[02:48:51] <phpcoder> if i add
[02:48:58] <phpcoder> [class^='aaa bbb'
[02:49:01] <phpcoder> it works!
[02:49:08] <hrust> $('select.bbb')
[02:49:25] <phpcoder> hrust, "that starts with"
[02:49:42] <phpcoder> hrust, it has "aaa bbb2"
[02:49:57] <phpcoder> i have to check if the select has a class that starts with "bbb"
[02:51:55] <hrust> http://api.jquery.com/attribute-starts-with-selector/
[02:52:55] <phpcoder> hrust, i know how it works the problem is that bbb is inside all the classes in the select
[02:55:33] <hrust> oh idk maybe try to use filter function
[02:56:24] <phpcoder> ok
[04:02:09] <ashka> hi, does the test function has access to the a variable at that point ? http://paste.awesom.eu/NnX8
[04:03:03] <Cork> ashka: yes
[04:52:02] <[Non]> http://jsbin.com/jeyukozaso/1/edit how can i fix that code?
[04:52:15] <[Non]> if you look up javascript code you can see the logic mistake
[04:52:28] <[Non]> and you will understand what im trying to do
[04:58:47] <[Non]> no one?
[05:09:21] <[Non]> is evdryone sleep? :D
[05:15:53] <BinaryKitten> [Non] what errors are you having. Which libraries are in use. Can you update with html
[05:31:16] <stangeland> Why will this select box not change color when i change it? http://jsfiddle.net/v7xxj7mj/4/
[05:31:26] <vulpes-> Hi all, I'm trying to do stuff when key are pressed but I'm getting an error when pressing left/right arrow. http://jsfiddle.net/w5ztLs7g/ $view is a global var (working in other functions)
[05:36:07] <BinaryKitten> stangeland - because browsers do not allow it?
[05:38:19] <BinaryKitten> option text is propagated through, not the actual option
[05:38:30] <BinaryKitten> stangeland - http://jsfiddle.net/v7xxj7mj/8/
[05:39:27] <Trisox> dont get looking real funny when ie 7 crashes on that ..
[05:39:48] <Trisox> styling normal select can give some problems
[05:41:22] <BinaryKitten> yep.
[05:41:27] <BinaryKitten> Trisox ltns
[05:41:53] <Trisox> slang indeed :D
[05:42:06] <BinaryKitten> slang?
[05:42:27] <Trisox> ltns = internet slang of was it for something ese
[05:42:43] <Trisox> long time no see ah
[05:42:49] <Trisox> lol yes long time :)
[05:43:09] <Trisox> how you been BinaryKitten ?
[05:43:14] <BinaryKitten> not too bad..
[05:43:17] <vulpes-> Never mind my question, i got it solved
[05:43:34] <Trisox> good to hear
[05:43:35] <BinaryKitten> vulpes- have a look at my Keyz extension
[05:43:44] <mbrzuzy> Would anyone be up for giving me some feeback on some JavaScript libs I wrote? :) They're not too complicated
[05:44:12] <BinaryKitten> vulpes- it's a little out of date and would love to update it .. but here it is: http://binarykitten.com/js/259-jquery-keyz-plugin.html
[05:44:16] <Trisox> BinaryKitten: doing any thing interessing lately?
[05:44:27] <BinaryKitten> Trisox - mostly unfun stuff
[05:44:28] <vulpes-> BinaryKitten: Thank you, having a look :]
[05:44:39] <Trisox> BinaryKitten: said to hear :(
[05:44:58] <BinaryKitten> mbrzuzy - try explaining what one is and how we can check it
[05:45:01] <Trisox> maintenance jobs ?
[05:45:49] <BinaryKitten> Trisox - yup. mostly fixing things that are no longer able to cope with the load that they should be able to
[05:46:07] <BinaryKitten> (code going from 200 entries to 3-4000 etc)
[05:46:34] <Trisox> ah damn that .... well every one would rather do greenfield project ;)
[05:47:13] <BinaryKitten> i'd just like chance to think on new things.. rather than patch existing
[05:47:20] <Trisox> BinaryKitten: any interesting technologies
[05:47:21] <BinaryKitten> though, different challenges etc
[05:47:34] <Trisox> true more fun if you ask me
[05:47:36] <BinaryKitten> define interesting
[05:48:17] <Trisox> BinaryKitten: dont know interesting for you
[05:49:12] <BinaryKitten> Trisox - not in coding..
[05:49:29] <BinaryKitten> Trisox - outside - working on a Pi-Nes
[05:49:43] <BinaryKitten> (Raspberry Pi based Nintendo Entertainment System)
[05:49:45] <Trisox> i have mainly working with angular gives you lot of headages but is fun and challenging
[05:49:49] <BinaryKitten> that's interesting
[05:49:54] <Trisox> cool :)
[05:52:27] <BinaryKitten> lunch break is almost over
[05:53:19] <Trisox> BinaryKitten: nice seeing you again  have a nice one
[05:53:22] <mbrzuzy> Sure.  Basically my company uses google maps api for store locator type functionality.  But that kind of functionality it's always hacked together with no convention.  So I created a more robust solution that they can use for different things.  http://hastebin.com/rowalakivo.js  I would love some feedback.  I'm bound to have made some stupid mistakes
[05:56:14] <usc911> there any way I can check a span for color:#00000; and bash !important before the ;
[05:57:36] <BillCriswell> usc911: Hmm... fun question but one I don't think you should need to ask.
[05:58:17] <BillCriswell> usc911: Is it inlined in the HTML you're working with and untouchable?
[06:00:07] <usc911> BillCriswell: yep, its being appended through tinyMCE and to get phantomjs to render a pdf it needs to include !important on the color property
[06:00:20] <BillCriswell> usc911: Ahh..
[06:01:14] <BillCriswell> usc911: In that case you can just look at the style attribute for it.
[06:01:54] <vulpes-> Is historyJS still the best way to handle urls for dynamic pages? have a photo gallery and want to keep it clean and have it get the direct selection to a photo from the url (rather not use #tags)
[06:02:39] <phpcoder> hello
[06:02:54] <phpcoder> i have a select i can select multiple options...then i do
[06:03:02] <phpcoder> $("#tab_1 select[class^='_services'] :selected")
[06:03:05] <phpcoder> it works correctly
[06:03:17] <phpcoder> but how can i get the list of the value of each elements i have selected?
[06:04:23] <usc911> BillCriswell: yeah looking in to it now
[06:05:22] <BillCriswell> I hate naming things.
[06:05:54] <BillCriswell> usc911: Basically, what's I'd do is $el.attr('style').split(';').map(function(css) { return css.trim(); });
[06:06:39] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: Hey, you around? I don't quite understand the jsbin you sent yesterday. I tried it out, but I think I'm missing the boat somewhere.
[06:07:07] <arschmitz> hi
[06:07:13] <BillCriswell> then loop through that and split on ':', trim both of those, then just check to see if [0] is "color" and [1].split(' ').slice(-1)[0] === "!important"
[06:07:48] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: ok so which part do you need help with?
[06:08:53] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: so I think I understand what the mobileinit function is doing, but I'm not sure. Here's the link if you don't have it anymore: http://jsbin.com/qokeje/4/
[06:09:11] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: thanks i was just about to ask for it
[06:09:30] <arschmitz> ok so let me talk you down through what its doing
[06:09:42] <phpcoder> ?
[06:10:05] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: my understanding is that first you look for some part of url loggedin and if it's true, remove the #start (disclaimer for me)
[06:10:21] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: on mobile init we wait until document ready ( so the page dom already exists )
[06:10:45] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: then yes check if the user is logged in already
[06:11:04] <arschmitz> however that logic works in your app basically plug it into that if
[06:11:43] <arschmitz> so realStart is your desired index page
[06:12:25] <arschmitz> no we dont want people to ever actually go to realStart
[06:12:30] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: ok, then we run the pagebeforechange if we're not logged in, and it checks if we're navigating to the realstart page, and if so, it sets the topage to the current url? Then removes #start and does something odd with the id, heh
[06:12:37] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: because thats a dummy page
[06:12:56] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: sorry I missed what you said I was just trying to sum up my understanding, I'll read now
[06:13:00] <BillCriswell> usc911: http://jsbin.com/qoguca/1/edit?js,output is what I was thinking
[06:13:26] <arschmitz> so if someone tries to go there we redirect them to start
[06:13:37] <arschmitz> but we also
[06:13:48] <arschmitz> remove the current start page
[06:13:54] <arschmitz> and rename realStart to start
[06:14:11] <cordovafan8> ok, what's with the data-url though?
[06:14:15] <arschmitz> so basicly start always contains the proper start page
[06:14:25] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: thats part of the jquery mobile history tracking
[06:14:32] <arschmitz> its the internal url of that page
[06:15:01] <cordovafan8> I'm just confused about what to put there, the id (start) or the html page? (index.html)
[06:15:08] <arschmitz> the html page
[06:15:14] <arschmitz> either would work
[06:15:23] <cordovafan8> ok, so that's sort of what I had going before, let me check again
[06:15:31] <arschmitz> but to keep a clean url just use the url instead of the id
[06:15:53] <usc911> BillCriswell: that great thanks, gives me a good pointer!
[06:15:54] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: the removeing and renaming is key here
[06:16:18] <arschmitz> because it makes sure to not ever actually have multiple pages to keep your history how you want it
[06:16:22] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: I remember not being able to see the #start at all initially, which was the point, so I wrapped some extra logic, which may have been the problem
[06:17:41] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: i just made one small change
[06:17:43] <arschmitz> http://jsbin.com/qokeje/5/edit
[06:17:44] <gnarf> fyi *.jquery.com is down for a little bit - upgrading the host it's running on - was getting a little slammed today
[06:18:07] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: i added a 3rd check to the conditional
[06:18:15] <cryptopsy> xelim: hey
[06:18:25] <cryptopsy> it was the god damn width: that was fucking with it
[06:18:26] <cordovafan8> right to see if it's empty
[06:18:42] <arschmitz> yup
[06:18:43] <cryptopsy> xelim: without width, float and block-inline work as they should
[06:18:50] <arschmitz> incase we already removed it
[06:19:46] <Omar-> hi cordovafan8 arschmitz
[06:20:02] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: just changed again slightly http://jsbin.com/qokeje/6/edit
[06:20:13] <arschmitz> because part of that needs to happen regardless of if it exists
[06:20:42] <cordovafan8> gotcha
[06:20:47] <cordovafan8> my one concern with this method
[06:20:55] <cordovafan8> is that I need to access #realstart sometimes
[06:21:03] <cordovafan8> so renaming the div might not be the best idea
[06:21:23] <cordovafan8> is that the only way to get around the history? Maybe I could rename #start instead?
[06:21:24] <arschmitz> why do you need access to it
[06:21:32] <arschmitz> and in what way?
[06:21:40] <arschmitz> i mean its still there it just has a different name?
[06:21:44] <cordovafan8> well I have a home button that goes to #home (that is my realstart)
[06:21:57] <arschmitz> right you would not change that
[06:22:06] <arschmitz> well really you want it now to just go to index.html
[06:22:12] <arschmitz> but either way will work still
[06:22:30] <arschmitz> because if you go to #home it will redirect to index.html
[06:22:33] <arschmitz> under the hood
[06:22:59] <arschmitz> and if you go to index.html it will always show the correct content ( either disclaimer or home depending on if they are logged in )
[06:23:24] <arschmitz> so basicly just always link to index.html
[06:23:34] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: and it will just always show the right content
[06:23:40] <xelim> cryptopsy: so everything works fine now ?
[06:23:43] <cordovafan8> haha, ok, let me finish it up here
[06:24:17] <cryptopsy> xelim: sorta ... centering is kinda screwed up in firefox
[06:24:27] <cryptopsy> xelim: can you try it on my website and take screenshoot?
[06:24:34] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: that snippit in the jsbin handles all the logic for you so in your app you dont need to worry about which thing you actually want to link to
[06:24:51] <xelim> cryptopsy: well FF needs a -moz prefix for transform
[06:24:58] <cryptopsy> xelim: i took out transform
[06:25:03] <cryptopsy> xelim: cpov.info
[06:25:12] <xelim> cryptopsy: ok will take a look
[06:25:14] <cryptopsy> and i need to find a way to control accordion's width
[06:27:02] <xelim> cryptopsy: so you need to make the accordion bigger ?
[06:27:45] <xelim> cryptopsy: like lets say width: 400px. is that right?
[06:29:05] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: so I need to change all my changepages from #realstart to #start correct? The id #realstart won't exist anymore :/
[06:29:20] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: no both will work
[06:29:24] <fbentz_> Hi all !
[06:29:26] <arschmitz> but i would recomend doing it anyway
[06:29:39] <cryptopsy> xelim: yes
[06:29:42] <cordovafan8> hrmm, let me paste what I put in my deviceready, sec
[06:29:50] <cryptopsy> xelim: because its contents has to wrap when i expand it
[06:31:53] <xelim> cryptopsy: <div class="container" style="position:fixed; left:50%; top:50%;width: 900px;">
[06:32:13] <cryptopsy> width breaks it, but am gonna try it again just incase
[06:32:14] <xelim> cryptopsy: <div class="accordion ui-accordion ui-widget ui-helper-reset" style="float:left;width:  400px;" role="tablist">
[06:32:47] <cryptopsy> xelim: just the menu needs to be fixed width, not the container
[06:33:26] <fbentz_> I have a question, is it possible to avoid that jquery.param replace /%20/g in + ?
[06:33:34] <xelim> cryptopsy: that should do the trick, but the content is not centered. you either have to put the transform back in or use something with margins
[06:34:12] <xelim> cryptopsy: well the container has to be big enough to hold the image and the accordion, so you need to set both
[06:34:34] <cryptopsy> the container isn't fixed width so it will hold it
[06:35:07] <xelim> cryptopsy: no it wont, it will go under the image.
[06:35:59] <xelim> cryptopsy: the only way of doing this is to use display: inline-block and white-space: nowrap on the container and sub-element
[06:36:02] <cryptopsy> i dont understand that
[06:36:11] <cryptopsy> can you give me the updated index.html ?
[06:36:20] <cryptopsy> its confusing for me to add all these lines ...
[06:36:22] <xelim> cryptopsy: but then you will have trouble centering it
[06:36:30] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: sorry it took so long, I added some context functions so you can see how it works: http://pastebin.com/jrtmMWyq
[06:36:54] <cryptopsy> xelim: the only definitive thing i'm sure of, was when i removed width, everything else we tried yesterday worked like it was supposed to
[06:37:10] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: looking
[06:37:39] <cordovafan8> the major difference is that I don't test location.href, because that's not the criteria I need to show the disclaimer
[06:37:42] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: why are you calling .off( "pagebeforechange" )
[06:37:47] <xelim> cryptopsy: but then we didnt have a bigger menu ... if the menu is bigger it won hold in the container ... i will create a fiddle... hold on
[06:37:59] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: oh I was worried I would rebind it again and again
[06:38:07] <cordovafan8> it's not bound anywhere else
[06:38:08] <arschmitz> no that only happens once
[06:38:16] <arschmitz> you dont need that
[06:38:34] <cordovafan8> ok. We had issues in the past with cordova and binding things repeatedly, so I was just being safe
[06:38:59] <cryptopsy> xelim: it will hold it for any fixed width because it will just expand vertically
[06:39:15] <xelim> cryptopsy: ok try it
[06:39:25] <cryptopsy> xelim: i just pushed a large paragraph
[06:39:47] <cryptopsy> its screwed up because accordion is not fixed width
[06:39:51] <cordovafan8> the problem I'm seeing is that when I click 'accept' on my disclaimer, which is supposed to go to #home via changepage, it goes nowhere because it can't find it I think
[06:39:57] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: the ui.toPAge = "#home" needs to be outside that if
[06:40:24] <arschmitz> that needs to happen no matter what
[06:40:52] <cordovafan8> oh duh
[06:40:56] <cordovafan8> copy failure
[06:41:40] <cryptopsy> xelim: of course has to be a "width" somewhere, but i dont think it should go on container, i think it should go on accordion
[06:41:56] <cryptopsy> xelim: did not see an option in the jqueryui API
[06:42:04] <cryptopsy> and width on it does not work
[06:43:00] <cryptopsy> or ... something has to accompany it in the style
[06:43:40] <cryptopsy> xelim: i put width on container too, it doesnt work
[06:44:42] <xelim> cryptopsy: http://jsfiddle.net/jr7nwkwq/
[06:45:49] <cryptopsy> trying those changes now ...
[06:46:20] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: sorry for the delay, apple is reviewing our app right now and I have to divide my attention. fixing now.
[06:46:22] <usc911> BillCriswell: Thanks again Bill, worked it out using https://gist.github.com/bmweeden/ed23cfb4b7777680fc1f
[06:47:14] <cryptopsy> xelim: cpov.info
[06:47:16] <BillCriswell> Sweet.
[06:47:18] <cryptopsy> you can see it not work
[06:48:15] <nunne> Just started out with jQuery. Can someone please tell me why this isn't working? $('#usr_name_' + usrid).html("hello");     ?? the div is created by code earlier and I can see if in javascript inspector.
[06:48:19] <xelim> cryptopsy: if you want the accordion to have width: 500px then set the container to 1000px;
[06:48:40] <cryptopsy> xelim: good catch
[06:49:15] <cryptopsy> xelim: say i want to shuffle images out of a folder, and each image is slightly different width but the same height, how will i handle that?
[06:49:21] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: no problem im working
[06:53:56] <nunne> nevermind. I'm a retard.. had # in the id declaration on the divs.
[06:54:51] <cryptopsy> xelim: i'm trying to set a height on the accordion so that it will expand only up to the same height as the image, i set 1000px for testing, but it only seems to expand about 300px
[06:55:56] <cryptopsy> xelim: i also used heightStyle: "fill"w
[07:00:47] <cryptopsy> xelim: i've tried this working configuration but didn't work for me: http://jsfiddle.net/arunpjohny/46E6y/
[07:00:56] <xelim> cryptopsy: why would you need to expand the accordion ?
[07:01:29] <cryptopsy> xelim: just want it to be a fixed height so that when i expand a menu entry, its the same height
[07:01:49] <cryptopsy> since it will start with the first option already openened on page load
[07:02:07] <cryptopsy> i just pushed some changes so you can see what i tried
[07:02:40] <xelim> cryptopsy: why not use overflow: scroll
[07:05:36] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: I think the div is still being removed too fast, if I click confirmdisclaimer now I get a blank screen.
[07:05:52] <cordovafan8> ie if I changepage to #start (#home for me) it is blank :x
[07:06:00] <cryptopsy> xelim: is that a jqueryui property or css?
[07:06:31] <arschmitz> cryptopsy: dont call dialog close and changepage
[07:06:37] <arschmitz> thats whats breaking it
[07:06:43] <cryptopsy> dont understand ...
[07:07:19] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: just go to #home there
[07:07:31] <xelim> cryptopsy: you could set it on the content container via css
[07:07:43] <cryptopsy> i am so confused
[07:07:49] <cordovafan8> yeah I removed the dialog close already since I thought that might be the issue
[07:08:21] <xelim> cryptopsy: http://jsfiddle.net/arunpjohny/46E6y/ in this example on section 3 the content is overflowing and a scroll bar is displayed
[07:08:37] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: oh and you have the id wrong
[07:08:42] <arschmitz> when you set ui.toPAge
[07:08:50] <arschmitz> it should be disclaimer-dialog
[07:08:53] <cryptopsy> the default version of the jquery accordion example has a fixed height, i dont know how they did that
[07:09:03] <arschmitz> not home
[07:09:26] <arschmitz> home is a dummy page you dont ever want to actually go there
[07:10:40] <cryptopsy> xelim: in your last exxample, can i put max-height on the accordion line?
[07:10:50] <cryptopsy> div id=accordion, that is
[07:11:17] <xelim> cryptopsy: yes, also take a look at this example: http://jqueryui.com/accordion/#fillspace
[07:11:31] <cryptopsy> xelim: it didn't work when i did it
[07:12:06] <cryptopsy> xelim: how do i get you the update i made on jsfiddle?
[07:13:21] <xelim> cryptopsy: update it and send me the link
[07:13:25] <cryptopsy> http://jsfiddle.net/46E6y/45
[07:18:11] <xelim> cryptopsy: http://jsfiddle.net/46E6y/46/
[07:19:01] <xelim> cryptopsy: you had a max-width set to #accordion element rather than .ui-accordion-content
[07:26:24] <cryptopsy> xelim: but setting it globlly like that will fix it for all accordions
[07:26:47] <cryptopsy> and i'm using class=accordion, not id=accordion
[07:27:11] <cryptopsy> so i want to set it on this line  0   <div class="accordion" style="float:left; width:500px; max-height:500px;">
[07:27:45] <xelim> cryptopsy: well use something more specific then ex: .container-1 .ui-accordion-content { max-width: 200px }
[07:28:31] <cryptopsy> that is certainly true, but is there no way to set it per line basis?
[07:28:41] <xelim> cryptopsy: just a suggestion, it's not good practice to have your styles inline
[07:28:55] <cryptopsy> how come? makes it easier to read and track
[07:29:12] <cryptopsy> eventually i have to integrate it to nodejs, and it will get really confusing if everything is piled in <head>
[07:29:23] <xelim> cryptopsy: not really, using external styles is a better practice
[07:29:32] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: So I removed the dialog('close'), but when I click the confirm disclaimer button (which has changepage to #home) I get a jqm error cannot call trigger_ on undefined (probably because #home doesn't exist anymore). If I change that changepage to go to disclaimer-dialog, it goes nowhere (stays on disclaimer)
[07:29:36] <delboy1978uk> what you guys trying to fix? looking at the fiddle
[07:29:50] <cryptopsy> xelim: but there will be many external styles , so i save that for colors not for behavior
[07:30:19] <cryptopsy> for example, when i rotate image, i have the web server push inline styles to adjust accordion width
[07:30:30] <xelim> cryptopsy: it was a suggestion,
[07:30:38] <cryptopsy> anyways, how can i do it inline?
[07:30:44] <gtristan> cryptopsy, generally UI are created with components which repeat themselves a lot, and composite objects which include many of the same component
[07:30:51] <delboy1978uk> what you trying to do cryptopsy?
[07:31:03] <gtristan> cryptopsy, using a separate css file allows you to say "All of my FooButtons should look like this"
[07:31:13] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: make accordion the same height as image, but in a proportional way since i plan to rotate image
[07:31:16] <cryptopsy> cpov.info for exaple
[07:31:16] <gtristan> instead of having a mess of scattered and inconsistent garbage :D
[07:31:17] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: can you paste update code you have changed to much at this point
[07:31:49] <cryptopsy> gtristan: this is true , but cannot have separate style for 100+ images
[07:31:54] <xelim> gtristan: exactly, thank you :)
[07:32:15] <cryptopsy> i am not in disagreement, i just don't see how it can be practical when i expand to multiple images
[07:32:30] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: sure, sorry. Hang on.
[07:33:39] <cryptopsy> the accordion should be always the same height as the image
[07:34:15] <gtristan> cryptopsy, I dont know accordians and what makes them so special, but if you have some kind of specific container which can have a variable amount of 'pages' or 'children', I'm not sure why each child should have separate style attributes
[07:34:32] <gtristan> if they absolutely must, then you probably want the JS attached to the container to set that up
[07:34:48] <gtristan> and have some kind of $(accordian).addImage () function
[07:35:10] <gtristan> or whatever the jquery API style is (we're in #jquery right ?)
[07:35:16] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: this seems to resize properly for each accordian, is this what you need? http://jsfiddle.net/46E6y/48/
[07:35:23] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: http://pastebin.com/qX5yWYVh
[07:36:22] <cordovafan8> I think it might be trying to go to disclaimer-dialog when I do my changepage to home in confirmdisclaimer, because the pagebeforechange will fire
[07:36:44] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: that should happen
[07:36:52] <arschmitz> the problem might be the index.html
[07:37:02] <arschmitz> can you just load the page and when the dialog is still open
[07:37:11] <arschmitz> look at what the data-url is set to
[07:37:22] <arschmitz> because thats what you need to set it to on line 7
[07:37:29] <arschmitz> oh wait i know
[07:37:31] <cordovafan8> ok, sec
[07:37:40] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: hold on better idea
[07:37:57] <cordovafan8> ok :D
[07:38:38] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: http://jsbin.com/qokeje/6/edit
[07:38:39] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: did that help?
[07:38:49] <arschmitz> then its always set right because it reads it
[07:39:15] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: ok I see, let me try
[07:41:21] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: cpov.info
[07:41:25] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: exactly the same behavior unfortunately. Let me try setting the data-url manually
[07:42:04] <ZionZee> anyone know how to do query autocomplete search script?
[07:42:08] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: its pretty hard to debug an app i cant see lol. but the concept works as shown by the jsbin
[07:42:10] <ZionZee> for django?
[07:42:43] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: THANKS FOR THAT YOU COULD HAVE SAID. I'M IN WORK HERE
[07:42:44] <arschmitz> cordovafan8: execpt i broke that bin at some point ha ha
[07:42:47] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: I know man, I'm sorry.
[07:43:09] <cordovafan8> thanks for the help. I at least got some ideas
[07:43:17] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: shes not nude ..
[07:43:20] <cryptopsy> sorry
[07:43:28] <delboy1978uk> didnt wait long enough lol
[07:43:36] <delboy1978uk> might check it later though ;-)
[07:43:43] <cryptopsy> anyways it doesnt work
[07:43:59] <delboy1978uk> wish someone would give me a site like that to work on haha
[07:44:31] <cordovafan8> arschmitz: I think I'll try to just work around this history issue, if I can trigger an extra history.back() on pagebeforechange or something
[07:45:44] <cryptopsy> anyways ... is there a jqueryui widget that's like a list that gives a popup which is set just a bit to the right of the index, but overlapping it
[07:46:25] <cryptopsy> like a menu but the popup always occur in the same location rather than below the menu entry
[07:46:47] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: if i were you i'd use bootstrap for all this kind of stuff
[07:47:00] <delboy1978uk> imho its way better than the jquery-ui stuff
[07:47:08] <delboy1978uk> and it still uses jquery
[07:47:16] <cryptopsy> i will check it out
[07:47:32] <cryptopsy> its mobile first, cool
[07:47:32] <delboy1978uk> http://getbootstrap.com/
[07:47:41] <delboy1978uk> yeah its freaking awesome
[07:47:43] <delboy1978uk> PLUS
[07:47:47] <cryptopsy> where's their demo page
[07:47:50] <delboy1978uk> search free bootstrap templates
[07:48:00] <delboy1978uk> theres tonnes of them
[07:48:09] <delboy1978uk> all really high quality
[07:48:09] <cryptopsy> npm can get it too, cool
[07:48:31] <cryptopsy> if i download it can i demo it?
[07:48:33] <delboy1978uk> ]trust me you wont build another site again without including this stuff once you start using it ;-)
[07:48:52] <gtristan> bootstrap++
[07:49:10] <cryptopsy> why's such a pain in the ass to demo it
[07:49:14] <delboy1978uk> what you mean demo it? you can see examples in the CSS, components, and Javascript links in the nav
[07:49:36] <cryptopsy> i just downloaded it and theres jut css fonts and js
[07:49:47] <delboy1978uk> yup
[07:49:49] <cryptopsy> where's some .html showing its features in action
[07:50:09] <cryptopsy> jqueryui has a demo page when you download it with all the widgets on one page
[07:50:12] <gtristan> cryptopsy, on the website linked above, there is a CSS section, a Components section and a Javascript section
[07:50:16] <delboy1978uk> try this for example http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#collapse
[07:50:25] <cryptopsy> there's a bootstraptour.com
[07:51:16] <delboy1978uk> bootstrap tour is a plugin built with vbootstrap, not bootstrap itself
[07:51:28] <gtristan> cryptopsy, also there are lots of very small plugins that blend well with bootstrap
[07:51:31] <delboy1978uk> i quite like it actually
[07:51:45] <gtristan> which means you can get some more functionality without the weight of huge libraries
[07:52:01] <gtristan> bootstrap-select is nice, the datepickers and timepickers for example
[07:52:29] <cryptopsy> its sing modal.js for its popups
[07:52:32] <cryptopsy> its using
[07:52:39] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: just include the css and js and you are good to go, just copy paste any markup from their site (which you will end up bookmarking, so you might as well do it now :-))
[07:53:02] <delboy1978uk> modal.js isnt required if you usef the full bootstrap.min.js
[07:53:16] <cryptopsy> so how do i get it to do what i asked?
[07:53:19] <delboy1978uk> but you can load components separately if you like i believe
[07:53:28] <delboy1978uk> what u asking?
[07:53:51] <gtristan> I think that's just how the git is setup, but maybe you can load parts of it
[07:53:56] <delboy1978uk> oh yeah images
[07:53:57] <cryptopsy> 15:45:44 < cryptopsy> anyways ... is there a jqueryui widget that's like a list that gives a popup which is set just a bit to the right of the index, but overlapping it
[07:54:00] <cryptopsy> 15:46:25 < cryptopsy> like a menu but the popup always occur in the same location rather than below the menu entry
[07:54:36] <delboy1978uk> you mean a tooltip or a popover? http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips  http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers
[07:54:37] <cryptopsy> and i still dont see a demo page using only bootstrap
[07:55:09] <cryptopsy> im looking at popover now
[07:55:13] <delboy1978uk> or a modal window? http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals
[07:55:17] <cryptopsy> i dont know ...
[07:55:21] <cryptopsy> what's with all these extra js
[07:55:26] <cryptopsy> you're saying i dont need them, but here its using them
[07:55:28] <delboy1978uk> ignore them
[07:55:37] <gtristan> how is http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers not a demo page using bootstrap ?
[07:55:45] <cryptopsy> gtristan: it says popover.js
[07:55:56] <cryptopsy> gtristan: the download didnt come with that
[07:56:03] <cryptopsy> only bootstrap.js and npm.js
[07:56:07] <cryptopsy> and the minified
[07:56:26] <gtristan> I dont understand why popover.js would be used
[07:56:32] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: look here, only one js file http://jsbin.com/tufumakefo/1/edit?html,output
[07:56:37] <cryptopsy> i dont understand it either
[07:56:40] <gtristan> I think you are looking at the git project and getting confused
[07:56:53] <cryptopsy> im looking t getbootstrap.com/javascript/#popovers
[07:57:03] <delboy1978uk> look at my jsbin
[07:57:11] <gtristan> cryptopsy, the git project is sanely organized, it's meant to be a bunch of separate sources which come together to create boostrap.js
[07:57:16] <delboy1978uk> only requires jquery, and bootstrap js and css
[07:57:31] <delboy1978uk> play around! everything on bootstraps website will work
[07:57:37] <gtristan> just because the developers keep their sources neat and separate, doesnt mean their sources are meant to be consumed one by one
[07:58:22] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: can i make a popup launch from inside another popup?
[07:58:31] <delboy1978uk> haha - pass!
[07:58:34] <cryptopsy> basically like a tree menu
[07:58:52] <gtristan> yes, interactive popovers are a go
[07:59:16] <cryptopsy> have you see the jqueryui menu, like that
[07:59:48] <delboy1978uk> also check http://speckyboy.com/2014/05/27/free-bootstrap-3-templates/
[08:00:34] <cryptopsy> this is overwhelming me considering its hard to paste
[08:00:43] <cryptopsy> because i have multiple copy buffers so its huge pain in my ass
[08:00:57] <cryptopsy> cuz firefox uses different copy buffer than X
[08:01:18] <cryptopsy> i guess ill look at template once this works
[08:14:12] <oste> $(‘.toggle:not(.off)’).click(function() { ...
[08:14:18] <oste> for some reason that does not work for me
[08:14:33] <oste> ie. if the element has the .off class it will still trigger the click event
[08:17:01] <arthurvr> Hi guys!
[08:17:06] <delboy1978uk> HI!
[08:17:14] <arthurvr> Hi delboy1978uk!
[08:17:24] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: do i have to use 'button' , can i just use divs?
[08:17:25] <delboy1978uk> :D
[08:18:01] <cryptopsy> since i'm abandoning jqueryui might as well look at other menu libs like backbonejs too
[08:18:04] <delboy1978uk> for a button? i usually use <a> tags with class="btn btn-danger" or whatever
[08:18:26] <delboy1978uk> trust me bootstrap is king!
[08:18:31] <cryptopsy> dont wanna waste hours attempting to build a menu only to find out it doesnt work quite like i suggest. better to see example first
[08:18:41] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: everyone claim their platform is king, u know? its hard to know who's full of shit
[08:18:42] <delboy1978uk> we,, jQuery is king! but bootstrap is the kings right hand man
[08:19:04] <cryptopsy> in #web people are talking shit about jquery
[08:19:19] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: now you've seen bootstrap you'll notice it in tonnes of sites
[08:19:29] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: who knows what shitty hacks they've made
[08:19:39] <delboy1978uk> lol
[08:19:40] <cryptopsy> i'm not that good to work it out painfully
[08:19:47] <cryptopsy> am just an amateur
[08:19:56] <multi_io> what would you use to mark elements (e.g. spans) contained in a container div as e.g. "textContent" or "imageContent"?
[08:19:57] <delboy1978uk> practice makes perfect :)
[08:20:09] <cryptopsy> show me a working hierarchical model
[08:20:10] <multi_io> was that comprehensible? :P
[08:20:20] <cryptopsy> tree, accordion, whatever
[08:20:23] <cryptopsy> 2d hierchical structure
[08:20:24] <delboy1978uk> multi_io: give themn a custom class?
[08:20:52] <shazam3r> how would I scroll down on a page if I hover over something that is on the lower end of the screen?
[08:20:54] <multi_io> delboy1978uk: yeah, I thought about that. is that a good idea? I mean if the class doesn't actually exist.
[08:21:13] <delboy1978uk> if it doesn't exist, all the better!
[08:21:54] <cryptopsy> this is more interesting http://jsfiddle.net/umutc1/eyf9q87c/
[08:22:04] <cryptopsy> can i download all of it with one click off jsfiddle?
[08:23:37] <delboy1978uk> wow thats awesome where did you find that?
[08:24:00] <cryptopsy> random google
[08:24:04] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: just copy the html and javascript code and css, sure
[08:24:14] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: does it support keys? like navigate it with arrow keys
[08:24:56] <shazam3r> any ideas on a scroll down on hover?
[08:25:03] <gtristan> cryptopsy, cute treeview, will be interesting to reorder it with drag and drop :)
[08:25:36] <cryptopsy> god damn bootply wont let u download unless you pay monthly fee
[08:26:21] <cryptopsy> what's difference between vbootstrap and bootstrap?
[08:27:16] <delboy1978uk> vbootstrap?
[08:27:53] <cryptopsy> someone said earlier ...
[08:28:04] <cryptopsy> looks like w3schools has lots of bootstrap examples
[08:28:11] <cryptopsy> this is what i was looking for
[08:28:25] <arthurvr> okay just don’t use w3schools guys
[08:28:30] <arthurvr> w3fools.com
[08:28:34] <cryptopsy> they're not very interesting
[08:28:38] <cryptopsy> but at least its soemthing
[08:28:45] <cryptopsy> i hope w3schools destroys the tech geeks
[08:28:57] <delboy1978uk> w3schools is for n00bs, to keep them in a state of stupidity
[08:29:09] <cryptopsy> ideally each js lib has its own perfectly written documentation, not soe long rant about web design philosophy WITH NO WORKING EXAMPLES
[08:29:09] <delboy1978uk> old deprecated info
[08:29:21] <delboy1978uk> eh?
[08:29:29] <cryptopsy> its still more productive than waste my time hack each js lib from the ground up only to find its limitation
[08:29:30] <arthurvr> not only deprecated info - even just incorrect info
[08:29:52] <cryptopsy> look how much time i wasted in here just with jqueryui accordion
[08:29:57] <cryptopsy> trying to set its width and height
[08:30:04] <cryptopsy> this happens every time with every lib
[08:35:56] <cryptopsy> i found a dope jqueryui menu
[08:36:12] <cryptopsy> http://cssmenumaker.com/menu/slabbed-accordion-menu#
[08:37:03] <cryptopsy> this is a great website; lot of example, and you can download 1 click
[08:37:56] <delboy1978uk> try http://www.bootbundle.com
[08:39:04] <cryptopsy> i guess 'overlapping vertical menu' is what best describe what im trying to build
[08:39:29] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: im looking at their tour
[08:39:45] <delboy1978uk> its just a collection of free stuff in one bundle
[08:39:49] <cryptopsy> dont see any menus
[08:39:55] <cryptopsy> gonna download it maybe theres a demo page
[08:40:00] <delboy1978uk> try one of the admin panels
[08:40:34] <cryptopsy> dont see any
[08:40:36] <delboy1978uk> try this: http://ironsummitmedia.github.io/startbootstrap-sb-admin-2/pages/index.html
[08:41:11] <delboy1978uk> multi-level-dropdown
[08:41:35] <cryptopsy> it doesn't overlap
[08:41:58] <cryptopsy> i want it to expand horizontally (not vertically) with overlapping instead of placing each list side by side
[08:42:03] <delboy1978uk> you got a screenshot or link of anything similar to what you want?
[08:42:06] <cryptopsy> thats a nice demo page though
[08:42:23] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: i cannot find a demo, but do you understand what i mean by overlapping?
[08:42:33] <cryptopsy> like how the bootstrap modal windows overlap ontop of your webpage
[08:42:36] <delboy1978uk> not really, thought you meant accordion
[08:43:25] <cryptopsy> http://cssmenumaker.com/menu/whiteout-flyout-menu
[08:43:39] <cryptopsy> like this, but have the boxes that expand horizontally overlap
[08:43:49] <cryptopsy> with maybe 10px shift to the right for each level
[08:44:20] <cryptopsy> using div mostly, dont like ul li
[08:44:42] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: why on earth not? they have their uses
[08:45:13] <cryptopsy> so i can control each level with a class
[08:45:26] <cryptopsy> i've done it before with li from scratch, it became messy
[08:45:27] <delboy1978uk> you can do that with any html element!
[08:46:38] <cryptopsy> does bootstrap support cookies for modal?
[08:46:57] <cryptopsy> imagine i have a menu with modal, and i want the menu they clicked on to be remebmered when they navigate away
[08:47:50] <delboy1978uk> its just javascript/jquery. anything i spossible
[08:48:20] <cryptopsy> the reason i brought up accordion in the first place, is because the top parent list should behave like a shuffle-able and sort-able list of news items
[08:48:33] <cryptopsy> but each news item have its own submenu
[08:48:59] <delboy1978uk> this any use? http://www.bootply.com/60932
[08:50:03] <cryptopsy> see how these menus give their submenus (like a box), on the side? i want the box to overlap the parent menu, with slight shift 10px http://www.designchemical.com/lab/demo-wordpress-jquery-vertical-mega-menu-plugin.html#
[08:51:18] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: that's cool, i would download it if i could. code looks siimple
[08:51:24] <delboy1978uk> wow check this http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-examples.php
[08:52:09] <cryptopsy> does bootstrap support cookies?
[08:52:28] <delboy1978uk> bootstrap calls jquery
[08:52:36] <delboy1978uk> does jquery support cookies?
[08:52:43] <delboy1978uk> jquery uses javascript
[08:52:49] <arthurvr> jQuery has nothing to do with cookies :)
[08:52:51] <delboy1978uk> does javascript support cookies?
[08:52:55] <delboy1978uk> yes
[08:53:14] <delboy1978uk> and theres the answer
[08:53:31] <cryptopsy> well no ... ther's easy way to store menu position and hard way write my own cookie
[08:53:53] <arthurvr> didn’t follow this hole discussion but probably worth it to use localstorage instead
[08:55:01] <Mastema> i have a fixed div at the top of my site with a height of 105px and a min-width of 800px. I want the horizontal scroll bar for the body to only scroll to the end of the navbar only. I got jquery going such that it horizontally scrolls, but it goes a bit too far with whitespace. http://jsfiddle.net/Celestia/h6c8rdrq/3/
[08:57:19] <delboy1978uk> heres a nice treeview http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0B30DGR
[08:57:21] <axilla> Mastema: i dont quite get what you're asking? you don't want horizonal scroll bar?
[08:58:05] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: any overlapping bootstrap menu out there?
[08:58:13] <delboy1978uk> looking :P
[08:58:27] <axilla> cryptopsy: make it overlap yourself.. adjust the positions
[08:58:36] <delboy1978uk> or that ^
[08:58:40] <Mastema> axilla: well, I'm not sure why it's not showing in jsfiddle, but I want the horizontal scroll bar that shows up when you're below 800px wide, to scroll along the fixed div until the end of it
[08:58:57] <robertmaxrees> Mastema btw you don't have jquery included in that fiddle
[08:59:05] <cryptopsy> axilla: don't know how
[08:59:08] <delboy1978uk> use jsbin.com
[08:59:12] <delboy1978uk> its better
[08:59:16] <arthurvr> it isn't
[08:59:16] <axilla> cryptopsy: good time to learn
[08:59:22] <arthurvr> it’s all personal opinion
[08:59:23] <cryptopsy> axilla: nah
[08:59:25] <axilla> don't know how is a very poor excuse
[08:59:33] <axilla> well then i can't be bothered to do it for you..
[08:59:42] <axilla> hell you're even asking for people to search for your code for you..
[08:59:44] <cryptopsy> there's like 100 libs, im not wasting my time learning till i see some half baked menu out there i can work upon
[08:59:50] <cryptopsy> can't lern em all
[08:59:56] <axilla> dont need to
[09:00:02] <axilla> you can build a menu in HTML5 and jquery
[09:00:07] <axilla> dont need a single lib to do it.
[09:00:20] <cryptopsy> axilla: its nice to have other features which the libs provide, like keybindings, cookies, sortable
[09:00:37] <axilla> its a menu
[09:00:41] <axilla> why would your menu be sortable
[09:00:54] <axilla> or have cookies or keybindings? those are all pretty simple to add in jquery
[09:00:59] <cryptopsy> for example, on my front page i want to display latest patches i write, so i want it to be sortable by date
[09:01:14] <cryptopsy> or sortable by topic, alternating one of the two
[09:01:30] <cryptopsy> its still a menu because each patch has its description
[09:02:04] <cryptopsy> keybinding make navigate the menu very simple. with jqueryui i had accordions in accordions and it let me navigate it by keybinding
[09:02:16] <cryptopsy> also its sortable
[09:02:42] <cryptopsy> but spent last 2 days hacking accordion width and height makes the future look grim and painful overlapping its position
[09:02:47] <axilla> well, i can't be bothered to do the work for you..
[09:02:50] <cryptopsy> so you suggest, i just do it myself .. well its pain in the ass
[09:02:52] <axilla> ask a question i'll answer though
[09:02:58] <axilla> its far form a pain in the ass
[09:03:01] <axilla> it takes a few hours tops
[09:03:05] <cryptopsy> bull fucking shit
[09:03:11] <cryptopsy> i was just doing that the past 3 days
[09:03:18] <cryptopsy> nothign behave like it supposed to
[09:03:26] <axilla> sounds like a problem with your code
[09:03:33] <cryptopsy> yes
[09:03:42] <robertmaxrees> Square peg, round hole maybe?
[09:03:45] <cryptopsy> but thats like saying, sound like a problem with policy when hitler exterminated the jews
[09:03:51] <axilla> not really
[09:03:55] <cryptopsy> yes.
[09:04:10] <cryptopsy> we looked up definition of float and inline and it didnt behavae like it supposed to until i removed width from jqueryui accordion
[09:04:21] <axilla> based on yoru name i hope you aren't writing bitcoin patches :(
[09:04:23] <cryptopsy> and tried literally every hack, only for me to discover this morning width was the problem
[09:04:24] <axilla> of some sort.
[09:04:32] <cryptopsy> :)
[09:04:41] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy i was late to the party - do you have an example of what you're looking to accomplish?
[09:04:51] <axilla> he wants someone to code him or find him a menu
[09:04:53] <axilla> he has no question.
[09:04:57] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: just a sideways expanding menu where each submenu overlaps the parent
[09:05:05] <cryptopsy> axilla: don't put words in my mouth
[09:05:07] <cryptopsy> pls
[09:05:18] <axilla> good luck
[09:05:30] <robertmaxrees> let's go fishin' then - where's this menu?
[09:05:46] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: there's one on my website cpov.info
[09:06:00] <robertmaxrees> yo i'm at work btw.
[09:06:05] <cryptopsy> she's not naked
[09:06:13] <robertmaxrees> scantily clad is still frowned upon.
[09:06:28] <axilla> i just build a HTML5/Jquery menu exactly like you want, but i can't be bothered to just hand out an entire stack of code when someone isn't even willing to do the slightest amount of work and learn how to you know.. actually write code.
[09:06:42] <cryptopsy> axilla: you are misinformed
[09:06:58] <cryptopsy> lets just play the benefit of the doubt. lets say i am totally lazy scumbag
[09:07:07] <cryptopsy> but i still spent 3 days fully working this, therefore i deserve it
[09:07:14] <Omar-> hi
[09:07:16] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy that's... not entirely accurate.
[09:07:23] <arthurvr> Hi Omar-!
[09:07:23] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: which part?
[09:07:34] <cryptopsy> am confused since having 2 discussions simultaneously
[09:07:36] <robertmaxrees> that you "deserve" free work.
[09:07:47] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: its not free if i tried 99 things and they all failed
[09:08:01] <robertmaxrees> it's not free to any of us, though :)
[09:08:09] <robertmaxrees> i can see why you're frustrated, though.
[09:08:13] <cryptopsy> the use of the word free is misleading though
[09:08:20] <cryptopsy> since its irc, everyone trade snippets
[09:08:24] <cryptopsy> but none get payed for it
[09:08:33] <cryptopsy> am not asking you give me the final product
[09:08:45] <cryptopsy> but axilla is under that impression
[09:08:45] <robertmaxrees> sure.  i'm only trying to help here.
[09:08:58] <cryptopsy> axilla thinks the final impression is overlappign boxes
[09:08:59] <delboy1978uk> back
[09:09:11] <cryptopsy> that's only a component of it
[09:09:19] <Omar-> hi arthurvr! :)
[09:09:20] <NoiseEee> cryptopsy: basically the theme of this channel is "i got this far (as you can see in my jsfiddle), but this part isnt working, i could use some help"
[09:09:23] <cryptopsy> considering height/width resize policy which was painful in jqueryui accordion
[09:09:28] <delboy1978uk> arthurvr: its much less quirky imho and easier to add libs
[09:09:57] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy i'd take a look at what NoiseEee just said.  we operate on a "learn how to fish" principle here.
[09:09:59] <arthurvr> well, that’s what I meant, delboy1978uk, It are all just personal opinions.
[09:10:09] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: its the same everywhere, i am not misinformed
[09:10:13] <arthurvr> delboy1978uk: people seem to forget that when discussion stuff
[09:10:22] <Mastema> axilla: http://jsfiddle.net/Celestia/h6c8rdrq/
[09:10:25] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: http://www.sitepoint.com/10-cool-jquery-flyout-menu-plugins/
[09:10:27] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: you see, you were away. someone suggest i abandon jqueryui
[09:10:34] <cryptopsy> so if i abandon it, i got nothing to fish for
[09:10:57] <Mastema> axilla i've tried several if statements based on width of banner, document and window to limit the scroll width... to get rid of whitespace but idk...
[09:11:12] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy how much experience do you have with frontend development?
[09:11:24] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: i'm a hobbyist, i don't make a living off it
[09:12:05] <axilla> cryptopsy: https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/f04457b62c1483b41fc8  here.. it doesn't take much to make a menu.. its mostly CSS/HTML! doesn't even require all that much jquery.. you should be able to figure it out from what i've given you
[09:12:23] <cryptopsy> axilla: i wrote a menu from scratch in pure css
[09:13:04] <axilla> Mastema: i still don't have scroll bars
[09:13:20] <cryptopsy> to say i should figure it out, is actually understatement. Here's jqueryui accordion trying to set height and width: cpov.info     if you check chat history you can see how painful it was
[09:13:35] <cryptopsy> yes in theory its easy use : height, width, float, inline
[09:13:52] <cryptopsy> in the end there's some transformation and lots of trial and error
[09:13:56] <delboy1978uk> axilla: what are those horrible <%  tags, ASP?
[09:14:02] <axilla> rails
[09:14:08] <delboy1978uk> oh ok
[09:14:10] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy what is your expectation right now?  what do expect us to do at this point?
[09:15:01] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: am just checking out other libs than jqueryui which provide some of the same features
[09:15:31] <cryptopsy> seems like its easier just to stick with jqueryui for now
[09:15:32] <axilla> they're a beautiful thing too :)
[09:15:40] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: guarantee you will get a lot better on frontend development if you stick to jquery with bootstrap
[09:15:41] <axilla> it allows you to have ruby code in your HTML
[09:15:43] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy you have tons of choices :)
[09:15:43] <cryptopsy> axilla: so you can handle a jqueryui question?
[09:16:04] <delboy1978uk> axilla: i prefer <?= myself ;-)
[09:16:09] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy this whole channel can help you with JQUI questions.
[09:16:11] <axilla> not sure what <?= is
[09:16:16] <delboy1978uk> PHP
[09:16:19] <axilla> oh dear god no
[09:16:30] <axilla> i'd rather gouge out my eyes than ever write another line of PHP
[09:16:42] <delboy1978uk> what version of PHP did you used to use?
[09:16:58] <delboy1978uk> it is waaaay better than it used to be
[09:17:05] <axilla> i switched from php to rails in rails 2 so probably like PHP5?
[09:17:10] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: ok ~ from my website, i want a submenu accordion for each parent. To fly out to the right and overlap it's parent accordion, but the same height as the parent (top to bottom)
[09:17:17] <delboy1978uk> yeah but early php5 sucked balls
[09:17:19] <axilla> you couldn't pay me to go back to php..
[09:17:22] <delboy1978uk> lol
[09:17:27] <axilla> the beauty of ruby syntax makes me happy
[09:17:32] <cryptopsy> php has some of the best documentation written
[09:17:32] <axilla> and my day job is all ruby/rails so :P
[09:17:41] <cryptopsy> very straight-to-the-point
[09:17:44] <delboy1978uk> im playing with python now
[09:17:50] <axilla> i want to right ruby like i want to write java
[09:17:54] <delboy1978uk> thinking django looks fun
[09:17:54] <axilla> err php*
[09:18:05] <axilla> i love python, but not for the web..
[09:18:06] <robertmaxrees> django was nice.  i miss it sometimes.
[09:18:18] <delboy1978uk> robertmaxrees: what do you use?
[09:18:19] <axilla> i'm learning Go and Elixer myself these days
[09:18:30] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: is that too broad?
[09:18:54] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy is what too broad?
[09:18:59] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: what i asked
[09:19:10] <axilla> cryptopsy: what I gave you will do just that
[09:19:20] <axilla> all you have to do is put the code for your accordians in there or whatever
[09:19:22] <robertmaxrees> i can't really look at your site on account of the lady on it ;)
[09:19:29] <cryptopsy> axilla: i have to adapt it to my jqui code
[09:19:35] <robertmaxrees> delboy1978uk i'm in a CF/Java shop right now.
[09:19:35] <axilla> that's not that difficult
[09:19:46] <axilla> its just an HTML layout and all the hover,etc is handled with CSS
[09:19:47] <robertmaxrees> hate the CF side.
[09:19:57] <axilla> oh dear.. i worked in a cold fusion shop
[09:20:07] * axilla pats robert on the back
[09:20:18] <axilla> it'll be ok man..
[09:20:18] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: i'll change the picture
[09:20:24] <robertmaxrees> axilla :) we're slowly moving away from it.  looking at alternatives.  we've moved the majority of our business logic out of it.
[09:20:33] <delboy1978uk> CF? cold... fusion?
[09:20:36] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:20:40] * delboy1978uk shudders
[09:20:50] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy you'll get a lot more help if you setup a fiddle or bin or something similar.
[09:20:55] <delboy1978uk> you dont work in jp morgan do you?
[09:20:55] <axilla> my first dev shop was cold fusion.. the ceo swore by it..
[09:21:01] <robertmaxrees> delboy1978uk nope.
[09:21:06] <axilla> "i've been developing code since Phil Katz" he use to sya
[09:21:16] <delboy1978uk> i was dissing flash the day macromedia released it
[09:21:16] <axilla> lol
[09:21:35] <robertmaxrees> cf is okay-ish these days as a templating language and cfscript looks more and more like JS every day, but it's still got some gross bits
[09:21:40] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: i changed the image
[09:21:42] <axilla> cryptopsy: you're not asking a question about a problem, you're asking for someone to show you how to do the entire problem.
[09:22:00] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy do you have a fiddle or bin instead?  that's be ideal.  then we could play around with it a lot easier.
[09:22:04] <cryptopsy> axilla: ok ~ how do i align accordion to the right of the image, regardless of image size?
[09:22:04] <axilla> cryptopsy: most people here want you to try to do it and then come and say, "hey I am having issues with X in this instance.. its doing this, but what I want is this."
[09:22:22] <axilla> you should resize the image to fit your view
[09:22:26] <axilla> CSS
[09:22:36] <cryptopsy> why would i resize the image and lose image quality?
[09:22:47] <axilla> you don't lose image quality lol
[09:22:51] <axilla> its the same image
[09:22:56] <axilla> just sized to fit via css
[09:22:56] <cryptopsy> it will shrink and get distorted
[09:23:01] <axilla> it doesn't physically resize the image
[09:23:11] <cryptopsy> now this is confusing
[09:23:21] <cryptopsy> resize image doesnt physically resize the image
[09:23:24] <cryptopsy> that's what you just said
[09:23:26] <axilla> i'm not sure exactly what your asking
[09:23:30] <delboy1978uk> if you have bootstrap on it now there is a responsive image class
[09:23:35] <cryptopsy> axilla: are you looking at my page?
[09:23:38] <axilla> yes, that's what I said.. you're not resizing it with imagemagik or photoshop
[09:23:42] <axilla> you're resizing it in CSS
[09:23:44] <delboy1978uk> your image can auto-groovify
[09:23:46] <axilla> so if I have an 800x800 image
[09:23:53] <axilla> and i make it display at 100x100
[09:23:59] <cryptopsy> axilla: see how the menu is below the image? that's not supposed to happen
[09:24:04] <axilla> the image itself is not down sampled to 100x100 its still 800x800
[09:24:04] <delboy1978uk> then it'll be smaller
[09:24:13] <axilla> let me look at your site one sec
[09:24:19] <delboy1978uk> be careful;
[09:24:21] <delboy1978uk> nsfw
[09:24:23] <cryptopsy> i changed it
[09:24:27] <cryptopsy> its a black image
[09:24:31] <cryptopsy> its not the NON-NUDE girl
[09:24:36] <axilla> whats the url?
[09:24:37] <delboy1978uk> lol
[09:24:39] <axilla> i work from home
[09:24:40] <cryptopsy> cpov.info
[09:24:42] <axilla> its always sfw
[09:25:03] <cryptopsy> see how the menu is below the black image? if i change the image, it will be to the right like it supposed to
[09:25:06] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy some of us are at offices where that sort of thing isn't really appreciated :)
[09:25:13] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: i understand
[09:25:19] <axilla> is the image and according in seperate divs?
[09:25:32] <cryptopsy> axilla: yes, and they are in a container which centers them
[09:25:35] <delboy1978uk> yes i had to close my windows pdq
[09:25:42] <delboy1978uk> pretty damned quick
[09:25:47] <axilla> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2716955/css-layout-aligning-two-divs-side-by-side
[09:25:52] <axilla> that's css
[09:25:59] <axilla> float left.
[09:26:31] <arthurvr> cryptopsy: before digging into debugging on that site, you might want to fix the 404’s
[09:26:47] <cryptopsy> axilla: you know what's interesting? when i set width on accordion, it breaks it if the width is greater than the container width (1000=container, 500=accordion, but image >500 in this case)
[09:26:49] <arthurvr> cryptopsy: might directly be your problem :)
[09:27:04] <cryptopsy> arthurvr: nah
[09:27:16] <axilla> of course it does
[09:27:18] <cryptopsy> yes ...
[09:27:21] <axilla> your container is a fixed width
[09:27:22] <robertmaxrees> 404's and js errors are always relevant.
[09:27:27] <cryptopsy> so accordion is not relative to the image
[09:27:30] <cryptopsy> that's the problem
[09:27:38] <cryptopsy> without container fixed width it doesn't work
[09:27:41] <cryptopsy> see chat history
[09:27:45] <cryptopsy> its 2 day discussion
[09:28:00] <axilla> i would suggest going back and refreshing your HTML/CSS skills
[09:28:08] <axilla> codeschool is a great place to do that
[09:28:08] <cryptopsy> we tried various variants with block-inline and float
[09:28:21] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: overflow: hidden; stops overflowing stuff bursting out, hiding it instead. overflow: auto; contains it all too
[09:28:22] <cryptopsy> what you see here is the result of 100 failed hacks
[09:28:35] <cryptopsy> its so easy to talk shit and say oh go check ur css handbook
[09:28:51] <delboy1978uk> its also easy to try our suggestions ;-)
[09:29:02] <cryptopsy> and label my as a lazy scumbag asking for free code, i guess because i dont wanna implement every fool's solution from scratch
[09:29:06] <delboy1978uk> we all learn this way
[09:29:48] <delboy1978uk> i like being dug up in irc, usually means i'm about to learn something
[09:30:11] <cryptopsy> only thing that's left to learn is jqueryui 's sourcecode
[09:30:32] <axilla> cryptopsy: most of your issue here is not related to jquery at all..
[09:30:38] <axilla> its your CSS/HTML
[09:30:53] <cryptopsy> if float behaved as it's definition states , then fixed width container would not be necessary, and this is jqui's fault
[09:31:05] <cryptopsy> also block-inline
[09:31:12] <rmill> wat
[09:31:29] <cryptopsy> fixed width on container was forced otherwise accordion doesn't place to the side of the image!
[09:31:39] <delboy1978uk> float will burst out of a div and overflow. use CSS rule overflow: auto; to contain it
[09:31:42] <axilla> i'm not labeling you anything, but the problems you have aren't related to jquery, and i'm honestly trying to tell you where to look to fix it.
[09:31:54] <delboy1978uk> ^
[09:31:57] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: it doesnt need fixed width, in theory
[09:32:04] <cryptopsy> because i wanted to set fixed width on accordion
[09:32:07] <cryptopsy> but this breaks float!
[09:32:10] <delboy1978uk> try taking it out then
[09:32:15] <delboy1978uk> and add the overflow rule
[09:32:21] <cryptopsy> well F*** me then, 2 steps forward 1 step back!
[09:32:22] <cryptopsy> but here we go
[09:32:26] <delboy1978uk> haha
[09:32:29] <cryptopsy> taking it out so you can understand it better
[09:32:30] <axilla> that's development
[09:32:32] <delboy1978uk> welcome to development
[09:32:36] <cryptopsy> welcome to 6 hours ago
[09:32:38] <cryptopsy> here we go
[09:32:39] <axilla> i literally fail all day sometimes on a few lines of code
[09:32:40] <delboy1978uk> hahaha
[09:32:44] <axilla> and i've been doing it for decades
[09:32:45] <cryptopsy> i'm pulling up my pants and socks now,
[09:32:52] <cryptopsy> i'm taking my belt off, bout to remove fixed width
[09:33:06] <delboy1978uk> pulling up your pants? told you guys his site was nsfw lmao ;-)
[09:33:06] <axilla> sometimes i fail and start over.. and try something completely different
[09:33:24] <cryptopsy> axilla: its ok
[09:33:26] <cryptopsy> i made a backup
[09:33:35] <cryptopsy> so you can have fun unfucking the stupid jqui behavior like i did
[09:33:45] <axilla> i dont use jqui
[09:33:48] <axilla> to much..
[09:33:48] <delboy1978uk> always make backups
[09:33:58] <axilla> its pretty heavy
[09:34:04] <delboy1978uk> better still, make a git repository!
[09:34:10] <cryptopsy> here u go
[09:34:12] <cryptopsy> cpov.info
[09:34:18] <cryptopsy> everything css is set to definition standard
[09:34:19] <delboy1978uk> mind you, i think thats for another day
[09:34:55] <cryptopsy> jqui accordion is fixed width like i want, resize your window and the menu is placed under the image. Here's what i see:
[09:35:18] <cryptopsy> http://i.imgur.com/R7dtVeb.png
[09:35:20] <robertmaxrees> your page is invalid btw.
[09:35:27] <arthurvr> ya wrong doctype
[09:35:35] <robertmaxrees> and it needs to be the very first thing.
[09:35:42] <arthurvr> too
[09:35:47] <robertmaxrees> <!doctype html> - use just htat.
[09:35:57] <cryptopsy> ok, thanks for that
[09:36:13] <cryptopsy> notice how even thogh the menu and image both fit, it is placed under the image
[09:36:17] <cryptopsy> see my screenshot
[09:36:34] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy fix the doctype first.  that can make browsers do really weird things.
[09:36:40] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: its fixed
[09:36:50] <robertmaxrees> before the comments, yo
[09:36:54] <cryptopsy> ah ok
[09:37:09] <cryptopsy> that would be a hilarious bug
[09:37:14] <cryptopsy> fixed
[09:37:58] <cryptopsy> in fullscreen, the menu is to the right like it should be. In minimized (but not so small that the menu and image don't fit), it is placed under the image!
[09:38:13] <cryptopsy> even if it was too small, it still should NOT be under the image
[09:38:29] <cryptopsy> fixed width container fixes that, but its bad hack that breaks other functionality
[09:40:18] <robertmaxrees> something isn't adding up here.
[09:40:24] <robertmaxrees> are you just trying to center some content on the page?
[09:40:36] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: menu and image should be centered
[09:40:50] <cryptopsy> or ... accordion and image
[09:41:11] <delboy1978uk> the div or the text? div, margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto; or content, text-align: center;
[09:41:33] <cryptopsy> i dont understand
[09:41:47] <delboy1978uk> is it a div youre trying to center?
[09:41:48] <cryptopsy> the image and the accordion should be side by side, and centered
[09:41:53] <delboy1978uk> or the div's content
[09:41:55] <delboy1978uk> >?
[09:41:58] <robertmaxrees> you're making this a lot harder than it needs to be.  one sec.
[09:42:07] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: both, i guess. i don't see how they differ
[09:42:29] <cryptopsy> its just supposed to look like an addressbook. a physical paper addressbook
[09:42:34] <cryptopsy> and you center the book on your desk
[09:42:50] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/ can you copy your basic markup and css to here?
[09:43:24] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: yea let me try that
[09:44:43] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: http://jsbin.com/cojeyejeve/1/edit?html,css,output
[09:45:02] <delboy1978uk> thats the difference i mean
[09:45:38] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: i updated the urls to point to the files on my site, dont know what i did wrong but it didnt work
[09:45:42] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[09:45:46] <robertmaxrees> i'll show you.
[09:46:25] <cryptopsy> http://jsfiddle.net/zuknopgz/1/
[09:46:37] <delboy1978uk> cryptopsy: did you check my paste?
[09:46:49] <cryptopsy> http://jsfiddle.net/zuknopgz/2
[09:46:55] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: no, im trying to get this jsfiddle up
[09:47:28] <cryptopsy> http://jsfiddle.net/zuknopgz/3
[09:47:36] <delboy1978uk> ok but take a look
[09:48:01] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy that's not the right way to use jsfiddle.  look at delboy1978uk while i show you something.
[09:48:58] <cryptopsy> delboy1978uk: dont understand what im looking at
[09:49:02] <cryptopsy> seems irrelevant
[09:49:06] <axilla> lol
[09:49:50] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/27ufbpkg/1/
[09:49:54] <axilla> then you don't understand html/css at all and really really need to do what i said and learn it.
[09:50:00] <cryptopsy> axilla: you don't understand jqui
[09:50:05] <axilla> before you even try to learn jquery..
[09:50:14] <axilla> actually i'm fluent as it comes in jquery so yea i understand it very well
[09:50:16] <cryptopsy> learn some jqui 101 before chiming in
[09:50:22] <axilla> lol...
[09:50:44] <robertmaxrees> not perfect, but it should get the idea across
[09:51:03] <pantsofchocolate> this is the most hostile ive seen this room
[09:51:14] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: am sorry, but it doesn't, because i've seen this before
[09:51:19] <axilla> you're telling me to leanr to code? hahaha ok, i'm done here.. in the time you're trying to align some divs dude i've written a full export of assets from my app to box.. including javascript/html/ruby backend shit and more..
[09:51:26] <delboy1978uk> i find it hard to believe that someone can be an expert in jquery without understanding basic HTML and CSS
[09:51:34] <axilla> exactly
[09:51:36] <cryptopsy> axilla: i don't really care what i'm telling you, because it doesn't advanced my interests in any way
[09:51:59] <axilla> actually if you just learned HTML/CSS it would advance your interests in every way
[09:52:06] <axilla> but i digress. i got no more energy for you.
[09:52:10] <cryptopsy> thank god
[09:52:27] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: you see, it display differently in jsfiddle ...
[09:52:28] <axilla> you can learn HTML/CSS in 2-3 days tops
[09:52:37] <axilla> if you set out and do it.
[09:52:41] <cryptopsy> useless advice
[09:52:45] <axilla> .. yep
[09:52:49] <cryptopsy> yeap, so what you want?
[09:53:20] <axilla> good luck in yoru coding career sir.. you're going to need it.. learn to take advice from people who know far more than you.
[09:53:39] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: in chat history, there's a guy xe..something, provide that example this morning, 8hour ago, and we came to the conclusion to use fixed width container
[09:54:05] <robertmaxrees> cryptopsy right - this uses a fixed width container.  do you need a fluid width container?
[09:54:14] <cryptopsy> xelim that's his name
[09:54:56] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: i guess so, since i want to rotate images, and it wouldnt' be practical to have a different style for each image, to adjust accordion's width so it places to the right of every image
[09:55:17] <cryptopsy> axilla: i wont need your blessing in my career. You wanna know why
[09:55:29] <cryptopsy> because this is a hobby, my career is medicine, and i'm doin' alright
[09:55:39] <axilla> i hope to god you're never my doctor.
[09:55:44] <delboy1978uk> lol
[09:55:47] <pantsofchocolate> heh
[09:55:50] <delboy1978uk> right guys i'm off!
[09:55:54] <cryptopsy> give you the benefit of the doubt to make it easier to fight you, lets say im totally incompetent web dev
[09:55:58] <cryptopsy> its still fine
[09:56:05] <cryptopsy> since its hobby :)
[09:56:34] <delboy1978uk> good luck cryptopsy! check out a sitepoint tutorial for html/css! one evening of that should spare you hours of farting around hacking stuff to work :-)
[09:57:06] <arthurvr> Let’s stop that discussion here and get back to the point guys
[09:57:10] <cryptopsy> if i develop a heroin addiction tomorrow and work on jqui while getting my D sucked by a cheap H* it would not matter fighting you on irc
[09:57:17] <cryptopsy> since i don't get payed for it
[09:57:27] <cryptopsy> but i guess you do, so don't impose that restriction on me
[09:57:45] <delboy1978uk> throw new OffTopicException('this is meant to be #jquery',301);
[09:58:07] <delboy1978uk> adios amigos!
[09:58:18] <cryptopsy> you can master (bate) your css tutorial up and down my pole and it would be totally irrelevant to the forced hack of fixed width for jqui accordion
[09:58:28] <cryptopsy> davlefou: adios
[10:02:37] <robertmaxrees> welp
[10:02:51] <cryptopsy> since it takes between 6 hours and 1 days to come to half working setup, everytime someone make a suggestion it involves me revert back to a change i already tried. So changing between inline-block and float, involves lot of pasting
[10:03:17] <cryptopsy> so before i do that, why did you suggest display: block-inline over float?
[10:03:19] <robertmaxrees> Let's move forward :) is my fix not good because it's a fixed-width container?
[10:03:24] <robertmaxrees> *inline-block
[10:03:39] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: fixed width is desired on accordion only
[10:03:47] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so let's work on that part next.
[10:03:57] <cryptopsy> can we stay with float:left ?
[10:04:03] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[10:04:15] <robertmaxrees> float removes things from document flow.  inline-block keeps document flow and gives us widths/heights.
[10:04:24] <cryptopsy> because your example use block-inline but my page uses float, so i would have to change that first
[10:04:33] <robertmaxrees> let's get a working example first.
[10:04:39] <cryptopsy> ok, so you want me to go back to block-inline?
[10:04:42] <robertmaxrees> so you can fully understand the ideas here.
[10:04:54] <robertmaxrees> i want you do not edit your page and stick with the fiddle :)_
[10:05:00] <robertmaxrees> s/do/to
[10:05:03] <cryptopsy> each concept has a short description, what i don't understand is not the concept, but the strage behavior
[10:05:22] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: the fiddle behave differently than my page
[10:05:30] <cryptopsy> because the strange behavior manifest when resizing
[10:05:33] <cryptopsy> but i can't resize the fiddle
[10:05:44] <robertmaxrees> sure you can.
[10:05:56] <cryptopsy> it just develops a scrollbar when i 'resize' it
[10:06:23] <cryptopsy> or, if i could download the fiddle, that would be great
[10:06:31] <cryptopsy> so we can work in the fiddle then download it to test it in the browser
[10:09:32] <robertmaxrees> you can get the full-screen result if you want.
[10:09:39] <robertmaxrees> under the "Share" menu
[10:09:49] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: i've merged your inline-block in my page
[10:10:07] <cryptopsy> it behaves the same except the menu is not bottom and to the side of the image
[10:10:10] <t4nk284> has someone 5 minutes time for a new jqerry coder ? it cant take long :)
[10:10:56] <arthurvr> t4nk284: you’re welcome
[10:11:41] <pantsofchocolate> hey guys kind of a weird question, whats the best way to show a full value of a textfield on hover? like kinda like when you hover overan image and the title pops up sorry i dunno if i went through i dropped
[10:11:42] <t4nk284> thank you
[10:16:12] <robertmaxrees> busy busy busy day
[10:18:18] <cryptopsy> robertmaxrees: the problem with height/width in container line is that affects the centering
[10:18:39] <cryptopsy> but accordion can only set its height/width in the container surrounding it
[10:18:50] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[10:19:14] <cryptopsy> both inline and float work as expected when its outside the container
[10:24:23] <TeddyMurray> http://jsbin.com/hemisokera/1/
[10:24:35] <TeddyMurray> any ideas why it's not finding the child element?
[10:25:02] <robertmaxrees> .children() goes one level.
[10:25:05] <robertmaxrees> try .find()
[10:25:09] <TeddyMurray> ty
[10:25:25] <robertmaxrees> also, try .prop() instead of .attr()
[10:25:44] <TeddyMurray> find worked, why prop instead of attr?
[10:26:25] <robertmaxrees> long story short, one edits the DOM node, the other edits the markup.  not a huge difference most of the time, but there are some situations where i can be very impactful.
[10:26:35] <robertmaxrees> forms, for instance.  lots of reading available on it.
[10:27:12] <TeddyMurray> i see, not sure what markup is but i will look it up
[10:27:17] <robertmaxrees> html.
[10:28:15] <t4nk284> Hi, is someone familiar with the rocksolid slider  ? seen here http://demo.rocksolidthemes.com/contao/tao/
[10:28:52] <robertmaxrees> t4nk284 just ask your question :)
[10:30:36] <t4nk284> i need to handle the text in the slides with jqerry, to inneWrap  <spans> around the text and i only figuret out how to handle the first slide
[10:30:49] <robertmaxrees> can you show us in a fiddle?
[10:30:58] <cryptopsy> I have an image and jqui accordion that i want to center on the page vertically and horizontally. I don't want it to change in any way, just to be centered. You can see here http://cpov.info . I have a line "container" which is immediatly followed by </div> which i attempted to center with. I placed the </div> right after because this line centers it incorrectly; it alterst he behavior of accordion.
[10:32:00] <t4nk284> ive never used fiddle before sorry and ive no idea to get all these in the fillde. i need some events or so to make my code running on every slide
[10:32:14] <cryptopsy> t4nk284: i know your pain
[10:32:36] <robertmaxrees> t4nk284 it's pretty simple :) copy your html and js into the fields marked for them
[10:32:46] <robertmaxrees> just need a minimal example.
[10:35:14] <t4nk284> ok, heres the link http://www.vorau.at/ my js only works on the first slide
[10:35:33] <robertmaxrees> where is your JS?
[10:36:07] <robertmaxrees> i assume script.js - what line?
[10:36:12] <arthurvr> script.js
[10:36:13] <arthurvr> last lines
[10:36:14] <arthurvr> :-)
[10:36:24] <t4nk284> last lines ;)
[10:36:43] <robertmaxrees> doesn't .wrapInner() only work on the first element?
[10:36:50] <t4nk284> just found that snipped from an former collegue but ive no idea how he handles the events
[10:37:08] <arthurvr> I don’t think so - might be wrong
[10:37:17] <arthurvr> `api wrapinner
[10:37:17] <b-ot> arthurvr: .wrapInner(): Wrap an HTML structure around the content of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrapInner/
[10:37:23] <t4nk284> here it works fine http://www.daseisenberg.at/de/
[10:38:27] <t4nk284> no idea how he did that, the customer handles the slider and i ve to make it for up top n slides
[10:38:58] <arthurvr> might be stupid question, but don’t you use some kind of templating engine? might as well do it there
[10:39:12] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:39:23] <robertmaxrees> if it HAS to be in the JS, edit the contents of the slides BEFORE the init.
[10:40:18] <t4nk284> you mean to change the slider template ?
[10:41:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah - have that include the tag instead.
[10:41:14] <t4nk284> and handle Js there ?
[10:41:29] <robertmaxrees> have the template include the spans instead of the the javascript.
[10:42:13] <t4nk284> thats impossible, the text comes as html from the tinymce
[10:42:21] <robertmaxrees> aaaah.
[10:42:36] <t4nk284> then ive to manupulate the tinymce template ?
[10:45:19] <sardok> Hi everyone, how can i select an item from bootstrap dropdown by using jquery (bootstrap's dropdown documented here: http://getbootstrap.com/components/#btn-dropdowns) thanks.
[10:45:42] <springirl> hi I'm appending some html to a fancybox popup
[10:46:19] <robertmaxrees> sardok $('.dropdown-menu').find('li') ?
[10:46:44] <springirl> and I have a form there when a link is clicked it's submitted I have $(this).closest('form').submit() in the onclick attribute it works on firefox but it doesn't work on chrome
[10:46:47] <springirl> any idea
[10:49:40] <robertmaxrees> springirl don't use onclick=
[10:50:04] <springirl> so the element is appended dynamically
[10:50:15] <t4nk284> thank you for your help, i try to maniplate the template to do what i want =) know i know that isnt the right way he did that
[10:50:20] <robertmaxrees> that's fine - use the delegated syntax of .on()
[10:50:20] <springirl> so the element doesn't exist when the page is loaded
[10:50:24] <springirl> ok
[10:50:28] <springirl> thank you
[10:50:33] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event'
[10:50:37] <t4nk284> now*
[10:50:50] <robertmaxrees> woops - $('parent').on('event', 'child', function() {});
[10:50:58] <robertmaxrees> check out the docs for .on() for more info.
[10:52:26] <t0astt> If I want to filter for a table row that has a "data-id" value of, 5, for example, I would do something like: var row = $('#question-table').filter('[data-id="5"]'); correct?
[10:52:53] <robertmaxrees> tr[data-id="5"]
[10:52:57] <robertmaxrees> wait.
[10:53:08] <robertmaxrees> no - $('#question-table tr').filter('[data-id="5"]');
[10:54:00] <sardok> robertmaxress: i am able to find the li but i cant set it.
[10:54:10] <robertmaxrees> sardok "set it"?
[10:54:36] <sardok> it is basically dropdown menu, when you click an option that menu, it is set
[10:54:44] <robertmaxrees> .click() it?
[10:54:45] <robertmaxrees> brb
[10:54:48] <t0astt> robertmaxrees: Ok, that is working now. And if I wanted to replace the text within a td inside that tr with a class of "question-text", I would do something like this? row.find("td.question-text").html().replace("test");
[10:55:30] <davlefou> cryptopsy, adios?
[10:56:45] <axilla> hey all i have a dynatree of folders i'm pulling down from box.  When I try and push a child node to a hidden field so I can post the data as params and I select both the parent and child the child node isn't getting pushed along with the parent.  I can select other parents + a child(without the parent selected) and i get all the keys.. only when selecting both a parent and its child does the parent over right the child in the .push htt
[10:57:12] <axilla> right = write
[10:57:27] <axilla> the child pushes if i select it by itself.. as well
[10:57:31] <axilla> a bit miffed.
[10:58:51] <t0astt> robertmaxrees: nvm, got it! had to change up my .find() selector
[10:59:14] <axilla> ahh that wonderful feeling of success :)
[10:59:51] <cryptopsy> davlefou: wrong person
[11:00:18] <arthurvr> cryptopsy: davlefou: lol :)
[11:03:50] <cryptopsy> can accordion be animated to autoatically expand each entry every 200ms ?
[11:07:11] <robertmaxrees> each one in turn?  sure.
[11:07:47] <txt23> Hey guys. How do I disable select2 dropdown for mobile and tabets?
[11:08:04] <robertmaxrees> t0astt sorry was a way for a sec.  glad you got it.
[11:08:17] <hrumph> hi
[11:10:44] <hrumph> http://jsfiddle.net/7k932m7d/
[11:10:44] <hrumph> hi
[11:10:57] <robertmaxrees> hello
[11:11:05] <hrumph> i can't get my jquery to work..i called the html  function to set some html
[11:11:14] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to set some data attributes?
[11:11:18] <hrumph> then inside that fragment i want to set some more html
[11:11:24] <arthurvr> also, jQuery isn’t included in the fiddle
[11:11:42] <hrumph> arthurvr, its just a cut and paste from my code
[11:11:53] <hrumph> i can't seem to combine fragments
[11:11:55] <arthurvr> hrumph: k. Just wanted to make sure you know
[11:12:04] <hrumph> i have one fragment which i can put in my DOM
[11:12:34] <hrumph> then within that fragment I just added there is an element with id "tbody"  (forgive this name it's just for testing purposes)
[11:12:50] <hrumph> i can't set the html for "tbody" presumably because its in the fragment I just added
[11:12:52] <robertmaxrees> hrumph it's hard to visualize - can you give us what you have?
[11:12:58] <robertmaxrees> example markup i mean.
[11:13:19] <hrumph> ok i'll try to step it out
[11:15:07] <hrumph> i have a div with id "listdata". the outer and inner fragments come from an ajax call and they are in a json array....i fetch them fine...The outer fragment will look something like "<table><head>wefwef</head><tbody id="tbody></tbody></table>
[11:15:35] <hrumph> there will be nothing inside of the <tbody> tags
[11:15:44] <hlvwrk> he who uses tbody tags
[11:15:44] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle?
[11:15:47] <hlvwrk> should die!
[11:16:01] <NoiseEee> and you mean <thead> and a <tr> there hrumph?
[11:16:10] <hrumph> so then the inner html will then get placed inside the tbody tags
[11:16:38] <hrumph> yes head should say <thead> and there is some content inside the <thead> tags
[11:16:52] <hrumph> there's no content inside the <tbody> tags because that's where innerhtml goes
[11:16:58] <NoiseEee> ok sounds good
[11:17:03] <NoiseEee> #goForIt
[11:17:05] <hrumph> so i insert one fragment then i want to insert into the gragment i just inserted
[11:17:28] <hrumph> but i doesn't seem to want to acknowledge the fragment I just inserted while i'm still in the handler
[11:17:33] <robertmaxrees> you have to select the new fragment.
[11:17:57] <platzhirsch> Is there a selector to select elements by their value?
[11:18:09] <platzhirsch> like ".span[value="content of span"]"
[11:18:17] <robertmaxrees> :contents()
[11:18:20] <robertmaxrees> or .filter() for it.
[11:18:29] <robertmaxrees> hrumph append to the fragment before you append everything to the document.
[11:18:45] <hrumph> robertmaxrees, how do i append to the fragment first?
[11:19:09] <robertmaxrees> $myFragment.append($somethingElse)
[11:19:32] <robertmaxrees> if it's just a string, $(myFragmentString).append(someOtherFragmentStringThing)(
[11:19:59] <hrumph> robertmaxrees, it is a string but I have to treat it like html and i'd be inserting somewhere inside the string
[11:20:02] <NoiseEee> hrumph: perhaps if you jsfiddle'd some real data, or what you call "fragment" etc
[11:20:10] <NoiseEee> hrumph: its time to work with some concrete examples
[11:20:11] <robertmaxrees> hrumph yeah - so just $(myString)
[11:20:39] <hrumph> robertmaxrees, so the $ turns into a real dom element?
[11:20:48] <robertmaxrees> into a jquery object, yes.
[11:20:51] <robertmaxrees> $(myString)
[11:20:57] <axilla> $ is a short hand for jQuery(
[11:20:58] <hrumph> ok that's interesting
[11:21:10] <hrumph> ok i'll see what i can do...
[11:21:40] <axilla> so instead of putting jQuery('element').on('click', function() {}); you can put $('element).on(etc...
[11:22:04] <robertmaxrees> i think he was more confused about being able to create fragments by passing them to $()
[11:22:58] <axilla> anyone wanna attempt to assist with this weird bug here https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/cafdc259fd969786f008
[11:23:11] <axilla> the .push will not push a child node if the parent node is selected
[11:23:13] <robertmaxrees> hrumph http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/019jryzc/
[11:24:20] <robertmaxrees> axilla looks like a problem with dynatree maybe?
[11:24:29] <axilla> possibly?
[11:24:32] <axilla> bit miffed on this one
[11:24:40] <robertmaxrees> hard to know without seeing an actual working example.
[11:25:10] <robertmaxrees> and without knowing what getSelectedNodes() is doing.
[11:25:37] <robertmaxrees> also just use an array literal instead of new Array(); - no need for the extra overhead.
[11:30:37] <sacho> var ar = []; and var ar = new Array(); are functionally identical
[11:31:02] <sacho> as 11.1.4 states
[11:32:39] <robertmaxrees> new Array(); creates an object wrapper that you absolutely don't need.  the literal should be plenty.
[11:32:54] <arthurvr> ya ^
[11:38:06] <Primero> when I create a modal, if I delete html, and I want create another modal, the jquery object I need destroy it or the memory is released when I delete the html?
[11:41:23] <robertmaxrees> Primero how are you deleting it?
[11:41:37] <Primero> innerHTML=""
[11:41:40] <robertmaxrees> because it shouldn't matter.
[11:42:18] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it gets released.
[11:43:18] <Primero> thanks
[11:43:19] <robertmaxrees> oh i see what you're saying.
[11:43:24] <robertmaxrees> it may or may not get released.
[11:43:42] <robertmaxrees> .innerHTML = "" may or may not work for your purposes, but it shouldn't matter.
[11:45:17] <Primero> what its the correct way, I create a modal, add textbox, panels, etc. how can delete all children without store the inventory of objects?
[11:45:43] <robertmaxrees> are you having performance problems?
[11:45:57] <robertmaxrees> generally you'd use .remove() on a selector.
[11:47:04] <Primero> no, im  writing the web version of my language for software projects
[11:47:43] <Primero> thanks
[11:48:02] <Primero> i will search selector
[11:50:30] <uber66> hi all, I need some help trying to compile a custom jquery using grunt
[11:50:33] <spizzle_sraz> anyone know how to retain my hover even when hover over text in this link -> http://new.pagesandchapters.org/get-involved/
[11:51:49] <jphase> spizzle_sraz: stick your title inside your gi_actions div
[11:52:42] <uber66> I only want $.get and $.when().done functions and their depencies.
[11:52:48] <spizzle_sraz> thanks jphase
[11:52:50] <spizzle_sraz> that workd
[11:52:57] <jphase> np
[11:53:17] <uber66> I'm in Gruntfile.js under removeWith, but I'm not sure what to type
[11:53:24] <NoiseEee> pretty sure thats not an option uber66
[11:53:47] <robertmaxrees> you could do just $.get() and $.when() with their dependencies, but that's going to be quite a bit.
[11:54:21] <NoiseEee> i thought jquery used to offer custom a-la-carte builds
[11:54:27] <uber66> I want to exclude all modules that aren't relevant
[11:54:37] <arthurvr> You can do that indeed
[11:54:51] <hrumph> robertmaxrees, i'm trying to do what you say with var fullFragment = $('#tbody', outerFragment).append(innerFragment) but it doesn't seem to want to work
[11:55:09] <robertmaxrees> show me, hrumph
[11:55:18] <hrumph> it has to be the child with id #tdbody of outerFragment
[11:55:31] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I thought you were just feeling sad but that's the actual nick.
[11:55:46] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell hahahahaha
[11:55:51] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[11:56:03] <hrumph> wait a minute...i may have screwed something up...
[11:58:16] <hrumph> robertmaxrees, see http://jsfiddle.net/mykqom2u/
[12:00:00] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mykqom2u/1/
[12:00:01] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[12:02:26] <hrumph> robertmaxrees, it replaces thead for some reason
[12:03:01] <robertmaxrees> it's time for a more fleshed out example of your code.
[12:03:12] <robertmaxrees> 'cause i'm flying blind at this point.
[12:03:27] <hrumph> robbyoconnor, it may be some bad html in my outerFragment
[12:03:37] <robertmaxrees> bad autocomplete
[12:03:45] <hrumph> robertmaxrees, it may be some bad html in my outerfragment...i'll see
[12:07:01] <NoiseEee> hrumph: for the umpteenth time... paste real/better data in your examples.  otherwise, good luck, you have enough to go with i think :)
[12:07:09] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:07:16] <robertmaxrees> that's why i finally said it.
[12:08:56] <springirl> hey I added the on click event to the afterShow callback still only works on ff and not on chrome
[12:09:09] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ springirl
[12:09:09] <b-ot> springirl: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:09:28] <springirl> in chrome console I can find Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token }
[12:09:35] <springirl> but can't find it
[12:09:38] <springirl> ok just 1 min
[12:10:56] <springirl> http://jsfiddle.net/s6kk4018/
[12:11:16] <robertmaxrees> not seeing the bad code in here.
[12:11:38] <springirl> I can't find the problem either that error is not showing in ff
[12:11:56] <springirl> may be I should clear the console and try again it seems like a cache thing
[12:11:57] <robertmaxrees> what line is chrome complaining about?
[12:12:02] <springirl> 2
[12:12:09] <springirl> where nothing in there
[12:12:10] <robertmaxrees> and don't use inline js on stuff.
[12:12:12] <robertmaxrees> that's bad bad bad.
[12:12:13] <springirl> it's inline
[12:12:17] <springirl> ok
[12:15:54] <igcewieling1> Can anyone give me some insight of the differences between .load and .attr('src'
[12:16:13] <robertmaxrees> .attr() is setting an attribute on an element.
[12:16:38] <robertmaxrees> .loat() calls the server for data.
[12:17:04] <igcewieling1> for images those two things appear to be the same thing.
[12:17:16] <robertmaxrees> two different intents.
[12:17:40] <igcewieling1> I'll go with plan B.  Thanks,
[12:17:47] <robertmaxrees> use .prop('src' btw
[12:18:05] <igcewieling1> neither help me.
[12:18:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:18:19] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to do here?
[12:19:13] <igcewieling1> I am trying to replace an ajax loader <img> with a different image using JS.   The correct solution, of course, is to have two img elements and show/hide as needed instead of putting the loader.gif into the original single img elemeent.
[12:19:38] <robertmaxrees> or create the new img tag when needed.
[12:19:54] <robertmaxrees> if there's some mitigating factor that doesn't let you do it server-side
[12:21:54] <igcewieling1> This is one of those "it would be nice as long as I don't have to spend hours on it" (which I would because I'm too much of n00b when it comes to JS)
[12:22:27] <robertmaxrees> if you have jquery available, creating the image tag is pretty trivial.
[12:22:50] <igcewieling1> indeed, dealing with the callback hell of making it all work right is not.
[12:23:25] <igcewieling1> especially if the image is already in the cache.
[12:23:46] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're having, then?
[12:23:47] <igcewieling1> re .load() and img "It doesn't fire correctly in WebKit if the image src is set to the same src as before"
[12:23:55] <robertmaxrees> you mean the load event?
[12:24:31] <igcewieling1> $('#call_detail_ingress_stats').load('https://bob.yigc.net/pcaps/sm_gui_ajax_pcap.php?module=stats&timestamp=' + $('#call_detail_timestamp').text() + '&callid=' + $('#call_detail_callid_ingress').text());
[12:24:46] <robertmaxrees> use .prop() for that instea.d
[12:24:52] <robertmaxrees> you might be confusing the two different .load()s
[12:25:50] <igcewieling1> robertmaxrees: It is all working, except for the eye candy when an image is redered.   I simply wanted a nice indication to the user.
[12:26:13] <igcewieling1> I'll use prop('src' and move on.
[12:30:19] <marc_v92> Okay, I'm going crazy here. I've got this code: http://dpaste.com/2DBPHRJ
[12:30:29] <marc_v92> The console.log() fires, so I know it's hitting the function.
[12:30:33] <marc_v92> The form still posts
[12:30:46] <robertmaxrees> e.stopImmediatePropagation(); - try that instead.
[12:30:59] <robertmaxrees> if it still breaks, something is binding to it and ruining your day.
[12:31:08] <robertmaxrees> or you're not selecting the actual form.
[12:31:43] <marc_v92> robertmaxrees: That seems to work. Any idea why it might be happening?
[12:31:50] <robertmaxrees> what seems to work?
[12:32:03] <marc_v92> stopImmediatePropagation() stops the form from submitting.
[12:32:24] <robertmaxrees> there's likely a delegated listener somewhere else that's listening for the submit event.
[12:32:30] <robertmaxrees> or something similar is going on.
[12:53:13] <axilla> robertmaxrees: figured out the issue.. i had a flag set to stoponparents when getting selected nodes.. so if you ever use dynatree and need parent + child node when using getselectednodes make sure its set to false :)
[12:58:25] <Mastema> axilla: I finally fixed it... i changed my fix div to absolute, so horizontal scrolling worked fine, and then used jquery and a z-index to keep it at the top like if it were fixed.
[12:58:57] <Mastema> i don't know why the horizontal bar wouldn't show up in jsfiddle =/
[13:04:16] <axilla> nice :)
[13:10:27] <Unode> hi all. Could someone clarify what is the difference of using the success callback from $.post or the .done() callback from the response object?
[13:11:10] <Unode> is one preferred over the other or do they serve different purposes?
[13:11:46] <arthurvr> Unode: right from the api site:
[13:11:54] <arthurvr> ”An alternative construct to the success callback option, the .done() method replaces the deprecated jqXHR.success() method. ”
[13:12:31] <Unode> arthurvr, that doesn't answer my question... Does it mean that the success callback is then redundant?
[13:13:29] <Unode> and sorry if I sound offensive, I read that line before but was not clear about it.
[13:13:36] <arthurvr> Unode: right from the jQuery source code: ”jqXHR.success = jqXHR.done;”
[13:13:43] <arthurvr> so I think they’re exactly the same
[13:14:06] <Unode> arthurvr, that's jqXHR.success, I'm talking about $.post(..., success)
[13:14:34] <arthurvr> $.post is just a shorthand for $.ajax, which actually returns an jqXHR.
[13:14:59] <arthurvr> they’re actually just equivalent
[13:15:05] <arthurvr> but I’d reccomend using .done()
[13:15:10] <Unode> sorry I think I'm not making myself clear. Let me link the code that is generating the confusion.
[13:15:38] <arthurvr> I’m afk for a while, sorry :(
[13:16:04] <Unode> Here: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/#jqxhr-object the example shows alert("success") and alert("second success").
[13:16:26] <Unode> arthurvr, thanks for your time and recommendation
[13:16:43] <arthurvr>  that’s because they do the same, and you can have multiple
[13:16:48] <arthurvr> but really have to leave no
[13:16:52] <arthurvr> ~now
[13:21:20] <Unode> arthurvr, thanks
[13:31:08] <cryptopsy> 	I have an image and jqui accordion that i want to center on the page vertically and horizontally. I don't want it to change in any way, just to be centered. You can see here http://cpov.info . I have a line "container" which is immediatly followed by </div> which i attempted to center with. I placed the </div> right after because this line centers it incorrectly; it alterst he behavior of accordion.
[13:39:39] <dot> hello, is there any good way to detect control +v or cmd + v paste to focus paste target area?
[13:40:23] <tw2113> you could perhaps track key codes on keydown and focus when the order is right
[13:41:07] <dot> yes i was trying this, but not sure if this will still work. Now If i click on target area and do paste it works but I am not sure if'll handle same event with focus on paste ?
[13:42:52] <dot> tw2113: http://pastebin.com/mTcwnmvH
[13:42:55] <dot> i did it this way
[13:43:01] <dot> but it does not start the upload process
[13:43:09] <dot> but it detect copy paste
[13:43:20] <dot> if I alert data that i pasted it show up
[13:44:53] <tw2113> *shrug* i was just throwing the inital thought out there
[13:45:09] <tw2113> not sure paste is a valid dom event
[13:45:13] <tw2113> but i could be wrong
[13:45:59] <dot> well i think it works in safari, chrome ie except firefox
[13:46:14] <dot> the only problem is how to trigger focus or click so it starts
[13:46:17] <dot> uploading
[13:46:30] <tw2113> dunno about that part at all
[13:49:43] <NoiseEee> copying and pasting is fairly unreliable iirc
[13:50:13] <NoiseEee> im pretty sure there's a reason that 'simple' task doesn't work in Google Docs for example
[13:50:17] <dot> well i have some users who likes to paste screenshots
[13:50:27] <NoiseEee> fair enough, just don't rely on JS to do that for you
[13:50:27] <NoiseEee> :)
[13:52:09] <paul_irish> hiya

[13:52:36] <dot> NoiseEee: :)
[13:52:39] <paul_irish> if we end up in matchesSelector from inside of our touchmove....
[13:52:43] <paul_irish> oh no.
[13:52:59] <paul_irish> oh no.
[13:53:29] <paul_irish>  a.rl = function(b) {           return b.qu.is(":visible") || b.Ts.is(":visible")       };
[13:54:18] <paul_irish> okay new question.
[13:54:27] <paul_irish> is the behavior of elem.is() technically sizzle or jquery?
[13:56:43] <dot> NoiseEee: http://pastebin.com/nXUM6JiE
[13:56:47] <dot> this is how i handle it now
[14:05:44] <BillCriswell> paul_irish: Hmmm... think it's jQuery. https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/0ea8c32863af31fb5cfc184e8d513bbae35583e8/src/traversing/findFilter.js#L83 think this is where it is?
[14:06:25] <paul_irish> BillCriswell: agree
[14:06:32] <paul_irish> thanks for the check
[14:06:47] <BillCriswell> No problemooooo
[14:07:10] <cjohnson> I imagine it's both right. it's jquery applying a sizzle selector to see if it matches or not
[14:07:28] <BillCriswell> I think that's the first time I found something in jQuery's source code without getting frustrated and quitting haha.
[14:09:23] <BillCriswell> Later everyone.
[14:10:18] <Velveeta> damnit, i missed bill by 1 minute
[14:10:21] <Velveeta> way to go, me
[14:12:25] <Velveeta> 80 degrees in austin... in january... #inclementweather
[14:18:14] <t0astt> Is there any way to reoder/sort a table WITHOUT using a plugin? I found the DataTable plugin (which I will use for a larger, more advanced table later), but I have a smaller table that just needs to be reordered/sorted in an AJAX callback
[14:18:35] <NoiseEee> i suppose you could have your backend sort it
[14:18:51] <NoiseEee> but i think most people expect a very quick sortable table by clicking on a column
[14:18:53] <t0astt> Only problem then is I have to return the whole table through AJAX, which could get hairy
[14:19:00] <NoiseEee> t0astt: whats your objection?
[14:19:05] <NoiseEee> to using a plugin that is
[14:19:09] <Expel> Hey, why doesn't this want to work? http://pastebin.com/nycyDFKy
[14:19:59] <t0astt> NoiseEee: I mean... I guess I don't really have a valid objection aside from having to rewrite a crapload of dynamic code for a small table
[14:20:10] <t0astt> *not intended to be sarcastic*
[14:20:55] <NoiseEee> what would you have to rewrite though?
[14:21:16] <NoiseEee> from what I understand, $('#myTable').DataTable(); yeah?
[14:21:20] <t0astt> Actually, now that I'm looking closer at DataTables, I may not need to rewrite anything...
[14:21:29] <t0astt> ugh, call me dumb
[14:21:39] <NoiseEee> nah thats paying work
[14:21:41] <NoiseEee> :P
[14:23:11] <[Non]> css
[14:23:15] <t0astt> Man, I wish I wasn't a student lol. I have so many fun coding projects I want to do, but schoolwork gets in the way so much :P
[14:23:28] <[Non]> http://www.jmd.im/ what was that content transition effect?
[14:23:30] <[Non]> what they called?
[14:23:49] <[Non]> coming from bottom before ends one
[14:24:23] <Velveeta> t0astt: that excuse isn't likely to change once you're out of school :D i have so many fun coding projects i want to do, but workwork gets in the way so much :P
[14:25:12] <Velveeta> [non]: parallax?
[14:25:39] <[Non]> i think not parallax im talking about the content effects
[14:25:58] <Velveeta> which specific content effect?
[14:25:59] <[Non]> if you slowly scroll down you see that second content coming behind
[14:26:17] <[Non]> think like z-index
[14:26:26] <[Non]> just slowly scroll down maybe you will understand me
[14:26:32] <Velveeta> that effect is called parallax scrolling
[14:26:52] <[Non]> isnt parallax scrolling on his photo*
[14:27:07] <Velveeta> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax_scrolling -- "Parallax scrolling is a special scrolling technique in computer graphics, wherein background images move by the camera slower than foreground images, creating an illusion of depth in a 2D video game and adding to the immersion."
[14:27:37] <[Non]> oh okay
[14:27:59] <Velveeta> and there's a section on that page for parallax scrolling in web design, to make it a little more context-relevant
[14:28:02] <Velveeta> relavent?
[14:28:10] <Velveeta> nah, relevant
[14:28:39] <[Non]> i was thinking about do parallax scrolling from the scratch and from myself
[14:42:13] <cryptopsy> can you center my content without breaking it? cpov.info
[15:11:52] <cliffer> how can i prevent clicks being registered from child elements except class 'bedrohungen'? i currently have this but it does not stops clicks being registered: http://pastebin.com/TADkWJm6
[15:12:33] <cliffer> argh, all clicks within bedrohungen should be prevented... not the other way round
[15:17:05] <kevireilly> cliffer: hmm seems like a jsfiddle may be more appropriate, but one approach might be using `not` http://api.jquery.com/not/
[15:17:56] <kevireilly> cliffer: though you are explicitly binding click handlers to all children of .bedrohungen, so, remove the `children` in between to not do that
[15:18:13] <cliffer> kevireilly: thx, but i want to include all elemts with class bedrohungen not exclude a specific one
[15:18:46] <cliffer> kevireilly: i have to bind click handles to all childrens to call stopPropagation()
[15:18:56] <kevireilly> cliffer: each children is reducing the options. For a more global approach, $('.bedrohungen').on('click', function(e){});
[15:19:48] <cliffer> kevireilly: for the moment, i solved it using an "if" to determine if it should stop propagating
[15:19:59] <cliffer> but this is not elegant
[15:31:43] <Mastema> I'm trying to get my absolute div to stay positioned at bottom of window where it's visible through jquery. It's working as long as I don't resize my window. I need my var top_dis to be recalculated on resize() correctly based on the new window width and height.http://jsfiddle.net/Celestia/thjj6wzq/
[15:32:10] <Mastema> I can't seem to calculate it correctly x.x...
[15:43:02] <kevireilly> Mastema: just out of curiosity, position fixed is intentionally being ignored as an option?
[15:43:40] <Mastema> kevireilly: yes i'm intentionally ignoring it because I want horizontal navigation to work normally.
[15:44:27] <kevireilly> Mastema: how so? You can determine and set a width also
[15:45:47] <Mastema> kevireilly, my layout only works so well to a minimum width at the moment.  If the window goes below that width, I want the scroll bar be able to scroll along those bars as well.
[15:45:52] <Mastema> if they are fixed it doesn't do that.
[15:46:48] <Mastema> I got it working for the top navigation bar, but i haven't been able to get it to work for the bottom one...
[15:47:24] <kevireilly> Mastema: hrm I think it behaves how you desire with a set width, but I guess it is neither here nor there on the original question
[15:48:11] <Mastema> yeah, well I don't want a set width. I want it to resize to a certain degree.  I just need to calculate the distance from the top of the viewport.
[15:48:20] <Mastema> but im not familiar with jquery at all x.x
[15:51:46] <kevireilly> Mastema: I may be mistaken, but I think this is an example of what I was talking about mixed with your requirements http://jsfiddle.net/thjj6wzq/1/
[15:53:15] <kevireilly> though I should've probably cached $('#bottomNavBar') to a variable http://jsfiddle.net/thjj6wzq/2/
[15:57:33] <Mastema> the annoying thing is the offset() function sets things in a += fashion it seems.
[16:49:41] <OnceMe> I'm trying to get a token from value and I use selector ID token to select it and get value
[16:50:04] <OnceMe> however my token is "y+ipWEqMy4A60ZVytyjcB8Qqkky8W7eC0Bo7PUB1EmI=" and I get value such as this from it: y ipWEqMy4A60ZVytyjcB8Qqkky8W7eC0Bo7PUB1EmI=
[16:50:19] <OnceMe> code: var token = $(".token").attr('value');
[16:50:21] <OnceMe> any ideas?
[16:54:23] <OnceMe> actually problem is when I pass it via ajax like this: data: "token="+token,
[16:54:25] <OnceMe> what to do?
[16:57:00] <OnceMe> ???
[17:21:47] <cryptopsy> jquery is broken because it can't make this accordion fill its height, which is supposed to be the size of the image next to it, see cpov.info

[19:20:11] <andry_yosua> hi
[19:20:48] <andry_yosua> i'd like to show jquery ui bug.. can i explain it here?
[19:22:03] <andry_yosua> i'd like to show jquery ui bug.. it's about resizable with option containment and (ghost or helper) are active. can i explain it here?
[19:22:03] <robertmaxrees> you'll have more luck filing a bug on github
[19:22:12] <andry_yosua> i'd like to ask about jquery ui bug.. it's about resizable with option containment and (ghost or helper) are active. can i explain it here?
[19:22:24] <andry_yosua> ok then
[19:22:26] <andry_yosua> :D
[19:22:43] <Primero> yes, explain me
[19:23:28] <Primero> robert say you the correct place, but if you want, explain it here
[19:24:29] <robertmaxrees> you could also head to #jquery-dev
[19:24:37] <robertmaxrees> but we don't file bugs or anything here.
[19:25:42] <andry_yosua> sorry for my english.. i'm not native speaker
[19:26:06] <robertmaxrees> do you need help with something?  or did you find a bug with the jquery ui library
[19:26:07] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:26:29] <andry_yosua> find a bug
[19:26:53] <andry_yosua> but i think you should see it first
[19:27:07] <robertmaxrees> err, ok
[19:27:08] <andry_yosua> it might be not a bug according to people here
[19:27:18] <coby> Hey guys. Anyone had issues with boostrap mobile dropdowns getting stuck open?  http://cobyrandal.com/new_sogmi
[19:27:47] <coby> That is what happens on my site on narrow window sizes. Dropdown gets stuck open.
[19:28:16] <andry_yosua> this fiddle is a normal resizable with the only option containment is active http://jsfiddle.net/andry_yosua/wmwzmLbc/
[19:28:29] <andry_yosua> it can resize to full width of container.. and not jumping
[19:29:03] <andry_yosua> this fiddle here is resizaable with containment and ghost option are active http://jsfiddle.net/andry_yosua/snp0w6dg/
[19:29:38] <andry_yosua> it has bug which jumping resizable element and cannot full resize to container..
[19:30:20] <andry_yosua> this fiddle here is my attempt to fixed the jumping resizable element bug http://jsfiddle.net/andry_yosua/Ly9918pn/
[19:30:46] <andry_yosua> but it still has bug.. the cannot full resize to container
[19:33:58] <andry_yosua> th last bug somehow fixed when i change this line on jquery ui js
[19:34:01] <andry_yosua> woset = Math.abs( (that._helper ? that.offset.left - cop.left : (that.offset.left - cop.left)) + that.sizeDiff.width );
[19:34:04] <andry_yosua> to
[19:34:11] <andry_yosua> woset = Math.abs( (that._helper ? that.position.left - cop.left : (that.offset.left - cop.left)) + that.sizeDiff.width );
[19:34:20] <andry_yosua> and hoset = Math.abs( (that._helper ? that.offset.top - cop.top : (that.offset.top - co.top)) + that.sizeDiff.height );
[19:34:22] <andry_yosua> to
[19:34:28] <andry_yosua> hoset = Math.abs( (that._helper ? that.position.top - cop.top : (that.offset.top - co.top)) + that.sizeDiff.height );
[19:34:48] <andry_yosua> but.. i think it;s not the proper solution
[20:01:54] <andry_yosua> it is similiar with http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8044 and http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/9575
[20:02:48] <Fall> Is there a confirmed issue with jQuery and fadeIn / fadeOut on Android devices pre 2.4?
[20:03:18] <Fall> We're currently using jQuery 1.9.2 in production and we're wondering whether if upgrading to 1.11.2 will fix things
[20:05:24] <Puck6633> Can anyone tell me why my $(window).resize() function is recursing? http://jsfiddle.net/6gwkq7cg/
[20:06:38] <Woet> Puck6633: how do you mean?
[20:07:16] <Puck6633> If you try to resize that example (by say adjusting the divider in jsfiddle) the browser hangs and in the console I get "too much recursion"
[20:07:24] <Puck6633> (Tested with Firefox 35 at least)
[20:08:48] <Woet> not in Chrome, that's why I asked
[20:08:49] <Puck6633> I'm baffled. I also tried a variation using $('.scaletext').trigger($.Event('resize')) and get the same thing
[20:09:02] <Puck6633> Really? Is it a jQuery bug then..?
[20:09:09] <Woet> not sure
[20:09:19] <Woet> but why are you binding to the .resize of scaletext?
[20:09:49] <Woet> maybe because of the font size changing, it triggers the resize function, which triggers the font size changing, which triggers the resize function, etc.
[20:09:54] <Woet> why isn't it just a separate function?
[20:10:24] <Puck6633> Hm. In Chrome 40 on Windows I get something very similar: maximum call stack size exceeded
[20:11:02] <Puck6633> I used the resize event because it seemed intuitive to me. Turns out that resize isn't called for block level elements anyway, so I just call it manually.
[20:11:25] <Puck6633> I could make it a separate function though, since this method seems to be causing problems.
[20:11:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd avoid triggering events to run code like that.
[20:11:46] <Woet> well if you resize something in the resize event
[20:11:46] <Puck6633> If you remove the manual calls though, the text doesn't resize like resize never gets called natively.
[20:11:50] <Woet> you can expect it to loop infinitely
[20:12:14] <Puck6633> So I would expect that calling resize() wouldn't trigger any events.
[20:12:35] <Puck6633> I'll just change my implementation, but I still wish I understood why that's wrong. :\
[20:12:41] <robertmaxrees> what's going on?
[20:12:46] <robertmaxrees> sorry, wasn't around.
[20:13:02] <Puck6633> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/6gwkq7cg/  <- causes recursion for some reason.
[20:13:24] <Puck6633> Even though resize isn't supposed to trigger for block elements, and in fact if it's not called manually the text size doesn't change at all.
[20:13:43] <robertmaxrees> you can still trigger a resize event manually.
[20:13:46] <robertmaxrees> which is what you're doing.
[20:14:02] <Puck6633> Right, but that causes recursion and I don't understand why.
[20:14:47] <Puck6633> It should go window.resize() -> div.resize() > end, but instead it's looping somewhere.
[20:14:54] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[20:15:05] <Puck6633> Interestingly, it only happens with $(window).resize().
[20:15:22] <Puck6633> I'm using the same code in a $.animate() callback and there's no recursion.
[20:15:43] <robertmaxrees> the event is bubbling.
[20:15:52] <Puck6633> Oh.
[20:15:55] <Puck6633> Of course!
[20:15:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/6gwkq7cg/1/\
[20:16:04] <robertmaxrees> err, http://jsfiddle.net/6gwkq7cg/1/
[20:16:27] <robertmaxrees> that fixes it.  you're triggering a resize when the window resizes, which bubbles up to the window listener and starts things all overa gain.
[20:17:01] <Puck6633> Thank you! I think I'll change my implementation anyway since it's been pointed out that it's rather silly, but I'm glad to know what I was doing wrong. :)
[20:17:13] <robertmaxrees> it happens :)
[20:48:22] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: quiet night shift in #jquery?
[20:49:21] <robertmaxrees> hah.  something like that.
[20:49:31] <robertmaxrees> how you doing?
[20:51:46] <wa5ted> pretty good, finished up some small contracts
[20:51:51] <robertmaxrees> awesome
[20:52:02] <wa5ted> looking for more/ bigger contrats to do
[20:52:54] <robertmaxrees> kind of glad i don't do freelancing because of that.
[21:00:35] <wa5ted> robertmaxrees: for me im really jsut searching for a long term contract or a real position i can fill
[21:00:43] <wa5ted> freelancing was just on the side yanno?
[21:00:45] <wa5ted> o get me started
[21:03:22] <robertmaxrees> that's fair.
[21:03:59] <wa5ted> problem is getitng clients/findin them
[21:04:29] <wa5ted> and more importantly finding a job that pays a stready wage at my intro level that i am :P
[21:31:16] <DarkGhost> hello all, quick question: I was working on an app a little bit ago and tried using .setup for ajax calls and sending an Authorization header or whatever.. but it didn't send for all my ajax calls any ideas why?
[21:32:59] <robertmaxrees> .setup ?
[21:33:03] <robertmaxrees> you mean ajaxSetup?
[21:34:15] <robertmaxrees> only thing i can think of is it'd need to run before any relevant ajax calls.
[22:09:47] <norc> Hi. Is using "this" for context a safe thing? Example: function Foo() {}; Foo.prototype.bar = function() { $.ajax({ url: "foo.html", context:this}).done(this.someRef) }
[22:10:46] <arthurvr> depends on what you would like to do. The example seems save
[22:11:34] <norc> arthurvr: Im really unsure about object lifetimes when it comes to the caller in JavaScript. Is it guaranteed that the caller survives until the callbacks complete?
[22:12:55] <norc> Oh well. I could assume this is just a reference, and as long as there is a reference to that object the garbage collector should not clean it up.
[22:13:38] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to worry about garbage collection normally anyway.
[22:14:08] <norc> robertmaxrees: I think worrying about object lifetimes in asynchronous program flow is justified.
[22:14:17] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to is what i'm saying.
[22:14:45] <robertmaxrees> you shoiuld be explicitly passing things around if you need them, since 'this' can change depending on what's getting called when.
[22:16:00] <norc> robertmaxrees: Yeah. In my case its much simpler to abuse this though. ;)
[22:16:06] <robertmaxrees> i would avoid it.
[22:16:43] <norc> robertmaxrees: It seemed like the lesser evil than doing a reverse-python style passing the object around to any of its methods.
[22:16:56] <norc> To every even.
[22:17:10] <robertmaxrees> i tend to favor the explicit passing concept.
[22:17:18] <robertmaxrees> makes it clear who's doing what.
[22:17:21] <jeremyab1l> are the values returned by .position() and .offset() affected by any css scale transformations?
[22:20:05] <norc> robertmaxrees: It just seems so overly redundant to have to explicitely pass the receiver of a method around.
[22:20:49] <robertmaxrees> it can depending on what you're doing, but 'this' can (and does) change in unexpected ways.
[22:21:10] <robertmaxrees> i tend to favor explicitly passing things around because it removes that layer of ambiguity
[22:24:42] <norc> robertmaxrees: In a perfect world the language would make object oriented design easier though.
[22:26:44] <robertmaxrees> i disagree.
[22:26:50] <robertmaxrees> i think it's just fine in a lot of ways.
[22:30:56] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: norc: OO js is awesome! (for sure with the ES6 additions we’ve seen)
[22:31:42] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer more functional JS instead.
[22:31:56] <norc> arthurvr: Yeah I heard. Actual classes and stuff right?
[22:32:09] <arthurvr> kinda sorta yes man!
[22:32:19] <robertmaxrees> more like syntactic sugar for constructors.
[22:32:23] <arthurvr> and people don’t seem to understand you can just use it today
[22:32:51] <norc> robertmaxrees: I see. Well that is fine, some people come from the LISP age, and others grow up with Ruby. :p
[22:32:57] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[22:33:07] <robertmaxrees> i grew up with ruby and still prefer FRP ;)
[22:33:12] <robertmaxrees> it's all about personal tastes.
[22:33:21] <arthurvr> f course
[22:34:45] <norc> arthurvr: Though it is what robertmaxrees said - just syntactic sugar ontop of what everybody does.
[22:34:57] <norc> So design wise it wont change anything in JS.
[22:35:36] <arthurvr> isn’t that just kinda what people wanted? I mean, there are a bunch of people that like that behaviour
[22:36:02] <robertmaxrees> i think it'll only serve to confuse people more personally.
[22:36:47] <robertmaxrees> the issue has always been that people expect inheritance in JS to work like it does in classical languages, but it doesn't./
[22:36:47] <norc> robertmaxrees: Indeed, especially since it is just syntactic sugar. If you - like myself - come from a strong c++ background, you might get be tricked with this a lot.
[22:36:48] <arthurvr> nah it might ease the proccess for other people (coming from other languages)
[22:36:59] <robertmaxrees> i don't - i come from a strong JS background,
[22:37:13] <arthurvr> but ya - have to leave
[22:37:46] <norc> robertmaxrees: In fact thats aprt of the reason I abuse this this way, so 'this' feels like a reference to the object itself (which it is if you make sure these calls have protected semantics)
[22:38:01] <robertmaxrees> norc sure - you can do that.
[22:40:02] <norc> robertmaxrees: But to be honest, JS version of 'this' is something really neat that I have craved for in Ruby a lot.
[22:40:35] <robertmaxrees> it can be a little confusing, but once you wrap your head around the basics, it's actually kind of intuitive imo.
[22:41:31] <robertmaxrees> plus you can use .call() and .apply() and .map() to really take things to the next level.
[22:44:08] <robertmaxrees> err, .bind(), not .map().  i am exhausted.
[22:44:13] <robertmaxrees> and with that, sleep.
[23:06:42] <DarkGhost> is anyone around.. I'm having a maajor problem with ajax calls and can't find a single thing similiar on google.
[23:07:45] <DarkGhost> I'm sending a post request to a backend and in the response headers I get a Set-Cookie (which I can see through the network tab in my developer tools) but I'm trying to do success: fucntion(bla,bla,xhr) { xhr.GetAllResponseHeaders() } and it's only sending back Content-Type not that Set-Cookie:, also document.cookie is ""
[23:10:02] <Woet> DarkGhost: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/
[23:10:24] <Woet> "If you want clients to be able to access other headers, you have to use the Access-Control-Expose-Headers header. The value of this header is a comma-delimited list of response headers you want to expose to the client."
[23:10:29] <DarkGhost> I thought CORS was server side, which u just have to send access-control headers
[23:10:43] <DarkGhost> on server side right?
[23:11:07] <DarkGhost> Woet This works on Postman
[23:12:53] <Woet> DarkGhost: seems like set-cookie is not meant to be there. http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/ - "Returns all headers from the response, with the exception of those whose field name is Set-Cookie or Set-Cookie2."
[23:13:03] <Woet> what are you trying to do?
[23:13:34] <DarkGhost> well basically the backend has a /auth/login which you send a username and password too and it logs you in. then if you send a get request to /auth/check it will return your id.. this works on postman
[23:13:52] <DarkGhost> but when I do it in an jquery ajax post (successfully logs in) but then the ajax get to /auth/check returns not logged in
[23:14:02] <Woet> sounds like your cookies are not set properly.
[23:14:04] <DarkGhost> and I think it's becaause that set-cookie session: isn't getting set from ajax
[23:14:06] <DarkGhost> yeah exactly
[23:14:11] <DarkGhost> so I was trying to grab the set-cookie session and set it
[23:14:14] <Woet> err
[23:14:24] <DarkGhost> is there a better way?
[23:14:26] <Woet> well
[23:14:27] <DarkGhost> thanks for the help btw
[23:14:31] <Woet> i would recommend solving the actual issue
[23:14:41] <Woet> instead of trying to create a weird workaround about something as simple as setting a cookie
[23:14:58] <Woet> pastebin your response headers with set-cookie in it
[23:15:00] <DarkGhost> well it works in postman, and works when somone uses a framework such as reactjs
[23:15:17] <Woet> setting cookies has nothing to do with jquery
[23:15:33] <DarkGhost> http://privatepaste.com/f1d2ceb258
[23:15:34] <DarkGhost> Woet
[23:15:48] <DarkGhost> that's response
[23:16:36] <Woet> what browser is this?
[23:17:57] <DarkGhost> chrome
[23:18:21] <Woet> you will have to share the relevant code
[23:21:34] <DarkGhost> Woet http://privatepaste.com/268bf91e44
[23:22:24] <Cork> DarkGhost: is the session cookie marked as secure or http only
[23:22:26] <Woet> but you are doing your /auth/check before your auth/login
[23:22:31] <Cork> in those cases you can't access them from js
[23:22:34] <Woet> Cork: check the headers, it isn't
[23:23:01] <DarkGhost> Woet I mean if I logged in.. then refreshed page it would technically be after my auth/login
[23:23:10] <DarkGhost> but either way, i've tried doing the ajax.get to auth/check right after the auth/loign
[23:23:11] <DarkGhost> same result
[23:23:52] <Woet> show the code in /auth/check
[23:24:10] <DarkGhost> the backend code?
[23:24:48] <Woet> yes
[23:25:07] <DarkGhost> it's basically just echoing a session
[23:25:21] <DarkGhost> http://privatepaste.com/95a406ab17
[23:25:31] <Cork> DarkGhost: have you checked what chrome://settings/cookies shows?
[23:26:21] <DarkGhost> Cork  there not getting set... so nothing
[23:26:35] <Cork> weird
[23:27:03] <DarkGhost> but this works fine in postman
[23:27:09] <DarkGhost> its super weird
[23:27:11] <DarkGhost> I can't figure it out
[23:27:11] <DarkGhost> :(
[23:27:41] <Cork> have you tried in another browser?
[23:29:59] <DarkGhost> Cork just tried firefox and only thing xhr.getresppponseheaders is putting in console is content-type
[23:30:03] <DarkGhost> any ideas Woet ?
[23:30:28] <Woet> stop trying to work around something as basic as setting cookies
[23:30:58] <Cork> working around? he is trying to figure out why it isn't working
[23:30:58] <Woet> setting cookies is something really basic and you should diagnose why it's not working for you
[23:31:09] <DarkGhost> ^^
[23:31:12] <Woet> Cork: he's trying to get the set-cookie header in xhr.getresppponseheaders so he can set the cookie in javascript
[23:31:18] <Woet> that is a work around.
[23:31:24] <Cork> ah, ya definitely
[23:31:37] <Woet> cookies should just be set by the browser when it receives the set-cookie header
[23:31:46] <DarkGhost> ok so whats the prob here
[23:32:00] <DarkGhost> i mean I just figured it wasn't getting set because it was getting called in an $.aja
[23:32:07] <DarkGhost> not in "Browser" necessarily
[23:32:08] <Woet> i suggest you start with a simple server-side page that sets a session and reads out a session
[23:32:15] <Woet> and make sure that works
[23:32:19] <Woet> and go from there
[23:32:49] <Cork> DarkGhost: i have a site live today that loggs you in and sets the cookie through a $.ajax call
[23:32:56] <Cork> so no, that isn't the problem
[23:32:58] <Woet> me too
[23:33:43] <DarkGhost> it does work
[23:33:54] <DarkGhost> i know that because of postman, and also becasue there is another site reactjs that uses this backend
[23:33:54] <DarkGhost> and works
[23:34:21] <DarkGhost> do you think it is becasue the site is on my localhost?
[23:34:28] <DarkGhost> sending outt request from localhost?
[23:34:42] <Cork> no the browser don't know that the domain "localhost" is anything special
[23:34:49] <DarkGhost> okay, wait... it might not work on the other han
[23:34:49] <DarkGhost> d
[23:34:56] <Cork> its just a tcp request for all it cares
[23:34:57] <Woet> did you try the one-page yet that I suggested?
[23:35:55] <Cork> DarkGhost: btw i see you use the full url in the ajax call
[23:36:06] <Cork> it is the current domain your on right?
[23:36:12] <DarkGhost> no
[23:36:18] <DarkGhost> its hosted somewher else
[23:36:20] <kevireilly_> cookies are set and sent per domain
[23:36:38] <Cork> so there is you're problem
[23:36:54] <DarkGhost> what is the problem
[23:37:09] <Cork> you set the cookie for domain x and try to access it on domain y
[23:37:13] <Cork> you can't do that
[23:37:21] <kevireilly_> security risk, big one if you think about it
[23:37:35] <kevireilly_> not being set per domain
[23:37:56] <DarkGhost> I'm confused.. I'm on localhost calling an /login/ on http://bla.com
[23:38:01] <Cork> if the browser allows third party cookies you should get a cookie set for the different domain
[23:38:17] <Cork> DarkGhost: if third party cookies is allowed you should get a cookie on bla.com
[23:38:21] <Cork> NOT localhost
[23:38:28] <Cork> and you won't be able to access this cookie
[23:38:34] <Cork> as your on localhost
[23:38:56] <DarkGhost> well either way it should have a session set on bla.com that I logged in?
[23:38:59] <Cork> if third party cookie is blocked, it just won't be set at all
[23:39:00] <DarkGhost> even if it didn't set on my localhost right?
[23:39:09] <Cork> see what i just typed
[23:40:08] <DarkGhost> http://cl.ly/image/2b423M1Z0l0k no exeptions
[23:41:51] <Cork> browsers has an option to block third party cookies unless they are set as normal cookies first, not sure if chrome has this
[23:42:02] <DarkGhost> ugh this is fuccckked lol
[23:42:05] <DarkGhost> its late tho
[23:42:07] <DarkGhost> ill have to try tomorrow
[23:42:08] <Cork> (at least firefox and safari has it, i think ie does too)
[23:42:46] <Cork> so start diagnosing the cookie setting
[23:42:54] <Cork> cause you won't ever get access to the cookie through js
[23:43:07] <Cork> so that solution isn't possible at all
[23:43:25] <DarkGhost> you think its server side
[23:43:27] <DarkGhost> ?
[23:43:33] <kevireilly_> make sure it is the same domain first. Cookies will only be sent with future requests if they originate from the same domain. So, if localhost sets a cookie, only request from a page loaded from http://localhost will send that cookie back to the localhost server
[23:43:37] <Cork> i think it is cause of cors
[23:43:46] <DarkGhost> well kevireilly_  how come postman works
[23:44:21] <Cork> DarkGhost: many console clients/server side clients doesn't do cors restrictions
[23:44:23] <Cork> browsers do
[23:44:25] <kevireilly_> I may have missed that part of the conversation, but I’m not sure unless the browser is somehow related because it is responsible for storing and sending cookies
[23:45:00] <DarkGhost> so were going with server side Cork ?
[23:45:05] <Cork> no
[23:45:11] <Cork> man.. read my responses!
[23:45:15] <DarkGhost> i am.
[23:45:19] <DarkGhost> cors is server side
[23:45:31] <DarkGhost> if i send xhrFields { withCredentials:
[23:45:41] <DarkGhost> I get something like some header needs to respond with true
[23:45:46] <Cork> DarkGhost: what part of "<Cork> i think it is cause of cors" says "it's server side"?
[23:46:08] <DarkGhost> I thought cors is alwyas server side
[23:46:10] <Cork> no cors is a restriction the browser enforces
[23:46:22] <Cork> it enforces it so servers can't steal user data
[23:46:47] <Cork> like grabbing your address from facebook
[23:46:54] <Cork> or changing your gmail password
[23:47:52] <DarkGhost> hmm ok
[23:48:10] <DarkGhost> well thnak you for the help Cork
[23:48:11] <DarkGhost> it's really late
[23:48:15] <DarkGhost> I have to sleep on it lol
[23:48:29] <Cork> cors headers is something the server can send the browser to loosen those restrictions, kinda like "i can protect myself from xss so allow this"
[23:50:08] <DarkGhost> http://pastebin.com/C62Pqzyy server is already sending this Cork
[23:50:31] <Cork> cors headers doesn't affect browser settings
[23:50:48] <Cork> but cors affect how the browser looks at set-cookie
[23:53:00] <kevireilly_> that is interesting, wasn’t aware of that
[23:53:12] <DarkGhost> hmm ok
[23:53:17] <kevireilly_> DarkGhost: I would try a simple “*” in place of `origin` in that example as a quick test
[23:53:22] <kevireilly_> means allow all the things
[23:53:52] <kevireilly_> rather, all the origins
[23:54:26] <Cork> kevireilly_: i've had problem with * but never with the real origin
[23:54:35] <Cork> so i don't think that will do anything
[23:56:13] <Cork> and recompiling the server to make the header less specific sounds kinda wasteful
[23:56:44] <DarkGhost> lllol
[23:57:54] <kevireilly_> I’m not doubting you’ve had issues with it in the past, but I’m certain that * means I don’t care what the origin is, I’ll allow a request from anywhere
[23:58:30] <Cork> kevireilly_: yes, by the spec * should work if you don't have the processing capability to return the origin the request sends you
[23:58:46] <Cork> but i know browsers has failed to handle this
[23:58:47] <kevireilly_> toats, google maps as an example is surely using *
[23:59:37] <Cork> kevireilly_: origin is guaranteed to work as it say "YOU'RE ALLOWED" instead of "anyone whoever they are may"
[23:59:45] <Cork> so the browser doesn't have to have special code to do the check
