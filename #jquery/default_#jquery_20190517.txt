[08:16:36] <Anthaas> Hi all - I have an object of objects. Each nested object has properties "state" and "city". I want to get a mapping of unique states to unique cities. How can I do this?
[08:20:50] <Cork> Anthaas: you would have to make a recursiv function and then populate an array/object of uniq values you encounter
[08:31:28] <thykka> or you could construct a Map from it
[08:31:34] <thykka> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map
[08:32:09] <thykka> er..
[08:32:15] <thykka> A Set, not a Map..
[08:32:19] <thykka> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set
[08:32:54] <Anthaas> Recursion definitely not necessary. I've done it iteratively, checking for keys. A set would be unnecessarily complex. In this case iteratively is definitely the simplest choice, I was just wondering if there was some built in method which could have done it.
[08:32:55] <Anthaas> Cheers!
[08:33:22] <Cork> Anthaas: depends on how deep the nesting is you need to deal with
[08:33:43] <thykka> A set cannot have dupe keys, so the end result would only contain unique keys
[08:34:22] <thykka> but you don't have to check whether the key already exists, Set handles this automagically
[09:59:54] <simulant> Hi can anyone help me out with this page: http://www.pinnacleconservation.co.uk/our-people/
[10:00:02] <simulant> I can't seem to get the scrolling profile images the size I want
[10:00:10] <simulant> they are stuck at 400px x 636px - I've set the javascript to show 5 images in the script call but they just proportionally scale smaller with the originals still being that set size...
[11:10:00] <R13ose> Hi
[12:32:03] <joMamma02> can someone explain to me exactly what rabbitmq and sidekiq is and what it does
[12:33:19] <joMamma02> is this channel active?
[12:35:21] <joMamma02> hello?
[13:18:36] <joMamma02> hello?
[13:18:56] <taplar> yo yo yo
[13:19:10] <taplar> err, fk, missed a 'jo jo jo' joke....
[13:19:23] <taplar> anyway, what's up?
[13:24:37] <R13ose> Hi
[13:25:26] <joMamma02> can someone explain to me exactly what rabbitmq and sidekiq is and what it does
[13:25:41] <taplar> joMamma02 ask in #web or ##javascript
[13:26:25] <taplar> R13ose aloha.  I believe robert mentioned yesterday you should just ask your question, rather than just saying hi.  *poke poke*
[13:26:50] <joMamma02> i need to integrate it with jquery. how would i do that?
[13:27:47] <R13ose> I am failing to have an input value put into a JSON array properly. Code: https://pastebin.com/1cBr9GDE How do I get mdata on line 17 into the array on line 44?
[13:28:00] <R13ose> taplar: I can't say hi?
[13:28:08] <taplar> joMamma02 no idea.  Those two things are not the same type of software.  One's an mq related software, the other is... some sort of job scheduler software.  It's not clear what either of those has to do with the front end browser.
[13:28:32] <joMamma02> you dont know how to do it?
[13:28:35] <taplar> R13ose you can, but don't stop there.  It's not necessary, and it's slightly awkward to say "hi" "hi", when we're waiting for your question, :)
[13:28:43] <taplar> joMamma02 it's off topic for the room
[13:28:55] <taplar> and no, i'm not familiar with those open source software packages
[13:29:26] <joMamma02> why?
[13:29:49] <R13ose> How do you know I have a question?  Can't I say hi and ask nothing?
[13:29:55] <taplar> i'm simply not.  again, please direct your questions to #web if you have questions about software not related to jQuery
[13:30:15] <taplar> R13ose why though?
[13:30:31] <joMamma02> is there anyone in here knows jquery?
[13:30:49] <R13ose> Being friendly but I can stop
[13:31:38] <taplar> R13ose http://www.nohello.com/
[13:32:11] <joMamma02> i thought this room would be more active
[13:32:23] <R13ose> Okay onto my question above
[13:32:24] <joMamma02> jquery i guess is not popular anymor
[13:33:09] <taplar> joMamma02 if you have a question about jQuery, please ask it.  but you are not guarenteed to get help with implementing jQuery into some third part software if members do not know anything about those software sources.
[13:34:47] <taplar> R13ose where is testing() called?
[13:35:19] <R13ose> taplar: not in this code but when I click a button.
[13:36:01] <taplar> which button?  i see where you are setting the mdata as part of an event handler, but it's unclear if testing() is being called before of after that point in time
[13:36:52] <R13ose> taplar: this is not in the code I pasted.  It is testing(mdata);
[13:37:11] <taplar> where are you doing that at?  please show me
[13:37:41] <R13ose> taplar: you want me to add that into a new pastebin?
[13:38:02] <taplar> without seeing what you have I can only guess, or keep asking you to tell me the details
[13:38:19] <R13ose> Give me a second
[13:41:32] <R13ose> Code: https://pastebin.com/4KYpUSxQ
[13:42:04] <taplar> ok, so the first thing to point out is, you are not using the `e` passed into the method
[13:42:43] <taplar> the second thing to point out is you don't have to do that.  `mdata` is scoped outside all the functions.  If that is accurate, it is available in all of them
[13:44:18] <taplar> which line 48 uses the global `mdata` so i'm not sure why you're passing it in anway
[13:44:29] <R13ose> I am not using e, what is e prevent default?
[13:44:48] <taplar> did you write this code?
[13:44:53] <R13ose> Yes
[13:45:10] <taplar> so, why did you put e.preventDefault() in there?
[13:46:05] <taplar> "// Prevent form submission"
[13:46:17] <R13ose> Yes.
[13:46:39] <taplar> so your "what is e prevent default?" question confuses me
[13:46:48] <taplar> you seem to know what you're doing there
[13:47:09] <R13ose> I was saying that because you said I am not using e
[13:47:23] <taplar> you are not using the `e` passed into the method
[13:47:30] <taplar> line 31
[13:48:09] <R13ose> I get that now
[13:48:22] <R13ose> I was told recently global vars is bad
[13:48:39] <taplar> global variables should be avoided if possible, yes
[13:49:05] <R13ose> How would I do this without a global var?
[13:49:30] <taplar> how do you get the value for mdata in the first place?
[13:49:49] <R13ose> From a modal window input box
[13:49:55] <taplar> from an input
[13:50:09] <taplar> does that input still exist?
[13:50:20] <R13ose> Meaning?
[13:50:30] <taplar> are you ever removing that input from the DOM?
[13:51:13] <taplar> line 16
[13:51:52] <R13ose> I think so when I close the modal
[13:52:00] <taplar> then, look at line 17
[13:52:11] <taplar> if it was removed, how would line 17 work?
[13:52:56] <R13ose> It is hidden not removed removed
[13:53:04] <taplar> you bet
[13:53:24] <R13ose> I don't bet :)
[13:53:32] <taplar> so, it still exists when you try to do your later function
[13:53:54] <R13ose> Yes
[13:54:01] <taplar> so you could get it's value then
[13:54:41] <R13ose> Okay
[13:55:39] <R13ose> Yet, doesn't answer the original issue
[13:56:04] <taplar> along the path to dealing with your original issue, we're also going to point out other issues
[13:56:38] <R13ose> Very helpful thanks
[14:41:08] <joMamma02> anyone know how to integrate jquery with rabbitmq and sidekiq?
[15:02:37] <R13ose> taplar: any other thoughts?
[15:02:56] <taplar> have you made any changes based of our last discussion?
[15:06:45] <R13ose> Not yet but I know how to do them.  This was remove mdata from testing call and use mdata directly in testing.  Was there anything else to use?
[15:07:30] <taplar> Not to use mdata directly.  To get the value from the DOM in that method.  You don't need the mdata variable at all, outside that method
[15:08:13] <taplar> Once you get that refactored, update your codepen and reshare it
[15:12:45] <R13ose> Code: https://pastebin.com/BR2xLtST
[15:15:14] <R13ose> taplar: ^
[15:15:21] <taplar> line 24, 46, both still using mdata
[15:16:01] <R13ose> Line 24 doesn't for me
[15:16:19] <taplar> sorry, 34
[15:16:50] <R13ose> Oh
[15:17:02] <R13ose> Let me think
[15:24:31] <R13ose> New code: https:/pastebin.com/z3YFLcum when I use JSON.stringify around the code in ugs, this says TypeError: "length" is read-only so I took that out.
[15:25:29] <taplar> What is line 43 doing?
[15:26:25] <R13ose> Trying to make ugs first part of array and push x into ugs so is the second part of array.  All in ugs
[15:26:46] <taplar> But what is that line actually doing?
[15:27:02] <taplar> What does this do: Array.prototype.push.apply
[15:27:17] <taplar> and why do you need that?
[15:27:44] <R13ose> It pushes x into ugs
[15:28:05] <taplar> think about what you just said
[15:28:06] <R13ose> I am trying to get one variable in with the JSON array
[15:28:28] <taplar> you don't need that prototype line
[15:28:35] <taplar> array1.push(newValue)
[15:28:47] <taplar> but that's not the main problem
[15:29:01] <taplar> you are trying to push `x` into `ugs`
[15:29:11] <taplar> in order to be able to do that, what must be true?
[15:29:54] <R13ose> Both variables might be must be true.
[15:30:15] <taplar> no, there's not a truthy thing here.  this is an operation
[15:30:42] <taplar> if you want to add two numbers together, what do you need first?
[15:31:01] <R13ose> To be the same format
[15:31:12] <taplar> think more simply
[15:31:24] <R13ose> For them to be numbers
[15:31:29] <taplar> more simply
[15:32:02] <R13ose> I don't know
[15:32:13] <taplar> you have to have them, at all, yes?
[15:32:23] <taplar> can't add two things, if you don't have both of them
[15:32:49] <R13ose> They both exist if that is what you mean
[15:33:01] <taplar> i'm trying to get you to think about the facts of what you are doing
[15:33:17] <R13ose> My code might not show them
[15:33:21] <taplar> you are trying to take `something`, and push it to an array.  yes?
[15:33:36] <R13ose> Yes
[15:33:45] <taplar> so for that to happen, what must be true?
[15:33:53] <taplar> what must you have?
[15:34:17] <R13ose> A way to push this into the array?
[15:34:26] <taplar> no
[15:34:50] <R13ose> The value?
[15:35:02] <taplar> you have to have both the value, and the array you want to push the value into
[15:35:13] <taplar> meaning one of the two things must be an array
[15:35:42] <R13ose> What I wrote isn't an object array?
[15:35:42] <taplar> the element you are trying to push to, *must* be an array
[15:35:47] <taplar> no dude
[15:35:59] <taplar> object array isn't a thing
[15:36:09] <taplar> you have objects ( {} ) and you have arrays ( [] )
[15:36:29] <taplar> an array can contain objects, but it's not an "object array"
[15:36:38] <R13ose> Oh
[15:37:23] <taplar> so, line 43.  what's wrong?
[15:38:09] <R13ose> I am trying to push an array into another array
[15:38:14] <taplar> no...
[15:38:28] <taplar> you are trying to push an array into an object
[15:39:02] <taplar> that line should be: x.push(ugs)
[15:39:24] <R13ose> Okay
[15:42:03] <R13ose> That might have worked.
[15:42:48] <R13ose> Worked
[15:42:54] <taplar> :)
[15:43:48] <R13ose> I might have another issue with the code, give me a second to figure out.
[15:53:35] <R13ose> Can I pass words that will be indicator of which sheet to use?
[15:53:55] <taplar> not sure what you're asking
[15:56:36] <R13ose> I mean I do x.push(ugs); but what if I need to post word(s) so Google Sheets knows which sheet to use. Do I just push the word(s) into the array or is there another way?
[15:57:22] <taplar> i'm not sure I understand how the two are connected
[15:57:40] <taplar> x is just an array with objects representing the key value pairs from your form
[15:57:57] <taplar> if you need to include more stuff in that array, that's up to you
[15:58:29] <R13ose> Let me show you the Google side code and what I need to do
[16:01:28] <R13ose> Code: https://pastebin.com/EP59TGdP on line 38, I need to be able to know which sheet to push the data into as I will have multiple sheets.
[16:02:47] <taplar> sure, the argument you are passing into that method could be a variable.  It's already a variable, but given that it's in all upper cases that (to me) says its currently some constant.
[16:03:29] <R13ose> It is a var now as you see on line 7
[16:04:38] <taplar> ok, so it's not a constant, so that's an odd naming pattern.  But what I said is still true.  If you want to change what you pass into that method, you can
[16:06:37] <R13ose> So I would need to push a word(s) into the array and somehow get the word(s) to be called in line 38?
[16:07:27] <taplar> why do you need to push it to that array.  again, i'm unclear how the two are related
[16:08:19] <taplar> you're array is being given to the $.post to make a request.
[16:09:12] <R13ose> Well, there will be different sections and I need to know which section the person is on when they click the button.  When I know that, I should be able to enter the data on the right sheet.
[16:09:48] <taplar> and how is that post request related to the sheet logic?
[16:10:45] <R13ose> How else would I be able to tell everything I said above?
[16:11:13] <R13ose> How else would I be able to tell what I said above?
[16:11:32] <taplar> I have no idea how these two things are related.  All I know is you're clicking some button and making an ajax request.  I have no idea what this sheets logic is and how it's related.
[16:12:02] <taplar> You have to remember that I'm not sitting in front of your code and I'm not familiar with it.
[16:12:09] <R13ose> I am pushing data to the sheet.  The $.post goes to the sheet based on the url.
[16:12:22] <taplar> a post request cannot go to a sheet
[16:12:24] <taplar> it goes to a server
[16:12:38] <R13ose> True
[16:13:10] <R13ose> The server goes to that sheet code and puts in the data
[16:13:29] <taplar> then your server will need to grab something from your data you provided to the post to know what to do
[16:13:44] <taplar> if you are not giving that post that information, then yes, you'll need to add more to your post data
[16:14:22] <R13ose> Okay but can I just add word(s) or do I need this in the same format as the others?
[16:14:47] <taplar> the data you are giving to the post request is key value pairs.  it has to be in the same format
[16:15:37] <R13ose> Okay.
[16:16:01] <R13ose> How would I pull out that data when passed and use that as the sheet name?
[16:16:41] <taplar> What language is your backend written in?  That question is falling outside the scope of jQuery
[16:17:00] <R13ose> True
[16:17:06] <R13ose> This is not jQuery
[18:22:17] <TikityTik> how do I use $.post to upload files from    form(method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data")?
[18:26:07] <TikityTik> nvm, i think i found it https://stackoverflow.com/a/21045034/1766555
[18:26:17] <TikityTik> but am i able to also send an object with it?
[18:31:13] <shoky_> TikityTik: what do yo mean by an object?
[18:31:26] <TikityTik> like extra stuff like strings and numbers
[18:31:51] <TikityTik> like price, name, description, etc
[18:33:01] <shoky_> sure, with the FormData methods, they show an example in your link
[18:33:48] <shoky_> .set() or .append()
[18:33:49] <TikityTik> FormData methods?
[18:34:28] <shoky_> the methods on the FormData object
[18:34:46] <shoky_> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData#Methods
[18:35:09] <shoky_> in your link they have e.g.  formData.append('section', 'general');
[18:35:16] <TikityTik> ahhhh i see
[18:37:02] <shoky_> TikityTik: and if you already have the values in a <form> you can init the FormData with  new FormData(theForm)
[18:46:23] <TikityTik> shoky_: am i able to do var item = {name:name, price:price}; formData.append('item', item);?
[18:56:52] <shoky_> TikityTik: no, only strings and files/blobs.  you can send a JSON string if you want, of course
[18:57:03] <shoky_> (using JSON.stringify() )
[18:57:18] <TikityTik> ahhh i see
[18:57:43] <TikityTik> thank you
[18:57:50] <shoky_> np
[19:57:25] <javango> Hello! I've got a problem with events binding. I'm binding click handler to .myclass and when I click on it, the handler fires two times. If I bind let's say to mouseleave event, it will fire one time. What can it be?
[19:57:48] <robertmaxrees> javango a couple things - do you have multiple .myclass elements nested?
[19:58:08] <javango> no nested elements. One .myclass element on my page
[19:58:15] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle then?
[20:02:35] <javango> robertmaxrees, it would be difficult to do. I created a simple fiddle and it works.
[20:02:46] <robertmaxrees> can you share the page where the error is happening?
[20:04:17] <robertmaxrees> alternatively - how do you know it's firing more than once?
[20:05:17] <javango> robertmaxrees, I do console.log in the handler
[20:06:17] <robertmaxrees> so one line before you bind, stick a console.log('foo'); there - do you see that twice?
[20:06:18] <pavonia> Make sure the handler is only bound once
[20:06:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:07:22] <javango> robertmaxrees, Yes, I did so. Binding occurs only one
[20:07:26] <javango> *once
[20:07:33] <robertmaxrees> then i have no clue.  i'd have to see the bug happen.
[20:08:07] <javango> I can't show you the page, but thanks for helping
[20:08:28] <robertmaxrees> do a $('.myclass').length - what do you get?
[20:10:46] <javango> robertmaxrees, initially I've got two elements with such class. But now I left only one and $('.myclass').length show 1. And if I click it now, it fires one time. If I click it 2nd, 3rd... time it fires twice
[20:10:50] <javango> :/
[20:11:07] <robertmaxrees> can you share the code for the event binding?
[20:11:46] <javango> $('.myclass').on('click', function (event) {...}
[20:11:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:11:58] <robertmaxrees> i mean the function body itself.
[20:12:08] <robertmaxrees> gotta give us something to work with here ;)
[20:14:47] <javango> No, I will search by cutting off everything one by one. I just needed any quick versions of what else can cause the trouble
[20:14:58] <javango> So, thanks
[20:15:03] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[20:15:07] <robertmaxrees> good luck then :)
[20:30:59] <pavonia> I always imagine people behaving the same way when they visit their doctor: "I'm sick, can you help me?" -- "What do you have?" -- "Pain." -- "Well, where?" -- "In my body." -- "Can you show me where exactly?" -- "No, have a guess!" :3
[20:31:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:32:17] <robertmaxrees> i think it comes down to experience tbh.  it's hard to know how much detail to give if you're not used to dealing with the library.
[20:34:51] <javango> robertmaxrees, I think I found the problem
[20:34:53] <javango> https://jsfiddle.net/Lwqp24r3/
[20:35:09] <robertmaxrees> ?
[20:35:16] <pavonia> robertmaxrees: Not sure. In other channels I also see people who have been there for years pasting small snippets of code when being asked for a MWE
[20:35:47] <robertmaxrees> pavonia there are a lot of copy/paste devs out there.  or people with aspirations of becoming devs but don't want to put in the work.
[20:36:02] <robertmaxrees> javango https://i.imgur.com/IJ9bJE9.png
[20:36:04] <javango> .myclass is surrounding input element. So when I click on .myclass it is somehow triggers action on input which is triggering .myclass again
[20:36:12] <javango> oh sorry
[20:36:24] <javango> https://jsfiddle.net/Lwqp24r3/1/
[20:37:00] <robertmaxrees> javango are you trying to figure out when a radio is clicked?
[20:37:46] <javango> yes
[20:38:18] <robertmaxrees> why not use the "change" event?
[20:38:33] <javango> If I put .myclass to input elements - everything work fine. But I don't know if it is proper solution
[20:38:45] <javango> change on input element?
[20:38:55] <javango> sound good
[20:38:58] <javango> *sounds
[20:39:03] <robertmaxrees> or use a delegated handler.
[20:39:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/8513ta94/
[20:40:01] <javango> oh :o
[20:40:08] <javango> thank you!
