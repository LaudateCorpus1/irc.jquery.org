[00:23:50] <[E]sc> my error message from my script comes back as blank and nothing else... not sure what is wrong, can anyone help me out? http://pastebin.com/TG0W521R
[00:24:41] <Cork> [E]sc: you mean you get 'Error '?
[00:25:19] <Cork> [E]sc: btw don't use element selectors before ids => $('textarea#write') should be $('#write')
[00:27:52] <[E]sc> thanks Cork for the suggestion.  I only get Error, but no explanation as to what is causing the error.  I tried sending to a blank php file, which just json_encode the variable back, but still has that unknown error
[00:28:17] <Cork> [E]sc: and whats in the throw variable?
[00:29:17] <[E]sc> just text that was written in the textarea,..
[00:29:36] <Cork> hmm
[00:29:37] <Cork> ah
[00:29:54] <Cork> try => data: { post: postText },
[00:30:49] <Cork> your not encoding the postText so that might be the cause
[00:31:00] <Cork> (the code i gave you will encode it)
[00:33:30] <[E]sc> ok thanks Cork i'll try that.
[00:36:23] <enerel> hello
[00:46:23] <[E]sc> Cork, no luck...side question: is there a big difference in the notation you gave me and the one I was using?
[00:46:50] <Cork> [E]sc: yes
[00:46:57] <Cork> the one you used is a string
[00:47:13] <Cork> jquery does nothing to it, you need to make all the handling your self
[00:47:42] <Cork> the object one, is processed by jquery, and a valid url encoded params string is generated
[00:48:49] <[E]sc> ahh...thanks Cork.  I'll look into that some more.  As for the error, the xhr.responseText is coming back empty.
[00:49:12] <Cork> [E]sc: if the connection marked as failing?
[00:49:20] <Cork> whats the error code?
[00:50:20] <Cork> [E]sc: btw data: { post: postText } is the same as data: "post=" + encodeURIComponent(postText)
[00:52:07] <[E]sc> Thanks Cork, the first notation is much more simple though, so i will use that.  No error code coming back,...
[00:52:25] <Cork> [E]sc: so it sounds like a parsing error
[00:52:36] <Cork> [E]sc: what minecode are you sending from the server?
[00:54:01] <[E]sc> Cork,  json_encode.
[00:54:10] <Cork> no, thats what your doing
[00:54:21] <Cork> Content-Type: in the response header
[00:56:31] <[E]sc> ahh... text/html;charset=utf-8
[00:56:46] <Cork> ok, so that shouldn't cause a parsing error...
[00:57:41] <Cork> [E]sc: is the post target on the same server as the page?
[00:58:26] <Cork> hmm btw, try removing the dataType: "html", line
[00:58:35] <Cork> hmm
[00:59:36] <Cork> na, that shouldn't cause any problem
[01:00:04] <[E]sc> Cork, I removed it, but it still has an empty error message.
[01:00:24] <Cork> can't see anything else that would cause errors
[01:00:38] <Cork> can you reproduce this is a testcase file?
[01:00:51] <Cork> (where you post on dom ready and only load jquery)
[01:01:02] <Cork> with a static postText that is
[01:02:51] <[E]sc> Cork, yes.  I removed all.  Even the php file is just returning the echo json_encode();
[01:03:31] <Cork> [E]sc: and if the php file is just an empty file?
[01:03:42] <Cork> no script tag or anything
[01:06:30] <enerel> Cork: how to write in jquery body onload=?
[01:07:24] <Cork> enerel: $(document).on('load', function() {});
[01:07:53] <[E]sc> Cork, something strange just happened: I limited the maxlength of the textarea, and when I exceed this, I get a successful response from the server, returning the json_encode variable i sent back.
[01:08:16] <enerel> thanks Cork
[01:08:19] <Cork> [E]sc: http://jsfiddle.net/bk2m9/
[01:08:27] <Cork> [E]sc: can you reproduce the problem there?
[01:08:54] <Cork> opps forgot to remove the element selector http://jsfiddle.net/bk2m9/1/
[01:08:59] <enerel> sorry all one question
[01:09:14] <Cork> enerel: no prob, just ask it
[01:11:00] <enerel> i want to call $('.percentage').easyPieChart({animate: 1000}); } easy pie chart into this first slide http://jsfiddle.net/m34cL/
[01:11:18] <enerel> do not know where to put it
[01:11:48] <Cork> enerel: too little context, include a bit more of the related code
[01:11:55] <enerel> okay
[01:13:17] <enerel> http://jsfiddle.net/m34cL/1/ i think i need add around line 290
[01:13:37] <enerel> i want to put the jquery easypie chart on first slide
[01:14:09] <enerel> so that everytime first slide loades pie chart animation also trigger
[01:14:51] <Cork> and you want to add a piechart to each slide layer?
[01:15:01] <enerel> no just first
[01:15:04] <Cork> hmm
[01:16:02] <enerel> 290 does that i think
[01:16:05] <enerel> line
[01:18:17] <enerel> i called piechart between 292 if statement but not working
[01:18:50] <Cork> enerel: no, that just prepares the layers for the plugin
[01:18:59] <enerel> oh
[01:20:18] <Cork> enerel: what you want is ls.o.cbNext(); and ls.o.cbPref();
[01:20:20] <[E]sc> Cork...figured out the error...a very stupid mistake on my part.  I forgot to remove the form wrapper from the textarea,... thanks so much!
[01:20:47] <Cork> enerel: or possibly ls.next/ls.prev
[01:21:12] <Cork> [E]sc: ah, you should prob keep the form wrapper, and bind the submit on it instead
[01:22:21] <Cork> enerel: ah, there is it
[01:22:28] * TnR Buenas
[01:22:33] <Cork> enerel: line 582 and 605
[01:23:18] <enerel> ok
[01:23:26] <Cork> enerel: no, actually both calls change so 629
[01:23:45] <AdamPDotty> 23²
[01:25:09] <enerel> Cork: thanks
[01:25:40] <enerel> so i do like if(num==1){bla bla}
[01:31:56] <Cork> enerel: ya, that sounds like it should work
[01:32:38] <Cork> enerel: note though, i haven't run the code so you will have to test that it actually does what you expect
[01:32:44] <[E]sc> Cork, i changed the .on() to .submit().  but the error still shows up. unless i remove the form?
[01:33:18] <Cork> [E]sc: 1. the submit should be on the form, 2. the form should do event.preventDefault()
[01:33:38] <enerel> Cork: i really apreciate your help, thanks buddy
[01:33:48] <Cork> [E]sc: with that you should have a more "native" feeing to the form
[01:33:53] <Cork> enerel: np
[01:37:30] <[E]sc> Cork,...Sweet the event.preventDefault fixed everything.  thanks so much!
[01:37:49] <Cork> [E]sc: yw
[01:37:59] <[E]sc> time to get drunk lol
[01:38:47] <PonyoDesktop> http://dev.neurobots.net/test/stupid.html  Hi i'm really new to jquery and even newer to jquery-ui.  I've been trying to follow the example for a simple dialog box.  How do I hide the text for the dialog box so it doesn't show on page load?
[01:39:05] <enerel> Cork: does not work
[01:39:23] <enerel> other guy said 23? is it?
[01:40:09] <Cork> enerel: have you verified that the code is called?
[01:40:26] <enerel> yes, it is called
[01:40:45] <Cork> PonyoDesktop: <div id="dialog" style="display: none;">text</div>
[01:40:56] <enerel> you can see it live at http://kefelon.com/upload
[01:40:56] <Cork> enerel: and what isn't working?
[01:40:58] <PonyoDesktop> ty :)
[01:41:29] <enerel> everytime 1st slide calls i want to see it animating
[01:41:54] <PonyoDesktop> Wow progress thank you!
[01:44:09] <Cork> enerel: $('.percentage').easyPieChart({animate: 1000}); doens't trigger a reanimation
[01:44:18] <Cork> enerel: you will have to look into how to do that
[01:44:44] <enerel> okay
[01:46:41] <enerel> $(this).data('easyPieChart').update(newValue); this is how update works
[01:51:49] <Cork> enerel: also your page breaks on reload :/
[01:52:26] <Cork> some of the images are lost in firefox, the entire slider is lost in chrome
[01:56:54] <enerel> Cork: which reload? i did f5 it does not break
[01:56:59] <enerel> can you send me screenshot?
[01:57:40] <Anticom> hi all
[01:57:46] <Anticom> why has .live() been removed?!
[01:57:56] <Anticom> it died so young.... R.I.P. .live() :(
[01:59:41] <Anticom> but seriously now: instead what should i use? .delegate() or .on()? are there any differences? since .on() is told to use for jq 1.7
[01:59:58] <Anticom> 1.7+, will .delegate() also be deprecated soon
[02:02:12] <Eviltwin> I don't believe .delegate is deprecated, it's just been superseded
[02:02:27] <Anticom> so recommendation would be .on() i suppose (?)
[02:02:34] <Eviltwin> Yes
[02:11:48] <boytoy> crankharder: ended up with this https://github.com/tegansnyder/JQuery-Mobile-Slide-Menu
[02:12:55] <Cork> enerel: ya f5 breaks here
[02:13:15] <Cork> Anticom: cause .live was flawed from the start
[02:13:28] <Anticom> was it?! :O
[02:13:33] <Cork> Anticom: is has a serious bug in how its syntax
[02:13:34] <Anticom> i never had any trouble with it Cork
[02:13:42] <Anticom> ah okay
[02:13:50] <Anticom> morning btw Cork :)
[02:13:59] <Cork> Anticom:  $('targets').live() will search through the entire dom
[02:14:11] <Cork> then throw away the matched elements
[02:14:24] <Cork> and THEN godo $(document) and bind an event listener
[02:14:34] <Anticom> lol
[02:14:38] <Cork> Anticom: you should be using delegate or on (in delegate mode)
[02:14:47] <Cork> it does the same thing without the extra dom search
[02:14:56] <Anticom> delegate mode?
[02:15:47] <Cork> $('.target').live('click', function() {}) === $(document).delegate('.target', 'click', function() {}) === $(document).on('click', '.target', function() {})
[02:15:51] <xec> isn't delegate just an alias for .on() nowadays?
[02:15:55] <Cork> it is
[02:16:04] <Cork> if your > 1.7 that is
[02:16:12] <xec> you're*
[02:16:23] <Anticom> hmm click handlers don't fire now
[02:16:24] <Cork> but delegate and on both works just as well
[02:16:37] <Anticom> i'm loading stuff via ajax and insert html build from that data
[02:16:45] <Anticom> and on those elements i want to have click handlers
[02:17:02] <Cork> ?p @ Anticom
[02:17:02] <bot-t> Anticom, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:17:07] <Anticom> ._.
[02:17:38] <xec> Anticom: then bind to a parent and use a delegate, like $(".myParentWhichIsAlwaysPresent").on("click", ".myGeneratedContent", func...)
[02:17:45] <Anticom> what could not be self explaining about that?! But for the sake of a good start into the day i'll fiddle it
[02:18:26] <Cork> Anticom: sounds like $(".myParentWhichIsAlwaysPresent") isn't always pressent
[02:18:40] <Cork> thats why the code (and html) is needed
[02:20:00] <Anticom> well the container is present, but that's not the direct parent of the element wich should have the click handler
[02:20:04] <xec> yeah i meant ancestor, not parent
[02:20:04] <xec> sorry for the confusion
[02:20:06] <xec> (so it should be fine)
[02:20:40] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/TpfyK/
[02:22:03] <xec> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/TpfyK/1/
[02:22:28] <xec> Anticom: or rather, http://jsfiddle.net/TpfyK/2/
[02:39:00] <Anticom> ty xec sorry, had to go afk... our scanner just died -.-
[02:39:10] <Anticom> i hate monday mornings...
[02:39:35] <Cork> Anticom: on is a collection function, it can do the same thing as both delegate and bind
[02:39:42] <BadCodSmell> Why doesn't data always work between events forcing me to also put the data into the attr using element.attr('data-key', JSON.stringify(value);?
[02:39:48] <Cork> so you need to use the syntax to make it delegate
[02:40:13] <xec> BadCodSmell: first i've heard of it. do you have a demo?
[02:40:14] <Cork> BadCodSmell: i've asked for an example of your problem for weeks now
[02:40:23] <Cork> until you actually can make a testcase we can't help you
[02:40:27] <BadCodSmell> Cork: I have confirmed this is the case.
[02:40:42] <xec> that doesn't help us. at all.
[02:40:44] <Cork> BadCodSmell: the share the testcase
[02:40:50] <BadCodSmell> I have a function: set_element_data
[02:40:54] <BadCodSmell> I always use this function
[02:41:00] <xec> ?demo @ BadCodSmell
[02:41:00] <b-ot> BadCodSmell: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:41:01] <Cork> until we can see what causes it we can't help you
[02:41:02] <bot-t> BadCodSmell, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or if you cannot do that, provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:41:18] <BadCodSmell> Cork: The problem is, I'm setting the data for thousands of elements
[02:41:25] <BadCodSmell> It's hard to say what is actually triggering it
[02:41:35] <Cork> BadCodSmell: so your code most likely bugs somewhere
[02:41:38] <Cork> and resets the data or something
[02:41:43] <BadCodSmell> but the solid fact is, data is failing to retrieve the data
[02:41:54] <BadCodSmell> Cork: then let me show you what I am doing...
[02:41:58] <Cork> or you clone it without keeping the data associated or
[02:42:08] <Cork> we, can only guess until we have a testcase
[02:45:11] <BadCodSmell> set_element_data(element, key, value) { element.data(key, value); } sometimes fails later when events fire (accessed with $(this)), however if I add element.attr('data-'+key, JSON.stringify(value)); it always works
[02:45:17] <Cork> ...
[02:45:20] <Cork> a TESTCASE!!!
[02:45:26] <BadCodSmell> I am not cloning anywhere
[02:45:32] <Cork> we need a testcase that shows the problem
[02:45:40] <BadCodSmell> At least not explicitely.
[02:46:53] <BadCodSmell> You don't strictly need a testcase.
[02:47:02] <BadCodSmell> YOU might for the way you provide help.
[02:47:21] <Cork> sigh
[02:47:41] <BadCodSmell> I had this before with a very small portion of code but now it's buried somewhere in thousands of lins
[02:47:55] <Anticom> BadCodSmell provide an example or look for help somewhere else
[02:48:48] <Anticom> problem seems to have solved itself...
[02:48:52] <Anticom> :D
[02:49:01] <Cork> idiot...
[02:49:53] <Ov3rTaf> hi
[03:06:11] <Sackyboy> hi! can someone help me with a problem regarding jquery and chrome issues. i've created a simple webpage that allows the user to push a button and then the soruce code appears in a textfield. this works in all different kind of web browser but not google chrome. does anyone know if i can add something to the code to get it to work in chrome as well?
[03:06:17] <Sackyboy> here's the code: http://jsfiddle.net/23tEV/
[03:09:17] <Cork> Sackyboy: what part isn't working?
[03:10:04] <Sackyboy> i can push the HTML button, and the soruce code for the HTML-content appears in the box. but when im pushing the css button or the jquery button, nothing happens in chrome
[03:10:08] <Sackyboy> it works in safari thoughÂ¨
[03:10:18] <Cork> Sackyboy: http://jsfiddle.net/23tEV/1/
[03:10:43] <Cork> that works for me in chrome
[03:10:54] <Cork> (for css and jquery that is, i have no html to link to)
[03:11:13] <Cork> hmm actually i do
[03:11:24] <Sackyboy> oh, okay
[03:11:30] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/23tEV/2/
[03:11:41] <Cork> Sackyboy: just to be clear, i only changed the urls for the sources
[03:12:30] <Sackyboy> okay, what exactly does url: '/css/normalize.css?SpringIsComing1', add? :)
[03:12:43] <Sackyboy> is springIsComing just some random text?
[03:12:47] <Cork> it links to a css file on jsfiddle
[03:13:00] <Cork> i copied it from the <link> tag
[03:14:01] <Sackyboy> okay, so the code did work for you even without any changes?
[03:14:17] <Cork> ya
[03:14:33] <Cork> i just enabled jquery, and changed the urls to existing resources
[03:16:12] <Sackyboy> okay, o thank you. so iguess it has to be online?
[03:16:37] <Sackyboy> im trying to run this page offline
[03:17:06] <Cork> it should work if the cache has the requested file
[03:17:24] <Sackyboy> thank you for your help, i will try some stuff here :)
[03:17:30] <Cork> but its a bit harder to say
[03:17:37] <Cork> Sackyboy: good luck
[03:19:46] <sahana> hello everyone, is there any jquery library for implementing xpath?
[03:20:46] <Cork> sahana: for implementing?
[03:21:04] <Cork> sahana: what is it you're trying to do?
[03:21:28] <sahana> xpath selectors?
[03:21:51] <sahana> i have to query xml file using xpath selectors
[03:22:02] <Cork> sahana: document.evaluate ?
[03:22:23] <Cork> sahana: css selectors can do the same things as xpath
[03:22:26] <Cork> and its normally faster
[03:22:37] <Cork> (much MUCH faster too)
[03:23:41] <sahana> similar to sarissa library. (cross-browser javascript library for xpath)
[03:23:43] <sahana> css selector work on css file. But i want to work on xml files
[03:24:03] <Cork> sahana: selectorAll works on xml files
[03:24:14] <Cork> selectorAll == css selectors
[03:24:40] <dleonardi> hey, i've got a domnode which is clicked (a checkbox to be specific) which is contained in a domnode which has an :active pseudo-class selector which styles it. I'm trying to capture events for onmousedown and click on the checkbox, and i'm blocking propagation and stopping the default event, but the :active pseudo-class still gets applied when i hold my mouse down on the checkbox
[03:24:48] <dleonardi> any idea how to block this behaviour?
[03:24:55] <Cork> sahana: and that means jquery can select in xml files just fine
[03:25:13] <Cork> as long as you write your selector based on css selectors
[03:25:15] <dleonardi> i've tried diagnosing it by checking all the events that are fired off that element, and onmousedown is indeed the culprit here.
[03:25:26] <sahana> do you have any link for the examples?
[03:26:05] <Cork> sahana: $(xml or xmldom).find('something you want to find')
[03:26:43] <Cork> dleonardi: can you try to reduce that question?
[03:26:52] <Cork> can't find your question in there
[03:27:10] <dleonardi> how do i block :active pseudo-classes from being applied ?
[03:27:28] <dleonardi> evt.preventDefault && evt.stopPropagation have no effect on the domNodes's onmousedown event
[03:27:30] <Cork> dleonardi: you define ex. a class in your css that override it
[03:27:37] <dleonardi> not going to happen.
[03:27:42] <dleonardi> i'm not modifying style for this.
[03:27:52] <Cork> then you can't
[03:27:58] <dleonardi> seriously?
[03:28:04] <dleonardi> why?
[03:28:14] <Cork> well you can define the default style manually through js
[03:28:24] <dleonardi> thats even worse.
[03:28:25] <Cork> and there by overriding the css rule with an inline css rule
[03:28:33] <Cork> ya, but those are your potions
[03:28:37] <dleonardi> why?
[03:28:45] <Cork> css is a markup, not a script
[03:28:49] <dleonardi> i can block anything else, whats so special about :active ?
[03:28:52] <Cork> it doens't react to js flow
[03:28:56] <sahana> thanks cork.. will check it out.
[03:29:18] <Cork> dleonardi: cause it reacts to if the element has focus and is pressed
[03:29:23] <Cork> and its separate from js
[03:29:54] <Cork> you don't control css from js, you set values that css uses
[03:31:17] <Sackyboy> Cork: do you know if you can load in more files (i.e. css, js etc) in the cache, if you want to run a page offline?
[03:32:01] <Cork> Sackyboy: if you request it while in online mode it should be stored in cache, as long as the cache isn't full
[03:32:25] <Cork> (and as long as you don't tell ajax to work around the cache)
[03:32:51] <Sackyboy> Cork: okay, but if you are running it offline, is it more tricky to do that?
[03:33:14] <Cork> Sackyboy: you wold have to get the user to go out of offline mode
[03:33:15] <dleonardi> Cork: thanks. this sure is bad though. dont know if i like this behaviour.
[03:33:33] <Cork> dleonardi: there isn't really a way around it
[03:34:09] <dleonardi> yah i'm noticing. i'll just end up adding another class which overrides the :active state, but that will end up creating a nice flimmering effect for a fraction of a second
[03:34:32] <dleonardi> because onmousedown is both the trigger for the active state and the changing of classes
[03:34:37] <Cork> dleonardi: just add the class when you add the event listner
[03:34:45] <Cork> and be done with it
[03:34:59] <dleonardi> that wont work
[03:35:03] <Cork> sure it will
[03:35:15] <dleonardi> no, because i need the :active pseudo class when i click elsewhere
[03:35:16] <Sackyboy> Cork: Okay. As I see it, if im running the page offline, chrome reads the html file from cache, and can't get other source files into the textfield. But it's strange that it works in safari and firefox. But maybe the browser are created in different way..?
[03:35:23] <Cork> dleonardi: ex. selector:not(.js):active {}
[03:35:37] <dleonardi> wut?
[03:35:49] <dleonardi> oh, it can be active.
[03:36:03] <dleonardi> its a messy situation. best to solve this at UI level.
[03:36:40] <Cork> dleonardi: the css can sole it, as long as you have constructed the page correctly from the start at least
[03:37:01] <Cork> css should be in the css files, and if you are quite strict about that, its quite easy to get it working
[03:37:12] <dleonardi> 'tis
[03:37:20] <dleonardi> its just the UI thats wrong.
[03:37:35] <dleonardi> once thats adressed properly, this will go away too by itself.
[03:37:36] <dleonardi> :)

[03:40:15] <Cork> Sackyboy: it might very well be a bug in chrome, but i haven't looked at offline mode enough to tell

[03:56:46] <Elirips> Hello. I use '$.ajax({ url: file, dataType: "script", cache: false})' to load script when they are needed, everything is working. I use IE 9 and its Dev-Tools to debug things in IE from time-to-time. Unfortunately, if I load a srcting using .ajax, IE "forgets" its name and lists it as 'script block (some-number)', what is a little bit annyoing if you have dozends of scripts. Any possibility to assign a "name" to such a script?
[04:06:44] <WHTM> I'm loading an xml file using .ajax but can figure out how to use $(xml).find(.. outside of the success functionâ¦ any help would be greatly appreciated http://jsfiddle.net/rh863/
[04:08:33] <WHTM> Infact I want to use the data outside .ajax
[04:10:14] <ravenzz> ?parseXML @ WHTM
[04:12:32] <WHTM> Isn't that for creating an xml file from a string?
[04:12:43] <WHTM> Or have I misunderstood it?
[04:13:12] <WHTM> I have an xml file, which has a few sub sections
[04:13:39] <ravenzz> yep it parses a string into an xml doc
[04:15:53] <WHTM> I don't think I really understand how to use it then.. as I already have a doc with with all the data in it and I would like to get the data out.. Without having to run my whole site in the success function of .ajax
[04:16:25] <WHTM> As I was lead to believe running the whole site in the success function isn't a good thing to do

[04:32:41] <cheshair> Hi! I have some jquery code I am loading from head section. What's the jquery preferred method to "defer" its loading, so that my whole dom is ready when the js is read?
[04:32:57] <cheshair> What about $(document).ready()?
[04:33:22] <cheshair> or just a wrapping everything inside a $(...my code here...) ?
[04:33:30] <cheshair> s/a //
[04:33:37] <WHTM> I use $(document).ready()
[04:34:09] <xec> cheshair: $(function(){}) is a shorthand for $(document).ready(function(){})
[04:34:40] <cheshair> WHTM, xec: nice thank you very much! I'll go for the document/ready pair then :-)
[04:49:05] <anew> so i'm sending an ajax request with url /category/1/2/3.  on the page i send it to i var dump(1) and it comes back null ?
[04:49:31] <anew> all the data i send via POST i can see
[04:49:37] <anew> but the data in the url is null, anyone have any ideas ?
[04:50:09] <xec> anew: sounds like a PHP question, really, if you can verify that the URL is correct in the http request
[04:50:30] <xec> (assuming PHP is your server side lang)
[04:50:32] <anew> yeah just thought since i was sending it via ajax it was for #jq
[04:50:35] <anew> yes it's php
[04:50:49] <anew> yes url is correct, i can send and recieve data
[04:50:55] <anew> does it have to do with the ajax type?
[04:51:04] <anew> because it is 'post' can parts of the url not be read ?
[04:52:01] <ravenzz> it depends on your server side logic
[04:52:52] <anew> so type:post has nothing to do with that
[04:52:57] <anew> if i set type:post and try to send get
[04:53:03] <anew> will that error
[04:54:50] <xec> anew: http method should have little to do with reading the URL
[04:54:59] <anew> hmmm ok
[04:55:30] <anew> i mean i can solve all this by just creating a hidden input and sending it via ajax instead of url
[04:55:36] <anew> but just curious why url wont work
[04:55:47] <xec> what do you mean by "ajax instead of url"
[04:55:49] <anew> for knowledge
[04:56:35] <anew> 'by ajax' i mean send what i want by using something like rating = $("#stara").val();
[04:56:37] <xec> ajax requests are, just like other http requests, done using a url
[04:56:48] <anew> and then send data: rating
[04:56:53] <anew> that will work
[04:57:06] <anew> but if i do mysite.com/star/
[04:57:10] <anew> it will not
[04:58:04] <xec> i can't make much sense of this, could you show us your code?
[04:58:20] <anew> yeah definitely one second
[05:00:27] <jaydev> hi .. I am getting a problem while returning array from a javascript function
[05:00:47] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/4bbNx/
[05:00:48] <anew> xec
[05:01:05] <anew> so data gets sent, i can see it and use it server side
[05:01:16] <anew> but url: everything in there turns up null
[05:01:24] <anew> and the url that is being sent is what is commented out on line 16
[05:01:27] <anew> so there are values there
[05:01:29] <jaydev> this is the code for that js
[05:01:30] <jaydev> http://jsfiddle.net/zAU3y/
[05:01:37] <xec> anew: and how are you reading the URL?
[05:01:58] <xec> anew: i.e how are you attempting to retrieve the country id
[05:02:44] <anew> hmmm i'm using a framework server side... so that would definitely be a question for them i guess.  i am using codeigniter and just reading the parameters being passed
[05:02:58] <seutje> jaydev: is gethobbies suppose to return san?
[05:03:04] <anew> i will go ask them ?
[05:03:23] <jaydev> yes
[05:03:37] <seutje> jaydev: you can't have a synchronous function return stuf fasynchronously
[05:03:42] <seutje> stuff asynchronously*
[05:04:13] <jaydev> so how can i get the values from function gethobbies?
[05:04:44] <jaydev> it shows me undefined
[05:04:48] <seutje> jaydev: you can pass it a function to be executed with san as argument
[05:06:18] <seutje> jaydev: or use a deferred
[05:06:30] <jaydev> sorry but I dont know how to do that ..
[05:06:44] <seutje> jaydev: see http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide42
[05:06:52] <jaydev> ok let me see
[05:07:25] <seutje> jaydev: gnarf posted a rather nice example on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7779697/javascript-asynchronous-return-value-assignment-with-jquery
[05:08:07] <jaydev> ok
[05:09:42] <mhn23> can somebody refer me a nice introduction into jQuery? i'm looking forward to learn it but i don't know anything about javascript or very few things from codeacademy.
[05:10:20] <xec> anew: quick'n'dirty fix would be to include them as data parameters as well as in the url, i guess ;)
[05:10:37] <anew> yeah xec that is the fastest
[05:10:42] <anew> i will do that, dont want to spend all day on this
[05:11:05] <mhn23> what i want to do is learning jQ itself. for me using js itself is like building websites in tables when jQ can do it with div's
[05:11:22] <Schonert> I'm working on a link expander. In short, it comes with additional information about a link when press. I need an effective way to close it when the body is clicked. Any suggestions?
[05:13:05] <xec> mhn23: jquery is a javascript library - meaning you really need to know how javascript works in order to use it
[05:13:23] <xec> ?learn
[05:13:23] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[05:14:08] <xec> mhn23: and when i say "javascript" i don't neccessarily mean the DOM API :P
[05:15:32] <jehee> Why wont this simple hover work? http://jsfiddle.net/8Gfut/
[05:16:00] <ravenzz> because you forgot to include jQueyrt
[05:16:07] <boytoy> Hey which one would you guys choose? https://github.com/tegansnyder/JQuery-Mobile-Slide-Menu of https://github.com/acolangelo/jPanelMenu ?
[05:16:08] <ravenzz> from the framework panel
[05:16:12] <boytoy> * or
[05:17:47] <jehee> jehee it is included
[05:17:53] <jehee> I saw no point in including it in jsfiddle
[05:17:57] <jehee> ravenzz*
[05:18:20] <xec> jehee: it isn't
[05:18:30] <xec> it works if you include jquery :P
[05:18:49] <jehee> haha ooh you...
[05:18:58] <jehee> I included some angulus js from google api
[05:19:17] <xec> not in the jsfiddle you didn't
[05:19:37] <jehee> in my code I Did

[05:29:19] <Schonert> Well.. Helping them shows that you are smarter..
[05:32:41] <seutje> Schonert: assert will actually throw an error

[05:49:08] <paul_> hi, i am having probs downloading jQuery from the jQuery website, all it gives me is a page of code. Anyone know how to download this?
[05:50:10] <Cork> paul_: right click and save as...
[05:50:11] <aMoniker> paul_: File > Save As
[05:50:13] <JSharpe> paul_, have you tried File>Save/Save Page As etc
[05:50:24] <aMoniker> or copy paste it into your own file :D
[05:51:45] <paul_> thanks guys, I have tried this and get a Windows Script Host message saying 'window' is undefined :(
[05:51:59] <Cork> O_o
[05:52:06] <Cork> you clicked run and not save?
[05:52:37] <Cork> wsscript is the default program for .js files
[05:53:08] <paul_> it only gives me the option to 'Save link as'
[05:59:19] <reloadz> hi! I have <div id=aaa><select></></><div id=dsa><select></></><div id=asd><select></></>! I can make selector that on change append element in parent, but i need to append streight away apter the parent - i need to insert code in the same level as parent
[05:59:52] <reloadz> after*
[06:00:06] <reloadz> how can i make that selector?
[06:00:22] <aMoniker> insertAfter()
[06:00:44] <aMoniker> or after()
[06:00:51] <aMoniker> depending on which way you're looking at it
[06:04:52] <Koruptdeath> hey guys-- if i want to use a separate .js file for my scripts i just reference it after the main jquery .js file right?
[06:05:14] <aMoniker> Koruptdeath: yes
[06:05:30] <Koruptdeath> thank you-- looks like i messed something else up
[06:26:22] <Dev0n> how would I get the event of the initial selector? ie. $(something).delegate(...), the event for "something"
[06:26:29] <Dev0n> taking the event from function inside delegate only gives the event for that delgate and not the inital selector
[06:27:18] <aMoniker> Dev0n: .delegate() is deprecated, use .on()
[06:27:52] <Dev0n> ahh
[06:29:49] <Dev0n> done
[06:30:30] <msoa> This code is correct? $('#update-button').remove;
[06:30:31] <msoa> '#update-button' is a button.
[06:32:19] <hcker2000> Any one know how to programatically prevent a panel from opening from the panelbeforeopen event?

[06:48:17] <motaka2> hello why this piece of code is wrong?   http://pastebin.com/25YVajbg  - it seems doesnt go in the each function
[06:48:19] <meafure> Hello
[06:48:38] <motaka2> meafure: Hello
[06:49:08] <Cork> motaka2: wrong in what way?
[06:49:15] <meafure> Is it possible to load a local javascript file on top of a website ?
[06:49:49] <motaka2> Cork: inputes is not empty but alert or console.log wouldnt invoke any thing -
[06:49:55] <Cork> meafure: depends, if you have a priviliged loaded (in the browser) you can load it
[06:50:11] <Cork> meafure: else its normally simplest to just inject the entire script text
[06:50:26] <Cork> motaka2: in the each loop?
[06:50:33] <motaka2> Cork: yesy
[06:50:35] <Cork> and inputs.length is?
[06:51:04] <motaka2> Cork: Something none zero
[06:51:33] <politie> hello
[06:51:44] <meafure> Cork: My javascript file fil checkbox and radiobuttons. I would like to fil automatically a form via this javascript file. I have an administrator access to my browser.
[06:52:11] <Cork> meafure: so userscript or booklets sounds like the simplest solution
[06:52:29] <meafure> Cork: Ok, gonna search more informations about them, thanks :)
[06:52:40] <Cork> meafure: np
[06:52:43] <motaka2> Cork: I fixed it using your alert - thank you
[06:57:16] <politie> does anyone know how this can be done better? http://jsfiddle.net/dPgrn/31/ . i want 5 combined divs to have hover events as one. i cant pass parameters to the hover functions..
[06:57:40] <politie> so 10 divs, 5 hover events.
[06:59:55] <Cork> politie: set the class it should add in a data- attribute
[07:00:02] <Cork> and then you can do it all in one handler
[07:01:01] <politie> but will they work individually then?
[07:01:02] <Cork> politie: also whats suppose to happen with the last two?
[07:01:12] <Cork> not sure what you mean individually
[07:01:24] <Cork> events is per dom event
[07:01:33] <politie> i didnt get that far, i see the class en ids are still a bit weird.
[07:01:51] <Cork> also $('.bal1').addClass('superTonkie'); $('.bak1').addClass('ultraTonkie'); can be combined to $('.bal1').addClass('superTonkie ultraTonkie');
[07:01:58] <politie> i want each colored block to have 1 hover event
[07:02:17] <Cork> ok?
[07:02:34] <Cork> why do they need to have separate handlers?
[07:03:14] <Cork> (just noticed that they all do the same thing)
[07:03:50] <politie> if i do a general class they will all do the event at the same time
[07:04:04] <Cork> uh
[07:04:05] <Cork> what?
[07:04:24] <Cork> the event will happen on the element no matter how many listeners you add
[07:04:58] <Cork> politie: this does the same thing as your old code http://jsfiddle.net/dPgrn/33/
[07:05:54] <politie> ok like that
[07:06:20] <Cork> ah opps
[07:06:22] <Cork> sorry typo
[07:06:50] <politie> where
[07:06:53] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/dPgrn/34/
[07:07:01] <Cork> missed the comma in the selector :)
[07:07:58] <Cork> ah... no i miss read yor code
[07:08:00] <politie> ok but using this was my problem, it wont add to bal and bak at the same time
[07:08:01] <Cork> *your
[07:08:14] <Cork> ya, i missed that the classes isn't the same
[07:08:30] <Cork> ok, can you add more classes to the elements?
[07:08:42] <politie> yea
[07:08:47] <Cork> hmm no that won't help
[07:08:58] <Cork> give me a sec to think about this
[07:09:42] <Cork> politie: can the elements be grouped with a parent?
[07:10:14] <Cork> ex <div class="bal-bak"><div class="bal"></div><div class="bak"></div></div>
[07:10:27] <seutje> politie: are u a cop?
[07:10:31] <constantin_mike> lol
[07:11:06] <politie> they can be grouped but eventually i want the top div to do something different then the bottom one
[07:11:52] <Cork> politie: i was thinking about doing something like $(this).closest('tonkie-wrapper').addClass('hovered')
[07:12:05] <Hermiene> I want a little thingy that says "Saved!" with green text and whatnot when the user clicks Save. What's a good way to go about this?
[07:12:19] <Cork> and then do .tonkie-wrapper.hover .bak {} / .tonkie-wrapper.hover .bal {}
[07:12:24] <Hermiene> Looking for a timed thingy which shows() and hides() the content
[07:12:25] <Cork> politie: ^
[07:13:23] <Cork> Hermiene: $('#notice').show(300).delay(5000).hide(300)
[07:13:41] <Hermiene> Oh! Awesome
[07:13:42] <Cork> and then just style the #notice in your css
[07:13:45] <Hermiene> Thanks Cork
[07:13:49] <Cork> np
[07:13:53] <Hermiene> Gotta love method chaining :)
[07:27:47] <politie> thanks alot Cork, i got it working now
[07:28:01] <Cork> politie: did it clean up the code a bit?
[07:28:07] <politie> yep
[07:28:09] <Cork> nice
[07:28:47] <hcker2000> Any one know how to programatically prevent a panel from opening from the panelbeforeopen event?

[07:29:26] <granden_> http://beta.actesupply.se/belysning.php?id=3 - Anyone who can help me figure out why my slider doesn't work?
[07:30:15] <Cork> granden_: side note, your html is invalid
[07:31:05] <granden> Cork: Why is that?
[07:31:14] <Cork> granden: you have <form> inside your <table> but outside <td>
[07:31:40] <Cork> granden: only direct child allowed in <table> is <thead> <tbody> <tfood> and <tr>
[07:32:36] <Cork> granden: about the slider, your giving it strings
[07:32:41] <ravenzz> hcker2000 close it?
[07:32:44] <xec> you're*
[07:32:50] <Cork> GAH
[07:32:54] <xec> :D :D
[07:33:09] <Cork> i've been looking at them all day trying to catch them all...
[07:33:13] <granden> Cork: Doh, ok changing that :)
[07:33:57] <Cork> well better but still...
[07:34:41] <Cork> granden: ah, you can't combine max and values (unless my memory fails me)
[07:35:06] <hcker2000> ravenzz, I would prefer to prevent it from opening so the flow of the app is not effected
[07:35:11] <Cork> granden: try adding a few more options in the values array
[07:35:19] <granden> Cork: Hmm
[07:35:23] <hcker2000> basically I have a panel that is dependent on the user being loged in
[07:35:40] <Cork> granden: or remove the values array all together
[07:35:49] <hcker2000> so if there not loged ing and they click it it will prompt them to login and then once thats done open the panel
[07:35:55] <ravenzz> hcker2000 yep but beforeopen is "triggered at the start of the process of opening a panel"
[07:36:17] <granden> Cork: Removing it gives me this,
[07:36:27] <granden> removed
[07:36:40] <granden> then only one, not a range slider
[07:36:41] <Cork> granden: weird
[07:37:02] <Cork> granden: ya, and you still can't drag the slider...
[07:37:13] <hcker2000> ravenzz, ok is there a way to prevent the default action on the link that opens the panel and then programatically open the panel
[07:37:30] <granden> got a worknig slider here, http://actesolutions.se/produkter/embedded/panel-pc
[07:37:32] <ravenzz> hcker2000 so if you want to prevent them to open it, you should work with the trigger rather then the panel I guess
[07:37:39] <granden> but can't spot what I have done differnetly
[07:37:41] <granden> Cork: *
[07:38:26] <hcker2000> ravenzz, well the panel triggers are setup automataically when you have an href with #mypanel where #mypanel is the id of the panel
[07:38:51] <hcker2000> so I may need to break that and setup my own handler for that particular button
[07:39:19] <hcker2000> unless you know a way to hook into the code that automatically setups that handler
[07:39:32] <Cork> granden: you get a closestHandle missing error
[07:39:44] <granden> What is that?
[07:40:25] <Cork> granden: a reference to the ui-slider-handle element
[07:40:35] <Cork> not sure why that one fails...
[07:41:07] <granden> Downloaded an old version of jquery ui from the other server. Perhaps downloading a newer version of ui
[07:41:24] <ravenzz> hcker2000 you can prevent the auto bind iirc
[07:41:38] <Cork> granden: try reproducing the error on jsfiddle when you're at it
[07:41:43] <hcker2000> ravenzz, how so?
[07:43:30] <cli> anyone wish to help with a more particular problem ?
[07:43:40] <Cork> granden: that section of the code seams to work fine in fiddle at least http://jsfiddle.net/eXFJ4/

[07:47:18] <Cork> granden: time to start dissecting the dependencies of the page :)
[07:47:29] <granden> Cork: Yeah :)
[07:48:05] <granden> Cork: Could you try it now?
[07:48:05] <granden> http://beta.actesupply.se/belysning.php?id=3
[07:48:09] <didiergm> hello. Why I am not getting anything in 'c' when doing this
[07:48:09] <didiergm> c=$();
[07:48:17] <granden> Now if I press on the slider it works. But not draging the boxes
[07:48:31] <didiergm> var fld = $('<input />'); c.append(fld);
[07:48:41] <didiergm> c is still empty ?
[07:49:17] <chinoto> I didn't realize I could say $('b').filter('#a .c'), I was using a function to see if an element was a descendant of another. (dunno where I did that, but I did...)
[07:50:13] <Cork> granden: works
[07:50:27] <granden> Even to drag the small boxes?
[07:50:44] <suppp> hi, i'm trying to understand, based on what criteria does the success callback of the $.ajax object get called ? I have a piece of test code, the server returns json, the $.ajax().always() callback gets called , but the .success() doesn't get called. Threads on sourceforge suggest that this .success() gets called based on the HTTP status code, but in that case , it should get called in my scenario . Can anybody clarify this for me please ?
[07:51:36] <chinoto> suppp: you might not be receiving a valid type data
[07:51:55] <Cork> granden: you mean the lampa 1A things?
[07:51:58] <ravenzz> hcker2000 I don't remember tbh, I have used jQuery mobile only once. but what is wrong with ui.panel.panel('close'); ?
[07:52:07] <cli> anyone can help me?
[07:52:14] <granden> Cork: No the knots
[07:52:17] <granden> on the slider
[07:52:21] <suppp> chinoto: so what's a valid type data then ? what is the criteria for success to be called ?
[07:52:50] <Cork> granden: those where the ones that i meant works
[07:52:52] <hcker2000> ravenzz, I think what will end up happening is that it will open and then close which could be confusing to users but I can give it a try in the event method I have setup to see what happens
[07:53:00] <Cork> cli: you should't use attribute selectors on id's
[07:53:02] <ravenzz> hcker2000 or attach another event handler to the link?
[07:53:07] <moxie_> Hey guys, the following selector (https://gist.github.com/85a8fad2c763e24511a1) is throwing an error in IE7 ~ is that selector in anyway malformed? No issues in any other browserâ¦ Weird as hell right?
[07:53:21] <chinoto> suppp: well if you're wanting json data, then the server has to set content-type to "application/json"
[07:53:26] <ravenzz> hcker2000 that shouldn't happen I think
[07:53:26] <alaing> Hi , I'm creating a plugin using the jQuery UI Widget Factory. I'm trying to create+ set a new option but it doesn't seem to be creating it . http://pastebin.com/jLRagUK1
[07:53:32] <Cork> cli: its slow and a BAD idea cause you lose all the browsers optimizations for classes and id's
[07:53:36] <alaing> look on the last line
[07:53:45] <chinoto> otherwise jquery thinks it is wrong and triggers the error function
[07:53:49] <hcker2000> ravenzz, thats plan B :D but im going to give the panel('close') method a try first
[07:53:56] <suppp> hmm chinoto, ok that makes sense, i'll set that and see
[07:54:19] <chinoto> suppp: are you looking for json?
[07:54:46] <cli> Cork: solution ?
[07:54:48] <suppp> chinoto: I want json , not sure what you mean by "are you looking"
[07:54:53] <Cork> cli: use classes
[07:55:08] <Cork> cli: add a class for grouping the elements you want, and then select on the class/classes
[07:55:11] <cli> Cork I tried, it simple doesn't work on any event/class
[07:55:24] <ravenzz> hcker2000 or this http://jsfiddle.net/hkeUL/
[07:55:45] <chinoto> suppp: I guess that is confusing, I was just verifying that you were meaning to get json from the server.
[07:55:45] <ravenzz> true is your condition of course
[07:55:47] <moxie_> Also, if I don't chain the selectors via the commaâ¦ there is no issue at all
[07:55:56] <cli> Cork: the html is at it is, it is generated by that cms. ALL i want is to add my own js function on click/etc
[07:55:56] <Cork> cli: $(document).on('click mousedown', '.sel-class1, .sel-class2', function() {});
[07:55:58] <kracekumar_> I am trying convert string to json using parseJSON, but that isn't happening string startswith #&34; which is double quote, unexpected symbol & is what I get as error in console
[07:56:08] <ravenzz> hcker2000 oops -return ;)
[07:56:15] <cli> k Ill try thatone too
[07:56:22] <hcker2000> ravenzz, .panel('close') does not work let me give your other idea a try
[07:56:38] <suppp> chinoto: the response headers have this : Content-Type	application/json; charset=utf-8 . still the success call back $.ajax().done() doesn't get called
[07:56:42] <chinoto> suppp: I constantly forget to throw "header('Content-type: application/x-javascript');" in my code so that jquery accepts it.
[07:57:05] <chinoto> you sure charset should be there?
[07:57:21] <Cork> charset is allowed, but not needed
[07:57:22] <chinoto> oh wait, that's a separate one, nvm
[07:57:25] <ravenzz> hcker2000 .panel('close') should work though. I would like to suggest you namespaced events... like click.mycustomstuff so you can remove it at any time
[07:57:32] <suppp> chinoto : i havn't taken control over it yet, it's what rails returns by default when i tell it to render json
[07:57:42] <Cork> chinoto: no its actually the said one
[07:58:35] <Cork> suppp: application/json is correct if you actually send json back
[07:58:43] <granden> Cork: Ok, strange. I can't drag em. Only press on the slider. But ok. Thanks.
[07:58:51] <chinoto> Cork: what I meant was that it wasn't part of the same header ... field?
[07:59:00] <Cork> granden: heh the slider clicking doesn't work for me :)
[07:59:28] <Cork> chinoto: it is the header fields is separated by line break \r\n
[07:59:44] <chinoto> actually nvm, I don't know wtf I'm talking about :D
[08:00:08] <Cork> chinoto: ; in the header is quite common to separate values on the same header
[08:00:14] <hcker2000> ravenzz, its not even letting me add another event listener to the button that opens the panel
[08:01:19] <Cork> suppp: also, success/done is only called if the parsing doesn't fail
[08:01:24] <ravenzz> hcker2000 do you have link?
[08:01:49] <hcker2000> ravenzz, unfortunittly I do not let me see if I can get some thing together in a jsfiddle real quick here
[08:02:35] <suppp> Cork, chinoto : https://gist.github.com/kosz/5134838 I made this gist, showing my response headers , FULL json ( yes that's the full json I have , to simplify things ) , and the code that i use to call this
[08:03:35] <Cork> suppp: what about ajax.fail ?
[08:03:37] <ravenzz> hcker2000 what would be fine
[08:03:54] <suppp> good point , i'll code that in as well, i didnt have it writen
[08:05:02] <suppp> Cork : ajax.fail doesn't get called. ajax.done doesn't get called. only ajax.always gets called :O
[08:05:17] <Cork> ?!?
[08:05:32] <cli> Cork: thanks It worked for the first button. When clicked on this button it adds one more row of fields, removes this button and adds another. How can I trigger any of those buttons?
[08:05:41] <suppp> weird right
[08:05:52] <chinoto> suppp: shouldn't the functions be arguments of done() and always(), not assigned to them?
[08:06:03] <cli> example is http://dev1.kdoexpress.net/node/add/facture
[08:06:10] <Cork> cli: you mean trigger a click on the through code?
[08:06:13] <chinoto> strange that it works for always anyway
[08:06:14] <alaing> Hi , I'm creating a plugin using the jQuery UI Widget Factory. I'm trying to create+ set a new option but it doesn't seem to be creating it . http://pastebin.com/jLRagUK1
[08:06:16] <alaing> look on the last line
[08:06:31] <Cork> chinoto: its coffiescript
[08:06:36] <Cork> it like to mess with you like that :)
[08:07:05] <chinoto> then why is he here?
[08:07:25] <cli> Cork: it looks like it does generate the html via ajax and that event click I did doesn't work for any additional rows(button) except firstone
[08:07:35] <hcker2000> ravenzz, check out http://jsfiddle.net/FYYvG/
[08:07:36] <Cork> chinoto: coffiescript is a preprocessor that lets you write javascript with another syntax
[08:07:46] <Cork> chinoto: it then converts it to javascript server side
[08:08:06] <hcker2000> notice that my event binding does not fire when you click the profile button
[08:08:11] <Cork> chinoto: in other words its still javascript (sortof) and he's still using jquery
[08:08:14] <chilversc_> how do you handle page specific javascript for jquery mobile without having that javascript execute multiple times?
[08:08:17] <chinoto> weird
[08:08:33] <Cork> chinoto: ya, i'm no fan of coffiescript either
[08:08:38] <cli> Cork: Each time I click "Ajouter un autre Ã©lÃ©ment" I need to execute my function. Any idea where the bug is?
[08:08:40] <chilversc_> if I put the script outside the <div data-role="page"> element it never gets executed if the page is loaded via ajax
[08:08:58] <chilversc_> but if I put the script inside the page element, it gets executed every time the page is loaded via ajax
[08:09:21] <Cork> cli: in what file is that function defined?
[08:09:21] <cli> http://dev1.kdoexpress.net/node/add/facture & http://dev1.kdoexpress.net/sites/default/files/js_injector/js_injector_1.js
[08:09:41] <cli> in that js_injector_1.js
[08:09:49] <suppp> Cork , chinoto : WEIRD indeed.  Chinoto was right, my cofeescript sintax was wrong, and for some strange reason always was working with the wrong syntax :) I was indeed declaring a function as done, instead of sending a parameter to done
[08:09:50] <cli> you will see the alert on click
[08:10:02] <cli> but only once :(
[08:10:27] <suppp> Thanks guys for your input, it would have taken me quite a while to spot that on my own :) indeed cofeescript can get confusing :d
[08:10:39] <Cork> cli: you mean calculfacture?
[08:10:46] <chinoto> suppp: yay I said something partially right, even though I didn't realize what I was looking at
[08:11:36] <chilversc_> do I have to just set a data value to mark that my initializer for that page has already executed?
[08:11:37] <suppp> hah yea, u were in fact spot on. seriously i had to get my head closer to the monitor making sure that things are in the right place, coffescript has gotten very confusing in this particular instance hehe
[08:12:11] <suppp> either way the BIG problem was the always getting called with the wrong syntax and making this more confusing than they should have been
[08:12:18] <cli> Cork, yes after I will be able to trigger that on click event each time I click that button I will execute calculfacture. button is triggered just once now by this code:Query('.field-add-more-submit').on('click mousedown', function(e) {
[08:12:19] <cli> alert('class.on.mouse works');
[08:12:19] <cli> });
[08:12:33] <chilversc_> or should I initialize the page in a different way? currently hooking a live event on the document; eg $(document).on('pageinit', '[data-id=foo]', function() { ... });
[08:12:42] <cli> *jQuery..
[08:13:06] <Cork> cli: you're probably replacing the element, but your using a none delegated event listener
[08:13:17] <ladislaw> .html(val) is giving me "Nan" inside the node
[08:13:35] <Cork> ladislaw: where does val come from?
[08:13:45] <chilversc_> though I also havn't worked out what to do in jqm if you miss the init event, since it doesn't perform any sort of catch up
[08:14:24] <cli> Cork: probably the cms is replacing the element, TRUE, in fact I think it removes the old button and adds a new one when adding a new row of items. What exacly is delgated? how can I trigger each generated button that has same class?
[08:14:55] <Cork> cli: delegate means adding the listener on a parent, and then asking to listen for events from a child
[08:15:10] <Cork> $('parent').on('event', 'delegated event selector', function() {})
[08:15:12] <cli> Cork: did so, .field-add-more-submit is a parent
[08:15:27] <Cork> cli: and it's not replaced too?
[08:15:31] <ladislaw> Cork: part of it comes from function param
[08:16:08] <cli> Cork: well it looks like on parent it doesnt work at all
[08:16:18] <cli> in that js file you see all my atempts to make it work
[08:16:55] <cli> errm #edit-field-facture-items is a parent, tried already
[08:16:57] <BillyJoe> Using jquery-mobile, What are the best practices for indicating that form input is invalid? (Like 'incorrect username or password')
[08:18:08] <ladislaw> i see what the problem is...
[08:19:26] <ravenzz> hcker2000 seems to be an issue only when you do event delegation http://jsfiddle.net/FYYvG/1/
[08:20:36] <ravenzz> and of course there is no tap event on desktops
[08:20:51] <ravenzz> unless you have a touch screen
[08:24:52] <moxie_> IE7 chokes on this selectorâ¦ does it look like there is anything wrong with it? => $("form[data-remote-live='true'] input[type='radio'], form[data-remote-live='true'] input[type='checkbox']")
[08:26:55] <BillCriswell> moxie_: That looks like it should be fine.
[08:26:57] <chilversc_> moxie_: not really, you could simplyify it though with; $('form[data-remote-live=true]').find('input[type=radio], input[type=checkbox]')
[08:27:30] <moxie_> chilversc_: Be that as it may, the original paste SHOULD be valid right?
[08:27:40] <chilversc_> yup
[08:27:41] <moxie_> BillCriswell: my though exactlyâ¦ IE7 chokesâ¦
[08:27:52] <moxie_> crazy weird;
[08:28:38] <hcker2000> ravenzz, interesting that it dosnt work with event delegation
[08:28:40] <chilversc_> does jquery mobile have a function to test if a page has already been initialized?
[08:28:43] <hcker2000> every thing else seems to
[08:28:49] <chilversc_> ie, to test if the pageinit event has already run for that page
[08:29:48] <cli> Cork: any idea what should I do ?
[08:34:14] <cli> Cork: Evrika, I think I found the fix :)
[08:34:22] <cli> thanks a lot anyways! :)
[08:36:07] <Grundell> Hello,
[08:36:43] <Grundell> Is there a smart way to set the number of "checkboxes" you're allowed to check depending on what device you're on?
[08:38:17] <chinoto> According to (http://api.jquery.com/jquery/#selector-context) "$(a,b)" is equivalent to "$(b).find(a)", but that does not appear to be strictly correct when using the element creation syntax for "a": "$(document).find('<b>blah</b>')" and "$($('<b>blah</b>'),document)". The latter form should also trigger the unrecognized expression error, return no elements, or be a shortcut for append(), rather than ignoring the second argument.
[08:39:20] <hoangelos> so, is it normal that after using $('#selector').html(dom); that a button (that's not a submit button), and previously had a listener attached is now suddenly acting like a submit.
[08:39:44] <hoangelos> so it's acting like the jQuery listeners reloaded after the .html() call
[08:40:33] <chinoto> hoangelos: you'll probably have to make a jsfiddle/jsbin to demonstrate
[08:40:48] <Brodingo> hoangelos if its a newly added element and youre not using delegation then yes
[08:41:00] <Brodingo> `api on @ hoangelos
[08:41:00] <b-ot> hoangelos: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:42:09] <ladislaw> Given this "this.trigger('keyPressed',{data: this.$node.val().length});" <-- how will you get the value of "data" from the function that triggered the event?
[08:42:42] <ladislaw> alert(data) is giving me [Object, Object]
[08:43:47] <softmanpetro> I have a    $('#cart').submit(function(event) { and inside it I want to return false only if the id of the element where I pressed submit is not cart ... how can I do it please
[08:43:59] <chinoto> ladislaw: the handler should specify a variable for the event variable, then you say event.data.data
[08:44:21] <chinoto> function(event) {event.data.data}
[08:44:33] <hoangelos> Brodingo: it's an element that exists within the block being replaced with .html().  And the same element with teh same ID is updated.
[08:45:57] <Brodingo> hoangelos yes so you need to use event delegation. instead of binding to the element you delegate with a parent element, check the second example in the .on() docs
[08:46:49] <softmanpetro> $('#cart').submit(function(event) { var el = $(event.target); console.log(el.attr("class")); is undefined
[08:47:13] <softmanpetro> but I pressed enter in a input with class qty
[08:50:55] <hoangelos> Brodingo: I think that's what is happening.  But I think the parent that's being bound to is the form itself.  And the click is just submitting, instead of triggering the event, which is what I'm complaining about.
[08:50:56] <jehee> $('#menu > li a').bind('mouseover', menu_open); I want to target the <a href=""></a> inside the #menu li, how can I do this
[08:52:05] <jehee> the example above did not work
[08:52:09] <Brodingo> hoangelos you should use .submit() form submission
[08:52:51] <xec> jehee: can't see anything wrong with it. what does the html look like?
[08:53:25] <jehee> <ul><li><a href="">test</a></li></ul> I want him to react when hovering the href not the li
[08:53:49] <MalMen> its possible with jquery send data to a page redirecting ?
[08:54:33] <MalMen> for example send POST -> foo.php but not with $.post, i want to redirect my window to that page
[08:54:45] <xec> jehee: where does the "#menu > " come from then?
[08:54:59] <jehee> oh <ul id="menu">
[08:55:04] <jehee> forgot that
[08:55:17] <NoiseEee> MalMen: <form target="foo.php">
[08:55:22] <xec> jehee: in that case it should work
[08:55:23] <NoiseEee> MalMen: sorry just action!
[08:55:44] <MalMen> yes, but i dont want to make that on form... i am complicating this
[08:55:53] <NoiseEee> MalMen: or you stick stuff into a cookie (or perhaps localstorage) and recall it on the next page.
[08:56:52] <jehee> xec I just presented the structure, code inc
[08:57:06] <MalMen> i will think in what i want and will try to explain it better in a bit
[08:57:10] <xec> jehee: presented?
[08:57:39] * xec is slightly confuzzled
[08:58:02] <jehee> Here is the code http://jsfiddle.net/mpJGm/1/
[08:58:22] <jehee> the current one there work. But it reacts on hovering li. As I said I want it to react on the a element inside the <li>
[08:59:46] <xec> jehee: the selector is working
[08:59:56] <xec> jehee: but the functions are expecting the <li>
[09:00:34] <xec> jehee: you could turn $(this).find("ul").. into $(this).closest("li").find("ul")...
[09:01:13] <xec> but the whole code looks slightly messy to me
[09:01:58] <xec> jehee: check out http://cherne.net/brian/resources/jquery.hoverIntent.html if you want delays when hiding
[09:15:45] <BillCriswell> Anyone happen to have some photos of a product ( or a link to one ) where it's basically the products from all angles?
[09:16:20] <BillCriswell> Basically just as if you were to rotate the product and snap a picture of it from like every 10 / 20 degrees
[09:21:03] <BillCriswell> Nevermind. Just going to create some numbered images lol
[09:22:49] <GeorgesLeYeti> Hi
[09:23:10] <GeorgesLeYeti> I have some problem with contextMenu
[09:23:14] <GeorgesLeYeti> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/428bf1917aff56cc962a
[09:24:09] <GeorgesLeYeti> When i put the raw value of item define in word dbl click into "items" define in context menu (juste like the exemple) it works
[09:24:36] <GeorgesLeYeti> but i don t find the way to define a variable for items
[09:24:45] <Cork> GeorgesLeYeti: uh, you define item in the dblcick but you send it in at the start
[09:24:50] <Cork> that won't work
[09:25:39] <Cork> GeorgesLeYeti: the dblclick event sets the value, so you need to call contentMenu from the callback
[09:25:44] <Cork> not the main code
[09:26:11] <joelogan> i've got 1000 images in a folder
[09:26:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I have quiz form with 5 questions... Each question has 3 possible answers in the form of a radio box using the same name for all 3 answers... Is there an effective way with jquery to immediately get all radio button selections?
[09:26:24] <joelogan> what's the best way to divide the day into 1000 segments and fade between these images accordingly?
[09:26:50] <Cork> ?.serializeArray @ ecky--ptang-zoob
[09:26:50] <bot-t> ecky--ptang-zoob, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[09:27:06] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: or $('input:selected')
[09:27:19] <Cork> sorry :checked not selected
[09:27:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cork: how would that work with giving the name of the radio
[09:27:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[09:28:15] <Cork> $('input[name="the-name"]:checked')
[09:28:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $('input[name=mystuff]:selected') ?
[09:28:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> are the double quotes needed?
[09:28:43] <Cork> no, but its a good rule to do it
[09:28:53] <Cork> so you don't get problem if theres [] or similar in there
[09:28:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I always use double quotes on the outside and single quotes inside
[09:29:01] <Cork> ah
[09:29:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> no problem?
[09:29:05] <Cork> if you use ' or " doesn't matter
[09:29:18] <Cork> as long as you quote the value for name
[09:29:23] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what if the number of questions is variable?
[09:29:23] <GeorgesLeYeti>  Cork: sorry to ask you that but how and where to call the callback (no very familiar with js)
[09:29:40] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: what do you mean?
[09:29:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> How would I get all selected answers for a dynamic number of questions, instead of 5
[09:30:13] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: i thought that was what we where talking about
[09:30:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> If i use: $('input[name=mystuff]:selected')
[09:30:37] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have to harcode the name
[09:30:40] <Cork> $("input[name='the-name']:checked").val() gives you the value of the answer
[09:30:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> while there can be 6, 7, 8... namesd
[09:31:17] <Cork> $('input:checked').each(function() { $(this).attr('name'), $(this).val() });
[09:31:24] <Cork> or like i linked to serializeArray
[09:31:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> O_o
[09:31:53] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: with that i meant in the each you will get the element in question
[09:31:56] <Cork> and its name
[09:32:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Maybe serialize is more clear
[09:32:23] <Cork> its prob what your looking for ya
[09:32:27] <Cork> ?serializeArray
[09:32:28] <bot-t> .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[09:32:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ty
[09:32:39] <bakers> Does JqueryUI have it's own channel
[09:32:45] <Cork> bakers: no
[09:32:50] <bakers> I have a weird UI issue...
[09:33:10] <Cork> GeorgesLeYeti: the callback is called when the event is triggered in the browser
[09:33:30] <bakers> I just upgraded my intranet to JQuery 1.9.1 and UI 1.10.1 and when I call dialog() I get this: http://www.perturb.org/tmp/jquery-ui-dialog-stripe.png
[09:33:31] <Cork> GeorgesLeYeti: in your case its when the user dblclick's the element
[09:33:43] <bakers> I get a weird white stripe across the middle, didn't happen in previous versions
[09:33:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cork: Ok, I serialized them, now I need to pass them to a php script
[09:34:02] <ecky--ptang-zoob> can I just pass the whole thing as a param?
[09:34:08] <Cork> yes
[09:34:27] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { data: $('form').serialize() });
[09:34:34] <ecky--ptang-zoob> sweet
[09:34:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> You pro
[09:35:19] <Cork> bakers: not sure what the problem is
[09:36:15] <jehee> xec thanks for the url, got it now. Anyway I have another question. Can I as the ddmenu is open, change colour of the 'li' that was hovered?
[09:37:36] <jehee> Would have to be something like $(this).hover pseudo .css('color','red');
[09:37:39] <bakers> Cork: It's not supposed to have that white stripe across the middle. The dialog() is modal, so all the background should be grayed out
[09:38:19] <Cork> AH
[09:38:24] <Cork> didn't even see that
[09:38:28] <bakers> I see it in FF and Chrome
[09:38:38] <bakers> if I make the dialog non modal obviously it's fine
[09:38:45] <Cork> bakers: have you inspected the dom to see what element that is?
[09:39:15] <Cork> looks like the cover screen doens't get the correct dimensions
[09:39:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Notice: Undefined index: quizparams :(
[09:39:33] <Cork> bakers: have you checked so your css is correct?
[09:39:49] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: what?
[09:39:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Whats wrong with this: http://pastebin.com/y118zwPV
[09:40:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> in PHP I do var_dump($_POST["quizparams"]);
[09:40:23] <bakers> Cork: It's not easily selectable, and the ui-widget-overlay is the right size
[09:40:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and it says undefined inde
[09:40:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> x
[09:41:05] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: you don't do it like that
[09:41:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Why not?
[09:41:57] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: var data = $('#quizform').serializeArray(); data.push({name: 'a', value: '<? echo $rightanswers; ?>'});
[09:42:12] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: cause jquery won't know how to convert it into a params string
[09:42:30] <Cork> a params string is name=value&name=value
[09:42:52] <Cork> or in some cases name[sumname]=value&name[sumname]=value
[09:43:04] <Cork> sumname==subname
[09:43:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what's the 'a' ?
[09:43:21] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: your .a
[09:43:39] <Cork> i just moved it into the params array
[09:44:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and data is quizparams?
[09:44:39] <Cork> data is whats later given to the data: option ya
[09:45:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ok, can you check if I have it right?
[09:45:21] <Cork> sorry?
[09:45:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I paste what I made
[09:45:28] <Cork> check where?
[09:45:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://pastebin.com/9vVfXCuF
[09:45:59] <Cork> no
[09:46:11] <Cork> you still have multi leveled params
[09:46:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> grlvml
[09:46:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Can you try it then?
[09:46:41] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: the array you give to data needs to be an array of objects with name and value
[09:46:44] <Cork> i did
[09:46:50] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: var data = $('#quizform').serializeArray(); data.push({name: 'a', value: '<? echo $rightanswers; ?>'});
[09:46:59] <Cork> $.ajax(url, { data: data })
[09:47:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob>  var quizparams = $('#quizform').serializeArray();
[09:47:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> 						quizparams.push({name: 'a', value: '<? echo $rightanswers; ?>'});
[09:47:32] <ecky--ptang-zoob> so that way?
[09:47:36] <Cork> yes
[09:47:52] <Cork> you can replace the 'a' with what ever you want it to be
[09:47:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I don't grasp it, but ok
[09:48:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok ty
[09:48:51] <ecky--ptang-zoob> well it still doesn't dump the value in pp
[09:48:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> php
[09:49:14] <Cork> $_POST['a']
[09:49:20] <Cork> should be the answer
[09:49:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh right
[09:49:40] <Cork> $_POST['the_other_field_names'] should have the other
[09:49:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> that works
[09:49:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you rock
[09:50:34] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: if you just want to inspect them all you can do var_dump($_POST);
[09:51:05] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but now I still don't have the answers that are selected
[09:51:32] <systemfault> o_O
[09:52:00] <systemfault> Then what did you get?
[09:52:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ah yes, they're serializeed
[09:52:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> This is in the post: > ah y
[09:52:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://pastebin.com/U0sSam3w
[09:53:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> it just says "on", but I need to know which of the 3 is selected
[09:55:34] <meese> Can I use load() to grab span contents instead of a div, then move onto the next span?
[09:55:34] <shoky> what does your form look like?
[09:57:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> well here's the whole thing: http://pastebin.com/2XV5JMvX
[09:57:37] <shoky> eh
[09:57:50] <shoky> why you gotta torture :\
[09:58:01] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I was hoping pastebin would format that haha
[09:58:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> sec
[09:58:25] <systemfault> Nicely formatted HTML
[09:59:24] <shoky> ecky--ptang-zoob put values on your radios..
[09:59:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> formatted: http://pastebin.com/cL3hQ6FV
[10:00:41] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What value?
[10:01:04] <shoky> the value you want to see if that option is selected... this is basic html dude
[10:02:03] <ecky--ptang-zoob> damn
[10:02:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> yeah, stupid
[10:02:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> thx
[10:03:10] <meese> Basically, I want to grab certain text within a span and put each different snippet of text in different locations in the new HTML doc. http://pastie.org/private/xtjwtwyakw4mfdbhvpydsw <-- example format of the doc I'll be pulling from
[10:03:20] <meese> I think load() might be the function I need to use.
[10:04:31] <ajpiano> meese: .load() is not what you need to use, load() is for fetching the contents of another resource and loading it into the DOM
[10:04:46] <ajpiano> you just want to use any of the manipulation methods, e.g., appendTo, prependTo() etc
[10:05:12] <meese> ajpiano "fetching the contents of another resource and loading it into the DOM" sounds like what I want to do, though.
[10:05:41] <ajpiano> so you don't just want to move a span that's on the page to somewhere else on the page?
[10:06:21] <meese> ajpiano: no, it's to a new doc, as stated above.
[10:06:26] <ajpiano> ok
[10:06:35] <ajpiano> well, you *can* use load but i probably wouldn't
[10:06:58] <ajpiano> seeing as you'll want a filtering step after the request but before the insertion, i'd just use regular $.ajax
[10:07:44] <ajpiano> $.ajax({url: "/stuff", success: function(data) {  $(data).find("span").appendTo("#somewhereElse");  });
[10:07:57] <meese> oooh
[10:07:59] <meese> cool
[10:08:58] <meese> ajpiano: can I do: [â¦]find("<span>ex1</span>")[â¦]  ?
[10:09:05] <ajpiano> that's not a selector
[10:09:07] <ajpiano> so no
[10:09:27] <meese> hmm
[10:09:29] <ajpiano> i mean, you can do .find("span:contains(ex1)") but
[10:09:43] <ajpiano> :contains is a shitty way to write a program
[10:09:48] <shoky> .find('span').first()  might work for you too
[10:09:54] <ajpiano> i reckon he probably wants something like
[10:10:00] <shoky> or .eq(index)
[10:10:25] <ajpiano> .find("span").each(function() { /*do something that reads something about the current span and puts it in the appropriate place */ });
[10:10:26] <meese> shoky, ajpiano: But I want to pull the data that's on the line -after- the span I'm looking for.
[10:10:36] <ajpiano> exactly ^^
[10:10:41] <meese> k
[10:10:58] <meese> thanks
[10:16:23] <beshoo> dear all i have a starnge problem with jQuery , "Some times" when i pass a JSON code to jQuery.parseJSON it retrun [object Object] but as string , i mean if i test the return valu with typeof m it show string but not opject !
[10:16:40] <beshoo> just on Chrome and safari
[10:18:19] <systemfault> beshoo: If you use alert like a beginner to verify then of course..
[10:19:02] <beshoo> alert(typeof status);
[10:20:03] <systemfault> Don't do that...
[10:20:20] <systemfault> open your javascript console and use console.log(status) instead
[10:20:25] <shoky> ?js 'cool object: ' + $.parseJSON('{"a":1}')
[10:20:28] <bot-t> shoky: "cool object: [object Object]"
[10:20:34] <GeorgesLeYeti> Cork: :'( Still stuck
[10:20:36] <GeorgesLeYeti> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/39149eaa98aa30bcdd22
[10:20:45] <brutalhonesty> beshoo, if you have access to the PHP sending the json back, if you include header('Content-Type: application/json'); in there, you don't have to run the parseJSON command, just for future reference
[10:20:47] <GeorgesLeYeti> This is not working
[10:21:31] <beshoo> check this code and see what it return
[10:21:31] <beshoo> http://justpaste.it/2613
[10:22:57] <Narhir> Hi
[10:23:18] <shoky> i think the problem is the name "status" used globally
[10:23:30] <shoky> he's changing window.status
[10:23:36] <shoky> which is a string
[10:23:46] <shoky> beshoo:  var status = $.parseJSON(...);
[10:23:55] <shoky> the 'var' being the important bit
[10:23:59] <Narhir> I have created that kind of simple jQuery .show .hide thingie..
[10:24:00] <Narhir> http://pastebin.com/CGaKHQp2
[10:24:31] <shoky> beshoo: and either way, stop using alert
[10:24:35] <Narhir> when I hvoer over my "small-block" popup shows up, but if I even move my cursor a little bit it starts jumping
[10:24:41] <Narhir> like.. it hides back and forward :(
[10:24:58] <Narhir> any ideas what I can do to prevent that
[10:25:04] <Narhir> it seems like it is common issue
[10:25:45] <jaagr> yo
[10:26:02] <veQue> curious, how many people here have a three monitor setup?
[10:26:15] <beshoo> so i have to change the value status
[10:26:17] <jaagr> veQue: I do
[10:26:24] <shoky> beshoo:  just add 'var'
[10:26:26] <jaagr> veQue: 4 actually
[10:26:50] <veQue> jaagr: cool i'm thinking of getting another video card
[10:26:51] <beshoo> Thank you :)
[10:26:55] <veQue> wow
[10:27:15] <veQue> four, all side by side?
[10:27:56] <jaagr> veQue: No I have 3 ligned up and one above horizontally
[10:28:09] <veQue> how much do you attribute it to productivity?
[10:28:28] <veQue> well at least three
[10:29:00] <jaagr> the top one isn't really necessary (spelling?) for me, I mainly use it for tailing logs etc.. tho I find it nice to have it there
[10:29:02] <veQue> i can never go back to one
[10:29:19] <veQue> ahh indeed
[10:29:38] <jaagr> I couldn't go back to using only one either.. minimum 2 :)
[10:29:39] <veQue> thanks, was just curious
[10:31:22] <Narhir> so.. guys any ideas why the div is showing.hiding back and forward when I use the jquery .show.hide ?;/
[10:31:34] <Narhir> insteda of just showing and then.. hiding after cursours movs out from the popup section ?;/
[10:31:35] <Narhir> help ?
[10:31:36] <Narhir> http://pastebin.com/CGaKHQp2
[10:32:04] <GeorgesLeYeti> any idea why my code is not working: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/39149eaa98aa30bcdd22
[10:32:25] <buzzsaw> GeorgesLeYeti: define not working :-)
[10:32:34] <buzzsaw> what should it do what is it not doing?
[10:32:55] <GeorgesLeYeti> ok
[10:33:03] <GeorgesLeYeti> it should open a contextMenu
[10:33:10] <GeorgesLeYeti> when user double click on tag word
[10:33:11] <jaagr> Narhir: Why don't you add that functionality by class isntead of being that specifid?
[10:33:18] <jaagr> s/specific
[10:33:52] <buzzsaw> what "is" it doing?
[10:34:04] <GeorgesLeYeti> nothing
[10:34:15] <GeorgesLeYeti> I have no error
[10:34:28] <GeorgesLeYeti> and when i double click nothing appear
[10:34:35] <buzzsaw> I dont know much about jquery yet but this looks helpful as a template http://medialize.github.com/jQuery-contextMenu/demo.html
[10:34:53] <Narhir> jaagr
[10:35:06] <Narhir> because if I would do tit that way and then  IWould hover over 1 item
[10:35:11] <Narhir> then all other items will show up
[10:35:15] <Narhir> what woul you suggest ?
[10:37:10] <buzzsaw> GeorgesLeYeti: this looks more useful http://www.webreference.com/programming/jquery/context-menu/index.html
[10:38:25] <jaagr> Narhir: You got your site live?
[10:39:08] <jaagr> Narhir: And I'd suggest adding a relational reference between the block and the popup
[10:39:26] <Narhir> jaagr no
[10:39:58] <shoky> GeorgesLeYeti:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/fNgXX/
[10:40:32] <jaagr> Narhir: is the popup being showned above the #small-block-x div ?
[10:40:41] <Narhir> yes it is
[10:40:48] <Narhir> at first whe you hover over it
[10:40:53] <jaagr> Then the mouseout will trigger immidietly
[10:41:05] <Narhir> the mouse out is triggered whenever i move mouse :(
[10:41:10] <Narhir> not when I move mouse outside the box
[10:41:37] <jaagr> It is because the popup div gets focused
[10:43:03] <Narhir> so..
[10:43:07] <Narhir> what should I do to make it work ?;/
[10:43:16] <KWhat_Work> does .load() not follow redirects?
[10:43:33] <jaagr> Narhir: to explain what I mean.. move the popup div away from the #small-block div.. then you will see that the popup div will be visible until mouseout
[10:44:06] <jaagr> Narhir: Would it be possible for you to move the popup div inside the #small-block div?
[10:44:29] <shoky> KWhat_Work: it follows anything that any ajax request would follow, usually that'll include http redirects
[10:44:48] <Narhir> jaag
[10:44:49] <Narhir> yes
[10:44:58] <jaagr> Then move it inside
[10:46:14] <Narhir> jaagr wooow ;p
[10:46:16] <Narhir> so impresive ;D
[10:46:19] <Narhir> highly appriciated :D
[10:46:23] <jaagr> :)
[10:46:28] <jaagr> and by the way
[10:46:50] <jaagr> do you have alot of those bindings to get a popup showing?
[10:47:02] <Narhir> well...
[10:47:04] <Narhir> yes
[10:47:14] <jaagr> then do something like this instead... (hold on)
[10:47:15] <Narhir> basicaly unlimited amunt coz there would be "infinite scroll"
[10:50:38] <KWhat_Work> shoky: getting interesting behavior. It just returns 302 Found!
[10:51:04] <kevkell> whatup :)
[10:51:12] <kevkell> from Toronto
[10:51:30] <GeorgesLeYeti> Thank you very muck shoky
[10:52:28] <shoky> KWhat_Work: what returns 302 found?
[10:52:57] <KWhat_Work> shoky: .load() it doesnt seem to be following the second redirect.
[10:53:40] <jaagr> Narhir: http://jsfiddle.net/uQjZ4/
[10:53:47] <jaagr> Narhir: just to avoid duplicating the same stuff
[10:55:00] <KWhat_Work> shoky: so I am guess something is messed up in this "Framework".  I keep digging, thanks for the info,.
[10:55:02] <Narhir> jaagr
[10:55:08] <jaagr> http://jsfiddle.net/uQjZ4/1/ ... actually :P didn't copy all
[10:55:12] <Narhir> is it matter where in structure of this file I would plc this JS ?
[10:55:43] <shoky> KWhat_Work: does it redirect to a different origin?
[10:55:48] <jaagr> Narhir: not really... though I do recommend placing all at the end
[10:56:40] <Narhir> thank you so much jaagr :)
[10:56:45] <Narhir> cna I add you on skype or something ?:>
[10:56:54] <Narhir> jaagr++
[10:56:58] <Narhir> not sure if that works here
[10:56:58] <Narhir> heh
[10:57:32] <KWhat_Work> shoky: nope, I think I have a redirection loop ;)
[10:57:40] <shoky> derp
[10:57:45] <KWhat_Work> yup
[10:59:10] <jessie> I'm trying to use jQuery mobile, however the site I'll be using it on has jQuery and $ mapped to $K with noconflict mode enabled. Is there a way I can get jQuery mobile to work with this?
[10:59:48] <jaagr> why does it have it mapped to $K? :<
[11:00:18] <shoky> i dont really know but i highly doubt jqmobile is dependant on $
[11:00:30] <shoky> it needs jQuery most likely...
[11:01:05] <jessie> jaagr: Because we run our framework on a number of different sites that we don't own.
[11:01:22] <jessie> jaagr: Think greasemonkey, basically.
[11:01:39] <jaagr> jessie: alright
[11:02:14] <jessie> I've tried wrapping it in a closure that does (function(jQuery){...})($K) but that doesn't seem to work.
[11:03:37] <jaagr> and (function($){...})($K) ?
[11:03:52] <shoky> k i was wrong
[11:04:20] <jessie> jaagr: Yeah, and (function($, jQuery){...})($K, $K);
[11:05:02] <jaagr> and what errors are you getting?
[11:05:33] <jessie> Cannot find "mobile" on undefined" and cannot find "extend" on undefined.
[11:05:37] <jessie> Or very close unto that.
[11:06:32] <shoky> jessie: what jqmobile version are you using?
[11:07:10] <jessie> 1.3.0
[11:07:26] <shoky> yeah. it's a bug in the beta
[11:07:27] <shoky> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5448
[11:07:28] <b-ot> shoky: Issue #5448 by KennyDs (1mon 3w ago): jQuery 1.3.0 beta 1 incompatible with jQuery.noConflict()
[11:08:15] <jessie> Awesome. So use the beta, then?
[11:08:23] <shoky> no :)
[11:08:30] <shoky> the beta has the bug
[11:08:46] <shoky> wait for next release, or use 1.2.0
[11:08:59] <shoky> i think..
[11:09:07] <jessie> I guess 1.2.0 it is, then. I'll give that a shot.
[11:09:10] <jaagr> !next
[11:09:13] <jaagr> :)
[11:11:27] <shoky> jessie and if you're using jquery 1.9+  then you'll need the migrate plugin included too, before jqmobile 1.2.0
[11:12:29] <shoky> er
[11:12:59] <shoky> jessie, sorry, you said you're using 1.3.0  not the beta
[11:13:16] <shoky> jsfiddle made me think that there's only been a beta realease so far
[11:13:59] <jessie> So jQuery version 1.7 with jQuery mobile 1.3.0 official release.
[11:16:21] <shoky> well it seems to work fine.
[11:16:38] <jessie> shoky: What do you mean by that?
[11:16:54] <shoky> i mean:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/b2s5F/1/
[11:20:11] <jessie> shoky: This is more or less what I am trying to do, though: http://jsfiddle.net/b2s5F/5/
[11:21:29] <shoky> that's... not gonna work ;]
[11:21:55] <shoky> afaik
[11:22:14] <jessie> Obviously I have to change the jQuery mobile source to use $K instead of $/jQuery. I've tried that, though, and it still doesn't seem to work.
[11:22:52] <shoky> why jQuery = null  again?
[11:23:23] <jessie> To unset jQuery since we don't set jQuery. In our environment, jQuery is not defined.
[11:23:47] <shoky> it's already been set, why unset it ?
[11:24:20] <jessie> We don't unset it, we just never set it. I'm just showing you an example of more or less how it happens.
[11:24:27] <shoky> including jquery sets it
[11:24:31] <shoky> so , you've set it
[11:24:36] <jessie> We use "jQuery17002107858075760305" where the last bit changes every time.
[11:24:42] <jessie> So essentially, it's unset.
[11:25:10] <shoky> you changed the jquery source code?
[11:25:32] <Virunga> :\
[11:25:38] <Virunga> Hi!
[11:25:59] <alaing> Is it just me or should ui.newPanel.index() be a zero based index or is this a bug in jquery ui 1.10
[11:28:23] <jessie> shoky: No, we wrap it in a closure replacing jQuery with jQuery818351235 etc.
[11:29:16] <gotwig> dblosevn is not there... NOOO
[11:30:49] <FunnyLookinHat> How do you guys bind to the scroll wheel on a mouse?  I'm not seeing a good standardized event.
[11:31:54] <dcherman> jessie: why not just load jquery-mobile, THEN call noConflict(true)?
[11:33:25] <jessie> dcherman: Long story short: not feasible. Looks like I'll just have to figure out what I need to do... Thanks for the help though, guys.
[11:33:47] <kevkell> newb question
[11:33:56] <kevkell> but if there's a require.js included
[11:34:11] <kevkell> with backbone.js
[11:34:23] <kevkell> do I still need to call backbone.js?
[11:34:32] <kevkell> I'm using the backbone boilerplate
[11:34:53] <shoky> jessie: well then why not  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/b2s5F/6/
[11:35:11] <shoky> oh he/she's gone
[11:38:33] <jaagr> case closed :)
[11:38:45] <Virunga> tun tun
[11:38:46] <kevkell> ?
[11:38:48] <shoky> ^_^
[11:38:50] <kevkell> nvm
[11:39:06] <jaagr> not alot of cold talk in this chan compared to others hehe
[11:41:03] <nmeagher> quick question
[11:41:12] <nmeagher> Is it possible to change HTML when screen size == iPhone?
[11:41:34] <kevkell> ?
[11:41:57] <jaagr> to change html based on screen resolution = yes
[11:41:59] <kevkell> user agent detection, I'd say.
[11:42:18] <jaagr> you want to change specifically for iphone?
[11:42:24] <nmeagher> CSS3 media queries let you change styles based on screen size, I have a client that wants a drop down menu thats labeled Select A Location changed to Location:
[11:42:35] <nmeagher> Yes specifically for iPhone
[11:42:59] <jaagr> so "Location:" will only be changed on iphones? :o
[11:43:08] <nmeagher> Yes is that possible?
[11:43:09] <jaagr> s/changed/displayed
[11:43:37] <jaagr> as kevkell said... have a look at user agent detection
[11:43:43] <toothrot> i don't know the standard method, but using css you could have one or the other hidden
[11:43:53] <nmeagher> Hm okay, I was just wondering if the best way would be to use jQuery
[11:43:56] <shoky> i think that stuff is usually done with css media queries as well. you can change text in css
[11:44:10] <nmeagher> How can you change text in CSS?
[11:44:12] <shoky> or hide/show
[11:44:17] <jaagr> content: ''
[11:44:19] <shoky> with 'content'
[11:44:21] <nmeagher> hide/show would work but that doesn't seem logical
[11:44:40] <nmeagher> Ill take a look at content: ''
[11:44:47] <nmeagher> and also user agent detection
[11:44:49] <nmeagher> Thanks guys
[11:44:54] <toothrot> nmeagher, a: show b: hide; a:hide b: show
[11:45:04] <kevkell> nmeagher: I'd probably using viewports
[11:45:14] <toothrot> you don't change anything but styles
[11:45:20] <nmeagher> Right
[11:45:21] <toothrot> but i don't know if that's the best way to handle it
[11:45:35] <kevkell> nah
[11:45:38] <kevkell> not viewports
[11:45:40] <crankharder> how can I regulate $.resize?  It fires way too much, I really only want to trigger something when resizing starts
[11:45:42] <nmeagher> I thought it was a bit of a ridiculous request but just seeing if I was missing something
[11:45:47] <kevkell> because it can be anything from there.
[11:45:57] <jaagr> crankharder: how do you bind it?
[11:46:02] <terinjokes> anyone know if the jQuery UI tooltip is supposed to have a data attr of "ui-tooltip" like the rest of the library? for some reason it's "tooltip" here
[11:46:06] <crankharder> $(window).resize(..
[11:46:33] <kevkell> can someone answer my question now? :P
[11:46:34] <kevkell> lol
[11:46:37] <jaagr> crankharder: then handle the regulation inside the fn?
[11:46:38] <nmeagher> $(element).resize(function() {} );
[11:48:23] <jaagr> kevkell: what was ur question? too lazy to scroll up
[11:48:56] <meese> Hey - I'm trying to grab the contents of an li containing "ex1" from the URL and stick it in .test.  http://jsfiddle.net/9HUav/9/
[11:49:04] <meese> And I'm not doing it right.
[11:49:05] * jaagr is an irssi user who haven't figured out the command search yet - because of laziness.
[11:52:59] <nawi> how can I make jquery UI autocomplete work with words with spaces in them?
[11:54:44] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cork: are you still there?
[11:55:25] <NoiseEee> nawi: aren't those called sentences
[11:55:36] <NoiseEee> nawi: anyways should still work?
[11:56:04] <nawi> NoiseEee: well, I'm just autocompleting names/titles (like television show names)
[11:56:16] <nawi> NoiseEee: if I have a single entry with a space in it then I get nothing
[11:56:37] <NoiseEee> nawi: maybe pastebin and someone might help
[11:57:00] <nawi> wait a minute, it's working now :O, let me check things first
[11:57:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> When I try to parse this json code array {"1":"correct","2":"incorrect","3":"correct","4":"incorrect","5":"incorrect"} - Firebug says SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character
[11:57:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Any idea why?
[11:59:21] <jaagr> What is an unexpected characters? Serving it as json?
[11:59:30] <jaagr> s/character
[11:59:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> i do json_encode in php
[12:00:29] <jaagr> could you pastebin the snippets of ur code?
[12:00:31] <GeorgesLeYeti> Hi again
[12:00:33] <GeorgesLeYeti> :D
[12:00:35] <GeorgesLeYeti> http://jsfiddle.net/fNgXX/3/
[12:00:54] <kojul> if the call is JSON.parse({"1":"correct","2":"incorrect","3":"correct","4":"incorrect","5":"incorrect"}) well then of course it's going to error, JSON.parse takes a stringâ¦ it needs to be JSON.parse('{"1":"correct","2":"incorrect","3":"correct","4":"incorrect","5":"incorrect"}'). that's the only thing I can think of.
[12:01:03] <GeorgesLeYeti> Do you know any function to reset the contextMenu ?
[12:01:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> in Jquery? JSON.parse?
[12:02:35] <GeorgesLeYeti> Jquery
[12:02:42] <GeorgesLeYeti> oh
[12:02:44] <GeorgesLeYeti> sry
[12:05:23] <gotwig> Hey, dudes.. I need some help.
[12:05:31] <gotwig> so, my code is here http://pastebin.com/wAwGwkzt
[12:06:37] <gotwig> I have duplicated for gridster, I redefine it all the time... can you tell me how to make it global for the whole file? So I dont have to do all the time var gridster=code, but just one time gridster = code ... and than access it across the document via gridster.methods...
[12:08:49] <gotwig> come on folks :O
[12:09:47] <meese> Hey - I'm trying to grab the contents of an li containing "ex1" from the external document and stick it in .test. http://jsfiddle.net/9HUav/21/
[12:09:54] <meese> But failing
[12:09:56] <meese> and ideas?
[12:10:17] <meese> oops, 1 sec
[12:10:37] <gotwig> my current code is something like $(function(){ //DOM Ready
[12:10:38] <meese> updated jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/9HUav/22/
[12:10:39] <gotwig>     
[12:10:39] <jaagr> meese "from the external document"?
[12:10:41] <gotwig>        $(".gridster ul").gridster({
[12:10:43] <gotwig> 			ready: function() {$('#spinner') ... }
[12:10:46] <meese> jaagr: the URL
[12:11:02] <jaagr> meese: ah, filtered that out :P I'll have a look
[12:11:05] <gotwig> If I want gridster global across the whole document, so I can access it from other javascript functions, what do I have to do?
[12:11:15] <Soltis> What's the general way to retrieve an existing handler for an event?
[12:11:22] <gotwig> for now I use     var gridster = $(".gridster ul").gridster().data('gridster');
[12:12:04] <jaagr> meese: uh...
[12:12:10] <gotwig> oh dudes.. its so easy
[12:12:16] <Soltis> In other words, like var h = el.onclick, only for arbitrary events.
[12:12:16] <gotwig> are you pros or what
[12:12:23] <meese> note: I'm probably using these functions incorrectly....
[12:12:29] <ericelliott> Soltis: capture it when you create the event handler and hold on to it.
[12:12:40] <Soltis> ericelliott: That's capturing, not retrieving.
[12:12:59] <nawi> something weird is going on, autocomplete only works if I reload jquery twice
[12:12:59] <Soltis> ericelliott: Don't tell me this isn't something jQuery can do. That would be . . . depressing.
[12:13:04] <meese> jaagr: what?
[12:13:23] <ericelliott> Soltis: there is no documented interface for retrieving.
[12:13:28] <NoiseEee> Soltis: $.cache afaik
[12:13:51] <gotwig> when I use the jQuery time statement
[12:13:54] <gotwig> or method
[12:14:04] <gotwig> how does it work, does it really wait the time?
[12:14:08] <gotwig> like, in real life?
[12:14:35] <Soltis> Ugh. That's just . . . bad. Of course, every JS library I've seen is full of weird exceptions, inconsistencies, and caveats -- so this hardly surprises me.
[12:15:16] <GeorgesLeYeti> Why is producing such a bug (http://jsfiddle.net/fNgXX/4/ ) 1st on all when you double click the context menu appear (why not) but i would like to simple click (and i don't want trigger: 'left' because what i really want is a double click but when i put word.dblclick i have to click 4time to show the conext menu)
[12:15:17] <ericelliott> Soltis: why do you want it?
[12:15:31] <gotwig> Soltis: "even"? Javascript is a specification, no implementation
[12:15:41] <ericelliott> Soltis: there may be another way to do what you're trying to do -- there may even be a BETTER way.
[12:15:41] <GeorgesLeYeti> and 2nd bug is more problematics the context menu don't reset
[12:16:12] <ericelliott> gotwig: jQuery is a library, not a specification -- although there are other libraries which try to be API compatible with jQuery.
[12:16:23] <gotwig> ericelliott: he said JS library
[12:16:23] <GeorgesLeYeti> every time you click you will get the same context menu while i want it to change depending on which word you are clicking on
[12:16:25] <Soltis> ericelliott: I have to deal with someone else's code; several someone else's. So for various events they may have done something hair brained I have to trap before I can do what actually needs to be done.
[12:16:59] <gotwig> ericelliott: I can't read... its ok xD
[12:17:07] <ericelliott> Soltis: I believe Chrome dev tools can give you insight into current event listeners.
[12:17:13] <NoiseEee> Soltis: can't you just profile?  do a task and see what was called?
[12:17:30] <gotwig> Soltis: yeah, you can use the inspector tools from chrome
[12:17:41] <Soltis> NoiseEee: Sure, if I want to do that for every single use path in every single page in an ENORMOUS HUGE HUGE web app.
[12:17:56] <ericelliott> Soltis: figuring out what's actually going on and making it work the way it needs to is much better than monkeypatching over things that you don't fully understand.
[12:17:59] <NoiseEee> Soltis: why not fix whats brokened first :)
[12:18:09] <Soltis> NoiseEee: I can't make other people do their work better.
[12:18:17] <Soltis> NoiseEee: And I also can't do their jobs for them.
[12:18:30] <NoiseEee> Soltis: anyways no there's no quick way nor quick answer.  the closest thing you can do afaik is to look at elements and see what handlers are on them, and even that is chrome only
[12:18:44] <NoiseEee> Soltis: afaik jquery can't tell or list handlers attached via non-jquery methods, for example
[12:19:16] <Soltis> NoiseEee: For, say, onclick it's easy -- el.onclick will give you whatever was set, however it was set.
[12:20:04] <jaagr> meese: cross domain
[12:20:31] <dcherman> Soltis: jquery doesnt use those interfaces for events.  you can use the ****UNDOCUMENTED**** $._data( elem, "events" ) api if you just want to debug stuff.  i would not add that into your production code, you'd probably regret it at some point in the future.
[12:20:48] <Soltis> dcherman: Yeah, that's hardly a good idea.
[12:20:56] <Soltis> dcherman: I don't want to make the mess *worse*.
[12:21:43] <meese> jaagr: elaboration?
[12:22:27] <jaagr> meese: XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://mbyt.me/dcm/clients/tiraspol/AutoCheck.html. Origin http://fiddle.jshell.net is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[12:22:38] <meese> oh...
[12:23:01] <jaagr> meese: a hint for the future...
[12:23:03] <NoiseEee> Soltis: "el.onclick will give you whatever was set, however it was set."  ?  really
[12:23:06] <meese> jaagr: wait
[12:23:09] <meese> that's the wrong doc
[12:23:11] <meese> :|
[12:23:13] <meese> anyway
[12:23:17] * meese is dumb.
[12:23:36] <jaagr> try shouting it out in the console... http://jsfiddle.net/9HUav/25/
[12:23:51] <jaagr> then you'll notice those minor errors on ur own
[12:24:15] <NoiseEee> Soltis: how would i get one or all in http://jsfiddle.net/GE6Ba/ ?
[12:27:25] <jaagr> meese: just out of curiousity... what are you trying to accomplish?
[12:27:38] <jaagr> other than extracting data of that site that is -.-
[12:28:22] <Soltis> NoiseEee: If I understood what I was told elsewhere, .onclick returns a synthetic function which comprises whatever happens when the click event is fired off; of course, that may not be accurate.
[12:29:04] <meese> jaagr: mbyt.me is my domain. I'm trying to get content of <li>'s by searching for keywords and sticking that into a new HTML doc.
[12:29:16] <meese> into certain divs
[12:29:26] <NoiseEee> Soltis: looking at my example, i can't see how one would retrieve the guts of either 3 listeners i've attached.  so that was news to me and i'm not sure if i believe what you've been told elsewhere :)
[12:29:48] <NoiseEee> Soltis: afaik a solution to that just doesn't exist yet, maybe someone can correct me.
[12:30:14] <bluesm> Is ".data" would work with older browsers ?
[12:30:15] <sky> I want to use each() and then check for if a sibling is within a selected optgroup
[12:30:21] <jaagr> meese: then change ur params to allow that origin
[12:30:43] <wroos> Hi. How hard would it be to change the background color for a li in this http://jsfiddle.net/fRxVs/55/ ? And how should I do it?
[12:30:47] <meese> jaagr: Not sure. What you mean. How would I do that?
[12:31:09] <meese> Not sure what you mean.*
[12:31:34] <jaagr> what server are you running?
[12:32:25] <meese> jaagr: it's linux, but I don't know what the OS of the eventual server that will host it will be.
[12:32:35] <meese> let me see if I can find out.
[12:35:13] <meese> jaagr do you understand what I'm trying to do?
[12:36:27] <jaagr> yes
[12:36:32] <jaagr> but ur browser is blocking it
[12:37:03] <meese> jaagr: I'm now working locally.
[12:37:21] <meese> jaagr: Am I even on the right track with my code?
[12:39:21] <jaagr> meese: I'd recommend using a proxy script
[12:39:59] <jaagr> that would make the actual cross-origin requests to happen on the server-side
[12:40:29] <meese> jaagr: btw, I'm only reading from the URL
[12:40:36] <jaagr> huh?
[12:41:12] <jaagr> what back end language are you using?
[12:41:13] <jaagr> php?
[12:41:44] <meese> jaagr: this is only a script
[12:42:20] <jaagr> which is?
[12:44:00] <meese> I'm trying to write a script which jcopies <li> contents FROM the URL and place them within certain divs within the document which contains the jquery (or it could be some other document, it doesn't matter). Also, the file I'm reading from will be a local file
[12:44:06] <jaagr> You won't be able to make a cross-domain request unless you've got the possibility to use jsonp or a proxy script (that will occur on the server side)
[12:44:17] <meese> jaagr: it's not cross domain
[12:44:38] <meese> I was using a URL in jsfiddle, but the files will all be on the same server
[12:45:01] <jaagr> Will the file you're requesting be on the same domain?
[12:45:15] <meese> yes. All of the files will be.
[12:45:21] <meese> every file in question.
[12:45:22] <jaagr> Well, then I don't see the problem
[12:45:37] <meese> jaagr: do, my script should work?
[12:45:39] <meese> so*
[12:45:59] <jaagr> Easiest way to see is to try it?
[12:46:03] <meese> I have been
[12:46:11] <meese> I haven't gotten it to work.
[12:46:20] <meese> that's why I posted it in here ;)
[12:46:27] <jaagr> Are you getting any errors?
[12:47:13] <jaagr> It's impossible to use jsfiddle against the uri you're requesting, so kinda hard to test for others.
[12:47:27] <jaagr> just output the data you recieve to the console
[12:49:19] <meese> jaagr: best way to test for errors in this particular case? I usually use jsfiddle for stuff like this
[12:49:29] <meese> but I guess in this case I can't
[12:49:35] <philosophically> trying to make drop downs, but they aren't positioning underneath their respective links, if anyone could take a look i'd greatly appreciate :D 184.154.212.220
[12:50:37] <jaagr> philosophically: place the dropdown <ul>'s inside the <li> that it belongs to
[12:50:54] <jaagr> meese: well it's easy for urself to test it...
[12:51:00] <philosophically> jaagr: i believe they are...
[12:51:03] <jaagr> meese: just dump out the data you get from the request to the log
[12:51:18] <jaagr> philosophically: i believe they are not
[12:52:53] <philosophically> jaagr: lol, umm this is what my html looks like http://pastebin.com/xUWTERKN
[12:52:56] <jaagr> meese: add "console.log(data);" to your callback func
[12:53:12] <philosophically> jaagr: ahh, nm
[12:53:23] <jaagr> philosophically: exactly :)
[12:53:34] <jaagr> you're closing the <li> before the sub <ul>
[12:54:09] <philosophically> jaagr: thank you, always nice to have another set of eyes :)
[12:54:54] <jaagr> philosophically: hehe yeah.. by the way.. you can do all that using css :) just a tip
[12:55:12] <philosophically> jaagr: awesome, i will look into it

[13:19:04] <Guest68615> but someone found a way to upload shit onto www.google.com
[13:19:07] <veQue> what's the worse that can happen?
[13:19:16] <Guest68615> And execute other script
[13:19:19] <Guest68615> Worst?
[13:19:30] <Guest68615> Someone could fake another gmail page on google's own servers
[13:19:38] <veQue> hmm
[13:19:47] <Guest68615> Fake google wallet on their own servers
[13:19:49] <Guest68615> Kinda serious
[13:19:50] <veQue> link me to the article
[13:19:55] <Guest68615> No article
[13:20:04] <veQue> how do you know?
[13:20:04] <Guest68615> Just example shown via twitter
[13:20:22] <veQue> link me to something
[13:20:29] <Guest68615> ....
[13:20:38] <fission6> is there  a convenient way to make a js object from a table
[13:21:02] <Stephen> Sorry guest nick
[13:21:09] <Stephen> Anyway, google exploit
[13:21:09] <veQue> http://thedroidguy.com/2013/03/yahoo-mail-users-still-getting-hacked-despite-vulnerability-fixes/
[13:21:27] <Stephen> The only example I have is the actual exploit, and I'm not too comfortable pblishing it public...
[13:21:38] <Stephen> veQue, can I msg?
[13:22:10] <Stephen> In an old style hack
[13:22:27] <Stephen> Upload page which publishes to web-viewable directory
[13:22:30] <veQue> sure
[13:24:37] <Stephen> Anyway, I don't show anything has been exploited yet, but someone published the problem on Twitter
[13:24:51] <Stephen> So either Google will fix it fast, or someone will push an upload quick
[13:30:07] <philosophically> jaagr: hey there, i'm still having the same issue of submenus not loading under the menu tag.. if you have a moment could you take a look? thanks! http://184.154.212.220/
[13:30:24] <veQue> maybe i can set a flag when the + button is pressed
[13:34:23] <philosophically> so i'm having a problem where all my drop downs show up in the same place not under their appropriate links.. appreciate anyone to take a looksie http://184.154.212.220/
[13:36:45] <bluesm> $('.tour').on('click', "button" ,function(){} )    VS  $('.tour button').on('click' ,function(){})  VS $('.tour').find("button").on('click' ,function(){})
[13:36:52] <jaagr> philosophically: I'll have a look
[13:37:02] <bluesm> Could you point out the difference ?
[13:37:57] <jaagr> philosophically: add "position: relative;" to the <li> and it will work
[13:37:59] <philosophically> jaagr++
[13:38:11] <philosophically> jaagr: you da man!!
[13:38:15] <jaagr> :)
[13:40:08] <relipse>  how to use $.validator.addMethod with 3rd parameter "param" ?
[13:41:26] <philosophically> jaagr: i'm slow today. my apologies, can't get it to work. set #menu li to position relative, tried #menu a to relative, having a hell of a time :P
[13:42:49] <jaagr> philosophically: what exactly doesn't work? it's worked fine for me when I added position: relative to the <li>
[13:43:20] <jaagr> did you add "position: relative;" to ".navigation li"?
[13:43:53] <amh345> are there any methods available in jquery to detect/monitor when a div element has changed?
[13:44:42] <jaagr> philosophically: in my web inspector, when I add "position: relative" to #menu li... it looks fine
[13:44:54] <jaagr> use the inspector to see if it's really there
[13:44:56] <philosophically> jaagr: ok cool, i will play around with it
[13:45:08] <ThoMe> hiho.
[13:45:12] <philosophically> jaagr: thanks again! if it works for you i will make it work
[13:45:19] <ThoMe> hello, I would like checked all checkbox with class XYZ
[13:45:20] <ThoMe> $('.queueIDS input[type="checkbox"]').prop('checked', true);
[13:45:21] <ThoMe> is it wrong?
[13:45:26] <jaagr> philosophically: also check if it's getting overwritten along the way
[13:45:29] <ThoMe> example class "queueIDS" ?
[13:45:52] <jaagr> ThoMe: no it's not wrong
[13:46:03] <ThoMe> jaagr: jo.
[13:46:07] <ThoMe> hm. i test. thx
[13:46:41] <wesbos> anyone on windows? can you see this character:  Ë
[13:46:47] <jaagr> also.. why not test before asking? :)
[13:46:56] <ThoMe> jaagr: sorry.
[13:47:03] <ThoMe> jaagr: hm. no error. but doesnt works
[13:47:09] <ThoMe> jaagr: what is wrong?
[13:47:23] <jaagr> ThoMe: Maybe ur script doesn't get triggered?
[13:47:24] <shoky> ThoMe: $('input[type=checkbox].queueIDS').prop('checked', true);
[13:47:27] <philosophically> jaagr: you know whats weird, firefox isn't working but safari isâ¦ odd
[13:47:46] <jaagr> shoky: that implied that the input has a class of .queueIDS
[13:47:49] <ThoMe> shoky: oh. hm. easy :-)
[13:47:51] <shoky> ThoMe:  or $('.queueIDS:checkbox')
[13:48:00] <shoky> jaagr: that's what he asked for
[13:48:01] <jaagr> s/implied/implies
[13:48:32] <jaagr> well, I didn't understand the question that way
[13:48:36] <ThoMe> shoky / jaagr thank you! :-)
[13:48:56] <jaagr> philosophically: I'm using chrome... I'll check firefox
[13:49:04] <Stephen> Oh, geez
[13:49:14] <Stephen> Now I understand what's going on
[13:49:29] <relipse> how can I ajax upload with progress bar and drop target like gmail and stuff?
[13:49:31] <shoky> wesbos: yah
[13:49:41] <wesbos> shoky thanks
[13:50:35] <Stephen> var your = $("#game").remove();
[13:50:42] <jaagr> relipse: do it yourself or look up https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[13:50:50] <Stephen> There should probably be a "delete your;" in there somewhere
[13:51:04] <Stephen> Else the problem is just going to present itself again
[13:52:05] <NoiseEee> relipse: http://webstandardssherpa.com/reviews/dissecting-gmails-email-attachments/
[13:52:16] <jaagr> philosophically: just have to build firefox... :>
[13:52:56] <ThoMe> recommends a an easy lightbox?
[13:53:43] <philosophically> jaagr:  lol, build?
[13:54:07] <jaagr> philosophically: i'm on linux.. but i'm done... so I'ma check
[13:54:15] <Stephen> I'm supposing I could use .detach() instead
[13:54:18] <philosophically> jaagr:  ahhh gotcha
[13:54:20] <Stephen> What do you think?
[13:54:38] <Stephen> var the= $("$game").detach(); delete the;
[13:55:42] <jaagr> philosophically: add "left: 0;" to ul.submenu
[13:56:17] <philosophically> jaagr: PRESTO! you are awesome, allow me to buy you a beer
[13:56:24] <gf3> MAKE IT SO
[13:56:31] <jaagr> philosophically: please do! ;)
[13:57:25] <Stephen> I'm afraid the human mind has a "new" in it's garbage collection function.
[13:57:49] <jaagr> philosophically: I'd also recommend adding a top: (whatever) to the ul.submenuy
[13:58:44] <philosophically> you're a wizard jaagr
[13:59:04] <philosophically> your owl is coming..
[13:59:34] <jaagr> I'm a wizard that hates firefox' inspector big time.
[13:59:51] <Stephen> firebug++
[14:00:12] <philosophically> jaagr:  yea, I'm a big fan of firebugâ¦ hmmm
[14:00:31] <jaagr> yep
[14:00:47] <jaagr> I just built it so didn't install firebug... but the built-in inspector sucks
[14:00:56] <philosophically> jaagr:  ahhh gotcha
[14:01:13] <jaagr> google should have more lectures for the other browser-building-companies!
[14:01:27] <Stephen> Ever since seeing the 3D Dom inspector, I've been itching to build a game that turns the DOM into a platformer
[14:01:39] <jaagr> Stephen: would be cool :)
[14:02:59] <aep> 3d dom just makes me feel bad about the tons of wrapper divs :/
[14:03:08] <Stephen> lol
[14:03:11] <Stephen> word
[14:03:36] <Stephen> But see, if you had the game, then you could feel secure in knowing that there has to be steps to get up there somehow.....
[14:03:47] <jaagr> aep: then it's time to reduce them?
[14:04:10] <Stephen> You could always tell them their properties are whack
[14:04:19] <Stephen> Maybe they'll just give up on their own
[14:04:32] <jaagr> Stephen: that made me think about a cool idea about a html learning game
[14:04:57] <Stephen> Now that I have your attention
[14:05:13] <Stephen> var the = $("#game").detach(); delete the;
[14:05:21] <Stephen> Churn over it a second
[14:05:32] <jaagr> The faster they get to the top - the higher the score will be... to avoid unnecessary (?) divs
[14:06:01] <jaagr> s/divs/nesting
[14:06:14] <Stephen> jaagr: That would be nice, the problem is that usually extra divs are there to handle things like position property changes
[14:06:19] <jaagr> Stephen: uhm... what are you trying to achieve?
[14:06:38] <Stephen> jaagr: Isn't it obvious?
[14:06:46] <Stephen> jaagr: The point is to lose the game.
[14:06:53] <jaagr> Stephen: well I wish that was the case. But looking at the majority of sites - I don't find that to be the case
[14:07:25] <jaagr> Stephen: then just: gameOver(); ?
[14:07:29] <aep> Stephen: someone stole your idea http://www.epiphanysearch.co.uk/blog/the-firefox-3d-dom-inspector/
[14:07:43] <Stephen> So upset I had to explain that
[14:08:44] <Stephen> aep: Not so much. He's intending on building DOM's specifically for the game there
[14:09:03] <Stephen> I'm almost certain one would have to add some fudging in certain cases
[14:09:07] <Stephen> But yeah
[14:09:18] <Stephen> Seeing the DOM in 3D is going to spark that with some folks
[14:09:30] <jaagr> Stephen: lame.
[14:09:33] <wachpwnski> If you are generating things from an ajax request, and you get a dom that you then want to style with jquery ui, how to you insure that accordion is called after the ajax requests?
[14:09:33] <Stephen> Question is: Does he have an established game to add the feature to like I do?
[14:09:46] <Antonis> Hello I am displaying a div when I click on #foo but I also want to hide it when I click anywhere on the page so I use body. the problem is that when I click on #foo the div appears and disappears quickly how should I solve this?
[14:09:56] <jonez> I'm using $.post(), configured to expect a result in json. the backend sends back a json_encoded() array with one key called 'score'. my question is if I need to call $.parseJSON in this case. the data I get back says "array"
[14:10:42] <Stephen> wachpwnski: Put the accordian call in the success callback
[14:11:07] <jaagr> jonez: if you get back "array" as data it means that the php output was "array"... I take for granted that you're using php, in this case.
[14:11:18] <wachpwnski> Stephen: like the finally/always?
[14:11:21] <jonez> jaagr, I am using php on the backend, yes
[14:11:25] <poisonarms> If I did something like, var list = $('.some_class'); and there are multiple elements with some_class, does jQuery return an array?
[14:11:27] <Stephen> Antonis: Look into stopPropagation()... you need to stop the event from bubbling
[14:11:44] <jonez> jaagr, the php script does a "print json_encode($foo)", which should be ok.
[14:11:53] <jonez> $foo in this case is an array
[14:11:57] <Stephen> poisonarms: Yes
[14:12:07] <poisonarms> Stephen, thank you.
[14:12:21] <Antonis> Stephen, I am doing that but it still hides itself
[14:12:34] <jaagr> jonez: did you try to dump out the raw value of the json_encode ?
[14:12:41] <jonez> yes.
[14:12:52] <jaagr> and yes, you will need to use $.parseJSON
[14:12:54] <jonez> {"score":-51}
[14:12:57] <jonez> which looks right
[14:14:13] <Stephen> wachpwnski: look up jquery's $.ajax
[14:14:27] <jaagr> jonez: in JS: tried to dump the raw data in the callback?
[14:14:50] <Stephen> wachpwnski: It is a callback that is run when the ajax call has data successfully returned
[14:14:52] <jaagr> just find it weird that it says "array"
[14:15:19] <wachpwnski> Stephen: I am modifying the dom based on the ajax.
[14:15:38] <NoiseEee> if you get something back that says "array" then the php side is not doing what you planned on it doing.
[14:15:59] <wachpwnski> I see what you are saying though, because it will be blocking within the done.
[14:20:42] <jaagr> ncmpcpp ~/.mpdconf
[14:20:54] <jaagr> wrong chan...
[14:22:58] <Stephen> wachpwnski: Done and Success are basically the same thing. Are you wanting to be sure the object exists in the dom before calling accordion?
[14:23:34] <terinjokes> anyone know of the differences in widget creation between UI 1.8 and UI 1.9?
[14:23:57] <Stephen> wachpwnski: Because another way of handling that is to add a script element to the end of your new DOM with the correct accordion call in it. It's a bit hacky, but it will work.
[14:25:18] <Joel> http://pastebin.com/guz5UU8N - an alert in the js below the formatter gets triggered, but when I hit submit the validator isn't triggered, thoughts?
[14:25:20] <Joel> I do see the following in the console: $.validator {settings: Object, currentForm: form#locations_validate.new_location, labelContainer: v.fn.v.init[0], errorContext: v.fn.v.init[1], containers: v.fn.v.init[0]â¦}
[14:25:20] <Joel> so I know there is a validator, I'm just not sure why it isn't being called?
[14:26:02] <jaagr> Stephen: same thing? nah.
[14:26:15] <Stephen> joel: shouldn't it be "location[name]"?
[14:26:32] <Stephen> joel: not "locations[name]"
[14:26:59] <Stephen> er, the other way
[14:27:02] <Joel> Stephen the name on the html input? It shouldn't matter, it should be using the id.
[14:27:10] <Stephen> You've got a mismatch
[14:27:31] <Joel> Stephen where?
[14:27:32] <Stephen> oic
[14:28:02] <Stephen> nm, you are night
[14:28:04] <Stephen> right
[14:28:53] <Stephen> jaagr: I know, I know, but the whole blocking thing is incorrect.
[14:29:11] <jonez> jaagr, I found part of my problem-- I did not set up the div correctly.
[14:29:18] <Stephen> jaagr: wachpwnski seems to be dealing with a race condition.
[14:29:18] <jonez> jaagr, now it looks like the js isn't running at all.
[14:30:19] <jaagr> jonez: paste me the new code plx
[14:30:28] <jonez> k
[14:30:33] <Stephen> terinjokes: UI 1.9 depends on a different version
[14:30:53] <jonez> pastebin or /query ?
[14:31:00] <terinjokes> rightâ¦ we're on 1.9.1 of jQuery in both cases
[14:31:23] <Stephen> I'm just fucking with you. No one responded so my inner troll came out
[14:31:23] <jaagr> jonez: pastebin
[14:31:34] <jonez> k
[14:32:03] <terinjokes> (actually, that's not true, but seems unrelated)
[14:32:23] <jaagr> Stephen: full time troll?
[14:32:28] <jonez> jaagr, http://pastebin.com/sYXig9uA
[14:33:46] <Joel> Stephen gah, dumb ass validator, it is using the name for some god awful reason.
[14:33:57] <GastonM> hi all
[14:34:03] <GastonM> need help guys
[14:34:06] <Stephen> Joel: I win
[14:34:14] <Stephen> http://pastebin.com/RRdEihEv
[14:34:17] <GastonM> my first time at irc
[14:34:49] <Stephen> Welcome GastonM. Prepare to get helped by the best crew of trolls in the business
[14:34:58] <GastonM> after my migration to 1.9.1
[14:34:59] <GastonM>   $("#btnApply").click(function () {             $("#recognitionForm").submit();         });          $("#recognitionForm").validate({             submitHandler: function (form) {                 variablesViewModel.applyrecognition(currentNodeId, $("#checkValue").is(":checked"), $("#txtComment").val());                 alert('Recognition has been changed.');             }         });
[14:35:09] <GastonM> this code does not run anymore
[14:35:50] <GastonM> hi
[14:35:54] <GastonM> anyone
[14:35:55] <jaagr> jonez: div.form :) funny
[14:35:58] <Stephen> GastonM: please use Pastebin
[14:36:08] <jonez> jaagr, ;)
[14:36:16] <GastonM> how?
[14:36:17] <Stephen> However, reading
[14:36:25] <Stephen> http://www.pastebin.com
[14:36:27] <jonez> I had to wrap the form in a div so I can have an ajax-based submit mode
[14:36:32] <Stephen> Make a new paste, share the link
[14:36:44] <Stephen> Code in the channel is generally discouraged
[14:37:25] <Stephen> GastonM: Perhaps better would be http://jsfiddle.net/
[14:37:43] <Stephen> GastonM: You can include DOM elements and such on that site
[14:37:44] <jaagr> jonez: why not access the form directly?
[14:37:52] <jaagr> jonez: well, back to your problem.. :P
[14:38:26] <jonez> because I sometimes have more than one form on the page
[14:38:35] <Stephen> GastonM: I already see your problem. It's is(":checked") I'm betting
[14:39:00] <Stephen> GastonM: Are you familiar with the whole attr() / prop() situation in jQuery?
[14:39:07] <jaagr> jonez: then add an #id or .class to the form
[14:39:17] <jonez> good point :)
[14:39:35] <GastonM> stephen
[14:39:37] <GastonM> nop
[14:40:20] <GastonM> how can I fix it?
[14:40:35] <jaagr> jonez: http://jsfiddle.net/uqjXW/ so when you run this you don't get any data in your console.log?
[14:40:38] <Stephen> GastonM: Basically, replace .is(":checked") with .prop("checked")
[14:41:06] <jaagr> jonez: and btw... instead of innerHTML = ''... you could just use jQuery's own .html('')
[14:41:22] <Stephen> GastonM: The long explaination is that what you are looking at is the DOM attribute "checked" there, which only takes the value of what is initially in the DOM
[14:41:33] <GastonM> thanks a lot :D,
[14:41:36] <jonez> jaagr, correct
[14:41:39] <GastonM> sorry my english
[14:41:39] <Stephen> Not a problem
[14:41:43] <GastonM> i'm from argentina
[14:41:44] <Stephen> You've done fine
[14:41:50] <Stephen> I couldn't even tell
[14:41:53] <jonez> jaagr, and when I try alert(data) all I get is "Object"
[14:42:04] <jaagr> jonez: well, console.log(data);
[14:42:08] <garciawebdev> hola cheeeee
[14:42:13] <jaagr> jonez: doesn't show anything?
[14:42:15] <Stephen> Pero, que necessita habla espanol, comprendo un pequito
[14:42:23] <jonez> jaagr, I'll double check hold on
[14:42:42] <jaagr> jonez: yeah, cause it sounds weird that it would alert Object and not output anything when logging it to the console
[14:42:44] <Stephen> console.log() FTW
[14:42:46] <Stephen> SO much better
[14:42:56] <Stephen> If you must alert:
[14:43:09] <Stephen> alert(JSON.stringify(data));
[14:43:28] <Stephen> beware self-referencing objects though
[14:43:42] <jaagr> right now I can't think of any case where an alert would be needed... so console.log()-it!
[14:43:50] <Stephen> Yup
[14:44:12] <Stephen> Or, if you want to be fancy, use one of the many other console methods offered
[14:44:26] <jaagr> also... concatenate the parameters to console.log(); no need to repeat it
[14:44:27] <Stephen> I've yet to see someone actually use console.warn()
[14:44:55] <Stephen> Firebug son, quit making excuses
[14:44:57] <jaagr> we actually use console.warn / console.info() / console.log() where I work
[14:45:00] <taz> Hi , i am using jquery ui 1.9.2>>> the spinner is not working in chrome
[14:45:01] <Stephen> Install it, then do what jaagr said
[14:45:20] <Stephen> jaagr: Nice
[14:45:30] <taz> can anyone help
[14:45:35] <Stephen> jaagr: What case do you use info for?\
[14:45:38] <jaagr> but then again all console.~() are ommited upon buikld
[14:45:49] <jaagr> s/buikld/build
[14:46:11] <Stephen> jaagr: Node.js?
[14:46:17] <Stephen> Why are you building?
[14:46:50] <jaagr> we use alot of node.js yes.. but we got environmental tags ommitting code when we deploy
[14:47:10] <Stephen> Heh
[14:47:17] <jonez> jaagr, the return value from $.parseJSON(data) is null
[14:47:19] <Stephen> Dealt with that on Friday
[14:47:27] <GastonM> not run
[14:47:29] <GastonM> :(

[14:47:48] <Stephen> Boss had hidden away code in some ENV code in VS2010
[14:47:48] <jaagr> Stephen: our staging environment will take care of that
[14:47:54] <Stephen> Debugger didn't even find it
[14:48:06] <jaagr> then reroll that debugger!!!1 :)
[14:48:17] <Stephen> Drove us nuts while trying to convert to 64bit environments
[14:48:18] <jonez> jaagr, fixed it. turns out I do not need to use .parsejson() at all
[14:48:23] <Stephen> He found and fixed it.
[14:48:30] <jaagr> jonez: just output the data to the log and check what it says
[14:48:37] <jaagr> jonez: ok cool
[14:48:56] <jonez> jaagr, ty for your help
[14:49:11] <jaagr> Stephen: We're a bit strict so we always have a running staging environment before deploying.
[14:49:15] <poisonarms> Can anyone explain why I'm getting this error? http://pastie.org/6455230 -- Each item in the array should be a jQuery object right? Wouldn't it have the .hasClass() method?
[14:49:28] <Stephen> GastonM: Could you supply more of the code, use http://jsfiddler.net to give us more details
[14:49:33] <sheilablackrose> hi guys how can i get a dd/mm/yyyy format from this? var renewalDate = new Date($('input[name="RenewalDate"]').val());
[14:49:58] <GastonM> ok
[14:49:59] <anew> will jquery hold negative ints or do you need to do something special ?
[14:50:00] <Stephen> jaagr: Same here, we had QA people barking about missing features, and it took days to hunt down
[14:50:01] <jaagr> jonez: cool thing you got it working :)
[14:50:08] <anew> i have a value="-1"
[14:50:14] <anew> but it always gets saved into db as '1'
[14:50:15] <Stephen> anew: It will handle them fine
[14:50:20] <anew> weird
[14:50:30] <anew> i'm reading the value field as -1 but the ajax saves it as 1
[14:50:32] <jaagr> Stephen: Hehe yeah, been there
[14:50:32] <GastonM> before 1.9.1 was running ok, if this informotion helps
[14:50:37] <jonez> jaagr, ya :) it's a password strength checker that I rewrote in php and made a front-end using jquery
[14:50:45] <Stephen> anew: Use parseInt(value)
[14:51:08] <anew> stephen where do i put that ?
[14:51:08] <anew> phone = $("#phone").val();
[14:51:11] <jaagr> jonez: I'd recommend adding some restriction to the polling tho
[14:51:15] <Stephen> GastonM: It does help, but we need more.
[14:51:24] <jaagr> jonez: or limitations actually...
[14:51:30] <Stephen> anew: Wherever you are converting that string of "-1" into an integer
[14:51:35] <jonez> jaagr, like what? :)
[14:51:45] <jaagr> jonez: or moderation... lol - I'm swedish, don't blame me
[14:51:47] <anew> i dont understand ...
[14:51:51] <anew> where does that happen ?
[14:51:53] <anew> when i grab the value ?
[14:51:59] <Stephen> anew: Otherwise, set it this way: value=-1
[14:52:16] <jaagr> jonez: to limit the amount of polling to the server
[14:52:18] <clockman> integerval = parseInt($("#id").val());
[14:52:24] <Stephen> anew: If you are grabbing it from an input, yes,
[14:52:27] <anew> phone = parseInt($("#phone").val());
[14:52:29] <anew> like shit ?
[14:52:31] <anew> *this
[14:52:35] <Stephen> lol
[14:52:37] <Stephen> Yup
[14:52:39] <anew> lol
[14:52:44] <anew> let me try
[14:53:05] <Stephen> Hah, storing phone numbers as negative to retain the dashes
[14:53:11] <jonez> jaagr, oh.. like set a timer on the keyup event that polls the server after a delay?
[14:53:11] <Stephen> That's kinda clever actually
[14:53:17] <anew> no didnt work stephen
[14:53:34] <anew> still saved in db as positive
[14:53:36] <Stephen> anew: jsfiddler.net please, give some context
[14:53:40] <GastonM> http://jsfiddle.net/4p6u8/
[14:53:57] <taz> hi , why is my number spinner not working in chrome
[14:54:04] <jaagr> jonez: yeah, well to not allow polling on every keyUp.. imagine if 10.000 people would poll at the same time... your server would probably crash and burn
[14:54:14] <anew> k give me a sec
[14:54:28] <Stephen> anew: If you are comparing by looking in your database, make sure the column is storing Signed Integers, not Unsigned.
[14:54:57] <Stephen> K folks, love helping, but I have 5 minutes until the wife picks me up
[14:55:03] <jonez> jaagr, I could make a counter that increments and when it gets to 4-5 *then* do a poll
[14:55:04] <jaagr> jonez: Where I work we have millions of users every day, so we gotta think about those things... a bit damaged by that maybe hehe :)
[14:55:15] <anew> ok
[14:55:17] <Stephen> I hope my help here has been useful
[14:55:18] <anew> let me checkthat first
[14:55:23] <jonez> jaagr, you bring up a good point actually. I appreciate the insite
[14:55:28] <Stephen> One of you will create a web service which really buys me beer
[14:55:31] <anew> stephen can you tell your wife to come in 30 minutes ?
[14:55:38] <Stephen> lmfao
[14:55:40] <Stephen> Hell no
[14:55:42] <anew> rofl
[14:55:44] <Stephen> There is scotch at the house
[14:55:46] <jaagr> jonez: I recommend setting a timer on the actual polling
[14:55:49] <anew> :D
[14:56:22] <Joel> where's the api for the formhelper submit call?
[14:56:26] <jonez> jaagr, k
[14:56:32] <GastonM> http://jsfiddle.net/4p6u8/
[14:56:34] <Joel> I can find submit_tag, but not submit
[14:56:35] <jaagr> jonez: for example: I type a password, it takes 1.5s and then it polls... if I make any change before that 1.5s it resets from 0 and starts timing again
[14:56:55] <jaagr> jonez: well, you get the idea...
[14:56:56] <sheilablackrose> hi guys please help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/p8HYj/
[14:57:00] <motka> is there any artificial intelligence jquery plugin?
[14:57:07] <motka> like: $.('#div').ai(); ?
[14:57:35] <jaagr> sheilablackrose: ?
[14:57:36] <jonez> jaagr, ya
[14:57:43] <jaagr> sheilablackrose: what's ur prob?
[14:58:02] <sheilablackrose> the date format
[14:58:10] <sheilablackrose> im getting renewal date as mm/dd/yyyy
[14:58:16] <sheilablackrose> i need it to be dd/mm/yyyy
[14:58:48] <Stephen> GastonM: Ok, this is deeper than the code you have here, but it's my guess that "applyrecognition" is looking for "checked" as a string instead of a bool
[14:59:03] <Stephen> GastonM: $("#checkValue").prop("checked") is going to return a bool
[14:59:06] <motka> is there any artificial intelligence jquery plugin?
[14:59:08] <motka> like: $.('#div').ai(); ?
[14:59:11] <Stephen> Which is the  right way
[14:59:50] <Stephen> motka: Not that I know of, but you might research a guy named suttree (Duncan Gough) he's done a lot of work there
[14:59:52] <jaagr> sheilablackrose: could you give us the input[name="RenewalDate"] ?
[14:59:58] <anew> ok yeah when i console.log($("#phone").val());
[15:00:00] <anew> i get 2
[15:00:00] <GastonM> ok, will check that
[15:00:15] <anew> when i view page source i see <input type="hidden" value="-2" name="phone" id="phone" safafasf/>
[15:00:24] <anew> but when i inspect element i see <input type="hidden" value="2" name="phone" id="phone" safafasf/>
[15:00:26] <motka> Stephen: what it does then?
[15:00:28] <jaagr> .ai() ? lol yeah that would be nice... would make me unemployed :(
[15:00:37] <Stephen> anew: Try  console.log($("#phone").text())
[15:00:48] <motka> why not?
[15:00:52] <anew> i bet that's it
[15:00:53] <motka> here in bosnia workers have no rights
[15:00:54] <anew> one second
[15:00:59] <motka> so why not leave robots working
[15:01:08] <jaagr> well I don't live in bosnia
[15:01:10] <Stephen> motka = troll
[15:01:20] <sheilablackrose> the value from that input[name="RenewalDate"] field is 7/03/2013
[15:01:26] <Stephen> :-)
[15:01:49] <kojul> anew: sounds like there is some javascript setting the value in between page load and when you try to get the value in the console.
[15:02:05] <GastonM> http://jsfiddle.net/4p6u8/1/
[15:02:07] <Stephen> anew: You might even try $("#phone").prop("value") and see how that works out for you
[15:02:20] <Stephen> kojul: Good point
[15:02:22] <motka> screw you stephne
[15:02:25] <motka> stephen*
[15:02:30] <GastonM> I added applyrecognition to Fiddle
[15:02:30] <motka> if I were a troll
[15:02:38] <Stephen> motka: Forgive me, not trying to piss you off
[15:02:39] <motka> I wouldn't knew anything about javascript & jquery
[15:03:06] <Stephen> motka: AI is fairly complicated, encompassing everything it can do is a bit out of scope generally for jQuery
[15:03:15] <tw2113> can't we all just get along?
[15:03:19] <Stephen> I was trying to be funny
[15:03:22] <motka> there are about 1000 people in this chatroom
[15:03:23] <tw2113> *sheds tear*
[15:03:24] <anew> console.log($("#phone").text()); gives nothing, let me try .prop
[15:03:31] <Stephen> heh
[15:03:38] <motka> 1000 people CAN create an AI jquery plugin
[15:03:44] <motka> and I can be thy leader
[15:03:51] <motka> like stallin, tito, .. the rest
[15:03:53] <sheilablackrose> jaagr - the value from that input[name="RenewalDate"] field is 7/03/2013
[15:03:55] <Stephen> anew: I suggest working with kojul when I leave, he may be on to something
[15:03:56] <jaagr> I see him trollin'.... I'm hatin'...
[15:04:08] <anew> ok kojul
[15:04:11] <anew> thanks
[15:04:15] <jaagr> sheilablackrose: well then you're recieving it in the right format
[15:04:31] <motka> I was, in my last sentance
[15:04:35] <motka> sorry about it
[15:04:36] <motka> but why not
[15:04:46] <motka> create a UserListener event
[15:04:54] <jaagr> #ai
[15:04:59] <motka> which listens all the future events which might be conducted by the end-user
[15:04:59] <motka> ?
[15:05:12] <sheilablackrose> but when i do new Date($('input[name="RenewalDate"]').val());  the format i get is month first
[15:05:41] <Stephen> adios from Texas bitches
[15:05:45] <Stephen> Have a good night
[15:05:45] <jaagr> sheilablackrose: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_obj_date.asp
[15:05:52] <GastonM> stephen
[15:05:59] <anew> prop gives blank value also
[15:06:31] <sheilablackrose> thanks
[15:06:44] <illmat> do you guys still care about IE 7 or 8?
[15:07:34] <tw2113> IE8 yes, IE7 only when someone notices something broken
[15:07:35] <jaagr> 8 yeah
[15:07:46] <tw2113> IE6 HAHAHAA
[15:07:47] <GastonM> who can help me guys?
[15:08:00] <GastonM> i'm going crazy :D
[15:08:19] <GastonM> http://jsfiddle.net/4p6u8/1/
[15:08:20] <tw2113> that's no good
[15:08:21] <tw2113> that's my job
[15:08:38] <illmat> hehe ok, my site works up to 95% on IE8, i guess that's ok ;)
[15:08:46] <GastonM> after 1.9.1 migration code don't run anymore
[15:09:17] <illmat> just some minor graphic bugs
[15:09:26] <jaagr> illmat:
[15:09:40] <jaagr> http://dowebsitesneedtolookexactlythesameineverybrowser.com/
[15:09:42] <test22222222> hi
[15:09:54] <test22222222> <li class="tab" title="#nirc">#nirc</li>
[15:10:00] <test22222222> how to check if that exists inside a ul
[15:10:07] <illmat> jaagr: haha
[15:10:11] <illmat> great site
[15:10:16] <jaagr> hehe yeah
[15:12:00] <jaagr> test22222222: console.log($('ul').find('#id').length);
[15:12:23] <jaagr> or .children() if it's a direct child
[15:12:24] <illmat> would be even more funny if to would look different on every browser
[15:12:30] <illmat> *it
[15:12:35] <jaagr> illmat: hehe haven't checked... maybe it does
[15:12:58] <jaagr> pretty sure it does using <IE7
[15:13:04] <jaagr> <=IE7
[15:13:13] <sheilablackrose> jaagr it doesnt show how to change the format.
[15:14:22] <jaagr> sheilablackrose: ok like you more already since you at least have a look :)
[15:14:22] <motka> why don't we make jQuery serveside?
[15:14:25] <motka> server-side?
[15:14:32] <sheilablackrose> hahaha
[15:14:42] <jaagr> motka the troll? l2nodejs
[15:14:46] <sheilablackrose> im passing a string but i dont know how to manipulate the format
[15:15:00] <motka> node.js supports jquery?
[15:15:17] <motka> meaning: not in the quotes while expressing/outputing a string ?
[15:16:38] <jaagr> motka: javascript being a horrible "language" I doubt that anyone would ever put it on their todo-server-side-language-list
[15:17:02] <jrajav> motka: jQuery is a DOM abstraction library. It doesn't make sense in the context of Node.js
[15:17:02] <jaagr> sheilablackrose: could you paste me ur code again pls?
[15:17:53] <motka> jaagr.. for me it's the best language out there
[15:18:02] <sheilablackrose> sure
[15:18:02] <motka> I don't knowk why you're here at jQuery
[15:18:03] <jaagr> motka: good for you :)
[15:18:09] <tw2113> you love the javascripts?
[15:18:16] <motka> sure
[15:18:19] <motka> why not?
[15:18:24] <sheilablackrose> http://jsfiddle.net/p8HYj/
[15:18:26] <tw2113> because that's what jQuery is
[15:18:26] <motka> 3 reasons please!
[15:18:37] <sheilablackrose> where the value pass is this 7/03/2013
[15:18:51] <test22222222> d
[15:19:12] <jaagr> motka: you want reasons why? :)
[15:19:27] <terinjokes> jquery ui shared options across multiple instances?
[15:19:51] <jaagr> if you really think it's "the best language out there", you really should know why
[15:20:10] <danheberden> there's a #javascript channel where you can bash the language, if you're so inclined
[15:20:27] <motka> JAVASCRIPT IS THE BEST
[15:20:28] <danheberden> terinjokes: make an object, use that object across multiple instances
[15:20:35] <jaagr> motka: "ok"
[15:20:46] <djshotglass> how would i fire off the enter button keypress on an input
[15:21:22] <danheberden> djshotglass: trigger with the correct charCode/which code
[15:21:28] <jaagr> sheilablackrose: I'll post you an update
[15:21:44] <sheilablackrose> tq
[15:21:55] <djshotglass> better yet how do i look at what evens are bound to an element
[15:21:58] <djshotglass> events*
[15:22:29] <terinjokes> danheberden: seems like yes, since options is in the prototype. this seems to have been incorrectly implemented in a previous version of jquery ui
[15:22:48] <danheberden> terinjokes: i don't think i understand what you mean
[15:23:04] <danheberden> djshotglass: for debugging, dev tools lets you see
[15:23:08] <jonez> is the first param to setTimeout() supposed to be a string?
[15:23:22] <jonez> I'm getting a "useless timeout" error in the js console
[15:23:23] <danheberden> jonez: it can be, but that evals it - use an anonymous function instead
[15:23:37] <jonez> k ty
[15:23:37] <danheberden> setTimeout(function(){ /* do shit */ },9001);
[15:23:40] <GastonM> sad, I can't help
[15:23:55] <terinjokes> danheberden: i have a number of custom widgets written during the 1.8.x era of UI. Seems then different instances of widgets had different prototype chains, and thus if you changed something on the prototype it didn't change in other instances.
[15:24:26] <danheberden> terinjokes: in ui 1.8 the prototype was (and still is, iirc) $.ui
[15:24:28] <terinjokes> this has been corrected, it seems, and now all instances of my custom widgets share stateâ¦ I'm confirming that's the correct diagnosis.
[15:24:31] <danheberden> like - that's where they are
[15:24:51] <terinjokes> danheberden: i don't think you understand, that's not what I'm saying
[15:24:56] <danheberden> terinjokes: i must not be
[15:27:58] <motka> imal srba ovdje?
[15:30:45] <terinjokes> danheberden: in other words, I'm not expecting this.options to equal $.ui.foo.prototype.options
[15:31:18] <StephenS> motka, ima
[15:31:26] <danheberden> terinjokes: i could be wrong, but isn't there .options and .originalOptions ?
[15:31:35] <danheberden> maybe i'm thinking of the wrong thing
[15:32:09] <motka> pa djesi srbine, puska te ranila
[15:32:17] <StephenS> ?

[16:28:10] <coldhead> sheilablackrose: i hate Date() and find it almost impossible to use. you should try moment.js which makes dates nicer

[16:33:55] <Andres__> i need to add rows with text fields dinamically.. it is not correct to use id selectors for this?
[16:34:50] <systemfault> id sucks :P Forget about them
[16:35:12] <Andres__> css selectors instead?
[16:35:36] <guruJust1n> How do you pass a variable, that declares a number, for height in this function -> .css('height', variable);??
[16:35:40] <systemfault> Depends on the caseâ¦ classes + custom attributes could be a good combination for your specific issue
[16:36:05] <anew> my page is split up into left div and center div, but i'd like to load the center div before the first div when user first enters the page.  how can i do this with jq ?

[16:40:23] <bzitzow> Jquery UI Accordion. I've styled a custom header for each item in the accordion. It has an image that when clicked is revealing a hidden menu.

[16:42:56] <say2joe> actually, might need to swap order of the end() and delay() methods.
[16:44:45] <anew> sweet thanks a lot, will test that out now

[18:26:02] <SCIF> It's do nothing :( But if i change id of element to "test" â everything works fine.
[18:26:24] <SCIF> Is there any issues jquery handling square brackets?
[18:26:26] <shoky> SCIF:  that finds an element with id="form_question"  that has an "email" attribute
[18:26:27] <tw2113> not sure that's a valid ID selector
[18:26:44] <SCIF> I escaped [ ] with \
[18:26:48] <SCIF> Same :(
[18:26:53] <tw2113> shoky can correct me if he needs to
[18:27:09] <shoky> SCIF: the id is 'form_question[email]' ?
[18:27:30] <shoky> and if so, what kind of element is it?
[18:27:34] <SCIF> Yeah :(
[18:27:39] <SCIF> Input
[18:27:45] <SCIF> Text input

[18:29:18] <SCIF> I am idiot :(

[18:37:34] <rainabba> I'm suddenly getting an error that seems to be coming from jQuery but Google isn't providing any insight. "Sizzle.Error = function ( msg ) { throw new Error( "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: " + msg ); } and msg="#mst_MainContent_mst_MainContent_qes^131241519Panel"  Any ideas what's going on? I don't see any reason for a syntax error.
[18:38:07] <gf3> rainabba: Perhaps an invalid ID?
[18:38:14] <rainabba> Hmm.
[18:38:35] <rainabba> No kidding
[18:39:34] <rainabba> The element exists in the DOM inspector. Something invalid about that ID itself?
[18:39:51] <gf3> I don't know, just a guess
[18:40:42] <rainabba> No, you hit the nail. $('#mst_MainContent_mst_MainContent_qes^131241519Panel') returns: Error: Syntax error, unrecognized expression: #mst_MainContent_mst_MainContent_qes^131241519Panel

[18:42:50] <coldhead> i was programmed to feel that way
[18:43:02] <rainabba> But do you know why?
[18:43:17] <coldhead> i'm not programmed to find out
[18:43:28] <systemfault> coldhead is a state-of-the-art IRC bot written in brainfuck.

[18:43:41] <coldhead> i can be pretty fucking funny
[18:43:52] <coldhead> is that superior enough?
[18:44:27] <rainabba> systemfault: The thing that always messes with me is when I can't tell if it's really a programmed reply or of someone is prompting/coding on the fly.

[18:50:51] <calosa> hi guys I'm wondering if there's anyway to declare a variable with jquery with the name of an element...ie I have a div name example, can I make a var named example (that is obviously dynamic and I don't know beforehand that it willb e named example) thanks for letting me know!
[18:52:10] <djQuery> calosa, hmmmm?    var somestring = 'whatever'; var $elm = $('#' + somestring);
[18:52:49] <calosa> thanks! exactlyl what I wanted  I'm a little rusty with jQuery, haven't used it in a while
[18:54:46] <coldhead> way to comprehend, djQuery
[18:54:52] <coldhead> i tip my hat
[18:56:42] <calosa> english isn't my main language sorry
[18:56:55] <coldhead> it's okay, it all worked out great!
[18:56:58] <calosa> ^^

[19:25:53] <omani_> I wanna make a html form and based on the answer of a user, I want to move several css boxes around the website (horizontally)
[19:25:59] <omani_> is there any function for this?
[19:26:35] <omani_> so it should be dynamically. I can use ajax for information transport
[19:26:50] <omani_> but without loading the entire website, I want to move around divs.
[19:26:54] <LocalPCGuy> ?fiddle @ amani_
[19:26:56] <bot-t> amani_, #12735 (SlideToggle causes text to shrink after it is closed/opened ... - Opened 2 days ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/12735
[19:27:00] <LocalPCGuy> oops...
[19:29:11] <omani_> LocalPCGuy: this is slidetoggle
[19:29:12] <LocalPCGuy> omani_ you seem to be asking a few different questions.  Moving HTML boxes around the page - .animate() maybe?
[19:29:23] <omani_> animate?
[19:29:27] <omani_> hmm let me have a look
[19:29:39] <LocalPCGuy> omani_ yah, ignore the bit about slidetoggle
[19:37:50] <omani_> ok
[19:38:10] <omani_> I mean
[19:38:19] <omani_> do you know website where you can see tags
[19:38:23] <omani_> most popular tags etc.
[19:38:29] <omani_> and you can move these tags around
[19:38:45] <omani_> and they move around like a globus
[19:38:57] <omani_> ?
[19:39:34] <tw2113> tag cloud
[19:40:40] <omani_> yes
[19:40:42] <omani_> a tag cloud
[19:40:44] <omani_> thanks
[19:41:10] <omani_> this is what I want, except. that the tags are moving whenever somebody hits a radio box in my html form
[19:41:17] <omani_> I would response with an ajax handler
[19:41:21] <omani_> in json format or whatever
[19:41:30] <omani_> and jquery shall automatically move these tags around
[19:41:52] <omani_> if it gets the information that a tag named "foo" should be placed first/top/above/bottom etc.
[19:42:29] <omani_> is this possible with animate?
[19:43:31] <LocalPCGuy> omani_ you could use CSS transitions, position the tags absolutely, and then just adjust the top/left position.  The CSS3 transition will automatically animate the element to the new position
[19:43:48] <LocalPCGuy> and /join #css to get info on HOW to do that
[19:44:20] <LocalPCGuy> omani_ CSS3 transitions won't work in old IEs though

[20:01:29] <omani_> tw2113: why? :)
[20:01:50] <omani_> I think IE is old technology
[20:02:11] <tw2113> i was agreeing with you
[20:02:12] <omani_> focus on the new generations. chrome, firefox, etc.
[20:02:17] <omani_> cool ;)
[20:02:22] <tw2113> fuck IE in general
[20:02:26] <omani_> yeah man

[20:48:14] <tw2113> that's a pretty taxing selector
[20:48:30] <beshoo> i want to sort all HTML tags
[20:48:38] <tw2113> if the government collected that amount of tax, we'd be in surplus for once

[20:48:52] <beshoo> lol
[20:48:56] <tw2113> $('*')
[20:49:55] <tw2113> that amount of tax would pay the national debt and still have surplus

[20:53:29] <casalo> here's the script http://pastie.org/private/vubvt7xukmkg8bbcu3rh8a
[20:53:52] <casalo> I'm not doing anything other than displaying the value of that variable in my php script so I don't think it's that altering it
[20:54:05] <danheberden> casalo: google "json_parse"
[20:54:07] <danheberden> for php
[20:54:17] <danheberden> also, stripslashes
[20:54:24] <danheberden> also, stop using php - it's icky
[20:54:29] <danheberden> also, i need more bourbon
[20:54:32] <casalo> but wouldn't just displaying the value as is not alter the result?
[20:55:50] <casalo> I guess I could use stripslashes though (was aware of that and json_decode/json_parse) I was just wondering why I was receiiving something different
[20:57:07] <tw2113> i heard danheberden only hates php when drinking

[21:08:14] <unstable> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[21:08:21] <unstable> Why is there no http:? What is //?
[21:08:29] <danheberden> it's magic, is what it is
[21:08:31] <coldhead> that lets the browser use https or http
[21:08:39] <coldhead> without having to switch from one to the other
[21:08:46] <coldhead> it just uses the protcol the html is using
[21:08:52] <unstable> coldhead: So each browser can have it's own preference/setting?
[21:08:56] <coldhead> no
[21:09:05] <coldhead> so IE doesn't say OMG UNSECURED CONTENT
[21:09:10] <unstable> I see, so whatever the html was transferred as, it will be transferred as?
[21:09:14] <coldhead> if you load a http scrip tfrom an https page
[21:09:18] <coldhead> yes
[21:09:24] <unstable> ok, that's clear.
[21:09:29] <unstable> Thanks for the information and help, I appreciate it.
[21:09:33] <coldhead> damn straight! enjoy!
[21:09:38] <danheberden> haha, how did someone come to the correct conclusion by coldhead saying "no, so IE doesn't say OMG UNSECURED CONTENT"
[21:09:43] <danheberden> now THATS magic
[21:09:59] <coldhead> i have a certain charm, danheberden
[21:10:16] <danheberden> coldhead:  is it the one of the two hearts connected together?
[21:10:25] <danheberden> coldhead: do you have one of those charm bracelets?
[21:10:40] <tw2113> danheberden, clearly coldhead used the lazy eye
[21:10:42] <coldhead> i have one that says FA CU
[21:10:49] <coldhead> and my friend has one that says TTY NT
[21:10:59] <danheberden> hhahahaha
[21:11:04] <coldhead> it's very meaningful to us personally
[21:11:40] <danheberden> coldhead: i share charms with my mom, too

[21:52:01] <coldhead> i'm having a 0 productivity day, tw2113. i'd watch anything at this point, from anyone, for any reason
[21:52:14] <coldhead> why YES i would like to know more about live organ harvesting in china!

[21:54:28] <tw2113> danheberden, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7akjeomUck
[21:54:37] <coldhead> nice try, dan, but mobile boyfriend is too precious to waste on office hours
[21:55:29] <coldhead> wow youtube sure has a lot of crud
[21:56:28] <danheberden> coldhead: executive koala?
[21:56:29] <tw2113> both a perk and a downfall of user contribution
[21:56:34] <danheberden> tw2113: another gem of amazingness

[22:04:30] <coldhead> creeping
[22:15:30] <solarflares> so
[22:15:53] <solarflares> north korea recently made a threat to wipe out a small south korean island
[22:16:04] <solarflares> in the last couple hours it seems
[22:16:29] <coldhead> cool, it's like cuba part 2
[22:17:30] <solarflares> maybe kim jong un thinks he is playing risk
[22:22:06] <unstable> https://github.com/JohnTheodore/faceplace/blob/master/js/script.js ... I am trying to hide this submit button, until the form is valid. If I just do $("#registration").validate(); that works by itself. It requires dob and email, from my em tags in the html: https://github.com/JohnTheodore/faceplace/blob/master/register.php
[22:24:21] <unstable> I did the codecademy stuff, though I still don't understand a few things. Why are there parameters inside function sometimes, but not other times.
[22:24:53] <solarflares> because sometimes the function needs the parameters and other times it doesnt
[22:25:28] <coldhead> it's kind of like a woman's love
[22:25:43] <unstable> Why does it just say 'function'. I am creating a function.. but it has no name?
[22:25:54] <unstable> Like you love a function that has no name?
[22:25:58] <chovy> solarflares: what else is new. they threated to nuke the US this past weekend.
[22:27:31] <coldhead> unstable: functions are just a kind of data type so you can pass them around, assign them to vars, whatever
[22:27:46] <coldhead> var aids = function () { alert('aids aids aids'); }; aids();
[22:28:59] <unstable> What is this submithandler doing in the validation plugin?
[22:32:37] <B|aster> hey I have a $('select').change(function() { .... });  but it doesnt fire when I use the up and down arrows on my keyboards to change between options.  How could I make it fire when I do that?
[22:32:50] <B|aster> s/keyboards/keyboard
[22:32:58] <shweta> in the .js of the calander which i use
[22:33:15] <shweta> the date is selected when we double click on a particular date
[22:33:24] <shweta> how to achieve this with a single click
[22:34:22] <shweta> anyone plz let me know
[22:34:46] <coldhead> what if you click it once and have a friend make the other click? that's only a single click each
[22:35:05] <coldhead> closed: resolved
[22:35:22] <shweta> <coldhead> :) thats not the way it is required...
[22:35:42] <coldhead> damn
[22:35:48] <shweta> yes
[22:36:12] <shweta> the .js file is as follows
[22:36:45] <shweta> eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,d){e=function(c){return(c<a?'':e(parseInt(c/a)))+((c=c%a)>35?String.fromCharCode(c+29):c.toString(36))};
[22:37:02] <shweta> if(!''.replace(/^/,String)){while(c--){d[e(c)]=k[c]||e(c)}k=[function(e){return d[e]}];e=function(){return'\\w+'};c=1};while(c--){if(k[c]){p=p.replace(new RegExp('\\b'+e(c)+'\\b','g'),k[c])}}return p}('g={};g.B=a(Y,1m,1k){3.Y=Y;3.1m=1m;3.1k=1k;3.3x()};g.B.l.4C=a(){3.3t();b(c.3i){c.3i=3;3.2n();w}3.3g();3.2n();3.2Q();3.1P();c.3i=3};g.B.l.3x=a(){3.f=3.Y?3.Y+"-3D":"4J-1b-3D";3.E=4K;3.U=1Y[(3.E.3M||(1F.3B?1F.3B:1F.3M)).2s()]||1Y["3Q"];3.
[22:39:18] <vladikoff> just call =Y;3.1m=1m;3.1k=1k;3.3x()} and then (1F.3B?1F.3B:1F.
[22:47:57] <coldhead> vladikoff: <3
[22:51:04] <unstable> sweet, it works
[22:53:12] <shweta> is it possible to select date with single click in calandar
[22:54:23] <ryanneufeld> shweta: yes
[22:54:28] <ryanneufeld> but not with the one you're using
[22:55:02] <shweta> ryanneufeld>plz suggest a juery calandar
[22:55:14] <ryanneufeld> shweta: jquery ui
[22:55:37] <shweta> my requirement is that we can choose from months and years
[22:56:04] <shweta> with jquery ui its different
[22:56:27] <ryanneufeld> shweta: I'm sorry, I have no other suggestions for you
[22:56:37] <ryanneufeld> have you tried google?
[22:56:46] <shweta> yes
[22:56:56] <coldhead> yeah i've used google too
[22:56:58] <coldhead> good service
[22:57:27] <coldhead> apparently they do youthtube, too
[22:57:49] <shweta> i checked a number of calanders
[22:58:16] <shweta> but i need one like the one in compute taskbar
[22:58:47] <tdignan> shweta: try one of my favorite techniques, tell the client: "There are no calendars that do this already. I'm going to have to charge an extra $xxxx for custom calendar development.... Or, we can just use jQuery UI."
[22:58:47] <shweta> no need to navigate back multiple times
[22:59:05] <shweta> <tdignan>no dear
[22:59:08] <shweta> :)
[22:59:15] <ryanneufeld> shweta: what is a compute taskbar?
[22:59:38] <shweta> ryanneufeld> calendar gadget
[23:00:18] <ryanneufeld> shweta: if you can't find one, then you have to make it
[23:00:25] <ryanneufeld> good luck
[23:01:22] <ryanneufeld> we'll miss you shweta
[23:01:57] <coldhead> forever and ever

[23:03:41] <unstable> How can I get the error to fadeIn ?
[23:04:50] <tdignan> unstable: did you add the 'text-error' class to the appropriate dom element? or is that supposed to be done for you already
[23:05:00] <dsevigny> http://jsfiddle.net/49FdM/ <- Two things, this setup works on a site that I'm working on but not JSFiddle. Second of all is harder to explain.
[23:05:49] <grafi> woah...
[23:06:33] <dsevigny> grafi: ?
[23:06:48] <unstable> tdignan: The text-error works, it is red the way I want it.
[23:06:55] <unstable> tdignan: The thing that isn't working, is fading in.
[23:07:14] <tdignan> unstable: maybe start the state of that element at display:none
[23:07:19] <tdignan> then fading in will be possible.
[23:07:37] <tdignan> just a guess.
[23:09:03] <unstable> $(errorClass).hide(); $(errorClass).fadeIn(2000);
[23:09:13] <unstable> I tried this, that still doesn't work.
[23:09:44] <grafi> dsevigny: well first of all, id's are called id's for a reason... they are unique on the site ... therefor you should use class for your html...
[23:11:02] <tdignan> unstable: does the highlight callback ever fire?
[23:11:06] <grafi> dsevigny: further more your both click handlers are exactly the same as far as I can see?
[23:11:49] <grafi> dsevigny: im guessing you wanted it to be left and left2? which you could write as $('.left, .left2').click() and drop the second block of repeated code
[23:12:30] <dsevigny> I didn't know about the ability to perform on multiple selectors. That will help
[23:12:31] <unstable> tdignan: alert('hi'); works if I put it inside the highlight callback.
[23:13:55] <dsevigny> Now to the second part, but it's more a css issue that I'm hoping JQ can override.
[23:15:43] <tdignan> unstable: when you call your selector -- do this: var elem = $(my_selector) ; console.log(elem)
[23:16:00] <tdignan> look in firebug/web inspector console and see if what is printing is what you were actually looking for.
[23:16:54] <dsevigny> I'm trying to set a background colour so that it's a little easier to see this part.
[23:17:58] <prilax> hello
[23:17:59] <grafi> probably best to avoid white then :P
[23:18:41] <tdignan> unstable: might as well print the 'errorClass' being passed in, too, and make sure it actually contains 'text-error'
[23:19:47] <prilax__>  bac+
[23:20:28] <unstable> tdignan: yes, it contains text-error
[23:22:49] <dsevigny> http://jsfiddle.net/49FdM/8/ <- when you click on the top center (grey) it will extend down, pushing the next row aside. the next left2 ends up at the lower right. I want it in the blank spot on the lower left.
[23:23:18] <dsevigny> the following .left should be on the lower right.
[23:24:17] <tdignan> unstable: i'm out of questions. If you make a jsfiddle I can further assist
[23:26:19] <dsevigny> grafi is that clear as mud?
[23:27:29] <grafi> i see your problem but i dont really know how to fix that :P
[23:28:42] <dsevigny> See why I was having trouble explaining it?
[23:29:17] <dsevigny> It's one of those bloody corner cases, that you should never have to deal with, except when the designer is being silly.
[23:29:38] <unstable> tdignan: http://jsfiddle.net/SENYC/1/
[23:31:07] <unstable> I've never used jsfiddle before, holy crap that is awesome.
[23:31:29] <dsevigny> There we go? I can explain it now! lmao? http://jsfiddle.net/49FdM/9/ <- I numbered the cells and it makes sense to explain. Click 2, put 4 back where it started, moving 5 and after instead.
[23:31:47] <bluesm> $('.tour').on('click', "button" ,function(){} )    VS  $('.tour button').on('click' ,function(){})  VS $('.tour').find("button").on('click' ,function(){})
[23:31:51] <bluesm>  Could you point out the difference ?
[23:34:37] <grafi> dsevigny: http://jsfiddle.net/49FdM/10/ much more fun to look at :P
[23:35:05] <dsevigny> lol
[23:35:34] <dsevigny> little beyond my jq xp though
[23:36:00] <grafi> not that complicated really, still doenst solve the problem though :P
[23:36:20] <dsevigny> lol?. I don't know that it can be, based on the specs for CSS and HTML.
[23:36:45] <dsevigny> because technically, 4 would have to come BEFORE 2 if it was going to be on the other side.
[23:37:11] <dsevigny> a float can only affect the elements coming after it
[23:38:47] <dsevigny> I believe this is one of those unsolveables, unless?. wait? what if we set the margin on 4 to -widthOf2?
[23:40:38] <dsevigny> but how could I dynamically select cell 4? it would be the next .left2
[23:44:23] <dsevigny> never mind. That doesn't work either. 4 eats 3
[23:45:39] <grafi> dsevigny: maybe try something like this http://masonry.desandro.com/ the demo seems like it could be a solution for your troubles
[23:47:00] <dsevigny> grafi that is a fantastic find
[23:47:06] <dsevigny> that's what I'm looking for alright
[23:47:21] <grafi> ;)
[23:47:27] <grafi> and it was in my head all along ^^
[23:55:47] <unstable> tdignan: What if I do .siblings some how?
[23:56:20] <tdignan> sure, why not? but what you're doing with the basic class selector should work fine.
[23:56:26] <tdignan> try running your code in the console?
[23:56:30] <tdignan> the javascript one
[23:57:22] <tds5016> hey. I'm having a hard time getting appendTo to work on a sortable....
[23:57:39] <tds5016> appendTo: document.body,
[23:57:44] <unstable> tdignan: http://jsfiddle.net/SENYC/2/ .. this sort of does what I want.
[23:57:44] <unstable> heh
[23:57:54] <tds5016> it appears to not actually add it to the body....
