[01:16:33] <uptilldawn> anyone here on #php?
[02:24:46] <anli> Is it possible to split a html attribute on multiple lines?
[02:26:39] <slax0r> sure https://jsfiddle.net/z5r0xgtv/
[02:27:06] <slax0r> sometimes its good if you actually try trivial stuff before asking...
[02:45:01] <Duikb00t> o
[04:13:04] <lilalinux> Since live() and delegate() are deprecated, what can I use to dynamically handle events for future items?
[04:28:45] <Cork> lilalinux: delegate isn't really depricated
[04:28:51] <Cork> it is superseeded (not the same thing)
[04:29:05] <Cork> lilalinux: .on does all the things of .bind and .delegate
[04:29:19] <Cork> and .delegate is just a translator for .on now days
[04:29:30] <Cork> (moves the argument order a bit)
[04:29:53] <Cork> lilalinux: http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=1.11.2&fn=jQuery.fn.delegate
[04:30:29] <lilalinux> Cork: I thought live and delegate also handle events for elements that don't exist yet
[04:30:52] <lilalinux> does on() really does the same
[04:30:52] <lilalinux> ?
[04:31:39] <Cork> lilalinux: on is a combination function
[04:31:47] <Cork> it does different things based on what arguments you give it
[04:31:55] <Cork> in one case it does the same thing as .bind
[04:32:05] <Cork> and with other arguments it does the same thing as .delegate
[04:32:28] <Cork> so the answer isn't a "yes/no" it is "some times"
[04:32:30] <lilalinux> so if I want all future LI of an UL to handle a click, how would I do that?
[04:32:47] <lilalinux> all LI A that is
[04:32:51] <Cork> lilalinux: http://api.jquery.com/on/
[04:33:07] <Cork> check the "selector" argument
[04:33:44] <lilalinux> ah, now I see
[04:33:52] <lilalinux> thank you
[04:34:18] <Cork> ah... sorry i just noticed the old translation functions has been deprecated in 3.0
[04:34:39] <Cork> so ya, .bind and .delegate is deprecated now dasy
[04:34:43] <Cork> *days
[04:35:14] <lilalinux> do I bind the on() to the ul and use selector "li a"?
[04:35:27] <Cork> lilalinux: it works EXACTLY the same as bind
[04:35:43] <Cork> only difference is you do (event, selector) instead of (selector, event)
[04:35:51] <Cork> uh...
[04:36:02] <Cork> FAIL i meant it works exactly like .delegate
[04:36:09] <lilalinux> :-)
[04:38:20] <lilalinux> gr8
[04:43:17] <zalun> how to check if an element is the first one?
[04:43:27] <Cork> first what?
[04:43:35] <Cork> first child? first in selector result?
[04:43:36] <Cork> what?
[04:43:37] <zalun> first child
[04:43:52] <Cork> either add :first-child in the selector
[04:43:59] <zalun> I tried el.first() == somElement
[04:44:01] <Cork> use use .is(':first-child')
[04:44:11] <zalun> the second - cool
[05:20:49] <chipyy__> hey
[05:20:56] <chipyy__> could somebody invite me to php?
[05:21:28] <chipyy__> or mybe helped me here, i want to modify google maps ..
[05:21:44] <chipyy__> and its combination php,ajax,xml,sql
[05:40:03] <Cork> chipyy__: you need a registered nick
[05:40:08] <Cork> also it is ##php
[05:40:17] <chipyy__> ok i will try
[05:40:30] <Cork> /ns help register
[05:40:42] <chipyy__> i have function on load which connect to php file and etc.
[05:41:05] <chipyy__> is possible that i on click change this function or somehow remove it?
[05:41:37] <Cork> not sure what you're asking, but you can't have js modify php code
[05:41:43] <chipyy__> if is there possibility i would need to change only PHP file inside this function
[05:42:01] <chipyy__> i know that, i want to call other php file
[05:42:23] <Cork> you don't have php files in a function...
[05:43:31] <Cork> you can make an ajax call from the browser and have the server send scripts or data back
[05:43:37] <Cork> that is about all js can do
[05:43:41] <chipyy__> http://pastebin.com/xXJBRdLN
[05:43:57] <itsmemario> hi
[05:44:03] <chipyy__> this function loads onload :)
[05:44:19] <chipyy__> this is like my default map when u come to my site
[05:44:22] <Cork> chipyy__: you mean it is called on load?
[05:44:30] <chipyy__> yes
[05:44:45] <chipyy__> obviously i didnt explained good :)
[05:44:45] <Cork> ok, so you want to change what latlng is used?
[05:44:52] <Cork> or what?
[05:44:56] <chipyy__> no, i will explain
[05:44:58] <morlenxus> In jqueryui i can show a red colored icon with <span class='ui-state-error'><span class=ui-icon ui-icon-image'></span></span> now, is there a way to show the red icon without the outer span? I don't want the border around the icon.
[05:45:18] <chipyy__> this is my default map, which shows last 100 markers on map.
[05:45:24] * Cork afk
[05:46:18] <chipyy__> but i have also search function on my site, with this search function u can search by markers and i need to change xml.php because there is a sql query which sets which markers will show
[06:10:16] <chipyy__> i am using counter, i set var counter right under document ready function
[06:10:51] <chipyy__> and counter ++ i have in ajax succes, and its always on 1
[06:26:13] <mike_papa> I insert some html into div using .load(), and after that, I'm not able to find any element in new html. Firefox shows that DOM structure in Inspector, but it's greyed out. How do I correctly insert new code, so I can find it's elements for further use?
[06:34:24] <chipyy__> is anybody using boostrap datitimepicker or used it? i have some problems with setting minDate option
[06:54:19] <Cork> mike_papa: grayed out normally means the element isn't connected to an element that is connected in the dom

[11:14:16] <masuberu> hi
[11:14:29] <bomb> Hi
[11:14:55] <masuberu> $.ajax(type: 'POST', ...) is adding my the parameters to the URL, why is that?
[11:15:07] <taplar> that's invalid
[11:15:22] <taplar> $.ajax({ type: 'POST' })
[11:15:33] <taplar> though i think it's method instead of type.  *goes to the docs*
[11:16:10] <taplar> ah, both are valid
[11:20:29] <mentazoom> how can I append data under each «th»? http://pastebin.com/Dr8cf4gC
[11:20:37] <mentazoom> $(‘#data’).append(data.id); something like that, but I don’t get how to add each data under each th
[11:22:31] <taplar> mentazoom: you'll have to create a row for each data element
[11:23:17] <taplar> you can't just straight append to a table.  all the markup for normal html still applies which you have to generate
[11:25:31] <mentazoom> taplar: something like this? http://pastebin.com/Y7GSryVb
[11:26:25] <taplar> append expects a string, a jQuery object, an Element, or an array of those things
[11:27:21] <taplar> var forExample = 'weee';  $(someselector).append('<tr><td>'+ forExample +'</td></tr>');
[11:27:51] <mentazoom> ah that makes sense, thank you!
[11:59:39] <moldy> hi
[12:00:30] <robertmaxrees> gooooooooooooood morning
[12:06:47] <Viddax> Is this possible to load ajax request for second-tr and onward?
[12:07:01] <robertmaxrees> assuming i understand what you mean, yes.
[12:07:25] <Viddax> I show you what I mean, 1 sec
[12:07:28] <Viddax> I pastebin
[12:07:53] <robertmaxrees> could you use bpaste or literally any other service fwiw?  pastebin suuuucks
[12:10:00] <Viddax> robertmaxrees this is what I mean https://jsfiddle.net/wrh3gjn4/
[12:10:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid html fwiw.
[12:10:56] <robertmaxrees> so what should happen when you click the button?  it adds an entry above it and submits it via ajax?
[12:11:04] <Viddax> <div class="ajax-entries-result"> </div> will load ajax with the result containing <tr> <td> </td> </tr>
[12:11:17] <robertmaxrees> this is still invalid html.
[12:11:18] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[12:11:21] <robertmaxrees> you can do whatever you want.
[12:11:22] <Viddax> robertmaxrees it will reload the ajax
[12:11:29] <Viddax> What is alternative option?
[12:11:34] <Viddax> to be valid html somehow?
[12:11:37] <robertmaxrees> put in valid markup.
[12:11:41] <robertmaxrees> use a td / td
[12:11:42] <robertmaxrees> brb
[12:12:13] <Viddax> But ajax-entries-result will contain some <tr> and <td>
[12:13:13] <taplar> you have ajax-entries-results inside the table
[12:13:17] <taplar> it has to be in a tr td/th
[12:14:09] <Viddax> I see
[12:14:34] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/wrh3gjn4/1/
[12:15:02] <Viddax> Thank you
[12:15:09] <Viddax> ajax-entries-result will contain <table> ?
[12:15:17] <robertmaxrees> no.
[12:15:22] <taplar> it has to contain trs with td/ths
[12:15:23] <robertmaxrees> it'd have your trs/tds
[12:15:28] <Viddax> Ahh I get you.
[12:15:28] <taplar> if you want to put tables in those td/th, sure
[12:15:41] <Viddax> Perfect
[12:15:44] <Viddax> Thanks mate or bro.
[12:15:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:15:56] <taplar> hommie
[12:16:11] <Viddax> lol.
[12:37:43] <catbadger> anyone here worked with leafletjs?
[12:38:37] <taplar> nope, sup?
[12:49:14] <taplar> integration testing is fun
[12:50:09] <Viddax> if I have mulitiple tables eg: <table class="list" data-list-id="1"> </table>  and  <table class="list" data-list-id="2"> </table>
[12:50:23] <Viddax> How do I get all the data-list-id= from .list selector?
[12:50:35] <Viddax> I need to use $.each?
[12:50:47] <taplar> $('.list').map(function(){ return $(this).data('list-id'); })
[12:51:43] <Viddax> I see, thank you.

[16:49:43] <RottenCore> Ahoy
[16:49:52] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[16:51:21] <RottenCore> question: i’ve got this multi-part form: https://www.swiftcomm.co.uk/landing-voip
[16:53:32] <robertmaxrees> that's not a question ;)
[16:54:15] <RottenCore> ha. sorry finding a link
[16:54:22] <robertmaxrees> what's the question?
[16:54:26] <robertmaxrees> instead of linking to things.
[16:54:33] <RottenCore> so that form uses this: http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/jquery-multi-step-form-with-progress-bar
[16:54:38] <RottenCore> what I want to do
[16:54:51] <RottenCore> is have the radio buttons trigger the next portion of the form like the “next” button does
[16:55:00] <RottenCore> but I have no idea how the “next” button actually works
[16:55:22] <robertmaxrees> easy
[16:55:29] <robertmaxrees> look at the js
[16:55:33] <RottenCore> I’m new to jquery. thought I could figure it out on my own but I’m stuck
[16:55:50] <robertmaxrees> so take a quick guess as to which part of the code handles the "next" button.
[16:56:02] <RottenCore> $(".next").click(function(){
[16:56:04] <RottenCore> 	if(animating) return false;
[16:56:04] <RottenCore> 	animating = true;
[16:56:05] <RottenCore> 	
[16:56:08] <robertmaxrees> woah
[16:56:09] <robertmaxrees> heh
[16:56:16] <RottenCore> i’m jus tnot sure how to call that with a form element
[16:56:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah - don't paste in channel pls :)  SO!  break that code down.
[16:56:25] <RottenCore> i’m guessing onclick
[16:56:35] <robertmaxrees> you want change actually.
[16:57:18] <RottenCore> onchange?
[16:57:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:57:37] <robertmaxrees> no.  never use html attributes for that
[16:58:26] <RottenCore> then I’m lost, I thought you had to with form elements
[16:58:41] <robertmaxrees> what gave you that impression? :)
[16:59:11] <RottenCore> something I learned long ago
[16:59:12] <RottenCore> ha
[16:59:16] <RottenCore> that’s likely depricated now
[16:59:21] <robertmaxrees> whatever told you that was wrong.
[16:59:25] <RottenCore> I’ve been out of it for a little while
[16:59:33] <robertmaxrees> you've always been able to use normal event handlers on form elements.
[16:59:40] <RottenCore> well sht. heh
[16:59:52] <RottenCore> so I don’t want to use onChange, how do I call it then?
[17:00:09] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/5fa6689ae0ce
[17:00:12] <robertmaxrees> .on('change')
[17:00:24] <robertmaxrees> jquery's .on() is basically your swiss army knife for all event handlers.
[17:01:09] <robertmaxrees> now $('form').on('change', goToNextQuestion) probably won't work exactly right because the handler references $(this).
[17:01:14] <robertmaxrees> but you should be able to fix that part up yourself.
[17:02:47] <RottenCore> ok lemme give that a try!
[17:03:02] <robertmaxrees> like i said - it make not work out of the box, but you get the idea.
[17:03:13] <RottenCore> where in the radiobutton do I put it?
[17:03:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:03:22] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[17:03:26] <robertmaxrees> you're not changing any html.
[17:03:35] <robertmaxrees> did you see the change i made to the JS?
[17:05:02] <RottenCore> I do
[17:05:08] <RottenCore> so I do nothing to the form?
[17:05:13] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:05:17] <robertmaxrees> you're purely changing js.
[17:05:35] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to update the listener and the callback.
[17:05:39] <RottenCore> ok one more question: will that jack up other form fields? checkboxes, etc
[17:05:47] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[17:05:51] <robertmaxrees> hence you need to update it.
[17:07:03] <RottenCore> now I’ve gotta figure out the listeners. ha
[17:07:27] <RottenCore> the documentation on the script’s page may help
[17:08:55] <Dan39> wow it is satisying when your first interface comes together. all the stuff reacting to your clicks and updating live
[17:10:02] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore fwiw it should be pretty self-explanatory.
[17:10:25] <RottenCore> should be if you know what your’e doing, you mean.haha
[17:10:29] <RottenCore> I’m brand new at this
[17:10:36] <robertmaxrees> so where are you lost, then?
[17:10:48] <robertmaxrees> you've gotten pretty far for somebody who doesn't know what they're doing.
[17:13:35] <z1haze_work> if i have a setup like this: http://dpaste.com/2KWB2J4 how do i get rid of the wrap div but keep the .items
[17:13:43] <z1haze_work> ive tried unwrap but i guess im using it on the wrong element
[17:13:56] <z1haze_work> i tried $('.item').unwrap()
[17:15:00] <taplar> maybe you have to do the unwrap on the parent?  *goes to docs*
[17:15:02] <robertmaxrees> that works here.
[17:15:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jw06e8fg/
[17:15:08] <robertmaxrees>  $('.item').unwrap();
[17:15:21] <RottenCore> robertmaxrees: To be fair a lot of this is copy/paste
[17:15:35] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:15:36] <robertmaxrees> ah
[17:15:38] <RottenCore> i’m good at adapting examples
[17:15:50] <RottenCore> but when it comes to real structural changes I often get lost
[17:15:50] <taplar> good 'ol S.O. programmer
[17:15:56] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:15:58] <robertmaxrees> great time to learn then :)
[17:16:06] <RottenCore> especially if I don’t really understand how it works anyway!
[17:16:10] <RottenCore> oh I’m learning, just not ther eyet
[17:17:59] <robertmaxrees> heh,
[17:19:22] <RottenCore> the part I don’t understand is how it knows next is next and previous is previous
[17:19:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:19:55] <robertmaxrees> jquery 101 ;)
[17:20:08] <robertmaxrees> notice how it has $('.next').click( ?
[17:22:09] <RottenCore> yes
[17:22:15] <robertmaxrees> there's your answer.
[17:22:30] <RottenCore> I know that’s how it works but how does it see the “next” button if we’re not using the html?
[17:22:44] <robertmaxrees> the DOM
[17:22:46] <robertmaxrees> long story short.
[17:22:53] <robertmaxrees> the JS can access the html through the browser.
[17:23:23] <robertmaxrees> jquery maps $('.next') to a native command - something like document.querySelectorAll('.next'); or similar.
[17:23:33] <robertmaxrees> the browser returns those elements and then you can use them
[17:23:51] <RottenCore> right, so the button labeled “next” is listened for
[17:24:07] <robertmaxrees> with 'next' as a class, yes.
[17:24:13] <robertmaxrees> and no "listened fot"
[17:24:13] <RottenCore> so i need to figure out how to make my form radiobuttons also “next” without messing with what they’re doing for the form
[17:24:16] <robertmaxrees> *for
[17:24:18] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[17:24:27] <robertmaxrees> you want to also apply that logic to the radio buttons.
[17:25:09] <robertmaxrees> which is similar to what i did with that $('form').on('change' thinger.
[17:25:51] <RottenCore> right ok
[17:25:53] <RottenCore> I think I got it
[17:26:02] <RottenCore> and that worked!
[17:26:02] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com fwiw
[17:26:04] <RottenCore> oh. kinda.
[17:26:21] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:33:25] <pcfreak30> does wrapAll return the wrapped element or does it actually modify the collection to hold the wrapped element
[17:33:26] <RottenCore> so it kinda works
[17:33:37] <RottenCore> how do I keep the checkboxes from triggering it though?
[17:33:52] <robertmaxrees> RottenCore you want to refine the selector to only target the radios.
[17:33:59] <RottenCore> I added class=“next” to the label of the radio buttons, works great. it’s not added to the checkboxes, but they advance, to
[17:34:14] <RottenCore> robertmaxrees: that’s what I did. it’s weird
[17:34:15] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[17:34:21] <robertmaxrees> don't touch the html.
[17:34:51] <robertmaxrees> see where I'm doing $('form').on('change" ?
[17:35:04] <RottenCore> yes
[17:35:16] <robertmaxrees> you need to update the 'form' part to only target radios in the form
[17:35:42] <RottenCore> ahhhhhh
[17:35:50] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:40:29] <RottenCore> I use type=radio for this, yes?
[17:40:46] <robertmaxrees> clarify?
[17:41:18] <RottenCore> to target the radio buttons i’ll want to target the actual form element, and not the label, yes?
[17:41:32] <robertmaxrees> still not making sense.
[17:41:37] <robertmaxrees> show me what you mean?
[17:42:18] <robertmaxrees> fwiw https://api.jquery.com/radio-selector/
[17:42:22] <robertmaxrees> $('form :radio')
[17:42:26] <robertmaxrees> that's all you need.
[17:42:46] <robertmaxrees> or do $('form input:radio') if you're cool.
[17:43:00] <RottenCore> ah ok
[17:43:07] <robertmaxrees> google's your friend :)
[17:43:51] <jonez> greetings
[17:44:07] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon
[17:44:13] <jonez> RottenCore, in answer to your question: yes, you want to target the input element not the label
[17:45:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:51:24] <RottenCore> I still can’t figure it out. haha
[17:51:34] <robertmaxrees> so what's not working?
[17:51:38] <RottenCore> but I have to go. I’ll be back in a bit to lean on you guys again
[17:51:43] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[17:51:46] <robertmaxrees> check the learning center, to.
[17:51:48] <robertmaxrees> *too
[19:56:26] <Bushwhackers|iad> hi guys, how does one report web bugs in jq.com ?
[20:02:51] <pcfreak30> Can anyone tell me why $('<a />').wrap('<div/>') does not work?
[20:03:07] <taplar> what are you expecting it to do?
[20:14:04] <pcfreak30> trying to wrap the jquery object with the div
[20:15:49] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/hmpg9s0k/
[20:23:13] <mattste_> Hello folks, is there a way to get a proper stack trace in a deferred .catch error handler?
[20:23:52] <mattste_> I don't see any stack trace on the error object passed
[20:26:05] <pcfreak30> taplar: kk so it returns the original element not the wrapper
[20:26:31] <taplar> yep, most if not all jquery methods return the element they operated upon
[20:27:33] <pcfreak30> thoight it might mutate or return the wrapped one
[20:27:49] <taplar> nah
[20:39:22] <nexus2911> would anyone be willing to answer some questions about jshint in regards to gulp?
[21:25:32] <beanah> Is there a way to check if a bootstrap modal is currently open with jquery?
[22:56:40] <sud0x> Hey everyone, trying to get a simple for loop in to iterate through an array but it's not working o.0
[22:56:45] <sud0x> wondering if someone can take a quick look
[22:57:06] <sud0x> http://pastebin.com/KZMVPPQ8
[22:57:09] <taplar> remove "Array"
[22:57:33] <tectonic> remove "Array"
[22:57:37] <tectonic> dang
[22:59:59] <sud0x> lol you guys are fast
[23:00:10] <taplar> you also have an extra ')' after the function() part
[23:00:44] <sud0x> ok removed array but now i don't get anything back from console.log
[23:00:49] <sud0x> this for loop breaks my code
[23:01:02] <taplar> you remove the extra ')' ?
[23:01:06] <sud0x> yea
[23:01:27] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/y9oke0z6/
[23:01:36] <sud0x> honestly all i want to do is print that array and the numbers, so i guess skip one in the iteration
[23:01:43] <sud0x> would that be too hard to do?
[23:01:56] <taplar> skip which one?
[23:02:23] <sud0x> i dont want to see the color names (blue/red)
[23:02:27] <sud0x> just want to see the numbers
[23:02:32] <sud0x> the array will always be even
[23:03:22] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/y9oke0z6/1/
[23:03:48] <sud0x> you're the man taplar
[23:04:02] <sud0x> I don't think I've ever received this good of help on irc -- much appreciated!
[23:04:10] <taplar> np
[23:04:23] <taplar> you understand what it is doing?
[23:05:04] <sud0x> ya, getting each value that's disivible by two
[23:05:24] <taplar> has a remainder, so not divisible by 2
[23:06:05] <taplar> % is modulus, which gives you the remainder of a division operation
[23:06:34] <sud0x> oh ok
[23:06:48] <sud0x> sweet, going to read up on that
[23:14:35] <sud0x> thanks agai taplar :)
[23:14:38] <sud0x> again*
[23:16:00] <bomb> taplar even solves problems asked when he wasn't here.
[23:16:14] <taplar> :D
