[09:29:05] <Phruis> robertmaxrees i figured it out
[09:29:15] <Phruis> completely unrelated to anything
[09:29:21] <Phruis> my own stupidity mostly
[11:29:33] <nnyby> where do i get the latest build for jquery-ui? I see there's been some activity on github.
[11:29:44] <nnyby> Or, how do i build this myself? there are no instructions on the readme.
[12:34:51] <robertmaxrees> nnyby you mean, like, the latest release?
[12:40:56] <nnyby> no, i mean the code built with all the latest changes on git
[12:41:10] <nnyby> later than the latest release (which is from 2016) :P
[12:41:25] <robertmaxrees> downside is that might not be the most stable build :)
[12:42:16] <robertmaxrees> i meann, you can download the repo and build it yourself: https://i.imgur.com/tzZIiyF.png
[12:42:17] <nnyby> i understand.. an unstable build is what i'm looking for >_<
[12:42:29] <robertmaxrees> whatcha need an unstable build for??
[12:43:00] <nnyby> cool, i just don't see instructions anywhere on how to build it myself, but i guess i'll try and figure it out
[12:43:56] <nnyby> well, i'm building a revamped version of an application that uses jquery-ui's spinner tool. I just want the latest version of jquery-ui possible, to iron out any potential browser compatibility problems. a lot has changed in 4 years.
[12:44:33] <robertmaxrees> eh - i'd be careful with that heh.
[12:44:36] <robertmaxrees> unstable build and all :)
[12:45:30] <nnyby> you're saying you'd strongly recommend sticking with the released version of jquery ui?
[12:45:57] <nnyby> i mean, that's what i'll likely do. I was just curious about trying out the unstable build, if only out of curiosity... see if it instroduced issues
[12:46:11] <nnyby> if it did... i could help report them >_< i mean, release early and often, after all
[12:47:45] <robertmaxrees> Didn't say that, either :)
[12:48:15] <robertmaxrees> Just that using something pre-release comes with a host of other bugs and headaches.  Pre-release isn't ready for production use, so it comes with bugs.
[12:48:20] <nnyby> what are you saying, then? be careful with relying on jquery-ui in the first place?
[12:49:25] <robertmaxrees> Basically.  If you can get away with a migration to something else, it might be time for that, at least for now.  jqui was supposed to go under a major rearchitecting a while back.
[12:50:02] <nnyby> got it. yeah, last i checked a year or so ago i remember that's where things were at. i know maintenance burden is a lot.
[12:50:13] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i'd stick with the older version and wait for the next release.  otherwise you're basically forking the repo and then modifying it in in ways that'll make future jqui updates difficult to integrate.
[12:50:24] <nnyby> i was just excited to see some activity in the github repo.. hoping that possibly jqui had got some renewed support after all
[12:51:19] <robertmaxrees> Looks like a lot of core library updates.
