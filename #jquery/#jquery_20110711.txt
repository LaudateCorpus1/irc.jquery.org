[00:16:42] <jomofcw> Hi !
[00:16:55] <Paveloosha> Hello..
[00:46:48] <[1]bob> Hi folks, I have a problem with the Jquery Form Plugin, I'm tryin' to use the .ajaxSubmit(options), but when I submit I don't have te message from the beforeSubmit or success
[00:47:08] <thinkster> how do you select <a rel='something' hef='google.com' /></a> ?
[00:47:31] <thinkster> a:rel(somthing) ?
[00:48:01] <jrockjiggz> a[rel="something"]
[00:48:10] <JKarsrud> $('a[rel="something"]);
[00:48:18] <JKarsrud> $('a[rel="something"]'); even
[00:48:26] <jrockjiggz> note: attribute selectors are of the slowest.
[00:48:38] <thinkster> thx
[00:49:02] <thinkster> jrockjiggz, hmm, I am using lightbox.  Is there a better way?
[00:49:09] <thinkster> lightbox plugin
[00:49:31] <jrockjiggz> u'll be ok -
[00:50:42] <JKarsrud> it's not that slow if it uses qsa, and you'd need a lot of elements for you to really notice
[00:50:46] <thinkster> is there a better one than lightbox,  cause I can't get it working anyway.  I just need to use images, not div's or anything
[00:51:06] <thinkster> $("a[rel='lightbox-mygallery']").lightbox();
[00:51:06] <JKarsrud> you have fancybox, even though that supports more than images
[00:51:18] <thinkster> yeah, you are right, fancybox is easier
[00:51:36] <thinkster> I had it working, but then it broke on me, so I though maybe this would be easier, but it isn't
[00:51:41] <JKarsrud> are you sure you've loaded the script right?
[00:51:44] <thinkster> the instruction are brief
[00:52:01] <JKarsrud> because that should work..
[00:52:03] <thinkster> JKarsrud, let me try again, brb
[00:52:20] <JKarsrud> sure :)
[00:52:41] <JKarsrud> you could make a jsfiddle or post on pastebin too, if you have any isses
[00:53:16] <[1]bob> Using Jquery Form Plugin when I .ajaxSubmit(options) It doesn't get me the beforeSubmit or success messages, any ideas to solve that ?
[00:54:28] <[1]bob> nvm I solved my problem -_-'
[00:58:55] <thinkster> lightbox has a link that shows up at the top right corner, how do you remove it?
[00:59:17] <thinkster> JKarsrud, hehe, I got it going, you were right, I didn't load the script
[00:59:34] <JKarsrud> thinkster cool cool ;)
[00:59:41] <JKarsrud> yeah, that would be the close button
[00:59:54] <JKarsrud> you could just display:none; it in your CSS :)
[01:00:12] <JKarsrud> I don't know what the markup of lightbox looks like, but you can remove it for sure :)
[01:00:19] <JKarsrud> Or maybe you can config it away =)
[01:02:42] <thinkster> hmm, the close button is cool, but above it there is a link to lightbox
[01:03:37] <JKarsrud> hmm, do you have a live example?
[01:06:21] <Ely2> Hi, when I request a flickr api via JSON I get the following error: Can't find variable: jsonFlickrApi
[01:06:33] <Ely2> that variable is only inside the json file and not used in the jquery script
[01:07:04] <b23> Hi, I have a lot of inline JS on my page and I want to get all of this in a singe .js file. Is there an advice how I can load only the parts of JS which is needed for the page?
[01:07:16] <b23> *single
[01:08:27] <spliter> b23: you might want to use something like a resource loader. Like yepnope.js. Standalone or as part of Modernizr2
[01:08:47] <thinkster> JKarsrud, its the one for download, the demo
[01:09:14] <JKarsrud> oh, I've never seen that before
[01:09:16] <thinkster> JKarsrud, but don't bother, let me try some more first, I'll probably get, and if not, I'll come back and trouble you
[01:09:23] <b23> spliter, ok I'm looking at this thanks
[01:09:23] <JKarsrud> cool :)
[01:09:48] <spliter> you're welcome b23

[01:14:47] <aaronmcadam> np jrockjiggz what u trying to do anyway?
[01:15:06] <PrinceES> just having a little issue on adding and loading external div "slider"
[01:15:10] <PrinceES> on my code
[01:15:16] <jrockjiggz> just studying javascript...
[01:15:29] <aaronmcadam> kk
[01:17:33] <thinkster> If you create image link on the fly, like if you have a button, that display images using jquery append. And then suppose you wanted to use lightbox() on those images.  Would you have to do $('slecter').lightbox().live();?
[01:19:24] <jrockjiggz> thinkster: if you invoke your jQuery query after the dom has been manipulated then you don' t need live (if its there before you call upon it), so $('select').lightbox() will work fine.. if you manipulate the select after the plugin has been called, then its up to the plugin to handle changes
[01:19:58] <jrockjiggz> btw your example would not work live doesnt work like that
[01:21:03] <thinkster> jrockjiggz, yeah, I tried it didn't work.  I don't really know what live is about really.  But I had another case, where I was adding elements, and had to use live to get things working

[01:24:29] <thinkster> I am gonna try fancybox(), I got it working for appended elements
[01:34:36] <aaronmcadam> jrockjiggz, noooo the magical __proto__ property! Here be dragonssss
[01:36:56] <L4suicide> how do I select all <td>s which contain links with a certain href (i want to use a[href^='page.php?example=1'])
[01:37:09] <aaronmcadam> then do it the other way round
[01:37:15] <aaronmcadam> do that selector.closest('td')
[01:38:52] <L4suicide> wooohoo, much easier than I thought lol
[01:39:00] <L4suicide> thanks

[01:41:08] <Cradam> anyone know something which makes a box bigger in jquery?
[01:41:17] <Cradam> bigger on hover
[01:41:17] <aaronmcadam> ?
[01:41:31] <jrockjiggz> Cradam: bigger()
[01:41:34] <Cradam> similar to the mac bar
[01:41:43] <eml> Cradam: Can't CSS do that for you?
[01:41:46] <jrockjiggz> jk
[01:41:58] <jrockjiggz> theres no bigger() function..
[01:42:18] <Cradam> eml: yes but with what i want to do after it is bigger is make it so when a user clicks on it it opens a box thing
[01:43:13] <eml> Then you want to trigger the mouseover event I suppose
[01:44:06] <Cradam> i guess css animation will be good for making it bigger
[01:47:49] <PrinceES> may you please help me out .... http://samirayousefi.com/jsslider/index.html    ?? Only having problem while loading an external div "slider" on my code
[01:52:31] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, what is the problem?
[01:54:18] <PrinceES> unable to load slider div under the showcase div
[01:54:30] <PrinceES> have you look on it ...http://jsfiddle.net/JLdtB/4/
[01:55:47] <Paveloosha> @<jrockjiggz>, you may set size of the box with .width() and .height()
[01:56:12] <PrinceES> <Paveloosha> everything works if i insert data manually under the showcase div....
[01:56:46] <PrinceES> but having problem when i insert data through another div "slider"...
[01:56:48] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>,I looked into, I can see some low opacity boxes..
[01:57:00] <PrinceES> such as ?
[01:57:25] <Paveloosha> "watch the races here"
[01:58:11] <pen> how do I share the function or variables across script tags or even coffeescript tags?
[01:58:16] <PrinceES> because of slider div data wouldnt load under the showcase div
[01:58:42] <PrinceES> if i put data manually... without using slider div
[01:58:43] <pen> right now the function or event I defined in an external script will not work in the inline script tag in the html file
[01:58:50] <pen> how do I share them?
[01:58:50] <Paveloosha> Can you show me the code you are using?
[01:59:02] <PrinceES> then it works and load data and everything
[01:59:21] <PrinceES> you mean to say ... a plugin?

[02:00:49] <PrinceES> actually, there is no way to fetching data through an xml .... therefore, i had to write another part of code over it for fetching xml data and displaying them into the div "showcase"
[02:01:08] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, try using that plugin after Ajax load..
[02:01:21] <aaronmcadam> PrinceES, you need to parse the xml
[02:01:44] <aaronmcadam> or us YQL to return your data as JSON
[02:01:48] <aaronmcadam> use*
[02:02:35] <PrinceES> but i can see all xml data are fetching through the script what i have added
[02:02:47] <PrinceES> i also tried with parse the xml
[02:02:58] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, use that plugin after loading data..
[02:03:05] <PrinceES> you can see on here
[02:03:06] <PrinceES> http://jsfiddle.net/gA3ef/9/
[02:03:19] <Paveloosha> I can see you used that before ajax call
[02:03:28] <PrinceES> ok.. i am going to add that plugin code after the loading data
[02:03:38] <Paveloosha> try that
[02:03:50] <Paveloosha> I can see your data is loading..
[02:05:41] <PrinceES> i tried what you suggested me to do... but the result is the same like as before..... have you a look on it... http://jsfiddle.net/JLdtB/7/
[02:06:33] <pen> anyone know?
[02:06:41] <pen> how to share between external script and inline script?
[02:07:16] <Paveloosha> Okay I am looking on
[02:07:24] <PrinceES> <Paveloosha> yap.. data is loading into both set of codes.... but just having a problem for displaying them under the showcase div

[02:58:41] <PrinceES> yes. i am
[02:58:53] <PrinceES> sorry. i was out of desk
[02:59:03] <Paveloosha> why are using "slider" div!!
[02:59:12] <Paveloosha> why are you?
[03:00:55] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, !!
[03:01:06] <PrinceES> because i want to show the append div code inside the showcase div
[03:01:23] <PrinceES> therefore, i have created another div called slider
[03:01:38] <PrinceES> and putting it appened code inside the div showcase
[03:02:21] <Paveloosha> if you append them inpto your 'showcase' div, problem is solved !!!!
[03:04:20] <PrinceES> nope...
[03:04:22] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, isn't it !!
[03:04:26] <Paveloosha> why?
[03:04:32] <PrinceES> but ,.. let me try once again
[03:04:36] <PrinceES> for making sure about it
[03:04:50] <jigal> how can i add parameters to my url with jquery
[03:05:26] <PrinceES> nope,.....
[03:05:29] <Paveloosha> @jigal, didn't understand!!
[03:05:39] <PrinceES> becuase this showcase div has to be out of the loop
[03:05:42] <Paveloosha> why not?
[03:05:47] <PrinceES> it will call just once
[03:06:04] <jigal> Paveloosha: i want to add parameters to my url and then submit my url
[03:07:08] <PrinceES> as you can see i am using each funtion for calling the xml result....
[03:07:13] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, just replace $('#slider').append(..........)   to $('#showcase').append(..........)
[03:07:25] <PrinceES> and this showcase div has to be out of it
[03:07:53] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, just replace $('#slider').append(..........)   to $('#showcase').append(..........) and it will work....
[03:08:53] <PrinceES> ok....
[03:09:36] <Paveloosha> @<jigal>, when you are calling a URl, call it like this "http.www.google.com?myparam=myparamvalue"
[03:10:11] <PrinceES> yes....
[03:10:14] <PrinceES> i tried..
[03:10:16] <PrinceES> but it is the same
[03:10:26] <Paveloosha> @<jigal>, *http://
[03:10:31] <PrinceES> same way that we used slider div
[03:10:35] <jigal> Paveloosha: i have an existing url in my url box but i want to add parameters which are comming from radio buttons
[03:10:53] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, please show me..
[03:10:57] <jigal> so i select an option and then i want to add to my url general=baz
[03:11:00] <jigal> for example
[03:11:10] <PrinceES> $.parseXML is not a function
[03:11:11] <PrinceES> [Break On This Error] var the_xmldoc = $.parseXML(the_data);
[03:11:23] <aaronmcadam> PrinceES, you can use selectors
[03:11:45] <aaronmcadam> haha you're guessing method names, u must be desparate
[03:11:50] <PrinceES> noooo
[03:11:57] <PrinceES> ignore this above error
[03:12:19] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, logically my suggesstion should work ..
[03:12:27] <PrinceES> i was trying to another script in which am i using this $.parseXML(the_data)
[03:13:43] <guy> what do you think guys?
[03:13:44] <guy> http://anuary.com/dev/hp/pad3/
[03:13:46] <guy> pretty nice animation, isn't? : )
[03:13:47] <PrinceES> but rendering are the same
[03:13:55] <Paveloosha> @<jigal>, "http://www.google.com?myparam="+general
[03:14:32] <PrinceES> weather am i using slider div or showcase div :(
[03:14:36] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, can you show me?
[03:15:19] <PrinceES> http://pastebin.com/JumQZ1Xt
[03:15:21] <PrinceES> see
[03:16:24] <jigal> Paveloosha: don't understand
[03:17:14] <Paveloosha> @<jigal>, you need to pass a value to your url right?
[03:17:26] <jigal> right with jquery.

[03:20:55] <amcsi_work> I am a bit confused about the deferreds' when functions
[03:23:06] <amcsi_work> according to the manual, on ajax, the argument passed to the success callback at "when()" is an array, whereas in this stackoverflow article, the success callback is passed the contents of that array: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5921283/understanding-jquery-deferred-pipe
[03:23:45] <Paveloosha> @<jigal>, window.location = "http://www.google.com?myparam="+your variable

[03:25:52] <PrinceES> nope.... still not working actually, $('#showcase').append('</div>'); .. this following line is to close the div of <div class="showcase-slide">... therefore, there are 2 divs at the end ...
[03:26:28] <PrinceES> and it has to be under the loop
[03:27:01] <PrinceES> because it is sets of the code.. that is generate the layout for each image and its thumbnail on the slider

[03:27:57] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, forget about plugin.. just append them inpto "showcase" div..
[03:28:05] <amcsi_work> or with "when()" does it always execute the "then()" callbacks with argument arrays, and with the case of "pipe()", the arguments normally?
[03:28:23] <Innocentus> I want to prevent the download of images in a div container
[03:28:23] <Paveloosha> can you pdo that??
[03:28:28] <Innocentus> I mean the images are placed as HTML-img-Tags but I don't want that they are downloaded
[03:28:32] <Innocentus> I need this for a preloader implementation
[03:28:33] <Innocentus> anyone? :D
[03:28:48] <Innocentus> dr0id: so is it possible with js?
[03:29:00] <PrinceES> <Paveloosha>  i did already but ..... still wouldnt work at all:( .. but here it works http://www.samirayousefi.com/jsslider/ ...
[03:29:04] <dr0id> no
[03:29:08] <dr0id> it is not
[03:30:45] <Paveloosha> @<Innocentus>, nope..
[03:31:37] <Innocentus> damn
[03:31:41] <Innocentus> but how can I do it then?
[03:32:06] <PrinceES> I also discussed my present problem into the official blog of this plugin but .. they dont reply to noone...
[03:32:07] <Innocentus> if visibility: hidden; , would the browser then don't download the image(s)?
[03:32:21] <PrinceES> i really dont know what should i do :(
[03:32:31] <PrinceES> for fixing this tiny bug
[03:32:32] <PrinceES> :(
[03:33:32] <Innocentus> Paveloosha: would hiding the images with css (visibility: hidden;) prevent the problem?
[03:34:44] <Paveloosha> Nope..
[03:35:51] <shrys> Any reason why a statement would work in Firebug but wouldn't work from script ?
[03:36:13] <PrinceES> i think now i should give up this plugin finally :(
[03:36:29] <PrinceES> because there is no way to display result via XMl
[03:37:07] <misterm> shrys: lot's of reasons...my guess would be some sort of timing or scope issue
[03:37:51] <PrinceES> <Paveloosha>what do you think?
[03:37:53] <amcsi_work> is it correct that the arguments I get for $.ajax().success and $.ajax().done are $.ajax().success(function (data, textStatus, jqXHR) { ... }) and  $.ajax().done(function ([data, textStatus, jqXHR]) { ... })  respectively?
[03:38:12] <amcsi_work> that basically done() gives me the argiments packed in an array?
[03:39:23] <Innocentus> Innocentus
[03:39:39] <Innocentus> Paveloosha: so I have to add the images manually one by one with jquery, right?
[03:39:48] <Innocentus> Paveloosha: can't I prevent the download somehow
[03:40:17] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, wait..
[03:41:00] <Paveloosha> @<Innocentus>, you cant prevent downloading it..
[03:41:09] <shrys> misterm:  Hmm.. Will look into it. Thanks !
[03:41:24] <Innocentus> Paveloosha: I don't want to protect them from being downloaded by human users
[03:41:39] <Innocentus> Paveloosha: I only want to start the download individually one by one for a preload
[03:41:44] <Innocentus> Paveloosha: sequential preload
[03:45:03] <Innocentus> Paveloosha: ok, alternative I will try to add the images one by one with jquery
[03:45:24] <Innocentus> Paveloosha: but then I would like to add a dummies into the div which aren't seen by the user but can store the image url
[03:45:34] <Innocentus> Paveloosha: is that at least possible with html / javascript?
[03:48:22] <kollapse> Hi. I have a little issue with UI's buttonset feature. If I have too many buttons and a new line is introduced, then the entire set starts looking ugly (no vertical spacing, lack of corner rounding) Like this - http://simplest-image-hosting.net/jpeg-0-ch3 Any way to fix this so it looks fine ?
[03:48:39] <PrinceES> <Paveloosha>  ok... i am waiting for a solution :( but really thanks alot for your help... and i hope we will have a solution
[03:51:37] <samtihen> hey, having a really weird issue / conflict with a getJSON call and a window.location.href redirect...  but it takes a couple of steps to reproduce... first, go to http://myscubadives.com/ ... then... use the button on the right to connect with facebook (you have to give it permission). it should sign you in, create an ccount, etc.. all that should work. now, sign out of facebook, and refresh the myscubadives.com site to ensure you are signed out. now, 
[03:52:59] <Guest_> does jquery post work for sending images to php?
[03:53:30] <Guest_> harro?
[03:55:11] <Guest_> ground control to major Tom...
[03:55:35] <misterm> Guest_: you won't always get an answer right away, just ask your question and if someone can anwser they will

[03:56:06] <Guest_> increment bowie on click
[03:56:08] <Guest_> lal
[03:56:12] <misterm> Guest_: but it depends on what you mean by "sending images"

[03:57:53] <amcsi_work> I'm confused guys, about deferred stuff. Check out this stackoverflow page: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5921283/understanding-jquery-deferred-pipe
[03:57:55] <Guest_> ok, to be more specific, im sending a load of form data to a php script. one of the form inputs is type="file". will this make jquery implode, or do i just have to specify a dataType or somat
[03:58:15] <amcsi_work> in the second row, isn't dara.returnCode supposed to be data[0].returnCode?
[03:58:36] <[1]bob> Hi guys, when I submit my form using ajaxSubmit, I got a response from the server 200 OK
[03:58:37] <[1]bob> 		367ms
[03:58:50] <amcsi_work> because the documentation says the ajax arguments passed are packed into an array
[03:58:59] <[1]bob> but success isn't called ?
[03:59:06] <happynoff> Hi there, what would be the best way to split a set of elements by 5 ? To act on groups of 5 elements. thanks
[03:59:21] <Guest_> hmm. looks like its noob hour. ill ask later I suppose
[03:59:26] <aaronmcadam> hahaha
[03:59:48] <aaronmcadam> are you sending them as base64
[04:00:11] <aaronmcadam> ah file inputs ok
[04:01:36] <aaronmcadam> there's a plugin for ajax file uploads Guest_
[04:01:47] <aaronmcadam> check on Zurb's website
[04:02:13] <PrinceES> <Paveloosha> are you here?
[04:02:20] <Whirl3d> hey all. Quick question: how do you get rid of the stupid highlight around focused input elements?
[04:02:22] <KingDosser> Hey Guys. I am having a bit of trouble with what I think are non asynchronous ajax calls overwriting eachother.
[04:02:47] <misterm> lol, double negative
[04:02:59] <Innocentus> lol
[04:03:20] <Guest_> yeah, can't use a plugin aaron. its gotta be hand-milked. ill just write the php and see what i get serverside
[04:03:22] <Guest_> :/
[04:03:51] <aaronmcadam> why can't u use a plugin
[04:03:51] <KingDosser> Coldhead, you around bro?
[04:04:01] <Whirl3d> is hand-milked like knuckle-glazed?
[04:05:03] <Guest_> using other peoples plugins means adding heavy, bug-ridden code. its gotta be light and custom built
[04:05:11] <aaronmcadam> wtf are u on about
[04:05:24] <aaronmcadam> zurb are one of the best UI companies in the world
[04:05:42] <misterm> Guest_: I think that's dubious reasoning, but suit yourself
[04:05:43] <Whirl3d> Guest_ then why use jQuery? I mean, why don't you just stick with javascript?
[04:05:44] <aaronmcadam> I'm sure it's been tested
[04:06:07] <aaronmcadam> why don't u use the JavaScript plugin for jQuery?
[04:06:16] <Whirl3d> lol
[04:06:24] <aaronmcadam> and the add plugin? it's amazing
[04:06:30] <Guest_> halal. yeah, well theres a limit. gotta use jquery, gotta get down on friday, but gotta write some code yourself
[04:06:35] <aaronmcadam> Whirl3d, 1.add(2), it's great
[04:07:09] <aaronmcadam> there's a reason to use plugins, they can handle edge cases for example
[04:07:15] <misterm> Guest_: yea, but this is the sort of thing where it's generally better not to reinvent the wheel, file uploads is pretty well covered
[04:07:18] <KingDosser> If i set async false on an ajax call. What does that mean in terms of another ajax call called directly after it?
[04:08:28] <Guest_> ok, to give it some setting, the client wants to be able to drag and drop the order of images, i need to find dimensions, file types, file weights, all bundles with other data. there is no plugin that does exactly what i want
[04:08:41] <Guest_> id have to use flickr or some shit just to get close
[04:09:04] <Guest_> bundled*
[04:09:39] <misterm> Guest_: there's a lot of different plugins, and most are fairly extensible...you should be able to build on one of them
[04:09:53] <Innocentus> QUESTION: Can I preload an image and getting the current progress (bytes downloaded, bytes to download) in a callback function?
[04:09:58] <Innocentus> can JQuery do such things?
[04:10:07] <Guest_> nope, learn flash
[04:10:26] <PrinceES> Anyone please have a look into my code.. and fix my problem http://samirayousefi.com/jsslider/ ... it doesnt work ... but here is works ...http://samirayousefi.com/jsslider/index1.html
[04:10:53] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, your problem has been solved..
[04:10:54] <misterm> KingDosser: the second won't start until the first finishes, it's generally better to avoid synchronous requests if possible
[04:10:59] <PrinceES> really ?
[04:11:04] <PrinceES> you did it?
[04:11:21] <Paveloosha> yes
[04:11:26] <PrinceES> I am so surpised to know it
[04:11:27] <PrinceES> wow
[04:11:31] <PrinceES> thanks alot
[04:11:40] <PrinceES> you really did wonderful job
[04:11:49] <PrinceES> can you please show me...how did you do that
[04:11:55] <keirlav> im trying to make it so that once an option has been selected from a html select, it locks itself by adding attr disabled on change, however this is causing an empty string to be posted, can anyone please tell me why this is?
[04:12:00] <Paveloosha> may be there is some style problem but I hope you can manage them
[04:13:42] <mneimne> hey guys is there a jquery image slider and when an image is pressed it opens a light box that displays images from a gallery
[04:13:43] <mneimne> ?
[04:13:58] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, http://pastebin.com/Kjg5kyhk
[04:15:32] <keirlav> can anyone help pls, how to stop an empty string being posted from a select that has attr disabled?
[04:16:02] <alexn> keirlav do you need it disabled? a solution is to set it as readonly
[04:16:05] <aaronmcadam> what do u want
[04:16:17] <Paveloosha> @<PrinceES>, got the New script?
[04:18:32] <keirlav> select doesn't have attr read only :(
[04:19:01] <mneimne> anyone has a link to a good image slider
[04:19:54] <ckoekemoer> hey i got 3 h3 tags inside a div i want to select one h3 animate the opacity, then select the next,h3 so forth and so on, could someone point me in the right direction?
[04:20:08] <PrinceES> yes... i got the script .. and it seems work
[04:20:09] <PrinceES> :)
[04:20:22] <Paveloosha> :)
[04:20:33] <alexn> ah, did not see that youre using select
[04:21:47] <keirlav> ckoekemoer use $('h3:nth-child(1)) - $('h3:nth-child(2)) etc
[04:21:56] <ckoekemoer> thanks
[04:22:24] <keirlav> alexn no problem, i think the solution is just to pass the value of the disabled select to a hidden input and post that instead
[04:22:31] <keirlav> extra markup which i hate but never mind :P
[04:22:51] <sean`> Ely2: pvt?
[04:23:02] <Ely2> sure
[04:27:54] <jigal> how can i submit an url with jquery (a propper http request)
[04:28:11] <jigal> no ajax
[04:29:12] <aaronmcadam> haha
[04:29:16] <aaronmcadam> don't intercept it then
[04:29:23] <misterm> jigal: what do you mean by "submit"?
[04:30:01] <jigal> mistern i have an url which i want to send to my server just like you type it into your url bar
[04:30:06] <jigal> misterm:
[04:30:32] <misterm> jigal: ok, but what do you want to happen on the client side, and why no ajax?
[04:30:42] <jigal> $.post(url) creates an ajax request
[04:30:50] <jigal> but i want it to appear in my url box
[04:30:57] <jigal> like i am making a total new request
[04:30:59] <jigal> misterm:
[04:31:15] <misterm> jigal: so you just want to take them to the url?
[04:31:25] <jigal> misterm: yes
[04:31:36] <Raverix> jigal: window.location = url;
[04:32:02] <Raverix> Or do some research into HTML5 pushstate
[04:32:24] <Raverix> (If you're doing AJAX)
[04:33:53] <[1]bob> Hi, when using ajaxSubmit I got a POST response from the server with X-Json informations, but the success callback isn't triggered any ideas ?
[04:39:56] <Raverix> [1]bob: Maybe something went wrong?
[04:40:27] <Raverix> Did you check the error / complete callbacks?
[04:40:31] <keirlav> what is inside your success callback at the  moment, its definately not just an error with the function?
[04:43:05] <[1]bob> success: showResponse with an alert('hello') inside
[04:43:26] <[1]bob> Raverix, how can I check error/complete callbacks ??
[04:43:30] <Raverix> [1]bob: 1) Please pastebin the ajax call with the function.
[04:44:00] <Raverix> [1]bob: 2) Same way you did a success callback, you can define an error callback, and a complete callback.
[04:44:04] <Raverix> (Check the docs on how)
[04:44:13] <Raverix> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[04:44:41] <[1]bob> I tried the error one earlier, It gave me a 200 Code
[04:44:42] <Raverix> I lied.
[04:44:57] <Raverix> This link: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[04:45:09] <[1]bob> There you go http://pastebin.com/LCzfrejF
[04:46:22] <Raverix> Comment out var queryString = $.param(formData);
[04:46:38] <Raverix> Nevermind
[04:47:00] <Raverix> Comment out document.getElementById("2").style.display = "block";
[04:47:18] <Raverix> Just to test.
[04:47:32] <Raverix> I still think you should define a complete callback and check what's going on there.
[04:49:08] <[1]bob> I commented out the var same results
[04:49:27] <[1]bob> I don't even get inside the function
[04:50:33] <juria_roberts> How to send an array in a querystring
[04:50:35] <juria_roberts> ?
[04:51:03] <juria_roberts> my query string is this
[04:51:05] <juria_roberts> http://testadmin.skenzo.com/cm/customizeTemplate/testfile.php?customElements[]=BackgroundColor^background-color^
[04:51:21] <juria_roberts> wait sorry
[04:51:29] <juria_roberts> i realize my my mistake
[04:51:41] <[1]bob> Ok I tried with the error callback, it says 200 and for alert(thrownError); it says "undefined"
[04:53:08] <[1]bob> And I got inside the Complete callback too
[04:54:15] <[1]bob> Raverix, no errors and I got inside the complete callback ( I put an alert there), do I need to test something else ?
[04:54:36] <SpinachHead> hmmm when using jquery ui datepicker and the icon option where is this path relative to?
[04:56:05] <kevinSJ> Can I only show some elements that don't have a child with the text "0". Is it possible to do that with a oneline selector?
[04:56:51] <Raverix> [1]bob: The error callback is called?
[04:57:08] <[1]bob> Raverix, yes
[04:57:18] <stianhj> kevinSJ: something like this perhaps $('all elements').each(function() { if($(this).html() == 0) $(this).hide() });
[04:57:22] <Raverix> [1]bob: And we've solved one mystery.
[04:57:32] <stianhj> kevinSJ: == "0"
[04:57:51] <Raverix> Complete is called if the request is failed or successful. Error is ONLY called if failed. Success is ONLY called if successful.
[04:57:58] <stianhj> kevinSJ: or wait, != "0" then hide
[04:58:01] <[1]bob> Why does it failed then ??
[04:58:03] <Raverix> So if you're error callback is being called, you have an error.
[04:58:09] <Raverix> [1]bob: That's the next mystery.
[04:58:14] <kevinSJ> stianhj, Perfect. That was what I was looking for :)
[04:58:31] <[1]bob> alert(thrownError); tells "undefined"
[04:58:48] <SpinachHead> ah, it is relative to your page...
[04:58:53] <Raverix> error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[04:59:05] <Raverix> Dyslexic, or typo?
[04:59:48] <[1]bob> nah it's something I found on google ^^
[05:00:25] <Raverix> Simplify your ajax.
[05:00:36] <Raverix> Get rid of target, dataType, beforeSubmit.
[05:01:12] <lkeijser> hi, i have a jquery selector for a certain class. When the page loads for the first time, everything works fine. But when i re-generate the elements (using javascript), none of the newly generated items have the selector applied.
[05:01:40] <[1]bob> Omg it worked  Raverix :)
[05:02:20] <Raverix> lkeijser: 'have the selector applied'
[05:02:27] <Raverix> Selectors aren't 'applied'.
[05:02:36] <Raverix> Using a selector, you can 'select' elements.
[05:02:36] <[1]bob> It's the 'json' that isn't workin' dunno why :s
[05:02:53] <Raverix> [1]bob: Don't know, check docs carefully.
[05:03:06] <[1]bob> K thanks a lot buddy ;)
[05:03:34] <Raverix> lkeijser: What are you trying to do?
[05:04:01] <lkeijser> Raverix: i'm using Qtip to apply tooltips for certain classes
[05:04:31] <Raverix> I'm not familiar with Qtip.
[05:04:41] <Raverix> But if you need to run a function on newly generated elements....
[05:05:04] <Raverix> Then you just run your functions on the newly generated code.
[05:06:42] <lkeijser> Raverix: it's a list of 10 items   <input class="tip" id="1"> ... unil  id=10 , each time the same class
[05:07:18] <lkeijser> Raverix: when i regenerate the list, the tooltip won't appear anymore so i guess this is because the selector isn't applied afterwards
[05:07:27] <lkeijser> oh .. you just typed all that, kind of :)
[05:07:54] <Raverix> "because the selector isn't applied" - Selectors are not applied.
[05:08:00] <Raverix> jQuery is NOT css.
[05:08:10] <Raverix> You do not just set up 'rules' and they work forever.
[05:08:28] <Raverix> jQuery executes when you have it execute, makes it's changes, and then that's it.
[05:08:52] <rogeruiz> lkeijser: Are you changing the text of the li or just adding the li's in?
[05:08:54] <Raverix> It sounds like what you need to do is after you regenerate your list, run your javascript again.
[05:09:29] <ckoekemoer> can anyone tell me why
[05:09:31] <ckoekemoer>   1 function headflash(count){
[05:09:32] <ckoekemoer>   2 var count;
[05:09:34] <ckoekemoer>   3 if (count<=4){
[05:09:36] <ckoekemoer>   4 $('#header h3:nth-child('+count+')').animate({
[05:09:37] <ckoekemoer>   5 'opacity':'1'
[05:09:39] <ckoekemoer>   6 },10000).delay(30000);
[05:09:40] <ckoekemoer>   7 count++
[05:09:41] <Raverix> ckoekemoer: pastebin.com
[05:09:42] <ckoekemoer>   8 headflash(count);
[05:09:43] <ckoekemoer>   9 };
[05:09:45] <ckoekemoer>  10 }
[05:09:46] <ckoekemoer> animates all the h3 tags at the same time?
[05:10:12] <nail_> because animate returns immediately
[05:10:13] <Raverix> ckoekemoer: pastebin.com, never post more than 2 lines of code in here.
[05:10:14] <ckoekemoer> oh sorry
[05:10:21] <ckoekemoer> didn't know
[05:10:32] <nail_> if you want to chain them, you'll need to re-call headflash() in the animate's callback
[05:11:17] <Raverix> ckoekemoer: Not a problem, but for future reference, not posting code rule is universal to almost all IRC channels.
[05:11:29] <kollapse> Hi. How do I make a certain piece of code execute only after a jquery instruction has been executed? Such as $("selector").jqueryAction(...).X(function(){  }); where X is ??
[05:11:47] <Raverix> The other way, is to just multiply your delay by count.
[05:11:55] <ckoekemoer> Raverix thank you for letting me know, once again very sorry
[05:11:57] <Raverix> .delay(count*1000);
[05:12:15] <rogeruiz> kollapse: You can use the callback function
[05:12:24] <Raverix> That'd give you a 1 second delay between starts of animates (but you should put the delay BEFORE the animate call)
[05:13:03] <rogeruiz> kollapse: The code won't execute until after the jQuery code completes
[05:13:50] <nail_> oh I didn't see the delay
[05:14:03] <kollapse> rogeruiz: Hmm. I don't think for example .buttonset() has a callback feature.
[05:14:09] <rogeruiz> $("selector").jqueryAction(..., function(){//after jQuery action})
[05:14:10] <rogeruiz> Hmm
[05:14:36] <kollapse> Maybe .buttonset({}, function(){ ... }) ?
[05:15:01] <nail_> ckoekemoer: with delay you'll need to add queue: true to animate's params
[05:15:03] <Innocentus> QUESTION: If I want to select all dom elements with the class "test" in a dom element with the id "container", would the following JQuery-selector work?: $('#container.test). ...?
[05:15:06] <Lorde> I think I've found a bug in jQuery's XML parser, but correct me if I'm wrong. I fetch an XML document, found here: http://pastebin.com/GAKN1XFG, from my server and want to display it. This HTML/JS page shows what I want to do:http://pastebin.com/BGkRzjgx (you can download and run it, just include jquery.js in the same directory). The problem is that the error messages show up in both containers, which they shouldn't. If you run this in a debugger it seems qui
[05:15:09] <Raverix> ckoekemoer: Your selector is very odd... might I ask what you're attempting to do with it?
[05:15:21] <Innocentus> $('#container.test')
[05:15:23] <rogeruiz> I would try that kollapse
[05:15:53] <ckoekemoer> raverix i have 4 h3 tags in a div and i want to flash the opacity for each on one by one
[05:16:00] <kollapse> rogeruiz: Unfortunately no luck - does nothing (inserted an allert in the callback).
[05:16:07] <Innocentus> anyone? :(
[05:16:30] <Raverix> ckoekemoer: You should select once, and iterate through them, take a look at jquery's .each()
[05:16:51] <rogeruiz> kollapse: You're using buttonset()?
[05:17:00] <ckoekemoer> ok will look thank you
[05:17:37] <[1]bob> Raverix I think it's the way I retrieve the Json data, how do you normally send back json data ?
[05:18:02] <kollapse> rogeruiz: Yes, from UI.
[05:18:14] <rogeruiz>  kollapse I don't think there is a buttonset method in jQ.  Is that your own function?
[05:18:37] <rogeruiz> Ah I see. Im not that familiar with the UI but let me see
[05:18:54] <kollapse> rogeruiz: http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#option-label choose Radios from right.
[05:19:04] <kollapse> rogeruiz: And from source - $( "#radio" ).buttonset();
[05:19:11] <Lorde> Also, my code works just fine if i change <action-message-list/> to <action-message-list></action-message-list> ...
[05:19:44] <Raverix> ckoekemoer: http://jsfiddle.net/26d4K/
[05:20:15] <kollapse> rogeruiz: I remember jquery having something like $("selector").action(...).finished(function(){ ... }); for executing a function when a jquery command has finished doing what it had to do. Wishful thinking ?
[05:20:16] <Raverix> Much cleaner more concise way to do this.
[05:21:02] <Innocentus> Raverix, kollapse, rogeruiz, [1]bob, choekemoer:  QUESTION: If I want to select all dom elements with the class "test" in a dom element with the id "container", would the following JQuery-selector work?: $('#container.test). ...?
[05:21:13] <Raverix> No.
[05:21:17] <Raverix> Learn CSS.
[05:21:23] <rogeruiz> kollapse: I haven't heard of that. Could me.
[05:21:54] <Raverix> #contaner.test would select the element with the ID: container, and the Class:test
[05:21:54] <rogeruiz> Be*
[05:22:17] <Raverix> Need a space between: #container .test
[05:22:24] <rogeruiz> kollapse: So you want a way to track a successful change to a buttonset?
[05:22:34] <Raverix> This will select all elements with the class 'test' which is a descendant of the element with the id container.
[05:22:44] <kollapse> rogeruiz: No, actually I want to execute some code after a buttonset has been created.
[05:23:01] <kollapse> rogeruiz: So I don't have the risk of executing something on objects that don't exist
[05:23:11] <Lorde> Also, my code works just fine if i change <action-message-list/> to <action-message-list></action-message-list> ...
[05:23:27] <Raverix> kollapse: I'm very confused about your issue.
[05:23:29] <Lorde> oops, sorry. <up>-<enter>-ed in the wrong terminal.
[05:23:31] <rogeruiz> kollapse: Use try and catch
[05:23:37] <Raverix> 1) createbuttonset();
[05:23:45] <Raverix> 2) dosomethingafterbuttonscreated();
[05:23:47] <Raverix> Done.
[05:24:11] <rogeruiz> That seems right
[05:24:14] <Raverix> What's going on asynchronously that's messing you up?
[05:24:32] <kollapse> Raverix: Won't there be a risk of number 2) executing before number 1) finishes ?
[05:24:36] <kollapse> And such finding something incomplete ?
[05:24:37] <Raverix> No.
[05:24:52] <ckoekemoer> Raverix. Dude you rock!!! :D
[05:24:52] <Raverix> Welcome to the world of synchronous linear programing.
[05:25:10] <kollapse> Raverix: That's a little reassuring.
[05:25:16] <kollapse> Thanks for the help rogeruiz, Raverix.
[05:25:31] <Raverix> Unless you're specifically doing something Asynchronously (ajax, etc) you can ALWAYS be guaranteed that the previous statement finished before the next one.
[05:25:53] <Raverix> Programming would fall apart if that wasn't the case.
[05:26:00] <kollapse> Raverix: And when using Ajax I can simply use the Ajax callback function, right ?
[05:26:05] <Raverix> Correct.
[05:26:08] <kollapse> Understood.
[05:26:11] <rogeruiz> Innocentus: Jquery accepts CSS selectors. #id .class will search for the class inside of the id
[05:27:33] <Raverix> ckoekemoer: I just do this for a living.
[05:28:17] <Innocentus> rogeruiz: so it is right?
[05:28:36] <Raverix> Innocentus: No, it is not.... there's a SPACE between the #container and the .test
[05:28:48] <Raverix> That space denotes 'descendant' which is very important.
[05:29:06] <Raverix> You really need to put jquery on hold for 10 minutes, and read a CSS primer.
[05:29:27] <Raverix> You need to have a good understanding of at least CSS1 selectors.
[05:29:49] <rogeruiz> Innocentus: You need a space between the two. Or you could just do this. $(".test", "#container")
[05:30:01] <rogeruiz> That will search for .test inside of container
[05:30:02] <Raverix> Innocentus: http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/selector.html#pattern-matching
[05:30:45] <rogeruiz> Innocentus: I recommend learning CSS
[05:30:48] <rogeruiz> Or brushing up on it of you have learned it
[05:31:12] <Innocentus> ok
[05:31:14] <Innocentus> thank you
[05:33:40] <BlaDe^> how can I detect a click not within a div? I have a popup container positioned absolutely with z-index:9999
[05:34:11] <BlaDe^> I want it to close when you click anywhere else on the page, I did that with  $("body").live("click", function(e) { if ($("#folderSelector2:visible").length) {  $("#folderSelector2").hide(); } }); ---- however, it closes when you click an element in the popup too
[05:35:02] <rogeruiz> BlaDe^: For overlays I wrap it in a overlay div and track the event on that element
[05:35:06] <keirlav> why not create a catching element behind the overlay when the overlay is created? then catch the clicks inside that
[05:35:15] <rogeruiz> Your overlay seems to be out in the open
[05:35:24] <blackspotwiggins> or check if the click target is decendant of the popup
[05:35:51] <blackspotwiggins> ?contains@ BlaDe^
[05:35:52] <bot-t> BlaDe^, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[05:36:01] <blackspotwiggins> meh
[05:36:02] <keirlav> basically a div that is full screen width and height with a z-index of less than overlay div, then place the click event on that div
[05:36:03] <blackspotwiggins> ?$.contains
[05:36:04] <bot-t> blackspotwiggins, :contains() Selector - Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[05:36:41] <blackspotwiggins> i meant this http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[05:36:44] <BlaDe^> keirlav yeah a wrapper would work
[05:36:46] <BlaDe^>  i'll try contains
[05:36:51] <BlaDe^> (first)
[05:37:00] <blackspotwiggins> it uses straight up dom elements tho
[05:37:17] <BlaDe^> so it wouldn't work with the popup i assume
[05:37:23] <blackspotwiggins> why
[05:37:29] <BlaDe^> because the dom is changed to show it
[05:37:38] <blackspotwiggins> just use document.getElementById("popup") and event.target
[05:37:48] <blackspotwiggins> or $("#popup")[0]
[05:38:48] <BlaDe^> blackspotwiggins: if ($("#folderSelector2:visible").length && !$.contains($("#folderSelector2")[0], e.target)) {
[05:38:50] <BlaDe^> like t hat ?
[05:39:50] <keirlav> how compatible is border-image can anyone tell me?
[05:40:05] <BlaDe^> great -- for soem reason I can't negate it with a "!" for false, but == false works great
[05:40:07] <BlaDe^> thankyou blackspotwiggins
[05:40:31] <AzaToth> old question: how can I identify if an object is a jqueryui object?
[05:40:41] <AzaToth> I always forgot
[05:42:04] <lkeijser> Raverix: sorry for not responding, i was trying to get it to work ... which failed
[05:42:30] <lkeijser> Raverix: i'm trying to apply the jquery again after i regenerate the list: http://dpaste.com/566401/
[05:42:40] <lkeijser> (don't mind the django code in between)
[05:42:53] <Raverix> You do not apply jQuery.
[05:42:58] <Raverix> You 'run' or 'execute' it.
[05:43:10] <lkeijser> sorry, yeah you're right
[05:43:17] <dr0id> or use vapor.js
[05:43:35] <Raverix> Move lines 23 therough 28 to immediately AFTER line 20.
[05:43:51] <Raverix> This is the callback for your JSON.
[05:44:13] <Raverix> You want to immediately run your code after you've modified the the DOM (the HTML on the page).
[05:44:45] <lkeijser> okay
[05:45:16] <lkeijser> great, that worked, thanks a lot
[05:46:18] <Raverix> Do you understand WHY it worked/
[05:46:30] <lkeijser> wait, let me check
[05:48:05] <lkeijser> not really. I don't understand why i can't wait with running the code while still being in the main get_orderlist() function
[05:48:46] <Raverix> Do you know what AJAX stands for? Do you know what asynchronous means?
[05:49:07] <Germanaz0> hello everybody
[05:49:07] <lkeijser> Raverix: i guess not
[05:49:16] <Germanaz0> I'm getting troubles with jquery datepicker
[05:49:38] <Germanaz0> someone is familiar with the plugin?
[05:50:12] <Raverix> lkeijser: AJAX means that it's a asynchronous request... that means that your code STARTS to execute now... but doesn't complete until a later date... the result is that your code to run qtip happens BEFORE you've made changes to the HTML.
[05:50:33] <Raverix> By putting the code inside the callback, you can be sure that your code has finished executing.
[05:50:37] <Raverix> And the people rejoice.
[05:51:50] <lkeijser> Raverix: i have to admit, it will probably take me some time to fully understand this, but your explanation is logical
[05:52:23] <Aple> Can anyone tell me why this doesn't work? http://pastie.org/2196509
[05:52:41] <Raverix> Well, if you want a simple demonstration.... do this: console.log('1') at the top of your function, console.log('2') in the callback, and console.log('3') at the bottom.
[05:52:44] <Aple> By "doesn't work" I mean it doesn't slide down. It just appears.
[05:53:06] <Raverix> You will get 1, 3 instantly, and then 2 will get back after you've made the request to your server and come back 200-300 ms
[05:54:07] <Raverix> Aple: I believe that's because slideDown animates from current height, to full height.
[05:54:25] <Raverix> Which, if the current height, is the full height, then it doesn't really work for you.
[05:54:47] <Aple> Ah, I see
[05:54:52] <Raverix> Try this.... $('#create_listing table').slideUp().slideDown(); (it'll go from full height, to 0, and back)
[05:55:52] <Aple> Sorry, didn't work :(
[05:56:08] <Raverix> Ah, then we may have multiple problems here... is this site available online?
[05:57:30] <Raverix> Aple: Actually, slideDown should work... http://jsfiddle.net/26d4K/2/
[05:57:46] <keirlav> have you tried a delay before slidedown?
[05:58:21] <Aple> 1 sec
[05:59:26] <Aple> I'm also trying this code in an included php file. Dunno if that makes a difference.
[06:00:18] <Aple> http://pressedweb.com/example/slidedown/
[06:01:46] <Aple> Here's the code: http://pastie.org/2196535
[06:02:06] <Germanaz0> someone knows why the datepicker have bugs, when I use the tab key ?
[06:02:28] <Germanaz0> for example, I select the form field with tab and then submit the form
[06:02:35] <Germanaz0> it returns 1970 as date :S
[06:03:03] <lkeijser> Raverix: thanks for that tip on console.log , it makes more sense now
[06:04:01] <lkeijser> and i found out that firebug really helps to analyze these issues
[06:04:13] <Raverix> Yes.
[06:04:57] <Raverix> Germanaz0: a timestamp with a value of 0, is interpreted as Jan 1st, 1970
[06:05:08] <Raverix> That could be part of your issue.
[06:05:43] <Germanaz0> yes but weird
[06:06:21] <Germanaz0> the datepicker returns a value as 1310389.488 instead 1310389488
[06:07:46] <BlaDe^> has anyone uesd jquery colorbox?
[06:07:59] <kreantos> hey there
[06:08:16] <kreantos> can one of you help me with jquery datepicker?
[06:10:03] <kreantos> i have the problem that beforeShowDay is called not only for the borders of one month but for the full calendar view (so if i have july, it is called also for some days of august)
[06:11:21] <Raverix> Aple: Don't animate a table directory.
[06:11:25] <Raverix> Give it a wrapper.
[06:11:56] <Raverix> HTML Tables are the red-headed stepchild of the web world....
[06:12:26] <t4nkd> Unless of corse, you have some tabular data(which is the red-headed stepchild of data sets)
[06:13:01] <Raverix> t4nkd: Indeed... but tell me this... how come I can't even properly CSS style tables used for tabular data? WTF?
[06:13:32] <t4nkd> lol; that's a question for the W3C
[06:13:42] <Raverix> Nah, it's the browsers :p
[06:13:54] <Aple> Oh are they?
[06:14:05] <Raverix> Aple: Yeah, there's a lot of issues with tables.
[06:14:10] <Aple> k
[06:14:14] <Raverix> Typically, you can get around it with a <div> to wrap the table.
[06:14:35] <Raverix> Or, if you're trying to hide a <td>, you use <td><div></div></td> and hide the contents of the TD, instead of the TD.
[06:14:40] <Raverix> Stupid workarounds like that.
[06:15:25] <Aple> Raverix: That's the ticket!
[06:15:30] <Aple> Tables suck. :)
[06:15:30] <t4nkd> &nbsp; :P
[06:19:18] <toxz> can i generate a unique key via jquery for every dom element?
[06:19:40] <Raverix> Yes, but if you need to, you're doing something wrong.
[06:20:27] <toxz> Raverix - i want to save values via data() - and if my function gets a different dom element i want to update the data()
[06:20:31] <kreantos> can someone help me with my datepicker problem?
[06:20:34] <toxz> i dont think that this is wrong
[06:20:36] <guy> $('#tab').bind('mousemove', function(e)
[06:20:37] <kreantos> i have the problem that beforeShowDay is called not only for the borders of one month but for the full calendar view (so if i have july, it is called also for some days of august)
[06:20:41] <guy> why this doesn't work?
[06:20:42] <_dave_h_d> Hi everyone, has anyone used GWT, and what do you think about it, is it the right tech to use for developing web apps? Please give me your opinions.
[06:21:22] <guy> nevermind.
[06:21:36] <Raverix> toxz: Actually, that does sound wrong
[06:21:36] <Aple> Raverix++
[06:21:53] <Raverix> toxz: What type of data are you trying to save?
[06:22:06] <toxz> Raverix - json
[06:22:29] <guy> so, how do I bind event mousemove within #target_element_zone?
[06:22:33] <Raverix> And why are you associated it with a HTML element?
[06:22:45] <guy> checking parent() would be hell expensive on resources.
[06:22:47] <toxz> Raverix - i want to save a dom-element-id additionally, so i can see if another dom element is addressed now
[06:23:11] <DroMastaP> Hi everybody
[06:23:27] <Raverix> Hellol
[06:23:31] <toxz> Raverix - i w
[06:24:01] <toxz> Raverix - i try to put it in an generic plugin - thats why i need that (i think)
[06:24:09] <DroMastaP> A question : i'm working on a website who call pages through $get function
[06:24:20] <Raverix> toxz: I stand by my original assessment... if you need to do that, you most likely have something wrong with the architecture of your plugin.
[06:24:42] <DroMastaP> and now, one of my pages contains a form
[06:24:48] <DroMastaP> php form
[06:24:53] <Raverix> toxz: Why aren't you simply storing this json data as a variable within an object associated with the DOM element?
[06:25:00] <DroMastaP> what function have I to use ?
[06:25:18] <DroMastaP> I want my form result into a div in the same called page
[06:25:52] <toxz> Raverix - because i eventually want to share it for other elements too. but i will think about it
[06:29:22] <toxz> Raverix - "storing this json data as a variable within an object associated with the DOM element" - you mean with $.data() or $('element').blahblah = ...  ?
[06:30:19] <Raverix> Depends on what you're doing.
[06:31:06] <Raverix> I can't make architectural suggestions without knowing more, except that 99.9% of the time, you don't need to assign a unique ID to every element of the page.
[06:31:41] <mazzachre> Which is faster (and does it matter) $('table tbody').children().removeClass('even'); $('table tbody tr:even').addClass('even'); or $('table tbody tr:even').addClass('even'); $('table tbody tr:odd').removeClass('even');
[06:32:40] <caz_> Hi there
[06:33:46] <DroMastaP> Here my code to call html pages >>> http://pastebin.com/STNZvWzz , so I have a div named #afficheur ( french ) and it work good. But when I try to make a php post form, impossible to stay into my #afficheur, when I post, it's on a new page. I want to put the results into a #results div, but how to do that with jquery ?
[06:34:27] <caz_> Try with load() function
[06:34:41] <Raverix> mazzachre: Time it and found out. My hunch is that the fastest way would be the latter on any modern web browser.
[06:34:41] <Anitox> If I want to add some text into a textarea, can I use .append, or do I need to use .text?
[06:34:50] <DroMastaP> @caz_ me ?
[06:35:04] <caz_> DroMastaP: sure :)
[06:35:08] <DroMastaP> :)
[06:35:12] <DroMastaP> i'm gonna see
[06:35:18] <mazzachre> Also... I have an interesting problem... I have (in this same table) a button on each row that I want to trigger an event on the table with a unique (for the row) ID. Right now I delegate click to the button and inside the handler function I do $(this).closest('table').trigger('something', $(this).closest('tr').attr('id').substring(5)); this seems a little strange.. but is it the "right way" (tm)?
[06:35:42] <DroMastaP> I have seen a function $post, is it different ?
[06:36:01] <mazzachre> DroMastaP: $get uses get request, $post uses post...
[06:36:11] <caz_> I think you'll have to use both $post and .load() methods
[06:36:14] <mazzachre> DroMastaP: Otherwise they are exactly the same...
[06:36:15] <ThiefMaster|work> there is no $get/$post, only $.get and $.post
[06:36:33] <mazzachre> Generally, for full control, use $.ajax
[06:36:36] <ThiefMaster|work> besides that, i'd rather use $.ajax as having just as single argument as a dict makes the code look nicer
[06:36:40] <DroMastaP> nice mazzachre !
[06:36:54] <DroMastaP> i'm gonna try, i'm new in jquery :/
[06:37:06] <DroMastaP> thank you very much for ur time ;)
[06:37:20] <mazzachre> After all these years (But doing mainly backend most of the time) I still feel like a beginner...
[06:37:44] <dimonweb> Hi! advise the gallery with the mouse wheel (to switch images), please
[06:38:20] <Anticom> hi all
[06:38:39] <DroMastaP> hi
[06:38:42] <caz_> I also got a problem with my javascript scripts: I'm loading content with .load() function but then I want to execute a function into the loaded page. How can I achieve it? I tried putting my code in the document.ready() part, but it does not work
[06:39:07] <Anticom> i want to navigate to insert a dom element (<tr>) inside a table at the end of tr's having a specific class
[06:39:10] <Anticom> how can i do that? http://jsfiddle.net/BcvvT/
[06:40:47] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/BcvvT/2/
[06:41:51] <mazzachre> Anticom: My idea would something like ('.myClass:last').append();
[06:42:33] <dimonweb> advise the gallery with the mouse wheel (to switch images), please
[06:42:54] <Anticom> mazzachre: but the prob is, that the tr's got the classes and when i append a tr to a tr that doesn't make sense (<table><tr><tr><td>inserted</td></tr><td>been there before</td></tr></table>)
[06:44:57] <mazzachre> Anticom: sorry... .after() is probably the function you look for :)
[06:45:19] <mazzachre> Anticom: $('.myclass:last').after(myHtml);
[06:45:25] <Anticom> it should be done somehow with .insertAfter('tr.content:last'), but dunno how to manage that with the navigation
[06:45:32] <Anticom> mazzachre: ah okay thanks
[06:46:57] <dimonweb> Please asvice the gallery on JQuery (change images using mouse wheel)/ Thanks
[06:47:02] <kreantos> so there is no experienced jquery datepicker user?
[06:47:15] <beevi7> i used it once
[06:47:19] <beevi7> but that was in 2009 or so
[06:47:45] <kreantos> have you used the beforeShowDay callback ?
[06:47:58] <aaronmcadam> what are u tryin to do
[06:48:13] <kreantos> i wrote a jquery plugin
[06:48:31] <aaronmcadam> well done, you'll be famous soon then
[06:48:36] <caz_> I also got a problem with my javascript scripts: I'm loading content with .load() function but then I want to execute a function into the loaded page. How can I achieve it? I tried putting my code in the document.ready() part, but it does not work
[06:49:00] <kreantos> which automatically deactivates days which have been already selected
[06:49:00] <aaronmcadam> ?delegate @ caz_
[06:49:01] <bot-t> caz_, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[06:49:24] <caz_> 'll look at it, thank you aaronmcadam
[06:49:40] <kreantos> but unfortunately the beforeShowDay callback is not just called for every day of the displayed month
[06:50:00] <kreantos> but also for some days before and after the month
[06:50:19] <kreantos> and this is causing problems in my plugin
[06:52:27] <kreantos> @aaronmcadam is there a way to prevent datepicker to call beforeshowday for other days then the actual shown month?
[06:52:58] <AdvoWork> how can i turn var optionText = $("#filter2 > option:selected").text(); into NOT selected?
[06:53:37] <aaronmcadam> kreantos in the callback, i spose you could check the clicked month
[06:53:45] <aaronmcadam> shown month i mean
[06:54:11] <aaronmcadam> and just don't fire what u want inside beforeShowDay
[06:54:27] <aaronmcadam> unless the month is what you want maybe
[06:55:02] <kreantos> @aaronmcadam thanks, any clue where i can get the shown month?
[06:55:11] <aaronmcadam> kreantos, go on #jqueryui and #jqueryui-dev
[06:55:23] <aaronmcadam> well there is a callback for that too I'd say
[06:55:34] <kreantos> ok thank you!
[06:55:34] <aaronmcadam> or else there might be a class applied to the widget
[06:57:34] <Raverix> AdvoWork: Select something else.
[06:57:56] <AdvoWork> Raverix, i want all options that aren't selected
[06:58:16] <Raverix> Oh... I misunderstood what you were requested.
[06:58:58] <Raverix> http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[06:59:14] <Raverix> http://api.jquery.com/not/
[06:59:41] <Raverix> So, $('#filter2 option').not(':selected').text();
[07:00:16] <Raverix> Or #filter option:not(:selected)
[07:01:06] <AdvoWork> ahh ojk, thanks
[07:02:45] <lathan> ?HI
[07:02:46] <bot-t> lathan, :)
[07:03:29] <Aldus> Hi. From my index.html I load some content in a div using load(). I want the new loaded content to use all the functions, triggers, etc. defined in index.html. How to do it? (it was evalScripts or something similar)
[07:03:31] <lathan> Raverix, AdvoWork although, the less string parsing done the faster it will be, it will only be noticable on large repititions of that code
[07:03:48] <lathan> Aldus, that shuold work fine
[07:04:01] <lathan> Aldus, if you load a javascript tag into a page, that pages functions should be there
[07:04:32] <lathan> and the event handlers / triggers are going to work from that page's eventspace
[07:04:33] <Raverix> lathan: Actually, on modern browsers, the selector is faster.
[07:04:39] <Aldus> lathan, I have something like $(".test").click(function [...]  it works only for a <div class="test"[...] that is in the main page, and not for items with class "test" of the loaded page
[07:04:40] <lathan> Raverix, really?
[07:04:45] <Raverix> lathan: Yes.
[07:04:56] <lathan> ?delegate @ Aldus
[07:04:56] <bot-t> Aldus, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:05:18] <Aldus> it's like the $(".test").click() is not run on the newly loaded items, but only on document.ready()
[07:05:23] <lathan> Aldus, regular click events only work on what is in the HTML at that moment, if you want new content to be included use live or delegate
[07:05:32] <Aldus> lathan, that's what I need. Thanks
[07:05:32] <lathan> *any events
[07:05:38] <lathan> ?np @ Aldus
[07:05:38] <bot-t> Aldus, No Problem
[07:05:58] <Aldus> lathan, where should delegate be run?
[07:06:06] <caz_> Hey Aldus, if you get it work, please could you help me a bit?
[07:06:09] <lathan> Raverix, I have a hard time wrapping my mind around how less string parsing can take more time?
[07:06:18] <lathan> Aldus, I'm not quite sure what you mean
[07:06:21] <caz_> Aldus: I've got the same issue
[07:06:34] <lathan> Aldus, look at that link to the docs (http://docs.jquery.com/delegate/)
[07:06:45] <kryl> hi
[07:06:45] <lathan> (or what Bot-t said)
[07:06:48] <lathan> ?hi @ kreantos
[07:06:48] <bot-t> kreantos, :)
[07:06:51] <lathan> sry kreantos
[07:06:54] <lathan> ?hi @ kryl
[07:06:54] <bot-t> kryl, :)
[07:07:20] <lathan> Aldus, $('#context').delegate('.new-div','click',function(){ ... })
[07:07:37] <Raverix> lathan: document.querySelectorAll is typically the fastest operation possible.
[07:07:50] <lathan> Aldus, just needs to run after the '#context' is loaded
[07:07:57] <kryl> $('.web0 .web1').attr("disabled", true);  how to lock these two input by class ?
[07:08:02] <lathan> ?mdc querySelectorAll @ lathan
[07:08:03] <bot-t> lathan, document.querySelectorAll - MDN Docs - Returns a list of the elements within the document (using depth-first pre-order traversal of the document's nodes) that match the specified group of selectors. The object returned is a NodeList . https://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM/Document.querySelectorAll
[07:08:08] <lathan> ?comma selector @ kryl
[07:08:11] <bot-t> kryl, #4999 (Selectors with commas do not work in jQuery 1.3 and IE 7 ... - Opened 2 years ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/4999
[07:08:19] <lathan> kryl, $('.web0, .web1')
[07:08:21] <lathan> commas
[07:08:29] <kryl> ok ! thank you lathan
[07:08:55] <lathan> Raverix, are you telling me that sizzle is only used for IE7 - ?
[07:09:25] <Aldus> lathan, it works. THANKS
[07:09:52] <lathan> ?np @ Aldus
[07:09:52] <bot-t> Aldus, No Problem
[07:10:14] <aaronmcadam> ?np @ bot-t
[07:10:15] <bot-t> bot-t, No Problem
[07:10:15] <Raverix> lathan: Yes.
[07:10:25] <Raverix> http://bigbinary.com/2010/02/15/how-jquery-selects-elements-using-sizzle.html
[07:10:38] <Raverix> "It means that if you are using IE8 or current version of any other modern browser then jQuery code jQuery(‘#header a’) will not even hit Sizzle."
[07:13:12] <caz_> lathan: I'm stuck on the same problem as Aldus was, here is my Fiddle
[07:13:16] <caz_> lathan: http://jsfiddle.net/FfwK5/
[07:13:29] <caz_> Could you help getting my point wrong
[07:13:32] <kuroir> hey guys
[07:13:38] <kuroir> check this way to write plugins on the fly
[07:13:38] <jeffsmykil> can you append a javascript file to the head on document ready and have it work?
[07:13:39] <kuroir> https://github.com/kuroir/jQuery-Condom
[07:13:42] <kuroir> feedback is appreciated.
[07:14:06] <kuroir> jQuery Condom allows you to override jQuery functions if you want, without affecting the global namespace.
[07:14:13] <jeffsmykil> Im trying this  $('head').append(VisualScript); //puts the new script in the header
[07:14:15] <jeffsmykil> but its not working
[07:16:08] <symfonyMan> hello
[07:16:20] <kuroir> so you can do stuff like $.ns('myjq').add('pop', function(this) { $(this).hide() });  and then $('div').ns('myjq').pop()
[07:16:34] <symfonyMan> how can i do an infinit scroll with jquery
[07:16:48] <symfonyMan> like the message scrolling in facebook
[07:17:05] <caz_> Aldus: Hey, Are you there?
[07:17:43] <Dangr_> symfonyMan, http://www.infinite-scroll.com/
[07:19:01] <Raverix> symfonyMan: Programming.
[07:19:11] <lathan> caz_, what isn't working?
[07:19:19] <Dangr_> symfonyMan, you can also try Masonry - http://masonry.desandro.com/demos/infinite-scroll.html
[07:19:40] <phryk> Hello there. I'm having somewhat of a problem with IE.
[07:19:51] <lathan> phryk, join the club
[07:19:52] <Dangr_> phryk, who doesnt lol
[07:20:15] <phryk> It complained about a variable, beltId, being undefined. So I did the following: http://pastebin.com/369GNN9L
[07:20:36] <symfonyMan> Dangr_ : is infinit scroll in facebook messages or something else ?
[07:20:45] <phryk> However, it still friggin complains about the variable being undefined… (i.e. doesn't evaluate the if condition as true)
[07:20:46] <lathan> phryk, try using window.beltId
[07:21:26] <Dangr_> Dangr_, not sure if Facebook uses it - they for all I know probably wrote something custom. Infinite scroll sounds like what you want though
[07:21:31] <phryk> the weird thing is that *sometimes* (for example when i reload with ctrl+f5) it works…
[07:21:31] <Yooast> I'm having a really strange bug here
[07:21:36] <Sora_> hiya ppl
[07:21:42] <Yooast> Internet Explorer seems unable to execute my jQuery plugin
[07:21:44] <Yooast> like.. at all
[07:21:45] <[1]bob> What's the difference between $.ready and $(document).ready ?
[07:21:48] <symfonyMan> ok thanks
[07:21:57] <caz_> lathan: my delegate method does not work
[07:22:12] <Yooast> it throws "this property or method is not supported by the object" when calling my custom plugin function thingy
[07:22:28] <Swimming_bird> is there a method like .add(...) which modifies the object? inestead of returning a new object
[07:22:29] <Raverix> [1]bob: Read the documentation.
[07:22:48] <Dangr_> symfonyMan, you might try this too: http://www.webresourcesdepot.com/load-content-while-scrolling-with-jquery/ the demo seems to do what youw ant
[07:23:08] <symfonyMan> thanks Dangr_
[07:23:10] <symfonyMan> ;)
[07:23:16] <Dangr_> :-D
[07:24:13] <Yooast> can anyone take a look at the JS here, in IE?
[07:24:14] <Yooast> http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3018741/LenP/kantoren.htm
[07:24:30] <phryk> lathan: doesn't make any difference
[07:24:31] <inferno> hey , i cant click the subnavigation in  my dropdown , i dont have much clue of the jquery :( , cud any one help with  that  ^_^
[07:24:46] <phryk> lathan: oh wait it does
[07:24:47] <lathan> caz_ simplify your example
[07:24:57] <caz_> Hum right
[07:24:57] <phryk> now it's complaining about a different variable and doesn't work
[07:25:03] <caz_> lathan: I'll try
[07:25:05] <phryk> IE sucks so friggin hard -_-
[07:25:09] <lathan> phryk, window is an object of all your variables
[07:25:23] <Yooast> Sure does, phryk  :/
[07:25:24] * lathan nods @ phryk
[07:25:27] <Yooast> no debugging :(
[07:25:49] <Raverix> phryk: You have JS errors on the page in IE
[07:25:57] <Raverix> phryk: I suggest you address those first.
[07:26:44] <Sora_> element.style['position'] = 'absolute'  miss ;
[07:26:55] <nddery> can I pass GET info with .load() ? (ie. .load('page.php?date=20110711) ?
[07:27:16] <phryk> Raverix: ? Isn't that what I'm doing right now?
[07:27:20] <Sora_> var heightdif = h
[07:27:20] <Sora_> 			h = 0;
[07:27:24] <Sora_> miss ;
[07:27:33] <Raverix> phryk: No, you're just saying 'something is broke'
[07:27:37] <Sora_> phryk:
[07:27:44] <caz_> lathan: the problem is that I can't load external data in JSFiddle, no?
[07:27:55] <inferno> i cant click the subnavigation in my dropdown , i dont have much clue of the jquery :( , cud any one help with that ^_^
[07:28:01] <phryk> Raverix: Read what I wrote first, please.
[07:28:03] <Sora_> phryk: u have miss ;
[07:28:11] <phryk> Sora_: I have what?
[07:28:22] <Sora_> in u js
[07:28:25] <Sora_> var heightdif = h
[07:28:25] <Sora_> 			h = 0;
[07:28:26] <lathan> caz_, correct
[07:28:27] <Sora_> ;
[07:28:31] <Aldus> caz_, the delegate() function works as lathan exlpained
[07:28:45] <lathan> caz_, but you can still do a delegate and then create new content inside to test
[07:28:50] <lathan> (just not load it from ajax)
[07:29:02] <phryk> Sora_: I don't have any clue what you're trying to say o_O
[07:29:04] <Raverix> phryk: I said wrong name, sorry.
[07:29:11] <Sora_> u have missing semicolon's
[07:29:13] <Sora_> u.u
[07:29:13] <lathan> ?demo @ inferno
[07:29:13] <bot-t> inferno, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:29:14] <caz_> I'll try
[07:29:17] <phryk> Sora_: Ah.
[07:29:36] <Raverix> Yooast: You have a JS error in IE, fix that first.
[07:29:36] <JAAulde> G'Morning jQuerians. We're hvaing an issue with Malsup's form plugin and IE7 when the combo is used in conjunction with jQ Core 1.6.* - Seems he is using .attr() for the disabled property and it is causing IE7 to drop form fields
[07:29:46] <Yooast> Raverix that's what I'm here for
[07:29:49] <JAAulde> Anyone seen anything like this or know of a fix coming out?
[07:29:51] <Yooast> I cant seem to figure out what the error means
[07:29:52] <phryk> Sora_: Where o_O Are you sure you're not writing to the wrong person, too?
[07:29:54] <Yooast> or what is causing it
[07:30:05] <Yooast> I was hoping someone could give me a pointer :(
[07:30:18] <Sora_> lol
[07:30:36] <Sora_> sry u.u
[07:30:39] <Raverix> 'Object doesn't support this property or method'
[07:30:45] <Yooast> Exactly
[07:30:48] <Raverix> Line 12, character 7.
[07:30:52] <Yooast> That's just me calling my plugins function :/
[07:30:56] <Yooast> Yeah that's exactly as far as I'm getting
[07:31:01] <Raverix> $(document).setupPageScroller();
[07:31:06] <Raverix> $(document) is the object.
[07:31:13] <Raverix> which doesn't support setupPageScroller()
[07:31:22] <lathan> Yooast, then your plugin isn't properly initialized
[07:31:22] <Raverix> IE: setupPageScroller() doesn't exist.
[07:31:27] <kborchers> Yooast: your problem is the const keyword you're trying to use. just use var
[07:31:28] <Yooast> Yeah
[07:31:29] <Sora_> is for Yooast
[07:31:38] <Yooast> (function($) {
[07:31:39] <Yooast>     $.fn.setupPageScroller = function() {
[07:31:40] <Yooast> is that wrong?
[07:31:48] <caz_> lathan, Aldus, my Fiddle is updated, could you please get a quick look?
[07:31:51] <Yooast> ah, it's not approving const?
[07:31:52] <lathan> Yooast, doesn't look like it....
[07:32:50] <lathan> caz_, the underlining bar underneath turns red, and the image appears and slides back up
[07:32:54] <lathan> caz_, what is the issue?
[07:33:01] <caz_> Hum
[07:33:15] <caz_> It slides back, i'll deactivates it
[07:33:25] <Yooast> Changing the const to a var fixed it >_<
[07:34:08] <Aldus> lathan, however the delegate() function works well,  but what if I wanted to re-eval ALL the scripts in $.ready()..?
[07:34:17] <danielss89> Hi..
[07:34:19] <lathan> re-eval?
[07:34:19] <caz_> lathan: maybe the fiddle ID is not good anymore : http://jsfiddle.net/FfwK5/9/
[07:34:26] <Aldus> lathan, to re-run all the functions
[07:34:30] <lathan> Aldus, why would you want to re-eval all?
[07:34:31] <danielss89> if i run this when a button is clicked: $(".time.free.appointmentReady").mouseover(function(){ <-- how can i remove it again?
[07:34:45] <lathan> ?unbind @ danielss89
[07:34:45] <bot-t> danielss89, .unbind(eventType, handler): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[07:34:51] <lathan> .unbind('mouseover')
[07:35:00] <danielss89> cool thx
[07:35:04] <Aldus> lathan, to avoid using delegate() on all of them
[07:35:13] <Aldus> i've got dozens of click events, etc.
[07:36:03] <lathan> Aldus, you should want to use delegate (or live) on all of them
[07:36:50] <danielss89> lathan: $(".time.free.appointmentReady").unbind('mouseover'); doesnt seem to work :S
[07:37:03] <ElGoorf> i want to .load() some html, but also take a json object in the process, but as far as im aware, js/jquery wouldnt be able to parse the string in the header and create the object from it..?
[07:37:49] <danielss89> never mind
[07:37:54] <Aldus> lathan, ok :)
[07:37:56] <kollapse> Gee... buttonset sure is slow... more than a 100 buttons in the set and activating any one of them has a delay of about 1-2 seconds...
[07:38:29] <lathan> ElGoorf, if you want to do a specialized function you have to handle it yourself using $.get or $.ajax
[07:38:43] <lathan> kollapse, are you using delegate?
[07:38:59] <Yooast> When debugging in IE, I use IECollection by Utilu, but something's wrong: it's always starting IE6, even when I tell it to start 7 or 8 :/
[07:40:17] <lathan> Yooast, idk
[07:41:45] <Jaac> I have content in a div, which by a click function gets replaced with new content retrieved over AJAX, in particular the function .load()
[07:41:50] <Jaac> Now im trying to add a slide effect to the divs, as in, slide the original div from right to the left while the new content slides in with it.
[07:41:56] <Jaac> How would i go by creating this? My current code, seems to wait on the first command, which leaves a white empty space while sliding out the original content!?
[07:42:01] <kollapse> lathan: No, I don't even know what delegate is.
[07:42:12] <JAAulde> Is anyone else running Malsup's form plugin with jQuery 1.6.x ?
[07:42:54] <lathan> kollapse, it allows you to bind one event to a parent object, instead of hundreds of events (which slow down the page)
[07:42:58] <lathan> ?delegate @ kollapse
[07:42:59] <bot-t> kollapse, .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): [New in v1.4.2] Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now or in the future, based upon a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[07:43:03] <lathan> read the docs ^^
[07:43:38] <ElGoorf> lathan, even so im not sure how to go about it
[07:44:24] <lathan> ElGoorf, sry, I'm looking at 3 different things here, what was your question?
[07:44:28] <ElGoorf> if i send the json_encode string via a response header, jquery wouldnt auto parse it as a json object would it
[07:44:32] <ElGoorf> dw i see ur busy ;)
[07:44:44] <lathan> response header?
[07:44:47] <lathan> or the response body
[07:44:53] <ElGoorf> i want to load some html into a div but also take some json data with it
[07:45:04] <lathan> caz_, I put alerts in the click handlers to know which is which: http://jsfiddle.net/lathan/FfwK5/11/
[07:45:42] <kborchers> ?animate @ Jaac
[07:45:42] <lathan> ElGoorf, they you have to do like $.get("...",function(data){ /* do something to split the JSON string from the HTMl string */ })
[07:45:42] <bot-t> Jaac, .animate(properties, [duration], [easing], [callback]): Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties. http://api.jquery.com/animate/
[07:45:52] <ElGoorf> i guessed as much
[07:45:53] <ElGoorf> ty
[07:45:59] <caz_> lathan: hum, i'll look at it. It will give me coding advices, i'm pretty sure
[07:46:00] <kollapse> lathan: I don't know how to use delegate since *I* am not the one that sets the events, I just call .buttonset() from UI that binds the 100 elements. I would reckon it already uses delegate, being official and all.
[07:46:05] <lathan> ElGoorf, like data.split("\n--my-unique-delimiter--\n")
[07:46:17] <lathan> ?buttonset
[07:46:19] <bot-t> lathan, UI/API/1.8/Button - Overview Options Events Methods Theming jQuery UI Button Overview Button enhances standard form elements like button, input of type submit or reset or anchors to themable buttons with appropiate mo... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Button
[07:46:21] <kborchers> Jaac: read about the queue option. if you chain the animations and set to queue: false, they will run simultaneously
[07:46:50] <Jaac> kborchers, ill have a look at it, Thanks!! mind if i PM you my site which the problem?
[07:46:57] <lathan> kollapse, isn't buttonset for radio button grouping?
[07:47:08] <kollapse> lathan: Yes, exactly - http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#option-label
[07:47:13] <kollapse> lathan: Choose radio from right.
[07:47:35] <lathan> kollapse, meaning you have like 100s of options in one of those?
[07:47:46] <lathan> kollapse, or hundreds of groups of radio groups
[07:47:51] <kborchers> Jaac: please, no pm's. just send the link. channel rules
[07:47:56] <kollapse> lathan: I have one buttonset with 100 radios in it.
[07:48:01] <m0dmd> good day 2 everyone.
[07:48:05] <lathan> ?hi @ m0dmd
[07:48:06] <bot-t> m0dmd, :)
[07:48:14] <m0dmd> hey hey hey :)
[07:49:45] <Jaac> Ok, too bad, thats why i thought to ask before PMing. Dont like to make the site public atm, ill try to figure it out :/
[07:50:14] <Yooast> Hmm this IEcollection thing is really  starting to bug me :(
[07:50:21] <Yooast> worked fine before my Parallels HD crashed
[07:51:05] <caz_> lathan: ok right, so you put all the code into the document.ready function. I tried that in my local page with my dynamic load, but that does not work. I really don't understand why...
[07:51:26] <Jaac> Yooast: Ive installed the latest on a vmware just today, all seems to work, no problems here.
[07:51:39] <guy> I've stuck with this mousemove issue: http://anuary.com/dev/hp/pad3/ [steps to reproduce the error]: click on any video; click anywhere on the video (this should trigger the unzoom mechanism) = mousemove is no longer triggered until you click (click anywhere on the screen)
[07:51:41] <kborchers> Jaac: if you need help but don't want people to see the site, that makes it hard. you can always make a simple test case on http://jsfiddle.net with a piece of your code
[07:52:54] <Jaac> kborchers: I totally agree, and ill try to get something working on jsfiddle, But since im working with AJAX data, i don't know how to get a decent example in there. But ill figure something out.
[07:52:55] <Krambfhase> guy: works for me, Fx4
[07:53:01] <Krambfhase> errr, 5 i mean :/
[07:53:10] <lathan> caz_, because if you load the content in from ajax, document ready has already fired
[07:53:12] <guy> Krambfhase: I am using FF5 as well. Are you sure, though?
[07:53:22] <kborchers> guy: seems ok in Chrome
[07:53:23] <lathan> caz_, what I think I fixed, is that the context div was already loaded
[07:53:27] <guy> wtf.
[07:53:45] <lathan> caz_, if #pages #section-knowledge isn't in the tree when that code runs, nothing will happen
[07:53:50] <lathan> *tree = DOM
[07:54:47] <Krambfhase> That hand is pretty creepy though.
[07:55:18] <guy> Krambfhase: I know, but client insists.
[07:55:36] <kollapse> lathan: Any ideas ?
[07:56:11] <lathan> kollapse, I haven't used it, and don't have the time to create my own demo
[07:56:15] <lathan> ?demo @ kollapse
[07:56:16] <bot-t> kollapse, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:56:38] <caz_> lathan: sure, but how can I fire new js code sample after the DOM was modified?
[07:56:48] <jeffsmykil> is my syntax correct here: $("input[type='radio'][name='style'][value='new']").val(":checked");
[07:57:02] <lathan> caz_, nothing special, just don't put it in document ready
[07:57:18] <lathan> jeffsmykil, it looks valid
[07:57:20] <kollapse> lathan: Hmm, not needed anymore I see. The problem occurs when using Opera's Dragonfly debugger or Firefox's Firebug. I guess they add some watches that slow down JS.
[07:57:29] <lathan> jeffsmykil, you could replace the type=radio with :radio
[07:57:31] <caz_> lathan: Will try but i think it's what I just tried before
[07:57:40] * lathan nods @ kollapse
[07:57:43] <jeffsmykil> so input:radio?
[07:59:11] <joikus_> What's a clean way to know if one of the radio buttons are checked? alert($('input[name=level]:checked')); did not work
[07:59:46] <lathan> jeffsmykil, for the first part, yah
[07:59:49] <lathan> cleaner....
[07:59:52] <newguyme> is there a good resource for looking at the changes between versions of jquery? i.e. between 1.3.x and 1.4.x etc?
[08:00:09] <lathan> joikus_, $('input:radio....').is(':checked')
[08:00:17] <joikus_> argh right, th
[08:00:18] <lathan> or 'input:radio....:checked').length
[08:00:19] <joikus_> thx lathan
[08:00:26] <jeffsmykil> lathan: I dont want to check if its checked
[08:00:31] <jeffsmykil> lathan I want to check it
[08:00:56] <lathan> .attr('checked',true)
[08:01:09] <jeffsmykil> yeah trying something with that now
[08:01:39] <lathan> jeffsmykil, if you are using jQuery 1.6, you can use prop, see ?prop
[08:01:40] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[08:01:48] <lathan> ?prop#sig
[08:01:49] <bot-t> lathan, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/#sig
[08:01:51] <jeffsmykil> nah using 1.4.1
[08:02:05] <lathan> ?.prop( propertyName, value )
[08:02:06] <bot-t> lathan, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[08:02:16] <lathan> jeffsmykil, then just use .attr('checked',true)
[08:02:22] <lathan> and removeAttr('checked') to remove
[08:03:11] <jeffsmykil> oh mam
[08:03:15] <jeffsmykil> capital letter
[08:03:16] <Dangr_> Hey all, whats the IRC command to clear the window?
[08:03:20] * jeffsmykil smacks himself
[08:03:22] <Dangr_> I can't recall :P
[08:05:14] <joikus_> $('input[name=PrePopType]').change(function () { ... }
[08:05:15] <jeffsmykil> man this should be easy
[08:05:17] <jeffsmykil> whats my problem
[08:05:24] <joikus_> how can I also use this for onmouseover
[08:05:26] <joikus_> not just .change
[08:05:41] <joikus_> in the same line, is it possible?
[08:05:50] <Dangr_> joikus_: like .hover(); ?
[08:06:30] <kborchers> joikus_: $('input[name=PrePopType]').bind("change mouseover", function() {...});
[08:06:49] <jeffsmykil> ill just give them ids and try that
[08:06:55] <joikus_> ah nice
[08:08:10] <Dangr_> joikus_: http://api.jquery.com/bind there is a section on Multiple Events
[08:08:33] <yogurt_truck> in jquery return false still kills _all_ further propagation, and not just the default, right?
[08:09:02] <kborchers> ?stopPropogation @ yogurt_truck
[08:09:03] <bot-t> yogurt_truck, event.stopPropagation() - This method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[08:09:21] <yogurt_truck> so the answer is no?
[08:09:41] <kborchers> yogurt_truck: I don't think so.
[08:10:17] <lathan> joikus_, .bind('change mouseover',function.....)
[08:10:37] <lathan> oops, sry joikus_ old news.....
[08:10:39] <yogurt_truck> kborchers: but it used to stop all propagation in previous versions, right? which is why people said "you actually mean e.preventDefault(), not return false!"
[08:11:05] <phlp> yogurt_truck: yes returning false calls preventDefault and stopPropagation
[08:11:12] <lathan> yogurt_truck, returning false will prevent default and stop all propogation
[08:11:26] <lathan> yep
[08:11:48] <lathan> yogurt_truck, the stuff I do, i don't see why I should let propogation continue if i've already handled the event.....
[08:12:02] <lathan> so I just return false, and take a little flak from the guys here
[08:12:10] <yogurt_truck> :>>
[08:21:03] <sunmao> Hi! I have got a code like this: http://pastebin.com/vYDE2HeF the dayData.arrive values are +2 -12 +29. The dayData is a JSON object and the arrive is an attribute for this object. When I load the page it adds the 'normal' class everywhere. Which means the first condition always fires. At the first to cases this is okay. But at the third option (+29) should add the 'late' class...
[08:21:59] <jeffsmykil> anyone have issues with radio buttons in IE?
[08:22:04] <jeffsmykil> like them not working at all?
[08:24:04] <lathan> jeffsmykil, change event doesn't fire until they lose focus
[08:24:15] <lathan> to fix that: bind to click and change event
[08:24:25] <lathan> (and be prepared to handle false-positives)
[08:24:49] <jeffsmykil> lathan: same with checkboxes?
[08:25:22] <lathan> ah.......I'm not sure @ jeffsmykil
[08:25:27] <lathan> but possible...
[08:25:30] <lathan> ?tias @ jeffsmykil
[08:25:31] <bot-t> jeffsmykil, Try It And See
[08:25:39] <jeffsmykil> lathan: screw it ill use links instead
[08:25:43] <lathan> lol
[08:29:05] <guy> any idea why dragging doesn't work in IE?
[08:29:06] <guy> http://anuary.com/dev/hp/pad3/
[08:29:31] <codecab> which is the fastest way to select ALL td from FIRST tr in a particular table??
[08:29:41] <phlp> sunmao: your first if isnt going to do what you expect. you should use (-15 <= dayData.arrive && dayData.arrive <= +15)
[08:30:18] <sunmao> phlp: yeah thanks I already got it
[08:30:39] <phlp> :)
[08:30:40] <Sarkie> Hi guys, should I be able to do this? $('meta[property=og:title]').attr('content'); ?
[08:31:30] <kborchers> codecab: $("#table tr:first").children("td")
[08:32:50] <phlp> Sarkie: try [property="og:title"]
[08:34:00] <lathan> Sarkie, you need quotes around attribute values if there are any other symbols in the value you are searching for
[08:34:07] <guy> any idea why dragging doesn't work in IE?
[08:34:08] <guy> http://anuary.com/dev/hp/pad3/
[08:34:15] <Sarkie> phlp, ty, I wasn't thinking, i was trying to escape the :
[08:34:20] <Sarkie> all fixed now
[08:34:33] <_pr0t0type_> Hello everyone
[08:34:56] <asdfChile> hi, is it possible to get the "a:visited" css rule?
[08:35:08] <lathan> asdfChile, what do you mean by "get" it
[08:35:15] <asdfChile> obtain color value
[08:35:41] <lathan> asdfChile, why is your javascript needing to tamper with that css value?
[08:35:57] <lathan> asdfChile, (not that I know of......, but I haven't done a goolge search...)
[08:36:00] <lathan> ?google
[08:36:01] <bot-t> lathan, Google - http://www.google.com/
[08:36:27] <tolborg> I am trying to build a feature for a band website. The feature is basically four buttons which the user is able to click. If a user clicks the button in the right combination a reaction is fired. Can any of you help me google search for clues to do this?
[08:36:31] <asdfChile> i'm looking to obtain those value to see if basic usability rules r been used
[08:36:55] <asdfChile> like keeping links blues and with an underline
[08:37:05] <tolborg> ... its the secret click combination thing which I need help to do
[08:37:06] <asdfChile> which can be done
[08:37:19] <lathan> ?g jquery kunami code @ tolborg
[08:37:20] <bot-t> tolborg, Konami Code jQuery Plugin: Pointlessly Easy - GetHiFi - http://www.gethifi.com/blog/konami-code-jquery-plugin-pointlessly-easy
[08:37:24] <lathan> tolborg, something like that ^
[08:37:33] <asdfChile> but the a:visited is the problem
[08:38:24] <lathan> asdfChile, well you could get the css color from the first visited link you find.... :(
[08:38:35] <lathan> asdfChile, $('a:visited:first').css('color')
[08:38:42] <tolborg> lathan: haha thats awesome.. ill have to figure out a way to limit the buttons, but thanks!
[08:38:45] <lathan> not optimal, but ....
[08:38:59] <lathan> tolborg, yah, you want to focus on the queueing system, and redo your own events
[08:41:11] <naquad> hi
[08:41:34] <djQuery> tolborg: build an array of the secret value.  every time they click on one of the links add it to the end of another array. after click compare the last 4 of the new array == the secret array.
[08:41:35] <asdfChile> thing is $('a:visited... won't return anything
[08:41:37] <naquad> are there any plugins able to put overlay with spinner over specified element (too lazy to create that)?
[08:42:27] <guy> seriously guys. I am stuck here as hell
[08:42:28] <phlp> asdfChile: it wont work because it is a security issue. browsers dont let you see which links are visited
[08:42:30] <guy> any idea why dragging doesn't work in IE?
[08:42:31] <guy> seriously guys. I am stuck here as hell
[08:42:48] <asdfChile> ooh k
[08:43:02] <asdfChile> can i access a particular css rule tough?
[08:43:43] <asdfChile> as if i get the id/class of any link, and check the css rule for what i'm looking for
[08:43:58] <asdfChile> in that particular rule
[08:44:30] <sunmao> thanks at all bye
[08:44:35] <atrigent> is there an easy way to get the size of a scrollable area?
[08:45:08] <atrigent> what I'm currently doing is position() + width of last element
[08:45:10] <tolborg> djQuery thats a good idea. I would like that they are able to enter more than 4 values though. I could add a button to let them 'fire' their answer then
[08:45:12] <atrigent> is there a better way?
[08:46:09] <lathan> idk asdfChile
[08:46:10] <djQuery> tolborg: still the same thing u just dont do the comaprision till they click a 5th buttn
[08:47:01] <tolborg> djQuery: but wont that only give 4*4*4*4 possibilities or something?
[08:47:27] <tolborg> if I do the comparison on the 5th click, they wont be able to enter codes longer than 4 clicks?
[08:47:42] <tolborg> am I misunderstanding something?
[08:48:41] <lathan> tolborg, are you wanting a variable length code?
[08:48:56] <tolborg> lathan: yea thats what I am thinking... but I havent thought it through
[08:49:19] <phlp> asdfChile: I dont know if there is an easier way but you could loop through document.styleSheets checking .cssRules.selectorText for ":visited" then look in .style for the color
[08:49:51] <lathan> phlp, asdfChile, ouch...that sounds like a bit of work. How much is this worth to you asdfChile ?
[08:50:11] <tolborg> I might make a display which lets users see what they are entering. The display will have room for (lets say) 8 values. When they have click a button the value is shown in the display. When all 8 values are filled out the comparison will happen
[08:50:44] <asdfChile> worth a try i guess
[08:55:33] <djQuery> tolborg: all that is adjustable. check the length of your secret var to see if they have enetered enough clicks
[08:56:20] <djQuery> tolborg: then do a slice of the answer var based on the length of the secret var
[08:56:52] <tolborg> djQuery: thats brilliant
[08:57:16] <djQuery> tolborg: no its just thinkin
[08:57:26] <phlp> guy: did you fix it?
[08:57:29] <djQuery> I think I was still even way inside the box there
[08:57:35] <tolborg> thinkin with the right conceptual tools available :)
[08:57:35] <guy> the drag thing?
[08:57:40] <phlp> yes
[08:57:49] <guy> the reason: IE didn't drag the object, because it was an image
[08:58:11] <guy> I didn't find the solution yet (other than making it background image or adding overflow element)
[08:58:23] <tolborg> djQuery: well.. I have just recently stepped beyond merely implementing accordions i.e. :P
[08:58:25] <phlp> you need to cancel IEs drag event $('img').bind('drag', function() { return false; });
[08:58:38] <Guest72103> need help with eable to work on + and - for the slider. some1 help http://jsfiddle.net/yAeby/1/
[08:59:36] <guy> phlp: didn't work: tried.

[09:06:54] <guy> phlp: that disabled the dragging event as well

[09:10:03] <phlp> guy: where did you put it? i cant find it in any of your code
[09:10:14] <guy> li.find('img').bind('mousedown', function(){ return false; });
[09:10:38] <phlp> drag not mousedown
[09:10:57] <phlp> ie has special events for dragging things like images
[09:20:06] <DarsVaeda> hi, I want my datepicker from jquery-ui to send the date as "yy-mm-dd" which works, but it should display the date in the fields as "dd-mm-yy" which does not work, where do I set that? there is that line at the example with parseDate but if I change that line I get errors
[09:21:05] <pilgrim> It seems that I can use .outerHTML() but can't find documentation on the jquery site about it. Is this deprecated or something?
[09:21:17] <Sora_> DarsVaeda
[09:21:20] <erichynds> DarsVaeda: bind to the change event or whatever it is of the datepicker, and set a hidden form field with the formatted date
[09:21:30] <ajpiano> there has never been an outerHTML method in jQuery, pilgrim
[09:21:33] <guy> phlp: thank you! I've misread what you were saying the first time
[09:21:35] <ajpiano> and it is not planned
[09:22:03] <DarsVaeda> erichynds: nah you can format the date somehow within the datepicker...somehow
[09:22:14] <Sora_> create new Date('datefromcalendar')
[09:22:16] <pilgrim> ajpiano: Why does it work?! Is this an EMCAScript thing?
[09:22:33] <ajpiano> it's an IE only property...
[09:22:39] <phlp> guy: np :)
[09:22:41] <erichynds> DarsVaeda: if you want the date to submit differently than waht is displayed in the input, you have to either change the input value or set a hidden form field
[09:22:43] <pilgrim> ajpiano: It's working on chrome!
[09:22:43] <ajpiano> and definitely not a method anywhere
[09:23:45] <guy> phlp: I've one more problem with this, if you can spare a minute. See the difference between how the zoomout feature works in FF5 and how it works in Safari/IE/Chrome
[09:24:31] <guy> basically, in FF5 it zooms out back to center; and in other browsers, it zooms out back to left side and then suddenly jumps to center
[09:25:14] <swiggy> http://jsfiddle.net/AsMma/ -- notice how the &position=1-40
[09:25:20] <swiggy> why doesnt it just say '1' ???
[09:25:41] <swiggy> it shouldnt say &position=1-40,    should say &position=1

[09:46:02] <DroMastaP> Hey, little question guys, what IDE are u using, and why in few words ? ( please answer with "===>" tag before :) )
[09:48:36] <systemfault> There's no good IDE for Javascript.
[09:48:48] <systemfault> Webstorm being the less awful.
[09:49:08] <DroMastaP> awful ? what do you mean ? ( i'm french ^^ )
[09:49:11] <systemfault> So, pick whatever you like, IDE.. Editor.. Pencil and start writing.
[09:49:34] <jayd3e> Basically, I have a vector library that works excelently in Firefox for drawing a large number of independently movable objects, but in IE it fails.  So I am trying to optimize the library for IE, but I don't know what I am doing
[09:49:36] <systemfault> Je dis qu'il n'y a AUCUN bon IDE pour javascript, le moin pire étant webstorm.
[09:49:51] <systemfault> Alors, prend ton éditeur préféré.
[09:49:57] <jayd3e> I can use the profiler in developer tools to see where the code spends most of it's time, but there are very few ways of telling what is inefficient
[09:50:09] <DroMastaP> Bah je viens sonder un peu les developpeurs
[09:50:29] <DroMastaP> webstorm, je vais jeter un oeil
[09:50:41] <systemfault> jayd3e: Use the tree view then click on the nodes where the timings are the highest.
[09:51:29] <DroMastaP> what do you think about Netbeans IDE ?
[09:52:17] <Kambfhase> I like that p'n'p IDE. It just feels like, if it was real. The graphics are awesome, but the syntax highlighting sucks. May be my config is wrong though
[09:52:27] <systemfault> DroMastaP: Like any Java IDE, it's slow.
[09:52:40] <DroMastaP> yep...
[09:52:43] <systemfault> DroMastaP: Webstorm is also a java IDE but its autocompletion actually works.
[09:52:45] <DroMastaP> p'n'p ?
[09:53:08] <Kambfhase> pen and paper
[09:53:25] <jedimind_> lol
[09:53:28] <DroMastaP> i'm searching for a good IDE, simple as possible, but not too much simple ( like npp )
[09:53:36] <jedimind_> aptana.org
[09:53:51] <DroMastaP> beautiful if possible, with a good support for syntax colors
[09:54:21] <DroMastaP> aptana, what is good with him ? :)
[09:54:35] <wontoner> DroMastaP: I'm using Aptana Studio 3 and I think it's pretty decent
[09:55:01] <DofLeFou> I have a little with JQuery .... autocomplete
[09:55:26] <DroMastaP> what is specially good with aptana ?
[09:55:32] <wontoner> DroMastaP: SFTP integration is built in, code highlighting seems to function well, color themes are easy to change, debug functionality for PHP works nicely as well
[09:55:55] <DroMastaP> mmhh....
[09:56:02] <DroMastaP> i'm gonna see that
[09:59:10] <DroMastaP> 133 Mo oO
[09:59:15] <DroMastaP> wow :/

[10:47:30] <Kambfhase> why not use one of the over 9000 scriptloaders out there?
[10:48:10] <Kambfhase> jQuery version 1.2.6? you like it rough, eh?
[10:48:58] <balazsbela> hmm, didn't even check the version
[10:49:02] <balazsbela> shouldn't it work though ?

[11:08:57] <d4rklit3> could i attach an arbitrary attribute to an element (e.g. 'data' : storedString)
[11:09:14] <djQuery> d4rklit3: see ?.data

[11:10:14] <Haprog> .data() just reads and writes those. just use that

[11:11:59] <DofLeFou> http://jsfiddle.net/2vz9G/6
[11:12:41] <DofLeFou> My issue is $('table label').each(function() .... is adding all the the label
[11:12:50] <djQuery> <label data-summary="sum1"
[11:13:13] <djQuery> thenyou could loop through all the ones tha have a data-summary attribute.
[11:13:27] <davidmurdoch> kborchers Why would jquery tabs disable a tab just because the document.location.href values are the same?
[11:13:27] <DofLeFou> how can be td specific
[11:13:28] <davidmurdoch> WTF?
[11:13:49] <djQuery> this way the one function could handle multiple columns
[11:13:50] <davidmurdoch> Oh, i'm initializing with {selected:-1}
[11:14:57] <adrianmg> hi!
[11:14:59] <mintsmeat> i cant recreate it in fiddle but heres the link http://videoproduction.com/wordpress/  you have to check it in ie to see the problem

[11:15:40] <adrianmg> .parent.click() got a function, is it possible to not execute it when user clicks on links contained in that .parent container?
[11:15:51] <davidmurdoch> sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/musicisair/kptAq/2/
[11:15:55] <djQuery> DofLeFou: you would probably be better off specifying in the header which collumns should be sumuraized though
[11:16:03] <tux__> function Page(var x){$("#main").load(x);}
[11:16:06] <tux__> is this correct?
[11:16:20] <DofLeFou> header?

[11:20:12] <DofLeFou> djQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/2vz9G/8
[11:20:42] <kborchers> davidmurdoch: are you planning on loading content via AJAX?
[11:21:04] <davidmurdoch> kborchers: When initially loading my page the content for the currently active tab is already present.
[11:21:04] <davidmurdoch> and yes
[11:21:09] <d4rklit3> Haprog gthanks
[11:21:16] <d4rklit3> was looking at jquery.data and it wasn't working
[11:21:21] <d4rklit3> didn't see the .data()
[11:22:02] <djQuery> d4rklit3: even though bot-t gave you a link to it
[11:22:11] <davidmurdoch> kborchers: But I can't just use href="#tab1" in the current tab
[11:22:21] <davidmurdoch> so, I'm using the current URL

[11:23:14] <davidmurdoch> kborchers, thanks...I already knew that would work. :-)
[11:23:24] <davidmurdoch> why can't I keep the href?
[11:23:49] <tux__> Can I make it fade in or something?
[11:23:54] <tux__> the content from load
[11:24:19] <kborchers> davidmurdoch: technically it does, it just tacks #Overview on the end
[11:24:44] <kborchers> davidmurdoch: it has to know which tab you are referring to so that it can open it on click
[11:24:57] <davidmurdoch> the title="Overview" is supposed to handle that according to the docs
[11:25:29] <davidmurdoch> where title.replace(" ", "_") === id of the container to re-use
[11:25:58] <davidmurdoch> Note that if you wish to reuse an existing container, you could do so by matching a title attribute and the container's id:  <li><a href="hello/world.html" title="Todo Overview"> ... </a></li> and a container like:  <div id="Todo_Overview"> ... </div> (Note how white space is replaced with an underscore)

[11:27:11] <g0bl1n> what's wrong with this code ? http://jsfiddle.net/XxseX/1/
[11:27:19] <g0bl1n> jQuery.data()
[11:27:31] <Kambfhase> g0bl1n: if you use jQuery.data( el) make sure that el is the native element!
[11:27:34] <phlp> DofLeFou: http://jsfiddle.net/2vz9G/10
[11:27:52] <g0bl1n> Kambfhase, native element ?
[11:28:05] <kborchers> davidmurdoch: but you're trying to have the first tab's content already exist in the tabs so it doesn't work that way. you have to use the method in the AJAX example's source which is basically what I showed you. by placing the current href in there, it will try to load itself into that tab and probably errors out though I don't know that for sure
[11:28:10] <Kambfhase> g0bl1n: http://jsfiddle.net/XxseX/2/
[11:29:11] <g0bl1n> Kambfhase, I couldn't find any reference to that in the documentation, will re-read it again

[11:29:57] <davidmurdoch> kborchers, I don't think that's the problem. I think it really should work that way. Why should ui.tabs care that the URL is the same? Page content can change with each refresh.

[11:31:19] <kborchers> davidmurdoch: when tabs sees an actual URL in there, that is its queue to load the tab content via AJAX. You are saying load the contents of this page into the tab.
[11:31:43] <djQuery> still need to loop through all the trs and grab the corresponding td but do you see where I was going with this?

[12:04:03] <Sora_> dont need a plugin
[12:04:06] <Sora_> yes
[12:04:39] <Sora_> hablas español cierto
[12:05:34] <djQuery> nddery: yes that should work cross browser. recent browsers will see it as legit html5 code and older ones will jsut treat it as custom attributes
[12:05:37] <phyntek> si
[12:05:49] <Krinkle> khaan: http://jsfiddle.net/6mCEh/3/
[12:06:19] <nddery> djQUery: thank you!
[12:06:27] <djQuery> nddery: and .data will work on both
[12:06:34] <djQuery> nddery: see ?.data
[12:06:34] <bot-t> nddery, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[12:07:28] <Woet> .data is awesome :)
[12:08:03] <phyntek> Sora_: Lo estou utilizando porque estoy duplicanto unos inputs, y cuando los duplico tengo que ejecutar una funcion
[12:11:42] <jedimind_> $this.css('backgroundImage', $('img', $this).attr('src')); whats wrong with this?
[12:11:49] <jedimind_> oh and hi, how is everyone, etc
[12:12:04] <Woet> jedimind_: use background-image instead of backgroundImage
[12:12:10] <Woet> .css uses the actual css names, not the javascript ones.
[12:12:54] <Woet> or it might work both, i'm not too sure to be honest
[12:14:30] <jedimind_> that doesnt sound right
[12:14:32] <Woet> ?paste @ jedimind_
[12:14:32] <bot-t> jedimind_, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:14:49] <jedimind_> its just taht one line that's not working, there's nothing else to paste
[12:14:49] <izepstan> someone maybe experience with nyroModal?
[12:14:50] <Kambfhase> try $this.find('img')
[12:15:02] <Woet> jedimind_: your html? your css?
[12:15:14] <Woet> put all on jsfiddle so we can fiddle with it
[12:15:14] <Woet> :)
[12:15:43] <Kambfhase> i think both jsvscript style and cssstyle names might work. not sure, though
[12:15:55] <Woet> aha, i got it jedimind_
[12:16:10] <Woet> try $this.css('backgroundImage', 'url('+$('img', $this).attr('src')+')');
[12:16:17] <Woet> Kambfhase: yea, I tested it, it both works
[12:16:17] <jedimind_> oh duh
[12:16:26] <Jakey> hahaha
[12:16:37] <Jakey> and i thought ur css ninja jed
[12:16:45] <Jakey> how can u forget that
[12:16:48] <jedimind_> haha shush
[12:16:53] <jedimind_> it's monday
[12:17:05] <jedimind_> thanks for the extra set of eyes Woet
[12:17:16] <Kambfhase> classic
[12:17:16] <Woet> np jedimind_
[12:22:08] <eazyigz> Hello, I am trying to do something like
[12:22:10] <eazyigz> $("#mvf_image").css({'background-image':'css/images/MVF2_background.jpg', 'width':'700','height':'583'});
[12:22:13] <eazyigz> is that correct??
[12:23:04] <nail_> url(css/images/...)
[12:23:37] <eazyigz> thanks
[12:24:16] <nail_> welcome
[12:24:41] <Kambfhase> lulz
[12:29:52] <Kambfhase> JS is driving my nuts.
[12:30:25] <Jakey> need help?
[12:30:28] <Jakey> i'm bored now
[12:32:16] <Kambfhase> i am writing a tutorial, kinda.
[12:33:05] <Jakey> Kambfhase link?
[12:33:18] <Jakey> what kind of tut? begin ? or a guide
[12:33:29] <Kambfhase> Objects in Javascript: https://gist.github.com/6c67da7d52397aacf557 fell free to prrof read
[12:36:29] <Kambfhase> It has like 270 lines and still not half of the content i want it to have
[12:36:55] <eazyigz> I am trying to set backgroundImage of a div.  But unless I specify a width/height of the img, it doesn't render.
[12:36:59] <eazyigz> is that a known issue?
[12:37:27] <Jakey> Kambfhase, why are you writing it in github?
[12:37:43] <Jakey> eazyigz its a css issue
[12:38:00] <necromancer> Jakey: github is a langauge now? ;)
[12:38:03] <Jakey> and of course it needs dimension to disp\lay
[12:38:19] <eazyigz> Jakey: my main problem is that in my css I do media queries in order to resize this image on different mobile devices.
[12:38:26] <Jakey> necromancer its for placing code and docs not for tuts dam it lol
[12:38:27] <necromancer> eazyigz: #css
[12:38:30] <eazyigz> so it appears I cannot get this functionality to work with jquery?
[12:38:48] <izepstan> how can i set the position with nyromodal to absolute?
[12:38:52] <necromancer> eazyigz: yes you need to set width & height if you have a background-image, btw
[12:39:09] <necromancer> you should just set it in CSS so you don't have to worry about it in JS
[12:39:23] <Kambfhase> I dont have a page/blog atm. And its easier for ppl to contribute on github than if i were using latex
[12:39:27] <eazyigz> necromancer: it works fine if i set it statically in css.  But it isn't the functionality I am looking for in jQuery - namely with media queries
[12:39:33] <necromancer> eazyigz: are you using CSS3?
[12:40:24] <eazyigz> necromancdr: @media in css3
[12:40:37] <jedimind_> how do you get the eq / index of a currently clicked element? in the case where i have a number of LIs inside a list, want to know what index the item clicked is
[12:40:38] <eazyigz> necromancer: sorry for misspelling your name
[12:40:56] <Woet> eazyigz: try necro-tab-
[12:41:02] <Woet> any decent client supports completion of nicks :)
[12:41:12] <eazyigz> Woet: thanks, didn't know about that in XChat
[12:41:15] <necromancer> Kambfhase: have you seen this? http://javascript.crockford.com/inheritance.html
[12:41:16] <Jakey> Woet mirc
[12:41:53] <necromancer> eazyigz: first of all i would advise against scaling images using CSS. make a bunch of different images and choose which one to use with javascript
[12:42:15] <necromancer> although i have no experience using the transform: property with scaleX and scaleY
[12:42:33] <eazyigz> necromancer: what's wrong with max-width/max-height with media queries?
[12:42:37] <eazyigz> it has worked fine for me...
[12:42:38] <Jakey> jedimind_: using each
[12:42:45] <necromancer> eazyigz: doesn't support IE6
[12:42:45] <Jakey> and checked the value manually
[12:43:00] <necromancer> but then again, @media isn't either :)
[12:43:07] <eazyigz> necromancer: IE6 isn't relevant, since my media query only targets mobile devices
[12:43:26] <necromancer> eazyigz: honestly though you shouldn't be setting @media in the CSS, you should be setting it when you load it via <link>
[12:43:33] <necromancer> <link media="mobile, touch">
[12:43:39] <necromancer> and then use a mobile.css file or something
[12:43:50] <Woet> necromancer: people still support ie6?
[12:43:51] <jedimind_> Jakey, a better potion than that :)
[12:43:53] <necromancer> @import and @media are implemented differently in every browser and may cause issues
[12:43:58] <jedimind_> option*
[12:44:03] <jedimind_> though potion works i suppose
[12:44:04] <Woet> even microsoft itself made a please-die-ie6 page
[12:44:07] <necromancer> Woet: not all the time. i still have to make IE6-compatible sites sometimes
[12:44:16] <necromancer> Woet: they should translate that to chinese then...
[12:44:24] <necromancer> because they haven't gotten the message yet
[12:44:30] <Kambfhase> I even got Crocks book. But i dont like new, constructors or Function.prototype.method
[12:44:35] <Woet> necromancer: pretty sure that's cause 90% of windows in chinese is warez :p
[12:45:03] <necromancer> Woet: http://www.codeanddesign-studio.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/Internet-Explorer-6-map1.gif
[12:45:10] <eazyigz> necromancer: you are right, but media queries are useful for mobile devices (webkit based).  If my site loads in IE6, then they just won't get triggered.  Which is fine
[12:45:23] <Woet> necromancer: yea, that's from microsofts site
[12:45:24] <Kambfhase> Most JavaScripters are stuck with this `new Klass( args)` pattern. I'd like to see something else, something better to be used
[12:45:48] <Woet> necromancer: http://www.ie6countdown.com/
[12:45:59] <necromancer> oh yeah
[12:46:00] <necromancer> :)
[12:46:09] <Woet> in yours it's 5.9%, now it's 5.7%
[12:46:12] <gar_onn> if I add .click(mycoolfunc) to one element will it be executed twice? if so, how do I prevet that?
[12:46:14] <Woet> 0.2% in 4 months
[12:46:17] <necromancer> nice
[12:46:24] <Woet> so.. 114 months ago
[12:46:25] <Jakey> jedimind: thats the only way
[12:46:27] <Woet> to go *
[12:46:33] <necromancer> Kambfhase: ...how else did you want to instantiate an object?
[12:46:56] <necromancer> or are you talking about JUST using prototypal inheritance
[12:47:41] <Woet> necromancer: awesome, in south korea ie6 usage is still 21.7%
[12:47:52] <Woet> necromancer: and 33.8% in china
[12:47:59] <Jakey> who cares
[12:48:21] <Woet> I don't, I put up a banner telling them to update and stopped supporting ie6/ie7
[12:48:23] <jedimind_> asian people do apparently
[12:48:32] * necromancer still had to create IE6 compatible sites in the last year due to corporate intranets not having updated versions of IE
[12:48:51] <necromancer> we haven't had an IE6 site in a while now though
[12:48:52] <jedimind_> i still do IE6 compatibility, but charge clients an extra 30% to do so;
[12:48:58] <jedimind_> most of them decide not to pursue it at that point
[12:49:02] <necromancer> oh yeah we technically do as well
[12:49:22] <necromancer> although my co-worker's pretty damn good at CSS so it's not like much time is wasted coding for IE 6
[12:49:31] <necromancer> we just can't use any cool new features like min- or max- dimensions
[12:49:39] <jedimind_> yeah, same, i can handle IE6 no problem, it's more of a convenience fee
[12:49:41] <necromancer> and some other stuff
[12:49:50] <jedimind_> thing is, i use those, but then i add extra stuff for IE6 to manage it
[12:49:53] <Woet> necromancer: you can with the !important workaround
[12:49:57] <jedimind_> or rather build it for IE6, then add the good stuff
[12:49:58] <Woet> it's a pretty easy hack
[12:50:04] <jedimind_> Woet, that only applies in certain cases
[12:50:09] <Woet> only 17% of my visitors use IE though, so i'm pretty lucky :)
[12:50:16] <Woet> and of that 17% only 2% is ie6
[12:50:44] <necromancer> Woet: yeah that's hit or miss. most of the time you just have to figure out another way to do it
[12:50:45] <Woet> so i really don't care about it
[12:50:58] <Woet> necromancer: usually worked for me though, but i haven't used it too much
[12:51:12] <necromancer> my personal feeling is that if you're using !important, you're doing it wrong
[12:51:17] <necromancer> unless it's a hack to fix something in IE of course
[12:51:32] <Kambfhase> necromancer: Its looks crazy it might not be useful foe everyone, but I still like it: https://github.com/Kambfhase/Din
[12:51:34] <necromancer> css is CASCADING style sheets
[12:52:38] <Kambfhase> I always thought the C in css stood for controversial
[12:54:01] <necromancer> Kambfhase: `Pirate.is( Pirate.create("Blackbeard")) // true` that's backwards! ;)
[12:54:39] <necromancer> Kambfhase: the only problem i see with that is what if you don't like writing your classes that way?
[12:54:42] <Kambfhase> yeah, this is not LISP though
[12:54:55] <necromancer> shouldn't it be Pirate.create("BlackBeard").is('Pirate')? ;)
[12:55:05] <Kambfhase> (is Pirate (create Pirate "Blackbeard"))
[12:55:11] <necromancer> heh
[12:55:16] <necromancer> oh lisp
[12:55:30] <necromancer> confusing the HELL out of AP comp sci folks since...
[12:56:46] <jedimind_> actually !important has its place, but it should be used sparingly
[12:56:54] <Kambfhase> the Problem with your pattern is that only Pirates can check if they are Pirates( no .is() on Object.prototype)
[12:56:54] <jedimind_> sometimes you just have to override specificity for whatever reason
[13:03:19] <Kambfhase> wow, es-dicuss is pure madness.
[13:03:47] <KindWord> jquery is cool stuff, glad it has such a big following, it deserves it :)
[13:04:58] <Kambfhase> Who is this jQuery and why does he write so many scripts?
[13:09:59] <necromancer>  Kambfhase: my pattern makes sense from a programmer's perspective, but not from the machine's :)
[13:10:23] <Kambfhase> yeah
[13:10:29] <necromancer> you're right, it makes more sense to put that .is() method on the base Object, not Pirate.
[13:10:45] <necromancer> i'm thinking of it like a rubyist
[13:10:58] <necromancer> although in JS, you can have methods be available globally right?
[13:11:05] <necromancer> that's how Math.floor() and stuff works
[13:11:31] <Kambfhase> I tried Ruby yesterday. Looks like Perl to me.
[13:11:44] <necromancer> you...don't know what perl looks like
[13:12:01] <Kambfhase> Perl looks like ancient Greek to me
[13:12:41] <necromancer> Kambfhase: Ruby's similar to Perl but doesn't look anything like it
[13:12:44] <necromancer> i mean kinda...
[13:13:00] <necromancer> but it's definitely more related to Python than anything else
[13:13:01] <KindWord> rumor is ruby is more powerful than perl
[13:13:07] <KindWord> :)
[13:13:22] <necromancer> "rumor"?
[13:13:26] <necromancer> hah
[13:13:33] <necromancer> it's not called Perl on Rails, is it? ;)
[13:13:40] <Seldon75> hi, I've just started out with jquery (converting from prototype).  I'm having a bit of trouble understanding selectors
[13:14:02] <necromancer> Seldon75: do you understand CSS selectors?
[13:14:25] <Seldon75> necromancer: yes
[13:14:29] <Seldon75> but it's not the same
[13:14:32] <Seldon75> let me explain
[13:14:42] <KindWord> lol
[13:14:50] <necromancer> ok
[13:14:51] <necromancer> lol
[13:14:54] <systemfault> It's exactly the same thing.
[13:15:04] <Jayflux> Seldon75 whats your problem? they are very similar
[13:15:25] <Seldon75> it seems like I can call jquery methods on a node like $('#mydiv').draggable(), but if I want to call native JavaScript properties and methods, I have to enter the array like: $('#mydiv')[0].innerHTML
[13:15:38] <necromancer> Seldon75: oh ok
[13:15:44] <Seldon75> is that true or am I being confused?
[13:16:06] <Seldon75> also, is there a shorthand notation that assumes there is only one element with the specified id
[13:16:07] <Jayflux> Seldon75 .prop() should handle DOM properties
[13:16:22] <necromancer> Seldon75: that's because $() returns a jQuery object, not a DOM object
[13:16:28] <Seldon75> yes
[13:16:38] <necromancer> you are not confused, that is the way to do it
[13:17:06] <Seldon75> i know I shouldn't expect the same here, but it was nice in Prototype that I could use the same notation and call native JS methods or PT methods
[13:17:24] <supsup> sup
[13:17:33] <vladikoff> sup sup
[13:17:39] <necromancer> Seldon75: that's actually why prototype is such an issue actually. it extends the DOM and interferes with the browser's own implementation of the DOM
[13:17:43] <Kambfhase> yeah, thats PTs biggest con though :)
[13:17:44] <necromancer> jQuery does not do that
[13:18:05] <Seldon75> so, I guess with jQuery i use the array notation before calling any native props or methods
[13:18:16] <supsup> necromancer i can make jquery do it.
[13:18:18] <Seldon75> thanks for confirming that
[13:19:55] <necromancer> Seldon75: that's right. prototype's 2 biggest cons are: 1.) it extends the DOM which causes discrepencies in different browsers (aka, shit doesn't work) and 2.) it attempts to inject a class-based architecture into JavaScript, which follows the prototypal, not classical model of inheritance.
[13:20:18] <necromancer> because you come from prototype, these will most likely be the 2 biggest hurdles you'll have to overcome in order to "get" jQuery
[13:20:39] <supsup> i just downloaded jQuery i got it alright.
[13:20:39] <systemfault> Yeah... and some stupid things.
[13:20:46] <necromancer> at the same time, you have a number of advantages over the average jQuery developer
[13:20:52] <necromancer> because you know that JS != jQuery ;)
[13:21:05] <necromancer> that separation is hard for some newbies to get
[13:21:08] <djQuery> anyone wanna learn javascript just saw that standford's cs101 class is moving to javascript http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs101/
[13:21:10] <tmayr> what?! it isnt?! heh
[13:21:13] <supsup> but jquery is but javascript.
[13:21:39] * necromancer smells a troll
[13:21:40] <Seldon75> i see ok
[13:22:10] <Kambfhase> what? I though that javascript was jQuery?
[13:22:19] <necromancer> what did it used to be djQuery?
[13:22:37] <tmayr> isnt jQuery the web version of java?
[13:22:41] <necromancer> lol
[13:22:48] <djQuery> necromancer: dunno
[13:22:53] <tmayr> :D
[13:22:54] <necromancer> interesting
[13:22:58] <djQuery> ?jsisjs@kambfhase
[13:22:58] <bot-t> kambfhase, When you use jQuery, you are also using JavaScript. There are many native JavaScript functions that do exactly what you need, and work in all browsers. If you are looking for "The jQuery Equivalent" of setTimeout, Math.random, ||, &&, etc, you already found it.
[13:22:59] <phlp> probably Java. academics are all about their Java
[13:23:21] <necromancer> lol djQuery Kambfhase just linked a JS framework that changed how you write it
[13:23:23] <djQuery> cool thing is that the entire course is out there
[13:23:30] <necromancer> i'm pretty sure he knows SOMETHING about js
[13:23:38] <necromancer> also that site sucks
[13:23:45] <necromancer> for a JS professor that guy sucks at web dev ;)
[13:23:53] <misterm> lol
[13:24:11] <misterm> He's not a JS professor...the class is actually not focused on "javascript development" at all
[13:24:20] <misterm> it's an entry level CS class that happens to use Javascript
[13:24:51] <djQuery> hence the cs101 and not javascript 101
[13:24:56] <misterm> I don't think most CS majors even take it
[13:25:29] <djQuery> would hope that most of them have enough of a background to where they could test out of it
[13:25:37] <Seldon75> so, just to confirm (before I refactor all my code), there's no shorthand alternative to $('#mydiv')[0] ?
[13:25:53] <Kambfhase> no
[13:26:00] <djQuery> unless ur some frycook that suddenly decides hey I wanna be a cs major
[13:26:22] <misterm> djQuery: I mean, I don't think it's on their track....I believe this class is mostly intended for like...economic majors who want some programming experience
[13:26:34] <misterm> CS majors would take a different intro class
[13:26:44] <djQuery> why are u needing the [0]?  gues short hand for that would be document.getElementById('mydiv')
[13:27:22] <djQuery> dunt know I only have a bs in bs
[13:27:22] <Seldon75> haha 'short' hand
[13:27:33] <phlp> Seldon75: most of the time you shouldnt need to do that. your innerHTML example would be .html() there is also .text() theres .prop for properties. why do you need the dom element?
[13:27:38] <Kambfhase> jQuery is Javascript? who was that guy that told me last week the jquery equivalent of setTimeout was $('<div>').animate("hide",1000,callback) ?
[13:28:16] <tmayr> Kambfhase: oh man, seriously? haha
[13:28:19] <Seldon75> phlp: I'm adding/removing child nodes, and checking for the existence of child nodes
[13:28:21] <djQuery> Kambfhase: well I am sure that would depend on the context
[13:28:22] <misterm> laugh if you want, but I'm pretty sure theres a jQuery plugin simply for setTimeout
[13:28:37] <djQuery> misterm: see ?dotimeout
[13:28:37] <bot-t> misterm, doTimeout, a jQuery plugin that takes the work out of delayed code execution, including interval and timeout management, polling loops and debouncing. In addition, it’s fully jQuery chainable - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-dotimeout-plugin/
[13:28:37] <misterm> a non-ironic one I mean
[13:29:09] <misterm> that's not the one I was talking about djQuery, but thanks
[13:29:25] <Kambfhase> ?fail @ tmayr
[13:29:25] <bot-t> tmayr, ((![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]])
[13:29:37] <tmayr> wait what
[13:29:52] <Kambfhase> thats brainfuck ;)
[13:30:00] <tmayr> does not compute.
[13:30:01] <b-lew> is there a way to have fancy box so the buttons are always there not just when you hover over the image?
[13:30:06] <misterm> ?eval ((![]+[])[+[]]+(![]+[])[+!+[]]+([![]]+[][[]])[+!+[]+[+[]]]+(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]])
[13:30:08] <bot-t> misterm: "fail"
[13:30:25] <Jakey> lol
[13:30:47] <djQuery> b-lew: depends does fancybox add some class to them when they are hovered? does it have a callback for when they are not hovered
[13:30:48] <diamonds> hey hey hey
[13:30:49] <diamonds> http://jsfiddle.net/9Qd3n/1/

[13:35:22] <BillCriswell> diamonds: .wrap() ?
[13:35:33] <diamonds> BillCriswell: did you see the fiddle?
[13:35:43] <kborchers> diamonds: this is very specific to your example but it works http://jsfiddle.net/kborchers/9Qd3n/2/
[13:35:50] <BillCriswell> Nope. Didn't look at the link.
[13:36:34] <kborchers> diamonds: the main idea is use .appendTo() but you have to insert the new div into the dom first
[13:37:07] <diamonds> wait, so you take the p's, append them to a div, then append the div back to the section?

[13:46:48] <larzen-wrk> folks -- i am trying to dynamically create a jquery UI tabs... it seems to work fine the first time, but the second time it doesnt work. I am essentially doing $('mytab').tabs() twice.
[13:47:07] <larzen-wrk> between that, I am emptying out the $('tabs') div to clear the old tabs.
[13:47:16] <nddery> I have a date in this format: 2011-07-11 06:00PM. how could I convert it to unix timestamp ?
[13:47:25] <larzen-wrk> I suspect there is already a jquery object that is bound to that dom ... but I am not sure how to destroy it.
[13:48:06] <Cork[home]> larzen-wrk: i don't think you can, the facroty will already be initialized and only call its default function
[13:48:09] <tmayr> nddery: http://www.electrictoolbox.com/unix-timestamp-javascript/
[13:48:24] <larzen-wrk> Cork[home]: how do i do this then?
[13:48:30] <Cork[home]> larzen-wrk: not sure you can
[13:48:40] <Cork[home]> you could try .tab('destroy')
[13:48:58] <Cork[home]> before you remove things to you need to run it again
[13:49:04] <nddery> tmayr: I've tried that, inserting my date in the Date parenthesis, or just replacing it, but it says either NaN or object something
[13:49:13] <Cork[home]> to==so
[13:50:17] <nddery> rmayr: object has no method 'getTime'
[13:52:34] <phlp> nddery: http://www.datejs.com
[13:53:16] <nddery> http://pastebin.com/QXGbrLdA
[13:53:54] <tmayr> yeah i was checking what could be done nddery, maybe the library that phlp linked can be useful
[13:54:56] <nddery> tmayr: im currently looking at datejs.. but seems to do much more than what I need
[13:56:10] <velts> what is the best way to determine if an image has been loaded in a browser?
[13:56:26] <velts> $myImg.load(function() { //loaded }); ?
[13:56:35] <nddery> phlp: with datejs, can I convert to UNIX timestamp ? (it not in the demo and cant see mroe information)
[13:57:31] <phlp> nddery: looks like .format("U") does it
[13:57:56] <tmayr> nddery: http://jsfiddle.net/Nspj7/
[13:57:58] <nddery> phlp: ok, I'll look into that
[13:58:59] <nddery> tmayr: havent tried it this way.. I was thinking less lines = better but I guess not always like that..
[13:59:10] <tmayr> you can condense that for sure
[13:59:45] <tmayr> http://jsfiddle.net/Nspj7/1/
[14:00:04] <phlp> i get NaN in FF4
[14:00:10] <tmayr> really?
[14:00:16] <nddery> I also get NaN
[14:00:19] <tmayr> works fine in chrome
[14:00:19] <nddery> in chrome
[14:00:22] <nddery> ..
[14:00:43] <tmayr> http://cl.omg.li/8MyU
[14:01:03] <tmayr> NaN in Ffx4 too, weird ;P
[14:02:28] <nddery> in the console it works but when I try to alert it it give me NaN..
[14:02:50] <tmayr> new Date("2011-07-11 06:00 PM") is an invalid date it seems
[14:02:58] <tmayr> strange that it works on chrome tho
[14:03:22] <nddery> yeah.. what is the js date format to use then ?
[14:03:27] <nddery> cause its a valid date
[14:03:47] <tmayr> console.log(new Date("2011-07-11")) outputs Date {Sun Jul 10 2011 20:00:00 GMT-0400 (CLT)}
[14:04:12] <tmayr> and as far as i know, 10 != 11, hah
[14:04:19] <tmayr> maybe it has to do with my CLT
[14:05:15] <nddery> the timestamp it returns in the console = Thu, 20 May 8032 23:46:40 GMT
[14:05:22] <nddery> , which is not what was entered
[14:05:28] <tmayr> oh man, hah
[14:05:54] <phlp> this is why i linked you to datejs.. js date handling sucks
[14:06:08] <nddery> yeah.. I'll give it a try.
[14:06:15] <nddery> does it add a lot of overhead ?
[14:07:17] <tmayr> nddery: you can do new Date(year, month, day, hour, minutes)
[14:07:25] <tmayr> that will output correctly in ffx and chrome
[14:07:30] <nddery> ooh
[14:07:30] <nddery> ok
[14:07:40] <nddery> I'll try this first
[14:07:52] <tmayr> one thing to take in consideration, months start from 0
[14:07:59] <tmayr> so 0 to 11, not 1 to 12
[14:07:59] <jedimind_> no they dotn!
[14:08:06] <phlp> and hour is 0-23
[14:08:14] <phlp> good luck
[14:08:18] <nddery> thanks
[14:08:20] <phlp> :)
[14:08:27] <tmayr> damn this js date thing sure does suck
[14:08:28] <tmayr> lol
[14:09:47] <dabear> Its based on the java implementation
[14:10:01] <tmayr> no wonder it sucks then, oh...
[14:10:46] <nddery> lol
[14:11:07] <Fish-Face> Hi, I'm getting some odd behaviour when debugging my page. In the success callback the $ alias is not the same as the jQuery function - is this normal, or an artifact of using the (Chrome) debugger, or what? When does it happen?
[14:11:52] <kborchers> ?demo @ Fish-Face
[14:11:52] <bot-t> Fish-Face, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[14:12:53] <Fish-Face> do I take it you're not aware of as a normal problem?
[14:12:56] <tmayr> Fish-Face: you're not using other library that uses the $ sign right?
[14:13:09] <Fish-Face> no I'm not - and it works as expected elsewhere
[14:13:37] <Fish-Face> but the $ function *does* map to that of other libraries in this case - it's just an alias for getElementById
[14:14:19] <lugzer> hi
[14:15:37] <Fish-Face> the thing that makes me wonder if it's something to do with the debugger is that $ is not jQuery (according to the debugger) if I break right after calling $(this) and getting the result I'd expect
[14:16:35] <Ebonwumon> Okay, so I'm just staring out with javascript and jquery. I have a form that has a section for an image upload. What methods can bring up the mimetype of the image a user has selected for upload? .val() just returns the filename.
[14:16:45] <Ebonwumon> Googling has failed me in this respect =\
[14:18:02] <systemfault> Ebonwumon: Why do you need to know?
[14:18:45] <Ebonwumon> I need to verify the filetype they're trying to upload.
[14:18:51] <Ebonwumon> The project only supports png.
[14:19:09] <Ebonwumon> That's not negotiable at this point (I'm an intern, and that's what I'm told =P)
[14:19:11] <systemfault> Check the extension..
[14:19:22] <Ebonwumon> systemfault, users are stupid.
[14:19:25] <lugzer> i'm trying to pass on a serialized form via .post() - with php the passed data was an array, serialize() passed it its own way, does that mean i should recreate the array after the form data is passed?
[14:19:36] <systemfault> Ebonwumon: How is that related?
[14:19:42] <Ebonwumon> It's my understanding that changing an extension does not change a mimetype, is this correct?
[14:19:52] <systemfault> ...
[14:19:59] <kborchers> Ebonwumon: you'll only be able to check extension until it gets to the server side where you can check mimetype. JS doesn't have access to the local file system
[14:20:34] <Ebonwumon> kborchers, curses. Thanks for your help.
[14:21:15] <Ebonwumon> But systemfault, what I was saying is, it would likely be the thought process of a few users that renaming their .jpg file to .png will effectively convert it.
[14:21:21] <Ebonwumon> That's why I don't want to trust extensions.
[14:21:40] <systemfault> Ebonwumon: You should never trust anything from a user.
[14:21:52] <systemfault> Ebonwumon: So you naively check client side with the extension
[14:21:59] <systemfault> Ebonwumon: Then you recheck server-side
[14:22:02] <Fish-Face> hmph, yeah I just verified it's an artifact of the debugger...
[14:22:53] <Ebonwumon> Thanks for the help guys, back to pumping out code o/
[14:25:38] <sterlo> What format does jQuery use for versioning? Something like http://semver.org/ or something else?
[14:28:40] <misterm> Ebonwumon: if you're using the filereader API, you can check the type clientside

[15:03:01] <johnl> Hi, jqueryui autocomplete behaves strangely with autoSelect enabled if the source is an ajax call that is a bit slow. under 1.8.14, when the menu displays it overwrites the input box with whatever was in the input box at the time the ajax request started
[15:03:55] <johnl> and under the latest code from git master, it works a bit better, but seems to make way too many ajax calls. starts new ones before the old one has completed.
[15:05:27] <johnl> anyone else seen this?
[15:08:44] <bl4ckcomb``> if I have several view files, containing html with placeholders to be used as jQuery templates, would you request the view files via a ajax and then construct the templates or would you merge them at the serverside and then return the merged js to the client to be executed?
[15:10:50] <multipass> is there a way to select the first 8 elements in a for each? i want to try to wrap 8 at a time
[15:11:44] <fostah> is there a way to filter your selector to the first 8 elements?
[15:13:05] <DroMastaP> Please guys, i'm tired, this *short* code doesn't work... something wrong ? =>>>>>> http://pastebin.com/Rdq7qay2
[15:14:01] <bl4ckcomb``> DroMastaP, :animated -> quotes
[15:14:54] <DroMastaP> lol ! thanks... I have to sleep :(
[15:14:59] <DroMastaP> you're the man ^^
[15:15:10] <DroMastaP> kiss from france

[15:16:46] <DroMastaP> nice :)
[15:16:50] <larzen-wrk> folks.. how would I pull out the 4th li out of a ul list with a jquery selector?
[15:16:53] <DroMastaP> thanks
[15:18:28] <rewt> larzen-wrk, something like this should work:  $('ul').find('li').eq(3)
[15:18:36] <DroMastaP> and have you tried my code ? cause I put a condition > if animated > do nothing. But it doesn't work, when I click multiple times on my two buttons, animation continue :/
[15:19:57] <drd> larzen-wrk: $('ul li:nth-child(4)') ?
[15:21:05] <bl4ckcomb``> DroMastaP, can you put both relevant code and markup in a fiddle? jsfiddle.net
[15:21:37] <DroMastaP> yep one min :)
[15:21:43] <jtannenbaum> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js is always the newest jquery, right?
[15:24:39] <whateverb> how can I validate email or number in 'mail' variable, tried -     if (!mail.match(/[0-9]([\w-\.]+)@((?:[\w]+\.)+)([a-zA-Z]{2,4})\be(\w*)s\b/g))
[15:24:43] <whateverb> but not working
[15:24:53] <DetroitOwnz> Can #jquery hold a sekrit for me?
[15:25:10] <DroMastaP> bl4ckcomb`` http://jsfiddle.net/5EjT5/
[15:25:32] <DroMastaP> it's french, dont worry about the text lol
[15:26:03] <bl4ckcomb``> DetroitOwnz, yes, just leave your personal data, social security number and bank account
[15:26:19] <DroMastaP> but my probleme is simple, when yuo click fast on the two buttons, sliding doesn't stop
[15:26:54] <DetroitOwnz> I jack off to Like a Virgin at work when I should be coding.
[15:27:01] <DetroitOwnz> Because Madonna is HAWT
[15:27:14] <DroMastaP> but in theory, buttons doesn't work when animation is working
[15:27:27] <niftylettuce> best approach for doing a JS whois/domain name checker?
[15:27:39] <DroMastaP> but i'm noob, don't know what is hte problem
[15:27:41] <niftylettuce> this is the direction I'm looking for http://ajaxwhois.com/
[15:27:47] <Techdeck> hey guys, any ideas how to make an ajax request from a non ssl page to an ssl page on the same domain?
[15:28:44] <bl4ckcomb``> DetroitOwnz, so you want to ignore click-events while there is an animation taking place?
[15:29:00] <DroMastaP> me ? ^^
[15:29:01] <DetroitOwnz> yes
[15:29:05] <bl4ckcomb``> eh
[15:29:12] <bl4ckcomb``> yes DroMastaP , sorry
[15:29:16] <DroMastaP> no prob
[15:29:23] <DroMastaP> yes, this is what I try to do
[15:29:34] <bl4ckcomb``> k, let's see
[15:29:41] <DroMastaP> thanks
[15:33:01] <bl4ckcomb``> DroMastaP, 'this' in the context of your event refers to the target of the event, being your button. Your button doesn't get :animated, but your $(".elastic") does, so you should test $(".elastic") instead of 'this'
[15:33:21] <halo> Hi all :)
[15:33:26] <DroMastaP> yesss.....
[15:33:35] <halo> Can someone help me with validation?

[15:33:58] <halo> Or I should to go to some another jquery channel (I see that they are thematical)?
[15:34:19] <bl4ckcomb`> halo, you can just ask your question

[15:36:55] <bl4ckcomb`> yeah, it's very useful for debugging
[15:37:48] <bl4ckcomb`> DroMastaP if you use PHP, then keep http://codepad.viper-7.com/ in mind
[15:38:05] <ajpiano> Pumukel: there is no suh function as postJSON unless someone in your environment defined it, it is not a native jquery method
[15:38:53] <DroMastaP> thanks bl4ckcomb`, I keep it in my favorites ;)
[15:38:57] <Pumukel> ajpiano, yes I know, but as you see in my post i define that function 2 line above call

[15:43:18] <DroMastaP> hey, is it possible to do that > if($(".elastic").not(":animated").lenght){........} ?
[15:43:35] <halo> So but with this code there isn't any validations for both options of selection.
[15:43:36] <DroMastaP> I saw that on a forum but impossible to make is work
[15:44:32] <halo> And if I use one validation call and setup all inputs as required than user must to fill inputs for ALL options. And this isn't correct.
[15:44:39] <halo> So what am I doin' wrong?

[16:32:17] <tbranyen> datarecall: http://jsfiddle.net/pKLuD/
[16:32:19] <tbranyen> works fine for me
[16:32:48] <datarecall> hmmm k maybe im missing something else
[16:41:20] <Sora_> hi
[16:59:49] <jtannenbaum> jquery-1.6.2.js is loaded before everything, nothing overwrites $, and yet $ is still undefined when my page loads
[17:05:16] <xwan> can someone please tell me what's wrong with this little code > http://jsfiddle.net/JSes2/
[17:06:25] <drd> xwan: what do you think is wrong with it?
[17:06:52] <xwan> my client tells me isn't working on safari (in mac) and in firefox
[17:07:52] <xwan> I tested in opera, firefox, safari, ie and works (windows) and some others in linux, and works well, but if the client tells me isn't working it could be an specific problem with my code
[17:08:30] <xwan> that's why I came here, with the experts
[17:10:05] <xwan> drd: do u see something wrong?
[17:10:46] <drd> xwan: seems to work, but your style could be better: http://jsfiddle.net/JSes2/2/
[17:11:05] <drd> (just tried in safari/mac, works fine..)
[17:11:52] <xwan> nice style, I didn't know I could do that
[17:12:04] <drd> yeah, saves a lot of time ;)
[17:12:34] <drd> note that you couldn't do .children().hide().click(showMore) because then it would be putting the click handler on the children
[17:13:11] <drd> you could do .children().hide().end().click(showMore) because .end() will undo the .children() filter
[17:13:25] <drd> however i have no idea why your client thinks it's not workin in safari/mac :)
[17:14:11] <xwan> then the end() is for telling "it's all for you, the next is for the parent"
[17:14:12] <jtannenbaum> http://i.imgur.com/7L0yt.png this is driving my ~crazy~
[17:14:28] <xwan> neither do I :(
[17:14:36] <jtannenbaum> $ is undefined.. but it's not undefined like an actual variable name that hasn't been defined
[17:14:48] <ajpiano> jtannenbaum: huh
[17:15:09] <jtannenbaum> jquery loads, completely, before anything else
[17:15:17] <ajpiano> are you in wordpress by any chance?
[17:15:20] <jtannenbaum> nope
[17:15:22] <ajpiano> hm
[17:15:26] <ajpiano> got al live page?
[17:15:40] <jtannenbaum> could I PM it to you?
[17:15:45] <xwan> drd: thanks dude
[17:15:45] <ajpiano> if you must
[17:15:56] <drd> xwan: np
[17:15:56] <rogeruiz> Hey
[17:16:15] <jtannenbaum> well actually.. it's more complicated, the live page has authentication
[17:16:25] <rogeruiz> Quick question about deferred callbacks in jQ 1.6
[17:16:28] <rogeruiz> 1.5*
[17:17:28] <jtannenbaum> let me write out on paper what scripts are loading at www.mysite.com/ (since $ is defined there) and what scripts are loading at mysite.com/foo-bar
[17:17:37] <jtannenbaum> where $ is 'undefined' yet not undefined
[17:18:39] <rogeruiz> With multiple Ajax requests, each callback will have to be tied to a variable right?
[17:19:00] <rogeruiz> Otherwise it'd be mayhem?
[17:19:06] <obsd123> has anyone in here used tablesorter?  Its columns headers are overflowing into multiple rows  - I know this is probably more of a CSS issue, but I don't do design stuff usually and it's making me rage.  Is there an easy way to overcome this?
[17:19:18] <ajpiano> rogeruiz,  uh, maybe?
[17:20:09] <obsd123> rogeruiz: rogeruiz: $.post('blah.ext', {}, function(data) {}); where data would be the return value of each individual ajax call
[17:21:20] <rogeruiz> For instance. I've read that another $.success() can be called after the Ajax request and completes after the successful request or immediately if the request has already completed a while back
[17:21:58] <ajpiano> yup
[17:22:10] <ajpiano> var foo = $.ajax( ... );
[17:22:33] <rogeruiz> obsd123: Each individual? Do you mean each callback the data would be different? If so then yes.
[17:22:42] <ajpiano> foo.then(function(data) {  console.log(data);  });
[17:23:05] <rogeruiz> Oh wow
[17:23:08] <rogeruiz> These are awesome
[17:23:19] <obsd123> rogeruiz: what you're saying is hard to understand, but it sounds like you're asking about how closures work
[17:24:13] <rogeruiz> No I get that. I was actually just curious how powerful these were, the answer kind of dawned on me while I was asking
[17:24:20] <rogeruiz> I wanted to make sure I understood the implementations
[17:24:25] <rogeruiz> Implications.
[17:24:32] <ajpiano> rogeruiz, and if you want to make multiple requests and do something when all of them are done
[17:24:33] <ajpiano> you can do
[17:24:44] <ajpiano> $.when( $.ajax(...), $.ajax(...), .... );
[17:25:02] <rogeruiz> You mean chain the requests together right?
[17:25:04] <ajpiano> .then(function(dataFromFirstReq, dataFromSecondReq) { });
[17:25:22] <ajpiano> no i mean, wait for when a group of async requests is completed
[17:25:33] <rogeruiz> Oh wow. So the data keeps getting called as arguments in the call back?
[17:25:52] <rogeruiz> I see
[17:27:13] <rogeruiz> Does .then() run on error and success or just success?
[17:27:14] <obsd123> are you sure you understand what a closure is?
[17:27:26] <ajpiano> rogeruiz, then runs on success
[17:27:29] <ajpiano> fail runs on error
[17:27:34] <ajpiano> .always() runs in either case
[17:27:34] <ajpiano> :)
[17:27:42] <rogeruiz> obsd123: I have a basic understanding of closure
[17:28:09] <rogeruiz> obsd123: If you want to point me to a good resource, id love to read it
[17:28:18] <obsd123> well that's the operative concept that governs why your callbacks will run with the proper data asynchronously
[17:28:36] <obsd123> not off the top of my head, but google is your friend!
[17:29:18] <rogeruiz> Ha thanks. I've been wrapping my head around JS: the good parts
[17:29:47] <rogeruiz> Im still a beginner though. I've switched careers from designer to front end development.
[17:30:26] <obsd123> yeah, I'm originally a C programmer and getting used to javascript has been a process for me too :)
[17:30:29] <rogeruiz> I guess when I think of closures I'm still thinking only of self executing anonymous functions
[17:30:36] <jroes> is it common / has anyone already implemented a sort of "soft dropdown" functionality -- using CSS spans and divs to create nicely styled dropdown boxes instead of using the typical select/option tags?
[17:30:36] <rogeruiz> Like ()();
[17:30:56] <jtannenbaum> jquerylint is telling me "trigger(ready) called incorrectly"
[17:31:14] <jtannenbaum> at Function.ready (http://foobar.mysite.com/static/scripts/jquery-1.6.2.js:440:24)
[17:32:48] <drd> jroes: we use one that converts a <select> into a <ul>
[17:32:54] <rogeruiz> Thanks ajpiano for the helpful advice and implementation examples
[17:33:48] <ajpiano> welcome
[17:33:50] <ajpiano> :)
[17:43:02] <PPKuma> hi, noob question. var foo = $('ul#bar') how can i select all the <a> inside foo's <li>?
[17:44:11] <ajpiano> foo.find("a")
[17:45:25] <PPKuma> ajpiano thanks :)
[17:55:45] <jroes> is there a shorter way to express this?
[17:55:45] <jroes> $('.dropdown-menu ul li:first').parent().parent().find('.toggle').html('HELLO WORLD')
[17:56:59] <mystline> $('.dropdown-menu').find('.toggle').html('hello')?
[17:57:13] <mystline> the 2x parent() would just be doing that anyway, i think
[17:57:19] <jroes> ah, cool
[17:57:48] <mystline> try it out, no guarentees though C: also i think searching by class is pretty slow
[17:58:10] <mystline> if you can it might be worth making $('.dropdown-menu') an id? or even .toggle if theres only one.
[17:58:27] <jroes> actually I guess technically it'll be getting hit in an event
[17:58:56] <jroes> I'm handling a click event on the .dropdown-menu li, so $(this) will be the original selector
[17:59:02] <Connorhd> the 2x parent() wouldn't necessarily be doing that
[17:59:08] <Connorhd> depending on the structure
[17:59:33] <jroes> $('.dropdown-menu li').live('click' function() { $(this).parent().parent().find('.toggle').html($(this).html()); }); is the full story, really
[17:59:58] <mystline> Connorhd: yes but im assuming div.dropdown-menu > ul > li
[17:59:59] <drd> so that's a bit different
[18:00:10] <mystline> oh
[18:00:11] <drd> $(this).parents('.dropdown-menu')
[18:00:51] <drd> this seems like it could use some state ;)
[18:01:02] <jroes> what do you mean :)
[18:01:18] <drd> jroes: like, along the lines of a jqui widget, where you have the parent node stored in a variable
[18:01:34] <drd> rather than traversing all over the place all the time
[18:01:45] <jroes> interesting
[18:01:55] <drd> that could be overkill, but you could also do something like:
[18:02:49] <jtannenbaum> http://i.imgur.com/MRo5r.png this. I don't get this..
[18:03:16] <jtannenbaum> $ is defined in jquery-1.6.2.js, not defined here
[18:03:47] <drd> $('.dropdown-menu').live(function() { var menu = $(this), toggle = menu.find('.toggle'); menu.find('li').click(function () { toggle.html($(this).html()); }
[18:03:56] <drd> if i typed it right ;)
[18:04:10] <Eviltwin> What do I need to do to make an event bubble?
[18:04:41] <Eviltwin> And how do I bind/catch it?
[18:08:09] <jtannenbaum> $ gets undefined between jquery-1.6.2.js and my main.js, I just don't know where
[18:08:26] <Eviltwin> I might be able to help
[18:08:50] <jroes> drd: are you just saying it could use some variables for clarity, or are you saying there are some things that should be done to improve performance? https://gist.github.com/8c6e64db8040a06b00c0
[18:09:14] <jtannenbaum> Eviltwin: ?
[18:09:31] <Eviltwin> jQuery 1.6.2?
[18:09:59] <jtannenbaum> uh
[18:10:10] <jtannenbaum> jquery-1.6.2.js yea
[18:10:12] <jtannenbaum> from the website
[18:10:54] <drd> jroes: a little bit of both..
[18:11:20] <Eviltwin> Try watching window.$
[18:11:23] <PPKuma> How can i load a Class file in my code?
[18:11:29] <drd> but now i see it's not possible to be as nice as i wanted, since your children are loaded dynamically?
[18:11:39] <jroes> yeah, I'm using backbone
[18:11:40] <drd> s/children/menu items
[18:11:57] <jroes> so the entire page is sort of being generated dynamically
[18:12:34] <jroes> although I could technically configure the menus each time I add to the page
[18:12:54] <drd> jroes: it's slow and fragile to do quite that much traversal
[18:13:35] <jroes> ah, I guess I never know it was that taxing to go up two levels and over one :)
[18:13:38] <jroes> knew*
[18:13:49] <Eviltwin> jroes: Is there only one .dropdown-menu ?
[18:14:01] <jroes> Eviltwin: nah, there are multiple
[18:14:04] <Eviltwin> jtannenbaum: Did you try watching window.$
[18:14:11] <jtannenbaum> I am doing that now
[18:14:31] <drd> jroes: in this case it's probably not a big deal re: performance
[18:14:41] <jroes> it doesn't seem so bad right now, but I guess it could add up
[18:14:56] <jroes> and if I move the menu state above then at least I don't have to traverse to the menu, which I think is what you were getting at
[18:14:59] <Eviltwin> drd: Could he cache the menu and ul in the li jq object?
[18:15:12] <drd> it's sort of an anti-pattern to have that much traversal going on for each event :)
[18:16:19] <drd> Eviltwin, i'm not sure enough of the implications to comment on that :) that's one area that i haven't explored enough
[18:16:27] <jtannenbaum> Eviltwin: before and after: http://i.imgur.com/7YYls.png
[18:17:10] <mikeycgto> typeof jQuery returns 'function'... yet jQuery sort of acts like an object (jQuery.ajax etc etc). can someone please explain how this is achieved?
[18:18:19] <Eviltwin> jtannenbaum: Mind if I see the entire contents of the $(document).ready(function () { ?
[18:18:28] <jtannenbaum> one sec
[18:18:53] <Eviltwin> mikeycgto: function A(){}; A.n = 2;
[18:19:07] <Eviltwin> You start with a function definition and add keys to it
[18:19:17] <jtannenbaum> Eviltwin: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/9435/
[18:19:18] <Eviltwin> JavaScript classes work in a similar manner
[18:19:30] <mikeycgto> ahh that makes sense
[18:19:44] <jtannenbaum> a lot of that wasn't written by me
[18:19:54] <mikeycgto> forgot you could do that ;)
[18:20:11] <greenail> hello
[18:20:24] <greenail> is it ok to ask questions in here?
[18:20:28] <jtannenbaum> yes
[18:20:37] <greenail> k, thanks
[18:20:38] <Eviltwin> jtannenbaum: There's not a "var $;" hanging around somewhere, is there?
[18:20:48] <jtannenbaum> I'll search
[18:20:58] <Eviltwin> Could be "var $ ="
[18:21:20] <jtannenbaum> "var $" returns no matches except one in jquery, var $this = foo
[18:21:35] <greenail> i'm looking to encode my application state using history.pushState, can anyone direct me to a good example of a very compact state encoding scheme for a url?
[18:21:37] <jtannenbaum> I've also searched for $= and $ = before
[18:21:49] <jtannenbaum> there's one in jsapi
[18:21:59] <Eviltwin> How are these included?
[18:21:59] <jtannenbaum> but that's loaded before jquery
[18:22:00] <mikeycgto> working on a "plugin" to "whine" when you have an empty jquery object (length is 0). i'm sure we've all done something like $('#id-doesnt-exist').text('new text') and wonder why it wasn't working. this "plugin" will do a console.warn with a message
[18:22:08] <mikeycgto> strictly for dev purposes of course
[18:22:13] <jtannenbaum> Eviltwin: my scripts? I'll try to paste it
[18:22:37] <Eviltwin> Are they <script...></script> in the HTML?
[18:23:05] <jtannenbaum> yes: http://paste.pound-python.org/show/9436/
[18:23:24] <greenail> i did a prototype with escaped json but it's kinda bulky
[18:24:01] <mythmon> greenail: have you seen Base64 encoding?
[18:24:03] <Eviltwin> jtannenbaum: What's in jquery.hoverIntent.js?
[18:24:09] <jtannenbaum> it's a plugin
[18:24:22] <mythmon> though I don't think that would be as compact as you would like.
[18:24:23] <jtannenbaum> should I paste it? I think it's short
[18:24:59] <Eviltwin> jtannenbaum: And jQuery or window.jQuery is still defined?
[18:25:07] <jtannenbaum> http://paste.pound-python.org/show/9437/ there's hoverIntent
[18:25:10] <jtannenbaum> I believe so
[18:25:19] <Eviltwin> mikeycgto: Have you used .call and .apply before?
[18:25:28] <Eviltwin> mikeycgto: And "arguments"
[18:25:33] <jtannenbaum> yes, both are define
[18:25:34] <greenail> mythmon, i'd like to keep it dynamic so i'm not sure how to figure out the max objects i can store in the url
[18:25:35] <jtannenbaum> d
[18:25:38] <Eviltwin> mikeycgto: Those will all be helpful for what you're trying to do
[18:26:02] <jtannenbaum> window.$ and $ are "undefined", they don't show a ReferenceError on the console but just say undefined
[18:26:26] <greenail> captainforever is a good example of a simular problem
[18:26:34] <Eviltwin> That's strange, almost feels like a with() sandbox
[18:26:53] <greenail> though he is mapping to a 2d grid, and i'm dealing with more of a tree
[18:27:06] <jtannenbaum> "undefined (variable) is a global property whose initial value is undefined (value), Since its a global property we can also access it as a variable."
[18:27:12] <jtannenbaum> - http://javascriptweblog.wordpress.com/2010/08/16/understanding-undefined-and-preventing-referenceerrors/
[18:27:19] <jtannenbaum> it seems that it's that.
[18:27:41] <mikeycgto> yeah i have
[18:28:21] <Eviltwin> jtannenbaum: Are you using jQuery and Prototype or something?
[18:28:28] <jtannenbaum> no, just jQuery
[18:28:29] <mikeycgto> ive also looked into the relatively new jQuery.sub()
[18:28:47] <mikeycgto> but I want to "override" the existing $ and jQuery refs
[18:28:52] <mikeycgto> so its sort of seamless
[18:28:57] <mikeycgto> its strictly a dev tool though
[18:31:26] <Eviltwin> jtannenbaum: Do you have $ = jQuery; ?
[18:31:27] <jtannenbaum> I mean if anyone was really not-busy I could let them play with the live page
[18:31:38] <jtannenbaum> pretty sure yea
[18:31:39] <Eviltwin> jtannenbaum: Might help to take a peek
[18:31:52] <Eviltwin> Can you try "var $ = jQuery;"
[18:32:00] <Eviltwin> Instead
[18:32:35] <jtannenbaum> oh, it worked when I put $ = jQuery; inside the ready() function
[18:33:14] <fris> or just do jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
[18:33:42] <Eviltwin> I think it's working outside just fine
[18:33:47] <Eviltwin> If I understand correctly
[18:35:10] <jtannenbaum> fris's thing works too
[18:35:15] <Eviltwin> K
[18:35:22] <Eviltwin> Still not sure why that wasn't working in the first place
[18:35:28] <Eviltwin> Perhaps try leaving off $ = jQuery?
[18:35:41] <jtannenbaum> it's gone, replaced with fris's thing
[18:35:47] <Eviltwin> K
[18:36:09] <fris> jtannenbaum i take it this is for wordpress? i joined after youa sked your q
[18:36:16] <jtannenbaum> not at all
[18:36:25] <jtannenbaum> it's a django website on dotcloud

[18:54:33] <uf0> search_results.php?s=Frank+Sinatra
[18:54:45] <uf0> that works if I select via keyboard
[18:54:58] <uf0> but on mouse click it doesn't update the query
[18:55:09] <uf0> even though you can click on the autocomplete dropdown
[18:55:19] <uf0> mouse click results in
[18:55:22] <uf0> search_results.php?s=a
[18:55:32] <djQuery> uf0: are u using see ?ui.autocomplete
[18:55:33] <bot-t> uf0, The Autocomplete widgets provides suggestions while you type into the field. http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[18:55:34] <uf0> "a" being what I type in the search input text field
[18:55:47] <uf0> yes i am
[18:55:51] <uf0> i'm using it
[18:55:54] <uf0> and it works great
[18:56:05] <uf0> it just the mouse click doesn't update my search query
[18:56:14] <uf0> keyboard does though
[18:56:28] <uf0> not sure what i'm missing here.
[18:57:05] <uf0> djQuery: so yes i'm using jquery ui autocomplete widget
[18:57:06] <djQuery> uf0: then bind to the focus of the input to show the autocomplete. view the combox example for how to show the associated menu
[18:57:28] <KingDosser> Is there anyway to wait for a fadeIn to finish in a function that is being called before executing the next bit of code.
[18:57:31] <uf0> how do I bind it
[18:57:34] <uf0> rookie here btw
[18:57:35] <djQuery> they do it on a button click but u could jsut as easily do it on focus.
[18:57:36] <uf0> ?
[18:57:42] <djQuery> ?bind@uf0
[18:57:42] <bot-t> uf0, .bind(eventType, [eventData], handler): Attach a handler to an event for the elements. http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[18:57:53] <djQuery> ?jqf@uf0
[18:57:53] <bot-t> uf0, jQuery Fundamentals, an open-source jQuery Book -- http://jqfundamentals.com/book/
[18:58:14] <djQuery> KingDosser: ?fadein
[18:58:21] <djQuery> ?fadein
[18:58:22] <bot-t> .fadeIn([duration], [callback]): Display the matched elements by fading them to opaque. http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[18:58:44] <djQuery> KingDosser: notice that it accepts a function to call after the fad is complete
[18:58:51] <uf0> i think i may need rephrase
[18:58:58] <uf0> http://jsfiddle.net/xvVKW/115/
[18:59:04] <uf0> the code above works great as is
[18:59:20] <djQuery> 115 edits so you been working at it a bit
[18:59:31] <Mixmasterxp> Could someone help me with a nested object problem here? http://jsfiddle.net/VEwtV/
[18:59:33] <uf0> click and all works functionality wise
[18:59:37] <uf0> i'm specifically talking about
[18:59:50] <uf0> the click for whatever reason does update the value of the search input
[18:59:53] <uf0> like keyboard does
[18:59:59] <KingDosser> djQuery I know it does. But how do I know its finished if i am calling a function that exectutes it then i want to call another.
[19:00:23] <djQuery> then put the other in the callback
[19:00:36] <uf0> how do i do that?
[19:01:11] <djQuery> $('#mydiv').fadeIn('slow', fucntion(){  do oterh stuff here this is after the fade has finnished or even call a named funciton})
[19:01:18] <djQuery> KingDosser: ^^^
[19:02:13] <mystline> KingDosser: you can also replace the anonymous function in djQuerys example with a function call.
[19:12:07] <fructose> I'm trying to debug a $.ajax() call. It uses error: function(data) { alert(data.statusText); }. Is that wrong? Firebug tells me "data is not defined"
[19:13:37] <kborchers> ?ajax @ fructose
[19:13:37] <bot-t> fructose, jQuery.ajax(settings): Perform an asynchronous HTTP (Ajax) request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[19:14:05] <kborchers> fructose: see this part - error(jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown)
[19:14:50] <Hail_Spacecake> does jquery support calling .bind or .one or what have you on the document itself?
[19:15:11] <kborchers> Hail_Spacecake: yes, you can bind to document
[19:15:42] <Hail_Spacecake> so, #("document").bind("keydown", function) should capture any keypress at all on the page?
[19:16:54] <kborchers> Hail_Spacecake: actually i think you want $(document) without the quotes ... i think.
[19:51:59] <pizza_> i'd like to clone a document from one frame into another. is this possible?
[19:58:41] <Eviltwin> pizza_: I don't believe you can access child frames

[20:56:15] <gurumelo> Good night, which differences are there between mouseover() and mouseenter() ? thanks
[20:56:22] <m0dmd> good day everyone.

[21:33:41] <heshanh> is there a way to add a property to a table using jquery. i have a table and the cellpadding/spacing isnt defined. i want to set both to 0
[21:34:00] <snover> heshanh: do it in your css.
[21:34:30] <snover> th, td { padding: 0; border-spacing: 0; }
[21:34:45] <heshanh> oh i didnt know thats what it was called. ty :)
[21:43:30] <christopherbull> I"m trying to get uploadify working on a standard file upload form but it's not rendering.  It's also not showing any errors, this is within the yii php framework, does anyone have any ideas?
[21:51:29] <heshanh> really silly question, what is the best way to check if an class is somewhere in the page?
[21:51:44] <heshanh> i have a mod_menu class and i wana see if its anywhere on the page
[21:53:55] <heshanh> nvm figured it out :D
[21:56:31] <endy_c> I have a bunch of links from $("a.reports"), how do I convert this into an array of link descriptions?
[21:57:20] <endy_c> example: <a href="..." class="reports">sales</a> becomes ["sales"]
[22:00:31] <christopherbull> would still love some uploadify hlep
[22:01:24] <heshanh> ive done it in CI
[22:01:33] <heshanh> not sure what the go is in yii
[22:02:22] <heshanh> cant you wrap the whole thing ina try and echo out the errors? i dont think it shows errors like that
[22:07:26] <christopherbull> it may be bigger than that actually, no jquery trageting works...i tried to hide an element and it's done nothing
[22:10:03] <heshanh> is jq working at all?
[22:16:28] <christopherbull> doesn't seem to be
[22:16:38] <christopherbull> tried to hide the same element and it didn't do anything
[22:16:40] <ussher_> has anyone used jeditable()?  Im trying to call the "cancel" callback directly but am not having much luck.  The function is supposed to cancel automatically 'onblur' but the time plugin seams to over-ride that functionality.  How could i call the cancel function directly?
[22:16:46] <christopherbull> but js is
[22:16:49] <christopherbull> i can alert stuff

[22:19:05] <christopherbull> yeah, i'm trying to debug it, but it's not throwing any errors, it's just not doing anything
[22:21:59] <heshanh> wha do u get if u do $ on the console?
[22:22:04] <heshanh> or jQuery
[22:23:06] <christopherbull> function ( selector, context ) {// The jQuery object is actually just the init constructor 'enhanced' return new jQuery.fn.init( selector, context );}

[22:23:42] <cereallarceny> howdy
[22:24:23] <christopherbull> http://pastebin.com/E1VKrBRi this is the code in my yii template
[22:25:26] <heshanh> do u get anything if u do $('#uploadifyFileUpload') on the console?
[22:26:09] <christopherbull> get the element <input id=​"uploadifyFileUpload" name=​"AddOfferForm[image]​" type=​"file">​
[22:26:10] <christopherbull> ]
[22:27:56] <heshanh> there is a page that gets called if u can echo the outpout u can have look at the errors, i remember doing something smiller
[22:32:20] <christopherbull> ok it's a loading order thing
[22:32:28] <ussher_> wookiehangover:  thanks for that link, the firerainbow plugin looks cool.
[22:33:14] <wookiehangover> ussher_: sure
[22:34:38] <christopherbull> how do i make this script wait?
[22:35:40] <heshanh> where do u want it to wait?
[22:35:51] <dytrivedi> .seen theCode
[22:35:51] <hsbot> theCode was seen 1 minute and 32 seconds ago, quitting with the message: Quit: in the beginning was the code
[22:36:43] <christopherbull> if it's not throwing undefined errors, could it still be executing the inline code before the libraries are loaded

[22:39:30] <justicefries> why is jquery not pluralized like the javascripts.
[22:39:33] <justicefries> the jqueries
[22:39:43] <christopherbull> this is really weird, if i wait till the page has fully loaded, i can run what i'm wanting to in the console, but it doesn't load at render time
[22:40:22] <wookiehangover> so you need to wait until your scripts and junk are loaded
[22:40:34] <wookiehangover> ?mdc document ready
[22:40:38] <bot-t> wookiehangover, document.readyState - MDN Docs - Returns "loading" while the document is loading, and "complete" once it has loaded. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/document.readyState
[22:40:52] <wookiehangover> ignore that
[22:41:57] <christopherbull> shouldn't $.ready do that?
[22:42:25] <wookiehangover> I was trying to find more generic documentation
[22:42:26] <wookiehangover> http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works
[22:42:44] <heshanh> what else is uploadify loading
[22:42:44] <wookiehangover> but bot-t gave me NOTHING
[22:43:21] <wookiehangover> ?g jquery file upload
[22:43:22] <bot-t> wookiehangover, jQuery File Upload Demo - http://aquantum-demo.appspot.com/file-upload
[22:43:27] <wookiehangover> ^ most recommended
[22:45:26] <christopherbull> thanks, the weird thing is, other js code, outside jq in the script tag runs, just not the jquery
[22:46:00] <danbell> dumb question---can I put ALL my jquery code, function definitions included, in the callback of $(document).ready()?
[22:46:22] <wookiehangover> yes
[22:46:24] <heshanh> do an alert on dom ready see if it pops
[22:46:41] <christopherbull> $.ready?
[22:46:49] <wookiehangover> ? ready
[22:46:50] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[22:47:07] <christopherbull> yeah, tried that, none of my jQuery is running
[22:47:10] <wookiehangover> i'mma let you read that 1 more time
[22:47:23] <heshanh> $(function() { alert("LOOOADED"; }) ;
[22:48:56] <christopherbull> heshanh: doesn't throw anything
[22:49:09] <wookiehangover> ?p
[22:49:09] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[22:49:17] <heshanh> fiddle it
[22:49:20] <heshanh> or wat he said
[22:50:27] <heshanh> i get the feeling ur JQ is not beeing included properly
[22:51:24] <christopherbull> http://jsfiddle.net/YbWH9/
[22:51:43] <christopherbull> yeah, well it is, i can run it in console and everything works after pageload
[22:52:37] <wookiehangover> what does your html look like
[22:55:34] <christopherbull> updated the fiddle
[23:19:32] <bloodbought> Anyone mind looking at http://beta.mobilityhosting.com/services/ and helping me figure why a line is breaking when using .slideToggle() on the first "Learn More..." link?
[23:33:57] <ussher_> bloodbought: because its displaying as a block.  set the margin to 0 and the break will go away
[23:49:25] <ussher_> could someone take a look at this and show me how to make only one of the time blocks open at a time: http://jsfiddle.net/kb2n5/  clicking on the start or end times brings up a selector.  but when i click on another selection, i want the first selection to close.  Only one selector open at a time.
