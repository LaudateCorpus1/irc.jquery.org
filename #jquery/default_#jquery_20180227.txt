[01:27:00] <Cork> jayjo_: $() isn't dynamic, when you run $() it generates a list, and (i guess you're using .css) then loops that list and adds the styles to those elements
[01:27:21] <Cork> jayjo_: if you want state dependent styling you need to use stylesheets
[05:09:15] <sunslid> hi guys, I'm trying to select all $("tr.entry") in a DataTable but I'm only getting the visible ones that aren't pagianted
[05:09:23] <sunslid> how can I select all rows?
[05:09:45] <localh0st> sunslid: read docs
[05:10:23] <localh0st> sunslid: https://datatables.net/reference/api/rows().data()
[05:37:14] <sunslid> localh0st: I got it using row.nodes()! thank you
[05:40:47] <dimi1947> tell me pls, is this code OK from a syntax point of view:https://hastebin.com/jekezihuse.js
[05:40:55] <n4mu> Hello, I hope my question isn'
[05:41:00] <n4mu> Hello, I hope my question isn't too noobish:
[05:42:45] <n4mu> I've managed to integrate Jquery-UI with datepicker, autocomplete and accordion. The thing is, when I don't use any of the jquery-ui.css files my accordion looks perfect, but the datepicker and autocomplete are far from okay.
[05:43:28] <n4mu> Using the jquery-ui.css, or even jquery-ui-min.css ruins the accordion by applying too much Jquery default styling (colours, background and h3).
[05:44:11] <n4mu> Is there something I am missing ? Is it possible to have CSS for autocomplete that doesn't interfere with accordion ?
[05:50:11] <andywww> hi, I’m pulling jquery in on a bookmarklet, then trying to use it in another script which I am fetching with getScript:
[05:50:13] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/4975873abd80ecee9b4e9d1697b20cbd
[05:51:11] <andywww> K is recognised in the scope of the function of 13 but I’m curious how I can continue to use the ‘K’ in the script it pulls in?
[05:51:20] <andywww> at the minute it is undefined
[05:59:22] <dimi1947> nevermind...I found the solution
[05:59:30] <Cork> andywww: umm, line 12 will break the original site if it has jquery...
[05:59:39] <Cork> as it will release the $ variable
[05:59:59] <andywww> yeah do i need to create a window.K?
[06:00:12] <Cork> i would do something like init(false)
[06:00:26] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/09a613422e78b713d9986ebc31d6c859
[06:00:47] <Cork> and function(injecting) { if(injecting === false) { $.noConflict(); } }
[06:01:04] <Cork> that will still break the original site
[06:01:16] <Cork> you don't want to touch $ unless you load jquery
[06:01:41] <Cork> opps
[06:01:48] <Cork> * and function(injecting) { if(injecting !== false) { $.noConflict(); } }
[06:01:49] <andywww> would you mind refactoring that snippet so i can understand how it should be done?
[06:02:14] <Cork> andywww: just send something from line 8 to signal that you're not injecting jquery
[06:02:30] <andywww> okay one sec
[06:05:09] <andywww> where would assigning K sit in that solution, then?
[06:05:11] <andywww> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6f5233a3b427ba6fd86c20a3fe4fe710
[06:09:39] <andywww> i would like to use the version i pull in regardless of wether they have a version loaded or not
[06:14:25] <n4mu> (I think I may have found my solution, keep Jquery datepicker, do the accordion with CSS. Cheers)
[06:20:29] <andywww> not the best place to leave it, really...
[06:41:24] <dan_j> Hi. I've created a PIN number entry screen using html and css. The buttons are connected to jquery events. But fairly often, the event fails to trigger, making it not as responsive as it should be.
[06:41:28] <dan_j> https://www.dropbox.com/s/cbgp1zk8b5htx3o/pin_entry.png?dl=0
[06:41:49] <dan_j> What could be causing this?
[06:42:27] <dan_j> It's mainly when using touchscreen. My current theory is that the browser keeps trying to copy the text rather than trigger the event.
[06:54:54] <localh0st> dan_j: cool, but sharing the code would be more helpful
[07:14:48] <Cork> ya, debugging why something fails through a screenshot isn't going to be someone here is going to spend time on i can tell you that
[08:31:25] <dan_j> It's quite hard to send the code as its part of a large project. But I can see the same problem using this https://codepen.io/simonja2/pen/QbGYbR
[08:31:49] <dan_j> When pressing numbers using my touchscreen, if i do it fast, some presses are not triggered
[08:32:15] <dan_j> IE if I press 7,8,7,8,7,8,7,8, fast, only the 8 is processed
[08:34:45] <dan_j> If I change .on('click touch') to .on('click touchstart') then it does fire every time, but it fires twice, the 2nd firing is on release
[08:34:52] <dan_j> which i assume is the click
[08:38:20] <dan_j> What are your thoughts on this? https://github.com/ftlabs/fastclick
[08:43:46] <Cork> dan_j: a start might be to use <button type="button"> instead of divs
[08:43:59] <rapha> hi!
[08:44:09] <dan_j> I thought that too. Just done it but it didn't make a difference.
[08:44:09] <Cork> alternatively you can set user-select: none; though that doesn't work in ie
[08:44:35] <dan_j> This is only used on a android tablets, so ie is not a problem. I'll give it a go.
[08:44:35] <Cork> what you get problem with is cause of text selection so you need a way to get around that
[08:44:44] <rapha> in https://gist.github.com/sixtyfive/2d52d13340ecc60985a1572f8b01107d , line 35 , is there a way to use something like .getJSON() after all? or was i right a year ago when i wrote that comment, and it's just not possible?
[08:45:32] <Cork> rapha: => ##javascript
[08:46:34] <rapha> Cork: but I want to use .getJSON() ... that's a jQuery function, is it not?
[08:47:14] <Cork> rapha: you're not using getJSON
[08:47:55] <Cork> if you have a question that is jquery related ask it
[08:48:04] <dan_j> Cork: Thanks, but button doesn't seem to help. I'm going to try to get the javascript to use 'click' on a desktop and 'touchstart' on a tablet.
[08:49:24] <rapha> Cork: I want to use getJSON instead of that funny looking loadJSON function there. How can I use getJSON here?
[08:51:03] <Cork> rapha: $.get(url).done(function(data) { win = editor.windowManager.open({ ... value: data ... }) })
[08:51:27] <Cork> rapha: sync ajax is deprecated in jquery AND in the webstandard
[08:51:59] <rapha> Cork: that deprecation is why I want to get rid of it. Let me try to understand the code you just gave me...
[08:52:16] <Cork> rapha: modern js uses callbacks instead of return values
[08:54:04] <Cork> rapha: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest/Synchronous_and_Asynchronous_Requests#Synchronous_request
[08:54:22] <Cork> that note is the reasons it has been deprecated all over the place
[08:55:53] <dan_j> touchstart works perfectly, but then it breaks PCs that have touchscreen and prevents them from using the mouse.
[08:56:33] * rapha reads
[08:58:33] <rapha> Cork: okay, that reasoning makes a lot of sense. I've modified the code and it looks like this now: https://gist.github.com/sixtyfive/2d52d13340ecc60985a1572f8b01107d ... unfortunately it doesn't run, saying that "win is undefined" ... so once I'm inside the .get() I'm in a different scope? How to work around that and still get "win" to be "ed" (as per line 4)?
[08:59:29] <Cork> rapha: ya, everything using "win" after that code needs to be inside the .done callback
[08:59:36] <Cork> else it will be undefined
[08:59:49] <Cork> (as it will run before it has been set to anything)
[09:04:04] <rapha> Cork: the problem with that is, even when I add "win, editor = ed;" after line 9, that doesn't change that "win is undefined". So it appears even "ed" is out of scope inside .done(). And it all depends on having access to "ed". That's what makes me so helpless about the whole effort to convert this thing to async :(
[09:04:17] <jozefk> anybody has an idea how can I get this animation restarting on each slide? https://codepen.io/jozefk/pen/oEQQbq
[09:04:24] <Cork> rapha: you misunderstood
[09:04:36] <Cork> rapha: you don't need to move the definition, you need to move the USE
[09:05:13] <Cork> rapha: var win; $.get().done(function(data) { win = ... }); win.something()
[09:05:36] <Cork> will run as var win; $.get() win.something(); .done(function(data) { win = ... })
[09:05:46] * rapha tries again
[09:06:01] <Cork> rapha: so win.something() has to move into .done
[09:51:05] <dimi1947> how I could check if an input contains a data attribute?
[09:53:00] <Cork> dimi1947: data- isn't a groping so that isn't super easy
[09:53:52] <dimi1947> Cork:I do not understand what are you trying to say
[09:54:14] <Cork> dimi1947: its data-something not data: { something="" }
[09:54:35] <Cork> so you will have to check if the different data-<what you use> exists
[09:55:05] <dimi1947> Cork:yes I agrre....how I can perform some check...in this case is data-service
[09:55:14] <dimi1947> such chack
[09:55:18] <Cork> $('[data-service]')
[09:55:42] <dimi1947> that looks incomplete
[09:56:00] <Cork> $('[data-service]') is the short form of $('*[data-service]')
[09:56:16] <Cork> but no it isn't incomplete
[09:56:49] <dimi1947> I still I do not understand how to make the check
[09:58:27] <dimi1947> how this code above can help?
[09:58:29] <Cork> well, if you just want to on an input event or something just do $(this).is('[data-service]')
[09:58:40] <Cork> the code is for selecting those elements
[09:58:45] <Cork> so it depends on what you need to do
[09:58:56] <Cork> another option is to just check for it $(this).data('service')
[09:59:08] <Cork> it all depends on what you need to do
[09:59:14] <dimi1947> than is its better to prepare a fiddle to see better
[10:03:13] <dimi1947> take a look at this fiddle:https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/5a7dpa8j/   I want to check if the last input(from these two) has a data attribute in it
[10:03:57] <Cork> you mean the yes no?
[10:04:21] <Cork> also you're missing the code context
[10:04:47] <dimi1947> I mean the input box that it's placeholder says "service"
[10:05:15] <Cork> that's the first not the last
[10:05:33] <Cork> also when you want to check isn't in there and that is the context i was talking about
[10:05:53] <dimi1947> just a minute...
[10:06:26] <dimi1947> I am not talking about the input whose value is test...
[10:07:13] <dimi1947> I suppose this one is the first
[10:22:04] <rapha> Cork: I'm noticing that with .getJSON(url).done({function(data) {}); "data" is an "object" according to typeof. if you try to inspect it with console.log, though, that says it's an Array of Objects. in any case, nothing I try let's me add another element to it. Is there some documentation about this?
[10:28:39] <Cork> rapha: if $.getJSON().done() gives you an object but $.get().done() does not
[10:29:09] <Cork> it means that the server lies about what it sends and says it sends text (most likely text/html)
[10:29:30] <Cork> rapha: if possible i would recommend fixing the Content-Type in the server response
[10:29:39] <Cork> (from text/html to application/json)
[10:29:42] <rapha> Cork: with .get() I get a string, which is not parsed as JSON. with .getJSON() it's parsed as JSON. That's what I expected.
[10:29:53] <Cork> ya, like i just said
[10:30:15] <Cork> $.get only parses the json if the server says it is sending json
[10:30:18] <rapha> I mean, I'm happy that it's JSON. My questions is about manipulating it.
[10:30:45] <rapha> The only thing that works on it is .slice(). But I can't find anything to append or prepend to it...
[10:30:52] <Cork> sigh
[10:31:00] <Cork> rapha: please read through the response i've given you
[10:32:12] <rapha> Cork: I understood that you said that if the server was declaring it as JSON then I wouldn't have to use .getJSON but could simply use .get. What I don't understand is how that would help me to append or prepend to the data as it already is JSON, it just arrived in a non-optimal way?
[10:33:01] <Cork> rapha: when you get a parsed object just work with the array/object you get
[10:33:17] <Cork> data[2].key[2] = 'new value';
[10:33:53] <rapha> Okay, I changed the server to declare it as JSON.
[10:33:56] <Cork> if the json was [{},{},{key:["","","old value"]}]
[10:34:21] <Cork> well [{},{},{"key":["","","old value"]}] actually
[10:34:52] <rapha> Cork: I don't want to change an already existing value. I want to e.g. prepend a whole new key/value pair.
[10:35:11] <Cork> rapha: you don't prepend
[10:35:16] <Cork> you set a key
[10:35:21] <Cork> or add an array value
[10:35:26] <Cork> its not a string
[10:36:01] <rapha> Now you have me completely confused
[10:37:12] <rapha> [0: "x", 1: "y", 2: "z"] ... some magical operation ... [0: "a", 1: "x", 2: "y", 3: "z"] ... now i've prepended something. that's how arrays always worked for me ...
[10:39:43] <rapha> Also, "TypeError: data[2].key is undefined"
[10:42:59] <rapha> What the ... ??? All of a sudden .unshift({blah: blah}) works again
[10:43:14] <rapha> Javascript has been invented for the sole purpose of confusing the heck out of me
[10:44:49] <Cork> rapha: https://jsfiddle.net/652199L6/6/
[10:50:10] <rapha> Cork: finally it's all working properly! https://gist.github.com/sixtyfive/2d52d13340ecc60985a1572f8b01107d

[17:33:11] <carl0s-> hey.. lets say my website uses plain html (with lots of js etc.). I use a nice CMS system for headers footers etc, and a bit of php for iterating over objects like staff members, job vacancies, blog posts etc. Well, would you bother going Ajax-y on the main content container? i.e so that header and footer stay where they are (albeit with .active being set on menu entry), and the main content section just changes? I have CSS transitions so it kind
[17:33:11] <carl0s->  of seems like I don't need it, but I'm trying to learn what's possible and try stuff out. Here's the site.. http://plpcrl.uk
[17:33:52] <carl0s-> would going ajaxy, apart from maybe being confusing for me to implement at first, would it offer a big speedup because I wouldn't be importing the stylesheets and external javascript files with each page change?
[17:34:42] <carl0s-> check out my /team page.. i'm well chuffed with the modal popup. uses a ResizeSensor to size the popup text div to be the same height as the auto-sizing / shrinking image
[17:56:50] <taplar> is each section that you are loading dynamic in any way carl0s- ?
[18:17:25] <carl0s-> taplar, hi. err, no not really. I'm just wondering if it's a big waste because the js/css is being pulled in with each page change. I wasn't sure if OctoberCMS was supposed to be dealing with that automatically but I don't think it does
[18:20:44] <taplar> well, from a load standpoint, if you don't pull in the subsection until the user goes to them, your initial load time would decrease
[18:21:08] <taplar> also if the sections are static, then repeated ajax calls to get them would get them from cache, provided you allowed it to cache
[18:21:12] <taplar> so there are some benefits
[18:22:13] <carl0s-> hmm i'll give it some thought then. The CMS system has ajax facilities built in, but they appear to be mostly for parts of pages e.g. form content etc, rather than entire pages (minus header and footer).
[18:47:31] <hillct> Good afternoon all. Can someone give me an idea why my TD click eent handler isn’t behaving as .live used to and binding to any newly creared TD items? The handler is currently setup thusly: $("#sample5 tbody tr td").on('click',function(e){ / Stuff here / }
[18:47:31] <hillct> Oh, it’s worth pointing out this is using jQuery 3.1
[18:47:55] <taplar> that's not a delegate binding
[18:48:11] <taplar> the new syntax is $(parentSelector).on(event, childSelector, eventHandler)
[18:48:35] <taplar> the on() api page will also reflect that
[18:48:48] <hillct> taplar: I thought all bindings defaulted to delegate bindings as of jquery 1.7. What’s the correct format? (or documentation link :) )
[18:49:00] <hillct> oh
[18:49:15] <taplar> on() without the child selector is a non-delegate binding
[18:49:22] <hillct> I had referredto the .on() doc page and didn’t get that meaning
[18:49:28] <taplar> :)
[18:49:29] <hillct> I’ll try that construction. Thanks
