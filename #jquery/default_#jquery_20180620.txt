[00:00:10] <pavonia> Well, that's different behaviour from your second link. You'd never enable a checkbox again with this
[00:01:17] <Johne> yasar[m], first fiddle was more of what zibwas working with
[00:01:40] <Johne> whoops
[00:01:46] <Johne> yeah*
[00:01:57] <Johne> sorry yasar
[00:04:49] <Johne> is my .each fubar'd?
[05:59:50] <soahccc> position() on a <li> should give me the relative "offset" to it's <ul> no?
[06:00:47] <Cork> only if the ul is positioned
[06:01:05] <Cork> (witch it normally isn't)
[06:01:15] <soahccc> Hmm what do you mean by positioned exactly?
[06:01:40] <Cork> position not static
[06:02:00] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position
[06:02:50] <Cork> what you most likely want is to grab both the ul and the li and subtract the ul from the li
[06:03:24] <soahccc> so the ul is position relative but maybe I should just say what I'm trying to do: keep the li centered (by scrolling the ul)
[06:04:03] <Cork> soahccc: try making a jsfiddle showing what you're trying to do
[06:07:50] <soahccc> Well I mean scrollIntoView works but it only can do top/bottom. using ul.scrollTo(y: li.position().top) works every second time for some reason (I'm just trying to keep it at the top, basically emulating scrollIntoView)
[06:10:43] <soahccc> Like one time the first entry has position.y = 0 (makes sense) and the next time it's -438 :S Maybe it's broken because the parent is position: fixed
[06:15:11] <soahccc> Okay maybe I just don't understand what (jquery's) position() is supposed to do but li.get(0).offsetTop works for me
[06:37:16] <Paradisee> hello o/
[06:37:36] <Paradisee> im getting an error on this simple code: http://dpaste.com/0FZ2TF2
[06:37:45] <Paradisee> SyntaxError: unexpected token: ':'
[06:38:58] <preference> what does the error say?
[06:39:27] <Paradisee> what i already wrote.
[06:39:34] <preference> i'm asking you what it means
[06:39:48] <Paradisee> looks like it doesn't want ':'
[06:39:54] <preference> correct
[06:40:05] <Paradisee> doesn't make sense for me.
[06:41:39] <Paradisee> i can't see the error.
[06:47:15] <Paradisee> i tried to remove function() and seems to work...
[06:47:19] <Paradisee> is that the problem?
[06:50:51] <pavonia> If you say "function () ..." but put an object after it
[06:51:22] <pavonia> -If
[06:53:11] <Paradisee> $.ajax is not a function
[06:53:17] <Paradisee> that's what i get now.
[06:53:34] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/1RRTVB9
[06:54:51] <pavonia> Is that comma on line 19 allowed?
[06:55:06] <Cork> yes
[06:55:13] <Cork> except in ie < 10
[06:55:35] <Paradisee> not using ie.
[06:55:42] <Cork> what is the error?
[06:55:50] <Paradisee> $.ajax is not a function
[06:55:54] <Paradisee> that's it.
[06:56:02] <Cork> so you've missed to load jquery
[06:56:07] <Paradisee> when i type a character in the input.
[06:56:14] <Paradisee> jquery is loaded.
[06:56:29] <Cork> try jQuery.ajax
[06:57:07] <Paradisee> same.
[06:57:15] <Cork> then you don't have jqeury loaded
[06:57:23] <Cork> you have something else that is similar but not jqeury
[06:57:26] <Cork> *jquery
[06:57:49] <Paradisee> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
[06:57:54] <Paradisee> it says it is loaded.-
[06:58:24] <Cork> .slim doesn't have ajax
[06:58:39] <Paradisee> cool.
[06:58:43] <Paradisee> which one should i use then
[06:58:57] <Cork> the standard lib
[06:59:23] <Paradisee> You can also use the slim build, which excludes the ajax and effects modules:
[06:59:27] <Cork> <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
[07:01:46] <Paradisee> ok, thanks.
[07:21:43] <xcm> hello. i have a type="submit" in a form. upon submitting, i disable the button and change its value like so: https://bpaste.net/show/5e633a1ef236 . unfortunately, this makes it so that its name ("myname") is not submitted. i wonder why this happens and what i can do about it
[07:23:24] <Cork> xcm: disabled form fields aren't submitted
[07:43:06] <xcm> well this one is. my backend code is executed
[07:44:00] <xcm> mind you it is enabled at the time when submit fires
[07:49:06] <Cork> ya like i said, disabled form elements aren't submitted
[07:52:03] <Duikb00t> Good refactor? https://kopy.io/O2lPY
[07:53:42] <Cork> Duikb00t: remove the ' between the classes
[07:55:29] <Duikb00t> $('.field_name , .field_street , .field_no , .field_city , .field_zip , .field_phone').val('');
[07:56:10] <preference> Cork: are hidden form elements submitted?
[07:56:15] <Cork> yes
[07:56:28] <Cork> only disabled affects it
[07:58:43] <Duikb00t> Hmz thinking, my address fields are conditional based on an other field.
[07:58:59] <Duikb00t> When you enter field_1 correctly the address fields show up.
[07:59:16] <Duikb00t> But when you make a change on that field while there was data rendered previously... I remove it again
[07:59:23] <Duikb00t> An invalid form control with name='registration[details][zip]' is not focusable.  but then yeah this error occurs,
[07:59:32] <Duikb00t> Because I clear the data and hide the div where the form elements are on.
[07:59:43] <Duikb00t> Is there a way to prevent this error?
[08:01:43] <xcm> Cork: oh. i should had read that a little more carefully. thanks!
[08:02:13] <Johne> https://jsfiddle.net/tk1qawsg/10/ my fiddle is ignoring the part about two values being equal, line 24. any ideas?
[08:04:30] <Cork> Johne: you're missing $() and none $() a lot
[08:04:48] <Cork> this doens't have prop and checkboxes doesn't exist $checkboxes does though (and doesn't need $())
[08:08:19] <Cork> Johne: https://jsfiddle.net/tk1qawsg/16/
[08:11:16] <Johne> ah I see now, now I just have to switch things around
[08:11:58] <Johne> that's what I get for being half asleep
[08:14:14] <Johne> so this was my desired result https://jsfiddle.net/tk1qawsg/20/
[08:14:31] <Johne> ty for your second set of eyes
[11:05:49] <tdelam> I have a <select id="example1"> and generating options dynamically via the DB. When the user selects an option, I want to change the id of the select to be <select id="example2"> and have access to $("#example2").change(() => { console.log("event fired!"); }); but the change event for example2 never gets fired. Any suggestions?
[11:07:10] <pavonia> Why do you want to change the ID?
[11:09:09] <tdelam> building a wizard kind of dropdown with 3 steps. The ID change does some other things but mainly want to get a change() event on it so I can grab some other data.
[11:10:22] <tdelam> basically step 1. select something, step 2. data is loaded based on step 1, step 3. other data loaded based on step 1 and 2. They all use the same dropdown and options in the select replaces for each step
[11:10:28] <neo4> pavonia: ;)
[11:11:45] <pavonia> You can only register the change after the ID has already changed, I think
[11:12:42] <pavonia> What you could do is adding a delegated event on the container of the <select> that matches on "[id^=example]"
[11:15:12] <tdelam> $('#example2').trigger('change')?
[11:15:58] <pavonia> That only triggers if that element does already exist when the handler is installed
[11:16:34] <pavonia> I mean the element with that exact ID
[11:21:34] <tdelam> hmm, I think I follow. I'll have a look
[16:13:26] <pdub> Howdy folks
[16:15:15] <robertmaxrees> hello
[16:15:39] <pdub> I am facing a bit of a problem with a simple 'compare password' login route using bcrypt.  Problem 1: Upon login, I hash the attempted password. However, after hashing, it's not the same as what is in the database (despite being the same exact password, and using same hashing function).  Problem 2: the route's function chain fires before the async functions that the chain uses, resulting in an out of order async chain.   Here
[16:15:39] <pdub>  you'll find: Problem outlined, The simple login route, two basic function definitions (hash password, and lookup user to compare passwords), and terminal output -- https://pastebin.com/XYkS3VCp
[16:16:19] <pdub> Clearly I am missing something, I think it has to due to async flow of the functions which are called.
[16:16:28] <robertmaxrees> looks like this is all node?
[16:17:54] <pdub> yes sir
[16:18:02] <pdub> OH
[16:18:03] <pdub> sorry guys
[16:18:37] <robertmaxrees> :)

[19:34:08] <Al_nz1> I need to keep change the background color of the collapsible item if any of the tick boxes are checked or if the Comments box contains text...anyone able to assist? http://jsfiddle.net/x1hphsvb/5564/
[19:46:59] <robertmaxrtees> huh?
[20:07:35] <Al_nz> robertmaxrtees: if any information is entered into the collapsable section - then change the background color of the collapsable title to indicate it has data in it?
[22:52:14] <SideFX> I have a page where I have a function running off a class, which works, but when I click to make ajax pull up a different page, and then the initial page again the function no longer works
[23:01:00] <SideFX> Figured it out, I can just put the code after the ajax call to re-listen
