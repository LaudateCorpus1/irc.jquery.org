[00:06:51] <sassyapril> how do i start resolving the bugs ?
[00:07:12] <sassyapril> looking at report http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/14483
[00:11:42] <interop_madness> i am facing a bug where a certain ajax request is aborted. i have no idea why it occurs. it happens only every now and then and the ajax request is nothing out of the ordinary. i spent a day looking for the reason. educated guesses welcome.
[00:26:26] <fabioportieri> o/
[00:33:21] <GreatPotato> A saw a jQuery plugin recently, that when you make your screen smaller, it replaces navigation items that do not fit in the menu with "More >" any body know what it is called or where it can be found?
[00:33:55] <jphase> GreatPotato: that can be done entirely with CSS - but there are some jquery plugins out there as well sure
[00:34:11] <GreatPotato> How can that be done with CSS?
[00:34:12] <anli_> When I use the google translate widget, the page comes up untranslated and translates when the widget has initialized, thats annoying :)
[00:34:20] <GreatPotato> You can't calculate the widths of elements?
[00:34:26] <jphase> GreatPotato: "media queries"
[00:34:38] <GreatPotato> Yeh but still, you can't calculate element widths
[00:34:53] <fabioportieri> the best lightweight jquery tooltip?
[00:35:30] <jphase> you can calculate screen width, and if your element widths add up to <= a certain width it's a "break point"
[00:35:40] <GreatPotato> Basically the functionality of this menu: http://m.bbc.co.uk/sport/football
[00:35:41] <jphase> i.e. Foundation CSS does this
[00:35:54] <jphase> they also use JS here and there but mostly that's done with CSS
[00:36:07] <jphase> http://foundation.zurb.com/
[00:36:57] <GreatPotato> Yes i know how media queries work, but that menu doesn't have the functionality I'm describing
[00:37:04] <GreatPotato> See the link I posted above
[00:37:36] <sassyapril> what does the priority blocker means ?
[00:37:41] <jphase> 90% of the link you posted above is done with media queries
[00:37:49] <jphase> possibly 100%
[00:38:19] <GreatPotato> Nope its not, its done with javascript, to calculate the widths, if they're too big, it puts them in the "more" menu
[00:38:19] <jphase> nah, 90% - you must be talking about the white bar?
[00:38:25] <GreatPotato> Black bar
[00:38:42] <jphase> sure, that can be done with js
[00:38:53] <GreatPotato> Yes I'm aware of this
[00:38:56] <jphase> not sure there's like a "go-to" plugin for it though
[00:39:00] <GreatPotato> "A saw a jQuery plugin recently, that when you make your screen smaller, it replaces navigation items that do not fit in the menu with "More >" any body know what it is called or where it can be found?"
[00:39:29] <jphase> heh, no need to get all snippy, just saying that's mostly done with css
[00:40:30] <jphase> I would usually do that stuff all custom though
[00:42:05] <jphase> if there is a plugin that just happens to know you're working with a menu and you define a width and when it gets <= than that width it just starts negating elements off of it and does sorcery to make things fit I'm personally not aware of it
[00:42:26] <jphase> it'd be pretty easy to code though :)
[00:50:03] <jphase> GreatPotato: didn't know if you were savvy on media queries. if you are looking for help with something with js lemme know - I'd be happy to assist
[01:00:10] <fabioportieri> the ui tooltip seems cool enough
[01:01:24] <jphase> 's aiight
[01:01:46] <jphase> I usually use qtip unless jQuery UI is already included
[01:05:49] <wa5ted> grafi: you around
[01:14:48] <wa5ted> grafi: is Rohan_Bhangui i just changed my nick wanted to catch up with you
[01:50:43] <johonunu> Hi can someone help me with jquery ui sortable ? I can't seem to "refresh" the items.
[02:01:01] <mikecmpbll> i want a change event to fire when i change the checked status of a checkbox via jquery using prop(). how would I go about this?
[02:01:14] <mikecmpbll> i understand that jquery doesn't behave like this by default
[02:01:54] <thinced> use trigger
[02:03:18] <mikecmpbll> thinced: eugh, not enough coffee. thanks, worked like a charm.
[02:08:11] <wa5ted> johonunu: i can maybe spare about 20 min
[02:08:14] <wa5ted> what you got
[02:08:20] <wa5ted> fiddle

[02:29:23] <Cristen> Hi everyone, I
[02:30:45] <Cristen> I'm trying to find a <li> with a data-category like this $('#mydiv').find('[data-category='+category+']) but it returns an empty object. What am I missing ?
[02:30:47] <SillyTalker> the remote data autocomplete demo of jquery mobile does not work on my webserver, what could be teh cause please?
[02:31:33] <SillyTalker> couldn't get it to work with my own data then i noticed the demo does nto even work
[02:33:02] <_JamieD_> Hi, I'm having trouble with the query UI autocomplete widget. I'm trying to trigger the search using $(".something").autocomplete('search', '') with a empty value, which according to the documentation should popular the list with all values. However this is not working. If I enter an value as the second argument the list is populated with the search results.
[02:34:18] <fabioportieri> Cristen: try adding quotes before +category
[02:34:32] <Cristen> I tried it doesn't work :s
[02:34:43] <fabioportieri> find('[data-category="'+category+'"])
[02:34:50] <Cristen> category value is a string -> "FA"
[02:35:19] <Cristen> If I try to hard-code it in the console it works, but inside my code it doesn't I don't get it
[02:35:37] <fabioportieri> then it has to be a quote problem
[02:36:25] <_JamieD_> Cristen: or your category variable is not what you think it is, have you logged it to the console?
[02:36:29] <Cristen> $('#mydiv').find('li[data-category='+category+']')
[02:36:36] <Cristen> sure I've logged it
[02:36:41] <SillyTalker> no takers?
[02:36:46] <fabioportieri> $('#mydiv').find('li[data-category="'+category+'"]')
[02:36:51] <fabioportieri> try this
[02:37:41] <Cristen> I added the " it is still an empty selector :s
[02:38:55] <Cristen> I logged the data part, the console returns -> [data-category="EA"]
[02:39:14] <fabioportieri> maybe you need wildcards?
[02:39:45] <Cristen> I read about it in the docs I'll need to find how to use it inside
[02:45:58] <fabioportieri> Cristen: if you want more support make a testcase in jsfiddle or such
[02:46:14] <fabioportieri> you may end by solving it yourself while preparing your testcase
[02:46:24] <Cristen> thanks fabioportieri :)
[02:48:12] <fabioportieri> Cristen: you can use this too http://jsfiddle.net/c6Mdy/1/
[02:50:33] <SillyTalker> the remote data autocomplete demo of jquery mobile does not work on my webserver, what could be teh cause please?
[02:50:39] <SillyTalker> couldn't get it to work with my own data then i noticed the demo does nto even work
[02:50:55] <SillyTalker> help would be appreciated i'm pretty stuck on this
[02:51:43] <SillyTalker> this is the demo i'm talking about: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/listview-autocomplete-remote/
[02:53:39] <_JamieD_> This must be a bug http://jsfiddle.net/VXDWH/ does not show any results, if you change the last line so it's searching for "a" it works
[02:54:14] <_JamieD_> according to the documentation searching for an empty string should return all results
[02:55:35] <_JamieD_> doh! I missed the key info that minLength must be 0 for it to work
[03:01:31] <g4> does anyone know whats wrong here (expect 2. <sibl>), or suggest a better way to do it? $('sibl', "<sibl></sibl><sibl><foo>true</foo></sibl>").first().next("sibl foo:contains('true')")
[03:03:00] <Cork> g4: please create a none psudo example @ jsfiddle.net
[03:03:41] <Cork> g4: btw the next selector won't work
[03:04:00] <Cork> you don't have a foo sibling with the content of true and a parent of sibl
[03:04:13] <g4> ahh ok
[03:05:16] <Cork> g4: be very careful with contains selectors, those are very slow and has a lot of other weird effects too
[03:05:42] <Cork> i would normally recommend to never use it actually
[03:05:51] <g4> ok, thanks for warning. I will do it without pseudo
[03:29:17] <SillyTalker> is there a specific jquery mobile channel somewhere?
[03:36:03] <Testcasefailure> got a question .. i have a nested structure of elements that repeat for X levels.. and i want to get only inputs of the level that i am currently selecting by class.. so i do :inputs, and use :not() to exclude it taking inputs from deeper levels.. now my code isn't working.. because even though i select a context which jquery should use as a base where it starts matching selectors.. the :not() still matches the wrapper that 
[03:36:20] <Testcasefailure> so it excludes elements from the level i'm in as well
[03:36:25] <Testcasefailure> here is the test case
[03:36:26] <Testcasefailure> http://jsfiddle.net/cfrsq/
[03:37:54] <elfenixtorres> Is it normal that when you load a form over $.ajax and put it into a wrapper using $(wrapper).html(formcontents) that the form doesn't work?
[03:38:16] <Cork> Testcasefailure: http://jsfiddle.net/cfrsq/1/
[03:38:42] <Cork> elfenixtorres: deoends on what you mean by "doesn't work"
[03:39:14] <Testcasefailure> shit.. that was easy
[03:39:18] <Testcasefailure> thanks cork
[03:39:19] <Testcasefailure> <3
[03:39:31] <Cork> :)
[03:39:33] <Cork> np
[03:39:36] <elfenixtorres> Cork, clicking the submit button, radio buttons or even checkboxes doesn't work. It's as if the click event is prevented. But I don't prevent click events in my code
[03:39:54] <Cork> elfenixtorres: and what should happen when those buttons are clicked?
[03:40:01] <Cork> standard http post?
[03:40:03] <Cork> ajax?
[03:40:08] <Cork> trip to the moon?
[03:40:35] <elfenixtorres> Cork, well, anything the normal functionality of a form should do. Checkboxes should be checked, radio buttons enabled, and the submit button submitted
[03:40:59] <Cork> is it standard checkboxes?
[03:41:07] <elfenixtorres> Cork, yup it is
[03:41:15] <Cork> then it should work just fine
[03:41:21] <Cork> the checkboxes at least
[03:41:26] <elfenixtorres> Cork, exactly, that's what I thought as well, very strange issue
[03:41:28] <Cork> the submit button depends on how you submit
[03:41:38] <Cork> elfenixtorres: check so nothing is covering the element
[03:41:46] <elfenixtorres> almost as if there's an e.preventDefault() in there or similar
[03:42:03] <Cork> most likely not
[03:42:07] <Cork> but hard to say
[03:42:12] <elfenixtorres> Cork, I can see the element being selected in the html by the dotted line around it
[03:42:25] <Cork> try reproduce it in jsfiddle
[03:42:40] <elfenixtorres> Cork, allright, thanks
[03:44:08] <Testcasefailure> Cork.. what if the input can be wrapped in an element, or more elements, which i do not know class/id/etc of... would it be possible to traverse multiple levels to find inputs, but ignore anything that is in the .dataTables_wrapper and below
[03:44:09] <Testcasefailure> ?
[03:45:25] <Cork> eh...
[03:45:46] <Cork> ok, let take this from the start
[03:45:58] <Cork> when you do selectors the work from the element you target
[03:46:29] <Cork> so :input:not(.dataTables_wrapper :input) first finds all input and selects
[03:46:48] <Cork> and then excludes all that has a parent or grand parent with the class dataTables_wrapper
[03:47:14] <Testcasefailure> ya
[03:47:17] <Testcasefailure> i get this
[03:47:17] <Cork> best solution is prob to break the nesting
[03:47:29] <Cork> so you don't nest them in the same parent
[03:47:33] <Testcasefailure> http://jsfiddle.net/cfrsq/2/
[03:47:40] <Testcasefailure> i can't
[03:48:38] <Testcasefailure> i can't break the nesting by moving it to another parent
[03:48:52] <Cork> is this good enough? http://jsfiddle.net/cfrsq/3/
[03:49:38] <Testcasefailure> hm lemme see
[03:50:32] <Testcasefailure> i think it should work this way
[03:50:56] <Testcasefailure> great! thank you again
[04:04:51] <enzo> I'd like to select all <a> that are into a top <div>, but <a> may not be a direct child of this <div>, so $("#mydiv a ") will find all <a> into the div at any depth?
[04:05:41] <Cork> $('#mydiv > * > a')
[04:05:45] <Cork> opps
[04:05:47] <Cork> $('#mydiv > * a')
[04:06:22] <fabioportieri> why not #mydiv a ?
[04:06:34] <Cork> fabioportieri: see his restriction
[04:06:53] <Cork> $('#mydiv').children().find('a') might be more preferment though
[04:07:00] <fabioportieri> Cork: a may not be a direct child?
[04:07:19] <xec_> $('#mydiv * a') should work too
[04:07:26] <Cork> ya
[04:07:48] <enzo> indeed #mydiv a is working, I was confused with the .each() that doesn't loop on all those links $("#mydiv a").each(function () { console.log("...") }); should loop no?
[04:07:50] <Cork> not sure what the performance difference is between those three though
[04:07:51] <fabioportieri> #mydiv a works even if it's not a direct child
[04:08:04] <Cork> it should
[04:08:23] <Cork> fabioportieri: the rule was the opposite
[04:08:34] <Cork> select everything EXCEPT the direct children
[04:08:39] <fabioportieri> ahh
[04:08:46] <xec_> Cork: i'm going to bet $('#mydiv').children().find('a') is the best, performance-wise
[04:08:48] <fabioportieri> nevermind me then
[04:08:53] <Cork> ya, same here
[04:10:08] <xec_> enzo: that code you posted should loop through all <a> elements that are descendants of #mydiv
[04:11:02] <enzo> yes all works now, thanks
[04:12:57] <enzo> another question, I'm using bootstrap to show a modal, I'd like to put another html page in the latter. how can I do that ? I've been advised to fetch the content html into ajax and put it into the modal. And for all actions in the html code, then prevent default click to put a custom click in order to call again the html code in ajax, and put it back into the modal
[04:13:29] <enzo> any easier solution ? (I was using the Panel from dojo that does all that automatically)
[04:41:51] <enzo> I'd like to run jquery selector on a specific html code, and not current document, nay idea how to do?
[04:42:28] <fabioportieri> ?
[04:44:50] <Cork> enzo: you can't select on html
[04:44:58] <Cork> enzo: you can select on a domfragment though
[04:45:16] <Cork> $($.parseHTML(data)).find()
[04:45:31] <Cork> though it will give you dom elements not html
[04:47:31] <enzo> data = $.parseHTML(data) will create dom from html Cork?
[04:47:41] <Cork> yes
[04:47:54] <Cork> $() will too (and wrap it in jquery)
[04:48:07] <Cork> but some combinations can cause it to fail in newer versions of jquery
[04:48:20] <enzo> ok
[04:48:22] <Cork> so it is recommended to use $.parseHTML
[04:48:38] <Cork> $.parseHTML was added in 1.9
[04:48:49] <Cork> so you don't need it if you use an older version
[04:49:44] <enzo> and when I have data (dom), how can I select #foobar in it Cork?
[04:50:01] <Cork> $($.parseHTML(data)).find('foobar')
[04:50:03] <Cork> opps
[04:50:05] <Cork> $($.parseHTML(data)).find('#foobar')
[04:50:23] <Cork> $('selector') is a short hand for $(document).find('selector')
[04:51:30] <enzo> ah ok
[04:52:49] <enzo> However, I'm trying to do $(html).find("#vda-ajax-wrapper a").each(function (idx, tag) { console.log(tag); }); and I don't get any tag, however <a> are present in the html
[04:53:03] <enzo> html = $.parseHTML(html) is the previous line
[04:53:21] <Cork> enzo: hmm that should work
[04:54:51] <enzo> it seems to retun the <div> and not all <a>
[04:56:33] <enzo> well nevermind, I've deleted this useless div wrapper now, and it works, thanks Cork
[04:59:41] <Cork> enzo: is the div the outer most element in the fragment?
[05:00:07] <Cork> if yes, they just use "a" not the id
[05:00:58] <Cork> enzo: http://jsfiddle.net/bbrfN/1/
[05:17:11] <sabotender> hmm. it seems that I cannot use fadeIn() with objects that I have changed the opacity to 0 in CSS first
[05:17:21] <sabotender> of course, I may be doing something wrong
[05:20:14] <sabotender> fadeOut() works just fine
[05:20:47] <Cork> fadeIn should work
[05:20:58] <Cork> + too
[05:21:29] <sabotender> I changed the opacity to 0 in CSS, then I try to fade it back in, no worky
[05:22:31] <Cork> hmm true
[05:24:30] <sabotender> maybe fadeIn/Out() does not use opacity?
[05:25:28] <enzo> thanks Cork
[05:25:28] <Cork> it does
[05:26:58] <Cork> ah
[05:27:16] <Cork> sabotage: fadeIn sees the original opacity as the end
[05:27:39] <Cork> so you should use .hide() instead of setting opacity directly
[05:28:04] <sabotender> eh?
[05:28:12] <Cork> sabotage: alternatively you can just use animate
[05:28:43] <Cork> sabotage: http://jsfiddle.net/PjtxS/2/
[05:28:56] <sabotender> who is sabotage
[05:28:59] <sabotender> :-P
[05:29:04] <Cork> -_-'
[05:29:21] <Cork> there is just too many nicks here with very similar nicks...
[05:29:30] <grafi> Cork y you no tab correctly :P
[05:29:41] <enzo> arg, now I have an html code with no wrapping <div>, $(html).find("a") doesn't find all <a>, only the ones that are nested into a tag root
[05:29:42] <Cork> grafi: correctly?
[05:29:47] <grafi> tab tab
[05:29:50] <grafi> :P
[05:29:57] <Cork> enzo: use filter not find
[05:30:07] <Cork> grafi: and when it
[05:30:17] <Cork> *'s tab-tab-tab-tab-tab ?
[05:30:26] <grafi> tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab tab
[05:30:26] <Cork> oh sorry it was tab-tab-tab-tab ;P
[05:30:32] <grafi> sabo tab tab
[05:30:34] <grafi> xD
[05:30:40] <enzo> now it finds only <a> that are not nested in a tag root Cork
[05:31:05] <Cork> enzo: a tags can't be nested in a tags
[05:31:21] <Cork> but yes those are two separate things
[05:31:36] <Cork> enzo: you might want to have the wrapping div if you want to find them all
[05:31:36] <sabotender> Cork: I am worried that jquery won't hide the elements until after the page has loaded, which will cause a whole lot of elements to seemingly snap out of existence
[05:31:57] <Cork> sabotender: if you run it on domContentLoaded i will
[05:32:06] <sabotender> you will, huh
[05:32:18] <Cork> as in the DOM ContentLoaded event not the end of the page
[05:33:08] <enzo> ok Cork
[05:33:31] <sabotender> so I hide all that stuff out of the $(document).ready() function?
[05:33:37] <Cork> yes
[05:33:48] <Cork> and the ready you run from the document head
[05:33:55] <Cork> not in body
[05:34:06] <Cork> then it is guaranteed to act before the page is visible
[05:34:17] <sabotender> eh. I always run scripts in the head
[05:34:34] <sabotender> well. the important ones, anyway :-P
[05:41:30] <wa5ted> grafi: you around
[05:45:22] <sabotender> cork: I cannot hide an element that has not loaded yet
[05:45:33] <sabotender> so that method is not going to work
[05:45:39] <Cork> sabotage: ya
[05:45:44] <Cork> so animate it is then
[05:45:58] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/PjtxS/2/
[05:47:16] <sabotender> you know, when sabotage finds out that you are using his nickname in vain, he won't be pleased :-P
[05:47:39] <Cork> it isn't uncommon for this channel
[05:49:46] <sabotender> im just joshing you
[05:59:36] <enzo> I'd like to submit a form in ajax in order to fetch the submitted form returned from server. So I add the new submit method, but when using $.ajax(url), How can I give to ajax all key=value from the form ?
[06:00:12] <Cork> enzo: serialize()
[06:00:57] <enzo> ok
[06:04:02] <logikos> i'm useing .ajax() to get data from the server, the responce is a javascript array of objects, some objects contain functions .. such as [{"a":1,"b":function(){ /*stuff*/ }},{},{}]  the header responce is returning a Content-Type of text/javascript; charset=utf-8
[06:04:16] <logikos> but jquery just reads it as a string
[06:04:36] <logikos> i thought by sending the text/javascript header .ajax() would auto detect it was a javascript object ?
[06:04:46] <logikos> what am i doing wrong please?
[06:04:48] <Cork> not as a script object
[06:04:58] <Cork> you need to set the data to a variable
[06:05:06] <Cork> as what your sending would be invalid json
[06:05:19] <logikos> right, because of the functions
[06:05:22] <Cork> yes
[06:05:45] <logikos> so if i output var a = [{},{},{}] etc
[06:05:55] <logikos> javascript will auto execute the result
[06:06:01] <logikos> and the var a will be the object i want?
[06:06:13] <Fraz> hey
[06:06:14] <Cork> yes
[06:06:17] <logikos> ty
[06:06:40] <Fraz> im a bit confused. how do you declare functions within a jquery plugin?
[06:07:36] <Cork> Fraz: uh, why would it be different there?
[06:07:38] <sekyms> anyone familiar with socket.io?
[06:07:47] <Cork> Fraz: what are you trying to do
[06:09:22] <Fraz> nm, ive got it now hehe
[06:09:47] <Fraz> i was just reading some tutorials and they mention adding your methods to a methid object or something
[06:12:15] <logikos> Cork: i'm going to do it the way we talked but for my own education, supose i didnt change the header responce from the server, what dataType would i use in the .ajax() function to make it work the same way?
[06:12:20] <logikos> is that jsonp ?
[06:12:30] <logikos> or script
[06:12:42] <Cork> dataType is just the request header
[06:13:02] <Cork> if is for "what type of data do you want the server to send back"
[06:13:05] <digifiv5e> Anyone know how I might inject some post data on the jquery.ui.datepicker function DP_jQuery?
[06:13:30] <Cork> logikos: the content type of the response if what decides
[06:13:44] <logikos> oh, i thought that it told jquery what type of data to expect from the server
[06:13:48] <Cork> logikos: but yes for the server code to even have the possibility to be executed
[06:13:50] <logikos> regardless of responce header
[06:13:54] <Cork> you need to set dataType: "script"
[06:13:59] <Cork> no
[06:14:11] <nicolas_> hi there
[06:14:12] <Cork> it sets what to expect
[06:14:19] <Cork> it doesn't override
[06:14:24] <logikos> i see
[06:14:58] <logikos> ty
[06:16:15] <nicolas_> here is a little 4 fields form : http://jsfiddle.net/M8Yb4/2/ . I have a problem calling the success method of the form. when using require:depends, the input class goes well from "valid" to "error", but the error msg label zone is not changed, despite the success method defined...
[06:16:25] <nicolas_> might be clearer with the jsfiddle
[06:16:42] <antihero> what's like a simple responsive lightbox
[06:18:23] <SillyTalker> the remote data autocomplete demo of jquery mobile does not work on my webserver, what could be teh cause please?
[06:18:28] <SillyTalker> this is the demo i'm talking about: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.0/listview-autocomplete-remote/
[06:18:46] <SillyTalker> help would be appreciated i'm pretty stuck on this
[06:25:41] <pacmac> hello
[06:26:02] <pacmac> could I use ready to execute a function when a load function is completed?
[06:26:51] <pacmac> or should I use XMLhttp?
[06:32:28] <BillCriswell> I could have ice skated to work today.
[06:33:03] <pacmac> BillCriswell: is this allowed? $('#central').load(pagina).ready( function() { ...
[06:33:45] <BillCriswell> pacmac: Don't believe do. I think you want $('#central1').load(pagina, function(){ ... });
[06:33:54] <BillCriswell> s/do/so
[06:34:27] <BillCriswell> I don't recall what load returns so you might also be able to do $('#central1').load(pagina).done(function(){ ... });
[06:34:40] <BillCriswell> I know the first works, total stab at the second.
[06:35:13] <BillCriswell> Ok, the second won't work.
[06:35:37] <pacmac> I want to load() a form into a div and then catch the submit event
[06:35:46] <pacmac> so I think I need XMLhttp
[06:36:24] <pacmac> or add the ajax code into the file containing the form
[06:36:34] <pacmac> well, thank you for your help BillCriswell
[06:36:35] <BillCriswell> pacmac: Hmm...
[06:36:42] <BillCriswell> I think you're overcomplicating it.
[06:36:54] <pacmac> BillCriswell: I usually complicate things a lot haha
[06:37:42] <BillCriswell> You can do like: var $central = $('#central'); $central.load(pagina, function(){ $central.find('form').on('submit', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); }); });
[06:40:20] <pacmac> BillCriswell: I'll try your way, thanks again :)
[06:40:26] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[06:42:50] <pacmac> BillCriswell: It works like a charm, you rock :)
[06:43:02] <BillCriswell> Awesome.
[06:43:10] <nicolas_> anyone got an idea about this problem ? : http://jsfiddle.net/M8Yb4/3/ (validation plugin, success function)
[06:43:42] <PatBateman> hi, can I check orientation change with Jquery, and do a page refresh is that happening?
[06:45:15] <BillCriswell> nicolas_: Your error messages are switched up, but what's the issue you're having?
[06:45:52] <nicolas_> BillCriswell: When you enter something in fieldC1, fieldC2 error label is not correct
[06:46:13] <enzo> $(form).serialize() gives the string key=val, but how can I get the same thing in object style {key: value} ?
[06:46:22] <BillCriswell> nicolas_: You just have things swtiched up: http://jsfiddle.net/M8Yb4/4/
[06:47:10] <BillCriswell> You're doing field2 stuff in 1 and vice versa.
[06:47:12] <pacmac> nicolas_: you have interchanged fieldc1 and fieldc2
[06:47:17] <pacmac> yes
[06:47:23] <nicolas_> BillCriswell: this is not working neither. I want fieldC1 to be required only if C2 is empty, and vice versa
[06:47:46] <nicolas_> BillCriswell: those 2 fields are telephone fields. Only one is required, no mather which one
[06:48:42] <enzo> well serializeArray() seems to do the trick
[06:49:03] <nicolas_> my example is "working" (for inputs). If you look at the code, the input of C1 and C2 are correct (if C1 is filled, both C1 and C2 are "valid"). Problem is, my label is not valid... and I don't know why
[06:49:06] <pacmac> nicolas_: if I understand it, you're trying to clean fieldC1 or fieldC2 if the other is filled, right?
[06:49:33] <nicolas_> pacmac: clean the error label zone yes
[06:49:34] <lasriats> sup guys
[06:50:06] <lasriats> anyone good recognizing cms while viewing the source? I'm trying to figure out what are they using here http://www.bazaredonline.cl/admin
[06:50:32] <enzo> well no, serializeArray gives an array of object, => how can I get an object { key: val} for a form ?
[06:54:14] <hellothere> hey there babes how cant I after this http://jsfiddle.net/ybWp9/ add something like a div or a text ?
[06:59:45] <ElysiumNet> hellothere: that fiddle looks broken
[07:01:35] <kk_drop> this is big image animation: http://bit.ly/JNaLSy it does not works good, but when I resize window (ctrl + mouse scroll) it works well. how can I fix it to work proper from the begining?
[07:16:05] <BillCriswell> Hmmm... fading out droppables is weird.
[07:17:59] <BillCriswell> Oh, works better now... No idea what I do half the time.
[07:18:07] <grafi> ^:D
[07:18:12] <grafi> i know that feeling
[07:18:40] <BillCriswell> Oh I figured out the issue haha. When I have some css animations happening in a div that's fading out it gets all weird.
[07:21:36] <grafi> it would ^^
[07:21:44] <fabioportieri> i heard some users saying that pure css animations (complex ones) on mobile are really buggy and you should stick to js for that.. .what do you think?
[07:22:10] <grafi> no animations on mobile
[07:22:11] <grafi> :P
[07:23:02] <fabioportieri> it's better to avoid them entirely?
[07:23:18] <sekyms> there are some animations that can be animated cheaply
[07:23:51] <sekyms> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/speed/high-performance-animations/
[07:24:15] <grafi> thats cool sekyms
[07:24:25] <grafi> im going to save that to somewhere :p
[07:24:28] <ElysiumNet> BillCriswell: I still haven't figured out the issue with the form submit :|
[07:24:50] <ElysiumNet> current window redirect doesn't work, opening it in a new window, perfect
[07:25:03] <fabioportieri> yeah cool link
[07:25:31] <grafi> so fabioportieri what kind of animations does the site have?
[07:25:46] <fabioportieri> i'm just wondering
[07:25:59] <fabioportieri> on the site i'm working i use uhmm
[07:26:15] <grafi> and for what, obv :P
[07:26:15] <fabioportieri> opacity animated, slide effects
[07:26:49] <kavi> hii..am using jquery load function along with dialog to display a page as popup..now i want to know whether i can hide some div s of the pop page during the load..is it possible??
[07:27:02] <kavi>  - my jquery piece of code - http://pastebin.com/1p4VVfyL
[07:27:12] <grafi> i would avoid anything heavy for mobile, too many shitty phones out there :p
[07:27:23] <sekyms> kavi: seth them to display: none; by default?
[07:28:04] <kavi> i want those divs to appear in other part of the application so in this pop up i want to hide them..
[07:28:41] <PatBateman> how to run a script once when the page loads?
[07:29:25] <kavi> can i do something like $("#test").hide() inside a dialog ?? if s, where should i place
[07:32:54] <kavi> i also want to know whether i can use jquery .load to load a form using its id???
[07:33:12] <NoiseEee> what do you think .load() does?
[07:33:27] <NoiseEee> what does 'load a form using its id' mean?
[07:33:36] <jedimind> grafi
[07:33:40] <jedimind> take a look at jankfree.org
[07:33:42] <jedimind> as well
[07:33:54] <jedimind> for optimizing rendering / draw performance
[07:34:00] <Cork> kavi: yes you can load a form based on it's id
[07:34:02] <jedimind> by the same people who wrote that html5rocks article
[07:34:11] <Cork> if you mean filter it from the response from the servver
[07:34:16] <Cork> *server
[07:35:16] <kavi> cork - thnk u..so can i not hide an element inside a modal dialog?
[07:35:19] <kavi> any idea
[07:35:35] <Cork> kavi: use the callback from load
[07:36:16] <kavi> an example syntax will be really useful...
[07:37:07] <Cork> $('#form-container').load('/path/to/resource #form-id', function() { $('#element').hide() });
[07:37:39] <kavi> thank u..let me try...
[07:43:25] <PatBateman> guys, on an orientation change, if i alert a message, it alerts once. but if I reload the page, it reloads in an endless loop. why could that happen?
[07:43:52] <utroda> I have an event bound to the mousewheel, the code works correctly when using a mouse, but if you use the Mac Trackpad the event fires twice. I'm using $.data(this, 'processing') and changing it cone the animation is done, but it still firing the event twice any ideas?
[07:44:14] <Cork> PatBateman: i guess you alert on page load or something like that
[07:44:19] <rhelic> I need to write JS for a ram limited embedded system browser, are there any projects that will take jQ code and export it to raw (no jQ) syntax?
[07:44:24] <PatBateman> Cork: yes
[07:44:49] <PatBateman> but an orientation change happens on time also i guess
[07:45:01] <PatBateman> or work different?
[07:45:04] <PatBateman> *s
[07:45:28] <Cork> rhelic: very much of the jquery syntax can be written in plain js without much work
[07:45:47] <rhelic> Cork: I know, but I could write it in jQ for speedy dev time, and export it for production
[07:46:11] <Cork> rhelic: haven't heard of one
[07:46:59] <Cork> rhelic: it might be more efficient to just limit the features of jquery
[07:47:24] <kavi> cork : it worked thanks
[07:49:16] <PatBateman> Cork: any idea?
[07:49:39] <Cork> PatBateman: if you reload the page js is reloaded, so it will alert again
[07:49:46] <Cork> i don't see what's strange there
[07:50:33] <PatBateman> no, the problem: the alert shown once, thats OK but
[07:50:54] <PatBateman> i check if orientation is landscape, if it is, I reload the page
[07:51:12] <Cork> and that will reload the script and trigger the alert again
[07:51:27] <PatBateman> and it reloads in an endless loop even I dont move the tablet
[07:51:55] <Cork> then check you statements
[07:52:09] <stacktrace> when calling $(selector),load(url) the page freezes and nothing else can be clicked until the data is returned and loaded. is there a way to call load without blocking?
[07:52:36] <Cork> stacktrace: it should never block by default
[07:52:38] <kavi> <stacktrace> i also have the same issue...
[07:53:26] <stacktrace> yes that is what the docs state
[07:53:35] <stacktrace> no blocking. but it does. well i suppose can port it to an ajax call where i can set the parameters
[07:53:41] <kavi> cork - http://pastebin.com/A61Rv9Df this is my code
[07:53:58] <stacktrace> kavi nice to know it is not just me
[07:54:30] <Cork> can any of you reproduce the problem in jsfiddle.net ?
[07:58:07] <Absolute0> Anyone experienced the chosen select plugin jumping upon selection?
[07:59:55] <kavi> cork - i am doing tat in server side..i ll create a example form and see in jsfiddle
[08:00:26] <Cork> kavi: you can do ajax tests in jsfiddle
[08:14:27] <utroda> I have an event bound to the mousewheel, the code works correctly when using a mouse, but if you use the Mac Trackpad the event fires twice, any ideas on how to fix?
[08:14:40] <kavi> cork - can i have two html files inside the jsfiddle..? so i can give the path in ahref for testing?
[08:15:21] <ventis> @utroda - what are you actually trying to do?
[08:15:57] <Cork> kavi: http://jsfiddle.net/N3w62/
[08:16:08] <ventis> if you're animating, it might be worthwhile setting a status variable (animating = true); in your event handler, then once animation has finished set animating = false.
[08:16:36] <ventis> and in the mousewheel handler, do `return event.preventDefault() if animating == true`
[08:17:10] <utroda> @ventis - on I need the mousewheel event to fire once.. which works when using a mouse, but if you swipe the track pad it fires twice. Code - http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/7
[08:18:04] <utroda> ventis - I'm doing that, but it still fires twice
[08:18:05] <ventis> yeah. on a mac it'll fire tonnes of times, i think.
[08:18:09] <ventis> oh okay.
[08:18:58] <PatBateman> if I want to show eg. 20 div elements, best practice to add the element names with a comma then fire a show() ?
[08:19:25] <PatBateman> is it a limit in numbers ?
[08:19:47] <Cork> PatBateman: just have a class grouping the different elements together
[08:20:25] <PatBateman> yeah but these are container elements, cant do a top containing div ..
[08:20:44] <PatBateman> because there are divs between I have to show
[08:21:05] <Cork> PatBateman: not sure what you mean
[08:21:19] <Cork> if you have different input elements falling into the same group
[08:21:23] <Cork> give them a class
[08:21:28] <PatBateman> i create a paste
[08:21:36] <Cork> and just do $('.class-name').show()
[08:22:20] <hellothere> guys if i do $("something).hide() is there any possible option on creating a div inside a hide ?
[08:22:25] <ventis> utroda: i'm really not sure just by looking. it should work fine. maybe there's latency in jquery's data method – 'processing' isn't being set?
[08:22:51] <Cork> hellothere: inside the hide?
[08:23:07] <ventis> well, it is being set but not quickly enough
[08:23:15] <Cork> hellopat: just daisy chain it
[08:23:23] <Cork> *hellothere:
[08:23:47] <PatBateman> Cork: http://hastebin.com/macixosuhu.coffee
[08:23:48] <PatBateman> second works too and faster right?
[08:23:48] <ventis> does doing this work?
[08:23:48] <ventis> http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/8
[08:23:49] <hellothere> ye like $(something).hide(function(<div>sadjjsaddjas</div>))
[08:23:49] <hellothere> or smthing liek that
[08:23:49] <ventis> oops
[08:23:49] <PatBateman> ventis you do Laravel?
[08:23:57] <ventis> oops - it should be if (processing)
[08:23:59] <ventis> dumb
[08:24:05] <Cork> no
[08:24:11] <Cork> hellothere: $("something').hide().append('something else')
[08:24:11] <ventis> PatBateman: only a little bit. more kohana, why?
[08:24:56] <ventis> utroda: http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/9 - dumb mistake
[08:25:01] <ventis> by me in the last code
[08:25:13] <utroda> ventis - that works
[08:25:15] <ventis> cool
[08:25:33] <hellothere> hmm
[08:26:34] <utroda> weird i wouldn't have got that
[08:26:34] <ventis> jquery took too long to set the processing data flag in that case
[08:26:34] <hellothere> but isnt that gonna change the Something?
[08:26:35] <hellothere> i just wanna create something new for Something
[08:26:35] <ventis> your code looked good dude – it was literally the only thing i could think of
[08:26:35] <cooler> guys, where can I see the code for jQuery.get ???
[08:26:36] <cooler> I'm trying to figure out why .success isn't being called when server returns 304
[08:26:36] <utroda> ventis - thanks, i have been trying to figure it out, i don't think i would have done that
[08:26:53] <ventis> hth mate :)
[08:28:35] <cooler> hello #
[08:29:14] <utroda> ventis - lol nvm that didn't work, didn't once i put the code in the callback to set processing back to false it still fires twice
[08:29:14] <cooler> well, i guess i should go to jquery-development
[08:29:14] <cooler> tks
[08:31:06] <ventis> utroda: lol. what system are you on?
[08:31:15] <utroda> OSX
[08:31:17] <ventis> yeah
[08:31:22] <ventis> we have really sensitive trackpads.
[08:31:37] <ventis> are you swiping pretty hard? if so, the event keeps firing
[08:31:41] <ventis> it might sound rubbish
[08:31:45] <ventis> it kinda is.
[08:32:12] <ventis> it's what makes the site scroll, even after you've stopped scrolling
[08:32:39] <utroda> na, i just give a flick
[08:32:52] <ventis> huh
[08:33:12] <utroda> I just tried, using off then in the callback reset the event and it still fires twice
[08:33:23] <hellothere> well append doenst work for me
[08:33:24] <hellothere> :)
[08:33:27] <hellothere> after hide
[08:33:39] <cooler> utroda, try to unbind
[08:34:05] <utroda> cooler, same result
[08:34:18] <cooler> utroda, hum, thats exactly what i'm doing here, also with a scrolling flag
[08:34:23] <hellothere> hide().append() doesnt work it doesnt append cause it obviously hides that thing prolly
[08:34:36] <ventis> utroda: and if cooler's suggestion doesn't work, try this: http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/a
[08:34:41] <kavi> cork - http://jsfiddle.net/BWy4W/  in this load also doesnt work
[08:34:41] <ventis> there's a variable set to second time
[08:35:00] <ventis> it'll allow you to set a conditional breakpoint in the web inspector and only break on the second event
[08:35:02] <utroda> cooler, this is how i have it setup with unbind - http://paste.jesse-obrien.ca/b
[08:35:05] <ventis> then you can check the call stack
[08:35:35] <ventis> utroda: or, just use underscore and throttle the function: http://underscorejs.org/#throttle
[08:36:00] <cooler> utroda, almost the same I use here
[08:36:27] <kavi> stacktrace - did u figure out the problem???
[08:37:05] <utroda> cooler, yeah its super weird I don't think i have ran into this before, but the code is so simple i dont understand why its not working.
[08:37:11] <cooler> utroda, already tried $(window).off 'mousewheel', your handler
[08:39:08] <cooler> utroda, ?
[08:39:28] <cooler> utroda, dunno why, but try to unbind from window or document
[08:39:28] <utroda> cooler, once sec building a jsbin of it
[08:40:13] <cooler> guys, anyone knows why $.get doesn't run success if http returns 304 ?
[08:42:16] <utroda> cooler, doing it to window/document has the same results
[09:01:03] <ttye0> With jQuery Mobile on pageinit for a page ID I'm running some JavaScript.  If I navigate to/from this page my JavaScript is only run once, but for some reason if I visit the URL directly/manually the JavaScript is run twice.  This seems to be opposite of the problematic behavior that I have found online regarding pageinit firing code more than once.  Does anyone know why pageinit would fire twice when a URL is directly viewed as opposed to once when it's view
[09:01:03] <ttye0> ed from a referring URL?
[09:22:16] <duch_kazatel> goooooooood morning #jquery
[09:22:45] <hellothere> http://jsfiddle.net/8YD4v/1/ how can i make this work bros ?
[09:22:52] <hellothere> any thoughts ?
[09:24:38] <zeroquake> i have a html file with lot of html links -- how do i export the href and inner text to a csv or a text file ?
[09:24:46] <duch_kazatel> hellopat what is your question?
[09:24:50] <duch_kazatel> err, hellothere
[09:25:06] <duch_kazatel> zeroquake that's not a job for jquery.
[09:25:11] <hellothere> my question is at the moment it doesnt work
[09:25:14] <hellothere> i need to make it work?
[09:25:21] <hellothere> i wanna define that code in a jquery code
[09:25:24] <hellothere> and then use it
[09:25:24] <ttye0> Why would jQuery Mobile pageinit fire twice when a URL is directly viewed as opposed to when it's viewed from a referring URL?
[09:25:29] <hellothere> without defining it in html
[09:25:53] <kavi_> hii can anyone suggest a good editor where i can create one html file within the editor and use it another html within the same editor?
[09:26:14] <grafi> what now?
[09:26:30] <NoiseEee> kavi_: like have two files open at once?1
[09:26:48] <kavi_> yes...
[09:26:54] <grafi> sublime can
[09:27:02] <NoiseEee> kavi_: any decent editor.  sublime, notepad++, any real IDE
[09:27:06] <Guest88897> theres not builtin form validation thing in jquery? like confirm password check?
[09:27:10] <grafi> vim can too :p
[09:27:32] <kavi_> NoiseEEE - those have jquery functions available???
[09:28:22] <NoiseEee> kavi_: sure, if you set it up
[09:28:33] <duch_kazatel> hellothere - http://jsfiddle.net/8YD4v/2/
[09:28:39] <duch_kazatel> looks like your css might have problems.
[09:29:08] <duch_kazatel> kavi_ check out sublime text and package control
[09:30:38] <Guest88897> In a form, when a user hits submit button, I want to run a method to validate it first and then the submit call should go. If any errors found in validate method, the call should not go and some error alert be displayed. how to do that?
[09:31:25] <kavi_> ok... can anybody say wat is wrong with this http://jsfiddle.net/BWy4W/
[09:31:35] <duch_kazatel> Guest88897 what are you validating?
[09:32:07] <duch_kazatel> kavi_ in that specific fiddle?  you haven't setup jquery for use.
[09:32:14] <Guest88897> confirm 2 password fields check, name required, etc
[09:32:59] <kavi_> <duch_kazatel> - i have selected jquery 1.9.1 and jquery ui 1.9.2
[09:33:07] <NoiseEee> kavi_: you can't load things on a different domain via XHR/ajax/.get/.post
[09:33:12] <duch_kazatel> Guest88897 Ajax and events.
[09:33:29] <Guest88897> duch_kazatel,  is there an example that i can see?
[09:33:56] <Guest88897> duch_kazatel,  ajax? but I want to validate the form locally on the page
[09:34:08] <kavi_> <NoiseEee> - is there any other way do it ?
[09:34:18] <duch_kazatel> Guest88897 the jquery docs contain a lot of info.  this might help, too - http://jqueryfordesigners.com/using-ajax-to-validate-forms/
[09:34:28] <duch_kazatel> Guest88897 you're checking passwords, right?
[09:34:52] <Guest88897> there are two fileds. password and repeat password.  they both should be same
[09:34:58] <Guest88897> vaues
[09:35:05] <duch_kazatel> aaaah against each other.  events.
[09:35:18] <duch_kazatel> bind to the form submit, prevent default, check, etc.
[09:35:39] <kk_drop> do you know any jquery panorama plugin that will shrink huge image to fit screen widh/height?
[09:35:43] <Guest88897> duch_kazatel,   the even will run before the submit call?
[09:36:03] <kk_drop> tried some various plugins but cou;dn't find any to fit my needs
[09:36:04] <duch_kazatel> Guest88897 "submit" is an event.  you want to trigger on that event.
[09:36:26] <duch_kazatel> rm locally on the page
[09:36:26] <duch_kazatel> [2014:01:10:09:34:03] * jeremib (~jeremib@209.222.5.234) has joined #jquery
[09:36:32] <duch_kazatel> woops
[09:36:41] <Guest88897> but if the fucntion is called, and there are problems in form. the submit call will be done any way
[09:37:05] <Guest88897> duch_kazatel,  what would be the thing that would stop the submit call? despite the validate function runs or not
[09:37:12] <duch_kazatel> Guest88897 not if you prevent the default action. $('form').on('submit', function(e){e.preventDefault();});
[09:37:37] <duch_kazatel> after so you'd put your code after e.preventDefault();
[09:38:12] <duch_kazatel> Guest88897 I'd reccommend reading up on events in javascript.
[09:38:23] <Guest88897> would I have to change the <form Action= url      and method= get ?
[09:38:35] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[09:38:50] <Guest88897> k
[09:38:56] <duch_kazatel> Guest88897 you'd wire it up so that after the validation check runs, it handles the submission for you afterwards.
[09:39:32] <Guest88897> duch_kazatel,  where can i see a working example or demo
[09:40:55] <duch_kazatel> Guest88897 looks like you're getting help in ##javascript
[09:41:00] <duch_kazatel> so i'll let them take over ;)
[09:41:40] <Guest88897> ok. thanks
[09:42:12] <Guest88897> duch_kazatel,  well I got both ways. js and jquery. so asked in both. thansk again

[09:49:02] <zorph> setting css(width) on an image...height doesn't adapt...howto force proportional adapt when using jquery css()
[09:54:57] <kavi_> how to load external url into dialog jquery....??
[09:59:35] <duch_kazatel> kavi_ use an iframe?
[09:59:58] <duch_kazatel> kavi_ or did you want to ajax it?
[10:01:19] <duch_kazatel> zorph if you want to maintain the same ratio, use "auto" on the axis you aren't modifying
[10:01:49] <duch_kazatel> zorph so if you're editing width and want height to "adapt", set height: auto;
[10:02:03] <zorph> oh ya..forgot
[10:02:03] <zorph> thx
[10:02:21] <kavi_> <duch_kazatel> - the thing that is i am having problem with i am using load function to load an internal url in dialog box ..so when i click the click i get the page ...but the buttons inside the pop up page is not functioning...
[10:02:41] <kavi_> so i was wondering is there any other way to do this
[10:03:03] <duch_kazatel> what are the buttons?
[10:03:05] <duch_kazatel> like, for a form?
[10:03:39] <kavi_> s ..pop up page is a form ..
[10:03:50] <kavi_> it has edit delete and submit buttons ...
[10:04:18] <duch_kazatel> kavi_ i'm flying blind here, so it's hard to understand what the issue is.  is this a conventional form?  standard get or post?
[10:04:22] <duch_kazatel> with a regular action?
[10:04:36] <duch_kazatel> or is it using some javascript to power it?
[10:05:27] <kavi_> http://pastebin.com/79UTam0r
[10:05:38] <kavi_> this is the jquery code...
[10:06:01] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't tell me much - your issue is with what it's loading.
[10:06:09] <duch_kazatel> not with the thing that's loading it.
[10:06:11] <duch_kazatel> that make sense?
[10:06:22] <kavi_> and tat href points to an edit form
[10:06:43] <duch_kazatel> sure - the edit form code is where your problems are.  pulling that code into the other page is causing your problems.
[10:07:18] <kavi_> hmm..edit form as a standalone is working....
[10:07:47] <duch_kazatel> wait, you're loading the entire other page into a modal?
[10:08:00] <kavi_> yes
[10:08:11] <bongjovi> Can anyone help me find a HEIGHT reponsive jquery slider?
[10:08:33] <duch_kazatel> kavi_ you need to only load the code for the frame.
[10:08:35] <bongjovi> So the height of the container div might change, and I need it to fit to that and adjust width
[10:08:36] <duch_kazatel> err, form
[10:09:20] <duch_kazatel> not for the whole page.
[10:09:22] <duch_kazatel> start there.
[10:09:28] <kavi_> <duch_kazatel> - just the form ...
[10:09:47] <kavi_> for doing tat do i need to pass the form id to the load?
[10:09:48] <duch_kazatel> kavi_ it sounds like you're loading the other document, doctype, head, body, and all.
[10:09:56] <duch_kazatel> kavi_ do you control the page the form is on?
[10:10:05] <kavi_> yes..
[10:10:33] <duch_kazatel> you need to setup a way to only serve up the html for the form.
[10:10:50] <duch_kazatel> serving up the whole page is going to cause problems.
[10:11:50] <kavi_> but my scenario needs to serve the whole page???
[10:12:07] <kavi_> so is there any other way to do this???
[10:12:18] <duch_kazatel> use an iframe.
[10:12:24] <duch_kazatel> set the source to the other page
[10:13:00] <kavi_> an example pls...
[10:13:04] <zeroquake> how can i get only relative href in an anchor tag ? ex :  "xyz.html" instead of full url
[10:13:20] <duch_kazatel> kavi_ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe
[10:13:55] <duch_kazatel> kavi_ you wouldn't use "load" in that case.  instead you'd write an iframe into your modal.
[10:13:59] <duch_kazatel> or popup or whatever/.
[10:14:38] <kavi_> ok..i ll try tat..
[10:15:00] <duch_kazatel> but loading an entire other page the way you're doing it isn't going to work unless the other page is just the fragment you need.

[10:32:02] <duch_kazatel> you could do $(this).hasClass('.class2')

[11:36:40] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: I'm guessing you're putting the function after you call it.
[11:36:56] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: You can do this way more jQueryish.
[11:40:04] <Ericx2x> What do you mean jquery ish?
[11:40:25] <BillCriswell> You're just not using jQuery to its full potential.

[12:00:01] <david2309> Hi everyone!
[12:00:39] <david2309> i need a filter libary for sepia, grayscale and normal color. did anyone know a nice jquery libary?
[12:02:00] <matzinho> jphase: it's a page with login
[12:05:23] <BillCriswell> david2309: What are your browser requirements
[12:06:21] <BillCriswell> david2309: http://html5-demos.appspot.com/static/css/filters/index.html CSS can accomplish those, but the browser support might be a little lax oddly enough for like... older chrome and firefox.
[12:07:03] <david2309> thanx! ah ok, its only a css effect? i need a filter that apply the effect to the image.
[12:07:46] <BillCriswell> david2309: You can. If you need to adjust the image itself however you'd have to look into canvas maybe?
[12:07:53] <BillCriswell> Haven't played with it much yet.
[12:20:36] <bluepnume> Question: let's say I provide a service which allows 3rd party sites to embed an iframe from my domain, and sign up to my service through that iframe. What can I do to stop 'typejacking' -- in other words, 3rd party sides integrating my iframe, then positioning their own input elements on top of it, in order to capture user-entered passwords?
[12:25:17] <kavi> hi am to access a div element which is inside a iframe in a dialog ...i have given like $("#iframeid").contents.find("#edit-submit").addClass("testing");
[12:30:36] <duch_kazatel> kavi it's contents()
[12:30:40] <duch_kazatel> that's a method, not a property
[12:31:07] <Ericx2x> can someone tell me why i get this error? http://jsfiddle.net/XHy6B/
[12:31:16] <duch_kazatel> rather, that is a property that is a method.
[12:31:18] <kavi> <duch_kazatel - thanks...iframe worked...thnks for ur help
[12:31:24] <duch_kazatel> sure
[12:31:52] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: I told you, you're using the function before it's defined.
[12:32:11] <duch_kazatel> Ericx2x i wouldn't use onclicks like that.
[12:32:44] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: http://jsfiddle.net/XHy6B/1/
[12:32:57] <kavi>  <duch_kazatel>  - nope not working
[12:33:28] <Ericx2x> I'm confused why would the javascript field on jsfiddle put the script below the html?
[12:33:40] <kavi> i even wrote tat in   $('#notes-form"').load(function(){ $("#notes-form").contents().find("#edit-submit").addClass("testing"); 	});
[12:33:43] <Ericx2x> Is that just how it always functions?
[12:33:50] <kavi> where notes-form is my iframe id
[12:33:56] <duch_kazatel> Ericx2x yes.  don't use onclick like that.
[12:34:18] <Ericx2x> what would i use besides onclick?
[12:34:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/XHy6B/2/
[12:34:27] <duch_kazatel> Ericx2x this is simpel stuff.
[12:34:50] <duch_kazatel> kavi why are you using .load() for that?
[12:35:37] <kavi> .after the iframe is loaded i want to retrieve the div element
[12:35:40] <kavi> just tried...
[12:35:45] <duch_kazatel> kavi you don't want to use .load any more.
[12:36:29] <kavi> i took out the .load ..not also not working
[12:36:39] <duch_kazatel> kavi fiddle your code please.
[12:37:12] <duch_kazatel> kavi did you try searching google first?
[12:37:19] <kavi> s
[12:37:22] <duch_kazatel> ?
[12:37:25] <duch_kazatel> what does "s" mean?

[12:44:18] <jsc802> like if the mysql statement doesnt execute right i want it to fail
[12:45:42] <jsc802> oh i figured it out
[12:45:43] <duch_kazatel> jsc802 sure, have your server respond with the correct response code.

[13:15:22] <emzi> Hello; I'm going to use the bellow Parallax Scrolling template as a static page om my website. It's a page (=index.html) divided to some section. The title and menu are shown over all sections. Now, I want to make hide the title and menu on the last section, it's because of a forum embedded in the last section. how to edit the template for it?
[13:15:22] <emzi> http://www.onextrapixel.com/2013/09/18/onepagescroll-js-creating-an-apples-iphone-5s-website/

[13:48:19] <jkoudys> is there an equivalent to .animate({scrollTop: }) that doesn't take the number of seconds to complete the animation, rather it just scrolls at a certain rate (e.g. 10px/ms) until it reaches its offset?
[13:48:51] <jkoudys> I have a scrollTop when you click the little search button on the top-right on http://janeswalk.org, which looks great if I'm scrolled to the bottom, but just looks like a weird delay if I'm already at the top of the doc
[13:49:43] <matzinho> Two Submit forms - the first submit button execute evertything - the second execute nothing - what can be wrong?
[13:51:09] <jkoudys> matzinho, you'll probably want to set up a jsfiddle for that one, noone will help with something so broad
[13:51:50] <duch_lunch> matzinho you only bound your events do one.  that's the best you'll get.
[13:55:57] <NoiseEee> also, why would there be two submit buttons?
[13:56:18] <duch_lunch> something tells me they have two forms.
[13:57:25] <jkoudys> you can have two submit buttons - I've done that in cases where I want a password reset to take the same inputs as the login submit
[13:57:37] <jkoudys> changes the action on the password reset submit
[13:57:54] <grafi> "enter password for password reset"
[13:57:56] <grafi> ^^
[13:58:38] <jkoudys> same email - you fill out the form, it says  'sorry couldn't log you in', and the email's still in the field but the pass isn't. Hit reset
[13:58:52] <duch_lunch> it's two separate apges.
[13:58:54] <duch_lunch> *pages
[13:58:56] <duch_lunch> they PMed me.
[13:59:03] <jkoudys> hah
[13:59:03] <grafi> its not if its not
[13:59:10] <grafi> what now
[13:59:14] <grafi> ho inconsiderate
[13:59:16] <grafi> *how
[14:00:13] <jkoudys> was respnoding to NoiseEee. It also occurs to me these aren't really jquery questions in the first place.

[14:05:03] <titou> (not the size but the area sorry..)
[14:05:12] <grafi> makes more sense
[14:05:27] <titou> I would like the whole picture be rendered with some opacity
[14:05:35] <titou> but not the selected area
[14:05:54] <titou> I'm not sure whether it is easily possible with CSS..
[14:06:59] <duch_kazatel> titou read this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5119327/css-or-javascript-to-highlight-certain-area-of-image-opacity
[14:07:14] <duch_kazatel> you'd need to use a combo of markup and CSS to do it.
[14:07:17] <brcweggs> Does anyone have a favorite ajax file upload script?
[14:08:00] <grafi> titou http://jsfiddle.net/MT4T7/332/ maybe this'll help
[14:08:25] <grafi> top left is a piece that becomes opaque on hover
[14:08:41] <jkoudys> martisj, it logs me in just fine - what is your issue?
[14:09:39] <titou> hmm
[14:10:20] <titou> opacity when hover is not the question :)
[14:10:40] <titou> duch_kazatel: I'm reading
[14:10:56] <grafi> well you should easily able to adapt this into whatever you need
[14:11:13] <grafi> take out the on hover part drag the thing around to select area
[14:11:15] <grafi> etc
[14:13:06] <titou> grafi: not really
[14:13:34] <grafi> because?
[14:14:27] <titou> maybe I don't understand your example but inwhat I understood the hover part replace opacity: 0 to opacity: 1
[14:14:35] <titou> which takes the opacity of the outer div which is 0.3
[14:14:52] <mehwork> how does one normally go about fixing an error from a 3rd party jquery plugin, like: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'style' of undefined
[14:14:53] <titou> for me I need an outer div nearly opaque
[14:14:56] <duch_kazatel> titou it's the same basic technique.
[14:15:08] <jessepollak> If you do $.when(deferred1, deferred2) can you queue multiple callbacks with .then?
[14:15:09] <duch_kazatel> mehwork by figuring out what your code is doing wrong ;)
[14:15:32] <titou> and a small area inside which is let us to see with no opacity the picture under everything
[14:15:36] <mehwork> duch_kazatel: right but how
[14:15:49] <mehwork> duch_kazatel: how do you debug that
[14:15:54] <titou> -is
[14:16:56] <duch_kazatel> mehwork i step through my code and make sure the data i'm passing to the plugin is what it expects.
[14:17:45] <duch_kazatel> you could download the uncompressed version of the plugin and use that while developing.
[14:17:52] <duch_kazatel> to figure it out yourself.
[14:19:26] <dpolivy> Hi all, I'm in need of some help with jQuery Mobile 1.3.2 and BlackBerry OS 7. It seems the -webkit-transform: translate3d() CSS styles are causing the content of my pages to just render as a white page.
[14:20:24] <mehwork> duch_kazatel: that's what i'm already doing, was hoping there was a better way, thanks
[14:20:36] <titou> grafi: ok sorry I miss-understood your example because the background-image didn't showed properly
[14:20:45] <titou> I replaced it and now I can see that's exactly what I need
[14:20:47] <titou> thank you
[14:20:52] <titou> and thank you too duch_kazatel :)
[14:21:10] <grafi> np
[14:21:25] <grafi> there are also some plugins readily available
[14:21:27] <grafi> ;)
[14:36:32] <dpolivy> any jQuery Mobile folks here?
[14:55:55] <brcweggs> dpolivy, not I, but I've always wondered, what's the value of having a separate jquery for mobile?
[14:56:34] <grafi> not separate
[14:56:58] <grafi> more like ui stuff for mobile
[14:59:14] <Axel_> I'd like to wrap an element but return the element it was wrapped in ($("<td></td>").wrap("<tr></tr>") should return the row)
[15:02:34] <brcweggs> grafi, ah gotcha
[15:34:43] <_fil_> hello, apparently my script breaks with IE9 http://terredepaysans.rezo.net/ -- I'm blind as I don't have IE9 at hand
[15:36:22] <_fil_> this one is the uncompressed version: http://terredepaysans.rezo.net/index.src.html - does it break too?
[15:40:45] <grafi> break as in doesnt work at all?
[15:42:59] <grafi> _fil_ if you really want to dig into this, microsoft has some vm images up for the different internet explorer versions
[15:43:15] <grafi> _fil_ http://www.modern.ie/en-us/virtualization-tools#downloads
[15:43:58] <_fil_> it loads a map but not the interest points
[15:44:35] <_fil_> thanks for the tip grafi
[15:49:26] <TheEmpath> haven't been here in years :X
[15:49:45] <TheEmpath> $('#something').load('/beta/somefile.html') is doing two incredibly weird things
[15:49:52] <TheEmpath> 1.) It's tryng to go to http://beta/somefile.html
[15:50:02] <TheEmpath> 2.) its doing an OPTIONS call, not a GET call
[15:50:04] <TheEmpath> is my browser drunk?
[15:54:39] <shoky> TheEmpath are you running that on a webserver?
[15:54:54] <TheEmpath> yes
[15:55:02] <shoky> show the actual code..
[15:55:14] <shoky> and, what's the current page's url?
[15:55:26] <TheEmpath> container.load('/' + window.location.pathname.substr(1) + templateUrl)
[15:55:35] <TheEmpath> yeah i know thers a callback, but thats not important :D
[15:56:27] <shoky> got it online?
[15:56:47] <TheEmpath> negative :/
[15:56:55] <TheEmpath> the watch value for that string, when put together
[15:57:02] <shoky> #2 is a consequence of #1
[15:57:06] <TheEmpath> is "/beta/somefile.html"
[15:57:14] <shoky> so you can relax about the OPTIONS instead of a GET
[15:57:18] <TheEmpath> haha
[15:57:20] <TheEmpath> i was like WTF lol
[15:57:21] <shoky> donno what's causing #1 tho ;p
[15:58:33] <TheEmpath> as usual, it worked just fine yesterday
[15:58:35] <shoky> no request appearing before that OPTIONS one?
[15:58:36] <TheEmpath> works fine in other environments
[15:58:39] <TheEmpath> doesn't work here
[15:59:23] <shoky> didn't put any default settings with .ajaxSetup or smth anywhere else?
[15:59:59] <TheEmpath> i have beforeSend
[16:00:15] <TheEmpath> but only for POST and PUT calls
[16:00:19] <_fil_> anyone with IE9 to help? I need to locate the error on http://terredepaysans.rezo.net/index.src.html
[16:00:24] <TheEmpath> manually set per request
[16:00:55] <zizzl> Hey guys I have a site that's using cartoDB, it's a js map tool that takes in table data and displays it nicely. Anyway it generates HTML when I click an icon (in the pop up/tool tip) i;d like to target that code with jquery to replace some html, is this possible?
[16:02:11] <TheEmpath> im even in the console typing $('#application').load('/beta/templates/dashboard.html')
[16:02:14] <TheEmpath> and i get the same error
[16:02:19] <zizzl> obviously this $('#cartodb-popup-header h1:empty').html("Testing"); wouldn't work since the html is produced after code is loaded
[16:02:23] <zizzl> any ideas?
[16:02:52] <TheEmpath> good god
[16:02:56] <TheEmpath> if i get rid of the / in front, it works
[16:03:05] <TheEmpath> how can this be
[16:03:37] <TheEmpath> is there no cross-server agnostic way to use load?
[16:04:10] <_fil_> zizzl: what u're looking for is a callback
[16:05:06] <zizzl> _fil_ within cartoDB?
[16:05:16] <_fil_> smth like .on('done', function() { jquery code here } )
[16:05:24] <_fil_> within your call
[16:05:26] <_fil_> yes
[16:05:32] <shoky> TheEmpath .load just calls $.ajax anyway
[16:05:40] <TheEmpath> right
[16:05:47] <zizzl> _fil_ oh you've used it before?
[16:05:53] <_fil_> no
[16:05:56] <zizzl> oh
[16:06:18] <shoky> TheEmpath but uhh, try fetching that url with $.ajax i guess, see if same thing happe
[16:06:19] <shoky> happens
[16:06:27] <_fil_> but cartodb has a documentation, and it shows that there are callbacks
[16:06:30] <_fil_> :)
[16:09:27] <ModusPwnens> We have a global ajaxError handler we want to use for 401 errors, but we also have local error handlers we want to run when there isn't a 401 error. However, when there is a 401 error, we don't want the local error handlers to run. Is there a way to do this with jquery?
[16:11:28] <zizzl> _fil_ ah ok, no wonder, thanks for looking... So I was able to get some test jQuery work but doesn't work on the pop ups since those are generated after clicking a pin/icon
[16:11:53] <_fil_> add the callback in the function that generates them
[16:15:19] <Lazuratus> Hi, how can I prevent middle clicking on the link from opening a new tab? http://jsfiddle.net/b2FGu/

[16:18:06] <zizzl> _fil_ ya having trouble finding that...
[16:20:38] <bowenac> having an issue with a script wondering if someone can take a look at the paste bin http://pastebin.com/u9rwwP2t
[16:20:59] <bowenac> I have to onclick events one to trigger wp media manager for the original upload to insert an image
[16:21:34] <bowenac> and another one same thing but for editing the record, when I use the original top one it always inserts the src url into the last input in the edit section
[16:21:49] <bowenac> seems they are conflicting with each other as if I remove one of them the other works as expected
[16:22:07] <bowenac> I recall this all working fine prior to wp 3.8

[16:39:55] <Cornflake> Can someone explain to me why this - http://pastebin.com/QepjXv0k - keeps giving me an error of Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'text' of null
[16:40:03] <Cornflake> But when I take it out of the function, it works fine?
[16:40:51] <duch_kazatel> Cornflake try doing a console.log() of $(".textShuffle") in that.
[16:41:49] <Cornflake> it returns null
[16:42:00] <Cornflake> but there definitely is text in there
[16:42:01] <Cornflake> 		<h1 class="twelve columns">Threats <span class="textShuffle">Insights</span> Simplified</h1>
[16:42:37] <duch_kazatel> and this code is being called after the html loads, right?
[16:43:14] <Cornflake> yeah
[16:43:18] <Cornflake> I put in a document ready
[16:43:26] <Cornflake> well I just disabled all the other plugins
[16:43:27] <duch_kazatel> have a fiddle?
[16:43:32] <Cornflake> So I'm guessing it's conflicting with one of them
[16:53:24] <jabohemian> whats the easiest way to have a jquery ajax request automatically retry on fail

[17:04:44] <jphase> hi hesco
[17:04:46] <jphase> you rang?
[17:05:21] <hesco> hey man, I thought I could extend what you showed me, but I did not get far enough, I'm afraid.

[17:10:55] <Cornflake> forgot to set jquery
[17:11:21] <Cornflake> http://jsfiddle.net/U3cXs/1/ - can someone help me figure out how to fade out before the text changes on this?
[17:11:53] <Cornflake> and then let it fade back in after the text has changed

[17:50:32] <dimitris5> I have this code http://pastebin.com/3beTxD27 On click it makes the image fit the div its inside. How to make it that on the second click it goes back to normal? And then if clicked again fits the image again and on and on in a loop?
[17:53:09] <duch_kazatel> dimitris5 you'll have to record the dimensions of the image before firing the plugin and then size it back down?
[17:53:23] <duch_kazatel> no idea how that plugin works - you able to setup a fiddle?
[17:54:18] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: The point is that I dont know how to do different stuff each time the button is clicked. First click = do something, Second click = do something else. And this in a loop
[17:54:30] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: is there a function or something?
[17:55:24] <duch_kazatel> dimitris5 you'll have to find some form of criteria to check against that then changes what that function does.
[17:56:19] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: Demo http://jsfiddle.net/3CRx7/684/
[17:56:21] <duch_kazatel> dimitris5 you could check your css height, for instance, and see if it matches that formula.
[17:57:32] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: the problem then is that this code will apply to alot of different images. So height wont work
[17:58:25] <duch_kazatel> could you clarify what you mean bye "will apply to alot of different images" - will one link apply to multiple images?
[17:58:31] <duch_kazatel> or one link to one image?
[17:58:49] <duch_kazatel> and example that is indicative of your use case would be helpful.
[17:59:05] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: its going to be a gallery. When user clicks the image fits, saves cookie. And the same code will apply to all images of different sizes
[17:59:25] <duch_kazatel> could you update your fiddle to illustrate?
[18:00:25] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: Not really. 1 image - 1 page. User hits next and a different page loads. Then in header jquery checks if cookie is set and fits the image without the need to press the button
[18:01:01] <duch_kazatel> so the cookie will store the site that the image needs to be?
[18:01:14] <duch_kazatel> sorry, but your use case isn't making sense to me.
[18:01:17] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: the cookie will store if the user clicked "Fit"
[18:02:04] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: if he did click fit on one image then apply fit to all images. So when he hits "Next" to see the next image a different html page loads with a different image
[18:02:33] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: and the cookie is read and fit is applied
[18:03:14] <duch_kazatel> have you looked to see how this plugin works?
[18:03:20] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: the fit elimates the need to scroll down to see the full image. But if he hits fit again then bring image back to normal size and remove cookie
[18:03:32] <duch_kazatel> is hides the original image and sets it as a background on the div.
[18:03:52] <duch_kazatel> *it
[18:04:11] <duch_kazatel> you could run a test to see if the img is hidden and, if so, revert whatever this plugin does.
[18:05:19] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: thank you, I will try
[18:05:50] <duch_kazatel> when the new page loads, you're checking for the cookie and running the same plugin, right?  if so, my plan should work.
[18:12:15] <Fraz> anyone got any fancy shit to show off?
[18:12:30] <visua> yeah
[18:12:32] <visua> ready?
[18:12:35] * visua jazz hands
[18:14:53] <duch_kazatel> Fraz sure - try 0.1 + 0.2 in a javascript console
[18:15:43] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: I think its working. What is the best way to fire the cookie check function to make sure the user doesnt see the origin image before it has time to fit?
[18:16:17] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: in header it doesnt work because the image is not there yet. And in footer he can see how it resizes because its too late
[18:16:51] <duch_kazatel> dimitris5 err, you're not going to be able to do that - the image will have to load first.  the only thing I can think of is to use a display: none; on the image and then remove it after that logic has run.
[18:17:06] <duch_kazatel> but that's hacky - you said you're making a gallery, right?  why not use any of the many gallery plugins out there?
[18:17:21] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: Its an html gallery
[18:17:34] <duch_kazatel> but you're using jquery O.o
[18:17:48] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: only for the fit functionality
[18:18:09] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: 1 html page =1 image. Hit next to see the next html with image in it
[18:18:21] <duch_kazatel> i know. you're loading an entire library of code just to fit images into the screen?  that's... wasteful.
[18:18:41] <dimitris5> duch_kazatel: I too noob with js to do it otherwise
[18:18:49] <dimitris5> *I'm
[18:19:24] <duch_kazatel> there are dozens of decent gallery plugins out there complete with examples to get you rollin', but whatever.
[18:19:32] <duch_kazatel> i have to go home.
[18:19:34] <duch_kazatel> enjoy.

[19:04:22] <dllama> hi guys, i have a quick question (hoefully) .  I have an icon for a relatively simple slideUp toggle,  for some reason though, when i click it, it triggers the action 3 times in my rails app.   yet, i pasted exact same code into jsfiddle and it works exactly as expected.
[19:05:25] <dllama> http://jsfiddle.net/uj3rf/1/
[19:05:38] <dllama> and this is the behavior in my app: http://screencast-o-matic.com/watch/c2VXn8nhhx
[19:09:28] <coldhead> noo ben
[19:11:36] <coldhead> dllama: do you have .row items within .row items?
[19:11:45] <dllama> i do yes,
[19:11:48] <coldhead> becuase that will cause the event to fire "multiple" times
[19:11:51] <coldhead> once per .row
[19:11:56] <coldhead> demo here: http://jsfiddle.net/uj3rf/1/
[19:13:05] <coldhead> dllama: http://jsfiddle.net/uj3rf/2/
[19:13:10] <dllama> hmm, i see, that makes sense
[19:13:12] <coldhead> fixed with stopPropogation()
[19:14:34] <dllama> coldhead, do i use stopPropagation on the event or?
[19:14:43] <dllama> i added it as function(e), e.stopPropogation();
[19:14:47] <coldhead> on the event object that you are calling e
[19:14:49] <coldhead> yes
[19:14:52] <coldhead> that should work
[19:15:01] <dllama> typeerror, object has no method stopPropogation
[19:15:17] <coldhead> line 2 here has that code http://jsfiddle.net/uj3rf/2/
[19:15:19] <coldhead> and it rowks
[19:15:21] <coldhead> works*
[19:15:24] <coldhead> copy pasta?
[19:15:42] <dllama> yea i think i mispelled something
[19:15:46] <dllama> it works now, thank you so much! :)
[19:15:57] <coldhead> best wishes for the rest of your life, dllama
[19:38:18] <Jinxed-> If I have a div, and when I click on it, I want to peform an operation on the div containing that div, how would I do it
[19:38:58] <Jinxed-> IE, I have a rectangle, and in the top right rectangle is a close sign, when somone clicks the close sign, I want to fade out the whole rectangle and then append it into a different section of the document
[19:43:26] <instence> You would use a click function and contain your actions within that
[19:44:00] <coldhead> Jinxed-: http://jsfiddle.net/s5rCY/
[19:44:55] <instence> yea what coldhead posted ;)
[19:45:32] <coldhead> i couldn't have done it without your help, instence
[19:46:47] <instence> lol
[19:53:44] <Jinxed-> coldhead: exactly what I needed
[19:53:54] <Jinxed-> thank you for your help
[19:54:01] <Jinxed-> you too instence (of course)
[19:54:07] <coldhead> you are welcome Jinxed-
[19:58:05] <Jinxed-> coldhead: I tried to expand your example a bit with child going the other way
[19:58:25] <Jinxed-> with $item.child(".marker").fadeIn();
[19:58:43] <Jinxed-> where $item is a div object that is passed to a function
[19:59:07] <Jinxed-> basically I was going to have the child div marker only show up at this point
[20:00:16] <coldhead> if you're doing what i think you're trying to do, Jinxed-, i would do that in pure CSS
[20:01:24] <Jinxed-> still initiated within a click function

[20:12:03] <Jinxed-> coldhead: here is what Im trying to do: http://jsfiddle.net/AZFmc/
[20:12:33] <Jinxed-> I don't get why line 20 isn't valid
[20:12:37] <Jinxed-> of the js
[20:15:01] <coldhead> Jinxed-: your variable is called $item
[20:15:10] <coldhead> and you are referring to item i.e. $(item)
[20:15:19] <coldhead> it probably should be $($item)
[20:15:32] <Jinxed-> lol meta selection
[20:15:34] <coldhead> or better: function (item) { ... and then $(item)
[20:16:40] <Jinxed-> hmm, so when I did $($(item)).closest(".marker").fadeOut(); I get item is not defined
[20:17:09] <elzi> selectorception
[20:18:15] <coldhead> use fewer $s
[20:18:17] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/AZFmc/1/
[20:18:31] <coldhead> just function (item) and then $(item)
[20:19:25] <Jinxed-> i didn't see any changes in the fiddle you jsut psted
[20:19:42] <coldhead> i changed function ($item) to function (item)
[20:23:16] <Jinxed-> hmm
[20:23:21] <Jinxed-> well it runs now
[20:23:26] <Jinxed-> but doesn't do what I want it to do
[20:33:58] <bkdotcom> is this a bug?
[20:34:01] <bkdotcom> jQuery.each({a : 0, b : 0, c : 0, length : 0}, function(k,v) { console.log(k, v); });
[20:34:35] <bkdotcom> the above object does not get iterated over
[20:35:29] <bkdotcom> entire object will get iterated over when length is anything but 0
[20:38:19] <bkdotcom> I guess it's a "feature"  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7356835/jquery-each-fumbles-if-non-array-object-has-length-property
[20:38:38] <coldhead> i blame javascript
[20:38:59] <coldhead> i avoid using length as a property in JS objects
[20:39:03] <coldhead> just to avoid the confusion
[20:39:53] <Jinxed-> Does javascript/jquery play nice with any type of database?
[20:40:08] <Jinxed-> I know I'm asking stupid questions I just don't have the vocab yet to ask them correctly
[20:40:35] <Jinxed-> Basically I'm learning javascript/css/jquery to get a nice front end for this site I want to use to configure things.
[20:40:40] <coldhead> javascript doesn't have much to do with databases
[20:40:53] <coldhead> it usually gets the data from an intermediary like PHP or rails
[20:40:54] <Jinxed-> However each item visually needs to get it's parameters from something
[20:41:01] <Jinxed-> exactly!
[20:41:07] <Jinxed-> I need to store my data somewhere
[20:41:24] <Jinxed-> referesh/generate that data based on some polling
[20:41:31] <coldhead> you'd usually pass the data to JS in JSON format
[20:41:33] <Jinxed-> and then visually represent that in a sexy way using jquery
[20:41:48] <coldhead> because JS is good at dealing with JSON
[20:42:03] <Jinxed-> so I need a database that is able to generate/store json data
[20:42:13] <Jinxed-> would that be something like mysql?
[20:42:23] <coldhead> yes
[20:42:42] <coldhead> youd just just some server side language to talk to the db, JSONify the rsults and pass it back to JS
[20:42:54] <coldhead> just use*
[20:43:10] <Jinxed-> server side language being something like python/php
[20:43:14] <coldhead> yup
[20:43:22] <Jinxed-> any suggestions
[20:43:25] <Jinxed-> on which to use
[20:43:26] <coldhead> and you generally use AJAX to have JS talk to the server
[20:43:32] <coldhead> but you probably know that
[20:43:43] <coldhead> it really depends on what you're comfortable with and what you know
[20:43:47] <coldhead> and what you need
[20:43:50] <Jinxed-> actually no I didn't know that.
[20:44:02] <coldhead> you might even like to use node.js so you can use javascript in the browser AND the server
[20:44:10] <Jinxed-> lol... my background is C++ and it has been awhile
[20:46:33] <coldhead> PHP is probably simplest for you if it's just this once
[20:46:52] <coldhead> but if the project is going to grow then you shoud be using something fancier
[20:47:14] <coldhead> rails and django are nice and good excuses to learn ruby or python
[20:47:46] <bkdotcom> mongodb + node.js ?
[20:48:26] <coldhead> you crazy young people, you kill me
[20:48:28] <Jinxed-> I actually have some experience with pythong (very limited) but the little I have done is like super simplified C++
[20:48:35] <Jinxed-> everything is just way way easier to do
[20:48:41] <Jinxed-> assuming you know the syntax
[20:49:20] <Jinxed-> hey coldhead I started with basic/c/c++/assembly
[20:49:31] <Jinxed-> now I'm just trying to get to the fancier stuff online
[20:50:46] <coldhead> it probably makes sense to keep going with python then
[20:50:51] <Jinxed-> nice
[20:50:52] <coldhead> it's a nice language
[20:51:05] <Jinxed-> plus python can run terminal commands which is essential for this project
[20:51:08] <coldhead> plus google use it so it makes you more hireable
[20:51:39] <Jinxed-> Alright so let me attempt to summarize my attack plan and see if this makes sense to you.
[20:51:50] <coldhead> okay
[20:51:57] <coldhead> but i just took a bunch of pills so we'll see how we go
[20:53:05] <Jinxed-> The overall goal is to create a web user interface which will allow me to configure different voice conferences in asterisk. Basically I can drag different phones together and press the connect key and it will connect them. I already have the phoneside figured out, I just need an interface to initiate various scripts.
[20:53:23] <Jinxed-> Jquery/Javascript/html/Css will be the heart of user experience
[20:53:40] <Jinxed-> I will need to write some scripts which polls phone status and updates mysql data base of the status
[20:54:17] <Jinxed-> I will need to use python to retrive information from the database and convert it to json to be consumed by the jquery etc to change the user interface
[20:54:35] <coldhead> sounds fun
[20:54:35] <Jinxed-> the user interface should also be able to initiate scripts etc based on what I drag around
[20:54:50] <Jinxed-> yeah, should be a good learning experience
[20:55:02] <Jinxed-> So what is ajax used for
[20:55:50] <coldhead> ajax lets javascript talk to the server
[20:55:55] <coldhead> without having to reload the page
[20:56:19] <coldhead> so if your user dragged a connection, the JS could detect that and fire off a request to the server to make the actual connection or whatever
[20:56:27] <coldhead> without having to wait for the page to reload or whatever
[20:56:51] <coldhead> i'm told a microframework like this would be a good starting point for your python needs http://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/
[20:56:52] <vsoftoiletpaper> helloo
[20:57:01] <vsoftoiletpaper> I need slideToggle+fadeToggle
[20:57:14] <vsoftoiletpaper> or toggle without the horizontal shrink
[20:57:42] <coldhead> Jinxed-: best "general" advice i have is to read up on AJAX and try to make your web service "RESTful"
[20:58:06] <coldhead> for more on which see google
[20:58:18] <vsoftoiletpaper> so it is able to REST, when not in use
[20:58:33] <coldhead> vsoftoiletpaper: you can just use animate to create your own custom animations
[20:58:48] <Jinxed-> will look at... question though...
[20:58:54] <Jinxed-> what is the purpose of the framework
[20:59:08] <Jinxed-> or /microframework
[20:59:10] <coldhead> to let your python code talk to a web browser
[20:59:45] <coldhead> it creates a simple web server and does the "routing" for you, so you can write code that says "if someone requests /phone/7/connect then run THIS function"
[20:59:50] <vsoftoiletpaper> coldhead  :(
[20:59:54] <vsoftoiletpaper> that is so much work
[21:00:04] <coldhead> and then your JS just makes an AJAX request to the appropriate URL
[21:00:25] <vsoftoiletpaper> toggle() would be perfect if it hadn't the silly horizontal shrinking
[21:00:35] <coldhead> Jinxed-: you can't talk to python DIRECTLY from javascript but you can make requests to URLs that trigger your python code
[21:00:48] <coldhead> it's really not that much work, vsoftoiletpaper
[21:00:55] <coldhead> .animate({height: 0})
[21:06:17] <vsoftoiletpaper>  animate({height:'toggle', opacity: 'toggle'})
[21:06:28] <coldhead> looks good to me
[21:06:31] <coldhead> that wasn't so hard!
[21:06:32] <vsoftoiletpaper> coldhead this kind of works but there is an initial jump which doesn't happen with toggle('slow')
[21:06:45] <vsoftoiletpaper> something different must be happening
[21:07:02] <coldhead> hmm, maybe you need the element to be display:black in css
[21:07:05] <coldhead> block*
[21:07:09] <coldhead> before you animate
[21:07:23] <coldhead> you can look at the jquery code to see what toggle() actually does
[21:07:32] <coldhead> i believe it's just calling animate() behind the scenes
[21:09:17] <vsoftoiletpaper> coldhead this? https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/3ca883f863f8c4b3b1153e63ef40a8c2c523d399/src/css.js#L439-L451
[21:11:08] <coldhead> right so it's just calling hide and show
[21:11:20] <coldhead> which themselves just call showHide
[21:12:58] <vsoftoiletpaper> coldhead but in that toggle function there is no speed parameter
[21:13:11] <vsoftoiletpaper> and toggle accepts a speed parameter
[21:13:26] <vsoftoiletpaper> and more
[21:17:28] <coldhead> vsoftoiletpaper: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/085814474e4a854d533b5ccbaef24c090081e0c4/src/effects.js#L572
[21:17:34] <coldhead> that looks more promising
[21:17:53] <coldhead> do you have a demo of the bug you're seeing?
[21:45:05] <vsoftoiletpaper> coldhead: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/jgrlA
[21:45:14] <vsoftoiletpaper> the problem is the margin
[21:45:35] <vsoftoiletpaper> With margin 0, animate works flawlessly
[21:46:16] <vsoftoiletpaper> animate({height:'toggle', opacity:'toggle', margin:'toggle'})
[21:46:25] <vsoftoiletpaper> I guess this fixes the problem..
[22:26:01] <emzi> I'm going to use the below parallax scrolling template as a static page on my website
[22:26:09] <emzi> Demo: http://www.onextrapixel.com/examples/apple-iphone5s-website-one-page-scroll/ => How to remove those `three buttons (Demo1, Demo2, Demo3)` and `Title` from last section (=that green one)?
[22:26:31] <emzi> The title and menu are shown over all sections. Now, I want to make hide the title and menu on the last section, it's because of a forum is embedded in the last section. how to edit the template for it
[22:28:01] <goingggs> hey, i want to make a very graphically interactive one pager, like rollovers that popup info and then click to a new site, what is the best/easiest platform to build this on?
[22:28:33] <goingggs> something I can input to wordpress front page
[22:49:57] <emzi> Can anybody help me? -> Demo: http://www.onextrapixel.com/examples/apple-iphone5s-website-one-page-scroll/ => How to remove those `three buttons (Demo1, Demo2, Demo3)` and `Title` from last section?
[22:52:20] <jphase> emzi: it looks like he has an afterMove event you can hook into for that probably
[22:53:46] <jphase> emzi: line 105 of his source: https://github.com/peachananr/onepage-scroll/blob/master/jquery.onepage-scroll.js
[22:54:23] <jphase> not sure what params that would take or anything, prolly have to console.log some stuff but it looks like it's supposedly capable hehe
[23:29:42] <soee> is it good idea to look for an element by data-* attribute ?
[23:30:03] <soee> is there any performance difference when using class instead ?
[23:36:19] <coldhead> soee: using a class should be faster because the browser can use a native querySelectAll
[23:36:39] <coldhead> which probably won't support data-*
[23:37:10] <coldhead> so jquery will have to do the search for you which is slower
[23:38:41] <soee> seems so: http://jsperf.com/class-attribute-vs-data-attribute-selectors/6
[23:41:01] <igcewieling> Are jQuery UI questions OK here?
[23:57:24] <jphase> igcewieling: yep
