[07:23:55] <uskerine> hi, I would like to get recommendations for front-end webapp frameworks. Must have: spreadsheet widget or at least sort kind of useful editable datatable widget, must be: simple.
[07:24:13] <uskerine> framework=library
[08:34:10] <printForever> yo yo yo
[08:34:15] <printForever> whats up
[08:34:28] <printForever> couldn't find anyone last night online
[08:41:15] <printForever> Is it possible to make Typed.js output words instead of single character?

[11:21:37] <mrcirca> hello is there any web framework that doesnt allow users to download pictures?
[11:24:00] <snover> no
[11:49:54] <average> mrcirca: what does that even mean
[11:50:11] <average> nonsensical
[11:51:26] <mrcirca> what i mean is that, i want users cant download images from source code
[11:52:50] <average> still no sense
[12:11:47] <aiena> Suppose I want to search for a div with class so and so and id so and so ? How do I do that I know you can use $("div[class=cls1]").function() to execute function() on a div with class "cls1" what If I want to find a div wtih "cls1" and id "idx" ?
[12:22:51] <guzzlefry> Does simply including jquery take a significant amount of time? Not the download, but the actual initialization of the functions and such.
[12:26:37] <average> guzzlefry: why don't people measure it
[12:26:41] <average> the answer is most certainly no
[12:26:47] <average> but why don't you just measure this crap
[12:26:58] <average> guzzlefry: there's definitely other stuff that's much more time consuming
[12:27:07] <average> so you're barking at the wrong tree if you think jquery loading is slow
[12:27:17] <guzzlefry> 0.o
[12:51:41] <aiena> I dont think jquery loading is slow
[12:52:21] <aiena> the download period is what makes a site slow usually not execution time so much
[13:12:35] <pakiya> hi
[13:55:49] <red_> i have a few questions can someone help me out?
[13:56:39] <red_> anyone?
[13:57:52] <red_> seriously guys there's like 200 people here and no one can answer some question? bravo.
[14:03:31] <guzzlefry> Just ask your question. :P
[14:03:58] <systemfault> We've got ourselves a genius.
[14:04:04] <systemfault> **clap** **clap** **clap**
[14:04:48] <guzzlefry> I try my best.
[14:04:58] <systemfault> <3
[14:05:13] * systemfault hugs guzzlefry 
[14:05:24] <guzzlefry> A lot of channels put "Don't ask to ask." in the topic just so it's more obvious.
[14:07:00] <systemfault> Yeah... with time, it becomes irritating to tell people "Ok X, you can now ask your question"
[14:07:54] <systemfault> More over, when a person says that, it unfortunately elects him/her as the person who's going to help... even thought that person might not be able to.
[14:20:17] <red_> Okay, what exactly is jQuery
[14:20:39] <red_> is it a library for JavaScript?
[14:21:03] <average> red_: it's the best javascript library
[14:21:42] <average> red_: react and angular have tried to replicate the success but it didn't work
[14:22:03] <systemfault> It's a DOM (The JS API to work with Nodes) abstraction layer, it makes it easier to do DOM operations. That's it.
[14:22:27] <systemfault> React and Angular are not even in the same category.
[14:22:54] <systemfault> They're framework to write JavaScript applications in the browser.
[14:25:13] <printForever> how can I test if the browser has scrollbar or not?
[14:25:42] <red_> @systemfault Can you simplify it a bit, i'm new so i don't quite understand what you meant
[14:25:59] <systemfault> Which part?
[14:28:37] <printForever> I'm getting the same result using both window.outerWidth and window.innerWidth
[14:28:58] <printForever> As its not taking the account the scrollbar at all.
[14:31:29] <guzzlefry> scrollbar relative to which element?
[14:31:50] <systemfault> printForever: Perhaps that comparing the scrollHeight vs clientHeight on the body would work, I'm not sure.
[14:32:12] <printForever> guzzlefry: to the viewport
[14:32:23] <printForever> document.body.clientWidth;
[14:32:30] <printForever> is the only one that gives correct result
[14:32:42] <printForever> Stackoverflow helped
[14:34:34] <systemfault> I was assuming vertical scrolling :/
[14:57:58] <printForever> systemfault: no, sorry :)
[15:02:55] <aiena> red_: Basically the DOM is more or less you HTML structure (Not exctly) but basically jquery allows you to traverse this structure. E.g. Bind an event to an object with a particular class/id Or say do something to all items that are children of a list/div etc.
[15:03:31] <aiena> jquery forms the basis for many other libraries.
[15:03:54] <aiena> jquery makes very long lines of code short
[15:04:22] <aiena> I love jquery because it makes for instance AJAX so easy.
[15:05:19] <aiena> Also a pure javascript likne like document.getElementById("someId") becomes $("#someId") in jquery
[15:05:38] <aiena> *line
[16:23:57] <printForever> how can I stop script from exectuing?
[16:25:54] <printForever> guys
[16:35:24] <printForever> https://jsfiddle.net/z6nhpuaw/6/
[16:35:28] <printForever> can anyone help out?
[16:38:06] <printForever> Anyone here/
[16:38:12] <printForever> come on :)
[16:40:34] <printForever> where is sterndata? :)
[16:48:07] <printForever> aiena
[16:48:25] <printForever> systemfault: are you here?
[16:51:57] <printForever> I've fixed it!!!
[17:03:27] <jacob144> hey I'm trying to use Jquery to open a new window, but I want the button that opens the new window to disappear on the page that it was originally on even if the page was loaded on a new tab
[17:14:43] <printForever> jacob144: use on click event
[17:15:28] <printForever> $('#mybutton').on('click'... and then ... $(this).remove(); and you are done
[17:20:28] <jacob144> Okay so that got me half way there. Now I need the button to be gone on other tabs also when they are refreshed.
[17:20:34] <jacob144> How Might I do that?
[17:21:01] <dni-> write a cookie
[17:22:08] <printForever> yes... cookie
[17:22:26] <dni-> http://www.w3schools.com/js/tryit.asp?filename=tryjs_cookie_username
[17:25:21] <printForever> yeah
[17:25:24] <printForever> dni
[17:25:36] <printForever> is this the same https://jsfiddle.net/39n9bjvd/
[17:25:41] <printForever> I just wanted to check
[17:26:45] <jacob144> So when the pop up window is closed would I just erase the cookie?
[17:27:09] <printForever> or change the cookie
[17:27:43] <printForever> dni, can you please check my fiddle?
[18:20:32] <jacob144> printForever https://thepasteb.in/p/O7h5z1nx633Fq And the html https://thepasteb.in/p/AnhrLp4OOlXiv this code still isn't working. I must have something wrong
[18:23:28] <carpii> my site has a common jquery script included for all pages, and then various pages also invlude their own scripts. What I want is a way to insert a global "a".click handler, which will run before any page specific handlers. Is this possible, maybe by inserting it as the first event handler or something?
[18:23:54] <carpii> in essence, Im trying to detect any links to my site which are not using https, and then flag them up as its a code bug.
[20:01:35] <esmic> how can i put parenteses the right way here in the onclick tag: document.getElementById('tlf').innerHTML += '<a href="" data-role="button" class="ui-btn" onclick="window.open("tel:300300300", "_system");">Call us</a>';
[20:06:51] <carpii> its not the paranthesis thats the probem, but the embedded quotes
[20:06:56] <carpii> use \" or '
[20:07:11] <carpii> but even better, rewrite it as a jquery handler instead of an onclick
[20:24:22] <esmic> @carpii ty
