[02:30:30] <Rockwood> i am facing this error --> http://dpaste.com/3SVGPNJ
[02:31:33] <Woet> Rockwood: whats unclear?
[02:32:29] <Rockwood> oh sorry docs need to read
[02:32:38] <Woet> as usual.
[02:42:13] <Rockwood> Woet, i followed the docs about including libs of js and css but still the same error
[02:42:54] <Woet> Rockwood: all you have to do is copy paste the example.
[02:42:55] <Woet> Rockwood: theres an obvious mistake in your error.
[03:53:04] <Lenswipee> hi, how to wait after .click() has done its work before doing someFunction()?
[03:58:45] <pavonia> Do you have control over that handler?
[04:01:20] <Lenswipee> pavonia: .click makes an ajax call. seems to be the problem
[04:03:24] <Lenswipee> click().done(){..}???
[04:04:07] <pavonia> Yeah, something with promisses might work, but I don't know how to do that
[04:05:43] <Lenswipee> that code seems erroneous
[04:06:06] <Lenswipee> seems .click() doesn't support .done()
[04:07:03] <pavonia> I think you have to return a promise from the click handler
[04:09:16] <pavonia> Lenswipee: Have a look at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21040672/jquery-done-on-a-click-event
[04:10:02] <Lenswipee> ok thanks
[04:31:28] <Rockwood> Woet, http://dpaste.com/37GW05A  still the same error
[05:16:16] <Woet> Rockwood: that code does not result in the same error.
[05:29:35] <Rockwood> Woet, what could be cause of this?
[05:37:03] <debron> hi guys, im following some instructions to get a upload progress bar working, through an ajax form
[05:37:29] <Rockwood> debron, any issue are you facing?
[05:38:06] <debron> but the settings beforeSubmit and uploadProgress ain't being executed
[05:39:19] <debron> there are functions defined there, i use alert() to check if its being executed or its not
[05:40:20] <Rockwood> make test case
[05:40:24] <debron> and they arent . Even when the form is being submited, files upload .. so form submission its done successfully, but it wont enter inside functions defined inside beforeSubmit and uploadProgress
[06:07:21] <Rockwood> Woet, problem solved
[06:07:23] <Rockwood> thanks
[06:07:26] <Rockwood> for hint
[06:26:08] <debron> ok i realised what the problem was now
[06:26:16] <debron> i didnt add the jquery form plugin script to my page
[06:26:36] <debron> thanks for the hint Rockwood , I actually reealise that by isolating small example
[06:36:26] <noregret> i'm trying to select all href attribs in a browser console, but i'm only getting the first one, https://i.imgur.com/7dXDcB8.png - wht can I do in this case?
[06:38:41] <debron> nope that didnt solved, it was something else :(
[06:53:22] <pete___> Hey everyone, I'm looking at loading jquery with a sync (ie: <script async type="text/javascript" src="/js/jquery.2.2.4.min.js"></script> in the header) and I was wondering how I can make sure it is actually loaded before doing anything with it? AFAIK just doing $(document).ready(function() { ... will cause an error as jQuery won't be defined?
[10:35:11] <how2hack> hi, is it possible to do $.getScript but only once? I mean the first time i need to load the script it will fetch it using ajax, but the next time it will be already loaded and ready to be used
[10:35:25] <how2hack> is there any method that does this already? or do i have to manually do it?
[10:36:25] <AdamPDotty> I would expect most browsers to take care of that.
[10:37:10] <AdamPDotty> It is still a HTTP-Request that gets cached.
[10:37:16] <pavonia> ^
[10:38:09] <AdamPDotty> also have a look at $.ajaxSetup({
[10:38:09] <AdamPDotty>   cache: true
[10:38:09] <AdamPDotty> });
[10:38:15] <how2hack> even if it is inside a handler that will get called everytime i click/input/etc?
[10:38:54] <how2hack> i've been reading about cache: true and looks like it's not always working
[10:39:29] <AdamPDotty> in the end you send a request, as long as the request is the same, you get the cached result. That is why some projects use timestamps in the name to get around it.
[10:39:40] <how2hack> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12884097/jquery-getscript-caching
[10:40:40] <how2hack> i'm concerned about that happening, because i'll be hosting this on a not-so-powerful server and i would like to reduce the server load as much as possible
[10:41:03] <pavonia> Is your server even handling caching correctly?
[10:42:11] <how2hack> hmm i don't remember configuring anything related to caching in httpd
[10:42:26] <how2hack> doesn't it come configured for caching by default?
[10:44:45] <how2hack> yes it's configured by default i can see 304 for static files
[10:46:07] <how2hack> ok so, isn't unnecessary for the client to run $.getScript() everytime the handler is triggered?
[10:46:30] <how2hack> or is it negligible?
[10:47:34] <how2hack> maybe it's worth to put it on a function and call it in case the library/script is not loaded?
[10:48:46] <pavonia> Have you actually observed any duplicate loads?
[10:49:19] <how2hack> not yet for the js file
[10:51:58] <pavonia> I would probably defer this until you actually notice a drop in performance
[10:53:00] <how2hack> yes, i rushed a little, i'm about to start testing this
[10:54:23] <how2hack> is it possible to enable caching in the shorthand $.getScript()?
[11:03:30] <how2hack> i'm now observing duplicate loads for this request: $.getScript({ url: '', cache: true }, function( data, textStatus, jqxhr) { console.log(jqxhr.status) })
[11:04:09] <taplar> "url: '' "  wut?
[11:04:26] <how2hack> i didn't write the url here
[11:04:37] <how2hack> its a local url
[11:04:52] <taplar> that console.log will happen so long as the request returns successfully
[11:05:14] <how2hack> the problem is cache: true is not working at all
[11:05:28] <taplar> cache has nothing to do with that success happening
[11:06:35] <how2hack> what's wrong with that success?
[11:06:56] <taplar> nothing.  it will happen so long as nothing goes wrong with the getScript method
[11:07:07] <taplar> also in regards to the cache option
[11:07:09] <taplar> "If set to false, it will force requested pages not to be cached by the browser. Note: Setting cache to false will only work correctly with HEAD and GET requests. It works by appending "_={timestamp}" to the GET parameters. The parameter is not needed for other types of requests, except in IE8 when a POST is made to a URL that has already been requ
[11:07:09] <taplar> ested by a GET."
[11:07:23] <taplar> cache set to true is the default of ajax.  setting it to true doesn't do anything
[11:07:39] <how2hack> then why is it fetching the resource everytime?
[11:07:46] <taplar> because you are telling it to
[11:07:50] <taplar> you are performing the operation
[11:08:02] <how2hack> then what is the purpose of cache: true?
[11:08:07] <how2hack> it is not caching...
[11:08:11] <taplar> so it doesn't do what cache false does
[11:08:17] <taplar> cache false is to break caching
[11:08:24] <taplar> cache true, says, don't do that
[11:08:37] <how2hack> well, i'm seeing a 200 response everytime...
[11:08:44] <taplar> because it's doing the request
[11:08:44] <how2hack> instead of 304
[11:09:09] <how2hack> isn't cache supposed to use the cached resource?
[11:09:16] <how2hack> instead of fetching it again?
[11:09:17] <taplar> no
[11:09:32] <how2hack> then there's no difference between cache: false and true...
[11:09:35] <taplar> cache for ajax has nothing to do with if your browser gets the resource from cache or not
[11:09:51] <pavonia> What?
[11:09:54] <taplar> all cache false does, is puts a timestamp on the url, so it will not match the browser cache (potentially)
[11:09:57] <how2hack> then it is the browser's fault for not using the cache resource?
[11:11:13] <taplar> if you only want it to do the request once, ever, guaranteed, you have to store the ajax promise in a variable and any time you want to use it again, get the result again
[11:11:38] <how2hack> yes, that's what i'm thinking, seeing as cache: true is not reliable
[11:11:57] <taplar> it's not that it's unreliable.  it's just not doing what you thought it was doing, :)
[11:13:50] <how2hack> i thought jquery was in control of the requests, but it is the browser the one performing them and for some reason it ignores the cache option?
[11:14:03] <pavonia> taplar: Do you have a reference for that ajax() is not using the browser caching system?
[11:14:19] <taplar> That would be a server configuration issue, to me
[11:14:23] <taplar> @pavonia
[11:14:33] <taplar> if the server is not letting the browser cache the endpoint
[11:15:11] <how2hack> hmm but i can see 304 for other resources loaded via html (link, script) and css
[11:15:33] <taplar> so those are cached
[11:16:00] <how2hack> it caches those, but not the ones requested with ajax
[11:17:59] <pavonia> Did you check the status code for your script server-side?
[11:17:59] <taplar> if you try to get that endpoint with the browser, do you get a 304?
[11:18:29] <taplar> try opening a new tab, putting in the url, and just refreshing a few times and see if you get a 304
[11:19:32] <taplar> also, i take back what i said about the cache: true not doing anything.  For ajax that would be true, however, getScript changes the default to false, so setting it manually to true for getScript is actually a thing.
[11:19:56] <taplar> but that still just affects the cache busting mechanism of jquery
[11:20:58] <how2hack> yes, if i open the resource directly in the browser i get 304
[11:21:07] <taplar> weird
[11:21:40] <pavonia> I suspect xhr.status not reporting the correct status code, I think I had a similar issue once
[11:25:15] <how2hack> no, i'm not checking that one, i have the developer tools open the network tab and i can see the green 200 status
[11:25:39] <taplar> look at the request url and make sure it's not putting any timestamp on it
[11:27:57] <how2hack> now it's getting cached
[11:28:43] <how2hack> weird things happens sometimes
[11:42:54] <how2hack> can i return inside .done()?
[11:43:27] <how2hack> if i need to do a post request inside a function can i return inside .done()?
[11:43:40] <taplar> return where?
[11:43:48] <taplar> it's asynchronous, :)
[11:44:00] <how2hack> inside .done(function() { return result })
[11:44:07] <taplar> but where would it return to?
[11:44:16] <how2hack> yes, but the done() won't get executed until the request has finished
[11:44:25] <taplar> the point of execution that started the ajax has already moved on past the point of where it was
[11:45:36] <how2hack> i have a function that shows a message, it needs the msg code as parameter, now this other function performs a post request and the result is the msg code that needs the first function
[11:45:52] <how2hack> so i do ShowMsg(postData(data))
[11:46:03] <taplar> so you call the function that needs the code inside the done
[11:46:27] <how2hack> hmmm yes that makes more sense
[11:46:37] <how2hack> :P
[11:46:58] <taplar> it's a different paradigm to keep in mind when working with async.  you have to think in the terms of the callbacks
[11:50:09] <how2hack> yes, my problem is i don't let go of the first approach that first comes to my mind... i don't even take the time to think if it's the correct one... it's frustrating
[11:50:41] <taplar> that's fine.  it can take a bit.  i remember learning async and hurting my brain for a while
[11:51:14] <taplar> repetition is the best teacher, :)
[11:53:56] <how2hack> like trial and error?
[11:54:36] <taplar> just repeating stuff.  having to solve the same problem over and over drills the approaches to the problem into your head
[11:56:12] <taplar> which is also a reason that hanging out in a room like this is a good thing.  you get to see people asking questions and you get to see the approaches people suggest
[11:56:33] <taplar> S.O. is good in that regard also
[13:00:01] <adgtl> Folks
[13:00:07] <adgtl> in my application I see this error
[13:00:08] <adgtl> $header.find('.dropdown-submenu a')
[13:00:08] <adgtl> jquery.js:2170 Uncaught TypeError: matchExpr[type].exec is not a function
[13:00:17] <adgtl> this only happens for not present DOM element
[13:00:33] <adgtl> this does work
[13:00:34] <adgtl> $header.find('.dropdown-submenu')
[13:00:34] <adgtl> jQuery.fn.init [prevObject: jQuery.fn.init(1)]
[13:00:38] <adgtl> not sure what's wrong
[13:01:06] <taplar> can you make a fiddle showing the issue?
[13:01:22] <adgtl> hmm
[13:01:34] <adgtl> difficult... it's happening with webpack build
[13:02:56] <taplar> because I don't see anything with either of those find statements that should cause that error
[13:04:51] <adgtl> taplar any element not present .. throws that error
[13:04:55] <shoky> adgtl: maybe you're including some other library that is doing naughty things like changing Object.prototype or who knows what
[13:05:15] <adgtl> shoky how to find which library is changing  Object.prototype
[13:05:46] <shoky> adgtl i dunno of a quick way
[13:05:57] <adgtl> okay
[13:06:07] <adgtl> but I am majorly stuck because of this issue
[13:06:25] <shoky> are you includign some big libraries/frameworks?
[13:06:30] <shoky> other than jquery
[13:07:25] <adgtl> yes
[13:07:28] <adgtl> many
[13:07:58] <adgtl> https://gist.github.com/500b36e1883d375093211a201b91e1f1
[13:15:00] <shoky> adgtl: welp, donno, maybe search for  `Object.prototype` or something :|
[13:15:13] <adgtl> shoky there are so many of them in source
[13:17:09] <shoky> adgtl: coming from which lib? :P
[13:17:20] <adgtl> shoky hmm not sure
[13:20:08] <adgtl> so I have a JS which have bunch of JS functions under. (function ($) {
[13:20:20] <adgtl> that JS name is theme.js
[13:20:32] <adgtl> now from app.jsI import that js with
[13:20:45] <adgtl> import "./theme.js"
[13:21:49] <adgtl> will that execute the  (function ($) {  code
[13:22:00] <adgtl> or do I need to return module.exports etc?
[13:22:06] <adgtl> how does that work
[13:23:41] <shoky> it'll probably get executed once. not jquery-related tho,  more webpack and ES modules
[13:26:17] <adgtl> this is major problem https://www.dropbox.com/s/diubdkunudgcbuj/Screenshot%202018-08-08%2022.56.07.png?dl=0
[13:26:32] <adgtl> shoky hmm
[13:27:12] <shoky> adgtl maybe theme.js is the naughty one
[13:27:19] <adgtl> shoky yeah
[15:18:30] <ceramicskull> Hey guys, I'm trying to redirect a page using replace on page load if the path matches /blog in it. But I'm trying to add a param to it as well, is there a simple process in doing so? http://jsfiddle.net/4smacore/
[15:19:15] <ceramicskull> It would also need to match if they come from a direct link to example.com/blog/blog-title-name
[15:20:33] <taplar> this is more of a ##javascript question
[15:20:48] <taplar> string manipulation and what not
[15:21:07] <robertmaxrees> or for your server-side language.
[15:21:59] <ceramicskull> Can one of you help in ##javascript? Most of the people I encounter there are rude, and #jquery tends to be a much better environment for learning haha sorry
[15:22:43] <ceramicskull> Hey guys, I'm trying to redirect a page using replace on page load if the path matches /blog in it.

[15:22:44] <ceramicskull> http://jsfiddle.net/4smacore/
[15:22:46] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:22:53] <robertmaxrees> no need to repost in this channel duder.
[15:23:05] <robertmaxrees> also: there a reason you're not doing this server-side?>
[15:23:06] <ceramicskull> D:
[15:23:23] <ceramicskull> I only have access to FE
[15:23:36] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[15:24:31] <ceramicskull> Sorry I thought that was meant for BE.
[15:24:43] <robertmaxrees> heh?
[15:24:54] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/4smacore/3/  well i mean, this seems to work.  ?
[15:25:48] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:27:28] <ceramicskull> Did I add more than necessary? taplar
[15:27:48] <taplar> I'm just wondering what issue you have with this that you are trying to ask us about
[15:28:17] <taplar> Cause as you can see from that link, it changed the /blog to /inside-blog, and added the query param
[15:28:32] <ceramicskull> OMG
[15:28:51] <ceramicskull> robertmaxrees I'm sorry, I thought I re-posted the question in ##javascript
[15:28:51] <taplar> soooo.....
[15:29:01] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:30:11] <robertmaxrees> you see taplar's suggestion?
[15:30:32] <robertmaxrees> and question
[15:30:37] <ceramicskull> taplar it wasn't redirecting example.com/blog
[15:30:41] <ceramicskull> prior
[15:30:53] <taplar> well you have to put it back in the location.url to do the redirect
[15:31:01] <taplar> all that is doing to creating the url string
[15:31:10] <taplar> err, location.href
[15:33:17] <ceramicskull> Yea, it was working fine with /blog/example-title , just never /blog
[15:34:11] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/4smacore/7/  ?
[16:24:04] <taplar> heh, i'm obsessed
[16:24:58] <taplar> i found a 3d minecraft block builder app that saves the model as json, but creating blocks is kinda a pain.  so i wrote a script to generate json
[16:25:18] <taplar> and then i started modifying stuff and blocks got out of order in the json, so then i wrote a script to sort the blocks.
[16:25:25] * taplar wanders around aimlessly
[16:26:39] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[16:27:38] <robertmaxrees> get after it!
[16:27:49] <taplar> ^_^
[16:38:33] <debron> hello. Wanted to ask: how to select #2 , from #4 , with jquery selectors?  <div><div><span></span><span #2>text!</span></div><div><img #4 /></div></div>
[16:39:11] <taplar> #2 doesn't belong to #4. ?
[16:39:43] <debron> ?
[16:40:02] <taplar> saying to select something "from" something else implies one is a parent
[16:40:06] <debron> no, 4 its an image, 2 its a span, they are not children of the same parent, not directly
[16:40:23] <taplar> right, so your phrasing is not clear towards what you are after
[16:40:29] <debron> no, i mean, from $("#4)....
[16:40:48] <debron> taplar
[16:40:54] <debron> comeon dude
[16:40:58] <taplar> try phrasing it without using the word "from"
[16:41:14] <debron> from off
[16:41:16] <debron> xD
[16:41:38] <taplar> do you want to select element 2 and 4?
[16:41:43] <debron> when you want to go some place , from some other place, its right, isnt it?
[16:41:46] <debron> then this case should work
[16:41:55] <debron> might be not perfect
[16:41:58] <debron> but works for me
[16:42:00] <debron> if you cant understand me
[16:42:02] <taplar> that analogy reflects a flat plane
[16:42:06] <debron> (im sure you did)
[16:42:07] <taplar> a dom is a tree
[16:42:11] <debron> but you are not my english teacher
[16:42:16] <debron> and i would appreciate some correction
[16:42:19] <debron> but not that attitude
[16:42:20] <taplar> so to say from one thing to another, you have to explain what you mean
[16:42:50] <taplar> this isn't attitude.  i don't understand what you are after
[16:43:01] <debron> I used a visual example
[16:43:06] <debron> you understood it perfectly
[16:43:19] <taplar> it doesn't make sense compared to what you are asking
[16:43:38] <taplar> the two elements are not directly related, so saying to go from one to another doesn't make sense
[16:43:59] <debron> it has talking about jquery selector
[16:44:15] <debron> in that matter it has sense
[16:44:49] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/eg3yodw7/   so which elements do you want to select?
[16:44:58] <debron> just one?
[16:45:03] <debron> element #2
[16:45:11] <debron> hello. Wanted to ask: how to select #2 , from #4 , with jquery selectors?  <div><div><span></span><span #2>text!</span></div><div><img #4 /></div></div>
[16:45:19] <taplar> you don't have to repeat it
[16:45:29] <debron> origin = #4 , target = #2
[16:45:40] <debron> whats the nonsense?
[16:45:51] <taplar> so you want the span of 2, it's parent div, the sibling div, and the child img?
[16:46:11] <debron> i just want to reference the span #2, as i wrote
[16:46:31] <debron> to get the text inside
[16:46:39] <taplar> if you want to find the span of two then that's just 'div > div >span:nth-child(2)'
[16:46:54] <taplar> or (1), i forget if nth-child is 0 based or not
[16:47:25] <debron> but first i would need to reference #4 parent
[16:47:36] <taplar> ???  #4 isn't a parent of #2
[16:47:36] <debron> right?
[16:47:41] <debron> so what
[16:48:00] <taplar> so i don't understand what your problem is.  what the starting point of your issue is
[16:48:02] <debron> all i know at that execution point is where is #4
[16:48:04] <debron> so from there
[16:48:08] <debron> i need to reference 2
[16:48:13] <taplar> ok, so you have a reference of 4 already?
[16:48:18] <debron> yes
[16:48:23] <taplar> there we go!
[16:48:27] <debron> pfff..
[16:48:33] <debron> great actuation hahah
[16:48:45] <debron> ok then, lets go to the deal now you want to collaborate
[16:48:53] <taplar> have a good day dude.
[16:48:57] <debron> :D
[16:49:00] <debron> you too
[16:49:25] <debron> i find people that act exactly the same way as you did today with me
[16:49:29] <debron> every day 1 different one
[16:49:44] <debron> minimun!!
[16:50:45] <debron> you have to understand that people that doesnt speak english often (not even once a month) doesnt have a perfect english level, and we still uses technologies and sometimes want to chat, or to ask about something
[16:50:55] <debron> if you cant be tolerant, please, keep it to yourself
[16:51:05] <taplar> and you have to understand that i'm asking questions to understand your issue
[16:51:06] <debron> you just lost a bunch of time, and made me lose mine
[16:51:08] <taplar> it's not attitude
[16:51:29] <debron> taplar: i told you, this is not the first time i see that attitude (not even close)
[16:51:30] <taplar> i can't help you if i don't understand your issue
[16:52:37] <taplar> so for instance with this question.  you are asking how to find 2, if you have a reference of 4
[16:52:58] <debron> yeah I think its exactly as you said
[16:53:08] <debron> have a reference of #4
[16:53:26] <debron> and need to reference span #2, so I can get the text inside it
[16:53:34] <taplar> right, so that's the kind of question you want to ask.  it clearly says what you have and what you want
[16:53:59] <debron> I though it was clear the first time, but ok then, if this is better, this way
[16:54:17] <taplar> ok, so the first thing you can do is use the parent() method
[16:54:27] <taplar> this will find the parent element of an element
[16:54:54] <debron> #4.parent().find(".#2") should do the job?
[16:55:01] <debron> if .2 span has a class name
[16:55:06] <debron> that i could use?
[16:55:12] <taplar> the parent of the #4 is a sibling to the parent of the span
[16:55:25] <taplar> so from that parent, you can then use prev() to go back to the previous sibling
[16:55:43] <debron> let me translate sibling
[16:55:59] <taplar> elements that belong to the same element
[16:56:07] <debron> its like "brother"
[16:56:08] <debron> ok
[16:56:11] <taplar> <div><p></p></p></div>
[16:56:15] <taplar> the p tags are siblings
[16:56:22] <taplar> crap, typo
[16:56:25] <debron> ok i got it
[16:56:28] <taplar> <div><p></p><p></p></div>
[16:56:33] <debron> yeah
[16:57:27] <debron> prev will not work nicely
[16:57:38] <debron> because i didnt used the complete example, sorry
[16:57:46] <debron> there are more elements before
[16:57:56] <debron> i would need to do... .prev().prev().prev()
[16:58:01] <taplar> ok, can you show me an example that reflects your actual case?
[16:58:12] <debron> is there something more straight? like going to the first child element of the parent of both?
[16:58:25] <taplar> if the elements had classes on them, it would be much easier
[16:58:30] <debron> yeah, give me a moment
[16:58:37] <debron> yeah they do have classes
[16:58:46] <debron> at least some of them, not all
[16:58:53] <taplar> ok, so does a parent of both of them have a class some where?
[16:59:00] <debron> yeah
[16:59:13] <taplar> ok, so first step you can use closest('.thatparentclass')
[16:59:28] <taplar> this will look though the parents of the element to find one with that class
[16:59:52] <taplar> from there, if you have a class you can use to find the #2, you can find('.thatotherclass') off of that result
[17:00:19] <debron> #4.parent().find(".#2")
[17:00:22] <debron> that wouldnt work?
[17:00:53] <debron> forget about syntax, just the idea
[17:00:58] <taplar> $(reference-to-#4).closest('.class-on-a-shared-parent').find('selector-for-#2')
[17:01:11] <debron> ok
[17:02:15] <debron> and closes will look backward and not forward? im afraid it goes to the next parent of both... because there are more consecutive, $(reference-to-#4).parent()  wouldnt do that? Its weird
[17:02:47] <debron> i mean, instead of $(reference-to-#4).closest('.class-on-a-shared-parent').find('selector-for-#2')
[17:02:54] <taplar> it first looks at itself for a match, then looks at it's immediate parent, then that elements parent, and on and on, returning the first match
[17:02:57] <debron> why not $(reference-to-#4).parent().find('selector-for-#2')
[17:03:12] <debron> ahh okay
[17:03:21] <debron> like "from the inside to the outside, the closest"
[17:03:22] <taplar> because, at least from the markup you showed me, #2 is not a child of the parent of #4
[17:03:25] <taplar> yes
[17:03:51] <debron> ah thats right, #2 its inside another parent
[17:04:03] <debron> okay, thanks you very much taplar
[17:04:09] <taplar> np man
[17:04:48] <debron> excuse me if my manners wasnt good.. having a stressfull couple of weeks
[17:04:55] <debron> stressful*
[17:05:53] <taplar> it's ok.  i just wanted to make sure i understood what you needed, before I started trying to answer a question you didn't ask.  i'm sorry if that came off as confrontational
[17:07:56] <debron> it's allright, thanks again :) you just teached me something important about jquery
[17:08:44] <debron> or taught*
[17:08:47] <taplar> awesome.  feel free to swing by any time.  hopefully we can help you avoid some of the people who you find are intolerant
[17:09:19] <taplar> though, as you can see, we can all get snippy at times, ^_^
[17:09:37] <robertmaxrees> oof
[17:09:56] <debron> yeah, maybe thats a way better adjetive for that situation
[17:10:04] <debron> :)
[17:15:32] <sixfingeredamish> hi there
[17:15:49] <taplar> hola
[17:15:54] <robertmaxrees> hello
[17:15:59] <sixfingeredamish> Can I get some help with Jquery here?
[17:16:07] <taplar> we can try, :)
[17:16:45] <robertmaxrees> this IS the jQuery channel soooo
[17:16:52] <robertmaxrees> :B
[17:17:25] <sixfingeredamish> Thanks!
[17:19:23] <sixfingeredamish> What I'm trying to do is have an image change every time I hover over a different <h2>
[17:19:24] <sixfingeredamish> https://gist.github.com/SixFingeredAmish/53d2eedfe9779ae6ea22947cb747e19a
[17:20:00] <taplar> $("this") <-- take the quotes off
[17:20:15] <sixfingeredamish> I'm trying to do it by storing img url in the html data attribute, then fetching it and using it to replace img url on hover
[17:20:17] <taplar> this is a special word referencing the context of a function
[17:20:19] <robertmaxrees> also I might use mouseenter for the event, instead of 'hover'
[17:21:07] <taplar> and use data('image-url') rather than the attr method
[17:21:38] <taplar> $('#tv').attr("src","url"); <-- and take the quotes off of url
[17:21:49] <taplar> url is a variable containing the string
[17:23:11] <sixfingeredamish> ok, changed all that!
[17:23:24] <taplar> any questions about that?
[17:23:31] <sixfingeredamish> I'm getting an $ is not defined error
[17:23:39] <taplar> make sure you include jquery on your page
[17:23:41] <robertmaxrees> then you're not including jquery.
[17:24:37] <sixfingeredamish> do you recommending loading jquery in <head>?
[17:24:47] <sixfingeredamish> recommend*
[17:24:49] <robertmaxrees> depends.
[17:25:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess your page is pretty small, so it won't really matter much for your case.
[17:25:25] <robertmaxrees> just so long as it's before your code.
[17:26:46] <sixfingeredamish> I got it working! THANK YOU
[17:26:54] <robertmaxrees> awesome :)
[17:27:06] <robertmaxrees> you understand all of those changes?
[17:27:11] <sixfingeredamish> for mouse exit I just rewrite the function again right? It's not like an if/else thing
[17:27:28] <robertmaxrees> mouseleave
[17:27:28] <sixfingeredamish> I understand, thank you for notating them. It was most me putting variables in strings?
[17:27:43] <taplar> mostly, yeah
[17:30:24] <sixfingeredamish> If I want something to execute 2 seconds after mouse leave, I would just put setTimeout(function() { something;} 2000);
[17:30:42] <taplar> sure
[17:31:03] <taplar> however, keep in mind that each one of those elements will have a mouseleave
[17:31:08] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:31:29] <taplar> ideally i would suggest putting those elements inside a wrapper, and bind that mouseleave on that wrapper
[17:32:27] <sixfingeredamish> ah i get what you mean
[17:37:31] <sixfingeredamish> Got it working :D
[17:42:52] <sixfingeredamish> http://recordit.co/SaZwXQWmxH
[17:42:55] <sixfingeredamish> Thanks everyone!
[17:45:42] <robertmaxrees> awesome
[22:11:45] <kevr> jquery.datetimepicker.js seems to be broken
[22:11:49] <kevr> is there a good alternative around?
[22:15:40] <spaces> why is it broken ?
[22:25:10] <kevr> Because it has no embedded formatDate/parseDate functions, and apparently its supposed to have defaults, none of the doc says anything about it, but many stackoverflow threads do
[22:25:25] <kevr> and i'm not going to hack together some shit to fix this if there is a more viable jquery dtpicker around
[22:30:23] <kevr> Do you have an actual answer or are you just asking me that?
[22:46:38] <kevr> Cool :)
