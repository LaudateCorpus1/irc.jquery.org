[06:48:34] <vish93> Heyy would anyone here be ofay with the Slick Carousel?
[07:50:45] <jak2000> how to focus an TextArea?
[07:50:58] <Cork> just call .focus()
[07:53:05] <jak2000> thx
[09:59:13] <snatcher> const p1 = new Promise((res, rej) => { res(1); }); const p2 = function(v) { return new Promise((res, rej) => { res(1*v); }); };
[09:59:17] <snatcher> p1.then((v1) => $.when(p1, p2(v1))).then((v1, v2) => console.log(v1, v2));
[09:59:25] <snatcher> why v2 is undefined?
[10:03:20] <undefined_bob> I'm undefined :3
[11:44:04] <shoky_> snatcher: because you're mixing native Promise's and jquery Deffereds.  https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.0/#callback-invocation    "If you mix other Promises/A+ implementations with jQuery's, you may only receive a single argument in your handler. "
[11:44:41] <shoky_> snatcher: if you just move one ) in your code to the end, it will work as you expect.  p1.then((v1) => $.when(p1, p2(v1)).then((v1, v2) => console.log(v1, v2)));
[11:46:14] <shoky_> (assuming jquery 3.x)
[15:15:19] <jax> hello
[15:15:45] <jax> i'm found an element with name: id_description_de_container and now i'm trying to find all elements like id_description_WHATEVER_container
[15:15:47] <jax> how can i find those?
[15:16:02] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle with some example markup?
[15:19:49] <robertmaxrees> jax that way i can see what you're working with
[15:34:55] <jax> ah i got it
[15:35:33] <jax> [id^="id_description"][id$='_description']
[15:36:03] <robertmaxrees> :|
[15:36:10] <robertmaxrees> why not just give them a class?
[15:41:02] <jax> cus i'm not the one creating them :D
[15:41:24] <robertmaxrees> then add them?
[21:58:23] <primitivMedia> anybody here used pagination.min.js before? I'm having issues
[21:58:30] <primitivMedia> keeps telling me pagination is not a function
[21:58:46] <robertmaxrees> can share the code and see if we can't help.
[21:58:49] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle would be best.
[21:59:23] <primitivMedia> i used jquery.noconflict()
[21:59:27] <primitivMedia> now i get jquery not defined
[21:59:39] <robertmaxrees> without the code there's nothing we can do to help
[21:59:46] <robertmaxrees> we need to see what you're working with.
[22:00:45] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/nlUx
[22:01:09] <robertmaxrees> how are you loading pagination?
[22:01:12] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/YlU2
[22:01:18] <primitivMedia> above the script tag in the header
[22:01:22] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[22:01:27] <robertmaxrees> so it's a local file?
[22:01:33] <primitivMedia> yes why?
[22:01:36] <primitivMedia> is that bad?
[22:01:39] <robertmaxrees> is it published anywhere?
[22:01:42] <primitivMedia> https://pagination.js.org/dist/2.1.4/pagination.min.js
[22:01:44] <primitivMedia> here
[22:01:47] <primitivMedia> should i use this instead
[22:01:50] <robertmaxrees> can you just setup a jsfiddle?
[22:02:06] <robertmaxrees> also: are you loading your js before or after pagination?
[22:02:09] <primitivMedia> not really it's a php web app
[22:02:12] <robertmaxrees> is the pagination file 404ing?
[22:02:17] <robertmaxrees> you can actually.
[22:02:19] <primitivMedia> js is loaded before
[22:02:22] <robertmaxrees> you just need the rendered html.
[22:02:32] <robertmaxrees> so your js is loaded before the pagination file?
[22:03:10] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you using noconflict?
[22:03:36] <primitivMedia> pagination.js is called at the end of the file
[22:03:40] <primitivMedia> js is calledd above
[22:03:43] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[22:03:51] <robertmaxrees> pagination isn't defined yet.
[22:03:59] <robertmaxrees> your code has to come after the plugin
[22:04:08] <robertmaxrees> and kill the noconflict.
[22:04:11] <robertmaxrees> that's also causing issues.
[22:04:42] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/ihzl
[22:04:43] <primitivMedia> here
[22:06:01] <robertmaxrees> can you share the rendered html instead?
[22:06:14] <robertmaxrees> since js (and subsequently jquery) don't interact with the php at all.
[22:07:03] <primitivMedia> okay so putting pagination above the code gives me dikfferent errors
[22:07:08] <primitivMedia> now it says pagination requires jquery
[22:07:11] <robertmaxrees> right.
[22:07:18] <robertmaxrees> you need to load jquery, then pagination, then your code.
[22:08:46] <primitivMedia> Uncaught TypeError: $(...).pagination is not a function
[22:08:52] <primitivMedia> thats what i get after  did that order
[22:09:00] <robertmaxrees> do you still have the noconflict in your file?
[22:09:19] <primitivMedia> nope removed
[22:09:32] <robertmaxrees> and no 404s or anything in your network tab?
[22:10:45] <primitivMedia> nope
[22:10:52] <robertmaxrees> then i'd have to see it.
[22:10:57] <primitivMedia> cani pm you
[22:10:59] <robertmaxrees> the actual rendered html.
[22:11:07] <robertmaxrees> i'd rather you didn't.
[22:11:21] <primitivMedia> well i would need you to login to my platform and dont feel like giving everybody access
[22:11:27] <robertmaxrees> i'd rather you not do that :)
[22:11:34] <robertmaxrees> since that opens me up to liability.
[22:11:40] <robertmaxrees> why not just give me the rendered page?
[22:11:41] <primitivMedia> oh you wouldnt have any provileges
[22:11:46] <primitivMedia> just to the section i have issues with
[22:11:51] <primitivMedia> no sensitive data
[22:11:52] <robertmaxrees> i don't need access to anything.  just the html.
[22:12:51] <robertmaxrees> or, even better, a test case in jsfiddle.
[22:14:03] <primitivMedia> https://pastebin.com/9Gg74AiV
[22:15:38] <robertmaxrees> why are you loading jquery twice?
[22:16:41] <robertmaxrees> that's your issue.  load jquery once.  problem solved.
[22:18:37] <primitivMedia> AHHHHH
[22:18:40] <primitivMedia> i removed the duplicate jquery
[22:18:47] <primitivMedia> thank you mate
[22:18:53] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[22:35:29] <primitivMedia> pagination.min.js:11 Uncaught Error: Pagination: The parameter of "done" Function should be an Array. this is what im getting now
[22:35:42] <robertmaxrees> show your js.
[22:36:05] <primitivMedia> https://pastebin.com/uw6v3TG8
[22:36:12] <primitivMedia> so I'm using ajax to get the data
[22:36:23] <primitivMedia> https://pagination.js.org/docs/index.html#dataSource
[22:37:02] <robertmaxrees> what's the format of the data coming back from the ajax call?
[22:37:06] <primitivMedia> https://pastebin.com/MHZq421f
[22:37:18] <primitivMedia> it is stuffing all emails retrieved into an array
[22:37:33] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[22:37:37] <robertmaxrees> i don't do php heh
[22:37:46] <robertmaxrees> can you share an example of the actual data coming back?
[22:38:01] <primitivMedia> var dump or print r work?
[22:38:07] <robertmaxrees> no.
[22:38:19] <robertmaxrees> console.log(response); <- do this.
[22:39:48] <robertmaxrees> and before that do a console.log(typeof response);
[22:39:57] <primitivMedia> it returns blank nothing
[22:40:12] <robertmaxrees> it's in the success of the ajax call, right?
[22:40:22] <robertmaxrees> just before done(response);?
[22:40:57] <primitivMedia> ys i put the console log there
[22:41:03] <robertmaxrees> then there's your issue.
[22:41:16] <primitivMedia> my php isnt outputting any data
[22:41:21] <robertmaxrees> right.
[22:41:21] <primitivMedia> its sotring everything into an array
[22:41:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:41:31] <primitivMedia> console log will never return anything
[22:41:31] <robertmaxrees> your php needs to return data.
[22:41:40] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[22:41:43] <robertmaxrees> i think you're confused.
[22:41:43] <primitivMedia> You can also send a request to get data, invoke done to return the data source.
[22:41:47] <primitivMedia> they are using a .json file
[22:41:58] <primitivMedia> if i return anassociative array ould that work
[22:42:00] <robertmaxrees> you realize that the JS and PHP don't interact, right?
[22:42:12] <robertmaxrees> and not really.  you need to output a JSON array.
[22:44:15] <robertmaxrees> you need to setup an endpoint that will return that data.
[22:45:01] <primitivMedia> ["nicolas@primitiv.media","bobby@primitiv.media"]
[22:45:07] <primitivMedia> is what the console now returns
[22:45:13] <robertmaxrees> and the typeof?
[22:45:23] <primitivMedia> what do you mean?
[22:45:38] <robertmaxrees> scroll up
[22:45:48] <robertmaxrees> <robertmaxrees> and before that do a console.log(typeof response);
[22:46:31] <primitivMedia> string
[22:46:51] <robertmaxrees> so you're returning JSON - that means you need to parse the data before you pass it to done()
[22:47:08] <robertmaxrees> var theData = JSON.parse(response);  done(theData);
[22:47:50] <primitivMedia> WOOOOOHHHOOOOO
[22:47:57] <primitivMedia> it finally works, thank you a bunch mate
[22:48:12] <robertmaxrees> do you understand everything you just did?
[22:48:12] <primitivMedia> what exactly is the parse doing?
[22:48:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[22:48:30] <robertmaxrees> so you're sending back JSON, which is a string.
[22:48:47] <robertmaxrees> but you need it to be a javascript object.
[22:48:52] <robertmaxrees> JSON.parse does that job.
[22:49:02] <primitivMedia> ahh okay that makese sense
[22:49:40] <robertmaxrees> does the error about arrays make more sense?
[22:51:12] <primitivMedia> yes, 1 i wasnt outputtimg data just storing it
[22:51:25] <primitivMedia> 2. i wasnt parsing
[22:51:27] <robertmaxrees> sorta, yeah.
[22:51:34] <primitivMedia> there was more to it
[22:51:48] <primitivMedia> can i use GET instead of POST
[22:51:51] <primitivMedia> in the ajax?
[22:52:07] <robertmaxrees> depends on your server.
[22:52:14] <robertmaxrees> will it support a get to that endpoint?>
[22:53:34] <robertmaxrees> a get would make a lot more sense.
[22:54:28] <primitivMedia> it should
[22:54:47] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to checl
[22:54:50] <robertmaxrees> *check
[22:55:50] <robertmaxrees> bbiab
[23:04:36] <primitivMedia> now im getting template is not defined not too sure why
[23:16:15] <primitivMedia> really no clue why its there
[23:20:37] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia sooooo what do you think i'ma ask?
[23:21:19] <primitivMedia> https://pastebin.com/KDBdqMsF
[23:21:36] <robertmaxrees> so look at your code.
[23:21:54] <robertmaxrees> if it says template isn't defined, why do you think that is?
[23:22:10] <primitivMedia> I'm not sure the docs do not specify hat to do with templatw
[23:22:14] <primitivMedia> do i need to create a function?
[23:22:19] <robertmaxrees> link again to the docs?
[23:22:33] <primitivMedia> https://pagination.js.org/docs/index.html
[23:22:51] <robertmaxrees> to the part about the ajax stuff?
[23:23:33] <primitivMedia> poardon?
[23:23:43] <robertmaxrees> to the specific part of the docs about the stuff you're doing here.
[23:24:08] <primitivMedia> https://pagination.js.org/index.html#format_navigator
[23:24:43] <robertmaxrees> https://pagination.js.org/docs/index.html#formatNavigator
[23:24:46] <robertmaxrees> ^
[23:24:52] <robertmaxrees> stop just copy/pasting examples.
[23:24:57] <robertmaxrees> the docs explain exactly what to do :)
[23:25:46] <primitivMedia> im consfued
[23:25:51] <primitivMedia> confused*
[23:26:19] <robertmaxrees> about?
[23:27:37] <primitivMedia> that doesnt help me define template
[23:27:38] <primitivMedia> look
[23:27:38] <robertmaxrees> you're on the example for format navigator, but you need details about what all you need to do.
[23:27:42] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware.
[23:27:49] <robertmaxrees> you need to actually read the documentation.
[23:27:57] <primitivMedia> https://pastebin.com/UwUPAyXh
[23:28:13] <primitivMedia> the examples are supposed to work just like that...
[23:28:19] <robertmaxrees> no.
[23:28:23] <primitivMedia> thats wh ythe give you different variations...
[23:28:45] <robertmaxrees> you're misunderstanding the docs and examples.
[23:29:04] <robertmaxrees> template isn't a magiic function that exists.  you have to define it.
[23:29:12] <robertmaxrees> or just implement it in that callback.
[23:29:12] <primitivMedia> okay and what do i put inside
[23:29:21] <primitivMedia> the docs dont specify this
[23:29:22] <primitivMedia> or what to put
[23:30:08] <robertmaxrees> did you actually read the docs or are you just copy/pasting things?
[23:30:29] <primitivMedia> i am reading
[23:30:38] <primitivMedia> i do not understand what to put
[23:30:48] <robertmaxrees> when it says "// template method of yourself", what do you think that means?
[23:31:21] <primitivMedia> okay but what do i put inside...
[23:31:27] <primitivMedia> tjhat's my concern
[23:31:42] <robertmaxrees> i have no way of knowing - i don't know what the markup should be.
[23:31:54] <primitivMedia> me either
[23:31:58] <primitivMedia> thats what im trying to understand
[23:31:59] <robertmaxrees> you should
[23:32:01] <robertmaxrees> it's your page.
[23:32:02] <primitivMedia> the docs do not specify
[23:32:24] <primitivMedia> what would an example of the template method look like
[23:32:39] <robertmaxrees> do a console.log(data) in that callback.
[23:32:45] <robertmaxrees> comment out everything else.
[23:32:53] <primitivMedia> it will return 2 emails
[23:32:55] <primitivMedia> thats it
[23:32:58] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[23:33:17] <robertmaxrees> so what do you want to do with those 2 emails?
[23:33:23] <primitivMedia> just display them
[23:33:35] <primitivMedia> once i have my records ill go about the rest afterwarda
[23:33:40] <primitivMedia> but for now i cant even see them
[23:33:44] <robertmaxrees> check out https://pagination.js.org/docs/index.html#callback
[23:33:50] <robertmaxrees> this should help you better understand.
[23:34:00] <primitivMedia> ive read this over and over
[23:34:05] <primitivMedia> it does not tell me what goes inside
[23:34:15] <robertmaxrees> "Callback of each paging. Useful for processing the result data before rendered."
[23:34:15] <primitivMedia> i do not understand what the template method is doing
[23:34:35] <robertmaxrees> do you need to process the result data before it's rendered?
[23:34:45] <primitivMedia> im just trying to display it
[23:34:47] <primitivMedia> nothing else
[23:34:57] <robertmaxrees> is the callback a required parameter?
[23:35:07] <primitivMedia> i belive so yesss
[23:35:18] <robertmaxrees> believe or know?
[23:35:20] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[23:35:35] <primitivMedia> it does not tell me
[23:35:37] <primitivMedia> idk
[23:35:46] <primitivMedia> what do i put inside template
[23:35:49] <robertmaxrees> dude
[23:35:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[23:35:55] <robertmaxrees> good luck.
[23:36:15] <primitivMedia> i do not understand dude what kind of js code goes in it
[23:36:19] <primitivMedia> they do not tell me
[23:36:26] <robertmaxrees> setup a test case at least.
[23:36:28] <robertmaxrees> i can do more then.
[23:36:39] <robertmaxrees> until then, I don't know how to help you.  the docs are pretty straightforward.
[23:36:51] <primitivMedia> does template(eat dog shit) work? im geniunely confused as to what goes inside
[23:36:55] <primitivMedia> im not joking
[23:36:58] <primitivMedia> i kiterally DO NOT KNOW
[23:36:59] <robertmaxrees> neither am i.
[23:37:02] <primitivMedia> what kind of code
[23:37:04] <primitivMedia> can you help me
[23:37:06] <robertmaxrees> make a functional jsfiddle.
[23:37:08] <robertmaxrees> and i can help.
[23:37:10] <primitivMedia> im not asking u to format how it will be outputted
[23:37:16] <primitivMedia> i just want them to to show
[23:37:52] <primitivMedia> can you show me what it tells me to put in the method in the docs
[23:37:56] <primitivMedia> you swwm to understand
[23:37:58] <primitivMedia> but cannot tell me
[23:38:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to repeat myself.
[23:38:11] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle, then i will help.
[23:38:49] <primitivMedia> i do not know how to use fiddle
[23:38:52] <primitivMedia> it's 3 am
[23:38:56] <primitivMedia> I am extremely tired
[23:39:03] <robertmaxrees> you're burning yourself out.
[23:39:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd get some sleep.
[23:39:09] <primitivMedia> i do not have X hours to spend learning it
[23:39:19] <primitivMedia> i just need me records to show then i can do the rest
[23:39:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[23:40:12] <primitivMedia> its not funny mate
[23:40:18] <primitivMedia> not even close
[23:40:27] <robertmaxrees> drop the attitude homie.
[23:40:39] <primitivMedia> there is not ONE EXAMPLE of how the function or method is supposed to look
[23:40:45] <primitivMedia> idk how im supposed to know what goes inside
[23:40:52] <primitivMedia> based off the docs that do not explain anything
[23:41:05] <primitivMedia> so please if you understand what to put inside then explain it to me
[23:41:14] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle and i can help you learn it.
[23:42:51] <primitivMedia> no idea what to put in it
[23:42:55] <primitivMedia> never used it
[23:42:58] <primitivMedia> idk how this is going to work
[23:43:23] <primitivMedia> its impossible to grab the php results from js fiddle
[23:43:27] <primitivMedia> i do not understand how to use it
[23:43:29] <primitivMedia> i never have
[23:43:37] <primitivMedia> can you just tell me
[23:43:43] <primitivMedia> i do not need a fiddle to understand
[23:44:14] <robertmaxrees> from what I can tell, it wants you to take the data and format it and put it onto the pake yourself.
[23:44:17] <primitivMedia> https://jsfiddle.net/7nwocz0e/
[23:44:17] <robertmaxrees> like... that's all.
[23:44:19] <primitivMedia> here you go
[23:44:23] <primitivMedia> no clue if this is right but here you go
[23:44:55] <robertmaxrees> so how do you want the data itself to display?
[23:45:23] <primitivMedia> by text
[23:45:28] <robertmaxrees> ...
[23:45:28] <primitivMedia> the emails one on top of the other
[23:45:32] <primitivMedia> idk what youre asking me
[23:45:36] <primitivMedia> i just need them to show idc how
[23:45:46] <primitivMedia> idc the order the format
[23:45:49] <primitivMedia> i just need the emails to show
[23:45:50] <robertmaxrees> so the template function is going to take the data and hand it to you.
[23:46:03] <robertmaxrees> then you use javascript to convert that into whatever you want.  html, a string, whatever.
[23:46:16] <robertmaxrees> and then you append that yourself to the page.
[23:46:23] <primitivMedia> still no clue what to put in
[23:46:28] <primitivMedia> i do not understand
[23:46:36] <robertmaxrees> what about what i just said isn't clear?
[23:46:40] <primitivMedia> bro
[23:46:45] <primitivMedia> i get what youre sayuing
[23:46:46] <primitivMedia> BUT
[23:46:48] <robertmaxrees> then do it?
[23:46:50] <primitivMedia> that does not tell me what to put inside it
[23:46:53] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're trying at least.
[23:46:59] <primitivMedia> nothing its blank
[23:47:03] <primitivMedia> i do not know what to put
[23:47:06] <primitivMedia> idk how else to say it
[23:47:20] <robertmaxrees> you need to define a function named "template"
[23:47:24] <primitivMedia> i do not understand how to create a template function to handle the data
[23:47:30] <primitivMedia> idk wtf that means or how to do it
[23:47:33] <primitivMedia> what goesi nside
[23:47:37] <primitivMedia> do i have a loop?
[23:47:40] <primitivMedia> do i create var?
[23:47:50] <robertmaxrees> do you understand how to create html using javascript?
[23:47:52] <primitivMedia> i do not understand sadly how to format or create this magical function out of thin air
[23:48:02] <primitivMedia> using jquery to change the html sure
[23:48:14] <robertmaxrees> create html using javascript.
[23:48:34] <robertmaxrees> like - how would you take an array and create a bunch of <li>s?
[23:48:40] <primitivMedia>  template function (){
[23:48:47] <primitivMedia> is this how i define it?
[23:49:08] <robertmaxrees> do you not know how to write a function in javascript?
[23:50:07] <primitivMedia> or do i do template: function (){} ?
[23:50:17] <robertmaxrees> neither of those.
[23:50:33] <robertmaxrees> declare a normal ol' function called template
[23:50:43] <primitivMedia> https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp
[23:50:48] <primitivMedia> like this example?
[23:50:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[23:50:57] <robertmaxrees> but name it "template"
[23:51:22] <primitivMedia> okay
[23:51:31] <robertmaxrees> so now
[23:51:37] <robertmaxrees> it needs to accept one argument.
[23:51:41] <primitivMedia> data?
[23:51:44] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[23:51:46] <robertmaxrees> name it whatever.
[23:51:50] <primitivMedia> ok done
[23:51:57] <robertmaxrees> show me what you've got so far?
[23:52:00] <robertmaxrees> in that fiddle.
[23:52:21] <primitivMedia> idk how to edit it or save
[23:52:25] <primitivMedia> i dont see a  button
[23:52:34] <robertmaxrees> at the top.
[23:52:36] <robertmaxrees> says "save"
[23:52:55] <primitivMedia> i do not see anything at the top
[23:52:58] <primitivMedia> has HTML box
[23:52:59] <primitivMedia> no menu
[23:53:11] <robertmaxrees> close and reopen.
[23:53:25] <primitivMedia> ahh
[23:53:28] <primitivMedia> hitting "enter"
[23:53:29] <primitivMedia> saves
[23:53:33] <primitivMedia> when no save button is present
[23:53:37] <robertmaxrees> wat
[23:53:40] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't.
[23:53:44] <robertmaxrees> anyway - new link?
[23:53:47] <primitivMedia> https://jsfiddle.net/7nwocz0e/3/
[23:54:15] <robertmaxrees> almost - makes more sense to do
[23:54:16] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9ek6u1sf/
[23:55:08] <primitivMedia> ?? i dont see anything different
[23:55:16] <primitivMedia> oh its at the top
[23:55:21] <robertmaxrees> so now.
[23:55:32] <primitivMedia> return(data) ?
[23:55:36] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[23:55:44] <robertmaxrees> you need to transform the data into the html you want.
[23:55:56] <robertmaxrees> and that's not how you return from a js function.
[23:57:14] <primitivMedia> so what do i put in the middle now?
[23:57:31] <robertmaxrees> depends!  what html do you want to end up with?
[23:57:37] <robertmaxrees> to append into the page.
[23:57:46] <primitivMedia> idk, ul li
[23:57:52] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[23:58:15] <robertmaxrees> so you want a UL on the page that you can append to - so make a static UL on the page and give it a unique ID.
[23:58:58] <primitivMedia> https://jsfiddle.net/4dxb0m36/
[23:59:08] <robertmaxrees> you'll need that because you also have dataContainer.html(html); in the callback - also gotta define dataContainer :)
[23:59:24] <robertmaxrees> you don't want that ul in the div.
[23:59:28] <robertmaxrees> put it before or after.
[23:59:31] <primitivMedia> ahh ok
[23:59:42] <primitivMedia> https://jsfiddle.net/4dxb0m36/1/
[23:59:55] <robertmaxrees> do you want the pagination to show up above the data?
