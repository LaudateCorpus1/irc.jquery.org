[00:22:35] <Neo1> hi
[06:31:44] <Amrbinniyaz[m]> http://amrbinniyaz.com/
[09:45:41] <woodrag> when i display a hidden td width colspan=7 it display only with  colspan=1 what do i need to do to display it correctly?
[09:52:42] <Cork> woodrag: how are you hiding it?
[09:53:16] <woodrag> display:none
[09:53:23] <woodrag> cork: display:none
[09:53:44] <Cork> woodrag: you most likely can't
[09:54:10] <woodrag> cork: why?
[09:54:23] <Cork> tables has a lot of complex codes for tables and colspan is one of those that isn't fully specked in css
[09:58:59] <Cork> hmm
[09:59:11] <Cork> woodrag: what exactly is the problem? this works fine for me https://jsfiddle.net/udc6xww2/
[10:00:43] <woodrag> Cork: Thank you will try this...
[10:02:16] <quio3> Hi, I have console logged out something I want to read as code
[10:02:37] <quio3> var ReadIt = all.filter(getFilter("filterSubject")).filter(getFilter("filterTypeOfSchool")).filter(getFilter("filterTargetGroup"));
[10:03:02] <quio3> but when Im use ReadIt, it not reads as code
[10:03:15] <Cork> quio3: i don't get the question
[10:03:23] <Cork> you mean you want the code instead of the result or...?
[10:03:44] <quio3> I want to put my result into the code :P
[10:03:51] <Cork> in what code
[10:04:34] <Cork> ReadIt will contain the result the function .filter(getFilter("filterTargetGroup")) returns
[10:04:39] <Cork> no code at
[10:04:42] <Cork> -att
[10:05:02] <quio3> will try one more time
[10:05:06] <quio3> :)
[10:05:11] <quio3> brb
[10:05:15] <Cork> ok?
[10:32:40] <Ben_1> I''m searching for a element with find(#element_id) and afterwards I'm using elem.attr('id') to check the id. When I output elem.attr('id') it returns undefined, how could that be the case?
[10:33:15] <Cork> Ben_1: and elem.length > 0?
[10:34:09] <Ben_1> Cork: one moment please I will check that.
[10:34:18] <Ben_1> oh that's why, the length is 0
[10:34:27] <Cork> so the element wasn't found
[10:35:17] <Ben_1> mh this is strange, but I can find it via firefox inspektor.
[10:35:26] <Ben_1> maybe I used the wrong path, let me check that
[10:35:35] <Cork> try with $('#element_id') instead of .find()
[10:35:44] <Cork> might not be a child of the element you search from
[10:36:14] <Cork> or it might not be in the dom when you search for it
[10:52:08] <Ben_1> it was the problem that the path to the element was wrong. Thx :)
[10:55:00] <samsamek> When the JS script changes the value of a field, does that field’s “onchange” eventhandler get triggered?
[10:55:38] <Cork> no
[10:55:47] <Cork> you can trigger it manually though
[10:55:57] <Cork> $('input').val('new value').trigger('change')
[10:56:21] <samsamek> Excellent thank you
[10:56:29] <Cork> note that that is only guaranteed to work if the event handler is bound with jquery though
[10:56:48] <samsamek> got it
[10:57:15] <samsamek> I’m actually trying to avoid it getting it triggered when the event was initiated by code. I want it to only respond to human input
[10:57:38] <Cork> ya, that is why they made it that way back in the 90's :)
[11:52:03] <jq> So any idea why firefox is blocking repeat network calls for some reason? https://arxius.io/i/89016a0d
[11:52:32] <jq> The first one works then it gives some non secure message on any after and it doesn't actually make the call
[11:59:04] <taplar> what response code is it getting?
[12:13:42] <grapheti> apparently no response #lamejoke
[12:14:49] <dimi1947> I have created a fiddle and on clicking an icon I get an error..the console says index:52...I suppose 52 refers to the JS line...nonetheless the JS pane does not have 52 lines...what is going on here?
[12:16:27] <grapheti> where's the fiddle?
[12:18:55] <dimi1947> grapheti: https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/xqmaa6tj/ if you want to see the output of the console and the error to which I am referring to...click the black diagonal line below "Services"
[12:19:47] <grapheti> I just see image 404s
[12:20:51] <grapheti> not sure what black diagonal you're referring to
[12:21:07] <dimi1947> give me a second...
[12:22:04] <dimi1947> https://1drv.ms/i/s!AjCBrCpLQye-g22vqXptuBBdlWmq
[12:22:34] <grapheti> ah, that doesn't show up in chrome
[12:23:10] <dimi1947> I use chrome..too...in me it's shown perfectly fine
[12:23:14] <grapheti> you need to put data types on services and prices
[12:23:15] <prillian5> Is there a pointer to initial value of an textfield (even if I currently still changed it) ?
[12:23:49] <grapheti> https://jsfiddle.net/xqmaa6tj/8/
[12:24:56] <dimi1947> the link you gave me does show the black line and it works without ptoblem,,,what did you do?
[12:25:12] <grapheti> dimi1947, look at your last fiddle
[12:25:23] <grapheti> dimi1947, do you see services and prices variable
[12:25:34] <grapheti> dimi1947, I put var in front of them
[12:25:39] <grapheti> so the parser knows it's a variable
[12:26:16] <dimi1947> weird...I thought they were declared as I copied paste the code
[12:26:20] <grapheti> common programming error :P I do it all the time
[12:26:38] <grapheti> it happens, no worries
[12:27:00] <dimi1947> thx
[12:27:25] <grapheti> prillian5, not sure what you mean by initial value? (x,y coordinates, initial state of the textfield...)?
[12:28:12] <prillian5> ah, sorry. I mean the value of an Textfield
[12:28:24] <prillian5> obj.value are only the current one
[12:28:29] <grapheti> ahhh
[12:28:59] <grapheti> so you're asking if you can keep a previous value even though it changed?
[12:33:11] <grapheti> Not sure if this will help - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29118178/input-jquery-get-old-value-before-onchange-and-get-value-after-on-change
[12:35:07] <prillian5> grapheti: thanx, found an easy solution
[12:35:15] <grapheti> sweet
[12:35:19] <prillian5> obj.defaultValue
[12:35:28] <grapheti> oh, nice
[12:35:43] <grapheti> ahhh, I see - totally read that the wrong way
[12:36:01] <prillian5> It's realy handy, if you wan't to check, if something in the input-field really differ from initial value
[12:36:30] <grapheti> yeah, I can see. You can compare, etc.
[12:36:53] <grapheti> glad you found a solution :D
[12:37:19] <prillian5> thanx for helping hands
[12:55:51] <jq> taplar: It's not getting any response coce
[12:56:32] <jq> It's like blocking it completely
[12:57:01] <taplar> and you're running it through the same exact logic?
[13:02:07] <jq> taplar: Yep
[13:02:31] <taplar> can you show us the logic?
[13:02:58] <jq> Just $.post( "etc/call", { id: id, phone: phone } );
[13:03:27] <jq> With $("html").on("click", ".track", function(){ triggering it
[13:03:55] <taplar> i don't see a jquery issue with that then.  have you tried to do the calls in a rest client?
[13:04:03] <jq> ?
[13:04:10] <jq> It works in everything but firefocx
[13:04:11] <taplar> what browser do you use?
[13:04:40] <jq> The script is part of my companies internal CRM to track the calls that salesmen make
[13:04:47] <jq> But this one guy insists on using firefox lol
[13:04:54] <jq> But it won't track his calls -__
[13:05:25] <taplar> https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/rested/?src=search  i would suggest trying to do the multiple calls from the rest client and see if they are blocked there
[13:07:31] <jq> Hrmmm
[13:07:31] <jq> Ok
[13:07:31] <jq> I hate mozilla
[13:07:31] <jq> They need to die already
[13:07:38] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:08:30] <jq> Like seriously
[13:08:40] <robertmaxrees> I use FF and never have issues with it.
[13:08:42] <jq> Everything about firefox gives web devs a hard time
[13:08:49] <robertmaxrees> latest release of dev edition is pretty good, too.
[13:08:56] <taplar> i prefer ff actually
[13:09:01] <jq> robertmaxrees: I bet you have an android too :P
[13:09:07] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:09:12] <jq> Woot I knew it
[13:09:24] <robertmaxrees> safari gives us more issues than any other browser/engine, too.
[13:09:31] <robertmaxrees> ios chrome is pretty lol.
[13:10:06] <jq> What safari is awesome
[13:10:17] <jq> No issues with anything on safari ever
[13:10:28] <jq> Webkit <3
[13:10:35] <taplar> i'm sure not all applications are built the same
[13:10:46] <robertmaxrees> taplar chrome on iOS uses webkit.
[13:10:54] <jq> I like mobile safari
[13:10:56] <jq> But desktop chrome
[13:11:03] <taplar> i'm just saying, in regards to differences in opinions between you two
[13:11:09] <robertmaxrees> oh, sure.
[13:11:22] <robertmaxrees> just sayin'.  we have far more issues here with safari than with any other browser.
[13:16:59] <jq> taplar: K so in that rest client thing it works 200 response every time
[13:17:53] <jq> Headers, in case that matters? https://pastebin.com/n9QYCPLC
[13:19:28] <taplar> in you actual code, what response code does the first request get?
[13:22:32] <jq> taplar: nothing
[13:22:35] <jq> There's no response codes
[13:22:50] <taplar> if a request finishes there should always be a response code
[13:23:10] <taplar> so i'd question if your request ever works
[13:24:22] <taplar> the rest client returned a 200.  your ajax should also be getting a 200
[13:25:24] <taplar> also from this pic ( https://arxius.io/i/89016a0d ) all your bubbles are gray
[13:25:31] <taplar> that usually means the request hasn't finished, iirc
[13:26:10] <taplar> or they may also be gray if it gets a 304, i forget
[13:26:25] <taplar> or 204, whatever cached is
[13:26:36] <taplar> unmodified
[13:27:09] <taplar> no, 304 is a yellow triange
[13:28:16] <jq> Yeah it's just showing gray like that
[13:28:27] <jq> It's like it's not even trying
[13:28:30] <jq> Cause it's showing as insecure too
[13:28:39] <jq> Which it
[13:28:43] <jq> it'll redirect to https
[13:28:45] <robertmaxrees> is the page you're on https and the endpoint is http?
[13:29:18] <jq> Nope
[13:29:21] <jq> Https and https
[13:29:26] <jq> If you look at the pic
[13:29:29] <jq> The first call shows https
[13:29:36] <jq> But after that first one it doesn't work after that
[13:29:36] <taplar> the icons have a slash in them
[13:29:44] <jq> Look at the first one
[13:29:45] <taplar> that means unsecure
[13:29:53] <jq> I know
[13:29:57] <jq> But look at the first
[13:30:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:30:11] <jq> The url doesn't change lol
[13:30:19] <jq> It's hardcoded as https://
[13:30:51] <jq> It's something with firefox blocking the subsequent requests
[13:31:00] * jq is going to kill the fox
[13:31:03] <robertmaxrees> you try setting cache: false on the ajax call?
[13:31:13] <jq> I suppose I could
[13:35:34] <jq> Same issue
[13:36:26] <taplar> i'm confused why it's trying to make http requests, if you say it's hardcoded to be https
[13:37:22] <jq> This is exactly what I have now
[13:37:22] <jq> https://pastebin.com/DmGy3WZ5
[13:39:40] <taplar> for shiggles, try doing:  "https://example.com/crm/etc/call?_="+ Date.now()
[13:43:55] <jq> taplar: That's like what the cache !1 does
[13:44:07] <taplar> right
[13:45:08] <jq> K trying it anyway
[13:45:51] <jq> Same thing :P
[13:46:10] <taplar> heh, well that's it for my ideas currently, ^_^
[13:46:30] <jq> And this is why I hate firefox
[13:46:46] <taplar> side question, why do you do !1?
[13:47:21] <jq> Same thing as false
[13:47:28] <taplar> so why not use false?
[13:47:33] <jq> Shorthand
[13:47:34] <jq> :P
[13:47:37] <taplar> k
[13:47:47] <jq> I'll try false
[13:47:49] <jq> Shouldn't make a diff though
[13:47:56] <taplar> no, i was just asking out of curiosity
[13:48:29] <jq> Yeah still errors :P
[13:48:30] <robertmaxrees> so the issue is what?  that the call never runs?
[13:48:51] <jq> I think it's that the first one never finishes?
[13:49:17] <prillian5> I append some input-fields all name="textbox[]" to an form. But I "....on("blur"...) is not firecd for new added elements.
[13:49:20] <prillian5> https://jsbin.com/hunegisoza/edit?js,output
[13:49:21] <jq> Cause it's got 673b for transfered
[13:49:23] <jq> But 0 for size
[13:49:23] <prillian5> Any Idea why?
[13:49:36] <robertmaxrees> jq` have you tried tossing a .catch() onto the call and looking at what gets passed there?
[13:50:14] <jq> prillian5: You have to do the on for the parent element, like $("theparent").on("blur", "actualelement", function() {...
[13:50:22] <robertmaxrees> prillian5 you can't bind to elements that don't yet exist.
[13:50:40] <robertmaxrees> ^ use a delegated handler insteand and you'll be g2g
[13:51:16] <prillian5> ok, thanks, I'll give it a try
[13:57:04] <taplar> mmm, after lunch cesta would be awesome today
[13:57:15] <prillian5> jq, robertmaxrees: but how makes blur on the parent-element sense?
[13:57:36] <prillian5> blur should only be fired If I leave the textfield
[13:58:03] <taplar> delegates listen for events originating from an elements children
[13:58:37] <taplar> the blur happens on "actualelement", which is a child of "theparent"
[13:59:19] <prillian5> so in this case, actualelement == my $("input[name^=textbox]) ?
[13:59:35] <taplar> yep
[13:59:44] <prillian5> ah, I see. Thank you
[14:01:44] <jq> Mhmm
[14:03:09] <prillian5> robertmaxrees: ok, seems  not to work
[14:03:11] <prillian5> have this:
[14:03:14] <prillian5> $(".output,#textBox_li").on('blur',$("input[name^=textbox]"),function(){...
[14:03:21] <taplar> no, just the text
[14:03:35] <taplar> heh, i was worried you read that wrong
[14:03:50] <taplar> .on('blur',"input[name^=textbox]",function(){...
[14:04:01] <prillian5> ah, ok.
[14:04:08] <jq> lol it’s a confusing syntax
[14:04:21] <jq> Simple once you do it once though
[14:07:59] <MikeD_> attribute name begins with textbox?  ew
[14:08:05] <prillian5> ^^ works now.
[14:13:13] <jq> prillian5: woot
[14:25:03] <Ziberius> hello
[14:25:17] <taplar> aloha
[14:26:32] <Ziberius> I'm having some problems with the jquery validator, I'm adding content dynamically and I think that's the problem, the validator doesn't seem to detect this dynamically added content
[14:26:38] <Ziberius> Any ideas how to handle this?
[14:27:15] <robertmaxrees> init after you've added the dynamically added content?
[14:31:36] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: yes that could work, of course I do this multiple times, it's not a problem to init the validator each time?
[14:32:08] <robertmaxrees> "i do this multiple times" as in you dynamically add things as the user goes?
[14:33:37] <Ziberius> robertmaxrees: yes exactly
[14:34:50] <robertmaxrees> you can also use https://jqueryvalidation.org/rules/
[14:37:17] <Ziberius> thanx i'll check it out
[14:51:20] <pippuccio76> Hi at all , hi have this error : Uncaught TypeError: $(...).dataTable is not a function this is my pastebin : https://pastebin.com/YWkyPtgB
[14:52:06] <taplar> where do you include data tables?
[14:52:14] <robertmaxrees> and where do you use it?
[14:52:43] <robertmaxrees> in custom.js ?
[15:02:06] <pippuccio76> i dont include datatable ....
[15:02:25] <pippuccio76> the paste is the source
[15:02:56] <taplar> soo......
[15:03:50] <taplar> can't use a plugin if you don't include it, no?
[15:04:00] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:04:11] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 that's why you're getting that error heh
[15:04:30] <taplar> it's a "plugin".  plug it in!
[15:05:55] <pippuccio76> its in custom js ,sorry
[15:06:10] <robertmaxrees> pippuccio76 show us the contents of custom.js
[15:06:58] <pippuccio76> https://pastebin.com/6YjWMzsJ
[15:07:15] <taplar> no dude
[15:07:17] <taplar> lol
[15:07:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you never include the plugin.
[15:07:33] <taplar> look back on your other page
[15:07:40] <taplar> see where you include the data tables css?
[15:07:57] <taplar> similarly, you have to include the data tables logic
[15:08:12] <taplar> data tables is not core jquery
[15:08:18] <robertmaxrees> ^^
[15:08:52] <pippuccio76> ok tanks
[15:09:51] <pippuccio76> another answer , ther's a way to select a value of an input select automatically by selecting another select option ?
[15:11:19] <taplar> two <select> 's?
[15:12:23] <pippuccio76> yes , in this page if you see there are 2 select , i want select automativcally a value of second select when i select a value on first
[15:14:44] <taplar> sure.  you'd just attach a change event to one of the selects, and then set the value of the other
[15:22:00] <pippuccio76> this is an esample , can u help me ?
[15:22:01] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/r27sf3fb/
[15:22:34] <taplar> so, are you familiar with event bindings?
[15:23:07] <pippuccio76> yes onchange
[15:23:22] <taplar> that's a dom event binding property
[15:23:34] <taplar> i'm talking about how to use jquery to create bindings
[15:24:16] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/r27sf3fb/3/
[15:24:36] <taplar> onchange isn't a jquery method
[15:24:41] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/
[15:24:52] <taplar> give this page, and possibly subsequent pages, a read
[15:28:30] <pippuccio76> it's ok now https://jsfiddle.net/r27sf3fb/8/?
[15:28:48] <taplar> read that page dude
[15:29:02] <taplar> look at the syntax they use
[15:33:30] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/r27sf3fb/9/
[15:36:02] <taplar> boom
[15:36:31] <maslo> anyone used select2 in the past ? https://select2.org/
[15:37:04] <grapheti> Everyone uses selectize now - https://selectize.github.io/selectize.js/
[15:37:13] <pippuccio76> taplar : how now select the second automatically ?
[15:37:39] <taplar> you have to write that logic pippuccio76.  it's not going to do it automatically
[15:38:54] <pippuccio76> whic is the comand to select a value of slect ?
[15:39:00] <maslo> I will look into it grapheti, the reason why I'm asking is because my boss wants me to modify the plugin itself to display results 1 per line
[15:39:08] <maslo> rather than inline, doesnt seem to be an option so I was looking for alternative
[15:39:12] <maslo> hopefully the one you mention has that option
[15:40:10] <grapheti> results 1 per line?
[15:40:23] <maslo> the boxes (the selection i guess)
[15:41:14] <pippuccio76> teplar :https://jsfiddle.net/r27sf3fb/10/ now its ok :) ?
[15:42:23] <maslo> you know how it goes to a new line when the max width is reached
[15:42:36] <maslo> boss wants it to instantly add a new line and the result
[15:45:17] <grapheti> https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e3/d8/8c/e3d88c895bd8707443c2fbf725b90175.png
[15:45:34] <maslo> loll
[15:48:25] <pippuccio76> https://jsfiddle.net/r27sf3fb/11/
[15:54:56] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/r27sf3fb/12/  works fine
[16:24:27] <stan_man_can> Anyone have a recommendation for a good datetime picker ?
[16:25:41] <robertmaxrees> datetime or just date?
[16:25:56] <stan_man_can> datetime :(
[16:27:41] <stan_man_can> i mean i guess i could separate them but
[16:35:40] <grapheti> http://t1m0n.name/air-datepicker/docs/ ?
[16:39:49] <robertmaxrees> he also wants a timepicker included tho heh
[16:40:35] <grapheti> like this? - http://t1m0n.name/air-datepicker/docs/#timepicker
[17:01:37] <hellyeah> is there any framework for webgl written with jquery?
[17:18:05] <cannap> lol
[17:18:44] <cannap> you can make this
[17:18:57] <cannap> var $ = someWebGlFramework
[17:19:04] <cannap> and use $
[17:19:09] <cannap> xD
[17:20:22] <hellyeah> cannap:  :D
[17:27:32] <grapheti> var 💩 = someWebGlFramework
[17:27:36] <grapheti> always use the poo
[17:27:49] <taplar> woah
[17:28:20] <taplar> poo webgl : "It's the shit"
[17:28:28] <grapheti> :D
[17:28:56] <taplar> though you can never trust poo developers, ya know?
[17:29:06] <taplar> they're too fecel
[17:29:10] <grapheti> lmao
[17:29:52] <grapheti> and anal about everything
[17:34:42] <taplar> we play off of each other well
[17:34:45] <taplar> that was a good scat
[17:35:13] <grapheti> haha
[17:48:39] <hellyeah> hat does facel mean?_
[17:49:10] <taplar> http://www.dictionary.com/browse/fecal
[17:50:02] <taplar> which was intended to be a pun on fickel
[17:50:11] <taplar> *fickle
[17:53:13] <hellyeah> i see
[18:24:08] <Al_nz1> can you make fiddles private?
[18:25:47] <hellyeah> what do you mean?
[18:26:02] <hellyeah> why will you do private fiddle?
[18:28:37] <Al_nz1> so not everyone can see it
[18:28:41] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[18:29:09] <robertmaxrees> why would you want them to be private?
[18:31:32] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: sometimes sensative stuff, even though obfusicated
[18:31:44] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[18:31:49] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle isn't intended for that kind of work.
[18:31:59] <robertmaxrees> it's just for proof of concepts and small snippets.
[18:32:02] <robertmaxrees> not for sensitive data.
[18:32:59] <hellyeah> Al_nz1:  use bitbucket
[18:33:17] <hellyeah> and your local
[18:33:31] <hellyeah> you can construct private repo in bitbucket
[18:33:52] <hellyeah> jsfiddle is just sahring the code and helping the others, fixing problems etc.
[18:40:05] <Al_nz1> I think this is obfusciated enough anyway. https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/w4avu3er/10/ - its a marking matrix - but I was wondering if there is a better way that using arrays to work out which groups need to be marked?
[18:54:21] <robertmaxrees> wat
[18:54:47] <robertmaxrees> what are you asking?
[18:55:07] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any jquery/js in that fiddle heh
[18:56:00] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: is there a better way to approach that than creating an array of questions, then depending on whihc groups need to be marked you loop over the respective arrays. I have a function for each combination of arrays - make any sense?
[18:56:22] <robertmaxrees> i'm still way lost.
[18:57:05] <robertmaxrees> you keep referencing code that isn't there.
[19:01:45] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 i'm gathering that you're not sharing these arrays becuase they contain sensitive data, right?
[19:31:10] <carpii> i have a rich single page app, where ive now ended up with a huge list of .on event handler declarations. Its getting messy, and wonder if theres any design pattern or techniques to help make it more manageable ?
[19:33:51] <robertmaxrees> what are those handlers doing
[19:34:36] <carpii> all sorts, responding to button clicks, draggable divs, popups etc
[19:34:40] <carpii> its a html5 chat application
[19:36:15] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you shoulda used a framework instead.
[19:36:22] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see what the code looks like tbh.
[19:36:39] <carpii> yeah maybe, what framework would have helped?
[19:36:48] <robertmaxrees> entirely depends on what you're looking for.
[19:36:55] <robertmaxrees> riot, react, angular, backbone.,..
[19:37:16] <carpii> http://carpii.homeip.net/skitch/jcode-20170926-003714.png
[19:37:33] <carpii> i knew react would have helped, but i had a very limited timespan to get this live
[19:37:41] <carpii> not heard of riot, ill look into it thanks
[19:37:52] <carpii> bit too far down the line to convert it all to react tbf
[19:43:18] <robertmaxrees> well.
[19:43:19] <robertmaxrees> so.
[19:43:25] <robertmaxrees> some of these are doing the same right, yeah?
[19:43:38] <carpii> shouldn't be, no
[19:43:54] <carpii> unless you mean responding to the same event type such as click
[19:44:00] <robertmaxrees> i mean the same callback.
[19:44:06] <robertmaxrees> and there are a few things I would change here.
[19:45:14] <robertmaxrees> for that .chatinput, you have two separate handlers calling the same function - you can to .on('click blur' for those
[19:45:16] <robertmaxrees> and have one.
[19:45:25] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you calling an anonymous function for each of these?
[19:45:39] <robertmaxrees> why not just .on('click', 'someSelector', theFunction) ?
[19:46:35] <carpii> you im not sure tbh :) I think its because they had the function bodies in there, and then it was refactored
[19:46:38] <carpii> good point though, cheers
[19:46:42] <robertmaxrees> heh
[19:47:37] <carpii> if my event handler was to have 'click blur'
[19:47:46] <carpii> does jQuery guarantee they would be triggered in this order?
[19:48:39] <carpii> nm, would be triggered in the order the events came through
[19:55:30] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: sorry - kids this end
[19:55:38] <Al_nz1> will try again later
[19:55:49] <robertmaxrees> uh
[19:55:50] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[20:11:14] <SideFX> What is a good way to move the page up automatically so if I div that is shown on the fly displays below the browser window?
[20:11:47] <cannap> fixed
