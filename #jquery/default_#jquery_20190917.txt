[01:09:29] <joonghunpark0718> Hi, I have a question about my Chromium Blink patch's impact on jQuery.
[01:09:51] <joonghunpark0718> I wrote it in https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/4484, so could you please reply on this?
[01:10:42] <joonghunpark0718> I implemented html table spec's behavior, so now with the patch Blink will works the same as Firefox
[01:11:52] <joonghunpark0718> But it could effect jQuery's behavior, so I wonder if it is ok with jQuery.

[11:40:11] <Es0teric> i am having an issue where the $('#message') keeps getting appended... but i only want it appended once on click
[11:40:52] <robertmaxrees> well yeah.  you aren't checking if it exists before appending it.
[11:41:39] <Es0teric> ah
[11:41:51] <robertmaxrees> prepend does just that :)
[11:47:42] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://kopy.io/BV9jc
[11:47:46] <Es0teric> would that be how I check for it?
[11:48:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably move that check into the function itself.
[11:48:33] <robertmaxrees> but basically.
[11:48:48] <robertmaxrees> though you can just do if ($('#foo').length) {
[11:48:59] <robertmaxrees> no need for the > 0
[11:49:06] <Es0teric> ah
[11:59:01] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://kopy.io/pJA0n
[11:59:11] <Es0teric> that doesnt display
[12:00:50] <robertmaxrees> sorry - you want to negate that check.
[12:01:01] <robertmaxrees> if (!$('#foo').length) {
[12:01:02] <robertmaxrees> my bad.
[12:17:28] <Es0teric> ah
[13:49:58] <Flyste> Does anyone know of any trick to get a browser to play a sound on document ready?
[13:50:16] <robertmaxrees> no way to guarantee it.
[13:54:00] <robertmaxrees> same with video, in fact.
[13:55:03] <Flyste> Unless you are youtube
[13:55:10] <robertmaxrees> well, sort of.
[13:55:13] <robertmaxrees> there are rules.
[13:55:39] <robertmaxrees> at the browser level.  if the user visits the site often and initiates play frequently, then autoplay can be turned on.
[13:55:42] <robertmaxrees> but it's not guaratneed.
[13:55:44] <robertmaxrees> *guaranteed
[13:55:51] <Flyste> Really?
[13:56:02] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/09/autoplay-policy-changes
[13:56:35] <robertmaxrees> it's because autoplaying sounds are annoying
[13:57:04] <Flyste> Thanks
[13:57:12] <Flyste> That is a good link to know
[13:57:41] <robertmaxrees> FireFox is much more strict about it.
[16:00:28] <sydbarret> anybody awake?
[16:00:40] <robertmaxrees> don't ask to ask ;)
[16:01:52] <sydbarret> robert
[16:02:01] <robertmaxrees> that's my name
[16:02:05] <sydbarret> https://pasteboard.co/Ixtv2B7.png
[16:02:16] <sydbarret> i have that datatable with that search filter
[16:02:31] <sydbarret> after I search and check some rows I do POST
[16:02:43] <sydbarret> is there a  way to retain the search when reloading?
[16:02:50] <robertmaxrees> when reloading the page?
[16:02:57] <sydbarret> yes
[16:03:03] <robertmaxrees> have your server render back out.
[16:03:07] <robertmaxrees> *render it back out.
[16:03:22] <sydbarret> you mean to send the text in the search box to the method?
[16:03:43] <sydbarret> im using flask
[16:03:57] <robertmaxrees> i mean, server-side, you want to render that search box with the value set to the term.
[16:05:12] <sydbarret> yes but how do i do that
[16:05:18] <robertmaxrees> i don't know flask :)
[16:05:18] <sydbarret> say i have this in my template
[16:05:20] <sydbarret> <form id="remove" action="{{url_for('remove_neg',id=cust_id)}}" method="POST">
[16:05:37] <sydbarret> where remove_neg is a function in flask
[16:05:38] <robertmaxrees> generally, you would store that term somewhere.
[16:05:52] <robertmaxrees> and then value="thevariablewiththeterm"
[16:06:42] <sydbarret> i could probably send the term to the server. But how do I reference that value?
[16:06:53] <robertmaxrees> you already are sending the term to the server :)
[16:07:04] <robertmaxrees> that's how it gets it and does stuff with it.
[16:07:15] <sydbarret> no, what I post is not the term is just the customer ID
[16:07:31] <robertmaxrees> then you need to send the term to the server somehow as well.
[16:07:38] <robertmaxrees> how that works with flask, I do not know.
[16:08:03] <sydbarret> im reading something to save that in cookies
[16:08:36] <sydbarret> see this  "when you add a neg keyword or remove it and there's a search active on the table, the page should come back with the same search.one way to do this is to send the search to the server, have it put it into flash, and have the subsequent render load the table w/ that search otherwise, you can put it into a cookie every time they change it and if a cookie exists on page load, you can just load the table w/ that phrase"
[16:10:10] <sydbarret> is it clearer for you?
[16:10:20] <robertmaxrees> sorry dude, i have a dayjob as well ;)
[16:10:31] <robertmaxrees> and go with the first suggestion.
[16:10:34] <robertmaxrees> don't store it in a cookie.
[16:18:05] <robertmaxrees> if you're still confused, it's very possible i don't have enough information to help you, since screenshots are rarely helpful when talking about code.
[16:20:41] <sydbarret> robertmaxree I think i have to do something like this https://datatables.net/examples/server_side/custom_vars.html
[16:21:02] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, i don't have enough information.  make a fiddle :)
[16:22:36] <nick1> Hi all, I have a question on the addToCourseCart() function on this page: http://new.coursepickle.com/?q=BIT-2405 In particular, this line $('.dropdown-toggle').dropdown('toggle'); does not appear to be working. If I run that line outside the function in the console it does work. Does anyone know what I'm missing
[16:23:25] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:23:33] <robertmaxrees> nick1 where is it getitng called from?
[16:23:42] <robertmaxrees> nick1 have you confirmed that code branch is getting hit?
[16:24:27] <nick1> yes I set a debugger in there
[16:24:37] <nick1> It's being called by
[16:24:57] <primitivMedia> \b#\w+\b does this not target all words begining with a hashtag and followed by letters?
[16:25:07] <robertmaxrees> primitivMedia ask in ##javascript :)
[16:25:14] <primitivMedia> oops sorry
[16:26:57] <robertmaxrees> nick1 probably an issue with event bubbling.
[16:27:30] <nick1> event bubbling, hmm.. I'll look into that. Thanks for the pointer
[16:27:40] <robertmaxrees> pass the event object to addToCourseCart and then do event.stopPropagation()
[16:33:32] <nick1> robertmaxrees if it's not too involved, can you share an example of how I would pass an event object to a function
[16:33:53] <robertmaxrees> in your case - function addToCourseCart(event) {
[16:34:16] <robertmaxrees> or just e - whichever makes more sense to you.
[16:34:17] <nick1> but what would event be?
[16:34:38] <robertmaxrees> jquery passes the event object for you.
[16:34:50] <nick1> ahh okay, thanks
[16:35:04] <robertmaxrees> so your $('.foo').on('event', functionName); - internally, on then does callback(event) basically.
[16:35:12] <robertmaxrees> so you just gotta give it a name so you can refer back to it.
[16:37:10] <nick1> Something like this? http://dpaste.com/21VWQCM#line-7
[16:37:25] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:37:37] <robertmaxrees> leave the binding alone: $(document).on('click', '.add_to_course_cart', addToCourseCart);
[16:37:50] <robertmaxrees> but keep the other changes.
[16:39:13] <nick1> No error, but still doesn't seem to toggle correctly.
[16:39:30] <robertmaxrees> link to the page again?
[16:39:39] <nick1> http://new.coursepickle.com/?q=BIT-2405
[16:39:58] <nick1> I didn't push the changes there though
[16:40:01] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:40:09] <robertmaxrees> can you make a fiddle or something then?
[16:40:27] <nick1> Yes I'll work on that. thanks for the help
[16:41:56] <robertmaxrees> wait
[16:42:25] <robertmaxrees> which dropdown widget are you using?
[16:45:36] <nick1> bootstrap
[16:46:23] <nick1> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/dropdowns/#via-javascript
[16:46:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah already there.
[16:47:02] <robertmaxrees> makes me wonder if there's an issue with the init not happening until you manually call that method.
[16:47:04] <robertmaxrees> not sure though.
[16:56:21] <nick1> Not sure I even made this fiddle correctly, but maybe it has the gist? https://jsfiddle.net/e14hustx/3/
[16:56:37] <robertmaxrees> woah
[16:57:00] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/v5q3za9L/
[16:57:19] <robertmaxrees> needed to swap jkquery to come before bootstrap, and needed to remove it from the frameworks and extensions dropdown.
[16:59:10] <nick1> thanks!
[17:01:33] <nick1> robertmaxrees do you know why in this case the stoppropogation is required?
[17:01:51] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what it does? :)
[17:02:27] <nick1> definitely not clearly haha. It seems like the purpose is to stop the event from going to other elements in the DOM
[17:02:32] <nick1> or am I way off?
[17:02:38] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[17:03:02] <robertmaxrees> most events "bubble" from an element all the way to the root node.
[17:03:48] <robertmaxrees> in this case, the dropdown likely has a listener bound on the document or window to capture clicks outside of it, which in turn closes it.
[17:04:14] <robertmaxrees> if you set a breakpoint on that call to .dropdown() and then step through, you'll see it open and then eventually close.
[17:07:41] <sbs> hi
[17:08:09] <sbs> can anyone help with jquery-ui draggable class not working properly with BS4 & MDBoostrap ?
[17:08:42] <nick1> Hmm okay I think that's making sense. Thanks for your help with this! Now to see why it's not working for me
[17:09:16] <sbs> code used to work with BS3. Changing to BS4&MDBootstrap (free), the draggable effect is gone
[17:13:12] <robertmaxrees> sbs your first problem is trying to use jqueryui and bootstrap together.
[17:14:05] <sbs> you mean with BS4 ?
[17:14:15] <robertmaxrees> BS4 is bootstrap 4, right?
[17:14:29] <sbs> yes BS4 is Boostrap4
[17:14:39] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you don't want to mix jquery ui and bootstrap.
[17:14:43] <robertmaxrees> any version of bootstrap.
[17:14:48] <robertmaxrees> surprising you didn't run into issues sooner.
[17:14:58] <sbs> ok it did run before :(
[17:15:05] <robertmaxrees> see my last sentence :)
[17:15:11] <sbs> how do I get draggeble in BS4?
[17:15:12] <robertmaxrees> just move over to bootstrap.
[17:15:37] <robertmaxrees> https://mdbootstrap.com/plugins/jquery/draggable/ this seems to do what you want
[17:15:55] <sbs> this comes for 9$
[17:16:03] <sbs> (I had found it)
[17:16:14] <robertmaxrees> dunno then - try searching goole :)
[17:16:17] <robertmaxrees> *google
[17:16:23] <robertmaxrees> that's what i'd have to do.
[17:16:23] <sbs> afterrmoving jqueryUI and trying mdboostrap
[17:17:54] <sbs> s/after removing
[17:19:01] <nick1> I guess I just didn't use stopPropogation close enough to calling the dropdown it seems. Thanks again for the help
[20:43:54] <sydbarret> anybody awake?
[23:17:03] <sydbarret> anybody has used datatables to send the filter to the server in flask?
