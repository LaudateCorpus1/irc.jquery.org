[14:59:57] <cloud69> Waiyoooooo!!! Anyone eager to earn a quick buck translating a small script from vanila JS to jquery for me?
[15:00:07] <robertmaxrees> wrong place to ask for that cloud69 :)
[15:00:33] <cloud69> robertmaxrees: lol why's that
[15:00:48] <robertmaxrees> this is a support channel.  not a place to hire contractors.
[15:01:05] <cloud69> ah i see
[15:57:13] <Turmfalke> Which method is the equivalent to .appendTo() but replacing the whole element contents?
[15:57:54] <robertmaxrees> just the element contents or the element entirely?
[15:59:12] <Turmfalke> The contents only
[15:59:14] <robertmaxrees> Turmfalke you'll want to do an .empty() on the target element and then just .append() the new contents.
[15:59:39] <Turmfalke> Ah, okay
[19:40:06] <errorous> Hello. I'm working on a wordpress website for a client, and they have this idiotic plugin that creates whole page's content in javascript. This being said, I need to select some of the nodes in jquey so that I can append some of my content
[19:40:40] <robertmaxrees> ok
[19:40:50] <errorous> is there literraly any way of selecting dynamically added element without access to the code that adds is actually creating that element
[19:41:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?  dynamically added content can be selected just fine.
[19:41:45] <robertmaxrees> is the issue that you don't have an event or something to key off of?
[19:42:06] <errorous> robertmaxrees can be
[19:42:15] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[19:42:59] <errorous> so, I make sure my jquery is loaded last, literally last, and I can't select that dynamically created element
[19:43:14] <errorous> if I try my selector in chrome's js console, it works
[19:43:27] <robertmaxrees> i think you're conflating issues.  can you share the page or give some more context?
[19:43:48] <errorous> can't share the page. what kind of info do you need more?
[19:44:41] <robertmaxrees> you keep saying you "can't" select dynamically created elements.  but you can.  saying that you load jquery last doesn't really make much of a difference depending on, for instance, what the plugin is doing, what it's waiting for, etc.
[19:45:00] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like maybe the plugin is waiting for page load or something similar.
[19:45:09] <robertmaxrees> which means you're dealing with a race condition.
[19:45:19] <errorous> that js that creates elements is actually ran on document ready
[19:45:25] <errorous> I do the same for my jquery
[19:45:52] <robertmaxrees> what plugin is it?
[19:46:07] <errorous> it's not a jquery plugni
[19:46:21] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: okay then.
[19:46:41] <robertmaxrees> dunno then :)
[19:46:53] <robertmaxrees> you might have to resort to recursive setTimeout calls and go from there?
[19:47:02] <errorous> damn :)
[19:47:14] <robertmaxrees> without more context i got nothin'.
[19:48:13] <robertmaxrees> are you sure your code is even running?  keep in mind invalid markup can cause doc ready to fire at strange time.  also: depending on a whole host of factors, something might be delaying that plugin to fire later than doc ready.
[19:48:45] <robertmaxrees> or the code's firing an ajax request, in which case the rendering isn't actually happening in doc ready.  etc.
[19:48:58] <errorous> robertmaxrees let me add my code back again and I'll share url privately with you, that ok?
[19:49:07] <robertmaxrees> eh, not comfortable with that.
[19:49:15] <errorous> ok, sorry.
[19:49:19] <robertmaxrees> if the channel can't see it, i don't wanna :)
[19:49:28] <errorous> ok, makes sense
