[00:44:23] <TeddyMurray> sup friends
[12:54:32] <hrobi> hi
[12:54:51] <hrobi> I'm trying to create some forms with jquery -- there seem to be quite a few extension to jquery that do this
[12:55:18] <hrobi> Im confused about how oftern these examples and extensions use jquery 1.x
[12:55:26] <hrobi> instead of simply the latest jquery 3.x
[12:55:50] <hrobi> is jquery 3.x not well adopted yet?
[12:56:26] <hrobi> any pointers to features in jquery 3 that I could just use for forms?
[13:00:27] <bestdesign> hrobi: with latest jquery some things is removed in forms
[13:00:48] <bestdesign> like now you can only use .done for complete
[13:00:51] <bestdesign> .fail for error
[13:01:18] <bestdesign> no more .error etc
[13:01:24] <hrobi> bestdesign, ok
[13:01:35] <hrobi> I think I should be striving to use jquery 3
[13:01:54] <hrobi> but this rules out all the extensions ive been looking at
[13:02:09] <hrobi> but I guess there is a jquery.forms batteries included right?
[13:02:56] <bestdesign> hrobi: is depends on the theme and how old is it
[13:03:32] <bestdesign> hrobi: btw i also hate use many plugins on a site because that case if something older not will work
[13:04:01] <hrobi> I can see there is a bootstrap forms option, maybe this is going to be more solid
[13:04:24] <bestdesign> that is a .js? never used
[13:05:40] <bestdesign> hrobi: https://coreui.io/docs/components/forms/
[13:06:02] <bestdesign> the ajax side can be jquery
[13:06:07] <bestdesign> not bootstrap
[14:00:32] <hrobi> bestdesign, thanks, this looks like what I need, yes I should stick with jquery for what it does best
[14:00:44] <hrobi> what is coreui?
[14:01:54] <hrobi> nm, just saw the coreui intro lol
[14:02:17] <bestdesign> hrobi: is just something framework or no idea just found on google :D
[14:02:58] <hrobi> bestdesign, nice to see they use jquery 3.x
[14:03:03] <bestdesign> hrobi: a trick if you not want such with backend like php and js you can use formspree.io
[14:03:05] <bestdesign> to submit form :D
[14:03:30] <robertmaxrees> or google forms.
[14:03:34] <hrobi> thanks, actually Im only looking for nice forms, no submission, no backend
[14:03:40] <hrobi> right ;)
[14:03:49] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees: google forms support that too?
[14:03:53] <bestdesign> nice :D
[14:04:01] <robertmaxrees> i missed the original question.
[14:04:29] <hrobi> robertmaxrees, thanks, my question was how to create nice forms with jquery basically
[14:04:40] <robertmaxrees> no need for jquery imho.
[14:04:43] <robertmaxrees> or any js, really.
[14:04:54] <hrobi> robertmaxrees, and I was perplexed by jquery extensions that still use jquery 1.x
[14:04:59] <bestdesign> hrobi: the robertmaxrees is a pro here so he know what said :D
[14:05:19] <robertmaxrees> hrobi yeah, sounds about right.  lots of discontinued projects out there.
[14:05:24] <hrobi> robertmaxrees, thanks robertmaxrees - maybe all I want is bootstrap or other things like that
[14:05:42] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: if you're literally just building a form, that's pretty overkill imho.
[14:05:44] <robertmaxrees> but whatevs.
[14:06:37] <hrobi> :D I'm dead lazy, and unskilled at css
[14:07:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:07:10] <hrobi> dont shoot me
[14:07:12] <bestdesign> hrobi: https://www.sanwebe.com/2016/07/ajax-form-submit-examples-using-jquery
[14:08:10] <hrobi> Im in a pickle as need to do both frontend and backend dev -- Im no ui dev at all, so just need something that works to begin with, then when I have money i will move out of they way
[14:08:32] <robertmaxrees> then just do a google form and be done with it :)
[14:09:20] <hrobi> yeah :) thanks this looks like a good start --- html comes with forms included, sometimes I get sidetracked looking for overkills as you said
[21:50:16] <snackoverflow> I have see two iframes on a web page that is not mine. To get the second iframe I have to do: $('iframe[title="Chapter 20: The Progressives"]').contents().find('iframe[title="Chapter 20: The Progressives"]')[1]. I can't add .contents() to the end of this for some reason, unless I take off the [1]. I want to do .contents() so I can access what's inside. Can anyone help?
