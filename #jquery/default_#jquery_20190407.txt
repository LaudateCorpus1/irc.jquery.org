[04:03:15] <al_nz1> How would I disable the button until one of the radio's is selected? https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/yzm04sgf/
[12:32:05] <ryan_ford> can anyone recommend a link for v1.12 docs?
[12:42:22] <shoky_> the current docs.. that's the latest 1.x version. or if you must see the docs as they were then... https://web.archive.org/web/20160501053952/https://api.jquery.com/
[12:49:15] <ryan_ford> the current docs on the website are the 1.x docs and not 3.x?
[12:50:52] <shoky_> they are for both. if something was added/changed in 2.x or 3.x the docs mention it
[12:51:11] <ryan_ford> ahh i see
[12:54:07] <ryan_ford> thanks
[12:54:21] <shoky_> and not that much has changed, except that 2.x/3.x removed a lot of old-IE stuff, and that 3.x promises are spec-compliant promises
[12:57:41] <ryan_ford> do you know of a browser support table for 3.x?
[12:57:51] <ryan_ford> website just mentions current - 1
[12:58:09] <ryan_ford> but i wonder what it actually is
[13:22:03] <shoky_> not IE, basically :\
[13:24:55] <thebigj> I am trying to identify the error message of failing ajax request. Here is my code
[13:24:58] <thebigj> https://dpaste.de/duks/raw
[13:25:09] <thebigj> Can anyone help me to identify what the error is?
[13:25:10] <thebigj> Thanks!
[13:27:36] <shoky_> thebigj: that's not a valid url probably.  add e.g. http://   or just //  to the beginnning
[13:28:07] <shoky_> or if it's the same origin as the webpage its running on,  just "/"
[13:29:53] <shoky_> and if it still doesn't work, probably a cross-origin issue - server needs to be configured to send proper CORS headers
[13:31:18] <shoky_> and btw the first argument to 'error' callback is not error_type, it's the XHR object. there are more arguments too, tho not helpful for your specific error
[13:37:58] <thebigj> shoky_: OKay. I tried observing the Jquery docs for $.ajax but I was unable to find appropriate values for "error"
[13:45:18] <azta> could anyone suggest a (hopefully small) jquery library for manipulating SVG's? Or would it be simpler just to use JS? I'm only drawing a few simple graphs so d3 is way over the top. Thanks
[13:45:18] <thebigj> shoky_: I changed the code to https://dpaste.de/QwXO/raw
[13:45:39] <thebigj> shoky_: It doesn't highlight what is the actual error
[13:49:16] <shoky_> thebigj: check for browser warnings in your js console (make sure they are turned on). CORS errors usually only appear there. and chrome is more friendly about it than firefox, sometimes
