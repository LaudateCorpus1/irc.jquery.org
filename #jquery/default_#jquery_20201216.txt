[03:19:04] <robertmaxrees> i like how i gave bboy the answer earlier and they completely ignored it.
[04:01:40] <jamesprada> hello friends - nice to meet you here
[04:01:54] <robertmaxrees> yo
[04:02:05] <jamesprada> once I did nice chat in jquery and now I want to create Like Button
[04:02:46] <robertmaxrees> ok
[04:08:03] <jamesprada> i have no idea... the subject is big. Can you give me some link to some working examples of LIKE button?
[04:09:24] <robertmaxrees> broad subject.  the basics are that you want to bind a click handler that sends an async request (probably via ajax if you're using jquery) to your server that saves that action.
[04:09:43] <robertmaxrees> and then you add a class to change the styling.
[04:09:54] <robertmaxrees> pretty basic overall when you break it down.
[04:10:03] <robertmaxrees> anyway, gotta get to bed finally.  happy hacking!
[04:13:20] <jamesprada> OK. i woke up... and I am in bed. You can take your lap into bed. But tomorrow. I think the best Idea for programmers is to stay in bed all day. LoL - I think I f kill myself because this like button. LOL
[04:13:24] <jamesprada> Just Kidding
[11:11:32] <engaged> I have a function like (“#zipCode”).keyup(function() { if($(this).length==5) { //get city and state from zip code from DB } }); the problem is its caling the function to get city and state twice if you enter the zip code really quickly… anyway to avoid this? I can’t just unbind the function because the zip code may change or they enter it wrong so I need it to always check but I’m wasting time calling this function twice sometimes i
[11:11:32] <engaged> zip is entered fast…
[11:15:55] <shoky> engaged: sounds like you want a "debounce" on the event handler. google it ;p
[11:43:36] <engaged> shoky: thanks - that worked
[12:55:36] <zacwalls> Hello, I am trying to build this scoring form and I am not having success summing each column in the table. The total section score works just fine. I think it has to do with the selector for the column. Is there a more optimal way I could be doing this that also works correctly? https://jsfiddle.net/ptn6vesz/14/
[13:40:16] <mulch2> if "var x = document.getElementsByTagName("iframe")[1].contentWindow" points me to a iframe i want, how can i then target all the td elements in that frame?
[13:40:21] <mulch2> or rather, how can i convert it to jquery, so that i can do it easily?
[13:41:40] <mulch2> every attempt to use jquery from this point throws an error -- is it because it's an htmlcollection?
[13:45:44] <mulch2> if i wanted to target a div with an id from this point, "var div = x.document.getElementById("id");" would work fine, but my challenge now is it isn't a specific elem, and none of them have IDs.
[13:58:59] <robertmaxrees> mulch2 that's a great question for ##javascript :)
[13:59:47] <mulch2> haha, sup, robert :)
[13:59:50] <robertmaxrees> mulch2 but also: you can use querySelectorAll() and use selectors like you're used to :)
[14:00:51] <robertmaxrees> also: $("#myiframe").contents() ;)
[14:09:35] <mulch2> are you saying i can use either of those to target all the iframe tags?
[14:10:18] <mulch2> and narrow it to the one i want? like the vanilla js line above?
[14:11:18] <robertmaxrees> $("#myiframe").contents() will get the contents of the iframe.
[14:11:22] <robertmaxrees> you can .find() off of that.
[14:18:52] <mulch2> whenever i try to target the iframe with jquery it gives me an undefined error, or just won't do anything. that vanilla js was the only thing i found that targeted it, but i just don't understand how i can convert it to something that allow me to use jquery.
[14:18:57] <mulch2> for instance, the iframe is #main, so i did:
[14:19:00] <mulch2> var y = $("#main").contents().filter("td");
[14:19:02] <mulch2> y.css({"color": "red", "border": "2px solid red"});
[14:19:08] <robertmaxrees> ??
[14:19:11] <robertmaxrees> why .filter()?
[14:19:15] <robertmaxrees> i said .find()
[14:19:27] <mulch2> oh, whoops, sec.
[14:20:19] <mulch2> damn, you're good.
[14:20:37] <robertmaxrees> fwiw that's a 2 second google search for "jquery select elements in iframe" :)
[14:20:40] <z1haze> how would you write this without querying for .add-to-cart-messages twice? https://bpa.st/RV2Q
[14:21:14] <mulch2> robert, if you knew how many tabs i had open and how long i've gone in circles with this stuff :/ lol
[14:21:30] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you can't.  $('.foo') can only select things that exist at the time you run it.
[14:21:35] <mulch2> i don't mean to bother you with things i can easily find -- i usually resort to this when i'm at my wits end.
[14:21:54] <robertmaxrees> :) mulch2 it's all good, just pointing out the easy self-service available.
[14:21:56] <mulch2> but thanks so much.
[14:22:02] <z1haze> alright, just was curious. my ide seems to think its possible by telling me i hve a duplicated selector
[14:22:21] <robertmaxrees> z1haze can always pull that string into a var :shrug:
[14:22:28] <z1haze> does append() return the appended jquery object? the docs say it returns jQuery but i dont know if that points to that new object or not
[14:22:38] <mulch2> haha, maybe it's easier to decipher all the help  when you already have a good foundation.
[14:22:47] <mulch2> i'm coming tho.
[14:23:30] <robertmaxrees> z1haze really easy way to find out.
[14:23:41] <z1haze> mm
[14:24:26] <robertmaxrees> z1haze https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vt4e2bha/
[14:24:59] <z1haze> well how about that
[14:25:06] <robertmaxrees> again, easy way to find out :)
[14:30:11] <robertmaxrees> tho z1haze i'd argue if you have code that checks to see if something exists before appending it, just add it to the base page to begin with and hide/show it instead.
[14:30:32] <z1haze> fair point
[14:45:31] <cancelthefuture_> Hey everyone, just wondering if code.jquery.com has had any dns change in the last 24 hours
[14:45:53] <robertmaxrees> cancelthefuture_ dunno - what's up?
[14:46:15] <cancelthefuture_> my team is having trouble with jquery in Chile from one specific internet provider
[14:46:24] <cancelthefuture_> getting 301 on curl for code.jquery.com
[14:47:10] <robertmaxrees> any specific url?
[14:48:25] <cancelthefuture_> code.jquery.com/jquery-2.2.4.min.js for sure and code.jquery.com as well
[14:48:32] <robertmaxrees> cancelthefuture_ https://github.com/jquery/codeorigin.jquery.com/issues/67
[14:48:44] <robertmaxrees> looks like this is where you want to be.
[14:48:46] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:49:29] <cancelthefuture_> oooOoOoo
[14:52:23] <karaburmication> just a random question in case someone can help. Does anyone know where I could find a slide plugin like this one?
[14:52:52] <robertmaxrees> karaburmication like which one?
[14:53:17] <karaburmication> robertmaxrees https://i.stack.imgur.com/lJm1j.gif
[14:53:36] <robertmaxrees> which part??
[14:53:40] <robertmaxrees> just the control itself?
[14:54:18] <karaburmication> I was thinking about the whole thing actually, the slide with all the bars and dynamic fields
[14:54:26] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[14:54:41] <robertmaxrees> gonna guess there's not a single plugin that does all of that.
[14:54:50] <robertmaxrees> could always inspect the page it's on and see what they're using.
[14:55:09] <karaburmication> I found it in few websites, some of them were Wordpress, some were not, but I guess there should be something built already
[14:55:38] <robertmaxrees> could be a collection of widgets from a framework.
[14:55:40] <karaburmication> https://wasabi.com/cloud-storage-pricing/ - mid-page section
[14:55:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah, so inspect it and see what it is :)
[14:56:10] <karaburmication> I tried but no luck :)
[14:56:14] <karaburmication> it looks custom
[14:57:03] <robertmaxrees> there's a real big hint in the console when you move one of the controls.
[14:59:06] <cancelthefuture_> robertmaxrees thank you for your help!
[14:59:13] <robertmaxrees> cancelthefuture_ sure!
[15:00:27] <karaburmication> hm... trying to see that, but given that I'm not that techy, maybe I'm missing something obvious
[15:01:04] <robertmaxrees> karaburmication are you seeing the console logs?
[15:02:03] <karaburmication> yes, something like this;
[15:02:09] <karaburmication> main.bundle.d10e5a92.js?x86315:1 main js herepricingAlt.bundle.c87ea333.js?x86315&ver=5.5.3:1 pricingAlt JS readyfaq.bundle.dec4c9de.js?x86315:1 FAQ loadedmain.bundle.d10e5a92.js?x86315:1 trueflame_calc.bundle.1d3bc677.js?x86315:1 34flame_calc.bundl
[15:02:21] <robertmaxrees> notice the filename for the js?
[15:03:12] <karaburmication> https://wasabi.com/wp-content/themes/wasabi/dist/js/pricingAlt.bundle.c87ea333.js?x86315&ver=5.5.3
[15:03:15] <karaburmication> pricingAlt.bundle?
[15:03:22] <karaburmication> I tried googling that, no luck
[15:04:10] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/kyuZJFZ.png
[15:04:23] <robertmaxrees> "flame_calc.bundle.js"
[15:04:47] <robertmaxrees> could also open that file and see what's going on internally - might find relevant clues in there.
[15:07:59] <robertmaxrees> if none of that turns up anything, it could be a paid solution or somethign they developed in house.
[15:08:35] <karaburmication> baby steps for now, https://jsfiddle.net/sxuetg07/#&togetherjs=iT8GDLLeN4
[15:08:59] <robertmaxrees> ?
[15:09:04] <karaburmication> don't laugh, I have no clue how this works, but was hoping I can just copy paste the whole thing and then find a way to customize it :)
[15:09:12] <robertmaxrees> mind just saving the fiddle and sending that out?
[15:09:16] <robertmaxrees> togetherJS bugs out.
[15:10:01] <karaburmication> saving the fiddle? Let me see what that means
[15:10:33] <robertmaxrees> just press "save" and then share the link.
[15:10:36] <robertmaxrees> no "collaborate"
[15:10:43] <karaburmication> I did that already
[15:10:45] <karaburmication> ah, ok
[15:10:48] <karaburmication> no collaborate
[15:11:19] <karaburmication> https://jsfiddle.net/karaburmication/vk2expod/
[15:12:59] <karaburmication> not sure if css will make some big change to this, but I believe it looks pretty static for now :)
[15:13:05] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[15:13:18] <karaburmication> maybe I didn't copy the whole thing
[15:13:20] <robertmaxrees> did you just cope this off that site?
[15:13:22] <robertmaxrees> yeah, no.
[15:13:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:13:26] <robertmaxrees> not gonna work.
[15:13:35] <robertmaxrees> that's been packaged for delivery to the browser.
[15:13:58] <karaburmication> ok, so we're sure it was custom built and can't be found elsewhere
[15:14:07] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i'm saying at all.
[15:14:13] <robertmaxrees> when did anybody suggest that?
[15:14:26] <karaburmication> forgot a question mark
[15:14:31] <karaburmication> ok, so we're sure it was custom built and can't be found elsewhere??? :)
[15:14:38] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:14:40] <robertmaxrees> we're not
[15:15:14] <robertmaxrees> it could be a collection of plugins or libraries, free or paid.  could be part of a wordpress theme.  could be an in-house developed solution.
[15:15:15] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[15:17:04] <karaburmication> yeah, but would it be ok to assume that I won't be able to just inspect the page and figure out what they have been using to build it?
[15:17:18] <karaburmication> I was kinda hoping I'll find a plugin or something that is publicly available
[15:17:24] <karaburmication> but seems like it isn't like that
[15:17:39] <robertmaxrees> might not be in this particular case.
[15:18:01] <robertmaxrees> looks relatively straightforward to setup though.  slider control that changes a bar graph.
[15:19:02] <karaburmication> that was the argument I used in the first place to assume this should be publicly available
[15:19:12] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:19:54] <karaburmication> there are plenty of calculator plugins online, it is hard for me to think that none of them has this basic ability to graphically display the results
[15:20:09] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things :)
[15:20:10] <karaburmication> so I assumed it's a well-known plugin
[15:20:34] <robertmaxrees> there are libraries and plugins available for things like bar charts and sliders.
[15:20:43] <robertmaxrees> publicly, even.
[15:20:53] <karaburmication> if I were a dev, I would built this in a pretty straightforward way:
[15:21:03] <karaburmication> 1 - slide
[15:21:06] <robertmaxrees> are you not a dev?
[15:21:31] <karaburmication> 2 - simple calculations for each bar (slide value X something)
[15:21:45] <karaburmication> 3 - graph that inherits the calculated value :)
[15:21:57] <robertmaxrees> cool - sounds like you know how to build it then!
[15:21:57] <karaburmication> so that's why I assumed this was already built and I just need to find it
[15:22:01] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[15:22:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah, just because something seems "simple" or w/e doesn't mean "somebody's made it and open-sourced it"
[15:22:32] <robertmaxrees> also: maybe somebody HAS built one.  could use google :)
[15:22:34] <robertmaxrees> or roll your own.
[15:22:38] <karaburmication> nope, not a dev, just someone who is looking if there's a plugin that does this thing
[15:23:06] <karaburmication> I spent hours testing different "calculator plugins", and finally landed here to see if I can get some new idea or support
[15:23:11] <karaburmication> thanks for your assistance on this one
[15:23:31] <robertmaxrees> ah.  well if i were a brain surgeon, it'd to brain surgery in a pretty straightforward way: 1 - cut open skull. 2 - remove problem area. 3 - place skull back. :)
[15:23:45] <robertmaxrees> *i'd do
[15:24:43] <karaburmication> using your analogy, I just came here to speak with a brain surgeon and ask him if there's some well-known machine that opens skulls
[15:25:02] <robertmaxrees> also: seeing tons of hits on google for "javascript bar chart slider"
[15:25:08] <robertmaxrees> should be some solid ideas in there :)
[15:25:49] <MassDebates> canvasjs
[15:25:54] <karaburmication> thanks, I'll take a look
[15:26:03] <robertmaxrees> canvasjs, highcharts iirc.  d3.
[15:26:06] <robertmaxrees> lots of options.
[15:26:08] <MassDebates> oooh d3
[15:26:11] <MassDebates> powerful
[15:26:20] <MassDebates> but iirc canvasjs is also uh
[15:26:23] <MassDebates> jqueryfied or whatever
[15:26:29] <MassDebates> so bonus points if you're used to jquery already
[15:27:10] <robertmaxrees> sure, if you wanna spend at least $150 touse it.
[15:32:34] <karaburmication> thanks guys, I'll look into these js sliders and see if I can find something similar
[15:33:41] <MassDebates> I'm on the chat with their support
[15:33:49] <MassDebates> robertmaxrees, check this out:
[15:33:50] <MassDebates> "HighCharts and D3 are based on SVG which has serious performance-related issues, whereas CanvasJS is based on Canvas which performs much better as compared to SVG."
[15:34:11] <robertmaxrees> MassDebates sure?
[15:34:26] <robertmaxrees> doesn't change the fact that they cost money :)
[15:34:38] <MassDebates> I never thought of SVG as slow tbh
[15:34:46] <robertmaxrees> (it's not if you do it right)
[15:34:51] <MassDebates> ikr
[15:35:05] <MassDebates> They say canvas is better but that doesn't seem right to me
[15:35:10] <MassDebates> maybe for really really really complicated stuff
[15:36:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm sure they have some measurements for some cases on some browsers/datasets/whatever that agree with them.
[15:36:14] <MassDebates> yeah
[16:11:05] <anli> Is there a plunker/jsfiddle etc site that can let you get a fullscreen version of a webpage?
[16:12:45] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[16:12:55] <robertmaxrees> like, run a sample as if it were a page?
[16:15:08] <robertmaxrees> anli
[17:09:42] <sydbarret> how can i change some properties of the object called data here https://bpa.st/MH7Q ?
[17:09:55] <sydbarret>  data.search.search.replace('\\b', '');  doesnt seem to work
[17:10:00] <robertmaxrees> ask in ##javascript :)
