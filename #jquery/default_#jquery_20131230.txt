[00:03:26] <hackable> why, everything is cold in here...
[00:09:55] <amh345> i've got a setInterval that fades in an image repeated on some classes.  I'm wondering. is there a way to stagger these so they don't all fadein and out at the same time?
[00:10:04] <amh345> here's the jquery.   setInterval(function() { $(".some_class").fadeIn(500).delay(2000).fadeOut(500); }, 5000);
[00:11:35] <amh345> maybe .each through the classes and at... 5000+1000 or something.
[00:11:40] <amh345> not sure if that's the best way.
[00:29:31] <fabioportieri> morning
[01:42:00] <shahin8r> http://pastebin.com/s4tca6kM <- I'm guessing this is the wrong way to animate back to original width and height but can't seem to really figure out what I'm doing wrong. Any help?
[02:14:12] <bigbugjava> Hi all of yaa
[02:29:34] <bigbugjava> guys anyone has an idea for a file uploader, tried blueimp and plupload with tons of erroes (using Node.js)
[02:41:42] <fabioportieri> bigbugjava: i think you should use express for node.js
[02:46:26] <bigbugjava> fabioportieri using it
[03:24:59] <ripthejacker> How can I simulate tab key press using jquery.
[03:25:55] <ripthejacker> I want to swtich focus to the next tabindex using the 'down' arrow key instead of 'tab' key. Is there an easy way to do this?
[03:31:45] <fabioportieri> ripthejacker: just call .trigger("focus") or .focus() on the element you want inside the keypress event handler, if keyCode = 'downArrowKeyCodeICantRemember'
[03:32:29] <fabioportieri> probably keyup instead of keypress
[03:33:01] <ripthejacker> fabioportieri: It would've worked easily if the tabindexes wered numbered regularly, but in my case it's not, it's 100,101,102,200,201 .....
[03:34:28] <fabioportieri> looks like you may need to traverse the entire dom and storing the tabindexes in an hashmap and then sort it.. too much of a pain for that feature if you ask me
[03:34:44] <fabioportieri> what's wrong with the old tab?
[03:36:42] <ripthejacker> tab is ok, but to go reverse, you need shift+tab
[03:36:56] <ripthejacker> I want to use up and down instead.
[03:56:15] <decap> Im having a issue with mobile jquery when I do $.mobile.changePage('index.php'); and when the page loads I'm having a trouble  with "append" . "append" doesn't work in the page
[03:56:36] <decap> again when I refresh the page append works fine
[04:05:37] * decap anyone ?
[04:08:28] <weeb1e> Hi everyone, When I create a new element with $('<a/>') and then use .click to register a click event callback, it does not work unless I delay the .click(function() { }) call until later (after the element has been appended to the page body I assume)
[04:08:57] <weeb1e> Using a timer to delay registering the click callback solves the issue, but I can't understand why I am experiencing this issue to begin with
[04:09:20] <weeb1e> As far as I know, you should be able to register a click callback on a newly created element before it has been appended to the page body?
[04:10:05] <fabioportieri> no no use .on in the delegation form weeb1e
[04:10:23] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: I'll try that
[04:10:44] <Uhkis> what's the difference?
[04:10:44] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: No change
[04:11:07] <weeb1e> It still doesn't work unless I delay it until after the element has been appended
[04:11:10] <fabioportieri> you need to use delegation for attaching events to future elements
[04:11:13] <fabioportieri> paste code
[04:11:35] <weeb1e> Meh, I'd have to try put together a test case, which could take a bit of effort
[04:11:52] <weeb1e> It is currently part of a large, closed access, alpha application
[04:12:37] <weeb1e> It doesn't make sense, but I'm pretty close to just adding a timer to workaround the issue
[04:13:15] <weeb1e> I can't afford to waste much more time with this issue, but I would really like to get to the bottom of it
[04:14:30] <weeb1e> Pity there is no cross browser event for when an element is attached to the DOM
[04:18:26] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: In the same way, setting a data attribute to an object before the element is appended doesn't work
[04:19:12] <weeb1e> Otherwise I could have delegated the click to document and used the data attribute to give it context
[04:19:22] <weeb1e> This thing really seems to have something against me
[04:20:09] <oliwe> how do you delay a loop?
[04:20:33] <oliwe> i want to run a ajax connection and i want to do something every 2 seconds until its done
[04:20:46] <oliwe> nvm i just realized what to do
[04:20:49] <weeb1e> oliwe: setInterval
[04:21:17] <oliwe> yeah i know that, then i'll just make it exit whenever the ajax changes a variable to true or whatever
[04:21:19] <oliwe> that should work right
[04:21:39] <weeb1e> Sure, something like that
[04:25:31] <spygame> hey guys, i'm using jquery datetimepicker http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ and i'm getting this error Object [object Object] has no method 'getFullYear', my js file looks like this: https://gist.github.com/mfa213/8181530 any suggestions
[04:25:31] <spygame> ?
[04:34:14] <fabioportieri> which framework is that? document.querySelectorAll
[04:34:30] <grafi> its called javascript
[04:34:32] <grafi> o.o
[04:35:13] <fabioportieri> ah, never used that .query stuff.. thanks
[04:37:03] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: If you're still around, I've put together a test case
[04:37:15] <fabioportieri> yeah show us
[04:37:28] <weeb1e> It is just a bit ugly, since I have copy pasted pieces of compiled CoffeeScript code
[04:37:38] <weeb1e> I added a setTimeout now to make it work (after 1 second)
[04:37:40] <grafi> wohooo coffee
[04:37:48] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: http://jsfiddle.net/2Jmf8/
[04:38:15] <weeb1e> The code registering the click callback is in "build_nickname = function(nickname) {"
[04:42:08] <fabioportieri> you're mixing sync and async stuff
[04:42:24] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: Such as?
[04:43:02] <fabioportieri> $elements.append(build_nickname(part));
[04:43:16] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: How is appending an element async?
[04:43:36] <fabioportieri> in build_nickname i removed the settimeout and now it's stuck on ...loading
[04:43:39] <weeb1e> Everything in that code is synchronous, callbacks are obviously async but registration is synchronous?
[04:43:45] <fabioportieri> appending is sync indeed
[04:43:53] <fabioportieri> uhmm
[04:44:12] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: Try run again, it works for me if I remove the setTimeout, it just doesn't ever call the callback
[04:44:17] <fabioportieri> no nevermind
[04:44:19] <fabioportieri> it works here
[04:44:21] <fabioportieri> i think
[04:44:27] <weeb1e> Including the callback?
[04:44:32] <weeb1e> That can't be...
[04:44:34] <fabioportieri> http://jsfiddle.net/2Jmf8/2/
[04:44:54] <fabioportieri> try this if it works for you
[04:44:55] <weeb1e> That cannot work for me fabioportieri
[04:45:38] <weeb1e> That was what I was originally doing, but since data attributes fail to be set for the same strange reason, I have no way of linking the context of the user variable with that callback fabioportieri
[04:45:50] <fabioportieri> ah
[04:46:04] <weeb1e> If you can get the user variables value set to a data attribute on the element, then it can work
[04:46:20] <weeb1e> But for some reason, nothing seems to work without first appending the element to the page
[04:46:30] <weeb1e> And I am out of ideas on how to workaround the issue
[04:46:37] <weeb1e> If anyone here has any suggestions, please let me know!
[04:46:53] <grafi> stunned by the code :P
[04:46:58] <fabioportieri> so you want user = {nickname: 'test'};
[04:47:13] <fabioportieri> the code is quite messy
[04:47:31] <fabioportieri> to be referenced inside the callback so the alert would display test instead of nickname?
[04:48:33] <fabioportieri> did i understood ?
[04:54:31] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: Yes, that variable (which is just a stub for the real object that would be used)
[04:54:55] <fabioportieri> ok then you need a closure i guess
[04:55:03] <weeb1e> And yeah grafi, the code would be messy, especially since it's generated from CoffeeScript
[04:55:23] <grafi> oh sure, still :P
[04:55:39] <grafi> creating an element + attaching data or click handlers should work
[04:55:47] <grafi> not sure where it breaks in your code though
[04:55:49] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: You realize: 1) The function is already a closure. 2) How does a closure help if registering the callback does not work
[04:56:10] <weeb1e> grafi: Sure it _should_, but clearly it does not :(
[04:56:28] <weeb1e> Hence why something that should be fairly simple, it wasting endless amounts of my time
[04:56:31] <fabioportieri> the callback isn't registered  ?
[04:56:41] <fabioportieri> it is called here
[04:57:02] <weeb1e> You can see yourself when you remove setTimeout from my original example fabioportieri
[04:57:08] <weeb1e> The callback is not called
[04:57:21] <weeb1e> (without your changes, which breaks everything)
[04:57:21] <fabioportieri> it's called here..
[04:57:37] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: Save and link me to what works for you
[04:59:08] <weeb1e> grafi: On another note, if you have wrapped your head around the code and what it does, feel free to suggest a better method of going about doing that :P
[04:59:10] <fabioportieri> the callback you mean open_private_message_window ?
[04:59:25] <fabioportieri> or the click callback
[04:59:32] <weeb1e> The click callback
[04:59:40] <weeb1e> Which shows an alert
[04:59:45] <fabioportieri> http://jsfiddle.net/2Jmf8/2/
[04:59:48] <fabioportieri> the one i linked before?
[04:59:50] <weeb1e> It does not ever work, without a setTimeout delay on the click registration
[05:00:09] <weeb1e> <weeb1e> That cannot work for me fabioportieri
[05:00:09] <weeb1e> <weeb1e> That was what I was originally doing, but since data attributes fail to be set for the same strange reason, I have no way of linking the context of the user variable with that callback fabioportieri
[05:00:18] <weeb1e> I already explained why your "fix" cannot work
[05:00:25] <weeb1e> It loses context of user
[05:01:10] <fabioportieri> mm one moment then
[05:01:24] <weeb1e> To be clear: Your "solution" would use the last user built for every single nickname clicked, which would completely defeat the point
[05:02:16] <fabioportieri> weeb1e: that's why i said you need a closure
[05:02:29] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: You are not understanding.
[05:02:52] <weeb1e> You are registering a callback for _every_ nickname clicked, not only the one associated with that user
[05:03:02] <weeb1e> It doesn't matter if there is a closure, it will not work correctly ever
[05:04:18] <weeb1e> I need to either: a) Do that, but also set the user variable to a data attribute on the element so that the callback has the correct contexts user. or b) Register the click callback for only the specific element built like my original example (which doesn't work)
[05:04:50] <weeb1e> Both of those solutions are impossible without the click callback registration or data attribute setting working before the element is appended to the page
[05:04:54] <weeb1e> And I have no idea why
[05:05:27] <weeb1e> If anyone here has a suggestion for a 3rd option, or better let an idea why both of those solutions do not work, please let me know
[05:05:35] <weeb1e> *better yet
[05:07:54] <fabioportieri> you tried .data() ?
[05:09:40] <weeb1e> Yes, I tried that a long time ago, before I tried doing this link of click registration, and it fails just like click does
[05:10:03] <weeb1e> If anyone is going to try solve this issue, please look at http://jsfiddle.net/2Jmf8/3/
[05:10:19] <weeb1e> I have changed "nickname" to "nickname1" and "nickname2"
[05:10:42] <weeb1e> Clicking on each nickname needs to open an alert with the correct nickname printed
[05:11:11] <weeb1e> Just like it does in that example, but without the setTimeout delay workaround that is currently required to get the click callback to register successfully
[05:11:13] <fabioportieri> what about .attr("data-stuff",... ?
[05:11:24] <fabioportieri> even if it's dirty
[05:12:13] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: Pretty sure attr() cannot work with objects like data() can. Keep in mind, I don't just need the data attribute to store the nickname but a reference to the user object which can change between that data attribute being set and the callback firing
[05:12:47] <fabioportieri> right you need an object..
[05:13:08] <weeb1e> I get the feeling I'm going to have to ask about this issue again in 10 hours or something, this channel seems to be very quiet
[05:14:24] <weeb1e> I'm even starting to think jquery is bugged or something
[05:17:00] <fabioportieri> can't you setup the callback after you append it into the dom so your' data will be available?
[05:18:03] <oliwe> woo
[05:18:05] <oliwe> i made it spin
[05:18:09] <oliwe> http://film.no-ip.org/rolig/
[05:18:15] <oliwe> while loading from random.org
[05:18:27] <oliwe> so it just continues spinning while loading
[05:18:28] <oliwe> looks great
[05:18:28] <oliwe> :D
[05:18:48] <dblosevn> thats sweet
[05:19:28] <oliwe> hmm its bugging a bit
[05:19:47] <weeb1e> fabioportieri: That build_nickname function is called from many places, moving click callback registration out of the function would require lots of extra code which would not be at all DRY and from what I understand should be completely unnecessary
[05:20:04] <weeb1e> Someone must know what the issue is, but it seems no one that is around does :(
[05:21:20] <dblosevn> weeb1e: someone must :-), im lazy got a link and a 30 word explantion of that your issue is lol
[05:22:33] <weeb1e> dblosevn: http://jsfiddle.net/2Jmf8/3/ -- I need the exact behaviour shown in that example when you click on "nickname1" and "nickname2" under Output, but without the setTimeout hack that is commented in that code
[05:23:22] <weeb1e> In that example, registering a click callback or setting a data attribute to an object does not work until after the element is appended to the page, which makes no sense and breaks the only two options I know of for accomplishing that that does
[05:23:35] <weeb1e> *what that does
[05:23:35] <oliwe> is there a problem calling a variable second?
[05:23:55] <weeb1e> oliwe: No
[05:23:59] <dblosevn> oliwe: like is second a reserved keyword?
[05:24:10] <dblosevn> if so, then no it is not
[05:24:17] <weeb1e> (that is what I assumed he meant)
[05:24:28] <oliwe> its weird cause im calling a function using (first, second) the function picks up on it
[05:24:32] <oliwe> but it always breaks on second
[05:24:35] <oliwe> and not the first
[05:24:39] <oliwe> it just says its unset
[05:24:49] <oliwe> im 100% sure its set
[05:24:55] <dblosevn> its not the name, somewhere your passing an undefined in
[05:25:11] <oliwe> yeah iunno where though
[05:25:14] <oliwe> the code is the same for both
[05:25:15] <dblosevn> console.log(arguments); in the function
[05:25:43] <weeb1e> dblosevn: Sorry for the messy test case code, it's mostly copied from CoffeeScript output. Please let me know if you have any ideas about the issue
[05:25:54] <dblosevn> if its truly undefined there then... debugger;console.log(arguments); and look at the call stack
[05:26:28] <dblosevn> weeb1e: my brain hurts looking at the, what function am I supossed to be looking at
[05:26:47] <weeb1e> build_nickname = function
[05:27:33] <dblosevn> weeb1e: I have had this issue before
[05:27:42] <dblosevn> pretty simple fix if I rememebr correctly
[05:27:48] <weeb1e> What is the cause?
[05:27:59] <oliwe> dblosevn where should i look
[05:28:07] <oliwe> calee?
[05:28:56] <oliwe> actually seems random
[05:28:59] <oliwe> http://film.no-ip.org/rolig/
[05:29:32] <oliwe> does it have something to do with my var second in the midspin function?
[05:29:36] <oliwe> all the js is in the index
[05:29:42] <dblosevn> oliwe: a requires the href attrib
[05:29:48] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/2Jmf8/4/
[05:30:00] <oliwe> wat
[05:30:11] <dblosevn> sorry it cleared my code
[05:30:42] <oliwe> i dont even have an a
[05:31:14] <dblosevn> $nickname is an anchor
[05:32:21] <weeb1e> oliwe: That is for me, not you
[05:32:27] <oliwe> ah key
[05:32:42] <FrankDWork> so I have this table content that I want a user to be able to copy + paste but the formatting as plaintext is beyond horrendous
[05:32:53] <dblosevn> crap clicked the worng name :-)
[05:32:54] <FrankDWork> is there a good way around that? looks like I can't inject directly to the users clipboard
[05:32:58] <weeb1e> dblosevn: That does nothing at all to solve the issue...
[05:33:17] <dblosevn> ya I thought I did but the setimeout came back and I didnt catch it
[05:33:38] <weeb1e> Yeah, no dice :(
[05:33:51] <weeb1e> There must be something more to this
[05:34:06] <dblosevn> where is this function used?
[05:34:21] <weeb1e> Either a) It is impossible to set data attributes or register click callbacks before an element is appended to the page
[05:34:32] <weeb1e> Or b) The code/jquery is broken
[05:34:43] <dblosevn> weeb1e: a, false, b unlikely
[05:34:48] <weeb1e> And from what people keep telling me, it can't be A
[05:35:00] <dblosevn> Ive done it countless times
[05:35:01] <weeb1e> So this is slowly driving me demented
[05:35:09] <dblosevn> and I do it with jquery :-)
[05:35:20] <weeb1e> build_nickname is called from many places, which is why it needs to do the registration of that callback
[05:35:37] <dblosevn> ya, I need to see one of thoughs places
[05:35:39] <weeb1e> Or at the very least, it needs to set a data attribute to the user variable
[05:35:53] <weeb1e> Which also fails for the same unknown reason, which no one can figure out
[05:36:08] <weeb1e> dblosevn: The test case uses it twice...
[05:36:31] <weeb1e> Just search for "build_nickname" in the pasted code, if you don't want to read through it all
[05:37:25] <dblosevn> I did I only see it twice
[05:37:48] <dblosevn> looks like your initalizing it in one place and defining it in another
[05:38:03] <weeb1e> It's only used twice by the code that is pasted
[05:38:13] <weeb1e> Which is all that is relevant to this issue anyway
[05:38:36] <weeb1e> If it works in those two places, it'll work in other places it is used, but so far, it does not work at all
[05:38:40] <dblosevn> by the way, heres an example of a project I am currently building that does just what your asking using jquery :-) http://lxedev.com/calcgap/js/app.js  lines 275-287
[05:39:12] <weeb1e> Yeah I have no doubt about that dblosevn, I also have done this myself in the past
[05:39:23] <weeb1e> But that still doesn't explain why my example test case fails
[05:39:25] <oliwe> well i fixed my thing
[05:39:32] <oliwe> haha just did 20 spins without fault
[05:39:34] <weeb1e> But thanks for trying to figure it out anyway
[05:39:35] <oliwe> did one just now
[05:39:36] <oliwe> didnt work
[05:39:36] <oliwe> :c
[05:39:54] <oliwe> i dont get it
[05:39:54] <dblosevn> the readability of this is impossible :-(
[05:40:00] <weeb1e> Hopefully if I ask every ~30 minutes in this channel, someone will be able to figure it out within the next few days :/
[05:40:41] <weeb1e> dblosevn: I basically never deal with plain js, since even clean hand written js is ugly and verbose compared to CoffeeScript
[05:41:14] <weeb1e> It really isn't all that bad though
[05:41:39] <weeb1e> It does a lot for the amount of code, and is recursive, which will obviously make it harder to follow
[05:41:59] <weeb1e> There isn't much you can do about that, other than wrap your head around the recursive flow, as is the case with any recursive code
[05:42:31] <weeb1e> But regardless, the issue makes no sense
[05:43:11] <dblosevn> im still trying to figure out where in this mess this function is actually called, also where the element is injected
[05:43:33] <dblosevn> lie 16-17 is cryptic as hell
[05:43:59] <weeb1e> You can ignore that dblosevn
[05:44:17] <weeb1e> That is just variable declarations
[05:44:30] <dblosevn> then where is the function call? that function name only appears on line 16 and 37
[05:44:48] <krastavac> why i have [14:46:08.872] GET http://127.0.0.1/aaa/json.txt?x=12345 [HTTP/1.1 200 OK 6ms] and no data with getJson() ?
[05:44:57] <weeb1e> 16 is not a call, just a declaration
[05:45:08] <dblosevn> neither is 37
[05:45:14] <dblosevn> so where is the call
[05:45:28] <weeb1e> line 89 and 97
[05:45:33] <weeb1e> Those are the two places it is called
[05:46:29] <dblosevn> weird, I didnt have that line until I refreshed,
[05:46:34] <dblosevn> jsfiddle is acting wacky
[05:47:07] <dblosevn> or possibly I should close one of my 200 tabs lol
[05:47:09] <weeb1e> Oh, damn
[05:47:32] <weeb1e> I have like 200 applications each with their own 200 tabs open :/
[05:47:35] <weeb1e> Really need more ram
[05:48:24] <weeb1e> Well, I guess the issue must be somewhere where the elements are pulled apart and put back together
[05:49:31] <weeb1e> I'd love a simpler way of accomplishing all this
[05:49:41] <weeb1e> But so far, I have been unable to come up with any
[05:55:01] <weeb1e> Then again, that doesn't explain how delay solves the issue
[05:55:07] <weeb1e> I really cannot make sense of this
[05:55:24] <grafi> not?
[05:55:46] <weeb1e> It looks like this is what is breaking it:
[05:55:48] <weeb1e> $el.children().each(function() { return $(this).replaceWith($(this)); });
[05:55:55] <grafi> might
[05:56:01] <weeb1e> Yet if there is delay before the callback is registered, it works
[05:56:05] <weeb1e> Which doesn't make sense?
[05:56:06] <dblosevn> ya
[05:56:13] <dblosevn> replaceWith doesnt copy handlers
[05:56:30] <weeb1e> So how can I copy handlers after using replaceWith?
[05:56:34] <dblosevn> and it makes perfect sense, the handler is attached after the element is replaced
[05:56:57] <dblosevn> I just typed your code line by line into the console
[05:57:01] <dblosevn> worked great
[05:57:09] <dblosevn> injected in the dom and the click handler worked
[05:57:19] <weeb1e> I was thinking the reference to the origional element was completely lost after replaceWith, but if only the handlers are lost, then it does make sense
[05:57:35] <dblosevn> so something that happens outside of the build_nick... function is removing the handlers
[05:57:36] <weeb1e> But then how do I programatically copy all event handlers?
[05:57:55] <oliwe> oh
[05:57:58] <oliwe> godammit
[05:58:01] <oliwe> i found out what my problem was
[05:58:02] <weeb1e> dblosevn: I just made a minimal test case to trace it back to replaceWith
[05:58:08] <weeb1e> var $a = $('<a/>').text("CLICK ME").click(function() { alert("CLICKED"); });
[05:58:08] <weeb1e> var $el = $('<div/>').append('Prefix').append($a).append('Suffix');
[05:58:08] <weeb1e> /$el.children().each(function() { return $(this).replaceWith($(this)); });
[05:58:08] <weeb1e> $('#output').html($el);
[05:58:18] <oliwe> i have 16 objects in my array, i was doing a random number between 0 and 16
[05:58:20] <oliwe> lel
[05:58:23] <weeb1e> That / line should be a comment
[05:58:25] <oliwe> atleast i cleaned up my code
[05:58:53] <weeb1e> Anyone know of a way to programmatically copy all event handlers to another element?
[05:59:34] <dblosevn> there really isnt a way
[05:59:53] <dblosevn> being the handler is the same anyways though I would just create a delegated listener and call it a day
[06:00:59] <weeb1e> a delegated listener?
[06:01:01] <dblosevn> jQuery('#output').on('click', 'a.nickname', function() { });
[06:01:05] <weeb1e> What do you mean exactly
[06:01:10] <weeb1e> The issue is context dblosevn
[06:01:23] <weeb1e> I wanted to do that from the start, in fact that was my initial implementation
[06:01:31] <weeb1e> The issue is, replaceWith loses data attributes too
[06:01:41] <dblosevn> ya because your replacing the element
[06:01:42] <weeb1e> So I can't store a reference to the user object as a data attribute
[06:02:04] <weeb1e> So even if I go back to that method, I need to copy data attributes across when using replaceWith
[06:02:25] <dblosevn> well there is a way to preserve your data
[06:03:02] <weeb1e> That should be a lot easier than event handlers though
[06:03:11] <weeb1e> Since data attributes can be gotten with $el.data()
[06:03:18] <weeb1e> (all data attributes)
[06:03:29] <weeb1e> So finally, it sounds like we have a solution
[06:10:56] <jjenzz> @weeb1e: hate to ask you to repeat yourself but I've come in a bit late to the convo… what are you trying to do?
[06:11:44] <weeb1e> jjenzz: I have finally found a possible solution, so it isn't really an issue
[06:12:00] <weeb1e> Though if you happen to know of a way to programmatically copy all event handlers from one element to another, let me know
[06:12:04] <jjenzz> weeb1e: fair dos
[06:13:01] <jjenzz> weeb1e: I'm assuming someone has already suggested delegation
[06:13:28] <weeb1e> jjenzz: That is the solution I am almost done implementing, copying data attributes over after using replaceWith
[06:14:00] <jjenzz> Can I see some example code of what you're trying to do?
[06:14:09] <weeb1e> But in case there is a case where it makes sense to rather not use a delegation handler and data variables in the future, it would be useful to know of a way to copy over event handlers after using replaceWith
[06:14:24] <weeb1e> jjenzz: Not unless you want your eyeballs to start bleeding :(
[06:14:32] <jjenzz> Haha!
[06:14:34] <weeb1e> My test case is from compiled CoffeeScript
[06:14:47] <jjenzz> I do love a bit of gore
[06:14:54] <jjenzz> Ah…
[06:14:59] <weeb1e> jjenzz: http://jsfiddle.net/2Jmf8/3/
[06:15:08] <weeb1e> Search for replaceWith to see what I need to do
[06:20:52] <weeb1e> jjenzz: On the off chance you manage to wrap your head around all that code and can think of a better way of going about it all, feel free to let me know :)
[06:24:22] <jjenzz> weeb1e: I'll take a look, but what is the description of the original problem you are trying to solve?
[06:24:53] <weeb1e> jjenzz: The issue which I have already solved, or the purpose of all that code?
[06:25:10] <jjenzz> weeb1e: the purpose..
[06:27:24] <jjenzz> weeb1e: also, could you put your CoffeeScript on here instead? http://jsbin.com/ … might be easier to pick apart
[06:30:43] <weeb1e> jjenzz: It recursively walks through an input of one or more elements with one or more child elements (which usually make up the body of chat messages), converts formatting from IRC byte based formatting to HTML, finds any online nicknames inside parts of the element body and turns them into a elements which are associated to a reference to the corresponding users object (so that the reference is valid across nick changes)
[06:32:23] <weeb1e> It's currently a fairly rought prototype, which has one or more bugs, but mostly does what I need
[06:32:29] <weeb1e> *rough
[06:33:13] <weeb1e> After implementing my solution for my earlier issue, it doesn't seem to be working, so either I have made a mistake somewhere or replaceWith() is not the only thing causing data loss
[06:36:45] <weeb1e> jjenzz: Here is the coffeescript for reading purposes, I haven't included helper functions and stuff to make it be able to run: http://jsbin.com/evEBaFUk/1/edit?js
[06:37:05] <weeb1e> I have to run out quick, but I'll be back in about 40 minutes or so
[06:37:38] <weeb1e> If you have any suggestions for me, I'd appriciate it, I can't help but feel there should be an easier way of accomplishing this
[06:37:48] <weeb1e> *appreciate
[06:56:04] <SuperTyp> hey ya beautiful people
[06:56:15] <SuperTyp> I have this website: http://vfrbb.de
[06:56:31] <SuperTyp> and implemented the jquery tooltipster plugin
[06:56:49] <SuperTyp> why doesn't it work on Chrome? And why doenst it show me any errors?
[06:57:09] <SuperTyp> If you hover of the "Anleitung" big fat box the tooltip should appear
[06:57:18] <SuperTyp> In FF it works well
[06:57:42] <SuperTyp> IE too
[06:59:24] <shoky> SuperTyp: it's working for me in chrome
[06:59:57] <grafi> does work on chrome for me as well
[07:00:09] <SuperTyp> hm strange...on my girlfriends laptop as well
[07:00:15] <SuperTyp> I am on a surface Pro
[07:00:24] <SuperTyp> Do you have windows 8?
[07:00:55] <shoky> 7
[07:01:08] <shoky> something on your site is making it respond very slow tho
[07:01:36] <SuperTyp> yeah I know it is not good coded
[07:02:06] <SuperTyp> but is enough for my purpose
[07:02:16] <SuperTyp> runs faster on IE
[07:02:22] <shoky> don't use setInterval(.., 50)
[07:02:30] <shoky> for animating stuff
[07:02:36] <SuperTyp> what is better?
[07:03:25] <shoky> i wanna say requestAnimationFrame but now i'm not sure if that's also used for canvas animations
[07:03:51] <shoky> but in any case, calling setTimeout repeatedly is usually better
[07:04:09] <SuperTyp> would I have to change anything else too or only that function?
[07:05:04] <shoky> also it seems you're re-creating all the Image objects and stuff, on EACH frame
[07:05:59] <shoky> you'd have to read how to use that function
[07:08:09] <shoky> hm why do you even have a setInterval at all? i don't see anything being animated
[07:08:27] <shoky> only in response to mouse events
[07:08:50] <krastavac> i made test case, here it is http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20841672/cant-get-json-data-from-localhost-file-ajax-jquery
[07:09:08] <SuperTyp> shoky I only draw the images and stuff once
[07:09:16] <SuperTyp> the setInterval isnt used acutally
[07:09:20] <SuperTyp> yeah you already wrote it :D
[07:11:49] <SuperTyp> requestAnimationFrame is a nice api though
[07:12:31] <shoky> SuperTyp: oh ok, my bad sry
[07:13:01] <SuperTyp> not need to excuse thanks for looking into my code and giving me some tipps <3
[07:13:03] <shoky> krastavac: what's textStatus and err in the error callback?  use console.log  not alert
[07:17:03] <krastavac> SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON data
[07:17:33] <krastavac> parseerror
[07:17:39] <shoky> ok there you go.
[07:17:56] <krastavac> is there validation function in js?
[07:18:08] <krastavac> for json
[07:18:41] <shoky> jquery's calling JSON.parse which is already doing the validation for you
[07:19:16] <shoky> check your json file's end.. look at the request in your browser's devtools network tab
[07:19:32] <shoky> look at the json response there, see if your server maybe added something on the end
[07:20:18] <shoky> krastavac but the JSON you pasted is valid. so your server must be returning something a bit different
[07:20:26] <shoky> or something even weirder is going on
[07:21:38] <krastavac> ???
[07:21:57] <shoky> writing ??? is very helpful, yes
[07:22:12] <krastavac> added spaces in the end, same
[07:22:16] <shoky> huh
[07:22:21] <shoky> don't add anything at the end
[07:22:35] <shoky> look at your browser's devtools network tab (press F12.. )
[07:22:54] <shoky> look at the actual ajax request and what the server response is
[07:23:44] <krastavac> ok
[07:24:19] <krastavac> nothing in firefox on F12
[07:24:31] <krastavac> ff22
[07:25:15] <krastavac> should i install livehttp headers addon?
[07:25:25] <shoky> go to firefox menu -> Web Developer -> Network
[07:25:29] <shoky> no
[07:27:49] <krastavac> no Network option there
[07:28:20] <krastavac> shift+F12 opens some black task bar at bottom
[07:28:41] <shoky> ugh
[07:28:52] <shoky> install a newer ff, or firebug, or chrome
[07:29:10] <clime> Hey I am getting a peculiar error: GET blob:http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8008/d405436e-faae-434d-a353-960a9acc5700 404 (Not Found) jquery-1.10.2.min.js:5   on this line:   previews.after(data.context). Anyone has an idea how to get rid of this. The images (blobs) in data.context are actually shown in the page but the error is occuring nevertheless.
[07:33:19] <krastavac> its from FF23
[07:33:31] <krastavac> what should I look for... headers and bodies?
[07:33:44] <shoky> response body
[07:33:52] <krastavac> ok
[07:37:28] <krastavac> can I see body with this one? https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/live-http-headers/
[07:38:16] <shoky> no
[07:38:29] <shoky> i told you what you need..
[07:44:46] <weeb1e> jjenzz: I am around again, in case you have taken a look at that code
[07:49:02] <clime> the blob error is really weird. It does not occur if I add the images this way:  options.filesContainer.prepend(data.context) - i.e. if I use the prepend method the GET error does not occur on the blob. If I try to insert the image _after_ some other images in the container, the error does occur. I suspect it has something to do with cloning...but not really sure. Sry, I can't provide more info.
[07:49:50] <clime> This is an image from data.context: <img src="blob:http%3A//127.0.0.1%3A8008/ebf753a2-bb57-472f-9028-1f491404545f" width="219" height="164">
[07:52:58] <clime> probably, it is because the src of the already added images is reeavulated each time a new image is added (the appending to the container does not do that).
[07:53:20] <clime> but previews.after(data.context) does that (previews contains already added images)
[08:03:40] <clime> ye, cloning does that: $(data.context).clone();  this trows the errors well
[08:23:04] <krastavac> is there offline instaler for latest firefox?
[08:23:50] <kaaaz> Hi guys. I'm using the following script: http://jsfiddle.net/m3nE3/ to get the width of my combined .post-bg classes and then add that width to #main. However using width() doesnt seem to take into account the border on post-bg. Hope you can help, thanks!
[08:24:04] <ivymike> how can I know fi the distant server allows cross domain queries ?
[08:24:53] <tw2113> it's not some server setting, as far as i know
[08:25:53] <shoky> ivymike: if it supports CORS then you can see the server responding with cors http headers
[08:26:12] <shoky> kaaaz: you might wanna try .outerWidth()
[08:27:36] <kaaaz> shoky: just did and it makes it all looked fucked up :o
[08:28:18] <shoky> sounds good
[08:28:50] <kaaaz> >.<
[08:39:59] <walidvb> hi guys! i'm trying to accomplish the same effect that background-position: fixed has on images, but on a video/vimeo_iframe. Anyone knows a plugin, a way, or a hint?
[08:41:10] <FrankDWork> ack brainfart
[08:41:40] <FrankDWork> if im loading in new content via ajax whats the best way to get jquery to act on the new elements
[08:42:39] <FrankDWork> if i include the script in the ajax reply it registers clicks on the parent content for example a bunch of times
[08:43:28] <walidvb> my first guess is positionning absolutely the iframe, setting it fullscreen, detecting the scrolling position and setting a gap between the content that surroundsthe video
[08:43:33] <walidvb> is there no easier way?
[08:43:47] <walidvb> FrankDWork: try checking one() for single event registration
[08:44:43] <walidvb> FrankDWork: and the Drupal way of tdoing that, is to have your whole js wrapped in a var behavior = function(context){$('myElement', context)}, and then run behavior(ajaxLoadedContent)
[09:02:28] <nsanden> Anyone know of a wysiwyg that will let me search for a word and highlight all occurances of it
[09:03:03] <nsanden> or even better a jquery plugin that does the same for a textarea
[09:09:28] <Lope> how can I hide an element after a delay? I'm trying to get a click event on a li element. but the ul disappears when another element blurs. so I'd like to delay hiding the ul? My ul's have no ID's. is there some $(e).hideDelay() kind of function?
[09:12:18] <Lope> this doesn't work. $(e).delay(4000).css('display',(ev.type==='click') ? 'block' : 'none');
[09:12:26] <Lope> it goes instantly.
[09:14:46] <krastavac> shoky: http://codepad.org/SftX7OVi
[09:15:43] <Lope> is there a 'that' keyword in jquery?
[09:16:25] <BinaryKitten> Lope what would you expect "that" to be
[09:18:01] <fabioportieri> that = !this :>
[09:18:08] <duch_kazatel> wat
[09:18:37] <Lope> haha oh I was reading the code too hastily some people say var that=this; then branch
[09:27:34] <Guest61966> Can anyone recommend a straightforward slideshow animation tutorial or approach please? Fairly new to jquery. Thanks
[09:29:33] <Misan> Guest61966 do you know the basics of javascript?
[09:29:53] <Guest61966> Yep
[09:30:16] <Misan> what I love to do is to analyze existing scripts.. maybe you can take a look on nivo slider source code
[09:30:29] <Misan> or a more compact one
[09:32:19] <Guest61966> Sweet thanks im having a look now :)
[09:32:47] <Misan> thats all I can recommend.. .I took a look on clickingbad and cookieclicker before creating my own browser game :)
[09:32:58] <Misan> try not to copy but to combine the knowledge/wisdom
[09:41:14] <Guest61966> Before i get into the detail please could you explain generally what comprises a slideshow? Is it literally just changing Css properties on a stack of images?
[09:42:33] <jjenzz> weeb1e: still around? sorry, something came up here but back briefly and just had a look at your code
[09:43:58] <fabioportieri> Guest61966: pretty much, with a setInterval in there
[09:45:35] <jjenzz> weeb1e: your CoffeeScript output definitely hurts but is this what you were trying to achieve? http://jsfiddle.net/2Jmf8/5/
[09:58:32] <fabioportieri> i love doing extra work hours on 30 december!
[10:01:16] <jedimind> fabioportieri: everyone does!
[10:01:24] <jedimind> sadly im at home in my underwaer
[10:01:26] <jedimind> doing nothing
[10:01:30] <shoky> krastavac: your JSON is not valid
[10:01:46] <jedimind> ahaha krastavac
[10:02:36] <fabioportieri> that's sad jedimind... doing nothing but relax.. sad...
[10:02:46] <jedimind> its a rough life
[10:02:49] <jedimind> but someone has to do it
[10:02:57] <fabioportieri> yeah
[10:04:31] <weeb1e> jjenzz: Yeah that looks about right, I wonder if that would solve copying over data attributes which replaceWith breaks too
[10:04:36] <weeb1e> Thanks
[10:05:09] <jjenzz> weeb1e: yeah, passing true to $.clone() copies events and data
[10:05:37] <weeb1e> That's perfect, awesome solution
[10:07:29] <javalover> soo how does one deal with having 2 jquerys?
[10:07:39] <javalover> like i have 1.4 & 1.8 being loaded....
[10:07:42] <javalover> how do you manage this?
[10:07:51] <decap> I cant get the table to be in the center of the page in the jquery mobile . Im not sure why . everything comes to the center except the table
[10:07:52] <fabioportieri> javalover: jquery.noConflict
[10:08:17] <javalover> right but like how does this manage anything? what does that even mean?
[10:08:22] <javalover> just cuz you call that what does it do?
[10:08:45] <fabioportieri> it means you put a different aliases to your jquerys so you avoid conflicts
[10:08:52] <shoky> you shouldn't have 2 jquery loaded
[10:09:29] <weeb1e> Use 1.8 or later only, never multiple versions
[10:09:49] <jjenzz> weeb1e: no worries :)
[10:09:53] <decap> anyone ?
[10:10:25] <weeb1e> jjenzz: Now I just need to fix the remaining bugs with this code, and it should do the job
[10:10:45] <weeb1e> I still feel this is a heavy way of going about it, but I can't think of a better solution
[10:12:03] <jjenzz> It does look a little over complicated but I haven't had a chance to get my head around exactly what you're trying to do
[10:18:23] <weeb1e> jjenzz: Yeah :(
[10:18:47] <weeb1e> jjenzz: Well I've tracked down the only remaining immediately visible bug, but I'm not quite sure how to go about solving it
[10:18:56] <weeb1e> Perhaps you or someone else can help
[10:19:41] <weeb1e> Given the following input: <span style="color:#7F7F7F;">NICKNAME<span style="color:#CFD0CF;">&nbsp;foobar&nbsp;</span></span>
[10:20:12] <weeb1e> .children() will only return the nested span, and never the text "NICKNAME" which is not inside an element
[10:20:24] <weeb1e> Which means NICKNAME is not processed
[10:21:03] <weeb1e> Is there any way to select that text which is not inside a child element, and if not, how the hell do I go about this
[10:21:58] <shoky> weeb1e: .contents() gets all children including text nodes
[10:22:33] <weeb1e> shoky: Oh now that is awesome
[10:22:47] <weeb1e> I'm fairly sure I have asked this exact question in here a few months ago
[10:22:54] <weeb1e> And I was told it was impossible :P
[10:23:51] <shoky> maybe they meant impossible with .children()
[10:24:02] <BillCriswell> I have a webkit only project and I'm wondering... Would it make sense to use native drag and drop or use jquery ui?
[10:24:08] <weeb1e> shoky: What would be the best way to check if an element from .contents() is a DOM element?
[10:24:33] <shoky> weeb1e check its' nodeType property
[10:24:39] <weeb1e> BillCriswell: Webkit has native drag and drop? Didn't know that
[10:24:40] <duch_kazatel> aren't they all technically DOM elements...?
[10:24:56] <shoky> comments and text nodes aren't elements technically
[10:25:09] <duch_kazatel> sure, but they're in the DOM anyway.
[10:25:09] <weeb1e> Yeah they aren't elements, they're just blobs of text
[10:25:22] <weeb1e> Part of the DOM, just not an element
[10:25:24] <shoky> they're DOM nodes, not DOM elements ;p
[10:25:25] <jqueryDude> I'm getting quite odd behaviour on a single line in my jQuery codes, it says "SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list" on this line: $('.'chatID).css("color", color);
[10:25:52] <duch_kazatel> I hate that people use node/element interchangably.
[10:26:00] <duch_kazatel> until you ask about textNodes.
[10:26:19] <duch_kazatel>  $('.' + chatID).css("color", color);
[10:26:29] <jqueryDude> Omfg, I'm retarded
[10:26:30] <jqueryDude> thanks
[10:26:58] <weeb1e> Yeah, excuse me if my DOM vocab is slightly off, I am not really supposed to be a front end developer, even though I seem to be doing as much front end stuff as backend at the moment
[10:27:16] <nsanden> when i am focused inside a textarea/input and i click outside on an element where i have a click event handler, the event doesnt get fired unless i click it twice. any fix for this?
[10:27:42] <BillCriswell> Since I "know" jQuery I'm thinking I should just use jQuery UI for it...
[10:28:35] <Gretchymetchy> Hello, i'm wondering if anyone has an experience with customising the jquery download. When i customise for just getting the fixed navbar classes it does not work. It does only work if i use the whole jquery.mobile file.
[10:28:47] <weeb1e> BillCriswell: Sorry I meant to follow up with "I'd use jquery UI, no real reason not to"
[10:29:53] <BillCriswell> I feel like I could probably get better performance using native stuff.
[10:31:32] <duch_kazatel> nsanden have a fiddle to demonstrate?
[10:31:49] <nsanden> yeah ill make one real quick
[10:31:59] <Gretchymetchy> Whenever customising the download to just have the fixed toolbar it just stops being fixed
[10:32:36] <weeb1e> BillCriswell: Then your real question is, will the performance difference be noticeable
[10:37:19] <nsanden> duch_kazatel: the fiddle works fine, so i must be doing something wrong
[10:37:50] <Gretchymetchy> Anyone?
[10:39:27] <krastavac> var x = jsonobj.result.geo[0].cordinates[0];
[10:39:44] <krastavac> is this ok to access array member?
[10:40:30] <duch_kazatel> krastavac care to clarify?  dot notation (like you've got) is fine.
[10:41:52] <Gretchymetchy> Here is the JSfiddle of the custom jquery mobile file, where you clearly see that it does not function http://jsfiddle.net/NtKDk/
[10:48:13] <duch_kazatel> Gretchymetchy and you're including jQuery as well, right?
[10:48:59] <Gretchymetchy> Yes, i am including jquery 1.9.1 in the fiddle
[10:49:13] <krastavac> duch_kazatel: access coordinates[0] here http://codepad.org/HDjjQ5cg
[10:49:18] <krastavac> json object
[10:49:51] <Gretchymetchy> The fiddle is here:http://jsfiddle.net/NtKDk/ and the jquery code is here: http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder where the toolbars fixed and toolbars fixed: workaround is included
[10:49:57] <Gretchymetchy> thank you for your answer
[10:50:09] <duch_kazatel> Gretchymetchy I ask becuase I'm seeing a typeerror in the console
[10:50:14] <Gretchymetchy> The downloaded jquery code is downloaded and included in the code
[10:50:43] <duch_kazatel> krastavac that looks like coffeescript.
[10:50:51] <Gretchymetchy> I've just copied the whole content in the custom downloaded file from http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder
[10:51:28] <duch_kazatel> Gretchymetchy does it work if you use a full build of jqueryui?
[10:51:48] <krastavac> json printed from php
[10:52:17] <duch_kazatel> krastavac can you supply the output instead?
[10:52:54] <Gretchymetchy> dutch_kazatel Yes, if i use the whole jquery file and the whole jquerymobile file, but the problem is that i only want the navbar fixed code, as the rest of the code interfere with my other code
[10:53:12] <weeb1e> So shoky, now I have another issue
[10:53:22] <weeb1e> I cannot figure out how to replace a text node
[10:53:24] <duch_kazatel> Gretchymetchy which options are you selecting when you build out the ui code?
[10:53:41] <krastavac> from where?
[10:53:53] <duch_kazatel> krastavac wherever it gets output.
[10:54:46] <Gretchymetchy> Dutch_kazatel I include Toolbars: Fixed: Workarounds and Toolbars: Fixed: only.
[10:55:17] <weeb1e> Does anyone know how I can replace a text node with an element when using .contents().each(function() { $node = $(this) }); ?
[10:55:27] <weeb1e> I've tried using $node.html() but it does not work
[10:55:30] <duch_kazatel> Gretchymetchy fyi there's no "t" in my username ;)
[10:55:50] <krastavac> you cant print json object with js
[10:55:55] <BillCriswell> I was wrong. Duh.
[10:55:58] <duch_kazatel> Gretchymetchy either way, strange.  i don't use jqueryui much personally, so I'm not terribly sure what the issue is.
[10:56:39] <duch_kazatel> krastavac huh?  how is that getting output?  api call?  I need to see the actual data since I don't know PHP all that well.
[10:56:59] <Gretchymetchy> Dutch_kazatel yes, thank you for you'r help - very strange. Probably a fault with the build? Would be a nightmare to try to build it myself though
[10:57:44] <duch_kazatel> Gretchymetchy no, probably not.  you're likely doing something incorrect.  and again, there's no t in my username ;)
[10:58:35] <krastavac> hahaha
[10:59:45] <weeb1e> shoky: Perhaps what I asked was how to manipulate text nodes, and that does not appear to be possible
[11:00:20] <duch_kazatel> weeb1e uh, wat.  you can edit textnodes.
[11:00:30] <weeb1e> duch_kazatel: How?
[11:00:36] <duch_kazatel> if you're using jquery, .text()
[11:00:43] <duch_kazatel> as long as you're on the correct textnode.
[11:00:51] <weeb1e> duch_kazatel: $el = $('<div>Hello<span>World</span></div>'); How do I edit $el.contents()[0] ?
[11:01:43] <weeb1e> I actually need to replace it with a html element node, not just edit the text
[11:01:58] <weeb1e> But editing it would be a step in the right direction, since so far I can't do anything to it
[11:02:16] <shoky> weeb1e: with .text()
[11:02:32] <Gretchymetchy> Ah of course so sorry duch_kazatel! Hm, i only select those parts, download the file, copy it directly into jsfiddle, copy the exact right html code (that works great) and the excact right css code. It works if i select the whole jquery mobile alternative
[11:02:49] <weeb1e> shoky: That doesn't work
[11:02:53] <weeb1e> $($el.contents()[0]).text('test')
[11:02:53] <weeb1e> ["Hello"]
[11:03:12] <shoky> oh right
[11:03:23] <weeb1e> But since I need to replace it with an HTML element, that wouldn't really help either
[11:03:33] <weeb1e> How can I replace the text node with another element?
[11:03:44] <weeb1e> Without rebuilding the entire parent element from scratch
[11:04:32] <duch_kazatel> Gretchymetchy pasting a whole lib into jsfiddle isn't going to work the way you want it to, btw.  are you getting these problems on an actual live page somewhere?
[11:04:58] <weeb1e> I'll be back in a few, If anyone knows of a solution, please let me know.
[11:05:38] <Gretchymetchy> Yes, i do as well, on a local page. When i use the built jquery mobile code, then i get no fixed footer - when i use the whole jquery mobile code it is working, duch_kazatel
[11:05:59] <duch_kazatel> Gretchymetchy then you're likely doing something incorrectly.  not sure what to tell you at this point.
[11:10:08] <Gretchymetchy> Thank you for your help though, duch_kazatel , i'm gonna try fundling around - but can't really see what i'm doing wrong
[11:11:39] <Gretchymetchy> duch_kazatel : Update! Tried to include a bunch of other things, then it works. Looks like there are some requirements not stated
[11:12:06] <datarecal> I am trying to figure out the child div id of another div that we appended to PathSetup would this be the way to do it : console.log($('#PathSetup:last-child').attr('id'));
[11:14:47] <krastavac> i could use help http://jsfiddle.net/kN7yZ/49/  to print just any property of geo
[11:23:55] <Velveeta> krastavac: your top level is an array, you can't reference it with dot notation like that, you need to specify index 0 first, then dereference the object path within it
[11:27:43] <duch_kazatel> krastavac http://jsfiddle.net/kN7yZ/51/
[11:34:02] <tpayne> Hello. Does anyone know of any existing jquery add ons one open source projects that do something like this? http://imgur.com/memegen/create/LaENqOV
[11:34:05] <javalover> so i'm using no conflict mode
[11:34:13] <javalover> is there any way to fix the $?
[11:34:21] <javalover> or do I have to use the variable I set?
[11:34:48] <Velveeta> you can wrap your code in a closure that passes in that variable and receives it as a local variable of $
[11:35:10] <Velveeta> like this: (function ($) { // your code here }(yourJqueryVariable));
[11:36:36] <javalover> soooo
[11:36:57] <javalover> function loadstuff($){}    okloadstuff(myvar);  ?
[11:37:06] <javalover> eww bad psuedo lol
[11:37:27] <duch_kazatel> (function ($) { // use yourJqueryVariable here instead of $ }(yourJqueryVariable));
[11:37:53] <javalover> am I overwriting something?
[11:38:06] <duch_kazatel> learn about closures :)
[11:38:08] <Velveeta> no, not that, the whole point of passing in $ is to use it in the local scope
[11:38:10] <duch_kazatel> but not globally, no.
[11:38:32] <Velveeta> like if you had code that called $.ajax, but was calling with a version of jquery < 1.5 so it didn't use promises
[11:38:57] <Velveeta> you could do this instead: (function ($) { $.ajax(options); }(jQuery19variable));
[11:39:06] <javalover> right that's what I was thinking....
[11:39:25] <Velveeta> so you're explicitly passing in your newer jquery variable to that function that you immediately invoke, and receiving it as a local $ variable that you can use for shorthand
[11:39:26] <javalover> wait why the () on the outside of that?
[11:39:52] <javalover> oh to make it invoke
[11:39:58] <Velveeta> because you're invoking that function and passing that variable to it
[11:40:23] <javalover> hmm this is gonna be a rollercoaster
[11:40:40] <Velveeta> not really, it probably just looks that way, it's pretty simple in reality
[11:40:45] <Jon47> welcome to closures
[11:42:08] <javalover> okay so one last ask I know it's werid to ask but
[11:42:33] <javalover> function changephoto2(){$("#myphoto").show();}
[11:42:36] <javalover> say I have like that...
[11:43:22] <javalover> can I do it like this?   function changephoto2($){ $("#myphoto").show();}  ?? with the extra $?
[11:44:28] <javalover> or would I go...
[11:44:33] <Velveeta> sure, if you call it like this: changephoto2(jqueryVariable);
[11:44:38] <javalover> (function($){changephoto2();}
[11:45:06] <javalover> i'm just trying to match it to your example
[11:45:27] <javalover> I think I get it now looking over it
[11:45:30] <javalover> it's the opposite of what I wrote
[11:45:58] <javalover> so instead of going $.ajax(options);  you'r going (function($){ $.ajax(options);}(urvar)
[11:46:35] <javalover> so instead of changephoto2();  I would go (function($){ changephoto2()}(urvar));
[11:46:36] <javalover> right?
[11:46:38] <javalover> or wrong?
[11:47:08] <Velveeta> wrong, you would put the changephoto2 function declaration itself inside of that closure
[11:47:18] <javalover> ohhhh
[11:47:26] <javalover> sooo
[11:48:22] <javalover> (function($){changephoto2(varstuff){ $hasnowchanged}}(jQuery19variable));
[11:48:41] <javalover> aight 1 sec i try this
[11:58:15] <javalover> hmm I did that & lost functions
[11:58:37] <javalover> i just need to overhall all of this
[11:58:39] <javalover> and make it organized
[12:01:25] <Velveeta> well  yeah, any function you put inside that closure is gonna be scoped to that closure, so any function calling it needs to live inside of that also, or else you need to expose it publicly
[12:04:04] <javalover> is there a way to make public?
[12:04:05] <javalover> static?
[12:04:21] <javalover> unless well
[12:04:24] <javalover> hmm
[12:06:15] <javalover> oddly enough I found this
[12:06:22] <javalover> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3537501/jquery-how-to-make-function-in-an-object-public
[12:06:49] <javalover> so basically all plugins do this
[12:09:29] <micz123> hi all ^_^, me again
[12:14:08] <sekyms_> ping
[12:16:51] <BillCriswell> pang
[12:23:07] <Absolute0> If I added a custom function to jquery how do I handle arrays? Do I have manually traverse the array in my function or is there some helper I can use?
[12:23:35] <Velveeta> you would manually traverse the array, or use something like .each()
[12:23:41] <sekyms_> .each
[12:23:57] <sekyms_> Thank you BillCriswell I was beginning to wonder
[12:23:58] <Absolute0> Can I assume that an array is always set to this?
[12:24:21] <Velveeta> it depends on what namespace you're storing your custom function under
[12:24:25] <Velveeta> $ or $.fn
[12:24:28] <Eviltwin> If you've added your function to $.fn, you can assume that "this" is a jQuery objet
[12:24:31] <Absolute0> $.fn
[12:24:31] <Eviltwin> object*
[12:25:00] <Eviltwin> So you can use any of the functions you can use on a jQuery object. In this case, you probably want most of your function body inside of a this.each
[12:25:14] <Absolute0> otcha
[12:25:15] <Absolute0> gotcha
[12:25:34] <Absolute0> Do you guys prefix your jquery objects with a $?
[12:25:56] <Absolute0> ie var $div = $('div'); ?
[12:25:56] <Eviltwin> Usually not, with the exception of doing var $this = $(this);
[12:26:25] <Absolute0> https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#jquery
[12:27:07] <sekyms_> I do if they are a dom element
[12:27:09] <Eviltwin> Well if Airbnb says it...
[12:27:13] <sekyms_> I do this.$selector
[12:27:37] <Velveeta> i do it for $this, but not really for any other var names
[12:27:53] <Absolute0> I don't like they way it looks on anything other that $this.
[12:28:08] <sekyms_> I just find it helpful to remember which vars are essentially selectors and which aren't.
[12:28:31] <sekyms_> but I cache all of them i a cacheElements function
[12:28:36] <BillCriswell> $dollaDollaBillYall
[12:28:50] <Velveeta> $dollaDollaBillCriswellYall
[12:29:29] <BillCriswell> I'm playing with drag and drop essentially for my first time... really making more sense than I thought it would.
[12:33:08] <sekyms_> Absolute0 ajpiano does the $firends = $(".friend") thing so I started doing it, not a bad person to copy
[12:33:11] * sekyms_ shrugs
[12:34:21] <Absolute0> Are you shrugging at yourself?
[12:35:02] <sekyms_> Shoulder exercises
[12:35:05] <sekyms_> Im going to be huge
[12:35:11] <Absolute0> Booyah!
[12:35:28] <Absolute0> Don't forget the creatine.
[12:35:35] <duch_kazatel> we push people to cache selectors and prepend them with dollar signs so it's a little easier to see what's going on.
[12:36:01] <Absolute0> Does jquery cache selectors internally?
[12:36:05] <sekyms_> it's faster if you cache them as well correct?
[12:36:26] <duch_kazatel> jquery does not cache them, no.
[12:36:30] <Absolute0> $('.foo'); $('.foo'); //<-- is the second one retreived from cache?
[12:36:37] <Absolute0> duch_kazatel: why not?
[12:36:58] <sekyms_> seems like a waste
[12:36:59] <duch_kazatel> because the document can update/change.  jquery tries its best to be friendly with things like that.
[12:37:02] <sekyms_> if you only need it once
[12:37:10] <BillCriswell> Absolute0: I doubt it.
[12:37:27] <Absolute0> it would be nice to have cache feature
[12:37:30] <Velveeta> yeah, if jquery cached selectors, you could get back invalid state if your document were dynamic
[12:37:38] <Absolute0> $('.fooBar', useCache);
[12:37:40] <Velveeta> if you want a cache feature, it takes 2 seconds to write it
[12:37:48] <Velveeta> var cached = $('.fooBar')
[12:37:49] <Velveeta> done
[12:37:51] <duch_kazatel> probably the same reason behind not throwing an error when you try to run methods against a selector that matches nothing.
[12:37:55] <BillCriswell> var $foos = $('.foo'); haha
[12:38:18] <Absolute0> Velveeta: i know that it's easy. Was just curious.
[12:38:39] <Velveeta> i think a feature like that would hurt more things than it helped
[12:38:57] <Velveeta> because people would come to rely on it, and then wonder why their new dynamic content wasn't being returned when they queried for it
[12:39:02] <Velveeta> and then blame it on jquery
[12:39:08] <BillCriswell> What confused me is: var $foos = $('.foo'); $foos.last().remove(); and after this $foos.length is still the same as when it was created.
[12:39:09] <duch_kazatel> eeexactly.
[12:39:30] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta it's like the problems people have understanding event bindings.
[12:39:47] <Velveeta> right
[12:40:09] <duch_kazatel> event binding is easy, but caching selectors would add in a new level of confusion for newbies.
[12:40:30] <Velveeta> i guess he didn't like what we thought of his idea
[12:40:56] <BillCriswell> All your ideas are stupid.
[12:41:02] <duch_kazatel> hahaha.  i remember thinking the same thing long ago, but i discovered why it was a bad idea.
[12:41:47] <Velveeta> the stupidest of my stupid ideas are smarter than the stupidest smart …. smartest….. stupid…………… you're stupid
[12:41:55] <duch_kazatel> gosh shut up even
[12:42:34] <BillCriswell> Stupid ideas teach you a valuable lesson, what not to do.
[12:42:52] <BillCriswell> Which, somehow to me, is more useful than knowing exactly what to do.
[12:43:20] <Velveeta> i've learned so many ways to fail at doing things
[12:43:57] <BillCriswell> I tried to write my own markdown converter like 3 weeks into learning PHP. That was fucking hilarious.
[12:44:04] <Velveeta> lol
[12:44:06] <duch_kazatel> ugh
[12:44:10] <duch_kazatel> that sounds gross.
[12:44:22] <BillCriswell> It wasn't good.
[12:44:24] <Velveeta> i tried writing an natural language processor for unit tests once :D
[12:44:38] <BillCriswell> I don't even know what most of those words mean.
[12:44:40] <duch_kazatel> nooooooo.
[12:44:44] <BillCriswell> Well, not combined how they are.
[12:44:57] <duch_kazatel> probably something like "go to x page and click the link that says 'lolol'"
[12:45:15] <Velveeta> it means i wanted to be able to write unit tests like "when you click on the third tab in the #navigation element, the page should change its location to http://blahblahblah.com"
[12:45:22] <Velveeta> yeah pretty much :D
[12:45:28] <duch_kazatel> oh god no stop
[12:45:30] <Velveeta> it was a pet project that was thrown to me by our cto
[12:45:44] <Velveeta> though i never got the full details out of it because he's so socratic in his method
[12:46:08] <Velveeta> he doesn't like answer direct questions, he just says stuff like: "so what exactly do you want this to do?" "well, le tme ask you this, what is it that you think i want it to do?"
[12:46:21] <duch_kazatel> oh.  no.
[12:46:25] <duch_kazatel> pls.  god stop.
[12:46:43] <sekyms_> Velveeta: you know this channel is logged right?
[12:46:48] <Velveeta> "so you want people to be able to write unit tests in more of a meta language?" "well, how do you think writing tests like that might force you to reevaluate the way you write code?"
[12:46:52] * Velveeta screams inwardly.
[12:47:07] <Velveeta> sekyms_: yes, i know, though i haven't been able to find the logs anytime recently
[12:47:16] <grafi> http://cserotica.tumblr.com/
[12:47:19] <Velveeta> the old link to them just bounces to jquery forms now
[12:47:25] <grafi> Have fun my little popsicles
[12:47:25] <sekyms_> oh goo
[12:47:25] <grafi> :P
[12:47:37] <duch_kazatel> i've worked with people like that.  it's invariable that they'll eventually say "go ahead and spec out a feed to supply us with data".  when you send them a sample, they'll tell you it's wrong.
[12:47:40] <sekyms_> I had said a lot of stupid things before I knew it was logged
[12:47:41] <BillCriswell> http://irc.jquery.org/%23jquery/
[12:48:04] <sekyms_> curses
[12:48:18] <Velveeta> there we go
[12:48:20] <duch_kazatel> why does it matter if it's logged?
[12:48:30] <grafi> Velveeta isnt that like gerkin or whatever its called works? roughly ^^
[12:48:52] <Velveeta> so yeah, i knew it was logged, but i'm not using any names, and i highly doubt he visits that history anyway.. he's a fan of throwing more back end engineers at a problem, and letting them write js as they need
[12:48:55] <BillCriswell> Intelligent people wouldn't use their real name so the logs wouldn't matter.
[12:49:02] <Velveeta> but then we wind up with 20000 lines of spaghetti code that's impossible to maintain
[12:49:17] <grafi> ha
[12:49:18] <grafi> <:
[12:49:19] <sekyms_> BillCriswell: I have never claimed to be intelligent
[12:49:44] <duch_kazatel> and with that, I go to lunch.  bbiab
[12:49:48] <BillCriswell> BillCriswell is an alias
[12:49:51] <Velveeta> grafi: i've seen a couple of more natural language types of unit test frameworks
[12:49:54] <BillCriswell> for WilliamCriswell
[12:50:06] <Velveeta> but the other requirement he had was that as things move around on screen, it shouldn't necessitate a rewrite of the tests
[12:50:28] <Velveeta> which would mean that pretty much everything would have to be written using id's, or else the language would have to be able to just magically find whatever you're talking about testing
[12:50:55] <Velveeta> oh yeah, and also, these should be embeddable as a link in tickets, as sort of an automated walkthrough demo of how a feature should work
[12:51:09] <Velveeta> except that afterwards, when i repeated all these words back, i got "no, that's not what i'm saying"
[12:51:20] <Velveeta> so eventually i just threw up my hands and shelved it completely
[12:51:23] <sekyms_> I am having some serious issues using Leaflet to do somethings Leaflet was never meant to be use for
[12:51:59] <BillCriswell> sekyms_: Who would have saw that coming?
[12:52:02] <sekyms_> Velveeta: Bosses always love the way unit tests sound until they find out it takes longer to code the same thing
[12:52:14] <sekyms_> BillCriswell: I know right?
[12:52:19] <BillCriswell> :-D
[12:52:47] <Velveeta> i have no problem writing unit tests, and they definitely save time in the long run by alerting you to some change spiderwebbing out into other functionality
[12:52:52] <BillCriswell> I spend way too much time finding the perfect tool for a job. I kind of think I'd be better off just hacking at something I know would get me like 70% there.
[12:52:57] <sekyms_> and now I have this huge amount of code that I need to dissect in order to figureo ut what's going wrong because i saved this feature until last
[12:53:11] <Velveeta> but you have to also understand that as code and layouts change, unit tests have to change with them to reflect the current state of how things are supposed to work
[12:53:21] <Velveeta> that's just part of the technical debt that has to be paid during development time
[12:53:41] <sekyms_> Not all bosses understand that
[12:55:34] <sekyms_> Parents just don't understand

[13:00:58] <tieTYT2> but the weird thing is, on firefox, if I trigger this on one dialog, it also seems to click on the next dialog
[13:01:00] * sekyms_ tiptoes out of the room
[13:01:07] <tieTYT2> this does not happen in chrome
[13:01:24] <tieTYT2> and the firefox debugger shows that the second dialog trigger is coming directly from jquery
[13:01:25] <lianzinho> guys, anyone could help me debug infinite scroll plugin ?
[13:02:01] <lianzinho> i'm using the wordpress version but people in #wordpress does not have any clue… I think it's more a JS issue than wordpress
[13:02:22] <javalover> well since this is gonna take forever
[13:02:29] <javalover> I simply bandaided the situation & replaced the $ with jQuery
[13:02:31] <tieTYT2> sekyms_: that code is pretty simple.  Think of it like this: $(dialogId + " [data-x='xValue'][data-y='yValue']").click()
[13:03:01] <sekyms_> javalover: been a while but I think you have to do that in wordpress to get jquery to work
[13:04:55] <lianzinho> anyone?
[13:06:49] <javalover> yeah not using wordpress, just being lazy
[13:09:14] <sekyms_> lianzinho: sometimes it helps if you ask your question
[13:10:18] <lianzinho> sekyms_: the plugin just don't work, do not load my next posts… the selectors seems right
[13:10:34] <sekyms_> is jquery loading?
[13:11:10] <datarecal> cur_lander[path] = cur_lander[path] + 1; is there any reason that would be incrementing the path variable ?
[13:11:40] <lianzinho> yes… the plugin is working, it even gets the determinePath object
[13:11:54] <lianzinho> parses the link URL
[13:12:00] <lianzinho> get the number of pages
[13:12:03] <lianzinho> but do not load
[13:12:04] <sekyms_> Im not familiar with the plug-in lianzinho so I can only guess the very simple causes
[13:12:24] <sekyms_> are you getting a success from the ajax call?
[13:13:19] <lianzinho> sekyms_: cannot say, the ajax call is buried inside the code, cannot see if succeeds or not, any clue?
[13:14:34] <BillCriswell> Check out the Network tab thang.
[13:14:47] <BillCriswell> William Hung Dance Party at work.
[13:15:19] <sekyms_> BillCriswell: speaks the truth
[13:15:26] <sekyms_> BillCriswell: what part of the country are you in?
[13:15:50] <BillCriswell> Philadelphia
[13:15:53] <Absolute0> Can I get the before and after values of a select.change() event?
[13:16:00] <sekyms_> Ah the city of angry football fans...
[13:16:09] <lianzinho> BillCriswell: it does not seems to be doing any ajax call… I guess it should trigger it upon scrolling… but the network panel is still
[13:16:28] <BillCriswell> sekyms_: Yes... We're relatively happy right now, though.
[13:16:31] <sekyms_> Absolute0 I usually will store the before value in a namespace var and then on change change the new one to the before
[13:16:48] <Absolute0> sekyms_: http://stackoverflow.com/a/4076949/172776 thanks
[13:16:53] <sekyms_> there is no method that I am aware of
[13:17:24] <sekyms_> Absolute0: just be careful with focus and blur functionality across browsers
[13:17:35] <Absolute0> ie8?
[13:17:50] <sekyms_> only one way to find out
[13:17:57] <Absolute0> tias?
[13:18:11] <Absolute0> or fire your ie clients?
[13:19:21] <lianzinho> well, forget about it, I guess I'll have to write this myself… thanks
[13:19:59] <javalover> ummmmmmmmmmm
[13:20:06] <javalover> oh wait no i got it
[13:23:01] <Axel_> Hi people. I have an array of elements (no selector provided). I have to check if one of the elements doesn't contain any other elements of that array. Any ideas ?
[13:23:30] <Absolute0> Axel_: checkout underscore.js
[13:23:37] <lianzinho> you have an array of arrays ?
[13:23:42] <Axel_> No, I don't want to use any libraries
[13:23:49] <Absolute0> No!
[13:24:26] <Axel_> lianzinho, No, an array of jQuery elements
[13:24:44] <Axel_> (I'm pretty sure that's an array of objects)
[13:27:05] <sekyms_> and you are trying to find out if none of them have same value?
[13:27:06] <jphase> yup
[13:27:12] <sekyms_> for every key value of the object?
[13:27:22] <BillCriswell> Wikipedia says Hung is dead. Not cool.
[13:28:24] <sekyms_> Axel_: what are you trying to match?
[13:32:07] <shoky> Axel_: var elemsNotContainingOthers = $.grep(arr, function(elem) { var contained = $.grep(arr, function(elem2) { return elem !== elem2 && $.contains(elem, elem2); }); return contained.length === 0; });
[13:32:30] <Axel_> I don't think you can do that with jQuery
[13:32:42] <shoky> i'm sure there are more efficient ways, and shorter ways
[13:33:02] <Axel_> and why not prototype instead of taking 2 parameters :P
[13:33:26] <sekyms_> wait didnt you ask for help :p
[13:33:31] <shoky> huh.
[13:33:41] <Axel_> yes and I'm not sure anymore what I have to ask
[13:33:47] <shoky> IE8 doesn't have prototype .filter
[13:33:49] <shoky> that's why
[13:33:49] <Axel_> that would have been my solution as well
[13:34:07] <sekyms_> Is this one of those shows where you know everything and you come in and make us look like jerks :D
[13:34:44] <Axel_> Yes! You're on TV ! Candid camera on your right
[13:35:14] <sekyms_> I KNEW IT
[13:35:54] <Axel_> Mhm. I'm now using $.mousedown().mouseup(), can it be done more efficiently taking 2 functions ?
[13:35:57] <sekyms_> jokes on you this is actually an intervention for you Axel_
[13:36:55] <Axel_> like $.hover does
[13:37:14] <shoky> no, and it isn't more efficient in any case
[13:38:23] <Axel_> no but easier to read
[13:38:29] <Axel_> I don't like long chains
[13:38:37] <sekyms_> I dont like snakes
[13:38:42] <shoky> no one's forcing you to chain
[13:38:49] <sekyms_> which are much like long chains can we be friends?
[13:38:53] <shoky> el.mousedown(..);  el.mouseup(..);
[13:39:10] <Axel_> err yea :p
[13:44:41] <tieTYT2> i've got this issue where on firefox, one keypress seems to fire multiple events.  This doesn't occur on chrome.  How can I debug the cause of this issue?
[13:45:04] <tieTYT2> if I put a breakpoint on the second firing, it seems to come directly from jquery itself from the call stack
[13:46:10] <shoky> the whole call stack is just jquery's code?
[13:46:21] <tieTYT2> no just the start of it.  It's very short
[13:46:27] <shoky> the start doesn't matter
[13:46:39] <shoky> the one or two entries that are your own code, in the middle, matter
[13:46:46] <javalover> well shoky I got some good news & some bad news
[13:47:06] <tieTYT2> ok well I've got my own at the end, not the middle.  But how do I figure out why it's being called?
[13:47:11] <shoky> i was doin alright with no news
[13:47:14] <javalover> the good news is, I just saved money on my code insurance by switching to jQuery
[13:47:25] <shoky> wat
[13:47:33] <javalover> the bad news is, I still have disorganized puke for code
[13:47:52] <shoky> my condolences for your puke
[13:48:37] <shoky> tieTYT2 make a jsfiddle or link to a demo
[13:48:48] <tieTYT2> ok, a demo would be pretty easy
[13:54:18] <tieTYT2> ok so go to chainofheroes.com  When it's loaded press "space" (don't click).  You'll see that in chrome, it goes to the tutorial after that.  But in firefox, it skips past the tutorial and goes directly to the game
[13:54:53] <tieTYT2> I was hoping there'd be an easier way to debug this.  Like a breakpoint in jquery code or inspecting the event element could tell me why the second handler is being called
[13:56:10] <BillCriswell> Anyone know if there's support for touch events coming in jQuery UI?
[13:57:57] <andrew_r> tieTYT2: is vendor.js your code?
[13:58:02] <jost> BillCriswell: you could just use jQuery mobile
[13:58:10] <tieTYT2> no, that contains jquery in it
[13:58:24] <tieTYT2> vendor is NOT my code.  It also has lodash in it
[13:58:32] <shoky> tieTYT2 it would certainly be easier to debug if the code wasn't minified
[13:58:42] <andrew_r> jquery, plus a bunch of other stuff in it.
[13:58:49] <jost> in the download builder, just activate only the "touch events" button, so you won't get any extra markup
[13:58:58] <jost> BillCriswell:
[13:59:05] <andrew_r> if you search keypress in vendor.js, it's doing some funky stuff
[13:59:20] <Forest_> hello. i have a problem and i can´t figure it out how to solve it,anyone to assist me please? :)
[13:59:26] <tieTYT2> ok let me check that out
[13:59:46] <BillCriswell> jost: I feel like maybe you meant to paste something.
[14:00:40] <jost> BillCriswell: actually, no... but look here: http://jquerymobile.com/download-builder/
[14:00:49] <tieTYT2> all that "funky stuff" seems to be coming from jquery-ui
[14:01:07] <shoky> nothing funky about it
[14:01:45] <Axel_> nice, I'd like that builder for jQuery as well
[14:01:48] <tieTYT2> i want to see if listening to keydown events fixes all my issues.  The keypress documentation mentions that different browsers handle it differently
[14:01:48] <Forest_> i have implemented a function like this to enable hover functino on shopping cart in menu,but whenever user is redirected elsewhere,e.g. from idnex.php to /register route,document.ready doesnt work,anyone to help me out?  http://pastebin.com/WqD7jwuY
[14:01:58] <andrew_r> I see - that "suppressKeyPress" and "suppressKeyPressRepeat" looked weird to me at first
[14:02:50] <tieTYT2> this jquery-ui is version v1.10.3.  But I'm using jquery 2.0.3.  Will that cause problems?
[14:03:33] <tieTYT2> damn it, I am listening to keydown.  My mistake
[14:03:45] <tieTYT2> sorry about that
[14:04:03] <Forest_> please help me,i have been looking for solution for hours......
[14:05:07] <BillCriswell> jost: I shall look into this.
[14:05:32] <shoky> tieTYT2 i see you're triggering a click in response to the keydown...
[14:05:51] <shoky> maybe it's the click that's getting triggered by ff
[14:05:53] <jost> BillCriswell: ok... its important not to choose to many modules, as some automatically add markup
[14:06:04] <tieTYT2> yeah, the reason I'm doing that is I already have a ton of logic I want to reuse that I already wrote that already reacts to click
[14:06:21] <BillCriswell> jost: Right right.
[14:06:50] <shoky> tieTYT2: triggering clicks is evil if the intention is just to run a function.
[14:07:04] <tieTYT2> ok, I'll see if I can think of a way to avoid it then
[14:07:14] <shoky> either trigger a custom event or just call the function
[14:08:52] <Forest_> guys,nobody ever had that problem?
[14:09:00] <andrew_r> Forest_: what do you mean "document.ready doesn't work"? If you go to yoursite.com/register, then the volanie() function is not called?
[14:09:19] <tieTYT2> thanks for the help, I'll see if this fixes it
[14:09:22] <Forest_> andrew_r: indeed,it is not called,only resize works
[14:09:53] <Forest_> adnrew_r: document.ready is not called even if i refresh the register page,it is called only on index.php
[14:10:18] <Velveeta> this is probably a stupid question, but, do you have the document.ready code in the register page?
[14:11:07] <Forest_> Velveeta: yes,it is inherited from base template :)
[14:11:22] <Velveeta> is that up on a live url someplace we can see it in action?
[14:11:37] <andrew_r> you aren't adding your .kosik_nav elements dynamically are you?
[14:12:03] <Velveeta> yeah, how about you drop an alert() statement into that document.ready function
[14:12:08] <Velveeta> see if it gets alerted on page change
[14:12:15] <Velveeta> something that's not doing a dom operation
[14:12:36] <Forest_> andrew_r:  i am just removing and adding class 'neviditelny element'
[14:13:24] <Forest_> Velveeta: alert only pops out on index.php
[14:13:36] <Velveeta> is there a live url we can see it happening?
[14:13:45] <Forest_> document.ready is completely ignored on register page
[14:13:47] <Velveeta> also, this isn't a single page application is it?
[14:13:56] <Forest_> Velveeta: it is not
[14:14:00] <Velveeta> you're not ajax-loading these other pages right?
[14:14:23] <Forest_> Velveeta: no,i am using szmfonz framework
[14:14:48] <Velveeta> i'm gonna assume that's symfony
[14:15:09] <Forest_> Velveeta: sorry, i had switched keyboard
[14:15:13] <Velveeta> well, without being able to see a working demo of what's going on, there's not really gonna be any way we can help with this
[14:15:34] <Velveeta> i've thrown out all of the easy questions i thought might be the issue, but at this point, i'd have to see it in action
[14:15:45] <Forest_> Velveeta: will it be enough to see live demo without that register page?
[14:16:06] <Velveeta> maybe, but probably not, since that seems to be where the problem is
[14:16:48] <Forest_> Velveeta: okay, i try to reupload it on rhcloud again,but it takes long,because all vendors have to be downloaded from remote host
[14:17:10] <Velveeta> are the vendors necessary for the page to load just to display this problem?
[14:17:47] <Forest_> Velveeta: unfortunately they are and i wasnt able to get it working other way than waiting 20 minutes to get the job done
[14:18:34] <maxmoore14> anyone use jquery mobile with windows xp / ie8 ?
[14:18:41] <datarecal> i have x amount inputs with the same class name what is the best way to take x / 100 then put that number across all the inputs with that class
[14:19:25] <maxmoore14> my form inputs are not themed correctly - specifically, they have no border - making them virtually invisible
[14:20:14] <datarecal> can you use length to count the number of inputs with that class ?
[14:20:16] <Velveeta> datarecal: var someClass = $('.someClass'), value = someClass.length / 100; someClass.val(value); ? if i'm understanding the question right?
[14:20:19] <nicholasschulz> if i want to add a .php file to a div, how do i go about it? i remember using ajax back in the day, but if believe that was for a different purpose.. ? can't remember..
[14:20:43] <nicholasschulz> add the content of a .php file that is*
[14:20:51] <jphase> nicholasschulz: you can use .load
[14:20:55] <Velveeta> `api load @nicholasschulz
[14:20:55] <b-ot> nicholasschulz: .load(): Load data from the server and place the returned HTML into the matched element. http://api.jquery.com/load/
[14:21:02] <Velveeta> damnit jphase :D
[14:21:02] <nicholasschulz> agh, thanks :-)
[14:21:04] <BillCriswell> nicholasschulz: $('.foo').load('file.php'); should work.
[14:21:05] <jphase> :P
[14:21:12] <nicholasschulz> perfect ;-)
[14:21:19] <jphase> yours was more professional and all linky though
[14:21:28] <Velveeta> i try to be all fancypants when i can
[14:22:20] <datarecal> thanks Velveeta length worked nicely
[14:22:24] <BillCriswell> I hate when a have a dev tools window open and I'm waiting for the log to show me something and it's for a different page lol
[14:22:25] <andrew_r> Forest_: did you confirm when you look at the html source for your register page that the $(document).ready() stuff is in there?
[14:22:49] <Forest_> andrew_r: yes and it is present
[14:24:13] <andrew_r> if that code is after your HTML that you are manipulating (IE: at the bottom of the page) have you just tried calling volanie(); outside of the document.ready?
[14:25:30] <Forest_> andrew_r: all scripts are in the header
[14:27:23] <Forest_> Valeeta: i am uploading right now,i will let zou know when its up
[14:27:39] <Forest_> Velveeta: i am uploading right now,i will let zou know when its up
[14:29:02] <Forest_> andrew_r: the problem is that maybe that page is already loaded or i dont know
[14:30:05] <nicholasschulz> $('#loggedIn_content').load("pageSelect.php?id="+menuBar_page_id);         shouldn't this work? i want to load "pageSelect.php?id=[someInteger]"
[14:31:14] <duch_kazatel> nicholasschulz should.  are you getting any errors in the console?
[14:31:51] <nicholasschulz> nope, but it doesn't load with the integer.. and when i alert the var the correct integer shows… weird
[14:32:23] <andrew_r> nicholasschulz: check your "net/network" tab to see what the ajax call looks like and that it doesn't return a 404 or 500 or something
[14:32:46] <duch_kazatel> what about to suggest what andrew_r reccommends.  this is why i hate .load();
[14:32:58] <Velveeta> i use $.ajax for everything
[14:33:04] <duch_kazatel> good.
[14:33:10] <duch_kazatel> if you don't you're asking for pain.
[14:33:14] * Velveeta nods once at himself.
[14:33:31] * Velveeta grabs the pain box and opens the front hatch on it.
[14:33:32] <andrew_r> you guys suggested he used .load() :p
[14:33:35] <Velveeta> put your hand inside the box.
[14:33:38] <duch_kazatel> who did?
[14:33:52] <Velveeta> i suggested that load() was the function he asked about
[14:33:56] <andrew_r> I dunno, like 3 people did
[14:33:57] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah
[14:34:04] <Velveeta> because for novice developers, it wraps most of the functionality he's looking for
[14:34:27] <Velveeta> i myself use $.ajax for everything, but i didn't want to explain that he would have to make his call, then add a success callback and grab a handle to his node and inject the content manually
[14:34:33] <Velveeta> when i could just say "load"
[14:34:38] <duch_kazatel> sensible.
[14:34:46] <duch_kazatel> i always like pointing people to the docs, but I'm kind of a dick soooo...
[14:34:56] <Velveeta> i pointed him to the docs for load :D
[14:35:11] <nicholasschulz> duch_kazatel: i'm gonna change to ajax as well.. done it before, so it shouldn't take THAT long to learn it all over again :-)
[14:35:12] <duch_kazatel> >.>
[14:35:37] <duch_kazatel> $.ajax is good stuff either way, partially for the same reason i prefer .on(); for binding.
[14:35:42] <tieTYT2> shoky: I think I figured it out.  You may have said this earlier.  I think on FF that space fires the focused input.  So when I press space, it's triggering things twice
[14:35:58] <tieTYT2> i notice if I hit enter instead of space, events fire the way I want.
[14:36:20] <nicholasschulz> i want a 'loading' GIF too, so ajax is probably better anyway..
[14:36:43] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah.
[14:36:48] <duch_kazatel> that's the smart way to go there.
[14:38:53] <andrew_r> $('#loading').show();
[14:38:53] <andrew_r> $.get('/pageSelect.php?id=' + menuBar_page_id)
[14:38:53] <andrew_r>  .done(function(data) { $('#loggedIn_content').html(data); })
[14:38:53] <andrew_r>  .always(function() { $('#loading').hide(); });
[14:39:15] <Velveeta> so my kid just finished slopping together his science fair project, and i was having a hard time trying to decide whether to tell him it was unacceptable, or to just come straight out and say it looked like shit
[14:39:25] <Velveeta> so then i thought "why choose?" and told him both
[14:40:04] <duch_kazatel> and then redid it while yelling and saying "this is why we can't have christmas next year.  in fact - get me your gift from this christmas.  it's mine now."
[14:41:04] <Velveeta> now *there's* an idea
[14:41:09] <andrew_r> Velveeta: science fair project topic?
[14:41:22] <Velveeta> reflexes, whether adults or kids reacted faster
[14:42:34] <andrew_r> groundbreaking...
[14:42:39] <Velveeta> indeed
[14:43:05] <Velveeta> he's not gonna be curing cancer or anything, but i expect that the topic he chooses, he actually puts some effort into
[14:43:27] <duch_kazatel> aaaah. one of those cases.
[14:45:03] <duch_kazatel> i used to do that all the time.  i think my dad eventually just kinda gave up.
[14:49:23] <Velveeta> well, i told him he can't do anything fun until that thing is finished, and since this one's all fucked up, and i'm not gonna run out to the store to get him another display board, that can just run through tomorrow when i get around to it
[14:58:18] <Forest_> Velveeta: its almost ready,are you still here?
[14:58:25] <Velveeta> yep
[15:00:42] <rainabba> I want to dynamicaly populate a SELECT list and have used the focus() event to clear and populate the select but I have to click twice. The first time I get the original list (just one placeholder option) then the 2nd time it actually populates as I'd expect. What do I need to do in order for it to populate and show the first time it's clicked?
[15:00:48] <rainabba> (focused)
[15:01:59] <purger> Hello
[15:02:04] <Forest_> Velveeta: okay its here,there is still a lot of work to do http://obchod-fstore.rhcloud.com/
[15:02:08] <purger> Are you all from jquery?
[15:02:22] <Velveeta> i'm pretty sure practically none of us are from jquery
[15:02:37] <purger> Why not :o
[15:03:00] * rainabba isn't from jquery but is in #jquery
[15:03:02] <Velveeta> forest_ you're throwing errors in your javascript on the register page
[15:03:14] <Velveeta> that's probably what's causing your document.ready not to fire
[15:03:32] <Forest_> Velveeta: how did you find out there are errors?
[15:03:52] <Velveeta> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'touchstart' of undefined: jquery.mobile.customized.min.js:10, Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'setAttribute' of null: camera.js:873
[15:04:05] <Velveeta> forest_: i used my javascript console in devtools
[15:04:42] <Forest_> Velveeta: hmm and that error is not present in the index?
[15:05:16] <Velveeta> forest_: the touchstart one is, but not the one in camera.js
[15:06:26] <Forest_> Velveeta: i am confused now. how can i see the same error like you do? what do i need to download?
[15:06:43] <Velveeta> what browser are you using?
[15:07:07] <Forest_> Velveeta: firefox
[15:07:32] <Velveeta> do you can use firefox's built in developer tools, or get firebug as a plugin for it
[15:08:20] <andrew_r> Forest_: ctrl+shift+k will open the console window in FF
[15:08:51] <Forest_> andrew_r: ah okay but i dont see that error there
[15:09:06] <Velveeta> try refreshing the page
[15:09:15] <Velveeta> sometimes errors won't show if you don't have the console open at the time they're thrown
[15:09:34] <Velveeta> you can also use chrome's dev tools, which will show errors after the fact
[15:10:44] <Forest_> Velveeta: hmm it shows canvas is null to me
[15:11:14] <Forest_> Velveeta: but i think i get it now
[15:11:16] <Velveeta> yepyep
[15:11:26] <Forest_> Velveeta: i dont show slider on register page
[15:11:38] <Forest_> Velveeta: but i am so stupid to call all functions
[15:11:57] <Forest_> Velveeta: okay i try to omit them
[15:12:05] <Velveeta> sounds like a good place to start
[15:12:33] <Forest_> Velveeta: i will let you know about my progress
[15:12:36] <andrew_r> move you calls to start the slideshow onto the "index" view
[15:12:43] <andrew_r> instead of in your template
[15:15:25] <Forest_> i love you guys !
[15:16:08] <Forest_> thank you so much ! god bless you even when i dont believe in him
[15:16:31] <Forest_> but i believe in such kind people as you are
[15:17:14] <Forest_> have a nice day,you saved me a day
[15:18:03] <andrew_r> Velveeta: I think we both deserve tomorrow off :p
[15:18:04] <Velveeta> interesting, i tend to let god blesses bounce off of me from the religious… i don't think i've ever had to let one bounce off of me from a non-beleiver
[15:18:34] <Velveeta> andrew_r: except from our own projects of course
[15:18:56] <Forest_> cya :)
[15:19:07] <Velveeta> adios
[15:21:07] <nicholasschulz> i want this to animate -> 0 before .empty() …. now it empty's at the same time as the animation ….??? $('#loggedIn_content').animate({opacity: 0}).empty();
[15:21:56] <rainabba> I'm dynamically populating a select list using focus(). I call .html('') to clear it, and inside $ajax().success(), .append('<option>....</option>') to populate it. When I click it, the select shows as cleared but I have to click a couple more times before I see the list. Clearly focus() is firing and causing the select to populate, but it's not dropping down and showing as I'd expect (until
[15:21:56] <rainabba> I click 2-3 more times). What's going on?
[15:22:12] <mattdawson> not a jquery question specifically, but does anyone know if window.location.reload do the same thing as a hard refresh in re: memory?
[15:23:23] <rainabba> mattdawson: #javascript has a LOT more people to answer javascript questions
[15:24:43] <Velveeta> rainabba: if it's populating via ajax, could it be that you're not seeing the results when you click just because the request hasn't completed yet?
[15:24:44] <andrew_r> rainabba: are you clearing your list before the ajax call completes?
[15:24:52] <rainabba> If I use mouseenter() then hover for a moment before clicking, I get the behavior I expect, but it requires that I wait for it to load before clicking.
[15:25:13] <mattdawson> rainabba: fair enough ;)
[15:25:22] <Velveeta> sounds to me like it's working perfectly, except that you have to wait for the request to complete
[15:25:31] <Velveeta> but that's the nature of ajax requests, they're not immediate
[15:26:03] <rainabba> andrew_r: I am clearing inside the success handler for the ajax call. I've tried calling .click() at the end of my load (inside success) even. Perhaps the browser is showing me the list before it's populated then it doesn't refresh while expanded. If so, what's the best way to handle this?
[15:26:17] <andrew_r> mattdawson: location.reload() is the same as hitting F5 or clicking the reload button
[15:26:45] <Velveeta> rainabba: i don't think there's a programmatic way to trigger a select list to open
[15:26:53] <andrew_r> rainabba: create a string of your <option> elements, then do a single $('select').html(options);
[15:26:56] <Velveeta> so you couldn't force it to open when the request completes, as far as i know
[15:27:00] <andrew_r> ie: don't clear it, just replace
[15:27:06] <rainabba> Sounds like I need to cancel the event, load up, then cause it to show the list with something like .click() but I don't want to start hacking where I don't need to.
[15:27:19] <Velveeta> .click() won't cause it to open though
[15:27:29] <Velveeta> at least i'm pretty sure
[15:27:31] <mattdawson> andrew_r: that's what i'm hoping - and it makes sense - it just also feels like something that might vary between browsers.
[15:27:44] <rainabba> andrew_r: How do you mean?
[15:28:13] <andrew_r> it's always better to create a string containing all your html, instead of looping and doing append()'s
[15:28:40] <Velveeta> rightio
[15:28:55] <Velveeta> but in either case, you won't be able to programmatically click that thing open when it's done
[15:29:25] <andrew_r> instead of append, do options +=  '<option value="' + opt.val + '">' + opt.text + '</option>';
[15:29:46] <andrew_r> then $('select').html(options); -- don't do $('select').html('');
[15:31:09] <rainabba> ahh
[15:31:23] <andrew_r> Velveeta: agree, I don't think you can open a standard select in code, however he could use a dropdown plugin that wraps selects
[15:31:33] <Velveeta> right
[15:31:52] <rainabba> andrew_r: Very nice. Much faster too. Thank you.
[15:31:57] <Velveeta> also, this guy came up with a hack that uses a 2nd dropdown with its size large enough to show options, and probably some positioning: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2923600/how-to-automatically-expand-html-select-element-in-javascript
[15:32:00] <andrew_r> rainabba: so that's an option, some kind of "fancy" dropdown plugin that would allow you to open the list in code
[15:32:09] <Velveeta> but that seems a little overkill to me
[15:33:24] <rainabba> andrew_r: That with mouseenter instead of focus makes for very smooth UX.
[15:35:17] <rainabba> andrew_r: My next evolution (or idea had that not worked) was/is KnockoutJS using an observable and dynamically applying a template. The entire reason for this need is that my UI has MANY such selects but I have no way of knowing how many will be used so I'm presenting them but not loading them until the user interacts. This has the added benefit of letting me keep options fresh because this
[15:35:17] <rainabba> is getting to be a one-page app.
[15:36:08] <Velveeta> that should work fine
[15:36:43] <andrew_r> write a jquery plugin so you can call $('select#someId').populateSelect(dataUrl);
[15:36:47] <andrew_r> an idea anyway
[15:37:22] <Velveeta> the nice thing about the KO observables though, is that they help with code organization a little more than some jquery spaghetti event bindings
[15:37:33] <Velveeta> although they move a lot of that logic into the presentation, which i don't like
[15:38:01] <Velveeta> i'm in the process of whipping up a minimalist MVVM framework for our company, along with my own observable object model
[15:38:20] <Velveeta> though i haven't figured out if i want to base it on kapit's polyfill, or polymer's, or just roll my own implementation
[15:39:05] <rainabba> I'm moving from having nearly all my logic/code/data in one file so just about anything is an improvement. Going to SQLXML (SQL + IIS + XML + XSL -> HTML) to Node.js
[15:40:01] <rainabba> Velveeta: Polymer for me. Knowing a small handful of Chrome engineers and a couple VIPs who like it is plenty for me :)
[15:40:19] * rainabba means "knowing" quite literally
[15:41:03] <Velveeta> i have a huge mental boner for polymer, i just wish its support matrix was a little larger
[15:41:17] <Velveeta> but their observable object polyfill is so fucking convoluted
[15:42:05] <Velveeta> i'm starting a project right now w/ node/mysql/elasticsearch on the back end, and probably backbone marionette on the front end, potentially w/ some polymer components just for fun
[15:47:46] <Pyche> hi, im having trouble using variables from a json .ajax return. the ajax call works, json returned to debugger. but when i try to use the variables they are coming back as undefined. ive tried a few variations of setting the variable but am stuck -- any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/kg83b/
[15:50:08] <rainabba> Pyche: Sounds like the variable has fallen out of scope. pastebin your code.
[15:50:14] <Pyche> http://jsfiddle.net/kg83b/
[15:50:42] <Pyche> line 20-21 is failing
[15:53:39] <Velveeta> what is response if you console.log it? is it valid or undefined also?
[15:54:25] <Pyche> valid
[15:54:50] <Velveeta> can you paste what it shows for its format?
[15:54:56] <Velveeta> in a pastebin or fiddle?
[15:55:20] <Pyche> it starts with [Object] in Chrome debug
[15:55:37] <Velveeta> oh wait, is that it at the top of your current fiddle?
[15:55:57] <Pyche> yea, the json is at the top of the fiddle
[15:56:02] <Velveeta> looks like it should be this: response[0].datesent
[15:56:15] <Velveeta> lowercase
[15:56:29] <Pyche> doesn't work
[15:56:52] <Pyche> christ.
[15:56:54] <Pyche> now it does ?
[15:57:06] <Pyche> talking it out always helps.
[15:57:08] <Velveeta> all of your commented-out examples were with uppercase keys
[15:57:20] <Velveeta> response[0].DATESENT vs .datesent
[15:58:40] <Pyche> thanks velveeta
[15:59:09] <Velveeta> no problem
[16:26:47] <ulipo1991> hi everyone
[16:27:54] <ulipo1991> i have a stupid doubt about $.ajax(), if i use type: "POST" and data: 'varData' am forced to give an url?
[16:29:18] <Pyche> ulipo1991: i think url is always required.
[16:30:05] <ulipo1991> ohh, i have used without url and it worked well
[16:30:30] <ulipo1991> but to workaround that i added a success function that .load( my content)
[16:31:28] <ulipo1991> so all was fine, but now am trying to send a varData from the jquery to the estado.php and looks like the varData is not going
[16:32:46] <Pyche> pastebin it
[16:33:08] <ulipo1991> ok
[16:35:39] <ulipo1991> here is: http://hastebin.com/fiyipamigu.cs
[16:41:33] <Pyche> arent you missing a variable name? like --> data: {myVar: varData}
[16:43:13] <ulipo1991> i want to supposed that now because am sending the var throught the data: varData and after that am just catching the var with the $name = $_POST['varData'];
[16:43:37] <ulipo1991> but i really don't know now :/
[16:44:48] <Pyche> change it to data: {myVar: varData}
[16:45:28] <ulipo1991> hmm ok
[16:45:29] <Pyche> that'll hit the post
[16:45:52] <Pyche> $name = $_POST['myVar'];
[16:50:43] <ulipo1991> sorry Pyche, not working
[16:50:58] <ulipo1991> trying to catch the myVar in the php
[16:51:09] <ulipo1991> and looks won't echo
[16:52:34] <Pyche> update the bin with your new ajax
[16:56:24] <ulipo1991> Pyche: here is http://hastebin.com/vuleramoco.cs
[17:10:08] <joshkurz> are there any plans to move the test runner to anything else other than the current one?
[17:11:02] <Pyche> ulipo1991: get rid of var myVar = varData;
[17:11:44] <lenswipee> replace with var $myVar = $carData;
[17:13:24] <ulipo1991> Pyche: ok
[17:13:30] <ulipo1991> lesnwipee: ok
[17:13:46] <joshkurz> it seems the current one is a little antiquated
[17:15:36] <lenswipee> joshkurz: you like to not be heard with your fancy words? ;)
[17:21:39] <gp> Can anyone help me display server generated error response with JQM?  I want to show the error page returned by the server instead of the jqm "error loading" popup
[17:22:09] <duch_kazatel> i assume you mean "jquery mobile?
[17:22:18] <gp> yes
[17:24:13] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14408355/using-a-server-response-for-pageloaderrormessage-in-jquery-mobile - does this help?
[17:24:32] <ulipo1991> still doesn't work, but thanks a lot guys ill do some workaround and ill have to avoid sending the data :/
[17:24:41] <ulipo1991> anyways thanks a lot :D
[17:24:43] <ulipo1991> cya
[17:25:32] <gp> duch_kazatel: unfortunately no.  that just changes the text of the error popup
[17:26:14] <gp> duch_kazatel: my error html from the server is a valid jquery-mobile "page".  i want to display it as is like jqm does with a typical 200 response
[17:26:47] <gp> I have found a few questions on SO and other sites but no answers that do this
[17:27:15] <gp> And that event is now depreciated
[17:29:52] <tlhiv_laptop> i'm using jquery.tablesorter and i would like to have the <thead> have position: fixed so that when the table is scrolled vertically the column headings do not scroll ... however, when i set this with css styles it affects the widths of the columns as well :-(
[17:30:16] <joshkurz> lenswipee ha. Dont you agree with me though? I mean PHP to run your unit tests. Come on. Time to move into the new year with some style.
[17:36:34] <grafi> ugh
[17:38:07] <grafi> everything is fuck as slow
[17:38:14] <grafi> waaaaaaaaaaagh

[17:39:53] <shoky> you are the world
[17:40:01] <grafi> aaaawwww
[17:40:04] <grafi> :)
[17:40:36] <shoky> that's not what i meant!
[17:40:47] <grafi> hahaha
[17:40:52] <grafi> cant take it back now
[17:40:53] <grafi> :P
[17:41:03] <shoky> OK *SNUGGLE*
[17:41:19] <grafi> http://i.imgur.com/MqgZmgI.png
[17:41:20] <grafi> :P
[17:41:30] <shoky> ;p
[17:41:39] <grafi> any exiting new years resolutions you wanna break next year?
[17:41:42] <grafi> ^^
[17:44:00] <shoky> i hope to be even more reclusive
[17:44:11] <shoky> and uhhh, frown a lot
[17:45:19] <javalover> ok guys Shoky especially mad love brah
[17:45:47] <javalover> my issue is this & it's brand new :-)   I have meta tags but i'm using .load from jquery to display special pages
[17:46:01] <javalover> hmm actually
[17:46:13] <shoky> hmm
[17:46:14] <javalover> i guess I could decode the meta tags first
[17:46:20] <javalover> and then grab the actual page
[17:46:39] <javalover> just seems out of order
[17:46:56] <javalover> especially since I was using the .load() page to decode which content I want
[17:47:17] <javalover> but yeah maybe that's only way since bots/crawlers don't use jquery
[17:47:46] <shoky> mad love
[17:48:02] <javalover> haha
[17:48:11] <javalover> you've been with me since beginning on this project
[17:48:15] <javalover> and i must say we've come a long way
[17:48:40] <javalover> but yeah I think this is only way just establish meta tag via php
[17:49:19] <shoky> we've come so far i'm sure you already know what advice i'd give you if i understood what your issue is
[17:49:42] <javalover> yeah
[17:49:48] <javalover> tbh there isn't a way to do it through jquery
[17:49:49] <shoky> so far you said you've got meta tags and you're using .load to display "special pages"
[17:49:54] <shoky> doesn't sound like an issue to me
[17:50:06] <javalover> the issue is in facebook grabbing the meta tags for each page
[17:50:12] <javalover> and indexing for google
[17:50:23] <shoky> see you keep adding more layers to this.. when you haven't even said what the first one is
[17:50:36] <javalover> well it's cuz...meta tags aren't effected by jquery
[17:50:50] <javalover> so i'm realizing that no matter what I can't fix it through jquery
[17:51:09] <shoky> no idea what you're on about ;p i'm going to bed
[17:51:15] <javalover> lol
[17:51:27] <shoky> ~\o
[17:51:36] <javalover> it's very simple, it's just meta tags for each page...but each page is loaded from jquery
[17:51:51] <javalover> so in order to make it work I have to fake it to make it.
[17:52:34] <javalover> so create meta tags in php even though they're showing up on the original page & not the one that will be loaded via .load
[18:07:48] <tieTYT2> why does this print out not-clicked?  detail: 1
[18:07:53] <tieTYT2> err.. http://jsfiddle.net/WudVC/
[18:08:21] <tieTYT2> I'd expect event.originalEvent.detail to be 1
[18:52:16] <nicholasschulz> how can i get the url from the background of the parent div when clicking the button? http://jsfiddle.net/HHNES/
[19:00:59] <ryanneufeld> nicholasschulz: that code doesn't even compile
[19:01:06] <ryanneufeld> check your JS console
[19:01:09] <nicholasschulz> haha sorry
[19:01:10] <ryanneufeld> you're missing some code
[19:01:12] <nicholasschulz> i figured it out
[19:01:24] <ryanneufeld> cool
[19:01:36] <ryanneufeld> also, pro tip: use console.log() instead of alert();
[19:06:09] <nicholasschulz> thanks ;-)
[19:06:45] <duckgoose> bah

[20:05:54] <yan_> anyone know if clone() can deep copy data, but not events?
[20:09:27] <andrew_r> anewbie: $('input[name^=address]').attr('name', function() { return this.name.replace('[1]', ''); }); // possibly - I didn't test it
[20:14:14] <andrew_r> yan_: I think you may have to do something like: var myClonedElements = $('.areaToClone'); myClonedElements.find('*').off();
[20:25:40] <andrew_r> does anyone have any "best practices" as far as how to handle adding/removing HTML in a single page app?

[21:31:24] <nights> hi
[21:31:29] <nights> $( function()
[21:31:39] <nights> this seem a bit unreliable
[21:32:03] <nights> sometimes when its run not the whole DOM seem to be ready
[21:36:31] <Eviltwin> nights: Correct, if you run it when not the whole DOM is ready, it will only return results against the partial DOM
[21:36:46] <Eviltwin> So if you want results from the whole DOM, wait until the whole DOM is ready then use it
[21:39:07] <Wranorn> Does anyone know of a way to determine if a browser supports (or has a plugin/addon/handler) for a certain mime type?
[21:42:03] <Velveeta> what's all this about document.ready running when the dom isn't ready?
