[00:04:39] <DelicateFlower> i want to load jquery from the jquery site but have backup locally to save bandwidth, how do i do that?
[00:26:12] <PatBateman> hi
[00:26:27] <PatBateman> any idea how to add stop function to this plugin? https://github.com/subchild/jquery.slideshowify.js
[00:26:33] <PatBateman> or pause
[00:39:47] <slax0r> hi, I'm loading dynamic content into a div, which is allowed to autoresize to the size of the content, the divs initial width is 200px, but after the content is loaded it can be expanded up to 1000px, how can I get the width after the content was loaded?
[00:40:14] <slax0r> content is being loaded with ajax in success, I've tried obtaining the width after .html(content), but the width is less than it actually is
[00:49:31] <slax0r> nvm, I'm an idiot
[00:57:38] <Snoopal> ive a ajax post. i know that it is triggered but i do not get any response. neither on fail or done any ideas?
[01:04:26] <Snoopal> thats so strange
[01:05:12] <plepzz> Can we see the code?
[01:05:35] <seutje> what does the request status say in the network tab?
[01:05:40] <weems> pastebin.ca
[01:07:55] <Snoopal> http://pastebin.com/X2E335vv
[01:10:07] <Snoopal> any ideas?
[01:13:27] <Uhkis> Snoopal: phone is missing .val()
[01:14:13] <Snoopal> ha! thank you so much! :D
[01:14:57] <Uhkis> Snoopal: maybe next time format correctly and you'll see it instantly ;-)
[01:15:50] <Snoopal> ;)
[01:21:46] <hellothere> hey there YOLOS, well i have this http://fiddle.jshell.net/8Qn8r/ and i want to add to the error messages an animation that goes to the error
[01:21:50] <hellothere> any ideas?
[01:24:12] <lite> hellothere: why on earth would you refer to us as 'yolos' ?
[01:26:14] <Snoopal> lol i thing he has no idea what this means ...
[01:28:53] <hellothere> i dunno i feel like a yolo :D
[01:28:58] <hellothere> yolo bros
[01:29:47] <Uhkis> just for that terrible insult, no help for you!
[01:31:42] <hellothere> ... ok well i guess u cant help thats the reason
[01:36:24] <glontu> hi
[01:36:35] <glontu> i am defining an object with internal methods
[01:36:58] <glontu> how can i use $....on('eventname', this.myfunction) ?
[01:37:19] <glontu> i want to bind on an external object's event with a method from my own object
[01:38:10] <DavyB> Hi guys, i got this form where items are added and a total price is shown. Now i don't want the user to leave the page (back button, click of link, etc) untill the paymentmethod is filled in. This is what i got so far but it checks forms, how can i change this so it looks at total? http://pastebin.com/qj1SWSBS
[01:40:03] <Cork> glontu: on('', function() { variable.myfunction(); });
[01:40:38] <Cork> glontu: if you use this.myfunction you will lose the connection to the object
[01:40:58] <Cork> glontu: also remember you can't use this in a function defined in the function
[01:41:06] <Cork> so you want to store it before you do the call
[01:41:07] <glontu> Thanks Cork i'll keep that in mind. I used var me = this and it worked
[01:41:09] <Cork> ex. var self = this;
[01:41:19] <glontu> thanks
[01:41:23] <Cork> np
[01:42:11] <Cork> Davey: you can't prevent the user from leaving the page
[01:42:18] <Cork> you have to deal with them leaving
[01:42:37] <Davey> Cork: how do you know what I can and can't do? (Also, that was meant for DavyB)
[01:42:56] <DavyB> now i get a confirm dialog, wich is fine. Can't  figure out how to look at just the total though. If it has a total set, it should give the dialog, else just leave it
[01:43:39] <Cork> DavyB: what i meant is browsers are removing the support for blocking users from leaving the page
[01:43:59] <Cork> so your code have to handle that
[01:44:36] <Cork> beforeunload has never worked in opera, and firefox is about to remove it
[01:44:52] <Cork> i think chrome is working in the same direction, but not sure there
[01:45:15] <DavyB> then is there a general way to prevent from leaving before submitting the form that will work?
[01:45:24] <plepzz> Do any of you know if it possible to somehow preload a page before redirecting to it? - The thing is we have a light website, that is as a login to as .NET backend. And the backend is using Sencha Framework, which apparently have to load 4mb every time, since the company hosting the backend, is denying to enable caching (Don't ask me why)
[01:45:25] <DavyB> do'nt understand why they would do that
[01:45:37] <seutje> educate them :P
[01:45:39] <Cork> DavyB: no, that is the point of the change they do
[01:45:47] <seutje> or secretly post it in the background
[01:46:00] <hellothere> Cork: http://fiddle.jshell.net/3kc2r/1/ , Do you know how can I add an html body .animate in the messages: ?
[01:46:01] <seutje> but then ur just being dishonest, sorta
[01:46:45] <DavyB> so what i got so far will be useless soon.
[01:46:50] <DavyB> damn
[01:46:53] <Cork> hellothere: i don't use the validate plugin so no not really
[01:47:04] <hellothere> ah ok thx :)
[01:49:03] <seutje> hellothere: u can implement a errorPlacement handler iirc
[01:50:00] <seutje> http://jqueryvalidation.org/validate/ why doesn't this have anchors I can link to? q.q
[01:50:29] <seutje> hellothere: might wanna fix ur object declaration and close ur click handler thingy
[01:56:32] <Teza19> Hello, I'm trying to use 'SMINT' as a baseline for my website. I have one problem - if you scroll down half way and then hit 'refresh' the menu stays at the bottom instead of 'resetting'
[02:02:13] <hellothere> seutje: thanks for that, ive tried it before thing is i dunno what to if against in the errorplacement
[02:03:19] <hellothere> seutje: http://fiddle.jshell.net/3kc2r/2/   thats what ive done so far
[02:03:27] <hellothere> ive tested the if against other things but..
[02:04:00] <woozly> guys, which widget you can advice for Chooser (Popup menu, autocomplete). I have bunch of 3,000 records, kind of [{ 'user': 'Andrea Garcia', 'id': 549594 }, ... ] and I need to attach popup for multiple places on one page (I do not want to duplicate <select> multiple times). And I need to have chosen variant by id for forms.
[02:21:20] <seutje> hellothere: under what conditions do u want to animate?
[02:21:43] <hellothere> well if required: false animate
[02:21:50] <seutje> what's required supposed to hold?
[02:22:05] <seutje> also, ur object declaration is still off
[02:22:07] <hellothere> seutje: required: false animate  or messages :  { animate }
[02:22:31] <hellothere> well in the rules txtcomments required: true
[02:22:46] <hellothere> if they are false i want to animate to the specific error area
[02:23:11] <hellothere> scrolltop thats what i want to do actually cause for somereason the postback is not scrolling down to the error
[02:26:09] <seutje> $(element).is('.required') or something?
[02:26:46] <hellothere> yes thats eventually what it does that .validate thing
[02:27:27] <hellothere> so rules  { 'txtcomments' { required: true}} is actually exactly what you said
[02:28:49] <seutje> hellothere: actually, if the placement of the errors doesn't depend on the conditional, it's probably better to use the showErrors handler
[02:28:54] <hellothere> but now i need to turn that into : If that rule is false so the txtcomments is empty then animate. (scrolltop (errormessagE)
[02:30:30] <seutje> hellothere: error placement is only called when it doesn't validate
[02:31:29] <hellothere> yes and i tried error placement as you can see http://fiddle.jshell.net/3kc2r/2/ here
[02:31:54] <seutje> wtf
[02:32:00] <seutje> required is undefined
[02:32:06] <seutje> that object declaration is still off
[02:32:20] <hellothere> yes but what should i check against
[02:32:30] <seutje> the bind function call is still unclosed
[02:32:31] <hellothere> txtcomments.getcontent == 0 ?
[02:32:47] <seutje> txtcomments is undefined
[02:33:21] <seutje> u can grab it from this.rules[element.name].required
[02:34:10] <seutje> also, might wanna look up on the docs for $.fn.is(), cause that's not how you use it
[02:34:32] <hellothere> so the actual thing would go  if (this.rules[txtcomment].required == true) ?
[02:34:53] <seutje> tell me, wtf is this txtcomment ?
[02:35:00] <seutje> what does it contain/point to?
[02:35:05] <hellothere> txtcomment is the id of the txtbox
[02:35:10] <hellothere> in html that is inherited
[02:35:29] <seutje> afaict, it's undefined
[02:35:54] <seutje> it resembles a key ur using somewhere else, but not even entirely
[02:36:21] <PatBateman2> is it a difference btwn .trigger('click') and .click() ?
[02:37:12] <hellothere> hmm i am writting against aspforms , so ive defined the aspforms in the current js as a masterform, so when i do masterform.validate it knows that it will pull the ids from there
[02:37:19] <hellothere> so it is actually defined :)
[02:37:22] <Linus_> hey folks! i am working with jquery and polymer. i know how to create shadow doms, but I don't know how to access elements with jquery inside a shadow dom. do you guys have any idea?
[02:37:27] <Linus_> thanks in advance :)
[02:38:17] <seutje> hellothere: ah, mysterious globals I'm expected to pick up by scent?
[02:38:41] <seutje> so you'd actually re-query the DOM based on a global instead of using a reference you have at hand?
[02:39:02] <seutje> also, it's ID is irrelevant, it only cares about name afict
[02:39:05] <seutje> afaict
[02:39:11] <seutje> its*
[02:39:38] <hellothere> ye and thats why propably jquery fails on this project massively in general
[02:40:37] <hellothere> so what the people have actually done in this project is they've written weird c# constructors that are handled by both js and asp ...
[02:41:07] <hellothere> and i am banging my head to understand why would u do such a disasterys thing esxpecially when ur using jquery 1.4.2 ...
[02:48:40] <seutje> hellothere: http://fiddle.jshell.net/3kc2r/5/
[02:50:19] <seutje> sure it doesn't just fails due to the syntax errors?
[02:50:32] <seutje> man, my grammars are so broken today
[02:51:55] <hellothere> haha
[02:52:29] <hellothere> well ill check right now seutje thx for helping btw, thats another thing with jquery, i aint so familiar with syntax:) i am looking into getting more into the js stuff as internet is getting there
[02:53:01] <seutje> should really start with a solid base of vanilla JS
[02:54:03] <seutje> hellothere: I'd definitely recommend http://jqfundamentals.com/ as a resource for learning the basics concepts
[02:54:22] <hellothere> oh thx for that just bookmarked it xD
[02:54:33] <hellothere> i got very basic experience with writting jquery
[02:54:38] <seutje> it starts with a javascript basics bit
[02:54:44] <hellothere> i mainly used it for a reddis DB against my api
[02:55:11] <hellothere> but now that ive developed my Api i am looking into typing a new site into JS rather than c# or python
[02:55:37] <hellothere> cause through the api i can just make checks and can have every validation in js :)
[02:55:39] <jlebrech> i've added a click event to a div, but when I click on an element inside of the div it fires an even for the element inside. tried stopPropagation. but it should only fire the event on what i've specified no?
[02:57:53] <jlebrech> ok, think i'm doing .target. maybe should be something else
[02:59:18] <seutje> hellothere: you mean in node? it's a bit different there as you don't have a DOM you have to wait for and all that
[02:59:50] <seutje> jlebrech: events bubble up from the element that's hit to the body
[03:00:04] <seutje> jlebrech: got an example of the code ur using?
[03:04:30] <seutje> jlebrech: maybe this will illustrate what the difference is between this and e.target in delegated handlers: http://jsfiddle.net/a6W4H/
[03:05:04] <Linus_> hi! how can I add jQuery to a shadow-com  ?
[03:05:19] <Cork> shadow-com?
[03:05:22] <Linus_> sry… shadow-dom
[03:05:43] <Cork> do you mean a fragment?
[03:06:01] <Linus_> i mean a polymer shadow dom
[03:06:22] <Cork> ugg no clue
[03:06:24] <Cork> never used it
[03:06:45] <zulcc> .hasClass('[class^=menu]') ?
[03:07:51] <Linus_> shadow dom is part of html5 spec: http://www.w3.org/TR/shadow-dom/ …
[03:08:12] <Cork> Linus_: sure, but it is far from cross browser yet
[03:08:28] <Cork> and there for pre usage in my book
[03:08:53] <Cork> i've looked at the specs and a few examples
[03:08:56] <Cork> but never used it
[03:09:12] <glontu> how can i fire an event globally ?
[03:09:26] <Cork> glontu: globally?
[03:09:32] <Karliky> window.fireEvent({global : true})
[03:09:36] <Linus_> I use it with google dart and in their spec there is written: Polymer.dart is tested against IE9, IE10, Safari 6, latest Chrome, latest Firefox, and latest Chrome for Android.
[03:09:37] <Cork> events fire on a dom element and bubbles
[03:09:46] <Cork> there is not "global"
[03:09:49] <Cork> *no
[03:10:26] <glontu> i want various things to just listen for a event with a name and not have to bind to a specific object
[03:10:38] <glontu> will binding to document work ?
[03:11:38] <Cork> glontu: you can add a $.event.special event
[03:11:48] <Cork> have it collect the elements that binds the event
[03:11:59] <Cork> and then loop the list and fire the event on those elements
[03:12:09] <Cork> other then that; no there isn't a way
[03:12:12] <zulcc> How do i correctly wildcard here: .hasClass('[class^=menu]')
[03:12:27] <Cork> zulcc: hasClass doesn't work like that
[03:12:40] <Cork> also you should NEVER use partial of class names
[03:12:46] <Cork> use multiple classes instead
[03:13:08] <zulcc> Ah! Thanks!
[03:13:10] <Cork> class="menu-something" => class="menu something"
[03:13:22] <Cork> then you can just check .hashClass('menu')
[03:13:36] <Cork> *hasClass
[03:14:11] <decx> attr('[class^='partial']') will work though ;)
[03:14:20] <decx> *""
[03:14:28] <Cork> well then your not selecting on a class
[03:14:32] <Cork> your seelecting on an attribute
[03:14:36] <Cork> and no attr() won't work
[03:14:56] <Cork> $('[class^="partial"]') would work
[03:15:11] <decx> yes hence *""
[03:15:12] <Cork> but it wouldn't handle elements with several classes
[03:15:25] <Cork> and it is the wrong way to do it
[03:15:28] <hellothere> seutje: in that validate thing is there a way to say for example the textbox has txtbox reqruired:true which returns a message :please enter something or whatever, is there a way to hide the button if there is a text and it doesnt return that error message?
[03:15:32] <jlebrech> seutje: get what you mean, I could have used this instead of currentTarget
[03:15:36] <Cork> classes has built in support to do it the fast and correct way
[03:15:41] <decx> it's wrong, but it'll work ;)
[03:15:43] <Cork> you are much better of doing it that way
[03:16:25] <decx> if we always had to do the right thing then jquery wouldnt be as popular as it is
[03:18:43] <Cork> decx: and the web would be a much better place
[03:19:09] <Cork> where pages wouldn't burn through cpu time just cause the site developer was to lazy to check how it is meant to be done
[03:20:14] <decx> nope, accessbility like that may open up the floodgates for ignorance but also gives a whole new segment of people who never did any programming an avenue to express themselves
[03:20:26] <decx> worth it
[03:20:53] <Cork> decx: that would be the same philosophy as html
[03:21:06] <Cork> and the horror of "it is the browsers job to make this work"
[03:21:13] <Cork> no matter what junk the writer throws at it
[03:21:39] <decx> if one good idea isn't lost in the process then it's worth it
[03:21:55] <decx> and ideas get lost all the time because of artificial constraints
[03:22:19] <decx> but new ideas are the most important part of humanity imho
[03:22:29] <Cork> not if 10 man years has to be plown down into writing super complex engines to parse and error correct the gue
[03:24:21] <decx> i know what you mean, but i don't agree
[03:24:27] <seutje> hellothere: u can access the messages in this.messages
[03:25:00] <Cork> decx: so you mean the extra memory use, the cpu time every unit that wants to show it
[03:25:10] <Cork> is worth the cost just so the developer can be lazy?
[03:25:52] <decx> we've been looking for tools to make our jobs easier for a few ten thousand years
[03:26:04] <decx> so we can be more lazy
[03:26:32] <Cork> decx: lazy developers is the plague of todays computing
[03:26:44] <Cork> and has been since the late 90's
[03:28:24] <Cork> i find it much more reasonable to have tools to help the writers correct the mistake
[03:28:33] <Cork> then to move the responsibility to the viewer
[03:29:39] <decx> eh, that's just semantics ;)
[03:29:46] <Cork> uh no
[03:29:49] <Cork> far from it
[03:30:25] <decx> *make better tools that are easier to use so we have more time*
[03:30:31] <lemonsparrow> need help with this date format function http://pastebin.com/Jmmnvqtr
[03:30:35] <Cork> it is comparing optimized and carefully compiled programs to someone just wrapping the script in a file and let the other end just do the best they can with it
[03:30:39] <lemonsparrow> formatDate("Wed Jan 01 2014 00:00:00 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)") returns "1/1/13" where as it should be "1/1/14"
[03:30:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: you had helped me with that function logic 2 days back... :)
[03:31:11] <rosieres> how do I check if 3 <div> in a row are followed by each other while the same item can be also on a page but nut 3 times in a row
[03:31:41] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you can't throw random date strings at Date
[03:31:56] <Cork> it only supports the iso standard and us date format
[03:32:32] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I string I have passed to it is what I get exactly from the back end
[03:32:49] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I pass the date to it..
[03:33:11] <Cork> lemonsparrow: yes, but like i said, you can't expect Date to parse that
[03:33:30] <rosieres> are next() and index my friends ?
[03:33:37] <decx> rosieres $('div + div + div').hide().prev('div').hide().prev('div').hide() looks ridiculous but does that
[03:33:48] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so how to get this fixed.. so that It just formats the date for me and nothing else.. by picking up date, month and year alone ?
[03:33:52] <Cork> lemonsparrow: rfc 2822 and ISO 8601
[03:33:59] <Cork> those are the only two supported
[03:34:04] <decx> div + div + div selects the last div in a row of 3
[03:34:06] <rosieres> decx: fine :-) I´ll try
[03:34:08] <Cork> (and the later can't be with spaces)
[03:34:19] <Cork> lemonsparrow: you need to parse the string your self
[03:34:27] <Cork> and give the values to Date
[03:34:32] <Cork> or just do it all your self
[03:35:31] <hellothere> seutje: i fixed it :) used submitHandler: function () {disabled button and make spinner appear}
[03:35:32] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I could still use date.getMonth() date.getDay() and all right ?
[03:35:57] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I need a lil help on this.. really oblivious to the date formatting stuffs in javascript
[03:35:59] <Cork> lemonsparrow: if you get the correct date and day into it sure
[03:36:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: javascript has VERY little to help you
[03:36:25] <Cork> js supports exactly 2 date formats
[03:36:27] <lemonsparrow> Cork: date and month i think are fine here in the method
[03:36:32] <Cork> if you want anything else your on your own
[03:36:36] <Cork> and need to write it all your self
[03:36:49] <lemonsparrow> Cork: I think its about the year.. that I am getting issue... if you look at the o/p
[03:36:56] <Cork> lemonsparrow: don't expect Date() do handle that string correctly
[03:37:07] <Cork> it might find something right now, but it migth also totally fail in the future
[03:37:14] <Cork> you shouldn't use it for this
[03:37:53] <lemonsparrow> Cork: also for Jan 1 any year.. I get Jan 1 actula_year -1 but for any other date.. like even Jan 9th year... i get Jan 9th and the right year
[03:38:14] <Cork> lemonsparrow: like i said the string you give it means you can't trust the result
[03:38:22] <lemonsparrow> Cork: ok
[03:38:25] <Cork> you SHOULD NOT USE IT
[03:38:34] <lemonsparrow> Cork: so what's the fool proof solution to this ?
[03:39:00] <Cork> either write a parser for the string and use the values to create a Date object
[03:39:05] <Cork> or grab a lib that does it for you
[03:39:18] <Cork> native doesn't really have anything to help you
[03:39:34] <lemonsparrow> Cork: parser is gonna be too lengthy ? :) or simple ?
[03:39:50] <Cork> lemonsparrow: depends on your needs
[03:39:59] <Cork> but ya, fiddling with dates in js is a pain
[03:40:03] <lemonsparrow> Cork: my needs are simple
[03:41:44] <glontu> can multiple things subscribe to an event and get notified at the same time ?
[03:42:07] <glontu> or will the event be stoped by the first listener ?
[03:42:12] <lemonsparrow> Cork: what about String(myDate.getYear()).slice(-2) instead of String(myDate.getUTCFullYear()).slice(-2)
[03:42:19] <lemonsparrow> Cork: returns 14 instead of 13
[03:42:25] <Cork> glontu: well same time in the form after each other
[03:42:35] <glontu> close enough
[03:42:43] <Cork> lemonsparrow: check what year is in the date object
[03:42:59] <Cork> most likely you get the wrong value there cause it parses your string wrongly; like i've said over and over again now
[03:44:36] <lemonsparrow> Cork: 2014
[03:44:37] <Psi|4ward> How to make a $.ajax GET request WITH a content-body?
[03:45:01] <Cork> Psi|4ward: by definition you can't
[03:45:09] <Cork> get don't have a body, by spec
[03:45:16] <lite> so, clicking back and forth between two tabs is causing a major memory leak and it would appear that the culprit is something called ColVis. I took a screenshot of its retaining tree looks like this : http://imgur.com/1C8VIA6 - This cant be right, right ?
[03:45:26] <Cork> Psi|4ward: a get + body == post
[03:46:20] <Psi|4ward> Cork: sure? imho theres no limitation for that
[03:46:31] <Cork> Psi|4ward: yes i'm sure
[03:48:11] <Psi|4ward> hmm dont find any paragraph forbidding it
[03:48:34] <Psi|4ward> but dosnt matter, found a way to encapsulate the body within a query parameter
[03:50:30] <FernandoBasso> Greetings honorable designers and developers. I have a menu that animates and shows up when the user clicks on a certain area. I wish to close the menu when clicking anywhere in the body. The problem is that when I click in the area to open the menu, that area is also the body, so the menu opens and readily closes. What approach could I take?
[03:51:23] <Cork> Psi|4ward: "Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect."
[03:51:58] <Cork> Psi|4ward: and that part is very important cause GET calls is often cached so things risk to break if you use get for those things
[03:52:38] <Psi|4ward> Cork: i know but wrapping the GET request Parameters in the query String with ? is the same es warpping it in a JSON and send it in the content-body
[03:53:04] <Psi|4ward> important is the fact that GET can be cached and sould never alter the data
[03:53:09] <decx> FernandoBasso the easiest way is a 100%x100% overlay behind your menu that acts as a clickzone, like in a modal window. for another way check out this: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/Ua9wZ/
[03:53:12] <Psi|4ward> ElasticSearch uses this
[03:53:21] <Psi|4ward> and for me it makes totally sense
[03:53:59] <FernandoBasso> decx: Thanks.
[04:05:20] <walidvb> hey guys, i'm using the great swiper plugin, but I get a behavior I can't get rid of..
[04:06:32] <walidvb> basically, I have a nested slideshow(horz, vert), and one of this slide show are two slides compsed of text. for some reason, the 2 1170px wide divs won't fit side by side in the 2340px container. they're 3 px too large
[04:06:38] <walidvb> try for yourself: http://cf.vbbros.net/sites/all/modules/custom/angupal/app/index.html
[04:06:52] <walidvb> if you make the first slide 3 px smaller, it works..
[04:21:39] <decx> inline-block doesn't ignore whitespace walidvb
[04:21:54] <walidvb> decx: but where is that whitespace?
[04:22:04] <decx> anywhere you break a line
[04:22:05] <walidvb> should I whitespace:no-wrap?
[04:22:17] <decx> it's between the elements
[04:22:25] <walidvb> explaining why it works with images?
[04:22:32] <decx> also #bio .slides .slide overrides the inline-block with a block
[04:22:43] <walidvb> sry, wrong version online
[04:23:01] <walidvb> so solution would be to no-wrap #bio .slides ?
[04:23:59] <decx> well i removed the block in #bio .slides .slide and they are next to each other now
[04:25:31] <walidvb> hm
[04:25:33] <walidvb> lemme try
[04:26:25] <decx> i might have fiddled somewhere else as well and forgot, having a boring phonecall simultanously
[04:26:26] <ph88> how can i check if jQueryUI is defined ?  for jQuery i use  window.jQuery
[04:26:49] <decx> indow.jQuery.ui
[04:26:51] <decx> w*
[04:26:57] <ph88> how do you know ??
[04:27:01] <decx> i use it
[04:27:03] <walidvb> hehe
[04:27:06] <ph88> ok :P
[04:27:16] <ph88> what about this one   //cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/spin.js/1.2.7/spin.min.js  ??
[04:27:24] <walidvb> decx: i think you have fiddled, indeed
[04:28:19] <ph88> decx: how can i know if spin is defined ?
[04:28:32] <decx> window.Spinner
[04:28:34] <walidvb> decx: so, indeed, applying nowrap to the .slides does the trick
[04:29:03] <walidvb> does nbsp show because the content of .slides has somewhere text?
[04:30:10] <decx> not sure why it's only on text
[04:31:25] <ph88> decx: what about this one  http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/underscore.js/1.5.2/underscore-min.js ??
[04:32:17] <decx> if you want to check that much stuff you might want to look into require.js
[04:32:40] <ph88> but then i have to rewrite my scrips and wrap them in require.js code o_O
[04:32:53] <walidvb> decx: thanks for the help, got smth working
[04:33:03] <decx> but window.Underscore should work
[04:33:09] <ph88> cool thx decx
[04:33:55] <ph88> decx: i have 9 more scripts ..
[04:34:02] <decx> lol
[04:34:30] <decx> check your console and look at the window object ;)
[04:34:40] <ph88> i need to check all if the cdn fails and then it need to use a copy from the server directly
[04:35:49] <lite> in my search for memory leaks ive come across the following listener. it would appear that this may be causing old inited_tables to never get removed - could this be true?  https://gist.github.com/anonymous/67021dd70cc41840f83f
[04:36:33] <markg85> Hi jquery folks. Could someone take a look at a small code example: http://sc2.nl/trailer_test/fu.html The issue: The static added link works (youtube opens in a popup) the dynamically added links don't open in a popup yet their structure is exactly the same.
[04:36:44] <markg85> i'm completely out of ideas on how to fix it
[04:36:47] <ph88> decx: do you know why i get only this error?   Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found) https://localhost/app_dev.php/en/js/underscore-min-1.5.2.js
[04:37:13] <markg85> I've tried different jquery versions, 1.x and 2.x. No change (obviously)
[04:37:28] <decx> no https support on localhost
[04:37:56] <ph88> decx: but why does it try to load from localhost ?
[04:38:07] <decx> probably because window.Underscore doesnt work ;)
[04:38:14] <ph88> -___-
[04:38:15] <ph88> lol
[04:38:20] <ph88> you tricked me !!!!!!
[04:38:20] <markg85> so if someone would be so kind to take a look.. I'd really appreciate that :)
[04:38:21] <decx> i just checked and it doesnt ^^
[04:39:53] <decx> markg85 lightbox initialized only the elements that are in the dom on load
[04:40:15] <markg85> decx: how can you see that?
[04:40:34] <decx> because that's the most frequent problem people come to this channel with
[04:40:56] <PatBateman2> any idea? http://hastebin.com/movacavesa.rb
[04:41:08] <ph88> markg85: starcraft ? :D
[04:41:18] <PatBateman2> so what is I remove ternary condition and remains one
[04:41:26] <markg85> ph88: ?
[04:41:36] <ph88> markg85: sc2 -- starcraft 2
[04:41:43] <markg85> decx: oke, but how can i fix that issue?
[04:41:58] <PatBateman2> ok forget it
[04:42:24] <markg85> ph88: nah, the domain is much older then that. I think it initially was meant for sim city 2
[04:42:32] <decx> there's probably a method for that, but that lightbox script looks pretty static
[04:42:44] <markg85> ph88: but i just picked it up because it was available and i liked the short name
[04:43:17] <markg85> decx: yeah, my problem as well. It "seems so static" and should just work imho..
[04:43:21] <markg85> but it doesn't :p
[04:44:01] <decx> after you load your json you can do $('a.lightbox').easybox()
[04:44:26] <decx> maybe, i never used it
[04:45:09] <zulcc> I'm looking for an element property so that it behaves like "pointer-events: none;", but JS-mouseevents are still triggered. Is that possible?
[04:45:55] <Cork> zulcc: no, you would have to fake that if you want it
[04:46:15] <markg85> decx: Just tried your suggestion (locally). Sadly doesn't work :(
[04:46:18] <Cork> the point of pointer_events: none; is that the element is completely ignored
[04:46:33] <markg85> no errors in the javascript, no nothing..
[04:46:51] <markg85> the javascript console*
[04:47:27] <decx> there should be a way to initialize easybox manually without class="lightbox"
[04:47:40] <zulcc> I need a .on('mouseenter', function() { } ); for an element that is covering the lower half of the viewport with "position: fixed;", but i should still be able to mouse-target the content below. Is that possible?
[04:48:03] <Cork> zulcc: no
[04:48:27] <Cork> like i said, you would have to fake it, by checking the mouse position
[04:48:37] <Cork> (hacky and not fun to maintain)
[04:48:55] <seutje> oh man, propagating pointer position is really not fun
[04:49:10] <seutje> it's like chemical-burn-to-the-genitals-fun
[04:49:19] <ph88> does anyone know how i can detect if underscore.js is defined ??  i don't see anything in globals
[04:49:21] <Cork> heh
[04:49:24] <zulcc> I can imagine that it get's even trickier when you measure everything in em...
[04:49:56] <seutje> ph88: _
[04:50:04] <Cork> ph88: window._ == undefined
[04:50:06] <markg85> decx: but is lightbox the issue at all? I mean, it so happens to be with the content that is dynamically generated, so isn't there a problem there? Am i Injecting it to the dom to early perhaps?
[04:50:20] <Cork> seutje: look at you beating me!
[04:50:32] <ph88> thx seutje, Cork  :)
[04:50:36] <seutje> you went all window and equals on it
[04:50:50] <seutje> (tbh, I took the time to open a fiddle and make sure)
[04:51:06] <Cork> i took the time to read the source :)
[04:51:20] <seutje> but you didn't test! :P
[04:51:47] <markg85> decx: note, i'm using easybox: https://code.google.com/p/easybox/
[04:51:48] <decx> lol it was actually _
[04:52:02] <markg85> decx: huh?
[04:52:06] <decx> ye i saw it in your head
[04:52:20] <seutje> that's just creepy, yo
[04:54:28] <markg85> decx: do you have any other suggestions for me to try?
[04:57:32] <ph88> how can i check if the stuff in this script is defined?  https://github.com/trentrichardson/jQuery-SliderAccess/blob/master/jquery-ui-sliderAccess.js   i don't see anything interesting in my inspector global variables
[04:58:05] <Cork> ph88: $.fn.sliderAccess == undefined
[04:58:31] <ph88> Cork:  maybe window.jQuery.fn.sliderAccess  also works ?
[04:58:36] <Cork> yes
[04:58:40] <ph88> ok thx
[04:59:07] <seutje> y u no strict equals for undefined?
[04:59:19] <seutje> might aswell just !! it, no?
[04:59:25] <seutje> functions are truthy...
[05:02:13] <FernandoBasso> Shouldn't $( '#elem' ).on( 'event' ) work even if #elem is added later, dynamically?
[05:02:24] <seutje> nosir
[05:02:45] <FernandoBasso> What should I use instead?
[05:02:50] <seutje> it queries the DOM for that element and binds an event handler to it, but only if it can actually find it at the time it's being evaluated
[05:03:02] <seutje> $('body').on('event', '#elem', fn)
[05:03:09] <PatBateman2> Cork: any advice to add pause/resume to the plugin: https://github.com/subchild/jquery.slideshowify.js
[05:03:16] <seutje> or something along those lines, as long as you target an element that is a parent and doesn't change
[05:05:56] <FernandoBasso> seutje: $( 'body' ).on( 'click', '#overlay', function() { alert( 'hello' ); }); <-- Not working.
[05:06:31] <Cork> FernandoBasso: do you have more then one element with the overlay id?
[05:06:37] <seutje> FernandoBasso: cool
[05:06:46] <FernandoBasso> Cork: Nope.
[05:06:56] <Cork> FernandoBasso: should work then
[05:07:09] <seutje> I can think of a million situations where that wouldn't work
[05:07:42] <Cork> and about the plugin dn't know i would have to read it to say
[05:07:55] <FernandoBasso> This is my script: https://gist.github.com/FernandoBasso/8918338
[05:08:19] <Cork> FernandoBasso: your not waiting for ready
[05:08:27] <Cork> do you don't know that body exists
[05:08:35] <FernandoBasso> I am including it the line before </body>
[05:08:41] <Cork> ah
[05:09:03] <FernandoBasso> The first part of the script works. Just the click on #overlay does not.
[05:09:11] <Cork> FernandoBasso: would say you should write a fiddle
[05:11:02] <seutje> cnr http://jsfiddle.net/z38AR/1/
[05:11:23] <decx> markg85 sorry i had to do some actual work ;) calling $('.lightbox').easybox() after including new elements in the page works for me
[05:11:45] <seutje> if ( menuLat.css( 'right' ) === '-250px' ) {menuLat.animate( { right: '-250px' }, 500 );} <- this doesn't actually do anything, does it?
[05:12:02] <seutje> "if it's at -250px, move it to -250px"? o.O
[05:12:26] <markg85> decx: Where did you add that? Directly after the prepend(...) function?
[05:12:58] <markg85> decx: ah yes
[05:13:03] <markg85> it works now :D
[05:13:18] <decx> after your .before(trailerData)
[05:13:44] <markg85> decx: thanks, working now (i had it after the loop last time i tried).
[05:13:54] <markg85> decx: So, should i consider this a bug and report it?
[05:14:12] <decx> no that's expected behaviour
[05:14:50] <Cork> seutje: he might mean to do +=250 or something?
[05:15:12] <markg85> decx: i wasn't expecting it ;)
[05:23:55] <seutje> Cork: well it would explain "not working"
[05:24:13] <seutje> as in "it does work, just doesn't change anything"
[05:24:35] <decx> .css("width", "+=50") a bit confusing
[05:24:40] <decx> i always found*
[05:24:48] <decx> good lord where did the first part of my line go :o
[05:25:02] <seutje> I suspect /dev/null :P
[05:25:10] <decx> i suspect gremlins
[05:26:09] <decx> "+=n" just looks wrong
[05:26:59] <Cork> :)
[05:27:06] <Cork> ya, i agree
[05:31:41] <xqo> now that <section> exists, when should you use DIV and when should you use SECTION?
[05:32:16] <Cork> xqo: section should be to define a section of the page
[05:32:24] <Cork> while div is a more generic element
[05:32:48] <decx> fyi, body is a section as well
[05:32:58] <xqo> <section id="links">
[05:33:01] <xqo> <section id="footer">
[05:33:06] <xqo> <section id="bodytext">
[05:33:08] <xqo> ?
[05:33:12] <Cork> kinda
[05:33:19] <Cork> bodytext should prob be <main> now days
[05:33:25] <xqo> !!
[05:33:42] <Cork> and #footer should be <footer>
[05:34:01] <xqo> thx, i did not know main exists!
[05:34:01] <Cork> #links should prob be <aside>?
[05:34:09] <decx> but every section can have its own header and footer and aside as well
[05:34:31] <Cork> possibly <nav>
[05:34:53] <Cork> xqo: just think of it as the tag name should explain what the content is
[05:34:56] <decx> just dont forget the shiv or your styles are going to be messed up in ie7
[05:35:08] <Cork> and if it doesn't match what it is; you most likely shouldn't use it for it
[05:35:16] <decx> if you apply them involving the new tags
[05:35:16] <xqo> decx shiv?
[05:35:27] <Cork> like <section class="slider"></section>
[05:36:13] <decx> i thought about using <article></article> for a productpage, but then i went with about 5000 itemscope attributes
[05:36:16] <Cork> xqo: document.createElement('new tag name ie7 doesn't know about')
[05:36:35] <Cork> it needs to run in a js file for you to be able to style them
[05:36:45] <Cork> but only ie7
[05:36:50] <Cork> ie8 just needs some css
[05:36:55] <decx> xqo a shiv/shim/polyfill adds functionality to older browsers
[05:37:19] <Cork> decx: this doesn't really add functionality like normal shims though
[05:37:25] <decx> i guess a shim would sanitize input
[05:37:26] <decx> right
[05:37:30] <Cork> and actually isn't a polyfill at all
[05:37:45] <decx> the 3 are similar is what i'm saying cmon ;)
[05:37:50] <Cork> you just call a function on the dom to make the browser know about the dom element
[05:37:56] <Cork> you don't add any functionality at all
[05:38:17] <Cork> decx: ya, and none of them really describe what you need to do in ie7
[05:38:31] <Cork> and honestly, i don't think you need to care about ie7
[05:38:42] <decx> if you do ecommerce you have to
[05:38:52] <Cork> most users moved quickly from ie7 to ie8 as ie7 has horrible performance
[05:39:09] <Cork> decx: they mostly stayed on ie6
[05:39:20] <decx> might be just 0.5% but those 3 users have 2x conversion rates ;)
[05:39:30] <Cork> it was just one year for them to release ie8 after ie7
[05:39:36] <Cork> while ie6 lived for ~10 years
[05:39:50] <Cork> decx: not really
[05:40:07] <Cork> if you really care you should aim more on supporting ie6
[05:40:13] <Cork> it has more market then ie7
[05:40:20] <Cork> (and most don't care about either)
[05:40:28] <decx> that all depends on what your analytics say
[05:40:40] <Cork> i would say ie8+ is a good start ie9 if your stats grant it
[05:40:44] <Cork> ya
[05:41:14] <decx> but yeah, i normally target from ie8 up
[05:41:37] <decx> and ie7 support costs extra ;)
[05:41:45] <Cork> i normally just bolt ie on after i've developed for sane browsers :)
[05:41:53] <decx> and for ie6 support i want hookers
[05:41:55] <Cork> sane includes ie10+ though
[05:42:49] <hellothere> oh ie 10 is not sane.. try going ie8 mode in ie10 and the browser on its own is saying "i cannot produce that"
[05:43:06] <Cork> hellothere: well if you go ie8 you arn't using ie10
[05:43:13] <Cork> that is kinda the point
[05:43:26] <decx> as long as pixel perfection is no requirement it's not that bad
[05:43:47] <decx> pixel perfection is a myth anyway :p
[05:43:49] <Cork> ie7 and ie8 can be a real pain ya
[05:43:55] <Cork> even without pixel perfect
[05:44:09] <Cork> just cause they are so far behind
[05:44:44] <Cork> you basicallty need to reimplement large parts of css3 to support them (border-radious, transform, gradients and so on)
[05:44:58] <hellothere> well u need to be able to view ur site as ie8 or 7 if u want to debug hard
[05:45:00] <hellothere> :)
[05:45:05] <hellothere> i just hate microsoft in any means
[05:45:11] <hellothere> i dont get how people are still using IE
[05:45:11] <Cork> those result in major look changes so ya,,,
[05:45:23] <hellothere> i dont get why people still using Windows... Servers
[05:45:32] <Cork> hellothere: many don't even know of alternatives
[05:45:46] <Cork> heck many don't even know what a browser is
[05:45:56] <Cork> they are just "using internet"
[05:46:05] <hellothere> yes thats part true, well i think its banks fault
[05:46:06] <hellothere> and IE6
[05:46:13] <hellothere> and IT teams working in corps
[05:46:38] <Cork> well ya activex has caused a lot of problems
[05:46:42] <hellothere> so the IT team of a Corp wont upgrade from IE6 cause they keep using shitty developed things on that
[05:47:05] <Cork> they developed sites that used activex that isn't supported in ie7+
[05:47:12] <hellothere> and also people in those corps never have admin rights to download a new browser
[05:47:20] <Cork> ya
[05:47:39] <Cork> and some even have execution restrictions so they can't even run other applications
[05:47:48] <hellothere> ye i know thats why i am saying about ie6 but i think a lot of banks etc moved to ie8 but still the IT people cannot be hassled into changing to something else or upgrading
[05:48:05] <hellothere> i mostly run shims
[05:48:14] <Cork> most of those sites moved to java as far as i know
[05:48:24] <hellothere> but on my own website, i just have a check so i disallow IE users to join
[05:48:42] <hellothere> end of story, redirecting them to download chrome, Opera, firefox
[05:48:43] <hellothere> :D
[05:48:46] <Cork> hellothere: shouldn't really do that
[05:48:57] <Cork> display a message "your browser can't render this site correctly"
[05:48:58] <hellothere> well its my own site, my rules xD
[05:49:01] <Cork> and let them do what they want
[05:49:10] <decx> if you dont want to sell stuff that's fine
[05:49:14] <Cork> as they can still access the data they need if you do that
[05:49:24] <decx> ie users are converting much easier
[05:49:31] <hellothere> well i guess my site is focused in gaming etc... so u know 99% of my userbase never used IE
[05:49:35] <Cork> decx: well after microsofts fight ie6 is mostely dead now
[05:49:47] <decx> i just mean from a metrics standpoint
[05:50:00] <Cork> and in ~20 days -ie9 will hopefully go the same way
[05:50:19] <decx> i can see ie users having at least .5% better conversion rates on all the ecommerce sites i work on
[05:50:36] <hellothere> my site has to do with Gaming - Emulation etc... so people around it are familiar with computers
[05:50:51] <decx> i'm not going to say: gullible idiots buy more stuff, but yeah, that's what i'm saying ;)
[05:50:52] <Cork> ya, the audience matters
[05:51:13] <Cork> if the site is used on a server matters a lot too (most don't install a browser there so => ie)
[05:51:50] <decx> imagine having to build a page that focuses on the asian market
[05:51:52] <hellothere> well its a well known site and i have a good income from it xD
[05:51:58] <decx> they have their own ie6
[05:52:01] <hellothere> but i aint the only one managing it
[05:52:02] <decx> and it's big
[05:52:15] <hellothere> and i have written it in the best language out there = python xd
[05:54:07] <hellothere> i hate php, well i dont hate it but innefficient, c# just creates sooooo many things during a load of a page that just useless
[05:54:17] <hellothere> so now i am thinking of migrating my stuff though to Jquery
[05:54:23] <hellothere> pure Jquery site
[05:54:28] <hellothere> connected to the api
[05:54:30] <hellothere> and its done :)
[05:54:37] <decx> don't bother if you value seo
[05:54:59] <decx> it's a pain to maintain a content based site with a clientside heavy structure
[05:55:28] <decx> gotta serve pseudo pages to crawlers, and if they differ too much you get penalized
[05:56:20] <hellothere> well its more complicated that that actually
[05:56:27] <hellothere> i am already using powerfull ceo tools
[05:56:47] <hellothere> and serverside i got tags and archivers that check any move a user makes
[05:56:56] <decx> yeah, point is: it's not all smiles and sunshine in the client side world ;)
[05:57:33] <hellothere> well i dunno about that actually, of course its not gonna be 100% client but at least 70% of it
[05:57:52] <hellothere> i am not writting the JS part of it, got 2 devs for that that they are experts on that side of things
[05:58:21] <hellothere> its just going to be nice since i got caching on my api
[05:58:34] <hellothere> so loads etc will be very very quick
[05:58:51] <hellothere> i was also thinking of having a temporary database that caches new posts etc
[05:59:01] <hellothere> and then sends it to my graph Db
[05:59:09] <hellothere> with a delay of 10mins
[06:00:29] <seutje> it's really hard to maintain sanity in a complex frontend if you're not using some sort of structuring framework
[06:02:51] <hellothere> ye of course its goign to be using a framework
[06:03:00] <hellothere> well its not complex the way it has been designed
[06:03:29] <hellothere> graph -> rediss -> api -> serverside code -> frontend code
[06:04:09] <hellothere> thats how it works right now, but ill just move  the server side to the frotnend since the api is handling most of the serverside stuff nowadays
[06:13:46] <bristleback> if I have a variable in $(document).ready(), how can I access it from browser's console?
[06:13:59] <Cork> bristleback: you can't directly
[06:14:08] <Cork> you can export it from the scope of the ready callback
[06:14:22] <Cork> window.global_variable = local_variable
[06:14:49] <decx> or just take away the var, but for testing purposes only ^^
[06:15:09] <seutje> if it's for debugging purposes, you can use a "debugger;" statement to halt execution and then you can run things from the console in the scope of the breakpoint
[06:15:20] <Cork> decx: that isn't guaranteed to work
[06:15:29] <decx> true, it's ugly anyway
[06:15:38] <seutje> doesn't "use strict" error out on that?
[06:15:44] <Cork> decx: not only that; it might littealy not work
[06:15:45] <Cork> ya
[06:15:54] <seutje> it's how I check if my coworkers are leaking :D
[06:16:03] <decx> ehehee
[06:16:15] <Cork> well i use use strict all over the place
[06:16:25] <Cork> so you can't use none strict on the site
[06:17:09] <Cork> decx: http://jsfiddle.net/3rNv3/
[06:17:57] <Cork> on the other hand the site runs under csp here
[06:18:03] <Cork> so you can't even write inline scripts :)
[06:18:11] <seutje> sure u can, just create a new functional scope
[06:18:12] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/KGDkC/
[06:18:43] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/KGDkC/1/
[06:18:59] <Cork> seutje: if use strict is the first thing that happens in all js files
[06:19:05] <Cork> you are kinda limited :)
[06:19:07] <zulcc> I'm just using toggle() but i get fancy animations per default? What's going on?
[06:19:11] <seutje> oh, I thought it had to be bound to a functional scope
[06:19:16] <Cork> the minifiers first line adds "use strict"; :D
[06:19:30] <seutje> we use a lot of third-party tripe though
[06:19:48] <seutje> pretty much guaranteed there's something that's not designed to ever run on strict
[06:19:53] <Cork> ya, and the first i do when i import one of those is fix them so they can work in strict
[06:20:48] <Cork> i even have a suggestion laying around for standardisation where you can set a header "this sit is strict js"
[06:23:24] <zulcc> $(this).toggle() is all I do and it disappears with a swoosh animation to the top left corner
[06:24:36] <zulcc> $(this).toggle(function() { ... });
[06:25:08] <zulcc> is this in some mysterious way not a legit way of using that callback?
[06:25:52] <tubiz> Pls what is the easiest way to learn jQuery
[06:26:19] <bristleback> Cork: thanks
[06:26:52] <Cork> tubiz: https://learn.jquery.com/   http://jqfundamentals.com/1
[06:27:03] <Cork> opps * http://jqfundamentals.com/
[06:27:36] <tubiz> Ok Cork
[06:30:35] <zulcc> Why do i get fancy animations on the menus: http://dpaste.com/1646424/
[06:31:18] <Cork> do you seriously expect us to parse and tell you what happens from the code?
[06:31:31] <decx> i'm gonna blame jquery ui ^^
[06:31:53] <zulcc> I mean, there is no indication of any animation in there, only toggle()...
[06:31:59] <gambitrex> hello! Off topic ultra dummy question. I am wondering. What's the "magic" behind Facebook chat bar. I know very well how it works on background (ajax calls and so), but how (and why) it seems like it's not redrawed on refresh/pages browsing?
[06:32:12] <zulcc> decx: oooh!
[06:32:52] <gambitrex> I mean, when you go to (and from) your profile to your Home feed, seems like the bar wasn't even redrawed!
[06:33:04] <Cork> zulcc: you have a few slideToggle, it migth be the cause
[06:33:18] <Cork> but ya, it isn't possible to tell from the dead code what your seeing
[06:33:26] <zulcc> Cork: I though I only had them in the #footer actions
[06:33:38] <gambitrex> I am make a bar on my website, but it *feels* like it is redrawed every page load. Facebook don't.
[06:33:43] <zulcc> Cork: I get the animation on the menu stuff
[06:33:57] <Cork> zulcc: you have a string of text
[06:34:07] <Cork> no html, not css and it isn't running
[06:34:17] <Cork> you can't expect us to parse that into animations
[06:34:50] <BillCriswell> gambitrex: Al facebook does it use position fixed.
[06:34:54] <Cork> zulcc: if you want to have us look at the effects you need to make a running example in jsfiddle or jsbin
[06:35:01] <BillCriswell> Your other HTML could be insane and just causing tons of issues.
[06:35:35] <zulcc> Okay
[06:37:32] <gambitrex> BillCriswell: I don't get it. How position fixed makes it feel like it does not get "redrawed" at every page load?
[06:38:42] <zulcc> decx: How do i explicitly use jquery's and not jquery-ui's toggle()?
[06:39:13] <decx> if you don'T add arguments it doesn'T matter, you've got some funk somewhere else
[06:39:40] <decx> look at those majestic Ts, i need a new keyboard. dat shift delay
[06:43:40] <decx> oh i'm in a new ab/test for youtube
[06:43:58] <decx> still no grid on the subscription page, go to hell youtube
[06:44:16] <decx> youtube center ftw
[06:44:29] <gambitrex> oh just got the answer. those clever ones. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8819759/how-did-facebook-implement-the-chat-sidebar
[06:45:00] <decx> oh that? yeah they dont actually reload the page
[06:45:18] <BillCriswell> gambitrex: I thought you were talking about the fixed blue bar at the top.
[06:48:42] <gambitrex> I am wondering. What lead them to do this (dont reload the page, update only onle element with whole "page" data). The code complexity is certain bigger, right?
[06:49:21] <gambitrex> BillCriswell: yeah, sorry, english is not my native language, so I can be hard to understand sometimes. :)
[06:50:19] <decx> advertisement speech: With jquery, it's as complex as you want it to be. Want to update a container? Just use $('#mycontainer').load('newpage.html'); want more control? Dive into $.ajax()
[06:50:28] <decx> But wait... there's more
[06:50:47] <decx> order now and get 3 jquery for only 19.95
[06:51:06] <Jattenalle> decx, do you take cashiers check!?
[06:51:18] <decx> that or your firstborn will do
[06:51:30] <Jattenalle> i'll take 5! it's just too good of a deal! :D
[06:51:47] <Jattenalle> and you never know when you'll need 15 copies of jquery
[06:52:01] <decx> 5x$$$ ...literally
[06:53:15] <BillCriswell> gambitrex: That's unfortunate because I even have trouble understanding people who speak it natively. Selective reading I guess.
[06:57:22] <gambitrex> BillCriswell: lol
[07:09:36] <Vivekananda> okay back around
[07:09:59] <Vivekananda> so I was curious of whta are the mobile ways of creating stuff. Advice please
[07:11:07] <cannap> hi any know the plugin jquery validate? http://laravel.io/bin/nyrW i get "false" from the json reponse but validation is not working? all other fields works
[07:12:06] <cannap> other validation like number:true works for this field http://cl.ly/image/3h0S2S1j3B2S
[07:12:10] <cannap> only the remote thing not
[07:12:27] <cannap> the true comes then works but false is ignored dont know thy
[07:20:48] <ryannielson> Not sure if this is the place, but I'll give it a shot. I have a page that has a dropdown that when changes adds some input boxes depending on what was chosen. Thing is, if I leave this page and the user gets back to it using the back button, it doesn't restore the correct amount of input boxes, but the select box still has the same selection. Is there any way to fix this? Document ready doesn't seem to run.
[07:22:02] <bristleback> is there an easy way to put serialized data back into a form?
[07:22:43] <BillCriswell>  bristleback: I wrote something to do that, let me see if I can find it.
[07:22:52] <bristleback> thanks
[07:24:16] <BillCriswell> bristleback: Found it: https://gist.github.com/crswll/7905125
[07:24:30] <bristleback> thanks
[07:25:05] <BillCriswell> populate( $('.formToPopulate'), $('.someForm').serializedArray() );
[07:25:12] <BillCriswell> I should make that into a plugin.
[07:25:18] <decx> how does that deal with serialized selects?
[07:25:36] <decx> does :input work there?
[07:25:41] <BillCriswell> decx: Yes.
[07:25:46] <decx> huh
[07:25:52] <decx> ok then ^^
[07:26:04] <decx> til
[07:26:07] <MariusIT> can i please have an alternative to "$(this).parent().parent().parent().next('.article-list').find('.share-buttons');" ?
[07:26:42] <decx> closest('stuf).next()
[07:28:00] <BillCriswell> If this is in an article list then $(this).closest('.article-list').next('.article-list')
[07:28:14] <BillCriswell> The selector I passed to next is probably useless.
[07:28:19] <MariusIT> decx: just in case i'm n00b http://jsfiddle.net/a5XAh/ :P
[07:28:51] <decx> share-buttons is probably not next to .article-list
[07:29:27] <BillCriswell> It's amazing how much good class names can help.
[07:29:35] <MariusIT> i'm confused :(
[07:29:36] <BillCriswell> with debugging peoples code.
[07:31:36] <decx> it's hard to tell without the markup MariusIT
[07:31:40] <BillCriswell> You want the next articles share button right?
[07:31:58] <MariusIT> the next share-button class in articles-list
[07:32:08] <MariusIT> let me see what i can do for a markup
[07:33:55] <decx> MariusIT like this maybe? http://jsfiddle.net/decx/a5XAh/2/
[07:35:41] <BillCriswell> MariusIT: .closest() gets the closest ancestor.
[07:35:53] <MariusIT> more like this http://jsfiddle.net/a5XAh/4/
[07:36:17] <ph88> does someone know how i can check if this script is loaded ?  http://cdn.jsdelivr.net/tinymce/4.0.1/tinymce.min.js
[07:36:53] <phelix> is it possible to select an area with jquery like you would with css? like $('fieldset.parent-fieldset a.fieldset-title').click(function(e) { ?
[07:37:02] <ph88> sorry i already found it :|
[07:37:04] <ph88> suddenly
[07:37:11] <decx> MariusIT that would be $(this).closest('ul').next('.article-list').find('.share-buttons')
[07:37:23] <phelix> there are lots of a.fieldset-title's on the page. but I want to select only the one inside the fieldset.parent-fieldset container
[07:37:35] <MariusIT> http://jsfiddle.net/a5XAh/5/
[07:37:47] <MariusIT> forot that heading-main repeats itself
[07:40:04] <MariusIT> cleaned up the markup http://jsfiddle.net/a5XAh/7/
[07:40:08] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/a5XAh/9/ MariusITThis is what I thought you wanted?
[07:41:23] <MariusIT> no bill, just an alternative to the commented code http://jsfiddle.net/a5XAh/10/
[07:41:28] <decx> it's early for you so i'll allow this slip ;)
[07:42:14] <MariusIT> reproducing the actual page it's a nightmare :(
[07:42:29] <BillCriswell> MariusIT: I Think that's what I gave you.
[07:43:03] <decx> MariusIT http://jsfiddle.net/decx/a5XAh/11/
[07:43:07] <BillCriswell> Oh wait.
[07:43:33] <BillCriswell> Eh.
[07:43:49] <decx> just use a button instead of anchors though, it's just a button and not a link so why not use a button
[07:43:59] <decx> i mean it's called button
[07:44:10] <Cork> decx++
[07:45:14] <MariusIT> decx, got multiple tags like this share and some of them are links
[07:45:28] <MariusIT> i'm trying to generalize everything
[07:46:21] <MariusIT> decx: thanks for the script, i probably missed something when moving the actual page to jsfiddle http://pastebin.com/CECsxEZg
[07:47:06] <decx> i like the not(target) that's pretty sweet
[07:47:59] <MariusIT> :P
[07:48:01] <MariusIT> workaround
[07:48:21] <MariusIT> idk if closest('ul') will work tough
[07:48:45] <MariusIT> if closest searches tru ancestors should be ok
[07:48:48] <decx> closest just goes up the treee until it hits something
[07:49:24] <MariusIT> ah, then it needs to go up one more level, becouse article-list it's next to ul
[07:49:58] <decx> no
[07:50:35] <decx> closest('.heading-main').next() would be the other heading-main
[07:51:06] <Sendoushi> tough question: do any of you know a repo / plugin of some sorts that ables you to edit a pdf and save under a new name? of course that the tough stuff here is the edit.
[07:52:55] <decx> http://parall.ax/products/jspdf
[07:53:22] <decx> i don't know about editing existing pdf for js though. only php
[07:53:44] <MariusIT> decx: hmm, var target = $(this).closest('ul').next('.article-list').find('.share-buttons'); won't work as article-list is next to ul not in it
[07:54:09] <decx> next() doesnt look inside the element
[07:54:13] <decx> but after it
[07:54:25] <MariusIT> then why dosen't it work, arggggg
[07:54:39] <decx> works in the fiddle so your mistake is somewhere else
[07:55:23] <decx> do you have that stuff in your onload function (document.ready, $(function() {}) etc)
[07:55:26] <MariusIT> i'm stupid
[07:55:31] <MariusIT> ul has another conainer
[07:55:37] <MariusIT> heading-main ...
[07:55:47] <MariusIT> ofc that won't work
[07:56:35] <decx> that makes more sense so it's <div heading-main>stuff&ul&clicker</div><div article-main>socialbuttons...</div>
[07:57:11] <MariusIT> allmost
[07:57:45] <MariusIT> <div heading-main> stuff ul and clicker </div> <article-list> social buttons ... </div>
[07:58:09] <decx> that's what i wrote :o
[07:58:10] <MariusIT> nvm, scratch that line
[07:58:16] <MariusIT> missread, sry
[07:58:37] <MariusIT> so yea, that's the structure
[08:00:29] <MariusIT> idk why, but $(this).parent().parent().parent().next('.article-list').find('.share-buttons'); != $(this).closest('heading-main').next('.article-list').find('.share-buttons');
[08:00:52] <decx> closest('.heading-main')
[08:00:59] <decx> note the . that marks a class
[08:01:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how do you remove all these css warnings in firebug?
[08:01:47] <MariusIT> decx: slap me pls, can't belive i failed that .
[08:02:00] <MariusIT> decx: works fine, thanks for the help
[08:02:02] <decx> console little arrow, untick show css errors ecky--ptang-zoob
[08:02:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and it shows also warnings from the real jquery library...
[08:03:03] <decx> strict warnings maybe?
[08:03:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> This: SyntaxError: Using //@ to indicate sourceMappingURL pragmas is deprecated. Use //# instead
[08:03:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> And: Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated. Use defaultPrevented instead.
[08:03:50] <decx> i only have javascript errors, xmlhttpreq, network errors active
[08:04:32] <decx> ye that's a warning
[08:04:43] <decx> fuck warnings ;)
[08:06:12] <ecky--ptang-zoob> you turn off javascript warnings?
[08:06:55] <decx> well i don't want to see Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated. Use defaultPrevented instead. all the time so yes
[08:07:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> and this also keeps popping up: Warning: Enabling the Script panel causes a Firefox slow-down due to a platform bug. This will be fixed with the next major Firefox and Firebug versions.
[08:07:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> very annoying
[08:07:59] <decx> i love firebug but the script tab is shit
[08:08:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> that shows in the console
[08:10:47] <ecky--ptang-zoob> how to get rid of that? Drives me insane
[08:15:26] <Xal_> when you use css() to change the cursor, does "default" refer to the pointer/arrow cursor, or does it refer to whatever cursor any given element is supposed to display?
[08:16:24] <BillCriswell> Xal_: The pointer/arrow
[08:16:37] <BillCriswell> You'd want auto for the second thingie you described.
[08:16:40] <BillCriswell> I hate words.
[08:16:48] <Xal_> That's what I was looking for. Thanks.
[08:17:28] <BillCriswell> Xal_: I use http://devdocs.io/
[08:17:39] <Xal_> I'm making an ajax call. Before I make the call, I'm setting $("*").css("cursor", "wait");.  I just needed to know how to set everything back in "complete"
[08:17:59] <BillCriswell> Xal_: Ooo that sounds messy.
[08:18:40] <BillCriswell> How about a transparent div 100% width and height over everything?
[08:19:49] <Xal_> I thought of that. I've used it elsewhere, too. Semitransparent, actually with a little loading graphic in the middle.
[08:19:59] <BillCriswell> Yar.
[08:20:29] <Xal_> This function is pretty fast, though. Only takes a fraction of a second.
[08:22:36] <Xal_> Ok, it didn't work right. After the call, I get the text/bar cursor instead of the hand when I hover over links.
[08:23:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does jQuery load() work without a server?
[08:23:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> pure client side?
[08:23:47] <BillCriswell> Xal_: That stinks.
[08:23:55] <BillCriswell> Also kind of weir.d
[08:24:12] <naeluhNSA> damn the daily show is the shit !
[08:24:12] <Xal_> javascript doesn't have access to any files on the client's machine.
[08:25:15] <BillCriswell> Xal_: http://jsbin.com/waxivege/2/edit this is what I was thinking.
[08:27:33] <Xal_> That might work better anyway. Thanks.
[08:28:32] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[08:34:45] <d0de> is there something similar to the html5 audio "canplaythrough" event that I can query at any time, if you know what I mean?
[08:35:14] <d0de> as in something like if ( canplaythrough == "yes") { stuff(); });
[08:43:48] <alainus> d0de, you can probably test that sort of thing
[08:44:40] <alainus> myVid=document.getElementById("video1"); myVid.oncanplaythrough=alert("can play through");
[08:45:24] <Xal_> Ok, got that working. Different question. In the ajax function, how can I pass an arbitrary value into the error handler?
[08:45:31] <Xal_> error callback, rather.
[08:47:14] <Xal_> The function that calls ajax() is, itself, triggered by clicking a checkbox. The checkbox is passing a reference to itself into that function. I want to pass that reference into the error callback.
[08:47:23] <d0de> alainus, will test, ty
[08:47:44] <duch_kazatel> Xal_ do you have some sample code to chare?
[08:47:47] <duch_kazatel> *share
[08:48:47] <Xal_> http://pastebin.com/LMMr5buE
[08:50:14] <duch_kazatel> you'll have to pass it inside of success: function () { /* your function + args here */ }
[08:51:03] <Xal_> I don't think they need the same parameters, do they?
[08:51:53] <Xal_> I'm not sure I understand
[08:51:55] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean?  if you specify an arg in that anonymous function, it'll be whatever the resultset was
[08:52:03] <duch_kazatel> *returned data, rather.
[08:52:12] <Xal_> there is no return data
[08:52:51] <decx> $("*").css("cursor", "wait"); :o
[08:53:00] <decx> that is so expensive
[08:53:13] <duch_kazatel> actually, there is returned data :) it's the response from the server.
[08:53:23] <Xal_> Yeah, I mostly do backend. I don't do a lot of UI
[08:53:25] <duch_kazatel> if you want custom args, you need to do it within that anonymous function.
[08:54:48] <alexut> can someone help, why is the rowElement not getting triggered ? http://pastebin.com/riJFimsZ, if i move it outside the function it  is working ok .
[08:56:08] <b0ss_> hi I have this button: <input type="button" id="btn" age="23" /> and I need to pass the value 23 to a jQuery function. How I am supposed to do this ?
[08:56:19] <duch_kazatel> b0ss_ that's not a valid attribute
[08:56:29] <duch_kazatel> b0ss_ you cannot create your own random attributes like that.
[08:56:37] <b0ss_> duch_kazatel: any work-around ?
[08:56:40] <duch_kazatel> b0ss_ if you prepend it with data-, then it's valid.
[08:57:02] <decx> alexut .fadeOut().remove() doesn'T work like that, you have to put remove in the fadeOut callback
[08:57:30] <duch_kazatel> <input type="button" id="btn" data-age="23" />, and then access it with $('#btn').data('age');
[08:58:09] <aitiba> hi
[08:58:22] <aitiba> how can I read this json " {"12":"Playstation 1","17":"Xbox one"} " with jquery?
[08:58:36] <duch_kazatel> aitiba like you would any other object.
[08:59:11] <duch_kazatel> aitiba you don't need jquery to "read json"
[08:59:39] <aitiba> duch_kazatel: I do a jQuery.each but I get the same item two times
[08:59:46] <b0ss_> duch_kazatel: what if I don't have an id but just the class like this:     <input type="button" class="my-btn" data-age="23" />      ???
[08:59:56] <duch_kazatel> aitiba no need to use each.
[09:00:28] <aitiba> if I dont need each what I need? duch_kazatel
[09:01:15] <duch_kazatel> aitiba a for look.
[09:01:19] <duch_kazatel> *for loop
[09:01:31] <duch_kazatel> b0ss_ you could do either .my-btn instead of that ID.
[09:02:18] <b0ss_> like this     var age = $('.my-btn').data('age')            ???
[09:02:38] <duch_kazatel> b0ss_ sure.
[09:02:42] <duch_kazatel> b0ss_ did you try :)
[09:03:01] <b0ss_> duch_kazatel: yeah and it didn't work
[09:03:08] <duch_kazatel> aitiba http://jsfiddle.net/WkJW9/
[09:03:37] <duch_kazatel> b0ss_ share your code.
[09:04:41] <duch_kazatel> b0ss_ because it works: http://jsfiddle.net/JtA7p/
[09:05:12] <aitiba> duch_kazatel: thanks! and how can I get the id?
[09:05:43] <duch_kazatel> aitiba what did you try?
[09:05:52] <duch_kazatel> because it should be pretty obvious ;)
[09:06:54] <aitiba> I would like to get  12 and 17 of this json " {"12":"Playstation 1","17":"Xbox one"} ". With the code that you send me I can get the name
[09:07:09] <duch_kazatel> aitiba ... what did you try?
[09:07:16] <duch_kazatel> aitiba it's very simple.
[09:07:25] <duch_kazatel> aitiba i want to see if you even tried.
[09:08:04] <aitiba> I try for (var second_category in id=>data) { error
[09:08:13] <duch_kazatel> aitiba http://jsfiddle.net/WkJW9/1/
[09:08:56] <decx> ah. they old "how do i get the key bro" problem ^^
[09:09:07] <duch_kazatel> :)
[09:09:10] <duch_kazatel> it's pretty easy.
[09:09:17] <b0ss_> duch_kazatel: here it is http://jsfiddle.net/wzqW7/
[09:09:34] <duch_kazatel> aitiba i'd go read up on javascript, objects, and dot vs. square bracket notation.
[09:09:48] <Siecje> which would be the correct way to perform the .on('dateChange') method on the id that match the regex https://dpaste.de/oEoD
[09:10:07] <duch_kazatel> Siecje don't match with regex.
[09:10:11] <duch_kazatel> Siecje add a class to the element instead.
[09:10:14] <Xal_> easier way. give all the checkboxes an id containing the unique value that's getting passed into the function and added to "data", and parse out this.data in the error callback.
[09:10:28] <aitiba> duch_kazatel: thanks
[09:10:42] <duch_kazatel> b0ss_ - http://jsfiddle.net/wzqW7/1/
[09:10:53] <duch_kazatel> it works...
[09:11:05] <decx> ye it's posting painel=painel_27
[09:12:17] <decx> having the same name for the var and the parameterkey is unnecessarily confusing
[09:12:27] <decx> unnecessarily is a hard word :o
[09:12:31] <duch_kazatel> truth.  don't do that.
[09:14:14] <b0ss_> duch_kazatel: I was not able to see what exactly you've changed. Please tell me
[09:14:15] <Siecje> duch the problem is that I am just including some javascript in the source and the div and input is getting generated
[09:14:24] <duch_kazatel> b0ss_ I added jquery to the fiddle
[09:15:11] <nhulea_nsa> USA v Canada ! go merica!
[09:15:11] <duch_kazatel> Siecje are you in control of the side that generates the divs?
[09:16:00] <duch_kazatel> Siecje the bigger problem is that you're doing a bunch of extra work that you should be able to avoid.  start by looking at ways to use event delevation.
[09:17:03] <Siecje> actually there is a class on it but I don't think the .on('changeDate', ... is correct
[09:17:14] <decx> datepicker?
[09:17:18] <Siecje> yeah
[09:17:21] <decx> that's the event
[09:17:27] <ankurk_> Is anyone a member of #php? I need an invitation to join :P
[09:17:56] <Siecje> decx: I'm trying to get the save button to appear on change of the datepicker http://due-dates.herokuapp.com/7/course/8/
[09:17:56] <Siecje> $('#assignment_table .form-control').on('changeDate', function(){ doesn't seem to work
[09:19:46] <Siecje> ankurk_: have you registered your nick?
[09:20:35] <ankurk_> How can I check for that? I am using IRC Cloud if that matters.
[09:20:49] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ have you ever msgd chanserv?
[09:21:16] <decx> Siecje maybe changeDate is just in another datepicker i used because i chcked the datepicker api and it has no events. but change should work as well as it's just an input
[09:21:47] <ankurk_> nope
[09:21:47] <decx> Siecje http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Bn8cD/
[09:21:58] <Siecje> yeah I have
[09:21:58] <Siecje> $('#assignment_table input').change(function() {

[09:26:08] <BillCriswell> nhulea_nsa: Yeah, the "e" is making it look funky.
[09:26:29] <BillCriswell> nhulea_nsa: The flyers do look weird cause they've been terrible lately.

[09:34:12] <duch_kazatel> graphettion also: look into event delegation.  i'll whip up a quick example.
[09:34:15] <graphettion> duch_kazate: http://jsfiddle.net/k9RVh/2/ trying to click the images and display only that text on each one.
[09:34:24] <graphettion> It's not working for me.
[09:34:27] <graphettion> Am I doing something wrong?
[09:34:46] <decx> several things
[09:34:54] <ankurk_> Just registered my nickname.
[09:34:56] <duch_kazatel> graphettion well for starters, #img2 doesn't exist.
[09:34:56] <Siecje> Is there a way to see which events are being fired?
[09:35:16] <graphettion> lol
[09:35:18] <graphettion> True.
[09:35:20] <graphettion> Added it.
[09:35:27] <duch_kazatel> one sec - let me blow your mind.
[09:35:49] <graphettion> Well, I don't want you to do it for me unless you want to. I'm just trying to understand.
[09:36:04] <duch_kazatel> graphettion you're doing it the hard way.
[09:36:31] <graphettion> :/
[09:36:58] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/k9RVh/3/
[09:37:35] <decx> still ugly :>

[09:38:13] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/k9RVh/5/
[09:38:38] <duch_kazatel> even smarter.  if you have a default css thing, don't use jquery.
[09:38:40] <duch_kazatel> use css.
[09:38:49] <decx> you're on a roll duch, if only the damn css completition didnt make your css invalidish
[09:39:03] <duch_kazatel> fuck. http://jsfiddle.net/k9RVh/6/
[09:39:05] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[09:39:34] <duch_kazatel> graphettion even smarter, use data attributes instead of IDs to link stuff together so you aren't parsing the ID like that.
[09:39:43] <duch_kazatel> I'll let you figure out that one :)
[09:39:52] <graphettion> Yeah, I gotcha.
[09:40:01] <graphettion> data attributes
[09:40:29] <Dreagos> Hi, I am using the Jquery Draggable items, and need to find a way to check to see if the place dropped is NOT a droppable item. I have already set the revert option to true, but I can't seem to find a way to check for "Is where I am being placed droppable? If not do this..."
[09:40:35] <duch_kazatel> oh and use jsfiddle like a pro: http://jsfiddle.net/k9RVh/7/
[09:42:33] <Dreagos> Basically, I am looking to bind/unbind draggable objects between drop items and if dragged onto a non drop item, unbind the current binding
[09:43:25] <d0de> I have an app that has 10 sounds that load in the background. Sounds can be "active" or not based on what the user did last time they were there, with the results in localStorage. I want to do something once all the "active" sounds are loaded, ignoring the "inactive" sounds. What kind of approach could I use?
[09:43:55] <d0de> For each sound, I need to test if it's active, then test if it's loaded (inactive sounds never load)
[09:44:16] <decx> duch_kazatel that's one case where native is shorter this.id.slice(-1) instead of $(this).attr('id').replace('img', '')
[09:44:51] <duch_kazatel> hah, decx truth.
[09:47:19] <Dreagos> Guess there isn't such a check :/
[09:48:02] <duch_kazatel> Dreagos there may be, but it might be that nobody here is familiar with the draggable setup.
[09:48:30] <madalin> can someone tell me how i could capture the text in an input and add it to a variable ?
[09:48:58] <duch_kazatel> d0de enumerate through the list to see what should be active.  when done, continue?
[09:50:42] <Dreagos> Quite possible... I don't even see any stack overflow questions regarding this, so it wouldn't be farfetched to assume this. I could simply create an "unbind" button
[09:50:57] <d0de> dutch_kazatel, I think I've worked out a clean way to do it with if statements, the only part I'm missing is, is there a way to do "when foo = 1 && bar = 1 && baz = 1" etc?
[09:51:04] <Dreagos> and put it in the drag item panel
[09:51:16] <duch_kazatel> d0de without seeing some code it's hard to help.
[09:51:38] <Dreagos> Guess that will be my soluton
[09:51:51] <duch_kazatel> Dreagos are you trying to prevent dropping into specific landing zones?
[09:52:11] <d0de> Well, I've worked out how to store the state in a bunch of variables, and have each variable flip from 0 to 1 when either the sound is inactive or the active sound is loaded. All I need now is a way to do something when all the variables are 1
[09:52:14] <Dreagos> No
[09:52:39] <d0de> I could do it with setTimeout but is there a cleaner way?
[09:52:40] <duch_kazatel> d0de create big object to store all that info instead of a bunch of separate variables.
[09:52:48] <duch_kazatel> Dreagos http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5047130/how-to-cancel-a-drop-action-for-jquery-droppable
[09:52:58] <Dreagos> Once an object is dragged onto a drop item, I am setting a property attached to both the drag item and drop item... basically mapping the 2 together
[09:53:18] <duch_kazatel> you're looking to break that mapping?
[09:53:23] <Dreagos> Yes
[09:53:27] <duch_kazatel> weird.  no clue.
[09:53:46] <Dreagos> That's pretty much what I am getting
[09:53:49] <duch_kazatel> d0de aaaah you're waiting on everything to finish loading?
[09:53:53] <d0de> duch, yes
[09:54:02] <duch_kazatel> d0de look into promises.  that's exactly what they're for.
[09:54:11] <d0de> duch_kazatel, thank you, will do
[09:55:34] <tucan> I'm not familiar with this kind of code, what do we call this $( "<ul/>", {
[09:55:34] <tucan> 						
[09:55:47] <duch_kazatel> tucan a jquery object.
[09:56:26] <tucan> is that saying the opening <ul> </ul> is added?
[09:57:05] <decx> /> doesnt matter, $('<tag>') creates that tag
[09:57:09] <duch_kazatel> tucan no.  that creates a fragment with a "self-closing" UL tag, which is basucally <ul></ul>  then you can append to it as wanted.
[09:57:50] <decx> i remember having to put /> for self closing but not anymore, was that updated at some point?
[09:58:13] <tucan> oh it doesnt matter?
[09:58:42] <duch_kazatel> depends on the doctype.
[09:58:51] <duch_kazatel> and it'll confuse the hell out of some folks if you omit it.
[09:59:28] <decx> you can also add attributes without having an unmaintainable mess $('div',{ 'data-stuf : 'value' , 'data-more' : 'val'})
[09:59:45] <duch_kazatel> that syntax has always broken my head.
[10:00:01] <decx> it does
[10:00:15] <decx> but looks better than $('<div 5000 attributes>')
[10:00:25] <duch_kazatel> true.
[10:02:49] <duch_kazatel> decx do you know of any good resources on that syntax?
[10:03:19] <decx> i saw it once somewhere and since then i'm winging it
[10:03:23] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[10:03:40] <decx> life in a nutshell
[10:11:47] <d0de> duch_kazatel, ty for your help, ended up solving it with when(); after all!
[10:11:53] <duch_kazatel> of course :)
[10:14:08] <duch_kazatel> decx hah - https://api.jquery.com/jquery/#jQuery-html-attributes
[10:14:41] <decx> no wonder nobody knows about it, talk about buried
[10:15:28] <duch_kazatel> wow, i really need to read this page.  helloooo friday
[10:15:43] <decx> damn even events can be bound on there
[10:15:57] <decx> dito
[10:20:19] <duch_kazatel> woah selector context?!
[10:20:22] <duch_kazatel> whuddup.
[10:20:36] <tucan> i followed an example in the jquery docs that basically appends a ul to body every time search button is clicked but how can i append it only once unless the search term changed
[10:21:04] <duch_kazatel> tucan by storing the search term and comparing it against the old one.
[10:21:38] <tucan> can i just use onchange or something?
[10:21:54] <duch_kazatel> sure, you could do that, too.
[10:22:00] <decx> i love selector context, find() is too long
[10:22:22] <duch_kazatel> but be aware that "onchange" fires even if the input isn't actually different.
[10:22:40] <duch_kazatel> i could delete two characters and add them back and the "change" will fire.
[10:24:43] <tucan> hmm maybe what i want to achieve is remove the last ul before appending again
[10:24:58] <duch_kazatel> you said you only want to append if data has changed, right?
[10:25:54] <duch_kazatel> brb
[10:26:01] <tucan> i thought thats what i wanted but now it appends a new ul again
[10:27:34] <d0de> duch_kazatel, turns out it's not working after all. I made a fiddle, could you steer me in the right direction? http://jsfiddle.net/Vt6sY/1/
[10:28:52] <duch_kazatel> back
[10:29:41] <duch_kazatel> d0de you need to use promises, which is more than just using .when()
[10:30:08] <duch_kazatel> https://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[10:30:13] <duch_kazatel> this is what you're looking for.
[10:30:13] <d0de> duch, do you know of any relevant promise code? the jquery page on promises seems pretty impenetrable
[10:30:39] <duch_kazatel> d0de I don't have anything at the moment.  this is a good place to start: https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.Deferred/
[10:30:46] <duch_kazatel> there are also TONS of tutorials out there.
[10:30:57] <d0de> ok will look ty
[10:31:46] <duch_kazatel> the idea with deferreds is they're basically managing the chaining for you - they know when everything has resolved and so manage that step.
[10:31:52] <duch_kazatel> a little funky, but a neat way to do async
[10:37:01] <d0de> this is completely impenetrable to me
[10:37:08] <d0de> I think I'm just going to use a setTimeout
[10:37:28] <duch_kazatel> don't use setTimeou
[10:37:30] <duch_kazatel> trust me.
[10:37:37] <duch_kazatel> take the time to do it right.
[10:42:16] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I respect your opinion and your help but I really don't think I'm going to be able to work out how to do this with deferred and promises, I am not able to see the link between the tutorials and what I'm trying to do
[10:42:48] <duch_kazatel> d0de you have audio files that have a variable amount of time for each to load, right?
[10:43:02] <d0de> yes
[10:43:06] <duch_kazatel> http://www.erichynds.com/blog/using-deferreds-in-jquery
[10:43:44] <duch_kazatel> the idea is that each load event fires a “done” - if you let deferreds do their magic, they’ll manage the queue for you.
[10:44:00] <duch_kazatel> using timers is generally a really bad idea.
[10:45:32] <d0de> I don't think the way I'm loading the audio files is compatible with that
[10:45:39] <duch_kazatel> how are you loading them?
[10:46:33] <d0de> by changing the src attribute of the html5 audio player once certain conditions are met, then resetting the player
[10:47:25] <_rgn> pool promises into an array. resolve each of them in whatever signals that a particular file is loaded. then use `all` method that most promise libs have
[10:48:29] <duch_kazatel> http://therockncoder.blogspot.com/2013/11/jquery-deferred-creating-your-own.html
[10:53:01] <d0de> duch_kazatel, I already have ~1300 LoC, I don't think I can face changing the fundamentals now
[10:53:09] <d0de> that article is way beyond my understanding of js
[10:54:59] <d0de> I appreciate your help, but I know too little to do things the way your propose
[10:55:54] <duch_kazatel> d0de then you’re going to push out something bugged =/
[10:56:31] <duch_kazatel> d0de using setTimeout() is a bad idea because you can’t guarantee that things actually happened.
[10:57:45] <d0de> I'm going to use setInterval to check a few times per second if all the relevant audio has returned canplaythrough
[10:58:20] <d0de> I realize it's not perfect
[10:58:37] <duch_kazatel> your code.
[10:58:53] <duch_kazatel> str.trim() and old IE ugh it kills me.
[11:04:00] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I picked up a couple small moleskin notebooks to try them out. I dig it.
[11:04:22] <duch_kazatel> feel the hipster.
[11:04:26] <duch_kazatel> i love them, too.
[11:04:30] <duch_kazatel> i always carry a small one on me.
[11:05:03] <BillCriswell> I like the little pocket on the back.
[11:05:37] <BillCriswell> I'm such a dumbass. For like 10 minutes I was just wondering why .span wasn't targeting a <span>
[11:05:47] <duch_kazatel> haahahaha welcome to friday
[11:06:38] <Crucials|2> Every time I dont write anything for a decent length of time, I do about 100 of those, BillCriswell
[11:06:49] <Crucials|2> .body what
[11:07:05] <duch_kazatel> my favorite is always this one:
[11:07:05] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/75C6m/1/
[11:07:41] <BillCriswell> Crucials|2: HAha.
[11:08:03] <duch_kazatel> me and one other dev helped another try to figure that one out for about 10 minutes once.  the lesson?  don’t newline your opening curlies.
[11:08:22] <Crucials|2> lol duch, i couldnt even see that for a good minute
[11:08:34] <duch_kazatel> right?!
[11:08:40] <Crucials|2> yeah its pretty well hidden
[11:08:44] <Crucials|2> but i always newline my curlies
[11:08:54] <duch_kazatel> :(
[11:08:54] <Crucials|2> otherwise my ADD makes me go crazy
[11:09:03] <decx> savage
[11:09:07] <duch_kazatel> we yell at people for that - open curly goes on same line.
[11:09:25] <duch_kazatel> always.
[11:09:28] <Crucials|2> makes no sense to me... the curlies open and close on the same indentation
[11:09:33] <Crucials|2> makes so much sense!
[11:09:37] <BillCriswell> I JUST saw it.
[11:10:22] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/75C6m/2/
[11:10:25] <duch_kazatel> coimpare
[11:10:42] <BillCriswell> Now I know what I'm looking for.
[11:10:52] <BillCriswell> Spring that up on me one day when I'm not ready for it!
[11:10:52] <Crucials|2> thats not fair
[11:10:57] <Crucials|2> ^
[11:11:05] <Crucials|2> but, i think it would be easier to see this way anyway
[11:11:19] <BillCriswell> Crucials|2: We'll never know.
[11:11:27] <Crucials|2> but the hidden semicolon can't be the only argument for sameline curlies
[11:12:15] <duch_kazatel> it also reads better - visually ties the following block to the preceding statement to me.
[11:15:59] <decx> i just do it because i always did it
[11:16:26] <decx> but i also lowercase everything soooo... whatever ^^
[11:16:46] <duch_kazatel> also tabs vs spaces.
[11:16:53] <Crucials|2> no one does spaces
[11:16:58] <duch_kazatel> orly?
[11:16:58] <Crucials|2> do they?
[11:17:01] <duch_kazatel> yeah, they do.
[11:17:04] <decx> yea
[11:17:04] <duch_kazatel> node.js
[11:17:08] <decx> i dont
[11:17:09] <duch_kazatel> that entire company says spaces.
[11:17:22] <decx> why click two times when i can click once ^^
[11:17:23] <duch_kazatel> i say tabs - you can configure your IDE to display them as wide as you want.
[11:17:43] <Crucials|2> four spaces master race
[11:17:56] <duch_kazatel> decx you can configure the tab key to enter a certain number of spaces.
[11:18:13] <decx> yeah but why go through the hassle
[11:18:22] <duch_kazatel> i know. tabs are better,
[11:18:29] <BillCriswell> I'm a two space kind of guy.
[11:19:14] <duch_kazatel> and now I have read https://api.jquery.com/jquery/ and feel smart.
[11:19:15] <BillCriswell> Tab = 2 Spaces for William!
[11:19:59] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Hm, $($('.foo')) is a clone... didn't think that.
[11:21:15] <duch_kazatel> i knew about the whole document fragment thing, but the rest of it?
[11:22:50] <BillCriswell> $('<div>', { html: 'What', on: { click: function(){ console.log('whooaaa'); } }, "class": "haaaa" });
[11:23:00] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[11:23:00] <BillCriswell> You can really pass anything to that thing.
[11:24:46] <duch_kazatel> it’s beautiful.
[11:25:28] <BillCriswell> Something about it doesn't feel right to me, don't know what it is though.
[11:26:56] <duch_kazatel> probably because we love that $() = a selector?
[11:27:07] <duch_kazatel> and not a beautiful “everything object”
[11:27:57] <decx> such power, much convenience
[11:28:32] <duch_kazatel> so power, many convenience.  wow.
[11:28:33] <decx> i knew about context and attribute but having events as well is nice
[11:28:52] <decx> i think i prefer to power to bind multiple events though
[11:29:07] <decx> or does that work in this syntax as well
[11:29:27] <decx> multipleevents on one function
[11:29:38] <decx> without having to externalize the function
[11:31:39] <BillCriswell> I imagine it passes it to on.
[11:32:54] <duch_kazatel> yeah it probably does.
[11:33:09] <duch_kazatel> to github!
[11:34:28] <BillCriswell> Typing this is weird.
[11:35:06] <BillCriswell> Don't think you could use event delegation with it.
[11:35:20] <duch_kazatel> that’s what I’m looking for :)
[11:35:56] <duch_kazatel> it’s been a while since I’ve looked at the jquery source.
[11:37:54] <BillCriswell> I know you can do $el.on({ click: fn, mouseenter: fn }, '.foo'); but I'm not sure how to do that with the $('<div>', {}); way.
[11:38:37] <duch_kazatel> found it
[11:39:29] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/dYjss/
[11:40:12] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I was wondering about passing it the ".foo" part in that style.
[11:40:36] <duch_kazatel> hrm...
[11:41:12] <BillCriswell> Like for event delegation. Not sure what that argument is calle.d
[11:41:24] <duch_kazatel> yeah it’s the event target.
[11:43:43] <duch_kazatel> this is going to kill me.
[11:44:19] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha.
[11:47:27] <duch_kazatel> i give up.
[11:47:31] <duch_kazatel> but later!
[11:47:45] <ankurk_> So I am adding a button while appending a record to the table but that button doesn't work after I try to click on it after the record has been added. It only works after page refresh. Why it might be happening?
[11:47:51] <decx> but i want the same
[11:47:53] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/dYjss/5/
[11:48:06] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ use event delegation.
[11:50:02] <ankurk_> Ah! So this "$(document).on('click', '.commit_btn', function() " will get changed to "$( document ).delegate( ".commit_btn", "click", function()"?
[11:50:16] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ no - .delegate doesn’t exist.
[11:50:28] <duch_kazatel> but they do basically the same thing.
[11:50:37] <duch_kazatel> but don’t bind to document - bind down loer
[11:50:40] <duch_kazatel> *lower
[11:51:22] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: Like $('.commit_btn').on('click', function(e) ?
[11:51:45] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ that’s not using delegation.  what’s the parent node you’re adding stuff to?
[11:52:01] <decx> got it
[11:52:03] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/decx/dYjss/6/
[11:52:12] <ankurk_> Well I am adding a new row to the table.
[11:52:23] <ankurk_> that new row has two buttons
[11:52:35] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ so $(table).on('click', '.commit_btn', function()
[11:53:07] <duch_kazatel> wait that’s not event delegation though is it?
[11:53:12] <duch_kazatel> *decx, i mean
[11:53:23] <decx> it works
[11:53:31] <duch_kazatel> sure, but it’s not delegating the event.
[11:53:47] <gordian> djam90
[11:53:58] <djam90> hey gordian
[11:54:08] <decx> it's only on that div duch_kazatel
[11:54:28] <duch_kazatel> but can i attach a delegated listener to that div?
[11:54:48] <decx> hm
[11:54:59] <nhulea_nsa> hey how come my array on line 102 is empty ? http://jsfiddle.net/naeluh/mnfKn/7/
[11:55:07] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/dYjss/9/
[11:56:01] <duch_kazatel> nhulea_nsa because resultcache[num] isn’t returning anything.
[11:56:29] <djam90> I think I get event delegation now, it makes sense, if you add elements after your script is run, it won't pick up the new element in the binding
[11:56:35] <nhulea_nsa> duch_kazatel: but it is on line 91
[11:57:22] <nhulea_nsa> it has a ton of objects then once its outside of the function its empty
[11:57:22] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: So I tried this, "$('#project_table').on('click', '.commit_btn', function()". Didn't work :(
[11:58:41] <duch_kazatel> ankurk_ supply some sample code?
[11:58:41] <nhulea_nsa> I think I am having the same issue as before where it is outside of the callback again
[11:59:59] <duch_kazatel> nhulea_nsa do you have your var declaration hoisted properly?
[12:00:20] <ankurk_> Give me a moment
[12:00:34] <duch_kazatel> and with that, i need to go do some more work.
[12:00:38] <duch_kazatel> enjoy folks.
[12:00:42] <nhulea_nsa> I have it at the top     var resultcache = [];
[12:01:03] <d0de> duch_kazatel, thanks for trying to help me out and put me on the right track, I appreciate it
[12:01:03] <nhulea_nsa> duch_kazatel: thanks I am really screwing up this ajax callback business
[12:04:31] <ankurk_> duch_kazatel: I am adding two buttons at the end of the row. Edit works but commit doesn't. https://gist.github.com/pioneersolutions/9142319
[12:13:32] <synth__> let's say i have a selector returning something like <li><i class='my-icon'></i><small>some text here</small><li>; however, not all elements inside of the <li> selector contain the <small> tags. is there a way to modify the "some text here" to be something else without having to itterate through all child elements?
[12:13:53] <duch_kazatel> synth__ what’s the selector?
[12:14:49] <synth__> var preview_item = $("[data-attr='"+attr+"']") so the <li> has the data-attr applied, like: <li data-attr="phone">...child elements...</li>
[12:15:13] <duch_kazatel> then do this: $("li[data-attr='"+attr+"'] small")
[12:15:28] <synth__> but not all li items will have the small tag
[12:15:37] <duch_kazatel> or: $("li[data-attr='"+attr+"']").find(‘small’)
[12:15:41] <duch_kazatel> so?
[12:15:45] <duch_kazatel> that doesn’t make any sense.
[12:15:51] <duch_kazatel> do you know how CSS selectors work?
[12:17:03] <synth__> yes, i understand how they work. i'm just curious if there is a way to modify plain text burried inside of a selector rather than itterating through the children
[12:17:14] <duch_kazatel> wat
[12:17:24] <duch_kazatel> you’re not iterating there.
[12:17:36] <duch_kazatel> well, i mean you kind of are i guess in the background
[12:18:59] <synth__> well, if my li elements have different html tags inside of them, but ultimately they have plain text like say, a phone number or a name or email, i want to access just that text and be able to modify it
[12:19:13] <decx> synth__ http://jsfiddle.net/decx/h22km/
[12:19:29] <decx> something like this maybe
[12:20:12] <duch_kazatel> lol
[12:20:16] <duch_kazatel> you’re an evil bastard
[12:21:17] <duch_kazatel> synth__ what’s your actual concern?
[12:21:58] <decx> hey inflexible markup is a real menace ;)
[12:22:09] <decx> so we have to torture it
[12:22:25] <duch_kazatel> i just don’t get the whole “iterating” thing.  let the browser handle stuff.
[12:22:41] <duch_kazatel> there’s a reason we got querySelectorAll natively.
[12:24:12] <synth__> i have a modify contact information page that updates the fields in our database when the user changes that info in the input. there is a part of the page that shows a "preview" of what that info looks like once updated, however there is different html applied to some of the items that are modifiable. i have it successfully altering the visibility of some of these fields, however, i'm trying
[12:24:13] <synth__> to find a good way to alter the text in these "preview" fields as well.
[12:25:11] <duch_kazatel> by targeting them?  still not sure why basic sizzle isn’t cutting it.
[12:25:36] <synth__> maybe I need to think this through more.
[12:25:40] <synth__> i'm sorry if i bothered.
[12:25:58] <duch_kazatel> you didn’t, but your question seems strange.  why doesn’t my suggestion work?
[12:26:41] <synth__> well, your selector included "small", however, not all of these fields have the <small></small> tags
[12:27:12] <duch_kazatel> that selector ONLY reaches those areas that match that fully, unless you need to target cases that also don’t have the small tag.
[12:30:13] <synth__> i think what i'll do is just wrap text i want to modify in a span, then just use a selector that queries that instead
[12:30:50] <duch_kazatel> synth__ you haven’t really explained what your real concern is.
[12:31:06] <duch_kazatel> is it that not every editable field is wrapped in <small>?
[12:31:53] <synth__> i have said that about three times now. yes, each field has different html around the text i want to modify.
[12:32:47] <duch_kazatel> synth__ sorry, where did you say that?
[12:32:58] <duch_kazatel> and if that’s the case, do the smart thing and add a class to editable fields.
[12:33:00] <synth__> <synth__> well, your selector included "small", however, not all of these fields have the <small></small> tags
[12:33:17] <synth__> yes, that's what i think i'm going to do
[12:33:44] <duch_kazatel> sorry, i wasn’t sure what you meant by “not all of these fields have the <small></small> tags” - I was under the impression you were confused by how sizzle works.
[12:33:46] <duch_kazatel> apologies.
[12:33:53] <synth__> no, it's ok
[12:34:12] <synth__> i could have done a better job with my wording
[12:35:18] <ankurk_> I am such a fool, I was adding a wrong class to the button I was appending dynamically. F***
[12:35:21] <synth__> the selector i have currently would be returning a bunch of different html for each field so i was either going to find a way to do a string replace or wrap the text i want to change in a span or a different class so that i can select based on that, versus returning all of the html inside
[12:35:52] <ankurk_> But I learned something, thanks to duch_kazatel.
[12:36:06] <duch_kazatel> synth__ yeah, in thise case, you should add a class to editable areas imo.
[12:36:08] <duch_kazatel> and target that.
[12:36:23] <synth__> but i agree with you on applying a class for the editable areas, i should have thought of that before
[12:36:26] <synth__> so thank you :)
[12:36:47] <duch_kazatel> of course.  the rest of your logic should fall in line after that.
[12:43:35] <synth__> duch_kazetel -- got it to work :)
[12:45:34] <duch_kazatel> good

[14:43:28] <duch_kazatel> oh :(
[14:43:35] <duch_kazatel> wish i could help >.>
[14:43:39] <wunz> check out line 58 that i commented out, if i use that array, it works
[14:43:45] <razzi> what's a good plugin for a pages menu with drag&drop for a CMS?
[14:43:46] <wunz> but i thikn thats the format that flexigrid accepts it
[14:43:48] <bufferloss> razzi: I doubt there's gonna be a a good "plugin" for that
[14:43:52] <duch_kazatel> nhulea_nsa check to make sure num is defined where you think it is.
[14:43:58] <wunz> so how would i remap my custodians json to match that format?
[14:43:58] <razzi> bufferloss why not?
[14:43:58] <bufferloss> razzi: CSS can do nested drop down menus just fine, no need for javascript
[14:44:10] <bufferloss> razzi: as far as making the menu based on your pages, that is the domain of your server side
[14:44:21] <bufferloss> either the rendering side or the API side, whatever you happen to be using
[14:44:25] <razzi> bufferloss, sorry i meant the pages menu for the admin area of a CMS
[14:44:35] <bufferloss> razz, still the same answer basically
[14:44:46] <duch_kazatel> wunz I’ll bet if you add another column and configure it accordingly, it’ll work better.
[14:44:48] <razzi> no, it isn't
[14:45:04] <bufferloss> er, well yes it is, I'm telling you that my response is still the same
[14:45:11] <wunz> duch_kazatel: care to help? i gave up
[14:45:13] <Es0teric> wunz that didnt work... the problem i am having is that whatever is searched will get appended so .clear() doesnt work
[14:45:15] <bufferloss> it is indeed characteristically a little "different"
[14:45:22] <bufferloss> but it's not a great candidate for plugin reusability
[14:45:29] <razzi> what's a good plugin for a pages menu with drag&drop for admin area of a CMS?
[14:45:34] <duch_kazatel> wunz I can try.  one sec.
[14:46:07] <bufferloss> razzi: I think you may need to clarify further all the things you want this menu to do
[14:46:08] <duch_kazatel> wait wunz what’s the problem again?]
[14:46:10] <bufferloss> razzi, https://jqueryui.com/droppable/
[14:46:22] <wunz> duch_kazatel: it doesn't load my custodians json
[14:46:26] <razzi> it should be nested
[14:46:29] <bufferloss> what are your goals, what is a normal user supposed to be able "to do" with this "drag and drop admin menu"
[14:46:30] <duch_kazatel> okay yeah one sec.
[14:46:42] <bufferloss> razzi: k, nesting really doesn't necessitate a plugin in any way
[14:46:48] <bufferloss> or even imply one
[14:47:06] <razzi> stfu
[14:47:18] <bufferloss> good luck getting help with that attitude
[14:47:27] <wunz> Es0teric: do this: http://jsfiddle.net/WH47L/
[14:47:29] <duch_kazatel> razzi there won’t be any singl e”plguin” to manage all of that.
[14:47:30] <bufferloss> just cuz it's not the answer you want to hear doesn't mean it's not the truth
[14:47:37] <bufferloss> duch_kazatel++
[14:48:02] <bufferloss> lol, good, he left :)
[14:48:08] <wunz> lol, why did that dude get mad?
[14:48:13] <wunz> and who was he cursing @?
[14:48:20] <duch_kazatel> becayse he didn’t hear what he wanted.
[14:48:31] <bufferloss> I have this seemingly effortless ability to make people mad by stating facts
[14:48:33] <wunz> come asking for help like that? shit... i'd ban his ass.
[14:49:07] <bufferloss> lol, I pissed of cbreak in #git yesterday cuz his answer wasn't correct and he still refuses to believe me, I just haven't taken the time to write up a full test case that doesn't include propritary
[14:49:15] <bufferloss> information that I can't release cuz I'm under NDA
[14:49:47] <wunz> i hate the /join/part spams
[14:49:52] <wunz> wish we could move that elsewhere
[14:50:04] <Es0teric> i am seriously starting to hate my mac
[14:50:07] <duch_kazatel> wunz i figured out your first problem.
[14:50:12] <bufferloss> he then proceeded to call me an idiot because he didn't understand my use case and wouldn't take the time to do so, then when I asked him to please politely just leave me alone someone else kicked me
[14:50:13] <wunz> Es0teric: works?
[14:50:17] <wunz> duch_kazatel: what is it?
[14:50:17] <bufferloss> lol, wtf, at least it wasn't a ban anyway
[14:50:18] <duch_kazatel> "NetworkError: 403 Forbidden - http://flexigrid.info/js/flexigrid.pack.js"
[14:50:21] <Es0teric> just give me a freakin PC with Gentoo or Ubuntu
[14:50:26] <bufferloss> wunz: you can usually hide those in most IRC clients
[14:50:37] <Es0teric> wunz give me a sec, my startup disk is full so it wont process the link you gave me on chrome
[14:50:52] <wunz> duch_kazatel: it works...
[14:51:38] <wunz> i don't get that error, neither does jsfiddle
[14:51:39] <Es0teric> wunz can you hold that link while i restart my computer real quick?
[14:51:43] <duch_kazatel> wunz check your console.
[14:51:49] <Es0teric> my bad i am doing this but... shit it has to be done
[14:51:54] <wunz> Es0teric: it'll be inn your backlog
[14:52:01] <Es0teric> wunz backlog?
[14:52:40] <tucan> assuming that var data = [{,"word":"apple","type":"noun","translation":"mela","gender":"f"}];  wouldn't this handlebars template give me  word-translation pairs?  {{#each data}} <li>{{word}} = {{translation}}</li>{{/each}}
[14:52:58] <wunz> duch_kazatel: yea, not important errors there, the fiddle will still work and load the flexigrid
[14:53:02] <tucan> not sure what im doing wrong
[14:53:09] <duch_kazatel> wunz it’s not loading the grid for me.
[14:53:16] <duch_kazatel> wunz i’m getting a 403 error on the javascript.
[14:53:30] <wunz> weird that it works for me
[14:54:11] <duch_kazatel> find alternative hosting maybe?
[14:54:19] <wunz> yea sec
[14:57:09] <phuh> Why isn't global object "window.jQuery" not created in jQuery 2??
[14:57:18] <phuh> Is this renamed to something else?
[14:57:31] <duch_kazatel> phuh there is a global jquery object.
[14:58:21] <phuh> Hmm I tried with "<script src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.0/jquery.js"/>"
[14:58:44] <duch_kazatel> phuh have some sample code?
[14:58:55] <phuh> This is the only line in a static html file
[14:59:37] <duch_kazatel> <script type=”text/javascript” src=”//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.0/jquery.js"/>
[14:59:45] <duch_kazatel> also, how do you know that the object doesn’t exist?
[15:00:11] <snover> script tags are not self-closing
[15:00:15] <snover> <script></script>
[15:00:31] <duch_kazatel> oh yeah that’s right.
[15:00:32] <duch_kazatel> thank you.
[15:00:40] <duch_kazatel> <script type=”text/javascript” src=”//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.0/jquery.js"></script>
[15:02:20] <wunz> duch_kazatel: http://jsfiddle.net/m93qg/733/
[15:02:27] <wunz> that one doens't have the error
[15:02:41] <duch_kazatel> it does for me.
[15:03:21] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/xdzbzYu.png
[15:04:00] <wunz> grrrr
[15:04:26] <wunz> you have any spot to host it?
[15:04:29] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[15:06:20] <phuh> snover duch_kazatel: thanks guys
[15:06:25] <phuh> closing tag was the problem
[15:06:48] <duch_kazatel> yeah I forgot about the closing tag thing - script is one of those taht needs a separate closing tag.
[15:10:51] <wunz> darn this thing is a headache
[15:24:10] <Es0teric> wunz how do i access the backlog?
[15:33:08] <Es0teric> thats wierd why am i not able to access the jquery log?
[15:34:30] <alainus> could someone help me understand this code? https://gist.github.com/alainus/2e808a2ab7d4391de11e, why did it define AI.fn and then set $.fn.ai = AI.fn, and why is it saving AI as $.AI?
[15:34:39] <tucan> Hmm I think I misunderstood what getJSON returns, an explanation says the anonymous function being a callback function but what does this mean?
[15:49:28] <tucan> strangely it still does not work when i use a global variable and  do    $.getJSON("http://www.dictionary.org/ws/" + inp + "/" + lang_sel, function(data){        json = data;	});
[15:51:07] <Velveeta> tucan: what are you trying to do?
[15:51:40] <tucan> i just want to get back the json from a web service
[15:52:00] <tucan> and store it in a variable
[15:52:30] <Velveeta> alainus: the short answer to your question would be "because somebody wrote that plugin really weirdly"
[15:53:00] <Velveeta> tucan: and what's happening when you execute that code? because at a glance, it looks correct
[15:55:01] <tucan> Velveeta: nothing is displayed
[15:55:11] <tucan> but the status code is 200 OK
[15:55:28] <Velveeta> well you don't have that code displaying anything, just storing it into a global 'json' variable
[15:56:54] <tucan> Velveeta: I'm using with a template engine  $("#search_results").html(template(json));
[15:57:19] <tucan> when i manually assign my json to the variable json, it just works
[15:57:32] <Velveeta> can you put together a jsfiddle example so i can see how you actually have your code ordered?
[15:57:46] <Velveeta> because i have an idea of what's going on here, but i need to see your code to confirm that
[15:57:50] <tucan> ok
[15:59:00] <wunz> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/WH47L/
[15:59:07] <wunz> that's what you're looking for
[15:59:24] <Velveeta> you can also just use .empty() in that case
[16:01:19] <tucan> Velveeta: can i just pm you the url? cuz i forgot the webservice doesnt allow jsfiddle to access
[16:02:39] <Velveeta> well i don't need to see it actually functioning, i just need to see how you wrote your code
[16:03:15] <tucan> ok
[16:04:23] <tucan> Velveeta: http://jsfiddle.net/pGh5L/2/
[16:04:57] <tucan> whoops, i pasted the wrong version
[16:05:19] <tucan> http://jsfiddle.net/pGh5L/3/
[16:09:27] <Velveeta> ok, so yeah, i see your problem
[16:09:45] <Velveeta> you're treating that getJSON call like a synchronous operation, when it's asynchronous
[16:10:03] <Velveeta> you're trying to pass your json data to your template before the request is actually done fetching it
[16:10:20] <Velveeta> you need to put your call to .html(template(json)) inside of your callback to getJSON
[16:10:31] <Velveeta> and you can scrap the 'json' global altogether, and just pass 'data' to your template
[16:12:40] <tucan> oh that works
[16:12:56] <tucan> but honestly I don't know what these things mean
[16:13:26] <tucan> what makes a function asynchronous?
[16:14:48] <tucan> and what if i needed to use data again
[16:14:59] <tucan> in another event handler?
[16:15:14] <Velveeta> ajax means "asynchronous javascript and xml"... it's a request sent to the server, which executes in the background, and its status is periodically checked to see if it's complete
[16:15:33] <Velveeta> so your other code continues to execute immediately, while that request runs in the background, and when the request is finished, it executes the callback
[16:16:15] <Velveeta> if you needed to use data again, you would then need to either store it into a higher-level variable like you were doing w/ the global json, or you could broadcast an event in your callback, and pass the data along with it, to catch in other segments of code that have event listeners waiting
[16:17:07] <tucan> oh ok
[16:19:10] <Velveeta> a synchronous function is one that executes immediately and returns and is finished when the next line executes, so something like this: myElement.empty(); myElement.append('<div>blah</div>'); alert(myElement.text()); //etc
[16:19:57] <Velveeta> asynchronous functions are any of the ajax functions, animation functions, etc, that take time to execute, and just alert your code when they're done
[16:29:36] <duch_kazatel> work beer
[16:29:55] <duch_kazatel> we call it “weekly wins” - who all had a weekly win?
[16:33:58] <Es0teric> wunz are you still there?
[16:37:23] <Velveeta> i've had the last of a weekly win in my desk drawer for over 2 years now
[16:37:29] <Velveeta> i don't know what occasion i'm waiting for to finish it
[16:37:46] <Jattenalle> look at this handsome chat, look at it! http://i.imgur.com/Mra2tSR.png
[16:40:13] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta what is it?
[16:40:24] <Velveeta> the end of a bottle of bushmills
[16:40:41] <Velveeta> i went through most of it over the course of a week, when i first started
[16:41:08] <Velveeta> back then, alcohol at the desks wasn't frowned upon, the company even stocked beer for us in the drink fridge... but as we grew and grew, it got to be more of a liability, so it's restricted now
[16:53:27] <lethjakman> hey, jquery $.post is appending a weird object to my string. any idea what's going on? https://gist.github.com/lethjakman/9146834
[16:53:44] <lethjakman> I'm using rails if that makes any difference...
[16:56:29] <duch_kazatel> what is id?
[16:56:52] <duch_kazatel> because it doesn’t look like a string.
[16:57:25] <lethjakman> duch_kazatel: how do I convert it to a string? it should be...
[16:57:41] <lethjakman> id is the id of the page it looks like that UUID I posted
[16:57:59] <duch_kazatel> do console.log(id) right before that post.  what do you get?
[16:58:34] <lethjakman> duch_kazatel: "c7845f2f-f8ba-4990-8058-bfb8cb046c37"
[16:58:38] <lethjakman> without the string around it
[16:58:40] <lethjakman> taht was me
[16:58:42] <lethjakman> er...quotes
[16:59:28] <duch_kazatel> there you go - pop a .toString() on id in your string builder.
[16:59:39] <duch_kazatel> connect_url = "/connects/" + id.toString();
[17:00:56] <lethjakman> duch_kazatel: same thing.
[17:02:01] <lethjakman> duch_kazatel: seems to have one less / though.
[17:06:32] <Velveeta> you don't have any kind of $.ajaxSetup thing in place that auto-appends some data to every request or anything do you?
[17:06:49] <lethjakman> Velveeta: not that I know of...
[17:06:57] <lethjakman> ugh this is so annoying
[17:06:59] <Velveeta> hmmm... are you using chrome to debug?
[17:07:03] <lethjakman> it's invisible console log
[17:07:05] <lethjakman> yep
[17:07:16] <Velveeta> if so, you can set an xhr breakpoint so that it breaks in the debugger anytime it encounters a certain url
[17:07:29] <Velveeta> and then you can try to step through the stack trace and see where it's coming from
[17:07:33] <lethjakman> Velveeta: how do yu do that?
[17:08:59] <Velveeta> in your sources tab, look for the 'XHR Breakpoints' expandable pane
[17:09:13] <Velveeta> click the + sign and enter a portion of the url, maybe that UUID
[17:09:41] <Velveeta> and when the debugger pauses it, you'll see the stack trace in that same area, you can click through previous function calls until you find the one that's constructing the url
[17:09:48] <Velveeta> and try to figure out what's adding it to the url
[17:10:28] <T13|sleeps> Your id is already a string.  .toString() shouldn't be needed.
[17:13:02] <T13|sleeps> What's console.log(connect_id); returning?
[17:13:13] <lethjakman> yeah it's just a string....
[17:13:23] <lethjakman> T13|sleeps: it's in the log, it's just the UUID
[17:13:55] <T13|sleeps> What do you get if you change it to console.log(typeof(connect_id));
[17:14:38] <T13|sleeps> And the typeof?
[17:16:27] <lethjakman> T13|sleeps: string.
[17:19:05] <T13|sleeps> Are you reusing "id" somewhere else in the script?   Try changing the variable name to something like idMarkRead
[17:19:25] <lethjakman> so...I converted it to $.ajax with a type of 'POST' and it works better now...
[17:19:28] <lethjakman> no clue why
[17:20:02] <T13|sleeps> I'm thinking you must have another id variable or function some place.
[17:21:48] <lethjakman> interesting...
[17:21:52] <lethjakman> not that I know of
[17:21:56] <lethjakman> it's returning what I expect
[17:22:06] <lethjakman> maybe rails is shoving something into my $.post
[17:26:44] <Es0teric> anyone here?
[17:30:29] <tyfighter> anyway to abort() a deferred object? :/
[17:35:14] <duch_kazatel> why would you abort it?
[17:38:10] <tyfighter> this plugin I'm using used to return a regular xhr object with abort available, but now it's returning a deferred
[17:38:16] <tyfighter> and I see now way to abort a deferred...
[17:38:30] <duch_kazatel> you want to error it.
[17:38:54] <tyfighter> I want to abort the ajax request
[18:04:04] <TheJHNZ> http://jsfiddle.net/v2v4x/
[18:04:10] <TheJHNZ> a fiddle for you lot~!
[18:04:28] <TheJHNZ> make the span stay apacity:1 when field is focused
[18:56:20] <ericandrewlewis> is Lokesh Dhakar's lightbox plugin the "best" lightbox plugin? i.e. extensible, best options control, etc.
[18:56:57] <ericandrewlewis> it doesn't even look like it caches slide images...
[19:16:02] <gx> so I have some code within my $(document).ready that i want to move to an external JS file... no matter what I do, it doesn't seem to work when it's in the external file
[19:16:33] <gx> i'm including jquery first... and i'm loading the correct file with <script src> ... and inside the js file it starts with $(document).ready
[19:16:39] <gx> i'm confused as to what i could be doing wrong
[19:17:21] <gx> the code works fine when it's just pasted into the html within <script> tags... but when i move it to an external file and call it with <script src> it doesnt work at all
[19:18:35] <ericandrewlewis> gx: verify the script is being loaded at all
[19:18:51] <ericandrewlewis> i.e. add a breakpoint in the global scope of the script and make sure it gets hit
[19:19:04] <ericandrewlewis> or do a console.log() int he global scope of the script
[19:19:15] <gx> ahh. nevermind i figured it out
[19:19:24] <gx> i forgot i was echoing <?=$base_url?>
[19:19:29] <gx> stupid mistake
[19:19:42] <gx> it was loading but the ajax url was wrong
[19:19:44] <gx> all good, thanks
[20:41:31] <neredsenvy> I have a category tree structure using ul>li>ul.. Anyhow I have a window.onload function which allows these elements to be collapsed and closed. However after the document is loaded i still make onClick ajax requests that add additional ul>li elements to that tree structure however those elements then cant be collapsed.
[20:44:22] <neredsenvy> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/58273cb7c570a2b3ad88 For instance if you look at my source code, first I create a ul > li > ul >li .. tree using PHP then I have a jquery function to be able to show and hide these nodes, Now this works all well. However after that I also have a function that does ajax request that then adds additional elements but these cannot be collapsed or closed .
[20:48:19] <Blue_Hat> Hey guys...
[20:48:29] <Blue_Hat> this bit of code is giving me problems
[20:48:35] <Blue_Hat> http://jsfiddle.net/ey6Ca/
[20:49:12] <Blue_Hat> I want the div that is clicked on or scrolled to to get highlighted in the navbar
[20:51:07] <Blue_Hat> this is the link
[20:51:10] <Blue_Hat> http://cmit.com.jm/templates/grovewood/
[20:51:24] <Blue_Hat> the link is highlighted in the nav when you click it
[20:51:39] <Blue_Hat> but not highlighted when you scroll, how do I fix that?
[21:57:53] <Velveeta> neredsenvy and blue_hat: do you 2 still need help?
[21:58:28] <Blue_Hat> Velveeta: Yes I do
[21:58:32] <Blue_Hat> thanks for asking
[21:58:44] <Velveeta> no problemo, that's what i'm here for..... on occasion :D
[21:59:03] <Velveeta> loading your example now to look at it
[21:59:39] <Blue_Hat> thanks
[21:59:48] <Blue_Hat> you have the page too?
[22:00:33] <Velveeta> yep, and probably the simplest thing for you to do would be to use something like bootstrap's scrollspy: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy
[22:01:04] <Velveeta> however, if you don't want the overhead of loading those extra files to do it, you can do it with a scroll listener, and have to calculate the scrollTop value and figure out what section you're in
[22:02:59] <Velveeta> i'll show you an example, but can't guarantee it'll work since i'm working with an incomplete fiddle
[22:03:31] <Blue_Hat> ok
[22:03:38] <Blue_Hat> you got the link to the site?
[22:03:47] <Blue_Hat> I want it to highlight when I scrool too
[22:04:45] <Velveeta> yes, i saw the site
[22:05:18] <Blue_Hat> and you get the picture?
[22:05:54] <Blue_Hat> I've been doing some work on it, so its a bit different now, same idea tho
[22:06:10] <Blue_Hat> haven't messed with the javascript however
[22:08:04] <Velveeta> yes i get the picture also, i'm writing you an example of what you need to do
[22:08:15] <Velveeta> did you look at scrollspy?
[22:08:58] <Blue_Hat> scrollspy?
[22:09:02] <Blue_Hat> no...
[22:09:24] <Velveeta> i posted you a link up above
[22:10:48] <Blue_Hat> where's the link?
[22:11:21] <Velveeta> "yep, and probably the simplest thing for you to do would be to use something like bootstrap's scrollspy: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy"
[22:14:05] <Velveeta> so, you'll want to do something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/ey6Ca/1/ ... the code below your initial code
[22:14:51] <Velveeta> it has a 50ms debounce on the scroll event so that it's not such an expensive operation, and that's dependent on underscore, so if you don't have that in place, you'll need to use a debounce function of some sort, or else remove the debounce function wrapper altogether
[22:15:15] <Blue_Hat> so I can just put that in the code straight?
[22:15:42] <Velveeta> sure, but i can pretty much guarantee it's not gonna work right off the bat, because it's untested
[22:15:53] <Velveeta> because this fiddle example is incomplete
[22:16:07] <Blue_Hat> ok
[22:16:12] <Blue_Hat> let me see
[22:17:09] <Blue_Hat> doesn't work
[22:17:34] <Velveeta> well yeah, i just told you that :D
[22:17:48] <Blue_Hat> with the scrollspy all I would need to do is implement there stuff since I already linked to jQuery?
[22:17:49] <neredsenvy> Velveeta: Nah figured I just need to rebind the onclick event.
[22:18:00] <Velveeta> that's a starting point for you, you'll have to tweak it to make it work, unless you actually put up a working jsfiddle demo that i can muck with
[22:18:29] <Velveeta> i'm not sure what all you need to load to make scrollspy work, i only know that it does something similar to what you're looking for, i don't use bootstrap myself
[22:18:55] <Velveeta> neredsenvy: you'd be even better off delegating that click event to a higher container so you only ever have to bind it a single time to 1 element
