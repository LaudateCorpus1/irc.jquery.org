[00:09:39] <muzone_> hey
[00:09:40] <muzone_> At my jQuery+RaphaelJS world map at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WNzY8/ - I'm trying to use a SVGZ map instead (http://home.no/dwaynie/BlankMap-World8.svgz) because the SVG is too big. I've been told this is possible by "loading the SVGZ via jQuery, reading it as XML and then drawing the paths". Anybody know how though?
[00:46:03] <Chani> muzone_: I have no idea, but as a shot in the dark, maybe this might somehow help? http://keith-wood.name/svg.html
[00:48:34] <muzone_> Chani: nah
[00:48:56] <m0no> I have a form with a textarea which a user can put html in. I dont quite understand how to use selectors on this content ...
[00:48:58] <muzone_> Chani: raphaeljs is a jquery vector/svg library so that part is already covered
[00:52:37] <ProLoser|Work> anyone around?
[00:52:40] <obsd123> when I copy something to data() will that something disappear if I remove it from the DOM?
[00:54:30] <sasori> question: how to do it in jquery datepicker. let's say i want it to show the time only and it should be am and pm option $('#starttime').datepicker("");  ?
[00:54:46] <vlt> Hello. Can I use JQuery to select all elements matching id="element[i]" where i is a number and then put i in a variable?
[00:54:46] <vlt> Hello. Can I use JQuery to select all elements matching id="element[i]" where i is a number and then put i in a variable?
[00:55:14] <Hierofant> can i be a number?
[00:55:25] <calvinmcgee> At this page, http://www.cultdesign.nu, I have two carousels. This is the js, http://www.cultdesign.nu/wp-content/themes/cdTheme/js/custom_slider.js. My problem is that when I click on the buttons for the first carousel, it controls the second carousel. The second carousel however, works as expected.
[00:55:26] <m0no> so I guess what I am trying to do is use jquery selectors on the html content of a textarea
[00:58:16] <Hierofant> vlt don't think ids can be numbers.
[00:58:34] <Hooloovoo> calvinmcgee: a sec and i'll have a look
[00:59:16] <muzone_> Hierofant: sup man hows the music production?
[00:59:55] <calvinmcgee> Hooloovoo: nice
[01:00:42] <Hierofant> hola muzone.  Pretty good!  I'm making an ambient piece for an installation.  You?
[01:01:16] <Hooloovoo> calvinmcgee: when you declare the vars at the top
[01:01:20] <Hooloovoo> try adding var in front
[01:01:40] <Hooloovoo> could be that they take a global var and changes it somewhere in there.
[01:02:12] <muzone_> Hierofant: cool
[01:02:24] <muzone_> Hierofant: do let us hear it when ur done
[01:02:48] <muzone_> Hierofant: my last track was like a month ago.. but ive been getting good response on it
[01:03:17] <calvinmcgee> Hooloovoo: I'm not a javascript expert, but I know OOP. I know that the elements I declare becomes global, but how do I write them so that they become properties to the object?
[01:03:18] <muzone_> really hoping to make some serious money with the help of jquery so i can focus everything on music production but.. still a long way to go for that:)
[01:04:12] <aaronmcadam> calvinmcgee: use dot notation
[01:04:14] <Hierofant> cool man, good luck to ya!  Tough times
[01:04:47] <Hooloovoo> calvinmcgee: http://pastebin.com/VBbxGcev
[01:04:48] <Hooloovoo> try that
[01:05:00] <Hooloovoo> also, change everywhere where the vars are used to self.varname
[01:05:01] <aaronmcadam> have one global variable for your app so you can namespace your variables calvinmcgee
[01:05:50] <calvinmcgee> Hooloovoo: ok, I get it now. Thanks
[01:06:08] <calvinmcgee> aaronmcadam: will do that :)
[01:06:10] <muzone_> At my jQuery+RaphaelJS world map at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/WNzY8/ - I wanna replace the map with a more detailed one - http://home.no/dwaynie/BlankMap-World8.svgz - and it's gotta be SVGZ because the SVG version is just way too big. I've been told I gotta "load the SVGZ via jQuery, read it as XML and then draw the paths". But how? http://groups.google.com/group/raphaeljs/browse_thread/thread/b5c407be8bcf9373/42dc95cc30630d50
[01:06:51] <aaronmcadam> calvinmcgee: here, taken from crockford's The Good Parts: https://gist.github.com/1075573
[01:07:32] <Hooloovoo> calvinmcgee: np
[01:09:32] <Hooloovoo> anyone know a nice trick to run a event callback wherever i click except on one element?
[01:10:21] <Azrael_-> hi
[01:10:27] <Azrael_-> i try the jquery tools overlay and want the displayed div to have opacity. but when i display it, the filter for ie is automatically overwritten. how can i change this?
[01:10:45] <ravenzz> ?not @ Hooloovoo
[01:10:45] <bot-t> Hooloovoo, .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[01:10:53] <aaronmcadam> Azrael_-: short answer, don't use jQuery Tools, find a decent library
[01:11:14] <ravenzz> ^
[01:11:14] <Azrael_-> aaronmcadam: can you suggest me some alternatives?
[01:11:19] <aaronmcadam> it's API is a great example of pure shit
[01:11:26] <aaronmcadam> Azrael_-: Fancybox
[01:11:36] <Hooloovoo> bot-t: yup, but i suspect i'd have to use a $(document) selector or something to make the click event trigger everywhere. and i can't exclude elements with :not on that, can i?
[01:11:36] <bot-t> Hooloovoo, Without a doubt.
[01:11:45] <Azrael_-> k, will have a look into it
[01:11:49] <ravenzz> ?bot

[01:15:25] <Hooloovoo> ravenzz: Ohh that's clever. Thanks! =D
[01:16:02] <aaronmcadam> ?nuke
[01:16:02] <bot-t> ** Nuclear Launch Detected **
[01:16:04] <ravenzz> body * instead of body > *
[01:16:11] <aaronmcadam> aah
[01:16:21] <aaronmcadam> * selectors, really? do you really have to?
[01:16:21] <Hooloovoo> yup figured that out =)
[01:16:43] <sasori> anyone knows a good timepicker ? like , e.g it will only show a slider and once I selected..it will give an output like e.g 7:00am
[01:16:58] <aaronmcadam> if you want a click anywhere within the body to fire, just $('body') will suffice
[01:17:22] <aaronmcadam> sliders for time selection suck balls
[01:17:39] <aaronmcadam> trying to define a specific time is hard
[01:18:02] <ravenzz> aaronmcadam yep but he want a click for any element not anywhere
[01:18:32] <sasori> aaronmcadam: can you recommend/suggest what to use ?
[01:18:34] <aaronmcadam> * selectors are really bad tho
[01:18:59] <ravenzz> don't mind. that's what he need
[01:18:59] <aaronmcadam> it's a tricky problem from a UX point of view sasori
[01:19:12] <aaronmcadam> I've not seen any widgets that really work
[01:19:40] <aaronmcadam> plugins like these are a *bit* better
[01:19:41] <aaronmcadam> http://haineault.com/media/jquery/ui-timepickr/page/
[01:19:47] <aaronmcadam> otherwise, just use an input mask
[01:20:03] <aaronmcadam> sasori: http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[01:21:49] <sasori> there's one that i used to use before..but it was solely made for a php framework..this time am coding manually :| i dunno what to use
[01:22:13] <vlt> Hierofant: I don't want the whole id to be a number but the "i". Example: id="foo[42]"
[01:22:19] <vlt> Hierofant: How can I select this?
[01:22:26] <cypha> aaronmcadam, nice
[01:24:31] <vlt> I'm trying to select an element with id="foo[42]" but $('#foo[42]') doesn't work. How to handle arrays?
[01:25:05] <bot-t> #vlt, If you wish to use any of the meta-characters (#;&,.+*~':"!^$[]()=>|/ ) as a literal part of a name, you must escape the character with two backslashes: \\. http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ Also this is probably a bad idea, but... http://j.mp/autoescapeselector
[01:26:13] <Hierofant> vlt - that would be $('#foo\\[42\\]')
[01:26:36] <aaronmcadam> ahh
[01:26:46] <aaronmcadam> you'd save yourself some bother if u didn't use []
[01:26:50] <aaronmcadam> or is this some crap cms
[01:27:24] <Hierofant> so the id has an arraqy?
[01:27:26] <Hierofant> *array
[01:27:36] <ProLoser|Work> anyone use templates?
[01:27:41] <Hierofant> odd, I'd have made that a class if the DOM goes any deeper
[01:27:44] <ProLoser|Work> i'm getting a huge afucking headache with mine
[01:28:04] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[01:28:17] <aaronmcadam> what templating lib?
[01:28:28] <ProLoser|Work> $.tmpl
[01:29:49] <aaronmcadam> k
[01:29:51] <aaronmcadam> ?p
[01:29:51] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:29:51] <ProLoser|Work> i'm nesting templates, but i'm having trouble with 1: passing data to nested templates and 2: working with nullable values
[01:30:01] <aaronmcadam> that's your issue there then
[01:30:04] <vlt> aaronmcadam, Hierofant: I have a bunch of text input fields numbered from foo[1] to foo[25]. Now every field has an onclick="doSomething(i);". I want to clean that up.
[01:30:10] <aaronmcadam> why are you nesting?
[01:30:20] <aaronmcadam> aaah
[01:30:22] <aaronmcadam> jesus
[01:30:23] <ProLoser|Work> because {{tmpl}} is available, and because my boss is a moron
[01:30:25] <aaronmcadam> that's shit :D
[01:30:45] <aaronmcadam> you could test for the vars
[01:30:56] <aaronmcadam> the "nullable values"
[01:31:01] <ProLoser|Work> aaronmcadam: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/479708/
[01:31:02] <Hierofant> vlt why are you doing that the hard way
[01:31:04] <aaronmcadam> just fiddle an example
[01:31:10] <aaronmcadam> don't gimme no static text shit :P
[01:31:23] <ProLoser|Work> very hard to give a working example
[01:31:24] <vlt> Hierofant: Because I still need your help to do it right ;-)
[01:31:40] <aaronmcadam> it's easy, abstracting your problem will help
[01:31:47] <vlt> Hierofant: How would a sane person do this?
[01:32:05] <ProLoser|Work> jsfiddle.net isn't loading :(

[01:32:11] <muzone_> oh fuck.. wrong paste
[01:32:15] <aaronmcadam> hahah
[01:32:35] <muzone_> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/2KxLx/ (jquery+raphaeljs) - I'm trying to load this new high-definition world map. I've been told I gotta "load the SVGZ via jQuery, read it as XML and then draw the paths". But how? http://groups.google.com/group/raphaeljs/browse_thread/thread/b5c407be8bcf9373/42dc95cc30630d50
[01:32:36] <aaronmcadam> vlt just class your inputs
[01:32:52] <Hierofant> he should ID them
[01:33:03] <aaronmcadam> It doesn't matter
[01:33:12] <aaronmcadam> you can get the index in the click function if u need to
[01:33:22] <Hierofant> HA muzone_
[01:33:28] <Azrael_-> aaronmcadam: got a problem with fancybox: when i click a link i want the normal href to be loaded but additionally shown a loading-overlay. don't really understand how i could achieve this with fancybox
[01:33:41] <aaronmcadam> uh
[01:33:49] <aaronmcadam> you can fire it on ready
[01:34:03] <aaronmcadam> on the linked to page
[01:34:35] <aaronmcadam> ah right yeah I know what you want
[01:34:41] <Azrael_-> no, i want it to be shown while the browser is waiting for the response of the linked page
[01:34:45] <aaronmcadam> it only shows the overlay for ajax
[01:34:56] <aaronmcadam> I think colorbox shows one for everything
[01:35:11] <Azrael_-> hehe, ok, will also have a look into this :) thx
[01:35:18] <aaronmcadam> s/overlay/loading gif
[01:36:02] <Azrael_-> i can create the view of the loading-animation/overlay myself
[01:36:23] <Azrael_-> i just need a js-lib who provides me the option to show an overlay and still allow the href to load
[01:36:37] <Azrael_-> thus doesn't link the overlay to the href in a link
[01:36:42] <aaronmcadam> actually
[01:36:46] <aaronmcadam> beforeShow or something
[01:37:10] <aaronmcadam> I'm confused now haha
[01:37:23] <aaronmcadam> that makes no sense
[01:37:25] <Azrael_-> i'm quite new to the js-libs
[01:37:31] <aaronmcadam> yeah I figured
[01:37:36] <Azrael_-> thus i don't know how to do much manually
[01:37:55] <aaronmcadam> I'm confused about what you want now
[01:39:04] <m0no> so var textaread_content = $('#my_textarea).val(); then I want to use a selector on the content -> var mydiv = $(textarea_content).find('#mydiv').val();
[01:39:15] <m0no> except this doesnt work :(
[01:39:38] <Azrael_-> in jquery tools i had to options to refer to a div using <a href="mylink" rel="spinner1"> and it displayed the div "spinner1" while loading "mylink". but i have the problems with opacity. fancybox only seems to be meant to display "mylink" in an overlay and nothing else. do you understand?
[01:39:44] <vlt> aaronmcadam: I rewrote it to id="foo-1" ... How can I rewrite that function to make it work for all "foo-*" elements?  http://jsfiddle.net/qtJTP/54/
[01:40:11] <aaronmcadam> class the fuckin things
[01:40:31] <muzone_> Hierofant: what?
[01:40:44] <muzone_> oh the thai bakery thing
[01:40:51] <aaronmcadam> for do $( 'form' ).find( 'input '). click(....);
[01:42:22] <Hierofant> hmm, alert('yes')?
[01:42:30] <vlt> aaronmcadam: In the old function I just have to run "i++;" to select() the next input field. Can you give an example, please, how to achieve this with JQuery?
[01:42:49] <aaronmcadam> Azrael_-: Colorbox is another

[01:47:09] <vlt> How to derive "bar-1" from "foo-1" if I don't have the "1" isolated?
[01:47:32] <aaronmcadam> what?
[01:47:55] <aaronmcadam> could you just see ?p your code instead of asking random arbitrary questions
[01:47:56] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:47:58] <ravenzz> vlt regex?
[01:48:26] <vlt> aaronmcadam: In my function (in the code I pasted) I do something with $('#bar-1').
[01:48:34] <aaronmcadam> You don't need to do that
[01:49:07] <aaronmcadam> $( ['#bar-', $(this).index() + 2].join('') )
[01:49:53] <aaronmcadam> you need to read the api
[01:50:06] <m0no> hmm how can I select an attribute that isnt enclose in quote, such as <div id=myid> - yes I know this is badly formed
[01:50:11] <vlt> aaronmcadam: Thanks.  I can *feel* that JQuery makes a lot of thing much easier, I just don't know yet how to begin ;-)
[01:50:25] <aaronmcadam> that's why you need to read the links I sent u
[01:51:44] <ravenzz> uhm but.. does he need a such selector? or he is looking for a way to retrieve the suffix to built a new string?
[01:51:55] <ProLoser|Work> aaronmcadam: having trouble making a test case: http://jsfiddle.net/N7Fcm/

[01:53:39] <aaronmcadam> have u read its docs Azrael_-

[01:54:15] <aaronmcadam> for god's sake
[01:54:37] <ravenzz> vlt then you need to retrieve the "-1" substring to select $('#bar'+theID)

[02:02:56] <OnkelTem> Hi all. My website hangs in IE7 - it eats 100% CPU for a minute and then shows a message about stopping the script. How do I know what exactly makes this?
[02:03:25] <ravenzz> ?demo @ OnkelTem
[02:03:26] <bot-t> OnkelTem, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[02:03:59] <cognominal> .append( '<div/>').text( text)     seems equivalent to .append.text(text)     so that does not work either
[02:05:37] <aaronmcadam> does append return jQuery
[02:05:43] <coldhead> yes
[02:05:52] <coldhead> you should know this aaronmcadam
[02:06:02] <aaronmcadam> there's so many methods
[02:06:07] <aaronmcadam> I want a bloody list
[02:06:20] <aaronmcadam> I keep meaning to make an XSLT so I can list them
[02:06:22] <cognominal> ravenzz, coldhead, do you know the answer to my question?
[02:06:47] <coldhead> sorry cognominal, it's my first day using jQuery
[02:06:54] <aaronmcadam> cognominal: $(..).text() will replace all text content
[02:06:57] <aaronmcadam> not append it
[02:07:08] <aaronmcadam> haha you lying fuck :P
[02:07:23] * SugaSlide hugs coldhead
[02:07:25] <coldhead> how rude
[02:07:29] <coldhead> hey sugsy
[02:07:40] <ravenzz> cognominal do you need escape()
[02:07:46] <ravenzz> or something like addslashes
[02:07:47] <aaronmcadam> i meant it in a nice way :P
[02:07:59] <aaronmcadam> ahh php :S
[02:08:04] <aaronmcadam> lovely stuff... hahaha
[02:08:28] <aaronmcadam> why aren't you using templating anyway cognominal
[02:08:31] <ravenzz> o striptags or what?
[02:08:47] <aaronmcadam> or just don't concatenate html
[02:09:46] <cognominal> aaronmcadam, this is dynamically generated code; I am not sure how templating would help.
[02:09:53] <aaronmcadam> hah
[02:10:04] <aaronmcadam> how are you getting the text variable
[02:10:10] <cognominal> meaning generated client side.
[02:10:22] <aaronmcadam> I'm talking about javascript templating obviously
[02:10:52] <aaronmcadam> jq-tmpl, mustache, underscore templating (awesome)
[02:11:00] <cognominal> aaronmcadam, can yougive me an url so I get some context
[02:11:00] <aaronmcadam> haml-js, etc etc etc
[02:11:18] <SugaSlide> jqote2 <3
[02:11:30] <cognominal> ok, I know some underscode. I will check.
[02:11:37] <aaronmcadam> cognominal: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jq-tmpl
[02:12:10] <aaronmcadam> yeah underscore templating is really easy
[02:16:43] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[02:17:24] <aaronmcadam> haha
[02:17:25] <Hierofant>  .append( '<div>' + text + '</div>') should work, no?
[02:17:33] <aaronmcadam> it is when ur as sexy as us coldhead
[02:17:55] <aaronmcadam> yeah if you're workin in 2009 or something :P
[02:17:59] <seutje> oh cloddy :')
[02:18:25] <aaronmcadam> it's not good form adding html like that anymore
[02:19:09] <seutje> Hierofant: I usually try to work the other way around to be able to keep chaining
[02:19:37] <seutje> $('div', {'text': text}).appendTo(...).keepGoing()
[02:19:59] <Hierofant> heh
[02:20:09] <Hierofant> appendTo instead eh
[02:20:18] <Hierofant> ok was just trying to help whats his cognominal
[02:20:24] <aaronmcadam> html :  _.template( messageTemplate, { messages : messages } );
[02:20:35] <aaronmcadam> even better seutje
[02:21:38] <aaronmcadam> the new el creation obj literal api is much better right :D
[02:21:44] <aaronmcadam> well newish* 1.4.2
[02:22:04] <aaronmcadam> I think many people still don't use it
[02:26:22] <cognominal> seutje, thx, that looks like what I search. I prefer not to load to many packages.
[02:27:15] <seutje> is that a go for zepto?
[02:27:30] <cognominal> zepto?
[02:29:04] <cognominal> suetjs, I did not know .appendTo() and   $( 'div', ( 'text': text)) is new to me but that feel right
[02:30:13] <cognominal> I have yet to hit the right page to get the later.
[02:31:09] <quicksilver> cognominal: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery2
[02:31:40] <quicksilver> however I think seutje was wrong
[02:31:50] <quicksilver> I think it's $('<div/>',{ 'text' : text})
[02:32:18] <aaronmcadam> fuck's sake, it's been like 10 years and firefox's view source is still shit
[02:33:01] <aaronmcadam> it is quicksilver
[02:34:52] <aaronmcadam> cognominal: http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/jquery-1-4-released-the-15-new-features-you-must-know/
[02:35:03] <aaronmcadam> that post covers the usage
[02:36:25] <cognominal> aaronmcadam, seutje. thx for the help. I feel I understand everything now.
[02:38:35] <blackspotwiggins> everything?

[02:40:12] <coldhead> protip: join his cult, the kool-aid is excellent
[02:41:56] <Maarten_PI>  hi all, i've got a question about encoding and cookies. at the moment i'm storing input values (unsanitized in cookies). these values are later on used for a query in PHP (where they are sanitized), my question is whatś the harm and if so, should I do sth about it?
[02:47:06] <thomaslfromZ> hello
[02:47:48] <thomaslfromZ> cross domain can not work with load(), right?
[02:47:59] <coldhead> right
[02:48:05] <thomaslfromZ> Is it a security problem?
[02:48:10] <coldhead> yes
[02:48:37] <Cork> thomaslfromZ: load is just a ajax call that puts the response in an element
[02:48:44] <Cork> and ajax cross domain is xss
[02:49:16] <Maarten_PI> it has to do with the same domain policy
[02:49:33] <Maarten_PI> it's a restriction in jquery (javascript?)
[02:49:36] <thomaslfromZ> ok, got it. but how could I fetch content from cross domain. PHP and the load()
[02:49:37] <blackspotwiggins> same origin policy
[02:49:50] <Maarten_PI> if you want to load external data, use an iframe and load it to src
[02:50:11] <Maarten_PI> thx blackspotwiggins, that's the one ;)
[02:50:12] <blackspotwiggins> sop still applies
[02:50:18] <blackspotwiggins> with iframes
[02:50:31] <thomaslfromZ> oh
[02:50:50] <Maarten_PI> ah, i tried the trick on my own domain with another internal page, didn't give it a spin with external pages yet
[02:50:50] <blackspotwiggins> you can load things, but there are some restrictions
[02:51:00] <thomaslfromZ> I could render an html with php, save it on my server an load that with jquery, right?
[02:51:06] <blackspotwiggins> scripts cant mess with your page and so on
[02:52:05] <Cork> theres two way you can get around it if you have it on the same top domain
[02:52:23] <Cork> one is to have an iframe broker, that does the ajax call
[02:52:43] <Cork> to get them to talk you set document.domain to the same top domain
[02:52:56] <Cork> it works in all browsers but is messy, as you have to have an iframe
[02:53:23] <Cork> the other is cors, its clean but doesn't work in older browsers (ie<9 opera)
[02:53:44] <thomaslfromZ> If its not on the same top doamin, lets say x.info collects from Y.com there is no way, unless Y.com has an API, or something, right?
[02:53:46] <Cork> sorry my mistake its ie<7
[02:54:02] <blackspotwiggins> use yql or proxy on serverside
[02:54:07] <Cork> thomaslfromZ: then its only jsonp or cors
[02:54:08] <thomaslfromZ> cors?
[02:54:10] <blackspotwiggins> it's a mess if you dont use cors
[02:54:17] <Cork> ?mdc cors
[02:54:18] <bot-t> Cork, HTTP access control - MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/HTTP_access_control
[02:54:41] <Cork> thomaslfromZ: but as i said, its not cross browser supported
[02:55:15] <thomaslfromZ> cheers

[03:01:34] <ravenzz> I wouln't the user to insert a captcha code in my form, so when the user type something in a form input field i would retrieve an hash code by performing an ajax request
[03:01:37] <ravenzz> is it safe?
[03:05:07] <scratcha> i have integrated with a third party postcode look up solution. I want to protect calls to this script to within my application only. (to prevent it being hijacked and used elsewhere). i know that HTTP_REFERER must be considered tainted, as its coming from the users browser. is there a solution i could implement, without having to use captchas, that would provide an automatic and secure verification that the script has been called from within my application?
[03:05:08] <scratcha> perhaps a session based check? or is that equally as vunerable ?
[03:06:44] <courpse> I have 3 spans, 2 inside a parent span, $('.spoiler span:first').hover(function(){ $(this.parent() + 'span:last').css('display', 'inline-block') }); This wn't even trigger the hover function. my parent span has class spoiler.
[03:06:48] <courpse> Any points pls?
[03:06:53] <courpse> Pointers*
[03:13:11] <Hierofant> $(this.parent() + 'span:last') =  $('parentyspan:last'), no?
[03:13:21] <Hierofant> think you need the space
[03:13:59] <courpse> Yes, belivei would, lol.
[03:14:04] <courpse> Missed that thanks.
[03:14:41] <courpse> Althou, i just removed everything, and made it $('.spoiler').hover(function(){alert('test');}); and it still did nothing, not even an error.
[03:47:28] <HardPhuc> can i get the element's bottom border Y position relative the the document's?
[03:48:24] <HardPhuc> I want to test whether the whole element is visible above the fold or not
[03:58:31] <sean`> HardPhuc, you can do: document height - (element height + element offset.top)
[03:59:20] <HardPhuc> sean is the element offset top always the value from the element to the top border of viewport?
[03:59:46] <paulanthony> hey guys - i'm using the jquery.ui.mouse.js script to get the jq ui slider to work on the ipad...but it's causing a problem in that only the first slider will slide...and it requires some fiddling to get the second slider to function. the trouble always occurs on the 2nd slider attempted....any clues?
[04:00:59] <sean`> HardPhuc, the top offset is the offset from 0,0 of the document
[04:02:36] <HardPhuc> ok, thanx
[04:02:47] <harsh_\9mile> hi there..
[04:04:43] <harsh_\9mile> hello..anybody there..
[04:06:01] <Aamir> harsh_\9mile:  no pm plz
[04:06:10] <Aamir> ?ask @harsh_\9mile
[04:06:11] <bot-t> harsh_\9mile, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[04:07:24] <harsh_\9mile> okay...anyways..
[04:07:35] <harsh_\9mile> i'm using a jquery plugin
[04:07:49] <harsh_\9mile> which uses the hashing technique
[04:08:11] <harsh_\9mile> for loading the page..it's kinda sigle page navigation
[04:09:10] <harsh_\9mile> which is why always when you click on the link that adds hash symbol in the url
[04:09:40] <harsh_\9mile> like in #index.html
[04:10:12] <harsh_\9mile> this makes the navigation smooth and dynamic
[04:11:09] <harsh_\9mile> in one of the page i'm using a form which sends the form data via jquery post method without having to reload the page
[04:12:22] <harsh_\9mile> so what happens is that when the url is #contact.html jquery post function doesn't seems to work..
[04:12:34] <harsh_\9mile> but when the url is just contact.html
[04:12:44] <harsh_\9mile> it works
[04:12:56] <harsh_\9mile> this problem is only seen in opera
[04:13:40] <harsh_\9mile> i want to know why isn't post function not working with opera when the url is #contact.html
[04:21:37] <Azrael_-> i want to display an overlay with an animated loading gif when sb clicks on a specific link until the new page is loading (20sec delay). in ff it works fine but in ie the animation of the gif just stops. any ideas how to solve this?
[04:27:53] <silo> I am having an issue with getting some json data and displaying it - the tags are displayed rather than rendered.. i.e. instead of a return i get <br /> printed on the page.... My json is here: http://pastebin.com/jAL77pb4
[04:28:05] <silo> I have been pulling my hair out over this one...
[04:28:19] <seutje> Azrael_-: known issue: just reassign the src
[04:28:36] <silo> Any help would be awesome :D
[04:29:31] <harsh_\9mile> hi there.. i'm using a jquery plugin which uses the hashing technique for loading the page..it's kinda single page navigation which is why always when you click on the link to other pages that adds hash symbol in the url,this makes the navigation smooth and dynamic. in one of the page i'm using a form which sends the form data via jquery post method without having to reload the page. so what happens is that when the url is #co
[04:29:40] <harsh_\9mile> but when the url is just contact.html it works. this problem is only seen in opera. i want to know why isn't post function not working with opera when the url is #contact.html
[04:31:01] <seutje> silo: that's not valid JSON, but how are u trying to get it rendered?
[04:31:26] <Azrael_-> seutje: can you please explain, don't understand
[04:31:41] <seutje> Azrael_-: foo.src = foo.src
[04:32:01] <silo> seutje: it validates in jsonlint, maybe because that paste is from the chrome plugin jsonview
[04:32:03] <Azrael_-> seutje: when shall i do this?
[04:32:25] <seutje> Azrael_-: when it stops moving :D
[04:32:36] <silo> seutje: I am using jquery template to render it
[04:32:53] <silo> through jquery mobile too...
[04:33:08] <seutje> silo: I'd expect jquery template to escape
[04:33:37] <silo> ahh your right
[04:33:53] <silo> thanks seutje :)
[04:34:02] <Azrael_-> seutje: i'm quite new to using js in this manner. i display the overlay and then let the default action of the a href take place. then it stops moving. how do i get an event after this action to reasign the src?
[04:36:02] <seutje> Azrael_-: it usually stops when certain events are fired, just do the switcheroo in a handler bound to that event
[04:37:14] <seutje> Azrael_-: or just use http://fgnass.github.com/spin.js/ :P
[04:39:10] <Azrael_-> hmmm, is js still executed when the browser loads a new site?
[04:39:47] <Azrael_-> e.g. you are on site 1, click to load a new one and the new one take 20sec to send the first byte?
[04:40:26] <muzone> At my jquery+raphaeljs world map at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/2KxLx/1/ - I'm trying to load this new high-definition SVGZ map. According to http://tinyurl.com/3heefl7 I gotta "load the SVGZ via jQuery, read it as XML and then draw the paths". But how?
[04:40:45] <seutje> Azrael_-: u mean beforeunload?
[04:41:37] <Azrael_-> i mean, if i used the spinner.js, will it stop moving or will it still spin until the new site sends the first byte?
[04:42:27] <seutje> Azrael_-: it will keep spinning until u tell it to fuck off
[04:42:41] <Azrael_-> k, then i'll try the spinner.js, thx
[04:47:19] <seutje> it's spin.js, but alright
[04:49:30] <voot545> having some trouble figuring out checkbox manipulation
[04:49:40] <voot545> rather, it just seems to not be working

[04:54:53] <_ramo> hi
[04:55:48] <_ramo> could the jQuery(window).unload  directive be a problem in chrome version 14 ?  should something like that work: http://jsfiddle.net/TMyZv/ ?
[05:08:43] <seutje> _ramo: if u fix the syntax error, sure
[05:09:35] <_ramo> seutje: thanks, http://jsfiddle.net/TMyZv/1/ but this is not working in chrome
[05:09:44] <_ramo> but in firefox
[05:10:01] <_ramo> and ie9
[05:10:14] <seutje> _ramo: works fine on my chromesies
[05:10:24] <_ramo> seutje: which version do you got?
[05:10:30] <seutje> 14
[05:10:35] <evildmp> Hi - I have discovered that this - https://bitbucket.org/spookylukey/semanticeditor/src/3a40b4766f32/semanticeditor/static/semanticeditor/javascript/wymeditor/plugins/semantic/wymeditor.semantic.js - is incompatible with version 1.4.2 of jQuery
[05:10:48] <_ramo> seutje: i have 14.0.835.186 m on windows
[05:10:57] <muzone> ccmonsters: Any clue about this? At my jquery+raphaeljs world map at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/2KxLx/1/ - I'm trying to load this new high-definition SVGZ map. According to http://tinyurl.com/3heefl7 I gotta "load the SVGZ via jQuery, read it as XML and then draw the paths". But how?
[05:11:16] <evildmp> not knowing anything about jQuery, is there some sensible way of trying to find out where the incompatibility might be?
[05:11:30] <seutje> _ramo: also works on my chrome 10
[05:12:15] <seutje> _ramo: hmz, does indeed not work on chrome 14 on windows
[05:12:49] <_ramo> seutje: with jquery 1.6.3 it works on 14 too
[05:13:32] <seutje> _ramo: not for me
[05:14:01] <_ramo> seutje: sorry... wrong browser
[05:14:20] <seutje> evildmp: what's the error?
[05:14:41] <_ramo> seutje: what to do?
[05:14:42] <_ramo> hmm
[05:14:49] <evildmp> seutje: no error is reported in the console, annoyingly, but the expected functionality breaks
[05:18:22] <seutje> _ramo: pray for a quick and painless death
[05:18:28] <cognominal> [11:38]  <blackspotwiggins> everything?   <== everything in the pasted code. Words have meaning only in context.
[05:18:52] <_ramo> seutje: where would i see if its death or not? ;)
[05:18:58] <blackspotwiggins> yeah i got that :D
[05:20:25] <seutje> _ramo: death as in the noun, not dead as in the adjective
[05:21:29] <_ramo> seutje: yeah, but where would i see if this is fixed? is it a chrome or jquery issue?
[05:22:17] <sr972> Hi@all
[05:22:21] <seutje> I suspect a chrome issue, coz u know... only occurs in 1 version on a specific platform
[05:22:59] <_ramo> seutje: so you've tested it on several versions?
[05:23:46] <sr972> if someone could talk a look at http://www.administrator.de/index.php?content=173448 to help me with a problem, it would be great.. text is in german.. if someone needs a translation, just tell me :)
[05:24:49] <Aquaguy> Hey there!

[05:26:36] <phrearch> ajpiano: experimented a bit with getting codemirror2 running with infinote
[05:26:52] <phrearch> seems to run fine so far. even with remote cursors
[05:27:53] <Aquaguy> I'm retrieving some data from a php file using post. What I am getting are paths so in the php I use htmlentities($path) before returning the path. The problem comes when using other languages, like spanish or french that have acute vowels á é í ó ú à â …. for example: instead of "Prácticas" I'm getting "PrÃ¡cticas" is there any way to decode that back to show the original text?
[05:29:04] <phrearch> Aquaguy: utf8?
[05:29:26] <Aquaguy> yes, and I've set the charset to utf-8
[05:29:57] <Aquaguy> <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
[05:29:57] <phrearch> seems like jquery uses utf-8 by default. is your server returning that as well?
[05:30:11] <seutje> Aquaguy: can u verify that the response is properly encoded
[05:30:28] <Aquaguy> seutje: how can I check that?
[05:30:33] <seutje> u look at it
[05:30:42] <Distilled> can anyone recommend a good way to handle star ratings?
[05:31:14] <seutje> Aquaguy: most browsers allow u to look at raw XHR requests
[05:31:54] <seutje> Distilled: yea: very carefully
[05:32:34] <phrearch> Aquaguy: firebug probably for firefox, or chromium/chrome console
[05:33:17] <Aquaguy> mmm query is receiving /Pr&Atilde;&iexcl;cticas/ for /Prácticas/ so I guess it's alright
[05:35:22] <sr972> if someone could talk a look at http://www.administrator.de/index.php?content=173448 to help me with a problem, it would be great.. text is in german.. if someone needs a translation, just tell me :)
[05:35:28] <seutje> hmz, why is that A capitalized and why does it add the funky I?
[05:41:44] <Distilled> seutje, care to elucidate your thoughts?
[05:42:20] <seutje> nope, coz I'm not sure what to elucidate even means :D
[05:42:25] <seutje> ?define elucidate
[05:42:27] <bot-t> seutje, elucidate - (verb) To make clear; to clarify; to shed light upon.
[05:42:45] <Distilled> How about now?
[05:42:49] <seutje> sure
[05:43:20] <seutje> voting touches various privacy topics, so should be handled with care :D
[05:45:22] <Distilled> Maybe rating was the wrong word. It won't be an aggregated rating, it will be a set rating, 1-5. If User #1 sets the rating to 5, and then User #2 sets the rating to 2, then the rating is 2. Not 3.5 or some other value in between.
[05:51:55] <anoob> if i have a collection with objects ($('.something'), for example), can i get another array with a specific property of these object?
[05:54:03] <ablomen> anoob, like this >> https://gist.github.com/1231956 ?
[05:54:47] <lz> haha he called you a noob
[05:55:05] <lz> back to work..
[05:56:36] <innociv> What is the proper way to do "delete obj.innerObj[ID];"?  I'm getting 'TypeError: Cannot convert null to object'
[05:58:39] <lz> just set obj.innerObj[ID] to undefined
[05:59:27] <Azrael_-> what tool do you suggest to make your javascript code more compact?
[05:59:46] <lz> google closure compiler / YUI compressor
[05:59:57] <lz> I hear the closure compiler's better
[06:00:14] <blackspotwiggins> uglifier
[06:00:18] <blackspotwiggins> uglifyjs
[06:01:45] <Azrael_-> k, thx

[06:06:24] <Blaster> anyone know how to add an option to a specific <optgroup>?  $("#id optgroup[label='optGroupLabel']").append('<option>Text</option>') adds one, but on the second try (different option text/value) doesn't add
[06:06:34] <ablomen> anoob, use $.map, like i showed you
[06:06:53] <anoob> ablomen, thanks
[06:09:43] <Blaster> my problem above is webkit browsers only
[06:09:57] <steffen> strange: if i have a modal window with tabs, it is not possible to get user/pass values from input type text fields. Anyone else encountered this problem, too?
[06:10:49] <steffen> user = $('#user').val() does not work, returns undefined.
[06:11:17] <steffen> just get rid of the tab and everything works as it should.

[06:18:23] <ae86-drifter> why does a jquery selector fire a callback twice? is there a way to make it fire once only?
[06:18:48] <ae86-drifter> if the selector matches two elements i mean
[06:18:52] <lz> yes
[06:19:01] <lz> use the :first selector?
[06:19:33] <Blaster> why does it seem impossible to add an <option> to an <optgroup label="My Optgroup"> inside a <select> reliably with jQuery?
[06:20:19] <ae86-drifter> I want to select two objects at once with a selector, but have a single callback
[06:20:45] <ae86-drifter> Blaster: Append?
[06:21:41] <anoob> ablomen, i've modified the element with map function... it's returning an empty array

[06:22:01] <NL_Ed> Hi, doest anyone know how I can get jquery to check tinyMCE text areas in a method similair to (this).val()
[06:22:14] <Blaster> ae86-drifter:  Yes, it works fine in Firefox, but in Opera, it only works once, the second append doesn't add the option.
[06:22:30] <ablomen> anoob, you are not returning anything
[06:22:38] <ae86-drifter> Blaster: you could give the optgroups id's
[06:22:47] <ae86-drifter> then append() the them
[06:22:52] <Blaster> ae86-drifter:  Yes I tried that, same result
[06:22:52] <steffen> Blaster: Where do I pass bugs? I found one.
[06:23:24] <anoob> sorry ablomen :(
[06:23:24] <ae86-drifter> who cares about opera :P
[06:23:31] <NL_Ed> erichynds: Hey Eric, Remember when you did that thing for me a while back? Worked like a charm, thanks :)
[06:23:40] <Blaster> ae86-drifter: The bug actually includes all webkit browsers
[06:24:05] <ae86-drifter> oh well thats differnt then :)
[06:27:29] <ChampS_> is there a js function to position a textcursor on a textarea on index(n)?
[06:30:43] <muzone> At my jquery+raphaeljs world map at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/2KxLx/4/ - I'm trying to load this new high-definition SVGZ map. According to http://tinyurl.com/3heefl7 I gotta "load the SVGZ via jQuery, read it as XML and then draw the paths". But how?
[06:35:36] <faraway> hi ..i'm working on a drag'n'drop script which allows to drag elements to an iframe. now cause i loose the mouse move info as soon as the mouse enters the iframe, i added a mousemove listener to the iframes document. now i'm wondering how i could simulate a mousemove event in the root document. so that the callback there will be called
[06:39:20] <faraway> ah ok .. found the solution
[06:40:46] <geekbuntu_> .
[06:41:39] <tktiddle> How can i get "value" from <input type='hidden' name='ex' value='b201' /> ?
[06:42:25] <geekbuntu_> $(input.find([name='ex']).val()?
[06:47:22] <fakingfantastic> how can I get the response headers in the $.ajax success callback?
[06:53:47] <jeffsmykil> I have a safari bug from hell and it sucks
[06:54:59] <kdnky> clicks in safari 5.1 are able to fail
[06:57:15] <jeffsmykil> this is unfortunately a css bug, but so obscure no one knows about it it seems
[07:01:33] <innociv> What do I do about if( io ) giving the error "io is not defined"?  Well duh, that's what I'm checking.
[07:03:20] <innociv> hm
[07:03:22] <innociv> typeof i guess
[07:04:21] <m0no> I have a form with an input box that contains a complete html page. I can target the particular form input like var myhtml = $('id_html').val(); no problem, but how can I target elements contained in my_html? In particular I am trying to target a <div class=repTopDetails id=repTopDetails>
[07:04:21] <aaronmcadam> that won't make a difference
[07:04:24] <aaronmcadam> if io is right
[07:04:42] <aaronmcadam> try
[07:04:50] <aaronmcadam> var io = io || somethingElse
[07:06:20] <Nicolas_Leonidas> hey I wanna run a function after a delay, does this work ? $().delay().myfunction();
[07:06:38] <Nicolas_Leonidas> or rather $().delay(5000).myfunction();
[07:06:44] <jeffsmykil> Nicolas_Leonidas:  I think you can only delay animations iirc
[07:06:48] <jeffsmykil> but im probably wrong
[07:07:47] <aaronmcadam> ?delay
[07:07:48] <bot-t> .delay(duration, [queueName]): Set a timer to delay execution of subsequent items in the queue. http://api.jquery.com/delay/
[07:08:27] <mbroadst> do either of the two most popular jquery context menu plugins support submenus?
[07:08:28] <aaronmcadam> jeffsmykil, Nicolas_Leonidas "Added to jQuery in version 1.4, the .delay() method allows us to delay the execution of functions that follow it in the queue."
[07:08:38] <mbroadst> they don't seem to make mention of it on their main pages
[07:08:43] <jeffsmykil> my bad
[07:08:58] <aaronmcadam> "delay() is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function,"
[07:09:07] <aaronmcadam> you're partially right jeffsmykil
[07:09:24] <aaronmcadam> i.e. you can't cancel the delay()
[07:09:35] <aaronmcadam> as in there's no clearTimeout equivalent
[07:09:47] <aaronmcadam> so it's best for animation queues
[07:10:22] <Blaster> hey I have a table with a bunch of rows.  Each row has a delete button.  How can I identify which row is to be deleted through jquery?
[07:10:37] <mbroadst> or can someone point me to the best context menu plugin with submenu support?
[07:10:45] <aaronmcadam> Blaster: $( this ).closest('tr').index()

[07:12:54] <Blaster> lol
[07:12:59] <aaronmcadam> explains how to use it
[07:13:00] <Blaster> i understand it
[07:14:02] <aaronmcadam> k
[07:14:26] <Blaster> i appreciate that tip, could be a very valuable solution for getting help here
[07:14:40] <aaronmcadam> yes
[07:14:42] <aaronmcadam> it's a must
[07:14:45] <surial> How do I figure out if a jquery object has no matched elements in it?
[07:14:55] <surial> .is("*") seems weird... and not sure if that would work.
[07:15:12] <aaronmcadam> surial:
[07:15:16] <aaronmcadam> $( el ).length
[07:15:20] <surial> ahhhh....
[07:15:23] <surial> mucho gracias.
[07:15:41] <aaronmcadam> $( el ).length && doSomethingIfElExists()
[07:15:55] <surial> testing now.
[07:16:14] <aaronmcadam> $( el ).length || return; // return if no el exists
[07:16:43] <surial> yes, that works. Thanks!
[07:16:57] <aaronmcadam> I knew it would ;) tehee
[07:17:39] <Blaster> Quick question:  If you add a link via jQuery <a href="#" class="test">  then in your code call $(".test").click(function() { alert("test"); });  shouldn't that work?  It only seems to work if I add the link via actual HTML.
[07:19:05] <aaronmcadam> ?p @ Blaster

[07:22:45] <Blaster> for some reason mIRC won't open links since I uninstalled firefox
[07:22:56] <aaronmcadam> you're not preventing default
[07:23:22] <Blaster> return false in the second function?
[07:23:23] <Blaster> is that it?
[07:23:35] <aaronmcadam> no don't use that
[07:23:47] <aaronmcadam> wait a sec
[07:24:04] <aaronmcadam> ah
[07:24:16] <aaronmcadam> you should be using $.delegate or $.fn.live() there

[07:27:21] <aaronmcadam> wha?
[07:27:22] <Blaster> aaronmcadam:thanks
[07:27:23] <wizbit> i like the way something looks and would like to use it myself
[07:27:29] <aaronmcadam> ah
[07:27:35] <aaronmcadam> install fireQuery
[07:27:38] <blackspotwiggins> wizbit, the source is there
[07:27:41] <pootietang> hi guys, I would like to know how I can switch an element's ID on click.
[07:27:47] <aaronmcadam> i think he means the actual functions
[07:27:49] <blackspotwiggins> both css and js
[07:27:52] <aaronmcadam> the scripts
[07:28:07] <blackspotwiggins> there might be legal consequences to stealing stuff tho
[07:28:09] <aaronmcadam> usually a pain depending on how the site's been written
[07:28:14] <wizbit> blackspotwiggins: if you click on a product, i like the way the image zooms, then you click on it again, and it goes back to normal: http://shop.canonical.com/product_info.php?products_id=878
[07:28:34] <blackspotwiggins> write it yourself?
[07:28:43] <wizbit> blackspotwiggins: thats beyond my scope
[07:28:46] <aaronmcadam> that's a simple effect
[07:28:49] <aaronmcadam> fancybox et al
[07:28:50] <blackspotwiggins> well then, better learn
[07:28:59] <wizbit> blackspotwiggins: what is the proper name for that effect?
[07:29:06] <aaronmcadam> lightbox
[07:29:08] <wizbit> oh
[07:29:17] <aaronmcadam> ?g fancybox @ wizbit
[07:29:18] <bot-t> wizbit, Fancybox - Fancy lightbox alternative - http://fancybox.net/
[07:29:28] <wizbit> lightbox or fancybox ?
[07:29:29] <aaronmcadam> ?g yahoo ui design patterns @ wizbit
[07:29:29] <blackspotwiggins> can't do shit -> steal it
[07:29:29] <bot-t> wizbit, Yahoo! Design Pattern Library - http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/
[07:29:31] <blackspotwiggins> makes sense :)
[07:30:46] <wizbit> the lightbox page shows examples not as fast as the example i showed you
[07:30:58] <aaronmcadam> actually that canonical site's lightbox is basic as fuck
[07:31:12] <wizbit> aaronmcadam: and its fast and snappy
[07:31:13] <aaronmcadam> not lightbox, it's fuckin ancient
[07:31:22] <aaronmcadam> FANCYBOX
[07:31:37] <wizbit> i mean fancybox page, the examples are slow
[07:31:37] <aaronmcadam> it's easy to customise it
[07:31:58] <n04r_> Hi all, I'm too stupid to build a selector that does the following
[07:32:28] <n04r_> Select all inputs that do not have a class beginning with some text
[07:32:52] <n04r_> Can someone give me a hint?
[07:33:16] <aaronmcadam> that's gonna be a shit slow selector
[07:33:38] <blackspotwiggins> n04r_, why would you select by class with only beginning?
[07:33:47] <blackspotwiggins> you know elements can have multiple classes
[07:33:49] <aaronmcadam> n04r_: http://api.jquery.com/attribute-contains-prefix-selector/
[07:33:59] <n04r_> Because i want to ;)
[07:34:03] <aaronmcadam> don't
[07:34:03] <wizbit> how can you tell what the canonical site uses?
[07:34:06] <aaronmcadam> if you've got control
[07:34:22] <aaronmcadam> don't you use firebug wizbit
[07:34:41] <wizbit> aaronmcadam: i got chrome developer
[07:35:24] <aaronmcadam> wizbit: http://shop.canonical.com/prodimg.js
[07:35:34] <n04r_> Hmm, I want to bind some kind of regex-check to every input on a page depending on its class
[07:35:41] <wizbit> aaronmcadam: is that lightbox?
[07:35:50] <aaronmcadam> that's their own
[07:35:54] <wizbit> i see
[07:35:54] <aaronmcadam> and you can tell
[07:36:10] <wizbit> thats why its so fast
[07:36:15] <aaronmcadam> and shit
[07:36:19] <wizbit> :(
[07:36:34] <aaronmcadam> not even namespaced or anything
[07:36:44] <aaronmcadam> very bad form
[07:36:55] <wizbit> well it is 'ubuntu' so what do you expect :P
[07:37:16] <aaronmcadam> what ubuntu's community are awesome
[07:37:37] <wizbit> here is another example
[07:37:38] <wizbit> http://www.google-store.com/product_info.php?products_id=1627

[07:39:48] <ClownShack> question: i am learning to make plugins, and am building a lightbox. I am setting a range of parameters when instantiating each lightbox. I'm dealing with scope issues and need some help - anybody got some time to help me out?
[07:41:14] <ClownShack> anybody?
[07:41:19] <wizbit> here is another example: http://intlstore.mozilla.org/product_info.php?products_id=121
[07:41:27] <wizbit> it looks like all 3 stores are using the same custom code

[07:44:02] <philluminati> I have an array of select boxes, and I'd like to see all the selected values lined, up. Can someone help me fix that line above pleasE?
[07:44:16] <amh345> i have an ordered list menu system with ahrefs in each <li>.  is there a good method of making the entire <li> inherit the function of the ahref?
[07:44:55] <aaronmcadam> yea
[07:46:00] <Blaster> aaronmcadam:  What do you do with that delegate if the element doesn't have a parent class?
[07:46:12] <ccmonsters> parent element
[07:46:46] <Blaster> like this?  $("<tr>").delegate(...)
[07:49:47] <jinxdone> amh345, typically you would make the anchor {display:block; height 100%;} with css? I didn't quite understand what you were after though..
[07:50:33] <amh345> ii wanted the entire <li>ahref</li> clickable. not just the href work
[07:50:35] <amh345> word*
[07:50:48] <amh345> i didnt think to use css though. ill try your suggestion
[07:51:00] <jinxdone> just make the anchor 100% width and height
[07:51:26] <amh345> ok, thank you
[07:51:35] <aaronmcadam> Blaster: any  containing element will work
[07:52:26] <DrogoNevets> amh345: : and display block
[07:52:48] <Blaster> aaronmcadam: I'm making a fiddle
[07:53:04] <jeffsmykil> What's the syntax for returning multiple values to a function?
[07:53:22] <Elephant> returning an array?
[07:53:41] <DrogoNevets> returning to a function or from a function?
[07:53:54] <DrogoNevets> (if to im not sure i know what you mean)
[07:54:03] <jeffsmykil> so in the function i do var foo = foo();
[07:54:08] <aaronmcadam> Blaster: use your head
[07:54:13] <aaronmcadam> $( body )
[07:54:47] <Blaster> I did... so why isn't it working here: http://jsfiddle.net/JKEY4/2/
[07:55:11] <Blaster> disregard the .null, in my actual script the table row is created dynamically
[07:55:34] <jeffsmykil> and then in the foo(); i do return foo;
[07:55:41] <jeffsmykil> can i do that with multiple values?
[07:56:09] <Elephant> you can only return one variable afaik, but that var can be an array
[07:56:31] <jeffsmykil> fair enough
[07:59:01] <jinxdone> ClownShack, make a jsfiddle or some other example of the issue you are having?
[07:59:12] <notnek> Blaster: I wrapped body in quotes and it worked fine.
[07:59:40] <ClownShack> k 1 sec
[08:00:03] <Blaster> wow is it just me or is jsfiddle really slow?
[08:00:12] <ClownShack> yea - happenin to me too
[08:00:49] <ClownShack> must be crashing for now … lolz … ugh
[08:00:52] <Blaster> notnek: thanks for the tip.  you fixed my issue
[08:00:57] <muzone> yo guys
[08:01:04] <muzone> mind if i do some waterboarding on yall
[08:01:11] <notnek> Blaster: no problem
[08:01:35] <muzone> At my jquery+raphaeljs world map at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/2KxLx/8/ - I'm trying to load this new high-definition SVGZ map. According to http://tinyurl.com/3heefl7 I gotta "load the SVGZ via jQuery, read it as XML and then draw the paths". But how?
[08:02:06] <ClownShack> jinxdone: ill just host it and msg you the url if thats fine
[08:02:46] <DrogoNevets> muzone: first load the xml, probably with a $.ajax request set the dataType to XML
[08:03:21] <logik-bomb> guys how do I remove everything from my array apart from the initial X elements?
[08:03:38] <daevski> Is there an easy way to grab info between &lt; and &gt; ?
[08:04:15] <erichynds> ?mdc splice @ logik-bomb
[08:04:16] <bot-t> logik-bomb, splice - MDN - Changes the content of an array, adding new elements while removing old elements. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
[08:04:17] <Elephant> daevski: like attributes of elements, or the actual text?
[08:04:38] <muzone> DrogoNevets: what you think of my fiddle though?
[08:04:52] <logik-bomb> thanks
[08:04:55] <DrogoNevets> muzone: what a you wanting from it?
[08:05:09] <daevski> Elephant, just like .html(), but &lt; and &gt; are text and not tags :)
[08:05:27] <muzone> DrogoNevets: same as the below "low-definition world map"
[08:05:49] <daevski> Elephant, the text between them. I manually have '<email@address.com>' spit out.
[08:05:50] <muzone> DrogoNevets: except using BlankMap-World8.svgz (note the gz compression there)
[08:05:51] <Elephant> daevski: is wrapping them in a <div>/<span> and using .html() on that an option>?
[08:06:10] <DrogoNevets> muzone: ill have a look in abit im just off home
[08:06:25] <Elephant> so do <span id=email><email@addr.com></span>
[08:06:29] <muzone> great, thanks man
[08:06:36] <daevski> Elephant, it's in a span, I could maybe do another span and then strip the < >. I wouldn't know how with JS though
[08:07:06] <daevski> Elephant, oh, or just maybe span around the text only lol
[08:07:13] <Elephant> yeah
[08:07:17] <daevski> Elephant, brb :)
[08:07:34] <logik-bomb> splice is really usefull. thanks erichynds
[08:07:38] <Elephant> or format the data as you get it from the user, if you're going to use it in the fashion.
[08:08:26] <jeffsmykil> Is there a way to deal with asynchronous function calls besides chaining them together?
[08:09:09] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: deferreds
[08:09:38] <jeffsmykil> erichynds:  not in my jquery book
[08:09:49] <muzone> jeffsmykil: you wrote a jquery book??
[08:09:54] <erichynds> it's a 1.5+ feature
[08:10:01] <jeffsmykil> no the book i have hear
[08:10:19] <jeffsmykil> aha
[08:10:22] <jeffsmykil> this is only a 1.4 book
[08:12:25] <Elephant> jeffsmykil: the jQuery docs are pretty rad.
[08:12:49] <jeffsmykil> i like books too though, make it look like i do something at work
[08:14:21] <jeffsmykil> lol erichynds  I found your website
[08:14:28] <erichynds> :)
[08:16:11] <jeffsmykil> and now i know what you look like and where you live
[08:16:29] <sphinxxxx> is anyone in #php that can invite me?
[08:16:59] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: will this make a page hang?
[08:17:10] <erichynds> nope
[08:17:24] <jeffsmykil> so you are essentially still cahining?
[08:17:29] <jeffsmykil> chainning>
[08:17:42] <erichynds> you can manage it differently
[08:18:01] <erichynds> instead of nesting callbacks, you can break them out more easily... $.when(fn1(), fn2(), fn3()) etc
[08:18:09] <jeffsmykil> k
[08:18:18] <jeffsmykil> what part of Mass? I'm right above you in NH
[08:19:28] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: what part of Mass?
[08:19:29] <erichynds> cool
[08:19:30] <erichynds> boston
[08:19:37] <jeffsmykil> MIT or harvard?
[08:19:41] <erichynds> wat
[08:19:44] <jeffsmykil> im joking
[08:19:50] <jeffsmykil> are you in cambridge?
[08:19:51] <erichynds> i work a stone's throw from MIT
[08:20:12] <snover> don’t throw stones at MIT undergrads, erichynds.
[08:20:18] <geekbuntu_> does anyone know of any jquery-ui repo's?  got roped into doing a freebie for a church directory and want it to be 'quick' :-D
[08:20:28] <jeffsmykil> snover: they don't notice half the time
[08:20:30] <erichynds> hipsters!
[08:21:02] <Elephant> I'm neo-hipster
[08:21:22] * geekbuntu_ elephants in general are MEGA HIPSTERS
[08:21:37] <Elephant> lol
[08:21:53] <Elephant> we were doing a lot of stuff before it was cool.
[08:22:23] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: you must be good at what you do if you can afford to live in boston :-p
[08:22:48] <erichynds> jeffsmykil: i actually scored a dirt cheap apartment because my landlord is 99 years old
[08:22:49] <erichynds> lol
[08:23:13] <jeffsmykil> they haven't heard of inflation?
[08:23:19] <erichynds> i pay his bills once a week, and he cuts the rent.
[08:23:40] <geekbuntu_> erichynds: you better get a portable defibulator
[08:23:45] <geekbuntu_> keep his @$$ alive
[08:23:59] <jeffsmykil> or become very good at pupeteering
[08:24:05] <erichynds> that's what I'm saying
[08:25:20] <daevski> if $('li.query-name') is generated after the page load, should this still work? Within document ready: $('li.query-name').click(selectUser)
[08:25:42] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: the pupeteering part, or the defribilator part?
[08:25:55] <geekbuntu_> defib you don't want a rubber horse glove
[08:27:57] <daevski> Let me be more basic. $('li.query-name').click(function(){ $(this).hide() })
[08:28:25] <daevski> Doesn't seem to work and my thought is that maybe it's because it's generated after the page loads (user action creates it)
[08:29:25] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: this seems more complicated for me then chaining :(
[08:30:33] <muzone> DrogoNevets: back yet?
[08:30:47] <muzone> DrogoNevets: http://home.no/dwaynie/map.html is what i got so far
[08:33:17] <nohorse> when processing a click event I have the event.target.  is there a way to get to a selected from there?  I'm looking for $(event.target).parent('a').data('id')
[08:33:41] <jeffsmykil> wouldnt that be attr("id")
[08:33:57] <aaronmcadam> oh god no
[08:34:03] <aaronmcadam> delete that from your mind
[08:34:07] <aaronmcadam> use what's already there
[08:34:18] <aaronmcadam> el.id
[08:34:20] <jeffsmykil> wait who are you talking to and about what
[08:34:32] <aaronmcadam> or if wrapped $( el )[0].id
[08:34:41] <aaronmcadam> don't use attr('id') :)
[08:34:41] <jeffsmykil> ok so dont ever listen to me, i dont know what im talking about!
[08:39:15] <aidan> is this going to do what I want? markers[category].push(gMarker);
[08:39:29] <aidan> markers is empty and I don't know why :/ console.log before the push shows.
[08:40:48] <aaronmcadam> need to remove empty paragrapgs
[08:40:51] <aaronmcadam> paragraphs
[08:41:10] <aaronmcadam> !$(this).trim().length && $(this).remove() maybe?
[08:41:46] <aaronmcadam> or $(this).trim().length || $(this).remove()
[08:42:13] <Haprog> trim() doesn't work like that. what would you want it to do there?
[08:42:32] <fris> $("p").filter(function() { return $.trim($(this).text()) === ""; }).remove();
[08:42:39] <pifantastic> $.trim($(this).text())
[08:42:44] <aaronmcadam> i want to take a p that is empty but has some spaces in it
[08:42:57] <aaronmcadam> i can't control it cuz of how django works and the templates are set up
[08:43:11] <aaronmcadam> some paragraphs have one or two spaces
[08:43:14] <pifantastic> fris' solution is nice
[08:43:16] <aaronmcadam> and i want to drop them
[08:43:29] <aaronmcadam> yes but it may not actually equal ""
[08:43:30] <pifantastic> although you are going to have a flash of space and then a reflow aaronmcadam
[08:43:33] <aaronmcadam> ah
[08:43:37] <aaronmcadam> no i'm not
[08:43:40] <pifantastic> it's going to be jarring to users
[08:43:41] <aaronmcadam> it's for a collapsible
[08:43:45] <pifantastic> oic
[08:43:46] <aaronmcadam> jquery mobile
[08:43:53] <aaronmcadam> yeah so
[08:43:59] <aaronmcadam> the paras would already be gone
[08:44:25] <aaronmcadam> what does trim return? the trimmed string right?
[08:44:29] <Haprog> just use what fris wrote
[08:44:30] <Haprog> yes
[08:44:56] <aaronmcadam> then i don't need to do the equality check
[08:45:00] <aaronmcadam> .length will do
[08:45:23] <daevski> if $('li.query-name') is generated after the page load, should this still work? Within document ready: $('li.query-name').click(function(){ $this.hide() })
[08:45:41] <aaronmcadam> thanks Haprog, pifantastic, fris
[08:45:53] <fris> aaronmcadam if you use trim it will delete the whitespaces, so it does remove it
[08:46:13] <aaronmcadam> yeah so trim's string.length will be 0
[08:46:18] <Blaster> hey so I use $(this).closest('tr').index() to find the row of a table I'm trying to remove, then do I have to iterate or something to remove that row from the table?
[08:47:13] <nohorse> the .data('id') is the 'data-I'd' HTML5 data attribute.  I just used I'D, it could have been foo.  the $(lee) object does not seem it have DOM context.  it has no children or parents.
[08:48:16] <Haprog> Blaster: why do you use index()? just use $(this).closest('tr').remove();
[08:49:39] <Blaster> ok thanks
[08:53:13] <aaronmcadam> yeah but how the API works, you can't use $.data if you haven't already used $.fn.data for HTML5 data attrs
[08:53:47] <aaronmcadam> http://www.learningjquery.com/2011/09/using-jquerys-data-apis
[09:00:40] <jeffsmykil> erichynds if it is an ajax(); do i do ajax.success(function( response ){
[09:00:47] <erichynds> yeah
[09:00:53] <solepixel> does anyone know the proper way to programmatically change the value of a select when using uniform.js?
[09:00:55] <erichynds> $.ajax().success()
[09:01:29] <jeffsmykil> what if i have multiple .ajax() calls
[09:01:36] <jeffsmykil> will it get confused?
[09:01:44] <erichynds> nope
[09:01:56] * jeffsmykil tries to bend his mind around this
[09:01:58] <daevski> if $('li.query-name') is generated after the page load, should this still work? Within document ready: $('li.query-name').click(function(){ $this.hide() })
[09:02:03] <nohorse> it was a simply typo on my part $(event.target).parents('a').data('id') works great.  I was using parent and it only goes up one level  using parents was the key
[09:02:20] <daevski> oops
[09:02:30] <erichynds> daevski: $("li.query-name").live("click", fn)
[09:02:31] <sphinxxxx> daevski, you have to use .live
[09:02:58] <tyler> g
[09:03:02] <daevski> erichynds, sphinxxx , I forgot that existed! thank you!
[09:03:23] <jeffsmykil> i forgot i existed once, that was a rough afternoon
[09:04:12] <JAAulde> Does JS natively provide a way to hash an object for identifying a particular instance? I want to use namespaced events in jQ, but I want to the name space to be the hash of the object represented by 'this' in the function where the bind takes place.
[09:06:10] <jeffsmykil> erichynds: may I PM you?
[09:06:19] <erichynds> sure
[09:06:26] <jeffsmykil> ty
[09:06:55] <fuchstronaut> is looping over an object using for (name in obj) slower than looping over an array using for(var i=0;i<array.length;i++) ?
[09:06:58] <sphinxxxx> can anyone see this
[09:07:29] <JAAulde> sphinxxxx: I can't
[09:07:34] <sphinxxxx> lol
[09:07:37] <JAAulde> ;)
[09:07:40] <sphinxxxx> my nick is taken someone
[09:07:41] <sphinxxxx> ugh
[09:07:54] <sphinxxxx> i thought you have to nickserv identify to be able to speak?
[09:08:14] <gnarf> sphinxxxx: your nick?
[09:08:26] <gnarf> if you identify yourself you can ghost it
[09:08:56] <sphinxxxx> i'm sphinxxx
[09:09:10] <sphinxxxx> this happens sometimes where it says i'm already connected
[09:09:42] <aaronmcadam> Yeah, $(..).filter( function () { return !$.trim( $( this ).text() ).length;  })
[09:10:00] <aaronmcadam> that works :)
[09:18:07] <antihero> What's that smooth scrolling thing for long pages
[09:18:28] <antihero> like, you click an A that points to a page anchor thing
[09:18:55] <solepixel> http://www.position-absolute.com/articles/better-html-anchor-a-jquery-script-to-slide-the-scrollbar/
[09:18:57] <timing_> and then it takes longer than usual to get there, so pretty sucky :-)
[09:19:28] <solepixel> antihero: googled "jquery anchor"
[09:22:39] <JAAulde> in relation to my question, jQuery does something like this (hashing an object to identify it) internally--is this exposed for use?
[09:23:21] <amit_usual> i don't if somebody has tried this i am using the code available on the docs for facebook comment plugin , while plugin works out of the box on the profile it seems to come from some random page how do i make sure that the comment is published from my app
[09:23:29] <amit_usual> http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/
[09:26:54] <roger_padactor_> I cant for the life of get json request to work on the ipad. Im returning valid json but the iPad always gives a parseerror
[09:30:46] <JAAulde> found it--the expando property of jQuery instances. buitl in lin, not via a method which returns it. So no access for Jimmy--guess I'm writing my own
[09:30:54] <JAAulde> *built in line*
[09:35:36] <muzone> I'm trying to create the ultimate world map at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/bQAvq/ - but I'm having some trouble loading the SVGZ via jQuery, reading it as XML and then drawing the paths. Anybody know?
[09:35:49] <muzone> DrogoNevets: yo?
[09:39:36] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[09:39:42] <ProLoser|Work> anyone use templates a lot?
[09:39:51] <ProLoser|Work> do i have to check the existence/value of variables before outputting them?
[09:39:52] <sean`> ?anyone
[09:39:53] <bot-t> Somewhere, someplace, in some universe, somebody uses whatever you just asked about. However, if you actually want help with it, please just ask a question; don't ask to ask, or ask if anyone can help.
[09:40:37] <johnline3> its better than coming in and asking if they can ask a question :p
[09:40:47] <sean`> no ProLoser|Work
[09:41:12] <sean`> Unexisting variables are just left alone and will not be rendered
[09:41:13] <ProLoser|Work> i'm getting a lot of [object input] stuff
[09:42:13] <ProLoser|Work> the other thing i'm noticing is that values are persisting across loops i think
[09:42:25] <ProLoser|Work> when really they should be destroyed or emptied across loops
[09:51:07] <muzone> yo cakehero
[09:51:12] <muzone> mind if i waterboard you for a sec?
[09:51:17] <cakehero> do it
[09:52:40] <muzone> cakehero: I'm trying to create the ultimate world map at http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/bQAvq/ - but I'm having some trouble loading the SVGZ via jQuery, reading it as XML and then drawing the paths. Any clue?
[09:53:20] <cakehero> Oooooh nice
[09:53:55] <muzone> :D :D
[09:54:20] <cakehero> muzone idk what SVGZ is but lemme look
[09:54:45] <cakehero> What's SVGZ? Sorry, hard to figure out what's not working
[09:55:11] <muzone> cakehero: gzip compressed SVG
[09:55:25] <wgo> Is this an appropriate place to ask jQueryUI questions?
[09:55:27] <muzone> the high-definition map is like 1mb, way too big of a burden to put on my visitors
[09:55:46] <muzone> cakehero: the svgz though is just 170kb or something
[09:56:23] <cakehero> wgo yes
[09:56:46] <cakehero> muzone sorry but I'm in a board meeting at the moment
[09:57:00] <cakehero> muzone so i have to run, but, I can look later (hit me up next time you are online)
[09:57:34] <muzone> ttyl bro
[09:57:51] <wgo> Ok :) I have a draggable with revert: true, but I would like to destroy the revert if the item is dragged for example 100px upwards. First, how can refer to the event of how far the element is dragged?
[09:58:07] <wgo> Then, how can I override the revert based on that value?
[09:58:58] <wgo> on the drag event, what gives me the current distance dragged up
[09:59:53] <sphinxxxx> maybe this is more php than jquery, are there any plugins/tools for image resizing? (ability to select a size), and then select a crop based on that size, and then save the new image
[10:00:31] <Zer000> gents, i'm new to jquery and i was wondering if its possible to use this library to fetch a web page and use DOM to, for example, get all the images from that fetched page, then add them to the current page.
[10:00:40] <Zer000> And how would i go about doing that...
[10:00:57] <Zer000> because i don't even know where to begin :(
[10:03:38] <pachet> Zer000: $.get('foo.html', function(data){$('#mycontainer').append($('img',data));});
[10:04:25] <Zer000> pachet, wow thanks that was easy!, so function(data) is what's called back once the get finishes in this example?
[10:04:54] <pachet> exactly
[10:05:19] <m4xx> can you clone() a file field and post it to an iframe?
[10:05:44] <jigz> pachet: does $('img',data) pull only <img> from the response?
[10:07:31] <Dovoto>  http://jsbin.com/itubel/edit#javascript,html <--question: trying to swap divs from one container to another with a fade out / swap / fade in.  I think there is something i am missing as this code will fade out and it will swap, but it does not appear to fade back in (the divs end up in the right place in the DOM but the display attributes are left at 'none').
[10:07:35] <pachet> jigz: correct, you're just selecting all img tags within the jquery response object
[10:08:00] <jigz> cool, i've always used find o_o
[10:08:47] <gnarf> jigz: stick with the find, it makes more sense ;)
[10:09:05] <rabbi1> hi, which plugin to use as CRUD ? too many are around ...
[10:09:15] <gnarf> jigz: $( selector, context ) is the same as $( context ).find( selector ) only it calls like an extra function
[10:10:58] <pachet> m4xx: no, most browser security restrictions would prevent this
[10:11:15] <pachet> m4xx: what you can do is nest that input file in a form with a submit action pointing to the iframe
[10:11:44] * Dovoto idles
[10:12:13] <m4xx> pachet: could i wrap('<form />') the file element?
[10:12:34] <rabbi1> hi, which plugin to use as CRUD ? too many are around ...
[10:12:48] <rabbi1> i am working on LAMP
[10:15:13] <gnarf> m4xx: you could wrap it but there is a really good chance if you didn't wrap it before they selected a file that the act of wrapping it might deselect the file, but see ?tias
[10:15:14] <bot-t> m4xx, Try It And See
[10:15:38] <pachet> was just about to say^
[10:15:41] <m4xx> lol
[10:16:08] <pachet> any dom manip of a file input once the file is set is bad voodoo
[10:16:15] <pachet> or juju
[10:16:19] <pachet> whatever the expression is
[10:16:20] <pachet> ;o
[10:16:22] <m4xx> ;]
[10:22:17] <asidjazz> is there a way in firebug to run js in teh console for an iframe?
[10:22:26] <jigz> window.frames['ponies']
[10:22:50] <jigz> i think $(window.frames['ponies']).find('body');   ??? i'm just guessing
[10:23:10] <asidjazz> wtf
[10:24:14] <asidjazz> no i want to run code not just select the frame
[10:24:28] <jigz> oh
[10:25:05] <jigz> js in the browser is only divided by the namespace
[10:26:53] <wgo> Ok, I managed the first part of what I wanted to achieved. How do I remove an option from an instance of a plugin on the fly?
[10:27:13] <wgo> so I have revert: true and I want to make it revert: false
[10:28:01] <cloke> does anyone have a suggestion for how to make draggables work in a transform: scale div? When the parent of the dragged element is scaled the mouse coordinates don't seem to scale.
[10:29:26] <rabbi1> hi, which plugin to use as CRUD ? too many are around ...
[10:31:21] <Aquaguy> hey there again guys!
[10:31:48] <rroelofs> rabbi1: I've been backbone recently and like it
[10:32:13] <Zer000> is it possible to get a value from the css sheet for a class that isn't in the document yet?
[10:32:15] <rabbi1> backbone, trying datatables
[10:32:17] <ProLoser|Work> hallo
[10:32:21] <rabbi1> let me check
[10:32:22] <ProLoser|Work> is there a tojson method?
[10:32:43] <ProLoser|Work> i have an object i'm trying to send using $.ajax() but it's not going through
[10:32:52] <rroelofs> rabbi1:  I'm actually combing backbone with dataTables
[10:32:54] <ProLoser|Work> i thought js/jq auto-converts
[10:33:14] <rabbi1> rroelofs: combining?
[10:33:23] <Aquaguy> is there any query plugin to convert accents and that short of stuff to regular letters, let me explain myself with an example: á à â ä å ã -> a; é è ê ë -> e ....
[10:34:24] <rabbi1> rroelofs: can  you share me the backbone link?
[10:35:15] <rroelofs> rabbi1: http://documentcloud.github.com/backbone/
[10:37:18] <wgo> Hola, can anyone help me please? I need to remove an option from draggable on the fly.
[10:37:35] <wgo> make revert: true, revert: false when a condition i smet
[10:39:59] <Blaster> if i want to add another key/value to be passed when a form is submitted, should I use jQuery to add an input hidden or is there a better way?
[10:40:56] <fourcolors> Hi, I have a button that makes a div appear when you click on and I would like to make the div I made appear disappear when you click anywhere else on the screen. Is there an event for this?
[10:41:01] <fourcolors> I can't find the proper event
[10:42:08] <wgo> In answer to my own question, this appears to work: $(this).draggable('option','revert',false)
[10:45:30] <Blaster> You'd think with almost 900 people this room would provide more assistance
[10:45:37] <pachet> fourcolors: there isnt really an event for that specifically
[10:45:56] <pachet> have to bind click to the document, and check if the target is your div
[10:45:58] <pachet> if not, hide
[10:46:21] <fourcolors> pachet: hum.. I'm wondering how sites like github do it
[10:46:23] <fourcolors> oh.. right
[10:49:11] <antihero> Hey, any ideas why this isn't working?
[10:49:18] <antihero> $('li a#'+s.attr('id'), local_head).addClass('selected');
[10:49:27] <antihero> local_head is a snippet of HTML that I want to operate on
[10:50:19] <ProLoser|Work> in templates, if i do ${dates.year} and parent doesn't exist, will it break/throw an error?
[10:50:27] <ProLoser|Work> *dates doesn't exist
[10:50:45] <fourcolors> pachet: does jquery have an option to bind to the whole document? or do i need to do something like $("body").live(foo...)...
[10:51:21] <gnarf> is local_head a string?
[10:51:23] <gnarf> or a dom?
[10:51:26] <gnarf> or a jquery?
[10:51:31] <gnarf> antihero: ^^^
[10:51:47] <antihero> gnarf: A string.
[10:51:50] <pachet> in the handling where you create your div, just add a line like $(document).bind("click.a",function{...});
[10:51:55] <gnarf> antihero: it wont edit the string
[10:52:01] <pachet> then unbind "click.a" from document when you're done
[10:52:08] <antihero> gnarf: Can I make the string like a tiny localised jquery dom?
[10:52:13] <antihero> becuase it's generated
[10:52:40] <monk12> hey all. quick question... are there any free wireframing/prototype tools that have working jquery ui controls? i think i saw one but it wasn't sure.
[10:52:45] <antihero> is there a way of working on localised doms
[10:52:53] <gnarf> antihero: var domRep = $( local_head ); domRep.find( "#"+s.attr("id") ).addClass( "selected" );
[10:52:59] <monk12> some of the ones i saw, have drag and drop images that are too 'cartoony''
[10:53:19] <antihero> gnarf: Cheers
[10:58:48] <pachet> Blaster: sorry for the late response, but you could do var formStuff = $('#myForm').serialize() + "&foo=bar";
[10:59:09] <pachet> you'd end up with a query string ready to be sent out, with your value on the end
[10:59:24] <pachet> similarly, you could do something like:
[10:59:29] <pachet> var formStuff = $('#myForm').serializeArray();
[10:59:35] <pachet> formStuff[formStuff.length] = {"name: "foo", "value": "bar" };
[11:01:12] <celestius> is there a jquery equivalent to setTimeout() that pauses when the tab loses focus (i'm guessing, by using the usual jQuery event queue)?
[11:02:25] <daevski> How would I extract a value from an ajax returned json object?
[11:02:58] <daevski> nvm got it
[11:03:24] <caleb_smith> Hello all. So I'm passing some JSON data to a page, and I'm trying to handle the data, but all I can seem to do is pull objects out of an array. I'm trying to access the attributes of each object. Here is my code so far: http://dpaste.com/618453/
[11:03:53] <caleb_smith> I'm pretty new to JavaScript/Jquery btw
[11:04:58] <gnarf> caleb_smith: a) you shouldn't use for ( i in array )
[11:05:12] <gnarf> unless of course, "data.products" is really an object
[11:05:20] <gnarf> in which case you've already answered yourself
[11:05:26] <caleb_smith> hmm
[11:05:34] <gnarf> for ( key in object )
[11:05:42] <caleb_smith> Well, in the js console the log prints out object
[11:05:47] <gnarf> for ( i=0; i<array.length; i++ )
[11:06:00] <caleb_smith> can i do object.attribute or something similar?
[11:06:07] <gnarf> caleb_smith: also, see ?jQuery.each
[11:06:08] <bot-t> caleb_smith, jQuery.each(collection, callback): A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/
[11:06:18] <gnarf> also, see ?101
[11:06:19] <bot-t> also, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[11:06:31] <gnarf> there is good stuff in there about basic JS Syntax
[11:06:42] <nFFF> HTML FILE: <input type="hidden" id="layers" value="1"> -----> JS FILE:   $('layers').value = parseInt($('layers').value)+1;   <---- does this change the value of "layers" in the html to 2 or jus within the script?
[11:07:04] <gnarf> ?js var a = { test: "testing", test2: "testing 2" }; jQuery.each( a, function( key, value ) { console.log( key, " is ", value ); });
[11:07:06] <bot-t> gnarf: "test" " is " "testing""test2" " is " "testing 2"{"test": "testing", "test2": "testing 2"}
[11:07:56] <pachet> nFFF: if your syntax was right, it would change the element's value in the dom
[11:08:10] <pachet> ?.val() @ nFFF
[11:08:10] <bot-t> nFFF, .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[11:09:38] <nFFF> pachet it doesn't seem to be
[11:09:39] <caleb_smith> thanks guys. working on it
[11:09:44] <nFFF> Im having massive issue
[11:09:51] <gnarf> nFFF: you have about 5 errors in that one line of code
[11:10:02] <gnarf> a) $("layers") doesn't select that input
[11:10:06] <gnarf> $("#layers") will
[11:10:32] <gnarf> b) jQuery doesn't return dom elements, it returns jQuery objects - use ?.val insetead of .value
[11:10:33] <bot-t> .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[11:11:23] <gnarf> c) you can't assign a value to the result of a function call, so you need to pass a new value in ( standard jQuery api - .val() is a getter, .val( newVal ) is a setter )
[11:11:43] <gnarf> d) never EVER use parseInt without pasing the radix parameter of 10
[11:11:55] <ProLoser|Work> i'm getting a bunch of this in my templates: [object HTMLInputElement]
[11:11:59] <ProLoser|Work> has anyone seen this before?
[11:12:07] <ProLoser|Work> do i have to use {{html var}} ??
[11:12:21] <ProLoser|Work> or am i forced to do {{if var}}${var}{{/if}}
[11:12:26] <gnarf> leaves you with: $("#layers").val( parseInt( $("#layers").val(), 10) +1 );
[11:12:32] <gnarf> which is still silly
[11:12:45] <gnarf> you are searching for $("#layers") twice
[11:13:10] <Zeelot3k> hey guys, just wondering about the performance difference between $('<div class="foo"></div>') and $('<div></div>').addClass('foo')... is JQuery optimized somehow to make the 2nd option as fast as the first or something?
[11:13:11] <gnarf> so - var layers = $("#layers");  layers.val( parseInt( layers.val(), 10 ) + 1 )
[11:13:21] <gnarf> also, .val() can take a function
[11:13:46] <gnarf> $("#layers").val( function( index, value ) { return parseInt( value , 10 ) + 1; } );
[11:13:47] <MindSpark> hi, does anyone know how these multiple item textinput boxes are called? Like the send to many on facebook
[11:13:53] <gnarf> nFFF: that enough?
[11:13:58] <MindSpark> or if there's any jquery plugin that handles them?
[11:13:58] <ProLoser|Work> Zeelot3k: run a benchmark or look at the code
[11:14:29] <nFFF> gnarf
[11:14:31] <nFFF> thank you]
[11:14:36] <nFFF> working took me 7 hours
[11:14:45] <abstraktor> when dynamically loading javascript via $.ajax. Can I somehow catch the event "this file is loaded an starts parsing" ?
[11:17:14] <ProLoser|Work> i will PAY someone if they help me fix my problem
[11:18:33] <pachet> nFFF: mother of god
[11:18:44] <nFFF> pachet? ::>
[11:22:32] <Zeelot3k> ProLoser|Work: looks like the chaining method is much faster in my browser o_o
[11:22:44] <Zeelot3k> http://jsfiddle.net/Ws29m/1/
[11:23:19] <deadlyicon> does anyone have any idea why jQuery decided not to use RequestAnimationFrame in $.fn.delay ?
[11:23:21] <Zeelot3k> huh, running it again changes the result quite a bit
[11:24:47] <sphinxxxx> whats better to use besides "change" event
[11:24:54] <sphinxxxx> if i want it to update while typing
[11:25:01] <sphinxxxx> instead of having to click outside and lose focus
[11:25:01] <deadlyicon> keydown
[11:25:03] <deadlyicon> or keyup
[11:25:14] <sphinxxxx> in conjunction with thottling?
[11:26:24] <ProLoser|Work> Zeelot3k: i'm consistently seeing chaining being faster
[11:26:34] <Zeelot3k> hmm
[11:26:36] <ProLoser|Work> i'd imagine it's because jquery is parsing and disecting a string
[11:26:41] <deadlyicon> you could do something like {if (timeout) clearTimeout(timeout); timeout = setTimeout(function(){ … }); })
[11:26:47] <ProLoser|Work> and chaining, there's no/less parsing
[11:26:49] <ProLoser|Work> that's my guess
[11:26:54] <Zeelot3k> does that benchmark seem like it's written properly?
[11:26:59] <ProLoser|Work> seems okay to me
[11:27:03] <Zeelot3k> thanks
[11:27:32] <ProLoser|Work> what if you do it on domready?
[11:27:48] <ProLoser|Work> nvm
[11:27:51] <ProLoser|Work> okay i'm going back to my work
[11:28:05] <ProLoser|Work> someone want to help me? I WILL PAY YOU
[11:28:15] <ProLoser|Work> like 20$ paypal if you fix my problem
[11:28:15] <pachet> ProLoser|Work: do you have a fiddle ;o
[11:28:19] <ProLoser|Work> hard to make one
[11:28:46] <ProLoser|Work> 1 sec
[11:29:11] <pachet> can you elaborate on "object im trying to send"
[11:29:18] <shaft0> Is there a way to check when a form is submitted, check if any text input boxes contain an asterisk, and if they do, make sure that string is longer than 4 characters, and if not greater than 4 characters, prevent the submit, otherwise submit form as normal?
[11:30:19] <shaft0> Using the validate plugin its pretty easy to add rules, but not for all elements of type, only named elements, and it doesn't seem right to rewrite the exact same code for 10 different text boxes
[11:30:42] <shaft0> Unless I'm missing something, haha
[11:31:15] <SmartTowel> test
[11:32:16] <ProLoser|Work> http://jsfiddle.net/ProLoser/cxvnL/
[11:32:29] <ProLoser|Work> i'm having trouble getting the fiddle to work though
[11:33:04] <ProLoser|Work> tl;dr, i should be able to render the form template standalone, with no data (leaving all inputs empty by default) OR render it with data from the <li> loop
[11:33:07] <ProLoser|Work> the loops work fine
[11:33:41] <ProLoser|Work> but the blank one, with no data, gives me stuff like this for values: [object HTMLInputElement] and [object HTMLTextAreaElement] in their respective elements
[11:33:55] <ProLoser|Work> how is the template even able to introspect what tag the var is outputting in?
[11:35:53] <sphinxxxx> what's the css value for bordersize
[11:35:56] <sphinxxxx> borderSize doesn't work
[11:36:41] <gnarf> border*Width?
[11:37:06] <gnarf> * being Top/Right/Bottom/Left ?
[11:44:28] <asidjazz> sigh
[11:44:30] <sphinxxxx> ah
[11:45:01] <znow> Hi, im using NivoSlider... I want to show text beside the image, but still with the fade effect, so when it changes, a new image with text shows up, is that possible?
[11:50:30] <jgspratt> man, why am I getting "--> $("#payment_form").validate is not a function  <--" on  https://www.dordt.edu/cgi-bin/admissions/visit/trip_payment.dev.pl
[11:50:57] <jgspratt> doesn't seem to be http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1871424/form1-validate-is-not-a-function
[11:51:15] <jgspratt> (using jzaefferer-jquery-validation)
[11:51:48] <geekbuntu> anyone know of a way to programatically test a json string before writing it to db?
[11:52:22] <cognominal> given a offset text, is there an easy way to find the element that contains that part of text?
[11:52:36] <cognominal> *offset in text
[11:52:48] <geekbuntu> in js or another lang?
[11:52:52] <geekbuntu> php is strpos
[11:53:02] <geekbuntu> python is list disection
[11:56:07] <gnarf> geekbuntu: test a json string?
[11:56:08] <jgspratt> pull through for me here, guys?
[11:56:15] <gnarf> geekbuntu: like make sure its valid json?
[11:56:17] <geekbuntu> ye sir mr gnarf
[11:56:27] <gnarf> jsonlint ?
[11:56:40] <geekbuntu> user input is being compiled via a form into json - then written
[11:56:54] <geekbuntu> sometimes when i call it - it's bad - woul dlike to test it before trying to render it
[11:56:59] <gnarf> https://github.com/zaach/jsonlint
[11:57:00] <geekbuntu> can i run jsonlint cli?
[11:57:08] <gnarf> its pure js
[11:57:10] <geekbuntu> i know you do a lot of php gnarf
[11:57:13] <gnarf> it can run in node
[11:57:14] <geekbuntu> ah
[11:57:23] <geekbuntu> i run nginx
[11:57:24] <geekbuntu> :-D
[11:57:26] <shesek> geekbuntu, why pass JSON from the client-side instead of building it on the server side?
[11:57:57] <geekbuntu> i write static files for response sake
[11:57:57] <gnarf> geekbuntu: whats the server side lang?
[11:58:04] <geekbuntu> today is php
[11:58:12] <gnarf> json_decode it
[11:58:19] <gnarf> and verify format
[11:58:24] <geekbuntu> then reencode it
[11:58:26] <geekbuntu> nice
[11:58:29] <geekbuntu> glad i asked
[11:58:31] <geekbuntu> thanks man
[11:58:38] <geekbuntu> i'll get an error if it's sh*t
[11:58:39] <geekbuntu> :-D
[11:58:59] <gnarf> actually no error
[11:59:01] <gnarf> just "null" :)
[11:59:07] <geekbuntu> i can test for null
[11:59:20] <geekbuntu> and not serve it if it's fubar
[11:59:43] <shesek> no need to re-encode it, just use the original string after you succesfuly decoded it
[11:59:49] <gnarf> http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.json-last-error.php
[12:00:17] <geekbuntu> cool - thanks man
[12:00:26] <geekbuntu> u2 shesek
[12:02:45] * gnarf sighs
[12:04:02] <sanduz2> around the net i see a lot of people using this pop up window that sort of makes the background dark and it brings a new window to the front with a little X on the top right to close it. they all look the same so im guessing its some sort of function or plugin. anyone know what it is?
[12:04:22] <Blegh_> lightbox
[12:04:39] <geekbuntu> sup gnarf?
[12:04:55] <sanduz2> thank you Blegh_
[12:04:59] <gnarf> my last two 1.7 blockers are proving to be big code
[12:04:59] <Dave_Stein> sanduz2 fancybox is a popular jquery one
[12:05:01] <geekbuntu> if you're a woman, a sigh means men are idiots
[12:05:04] <geekbuntu> ah
[12:05:08] <pachet> ProLoser|Work: sorry for the late response, got swamped with work myself ;o
[12:05:40] <sanduz2> thank you Dave_Stein
[12:06:07] <geekbuntu> if you google for it - be sure to say jquery+lightbox
[12:06:12] <geekbuntu> only a couple use jquery
[12:12:44] <Zer000> hey guys, i'd like to know a way to wait for my page to load a new image, then fade out an existing image and fade in the new one. I only want it to display the new one when its loaded. What's the best way to do that?
[12:14:54] <gnarf> ?imagesLoaded
[12:14:55] <bot-t> imagesLoaded() jquery plugin  Gist - https://gist.github.com/268257
[12:15:24] <gnarf> although thats not the ideal answer
[12:15:48] <gnarf> you could easily take the load events concept and create an <img> tag and attach those events to it
[12:15:55] <gnarf> just be sure to read the caveats of load events
[12:19:50] <Znow> Hi, im using NivoSlider... I want to show text beside the image, but still with the fade effect, so when it changes, a new image with text shows up, is that possible?
[12:20:12] <Zer000> gnarf ok ty
[12:21:03] <Zer000> gnarf,  what if i create a hidden loading area, load the pic there, then once it loads transfer it to my needed div?
[12:21:58] <gnarf> Zer000: $("<img>").attr(src, url).imagesLoaded(function() { $(this).appendTo("#mydiv") }); would prolly work fine
[12:27:52] <tooter> hey folks - am i correct in thinking $('ul#mainNav > li') should only return the first level of li's and not those within child lists (in this case ul#mainNav > li > div > ul > li) ? plz :)
[12:28:10] <eddiemonge> tooter: right
[12:28:38] <jeffsmykil> anyone tell me why this is moving an element on a page down instead of up?
[12:28:39] <jeffsmykil> http://pastebin.com/m6iyvkEu
[12:28:46] <tooter> eddiemonge - merde! that mean's i have done something else wrong :D
[12:29:40] <ProLoser|Work> pachet: we all do, np
[12:32:13] <jeffsmykil> anyone, this is might send me to the looney bin
[12:33:37] <enjoycrf> wats the problem
[12:33:57] <jeffsmykil> that is making the box go down
[12:33:58] <jeffsmykil> not up
[12:33:59] <asidjazz> ok so im bringing a bunch of html in via ajax .. then i throw it in a div w/ .html() .. then i loop thorugh elements in that div and try to do stuff .. should i be able to?
[12:34:43] <jeffsmykil> enjoycrf: the left and right buttons formatted the same way work fine
[12:34:50] <jeffsmykil> up and down, not so much
[12:34:54] <enjoycrf> because ur doing top not margin-top
[12:34:54] <tooter> can anyone take a look at http://jsfiddle.net/qxd3T/3 plz and tell me why the mouseover call is being fired on the second level child li's plz?
[12:35:13] <asidjazz> urmom-top
[12:35:23] <jeffsmykil> yes, I realize my variable is poorly named
[12:36:12] <jeffsmykil> enjoycrf:
[12:36:12] <jeffsmykil> http://pastebin.com/ExX123Xy
[12:36:20] <jeffsmykil> left and right work fine
[12:36:31] <jeffsmykil> top and bottom go by strange numbers and top goes down
[12:38:38] <enjoycrf> maybe not the way animate works
[12:39:03] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: you realize a) that you're calling $( this ).attr( "id" ) like 4 times
[12:39:04] <jeffsmykil> so it works differently for left and right then it does top and bottom?
[12:39:09] <gnarf> and you don't need to even call it once?
[12:39:21] <gnarf> this.id
[12:39:24] <gnarf> win
[12:39:44] <jeffsmykil> that would be shorter
[12:40:00] <gnarf> way faster too
[12:40:04] <gnarf> 2 less function calls
[12:40:22] <gnarf> you even had stored the id in a var
[12:40:27] <gnarf> but still called it 4 more times
[12:40:38] <gnarf> so 5 times
[12:40:40] <gnarf> :)
[12:41:05] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: can you put up a fiddle demo?
[12:41:25] <gnarf> tooter: use mouseenter
[12:41:34] <gnarf> tooter: its like mouseover but it doesn't bubble
[12:42:03] <gnarf> you're catching the mouseover from the child LI because you catch mouseovers from all children elements
[12:42:20] <asidjazz> ok so im bringing a bunch of html in via ajax .. then i throw it in a div w/ .html() .. then i loop thorugh elements in that div and try to do stuff and im getting blank objects.. .html() for each of them is gone..
[12:42:42] <gnarf> ?p @asidjazz
[12:42:43] <bot-t> asidjazz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:42:46] <tooter> ahhh - gnarf - thanks!! that makes sense! :)
[12:42:54] <jeffsmykil> gnarf: for you I would love to make a fiddle
[12:42:56] <gnarf> tooter: check e.target btw
[12:42:58] <jeffsmykil> can you give eme ten minutes?
[12:43:02] <gnarf> jeffsmykil: sure

[12:51:43] <Haputanlas> Hello, I'm trying to use an accordion within a specific tab (JQueryUI). I seem to be getting some graphic glitches. Is it possible to nest an accordion within a tab's content?
[12:52:30] <cloke> anyone on that has a good understanding of draggables internals? Trying to address an issue when the parent element is scaled via CSS
[12:53:15] <jeffsmykil> do i need the document ready in a fiddle?
[12:54:44] <Kzim> hi
[12:55:38] <Kzim> i try the query ui dialog() but i $('div').load('/test').dialog() and in /test there is javascript in it and it's working outside the dialog but not in the dialog
[12:55:39] <Zer000> geekbuntu, it was in chrome. i dunno what gives
[12:57:54] <Dave_Stein> cloke i know draggable somewhat because of the hate i have for it and interactions
[12:58:05] <Dave_Stein> cloke what do you mean by scaled?
[12:58:05] <Haputanlas> Answered my own question. To nest an accordion within a tab, you need to initialize the #accordion code before the #tab code. Not sure why.
[12:58:18] <Dave_Stein> Haputanlas because interactions are real glitchy in UI
[12:58:47] <Haputanlas> Interesting. At least it's working now. Thanks Dave_Stein!
[12:58:49] <jeffsmykil> gnarf:  almost done
[12:59:05] <cloke> dave_stein: The containing element has a transform: scale(.5) or some factor. When I drag something around it seems to not realize the parent is scaled.
[12:59:41] <Dave_Stein> cloke so the over callbackis being thrown based on the old coordinates? if so i do have answer for that
[13:00:50] <Dave_Stein> $.ui.ddmanager.prepareOffsets( $('.ui-draggable').data('draggable'), e );
[13:01:08] <cloke> dave_stein: well if I am dragging at a scale of like .2 I have to drag my mouse really far and then if I click on the element again for a drag it snaps back to the unscaled coordinates.
[13:01:09] <Dave_Stein> cloke that forces a refresh so if the parent is 100x100 and then 50x50, draggable will now know its not over the parent
[13:01:42] <Dave_Stein> so if you run that after the size changes you should be good
[13:01:58] <Dave_Stein> of course youd wanna target the draggable instead of using the class or youd be recalculating a lot at once potentially
[13:02:49] <cloke> and e is the dragging element or the container that was scaled?
[13:03:01] <Dave_Stein> sorry e is the event
[13:03:42] <Dave_Stein> here is a good example:
[13:03:42] <Dave_Stein> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/725938/js-jquery-dragndrop-recalculate-the-drop-targets
[13:03:52] <Dave_Stein> and .prepareOffset
[13:03:55] <Dave_Stein> er wrong copy paste
[13:03:58] <Dave_Stein> http://rubberflat.com/2010/06/refresh-jquery-ui-droppable-area-after-shifting-position/
[13:05:13] <cloke> cool, I'll give that a try
[13:06:05] <tooter> gnarf - sorry, so I've checked e.target, think i got the angle but end up with http://jsfiddle.net/qxd3T/6/ - it almost works, mouseenter the menu - it shows, but the mouseleave i seem to have got wrong :)
[13:06:14] <tooter> or rather misunderstood

[13:16:03] <jeffsmykil> no I meant the +=
[13:16:13] <Eviltwin> I know
[13:16:16] <jeffsmykil> and thank you
[13:16:24] <Eviltwin> You may have needed .offset() instead of .position()
[13:16:27] <Eviltwin> Or something
[13:16:30] <Eviltwin> But w/e this works
[13:16:48] <jeffsmykil> would you mind explaining to me the +=10 -+10
[13:17:13] <Eviltwin> Well in a lot of programming languages, a = a + 5 can be abbreviated as a += 5
[13:17:22] <Eviltwin> jQuery recognizes this syntax here
[13:17:31] <Eviltwin> As meaning you want to take the value and adjust it by this amount
[13:17:45] <jeffsmykil> brilliant
[13:17:54] <jeffsmykil> I <3 you even if you are the eviltwin
[13:17:59] <Eviltwin> Hah, thanks
[13:18:54] <pachet> ProLoser|Work: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl
[13:20:18] <jeffsmykil> i assume you are diabolically evil and not evil evil
[13:20:42] <Eviltwin> Something like that
[13:21:02] <jeffsmykil> you aren't hurting puppies and the such...
[13:21:12] <Eviltwin> No, only larger mammals
[13:21:20] <KicStart42> Mmmm puppies
[13:21:23] <jacof> ('#id').load() replaces the whole contents of #id right
[13:21:31] <pachet> anything smaller than a cart ox isn't "worth it"
[13:21:37] <jacof> so what if i wanted to .prepend a loaded page
[13:21:48] <jacof> i should have to create a blank div and prepend it and then load ?
[13:22:04] <Eviltwin> jacof: Yeah or use .get/.ajax and .html
[13:22:10] <pachet> ?.get @ jacof
[13:22:11] <jacof> like this ? ('#id').prepend('.div').load('page.html #somewhat'); ?
[13:22:12] <bot-t> jacof, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[13:22:23] <Eviltwin> .prepend insead of .html
[13:23:23] <jacof> ok thnx
[13:23:24] * jeffsmykil hugs eviltwin
[13:23:36] <jeffsmykil> it works in mai kode thankz us
[13:24:03] <Eviltwin> jeffsmykil: You're tempting my homicidal instincts
[13:24:13] <jeffsmykil> meh, I've had a good run
[13:24:18] <jeffsmykil> made it to 31
[13:24:52] <Dovoto> how do i use this pastebin? :)  http://jsfiddle.net/sB37w/  (specifically, how do i attache the onclick event to the javascript?)
[13:25:48] <D_yne> hello
[13:26:26] <D_yne> how r you guyz ?
[13:26:35] <jacof> so, and what if I wanted to load two divs from a different page
[13:26:47] <jacof> should I first wrap em and then load the wrapper
[13:26:50] <jacof> do it sequentially
[13:26:51] <jacof> or what
[13:27:48] <pachet> $.get('foo.html',function(data){ $('#id').append($('.bar', data));
[13:28:01] <pachet> * });
[13:28:10] <pachet> where foo is your page, and bar is the selector for the divs
[13:28:38] <tooter> gnarf - i case ya read back. thanks for the help -sorted :)
[13:28:50] <pachet> some of these answers, i can just start making hotkeys
[13:28:53] <pachet> i feel like bot-t
[13:28:55] <pachet> ?bot-t
[13:28:56] <bot-t> sentient but living in the machine locale.
[13:28:59] <pachet> awye
[13:29:12] <jacof> a cool
[13:29:12] <jacof> thnks
[13:29:58] <jacof> so why get and not load
[13:30:08] <pachet> load is brute force
[13:30:15] <pachet> forces the returned content into your container
[13:30:16] <jacof> what do you mena
[13:30:27] <jacof> and get what does do
[13:30:34] <pachet> get allows you to filter the returned values first
[13:30:57] <pachet> so you can be a little more selective ;3
[13:31:29] <pachet> returned values? returned data
[13:31:33] <pachet> rather
[13:31:59] <jacof> what does .bar do in this case ?
[13:32:08] <jacof> its the div that's gonna hold the imkported data ?
[13:33:04] <pachet> .bar is the selector you want to include from the page
[13:34:21] <fission6> will this set all input form fields with name='next' to have a value of current pathname?  $("input[name='next']").attr('value', window.location.pathname)
[13:34:25] <jacof> 			jQuery.get('/ #header',function(data){ jQuery('div.container > div.header').append(data)});
[13:34:26] <jacof> good ?
[13:35:31] <pachet> fission6: you should use .val() instead
[13:35:37] <fission6> k
[13:35:39] <fission6> thanks pachet
[13:36:18] <jacof> or i cant target a specific portion of the page with .get
[13:36:52] <Dovoto> okay, figured it out...anyway, any thoughts on making this: http://jsfiddle.net/sB37w/1/  do what i want?
[13:37:37] <Dovoto> it seems to work except they dont fade back in (they are properly swapped in the dom)
[13:39:01] <pachet> jacof: not like that ;o the xhr is going to return you the entire page, regardless of whether you include a hash or not. that's just for your browser to set the position of the viewport, it doesnt have any effect on the data returned
[13:40:04] <jacof> huh
[13:40:27] <jacof> pachet... so .. how the heck do I load just the header and the menu from the main site and import it into the second site ?
[13:43:09] <pachet> $('.target-div').append($('.header', data));
[13:43:42] <jacof> alright cool. but the header is coming out without any styling just HTML.. I didn't see that coming
[13:43:53] <jacof> but it makes absolute sense though
[13:44:45] <Eviltwin> Dovoto: You need to fade the clones
[13:44:58] <Dovoto> evil that almost works
[13:45:47] <Dovoto> if i click update does it update what you see?
[13:46:50] <Dovoto> i guess not
[13:47:38] <Eviltwin> The rest of your problem is because you're waiting on the second animation and not the first
[13:47:48] <Dovoto> hmm
[13:47:52] <Eviltwin> So technically the element may not be done fading yet
[13:48:02] <Eviltwin> I'm trying to come up with a simple solution that's not a hack
[13:48:39] <Dovoto> k, thinking on it
[13:50:25] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/sB37w/3/'
[13:50:27] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/sB37w/3/
[13:50:29] <Eviltwin> There
[13:50:37] <Eviltwin> That waits for both now
[13:51:26] <daum_> hey guys - i'm trying to make sure all radio button groups on a page (which are visible) are checked, what is the best way to do that?
[13:51:45] <daum_> for all the other inptus i do a filter like select:visible, input:visible
[13:51:50] <cnnr> i'm having trouble getting $('#nav li a.someClass').trigger('click'); to work on iOS. does it not work on mobile?
[13:52:15] <Dovoto> evil...hmm  very interesting.  Thank you, that gives a bit to research
[13:52:19] <jeffsmykil> i think there is a jquery mobile irc room if im not mistaken
[13:53:14] <cnnr> i'm not using jquery mobile
[13:53:16] <jeffsmykil> that being said im mistaken more often then not
[13:53:22] <cnnr> i'd prefer not to
[13:53:48] <jeffsmykil> i know .click() doesn;'t work on iOS
[13:53:57] <cnnr> grr
[13:53:58] <cnnr> ok thanks
[13:54:17] <jeffsmykil> well I was going to say something after that
[13:54:23] <jeffsmykil> but never mind lol
[13:54:40] <pachet> daum_:
[13:54:47] <pachet> var radioFlag=true; $("form input:radio").each(function(){if($(this).is(':checked'))radioFlag=false;});
[13:55:07] <pachet> er, that should be if(!$(this...
[13:55:19] <daum_> pachet, well wouldn't that require them all to be checked?
[13:55:33] <daum_> if we have 4 radios buttons, and 2 differnet groups we'd need 1 from each group checked
[13:56:44] <Dovoto> okay, that makes a lot of sense.  I was looking at $.promise() and trying to figure out how to make that work.
[13:56:58] <Dovoto> evil, why "then" and not "done" ?
[13:57:12] <jeffsmykil> Dovoto: http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[13:57:44] <KicStart42> jeff:Click isn't handled as a touch event?
[13:58:13] <jeffsmykil> KicStart42: doesnt work for me, but i havent looked much into it yet
[13:58:20] <jeffsmykil> probably next week is when i will tackle it
[13:58:54] <Dovoto> jeff, very helpful
[14:02:10] <jeffsmykil> Dovoto you should thank erichynds he wrote it!
[14:03:04] <Dovoto> well look at that, in my defense the user list is 875 long ;)
[14:06:02] <Dovoto> okay, back to my jscript inneptitude.  Is there a better way to move those objects other than a deep copy and replaceWith?
[14:15:10] <snurfery> question about jquery form validation, e.g. validate()
[14:15:31] <snurfery> the docs say that I can use a remote script to validate data, such as making sure an email address isn't already taken
[14:15:51] <snurfery> the docs also say I can return true, false/null/undefined, OR an error string
[14:16:26] <snurfery> I want to return a specific error string, but have no idea how to access it from validate()
[14:17:06] <snurfery> I've seen several people looking for similar info online, but no solutions
[14:18:22] <Dovoto> thanks for the help evil,jeff (and erichynds of course).
[14:18:24] * Dovoto idles
[14:25:00] <crankharder> I need to swap out a select field for a text field -- they both need to pass the same parameter.  I know the the last one in the form will take presendence... so whats the best practice there? show/hide them and switch their order or something else?
[14:25:25] <crankharder> i need to swap them back and forth, so nothing destructive here
[14:26:47] <Eviltwin> crankharder: Probably hide/show
[14:29:03] <crankharder> ...except hidden fields still pass their values
[14:29:33] <erichynds> toggle the disabled attribute
[14:29:36] <erichynds> property, rather
[14:31:26] <crankharder> attr('disabled', true) and attr('disabled', 'disabled') both dont stop it from submitting
[14:31:49] <erichynds> prop("disabled", true)
[14:35:03] <kinga> hey there guys, could you help me with this ? http://pastebin.com/yMuY7wha
[14:35:26] <kinga> the problem is simple, that part of the code is not being executed in order
[14:36:04] <jedimind> thats not exactly a problem so much as common sense...
[14:36:20] <kinga> it's async: 'false'
[14:36:23] <kinga> please explain
[14:36:47] <jedimind> well your ajax call needs time to call the server and come back, and the success doesnt trigger until it gets a response obviously
[14:36:52] <jedimind> where as the rest of your js keeps going
[14:36:53] <kinga> changehash is in global scope
[14:37:13] <kinga> but its SYNC, why doesn't it wait ?
[14:37:20] <kinga> that's why i specified it
[14:39:33] <mwillhite> anyone here have experience with jquery datatables? I'm having sorting issues…
[14:39:46] <kinga> if i'm doing it wrong, could please aid me in the right direction ?
[14:40:18] <jedimind> kinga, whatever you need to do with the returned data, you have to do it in the ajax callback
[14:41:05] <kinga> ok, i'll try something
[14:41:11] <kinga> but what's the point of async then ?
[14:41:21] <jedimind> it doesnt mean what you think it means :)
[14:41:23] <kinga> i know what sync and async does
[14:41:29] <kinga> as words
[14:42:03] <jedimind> the asynchronous ajax and xml request is a function by itself, the way that javascript processes things is that it just goes down and runs things that are in the parent level
[14:42:23] <jedimind> the functions get triggered in order, but do not wait for the previous function to complete
[14:42:27] <jedimind> prior to triggering
[14:43:23] <kinga> ah, ok i understand
[14:43:33] <kinga> and yes, now it works, i fixed it
[14:44:00] <jedimind> cool, glad you figured out wtf i was saying because i dont have time to re-explain lol
[14:47:00] <tktiddle> how do i submit form using ajax?
[14:47:24] <mwillhite> tktiddle: you can do it a couple of ways…
[14:47:31] <mwillhite> you can do $(form).submit()
[14:47:54] <mwillhite> or you can trigger a click on the submit button $(':submit', form).click()
[14:48:13] <mwillhite> depends on how you have your form set up and your specific requirements
[14:48:26] <tktiddle> cool thanks mwillhite
[14:48:32] <jedimind> that is only the submit event of the form, that wont actually submit it using ajax
[14:48:43] <jedimind> within that submit event, you'll have to use $.post or $.ajax
[14:48:47] <jedimind> read up how on docs.jquery.com
[14:48:56] <mwillhite> yeah, good point jedimind
[14:49:20] <mwillhite> I misread the question, I told you how to submit your form with javascript/jquery
[14:49:36] <mwillhite> but it won't submit it asynchronously
[14:49:46] <jedimind> also, "using ajax" is not entirely accurate, but i digress
[14:49:54] <mwillhite> L)
[14:49:57] <jedimind> submit a form using an xhr :)
[14:49:57] <mwillhite> :)
[14:50:28] <fission6> why when a link is clicked and i .show a div, does firefox scroll back up to the top?
[14:50:39] <jedimind> because your link has a # in it ?
[14:50:49] <fission6> ha funny, i just realized that and removed it
[14:50:51] <fission6> still does it
[14:50:58] <mwillhite> and you aren't using e.preventDefault() on the link
[14:51:01] <mwillhite> ?
[14:51:03] <jedimind> it should have a fallback for a non-js version of whatever you're doing
[14:51:08] <jedimind> and then add .... what mwillhite said
[14:51:15] <jedimind> function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }
[14:51:51] <fission6> mwillhite, jedimind, http://dpaste.org/WWFKe/
[14:52:16] <jedimind> because you're not passing the event into the function
[14:52:20] <jedimind> function(event) { ... }
[14:52:22] <mwillhite> yep
[14:52:52] <muzone> I'm trying to create a jQuery world map at http://home.no/dwaynie/map using SVGZ (for greater detail) - but I'm having some trouble getting the SVGZ extracted. Might you guys know what to do?
[14:53:43] <fission6> jedimind, thanks
[14:53:51] <jedimind> tar zxvf map.svfz
[14:54:06] <jedimind> fission6, np
[14:55:02] <jedimind> muzone, are you grabbing the svgz file directly from wikipedia?
[14:55:40] <muzone> jedimind: no sir
[14:55:41] <ngharo> i doubt tar would work on svgz.  you probably just want to gunzip it
[14:55:52] <jedimind> i was trying to make a joke ngharo
[14:56:07] <jedimind> muzone, your server might not have the right mime type set for svgz
[14:56:33] <jedimind> either that or your data return from $ajax doesnt know how to parse the file because it's expecting a json object or something
[14:56:35] <jedimind> just guessing
[15:14:33] <enjoycrf> hai hai hai
[15:14:46] <VIRGOFX_> hai
[15:15:03] <enjoycrf> is there quick way to collect a url hash w jquery
[15:15:55] <multipass|2> for colorbox, does anyone know how i can use a jquery target? im trying to do something like this, but its not working -- href:$(this).parent().find('.projectPopz')}
[15:17:25] <enjoycrf> window.location.hash
[15:17:32] <Janhouse> what is the best way to remove all but last 500 elements in some container
[15:17:36] <enjoycrf> is that crossbrowser
[15:17:47] <Janhouse> ?
[15:18:07] <enjoycrf> u have to do it manually
[15:18:10] <LakWork> any advice on how i can avoid triggering a popup blocker with an window that appears automatically on page load after the user is redirected to a certain url?
[15:18:23] <LakWork> (general js question)
[15:18:59] <enjoycrf> or encapsulate the elemnts to not be removed in a span
[15:19:25] <Janhouse> it is like log viewer that gets new data from stream
[15:19:41] <Janhouse> so I want it to keep only last x lines
[15:19:48] <Janhouse> or else the page can get really slow
[15:39:06] <uchuff> Janhouse: can't you keep a count and when you hit 500 just delete the last one?
[15:39:27] <Janhouse> already figure
[15:39:30] <Janhouse> d
[15:39:42] <Janhouse> thx
[15:42:18] <Janhouse> can I force stop loading $.post request?

[15:50:48] <Travis-42> I'm using the jquery validate method and I have some forms that is dynamically loaded, but the validate() method is set up as a bind, rather than live (e.g. it won't detect new forms matching the selector) is this possible, or do I have to readd validate() every time the form is dynamically created?
[15:56:41] <zjk> can i do this ? 'li ul.children li[class^="current-cat"] ul'
[16:00:04] <ravenzz> zjk yes, do you have nested ul?
[16:00:36] <zjk> yes and i use this in a selector to catch <li class="current-cat-whatever"
[16:01:41] <ravenzz> ok then try it an see

[16:38:08] <eddiemonge> quiet today
[16:38:46] <dlam> ill make it less quiet
[16:38:49] <dlam> given some element, how do i simulate a 'enter' press in it?
[16:38:55] <dlam> i wanna do like $(someinputbox).hitEnter()
[16:39:15] <thansen> I'll help by making it louder :)
[16:39:37] <eddiemonge> ?keypress @ dlam
[16:39:38] <bot-t> dlam, .keypress(handler): Bind an event handler to the "keypress" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/keypress/
[16:39:46] <thansen> kinda new to jquery and I have some code jQuery("a.toggle_switch").click(function(o){
[16:40:17] <thansen> inside the function I have console.log(jQuery(this).nextAll());
[16:40:32] <thansen> and no matter what I do that returns nothing for me :(
[16:40:39] <thansen> what am I doing wrong?
[16:41:31] <eddiemonge> thansen: what does console.log( jQuery(this).next() ) give you?
[16:41:39] <thansen> []
[16:41:55] <mwillhite> thansen: an example of the dom you are trying to crawl may help
[16:41:58] <thansen> all of them give me nothing :(
[16:42:18] <mwillhite> if you do console.log('foo'), does it print 'foo'?
[16:42:24] <thansen> yeah
[16:42:26] <eddiemonge> thansen: then your anchor tag doesnt have any siblings after it
[16:42:40] <eddiemonge> paste your html markup at jsfiddle.net
[16:42:45] <Aquaguy> Hey
[16:42:55] <Aquaguy> is there anything like .resize() for a div?
[16:43:17] <Aquaguy> I want to execute a piece of code when a certain div gets resized
[16:44:15] <thansen> eddiemonge: ok, I'm using the wrong method then, I just tested a different scenario
[16:44:46] <thansen> how do I find the next element in the dom (sibling or not) which meets a specific criteria?
[16:45:11] <mwillhite> .next([criteria])
[16:45:13] <mwillhite> I believe…
[16:45:23] <jimubao> hey just wondering how can i get value of an inputfield
[16:45:35] <thansen> mwillhite: well, that's what I suspected, but no go
[16:45:38] <eddiemonge> Aquaguy: have you looked at http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-resize-plugin/ ?
[16:45:47] <mwillhite> jimubao: field.val()
[16:46:09] <jimubao> <input type="text" name="name" value="sdfsdf_04.js" id="row1">
[16:46:14] <eddiemonge> thansen: html markup of what you have and what you want would be helpful
[16:46:16] <mwillhite> thansen: thats what the docs describe: http://api.jquery.com/next/

[16:47:05] <jimubao> what is the diff btw val and value

[16:48:17] <thansen> so it's not really a sibling I suppose
[16:48:59] <eddiemonge> jimubao: value is the pure javascript way and .val() is the jquery way. with the pure js way you need to select the actual dom element and not the jquery object representation of it
[16:49:49] <jimubao> thanks eddiemonge
[16:50:07] <eddiemonge> thansen: nope, not at all
[16:50:24] <thansen> is there a function to get the next one in that case?
[16:50:39] <mwillhite> thansen, nextAll didn't work?
[16:50:49] <thansen> nope
[16:51:14] <mwillhite> oh didn't see your snippet
[16:51:36] <jimubao> ?find
[16:51:36] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[16:52:53] <eddiemonge> thansen: you would have to do something like .closest('table').next() if that was your actual markup but it doesnt sound like your markup is setup correctly
[16:53:19] <eddiemonge> why do you have an anchor tag that is a UI control in a table anyway?
[16:53:40] * thansen knew that was coming :)
[16:54:52] <thansen> old code is all I can say :(  anyway, I gotta jet for a bit but thanks for the help/pointers...I'll probably be back in a few hours
[17:04:13] <ChrisPitzer> hey =
[17:04:22] <ChrisPitzer> are any people in here requirejs users?
[17:05:06] <jimubao> <li><input type="text" value="James.swf"><input type="text" value="James.pdf"><input type="text" value="James.mp3"></li> ....$('input').attr('value').val() will only return James.swf
[17:05:26] <jimubao> how do i grab rest of value ?
[17:05:56] <Eviltwin> jimubao: $('input').map(function(){return $(this).val()})
[17:06:09] <eddiemonge> jimubao: why are you doing $('input').attr('value').val()?  the .attr('value') part isnt doing anything
[17:06:54] <jimubao> eddiemonge: coz i wanna grab the value from attribute value
[17:07:03] <jimubao> am i not doing it correctly ?
[17:07:28] <eddiemonge> jimubao: no. all you need is .val()
[17:07:40] <asidjazz> so what do i do about trying to manipulate html brought in via ajax?
[17:07:40] <eddiemonge> $('ele').val()
[17:07:45] <asidjazz> is there some kind of trick?
[17:07:57] <jimubao> Eviltwin: i will try look into .map thanks
[17:07:59] <eddiemonge> asidjazz: $(data).find('ele')
[17:08:23] <Eviltwin> ? .map @ jimubao
[17:08:24] <bot-t> jimubao, .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[17:08:49] <jimubao> eddiemonge: thanks for the tip, very new to jQuery
[17:09:04] <eddiemonge> ?getting started @ jimubao
[17:09:06] <bot-t> jimubao, Tutorials:Getting Started with jQuery - Goes through the basics of jQuery, all the way up to building plugins. http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery
[17:09:12] <eddiemonge> try that ^^
[17:09:21] <Eviltwin> You may need to .get() afterwards
[17:09:26] <asidjazz> eddiemonge: what about if i've put it somewhere via .html and need to find something via classname?
[17:09:40] <eddiemonge> asidjazz: did wha?
[17:09:51] <eddiemonge> wha
[17:09:55] <asidjazz> ok so likes say i have <div class="eddiemonge"></div>
[17:10:00] <asidjazz> and i get that via ajax
[17:10:02] <jimubao> awsome will do some readings now ~
[17:10:15] <asidjazz> and i $('.bob').html(htmlfromajaxw/thatdiv);
[17:10:28] <asidjazz> if i $('.eddiemong').hide(); $('.eddiemonge').fadeIn()
[17:10:33] <asidjazz> i get nothing
[17:10:45] <ekkis> greetings everyone.  if I have a jquery object, I can create a method for it like this, no? $(o).mymethod = function() {}
[17:10:52] <eddiemonge> asidjazz: are you doing that line after the ajax call in the success callback?
[17:10:58] <asidjazz> eddiemonge: yes
[17:11:06] <eddiemonge> ?pe @ asidjazz
[17:11:07] <bot-t> asidjazz, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ otherwise I won't look at it.
[17:11:13] <asidjazz> im doing a .html() and then referencing
[17:11:14] <asidjazz> ok
[17:11:23] <eddiemonge> ekkis: for what purpose?
[17:11:52] <ekkis> eddiemonge: so I can call it later like this: $(o).mymethod()
[17:12:00] <asidjazz> eddiemonge: http://pastebin.com/C1p51uVu
[17:12:16] <Eviltwin> ekkis: No, you can't do that
[17:12:23] <Eviltwin> However you can make all jQuery objects have your new method
[17:12:29] <eddiemonge> ?writing plugins @ ekkis
[17:12:29] <Eviltwin> By doing $.fn.mymethod = function() {}
[17:12:30] <bot-t> ekkis, Plugins/Authoring - jQuery offers a mechanism for adding in methods and functionality, bundled as plugins. Most of the methods and functions included in the default download are written using the jQuery plugin construct. http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[17:12:51] <ekkis> Eviltwin: I don't want all jquery objects to have my method, only the object in question
[17:13:16] <eddiemonge> asidjazz: ugh. guess you didnt read the second part of that bott message
[17:13:16] <Eviltwin> ekkis: var o = $("input"); o.mymethod = function() { ... }; o.mymethod() works
[17:13:30] <asidjazz> second part?
[17:13:33] <Eviltwin> $("input").mymethod = function() { ... }; $("input").mymethod() will not work
[17:13:45] <Eviltwin> Understand?
[17:13:54] <ekkis> hmm...
[17:14:00] <Eviltwin> Those two calls to $("input") represent two completely different objects
[17:14:25] <ekkis> Eviltwin: they do?
[17:14:28] <Eviltwin> Yes
[17:14:34] <Eviltwin> That call is a function
[17:14:43] <Eviltwin> It produces a new function
[17:14:44] <ekkis> they represent a reference to a collection of objects... in the same context it would be the same collection
[17:14:47] <Eviltwin> With a copy of the elements it represents
[17:15:02] <Eviltwin> Not exactly
[17:15:18] <eddiemonge> asidjazz: does http://jsfiddle.net/YHyQv/ give you the html you think you want from the response?
[17:15:26] <Eviltwin> var a = $("input"); $("input:eq(0)").remove(); var b = $("input");
[17:15:36] <Eviltwin> a will have the removed element and b will not
[17:15:37] <ekkis> Eviltwin: oh... it's a copy
[17:16:08] <Eviltwin> Put most simply, yes
[17:16:16] <Eviltwin> But it's a copy for a lot of other more important reasons
[17:16:50] <ekkis> Eviltwin: ok, that alters my understanding of this issue.  I think I can see my way clear now.  I'm writing a plugin... I changed the structure a bit and broke it and didn't get why
[17:17:19] <eddiemonge> ekkis: did you read that plugin doc?
[17:17:22] <Eviltwin> The jQuery Widget interface is really cool
[17:17:32] <Eviltwin> Will track this state for you if you use it correctly
[17:17:34] <Eviltwin> Read the doc
[17:17:36] <ekkis> eddiemonge: I did, however what I want to do is a bit different
[17:18:02] <Eviltwin> It uses the .data() to track a single state object for a given element
[17:18:10] <ekkis> Eviltwin: it is, I used it before for other plugins but there were things about its structure I did not completely understand... but I'm getting there
[17:18:29] <Eviltwin> It's kind of hard to understand the decisions they made at first
[17:18:48] <Eviltwin> But it's actually really cool.
[17:18:50] <Eviltwin> Really powerful
[17:19:35] <ekkis> I think as one grows in sophistication things we gloss over before become more important to understand
[17:19:46] <eddiemonge> ekkis: so what are you trying to do exactly?
[17:19:57] <jimubao> ?this
[17:19:57] <bot-t> my code, http://jsfiddle.net/rTus6/
[17:20:36] <ekkis> eddiemonge: well, this little plugin is supposed to enhance images with a bunch of functionality so they can behave in a specific way, namely to act as buttons
[17:20:58] <ekkis> so it gives me the choice to toggle/enable/disable/set titles, etc.
[17:21:10] <asidjazz> eddiemonge: let me se.. what did you do different?
[17:21:51] <asidjazz> eddiemonge: oh you lol added a console.log(response.html); :)
[17:21:59] <asidjazz> eddiemonge: yea man i already tested all taht :)
[17:22:55] <asidjazz> eddiemonge: so first off are you saying i should be able to manipulate elements in html brought in from ajax?
[17:23:04] <eddiemonge> ekkis: and why cant you do that as a plugin?
[17:23:19] <eddiemonge> asidjazz: yes. a live link would help
[17:23:35] <ekkis> Eviltwin: so I think I understand now... if var o = $("input"); o.mymethod = function() {}; works, it will work only for the context in which o is defined... as soon as we fall out of scope the input will lose its functionality, right?
[17:24:27] <ekkis> eddiemonge: I am doing it as a plugin.  I had something working and now I've broken it and I'm trying to figure out how it worked before
[17:26:45] <ProLoser|Work> anyone here use the template plugin?
[17:26:57] <ProLoser|Work> i found this bug where my data persists across multiple uses of the template function
[17:27:15] <eddiemonge> ekkis: code?
[17:27:45] <jimubao> ?each
[17:27:45] <bot-t> .each(function): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element. http://api.jquery.com/each/
[17:27:49] <ekkis> eddiemonge: I'm reworking it.  let me pastebin when I either get it working or determine I can't get it to work
[17:28:16] <eddiemonge> ugh. stop using pastebin. anything that doesnt let me edit in place and save is worthless
[17:31:11] <ProLoser|Work> lol @ eddiemonge
[17:32:13] <ekkis> eddiemonge: ok, it won't work... here it is in jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/wVEnv/
[17:32:41] <ekkis> eddiemonge: the call to img.disable() fails as it doesn't exist
[17:34:41] <ekkis> eddiemonge: the change I made to the plugin is that it now handles multiple images, which means that I have a return this.each(...) instead of what I used to have: return this;
[17:35:12] <ekkis> because the .each() installs the methods onto an object that gets tossed now, the code breaks
[17:35:13] <eddiemonge> ekkis: you cant call disable directly
[17:35:15] <ProLoser|Work> in templates what is tmplItem?
[17:35:20] <ProLoser|Work> should i be using that instead of $item?
[17:35:34] <ekkis> eddiemonge: I know, I used to be able to do it, when the code worked for only 1 image
[17:36:02] <eddiemonge> you dont want to do it like that because it could overwrite other plugins or builtin jquery methods
[17:36:02] <ekkis> because at that point var img had a copy of the loaded up object
[17:36:17] <ekkis> now img gets whatever this.each() returns
[17:37:11] <eddiemonge> ekkis: read this section http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Namespacing
[17:37:15] <ekkis> eddiemonge: so what what I need to return is a collection of marked-up objects... but how do I do that?
[17:37:19] * ekkis reads
[17:37:23] <melvinram> anyone know of a really good data grid, similar to Google Spreadsheets, but simpler?
[17:37:34] <melvinram> Something like http://nextgensim.info/grids
[17:37:44] <melvinram> Open source or commercial is fine
[17:37:57] <ekkis> eddiemonge: yes, I read that before
[17:38:16] <eddiemonge> ekkis: like i said, read that whole page, it has exactly what you need, although you may have to expand on some of the stuff intro'ed in it
[17:38:33] * ekkis goes back to page
[17:38:37] <eddiemonge> melvinram: jqgrid, extjs
[17:38:53] <eddiemonge> ekkis: it tells you how to incorporate methods into your plugin
[17:39:17] <melvinram> eddiemonge: jqgrid isn't really that smooth from the users perspective. Let me check out extjs.
[17:39:35] <ekkis> yes but the approach is to pass method names as arguments whereas I want to be able to call them directly
[17:39:58] <eddiemonge> why?
[17:40:02] <ekkis> I do understand the rationale for not polluting the namespace but I want to
[17:40:06] <eddiemonge> whats the difference?
[17:40:25] <ekkis> it's more natural to express img.disable() than img.Image('disable')
[17:41:13] <eddiemonge> ben_alman: got any input on this?
[17:41:20] <melvinram> eddiemonge: extjs looks good. thanks.
[17:41:38] <ekkis> I don't want to do $.fn.mymethod because I don't want this method to be available to all jquery objects.  I only want it for the ones for which I called .Image()
[17:42:03] <eddiemonge> melvinram: its license sucks and it has a murky history, especially with jquery but it really is currently the best grid/charting package out there, at least until jqui stuff is done
[17:43:53] <eddiemonge> ekkis: thats how the plugin system works
[17:44:17] <eddiemonge> its like .hide(). its available to all elements but will only actually hide them when called with .hide()
[17:44:27] <eddiemonge> or like how jqueryui works
[17:45:15] <ekkis> eddiemonge: in my previous version, the plugin only handled 1 image... which means it could return the 1 marked-up object and everything was fine... but now the problem is I have a collection of objects and I need to replace the collection of original objects with a collection of marked-up objects
[17:46:01] <geekbuntu> hi - anyone seen any good plugins/tools for creating online reports?
[17:46:54] <eddiemonge> ekkis: exactly what the jquery plugin system is for
[17:47:13] <eddiemonge> geekbuntu: like crytal reports? thats a pretty generic question
[17:47:23] <geekbuntu> eddiemonge, yea - it was weak
[17:47:39] <geekbuntu> but sometimes leaving it open spawns suggestions of things i never would of thought of
[17:48:01] <geekbuntu> i think i want something that can do some charting
[17:48:04] <geekbuntu> pie/bar
[17:48:11] <geekbuntu> with a chocolate shake
[17:48:13] <geekbuntu> and fries
[17:48:15] <geekbuntu> o.0
[17:48:49] <melvinram> eddiemonge: found something that might work as alternative to extjs https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/
[17:49:43] <eddiemonge> i feel like i just answered this question
[17:49:58] <geekbuntu> deja moo?
[17:50:19] <Brak> no mootools
[17:50:50] <melvinram> eddiemonge: me?
[17:50:54] <eddiemonge> geekbuntu jqgrid, extjs
[17:50:57] * geekbuntu deja moo is the sensation you've experienced this bull sh*t before
[17:51:15] <geekbuntu> jqgrid keeps coming up
[17:51:17] <eddiemonge> geekbuntu: melvinram theres also dojo if you want the whole application framework.
[17:51:27] <geekbuntu> i might just suck it up and try it out
[17:51:30] <geekbuntu> thanks eddiemonge
[17:51:46] <ekkis> eddiemonge: but marking up the objects I'm passed within .each() doesn't work because the object gets discarded and I have no way of returning the marked-up objects
[17:52:04] <eddiemonge> ekkis: huh?
[17:52:36] <ekkis> eddiemonge: your last comment was that's what the plugin system is for...
[17:53:18] <eddiemonge> var myPluginGroup = $('img').Image();  now myPluginGroup is a set of jquery objects that have had your plugin group applied to them
[17:53:53] <melvinram> eddiemonge: I think I'll stick with Q
[17:53:58] <melvinram> eddiemonge: I think I'll stick with jQ
[17:54:36] <electronplusplus> HI
[17:54:36] <bot-t> (191 hours ago) <ajpiano> tell electronplusplus http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-monthly-200807-201109
[17:54:56] <ekkis> yes, if I make changes to the objects like setting properties etc, it's fine, but if what I want to do is to end up with a collection of $(o) in myPluginGroup, in other words, I want to replace the list of objects, with a list of jquery objects, then I don't have a good way to do it
[17:55:11] <melvinram> geekbuntu: check out https://github.com/mleibman/SlickGrid/wiki/Examples
[17:55:57] <geekbuntu> melvinram, i'm looking at it now - also jqgrid
[17:56:05] <geekbuntu> it's cool but no charting yet
[17:56:14] <geekbuntu> may be making site for an old dude
[17:56:19] <geekbuntu> (even older than me)
[17:56:22] <geekbuntu> he likes pics
[17:56:34] <melvinram> geekbuntu: jqgrid felt a bit clunky.
[17:56:41] <geekbuntu> it's huge
[17:56:49] <ekkis> eddiemonge: so if inside my .each() I do something like: this.mymethod = function() {} then that will work but the method is attached directly to the object... therefore at some later point I can call it like this: $('img')[0].mymethod() but what I want is to call it like this: $('img').mymethod()
[17:57:17] <geekbuntu> melvinram, anytime i do something for somebody that involves 'number' exce-esque - i wonder if i need the tool with the most documentation
[17:57:38] <eddiemonge> ekkis: you are confusing me (and i think yourself). i feel like you are making this way more complicated than it needs to be
[17:57:58] <ekkis> you're probably right
[17:58:14] <ekkis> if I were happy just calling $('img').Image('mymethod') everything would be fine
[17:58:17] <geekbuntu> ekkis, don't feel bad - that's my life story
[17:58:28] * geekbuntu drive self nuts - drink beer - everything clearer the next day
[17:58:32] <ekkis> but I want to be able to call: var img = $('img').Image(); img.mymethod();
[17:58:50] <ekkis> geekbuntu: I'm always struggling with stuff
[17:59:23] <geekbuntu> i'm self taught - even the 4.0's i've met with cs degrees have to chill and think things through - nothing great is easy
[18:00:05] <eddiemonge> ekkis: thats just polluting the namespace. but if you really wanted to do that, you could define .mymethod() as an additional plugin
[18:00:55] <electronplusplus> I've a problem with jquery UI using modal forms. I'm using a function that runs when document.onload to make a div a modal form but while the document doesn't fully load the div appears, How do I avoid this problem?
[18:01:22] <ekkis> eddiemonge: yes, but eddie, I don't want this method defined for all jquery objects.  I want to define it only for the objects specified
[18:01:30] <ekkis> that's the root of my trouble
[18:01:53] <ajpiano> ekkis: use jQuery.sub()
[18:01:54] <eddiemonge> electronplusplus: use .ready instead of onload
[18:01:58] <ajpiano> ?jQuery.sub
[18:02:00] <bot-t> ajpiano, jQuery.sub() - Creates a new copy of jQuery whose properties and methods can be modified without affecting the original jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.sub/
[18:02:23] <asidjazz> ok eddiemonge sorry
[18:02:35] <ekkis> ajpiano: looking...
[18:02:47] <ajpiano> var myQuery = jQuery.sub();  myQuery.fn.whatever = function() {  return this.each(function() { doStuff(); }) };  myQuery("img").whatever();
[18:02:57] <asidjazz> eddiemonge: http://dev.favorspread.com/
[18:03:13] <asidjazz> eddiemonge: check this out http://dev.favorspread.com/jst/favors.js
[18:03:17] * geekbuntu holds sign up - "listen to the piano"
[18:03:36] <asidjazz> eddiemonge: also if u want .. http://dev.favorspread.com/ajx/favors.php
[18:03:43] <ekkis> ajpiano: wow.  that's a wild approach
[18:03:45] <asidjazz> eddiemonge: thats the json that is pulled in
[18:04:03] <asidjazz> ekkis: looks legit
[18:05:20] <electronplusplus> thanks eddiemonge :)
[18:05:36] <electronplusplus> eddiemonge: http://avmurtosa.com/gestao2/gestao.html user: admin pass:admin
[18:05:39] <eddiemonge> asidjazz: that page's markup is dirty. you should fix it first
[18:05:50] <electronplusplus> switch between 2nd and 3th tab
[18:05:55] <asidjazz> oh man pls dont send me down that road
[18:06:07] <electronplusplus> the div's content is mixed :S
[18:06:25] <eddiemonge> asidjazz: look at it. you have stuff after the closing </html> and you have two copies of jquery and lots of other goody stuff
[18:06:31] <asidjazz> oh
[18:06:31] <asidjazz> here
[18:06:40] <asidjazz> ok refresh
[18:06:42] <asidjazz> my debuger
[18:08:18] <asidjazz> ok yea hmm maybe a mismatched div gimme a sec
[18:08:28] <ekkis> OHH.... I think I see now the error of my ways.  instead of iterating through the elements of the jquery object trying to install methods for each, I need to mark up the jquery object with methods that each know how to iterate through the elements!
[18:08:36] <ekkis> that should give me what I want
[18:09:37] <ajpiano> ekkis: yeah
[18:09:44] <ajpiano> that's how a jquery "plugin" works
[18:09:51] <ajpiano> it's also how a jquery plugin works
[18:09:52] <ajpiano> :p
[18:10:49] <Zer000> guys i tried to use jquery's get to get a page and chrome gives me "Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin." what's with that and how can i fix it?
[18:11:02] <electronplusplus> ajpiano: http://avmurtosa.com/gestao2/gestao.html user:admin pass:admin
[18:11:19] <electronplusplus> switch between tab 2 and 3
[18:11:22] <ekkis> ajpiano: well, the trouble is that plugins usually just do stuff to the underlying objects, but in this case I don't actually want to touch the objects.  I want to install functionality to I can defer the doing... and that was the trouble.  there's no way to install this functionality on a per object basis
[18:11:32] <electronplusplus> the div's content is mixed, why this happens?
[18:11:47] <ajpiano> ekkis: you can do like the whole "stick an instance of a 'class' in the data" thing
[18:11:50] <geekbuntu> eddiemonge, i think i'm going to use this http://www.jqplot.com/tests/  it's not beautiful, but it's light and fast and less painful than most - thanks for the clues :)
[18:13:06] <ajpiano> https://github.com/ajpiano/jquery-boilerplate/blob/widget-lite/jquery.boilerplate.js
[18:13:08] <Zer000> anybody?

[18:14:30] <ajpiano> robots are the future
[18:14:36] <ekkis> ajpiano: but then I'd have to call it like: $(o).data().mymethod() or something like that

[18:15:17] <ajpiano> ekkis: there's nothing clean about attaching arbitrary methods directly to DOM elements
[18:15:17] <ajpiano> :)
[18:15:47] <ekkis> yes, but I won't be attaching them to the DOM elements directly
[18:16:13] <ajpiano> doing it with a basic $.fn.whatever = function() { } works
[18:16:26] <ajpiano> it's just challenging to implement state that way
[18:17:11] <ekkis> ajpiano: cool resource.  thanks!
[18:17:53] <geekbuntu> ajpiano, if it's too much to answer - it's cool, but the addyosmani link - what's that for?

[18:19:18] <ajpiano> we should like, take a look at that thing

[18:19:30] <kborchers> heh
[18:19:47] <ajpiano> nah, didn't get to it yet, in the middle of scrabble-break
[18:20:03] <ajpiano> interesting that you can't reduce
[18:20:04] <ajpiano> hm
[18:20:44] <ajpiano> oh and interesting that i have COGNATE in here
[18:20:46] <ajpiano> whew
[18:21:13] <kborchers> in simple menus select is always fired ... haven't tested right-click context menu. maybe that has something to do with it but not sure why it would
[18:21:49] <ajpiano> the right click is immaterial... i'm just creating a menu and popup on the fly and attempting to position
[18:21:50] <ajpiano> hmm
[18:21:54] <ajpiano> maybe cause im fucking with ti
[18:21:56] <ajpiano> p
[18:22:25] <kborchers> i wouldn't think so ... grabbing at straws i guess ;)

[18:36:01] <asidjazz> err a .scroll() i guess

[19:44:00] <atomiku> Quick question about passing a variable into a .click(function())...
[19:44:28] <atomiku> http://pastebin.com/rCp5KHjV
[19:44:51] <ajpiano> atomiku: see ?forloopscope
[19:44:53] <atomiku> inside the function(){}, profiles[i] isn't defined
[19:44:57] <atomiku> ahh yes, scope
[19:45:05] <bot-t> atomiku, http://forum.jquery.com/topic/binding-event-to-element-dynamically#14737000000958061
[19:45:13] <ajpiano> the "i" isn't locked in
[19:45:24] <atomiku> indeed
[19:45:25] <ajpiano> you need a closure of some sort
[19:45:26] <ajpiano> :)
[19:45:28] <atomiku> thank you
[19:45:31] <atomiku> let me show you what I tried
[19:45:34] <ajpiano> np, showertime for me :)
[19:46:07] <atomiku> var profile_name = profiles[i];
[19:46:07] <atomiku> $("#hover_"+profiles[i]).click(function(){alert(profile_name)});
[19:46:14] <atomiku> i tried to define it within the scope
[19:46:27] <atomiku> but then profile_name was always the last in the loop
[19:46:45] <atomiku> so yes, let me take a look at the article I was linked - thank you
[19:46:46] <ajpiano> there is no block scope in javascript
[19:46:53] <ajpiano> only function scope
[19:47:26] <atomiku> Hmm
[19:47:41] <ajpiano> the easiest thing to do is just use $.each( profiles, function(i, profile) {  $("#hover_"+profile).click(fn);  });
[19:47:46] <atomiku> Ahh yes!
[19:47:52] <ajpiano> the other option being
[19:48:29] <atomiku> I'm going to use the jquery way, but, out of curiosity and for learning....
[19:48:31] <ajpiano> for (var i=0; i<l; i++) {  (function(index) { //do stuff with index here, it's locked in    })(i)    }

[22:52:29] <is_null> muzone: isn't it the browser's job to decompress it ?
[22:54:31] <manizzle> hey can someone help me with some js code im working on involving jquery and jquery-progressbar? attached is code. http://pastie.org/private/gpneqygcr102apkjcsliw
[22:56:55] <coldhead> $("#Status").innerHTML won't work, manizzle
[22:57:13] <coldhead> you need to just use .html('whatever')
[22:57:35] <coldhead> or $('#Status')[0].innerHTML if your heart is really set on it
[22:58:08] <manizzle> what about the other stuff?
[22:58:20] <coldhead> you haven't said what you're having trouble with
[22:58:28] <coldhead> i just glanced at the code and saw that right away
[22:58:35] <coldhead> i don't know progressbar at all though
[22:58:57] <manizzle> ah, well, i load my page, and the progressbar comes up, well, im trying to figure out the best way to debug what is going on
[22:59:14] <manizzle> ive been using chromium js console, but i need to trace into .getJSON and thats messy
[22:59:46] <manizzle> is there a easy to way print to console? i tried to breakpoint the callback_json function, as thats what the meat of its in, but it never seems to get called
[22:59:47] <coldhead> putting debugger; in your callback is a good trick
[23:00:00] <manizzle> just, debugger;
[23:00:02] <manizzle> what does that do?
[23:00:13] <coldhead> it opens the debugger
[23:00:18] <coldhead> and pauses at that point
[23:00:27] <coldhead> so you don't have to mouse aroiund and set a breakpoint
[23:00:57] <coldhead> scorch marks
[23:01:04] <manizzle> dope
[23:03:32] <muzone> How do I decompress SVGZ using JavaScript? I'm trying to set up this world map at http://home.no/dwaynie/map using SVGZ instead of SVG so I can give my users a richer, more detailed map. So far I've tried decompressing it using js-deflate, but to no avail. Does anybody know what to do?
[23:15:15] <coldhead> i guess that's a pretty specialised technology, muzone
[23:15:30] <coldhead> did you see this:
[23:15:32] <coldhead> <is_null> muzone: isn't it the browser's job to decompress it ?
[23:15:49] <coldhead> i assume she means automatically
[23:24:50] <muzone> coldhead: If so - how do I get the browser to decompress it?
[23:25:51] <coldhead> i'm sorry, i've no idea
[23:29:55] <coldhead> muzone: can't you just serve an SVG file and enable compression on your web server?
[23:30:02] <aple> Anyone know of a jQuery alternative to MooTools scrollSpy?
[23:30:12] <coldhead> that should still keep the file small and the zipping will be transparent
[23:32:17] <muzone> coldhead: I need this to work independent from the web server
[23:32:23] <muzone> * independent of
[23:33:01] <coldhead> if you use a regular SVG then it will just work, and it will just work even better on a server with compression
[23:33:18] <coldhead> i don't think you can force browsers to uncompress stuff
[23:33:31] <coldhead> they prefer to do that in co-operation with the server
[23:34:58] <muzone> You're right
[23:35:11] <muzone> I think this solves it man, thanks
[23:36:37] <manizzle> hey coldhead why do i need the [0] when just doing $("#idname")[0].innerHTML but i can do $("#idname").html(mynewhtmlforthatid)
[23:36:52] <coldhead> html is a jQuery method
[23:37:06] <coldhead> innerHTML is attached to the dom element
[23:37:27] <coldhead> the [0] lets you get at the actual dom element, without all the jQuery goodness

[23:49:06] <coldhead> hi thomedy
[23:49:23] <thomedy> what up
[23:50:19] <thomedy> im trying to find an example of a scroll bar so i could get an idea of what im trying to do trying t
[23:50:21] <coldhead> this whole troy davis thing
[23:50:31] <coldhead> oh you want a custom scroll bar?
[23:50:36] <coldhead> those things are EVIL
[23:50:37] <thomedy> im almost there...
[23:50:50] <coldhead> that's what she said
[23:51:35] <thomedy> theyre just mis understood... i am not sure how to i dont know what to google or even how to explain it
[23:51:46] <muzone> I'm trying to set up this world map at http://home.no/dwaynie/map - but how come BlankMap-World8.svg won't appear? It appears in my local testcase.
[23:51:53] <thomedy> my wife never says that  i get a lot of not tonights
[23:52:10] <thomedy>  or maybe after this guy
[23:53:46] <thomedy> one thing i wanted to try was to get e.pageX, but then use that to be the starting point for the next time i click and move
[23:56:38] <coldhead> muzone: Error: HIERARCHY_REQUEST_ERR: DOM Exception 3
[23:56:50] <coldhead> that's caused by jQuery("#new_worldmap").html(data)
[23:56:58] <coldhead> so there must be something nasty in that data
[23:57:47] <muzone> interesting
[23:58:05] <laidback_01_> well, there's no #jqgrid channel...  I'm in a situation where I have a jqgrid working.  and with the onSelect, I can get it to do things with the current grid.  What I'd really like to do is to have it call another html page and put that into a div on the same page.  Is this easy to do?
[23:58:05] <muzone> coldhead: see pm
