[00:38:03] <futzhu> i want to show sweat popup message inside data table after data successfully insert or updated. i have successfully show it with simple alert(); but i want something sweat. can i do that with boostrap or datatable it self?
[00:38:30] <futzhu> something that can dismiss automatically after showing message
[01:07:55] <Cork> futzhu: better ask that in ##bootstrap or datatables forums
[01:08:27] <futzhu> Cork: damn wrong channel. my bad lol. thank you.
[01:58:43] <VectorX> hi, trying to delete some lines from a <pre> tag which are in <del> tags, but having a bit of a issue, its leaving a empty line, got it almost working but doesnt get rid of all the spaces where the lines previously were, https://jsfiddle.net/cgqz6p4c/9/
[02:00:06] <VectorX> so 'Some text 2' and 'Some text 5' shoulds be next to each other, and so also 'Some text 7' and 'Some text 9' should be next to each other
[02:03:40] <Cork> VectorX: pre tags renders line breaks
[02:03:57] <Cork> so you will have to remove the \n from the pre tags text content
[02:04:33] <VectorX> Cork yeah im trying to do that buts its not working completely
[02:05:01] <Cork> simplest option might be to just take the content as text and regex remove the </del>\n
[02:05:53] <Cork> nextSibling won't give you textNodes so you can't do it that way
[02:11:15] <VectorX> alright ill go with the regex route
[02:11:40] <Cork> VectorX: alternatively you can go with just not using a <pre> tag
[02:11:49] <Cork> then you could handle it with elements too
[02:12:08] <Cork> that might be the cleaner solution
[02:12:23] <VectorX> ill consider that, ill have to format a lot of content
[02:17:40] <VectorX> Cork ok guess this will have to do for the moment, thanks, https://jsfiddle.net/cgqz6p4c/10/

[06:10:44] <alexidoia> Hi my site is finished but I have a display problem. My page shows a list of image in columns, and on top of them via css another image half-transparent comes in. The thing is, the images shows first then the image at the top and I'd like to prevent that. My url is http://new.stephanie-cazaentre.com/
[06:41:39] <anki> anyone please help for drag and copy ?
[06:41:39] <anki> I am able to drag and copy element right now. But i need like whatever data-id match with table data-id.That table needs to be copy
[06:47:02] <Cork> alexidoia: are you positioning the images with js?
[06:48:07] <Cork> alexidoia: a better option could be to just use the a tag you wrap around the image and have it cover it instead
[06:50:54] <Cork> alexidoia: https://jsfiddle.net/fheq2btb/
[07:36:36] <ksm101> I think the cover used is not "per image" but covers all the images on the page
[07:47:09] <BulleTTime> Hi
[07:47:34] <BulleTTime> anyone knows why this pen not works out of codepen:
[07:47:35] <BulleTTime> https://codepen.io/BulleTTime/pen/oedRqe?
[07:47:37] <BulleTTime> https://codepen.io/BulleTTime/pen/oedRqe
[07:47:51] <BulleTTime> it says Â¨pointsÂ¨ is undefined
[07:48:10] <BulleTTime> on this line:
[07:48:10] <BulleTTime> var point = polygons[p].points.appendItem(svg.createSVGPoint());
[07:49:32] <ksm101> Not related to TweeMax ?
[07:49:39] <ksm101> Tween*
[07:50:00] <BulleTTime> no, not really it seems
[07:50:12] <BulleTTime> it seems that i need to make use of the Â¨SVG DomÂ¨
[07:50:34] <BulleTTime> this guy explains different ways of doing it:
[07:50:34] <BulleTTime> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25706565/how-do-i-add-coordinates-to-an-svg-polyline
[07:50:42] <BulleTTime> the highest performance option is the SVG DOM as that avoids serialising the points data to/from a string - all UAs I know of store the data internally as an array of floats or doubles rather than a string.
[07:52:48] <ksm101> It works in jsfiddle -> https://jsfiddle.net/ksm101/38e2905u/
[07:53:15] <BulleTTime> indeed:)
[07:53:25] <BulleTTime> im trying to implement it into wordpress
[07:53:41] <BulleTTime> is it perhaps because of that?
[07:55:59] <BulleTTime> any idea what might be the problem?
[07:56:02] <ksm101> Maybe some other js files loading interfering with tweenmax ? I don't know :/
[07:56:35] <BulleTTime> i  thinking of the js might be on the wrong place orso
[08:14:49] <galgamach> Hi all. I have a list of pages that load via Ajax. So I want to be able to do something when I click on the next page. So I use the next() function as in this snippet: https://pastebin.com/e9BULFc0    I don't get the alert though so there should be something wrong. Any hint ?
[08:18:34] <Cork> galgamach: too little context to tell what is going on there
[08:18:50] <Cork> dom structure, ajax code and when this runs is needed to tell
[08:28:29] <galgamach> Cork,  (don't know if this is helpful)  The current variable belong to a button on the bottom of the page which loads different context...like it loads a new page with further products for example but no new HTML page.
[08:28:58] <Cork> galgamach: see if you can make a demo of what you're trying to do in jsfiddle.net
[08:29:41] <Cork> currently it isn't clear what you intend .next() to do
[08:30:02] <BulleTTime> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25706565/how-do-i-add-coordinates-to-an-svg-polyline
[09:03:27] <supay> can i use the wagner dependency injector in jquery by any chance
[09:05:52] <Cork> most likely not, but hard to say without deep knowledgeable of how it works
[11:43:28] <iateadonut> hi.  i'm trying to set a background on click.  the background could take a couple of seconds to load though, so i want to show a timer
[11:44:08] <iateadonut> that's no problem, just  $('#timer').show()   background.css('background', image);
[11:44:28] <iateadonut> i'm wondering how to do $('#timer').hide() only after the background image has been loaded?
[11:45:08] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3646036/javascript-preloading-images
[11:47:40] <iateadonut> that's a good idea.  problem is there's quite a few of them, each are a few MB, and only 3 or 4 will be used.
[11:48:51] <taplar> why's that a problem?
[11:50:51] <taplar> 'when' you do the preload is up to you
[11:51:02] <taplar> whither it's all of them at the start, or on demand before you use them
[12:16:58] <whitefire> hi all how can I get the value of _50f6 class https://image.noelshack.com/fichiers/2017/35/1/1503936982-imgjquery.png
[12:17:33] <whitefire> I tryed (.span._50f6).text() but doesn't work
[12:17:58] <whitefire> probably because there are 2 class with same name ?
[12:18:16] <robertmaxrees> erm
[12:18:54] <robertmaxrees> '.span._50f5' is selecting an element with both "span" and "_50f6" as classes.
[12:19:27] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want $('span.50f6'), but you're nesting a span within a span that has that class.
[12:19:31] <robertmaxrees> which is awfully strange.
[12:20:18] <whitefire> Uncaught Error: <![EX[["Tried to get element with id of \"%s\" but it is not present on the page.","span.50f6"]]]>
[12:20:50] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:20:53] <whitefire> it doesn't work
[12:21:03] <robertmaxrees> what did you tryt?
[12:21:19] <whitefire> $('span.50f6')
[12:21:31] <robertmaxrees> go to your console and try $.fn.jquery
[12:21:35] <robertmaxrees> what do you get back?
[12:22:00] <whitefire> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'jquery' of undefined
[12:22:00] <whitefire>     at <anonymous>:1:5
[12:22:06] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[12:22:08] <robertmaxrees> dpm
[12:22:15] <robertmaxrees> *don't have jquery on that page.
[12:22:16] <whitefire> dpm ? meaning ?
[12:22:20] <whitefire> hum ok
[12:22:49] <whitefire> but I tried also javascript with getElementByClassname but It give undefined result
[12:22:53] <robertmaxrees> you can try jQuery.fn.jquery and see if it's an issue with the name.
[12:23:05] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[12:23:09] <whitefire> var x= document.getElementsByClassName('_50f6'); alert(x);
[12:23:37] <whitefire> Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined
[12:23:37] <whitefire>     at <anonymous>:1:1     -> that make sense^^
[12:23:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, same thing as befor.e
[12:23:55] <robertmaxrees> so no jquery on the page.
[12:24:08] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fcu1n5hr/
[12:24:09] <whitefire> ok ok thx could u help in js ?
[12:24:11] <robertmaxrees> that works fine.
[12:24:16] <whitefire> i'll try
[12:24:31] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up ##javascript and see what they have to say.
[12:25:07] <iateadonut> taplar, i see now.  thanks.
[12:25:21] <taplar> you should eat healthier man
[12:25:52] <whitefire> i'll try in js because it give me undifined result
[12:26:26] <iateadonut> ha!  i stepped away for a while.
[12:26:39] <robertmaxrees> whitefire erm.
[12:26:49] <robertmaxrees> you're not including jquery, that's why jquery is undefined,.
[12:26:57] <robertmaxrees> can't use it if you don't add it.
[12:27:00] <iateadonut> d'oh!  i see what you mean.
[12:27:16] <iateadonut> i'm trying to remember the last time i had a donut.  it's been a few months i think
[12:27:21] <iateadonut> anyway thanks.  see you
[12:27:44] <whitefire> robertmaxrees: it's not my html source^^, i know i can add jquery but i prefer using js function
[12:27:58] <robertmaxrees> whitefire then yeah, ##javascript is where you wanna be :)
[12:28:03] <whitefire> thx Robdgreat
[13:37:11] <hellyeah> short question
[13:37:24] <hellyeah> are these different?
[13:37:42] <hellyeah> $(function() {..}) and +(function(){...})
[13:37:45] * taplar was trying to come up with a height joke
[13:37:57] <taplar> yes, they are different.  the second doesn't use jquery
[13:38:04] <taplar> and executes immediately always
[13:38:13] <hellyeah> like
[13:38:21] <taplar> i'm assuming the '+' was a typo?
[13:38:28] <hellyeah> (function{}( ... )()}
[13:38:31] <hellyeah> is it same
[13:38:35] <hellyeah> no
[13:38:38] <taplar> you got a typo
[13:38:40] <hellyeah> i see + in jquery ui code
[13:38:47] <taplar> ?
[13:38:54] <hellyeah> really i saw that
[13:38:59] <taplar> where?
[13:39:09] <hellyeah> i dont remember which file
[13:39:18] <hellyeah> sometimes ago
[13:39:27] <taplar> (function(){}()) is just an IIFE
[13:39:41] <hellyeah> immediate execution
[13:39:42] <hellyeah> right
[13:39:49] <taplar> $(function) will operate like $(document).ready(function)
[13:41:36] <ploupz> guy someone have knowledge in chrome extension dev ?
[13:41:53] <taplar> in #jquery ?
[13:42:00] <ploupz> I have a problem with my extension, it supposed to edit the value of a element of my website
[13:42:04] <ploupz> but it does nothing
[13:42:11] <taplar> maybe find a room related to that topic then
[13:42:13] <ploupz> and when parsing code in console it works
[13:42:37] <ploupz> Tadas:  i asked in chrome and chromium, js and no response
[13:42:43] <ploupz> taplar: *
[13:42:52] <ploupz> that's why I ask here
[13:42:52] <robertmaxrees> ploupz soooo
[13:43:05] <robertmaxrees> ploupz for what it's worth, that doesn't change the topic of this channel ;)
[13:43:20] <ploupz> it's related to jquery^^
[13:43:26] <ploupz> as i used jquery to code it^^
[13:43:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:43:39] <ploupz> xD
[13:43:56] <robertmaxrees> nice try ;)
[13:44:08] <ploupz> :)
[13:46:10] <hellyeah> you use "use strict" in jquery?
[13:46:23] <taplar> javascript
[13:46:42] <hellyeah> okey are you using it when you write jquery
[13:46:58] <taplar> in my own projects, sure
[13:47:06] <hellyeah> ah okey
[13:47:11] <hellyeah> i am blogging nowadays
[13:47:19] <taplar> sorry to hear that
[13:47:22] <hellyeah> can you give me why you use those
[13:47:27] <hellyeah> why?
[13:47:31] <hellyeah> D
[13:47:31] <taplar> joking
[13:47:35] <hellyeah> ehehe
[13:47:54] <taplar> it forces you to code in a more consistent manner, is my reasoning
[13:47:55] <hellyeah> https://spinningcat.github.io/blog/
[13:48:12] <hellyeah> is it the only reason?
[13:48:18] <hellyeah> i mean can we say that
[13:48:22] <taplar> you can google all the things that use strict causes the compiler to fail on
[13:48:48] <hellyeah> it force the interpreter to interpret program in strict environment?
[13:49:02] <taplar> more strict rules
[13:49:14] <hellyeah> hmm
[13:49:22] <hellyeah> i wonder what those strict rules are
[13:49:23] <taplar> such as you can't have a variable without having it defined with var first
[13:49:47] <taplar> where as without it you could.  which would be a global variable.  which you may not be thinking about
[13:50:23] <taplar> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1335851/what-does-use-strict-do-in-javascript-and-what-is-the-reasoning-behind-it
[13:52:15] <hellyeah> taplar:
[13:52:21] <hellyeah> can i show you my sentence?
[13:52:43] <taplar> sure?
[13:52:46] <hellyeah> Before writing about using "use strict" in javascript, i should also tell    you javascript interpreter does not warn you every possible error. Sometimes     javascript just assumes your intension and do some correction.
[13:53:27] <taplar> technically it's not an error
[13:53:41] <taplar> take a read of that S.O. post i linked
[13:54:11] <hellyeah> dfoes not warn you for every situtation
[13:54:14] <hellyeah> is it better?
[13:54:18] <hellyeah> i am gonna read
[13:54:25] <robertmaxrees> "better" is relative fwiw.
[13:55:21] <hellyeah> yeah
[13:55:36] <hellyeah> but i am just meaantioning some subjective statement here
[13:56:08] <taplar> why not explain why you choose to use it?
[13:56:27] <taplar> present your opinion and viewpoint
[13:56:39] <hellyeah> thats what i try to do
[13:56:59] <taplar> then why did you ask me why i use it? ;)
[13:57:06] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:00:45] <hellyeah> taplar:
[14:00:48] <hellyeah> just opinion
[14:00:56] <mod> I'm adding some radio buttons with labels to the dom, and afterwards attempting to check and bold the first one in the list. I don't understand why it's not working.  When I go into chromes console and run the last two lines, they work. But it doesn't work as the JS executes
[14:00:58] <mod> https://gist.github.com/jasongabler/cb8b4c6dab160bc5577a8f251d5b8268
[14:01:07] <hellyeah> well the best thing about writing bloe is to envy up the process of learning
[14:01:11] <hellyeah> and memorizing etc.
[14:01:51] <robertmaxrees> mod well
[14:02:08] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[14:02:15] <mod> :)
[14:02:18] <robertmaxrees> which part doesn't work?
[14:02:44] <mod> The label doesn't go bold and the radio doesn't get checked. (the first of the set, that is)
[14:02:56] <robertmaxrees> got some sample data for us to kick at?
[14:03:49] <mod> put in whatever you want for 'val'.  Make it "red", "yellow", "blue" :)
[14:03:55] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:03:59] <robertmaxrees> don't make me do extra work, yo.
[14:05:00] <robertmaxrees> either way: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nt3qjb5r/
[14:05:03] <robertmaxrees> works fine here.
[14:05:04] <robertmaxrees> soooo
[14:05:10] <mod> :-/
[14:05:39] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/nt3qjb5r/1/
[14:05:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd try this.
[14:05:48] <robertmaxrees> see if you're repeating that ID.
[14:07:25] <hellyeah> one more question
[14:07:27] <mod> hmm yeah, I'm not. But at least we can confirm it's something else interfering. Thanks. Didn't even thikn of trying in JSFiddle :p
[14:07:48] <hellyeah> would yo put "use strict" to the top or you use "use strict" for every functions?
[14:08:01] <taplar> why repeat?
[14:08:02] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah depends on the use case.
[14:08:16] <robertmaxrees> if you want to do it for a whole file, why not pop it at the top?
[14:08:37] <hellyeah> i just try to ask every possibility
[14:08:52] <hellyeah> i prefer to put at the top
[14:08:56] <hellyeah> thats for sure
[14:09:01] <taplar> did you ask yourself why you would repeat it for ever function?
[14:09:06] <hellyeah> what do you mean "use case" btw
[14:09:17] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah a lot of this stuff can be situational.
[14:09:22] <hellyeah> for me it is not necesarry
[14:09:36] <hellyeah> but i am not experienced like you and robertmaxrees
[14:09:38] <taplar> so did you ask yourself when it would be necessary?
[14:10:01] <robertmaxrees> for instance, if you're writing from scratch and want to follow a particular convention, just use it.  if you're in a file that's been written by other people, you likely wouldn't put use strict up at the top.
[14:10:08] <hellyeah> it is necessary if i dont want to see weirdos :D
[14:10:09] <robertmaxrees> unless you want to update the whole thing.
[14:10:24] <hellyeah> ah
[14:10:25] <hellyeah> i see
[14:10:28] <taplar> you'd also stick it inside an IIFE if you are writing a plugin
[14:10:36] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:10:41] <robertmaxrees> hence "use case"
[14:10:52] <hellyeah> the only using of "use strict" in that case putting that to the function i wrote
[14:11:04] <taplar> huh?
[14:11:30] <hellyeah> nevermind
[14:11:43] <hellyeah> es5 is backward compatible with es3
[14:11:45] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:11:50] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:11:52] <taplar> lol
[14:11:56] <robertmaxrees> not necessarily.
[14:12:02] <hellyeah> https://johnresig.com/blog/ecmascript-5-strict-mode-json-and-more/
[14:12:03] <robertmaxrees> es5 introduced things es3 doesn't have.
[14:12:06] <hellyeah> check that place
[14:12:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:12:14] <taplar> this convo is so disjointed
[14:12:19] <hellyeah> what
[14:12:25] <hellyeah> disjointed
[14:12:28] <hellyeah> what does that mean
[14:12:29] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah your statement is inaccurate.
[14:12:31] <hellyeah> is it false?
[14:12:38] <taplar> random, disconnected
[14:12:41] <robertmaxrees> he means you're all over the place and jumping from topic to topci.
[14:12:43] <robertmaxrees> *topic
[14:12:59] <hellyeah> Since ESince ECMAScript 5 is backwards-compatible with ECMAScript 3, all of the âfeaturesâ that were in ECMAScript 3 that were âdeprecatedâ are just disabled
[14:13:45] <hellyeah> anyway
[14:13:46] <hellyeah> hmm
[14:13:52] <hellyeah> this is not my sentence
[14:13:56] <hellyeah> i just try to learn
[14:14:28] <robertmaxrees> he means that the syntax is the same but that doesn't mean that es3 has the same features.
[14:15:16] <hellyeah> i understand like "use strict" disable the depreceated features belongs to ES3
[14:15:21] <hellyeah> did i get it false?
[14:15:55] <taplar> i take it you didn't read that S.O. link i gave
[14:16:06] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode
[14:16:22] <hellyeah> i will read all of
[14:16:36] <taplar> so do that before asking more questions about it
[14:16:46] <taplar> cause the chances that those articles will answer your questions are high
[14:16:46] <hellyeah> okey
[14:17:19] <hellyeah> btw
[14:17:32] <hellyeah> the article i shared here was meantioned in S.O. question
[14:17:51] <robertmaxrees> he's trying to give you more resources.
[14:18:06] <robertmaxrees> it's important to fully read those things so you can reason about what's right for you.
[14:21:12] <hellyeah> "use strict" wont avoid type coercion
[14:25:57] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:31:45] <mod> Why would you ask about purgation?
[14:31:46] <mod> oops
[15:08:54] <hellyeah> javascript is weird
[15:09:00] <hellyeah> i wonder jquery is weird
[15:09:23] <hellyeah> function foo(bar , bar) is allowed without "use strict"
[15:10:01] <robertmaxrees> "i wonder jquery is weird" <- huh?
[15:10:09] <hellyeah> :D
[15:10:27] <hellyeah> what a weird behaivour
[15:10:36] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:10:52] <hellyeah> same variable names you can use
[15:10:58] <hellyeah> if you dont use "use strict"
[15:11:02] <robertmaxrees> what does that have to do with jquery?
[15:11:17] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:11:23] <hellyeah> guess nothing :D
[15:11:40] <robertmaxrees> uhm
[15:11:41] <robertmaxrees> okay heh
[15:14:42] <hellyeah> i guess jquery didnt care the internal error of javascript
[15:14:48] <hellyeah> that make sense
[15:17:08] <MikeD_> why do people think jquery is anything other than javascript?
[15:18:51] <MikeD_> well, i guess various *script that's transpiled really isn't javascript... but there's a ton of other libs that are conventions for how to do stuff within the confines of javascript, so i'm curious what makes jquery so weird
[15:19:32] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:19:44] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[15:19:55] <robertmaxrees> because they learn it before they understand programming.
[15:20:03] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah you realize that jquery IS javascript, right?
[15:20:08] <robertmaxrees> so it can't, like, change the language.
[15:22:51] <hellyeah> ofc i know jquery is javascript
[15:23:00] <hellyeah> when you write function without () in console
[15:23:06] <hellyeah> you can see content of function
[15:23:11] <robertmaxrees> right.
[15:23:19] <robertmaxrees> you see the object.
[15:23:25] <robertmaxrees> since functions in JS are objects.
[15:23:35] <hellyeah> okey
[15:23:41] <hellyeah> my question does not make sense?
[15:23:46] <hellyeah> :p
[15:23:48] <hellyeah> ops
[15:23:51] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?
[15:23:54] <hellyeah> forget about question mark
[15:24:03] <robertmaxrees> for...?
[15:24:07] <hellyeah> forget about it i am confused
[15:24:22] <robertmaxrees> you mean "how do you see the definition of a function"?
[15:24:26] <hellyeah> it is almost 6 hours
[15:24:54] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  it is just weired to use "use strict to avoid function smt(foo, foo)
[15:25:01] <hellyeah> i just wonder your opinion about it
[15:25:03] <hellyeah> thats all
[15:25:06] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[15:25:07] <robertmaxrees> that's easy.
[15:25:09] <robertmaxrees> use a linter.
[15:25:41] <hellyeah> jslint?
[15:25:49] <robertmaxrees> i prefer eslint these days.
[15:25:50] <robertmaxrees> but sure.
[15:25:53] <robertmaxrees> just pick one and uise it.
[15:25:55] <robertmaxrees> *use
[15:26:05] <hellyeah> hmm
[15:26:45] <robertmaxrees> the easiest way to catch small mistakes like that are to setup tools to remind you not to make them in the first placer.
[15:26:47] <robertmaxrees> *place
[15:38:49] <hellyeah> i guess
[15:38:55] <hellyeah> you can install eslint with node
[15:39:03] <hellyeah> i need to do somewebpack
[15:39:08] <robertmaxrees> or
[15:39:11] <robertmaxrees> are you using VS Code?
[15:39:14] <hellyeah> and i need manual npm script
[15:39:25] <hellyeah> visual studio?
[15:39:46] <robertmaxrees> visual studio code
[15:39:52] <robertmaxrees> their free text editor
[15:39:59] <hellyeah> ah yes
[15:39:59] <robertmaxrees> kinda like sublime text/atom
[15:40:01] <hellyeah> i know that
[15:40:08] <robertmaxrees> what editor are you using these days?
[15:40:12] <hellyeah> vs code is kinda cool
[15:40:13] <hellyeah> nano
[15:40:25] <hellyeah> i love terminal-based
[15:40:30] <robertmaxrees> D:
[15:40:33] <robertmaxrees> welp
[15:40:39] <hellyeah> welp?
[15:40:44] <hellyeah> do you mean help
[15:40:45] <hellyeah> :D
[15:40:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:40:50] <robertmaxrees> eithe rway.
[15:40:56] <hellyeah> anwhat does welp mean?
[15:41:03] <hellyeah> i can use vscode
[15:41:06] <robertmaxrees> it's like "well" only kind of funny.
[15:41:08] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[15:41:24] <robertmaxrees> more modern editors can be setup to use eslint and check your code as you type.
[15:41:29] <robertmaxrees> might be worth looking into.
[15:41:41] <robertmaxrees> gotta get lunch byeeee
[15:41:49] <hellyeah> bye
