[00:34:03] <Kartagis> I've got jquery.mobile.js src'd on my page. however, data-transition doesn't work. any ideas?
[00:34:44] <Kartagis> my bad, I mistyped as data-attribute
[01:56:15] <morphyeys> hello guys, is it okay If I get 303 post ?
[02:01:50] <hd1> trying to rendera csv using highcharts i know i'm doing something stupid, but i can't figure out what... http://logging.d8u.us/static/linechart.html
[03:21:14] <JNDPNT> I seem to have a problem using jquery plugins, they are say "... is not a function". Even my sample plugin is not working, does anybody have an idea what I'm doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/4qxv5mrc/
[03:25:53] <zanderle> I have a problem with $.get - I have API that returns two numbers. In some cases one of these two numbers can be Infinity in which case I have problems with jQuery get
[03:26:10] <zanderle> For example, if I run $.get('/api/concurrent_limit/').always(function(data) { console.log(data); });
[03:26:26] <zanderle> I expect something like Object {absolute_limit: 399, concurrent_limit: 1}
[03:26:35] <zanderle> but in case of Infinity I will get:
[03:26:45] <zanderle> Object {readyState: 4, responseText: "{"absolute_limit":Infinity,"concurrent_limit":1.0}", status: 200, statusText: "OK"}
[03:26:58] <zanderle> Why is that, and what can I do to fix it?
[03:28:26] <JNDPNT> Why can't you use data.responseText instead? This is the object you are looking for
[03:36:10] <zanderle> JNDPNT, I just don't get it why it's different in these two cases
[03:36:37] <zanderle> would using responseText work in both cases? (i'm off to try it)
[03:36:51] <zanderle> but yeah, that's a possible solution
[03:39:54] <JNDPNT> Not sure as to why it returns different responses depending on the value, sorry
[03:54:00] <zanderle> JNDPNT, thanks anyway
[04:01:27] <Varun_Krishna> Hi all I have a doubt in this, I am trying to validate two text boxes, when I am leaving both the text boxes blank and click the validate button it is showing only the message for the first text box. What am I doing wrong ? I have may different cases. 1 case the value should be nuber. 2. case the value should be a number between 1 and 10.
[04:01:41] <Varun_Krishna> Here is my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Varun_Krishna/mhjsmtkp/
[04:07:39] <Dayset> Set 0 in first box and validate - got two errors, validation works, if statements are messy
[04:14:33] <Shebbi> is it possible to somehow make this valid: $( $(this).find('a') ).remove();
[04:15:15] <taplar> $(this).find('a').remove()
[04:18:42] <Cork> Shebbi: what you wrote there is actually valid too :)
[04:18:49] <Cork> just not needed
[04:19:40] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: How do I change the logic there ?
[04:20:37] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: you're aborting the validation of the rest of the files in line 9
[04:20:43] <Cork> uh... files??
[04:20:47] <Cork> *fields
[04:24:09] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: http://jsfiddle.net/mhjsmtkp/6/
[04:24:30] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: also you might want to check into jquery validator
[04:32:03] <Shebbi> what is the quickest way to get to span.status from $(this) referring to clicked in <p><span></span><span.status></status><span><a>clicked</a></span></p>
[04:32:44] <Shebbi> i have a solution but it seems long
[04:33:24] <Cork> $(this).closest('p').find('status').text()
[04:33:32] <Cork> * $(this).closest('p').find('.status').text()
[04:34:22] <Shebbi> $(this).parents('p:first').find('.status').text()
[04:34:34] <Shebbi> yours is better
[04:34:41] <Cork> don't use parents for that
[04:34:54] <Cork> it have a risk of giving you something you didn't expect
[04:35:35] <Shebbi> ok
[04:35:47] <Cork> ex: <div class="t"><div><ul><li class="t"><a></a></li><li class="t"><a></a></li><li class="t"><a>click</a></li>
[04:36:12] <Cork> $(this).parents('.t:first').find('a:first').text() "opps"
[04:37:18] <Mark_2> can anyone help me with this jquery plugin? the video div won’t go to the back of the contents.
[04:37:18] <Cork> so unless you explicitly want multiple elements back always use closest
[04:37:19] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/
[04:38:08] <Cork> Mark_2: side note, but you have broken conditional comments
[04:38:15] <Cork> (line 7)
[04:38:25] <Mark_2> sec
[04:38:42] <Cork> and you have <script> after </body> and that isn't valid
[04:38:52] <Shebbi> Cork: your example returns what? i expect 'click'
[04:39:01] <Cork> uh... and you have <div> after </html> and ... just no
[04:39:15] <Cork> Shebbi: <a></a>
[04:39:24] <Cork> Shebbi: it will find the <div class="t"
[04:39:33] <Cork> and then find the first a link in that element
[04:40:17] <Shebbi> Cork: you used ('.t:first') so it should be <li class="t"> it finds first
[04:40:40] <Cork> Shebbi: parents doesn't "find first"
[04:40:47] <Cork> it returns all of the parents
[04:40:54] <Cork> that i exactly the problem
[04:41:17] <Shebbi> Cork: you saying ':first' is not working here?
[04:41:21] <Mark_2> fixed those, and it’s still not workin g cork.
[04:41:33] <Mark_2> it has something to do with its css ain’t it?
[04:41:53] <Cork> Shebbi: i'm saying use closest if you want closest, not parents
[04:42:41] <Shebbi> Cork: I thought parents('.t:first') means first parents with class t
[04:42:45] <Mark_2> ah found it.
[04:43:28] <Shebbi> Cork: closest looks upstream or both?
[04:43:47] <Cork> ?api closest
[04:43:47] <b-ot> Cork: .closest(): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/
[04:44:00] <Shebbi> upstream
[04:44:07] <Cork> parents returns all parents matching the selector
[04:44:42] <Shebbi> :first should trigger script error then
[04:44:49] <Cork> no
[04:44:56] <Shebbi> would be nicer.
[04:45:04] <Shebbi> then i would know not to use it
[04:45:15] <Cork> parents does a similar things
[04:45:20] <Cork> but it isn't the same
[04:45:43] <Cork> and parents('selector') isn't invalid
[04:45:45] <Shebbi> Thanks Corks
[04:45:58] <Shebbi> *Cork
[04:46:10] <Cork> but it is VERY common for ppl to misuse parents instead of closest
[04:46:19] <Cork> *instead of using closest
[04:46:28] <Shebbi> Yeah noobs like me
[04:48:59] <Shebbi> Cork: you know how long ajax calls wait before they time out?
[04:49:08] <Cork> depends on the server
[04:49:23] <Shebbi> Cork: so where is it set?
[04:50:55] <Cork> Shebbi: like i said, normally the timeout is handled server side
[04:51:12] <jamesdrawneekAIR> Anyone fancy having a look at this: https://jsfiddle.net/crphnkgv/10/   I'm learning jQuery/javascript and wondered if there's a better way to use this switch. It's used twice but I'm struggling to get it to function for both uses without duplication.
[04:51:24] <Cork> Shebbi: if the connection succeeds and the client manage to send the request it will wait indefinitely for the server
[04:51:26] <Shebbi> Cork: where on serverside is it handled?
[04:51:36] <Cork> depends on the server software
[04:51:48] <Cork> nginx/appache config
[04:52:01] <Cork> or what ever other software you're using prob have a config for it somewhere
[04:52:25] <Shebbi> "wait indefinitely for the server" <-- wow
[04:52:56] <taplar> indefinitely !== infinitely
[04:53:03] <Cork> Shebbi: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#xmlhttprequest-timeout
[04:53:14] <Cork> "A value of 0 (which is the default) means there is no timeout."
[04:54:12] <Cork> Shebbi: but if you want the client to limit the connection time more then the server does you can add a shorter time there
[04:54:32] <Cork> $.ajax sets it if you set timeout in the options
[04:56:09] <Plural> Hello everyone.
[04:56:38] <Shebbi> Cork: are timeouts usually used for file uploads?
[04:58:03] <undergod> hi there! how can i set to autocomplete a input with the history of previously input values when i press key down and show the autocomplete result in the input itself?
[04:58:04] <Cork> Shebbi: servers normally always have a timeout
[04:58:07] <undergod> thank you
[04:58:08] <Cork> else you can ddos them
[04:58:32] <undergod> or key up
[04:58:56] <Cork> undergod: browsers normally do that by default
[04:59:13] <Shebbi> Cork: pretty sure server config will have timeouts set by default
[04:59:19] <Cork> and if you want to implement it in js you would have to store the "old values" yourself
[04:59:30] <Cork> Shebbi: ya, that is what i said :)
[05:00:00] <undergod> Cork, but the autocomplete result isn't shown on the input field itself! how can i do that?
[05:00:15] <Cork> undergod: uh, what?
[05:00:18] <Shebbi> Cork: you said it waits indefinately...
[05:00:28] <Cork> Shebbi: in ajax ya
[05:00:37] <Cork> ajax is the browser
[05:00:47] <Cork> and the browser doesn't have any timeout by default
[05:01:07] <Shebbi> Cork: then probably a good idea to set timeouts to match server.
[05:01:15] <Cork> Shebbi: no
[05:01:32] <Cork> cause then you have to update the config in two places every time you want to change it
[05:01:42] <Cork> you normally don't need to have a timeout client side
[05:01:58] <Cork> cause if you lose the connection to the server the session gets closed
[05:02:09] <Shebbi> Cork: some clients might get annoyed waiting indefinately.
[05:02:15] <Cork> ...
[05:02:16] <Cork> they won't
[05:02:38] <undergod> by default the autocomplete result in browsers are shown in a select right of the bottom of the input. I just want the result appear in the input field itself
[05:02:46] <Shebbi> Cork: session doesn't get closed until clients closes the browser.
[05:02:54] <Cork> 1) client starts to upload, 2) server accepts the connection 3) client starts to send the data
[05:03:04] <Cork> 4) the server times out the connection
[05:03:12] <Cork> 5) client loses the connection as the session is closed
[05:04:14] <Shebbi> where does ajax loader go to ensure it doesn't load indefinatly?
[05:04:19] <Cork> Shebbi: i'm not talking about http session cookie here
[05:04:28] <Cork> i'm talking about tcp session
[05:04:37] <Shebbi> Cork: right.
[05:05:18] <Cork> Shebbi: there is only one timeout needed client side
[05:05:32] <Cork> and that is when the server doesn't respond to the connection at all
[05:06:23] <Shebbi> Cork: thats what i mean to set timeout clientside to match server
[05:06:37] <Cork> but those two are extreamly different
[05:07:01] <Shebbi> Cork: you got jsfiddle with those two examples handy?
[05:07:02] <Cork> one is how long the server can take before it have to accept the tcp connection or the client will abort
[05:07:25] <Cork> the other is how long the client/server can keep sending data over the connection before the server closes it
[05:07:57] <Shebbi> Cork: that is right.
[05:08:07] <Cork> so matching them makes absolutely no sense
[05:08:26] <Cork> usually if anything you want the connect timeout to be really short
[05:08:28] <Shebbi> Cork: for the first one it does.
[05:08:30] <Cork> like 2-3 sec
[05:08:50] <Varun_Krishna> Cork: Thank you man. And so sorry for the late reply...
[05:09:03] <Cork> but the session timeout to be as long as you can stomach without exposing yourself to ddos
[05:09:19] <Cork> so common is like 5-10 minutes
[05:10:22] <Shebbi> Cork: you got a fiddle for the first example on client side.
[05:12:02] <Cork> Shebbi: as far as i know browsers doesn't expose that to the page
[05:12:11] <Cork> it is controlled in browser configs
[05:14:44] <Shebbi> one is how long the server can take before it have to accept the tcp connection or the client will abort
[05:15:00] <Cork> ya, and that is a browser option
[05:15:01] <Shebbi> perhaps set a timeout for that on clientside
[05:15:24] <Shebbi> using $ajax timeout
[05:15:41] <Cork> $.ajax timeout is about how long the session can be open
[05:15:50] <Cork> not the server connect timeout
[05:16:15] <Cork> for firefox for example it is about:config?filter=network.http.connection-timeout
[05:17:03] <Shebbi> then set a session timeout for file upload
[05:17:10] <Shebbi> using $ajax timeout
[05:17:35] <Shebbi> though you saying it's not needed
[05:17:43] <Cork> ...
[05:17:50] <Cork> read through what i've said again
[05:18:16] <Varun_Krishna> Cork:  Thank you Bye :-)
[05:18:34] <Cork> Varun_Krishna: yw
[05:18:35] <Shebbi> Cork: whats the point of $ajax timeout if you're saying it's not needed for the past 30 minutes.
[05:18:59] <Cork> Shebbi: i've already answered that several times
[05:19:42] <Shebbi> Cork: no, i'm talking about $ajax timeout
[05:20:50] <Cork> Shebbi: ok, for the last time i won't say this again; timeout in ajax is there if you want the client to control how long the connection can be open before a force close is triggered
[05:20:56] <Cork> instead of the server controlling it
[05:21:48] <Shebbi> <Cork> you normally don't need to have a timeout client side
[05:22:37] <Shebbi> so when do you need a $ajax timeout?
[05:22:38] <Shebbi> :-)
[05:22:52] <Cork> read what i wrote two minutes ago
[05:23:06] <Cork> it is the answer to that exact question...
[05:23:12] <Shebbi> You got specific examples?
[05:23:36] <Cork> uh no?
[05:23:59] <Cork> if you want the client to be the one limiting the length of the connection instead of the server
[05:24:02] <Cork> set timeout in ajax
[05:24:10] <Cork> else leave it at 0 and let the server do it
[05:24:53] <Shebbi> just wondering when it's REALLY needed.
[05:25:08] <Shebbi> nevermind if you don't know.
[05:25:16] <Cork> ...
[05:25:33] <Cork> i've just answered that over and over again...
[05:25:41] <Cork> are you trying to troll me or something?
[05:25:53] <Shebbi> <Cork> uh no?
[05:26:14] <Cork> i can't be more specific then giving an explicit use case no
[05:26:45] <Shebbi> exactly my point. thanks. bye.
[05:26:57] <Cork> O_o'
[05:37:53] <jamesdrawneekAIR> Is the correct way to pass the this variable to a function ->  filter_servicetypes(this);  ?
[05:40:24] <jamesdrawneekAIR> wow that person was rude
[05:41:40] <Cork> jamesdrawneekAIR: .call(this)
[05:41:51] <Cork> meaning filter_servicetypes.call(this)
[05:42:03] <jamesdrawneekAIR> Cork: Ah!
[05:42:13] <Cork> ?mdn function.call
[05:42:16] <b-ot> Cork: Call - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call
[05:42:18] <jamesdrawneekAIR> Cork: There's a function for everything :oD
[05:42:23] <Cork> ?mdn function.apply
[05:42:23] <b-ot> Cork: Function.prototype.apply() - JavaScript - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/apply
[05:42:40] <Cork> read up on those they're really usefull
[05:42:52] <jamesdrawneekAIR> Cork: I will thanks
[06:07:06] <motaka2> how to increase the current left property of an elemnt ?
[06:18:02] <john-dev> motaka2: $(#element).css(‚left‘,$(#element).css(‚left’)+<inc_value>
[06:18:08] <john-dev> );
[06:26:10] <motaka2> john-dev: this doesnt work
[06:27:28] <motaka2> john-dev: this doesnt work
[06:27:30] <motaka2> http://pastebin.com/866dvJtU
[06:34:58] <decx> there is no right in position
[06:37:41] <john-dev> motaka2: as decs said, there is no right in .position(), only top and left
[06:38:04] <jamesdrawneekAIR> Anyone have any ideas why this isnt working? https://jsfiddle.net/bh7dpnda/   the alerts show the this is correct but the "$(this).hasClass('getstarted'):" cases don't seem to get triggered
[06:38:44] <motaka2> john-dev: position worked for me, I had to add position:relative
[06:38:49] <decx> i hate the new syntax colours in jsfiddle
[06:38:58] <motaka2> Is there a hover out event ?
[06:39:25] <john-dev> jamesdrawneekAIR: that’s not how switch statements work
[06:39:47] <john-dev> use if / else there
[06:40:02] <decx> wait what
[06:40:07] <decx> switch (true)
[06:40:31] <jamesdrawneekAIR> john-dev: Ah. I'm learning so it's more than likely wrong.
[06:40:56] <john-dev> jamesdrawneekAIR: yes, the cases must match the switch argument, this will never work
[06:41:06] <decx> look at the cases
[06:41:12] <decx> they all do the same thing
[06:41:29] <decx> you can refactor it to a single function
[06:41:45] <mukesh> Hi friends
[06:41:51] <john-dev> try: if($('.servicethumbs').hasClass('getfit') || $(this).hasClass('getfit‘)) { $('.page-id-61').find('.gone').removeClass('gone'); ...
[06:42:10] <mukesh> is there any library which will track the time spend on particular website
[06:42:31] <taplar> google analytics probably
[06:42:40] <jamesdrawneekAIR> john-dev: So a set of if statements
[06:42:45] <mukesh> anything else
[06:42:53] <mukesh> taplar
[06:43:05] <taplar> not that i'm familiar with, at least
[06:43:07] <john-dev> mukesh: simply set a cookie if it doesnt exist with a timestamp
[06:43:09] <taplar> probably is
[06:43:16] <jamesdrawneekAIR> john-dev: What does || do? Or is that just trying to format on irc?
[06:43:22] <john-dev> jamesdrawneekAIR: it means OR
[06:43:32] <john-dev> || = OR, && = AND
[06:43:33] <jamesdrawneekAIR> john-dev: AH!
[06:43:46] <mukesh> I want to detect even if he is doing some stuff like mouse moving or not some type of video is playing et
[06:43:48] <john-dev> read javascript operators for more infos
[06:43:48] <mukesh> etc
[06:44:06] <mukesh> or moved to some other tab
[06:44:06] <mukesh> then
[06:44:10] <john-dev> mukesh: use onbeforeunload
[06:44:17] <mukesh> so in that case cookies won't work
[06:46:24] <john-dev> you want to determine the time a users watched a video (without streaming server) right?
[06:47:37] <mr_pinc> Greetings - I've got a drag and drop app that is inside of a container with a css: zoom property set.  The drag drop does not work properly when zoom is not set to 1 - the position of the dragging and dropping is off.  I've found a solution to fix the dragging - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8605439/jquery-draggable-div-with-zoom/8605589#8605589 - but I've not been able to find anythign
[06:47:37] <mr_pinc> on fixing the position of the droppable elements - any help would be appreciated
[06:48:54] <jamesdrawneekAIR> So in this instance using an if statements is correct because of the OR logic? (I thought a switch would suit because it was checking the same element for difffernt values)
[06:49:54] <john-dev> jamesdrawneekAIR: a switch would look like this: switch(('.servicethumbs').hasClass('getfit‘)) { case true:…. }
[06:50:11] <john-dev> if / else if / else is what you are looking for
[06:50:22] <taplar> switches are used for cases that your checking many values
[06:50:27] <prohobo> switches are best for a set of possible values on one conditional
[06:50:47] <taplar> small sets are better for if else blocks
[06:50:54] <prohobo> if you got a lot of conditions with bools then use if, or restructure your code so you don't have to! :D
[06:52:07] <jamesdrawneekAIR> ok thanks for the advice guys.
[06:54:43] <mukesh> No john-dev
[06:54:58] <mukesh> I want to track the exact time spend by user on particular website
[06:55:15] <john-dev> so, wihtout cookie tracking you will loose that information on page reload
[06:55:18] <john-dev> no chance..
[06:55:20] <mukesh> like if he is on particualr domain and doing some stuff track that time
[06:55:24] <ceramicskull> mukesh - http://clicky.com/
[06:55:40] <mukesh> if he moves to other tab then after 10 sec stop time
[06:55:43] <mukesh> automatically
[06:55:47] <mukesh> something like that
[06:55:56] <mukesh> i will do server side hit to store the time
[06:55:58] <mukesh> if possible
[06:55:59] <taplar> heh, i keep thinking this is very big brother
[06:56:15] <mukesh> http://screentime.parsnip.io/
[06:56:17] <ceramicskull> hello Taplar
[06:56:22] <john-dev> mukesh: even serversided, you need to track the user -> cookies (sessions)
[06:56:23] <taplar> aloha
[06:56:26] <mukesh> something like that but i don't think it will work
[06:57:54] <taplar> localStorage and sessionStorage are also an option with cookies
[06:58:20] <mukesh> i can use localStorage but how to detect when user move to other tab
[06:58:29] <mukesh> that time i need to stop timer
[06:58:39] <taplar> you'd know when that other page loads
[06:58:45] <taplar> or the page they're on unloads
[06:58:56] <taplar> but if you mean tab already open and they switch to it, idk
[06:59:10] <taplar> unless there's a focus event on the body/html
[06:59:33] <mukesh> hmmmm
[06:59:42] <mukesh> looking bit messy
[06:59:51] <taplar> certainly involved in the least
[06:59:52] <mukesh> if some type of third party which can do it would
[06:59:54] <mukesh> be great
[06:59:59] <mukesh> anyone have any idea
[07:00:12] <john-dev> mukesh: ceramicskull: mukesh - http://clicky.com/
[07:00:17] <john-dev> this looks good
[07:00:58] <ceramicskull> taplar: so I need to create a custom method to let the user know exactly what the error is when creating a password. I'm looking at this - http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod and this is my current validation http://jsfiddle.net/nLnpw8eL/ - essentially I just want to let the user know if they forgot a capitol or a special char, etc... I just don't know where to start in terms of being so specific
[07:01:22] <mukesh> let me check john-dev
[07:01:26] <mukesh> and get back to you
[07:01:27] <mukesh> :)
[07:05:20] <ceramicskull> Is this something that a regex can handle?
[07:05:35] <Cork> sure
[07:06:45] <taplar> what's the password requirements?
[07:07:37] <ceramicskull> One capital, a number and small letters
[07:07:55] <ceramicskull> 8 - 24 chars
[07:08:26] <taplar> (atleast)One capital?
[07:08:49] <Cork> /[a-z]/ /[A-Z]/ /[0-9]/ /.{8,24}/
[07:09:04] <ceramicskull> yea at least
[07:09:20] <Cork> that should catch all the cases
[07:09:27] <Cork> separately as you asked for
[07:09:42] <Cork> hmm the last one is wrong though
[07:09:54] <Cork> /^.{8,24}$/}
[07:10:00] <Cork> ...
[07:10:03] <Cork> /^.{8,24}$/
[07:10:07] <taplar> :)
[07:10:35] <taplar> interesting, so for the regex providing multiple of them constitutes a logical and?
[07:10:56] <Cork> no
[07:11:00] <taplar> or would those have to be applied one at a time
[07:11:06] <Cork> as he want to run separate messages for each case
[07:11:11] <taplar> gotcha
[07:11:14] <Cork> you have to have separate tests
[07:11:35] <Cork> they could fairly easy be combined into one test
[07:11:45] <Cork> but then you would just get "Password is invalid" :)
[07:12:39] <ceramicskull> Cork correct, currently it just says "Password is invalid"
[07:12:47] <ceramicskull> or actually, just shows a red box lol
[07:13:26] <taplar> if the requirements are visible, and they should know what they just typed, that can be enough, :)
[07:14:00] <ceramicskull> Yea, but I have so many users that drop off, even with a show password
[07:14:24] <Cork> ceramicskull: why not just implement a password generator?
[07:14:36] <Cork> give them an easy button to generate a valid password for them
[07:15:06] <ceramicskull> but then they would have to change it later no?
[07:15:15] <taplar> optional
[07:15:16] <Cork> no
[07:15:26] <Cork> if you have a show password
[07:15:43] <ceramicskull> that's true
[07:15:44] <Cork> they could just opt to pick the one you provided (over ajax) or set there own
[07:16:50] <ceramicskull> I probably would rather do that than the exact error of the password... seems a lot more simpler and would work better. I just hope users would remember to save it T_T
[07:17:05] <Cork> well you prob need both anyway
[07:17:18] <Cork> but it would lower the bar quite a bit
[07:17:21] <taplar> are they giving you an email address?
[07:17:26] <taplar> you could mail it to them
[07:17:44] <mukesh> hey taplar something like that
[07:17:45] <mukesh> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/time-tracker/mokmnbikneoaenmckfmgjgjimphfojkd?hl=en
[07:17:48] <mukesh> is possible
[07:17:49] <Cork> they would prob have to change that one though
[07:17:59] <ceramicskull> They are giving email addresses
[07:18:09] <taplar> uh, that look like a chrome plugin...
[07:18:16] <mr_pinc> Anyone have an idea of how i can deal with a jQuery ui 'droppable' when my container zoom is not equal to 1
[07:18:26] <mr_pinc> I've figured out how to take care of the draggables
[07:18:53] <Cork> taplar: better? https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/mind-the-time/ :D
[07:19:11] <taplar> lol
[07:19:17] <mukesh> yes
[07:19:23] <mukesh>  i need also that in chrome plugin
[07:19:29] <mukesh> as i am creating chrome extension
[07:19:40] <mukesh> it use javascript and jquery
[07:19:51] <mukesh> so if possible what they use or how
[07:19:58] <mukesh> as i am newbie to chrome extension
[07:19:59] <mukesh> :)
[07:20:00] <Cork> <- doesn't know the origin of the conversation ^^'
[07:20:08] <taplar> oh, i thought you were building something for an actual site
[07:20:13] <taplar> same
[07:20:31] <mukesh> hmm
[07:20:43] <mukesh> no i need to integrate that in chrome extension somehow
[07:20:47] <Cork> i don't even know what you've asked for >_>
[07:21:05] <mukesh> sorry for that guys
[07:21:15] <mukesh> i didn't let you guys know before
[07:21:25] <Cork> na, you've most likely told someone, i just jumped in :D
[07:21:27] <mukesh> but it's pretty straight now
[07:21:41] <mukesh> taplar : any idea
[07:22:03] <taplar> i'm the same as Cork.  not exactly sure what your asking for.  other than a plugin that keeps track of time spent on a website
[07:22:54] <Cork> mukesh: if you're asking for how i would implement it i would do it through just binding the page tab load tab destroy events
[07:23:05] <Cork> and diff the date object on destroy
[07:23:14] <Cork> store the unix time difference
[07:23:19] <Cork> and you would have all you need
[07:23:28] <Cork> well possibly track tab changes
[07:23:43] <taplar> iirc, he also wants to handle on if they switch to another tab
[07:23:52] <mukesh> yes right taplar
[07:24:05] <Cork> what i said the last then :)
[07:24:13] <Cork> the browsers fire events for when that happen
[07:24:41] <Cork> so on the event for when the page loses focus you calculate the time
[07:24:51] <Cork> and when it gets back you take a new date stamp
[07:24:57] <Cork> its quite easy
[07:25:18] <mukesh> one more scranrio
[07:25:28] <motaka2> Cork: How are you ?
[07:25:33] <Cork> fine
[07:25:37] <mukesh> let's he is watching video or downloading from that websigte
[07:25:37] <motaka2> cool
[07:25:40] <Cork> first day back after semester :)
[07:25:46] <mukesh> and then move to other tab
[07:25:57] <mukesh> that case it won't count time
[07:26:02] <Cork> three glories weeks ^^
[07:26:03] <motaka2> Cork: Yupe. Ypou  helped me a lot in past
[07:26:20] <mukesh> i need to track as well if something is going on or not on that website opened tab
[07:26:25] <motaka2> you*
[07:26:40] <mukesh> any idea
[07:26:41] <Cork> mukesh: that will be MUCH harder
[07:26:46] <mukesh> hmmm
[07:26:54] <Cork> cause that wouldn't be related to the tab at all
[07:27:00] <mukesh> agree
[07:27:13] <Cork> you would have to check the network stack for activity towards the domain
[07:27:21] <Cork> and i don't even think chrome exposes that
[07:27:29] <mukesh> so anything else which will help me out
[07:27:55] <Cork> i don't see this as jquery related at all actually
[07:28:06] <Cork> you should prob look for a chrome extension channel instead
[07:28:13] <Cork> as you have to look for chrome api/events
[07:28:17] <mukesh> i didn't found any channel for that
[07:28:20] <mukesh> if you know let me know
[07:28:24] <mukesh> so i can ask ther
[07:28:27] <mukesh> there :)
[07:29:21] <cordovafan8> Hi. I've got a jquery mobile 1.3 application and I'm looking to make a 'background overlay' similar to what you might see on stock images. Basically I have a production and development version and I want to put a big overlay on it that says development. How can I make an overlay that appears in front but doesn't interfere with anything?
[07:29:48] <cordovafan8> or even just conditionally add an element to every page by default.
[07:29:56] <Cork> mukesh: you could try asking if anyone in #chrome-devtools know of a channel
[07:29:56] <mukesh> cork did you found any
[07:30:12] <mukesh> okay thank cork i will go that channel and aks
[07:30:18] <Cork> but ya, most of googles forums/irc channels are dead
[07:30:39] <mukesh> you are cool Cork
[07:30:42] <mukesh> thanks again
[07:30:47] <Cork> np
[07:30:58] <mentoc> How would I express in jquery: "When the user clicks on something other than me"?
[07:31:11] <Cork> you don't
[07:31:32] <Cork> you bind an event on document and check if the target was inside of the element you care about
[07:31:39] <mentoc> heres the scenario: I created a drop down. When someone clicks on the chevron, it drops down a menu. When someone clicks away from it I need to hide the drop down
[07:32:40] <Cork> ex. $(document).on('click', function(event) { if($(event.target).closest('selector-matching-the-target').length > 0) { return; } /* do something */ })
[07:34:01] <mentoc> ah nice
[07:38:22] <ceramicskull> Cork, so do I need to create a new method for each regex so it can return the exact error of the password? Or is it possible to just do || in one method?
[07:38:38] <ceramicskull> and then return which one was wrong?
[07:39:52] <Cork> ceramicskull: i think there is a method that lets you return custom validation strings
[07:40:04] <Cork> but addMethod needs a separate function for each message
[07:40:55] <ceramicskull> yea, hmm I figured it was that.
[07:41:56] <guyz> this may be more js instead of jquery; but i'm trying to validate an integer (currently using parseInt(value,10)===value) but something like "12test" passes when i'd expect it to fail;
[07:42:21] <Cork> guyz: you want to use regex
[07:42:38] <Cork> parseInt is meant to try to get a number as long as it is at all possible
[07:43:01] <Cork> /^[0-9]$/.test(value) is a better option
[07:43:03] <guyz> ahh so it sees a number and is like, here you go
[07:43:09] <Cork> opps
[07:43:16] <Cork> /^[0-9]*$/.test(value) is a better option
[07:43:33] <guyz> thanks
[07:43:39] <Cork> uh, wait a min
[07:44:03] <Cork> parseInt("12test", 10) === "12test" can't possibly be true
[07:44:14] <Cork> the regex is still the better solution, but...
[07:47:37] <guyz> i'll go for the regex, but yea my function is function isInteger(s){return parseInt(s,10)===s;} which returns true with "12test"
[07:48:22] <Cork> js> isInteger(s){return parseInt(s,10)===s;} print(isInteger("12test"))
[07:48:26] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[07:48:36] <Cork> humf
[07:49:01] <Cork> lol
[07:49:06] <Cork> js> function isInteger(s){return parseInt(s,10)===s;} print(isInteger("12test"))
[07:49:10] <b-ot> Cork: false
[07:49:24] <Cork> guyz: doesn't seams like it
[07:49:29] <guyz> hmm interesting
[07:51:35] <cordovafan8> what is a nice way to visually indicate a development version of a jquery mobile application? I'd like to just read a variable and display something on every page, but doing so in deviceready doesn't work, and I would like to avoid plastering code everywhere (for each page)
[07:51:49] <guyz> oh i see whats going on, some other test code i was doing to my value was just parseInt(value) prior to submitting to that function
[07:52:28] <guyz> cordovafan8:: put a "beta" snipe in the top left via css?
[07:53:08] <guyz> cordovafan8:: then add that css class to your body when the variable is true or whatevr
[07:54:00] <cordovafan8> guyz: what do you mean via css? Wouldn't i have to add an element to each 'page' in the html?
[07:54:16] <mdev> "content": {"app_token": "test","user": "test"};
[07:54:20] <mdev> what isn't valid about that
[07:55:13] <guyz> cordovafan8:: http://codepen.io/eode9/pen/twkKm  and you'd just include with your main.js a function that reads for the variable and adds the classes to the body tag
[07:55:35] <guyz> or injected an element
[07:56:07] <guyz> i think .append or some other jquery function
[07:57:55] <cordovafan8> guyz: unfortunately I'm using multiple html documents, so there will be multiple 'body' tags, and I use a series of delegates to build each 'page', so I would have to add the appends everywhere, which is not great.
[07:59:55] <guyz> cordovafan8:: hmm, well do you only have one nav/header? if you understand the general concept i'm sure you could figure something out with just a handful of lines in your main js file
[08:00:50] <cordovafan8> unfortunately no, but what I'm going to try to do is a pagebeforecreate bind on [data-role=page]
[08:18:14] <steedp3> Hi, I am doing a POST request to a cross domain server which responds with the headers: https://pastee.org/wug5d , when I then look at the cookies set for that domain, there are none, what am I doing wrong?
[08:19:15] <steedp3> I am doing $.post("exmaple.com/auth", "t=xxx.xxx.xxx", function () { /*insert iframe that needs the cookie set to load*/ })
[08:31:34] <cordovafan8> is there a way to get sub-elements of $(this) ?
[08:31:48] <cordovafan8> something like $(this).('#id').action()
[08:32:20] <robertmaxrees> .find(), but i wouldn’t use it to find an ID.
[08:33:26] <cordovafan8> what about $('#id', this).action() ?
[08:33:32] <cordovafan8> is this also not advised?
[08:33:42] <robertmaxrees> that uses .find() under the hood.
[08:33:44] <robertmaxrees> same difference.
[08:33:59] <cordovafan8> having some trouble actually matching an element that may or may not exist on a page
[08:34:39] <robertmaxrees> $(‘#id’) is what you want to do - that’ll be the fastest.
[08:34:44] <robertmaxrees> what are you doing that’ll cause errors?
[08:36:45] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/WLPQnnuq  << This is in my document ready function. I'm trying to add an 'indicator' to each page.
[08:37:02] <cordovafan8> the problem being that I have multiple html files, so I can't just match one 'page' or 'body' etc
[08:37:07] <cordovafan8> and I'd like to keep the code centralized
[08:37:23] <robertmaxrees> so if that element doesn’t exist?
[08:37:28] <cordovafan8> yes
[08:37:31] <robertmaxrees> because that would be if (!$('#id').length) {
[08:37:38] <robertmaxrees> no need for $(‘#id’, this)
[08:38:52] <robertmaxrees> if that doesn’t work, pop a console log in there to make sure it’s actually firing.
[08:40:44] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: what's showing up is multiples of the indicator, so I think it's firing, but not finding it correctly. (I think)
[08:41:14] <robertmaxrees> that means it’s firing multiple times :)
[08:41:33] <robertmaxrees> that means pagebeforeshow is firing more than you think it is.
[08:42:02] <robertmaxrees> and your check isn’t working for some reason.  is this ID on the page more than once?
[08:42:24] <steedp3> Hi, I am doing a POST request to a cross domain server which responds with the headers: https://pastee.org/wug5d , When I insert an iframe into the page from the same domain, the iframe page is not requested with the cookie set, what am I doing wrong?
[08:42:35] <steedp3> I am doing $.post("exmaple.com/auth", "t=xxx.xxx.xxx", function () { /*insert iframe that needs the cookie set to load*/ })
[08:44:38] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: no, the id is only added by that function at all. What I see is the indicator will display once on the main page, then I navigate to another page (which displays the indicator only once always), then back to the 'main' page and it displays the indicator twice now. Repeat and the number goes up.
[08:44:51] <cordovafan8> I think you are right about there being an extra element in there somehow, but I don't know how
[08:45:00] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 are you using $(‘#id’, this) still?
[08:45:59] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: yes, removing it and using just '#id' gives the indicator ONLY on the main page and no others
[08:46:02] <cordovafan8> very strange
[08:46:09] <robertmaxrees> cordovafan8 right, because it’s one page.
[08:46:13] <robertmaxrees> you’re using jquery mobile, right?
[08:46:15] <robertmaxrees> SPA style?
[08:46:45] <cordovafan8> not spa
[08:46:52] <cordovafan8> multiple html files
[08:46:59] <robertmaxrees> but they’re getting ajaxed in, right?
[08:47:27] <cordovafan8> I want to say yes, but I'm not 100%. I click a link, it goes to the delegate. I don't explicitly call any ajax
[08:47:39] <robertmaxrees> JQM is doing that for you :)
[08:47:42] <robertmaxrees> try this: swap to using a class, then use $(this).find(‘.yourClass’);
[08:47:46] <robertmaxrees> see if that fixes your problem.
[08:50:08] <cordovafan8> robertmaxrees: same effect unfortunately
[08:50:26] <cordovafan8> so it seems it is spa
[08:50:35] <cordovafan8> which is whack
[08:50:39] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[08:50:59] <robertmaxrees> that’s actually kind of a good thing, just requires a different plan of attack.
[08:51:18] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to run through how you wired stuff up and make sure you’re not reusing IDs and stuff.
[08:51:27] <robertmaxrees> check to make sure $(this) is what you think it is, etc.
[08:54:42] <Jake_> I'm not really sure how this "contact" system works, but I had a question about the "hashchange" event post, where the class on the links change with the #
[08:55:05] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 just ask your question :)
[08:55:45] <Jake_> I'm not a web designer, i'm just trying to put a website together for a college group, so my very basic question is: should this code be a separate javascript file that i connect to it or does it go directly into the code?
[08:55:53] <robertmaxrees> err, Jake_ hah.
[08:56:06] <robertmaxrees> Jake_ it should go in a separate file that you link.
[08:56:24] <Jake_> ok, sounds good. this is exactly what I was looking for, so thanks!
[08:56:30] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[08:56:51] <dude999> hello robert we meet agian
[08:56:55] <dude999> again
[08:57:10] <dude999> i been looking for u
[08:57:16] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:57:30] <dude999> yes i met u once here
[08:57:40] <robertmaxrees> okay - why for me specifically?  lots of people are available to help :)
[08:58:21] <dude999> hmmm :)
[08:59:11] <dude999> anyway by the help of my senior dev now my code has come to this and it still has some challenge in there would u please help me and look it up?
[08:59:19] <dude999> i would never forget u bro
[08:59:25] <robertmaxrees> dude999 ask your question to the channel.
[08:59:31] <robertmaxrees> i don’t remember your problems sooo... ;)
[08:59:39] <dude999> okay
[09:00:47] <dude999> robertmaxrees it will be a bit long for the challenge that i am facing though i will write it here but now i have to go to update my code on jsfiddle fir
[09:00:53] <dude999> first
[09:01:01] <robertmaxrees> break your probelm down.
[09:01:06] <robertmaxrees> one issue at a time.
[09:02:04] <dude999> yes
[09:02:26] <cordovafan8> grr
[09:06:30] <robertmaxrees> back.
[09:11:22] <dude999> hello okay now i have update my code on fiddle and
[09:11:44] <dude999> http://jsfiddle.net/meily/7j7xofn7/15/
[09:12:06] <robertmaxrees> woah
[09:13:09] <dude999> here is my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/meily/7j7xofn7/15/ and the thing now is that: 1. the form won't submit even when all required fields are completed correctly by user
[09:13:27] <robertmaxrees> dude999 http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[09:13:30] <robertmaxrees> read through this.
[09:13:35] <robertmaxrees> it’ll give you a lot of really good information.
[09:14:13] <dude999> thank you so much
[09:18:28] <dude999> robertmaxrees: anyway could u help me with the challenge
[09:19:00] <robertmaxrees> there are over 680 people in here :) as your specific questions.
[09:19:08] <robertmaxrees> try and figure out why it’s breaking.
[09:19:26] <robertmaxrees> instead of making me hunt through all your code.
[09:19:41] <robertmaxrees> that link i tossed out will give you a lot of really good tools to figure it out :)\
[09:20:15] <dude999> okay :)
[09:20:53] <robertmaxrees> i’ll bet your error object isn’t doing what you think it is, or something else is returning false that you don’t expect.
[09:23:50] <rindolf> hi all.
[09:24:21] <jamesdrawneekAIR> Can anyone recommend a live validation jquery library? So inputs get validated before submit
[09:24:35] <robertmaxrees> jamesdrawneekAIR jquery validate is a popular one that cane support that.
[09:24:37] <robertmaxrees> *can
[09:25:51] <jamesdrawneekAIR> robertmaxrees: Great thanks I'll look at that
[09:26:06] <dude999> the thing is that: On input file, if i return false; when user choose file that i enable them to upload, the form will submitted without waiting for other fields that are required being left blank.
[09:26:26] <robertmaxrees> dude999 huh?
[09:28:20] <dude999> robertmaxrees: bro u know on these line else if($(this).hasClass('input-file')){ 						var fileExtension = ['jpg','jpeg','png']; 						var file = $('.input-file').val().split('.').pop().toLowerCase(); 						if(file == ''){                         	$('.upload-file .error-msg').remove();                             $('.upload-file').append('<label class="error-msg">Please choose file to upload</label>');                         }else 
[09:28:44] <robertmaxrees> dude999 woah don’t paste code into the channel - that’s really hard to read.
[09:28:54] <dude999> urgh am sorry i made mistake here
[09:28:58] <robertmaxrees> try use a debugger and/or console logs in your code.
[09:28:59] <robertmaxrees> trust me :)
[09:29:07] <robertmaxrees> that guide will help you out bigtime.
[09:29:12] <dude999> yes
[09:29:27] <dude999> how long will u stay here
[09:29:30] <dude999> robertmaxrees:
[09:29:51] <robertmaxrees> dude999 there are plenty of other people that will be able to help you all day - if i’m not available, somebody else will be :)
[09:30:12] <dude999> :)
[09:32:22] <onr> you can just find robert's personal phone number and call him whenever you have a jquery issue
[09:32:28] <robertmaxrees> heh
[09:32:49] <adv_> anyone knows how to get a unique url with lightbox on every link ?
[09:33:00] <robertmaxrees> adv_ come again?
[09:33:28] <adv_> i want to get a unique url when i click on a lightbox gallery item
[09:33:41] <robertmaxrees> and do what with it?
[09:34:34] <dude999> hello onr, yesterday i pm but seem like i could not reach u
[09:35:06] <robertmaxrees> dude999 you shouldn’t PM people without checking first in the channel - it defeats the point of having the channel when you do it :)
[09:35:22] <dude999> oh i see
[09:35:39] <dude999> thanks i won't do it next time
[09:36:17] <adv_> robertmaxrees: embed a disqus
[09:36:31] <adv_> discussion on each separate item
[09:36:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:37:06] <Eduardo> da
[09:37:30] <Eduardo> testing...
[09:37:37] <robertmaxrees> Eduardo we can see you :)
[09:37:51] <Eduardo> haha Hi :)
[09:40:00] <Eduardo> I am working on a very interesting project building a specialised data visualization team
[09:40:29] <Eduardo> I am currently looking for JavaScript ninjas
[09:40:40] <robertmaxrees> Eduardo  we appreciate it, but this isn’t the right place.
[09:41:47] <adv_> robertmaxrees: deep linking
[09:42:17] <robertmaxrees> adv_ oh.  okay - you can use pushstates to change the URL in relatively modern browsers.
[09:42:23] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, use window.location.hash
[09:42:28] <robertmaxrees> and go from there.
[09:44:04] <Eduardo> Okay, sure. Just trying to be creative. I am actually still in university studying comp science. But thanks for your time
[09:44:08] <adv_> robertmaxrees: not sure i understand, is there a guide for this?
[09:44:20] <robertmaxrees> adv_ MDN is a good resource.
[09:44:39] <adv_> no, for the specific thing
[09:44:45] <robertmaxrees> adv_ not really.
[09:51:43] <dominic1134> i have a form which dynamically adds new input fields, upon previous choices via ajax.  on submit i want to remove the 'disabled' prop from ALL inputs.  somehow this only works on the elements which have not been created via ajax.  any clues?
[09:52:37] <robertmaxrees> dominic1134 what does the code look like that’s removing them?
[09:53:52] <dominic1134> robertmaxrees, $('form').submit(function( event ) { $('input').prop('disabled', false); }
[09:54:05] <robertmaxrees> are the new inputs actual <input> elements?
[09:54:34] <dominic1134> robertmaxrees, it actually works for the inputs which had been there from the beginning, but not on those which were dynamically added via ajax
[09:55:05] <robertmaxrees> dominic1134 right, i read that part, but since i can’t see your code i have to ask a bunch of questions ;)
[09:55:09] <robertmaxrees> mind sharing what you’ve got in a fiddle?
[09:58:16] <dominic1134> robertmaxrees, i would but it's pretty complicated.  also i'm using a bootstrap form validation library. the html are some thousand lines,  as well as the js is pretty complex..  i'll see if i can break it down to the important things
[09:59:20] <robertmaxrees> i just need the stuff for the ajax call and the bit adding the new inputs.
[10:04:47] <dominic1134> robertmaxrees, http://www.bootply.com/DZNdbHqPy4   it's a lil bit a mess due some of laravels blade templating variables are still present
[10:06:40] <dominic1134> lol, looks my code fucked up boot ply
[10:07:17] <Jake_> ok, so i need help. how do i get something like this: http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-hashchange/examples/hashchange/ with jquery 1.9+?
[10:08:15] <robertmaxrees> Jake_ you don’t - you just use the hashchange event
[10:08:26] <robertmaxrees> dominic1134 where’s the code?
[10:08:29] <robertmaxrees> that page is blank for me.
[10:08:59] <Jake_> oh, ok. thanks.
[10:09:06] <dominic1134> robertmaxrees, seems bootply didn't like my code.  i'm just looking for an alternative
[10:09:15] <robertmaxrees> dominic1134 bpaste.
[10:09:56] <Jake_> but for the hashchange, i'm not reloading the rest of the page. will it still work?
[10:10:41] <robertmaxrees> Jake_ huh?  hashchange fires whenever the hash changes.
[10:10:44] <robertmaxrees> not on pageload.
[10:11:27] <Jake_> ok, thanks again. sorry for the stupid questions. this is my first project
[10:11:44] <robertmaxrees> not stupid at all :)
[10:11:45] <robertmaxrees> it’s fine.
[10:14:17] <dominic1134> robertmaxrees, thanks https://bpaste.net/show/b0f7bbdd81f8
[10:14:24] <robertmaxrees> woahj.
[10:14:29] <robertmaxrees> uh... i just need the js.
[10:14:36] <dominic1134> :D
[10:14:41] <robertmaxrees> just the bits that add to the form and stuff
[10:15:10] <dominic1134> basically it's the first js block
[10:15:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:15:40] <robertmaxrees> that’s over 120 lines.
[10:16:01] <dominic1134> I'll tear it down
[10:16:20] <robertmaxrees> a self-contained example would be best - linking to that much code doesn’t really do much.
[10:16:28] <dominic1134> ok
[10:16:35] <robertmaxrees> also, check out http://fixingthesejquery.com
[10:16:40] <robertmaxrees> that might be a big help to you.
[10:18:11] <guyz> hey, so i've got an svg image that i need to interact with, when i paste the <svg> code directly into the page i'm able to use $("#groupid")on("click" and everything is perfect; but when i programatically take an <img src="whatever.svg"> and use jquery to inject the data into the dom; i'm unable to interact with any of the id's
[10:20:25] <robertmaxrees> guyz you need to use delegation.
[10:20:31] <robertmaxrees> or you need to bind after the image exists
[10:23:14] <guyz> yea i moved all my events to after the code that embeds the data with no success; and would i do something like $("svg").delegate("#id", "click" instead of $("#id").on("click" ?
[10:23:29] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[10:23:34] <robertmaxrees> use a parent element with .on()
[10:23:47] <robertmaxrees> $(‘.placeYouAreappendingTo’).on(‘click’, ‘img
[10:23:56] <robertmaxrees> $(‘.placeYouAreappendingTo’).on(‘click’, ‘img’, function() {});
[10:25:00] <guyz> i'm doing a replacewith if that makes a difference (so i'm taking my <img> tag and replacing it with the data contents; so would i use the parent wrapper?
[10:25:13] <robertmaxrees> still bind to the parent.
[10:25:23] <guyz> k i'll give it a shot here, sec
[10:25:35] <robertmaxrees> you’re basically removing the element, so you’re breaking the reference that you were bound to.
[10:27:36] <mr_pinc> Hello I've got a list of items arranged vertically - I want to be able to drag and drop those around in the same way you woudl see in a 'sortable' list - I also want to be able to drag the items to vertical list elsewhere on the page and have that list be sortable as well.  Anyone know of any examples demonstrating this?
[10:27:37] <guyz> nice, works great; thanks a bunch
[10:27:41] <guyz> robertmaxrees:: ^
[10:27:45] <robertmaxrees> guyz definitely.
[10:28:06] <robertmaxrees> mr_pinc if you have jquery ui, you want draggable and droppable
[10:33:03] <mr_pinc> robermaxrees:  I do - should I avoid sortable then and just do my own implementation?
[10:33:23] <robertmaxrees> you want to combine them, basically.
[10:33:33] <robertmaxrees> https://jqueryui.com/sortable/#connect-lists
[10:33:39] <robertmaxrees> sortable should actually get you most of the way there.
[10:34:50] <mr_pinc> does a sortable have to be a list?
[10:34:54] <mr_pinc> or can it just be a div?
[10:35:33] <robertmaxrees> should be easy enough to find out.
[10:43:27] <mr_pinc> robertmaxrees:  Only works with lists, but that's fine just change my markup - thanks for the tip
[10:43:35] <robertmaxrees> deffo.
[10:48:07] <guyz> don't mean to bug you or anything robertmaxrees, but i have a somewhat related issue where i want a regular html element (outside of the the svg/parent wrapper) to change the color of the clickable elemetns within the svg.
[10:49:07] <guyz> i'm currently using ('.mybutton').hover function $("#parentwrapper #clickelement").attr(
[10:49:44] <robertmaxrees> "#parentwrapper #clickelement" is unnecessary - you can only have an ID once per page - "#clickelement" is all you want.
[10:52:42] <guyz> cool, thx again :)
[11:13:04] <mr_pinc> Ok very strange - I apply sortable() to a list - It is workign fine, when i drag from list a -> list b it works fine - then when I drag from list b->a the elements have a slightly different layout from their original even though I've checked chrome and the computed styles are identical
[11:13:15] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[11:23:55] <mr_pinc> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/ubwtrstn/
[11:24:17] <mr_pinc> drag all items to the right "dock" then back to the left dock and you'll see what I'm talking about
[11:26:40] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ubwtrstn/1/
[11:28:28] <mr_pinc> just added the float:left?
[11:28:37] <robertmaxrees> and set it to display: block;
[11:28:45] <sweb> is there any method for check is my browser support jquery 2.x ?
[11:29:01] <robertmaxrees> sweb what do you mean?
[11:29:22] <sweb> if (window.somthing === 'object') loadjq2x(); else loadjq1x();
[11:29:31] <robertmaxrees> just use 1x
[11:30:24] <sweb> robertmaxrees: if user has better browser why i dont check it and load 2x ?
[11:30:48] <robertmaxrees> because it’s a one-time hit and the difference won’t be large enough.
[11:30:56] <robertmaxrees> also keeps things easier for you.
[12:09:17] <ceramicskull> hola robertmaxrees
[12:12:11] <mr_pinc> question about sortable - is there a way to explicitly specify a drag/drop option.  what i mean is if I have app a and I use that as controller to drag and drop - so when I drag something in app A I want to fire an event so that App B show what happened in A
[13:15:13] <robertmaxrees> aaaah
[13:15:19] <robertmaxrees> full of beer and pizza. fantastic lunch
[13:18:39] <Chameleon_> Does anyone use Highcharts? I’m trying to get rid of the space character between numbers over 1000 when viewing the tooltip (hover over the chart): http://jsfiddle.net/highcharts/PwEnd/
[13:19:06] <Chameleon_> Not sure why the default is to have a space between? Unless that is the standard in other countries (I’m in the UK).
[13:19:58] <Chameleon_> I know this isn’t really the right place to ask this but wasn’t sure where else to go, the highcharts channel seems dead..
[13:20:03] <robertmaxrees> http://www.highcharts.com/docs/chart-concepts/labels-and-string-formatting
[13:20:55] <robertmaxrees> also: http://stackoverflow.com/a/29209562/923919
[13:24:31] <Chameleon_> robertmaxrees Awesome! Thanks for that. No idea why I couldn’t find that, I’ve been Googling for 10 minutes O.o
[13:24:40] <robertmaxrees> my gogle-fu is strong.
[13:24:48] <mdev> robert bing with me
[13:24:50] <mdev> let's bing together
[13:24:53] <Chameleon_> haha, or mine is incredibly weak today..
[13:24:55] <robertmaxrees> noooooo
[13:24:56] <robertmaxrees> no bing

[13:28:33] <AliG1000> Hi - I am able to Ctrl+left and Ctrl+right to move between cells in a table, but I can't type in the cells http://jsfiddle.net/pbe4sj9z/5/  How can I change this?
[13:29:01] <robertmaxrees> return false;
[13:29:24] <robertmaxrees> remove that, problem solved.
[13:31:21] <AliG1000> that did it! thank you :)
[13:31:57] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:32:57] <gambl0re> hey playboy...
[13:57:13] <AliG1000> I found a problem with http://jsfiddle.net/pbe4sj9z/8/  When there is a drop-down, I can use Ctrl+(any arrow key), the value of the drop-down box changes, which is not desired.
[13:57:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to use e.preventDefault() if the element you’re “leaving” is a dropdown.
[14:02:17] <AliG1000> I'll try and figure out where to write this :)
[14:44:59] <TeckniX> jquery, y u no haz proper documentation? you say calls are deprecated yet they’re on the list of your API docs:
[14:45:00] <TeckniX> http://api.jquery.com/Ajax_Events/
[14:45:15] <TeckniX>  vs http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[14:47:45] <robertmaxrees> “deprecated” means they’re there, but they discouraged use.
[14:47:53] <robertmaxrees> the docs keep around the documentation until they’re removed.
[14:57:20] <AliG1000> I've tried a bunch of ways and still cannot work out how to put in  e.preventDefault()   :(
[14:57:44] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:00:37] <odigem> Hi
[15:00:56] <AliG1000> (javascript is not my strong suit...)
[15:00:56] <odigem> how to drop previous event handler?
[15:01:33] <odigem> or hot to set event handler  to not exists element
[15:01:39] <odigem> how*
[15:01:55] <robertmaxrees> odigem there’s an .off(), but there are usually better ways to handle those situations.
[15:02:46] <fas3r> hello
[15:02:51] <odigem> robertmaxrees: how to use it?
[15:03:00] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery off
[15:03:01] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: .off() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/off/
[15:03:06] <odigem> .off( "click", "**" );  ok?
[15:03:13] <robertmaxrees> check the docs.
[15:03:40] <odigem> not work
[15:03:48] <robertmaxrees> check the docs.
[15:03:59] <robertmaxrees> they’ll show you exactly what you need to do odigem :)
[15:04:38] <odigem> off() works fine
[15:04:47] <odigem> finally
[15:05:02] <robertmaxrees> why are you removing an evening binding?
[15:06:03] <odigem> i bind some action on tag when i press the tag event set again and i got geometric progression of events :D
[15:06:16] <robertmaxrees> errr, don’t re-bind listeners.
[15:06:24] <odigem> i need
[15:06:30] <robertmaxrees> why?
[15:06:38] <odigem> because i no have any data from start
[15:06:45] <robertmaxrees> then use a single delegated listener.
[15:06:48] <odigem> i must get data then set listeners
[15:07:08] <odigem> <div id="container"></div> my code
[15:07:15] <odigem> i cant set listener to "a"
[15:07:23] <odigem> its not work
[15:07:32] <robertmaxrees> right, so use a delegated one - $(‘#container’).on(‘click’, ‘a’, function() {});
[15:07:49] <odigem> O.o
[15:08:27] <odigem> fk
[15:08:32] <odigem> i'm js noob
[15:25:16] <arc_> i didn't know you could also use ‘’ as quotes
[15:51:14] <odigem> how to use continue in each function?
[15:55:34] <robertmaxrees> check if your thing matches a predicate - if so, operate against if, if not, do nothing.
[16:08:05] <teamcoltra> Hey guys, I am trying to figure out how to scale a div to be the height of it's background image.  When I google it, I keep getting information to scale the background image, but I don't want to do that.. I want to exand the div.
[16:09:14] <teamcoltra> the width is already set to 100% so the width of the image is already set, I just want to scale the div vertically in proportion to the width
[16:41:08] <mRCUTEO> hello
[16:41:29] <mRCUTEO> anyone knows how to pull jquery  $('#QRCodex').val(result['QRCode']); to a php page with an echo?
[16:41:43] <mRCUTEO> jquery data from json response
[16:41:44] <robertmaxrees> post or get it.
[16:42:55] <mRCUTEO> yep i already post it
[16:43:02] <mRCUTEO> to the same page
[16:43:14] <mRCUTEO> $x = $_POST['QRCodex']
[16:43:18] <mRCUTEO> nothing appears
[16:43:56] <robertmaxrees> how are you posting it?
[16:44:16] <robertmaxrees> what does your html look like?
[16:45:15] <mRCUTEO> i just add <html></html>
[16:45:20] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:45:26] <robertmaxrees> show me your code.
[16:45:32] <mRCUTEO> okay
[16:48:12] <mRCUTEO> robertmaxress: http://pastebin.com/dEWgzNZK
[16:48:19] <mRCUTEO> here's the code
[16:48:37] <robertmaxrees> that’s now how that works.
[16:49:00] <robertmaxrees> swap that data line for data: {QRCode: QRCode}
[16:49:23] <mRCUTEO> okay
[16:51:45] <mRCUTEO> already swap nothing appears
[16:52:08] <mRCUTEO> the data is success to post to the datacapture.php but not to same page
[16:52:28] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[16:52:45] <robertmaxrees> which part isn’t working?
[16:53:09] <mRCUTEO> i manage to get back the response from the datacapture.php
[16:53:21] <mRCUTEO> success:function(data){                     var result = $.parseJSON(data);                                  $('#QRCodex').val(result['QRCode']);
[16:53:23] <robertmaxrees> okay - so the success function fails?
[16:53:37] <mRCUTEO> the success function works
[16:53:54] <mRCUTEO> but i couldnt pull the data $QRCodex to my page via echo php
[16:54:12] <robertmaxrees> right, you’re trying to post data and PHP isn’t seeing it, right?
[16:55:23] <mRCUTEO> yes
[16:55:28] <mRCUTEO> absolutely correct
[16:55:55] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you console.log(QRCode); right before the ajax call?
[16:57:21] <robertmaxrees> because it looks like you need to make the change to data that i pointed out, then $QRCodex = $_POST['QRCodex']; becomes $QRCodex = $_POST['QRCode'];
[16:58:39] <mRCUTEO> console says undefined
[16:58:53] <mRCUTEO> var QR = result.QRCode; 			 alert(console.log(QR));
[16:58:58] <robertmaxrees> err.
[16:59:01] <robertmaxrees> don’t use alert.
[16:59:04] <robertmaxrees> console.log() instead.
[16:59:16] <mRCUTEO> i try capture the QR via result.QRCode
[16:59:25] <mRCUTEO> oh ok
[16:59:32] <robertmaxrees> open your dev tools.

[18:18:45] <jak2000> hi all i want create a fiddle based on this sample: https://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form   but cant here my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/tno3dynz/  anyone can try help me? thanks
[19:19:23] <dude999> hello
[20:04:30] <Whirled> hey all. Does anybody know of a super lightweight animation library that could emulate a wooden sign dropping down from off the screen?
[20:19:27] <jak2000> in a hidden html field: <input type="hidden" id="wkgscan" name="wkgscan" value="0">    how to change the alue with .val  or with .text or with .html?  thanks
[20:20:09] <Whirled> .val() changes the value...try it in jsfiddle.
[20:23:03] <jak2000> Whirled: http://jsfiddle.net/jamiguel77/7ofbswcc/2/  can you try: click on show  modal button and then click on Cancel and then again Showmodal? why not reopen the form?
[20:28:34] <Whirled> here's what'shappening
[20:28:45] <Whirled> You are destroying the dialog you create when you cancel
[20:28:53] <Whirled> so there's nothing to re-open
[20:36:39] <Whirled> also, when you do form[0].reset() you are messing things up. Try this: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/7ofbswcc/6/
[20:50:02] <Whirled> jak2000, what are you trying to do?
[20:58:52] <dsdeiz> hey all so say i have $('.foo .child:gt(5)').hide(); is it possible to check each .foo if their children is greater than 5?
[21:00:37] <dsdeiz> something like $('.foo').has('5 elements').append('Foobar');
[21:05:06] <jak2000> Whirled thanks
[21:05:08] <jak2000> are you there?
[21:05:45] <Whirled> one min...
[21:07:03] <Whirled> dsdeiz, try $(".foo").children(":gt(5)")  not sure though...
[21:07:44] <fjnimp> dsdeiz, https://api.jquery.com/children/
[21:08:30] <Whirled> jak2000, what's up?
[21:24:31] <jak2000> Whirled not know whyi show my dialog form and sho but immediatly reload the page(submit) how to find the error? thanks
[21:25:39] <Whirled> you have to capture the submit event on the form and stop it from submitting (which loads a new page).
[21:26:19] <Whirled> $("form").on("submit", function (e) { e.preventDefault(); ....});   that's stops the default submit behavior that reloads the page.
[21:27:44] <jak2000> ok cheking
[21:41:37] <jak2000> Whirled cant create a jsfiddle but here the pastie
[21:44:12] <jak2000> http://pastie.org/10357973 you see any bad code?
[21:46:03] <Uhkis> jak2000: never ever send sql like that
[21:47:26] <jak2000> why?
[21:47:50] <jak2000> recommend me plase advice me
[21:48:29] <Uhkis> jak2000: anyone could easily empty your whole database just by changing that line
[21:49:57] <Uhkis> jak2000: you should send the values to the backend script and that should build the (sanitized) query
[21:51:04] <jak2000> Uhkis have any link for read/learn?
[21:52:51] <jak2000> Uhkis and why when the user click on editar button line 135, show the dialog form and immediatly reload or submitt? thanks
[21:56:59] <Uhkis> use event.preventDefault() on the click handler
[22:00:14] <jak2000> check line 66
[22:00:34] <Uhkis> wrong handler
[22:01:17] <Uhkis> wait
[22:01:30] <Uhkis> #65 is broken anyways
[22:01:32] <jak2000> ok replace line 70 debugger; with: event.preventDefault()
[22:01:40] <jak2000> why is broken?
[22:01:47] <Uhkis> it should be #frm_mdf_editmov
[22:02:56] <jak2000> line 65 is: form = dialog1.find("frm_mdf_editmov").on("submit", function (event) {
[22:03:01] <jak2000> same as you say, not?
[22:03:12] <Uhkis> i said #frm_mdf_editmov
[22:03:37] <Uhkis> note the #
[22:04:16] <jak2000> oooo
[22:04:18] <jak2000> testing.
[22:09:18] <jak2000> similar  result
[22:09:21] <jak2000> other correction?
[22:15:55] <Uhkis> use preventDefault on the buttons click handler too
[22:19:06] <jak2000> ok, line 70(under line 70) i write: event.preventDefault();
[22:19:09] <jak2000> testing
[22:32:14] <OurRoyalGabe> I need to create a custom phone validation
[22:32:25] <OurRoyalGabe>  the one that is part of jQuery Validate works well enough for the first half
[22:32:38] <OurRoyalGabe> but I'd to have it automatically fix the ( )'s and allow for an Extension at the end
[22:33:04] <OurRoyalGabe> can anyone offer any insight or easy solution?
[22:48:10] <jak2000> Uhkis are you there?
[22:54:37] <Uhkis> somewhat
[23:00:11] <jak2000> fixed
[23:00:53] <jak2000> with your advice, not know why need the prevent... (because i use other dialog forms and worked fine)same as i pasted the code, of course, with the # after the form  :)
[23:01:29] <Uhkis> jak2000: now read about sql injections and fix that part of your code
[23:01:46] <jak2000> ok
[23:02:05] <jak2000> in jsp exist a topic: prepared statements.
[23:03:20] <Uhkis> just send the needed values to the jsp page and build the query there, never build the query on frontend side
[23:05:02] <jak2000> ok, understand..
[23:05:13] <jak2000> thanks working
[23:17:40] <jak2000> http://pastie.org/10358059 i have a table with id="myTable" when i do a click on a button(on a cell of the table): see line 76, it get correctly the value of the 8th cell, but when i try store back with a new value: line 116 not show it, which is wrong? thanks
[23:26:25] <Cork> jak2000: what you're doing there is a B-A-D!!! idea
[23:26:36] <Cork> don't accept random sql strings from client side!
[23:27:30] <Uhkis> Cork: already mentioned twice
[23:27:34] * Cork runs $.ajax("ajax/a_catalogos.jsp", { method: "post", data: { sqlSel: "drop table tpallent_m;" } })
[23:27:36] <Uhkis> also, welcome back!
[23:27:43] <Cork> thx
[23:29:27] <jak2000> Cork Welcome back, yes, Uhkis adviced me, tomorrow i change everithing... by moment how to change a value of a cell ?
[23:30:14] <Cork> jak2000: what do you get if you run console.log('#row' + $idMov) on line 115?
[23:32:28] <Kartagis> Cork: welcome back dude
[23:32:45] * Cork feels warm and fuzzy
[23:33:08] <jak2000> testing
[23:33:09] <Cork> so much love going around here today :D
[23:33:18] <Kartagis> Cork: I've been meaning to ask you. are you from Cork?
[23:33:22] <Kartagis> Ireland
[23:33:23] <Cork> no
[23:33:49] <Cork> the name is from a swedish song character
[23:33:59] <Cork> "Eugen Cork"
[23:34:41] <Cork> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3xHMunMNHQ
[23:35:02] <Cork> note i took the name 18 years ago :)
[23:35:31] <Kartagis> BBS times?
[23:36:26] <jak2000> Cork console say: #row7
[23:36:44] <Cork> hmm and what did you expect?
[23:37:03] <Cork> Kartagis: ya
[23:38:10] <jak2000> i expect:  $('#myTable').find('tr#row' + $idMov).find('td:eq(8)').html($xremext2);    chenge the value of the cell(8) of the row with id: #row7
[23:39:12] <Cork> jak2000: i meant what value did you expect in the field
[23:39:17] <Cork> or rather in the string
[23:40:07] <Cork> anyway if the id is correct you could just replace $('#myTable').find('tr#row' + $idMov) with $('#row' + $idMov)
[23:40:27] <Cork> no need for the rest of the selector, id's are unique
[23:46:17] <jak2000> Cork: http://pastie.org/10358096#11,154  my source code, and not changed the value: $('#row' + $idMov).find('td:eq(8)').html($xremext2);  where $xremext2="2222" i want change the 8th cell 7th row
[23:47:01] <Cork> jak2000: have you checked that the selector works?
[23:47:15] <Cork> and that $xremext2 has the correct value?
[23:47:22] <jak2000> checked
[23:47:26] <jak2000> but i recheck :)
[23:47:40] <Cork> console.log($('#row' + $idMov).find('td:eq(8)').length, $xremext2)
[23:50:00] <jak2000> ok in chrome i activated the debug mode F12, i go to tab Elements and here navigate to row7, and yes, is my Row that i want change
[23:50:04] <jak2000> checking the console
[23:52:50] <jak2000> say: 0 "1010"   the 1010 is the new value, but wasnt reflected on the table
[23:54:34] <Cork> jak2000: 0 means the selector doesn't find any matching element
[23:54:45] <Cork> so you don't have an element in the page with the id="row7"
[23:54:54] <jak2000> see the source code?
[23:55:01] <jak2000> http://pastie.org/10358096#11,154
[23:55:04] <Cork> the dom tells me :)
[23:55:36] <jak2000> ahhh i think found the error
[23:55:37] <Cork> jak2000: class= id <-- ugg
[23:55:38] <jak2000> see line 154
[23:55:41] <jak2000> clas empty :(
[23:55:47] <jak2000> yes
[23:55:54] <Cork> always quote values in html
[23:56:32] <Cork> jak2000: also ALIGN="CENTER" is deprecated use css instead
[23:56:46] <Cork> or rather align="anything"
[23:57:13] <jak2000> found the error: see my jsp code please: myCancelClass="";  if (rs.getInt("impallentstatus")==0) { myCancelClass="myCancelRow"; }
[23:57:34] <jak2000> the eval of the if is False, never store a class name...
[23:57:39] <Cork> jak2000: i would recommend running the page through w3c validator
[23:57:48] <Cork> it has quite long list of errors
[23:57:53] <jak2000> noooooo  :)
[23:58:15] <jak2000> ok
