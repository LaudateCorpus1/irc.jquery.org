[00:01:41] <Cork> EnginA: no, not yet
[00:01:55] <Cork> there's something on the way (though its not events)
[00:02:07] <EnginA> what is it
[00:08:45] <Cork> EnginA: don't have it on the top of my head right now
[00:08:49] <Cork> one min let me look
[00:09:22] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Hi, I have a jquery ui dialog and need to load dynamic data in there from a php script... what would be the best approach for this?
[00:09:25] <avinashrbhat> hi, all. can anyone tell me why there is a funny border for the spinner input in webkit while selecting it? http://jqueryui.com/spinner/
[00:09:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Also need to pass an ID to this PHP script, to retrieve the right data
[00:11:14] <Cork> EnginA: http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/MutationReplacement#Interface_Definition
[00:13:51] <benjick> Hey. Anyone know of jquery slider plugin like this? http://www.arper.com/en
[00:15:35] <avinashrbhat> hey, benjick, i guess you can use https://github.com/tkahn/Smooth-Div-Scroll
[00:15:48] <avinashrbhat> that may help you
[00:16:04] <benjick> thanks
[00:16:07] <benjick> i'll give it a look :)
[00:16:25] <avinashrbhat> k
[00:16:37] <EnginA> Cork: isn't that precisely defines what I asked for :)
[00:16:54] <Cork> EnginA: yes, but it's not supported in all browsers
[00:17:06] <Cork> that's why i said "not yet"
[00:17:14] <EnginA> yeah, yeah, I remember reading these long ago anyway, still not implemented in all
[00:17:37] <Cork> EnginA: last one to jump in as far as i know is webkit
[00:17:46] <EnginA> I couldn't decide what how to design something, that is buffling me.
[00:18:11] <EnginA> I'm developing this IDE, where user drag-n-drops components, configures them and then it "compiles" into a product.
[00:18:58] <EnginA> It's quite OK, I have a div#canvas, and after ripping some unncessary data from it, I just post that document, and that is my means of storing the user content.
[00:19:15] <EnginA> that's pretty neat, as I can retrieve the data from server and re-render it again very easily.
[00:19:43] <EnginA> but I also have additional configuration options regarding the document just designed by the end-user.
[00:20:11] <EnginA> I keep that cofniguration options in a separate node and it become a maintainance headache to post document and configuration separeately.
[00:20:20] <EnginA> so I thought maybe I could just store the configuration information in the docuemnt itself too
[00:20:28] <EnginA> i.e. <div id="canvas" data-x="foo">
[00:20:55] <EnginA> but I need to represent those attributes to the end user too, so that they can see and modify them...
[00:21:05] <EnginA> hence I came to the point of DOM manipulation events
[00:22:01] <EnginA> actually, XML and XSLT seems to be very close to what I want...
[00:22:07] <Cork> EnginA: hmm, actually that seams to have been depricated too :)
[00:22:14] <EnginA> what ?
[00:22:17] <Cork> latest revision seams to be http://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#mutation-observers
[00:22:19] <Cork> :)
[00:22:36] <EnginA> I'm not using mutation observers anyway
[00:22:37] <EnginA> atm
[00:23:27] <EnginA> I can always scan the DOM tree I'm interested in like 2 times/sec and detect the changes though, even though it is not scalable, it'll do the job for me
[00:23:35] <Cork> EnginA: well it brings support into all browsers now days actually
[00:23:43] <EnginA> as I'll just have, say, 100 nodes, which I'm interested in
[00:24:35] <EnginA> I'm sure it'll affect the reachability of the app anyway Cork
[00:24:49] <Cork> reachability?
[00:25:09] <EnginA> I mean, the audience that can use your app
[00:25:24] <EnginA> as new stuff is not supported by older browsers
[00:25:35] <Cork> well if you fallback to the other listener forms you get cross browser support
[00:25:45] <EnginA> next time I'll vote for a politician who promises to unify browser engines into ONE
[00:25:53] <EnginA> webkit is good and enough for all
[00:25:55] <Cork> LOL
[00:26:04] <Cork> i HOPE that won't ever happen
[00:26:13] <Cork> that would kill the market
[00:26:19] <EnginA> what market
[00:26:20] <Cork> (just see what happend with ie4)
[00:26:29] <Cork> the browser development market
[00:26:29] <EnginA> there's no market
[00:26:35] <EnginA> sure competition fuels innovation
[00:26:38] <Cork> if one "wins" there is no development anymore
[00:26:47] <EnginA> but the total cost of maintaining corss browser compatabiltiy is probably billion dollar
[00:27:09] <karstenk1977_> Cork, sorry, but I have this TypeError: obj is undefined [Bei diesem Fehler anhalten]        length = obj.length, again
[00:27:12] <EnginA> well, if google wins, they'll keep innovating probably to improve their services... ebcause they are solely a web company
[00:27:16] <karstenk1977_> http://steuerkanzlei.tom-develop.com/#!/405
[00:27:21] <Cork> that's cause of all the inconsistencies we have to live with cause of the last time a engine won
[00:27:45] <EnginA> obviously not true
[00:27:57] <Cork> EnginA: the history supports it
[00:29:00] <EnginA> I don't agree with your point.
[00:29:23] <EnginA> they just implemented stuff in a different way, how does it relate with monopoly
[00:29:35] <Cork> karstenk1977_: when and where do you get the error?
[00:29:55] <EnginA> though since IE got monopoly they introduced some weird shit stuff to their own and not followed specs
[00:30:06] <EnginA> then again, it's a matter of implementation differences
[00:30:17] <Cork> EnginA: that's exactly what webkit does now
[00:30:27] <karstenk1977_> ah i have fixed, now the problem is typo3. here wrong chat^^
[00:30:28] <Cork> only difference it that this time its css
[00:30:37] <Cork> (and its for mobile)
[00:31:06] <EnginA> well, it was not what you said... anyways it does not matter
[00:31:31] <Cork> EnginA: i said that it's getting better, but the fight has moved to a new position
[00:31:45] <EnginA> one browser engine, a democratic consortium is the way to go!
[00:31:52] <Cork> and what i said is that if there is one engine, innovation stopps
[00:32:08] <EnginA> not necessarily
[00:32:11] <EnginA> it'll slow down for sure
[00:32:25] <Cork> not necessarily but most likely
[00:32:26] <EnginA> but companies need new stuff, they just have to get it passed through consortium
[00:33:01] <EnginA> so everyone will benefit from it... it is so obvious and so much cheaper in the end
[00:33:24] <Cork> there isn't really a difference with what we have today
[00:33:32] <EnginA> oh really
[00:33:34] <EnginA> haha
[00:33:41] <Cork> only exception is things that they do that doesn't follow the standards
[00:33:43] <EnginA> there are, sort of, 4 major engines right now
[00:33:56] <EnginA> the market is fragmented as hell
[00:34:04] <Cork> in your world you would still have browsers that use a locally patched version thats 4 years old
[00:34:09] <Cork> and you would have the same problems again
[00:34:44] <EnginA> well, now we have different versions of four engines
[00:34:47] <Cork> if you don't think that would happen, just check how linux distros work
[00:34:54] <EnginA> anyway, this conversation is fruitless, i'm obviously right :D
[00:35:02] <Cork> heh
[00:35:28] <Cork> your ignoring many points, and simplifying the problem a bit to much, but each one to there liking
[00:36:47] <EnginA> the problem with XML+XSLT is that you cannot propagate back the modification on the rendered result back to XML
[00:36:51] <EnginA> here, think about that
[00:37:21] <Cork> and there should be something strange with that?
[00:37:39] <Cork> you can't propagate changes to html back to php either
[00:38:17] <EnginA> data (XML) -> presentation (XSLT)
[00:38:22] <EnginA> there should be the other way around too
[00:38:23] <Cork> i know
[00:38:32] <Cork> but its still two different sources
[00:38:34] <EnginA> i.e. xml -> XSLT -> HTML
[00:38:39] <EnginA> HTML -> shit -> XML
[00:38:56] <Cork> but xslt can modify the structure quite a bit
[00:38:59] <EnginA> preferrably shit and XSLT is one and viola... you have a fantastic thing going on there
[00:39:12] <Cork> so xslt modifying the xml is like php handling of database data
[00:39:19] <EnginA> none sense
[00:39:25] <Cork> O_o
[00:39:29] <EnginA> php can do any shit... XSLT is for one purpose
[00:39:38] <Cork> sigh
[00:40:02] <EnginA> this problem is a big one maybe, even Visual Studio couldn't solve it thoroughly
[00:40:43] <EnginA> I want to store my user designed docuemnt in a flexible format (XML) and represent it to the end user when necessary in HTML then let end user modify it and then store back in XML
[00:40:58] <EnginA> up until this point, I was using HTML for all of this, thanks to fantastic jquery
[00:41:13] <EnginA> but now it started to look cumbersome...
[00:41:29] <EnginA> maybe I should just go with only HTML... and improve my design
[00:41:54] <EnginA> at the moment, I'm retrieving user designed docuemnt in HTML and calling initialization functions of each element as necessary
[00:42:09] <EnginA> so it geenerates a totally drag-n-droppable elements on the canvas
[00:42:30] <EnginA> when I'm storing it, I'm ripping of generated content (such as drag-drop elements).
[00:43:20] <EnginA> yeah, this proved to be working just fine... only nuisance was the configuration data of the project... I have to figure that out
[00:43:44] <motox> Why is this an object?  According to the documentation, using attr() with one parameter returns a string.     $('#mydiv').each(function(i) { console.log(typeof $(this).attr('id')) } );
[00:44:43] <Cork> motox: where does the id come from?
[00:44:47] <zeroquake> hey , are there any open source jquery scroll bar plugins (which replaces the default scrollbar -- not content scrollbars)
[00:45:18] <EnginA> zeroquake: that would cause trouble with mobile devices most probably, think again
[00:45:22] <Cork> motox: btw each on an id selector makes little sense
[00:45:31] <Cork> motox: you can only ever have one anyway
[00:45:37] <zeroquake> site is pure desktop browser only ...
[00:45:51] <motox> cork:   <div id="mydiv><div id="foo></div> <div id="bar></div></div>
[00:46:03] <Cork> console.log(typeof $('#mydiv').attr('id'));
[00:46:08] <Cork> its stirng for me
[00:46:38] <motox> cork:  It returns object for me.  And I am unable to run .substr on it
[00:46:56] <Cork> motox: can you reproduce it in jsfiddle?
[00:47:29] <zeroquake> this http://joelb.me/scrollpath/   was the only open source one i cud find , but again i am unable to separate only scrollbar from it
[00:49:32] <motox> cork> Sure
[00:50:04] <EnginA> 5 bucks you'll see your mistake while preparing the test case :D
[00:50:28] <zeroquake> :P i jus wana use for my class assignment ... :P
[00:50:56] <zeroquake> as long as it runs fine in a browser i am fine :)
[00:51:18] <zeroquake> dat sounded weird !!
[00:51:47] <Chel> h
[00:56:54] <motox> EnginA> I owe you $5
[00:58:25] <motox> Cork> I figured it out.  It was for a dynamically generated table that was displaying data.  I was trying to pull the ID from the TR tags.  However, since it was dynamically generated, the browser added a <tbody> in the DOM, so that was element 0 in my each loop.  Since it had no ID, it returned the object
[00:59:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I have a dynamic amount of checkboxes... is it possible to retrieve the IDs of all selected ones, with jquery?
[01:00:01] <runtyrobot> Good morning guys and gals!
[01:00:10] <EnginA> gals ? come on.
[01:00:19] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: $('input:checked')
[01:00:20] <runtyrobot> I was trying to bring hope
[01:00:21] <EnginA> freenode can be renamed to sausagefest.net
[01:01:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cork: how would I pass that to an external php script?
[01:01:26] <Cork> ecky--ptang-zoob: eh, you can't pass that at all
[01:01:38] <Cork> you can send it through ajax if you want it on the server side
[01:01:47] <Cork> ?.post @ ecky--ptang-zoob
[01:01:47] <bot-t> ecky--ptang-zoob, jQuery.post(url, [data], [success], [dataType]): Load data from the server using a HTTP POST request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[01:02:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok
[01:02:23] <karstenk1977_> Cork?
[01:03:03] <karstenk1977_> Can you please have a llok, why the look and feel is so diffrent? http://steuerkanzlei.tom-develop.com/#!/405  :  http://jquerytools.org/demos/overlay/styling.html
[01:03:42] <karstenk1977_> the Tools script doesn´t set top and left from my overlay, but i cannot see whynot
[01:05:30] <Cork> karolyi: only guessing (i don't know that much about jquery tools), but i guess your missing some css there
[01:07:23] <karstenk1977_> mh, there is no animation, no triggered close button, think its more than css
[01:07:58] <Cork> might be a dependency or something
[01:08:16] <aguynamedben> hi, I'm building a drag and drop uploader similar to imgur.com.  I am trying to use $(document).mousenter() and $(document).mouseleave() to detect when the user has dragged the file into the page, or back out of the page. It seems those callbacks don't work when a file is being dragged though, is there something else I should use for that?
[01:08:21] <karstenk1977_> perhaps
[01:08:37] <anli> I am uploading a file using $.ajax, seems like the enctype becomes multipart/form-data, judging from firebugs output, however, on the server side, Request.Files becomes empty, the traffic looks like this: http://pastebin.com/rP0kNKeK
[01:09:04] <Cork> aguynamedben: you want to listen for the ondrag event
[01:09:13] <anli> Is the enctype showing in other ways than the format of the request? like in a header or something
[01:09:21] <anli> If there is a mismatch
[01:09:32] <Cork> ?mdc drag and drop @ aguynamedben
[01:09:36] <bot-t> aguynamedben, Drag and drop - DragDrop | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DragDrop/Drag_and_Drop
[01:10:10] <aguynamedben> ahh, thanks Cork I will take a look!
[01:14:19] <aguynamedben> Cork you a baller, my friend.  $(document).on('dragleave'… I was trying to $(document).dragleave() at first.  thank you so much!
[01:14:39] <aguynamedben> works great, I should use .on more so I know what's being abstracted
[01:15:03] <Cork> ya the shorthands is a bit tricky
[01:15:14] <Cork> and when there isn't one it becomes annoying quite fast
[01:15:47] <aguynamedben> yeah, I'm more of a backend guy, so I'd rather us .on() and learn more about what is actually happening with the jquery magic.  thanks man!
[01:15:48] <Cork> anli: so it's sent, you should prob ask in a channel for the server language your using
[01:15:54] <Cork> *you're
[01:16:23] <Cork> aguynamedben: well .on is still quite a bit of jquery magic :)
[01:16:38] <Cork> its just not wrapped in a function :)
[01:19:41] <anli> Can I set enctype of a $.ajax call?
[01:20:09] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Cork: When I do params.fileids = $('input:checked'); - it doesn't work
[01:20:50] <Cork> $.map($('input:checked'), function(elm) { return elm.id; });
[01:21:12] <Cork> that will give you an array though
[01:21:21] <ecky--ptang-zoob> an array with the ids?
[01:21:26] <Cork> yes
[01:21:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ahh
[01:22:04] <runtyrobot> I have an issue with IE8 (don't we all), with a function where i'm trying to do a .live('click', ... retrieve two .data() parameters and retrieve data via a $.post call. I keep getting a 'Object doesn't support this property or method'. (ugly jquery; http://jsfiddle.net/HceuB/)
[01:22:07] <runtyrobot> Any ideas?
[01:22:45] <karstenk1977_> Cork I didn´t find it
[01:22:58] <karstenk1977_> no idea why it looks diffrent
[01:23:02] <Cork> runtyrobot: what line?
[01:23:13] <Cork> karstenk1977_: no, sorry
[01:23:50] <Cork> ah wait ie8... do you even get a trustworthy line number..
[01:23:55] <runtyrobot> Cork; 46 - which is the fb_id = $('#fb_id').data('fbid'); one
[01:24:42] <Cork> runtyrobot: sidenote, you forgot to declare your variables
[01:25:42] <Cork> runtyrobot: do you have any other framework on the site?
[01:25:56] <runtyrobot> Javascript-wise, no
[01:26:24] <runtyrobot> I do use the twitter bootstrap ofcourse.. But that thing triggers just fine. Oddly enough.
[01:26:25] <Cork> and $('#fb_id') matches  ?
[01:26:33] <Cork> ($('#fb_id').length)
[01:26:47] <runtyrobot> facebook user ID.
[01:27:02] <Cork> that's not what i asked
[01:27:06] <Cork> does it find the element?
[01:28:18] <runtyrobot> it returns 1
[01:28:43] <Cork> and $('#fb_id').data() crashes?
[01:28:47] <runtyrobot> seems so
[01:29:09] <Cork> have you declared the variables and checked if that makes any difference?
[01:30:03] <miphe> Hi all, anyone knows if the tooltip plugin is incompatible with jQ 1.8.2?
[01:30:35] <miphe> http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-tooltip/
[01:35:22] <runtyrobot> Cork; seems that was the issue ,_,
[01:35:33] <runtyrobot> thanks! If you roll by the office, beers on me :P
[01:35:55] <Cork> runtyrobot: you should always be very careful to always define you're variables
[01:36:19] <runtyrobot> Completely missed that :[
[01:36:19] <Cork> cause if you don't they refer to the glocal scope (window.<your variable name>)
[01:36:24] <runtyrobot> thanks!
[01:36:53] <Cork> so it might be that ie has a special accessor there with the name of your varaible or something like that
[01:40:59] <retrostyle|15> hey ho
[01:41:15] <retrostyle|15> what is best practice for jquery mobile page navigation
[01:47:18] <slikts> is there some standard way to generate minified versions with something like uglifyjs while preserving/adding comments and such?
[01:47:49] <slikts> for instance, I notice plugins comments often start with /*!, is that a marker for some common tooling?
[01:48:53] <slikts> right now I'm running uglifyjs manually, but it's hard to believe plugin authors would normally manage minifying manually, since often the minified files even have different comments than source etc.
[01:50:13] <Cork> slikts: you mean like with --comments="all" ?
[01:51:14] <slikts> Cork: I use --comments="/somestring/" to only keep the top /* */ comment
[01:52:01] <Cork> "--comments         Preserve copyright comments in the output. ... You can optionally pass one of the following arguments to this flag: - "all" to keep all comments"
[01:52:45] <Cork> slikts: so the regex is what regulates what comments to keep
[01:53:38] <slikts> yep, that allows me to do things manually, but I'm wondering if there's some tooling to simplify more complex cases where, say, the comments would differ in source and minified versions
[01:53:39] <Qdest> Hi, I'm preventing default on document to prevent scrolling of the page in iOS etc. However, I have another event that triggers a fancybox on "tap". Can I somehow enableDefault (return true) or whatnot, so that scrolling is achievable in the fancybox?
[01:54:15] <slikts> I could write a shell script for that, but maybe there's something better
[01:54:22] <Cork> slikts: that one supports regex, you prob won't find anything more flexible that is "standard" then that
[01:54:26] <bnb_dev> exit
[01:54:30] <Qdest> Any suggestions? Really annoying when there is no way to scroll the content of the box.
[01:55:32] <Qdest> $(document).bind("touchmove",function(event){ event.preventDefault(); }); <-- that's what I'm using, and surely it works as intended. However I need to re-enable (stop prevention) when fancybox is present. Any idea how?
[01:56:32] <zeroquake> is it possible to click on a button on one html page -- and call javascript functions on another page
[01:57:11] <army> can i retrieve all elements that have an id which starts with '#xyz' ?
[01:57:49] <seutje> army: that should only be one element
[01:57:57] <army> which start with it
[01:58:02] <seutje> oh sry
[01:58:04] <army> e.g. id='xyz1'
[01:58:15] <seutje> $('[id^=xyz]' ?
[01:58:20] <seutje> $('[id^="xyz"]') ?
[01:58:24] <Cork> army: yes, but it will be quite slow
[01:58:57] <army> so either this one, or i have to take a <script>jQuery(document)...</script> element out of an ajax result and re-evaluate it
[01:59:06] <Cork> (as it will select every element on the page, and the loop over them looking for the attribute)
[01:59:14] <treeprogram> Hi, if I have an external .js file that contains my jquery code, can I pass an object argument (e.g. objvariable) to it, e.g.: $("#button_click").click(function(objvariable) { ...  ?
[01:59:21] <army> i can boil it down to a certain area
[01:59:22] <Cork> army: best option is to add a class to the elements
[01:59:42] <army> they do have the class='galleryview'
[01:59:51] <seutje> treeprogram: is that case, objvariable will always contain the event object that fired the click handler
[01:59:59] <Cork> army: so $('.glleryview')
[02:00:09] <army> lemme try! :)
[02:01:01] <treeprogram> seutje I see thanks. Is there any way I can specify another object?  The object is created in the main file called 'default.html', and the jquery code is in 'external.js'
[02:02:11] <seutje> treeprogram: either expose it in the global scope (preferably namespaced), or I think there's a clever way of executing a file in a certian context, but not sure how exactly and what the x-browser support looks like
[02:02:48] <treeprogram> seutje any pointers on how I can expose it in the global scope? I'm a total newbie in jquery and not that experienced in JS
[02:03:28] <seutje> window.myApp.myObj = objvariable;
[02:03:47] <seutje> then anything on the page can access window.myApp.myObj
[02:05:10] <treeprogram> seutje thank you very much, that's very helpful
[02:05:52] <seutje> treeprogram: alternatively, your other script could expose a init function or constructor you can pass said object to
[02:06:29] <seutje> then it could store its own internal reference
[02:07:26] <bnb_dev> How jQuery work on $.get(args) and $(element).get(args)?
[02:07:49] <treeprogram> ok, I'm going to try the first method, see if I can get it to work
[02:08:21] <Cork> bnb_dev: on of the is $.fn.get the other is $.get

[02:12:26] <knes> hi, I have a question.  I have a td tags with an pid attribute. In this attribute I have a string of comma separated numbers like 238, 42, 56, 65, 38. How can I use jquery to select only the TDs with the numer in it?
[02:13:05] <knes> $("#ptable tbody td[lineup*='"+pid+"'']") this is what I am doing right now
[02:13:20] <knes> but if the pid is 38, It will also select the TD who have 238 in it of course
[02:13:22] <knes> :'(

[02:23:39] <varnie> hello
[02:24:24] <varnie> are there any good "textlimit" plugin for textareas in jquery which counts carriage returns as well and work well for IE?
[02:50:15] <knes> can anyway help me answer this question on Stackoverflow?
[02:50:16] <knes> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13267718/select-a-table-row-base-on-the-content-of-a-custom-attribute
[02:54:30] <faraway> knes: either you do it with space delimiter and ~=  or you could sore it this way lineup=",63,463," and look for *=',63,'  or you write your own selector extension
[03:04:17] <andolf_> hello, i'm still having some trouble
[03:05:04] <andolf_> basically i have a form that slides up when you press next and puts you onto the next form
[03:05:14] <andolf_> however, when i press next the form completely disappears
[03:05:37] <andolf_> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/62601513/ss/slide1.png
[03:05:40] <andolf_> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/62601513/ss/slide2.png
[03:05:45] <xec_> knes: if you swap the " with ' and vice versa, you can use JSON.parse() to turn the string into an array
[03:06:15] <andolf_> i also have a different version of it, but it works perfectly fine..which I can provide on JSfiddle
[03:06:17] <xec_> knes: then you can use Array.indexOf() to check if the number exists in it
[03:07:32] <xec_> knes: *or* you can do the ugly $('[lineup*="\'63\'"]')
[03:07:45] <xec_> (include the quotes in the attribute contains selector)
[03:07:58] <seutje> knes: check my answer, that what you needed?
[03:08:20] <seutje> xec_: yeah, basically what I posted
[03:08:42] <xec_> yes, that's exactly what i meant, +1 to you ;D
[03:11:23] <Trisox> hey seutje
[03:11:29] <seutje> hey
[03:11:54] <Trisox> hows life
[03:16:03] <xec_> knes: also, it's not easy to tell if you could do this in a better way without knowing the bigger picture of what you're trying to achieve
[03:18:15] <andolf_> anyone?!
[03:19:02] <xec_> andolf_: can't really debug a picture. or a working fiddle.
[03:19:14] <xec_> ?demo
[03:19:14] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:20:42] <andolf_> http://rewardedopinions.co.uk/signup
[03:23:22] <xec_> andolf_: you have display: none !important; in the css
[03:24:13] <xec_> any (good) reason for that?
[03:26:28] <xec_> andolf_: visibility: hidden; isn't helping you either
[03:27:03] <adam007> hello how to show datepicker and fancybox in one page?
[03:33:15] <EnginA> maybe it can be considered as a design flow that jq does not store all the state in the DOM for, for instance, drag-drop support.
[03:33:45] <xec_> did you mean "design flaw"?
[03:33:53] <EnginA> yes :)
[03:34:11] <andolf_> xec_: I didn't someone else coded/designed this,  i've just been given it as a project to fix
[03:34:33] <xec_> andolf_: so you thought you'd give it to us to fix, i get it :)
[03:35:01] <andolf_> xec, haha, not really.. i'm not really schooled on jquery that much..
[03:35:15] <andolf_> my other version works fine, one i have on jsfiddle
[03:35:25] <xec_> well, did you understand what i just told you about the css?
[03:35:43] <andolf_> yep, going to try it now
[03:36:47] <xec_> EnginA: i'm not sure what you mean about storing state - do you mean between page refreshes?
[03:38:30] <EnginA> xec_: well, for my --admittedly-- unusual case, I want to save and restore a user designed (by drag-dropping components) docuemnt
[03:39:20] <EnginA> even thoguh all the clases are intact, drag-droppability is does not work until it is reinitialized
[03:39:57] <EnginA> to overcome this i'm doin 1) while storing data, removing all the bullshit 2) while restoring data an initializer is called for each element depending on its data-widget-type
[03:40:10] <EnginA> wisget as in a ui component, not jqui widget

[04:31:41] <airshock> Hello all. Wondering if someone can really quickly take a look at my jQuery code for me, I think I've coded it correctly but nothing works as it should (e.g. when form submits). jQuery is at http://pastesite.com/83402 and associated HTML is here: http://pastesite.com/83404 (references jQuery called dialogs.js)
[04:31:55] <airshock> Any guidance or assistance provided would be greatly appreciated. :)
[04:32:22] <airshock> Oh, and temporary demo of everything is at http://audioshout.com/index2.php

[05:00:08] <ezhilvanan> best md5 online cracker?
[05:04:19] <grafi> oO
[05:12:40] <ezhilvanan> anyone can Decrypt this MD5 37c9d7c9bce06e7ab75544a47b285807  ?
[05:15:49] <Haprog> ezhilvanan: MD5 is not an encryption method, so in that sense, you can not "decrypt" it.
[05:16:06] <Haprog> it's a one way hashing algorithm
[05:16:34] <joflow> Hello all. I'm having a conflict between this OAuth library - https://github.com/andreassolberg/jso/blob/master/jso.js and JQuery UI. Once I load Jquery UI I can't run the $.oajax function declared in the other library. jquery_noconflict() might not be the best option here ? Anyone ?
[05:20:18] <ezhilvanan> Haprog: then how to get the string from MD5?
[05:21:42] <joflow> ezhilvanan: you cant. take a string, get an md5 hash of it and compare it to what you have
[05:21:54] <Haprog> ezhilvanan: there is no way to definitely know what is the original string since multiple strings may result in the same MD5 hash. if you only need any one string that produces the MD5 you have, you can always try to guess it by brute force or search it in pregenerated rainbow tables that may be awailable online.
[05:22:19] <Haprog> *available
[05:37:38] <ezhilvanan> thank you joflow, Haprog
[05:38:49] <juha_> ezhilvanan: the string is: goatse
[05:40:37] <ezhilvanan> juha: thats not a correct str
[05:40:56] <juha_> no, i think you are wrong, it is
[05:41:02] <juha_> i can see it from the pixels
[05:41:28] <ezhilvanan> okay wait a moment
[05:43:04] <ezhilvanan> this is the md5 what i need to decrypt:  37c9d7c9bce06e7ab75544a47b285807
[05:43:23] <ezhilvanan> are you sure about "goatse"?
[05:43:49] <xec_> no, he's not sure. he's trolling.
[05:44:08] <xec_> read the other replies - they may not be what you want to hear, but they are what you need to hear
[05:44:17] <zsoc> I have a page with a huge amount of cpu usage, like 25%. Basically it has a bunch of countdowns on it. (like.. 10?). They make ajax calls and then are updated with innerHTML. I traced it down to jquery lib where innerHTML is defined. What am i doing wrong that running innerHTML ~10 times per second is destroying the page so much i can't even hardly scroll up or down (on a fast processor...)
[05:45:09] <blackspotwiggins> ezhilvanan, try oclhashcat
[05:45:23] <blackspotwiggins> or there are services that do it for a small amount of money on tons of ec2 instances
[05:47:35] <ezhilvanan> thanks xec.. I'll ask my Client to get the password
[05:47:57] <ezhilvanan> no blackspot.. its not working
[05:48:32] <xec_> ezhilvanan: "oclhashcat" is a service, not the "decrypted" string.
[05:50:26] <blackspotwiggins> hacking a md5 is a rather questionably practice anyway
[05:55:51] <Haprog> blackspotwiggins: depends what the md5 hash represents. it might be the hash of a large binary file for all we know
[05:56:05] <blackspotwiggins> might be
[05:56:37] <Haprog> passwords shouldn't be stored in "plain" md5 either. not without a unique salt atleast.
[05:56:43] <Haprog> many legacy systems do that though.
[05:57:32] <blackspotwiggins> yea, we all should use bcrypt
[05:57:39] <blackspotwiggins> or scrypt if we are paranoid
[05:57:54] <blackspotwiggins> but i bet there are millions of systems with unsalted md5's
[06:16:59] <AMIGrAve> since jquery ui 1.9, how do I manually activate a menu item of an autocomplete ? I used to do menu.activate() but it not longer exists. I tried menu#focus but it's not the same as 'activate'

[06:41:29] <jugglinmike> dmcdaniel12: IE9 supports JSON natively
[06:41:32] <jugglinmike> no library required
[06:43:48] <dmcdaniel12> jugglinmike - I thought so. I'm getting an error ONLY in IE9 though. SCRIPT5009: 'myData' is undefined. This is defined in my AJAX call.
[06:44:03] <dmcdaniel12> works in ff and chrome, just can't get it to work in ie9
[06:44:48] <jugglinmike> that sounds like a dereferencing error, not a parsing error
[06:45:26] <jugglinmike> is "myData" a local variable?
[06:45:58] <dmcdaniel12> yes.
[06:47:09] <jugglinmike> in that case, you'll want to investigate the code you expect to set "myData"'s value
[06:48:02] <dmcdaniel12> will do.
[06:48:41] <dmcdaniel12> looks like it isn't even running my rest call.
[06:50:51] <dmcdaniel12> $.ajax(request); is never run inside the code. added console.log around it and inside it and the around run, inside doesn't. Will work on that. Thanks
[06:59:36] <adavia> hi.. did anyone here used the jquery file tree pluggin?
[07:03:59] <adavia> ?
[07:07:25] <hcker2000> hello all
[07:12:52] <userl> ;?x

[07:14:13] <userl>  NS1.BHNTAMPA.COM    NS2.BHNTAMPA.COM
[07:18:51] <zsoc> So I'm having a huge laaaaggg issue with line "curCSS = function( elem, name )" in jquery 1.8.2
[07:19:00] <zsoc> is this 'getting' the CSS of an element?
[07:26:04] <bmoyles0117> Hey there, does anyone know how to prevent the functionality of an element's click handler, through an action in another click handler for the same element?
[07:26:31] <bmoyles0117> In other words, if I bind FUNCTION 1, can I bind FUNCTION 2, that cancels the affects of FUNCTION 1?
[07:28:03] <krz> whats the equivalent of turning "Fri, 19 Oct 2012 10:48:05 UTC +00:00" to "2012-10-19T10:48:05Z". in rails, this would be .getutc.iso8601
[07:28:56] <faraway> zsoc: this line is for getting the computed style of the element
[07:31:08] <faraway> bmoyles0117: the event handlers a calle din the order they where bind to the element .. in the handler you can use http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/ so that no further handler will be called for the current action.
[07:31:18] <zsoc> it's taking up obsene amount of cpu time. how in the world is that even possible.
[07:31:47] <adavia> hi.. did anyone here used the jquery file tree pluggin?
[07:31:49] <faraway> zsoc: are you setting or getting a css when this function is called ?
[07:32:26] <bmoyles0117> faraway: So there's no way to step backwards, or re-prioritize the ordering of events that have been bound?
[07:32:39] <faraway> bmoyles0117: so you need to register the handlers in the correct order to achive what you want to do.
[07:33:09] <zsoc> faraway, there's a countdown timer (a few actually) so it makes changes with .innerHTML a bunch. But even if it did it 3 times a second it shouldn't bring my quad core cpu to a halt
[07:33:18] <bmoyles0117> faraway: would you recommend doing like a 50 millisecond timeout on the first bind, if the physical ordering itself can not be swapped?
[07:37:01] <zsoc> faraway, the innerHTML adds a div with a class setting... would that be triggering curCSS?
[07:38:53] <zsoc> ha, ok, found the problem
[07:39:10] <faraway> bmoyles0117: currently it would also work with a timeout of 0 milliseconds, but i would not recommand it. because it could be harder to debug if it does not work later .. you probably should think over the logic of your code
[07:39:56] <bmoyles0117> faraway: I just reorganized it a bit, stopImmediatePropagation hit what I needed square on the head, thank you so much!
[07:40:35] <faraway> bmoyles0117: np

[07:47:11] <firstclassfunc> I'm looping over an object and loading javscript files with $.ajax. In my complete function I print "Loading " + file, however it only prints the last script (because at the time of completion, the loop is already at the last script). How do I fix this?
[07:49:25] <jrajav> You're running into a closure issue
[07:49:36] <jrajav> It would be a lot easier to help if you could show some example code
[07:49:45] <Spuddyz> If I have a table with rows containing dates (YYYY-MM-DD) and some of them are 0000-00-00, how could I find the last column in the row with an actual date to apply specific css to it?
[07:49:59] <RLa> are there any examples of jquery-mobile where buttons do something else than just switching pages?
[07:50:40] <firstclassfunc> jrajav: here you go, http://pastebin.com/QGEBsYKb
[07:50:58] <firstclassfunc> I've also tried with .done(function(){...}) to no avail
[07:52:04] <RLa> i can't belive such essential part of documentation is left out
[07:53:31] <shoky> firstclassfunc: put a function around your loop body, or use $.each
[07:53:58] <jrajav> firstclassfunc: Your problem is that you're referencing a variable outside the function - which creates a closure around that variable. Meaning, when the function is run, it will reference the value of that variable at the time of running, not the value at the time the function was defined
[07:54:29] <firstclassfunc> shoky, jrajav: ah ok, makes sense. thanks
[07:54:47] <jrajav> Instead of function() { var currentUrl = url; }, you need to do something like (function () { var currentUrl = url; return function () { // do stuff with currentUrl } })();
[07:54:53] <firstclassfunc> I remember doing something very similar with $.each yesterday and having no problems
[07:54:56] <jrajav> Then you will "capture" the current value of url
[07:55:08] <firstclassfunc> I see
[07:55:33] <firstclassfunc> is there a good doc that handles this?
[07:55:58] <jrajav> http://jibbering.com/faq/notes/closures/
[07:56:23] <faraway> Spuddyz: i think $("td:contains('0000-00-00')").closest("tr").find("td:last").css(....)   should work ... but i have not time to check right now
[07:56:38] <firstclassfunc> thanks
[07:57:02] <jrajav> Hmm, I can't find anything more accessible that I have bookmarked, sorry
[07:57:02] <shoky> firstclassfunc: the main point is that, that 'var url' you have is misleading, because it makes it look like that var's local scope is the inner body of the loop
[07:57:26] <jrajav> firstclassfunc: Try googling "javascript closures" or look for the functional programming section in Eloquent Javascript
[07:58:04] <shoky> firstclassfunc: but in JS, var's are scoped to their containing function, so what's really going on is:  function loadRest() { var url; for (var file..) { ... url = ...; $.get.. }
[07:58:28] <faraway> Spuddyz: http://jsfiddle.net/s8ZmV/
[08:00:07] <jrajav> Oh yeah
[08:00:10] <jrajav> Good catch by shoky
[08:00:14] <firstclassfunc> shoky: that makes sense
[08:00:17] <jrajav> I think I completely misunderstood the problem :P
[08:00:24] <jrajav> But both problems might be there
[08:02:56] <codecowboy> hi should this work $(document).on("load", function(event){console.log('load event fired')});?
[08:05:11] <faraway> codecowboy: i thought it should be $(window) ... why do you need to listen to load ?
[08:06:08] <codecowboy> faraway, yep window works. just trying to debug something. i have an event which seems to be firing when the user resizes the window but there is no code which tells it to do that
[08:06:53] <codecowboy> faraway, what i want to do is trigger a custom event in one method and listen for it in another method. whats the best way to do that?
[08:08:28] <faraway> codecowboy:for dom event you can alway do $(".some-element").trigger("the-event-name")  e.g. $(".some-element").trigger("click"); and all handler that listen to this event on that element will be called
[08:12:40] <converge> when Im doing an ajax call, it's having an weird behavior, its returning 302 and 200 for my actual page. can someone help me ? http://cl.ly/image/2A3q0I2C233u
[08:13:28] <Pilate> help what? thats what its supposed to do
[08:14:12] <converge> Pilate: Im doing a very similar call and it's making just one call
[08:15:17] <Pilate> your form is redirecting, its not a javascript issue
[08:16:01] <converge> Pilate: I really cant see whats wrong, can you take a quick look on my code ?
[08:16:11] <faraway> converge: well 302 status tells the browsers that the url that it is requesting is temporary aviable at another address, so the browser is requesting that one
[08:17:55] <faraway> converge: it is often used to prevent the "do you want to resend the post data" question if data is send with a POST request to the server and the user reloads the document
[08:19:16] <Pilate> and no amount of looking at your javascript will help :D
[08:19:25] <converge> faraway: got it. but I really cant understand why this ajax call is trying to reload my actual page, i'll show you the url and the calls
[08:19:50] <faraway> converge: it does not reload your page
[08:20:08] <adavia> why im not able to load  file:///C:/wamp/www/aggreko/assets/files/Archivos%20Generales/Andres.doc  through my application?
[08:20:47] <converge> faraway, Pilate: What Im trying to understand is that Im doing almost exactly same thing in another ajax call, inside the same page, and it's working fine.
[08:20:56] <faraway> converge: ajax is sending a POST to server ... server tells the browser that the urls has changed and returns the new url ... to then the browser request this url and passes this result to the ajax request
[08:20:58] <adavia> if i copy the path in the browser it works
[08:21:19] <Pilate> exactly, its whatever the server is doing thats redirecting, your code is irrelevant
[08:22:32] <converge> faraway: got it, but why the "same" ajax call would return the data in 2 different ways?
[08:22:54] <Pilate> then theyre not the same
[08:23:02] <Pilate> easy explanation
[08:23:29] <converge> it's not the same, but its very similar, there isnt big changes
[08:23:33] <converge> between each other
[08:25:30] <converge> Pilate, faraway: I would appreciate if you could take a look on my code http://paste2.org/p/2442007
[08:26:26] <faraway> converge: as Pilate said they are differnt ... the urls differ
[08:26:28] <Pilate> the code is completely irrelevant
[08:26:34] <Pilate> for the 10th time
[08:27:07] <faraway> converge: and the reason is not jquery but the server ... so you need to ask the one who wrote the code on the server why the redirect is done
[08:28:08] <converge> faraway: the url's are diff. but the function does almost the same. one make on ajax call and the other one makes two calls, one that doesnt do the work and the other one that it's just loading without return
[08:29:02] <converge> that's driving me nuts, I wanna find what's wrong
[08:30:15] <Pilate> perhaps you need #php then
[08:30:25] <frantz> Has anyone had issues with browsers rendering google web fonts?
[08:30:46] <faraway> Pilate: i need calmatives ^^
[08:34:05] <converge> Pilate, faraway: thank you guys, just found what was wrong
[08:40:35] <Marnix_I_> Need some help, if I send a array along as data in .load() http://api.jquery.com/load/ called 'sentArray[]', can I then retrieve this data with $_POST['sentArray[]']; in my PHP and put it in a PHP array?
[08:42:08] <firstclassfunc> can anyone recommend a way to load scripts and determine when ALL scripts have completed in a "jquery" way?
[08:42:50] <firstclassfunc> I use a way with setTimeout but it might be ugly
[08:44:24] <kaine> Is there a event which gets called when a div changes the position?
[08:56:22] <koopajah> Hello everyone. I have a question about jQuery's datepicker. Since using onSelect/onClose events instead of just onClose, my datapicker won't go into onClose when I press return key, only if I click on a date. Does someone know what I'm doing wrong ?
[09:09:00] <faraway> kaine: no
[09:10:37] <adamo> anyone bored?
[09:10:51] <adamo> can someone review a piece of JS code for me?
[09:11:00] <adamo> im new to object oriented js
[09:11:05] <adamo> a very small piece of code
[09:11:14] <adamo> http://jsfiddle.net/eGeRJ/1/
[09:19:23] <avinashrbhat> adamo, this is not the way to create a 'class' in javascript. public method should be stored in the prototype chain.
[09:19:29] <HarryPitfall> how i can find elements that have a attribute named "data-mask" ?
[09:19:39] <HarryPitfall> is just [data-mask] ?
[09:20:22] <systemfault> Yep
[09:25:53] <fission6> i am catching the space bar event, i did     $(document).keydown(function(event) { how can i not include form fields like text area
[09:34:53] <fission6> hmm
[09:38:29] <BillCriswell> fission6: You should be able to just see what element triggered the event and if it's an input you should be like "No, don't do that".
[09:41:40] <Alfie> Hello everyone!
[09:42:08] <fission6> BillCriswell: is that in the event object?
[09:43:15] <BillCriswell> fission6: Yeah... think it's e.target?
[09:43:26] <BillCriswell> fission6: You could also look into ".on()"
[09:43:30] <Alfie> I have the following function: http://scrp.at/bUI at line 32 I manage the selects, there is a particular case I have, where I have multiple selects with the same name.
[09:45:05] <Alfie> I'm trying to make an array with the selects' values as keys and the inputs (right in the same parent element) as values. I've been banging my head in the wall for 2 days, no luck., anyone up to help?
[09:48:59] <fission6> BillCriswell: yea this seemed to work, i could only seem to include keydown on the (document)
[09:49:05] <fission6> if (event.which == 32 && event.target.type != 'textarea')
[09:49:41] <webdev> laters all
[09:50:03] <koopajah> Can someone help me with jQuery's datepicker and events onSelect/onChange please?
[09:50:03] <KWhat_Work> How does the widget factory set element data?  Is that documented somewhere?
[09:53:29] <KWhat_Work> koopajah: as the question
[09:54:55] <koopajah> KWhat_Work : http://jsfiddle.net/WETh2/7/   when you select a date with the keyboard, if you don't change the previous date, only onSelect is called, if you change it you have "onSelect", "onClose", "onSelect"
[09:55:02] <koopajah> I can't understand what's happenin
[09:55:03] <koopajah> g
[09:57:27] <KWhat_Work> koopajah: I dont get a close event at all with the keyboard
[09:57:34] <KWhat_Work> this appears to function correctly
[09:57:48] <vacho> how can I check with jquery if an element if a certain id exists?? is find the best way?
[09:58:24] <koopajah> KWhat_Work : first use ctrl+left arrow key, this will change the default date, then return key => you will have onSelect/onClose/onSelect
[09:58:24] <GeO2> I check is size()>0
[09:58:32] <GeO2> not sure if it's a good habit tho
[09:58:40] <vacho> GeO2:  ?
[09:58:46] <vacho> talking to me?
[09:59:02] <GeO2> like if ($("my_element").size()>0) { ...it exists...}
[09:59:03] <GeO2> yes
[09:59:27] <GeO2> I meant $("#my_element"), if you're working with IDs
[09:59:59] <koopajah> KWhat_Work > i don't understand why clicking on a date leads to onSelect then onClose and using return key does not close it ?
[10:00:03] <vacho> $("#my_element").size() > 0  cool
[10:00:52] <KWhat_Work> I assume it was a design decision
[10:01:10] <TelFiRE> So I have an element which I need to fade out and then fade another element in. Normally I would make both position absolute and put them on top of each other so as to avoid the bottom one fading in below and then jumping up once the other one was gone. But if these elements end up being position:absolute my scrollbar won't work. Is there a way to animate these and have them be on top of eachother without position absolute? Or a method for handling this? Ma
[10:01:10] <TelFiRE> just position:absolute during the animation and then change it back after but I'm not too sure
[10:02:23] <koopajah> KWhat_Work > ok. Do you know if there's a way to close the datepicker when using keyboard ? like when i'm in the onSelect or in the handler to the Enter Key, what can I use to properly close the datepicker
[10:03:42] <KWhat_Work> koopajah: try calling the hide function
[10:08:06] <KWhat_Work> koopajah: http://jsfiddle.net/WETh2/9/
[10:09:03] <Wolf_22> Is it possible to put the contents / result of load() into a variable for further processing?
[10:09:49] <KWhat_Work> anyone know wtf a BC Layer is ?
[10:11:04] <koopajah> KWhat_Work > thanks, it seems to work but it does not relly destroy the datepicker, it just hides it
[10:11:36] <KWhat_Work> koopajah: call destroy instead of hide to totally kill it
[10:12:45] <koopajah> KWhat_Work > yeah but destroy does not work in my "real" case, no idea why it works on this jsfiddle
[10:13:09] <koopajah> thanks anyway, i'll try to make it work, i was hoping i did something wrong and that it was not the "expected behaviour" ^^
[10:14:06] <KWhat_Work> if it makes you feel better the datepicker widget is kind of a heap of shit but no one really wanted to hear that last time i filed a bug with it
[10:19:12] <koopajah> KWhat_Work > it makes me feel a lot better, spent whole day on this ^^
[10:19:41] <Zamarok> how come $("object").load doesn't work when object has type="inline/svg+xml" ?
[10:20:42] <ucefkh> hi
[10:21:27] <Zamarok> $("object")[0].addEventListener works fine, but $("object").load(function() { }); doesn't ever call the callback
[10:25:55] <HarryPitfall> is 'load' the event name?
[10:26:11] <HarryPitfall> did you tryed .bind('load', ...) instead?
[10:26:28] <Zamarok> HarryPitfall: Yes, and addEventListener("load", myCallBack); works fine
[10:26:42] <Zamarok> HarryPitfall: And bind("load", myCallBack); doesn't work either :(
[10:27:05] <Zamarok> $("object").bind, that is.. yeah no luck there :(
[10:27:22] <HarryPitfall> so, is some hidden bug on jquery
[10:28:41] <Zamarok> I think so too. .load() doesn't work at all on object tags that are used for SVG :(
[10:30:55] <vacho> going nutse..
[10:30:59] <vacho> how do I regex for a date??
[10:31:25] <vacho> YYYY-MM-DD
[10:31:53] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/XzmgVZst
[10:33:19] <gnarf> Zamarok: a lot of jQuery things break with SVG - it's kinda one of the generic "wont fix" issues in the library
[10:33:51] <gnarf> I'm not sure specifically of the load issue you speak of, but I know other things are broken with SVG as well
[10:34:12] <ucefkh> gujb
[10:34:24] <Zamarok> gnarf: okay :( thanks
[10:34:41] <ucefkh> hi
[10:35:03] <gnarf> Zamarok: usually - it's a matter of fixing the bug causes too much code - you might want to look on bugs.jquery.com to see if this issue is already reported
[10:35:32] <gnarf> and if it isn't you might want to report it - there is a chance that it is an easy fix
[10:36:03] <Zamarok> gnarf: Okay, I'll check.. I can fix it myself on modern browsers, but IE compatibility will be a bitch I think
[10:36:14] <wrapids> I'm getting a "Origin null is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin." error even when specifying that the url is http:// ($.ajax)
[10:37:25] <gnarf> wrapids: same host/port/proto? see ?sop
[10:37:26] <bot-t> wrapids, Same origin policy prevents a document or script loaded from one origin from getting or setting properties of a document from another origin.

[10:38:57] <someprimetime> to all my hustlas… http://jsfiddle.net/RrmNm/18/ i'd like to make it so when if you've already voted up (or down) and you vote down (or up) it'll change the vote from up to down… basically right now you have to click twice on each button element to reset the vote to the original and then click for your new vote
[10:40:12] <luckysmack> i jave a jquery ui dialog. in the .dialog() portion i have a close: section to define what happens when the dialog closes. when it does, I want to reload the parent page. Currently if I simply close the window, it reloads the page. but if I submit the form inside the dialog, it closes without reloading. I want the opposite effect. if I simply close the dialog, nothing happens, but if the form was submitted, then reload the parent 
[10:40:35] <luckysmack> but I cant seem to get it to work. I was hoping someone could help me out.
[10:41:53] <wrapids> Thanks a bunch, gnarf.
[10:42:20] <luckysmack> this is what I have so far: http://pastie.org/5341822
[10:43:42] <wachpwnski> Does anyone have an example for a drop down notifications bar?
[10:44:06] <wachpwnski> I just want a big box to drop down over the page.
[10:44:24] <someprimetime> lol
[10:44:31] <someprimetime> kinda vague
[10:45:07] <someprimetime> you could show and hide a div that's positioned in the center of the window absolutely
[10:45:15] <someprimetime> that'd be one at the most basic level
[10:45:57] <EHLOVader> anyone know of any implementation of an annotated scrollbar with the slickgrid jquery UI  plugin?
[10:46:10] <wachpwnski> I think have an idea.
[10:46:26] <pankaj> how many days is required to learn basic jquery+ajax?
[10:46:33] <wachpwnski> you can use slidedown and stuff.
[10:47:05] <wachpwnski> pankaj:  depends. I would say a decent programmer can learn it in less than a day.
[10:47:13] <wachpwnski> Mastering it is another thing.
[10:47:28] <someprimetime> pankaj: 10 days and you'll be a pro
[10:48:00] <dblosevn_> one year and youll be writing jquery while you sleep :-)
[10:48:07] <pankaj> thankx
[10:48:09] <wachpwnski> haha pretty much
[10:48:39] <dblosevn_> i just trained my dog how to qrite jquery so I actually can sleep now
[10:49:03] <wachpwnski> I read a book didn't understand it very well. Was coding with it, for a day, then revisited the book, and it all made sense.
[10:49:16] <dblosevn_> i hate books
[10:49:19] <pankaj> how i learn j-query? any resource for j-query books?
[10:49:20] <vacho> can someone help me write a date regex
[10:49:34] <wachpwnski> I taught my dog to read books, his name is Kindle.
[10:49:40] <dblosevn_> let me see what your trying to match vacho
[10:49:43] <luckysmack> how can I detect wheter a jqui dialog was closed when the form inside was submitted, rather than normal closing such as pressing the close button? i cant seem to find a way. as the dialog just seems to go away.
[10:50:03] <wachpwnski> vacho:  google it? You can find good examples. You can also ask on regex.
[10:50:44] <dblosevn_> or he could have told me the string hes trying to match lol
[10:50:56] <wachpwnski> luckysmack: are you using the close: function() {...}
[10:51:14] <luckysmack> yes
[10:51:26] <luckysmack> but that code only gets run when I close the dialog myself
[10:51:38] <luckysmack> http://pastie.org/5341822
[10:51:38] <wachpwnski> When would it close itself?
[10:51:52] <dblosevn_> im wondering the ssame thing lol
[10:51:54] <wachpwnski> jsfiddle...
[10:52:02] <luckysmack> in the dialog i load a form. when I hit submit, the dialog closes after the form is submitted.
[10:52:06] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/pdAn4wTb
[10:52:33] <vacho> dblosevn_: appreciate the help, going nutse.
[10:52:44] <wachpwnski> vacho:  there are a ton of date regexs because there are a ton of date formats.
[10:52:51] <dblosevn_> luckysmack: attach a submit listner on the form
[10:52:55] <vacho> I want this format YYYY-MM-DD
[10:53:29] <dblosevn_> \d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2} vacho
[10:54:01] <luckysmack> link on how to do that? im looking at the api page
[10:54:01] <BillCriswell> vacho: Don't forget the /^ at the start and $/ at the end.
[10:54:02] <vacho> dblosevn_: will that work with my code?
[10:54:03] <wachpwnski> dblosevn_:  you are why space ships crash
[10:54:16] <devone> hi all, how would i go about doing something like this in jq? $('#blah').(function() { console.log(this); }();)
[10:54:19] <vacho> BillCriswell: thanks..
[10:54:26] <wachpwnski> 9932-32-99 is a valid date then....
[10:54:44] <dblosevn_> BillCriswell: i assumed he would know to add the delimiters
[10:55:07] <madprops> hi, anybody knows how to get the direction of a touchmove event?
[10:55:14] <devone> wachpwnski Year 2038 problem :D
[10:55:43] <wachpwnski> My concern is more so the month and days that don't exist
[10:55:50] <BillCriswell> dblosevn_: Yeah, but if you need help for  regex like that I'd think someone was fairly new to them
[10:56:03] <vacho> someone
[10:56:03] <vacho> please.
[10:56:41] <vacho> if ( !$("#form-due-date").val().match("/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/") ) doies not work
[10:56:41] <devone> so, is it possible to attach an anonymous function to a selector in jquery? a la $('#blah').(function(){}();)
[10:57:20] <wachpwnski> vacho: this is more accurate: /^[0-9]{4}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|3[0-1])$/
[10:57:44] <vacho> wachpwnski: I am afraid i might have code problems..can u check this for me?
[10:57:59] <BillCriswell> 0000 :-p
[10:58:04] <vacho> if ( !$("#form-due-date").val().match("/^[0-9]{4}-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[1-2][0-9]|3[0-1])$/") ) { alert("date is in invalid format"); }
[10:58:16] <BillCriswell> vacho: You don't need the ".
[10:58:40] <vacho> around the regex ?? ok
[10:59:00] <wachpwnski> yes
[10:59:09] <wachpwnski> just match(/^$/)
[10:59:33] <vacho> thiank u that finally worked!
[11:02:45] <dblosevn_> in that case /^[0-2][0-9]{3}-[0-1][0-9]-[0-3][0-9]$/ would also work, I was just worried about the format being right not neccessarily validating the date was actually valid as well, I usually save that for the server side code.
[11:03:26] <dblosevn_> I rarely rely on clientside code for validation
[11:03:39] <wachpwnski> dblosevn_:  I wasn't meaning to beat you up, just being a pompous douche. Hah
[11:04:07] <dblosevn_> wachpwnski: I didnt want the spaceships to crash :-D
[11:04:33] <wachpwnski> Can't have that. Then how will we get our cheese from the moon?
[11:06:28] <dblosevn_> meals on wheels?

[11:14:31] <dblosevn> yummy
[11:16:39] <Wolf_22> I have some elements I've inserted into my markup via load() and I'm wanting to apply element.attr to give them IDs. Whenever I try, though, it doesn't work. Can this not be done to elements which have been load()ed?
[11:19:00] <dblosevn> Wolf_22: try $('selector').prop('id', 'newid') instead
[11:20:00] <dblosevn> or if you already have a refrence to the actual dom object not a jq object you can do element.id = 'newid';
[11:22:31] <Wolf_22> Looks like the prop idea isn't doing it either but here's how I've used it (maybe I'm using it wrong?): $('form input[type="submit"]').prop("id", "submit");
[11:23:19] <NoiseEee> what makes you think its not working Wolf_22?
[11:23:49] <NoiseEee> var btn = $('form input[type="submit"]');  btn.prop('id','submit');  console.log(btn.prop('id'));
[11:24:31] <Wolf_22> NoiseEee: I can't see the CSS I'm trying to apply and when I view the stack in Firefox, I can't see any indication that the ID was / is being applied to the element.
[11:24:49] <someprimetime>  http://jsfiddle.net/RrmNm/18/ i'd like to make it so when if you've already voted up (or down) and you vote down (or up) it'll change the vote from up to down… basically right now you have to click twice on each button element to reset the vote to the original and then
[11:25:03] <NoiseEee> well run that script in console, what does it give you Wolf_22?  perhaps your CSS is mis-targeted?
[11:25:25] <NoiseEee> Wolf_22: also, i presume there's a single form and a single submit button on that page?
[11:25:36] <Wolf_22> NoiseEee: It could be. I'll try it and see what it gets me. (Yes about the form and button.)
[11:26:17] <Wolf_22> NoiseEee: Console displayed "undefined".
[11:26:57] <NoiseEee> Wolf_22: and console.log(btn) ?
[11:26:58] <dblosevn> code looks right though
[11:27:44] <dblosevn> are you trying to add the id before injecting into the dom maybe?
[11:28:03] <Wolf_22> console.log(btn) has stuff in it.
[11:28:14] <NoiseEee> Wolf_22: jquery version?
[11:28:18] <Wolf_22> 1.8
[11:28:29] <Wolf_22> 1.8.2... Sorry.
[11:30:48] <NoiseEee> Wolf_22: http://jsfiddle.net/Aywjw/
[11:30:57] <NoiseEee> Wolf_22: maybe make a fiddle yourself and you'll find the problem?
[11:31:21] <Wolf_22> NoiseEee: Thanks. I'll check that out.
[11:31:28] <dblosevn> Wolf_22: http://jsfiddle.net/bhqv4/
[11:31:53] <Wolf_22> dblosevn: Thanks.
[11:33:48] <dblosevn> wow when did js fiddle start doing that... in firefox it opened firebug in the result pane
[11:34:28] <NoiseEee> dblosevn: if you choose 'edge', you get a box that lets you display firebug lite
[11:34:38] <Wolf_22> I noticed that too.
[11:35:02] <dblosevn> ah
[11:36:06] <dblosevn> hows that work if i aready have firebug... will lite interface with the firebug plugin or does it burn twice the resources?
[11:36:40] <jeffsmykil> What has the lowest entry point knowledge wise to write a webservice that sends high scores to a MySQL database?
[11:36:52] <jeffsmykil> Language wise, Python? PHP?
[11:37:16] <dblosevn> php has a extremely low learning curve
[11:37:21] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: any backend language that lets you interface with a database... and some SQL knowledge
[11:37:36] <jeffsmykil> i have basic sql knowledge from using sql manager
[11:37:44] <jeffsmykil> NoiseEee can it be done with just ruby?
[11:37:56] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: i'd imagine so
[11:38:04] <jeffsmykil> What would you recomend?
[11:38:07] <dblosevn> ya ruby would work
[11:38:25] <NoiseEee> jeffsmykil: id recommend whatever you're comfortable with
[11:38:41] <dblosevn> i personally prefer php but thats just me lol if you know ruby id go with what you know
[11:39:15] <vinici> for webservices? use java :)
[11:39:22] <dblosevn> eeeeeeww
[11:39:23] <san> hello people
[11:39:26] <vinici> but i'm suspicious because i work with java :D
[11:39:39] <dblosevn> i hate jsp lol
[11:39:45] <vinici> hehe
[11:39:58] <dblosevn> almost as much as .net
[11:39:59] <san> hope you well. I need help deciding on a table grid ajax based with pagination, filtering , sorting... Few options
[11:40:19] <san> - jqgrid, datatables or custom build...what you guys recon
[11:40:23] <dblosevn> microsoft is still leading the hated technologys list for me though lol
[11:40:32] <vinici> for every system, or every web idea, each one has the correct one language. for some things php is very useful, for others java is better
[11:40:33] <jeffsmykil> I suppose  I could use use Node?
[11:40:36] <vinici> and for others rails
[11:40:37] <vinici> and so on..
[11:40:53] <vinici> personally, i don't like .net too hehe
[11:41:06] <dblosevn> depends on what you want to do, if its resource intensive you dont want to use a high level programming lang like php
[11:41:18] <hugo_moss> hey, im trying to fadein my whole website when you visit it, but it only works after the first time, on the first time, you can see the images loading
[11:41:30] <jeffsmykil> nope not at all just high score storage and retreival dblosevn
[11:41:33] <dblosevn> youd want to use a precompiled lang such as java or .net
[11:41:35] <hugo_moss> it works when the webpage is on my local harddrive
[11:41:43] <vinici> :)
[11:41:50] <hugo_moss> but when posting on the server, it shows the images loading
[11:42:08] <vinici> hugo_moss probably because in your local the image loads very fast :)
[11:42:34] <vinici> what is obvious
[11:42:52] <dblosevn> ya it doesnt have to download anything when its local... duh
[11:43:18] <hugo_moss> how can i preload the images?
[11:43:51] <hugo_moss> nevermind
[11:43:57] <hugo_moss> found the answer on stackoverflow
[11:44:03] <vinici> hehe nice
[11:45:04] <dblosevn> i guess i should go to work lol

[11:59:31] <andi> I'm trying to create a ad with jquery which should work similar to the datepicker. But I do really not understand how datepicker is working. Can somebody tell me where to start understand the datepicker?
[11:59:47] <dblosevn> just added the text from textarea 1 to textarea2
[12:00:27] <andi> What I'd like to do is to have the possibility to add such a function to a input[type=text] field to choose items out of a list. This can't be that difficult.
[12:01:53] <andi> In the main.js file I'd like to use $('#myTextField').mypicker(); to start this picker for a specific input[type=text] field.
[12:02:56] <jrajav> Is there any reason why $('[class*="source-"]') would select classes like .source-css, .source-php, etc., but $('[class|="source"]') wouldn't?
[12:03:13] <jrajav> Can |= not be used for classes, or maybe I'm misunderstanding its usage?

[12:04:26] <jrajav> Oh, is |= actually saying that that string has to be a prefix for the whole attribute? So applied to 'class' the very first class listed must have that prefix?
[12:04:39] <andi> Ah, great. I think that is the explanation I've searched for. This will be a start. Thanks.

[12:08:17] <mudyc> I am generating a story from pieces of audio files. I
[12:08:46] <mudyc> am wondering how can I chain the play of each element
[12:09:21] <mudyc> so that next audio will be played after the end of the previous
[12:09:27] <MistuhKurtz> use the soundmanager2 library mudyc
[12:09:36] <MistuhKurtz> it will make your problem child's play
[12:10:08] <mudyc> sounds great, i will take a look
[12:13:32] <xerideas> I am having a strange issue.  I have an image roller that works fine in any brower but IE.  Strangely, it will work in IE.... if the developer tools are open.  It even works in IE 7/8 mode and quirks mode, but ONLY if the developer tools are open.  Website is http://www.rexburgmedicalcenter.com
[12:14:21] <systemfault> xerideas: forgotten console.log statements often cause that kind of problem
[12:14:30] <HarryPitfall> GoGoGarrett: the returns don't appear to be a "ajax", looks like a "iframe" body, and the content-type is text/plain
[12:15:06] <HarryPitfall> if you need to return data on a iframe, use text/html, if is a real ajax, use application/json
[12:15:13] <xerideas> systemfault so using console.log breaks IE?
[12:15:25] <systemfault> xerideas: Only when the console is not open
[12:15:45] <HarryPitfall> there is jquery plugin that emulates console
[12:16:02] <HarryPitfall> will open a small scrollable window on your page
[12:16:45] <systemfault> You could have something like: if (!window.console) { window.console = { log: function(){} }; }
[12:16:51] <systemfault> at the top of your JS
[12:17:30] <systemfault> That would prevent your JS from breaking your pages if you ever forget a console.log somewhere
[12:18:11] <xerideas> HarryPitfall what is the plugin called?  If I take out my 1 log statement, and the FB like script, it works, but I need to keep the FB.
[12:18:40] <systemfault> xerideas: ?
[12:18:43] <MistuhKurtz> console = window.console || { log: function(){} };
[12:18:57] <systemfault> xerideas: facebook is not the problem...
[12:19:18] <systemfault> xerideas: The evil console.log is at line 47 of jsFader.js
[12:19:18] <xerideas> systemfault if I take out my log function, it fails, if I take out my log function & FB, it works
[12:19:44] <xerideas> systemfault I took it out and am working off local webserver, its not up live yet
[12:21:40] <xerideas> ok guys, I put in the console jquery thingy and it works.  Thanks so much for your help now I can push this live.  I always hate trying to figure out IE.

[12:49:01] <madprops> hi, i'm trying to enable scroll/touchmove events for tablets, i can use the native touchmove but i can't get the direction up/down, how can i determine this?
[12:53:38] <andi> In this example: http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/jquery-plugin-template/ A variable radius is used and asigned to base.radius. base is a reference to this. So should I be able to access this.radius within the $.fn.youtPluginName?
[12:54:03] <andi> When I try that I'm unable to access the variable. Can you tell me how to access this value?
[13:00:10] <seich> andi: it all depends where you are trying to access it since, this might be pointing to something else
[13:00:34] <seich> andi: can't you use base.radius instead? I think that's the whole point of assigning it to "this"
[13:01:21] <dblosevn> andi: base is a refernce to this in the init function, youd access the option inside the plugin with this.options.radius
[13:01:41] <MarcGuay> Does anyone recognize this code?  https://www.assembla.com/code/sisgef/subversion/nodes/public/js/libs/admin/standard.js?rev=93
[13:02:45] <shoky> andi: after you've called $(el).yourPluginName(...) to initialize, you can access it with: var pluginData = $(el).data('yourPluginName'); console.log( pluginData.radius );
[13:03:08] <shoky> thanks to the line:   base.$el.data("yourPluginName", base);
[13:03:12] <r3v3rb> http://pastebin.com/kePKvMus line 6 errors with fieldset.clone is not a function any idea why?
[13:04:11] <r3v3rb> I am trying to create a stored version of the fieldset for reuse when a user clicks a button
[13:04:36] <andi> shoky: I'd like to access the radius within my plugin, so do I need to give the plugin name every time I'd like to access a property of the plugin?
[13:04:52] <shoky> r3v3rb: the [0] means fieldset will be a DOM node, not wrapped by a jquery object
[13:05:02] <andi> I just tried to access the variable via this.options.radius: TypeError: this.options is undefined
[13:05:07] <shoky> r3v3rb: use .eq(0) or .first() if you want the first match
[13:05:10] <shoky> as a jq obj
[13:05:15] <r3v3rb> thanks
[13:05:39] <shoky> andi:  from with the plugin.. base.radius should work
[13:07:02] <shoky> and if you want to access the options object.. use base.options
[13:07:13] <andi> shoky: I'd like to access this variable from within the $.fn.customerpicker function.
[13:07:20] <andi> base is not defined in there.
[13:07:57] <shoky> andi: after the call(s) to 'new $.customerpicker(..)'  ?
[13:08:15] <shoky> where it says 'have your plugin do stuff here' ?
[13:08:49] <andi> Yep
[13:09:24] <shoky> $(this).data('customerpicker').radius
[13:09:27] <shoky> i suppose
[13:09:56] <andi> http://pastebin.com/ttGZN589 This is what it looks like at the moment.
[13:10:16] <shoky> or, you could put the return value of the 'new ..'  into a variable
[13:10:22] <shoky> and access radius field from there
[13:10:36] <r3v3rb> fieldset still only has a pointer to the original fieldset not a copy by the looks of it… if that makes sense?
[13:10:46] <shoky> var instance = new $.customerpicker(...);  instance.radius
[13:11:48] <andi> Chaka, the instance solves the problem, thanks shoky. ;)

[13:17:04] <r3v3rb> fission6: post your code to jsfiddle
[13:17:07] <MistuhKurtz> well your question was vague and it would probably be easiest for everyone to just make a fiddle.
[13:17:08] <r3v3rb> ;)
[13:17:17] <MistuhKurtz> especially since it's a simple question
[13:17:52] <r3v3rb> any ideas on my fiddle ?
[13:18:42] <Slide-O-Mix> Is there a page on debugging jquery selectors?
[13:18:59] <NoiseEee> debugging a selector?
[13:19:02] <r3v3rb> fixed it, needed to clone the HTML into the var first then clone that where needed
[13:19:42] <EHLOVader> r3v3rb: you are removing the class from the first instance of the form and copying the same form for each subsequent copy of it
[13:19:57] <EHLOVader> it works the first time because it still has the add class
[13:19:58] <Slide-O-Mix> what I mean is I have a function that uses a selector to get all the input elements that have a name that starts with something, I want to verify all the elements are getting found correctly
[13:20:08] <EHLOVader> but it wont' subsequent times since it was removed after having duplicated it
[13:20:39] <r3v3rb> EHLOVader: I think thats because the original code in the fiddle is a pointer to the first occurance of the fieldset not a clone of it ;)
[13:20:45] <EHLOVader> exactly
[13:20:50] <EHLOVader> it was a reference, not a duplicate
[13:20:54] <r3v3rb> indeed
[13:20:58] <NoiseEee> Slide-O-Mix: well you can just console.log the result of the selector
[13:21:02] <EHLOVader> you could also solve it by simply explicitly adding the add class
[13:21:06] <r3v3rb> added .clone() to the var and its perfect
[13:21:10] <EHLOVader> but that may get a bit hairy
[13:21:13] <Slide-O-Mix> NoiseEee: hmm, good point
[13:21:17] <NoiseEee> Slide-O-Mix: but i mean, it either works or it doesn't - it's not going to get some and not others
[13:21:37] <JillesCode> Hey guise.. I am making my own upload script with jQuery, and I need to get the filename (without uploading it) but I have no clue how.. something like $('#upload').on('change?', function(){ $('#label').html($(this).fileName; }); or something?
[13:21:38] <r3v3rb> http://jsfiddle.net/EqaYP/1/ works perfectly
[13:21:43] <Slide-O-Mix> NoiseEee: right, its not doing what I expect at all right now...
[13:22:05] <NoiseEee> Slide-O-Mix: whats your selector / jsfiddle ?
[13:22:37] <Slide-O-Mix> NoiseEee: var checkBoxes = $('input[name|="elemStart"]');
[13:23:28] <Slide-O-Mix> The checkboxes are part of content that is loaded via ajax
[13:23:35] <NoiseEee> i think you want var checkBoxes = $('input[name^="elemStart"]');  as you mentioned "starts with"

[13:23:55] <natrixnatrix89> is there any other way to have 'this' still available in a function, without using an anonymous function like I did here: http://pastebin.com/5K8JCGXs
[13:23:59] <fubar10> I'm trying to create a pager above and below my slideshow.
[13:24:34] <Slide-O-Mix> NoiseEee: oh, ok, my bad
[13:25:05] <Slide-O-Mix> NoiseEee: thanks for the page, I'll bookmark it
[13:25:12] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[13:25:29] <shoky> natrixnatrix89: what do you mean? you can do: $(document).bind('mousemove', this.mmove);
[13:25:43] <Slide-O-Mix> NoiseEee: that worked perfectly, thanks
[13:27:14] <shoky> natrixnatrix89: ah maybe you mean access to 'this' inside mmove?
[13:27:18] <natrixnatrix89> shoky: that's exactly the problem I want to avoid.. because in that case 'this' will be the html element.. but I want it to be the instance of my object..
[13:27:22] <natrixnatrix89> yeah
[13:28:04] <shoky> natrixnatrix89: you can use .bind (or $.proxy) like:  $(document).bind('mousemove', this.mmove.bind(this))
[13:28:51] <shoky> two very different .bind()s
[13:29:11] <natrixnatrix89> and how bad practice is it using anonymous functions like I did?
[13:29:51] <george> hello please i am new to json and i want to know if i am please someone help me with this code  http://goo.gl/AyZbu
[13:29:55] <shoky> it's not, as long as your code is readable.. or in extreme edge cases for performance
[13:30:11] <NoiseEee> ?php @ george
[13:30:11] <bot-t> george, You're asking a JavaScript question but you're showing us PHP instead of HTML and JavaScript. Maybe your PHP code results in well-formed JavaScript code, maybe it doesn't; we don't know. Please show us the HTML JavaScript that the browser sees.
[13:30:13] <george> ok
[13:30:34] <george> please is there
[13:30:46] <george> html and javascript is there
[13:30:59] <george> and the response i am getting
[13:31:03] <george> [{"id":"1","keyword":"Welcome to Ghana"},{"id":"3","keyword":"Please we need peace in Ghana ASAP welcome"}]
[13:31:04] <natrixnatrix89> shoky: Good.. And about the example you described:
[13:31:05] <natrixnatrix89> $(document).bind('mousemove', this.mmove.bind(this))$(document).bind('mousemove', this.mmove.bind(this))
[13:31:05] <natrixnatrix89> That would imply having a bind() function iside my mmove function??? or how does that work?
[13:31:07] <shoky> george: $.each has the index as first argument
[13:31:22] <shoky> oops. nevermind me
[13:31:35] <shoky> er
[13:31:39] <george> so how do i pick the values from this output [{"id":"1","keyword":"Welcome to Ghana"},{"id":"3","keyword":"Please we need peace in Ghana ASAP welcome"}]
[13:31:52] <shoky> oh.
[13:32:02] <george> what i am doing wrong?
[13:32:02] <natrixnatrix89> But thank's for $.proxy.. I guess it does exactly what I was asking about..
[13:32:28] <shoky> george: $.each(data, function(i, key) { ..
[13:33:05] <george> how do you mean please?
[13:33:19] <shoky> natrixnatrix89:  javascript has a .bind function built-in for.. functions :P
[13:33:42] <george> @shoky so what do i alert?
[13:33:42] <shoky> ?g mdn bind @ natrixnatrix89
[13:33:43] <natrixnatrix89> ooh.. didn't know! thanks so much :D
[13:33:45] <bot-t> natrixnatrix89, bind - JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[13:34:11] <shoky> george: same thing, just change  function(key) to function(i, key)
[13:34:31] <shoky> george: why the [0]  in key.id[0]  ?
[13:34:46] <george> hmm not sure was just trying it out
[13:34:58] <shoky> just go for: console.log(key)
[13:35:08] <george> so what difference does it make when u add the i
[13:35:11] <adamo> i have a newbie question ;]
[13:35:21] <adamo> hopefully i wont get beated for asking it ;]
[13:35:37] <adamo> why does jquery not use the .protype method anywhere??
[13:35:49] <adamo> .prototype
[13:35:57] <shoky> george: it makes all the difference, that's how $.each is used if you look at the docs.. first argument to your callback is the index
[13:36:26] <george> oh ok
[13:36:30] <shoky> adamo: what do you mean..? jquery sure relies on prototypes..
[13:37:11] <adamo> hmm
[13:37:13] <adamo> one sec..
[13:37:57] <adamo> oh yeah
[13:37:59] <adamo> i does
[13:38:01] <adamo> however
[13:38:18] <adamo> i thought it would happen more often
[13:38:25] <adamo> in the source code
[13:38:33] <shoky> do you even know what you're asking..?
[13:38:36] <adamo> i just took a look at dojo source code
[13:39:02] <shoky> dojo and jquery are totally different things..
[13:39:10] <george> shoky so if i want to print in the body
[13:39:15] <george> how do i do that?
[13:39:28] <shoky> what body
[13:39:48] <george> i mean the html body
[13:40:08] <george> and also can i print it without using the $.each function?
[13:40:14] <NoiseEee> http://docs.jquery.com/Tutorials:Getting_Started_with_jQuery @ george
[13:40:21] <shoky> ^^ this
[13:40:33] <george> thanks
[13:40:40] <george> $('body').html();
[13:40:59] <shoky> $('george').hello();
[13:41:21] <george> what?
[13:41:35] <shoky> indeed
[13:42:18] <george> so exactly is the main purpose of json and ajax?
[13:42:27] <george> i am not getting it
[13:42:36] <NoiseEee> to update a part of a document without reloading it.
[13:42:45] <NoiseEee> if that makes sense to your app, go for it
[13:42:50] <NoiseEee> if it doesn't, don't shoehorn it in
[13:43:02] <shoky> and generally to communicate with your back-end server..
[13:43:23] <george> which one does this, json or ajax?
[13:43:32] <NoiseEee> json is a data transfer format.
[13:43:38] <george> ok
[13:43:38] <NoiseEee> ajax is slang for xhr / the actual request
[13:44:06] <george> so if one wants to do something like twitter which one?
[13:44:18] <ericw> does anyone know where i can find a pre-written script to bookmark a specified URL?
[13:44:25] <NoiseEee> they work together.  you typically do ajax and send/receive your data in convenient JSON format.
[13:44:36] <NoiseEee> george: read the getting started stuff, some intro stuff
[13:45:18] <george> oh ok
[13:45:44] <george> so it means that will format the data as json and transfer it using ajax?
[13:46:38] <NoiseEee> george: its up to you to format
[13:47:04] <george> oh ok
[13:47:12] <george> thanks alot
[13:47:15] <NoiseEee> good luck
[13:53:18] <nagle5000> Hi #jquery! I'm trying to change the background / text color on query-ui's tooltips, but changing the css for .ui-tooltip doesn't seem to do it. Any ideas?
[13:53:47] <nagle5000> (or rather, changing the color and background-color properties doesn't do it)
[13:56:36] <george> so if i want some data to be picked without refreshed how do i do that? @NoiseEee
[13:57:19] <NoiseEee> george: picked?
[13:58:01] <george> i mean reading the data from the database and showing on browser without refreshing
[14:00:03] <gnarf> nagle5000: see what selectors are applying the current styles, but its probably .ui-content or .ui-state-default
[14:00:30] <gnarf> nagle5000: you might have to make a more specific selector than just ".ui-tooltip" to beat those other style rules
[14:00:40] <gnarf> like ".ui-tooltip.ui-state-default" or whatever
[14:00:55] <nagle5000> gnarf: i'll look at those. thanks! what confuses me is how to say, inspect element of the tooltip -- since it only appears on hover, to figure out where it's getting it's css rules from
[14:01:17] <gnarf> nagle5000: it also appears on focus
[14:01:19] <gnarf> and stays
[14:01:29] <gnarf> so you could use that to inspect it :)
[14:01:33] <nagle5000> gnarf: oh! ok that's a good idea
[14:01:38] <NoiseEee> george: you send an ajax request to your backend saying what you need, get the response, and update the DOM as you wish
[14:01:49] <NoiseEee> george: http://andreehansson.se/the-basics-of-jquery/ and the other tutorials.  good luck.
[14:02:04] <george> thanks alot

[14:05:02] <bot-t> New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[14:05:05] <shoky> ?learn
[14:05:06] <bot-t> First learn JavaScript (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/learn/javascript) then learn jQuery (http://jqfundamentals.com/)
[14:11:32] <smoothlists> Hi.  I use this JS file in my page: jquery.min.js.  My page looks fine, but when I open it in IE, the status bar says "Error on page."  The error is "'length' is null or not an object."
[14:11:54] <smoothlists> Why would I get an error for a file I never altered (jquery.min.js)?
[14:12:22] <razzi> smoothlists, it looks like you're selecting a non-existing element.
[14:12:28] <jita> I want to create widget for my web app such that it could be integrated into other web pages. Should i make it an iframe ? Or there is some other alternatives?
[14:13:39] <hugo_moss> how can i iterate through all background-images in my document?
[14:13:49] <hugo_moss> css images
[14:14:19] <Quix0r> can you guys help me? http://mxchange-demo.de/install.php <-- call that method (you cannot install it) and wait for the AJAX test to happen, then hit "Interaktive Version". a JavaScript error happens. it didn't happen with older versions of jquery: JSON.parse: unexpected character
[14:14:35] <Quix0r> sorry for the CSS error there. it is already fixed in latest SVN :)
[14:15:15] <gnarf> Quix0r: what version are you upgrading from?
[14:15:22] <Quix0r> http://mxchange-demo.de/install.php?installer=ajax <-- this is the right one
[14:15:37] <Quix0r> gnarf: I then have to look into my SVN log
[14:15:49] <smoothlists> razzi: I'm not sure what you mean by non-existing element.  Can you give me an example?
[14:15:58] <gnarf> Quix0r: also, is the JSON response valid? use ?jsonlint
[14:15:59] <bot-t> Quix0r, JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[14:16:07] <fission6> funny handle for your issue smoothlists
[14:16:45] <smoothlists> you mean my username?
[14:16:49] <fission6> yea
[14:16:54] <Quix0r> gnarf: yes, the JSON is valid
[14:16:56] <smoothlists> it's just a random name
[14:17:01] <fission6> tight
[14:17:05] <Quix0r> that bot is nice :)
[14:17:47] <Quix0r> i checked the json again, it is still valid
[14:18:12] <gnarf> Quix0r: any chance you can use a non minified build of jQuery there to test?
[14:18:13] <Quix0r> 1.6.2 -> latest stable
[14:18:25] <gnarf> Quix0r: it's really hard to debug inside minified
[14:18:27] <smoothlists> is there an obvious solution to my error?
[14:18:37] <Quix0r> gnarf: what is minified? compressed?
[14:18:51] <Quix0r> ah, okay. you mean uncompressed
[14:18:53] <gnarf> you're using jquery.min.js - use the uncompress version
[14:19:04] <Quix0r> okay, I put it there
[14:19:31] <smoothlists> but this version was working fine.  then I made a few changes to my PHP file, and now i receive the error, even though everything appears to still work
[14:20:06] <smoothlists> i'm trying to determine what i did to cause the error.  i didn't edit the jquery file
[14:20:21] <hugo_moss> anyone know an easy way of getting all background images within the dom of a page?
[14:21:05] <Quix0r> gnarf: it is uploaded there now
[14:21:11] <Quix0r> http://mxchange-demo.de/install.php?installer=ajax
[14:21:38] <george> hello i did this http://goo.gl/EgfS5 but ajax is not loading the data automatically unless i refresh the page. why is that so?
[14:22:23] <gnarf> so Quix0r: http://cl.ly/image/2A1u2E3j2E0w
[14:22:43] <gnarf> Quix0r: http://cl.ly/image/3b2U1i09172p
[14:23:14] <gnarf> Quix0r: You're parsing the "reply" which is "ajax_content.reply_content" - which isn't JSON
[14:23:43] <gnarf> It's actually "%3Cdiv+align%3D%22center...
[14:23:58] <gnarf> also, why the hell are you URL encoding that response string from the server?
[14:23:59] <Quix0r> okay
[14:24:12] <Quix0r> because it causes errors when I don't do it :(
[14:24:20] <Quix0r> but I can change that to test it
[14:24:51] <Quix0r> ah, I see it now
[14:25:00] <george> please any reason why my ajax code is not reloading automaticaly unless i manually refresh?
[14:25:01] <Quix0r> reply_content comes from my scripts
[14:25:20] <george> http://goo.gl/EgfS5
[14:26:00] <gnarf> Quix0r: the extra encoding just seems wasted IMO
[14:26:13] <gnarf> but do what you must
[14:26:18] <Quix0r> i check that out
[14:26:34] <gnarf> but don't $.parseJSON strings that aren't JSON :)
[14:26:44] <Quix0r> $GLOBALS['ajax_reply']['reply_content'] = urlencode(doFinalCompilation($content, FALSE)); <-- from PHP code
[14:26:53] <gnarf> why urlencode it?
[14:26:55] <gnarf> thats what I'm sayin
[14:26:56] <Quix0r> I might have reasons for that
[14:27:01] <Quix0r> yes, hm
[14:27:20] <gnarf> JSON should be fully capable of expressing every char without urlencode
[14:29:02] <Quix0r> at least I need to escape the double-quotes or it will break the json
[14:30:28] <Quix0r> i think I see my logic error, thanks gnarf for opening my eyes for it :)
[14:30:36] <hugo_moss> anyone know an easy way of getting all background images within the dom of a page?
[14:30:39] <Quix0r> and I try to avoid that urlencode() call
[14:32:54] <Quix0r> jay! fixed thank you a lot :D
[14:33:08] <gnarf> Quix0r: json_encode in php will automatically escape the "
[14:34:02] * Quix0r raises hands for a sign of happiness :D
[14:35:06] <hugo_moss> anyone know an easy way of getting all background images within the dom of a page?
[14:35:35] <Quix0r> Syntax error, unrecognized expression: input#{_page
[14:35:38] <gnarf> hugo_moss: there isn't one - it would involve selecting every element and filtering
[14:35:38] <Quix0r> the next one :(
[14:36:06] <gnarf> Quix0r: are you trying to select an input with the id="{_page" ?
[14:36:11] <gnarf> seems wrong
[14:36:20] <Quix0r> that {_ looks strange
[14:37:20] <Quix0r> Sizzle.error = function( msg ) {     throw new Error( "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: " + msg ); };   <-- it origins here
[14:37:22] <gnarf> hugo_moss: $( "*" ).map( function() { var bg = $.css( this, "background-image" ); if ( bg.length ) { return bg; } }).get();
[14:37:29] <gnarf> Quix0r: look up the stack
[14:37:30] <Quix0r> that is jquery's exception
[14:38:09] <gnarf> Quix0r: but it's hapening because you passed an invalid selector in
[14:38:15] <gnarf> look at the call above it in the stack
[14:38:32] <Quix0r> okay
[14:38:40] <gnarf> Quix0r: you using chrome?
[14:38:53] <Quix0r> firefox with firebug
[14:39:26] <gnarf> Quix0r: well i don't know where the option is in firebug - but in chrome - you set it to "purple pause" to break on uncaught exceptions http://cl.ly/image/3F360f23000L
[14:39:46] <Morkel> i have a problem with my find() http://jsfiddle.net/jMx6g/ it can not find the link
[14:39:48] <Quix0r> ok
[14:40:13] <gnarf> Morkel: .filter()
[14:40:18] <gnarf> Morkel: find looks for children
[14:40:29] <Morkel> gnarf: thanks
[14:53:29] <brainwarped> Hi! I'm using the jsTree widget in django and was wondering which approach to populating the data is faster: json_Data or html_data?
[14:59:56] <adam007> hello i get TypeError: $("#datepicker").datepicker is not a function because i use both of datepicker and fancybox
[15:00:00] <adam007> how to fix that ?
[15:01:25] <adam007> anyone here ?
[15:03:38] <xboi209> when i set a height with .css(), the element still takes up its original height in white spac
[15:05:01] <Quix0r> okay, that is also fixed (not the url-encoding, stuff)
[15:08:20] <ansdev1> hi, i have a drag/drop... everything is perfect.. but when someone moves over the droppable and away from it without actually dropping the item... the item just freezes on the screen at a random place... despite both draggable and droppable using 'revert'
[15:09:05] <relipse> are there any jquery mobile developers here?
[15:14:31] <hugo_moss> anybody know a good looking jquery progress bar?
[15:15:20] <Quix0r> commit is out and will be up shortly :)

[15:27:06] <Quix0r> gnarf: http://mxchange-demo.de/install.php?installer=ajax
[15:27:12] <Quix0r> it is working now :D
[15:27:46] <Quix0r> okay, the last one is unfinished
[15:28:25] <george> hello @Quix0r can u help me with ajax?
[15:28:48] <george> i want the ajax to load automatically without any refresh
[15:29:27] <Quix0r> george: sorry, I don't know :(
[15:29:46] <george> hnmm i did this http://goo.gl/dse2u
[15:29:53] <george> but is not working anyone to help me out?
[15:31:10] <fission61> george: are you getting json
[15:31:23] <george> yes
[15:31:34] <george> unless i refresh b4 i get it
[15:31:41] <george> but i dont want that
[15:31:41] <fission61> wait so whats wrong
[15:32:27] <george> i want that code to load the data without a refresh from manually
[15:32:40] <george> like how twitter works
[15:32:53] <fission61> that code should work when the page loads
[15:33:16] <george> yes it loads when i click on refresh
[15:33:31] <george> but i thought it could reload without me clicking on refresh
[15:33:48] <george> so if there is new record it shows it automatically?
[15:33:50] <george> or?
[15:34:54] <fission61> no
[15:35:02] <fission61> youneed to trigger the reload somehow
[15:35:08] <fission61> wether by button
[15:35:11] <george> hmm so how can i achive that please
[15:35:12] <fission61> interval (time)
[15:35:20] <george> like how plse
[15:35:23] <fission61> or you can use websockets for more "real time"
[15:35:34] <george> can how?
[15:35:34] <fission61> here is using a button http://jsfiddle.net/ZLDxU/
[15:36:07] <george> but i want something which is auto or real time
[15:36:18] <fission61> look at websockets
[15:36:34] <fission61> but that seems overkill if you can't get anything more incremental to work
[15:36:47] <george> lol
[15:37:03] <george> just needed a sample
[15:37:09] <george> or the interval type
[15:48:04] <ansdev1> hi, i have a drag/drop... everything is perfect.. but when someone moves over the droppable and away from it without actually dropping the item... the item just freezes on the screen at a random place... despite both draggable and droppable using 'revert'
[15:48:38] <george> hello @fission61 how do i combine with this setInterval(function() {
[15:48:38] <george> 	    $("#hello").load(location.href+" #content>*","");
[15:48:39] <george> 	}, 5000);
[15:50:22] <snover> ?g setinterval evil @ george
[15:50:24] <bot-t> george, setInterval is (moderately) evil - Tales from the Evil Empire - http://weblogs.asp.net/bleroy/archive/2009/05/14/setinterval-is-moderately-evil.aspx
[15:50:40] <snover> WHAT IN THE WORLD

[15:50:47] <bot-t> george, Why I consider setInterval to be harmful | Blog | Zetafleet | Web ... - http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
[15:50:49] <snover> there we go
[15:52:20] <george> u mean is not advisable to use it?
[15:52:26] <george> so whats the best option?
[15:52:45] <systemfault> setTimeout
[15:53:51] <systemfault> setTimeout(function foo() { doSomething(); setTimeout(foo, 5000); }, 5000);  something more or less like that
[15:54:18] <systemfault> The inner setTimeout would be in the success handler of your ajax call
[15:54:55] <jacobroufa> george - http://www.erichynds.com/javascript/a-recursive-settimeout-pattern/
[15:55:56] <systemfault> Even better :)
[15:56:03] <jacobroufa> george - i implemented it here http://e-rockford.com/elections/results/results.js if youd like to see in practice, line 53
[15:56:16] <jacobroufa> systemfault - yeah dude, that article saved my ass
[15:56:19] <jacobroufa> really sweet pattern
[15:56:20] <george> like this http://goo.gl/yxSQG?
[15:56:29] <fission6> you may also want to consider doing setTimeout in a $.getJson().done() block
[15:56:43] <george> ok thnx alot i am looking at it
[15:57:08] <jacobroufa> fission6 - george - use .done() so you can chain multiple callbacks
[15:57:43] <jacobroufa> ie - act on the ajax info as well as reset the timer, so you can separate functionality a bit more precisely
[15:58:21] <george> hmm i am new to it oo so the terms are :P
[15:58:31] <george> when u say chain how do you mean>
[15:58:33] <george> ?
[15:59:18] <systemfault> geeeek: myObject.done(function() { doSomething(); }).done(function() {doSomethingElse(); })............
[15:59:26] <systemfault> Err
[15:59:32] <systemfault> Sorry geeeek
[15:59:42] <systemfault> george ^
[16:00:07] <george> hehee
[16:01:45] <jacobroufa> george - or myObject.done( function(), function2() );
[16:01:57] <fission6> george: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/ASkY4/
[16:02:11] <george> oh ok great
[16:04:18] <george> but will this be loading the data without manually hitting on refresh?
[16:04:30] <ansdev1> hi, i have a drag/drop... everything is perfect.. but when someone moves over the droppable and away from it without actually dropping the item... the item just freezes on the screen at a random place... despite both draggable and droppable using 'revert'
[16:04:52] <fission6> george: yea
[16:05:21] <george> holy sweet
[16:05:50] <fission6> did it work
[16:06:02] <_bart> Hi, is query smart enough to animate with -webkit-filters and such?
[16:06:34] <_bart> $(elem).animate({"-webkit-filter": "grayscale(50%)"}, 'fast');
[16:07:05] <george> nopes i tested this first http://goo.gl/rCBw7 and is failing
[16:07:11] <george> testing the other one too
[16:07:25] <george> @fission6
[16:10:19] <george> @fission6 syntax error
[16:10:48] <fission6> well fix it!
[16:10:51] <systemfault> _bart: Why don't you add/remove classes instead of animate?
[16:11:08] <systemfault> _bart: If your browser supports filters.... it definitely supports CSS transitions
[16:11:41] <george> yeah is fixed but is not loading
[16:12:58] <fission6> paste your code
[16:13:06] <george> ok
[16:14:40] <systemfault> _bart: http://jsfiddle.net/ftjCq/
[16:16:07] <_bart> systemfault: yes cool, the difficulty is that I have to use a combination of a grayscale calculated by javascript (dependent of scroll position) and of classes
[16:16:28] <_bart> systemfault: when I apply a class that already has style="filter…" with a grayscale, it doesn't work
[16:16:32] <george> @fission6 http://goo.gl/5wdwP
[16:17:29] <_bart> systemfault: $(this).attr("style", ""); :p
[16:17:33] <_bart> it works, thanks
[16:18:03] <fission6> george: i can't tell from that what doesn't work
[16:18:12] <fission6> you should put a console.log statement in their
[16:18:51] <fission6> bump line 5 down and put in console.log(data) tell me what it prints and wether it prints every 3 seconds
[16:18:58] <george> @fission6 ok done that
[16:18:58] <b-ot> george, not tagged as amd within that containing module's build profile script?
[16:19:21] <gnarf> b-ot: you're crazy
[16:19:22] <b-ot> gnarf, no YOU'RE crazy
[16:19:26] <MrPunkin> in safari after a few .ajax calls if I refresh the page it renders the JSON result of the last AJAX, not the actual HTML page. Any ideas?
[16:21:20] <george> doing this now http://goo.gl/1QtJn
[16:21:22] <george> but still
[16:21:56] <george> @fission6
[16:23:25] <george> @fission6 please what am i doing wrong?
[16:24:40] <jacobroufa> george - where's testjson.php?
[16:25:20] <george> is in same location as the file containing this file
[16:27:58] <george> hello
[16:31:37] <george> @jacobroufa please can you help me
[16:32:58] <fission6> george: can you paste an example of your json packet
[16:33:09] <fission6> basically the output when you directly hit testpage.php
[16:33:35] <jacobroufa> george - http://pastebin.com/dwtvW5vn
[16:33:51] <george> ok @fission6
[16:34:07] <gnarf> better yet, look in the network tab of the debugger for the response to that ajax call
[16:34:21] <jacobroufa> george - erm. this. http://pastebin.com/GgrWnp8X
[16:34:24] <george> [{"id":"1","keyword":"Welcome to Ghana"},{"id":"3","keyword":"Please we need peace in Ghana ASAP welcome"}]
[16:34:54] <gnarf> george: is that what you get from the network tab too?
[16:35:05] <gnarf> like is it requesting it from the correct location?
[16:35:14] <george> yes
[16:35:23] <gnarf> and whats the issue with the code?
[16:35:34] <george> when i run the testjson.php that is what i get
[16:36:10] <gnarf> george: did you open the debugger, and look at the request in the debugger? or are you just assuming that the info is correct?
[16:37:41] <george> which debugger i am using firebug
[16:38:00] <bung> anyone have any best practices for writing functions that return like 'all' 'none' 'some' ?
[16:38:05] <bung> what do you return thats cleanest
[16:38:17] <gnarf> george: http://jsfiddle.net/uJpTQ/
[16:38:24] <george> @jacobroufa i see is running in firebug but is loading the testjson.php itself and not the script file
[16:38:26] <gnarf> george: firebug has a network panel
[16:38:40] <george> yes
[16:38:51] <gnarf> look at the request
[16:38:54] <gnarf> it should work
[16:39:01] <gnarf> what is the issue anyway?
[16:39:06] <gnarf> like what isn't working?
[16:39:21] <george> is not loading the data itself
[16:39:50] <gnarf> i'm seeing console.log's in that fiddle
[16:39:50] <gnarf> so
[16:39:52] <gnarf> the code works
[16:40:01] <gnarf> your request must be failing for some reason
[16:40:10] <fission6> george: http://jsfiddle.net/7puZQ/8/
[16:40:16] <gnarf> which could be - malformed JSON response, etc - look on the console/debugger
[16:40:56] <george> this one is working
[16:41:29] <fission6> gnarf: whats your general syntax rules in terms of styling out of curiousity
[16:41:30] <george> but see so i replace /echo/json/ with my code right?
[16:41:49] <fission6> george: no, the examples we offer are doing a POST to emulate a webservice, you already have one
[16:41:50] <gnarf> fission6: jQuery Core Style Guide?
[16:42:02] <fission6> so change $.ajax to $.getJSON
[16:42:10] <gnarf> fission6: http://docs.jquery.com/JQuery_Core_Style_Guidelines
[16:42:18] <fission6> gnarf: i mean like when to indent, new line etc
[16:42:40] <george> ok great
[16:42:51] <gnarf> fission6: most of the rules are there
[16:42:54] <george> so how will i get it one by one instead of all at once
[16:42:57] <fission6> gnarf: for instance http://jsfiddle.net/uJpTQ/ why did you break after the { in the first return
[16:43:13] <gnarf> fission6: cuz i hit "tidy up"
[16:43:14] <fission6> george: get what one by one?
[16:43:15] <gnarf> fission6: :)
[16:43:21] <fission6> whats that?
[16:43:25] <otherj> anyone aware of something like bootstrap's typeahead that can fill multiple fields?
[16:43:25] <gnarf> "tidy up" button on the fiddle?
[16:43:28] <fission6> oh ok
[16:43:29] <gnarf> it formats it for you
[16:43:35] <george> lol the contents
[16:43:36] <fission6> anything like that in sublimetext by change
[16:43:38] <gnarf> i would have put one there anyway tho
[16:43:48] <george> i was pulling the data from db
[16:44:12] <gnarf> fission6: almost every { is followed by a \n
[16:44:15] <fission6> change your web service?
[16:44:54] <fission6> george: you have to do some of this yourself
[16:45:05] <george> ok sire
[16:45:10] <george> i am still learning
[16:45:14] <george> thanks alot
[16:45:17] <george> i am testing it
[16:49:12] <george> wooow is working like charme
[16:49:17] <george> thanks alot all
[16:50:44] <bung> anyone written any functions with three possible returns latey, any good practices for something like that? a function that returns a comparison result like 'some' 'all' 'none' ?
[16:51:00] <george> @fission6 is working so cool thanks alot. i will try to see if i can get the records one by one like how twitter works
[16:55:53] <fission6> what do you mean by how twitter works
[16:55:58] <fission6> what do you want to ultimte do
[16:59:56] <skegeek> Which specific file do I need to include to use show and hide effect functions?
[17:06:41] <katsh> is it possible to get everything between two html elements? even the things between them contain html elements?
[17:09:28] <bung> skegeek: just regular old jquery
[17:10:01] <bung> katsh: you could start with .siblings() and see where that gets you
[17:10:37] <shoky> bung: didn't really understand your question
[17:11:16] <bung> shoky: yea its a bit weird to describe, heres a function i just posted http://stackoverflow.com/a/13280799/1132629
[17:11:41] <bung> it just seems weird returning 'all' 'none' 'partial' ... but 0,1,2 wouldnt be that good either
[17:12:44] <katsh> bung: i don't see how that helps
[17:12:48] <shoky> uh.. depends how you wanna use it
[17:12:57] <gnarf> katsh: see ?demo
[17:12:58] <bot-t> katsh, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[17:13:01] <katsh> for instance, i want everything between the <body> tag and </body>
[17:13:15] <bung> $('body').children();
[17:13:24] <bung> maybe read the dom traversal page
[17:13:38] <katsh> i dont have any code to provide because i dn't know if what i want to do is possible. im asking if there's a method for grabbing everything between to elements. or inside an element
[17:13:41] <bung> http://api.jquery.com/category/Traversing/
[17:13:53] <gnarf> katsh: what do you mean by "grabbing everything"?
[17:13:57] <gnarf> like you can select all the elements
[17:14:05] <katsh> grabbing it into text/string
[17:14:11] <gnarf> katsh: the html of it?
[17:14:17] <gnarf> or the DOM representation?
[17:14:24] <gnarf> see ?html
[17:14:26] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[17:14:26] <bung> shoky: yea exactly, depends what i want for my other code processing the result, no worries its a dumb question
[17:16:05] <katsh> right. html would work, but it grabs contents from inside an element. so if i wanted to grab everything between <body> and, say, </html>
[17:16:23] <bung> $('body').html()
[17:16:37] <bung> as long as theres nothing between </body> and </html>
[17:16:42] <bung> thats everything
[17:17:01] <katsh> but if there is. i was just using those as example
[17:17:09] <bung> there shouldnt be
[17:17:11] <katsh> it'll be  between certain divs
[17:17:22] <katsh> actually
[17:17:31] <katsh> one sec :)
[17:17:57] <bung> one thing to clear up, theres no 'between <body> and </html>' theres the contents of <body />
[17:17:57] <katsh> yeah html will work. thank you
[17:18:23] <bung> or body itself if you want
[17:18:36] <bung> end tags arent seperate in the way you seem to think
[17:18:38] <DeltaHeavy> Is jQuery down or does Chrome just explode when serving local files?
[17:18:54] <shoky> wat
[17:18:54] <b-ot> After search on the Internet for almost one day, FINALLY I have the best solution to do this: Resize a dive to full page size!! Thanks you great work!!!
[17:18:55] <bung> DeltaHeavy: chrome probably
[17:19:25] <DeltaHeavy> There's nothing wrong with this line right? <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
[17:19:31] <DeltaHeavy> Cause it apperently can't get it
[17:20:53] <shoky> what does that have to do with 'jQuery down' or chrome exploding on local files..
[17:22:06] <DeltaHeavy> I'm getting this error: GET http://elearnology.co/ecourses/vids/new/js/vendor/modernizr-2.6.2.min.js 404 (Not Found)
[17:22:21] <DeltaHeavy> On this line: <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.8.2/jquery.min.js"></script>, before it was telling me it couldn't get jQuery
[17:23:18] <shoky> wha.
[17:23:36] <DeltaHeavy> I'm hosting it now and I"m getting the same thing
[17:23:40] <DeltaHeavy> http://elearnology.co/ecourses/vids/new/
[17:24:30] <shoky> it's  a 404 on the modernizr js..
[17:24:37] <bung> lol
[17:24:40] <bung> was going to say
[17:24:48] <shoky> jquery is being loaded fine
[17:25:52] <DeltaHeavy> The error is on jQuery. Before I was getting it on jQuery too but it stopped after messing aroudn with stuff. I have NO idea why this is happening. Why is it getting THAT location for my modernizr link anyway?
[17:25:58] <bung> is this yet another online learning startup
[17:26:07] <DeltaHeavy> Yep, not my idea
[17:26:22] <shoky> DeltaHeavy: cause you have  <script src="js/vendor/modernizr-2.6.2.min.js"></script>
[17:26:24] <shoky> ..
[17:26:39] <DeltaHeavy> shoky: Where?
[17:26:52] <shoky> 2 lines below jquery include..
[17:26:54] <DeltaHeavy> I just see src="modernizer-2.6.2.min.js"
[17:27:10] <shoky> nope
[17:28:03] <DeltaHeavy> I swear to god some shit is screwed up somewhere on my comp right now
[17:28:04] <DeltaHeavy> I am NOT seeing that
[17:28:13] <DeltaHeavy> Ready to just reformat this thing
[17:29:28] <bung> i see it too http://imgur.com/Hm0gh
[17:29:38] <bung> thats from viewsource on your site
[17:29:49] <DeltaHeavy> Yeah, something is seriously messed up on my end
[17:29:55] <DeltaHeavy> I'm 100% sure I'm not being an idiot about this
[17:30:21] <shoky> quite confident
[17:30:24] <bung> can I sign you up for some porn newsletters in the meantime?
[17:44:51] <chovy> $("span").fadeIn() results in display: block;
[17:47:00] <randomdev> Any idea why I would be getting "Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'getElements' " only in google chrome when it works on ie and firefox?
[17:47:14] <chovy> http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/dk5Ua/
[17:47:27] <chovy> randomdev: what is the line?
[17:47:51] <randomdev> this.items = this.el.getElements('li');
[17:48:00] <randomdev> script works fine in ie and firefox
[17:48:16] <randomdev> this.el = document.id(el); before that
[17:48:32] <chovy> is that jquery?
[17:48:46] <randomdev> I think so?
[17:48:55] <randomdev> is it mootools?
[17:53:01] <xboi209> im using a callback function and inside of it, i'm using .find() on the data variable, i'm able to select what i want and it outputs perfectly in console.log but when i try to use .html on the current page to insert the new data, only the first element is shown
[17:56:43] <fission6> xboi209: can you recreate in jsfiddle
[17:56:56] <xboi209> ik
[17:57:32] <aqeel> hi room
[17:57:51] <fission6> yo
[17:57:53] <aqeel> how can i get the hold of elemeent which is loaded from external html file
[17:59:04] <someprimetime> xboi209: aren't you from stockton?
[17:59:17] <xboi209> yeah, we talked about that b4
[17:59:36] <someprimetime> nice i'm pretty sure i met someone else with a 209 name in either here or #javascript
[17:59:42] <xboi209> that was me
[17:59:50] <someprimetime> in addition to you
[17:59:51] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/BrBCD/
[18:00:01] <someprimetime> but one was from modesto
[18:00:11] <someprimetime> 209 taking over
[18:01:03] <xboi209> yo how do i whisper someone
[18:01:08] <fission6> aqeel: that fiddlelooks incomplete
[18:01:13] <xboi209> fission6: i dont want the link to the public
[18:01:46] <fission6> just create a fiddle which replicates your issue xboi209
[18:01:52] <someprimetime> can you try $('data').contents().filter()?
[18:02:00] <xboi209> im actually using a proxy to load data from another website
[18:02:08] <fission6> ok
[18:02:36] <xboi209> callback function if success
[18:02:49] <xboi209> then $(data).find() on it
[18:02:57] <fission6> is it html
[18:02:58] <xboi209> with .each() and callback function on that
[18:03:00] <fission6> getting returning
[18:03:03] <aqeel> i cant say about incomplete but that is all i have then this function is put into if else statement.....
[18:03:04] <xboi209> html?
[18:03:26] <fission6> xboi209: aqeel we need more complete code to see what your doing
[18:03:37] <xboi209> i can send you my jsfiddle link
[18:03:37] <aqeel> ok
[18:03:40] <xboi209> but i dont want it public
[18:03:57] <fission6> just change the sensative stuff like url
[18:04:01] <fission6> just not the logic
[18:04:44] <clarkpan> i was wondering if anyone can help me with using a script loader (such as requirejs) and jquery
[18:04:50] <xboi209> http://jsfiddle.net/tqkup/
[18:04:53] <clarkpan> specifically with an issue with the 'ready' event
[18:05:03] <xboi209> http://jsfiddle.net/tqkup/1/
[18:05:57] <xboi209> oh and i tried experimenting with .replaceWith but same results as .html()
[18:06:13] <xboi209> i tested .append() and it works fine
[18:06:19] <xboi209> all data is shown with .append()
[18:06:24] <xboi209> and console.log
[18:06:36] <fission6> xboi209: does this work http://jsfiddle.net/tqkup/4/
[18:07:52] <xboi209> that works but that's because it uses .append()
[18:07:59] <xboi209> im trying to replace an element on the current page
[18:08:13] <fission6> so your code isn't indicative of your issue
[18:08:28] <fission6> you can't loop through using each and have a replaceWith
[18:08:33] <fission6> it will just overwrite
[18:08:35] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/BrBCD/2/
[18:08:38] <xboi209> ?
[18:08:42] <aqeel> it is something like this
[18:09:28] <xboi209> i think i see the reason why .each() isn't doing what i wanted
[18:09:39] <clarkpan> how about this
[18:09:40] <clarkpan> http://jsfiddle.net/tqkup/5/
[18:09:55] <fission6> aqeel: sorry still dont understand your fiddle or question maybe someone ele will
[18:11:10] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/BrBCD/3/
[18:11:29] <xboi209> clarkpan: that works :D
[18:11:34] <clarkpan> xboi
[18:11:36] <clarkpan> what each does
[18:11:43] <clarkpan> is it runs that function you passed into it
[18:11:48] <clarkpan> for each dom element that it finds
[18:12:05] <clarkpan> so what you've done is replaced the content in that main content section
[18:12:14] <clarkpan> over and over again
[18:12:26] <xboi209> i see
[18:12:40] <xboi209> so
[18:12:59] <xboi209> couldnt i have put the .find() into a variable
[18:13:06] <fission6> sure
[18:13:09] <xboi209> and then select the element i want to replace and use that variabl
[18:13:31] <fission6> update teh fiddle xboi209 to show what you mean
[18:13:57] <clarkpan> that 'variable' you've stored from the return value of .find()
[18:14:00] <fission6> aqeel: sorry still to much going in their for me to understand, whats your actual question with this
[18:14:11] <clarkpan> is a jquery object
[18:14:15] <xboi209> something like this: http://jsfiddle.net/tqkup/6/
[18:14:36] <clarkpan> that should work yes
[18:14:43] <clarkpan> test it!
[18:15:14] <aqeel> after the code is loaded from external html ...how can i make use of its elements in local file (file contents loaded into)
[18:15:26] <xboi209> yeah, im correct :D
[18:15:31] <clarkpan> awesome
[18:15:33] <xboi209> much less coding than yours clark :p
[18:15:39] <fission6> xboi209: xboi209 you probably want this http://jsfiddle.net/tqkup/7/
[18:15:54] <xboi209> why the money sign
[18:15:55] <aqeel> as you can see if i want to use #buttonOK from extrnal file i have to use on() for bubbling it to surface of body
[18:16:01] <clarkpan> haha yea nice
[18:16:11] <fission6> its just a handy way to signifigy the variable is a jQuery object
[18:16:20] <fission6> doesn't mean anything just easier to understand
[18:16:22] <fission6> and referfence
[18:16:47] <xboi209> so if jquery code is inside a variable, i should just put the money sign in front of it to indicate it's a jquery object?
[18:16:58] <aqeel> now i wan to add text to the element #customalerttext, but this is loaded from external file
[18:17:10] <fission6> well it depends if whats on the right side produces a jQuqery object
[18:17:12] <fission6> you can
[18:17:13] <aqeel> how do i acces this element
[18:17:16] <clarkpan> xboi209: thats just a convention
[18:17:23] <clarkpan> not everyone agrees with it
[18:17:23] <xboi209> o
[18:17:43] <fission6> if i did var some_string = $('document').text(); i would not use $some_string because its not a jQuery object, i get a string back
[18:17:43] <clarkpan> decide for yourself if you see any value in it
[18:17:44] <xboi209> ive seen stuff like var $this = $(this) before or something like that, confused me a lot
[18:17:54] <fission6> xboi209: i do that a lot
[18:18:02] <fission6> it makes this, a jQuery object
[18:18:14] <clarkpan> end of the day, as long as you and your team understand the code, and explain your conventions to others
[18:18:14] <fission6> and then caches it so i can use $this throughout the scope
[18:18:22] <clarkpan> its fine
[18:18:28] <fission6> its just convention xboi209
[18:18:32] <xboi209> ok
[18:18:38] <xboi209> i understand now
[18:18:39] <xboi209> :D
[18:18:40] <xboi209> thanks
[18:18:50] <clarkpan> np
[18:19:58] <aqeel> i can't simply make use of them just by calling it like a regular html file will
[18:20:10] <fission6> aqeel: you are not depicting your issue very well
[18:20:25] <fission6> are you saying, you get html from an ajax call and you want to do jQuery selection on it?
[18:20:35] <aqeel> yes
[18:20:47] <ryanneufeld> that's easy
[18:20:51] <fission6> get the info and in the call back to var $my_remote_html = $(data)
[18:21:42] <fission6> so for example var $my_remote_html = $('<div>whatever</div>'); $my_remote_html.text();
[18:22:16] <fission6> ^this is what your fiddle should have looked more like when you cut your issue down to as small as possible
[18:22:54] <aqeel> thanks
[18:22:58] <aqeel> will try out now
[18:23:38] <jim_m> hi all
[18:24:35] <jim_m> if I have a <ul class="name1 name2">  what do I use to select it in $(" ").after?
[18:24:56] <jim_m> is is $(".name1 .name2").after with a space between the two?
[18:24:57] <fission6> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/3mv8d/
[18:25:12] <fission6> jim_m: depends
[18:25:23] <fission6> you may select other things with that
[18:25:31] <jim_m> it needs to be specific to that ul
[18:25:43] <fission6> well do you get more than 1 ul with those classes
[18:25:55] <fission6> also do you control the html? can you give the ul an id=
[18:26:17] <jim_m> it's uniquely named on the page
[18:27:15] <jim_m> it doesn't have an id, but I do have a div after it that has:  <div id="postcontent" class="clearfix">
[18:27:28] <jim_m> so maybe I can use $(" ").before instead?
[18:27:53] <fission6> http://jsfiddle.net/3mv8d/1/
[18:27:58] <fission6> your call
[18:29:24] <jim_m> same thing if it's <ul class="class1 class2"></ul> ?
[18:29:45] <fission6> yea class selectors
[18:29:54] <jim_m> great
[18:29:55] <jim_m> thanks
[18:29:57] <fission6> np
[18:38:13] <aqeel> well what i want is the opposite of that.....fission6
[18:38:42] <aqeel> i want to grab the element focus and add text to it from current html
[18:39:21] <fission6> well you got to simplified your issue cause i dont follow
[18:41:14] <aqeel> i loaded a chunk of code from external html into current html, how can i get hold of element by id or class or whatever from this chunk of code and have it manupulaated...
[18:47:54] <fission6> i told you above dude
[18:48:25] <sunbeam> I have this simple code to open and close a sub ul
[18:48:28] <sunbeam> http://pastebin.com/QAzsfbE5
[18:48:31] <sunbeam> any idea what I do wrong?
[18:48:42] <sunbeam> it only works once
[18:49:43] <fission6> sunbeam: the second selector never binds the click handler because no elements at the time of the page load have the class state-closed
[18:49:50] <fission6> sunbeam: checkout out toggleClass
[18:52:33] <sunbeam> fission6: they do
[18:52:49] <fission6> create a fiddle
[18:54:19] <fission6> sunbeam: also you cna create the click handler on the ul not the <a>
[18:54:50] <fission6> finally you are just hidding the ul or showing it?
[18:55:02] <fission6> how does someone click on something thats hidden
[18:56:28] <sunbeam> fission6: toggleClass did it
[18:56:29] <sunbeam> sorry
[18:56:41] <fission6> ok
[18:56:50] <fission6> can you make a fiddle, i think what your doing can be easier
[18:57:36] <sunbeam> i'm just doing this now
[18:57:37] <beachandbytes> you can treat html strings as dom elements by just wrapping them in $()
[18:57:58] <sunbeam> jQuery("ul > li a").click(function() { jQuery(this).closest('li').toggleClass("state-open"); return false; });});
[18:58:03] <fission6> anyone using backbone or have a rec for an alertnative
[18:58:06] <sunbeam> This is in Wordpress, can't use $
[18:58:39] <fission6> sunbeam: seems weird why you need to click on a link to toggle state but whatever
[18:58:57] <sunbeam> to have the hidden content (inside) the link show
[18:59:47] <beachandbytes> fission6 backbone is a good framework
[18:59:50] <beachandbytes> what are you trying to do
[19:00:05] <sunbeam> fission6: jQuery("ul > li a").click(function() { jQuery(this).closest('li').toggleClass("state-open"); return false; });});
[19:00:20] <sunbeam> how can i create the toggleClass action with .animate() ?
[19:02:36] <fission6> sunbeam: what does your toggleClass do, like what do those classes do, again, making a fiddle would be ideal to get a great answer
[19:02:44] <fission6> beachandbytes: have you used angleularjs
[19:03:12] <AntonKor_> first time seeing closest() in jquery, is it faster then parents()
[19:03:22] <AntonKor_> ?
[19:04:32] <sunbeam> fission6: i just pasted it, when that class its added the only thing that happens is .state-open ul{display: block;}
[19:04:57] <fission6> AntonKor_: they are different, if something is a parent, use parent
[19:05:17] <fission6> sunbeam: right so you dont need class
[19:05:22] <fission6> you can just use toggle();
[19:05:46] <beachandbytes> AntonKor_ no it is not faster
[19:06:22] <AntonKor_> ic, good to know that its there though
[19:06:48] <sunbeam> fission6: you're right
[19:06:59] <sunbeam> but, i actually need to use it when the page loads
[19:07:09] <sunbeam> (have the class added)
[19:08:05] <fission6> do whatever
[19:13:16] <jerry_> guys what would selector be when i have this nesting <div class="class1">      <div class="class2">                  <div class="class3">                              <img class="class4">...
[19:13:32] <jerry_> i want to select images with class4 nested inisde 3 divs
[19:13:32] <fission6> jerry_: what do you want selected
[19:13:53] <fission6> $('img.class4')
[19:13:55] <jerry_> fission6: all images that are inisde 3 divs and have class4
[19:14:00] <jerry_> fission6: thanks you
[19:14:10] <fission6> that will find all though just to be clear
[19:14:21] <fission6> not nessarily inside 4 divs
[19:15:15] <jerry_> yeah but image selected must be class r4
[19:15:18] <jerry_> class4
[19:17:42] <jerry_> fission6: you see i have this class name that has spaces inisde its name and i have trouble selecting it
[19:19:50] <AntonKor_> this might help you out: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2178416/jquery-using-starts-with-selector-on-individual-class-names
[19:20:01] <fission6> jerry_: you can't have classes with a space in the name
[19:20:38] <AntonKor_> having a space means its a 2nd class name ^^
[19:20:44] <fission6> yes i know
[19:20:52] <aqeel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4194347/jquery-loading-external-html-content-access-to-elements-inserted-fails.............resembles my problem...
[19:21:23] <jerry_> fission6: ok its kind of like this    class="name something-something"
[19:22:33] <fission6> aqeel: that cuold be your issue
[19:22:42] <fission6> you need to wait until load is complete before doing a selector
[19:22:48] <jerry_> fission6: so do i create selector for this
[19:22:51] <fission6> whats the link to your code again
[19:23:18] <fission6> jerry_: are you asking how do you select something with two specific classes
[19:24:35] <jerry_> well when i check source code of the page my element is inside 3 divs and <img class="something something-something">
[19:24:59] <fission6> i mean you have to tell me what th eideal selector would be and i can tell you the syntax
[19:25:05] <fission6> i dont know the pafe structure
[19:25:14] <dblosevn> $('img.class1.class2');
[19:25:28] <fission6> aqeel: where is your code
[19:26:26] <jerry_> dblosevn: tx
[19:26:35] <AntonKor> does anyone know of a IRC for responsive web design/ dev
[19:26:39] <AntonKor> im new to this irc thingie
[19:26:53] <fission6> AntonKor: a channel?
[19:26:59] <AntonKor> yeah
[19:27:03] <dblosevn> lol
[19:27:21] <AntonKor> what the funny?
[19:27:22] <dblosevn> maybe #css could help
[19:27:27] <fission6> yea join #css or / and #twitter-bootstrap
[19:27:40] <AntonKor> ic
[19:28:05] <AntonKor> well the question is related to jquery, sorta
[19:28:30] <dblosevn> AntonKor: funny == "a IRC" && "irc thingie"
[19:28:44] <AntonKor> yeah, that new :D
[19:29:19] <someprimetime> twitter bootstrap has its own channel lulz
[19:29:35] <dblosevn> wow movin up
[19:29:47] <dblosevn> i might play with it one day
[19:29:50] <AntonKor> how do you guys write your js/ jquery for responsive design
[19:30:09] <someprimetime> lol moving up from -20
[19:30:09] <AntonKor> i been doing it like this guy does:https://github.com/eddiemachado/bones/blob/master/library/js/scripts.js
[19:30:13] <someprimetime> to -19
[19:30:17] <dblosevn> AntonKor: I usually let my css determine my layout
[19:30:32] <dblosevn> I try never to make layout changes with js
[19:30:43] <coldhead> dblosevn++
[19:30:48] <AntonKor> but there is js that needs to do differnt things differntly acrross differnt devices
[19:30:50] <someprimetime> we're doing it @ work right now and it's a pain in the DICK
[19:31:19] <coldhead> pain in the dick might be cancer, someprimetime. i'd get a doctor to take a look
[19:31:21] <fission6> bootstrap is very nice for responsive design
[19:31:24] <someprimetime> mainly re-ordering of divs which isn't that bad but it's got a resize handler on it which was not my design decision
[19:31:30] <dblosevn> coldhead++
[19:31:45] <someprimetime> and resizing of content blocks which is to me just absurd and too much bloat
[19:31:48] <someprimetime> but that's just my opinion
[19:32:03] <someprimetime> and i prefer zurb's foundation if i'm using a css "framework"
[19:32:27] <fission6> i love bootstrap for prototyping
[19:33:08] <dblosevn> ive kinda fallin into ext with the jquery adapter best of both worlds
[19:33:46] <sunbeam> how can I access the nearest parent li?
[19:33:51] <sunbeam> eg i have this
[19:33:57] <sunbeam> ul li a ul li a
[19:33:59] <dblosevn> $(this).closest('li')
[19:34:03] <sunbeam> the last a is clicked
[19:34:05] <someprimetime> that ^
[19:34:13] <fission6> i told you to just pyt the clicked handler on the li or even the ul
[19:34:13] <sunbeam> nop
[19:34:16] <dblosevn> $(this).closest('li').closest('li')
[19:34:22] <sunbeam> dblosevn: probably
[19:35:03] <dblosevn> wait
[19:35:08] <dblosevn> thats not even valid
[19:35:18] <dblosevn> ul cant be a decentand of a
[19:35:27] <dblosevn> decendant even
[19:35:36] <clarkpan> any core contributors here?
[19:35:41] <dblosevn> and a definitely cant be a decdenant of a
[19:35:43] <fission6> sunbeam: wont post a fiddle
[19:35:58] <clarkpan> I'd like to ask what the state of using 'interactive' for readyState is?
[19:36:01] <dblosevn> damn keyboard
[19:36:16] <dblosevn> ul li ul li a would be valid
[19:36:29] <dblosevn> but not ul li a ul li a
[19:36:48] <coldhead> it sounds cool when you say it out loud
[19:36:56] <dblosevn> lol
[19:39:56] <dblosevn> i hate pc repair lol been dickin with this damn chicks computer all day
[19:40:00] <someprimetime> so http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/RrmNm/27/ if you click `down` and then click `up` it should change the vote to 11 which is how it should… but if you first click `up` and then click down, the score is @ 10 when it should be @ 9… can someone help me figure out this logic?
[19:42:12] <fission6> someprimetime: i'd make seperate handlers for clicking up and down for starters
[19:43:18] <fission6> and put the count as a var outside the click handler scopes
[19:44:09] <fission6> someprimetime: i assume there is not magic to this right you want up to go up one and down to go down one
[19:44:41] <dblosevn> looks like up 2 and down 1
[19:44:48] <someprimetime> fission6: right… when you initially vote. but if you've already voted up and are now voting down, the delta is -2
[19:44:50] <dblosevn> delta on up is 2
[19:45:07] <someprimetime> unless it's on 0, in which case it'll stay @ 0 because i don't want to show a negative count
[19:45:31] <dblosevn> why do that at all
[19:45:37] <someprimetime> so if it's initially at a count of 0, you vote up 1.. delta is 1. now you vote down, delta should be just 1 and stay @ 0
[19:45:47] <someprimetime> because i don't want to show a negative score
[19:45:47] <dblosevn> you already have orginal value stored in data
[19:45:50] <someprimetime> since it's irrelevant to me
[19:45:53] <fission6> im cnfused
[19:45:58] <someprimetime> look @ reddit's voting
[19:46:06] <dblosevn> add 1 or substract one from orginalvalue
[19:46:15] <dblosevn> if < 0 set to 0
[19:46:24] <dblosevn> that simple
[19:46:30] <fission6> he is doing omething weird with counting though it looks like
[19:46:36] <fission6> like some sort of state logic
[19:46:39] <dblosevn> ya he overcomplicated it
[19:46:50] <dblosevn> just orig + or - 1
[19:47:03] <dblosevn> less then 0 = 0
[19:47:12] <someprimetime> yeah it's becoming too convulated
[19:47:47] <someprimetime> s/ulated/aluted
[19:47:52] <dblosevn> let me plug my monitor back in lol
[19:47:55] <coldhead> convoluted*
[19:48:09] <someprimetime> woops
[19:51:09] <fission6> http://jsfiddle.net/RrmNm/28/ someprimetime
[19:51:29] <someprimetime> wtf
[19:51:30] <someprimetime> lol
[19:51:42] <someprimetime> where are the bounds?
[19:52:10] <fission6> i dont know i just laid the basics out, what do you mean bounds
[19:52:20] <fission6> i didn't replicate all the logic just the core
[19:59:10] <xboi209> :/ i cant join the #php channel
[19:59:41] <someprimetime> try ##php or register your nick if it's not
[20:00:22] <xboi209> how 2 register
[20:00:23] <xboi209> :o
[20:00:35] <someprimetime> message /nickserv i think
[20:00:44] <gnarf> xboi209: /msg nickserv help register
[20:00:44] <someprimetime> fission6: i think i might just store it in a data attribute
[20:00:45] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/mfmK3/
[20:01:15] <gnarf> someprimetime: why is all the logic inside the down click?
[20:01:48] <someprimetime> gnarf: well it was inside of one handler but fission6 suggested having two handlers… i'd most likely end up refactoring but i just wanted to see it work real quickly
[20:02:08] <someprimetime> original: http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/RrmNm/27/
[20:03:51] <xboi209> does anyone here happen to know php?
[20:04:20] <bubu> anyone familiar with the ui tabs and loading via ajax?
[20:04:59] <coldhead> does anyone here have any specific questions rather than questions about questions?
[20:05:06] <xboi209> meh
[20:05:13] <xboi209> but it doesnt belong in this channel

[20:07:27] <someprimetime> :*
[20:07:38] <dblosevn> only if your boobs are big enough
[20:08:16] <someprimetime> i'm rocking a solid A cup
[20:08:21] <someprimetime> that big enough for you?
[20:08:23] <coldhead> ew
[20:08:27] <coldhead> please
[20:08:31] <coldhead> my innocence
[20:08:35] <someprimetime> don't be jealous coldhead
[20:08:35] <dblosevn> not even close to being in my league
[20:08:46] <someprimetime> well am i at least in the ballpark?
[20:08:48] <someprimetime> on the stands?
[20:08:51] <dblosevn> D`s or betta round hurr
[20:09:02] <bubu> everytime i clicked a tab loaded via ajax, it re-requests the html even though the tab has already been loaded before.
[20:09:14] <someprimetime> the only D's i've got are duracell but i thank you for the help
[20:09:18] <someprimetime> maybe Eviltwin can satisfy you more
[20:09:23] <someprimetime> or Hypah
[20:09:24] <dblosevn> lol
[20:09:52] <coldhead> bubu: you see anything on the docs about cacheing?
[20:09:57] <coldhead> because that's what it sounds like
[20:10:01] <someprimetime> pretty clean solution btw dblosevn
[20:10:02] <someprimetime> thanks
[20:10:10] <dblosevn> np
[20:10:45] <bubu> coldhead: i didnt see anything in the jquery docs, but ill try googling that
[20:11:18] <bubu> coldhead: but for some reason, on the jquery ui examples page, it's not re-requesting the html for each tab
[20:11:38] <bubu> it requests it one time, and then never again
[20:12:07] <someprimetime> do you have the cache option set to true?
[20:12:08] <someprimetime> cache: true
[20:12:40] <someprimetime> if so try setting it to false
[20:13:00] <coldhead> bubu: it might be related to the cache expiry headers from the server
[20:13:29] <coldhead> but $.tabs({ cache: true, ... looks promising
[20:14:05] <bubu> that seems to make sense, i just didnt see the cache flag set on the examples page
[20:14:34] <coldhead> yeah, might be the server config then
[20:14:43] <coldhead> bloody ajax and servers. makes eveyrthing so gomblicate
[20:14:46] <bubu> im not even sure if cache is a valid option
[20:14:51] <coldhead> it is
[20:15:00] <bubu> ok, not documented
[20:15:04] <coldhead> it's just not on the wretched focs
[20:15:05] <coldhead> docs*
[20:15:06] <gnarf> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/mfmK3/2/
[20:15:09] <coldhead> stupid UI

[20:15:11] <gnarf> :)
[20:15:13] <coldhead> GOD I HATE IT
[20:15:18] <bubu> lol
[20:15:24] <bubu> those Fing slackers
[20:15:46] <someprimetime> gnarf: i don't want to be caught in this love triangle
[20:15:48] <someprimetime> but i do
[20:15:49] <coldhead> if i could punch them in the backs of their heads i would
[20:16:10] <someprimetime> damn that's pretty elegant as well
[20:16:18] <bubu> i went into their dev channel once
[20:16:24] <bubu> they weren't very nice
[20:16:58] <someprimetime> bubu: you can seek refuge in here
[20:17:13] <dblosevn> gnarf: doesnt work right
[20:17:18] <coldhead> here, suckle at someprimetime's bosom
[20:17:23] <someprimetime> o wut
[20:17:24] <dblosevn> gnarf: adds 2
[20:17:24] <gnarf> dblosevn: see ?doesn't work
[20:17:33] <bot-t> dblosevn, ajax doesn't work with JS as response on IE9 - Bug Tracker - jQuery - Opened 15 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10124
[20:17:36] <gnarf> dblosevn: if you switch from up to down, it actually changes by 2
[20:17:41] <gnarf> you remove a + and replace with a -
[20:17:58] <dblosevn> never mind it does
[20:18:06] <bubu> THAT WAS IT
[20:18:08] <bubu> cache: true
[20:18:09] <bubu> omg
[20:18:13] <bubu> amazing
[20:20:04] <dblosevn> gnarf: i was right it doesnt work lol if count is 0 it goes negative
[20:20:05] <coldhead> hooray for everything
[20:20:07] <gnarf> dblosevn: :) doesn't make sense at first, but it does...
[20:20:16] <gnarf> dblosevn: well, can you not downvote from 0?
[20:20:22] <gnarf> you could add a rule for that pretty easily
[20:20:25] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/8pTFJ/
[20:20:33] <dblosevn> lol i handled for that
[20:20:53] <dblosevn> cleaner though
[20:21:24] <gnarf> dblosevn: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/mfmK3/4/
[20:21:51] <dblosevn> lol nice
[20:22:04] <gnarf> oops
[20:22:16] <someprimetime> haha
[20:22:28] <gnarf> should be clicked instead of buttons

[20:22:33] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/mfmK3/7/
[20:22:41] <dblosevn> ya was gonna say dont work at all now lmao
[20:22:46] <coldhead> YOUR HURTING I CAN FEEL IT
[20:23:19] <gnarf> i still think if you have that kind of vote control
[20:23:22] <gnarf> negative is valid
[20:23:27] <gnarf> but whatevs
[20:24:04] <someprimetime> i'm basically doing it because i don't want to hurt any user's feelings
[20:24:15] <munderwo-work> Hi all. Im running into a issue where firefox is throwing an unresponsive script error. From my understanding this is when a whole chunk of javascript runs synchronously without letting the browser get back control. I've found the code that is causing this. One fix i've seen is to use setTimeout to break the synchronous nature of the funciton up. BUt i havent had great luck with doing this. I was wondering if Jquery deferred would al
[20:24:15] <someprimetime> if they see they submitted something that has like -666 they'll probably stop contributing
[20:24:17] <someprimetime> which is good and bad
[20:24:30] <bubu> someprimetime: thanks for help!
[20:24:33] <dblosevn> see it on youtube all the time lmao
[20:24:34] <someprimetime> good because they are probably submitting shit content, but i don't want to lose any people
[20:24:45] <someprimetime> bubu: np thank coldhead though he knows more than me
[20:25:54] <dblosevn> .is is tight, never used it before or knew of its existance
[20:26:17] <someprimetime> tight like denim
[20:26:25] <gnarf> dblosevn: also see ?hasClass
[20:26:26] <bot-t> dblosevn, .hasClass(className): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[20:26:28] <someprimetime> yeah i should have been using that instead of hasClass
[20:26:38] <gnarf> they are about the same
[20:26:44] <someprimetime> it's shorter though to write
[20:26:46] <someprimetime> and looks cleaner imo
[20:26:47] <gnarf> yeah
[20:26:50] <gnarf> agree
[20:28:35] <someprimetime> damn i think doug crockford blocked me from google+
[20:28:47] <someprimetime> he updated his profile pic and i said something like "who is this handsome man" and now i can't see his damn posts
[20:29:12] <bung> gnarf: thats a cool problem, my attempt http://jsfiddle.net/AyevP/2/
[20:29:17] <someprimetime> wtf he removed my comment. guess i should have done what the rest of the flock was doing and +1'd it
[20:32:17] <dblosevn> bung: keeps letting you vote and vote lol
[20:32:41] <bung> oh is there  a limit?
[20:32:50] <bung> i didnt really read up i just made it work how i thought
[20:32:52] <dblosevn> ya generally you can only vote once
[20:33:03] <bung> so what, use a cookie?
[20:33:07] <dblosevn> can change your vote up or down or remove it
[20:33:16] <bung> thats a quick if check against a cookie value in the code and return false
[20:33:18] <someprimetime> bung: class or data-attribute to save state
[20:33:19] <bung> im not doing that for him
[20:33:20] <dblosevn> look at mine or gnarfs example
[20:33:42] <dblosevn> they both comply with all his requirements
[20:33:46] <someprimetime> bung: it's cool i've already done it. just in a shittier version until gnarf and dblosevn improved it
[20:34:00] <bung> oh its your original problem
[20:34:07] <bung> i didnt really scroll up
[20:34:08] <bung> :)
[20:34:20] <someprimetime> cool is a really unfortunate nick to have
[20:35:12] <ansdev1> hi. i have some content that is inserted dynamically into a page which changes the height of a container... now it's children elements are set to height:100% but they don't update to the new height :(
[20:35:18] <ansdev1> any way i can force this?
[20:35:24] <bung> still i mean why would you use a data attribute
[20:35:31] <bung> someone refreshes the page and votes again
[20:35:55] <gnarf> someprimetime: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/mfmK3/8/
[20:35:56] <bung> should be hooked in on the ajax call
[20:36:00] <someprimetime> well it is
[20:36:02] <someprimetime> presently
[20:36:04] <dblosevn> bung: oviously he will make an ajax call onVote and the orginal value will be updated on page load
[20:36:09] <someprimetime> it gets sent to my controller and saved to the db
[20:36:13] <someprimetime> but this is for quick visual feedback
[20:36:39] <dblosevn> bung: we just workedout the frontend logic for him
[20:36:51] <someprimetime> gnarf: www.ijustlearned.com user: ijl pass: preview
[20:37:01] <someprimetime> that's the old logic of it
[20:37:28] <gnarf> someprimetime: let me offer a suggestion btw
[20:37:31] <someprimetime> sup
[20:37:40] <gnarf> force the backend to only accept POST for voting
[20:38:12] <someprimetime> yeah i'm using cakephp and check if($this->request->is('post'))
[20:38:16] <someprimetime> or whatever it is
[20:38:24] <someprimetime> +1 though thx
[20:38:46] <gnarf> someprimetime: yeah, its a really easy system to game otherwise
[20:38:55] <dblosevn> even still is
[20:39:00] <gnarf> true
[20:39:02] <dblosevn> id tie the vote to a post/ip
[20:39:18] <dblosevn> or post/user
[20:39:33] <dblosevn> if the users are authenticated
[20:39:34] <gnarf> but even easier if you can <img src="/url/to/thing/vote?vote=up" width="0" height="0"> in a post ;)
[20:39:46] <someprimetime> votes are tied to user_id
[20:40:12] <gnarf> someprimetime: ^^^ if someone posted that in a post on the site, they could make every user vote themselves up (if GET is allowed)
[20:40:13] <someprimetime> and it checks to see if they've already voted and will just change the vote based on it
[20:40:27] <someprimetime> gnarf: interesting
[20:40:34] <bung> jsfiddle sure is slow for me tonight
[20:40:42] <someprimetime> but yeah i tie an ip as well
[20:40:45] <dblosevn> lol, could make a post to a redirector that would post to the service too
[20:40:53] <gnarf> dblosevn: not with their cookie
[20:40:55] <gnarf> :)
[20:41:04] <dblosevn> tru have to be an iframe
[20:41:08] <ansdev1> any way i can force this?
[20:41:11] <ansdev1> hi. i have some content that is inserted dynamically into a page which changes the height of a container... now it's children elements are set to height:100% but they don't update to the new height :(
[20:41:11] <dblosevn> image cant run js
[20:41:21] <someprimetime> http://i.imgur.com/gnXa4.png table
[20:42:08] <gnarf> someprimetime: ip wouldn't matter there either - just sayin --- if someone can request with GET - they can just hotlink an image to the vote url and everyone viewing the page automatically vote for the post(s) they want :)
[20:42:36] <bung> there now im happy, thats super clean imho http://jsfiddle.net/AyevP/7/
[20:42:36] <someprimetime> oh wtf
[20:42:47] <bung> how you liek them apples
[20:42:49] <gnarf> someprimetime: thats why i said MAKE SURE it's post :)
[20:42:59] <dblosevn> bung: it doesnt work at all now
[20:43:06] <someprimetime> thanks yeah wow
[20:43:11] <bung> what doesnt work now?
[20:43:22] <bung> the ones you already voted dont work, the ones you didnt vote work
[20:43:46] <bung> all you have to do is pooch the .data('voted','1) line when your ajax shit is done
[20:43:59] <dblosevn> you can change or remove your vote, you just cant vote up more then once or down more then once
[20:44:07] <bung> lol
[20:44:11] <bung> stop changing requirements!
[20:44:15] <someprimetime> lmao
[20:44:19] <bung> like my clients
[20:44:20] <bung> hahaha
[20:44:22] <dblosevn> lmao
[20:45:12] <dblosevn> its been the requirement since the begining, your one of thoughs devs i have under me that i have to contantly scold for not reading the specs
[20:45:22] <dblosevn> :-D
[20:45:26] <bung> lol i didnt scroll up still
[20:45:27] <bung> haha
[20:45:29] <someprimetime> bahaha
[20:45:48] <dblosevn> thats what they say too
[20:46:00] <bung> well it wouldnt be hard to change the return false check for .changed or something
[20:46:05] <bung> or 'changed' whatever
[20:46:37] <dblosevn> its all good lol
[20:47:05] <gnarf> yes - my version is perfect ;)
[20:47:12] <dblosevn> as is mine lol
[20:47:22] <dblosevn> oh i thought that said vision lmao
[20:47:30] <someprimetime> LOL
[20:48:02] <dblosevn> on 3 computers right now one with dual monitors just glanced lmao
[20:48:08] <coldhead> the irony is that gnarf is legally blind
[20:48:15] <dblosevn> damn it i hate windows
[20:48:24] <dblosevn> BSOD 1A
[20:48:41] <gnarf> BOFH?
[20:48:55] <dblosevn> this chick is hot but shes gonna have to get over it her pc isnt gonna be done tomorrow
[20:49:03] <gnarf> http://bofh.ntk.net/BOFH/
[20:49:18] <coldhead> gnarf: finger bofh@wisc.edu
[20:49:35] <dblosevn> BSOD http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Screen_of_Death
[20:49:43] <bung> so all im missing is 'cant go below zero' and 'can change once' ?
[20:51:07] <dblosevn> cant go below 0 can change as many times as you want but cant vote up or down more then once
[20:51:29] <bung> i see
[20:51:29] <dblosevn> so if votes were 10 the you could toggle back and forth between 9 and 11
[20:51:52] <dblosevn> or remove your vote completely bringing it back to 10
[20:52:19] <someprimetime> you can vote and the delta will always be 1 originally.. so you vote up: add 1.. vote down: minus 1… BUT if you voted up and now want to vote down, the delta becomes 2 and vice versa
[20:52:37] <someprimetime> unless the score is @ 0 in which case it will never go below 0 when you vote down
[20:52:53] <someprimetime> if you want to see a live example.. reddit.com vote on anything
[20:53:34] <someprimetime> they minified their code but it's essentially: http://pastebin.com/2cwJHAVD
[20:54:11] <captain_hook> Anyone know a good jquery gallery ?
[20:54:42] <dblosevn> i like fancybox
[20:54:49] <gnarf> someprimetime: i think mine would minify smaller
[20:54:49] <gnarf> :)
[20:55:05] <someprimetime> yeah +1

[20:56:56] <dblosevn> 743 :-)
[20:57:13] <dblosevn> but to be fair you did the ajax call too
[20:57:58] <gnarf> dblosevn: use uglify or something that munges vars
[20:58:05] <dblosevn> and what is up with jsfiddle
[20:58:16] <someprimetime> jsfiddle is fine for me
[20:58:22] <dblosevn> it always adds one bad unicode char at the end of copied text
[20:58:25] <someprimetime> i'm on west coast isf it matters
[20:58:28] <someprimetime> s/sf/f
[20:58:36] <someprimetime> OH
[20:58:36] <gnarf> dblosevn: http://jquery.chosd.com/4
[20:58:39] <someprimetime> yeah what the hell is that?
[20:58:43] <someprimetime> <b200> or something
[20:58:49] <someprimetime> whenever i paste into vim it'll do that
[20:58:58] <dblosevn> 537 chars
[20:59:10] <dblosevn> @gnarf
[20:59:20] <gnarf> dblosevn: u on a mac?
[20:59:27] <dblosevn> no win 8
[20:59:30] <gnarf> dblosevn: lame
[20:59:50] <dblosevn> i have a mac though and my centos box is my main machine
[20:59:59] <gnarf> dblosevn: was gonna say, just sudo npm install -g uglify-js - then you can pbpaste | uglifyjs | pbcopy
[21:00:12] <gnarf> dblosevn: does centos have something like pbpaste?
[21:01:08] <dblosevn> not seeing it sure i could compile it from source though
[21:01:16] <dblosevn> theres a ubuntu rpm
[21:01:57] <gnarf> super useful util
[21:02:39] <dblosevn> ive got a ubuntu box but dont use it much
[21:02:54] <dblosevn> still learning the distro
[21:04:17] <gnarf> pbpaste and pbcopy are like so amazing
[21:04:41] <bung> dblosevn: if you take something like this, it should just be a matter of doing math on was/votes/vote to figure out if you need to return false: http://jsfiddle.net/AyevP/9/
[21:04:41] <gnarf> at least for an old-school bash hacker like myself
[21:04:41] <dblosevn> what do they do?
[21:04:53] <gnarf> dblosevn: copy/paste from command line as a pipe
[21:05:02] <bung> doing arithmetic*
[21:05:15] <dblosevn> bung: your fired 5 times now it still aint right lmao
[21:05:23] <bung> read what i said
[21:05:26] <bung> its not done
[21:05:36] <bung> you have to figure out the math for the return false statement and youre done
[21:05:52] <dblosevn> bung: its not even for me lol
[21:05:57] <gnarf> dblosevn: i.e. " git diff | pbcopy "
[21:06:01] <gnarf> then go paste it somewhere
[21:06:04] <bung> blame english for not having a plural you
[21:06:23] <dblosevn> now im throughly confused :::
[21:07:23] <dblosevn> they say `hey you's wise guys` all the time in the old mafia movies lol
[21:08:06] <EasyCo> If you bind more then one event to a DOM object like: $(elem).on("mousedown focusing", function() {…}) and both events trigger at once, is there a graceful way to only run the function() once?
[21:08:10] <dblosevn> gnarf: ya thats cool
[21:08:22] <aqeel> sorry fission6 had to go out now am back
[21:08:28] <EasyCo> *focusin
[21:08:49] <gnarf> EasyCo: define "at once" because thats not techincally possible
[21:08:52] <gnarf> :)
[21:09:20] <dblosevn> is focusing event an event
[21:09:26] <EasyCo> As in, if you click on an input field, it'll trigger both mousedown and focusin
[21:09:27] <dblosevn> *even
[21:09:52] <gnarf> but you might want to look at something like http://lodash.com/docs#debounce
[21:09:53] <bot-t> Ben Alman » jQuery throttle / debounce: Sometimes, less is more! - http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[21:10:05] <coldhead> lol b-ot
[21:10:11] <coldhead> lol bot-t even
[21:10:12] <gnarf> coldhead: that was bot-t :)
[21:10:28] <coldhead> sorry gnarf it's my first day using nick completion
[21:10:31] <dblosevn> ?focusing
[21:10:36] <bot-t> dblosevn, #8157 (Focusing an already focused text field will prevent the ... - Opened 21 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8157
[21:10:47] <dblosevn> not exactly lol
[21:10:55] <dblosevn> i dont think thats a valid event
[21:10:56] <rmill> b-ot: move faster, k?
[21:10:57] <b-ot> rmill, signs point to yes.
[21:11:01] <gnarf> EasyCo: you can debounce the function so that only the "first" or "last" call in "x"ms
[21:11:05] <gnarf> dblosevn: "focusin"
[21:11:13] <gnarf> dblosevn: i assumed the "g" was just a typo
[21:11:48] <dblosevn> oh i assumed you bound focus for that
[21:11:57] <dblosevn> and blur for focusout
[21:11:59] <gnarf> EasyCo: you could also store a state locally and if it's already been fired, you can ignore it
[21:12:08] <gnarf> dblosevn: they have different meaning
[21:12:14] <gnarf> ?focusin
[21:12:15] <bot-t> .focusin(handler): Bind an event handler to the "focusin" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/focusin/
[21:12:38] <gnarf> "The focusin event is sent to an element when it, or any element inside of it, gains focus. This is distinct from the focus event in that it supports detecting the focus event on parent elements (in other words, it supports event bubbling)."
[21:12:54] <dblosevn> oh nice
[21:12:56] <gnarf> focus and blur don't bubble
[21:13:08] <dblosevn> would have helped me out on a previous project or two
[21:15:04] <EasyCo> gnarf, I think that's what I might do. I kind of assumed that if you bound multiple events and more then one triggered simultaneously (i.e focusin and mousedown), only one call would be made.
[21:15:38] <gnarf> they don't trigger "simultaneously"
[21:15:43] <gnarf> mousedown triggers
[21:15:47] <gnarf> then focusin triggers
[21:15:48] <dblosevn> js runs in a single thread, so technically it would not trigger at the same time
[21:15:53] <EasyCo> Potato potahto
[21:15:54] <dblosevn> ^^gnarf
[21:16:05] <EasyCo> What I meant is they both get ran
[21:16:06] <gnarf> two events happen, two calls to your handler
[21:16:17] <gnarf> if you debounce it tho, it should catch it
[21:16:42] <dblosevn> that word still makes me chuckle lol
[21:17:02] <dblosevn> im still not even sure it is a word lmao
[21:17:52] <coldhead> it's more of a word than "performant"
[21:17:58] <coldhead> that word should be taken out and shot

[21:19:48] <coldhead> http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/performant
[21:20:08] <bung> someprimetime: still there?
[21:20:09] <coldhead> stay classy, dblosevn
[21:20:15] <dblosevn> unsure
[21:20:20] <someprimetime> yeah actually refactoring dblosevn's atm XD
[21:20:28] <bung> someprimetime: does this work? http://jsfiddle.net/eS5ax/
[21:20:35] <someprimetime> or someone's i forget at this point
[21:21:01] <someprimetime> bung: on the first one if i vote up and then vote down it should bring it to 0
[21:21:12] <bung> so close
[21:21:13] <someprimetime> otherwise the others seem to
[21:21:14] <dblosevn> bung: you finally got it right
[21:21:28] <dblosevn> on second though nope lmao
[21:21:28] <bung> practice makes perfect
[21:22:26] <someprimetime> bung++
[21:22:36] <bung> getting there
[21:23:43] <dblosevn> alright leaving for real this time
[21:23:47] <dblosevn> bbl
[21:24:29] <someprimetime> later
[21:27:31] <bung> wait a minute
[21:28:13] <bung> you know that behaviour doesnt really make sense compared to the rest of them
[21:28:22] <bung> in all other cases, down means down from "was"
[21:28:28] <bung> in that case its "return to zero"
[21:28:42] <gnarf> bung: its because its "uncheck up"
[21:28:52] <bung> uncheck up only if it was at zero
[21:28:59] <gnarf> then a failed "check down" because it is 0
[21:29:01] <bung> why even have the down button
[21:29:03] <bung> honestly
[21:29:20] <bung> if you cant go below zero, then there should be no down button on something on fresh page load of 0
[21:29:29] <bung> but fine ill code it, CHALLENGE ACCEPTED
[21:30:10] <someprimetime> lol
[21:32:44] <bung> so in this silly edge case
[21:32:48] <bung> does the down get the active class?
[21:33:00] <someprimetime> it should
[21:33:13] <someprimetime> because the user voted down on it so their vote still gets counted
[21:33:23] <bung> they didnt though?
[21:33:34] <bung> it starts at 0, the click up so its 1, then click down so its back to zero
[21:33:41] <gnarf> they un-voted up
[21:34:00] <bung> gnarf: that is not the same as voting down dude
[21:34:19] <gnarf> correct
[21:34:51] <bung> which is why i asked about giving down the active class in that state
[21:34:55] <someprimetime> this is the best example i can give in the wild: http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/12u0m4/if_you_like_to_hide_special_files_on_your_computer/
[21:34:56] <bung> but what baby wants, baby gets
[21:34:59] <someprimetime> if you vote down on that
[21:35:27] <someprimetime> damn almost @ 300k subscribers
[21:35:28] <someprimetime> baus
[21:35:36] <gnarf> bung: I handled it in http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/mfmK3/8/
[21:35:45] <bung> trust me, having not lower than zero is different :)
[21:35:48] <gnarf> bung: you'll notice that you don't actually vote down, you just unvote up
[21:36:00] <gnarf> agree - if you can vote down, negative is usual
[21:36:16] <bung> gnarf: i saw your code but its too long for my taste
[21:36:29] <bung> someprimetime: try this one now plz: http://jsfiddle.net/eS5ax/2/
[21:36:35] <someprimetime> http://www.moviefancentral.com/images/pictures/review57954/gasp.gif?1350878063
[21:36:45] <gnarf> bung: its tiny and expressive - but whatever :)
[21:36:52] <someprimetime> ok now jsfiddle is being slow
[21:37:03] <bung> its been slow for me on and off tonight, weird
[21:38:23] <bung> i dont know what expressive means, but i think mine is tiny too
[21:38:53] <someprimetime> bung: http://jsfiddle.net/eS5ax/3/ now it does
[21:39:16] <someprimetime> "i dont know what expressive means, but i think mine is tiny too" <--- new chat topic
[21:39:17] <bung> now what does
[21:39:48] <someprimetime> just added the active class since in /2/ if you vote down on the first one right when going to the page, it should add the class
[21:40:01] <bung> ok if you say so
[21:40:08] <someprimetime> but yours is pretty hot
[21:40:13] <bung> thank you
[21:40:19] <gnarf> expressive meaning the code practically reads itself outloud
[21:40:23] <someprimetime> who's going to write it in coffeescript now?
[21:40:26] <bung> it got more messy because of that edge case
[21:40:34] <gnarf> your's is also expressive bung
[21:40:48] <gnarf> but also pretty tiny
[21:41:24] <gnarf> but to be fair, its practically my solution just bound on all buttons instead of encapsulating the logic for each "widget" separately it doesn't take advantage of caching any of the selections either
[21:41:54] <bung> yes i took it out, i like my code lines to start on the thing im doing something on
[21:42:08] <bung> if he needs more specificity he can give his buttons a class
[21:42:15] <someprimetime> http://i.imgur.com/OphwV.png
[21:42:15] <gnarf> bung: I approached it as "for each vote-container, wire up buttons"
[21:42:17] <bung> or nest them in something
[21:42:29] <gnarf> that is still "operating" on things :)
[21:43:00] <bung> and of course its practically your solution, because it meets the same requirements
[21:43:09] <bung> like i said at the start, i thought it was a cool problem and wanted to have a go
[21:44:20] <bung> and my final feedback, is that if something starts at zero, and things cant go negative, no need to have a down button
[21:44:45] <bung> just check or uncheck up
[21:44:57] <bung> which also makes that code simpler back to the first version
[21:46:52] <gnarf> http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/mfmK3/10/ = 355 minified -- http://jsfiddle.net/eS5ax/3/ = 440 minified
[21:47:36] <gnarf> yours is 244 .min.gz, mine is 222 -- either way tiny ;)
[21:48:06] <gnarf> i removed the extra stuff mine was doing ( recording the final state and ajaxing ) to make it fair
[21:48:54] <bung> heres what i mean about that "no 0 downbutton" http://jsfiddle.net/eS5ax/5/
[21:49:14] <dblosevn> lol is bung still workin on that?
[21:49:28] <bung> dblosevn: never do anything for fun?
[21:49:36] <CapMax> javascript event for click on a text field?
[21:49:38] <dblosevn> just messin
[21:49:38] <CapMax> jquery*
[21:49:47] <CapMax> i tried click() and select() with no avail
[21:49:48] <dblosevn> mcdonalds is taking forever so i jumped on there wireless
[21:49:49] <bung> CapMax: .focus?
[21:49:56] <gnarf> bung: I'm pretty sure we've all been working on it "for fun" for like the last 30 minutes - thats why I did it in the first place :)
[21:50:01] <dblosevn> bad when you have time to grab a laptop in the damn drive thru
[21:50:11] <CapMax> bung: brilliant thanks
[21:50:15] <dblosevn> ^^ me too
[21:50:56] <dblosevn> my average wait time at this store has been 12-18 minutes this time of night in the drive thru
[21:51:01] <someprimetime> bung: good point but the layout would look weird without that button on the list view
[21:51:12] <bung> if you say so :)
[21:51:22] <someprimetime> what mcdonalds are you at
[21:51:24] <dblosevn> seriously the chick in fornt of me just got out of her car and walked away ....
[21:51:27] <someprimetime> so i can avoid it
[21:51:28] <bung> i also forgot to remove that return false line, w/e
[21:51:39] <someprimetime> wtf she left her car there?
[21:51:45] <dblosevn> ya
[21:51:46] <someprimetime> bung++ nice job
[21:51:52] <dblosevn> thats how long she been here
[21:51:56] <CapMax> how about changing the option of a set of radio buttons? im doing $('input[name="amount_type"]').val('other');
[21:51:58] <someprimetime> dblosevn: go sit in it and wait for her to come back
[21:52:05] <someprimetime> then you can both share your meal together
[21:52:07] <dblosevn> she is kinda hot lol
[21:52:08] <someprimetime> that's how romance starts
[21:52:15] <dblosevn> her car is super fly though
[21:52:17] <bung> CapMax: is there a change?
[21:52:23] <bung> .change() ?
[21:52:23] <dblosevn> lime green challenger
[21:52:34] <bung> CapMax: i think a quick google would answer that
[21:52:35] <dblosevn> id prolly be arrested
[21:52:48] <CapMax> bung: trying
[21:53:03] <bung> probly $('#radioSet').change() or something
[21:53:11] <bung> wife calls, bbl
[21:55:00] <someprimetime> what is everyone's opinion on the single var declaration?
[21:57:13] <aqeel> fission6 u there
[22:00:44] <coldhead> i don't care for it, someprimetime
[22:00:58] <coldhead> only takes one ; in place of a , and everything is ruined
[22:01:24] <someprimetime> yeah same here i was doing it for like a week and now i'm going back and adding in var prefixes since i kept having to change commas and semicolons when i'd move declarations up or down
[22:01:27] <coldhead> someprimetime: food for thought http://benalman.com/news/2012/05/multiple-var-statements-javascript/
[22:02:44] <someprimetime> lol
[22:02:52] <someprimetime> i love the PROBLEM SOLVED comments
[22:02:59] <bubu> that decreases readability and maintenance imo
[22:03:19] <bubu> maintainability*
[22:03:36] <coldhead> i suggested the "SIMPLE AND SEXY" comment
[22:03:39] <coldhead> go me
[22:04:09] <dblosevn> go me :-D
[22:06:53] <bubu> i never even considered this while coding in JavaScript
[22:07:43] <bubu> i go for readability ;P
[22:08:29] <gnarf> someprimetime: If you are using multiple `var` they should all be declared at the top
[22:08:32] <coldhead> that's the most important thing, bubu
[22:08:35] <coldhead> keep doing that
[22:08:45] <someprimetime> gnarf: +1
[22:08:57] <coldhead> ooh i'm gonna disagree with you folks
[22:09:07] <coldhead> i like to declare as close as possible to usage
[22:09:13] <gnarf> someprimetime: I use the ,\n\t version because thats jQuery core style
[22:09:20] <coldhead> reduce the cognitive load
[22:09:24] <someprimetime> \n\t?
[22:09:27] <someprimetime> oh newline?
[22:09:27] <gnarf> coldhead: vars and functions at the top
[22:09:35] <coldhead> not in my school gnarf
[22:09:36] <someprimetime> ahh gotcha
[22:09:45] <gnarf> comma newline tab as oppsed semi newline "var "
[22:09:45] <coldhead> you're off the coldQuery team gnarf
[22:09:48] <someprimetime> coldheadmaster
[22:10:02] <coldhead> hand in your commit rights
[22:10:14] <someprimetime> git checkout .
[22:10:28] <bubu> i agree with coldhead
[22:10:48] <someprimetime> coldhead: what about the hoisting issue though?
[22:11:04] <someprimetime> i mean that's the only reason i declare at the top, but i've never personally run into a hoisting issue
[22:11:10] <someprimetime> i've just read it's best practice because of that
[22:11:11] <gnarf> coldhead: jshint onevar: true, latedef: false
[22:11:50] <gnarf> er sorry
[22:11:53] <gnarf> latedef: true
[22:12:36] <gnarf> I actually don't mind onevar being false
[22:12:37] <coldhead> yeah i totally jshint all my code
[22:12:43] <gnarf> but latedef: true is important imo
[22:13:15] <coldhead> someprimetime: i think it's better to know about hoisting in case you ever see weirdness and debug it, rather than having it force you to layout your code weirdly
[22:13:31] <someprimetime> coldhead: fair enough
[22:14:09] <coldhead> when someone is reading my code i prefer they don't have to start out going "oh so there's an i, and a j and a k, i guess they are counters, that i don't even need to know about know, and there's a couple of temp vars and uh something called kim_gordons_panties"
[22:14:21] <coldhead> that is not a good start to a readable function for me
[22:15:05] <bubu> declaring a var outside of the for loop statement is NOOBISH
[22:15:16] <gnarf> coldhead: if you have to many variables that don't have immediately recognizable purpose seems like smell more than listing them all at the top
[22:16:23] <coldhead> we can disagree on this, gnarf. you can do it your weird way and continue contributing to the most popular JS lib in the world, i will write my sane sensible code that no one will ever read or execute
[22:16:57] <coldhead> in fact maybe i'll get into landscape gardening
[22:17:03] <gnarf> coldhead: http://coldhead.github.com/kaleidos/?src=http://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt71/Pittsburghistan/xb9yt0jpg-1.gif
[22:17:05] <gnarf> :)
[22:17:41] <coldhead> hahahaha
[22:17:45] <someprimetime> omg this is amazing
[22:18:14] <coldhead> lol all that code is declare vars at use
[22:18:19] <coldhead> I AM THE WORST JQUERY IN THE WORLD
[22:18:26] <gnarf> it's sooo ugly
[22:18:32] <gnarf> :P
[22:19:10] <coldhead> it smells like my mother
[22:19:15] <coldhead> she's incontinent
[22:19:25] <coldhead> BUT STILL SO LOVEABLE AMIRITE
[22:20:58] <bubu> coldhead: you working on a personal project?
[22:21:13] <coldhead> that's a very personal question
[22:21:25] <coldhead> no, right now i am trying to look busy for 20 more minutes then i am going home
[22:22:07] <bubu> are you in europe?
[22:22:09] <bubu> wtf
[22:22:28] <coldhead> AUSTRALIA, MATE
[22:22:28] <bubu> wait, that was a dumb question
[22:22:29] <coldhead> CRIKEY
[22:22:50] <gnarf> yeah coldhead goes home at 7am :)
[22:23:06] <bubu> lol yeah for some reason i cant do math
[22:23:26] <coldhead> math is hard
[22:23:31] <coldhead> like most things
[22:23:36] <gnarf> ?ts
[22:23:37] <bot-t> That's Sexual™
[22:23:38] <coldhead> it's no shame
[22:28:46] <Lost123> hi http://jsfiddle.net/4DX5B/ why onchange doesn't work here?
[22:29:51] <coldhead> Lost123: http://jsfiddle.net/4DX5B/1/
[22:29:55] <coldhead> don't use onchange
[22:30:03] <coldhead> those days are gone
[22:30:10] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[22:31:07] <Lost123> coldhead: still doesn't work
[22:31:16] <coldhead> works for me
[22:31:31] <beachandbytes> http://jsfiddle.net/4DX5B/2/
[22:31:31] <Lost123> do you get an alert?
[22:32:08] <beachandbytes> as always coldhead is correct
[22:32:46] <tw2113> as always? he's a new guy
[22:33:03] <tw2113> you talk about him like he's been around awhile *shifty eyes*
[22:33:08] <Lost123> $('.goog-te-combo').change doesn't work, right?
[22:33:13] <coldhead> Lost123: i see what you mean
[22:33:15] <coldhead> $('.goog-te-combo')
[22:33:26] <coldhead> that needs to be .live() or .on() delegated
[22:33:37] <coldhead> because it's not present when the code first runs
[22:33:42] <coldhead> http://jsfiddle.net/4DX5B/3/
[22:34:01] <bubu> i use onchange... $().on("change")
[22:40:46] <Lost123> why do we use .live here, i dont get it
[22:40:53] <Lost123> it works thanks beachandbytes  and coldhead
[22:42:08] <beachandbytes> dont use live
[22:42:11] <beachandbytes> use .on
[22:42:34] <Indunil> hi
[22:42:41] <Indunil> guys its indunil
[22:43:16] <astropirate> Indunil, can I have your autograph?
[22:43:32] <Indunil> have any body using malsup's jquery.form.js lately
[22:43:57] <gnarf> Lost123: $( selector ).live( "change", fn ) is the same as $( document ).on( "change", selector, fn ) --- you should use the second form, .live() is deprecated see ?live
[22:43:58] <bot-t> Lost123, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[22:44:00] <coldhead> he's not ready for on(), beachandbytes
[22:44:33] <coldhead> .live(): for when you just want people to get their shit working and get out of your face
[22:44:51] <Indunil> the problem is that jquery.form.js it gives a error in submit in IE9 Access Denide
[22:46:40] <Indunil> can anybody know the issue here or a fix for it IE9 Access Denide  for jquery.form.js submit
[22:48:24] <Indunil> hey any body
[22:48:41] <Iperamuna> can anybody know the issue here or a fix for it IE9 Access Denide  for jquery.form.js submit
[22:58:16] <bubu> seems like a pretty impatient guy
[23:00:47] <astropirate> bubu, i like your name
[23:02:53] <bubu> awww shucks
[23:05:20] <tab1293> im trying to use the ajax method to make a post request but whenever the ajax call is run the success function isnt called back. what happens is the action succeeds but instead of calling the succed function the serialized from is just added to the url of my current page
[23:05:28] <tab1293> anyone know why this may be happening
[23:05:56] <astropirate> tab1293, can we see the c0de please?
[23:06:05] <tab1293> astropirate: yeah hold on
[23:07:10] <tab1293> astropirate: http://pastebin.com/ma8X2FeH
[23:07:14] <tab1293> the php is included as well
[23:07:36] <tab1293> but the script is working fine cause everything is added to the db
[23:08:39] <tab1293> and then the page reloads with this url http://localhost/private/register.php?userName=test&password=test&reTypePassword=test&email=test%40email.com
[23:08:50] <tab1293> like its making a get request to itself
[23:09:09] <bubu> try using the submit handler and not the click?
[23:09:26] <bubu> i think it's because your action is blank in the form
[23:09:52] <bubu> try this: $('#submit').submit(function()
[23:10:07] <tab1293> bubu ok let me see if that works
[23:10:13] <bubu> wait
[23:10:41] <bubu> i mean this: $('#register').submit(function()
[23:11:27] <tab1293> bubu: doesnt make a difference same thing happens
[23:12:01] <bubu> even with the correction?
[23:12:16] <bubu> you bind the submit to the form, not the submit button
[23:13:49] <krz> shouldn't this traverse through each element?     $.each('nav.pagination span.page', function(key) { alert(key); });
[23:14:03] <krz> $('nav.pagination span.page').length returns 2
[23:14:14] <krz> but alert is alerting 12 times
[23:19:25] <krz> anyone?1
[23:20:51] <tab1293> bubu: $('#register').submit(function()  is what i have
[23:20:54] <tab1293> not working
[23:21:57] <bubu> ok last thing: try putting a "return false;" as the last line of the submit handler
[23:24:20] <tw2113> ?preventDefault @ everyone
[23:24:21] <bot-t> everyone, event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[23:24:37] <tw2113> ?preventDefault > everyone
[23:24:40] <bot-t> tw2113, .trigger() - Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[23:24:44] <tw2113> come on bot!
[23:25:13] <tw2113> ha, there we go
[23:26:12] <tab1293> bubu nope doesnt change it. I see nothing wrong with this code though. could it be something wrong with the serialization
[23:26:17] <tab1293> ?
[23:32:59] <djsounds02> hey guys
[23:33:10] <djsounds02> in my theme folder in a js file I have this..      this.fileLoadingImage = '/../images/loading.gif';  How do I direct that properly?
[23:33:32] <bubu> tab1293: maybe try serializeArray
[23:35:29] <bubu> tab1293: open up the browser's network traffic monitor (under dev tools) and make sure the request looks good
[23:48:40] <tab1293> bubu: http://localhost/private/register.php?userName=test&password=test&reTypePassword=test&email=test%40email.com
[23:51:20] <chovy> how come this doesn't replace both .foo elements? http://jsfiddle.net/chovy/mWJfj/
[23:52:11] <tab1293> it should have actions in the url and it shouldnt be a get request
[23:52:35] <tab1293> its doing the two exact opposite things im telling it to do
[23:59:52] <hemangpatel> How to calculate intersection of two rectangle ?
