[00:00:27] <hellyeah> Max-P:  if you are available i have one more question
[00:00:39] <Max-P> !ask
[00:01:38] <Max-P> ... oh, that doesn't exist here. Anyway, go ahead, don't ask to ask, just ask. If someone is around to answer, then they'll answer. And if I happen to still be there then I will probably answer too
[00:01:48] <Cork> Max-P: it does
[00:01:51] <Cork> the bot is just dead
[00:01:57] <Cork> it is most of the time now days
[00:02:01] <hellyeah> what
[00:02:06] <hellyeah> what it doesnt exist
[00:02:34] <hellyeah> i must have effect on second window like in first modal window why i dont have effect http://jsfiddle.net/cmhmb34j/6/
[00:02:54] <Max-P> hellyeah: "!help" is a command that usually trigger a bot in the channel to say something that's frequently repeated, such as the "Don't ask to ask, just ask"
[00:03:08] <hellyeah> !help
[00:03:10] <Max-P> But as Cork said, the bot is dead so it didn't work.
[00:03:14] <hellyeah> :D
[00:03:37] <hellyeah> bot is sometimes dead also in javascript
[00:03:42] <hellyeah> or in #english
[00:03:51] <hellyeah> i never saw bot is dead in #music
[00:04:10] <Max-P> Yeah each chan usually have their own
[00:05:07] <hellyeah> yes
[00:05:12] <Cork> they must have, the system doesn't provide anything other then channel management bots
[00:05:33] <hellyeah> any ideas why effect doesnt work?
[00:07:00] <ocmnt> anyone knows wether there is a tinymce channel? :D
[00:07:11] <Cork> google?
[00:07:19] <ocmnt> google says no
[00:07:52] <ocmnt> there is this annoying bug in tinymce and firefox that gives no line-breaks on raw content :( was hoping someone somewhere could help out in a solution, google has none
[00:07:58] <hellyeah> ocmt
[00:08:01] <hellyeah> #freenode
[00:08:06] <hellyeah> and ask for suitable command
[00:08:16] <hellyeah> command begin with /list
[00:08:23] <hellyeah> you have to filter it somehow
[00:08:24] <ocmnt> ah thnx hellyeah :_)
[00:08:26] <ocmnt> :)
[00:08:37] <logan0405> Hi I'm making a small chrome extension to hide the cursor on netflix movies. I used document ready event to call the code. It works, but only until it autoplays the next episode. I assume it changes my code w/o refreshing the page/changing the URL. Any way around this?
[00:08:42] <hellyeah> i dont remember exactly but in #freenode they will tell you
[00:09:37] <Max-P> logan0405: You probably can put it into a timer every X seconds. They probably replace the content via AJAX so yeah your changes gets overwritten when it changes
[00:09:56] <Cork> icedp: from a quick google it doesn't look like they use irc
[00:09:59] <Cork> opps
[00:10:01] <Cork> *ocmnt:
[00:10:02] <logan0405> ok
[00:10:04] <hellyeah> any help?
[00:10:22] <logan0405> Max-P, if I put it in a timer wouldn't it get overwritten too?
[00:10:24] <Cork> ocmnt: they use a forum instead
[00:10:44] <hellyeah> okey
[00:10:46] <hellyeah> fixed that
[00:10:59] <hellyeah> i always am confused about class "." and id "#"
[00:11:02] <hellyeah> always confused
[00:11:05] <hellyeah> i di
[00:11:12] <hellyeah> i didnt memorize it
[00:11:14] <hellyeah> damn
[00:15:16] <ocmnt> Cork, thnx for that. Noticed the forum but it seems this issue of mine has bene around since 2012 or something without any assignment (not even in bugfixing from github)
[00:25:32] <hellyeah> hey
[00:26:48] <hellyeah> when i open second modal window first modal window goes down or secand modal window behave weirdly can you take a look just try to open second modal window and close both try again you will see what i am talking about  http://jsfiddle.net/cmhmb34j/8/
[00:47:49] <lozadaOmr> Is it possible to trigger a form multipart/form-data which has an input-file using $('#myForm').submit()
[00:48:05] <lozadaOmr> been trying to do it, but I get a error 400
[00:48:09] <Xatenev> lozadaOmr: sounds weird, why cant u just make the form multipart form data?
[00:48:11] <Cork> lozadaOmr: sure
[00:48:16] <Xatenev> ah
[00:48:17] <Xatenev> nevermind
[00:48:19] <Xatenev> now i understood u :p
[00:48:33] <Cork> lozadaOmr: how you trigger the submit doesn't matter
[00:48:46] <Cork> you can't add files to the form by script though
[00:49:11] <lozadaOmr> the endpoint is working on its own, but when I try to trigger the form submit (on a modal's click event) it doesn't work
[00:49:34] <lozadaOmr> BTW, I was referring to Bootstrap 3 Modal.
[00:53:59] <lozadaOmr> Cork even I'm just using a different button to trigger the form's submit?
[00:54:19] <Cork> like i said, how you trigger the submit doesn't matter
[02:26:32] <Herehere> hi, im using this angular plugin http://leandropio.github.io/ng-fi-text/
[02:26:45] <Herehere> which fit text to div
[02:27:14] <Herehere> I'm trying to change font for words with less than 6 letters
[02:27:31] <Herehere> var size1 = $('.mydiv').text().length;
[02:27:31] <Herehere>         if (size1 < 6){
[02:27:31] <Herehere>                 alert(size+", "+ size1)
[02:27:31] <Herehere>         }
[02:27:57] <Herehere> but it doesnt dynamically show font-size
[02:28:16] <arc_> plz don't paste code into the channel
[02:28:31] <Herehere> dude its only 4 lines
[02:28:38] <arc_> not my rule
[02:28:49] <Herehere> ok then, sorry
[02:30:26] <arc_> what do you mean it doesn't dynamically show font-size
[02:30:54] <Herehere> I want it to alert me current font size of word
[02:31:07] <Herehere> aaa damn it
[02:31:09] <arc_> where is size defined
[02:31:18] <Herehere> how long is word
[02:31:22] <Herehere> not font size
[02:31:36] <arc_> that's what size1 is
[02:31:41] <Herehere> yes
[02:31:46] <arc_> so where is size defined
[02:31:59] <Herehere> what length is
[02:32:08] <Herehere> this function shows me what length is
[02:32:28] <Xatenev> Herehere: what do you want to achieve?
[02:32:48] <Herehere> Ok maybe I start at the beginning
[02:32:49] <arc_> you said you want it to alert you of the font size. the variable size that you are referencing in your alert
[02:32:52] <Xatenev> maybe
[02:32:53] <arc_> we don't know what it is
[02:33:16] <Herehere> I have a text which dynamically generated
[02:33:32] <Herehere> i use my jquery function to show length of current word
[02:33:41] <Herehere> but it shows '0'
[02:34:12] <Herehere> thats because when my page is reloaded I have no text
[02:34:31] <Herehere> after 5 seconds some text are generated
[02:34:49] <Xatenev> so add it in the callback of the function which generates the text
[02:35:08] <Xatenev> so you execute the jquery function just when the text is generated
[02:35:46] <Herehere> well I can't. I cannot do anything with function which causing texts being generated
[02:36:05] <Herehere> I cannot intefere
[02:36:38] <arc_> why?
[02:36:50] <Herehere> dont ask me lol
[02:36:55] <Herehere> ask my boss
[02:37:17] <Herehere> so is it possible to to this in jquery?
[02:37:21] <Xatenev> Herehere: give me his email
[02:37:21] <Xatenev> :p
[02:37:42] <Xatenev> Herehere: maybe jqueries .bind() can help here
[02:38:17] <Xatenev> so u trigger an event when the DIV is changed
[02:38:30] <Xatenev> and inside the eventhandler u execute ur functio
[02:38:30] <Xatenev> n
[02:38:45] <Xatenev> but you should really find where the manipulation occurs and then add whatever u need there
[02:39:16] <Herehere> what If I tell you that this function is cause by angular?
[02:39:31] <Herehere> by the way im noob in angular and jquery ;P
[02:39:42] <Herehere> in jquery i can do only simple things
[02:39:44] <Xatenev> I thought ur boss says u cannt interfere?
[02:39:52] <Xatenev> now its angular?
[02:40:07] <Herehere> function which is caused text being generated is written in angular
[02:40:15] <Xatenev> Im sure there is some kind of callback
[02:40:24] <Xatenev> inside angulars function ( I don't know about angular so i have no idea)
[02:40:24] <Herehere> because it get text from API
[02:40:48] <arc_> what about addEventListener waiting for the function that adds the content to fire
[02:41:21] <arc_> i use that in userscripts because i can't modify the site's code
[02:41:47] <Xatenev> what aboug ng-change anyways?
[02:41:58] <Xatenev> ng-change on the div - when the content is changed, do something cool
[02:42:06] <Herehere> well I think instead of finding solution in jquery I should read angular documentation
[02:42:12] <Xatenev> Herehere: yes.
[02:42:19] <Xatenev> but I think ng-change is ur solution anyways
[02:43:29] <Herehere> Thank you guys for your time
[02:47:37] <neanderslob> hi all; I have an event that triggers a div class change that (among other things) makes a div grow from md-column(6) to md-column(12); is there a way to animate this size change?

[05:07:53] <arup_r> How to get the value of an attributes inside the <option> tag ? I tried https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/17c14a523dcd4c38d001 not working
[05:21:42] <Cork> arup_r: what are you trying to do?
[05:22:43] <arup_r> I figured it out
[05:22:59] <arup_r> Ok.. I mean the error I figured out
[05:23:26] <arup_r> my goal is to hide the options for which `data-stat` is some value .. Is it possible ?
[05:23:38] <Cork> aure
[05:23:46] <Cork> is data-stat set through .data?
[05:23:57] <Cork> or is it a physical attribute on the element
[05:24:10] <Cork> aure==sure
[05:24:10] <arup_r> physical attribute
[05:24:27] <arup_r> let me show you my current code
[05:25:08] <Cork> $('#user_country option').filter('[data-stat="something"]').remove()
[05:25:18] <Cork> is one option
[05:25:56] <Cork> another is $('#user_country option').filter(function(elm) { return $(elm).data('stat') == 'something'; }).remove()
[05:26:29] <Cork> if 'something' is a variable i prefer the later, as concating values into the selector can be fiddly
[05:26:59] <Cork> arup_r: the reason i use .remove() and not something like .css('display', 'none') or .hide()
[05:27:12] <Cork> is because it isn't supported in all browsers
[05:27:31] <Cork> the only way to hide an option element in webkit is to remove the child element
[05:29:03] <arup_r> Cork: I want to hide all the filtered ones https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/17c14a523dcd4c38d001
[05:29:31] <Cork> arup_r: you need to remove them
[05:29:34] <Cork> like i just said
[05:29:38] <arup_r> ok
[05:29:41] <arup_r> let me try
[05:30:16] <Cork> arup_r: btw you can replace value with this in the filter function
[05:30:24] <Cork> (no need for the arguments at all)
[05:30:40] <arup_r> didn't get you
[05:30:46] <notchris> Good morning
[05:30:59] <taplar> morning someone other than chris
[05:31:00] <Cork> arup_r: .filter(function() { return $(this).data() })
[05:31:06] <notchris> taplar: ;)
[05:31:08] <Cork> arup_r: also you need the return in the loop
[05:31:09] <taplar> :)
[05:31:14] <Cork> or nothing will happen
[05:31:36] <notchris> I have a form used for donations on our site
[05:31:37] <notchris> https://www.ctsciencecenter.org/membership-test/
[05:31:44] <notchris> How can I distringuish between the form parts
[05:31:48] <notchris> As there are no URL changes
[05:31:53] <arup_r> nothing happened https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/17c14a523dcd4c38d001 Cork :/
[05:32:05] <Cork> ...
[05:32:11] <Cork> arup_r: read the responses you get...
[05:32:13] <taplar> notchris: "page not found"
[05:32:17] <arup_r> reading
[05:32:24] <notchris> Ah I’m sorry, let me change privacy
[05:32:39] <notchris> taplar: https://ctsciencecenter.thankyou4caring.org/pages/membership-form-copy
[05:33:00] <notchris> The form changes, I want to inject text at the top depending on the form part
[05:33:07] <notchris> However, the URL does not directly change
[05:33:36] <notchris> There are 3 parts to the form
[05:33:57] <taplar> notchris: the easiest way from just a glance would be to do so on the page transition of the next/previous
[05:34:06] <notchris> Right
[05:34:29] <notchris> So I would use onclick via the buttom
[05:34:34] <notchris> However, there are next and previous
[05:34:37] <notchris> On the middle form part
[05:35:26] <taplar> notchris: what are you reffering to as the middle?
[05:37:39] <arup_r> Cork: On first select it is working.. https://gist.github.com/aruprakshit/17c14a523dcd4c38d001 but laster when the first field I am changing the inner select list not showing anything
[05:39:11] <arup_r> *later
[05:39:20] <notchris> taplar: The second part
[05:39:25] <notchris> After you click the first submit
[05:39:32] <taplar> notchris: gotcha, step 2
[05:39:36] <Cork> arup_r: ya, cause you need to have a backup of the fields
[05:39:36] <vdeep> arup_r can you create a fiddle?
[05:39:41] <Cork> arup_r: as the elemnts are removed
[05:39:44] <Cork> *elements
[05:39:52] <notchris> taplar: :)
[05:40:06] <arup_r> Cork: hide(); will be useful then ?
[05:40:11] <Cork> no
[05:40:20] <taplar> notchris: shouldn't be an issue.  you currently already have some form of handling on the next and previous buttons to know which form piece to go to.  The changing of whatever header text could be added to those same handlers.
[05:40:32] <Cork> arup_r: .hide() is a helper function that basically does .css('display', 'none')
[05:40:39] <someone`> Hello. Maybe now there is someone who have some experience with draggable and droppable :) http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31266783/drop-position-on-a-jquery-draggable-and-droppable
[05:40:43] <arup_r> ok
[05:40:45] <Cork> arup_r: and like i said, webkit doesn't care about display values in a dropdown
[05:40:47] <notchris> taplar: The form is generated by an old system
[05:40:51] <notchris> I cant edit it
[05:40:56] <taplar> ouch
[05:41:05] <slavka`> hey guys, if i have an SPA accessing a set of API's via ajax (also accessed by the mobile apps) ... my plan on security is to have the mobile apps use credentials when calling the API and for ajax calls use CORS, is that sufficient?
[05:41:21] <taplar> notchris: ok, so you say it's a single form?
[05:41:29] <notchris> Yes
[05:42:02] <arup_r> Cork: Can you tell me where to take the backup..? hints
[05:42:07] <taplar> notchris: k, another suggest.  add a data-step to the form starting at 1, next increment, previous decrement.  then in your new handler of the next and previous refer to that field to know how to manipulate the text
[05:42:27] <arup_r> vdeep: If I can't get it done by following suggestions.. I'll try to create a fiddle
[05:42:27] <Cork> arup_r: is the dropdowns value ever updated after the page load?
[05:42:35] <arup_r> yes.. it does
[05:42:45] <arup_r> on page load it has all values
[05:42:53] <Cork> uh
[05:43:08] <Cork> updated as in different ones then was there from the start is added to it
[05:43:17] <Cork> i don't talk about filtering
[05:43:38] <arup_r> later I'll make the `county` field disable .. it will be enable only when state field has value
[05:43:54] <Cork> that doesn't answer the question
[05:44:18] <Cork> is there ever new options added/replaced in the dropdown?
[05:44:52] <notchris> taplar: OK
[05:44:53] <arup_r> well.. on page load there is all options... those options are coming from backend
[05:45:01] <Cork> ...
[05:45:02] <slavka`> anyone?
[05:45:09] <Cork> its a yes no question...
[05:45:35] <arup_r> yes
[05:45:55] <taplar> slavka`: these requests over https?
[05:46:08] <Cork> ok, then where you load in more elements would have to put the same list in a separate variable
[05:46:32] <slavka`> yep
[05:46:37] <Cork> simplest is to do something like setting it in the dropdown and then clone the elements and store the clones in a variable
[05:47:12] <taplar> slavka`: seems ok to me, though i'm not a security guru in the least
[05:47:39] <Cork> slavka`: if you mean bundle the cert in the app and that would be the only credential
[05:47:43] <Cork> then no
[05:47:56] <Cork> it would be fairly easy for someone to extract that cert from the app
[05:48:04] <Cork> if they got there hand on the app
[05:48:24] <Cork> if the cert is something each person gets to get access to the api
[05:48:32] <arup_r> Cork: didn't get you
[05:48:33] <Cork> and the cert would be "personal"
[05:48:37] <Cork> then ya that would work
[05:48:38] <arup_r> cloning
[05:48:44] <Cork> .clone()
[05:50:20] <arup_r> yah. I found .. should I clone before the chnage event ? that's what I am asking.. I found the link https://api.jquery.com/clone/
[05:50:38] <Cork> arup_r: you need to backup the complete set
[05:50:50] <Cork> and that only need to happen when you modify the complete list
[05:51:03] <Cork> (add new/replace old options)
[05:51:21] <Cork> so no, it shouldn't happen in the change event
[05:51:30] <Cork> it would make the live filter very slow
[05:51:39] <arup_r> Understood you want me ttake a backup of `$( '#user_county option' )` right ?
[05:51:53] <Cork> yes, when the options are added
[05:52:11] <Cork> then in the change event clone the backup filter it and replace everything in the dropdown
[05:52:27] <Cork> that is the simplest solution
[05:52:45] <slavka`> Cork, thanks that makes sense...
[05:53:22] <arup_r> ok.. I think I didn't get you..
[05:53:24] <slavka`> in terms of the SPA itself...  and securing ajax calls...
[05:53:26] <arup_r> my bad! :/
[05:53:48] <Cork> arup_r: make a jsfiddle with the dropdowns you are trying to work with
[05:54:00] <Cork> it would make it much easier
[05:54:34] <slavka`> would CORS actually be enouth, is there anything else i can do (without embedding credentials in the app itself) ?
[05:54:52] <Cork> slavka`: cors won't help you at all
[05:55:13] <Cork> slavka`: cors isn't a security feature, in that sense
[05:55:35] <Cork> it is there to help servers tell the browser know it can handle cross domain calls
[05:55:40] <Cork> it is all it is there for
[05:55:43] <slavka`> cork, so what are my options...
[05:56:13] <Cork> slavka`: either a private cert for identification
[05:56:18] <Cork> or a username and password
[05:56:26] <Cork> there really isn't much else you can do
[05:56:34] <Cork> https is a must of course
[05:56:38] <slavka`> but how would i utilize that with a client side app?
[05:56:52] <Cork> the user would have to enter there api credentials
[05:56:54] <arup_r> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/ybj3s10p/
[05:57:00] <Cork> and it would then allow them access to the api
[05:58:18] <slavka`> so... they enter the credentials, and then the app makes a ajax call ... how does the API know that the ajax call is coming from my app (myapp.com) and not some other domain
[05:58:40] <taplar> slavka`: why would it matter, if their credentials are valid?
[05:59:01] <Cork> arup_r: https://jsfiddle.net/ybj3s10p/1/
[05:59:16] <Cork> slavka`: you can't
[05:59:28] <Cork> slavka`: that is why i meant you should identify the PERSON not the app
[05:59:36] <slavka`> i dunno, but it can... say somebody creates a myapp2.com and advertises on some b.s forum... and so customers go and loging through his site...
[05:59:48] <Cork> slavka`: you can only protect an app identification through obfuscation
[05:59:53] <Cork> and that never works
[06:00:16] <Cork> slavka`: you can only identify the app if it actually tells you
[06:00:21] <Cork> something it most likely wouldn't
[06:00:49] <Cork> slavka`: all the server gets is a tcp package
[06:00:56] <Cork> what is in that package is up to the client
[06:01:05] <slavka`> cork, so in the end "you cant" is the final answer
[06:01:17] <Cork> and a simple package sniffer can find if you add something mystic there to identify your app
[06:01:22] <Cork> slavka`: yes
[06:01:37] <Cork> slavka`: you can make it harder, but you can't secure it to just work with your app
[06:01:39] <slavka`> cork... thanks thats what i thought anyway
[06:01:57] <arup_r> Cork: thank you very much!
[06:02:35] <slavka`> cork, going based off that there is no need for sep authentication methods to api (via ajax from SPA or from mobile app) .. as long as both require user to authenticate
[06:02:53] <Cork> slavka`: yes
[06:03:13] <Cork> unless you never let anyone have access to the app as in the binary)
[06:03:34] <Cork> *unless you never let anyone have access to the app (as in the binary)
[06:04:30] <slavka`> cork, thanks again, really appreciate the insight
[06:04:47] <Cork> ya, it is a tricky one to answer :)
[06:05:12] <notchris> How can I instease “data-step” on a button click
[06:05:17] <notchris> And reverse on another click
[06:05:29] <Cork> instease?
[06:05:37] <notchris> increase
[06:05:38] <notchris> Sorry
[06:05:41] <taplar> $(selector).data('step', $(selector).data('step') + 1 );
[06:05:45] <notchris> Ahh
[06:05:58] <taplar> store your selector though for reuse
[06:06:03] <Cork> or $(selector).data().step++
[06:08:33] <notchris> Cork: is that right?
[06:08:48] <Cork> sorry?
[06:09:18] <arup_r> Cork: One more idea I need.. On page load, I don't want to see any value in the county list unless someone is selecting any value from a State..
[06:09:21] <arup_r> how to do so ?
[06:09:24] <notchris> Cork: .step++
[06:09:26] <notchris> Is that a thing?
[06:09:29] <Cork> yes
[06:09:34] <notchris> Hmm
[06:09:45] <Cork> .data() without arguments return the full data object
[06:09:49] <taplar> ++ and -- increment and decrement if your not familiar
[06:09:51] <Cork> where 'step' is just a key
[06:10:17] <arup_r> After clone? or before ?
[06:10:33] <notchris> I realize that
[06:10:38] <notchris> Didn’t increase the step however
[06:10:39] <notchris> hmm
[06:10:40] <Cork> basically what .data does is that it has an object inside jquery this object has a key that represents the element
[06:10:54] <notchris> I use data
[06:11:05] <notchris> But I’m not familiar with .step
[06:12:15] <arup_r> Cork: ?
[06:12:22] <Cork> notchris: http://jsfiddle.net/m3dd4t34/
[06:12:52] <Cork> arup_r: detatch() instead of clone
[06:13:18] <arup_r> in the existing fiddle >
[06:13:26] <notchris> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/populartruth/t8j3q4j8/
[06:13:30] <notchris> Is what I came up with
[06:14:57] <Cork> notchris: ya, works fine
[06:15:35] <notchris> Not working for me hmm
[06:17:54] <BigDX> hi
[06:18:45] <BigDX> how can i slow down my JS? it seems faster then light ^^
[06:19:08] <oddvar> this is a good thing :D
[06:19:46] <notchris> Oh man
[06:19:50] <notchris> The page refreshes
[06:19:50] <arup_r> Cork: thanks worked https://jsfiddle.net/ybj3s10p/3/
[06:19:57] <notchris> I think I need to do url paramter
[06:20:28] <Cork> notchris: try event.preventDefault() in the click handler
[06:20:35] <hellyeah> anyone awake?
[06:20:36] <Cork> (you are abusing a link after all)
[06:20:39] <Cork> hellyeah: no
[06:20:44] <Cork> we're all sleepwalking
[06:21:08] <BigDX> naa ... not really ^^ if I removeClass from an element, just added/moved with appendTo(), the class is already gone when the actual element is added making the css-transitions fail
[06:21:22] <BigDX> *removeClass()
[06:21:25] <hellyeah> check line 97 how can i add second animation to my button i want to button animate to blue then red
[06:21:28] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/js2wrydd/3/
[06:21:45] <Cork> BigDX: you have to reflow the page for css transition to work
[06:21:54] <Cork> BigDX: what you are seeing is by design
[06:22:11] <Cork> BigDX: it is simple to get around $(elm).width() before you remove the class
[06:22:17] <BigDX> can you please explain what u mean with reflow?
[06:22:29] <Cork> BigDX: the browser has to actually draw the elements
[06:22:41] <Cork> the browser freezes while js runs
[06:22:47] <Cork> so it doesn't "see" the class
[06:22:53] <Cork> as it gets removed before it looks for it
[06:23:10] <Cork> .width() triggers a reflow
[06:23:11] <hellyeah> any help i appreciate
[06:23:13] <Cork> so the browser sees it
[06:24:03] <BigDX> ahh ok, so width() on the added element for example will do the trick?
[06:24:08] <Cork> yes
[06:24:09] <BigDX> or on any element
[06:24:22] <BigDX> thanks!
[06:24:27] <Cork> well any element as long as it causes the browser to look at the element needed
[06:24:40] <Cork> so ya, the element you want to do .removeClass on is normally best
[06:25:30] <BigDX> what functions do force a reflow?
[06:25:50] <BigDX> so i can probaly use one thats makes somehow sense ^^
[06:25:58] <Cork> anything that causes the browser to calculate the elements dimentions
[06:26:13] <notchris> Cork: If you click next
[06:26:13] <notchris> https://ctsciencecenter.thankyou4caring.org/pages/membership-form-copy
[06:26:18] <notchris> The data step goes up
[06:26:23] <notchris> But on page load, it goes back to 1
[06:26:33] <Cork> notchris: ya, cause the value is stored in the dom
[06:26:36] <BigDX> ah ok, thats why "addClass" didnt work
[06:26:38] <Cork> on page load the dom is replaced
[06:26:43] <Cork> BigDX: exactly
[06:26:46] <notchris> Cork: Where do I need to store it
[06:27:03] <notchris> as url paramter?
[06:27:11] <BigDX> but good to know that i was on the right track ... more or less
[06:27:24] <Cork> notchris: the query string, localstorage, sessionstorage, cookie, server side, indexeddb
[06:27:30] <Cork> it is all up to how you want to store it
[06:29:09] <hellyeah> Cork:
[06:29:13] <hellyeah> any help for me?
[06:32:11] <prohobo> is there ANY reason to use attr over prop?
[06:32:18] <prohobo> or can i just go like "i dunno" and use prop
[06:33:19] <NoiseEee> for tag attributes?
[06:34:33] <NoiseEee> 'prop' is generally for setting things as true/false
[06:34:54] <NoiseEee> well not strictly i guess
[06:35:20] <hellyeah> how can i add two animatrions to button it will be blue then red http://jsfiddle.net/js2wrydd/4/
[06:36:12] <hellyeah> i mean it will be red then blue
[06:37:54] <notchris> sigh
[06:37:59] <notchris> I cant get localstore working
[06:38:06] <notchris> I just want to increment a locally stored value
[06:38:11] <notchris> On a click function
[06:38:25] <notchris> I did this outside of the click function: localStorage.setItem('page', 0);
[06:38:59] <hep_> Having some weird trouble. I can't read a basic JS object for some reason! :( http://codepen.io/anon/pen/pJLVrO?editors=101
[06:38:59] <notchris> then inside click function
[06:39:01] <notchris> localStorage.getItem('page') + 1;
[06:39:26] <Cork> notchris: you can't do math with localStorage
[06:39:38] <Cork> you have to take the string you get parse it to number change the number
[06:39:44] <Cork> and then store the new number back in again
[06:39:48] <notchris> Sigh
[06:39:50] <Cork> (every thing in localstorage is strings)
[06:40:15] <notchris> parseInt(localStorage.getItem('page')) + 1;
[06:40:16] <notchris> ?
[06:40:42] <hep_> It's driving me crazy!
[06:45:39] <Cork> hep_: data isn't json, so JSON.parse won't work
[06:46:12] <hep_> Cork: OK Good point.
[06:47:34] <hep_> Cork: I still dont get any output though
[06:48:02] <hep_> Cork: In my actual app data is JSON and not just an object.
[06:48:05] <Cork> hep_: ya, cause json isn't defined now
[06:48:34] <Cork> hep_: then you need to make the demo more like the live example
[06:48:51] <Cork> hep_: btw is the answer coming over ajax?
[06:49:17] <Cork> (you should fix the server instead of hacking around it with JSON.parse)
[06:49:22] <hep_> Yes. Data comes from a solr instance.
[06:49:52] <Cork> cause if the server doesn't lie about what data it sends it should be an object and not a string
[06:50:36] <hep_> Cork: The server does send back a JSON string.
[06:50:45] <Cork> it sends back a string
[06:50:50] <Cork> but it isn't sending json
[06:51:02] <Cork> meaning Content-Type isn't application/json
[06:51:09] <xnotte> when sending through $.get a var "content" with HTML code as a string, i get a 500 error. When sending "content" with a simple string, without HTML tags it works. Do i need to parse the html code or something ? before sending
[06:51:10] <xnotte> this is my code http://pastebin.com/Kbq8DpAV
[06:51:15] <Cork> so the browser takes it as "text" and not "json"
[06:52:01] <hep_> Cork: What about the #demo why is that not displaying?
[06:52:18] <Cork> hep_: cause 1. you tried to parse a js object as json
[06:52:23] <Cork> 2. cause you didn't define json
[06:52:59] <Cork> xnotte: check the network call in the browser network tab
[06:53:09] <hep_> Cork: I updated the codepen: Why aren't lines 31 and 43 working?
[06:53:45] <Cork> hep_: check the browser console
[06:55:55] <hep_> Cork: OK I forgot to add jquery to the codepen. Now it works. Problem is that it isn't working in my app. :(
[07:29:38] <hep_> Ugggg My code works in fiddle but not in my app. http://jsfiddle.net/3bv6vv9n/
[07:33:35] <hep_> It breaks at line 6 in my app.
[07:37:01] <xnotte> Cork: in the network tab the query string parameters is this http://pastebin.com/2WD6NZQU
[07:37:23] <xnotte> and the url it's title=sdf&content=%3Cp%3Easdf%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%0A%3Cp%3Easdf%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%0A%3Cp%3Esad%3C%2Fp%3E%0A%0A%3Cp%3Ef%3C%2Fp%3E%0A&position=left&source=asdf
[07:37:42] <Cork> xnotte: and what does the server expect?
[07:38:12] <xnotte> GetFeedPreview(string title, string content, string position, string source)
[07:39:04] <xnotte> if i change the var content to "text" it runs ok
[07:39:52] <Cork> xnotte: sounds like you should take this in a channel for what ever you use server side then
[07:40:29] <xnotte> Cork: ok thanks
[07:40:39] <thomedy> can someone point me to the proper event for url change
[07:40:43] <thomedy> not hash change but url change
[07:40:48] <thomedy> im using history.js
[07:40:56] <thomedy> since hashbangs are so evil
[07:41:00] <Cork> thomedy: state
[07:41:27] <thomedy> i did onstatechange and my browser didn't seem to recognize it
[07:41:27] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowEventHandlers/onpopstate
[07:41:33] <hellyeah> hey
[07:41:33] <thomedy> ill try again
[07:41:35] <hellyeah> how can i add two animations here http://jsfiddle.net/js2wrydd/5/  check line 96
[07:41:36] <Cork> thomedy: though note that is not for all urls
[07:41:44] <Cork> it is only for url you've changed
[07:42:00] <Cork> when the user leaves the cache of urls you've pushed in there, nothing will fire
[07:42:14] <thomedy> right well unless javascript fails or someone types in an url thats all that will happen
[07:42:33] <thomedy> and honestly im doing the same thing most the time anyway regardless
[07:42:41] <Cork> well the back button when they get to the first page they visited your site on
[07:42:47] <thomedy> except for a very minimal animation occurls on a anchor click
[07:43:16] <thomedy> i thought the history recognized back buttons
[07:43:30] <thomedy> i thought that was one of its featurs
[07:43:42] <Cork> yes, but popState only fires when it moves through the urls you've pushed
[07:44:00] <Cork> not when it goes past the last url you've pushed, and into the users "real" back history
[07:44:39] <thomedy> i guess its not all that crucial at this point i can still develop launch and iterate under those conditions
[07:44:46] <Cork> thomedy: meaning no, you can't use popState as a way to do something similar to beforeunload
[07:45:07] <thomedy> okay ... thank you... i have already pulled up the link that will probably do just fine for now
[07:45:50] <zelol> hi , can someone helps me with select2 chaining value ? http://laravel.io/bin/6LlN4
[07:49:10] <hellyeah> need some help fols
[07:50:05] <hectortrope> Hi jquery very different from java script?/ I am very very newbie to both Java script and jquery which should I start learning with? I don't want to learn all
[07:50:32] <Cork> hectortrope: jquery is javascript (no space)
[07:50:42] <hectortrope> what Cork ?
[07:51:00] <Cork> hectortrope: jquery is a framework to help making modifying dom objects easier in javascript
[07:51:10] <Cork> it isn't a separate language
[07:51:15] <hectortrope> So which one shold I start learning?
[07:51:35] <hectortrope> Learning Js can help jquery?
[07:51:41] <Cork> if you want an easy access point for javascript, jquery is a good start for dom modification
[07:51:52] <Cork> but like i said, it isn't really a different thing
[07:51:57] <hectortrope> where should I start learning?/ any doc?
[07:52:10] <Cork> learn.jquery.com
[07:52:27] <Cork> you will have to have basic javascript knowledge to get going though
[07:52:35] <hectortrope> ut there can I learn JS?
[07:52:41] <hectortrope> Like both are same
[07:52:53] <Cork> eh...
[07:52:53] <hectortrope> so can i say i know JS also  once i go through http://learn.jquery.com/ ?
[07:53:08] <Cork> no it expects you to know the basics of javascript
[07:53:22] <Cork> like i said jquery isn't really an alternative to javascript
[07:53:34] <Cork> it is an alternative to raw access on the document object model
[07:53:35] <hectortrope> Ok
[07:53:37] <Cork> (DOM)
[07:53:57] <Cork> it is written in javascript, and it expects you to write javascript to use it
[07:53:58] <hectortrope> will it take more than a week to learn JS + jquery?
[07:54:11] <Cork> depends on what you mean learn
[07:54:22] <Cork> do you have any programming history?
[07:54:26] <hellyeah> it take my one week
[07:54:26] <Cork> in another language?
[07:54:33] <hellyeah> but you need some practice
[07:54:34] <hellyeah> a lot
[07:55:02] <Cork> if you are familiar with a c like language, then sure you can learn to do basic things with jquery+js is a day or two
[07:55:13] <Cork> if you don't know c like programming syntax at all...
[07:55:26] <Cork> well then you will have a few weeks to even start reading the language
[07:55:27] <hectortrope> I got a need that I have to develop a web app which requireds Java EE and JS and jquery So i want to finish that
[07:56:20] <hectortrope> Any one here knows open UI5?
[07:56:30] <hectortrope> it uses js or jquery/

[08:10:05] <Germanaz0> Hello everyobdy
[08:10:22] <Germanaz0> I'm using mousewheel, but I've a problem, on OSX when I'm scrolling, the inertia is veeeery fast
[08:10:30] <Germanaz0> but when I scroll on windows is normal
[08:17:26] <CocoStorm> Hey guys, I'm trying to post a javascript array to my spring controller but I'm getting 415 unsupported media type error things I've done to try and resolve it results in 400 bad request but right now I'm getting 415.. any ideas anyone? http://pastebin.com/CNFAaSWz
[08:17:42] <CocoStorm> s/javascript/jquery
[08:17:56] <robertmaxrees> *javascript.
[08:18:02] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't invent new datatypes ;)
[08:18:27] <robertmaxrees> and you'll probably need to get something that can parse JSON on the java side.
[08:18:27] <CocoStorm> true
[08:18:41] <CocoStorm> robertmaxrees: it can, it does it automatically using spring
[08:20:01] <robertmaxrees> apparently it doesn't to it all automatically if you're getting 415s ;)
[08:21:21] <fission6> whats the easiest way to get all the data in a form and pass it to $.post(url, DATA)
[08:21:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd hit up a channel about spring / java and see what they have to seay.
[08:21:23] <robertmaxrees> *say
[08:21:35] <robertmaxrees> fission6 $('form').serialize()
[08:21:51] <fission6> can i pass that value in $.post, it looks like a string, not an object
[08:22:05] <robertmaxrees> strings are objects ;)
[08:22:16] <robertmaxrees> also: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/
[08:25:03] <CocoStorm> so the post request looks find javascript side?
[08:25:08] <fission6> thanks robertmaxrees
[08:25:09] <robertmaxrees> CocoStorm yep.
[08:25:52] <fission6> if i want to disable all inputs and buttons in a form how do i do that?
[08:26:01] <fission6> form is $('#message')
[08:26:09] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[08:26:48] <robertmaxrees> specifically api.jquery.com/prop/#prop2
[08:27:32] <zelol> hi , can someone helps me with select2 chaining value ? http://laravel.io/bin/6LlN4
[08:28:20] <fission6> robertmaxrees: specifically api.jquery.com/prop/#prop2?
[08:28:39] <robertmaxrees> fission6 yeah - you use .prop('disabled', true)
[08:28:45] <robertmaxrees> against the inputs.
[08:28:59] <fission6> ok
[08:35:35] <thomedy> i was just thinking onpopstate doestn' seem to be working
[08:35:37] <thomedy> so i was wondering a creative solution
[08:35:46] <robertmaxrees> for what?
[08:35:53] <thomedy> what if on page load i check if the last page was from my own url
[08:36:08] <robertmaxrees> check the referrer or do it server-side.
[08:36:21] <thomedy> that would  mean that it was an anchor or at least should load under controlled conditions
[08:36:31] <robertmaxrees> then do it server-side :)
[08:37:01] <thomedy> well essentially im ajaxing and resisting the urge to hashbang
[08:37:07] <thomedy> and im running into issues
[08:37:11] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to do?
[08:37:13] <thomedy> im running history.js right now
[08:37:19] <thomedy> well im pushstating
[08:37:29] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to update the URL based on content you're loading?
[08:37:37] <thomedy> yes
[08:37:46] <thomedy> and only load apart so i can run a persistent music block
[08:38:01] <thomedy> i need the music to continue on page load unless changed by user
[08:38:22] <thomedy> which i think the only solution unless i write some css requires ajax
[08:38:23] <robertmaxrees> right, so you're trying to ajax in the contents of the page, kind of like what soundcloud does.
[08:38:29] <thomedy> oh maybe
[08:38:35] <triggerClickhelp> So I have some data being loaded through a click function. I want to run a different script as soon as that trigger click finishes loading the data necessary, any suggestions?
[08:38:38] <thomedy> i havent checked soundcloud
[08:38:50] <robertmaxrees> thomedy check it out.
[08:38:57] <robertmaxrees> what you're trying to do isn't unheard of.
[08:39:07] <robertmaxrees> triggerClickhelp your question is phrased weird.
[08:39:25] <thomedy> i can but i still will hit the how to even though im sure its an inspiring example of beauty
[08:39:27] <robertmaxrees> triggerClickhelp could you share some code to show us what you're doing?
[08:39:42] <robertmaxrees> thomas it's simple - you use pushstates to update the url.
[08:39:48] <robertmaxrees> err, thomedy
[08:39:56] <thomedy> i am pusshing the state already
[08:40:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost about what you're having an issue with then.
[08:40:03] <thomedy> history.pushstate(url)
[08:40:05] <thomedy> got it
[08:40:11] <thomedy> and thats working
[08:40:13] <fission6> how do i combine a select if i have smething like $form = $('#someform') and then later want to do, $form AND '#some-notification' fadeOUt - how do i combine $form and '#some-notifcatino' to make one selector
[08:40:31] <CocoStorm> robertmaxrees: when I do console.log on checkedValues I get ["IMG_0765.JPG", "IMG_0839.JPG"] . That is a legit JS array right?  I can post that? why isn't it working?
[08:40:39] <thomedy> im trying to ajax state change and not on click
[08:40:45] <robertmaxrees> CocoStorm i don't know java/spring all that well, sorry.
[08:40:52] <robertmaxrees> thomas "ajax state change"?
[08:40:55] <jayjo> is it bad practice to load js files from within one js file?
[08:41:00] <robertmaxrees> err, thomedy
[08:41:01] <triggerClickhelp> robertmaxrees: I'm using this http://www.dynatable.com/ now the problem is, the dyna script get's runned before my click function happens. I need to have the click function run first before the dynatable runs.
[08:41:18] <robertmaxrees> fission6 var $newJqueryThing = $form.add('#some-notification');
[08:41:24] <thomedy> isn't that the proper method....?
[08:41:25] <fission6> thanks!
[08:41:46] <robertmaxrees> thomedy what are you talking about?  can you share some code?
[08:42:01] <robertmaxrees> jayjo ish.  really depends on what you man.
[08:42:09] <thomedy> sure ill just paste bin a snippet
[08:42:12] <v0lksman> what's the difference between a variable with a $ and one without?  var $foo vs var foo ?
[08:42:21] <robertmaxrees> v0lksman naming convention.
[08:42:28] <robertmaxrees> usually $ means it's a jquery object.
[08:42:33] <robertmaxrees> no special functional difference.
[08:42:57] <jayjo> I mean instead of loading bootstrap, four add-ons, jquery, npm, custom index.js, etc can I just do it once?
[08:43:04] <robertmaxrees> jayjo huh?
[08:43:07] <v0lksman> though so but wanted to make sure...thanks
[08:43:13] <robertmaxrees> you mean concat all of them into one file?
[08:43:40] <jayjo> well that would be one way - is that bad practice?
[08:43:46] <robertmaxrees> jayjo we do that on our sites.  it's a tradeoff, but worth it in our case.
[08:43:59] <robertmaxrees> we have a "vendors.js" type file that's common to basically every page.
[08:44:04] <robertmaxrees> and then page/section specific stuff.
[08:44:11] <jayjo> Yea - that's exactly what I mean and intend on
[08:44:13] <jayjo> I'll do that then
[08:44:14] <jayjo> thanks
[08:44:14] <robertmaxrees> keep in mind that you're really only handling first load cases.
[08:44:35] <robertmaxrees> since browser cache makes subsequent loads less of an issue.   also make sure you enable compression.
[08:44:54] <thomedy> http://pastebin.com/dmJ6grCU
[08:45:03] <thomedy> i made  a quick one
[08:45:14] <robertmaxrees> thomedy so you mean your popstate handler isn't working?
[08:45:22] <fission6> if i have a class "hide" which is "display:none" and i call $(.hide).show(); why isnt it showing up?
[08:45:42] <robertmaxrees> fission6 no way for us to know.
[08:46:09] <thomedy> and since it seems like state change is a different event then a load i put the variable through the $ filter again
[08:46:18] <thomedy> yeah thats it
[08:46:22] <fission6> why not? it works when i remove the hide class and just explicitly say style="display:none" and the show() on that element robertmaxrees
[08:46:26] <robertmaxrees> thomedy that's not the right way to use popstate :)
[08:46:35] <thomedy> okay cool and i just read it for the first time
[08:46:35] <robertmaxrees> your issue is the iife.
[08:46:56] <thomedy> wait hold on is that "if at first you dont succeed"
[08:46:58] <thomedy> i dont know iife
[08:47:20] <robertmaxrees> thomedy the (function($) {})(jQuery) bit.
[08:47:45] <robertmaxrees> that's immediately running the code on pageload.
[08:48:06] <thomedy> yeah as i typed the last bit i realized the normal jquery standard doesn't look like that i was thinking i wanted the $ filter
[08:48:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[08:48:18] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to use a document ready?
[08:48:27] <thomedy> dont worry im trying to be a dad and converstate at the same time
[08:48:34] <thomedy> my kids keep talking to me
[08:48:55] <robertmaxrees> fission6 i have no idea what your page looks like, what other code you have, etc.
[08:49:00] <v0lksman> damn kids
[08:49:26] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/c8e816f704d6 thomedy
[08:49:54] <thomedy> okay sorry there was an aligator sticker  emergency and there might stil be let me check that paste out
[08:49:55] <robertmaxrees> also, it's $('#loaded_content').load(window.location.href + " #loaded_content"); - you're missing a space.
[08:50:02] <Xatenev> fission6: maybe !impoortant
[08:50:04] <Xatenev> just a guess though
[08:50:16] <Xatenev> fission6: cause you would have to show some code
[08:50:44] <thomedy> i just checked out that link that makes way more sense its been a while since i have done the automatic function
[08:50:47] <thomedy> thans for reminiiding
[08:50:47] <thomedy> me
[08:51:07] <robertmaxrees> "automatic function" lol
[08:51:59] <Xatenev> what is an automatic function
[08:52:00] <Xatenev> ??
[08:52:04] <robertmaxrees> nothing.
[08:52:08] <robertmaxrees> he's thinking of IIFE.
[08:52:28] <Xatenev> ah lol^^
[08:52:56] <thomedy> what was iife again....
[08:53:06] <robertmaxrees> http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[08:53:07] <Xatenev> immediately invoked function expression
[08:53:28] <Xatenev> like instead of giving it a pre-defined function u just give it a function straight without defining it before
[08:53:32] <Xatenev> like in the paste :P
[08:53:41] <robertmaxrees> people used to refer to them as "self executing anonymous functions", but that term isn't entirely accurate.
[08:53:45] <decx> what is iife, baby don't hurt me don't hurt me no more
[08:53:54] <decx> soory it's too hot
[08:53:59] <decx> i'm losing my mind
[08:54:34] <robertmaxrees> #boom
[08:55:14] <Caelum> is it a bad idea to do something like $('#some-id').replaceWith(divNodeWithSameId)
[08:55:35] <robertmaxrees> why not replace the contents of #some-id instead?
[08:55:46] <Caelum> yeah that's what I was thinking would work better
[08:55:49] <Caelum> thanks
[08:55:55] <decx> shouldnt matter
[08:56:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah, it's not a huge deal either way.
[08:56:12] <robertmaxrees> though i wonder if replaceWith breaks any references you've got.
[08:56:15] <Caelum> well I'm breaking something apparently
[09:00:32] <`vesrah> i can't seem to figure out why i'm not getting hits on a ('thead th') function
[09:01:26] <`vesrah> http://pastebin.com/fg1Yt9gN
[09:05:00] <jayjo> if I clone an element with an id and then immediately adjust the id, will that work out?
[09:05:39] <unseensoul> Having <p><span>text</span>something</p>, how can I replace the text "something" only
[09:05:53] <unseensoul> Using .text() will get me textsomething all together
[09:08:33] <decx> why can'T you wrap it
[09:09:11] <Caelum> so I did $('#content').empty().append($(newContent).children()); // is this the right way to do this?
[09:09:46] <Caelum> or the most efficient way
[09:09:49] <unseensoul> decx, I can but I didn't want too.
[09:10:04] <decx> if the markup stays consistent you can do: $('p').prop('lastChild').textContent
[09:11:26] <Caelum> and this doesn't seem to break stuff like replacing #content itself
[09:12:12] <shoky> unseensoul: wanting to replace text is exactly a reason to use an element like <span> instead of a bare text node
[09:12:41] <shoky> so, you do want to
[09:12:56] <decx> yeah directly manipulating textnodes isnt exactly failsafe
[09:14:48] <Caelum> anyone?
[09:15:06] <decx> you dont need to empty and append
[09:15:20] <decx> html() will do just fine
[09:16:04] <Caelum> beautiful thank you
[09:16:18] <Caelum> the docs led me to believe it will only take strings, but dom elements work fine
[09:17:21] <decx> yea, strings, elements and collections will do
[09:17:40] <jayjo> Is it OK to clone an element by id and then rewrite the id, or is there a way to clone only the first element of another selector?
[09:18:05] <decx> who in the what now?
[09:18:12] <decx> i dont get the second part
[09:19:20] <shoky> $('#id').clone().prop('id', 'whatever')         $(selector).first().clone()
[09:19:35] <jayjo> Eg I have <form> <input id='firstField'> </input> </form> and want to add additional fields with jquery. I want to duplicate the field but I dont want the conflict of two identical 'ids'
[09:20:38] <jayjo> so if I do .clone() does it duplicate it 'locally' (in memory... I don't know the correct way it happens in js) and I can adjust the id 'in place' and then append it where it needs to go in the dom?
[09:20:42] <jayjo> Is that the correct way to think about it?
[09:20:57] <shoky> yep
[09:21:11] <jayjo> OK thank you
[09:22:51] <Android0> I am quickly comming to the conclusion that codecademy is a fucking terrible resource >.>
[09:25:58] <decx> jayjo: yes, loop through the clones children, check for id and append a number based on how many you added
[09:29:32] <Ice_Strike> $(".tab_session").trigger("click");
[09:29:47] <Ice_Strike> How to define which .tab_session to click
[09:29:55] <Ice_Strike> I like to click the first one
[09:30:05] <decx> eq(0).trigger ....
[09:30:17] <Ice_Strike> Ah ok
[09:30:23] <Ice_Strike> or I could try data
[09:30:44] <decx> this for jquery ui tabs?
[09:31:01] <Ice_Strike> What about? data-session-section="compliance" ?
[09:31:06] <nodist> .tab_session:first-child
[09:31:06] <Ice_Strike> Find that and trigger click it
[09:31:22] <nodist> .tab_session[data-session-section="compliance}
[09:31:25] <nodist> .tab_session[data-session-section="compliance]
[09:31:33] <Ice_Strike> Oh would work?
[09:31:36] <nodist> missed a quote
[09:31:38] <nodist> .tab_session[data-session-section="compliance"]
[09:31:57] <nodist> that should work for that class and that attribute
[09:32:03] <decx> use filter if you want to select based on attributes
[09:32:06] <Ice_Strike> Great
[09:32:09] <Ice_Strike> Let me check
[09:32:14] <decx> you just pollute your selector cache otherwise
[09:32:26] <nodist> ^^listen to decx
[09:32:39] <Ice_Strike> Awesome
[09:32:42] <Ice_Strike> That work
[09:32:50] <nodist> works but its not the best way
[09:32:54] <Ice_Strike> Thanks nodist and decx
[09:33:03] <Ice_Strike> Whats the best way?
[09:33:09] <decx> allTabsCollection.filter(function(){  return $(this).data('stuff') == 'that' })
[09:34:09] <decx> now you only look up all tabs once to put them in the cache allTabsCollection var
[09:34:14] <Caelum> what's the best way to reduce flicker and image reloading when you're replacing the contents of a div and stuff like this
[09:34:43] <nodist> $('.tab_session').filter('[data-session-section="compliance"]')
[09:34:46] <decx> images have a load events, listen for that and only append when it's ready
[09:35:12] <decx> this doesnt use jquery fast data cache nodist
[09:35:19] <nodist> ah
[09:35:27] <Ice_Strike> Hmm I see
[09:35:35] <Ice_Strike> put all the data in the varible you mean
[09:35:45] <Ice_Strike> then use those varible to execute it?
[09:36:25] <triggerClickhelp> decx: Is there a better way of doing this? http://jsfiddle.net/p6bsLjs8/1/
[09:36:46] <Ice_Strike> What does filter do?
[09:36:52] <syzygy_> When you declare a variables such as: var $example = $(‘.example’), how would specify an instance of $example w/ a class, such as $( $example + ‘.selected’) ???
[09:37:36] <Caelum> the images only seem to load when the element is attached to the document and is displayed? So how would I do this nicely?
[09:38:09] <decx> syzygy_: $example.filter('.selected')
[09:38:33] <syzygy_> decx: worried that’d be it, thanks!
[09:38:43] <decx> what' worrysome about it?
[09:38:46] <decx> filter is great
[09:39:30] <syzygy_> ah just suspected that’d be the correct approach even though I hadn’t tried it @decx
[09:39:47] <Caelum> decx: can I stuff the elements into a display:none; div, wait for images to load, then put all the stuff where I wanted it to go?
[09:40:04] <decx> triggerClickhelp: if you need to wait for stuff then use a callback that'll init your dynatable
[09:40:44] <decx> you can just put it in a var Caelum
[09:41:06] <Caelum> decx: oh so images even in detached DOM elements will still load?
[09:41:19] <decx> probably
[09:41:25] <decx> i never tried with jquery
[09:41:40] <Caelum> ok, I will do more research, thanks for your help!
[09:41:44] <decx> new Image('url') ... onload does it
[09:43:21] <Ice_Strike> Which is better and why? http://pastebin.com/EmPAGMxF
[09:43:54] <decx> that's not how you use filter
[09:44:11] <Ice_Strike> Oh?
[09:45:14] <decx> http://pastebin.com/9Rt1tJpk
[09:47:12] <Ice_Strike> I understand
[09:47:20] <Ice_Strike> What the benefit of this?
[09:47:29] <Ice_Strike> why store in varible.
[09:48:02] <decx> many
[10:05:25] <triggerClickhelp> decx, can't seem to get it to work . _ .
[10:06:32] <nodist> link?
[10:09:04] <kongthap> http://paste.ofcode.org/YYsvunaVwa4yVPQCtvZawL , i'm doing file uploading, at the server side i lost the name of <input> which is "xxx", how to fix it?, i think i did it the wrong way at jquery part, please help
[10:11:03] <triggerClickhelp> nodist: http://jsfiddle.net/p6bsLjs8/1/
[10:11:50] <triggerClickhelp> nodist: trying to set up a callback that'll init my dynatable after click function finishes
[10:17:59] <Uranium|OC> kongthap:  i just used this maybe it can help you http://abandon.ie/notebook/simple-file-uploads-using-jquery-ajax
[10:18:21] <kongthap> Uranium|OC, thanks :)
[10:19:40] <nodist> triggerClickhelp are you using ajax to load this table?
[10:26:46] <triggerClickhelp> $.each
[10:27:11] <triggerClickhelp> but I call using ajax, then break it down using $.each based on the result
[10:27:17] <nodist> yeah thats why
[10:27:38] <nodist> you need to call the dyntable in the success part of the ajax
[10:28:03] <nodist> the global js can't see the html you load in
[10:28:22] <nodist> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19717529/jquery-ajax-parse-through-return-html
[10:29:06] <nodist> do you have a more complete example
[10:30:26] <triggerClickhelp> yessir
[10:45:41] <triggerClickhelp> nodist: http://jsfiddle.net/e2Lcu3Lh/5/
[10:46:57] <nodist> is all of this html and data on the page when it its loaded?
[10:47:19] <nodist> I mean page load
[10:48:39] <Caelum> I hate people that capture image links and rewrite them to page
[10:52:50] <triggerClickhelp> no, it's done through a click because I use tokens to register which data to pull up
[10:52:55] <nodist> triggerClickhelp http://jsfiddle.net/e2Lcu3Lh/6/
[10:53:20] <nodist> as is your example should work fine
[10:53:26] <Caelum> decx: well it does not seem to load detached img nodes: http://jsfiddle.net/rz30kzcf/

[10:57:03] <triggerClickhelp> nodist: problem is, the way it works there is that the json is already loaded, so it's easier. I need to wait for it to pull the data before dynatable loads
[10:57:28] <shoky> Caelum: it works fine if you put a normal image link. that one is weird
[10:57:46] <nodist> then call the dynatable after the data loads
[10:57:51] <triggerClickhelp> currently dynatable just runs even with out the data being loaded which is why I set a timeout (which has worked so far), but I want a cleaner way of doing it.
[10:58:11] <nodist> do you have a link to the current working example?
[10:58:22] <triggerClickhelp> not really, its all on my desktop
[10:59:00] <nodist> can you post the function that is loading the data
[10:59:46] <nodist> or part
[11:06:31] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/megmLd4a/8/   <-why no validate the array of input text, th main idea is: tthe first input have a qty of 9, the rest input texts(array of inputs) need be compared each one with the first, why not work this code? thanks   how to fix?
[11:07:06] <cjohnson> jak2000: you have an error, open your console
[11:07:53] <ayushgp> hello
[11:08:09] <ayushgp> can someone help me with getJSON() ?
[11:08:24] <triggerClickhelp> nodist the ajax call is complicated to get to where I need it to be lol, but it's a normal ajax call, the real magic is suppose to happen on the click
[11:08:38] <wave|> Ask, don't ask to ask
[11:09:04] <ayushgp> I'm making an api call to twitch.tv
[11:09:49] <ayushgp> http://pastebin.com/mScAzxDp
[11:10:09] <ayushgp> it gives this error: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token :
[11:10:33] <jak2000> cjohnson: http://jsfiddle.net/megmLd4a/9/
[11:10:36] <nodist> triggerClickhelp does the click cause the data to load from a remote resource?
[11:10:38] <jak2000> calidate is not defined :(
[11:10:42] <jak2000> *validate
[11:10:45] <triggerClickhelp> pretty much
[11:11:28] <nodist> triggerClickhelp then what you want to do is do the each and call the dytable once the call has completed
[11:11:32] <cjohnson> jak2000: yep, now fix that issue
[11:11:56] <nodist> as in do the formating in the callback
[11:12:06] <wave|> ayushgp| what is the calculated url it creates?
[11:12:18] <ayushgp> the url is correct
[11:12:27] <ayushgp> it even receives an object
[11:12:58] <ayushgp> http://codepen.io/ayushgp/pen/aOYEzM
[11:13:04] <ayushgp> here in your console
[11:13:12] <ayushgp> you'll be able to see
[11:13:44] <shoky> jak2000: your fiddle is set to "onLoad" on the top-left meaning it puts your code into an onload function, so your code is not global. use "No wrap" if you want it in the global scope. but better to not use onchange attribute at all
[11:13:51] <wave|> ayushgp| api.twitch.tv/kraken/?streams=jQuery213022167547745630145_1436292788339&_=1436292788340:1 <<<< see the :1 ?
[11:14:02] <ayushgp> yeah
[11:14:22] <ayushgp> so how do i remove it?
[11:16:21] <ayushgp> @wave| what is that :1 there for?
[11:16:48] <jak2000> shoky no wrap in the body or in the header
[11:17:21] <wave|> ayushgp| anyone else that knows $ more can explain, but fairly certain ajax calls include a random string so that the browser actually makes the call (and doesn't just pull it from cache)
[11:17:36] <wave|> There's a way to turn it off, i'm looking
[11:17:48] <shoky> jak2000: doesn't matter for fixing the scope issue. but better to not use onchange at all:  http://jsfiddle.net/megmLd4a/10/
[11:18:08] <ayushgp> oh
[11:19:43] <triggerClickhelp> nodist: so it runs fine in terms of it forming dynatable when the click is done, but it takes a while to append the data, so it's only grabbing like 6 results out of 43 in the dynatable before the append completes
[11:20:06] <shoky> ayushgp: because you have =? in your url, jquery thinks it's a JSONP request. the way you're building the url seems wrong
[11:20:11] <jak2000> shoky, testd thanks... i think this reg exp is bad: var re = /[^0-9]/g;  (only need capture numbers, not decimal numbers), always display this message: Invalid qty2: 4
[11:20:31] <shoky> ayushgp: and whatever you see in the console in the codepen is just what $.getJSON returns which is the jqXHR object. doesn't mean the request worked
[11:20:32] <v0lksman> http://jsbin.com/vohepibise/edit?html,js,output can anyone tell me why the $div.append() isn't working?
[11:20:42] <ayushgp> it needcs to be a jsonp request because its cross domain
[11:20:54] <ayushgp> @shoky
[11:20:59] <shoky> ayushgp: the server must support jsonp for it to work
[11:21:28] <ayushgp> it does support it
[11:21:33] <shoky> why are you building a url like   /?streams=?
[11:22:20] <ayushgp> to get a jsonp
[11:22:39] <ayushgp> otherwise it goves a no access control header error
[11:23:12] <ayushgp> no 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header*
[11:23:29] <shoky> ok but you're building the url wrong
[11:24:06] <ayushgp> I'm doing it according to the jquery getJSON() docs
[11:24:17] <jak2000> is valid this regexp: var re = /[^0-9]/g;   for accept onlynumbers?
[11:24:57] <shoky> ayushgp: according to their api it needs to be called "callback" not "stream"
[11:25:16] <shoky> ayushgp: anyway it's nicer to do it with $.ajax   http://codepen.io/anon/pen/eNMLYj
[11:25:58] <shoky> ayushgp: well i guess this is the url you meant  http://codepen.io/anon/pen/mJxGyV
[11:26:09] <shoky> ayushgp: you needed it to be  /streams?callback=?
[11:26:18] <shoky> but still, just use $.ajax
[11:27:16] <ayushgp> $.ajax will return a JSON?
[11:28:03] <shoky> ayushgp:  with dataType: 'jsonp'  you'll get a parsed object, yes
[11:28:16] <shoky> ayushgp: you can check your console in my fiddle...
[11:28:19] <ayushgp> ohh
[11:28:28] <ayushgp> alright let me try it
[11:28:35] <ayushgp> Thanks @shoky
[11:28:47] <shoky> yw
[11:31:37] <ayushgp> @shoky you were right ading ?callback=? at the end of the URL worked!
[11:31:49] <shoky> :\
[11:35:40] <triggerClickhelp> nodist: alright, so it's actually just the append. My function is firing as soon as the ajax call is finished, but my data hasn't appended completely. So dynatable is only grabbing what is visible and ignoring any new appends.
[11:36:17] <triggerClickhelp> That's why setTimeout has been working, but it's obviously not the solution lol
[11:36:47] <printForever> TypeError: $(...).delay(...).fadeIn is not a function
[11:36:55] <printForever> .hide() is not a function
[11:37:01] <printForever> .fadeIn is not a function...
[11:37:06] <printForever> I'm going to shoot someone
[11:37:08] <printForever> pretty soon
[11:37:53] <printForever> I wanted to show a div, after the page is loaded
[11:38:03] <printForever> and I was able to do that with setTimeout
[11:38:03] <nodist> triggerClickhelp how are you grabbing the data eg $.getJSON $.ajax etc?
[11:38:23] <printForever> but when I tried to run it on a website I get this errors
[11:38:28] <printForever> $('#overlay, #wt_popup').hide().delay(1200).fadeIn('slow'); << I tried that
[11:39:30] <printForever> when I type in $().jquery;
[11:39:38] <printForever> I get $(...) is undefined
[11:39:57] <printForever> also, same thing for $.fn.jquery
[11:40:01] <jayjo> is there a helper method to limit a '--' on an integer (like count--; or count++; to not go below 0?)
[11:40:10] <jayjo> a convenience method
[11:40:16] <nodist> triggerClickhelp ask yourseld is it the append or has all all of the data not loaded?
[11:40:18] <triggerClickhelp> nodist .ajax
[11:40:25] <printForever> when I do jQuery.fn.jquery I get 1.8.3
[11:40:35] <nodist> and you are calling the function to do the appends in the success?
[11:40:46] <printForever> yes I do
[11:41:03] <shoky> printForever: either some code ran jQuery.noConflict()  or some code overwrote the global $
[11:41:23] <printForever> so I should replace everything with jQuery?
[11:41:26] <printForever> shoky
[11:41:38] <shoky> printForever: or find the code that overwrote it
[11:41:49] <digifiv5e> {Q} if i have 2 elements that are using .hover() and i mouse back and forth between them over and over, then stop, it'll continue to animate for a few seconds (to catch up) -- how do i stop that from happening
[11:41:52] <printForever> jQuery('bla').hide()
[11:42:05] <printForever> tnx shoky
[11:42:05] <shoky> printForever: or do something like  (function($){ ... })(jQuery)
[11:42:20] <Caelum> shoky: why is that img tag weird
[11:42:20] <printForever> ouh, thats great, tnx shoky
[11:42:37] <triggerClickhelp> It may be that all the data hasn't loaded, since it's $.each response
[11:42:41] <triggerClickhelp> nodist
[11:42:48] <shoky> Caelum: the url is weird, not the tag. when you open that url sometimes it opens the image, sometimes a web page.  choose a different image ;p
[11:43:19] <triggerClickhelp> but even then, I still place my dynatable after $.each and it's still being picked up way faster than the appends itself
[11:43:20] <nodist> triggerClickhelp can you post the ajax call?
[11:43:58] <Caelum> shoky: I was just trying to find an image on google image search and they all do this shit
[11:44:03] <qakhan> is there any free database grid for jquery?
[11:44:16] <shoky> Caelum:  works fine for me with e.g. http://www.addic7ed.com/images/addic7edheader.jpg
[11:44:37] <NoiseEee> qakhan: pretty sure googling should let you know
[11:45:16] <Caelum> shoky: awesome thanks
[11:45:51] <Caelum> shoky: can I do something like $('img[complete=false]', node)
[11:46:11] <shoky> Caelum: no idea what you want that to do
[11:46:26] <Caelum> find images that aren't loaded
[11:46:38] <shoky> nope
[11:46:45] <qakhan> NoiseEee i found jui_datagrid
[11:46:57] <qakhan> do you think it is good?
[11:48:16] <jak2000> shoky, why always alert me is a invalid qty 4? by sample
[11:49:02] <Caelum> what am I doing wrong here: https://gist.github.com/rkitover/2fdd96bea09e552bab7f
[11:49:33] <shoky> jak2000:  /^[0-9]/g  means text with no digits in it
[11:50:33] <shoky> Caelum: donno what's newContent, and imagesLoading isn't returning anything
[11:50:41] <Caelum> oh duh
[11:50:48] <shoky> Caelum: didn't think to use .complete property
[11:51:01] <Caelum> newContent is a detached div
[11:52:17] <triggerClickhelp> nodist: http://jsfiddle.net/e2Lcu3Lh/7/
[11:52:39] <triggerClickhelp> it's just missing inputs to actually work
[11:53:02] <triggerClickhelp> but I can't really give the input values out ;(
[11:55:46] <nodist> triggerClickhelp first try changing the then to done
[11:55:53] <nodist> http://jsfiddle.net/e2Lcu3Lh/9/
[11:58:10] <shoky> triggerClickhelp: you're doing an $.each  and inside of the loop you're doing another .get() and inside there doing the .dynatable() call
[11:58:20] <shoky> triggerClickhelp: so you're calling it multiple times
[11:58:26] <shoky> and then adding more content after it's already run
[11:59:11] <shoky> assuming that the this response has more than 1 item:  optly.get(experimentListEndpoint).then(function(response)
[12:00:27] <triggerClickhelp> yea it has a bunch of objects that I can dive into
[12:00:37] <triggerClickhelp> that calls for each experiment
[12:00:53] <triggerClickhelp> then from each experiment, I call for the result
[12:01:28] <triggerClickhelp> the thing is that dynatable just runs as soon as the click happens rathe than waiting for the ajax to finish
[12:01:37] <shoky> triggerClickhelp: you can use $.when.apply here to wait for multiple results
[12:02:31] <Caelum> shoky: I added the return, still doesn't work. For some reason the complete property is never false even though I can see that the images aren't loaded.
[12:02:36] <triggerClickhelp> shoky where would I apply that?
[12:03:08] <shoky> triggerClickhelp:  like this  http://jsfiddle.net/e2Lcu3Lh/12/
[12:07:32] <shoky> triggerClickhelp: oh sorry $.map swaps the order of the callback arguments   http://jsfiddle.net/e2Lcu3Lh/13/
[12:13:30] <Chunk2> should I used jquery?
[12:14:00] <Caelum> yes
[12:15:33] <triggerClickhelp> shoky dynatable still loading before results lol
[12:20:04] <theCole> Chunk2: depends. what do you need to do?
[12:25:24] <robertmaxrees> deep
[12:27:07] <triggerClickhelp> dynatable literally doesn't give a crap about when it should run
[12:27:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:29:08] <triggerClickhelp> I have a click function that loads data, well, I'm telling dynatable to load after the ajax is finished appending the data, but dynatable keeps triggering on the click function. The only way Ive been able to keep it from actually running is by setTimeout
[12:29:21] <robertmaxrees> show me.
[12:29:39] <robertmaxrees> 'cause something tells me i know what's up :)
[12:30:22] <triggerClickhelp> Well this is the current variation we've worked on: http://jsfiddle.net/e2Lcu3Lh/13/
[12:30:35] <triggerClickhelp> I've updated my code along with it, but it just keeps triggering on click lol
[12:30:40] <robertmaxrees> where's the ajax call?
[12:31:07] <triggerClickhelp> well it's missing the token input cause I can't really hand out the tokens ;(
[12:31:20] <robertmaxrees> i mean in the code.
[12:31:35] <triggerClickhelp> starts at line 5
[12:31:42] <triggerClickhelp> then I use it again inside the click function
[12:31:59] <robertmaxrees> here's the issue - tjhis is 1821 lines and doesn't run, so you need to tell me where to look ;)
[12:32:12] <triggerClickhelp> and line 22
[12:32:13] <triggerClickhelp> :D
[12:32:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:32:31] <robertmaxrees> are ypu talking about $.when.apply($, requests).then(function() { ?
[12:32:44] <triggerClickhelp> yea
[12:32:45] <robertmaxrees> that isn't waiting until all the gets have funished?
[12:32:57] <triggerClickhelp> nope, it's just applying itself
[12:32:58] <robertmaxrees> something tells me requests isn't what you think it is.
[12:33:56] <shoky> triggerClickhelp: i didn't notice the "return false" and "return" that you had in there before
[12:34:03] <robertmaxrees> :)
[12:34:06] <shoky> triggerClickhelp: i guess that's the issue
[12:34:10] <robertmaxrees> that'll cause issues.
[12:35:06] <robertmaxrees> also: you're returning the then of the .get()
[12:35:11] <robertmaxrees> which looks funky to me.
[12:35:19] <robertmaxrees> though i get tripped up by that.
[12:35:59] <shoky> nah that's fine robertmaxrees. he needed it only for knowing when it's complete, not for getting the data again
[12:36:41] <robertmaxrees> but that .then()'s promise will resolve automatically, won't it?
[12:36:58] <shoky> only if the .get() itself already resolved
[12:38:10] <shoky> triggerClickhelp: this should fix that issue i guess  http://jsfiddle.net/e2Lcu3Lh/14/
[12:38:14] <BillCriswell> If you wanted to have a class on an element for 5 seconds, then removed for two seconds, repeated forever, what would be the best approach? setInterval with settimeout?
[12:38:23] <BillCriswell> so many brain farts today
[12:40:41] <Caelum> oh god fucking dammit, I forgot the return in the filter function too
[12:41:45] <Caelum> gotta get it into my head that you must use the return statement in js
[12:41:59] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:42:11] <robertmaxrees> if you want to return something, sure.
[12:42:18] <robertmaxrees> oh you mean unlike ruby.
[12:42:22] <robertmaxrees> and with that, loonhc.,
[12:42:25] <robertmaxrees> *loonch
[12:42:27] <Caelum> unlike a huge number of languages
[12:44:20] <shoky> BillCriswell: css animation?
[12:44:37] <s34n> I have a button that displays a jqueryui menu when clicked. But when the menu becomes visible, it pushes other content out of the way. How do I make the menu float?
[12:45:20] <shoky> Caelum: lol
[12:45:30] <BillCriswell> shoky: I need to interact with the children of the element I'm switching the class on, so I was thinking just adjusting the classes might be a better approach.. I guess I could use those animation event listeners and do something based on that.
[12:46:06] <BillCriswell> shoky: http://jsbin.com/jucilu/3/edit?css,js,output is what I was going for, but it felt overcomplicated
[12:46:36] <notchris> Can anyone tell me which function actually changes the password? https://tickets.ctsciencecenter.org/public/crm_change_password.asp?txtLoginName=test@test.com
[12:47:05] <BillCriswell> ick, gets weird when the tab loses focus
[12:47:43] <shoky> BillCriswell: i prefer never using setInterval, just setTimeout
[12:48:22] <BillCriswell> yes i'm going to switch to that approach
[12:48:27] <BillCriswell> damn setInterval
[12:48:53] <shoky> damn jsbin's new "share" popup confuses me
[12:49:00] <BillCriswell> shoky: Same.
[12:49:02] <shoky> how tf do i update a bin
[12:49:08] <shoky> and lock changes
[12:49:17] <BillCriswell> Think you need to click the "snapshot" radio
[12:49:20] <shoky> like update in jsfiddle
[12:49:30] <shoky> it's already checked tho
[12:49:39] <BillCriswell> oh haha
[12:49:54] <shoky> do you see the updated code  http://jsbin.com/jucilu/3/edit?css,js,output
[12:49:57] <shoky> do i see it
[12:50:02] <shoky> no :\
[12:50:14] <BillCriswell> i do not
[12:50:29] <shoky> oh shoulda read the big yellow notification bar
[12:50:38] <shoky> ctrl-shift-s
[12:50:49] <shoky> http://jsbin.com/toqovunixa/1/edit?css,js,output
[12:50:58] <BillCriswell> i still prefer just clicking "update" and getting a new url
[12:51:07] <shoky> yup
[12:51:34] <BillCriswell> shoky: sweet, was just about to do that haha
[12:51:36] <BillCriswell> thanks.
[12:51:40] <shoky> ;p
[12:52:42] <triggerClickhelp> D:
[12:52:58] <triggerClickhelp> so dynatable stopped loading in completely lol
[12:53:22] <shoky> triggerClickhelp show your code
[12:56:18] <triggerClickhelp> shoky: looks just like yours http://jsfiddle.net/e2Lcu3Lh/15/ lol
[12:59:14] <shoky> triggerClickhelp: well, start debugging ;p
[12:59:21] <triggerClickhelp> been trying
[12:59:22] <triggerClickhelp> :D
[12:59:42] <shoky> or, share a live working testcase ;p
[12:59:55] <triggerClickhelp> That'll be hard D:
[13:00:07] <shoky> sry bro
[13:00:18] <triggerClickhelp> np, you've helped a lot so far
[13:03:30] <triggerClickhelp> shoky: so it has to do with something here: 		requests.push(request);
[13:07:21] <triggerClickhelp> How come I'm pushing the results back into an array?
[13:11:19] <tandroid> I can't seem to wrap my head around $.proxy()
[13:11:57] <s34n> how do I nudge jqueryui to display a menu with position:absolute instead of position:relative?
[13:14:26] <tandroid> Ok, this helps, https://gist.github.com/branneman/5814160
[13:14:37] <tandroid> But doesn't this just make for really confusing code?
[13:18:33] <muranjan> How can I access [{"1":"Anotomy"},{"3":"Bioinformatics”}] using for loop
[13:19:16] <muranjan> for(i=0; i<jsonResult.length; i++){
[13:19:16] <muranjan> 	    	 $select.append('<option value=' + jsonResult[i]+ '>' + jsonResult[i] + '</option>');
[13:19:17] <muranjan> 	    }
[13:24:27] <tandroid> Anybody know if it's possible to change the play button on owl carousel.
[13:24:45] <tandroid> It seems like it should be so simple but the play trigger doesn't seem to work.
[13:33:30] <rowanG> Hello guys, I think I have found a bug in the latest jquery. But since I have less than a week of experience with javascript at all I would like someone to verify. I have a jsfiddle where I can easily demonstrate the issue!
[13:34:38] <rowanG> Hello guys, I think I have found a bug in the latest jquery. But since I have less than a week of experience with javascript at all I would like someone to verify. I have a jsfiddle where I can easily demonstrate the issue!
[13:36:31] <tandroid> rowanG: Can you paste the link to the jsfiddle?
[13:36:55] <rowanG> http://jsfiddle.net/fnaz0ew1/
[13:37:18] <rowanG> the bug occurs in the latest version. The same code ran using jsfiddles jquery ui works!
[13:41:31] <rowanG> the purpose was to be able to resize the accordion while also having a fixed width while it is inactive. I have to set the width and height of the parent element after closing so the parent wrapper won't obstruct widgets below it. The exact same code works with the jquery ui jsfiddle provides.
[13:43:49] <Chunk2> Is there a way to do a non-ajax POST in jquery?

[14:19:01] <rowanG> Hello guys, I think I have found a bug in the latest jquery. But since I have less than a week of experience with javascript at all I would like someone to verify. I have a jsfiddle where I can easily demonstrate the issue!
[14:21:28] <rowanG> Hello guys, I think I have found a bug in the latest jquery ui. But since I have less than a week of experience with javascript at all I would like someone to verify. I have a jsfiddle where I can easily demonstrate the issue!
[14:22:55] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/jvxnnee5/1/ @ cool_boy
[14:22:59] <mikieb> I've cerate a js fiddle of the above. If anyone could help me to get it to output an array of 2 rows instead of 4 id be very greatful. thanks. https://jsfiddle.net/nLcepfv7/2/
[14:23:23] <NoiseEee> rowanG: paste the link
[14:23:38] <rowanG> http://jsfiddle.net/fnaz0ew1/1/
[14:24:30] <NoiseEee> whats the bug rowanG?
[14:26:04] <rowanG> when you resize the accordion the ',accordion('option','active') doesn't return the correct state
[14:26:21] <rowanG> it returns 0 when it is false and false when it is 0
[14:26:38] <rowanG> but it returns the correct value as long as you don't resize
[14:27:24] <rowanG> the example I give logs the output to console!\
[14:27:39] <NoiseEee> where do I see those values? how?  i don't see anything on console... also, 0 is falsey yeah?
[14:28:07] <NoiseEee> oh, in your 'going to'
[14:28:17] <rowanG> 0 is falsy but you can do === and it will only be true if it is actually false
[14:28:49] <rowanG> in js fiddle it's hard :/ you can do it if with chrome if you click inspect element in the result window
[14:29:37] <rowanG> then there is a js console in the new panel
[14:29:45] <NoiseEee> hmmm, not sure exactly rowanG, sorry
[14:29:52] <NoiseEee> i don't know much about -ui
[14:29:58] <rowanG> thank you anyway for trying
[15:12:48] <shoky> triggerClickhelp: you're not pushing the result, you're pushing a jquery ajax promise, which is the thing you can call .then on, or pass to $.when
[15:13:08] <triggerClickhelp> yea I read into it way later
[15:13:09] <triggerClickhelp> :D
[15:13:18] <shoky> ;D
[15:13:40] <triggerClickhelp> It's still doesn't show up, but I also switched to dataTables();
[15:13:47] <triggerClickhelp> since it has more functionality :l
[15:13:51] <shoky> o
[15:14:33] <triggerClickhelp> but still not showing up, it seems like it's just not grabbing the requests when it's done. I'm about to head out soon, so maybe a fresh start tomorrow will help
[15:15:16] <shoky> how many requests are there anyway
[15:31:12] <triggerClickhelp> shoky the thing is, it depends on how many experiments are going on
[15:31:20] <triggerClickhelp> and how many goals are attached to each experiment
[15:31:21] <triggerClickhelp> > _ <
[15:31:28] <triggerClickhelp> could be 20, could be 120
[15:31:39] <mojtaba1> Hi, Is this expression correct? ( I want to return all input of type text inside the form) 		$("form.order_form:input:text").each(
[15:33:25] <tandroid> mojtaba1: $('.order_form[type="text"]') would probably be what you want.
[15:33:43] <mojtaba1> tandroid: thx
[15:36:30] <triggerClickhelp> shoky: And I'm still new to JSON data creation - so this has been quite an experience
[15:37:07] <triggerClickhelp> anyways, I'm out
[15:37:08] <triggerClickhelp> :
[15:37:17] <triggerClickhelp> thanks for the help earlier
[15:42:36] <CocoStorm> Hi, I'd like to ajax post javascript array how do I do this? I don't use stringily right? since that turns it into a string?
[15:49:03] <shoky> CocoStorm:  you can post it as a json string (and parse the json on server)  e.g.  $.post('/url', {thearray: JSON.stringify(myarray)})
[15:50:32] <CocoStorm> shoky: so parse a string?
[15:51:04] <shoky> CocoStorm: you always send a string anyway, so yea
[15:52:54] <mojtaba1> Could  you please take a look at this http://www.kabobhutcanada.com/test11/form-menu (in the console it says Invalid left-hand side in assignment.)
[15:59:08] <mojtaba1> basically my problem is with var. Should I use it every time I want to use a variable?
[15:59:48] <mojtaba1> what is the difference between these: var a="a", b = "b"; and var a="a"; var b = "b";
[16:01:11] <tandroid> mojtaba1: If you don't use the var keyword it declares it in the global scope.
[16:01:16] <tandroid> Are you familiar with scope?
[16:01:25] <mojtaba1> tandroid: yes
[16:01:39] <mojtaba1> tandroid: is it the same as in other languages?
[16:01:47] <tandroid> Not most.
[16:01:57] <tandroid> it's functional scope as opposed to block scope
[16:02:10] <tandroid> or object scope might be a better way to put it.
[16:02:23] <tandroid> and functions are objects.
[16:02:56] <mojtaba1> tandroid: could you please check your console for this address?
[16:02:57] <mojtaba1> http://www.kabobhutcanada.com/test11/form-menu
[16:03:25] <mojtaba1> tandroid: the problem is in the if statement
[16:04:07] <tandroid> I think it's the way you're calling jCaption maybe
[16:04:19] <mojtaba1> tandroid: jCaption?
[16:04:48] <tandroid> It would usually be $('.caption').jCaption(); rather than using the "new" keyword
[16:04:53] <tandroid> It's in that same file.
[16:05:38] <tandroid> The ajax request looks fine to me.
[16:05:41] <mojtaba1> tandroid: I am using joomla. It is for that
[16:06:16] <mojtaba1> tandroid: please check lines 643 to 647
[16:06:29] <mojtaba1> tandroid: in the source code. The problem is there
[16:07:23] <mojtaba1> tandroid: basically I just want to pass those that have value greater than 0 to php file.
[16:08:15] <bango> $('O').caption(myCaption());
[16:08:56] <mojtaba1> tandroid: did you have time to check that?
[16:09:00] <tandroid> Yeah, I'm looking
[16:09:06] <tandroid> So there are a couple of things.
[16:09:24] <tandroid> First, you don't need a semi-colon at the end of that if statement, but that shouldn't really matter.
[16:09:52] <tandroid> second, those console.log() messages should be something like console.log("url = " + url);
[16:10:06] <tandroid> That could be the problem.
[16:10:18] <tandroid> or why you're getting an error at least
[16:10:47] <mojtaba1> tandroid: let me run it again with this changes.
[16:10:51] <mojtaba1> tandroid: plz wait
[16:12:28] <tandroid> Also, this might answer your variable question pretty well https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var
[16:12:55] <tandroid> Lots of good info on that page.
[16:13:57] <mojtaba1> tandroid: thx. I am getting new error, Unexpected end of input
[16:14:48] <mojtaba1> tandroid: I will check that link, thanks
[16:17:55] <tandroid> Hmm… all that code looks syntactically correct.
[16:19:11] <mojtaba1> tandroid: It says unxpected token )
[16:21:14] <tandroid> mojtaba1: Oh at the end you need another "});"
[16:21:24] <tandroid> at line 653
[16:21:58] <mojtaba1> tandroid: why?
[16:22:28] <tandroid> Because you haven't closed your submit event
[16:22:49] <tandroid> Or I guess your document.ready
[16:23:26] <tandroid> This is all inside of the self calling function starting on line 581
[16:23:28] <mojtaba1> tandroid: I have closed it and then I closed (function($)...
[16:23:48] <tandroid> What text editor are you using?
[16:23:57] <mojtaba1> gedti
[16:24:05] <mojtaba1> tandroid:
[16:24:38] <mojtaba1> tandroid: let me add that
[16:25:12] <tandroid> You might consider adding a plugin to auto indent your code. right now you can't see that it's all inside of that other function.
[16:26:06] <mojtaba1> tandroid: Thanks, I will do that for sure. I added that at the end, but still same problem
[16:28:46] <mojtaba1> tandroid: do you use the same editor?
[16:28:57] <tandroid> so the last thing I see is on line 655, it should be "})(jQuery);"
[16:29:08] <tandroid> no, I use vim or webstorm.
[16:29:11] <tandroid> sometimes sublime text
[16:29:36] <tandroid> I recommend sublime text.
[16:30:54] <uncovery> hey guys, it seems that jquery datepicker is not showing the right dates, can anyone help me with that? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31270845/jquery-datepicker-displays-wrong-dates
[16:31:23] <mojtaba1> tandroid: It points to line 607, I did what you said though.
[16:33:07] <tandroid> Yeah, that definitely looks wrong :)
[16:33:29] <tandroid> what are the double [[ and ]] for?
[16:36:01] <mojtaba1> tandroid: thanks. It is fixed now. The last question is that how can I check the data variables? with for loop?
[16:36:42] <mojtaba1> tandroid: In the console it just shows [object Object]  (Is there any difference between object and Object?!)
[16:37:26] <robertmaxrees> it's telling you the type and what it is.
[16:37:29] <robertmaxrees> nothing to worry about.
[16:38:47] <tandroid> mojtaba1: you want to know what's in the data variable?
[16:39:04] <mojtaba1> tandroid: yes, to check it
[16:40:00] <tandroid> Is your console log outputting what you expect?
[16:40:13] <tandroid> Or do you mean to loop over each value and check it?
[16:40:59] <mojtaba1> tandroid: the console just shows it is object
[16:42:10] <tandroid> Sorry I have to go mojtaba1
[16:42:24] <mojtaba1> tandroid: thanks for your help
[16:44:38] <robertmaxrees> what's going on here?
[16:49:26] <theCole> #angularjs
[16:53:39] <uncovery> guys can someone do me the favor and click on the JS snippet on the bottom of this and tell me which days are highlighted? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31270845/jquery-datepicker-displays-wrong-dates
[16:54:51] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:55:24] <robertmaxrees> http://i.imgur.com/DpQ6a6M.png
[16:55:25] <robertmaxrees> this?
[16:55:35] <uncovery> there seems to be an issue with  yes
[16:55:38] <uncovery> yes this
[16:56:01] <uncovery> for me it shows like this: http://i.stack.imgur.com/T1lou.png
[16:56:22] <uncovery> because I am in asia
[16:56:22] <robertmaxrees> off by one on each.
[16:56:23] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[16:56:29] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[16:56:31] <robertmaxrees> localization issue?
[16:57:53] <uncovery> well seems like. the issue is that a date is a date. since datepicker works with dateobjects and they switch date when you are in a different timezone
[16:58:09] <uncovery> looks like a bug to me
[16:58:31] <robertmaxrees> that looks like a localization issue to me.
[16:58:39] <robertmaxrees> feel free to bring it up with the jquery-ui team.
[16:59:19] <uncovery> so when I want to let someone pick their birthday, how can they pick the right date? if they are asian and pick the 27th, and it ends up being the 26th?
[16:59:36] <robertmaxrees> did you set the proper localization in jquery-ui?
[16:59:55] <uncovery> let me check
[16:59:59] <uncovery> likely not then
[17:00:07] <robertmaxrees> there's an extra file you need to include
[17:02:07] <uncovery> the the jquery-ui-i18n.min.js ?
[17:02:30] <uncovery> can you point me to any documentation on this?
[17:03:39] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[17:03:49] <robertmaxrees> section titled "Localization"
[17:06:09] <uncovery> hmmm that's languages and date formats... not timezones?
[17:07:00] <robertmaxrees> try it first.
[17:07:02] <robertmaxrees> see if it fixes things.
[17:09:46] <uncovery> I am not sure what to do there. I want an english calendar. English is an official language in Hong Kong. You suggest switching the calendar to Chinese?
[17:16:53] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea then - i'd submit something to the JQUI team then.
[17:17:03] <uncovery> yeah will do thanks
[17:17:29] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11571557/jquery-ui-datepicker-multiple-language-integration
[17:17:37] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you could do something like this maybe?
[17:45:56] <mojtaba1> Does anybody know how to select all inputs inside a div with specific id?  $("div :text") works, but $("div#id :text") does not work
[17:46:24] <mojtaba1> $("#id :text") also does not work.
[17:48:49] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:48:54] <robertmaxrees> #id :input
[17:49:09] <robertmaxrees> you don't have multiple divs with the same ID, right?
[17:49:57] <jak2000> http://jsfiddle.net/megmLd4a/10/    my regexp is invalid (not work) i need accept only numbers, anyone can test the fiddle, and see if type in second input text a number it was validated and always say Invalid qty2 any adivce how to fix?
[17:50:03] <jak2000> robertmaxrees can you test?
[17:50:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:50:22] <robertmaxrees> what's your question?  only allow numbers?
[17:50:26] <jak2000> yes
[17:51:35] <mojtaba1> robertmaxrees: ("#id :text") also does not work too
[17:51:39] <robertmaxrees> :input
[17:51:42] <robertmaxrees> not :text
[17:51:58] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 /^\d+$/g
[17:52:14] <mojtaba1> robertmaxrees: that one is also not working
[17:52:19] <robertmaxrees> show me then.
[17:52:25] <robertmaxrees> because it sounds like you have invalid HTML.
[17:52:33] <mojtaba1> robertmaxrees: check this page
[17:52:34] <mojtaba1> http://www.kabobhutcanada.com/test11/form-menu
[17:52:49] <mojtaba1> robertmaxrees: in your console type: console.log(jQuery("#food_list :input"));
[17:52:51] <robertmaxrees> ...
[17:53:07] <robertmaxrees> your html is invalid.
[17:53:15] <mojtaba1> robertmaxrees: why is that?
[17:53:18] <robertmaxrees> you cannot have a div inside a table like that.
[17:53:32] <robertmaxrees> move it outside or give the table the id.
[17:54:01] <mojtaba1> robertmaxrees: But I need some part of the table
[17:54:08] <mojtaba1> robertmaxrees: how can I achieve it?
[17:54:18] <robertmaxrees> you cannot wrap them in divs.
[17:54:23] <robertmaxrees> use common classes on the TRs.
[17:54:33] <robertmaxrees> or separate tables.
[17:54:34] <robertmaxrees> ooorrr..
[17:54:38] <robertmaxrees> anything but what you're doing.
[17:54:53] <mojtaba1> robertmaxrees: thank you very much for your help
[17:54:57] <mojtaba1> robertmaxrees: I will fix it
[17:57:22] <jak2000> robertmaxrees done!!!
[17:57:23] <jak2000> thx
[18:07:59] <pyCasso> need help getting line 36 to execute before the ajax completed http://jsbin.com/vadacobede/edit?html,js
[18:08:36] <pyCasso> in live environment. the active class isn't applied until after ajax is completed.
[18:09:08] <pyCasso> the active class should be applied immediately after click event. What am i missing?
[18:46:25] <acidjazz> there an easy way in jquery to remove all classes that match a regex ors omething
[18:46:27] <acidjazz> regex*
[18:52:54] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: On one element?
[18:54:15] <acidjazz> yea
[18:54:46] <acidjazz> i did this
[18:54:47] <acidjazz>     $('.definition').attr('class', $('.definition').attr('class').replace(/\bfilter_.*?\b/g, ''));
[18:54:57] <acidjazz> kinda ghetto
[18:56:02] <arc_> seems like that's probably the best way to do it
[18:56:13] <BillCriswell> acidjazz: You can pass a function to attr.
[18:56:42] <BillCriswell> and the arguments passed are the index and class name.
[18:57:12] <BillCriswell> so like.. $('.foo').attr('class', function (index, className) { return className.replace(); });
[18:57:36] <BillCriswell> maybe use prop instead of class... i manage to always pick the wrong one, though.
[19:31:33] <antons> greetings guys, can some1 please help me
[19:31:40] <antons> im willing to compensate for time
[19:31:52] <antons> i need webshell to open telnet session to ip on user click
[19:32:09] <antons> i heard jquery UI can do that
[19:57:01] <FreezingDroid> What's wrong with this line? document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = $(".text").load("myfile.txt");
[19:58:33] <FreezingDroid> I just get [object Object] as my output
[20:02:04] <rcyr> FreezingDroid: You probably need to assign to 'content' in the callback of the .load function
[20:02:36] <FreezingDroid> rcyr: I have a <div id="content"></div> right before in my HTML body.
[20:02:54] <rcyr> Sure, but it's .load that is async.
[20:03:48] <FreezingDroid> Oh.
[20:03:50] <FreezingDroid> How would I fix that?
[20:04:08] <rcyr> FreezingDroid: So, it probably needs to look like var text = $(".text"); text.load("myfile.txt", function() {document.getElementById('content').innerHTML = text.text(); }); or something similatr
[20:05:36] <rcyr> I'm just not sure why you need to have the content twice in the page
[20:06:18] <FreezingDroid> rcyr: still does nothing
[20:07:22] <FreezingDroid> hold on, I'll post the whole thing.
[20:07:25] <rcyr> Ok
[20:08:05] <FreezingDroid> rcyr: http://sprunge.us/jHDA
[20:10:05] <rcyr> Nothing "looks" wrong with your code.
[20:10:15] <rcyr> Hmm
[20:10:26] <rcyr> Where is the <div class="text"></div> element?
[20:10:50] <rcyr> Ok... let's restart from scratch
[20:10:54] <rcyr> What do you want to do?
[20:11:50] <FreezingDroid> ryanneufeld: never mind, got it :)
[20:11:54] <FreezingDroid> Thanks.
[20:33:06] <mojtaba1> Do you know how can I transfer more than one array of data using ajax to php file?
[20:35:50] <tw2113> pass an array of arrays
[20:36:13] <mojtaba1> tw2113: thx
[20:43:34] <acidjazz> [[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[[]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]
[20:43:44] <acidjazz> i held those down.. wonder if itll lint
[20:44:15] <acidjazz> hah! its correct!
[20:44:26] <acidjazz> what luck eh
[21:02:15] <tw2113> have any more of them arrays acidjazz ?
[22:01:34] <sebbers_> if i have a float such as 35.00 or 35.04 how can i check if the floats decimal point numbers are all zeros or not...regex?
[22:18:53] <monk3y> sebbers: you could do that, or see if; amount == Math.floor(amount) (35.00 == 35.00, 35.01 != 35.00)
[22:21:28] <monk3y> Although you might want to check if there's any float precision inaccuracies that could affect Math.floor() :/
[23:54:59] <mdev> does
[23:55:17] <mdev> ${'.whatever').removeClass('whatever');
[23:55:21] <mdev> do it for all classes?
[23:55:27] <mdev> or just first one found
[23:57:15] <Cork> ?api removeClass
[23:57:15] <b-ot> Cork: .removeClass(): Remove a single class, multiple classes, or all classes from each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/removeClass/
