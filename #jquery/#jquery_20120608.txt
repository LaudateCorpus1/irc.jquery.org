[00:01:32] <Back2Basics> Generally when you execute an .ajax call what (value/object) are you wanting returned?
[00:10:33] <Ghost1227> I'm getting an 'Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier' error on the following code: http://pastebin.com/X3sa9m4D can anyone give me a thought as to where the problem is?
[00:12:26] <Kim__> y
[00:12:59] <Cork> Ghost1227: check what code it generates instead of your php code
[00:13:20] <Cork> Ghost1227: then it will most likely be obvious
[00:21:03] <ckoning> Does anyone know how to write into a new style tag?
[00:21:39] <ckoning> I've added a tag to the head DOM element: var style = $("<style></style>").appendTo($("head"));
[00:22:11] <ckoning> But IE 8 craps out on writing: $(style).html(URLDecode(json.css));
[00:22:27] <Ghost1227> Cork: problem is, it seems to generate all expected code...
[00:25:17] <Cork> Ghost1227: could you pb the generated js?
[00:31:32] <Ghost1227> Cork: found it... it was a sql error
[01:00:17] <rethus> is following process possible:
[01:02:13] <rethus> 1) load html-table via ajax (in one td-field is a Link, that use bootstrap twitter-popup, which needs to init)
[01:02:13] <rethus> 2) generate the JS-Init-Sourcecode via php and send it back via ajax to requesting document...
[01:02:13] <rethus> 3) execute the JS-init Sourcecode to init the popup
[01:03:42] <rethus> ahh, have a better solution... often it helps to talk about it ;)
[01:04:33] <tocka> morning
[01:08:17] <tocka> Maybe someone can help me out with http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10945020/jquery-validation-counting-date ?
[01:12:10] <clb_> with the code $('.copy'), I can find all the elements in the page with class 'copy', but how would I query all elements of class 'copy' under an element with id '#copyables'?
[01:12:37] <clb_> i.e. the classes would be allowed to be immediate children of #copyables, or grandchildren
[01:12:46] <runvnc> rethus: put the twitter js stuff in the main window
[01:14:04] <rethus> runvnc: thats not possible, cause the filter are generated dynamicly.. but i have a solution... each filter got an id.. so i return only this id, and create the whole  popupBox stuff via js instead of php
[01:15:08] <firedfox_> clb_: $('#copyables > .copy') and read this http://api.jquery.com/child-selector/
[01:15:40] <clb_> just what I'm looking for. Thanks!
[01:15:57] <runvnc> tocka: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[01:16:12] <firedfox_> clb_: if grandchildren allowed, just use this $('#copyables .copy')
[01:16:39] <runvnc> You need to pull the day month and year out of the selects using .val() and then use the date constructor
[01:16:41] <firedfox_> clb_: np.
[01:16:43] <runvnc> tocka
[01:17:46] <runvnc> rethus I think I don't understand the problem.. maybe you can jsfiddle it.. you are saying that you need to dynamically generate the javascript, but after the page loads?
[01:18:04] <rethus> ajax
[01:19:04] <runvnc> instead of doing this, just include the JS source code in the <head> 2) generate the JS-Init-Sourcecode via php and send it back via ajax to requesting document
[01:19:18] <runvnc> why do you need to generate js init sourcecode what is that
[01:19:23] <runvnc> can you jsfiddle it
[01:24:01] <tocka> runvnc but lets say if Im pulling each option for selectboxes with .val
[01:24:06] <tocka> can I merge them somehow?
[01:24:14] <runvnc> I said use the Date constructor
[01:24:17] <runvnc> new Date(
[01:24:25] <runvnc> did you read the mdn link to Date
[01:24:47] <tocka> yeah I did, but this is what Iv found
[01:24:48] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/58PZAS0r
[01:25:13] <tocka> This is exactly what I need, but the difference is its getting the date from an input and not from select boxes
[01:26:12] <runvnc> you need to pull the month, year and date values out of the selects
[01:26:19] <runvnc> then pass those parameters to the Date constructor
[01:26:26] <runvnc> so if you don't know what that means
[01:26:40] <runvnc> then this is a good exercise to learn about Javascript and basic terminology
[01:27:00] <runvnc> have you done any programming before tocka
[01:27:45] <tocka> yup
[01:28:10] <dean[w]> Morning all. I'm following the events "pattern (?) outlined here: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Events In my init method, im looping as in the example, and inside of there im binding events. However, I want to trigger one of the other methods in this event. The use-case is im making a slider, and the slider has pages. I want to init the events for clicking on a page link and have it
[01:28:10] <dean[w]> call a changePage method which changes the page. This method should also be available to call as part of the plugin e.g. $("#obj").mySlider("changePage", 2);
[01:28:26] <granden> Hi, If I want a menu like this site got, http://mi.nba.com/_touch/ at the bottom. Is it jquery mobile I need ?
[01:28:51] <dean[w]> pastebin here: http://pastebin.com/NG822yvw
[01:29:34] <Zitter> good morning, is there an extension/plugin to create and manage graph like this one: http://i55.tinypic.com/2yk0wzk.png ?
[01:29:59] <dean[w]> So essentially i am trying to trigger $("#obj").slider("changePage", 2); from within the init function :)
[01:30:26] <xec> Zitter: something like this? http://raphaeljs.com/graffle.html
[01:31:48] <Zitter> xec, wow :) yes like that... with functionalities to add/edit node :)
[01:32:03] <matt1982> hmm i have a php application that adds an onlick="doSomething(300)"  to a table row. the 300 is an id that is different every row. I was told that this is bad form. However I cant think of an easier way to do it in jqueyr alone. Can anyone suggest a way or is it ok to do the onclick?
[01:33:29] <xec> Zitter: i haven't used it myself, but looks like a start at least. dunno how easy it is to extend, google found me this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5599833/adding-custom-remove-method-to-raphael-js-graffle-connection
[01:34:08] <Zitter> xec, thanks for help me :)
[01:34:57] <xec> Zitter: other options here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3944723/javascript-flowchart-flow-diagram-lib
[01:36:35] <Zitter> very useful, too much stuff on the net for me!
[01:37:01] <ribot> hey
[01:37:03] <niels__> yo krismeld
[01:37:14] <runvnc> dean[w], are you sure you don't just want to put the first section inside of the second one
[01:37:39] <runvnc> like all of that inside of $.fn.dcSlider
[01:38:30] <ribot> i'm trying to submit a form any time there is a change on any of its inputs, but i don't get my code to trigger when i click a child input: $(".submit_onchange").children().filter(":input").change(function()...
[01:38:50] <ribot> click a checkbox that is
[01:39:08] <xec> matt1982: what you can do is attach the number to the element using a data attribute, like data-mynumber="300" and then you can do something like $("[data-mynumber]").click(function(){ alert("my number is: " + $(this).data("mynumber"); })
[01:39:20] <legoney> Has anyone been using pjax? I want to set the title with another method than <title> because the pages are the same with or without the surrounding design (that already has a title element). It can be set with "HTML fragments" but I cant figure out what that means.
[01:40:03] <matt1982> xec ooh so add my own attribute to the row?  is there a name for that I can google to find out more?
[01:40:47] <runvnc> dean[w], put the html in here http://jsfiddle.net/HWS4S/1/
[01:40:55] <xec> matt1982: hm, i'd just google "html data attribute" but this is a nice post: http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
[01:41:10] <dean[w]> runvnc, the html in this case makes no difference. what im trying to do is logical
[01:41:28] <xec> matt1982: don't worry about the "html5" part, it'll work in any browser you care about
[01:41:30] <dean[w]> manually call a plugin method from within another, simples :)
[01:41:42] <matt1982> xec awesome thanks.
[01:41:50] <runvnc> dean if its simple then why are you asking how to do it?
[01:41:57] <runvnc> I don't see any plugins in that code you gave
[01:42:13] <matt1982> that's brilliant xec really nice feature! many thanks
[01:42:13] <runvnc> it looks like a start of plugin and then methods in a separate thing
[01:42:20] <xec> matt1982: you're welcome :)
[01:46:19] <martisj> does $(this) jump into the dom and "find" the element?
[01:46:23] <martisj> or is it cached?
[01:46:53] <martisj> learning to optimize jquery code atm
[01:48:09] <runvnc> No it doesn't find it
[01:48:13] <runvnc> the reason I know that is
[01:48:23] <runvnc> if you add elements after jquery initialized
[01:48:40] <runvnc> wait
[01:48:44] <runvnc> nevermind I am wrong
[01:49:07] <runvnc> I don't think it finds them though, I think it has an object that uses the selector or something
[01:49:39] <xec> martisj: what is "this" in that context?
[01:49:50] <runvnc> martisj is there a particular page you are trying to optimize
[01:49:51] <martisj> xec: an anon function
[01:50:02] <martisj> runvnc: live page?
[01:50:15] <martisj> i'll fiddle it
[01:50:27] <xec> martisj: that doesn't really tell me anything. is is an event handler?
[01:50:38] <martisj> xec: ah.. yes :)
[01:50:39] <martisj> hahahah
[01:50:40] <martisj> sorry
[01:50:43] <runvnc> martisj are you noticing a performance problem in your page, and if so what browsers have you tried
[01:51:12] <xec> martisj: ok, then most likely "this" is going to be the DOM element that triggered your handler
[01:51:16] <martisj> http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/wBEwF/
[01:51:23] <martisj> runvnc: chrome.
[01:51:28] <martisj> it doesn't animate is first,
[01:51:35] <martisj> but i don't know if it's the jquery
[01:51:43] <martisj> it's not working quite as expected either.
[01:51:46] <runvnc> what does that mean it doesnt animate is first?
[01:51:55] <martisj> at first
[01:51:58] <runvnc> I don't understand what the performance problem is
[01:52:26] <runvnc> martisj can you paste the html in that jsfiddle
[01:52:47] <martisj> well, the script is meant to scroll (with animation) to a specific item, and when i click. The animation doesn't run and the browser get's scrolled to the point with a jerk
[01:53:10] <runvnc> I doubt that is actually a jquery performance problem martisj
[01:53:15] <runvnc> How many items are there?
[01:53:26] <runvnc> Can you put the html in the fiddle, otherwise there is no point in making the fiddle
[01:54:27] <BinaryKitten> martisj http://jsfiddle.net/wBEwF/1/ is a better performing version
[01:54:30] <martisj> runvnc: yes sir
[01:54:31] <martisj> hang on.
[01:55:14] <runvnc> martisj I don't see any animation in that just a scrollto
[01:55:37] <martisj> there is a slight problem though. It wouldn't be a valid test case because the dev who wrote it used a plugin
[01:55:47] <martisj> scrollto isn't a native jquery function is it?
[01:56:03] <martisj> http://jsfiddle.net/martisj/wBEwF/2/
[01:56:31] <martisj> BinaryKitten: thanks :)
[01:56:36] <BinaryKitten> martisj no it is'nt
[01:57:07] <martisj> BinaryKitten: no it isn't a native function, or no martisj you're it isn't not a native function?
[01:57:40] <BinaryKitten> urm the former
[01:57:47] <BinaryKitten> i completely don't understand the latter
[01:57:55] <martisj> BinaryKitten: double negation.
[01:58:09] <BinaryKitten> http://demos.flesler.com/jquery/scrollTo/
[01:59:19] <martisj> yeah that's the one i'm using i think
[01:59:27] <martisj> i'll try implementing your version BinaryKitten
[01:59:42] <globe_tmp> hi guys
[02:00:06] <globe_tmp> is there a way to execute a js fonction after all html have been load and after all the js have veen executed
[02:01:21] <BinaryKitten> yes
[02:01:43] <BinaryKitten> use $(document).ready and put your js function AFTER all the rest of hte code
[02:02:41] <globe_tmp> BinaryKitten: i got some html that is dynamiclly build by my js code ,  i want to execute the js after all the ajax call have ben executed
[02:03:58] <martisj> globe_tmp: are you using the success event?
[02:04:09] <martisj> ajax{ success: function() {}}
[02:04:33] <globe_tmp> martisj: yes
[02:06:04] * BinaryKitten needs to go lay down again
[02:07:05] <martisj> BinaryKitten: why come?
[02:07:11] <martisj> globe_tmp: and that isn't working?
[02:07:21] <martisj> that should run when all the html has been returned.
[02:07:29] <martisj> sorry that's wrong
[02:07:43] <martisj> jsfiddle it
[02:08:00] <sacho> globe_tmp, see deferred and promises
[02:08:09] <globe_tmp> sacho: !
[02:12:05] <globe_tmp> martisj: thanks for you help , my code is complex and it call some webservice behind firewall ...   it gonna hard to jsfiddleit
[02:12:06] <globe_tmp> thanks
[02:12:24] <martisj> globe_tmp: np
[02:18:30] <diverdude> Hey guys, anybody knows how i can underline specific text in a textarea?
[02:18:41] <Robbington> Hi I seem to be having a wierd issue using .remove(); of a span.
[02:20:11] <Cork> Robbington: define weird
[02:20:21] <Cork> diverdude: you can't
[02:20:41] <Cork> diverdude: you would have to use contentEditable if you want to style it
[02:20:41] <diverdude> Corey: hmm how does those rich text editors for web then work?
[02:21:18] <diverdude> contentEditable is html5 right?
[02:21:18] <krismeld> is it possible to insert <h1> tags in middle of text string that is inside a div?
[02:21:24] <Robbington> Cork: Here is a pastebin, remove isnt removing the element http://pastebin.com/yGh3mPjB
[02:21:24] <Cork> diverdude: no
[02:21:37] <Flo0815> krismeld: sure
[02:21:47] <Flo0815> but i'lll add linebreaks
[02:21:50] <Cork> diverdude: its an OLD ie defenition, that all browsers has supported out of spec up until html5
[02:22:14] <Flo0815> so add display: inline; as css to your h1
[02:22:24] <krismeld> ok, ty
[02:23:07] <krismeld> so if i know the specific word inside the string that i want wrapped in the tags, how do i do it?
[02:23:31] <diverdude> Cork: is it difficult to use contentEditable for underlining specific words? And can that be combined with the auto-row increase you helped me with earlier?
[02:23:47] <Cork> krismeld: search the text and replace the word with a wrapped tag
[02:24:11] <Cork> diverdude: no its not hard <div contentEditable="true"></div>
[02:24:22] <krismeld> thank you, will try it out right now
[02:24:29] <Cork> diverdude: the hard part is getting it to act as a form element, as its not
[02:25:10] <diverdude> Cork: ahh yes ok...how can that be done?
[02:25:23] <diverdude> by copying its content to a hidden field b4 submit?
[02:25:39] <Cork> diverdude: if your using ajax, grabbing the content from the div
[02:26:02] <Cork> diverdude: if your using normal form submit storing the div content in a textarea before submitting
[02:26:09] <diverdude> Cork: yeah...hehe well but im using an ajax-form plugin, so that i can submit a form via ajax
[02:26:09] <Cork> (hidden('
[02:26:12] <Cork> *(hidden)
[02:26:32] <Cork> ?.serialize @ diverdude
[02:26:34] <bot-t> diverdude, .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[02:26:35] <Cork> ?.serializeArray @ diverdude
[02:26:35] <bot-t> diverdude, .serializeArray(): Encode a set of form elements as an array of names and values. http://api.jquery.com/serializeArray/
[02:26:38] <diverdude> Cork: why a textarea? why not just a hidden input field
[02:26:57] <Cork> diverdude: i THINK they can't hold line breaks
[02:27:05] <diverdude> ahh
[02:27:07] <Cork> but not completly sure
[02:28:47] <diverdude> Cork: so in <div contentEditable="true"></div>, underline is done using css? so each word is encapsulated in a span or how?
[02:28:59] <Cork> exactly
[02:29:24] <diverdude> aha, and how are white spaces handled?
[02:30:01] <Cork> contentEditable doesn't matter there
[02:30:06] <diverdude> converted to &nbsp; ?
[02:30:35] <fdv> Hi. in smartclient, there's a stretchimg widget that uses three images to create a button (or something similar), with a start image, a center image and an end image. Only the center image is then stretched. does anybody know of a jquery widget that does the same?
[02:31:24] <Flo0815> Cork: can u help me why this isn't working on safari? i want to have custom designed file-upload-buttons: -http://jsfiddle.net/6zeRn/3/
[02:31:33] <diverdude> i mean, should it be like : <div contentEditable="true"> <span>foo</span>&nbsp;<span style="font-size:16px">bar</span>&npsp;</div>?
[02:31:49] <martisj> anybody used inview function?
[02:31:58] <martisj> can't find any documentation on it
[02:32:06] <martisj> and this is some weird ass code i've got
[02:33:37] <diverdude> Cork: ^
[02:34:17] <Cork> Flo0815: that you can get anything working that way surprises me, browsers normally block access to the content for input type file
[02:34:32] <Flo0815> ff, IE no problems
[02:34:39] <Cork> diverdude: that depends on css white-space
[02:35:00] <Flo0815> but ithought of that already that safari is blocking this
[02:35:08] <Flo0815> any idea how can i get it to work?
[02:35:23] <diverdude> Cork: in what sense?
[02:35:29] <Cork> Flo0815:  what part is it you want to access?
[02:35:34] <Cork> ?mdc white-space @ diverdude
[02:35:37] <bot-t> diverdude, white-space - MDN - The white-space CSS property is used to to describe how whitespace inside the element is handled. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/white-space
[02:35:53] <Flo0815> i want a custom designed upload button
[02:36:02] <Flo0815> thats all
[02:36:10] <nodie> hi
[02:36:14] <Cork> Flo0815: flash
[02:36:23] <Cork> Flo0815: not possible in browsers as far as i know
[02:36:27] <Flo0815> but as far as i know you cant design a input type =file"
[02:36:33] <Cork> nope
[02:36:42] <Cork> and you can't trigger the file pick dialog from js
[02:36:56] <diverdude> Cork: ahh so set to pre
[02:36:58] <Flo0815> i IE and FF i can
[02:37:12] <Cork> Flo0815: hmm, so its landed in ff, forgot that
[02:37:20] <Cork> you couldn't a few months back
[02:37:24] <Flo0815> ok
[02:37:43] <Cork> anyway the only cross browser none plugin based solution that i've seen working
[02:37:47] <Flo0815> maybe it's possible to set the input opacity to 0?
[02:37:58] <Cork> is by making the input element transparent and showing what you want behinde it
[02:38:04] <Flo0815> :)
[02:38:07] <Flo0815> same idea
[02:38:16] <Flo0815> ok i'll try that
[02:38:20] <Flo0815> thanks so far
[02:38:44] <martisj> is there a inview javascript/jquery event?
[02:39:19] <Cork> martisj: no
[02:39:35] <BinaryKitten> Flo0815  - I've updated your code for jQuery 1.7.2 and performance
[02:39:36] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/6zeRn/4/
[02:39:39] <martisj> Cork: okay, is there a way to trace where the event is coming from?
[02:39:40] <Cork> martisj: theres no souch event in dom
[02:39:53] <martisj> Cork: thanks, that's what i thought
[02:39:58] <Cork> martisj: sure, event.target
[02:40:59] <martisj> Cork: i have a slight problem, i can see that our code says bind('inview'...... i want to know what this event is?.... when it's triggered?
[02:41:08] <martisj> can i do that with event.target?
[02:42:21] <Cork> martisj: what the even is?
[02:42:35] <Cork> ah, you mean you bind multible types in the same handler=
[02:42:37] <Cork> *?
[02:42:40] <martisj> I must rephrase my question.
[02:43:01] <martisj>             $('#public-header .logo').bind('inview', function(event, iV, vpX, vpY) {                 if (iV) {
[02:43:12] <martisj> i am wondering what the heck iV is ...
[02:43:17] <martisj> and the other args
[02:43:35] <Cork> martisj: search in your library tree for what does trigger('inview'
[02:44:18] <martisj>  library tree?
[02:44:32] <Cork> your .js files
[02:44:45] <Cork> the set of dependencies you have
[02:44:55] <martisj> aha
[02:44:55] <Flo0815> Crok: it worked. parent div: position: relative; input: position absolute; input tpe=file: opacity: 0; and done
[02:45:11] <martisj> it seemes the scrollto plugin has an inview thign
[02:45:28] <krismeld> is it not possible to wrap a specific word that is in the middle of a textstring in <h1> on (window).resize event by using replace() ? it prints out the <h1> as if it is just normal characters in the string…
[02:45:28] <Cork> Flo0815: yup, its a nasty hack, but it works quite well
[02:45:44] <Cork> martisj: there you go
[02:45:53] <martisj> Cork: thanks :D
[02:45:57] <Cork> np
[02:46:54] <Cork> Krinkle: parent.html(parent.html().replace('string', '<h1>string</h1>'));

[02:48:39] <SugaSlide> any way to get jquery ui draggable to be "live"
[02:48:59] <SugaSlide> like any matching element that gets added to the dom later on also gets it?
[02:49:07] <SugaSlide> like a good mafia movie lol...
[02:49:14] <krismeld> thanks Cork
[02:49:17] <Lope> Hi, I'm a jQuery noob. why is this fadeIn and fadeOut not working? http://pastebin.com/zAF6MwJT
[02:50:09] <SugaSlide>  if (v=='visible') $(category + 'P').fadeIn(1000);
[02:50:17] <SugaSlide> if its visible it must become visible?
[02:50:19] <Flo0815> $('' category + 'P')
[02:50:21] <SugaSlide> AND
[02:50:22] <Flo0815>  oh sry
[02:50:29] <Flo0815> $('#' + category + 'P')
[02:51:23] <Cork> ?.fadeToggle @ Lope
[02:51:24] <bot-t> Lope, .fadeToggle([duration], [easing], [callback]): Display or hide the matched elements by animating their opacity. http://api.jquery.com/fadeToggle/
[02:51:34] <krismeld> TY TY cork, now it works, have spent 4 hours on this
[02:51:36] <SugaSlide> var $category =  $('#' + category + 'P'); if ($category.is(":visible")){ $category.fadeOut(100); } else {
[02:51:46] <SugaSlide> or use faadeToggle :P
[02:52:01] <Flo0815> u r missing the #, Lope
[02:52:42] <SugaSlide> isnt it more the
[02:52:50] <SugaSlide> if visible then fadeIn
[02:53:14] <SugaSlide> nvm
[02:53:21] <Lope> Flo0815: not working buddy
[02:53:35] <Lope> http://pastebin.com/jzxH9H7L
[02:53:54] <SugaSlide> Lope your code is all kinds of crazy
[02:53:54] <diverdude> how do i make a div visible which has no content ? (it has a border)
[02:54:01] <SugaSlide> get rid of your js in the html
[02:54:15] <Lope> I know, its not my code, someone just asked me to hack it quick
[02:54:47] <Lope> what are the requirements for a fadein?
[02:54:49] <SugaSlide> drop a console.log() in there
[02:54:56] <SugaSlide> display:none
[02:54:59] <Lope> must it be visibility hidden before you fadein?
[02:55:05] <BinaryKitten> Flo0815 did you see the upgrade to youre code i did for you?
[02:55:12] <Lope> display none? not visibility hidden?
[02:55:21] <SugaSlide> display none
[02:55:38] <SugaSlide> for visibility you probs need to animate opacity
[02:57:37] <endberg> hi
[02:57:44] <diverdude> how do i make a div visible which has no content ? (it has a border)
[02:58:03] <Flo0815> BinaryKitten: where?
[02:58:16] <Flo0815> oh yeah
[02:58:19] <BinaryKitten> http://jsfiddle.net/6zeRn/4/
[02:58:21] <Flo0815> ok ill check it out
[02:58:35] <endberg> I'd like to know, is there any jquery selection method to select the hidden part of a div overflow=hidden? (the clipped part)
[02:58:35] <BinaryKitten> it removes un-required dom traversal
[02:58:55] <Flo0815> ok i try to understand what's hapening
[02:58:56] <Flo0815> :)
[02:58:59] <BinaryKitten> and uses vars as needed to avoid global catastrophes
[03:01:22] <diverdude> how do i make a div visible which has no content ? i have specified width:100% and height:2em;
[03:01:30] <Flo0815> BinaryKitten: whats happening in this line: $collection.on('click', '.fakeinput', function(){; does it execute the following function on every .fakeinput-element? or only the corresponding to the "real" input?
[03:01:58] <Flo0815> diverdude: use px for height and witdth
[03:02:01] <BinaryKitten> it's the same as what you had before with the live
[03:02:09] <diverdude> :/
[03:02:12] <BinaryKitten> but .live as been deprecated in 1.7
[03:02:58] <BinaryKitten> so you say, hey mr parent.. whenever someone clicks on your children, if that child matches this selector, do this thing here
[03:03:23] <BinaryKitten> .live did the same thing except it set the parent to be the whole document
[03:03:36] <Flo0815> ok but this works only if theres only 1 "collection", right?
[03:04:08] <BinaryKitten> well yes, but you could switch out $('#collection') to $(document)
[03:04:22] <Lope> whats a good way to see variable values besides alert() which causes user interface disruption?
[03:04:30] <Flo0815> console.log
[03:04:30] <BinaryKitten> Lope console.log?
[03:04:37] <vespakoen> hey guys, im having some animations in different places, and i dont like to pass through callback functions all over the place, would it be possible to make some kind of TaskQueue? if so, how would this work?
[03:04:46] <Flo0815> Lope: ever heard of firebug?
[03:05:00] <Flo0815> vespakoen: $.queue()
[03:05:13] <Flo0815> but it's only for one element
[03:05:14] <Robbington> k, this is stumping me. I have a function that creates a <p><span>text<a>click</a></p> then a live click bound the the a that removes the parent <p> but it doesnt. Any help?
[03:05:18] <BinaryKitten> Flo0815 not just firebug... but chrome tools, opera dragonfly, firefox inspector, IE tools
[03:05:27] <Flo0815> yeah, ok
[03:05:29] <Flo0815> :)
[03:05:42] <Flo0815> i'm using firebug and i'm happy
[03:05:45] <Lope> Flo0815: using firebug, but it hasn't been very good about giving me jQuery errors
[03:05:51] <Flo0815> ?
[03:05:54] <Lope> running firefox 15 and latest firebug.
[03:06:05] <Lope> BinaryKitten: thanks for the console.log. awesome.
[03:06:42] <BinaryKitten> Lope http://getfirebug.com/wiki/index.php/Console_API
[03:06:44] <Flo0815> vespakoen: if you want to queue animations on multiple elements, it's getting hard. I'm working on a project right now and it's driving me insane
[03:06:57] <BinaryKitten> there's a whole plethora of nice parts in that you can use
[03:07:02] <vespakoen> Flo0815, hehe
[03:07:09] <vespakoen> guess ill just throw around object then =P
[03:07:14] <Flo0815> :)
[03:07:22] <vespakoen> callback -> callback -> callback ... INCEPTION =')
[03:07:28] <Flo0815> yeah :)
[03:07:33] <vespakoen> fuck me
[03:07:39] <BinaryKitten> language please
[03:07:50] <Flo0815> but i don't know how many animations there are, cause there in a user editable XML file
[03:07:59] <vespakoen> I was talking to myself =P
[03:08:07] <BinaryKitten> out loud.
[03:08:09] <vespakoen> XML, really, that stuff still exists?
[03:08:15] <Flo0815> sure
[03:08:21] <vespakoen> BinaryKitten, sorry mate =) i'll behave
[03:08:31] <vespakoen> sounds like a fun project
[03:08:34] <BinaryKitten> lol @ being "mate"-ed again
[03:08:44] <vespakoen> if i would run into that, i would turn around and never stop running =P
[03:09:11] <vespakoen> BinaryKitten, was that inappropiate?
[03:09:23] <Archer_xda> vespakoen - XML is everywhere.  You can't escape it
[03:09:42] <Flo0815> everytime i head(or read) "behave" it reminds me of Austin Powers
[03:10:03] <BinaryKitten> vespakoen no, just comical that's all
[03:10:26] <BinaryKitten> you don't know how many times i get called "mate" or "Bro" or some sort of male referenced banter term
[03:10:37] <vespakoen> yeh, we all love eachother =)
[03:10:38] <Flo0815> cool story, bro! ;)
[03:11:26] <dean[w]> mate is not gender-specific
[03:11:33] <dean[w]> 'lo BinaryKitten :)
[03:11:40] <BinaryKitten> dean[w] it is in the north of England
[03:11:47] <dean[w]> Not in the middle, where I'm from :)
[03:11:49] <Jagan_> I got an issue .. if i click any where in my page, button color is automatically change to white?
[03:11:58] <BinaryKitten> dean[w] brum?
[03:12:05] <dean[w]> aye, you sold me the phpelepahtn :)
[03:12:27] <BinaryKitten> that was good 3 years ago
[03:12:29] <BinaryKitten> if not more
[03:12:30] <dean[w]> it was :)
[03:12:37] <Archer_xda> jagan : URL?
[03:12:41] * BinaryKitten has moved 3 times since hten
[03:12:45] <Archer_xda> jagan_ : URL?
[03:13:03] <dean[w]> It's sadly at home in Brum now :( Almost 2000km away
[03:13:20] <BinaryKitten> Jagan_ inspect the element, look for class changes etc
[03:13:34] <BinaryKitten> then inspect for code that changes the class
[03:15:04] <Robbington> Ok, better question why would assigning varibles from $(this) stop .remove from working?
[03:15:06] <Flo0815> bsic question: how can i organize ajax requests in a good way? i have a CRM-like webapp with lots of ajax calls
[03:15:51] <tocka> Just wanted to ask, why is my form being submited only when I press <submit> button 2 times, I mean first time nothing happens, 2nd time it submits
[03:15:52] <tocka> http://pastebin.com/UFm7tkqM
[03:17:18] <Flo0815> tocka: is there some html?
[03:17:21] <Flo0815> or more JS?
[03:18:10] <EdwardIII> hey, trying to work out a nav problem here: http://jsfiddle.net/3JGMV/
[03:18:22] <tocka> Flo0815 im yeah there is, the form
[03:18:25] <tocka> and thats it for js
[03:18:31] <Jagan_> If i inspect the element an see means , background color for that button element is changed to none.
[03:18:40] <EdwardIII> introducing the 3rd tier of navigation seems to cause odd results. if you scroll down to quickly, you don't ever see the 3rd tier of nav
[03:19:07] <tocka> I use this plugin to validate http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/
[03:19:21] <EdwardIII> that's a very handy plugin
[03:19:31] <BinaryKitten> Jagan_ I just got a notice you tried to Privmsg me
[03:19:31] <tocka> and this one to submit form http://jquery.malsup.com/form/
[03:19:34] <BinaryKitten> please don't do that
[03:19:51] <Robbington> An even better question, why would using delete on a js object not remove the array index, but leave it as undefined?
[03:19:53] <Archer_xda> BinaryKitten - he probably won't do it again since he's done it to loads of people
[03:20:02] <Archer_xda> BinaryKitten - and is getting responses
[03:21:45] <Jagan_> 	BinaryKitten If i inspect the element an see means , background color for that button element is changed to none.
[03:21:51] <BinaryKitten> Jagan_ DO NOT PM me
[03:22:04] <Jagan_> sorry BinaryKitten
[03:22:18] * BinaryKitten is away now.
[03:22:29] <Archer_xda> Now look what you've done
[03:22:33] <Lope> thanks guys!!! you sorted me out AWESOMELY!!!
[03:22:40] <Lope> have an awesome day!!!
[03:22:55] <Trisox> http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=arLXIjVZvh0 lol
[03:22:58] <EdwardIII> hrm this variation works, if i remove the .stop() on the parent ul: http://jsfiddle.net/3JGMV/1/
[03:25:07] <nights> hm
[03:25:08] <Hornet> anyone encoutered a carousel that lets you skip to a given image via an api?
[03:25:28] <EdwardIII> Hornet: hrm, maybe you can do that with cycle?
[03:25:42] <nights> im trying to get mouse position although the mouse is currently not hovering that particular div. $("#wardimage").offset().left
[03:25:48] <nights> is it possible somehow?
[03:26:09] <Trisox> EdwardIII: you can also do this http://jsfiddle.net/3JGMV/2/
[03:26:11] <Robbington> Anyone any good with Js objects?
[03:26:46] <Hornet> EdwardIII: possibly, but that's not what I need really
[03:26:57] <Hornet> just a tool that might accomplish it if I wanted to write my own
[03:27:00] <Hornet> which I don't
[03:28:41] <diverdude> ok...i almost have this working...for some reason when the content of the text field reaches 6 lines, the div box is getting to small to encapsulate the text. Can anybody help me understand why this happens? http://jsfiddle.net/TkWEB/7/
[03:28:56] <Trisox> Hornet
[03:28:57] <Trisox> http://nivo.dev7studios.com/support/jquery-plugin-usage/
[03:29:02] <Trisox> startSlide: 0, // Set starting Slide (0 index)
[03:29:33] <Hornet> I can set the starting slide, yes, but not once the thing is running, no?
[03:29:51] <Trisox> it got pagination in it\
[03:29:55] <Hornet> unless I stop, restart, which will play hell with my events
[03:29:58] <Hornet> hm
[03:31:20] <tocka> Flo0815
[03:31:23] <tocka> you still here?
[03:32:01] <tocka> Just wanted to ask, why is my form being submited only when I press <submit> button 2 times, I mean first time nothing happens, 2nd time it submits
[03:32:03] <tocka> http://roybarber.com/swagscore/
[03:32:14] <tocka> And its not because of slideUp
[03:34:39] <tocka> any ideas?
[03:35:41] <nights> can i get mouse coords regardless of what div im hovering atm somehow?
[03:36:16] <tocka> nights try adding a div on <body>
[03:36:19] <tocka> and then get coords
[03:36:32] <tocka> an ID that is
[03:38:41] <endberg> Can I select somehow the clipped part of an overflow=hidden div?  http://jsfiddle.net/2y647/
[03:38:41] <EdwardIII> Trisox: ah, with hover instead
[03:42:07] <nights> tocka: but it doesnt work if something is covering that
[03:42:19] <nights> then you need to get mouseOver on *that* div instead
[03:42:23] <nights> so that approach is doomed
[03:42:33] <nights> i have plenty of objects intersecting each other
[03:42:40] <nights> and i still need the cursor pos
[03:45:58] <tocka> ;/

[03:48:41] <risky_s> trying to iterate over a objects properties, but trying to omit functions however it shows in the loop -> http://jsfiddle.net/nQzgn/
[03:50:30] <quicksilver> hasOwnProperty doesn't exclude functions
[03:50:37] <quicksilver> it excludes things inherited from the prototype.

[04:04:23] <rethus> i have this array... the array keeps the needed declaration of the body "popover" which is needed in this style:

[04:04:42] <rethus> animation: true,
[04:04:42] <rethus> placement:right
[04:05:04] <rethus> but how can i directly echo the string inside of the popover{ } ?
[04:05:09] <Billy_> how to append to dynamic td's in dynamic tr                 $('<tr/>').attr('id', obj[i].ROOMTYPEID).addClass("even").append($('<td/>').append(obj[i].NAME) + $('<td/>').css({ 'line-height': "25px" }).addClass("simpleTooltip").append(lnkbtn));

[04:39:48] <gym_jane> hi all
[04:40:54] <gym_jane> need help with something. How can I have set a hyperlink only when a user clicks on a div? Say I have an "Click Here" I don't want that to be a link until someone is actually clicked in the div containing that anchor text
[04:42:32] <vl1234> H iHi gud morning
[04:42:39] <vl1234> sorry gud evening
[04:42:48] <Archer_xda> good morning ;)
[04:42:56] <Archer_xda> ah - afternoon!
[04:44:13] <nights> seems like my bootstrap code breaks if itself is loaded by an ajax call
[04:44:14] <vl1234> i know if abject is contains array r not by using jQuery.type(object).....is the same way any method available for finding object inside of object
[04:44:16] <nights> what can i do about it?
[04:44:48] <Archer_xda> gym_jane - var divClicked = false; $("#divid").on("click", function() { divClicked = true; }); $("#anchorid").on("click", function(e) { if (!divClicked) { e.preventDefault(); });
[04:45:06] <vl1234> @Archer_xda.......i know if abject is contains array r not by using jQuery.type(object).....is the same way any method available for finding object inside of object

[04:45:41] <granden> "	$('.AccordionTitle').click(function(){
[04:45:42] <granden> 		console.log($(this).index());"
[04:45:44] <granden> woops
[04:46:19] <granden> was going to paste a pastebin link. But ok, why would that always return 0 no mather which div with the class AccordionTitle I press on?
[04:46:29] <pothibo> When making an ajax call, if the request returns 4xx response, I see an error thrown by jquery… is is possible to quiet this down? I want to handle the error gracefully
[04:46:34] <granden> $(this).index() is always 0 anyway
[04:48:50] <nights> seems like my bootstrap code breaks if itself is loaded by an ajax call, what  can i do about it? something like $(document).on('click', '#timing_next', function() {  but i dont know exactlyu
[04:48:55] <nights> could anyone advice pls
[04:49:19] <gym_jane> Archer_xda that is not what I was after I think.
[04:49:57] <Archer_xda> gym_jane - what's wrong with it?
[04:52:43] <gym_jane> Here it is http://jsfiddle.net/teyKq/3/
[04:52:55] <pothibo> anyones knows how to quiet down jquery when ajax call returns 422?
[04:53:20] <gym_jane> you see "continue reading" is my anchor test and I want to turn that into a hyperlink soon as someone clicks on "teaminfo" div
[04:53:37] <gym_jane> lets say the actual link is "http://www.example.co.uk"
[04:56:23] <gym_jane> Aamir you there?
[04:56:34] <Aamir> gym_jane:  yes
[04:56:55] <gym_jane> could you help?
[04:59:42] <Aamir> pothibo:  not sure but u can use .complete method and than check the error code if its 422
[05:00:09] <pothibo> Aamir: it seems jquery doesn't like using 4xx status code to return validation errors…
[05:00:25] <Aamir> humm
[05:00:45] <Archer_xda> gym_jane : Works fine for me http://jsfiddle.net/teyKq/7/
[05:00:46] <Aamir> use .complete if .error is not catching it :/ check jQuery source code to see whats going on
[05:01:22] <Archer_xda> gym_jane : You didn't actually have the link in your html and you can't declare divClicked with var as it needs to be global and you can't mix code blocks on jsfiddle
[05:02:01] <gym_jane> I don't want to have that link in the actual html unless someone clicks on the div
[05:02:05] <Aamir> gym_jane:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/teyKq/10/ ?
[05:02:59] <gym_jane> Aamir that is what I was after!
[05:03:05] <gym_jane> Thank you
[05:03:14] <gym_jane> Thank you Archer_xda
[05:03:45] <Aamir> gym_jane: np
[05:03:57] <gym_jane> Aamir is there anyway we could rid of the <a></a> tag in the html altogether?
[05:04:07] <gym_jane> unless someone clicks on the div
[05:04:08] <nights> after i load content by ajax, my bootstrap code wont run anymore.
[05:04:14] <nights> anyone know how to like reload the scope?
[05:04:41] <Aamir> gym_jane:  u cannot have just plain text. U can wrap the text with span and than later replace with <a>
[05:04:59] <gym_jane> that would be good
[05:05:04] <Aamir> ok wait
[05:05:23] <Archer_xda> gym_jane : $("div a").hide(); $("div").on("click", function() { $(this).find("a").show(); });
[05:05:55] <Archer_xda> gym_jane : that will hide all links in all divs, and show them when the divs are clicked.  Obviously narrow it down with ids or classes to suit your needs
[05:07:44] <katnegermis> I'm currently adding a lot of divs(siblings) to a parent div; I want to get their position, and set their position back to what it was, but doing this gives me some problems: It seems as if the divs are taking up space, even though they are empty.
[05:08:31] <Aamir> gym_jane:  http://jsfiddle.net/aamir/teyKq/11/  u can leave span inside or u can unwrap
[05:09:09] <gym_jane> You are a star! Thank you
[05:09:18] <Aamir> gym_jane:  i know :D
[05:09:24] <gym_jane> hehe

[05:15:47] <Chirag> Imagine a vertical menu of checkboxes in which except one checkbox, all other checkboxes have vertical submenus of checkboxes(of 'ul' of course). I want to retrieve the values of checkboxes with the help of jSon. How can I do that?
[05:15:54] <Electric_U> Hi has anyone see a plugin that does the google/facebook snippet when you enter a URL?
[05:16:02] <Electric_U> *seen
[05:19:54] <Chirag> Aamir can you help me with the problem stated above?
[05:27:46] <rethus> i create dynamicly - via ajax - my popover_init for id=popover_1 (for example)
[05:27:46] <rethus> if i write in firebug: $('#popover_1').popover(), i got the whole a href-tag of the element
[05:27:46] <rethus> BUT if i $('#popover_1').popover('show'), i got this message:
[05:27:54] <rethus> TypeError: Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined
[05:28:20] <rethus> seems to be initiated, but why does show not work
[05:31:22] <rethus> may this a problem, cause the whole href-tags are some seconds before created with ajax? So i need to register to DOM ?
[05:33:31] <rethus> have i to register new (via ajax created) a-href-Tags to DOM?
[05:36:19] <pachet> rethus: im not even really sure what that means
[05:36:31] <rethus> k. i try to explain.
[05:36:34] <pachet> rethus: maybe you should create a fiddle to illustrate what you mean
[05:37:08] <Trisox> re binding events i think he means
[05:37:17] <Trisox> on links ;) not href
[05:37:34] <Flo0815> hey whats the fastest way to add lines to a table?
[05:37:50] <Trisox> lines = row / tr
[05:37:50] <pachet> lines?
[05:37:52] <pachet> oh
[05:37:55] <Trisox> ?
[05:38:05] <Flo0815> <tr><td></td></tr>
[05:38:14] <Flo0815> rows, sry
[05:38:28] <Trisox> well depends on where in the row and the event etc..
[05:38:44] <Flo0815> it's a blank table and i load data with ajax
[05:38:49] <Archer_xda> $("#tableid").append("<tr><td></td></tr>")
[05:39:10] <Trisox> could be
[05:39:20] <Archer_xda> It's basic, but does what you asked
[05:39:23] <Flo0815> $('<tr>', {}).appendTo ... ?
[05:39:26] <Trisox> or .html()
[05:39:33] <Trisox> with an each loop
[05:40:07] <rethus> i get some filter-declaration out of my database via ajax. the serverside-php which are fired by ajax create a html-table with description and "links" (means a href=... id=popup_1). If i mouseover the link, the "twitter_Bootstrap-popup" should open
[05:40:17] <Flo0815> is one way beter than the other?
[05:40:26] <Flo0815> or does it even matter?
[05:40:28] <Yester> hi guys. i'd like to ask the gurus of you a small question. :) i'm using the tablesorter plugin which works good. but now i have a websocket connection which sends data on an event. so i delete a table row and create a new one and then call: .trigger("update") and .trigger("sorton",[$("#table").get(0).config.sortList]);) my problem is that tablesorter then sort the right way but also adds the old line i removed
[05:40:32] <Trisox> rethus: rebind the event! or use on()
[05:40:47] <Yester> that's because of caching yes but i can not delete it from the cache
[05:40:57] <Yester> i do the update but that doesn't help
[05:41:29] <rethus> Trisox: if ajax return success, the html-table will be add to the page with .html()
[05:41:36] <Trisox> Flo0815: like this
[05:42:15] <rethus> so i see the html-code in firebug. but if i do mouseover, i got an error like described abovbe
[05:42:35] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/UUgy5/
[05:42:42] <rethus> (14:27:46) rethus: if i write in firebug: $('#popover_1').popover(), i got the whole a href-tag of the element
[05:42:42] <rethus> (14:27:46) rethus: BUT if i $('#popover_1').popover('show'), i got this message:
[05:42:42] <rethus> (14:27:55) rethus: TypeError: Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined
[05:43:36] <rethus> Trisox: i jsfiddle some code now, to explain this:
[05:43:44] <Trisox> sure
[05:44:15] <Yester> even if it's slower i would also accept the way to delete the cache completely and then run tablesorter again. i mean it's fast enough anyway. but how to delete the cache
[05:44:39] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/AWcJD/
[05:44:56] <Trisox> Flo0815: was that what you where looking for?
[05:45:01] <rethus> in js-window you see my ajax-call, get as response the above table (html-window)
[05:45:48] <pachet> Yester: you've probably already seen this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10303070/tablesorter-adding-deleted-row-back-in-after-sorting
[05:46:08] <pachet> Yester: that's about as much help i can offer without seeing a code paste
[05:46:31] <pachet> Yester: but i will say that i dont think you should have to worry about the cache
[05:47:15] <rethus> Trisox: Archer_xda: pachet: so in the for-loop you see, that for each box was create an initialisation.
[05:47:41] <Yester> pachet: that's exactly my problem. i tried many things and will check out this now, thanks
[05:48:27] <Trisox> there is no id in your html
[05:48:53] <Trisox> ah popover_1 etc
[05:49:12] <rethus> popover_1.. only for td with "Kriterien"
[05:49:17] <rethus> :) yes
[05:49:49] <Yester> pachet: ok i tried that already but it doesn't work :( hmm it usually should be just trigger("update") but it doesn't work for me
[05:50:09] <cannjeff> jqgrid?
[05:50:09] <Trisox> what if you just did $("a[id=^'popover_']").popover( blaablaa
[05:52:05] <Chirag> Can anyone help me? Its about jSon
[05:52:27] <rethus> Trisox: if i write in firebug: $('#popover_1').popover();, popover works
[05:52:33] <cannjeff> Chirag: ask
[05:52:45] <rethus> so question.. in which way have i to wrote this line:
[05:52:56] <rethus> $("'"+popupBox[i]['id']+"'").popover({
[05:53:06] <Chirag> cannjeff: Imagine a vertical menu of checkboxes in which except one checkbox, all other checkboxes have vertical submenus of checkboxes(of 'ul' of course). I want to retrieve the values of checkboxes with the help of jSon. How can I do that?
[05:53:36] <pachet> rethus: rethus: yeah.. why do you have that
[05:53:36] <rethus> is this right... means double-quotes, single-quote, double-quote + id....
[05:53:48] <pachet> $(popupBox[i].id).popover({
[05:54:19] <Trisox> rethus: try something like this http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/AWcJD/1/
[05:54:46] <Trisox> this http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/AWcJD/2/
[05:54:51] <Trisox> well you get the point
[05:54:59] <cannjeff> Chirag: the checkboxes are client side correct? are you pulling the json from the server and then you want to either check or uncheck the boxes based on whats returned?
[05:55:35] <rethus> Trisox: popover_id is not always unmber starting on 1, can also start at 123 or with a
[05:55:43] <rethus> its a return-value of the ajax
[05:56:16] <Trisox> lol http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/AWcJD/3/
[05:56:19] <rethus> butthis.... $(popupBox[i].id).popover({
[05:56:21] <Chirag> canjeff: actually values of checkbox should be arrived from jSon
[05:56:31] <rethus> does the id not need to be in quotes?
[05:56:37] <pachet> no
[05:56:47] <pachet> ?g bracket vs dot notation javascript @ rethus
[05:56:49] <bot-t> rethus, JavaScript property access: dot notation vs. brackets? - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4968406/javascript-property-access-dot-notation-vs-brackets
[05:57:39] <pachet> Trisox: i havent been checking the earlier pastes, so maybe im looking out of context
[05:57:42] <pachet> but where is 'i' defined
[05:57:44] <cannjeff> Chirag: so you make an ajax call and then json is returned with the values of the checkboxs
[05:58:01] <cannjeff> Chirag: any chance you could throw an example up on jsfiddle
[05:58:28] <Trisox> oh shit
[05:58:51] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/Trisox/AWcJD/4/ there
[05:58:53] <Chirag> should I show you the HTML code. Actually concept of jSon is a bit known to me.
[05:58:57] <Trisox> i = index...
[05:59:06] <Trisox> needed to pass that in the function
[05:59:33] <cannjeff> Chirag: the more info the better
[05:59:49] <cannjeff> jsfiddle has space for the HTML code as well www.jsfiddle.net
[06:00:11] <Trisox> rethus: thats way use a each loop and pass that in the succes and use it to set the id'.. what ever then...
[06:00:18] <Chirag> ok wait. I'll send you link
[06:01:08] <rethus> k, i think i get closer to my error... if i remove the body of the function, it will work
[06:01:46] <Chirag> canjeff: here it is. http://jsfiddle.net/4vAVc/
[06:02:21] <cannjeff> Chirag: nothing there
[06:02:21] <Trisox> rethus: i think your ajax call is unreadable at first
[06:02:59] <cannjeff> Chirag: did you click save?
[06:02:59] <Chirag> Should I quit that jsFiddle page?
[06:03:07] <rethus> Trisox: console.log give me an array with valid data for my ajax-request
[06:03:08] <cannjeff> nope save then send link
[06:03:21] <Chirag> Ok
[06:03:21] <Trisox> rethus: sure it does ;)
[06:06:07] <FND> scott_gonzalez: got a minute?
[06:06:42] <Chirag> Cannjeff: http://jsfiddle.net/aYSa2/
[06:08:18] <scott_gonzalez> FND: What's up?
[06:08:19] <Chirag> Cannjeff: could you see anything?
[06:08:26] <cannjeff> Chirag: worked that time
[06:08:35] <FND> scott_gonzalez: it's about the value vs. label distinction in jQuery UI Autocomplete
[06:08:56] <cannjeff> Chirag: theres no javascript though so where is the json arriving from
[06:08:57] <FND> AFAICT, `select` distinguishes between label and value, so it makes sure the correct value is submitted to the server
[06:09:11] <Chirag> just a moment
[06:09:11] <FND> however, `focus` only operates on value
[06:09:27] <FND> can you confirm this, scott_gonzalez? is it intentional?
[06:09:47] <scott_gonzalez> FND: I cannot confirm. Select sets value.
[06:10:20] <scott_gonzalez> FND: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.autocomplete.js#L274
[06:10:43] <FND> oh, I must have skipped that line
[06:10:45] <scott_gonzalez> FND: Everything is always value when dealing with the input.
[06:11:08] <FND> ok, it seems Friday afternoon is casting its evil spell on me
[06:11:13] <scott_gonzalez> FND: Type something into the location bar in your browser.
[06:11:16] <FND> my apologies for the confusion, scott_gonzalez
[06:11:18] <scott_gonzalez> You'll see exactly the same behavior.
[06:11:26] <scott_gonzalez> FND: No problem :-)
[06:11:54] <FND> I agree that `value` is more trnasparent - there shouldn't be magic with a hidden field by default
[06:12:32] <scott_gonzalez> FND: If you want to do the hidden field trick, you can call event.preventDefault() in focus and select and set the values yourself based on ui.item.
[06:12:52] * FND nods
[06:13:00] <FND> thanks for your time
[06:13:09] <Chirag> cannjeff: http://jsfiddle.net/aYSa2/3/
[06:13:28] <trooney> What's faster a[rel=whatever] or just [rel=whatever] ?
[06:13:35] <FND> trooney: the former
[06:13:37] <scott_gonzalez> FND: We were very careful to make sure the default behavior follows common convention but that we afforded all custom implmenetations, which is why ui.item supports unlimited properties but has specific handling for value and label.
[06:13:47] <trooney> FND: Thanks!
[06:13:59] <scott_gonzalez> trooney: [rel=whatever] is equivalent to *[rel=whatever]
[06:14:37] <trooney> gotchya. wasn't too sure if it [rel=whatever] initially matched all, then filtered through elements. thanks!
[06:16:01] <cannjeff> Chirag: that looks good as for as the format of json, but its not being pulled from a server, assuming you're just using it as an example though
[06:16:01] <Chirag> canjeff: I dont know how to use jSon to store such values. I am after that
[06:16:07] <pachet> this is way late, but
[06:16:14] <pachet> rethus, Trisox: for your consideration : http://jsfiddle.net/kjcTB/
[06:16:27] <pachet> saves a lot of the headache of worrying so much about those ugly html strings
[06:16:53] <pachet> granted, since i cant test your ajax from fiddle i still dont really know what the point is
[06:17:19] <cannjeff> Chirag: why are you using json? I mean when you first arrive at the page containing this HTML, do you want it to pull json from a server containing the state of the checkboxs
[06:19:39] <Chirag> cannjeff: no. In the HTML, they are just static values. I want the same values to be stored with the help of jSon. so after doing that, in the HTML there wont be such values but they will come from jSon. now got it?
[06:21:11] <cannjeff> Chirag: Half of it, json is a language used for communication, not really as a way to store values
[06:22:45] <Chirag> So how can jSon be used in this example? I am new to jSon so m asking. For the state of checkboxes as you said?
[06:23:34] <Archer_xda> Chirag - json is not relevant to what you're doing
[06:23:35] <rethus> so, exactly this parameter break my script: placement:  popupBox[i].placement,
[06:23:46] <Archer_xda> Chirag - it's like asking how to use a motorcycle to get the bus into town
[06:23:52] <cannjeff> Its a communication language
[06:24:05] <rethus> cause this need normaly be like this placement: 'right',, how can i handle this, to do it in right way here?
[06:24:11] <cannjeff> You'd be better off storing the state in an array or some local variable
[06:24:29] <rethus>                     placement:  " ' "+popupBox[i].placement+" ' ",
[06:25:01] <pachet> rethus: will you please stop wrapping your property values in those quotes
[06:25:03] <pachet> it does nothing
[06:25:13] <Chirag> ok thanks archer_xda & cannjeff
[06:25:48] <cannjeff> np
[06:25:50] <pachet> rethus: placement : popupBox[i].placement || 'right'
[06:25:54] <Archer_xda> Chirag - np
[06:26:04] <pachet> rethus: that's assuming that popupBox[i] even exists
[06:26:06] <Chirag> :)
[06:26:11] <pachet> which is a check you should have already done, by that point
[06:26:48] <Archer_xda> Chirag - I'll probably get my wrist slapped for saying this out loud, but json is similar to xml in the way that it's just a convenient way to transport data, usually client to server or vice-versa
[06:28:17] <vl1234> http://jsfiddle.net/yApBj/    see my json struct in this link......and am written a simple jquery code for a.b.x to getting value.........if a and b is dynamically changing means my code is totaly waste............how to write a generic code for that struct...............
[06:28:17] <cannjeff> Archer_xda - i'll agree with that
[06:28:20] <vl1234> Any 1 have a idea about that....please share me
[06:28:28] <Chirag> archer_xda & cannjeff: I am new to jSon & I was asked to implement the same using json. So I was asking
[06:29:26] <Archer_xda> Chirag - I'm certainly no expert and tend to stick with xml at the moment as I'm more used to working with it.  It's good to learn :)
[06:29:31] <cannjeff> Chirag: Ah okay, well if its strictly client side (i.e. no communication with a server) json isn't useful here
[06:30:45] <rethus> pachet: k, i stop quoting it ;) i i don't use "placemment", all works well
[06:31:06] <Chirag> cannjeff & archer_xda : Seems like the one that asked me to do so would not be knowing what jSon is. Thanks anyway for your help
[06:31:13] <rethus> pachet: ah, see my error
[06:31:24] <rethus> i have inside of the var value quotes *argh*
[06:31:46] <cannjeff> Chirag - no problem, good luck
[06:32:14] <Chirag> thanks cannjeff for giving your time to me
[06:32:18] <Archer_xda> Chirag - yeah, if someone's asked you to use json to query dom elements then they don't know what they're on about
[06:32:32] <vl1234> @Archer_xda.....u have any idea about my question
[06:33:14] <Chirag> :p
[06:34:03] <Archer_xda> vl1234 - just one mo I'll look
[06:34:27] <vl1234> http://jsfiddle.net/yApBj/ see my json struct in this link......and am written a simple jquery code for a.b.x to getting value.........if a and b is dynamically changing means my code is totaly waste............how to write a generic code for that struct...............
[06:35:12] <rethus> http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html#popovers here are the declaration of this popover-function...
[06:35:36] <rethus> so normaly i add options to the element like { option: value, option1:value1}
[06:36:00] <rethus> is there a way to add those one by one...
[06:36:15] <Archer_xda> vl1234 if I understand you correctly, check this http://jsfiddle.net/yApBj/1/
[06:36:25] <rethus> would popover().animation('right') work
[06:38:19] <cannjeff> vl1234 - your variable 'm' is an object. So you could even just do:   console.log(m.a.b.x)
[06:38:50] <vl1234> @cannjeff.......thats fine
[06:41:25] <vl1234> if a and b is dynamically changing means that time what i ill do
[06:41:25] <vl1234> @Archer_xda.....am not get u
[06:41:25] <cannjeff> like the value of a and b change
[06:41:25] <cannjeff> or the variable actually changes
[06:41:25] <cannjeff> so instead of m.a.b.x i could be m.c.d.x
[06:41:25] <vl1234> @cannjeff.......exactly
[06:41:26] <cannjeff> Why would that be happening? I'm curious the case thats causing this
[06:41:26] <rethus> ah, got it.
[06:41:26] <vl1234> @cannjeff......u think about diff table values
[06:41:29] <vl1234> and diff diff table
[06:41:47] <vl1234> that b and c  r table anme
[06:41:50] <vl1234> name
[06:42:23] <vl1234> and then inside elements r some text
[06:42:25] <cannjeff> the way you parse json data often times needs to be customized
[06:42:54] <cannjeff> it would be very tough for me to create a generic enough parser without seeing much more of the code
[06:45:12] <vl1234> @cannjeff......now u see this json struct  http://jsfiddle.net/yApBj/2/
[06:52:09] <cannjeff> PERECil append returns karen, appendTo returns element being appended
[06:52:13] <cannjeff> *parent

[06:56:37] <Flo0815> hey guys, short question: i create an object var obj = {key: $('#element').val()}; but i want "key" only set if #element.val() != ''. how cna i do that?
[06:56:55] <Flo0815> without any additional if and variables
[06:57:28] <Haprog> you can't
[06:57:45] <Flo0815> and with additional if?
[06:58:23] <Haprog> var obj = {}; if ($('#element').val() != '') { obj.key = $('#element').val(); }
[06:58:26] <Haprog> something like that?
[06:58:55] <Haprog> no.. akctually obj[key] instead of obj.key
[06:59:02] <Flo0815> k, assumed that
[06:59:07] <Flo0815> very much to type
[06:59:14] <Flo0815> hoped there's a faster possibility
[06:59:17] <Flo0815> ok thx
[06:59:27] <Haprog> I'm not 100% but I don't think so
[06:59:38] <Haprog> +sure

[07:00:33] <starsinmypockets> This only happens on my staging site... Anyone familiar with the plugin have some advice about debugging this?
[07:00:37] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 - the only thing you can do quicker than that 1 line you currently have is to set key to null if the element value == ""
[07:01:04] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 - actually, one mo...
[07:01:10] <Flo0815> Archer_xda: how?
[07:01:22] <Haprog> you can use the ternary operator
[07:01:25] <PERECil> another question: can we attach events to nodes that aren't attached to the DOM?
[07:01:26] <Haprog> ?:
[07:01:26] <bot-t> the elvis operator

[07:02:57] <PERECil> $( '<div>' )
[07:03:08] <Flo0815> cannjeff: won't work if elements are added dynamically
[07:03:16] <cannjeff> disagree
[07:03:21] <cannjeff> i've done it a lot
[07:03:30] <cannjeff> show me an example on jsfiddle
[07:03:35] <sacho> Flo0815, use .on
[07:03:40] <Flo0815> ok, correction: if you have your js in an external file
[07:03:43] <Flo0815> and not in <head>
[07:03:52] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 http://jsfiddle.net/u5MRa/
[07:03:54] <sacho> ...what's the problem again?
[07:04:00] <Flo0815> ^^
[07:04:11] <sacho> "if elements are added dynamically" -> see live in jquery's documentation, and use .on
[07:04:37] <sacho> err
[07:04:38] <Flo0815> like i said
[07:04:43] <sacho> I meant PERECil*, sorry
[07:04:54] <sacho> same-length nicknames :P
[07:05:03] <Flo0815> :)
[07:05:41] <cannjeff> Flo0815 you have to include you JS file somewhere
[07:05:58] <Flo0815> sure
[07:06:12] <cannjeff> by external you mean you would have index.html and main.js
[07:06:28] <Flo0815> but i you have no external js file and write your js in the <head> (which, btw. is horrible) it will work on dynamically added elements
[07:06:37] <Flo0815> jep
[07:06:45] <cannjeff> don't write JS in the head
[07:06:49] <Flo0815> i know
[07:06:56] <cannjeff> and it will work on dynamically added elements
[07:06:59] <cannjeff> i do it all the time
[07:06:59] <Flo0815> omg what we're duscussing about
[07:07:23] <cannjeff> let me throw together a jsfiddle to show you
[07:07:29] <Flo0815> alright
[07:07:31] <Archer_xda> Flo0818 - use $(element).on("click", function() { ... }) instead of $(element).click() and it will work with dynamically added
[07:07:45] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 - use $(element).on("click", function() { ... }) instead of $(element).click() and it will work with dynamically added
[07:07:48] <endberg> hi
[07:08:48] <endberg> Please, help! I'd like to know, is there a way to select the hidden part of a div overflow: hidden? http://jsfiddle.net/2y647/1/
[07:09:11] <Flo0815> YES THATS WHAT IM SAYING ALL THE TIME
[07:09:14] <Flo0815> ...
[07:09:23] <Flo0815> and btw. i don't have a problem with .click
[07:09:27] <Flo0815> its PERECil
[07:09:56] <Luffha> how i can make jquerUI handle comma? meaning it works on first element, but if i put a comma, it does not start on next one.
[07:10:01] <ravenzz> endberg those element are not :hidden actually
[07:10:09] <Archer_xda> I'm saying using .on so that it works on dynamically added elements.  .click does not
[07:10:45] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 - lol - sorry, my misread :p
[07:11:02] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 - did you see the fiddle I gave you about creating the object with & without the key?
[07:12:23] <Flo0815> Archer_xda: yes, thx alot
[07:12:30] <Flo0815> i'm just testing it
[07:12:38] <Rushing> unless .on works like delegate now, i think you're mistaken Archer_xda
[07:12:59] <Rushing> you want to use $(".root-element").delegate("a", "click", function(eve){ … });
[07:13:20] <Rushing> and you can put that anywhere int he doc…top or bottom
[07:13:20] <Flo0815> Archer_xda: when i don't wanna have a value set, when the if-statements = false is this the right way? dConfig.order['description'] = $('#toggle_sort_description').val() == 'ASC' ? false : $('#toggle_sort_description').val();
[07:14:05] <Flo0815> oh yah, this works now (found an error :) )
[07:14:09] <endberg> to ravenzz: and is there any method to select t that clipped part?
[07:14:10] <Flo0815> thx Archer_xda
[07:14:19] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 - did you get it then?
[07:14:27] <ravenzz> endberg try this http://jsfiddle.net/2y647/2/
[07:15:08] <Rushing> Archer_xda: .on() is just a new alias for .bind(), and .click() is just an alias for .on("click", …)
[07:15:40] <Rushing> they are functionally the same. if you want to bind to something to listen to events of dynamically added elements, you should generally use .delegate()
[07:16:19] <Flo0815> Archer_xda: did i get what?
[07:16:24] <Flo0815> ur fiddle? sure
[07:16:31] <cannjeff> Flo0815: http://jsfiddle.net/7zuQp/
[07:17:04] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 - you sorted your problem with the syntax, I mean?
[07:17:12] <Flo0815> ah yeah :)
[07:17:19] <Flo0815> qorks fine
[07:17:23] <Flo0815> *works
[07:17:50] <Flo0815> i'm testing if i can get it to not declarde the key, if the if-statemtens is false
[07:18:52] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 Have you never used that conditional statement before?
[07:18:56] <Flo0815> but i think that'll wont work :)
[07:19:31] <Flo0815> Archer_xda: in this way not :)
[07:20:07] <endberg> to ravenzz: thanks, it's almost what I want, but I'd like to get exactly the clipped part, (I have to columnize a long text to display it in a horizontal way, like in the ebook readers)
[07:20:13] <Flo0815> is there another way? i dont think so... so no, i never used it before
[07:20:33] <leehambley> am I correct that the http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide family of effects don't offer any "on animation complete" callback
[07:20:43] <Shinji__> Hi folks !
[07:21:19] <cannjeff> .click() does work for dynamically added elements...
[07:21:20] <Shinji__> I'm wondering nif there is anyone that can help me with queue ?
[07:21:32] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 - var setA = false (or true); var value = setA ? "A" : "B";  You can use it anywhere were you would normally expect a single value, but it incorporates a type of if statement.  I love it.
[07:22:09] <cannjeff> inline-conditionals :)
[07:22:53] <ravenzz> endberg oh that would be tricky
[07:22:53] <Shinji__> I think it's a bug in fact
[07:23:07] <cannjeff> leehambley, you can add a callback to that
[07:23:11] <Flo0815> Shinji__ what u wanna know? .queue() drives me crazy the last 4 weeks
[07:23:21] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 - just don't use them if you're working with other developers ;)  Lots don't like them as they're not easy to read unless you use them all the time.
[07:23:23] <Shinji__> @Flo0815
[07:23:23] <leehambley> cannjeff: do I have to go through `hide()` ?
[07:23:25] <Brodingo> ?g javascript ternary operator
[07:23:27] <bot-t> Brodingo, Javascript Ternary operator - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1788917/javascript-ternary-operator
[07:23:38] <Shinji__> Hi
[07:23:47] <Flo0815> Archer_xda: yes, everytime i see it, i love it too, because it's so quick
[07:23:57] <Flo0815> but i never learned to use it on my own
[07:24:03] <Shinji__> In fact i'm testing in the callback of animate
[07:24:11] <Shinji__> if there is someting in the fx queue
[07:24:19] <Brodingo> ?mdc ternary
[07:24:23] <bot-t> Brodingo, Conditional Operator - MDN - The conditional operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[07:24:25] <Shinji__> If one element is animted it returns me
[07:24:26] <Shinji__> 1
[07:24:31] <Archer_xda> Flo815 - worth getting used to.  Can cut down a lot of code
[07:24:31] <Shinji__> and if its 2
[07:24:33] <endberg> to ravenzz: I guess :(  I was hoping, that jquery or javascript places some attributum to the clipped part (It would be logical and really useful)
[07:24:39] <Flo0815> Shinji__: very important facet: .Queue works only for one element
[07:24:39] <Shinji__> it returns me 1 and next 0
[07:24:46] <Shinji__> Haaaaaaaaaa
[07:24:57] <Flo0815> so you can't easily queue animations on multiple elements
[07:24:58] <Shinji__> Awwww
[07:25:03] <Shinji__> I See
[07:25:07] <Flo0815> yes that got me too
[07:25:08] <Flo0815> :)
[07:25:23] <Shinji__> I'm trying a method to dtermine when a multiple selector animation is finished
[07:25:40] <Shinji__> because i can't rebin x times (where x its a variable number of element)
[07:25:41] <Flo0815> work with classes
[07:25:58] <leehambley> cannjeff: I have to use http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Effects/Slide I to get the callback I beliebe
[07:26:03] <Flo0815> $('.classofelements').animate(..., time, callbkac);
[07:26:12] <Flo0815> or use promise
[07:26:19] <Flo0815> i used it before
[07:26:24] <cannjeff> leehambley working on it, one second
[07:26:27] <Flo0815> Archer_xda: your know how to  use proise?
[07:26:35] <Shinji__> Ok thanks Flo0815
[07:26:35] <Flo0815> *promise
[07:26:39] <Shinji__> I will try it asap
[07:26:41] <leehambley> sorry, thanks -
[07:26:46] <Shinji__> ^^
[07:27:08] <Flo0815> Shinji__: with promise you can check if every animated element is finished
[07:27:13] <Flo0815> look it up
[07:27:19] <ravenzz> endberg my first idea was, to find the paragraph that is "hidden" split it an wrap each word in a span, you can find the position of each word
[07:27:22] <Flo0815> don't know it for sure
[07:27:33] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 - never heard of it, no
[07:27:55] <cannjeff> leehambley :  check it out http://jsfiddle.net/4nCbN/
[07:28:08] <Archer_xda> ravenzz - was it you asking about finding out what is hidden when using overflow:hidden?
[07:28:20] <Shinji__> Okay i'm on the documentation, I will give it a try , THX !
[07:28:40] <ravenzz> endberg you would probably use some smart algorithm that work on chunks
[07:29:07] <Flo0815> good luck :)
[07:29:13] <ravenzz> Archer_xda no, endberg was I give him a solution actually
[07:29:14] <Archer_xda> ravenzz - it's okay - I get what's going on now
[07:29:23] <leehambley> cheers cannjeff; that requires cooperation from JQuery UI to override $.hide, right ?
[07:29:25] <Archer_xda> endberg : http://jsfiddle.net/GS3Vt/47/
[07:29:34] <leehambley> and the normal jq animations don't call-back to anywhere
[07:30:26] <cannjeff> leehambley yes, the link you sent (for UI/Effects/Slide) pulls from code in jQuery UI
[07:30:58] <leehambley> ok, cool - in this case I need UI, because I want slide-left, but when using the normal animations, then it's not possible to wait until they complete ?
[07:31:08] <leehambley> (thanks, though, this is working really good for me now)
[07:31:59] <cannjeff> i believe $.animate() has a callback on complete
[07:32:08] <endberg> to ravenzz: wow, that's what Im looking for! Thanks!
[07:32:16] <Shinji__> Yeah @endberg it's true
[07:32:22] <leehambley> ahh, cheers, that might be smarter than just using $.fadeOut or something
[07:32:29] <Shinji__> this is one of the last params
[07:32:52] <Archer_xda> endberg : lol - you're welcome ;)
[07:32:57] <cannjeff> $.fadeOut() also has a callback
[07:33:50] <cannjeff> jQuery had very very good documentation: api.jquery.com
[07:33:58] <cannjeff> http://api.jquery.com/
[07:34:05] <cannjeff> *has
[07:35:39] <granden> http://in2media.dk/ - That site is really cool, with the 3D flip. Is there any jquery plugin that could do that?
[07:38:16] <Flo0815> guys, i wish you a happy weekend
[07:38:19] <Flo0815> see you on monday
[07:38:21] <Archer_xda> granden - how about "view source"?
[07:38:33] <Archer_xda> Flo0815 - you have a good weekend too mate
[07:40:39] <granden> Archer_xda: Tried, but not good enough to understand what does that neat 3D flip
[07:42:18] <Archer_xda> granden - If you can't understand how it's put together in someone else's page then it's gonna be just as difficult to use in your own page.
[07:42:27] <Archer_xda> granden - I'll have a look
[07:43:52] <Shinji__> Flo0815 It's working well...houps you are gone...But Big Thanks :)
[07:44:19] <Shinji__> See ya guys !

[07:45:46] <pothibo> is it possible to tell jquery to not throw an exception if an ajax request returns 422 ?
[07:45:46] <cannjeff> looks like a custom plugin for $.animate() pretty cool!
[07:46:04] <cannjeff> error: function() {}
[07:46:09] <cannjeff> in the ajax options
[07:47:03] <pothibo> cannjeff: nah, it still throws an error
[07:48:59] <cannjeff> pothibo you sure?
[07:49:10] <pothibo> cannjeff: well this is my current setup
[07:49:35] <pothibo> https://gist.github.com/2896003
[07:50:30] <endberg> to ravenzz: I played some with the script, and I have a little problem with that: If I made a bigger div (more height), the text is shown only in one row, and overflows to the right ( http://jsfiddle.net/GS3Vt/97/ ) and not fills the div, like for example here: http://jsfiddle.net/2y647/5/
[07:52:12] <ravenzz> endberg I am in hurry sorry, I have to go
[07:52:25] <endberg> to ravenzz: its ok, thanks
[07:52:28] <cannjeff> pothibo wheres the error being thrown?
[07:52:29] <ravenzz> endberg but you can start from this http://jsfiddle.net/zH676/
[07:52:30] <cannjeff> to console?
[07:52:36] <pothibo> cannjeff: yes
[07:52:47] <cannjeff> well you're logging it
[07:52:51] <ravenzz> as I said it would be better to use some binary algorithm so you don't split anything
[07:52:51] <cannjeff> with console.log
[07:53:07] <pothibo> http://cloud.pothibo.com/3Y3H223X0e0l0h1T242E
[07:53:09] <ravenzz> but half times or less
[07:53:41] <ravenzz> (try to remove the overflow hidden with firebug o the dev tools)
[07:56:58] <JuJuBee> I have content that gets loaded dynamically using ajax...  How do I attach a handler to that content since the page has already loaded?
[07:59:35] <Brodingo> ?on @ JuJuBee
[07:59:36] <bot-t> JuJuBee, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:00:45] <JuJuBee> what about pre 1.7 ?
[08:01:15] <Valid> live() I think?
[08:01:43] <JuJuBee> Yes, I just found that also... thanks

[08:02:04] <JuJuBee> That works...
[08:03:13] <bartmax> jquery ui error ?? Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'split' of undefined
[08:03:21] <bartmax> jquery-ui-1.8.21.min.js
[08:03:47] <Archer_xda> bartmax - sounds like you're using split somewhere where your selector is not returning an element
[08:04:03] <bartmax> using $('.tabs').tabs()
[08:04:08] <bartmax> ill take a look
[08:04:10] <bartmax> ty Archer_xda
[08:04:28] <Archer_xda> bartmax np
[08:05:24] <bartmax> Archer_xda: what's wrong with :  $('.tabs').tabs(); ?
[08:05:27] <bartmax> .tabs DOES exist
[08:05:38] <Archer_xda> Can you supply a URL or fiddle?
[08:06:05] <Archer_xda> open the console and type $(".tabs") to see what it returns
[08:06:13] <bartmax> Archer_xda: ill try that
[08:07:42] <bartmax> it returns an array of 1 div element... this is weird
[08:09:02] <Archer_xda> Not what you expect then?
[08:09:21] <bartmax> yes it's what i expect
[08:09:43] <bartmax> don't get why it throws that split.. maybe an html markup error
[08:10:43] <Archer_xda> what does .tabs() do?
[08:10:50] <bartmax> no errors on html.. im tabs is from jquery ui
[08:11:20] <bartmax> ill check html structure
[08:11:26] <bartmax> ul li divs etc
[08:12:06] <jyg> I'm seeing multiple fires (usually 2, sometimes 3) of a .click().  I've tried about 20 something ideas from google.  I'm just stumped.  Unfortunately, this is on an old site, using 1.2.6.  Any help or ideas  would be much appreciated.
[08:16:56] <bartmax> is not working
[08:17:15] <j_ayen_green> I'm doing a .delegate to attach an onclick event. In the onclick event function I have an alert, for testing. The alert is firing when the page loads. Why?
[08:18:15] <Archer_xda> bartmax - is there possibly a url I could look at?
[08:18:19] <Brodingo> j_ayen_green you should use .on()
[08:18:31] <j_ayen_green> Brodingo: using jquery 1.4
[08:18:39] <bartmax> Archer_xda: let me try doing a fiddle, problem is im using a custom css theme selector. but ill try
[08:19:07] <Archer_xda> k
[08:19:26] <Brodingo> j_ayen_green ah, well you should use console for debugging, paste your code if you need some assistance
[08:19:49] <manski> can anyone confirm that scrolling the jQuery UI autocomplete result list with the mouse wheel in google chrome closes the list? ( http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#maxheight )
[08:20:07] <manski> or does this just happen on my computer?
[08:20:37] <Brodingo> manski mine stats open
[08:20:43] <Brodingo> stays*
[08:20:44] <Ukto> can someone give me some quick help with basic math? http://jsfiddle.net/6HHwa/1/ thanks!
[08:21:46] <j_ayen_green> Brodingo: http://pastebin.com/YMQJqwPa
[08:23:03] <manski> brodingo: darn. could you also check http://unicode.mayastudios.com and enter "arrow" in the search field?
[08:23:07] <Brodingo> j_ayen_green youre calling the function with clicked('nav_1')
[08:23:28] <rethus> someone use this with pageination ? http://datatables.net/extras/
[08:23:49] <j_ayen_green> Brodingo: yes... but that's supposed to happen on a click event, not on a page load
[08:23:50] <rethus> is there a way to get "All" in the dropdown-box for "visible rows" ?
[08:25:21] <Brodingo> j_ayen_green its happening when the code is exectued because youre calling it with ()
[08:25:49] <Brodingo> manski works fine, not closing
[08:26:09] <Brodingo> chrome 19 os x, magic mouse
[08:26:09] <j_ayen_green> Brodingo: so if I need to pass it an argument, that would be in the data parameter of .delegate rather than in the function call parameter?
[08:27:02] <bartmax> Archer_xda: http://jsfiddle.net/fpzTs/
[08:27:03] <Brodingo> hmm probably
[08:27:05] <Brodingo> ?tias
[08:27:05] <bot-t> Try It And See
[08:28:12] <manski> brodingo: thanks. I guess that the mouse driver of my system transfers the focus from the search field to the result list when i scroll it.
[08:33:58] <Archer_xda> bartmax - I don't get any errors
[08:34:07] <bartmax> Archer_xda: not on fiddle still not working
[08:35:20] <j_ayen_green> Brodingo: every example I look at for .delegate creates an anonymous function within the .delegate call as the handler function... .delegate(a,b,c,function()).  Can I not refer to an existing function rather than create on there?
[08:35:30] <Archer_xda> bartmax sorry mate - can't do anything with that fiddle then.  I'd need the problem in front of me to look into it
[08:35:57] <Brodingo> j_ayen_green yes but like i said, if youre using parens with your function name its going to be called
[08:36:09] <bartmax> Archer_xda: i know ... thank you .. cant see what's the problem actually
[08:37:02] <Archer_xda> bartmax is it definitely the .tabs() call that causes the error?
[08:37:26] <j_ayen_green> Brodingo: I ask because after you said that I changed the call to .delegate({selector},'click',{data_to_pass},{myFunctionName}) and the handler no longer fires on page load but not when clicked either
[08:37:47] <j_ayen_green> without parens
[08:37:52] <bartmax> Archer_xda: yes. but i now seeing that google maps is being called even it's commented so im investigating :d
[08:38:14] <Archer_xda> bartmax - good luck
[08:38:51] <j_ayen_green> Brodingo: $.delegate('#primary-links a','click','nav_1',clicked);
[08:39:16] <Ukto> quick help with basic math anyone? :) http://jsfiddle.net/6HHwa/1/ thanks!
[08:39:26] <bartmax> Archer_xda: thank you archer

[08:54:10] <phoenixsampras> hello
[08:54:32] <Archer_xda> phoenixsampras hi
[08:54:34] <phoenixsampras> how to insert via console, a registry in the webdatase of a browser?
[08:54:53] <phoenixsampras> ive created the table, but cant do it via console… just via JS. im using Chrome
[08:55:53] <Archer_xda> should be the same in the browser console as in the script
[08:56:12] <Archer_xda> are you using localStorage?
[08:57:17] <Archer_xda> localStorage.setItem("name", "value"); console.log(localStorage.getItem("name"));
[08:57:35] <bartmax> Archer_xda: fixed it
[08:57:58] <bartmax> Archer_xda: had a plugin created by me in the map namespace collisioning
[08:58:29] <bartmax> with google
[08:58:49] <bartmax> ? .map
[08:58:49] <bot-t> .map(callback): Pass each element in the current matched set through a function, producing a new jQuery object containing the return values. http://api.jquery.com/map/
[08:58:52] <Archer_xda> bartmax - ah that old chestnut.  I learned from a wise man to wrap as much as possible in (function($) { ... })(jQuery)
[08:58:53] <bartmax> lol, with jquery itself
[08:59:14] <bartmax> Archer_xda: i did wrapped in but using $.fn.map <-- im an idiot i know :D
[08:59:19] <Archer_xda> Bloody Google :p
[08:59:22] <nisseni> when uploading a file with .ajax - which dataType should I be using?
[08:59:28] <bartmax> wasn't google... jquery have a map function
[08:59:34] <Archer_xda> ah well - at least you found it, bartmax - good find
[08:59:41] <Archer_xda> yeah, I know.  I never use it, but I know of it
[08:59:56] <Archer_xda> it's similar to each().function() isn't it?
[09:00:03] <bartmax> Archer_xda: yea... it was weird because it worked flawlesslly until i used .tabs()
[09:00:28] <j_ayen_green> ah, never mind, it's flagging the .delegate saying the object has no such method :(
[09:00:37] <bartmax> Archer_xda: it's like each but it create an array with the return values.
[09:01:10] <Archer_xda> bartmax that just sounds like each to me :p  I'll use it and learn it one day, when I need to ;)
[09:02:20] <anavel> hai. i have this simple code. http://pastebin.com/UzELNn10  . if i run #1, the input checkbox will be enable properly. But if i run #2, it still disabled. Seems like the alert() makes thing set properly. Any idea ?
[09:03:30] <nisseni> when uploading a file with .ajax - which dataType should I be using?
[09:05:10] <bartmax> it's there a way to do a delegate to when an object it's visible ?
[09:05:11] <quizme> does it make sense to do this: http://pastie.org/4051275
[09:05:15] <quizme> or is it overkill ?
[09:05:30] <bartmax> quizme: jquery already do that
[09:05:36] <jiggz> yes
[09:06:05] <quizme> jiggz yes to which question ?
[09:06:11] <jiggz> quizme
[09:06:24] <bartmax> quizme: still it's ok to do it
[09:06:31] <bartmax> i dont see a problem with that
[09:06:50] <jiggz> quizme: you'd probably be using your plugin in a ready plugin, i would be the redundancy up to the user who is using, and how they would like to use plugin
[09:07:04] <jiggz> *ready function
[09:07:24] <jiggz> wow i can't type lol
[09:07:45] <quizme> ok
[09:07:54] <quizme> so if somebody saw my code
[09:08:17] <quizme> and if they were a sociopath stalker, they wouldn't kill me ?
[09:08:52] <jiggz> quizme: I would most likely use your plugin in my ready(), so i dont see it necessary for the plugin to require the check
[09:09:10] <jiggz> quizme: probably lol
[09:09:43] <nisseni> I'm submitting a file from a form, and I want to do this without refreshing - http://pastie.org/private/wowm0oqgxk4kvhorcr8wg - this is how I do it, however, the dataType is wrong. I don't want to upload via ajax, just get the data from the upload...
[09:09:49] <quizme> jiggz i'm not writing a plugin
[09:10:05] <quizme> jiggz: i just wanna use jquery.
[09:10:22] <jiggz> quizme: i don't understand
[09:10:59] <quizme> jiggz: i don't understand why you're talking about plugins.
[09:12:15] <jiggz> nisseni: you can find some good solutions here (see answer #2): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/166221/how-can-i-upload-files-asynchronously-with-jquery
[09:12:57] <jiggz> It quizme: the pastie looked like a plugin, because of the format
[09:14:46] <EnlightenMental> have a quesiton about arrays[].. I've defined a global array, and am trying to do an array.push(value) from a function within a function.  nothing seems to be added though
[09:16:10] <Archer_xda> quizme - that's perfectly fine.  I use that all the time.  Just make sure to keep anything global (and not reliant on $) outside the main (function()) block
[09:16:45] <quizme> archer_xda thanks for the validation.
[09:16:46] <Archer_xda> if it's only ever used inside the (function()) block then leave it in there.  It's good to encapsulate - gets round issues with noConflict calls in 3rd party code
[09:16:53] <cannjeff> EnlightenMental maybe show us an example on jsfiddle.net
[09:17:34] <Archer_xda> EnlightenMetal - as per ^^^ - it should work so give us a non-working fiddle example
[09:19:49] <EnlightenMental> cannjeff: http://collabedit.com/xqq3c  Im not familiar with jsfiddle yet
[09:23:39] <yohann> i have a really weird autocomplete problem in  jquery
[09:23:45] <yohann> can anyone help??
[09:24:56] <nisseni> jiggz: getting the same error: Resource interpreted as Image but transferred with MIME type text/html:
[09:25:29] <yohann> nisseni are you sending an ajax request?
[09:25:37] <yohann> nisseni: are you sending an ajax request?
[09:25:56] <nisseni> yohann: I suppose so, isn't that what jquery.form is doing?
[09:26:19] <yohann> just do a contentType:"image/jpeg"
[09:34:44] <kelye> hello
[09:35:28] <anavel> is there a way to execute something after other dom manipulation is finished >
[09:35:30] <anavel> ?
[09:35:50] <kelye> anavel: $(function () { execute; })
[09:36:16] <kelye> i'm using jqueryUI to create a modal window
[09:36:25] <kelye> but on close it does not destroy the window
[09:36:39] <kelye> the modal remains as hidden in the DOM
[09:37:14] <anavel> kelye, thanks. but it doesn't solve my problem. :(
[09:37:37] <kelye> then you are not describing the problem correct :)
[09:37:44] <anavel> here's my problem.
[09:37:47] <anavel> hai. i have this simple code. http://pastebin.com/UzELNn10  . if i run #1, the input checkbox will be enable properly. But if i run #2, it still disabled. Seems like the alert() makes thing set properly. Any idea ?
[09:39:17] <Archer_xda> anavel try $('input#chk_sticky').removeAttr('disabled');
[09:39:23] <anavel> ok
[09:39:40] <kelye> damn
[09:39:46] <kelye> 5 seconds faster
[09:39:48] <kelye> :D
[09:39:56] <Archer_xda> hehe
[09:40:02] <anavel> Archer_xda, still doesn't work.
[09:40:29] <kelye> any idea about why jqueryUI is not removing the whole modal div ?
[09:41:14] <anavel> kelye, $('div#id).remove() ?
[09:41:39] <kelye> not that easy. i'm not controlling the div
[09:41:45] <kelye> it's created by the modal plugin
[09:42:32] <anavel> Archer_xda, if i added alert(), it works ! >_>
[09:42:40] <Archer_xda> anavel - try using $(window).load() instead of $(document).ready() (or however you do the document ready)
[09:42:41] <anavel> strange problem.
[09:43:39] <brl0> was browsing the ui source, ended up in ui.mouse.js, and i'm curious about line 59, 		// we may have missed mouseup (out of window)
[09:43:42] <brl0> 		(this._mouseStarted && this._mouseUp(event));
[09:44:20] <brl0> lol, paste fail.. any reason for the this._mouseStarted && ?
[09:45:04] <nb-ben> Hey, using jQuery Mobile, I am trying to make a persistent header with no success, what is wrong with this: http://pastebin.com/QmRt4zUW
[09:45:20] <brl0> this line: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.mouse.js#L59
[09:46:04] <brl0> oh, if the first is false, it won't even attempt the second.. still drinking coffee
[09:46:29] <brl0> that's nice shorthand
[09:46:57] <anavel> Archer_xda, eventually, i need to add alert() so jquery can properly enable the checkbox... :|
[09:48:00] <Archer_xda> anavel - no - that's not the answer.  It's just to do with the order things are being executed
[09:48:14] <Archer_xda> The alert doesn't stop the window completing, but it stops the script running
[09:49:16] <Archer_xda> brl0 - I've never thought of using that before.  Completely gets rid of the need for an if statement, doesn't it
[09:49:28] <brl0> yea, except it's harder to read :D
[09:49:47] <brl0> this is the same number of characters: if (this._mouseStarted) this._mouseUp(event);
[09:50:11] <Archer_xda> True
[09:50:23] <brl0> :D less cool though
[09:50:26] <brl0> heh
[09:50:27] <Archer_xda> Heh yeah
[09:50:55] <Archer_xda> Could be handy with multiple vars.... (boolA && boolB && boolC && doStuff());
[09:51:20] <Archer_xda> Still only the same as an if though isn't it.  It's actually a bit pretentious :p
[09:51:27] <nb-ben> with jquery mobile how can I achieve a persistent header? like the persistent footer
[09:51:42] <anavel> Archer_xda, i notice that sometimes jquery execute script depending with which dom are ready first. Am i right ?
[09:52:52] <anavel> But still. then why that alert() makes thing work properly while with its absent, things not working properly. in this case, the checkbox.
[09:53:24] <Archer_xda> The alert doesn't stop the window completing, but it stops the script running
[09:53:43] <Archer_xda> Did you try using $(window).load()?  That will solve your problem or you've found a bug in the browser
[09:54:25] <anavel> wait
[09:55:09] <anavel> Archer_xda, tried on FF 6 & 12, and on opera 12 beta. same results.
[09:55:38] <Archer_xda> with window.load?
[09:55:48] <anavel> wait
[09:58:03] <anavel> won't run. btw. that checkbox is on a dialog box. which need to be enabled/disabled dynamically.
[09:59:03] <NoiseEee> anavel: sounds like you're trying to come to grips with the async nature of javascript.
[09:59:28] <anavel> NoiseEee, yeah. notice that.
[09:59:47] <Archer_xda> anavel - without seeing the whole script we won't be able to help you then
[10:00:03] <anavel> wait
[10:01:06] <Archer_xda> I'm out of here mate - home time :D
[10:02:28] <anavel> :(
[10:02:35] <anavel> NoiseEee, can you help me ?
[10:02:49] <anavel> here's the snippet.  http://pastebin.com/fqmML73t
[10:03:33] <NoiseEee> anavel: there's nothing in that snippet to suggest adding an alert is going to change anything
[10:04:28] <anavel> NoiseEee, but, it works properly if i added alert(). :/
[10:04:55] <NoiseEee> anavel: undoubtedly because of some code that isn't presented in that snippet
[10:05:11] <anavel> hmmm
[10:06:54] <anavel> NoiseEee, here's the whole function. sorry for the indentation. http://pastebin.com/9mW0wSwg
[10:08:13] <NoiseEee> anavel: code keeps happily going along after your xhr/ajax call... it doesn't wait
[10:08:51] <NoiseEee> anavel: so presumably you need to put all the following code into its own function, and call that when the ajax/xhr finishes
[10:09:44] <NoiseEee> anavel: so line 29 is likely firing before lines 7-10
[10:10:52] <anavel> i c.
[10:11:46] <anavel> so perhaps that alert() thing making the delay and makes lines 7-10 finished before the dialog show ?
[10:12:04] <NoiseEee> indeed
[10:12:15] <NoiseEee> google/read about how to use callbacks with xhr/ajax
[10:12:29] <anavel> alright. thanks NoiseEee. :D
[10:12:44] <ckoning> Does anyone know how to set the contents of a <style></style> element using vanilla javascript?
[10:13:09] <ckoning> innerHTML() is crapping out in IE8
[10:17:06] <Jon47> ckoning I think there are plugins that encapsulate editing style rules if you're interested in that, paul_irish once recommended this one to me: http://flesler.blogspot.com/2007/11/jqueryrule.html , and I've since been using this one and i like it a lot: https://github.com/Box9/jss
[10:17:27] <poppiez> why doesn't this give me the start of the month instead of the second? http://jsfiddle.net/MKdEs/
[10:17:41] <poppiez> gives me Apr 2 - shouldn't it be Apr 1?
[10:17:41] <ckoning> Jon47 Thanks very much I will take a look at those
[10:18:24] <Jon47> i think the reason it's good to use a framework for this is because it's not really a documented feature and  browsers handle it differently..
[10:25:53] <gnarf> ckoning: innerText may or may not help you there
[10:27:03] <coldhead> poppiez: day must be 0 indexed, just to make life hard
[10:27:05] <coldhead> dates are hard
[10:27:11] <gnarf> ckoning: http://jonraasch.com/blog/javascript-style-node ?
[10:27:16] <coldhead> you should use moment.js or something to make it slightly less awful
[10:27:25] <poppiez> coldhead: no, that's the previous hour of the month
[10:27:31] <anavel> NoiseEee, thanks !!! my script works properly now. <3
[10:27:35] <poppiez> "0 will result in the last hour of the previous month"
[10:27:57] <jwg2s> can anyone tell me what crazy stuff is going on with this in firefox or how i might address it?  http://www-dev.market76.com
[10:27:58] <jwg2s> its really crazy only sometimes onload
[10:28:15] <coldhead> i stand by my claim that date/time is hard
[10:28:35] <coldhead> and get a lib up ya
[10:28:43] <poppiez> hehe ;)
[10:30:20] <ckoning> gnarf Thanks very much
[10:30:29] <ckoning> that is exactly what I'm trying to do
[10:30:40] <sh0ne> Guys, I have two forms on a single page and I must validate input fields of both forms. How can I check which submit button was pressed? I mean, which form's input fields do I need to validate?
[10:36:43] <shoky> poppiez: first of all don't listen to anything w3schools.com says
[10:36:55] <mnemoc> :D
[10:37:07] <shoky> poppiez: and 2nd, in this case it seems MDN docs are also wrong ;P
[10:54:38] <gnarf> ckoning: np - finding the right words to feed google to find that wasn't easy ;)
[10:55:07] <ckoning> Well, it turns out that it is an insoluble problem
[10:55:28] <ckoning> the head and style elements are write only in IE 8-
[10:55:46] <ckoning> I got a version of Raasch's code to work
[10:56:14] <ckoning> but it failed silently, meaning it didn't do what it was supposed to but it allowed script execution to continue
[10:57:18] <ckoning> I can however fallback to adding a <link> to the head
[10:57:24] <ckoning> and call out to my server
[11:00:38] <arungpt> hi guys, i have a (hopefully) quick question. in this js file https://gist.github.com/2897273 on line 143 i am parsing a JSON response. is there any way to handle a JS response instead?
[11:02:14] <ckoning> eval is the only way
[11:02:14] <caniuse> ckoning: 'SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier'
[11:03:09] <arungpt> ckoning: were you responding to me?
[11:03:27] <ckoning> arungpt yes, sorry. Something like this: response = $.parseJSON(response);
[11:03:29] <ckoning> shot
[11:03:42] <ckoning> arungpt response = eval(response);
[11:03:52] <arungpt> gotcha i will try that! thank you!
[11:05:00] <ckoning> coniuse I've tried a few different methods, and they each crap out in different ways
[11:05:03] <arungpt> ckoning: bleh its not doing anything
[11:05:15] <arungpt> ckoning: im trying to return a js response to an ajax call
[11:05:51] <arungpt> it works with regualr forms but with this new drag and drop it isnt responding with the js file
[11:05:51] <ckoning> arungpt Do you have a sample response?
[11:06:34] <arungpt> my server logs say that it is returning my create.js.erb file
[11:06:44] <arungpt> you mean a sample of what i am looking to respond with?
[11:07:21] <arungpt> i updated this page with the file https://gist.github.com/2897273
[11:07:54] <arungpt> ckoning: my logs say it is returning that file but nothing happens so im assuming the dragndrop.js file is not handling the response in some necessary way
[11:09:09] <arungpt> ckoning: when i try to post the response to the console i get this: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token c jquery.min.js:2
[11:10:04] <ckoning> arungpt you can put the response into an alert and copy it from there
[11:10:39] <ckoning> arungpt add a line on 142: alert(response)
[11:11:14] <arungpt> ckoning: hmm no alert gets fired, i just get this again Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token c jquery.min.js:2
[11:12:34] <ckoning> arungpt: Is the page live somewhere?
[11:13:00] <arungpt> no sorry, im development
[11:15:39] <arungpt> ckoning: is there anything else i can send to help
[11:16:11] <ckoning> It sounds like there is a problem further up the call tree. I would suggest using console.log entries to trace through the execution of the feature
[11:18:51] <ckoning> arungpt You can also try replacing the jquery version with an unminified one to see exactly where in jquery the execution is breaking
[11:27:51] <j_ayen_green> My handler still isn't firing. Shouldn't this work in jquery 4.2? http://pastebin.com/3gFAxzx7
[11:29:19] <sacho> why are you using 1.4.2?
[11:29:39] <j_ayen_green> sacho: because that's what the site uses...i have no control over that
[11:29:42] <sacho> try a jsfiddle.net test case where you can show it's not firing
[11:30:23] <j_ayen_green> sacho: well, the alert in the function call doesn't fire either
[11:31:24] <lectrick> If I have a call $('form input[name='+csrf_param+']').val(csrf_token); , does that apply it to ALL form elements on the page?
[11:32:05] <NoiseEee> lectrick: certainly all form elements that match the input selector
[11:32:25] <lectrick> NoiseEee: i.e. which have that input with that name.
[11:32:34] <NoiseEee> yes
[11:32:41] <lectrick> cool.
[11:32:53] <NoiseEee> iirc you might need to put double quotes around the name value
[11:33:18] <NoiseEee> $('form input[name="'+csrf_param+'"]')
[11:33:20] <mold> anyone has used jquery.videobackground?
[11:35:17] <tukruic> .
[11:39:09] <neurochrome> hey folks, can anyone tell me WTH is going down with this code... http://jsfiddle.net/Dxcpz/  On my local version the width bounces out and in at seemingly random intervals, but on the fiddle it doesn't even retract?! What gives?
[11:39:30] <sacho> you only need the double quotes if csrf_param has spaces in it
[11:39:34] <neurochrome> I want it to stretch in width, and then when the user leaves the button, retract.  simple as that!
[11:39:44] <bartmax_> i have a jqueryui css custom selector (.ui-theme) but if I do a dialog, the 'parent' .ui-theme cannot use it unless it's on the body element.
[11:40:18] <bartmax_> and since the css gets like: .ui-theme .ui-dialog  it must have a parent .ui-theme class
[11:42:03] <rwparris2> on a mobile device, how can I get the current element I'm touching?  I'm using touchmove event, but I don't see anywhere that it stores the element it is currently over.  (More specifically I want to know which cells in a table I've dragged over)
[11:43:30] <rwparris2> with jquery mobile I can use vmousemove and the event has a .toElement and .fromElement which works perfectly on PC, but on ios & android those properties are null
[11:47:53] <diverdude> I am trying to make an e vertically expanding div with contentEditable=true. I have made this so far: http://jsfiddle.net/TkWEB/7/ but the problem is that the height of the box does not correspond to the height of the text. When something like 7 lines of text has been written it begins to overflow the div. I cannot figure out what is causing this and how i can correct it. Can anybody help me with this?
[11:48:39] <neurochrome> OK, I've amended that fiddle, now it's a simple width change of an element, if you hover the mouse around the middle after mouseover, the element goes crazy... how do I stop this from happening? http://jsfiddle.net/Dxcpz/10/
[11:50:07] <neurochrome> diverdude, does height: auto, overflow:auto not help?
[11:52:12] <diverdude> neurochrome: hmm its helping, but still there are problems, look here : http://jsfiddle.net/TkWEB/10/
[11:54:15] <diverdude> neurochrome: did you look ?
[11:54:31] <neurochrome> diverdude, yeah, just finished... not too sure to be honest mate
[11:55:21] <diverdude> neurochrome: its really weird...what did you think?
[11:56:01] <solepixel> is there something quirky about checking to see if an <option> is "disabled" ?
[11:56:06] <solepixel> i'm having the hardest time with this
[11:56:13] <solepixel> see here: http://castlesandcrowns.com/shop/chloe-capri-pink/
[11:56:17] <neurochrome> I think it's gonna be something really simple ;)
[11:56:30] <NoiseEee> solepixel: thats not code!
[11:56:32] <solepixel> the item 6-6x is disabled
[11:56:38] <solepixel> no it's not :(
[11:56:43] <solepixel> unless you like kids clothes
[11:56:48] <solepixel> but look in the console
[11:56:56] <solepixel> you'll see "false" across the board
[11:57:00] <diverdude> neurochrome: me?
[11:57:07] <neurochrome> diverdude, yeah
[11:57:29] <NoiseEee> solepixel: great
[11:57:34] <solepixel> if the option is disabled, it should display the text http://pastebin.com/MSziW9pT
[11:57:42] <solepixel> (there is some code)
[11:57:57] <cari_veri_dt> hey there. is there a plugin to distribute text to several <divs> ? They will be used by a booklet to make pages. thanks.
[11:58:09] <NoiseEee> solepixel: personally i'd just "if option.disabled==true", screw turning the option into $(option)
[11:58:19] <NoiseEee> ===true
[11:58:21] <solepixel> i shall try
[11:59:20] <solepixel> console.log(option.disabled); gives me false across the board on all options
[11:59:51] <solepixel> just occured to me to check the version of jquery this site uses
[12:00:28] <solepixel> it uses 1.7.1
[12:00:29] <solepixel> hmmm
[12:00:33] <solepixel> this is so strange
[12:01:16] <solepixel> when i do console.log(option); there are no disabled attributes
[12:02:03] <solepixel> wtf
[12:02:34] <NoiseEee> solepixel: "jQuery('#pa_size option').each(function(i,el) { if (el.disabled===true) { alert('item '+i+', disabled'); }});"  in console on that site returns correct results
[12:02:46] <NoiseEee> solepixel: so check things over
[12:03:12] <solepixel> item 6, disabled
[12:03:32] <solepixel> well what did i do wrong
[12:07:41] <mold> NoiseEee: is not $('#pa_size option:disabled').each(function(i, el) {alert...} better?
[12:07:53] <solepixel> well
[12:08:05] <solepixel> see, i think the page has to fully load before that works
[12:08:12] <keyword> hi guys I have a question I need to bind a collpasible method http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-events.html with my backbone view http://pastie.org/private/oz8xrrqguinrb3be9psipw anyone can help me?
[12:08:19] <solepixel> both versions don't work within the js file
[12:08:23] <solepixel> they work in the console
[12:08:25] <NoiseEee> mold: sure, i was just iterating through the options themselves because thats what he was doing
[12:08:45] <solepixel> only reason i did it that way cause :disabled wasn't working for me
[12:08:47] <NoiseEee> solepixel: then you should double-check to see if your iterating through what you think you are
[12:09:08] <solepixel> i'm adding a Timeout to see if that makes a difference
[12:09:41] <solepixel> yes
[12:09:54] <solepixel> a 500ms timeout all of a sudden it's finding them now
[12:10:01] <solepixel> totally weird
[12:10:27] <mold> :)
[12:10:39] <NoiseEee> solepixel: sounds like you have a race condition / aren't really programming for async properly
[12:10:47] <NoiseEee> slash could use a callback
[12:11:16] <solepixel> well, this plugin is mega old
[12:11:23] <solepixel> http://www.bulgaria-web-developers.com/projects/javascript/selectbox/
[12:11:36] <solepixel> client was using it on their old site, just copied it over
[12:11:43] <solepixel> didn't want to modify it though
[12:11:49] <solepixel> and there are no callbacks
[12:11:54] <solepixel> not on load that is
[12:11:58] <solepixel> just on click events and such
[12:12:20] <ngharo> when do you call the fix_disabled function?
[12:12:34] <solepixel> right afterwards
[12:12:44] <ngharo> and that script is in the <head> ?
[12:12:50] <solepixel> http://pastebin.com/bGwiK5Bd
[12:12:51] <solepixel> yeah
[12:12:57] <ngharo> well thats why
[12:13:02] <solepixel> same file
[12:13:04] <solepixel> both on document ready
[12:13:11] <ngharo> oh
[12:13:53] <solepixel> here: http://castlesandcrowns.com/wp-content/themes/castlesandcrowns/js/theme.js
[12:17:11] <solepixel> yay! working now
[12:18:05] <mib_mib> how do you create an arbitrary callback for standard jquery stuff, i.e. the .prop method?
[12:18:07] <diverdude> I am trying to make an e vertically expanding div with contentEditable=true. I have made this so far: http://jsfiddle.net/TkWEB/7/ but the problem is that the height of the box does not correspond to the height of the text. When something like 7 lines of text has been written it begins to overflow the div. I cannot figure out what is causing this and how i can correct it. Can anybody help me with this?
[12:19:02] <ngharo> mib_mib: .prop is synchronous so there is no reason for a callback.  The code following it will run when it completes.
[12:21:39] <sabotage> danheberden: any chance the presentation you gave yesterday @Instrument is online?  I missed the first 10-15min and the info about grunt
[12:22:16] <mib_mib> ngharo: o okay
[12:22:27] <Ukto> can someone give me some quick help with basic math? http://jsfiddle.net/6HHwa/1/ thanks!
[12:23:18] <ngharo> mib_mib: any asych methods already have callback support
[12:23:45] <keyword> hi guys I have a question I need to bind a collpasible method http://jquerymobile.com/test/docs/content/content-collapsible-events.html with my backbone view http://pastie.org/private/oz8xrrqguinrb3be9psipw anyone can help me?
[12:25:16] <mib_mib> agharo: so any synchronous methods run in the order they are put before anything else?
[12:32:53] <ngharo> essentially
[12:40:50] <innociv_> Why would $("#storage").attr('src') return [iframe#storage] on "<iframe id="storage" width="0" height="0" style="display: none;" src="http://www.example.com/messenger/messengeriframe.html" name="storage">"?
[12:41:02] <innociv_> instead of a string that matches src=""?
[12:44:54] <obryan> In the jquery getJson call, where I would have a callback, for example, I have tried $.getJson(url, mycallback(data)); but it insists that 'data' is not defined.
[12:45:23] <obryan> however if i use  $.getJson(url, function(data){mycallback()}) this works
[12:45:24] <obryan> why?
[12:46:11] <systemfault> obryan, in your first example... you assign the return value of the mycallback(data) call as the second parameter of the function..
[12:46:40] <obryan> systemfault: actually in my full line i have 3 parameters, the url, the parameters to the URL and my callback
[12:46:44] <obryan> sorry I was being lazy :)
[12:47:08] <cannjeff> innociv_ it returns the url as a string for me
[12:47:33] <innociv_> It does for me at the start, then it randomly starts returning the object :\
[12:47:56] <cannjeff> can you recreate on www.jsfiddle.net for me to check out?
[12:48:07] <innociv_> Nope. Too much code.
[12:48:09] <obryan> now if I use the $.getJson(url, mycallback()) version, and remove the 'data' input, it works fine
[12:48:12] <innociv_> Something must be conflicting with a plugin
[12:48:49] <systemfault> obryan, a callback is a function..
[12:48:57] <cannjeff> well $.attr('src') should always return whatever the elements attar 'src' equals
[12:49:20] <systemfault> $.getJSON('url', function(data) { use data here }) ;
[12:49:35] <innociv_> Even if I do it from console, it's returning [iframe#storage]
[12:49:51] <innociv_> If I refresh the page, it's fine for a while.
[12:49:57] <innociv_> Something might be screwing up jquery
[12:50:08] <cannjeff> theres something happening in your code then thats causing that
[12:50:12] <obryan> systemfault: yes, but why does it require the "function(data)" instead of a defined function?
[12:50:24] <cannjeff> without being able to see the code i really can't find the bug for ya :(
[12:50:37] <obryan> systemfault: it's forcing me to use an anonymous function
[12:50:46] <systemfault> obryan, because the second parameter is a function :'( $.getJSON('ur', myCallback); would work
[12:50:57] <mcnellis> I want to use $(selector).text() but I don't want to get the text contents of children nodes, just the text from the node in the selector
[12:51:03] <mcnellis> How can i do that?
[12:51:23] <innociv_> Yeah.  Like I said, too much code.  It won't replicate on jsfiddle if I just put in the element and $(selector).attr('src').   I thought it might sound like something someones seen before caused by some conflict, or something.
[12:51:25] <obryan> systemfault: yes I know it's a function but why must it be an anonymouse function?
[12:51:38] <innociv_> It's fine i'll just dig more
[12:51:46] <systemfault> obryan, it doesn't need to be a anonymous function... just a function
[12:51:49] <cannjeff> innociv_ understandable sorry
[12:52:14] <obryan> systemfault: but when I make it a pre-defined function, the data from the getJson is not passed through
[12:52:16] <obryan> that is my point
[12:52:21] <cannjeff> mcnellis have an example?
[12:52:29] <obryan> if i make it anonymous, the data is passed through, if it is defined, it doesn't
[12:52:33] <systemfault> obryan, you're doing that? $.getJSON('ur', myCallback);
[12:52:41] <systemfault> (ur being the good url..)
[12:52:42] <obryan> yes
[12:52:44] <obryan> yes
[12:52:52] <systemfault> Then you have a problem with your code.
[12:52:59] <obryan> wow thanks for the revelation
[12:53:22] <systemfault> obryan, how the hell can we help you if you don't give us code to work with... genius?
[12:53:31] <coldhead> great work everyone, take 5
[12:53:52] <Hopsy> coldhead!
[12:54:05] <obryan> the function is stupidly simple it just does a console.log(data)
[12:54:16] <obryan> it STILL insists that 'data is undefined'
[12:54:25] <obryan> i'm not sure how much more simple I can explain it
[12:54:37] <coldhead> 'allo Hopsy !
[12:54:39] <systemfault> obryan, function myCallback(data){ console.log(data); } $.getJSON('theurl', myCallback); works
[12:54:54] <obryan> not on my end
[12:55:02] <Hopsy> hii
[12:55:48] <systemfault> obryan, then give us a url so we can help you..
[12:55:49] <jasoncarroll> system's code is different than yours. variable scoping?
[12:56:04] <systemfault> Because the code is stupidly simple.
[12:56:10] <systemfault> So you're doing something wron.
[12:56:16] <systemfault> *wrong even..
[12:56:29] <coldhead> self referential wron
[12:58:04] <sqwishy> Do you mind if people refer to your jquery download link in their sites? As opposed to serving it themselves or getting it from google?
[12:58:32] <cannjeff> squishy how would that be beneficial?
[12:59:07] <coldhead> sqwishy: its better to use one of the CDNs
[12:59:11] <coldhead> they're less likely to go down
[12:59:20] <coldhead> and more likely to be pre-cached in the user's browser
[12:59:22] <cannjeff> tell that to apache :p
[13:05:30] <obryan> systemfault: pastebin.com/pf25wX4v
[13:06:18] <systemfault> obryan, stop making a function call :(
[13:06:37] <systemfault> obryan, the third parameter is tri_again and not tri_again(data)
[13:07:03] <systemfault> You want to pass a function as the third parameter..
[13:07:49] <obryan> see I knew something was missing
[13:08:02] <systemfault> What you're currently doing is calling tri_again with a undefined "data" variable then assign the return value of tri_again as the third value
[13:08:02] <g0bl1n> can't Firefox read mouse event offsetX and offsetY ?
[13:08:09] <g0bl1n> Chrome read well
[13:10:26] <Ricaz> A css question: Anyone know how to make a transparent inside-border on a box? Like here: http://rcz.dk/files/insideborder.png (except this is done on the image, not in css)
[13:21:28] <thurmda> So… how else do I achieve this: $('body').delegate('a[href]', 'ready', linkShortener);
[13:22:16] <ravenzz> wut
[13:22:35] <thurmda> various things can add links to my page. I want to pass any new links through a linkShortener method when they arrive
[13:22:54] <ravenzz> $(document).ready(function(){ haveFun() })
[13:23:02] <thurmda> but new DOM elements don't fire a 'ready' event
[13:23:25] <thurmda> @ravenzz    and then after that links are added
[13:23:27] <ravenzz> ?newContent @ thurmda
[13:23:27] <bot-t> thurmda, jQuery.newContent is a plugin that helps maintain a set of callbacks for elements as they are added. Bind a callback with $( selector ).newContent( function ) and execute the bound callbacks by calling .newContent() on any new content you are adding to the DOM - https://gist.github.com/1003630
[13:23:47] <neurochrome> when animating width on an element (A) with a border, that has another element (B) above it in the z-index, the border of element A rises above element B.... is this expected behaviour? A known bug?
[13:24:37] <thurmda> I need to do this without modifying code that adds the links
[13:25:13] <ravenzz> can't you try and see if that is the thing you were looking for?
[13:25:31] <thurmda> $('body').delegate('a[href]', 'click', thisWorks);
[13:25:47] <thurmda> but I can't really change the link as someone is clicking it
[13:25:50] <ravenzz> ok links don't have a ready event
[13:25:51] <ravenzz> dude
[13:25:55] <thurmda> not very cool thing to do
[13:26:27] <thurmda> img have a ready event when they load
[13:26:38] <thurmda> everything used to have a ready event
[13:26:56] <thurmda> that's how and why document.ready fires
[13:27:14] <thurmda> because all the decendants fired their readies
[13:27:45] <ravenzz> I don't know, man it is friday. I guess that you can fix all the links when the document is ready and then take care of the new one
[13:27:53] <ravenzz> with the gnarf's plugin
[13:38:08] <coldhead> to gnaw on your bones so white
[13:41:08] <minijupe> how do I update the innerHTML and have it flash yellow for a second?
[13:41:53] <thurmda> haha yea, thanks for even responding ravenzz, have a good weekend
[13:42:27] <thurmda> These links will be here on Monday
[13:44:16] <g0bl1n> weird, Firebug tells me offsetX and offsetY are undefined for the mouse event...
[13:44:19] <g0bl1n> 1.7.2
[13:46:23] <yedimind> if you have $('#el1, #el2').is(':checked'); will that return true only if both are checked
[13:46:25] <yedimind> or either or
[13:48:49] <ravenzz> try and see? :p
[13:49:00] <ct3> I am having difficulty with the addressing of my image where <img src="/CraigThomas/${item.source}" alt="Image not found" id="widgetimage"> and CraigThomas is the top directory how do i use jquery so I donthave to put CraigThomas
[13:49:43] * yedimind stabs ravenzz with a shovel
[13:50:34] <ravenzz> mhuahu
[13:50:54] <ravenzz> seriously, is easier to try than ask
[13:51:07] <ravenzz> anyway yes
[13:51:25] <ravenzz> I mean no, it will be true
[13:51:34] <ravenzz> if one of them is checked
[13:52:54] <shoky> yedimind: Description: Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return true if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments.
[13:53:23] <yedimind> yeah, i ended up with $('#el1, #el2').filter(':checked').length === 2
[13:53:25] <yedimind> thanks to ben
[13:54:25] <ravenzz> or $('#el1:checked, #el2:checked')
[13:54:55] <coldhead> that doesn't help you work out if ANY are unchecked
[13:54:58] <Zzaichik> this.checked
[13:55:00] <ryanneufeld> coldhead!!
[13:55:05] <coldhead> ry ry!
[13:55:25] <ryanneufeld> sup buddy?
[13:55:30] <neurochrome> lol, just read coldheads eariler comment!!... wrong chan?
[13:55:55] <yedimind> ravenzz, that will return true if either one
[13:55:56] <neurochrome> "to gnaw on your bones so white"
[13:56:00] <yedimind> is checked, not both
[13:56:04] <yedimind> anyway, its all good
[13:56:07] <coldhead> nothing good, ryanneufeld
[13:56:11] <coldhead> working like a schmoe
[13:56:15] <coldhead> what's up with you?
[13:56:26] <ryanneufeld> anyone know of a nice plugin for jquery that will take an object/array and print out a nice tree structured set of ul/li?
[13:56:43] <ryanneufeld> working on rebuilding our site, version 5 in code igniter
[13:56:45] <coldhead> ryanneufeld: json2xml
[13:56:53] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: thanks
[13:57:07] <coldhead> i'm not sure it exists, ryanneufeld, but i hope you can create it
[13:57:25] <ravenzz> yedimind you should check againt the length anyway
[13:57:35] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: it does, but it's not quite what I'm after
[13:57:59] <coldhead> json2xml + xlst?
[13:58:14] <ryanneufeld> nah
[13:58:20] <ryanneufeld> I'm close to a solution
[13:58:30] <ryanneufeld> but I think I failed at recursion
[13:59:29] <ryanneufeld> seems my uls aren't getting closed the way I wanted them to
[14:00:48] <Ricaz> A css question: Anyone know how to make a transparent inside-border on a box? Like here: http://rcz.dk/files/insideborder.png (except this is done on the image, not in css)
[14:01:17] <sacho> yes
[14:01:41] <sacho> image x2 one over the other, crop one, transparent on the other
[14:01:57] <sacho> interestingly enough there is a crop attribute in javascript
[14:02:00] <sacho> err
[14:02:39] <sacho> ...in the dom
[14:03:45] <sacho> The way to do it with a background-image is more complicated
[14:30:08] <mib_mib> can you pass the this object as a function parameter fine?
[14:31:10] <mib_mib> i.e. $('#mydiv').click(function(e) { some_func(this); }); function some_func(the_element) { alert($(this).text()} ?
[14:31:25] <mib_mib> or does it just pass the element as text and it relooks it up?
[14:31:41] <mib_mib> basically, if you pass the 'this' object, is this passing a reference to the direct object or something?
[14:31:41] <sacho> you can pass this just as you can pass any other variable
[14:31:58] <mib_mib> will it refer to the exact same thing?
[14:32:11] <systemfault> mib_mib, the "this" inside the function(e) {} will be another one.
[14:32:39] <systemfault> mib_mib, so you need to "capture" the outer "this"
[14:32:44] <sacho> in your case, some_func would be called with the_element a reference to the "this" of the event handler
[14:33:06] <mib_mib> systemfault: TYPO sorry! I meant alert($(the_element));
[14:33:10] <sacho> I don't know what you meant by "the direct object"
[14:33:29] <Ricaz> I'm using the UI effect "slide" on .show() and .hide() of an element. The object slides in on .mouseover() of parent div, but how do I make it cancel the animation and slide it back out if the mouse leaves the object before the .show() animation finishes? Right now it just queues them.
[14:33:44] <mib_mib> sacho - i guess im confused about the 'this' object - or a jquery variable at all - how does it reference a specific element on the page?
[14:33:56] <sacho> mib_mib, this isn't that special, you can think of it as an implicitly passed parameter
[14:34:07] <mib_mib> sacho: okay i understand that now
[14:34:34] <sacho> jquery variables hold references to objects
[14:35:31] <mib_mib> sacho: actually i think i get it now.... so when you do like g = $('#mydiv') it looks up #mydiv on the page, then creates a pointer to it
[14:35:43] <mib_mib> what happens if the html changes in the mean time?
[14:35:50] <mib_mib> and then i re-reference the variable?
[14:36:04] <sacho> the function $() actually creates jquery objects
[14:36:12] <sacho> the jquery object itself has a reference to the dom object
[14:36:15] <mib_mib> right right - so in fact it looks it up everytime
[14:36:21] <sacho> no
[14:36:25] <mib_mib> oh
[14:36:32] <sacho> I think if you change the dom it will invalidate the reference
[14:36:33] <mib_mib> ah the dom object interesting
[14:36:36] <sacho> that is
[14:36:50] <sacho> $('#mydiv').get(0) would be null or undefined
[14:37:03] <sacho> if you change the dom so the dom object no longer exists, that is
[14:37:27] <mib_mib> okay i'm starting to understand... the dom is a container object
[14:37:28] * sacho checks
[14:37:30] <mib_mib> that just has lookup methods
[14:37:40] <mib_mib> for lots of objects of type div etc
[14:37:45] <sacho> uhh
[14:38:21] <sacho> the dom is a set of objects which allow you to interact with the structure of your page - it's an object representation of the html/css/javascript
[14:38:56] <sacho> jquery selectors traverse the dom, finding objects that match your criteria, then they wrap those objects in special jquery objects(used for jquery functionality)
[14:38:57] <mib_mib> sacho: rite rite - so if i do var g = $('#mydiv')
[14:39:30] <sacho> jquery finds a dom htmlelement object which has the id "mydiv", then it wraps it in a jquery object, and returns the jquery object
[14:39:45] <sacho> you can access the dom element with .get()
[14:39:49] <mib_mib> sacho: right
[14:39:53] <mib_mib> sacho: within this jquery object
[14:40:07] <sacho> yes
[14:40:09] <mib_mib> sacho: is it storing like the start and end ?
[14:40:17] <sacho> start and end?
[14:40:23] <sacho> dom objects are not html strings
[14:40:36] <mib_mib> sacho: okay thats what i was wondering
[14:40:44] <mib_mib> sacho: so its storing a reference to the dom object
[14:40:57] <sacho> no, the html/css/whatnot is parsed, and a tree of objects is created called the "dom"
[14:41:07] <mib_mib> sacho: rite rite
[14:41:18] <sacho> yes, it stores a reference to the dom object
[14:41:23] <mib_mib> sacho: okay this is making more sense
[14:42:00] <mib_mib> sacho: so essentially if i think about the data structure of the dom as a tree of objects....that makes sense...then it just references individual objects ah ok
[14:42:02] <mib_mib> thanks!
[14:42:12] <sacho> removing the dom object from the dom tree doesn't seem to really impact the reference
[14:42:14] <mib_mib> sacho: i guess i was just thinking of it as static text....my bad
[14:42:50] <mib_mib> sacho: hmmmm what does that actually mean? that it must create a copy of the dom object?
[14:43:02] <mib_mib> sacho: instead of just a reference
[14:43:05] <sacho> no
[14:43:18] <sacho> I was just answering the first question - what if the html changes
[14:43:44] <sacho> actually there's only a few ways you can influence the html, instead of the dom
[14:43:48] <sacho> innerhtml, document.write, etc...
[14:44:00] <mib_mib> so if the html changes though, theoretically if it was just a reference, wouldnt it then point to nil after removed if it didnt make a copy?
[14:44:12] <sacho> no
[14:44:29] <sacho> removing a dom element from the dom tree doesn't necessarily delete it as an object
[14:44:40] <sacho> you can have dom objects detached from the main tree - ie documentfragments
[14:44:47] <sacho> for example
[14:44:58] <sacho> $('<div/>') creates a new html element
[14:45:10] <sacho> it's not yet attached to the dom
[14:45:32] <sacho> you can test it yourself.
[14:45:44] <mib_mib> sacho: quick clarification - when we say DOM, we are talking about an internal tree representation that is created automatically from the html on the page right
[14:45:49] <sacho> try, var test = $('#mydiv'); $('#mydiv').remove(); test.get(0);
[14:45:53] <mib_mib> is this DOM done by the browser itself?
[14:46:00] <systemfault> mib_mib, The term is unfortunately overloaded..
[14:46:01] <sacho> console.log that last thing or something
[14:46:25] <systemfault> mib_mib, The DOM is the browser's API
[14:46:30] <mib_mib> ah yes
[14:46:56] <systemfault> mib_mib, But we also use it to designate the DOM tree that is rendered from the HTML
[14:47:02] <sacho> you could then to test.appendTo($('body')) and you'd put #mydiv back into body
[14:47:13] <mib_mib> systemfault: gotcha
[14:47:13] <sacho> yes, I used the term poorly several times. :)
[14:47:49] <venus_> hello, how can i insert a onchange value to an input code ?
[14:48:13] <mib_mib> sacho: so back to the original question... a when you add html, the browser adds the html to the current internal tree structure of objects it has
[14:48:37] <sacho> it converts the html to objects representing it, then adds the objects
[14:48:44] <mib_mib> right right...
[14:48:50] <mib_mib> yeah makes sense.
[14:48:58] <mib_mib> thanks!
[14:48:59] <sacho> ie a <div></div> becomes an htmldivelement
[14:49:00] <mib_mib> clarity
[14:49:43] <sacho> or something close to that sort. :|
[14:52:33] <venus_> no?
[14:53:13] <mib_mib> things making a lot more sense now thanks guyz
[14:53:33] <aberrant> hi all
[14:53:51] <aberrant> I know this is really lame, but I could really use someone to step me through creating what should be a simple jquery function.
[14:54:01] <sacho> venus_, I didn't really understand your question
[14:54:16] <aberrant> I have a bunch of table rows that are form inputs that I'd like to hide until an "add another" link is clicked.
[14:54:36] <aberrant> then have the next one in the table exposed.
[14:54:56] <aberrant> but I have no idea even where to start.
[14:55:14] <aberrant> the table itself has an id, and each row has a class.
[14:55:21] <brunLOL> Why don't you create a table row when "add another" is clicked?
[14:55:39] <aberrant> brunLOL: it's a django template so I don't know whether that's possible.
[14:56:05] <aberrant> I'm rendering the template using django, so I think by the time it gets to the user it's already there.

[14:57:04] <bot-t> coldhead: SyntaxError: JSON.parse
[14:57:10] <mib_mib> how can i search for a link matching a particular href?
[14:57:11] <venus_> like onchange=(something);
[14:57:11] <sacho> "inside the input code"?
[14:57:19] <sacho> you want to add an onchange attribute? why?
[14:57:33] <aberrant> brunLOL: so would you have the time to guide me on this?
[14:57:36] <sacho> why not use jquery's events, or failing that, addeventlistener/attachevent?
[14:57:43] <venus_> <input type="TEXT" onchange="CalculateTotal(this.form)">
[14:57:47] <venus_> like this
[14:57:51] <coldhead> ?eval try {JSON.parse('<h1>This will fail</h1>');} catch (e) {alert('probably html');}
[14:57:51] <bot-t> coldhead: "probably html"
[14:57:53] <venus_> i want to calculate totals
[14:57:55] <sacho> I got it, but why do you want to do that
[14:57:59] <venus_> of an order form
[14:58:00] <coldhead> ryanneufeld: ^^
[14:58:10] <sacho> there are better ways to bind  event handlers with jquery
[14:58:10] <brunLOL> aberrant: I was thinking you could put a CSS class with display: none then remove it when clicking the new button.
[14:58:18] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: Ah.. that'll work
[14:58:28] <coldhead> it's ideal!
[14:58:30] <venus_> sorry?
[14:58:33] <aberrant> brunLOL: yeah, I got the display: none, but I don't know how to remove it for a specific row one at a time.
[14:59:38] <ryanneufeld> coldhead: it's a deal!

[15:02:15] <aberrant> HAHAHAHA
[15:02:18] <eph3meral> is there a way to select all items (css style) where the class is *not* something? like: select all elements with class="node" but not class="leaf"
[15:02:35] <systemfault> eph3meral, the :not(selector) selector

[15:08:45] <eph3meral> hmm, ok so I'm getting an error when trying to use .find() to find a child of an svg:g element
[15:08:46] <relipse> what is the best way to clear all the select box options?
[15:08:54] <relipse> can i just do .options.length = 0;
[15:09:01] <eph3meral> i just want to retrieve the <title> element from this svg:g element
[15:09:11] <eph3meral> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<SVGGElement> has no method 'find'
[15:09:35] <systemfault> eph3meral, wrap it with jQuery $(mySvgElement).find(.....
[15:09:39] <eph3meral> ok
[15:09:43] <ryanneufeld> relipse: you mean to remove them?
[15:10:05] <ryanneufeld> relipse: or do you mean to remove the selections?
[15:10:31] <eph3meral> systemfault, ok yeah that works, thanks
[15:10:37] <systemfault> Wonderful
[15:11:16] <eph3meral> now I'm getting console.log($(this).find("title").html()); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'replace' of undefined
[15:11:48] <neurochrome> could anyone tell me why this animated button sometimes stretches twice, it's a bit unpredictable http://jsfiddle.net/ayVZs/5/
[15:11:59] <systemfault> eph3meral, that single line looks syntaxically correct...  :/
[15:12:12] <eph3meral> hmm, ok interesting, well I do get an array back
[15:12:22] <aberrant> YAY
[15:12:23] <aberrant> it works
[15:12:37] <coldhead> great work everyone, take 5
[15:12:45] <aberrant> in case anyone's wondering: 	$("#addAnother").click(function(){$("#inputmatrix tr.hide").first().removeClass('hide');
[15:12:45] <brunLOL> aberrant: good to hear
[15:13:45] <eph3meral> yeah, hmm, so how do I get the first element returned?
[15:13:56] <eph3meral> i'm getting an array when I use .find()
[15:14:05] <eph3meral> and when I use .find()[0] i get that same error about replace
[15:14:17] <eph3meral> and then if I wrap it all in $() i get the other error, back and forth, to infinity
[15:14:33] <systemfault> eph3meral, What do you want to do with the title?
[15:14:58] <teear> hevonen
[15:15:26] <coldhead> ?get @ eph3meral
[15:15:27] <bot-t> eph3meral, .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[15:15:34] <teear> put that in the title
[15:15:37] <systemfault> eph3meral, [0] will unwrap the node... you could use .first() to get the first element
[15:15:50] <neurochrome> when using hover and animate to change an elements width, if you hover coming in from the side the element width animation fires twice, there must be a way round this?!
[15:15:59] <teear> it's a random string for world evolution
[15:16:41] <eph3meral> ok thanks lemme try this
[15:17:44] <eph3meral> systemfault, yeah actually, using .first() doesn't help either
[15:17:46] <eph3meral> lemme try .get
[15:18:00] <systemfault> .get unwraps.. it's not what you want..
[15:18:37] <eph3meral> k, well .first() appears to unwrap as well
[15:18:46] <eph3meral> i'm not 100% actually what unwrap actually means
[15:19:04] <eph3meral> to me, all I can see is that it wraps an array around the element vs just returning that one element
[15:19:58] * neurochrome looks out into the vast emptiness of space
[15:21:02] <systemfault> eph3meral, jQuery wraps the DOM nodes to enhance them with functions..
[15:21:04] <coldhead> it only seems empty, neurochrome. its actually swarming with space gypsies
[15:22:05] <neurochrome> ahhhh, entrophy's immortal enemy... the space gypsy
[15:22:13] <neurochrome> I've heard of them

[15:34:51] <sacho> how have you fixed it to the bottom
[15:34:54] <sacho> how are you resizing it
[15:35:10] <ryanneufeld> using jquery ui
[15:35:11] <sacho> code
[15:35:15] <ryanneufeld> and it's bottom:0 in my css
[15:35:44] <sacho> jquery ui modifies offsets
[15:35:49] <sacho> it's probably unsetting bottom: 0
[15:35:52] <ryanneufeld> it is
[15:35:56] <ryanneufeld> it's setting the top pz
[15:35:58] <ryanneufeld> *px
[15:36:00] <ryanneufeld> :s
[15:36:01] <coldhead> thanks, UI
[15:36:12] <ryanneufeld> I'm just checking the docs for it now
[15:36:28] <ryanneufeld> otherwise I'm gonna poke ajpiano with a stick and see if he knows
[15:36:47] <Hopsy> noooooooo spliittt
[15:36:50] <sacho> you want to change the way you're affixing the div to the bottom
[15:37:05] <ryanneufeld> no, I want jquery ui to stop fucking with the way I do
[15:37:08] <eph3meral> coldhead, ok cool, so that worked well, now I've got issues when I try to do this: circleElement = $(this).find("circle").first(); circleElement[0].attr("fill", color)
[15:37:29] <sacho> how do you propose it resizes the element, then
[15:37:44] <sacho> if you're just going to change height, why use jquery ui at all?
[15:37:49] <eph3meral> Uncaught TypeError: Object #<SVGCircleElement> has no method 'attr'
[15:37:53] <sacho> it's a two-liner
[15:38:06] <ryanneufeld> sacho: for dragabble resize?
[15:38:12] <ryanneufeld> you can do that in two lines?
[15:38:15] <ryanneufeld> DO It
[15:38:16] <sacho> you never mentioned "draggable"
[15:38:42] <sacho> the resize is trivial
[15:39:12] <ryanneufeld> sacho: so is pointing out the obvious. I suppose I wasn't clear
[15:39:26] <sacho> ..
[15:39:38] <ryanneufeld> i need a mouse interaction resizable div that will stay fixed to the bottom of a page
[15:39:42] <ryanneufeld> much like a console
[15:39:50] <sacho> yes, that's trivial
[15:39:56] <ryanneufeld> DO
[15:39:57] <ryanneufeld> IT
[15:40:00] <ryanneufeld> :P
[15:40:04] <sacho> why the caps?
[15:40:21] <ryanneufeld> cruise control was on
[15:40:39] <ryanneufeld> Please, if it's trivial, could you provide me an example
[15:40:39] <ryanneufeld> ?
[15:41:15] <coldhead> eph3meral: that's because [0] is returning you the actual DOM node at that point, without any jQuery magic
[15:41:33] <coldhead> if you want that elem WITH jQuery use .eq(0) instead of [0]
[15:42:02] <coldhead> or you can probably do it native with .fill = '#whatever'
[15:42:04] <coldhead> IDK
[15:42:14] <sacho> sure, mousedown adds a mousemove event, mousemove modifies the height based on clientY, mouseup removes it
[15:42:27] <sacho> optionally adding a cursor style involves a few more lines
[15:42:41] <shoky> ryanneufeld smth like this? http://jsfiddle.net/nhBxq/2/
[15:43:09] <eph3meral> ok cool i'll try, thanks
[15:43:29] <sacho> seems like resizable doesn't mess with your bottom rule.
[15:43:46] <ryanneufeld> sacho: sure doesn't
[15:43:53] <ryanneufeld> unless your content scrolls
[15:43:55] <ryanneufeld> then you're effed

[15:46:18] <shoky> ryanneufeld that happens regardless of the resizable

[15:47:31] <eph3meral> coldhead, ahh yes, .eq() appears to work, thank you
[15:48:40] <shoky> what's all the sighing for, a fiddle replicating the problem was the first (only?) thing you needed to say
[15:49:06] <coldhead> eph3meral: you'll save yourself some time if you get your head around the difference between eq(0), [0] and get[0]
[15:49:08] <sacho> he's sighing because we aren't mindreaders
[15:49:25] <ryanneufeld> sacho, I said it was fixed
[15:49:42] <ryanneufeld> you provided a "trivial" demo, with an absolute position

[15:54:48] <steveoliver> (can't use forms api?)
[15:55:16] <aaronELBorg> yeah, jquery please. steveoliver
[15:55:32] <aaronELBorg> steveoliver, well any sort of javascript
[15:56:35] <aaronELBorg> steveoliver, i think i almost have it
[15:56:46] <steveoliver> i don't see much working
[15:56:53] <johnline> https://dl.dropbox.com/u/58483366/webdev/projects/tnwh/index.html
[15:56:54] <steveoliver> what/where should i be seeing?
[15:56:59] <johnline> my neew startup
[15:58:03] <aaronELBorg> steveoliver, actually you're right.
[15:58:26] <aaronELBorg> basically the numbers after the anchor tag in the url should be the new selected value in the dropdown
[15:59:02] <aaronELBorg> steveoliver, you'll notice that the number in the url (post click) correspond to the option values in the drop down.
[15:59:02] <Posterdati> hi
[15:59:14] <Posterdati> is it possible to use svg as buttons in jquery?
[16:01:35] <aaronELBorg> steveoliver, if you don't wanna lend a hand, it's cool.  i'm gonna repost though.  lemme know
[16:01:58] <steveoliver> tryin' to check it out, but i gotta move on to some other stuff, sorry
[16:02:10] <aaronELBorg> steveoliver, it's cool.
[16:02:27] <aaronELBorg> anyone else wanna take a look?  http://jsfiddle.net/CXF4K/5/
[16:02:41] <aaronELBorg> trying to change a dropdown to reflect anchor tags in the url
[16:05:35] <sacho> ryanneufeld, http://jsfiddle.net/JrkyX/ seems to mostly work
[16:06:24] <Ricaz> Anyone know if it's possible to make a script that automatically applies a transparent inside-border to an image when it's uploaded?
[16:06:43] <LessSeen> aaronELBorg: is this what you want? http://jsfiddle.net/LessSeen/CXF4K/17/
[16:07:26] <Ricaz> Also, is it possible to make an overlay image that will be applied to another image? Like Overlay function in Photoshop
[16:08:02] <coldhead> Ricaz: no idea what you mean about the border thing but you can overlay images with absolute positioning and transparency in CSS
[16:08:06] <coldhead> it's not very photoshoppy
[16:09:59] <Ricaz> I guess I mean you basically resize the image, then apply another image on top of it (so it's one file)
[16:10:22] <coldhead> yeah that kind of thing you'll need to do in photoshop
[16:10:27] <coldhead> i'll show you what i'm talking about
[16:12:29] <coldhead> Ricaz: http://jsfiddle.net/K4Ytx/
[16:12:33] <coldhead> that's images overlayed
[16:12:37] <coldhead> kinda looks terrible
[16:12:45] <coldhead> but it IS two images
[16:12:55] <Ricaz> ah
[16:13:03] <Ricaz> well that looks nothing like what I want :D
[16:15:01] <coldhead> you probably want photoshop
[16:15:05] <Ricaz> It's because I'm making a CMS, and the client is able to switch out the photos in my header slide. But I want it to be easy, so the client can just upload ANY photo, and the same overlay and stroke will be applied as in the pics I put in.
[16:16:05] <Ricaz> this danmackay guy is getting annoying.
[16:16:48] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten, you around?
[16:18:08] <Whirl3d> drats. I am trying to implement an object literal to manage my methods and I can't figure out how I go about calling one method from another when defining them.
[16:18:21] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/xG66U/1/
[16:19:08] <Whirl3d> Fully commented source tthat I am starting from scratch....I get to the "nextContent" method where I need to call the currentContent() method and don't know how to do it.
[16:19:50] <Posterdati> is it possible to use svg as buttons in jquery?
[16:20:45] <shoky> Whirl3d: api.currentContent  no good?
[16:21:19] <Whirl3d> I'll try it again, but yesterday it didn't work --probably just me though. Lemme check
[16:27:08] <shoky> Whirl3d: hmm it's strange to me the way you're creating a new Gallery.. you call a constructor function with 'new' but you don't set any instance fields, and you return a local api object. so the new instance won't be of type 'Gallery'
[16:27:27] <shoky> but maybe i'm not familiar with this kind of.. construction
[16:28:06] <arungpt> does anyone have recommendation for an easy way to implement drag and drop file upload?
[16:28:49] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten set this up for me in a fiddle the other night and it seemed to work pretty well.
[16:29:17] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/mEGnt/
[16:29:26] <shoky> oks.. just know that this way  'gallery instanceof Gallery'  is false
[16:29:48] <Whirl3d> so, how would I do it differently?
[16:29:57] <Posterdati> is it possible to use svg as buttons in jquery?
[16:29:57] <Posterdati> is it possible to use svg as buttons in jquery?
[16:30:16] <Whirl3d> Posterdatl, look  it up in Google, nobody here knows.
[16:30:39] <shoky> Whirl3d:  this.currentContent = function(itm, opts) { ..... }; etc
[16:30:55] <shoky> and not return anything from that constructor
[16:31:07] <shoky> so the new instance is actually returned by the new operator
[16:31:20] <Posterdati> Whirl3d: lol
[16:31:22] <Whirl3d> strange, that's how I had it before.
[16:31:40] <Whirl3d> Once again, set astray by a girl...
[16:31:54] <shoky> that's the common approach for constructor functions and using 'new', donnos.
[16:32:30] <Whirl3d> but isn't "this" the window in that case
[16:32:34] <shoky> no
[16:32:38] <shoky> not if you call it with 'new'
[16:33:07] <Whirl3d> I reconfigured everything last night and got my head chewed off by someone here  saying that I was assigning evertyhing to the window object.
[16:33:33] <shoky> 'new' creates a new empty object with its prototype set, and runs your constructor function, binding 'this' to that new empty object
[16:33:42] <coldhead> i hope you thanked them for their grandmotherly kindness, Whirl3d
[16:34:07] <Whirl3d> so inside my function, the private methods will remain var statements and this.something for the public methods
[16:34:30] <Whirl3d> coldhead! I did, sort of, just before storming off and vowing never to come back. LOL
[16:35:29] <aaronELBorg> LessSeen, almost!
[16:35:51] <aaronELBorg> LessSeen, doesn't look like the 'selected' attr is getting set?
[16:36:12] <shoky> Whirl3d: yeah that should work i think
[16:37:07] <Whirl3d> but it's okay to set a varialble to 'this' like  gallery=this; gallery.doSomething=somefunc
[16:37:26] <shoky> Whirl3d: in your fiddles , the 'new' is superfluous
[16:38:05] <shoky> Whirl3d sure it's ok to do that
[16:39:30] <shoky> Whirl3d: but if you do it inside of another function you need to be careful, best to just cache it at first. (i do this in most of my constructors as 1st line: var self=this;)
[16:40:16] <shoky> sometimes i like a more descriptive name than 'self' tho
[16:40:25] <shoky> gtg.byz
[16:40:30] <Whirl3d> cool. bye
[16:40:31] <Whirl3d> thanks
[16:40:35] <coldhead> my people prefer me - this;
[16:40:42] <coldhead> me = this; // even
[16:40:50] <coldhead> me.whatever() grosses me out
[16:40:55] <Whirl3d> your slave drivers? Still working too hard?
[16:41:00] <coldhead> always
[16:41:40] <Whirl3d> what have you been working on?
[16:47:26] <Ricaz> Anyone have any experience using Pixastic?

[17:00:49] <dsyme> well, nm im dumb
[17:00:54] <species> Ricaz: security error
[17:01:07] <Ricaz> :S
[17:01:09] <dsyme> i should just add a 1 second delay before showing the overlay
[17:01:10] <species> Ricaz: are you using firebug or somethign similar?
[17:01:22] <Ricaz> species chrome
[17:01:33] <species> in FF I get a security error. Dont know why.
[17:02:00] <coldhead> i get it one in chrome

[17:02:03] <coldhead> "Uncaught Error: SECURITY_ERR: DOM Exception 18"
[17:02:12] <coldhead> probably because it's across domains
[17:02:20] <coldhead> see if it works better on the same server
[17:02:40] <Ricaz> What?
[17:02:51] <Ricaz> The two pictures?
[17:02:56] <Ricaz> The plugin?
[17:03:18] <Ricaz> ah the plugin triggers the error
[17:16:35] <Posterdati> hi
[17:17:07] <Posterdati> please I've to place clickable points on an svg how can I solve this with jquery? Thanks
[17:25:32] <catcher> I'm grabbing a string from html, and it's coming back with %E2%80%93 instead of a "-" character. What's the best way to convert this for a string compare?
[17:29:09] <Valid> catcher: decodeURIComponent('%E2%80%93')
[17:29:18] <Valid> >> decodeURIComponent('%E2%80%93')
[17:29:23] <Valid> dang, no bot here?
[17:29:31] <shoky> ?js decodeURIComponent('%E2%80%93')
[17:29:33] <bot-t> shoky: "–"
[17:29:37] <Valid> ah, ty
[17:29:39] <steveoliver> If I have var myjQueryObject = "$(this).value()";, how can I use it?  it just prints as that text, doesn't evaluate to the actual jQuery object.
[17:30:02] <shoky> steveoliver you mean val() ?
[17:30:04] <catcher> Valid, hmm, it may not always be the same special character though..
[17:30:13] <steveoliver> yeah
[17:30:14] <LessSeen> it shouldn't be inside a string ""
[17:30:38] <shoky> steveoliver: .val() gets the value attribute of the element (which is text)
[17:31:03] <shoky> the actual jquery object is just $(this)
[17:31:41] <steveoliver> my question is: How do I reference a jQuery object which is defined by a string variable ?
[17:31:48] <shoky> wat
[17:31:54] <shoky> what do you mean..
[17:32:10] <steveoliver> Such as "S('select[name=product_type]')"
[17:32:15] <steveoliver> Such as "$('select[name=product_type]')"
[17:32:33] <steveoliver> i have that as a variable passed in from a calling function..
[17:32:34] <shoky> how is that defined by a string variable? and what's the issue with referencing it ?
[17:32:51] <steveoliver> that is the string value of a variable myjQueryObject.
[17:32:59] <shoky> uh you have a string of javascript code ?
[17:33:26] <steveoliver> yeah, var myjQueryObject = "$('select[name=product_type]')";
[17:33:48] <shoky> you'd need eval() or some equivalent...
[17:34:03] <steveoliver> the var is set inside an array of values, passed into the function wishing to reference the jQuery object.
[17:34:07] <steveoliver> eval(), ok
[17:34:18] <LessSeen> can't imagine why you would need to do it that way though
[17:34:23] <shoky> usually it's not a good idea to do that though..
[17:34:56] <steveoliver> I understand
[17:35:28] <steveoliver> not a coincidence it is only one letter different than 'evil'
[17:35:37] <steveoliver> ;)
[17:35:44] <shoky> ;>
[17:46:38] <g0bl1n> can Firefox still not read mouse event offsetX and offsetY ??
[17:47:47] <chilversc> are those the 2 ones that chrome always generates a depricated warning for?
[17:48:12] <chilversc> ah no, those are layerX and layerY
[17:50:52] <Whirl3d> shoky, once again your help has saved the day. I finally got the very first baby step of my gallery working thanks to you. Plus I undertstand it a lot better now, thanks so much.
[17:52:37] <Ukto> why would $('.faqcat').live( 'click', function(){
[17:52:47] <Ukto> not triggie all divs with faqcat class ?
[17:52:52] <Ukto> from them even
[17:52:53] <innociv_> layerX and layerY are depreciated in webkit too
[17:53:47] <jedimind> vladikoff, stop slacking off
[17:54:33] <Ukto> nm, wasn external script causing issues
[17:56:59] <shoky> Whirl3d awesome ;]
[18:01:13] <Whirl3d> now if i can just get my mini pubsub to work correctly, I'll be in business.
[18:03:03] <shoky> btw Whirl3d, if you don't wanna write  'this.fn = function() {...}'  instead of having an object literal with { fn: function() { ... } }
[18:04:13] <shoky> you can do:  function Gallery() { }   $.extend(Gallery.prototype,  {  fn: function() { ... }, name: 'untitled', ... } )
[18:05:10] <Whirl3d> that's how I am going to implement the plugin features I believe
[18:05:56] <Whirl3d> I'll provide the base which loads the config info from mySQL and builds the basic "slides"/provide next/prev/select/etc. and then everything else will plugin.
[18:06:09] <Whirl3d> for thumbnails, backgrounds, modal popups, etc.
[18:06:33] <shoky> sweet ;]
[18:07:11] <Whirl3d> And I'll make sure that your name and anything else you want is in the comments for credit.
[18:08:57] <Whirl3d> unless of course it turns out bad and you'd rather not   lol
[18:10:16] <briansoule> hello jquery
[18:10:37] <Blaster> Hi guys, just wondering if this is the wrong way to attach a keyup handler to multiple elements?  I want to do the same thing whether each of them are clicked.
[18:10:40] <Blaster> $('.knowledgeBaseSearchForm .textBox, .newTicketForm textarea').keyup()
[18:11:04] <briansoule> does anyone know how to automatically increase the width of a <textarea> instead of word wrapping?
[18:11:43] <briansoule> Blaster: have you tested it?
[18:12:02] <briansoule> i'd check w3schools for css
[18:12:07] <Blaster> biansoule: yes
[18:12:11] <Whirl3d> biransoule, that's a tricky one that is hard to implement, actually. There's a plugin that does some of that, but it involves monitoring keystrokes and caclulating characterwidths...kinda ugly
[18:12:37] <briansoule> what's it called?
[18:12:54] <Blaster> I figured out my problem, I used $('#elem1').add('#elem2').keyup();
[18:12:57] <Whirl3d> not sure. just look for jquery expanding text area
[18:13:30] <Whirl3d> i'll see if I can find the one I have used...brb
[18:13:37] <briansoule> hahaha
[18:13:39] <briansoule> thanks
[18:14:16] <briansoule> it seems like support is increasingly conveying the correct phrase to google
[18:15:07] <Whirl3d> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10826305/jq-auto-grow-text-area-issues-delaying-expansion-padding-issue
[18:15:44] <Whirl3d> it helps to ask here for experience...google has lots of results, but no experience. At least here you get people's input on what is good or not.
[18:16:59] <Whirl3d> but that's vertical expansion.  you can probably use that a a base for horizontal expansion with some minor changes.
[18:17:39] <Ukto> why would $(this).parent().children().each(function(){ $(this).toggle('fast'); });  toggle the parent as well as the children ?
[18:18:10] <Ukto> i expected it to .each children()
[18:18:18] <Ukto> i guess its part of this
[18:18:18] <Ukto> heh
[18:18:19] <Ukto> n/m
[18:18:33] <briansoule> yeah, there seems to be lots of help on the vertical resizing
[18:19:24] <Whirl3d> is there a css thing you could do to make it autosize?
[18:22:30] <Whirl3d> though this would be a little ugly,  you could copy the value of the text in the textarea to an autoexpanding div that had opacity set to 0 and left set to -99999 (offscreen). Then get the resultant width and expand if necessary
[18:29:22] <briansoule> Whirl3d: that's an interesting thought
[18:34:07] <briansoule> Whirl3d: i found someone who has an unlimited textarea width, and adjusts the surrounding div to appear as that width
[18:35:15] <Whirl3d> that sounds more reasonable, but how do you get the width of the current state of the textarea?
[19:15:43] <shoky> plop
[19:16:26] <tw2113> yo shoky
[19:16:43] <shoky> hy buddy
[19:16:52] <shoky> wazup
[19:17:05] <tw2113> putting off work
[19:17:22] <shoky> oh im good at that
[19:19:16] <shoky> you work with/for mozilla?
[19:20:40] <tw2113> nope
[19:21:00] <tw2113> i contribute to MDN a bit
[19:21:02] <tw2113> but that's about it
[19:21:09] <flaggy> hello. When using .hide and .show, if I want the element to load as hidden I use display: none. However, I don't know how to make .show to change that to display: block (the element default is inline).
[19:21:09] <shoky> hmm maybe i'm thinking of someone else :S
[19:21:38] <tw2113> they did fly me into Cali in late April, community meetup thing for MDN
[19:21:53] <shoky> ah maybe it was that
[19:26:17] <shoky> flaggy: you can't make .show change it to something else. just use .css
[19:26:27] <shoky> flaggy: or classes
[19:30:44] <Maishoku> anyone here with ideas on how to parse a json that contains an array and 2 separate properties?
[19:33:15] <species> so, the json file is not valid json?
[19:33:23] <species> you want to sepeatley parse bits of it?
[19:35:34] <Maishoku> it looks like this: {"name":"Weight","color":"#00cb3e","data":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]}
[19:35:55] <Maishoku> jquery's jsonparse captures the name and color property, but fails the parse the data property correctly
[19:37:06] <jaypitidi> is it possible to remove a css selector like {#mainNav ul li:hover ul} with jquery?
[19:40:28] <shoky> Maishoku why do you say it fails?
[19:40:46] <shoky> *what makes you say
[19:41:06] <Maishoku> when trying to access the data property, it shows up as undefined
[19:41:15] <shoky> ?js $.parseJSON('{"name":"Weight","color":"#00cb3e","data":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]}').data
[19:41:16] <bot-t> shoky: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
[19:41:24] <shoky> works fine
[19:41:31] <briansoule> Whirl3d: can't you detect the number of characters?
[19:42:40] <Whirl3d> briansoule, sure but the | takes up considerably less space than W for example
[19:44:19] <Whirl3d> is there a builtin Deferred method that lets you return a resolved or rejected promise in one action?
[19:44:30] <Maishoku> hmm guess i was doing something strange, thanks for checking up on that
[19:44:40] <Ukto> hello Maishoku
[19:44:43] <Ukto> You seem awfully familiar
[19:44:59] <Whirl3d> return a promise to a Deferred that was rejected or resolved, sorry.
[19:46:02] <shoky> hmm whatcha mean Whirl3d?
[19:46:34] <Whirl3d> I have several functions that return promises...but sometimes I resolve or reject the deferred before returning the promise..
[19:46:51] <Whirl3d> so sometimes, I would like to do that in one command....like this:
[19:47:06] <Whirl3d> if (!itm.length) return rejectedPromise
[19:47:25] <shoky> what's itm
[19:47:32] <Whirl3d> some param in a function
[19:47:59] <shoky> i dont understand ;S
[19:48:10] <Whirl3d> otherwise I have to do if (!itm.length) {var def=$.Deferred(). def.reject(); return def.promise();}
[19:48:29] <Whirl3d> I'll fiddle it
[19:48:31] <shoky> oh
[19:49:18] <shoky> return $.Deferred().reject().promise()  ?
[19:50:32] <shoky> ?js $.fn.jquery
[19:50:32] <bot-t> shoky: "1.4.2"
[19:51:39] <shoky> Whirl3d though if what you're gonna do with the returned promises is just put then into $.when or something, then you could just return true/false
[19:52:22] <shoky> hmm scratch that ;S
[19:56:57] <Whirl3d> well, I can never figure out my css correctly, but here's the concept: http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/6btJY/1/

[20:06:07] <shoky> Whirl3d: you need to return the promise if you want the function to return a promise :P
[20:06:27] <Whirl3d> if the interface is the same for the promise or the deferred, it doesnt matter
[20:06:42] <Whirl3d> only if the deferrred is resoled or rejected
[20:06:48] <shoky> well since it's already rejected i guess so
[20:06:58] <Bernie665> whirl
[20:06:59] <shoky> but still "cleaner" to return the promise
[20:07:00] <Whirl3d> because then there's no risk of something outside rejecting or resolving it.
[20:07:02] <scrananis> hello. how can i get the bottom of the window's position relative to the document?
[20:07:11] <Bernie665> am trying to export a logo, txt+image
[20:07:25] <Bernie665> its for web format
[20:07:38] <Bernie665> without getting grainy edges
[20:07:41] <Bernie665> or colour loss
[20:07:47] <shoky> Bernie665: no you dont need that setTimeout :\
[20:08:02] <shoky> Bernie665: change:  window.setTimeout(getUsersLocation, 2000);
[20:08:10] <Bernie665> u sure?i thought we found something about needing it in the google code
[20:08:10] <shoky> Bernie665:  to:   getUsersLocation();
[20:08:16] <shoky> Bernie665: i am sure
[20:08:23] <psyolus> is parent().length a good way to tell if something has been inserted into the document?
[20:08:24] <shoky> i even explaineed it to you
[20:08:28] <Whirl3d> depending on the image, you most likely will want to use the file menu save for web & devices and select png24 if you have transparency
[20:08:45] <Bernie665> i can use black background
[20:08:54] <gianbalex> scrananis, you need to get the height of window, for the bottom.
[20:08:56] <Bernie665> it actually doesnt matter in this instance , yet
[20:08:59] <Whirl3d> but technically you could use .svg, but it's not widely supported or understood..
[20:09:25] <Bernie665> access wise thats not good rite?
[20:09:26] <Whirl3d> then save it as jpg with max quality
[20:09:29] <gianbalex> if you want to get the "bottom space"
[20:09:36] <gianbalex> is another question :)
[20:09:51] <scrananis> gianbalex: i mean relative to the top of the window when it's not scrolled
[20:09:58] <scrananis> i need to account for scrolling too
[20:10:14] <scrananis> sorry i should have mentioned that
[20:10:24] <Bernie665> shoky i fixed that :) sorry bout that
[20:10:43] <shoky> yay ;D
[20:10:50] <Bernie665> wat about scale
[20:10:56] <shoky> now i can find me with no delay
[20:11:02] <gianbalex> jQuery(window).scrollTop()
[20:11:03] <Bernie665> should i be setting the logo as the scale i want for the browser
[20:11:07] <gianbalex> scrananis, jQuery(window).scrollTop()
[20:11:10] <Bernie665> lol
[20:11:17] <Bernie665> does it still find ur place roughly?
[20:11:39] <shoky> psyolus: no that's not a good way
[20:11:48] <gianbalex> scrananis, http://api.jquery.com/scrollTop/
[20:11:48] <Whirl3d> Bernie665, yes. It's a good idea to make it the right scale if possible.
[20:11:54] <psyolus> shoky: What would you recommend?
[20:12:17] <Bernie665> what annoys me is, if i zoom in in google chrome, or other browser the edges are clearly not smooth
[20:12:25] <Bernie665> is that completely normal
[20:12:41] <Bernie665> or is there a way to compact the dpi so it remains nice quality
[20:12:46] <Whirl3d> yes. You can apply anti-aliasing using some of the svg filters to resolve that
[20:13:08] <Whirl3d> but it's better to bring it into photoshop and have photoshop anti-alias your edges for you.
[20:13:11] <Bernie665> svg filters :S  is that in illustrator ?
[20:13:16] <Whirl3d> yes
[20:13:21] <Whirl3d> unfortunately.
[20:13:25] <shoky> psyolus: not sure what's best, but what you suggested won't work here for example:  var a = $('<div>'), b = $('<span>'); a.append(b);  b.parent().length == 1
[20:13:26] <Bernie665> i was told never do type in photoshop
[20:13:33] <Bernie665> which is why i have avoided it so far
[20:13:36] <Whirl3d> bah
[20:13:50] <Whirl3d> You can do type in photoshop so long as you know what you are doing
[20:13:52] <Bernie665> so am unsure, testing has proven wierd results
[20:13:57] <psyolus> Ah.
[20:14:13] <Whirl3d> Do you have a link to the graphic? I could better advise you if I could see it.
[20:14:44] <Bernie665> sure 1 sec
[20:15:29] <gianbalex> shoky, .length == 1 it's not true.  if(b.parent().length>0) return "the parent exists";
[20:16:12] <Bernie665> here we go: http://www.highaccess.nl/img/ha.png
[20:16:13] <shoky> gianbalex: what?
[20:16:31] <shoky> psyolus: i'd just do $(document).find( myElement ).length
[20:17:26] <Whirl3d> Bernie665, do you consider that jaggie around the edges?
[20:17:28] <shoky> or myElement.closest('body')  could be more performant, donno
[20:17:36] <Bernie665> well thats full scale png
[20:17:41] <Bernie665> let me show u an export
[20:17:46] <Bernie665> i thought u meant the original lol
[20:19:23] <Whirl3d> what typeface is that?
[20:19:49] <Bernie665> exported at screen: http://www.highaccess.nl/img/ha1.png
[20:19:58] <Bernie665> its not nice is it
[20:20:09] <Bernie665> have to check original files
[20:20:16] <Bernie665> i converted to outlines :S
[20:20:54] <Whirl3d> you are looking at a tiny stroke around those leaves...it's not gonna get too much better unless you go with svg
[20:21:17] <Bernie665> oh the stroke wasnt the prob, its the text
[20:21:28] <Bernie665> zoom in watch it quickly blur
[20:21:30] <Ukto> I am trrying to iterate through json, and if the json is not sequenced and starting at 0, .length does not work. i have 10=blah,14=something,42=universe  and I need to iterate through the 3, and be able to use key & val ideas?
[20:21:48] <shoky> Ukto: jsfiddle it please
[20:22:11] <Whirl3d> try doubling the size of your export and sizing it on the web
[20:22:57] <Bernie665> is it ok to have a 300x300px image and set the width+height html elements to 150px ?
[20:23:18] <shoky> Ukto: $.each ?
[20:23:29] <Whirl3d> sometimes it works great. sometimes it sucks.
[20:23:36] <Whirl3d> I'd try it and see
[20:24:00] <Bernie665> am gonna re export then put on site see how it looks properly
[20:24:22] <Whirl3d> btw, you can still tell the font after outlines by looking in your font menu..the top fonts will be the ones used in your file
[20:24:58] <Ukto> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/8jfg8/
[20:26:33] <Ukto> i tried $.each() and that didnt work either :/
[20:27:55] <Bernie665> eurofurence
[20:37:04] <Whirl3d> Bernie665, you really should investigate the svg option for your logo. It's the future of web graphics and it's a simple test case for your site.
[20:37:46] <Whirl3d> I have to run, but I'll check back with you when I return...bye all. Thanks again shoky!
[20:38:03] <Bernie665> back
[20:38:27] <Bernie665> ill have a look into this svg
[20:38:38] <Bernie665> i gotta go myself,
[20:38:41] <Bernie665> take it easy people
[20:56:51] <Ukto> moo
[21:01:08] <brettfrable> meteor.js
[21:03:27] <Afflicto> Hello all. I was just wondering how jquery ajax really works when it comes to security. I have added 2 post variables to every single ajax post with $_SESSION['auth_un']and $_SESSION['auth_pw']. So basically it logs in with the username and password of the client. Is this a secure way of doing it?
[21:05:45] <Illusioneer> ok i have a use for a kinetic js function, it takes data in a json object and creates a series of points on a grid.  however if I use this function as a callback, it does not generate any of the points.  If I call it like a normal function with the same data it works fine.  is there something in jquery or using it as a callback that might be screwing this up?
[21:15:41] <shoky> Ukto: check your console logs.. you didnt close the $.each(   with  );    http://jsfiddle.net/8jfg8/1/
[21:15:57] <Ukto> yeah, i just found that a sec ago
[21:15:59] <Ukto> thanks :)
[21:16:03] <shoky> ;p
[21:16:22] <Ukto> although...
[21:16:33] <shoky> Illusioneer: best if you jsfiddle it
[21:16:38] <Ukto> can you give me some quick help with basic math? http://jsfiddle.net/6HHwa/1/
[21:17:18] <Illusioneer> shoky: i can but the data feed is on my internal network
[21:17:56] <shoky> Illusioneer: i cant understand from your description what you're doing and what the problem is
[21:18:08] <shoky> Illusioneer: doesn't matter what data you put in the fiddle...
[21:18:26] <shoky> as long as it demonstrates the issue
[21:18:56] <Illusioneer> shocky: http://jsfiddle.net/TN3GA/
[21:18:59] <shoky> Ukto: what do you wanna do? didnt understand what you wrote there
[21:19:32] <Ukto> need the values to multiple (inclding decimal places) up to 5 places
[21:20:01] <Ukto> i am thinking parseInt() is restricting the decimal places, but i was having issues doing the math w/o it
[21:22:59] <Illusioneer> shoky: yes the code's a bit raw looking, i'm just trying to get this concept to work first :)
[21:23:52] <shoky> Illusioneer that's ok. cleaner like this though: http://jsfiddle.net/TN3GA/1/
[21:25:03] <Illusioneer> neat or sloppy, it's not working, if it gets feed from a local variable it works fine, but pulling the json objet from the server it returns no errors but it still doesn't work
[21:25:18] <Illusioneer> it shows none of the points on the canvas
[21:25:48] <shoky> if its sloppy its harder for me to help you, no?
[21:27:29] <Illusioneer> if you don't know it's ok to say so :)
[21:28:50] <shoky> hm? if i knew i'd tell you the solution, no?
[21:28:57] <shoky> i dont know YET.
[21:29:26] <Illusioneer> it's rather baffling, that json block in the code is pulled straight from the web api
[21:30:02] <Illusioneer> the getjson call works fine, it'll do my console.log of all the ID's so it is running and there's no errors at all when i use the getJson way
[21:30:07] <Illusioneer> it just doesn't render anything
[21:30:34] <Illusioneer> but if I put the data into a variable in the JS it works
[21:32:07] <shoky> yeah i can see the issue when just using setTimeout
[21:32:36] <Illusioneer> http://jsfiddle.net/TN3GA/1/
[21:32:53] <Illusioneer> i pointed my router so you can see it from the data feed
[21:36:50] <Illusioneer> helps when i update :)
[21:36:51] <Illusioneer> http://jsfiddle.net/TN3GA/2/
[21:36:53] <shoky> it works if you put  stage.add(shapesLayer);   at the end of tri_again
[21:38:01] <Illusioneer> hmmm why does it need it one way but not the other?
[21:38:16] <shoky> oh
[21:38:21] <shoky> it also works if you put stage.draw()
[21:38:40] <shoky> Illusioneer: because it needs to be redrawn
[21:39:06] <shoky> ah just put:  shapesLayer.draw()
[21:39:14] <shoky> best way i suppose
[21:39:14] <Illusioneer> at the end of tr_again?
[21:39:15] <shoky> yeah
[21:39:28] <Illusioneer> sweet, errors are easier to fix if you.. well get an error :)
[21:39:43] <shoky> there was no error ;)
[21:39:53] <Illusioneer> i know LOL
[21:40:06] <shoky> it was just expecting an explicit re-draw instruction from you ;p
[21:40:18] <shoky> which is usually how stuff like that works
[21:40:21] <Illusioneer> it should have asked, I would have cheerfully accomodated it :)
[21:40:26] <shoky> their docs SUCK though
[21:40:36] <Illusioneer> i'm still very green with canvas and kinetic
[21:40:45] <Illusioneer> yeah the examples are rather sparse
[21:40:48] <shoky> i've never used either ;p
[21:40:59] <Illusioneer> well my game calls for mapping
[21:41:11] <Illusioneer> and there was no project even remotely like what i needed
[21:41:14] <shoky> ya im not saying they're not useful ;P
[21:41:38] <Illusioneer> sadly, the only game in town that i know of
[21:42:56] <Illusioneer> yay it works, now off to the next bit of code
[21:43:02] <Illusioneer> you rock shok
[21:43:14] <shoky> ;] thnx
[21:47:32] <psyolus> Anyone have a nice pattern for matching URLs?
[21:56:03] <Whirl3d> easy way to take an array of elements and turn them into a jquery object while maintaining their order?
[21:59:01] <MKC> hey does the $.ajax({ error: function(xhr, a,b) {}}) return the JSON that the servers sends back? Is there a way to get the JSON object that the server sends back on error?
[22:00:46] <systemfault> :D
[22:00:49] <systemfault> Weekend!
[22:01:57] <rodd> shh not for me
[22:02:01] <rodd> =\
[22:02:39] <rodd> actually it doesn't change the fact that we're on a weekend
[22:02:49] <rodd> just that I won't be able to relax
[22:03:16] <systemfault> That's unfortunate :/
[22:03:29] <systemfault> Are you off on sunday though?
[22:04:02] <rodd> working on a side project with a tight deadline
[22:04:04] <MKC> rodd: work is not a rabbit. It won't run away
[22:04:43] <systemfault> I will never work on a weekend for an employer again..
[22:04:49] <systemfault> It's never worth it.
[22:05:02] <rodd> 2am im here since 10am
[22:05:26] <MKC> rodd: only time ill work like that is for myself
[22:05:31] <tw2113> best part about freelancing, you can make your weekend whatever 2 days you want
[22:05:50] <rodd> the only reason im doing this is because i believe in the project
[22:05:58] <rodd> great people involved
[22:06:02] <MKC> rodd: fair enough
[22:06:03] <systemfault> Stability sucks with freelancing :/
[22:06:07] <rodd> otherwise no way
[22:06:34] <systemfault> rodd: If you end up really benefitting of that, it's great
[22:06:49] <rodd> but you get to a time where your mind doesn't respond well anymore
[22:09:03] <MKC> rodd: tell me about it. My progress rate from 9 to 11 was a multiple compared to 11 to 1
[22:09:48] <MKC> ehh, time to sleep
[22:09:53] <systemfault> Already? :D
[22:10:02] <rodd> same for me, I'm being unproductive
[22:10:08] <systemfault> :)
[22:10:14] <MKC> cya guys
[22:10:16] <systemfault> Sleep well guys
[22:10:20] <rodd> later
[22:11:56] * systemfault feels forever alone in a 752 members channel..
[22:13:20] <Whirl3d> huh?
[22:15:45] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/YU4JM/20/
[22:16:22] <Whirl3d> can someone explain why var newboxList=boxList.slice(5,1) returns 1 ?
[22:16:49] <Whirl3d> wait, not it returns an html element. lol
[22:18:43] <shoky> derp
[22:19:59] <systemfault> herp
[22:31:40] <Whirl3d> doh! Why does jquery re-order it's collections?
[22:35:56] <Whirl3d> okay and wow. .before detatches the element from the dom and then attempts to append it, but if it can't find a place to append it (because of a bad selector or what have you) it just disappears. LOL
[22:38:01] <systemfault> Ah :/
[22:38:33] <Whirl3d> wow, I also feel like before and after have the wrong context
[22:38:58] <Whirl3d> I feel like it should be a shortcut for appendBefore and appendAfter
[22:39:20] <systemfault> o_O
[22:39:25] <Whirl3d> in which case the context would be the element you are moving  and the parameter would be where you wanted to move it to
[22:39:46] <Whirl3d> put this before that would be $(this).before(that)    not $(that).before(this);
[22:42:15] <Whirl3d> that way you also wouldn't lose elements if you had a bad parameter...$(this).before(badparam) would just leave this alone...whereas $(badparam).before(this) detaches this...?
[22:54:56] <shoky> ya the before/after api is not as naturally readable as most jquery stuff
[23:05:28] <sacho> uhh
[23:05:38] <sacho> why are you using before() and after() with a parameter a lready attached to the dom?
[23:09:29] <Whirl3d> need to reorder some elements
[23:15:20] <scathen^C> hey guys is there an easy way to take html and convert it to text, but preserve line breaks (taking p,div,etc into consideration)
[23:20:51] <sacho> sure
[23:27:51] <ENQ> hey
[23:27:54] <Whirl3d> anybody know if an eclipse library for jquery exists?
[23:29:25] <ENQ> i have a question about plugins, do i have to use $.fn.extend({plugin_nam:function(opts){ //all plugin stuffs go here } })
[23:29:55] <ENQ> or its same as $.fn.plugin_name = function(opts) { //all plugins stuffs gos here }
[23:31:31] <Whirl3d> they are pretty much  the same thing, I believe
[23:32:10] <ENQ> ok, thought so, wasnt shure :)
[23:33:27] <Whirl3d> but isn't it $.extend($.fn, plugin); ?
[23:33:41] <ENQ> another question if i can, where should i put stuffs witch should be same for all this plugin instances
[23:33:50] <ENQ> yes, saw this too
[23:33:58] <ENQ> but idk, works this way too
[23:34:06] <Whirl3d> in a closure
[23:34:41] <sacho> ENQ, all three would do similar things if plugin_nam wasn't defined
[23:34:53] <Whirl3d> (function ($) { private stuff shared by all? $.fn.plug=function (etc){ }   })(jQuery);
[23:34:54] <ENQ> non of seen examples says why they use one or other declaration style
[23:35:22] <sacho> personal preference to the syntax?
[23:35:30] <sacho> $.fn.plugin_name should be fastest
[23:35:34] <Whirl3d> It's easier to extend multiple functions using extend
[23:35:54] <sacho> but it doesn't handle merge situations, which is what extend() is really about
[23:36:12] <Whirl3d> meaning?
[23:36:17] <ENQ> so then i should usse extend
[23:36:41] <sacho> ..why? if your plugin doesn't exist in $.fn..
[23:36:46] <sacho> there's nothing to merge
[23:36:54] <ENQ> oh
[23:37:56] <sacho> $.extend($.fn, plugin1, plugin2, plugin3) <-- allows that kind of call, unlike $.extend(plugin, /* can't specify more */);
[23:38:06] <sacho> $.fn.extend() in the second
[23:38:47] <ENQ> i see
[23:39:23] <ENQ> maybe got example witch would be recomended? with default options
[23:39:51] <ENQ> i have read some and they all seems to offer different solutions
[23:43:10] <Whirl3d> ENQ, here is a link that might help: http://bitovi.com/blog/2010/10/writing-the-perfect-jquery-plugin.html
[23:44:09] <ENQ> thanks i will read it :)
