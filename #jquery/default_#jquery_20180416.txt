[03:55:39] <k0nichiwa> with datatables widget, if you feed it JSON data, how do youy tell it you want cells to have certain from input elements ?
[03:55:50] <k0nichiwa> just a pointer to docs i should look at woudl help
[03:56:13] <k0nichiwa> i look at the docs and im expecting to find how to provide a call back or something .. they try to make it look so simple they dont want to get into details
[03:56:18] <k0nichiwa> or im just being stupid
[04:53:51] <_braindead> hello peeps. i try to add a small snippet to some jquery code and not sure if i placed it correct (syntax wise). https://jsfiddle.net/uhqs041w/ << the part at the bottom that is commented datepicker
[05:20:50] <onla> I want to include html in another html file. I looked at html imports, but it seems to be not supported by firefox yet, or the code I tried didn't work there but worked on qutebrowser. Should I use jquery, or is there a more lightweight solution? The load() function is deprecated it seems?
[06:37:08] <billybo> hello - How can I get the referrer url on page load?
[06:38:06] <billybo> when I say referrer I mean the original referrer (there could be multiple referrals leading to my site, but I want the original source).
[06:38:50] <Woet> billybo: document.referrer
[06:41:06] <billybo> Woet: does that definitely get the original referrer and not just the last of many in-between referrers?
[06:41:37] <Woet> billybo: the original referrer isn't sent to you.
[06:43:10] <billybo> it isn't (security reasons?) -- if not then how do I return a user back to the previous page?
[06:45:10] <Woet> billybo: sent it to the URL
[06:45:14] <Woet> billybo: or store it in a cookie, session, etc. what are you trying to do?
[06:46:36] <billybo> basically, someone links to my site. Upon entering a modal pops up giving 2 options. One of the options should send them back to the previous page.
[06:46:45] <billybo> Woet:  ^
[06:47:14] <billybo> seems like a basi operation .... but I can't find a clear way to do this
[06:51:49] <billybo> anyone?
[07:00:23] <preference> hello. can someone please tell me what the name of the window is when you "inspect element", and where i might be able to find out more information about it? i'm guessing it's per-browser, but is there a standardised list of basic functionality i can find?
[07:01:29] <_braindead> can someone help me with the syntax? i want to add the line of code (see html part) into the code part below. where would i place it? https://jsfiddle.net/5g86m0zn/
[07:03:05] <_braindead> do you mean developer tools, preference
[07:03:35] <preference> _braindead: oh, it's just called that. thanks
[07:04:36] <_braindead> np
[07:04:45] <preference> _braindead: idk, just put a jquery listener in for when the element is no longer active?
[07:05:31] <preference> or maybe i'm misunderstanding entirely. sorry :)
[07:05:58] <_braindead> i literally want to know at what place i copy it into the code. the line is already working like that
[07:15:03] <preference> i mean... tell me if i'm wrong, not an expert, but all that line does is check if the input in the box is a date, and, if not, open the datepicker. if that's the case, just add it wherever you want, it's not like it matters. you just need an event listener, right?
[07:16:02] <_braindead> right
[07:16:32] <_braindead> but i dont know where to place it
[07:16:49] <_braindead> safari browser dont shows up a datepicker no matter what
[07:18:54] <preference> https://caniuse.com/#search=datepicker
[07:20:25] <_braindead> yeahr i know
[07:20:36] <_braindead> thats why i want to add a jquery date picker for safari
[07:21:06] <_braindead> also this looks very promising: https://www.tjvantoll.com/2012/06/30/creating-a-native-html5-datepicker-with-a-fallback-to-jquery-ui/ .. but i dont get it either
[07:27:14] <preference> maybe Cork can help, i'm lost on what your issue is
[07:29:47] <_braindead> no worries. i have a datepicker  (type="date") which is not supported by safari. so i want a different datepicker when this html5 type is not supported
[07:29:55] <preference> i understand what the issue is
[07:29:57] <_braindead> for example this here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30503195/html-5-input-type-date-not-working-in-firefox
[07:29:59] <preference> i don't understand what your problem is
[07:30:06] <preference> because you can put the code anywhere you want
[07:30:14] <_braindead> show me please
[07:30:28] <_braindead> i cant get it to work
[07:30:30] <preference> i can't show you because the code doesn't seem to work for me, i'm taking your word for it that it does work
[07:30:52] <_braindead> see.. its not working for me too. but the internet says it does
[07:31:04] <_braindead> and also this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/2AaFk/1/
[07:35:58] <preference> ok
[07:36:34] <preference> that fiddle you just linked does indeed work.
[07:36:45] <preference> so just copy/paste that code wherever you need it to be
[07:36:46] <preference> 1 sec
[07:37:04] <preference> http://jsfiddle.net/0us5fth8/
[07:37:57] <preference> but bear in mind that this only works on jquery 1.9.1 for me
[07:42:47] <_braindead> same here. not working on different jquery versions. that might be the problem
[07:43:22] <_braindead> do you know how this could work: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30503195/html-5-input-type-date-not-working-in-firefox
[07:43:30] <preference> the weird thing is that if you change the jquery version back to 1.9.1, it still doesn't work
[07:43:31] <_braindead> i guess i need to import mordernizr someho
[07:44:43] <_braindead> i can approve that as well on my side
[08:03:23] <_braindead> it can be so easy but i guess only with old jquery version. https://www.tjvantoll.com/demos/2012-06-30/date .. is there a problem using an old version?
[08:14:11] <preference> _braindead: not per se, though it will get outdated at some point
[08:14:43] <_braindead> cant believe there is no solution to get safari a datepicker
[08:14:52] <preference> e-mail apple
[08:22:48] <rinpoche> hi, I've downloaded this repo https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js and I want to try the demo but it is giving me error 'ReferenceError: particlesJS is not defined'. How can I debug it?
[08:23:00] <rinpoche> I'm new to this, sorry
[09:12:09] <JohnnyMcAffey> Hey guys! Can anyone help with quick helps?
[09:12:23] <JohnnyMcAffey> I have FORM with plenty of input fields.
[09:12:36] <JohnnyMcAffey> When i edit some of the fields - it appends class "edited"
[09:14:05] <ryan_ford> like angular's dirty inputs?
[09:14:05] <preference> where?
[09:14:47] <JohnnyMcAffey> So...
[09:14:53] <JohnnyMcAffey> HTML + Jquery
[09:15:21] <JohnnyMcAffey> Now i have like - two fields - A & B with class edited.
[09:15:32] <JohnnyMcAffey> i map through .edited class
[09:15:34] <JohnnyMcAffey> or each
[09:15:58] <JohnnyMcAffey> but console log returns me only one of the inputs - A or B, but not both in same time.
[09:19:42] <preference> what are you talkinga bout
[09:19:49] <preference> can you make a jsfiddle?
[09:20:24] <preference> _braindead: did you find a solution yet?
[09:28:10] <JohnnyMcAffey> Yes, i will do a jsfiddle.
[09:30:09] <AdamPDotty> scope issue, scope issue
[09:30:14] <_braindead> no preference
[09:40:58] <JohnnyMcAffey> Here you guys:
[09:40:58] <JohnnyMcAffey> https://jsfiddle.net/mqe2q2op/
[09:41:11] <JohnnyMcAffey> @preference
[09:41:33] <Woet> JohnnyMcAffey: a working test case please.
[09:42:14] <JohnnyMcAffey> https://jsfiddle.net/mqe2q2op/2/ - this one works.
[09:42:18] <JohnnyMcAffey> Forgot to add libs.
[09:42:41] <JohnnyMcAffey> Check Console
[09:43:27] <Woet> JohnnyMcAffey: I'm only getting them once.
[09:43:34] <preference> ++
[09:43:59] <JohnnyMcAffey> Ok - edit First Name - JOHN, and edit also Second - or edit only one field.
[09:44:07] <JohnnyMcAffey> Press save. Check Console.
[09:44:09] <preference> i've edited all of them
[09:44:24] <Woet> JohnnyMcAffey: I edited 1 field, I get 1 console.log. I edit 2, I get 2, I edit 3, I get 3.
[09:44:25] <Woet> etc.
[09:44:44] <JohnnyMcAffey> It should have returned - ID: 1, NAME: John, Second: Macafee
[09:44:54] <Woet> JohnnyMcAffey: where is the code that's supposed to do that?
[09:44:59] <JohnnyMcAffey> but im heatting - ID:1 Name: John Second:Undefined
[09:45:04] <JohnnyMcAffey> ID:1 Name: Undefined
[09:45:07] <JohnnyMcAffey> Second: Macafee
[09:45:21] <JohnnyMcAffey> its on my localhost
[09:45:50] <preference> uh
[09:46:00] <preference> i think the problem here is that you've got two identical objects here, going by class
[09:46:08] <JohnnyMcAffey> ID: 1 Name: Test Second: undefined (index) ID: 1 Name: undefined Second: Field
[09:46:16] <preference> it's outputting both every time because you're referencing both
[09:46:45] <preference>     <input type="text" class="form-control secondInput" value="Second Name"> <---- this exists twice, so when you log form-control secondInput, it will print it twice
[09:49:54] <JohnnyMcAffey> can' t grasp this.
[09:50:17] <preference> ok, let me try and understand what you're trying to do
[09:50:31] <preference> you're trying to concatenate (join) the contents of the box called "first name" and the contents of the box called "second name"?
[09:51:00] <preference> so you type "john" and "macafee", the console shows "Name: John Second: Macafee"
[09:51:08] <preference> as in, name = john, second [name] = macafee
[09:51:11] <preference> is this correct?
[09:51:15] <JohnnyMcAffey> I'm trying to edit two fields, and pass them to POST - problem is, as it is not concating both fields, it sends POST data with one field missing - so if i post Name - A, Surname - B, it posts only one, because second field shows as UNDEFINDED
[09:51:22] <JohnnyMcAffey> Yes.
[09:51:33] <JohnnyMcAffey> But instead im getting two entries
[09:51:45] <JohnnyMcAffey> Name: John; Surname: undefined
[09:51:53] <JohnnyMcAffey> Name: Undefined; Surname; Macafee
[09:51:58] <preference> you're getting two entries because you're printing EVERY time a field changes
[09:52:12] <JohnnyMcAffey> ok, so i need to print it AFTER joining.
[09:52:16] <preference> if you just Name = John, it will only print 1 time
[09:52:28] <preference> if you  do Name = John and Second = Macafee, it will print for both Name and Second
[09:52:46] <JohnnyMcAffey> Yes, writing only JOHN, returs Name: John, Second: undefined
[09:53:01] <preference> because second IS undefined
[09:53:09] <JohnnyMcAffey> Should have - Name: John; Second: Data in field.
[09:53:16] <JohnnyMcAffey> It already contains value.
[09:53:16] <preference> the problem here is that you're not actually retrieving anything from any other fields
[09:53:19] <preference> no
[09:53:25] <JohnnyMcAffey> hmm...
[09:53:27] <preference>       var Name = $(this).closest('input.nameInput').val();       var Second = $(this).closest('input.secondInput').val();
[09:53:33] <preference> this is your issue
[09:54:02] <preference> what you want to say is "when either input.nameInput or input.secondInput is edited, check what's in the other one"
[09:54:30] <preference> let me see if i can do this for you, though please bear in mind i'm not an expert
[09:54:38] <JohnnyMcAffey> Thanks, good idea.
[09:54:46] <JohnnyMcAffey> Ok, im here. Im not expert either :)
[10:03:07] <preference> JohnnyMcAffey: this might be beyond me, actually -- i'll try a bit more but can't guarantee, sorry
[10:03:22] <JohnnyMcAffey> hmm... pretty simple, but hard :<
[10:03:45] <preference> i'm sure i'm just too bad at it haha
[10:03:52] <JohnnyMcAffey> haha...
[10:04:10] <preference> i think the issue is that you're going about it in an inefficient way
[10:05:21] <preference> Woet: any ideas on how to basically just concatenate two fields together if either of them have the class "edited"? doesn't seem like it should be hard
[10:09:35] <JohnnyMcAffey> Definitely - something wrong there.
[10:15:32] <preference> JohnnyMcAffey: think i'm getting somewhere
[10:16:07] <JohnnyMcAffey> :o
[10:25:28] <preference> JohnnyMcAffey: ok, i can't seem to reference the actual input contents for some reason (my syntax knowledge doesn't go that far), but this will at least print only one console
[10:25:36] <preference> i've also renamed the classes a bit
[10:25:48] <preference> https://jsfiddle.net/mqe2q2op/36/
[10:26:31] <JohnnyMcAffey> Now both returns undefined.
[10:26:34] <preference> yes
[10:26:39] <preference> but you just need to reference First and Second inputs
[10:26:46] <preference> the point is that it will at least now do it on one line
[10:27:05] <preference> the issue was that you were printing a line in the console for each class ending .edited.
[10:27:28] <preference> but now there will only be 1 class called .edited
[10:27:37] <JohnnyMcAffey> and also problem - when i edit only one field, yes it makes only one field.
[10:27:59] <JohnnyMcAffey> find edited fields in class .Pair?
[10:28:23] <preference> yes
[10:28:46] <preference> you should search from .pair and go downwards to find each child
[10:29:21] <preference> sorry i can't be of more assistance, i really am new here
[10:29:31] <preference> have to go now, o/
[10:57:21] <JohnMacafee> Sorry got disconnected.
[10:57:24] <JohnMacafee> Any ideas?
[10:57:37] <JohnMacafee> Someone in my work restarted computer, lol
[11:06:18] <JohnMacafee> @reference
[11:06:37] <JohnMacafee> I found a solution.
[11:06:46] <JohnMacafee> panel $.edited
[11:06:59] <JohnMacafee> panel.find(:input)
[11:07:03] <JohnMacafee> .val()
[11:07:03] <JohnMacafee> :)
[11:41:27] <JohnMacafee> why my script send three times POST data
[11:46:30] <Cork> JohnMacafee: do you have a jsfiddle of the call?
[11:52:03] <JohnMacafee> @Cork
[11:52:06] <JohnMacafee> making it :)
[11:52:23] <milyki> hey guys, what's the easiest method to display an image in full screen on click?
[11:52:34] <JohnMacafee> @Cork - https://jsfiddle.net/mqe2q2op/42/
[11:53:25] <JohnMacafee> @milyki - create a wrapper, with class invisible, then on click remove that class and load in picture.
[11:53:26] <Cork> milyki: add the image to the page with a class the puts position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; right: 0; bottom: 0; :)
[11:53:48] <JohnMacafee> Cork - check console - it's being sent 3x times
[11:53:59] <milyki> Cork, i forgot to mention an important part, there should also be a small X icon at the top right to close the image
[11:54:12] <milyki> should i simply append img into a div with that icon?
[11:54:14] <JohnMacafee> Cork - https://jsfiddle.net/mqe2q2op/44/
[11:54:32] <JohnMacafee> milyki - why not use some fancybox / lightbox?
[11:55:01] <Cork> milyki: have a look at fancybox
[11:55:01] <milyki> requirements specify jquery only (not even jquery ui)
[11:55:59] <Cork> JohnMacafee: why do you loop with a .map?
[11:56:14] <Cork> looks like you want a .each there
[11:58:19] <JohnMacafee> Cork! Really?
[11:58:19] <JohnMacafee> :D
[11:58:38] <Cork> JohnMacafee: you currently create a new array and fill it with undefined
[11:58:42] <JohnMacafee> I don't know - clearly i have lack of understanding of each functions :)
[11:58:46] <Cork> and then trow it away
[11:59:00] <Cork> so creating useless gc for each time you do this
[11:59:23] <Cork> JohnMacafee: .map() is for constructing a new jqeury set based on an old set
[11:59:34] <Cork> $.map is for creating an array
[11:59:48] <Cork> .each() is for just looping it, no collection at all
[11:59:56] <JohnMacafee> changed to .each(), still posts three times.
[12:00:03] <JohnMacafee> https://jsfiddle.net/mqe2q2op/50/
[12:00:25] <Cork> JohnMacafee: https://jsfiddle.net/mqe2q2op/51/
[12:00:30] <Cork> you have 3 .newStream
[12:00:38] <Cork> and you loop them and do a post for each
[12:00:40] <Cork> so 3 posts
[12:01:09] <Cork> i suspect you don't want the loops at all
[12:01:15] <JohnMacafee> Nop.
[12:01:49] <JohnMacafee> Wow! Thanks man :)
[12:01:59] <JohnMacafee> Such simple un-atention mistakes.
[12:02:34] <JohnMacafee> Right - for each of inputs it appended class newStream, thats why it was there for three times. Now i understand <3
[12:03:17] <JohnMacafee> Ok, now the next trick.
[12:03:29] <JohnMacafee> One field - all good.
[12:03:35] <JohnMacafee> Let's add two times.
[12:03:46] <JohnMacafee> It posts first entry on all fields :(
[12:04:33] <Cork> JohnMacafee: https://jsfiddle.net/mqe2q2op/54/
[12:04:50] <Cork> (didn't remove the .map so don't forget that)
[12:12:16] <JohnMacafee> Cork: removed - https://jsfiddle.net/mqe2q2op/58/
[13:50:29] <Tom2003> https://jsfiddle.net/bnzdnwb7/1/ I am trying to do this: a) click on a location link b) have the data-id of that location link be placed in the (normally) hidden input field. It's close, but not quite there
[15:13:05] <taplar> Tom2003: it looks like you are building the selector, but not using it
[15:15:00] <taplar> Also you are doing: jQuery(function($){})(jQuery)
[15:15:24] <taplar> you don't need the (jQuery) on the end.  You are executing the document ready already with the jQuery(function) part
[15:20:19] <Tom2003> should the selector be input#hidden_from or simply #hidden_from?
[15:20:47] <taplar> just the id
[15:21:25] <taplar> both will work, but an id only selector will short circuit to a lower level lookup method, rather than sizzle
[15:21:27] <Tom2003> so, hidden_from?
[15:21:36] <taplar> #hidden_from
[15:23:30] <Tom2003> I've updated it here https://jsfiddle.net/bnzdnwb7/13/ but the data-id value still doesn't show up in the hidden_from or hidden_to fields?
[15:23:46] <Tom2003> maybe https://jsfiddle.net/bnzdnwb7/14/
[15:24:11] <taplar> open your console.  you didn't fix the error I mentioned
[15:26:12] <Tom2003> I've now removed the jQuery at the end
[15:26:24] <taplar> and then your equality is missing the # on the front of it
[15:28:34] <Tom2003> not certain what you mean. On lines 34 and 37? https://jsfiddle.net/bnzdnwb7/20/
[15:28:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:28:56] <taplar> yep
[15:29:04] <robertmaxrees> why do you have both jQuery(function($) { and $(document).ready(function(){ ?
[15:29:10] <taplar> "#thing" == "thing" will never be true
[15:29:41] <taplar> woah, lol, missed that part
[15:29:54] <robertmaxrees> doc ready in a doc ready.
[15:30:31] <taplar> health anxieties
[15:32:41] <Tom2003> https://jsfiddle.net/bnzdnwb7/22/  extra document stuff removed from top.
[15:32:53] <Tom2003> The statement   if (hidden_lastFocused == "hidden_from"){   does equate to true
[15:33:02] <taplar> it shouldn't though
[15:33:09] <taplar> oh
[15:33:10] <taplar> lol
[15:33:15] <Tom2003> it's this line that is the issue: hidden_lastFocused.val($(this).data("id"));
[15:33:15] <taplar> you took the # off the top
[15:33:39] <taplar> ok, so now you just need to perform the lookup of the element and change it
[15:34:04] <taplar> hidden_lastFocused.val($(this).data("id"));
[15:34:12] <taplar> ^ a string without a # on the front of it
[15:37:07] <Tom2003> OK, so I've re-written line 20 and added #, and on line 34 I have also added a #.
[15:37:48] <taplar> is that the only two changes you made?
[15:37:55] <Tom2003> Line 34 still equates to true, but I get the following error message:  hidden_lastFocused.val is not a function
[15:38:01] <taplar> right
[15:38:01] <Tom2003> yes
[15:38:04] <taplar> what are you doing there?
[15:38:51] <Tom2003> I am trying to take the value of 'data-id' in the <li> tag, and place it in the hidden_from input
[15:39:02] <taplar> not what you are trying to do.  what -are- you doing?
[15:39:04] <taplar> line 36
[15:40:24] <Tom2003> I 'think' I am putting the data-id of the clicked link into #hidden_from
[15:40:38] <taplar> #hidden_from ?
[15:40:41] <taplar> what's that?
[15:41:06] <Tom2003> see line 5 <input type="text" id="hidden_from" name="from">
[15:41:08] <taplar> what kind of value is in hidden_lastFocused?
[15:41:50] <taplar> you should know, because you did something with it on line 34
[15:41:50] <Tom2003> If I click on 'Location a', the data-id = 3
[15:43:01] <Tom2003> hidden_lastFocussed should be '#hidden_from' or '#hidden_to'
[15:43:10] <taplar> and what kind of values are those?
[15:43:46] <Tom2003> text
[15:43:55] <taplar> ok.  so what are you doing on line 36?
[15:45:12] <Tom2003> I'm not sure. I am trying to write the equivalent of $('hidden_from').val($(this).data("id"));
[15:45:32] <Tom2003> sorry   $('#hidden_from').val($(this).data("id"));
[15:45:34] <taplar> so why not write that?
[15:45:38] <taplar> how does hidden_lastFocuesd relate to that command?
[15:46:13] <Tom2003> you make a very good point. One sec
[15:46:18] <taplar> heh
[15:46:28] <taplar> i like to poke until i hear a light bulb
[15:48:33] <Tom2003> ha. working: https://jsfiddle.net/bnzdnwb7/31/
[15:48:45] <Tom2003> felt like school again :)
[15:49:00] <taplar> so can you explain to me what the problem was?
[15:49:15] <taplar> that last part at least
[15:50:44] <Tom2003> What I was trying to do was build the selector using the variable that I had. But I still don't know why it wouldn't work when  lastFocused.val($(this).text())  does work
[15:51:14] <taplar> so what is lastFocused?
[15:51:31] <taplar> or more specifically, what does val() belong to?
[15:51:56] <Tom2003> My console says lastFocussed is: n.fn.init [input#trip_planner_form_from.highlight, context: input#trip_planner_form_from.highlight]
[15:52:04] <taplar> val() is a jQuery method
[15:52:13] <taplar> in order to use it, you must have a jQuery object to call it off of
[15:52:27] <Tom2003> so lastFocussed is an object
[15:52:38] <taplar> a jQuery object, $(this), yes
[15:52:48] <taplar> but hidden_lastFocused is ...
[15:53:01] <Tom2003> not an object, it is text
[15:53:14] <taplar> a String, yep.  A string containing a selector in fact
[15:54:12] <taplar> So you were trying to call val() off a string, which it's not defined for.  It's defined for jQuery objects.  Thus the error
[15:55:16] <Tom2003> how can I create the object? As far as I can tell, and object is a container for variables
[15:55:40] <taplar> $(selector|HTMLElement)
[15:56:10] <taplar> http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/selecting-elements/
[15:57:16] <taplar> lots of other good reading on that site as well
[16:07:39] <Tom2003> I'll use the code as it is, but now I am curious: How can I create an object using a name of my choice?  How can I make  $(hidden_lastFocussed).val($(this).data("id"));  be the same as $('hidden_from').val($(this).data("id"));
[16:09:29] <taplar> you just make the variable contain the same string
[16:09:41] <taplar> but that is invalid, because 'hidden_from' is not a valid selector.  It's missing the leading #
[16:10:47] <Tom2003> so, if hidden_lastFocussed = #hidden_from, then this should work: $(hidden_lastFocussed).val($(this).data("id"));
[16:11:08] <taplar> it should be syntactically correct
[16:11:25] <Tom2003> just checked it - it works!
[16:12:36] <Tom2003> That's what I after :)   https://jsfiddle.net/bnzdnwb7/36/
[16:12:57] <Tom2003> taplar, thank you ever so much for your patience! :)
[16:13:02] <taplar> yup, so now i have to nitpick a little
[16:13:02] <taplar> :D
[16:13:30] <taplar> could you not use a data attribute for the hidden_lastFocused ?
[16:15:01] <Tom2003> hadn't thought of that..
[16:15:10] <taplar> :)
[16:15:31] <taplar> rather than breaking up the id and all that logic.  a data-target or something could do the same thing, and be a little more transparent
[17:42:13] <eureka0584> how do I upgrade jquery?
[17:42:40] <robertmaxrees> how are you currently using it?
[17:42:50] <robertmaxrees> npm, cdn, etc.?
[17:43:34] <eureka0584> through a browser to access remote cameras
[17:45:10] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:45:25] <robertmaxrees> did you dowload it from a url, install it via NPM, or are you pointing to a cdn?
[17:45:29] <robertmaxrees> for jquery specifically.
[17:46:28] <taplar2> osmosis
[17:46:33] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:49:16] <eureka0584> url
[17:49:54] <RyansWorld> http://jquery.com/download/
[17:53:47] <eureka0584> I've tried downloading, but without success - Windows Script Host error:  'd' is null or not an object.  Code 800A138F.  Source: Microsoft JScript runtime error.
[17:55:04] <taplar> what is the url of the jquery include on the page?
[17:55:13] <Woet> eureka0584: show your test case.
[17:55:31] <Woet> looks more like a vbscript than webpage.
[17:57:18] <robertmaxrees> eureka0584 you don't double-click the file.
[17:57:49] <robertmaxrees> you have to link to the new version
[18:00:22] <eureka0584> How do I link my url to the new version of jquery?
[18:01:14] <taplar> is your application linking to a local copy of jquery or to a cdn?
[18:02:26] <RyansWorld> maybe you could put a snippet of the current code linking it?
[18:10:48] <eureka0584> Forgive me, I do not understand your question.  Very simply, I navigate to a particular IP address in order to view remote cameras at my store.  I am being advised to upgrade jquery related to this particular network port for security reasons.
[18:11:17] <taplar> For jquery to run on a webpage, it must be included on it.
[18:11:43] <taplar> In your source you should see something in the header related to a <script src="...address to jquery">
[18:11:53] <taplar> or possibly in the body, but some where that should exist
[18:14:11] <RyansWorld> Does HTML5 eliminate the need for the type="text/javascript" etc?
[18:14:24] <RyansWorld> in the <script tag
[18:14:41] <taplar> i usually leave it out.  i dunno if it's specifically a html5 change though
[18:18:15] <taplar> "Omitting the attribute, setting it to the empty string, or setting it to a JavaScript MIME type essence match, means that the script is a classic script, to be interpreted according to the JavaScript Script top-level production. Classic scripts are affected by the async and defer attributes, but only when the src attribute is set. Authors should o
[18:18:15] <taplar> mit the type attribute instead of redundantly setting it."
[18:18:34] <taplar> so maybe
[18:19:53] <eureka0584> here is what I find:  <script src="../script/LAB.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[18:20:16] <taplar> you don't see any other script tags on the page?
[18:22:00] <eureka0584> yes, this:  <script> 		$LAB 		.script("../script/global_config.js?version=" + new Date()).wait(function () { 			$LAB 			.script("../script/jquery-1.7.1.min.js").wait() 			.script("../script/jquery.cookie.js").wait() 			.script("../script/Translator.js?version=" + global_config.web_version).wait() 			.script("../script/common.js?version=" + global_config.web_version).wait() 			.script("../script/login.js?version=" + global_config.
[18:22:29] <taplar> $LAB.script("../script/jquery-1.7.1.min.js") <-- right there
[18:22:48] <taplar> so some where in your project you have a local copy of jquery, version 1.7.1
[18:23:21] <taplar> you'll need to update that copy, replacing it with whatever newer version you want, and then update your script to pull in that version rather than the 1.7.1 version
[18:32:18] <eureka0584> I am not a developer.  Is my internet service provider able to update jquery on my retail store's network?
[18:32:38] <taplar> This is something the site owners must do
[18:32:59] <taplar> Whoever owns and maintains the code base, it will be up to them
[18:35:53] <eureka0584> The IP address that I navigate to is actually an extension of my store's IP address.  Whom would you recommend that I reach out to for assistance?
[18:36:30] <taplar> Who maintains the software for your store?
[18:42:42] <eureka0584> What software do you mean?  My ISP assigned my local IP address years ago.
[18:43:28] <taplar> All the ISP is responsible for is the internet connection between your server and the world.
[18:43:42] <taplar> Someone put the software on your server for your store
[18:44:10] <taplar> Someone set your store up
[18:54:13] <eureka0584> I'll have to investigate further.  Thanks much for your input.  :)
[18:54:50] <taplar> sure thing
[22:52:40] <stanford_AI> how can I traverse two arrays for copying, in functional programming in javascript?
[22:57:13] <pavonia> Functional programming?
