[00:01:53] <duckgoose> I don't know if it's a good idea to have an attribute name with a dash in it
[00:02:17] <Cork> duckgoose: its common
[00:02:24] <Cork> actually it is by spec
[00:02:34] <Cork> data- is a html defined attribute prefix
[00:03:11] <Stiffler> so how to add quotes then?
[00:03:13] <Stiffler> I tried 			$chatWindow.data('user', ''+user+'');
[00:03:24] <Stiffler> but it doesnt have quotes
[00:04:03] <duckgoose> $chatWindow.data('user', '"'+user+'"');
[00:04:26] <duckgoose> $chatWindow.data('user', "\""+user+"\"");
[00:04:29] <duckgoose> etc etc etc
[00:04:35] <Cork> Stiffler: you can't select .data() values with selectors
[00:04:45] <Cork> and no you don't want quotes in the .data value
[00:05:12] <Cork> .data updates jquerys internal data cache, it doesn't touch the attributwe
[00:05:15] <Cork> *attribute
[00:05:36] <Stiffler> im trying to select by:  $('[data-user="stiffler.to@gmail.com"]')
[00:05:42] <Cork> Stiffler: so $chatWindow.data('user', user); is what you want
[00:05:46] <Cork> Stiffler: you can't
[00:06:18] <Stiffler> is it impossible to select element by its data attr value?
[00:06:26] <Cork> you have to do $('*').filter(function() { return $(this).data('user') == 'stiffler.to@gmail.com'; });
[00:06:35] <Cork> Stiffler: .data isn't attribute
[00:07:00] <Cork> Stiffler: if you want to force it to be an attribute you have to use .attr
[00:07:12] <Cork> Stiffler: that said, you might want to use a class for this instead
[00:07:26] <Cork> cause selecting based on an attribute on every element in the page is quite expensive
[00:07:27] <Stiffler> Cork: but @ character is not acceptable in class
[00:07:34] <Stiffler> but anyway your solution works
[00:07:35] <Cork> so replace it
[00:07:38] <Cork> or remove it
[00:07:39] <Stiffler> by filter
[00:08:06] <matthewbe_> hi
[00:08:21] <Cork> Stiffler: $chatWindow.attr('data-user', user); $('[data-user="stiffler.to@gmail.com"]') should also work
[00:08:29] <Cork> but rememver that .attr doesn't update .data
[00:08:47] <Stiffler> so which one solution is better?
[00:08:54] <Stiffler> by filter or by attr?
[00:09:13] <Cork> Stiffler: 1. use a class or something to narrow down the elements to just the ones that might be the target
[00:09:19] <Cork> Stiffler: after that i would go with .filter
[00:09:31] <matthewbe_> I have the following event on a checkbox: $("input#some-id").on("click", function() { /* code */ }. Question: when the page intiialises, I need to execute the code in the event if the checkbox is clicked. What's the ebst way to acheiev this? Should I trigger a click event? check if the
[00:09:41] <Cork> Stiffler: so something like $('.addresses').filter(function() { return $(this).data('user') == 'stiffler.to@gmail.com'; });
[00:10:06] <Cork> matthewbe_: 1. don't put element tags names infront of ids
[00:10:28] <Cork> ids are unique and the most effective selector you have, don't throw it away by first selecting all inputs in the page
[00:10:35] <Cork> 2. use .trigger('click')
[00:10:37] <Stiffler> ok thank you very much, Im going to follow your solution :)
[00:11:36] <matthewbe_> Cork, thank you!
[00:14:13] <matthewbe_> Cork, just tested, if I call .trigger("click"), then the checkbox changes its state.
[00:18:24] <Cork> uh
[00:19:43] <Cork> matthewbe_: so it is...
[00:19:52] <Cork> matthewbe_: then you have to use a named function can call it manually
[00:21:08] <matthewbe_> Cork, yes, I can externalize the code inside my event into some function, and execute this function when 1. the page initializes and 2. when the event is fired. I just wondered if that's the common way to do it.
[00:22:12] <Cork> matthewbe_: fake triggering the event switches form elements (had forgotten this) so ya, that is the way to go
[00:22:44] <matthewbe_> Cork, the other way would be to fire a "click" event, without changing the state (in this case of the checkbox), but probably there's no function to do that
[00:23:44] <Cork> matthewbe_: http://jsfiddle.net/fLdah459/
[00:24:11] <Cork> matthewbe_: correct there isn't
[00:24:24] <matthewbe_> Cork, wait... what's that?! https://api.jquery.com/triggerHandler/
[00:24:28] <Cork> you could invert the state and then fire it, though i think calling the function directly is cleaner
[00:25:01] <Cork> matthewbe_: you could try it, not sure if it works though
[00:26:08] <matthewbe_> Cork, it works, but don't know if I'm being lucky or if it's the correct soltuion lol
[00:27:31] <matthewbe_> Cork, "The .triggerHandler( "event" ) method will not call .event() on the element it is triggered on."
[00:28:06] <matthewbe_> Cork, does that mean in my case, that it won't change the state of the form elements, as there is no .event() claled (whatever that is)
[00:28:14] <matthewbe_> *called
[00:30:58] <Cork> matthewbe_: not sure, it might, try and see
[00:31:10] <matthewbe_> Cork, ok thx :)

[01:46:40] <kokut> Hello, i'm looking for a zoom on hover image plugin that won't make the container bigger, anyone knows something already done?
[02:15:42] <kokut> nvm found one
[02:16:54] <kokut> I have a div on top of another one, is there a way to trigger the hover event on the div below it?
[02:17:16] <kokut> hover/mouseenter/mouseleave/etc
[02:17:35] <Cork> kokut: by "below" do you mean a parent or just an element you've moved the other element above?
[02:18:12] <kokut> Cork: the element above it is a child of the other one that has been positioned as absolute
[02:18:18] <Cork> also is js events enough or do you need the browser native effects too?
[02:18:32] <Cork> kokut: that doesn't answer the question
[02:18:37] <kokut> Cork: i dont know
[02:18:43] <Cork> acutally, make a fiddle with what you have problem with
[02:29:21] <kokut> Cork: freaking jsfiddle man it broke and i cant type
[02:29:23] <kokut> but what i need is really simple
[02:29:41] <kokut> the div on top of the one i need to hover on is positioned absolute, thats all
[02:38:47] <kokut> Cork: you there?
[02:39:40] <Cork> kokut: you will have to make a demo, cause you haven't been able to explain the problem
[02:43:39] <kokut> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/40e3a3f4/3/
[02:43:41] <kokut> when the mouse enters the red zone it triggers the hover effect on it but when it goes to the green zone the hover effect is gone but i need to keep being on hover unless it exits the red zone
[02:44:02] <kokut> to the outside
[02:44:02] <kokut> not into the green zone
[02:44:02] <kokut> like green and red is all the same hover
[02:45:18] <Cork> and you're using js for hover?
[02:46:08] <Cork> if yes, https://jsfiddle.net/40e3a3f4/4/
[02:54:37] <disappeared> can someone tell me why a simple ajax request doesn’t work in ie9? http://jsfiddle.net/kh54zfw5/1/
[02:54:40] <kokut> Cork: i dont know why but its not working out on my website
[02:54:46] <disappeared> i’m doing something wrong obviously
[02:54:55] <kokut> yea i'm using jquery for hover
[02:54:59] <Cork> kokut: is the markup the same?
[02:55:13] <Cork> kokut: hover != mouseenter/leave
[02:55:38] <Cork> disappeared: you can't do cors ajax in ie<10
[02:56:33] <disappeared> Cork: OMG seriously? can i use a policy
[02:56:39] <Cork> sure
[02:57:31] <Uhkis> wow, blaming yourself instead of ie
[02:57:31] <kokut> oh nope
[02:57:31] <Uhkis> i bet disappeared is the first one ever to do that
[02:57:47] <disappeared> Uhkis: well i normally don’t do cross origin
[02:57:51] <disappeared> very rarely
[02:58:11] <Cork> ya, and it is still quite a good idea to avoid it
[02:58:14] <disappeared> on top of that i rarely test on ie9 cause i have to use a virtual machine hah
[02:58:22] <disappeared> Cork: i’m using a google api
[02:58:34] <Cork> disappeared: use there jsonp api
[02:58:34] <disappeared> i don’t know how to do a cross origin opolicy i’m googling
[02:58:42] <dziegler> disappeared: afaik u can use jsonp or you need to allow the origin in your HTML headers but i dont know if IE can handle this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing
[02:59:24] <Cork> disappeared: jsonp loads the data in normal javascript files, and it isn't limited to cors
[02:59:30] <Cork> so it works in ie<10 too
[03:00:00] <disappeared> Cork:  thank you sir doing it now
[03:00:26] <Cork> it means you execute code from the third party domain though
[03:00:46] <Cork> so you have to be confortable with giving them xss access to your site
[03:01:09] <Cork> (though the same goes for cdns)
[03:10:29] <disappeared> Cork: shit now i’m getting unexpected token.  on the result
[03:10:59] <Cork> disappeared: have you added the ?callback=? to the request?
[03:11:02] <kokut> Cork: i have a <div class="a"><a><img ...> and i need to select the image to apply the css, on mouseenter of .a, how can i do this?
[03:11:11] <disappeared> Cork: no
[03:11:18] <disappeared> but i thought it does it auatomcailly
[03:11:25] <Cork> no
[03:11:48] <disappeared> Cork: is there a snippet you can send me
[03:12:21] <kokut> Cork: i mean how can i select the image
[03:12:26] <disappeared> Cork: this is what i have https://gist.github.com/davidsalazar/9fdc8c5c5348d6b4b8dc
[03:12:50] <kokut> well, nvm i'm just gonna add a class to it
[03:13:08] <Cork> disappeared: just add ?callback=? to the end of the url
[03:13:16] <Cork> the rest should handle it self
[03:13:27] <disappeared> whats the second question mark for
[03:13:30] <disappeared> palceholder?
[03:13:48] <Cork> it asks jquery to endter the function name (randomly generated)
[03:14:05] <kokut> Cork: well as it is a hover effect i need to use $(this) otherwise i will have to make a function for every element
[03:14:06] <disappeared> Cork: nope that didn’t work
[03:14:37] <disappeared> i’l put it on a fiddle
[03:14:55] <kokut> is there a way to do something like $(this).children(a > img).on("mouseenter", function... etc?
[03:16:03] <disappeared> Cork: here is my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/kh54zfw5/4/
[03:16:04] <disappeared> it doesn’t work
[03:16:49] <disappeared> i’m looking at hte console
[03:16:57] <disappeared> i see it does add a callbackup func automatically
[03:18:33] <Cork> disappeared: that api isn't designed for client side use
[03:18:44] <disappeared> Cork: it says it is?
[03:18:52] <Cork> disappeared: its meant to be used aith an api key and it is meant to be kept private
[03:19:17] <disappeared> Cork: let me find link they actually recomedn it being client side
[03:19:22] <disappeared> since the quota is based on ip
[03:19:35] <Cork> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/business/webservices/#client_id
[03:19:51] <Cork> https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/#api_key
[03:20:07] <Cork> disappeared: that api doesn't provide a jsonp end point
[03:20:14] <Cork> so ya, you can't use jsonp there
[03:20:46] <kokut> $(this).children("a > img").addClass('transition'); isnt working :\
[03:21:34] <Cork> $(this).children("a > img") means "list the direct children where i am an a tag"
[03:21:50] <disappeared> Cork: ok well even if you’re right why is it failing?
[03:22:10] <Cork> disappeared: cause jsonp must be a javascript funcation call
[03:22:14] <Cork> and you're calling it on json
[03:22:24] <disappeared> hm
[03:22:25] <Cork> so the browser tries to execute the json response and fails
[03:22:27] <kokut> Cork: i need to apply the transition class to the img thats the children of the a thats the children of $(this)
[03:22:29] <disappeared> oh
[03:22:47] <Cork> kokut: then you want .find not .children

[03:23:20] <Cork> kokut: ^
[03:23:40] <kokut> yea i've seen that
[03:24:33] <kokut> Cork: the thing is it has to be of $(this) otherwise iwill have to write a function call for every element
[03:24:56] <kokut> it's 3 elements but still if there is a way of doing it in just one call
[03:25:21] <Cork> kokut: then you haven't read the rest of the selector section

[03:26:16] <kokut> please
[03:26:27] <Cork> no _I_ don't have time to write every line of code you need
[03:26:50] <Cork> you need to know the basics of how jquery works to be able to understand the answers

[03:36:58] <HarryMilnes> Hm, Well, I'm using this plugin for MVC and when it hits my controller all it says it is is an '[object object]', I've not really got any idea how to deal with it since I'm not sure what it actually contains when it hits my method :S
[03:37:06] <HarryMilnes> The documentation you linked didn't really help me
[03:38:19] <Cork> HarryMilnes: well that means you try to move the object through something that converts it to a string
[03:40:19] <HarryMilnes> wut
[03:40:21] <HarryMilnes> :P
[03:40:58] <Cork> js> print({ a:1 }.toString())
[03:41:01] <b-ot> Cork: [object Object]
[03:41:58] <HarryMilnes> But I'm not trying to convert it to a string
[03:42:10] <Cork> ya, but something is before you try to access it
[03:42:29] <Cork> for example you might try to send the object between processes (this would convert it to json
[03:42:32] <Cork> )
[03:42:41] <Cork> and File can't be converted to json
[03:44:02] <HarryMilnes> I see
[03:49:25] <HarryMilnes> No idea why but it seems to think it's an array of String
[03:52:12] <HarryMilnes> All I'm using is http://pastebin.com/cyJXzfXb to send the file as a parameter
[03:55:49] <HarryMilnes> Can someone point me in the right direction with this?
[03:59:31] <HarryMilnes> http://localhost:64295/Home/Upload?file=[object%20Object] literally no idea where [object object] comes from, Am I just a retard
[04:00:05] <Cork> HarryMilnes: line 53
[04:00:11] <Cork> your converting file to a string there
[04:00:23] <Cork> *you're
[04:00:58] <Cork> explicitly the '?file=' + file part
[04:01:31] <HarryMilnes> How am I supposed to pass the file as a parameter without converting to a string though?
[04:02:58] <Cork> HarryMilnes: i don't know what sendTo does
[04:03:36] <Cork> but if you want to use ajax you have to use FormData
[04:03:49] <Cork> you can't post it as params
[04:06:46] <HarryMilnes> All I wanna do is retrieve the filedata as a parameter, I don't understand why jQuery makes it so difficult
[04:07:05] <HarryMilnes> would probably help if the plugin had some useful Documentation
[04:08:56] <Cork> HarryMilnes: it isn't jquery
[04:09:24] <Cork> HarryMilnes: you can't convert a random binary data blob to an ascii string you can have in the url
[04:09:26] <Cork> it isn't possible
[04:10:09] <Cork> HarryMilnes: without knowing how "sendTo" works it looks like you want the file name and not the file in the url
[04:10:24] <HarryMilnes> https://github.com/ProgerXP/FileDrop/blob/master/filedrop.js
[04:10:32] <HarryMilnes> I just want the filedata so I can go ahead and upload the file
[04:14:33] <Cork> HarryMilnes: sendTo wants the target you want to send the file to
[04:15:01] <Cork> HarryMilnes: you need to have a script server side that receives the data and saves it to disk
[04:15:25] <Cork> ex. (from there doc) file.sendTo('upload.php', {method: 'PUT'})
[04:15:33] <HarryMilnes> Which is what I was going to do with a method in MVC with the parameter, but now I have no idea how I'm supposed to know where the files are if I can't use a parameter
[04:16:04] <Cork> HarryMilnes: no you ?file is an url parameter
[04:16:11] <Cork> it can't hold a full file
[04:16:18] <Cork> you have to use post or put
[04:16:20] <Cork> (or patch)
[04:16:28] <Cork> where the data is sent in the request body instead
[04:16:41] <Cork> (this has nothing to do with jquery, it is how http works)

[04:19:38] <kokut> Cork: have you tried jquery ui dialog?
[04:19:46] <Cork> kokut: dialog doesn't have any clickOutside option
[04:19:58] <kokut> oh lol
[04:20:02] <Cork> ...
[04:20:03] <kokut> how can i do it then? :\
[04:20:09] <Cork> kokut: you need to start to read...
[04:21:25] <kokut> Cork: right now i don't have much time for that, is there a way to know if the user is clicking outside the area of the dialog and bind it to close it?
[04:21:56] <Uhkis> you don't have time, but you assume we have time to fix your problem?
[04:22:00] * Cork puts kokut snuggly in the ignore list
[04:22:16] <kokut> Cork: don't do that man
[04:22:28] <kokut> if you ndont want to answer me just tell me but dont ignore me
[04:22:58] <kokut> Uhkis: lol if you know the answer you dont need to spend any time
[04:24:14] <Uhkis> ...
[04:25:14] <HarryMilnes> You said I couldn't send file in a parameter because it'll convert to a string, how else am I supposed to pass it as a paramter? :/
[04:25:38] <Cork> HarryMilnes: ... i said you can't
[04:26:18] <Cork> HarryMilnes: and url can be like 20000 chars or something like that (don't remember the limit in todays browsers) and it can't contain a lot of characters you will find in a binary file
[04:27:00] <Cork> HarryMilnes: so you have to post if as a post/put/patch where this data is in the http body instead
[04:27:18] <Cork> you _CAN'T_ send a file in the url
[04:27:21] <Cork> it isn't possible
[04:27:41] <kokut> cork Uhkis fixed it with http://codepen.io/agence-web-coheractio/pen/pEnoA :)
[04:28:08] <Cork> HarryMilnes: the plugin you use sets the file data, you just need to provide what verb to use and the end point
[04:28:31] <Cork> the plugin handles creating the ajax request with the file data
[04:38:37] <kokut> $("li[class*='classname'").last().css('...'); unrecognized expression :\
[04:39:18] <kokut> nvm fixed it

[04:53:56] <Cork> js> var b = 10; b = b || "the default"; print(b)
[04:53:59] <b-ot> Cork: 10
[04:54:52] <toomus> Cork: simple, nice and works :)
[05:12:58] <ANJ7> hey guys
[05:18:39] <Chulbul> type="submit" is working in firefox but not in chrome.
[05:19:29] <Chulbul> how to overcome such disaster !!
[05:21:13] <Cork> Chulbul: uh... context?
[05:21:19] <Cork> type="submit" on what?
[05:21:31] <Cork> and isn't working when you do what?
[05:21:38] <Chulbul> button form submit
[05:21:48] <Cork> ?demo @ Chulbul
[05:21:48] <b-ot> Chulbul: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[05:24:38] <Chulbul> code is full of crap .. custom.js 940 lines of code .. form is just simple form ..
[05:25:03] <Chulbul> console is showing me few errors: event.returnValue is deprecated. Please use the standard event.preventDefault() instead.
[05:25:03] <Cork> Chulbul: well then dig though the crap and find what causes it, cause submit isn't the cause
[05:25:11] <Chulbul> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'shift' of null
[05:25:17] <Cork> there you go
[05:25:29] <Chulbul> Consider using 'dppx' units instead of 'dpi', as in CSS 'dpi' means dots-per-CSS-inch, not dots-per-physical-inch, so does not correspond to the actual 'dpi' of a screen. In media query expression: (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 1.5), (min-resolution: 144dpi)
[05:25:53] <Chulbul> i don't understand where this shift is
[05:25:54] <Chulbul> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'shift' of null
[05:26:27] <Cork> it mans you ran .shift on a variable you expected to be something (most likely an array) but it was an undefined/null variable
[05:27:08] <Chulbul> I tried to search custom.js with shift keyword .. couldn't find it
[05:27:31] <Cork> well you will have a link to the line number in the error message
[05:27:47] <Chulbul> but here is somecode: if (c.shiftKey == true) { //some code here}
[05:28:42] <Chulbul> Cork, yes its from fb javascript sdk that is : e.src = document.location.protocol + '//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js';
[05:28:54] <Chulbul> all.js line 65
[05:29:51] <Chulbul> Cork, now what to do here .. its from fb?
[05:32:26] <Chulbul> I can provide you the link: http://www.hemaa.org/hemaa/organization/student/createcampaign/31

[05:34:04] <Chulbul> b-ot, I provided the url of my site
[05:35:20] <Chulbul> issue is in chrome
[05:38:42] <ANJ7> what should I do if I get this error? Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead.
[05:42:05] <Chulbul> I'm leaving today, will see you tomorow B-ot and
[05:42:08] <Chulbul> Cork
[05:42:21] <Chulbul> thanks :)
[05:54:58] <ANJ7> can anyone tell me why is my offset().top of a class undefined?
[06:11:31] <ANJ7> can you tell why my $(".navi").offset().top is giving undefined? 49.207.25.231
[06:13:40] <BillCriswell> ANJ7: I'm guessing .navi doesn't exist when you run it.
[06:14:20] <BillCriswell> Sure it's not giving you an error?
[06:14:22] <ANJ7> BillCriswell: thanks I figured it
[06:14:44] <ANJ7> BillCriswell: I used $(".navi").offset.top;
[06:14:50] <BillCriswell> Oh haha.
[06:14:59] <ANJ7> that gave me error.
[06:15:17] <DasLumberJackYa> good mourning key slayers
[06:15:18] <BillCriswell> So would the .offset().top on an element that doesn't exist.
[06:15:52] <BillCriswell> DasLumberJackYa: Good morning.
[06:16:12] <Sal> hi
[06:16:19] <BillCriswell> Ayyy
[06:16:23] <DasLumberJackYa> Aye
[06:16:47] <DasLumberJackYa> time to clone some forms
[06:16:54] <Sal> (function($){    is this a declaration of a dump function that gest initialized on document.ready?
[06:17:05] <Sal> gest=gets
[06:17:22] <DasLumberJackYa> not in global scope
[06:17:31] <DasLumberJackYa> execute immediately
[06:17:35] <BillCriswell> Sal: Looks liek the start of an IIFE
[06:17:58] <DasLumberJackYa> pass in jquery object
[06:18:03] <BillCriswell> Sal: Does it end with })(jQuery); or }(jQuery)); ?
[06:18:04] <Sal> BillCriswell, eds with    })(window.Zepto || window.jQuery);
[06:18:32] <toomus> Is it possible to calculate width of set of elements but also with margins?
[06:18:33] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.. so you that's just a IIFE.
[06:18:44] <Sal> whats that?
[06:18:46] <BillCriswell> toomus: outerWidth(true);
[06:19:13] <BillCriswell> Sal: It's just a way to use $ as jQuery safely in most cases involving jQuery.
[06:19:38] <BillCriswell> toomus: so that true flag just includes the margins.
[06:19:47] <Sal> ok, i'm using jquery, can i change it wth some more readable jquery syntax?
[06:21:11] <BillCriswell> Sal: You might not need that wrapper at all.. but it really depends on what else you have going on in your code.
[06:21:20] <Sal> BillCriswell, the dirst line is      $.gNews = function(obj) {
[06:21:44] <Sal> and the rest of the code is all inside this declaration
[06:22:21] <Sal> what does that do? does it declare a var as a function? why the dot ?
[06:23:08] <Cork> Sal: if adds a property to the $ object and the value of the property is the function
[06:23:27] <Cork> so gNews is the property name and function(obj) {} is the value
[06:23:45] <Sal> so the dot is simply part of the syntax?
[06:23:46] <Cork> Sal: another way to write the same thing is $['gNews'] = function(obj) {}
[06:23:51] <Sal> or part of the function name?
[06:23:54] <Cork> yes
[06:23:56] <Cork> well no
[06:24:05] <Cork> the function doesn't have a name
[06:24:13] <Cork> function() <--
[06:24:34] <Sal> oj, so its only a way to include a bunch of code inside $ ?
[06:24:37] <Cork> it is the name of the property that gets created inside the object pointing to the function
[06:24:46] <Cork> kinda
[06:25:07] <Sal> ok, and igf i want to call a function inside this "property" ?
[06:25:14] <Sal> lets say a foo() {} func
[06:25:15] <Cork> var $ = { gNews: function() { return true; } }; $.gNews()
[06:25:26] <Cork> js> var $ = { gNews: function() { return true; } }; print($.gNews())
[06:25:30] <b-ot> Cork: true
[06:25:44] <Cork> js> var $ = {}; $.gNews = function() { return true; }; print($.gNews())
[06:25:48] <b-ot> Cork: true
[06:25:54] <Sal> but inside gNews there are a lot of functions
[06:25:55] <Cork> js> var $ = {}; $['gNews'] = function() { return true; }; print($.gNews())
[06:25:58] <b-ot> Cork: true
[06:26:23] <Cork> Sal: those are just functions local to the scope crated by that function (there names isn't accessable outside)
[06:26:31] <Cork> *created
[06:26:52] <Sal> so the property must have a global (local) function that starts when i call the property?
[06:27:46] <Cork> well the function is the value of the property, it isn't exactly global
[06:27:53] <Cork> its scope is $
[06:28:12] <Sal> getting crazu on it
[06:28:23] <Sal> still canìt figure out its picture in my mind
[06:28:27] <Cork> Sal: another way to explain what it is, that might clear it up a bit
[06:28:52] <Cork> function theFunc() { return true; } var $ = { gNews: theFunc }
[06:29:08] <Sal> please talk in "clean" c/c++ style syntax. js is so messy
[06:29:12] <Cork> with one big difference; here the function is named, and is accessable directly
[06:29:26] <Cork> Sal: c/c++ doesn't have inline functions so it isn't possible
[06:29:43] <Cork> you would have to look at rust/go for compilated programs
[06:29:56] <Cork> or php python for scripts
[06:30:14] <Sal> inline functions are just normal function with a call to a named function
[06:30:22] <Sal> thats why js is messy
[06:30:23] <Sal> :)
[06:30:41] <Sal> with=without
[06:30:42] <Sal> sorry
[06:30:43] <Cork> Sal: js can pass functions by reference
[06:30:56] <Cork> this is the main difference here
[06:31:00] <Sal> a pointer to a func
[06:31:13] <Sal> a long life language did that before
[06:31:14] <Sal> hehehe
[06:31:15] <Cork> kinda, but it also inherits scope
[06:31:20] <Omar-> whats the best way to loop through an array to find a text?
[06:31:26] <Cork> so it can access variables not local to the one calling it later
[06:31:35] <Sal> anyway, i'm got it now
[06:31:35] <Cork> Omar-: $.each
[06:31:48] <Sal> thanks for your help
[06:32:02] <Cork> Omar-: depends on what you want to do with the target when you find it though
[06:37:13] <toomus> BillCriswell: thx
[06:38:20] <BillCriswell> toomus: No problem.
[06:38:58] <BillCriswell> toomus: I wasn't sure if you wanted help with adding it all up so I didn't mention that either haha
[06:44:49] <Omar-> Cork i'm doing a test, i'll post it in a min
[06:51:57] <Omar-> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/tLgy59xu/ not working as it should
[06:52:35] <Omar-> code begins at line 368
[06:54:13] <Cork> Omar-: well the content is added to the dom
[06:54:26] <Cork> the problem (i guess) is with the listview("refresh")
[06:55:04] <Cork> ah, no you intentionally hide them
[06:55:24] <Omar-> yeah, I append them and then hide them
[06:56:05] <Cork> ah, now i see
[06:56:15] <Cork> Omar-: you need to add back the hide on each input
[06:56:35] <Omar-> i dont understand
[06:56:56] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/tLgy59xu/2/
[06:57:18] <Cork> you also need to update the filter to it doesn't match everything if text == ""
[06:58:48] <Omar-> Cork true, thanks!
[06:59:19] <Omar-> is there a way to make it search multiple phrases, e.g. "910 west"
[06:59:36] <Cork> you mean match each word?
[07:02:25] <Omar-> Cork yes
[07:02:42] <Omar-> update it http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/tLgy59xu/
[07:02:46] <Cork> then you would have to split the text on space
[07:02:47] <Omar-> but without matching
[07:02:59] <Cork> and loop the array in each filter iteration
[07:03:07] <Omar-> hmmmm sounds like too much code
[07:03:15] <Cork> na
[07:03:46] <Omar-> if (e.which == "space bar") words.push(val) etc?
[07:03:50] <Omar-> something like this?
[07:08:50] <Cork> Omar-: something like this should work http://jsfiddle.net/tLgy59xu/4/
[07:09:45] <Omar-> Cork wonderful!
[07:09:57] <Omar-> many thanks!
[07:13:52] <Omar-> Cork to highlight text within an input, this.select()?
[07:16:53] <fred1807> Can I make a plain html link call a shell command on the server?
[07:18:09] <Dr-007> fred1807; no
[07:20:17] <Uhkis> if the link points to a serverside script that executes the command
[07:22:50] <DasLumberJackYa> any one here use jquery cloneya?
[07:24:25] <BillCriswell> DasLumberJackYa: Yes.
[07:25:17] <BillCriswell> If I just need the HTML I tend to just do like var clone = $('.foo').prop('outerHTML'); though.
[07:25:47] <DasLumberJackYa> BillCriswell: Ill throwup a jsfiddle, but my buttons have no events attached and do nothing... I delcared them in the instaiation object though
[07:25:50] <BillCriswell> When I need data and events and all that jazz I use clone (which is rare nowadays)
[07:25:55] <Cork> Omar-: no, highlighting will me a lot harder than that
[07:26:06] <Cork> Omar-: you have to insert extra elements in the element
[07:26:16] <Cork> like span or <b> or <i>
[07:26:47] <Omar-> Cork I'll try this
[07:27:08] <Omar-> btw, I want elements to be hidden initially.
[07:27:15] <Omar-> I will try to fix it
[07:27:23] <Omar-> if I get stuck, I'll let you know
[07:34:49] <DasLumberJackYa> BillCriswell: rails dev mode makes it damn near impossible to make a jas fiddle in a reasonable amount of time....
[07:35:03] <BillCriswell> DasLumberJackYa: haha never used it.
[07:35:11] <BillCriswell> or rails for that matter.
[07:35:43] <DasLumberJackYa> ever resource is broken apart and the html is escaped
[07:37:05] <DasLumberJackYa> BillCriswell: http://pastie.org/10107528 this is my cloneya declaration... see anything wrong?
[07:37:37] <BillCriswell> Oh, I thought you were just typing clone weird lol
[07:37:39] <DasLumberJackYa> the clone button and delete button hav eno events attached and do nothing
[07:38:07] <DasLumberJackYa> no this i a library that increments ids and does other htings
[07:43:05] <BillCriswell> I'm not familiar with cloneya, but the syntax looks fine.
[07:51:33] <DasLumberJackYa> k
[08:10:05] <ToTheInternet> I would like to build a GUI with jqueryUI similar to this example: http://jqueryui.com/resources/demos/draggable/sortable.html Except I want to be able to put more than 1 item in a row, i.e. next to each other. Also, i want to allow empty rows. Can this be achieved with jqueryUI?
[08:14:31] <BillCriswell> ToTheInternet: You can float them if I'm understand what you want right..
[08:14:44] <BillCriswell> Wait maybe not.
[08:19:24] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/qofapi/1/edit?html,js,output so from here what do you need?
[08:20:09] <BillCriswell> do you essentially want like.. placeholders for all the spots and allow empty ones?
[08:20:17] <BillCriswell> ToTheInternet: ^^
[08:23:12] <DeoSama> If I have a countdown on my browser, how can I detect when it reaches a certain number?
[08:24:36] <ToTheInternet> BillCriswell: sorry i didn't see your response right away. i want to allow empty spots, yes. i also want more than 1 item in a spot
[08:24:51] <BillCriswell> ToTheInternet: Ahh..
[08:25:00] <ToTheInternet> or more than one spot in a row, if you will
[08:25:48] <BillCriswell> so you have a set number of places to put X items?
[08:27:27] <jimmystewart> im trying to make this slider jquery plugin i have responsive.   its a 3 year old plug-in, and all  of its img widths are in pixels. im assuming im going to need to make them in percentages... i dont know if it will be possible doing this with this plug-in, easily. if someone could take a look at the  plug-in jquery preview id really appreciate it
[08:27:29] <jimmystewart> http://pastebin.com/vrf7yHvG
[08:27:51] <ToTheInternet> BillCriswell: i don't know the number of items before hand. but i want infinite spaces. if i have X items, i want to be able to put all of them next to each other in row 3
[08:28:23] <jimmystewart> in looking at that preview.js   the img widths are all in pixels, is there a way to tell the plug-in use percentages not pixels? is that the proper way to go about this?
[08:28:23] <ToTheInternet> BillCriswell: or all of them in row one, etc. the only thing that is fixed though, is the number of rows!
[08:29:02] <BillCriswell> ok, so the "rows" will be droppable areas?
[08:29:17] <ToTheInternet> BillCriswell: yes :)
[08:31:40] <BillCriswell> and if they go in a row they're just lining up side by side? you don't have cells or anything like that?
[08:32:21] <ToTheInternet> BillCriswell: i haven't decided. but i guess i can't do cells because in that case i would have to specify the amount of cells i want
[08:33:09] <ToTheInternet> BillCriswell: in the end i want a single data structure that holds all the information of the current state, i.e. which item resides in which row
[08:33:40] <BillCriswell> hmmm
[08:34:22] <ToTheInternet> BillCriswell: so the order of the items inside a single row is not important (although it will be represented in the gui, but i don't need this information in the data structure)
[08:34:56] <BillCriswell> I think each row would need to be a sortable with connectWith set properly
[08:38:56] <ToTheInternet> BillCriswell: sounds good. i found this example: http://www.pureexample.com/jquery-ui/sortable-connectwith.html not quite what i want but closer than the previous example
[08:40:27] <BillCriswell> ToTheInternet: http://jsbin.com/qofapi/3/edit?html,css,js,output quick hack but should get you kind of close.. the only thing is you'll need need to loop through .row I guess to figure out where certain items are?
[08:41:06] <BillCriswell> Oops: http://jsbin.com/qofapi/4/edit?html,css,js,output
[08:41:58] <BillCriswell> Actually still overcomplicating it haha
[08:42:01] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/qofapi/5/edit?html,css,js,output is enough.
[08:42:37] <BillCriswell> ToTheInternet: ^^
[08:43:00] <ToTheInternet> BillCriswell: this is awesome :) thank you so much
[08:43:11] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:43:30] <BillCriswell> That actually worked out a lot better than I thought.. never used sortable
[08:43:33] <ToTheInternet> way easier than i thought, you really helped me there :)
[08:43:44] <BillCriswell> Glad I could help.
[09:00:52] <BillCriswell> ToTheInternet: I beefed it up a bit cause I have something similar I need this for. http://jsbin.com/qofapi/6/edit?html,js,output
[09:01:47] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/qofapi/7/edit *
[09:06:45] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/qofapi/8/edit forgot something
[09:06:52] <BillCriswell> ok food time.
[09:18:42] <Sal> hi does anyone here use pgwModal ?
[09:20:13] <robertmaxrees> Sal if you have a question, just ask it.
[09:20:19] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will.
[09:20:33] <Sal> i'm looking for a responsive modal dialog
[09:21:06] <Sal> not only for alert or confirms, but also for displaying long data inside table
[09:21:31] <Sal> can't find any that keep the background freezed while showing and scrolling
[09:21:41] <robertmaxrees> while scrolling their contents, you mean?
[09:21:47] <Sal> yes
[09:21:59] <robertmaxrees> use something like jqmodal and set it up yourself. that's what i'd do.
[09:22:01] <Sal> pgwModal does the right things
[09:22:19] <Sal> but trying it, i found out that it doesn't close like it should
[09:22:27] <robertmaxrees> how so?
[09:22:31] <Sal> same sample on author wevsite, works
[09:22:40] <Sal> have no idea
[09:22:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:22:52] <Sal> i just added the .css and .js
[09:22:59] <robertmaxrees> you're saying it doesn't close like it should, but you don't know how?
[09:23:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:23:07] <Sal> wrote the same first sample
[09:23:15] <Sal> and mine doesn't close
[09:23:18] <amikrop> What is the simplest way to pass custom event data on an event handler? How will the event handler look like then?
[09:23:35] <robertmaxrees> amikrop http://api.jquery.com/on/ talks about how to do it.
[09:23:45] <amikrop> thanks
[09:23:48] <robertmaxrees> Sal any console errors?  can you share an example?
[09:23:54] <Sal> no
[09:24:14] <Sal> i debuged it, and saw that it just closes and reopens quickly
[09:24:20] <Sal> thats why it seems to not close
[09:24:36] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Sal
[09:24:36] <b-ot> Sal: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:24:52] <Sal> i'll try
[09:25:07] <robertmaxrees> otherwise i'm playing guessing games.
[09:25:24] <amikrop> robertmaxrees: I can pass event data to any event directly, or only using .on or .trigger?
[09:25:34] <robertmaxrees> amikrop huh?
[09:25:40] <robertmaxrees> mind explaining what you're trying to do?
[09:25:59] <amikrop> eg can I do $('foo').change({a: 'b'}, function () {});
[09:26:37] <robertmaxrees> i prefer to use .on() for all bindings, but if you check out the docs for .change(), you'll see you can do that,.
[09:26:50] <amikrop> ok thx
[09:27:27] <robertmaxrees> Sal you need to make a small, self-contained example.
[09:27:44] <robertmaxrees> it shouldn't require seeing your entire site.
[09:28:03] <dan_j> Hi. I'm struggling with chosen:updated. When its on my site, it doesn't update the contents of the chosen list. But in Jsbin, it works fine.
[09:28:09] <dan_j> This is the working copy http://jsbin.com/yuzetiyuru/3/
[09:28:19] <dan_j> This is the not working copy. http://betaweb.keshercommunications.com/internationalnumbers.asp
[09:28:19] <Sal> the problem is that now i have some eye problems, and that damn white background of jsfiddle, it blinfing me
[09:28:29] <dan_j> Any ideas what the cause could be?
[09:28:45] <Sal> but i'll do it, fimme some time please
[09:28:51] <Sal> gimme
[09:28:55] <dan_j> The JS is at the bottom of that page. Around like 600.
[09:29:03] <dan_j> line*
[09:29:09] <robertmaxrees> dan_s any console errors?
[09:29:13] <robertmaxrees> also,  <button onclick="javascript:additems();">Click Me</button> is bad
[09:29:26] <dan_j> I know. I just put that in for the test.
[09:29:47] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:29:53] <dan_j> No console errors on the real page apart from a 404 error of an unrelated graphic
[09:30:24] <dan_j> onclick is only on the jsbin sample to check that chosen was working
[09:30:50] <dan_j> on the real one, i have another chosen box which runs the update code when there is a change.
[09:31:04] <robertmaxrees> so this isn't indicative of the broken version.
[09:31:34] <dan_j> I suppose I need to add a 2nd chosen box to try to simulate it exactly.
[09:31:47] <robertmaxrees> if we can't see it broken, it's hard for us to help :0
[09:34:52] <dan_j> Ok. I've updated jsbin and now it's broken
[09:34:53] <dan_j> http://jsbin.com/yuzetiyuru/3/
[09:35:24] <dan_j> Choose an item from the first, and it should update the second. When i check the html, the select box does get updated, but chosen doesnt seem to update.
[09:37:10] <robertmaxrees> let's take a poke.
[09:38:46] <robertmaxrees> it's broken on jsbin because url: "/ajax/internationalnumbersajax.asp", will never resolve.
[09:39:43] <robertmaxrees> can you share an example of the data?
[09:42:02] <Sal> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/jsfktrhv/
[09:42:10] <Sal> this is it, but its not even opening here
[09:42:15] <Sal> let me look better
[09:42:28] <robertmaxrees> link the pgwmodal assets using "external resources" on the left.
[09:42:28] <Sal> maybe i made a mistake in the last js lines i wrote
[09:42:42] <Sal> i don't know where they are
[09:43:04] <robertmaxrees> look on the left hand side.
[09:43:08] <Sal> i don't think they use cdn
[09:43:08] <robertmaxrees> see where it says "external resources"?
[09:43:15] <Sal> yes
[09:43:20] <robertmaxrees> you can link using that.
[09:43:29] <Sal> but i don't know the cdn
[09:43:37] <robertmaxrees> if they only have versiopns on github, you can use https://rawgit.com/ to general a URL to use.
[09:44:08] <robertmaxrees> just navigate to the file you want to have hosted, paste in in the big input, and nab one of the urls it spits back out.
[09:44:28] <dan_j> Ah. Forgot to update that when i moved it to jsbin. Will fix. 1secm
[09:45:54] <dan_j> robertmaxrees: I've fixed the ajax call.
[09:46:02] <robertmaxrees> linky to the bin?
[09:46:11] <dan_j> http://jsbin.com/yuzetiyuru/3/

[09:50:35] <NoiseEee> you need to include the library

[09:50:52] <Sal> i did

[09:56:42] <DasLumberJackYa> cloning forms is a pain in the arse
[09:57:29] <pyCasso> Is it possible to pass args to a function without it being in a set order?
[09:57:29] <Sal> ok, i have jquery version 2.1.3 and have it at the end of the body
[09:57:37] <Sal> but still not working here
[09:57:38] <Sal> damn
[09:57:55] <pyCasso> Sal: whats the error message say/
[09:58:01] <Sal> no error
[09:58:07] <BillCriswell> pyCasso: You can pass an object as options.
[09:58:15] <Sal> in denugging, i saw that it closes and then reopens
[09:58:54] <Sal> debugging, sorry
[09:59:13] <pyCasso> BillCriswell: like this? https://bpaste.net/show/21a4fa4c35b4
[09:59:17] <BillCriswell> DasLumberJackYa: So you're trying to clone a form and do what?
[10:00:10] <BillCriswell> pyCasso: No.
[10:00:42] <DasLumberJackYa> I have a form that is for data, so its large, I have to have a button to basically copy all the fields with their events, and values while incrementing each id and name as to be compatible with rails
[10:01:50] <pyCasso> BillCriswell: like this? perhaps https://bpaste.net/show/8432b48fff4d
[10:01:55] <BillCriswell> You would do like...  function buildWrap (options) { }; then in there do like var defaults = { label_id: 'tribute-section', ... }; then you can do an extend on the defaults with the settings passed in mby the user.
[10:02:07] <BillCriswell> pyCasso: Yes.
[10:02:30] <Sal> damn! i found it
[10:02:34] <Sal> fck!
[10:02:53] <Sal> instead of    $(document).on('click', '.m-actFormLookupAdd', function(e) {
[10:03:06] <Sal> i was doinf    $(document).on('click', $('.m-actFormLookupAdd'), function(e) {

[10:04:28] <NoiseEee> Sal: word, good on finding the issue!
[10:05:04] <Sal> thanks again guys
[10:05:13] <dan_j> robertmaxrees: Yes, it's failing now. Any idea why?
[10:05:24] <dan_j> robertmaxrees: maybe you can't have two chosens on one page?
[10:05:47] <robertmaxrees> dan_j the ajax is failing.
[10:05:50] <robertmaxrees> not chosen.
[10:06:21] <dan_j> Hmm. 1sec
[10:08:27] <pyCasso> BillCriswell: why $.extend( {}, defau, opts ) ??
[10:08:31] <dan_j> I dont know why it was failing. its not failing now.
[10:08:34] <dan_j> http://jsbin.com/yuzetiyuru/3/
[10:08:53] <BillCriswell> pyCasso: So you don't have to pass every setting.
[10:09:15] <BillCriswell> It seemed to me like you basically wanted default arguments.
[10:09:26] <dan_j> robertmaxrees: here is an example for the ajax response. http://pastebin.com/Y4b5j35d
[10:09:35] <robertmaxrees> dan_j it's stil failing - http://jsbin.com/vaseqiwoyu/1/edit
[10:09:36] <dan_j> Firefox gives me that
[10:09:42] <robertmaxrees> you removed the fail callback.
[10:09:59] <pyCasso> Yeah, spent 2 hours trying to fix a bug. thanks BillCriswell
[10:10:19] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[10:10:28] <robertmaxrees> dan_j the response is empty when posting to it.
[10:11:00] <dan_j> robertmaxrees: when i run my jsbin, it doesnt report a failure
[10:11:16] <robertmaxrees> dan_j do you have the fail callback in yours?
[10:11:33] <dan_j> No. The code is identical now.
[10:11:36] <robertmaxrees> check the network tab and look at the response - it's empty.
[10:12:38] <dan_j> My network tab shows 200 response from the ajax call, and the console shows the data
[10:12:47] <dan_j> ...in firefox
[10:12:51] <robertmaxrees> i'm in firefox, too.
[10:13:02] <robertmaxrees> not sure what else to tell you at this point, then.
[10:13:17] <robertmaxrees> it's failing for me /shrug
[10:13:20] <dan_j> Ah, just seen this when using jsbin
[10:13:21] <dan_j> Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at http://betaweb.keshercommunications.com/ajax/internationalnumbersajax.asp. This can be fixed by moving the resource to the same domain or enabling CORS.
[10:13:55] <robertmaxrees> right.
[10:16:46] <dan_j> Ok, now i've enabled CORS, its working on jsbin
[10:17:06] <dan_j> but not on the website itself. I wonder if there is another script affecting things.
[10:36:23] <cjohnson> what error are you getting on the site
[10:42:34] <dan_j> No errors.
[10:42:50] <dan_j> It's ok. I've removed some js which wasn't needed and its working now.
[10:43:37] <dan_j> There was js related to a revolution slider that had been removed. Not sure why that would be preventing chosen from updating
[11:13:40] <VaibhavRajput> I am using angular-drapdrop for draggable and droppable of jqueyrui, I wanted to validate that the user can only drop selected items. For this I wanted to read/check draggable and droppable elements. May I know How to do this?
[11:15:36] <arthurvr> hey VaibhavRajput
[11:17:21] <BillCriswell> VaibhavRajput: There's an `accept` option for droppables. There's also an undocumented argument if you use a function for the `revert` callback on the draggable itself.
[11:17:22] <VaibhavRajput> arthurvr, Yes Sir.
[11:18:27] <arthurvr> VaibhavRajput: sorry we needed to redirect you to here. This is the place to be, not the dev channels :)
[11:19:20] <VaibhavRajput> arthurvr, :)
[11:20:48] <VaibhavRajput> BillCriswell, accept won't help as need both elemnt (drop and drag) to be check.
[11:21:45] <BillCriswell> VaibhavRajput: You can do that in the draggables revert option if you use a function, but it's not documented so not sure how cool it is to use.
[11:26:19] <BillCriswell> VaibhavRajput: http://jsbin.com/lugere/1/edit?html,js,output
[11:27:58] <VaibhavRajput> BillCriswell, Yes. I have also found something similar http://jamesallardice.com/run-a-callback-function-when-a-jquery-ui-draggable-widget-reverts/
[11:28:58] <BillCriswell> Well there ya go.
[11:29:12] <BillCriswell> How's things arthurvr?
[11:29:23] <arthurvr> all fine BillCriswell
[11:29:30] <arthurvr> quite busy doing open source these days
[11:29:38] <arthurvr> need to spend more time hanging out in here
[11:30:25] <BillCriswell> it's a tough balance i am sure haha
[11:31:30] <BillCriswell> especially with how comitted you are
[11:32:01] <arthurvr> haha thanks BillCriswell. But it’s that nice over here, just feel like I should spend more time hanging out in nice IRC places
[11:32:08] <arthurvr> how are you BillCriswell ?
[11:52:57] <BillCriswell> i'm good, just looking through web design gallery things arthurvr.
[11:54:25] <DeltaHeavy> I have a bunch of modules in seperate files. Many of these modules have a throttled resize event on window. This results in several event listeners attatched on window (throttled) resize. I'm wondering if this has a fairly big impact on preformance and if so how can I mitigate it?
[11:54:49] <robertmaxrees> DeltaHeavy it can - are you noticing performance issues?
[11:55:06] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: No but both of my computers are i7's with GPUs
[11:55:29] <DeltaHeavy> It's quite a massive site and it's likley to get better wtih more of these events.
[11:55:32] <robertmaxrees> are you properly storing the window selector, minimizing calculations, etc?
[11:55:51] <robertmaxrees> ideally, you should have one listener registered.
[11:55:59] <robertmaxrees> but the listener on its own isn't going to cause your headaches.
[11:56:24] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: I'm not referencing the window selector inside the event itself. How would I go about that? But yeah I'm making all other possible optimizations I can see.
[11:56:56] <DeltaHeavy> Ok, so haveing a bunch of listeners is fine? It's more about what's going on inside of them?
[11:57:09] <robertmaxrees> "a bunch of listeners" is ephemeral.
[11:57:11] <robertmaxrees> how many?
[11:57:14] <DeltaHeavy> Cause I thought since it's on resize just the fact that they have to simply fire a lot causes issue.
[11:57:25] <DeltaHeavy> Right now like 4 but I can see quite a few more in the future.
[11:57:33] <robertmaxrees> nip that in the bud then.
[11:58:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd register some kind of setup where you register all your handlers into an array or something, and then have a single listener that executes those, instead.
[11:58:25] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Do you know of any possible solutions? I'm thinking of just having the events as functions and putting a single event listening in my initialization file that calls each of those functions.
[11:58:35] <DeltaHeavy> Ok I see
[11:58:40] <DeltaHeavy> That sounds good
[11:58:46] <robertmaxrees> there are a few different ways to do it.
[11:58:56] <robertmaxrees> just avoid things like running selectors inside the handlers.
[11:58:58] <weoob> I'm having an inconsistency. When I call $('#element').toggle(100, callback) with one of my apps, the element swoops in from the left. on the other app it appears as if the height is animated from 0 to 100%. Why does toggle do different things here?
[11:59:00] <robertmaxrees> keep things minimal.
[11:59:20] <weoob> both run jquery 1.11.3
[11:59:31] <forQuery> css question not a jquery question but.. #css ppl are idiots.  When I hover an element, it paints that element.  When I scroll and then hover the same element, it paints the entire page.  Anyone ever seen this wtf type behavior before?
[11:59:54] <robertmaxrees> forQuery they're not idiots - no need to be like that.
[12:03:02] <forQuery> hehe, i wish i could cut and paste their responses
[12:03:08] <forQuery> then you'd probably understand better
[12:03:15] <forQuery> but, it'd bee too much content
[12:03:28] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Yeah, this is a rather beastly framework we're making here though.
[12:04:09] <DeltaHeavy> Another question. I'm using jshint and I'm enforcing camel case. Is there a preferred way to have it accept constants in all caps?
[12:04:27] <robertmaxrees> forQuery i'm in that channel, too.
[12:11:56] <DeltaHeavy> forQuery: Usually people in #css just have an issue with stubborn people who can't explain their issues properly :p
[12:18:05] <forQuery> yes, probably this is me
[12:19:15] <forQuery> im rude sometimes, i dont mean to be, sry
[12:31:03] <jarr0dsz> hi everyone, im trying to tackle simple thing but unable so far anyone can help me how to pass target to the ajax call in this short snippet? https://gist.github.com/rubytastic/68e923faa4ca1f75c9e4
[12:31:21] <jarr0dsz> i think i cannot pass more vars than html to the method ajax but how to pass target into it
[12:32:09] <robertmaxrees> that's part of the issue.
[12:32:17] <robertmaxrees> also, $(this)( isn't waht you think it is at that point :)
[12:33:18] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/vo6im1r/ is going to get you closer.
[12:33:30] <robertmaxrees> though something tells me the target isn't a jquery object.
[12:33:59] <jarr0dsz> robertmaxrees no its a custom data attribute from my url
[12:34:16] <jarr0dsz> i try to make a method to load a url inside a target div thank you for your suggestion
[12:34:17] <robertmaxrees> so then currentTarget.empty(); and currentTarget.replaceWith(html); won't to anything.
[12:34:34] <robertmaxrees> that function already exists btw.
[12:34:35] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/load/
[12:35:43] <jarr0dsz> robertmaxrees yes but then i have to pass the arguments inside jquery
[12:35:50] <robertmaxrees> you can't do it that way.
[12:36:02] <robertmaxrees> (unless i don't understand what you mean)
[12:36:08] <jarr0dsz> using a data attribute i can provide them just in html which is more handy for me ( im using a higher prog language to generate the html )
[12:36:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:36:42] <jarr0dsz> doing an alert(target) with my code beore the       success: function(html){ works
[12:36:50] <jarr0dsz> its just that passing arguments inside this method does fail
[12:36:59] <robertmaxrees> right, you can't do that.
[12:37:03] <jarr0dsz> i could do       success: function(data){ .. believe it throws the full object again then
[12:37:26] <robertmaxrees> that's the entire response from the ajax call.
[12:37:44] <robertmaxrees> the success callback can take up to three args.
[12:37:53] <jarr0dsz> it works as far as, $(this).data("target").empty(); i want to specify the div there, so i can supply it as variable and not hardcode value
[12:37:55] <robertmaxrees> the returned data, the textStatus, and the jqXHR object.
[12:38:08] <robertmaxrees> you can use .load(); to do that.
[12:39:37] <jarr0dsz> robert so not using success: function(html){ but just using .load you suggest?
[12:39:41] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/821tcay/
[12:39:41] <jarr0dsz> so i can supply my custom variables
[12:39:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to supply custom variables at all.
[12:40:06] <robertmaxrees> check out that link i just pasted.
[12:40:30] <robertmaxrees> that's the rough idea.  won't work without you modifying a few things, but it should get the point across.
[12:42:55] <jarr0dsz> ah i see total wrong approach, im looking into doing it like that thanks very much
[12:50:31] <kikero> hey!
[12:51:07] <kikero> other than using .is(), what is a way of getting the actual type of element (i.e. "p", "input", "textarea")?
[12:51:35] <robertmaxrees> .prop('tagName');
[12:55:40] <claytonzaugg> Is the best way to "copy" text in a <pre> is to use zeroclipboard? From what I've been playing with the last couple of days, including the lucidchart example, this seems to be the best solution
[12:56:16] <DeltaHeavy> Is there any clean way to use something like find() to get the closest child that meet the selector but not any of their children?
[12:58:02] <robertmaxrees> you'd probably have to implement that on your own.
[12:58:23] <DeltaHeavy> I'll probably just refactor some of this stuff then. Thanks!
[12:58:35] <robertmaxrees> i want to say you could use .first(), but i don't know if there's a guarantee that the first element is the first ancestor that matches.
[12:59:17] <DeltaHeavy> Could probably go about this better regardless...
[12:59:40] <robertmaxrees> aye - a recursive function that uses .children() shouldn't be too bad.
[13:01:25] <DeltaHeavy> Maybe I'll do that. People might get pissy if I refactor their stuff too heavily
[13:01:56] <robertmaxrees> imo the real issue is that you have that kind of nesting going on in the first place.
[13:02:01] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: can you take a look at this and tell me if there is a shorter way? http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/eu83gqkb/15/
[13:02:06] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Agree'd
[13:02:36] <DeltaHeavy> robertmaxrees: Using Bootstrap's grid. I want to get the columns that belong to a specific row but there's a <div> in this carousel between the columns an the row.
[13:03:25] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis absolutely.  ou have jquery here :)
[13:03:46] <robertmaxrees> but i have to run right now.  check out using $() to create elements./
[13:03:51] <robertmaxrees> enjoy folks.
[13:03:57] <Kartagis> you too
[13:04:13] <rubyronin> anyone know how to parse json data into a carousel slider?
[13:04:45] <arthurvr> rubyronin: see the tasks as two separated things. First parse json, then pass it to carousel (plugin).
[13:06:12] <rubyronin> arthurvr: I've done just that. But my data won't appear in the carousel
[13:06:27] <arthurvr> you will need to create a fiddle/jsbin I guess

[13:25:34] <dan_j> Is it possible to store hidden data against a select option (separately from the value), without having to create a separate array?
[13:33:05] <tasaif> dan_j: what?
[13:33:42] <dan_j> For example, in VB.net, a control has a .tag which allows  you to store any data.
[13:33:51] <dan_j> Apart from the .value
[13:34:04] <dan_j> Never mind. I'm just being lazy.
[13:34:05] <tasaif> you can store things in data attributes
[13:34:24] <tasaif> data-additional-value='foo'
[13:34:48] <tasaif> $('.some-element').data('additional-value', 'foo')
[13:39:03] <MachineMan> How do i change an object retrieved by .get into an array?
[13:51:16] <tasaif> MachineMan: what do you mean?
[13:51:26] <tasaif> [$el.get(0)]
[13:51:27] <tasaif> ?
[13:55:34] <MachineMan> I’d like to print out some text from an array in my database. I used .get to retrieve it from my database, and the information from my database console.logs properly within the .get function.
[13:58:03] <MachineMan> When I try to print it on the html using .text, it says ‘item is not defined’ (item coming from the .get)
[13:58:50] <MachineMan> im not sure whats going wrong, it could be a scope issue, a type conversion issue or both
[14:04:56] <tasaif> MachineMan: can you put it in a fiddle?
[14:09:38] <dan_j> tasaif: thanks
[14:10:27] <tasaif> np
[14:13:10] <MachineMan> tasaif: New to coding and first time using jsfiddle, here it is http://jsfiddle.net/coroy6dj/
[14:16:49] <tasaif> ok
[14:17:09] <tasaif> in the future, please don't include code that is unnecessary to solving your problem
[14:17:41] <MachineMan> alright, wasnt sure about the conventions. Thanks
[14:18:48] <MachineMan> the only relevant part is the .get part retrieving the item, which should be an array and i need to print that out elsewhere on the page
[14:23:10] <jasonkarns> hi all, I’ve been attempting to follow the discussion regarding distribution of compat builds
[14:23:20] <jasonkarns> but it seems everything is still in flux for the time being.
[14:23:40] <jasonkarns> is it currently possible to get the latest 1.x compat build from npm?
[14:24:25] <tasaif> MachineMan: have you tried putting 'debugger' inside of the get and checking to see what the variable 'item' actually contains?
[14:27:22] <MachineMan> the console log inside the .get is printing properly (contains this: Object {itemid: "item2", jobtitle: "Market researcher in a research company", place: "Amsterdam", companysize: 150, holidays: 25…}
[14:32:59] <nobitanobi> What's the difference between using "*" vs "$" on find selectors? find($("[id*='_style']") vs find($("[id$='_style']")
[14:33:36] <NoiseEee> http://www.456bereastreet.com/archive/200601/css_3_selectors_explained/ @ nobitanobi
[14:36:03] <tasaif> MachineMan: so you want  $.param(item).itemid ?

[14:48:50] <justFredy> hiiiii
[14:49:10] <justFredy> Could you please help me?
[14:49:30] <justFredy> I have a jQueryMobile project
[14:49:53] <justFredy> i have a table loaded if users click on a button
[14:50:06] <justFredy> that table needs to have a delete and update options
[14:50:16] <justFredy> so, I created a button with a modal
[14:51:02] <justFredy> the problem is: It shows the button and the modal inside the table. I expected that the button will launch the modal, but is not like that
[14:51:51] <justFredy> i have something really similar here: http://jsbin.com/qizupiheji
[14:52:14] <justFredy> I feel that I am missing something for render it
[14:52:35] <justFredy> Do you have an idea what is going on?
[14:52:48] <sammich> what's this, jsbin has a 'tidy' button now?
[14:53:59] <tasaif> justFredy: what table?
[14:56:04] <justFredy> hi tasaif, on my project i have a button when you click on it, it loads a table inside a DIV, on each row i have a button (btn-load-modal) , that button will call a modal. But that modal is not rendered as a modal, the content is next to the btn-load-modal
[14:59:16] <tasaif> can you put the problem you're having into a fiddle?
[14:59:33] <tasaif> jsfiddle.net
[14:59:51] <tasaif> please recreate the problem you're having (don't just copy and paste your code)
[15:17:12] <robbieSti> when i dynamically add elements, jquery event handler doesn't seem to recognize them
[15:20:43] <quuxman_> Is there a way to get a scrolling interaction when there's nothing to be scrolled? I want to pick up two-finger swipe, scroll wheel, or anything that would normally cause scrolling
[15:25:04] <quuxman> The only hack which is very far from ideal is to create 1 pixel of scroll distance, and whenever the event is fired, reset the scroll position to 0
[15:25:12] <quuxman> (that I've come up with so far, I mean)
[15:55:25] <tasaif> robbieSti: demonstrate in a fiddle
[15:56:17] <tasaif> quuxman: check this out?
[15:56:17] <tasaif> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mousewheel
[15:56:22] <quuxman> sounds like mousewheel event will work
[15:56:41] <quuxman> tasaif: ah, yes, typed that at the same time. Thanks
[15:56:56] <tasaif> np
[16:26:33] <ashgotti> Evening all. I'm working on a project where I have a group of fields that can be added multiple times (i.e. group "home" that contains address fields). I have a checkbox within "home" that I use to populate the address fields based on previously entered address (think shipping & billing address). What I can't grasp my mind around is how to set up my code so that if address 3 has the prepopulate field checked, it fills in address 3's fields.
[16:28:32] <ashgotti> This is what it looks like (warning: markup heavy because drupal): http://jsfiddle.net/vf3moxjo/
[16:30:57] <tasaif> asheinfeld: where are you storing this information?
[16:31:21] <tasaif> (the values you want to prepopulate with)
[16:32:32] <kokut> Hello, anyone knows if jQuery('.hed_right').find('.fa-phone').css('margin', '10'); might not work on older versions of jquery ? its selecting the element but not applying the css... :\
[16:34:05] <ashgotti> tasaif: sorry, it's another set of address fields that aren't in that example. I have the prepopulating working with the first set but dont' know how to set up my jquery to work if I add another set of address fields below it.
[16:34:06] <kokut> lol fixd it, had to add px xD
[16:36:21] <ashgotti> tasaif: I'm trying $(this).next(ADDRESS1-CLASS).val();
[16:41:48] <tasaif> ashgotti: each set of addresses is in its own container right?
[16:54:07] <ashgotti> tasaif: sorry, had to take the dog out. Yes each address has it's own container. I might be on the right path now
[16:54:28] <tasaif> np, let me know if you hit a roadblock
[16:54:55] <ashgotti> tasaif: plan is to traverse up one level and then use next() to find hte appropriate input
[16:55:12] <tasaif> from the button?
[16:55:37] <ashgotti> tasaif: yes. Can I only go up one parent level?
[16:55:38] <tasaif> can't you select the target directly?
[16:55:51] <tasaif> you can with .parent()
[16:56:04] <tasaif> although I wouldn't recommend navigating this way unless you have to
[16:56:20] <ashgotti> I will have multiple targets. I need to just select the target below my checkbox: http://jsfiddle.net/vf3moxjo/
[16:57:02] <robertmaxrees> why isn't that checkbox in a container with its related inputs?
[16:57:35] <ashgotti> I'm using Drupal and that set of address fields is outputted by a module. I don't have control to put my checkbox in it.
[16:57:44] <robertmaxrees> then add a wrapper around all of ti.
[16:57:46] <robertmaxrees> *it
[17:01:01] <tasaif> after you do what robertmaxrees said, you can do $(this).closest('.class-of-wrapper').find('the things you want')
[17:01:14] <tasaif> from inside the click event
[17:01:43] <robertmaxrees> or just var $myContainer = $(this).closest('.class-of-wrapper');
[17:01:50] <robertmaxrees> then just $myContainer.find() for each thing you wnat.
[17:02:07] <robertmaxrees> also bind to the checkboxe's change event instead of click.
[17:02:12] <ashgotti> Thank you, I'll try it
[17:07:12] <datanity> are both of these variables the same?  http://pastiebin.com/55359f9786d23
[17:07:27] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[17:09:03] <datanity> yes
[17:15:03] <ashgotti> Thank you both, it worked!
[17:19:03] <ashgotti> On a related question, my function runs on DOM ready. I have "Add Another" that adds another set of fields that uses AJAX. How can I have my function start watching the new checkbox?
[17:19:17] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation instead.
[17:19:26] <ashgotti> I'll google that
[17:19:33] <tasaif> master of the quick draw
[17:19:36] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:21:12] <ashgotti> Of course, event delegation. jQuery 101. I did jQuery courses on codeacademy early fall and didn't really get a chance to use it till now
[17:25:18] <ashgotti> Hm.. on('change') doesn't seem to work for me. No errors either.
[17:25:25] <robertmaxrees> that's not event delegation.
[17:25:32] <robertmaxrees> $(parent).on('event', 'child', function() {});
[17:25:44] <robertmaxrees> read the link i sent - it seems like a lot but it's good info.
[17:25:52] <ashgotti> I don't know how to read then. Long day. I'll read again. Thanks for all the help tongith btw. Very much appreciated
[17:26:14] <robertmaxrees> check out the example after "An event-delegation approach attaches an event handler to only one element, the tbody, and the event only needs to bubble up one level (from the clicked tr to tbody):"
[17:26:18] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:27:07] <ashgotti> Oooh. Duh. Pick an element that's always going to be tehre
[17:27:09] <ashgotti> *there
[17:27:14] <robertmaxrees> an ancestor, yeah.
[17:29:26] <ashgotti> beautiful!
[17:29:32] <ashgotti> Thank you again very much.
[17:30:10] <ashgotti> I'm going to have to use this knowledge for a lot more with this project. There are going to be all sorts of complicated mortgage-type calculations that need to be done live with dynamic data.
[17:30:43] <robertmaxrees> event delegation is one of those things you'll use a lot.
[17:31:05] <robertmaxrees> i use it in a lot of cases even if content isn't getting dynamically loaded.  it can cut down on some overhead.
[17:31:16] <ashgotti> It's very elegant
[17:31:25] <ashgotti> No need for conditions at all
[17:31:31] <robertmaxrees> conditions?
[17:31:41] <ashgotti> if var exists, do x
[17:31:48] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[17:31:50] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:32:07] <ashgotti> I was going to run a loop and tie it to the "add more" button. so cumbersome
[17:32:14] <robertmaxrees> hah.
[17:32:19] <ashgotti> Yup
[17:34:52] <ashgotti> I'll probably also be using this for a small table of contents panel that displays all the fields on the page so the user can easily navigate to them. There can be +100 fields :S
[17:35:16] <robertmaxrees> that's another fantastic use case.
[17:35:21] <ashgotti> So I was going to loop through all the inputs & selects, grab their labels, and link to them.
[18:28:15] <jquery612> Is there a way that I implement a search feature for filtering users from a list? indexOf is good, but there is no array holding the users or the data coming in, its loaded when the page loads (php script puts it there) is there a way I can filter it by the element tags from what I enter in the field?
[18:30:39] <furoido> is there a flipbook plugin that uses pdf?
[18:39:12] <acidjazz> furoido: yes your mom
[18:56:05] <furoido> :O
[19:02:24] <acidjazz> furoido: sorry i need to throw out a yourmom
[19:02:37] <acidjazz> uhmm that would be pretty nuts to process a .pdf client side
[19:02:45] <acidjazz> i dont think thats really possible
[19:03:02] <acidjazz> i know there are node modules to parse pdf
[19:03:06] <acidjazz> but thats server-side
[19:44:02] <broofa> jquery.mobile question... is this the right channel?
[19:47:23] <notsohuman> Is there any idea integration for jquery
[19:47:33] <notsohuman> I meant ide
[19:48:00] <broofa> I'm doing a non-ajax form POST to "/foo" (i.e. page reloads as "/foo"), however the page is a error page (data-role="page") with data-url="/error".  Is there any way to get jQM to recognize this so that when i then try to do a *ajax* navigation to /foo, jQM is aware the current page isn't actually "/foo"?
[21:19:37] <rubyronin> how do I implement an even & odd for loop with jquery? http://jsfiddle.net/2v6wgh40/3/
[21:28:26] <rcyr> Wut?
[21:55:51] <DeltaHeavy> rubyonrailed: Probably just a for loop with     isEven = i % 2 ? true : false;
[21:55:53] <DeltaHeavy> Or something like that
[21:56:28] <rubyonrailed> rubyronin DeltaHeavy
