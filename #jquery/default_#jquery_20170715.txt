[00:46:57] <latemus> i'm trying to iterate over ever object within a $.map... what have i got wrong with the inner each() ? termbin.com/31uj
[00:47:06] <latemus> s/ever/every/
[00:48:26] <latemus> woops, that's termbin.com/vroh
[01:37:48] <latemus> why is it so hard to iterate over objects within a map? should i nest map within map?
[01:52:07] <latemus> here's what i have, but i need to put each item contained within the 'value' array into it's own span tagset. https://jsfiddle.net/hd715aer/
[01:57:13] <latemus> what does prefacing a variable name with $ do
[01:57:27] <latemus> i thought js had no sigils
[01:57:42] <latemus> or isnt $ jquery
[02:35:27] <Uhkis> latemus: something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/hd715aer/1/
[02:43:32] <latemus> Uhkis: oh man, that is exactly what i wanted! thanks
[02:43:54] <latemus> i was futzing around with .each inside .map, and it was not working!
[02:46:20] <latemus> thank you very much

[04:28:00] <SpeedyG> hey, i've got this page where links are nicely opened into a specific <div> but when the sub-page contains links too, I cannot get those links to open in the same <div> (so basically reload the page with new content), any pointers on how to fix this?
[04:28:50] <SpeedyG> if I load the same .js file into the subpage, it does work, but that seems like an ugly hack to me...
[05:46:47] <ahoo> with fadeOut, is there a way to specify the amount of steps (for making it smoother)?
[08:55:54] <jak2000> hi all

[11:34:32] <johnwoo> hi. how can i just add the PDF icon next to the red <li>? https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ZyPNgg
[11:35:19] <royal_screwup21> I'm looking for a widget, which when clicked shows extends itself outwards and shows some data inside of it. Something like Facebook's "check who's online" at the bottom right of the screen, only simpler. What should I be looking into?
[15:23:20] <depesz> hi. i'm just starting learning js and jquery. I'm trying to add combobox to my page - like this one: http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#combobox
[15:23:31] <depesz> but I'd like it not to fail if user will type-in new, unknown value.
[15:23:35] <depesz> Is it possible?
[19:57:59] <jonez> greetings
[19:58:51] <jonez> I am trying to figure out how to parse a string of html into a dom object so I can step through the children. my project is to make a 'topbar' w a number of elements, each of which can be updated via ajax and some css animation.
[19:59:22] <jonez> I get a string of html from my server side code (python), and I'd like to convert it to dom objects if that is in fact the easiest way to do this. any ideas? :)
[20:29:00] <jonez> greetings. having a hard time doing $("<div />").append(string-of-html-incomplete-document)... I always get an empty.
