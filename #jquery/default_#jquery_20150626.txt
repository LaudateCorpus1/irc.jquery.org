[00:05:37] <aka_007> Hi. I am using jquery resizable plugin (with handles). On using this plugin with a div (whose position absolute and positioned on right part of browser), I am experiencing weird behavior
[00:06:41] <aka_007> On dragging the w(west) handler to resize the div horizontally, the entire div shifts to left side of screen
[00:11:34] <Bjerre>  $('.leftFocus', '#ballbtn1').on('click', function (e) {
[00:11:49] <Bjerre> is this wrong?
[00:12:39] <Kartagis> nope
[00:12:40] <Bjerre> I want the function to work when you click on either .leftFocus or #ballbtn1
[00:15:54] <Bjerre> doesn't work Kartagis
[00:16:07] <Bjerre> when I added #ballbtn1 it stopped working
[00:16:16] <Bjerre> not possible to have several selectors?
[00:21:53] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/bot0o9dx/
[00:21:56] <Kartagis> Bjerre: ^
[00:33:57] <Bjerre> Kartagis: http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/bot0o9dx/1/
[00:34:11] <Bjerre> I want leftFocus to add class to ballbtn1
[00:34:21] <Bjerre> and rightFocus to add class to ballbtn2
[00:34:34] <Bjerre> as well as clicking on ballbtn1 adds class to itself
[00:34:39] <furoido> <a href="link.com" id="link"> how do I extract the "link.com"?
[00:34:46] <Bjerre> and clicking on ballbtn2 adds class to itself
[00:35:00] <furoido> i know on input its field.attr("href")
[00:35:08] <furoido> but for a?
[00:35:48] <Bjerre> $("a").attr("href") ?
[00:36:34] <Kartagis> Bjerre: have you even seen my fiddle
[00:36:44] <Bjerre> yes I saw it Kartagis
[00:36:47] <Bjerre> thank you btw
[00:36:47] <Bjerre> but
[00:36:53] <Bjerre> as you see in my version
[00:36:56] <Bjerre> there is 4 buttons in total
[00:37:18] <Kartagis> $('.leftFocus, #ballBtn1'
[00:37:41] <Kartagis> not '.leftFocus', '#ballBtn1'
[00:37:51] <Bjerre> oh
[00:37:52] <Kartagis> see the difference?
[00:37:55] <Bjerre> I missed that completely
[00:37:56] <Bjerre> sorry
[00:37:58] <Bjerre> thanks man
[00:37:58] <Kartagis> np
[00:39:02] <Kartagis> and I think you want to toggleClass, unless you really want addClass
[00:39:29] <furoido> thnakyou
[00:39:40] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/bot0o9dx/2/
[00:39:43] <Kartagis> Bjerre: ^
[00:40:20] <Bjerre> awesome Kartagis!
[00:40:37] <Bjerre> now I only need to find a way to lock the one that got clicked with the new class
[00:40:48] <Bjerre> perhaps addClass works better then?
[00:40:54] <Kartagis> lock?
[00:40:56] <maloik> A lot of plugins require you to activate them with something along the lines of $('.foo').selectize(); if I want one of the options on initialization to be the value of a data attribute of the element, how would I accomplish that?
[00:41:02] <Bjerre> yea it should stay active
[00:41:09] <Kartagis> what do you mean lock?
[00:41:14] <Bjerre> and if you click on the other one after the first click nothing should happen
[00:46:53] <Uhkis> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/bot0o9dx/3/ like this?
[00:53:16] <Bjerre> excactly Uhkis! thank you man!
[00:55:43] <Bjerre> oh, is it possible to make it disable all the other buttons instead of the only linked one after click?
[00:55:52] <Bjerre> as well as the one that is clicked
[00:56:28] <Bjerre> it's a SPA so it will be reloaded when going back to it's page. The class will be a animation so that's why I want to lock them or disable them
[00:56:49] <Bjerre> I'm bad at describing things, sorry
[00:59:30] <tumulte> Hello
[01:00:13] <tumulte> I'm using a $(window).on('scroll'...) that doesn't work on production serveurs. But $('body').on('scroll'...) does
[01:00:17] <Bjerre> hello tumulte
[01:00:36] <tumulte> Does it make any sense, or am I looking at the wrong direction ?
[01:01:01] <Bjerre> you can scroll the body since it's height is set
[01:01:09] <Bjerre> that would be my guess
[01:01:26] <Bjerre> or the bodys content is below the screen
[01:02:05] <Bjerre> Uhkis: is it possible to disable all the buttons after you click on one of them?
[01:02:58] <Uhkis> Bjerre: http://jsfiddle.net/bot0o9dx/4/
[01:03:04] <tumulte> Bjerre: the dom is slightly different between the 2 environments... that might explain
[01:03:33] <Bjerre> aah smart one Uhkis
[01:03:59] <Bjerre> perfect Uhkis
[01:04:01] <Bjerre> <3
[01:15:01] <Bjerre> ok now it starts to get interesting http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/bot0o9dx/5/
[01:15:36] <Bjerre> left and right arrow together with click? Is it possible to disable even them? Vice versa for using keybinds to disable click?
[01:16:27] <Bjerre> sorry here http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/bot0o9dx/6/
[01:18:35] <Bjerre> for an example. If you click on any buttons it will disable left and right arrow. Another example (vice versa) is that you hit left arrow which then disables mouse click
[01:28:17] <amtrivedi> hello,
[01:28:17] <amtrivedi> I have a parent form and on the same page I can access a jquery dialog form via button click. Now the problem is both these forms have same field "name", as a result when I try to submit the popup form it tries to submit the "name" field of the parent form.
[01:28:41] <arup_r> guys any any idea why am I getting this error ? https://github.com/dubrox/Multiple-Dates-Picker-for-jQuery-UI/issues/141
[01:28:47] <amtrivedi> How do I ensure that when the "name" field of the popup form is filled it should submit popup form only?
[01:29:08] <Cork> amtrivedi: don't select the form based on the name
[01:29:09] <amtrivedi> I don't want to change the name of the fields.
[01:29:23] <Cork> ex. select the dialog and the form inside it and you should get it working
[01:29:52] <amtrivedi> Cork: Could you elaborate a bit?
[01:30:03] <Cork> $('#dialog form').submit()
[01:31:15] <amtrivedi> Cork: http://dpaste.com/1NSBKM0
[01:31:29] <amtrivedi> I am sorry it is a raw snippet.
[01:31:38] <Cork> so you mean id not name?
[01:31:47] <amtrivedi> And is not entirely correct.
[01:32:06] <amtrivedi> Cork: I did not get you.
[01:32:25] <Bjerre> any idea on how to disable all the buttons including arrow keys after you either click or use arrow key? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/bot0o9dx/6/
[01:32:54] <amtrivedi> Cork: the p tag you can see is the "name" field of the original page.
[01:33:11] <amtrivedi> Cork: Adn in the popup I have another "name" field
[01:33:29] <amtrivedi> Now when I try to submit the "name" field of the popup
[01:33:34] <Cork> no i don't see those
[01:33:42] <amtrivedi> It thinks that I am submitting the parent form.
[01:33:43] <Cork> the dpaste is quite limited in it's content
[01:34:20] <amtrivedi> Cork: http://dpaste.com/1PJA5CS
[01:34:26] <amtrivedi> This is the template for popup.
[01:35:04] <Cork> uh...
[01:35:13] <Cork> you know how html works right?
[01:35:21] <amtrivedi> Cork: Yeah.
[01:35:25] <Bjerre> {{ in html?
[01:35:26] <Cork> there isn't any names given in that dpaste either
[01:35:40] <Cork> no that is the tempalate
[01:35:53] <doug__> amtrivedi: you need to handle the 'submit' event. if you don't want to let the submit actually happen, call event.preventDefault() assuming the event handler callback parameter is named 'event'
[01:36:16] <Cork> doug__: that isn't really the problem
[01:36:25] <amtrivedi> Cork: Actually these forms are django forms.
[01:36:27] <Cork> he haven't even shown how he binds the event at all
[01:36:52] <Cork> amtrivedi: you still have to check the generated html
[01:37:14] <Cork> "form with the same name" would mean <form name="something"></form>
[01:37:42] <Cork> so you have to explain/show exactly what you're trying to access
[01:37:53] <amtrivedi> doug__: I think you are somewhat right, that is what I need.
[01:38:17] <amtrivedi> Cork: One sec.
[01:39:05] <amtrivedi> Cork: You have knowledge of Django?
[01:39:16] <Bjerre> only Unchained
[01:39:17] <Cork> amtrivedi: sure, but it doesn't matter
[01:39:17] <Bjerre> :E
[01:39:35] <Cork> what matters is the generated html, and the jquery code you're trying to run on it
[01:39:48] <doug__> it isn't legal to nest forms right? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/379610/can-you-nest-html-forms
[01:39:56] <Cork> ya, it isn't
[01:40:00] <amtrivedi> Cork: I have two models
[01:40:06] <amtrivedi> Preparation
[01:40:10] <amtrivedi> product
[01:40:19] <Cork> amtrivedi: could you show what it is you are doing please?
[01:40:34] <Cork> instead of wasting our time?
[01:40:41] <amtrivedi> Okay, let me dpaste it
[01:40:44] <Bjerre> Cork: relax
[01:40:55] <Bjerre> use jsfiddle if you can amtrivedi
[01:41:05] <Cork> that isn't really the problem
[01:41:17] <Cork> the problem is that what he is asking about isn't in the dpastes
[01:41:22] <Cork> so we have to sit and guess
[01:41:27] <Bjerre> ok I see
[01:41:31] <tumulte> how does on('scroll' works ? I mean, why does the behavior changes when I resize the window ? (ie : stop working in dstop mode)
[01:41:39] <tumulte> for $(body)
[01:41:55] <tumulte> and stops working on mobile mode for $(window)
[01:41:56] <doug__> Bjerre: I love the scene where the guy describes what they do with miners that have exhausted their usefulness. hard to believe that humans are such savages
[01:41:59] <Bjerre> use document instead tumulte?
[01:42:05] <Cork> tumulte: when the browser scrolls the area on an element with overflow scroll or auto
[01:42:10] <Cork> tumulte: it fires an event
[01:42:12] <Bjerre> haha indeed doug__
[01:42:21] <Cork> tumulte: and no, resize doesn't fire scroll
[01:42:32] <Cork> unless the resize causes the scroll position to change
[01:42:59] <Bjerre> what scroll function are you trying to use tumulte
[01:43:12] <Cork> Bjerre: he just stated thqat
[01:43:12] <Bjerre> smooth scroll or just fire events when scrolling?
[01:43:19] <Cork> <tumulte> how does on('scroll' works ? <--
[01:43:32] <tumulte> Cork: I know, but it's triggered on mobile with $('body') and with  $('window') on desktop. But not the other way aaround
[01:43:34] <Bjerre> ye but I mean what is he trying to do on scrolling Cork
[01:43:57] <Cork> tumulte: ya, mobile is special
[01:44:05] <Cork> it shouldn't ever be body though
[01:44:18] <Cork> unless you set body { overflow: scroll; } in the css
[01:44:20] <amtrivedi> Cork: http://dpaste.com/1ZX0K4D
[01:44:29] <amtrivedi> This is my parent html.
[01:44:30] <doug__> Cork: why not? if it has to scroll because wordwrap changed
[01:44:42] <Cork> doug__: cause body isn't the top most element
[01:44:47] <Cork> it shouldn't have overflow
[01:45:01] <tumulte> Cork: ok it starts to make sense
[01:45:04] <Cork> tumulte: window or document should work though
[01:45:08] <amtrivedi> Cork: http://dpaste.com/2HEHDW2
[01:45:13] <amtrivedi> This is the popup form.
[01:45:20] <Cork> finally a form
[01:45:28] <amtrivedi> I hope this is helpful.
[01:45:31] <Cork> amtrivedi: and how are you selecting the form?
[01:45:38] <Cork> amtrivedi: not yet no...
[01:45:38] <amtrivedi> Do you require the forms.py as well?
[01:45:52] <Cork> amtrivedi: i need the jquery code...
[01:46:05] <doug__> if you're at the end of the document, and you make the window taller, it will "pull" the document down, so there is no empty space at the bottom, causing scroll
[01:46:38] <Cork> doug__: ya
[01:47:03] <Cork> if you are at the bottom of the page and change so the page becomes shorter or the window taller
[01:47:07] <Cork> you will cause scroll
[01:47:17] <doug__> ya
[01:47:22] <amtrivedi> Cork: http://dpaste.com/1NSBKM0#line-15
[01:47:48] <Cork> amtrivedi: that is just ajax
[01:47:54] <Cork> it doesn't care about the submit button
[01:48:14] <amtrivedi> This is all I have written.
[01:48:24] <Cork> so... the question isn't jquery related?
[01:48:33] <Cork> its a pure django question?
[01:48:49] <amtrivedi> I am not sure about it myself.
[01:48:52] <Cork> in that case => #django
[01:49:03] <amtrivedi> I think I need an event listner.
[01:49:07] <Cork> well as you don't have a submit handler it at least doesn't belong in here
[01:49:16] <amtrivedi> When I am submitting the popup.
[01:49:22] <Bjerre> Any idea on how to disable all arrow keys and clicks after you hit one of them? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/bot0o9dx/6/
[01:49:24] <Cork> ya, but that just loads the form
[01:50:32] <amtrivedi> Oh, so then I guess an event handler is what I need, I may use .submit() so that it submits the popup and not the parent form.
[01:50:50] <Cork> amtrivedi: is any of the forms working at all?
[01:51:00] <Cork> cause then you most likely isn't using ajax for them
[01:51:07] <Cork> and then no js doesn't matter in that case
[01:51:13] <amtrivedi> Forms are working.
[01:51:20] <amtrivedi> I am able to submit the parent form.
[01:51:26] <amtrivedi> And able to access the popup form.
[01:51:31] <Cork> amtrivedi: do you really mean parent form?
[01:51:44] <Cork> as in <form> ...<form></form>...</form> ?
[01:52:02] <amtrivedi> Cork: I mean to say the main form of the page (not the popup one)
[01:52:18] <Cork> is the popup appended inside the other form?
[01:52:33] <amtrivedi> The main form has a button.
[01:52:36] <Cork> is the popup appended inside the other form?
[01:52:45] <amtrivedi> Clicking on the button opens the popup.
[01:52:50] <Cork> sigh
[01:52:54] <amtrivedi> Via ajax I am loading another template.
[01:52:55] <Cork> is the popup appended inside the other form? <-- please answer this
[01:53:16] <amtrivedi> No.
[01:53:31] <doug__> Cork: the return false?
[01:53:41] <Cork> doug__: that is just for the popup
[01:53:45] <Cork> shouldn't matter
[01:54:00] <Cork> but it's too fragmented to tell what exactly is happening
[01:54:16] <Cork> can't even tell if the first form are submitted at all
[01:54:43] <Cork> or if the button wit the onclick actually have anything to do with that form *sigh*
[01:54:52] <tumulte> Cork: what if neight $(document) nor $(window) work for on scroll ?
[01:55:01] <doug__> Cork: the default type for button is type="submit"
[01:55:15] <doug__> if you return false that won't it cancel the submit?
[01:55:26] <Cork> tumulte: do $([document, window]).on('scroll', func) work?
[01:55:36] <Cork> doug__: no, cause it isn't a submit
[01:55:39] <Cork> it is a click handler
[01:55:41] <Bjerre> tumulte: You got any sample of the problems you have that you could link via jsfiddle.net?
[01:55:45] <Bjerre> !paste
[01:55:46] <b-ot> Bjerre: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[01:55:53] <doug__> on a button type="submit"
[01:55:55] <Cork> and no return false on a click handler doesn't cancel a submit
[01:56:00] <Cork> doug__: doesn't matter
[01:56:10] <Cork> the event he cancels are click not submit
[01:56:22] <doug__> yes yes, I'm saying, does amtrivedi think it cancels the submit
[01:56:25] <Cork> so the submit event still happens, IF the button is actually inside a form
[01:56:34] <Cork> and i don't think it is
[01:56:46] <Cork> and that would explain why one "form" works and the other doesn't
[01:56:59] <Cork> cause it is a button triggering an unrelated ajax call
[01:57:06] <Cork> not a form submit
[01:57:24] <Cork> but again, its just me guessing and hunching
[01:57:30] <Bjerre> that's similar to the problem I had with jsslides
[01:57:35] <Cork> cause there haven't been enough info to tell
[01:58:24] <Cork> amtrivedi: the best solution is to load the page in a browser
[01:58:34] <Cork> open the source code viewer of your browser
[01:58:44] <Cork> and copy the generated related sections of the html and js
[01:58:46] <doug__> first of all, don't use on* attributes, use an event listener with .on(...). second, if you want to block/validate/process submits, handle the submit event, not some click that you happen to know is going to submit it
[01:58:49] <Cork> THAT is what matters here
[01:58:59] <Cork> not what variables and functions you have server side
[01:59:21] <Cork> doug__: true, but don't premature instruct a solution
[01:59:28] <Cork> we really don't know what is happening here
[01:59:54] <Cork> the click might not even be related to the real problem
[02:00:11] <Bjerre> isn't it possible to add external source to django?
[02:00:16] <Bjerre> and paste it on fiddle?
[02:00:32] <Cork> django doesn't matter
[02:00:32] <Bjerre> or does submit not work without hosting?
[02:00:38] <Cork> what matters is the generated html
[02:01:03] <Bjerre> ok
[02:01:45] <doug__> Cork: it's pretty obviously an onclick handler that thinks it is going to submit it with ajax and thinks it is going to prevent default with the return false. the problem is that it should be onsubmit on the form, not onclick on the button
[02:02:34] <Bjerre> Any idea on how to disable all arrow keys and clicks after you trigger one of them? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/bot0o9dx/6/
[02:02:45] <doug__> if it were onsubmit on the form, that return false would prevent the normal submit
[02:03:20] <doug__> OR, that button should be type="button"
[02:03:54] <Bjerre> and there he left :P
[02:04:14] <jak2000> how to pass to a function as parameters 3 select/options its name/id: sel1,sel2,sel3: php code: waux="<select name='xcombcatvar2' id='xcombcatvar2'"+"onchange='showInvDisponible_salavari(sel1, sel2, sel3)' >"; any advice?
[02:04:19] <doug__> or there is some omitted information that somehow disproves that line of inference
[02:05:01] <Cork> doug__: sure, but you don't have how it relates to the form
[02:05:11] <jak2000> Cork any advice?
[02:05:24] <doug__> it's obvious
[02:05:41] <Cork> jak2000: don't use event attributes
[02:05:42] <Bjerre> Cork: now I understand how you felt yesterday
[02:05:46] <Bjerre> sorry about that
[02:05:51] <doug__> a button that does ajax then lets the form submit. common mistake
[02:06:06] <Cork> doug__: i don't think the button is a submit button
[02:06:12] <Cork> cause i don't think it is actually IN the form
[02:06:17] <Cork> i think it is after it
[02:06:17] <doug__> why not? the default is submit
[02:06:27] <Cork> <form></form><button></button>
[02:06:30] <Cork> not a submit button
[02:06:40] <doug__> ah
[02:06:43] <Cork> but again, just guessing
[02:07:02] <jak2000> <Cork> jak2000: don't use event attributes <--------------- then?
[02:07:08] <jak2000> onchange event?
[02:07:14] <Cork> jak2000: to start with more context
[02:07:15] <doug__> can't you infer that the button is in the form, since his opening problem was preventing submits?
[02:07:25] <Cork> create a jsfiddle with the code you're trying to use
[02:08:07] <jak2000> Cork is hard hard... i am use aajax and is complicated
[02:08:08] <Cork> doug__: from the pastes he has created it looks like {{ product_form.name }} includes the form tags
[02:08:13] <jak2000> i tell you more,
[02:08:16] <Cork> doug__: and that includes the closing tag
[02:08:24] <Cork> so no, i don't think button is inside the form
[02:08:34] <Cork> but again, just guessing
[02:08:44] <amtrivedi> Cork: The button is inside the main form.
[02:08:54] <amtrivedi> Clicking on this button opens the popup form.
[02:08:58] <Cork> amtrivedi: could you please show that?
[02:09:07] <trol00> hey I'm using JSON.parse to send something to the server using jQuery.post and it works everywhere but not in android 2?? it's a simple object, null or sometimes undefined...
[02:09:09] <Cork> currently there is only lose fragments to go on...
[02:09:22] <jak2000> i have a button, that display a showmodal window with 3 select option (and display data in a table) i want: when user change any select/option, i want filter the table, i am think in, detect wich values was changed and again call the ajax function,
[02:09:28] <arthurvr> trol00: yep there's a bug in android 2.3 which doesn't makes JSON.parse not handle null values properly. Use jQuery.parseJSON and it will work as you'd expect. It works around it.
[02:09:34] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/a644101ed04d0beacea864ce805e0c4f86ba1cd1/src/ajax/parseJSON.js#L5
[02:09:38] <Cork> ouch
[02:09:46] * Cork makes a mental note
[02:10:12] <trol00> as always #jquery just saved my day
[02:10:14] <trol00> thanks
[02:10:38] <Cork> jak2000: you need to show where the variables exist in relation to the string you showed
[02:10:41] <Cork> and so on
[02:10:45] <trol00> thanks everybody
[02:10:55] <Cork> jak2000: as you use event attribute you are limited to global scope
[02:11:03] <trol00> i didn't know about this at all
[02:11:09] <trol00> i just use JSON.parse everywhere?
[02:11:12] <Cork> trol00: me nether
[02:11:23] <trol00> I should probably go fix that everywhere now... :/
[02:11:53] <Cork> trol00: if you use $.parseJSON you will get the fix
[02:12:05] <Cork> else just append + "" to the end of the string
[02:12:09] <Cork> (like parseJSON does)
[02:12:19] <arthurvr> Cork: trol00: you learned something today :) it’s an edge case though. Everything works fine if you use the method as you’re expected to use it
[02:12:25] <amtrivedi1> Cork: http://dpaste.com/0BN6PA8#line-6
[02:12:43] <Cork> sigh
[02:12:48] <Cork> amtrivedi1: ok, i drop this now
[02:12:59] <Cork> you keep posting the same incomplete django code
[02:13:09] <Cork> instead of the html i've been asking for for ages now
[02:13:13] <arthurvr> so that’s why people should read the jQuery source code lol
[02:13:20] <jak2000> also i try: waux="<select name='xcombcatvar2' id='xcombcatvar2'"+"onchange='showInvDisponible_salavari(document.getElementById('sel1').value, document.getElementById('sel2').value, document.getElementById('sel3').value)' >";   but not work :(
[02:13:44] <trol00> arthurvr: ur right I should try to get in that habit
[02:13:56] <Cork> jak2000: you need to share more context, we can't tell what your problem is from that
[02:14:06] <trol00> arthurvr: but every time I download and open it I don't understand anything of it
[02:14:10] <Cork> jak2000: one thing though is that you aren't adding spaces between the attributes
[02:14:18] <amtrivedi1> Cork: No problem, maybe I was not able to understand what you required. Thanks for your time though!
[02:16:27] <Bjerre> Need some advice on how to disable clicks and arrow keys after one has been triggered. It works for the same event but not if you combine a click and arrow key. http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/bot0o9dx/6/
[02:22:01] <trol00> why is the release date of jQuery 3 so secret?
[02:22:59] <Cork> prob cause they haven't decided what should be in it yet
[02:23:22] <arthurvr> trol00: monday noon we give away all our secrets in a public meeting on irc :p
[02:23:49] <arthurvr> and what Cork said, too
[02:25:41] <Bjerre> arthurvr: are you involved in coding jquery?
[02:26:10] <arthurvr> Bjerre: nah I do documentation stuff (I do follow up on all the things though)
[02:26:32] <Bjerre> ok cool :)
[02:27:29] <Bjerre> how would you describe what the benefits are by using jquery and not pure javascript?
[02:27:34] <jak2000> Cork you reffer to onchange event?
[02:27:55] <Cork> jak2000: the onchange event attribute ya (the one you should replace)
[02:28:10] <arthurvr> Bjerre: for me personally, the hunderds of bugs in browsers (even modern ones) it works around
[02:28:34] <jak2000> yes i see, i bad typed here.
[02:29:35] <Bjerre> arthurvr: never had any bugs related to pure javascripts but it's only because I'm kind of new to it. Any small example?
[02:29:58] <Cork> Bjerre: there are tons of them
[02:30:02] <arthurvr> Bjerre: the example of a half hour ago :p
[02:30:21] <Bjerre> the parse?
[02:30:27] <Cork> the latest one biting me is that chrome doesn't pixel snap if you transform an element
[02:30:43] <arthurvr> Bjerre: and in general people don’t run into many bugs because they don’t know they exist and because they don’t test enough…
[02:30:44] <Bjerre> css Cork
[02:30:46] <arthurvr> Bjerre: yep
[02:31:02] <Bjerre> and you should use translate instead of position
[02:31:14] <Bjerre> which gets to my other question that I had yesterday
[02:31:28] <Cork> uh... who said anything about position?
[02:31:32] <arthurvr> Bjerre: super easy thing but I bet 99% of you didn’t know about this super nasty android 2.3 thing
[02:31:44] <Bjerre> I had no idea arthurvr
[02:32:22] <Bjerre> I missread that Cork I was thinking about my own experience I had
[02:32:28] <Bjerre> but it was the opposite
[02:32:44] <Bjerre> where I want to get rid of pixel snap
[02:32:51] <Cork> Bjerre: transform: translate(-50%, -50%); can cause chrome to render 1px lines as 2px lines
[02:33:01] <Cork> cause it puts the line between two pixels and doesn't snap it
[02:33:04] <Bjerre> :o
[02:33:12] <Cork> bit me yesterday
[02:33:15] <Bjerre> jquery fixes that Cork?
[02:33:15] <arthurvr> yep ^ pretty annoying actually
[02:33:25] <tumulte> Cork:  only $([window, 'body']) works. Why ? I dunno
[02:33:33] <Cork> tumulte: ah, sorry
[02:33:44] <Cork> oh, wait
[02:33:57] <Cork> tumulte: hmm, i might remember wrong about mobile then
[02:34:10] <Bjerre> can I ask you something Cork?
[02:34:12] <Cork> was a few months since i last played with scroll events there
[02:34:18] <Cork> Bjerre: you just did
[02:34:27] <Bjerre> in tumulte's case, why was it window, 'body' and not 'window, body'
[02:34:38] <Cork> window is an object
[02:34:42] <Cork> body isn't
[02:34:49] <Cork> though i didn't think 'body' should work
[02:35:00] <Bjerre> ok I see
[02:35:06] <Cork> $([window, document.body]) is what i would expect
[02:35:14] <Bjerre> yea
[02:35:27] <Cork> unless jquery has gotten smarter and finds selectors in the array
[02:35:36] <Cork> it didn't last i read the code
[02:36:43] <arthurvr> you can perfectly pass an array but there are some edge cases
[02:37:06] <Cork> arthurvr: so $(['div', 'span']) works?
[02:37:52] <arthurvr> no it should be all DOM elements
[02:37:54] <arthurvr> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery-elementArray
[02:38:04] <Cork> ya, that was the part i talked about :)
[02:38:10] <arthurvr> ah okay :p
[02:38:17] <Cork> $(['body']) <--
[02:38:24] <Cork> the array i added
[02:38:28] <arthurvr> oh yeah that won’t work
[02:38:29] <Cork> but i use window, document
[02:42:16] <trol00> wow the jQuery code style is ugly
[02:42:33] <trol00> just reading one method and my god..
[02:42:34] <Cork> lol
[02:42:42] <Cork> it isn't that bad
[02:42:58] <arthurvr> Cork: did you see our recent updates? this way it’s really an ugly thing bro.
[02:43:14] <Cork> i've been heads down for about 3 months
[02:43:21] <Cork> summer and all that :)
[02:43:32] <arthurvr> Cork: had a fun summer?
[02:43:40] <arthurvr> thing thing -> https://github.com/jquery/learn.jquery.com/pull/661/files#r33341907 (the spacing)
[02:43:43] <arthurvr> it’s soo hard the worst
[02:43:48] <Cork> the summer is just starting :)
[02:43:50] <Bjerre> Need some advice on how to disable clicks and arrow keys after one has been triggered. It works for the same event but not if you combine a click and arrow key. http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/bot0o9dx/6/
[02:44:27] <Cork> arthurvr: you mean the spaces around the arguments?
[02:44:58] <arthurvr> in the past we had exceptions for functions so you ended up $(function() {}) but now it’s $( function() {} );
[02:45:06] <arthurvr> which feels terribly wrong to me at least
[02:45:12] <arthurvr> bye });
[02:45:54] <tumulte> Cork: yeah you're right [document.body, window] is what to do. Still can't understand why
[02:48:09] <trol00> arthurvr: yeah it were those that I meant it's pretty ugly
[02:48:14] <trol00> } );
[02:48:15] <trol00> lol
[02:50:04] <trol00> are there any new features coming to 3.0?
[02:50:54] <arthurvr> jQuery is feature-wise complete, trol00. The biggest change is browser support as explained in our blog post
[02:51:20] <trol00> oh I saw new features on the api site popping up?
[02:51:24] <arthurvr> only one thing
[02:51:35] <arthurvr> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/#jQuery-get-settings
[02:51:46] <arthurvr> (and on jQuery.post too of course)
[02:52:24] <trol00> oh okay
[02:52:40] <trol00> just searching the list of methods on the api site
[02:53:05] <trol00> i never use any callbacks method
[02:54:34] <trol00> what's jQuery.noop?
[02:54:44] <arthurvr> jQuery.noop = function() {};
[02:55:15] <arthurvr> quite literally ”An empty function.”
[02:55:31] <trol00> I don't use any queues eighter
[02:55:40] <trol00> i should dig into some more things one day
[02:55:49] <Cork> ah, ya i love $.noop
[02:55:53] <Cork> makes code much cleaner
[02:56:10] <trol00> what's jQuery.cssNumber?
[02:56:19] <Cork> it parses numbers from css strings
[02:56:37] <arthurvr> nope that’s not true
[02:56:41] <arthurvr> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.cssNumber/
[02:56:56] <Cork> ah, the other way around
[02:56:59] <arthurvr> it’s a list object containing all things jQuery can’t add `px` to
[02:57:22] <arthurvr> .css() adds px when you pass it a number, but not on these properties in specific
[02:57:59] <trol00> such as z-index?
[02:58:01] <arthurvr> yep
[02:58:38] <arthurvr> added in 1.4.3 and documented (by me, btw) a few months ago
[02:59:06] <trol00> cork: what has this to do with convert to/from a number?
[02:59:12] <trol00> don't fully understand
[02:59:36] <Cork> trol00: it converts pure js numbers to a unit the browser will accept
[02:59:59] <arthurvr> nah .css() does that not cssNumber
[03:00:18] <arthurvr> cssNumber is just an object
[03:00:28] <Cork> bleh, right its just an array
[03:00:34] <Cork> too long since i read this
[03:00:39] <Cork> lol...
[03:00:41] <Cork> *object
[03:00:45] <arthurvr> it’s an object of values set to `true`
[03:01:00] * Cork focuses on his ruby gunk again...
[03:01:21] <arthurvr> if you want to prevent css from adding px to, say, width you can use: jQuery.cssNumber.width = true;
[03:01:40] <trol00> okay
[03:01:44] <trol00> didn't know that
[03:01:48] <trol00> doesn't sound useful eighter
[03:02:17] <arthurvr> it’s useful if you’re still on an older version as some new css properties were only added to it in recent versions
[03:02:38] <PurpleBagel> Hi. I've got a string with some html (which might look like this : "<h1>a</h1> <h1>b</h1>")  - what's the best way to parse it to jquery and then back to a string again? I can't seem to find a good jquery method to parse multiple elements to html
[03:03:32] <Cork> PurpleBagel: $.parseHTML
[03:03:57] <Cork> converting it back to html is a bit tougher though
[03:04:01] <jak2000> Cork i found something interesting:
[03:04:06] <jak2000> on my problem:
[03:04:31] <jak2000> if i change this: waux="<select name='xcombsalas2' id='xcombsalas2' "+                                 "onchange='showInvDisponible_salavari(7,'"+                                        wprod+"','"+wiprod+"', 8)' >";
[03:04:51] <jak2000> of course wprod, wiprod have values
[03:05:04] <jak2000> if change by: waux="<select name='xcombsalas2' id='xcombsalas2' "+                                 "onchange='showInvDisponible_salavari(7,5,4,8)' >";
[03:05:14] <jak2000> static values it work... which  is worng?
[03:05:17] <PurpleBagel> Cork: yeah, can't seem to find a good jquery method to convert multiple elements to string. .html() only returns the inner content, and .prop("outerHTML") can only handle a single element
[03:05:53] <Cork> PurpleBagel: ya, the best solutions is $('<div>').html(elms).html()
[03:06:04] <Cork> or rather if you absolutely need to get the html
[03:06:10] <Cork> the best solution is to leave it as dom
[03:07:23] <kokut> Hello, anyone knows some reliable and easy to install validation library that supports utf-8?
[03:07:41] <Cork> jquery.validation
[03:07:45] <kokut> for emails, names, address, price in all currencies etc
[03:08:08] <kokut> Cork: k let me check it out, is it reliable?
[03:08:15] <kokut> will that prevent SQL injection?
[03:08:19] <Cork> uh...
[03:08:30] <Cork> you shouldn't do that kinda of validation client side
[03:08:40] <Cork> you MUST always have a server side validation
[03:08:47] <Cork> the js side is just to make it pretty
[03:09:20] <doug__> kokut: the attacker has complete control over the client, you can't even assume they are going to be using a browser, let alone have js on
[03:09:39] <Cork> let alone run the js you sent
[03:09:49] <PurpleBagel> Cork: thanks. I wonder why jquery doesn't have a built in method for doing that. I bet that would save a lot of headache
[03:10:06] <Cork> PurpleBagel: create a plugin if you like
[03:10:06] <kokut> but cant i simply disallow clients that dont have js enabled or something? :\
[03:10:13] <Cork> PurpleBagel: it isn't that common to need it
[03:10:31] <Cork> i basically ever only use it for debugging
[03:10:53] <doug__> the server needs to be bulletproof enough to handle completely invalid/malicious requests
[03:12:38] <doug__> kokut: no
[03:13:21] <Cork> kokut: server side can't know if js will be run or not
[03:13:29] <PurpleBagel> Cork: can't be that uncommon. I remember having issues with tostringing html in jquery many times before. I think they could solve a lot of confusing if they renamed .html() to .innerHTML() and added an .outerHTML() that actually worked the way your method does
[03:13:30] <doug__> kokut: how will you disable my malicious SQL injection exploit exe written in C that sends headers that are exactly the same as a real browser?
[03:14:08] <Cork> kokut: heck even if you could know, you can't even know if it will actually run the code
[03:14:21] <Cork> as they could modify the js in the browser before submitting
[03:14:28] <Cork> *live*
[03:14:46] <doug__> they have infinite power over the client side, you cant put any security there
[03:14:47] <Nasp> Is someonoe submitting sql with js directly from their site?
[03:15:15] <Cork> no, he wants to add data security in js
[03:15:24] <Cork> or rather data security client side
[03:15:38] <Nasp> That makes no sense
[03:15:42] <Cork> exactly
[03:15:44] <Nasp> Also executing SQL statements from clientside?
[03:15:57] <Nasp> Well you could add some security, it just won't do anything
[03:16:03] <Cork> i think more ensuring that the data is sql safe
[03:16:08] <Cork> but... ya...
[03:16:30] <Cork> Nasp: you can add some validation, but it won't add security
[03:16:45] <Nasp> Sure validation and friendly messages
[03:16:54] <Cork> cause the one you want to secure against will just not run it
[03:16:54] <Nasp> But it always have to be validated server side as well
[03:17:06] <Cork> that is exactly what we've explained
[03:17:11] <Nasp> There's actually still a lot of sites that does this
[03:17:18] <Nasp> Disable javascript and you can bypass a lot
[03:17:18] <doug__> you don't add security by filtering out scary characters, you do it by handling absolutely any characters, by escaping properly and using prepared queries
[03:17:33] <Cork> and there is still lots of sites that gets exploited cause of it
[03:17:41] <Cork> (i did it to a bank a few months back :/)
[03:17:55] <Cork> doug__: no, you can't
[03:18:01] <Nasp> Sure im thinking of using it when i need to order tv package
[03:18:02] <Cork> as security would mean it secures the data
[03:18:16] <Cork> and if the user can choose not to run the code it can't add security
[03:18:20] <Nasp> I could remove an extra forced subscription service by just removing js
[03:19:56] <doug__> Cork: can't what
[03:20:01] <doug__> oh
[03:20:02] <doug__> nvm
[03:21:47] <doug__> it's shocking how much code out there just concatenates together strings of html/sql/whatever with no regard for escaping or security
[03:22:05] <Cork> ya
[03:33:39] <Nasp> It's not as bad as it used to
[03:33:45] <Nasp> SQL injection isn't much heard of these days
[03:34:07] <Cork> heh, i guess you aren't reading drupal/wordpress reports then
[03:35:11] <kokut> is jquery validate supported in different languages?
[03:35:55] <Cork> uh, it's js...
[03:36:06] <Cork> its for graphically showing validation messages
[03:36:16] <Cork> you want something else to actually validate it server side
[03:36:34] <kokut> nvm found it
[03:43:41] <al-damiri> Hi #jquery.
[03:44:13] <al-damiri> I have a line of code: $.post(url, $.param(data)).success(successCb).
[03:44:34] <al-damiri> I cannot find in the document from where this .success() function comes?
[03:44:43] <al-damiri> What does $.post return?
[03:45:14] <kokut> just a lil question, should i include the scripts at the header or at the footer?
[03:54:43] <Bjerre> Kartagis: Don't really want to highlight your name since there might be others here who can solve this and I don't want to disturb you if you're busy, but since you solved the previous one regarding how to disable the buttons after you've clicked one of them, do you know if and how I can combine it with arrow left and right as well? http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/bot0o9dx/6/
[03:55:27] <Kartagis> Bjerre: you must be mistaken, I didn't solve that one
[03:55:48] <Bjerre> oh it was Uhkis
[03:55:57] <Bjerre> sorry Kartagis
[03:56:04] <Kartagis> np at all
[03:57:01] <Bjerre> and sorry Uhkis for not remembering it was you :) I should add your names in the code so others can see who's been working on it
[04:13:26] <Bjerre> I think I solved it http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/bot0o9dx/7/
[04:14:58] <Bjerre> - the disable
[04:17:00] <Bjerre> Cork: sorry for highlight but did you have knowledge of transform in css?
[04:17:14] <Bjerre> or was it jquery you were talking about?
[04:17:44] <al-damiri> How can I reset the state (validity) of an input?
[04:17:49] <Bjerre> curious if it's possible to use transform with translate on background-position
[04:17:52] <Bjerre> can't find anything about it
[04:18:12] <al-damiri> I have submitted a form (with $.ajax) and after submission want to clear the <input /> elements.
[04:18:33] <Bjerre> so you want to clear the string value al-damiri ?
[04:18:45] <al-damiri> If I only do $('input').val('') the, elements are still in invalid state.
[04:18:53] <Bjerre> ah
[04:18:57] <al-damiri> Bjerre: Yes.
[04:19:09] <al-damiri> Bjerre: So my :invalid CSS still shows it highlighted etc.
[04:19:34] <Bjerre> hmm
[04:19:34] <surial> Is there a jq hook, like .hover(), but for a textarea/input element having the cursor in it?
[04:19:43] <surial> something like .focus perhaps?
[04:20:24] <surial> Do I mix .on('focusin') and .on('focusout')?
[04:21:01] <Bjerre> I'm not sure al-damiri on how to solve that
[04:21:08] <Bjerre> when it comes to css
[04:21:38] <al-damiri> Bjerre: I see. No problem.
[04:21:53] <al-damiri> Bjerre: But I think this isn't something to do with CSS.
[04:21:57] <Bjerre> surial: use .mouseover
[04:22:08] <al-damiri> No?
[04:22:09] <surial> Bjerre: that's not focus.
[04:22:13] <Bjerre> ye something has to toggle it with jquery to go back as normal state again
[04:22:28] <Bjerre> well focus is using tab index from what I have experienced
[04:22:57] <surial> Bjerre: I want some javascript to run when a textarea becomes active, and some other javascript to run when the textarea is no longer active, be it because the user clicked elsewhere in the page, or on another element, or because the user tabbed to another input element, or any other reason.
[04:22:58] <Bjerre> or perhaps it can work with that as well
[04:25:16] <Bjerre> so it should run when you toggle the textarea or when you hover over it surial ?
[04:51:22] <delboy1978uk> hi guys, i have a $.post event. im throwing a 500 response but .fail() doesnt seem to trigger?
[04:52:16] <delboy1978uk> does .fail() only work with get?
[04:55:49] <hellyeah> hey there
[05:00:20] <NoodleBlob> Hi. I've got a html string like  '<img src="a.jpg"><h1>b</h1><img src="c.jpg">' and I wanna parse it to jquery and select the image elements only. I thought I could just do '$(htmlString).find("img") ' but nope
[05:05:54] <NoodleBlob> oh figured it out. gotta do     $("div").html('<img src="a.jpg"><h1>b</h1><img src="c.jpg">').find("img")
[05:10:50] <delboy1978uk> NoodleBlob: that will replace all divs content surely?
[05:13:31] <NoodleBlob> delboy1978uk: div was just a temp element I used cause I had to have a parent element to parse that html to so that the find operation would work
[05:13:45] <decx> find doesnt work because the images are in a flat structure
[05:13:55] <decx> meaning jquery interprets it as a collection
[05:14:00] <decx> so you would have to use filter instead
[05:14:15] <NoodleBlob> NoodleBlob : no wait. ah now I get what you mean...$("div") selects all divs..silly me
[05:14:29] <decx> use $(htmlstring).filter('img')
[05:14:35] <decx> that'll do
[05:14:48] <decx> or create that tmp div
[05:14:53] <decx> doesnt really matter
[05:15:46] <NoodleBlob> decx: nope, this will return an empty array         $('<img src="a.jpg"><h1>b</h1><img src="c.jpg">').find("img")
[05:15:56] <decx> reading
[05:15:58] <decx> do you do it?
[05:15:59] <decx> ^^
[05:16:18] <JDHawke> Happy Friday Morning everyone.  I'm having a bit of a conceptual issue with the show/hide commands and working out how to possibly get them to trigger a custom event....
[05:16:19] <JDHawke> http://pastebin.com/iqNxdndp
[05:16:30] <decx> to jquery '<img src="a.jpg"><h1>b</h1><img src="c.jpg">' is a collection of 3 items, an img, a h1 and another img
[05:16:48] <decx> and you filter collections
[05:16:55] <decx> as described above
[05:17:03] <JDHawke> I'm using that to remap the functions, but when it triggers it looks like its ending up in an infinite loop
[05:17:20] <NoodleBlob> decx: lol, I'm so tired that I just read the 'f' in your
[05:17:32] <NoodleBlob> 'filter' and somehow saw the word 'find'
[05:17:44] <NoodleBlob> sorry. and thanks for the help
[05:18:07] <decx> no worries
[05:20:27] <decx> instead of trying to extend core functions just trigger your event when you show/hide
[05:20:34] <decx> ^ JDHawke
[05:21:08] <JDHawke> I would, but it's being triggered from a third party library, I am loath to hack something I don't control the upgrades on
[05:21:39] <decx> in these cases i have a good tip
[05:21:48] <decx> i strap myself into a cannon and shoot to the moon
[05:21:53] <JDHawke> LOL
[05:22:23] <hellyeah> i dont know anything about jquery
[05:22:46] <hellyeah> can you suggest me book or tutorial for reading?
[05:23:56] <decx> http://try.jquery.com/
[05:24:06] <decx> best intro
[05:26:14] <hellyeah> good
[05:26:31] <hellyeah> when i finish that what will i need next?
[05:26:55] <decx> you think of something you want to build and start
[05:28:25] <hellyeah> no actually i just want to learn but after finishing this intro the thing i have to do is writing code.
[05:28:38] <decx> trust me
[05:28:42] <decx> you'll learn
[05:28:59] <decx> building stuff is what it's all about
[05:29:05] <decx> don't get lost the theory
[05:29:41] <hellyeah> actually let me tell you my ideas
[05:30:22] <hellyeah> i have several records on my table and when user click spesific key button like 1,2 i want to select spesific records and show it on the pop up boxes
[05:30:31] <hellyeah> is it possible to do that with jquery
[05:30:36] <hellyeah> ofc it is
[05:30:46] <decx> go through the try page
[05:30:47] <hellyeah> do you understand my intension?
[05:30:50] <decx> that's pretty basic stuff
[05:30:56] <decx> you'll be able to do it
[05:31:09] <hellyeah> after finishing into?
[05:31:32] <decx> we'll still be here should you still have questions afterwards
[05:33:10] <hellyeah> probably i will have some question
[05:34:57] <hellyeah> decx:  my another idea is to make box something like that. My table has some records. They have color according to some situtation. If my records has red color i will write a message to box. This address ha s some problem you should check. This box will be in right corner of browswer and box is cleared after certain amount of message. Is it basic stuff?
[05:35:16] <hellyeah> hope you understand
[05:35:56] <decx> yes, yes
[05:36:42] <hellyeah> ic
[05:36:47] <hellyeah> and last one
[05:37:21] <hassoon> i just can't figure out how to pass a plugin like tablesorter or datepicker to the ajax call
[05:37:40] <hassoon> so i thin of using jquery with css-attributes change to manage a dynamic page
[05:37:41] <hassoon> :/
[05:37:47] <hellyeah> hassoon:  you are everywhere man
[05:38:11] <hassoon> hellyeah: yep
[05:38:17] * hassoon surrounds hellyeah 
[05:38:21] <hassoon> BOOOOO
[05:38:47] <hellyeah> decx:  http://jsfiddle.net/ar6kxkfd/
[05:39:09] <hellyeah> i did that by taking a lot of help
[05:39:15] <hellyeah> i need to understand this totally
[05:39:21] <hellyeah> hassoon:  naber
[05:39:30] <decx> go through the try page already
[05:39:41] <hellyeah> yes
[05:39:42] <hellyeah> thanks
[05:39:49] <hellyeah> as you see i have three ideas
[05:39:51] <hellyeah> ehehe
[05:39:54] <hellyeah> full of ideas
[05:39:55] <hellyeah> :p
[05:40:02] <hellyeah> thanks for support
[05:42:04] <kokut> Could anyone take a lil look at this ? http://jsfiddle.net/1b8bvj1z/
[05:53:44] <arup_r> I am trying enable specific dates only.. and using http://keith-wood.name/datepick.html as a plugin.. But it seems the callback is not working.. any idea how to achieve it ? here goes my code : https://github.com/aruprakshit/sampl_admin/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/hotel.js
[05:57:00] <prohobo> kokut: yeah, it's actually undefined
[05:57:06] <prohobo> there is no element like that
[05:57:18] <kokut> prohobo: whats the correct way then?
[05:57:33] <prohobo> THERE IS NO OBJECT THERE
[05:57:48] <kokut> okay man calm down
[05:57:49] <prohobo> I AM TIRED
[05:58:28] <kokut> im sorry to hear man
[05:58:36] <kokut> its friday, take a lil nap
[06:03:27] <prohobo> NO TIME NAP
[06:04:08] <AcidBeard> ?
[06:30:05] <arup_r> If anybody know why is this not working.. pls help me https://forum.jquery.com/topic/keith-wood-plugin-datepicker-not-working-inside-the-ajax-call-done-method
[06:30:46] <AcidBeard> I shall look....but you should put it in JSFiddle
[06:32:51] <arup_r> AcidBeard: pls tell me what data you want
[06:33:02] <arup_r> I never use JsFiddle
[06:33:15] <arup_r> should I give you array of dates?
[06:33:23] <arup_r> Will it help ?
[06:34:18] <AcidBeard> I don't know, do you have any errors in the console?
[06:35:28] <arup_r> no..
[06:35:34] <arup_r> because github.com/aruprakshit/… is outputting data
[06:35:42] <arup_r> https://github.com/aruprakshit/sampl_admin/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/hotel.js#L8
[06:35:55] <arup_r> only the datepicker is not running
[06:37:15] <AcidBeard> Does the code on line 2,3,4 run?
[06:37:52] <chipyy> Hey
[06:38:05] <AcidBeard> Hi, chipyy
[06:38:12] <arup_r> Yes AcidBeard
[06:38:15] <v0lksman> hello all!  I have a couple problems that seem like they shouldn't be.  If anyone can lend some eyes it would be very much appreciated:  http://jsbin.com/jahuqociho/edit?html,js,console,output
[06:38:24] <chipyy> i have question about slider, i will paste code anytime :)
[06:38:35] <arup_r> I can see the calender on input field
[06:38:39] <v0lksman> I can't seem to get .change() to fire on each change and I can't seemt to get the selected option from the select widget
[06:38:57] <delboy1978uk> why wont .fail() work when i get a 500 error response? http://pastie.org/10260109#1
[06:39:21] <v0lksman> delboy1978uk: isn't it .error()?
[06:39:44] <delboy1978uk> that doesnt work eitrher
[06:39:51] <chipyy> http://pastebin.com/0Pr92LGp  , how could i set that if i enter number in input it would change slide bar ?
[06:39:58] <v0lksman> I stand corrected...docs say .fail()
[06:40:37] <delboy1978uk> v0lksman: try $(‘#whatever’).on(‘change’,function(){ //etc });
[06:40:49] <delboy1978uk> are the elements loaded in through ajax?
[06:41:03] <delboy1978uk> if so thats how you deal with it
[06:41:16] <v0lksman> delboy1978uk: ok..I'll try
[06:41:24] <v0lksman> with your issue...is data a function/
[06:41:25] <v0lksman> ?
[06:41:44] <delboy1978uk> no its the response
[06:41:58] <delboy1978uk> sorry, no its the form post vars
[06:41:58] <v0lksman> yeah I believe jquery is expecting a function there
[06:42:06] <arup_r> worked
[06:42:10] <v0lksman> right...
[06:42:16] <v0lksman> sorry...not very clear brained today
[06:42:19] <arup_r> 2 times initialization made it wrong
[06:42:34] <delboy1978uk> .post( ‘’/the/url’, {var: val, othervar: otherval} , function() {})
[06:42:51] <delboy1978uk> usually arg2 is the post vars
[06:43:18] <v0lksman> delboy1978uk: yeah but you don't have a success function
[06:43:36] <delboy1978uk> done replaces success
[06:43:42] <delboy1978uk> fail replaces error
[06:43:54] <delboy1978uk> as far as im aware
[06:44:01] <chipyy> http://pastebin.com/0Pr92LGp <- how could i add to this function, that i can move slide bar with changing input ?
[06:44:27] <v0lksman> done is "second success"
[06:44:35] <AcidBeard> v0lksman: $(select).attr('id', 'country_teir_select');
[06:44:41] <v0lksman> it still expects a function for success I think
[06:44:52] <delboy1978uk> done works anyway, its fail i’m worried about!
[06:44:54] <v0lksman> delboy1978uk: check out the example http://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/
[06:44:55] <AcidBeard> But you bind the onchange to country_select
[06:47:46] <v0lksman> AcidBeard: right on!
[06:48:08] <v0lksman> so now the only other problem is why change isn't firing on change
[06:54:14] <AcidBeard> Fixed it
[07:11:03] <Bjerre> hello guys
[07:11:08] <Bjerre> decx: your fix was awesome btw
[07:11:20] <AcidBeard> Hello
[07:11:32] <Bjerre> zup AcidBeard
[07:11:57] <AcidBeard> Meh, can't decide if I want to work on stuff for money or fun
[07:12:28] <Bjerre> you got two different projects or are you saying that you will do it for free? :o
[07:13:22] <Bjerre> and if so, how big is that project?
[07:17:26] <AcidBeard> Two projects
[07:17:41] <AcidBeard> One is just tweaks and bug fixes
[07:17:48] <AcidBeard> (that's tha paid one)
[07:17:56] <AcidBeard> The other is a web RPG engine I am making
[07:18:44] <zagaza> hi guys.. when you trigger the collapsible the menu items come from opacity 0 to opacity 1.. but if you re-trigger that collapsible they are still opacity 1.. how could I make it give them opacity 0 again once you retrigger that collapsible? http://jsfiddle.net/p1m1wo95/
[07:18:51] <zagaza> once you close I mean
[07:20:40] <Bjerre> AcidBeard: that second one sounds reaaaaaally fun
[07:20:54] <AcidBeard> I am having a lot of fun with it XD
[07:21:03] <AcidBeard> Hence my predicament
[07:21:09] <Bjerre> if you need sound I can help out :)
[07:21:16] <Bjerre> got bachelors degree in sound designing
[07:21:44] <Bjerre> but no jobs out there and I like doing it for free
[07:21:59] <AcidBeard> zagaza: just set the opacidty to 0 when you hide the div
[07:22:17] <AcidBeard> Awseome...I hadn't even considered sound
[07:22:32] <Bjerre> well since it's an engine I guess you won't add the sounds until later
[07:22:58] <zagaza> AcidBeard.. that works buggy when I try
[07:23:14] <AcidBeard> Yeah, here it is so far, I got a long way to go XD  rpgsys.aramisblack.com/
[07:25:44] <Bjerre> AcidBeard: that is awesome
[07:25:50] <Bjerre> really cool
[07:26:12] <AcidBeard> Thanks.  :P
[07:26:19] <Bjerre> where did the maps save? locally or on the host?
[07:26:29] <AcidBeard> MySQL
[07:26:33] <Bjerre> I accidently created 2 maps
[07:26:34] <Bjerre> ah ok
[07:26:40] <AcidBeard> It's fine
[07:26:53] <Bjerre> that's really cool mate
[07:27:21] <AcidBeard> zagaza: http://jsfiddle.net/p1m1wo95/1/
[07:28:07] <zagaza> AcidBeard if you spam that trigger button a few times fast some of them still got opacity:1 I mean
[07:28:40] <Bjerre> you should have something that animates it backwards
[07:28:49] <Bjerre> easy with css I believe
[07:28:55] <Bjerre> never used jquery for things like that
[07:29:23] <Bjerre> and set timeout on the button between the animation
[07:32:50] <Bjerre> zagaza: take a look at a similar situation I had http://jsfiddle.net/Bjerre/430o0mmb/56/
[07:33:24] <Bjerre> maybe you can take some code of that and implement it in yours. It has a button disable that is set with the same value as the animation time
[07:34:53] <zagaza> cool Bjerre gonna check
[07:35:52] <Bjerre> AcidBeard: have you heard of threejs?
[07:36:08] <AcidBeard> Nope
[07:36:47] <Bjerre> it's more of a 3d environment javascript engine
[07:37:05] <Bjerre> but probably no use in your rpg since it's 2d
[07:37:21] <Bjerre> however, they have some great collision examples
[07:38:04] <decx> what kind of collision?
[07:38:32] <Bjerre> https://stemkoski.github.io/Three.js/Collision-Detection.html
[07:38:39] <Bjerre> decx: ^
[07:39:03] <decx> yeah i know threejs
[07:39:12] <decx> i meant for AcidBeard
[07:39:23] <Bjerre> I was thinking of the movement of the player in his rpg
[07:39:33] <Bjerre> that if you go to the house it will be blocking movement
[07:39:36] <decx> a 2d lib will probably be better suited
[07:39:47] <Bjerre> and once open door the blocking is removed
[07:39:48] <decx> matter.js or box2d.js
[07:39:51] <Bjerre> ah ok
[07:40:40] <AcidBeard> I probably should use a canvas for the map instead of divs
[07:40:46] <AcidBeard> But it works
[07:40:55] <Bjerre> it works really well AcidBeard
[07:41:25] <AcidBeard> Barriers will be checked forst client side and then serverside.
[07:41:29] <AcidBeard> first*
[07:41:41] <AcidBeard> If you aren't cheating, you'll never know
[07:41:46] <Bjerre> ah I see
[07:41:47] <decx> divs give you the benefit of sending mouseenter events by themself
[07:41:50] <Bjerre> sounds really complicated
[07:41:51] <decx> but the performance is shit
[07:41:55] <AcidBeard> If you are, your char will jump back to where it should be
[07:46:18] <Bjerre> I lost the link that Uhkis pasted yesterday :/ was a guide about jquery
[07:46:23] <Bjerre> or I think it was him
[07:47:35] <decx> if you want your character to feel alive then you'll need to at least render the char in canvas
[07:47:46] <decx> give it velocity
[07:48:45] <AcidBeard> He moves, doesn't just jump from tile to tile
[07:48:58] <AcidBeard> Did you look at it?
[07:49:05] <AcidBeard> decx I mean
[07:49:36] <decx> yeah but it feels onrails
[07:51:26] <decx> here's a simple'ish example of a character on canvas interacting with html elements http://jsfiddle.net/decx/7V5xJ/
[07:52:47] <AcidBeard> nice.
[07:54:10] <Cyto> hi
[07:54:56] <AcidBeard> Hello
[08:00:14] <bnp> are there any good alternatives for babel?
[08:00:20] <arthurvr> why don’t you want to use babel?
[08:00:27] <bnp> we're on node 0.10
[08:00:38] <arthurvr> then, no there aren’t any really good ones.
[08:00:43] <arthurvr> just update to node 0.12
[08:00:57] <bnp> we can't update more than 30 production servers
[08:00:59] <arthurvr> why?
[08:01:16] <arthurvr> that was quick :p
[08:02:12] <Enissay> Is there a way to read text then replace it with soemthing else in the same line instead of parsing the dom again to replace it ?  something like : "table.find('tr:first > th:first .stats span').text(CompletedBadgesCounter).parent().text().text( this.replace(/badge/g, 'badgez') );"  where "this" is the read value from that node
[08:03:28] <decx> text(function(i,text){ return text.doStuff() })
[08:03:56] <arthurvr> yep just use the callback arg
[08:04:13] <arthurvr> suprisingly not many people know about this kind of things :/
[08:05:19] <decx> the other day i tried for like 10 minutes to use it with data() before realizing that data will just reference the function and not return something in it ^^
[08:07:12] <qsdqs> hey here I'm having troubles setting up intern to run my tests. Is somebody here experienced with it?
[08:07:37] <arthurvr> qsdqs: how is this jQuery related? anyways yes I have some experience.
[08:09:50] <qsdqs> what did you think about it arthurvr?
[08:09:55] <arthurvr> liked it
[08:11:08] <Bjerre> think about what?
[08:11:30] <arthurvr> Bjerre: intern lol
[08:12:04] <arthurvr> Bjerre: it’s pretty cool  => https://github.com/theintern/intern
[08:12:14] <sk0al> is it possible to create part of the key value in an array using a variable? like var $baseImages = { Top + $options['xxx'] + image: 'images/imagename.png } ?
[08:12:57] <Bjerre> I was like what are they talking about? Setting up an intern... sounds like how to set up a prisoner running your tests.
[08:13:05] <qsdqs> ha i just saw that snover is here haha
[08:13:13] <arthurvr> qsdqs: haha yep :p
[08:13:18] <arthurvr> Bjerre: haha :D
[08:14:16] <Uhkis> Bjerre: yeah, that's the joke ;-)
[08:14:27] <Bjerre> ye I guess so
[08:14:29] <Bjerre> :E
[08:15:00] <qsdqs> arthurvr: no worries! figured it out!
[08:15:07] <qsdqs> couldn't get it to run in ci
[08:15:20] <arthurvr>  glad to hear that
[08:15:29] <Bjerre> I have no idea on how to set up things like that. Do I need to run it on serverside or can I add a local folder to it arthurvr
[08:15:48] <decx> sk0al: do $baseImages['your dynamic key'] = 'stuff'
[08:16:03] <arthurvr> Bjerre: happy to explain it but kinda need to leave, check http://theintern.github.io/ :p
[08:16:14] <sk0al> decx: ok let me try it that route instead
[08:16:14] <Bjerre> ok arthurvr have a great day! :)
[08:16:24] <sk0al> thank you
[08:17:30] <Bjerre> alcohol, anyone?
[08:18:32] <androoid> nope
[08:19:13] <Bjerre> bb later, cya guys!
[08:23:03] <Enissay> decx, arthurvr, thks guyz <3 ... sorry for being a noob, I use JS occasionally for scripting xD
[08:34:05] <arthurvr> Enissay: no problems!

[09:03:51] <sudomarize>  can i get a hand getting typehead working? For some reason when the number of results returned by a remote json call are < 5, typehead doesn't properly show these in its dropdown, even though

[09:04:28] <mdev> graph check browser console for errors also inspect to watch the network requests
[09:04:42] <mdev> see if it's sending the request each time, as it may be server side issue
[09:04:54] <mdev> I recommend debugging with chrome
[09:05:10] <mdev> personally, firefox and others are annoying/harder to use compared to chrome
[09:05:14] <mdev> for debugging and ingeneral
[09:05:59] <Uhkis> firefox has way superior tools for debugging
[09:06:35] <mdev> maybe, but at what cost?
[09:06:39] <Uhkis> (at least with firebug)
[09:06:42] <hydraidm801> I wonder how the debugging will be after the rust parallel processing is finished for FF
[09:06:44] <mdev> chrome inspect is super easy
[09:06:50] <mdev> and is based on firebug I believe
[09:11:28] <robertmaxrees> they're all technically based on firebug fwiw
[09:11:37] <robertmaxrees> and i personally prefer the ff dev tools.

[09:13:44] <mdev> wut
[09:20:28] <sudomarize> i'm trying to use typehead.js, but im getting some strange behaviour
[09:20:38] <robertmaxrees> any console errors or anything?
[09:21:39] <abdc> hey
[09:21:45] <sudomarize> robertmaxrees: not a single one. So if my rest api returns 1 - 2 results, they show up fine. If it returns 3, then only (the first) 2 results are shown. If it returns 4, only (the first) one result is shown. If it returns 5 results, none are shown. And if it returns >5 results, then they all show
[09:21:52] <graphettion> Can someone help me out with a jquery plugin - intro.js. I'm trying to change the tooltip position on one of the steps. Any ideas? - http://jsfiddle.net/urccLq2u/1/
[09:22:06] <robertmaxrees> sudomarize yeah, no clue then.  hard for me to help without seeing it.
[09:22:15] <robertmaxrees> make sure your data is properly formatted maybe?
[09:22:29] <mdev> grap maybe post on stackoverflow
[09:22:38] <mdev> graph rather
[09:22:54] <graphettion> kk
[09:23:07] <ganeshaditya1> guys so I am creating a blog and it has a home page where all the blog posts are listed. Each blogpost has a CNO associated with it. Now I want to add a upvote/downvote feature for each blog posts. To record upvotes/downvotes in my db I need the cno,
[09:23:07] <EminenceHC> Does the operator != apply to blank values? For instance if a value of a select is blank, will that fall in the category of not equal to?
[09:23:26] <robertmaxrees> graphettion so wait what's the issue?
[09:23:34] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC huh?
[09:23:44] <ganeshaditya1> How can I associate a event handler with each upvote downvote button and pass it the cno of the post that it is part of.
[09:23:57] <graphettion> robertmaxrees: I want the position changed on only one data-step.
[09:24:29] <graphettion> Default is showing on the bottom. My first sample shows it on the right on all of them.
[09:24:38] <sudomarize> robertmaxrees: here's my code: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b59e80bba36069050140
[09:24:38] <graphettion> My second was an attempt to make it show on one.
[09:24:54] <EminenceHC>  robertmaxrees:   if ($("select#drug").val() != "2") { $('#drug-desc').hide(); }   If a select field is blank when the page loads, will that command hide it?
[09:24:54] <mdev> https://learn.jquery.com/events/handling-events/
[09:25:14] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC yep.
[09:25:31] <robertmaxrees> also, don't prepend ID selectors with tagnames.
[09:25:35] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: That is what I figured, but it doesnt seem to work unless there is a value.
[09:25:46] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: Ok I will leave off the select
[09:25:53] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC try a console.log($('#drug').val());
[09:25:54] <ganeshaditya1> @mdev I know how to attach event handlers to buttons. But how to pass those even handlers parameters!
[09:26:05] <sudomarize> robertmaxrees: if you replace the returned $.map in remote.filter with [{cat: "first value"}, {cat: "second value"}, {cat: "third value"}] and then use the dropdown, it will only return those first two
[09:26:06] <robertmaxrees> ganeshaditya1 you don't - you'd have to read from the element.
[09:26:15] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC also - you should really use CSS for this instead.
[09:26:22] <mdev> pass to the callback
[09:26:38] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: It is for a dynamic form, I am not sure how I could achieve this in css.
[09:26:39] <ganeshaditya1> @robertmaxrees where can I store cno on the button? On the id ?
[09:26:49] <robertmaxrees> ganeshaditya1 a data attribute.
[09:26:54] <robertmaxrees> data-cno="whatever"
[09:27:01] <robertmaxrees> then access it by using $(this).data('cno')
[09:27:05] <ganeshaditya1> ohhhhoooooo
[09:27:18] <ganeshaditya1> wow that's convinient!
[09:27:46] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:28:04] <ganeshaditya1> Thanks man :)
[09:29:18] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: Oh it got logged as having a value of "1" because there are multiple select fields with the same name. I think I need to use tree traversal.
[09:29:32] <robertmaxrees> EminenceHC wait
[09:29:36] <robertmaxrees> are you using the same id more than once?
[09:30:06] <mdev> ^ don't do that one, for repeats use class names
[09:30:08] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: Doh, yes I am, I will try class. I was using a name selector.
[09:30:15] <robertmaxrees> "name selector"?
[09:30:16] <mdev> id needs to always be unique, always
[09:30:29] <robertmaxrees> and yeah, use a class.
[09:31:14] <EminenceHC> robertmaxrees: I was using $("select[name*='[drug]']") but there are multiple different types of fields with [drug] in the name including the field I want to hide, so I put an id on it instead. I will try with class.
[09:32:17] <mdev> I am hoping your site is legit
[09:33:03] <mdev> guy who ran silkroad just got life in prison
[09:33:29] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing it's some kind of questionnaire
[09:33:53] <mdev> yeah idk, it's none of my business what his site is about, i'm just saying I hope it's legit
[09:33:56] <ganeshaditya1> @mdev it could be a pharmacy site :P
[09:34:03] <mdev> yeah true :)
[09:34:06] <robertmaxrees> welp
[09:34:25] <EminenceHC> Haha me? Its for a healthcare application.
[09:34:36] <EminenceHC> substance abuse
[09:34:39] <ganeshaditya1> Hahah :D
[09:34:45] <mdev> nice :D
[09:34:51] <EminenceHC> not substance abuse like i abuse substances ;)
[09:35:13] <mdev> heh
[09:39:06] <decx> isn't that a marilyn manson song?
[09:42:21] <ganeshaditya1> Hey most of the browsers support data-attribute right @robertmaxrees
[09:43:07] <ganeshaditya1> Like I couldn't find anywhere about android/ms/iOS browsers
[09:43:11] <groenroos> @ganeshaditya1 97.15% globally
[09:43:22] <groenroos> http://caniuse.com/#feat=dataset
[09:43:57] <ganeshaditya1> ohh! what does partially supported mean @groenroos?
[09:44:20] <decx> isn't it quite literal?
[09:44:52] <robertmaxrees> ganeshaditya1 they do.
[09:45:28] <ganeshaditya1> @decx well ... I wanted to know what could be left out in partial support!
[09:45:43] <robertmaxrees> ganeshaditya1 nothing you need to worry about if you're using jquery.
[09:45:57] <ganeshaditya1> ohh okay :)
[09:46:16] <decx> does it build a dataset in cache from attributes regardless of dataset support?
[09:46:40] <robertmaxrees> i think so, but i could be wrong.  it's been a while.
[10:09:47] <graphettion> Posted: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31078527/
[10:10:22] <robertmaxrees> fyi don't put body tags on jsfiddle
[10:15:45] <graphettion> yeah, they are optional
[10:16:04] <graphettion> but makes for non-standard code
[10:16:39] <robertmaxrees> they're not just optional, it tells you to not use them ;)
[10:21:12] <decx> you're confusing things
[10:21:19] <decx> html5 pages are valid without body tags
[10:21:29] <graphettion> I don't see where it says not to use them.
[10:21:31] <decx> jsfiddle already puts everything in the html window inside body tags
[10:22:00] <graphettion> So is <body><body></body></body> complaint code?
[10:22:34] <decx> right
[10:24:58] <robertmaxrees> i thought html5 required body tags
[10:26:40] <decx> no idea
[10:26:49] <decx> i remember reading that it's optional somewhere
[10:26:58] <decx> not like i ever not have them
[10:34:09] <graphettion> Not that big of deal though. I just won't use 'em. :P
[10:35:37] <sudomarize> anyone have experience with typehead.js?
[10:36:10] <robertmaxrees> lots of people do ;)
[10:36:24] <decx> i had but then they changed everything
[11:25:36] <lople> Could someone tell me why this is not working ??
[11:25:36] <lople> $('.upvote').click(upvote_handler); var upvote_handler = function () { 	alert("asd"); }
[11:25:52] <robertmaxrees> does .upvote get added after your code runs?
[11:26:38] <lople> yes it does :O
[11:26:47] <robertmaxrees> use event delegation.
[11:26:53] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[11:27:04] <robertmaxrees> and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[11:27:21] <lople> So all newbies to Jquery make this mistake huh :P
[11:28:18] <robertmaxrees> sorta yeah.
[11:28:47] <glowdemon1>  $.post('includes/ajaxToPhp.php', {type:'registration'}); is there anything wrong with this line on first sight?
[11:29:37] <robertmaxrees> should be fine.
[11:32:59] <mdev> with php do if(isset($_POST['type'])) { now can use $_POST['type']...};
[11:34:51] <lople> @robertmaxress I changed it to $('.upvote').on("click", "a", upvote_handler); function upvote_handler() { 	alert("asd"); } still not working man.
[11:35:00] <robertmaxrees> that's not how that works, lople
[11:35:07] <mdev> you can also echo json_encode($somearray); and jquery side use the returned data directly through the $.post
[11:35:15] <mdev> has a success callback or something
[11:35:23] <robertmaxrees> $('.upvote') doesn't exist at the time of binding - that needs to be a parent element that exists on pageload.
[11:35:44] <mdev> doesn't .on dynamic bind though?
[11:35:48] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:35:55] <mdev> heh
[11:35:59] <mdev> I shall bing this
[11:36:01] <robertmaxrees> lople try $('.someParent').on("click", ".upvote", upvote_handler);, where .someParent is a parent element that exists on pageload.
[11:36:03] <mdev> pretty positive it does
[11:36:06] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:36:12] <lople> okay! Thanks man
[11:36:21] <robertmaxrees> there's a delegated syntax that'll work for dynamically added elements, but it doesn't bind to the new ones at all.
[11:36:49] <robertmaxrees> it relies on event bubbling to work.
[11:36:51] <mdev> google agrees with me apparently
[11:36:57] <mdev> it use to be .live in old jquery
[11:36:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:37:01] <mdev> now on
[11:37:01] <mdev> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1359018/in-jquery-how-to-attach-events-to-dynamic-html-elements
[11:37:02] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:37:12] <robertmaxrees> .live() used event delegation as well undert the hood.
[11:37:39] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/live/ - "This method provides a means to attach delegated event handlers to the document element of a page, which simplifies the use of event handlers when content is dynamically added to a page. See the discussion of direct versus delegated events in the .on() method for more information. "
[11:38:28] <mdev> http://stackoverflow.com/a/24767578
[11:38:32] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:38:36] <robertmaxrees> the documentation is what you want duder.
[11:39:18] <robertmaxrees> and $('body').on('click', 'a.myclass', function() { will work for any element added named a.myclass as a child of body later on/.
[11:39:46] <robertmaxrees> you'll notice that answer convolutes the issue.
[11:39:58] <mdev> that's actually how I detect all clicks
[11:40:03] <mdev> code you just pasted
[11:40:15] <robertmaxrees> that's one way to do it, but you don't need to "refresh" anything.
[11:40:16] <mdev> so i'll be quiet, listen to the robert
[11:40:22] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:41:09] <lople> I am really very tempted to use that body code. But I guess it will slow down things maybe ??
[11:41:20] <robertmaxrees> it's preferable to bind lower than body.
[11:41:24] <lople> Cause the event needs to propagate till the body.
[11:41:34] <robertmaxrees> that won't cause any appreciable performance issues though.
[11:41:50] <lople> okay :)
[11:42:39] <robertmaxrees> in fact, it'd be more of a problem if there are lots of clicks on elements that aren't on the target element since it has to filter each one to see if it matches.  but it's such a small problem that i wouldn't worry about it.
[11:43:55] <lople> Ohhoo
[11:49:29] <lople> @robertmaxrees Hey, is there a difference between ,on("click") and .click() ?
[11:49:57] <lople> I've decided to add my event handlers after the elements are added.
[11:50:04] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[11:50:07] <robertmaxrees> use event delegatiuon.
[11:50:08] <robertmaxrees> trust me.
[11:50:15] <robertmaxrees> and https://api.jquery.com/click/ - "This method is a shortcut for .on( "click", handler )[...]";
[11:50:29] <glowdemon1> http://paste.ofcode.org/32G8jxyXFhMNJcYEcJaky4K need a bit of help here, when I run the php without triggering it from ajax, it will work, but when I call it from ajax, it wont
[11:50:41] <glowdemon1> none of the echos show up when it wont work
[11:50:56] <robertmaxrees> glowdemon1 you need a callback on some kind off the ajax call.
[11:51:10] <robertmaxrees> $.post('includes/ajaxToPhp.php', {type:'registration'}, function(response) {console.log(response)});
[11:51:11] <lople> @robertmaxrees out of curiosity since I am just starting out with Jquery. Can I know why?
[11:51:38] <robertmaxrees> lople because juggling event bindings is a pain in the ass, and you'll have to make sure you don't bind the same listener more than once to an element.
[11:51:53] <BillCriswell> glowdemon1:  add .done(function(response) { console.log(response); });
[11:52:09] <robertmaxrees> it also separates out your code a little better, lople
[11:52:32] <lople> Ohh!! Thanks for the advice!
[11:52:39] <BillCriswell> So like $.pos(url, data).done((function (response) { console.log(response); });
[11:52:49] <robertmaxrees> ^ this'll work, too.
[11:53:42] <BillCriswell> You can also just look at your network pane in devtools.
[11:54:21] <glowdemon1> oh
[11:54:36] <glowdemon1> it does work
[11:55:13] <glowdemon1> Oooooh, now it becomes clear
[12:03:10] <jayjo> is there a way to have an ajax call just post to the current page without knowing the absolute url?
[12:07:03] <robertmaxrees> url: '/' might work
[12:13:36] <edoceo> In jquery-ui autocomplete it seems my focus: and select: handlers don't fire when using the up/down to select the auto-complete list?

[13:07:31] <DarkElement> How can I make a simple overlay that fades in when the page loads and fades out when the user clicks a link?
[13:07:58] <SuperTyp> I use php sessions and redirect user if he is already logged in, but then my custom submit function for the upload form isn't working anymore. I know its because the event is binded before the button is in the DOM but how do I rebind it?
[13:09:08] <lople> @DarkElement did you try a Bootstrap modal forms.. You could customize those I guess
[13:09:39] <DarkElement> lople, haven't tried those. Thanks for the tip!
[13:09:45] <DarkElement> Looking into it right now.
[13:21:00] <robertmt> other than jQuery what tech do you all use to build sites?
[13:21:39] <arthurvr> depends on what the project needs

[13:39:47] <saml> i got an <input>.  how can I add a new one?
[13:40:02] <saml> like... user presses Add button and it adds a new text field
[13:41:42] <e-anima> do you know any good scripts for inline editing of tables
[13:43:07] <arthurvr> saml: yes you can! I’ll make a quick fiddle for you
[13:46:19] <lople> $('what-ever-the-parent-tag-of-the-input-tag-is').append('<input type = "text">);
[13:46:25] <arthurvr> http://jsbin.com/meduzehoko/edit?js,output
[13:46:36] <saml> https://jsbin.com/qiwizu/edit?html,css,js,output   how can I know which Remove button removes which url?
[13:46:40] <arthurvr> lople: creates a new one, mine clones the previous one
[13:46:47] <lople> Dunno if that's the best way to do it
[13:47:12] <saml> i also need to remove existing one. and possibly sort order
[13:47:45] <saml> i think mark up should be smarter
[13:55:24] <pokergod> $.post(.. function(d) {.. } )    d = "{"test":1}"     .. inside the function, d.test is undefined, why is that
[13:56:37] <saml> lople, http://jsfiddle.net/aaki/hMJEy/1/ i googled instead
[13:57:08] <saml> would you use <div>  to group <input><button> pair?
[14:20:32] <hydraidm801> how can I increment currentmonth in ajax? I am stuck https://jsfiddle.net/L02obcf6/
[14:34:30] <hydraidm801> how do I convert a jquery object to a string?
[14:35:05] <hydraidm801> I tried String($.myobject.someint); but that didn't work
[14:38:14] <arthurvr> hydraidm801: what do you expect to get when you convert it to a string? HTML?
[14:38:37] <hydraidm801> I expected a string
[14:39:00] <arthurvr> hydraidm801: how can you covert a dom node to a string? you just want to see the html?
[14:39:46] <hydraidm801> its not a dom node its a jquery object
[14:40:05] <hydraidm801> I use it as a global to increment and decrement the current month
[14:40:21] <arthurvr> so you’d like it to return the text inside of an element?
[14:40:32] <hydraidm801> $.CurrentMonth.m.toString() works
[14:41:21] <hydraidm801> I wanted to cast an int to a string
[14:44:20] <SuperTyp> when I do a php header(Location: "/index.php"); why arent my events binded to the elements?
[14:44:33] <hydraidm801> #php
[14:44:59] <SuperTyp> isn't it a event binding issue?
[14:45:20] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[14:45:34] <robertmaxrees> what does "php header(Location: "/index.php");" do?
[14:47:27] <SuperTyp> a redirect to index.php
[14:47:49] <robertmaxrees> then it should work fine.
[14:47:59] <robertmaxrees> are you sure the page is valid, your JS is running, etc?
[14:48:03] <SuperTyp> the issue is that after I do that, the login form uses the jquery mobile default submit event not the one I actually bind to
[14:48:20] <SuperTyp> robertmaxrees: when I refresh the page it works like a charm
[14:48:22] <robertmaxrees> what happens if you hit the page directly?
[14:48:26] <SuperTyp> it works
[14:48:39] <robertmaxrees> if it's a full server load, then your header code is doing something wrong.
[14:48:43] <robertmaxrees> if it's a full page reload, it should work.
[14:50:31] <SuperTyp> full page load actually but maybe because of jQuery mobile it doesnt change the whole thing
[14:50:46] <robertmaxrees> your server-side code is what's executing that though.
[14:58:13] <SuperTyp> what you mean?
[15:00:23] <robertmaxrees> it's really hard for me to see what's going on, but it's one of two things: 1 - JQM is trying to ajax in part of the page and doesn't actually have all the assets.
[15:00:49] <robertmaxrees> 2 - the redirect isn't actually doing what you think it is.
[15:02:54] <SuperTyp> I think its 2
[15:48:21] <kokut> Hello, i have a lil dropdown that id like to be closed if the client clicks outside of it, is there anything i can use?
[15:48:54] <robertmaxrees> an event listener on 'body' that sees if the clicked element or one of it's parents is in the dropdown.
[16:01:59] <kokut> robertmaxrees: http://codepen.io/TimRuby/pen/kLGic  could you fix it so that when the client clicks outside the dropdown it hides it?
[16:06:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:06:35] <robertmaxrees> i can show you how.
[16:06:39] <robertmaxrees> not going to do it for you ;)
