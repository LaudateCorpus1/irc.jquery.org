[04:02:49] <aarya> hey guys
[04:03:25] <aarya> Do you guys know how to define a Global variable within $.getJSON()
[04:04:22] <aarya> hello is anyone here
[04:04:25] <aarya> ?
[04:05:15] <slax0r> window.myVar = 'foo';
[04:05:35] <slax0r> but when you're dealing with global vars, there's a high probability that you're doing something wrong
[04:15:16] <Cork> aarya: window.<variable> or just do it without var infront
[04:15:40] <Cork> aarya: that said, note that the callback from $.getJSON is called when the network response is returned
[04:15:51] <Cork> so you can't access the variable "after" the call
[04:16:13] <Cork> it has to be async, and "a while later" so the json response has had time to come back
[04:17:47] <lenswipee> Cork: how to set cursor at begining of an input field? From what I searched it's not a straight forward thing.
[04:18:05] <Cork> lenswipee: ya
[04:18:12] <Cork> you have to use the selection api
[04:19:04] <lenswipee> Cork: Selection API?
[04:19:39] <lenswipee> Cork: Is there a Jquery API?
[04:20:11] <Cork> searching for a good reference for you
[04:20:15] <Cork> give me a min
[04:21:14] <Cork> lenswipee: while i'm hunting
[04:21:17] <Cork> what you need is https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLInputElement/setSelectionRange
[04:21:22] <Cork> and https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536401(v=vs.85).aspx
[04:21:40] <Cork> (yes ofcourse ie has a separate api)
[04:21:54] <Cork> ah, here we go
[04:22:10] <lenswipee> Cork: For example, <input type="email">Email</input>
[04:22:11] <Cork> lenswipee: this one is decent http://stackoverflow.com/questions/499126/jquery-set-cursor-position-in-text-area
[04:22:20] <Cork> lenswipee: input doesn't take content
[04:22:34] <Cork> <input type="email" value="Email">
[04:23:48] <lenswipee> Cork: I mean't what you wrote. I'll read the links now especially the jquery one, which I assume will work with IE and Chrome etcc
[04:24:19] <Cork> lenswipee: as long as the helper function supports createTextRange it supports ie
[04:28:09] <lenswipee> Cork: this.setSelectionRange(pos, pos); <-- complains in Chrome, no problem in IE, problem specific for type email...works for type text. what's is going on bro?
[04:28:37] <Cork> lenswipee: setSelectionRange is the web standard method yes
[04:28:47] <Cork> i think edge uses that one too (haven't checked)
[04:30:32] <lenswipee> Crap doesn't work in Chrome
[04:30:56] <Cork> hmm
[04:31:08] <Cork> looks like you're not allowed to move the cursor in email fields O_o'
[04:31:31] <lenswipee> This web dev stuff is nasty business
[04:32:47] <lenswipee> Thought there might be an easier way if I just want to move to start instead of a specific cursor pos
[04:33:50] <lenswipee> i'm guessing clearing the field and focussing would do that :) just a guess
[04:34:19] <Cork> lenswipee: https://developers.whatwg.org/the-input-element.html#input-type-attr-summary
[04:34:28] <Cork> it is according to spec
[04:34:53] <Cork> so... the solution is to change the type to "text" set the caret position
[04:34:56] <Cork> and change it back?
[04:35:47] <lenswipee> solution is to not use type "email" and use "text" instead correct?
[04:36:28] <Cork> you can mod the type change the position and then restore the old type
[04:37:03] <Cork> using type="email" is prob still a good choice cause it affects the keyboard touch devices get
[04:37:41] <lenswipee> lol right. what a hack. thanks Cork
[05:55:28] <xavier_> Hi
[05:57:58] <xavier_> Is there a way to use jquery-ui widgets with dinamically create elements, before appending them? Like $("<button/>").button().appendTo($("body"));
[06:21:50] <d10magic> why undefined in var qtdid ? https://jsfiddle.net/4k57z15j/
[07:28:51] <xavier_> I've made a jqueryui widget that gets an <input type="checkbox"> and returns a <div/> with the element hidden inside and some divs, etc... It works fine when the widget is fired with the element placed in body, but doesn't work if the element is created like $("<input/>").attr('type', 'checkbox'),myWidget().appendTo($("body")); Any sugestions in how to create the object? I've seen that $().button() works because it returns the actual
[07:28:51] <xavier_> element with childs inside, but I need to replace the input element and move into a new div
[08:51:15] <stoned> Hello good morning, I'm trying to understand lazy loading of content but I don't fully grasp the steps
[08:52:23] <stoned> You define an ajax funtion to load content, and you pass in the .css selector to next page, it loads the content for the next page, and appends it to the div of the original content
[08:52:26] <stoned> Is this correct?
[08:53:08] <stoned> The problem is that when the new page loads, it fetches the entire html includin html/head/body tags and not just the content.
[08:53:39] <stoned> Please help me to understand this functionality if you have a chance
[09:25:41] <mad_hatter> I'm having trouble adding a field to a form with w2ui. when I add the html for the field and the actual field to the fields[] array. I get the error. Can't associate 'fieldname' with html control.
[09:25:56] <mad_hatter> Can someone point me to how to go about properly adding a new field to a form
[09:26:44] <Cork> you will prob have to look for a support forum/channel for w2ui (haven't ever heard of it)
[09:30:46] <hellyeah> mad_hatter:  few people on gitter https://gitter.im/mikeromano38/w2ui
[09:30:56] <hellyeah> take a look
[09:31:54] <zsly> Hi! Im trying to create a dropdown form element that toggle another field if "misc" is selected. My function should be reusable within the same form. How can I limit the scope to just one div? https://codepen.io/zeusly/pen/gLPpev?editors=1010
[09:45:53] <lng> Hi! How to limit a scope to a form (I have multiple forms) where checkbox was checked? https://jsfiddle.net/1gfsbe18/2/
[09:47:59] <Cork> lng: https://jsfiddle.net/1gfsbe18/3/
[09:48:09] <AdamPDotty> You shoud work with siblings
[09:48:14] <AdamPDotty> ah, Cork is fast
[09:48:45] <Cork> siblings is an option, but this one will work independent of how you nest the elements
[09:48:51] <AdamPDotty> but still not(this) hints me to siblings
[09:49:22] <Cork> lng: also you want to use <lable> for the text for the checkbox
[09:49:22] <AdamPDotty> anyway would still work, when not(this) is omitted
[09:49:30] <Cork> ya
[09:49:49] <sillyslux> lng https://jsfiddle.net/sillyslux/1gfsbe18/4/
[09:49:56] <lng> $(this).parentsUntil('form').find('input:checkbox').not(this).prop('checked', this.checked);
[09:50:12] <Cork> lng: you want closet
[09:50:12] <lng> thanks guys!
[09:50:25] <Cork> not parentsUntil or parens
[09:50:29] <Cork> *parents
[09:50:32] <lng> Cork: there is table and other stuff
[09:50:45] <Cork> lng: yes, and that is exactly why you want .closet()
[09:50:58] <Cork> parentsUntil will return you all the parents until the form
[09:50:59] <AdamPDotty> You could also go for $('form').on('click', '.check_all', function ...)
[09:51:07] <Cork> .closest() will give you the form
[09:51:14] <Cork> exactly what you're looking for
[09:51:19] <lng> Cork: you are right
[09:51:28] <Cork> and ya, what AdamPDotty just said
[09:51:30] <AdamPDotty> hmm, would not improve much here though
[09:51:34] <lng> cool!
[09:51:40] <lng> I was close though ))
[09:51:48] <lng> thanks!
[09:52:09] <Cork> AdamPDotty: it is prob many more forms then in the example
[09:52:30] <AdamPDotty> maybe they are in a container together *nudge nudge*
[09:52:34] <Cork> so actually you prob don't want to use $('form')
[09:52:40] <Cork> ya
[09:52:59] <Cork> $('common-parent').on('click', '.check_all', function() {})
[09:54:35] <iaj> Hi guys :)
[09:55:14] <iaj> Can someone tell me what I need to do in order to change the "Ich bin Sofortzahler und m√∂chte XYZ sparen" on that fiddle?   https://jsfiddle.net/4r26a5ft/
[09:56:42] <AdamPDotty> type a different text ?
[09:57:44] <iaj> AdamPDotty: huh?  I mean via jQuery?
[09:58:46] <iaj> Sorry, I tried to do $(label).html('something')  or $(label).text('something')  but that got rid of the checkbox as well
[10:02:03] <AdamPDotty> hmm, probably get the two inputs, set them as content of label, then add a span with new text.
[10:04:07] <AdamPDotty> like $('.checkbox).find('label').append(firstInput).append(secondInput).append('<span>Anderer Text</span>')
[10:10:45] <iaj> Hm.. but that wont kill the text right?
[10:11:27] <ingodid> when using sortable, my handle is within a couple wrappers, but only seems to move the most immediate wrapper
[10:11:46] <ingodid> any way to specify the wrapper class other than with the main $('.class').sortable() call?
[10:13:06] <ingodid> code is here: http://kopy.io/YgWw1
[10:14:01] <ingodid> it drags the label, not the .form-group
[10:18:27] <ingodid> nm - got it with the "items" config value
[10:29:13] <iaj> AdamPDotty: Do you also know of a way to replace the text in that case?
[10:38:24] <PCatinean> Hey guys, what sort of plugin is used to construct a image out of multiple small images and use position and z-index to show/hide them?
[10:58:57] <PCatinean> anyone?
[11:17:09] <dglambert> yo
[11:31:49] <sigdk> hello, I 'd like to load data dynamically at my tables upon each tab click: https://jsfiddle.net/pktz456d/5/
[11:33:13] <sigdk> sorry, here 's the fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/pktz456d/6/
[11:33:39] <sigdk> is there anything better I can do instead of that if-else ?
[11:47:10] <mikatone> can do opacity first and width right after using .animate() ?
[12:14:18] <MikeD_> sigdk: why don't you like that if-else ?
[12:19:29] <sigdk> MikeD_, yeah, it's okay... and simple. I was thinking if I could/should use the target var to trigger a $(target).tableRender(); ... or write something like that instead
[12:19:59] <sigdk> target is the tab id (i.e #fooTab) and I'd need a table id (i.e #fooTable)
[12:21:07] <MikeD_> i wouldn't love the render[ foo | bar | etc ] functions cluttering up window scope, but i assumed that's just an example in fiddle
[12:22:42] <MikeD_> how do you know the mapping between content-provider functions and the id of the tabpanel/table.id ?
[12:22:51] <sigdk> MikeD_, hmm, can you elaborate? This is how my code looks more or less
[12:23:45] <sigdk> MikeD_, well, always on fooTab there is a fooTable... by convention
[12:24:09] <sigdk> #fooTab <---> #fooTable
[12:24:39] <MikeD_> so you take in #fooTab and add "le" to the end of it, then select it?
[12:26:14] <MikeD_> we don't see the implementation of those functions, are they mostly the same with a few tweaks?
[12:26:18] <sigdk> MikeD_, well, now I just have that if-else and use a function... I'm not doing any string conversion to the selector... Thats what I thought
[12:27:12] <sigdk> I was wondering if I should go from #fooTab to #fooTable somehow instead of doing this if-else-functioncall
[12:27:26] <MikeD_> it's more DRY to use renderTable() and pass a parameter for how you'd want that flexed
[12:30:15] <sigdk> MikeD_, it' okay, I think I'll stay with that. At least it's clear. Thanks
[12:46:18] <Azitrex> hello guys in jquery this syntax what means about 'g' >> $('#elem', 'g')
[12:46:30] <robertmaxrees> that's a shortcut for "find"
[12:46:46] <robertmaxrees> same as $('g').find('#elem');
[12:46:55] <robertmaxrees> though you should never have a case where you're looking for an ID that way.
[12:47:52] <Azitrex> oh i see --   $('g').find('#elem'); is corrent or $('#elem').find('g'); ?
[12:48:23] <Azitrex> before 'g' was comma not point
[12:48:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:48:36] <robertmaxrees> the former.
[12:48:38] <robertmaxrees> like what I showed you.
[12:48:48] <Azitrex> ok i must be test it
[12:48:50] <Azitrex> thanks
[12:49:08] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery1
[12:49:10] <Azitrex> so what can i to have keyword for that for googling it ?
[12:49:13] <robertmaxrees> it's the "context" here
[12:49:30] <Azitrex> many thanks robert
[13:26:08] <mad_hatter> hello all - im working with datatables at the moment and trying to fix the search feature. I'm doing deferred rendering and the ajax call that makes the call to the backend keeps getting called with every keypress i make into the search box
[13:26:15] <mad_hatter> i have absolutely no clue why this is happening, thoughts?
[13:26:46] <robertmaxrees> is this the native datatables setup or something else?
[13:27:15] <mad_hatter> well ive done some custom stuff for how i want the data to be outputted
[13:27:19] <mad_hatter> i can paste my code if you'd like
[13:27:48] <robertmaxrees> but does the ajax call happen with the original datatables setup?
[13:28:23] <mad_hatter> yeah, i have something like: 'fnServerData': function(sSource, aoData, fnCallback) {
[13:28:29] <mad_hatter> $.ajax() stuff
[13:28:32] <mad_hatter> }
[13:29:05] <robertmaxrees> alright - so datatables is probably firing those requests because that's what it normally does.
[13:31:24] <mad_hatter> but i only want the ajax to fire when i load a new page
[13:31:30] <mad_hatter> because it does incremental loading
[13:31:37] <mad_hatter> i only want to search on what is available on the current page
[13:31:41] <PCatinean> Can someone tell me what library would help me to construct and change and image made out of multiple images?
[13:31:42] <robertmaxrees> s
[13:31:58] <PCatinean> Basically a product that has separate parts as separate images
[13:32:01] <robertmaxrees> *mad_hatter so you actually want a filter for the current result set.
[13:32:06] <PCatinean> using show/hide and z-index to update the final image?
[13:32:16] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean take a look at something like canvas.
[13:32:23] <mad_hatter> robertmaxrees, can you point me to documentation on how to ddo that
[13:32:24] <PCatinean> canvas, that was the one!
[13:32:27] <PCatinean> thanks robertmaxrees :)
[13:32:30] <PCatinean> any other suggestions?
[13:32:35] <robertmaxrees> mad_hatter no clue tbh.  i don't use datatables haha.
[13:32:36] <mad_hatter> also, here is my code: https://jsfiddle.net/63bxf3s1
[13:33:13] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean not really heh.
[13:34:37] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, you think canvas is required for this task btw
[13:34:38] <PCatinean> ?
[13:35:04] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean let me reframe the question - why are you doing that in the first place? :)
[13:41:05] <PCatinean> noo :
[13:41:05] <PCatinean> :(
[13:49:35] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, welcome back
[13:49:50] <PCatinean> What I'm planning to do is to make a web based product configurator for a framework I work in
[13:49:58] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:50:00] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[13:50:15] <PCatinean> And the user can set his attribute "color of x, color of y" and that should change accordingly in the frontend
[13:50:18] <PCatinean> what? :(
[13:50:34] <robertmaxrees> i work in ecommerce with some highly configurable products.
[13:50:41] <robertmaxrees> if you can crack that nut, right on.
[13:51:41] <PCatinean> haha, well that's what I plan to do. The question is how to approach this type of design. I've already implemented the 1 configuration -> 1 image
[13:51:59] <PCatinean> but you need separate images for each configuration instead of one image for each attribute and show/hide accordingly
[13:58:09] <scotepi> How can I have var myRow = $('#row5'); var rowName = myRow.('.name').val();
[13:58:25] <robertmaxrees> you trying to find the .name?
[13:58:29] <scotepi> Basicly, changing the selector
[13:58:38] <robertmaxrees> changing or searching for child elements.
[13:58:39] <scotepi> yes but I don't want to have to know the id
[13:58:47] <robertmaxrees> myRow.find('.name')
[13:58:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:58:54] <scotepi> thanks
[13:59:25] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, do you approach this problem?
[14:00:25] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean not like that haha
[14:00:31] <robertmaxrees> depends on your industry then.
[14:00:33] <robertmaxrees> *though
[14:01:34] <PCatinean> but i'm curious how :D i mean the product should adapt to the changes I gues
[14:01:52] <robertmaxrees> we kept it simple.  doesn't always work terribly well.
[14:02:01] <robertmaxrees> just choose relevant options.
[14:07:15] <PCatinean> still don't know how the visual part is handled
[14:07:53] <robertmaxrees> are you asking to see how we do it?
[14:07:54] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[14:09:07] <robertmaxrees> I'm not saying that this is at all perfect or even good, but we do something like https://www.build.com/emtek-8980/s370539
[14:09:50] * PCatinean looks
[14:10:35] <PCatinean> I see, so no multiple images
[14:11:15] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[14:11:16] <robertmaxrees> not perfect.
[14:11:22] <robertmaxrees> but our users seem to like it.
[14:13:31] <kegster> anyone use a fullpage.js type thing? it works for me but on mobile it jumps to the top, even when destroyed. i figured someone may have a better alternative.
[14:25:15] <z1haze_work> is this valid? http://dpaste.com/01V9T6N
[14:25:28] <z1haze_work> line 2 is what im asking
[14:25:34] <robertmaxrees> the pomoValue?
[14:25:37] <z1haze_work> yea
[14:25:43] <robertmaxrees> that won't do what you think it is.
[14:25:49] <z1haze_work> darn
[14:25:51] <robertmaxrees> $() is always truth.
[14:25:53] <robertmaxrees> *truthy
[14:25:57] <robertmaxrees> even if it doesn't match anything.
[14:26:02] <robertmaxrees> it's just an object with no results.
[14:26:02] <z1haze_work> ah
[14:26:16] <z1haze_work> well shoot
[14:26:30] <z1haze_work> any suggestions?
[14:26:59] <robertmaxrees> those look like they match.
[14:27:04] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[14:27:11] <z1haze_work> different pages, differetn forms
[14:27:11] <robertmaxrees> billing vs cart
[14:27:15] <z1haze_work> yep
[14:27:17] <taplar> maybe get the val() of each
[14:27:29] <robertmaxrees> or promoValue: $('input[name=dwfrm_cart_couponCode]').length ? $('input[name=dwfrm_cart_couponCode]') : $('input[name=dwfrm_billing_couponCode]'),
[14:27:32] <robertmaxrees> ternary.
[14:27:43] <z1haze_work> ah there we go
[14:27:45] <z1haze_work> thanks
[14:27:50] <taplar> ooooor, :D
[14:27:55] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[14:28:04] <taplar> crap, hold on
[14:28:16] <z1haze_work> cant do val() cause i call this method multiple times
[14:28:21] <z1haze_work> well sorry
[14:28:29] <taplar> select both, then eq(0)
[14:28:32] <z1haze_work> i only call this method once, but i use the value multiple times each times they submit the form
[14:28:41] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, here's a good example: http://personnalisable.selleriemae.com/fr/veste-de-concours/10006655-veste-de-concours-dame.html
[14:28:44] <taplar> being lazy right now on the typing
[14:28:50] <PCatinean> seems like they did a custom job there
[14:28:58] <z1haze_work> select both, then eq(0)?
[14:29:01] <taplar> yep
[14:29:16] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean read what i said earlier ;)
[14:29:21] <robertmaxrees> really depends on the industry.
[14:29:28] <taplar> is it possible for both of them to exist?
[14:29:31] <robertmaxrees> i don't always have images for everything.
[14:29:39] <z1haze_work> so like $('input[name=dwfrm_billing_couponCode]', 'input[name=dwfrm_cart_couponCode]').eq(0)?
[14:29:41] <robertmaxrees> z1haze_work why do they have different names?
[14:29:44] <z1haze_work> nope
[14:29:46] <PCatinean> of course not
[14:29:47] <robertmaxrees> why not use a single class and call it a day.
[14:29:57] <taplar> z1haze_work: then no need to do the eq(0) part
[14:29:59] <PCatinean> i'm curious for that particular case
[14:30:05] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean for suits?
[14:30:12] <PCatinean> yeah, for example
[14:30:18] <z1haze_work> that yea makes sense i dunno why i didnt do tha to begin with
[14:30:33] <taplar> to agree with robertmaxrees, we have an in house photo studio because we don't always have pictures
[14:30:49] <z1haze_work> so to clarify, promoValue: $('input[name=dwfrm_cart_couponCode]', 'input[name=dwfrm_billing_couponCode]'), should do just fine?
[14:30:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah we have a studio too buuuut we also have like a million skus or something ridiculous.
[14:30:55] <robertmaxrees> z1haze no.
[14:31:03] <robertmaxrees>  $('input[name=dwfrm_cart_couponCode]',
[14:31:03] <robertmaxrees>  'input[name=dwfrm_billing_couponCode]')
[14:31:11] <robertmaxrees> woops - remove the ','
[14:31:21] <robertmaxrees> replace with just a comma.
[14:31:22] <taplar> oh right, missed that
[14:31:37] <z1haze_work> so dont separate them?
[14:31:50] <taplar> it's like css, your making a logical or
[14:31:55] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:31:56] <robertmaxrees> $('input[name=dwfrm_cart_couponCode], input[name=dwfrm_billing_couponCode]')
[14:32:01] <robertmaxrees> but srs.
[14:32:05] <z1haze_work> ahh both inside same set of ''
[14:32:15] <robertmaxrees> just us a class for those - class="coupon_code"
[14:32:18] <robertmaxrees> then select that class.
[14:32:20] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[14:32:22] <z1haze_work> i know
[14:32:32] <z1haze_work> this isnt my site thought and i dont want to add stuff where i dont have to
[14:32:40] <z1haze_work> im just doing this tiny implementation
[14:32:48] <robertmaxrees> you're adding extra js you don't need to :D
[14:32:54] <z1haze_work> heh
[14:33:00] <z1haze_work> this file was getting changed regardless
[14:33:09] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) jus' sayin'
[14:33:13] <z1haze_work> they like to see minimal files changed in commits i know its weird
[14:33:19] <z1haze_work> but keeps them happy
[14:33:26] <robertmaxrees> terrible metric.
[14:33:41] <z1haze_work> i wont disagree
[14:33:46] <z1haze_work> but its technically code freeze right now
[14:33:57] <z1haze_work> and this business in particular is like 90% online sales
[14:34:09] <z1haze_work> les files changes assumes less regresion testing and less chance of breaking things
[14:34:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:34:18] <z1haze_work> haha
[14:34:28] <robertmaxrees> such a bad assumption.
[14:34:34] <z1haze_work> yea, not mine
[14:39:37] <taplar> hah, that's funny that another company has the concept of a code freeze
[14:39:44] <robertmaxrees> lots of places do.
[14:39:45] <taplar> some reason never thought about that
[14:39:49] <robertmaxrees> and it makes me literally angry
[14:40:12] <taplar> oh?
[14:40:16] <robertmaxrees> yeha.
[14:40:20] <robertmaxrees> there's no reason for them.
[14:40:30] <robertmaxrees> tag your release in -> there's your "freeze"
[14:40:43] <taplar> we can still do fixes during, but no new projects
[14:40:54] <robertmaxrees> issues with that release?  patch against it - don't create a new release out of master.
[14:41:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah we stopp all merges.
[14:41:07] <taplar> ah, well that is bad
[14:41:37] <z1haze_work> robertmaxrees: the reason is that a lot of businesses do 60% of their revenue in a 4-6 week period
[14:41:48] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you realize i work in ecom, right?
[14:41:49] <z1haze_work> they dont want t otake any chances
[14:41:51] <robertmaxrees> :) i know how this stuff works.
[14:41:55] <z1haze_work> bah yea my bad
[14:42:11] <robertmaxrees> our company does quite a bit so i'm way familiar.
[14:42:34] <z1haze_work> i think we're already targetting for january release or something
[14:42:44] <robertmaxrees> we release all the time.
[14:42:55] <robertmaxrees> we're just stopping the train for like a week later this month.
[14:43:07] <z1haze_work> lucky you
[14:43:14] <z1haze_work> i dont know what my places deal is
[14:43:22] <z1haze_work> its like nov1 - jan1
[14:44:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah - eoy stuff
[15:01:33] <sigdk> In this example I somehow need to trigger the rendering of the initial table: https://jsfiddle.net/pktz456d/6/
[15:02:01] <sigdk> *initial tab, the tab I see when the page is loaded
[15:03:06] <taplar> 'rerender' ?
[15:03:09] <sigdk> may I just call renderTableFoo(); inside $(document).ready(function() {
[15:03:35] <sigdk> taplar, it doesn't show when I load the page (the table on the first tab)
[15:03:39] <taplar> you mean toggle visibility?
[15:03:46] <sigdk> yes
[15:03:56] <taplar> add/remove a class that has display: none on it
[15:18:21] <sigdk> taplar, hmm.... I'm not sure I get you. Here's how it looks actually: https://jsfiddle.net/pktz456d/8/  The thing is that to see the first table initially I need to toggle between the tabs
[15:19:35] <robertmaxrees> sigdk notice how you never call either of those functions on pageload?
[15:19:37] <robertmaxrees> only on click?
[15:20:09] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, well, it's not click, it's "on shown"
[15:20:16] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:20:19] <robertmaxrees> when you click on a tab.
[15:20:20] <sigdk> :/
[15:20:21] <robertmaxrees> right?
[15:20:25] <robertmaxrees> same difference.
[15:20:34] <robertmaxrees> you never call either of the renders.
[15:20:37] <robertmaxrees> you gotta call one.
[15:22:27] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[15:22:42] <robertmaxrees> brb
[15:24:44] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, yes. So shall I just call renderTableFoo() or somehow trigger an event?  $("#fooTab").tab("show")  or $("#fooTab").click() didn't work
[15:53:36] <fuze> Can someone please help me with this userscript? I am trying to remove the context menu on youtube videos. https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/6KnXS7Jz/
[15:56:45] <Caspan> curious if there is a better way to do what i am doing. if you go to my site http://bbref.ca/ and type q in the search
[15:57:00] <Caspan> you will see elements hide and then whats left fills in the gaps
[15:57:20] <Caspan> is there a better way to animate these to be a bit smoother
[16:02:29] <Caspan> sorry ment to post in CSS
[16:02:33] <Caspan> meant
[16:05:59] <taplar> i dunno what can be done, but that's a crap ton of data that page is loading
[16:06:10] <Azrael_-> hi
[16:06:20] <taplar> 12.4MB, 24sec load time, :(
[16:07:03] <taplar> and the images are not caching
[16:07:19] <taplar> well, i have my console open so that may be affecting that
[16:07:48] <taplar> ya
[16:11:44] <Azrael_-> i've got an old site with jquery 1.4.2 and looking for a way to provide an overlay feature. can you suggest me an option how to accomplish this?
[16:12:32] <taplar> overlay is mostly done with css
[16:14:02] <taplar> familiar with position and z-index?
[16:14:11] <Azrael_-> only the basics
[16:14:46] <Azrael_-> used mostly the complete addons e.g. jquerytools which solved most of my problems
[16:17:09] <Azrael_-> but it'll probably just get myself some guides/howto and fiddle it together :)
[16:17:13] <Azrael_-> thanks for the hint
[16:18:24] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/80jo86po/
[16:19:01] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/80jo86po/1/
[16:19:01] <Azrael_-> thanks
[16:20:25] <Azrael_-> final target: show an ad on the startpage of a shop for a few seconds and then move it out. or sooner if the user clicks the "close"-button :) but i think i have a start and will get it
[16:20:48] <taplar> in that case i have a suggestion, :D
[16:22:21] <Azrael_-> i appreciate any shortcut
[16:25:02] <iaj> Hi guys
[16:25:31] <iaj> When I want to change the entry of a select box to another option and have it behave the same way as if a user would have changed it, what am I lookingf or?
[16:28:09] <Azrael_-> iaj: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/292615/how-can-i-set-the-value-of-a-dropdownlist-using-jquery imho this should do it
[16:28:20] <iaj> If I just use .val() the change() isnt getting triggered
[16:28:39] <Azrael_-> oh....
[16:29:09] <Azrael_-> the third answer in my link seems to offer a solution
[16:29:39] <iaj> Yeah seems to do the trick :)
[16:29:41] <iaj> One sec!
[16:29:43] <iaj> + thanks :)
[16:29:56] <Azrael_-> yw :)
[16:31:30] <ExeciN> I have some problematic code and I'm trying to make a test-case on jsfiddle. the problem is that even the bits that work on my page, don't work on jsfiddle. https://jsfiddle.net/9uxv9eqg/ can anyone give any inputs?
[16:33:00] <ExeciN> the only thing that doesn't work on my page is the "x" button, clicking on types works and they get cloned under the selected types list
[16:33:24] <taplar> Azrael_-: basic idea of a css driven approach https://jsfiddle.net/acfetxjv/
[16:38:20] <taplar> ExeciN: https://jsfiddle.net/9uxv9eqg/1/  this?
[16:39:43] <taplar> it looks like your attaching the handler to the 'a' elements, and that is also what you are cloning
[16:39:55] <taplar> cloning doesn't carry over bindings through jquery
[16:40:02] <taplar> by default
[16:40:27] <taplar> you're already doing a delegate binding.  i'd say move it slightly higher
[16:41:15] <ExeciN> I used this (on my page) and it worked $("#selected-module-types a").on("click", "button.close", function() {$(this).parent().remove();});
[16:41:32] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/9uxv9eqg/2/
[16:42:00] <ExeciN> pressing the button was removing the actual button, now the 'a' element gets removed. what I don't understand is why it doesn't work on jsfiddle
[16:44:43] <ExeciN> it now works on jsfiddle too. I don't understand why. Maybe my browser hates me
[16:45:49] <taplar> ln 20 i took the 'a' out of the binding
[16:48:51] <taplar> but like i was saying.  if you're delegate binding on (parent child) to target (sub child), but your logic is creating new 'child' for the parent, that doesn't make much sense, from a delegate standpoint
[16:54:17] <ExeciN> I see
[16:58:56] <Azrael_-> taplar: thanks, but here it only works in chrome and ie, not in ff :(
[16:59:12] <taplar> hah, i made it while in ff, :P
[16:59:41] <Azrael_-> very strange
[17:21:58] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
