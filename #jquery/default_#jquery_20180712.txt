[01:35:15] <Rohit_> how to check how much part of my element is visible to screen?
[01:36:49] <Cork> you would have to grab the top, left of the element and its height/width and calculate how much is visible from the viewports scroll and height information
[03:06:03] <ryan_ford> did I not give you a good answer in ##javascript?
[05:24:31] <AdamPDotty> with jQuery('input#BerichtName') I get Object { 0: input#berichtName … with lower case b. Should not it search case sensitive?
[05:25:26] <AdamPDotty> ah without "input" empty result
[05:42:55] * AdamPDotty must be a bug
[05:43:46] <Cork> AdamPDotty: can you make a jsfiddle of the problem?
[05:44:06] <Cork> prefixing an id with a tagname should not change the selection result
[05:44:15] <Cork> (though it is still wasteful)
[06:00:44] <AdamPDotty> http://jsfiddle.net/vbskrndL/1/
[06:00:53] <AdamPDotty> in Safari both results are empty
[06:01:03] <AdamPDotty> in Firefox the second is not
[06:03:45] <konrados> AdamPDotty: - and what happens when you change their order?
[06:03:47] <AdamPDotty> querySelectorAll gives no difference
[06:04:28] <AdamPDotty> then the (now) first delivers a result
[06:05:52] <Cork> interesting... and it is literally jquery doing something... http://jsfiddle.net/vbskrndL/9/
[06:06:21] <Cork> will have to dig into what, cause i can't figure out what it could be at the top of my head...
[06:20:42] <AdamPDotty> The code is in one of our acceptance tests. The test yields a success on production but fails on test system. Can not find the difference.
[06:21:16] <AdamPDotty> Both produce the same output (HTML), both use the same Chrome, both jQuery 2.2.3
[07:13:33] <Cork> AdamPDotty: that is quite interesting... http://jsfiddle.net/vbskrndL/11/
[07:13:43] <Cork> raw sizzle does NOT have the bug...
[07:15:51] <Cork> and $().find() always shows the bug http://jsfiddle.net/vbskrndL/15/
[07:16:37] <preference> Cork: did you see this? https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/8xawer/the_div_that_look_different_in_every_browser/
[07:17:25] <Cork> not that one specifically, but the "problem" is kinda old and known
[07:30:26] <Cork> AdamPDotty: http://jsfiddle.net/vbskrndL/26/
[07:30:45] <Cork> it is a bug in pushStack (the biggest anti-feature in jqeury there is)
[07:32:06] <Cork> AdamPDotty: and my old memleak plugger fixes the bug... http://jsfiddle.net/vbskrndL/28/
[07:32:32] <Cork> ^ that code i use with jquery in production to avoid zombi elements
[07:52:07] <AdamPDotty> Thanks a lot for looking into it!
[07:52:42] <Cork> AdamPDotty: though it prob isn't a solution you want to use
[07:52:59] <Cork> it removes a few jquery function that many use that depends on pushStack
[07:53:22] <AdamPDotty> It started with a wrong selector in our test that for some reason gave success.
[07:53:47] <AdamPDotty> We fix that selector now and remain with the problem, that the test is not reliable.
[07:54:13] <Cork> ya, i would recommend against using case in ids
[07:54:33] <Cork> it is supported by the standard, but it makes the id hard to read in some cases
[10:31:59] <AlexMax> Got a question.  Is it valid for me to use async/await with jQuery deferreds, without modification?
[12:09:16] <ryan_ford> why though? why not use native promises if you're already using es6+ stuff?
[12:14:45] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[12:43:36] <jak2000> robertmaxrees.... wich language programming know for send a file throug sockets(TCP/Winsock)?
[12:46:13] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:46:53] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to send a file via winsock?
[12:49:44] <robertmaxrees> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[12:57:01] <jak2000> yes
[12:57:11] <robertmaxrees> i mean
[12:57:32] <robertmaxrees> there are a few ways.
[12:58:02] <robertmaxrees> though I would ask "why winsock specifically?"
[12:58:05] * robertmaxrees slaps Andr3as around a bit with a large trout
[12:58:12] <robertmaxrees> woops hahahahaha misclick
[12:58:27] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 i would also wonder why you're trying to solve a problem that's been solved before.
[12:59:15] <jak2000> robertmaxrees i have a hardware and only accept files via tcp winsock
[12:59:27] <jak2000> recomend something please any link?
[12:59:39] <robertmaxrees> "via tcp winsock"
[12:59:40] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:00:17] <robertmaxrees> you can use FTP over the network.
[13:00:28] <robertmaxrees> or just share between the two.
[13:00:33] <robertmaxrees> or write batch scripts.
[13:00:56] <jak2000> ok i try with FTP....
[13:04:07] <jak2000> robertmaxrees: know hyperterminal? https://imgur.com/a/3WZ5aWN   see the parameeters....
[13:05:19] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 you're doling out little bits and pieces of info
[13:05:47] <robertmaxrees> from what I can see, none of this is jQuery related.
[13:10:42] <jak2000> understand... with jquery and.or javascrit cant sent a File?
[13:10:50] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:10:57] <robertmaxrees> jquery is a DOM abstraction library.
[13:11:03] <robertmaxrees> and you're askling the wrong question.
[13:11:15] <robertmaxrees> "how do I send files via hyperterminal" <- this is what you're asking.
[13:12:16] <jak2000> no....
[13:12:35] <jak2000> can i send a text ile to a Specific IP/port via TCP/Winsock
[13:12:45] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:12:52] <robertmaxrees> either way - not the right place to ask.
[13:34:11] <WebDragon> so I'm still having a really weird issue with Owl Carousel 2 on the live site that is not affecting devel. I've just duped live back over to dev again, and again issue gone on dev, but present on live. and I've got no explanation for whats causing it
[13:34:39] <WebDragon> basically the owl-carousel wrapper is firing off twice on the instagram gallery and double-wrapping it, but only on the live server.
[13:35:10] <robertmaxrees> gotta link?
[13:35:22] <WebDragon> https://caffegelato.net/ https://devel.caffegelato.net/  (scroll down a bit and you'll see it) .. and sometimes live works fine but on subsequent reload then the problem occurs
[13:35:24] <forgotmynick> Which is correct? Is it console.log( jQuery( '.example' ).height() ); or console.log( jQuery( '.example' ).height );
[13:35:46] <robertmaxrees> forgotmynick http://api.jquery.com/height/
[13:35:49] <robertmaxrees> the former
[13:35:51] <robertmaxrees> .height()
[13:36:17] <WebDragon> so you wind up with itty bitty boxes because each pic in the gallery gets wrapped with its own separate owl-carousel stage (each containing one image)
[13:36:33] <robertmaxrees> WebDragon so you mean the instagram section?
[13:36:43] <WebDragon> yes, robertmaxrees
[13:37:15] <robertmaxrees> where's the js for initializing?
[13:37:19] <WebDragon> if you want, I can take the live site off gulp --production to make tracing the source in the debugger easier
[13:37:24] <WebDragon> half a mo
[13:38:09] <robertmaxrees> though really, my suggestion is to figure out what makes your dev and prod environments different.
[13:38:31] <WebDragon> there, if you CTRL-F5 now, it should reload everything with source maps
[13:38:57] <robertmaxrees> so what makes your prod env different from your dev?
[13:39:00] <WebDragon> robertmaxrees: we recently updated the entire server to a new box with newer PHP but this problem had been present before that.
[13:39:18] <WebDragon> prod and dev are on the same server in the same docroot (www/ and www/devel/ )
[13:39:28] <robertmaxrees> so what about build processes.
[13:39:34] <WebDragon> both using the same PHP ver set by MultiPHP Editor in cpanel
[13:39:44] <robertmaxrees> php isn't going to be your issue here.
[13:39:57] <WebDragon> build process is basically gulp or gulp --production for the Sage theme package in wordpress
[13:40:15] <robertmaxrees> right
[13:40:22] <robertmaxrees> so what's the difference between those two processes?
[13:40:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:40:24] <WebDragon> yeah that much was obvious -- is definitely something in the scripting -- I onyl wanted to clarify that the environments were the same
[13:41:19] <WebDragon> oh :) --production basically removes the sourcemaps and version-strings the filenames and uses an asset.json to identify which file is to be used so the browser will always update without a ctrl-F5
[13:41:31] <WebDragon> but in both cases they are minified
[13:41:59] <WebDragon> devel. is on --production right now, so you could compare the two insofar as source files, in the chrome-debugger
[13:43:17] <WebDragon> robertmaxrees: when I pushed the non --production to live server, here's the file differences from rsync : https://pastebin.com/puhV7kec
[13:43:25] <WebDragon> that should help clarify
[13:43:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:44:01] <robertmaxrees> okay so
[13:44:04] <WebDragon> if I'm not understanding your question correctly, please clarify :)
[13:44:06] <robertmaxrees> i'll help you find the issue.
[13:44:15] <robertmaxrees> but i'm not going to dig around your site's code to figure this out.
[13:45:02] <WebDragon> I'm okay with that -- I'm just having the damnedest time tracking this down on my own. I'm usually pretty good at this, but this one has me utterly stumped
[13:45:41] <WebDragon> I'd appreciate any assistance, even if that involves me rearranging my approach to this
[13:46:18] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:46:22] <robertmaxrees> jQuery(document).ajaxComplete(function(){
[13:46:34] <robertmaxrees> you realize that owlCarousel init will fire any time any ajax completes, right?
[13:47:49] <WebDragon> if that were the cause of the problem, why is it not affecting dev as well? could probably set a breakpoint there and see how many times it hits
[13:48:04] <robertmaxrees> give that a shot.
[13:48:18] <robertmaxrees> my guess is you're hitting a race condition.
[13:49:14] <robertmaxrees> heh https://i.imgur.com/0wctRDK.png
[13:49:21] <WebDragon> hmm possibly.. that still wouldn't explain why it happens in multiple browsers/multiple machines on live, and not at all, ever, on dev
[13:49:33] <robertmaxrees> 2 xhr requests on your live environment.
[13:50:07] <robertmaxrees> and race conditions are weird like that.
[13:50:12] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[13:50:26] <robertmaxrees> that global ajax event handler is a bad idea, regardless.
[13:50:45] <robertmaxrees> all kinds of things can cause that problem.
[13:51:15] <WebDragon> I get the same exact thing on dev (2 xhr requests)
[13:51:32] <robertmaxrees> your code may not be binding in time for the first one.
[13:51:40] <robertmaxrees> hence race condition.
[13:51:57] <robertmaxrees> and regardless, binding a global ajax event listener for that is a bad idea.
[13:52:08] <robertmaxrees> it will likely cause you problems in the future, as well.
[13:52:11] <robertmaxrees> so don't use it :)
[13:52:24] <WebDragon> part of the problem is that I have to wait for the instagram gallery to finish loading before wrapping it with owlcarousel
[13:52:46] <robertmaxrees> how are you loading the gallery then?
[13:52:55] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you need to refactor that.
[13:52:58] <WebDragon> the gallery is being loaded by a wordpress plugin
[13:53:10] <robertmaxrees> what plugin?
[13:53:15] <robertmaxrees> does it offer client-side hooks?
[13:53:18] <WebDragon> and then once the page finalizes and the ajax completes (for that) then i fire off the owlcarousel wrapper
[13:53:31] <WebDragon> https://wordpress.org/plugins/insta-gallery/
[13:54:41] <WebDragon> very simple, and clean. least amount of markup cruft, made it easier to re-wrap things to change from gallery -> carousel without having a carousel plugin that I'd have to defeat half its styles and html before being able to warp it into what I wanted for the design
[13:55:39] <WebDragon> tried a half dozen carousel plugins before hitting on the idea of turning a gallery into a carousel instead of trying to undo half the carousel so it'd look like I wanted
[13:55:54] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[13:55:59] <robertmaxrees> back waaaaaaaaaaaay up
[13:56:11] <WebDragon> okiedoke
[13:56:15] <robertmaxrees> 1. this has its own carousel bundled with it
[13:56:26] <WebDragon> yeap, only it didn't do what I wanted, how I wanted it
[13:56:28] <WebDragon> I tried that
[13:56:37] <WebDragon> see aboe
[13:56:40] <WebDragon> above
[13:56:47] <robertmaxrees> then you don';t want the plugin.
[13:56:49] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:56:53] <WebDragon> you would think
[13:56:59] <WebDragon> I was tempted to write my own
[13:57:00] <robertmaxrees> ...
[13:57:03] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^
[13:57:05] <robertmaxrees> do that.
[13:57:06] <WebDragon> however
[13:57:19] <WebDragon> gallery => carousel worked exactly how i wanted
[13:57:33] <WebDragon> and could use the same owl-carousel wrapper that I use in two other places on that page
[13:58:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:58:35] <robertmaxrees> except it doesn't work the way you want.
[13:58:40] <WebDragon> even if it's a race condition, why is it wrapping the INNER elements of the gallery in addition to the whole gallery
[13:58:44] <robertmaxrees> you're adding extra cruft to the page.
[13:58:50] <WebDragon> well, technically it does. on devel
[13:58:50] <robertmaxrees> because you're reinitializing the gallery.
[13:58:53] <robertmaxrees> full stop.
[13:59:00] <robertmaxrees> that's the problem.
[13:59:04] <robertmaxrees> so fix that problem.
[13:59:29] <WebDragon> I'm downloading a bunch of images to a gallery and telling owl carousel to turn it into a carousel. same as the other two image galleries on the page that are wordpress-generated and not plugin-generated
[13:59:50] <WebDragon> 5 out of 6 galleries have no issue
[14:00:12] <WebDragon> all of them have the LEAST amount of html wrapping them
[14:00:22] <WebDragon> they are as clean as it gets . no cruft
[14:01:17] <WebDragon> and here's the kicker. it worked on live for over a year before this problem suddenly surfaced
[14:01:51] <WebDragon> i've pulled thing down to local dev on my laptop. no problem. I put things in a codepen. no problem.
[14:02:21] <WebDragon> it works everywhere, cleanly, and easily, except this one place
[14:03:05] <robertmaxrees> because that one gallery is the only one wrapped in that ajaxcomplete
[14:03:08] <robertmaxrees> hence the issue.
[14:03:19] <robertmaxrees> you're reinitializing in a global ajax event handler.
[14:03:25] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how else to say this.
[14:03:30] <robertmaxrees> that's literally the entire problem.
[14:03:46] <robertmaxrees> "it works fine on devel" isn't really a good rationale to not fix it.
[14:04:05] <WebDragon> ok so in lieu of replacing the plugin, how would you work around reinitializing the global ajax event handler in order to wait until the gallery loads before firing the carousel wrapper ?
[14:05:17] <robertmaxrees> you don't have a good way to do that.
[14:05:22] <robertmaxrees> which is why i suggest you replace the plugin.
[14:05:35] <robertmaxrees> since you have no way to deterministically figure that out.
[14:05:36] <WebDragon> all of em are gonna load instagram via ajax
[14:06:00] <robertmaxrees> you want one that'll let you hook into that load in the frontend.
[14:06:27] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you could check to see if you've already initialized owl carousel there and then just not on subsequent passes.
[14:06:30] <robertmaxrees> but that's hackyt.
[14:06:40] <WebDragon> so dig into the plugin and see if it has anything I can hook into to fire off the even rather than rely on global ajaxComplete?
[14:06:54] <WebDragon> well that's an option
[14:07:08] <robertmaxrees> but i would seriously just replace the plugin.
[14:07:14] <robertmaxrees> since it's not doing what you want heh
[14:07:35] <WebDragon> the plugin does exactly what i want -- gets a gallery if instagram and gives it to me with the least amount of html wrapping it
[14:07:42] <WebDragon> s/if/of
[14:07:55] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:08:00] <robertmaxrees> except it doesn't.
[14:08:02] <WebDragon> same as the Events
[14:08:06] <WebDragon> same as the Menus
[14:08:18] <WebDragon> wordpress gallery -> carousel
[14:08:26] <WebDragon> simple
[14:08:36] <robertmaxrees> since it's got features you don't need with a lack of frontend functionality
[14:08:55] <robertmaxrees> but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[14:08:56] <WebDragon> there's so few features in the plugin, it's one of the reasons I chose it
[14:09:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:09:01] <WebDragon> less cruft
[14:09:03] <WebDragon> simple
[14:09:07] <robertmaxrees> and it still doesn't do what you want.
[14:09:14] <WebDragon> it does exactly what I want
[14:09:17] <WebDragon> it's not the damn plugin
[14:09:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:09:25] <robertmaxrees> alright duder.
[14:09:58] <WebDragon> it's whats happening AFTER the plugin does its damn job, that I'm having a problem with
[14:10:02] <WebDragon> how is that not obvious?
[14:10:08] <robertmaxrees> because that's not the problem lol
[14:10:13] <WebDragon> it's what *I'M* doing, that's likely causing this
[14:10:17] <WebDragon> you said so yourself
[14:10:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:10:23] <WebDragon> don't use ajaxComplete globally
[14:10:28] <robertmaxrees> right - you'
[14:10:35] <WebDragon> that's stuff I did, not the plugin
[14:10:38] <robertmaxrees> *you're being pushed to use ajaxComplete because the plugin sucks.
[14:10:44] <robertmaxrees> *sucks for your use case.
[14:10:46] <robertmaxrees> but it's alright.
[14:10:56] <robertmaxrees> not a big deal.  just something to consider for the future.
[14:11:02] <WebDragon> no, i simplly took the path of least resistance and stuck with the first thing that did what I wanted without looking further
[14:11:15] <WebDragon> clearly I should have
[14:11:37] <WebDragon> but time constraints and pressure from boss to move on and proof the client, mean you do what you have to
[14:11:47] <robertmaxrees> if you find yourself fighting against a plugin like that, it's likely not the right solution.
[14:12:23] <robertmaxrees> same goes for libs and frameworks, etc.
[14:12:33] <WebDragon> seriously dude, I'm, *telling you* .. out of at least 10 or more plugins I tried workign with, this is the one that fought me the LEAST
[14:12:52] <robertmaxrees> except for the part where it comes with a carousel that you're not using?
[14:12:56] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[14:13:01] <robertmaxrees> it's not a big deal either way.
[14:13:08] <WebDragon> the only way to have lowered the resistance further would be to write my own and I had neither the time nor money to do so
[14:13:08] <robertmaxrees> just something to consider down the road.
[14:13:55] <WebDragon> it's got a few features I don't use. big whoop. most of the other plugins had dozens of features I would never use as well as ludicrous html wrappings on everything
[14:14:17] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:14:20] <robertmaxrees> it's okay duder.
[14:14:24] <WebDragon> totaly serious mang
[14:14:27] <robertmaxrees> not a big deal.
[14:14:28] <WebDragon> :)
[14:14:49] <WebDragon> I'll look into breakpoint checking that ajaxcomplete and see what's happening there
[14:15:10] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:15:12] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:15:16] <robertmaxrees> it's that it's happening twice.
[14:15:25] <WebDragon> I want to know when it happens and why
[14:15:33] <WebDragon> what's causing it to fire the 2nd time
[14:15:36] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/0wctRDK.png
[14:16:24] <WebDragon> yah I saw that. but it NEVER HAPPENS anywhere but the live site. Ive tested four different boxes in opera, chrome, firefox, vivaldi, edge, IE, you name it
[14:16:26] <robertmaxrees> the second is to opentable.
[14:16:35] <robertmaxrees> because it's a race condition.
[14:16:48] <robertmaxrees> things can cause your code to fire in different orders.
[14:17:04] <WebDragon> if it was a race condition there would be the occasional time on the live site where it might get it right
[14:17:08] <WebDragon> and that doesn't happen either
[14:17:17] <robertmaxrees> you said earlier it does.
[14:17:23] <robertmaxrees> right now your code will fire when any ajax call completes.
[14:17:30] <robertmaxrees> regardless of it being to instagram or not.
[14:17:32] <robertmaxrees> which is bad.
[14:17:45] <WebDragon> no I said earlier that the FIRST time you load the page, sometimes it works. at all other occasions it does not work. consistently
[14:17:57] <robertmaxrees> that's still a race condition.
[14:17:59] <WebDragon> most of the time even the first time you load it, it doesn't work
[14:18:07] <robertmaxrees> sounds like when the page is caches, it fails.
[14:18:12] <robertmaxrees> *cached
[14:18:20] <robertmaxrees> so when it'
[14:18:30] <WebDragon> yes I agree, BUT. never happens anywhere else. not dev. not local dev.
[14:18:32] <robertmaxrees> *it's slowed for any reason, it works.
[14:18:41] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* i give up.
[14:18:43] <robertmaxrees> good luck duder.
[14:19:49] <WebDragon> no prob. I'm still gonna dig into it for curiosity sake.
[14:20:07] <WebDragon> appreciate your insight, nonetheless.
[14:20:17] <robertBusy> lmao
[14:20:26] * WebDragon leaves a carafe of DragonCoffee on the counter by way of thanks
[14:20:38] <robertBusy> "i don't have time to actually fix the problem" -> "i have time to dig into this one small problem"
[14:21:38] <WebDragon> I dont have time to redo everything from scratch and either write my own plugin and learn the instagram API and all that crap, nor do I have time to again plow thru and play with 18-dozen different instagram plugins til I find one that works the way i need it to
[14:22:28] <WebDragon> I[m gonna dig for a few minutes on this and then go back to boss with "cannot do" + "need to tell client we need to bill them for the fix"
[14:22:48] <robertBusy> wat
[14:22:52] <robertBusy> i gave you the fix though.
[14:22:52] <WebDragon> seriously wtf man. its like you never scratched a programming itch in your life or something
[14:22:55] <robertBusy> so confused.
[14:22:57] <robertBusy> LOL
[14:23:21] <robertBusy> good luck duder
[14:23:46] <WebDragon> yeahh you did : replace plugin (need to bill client for time and effort finding replacement) or 'dont do ajaxcomplete ' (need to bill client for workaround)
[14:24:15] <WebDragon> not exactly "the fix" there, buddy :)
[14:24:58] <robertBusy> "alternatively, you could check to see if you've already initialized owl carousel there and then just not on subsequent passes."
[14:25:01] <robertBusy> you were saying?
[14:25:03] <WebDragon> while boss dithers with client, i can play in the dev tools sandbox for a while to satisfy my curiosity
[14:25:12] <WebDragon> why is that a problem for you?
[14:25:53] <WebDragon> yeah, I and I responded to that "well, that's an option"
[14:26:08] <WebDragon> you did say it was hacky
[14:26:11] <robertBusy> i don't care, just kind of strange to ask for help, continually argue against advice given, and then be curt with me.
[14:26:33] <WebDragon> that was one of the things I was going to look into when looking into it -- I dont know how that was unclear to you
[14:27:09] <robertBusy> lol
[14:27:11] <WebDragon> not being curt with you, I did say thanks, and that I appreciated your insights. hard to tell from text-only what my expressions are
[14:27:20] <robertBusy> enjoy
[14:27:56] <WebDragon> cheers
[14:27:59] <WebDragon> :)
[14:37:46] <WebDragon> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39446888/meteor-dynamic-page-with-owl-carousel-2-after-refresh-the-page-the-owl-car/42555164 hm
[14:39:06] <robertBusy> do not use timeouts here.
[14:39:13] <robertBusy> timeouts are baaaaaad heh
[15:01:46] <WebDragon> if ( ! $("[id^='instagal-'").hasClass("owl-carousel") ) {  // well that was easy. if it's already been wrapped, don't rewrap it
[15:01:58] <WebDragon> hacky but do-able
[15:02:36] <robertBusy> heh
[15:05:19] <robertBusy> do you plan on having multiples of these btw?
[15:35:46] <WebDragon> multiples of whats
[15:36:16] <WebDragon> (I know I'm gonna hate myself for asking)
[16:00:19] <WebDragon> oh I think I know what he meant, but basically it's just accounting for how the plugin generates its shortcodes -- if I delete this one and create another, it would have a different ID, so I just avoided that problem
[16:07:52] <DB_rando> Hey fellas
[16:08:04] <DB_rando> I'm using this script:
[16:08:12] <DB_rando> https://thepasteb.in/p/76hEKmzNND5IV
[16:08:25] <DB_rando> To add an "active" class to the current menu item when the user is on that specific page
[16:08:30] <DB_rando> BUT
[16:08:37] <DB_rando> I use a lot of anchor links on that page
[16:08:44] <DB_rando> If a user visits through an anchor link, it won't work
[16:09:00] <DB_rando> So even though site.com/page#2 loads the same page, this won't work
[16:09:12] <DB_rando> Obviously I thought of using "if contains url" rather than "if matches url"
[16:09:21] <DB_rando> but some of these have parent/child relationships
[16:09:38] <DB_rando> So site.com/parent/child would highlight both the parent and the child menu items
[16:26:07] <DB_rando> C'mon brehs
[16:27:38] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[16:28:36] <robertmaxrees> oh.,
[16:28:49] <robertmaxrees> you wanna add an active class to the menu item the user is on?
[16:29:22] <robertmaxrees> DB_rando my question to you then is: why not do this server-side?
[16:29:28] <robertmaxrees> brb
[16:42:51] <DB_rando> hey robertmaxres
[16:42:56] <DB_rando> What do you mean server-side?
[16:43:04] <DB_rando> I can do it with php, possibly, but I'm not sure how else
[16:44:17] <robertmaxrees> that's what I mean.
[16:44:21] <robertmaxrees> do it in your php.
[16:44:50] <DB_rando> I'm not sure how :/
[16:45:09] <robertmaxrees> there's an entire ##php :)
[16:46:20] <DB_rando> Fair enough
[16:46:40] <DB_rando> Ahh fugg it requires registration
[16:46:48] <robertmaxrees> then reg!  it's easy :)
[16:53:44] <masterasia> I'm trying to implement a simple pjax implementation
[16:53:53] <masterasia> but pushstate messes up the back-button
[16:54:27] <masterasia> clicking on links currently goes to an endpoint, gets template string, and I'm doing a body.empty() and then appending the new body
[16:54:35] <masterasia> but the back-button is non-functional?
[17:40:04] <SomeT> anyone know of an example in jquery that changes the value of the slider on the DOM/HTML by means of a global variable within the jquery code?
[17:40:38] <robertmaxrees> you mean "change var and have that automatically update the DOM"?
[17:41:27] <robertmaxrees> SomeT
[17:41:43] <SomeT> yeah exactly
[17:41:48] <SomeT> lemme show you my code
[17:41:52] <SomeT> just make sure on same page
[17:41:52] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't exist.
[17:42:07] <robertmaxrees> that's where you get into libraries/frameworks
[17:42:27] <SomeT> https://hastebin.com/besefomore.html
[17:42:32] <SomeT> so on line 146
[17:43:03] <SomeT> I want to change that value of 1000 to a value with the slider on the html in lines 25 to 27
[17:43:23] <SomeT> but when I try and copy examples none of them do the variable out of scope so having some troubles working it out
[17:43:24] <robertmaxrees> with jquery, you'll need to manually target that and update.
[17:43:55] <SomeT> but how?
[17:44:04] <robertmaxrees> $('#myRange').val(newValue);
[17:44:11] <SomeT> https://tutorialzine.com/2011/12/what-you-need-to-know-html5-range-input
[17:44:14] <SomeT> I found this good example
[17:44:31] <SomeT> https://gyazo.com/0acbff08c3dc4e354f0fbb679184fcde
[17:44:34] <SomeT> but on this part
[17:44:47] <SomeT> especially
[17:44:48] <SomeT> currentValue.html(this.value);
[17:44:49] <robertmaxrees> you set it using .val()
[17:44:59] <SomeT> can you show me how in a jsfiddle, pls
[17:45:04] <robertmaxrees> ....
[17:45:09] <robertmaxrees> what about that is ambiguous?
[17:45:13] * SomeT laughs in pain
[17:45:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm serious.
[17:45:32] <SomeT> $('#myRange').val(newValue);
[17:45:41] <SomeT> I don't understand how that will exist out the function
[17:45:44] <robertmaxrees> where newValue is whatever you want to set that value to.
[17:45:45] <SomeT> or what myRange is doing
[17:45:57] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/
[17:45:57] <SomeT> so myrange is the id
[17:46:11] <robertmaxrees> $('#myRange') is a selector - it's selecting the element with that ID.
[17:46:37] <robertmaxrees> .val(newValue) is how we set the value of inputs.  newValue should be changed to whatever you need it to be.
[17:47:43] <SomeT> ok
[17:52:44] <robertmaxrees> make sense SomeT?
[17:55:46] <SomeT> no
[17:55:47] <SomeT> lol
[17:55:48] <SomeT> I am tired
[17:55:52] <SomeT> I might come back tomorrow
[17:56:11] <SomeT> https://jsfiddle.net/SomeT/y1wmcxzt/8/
[17:56:15] <SomeT> I tried here 8 times
[17:56:16] <SomeT> still nothing
[17:56:20] <SomeT> I left it as it is for now
[17:56:41] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:57:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm so confused lol
[17:57:46] <SomeT> that jsfiddle is probably clearer than I explained above tbh
[17:58:07] <SomeT> basically I just need to get that variable sliderValueVar to change according to the slider on the html
[17:58:57] <robertmaxrees> why does it need to be in a var?
[17:59:02] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to do 2-way binding?
[17:59:49] <SomeT> nah I am trying to change something else where I mentioned on line 146 here: https://hastebin.com/besefomore.html
[17:59:57] <SomeT> so that value 1000 I am trying to change using the slider
[18:00:03] <SomeT> so if I can assign it to a global var
[18:00:08] <SomeT> then I can change 1000 to the var name
[18:00:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, no.
[18:00:15] <robertmaxrees> that's not how that works.
[18:00:19] <robertmaxrees> just update tyhe slider directly.
[18:00:24] <SomeT> what do you mean?
[18:00:37] <robertmaxrees> why do you need to update a var?
[18:00:44] <robertmaxrees> why not update the slider directly?
[18:03:35] <robertmaxrees> SomeT are you confused about how you update the slider?
[18:03:53] <SomeT> how can I have the slider code inside another function that does something different
[18:04:01] <SomeT> what you are saying to me makes no sense, sorry
[18:04:06] <SomeT> I thought my method was simple
[18:04:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:04:20] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/y1wmcxzt/13/
[18:04:31] <robertmaxrees> what does this currently not do that you want it to?
[18:04:41] <gambl0re> hello?
[18:04:47] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re over 300 people here
[18:04:53] <robertmaxrees> if you need help, just ask :)
[18:05:34] <SomeT> it does not change the var value
[18:05:34] <robertmaxrees> the issue is your original request isn't possible.
[18:05:38] <SomeT> on line 13
[18:05:40] <SomeT> in the js code
[18:05:41] <robertmaxrees> sliderValueVar ?
[18:05:45] <SomeT> yes
[18:05:54] <robertmaxrees> why do you want that var to update?
[18:06:05] <SomeT> because I need it to update something else further in my code here
[18:06:14] <SomeT> sorry on that ahstebin link I posted
[18:06:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's not a good idea.
[18:07:39] <robertmaxrees> just read/write from the slider directly.
[18:07:46] <robertmaxrees> instead of trying to hold state somewhere else.
[18:08:38] <SomeT> I don't think that is possible
[18:08:47] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:08:47] <robertmaxrees> it is.
[18:08:53] <SomeT> but how...
[18:08:56] <SomeT> its to realtime
[18:09:02] <robertmaxrees> "its to realtime"?
[18:09:18] <robertmaxrees> $('#defaultSlider').val()
[18:09:21] <robertmaxrees> that's how you get the value.
[18:09:59] <SomeT> yes
[18:10:06] <SomeT> one moment
[18:10:23] <robertmaxrees> i don't see why you need to update a random var that's out of scopwe.
[18:10:24] <robertmaxrees> *Scope
[18:14:44] <SomeT> https://hastebin.com/ohavoyimax.html
[18:14:59] <SomeT> lines 25 and 144 for the changes
[18:15:03] <SomeT> I don't think it works as you said
[18:15:22] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:15:32] <SomeT> ?
[18:15:36] * SomeT cries
[18:16:07] <robertmaxrees> i'm blown away that you're using promises, have full error handling, and doing your own templating, but you don't understand the issue here.
[18:16:26] <SomeT> I said I was tired
[18:16:29] <SomeT> I was trying to go
[18:16:33] <SomeT> but you kept engaging me
[18:16:40] <robertmaxrees> (sigh)
[18:16:47] <robertmaxrees> whatevs.
[18:16:51] <robertmaxrees> i give up for the day
[18:17:23] <SomeT> $('#defaultSlider').val()
[18:17:27] <SomeT> you just said put that
[18:17:33] <SomeT> so it makes no sense to me what your getting at
[22:25:17] <ringzer0> So.  Apparently jQuery is "good" at DOM Parsing ... If I had an var/let/const $htmlDocument = <possibly-valid-html> ... And my goal was to "identify" the XPATH or selector wrapping paginated-items (loop-generated-code) ... How would (or could) jQuery help in this case?
