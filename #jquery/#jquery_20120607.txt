[00:05:54] <gkunno> Whirl3d, thanx for the help, but the idea was that the cards flip back after the delay
[00:06:26] <gkunno> but not all at the same time
[00:06:32] <Whirl3d> ko. Gimme just a minute
[00:06:38] <gkunno> so that each card has "its own" delay
[00:08:44] <gkunno> Whirl3d, i also tried to do some work on this, but without success, maybe you could have some help/clues from this one: http://pastebin.com/r9HfsrFJ
[00:09:19] <gkunno> the flip effect works with that, but the animation does not on the "flip-back"
[00:10:33] <gkunno> the delay i mean is working....
[00:16:36] <Whirl3d> I think i found your problem...
[00:16:46] <Whirl3d> you have to use var $this=$(this);
[00:18:02] <gkunno> hmm..
[00:18:05] <gkunno> ok ill try
[00:21:28] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/mDuuZ/26/
[00:21:47] <Whirl3d> weird weird weird...I couldn't get the context of the flipBack to work
[00:22:08] <Whirl3d> I ended up just copying the function to the setTimeout  and it works
[00:23:08] <Whirl3d> sort of...still not quite right
[00:23:20] <gkunno> Whirl3d thanx! ill work on that
[00:23:28] <gkunno> seem to get the delay working
[00:23:51] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/mDuuZ/27/
[00:24:01] <Whirl3d> you were on  the right track...
[00:24:41] <Whirl3d> with the simulated click...otherwise, it would mess up after being clicked the first time (since we flipped it bavck without triggering the toggle)
[00:25:20] <shennyg> I'm trying to turn an grouped object into an array and I'm having trouble. Here is my code: http://jsfiddle.net/VzPNJ/3/ and here is what I am getting out: https://img.skitch.com/20120607-jtt27cse56nqkh5yc8ecucjmk.jpg it looks like a multi dimensional array with objects in them. I'm looking at getting a single array.
[00:28:33] <Whirl3d> groups is an array of 3 objects
[00:29:00] <Whirl3d> eent, performer and venue
[00:29:15] <Whirl3d> each of which has it's own doclist
[00:29:15] <shennyg> yes
[00:29:47] <shennyg> yes, is there an easy way to merge all the docs
[00:29:53] <shennyg> or even doclist's?
[00:29:56] <Whirl3d> event has an array of 5 docs
[00:30:59] <ryanaz> does jquery ui have any nice scrollbars for overflow: auto ?
[00:31:29] <vl1234> hi gud morning
[00:31:32] <shennyg> Whirl3d: yup.
[00:33:24] <vl1234> @Whirl3d............id = name56.........i want to pick that num only.....its possible in jquery
[00:33:56] * BinaryKitten hi5s Whirl3d
[00:34:06] <BinaryKitten> still at the grindstone i see
[00:36:24] <ryanaz> Whirl3d:   scrollbars/autoflow in jquery ui ?
[00:39:49] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/VzPNJ/11/
[00:39:49] <Whirl3d> oh hey all...
[00:39:49] <Whirl3d> shennyg, it's ugly, but it gets the docs all together.
[00:39:49] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten, live for it. LOL
[00:40:16] <Whirl3d> ryanaz, I am not versed in scrollbars/autofdlow in jqueryUI. I can tell you that whenever I have scroll anything, I defer to Ariel Fleischer's scrollto plugin
[00:41:18] <Whirl3d> BinaryKitten, do you have any sort of event delegation model or pub/sub model that you use?
[00:42:15] <Whirl3d> vl11234, yes. But that's only cause it's javascript...I would use regex
[00:43:30] <Whirl3d> var idnum=parseInt(id.replace(/[^0-9]*/ig,""));
[00:43:32] <dgx> Can someone help with this one: http://pastebin.com/y7HNPZ0S I am using it to make a form, where the user must not enter the same value in more than one input field. However currently it doesn't work, as in, the user can enter 2 same values.
[00:43:33] <Whirl3d> maybe?
[00:43:37] <Cork> Whirl3d: he left :)
[00:44:06] <Whirl3d> I should prolly turn back on the leave/enter announcements. LOL
[00:44:14] <Whirl3d> thx 8|
[00:45:24] <grifx> Hello guys
[00:45:45] <Whirl3d> Hello grifx
[00:46:18] <grifx> I use Symfony2. And I want to use Ajax.... it made a json with a list of keywords : [{"name":"j","pageUrl":"http:\/\/dssds.fdf"},{"name":"j","pageUrl":"http:\/\/dssds.fdf"}]
[00:46:23] <grifx> But I can't use it ...
[00:47:23] <Whirl3d> and why is it that you can't use it?
[00:47:42] <grifx> I can't use the json
[00:48:01] <Whirl3d> or you'll get grounded...
[00:48:07] <grifx> An alert with a value of the json doesn't work
[00:48:39] <Whirl3d> are you setting your datatype to json in the ajax params
[00:49:14] <Whirl3d> if you paste our code into a working fiddle, it's the easiest, most thorough way to get help around these parts.
[00:49:43] <grifx> ok
[00:51:49] <sjobidoo> I'm trying to get the files uploaded with in a form with jquery.. but having some issues. Here's my html + javascript: http://jsfiddle.net/84Uu3/1/
[00:52:08] <sjobidoo> The alert only returns :  C:\fakepath\my-first-file.jpg
[00:52:53] <sjobidoo> so if i've choosen multiple files..it still only shows up my first one... Any advice on how i can / if possible, to get the complete $_FILES array (i'm using php)
[00:53:07] <grifx> Whirl3d: http://jsfiddle.net/RFfst/
[00:53:39] <_Fuse_> hi everybody
[00:54:13] <NodeX> When I do $('form').find(":submit"); ... how do I identify if it was a <button>Foo</button> or <input type="submit" /> ... .prop("type"); returns submit for both
[00:55:19] <_Fuse_> I was using jQuery's mouseleave event and came across the problem that it is triggered when the user enters the autocomplete (firefox) dropdown box of an input field inside the div I bound mouseleave to
[00:56:14] <_Fuse_> how should it be? strange problem
[00:58:28] <Whirl3d> grifx, did you try it without DATA param?
[00:59:31] <grifx> Whirl3d: No i'll .
[01:00:22] <Whirl3d> _Fuse_ don't bind mouseleave to that box
[01:01:20] <jobbmon> any idea why width returns an incorrect value for one of my elements? the width is set to 50% in css, and in the inspector it is rendered as 565px, but width returns 438px
[01:01:59] <Whirl3d> margins? box-model?
[01:02:01] <dgx> why does after the validation plugin checks the form once, stops from checking it after the user enters new values?
[01:02:17] <jobbmon> zero margins. default box-model
[01:02:24] <jobbmon> whatever the default is called
[01:03:43] <jobbmon> tried setting the width of the parent explicitly (although it's still the same value as before) and now it worked
[01:03:50] <grifx> How can I see the text value of the data variable when i use .ajax
[01:03:55] <Whirl3d> dgx, that depends entirely on your implementation. When do you call the validate method? You should call it before submit...
[01:04:00] <jobbmon> seems like a bug in jquery :-O
[01:04:25] <Whirl3d> jobbmon, it's prolly a css thing.
[01:04:29] <Whirl3d> not a jquery bug
[01:04:54] <Whirl3d> grifx, the text value of the data object?
[01:06:10] <_Fuse_> Whirl3d: i unbind mouseleave for input but its the same problem (with firefox)
[01:06:18] <jobbmon> Whirl3d, how do you mean exactly? the browser reports the correct width, shouldnt jquery be able to query that?
[01:08:35] <grifx> Whirl3d: yes
[01:08:50] <jobbmon> ill see if i can reproduce it in jsfiddle
[01:08:52] <grifx> When i do an alert, i've Object
[01:09:51] <sjobidoo> nm my question..solved it :)
[01:11:05] <dgx> Whirl3d: I am using this demo: http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/custom-methods-demo.html
[01:11:54] <grifx> [object Object],[object Object]
[01:12:01] <grifx> my alert show that
[01:12:10] <grifx> How can i show the value of object
[01:13:02] <xec> grifx: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide3
[01:14:21] <xinming_> In jquery, Is that possible to do something after the "window" is focused?
[01:14:37] <xinming_> I don't mean the .bind('focus', function ..) thing.
[01:15:03] <xinming_> I read the doc, and there is a comment say that $(window).focus is not working in jquery.
[01:15:03] <xec> grifx: go through and check out especially slide 15/16 ;)
[01:17:16] <tdskate_> Test
[01:20:14] <grifx> Whirl3d: I found a solution. I put a [0] after data. i don't know why i have to ....:     	$.each(data, function() {     		 alert(data[0].pageUrl);     	});
[01:20:46] <granden> Hi, I know of $(this) but is there any similar selector but that choose everyelement but $(this)?
[01:21:18] <granden> $('.AccordionTitle').click(function(){ //Here I would like it });
[01:21:24] <xec> granden: that doesnt sound right? why would you want every *other* element?
[01:21:39] <granden> xec: Because I'm changing the background of $(this) element
[01:21:44] <granden> when it is clicked
[01:21:48] <granden> so when clicking a new element
[01:21:52] <granden> it should remove from the others
[01:21:58] <granden> and default back to another image
[01:22:06] <xec> well you could just remove it from all of them and add it to the current
[01:22:21] <tdskate> Test
[01:22:56] <xec> granden: when you said every element i thought you meant *every element* on the page ;)
[01:23:04] <granden> xec: Ok, thats how I thought I would do it.
[01:23:07] <granden> xec: Oh, sorry
[01:23:16] <granden> but was wondering if there would be any better solution.
[01:24:36] <sasori> why is it that when i type e.g  jQuery.extend(obj1, obj2, obj3); via the firefox console..it throws an error saying "ReferenceError:jQuery is not defined"
[01:24:59] <sasori> how to define jquery via the firefox console, just to be able to test javascript codes?
[01:25:01] <xec> maybe jQuery isn't defined? :D
[01:25:22] <xec> are you sure you included jquery? :P
[01:28:17] <sasori> ok..fixex. thanks XD
[01:33:45] <granden> xec: Thanks!
[01:34:42] <granden> xec: One problem though
[01:35:09] <xec> brb 10mins
[01:35:32] <granden> xec: If I press div1 it gets the new class, but if pressing the same div again, it still have that class but then it should be removed.
[01:35:59] <grifx_> Hi
[01:36:05] <grifx_> http://jsfiddle.net/YbnL7/
[01:36:51] <grifx_> When I do a :alert(data[0].pageUrl);
[01:36:53] <grifx_> it's working
[01:37:21] <grifx_> else, without [0] it show undefine

[01:43:17] <granden> http://pastebin.com/8EhBACwS
[01:43:37] <granden> Got like that, but the class is not selected if $(this) already got it.
[01:43:44] <granden> oh
[01:43:46] <caption> hi
[01:43:46] <granden> though
[01:44:14] <granden> Fixed it.
[01:46:09] <granden> Is there any good page to browse for jquery plugins?
[01:46:55] <xec> granden: move line 1 to line 7
[01:47:04] <xec> oh you fixed it already?
[01:49:50] <caption> what do you mean??
[01:50:45] <caption> what is really jquery is..can any one explain in his own words???
[01:51:04] <xec> caption: it is a javascript library!
[01:51:18] <caption> hm hm..
[01:51:36] <hooloovoo> or a javascript function
[01:51:37] <caption> and then
[01:52:10] <nebmo> I've managed to get lastIndexOf(" ") working, but now the substring doesnt work (http://jsfiddle.net/P9StL/1/) any ideas please?
[01:52:28] <Sebah> Okay. I have the following options https://github.com/mmonteleone/jquery.safetynet && misterdai.wordpress.com/2010/06/04/jquery-form-changed-warning/. The two scripts are working as I expected, the only thing I'd like to be different is the popup message. So can I stylize that standard browser popup to run into fancybox or something?! Thanks
[01:52:33] <xec> caption: what do you really want to know?
[01:52:51] <caption> about jquey...n javascript
[01:53:01] <johnline> hi BinaryKitten
[01:53:37] <xec> caption: that sounds really general, there are many books discussing these topics at length
[01:53:56] <krz> anyone here good with regex?
[01:54:03] <xec> caption: if you want a specific answer, you need a specific question
[01:54:21] <xec> krz: i'm mediocre!
[01:54:51] <xec> krz: but if you want a question answered you should just ask it ;) maybe someone will know
[01:54:57] <krz> titleize('foobar') returns Foobar. titleize('foo bar') returns Foo Bar. everything so far is good. But, titleize('foo_bar') SHOULD return Foo Bar
[01:55:03] <krz> http://pastie.org/4043031
[01:56:36] <caption> Iz jquery depend on html??
[01:56:44] <xec> well, you're matching a whitespace with the \s
[01:57:23] <xec> caption: no, but a lot of the methods are extending the DOM, which you could say "depends" on thml
[01:57:26] <caption> No i dont know any thing abt j query
[01:58:01] <xec> caption: jQuery is mainly used for html websites
[01:58:18] <Sebah> xec: you're my man! can you please have a look at my question as well, obviously if you have time :)
[01:58:39] <caption> oh i see
[01:59:17] <caption> Generally for what reasons jquery is used??
[01:59:32] <NodeX> making coffee

[01:59:50] <caption> Really!!
[02:00:34] <xec> Sebah: i didn't quite get the question to be honest, what part of that script is failing? what happens and what is it supposed to do instead?
[02:01:17] <caption> so i want coffee can u get me please??
[02:01:46] <Sebah> xec: the script is not failling, is working as it is supposed to. I'm just wondering if I could replace that standard browser alert box with, let's say, something like fancybox.
[02:01:58] <hooloovoo> caption: you'd have to script that yourself
[02:03:15] <xec> caption: have you looked at coffescript?
[02:03:32] <xec> +e
[02:03:33] <caption> Ok then wahtz the script for that??
[02:04:04] <caption> no i didnt

[02:39:18] <_Fuse_> I was using jQuery's mouseleave event and came across the problem that it is triggered when the user enters the autocomplete (firefox) dropdown box of an input field inside the div I bound mouseleave to. you can learn the prob. here (you must have login name save by firefox for test) : http://jsfiddle.net/_Fuse_/FjjnT/
[02:39:23] <afidegnum> ok, I want to bind a jquery plugin to drupal, who is familair with drupal here, ?
[02:44:04] <Jeroenem> hi guys, im stuck with some simple jQuery... i have a set of image i want to slide in on hover, this what i got so far.. but it needs to be more dynamic and only target the image related to the year i hovered on
[02:44:07] <Jeroenem> http://jsfiddle.net/fuALm/6/
[02:44:31] <johnline> function output() {$('.hovertext').fadeOut(600).html(this.alt).fadeIn(600);} i have this line of code to fadeout a piece of text, change it, then fade it in, but when the trigger is hovered i see the text change immediately, fadeout then fadein
[02:44:45] <nFFF> _Fuse_, whats wrong with that code
[02:44:55] <johnline> not sure what to do to delay the .tml()
[02:44:59] <johnline> *.html()
[02:47:43] <_Fuse_> nFFF: with firefox only, when you have login saved a dropdow apear under textinput and if you put your mouse in it trigger an mouseleave and close window popup
[02:48:09] <nFFF> var that = this; $('.hovertext').fadeOut(600).queue(function() { $(this).html(that.alt); $(this).dequeue(); } ).fadeIn(600);}
[02:48:11] <_Fuse_> very strange
[02:48:29] <xec> johnline: the .delay() is only for animations. you can use setTimeout instead
[02:48:44] <nFFF> Oh ok, don't use FF :<
[02:49:02] <kelye> hello
[02:49:36] <kelye> i have a modal window that loads a form
[02:49:44] <_Fuse_> :(
[02:49:47] <shoky> i'd just do  .fadeOut(600, function() { $(this).html(this.alt).fadeIn(600) })
[02:49:54] <kelye> to mark the fact that it was loaded in a modal form i want to add an element
[02:50:02] <kelye> $('form', form).append('<isModal />');
[02:50:17] <kelye> and then i check with console.log($('isModal', form).length);
[02:50:19] <kelye> returns 0
[02:50:47] <_Fuse_> nobody has already had the problem?
[02:51:17] <vovvawrk> This only works if i run it in the console, what is wrong?: jQuery(document).ready(function() { jQuery('#facebook #feed .post .box .image').css({top: function(index, value) { return -((jQuery('img', this).height() - 196)/2); }}); });
[02:51:55] <nFFF> vovvawrk, nice selector :D
[02:52:11] <nFFF> thats going to slow your shit right down
[02:52:37] <vovvawrk> okay, i will take a look at it :)
[02:53:02] <vovvawrk> ut it looks like the jQuery(document).ready don't work
[02:53:37] <johnline> thanks xec and shoky, experimenting now
[02:56:45] <_helpPlz_> hi i have a question regarding $.ajax() .. i am kinda confused.. i am unable to understand this {context} correctly.. would scripts in head of url be loaded if i specify {context: document.body}?
[02:57:16] <_helpPlz_> wait let me experiment it
[03:00:14] <runvnc> help you don't need to set the context
[03:00:44] <runvnc> help use this $(document).ready(function() {
[03:02:31] <_helpPlz_> runvnc: i am trying to create a function with $.ajax() to load particular page as overlay in a particular element, but that page has jquery.js scripts.. so, it goes into loop with ajax calls and mozilla crashes?
[03:02:54] <_helpPlz_> loop as in it downloads data in parts as firebug tells me
[03:04:40] <scathen^C> hey guys, i have a largish chunk of static html (a floating toolbar) that i want to append at a particular time. Is there anything wrong with defining this chunk in .js (just like var chunk = '<whatever....'; ?
[03:05:27] <runvnc> help: either load the other page as an iframe, or take the scripts out of that page and put them in the parent page
[03:07:23] <scathen^C> i guess if i rephrase the question, is it better to put a chunk of html and hide it on load, or define it in .js and append it when required?
[03:09:42] <_helpPlz_> runvnc: thats fine but i was wondering if its possible to strip off certain scripts off it and/or certain elements?
[03:09:53] <runvnc> I think you probably will have a better time defining it in html and having it hidden initially
[03:09:55] <runvnc> scathen
[03:09:55] <runvnc> or
[03:10:01] <zatan> hey is there anyway I can find out a "ID" length , $('.row{0]').length   where is {0} there could be any number ?
[03:10:03] <runvnc> use <script type="text/template">
[03:10:33] <_helpPlz_> umm let me rephrase it, how do you manipulate responseText (html) document? wouldn't jquery create a new element if i pass it to $(responseText)?
[03:11:03] <Lexflex3000> is anybody here using Sublime Text 2 on windows?
[03:11:04] <runvnc> you can call replace or whatever on the response html from your .ajax help
[03:11:11] <Lexflex3000> (or maybe linux=
[03:11:20] <runvnc> just do that before you $('placetoputresponsehtml').html(newmodifiedhtml)
[03:11:56] <_helpPlz_> zatan: use $().prop()?
[03:12:48] <runvnc> zatan the selector inside of $() is a string
[03:12:54] <runvnc> you can build the string like any other
[03:13:20] <runvnc> so you can say $('.row[' + therownumber + ']) .. but thats not a valid selector
[03:13:23] <runvnc> I think you want nth
[03:13:40] <runvnc> http://api.jquery.com/eq-selector/
[03:13:41] <zatan> runvnc, I need to match beggining of string as i have got many rows like "row1" "row2" ... but i need much just beggining of $('.row').length
[03:13:42] <runvnc> or eq
[03:14:04] <zatan> as i dont know how many rows is going to be there
[03:14:21] <xec> zatan: is this a table?
[03:14:27] <zatan> xec yes
[03:14:30] <xec> and you want to select all the rows?
[03:14:40] <zatan> xec yes but it coud be 100 row
[03:14:45] <runvnc> zatan $('.itsarow').length
[03:14:50] <runvnc> $('li').length
[03:14:52] <xec> how about $("table tr")
[03:15:15] <xec> where "table" would be the selector for your table, like a class or an id perhaps?
[03:15:35] <runvnc> $('tr').each(function() { $(this)... } )
[03:15:45] <xec> it won't care how many table rows there are, it'll just select all the <tr>s
[03:15:53] <runvnc> actually you dont need each right
[03:15:57] <runvnc> depending on what you are doing
[03:16:08] <runvnc> yeah no you dont
[03:16:20] <runvnc> $('tr').css('backgroundColor', 'red')
[03:16:26] <runvnc> makes all rows red
[03:17:04] <runvnc> you really dont want row1 row2 row3 zatan
[03:17:12] <runvnc> I am fairly sure you don't need to do that
[03:17:40] <zatan> runvnc, why is that i need to count how many rows are there and display on popup
[03:17:56] <runvnc> alert($('tr').length)
[03:18:01] <xec> there is also a "starts with" attribute selector, but seeing as you can have multiple classes it's not a brilliant idea
[03:18:04] <_helpPlz_> :)
[03:18:58] <zatan> cheers guys for your help i think i have figure it out :)
[03:23:24] <_helpPlz_> runvnc: i meant how can i manipulate [html] downloaded via ajax using jquery before saving into $(selector).html()?
[03:24:58] <runvnc> newhtml = html.replace('dog', 'cat')
[03:25:05] <runvnc> $(selector).html(newhtml)
[03:25:50] <runvnc> .get('/dogs', function(res) { nowcats = res.replace('dog','cat'); $('.showcats').html(nowcats); } );
[03:28:52] <arphen> ii'm having a problem with listviews in jquerymobile, im only getting an empty circle icon instead of an arrow icon
[03:28:58] <arphen> http://93.133.234.139/home/Mobile/#layout-test
[03:32:02] <nebmo> how come this substring script doesnt work? (http://jsfiddle.net/P9StL/2/)
[03:32:46] <nebmo> none of the different methods (commented out) work :(
[03:38:18] <runvnc>  nebmo http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_substring.asp
[03:38:24] <runvnc> substring is between from and to
[03:38:25] <runvnc> not length
[03:38:41] <runvnc> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/substr
[03:38:46] <runvnc> substr uses length as second parameter
[03:38:55] <runvnc> $(input).val(substr(0, count_nolastword));
[03:39:05] <runvnc> whoops
[03:39:07] <runvnc> wait
[03:39:13] <runvnc> that doesnt have the string
[03:39:28] <nebmo> hmm. i was trying substr before too.
[03:39:38] <runvnc> $(input).val($(input).val().substr(0, count_nolastword));
[03:40:30] <runvnc> see $(input.val(   which is the front part says "set the value of the element which has selector input to:"
[03:40:55] <runvnc> then the second part you say "get the value is substr of nothing starting at 0
[03:40:57] <runvnc> see substr
[03:40:59] <runvnc> is a method
[03:41:02] <runvnc> on a string
[03:41:09] <runvnc> you did not specify a string to call substr on
[03:41:12] <nebmo> runvnc: nice! made it a bit buggy though. its meant to stop more than "maxlimit" words. :)
[03:42:09] <nebmo> yeh makes sense :)
[03:42:46] <runvnc> nebmo why can't you just use text.split(' ')
[03:42:51] <_helpPlz_> runvnc: hey sorry, my isp >.< did you get my question
[03:43:32] <nebmo> because i didnt know that exists! :D will check it out. thank you
[03:43:48] <runvnc> helpPlz .get('/dogs', function(res) { nowcats = res.replace('dog','cat'); $('.showcats').html(nowcats); } );
[03:43:51] <runvnc> nebmo
[03:43:52] <runvnc> do this
[03:43:59] <runvnc> go to the address bar in your web browser
[03:44:03] <runvnc> type google.com
[03:44:05] <nebmo> in performance  is it still good? (for large amounts of text)
[03:44:07] <runvnc> then when google.com loads
[03:44:15] <runvnc> type 'word count javascript'
[03:44:21] <runvnc> and hit enter
[03:44:28] <runvnc> then click on the first thing that comes up on that page
[03:44:59] <nebmo> ^_^ thanks. I been googling for AAAGEESS. the 'word count javascript' i used one of the scripts before, and people were saying when they wrote lots in the textarea, it was slowing the browser down :S
[03:46:39] <_helpPlz_> runvnc: thanks i am aware of that, but i am looking for some jquery way of manipulating it. don't really want to goto regexp for replace and all
[03:46:52] <runvnc> nebmo, maybe if it calculates the word count on every keystroke, instead of doing that, you could use a setInterval and recalculate the word count every 1000ms
[03:47:04] <runvnc> setInteval('calculateWordCount',  1000)
[03:47:10] <runvnc> setInterval('calculateWordCount',  1000)
[03:48:36] <runvnc> helplz: ok then function(res) { $('.tempdomcontainer').html(res); $('.tempdomcontainer .cats').html('dogs'); $('.finalplace').html($('.tempdomcontainer').html())
[03:52:46] <_helpPlz_> runvnc: i found something regarding it. let me try asking ##javascript
[03:52:54] <_helpPlz_> runvnc: http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.javascript/browse_thread/thread/762990f37ae218a3/6e0d948e1820bf24,
[03:55:15] <Jeroenem> Hey guys, i've got a super simple script, but it's way too big for what it does.. just cant get it how to make this shorter, any suggestions tips? http://jsfiddle.net/UQFuj/
[03:55:38] <nanovirus> experiencing a weird issue with the datepicker for jqueryui... using it on a very small modal, and it's appearing then disappearing again (~1s)... any ideas?
[03:56:42] <fourlastor> hello everyone, i was wondering why here http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Plugin_Methods the methods are defined out of the fn.pluginName function, is there a particoular reason?
[03:57:17] <_helpPlz_> Jeroenem: use .next()
[03:57:32] <userfriendly> is it possible to customise the jQuery UI autocomplete widget so that i can return HTML from the server, and the result is not shown in a dropdown menu underneath the input, but instead written to any other DOM element on the page?
[04:01:11] <runvnc> userfriendly, http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#option-appendTo
[04:02:19] <userfriendly> runvnc: cheers!
[04:03:05] <runvnc> cheers
[04:08:42] <lunders> hi all, iv got abit of HTML here but wot im wondering is that can I pass a dynamic userID into it so that when you click on the contact in question it loads their own personal details called from the Userid? if that makes sense http://jsfiddle.net/
[04:08:46] <lunders> fs
[04:09:30] <lunders> http://www.lundy.me.uk/metro/index.php is my code
[04:10:01] <johnline> php errors stop the page from showing here
[04:11:03] <lunders> 2mins I must have linked zend wrong :P
[04:11:25] <runvnc> lunders how are yo upassing the userid into the javascript
[04:11:47] <runvnc> are you assigning it as a var that you echo or something or are you passing it in the querystring ?
[04:11:54] <lunders> This is where I would like your input as I am clueless ....
[04:12:03] <runvnc> oh
[04:12:04] <runvnc> nevermind
[04:12:07] <runvnc> misunderstood
[04:12:11] <runvnc> userid comes from the li
[04:12:23] <runvnc> output the id with the php
[04:12:34] <runvnc> <li id="thedudesid">dudesname</li>
[04:12:37] <runvnc> output that with php
[04:13:11] <runvnc> then $('li').on('click', function() {dudesid = $(this).attr('id'); });
[04:13:41] <lunders> just uploading the code now
[04:13:42] <runvnc> $.get('/dudes/'+dudesid'), function(res) { $('.dudesection').html(res);})
[04:14:33] <runvnc> or $.get('dudes.php?id='+dudesid' ...
[04:15:09] <lunders> http://www.lundy.me.uk/metro/index.php files have been uploaded
[04:16:16] <runvnc> lunders what do you think of my solution
[04:17:43] <lunders> sounds like a plan .........
[04:18:27] <lunders> so if I do   <li class="tile high" data-target-activation="click" data-target="contacts_details" id="12345"> or would I need to just write a script to do a on click go to contact_details and do this ?
[04:20:02] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/7c5eP/3/ - Could anyone help me with this littel jquery script. For some reason it wont remove the image correctly when hovering the next image.
[04:21:34] <runvnc> lunders I would use $('.tile').on('click' or something like that
[04:21:57] <runvnc> ok
[04:21:57] <lunders> so i would need to scrap data-target stuff?
[04:21:58] <runvnc> hm
[04:22:05] <fourlastor> is that correct? http://pastebin.com/8qFk2hXG i'm using a variable instead of writing the plugin name, but i don't know if it's better or worse :)
[04:22:10] <runvnc> why is important for the data attributes to specify how the jquery works
[04:22:12] <runvnc> lunders
[04:22:25] <runvnc> its looks like you are trying to make it so that your events are dynamically wired
[04:22:31] <runvnc> according to the php that you generate
[04:22:35] <lunders> brb 2mins going to download mirc this webchat is hurting my eyes
[04:22:35] <runvnc> why is that necessary?
[04:24:50] <runvnc> fourlastor
[04:24:56] <runvnc> fourlastor, why are you doing that
[04:25:05] <runvnc> fourlastor, it might be pretty cool, if there is a reason
[04:25:24] <runvnc> fourlastor, if you don't have a reason to do that, then you are making it harder to understand whats going on, and harder to maintain
[04:25:34] <granden> Anyone got any inputs on my hover image script?
[04:26:05] <fourlastor> runvnc, i think it's easier than refactoring it if needed
[04:26:33] <granden> fixed it, sorry guys. :)
[04:26:56] <fourlastor> runvnc, also, i was wondering if it's better to namespace it using also the version :) so it would be easier with PLUGIN_NAME + VERSION
[04:27:30] <fourlastor> runvnc, the namespace could be PLUGIN_NAMESPACE = PLUGIN_NAME + PLUGIN_VERSION
[04:28:42] <runvnc> fourlastor thats an interesting idea
[04:28:50] <runvnc> you might also consider just using classes
[04:29:08] <fourlastor> runvnc, classes where? instead of data?
[04:30:04] <sahbeewah> fourlastor: http://jsfiddle.net/7c5eP/8/
[04:30:05] <fourlastor> runvnc, it's an experiment btw, i'm new at jquery developing, i'm more a php programmer and usually the js part is left to the js programmer in my team
[04:31:32] <runvnc> fourlaster it seems like a cool idea, I would be happy to tell you there is a better/easier way to do that, but I can't without seeing some examples of how you are doing it
[04:31:38] <runvnc> I mean
[04:31:44] <runvnc> examples of these plugins you are implementing
[04:31:50] <runvnc> or games
[04:31:52] <runvnc> to me
[04:31:59] <sahbeewah> sorry
[04:32:00] <runvnc> if the jquery plugin implements an entire game
[04:32:01] <sahbeewah> granden: http://jsfiddle.net/7c5eP/8/
[04:32:08] <fourlastor> runvnc, well at the moment it's just that file :) i started 10 minutes ago
[04:32:10] <runvnc> then really thats not what jquery plugins are for
[04:32:15] <fourlastor> sahbeewah, ah ok xD i wasn't understanding :P
[04:32:30] <fourlastor> runvnc, no, i wanted to create something like gameQuery
[04:33:15] <granden> sahbeewah: Thanks, I think I did it myself as well, rather diffrently though.
[04:33:16] <granden> http://jsfiddle.net/7c5eP/7/
[04:33:18] <granden> like that
[04:33:24] <runvnc> fourlastor so basically instead of one game engine
[04:33:26] <granden> Yours look cleaner though.
[04:33:28] <fourlastor> i liked the idea but not really some pieces of implementation, and i saw the project has been sleeping for months
[04:33:31] <runvnc> there would be lots of different game engines?
[04:33:33] <Lundy> runvnc: back, now on mIRC :)
[04:33:39] <runvnc> ok lundy
[04:34:07] <Lundy> So I would be better doing like <li id="12345">runvnc</li> then doing like
[04:34:47] <Lundy> $('li').on('click', function() { alert($(this).attr('id')); });
[04:35:24] <granden> If I want to put a div ontop of the enterie page, is that jquery or CSS, it should be pretty similair to a lightbox
[04:35:49] <fourlastor> runvnc, i gave a look at the code of gamequery, the problem is that sometimes it rewrites entire parts that can be taken from standard jquery
[04:35:51] <granden> could I have a div that I display and put on top of everything else?
[04:36:13] <fourlastor> granden, with z-index?
[04:36:14] <nanovirus> granden, yes, you can do that with CSS and you can manipulate that using jquery
[04:36:27] <fourlastor> it's a css property
[04:37:16] <runvnc> lundy I would do it simply, rather than trying to make it completly dynamic like you had before, unless there is a reason
[04:37:56] <scathen^C> hey guys i am trying to split my jquery stuff up between different js files. how do i use an object from another file if it is wrapped in function($){}(jQuery)??
[04:38:23] <sahbeewah> instead of using the id attribute, use data-id, then you can access it with $(this).data('id');
[04:38:31] <granden> fourlastor: Ok, so I should work with z-index. Thanks will give it a try
[04:38:40] <fourlastor> granden, you're welcome :)
[04:39:36] <fourlastor> runvnc, do you think i'm doing something 'evil'? :P
[04:41:37] <scathen^C> ??
[04:43:05] <userfriendly> runvnc: somehow autocomplete is ignoring my appendTo option :( i'm overriding _renderItem, which works nicely, but the stuff is still appended to the menu underneath the input as opposed to the DOM element where i want the output to appear. http://pastie.org/4043812
[04:43:47] <runvnc> fourlastor I don't think its evil, its cool as long as there are going to be a number of different game engines
[04:43:51] <mason-l> Hello #jquery
[04:44:12] <runvnc> userfriendly, put it in a jsfiddle
[04:44:22] <johnline> a big angry poo is pushing on the walls of my anus while i am trying to write css
[04:44:40] <runvnc> what happens if you dont override renderitem and use the appendto
[04:44:55] <runvnc> johnline: tmi. take a shit.
[04:45:03] <johnline> :/\
[04:46:01] <Julien> hello
[04:46:07] <tga> in jquery mobile should it be safe to changePage and make changes on document.ready()?
[04:46:08] <runvnc> userfriendly if you have to then you can always step through the autocomplete code, set a breakpoint inside of the function that handles the keypress or whatever
[04:46:09] <fourlastor> runvnc, ok, another question, is there a standard way to make a plugin extensible? for example to give some defaults (point and click, fps, etc..) with already builded functionalities?
[04:46:42] <Julien> how to add an element to a previous defined stack ?
[04:46:45] <runvnc> fourlastor, http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Defaults_and_Options

[04:47:19] <Julien> thanks pachet
[04:47:33] <vectorshelve> I have a jquery plugin js + php for ads slideshow.. openads.. can I make it js + java ? is it possible /
[04:47:49] <pachet> vectorshelve: sure
[04:47:54] <fourlastor> runvnc, pachet yes, but that's for extending options, i was thinking about oop inheritance to make a plugin a child of another plugin
[04:48:06] <runvnc> then what dude said
[04:48:07] <runvnc> extend
[04:48:09] <runvnc> I think
[04:48:09] <vectorshelve> pachet: just to know is php a front end tech or back end or both ?
[04:48:17] <pachet> fourlastor: oh i see
[04:48:22] <pachet> then definitely not just extend
[04:48:29] <fourlastor> yes i though so
[04:48:36] <runvnc> http://bililite.com/blog/extending-jquery-ui-widgets/
[04:48:42] <runvnc> fourlastor: you could ask whirl3d
[04:48:47] <pachet> fourlastor: i'd read up on javascript mixin pattern
[04:49:08] <vectorshelve> pachet: I am working on openads.. u know it ? http://www.honeymoonsbydavidsbridal.com/ This Month's Hot Deals! section is openads
[04:49:18] <pachet> vectorshelve: typically backend
[04:49:19] <runvnc> if you search the logs whirl3d was just doing inheritence with jquery plugins a little while ago in here
[04:49:20] <pachet> and no i dont know it
[04:49:41] <fourlastor> runvnc, ok, thanks, i'll look it up
[04:49:51] <vectorshelve> pachet: ok but the view has file.php so I got confused
[04:51:09] <Guest81738> Hi! Is it possible to change css property for specific media type?
[04:51:23] <pachet> php is typically instantiated via your web server when files of a certain type ( .php ) are requested
[04:51:26] <Guest81738> google didn't give any answer
[04:51:29] <pachet> vectorshelve^
[04:51:49] <vectorshelve> pachet: http://www.programmersheaven.com/mb/phpstuff/186228/186228/is-php-more-front-end-than-back-end/ gives an opposite opinion to that of urs
[04:51:55] <runvnc> http://bililite.com/blog/extending-jquery-ui-widgets/
[04:53:25] <fourlastor> vectorshelve, some frameworks use .php files as views
[04:53:40] <pachet> Guest81738: i'd recommend choosing a different nick, it will make it easier for folks to help you
[04:53:43] <pachet> that said, yes its possible
[04:54:09] <pachet> with javascript, you're able to dynamically create <style> elements with a certain media type
[04:54:13] <pachet> and append them to the DOM
[04:54:35] <pachet> but i strongly recommend just baking in whatever media instructions you know you're going to need, and referencing them via class
[04:54:35] <grumpy_snail> so plain javascript, not jQuery?
[04:54:50] <pachet> then just toggle those classes on the elements in question
[04:55:12] <vectorshelve> pachet: ^^
[04:55:34] <grumpy_snail> problem is: screen css should not be affected; and I have to change css for print media dynamically
[04:56:04] <pachet> grumpy_snail: then i suppose see this SO answer:
[04:56:05] <pachet> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/798535/changing-media-specific-css-properties-from-javascript
[04:56:52] <grumpy_snail> pachet: looks very promising, thanks a lot!
[04:57:00] <pachet> yw
[04:57:53] <tga> in jqmobile how can you get the page name in the pagechange handler?
[04:57:54] <ruby_on_tails> hmm...
[04:58:40] <fourlastor> pachet, i got an idea! what do you think about .extend() the method var?
[04:59:32] <fourlastor> still i'm not really sure about the pluginName('method-name') calling way
[05:00:14] <pachet> i guess i'd have to see an example
[05:00:24] * pachet is still groggy this early in the morning :[
[05:00:37] <pachet> tga: you have to specify it yourself
[05:00:52] <pachet> eg, by passing it into the options when you call $.mobile.loadPage()
[05:01:19] <pachet> because those options are transferred as the options property of the second argument passed into the pageload callback
[05:01:21] <tga> pachet: it's annoying that you call $.changePage('#foo') and you don't get that '#foo' in the pagechange event handler
[05:02:18] <tga> but anyway, I got it from window.location.hash, it's alright
[05:02:24] * tga has bigger issues than this
[05:03:26] <pachet> tga: oh i see
[05:03:29] <Lundy> runvnc u still about?
[05:03:31] <pachet> so not some arbitrary name
[05:03:35] <pachet> tga: but rather the path
[05:03:45] <tga> right
[05:03:48] <pachet> tga: the second argument passed into the pagechange event
[05:03:53] <pachet> has a property 'toPage'
[05:03:59] <sahbeewah> hey so i got a piece of code which adds a row to a table based on data retrieved from an ajax call, but the row has quite a bit of html in it so it kinda looks like this atm: http://jsfiddle.net/FXZz2/  is there any way to make that better?
[05:04:01] <tga> yeah, that's a jquery object!
[05:04:04] <pachet> should give you the path you requested in $.m.changePage()
[05:04:04] <Lundy> when I use 		$(".contact12345").click(function() {			browsertiles.loadTarget("contacts_details");		}); I get this error.
[05:04:10] <Lundy> originating.attr is not a function
[05:04:10] <Lundy> var target = originating.attr('data-target');
[05:04:31] <tga> pachet: toPage: e.fn.e.init[1]
[05:04:31] <vl1234> gud even
[05:04:44] <Lundy> here is the code. http://localhost/metro/index.php
[05:04:45] <pachet> tga: herm
[05:05:04] <runvnc> lundy

[05:05:12] <_helpPlz_> lol
[05:05:14] <Lundy> ^_^ whoops lol
[05:05:16] <runvnc> lundy
[05:05:18] <runvnc> try this
[05:05:18] <pachet> tga: according to the docs, the value of that property should match exactly what you passed into .changePage()
[05:05:23] <runvnc> console.log(originating)
[05:05:29] <tga> pachet: it doesn't
[05:05:32] <runvnc> look at the output with firebug or chrome developer tools
[05:05:37] <runvnc> if there is no attr function
[05:05:42] <runvnc> that means its not a jquery object
[05:05:47] <Lundy> ReferenceError: originating is not defined

[05:06:37] <tga> pachet: mmkay, I see what's happening
[05:06:57] <tga> pachet: changePage is triggered by the framework when clicking links
[05:06:58] <runvnc> lundy contacts works
[05:07:09] <pachet> tga: oh so you're not calling it manually
[05:07:17] <Lundy> runvnc: click on the first Contact.......

[05:11:34] <Lundy> :-/ this is making my head hurt
[05:11:48] <runvnc> lundy: inside of loadTarget do this:

[05:13:52] <runvnc> sorry I am starting to get a little bit drunk so I don't think I can help too much more
[05:14:01] <_helpPlz_> lol
[05:15:08] <pachet> _helpPlz_: there is no :nth-element selector
[05:15:11] <pachet> you might be thinking of
[05:15:13] <Lundy> runvnc: line 11 in main.js?
[05:15:20] <pachet> ?nth-child @ _helpPlz_
[05:15:21] <bot-t> _helpPlz_, :nth-child(index/even/odd/equation): Selects all elements that are the nth-child of their parent. http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/
[05:15:30] <pachet> that said, nth-child isnt really what he's asking for
[05:15:31] <_helpPlz_> :nth-child ya
[05:15:43] <pachet> he wants every fourth, nth- just gets you the one at a specific index
[05:16:26] <runvnc> lundy yes
[05:16:48] <_helpPlz_> wouldn't something like index() % 4 work?
[05:17:19] <sahbeewah> :nth-child(4n)
[05:20:33] <vl1234> hi hi.........
[05:20:47] <AdvoWork> i'm trying to use jquery ui tabs, which is working, but inside them i'm trying to use a graph plugin, this worked fine previously, but worked on document ready. now that i've got my graph stuff in a tab, its not working; no errors. I've currently got:  $(document).ready(function(){ alert("ready");$(document).delegate("#second", "click", function(event) {  alert("2nd");  where #second is the id of my tab <div id="second"> it alerts ready but not
[05:20:48] <AdvoWork> 2nd. Any ideas please?
[05:24:49] <vl1234> am created json file like "list" : [ "a: b", "a: c" , "e: x", "e:y"]...........we can divide like "b:c" under "a" and "x:y" under "e" using jquery.........its possible in jquery./ Any Idea?
[05:31:23] <Lundy> runvnc: cant seem to get it at all :(
[05:32:52] <runvnc> lundy hit the update button
[05:34:24] <Lundy> :o
[05:35:05] <runvnc> lundy
[05:35:07] <runvnc> you know what
[05:35:09] <runvnc> I think maybe
[05:35:17] <runvnc> in the click event for the data-target whatever
[05:35:21] <runvnc> maybe $(this)
[05:35:23] <runvnc> is like a string
[05:35:25] <runvnc> its just a string
[05:35:33] <runvnc> did you do what I suggest
[05:35:42] <Lundy> I tried but failed :/
[05:35:45] <runvnc> put a console.log (this) at the top of the function
[05:35:49] <runvnc> what was the output
[05:36:16] <runvnc> change it to use a plain old class
[05:36:21] <runvnc> instead of the data-blah stuff
[05:36:53] <Lundy> runvnc: im just doing this as a test but if I cannot get it doing what I want today im going to scrap the idea of a Metro UI for my website
[05:37:29] <Lundy> console_log reports this <li id="12345" class="tile high contact12345" data-target="contacts_details" data-target-activation="click">
[05:38:23] <runvnc> lundy thats good
[05:38:28] <runvnc> its the li great
[05:38:34] <runvnc> dont fucking scrap the idea
[05:38:43] <runvnc> you have down a beautiful idea
[05:38:49] <runvnc> beautiful job I mean
[05:39:33] <runvnc> lundy
[05:39:37] <Lundy> yes?
[05:39:42] <runvnc> question is console log outputting a DOM element
[05:39:45] <runvnc> or a jquery object
[05:39:48] <runvnc> if its a dom element
[05:39:56] <runvnc> then it doesnt have an attr method
[05:40:21] <Lundy> :-/
[05:40:30] * Lundy kicks script in the head ....
[05:40:32] <Lundy> ha take that
[05:40:39] <runvnc> if you wrap a dom element in $(el) like that
[05:40:43] <runvnc> then it is a jquery element
[05:40:46] <runvnc> with .attr function
[05:41:06] <runvnc> http://html5doctor.com/html5-custom-data-attributes/
[05:41:12] <runvnc> maybe jquery is not picking up the data-
[05:41:24] <runvnc> plant.getAttribute('data-fruit');
[05:41:54] * Lundy has sore head
[05:42:35] <runvnc> originating.getAttribute(
[05:42:36] <runvnc> lundy
[05:42:38] <runvnc> first of all
[05:42:46] <runvnc> do not scrap the idea, you are 95% done
[05:42:50] <runvnc> secondly, take a break
[05:42:53] <runvnc> and come back to it tomorrow
[05:43:09] <Lundy> runvnc: cant, need to press on with it lol
[05:43:32] <runvnc> try getAttribute
[05:43:39] <runvnc> assume you do not have a jquery object
[05:43:56] <Lundy> runvnc: what im trying to do is if you click on the contact it will go to Contact_details bit then Grab the Contacts ID and load their details
[05:44:50] <Lundy> but I think the way this is working I wont be able to do that
[05:45:23] <vargadanis> good morning everyone! I have an issue with JQuery UI... I have tied the click event of a modal dialog's button to submitting a form. That part works well however when I click the button it starts multiple AJAX requests... any tip why that could be?
[05:45:28] <xmaddness> Not sure why you are passinging a click in the data though. I am assuming a click is assumed?
[05:45:45] <xmaddness> or are you adding other events like mouseover or something?
[05:46:25] <xmaddness> vargadanis: possibly the click event is bubbling up the dom?
[05:46:34] <vargadanis> xmaddness: if the question is directed to me than no.. no mouseover, no nothing is tied to the button, only the click event
[05:46:38] <xmaddness> try hitting it with a stopPropagation?
[05:46:42] <vargadanis> xmaddness: that is possible... would th...
[05:46:47] <vargadanis> yeah that would have been my guess
[05:47:16] <xmaddness> vargadanis: then you could just bind to the click event and pull the $(elm).data() then?
[05:47:24] <xmaddness> just curious
[05:47:34] <runvnc> lundy
[05:47:36] <runvnc> its working for me
[05:47:46] <xmaddness> erm not vargadanis
[05:47:53] <xmaddness> that was intended for lundy
[05:47:54] <runvnc> completely working
[05:47:58] <runvnc> perfectly
[05:48:11] <runvnc> lundy you fixed it!
[05:48:11] <xmaddness> vargadanis: yeah most likly a event running wild
[05:48:16] <xmaddness> try the stopPropagation
[05:50:22] <vargadanis> xmaddness: ehh... well I put in stopPropagation however I still get multiple requests
[05:50:39] <xmaddness> hrmm
[05:51:01] <xmaddness> are you able to reproduce it in jsfiddle/
[05:51:09] <xmaddness> so I can take a look
[05:52:05] <Lundy> runvnc: got it (well i think
[05:52:12] <Lundy> 		$(".contact12345").click(function() {				$("#put_stuff div p").html($(this).attr('id'));	});
[05:52:17] <runvnc> lundy it worked for me!
[05:52:46] <Lundy> :) so simple lol !!!
[05:52:51] <runvnc> man I am pretty drunk
[05:53:09] <Lundy> you are ........ GRRRRRRR :P why not say that at the start #drunkenbum
[05:54:12] <diverdude> why does this always print foo: console.log("somestring"+(mailval.Messageconversationthread.id!=null)?"foo":"bar") while this one prints correctly depending on the value of mailval.Messageconversationthread.id? console.log((mailval.Messageconversationthread.id!=null)?"foo":"bar") ?
[05:54:54] <granden> http://a45.se/actesolutions2/slider.html - Got a bit of problem with that.
[05:55:31] <granden> If you press the laptop the big one, it opens a new div. but the hover-image function wont work in that one
[05:55:33] <jwg2s> Hi all, trying to fade a div if it's out of the viewport, and fade it in if it's within the viewport.  http://jsfiddle.net/Agdax/1/
[05:55:51] <jwg2s> Not really sure how to tackle this.. tried yesterday but to no avail so I created a jsfiddle
[05:56:16] <runvnc> lundy I wasnt that drunk when we started
[05:56:22] <shoky> diverdude: because the + is getting higher priority than the ?
[05:56:44] <shoky> diverdude: console.log("somestring" + ( (mailval.Messageconversationthread.id!=null)?"foo":"bar" ))
[05:56:49] <diverdude> aha
[05:56:51] <diverdude> thx
[05:58:36] <Lundy> lol runvnc
[05:58:38] <vargadanis> xmaddness: jfdiggle? googling now

[05:59:22] <consumerism> i'm using $.ajax() and when the server returns a 500 resonse, the error: function is not called. why?
[05:59:28] <xmaddness> lol
[06:00:04] <xmaddness> consumerism: check your console network settings in the XHR tab to see what the actual args are being passed in
[06:00:29] <xmaddness> its either the args are not being passed, or something server side is going horribly wrong
[06:00:34] <xmaddness> I'm guessing the former
[06:01:35] <Lundy> <h1><button>TEST</button>MY TEXT TO REPLACE</h1> :/ how can I replace the 'My text to replace' inside h1 and still leave the button there?
[06:02:11] <consumerism> xmaddness: when you say 'the actual args are being passed in' what do you mean - i'm looking at the request in the net tab now
[06:02:35] <xmaddness> consumerism: usually when you are requesting something via ajax you send a request with POST or GET params
[06:02:47] <xmaddness> not always, but most times
[06:02:47] <consumerism> yes, there are POST params being sent as expected
[06:02:56] <consumerism> the server responds with a 500
[06:03:04] <consumerism> ajax error: function is not called
[06:03:11] <xmaddness> okay, get a REST app in chrome, and test the api (or server) with the post args in it
[06:03:28] <xmaddness> I use Advanced REST client
[06:03:57] <xmaddness> basically it lets you put in the url of the server side script or api, and lets you pass in get or post vars
[06:04:04] <xmaddness> test it to be sure its acting correctly
[06:05:37] <_helpPlz_> Lundy: $("h1").children() would return all tagged elements
[06:07:59] <BrixSat> Hello im doing a thing with tinymce and jquery plugin. I need to change the font-family of text using jquery but i cant find info on google on how to do it :S
[06:08:53] <xmaddness> BrixSat: .css or .addClass removeClass
[06:08:56] <JuJuBee> I cannot get to jquery.com for some reason.  downforeveryoneorjustme.com reports it as up.  Any suggestions?
[06:09:11] <BrixSat> xmaddness:  in a tinymce?
[06:09:18] <xmaddness> in jQuery
[06:09:26] <xmaddness> never used tinymce
[06:09:31] <BrixSat> xmaddness:  i need in tinymce using jquery
[06:09:33] <xmaddness> JuJu: try pinging it?
[06:10:00] <kelye> is there a way to get a form unique identifier ?
[06:10:01] <xmaddness> BrixSat: isn't tinymce just a ide?
[06:10:11] <BrixSat> xmaddness:  not quite
[06:10:37] <kelye> without having to specify #id
[06:10:37] <xmaddness> tinyMCE is a Spaw wysiwyg type thing eh?
[06:10:57] <xmaddness> kelye: maybe assign it a unique data-id?
[06:11:08] <_helpPlz_> Lundy: look http://jsfiddle.net/gBZw8/1/
[06:11:13] <kelye> ^:)^
[06:11:25] <kelye> but, except that
[06:11:33] <kelye> is there a way from jquery ?
[06:11:54] <xmaddness> well upon rendering the data-id will be available in .data
[06:12:18] <kelye> if i do in 2 different script something like $('form')  is there a way to say they reffer to the same form ?
[06:12:33] <xmaddness> or you can select the elm with a selector like $('fornm[data-id=someID]')
[06:13:35] <xmaddness> kelye: $('form') will be the collection of all forms on the page. If you know the index you may be able to use $('form').eq(index)
[06:13:53] <xmaddness> like if its always the first form, then $('form').eq(0)
[06:14:13] <kelye> well... i have a normal form, but on some ocasions i want to load it in a modal window
[06:14:47] <kelye> upon ajax submission i want to pass the result to a function that was definde in the page with the modal windo
[06:14:58] <kelye> the form itself contains the ajaxForm code
[06:15:12] <ChrisMarsh_> =\
[06:15:15] <kelye> so it will work standalone using ajax submit
[06:15:48] <kelye> so, when i load the form within a modal window i create a custom trigger event
[06:15:57] <kelye> that receives the ajax return
[06:16:08] <kelye> and the handler is defined in the page that creates the modal window
[06:16:32] <kelye> but since i can have multiple forms on page i want to bind the handler to that specific form
[06:16:49] <kelye> $('form').eq(0) won't work
[06:17:03] <kelye> i might just do the id thing after all... ty
[06:17:07] <ChrisMarsh_> k
[06:17:21] <shoky> k
[06:17:31] <xmadd_> got dc'd
[06:17:46] <shoky> wb
[06:17:47] <xmadd_> kelye: ok try the data-id thing
[06:17:52] <xmadd_> see if that gets you there
[06:29:04] <jwg2s> can anyone help me with my jsfiddle for fade-in/out depending on if div is in viewport? http://jsfiddle.net/Agdax/2/ questions about the concept
[06:30:06] <jeffreylevesque> does anyone know how to check the selectedIndex of a select element?
[06:30:52] <jeffreylevesque> I tried: if( $('#State').prop("selectedIndex") == 1) { alert('hello'); }
[06:33:19] <sahbeewah> the index begins at 0 fyi
[06:33:56] <jeffreylevesque> yup, i want to see if the second index was selected :)
[06:35:18] <kelye> if i do something like $('form', context) and context is a jquery form object
[06:35:39] <kelye> it loses the 'data' values from the context .. is this normal ?
[06:36:54] <shoky> the context changes to the being the form
[06:37:25] <shoky> just like context.find('form')
[06:37:27] <kelye> but the form is the same
[06:37:41] <kelye> so i should have my data-id="123"
[06:37:53] <shoky> on what element is the data
[06:38:08] <kelye> <form
[06:38:30] <shoky> then $('form', context).data(...) is fine..
[06:39:22] <kelye> i have something like $form = $('form') ; $form.data('id') == 123  but if i have $form2 = $('form', $form) then $form2.data('id') == undefined
[06:43:39] <shoky> you have a form inside a form ?
[06:44:46] <Goopyo> Question: How do I rebind buttons after a a .load()? I.e. my .click() method doesnt work after a load
[06:45:12] <shoky> Goopyo: re-bind? the load replaces the buttons?
[06:45:18] <Goopyo> yessir
[06:45:43] <Goopyo> to the 2nd part, first part: not sure what the term is, I want .click to work for the replaced buttons the same as it used to
[06:45:45] <shoky> so you either do just that: re-bind them after the load
[06:46:08] <Goopyo> how do I go about doing that?
[06:46:10] <shoky> or: you delegate the event handling to a container element (that isn't replaced by the load), with .on(...)
[06:46:23] <shoky> Goopyo: just like you did the first time
[06:47:07] <shoky> with delegation you only need to set it up once (no re-binding necessary)
[06:47:45] <shoky> it'd be something like:  $('#containerElement').on('click', '.buttonsClass', function() { ... })
[06:48:02] <Goopyo> not sure what I did the first time… just a $(document).ready() and a (#elemtn).click()
[06:48:15] <Goopyo> is the the $(document).ready what binds?
[06:48:51] <Goopyo> OH CRAP I remember what I did last time
[06:48:53] <Goopyo> I used live
[06:51:04] <sahbeewah> yes .live is effectively delegation with the parent element set to the document
[06:51:57] <sahbeewah> question, http://jsfiddle.net/FXZz2/ is this a dumb way of adding a new row to a table, where the row has lots of html
[06:52:50] <shoky> do you like it?
[06:53:21] <shoky> would you like to read/maintain such code?
[06:53:30] <kelye> is this a bug ? http://jsfiddle.net/LPpUN/
[06:53:45] <sahbeewah> trying to find best practices to achieve these things
[06:54:03] <sahbeewah> can't think of a better way
[06:54:11] <shoky> kelye: no it's not a bug
[06:54:33] <shoky> kelye:  doing $('form', $form);  is exactly like:   $form.find('form')
[06:55:06] <shoky> your form doesn't have any inner form inside it, so $form2 is an empty jq object
[06:55:29] <kelye> hm, just did a console.log
[06:55:47] <kelye> my first impression was that it was returning the form itself again
[06:57:16] <shoky> no that would be maybe  $form.filter('form')  or something..
[07:09:56] <jeffreylevesque> has anyone used the .change() function?
[07:10:23] <jeffreylevesque> is it a bad idea if i have 3 select list, to apply .change function to each select list?
[07:11:28] <Brodingo> jeffreylevesque not inherently bad
[07:11:35] <Brodingo> depends what youre doing
[07:15:05] <sjobidoo> i'm trying to style an element in an iframe's parent document without luck. Any advice how to do this? :)
[07:15:47] <Brodingo> use css
[07:16:54] <sjobidoo> i need to append stuff etc so i need a way to select the items through jquery
[07:17:04] <sjobidoo> styling it was just for testing :)
[07:17:19] <sjobidoo> basically trying to select the elements of the parent document
[07:17:23] <jeffreylevesque> Brodingo: I am trying to have one select list determine another - http://jsfiddle.net/vawa7/7/

[07:20:09] <Chirag> I want to check whether a checkbox is checked. I used "if($(":checkbox").prop("checked"))" but it doesnt work
[07:20:52] <Chirag> Any help would be appreciated.
[07:22:46] <sjobidoo> i managed to select the element in the parent document with javascript..any way to use jquery to achieve the same result as parent.document.getElementById  ?
[07:23:25] <Archer_xda> $("#ID")[0]
[07:23:55] <Archer_xda> $("#ID") returns a collection, so just use [0] to select the 1st item and you have the DOM element
[07:24:22] <Archer_xda> Sorry - I see parent document
[07:24:47] <Archer_xda> $("#ID", parent.document)[0]
[07:25:30] <sjobidoo> hm
[07:25:31] <bouzu> hi, how i can open a combo list (select list) without clicking an arrow
[07:25:37] <sjobidoo> tried: 	$('#feedback', parent.document)[0].css('border','1px solid red');    with no luck :/
[07:25:38] <Brodingo> jeffreylevesque http://jsfiddle.net/Brodingo/vawa7/11/
[07:26:14] <Archer_xda> sjobidoo - you said you want equivalent to getElementById so I said use [0].  Just remove that if you're using jQuery methods on it
[07:26:22] <Brodingo> sjobidoo [0] and .get() get the html element, which dont have .css() as a method
[07:26:37] <Archer_xda> sjobidoo - $("#ID", parent.document).css('border','1px solid red');
[07:27:25] <sjobidoo> aha...thanks alot :) sorry for my poor explanation of what i was trying to achieve :)
[07:27:43] <Archer_xda> sjobidoo - no problem :D
[07:28:04] <bouzu> any solution ?
[07:29:27] <zatan> hey how can I say call this function when checkbox is checke ? $('.delete input:checkbox').click(function(){
[07:29:30] <zatan> checked*
[07:29:55] <Archer_xda> bouzu - not sure if you can do that
[07:30:08] <bouzu> okey
[07:30:10] <Brodingo> zatan youll want to use .change()
[07:30:45] <bouzu> i'm trying to do ajax autocomplete , but after reponse i want a select list openin automaticly
[07:32:20] <Archer_xda> bouzu - Consider using a custom dropdown then, so it's a textbox and a div, rather than a dropdown
[07:33:22] <Archer_xda> bouzu - http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[07:33:41] <bouzu> or div with overflow : scroll maybe no ?
[07:33:59] <Archer_xda> bouzu - exactly
[07:34:24] <bouzu> ;) thnks
[07:34:30] <Archer_xda> np :)
[07:38:06] <Chirag> I want to check all checkboxes when one particular checkbox(of id 'all') is checked. What should be the condition?
[07:38:32] <jwg2s> i have a jsfiddle that shows elements as they enter the viewport, http://jsfiddle.net/Agdax/5/
[07:38:37] <jwg2s> but can't get them to disappear when they leave the viewport
[07:38:43] <jwg2s> can anyone help me get over this hump?
[07:39:00] <jwg2s> you have to scroll to see
[07:40:22] <jwg2s> really would appreciate help… i've been stuck here for hours
[07:40:29] <Chirag> Can anyone help me for the same?
[07:44:03] <jwg2s> Hmm not much activity here...
[07:44:36] <c0c0> sup guys
[07:44:45] <c0c0> i have a problem with jplayer
[07:44:49] <c0c0> any can help?
[07:44:51] <c0c0> plz
[07:44:51] <sacho> Chirag, what do you mean, "what should be the condition"?
[07:45:48] <c0c0> i am create this controller from php but it have bad playing :S
[07:46:19] <Chirag> sacho I meant if the checkbox of id 'all' is checked then do check all checkboxes. I tried if($(":checkbox").prop("checked")) but it doesnt work
[07:46:57] <hooloovoo> Chirag: umm
[07:47:10] <hooloovoo> Chirag: try if ($("checkbox").is(":checked"))
[07:47:20] <hooloovoo> well not really
[07:47:39] <hooloovoo> it would be $("input[type=checkbox]").is(":checked")
[07:47:43] <hooloovoo> i think
[07:48:21] <Chirag> its also not working
[07:49:10] <sacho> I still don't understand what condition you are talking about
[07:49:14] <sacho> do you have sample code?
[07:50:08] <Chirag> sacho I tried if($(":checkbox").prop("checked")) but it doesnt work.
[07:50:27] <sacho> why are you trying that?
[07:50:28] <kelye> is there a way to dynamically attack a new element in a sorted list ? using jquery ui
[07:50:29] <sacho> when are you trying it?
[07:50:45] <kelye> attach *
[07:51:51] <suedoh> just donated some money to the jquery foundation
[07:51:54] <suedoh> i feel proud of myself
[07:51:56] <Chirag> I want to check all checkboxes automatically(by jQuery) if checkbox of id 'all' is checked
[07:52:00] <Archer_xda> kelye - http://api.jquery.com/before/
[07:52:13] <Chirag> sacho did you get it?
[07:52:21] <hooloovoo> Chirag: that's a bit more work
[07:52:33] <Archer_xda> Chirag - make a jsfiddle so we can fix it for you - easier than working in here
[07:52:40] <Chirag> ok hooloovoo whats that?
[07:53:24] <hooloovoo> Chirag: try $("#all").on("change", function() { if($(this).is(":checked")) $("input").prop("checked", true); else $("input").prop("checked", false); })
[07:53:24] <kelye> Archer_xda: my problem is not appending/inserting the html
[07:53:39] <hooloovoo> Chirag: if that doesn't work, make a jsfiddle and i'll fix it there.
[07:53:57] <kelye> it's not acting as making part of the inital set of elements
[07:54:23] <kelye> let's say i have 2 UL's with items and i do $('ul').sortable()
[07:54:32] <Chirag> sacho thanks hooloovoo for your help. I am trying it
[07:54:43] <kelye> then i add with js another UL .. how do i make it work as sortable ?
[07:55:13] <kelye> one way i found is to call $(function() { $('ul').sortable() } after each change
[07:55:18] <kelye> but is there a better way ?
[07:56:17] <Archer_xda> kelye - I guess your issue is that you want to push a new option without having to sort again - yes?
[07:56:37] <kelye> yes
[07:56:46] <Chirag> hooloovoo
[07:56:51] <hooloovoo> kelye: try the refresh method
[07:56:54] <hooloovoo> it's in the docs
[07:57:08] <hooloovoo> Chirag
[07:57:08] <Chirag> thanks buddy for your help. It worked. :)
[07:57:13] <hooloovoo> no problemo =)
[07:57:21] <Archer_xda> kelye - $("#selectID option[value='xxx']).before()
[07:57:23] <Archer_xda> (or after)
[07:58:17] <Archer_xda> kelye - if it's jqueryui then ignore me - I'm talking about selects
[07:58:27] <kelye> yes, figured out that :)
[07:58:33] <kelye> and yes, it's about UI
[08:03:25] <kelye> hooloovoo: from the docs that should be the method..
[08:03:29] <kelye> but it's not working
[08:03:49] <kelye> i'll stick to the $(function () {} )approach for the moment
[08:04:06] <hooloovoo> kelye: you're adding it to the list and then it doesn't add it to the sortable when you refresh?
[08:04:19] <kelye> yes
[08:04:32] <hooloovoo> weird. try making a bug report or something.
[08:07:52] <j_ayen_green> I have <div id=x> ul li a ul li a.  I want to select only the parent links. So I have var parents=$(#x).find(a).not(#x ul ul a) but it returns children and parents.
[08:09:18] <JAAulde> j_ayen_green: $('#x > ul > li > a')
[08:09:34] <Archer_xda> j_ayen_green - $("#x > ul > li > a")
[08:09:37] <Archer_xda> heh
[08:10:02] <Archer_xda> j_ayen_green - > in a selector means not to look for children
[08:10:33] <j_ayen_green> Archer_xda: ohhh. Thanks! :) and you too JAAulde
[08:10:51] <JAAulde> j_ayen_green: n/p
[08:10:52] <j_ayen_green> out of curiosity. shouldn't the other work?
[08:12:38] <erikwebb> Does anyone know a good 1.3-compatible select->autocomplete plugin similar to Chosen?
[08:12:43] <JAAulde> j_ayen_green: i dunno...apparently not...? :P
[08:12:48] <johnline> http://jsfiddle.net/sCLN9/
[08:12:52] <Archer_xda> j_ayen_green - it may need the full selector in there, so not("#x ul li a ul li a") - it can be temperamental like that
[08:13:06] <Archer_xda> j_ayen_green - Not saying that 100% - just my first guess
[08:13:08] <johnline> having difficulty with the way i've done this menu :z
[08:13:37] <j_ayen_green> Archer_xda: you mean jq/js is temperamental?? ;)  gotcha, thx
[08:14:34] <Archer_xda> j_ayen_green - The selectors when doing the kind of thing you're doing need to be very specifically correct.  Not very forgiving.  Similar to using nth-child
[08:14:42] <johnline> is it symantically more correct to have ul's nested inside a horizontal list like above, or to just have an array of horizontal ul's
[08:15:02] <kelye> hooloovoo: i
[08:15:10] <kelye> i'm doing something like  $portlet.prependTo('.column:first').hide().fadeIn(800, function() { $('.connectedSortable').sortable('refresh');})
[08:15:20] <kelye> that should work no ?
[08:15:24] <Lexflex3000> question: i have a table showing data, one column shows comments (pretty large). what i want to do is cutting them, and have a "more" link that dynamically expands the TD at hand. how would i tackle this?
[08:16:04] <j_ayen_green> Archer_xda: I seem not to get parents OR children links with that
[08:16:35] <j_ayen_green> wouldn't the first level links be children of the div?
[08:16:45] <Archer_xda> j_ayen_green - Like I said - first guess.  I always end up messing around for a while with things like that
[08:16:49] <NoiseEee> Lexflex3000: you might consider something like: <td>Oh yeah, etc etc <a>more</a><span class='viewLater' style='display:none'>Oh this is going to appear and expand the cell when its shown</span></td>
[08:17:04] <NoiseEee> Lexflex3000: and basically a click on the a tag would show the sibling .viewLater
[08:17:10] <j_ayen_green> Archer_xda: I mean with the #x > ul > li > a
[08:18:05] <Archer_xda> j_ayen_green - Try changing to $("#x > ul li a")
[08:18:54] <Lexflex3000> NoiseEee: that is an idea, would mean though that i have to do the limiting within xslt (which i hate).. how would i implement this with jquery that only the span next to the link is showed, and not all spans?
[08:19:26] <NoiseEee> Lexflex3000: .siblings('.viewLater')
[08:21:14] <granden> I'm I doing it so f**king wrong I can or might I have any other bug. But  $("#bvImg2 img.activeT2") would that be a correct selector for all elements of the type img with class activeT2 that is childs of #bvImg2 ?
[08:21:44] <Lexflex3000> NoiseEee: sounds good. I guess i can attach that to all more links at once, since they are rendered dynamically, no? like $('.moreLink') (and then say onclick show siblings..)
[08:24:18] <Lexflex3000> does anyone know how to re-structure messed up html code in sublime text 2? its formatted totally unreadable
[08:26:52] <NoiseEee> Lexflex3000: something like $('#tableID').on('click','a.moreLink',function(ev) { var a = $(ev.target);  a.siblings('.viewLater').show(); });
[08:27:26] <NoiseEee> Lexflex3000: that would let future dynamically rendered <a>s have the functionality as well
[08:28:03] <Lexflex3000> NoiseEee, wait, the more-link is only rendered once, when the page loads
[08:28:30] <NoiseEee> Lexflex3000: so its up to you, certainly you can just $('a.moreLink').on('click',<etc>)
[08:28:47] <NoiseEee> and then just this.siblings('.viewLater').show()
[08:28:56] <Lexflex3000> NoiseEee: ah ok.. i am going to try that. sounds good
[08:32:20] <fission6> any recs on how to expand text in a 'show more' functionality
[08:34:10] <granden> Can I check keyboard inputs, like ESC key if that is pressed and then run a jquery function on that?
[08:34:18] <NoiseEee> fission6: please to read above, Lexflex3000's problem/solution
[08:36:36] <riskyshenanigan> anyone give tips on what types of things to practice javascript/jquery on for a beginner that wants to learn more advanced areas? Also besides the uses of interface, cookies what else are those technologies used for?
[08:39:01] <shoky> riskyshenanigan: lately many people use javascript on server-side too
[08:39:36] <riskyshenanigan> could you give some examples for use on server side?
[08:40:05] <shoky> anything you'd like to do oon a server. like anything php or ruby could do
[08:40:36] <riskyshenanigan> oh i see, cos i am currently a junior front-end dev, but am rusty on the javascript stuff
[08:40:44] <shoky> a specific example is: you could insert stuff into a database
[08:41:00] <riskyshenanigan> oh u mean like json
[08:41:05] <shoky> no
[08:41:12] <shoky> any data, to any database
[08:42:04] <shoky> with javascript code
[08:42:11] <shoky> running on node.js for example
[08:42:57] <riskyshenanigan> thanks ill look into that
[08:43:18] <shoky> well if yer rusty in javascript you should stick to front-end for now probably
[08:43:30] <shoky> until you feel you've god a good grip there
[08:43:32] <shoky> got*
[08:53:18] <fission6> if i want to offer the user varius input boxes then serialize them into a single model field would i subclass MultiWidget?
[08:54:45] <shoky> wat's dat
[08:54:55] <jeax> anyone in here familiar with Rails in addition to jQuery?
[08:56:08] <Lexflex3000> NoiseEee: your solution works like a charm!! now i only have to find a way to cut and render this with xslt... man jQuery is totally awesome!
[08:57:16] <Lexflex3000> NoiseEee: is there any way to do the show-process with a transition? like fade or slide or something?
[08:58:58] <NoiseEee> Lexflex3000: http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/ iirc, never used them though
[09:01:37] <aismail> hi everyone, I'm trying to redirect the current page
[09:01:41] <aismail> to a new one
[09:01:48] <aismail> it seems that window.location.href = new_location doesn't take effect immediately
[09:01:53] <aismail> can I prevent that somehow?
[09:02:17] <shoky> you can't redirect more immediately than that
[09:02:39] <systemfaultw> Upgrade your internet connection :D
[09:03:14] <aismail> no, I mean
[09:03:21] <aismail> there is some Javascript on the current page executed
[09:03:27] <aismail> even after window.location.href = new_location
[09:03:48] <shoky> which
[09:03:59] <aismail> I have some code like this
[09:04:18] <shoky> (dont paste here if its more than one line)
[09:04:25] <aismail> http://pastebin.com/gbXSttFR
[09:04:49] <aismail> refreshCurrentUser detects a 401 unauthorized HTTP request for the current user
[09:05:02] <aismail> and performs a window.location.href = 'login' (or smth like that)
[09:05:16] <aismail> then it seems that code like logger.level (...) still gets executed
[09:06:01] <shoky> it would only be executed if refreshCurrentUser calls the callback you gave it
[09:06:16] <aismail> it calls the callback
[09:06:23] <aismail> after performing window.location.href = new location
[09:06:27] <shoky> why would it do that
[09:06:34] <aismail> doesn't really matter why
[09:06:41] <aismail> the point is that code AFTER new href is set
[09:06:45] <aismail> is still executed
[09:07:57] <aismail> also, something very weird is happening
[09:08:02] <aismail> I print the href before and after
[09:08:05] <aismail> and it's the same thing
[09:08:23] <aismail> http://pastebin.com/tSRMHumW
[09:09:35] <shoky> you can't prevent the browser from running the code you give it, even if some of it is after the redirect.. that's up to the browser
[09:09:58] <aismail> yes, but it's not logical
[09:10:06] <aismail> and why does it display the same value twice?
[09:10:18] <shoky> because it hasn't really changed yet
[09:10:52] <bdiu> anyone interested in collaborating on a jquery form validation plugin?
[09:11:01] <shoky> location.href is up to the browser
[09:11:17] <bdiu> I have one written that I'm putting on github in a matter of minutes, but it has a few bugs and I'm trying to put together a unit test suite for it as well
[09:11:31] <bdiu> it's purpose-built to work well with twitter bootstrap
[09:11:44] <shoky> we'd be happy to help you on those bugs ;p
[09:19:52] <Archer_xda> aismail - redirect does not stop execution.  You must simply use an else statement if you don't want code to run
[09:20:30] <Archer_xda> aismail - execution will stop when the new page starts to load, which could be any time after the redirect call is made
[09:22:53] <bdiu> here's the repo: https://github.com/bendalton/jqEZValidate
[09:24:35] <bdiu> basically i need to set up some demos and tests to verify expected outcomes and then fix the code... it looks like there is a small issue where it validates against the wrong fields
[09:24:51] <bdiu> it works as standalone js, but as a jquery plugin, it has some issues
[09:37:12] <fission6> any recs for infinite scroll functionality
[09:37:52] <NoiseEee> fission6: google "lazy loading javascript"
[09:46:23] <fission6> NoiseEee: thanks
[09:46:37] <fission6> is there a place to post a photo which exibits my issue
[09:57:01] <species> fission6: i got sick of all the image host sites doing bullshit so I started using dropbox to host images
[10:08:26] <mikebsmf> on my second line of js for $('#landing-wrapper div:first') the selection is not working and the div isnt showing up.  any help please http://jsfiddle.net/TWVSX/1/
[10:12:48] <shoky> bdiu: using 'this' like that when
[10:13:14] <shoky> bdiu: using 'this' like that when 'this' is just some jqobject , (e.g. adding this.options = smthing; ) won't work
[10:13:51] <shoky> if you wanna keep that data persistent on the elements, use .data(...)
[10:16:09] <shoky> coz if you have var v = $('form'); v.ezValidate(); ( which sets v.options to something )   then: var v2 = $('form')  on the same form is a totally different object
[10:16:16] <shoky> won't save the options or anythin
[10:19:34] <nebmo> okay so I'm nearly there... http://jsfiddle.net/P9StL/11/ when you test it on here it works perfectly (FireFox v13), but when I'm on my own website it, once it hits 0 characters left, it clears the whole textarea! :S
[10:20:03] <RonaldoMcDonald> Hey guys, do you know what might cause jquery to not load? i'm trying to use draggable but i'm getting a "method not found" exception in firebug
[10:20:25] <shoky> RonaldoMcDonald: only not loading it would do that..
[10:20:35] <shoky> RonaldoMcDonald: you get method not found where?
[10:20:52] <RonaldoMcDonald> shoky, but it's loading and the link is correct..
[10:20:53] <shoky> er also draggable is jquery UI
[10:21:00] <shoky> which isn't part of jquery
[10:21:14] <RonaldoMcDonald> shoky, hehe yea, jquery ui is on the page
[10:21:16] <EyePulp> looking for the selector for all elements that include a class starting with a particular string, e.g. ^foo - some elements have several classes, and the foo* class isn't necessarily the first listed.  Any simple method?
[10:21:27] <shoky> RonaldoMcDonald: show some code/a demo
[10:21:43] <ngharo> oh god i'm going crazy
[10:21:45] <ngharo> http://jsfiddle.net/ngharo/kZ8uB/1/
[10:21:50] <ngharo> if anyone has any pointers
[10:21:54] <ngharo> please, GOD PLEASE
[10:22:08] <RonaldoMcDonald> shoky, just figured it out. i commented out jquery.tools which i was using for tabs and it's conflicting
[10:22:45] <shoky> ah
[10:23:42] <RonaldoMcDonald> guess I have to use noConflict then?
[10:24:30] <shoky> i donno what names/methods jquery tools uses so no idea
[10:24:49] <shoky> noConflict is just for $
[10:28:33] <JRGould> ngharo, I'm guessing that jqui doesn't take into account the scaling
[10:29:09] <ngharo> yes, I think you're right.  I've been poking at $.ui.position source for hours
[10:29:11] <ngharo> with no success
[10:29:49] <JRGould> ngharo: you'd have to double the 'left' property since those pixels are being halved, but your canvas is staying the same size
[10:30:00] <JRGould> actually… not even that
[10:30:09] <JRGould> because it doesn't account for the scaling of the box
[10:30:37] <JRGould> you'd have to do the math yourself, taking into account the scale factor and reposition it
[10:30:55] <ngharo> can i do that in "userland" or would i be hacking jqui source?
[10:32:03] <JRGould> if you can tell your script when the scaling is occurring you could run whatever algorithm you come up with to reposition the box as a callback to the box opening - I'm pretty sure jqui offers a callback for that
[10:35:41] <granden> How do I style a jquery ui element individually? I got two differently elements to style, one element is a button the other one a range slider.
[10:35:50] <poppiez> I'm creating a slideshow with images around 700x1000 px. it works great. however, rather fast, the browser memory usage spikes and takes up 500-600 mb. any way to free memory?
[10:35:53] <granden> But are both on the same side.
[10:35:55] <ngharo> JRGould: roger that.  thanks
[10:37:34] <Whirl3d> how do I check to see if an item is in an array? I thought I could indexOf...
[10:38:18] <systemfault> Whirl3d, .indexOf doesn't work on older browsers.. and it doesn't work with objects
[10:38:56] <Whirl3d> Is there an easy way other than looping through the entire array?
[10:39:32] <Whirl3d> actually, I just thought of a work around. Thanks for the reply systemfault
[10:39:42] <systemfault> Not really.. if the array was sorted, you could use binary search...
[10:39:57] <systemfault> Ah ok, good :D
[10:41:02] <_trev> Just implement indexOf :P
[10:45:32] <shoky> poppiez: if you remove the image elements not being shown and not leaking anything there's not much else you can do. if a modern browser has 500-600 mb to itself, and it's in no rush to free it, there's no reason to
[10:46:28] <chilversc> the other thing to remember, is that 500-600 might be working set, rather than private bytes, so it could just have the file memory mapped from the hdd or something
[10:46:46] <shoky> ya bottom point is the browser is a better memory manager than you
[10:46:52] <shoky> just dont leak stuff and you'll be fine
[10:47:50] <poppiez> shoky: million dollar question: how can I tell if I leak?
[10:48:03] <shoky> memory profile and shit like that
[10:48:08] <shoky> chrome makes it (sorta) easy
[10:52:11] <shoky> poppiez: also, what happens after that spike?
[10:52:55] <poppiez> shoky: stays there
[10:53:11] <poppiez> in IE that is
[10:53:37] <shoky> well i wouldn't dare to guess what IE does with its memory :P
[10:55:49] <shoky> poppiez also if you jsfiddle/pastebin your slideshow code you could get some free-mass-code-review
[10:57:38] <poppiez> shoky: I appreciate it. will try to investigate and report back :)

[11:01:19] <hobbit> why?
[11:01:46] <karolyi> if i defined it like this $.widget('a.b.c', {}), how will i reac it?
[11:01:53] <karolyi> +h
[11:02:26] <gnarf> karolyi: I haven't ever tried, I've only ever seen namespaces with one level
[11:02:31] <gnarf> I suggest sticking with it
[11:02:39] <gamingdroid> I'm looking for a commonly use slideshow i.e. well supported by the community. Any suggestions?
[11:02:44] <gnarf> cuz it proabbly ends up with jQuery[ "a.b" ].c
[11:03:34] <karolyi> gnarf: well thats a little odd, because i'll have loads of widgets, it would be better to have a well built namespace for it
[11:03:52] <gnarf> karolyi: so, "mycompany.widgetname" isn't enough?
[11:04:46] <karolyi> gnarf: actually there's a possibility of putting a widget within a widget, so , it'd be better to name it as such
[11:04:59] <gnarf> um
[11:05:16] <Whirl3d> This is gonna sound stupid, but I just wanted to check: if I grab an array from the data object of an element and modify the array, I have to refresh the data object, right? in other words: var subs=elem.data('subs'); subs=[]; console.log(elem.data("subs")=original array)
[11:05:38] <gnarf> karolyi: mycompany.widgetnameSubwidget
[11:05:42] <MrPunkin> Okay, so I have an external script file that I don't actually have control over the code and i need to use it… yet it uses the default $() for query, and a good chunk of our app is still legacy Prototype code using $. I need access to both, so is there a way without having access to the query script file to make its functions reference my compatibility-safe variable of $j instead?
[11:06:06] <karolyi> gnarf: that's a way too :)
[11:06:23] <gnarf> MrPunkin: jQuery = jQuery.noConflict()
[11:06:46] <gnarf> MrPunkin: (function( $ ) { put code that needs $ = jQuery inside here })( jQuery )
[11:06:49] <MrPunkin> gnarf: right, but all the script file is written as $(whatever) and I can't change that code to say jQuery() whatever
[11:07:05] <gnarf> MrPunkin: wrap your jQuery = $ code in the closure
[11:07:05] <MrPunkin> gnarf: can I query the external js file within a function block like that? I can't can I?
[11:07:22] <gnarf> you should never assume $ = jQuery
[11:07:35] <gnarf> at least when working with external code
[11:07:36] <gnarf> :)
[11:07:46] <karolyi> anyway, jquery's great, using it since the beginning
[11:07:49] <MrPunkin> the developer of the external code used $() all over the place
[11:07:52] <MrPunkin> assuming jquery
[11:08:09] <gnarf> MrPunkin: then tell him to fix his broken shit to work in noConflict() mode
[11:08:20] <gnarf> because its REALLY easy to do
[11:08:31] <gnarf> just put your shit in a closure, even UI does this
[11:09:19] <gnarf> MrPunkin: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.mouse.js#L13
[11:09:19] <MrPunkin> gnarf: so short of him changing the code, I'm out of luck then?
[11:09:29] <gnarf> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/ui/jquery.ui.mouse.js#L166
[11:09:43] <gnarf> MrPunkin: let me make sure I have the facts right before I confirm
[11:10:09] <gnarf> MrPunkin: You are including an "external script" which assumes $ = jQuery, but you have $j = jQuery.noConflict() ?
[11:10:25] <gnarf> this "external script" is loaded from a server you don't have control over
[11:10:58] <gnarf> and you can't use your own version of his script file -- .. I.E. wrap it yourself and save the file on your local host
[11:11:39] <MrPunkin> gnarf: I could re-write it myself, so I guess that is an option. I may do that in the meantime. Just means it won't update as the plugin updates. Its a rails Gem that has it's own script files
[11:11:48] <gnarf> if all those things are true, then yes - you're SOL, and should submit a pull request / issue ticket to the author of this external library that is so naive about jQuery best practice
[11:12:05] <granden> Anyone who could help me how to make a custom styles for my buttons and range-slider?
[11:13:08] <gnarf> MrPunkin: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[11:13:31] <gnarf> notice in the first section it basically says, don't use the dollar unless you use the IIFE
[11:13:59] <MrPunkin> gnarf: Right. The guy is on IRC that authored it so I'm sure he can change it real soon
[11:14:27] <gnarf> MrPunkin: awesome - yeah its like 2 lines of code that gives you about 99% protection vs noConflict() scenarios
[11:18:21] <Whirl3d> why is the method signature for .proxy so weird?
[11:20:18] <systemfault> Because the jquery creator is weird..
[11:20:25] <systemfault> (Possbility)
[11:20:38] <Whirl3d> ah, the old faith initiative...i see...
[11:20:56] <systemfault> Whirl3d, jQuery has a few weird functions...
[11:21:05] <systemfault> proxy grep each map...
[11:21:18] <Whirl3d> I see mention of "the event subsystem" is there any way to tap into that?
[11:21:59] <Whirl3d> I am trying to create a publsh/subscribe system that will allow for "plugins" to attach themselves to other plugins through event publication
[11:22:16] <systemfault> Whirl3d, cute
[11:22:30] <systemfault> jQuery supports custom events just fine
[11:22:39] <systemfault> If that's what you want to know
[11:23:17] <Whirl3d> I'm good with that, so I just need to use .on with context and custom events....(I think shoky showed me how the other day)...
[11:23:38] <poppiez> I have a build script that concatenates, minifies and gzips JS+CSS. this works in all browsers, but IE9 and down can't handle it. all the JS+CSS is scrambled and I gets errors across the board because it can't interpret it. why is that?
[11:23:51] <poppiez> because of the gzipping, that is
[11:24:19] <fourlastor> poppiez, instead of gzipping it manually use an apache module if you can
[11:24:28] <Whirl3d> I'll post what I've got and I would love your input systemfault...no pressure or obligation, just if you get a chance. bbl
[11:24:36] <systemfault> Whirl3d, :)
[11:24:41] <poppiez> fourlastor: I'd rather not. I don't want to gzip on the fly
[11:25:12] <fourlastor> poppiez, i have an intensive-working server with that and it doesn't make much problems :P
[11:26:25] <poppiez> fourlastor: well, I want to do it before-hand
[11:27:04] <fourlastor> poppiez, then you could try finding the browser and having both a gzipped version and a plain version
[11:27:43] <systemfault> who the hell gzip their JS and CSS?
[11:27:49] <systemfault> Let the server do it...
[11:28:23] <poppiez> systemfault: I'm doing it in my build script to avoid overhead
[11:28:40] <systemfault> poppiez, There's no overhead.
[11:28:55] <systemfault> CPU time is cheap... and you have plenty of it, IO is the problem...
[11:29:09] <poppiez> systemfault: I'm using amazon s3 so they have to be gzipped when uploaded. amazon doesn't do that for you
[11:29:26] <fourlastor> poppiez, try checking the accept_encoding header (in the $_SERVER variable in php)
[11:29:29] <systemfault> poppiez, I didn't know that.. weird :(
[11:29:47] <fission6> $('<h3>hi</h3><div>whatever</div>').find('h3') why does this not find the h3 element
[11:30:06] <jedimind_> because thats not a selector?
[11:30:25] <fission6> what isnt?
[11:30:36] <fission6> i thought i could load html like that
[11:30:38] <fourlastor> poppiez, if they send you they accept gzip then you can gzip it
[11:30:40] <tdskate> var array = [ 'zero', 'one', 'two'];  how can I find out at which position the string 'one' is in the array?
[11:31:22] <fission6> tdskate: checkout undersore.js
[11:31:25] <systemfault> fission6, you would use .siblings
[11:31:29] <poppiez> fourlastor: can't seem to find any accept encoding header
[11:31:44] <fourlastor> poppiez, give me a minute
[11:32:05] <poppiez> fourlastor: it isn't set
[11:32:08] <fourlastor> HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING
[11:32:18] <fourlastor> i didn't remember the name well
[11:32:21] <poppiez> yeah, not there but is in e.g. firefox
[11:32:31] <fourlastor> not in ie 9?
[11:32:31] <poppiez> http://forums.asp.net/t/800050.aspx/1
[11:32:35] <fourlastor> well use empty
[11:32:40] <fourlastor> it checks for being set too
[11:32:46] <tdskate> fission6: can't be done with jQuery? :(
[11:33:25] <fourlastor> if(!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING'] && find_the_gzip_encoding)) { // gzip it }
[11:33:35] <systemfault> ?eval var array = [ 'zero', 'one', 'two']; $.inArray(array, 'one');
[11:33:37] <NoiseEee> tdskate: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[11:33:38] <bot-t> systemfault: -1
[11:33:47] <fission6> systemfault: you are right, but now i run into another problem - i need to remove it, maybe i should have just said that first
[11:33:50] <systemfault> ?eval var array = [ 'zero', 'one', 'two']; $.inArray('one', array);
[11:33:50] <bot-t> systemfault: 1
[11:33:53] <systemfault> :D
[11:33:57] <systemfault> tdskate, $.inArray
[11:34:01] <tdskate> systemfault: very nice ! thank you !
[11:34:07] <fission6> $('<h3>hi</h3><div>whatever</div>') <- need to remove the first <h3> element
[11:34:26] <fourlastor> poppiez, if(!empty($_SERVER['HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING'] && find_the_gzip_encoding)) { // gzip it } (didn't quote you)
[11:34:27] <fission6> getting html through ajax (yes its ugly)
[11:34:34] <systemfault> fission6, $('<h3>hi</h3><div>whatever</div>').siblings('h3').remove() ?
[11:35:27] <Whirl3d> if I store a reference to an jquery-wrapped element in an array, can I later check to see if array[3]==$(source) ?
[11:36:04] <fission6> doesnt work systemfault
[11:36:45] <NoiseEee> fission6: var tmp = $('<div>');
[11:36:53] <poppiez> fourlastor: I only have one gzipped file on amazon s3, which is gzipped
[11:36:54] <fission6> ?
[11:37:19] <fourlastor> poppiez, cache a non-gzipped one too, in the case you need to serve it non-gzipped..
[11:37:32] <NoiseEee> fission6: var tmp = $('<div>'); tmp.html('<h3>hi</h3><div>whatever</div>');  tmp.find('h3').remove();  console.log(tmp.html());
[11:37:36] <poppiez> fourlastor: but my content/html is gzipped, which works great
[11:37:37] <systemfault> fission6, $('<h3>hi</h3><div>whatever</div>').slice(1) would work
[11:37:39] <poppiez> CSS+JS doesn't tho
[11:37:41] <poppiez> makes no sense
[11:37:56] <ciss> hi
[11:38:01] <fourlastor> poppiez, had ie* ever made sense? :P
[11:38:19] <someprimetime> what's the deal with data() vs. attr()? in terms of getting and setting values… should data() only be used when setting data as say maybe a callback of an ajax function or something similar?
[11:38:27] <fourlastor> they tricked js benchmarks with ie10, to appear more performant : \
[11:38:35] <systemfault> ...
[11:38:45] <systemfault> IE10's JS engine is performant...
[11:38:54] <systemfault> (Even if it's not as performant as V8)
[11:39:02] <NoiseEee> poppiez: have your SERVER gzip js and css
[11:39:03] <someprimetime> sacho_: i'll continue this here i guess?
[11:39:27] <fourlastor> systemfault, i heard it was manly during benchmarks and it looked like it was made to _appear_ performant
[11:39:43] <systemfault> someprimetime, .data is to associate 'data' to a node, it can be anything including an object.     .attr is to modify/get the value of HTML attributes of a node, it can only be a string.
[11:39:54] <someprimetime> i know you can't go like $('#whatever').data('foo', 'bar'); without having <div data-foo="">
[11:39:55] <systemfault> fourlastor, It doesn't make sense...
[11:40:19] <someprimetime> systemfault: ahh ok
[11:40:21] <systemfault> fourlastor, if that's the case... Mozilla and Google would also use that 'optimization'
[11:40:44] <fission6> ok thanks i have a patch for nopw
[11:41:05] <cloke> is there an easy way to specify a "root" json attribute for jquery ui widgets? autocomplete for example expects an array, but some web services return the data as {some_root: []}
[11:41:20] <fourlastor> systemfault, honestly it wouldn't surprise me too much, m$ used similar tricks with their search engine, taking infos from google
[11:42:16] <systemfault> fourlastor, stealing data is one thing... faking performance is another and much more difficult.
[11:42:23] <systemfault> Only nvidia does it :P
[11:42:30] <fourlastor> systemfault, i'm searching for the source :P
[11:42:55] <Sevein> hey guys, can you reproduce this weird issue in Chrome where I get 0 items for options:enabled?
[11:42:58] <Sevein> http://jsfiddle.net/6gTFu/5/
[11:43:05] <Sevein> I get 2 items in FF
[11:43:08] <sssilver> Hello gentlemen. Anyone has experience with jstree?
[11:43:19] <fission6> also if i am getting html from an ajax call and injecting into dom, how to a bind certain events to the new content - if i already bound to similr selectors but the new DOM content has more of them?
[11:43:30] <fission6> can i just rebind to every selector or would htat bind twice
[11:43:38] <fourlastor> systemfault, http://digitizor.com/2010/11/17/internet-explorer-9-caught-cheating-in-sunspider-benchmark/
[11:43:43] <fourlastor> that's not the only one of course
[11:43:48] <fourlastor> just googled the first result
[11:43:58] <NoiseEee> Sevein: http://jsfiddle.net/6gTFu/6/
[11:43:59] <fourlastor> and it was ie9, my bad
[11:44:20] <NoiseEee> Sevein: sorry f that
[11:44:51] <systemfault> fourlastor, Dead code elimination is a legit optimization.
[11:44:56] <NoiseEee> Sevein: http://jsfiddle.net/6gTFu/7/ i added an option
[11:45:02] <Sevein> NoiseEee: wow, cool, also just saw the ticket 11872
[11:45:09] <Sevein> greaaat :)
[11:45:14] <Sevein> NoiseEee: thank you so much
[11:45:23] <NoiseEee> nop
[11:45:53] <systemfault> Man... people take jsperf too seriously..
[11:46:15] <fourlastor> systemfault, yeah but it failed on the 2 additions :P
[11:47:07] <fourlastor> Whirl3d, i was searching infos about inheritance for jquery plugins, been told you were searching for something similar, did you find any solution?
[11:47:58] <fission6> is there a standard means of binding certain events to objects that are injected newly into the dom, i know there is 'live' but doubt thats preferred
[11:49:11] <NoiseEee> fission6: using .on() on a parent element.   $('#parentID').on('click','.certainClass',function() { alert('omg, i was clicked even when added to the DOM after loaded!!');})
[11:49:45] <fission6> interesting
[11:49:56] <fission6> ok, so pick a parent whos content changes
[11:51:10] <fission6> NoiseEee: is that right?
[11:51:26] <NoiseEee> fission6: pick a parent that will hold all the existing/newly added particular content
[11:52:05] <fission6> ok
[11:52:07] <fission6> let me try
[11:53:54] <fission6> uUncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'on'
[11:54:05] <fission6> $('div.content').on('submit','form.comment-form', function(event) {
[11:54:25] <systemfault> fission6, what version of jquery are you using?
[11:54:47] <systemfault> You need 1.7 for .on
[11:54:52] <fission6> 1.6.2
[11:54:53] <fission6> ok
[11:55:29] <fission6> ill update and cross my fingers its backwards combatible with what ive build over the last ur
[11:55:31] <fission6> yr
[11:57:15] <ckoning> Will event listeners be unbound automatically when the DOM element they are attached to is removed from the page?
[11:58:20] <fission6> okay systemfault and NoiseEee updateed got rid of the error - but event binding doesn't seem to work for newly injected content
[11:58:37] <catcher> ckoning, I'd say it depends on whether the event listener is delegated. If so, it'll be re-bound when the object shows back up.
[11:58:50] <catcher> ckoning, i.e. with .on()
[11:59:23] <fission6> the .on('submit', ... does seem to work for the initial content
[12:03:07] <NoiseEee> fission6: whats the line
[12:04:50] <fission6> ok i got it!
[12:04:52] <fission6> nice
[12:05:00] <fission6> this was great thanks NoiseEee and systemfault
[12:05:08] <NoiseEee> np fission6
[12:08:04] <ckoning> @catcher Thanks, I will look into that. I'm just doing a straight bind right now.
[12:11:08] <KWhat_Work> curser position
[12:11:50] <gadlol> Hi is there a way to reorder an element of a parent div? For example: $('#sibling5').orderUp() or orderDown()
[12:12:09] <KWhat_Work> Lets try that in question form,  does jquery have cursor position functions for moving the cursor in a textbox?
[12:14:27] <ezakimak> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/512528/set-cursor-position-in-html-textbox
[12:23:16] <avandenhoven> I need a recommendation. I need to do one of those annoying "sign up for our newsletter" dialogs and I'm hoping there is a plugin that manages things like "never show this again", ideally showing on the first page view of a session.
[12:25:52] <systemfault> Just use a cookie
[12:27:20] <avandenhoven> systemfault: I know that I can write it myself. I'm asking if this is a solved problem for which a plugin already exists.
[12:29:09] <ravenzz> you can use js to set a cookie, but it would be better to do that server side
[12:29:24] <systemfault> How is it better?
[12:29:46] <ravenzz> at least you set the correct one
[12:31:53] <ravenzz> I mean maybe in this case doesn't matter whether he set it server side or not
[12:33:15] <systemfault> Adding a column in the database for a stupid flag..
[12:33:21] <systemfault> It beyond stupid IMHO.
[12:33:42] <Whirl3d> fourlastor, sorry for the delayed response. Lemme look up the link I used as reference...brb

[12:56:22] <Soleino^> Which jquery addon can you recommand to me for a form>select customisation, something good and light
[12:56:27] <JRGould> jj222: $(".myform").on('click focus', function(e){ $('.myAutoCompleteElement').focus();});
[12:56:31] <JRGould> or something like that
[12:57:22] <jj222-> alright here goes
[12:57:23] <jj222-> thanks
[12:58:00] <JRGould> Soleino^:  I hear good things about jqTransforms
[13:00:09] <jj222-> JRGould: This is my first and last time touching jquery... I'm use to PHP\MYSQL ugh... I know I messed this up ... http://pastebin.com/dH0Wnqru
[13:00:17] <jj222-> the ID is Tags

[13:01:32] <JRGould> use jsfiddle.net instead to make a simplest scenario test environment that we can actually interact with.
[13:01:47] <JRGould> it's too hard to just look at something and see if it might work
[13:02:25] <jj222-> alright
[13:03:01] <shoky> jj222- http://jsfiddle.net/zH7Rc/
[13:03:22] <shoky> ah doesn't work the first time
[13:05:06] <jj222-> thanks :)
[13:05:32] <jj222-> hah it works the second time
[13:05:50] <jj222-> beats not at all :P
[13:07:51] <widoz> hi
[13:07:59] <widoz> someone use jcarousel?

[13:11:30] <aberrant> hi - quick question. If I have a div id of "cl-11", how do I extract the "11" out of it?
[13:12:18] <aberrant> n/m, got it :)
[13:14:23] <JRGould> jj222-:  I can't figure out what event triggers the opening of the autocomplete
[13:15:48] <jj222-> :\
[13:16:11] <DerekPioneer> i have a "view more" link that toggles some content. once it's clicked i want it to change to "view less". once it's clicked again i want it to change back to "view more". all of this works fine, but only the first time it happens. http://jsfiddle.net/A4nTt/1/
[13:16:33] <DerekPioneer> after i click "view less" and the text changes back to "view more", when i click "view more" again the text will never change again
[13:16:46] <DerekPioneer> what's the best way to implement something like this? i know it's a common thing
[13:17:08] <jj222-> Someone said this, but I have no idea what it means: $('#myButton').click(function() {$('#autocomplete').trigger("focus"); //or "click", at least one should work});
[13:17:23] <jj222-> This worked PERFECTLY! I changed a little, and on my input element put onfocus="javascript:$(this).autocomplete('search','');" . Thanks for the help!
[13:17:28] <jj222-> But I just know nothing about javascript :P
[13:17:32] <jj222-> php\mysql only ;p
[13:17:57] <jj222-> maybe putting it on the form will work?
[13:18:22] <jj222-> <input style="color: #f95d75" id="tags" name="accountto" id="accountto" type="text"   value="">         is my form
[13:19:24] <jj222-> yeah that worked cool
[13:19:38] <jj222-> I hope it works for all browsers

[13:28:02] <Nebukadneza> when reading into jquerys ajax functionality i couldn't find anything that'd help me ... is my idea wrong, have i overlooked something...?
[13:28:43] <thetallguy> anyone familiar with how to run initialization code for an ajax loaded page in jquery-ui.tabs?
[13:29:33] <thetallguy> I find conflicting information about whether to embed the scripts in the loaded content, whether to wrap in a jquery ready, etc.
[13:30:19] <thetallguy> it seems a callback off of the load function is the standard way if you do it yourself, but I haven't found how to do that with the tabs widget
[13:32:42] <Daghdha> Hi. I was writing some code and i based it on the notion i can select arrays by name with jquery. A misconception i fear
[13:33:04] <Daghdha> Is it possible to have jquery find an array by name?
[13:33:28] <NoiseEee> find an array by name? what does taht mean?
[13:33:29] <mooijk> what do you mean?
[13:33:30] <Daghdha> e.g this array:  var ArrayLIC7PIT1= { min: "1", max: "1", price: "3999"};
[13:33:45] <Nebukadneza> hm, noone? ;/
[13:33:53] <Daghdha> aAnd selector i had was $("[id^=Array" + id + "PIT]")
[13:34:08] <Daghdha> But that doesn't work for arrays
[13:34:18] <NoiseEee> Daghdha: yeah selectors are for use on the DOM
[13:34:25] <Daghdha> Yeh, i was affraid of that
[13:34:39] <Daghdha> should i sue eval?
[13:34:43] <Daghdha> use
[13:34:53] <Nebukadneza> when exactly does a jQuery.ajax() request complete? when the server closes the connection? when the content-length sent by the server are exceeded
[13:35:06] <NoiseEee> Daghdha: i have no idea what you're trying to dom, but it smells funny
[13:35:14] <NoiseEee> Nebukadneza: you should look into socket.io
[13:35:17] <Brodingo> youd probably have a case if you sued eval
[13:35:27] <rwparris2> I have table and each <td> has a class 'node'.  Using jquerymovile, I'd like to keep track what "node" a touchstart event occurs on, and which one a touchend event occurs on.  this is what I have now: https://gist.github.com/2891382 .  the problem is the same node changes colors for both touchstart and touchend.
[13:35:27] <Daghdha> noise: I have 10 arrays, depending on an amount entered i pick one of the arrays.
[13:35:42] <Daghdha> But it has to be generic
[13:36:02] <Nebukadneza> NoiseEee: ah, thats another idea... ok
[13:36:06] <Daghdha> So i can't go making a switch or some if-then-else stuff
[13:36:37] <NoiseEee> Daghdha: var arraysIveMade = [];  var ArrayLIC7PIT1= { min: "1", max: "1", price: "3999"}; //ps, not an array;   arraysIveMade.push(ArrayLIC7PIT1);    and you can "search" through arraysIveMade i guess
[13:36:42] <sacho_> Daghdha, var container = { 'objLICP7PIT1' : { min: "1" max: "1", price: "3999" } }
[13:36:52] <NoiseEee> Daghdha: but like i said... there is a smell coming from the code you're suggesting
[13:36:58] <Nebukadneza> but ... websockets aren't supported by many browsers, so i'd rather like to use something well supported, NoiseEee... :/
[13:37:09] <Daghdha> My code is like the queens poo.
[13:37:13] <relipse> I am using jqueryui dialog, but it is REALLY BIG FONT and buttons, how can i make it look sleek like on the jqueryui demo site?
[13:37:14] <NoiseEee> Nebukadneza: socket.io degrades gracefully on the browsers that can't handle sockets
[13:37:22] <Nebukadneza> hm, to what?
[13:37:31] <NoiseEee> Nebukadneza: you can choose... flash, long polling...
[13:37:56] <Nebukadneza> long polling would require the connection to be re-setup every time a valid reply from the server comes, right?
[13:38:00] <Nebukadneza> or *can* it stay open?
[13:38:12] <Daghdha> How is it not an array?
[13:38:24] <NoiseEee> Daghdha: its an object.
[13:38:26] <sacho_> because it's a plain object, that's how
[13:38:32] <shoky> {} <-- object
[13:38:37] <shoky> [] <-- array
[13:38:39] <Daghdha> aha
[13:39:24] <shoky> and no you shouldn't use eval, ever
[13:40:00] <Daghdha> neval eval! Gotcha!
[13:40:19] <shoky> evileval
[13:41:45] <Nebukadneza> hm, can i even use socket.io with a arbitrary server? Oo the examples look kinda strange
[13:43:07] <NoiseEee> Nebukadneza: you need to set up node as a server
[13:43:14] <Nebukadneza> then it won't do for me :(
[13:43:19] <Nebukadneza> i have a python asynchat server
[13:43:49] <relipse> I have a problem, I am using jqueryui dialog, and in firefox you cannot move the dialog without it popping out of the page and messing up....i found a temporary solution of adding a whole bunch of <br />'s to the end of the page, is there a way to simulate the page taking up the whole window size no matter what (but not over so it doesnt add scrollbars?)
[13:44:03] <Daghdha> NoiseEee: Should i also add the objectname tot the fields? Like min,max, price and arrayname? Or is there another way to recognice it?
[13:46:21] <Daghdha> nvm, adding another ID wich will make it simple
[13:46:55] <sris> can the $.when accept an array of deffereds or does it have to be individual arguments?
[13:48:14] <shoky> sris you can use .apply :  $.when.apply($, arrayOfDefferds)
[13:48:29] <sris> shoky: cool, thanks!
[13:48:36] <dlirit> hey guys
[13:48:49] <shoky> hellow
[13:49:52] <teear> my momma was a j queeryfaary
[13:50:10] <Daghdha> everlasting
[13:50:14] <shoky> gayquery j
[13:50:57] <dlirit> i have a div that has inside another div, and so on, and the divs have texts inside. i tried calculating the height of how much 'pixels' the texts and buttons etc take with div_object.css('height') but it returns 0...
[13:51:03] <dlirit> just wondering if there's another way of doing that maybe
[13:51:45] <shoky> dlirit: try div_object.height()
[13:52:30] <dlirit> thats the next thing I tried after checking jquery apis but it fails too (gives me 0px)
[13:53:49] <Jon47> dlirit: make a fiddle?
[13:54:12] <dlirit> let me see how can i do that
[13:57:08] <dlirit> right, on fiddle it works
[13:57:18] <dlirit> I wonder why it doesn't on my full html+css+js
[13:57:24] <dlirit> think of any reason why that could be?
[14:01:53] <relipse> can someone please give me some ideas
[14:02:12] <relipse> firefox and jqueryui dialog do not work right unless I make the page bigger by adding a bunch of <br>'s
[14:04:32] <shoky> dlirit: what's the div's overflow ?
[14:04:48] <ciss> how do i retrieve all event handlers on an object for a custom namespaced event in jq 1.7.2? is there a better way than looping through $(el).data('events') ?
[14:04:51] <teear> Why do you have <br />:s when you could have <br>:s
[14:05:05] <shoky> ciss: no better way afaik
[14:05:57] <dlirit> shoky: the div doesn't have anything set for it in css
[14:06:31] <ciss> shoky: is there by any chance a utility function to filter an array of arbitrary objects by a property value?
[14:07:27] <shoky> ciss sure, $.grep
[14:08:35] <shoky> dlirit: even in the DOM inspector?
[14:08:43] <dlirit> right
[14:08:58] <shoky> dlirit: in the DOM inspector the height is 0?
[14:09:54] <ciss> shoky: right, thanks
[14:09:59] <dlirit> my bad, I thought you meant the css view
[14:10:05] <dlirit> in dom inspector its's about 360
[14:10:20] <shoky> of that same div_object ?
[14:11:35] <dlirit> yep
[14:12:29] <shoky> donno then ;P spot the differences between your fiddle and your local stuff ;P
[14:14:05] <dlirit> :)
[14:14:23] <teear> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGB1G0T9s_E
[14:14:40] <dlirit> i also console.loged' the grabbed object and it outputed everythin gok
[14:14:58] <ciss> dlirit: try to float the wrapper element that you test with .height()
[14:16:23] <Nebukadneza> urgh ... json does allow to specify designators using spaces, right? {"foo bar":15} ... but how do i access them?
[14:16:57] <ciss> Nebukadneza: obj['prop er ty']
[14:17:02] <Nebukadneza> ah, thanks ;P
[14:17:08] <Nebukadneza> (very new to js / jquery, sorry Oo)
[14:17:23] <ciss> Nebukadneza: not at all a problem :)
[14:17:25] <Nebukadneza> ahhhh, woohoo ;P
[14:17:44] <ciss> Nebukadneza: btw, same goes for numeric properties
[14:17:53] <Nebukadneza> ok
[14:18:07] <Nebukadneza> now i only need some kind of looper ... to loop over the entries in a more complex json structure
[14:18:11] <Nebukadneza> $.each?
[14:18:28] <shoky> yes plz
[14:18:47] <shoky> or maybe even $.map if that suits you
[14:19:14] <ciss> Nebukadneza: recursive?
[14:19:27] <Nebukadneza> would be sweet
[14:19:28] <Nebukadneza> *reading*
[14:21:02] <ciss> Nebukadneza: hint: arrays are passed by reference :)
[14:21:37] <Nebukadneza> ;P
[14:31:24] <kenneth> anybody used d3? i'm having a weird issue with removing things that fall out of the graph http://50.17.203.201:7332/index.html
[14:32:51] <shoky> ciss: also looking at the jquery events code, they're also just looping through the different events, no hidden utility method
[14:34:16] <shoky> e.g. when you call elem.off('.mynamespace')
[14:37:24] <ciss> shoky: very good to know, thanks. i ended up writing a small utility function.
[14:39:28] <shoky> nice ;>
[14:40:38] <donkeycongo> .click() still executes the redirect. How do I make it not?
[14:41:34] <shoky> donkeycongo: probably with event.preventDefault() if you're talking about a link..
[14:42:05] <LakWork> I never knew binding supported namespaces. that's fucking brilliant :O
[14:42:11] <LakWork> http://jsfiddle.net/aftVs/1/
[14:42:15] <Mekzholan> Hi, is there a traight foreward way to make a jQuery-UI slider to stay contained in it's "slidepath"? (The default goes like having the handle hang 50% over it on each end)
[14:43:00] <Mekzholan> So I need something like http://jqueryui.com/demos/slider/side-scroll.html - but that code looks very complicated...
[14:43:44] <donkeycongo> shoky: As in $(this).even...?
[14:44:24] <ciss> donkeycongo: function myHandler(event) { event.preventDefault(); }
[14:44:24] <shoky> donkeycongo:  $('a').click(function (event) { event.preventDefault();  ... more stuff ... })
[14:44:40] <someprimetime> what'd be the best way to only scroll a container within a mousedown?
[14:45:06] <donkeycongo> All right. Thanks, ciss, shoky.
[14:45:11] <someprimetime> $('#container').mousedown(function() { $('#container').scroll(size); }); }); but only during a mousedown
[14:45:55] <shoky> someprimetime: you mean to prevent scrolling by any other way?
[14:46:16] <ciss> someprimetime: create a timeout on mousedown, clear it on mouseup
[14:46:23] <someprimetime> shoky: sorta.. i have a div with overflow-y scroll on it and i only want to move it if a user clicks and drags the scrollbar
[14:46:30] <ciss> someprimetime: sorry, not timeout. i meant interval
[14:47:00] <ciss> someprimetime: in that case ignore my suggestion
[14:47:08] <someprimetime> ciss: ah alright
[14:48:13] <ciss> someprimetime: so basically you want to prevent scrolling by other means like the mousewheel?
[14:50:22] <shoky> dont think there's a way to do that that works in all browsers
[14:51:03] <shoky> except maybe changing the overflow on the fly if you wanna get hacky
[14:51:20] <ciss> isn't overflow-y a ie-only thing?
[14:51:50] <shoky> nope
[14:53:01] <ciss> can't believe i missed that it's now supported by all browsers ...
[14:53:52] <ciss> ah, wait. i confused it with background-position-y
[14:55:28] <shoky> ;p
[14:56:57] <shoky> Mekzholan: do tell if you find a simple way to do it
[14:57:53] <Mekzholan> shoky: hm, I was hoping there's an easy config option - or even better CSS...
[14:59:36] <shoky> i tried finding an easy css way but didnt find someth that looks easy. i gave up pretty quick tho ;P
[15:01:50] <gabeodess> Hey guys, I am trying to replace the contents of a <script> tag and can't seem to figure out how.  Can anyone help me with this?
[15:02:08] <eip56> Example are you trying to change the src?
[15:02:18] <gabeodess> $('script').html('new content') works in modern browsers, but seems to fail in IE8
[15:02:25] <acidjazz> lol wat gabeodess
[15:02:33] <gabeodess> eip56 yes
[15:02:41] <eip56> OK ... your doing it awrong
[15:02:51] <gabeodess> eip56: please help me
[15:03:25] <gabeodess> mind you, I am using the query tmpl plugin so I am trying to put HTML in a <script> tag.
[15:03:35] <eip56> $('script').attr('src','new value')
[15:04:05] <eip56> Ok maybe its just me but what exists in the document and what are you trying to change
[15:04:50] <gabeodess> eip56: sorry, no I don't want to change the src attribute, I want to change everything contained in between <script> and </script>
[15:05:20] <gabeodess> acidjazz: what did I say that was funny?
[15:05:38] <chilversc> gabeodess: what about .text("new content") instead?
[15:05:47] <ngharo> ?demo @ gabeodess
[15:05:49] <bot-t> gabeodess, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[15:08:06] <gabeodess> chilversc: tried that, get the same error: "Unexpected call to method or property access."
[15:08:19] <gabeodess> I'll put something together on jsfiddle
[15:08:24] <Whirl3d> I'm defining methods for a plugin by putting them in an object literal. Can I access one method from another inside the same object literal...{getCurrent:function () {do stuff, return current}, getNext:function () {var curr=getCurrent()}}  ?
[15:09:19] <shoky> Whirl3d: usually that's done with 'this.getCurrent()'
[15:09:47] <Whirl3d> even though at the time, "this" is the window
[15:10:04] <shoky> how come?
[15:10:29] <shoky> i mean, how're you calling getNext
[15:11:43] <Whirl3d> var gallery=new Gallery() {blah blah var methods={bunch o stuff} return methods}   while inside the contstructor, it's window, or doc so something.
[15:11:45] <shoky> or this might work too:  var methods = {a: fn, b: function() { var curr=methods.a() } }
[15:12:00] <Whirl3d> aha. that'sit'
[15:12:03] <chilversc> gabeodess: just looking at, http://forum.jquery.com/topic/unexpected-call-to-method-or-property-access-in-ie8
[15:12:08] <Whirl3d> thx
[15:12:11] <shoky> ;>
[15:12:17] <chilversc> gabeodess: have you tried loading modernizer in the HEAD before the rest of the document loads?
[15:12:59] <gabeodess> chilversc: Modernizr is loaded in the head.
[15:13:56] <chilversc> damn
[15:14:01] <gabeodess> chilversc: as far as I know, modernizer only tells me what's supported, it doesn't actually DO anything.
[15:14:47] <gabeodess> and I'm not quite sure how jsFiddle is supposed to work… not getting any output.
[15:15:03] <gabeodess> http://jsfiddle.net/DZQkj/
[15:15:03] <chilversc> gabeodess: no, modernizer does have a shim to ensure the new html5 elements are registered for older IEs
[15:15:06] <ciss> gabeodess: how about replaceWith()?
[15:15:25] <diverdude> Gmail has some functionality in the reciever field so that when a text field is filled up, it increases in size vertically, so that it becomes 2 lines instead of 1, then 3 and 4 etc. How can that be achieved?
[15:15:45] <gabeodess> ciss: I would still need to build the new script tag somehow...
[15:16:18] <gabeodess> what am I doing wrong here… not getting any output: http://jsfiddle.net/DZQkj/
[15:16:20] <chilversc> gabeodess: found this, but no real solution http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10237649/exception-occurs-in-ie8-when-dynamically-updating-knockoutjs-template
[15:16:39] <ciss> gabeodess: see if you can clone it and modify the cloned version while it's outside the dom
[15:17:08] <chilversc> gabeodess: have you tried without jquery, just a simple document.getElementById("...").innerText = "..."; ?
[15:17:38] <gabeodess> ciss: I already tried $('<script/>').html('test'), same error.
[15:18:21] <gabeodess> chilversc: I tried with innerHtml and it set's innerHtml but $().html() still returns the old template.
[15:18:58] <gabeodess> chilversc: can you tell me what I'm doing wrong with jsFiddle
[15:19:00] <gabeodess> ?
[15:21:13] <chilversc> gabeodess: nothing's wrong, I see the log in the console, you're just not doing anything with the script tag to produce output
[15:25:26] <chilversc> gabeodess: what if you do, $("<script></script>").text("test content") then replace the current element with that one?
[15:26:23] <gabeodess> chilversc: same error in IE8
[15:27:54] <ciss> gabeodess: have you tried wrapping it as cdata?
[15:28:16] <ciss> hm... nah. scratch that.
[15:28:36] <gabeodess> okay, here's my working example.
[15:28:39] <chilversc> gabeodess: I'm getting the impression ie8 doesn't support .appendChild on script tags
[15:28:41] <gabeodess> http://jsfiddle.net/DZQkj/
[15:28:44] <diverdude> Gmail has some functionality in the reciever field so that when a text field is filled up, it increases in size vertically, so that it becomes 2 lines instead of 1, then 3 and 4 etc. How can that be achieved?
[15:28:58] <chilversc> gabeodess: so what if you do; document.getElementById("foo").innerText = "Testing"; ?
[15:29:31] <chilversc> gabeodess: that or just do; var x = document.getElementById("foo"); and use the debugger to inspect what methods & properties x has
[15:29:37] <gabeodess> sorry, no, this is my example: http://jsfiddle.net/DZQkj/3/
[15:32:35] <gabeodess> chilversc: same error in IE8 http://jsfiddle.net/DZQkj/4/
[15:33:11] <chilversc> gabeodess: seems like IE8 doesn't support that then
[15:33:30] <chilversc> gabeodess: which roughly matches what results I see when googling
[15:33:31] <gabeodess> chilversc: hrm… okay, thanks for taking a look.
[15:33:41] * chilversc sees many questions, but no answers
[15:36:02] <shoky> gabeodess: http://jsfiddle.net/DZQkj/5/
[15:36:16] <chilversc> gabeodess: odd, according to this setting the innerText is the workaround http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10603
[15:36:55] <gabeodess> shoky:BAM!
[15:37:09] <gabeodess> shoky: that worked beautifully :)
[15:37:28] <shoky> ;p  20 min ago ciss said it already:  <ciss> gabeodess: how about replaceWith()?
[15:37:59] <gabeodess> shoky: yes, but you provided the missing link to make it work
[15:38:12] <shoky> heh ;>

[15:43:28] <relipse> ?

[15:50:05] <someprimetime> or $('#el').css('visibility', 'hidden');
[15:52:42] <RealityBall> hello
[15:53:36] <RealityBall> i was working on a jquery scrolling slideshow and I am having trouble figuring out how to get the slideshow to loop
[15:53:46] <RealityBall> http://pastebin.com/kKpJSFZb
[15:53:48] <raisman> Hi guys, how cain I match a pair of elements with the same class and make something to them? Like adding a border on hover for example? I set up this little fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/
[15:54:12] <raisman> Bah, didn't save it, here's the link. Sorry
[15:54:13] <raisman> http://jsfiddle.net/Pvvcx/
[15:55:12] <RealityBall> raisman, to select elements of the same class you would use $('.classname')
[15:55:49] <chilversc> raisman: I'm personally a fan of using ids for this rather than classes
[15:55:55] <Whirl3d> raisman, you can use CSS to do that. Simply add a :hover definition to your css for the class ...list:hover {border})
[15:56:06] <raisman> hmm
[15:56:11] <chilversc> raisman: trouble with classes is you have multiple values, so the first thing you need to do is find the which of the classes you care about
[15:56:15] <raisman> but that way i'll have to make a class for each element
[15:56:21] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Pvvcx/4/
[15:56:36] <Whirl3d> raisman, I just changed the bg color, you can add the border
[15:56:37] <raisman> since i want to match post-1 from the list item with post-1 from the div's
[15:56:48] <ragnok> hi, i learned js and now i'm doing jquery. along with learning, i'm trying many plugins, etc. if i want to ask something about an specific plugin, etc, is here the right place? or is there a channel only to discuss plugins usage, performance etc?
[15:57:22] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/YU4JM/ how come DOMMouseWheel isn't getting triggered in FF?
[15:57:30] <raisman> Like if I rollover post-1 list item i would like to target post-1 from the div list too
[15:57:41] <raisman> does that make any sense?
[15:59:32] <RealityBall> raisman, what exactly is your goal? when you rollover something what do you want to happen?
[15:59:54] <aaronELBorg> ok.....this should be an easy one but it's not.  I have a field that i need to "fake" a space bar keypress (and actually add a space as well).  anyone have a decent idea?  THANKS!
[16:01:09] <raisman> RealityBall: Basically if i rollover an element from the list item that has the same post-# class than the div's add a border to the element for example. My goal is to target both elements that have the same class not .list or .post but one from the list item's and one from the div's
[16:04:24] <aaronELBorg> no one wants to help a brother fake a space bar keypress?
[16:04:26] <chilversc> raisman: what about something like this? http://jsfiddle.net/Pvvcx/8/ ?
[16:04:28] <RealityBall> raisman, $('post-1') is how you would select all classes of post-1
[16:04:51] <mattp_> is there any way to hide an input without setting visibility:hidden?
[16:05:07] <raisman> chilversc: like that, but also changing the element that you're hovering
[16:05:24] <Whirl3d> raisman, here is one way to do it, but you are gonna have to change background color to border...
[16:05:35] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Pvvcx/12/
[16:05:37] <chilversc> raisman: um, chaning the element you're hovering over is the easy part, you can use either plain CSS, or its "this"
[16:05:56] <raisman> RealityBall: I would do something like $('.post-1'),css({ 'border' : '1px solid #ccc'} )
[16:06:28] <raisman> Whirl3d: That's exactly what i wanted to do!
[16:06:51] <raisman> let me see if I understand what you did there
[16:07:21] <raisman> chilversc: check out Whirl3d example, that's the thing I was planning to do hehe. Was a bit hard to explain
[16:07:36] <chilversc> raisman: yeah, I personally prefer to be a bit more explicit, hence the data-target attribute
[16:07:53] <chilversc> its up to you how the target works, eg, if its an id, a css selector, etc
[16:08:42] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Pvvcx/14/ better but I don't know the syntax for border
[16:09:34] <Whirl3d> but there are issues with the way I did it. It requires that your elements are in the same order in both areas
[16:10:05] <Whirl3d> or rather that index of the list item corresponds to the "post-" class
[16:10:34] <chilversc> Whirl3d: odd, its not requiring that for me, but I can't see why, because that's what I thought as well
[16:11:03] <raisman> I see
[16:11:26] <raisman> the bright side is that element in this case will be in the same order. chilversc example would work with elements in any order?
[16:11:29] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Pvvcx/16/
[16:11:46] <Whirl3d> much better, that way it depends on the classname of the source, regardless of what index it is
[16:12:19] <Whirl3d> but still, you can't add classes to the li items (for formatting or whatever) without messing it up
[16:13:14] <chilversc> Whirl3d: some how the earlier one works even out of order? http://jsfiddle.net/Au8zt/
[16:13:14] <Whirl3d> why are you using post-1, post-2, post-3 in the first place?
[16:13:18] <raisman> Whirl3d: adding classes with js or any other means?
[16:13:48] <RealityBall> raisman, http://jsfiddle.net/sAPkT/
[16:14:05] <RealityBall> raisman, you can also use onmouseout to set them back when the mouse is off
[16:14:33] <Whirl3d> RealityBall, that's one class of who knows how many
[16:14:38] <RealityBall> raisman, you would just have to copy paste this for each element
[16:14:50] <raisman> Whirl3d: I have sidebar with a list of title, each title is from a post that has an id. Inside the content area I have a thumbnail list with titles and the also have an id. So i'm planning to match them when you hover any of them
[16:15:23] <Whirl3d> I use anchor elements and href attributes for that
[16:15:26] <raisman> RealityBall: exactly, that't what i'm trying to avoid
[16:15:39] <raisman> hmm that sounds much better
[16:15:56] <raisman> so you match the href instead of the classes, hadn't thought of that
[16:16:15] <Whirl3d> if you wrap your titles in anchor elements with attributes like "#something" then you can select the "something " object like $($(this).attr("href"))
[16:16:15] <chilversc> that's pretty much the same as the data-target thing, only with an a tag
[16:16:30] <chilversc> data-target was an alternative to href since li doesn't have a href attribute
[16:16:46] <raisman> data-target seems cool too
[16:16:49] <Whirl3d> data-target is a great way to do it...without anchor...
[16:17:12] <Whirl3d> it's a little kludgy for non-html compliant browsers, but who cares.
[16:17:21] <Whirl3d> non-html5
[16:17:22] <chilversc> well my first way would be using href, but I don't like to attach href to tags that don't nativly have a href tag
[16:17:22] <Whirl3d> sorry
[16:17:23] <Whirl3d> lol
[16:17:36] <chilversc> Whirl3d: technically no, since html has always supported specifying arbitary attributes
[16:17:51] <raisman> i will be using href, i just didn't add it on the example hehe
[16:18:04] <chilversc> Whirl3d: xhtml requires you to create your own namespace for them (not sure if you need to supply a schema for it, but you might)
[16:18:07] <raisman> thanks for all the help guys
[16:18:29] <raisman> let see if i can pull this one out
[16:18:36] <Whirl3d> chilversc, thanks for the info. I wasn't aware of that
[16:19:18] <Whirl3d> raisman, you can use the .wrap method to wrap the articles in matching anchor tags. It's easy.
[16:19:25] <chilversc> Whirl3d: yeah, I remember early dhtml back in 199# using it for image rollovers, so you'd have an rsrc attribute or something
[16:19:47] <raisman> Whirl3d: haven't heard of that, ill take a look in the docs right now
[16:20:00] <Whirl3d> Yeah! Someone who remembers 199#....I love it.
[16:20:04] <chilversc> Whirl3d: html5 added a standard convention of "data-" prefix for custom attributes to allow for validation
[16:20:46] <Whirl3d> That's why I said, non-html5 compliant, I should have said xhtml docs in non-html5 compliant browsers. LOL
[16:20:55] <RealityBall> raisman, i got bored even though its not how you want to do it http://jsfiddle.net/5b232/
[16:21:11] <RealityBall> lol
[16:21:15] <ragnok> hi, is there anyone using this plugin? http://www.ajaxblender.com/bgstretcher-2-jquery-stretch-background-plugin-updated.html   i think is a bit heavy when the images are cycling. do you know any better?
[16:21:19] <poppiez> hi guys, I'm having trouble vertically aligning an image in the middle in IE7. it breaks when I append the HTML using jquery. if I hardcode the HTML on page load it works. test case here: http://jsfiddle.net/Qg4PB/
[16:21:22] <chilversc> Whirl3d: I mean validation with external tools, not counting xhtml since it isn't actually html, but xml, so has stricter requirements
[16:21:54] <chilversc> Whirl3d: it still allows you to create your own attributes, but you'd need a custom xmlns assigned to the attribute
[16:21:55] <raisman> RealityBall: yup that works for the example, but when you dinamically add more stuff, you would have to manually create new rules for new elements each time!
[16:22:50] <RealityBall> raisman, alright I guess I see what you are saying, and yeah you can just change how you select the elements
[16:22:50] <Whirl3d> poppiez, are you trolling?
[16:23:24] <poppiez> Whirl3d: huh?
[16:23:39] <RealityBall> raisman, this should help out a lot http://w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp
[16:24:05] <Whirl3d> I mean, are you serious? You are gonna come into a room full of people who cherish jquery and present a fiddle with one line of jquery and a bunch of inline-styles. wow
[16:24:43] <poppiez> Whirl3d: are you kidding me? I've created an isolated test case to present a bug in IE7
[16:25:09] <Whirl3d> it's not a bug in IE, it's a bug in approach, imo
[16:25:31] <raisman> lol
[16:25:47] <RealityBall> poppiez: try margin: auto and setting a doctype...
[16:25:52] <Whirl3d> and if it's a bug in IE7, (which I don't think it is), you should maybe try #ieplorer or something ..
[16:26:05] <vacho> I am suprised jquery UI does not have a dropdown :)
[16:26:10] <chilversc> poppiez: have you tried setting a width?
[16:26:57] <poppiez> RealityBall: margin: auto; on the image? doesn't jsfiddle set a doctype automatically?
[16:27:08] <poppiez> Whirl3d: you are very helpful - thank you
[16:27:19] <chilversc> margin: auto won't work in IE7
[16:27:24] <RealityBall> oh I didn't know what and yeah just make it display:block or somethign then use a margin auto
[16:27:37] <RealityBall> chilversc: really?
[16:28:00] <poppiez> RealityBall: by making it a block, you can't vertically align it in the middle
[16:28:08] <chilversc> actually, not sure now, I don't think IE7 supported it, I thought that was added in IE8
[16:28:24] <chilversc> though I don't have my VMs at home to test it
[16:28:33] <RealityBall> poppiez: oh alright thats interesting well good luck haha
[16:29:02] <poppiez> RealityBall: the thing is, the HTML+CSS is legit. that's the way it's done. however, when appended dynamically, IE7 doesn't listen
[16:29:16] <poppiez> pretty weird
[16:29:20] <chilversc> poppiez: I do remember an old bug (ie6, not sure about 7) where height wasn't correct if no width was set
[16:29:51] <poppiez> chilversc: tried it out - doesn't help
[16:30:04] <chilversc> poppiez: also, after adding it, have you tried re-sizing the browser window manually?
[16:30:13] <raisman> Whirl3d: this is as far as i coudl get http://jsfiddle.net/5b232/2/ How can I select elements with the same href?
[16:30:16] <poppiez> chilversc: but that's because IE6 can't scale an image properly by setting one of the dimensions
[16:30:24] <RealityBall> is it possible to throw images in jfiddle?
[16:30:43] <poppiez> chilversc: why resize the window?
[16:31:09] <chilversc> poppiez: wondering if its a layout bug, where it doesn't update correctly, even now I find them occationally in many browsers
[16:31:48] <poppiez> chilversc: it must be. IE7 probably isn't reflowing when appending the markup
[16:32:19] <chilversc> poppiez: yeah, but there's a difference between mis-calculated, and just incorrect, mis-calculated sometimes goes when resizing since it re-lays out the whole page
[16:32:20] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/Qg4PB/9/
[16:32:24] <RealityBall> raisman, $("[href='#']") and replace number with what you want to select
[16:32:34] <RealityBall> I mean replace #
[16:32:40] <caaakeeey1> is there a way (or suitable workaround) of knowing when a user has switched to the tab/browser?
[16:33:01] <chilversc> caaakeeey1: for what purpose?
[16:33:59] <poppiez> chilversc: resizing doesn't help at all. it's like it's completely ignoring the styles
[16:35:02] <chilversc> poppiez: not sure then, that's all the bugs I can remember off the top of my head, and don't have IE7 to test with
[16:35:24] <Whirl3d> isn't this a #css thing?
[16:36:19] <poppiez> Whirl3d: just tried your fiddle out. same thing. I'll try in #css :) just figured I'd ask here since the CSS works but when appending using javascript it breaks
[16:37:37] <Whirl3d> I think that's because of the inline styles
[16:37:51] <Whirl3d> try applying the styles without making them inline
[16:38:03] <Whirl3d> apply them with jQuery afterwards
[16:39:00] <Whirl3d> raisman ?
[16:39:26] <caaakeeey1> chilversc, chat - i display when there are messages in other channels, and there should be no notifications if youve seen the messages
[16:40:54] <poppiez> Whirl3d: same thing
[16:41:38] <poppiez> damn this is a sucky bug :P

[16:42:42] <teear> Mage People use torrents nowadays
[16:43:05] <RealityBall> can ppl help me loop this slideshow? http://jsfiddle.net/tWy9M/
[16:43:19] <RealityBall> I am not sure how I should loop it
[16:43:24] <RealityBall> I wrote it
[16:44:04] <Whirl3d> RealityBall, it's tricky with sliders because you are going to have to use .append to append the first image to the end
[16:44:06] <teear> loop it into an infinite loop and after that show a picture of Barbra Streisand, that should do it
[16:44:22] <Whirl3d> lonely, huh?
[16:44:55] <RealityBall> Whirl3d, thanks man I will look into that
[16:45:26] <teear> I'm sure you are prettyboy
[16:45:56] <RealityBall> Whirled: I suppose I will have to test if the slide number is divisible by the number of slides and append based on that...
[16:46:00] <Whirl3d> RealityBall, when you are scrolling to the right, grab the list of slides in your container, select the first and append it to the list...it will show up at the end
[16:46:14] <Whirl3d> then you do the opposite but use .last and prepend
[16:46:47] <Whirl3d> Really, all you have to do is make sure that at least two slides ARENT visible.
[16:47:09] <Whirl3d> otherwise you get this weird thing where half a slide pops off one end
[16:47:29] <RealityBall> Whirl3d: I will think about what you said and see what I can do, thanks
[16:47:57] <Whirl3d> sure. Post a fiddle and I'm sure folks will work with you on it...Its a lot more difficult with pastebin
[16:48:24] <RealityBall> alright

[16:51:43] <poppiez> Whirl3d: this technique: http://jsfiddle.net/kizu/4RPFa/74/. by adding a helper span, it works out
[16:51:54] <teear> helper span :D
[16:52:08] <poppiez> yay
[16:52:46] <Whirl3d> great job. Now if we just had a way to automate posted solutions that work...next version of jsfiddle I hear will have that.
[16:53:18] <teear> sounds like a wired hackaround and not a real spec changing solution
[16:54:38] <teear> yee soundalike yeear in the internets lottalike man
[16:54:56] <jeffreylevesque> Whirl3d you work for jsfiddle?
[16:55:18] <Whirl3d> no, but I love them.

[16:55:53] <teear> yeer work not for jsfiddle? Yee work for snoopalittle dickashizzle snoopajsdooggydog
[16:57:01] <xinc> teear, Whirl3d, poppiez: the reason you need a "helper span" with that method of vertical centering is because without it the inline-block image has nothing to vertically align itself to.
[16:58:04] <xinc> vertical-align on inline-blocks will align the center of the inline-block with the inline (or inline-block) content that surrounds it, such as text.
[16:58:11] <poppiez> xinc: it works without a helper span as long as it doesn't get appended by javascript
[16:58:22] <teear> Why would you need to align it vertically, depends off course where the bitch is at but
[16:58:26] <poppiez> xinc: but nice with a clarification
[16:59:08] <teear> Just do it with css like the rest of us do
[16:59:15] <teear> :------------------------------D
[16:59:56] <teear> Spans are usually something that is not needed
[17:00:18] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/YU4JM/2/ why isn't scrolling up being detected?
[17:00:51] <teear> You only need those in a some specific word or letter in a inline content where you wan't to replace that character with a puppyface
[17:01:39] <teear> That is because you're not a detective
[17:03:01] <teear> Why you have slash (/) in your <br> tag?
[17:03:48] <teear> Are ye 1 of these xhtml wannabees
[17:07:17] <someprimetime> http://jsfiddle.net/someprimetime/YU4JM/5/ it'll detect mousedown but not mouseup any reason why?

[17:17:46] <donnaR> hey jq is it possible to animate a moz degree rotation?
[17:18:17] <teear> css3 makes anything possible
[17:19:07] <donnaR> thanks teear that was awesome
[17:19:14] <xarxer> is rgba values supported in .animate() in jquery-ui?
[17:19:23] <xarxer> are*
[17:19:23] <teear> But you first need to learn that css can animate
[17:19:46] <BinaryKitten> css can set animation sets
[17:19:52] <teear> Oh you are talking about jquery, you can do that with css donnagirl
[17:19:54] <BinaryKitten> so things can animate from 1 style ot another
[17:20:09] <donnaR> is it possible to do 3d rotations etc, without the need of an extra lib?
[17:20:16] <donnaR> and if so how?
[17:20:24] <teear> Do it with css3
[17:20:44] <teear> Only latest browsers support it tho
[17:21:11] <donnaR> no lynx support?
[17:21:16] <donnaR> :(
[17:21:17] <teear> hahha
[17:21:29] <BinaryKitten> donnaR you mean like: http://www.zachstronaut.com/projects/rotate3di/
[17:22:29] <donnaR> BinaryKitten, yes, I dont want to use any more pc cycles than needed
[17:22:46] <donnaR> thats why I'm asking if theres another way around than looping the animate function
[17:23:09] <BinaryKitten> donnaR you're going to have to resort to something like RaphaelJS which may give you what you're after
[17:23:33] <donnaR> ok I'll look it up, thanks
[17:23:34] <teear> css3 rotation without jquery: http://demo.hakoniemi.net/Cross-browserRotateTransformationwithCSS/
[17:23:35] <BinaryKitten> there are libs that will help, OR you can write it natively. But sorry, no, jQuery doesn't do that out of the box
[17:23:57] <BinaryKitten> teear are you here for jQuery or CSS?
[17:24:14] <teear> for fucks sake, it can be done with css
[17:24:25] <teear> i'm here to lear jquery
[17:24:31] <donnaR> not even webgl?
[17:24:49] <BinaryKitten> donnaR that's another option, but more limited
[17:24:53] <donnaR> can i use hw acceleration for css?
[17:25:10] <xinc> donnaR: if you use 3d transforms, yes.
[17:26:37] <xinc> very old blog entry from webkit about 3D transforms: http://www.webkit.org/blog/386/3d-transforms/
[17:34:29] <Whirl3d> sorry for the off-topic question, but how do I make an object in PHP?
[17:35:59] <Sopheria> $obj = new <class>?
[17:36:11] <ckoning> Whirl3d: $obj = new StdObj
[17:36:12] <ckoning> ;
[17:36:35] <vacho> seems like jquey ajax does not honor headers, how can I make it do that?
[17:36:37] <Whirl3d> I have an array in $stack and I want an object that is {contents: $stack}
[17:36:42] <vacho> 	header("Content-type: application/vnd.ms-excel"); 	header("Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=report.xls");
[17:38:36] <ckoning> Whirl3d: In JS or PHP?
[17:38:46] <ckoning> PHP by the look of it
[17:39:17] <ckoning> $obj = new StdObj; $obj->contents = $stack;
[17:39:35] <Whirl3d> great thanks.
[17:40:57] <ckoning> no prob
[17:41:21] <ckoning> vacho: What do you mean by "honor headers"
[17:46:45] <Whirl3d> grrrr. my ajax is returning an array as a JSON object, which is perfect except that it thinks it's an object. I need it to be a simple array and $.makeArray() isn't cutting it. do I have to manually map it to an array?
[17:48:08] <shoky> what do you mean that its an array as a json object
[17:48:33] <teear> Whirlpool
[17:48:36] <Whirl3d> I successfully get back an array [{},{},{}]
[17:48:45] <shoky> oh
[17:48:49] <Whirl3d> when I log my json object
[17:49:03] <itmustbejj> anyone in here familiar with jquery.zclip.js?
[17:49:49] <shoky> so what do you mean 'it thinks its an object'
[17:50:50] <Whirl3d> in my success handler, I pass the JSON object to the function that tries to pop() the first item on the list..no luck
[17:50:56] <Whirl3d> param. has not method pop
[17:51:08] <Whirl3d> but if I $.map(json, function (elem) {
[17:51:10] <Whirl3d> it works
[17:51:43] <shoky> umm what does your php output?
[17:52:14] <shoky> it's supposed to be..  json.myArray  not just json
[17:52:22] <Whirl3d> http://paigeharvey.net/assets/php/paintings.php?series=birds
[17:52:31] <shoky> ok that's not valid json
[17:52:39] <shoky> it should be a json object
[17:52:49] <Whirl3d> I use $jsonencode(array) in php
[17:53:10] <shoky> so you get a json encoding of an array, but its not a complete json object
[17:53:25] <shoky> (i guess, i dont know php)
[17:53:38] <Whirl3d> I guess I don't know json.
[17:53:39] <Whirl3d> lol
[17:53:48] <shoky> LoL :P
[17:53:57] <Whirl3d> what constitutes a valid json object and where can I read about it?
[17:54:18] <shoky> you know what it is, it's an object (not an array()
[17:54:19] <shoky> )
[17:55:05] <Whirl3d> I tried to convert it to an object using $obj=stdObj; $obj->contents $stack;   and then echoing that...no luck 500 error
[17:55:44] <shoky> hmm like a week ago i googled the answer for someone
[17:55:49] <shoky> wish i remembered ;D
[17:56:07] <shoky> it was a bit weird i think
[17:56:29] <vacho> im sending a jquery ajax call to a page that has headers set to return to download a file
[17:56:38] <Whirl3d> Yeah. Now ijust get a 500 error
[17:56:38] <vacho> but it's not promting for download, it's downloading the file.
[17:57:33] <teear> suck my balls i'm not an json man i'm an caravan van man
[17:58:09] <shoky> Whirl3d hmm maybe im wrong about the valid json thing
[17:59:09] <vacho> http://pastebin.com/bcxw2TNW
[17:59:20] <vacho> these are the response headers from the ajax call..shouldn't that prompt for download?
[18:00:06] <shoky> Whirl3d how about Array.prototype.pop.call(json)  :P
[18:00:22] <systemfault> :/
[18:00:39] <systemfault> Whirl3d: What's wrong mister?
[18:01:12] <shoky> so why was i sure valid json === valid json object
[18:01:25] <shoky> ;S
[18:01:49] <Whirl3d> systemfault, I am getting my ajax results as json in an array format that I can't use pop on
[18:01:56] <systemfault> wut
[18:02:07] <systemfault> o_O
[18:02:16] <systemfault> Can I see that json?
[18:02:57] <Whirl3d> sure
[18:03:05] <Whirl3d> http://www.paigeharvey.net/gallery/Gallery-v3.html
[18:03:18] <Whirl3d> I echo the result in the console.
[18:03:59] <Whirl3d> shoky, I tried the Array.prototype. trick...lno luck 8(
[18:04:06] <shoky> you mispelled prototype though :D
[18:04:21] <teear> json
[18:04:28] <shoky> typo'd more like

[18:05:43] <teear> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJjCefEbAA0
[18:05:47] <Whirl3d> how can that be if I specify dataType:json?
[18:06:06] <systemfault> Whirl3d: You specified datatype and not dataType
[18:06:12] <teear> yee need to specify parser
[18:06:16] <Whirl3d> oh wow.
[18:06:25] <Whirl3d> pathetic, really. LOL
[18:06:36] <systemfault> Lawlz

[18:37:10] <aniasis> I'm creating a webpage for a mobile phone what should be my max-width and height?
[18:38:46] <jeffreylevesque> aniasis
[18:38:48] <jeffreylevesque> http://mobiforge.com/designing/story/effective-design-multiple-screen-sizes
[18:39:07] <jeffreylevesque> prob google if you can do some kind of conditional css depending on the device
[18:39:30] <teear> aniasis max-width in css media-queries is what you want
[18:40:01] <teear> Depends on your layout and where you want to place the break point
[18:40:03] <cannjeff> anises are you using jQuery mobile?
[18:41:04] <teear> Of course depends if you are talking about a responsive html based layout or a one specifically for mobile users
[18:42:02] <teear> [04:37] <aniasis> I'm creating a webpage for a mobile phone what should be my max-width and height?
[18:42:18] <teear> Depends on the mobile phone you're designing for hehhe
[18:42:49] <jeffreylevesque> anyone have a few extra minutes ?
[18:43:04] <teear> i have some
[18:43:08] <cannjeff> for what?
[18:43:22] <teear> dunno, you're the one asking
[18:43:35] <cannjeff> nope i wasn't :p
[18:43:45] <jeffreylevesque> i created a select list, and it displays the proper image upon selection.  each iteration, it displays an extra image than it should
[18:43:51] <jeffreylevesque> http://jsfiddle.net/vawa7/19/
[18:44:43] <teear> US states in an array
[18:44:53] <jeffreylevesque> yeah
[18:45:17] <pedz> Sorry for off topic question: I'm looking for a forum where I can ask for web design questions.  e.g. I have an element that is a link and also has a context menu.  How can I decorate it so the users know it has both functionalities?
[18:45:33] <jeffreylevesque> pedz: there's a css room
[18:45:36] <teear> yee select californiaee and it goes to: http://nursing.virginia.edu/research/srmhrc/images/Counselors/Counselors_CA.jpg
[18:45:38] <jeffreylevesque> #css
[18:45:48] <pedz> hanks
[18:45:49] <pedz> thanks
[18:46:27] <jeffreylevesque> now select 'Number of social workers.." and choose any map
[18:46:31] <jeffreylevesque> it'll pop up two images
[18:46:33] <jeffreylevesque> lol
[18:47:12] <teear> You cannot do that because when i selected california it just dumped me to to that nursing.. etc map and out of the script
[18:47:52] <teear> so i am now only looking to that map image
[18:48:16] <jeffreylevesque> the map image should be a new window
[18:48:26] <jeffreylevesque> but the jsfiddle page should be still there
[18:48:31] <Mage_Dude> When using the autocomplete plugin, by supplying the label:value pairs will the form (if submitted) have the 'value' or the 'label' as that form element?
[18:49:23] <sakens> Hello
[18:49:53] <sakens> by doing    $('form').submit(function(){});
[18:50:14] <sakens> how can I select the current form node that is submited?
[18:50:31] <sakens> I have a HTML with many forms
[18:50:42] <teear>  $('dick').lick(suction(){});
[18:51:00] <sakens> and I want to know which one is submited
[18:51:28] <teear> it was the third one
[18:51:43] <cannjeff> jeffreylevesque - add this line ' break; ' after the window.open("…");
[18:54:58] <jeffreylevesque> thanks canJeff I think the problem is something else.  Maybe I'm binding too many events
[18:55:35] <cannjeff> its because you're calling window.open() inside two nested for loops
[18:55:43] <teear> jeffreyvonarseponte
[18:56:02] <cannjeff> you need to break out of them once you've found your matched map
[18:56:19] <jeffreylevesque> ok :)
[18:56:26] <jeffreylevesque> so as you suggested, this is what I have: http://jsfiddle.net/vawa7/20/
[18:57:12] <cannjeff> closer
[18:57:19] <cannjeff> now you have a different issue however
[18:58:22] <ki3> I'm using jqueryui autocomplete. I don't want to use a pre-defined list of values. If I want to retrieve the values from my mysql database... can a PHP file be specified to query the db and some how put them in the correct format?
[18:58:47] <Mage_Dude> ki3: yes
[18:59:30] <ki3> k cool
[18:59:53] <teear> you just need to lear how to code in php
[18:59:53] <ki3> so put ugh source: "search.php", ?
[19:00:01] <ki3> I know php :P
[19:00:05] <ki3> jquery = nope
[19:00:08] <ki3> :)
[19:00:20] <teear> put it in idunno.php
[19:00:31] <ki3> ???
[19:00:33] <ki3> .........
[19:00:44] <ki3> anyway
[19:00:50] <teear> you can put it in any file with .php extension you dumbfuck
[19:00:58] <ki3> ugh
[19:01:02] <thang> lol.
[19:01:03] <ki3> ...are you stupid?
[19:01:06] <teear> ugh.php is ok
[19:01:12] <ki3> I'm referring to the jquery ui
[19:01:15] <ki3> you fucking retard
[19:01:21] <teear> No i am german
[19:01:25] <ki3> 			$('#auto').autocomplete(
[19:01:27] <ki3> 			{
[19:01:28] <ki3> 				source: "search.php",
[19:01:30] <ki3> 				minLength: 3
[19:01:35] <teear> oh
[19:01:41] <ki3> here
[19:01:43] <teear> thats a different issue
[19:01:52] <teear> go to some jquery channel
[19:01:53] <ki3> source: "teear-is-afuckingretard.php"
[19:01:54] <ki3> happy?
[19:02:28] <thang> ki3: iirc you need to format the results coming from search.php per autocompletes spec
[19:02:57] <teear> $('#dickinmymouth-makes-me-happy').autocomplete
[19:03:00] <ki3> I wasn't even sure if source: was the right syntax to specify a php file
[19:03:09] <ki3> that would make sense
[19:03:18] <teear> i know
[19:03:22] <digs> How do i get the data for 'ship_time' ? http://codepad.org/BID9s1XQ -- So far I have this.. console.log(callResponse.response); -- Which gets me what you see in that paste.
[19:03:25] <Mage_Dude> Try using jsfiddle to post code. It's easier to read
[19:03:39] <ki3> be glad it's the internet or I would knock you the fuck out
[19:03:41] <thang> i believe it is, the autocomplete plugin will make a post request and send in what the user has written at that time and php will return a list of possible mathes
[19:03:42] <Mage_Dude> @ki3 not digs
[19:04:06] <ki3> mage_dude: thanks
[19:06:39] <jeffreylevesque> anyone .change() function?
[19:06:49] <cannjeff> working on it
[19:08:55] <cannjeff> jeffreylevesque - do you want it to bring up a new map option is selected or only when the State is changed?
[19:10:15] <jeffreylevesque> cannjeff: new map option i think would be best
[19:11:45] <cannjeff> jeffreylevesque - hows this http://jsfiddle.net/vawa7/21/
[19:12:56] <jeffreylevesque> Excellent!
[19:13:04] <jeffreylevesque> cannjeff++
[19:13:22] <cannjeff> no problem
[19:14:25] <cannjeff> it can be simplified a bit more, but i'll leave that up to you
[19:14:36] <jeffreylevesque> Thanks for your time
[19:14:37] <jeffreylevesque> :)

[20:02:18] <GAEfan> Hi.  Can someone tell me if I can change the line color in jqplot.  e.g.: blue line above 0, red line below 0?
[20:15:50] <ki3> I'm trying to populate an autocomplete list from a mysql database. I have the autocomplete function being called ->   http://pastebin.com/qyfevEj4  and the php file looks like this: http://pastebin.com/E2TNhmYT
[20:16:00] <ki3> it's doing absolutely nothing... it worked when it was a pre-defined list
[20:17:15] <shoky> ki3: what does the php output
[20:22:30] <shoky> ki3: dont really know php, but it doesnt seem that you're outputting a JSON array
[20:22:54] <ki3> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4330448/how-to-use-new-jqueryui-autocomplete-with-phpmysql-in-a-simple-way I got it from this example
[20:22:56] <ki3> weird
[20:23:11] <ki3> Ah you're right
[20:23:20] <ki3> it did work all i had to do was changing $("#search").autocomplete({ source: "./search.php"}); to $("#search").autocomplete("./search.php"); – Breezer Dec 2 '10 at 1:12
[20:23:25] <ki3> hmmm
[20:25:39] <ki3> Warning: mysql_fetch_array(): supplied argument is not a valid MySQL result resource in /html/accounts_admin_jquery_contacts.php on line 11
[20:25:54] <ki3> while ($row = mysql_fetch_array($result)) { $names .= $row[accounts_regular_name]."\n"; }
[20:27:53] <shoky> umm the code you pasted already does use the 'source' option..
[20:28:20] <shoky> er nm
[20:29:09] <ki3> I pointed the source to the php correctly right :P
[20:29:13] <ki3> it must be the php i'll ask in #php
[20:29:34] <shoky> does it output something or not ?
[20:31:32] <ki3> nope
[20:31:33] <ki3> =\
[20:34:27] <shoky> echo out your generated sql
[20:35:06] <rchavik> hi, is it possible to use $.css() to set multiple values for the same property ? eg: http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/
[20:38:24] <shoky> that's not really multiple values for the same property
[20:39:21] <tw2113> i wonder if .css() can take an array
[20:39:25] <rchavik> okay, my terminology maybe incorrect..
[20:39:57] <rchavik> tw2113, i tried with an array... didn't work
[20:40:27] <shoky> it can take an object  {'width':5, 'background':'blue'} or whatever
[20:40:42] <tw2113> .css({'background-color': '#ffe', 'border-left': '5px solid #ccc'})
[20:41:33] <tw2113> makes sense
[20:42:34] <shoky> anyway, applying 'background' multiple times in a stylesheet is the same as calling .css() multiple times
[20:42:43] <shoky> the last one that works will stick
[20:43:10] <tw2113> even with multi-bgs in css3?
[20:43:21] <shoky> dunno bout that
[20:43:49] <tw2113> oh the questions i ask
[20:44:32] <shoky> oh, that can be done with just one: .css('background-image','url:(a.png), url(b.png)')
[20:45:59] <tw2113> then you'll want to position in a different property, from what i've experienced
[20:46:05] <rchavik> shoky, tw2113 after some trial/error, it worked. thanks
[20:46:36] <tw2113> gah! how did that happen, i was helpful
[20:48:03] <Cork> tw2113: if i remember correctly, no, prefixes doesn't work too well in inline css
[20:48:18] <tw2113> screw the prefixes then *extends tall finger*
[20:48:33] <Cork> tw2113: screw inline css actually
[20:48:37] <tw2113> workaround...create a class with the background stuff, and just use jQuery to tack on the class
[20:48:43] <Cork> exactly
[20:48:51] <Cork> but its not a workaround
[20:48:57] <Cork> its how you should do it in the first place
[20:49:09] <tw2113> "workaround"....."more appropriate solution"
[20:49:18] <tw2113> potayto tomahto
[20:49:32] <Cork> i meant not just for values with prefixes
[20:49:39] <tw2113> i won't argue
[20:49:47] <tw2113> css in your stylesheet, keep it off your tags
[20:49:55] <Cork> and out of your code
[20:50:01] <shoky> into my food
[20:50:05] <tw2113> i'm just feeling chatty and no one is talking in wordpress
[20:50:32] <rchavik> Cork, it's to be used with a color picker.. where user changes his background color
[20:51:02] <Cork> ya, i wondered if i should mention the exceptions :)
[20:51:06] <Cork> but i skipped it
[20:51:13] <rchavik> well, in my case, the user changes the starting color for the gradient
[20:51:44] <rchavik> Cork, :)
[20:51:49] <Cork> if you need to use prefixes in js, its better to just have a "find the prefix" support function
[20:51:53] <Cork> that runs when the page loads
[20:52:07] <Cork> then you just concut the full string
[20:53:18] <Cork> it makes the code cleaner, and the browser happier
[20:53:45] <shoky> food yummier
[20:53:50] <shoky> penis mightier
[20:53:54] <Cork> ....
[20:54:00] <shoky> im batman
[20:54:07] <Cork> ook, i was with you up intoo the last ones
[20:54:21] <shoky> ye im a loner
[20:54:31] <systemfault> :/
[20:54:49] <shoky> helo sysfau
[20:58:52] <scathen^C> hey guys can someone give me a hand? http://pastebin.com/2EEv1ZVV
[21:00:10] <snover> sorry both my hands are busy in this delicious bag of dicks
[21:00:20] <scathen^C> lol
[21:00:27] <snover>  /cc coldhead
[21:02:34] <Cork> scathen^C: you would have to move the getID to the top of foo
[21:02:44] <Cork> its not part of this when your sending it to bar
[21:04:09] <scathen^C> yeah sorry fixed it
[21:04:10] <scathen^C> http://pastebin.com/0e2qC9ZC
[21:04:16] <scathen^C> my query was more about the method issue
[21:04:21] <Cork> no
[21:04:30] <Cork> line 6-8 needs to be before line 4
[21:04:52] <scathen^C> aaahh ok
[21:05:00] <Cork> thats not a statement
[21:05:05] <Cork> its a declaration
[21:05:15] <Cork> so the variable needs to be declared before your trying to use it
[21:05:25] <scathen^C> so you have to put all the method decs first?
[21:05:48] <Cork> var = function() {} need to happen before the first one trying to use it yes
[21:05:59] <Cork> function name() {} doesn't
[21:06:31] <scathen^C> ok i moved it to the top and i still get the error. changing it to function getID(){} still gets the error also
[21:06:52] <Cork> function getID won't work as you want it as a member
[21:07:11] <Cork> but set the example as a running code in jsfiddle
[21:07:16] <Cork> it should work
[21:07:29] <scathen^C> ok brb
[21:11:57] <scathen^C> Cork: thanks for the help, it works now. so just to recap, var func = function(){} needs to come before the objects that use it? and function func(){} doesn't???
[21:12:09] <Cork> yes
[21:12:17] <Cork> function name() {} is a statement
[21:12:17] <scathen^C> ok cool, thanks for that
[21:12:26] <Cork> its parsed as a separate pass over the code
[21:12:54] <Cork> name = function() {} is a declaration, and needs to happen in the code flow order
[21:17:07] <Joshibros> Hello
[21:18:02] <Ghost1227> I'm using the following to handle display of certain field in a form... `jQuery(document).ready(function() { $("selected[name='type']").change(function() {});` it works fine, but I want it to run not only when 'type' changes, but also when the page is loaded. how would i do this?
[21:19:19] <Cork> scathen^C: sorry have to blame the early morning, function name() {} is a statement; and name = function() {}; is an expression
[21:19:21] <Cork> nothing else >_<
[21:20:08] <Cork> jQuery(document).ready(function($) { $("selected[name='type']").change(function() {}).change(); })
[21:20:14] <Cork> Ghost1227: ^
[21:23:05] <Ghost1227> Corey: that doesn't work in either use case
[21:23:21] <Cork> uh wait a min selected?
[21:23:27] <Cork> you mean select?
[21:23:41] <Joshibros> Hello Friends i am new to jquery i want to achieve the following results [ Lets for example say :  I have one text input field, user types in a number, i want to add 5 to that number ( input_number + 5 ), and show the result in another DIV, i want to do that dynamically meaning as soon as user starts typeing the result is shown (so if the e is a 10 digit number than when user enters the 1st...
[21:23:42] <Joshibros> ...digit answer is already calculated and shown in the Display DIV, when user enters 2nd digit the answer is recalculated accordingly so on and so forth), What should i do to acomplish this ?? Any link to similar tutorial is also fine .
[21:23:47] <Ghost1227> Corey: yea, sorry... type
[21:23:49] <Ghost1227> *typo
[21:24:08] <Cork> Ghost1227: .change(); works
[21:24:35] <Ghost1227> Cork: i just tested it... it didn't
[21:24:49] <Cork> is the selector working?
[21:25:24] <Joshibros> someone please guide me in right direction
[21:26:10] <systemfault> Joshibros: You would create the elements you need and probably handle the keyup event
[21:26:20] <Cork> Ghost1227: http://jsfiddle.net/s2rZY/
[21:26:24] <systemfault> You might also need parseInt
[21:26:42] <Ghost1227> Cork: ok... it DOES work in the original use case, but doesn't on page load
[21:26:59] <Cork> Ghost1227: then your code is failing somewhere else
[21:27:05] <Joshibros> systemfault keyup will .change() work ??
[21:27:18] <Joshibros> *keyup or .change ??
[21:27:39] <systemfault> Joshibros: Change happens when you change the content and a blur happens IIRC
[21:28:15] <Cork> systemfault: input might be even more interesting then keyup
[21:28:26] <systemfault> Cork: ?
[21:28:32] <Cork> oninput
[21:28:39] <Cork> its a fairly new event
[21:28:39] <systemfault> Cork: Never heard of that one.

[21:29:17] <Cork> as always though, doens't work in ie
[21:29:29] <Cork> so you'll have to have a fallback for it
[21:29:47] <Ghost1227> Cork: hmm looks like you're right
[21:30:12] <Cork> it works like onkeypress except that the field is updated before its triggered
[21:30:30] <Cork> and no events for none value keys
[21:31:02] <systemfault> Joshibros: Here's your homework :P http://jsfiddle.net/m2MSw/
[21:31:41] <Joshibros> systemfault thank you, thank you very much
[21:31:43] <systemfault> http://jsfiddle.net/m2MSw/1/
[21:31:44] <Cork> keyup has the problem of not reacting to repeating keys though
[21:31:45] <systemfault> :P
[21:31:53] <diverdude> If i have a textarea of width X pixels, how can i translate that into how many characters that corresponds to in a given font (problem is that the font may change)?
[21:32:00] <Cork> not that that normally a problem, but just so you know
[21:32:06] <systemfault> Cork: :)
[21:32:23] <Joshibros> this is my first time on this irc # but very helpful thank you very much
[21:32:31] <systemfault> Joshibros: You're welcome
[21:32:49] <Cork> Joshibros: copy the text to a span, set the font type of the element
[21:32:55] <Cork> grab the width of the element
[21:33:02] <Cork> Joshibros: sadly thats the ONLY way
[21:33:04] <Cork> and it sucks
[21:33:32] <systemfault> Cork: Wut?
[21:33:49] <systemfault> Cork: Y U TELL THAT TO JOSHIBROS?
[21:33:53] <systemfault> :D
[21:33:59] <Cork> ugg
[21:33:59] <systemfault> </stupidmode>
[21:34:00] <Cork> sorry
[21:34:06] <Joshibros> ok... now i will experiment, i am very new to jquery ... i only watched some videos from LULABOT and i wanted to try some stuff
[21:34:08] <Cork> diverdude: that was for you
[21:34:53] <reecefowell> how can i get .find() to work in the way i am using it here? http://jsfiddle.net/NSLrT/1/ if you uncomment the .attr('checked', true); then it works, but i need to use the find below to restrict the checkboxes it works on.
[21:35:07] <Cork> i soo wish browser would expose one of the systems font dimention functions
[21:35:28] <reecefowell> the demo on the side shows 2 links, clicking read checks the checkboxes of items that are read, unread the same for unread etc.
[21:37:34] <Cork> reecefowell: not completely sure what your trying to do but
[21:37:47] <Cork> i'm guessing filter is what you want see ?.filter
[21:37:52] <bot-t> .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[21:38:24] <diverdude> Cork: but how do i know the width of the element?
[21:38:32] <reecefowell> Cork: i am writing a private messaging bundle for Symfony2. I need to be able to check checkboxes based on the messages status, i have other properties other than read/unread i have not mentioned in the code snippet as it was unnecessary.
[21:38:37] <Cork> diverdude:  .width()?
[21:39:04] <diverdude> Cork: yeah but i mean the width of a character
[21:39:10] <Cork> reecefowell: .find looks for children to the elements in the selector
[21:39:11] <reecefowell> But i wanted the jquery code to be reusable as i have some parts on my website where i have multiple regions of checkboxes, so the data-idenfitier ensures i select the correct group
[21:39:22] <Cork> reecefowell: and input boxes can't have children
[21:39:25] <reecefowell> oh i see
[21:39:27] <Cork> so your code doesn't really make sence
[21:39:31] <Cork> *sense
[21:39:36] <reecefowell> yeah that makes a lose of sense what your saying and why its not working
[21:39:44] <reecefowell> so i should try filter then
[21:39:49] <Cork> yes
[21:40:14] <reecefowell> thanks
[21:40:44] <Cork> diverdude: <span id="dimention" style="font:my-font-from-target"></span> $('#dimention').html('a').width()
[21:41:00] <Cork> diverdude: like i said, it sucks badly
[21:41:10] <Cork> and is a REAL performance killer
[21:41:11] <reecefowell> Cork: thank you, my code works now :)
[21:41:16] <Cork> but its the only way
[21:41:23] <Cork> reecefowell: np
[21:41:46] <diverdude> Cork: hehe yeah ok...thats one way to go about it
[21:41:57] <Cork> diverdude: like i said; its the only way
[21:42:08] <Cork> you can't ever ask the browser about text dimentions
[21:42:13] <Cork> only element dimentions
[21:42:24] <diverdude> Cork: are you sure? I mean, how does the browser then calculate em values?
[21:42:27] <Cork> yes
[21:42:40] <Cork> i've tried to solve this my self about 2 years back
[21:42:49] <Cork> and hunted for weeks
[21:42:52] <Cork> this is the only way
[21:42:57] <Cork> hmm
[21:43:01] <Cork> one exception though
[21:43:10] <Cork> you might be able to do it with canvas now days
[21:43:16] <Cork> never tried that
[21:43:30] <Cork> (didn't exist as an option back then)
[21:43:54] <diverdude> Cork: here is a js calculator. wonder how they do it: http://riddle.pl/emcalc/
[21:44:24] <Cork> it doesn't calculate the font size
[21:44:40] <Cork> it calculates what with the given font size a px should be
[21:44:47] <Cork> its a completly different problem
[21:45:14] <Cork> might be what you want, but its not what i was talking about :)
[21:46:13] <Cork> body { font-size: 11px; }  span { font-size: 2em; }
[21:46:16] <Cork> that kind of deal
[21:46:21] <diverdude> Cork: im using it for a textarea that should expend vertically when text-content reaches the border
[21:46:37] <Cork> ya, then your trying to do what i was talking about
[21:46:53] <Cork> you want to know how much space the text actually takes
[21:46:57] <diverdude> Cork: and im setting width:100%
[21:47:02] <diverdude> yeah
[21:47:04] <Cork> not what font size would give the same effect
[21:47:25] <Cork> sorry px value would give the same dimention as a unit (em/pt/%/...)
[21:47:27] <systemfault> Also.. browsers don't use fixed width fonts..
[21:47:37] <Cork> exactly
[21:47:39] <systemfault> llllllllll    is smaller than MMMMMMMM
[21:47:41] <Cork> well they can
[21:47:48] <Cork> but normally you don't
[21:48:01] <diverdude> yeah...but i guess worst case is w, so would have to base on that
[21:48:29] <Cork> ya, but the calculation can get quite a bit wrong fast
[21:48:48] <diverdude> gmail and facebook managed to make some solution
[21:48:48] <Cork> like in tens of pixels in 3-4 lines
[21:49:27] <Cork> diverdude: normally by just counting the number of rows in the textarea
[21:49:30] <ki3> I'm using jquery ui autocomplete. I have it pointing to a php file as the source -> http://pastebin.com/1yv4LE0d When it's set to a pre-defined list... I get suggestions and click one and it closes.. everything is perfect. With this php file now it keeps opening again after clicking a suggested option...
[21:49:31] <ki3> sigh
[21:49:39] <Cork> diverdude:  and setting rows on the element
[21:50:37] <Cork> diverdude: but what i meant if you want to KNOW an element is the only way
[21:50:52] <Cork> diverdude: if you want to guess theres loads of ways
[21:50:55] <diverdude> Cork: yeah i can see
[21:50:59] <Cork> all will fails at some point
[21:51:07] <Cork> *will fail
[21:51:32] <systemfault> ki3: Do things properly… give us a url to work with.
[21:51:47] <diverdude> Cork: well maybe the <span id="dimention" style="font:my-font-from-target"></span> $('#dimention').html('a').width() aint to bad
[21:51:50] <systemfault> ki3:  btw.. there's a nice function in PHP called json_encode
[21:52:13] <diverdude> Cork: i can just set font on the span to whatever font the textarea has
[21:52:13] <Cork> diverdude: depends on how many text positions you need to use it for
[21:52:25] <Cork> diverdude: i needed it for a table, and YES it sucked bad
[21:52:33] <Cork> (to the point i took it out)
[21:52:45] <diverdude> Cork: so what did you do instead?
[21:52:46] <Cork> but if its just one textarea
[21:52:48] <Cork> it shouldn't matter
[21:52:53] <Cork> diverdude: predefined values
[21:52:58] <diverdude> right
[21:53:33] <Cork> its a bit sad, cause it would have been nicer if it managed it on its own, but...
[21:54:14] <diverdude> well as of now im using it just for one text area...and will very rarely contain more than 20 characters...
[21:54:27] <Cork> the amount of text doen't matter
[21:54:33] <Cork> its how many times you need to set it
[21:54:49] <Cork> i needed to do it 50*8 times before i could show a table
[21:54:55] <Cork> 1*1 is nothing
[21:54:58] <diverdude> and you needed to set for each cell?
[21:55:09] <Cork> no i needed to calculate for each cell
[21:55:12] <Cork> to find the widest one
[21:55:29] <Cork> then set 8 times
[21:55:36] <Cork> (ones for each column)
[21:55:50] <diverdude> right
[21:55:55] <diverdude> sounds sucky
[21:55:58] <Cork> it ws
[21:56:01] <Cork> *it was
[21:56:18] <Cork> i soo wished i was coding in c++ back then :)
[21:56:27] <diverdude> Corey: y?
[21:56:33] <systemfault> C++ is soo sexy
[21:56:39] <diverdude> there are also sucky problems in c++
[21:56:57] <Cork> cause c++ has access to the system calls where you can ask how much space text x takes
[21:57:12] <Cork> and that isn't as slow as dom manipulations
[21:57:24] <diverdude> hehe true
[21:57:51] <systemfault> C++ TEMPLATE ALL THE THINGS!
[21:57:59] <ki3> systemfault: the problem is with the onfocus when I turn it off everything and remove disabled everything is fine
[21:58:02] <ki3> <input style="color: #f95d75" id="tags" name="accountto"  READONLY type="text" onfocus="javascript:$(this).autocomplete('search','');">
[21:58:13] <ki3> I want the user to be able to click the form and have it open and select an option
[21:58:14] <ki3> no typing
[21:58:18] <Cork> ugg...
[21:58:24] <Cork> ki3: don't use inline event listners
[21:58:25] <ki3> it worked fine when everything was pre-defined
[21:58:34] <Cork> and DEFENITLY don't use javascript: anywhere
[21:58:49] <ki3> alright so i'll remove the onfocus
[21:59:00] <ki3> how do I make the form launch the autocomplete onclick then
[22:00:56] <diverdude> Cork: i guess this should do then: $('<span>').css('font', $(this).css('font')).html('W').width();
[22:01:20] <Cork> diverdude: ya, i think you need to set display: inline-block; too
[22:01:29] <Cork> to get the element to have a width
[22:01:35] <diverdude> ah
[22:01:52] <diverdude> maybe just make it a div instead?
[22:02:13] <Cork> divs fill the width of the parent by default
[22:02:25] <diverdude> $('<span>').css('font', $(this).css('font')).css('display','inline-block').html('W').width();
[22:02:25] <Cork> or rather display: block; does
[22:02:30] <ki3> .on("focus", function () {$(this).autocomplete("search", "");
[22:02:32] <ki3> what about using that?
[22:04:22] <diverdude> Cork: hmm console.log($('<span>').css('font', $(this).css('font')).css('display','inline-block').html('W').width()); seems to return 0
[22:04:25] <Cork> ki3: focus would trigger after you choose a value from the autocomplete
[22:04:53] <Cork> diverdude: one sec, and i'll try to reproduce the old code; my memory is a bit rusty
[22:04:57] <ki3> sigh...
[22:05:18] <ki3> http://jsfiddle.net/9JmVu/
[22:05:22] <ki3> it works here though
[22:05:36] <ki3> not on my actual page
[22:06:49] <scathen^C> anybody know how i could disable scrolling on paste??
[22:07:45] <Cork> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/dGFCH/
[22:08:21] <Cork> scathen^C: you mean the form field scroll into view when you paste in it=
[22:08:23] <Cork> ?
[22:08:52] <Cork> diverdude: uh.... sorry loads of typos there
[22:09:04] <diverdude> uhhm
[22:09:15] <diverdude> that gives the width of the text area?
[22:09:20] <Cork> ya
[22:09:22] <Cork> i know
[22:09:40] <Cork> it actualyl moves the textarea :)
[22:09:45] <diverdude> but...that is just the same as tester.width(9
[22:09:53] <Cork> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/dGFCH/1/
[22:09:59] <Cork> like i said, a typo
[22:11:56] <Cork> diverdude: if your wondering why i don't try to hide the span
[22:12:17] <Cork> its not needed cause it won't show before your js ends, and i remove it again before that
[22:12:34] <Cork> if your using timers though or ajax callbacks you need to be a bit carefull
[22:13:07] <diverdude> Cork: yeah ok i se what you are doin
[22:13:31] <Cork> diverdude: width isn't set until the element is appended to the dom
[22:13:45] <Cork> or rather an unattached element doesn't have a width
[22:13:51] <diverdude> aha
[22:13:56] <diverdude> i suspected that
[22:14:21] <Cork> doesn't have dimensions actually
[22:14:44] <diverdude> but this wont cause any flicker?
[22:14:46] <Cork> (unless you set it in css)
[22:14:51] <Cork> nope
[22:15:03] <Cork> as long as you add and remove it in the same code block
[22:15:14] <diverdude> ohh.. nice
[22:15:54] <Cork> function() { var tester; ... $('body').append(); ... $.ajax().success(function() { tester.remove() }); } would flicker
[22:16:09] <diverdude> yeah
[22:16:11] <Cork> function() { $.ajax().success(function() { var tester; ... $('body').append(); ... tester.remove() }); } wouldn't flicker
[22:16:58] <Cork> so in any sync code section, the browser reflow until the function ends
[22:17:18] <Cork> or rather until any js function chain ends
[22:18:21] <diverdude> Cork: hmm white space is ignored
[22:18:37] <Cork> shouldn't be
[22:19:17] <diverdude> Cork: it seems so
[22:19:43] <Cork> leading and ending does
[22:19:53] <diverdude> Cork: also intermediate
[22:20:07] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/dGFCH/2/
[22:20:15] <Cork> right!
[22:20:22] <Cork> now i remember
[22:20:43] <diverdude> ?
[22:22:27] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/dGFCH/3/
[22:22:45] <Cork> white-space: pre to the rescue :)
[22:23:12] <diverdude> ohhh
[22:23:28] <diverdude> it then regards both leading, trailing and intermediate ws?
[22:23:34] <Cork> yes
[22:23:39] <Cork> and \n's
[22:23:41] <Cork> and so on
[22:24:27] <Cork> its vital for the functionality :)
[22:24:39] <diverdude> swee
[22:24:42] <diverdude> sweet
[22:24:42] <diverdude> console.log(tester.css('white-space','pre').css('font', $(this).css('font')).css('display','inline-block').html($(this).val()).width());
[22:24:46] <Cork> else it will calculate completly wrong
[22:25:15] <diverdude> nasty but very useful snippet hehe
[22:25:23] <diverdude> Cork: thx a lot man
[22:25:57] <Cork> diverdude:  .css({ 'white-space': 'pre', 'display': 'inline-block', 'font': $(this).css('font') })
[22:26:07] <diverdude> ah
[22:26:07] <Cork> at least makes it a bit easier on the eye
[22:26:18] <diverdude> yeah ok..didnt know that is possible
[22:27:39] <ki3> http://jsfiddle.net/9JmVu/4/ ugh what's wrong with it now... sigh
[22:27:48] <ki3> now it wont initialize... fml
[22:27:49] <ki3> ...
[22:28:32] <Cork> ki3: you have script tags in your script tags
[22:28:44] <ki3> get rid of $(function() {
[22:28:46] <ki3> ?
[22:28:52] <Cork> thats fine
[22:29:12] <ki3> http://stackoverflow.com/a/7454280
[22:29:22] <ki3> is said to work
[22:29:33] <ki3> i have no idea what im doing wrong
[22:29:52] <Cork> ki3: http://jsfiddle.net/9JmVu/5/
[22:30:09] <diverdude> Cork: can i ask you a final question?
[22:30:14] <Cork> you missed the end of $(function() {
[22:30:21] <Cork> diverdude: you just did? :D
[22:30:24] <diverdude> hehe
[22:30:38] <Cork> just ask the question instead of asking if you can ask
[22:30:45] <Cork> saves us all the time
[22:30:58] <Cork> *saves both of us the time
[22:31:15] <systemfault> :/
[22:32:00] <diverdude> Cork: its just that....now im reacton on .keyup(), however there is functionality which will insert text in the textarea also using .val(), and when that happens the handler should also be invoked. Do you know if there is a handler that reacts both in .keyup and text inserted?
[22:32:18] <systemfault> ?eval var answer = ['yes', 'no', 'I don\'t know']; answer[Math.floor(Math.random() * answer.length)];
[22:32:23] <Cork> diverdude: nope
[22:32:24] <bot-t> systemfault: "yes"
[22:32:29] <Cork> diverdude: just trigger the keyup event
[22:32:34] <Cork> .keyup();
[22:32:38] <diverdude> oh
[22:32:57] <Cork> systemfault++
[22:33:28] <diverdude> that was to easy :D
[22:33:33] <diverdude> haha
[22:33:36] <diverdude> thx
[22:33:43] <Cork> np
[22:33:55] <Cork> coldhead: what did you change?
[22:34:07] <systemfault> Cork: The last part I think
[22:34:14] <systemfault> Which is the lulz
[22:34:25] <Cork> ah
[22:44:49] <ki3> Cork: It's doing the same thing as my javascript code did... =\ When I click on the form it automatically opens (this is perfect)... I select an item and it displays the changed item... (great)... then it opens again... (not good at all)... my PHP outputs this... maybe its the format of the results...? [{"value":"waddwadwdwqd"},{"value":"dogs"},{"value":"11public11"}]
[22:45:16] <ki3>        // avoid double-pop-up issueclosing = true;setTimeout(function() { closing = false; }, 300);
[22:45:22] <ki3> guess that doesnt work :P
[22:45:40] <ki3> "Avoids re-popping up list after clicking an item"
[22:45:43] <Cork> ki3: you have a working example?
[22:46:19] <Cork> the one before in jsfiddle didn't get any data, so it never worked
[22:47:40] <ki3> Cork: perhaps this fixes it: http://stackoverflow.com/a/9015172
[22:48:13] <Cork> i could, but can't test dead code
[22:49:01] <ki3> gotcha
[22:51:28] <ki3> Well I got the right code for sure I just am having the same issue from last time
[22:51:29] <ki3> http://jsfiddle.net/9JmVu/6/
[22:51:48] <ki3> I have the script tags in my script tags I think
[22:51:58] <ki3> sorry I only know php =\
[22:52:35] <diverdude> \n takes up the same width no matter the font right?
[22:57:26] <Cork> diverdude: it doens't take up any width
[22:57:32] <Cork> diverdude: it changes the height though
[23:04:47] <ki3> http://jsfiddle.net/9JmVu/7/ =\ does nothing
[23:04:50] <diverdude> Cork: its just strange...it is as if something is missing. try to type a lot of 'l' here http://jsfiddle.net/qWrc9/3/
[23:04:57] <ki3> cork save the day please :|
[23:05:45] <diverdude> Cork: you will notice that in the beginning it works ok, but then it starts to 'drift', so that row expansion is delayed
[23:05:51] <diverdude> so to say
[23:06:09] <diverdude> i was thinking it may be because \n were inserted
[23:12:40] <Cork> diverdude: you can't use $(this).width it will include the size of the scrollbars
[23:15:01] <Cork> hmm wait a min, your getting the wrong font
[23:21:31] <vectorshelve> Cork: hai mate ;)
[23:22:20] <Cork> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/qWrc9/4/
[23:22:26] <Cork> vectorshelve: hi
[23:30:52] <Whirl3d> could someone look at this really simple code and tell me why I can't access one of my methods: http://www.paigeharvey.net/gallery/Gallery-v3.html
[23:31:09] <Whirl3d> it says that showContent is not defined, but it clearly is...
[23:31:43] <diverdude> Cork: hmm yeah...it still 'drifts' for some reason though :/
[23:33:11] <Cork> diverdude: try innerWidth on $(this) instead of width
[23:33:26] <sacho_> that's some mighty nesting there
[23:33:26] <Cork> you don't want the padding and what not from the form field
[23:34:55] <diverdude> Cork: same :/ http://jsfiddle.net/qWrc9/5/
[23:34:59] <sacho_> Whirl3d, there's no function showContent defined on window
[23:35:45] <Whirl3d> it's defined in Gallery
[23:36:28] <Cork> Whirl3d: your calling loadNext before its defined
[23:36:49] <sacho_> no, he's not
[23:36:53] <Whirl3d> it doesn't precompile everything then run?
[23:37:03] <Whirl3d> okay, i'll fix that.
[23:37:04] <Cork> not when its expresions
[23:37:10] <Cork> Whirl3d: anyway thats not the problem
[23:37:26] <Cork> Whirl3d: line 64 is
[23:37:31] <Whirl3d> yeah, showGallery works
[23:37:32] <Cork> your using this from the parent function
[23:37:47] <Cork> this there is window not the parents this
[23:37:56] <Whirl3d> but it works for showGallery
[23:38:04] <Whirl3d> that's not the issue now, it's showContent
[23:38:05] <sacho_> urgh, mixed function declarations with expressions and even some globals sprinkled in
[23:38:10] <sacho_> consistency is a bitch
[23:38:10] <Cork> var self = this; s/this.showGallery()/self.showGallery()/
[23:39:00] <Whirl3d> huh?
[23:39:42] <Cork> na, the problem comes even earlier
[23:39:49] <Cork> your losing your this variable somewhere
[23:40:01] <Whirl3d> oh wait inside my showContent funcction lol
[23:40:30] <Cork> uh...
[23:41:01] <Cork> your adding hideGallery, showGallery, addImage and addContent to window
[23:41:12] <Cork> not to your object
[23:41:32] <Whirl3d> they are temporary functions that only need to be run once
[23:41:45] <Cork> then don't assign them to the window object
[23:41:51] <Whirl3d> they work
[23:41:53] <Cork> window object == global scope
[23:42:02] <Whirl3d> how do I do it better?
[23:42:05] <Cork> ya but you can call hideGallery from anywhere
[23:42:11] <Cork> define your variables
[23:42:21] <Cork> var hideGallery = function() {};
[23:43:03] <Whirl3d> keep in mind that I have been messing this up for a couple of hours. Originally it was much clearner than this. This is the result of beating my head agains thte wall and trying everything I could to get it to work.
[23:43:21] <diverdude> Cork: any ideas?
[23:43:33] <Cork> Whirl3d: then go back a couple of hours and start over
[23:43:40] <Whirl3d> wow.
[23:43:44] <Whirl3d> thanks for the support
[23:43:53] <Cork> Whirl3d: its a complet mess right now
[23:44:02] <Cork> it adds things all over the place
[23:44:29] <Cork> diverdude: form elements are tricky to find dimentions for
[23:44:53] <Cork> diverdude: so play with css values and things like that and see if you can find what causes it
[23:46:53] <acconrad> Quick question - what's better performance? $(tbody).children(tr:visible:first) or $(tbody).children(tr).filter(':visible').filter(':first')
[23:47:56] <Cork> acconrad: $(tbody).children('tr:visible').first()
[23:48:57] <acconrad> Cork: the jQuery docs say use "filter(':visible')" to maximize performance…so would $(tbody).children('tr').filter(':visible').first() be even faster?
[23:49:16] <acconrad> That's why I'm asking - there seems to be so much conflicting info
[23:49:29] <Cork> acconrad: the selector in children runs filter so no
[23:49:35] <Cork> your just running filter twice
[23:49:57] <Cork> .first() is faster then filter(':first') though
[23:50:09] <Cork> not by a meaning full difference though
[23:50:21] <Cork> this is more hypothetical
[23:51:10] <Cork> acconrad: if you are really interested in performance, avoid :* selectors
[23:51:34] <Cork> acconrad: ex. use a class to hide your tr instead
[23:51:46] <Cork> or to show them, is even better
[23:51:49] <Cork> then select on that
[23:52:26] <Cork> so  $(tbody).children('tr.show').first()
[23:52:28] <acconrad> well we use a hidden class to hide rows that shouldn't be shown
[23:52:38] <acconrad> is there a "not" operator
[23:52:40] <acconrad> so something like
[23:52:46] <Cork> so  $(tbody).children('tr').not('.show').first()
[23:52:54] <acconrad> aaah okay
[23:53:04] <acconrad> $(tbody).children('tr').not('.hidden').first()
[23:53:08] <Cork> uh, wait
[23:53:15] <Cork> so  $(tbody).children().not('.hidden').first()
[23:53:20] <Cork> no need to select tr
[23:53:27] <Cork> its the only element that can be in tbody anyway
[23:53:36] <acconrad> ah right
[23:53:36] <Cork> it will only slow things down
[23:54:33] <acconrad> wow, this has been super helpful, thanks so much Cork!
[23:54:43] <Cork> acconrad: np
[23:54:47] <acconrad> I'm trying to do some front-end optimizations to our slowest pieces of code so this has really helped
