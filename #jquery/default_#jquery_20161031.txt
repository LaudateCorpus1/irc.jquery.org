[03:46:07] <rindolf> Hi all.
[03:48:13] <hellyeah> join #javascript
[03:48:14] <hellyeah> sorry
[05:23:41] <arup_r> Hi, I have a field A ( dropdown ) and field B ( dropdown ). I want to show options from B based on selection in A. So question is can we show/hide option elements?
[05:24:48] <arup_r> ok possible just got an example http://jsfiddle.net/Mxkfr/2/ from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7697936/jquery-show-hide-options-from-one-select-drop-down-when-option-on-other-select
[05:24:52] <arup_r> let me try.
[05:47:07] <Cork> arup_r: the best option (by far) is to show and hide separate select elements based on the choice in the first select element
[05:47:40] <Cork> arup_r: if that isn't an option, you have to move the option elements out of the select element, as it isn't compatible cross browsers to hide them but keep them in the select element
[05:48:10] <arup_r> You mean to create complete separate dropdowns by grouping the options?
[05:49:12] <Cork> something like <select id="a"></select><select id="a1-b" class="hidden" disabled></select><select id="a2-b" class="hidden"></select>
[05:49:34] <Cork> and what you do from the event in select a is to toggle the class and disabled on the other select elements
[05:49:48] <Cork> (might want to add an additional class to group the select elements)
[05:51:40] <arup_r> so does form sends data of the hidden elements?
[05:51:52] <Cork> that is what the disabled is for
[05:51:57] <arup_r> ok
[05:55:22] <arup_r> Cork: loading them from server using Ajax is good? http://plugins.krajee.com/dependent-dropdown/demo like this example
[05:55:49] <Cork> arup_r: its an ok option, it will cause a bit of lag while the content is loading
[05:56:02] <Cork> but if you have a lot of options it might be worth it
[05:56:37] <arup_r> I can do it programmatically, but it is like to much code. Like cloning options and from a dropdown and then showing them by doing filter.
[05:57:01] <Cork> yup
[05:57:11] <Cork> that is why i recommended just adding separate select elements
[05:57:11] <arup_r> so thought to do show/hide, but you said it is not cross browser compatible. So, I will reject it.
[05:57:38] <arup_r> ok Cork if someone edit html and remove disable?
[05:57:52] <Cork> it will be submitted, and?
[05:58:07] <Cork> they could edit any field and do what ever they like
[05:58:20] <Cork> you have to guard against that server side, not in what exists in the form
[05:58:25] <arup_r> just thinking this case. because "that is why i recommended just adding separate select elements" is the easiest way to implemnet. So only if someone edits is what I am thinking.
[05:58:36] <arup_r> ok
[05:58:56] <Cork> basically you can't ever depend on what is in the form
[05:59:05] <Cork> as it is client side and anything can be modified
[05:59:11] <arup_r> if they edit, then I will save complete different values.
[05:59:15] <arup_r> I agree with you
[05:59:18] <Cork> heck they might run a separate script posting to the server
[06:27:06] <burzum> hi
[06:31:40] <lulul> on the following functin i get a weird error http://notey.it/n/dzdq VM65 1:325 Synchronous XMLHttpRequest on the main thread is deprecated because of its detrimental effects to the end user's experience. any ideas how to solve this issue ?
[06:42:02] <burzum> why is the data attribute not set in line 22 and the show in line 21 not triggered? http://pastebin.com/VSPXw8g1 I've debugged the code, the selector is correct and the id is present and the event fired. just the changes to .btn-leave-conversation are not made.
[07:37:41] <sigdk> Is there any naming convention for the html elements? should I use id="btn-foobar" or id="foobar-btn" or id="foobar" or sth similar? Any argument for/against?
[07:38:57] <iaj_> Hi guys - can someone recommen me a nice plugin that allows
[07:39:11] <iaj_> some kind of eye-candish mp3 preview player?
[07:49:05] <IamTrying> it it BUG? "Uncaught DOMException: Failed to read the 'selectionStart' property from 'HTMLInputElement': The input element's type ('hidden') does not support selection." -  http://paste.ubuntu.com/23406686/
[07:54:18] <km4> hej
[08:00:51] <AdamPDotty> sigdk: common is "btn-foobar"
[08:01:31] <AdamPDotty> I personally do not think, "btn" should be in there, because thats task of the tag.
[08:01:33] <sigdk> AdamPDotty, this looks also like css class name I think...
[08:01:58] <AdamPDotty> so rather button.foobar than .btn-foobar
[08:02:46] <AdamPDotty> Also I would not think of them as "css class", because the HTML is ideally constructed first. The css only added on to that.
[08:46:32] <sigdk> AdamPDotty, lets say my page has two forms with input text fields for which I 'd write my username. How should I name them? Am I supposed to use two different files (one for each form). Also the js code shall be split?
[08:55:25] <AdamPDotty> If possible, reuse code, do not copy ... DRY. I would use "username". That supports auto fill-out by browsers.
[09:13:42] <Cork> sigdk: i would argue to not use an id at all
[09:14:02] <Cork> sigdk: best option is normally to use a class for the action the element is meant to have
[09:14:17] <Cork> and take what it does the action on based on the position in the dom
[09:14:36] <Cork> that way you can write a small snippet of code that can generically handle any number of those actions
[09:15:29] <sigdk> Cork, I'm not sure I understand... all I know is to use id to refer to the elements... can you write a small example?
[09:16:12] <hellyeah> the id is used for unique element right
[09:16:22] <hellyeah> if you dont create same element twice
[09:16:49] <hellyeah> class can used use if you want to assign event to multiple elements in one time
[09:17:06] <hellyeah> am i correct?
[09:20:09] <hellyeah> sigdk:  what are you in trouble with?
[09:21:13] <sigdk> hellyeah, trying to simplify the names I use. Same thing has different name on different forms. I'm wondering if I do sth wrong
[09:21:58] <hellyeah> did you fiddle anything?
[09:22:08] <hellyeah> i think you should show some codes to channel
[09:22:17] <hellyeah> may be i got it wrong
[09:22:18] <Cork> sigdk: https://jsfiddle.net/wcp826xn/1/
[09:22:31] <hellyeah> hmm Cork is here :D
[09:24:34] <sigdk> Cork, hmm... I see, interesting
[09:25:54] <Cork> sigdk: i hope that gives you an idea of what i was trying to point at
[09:26:08] <Cork> basically ppl tend to love ids way to much
[09:26:20] <Cork> where classes is very often the better choice
[09:27:25] <sigdk> Cork, it's much more straightforward... tbh I thought it was the only way to go
[09:35:36] <david_brent> Hi guys, i need some help. I'm trying to insert an function to be triggered before the current onchange function and then proceed with the original event. I've tried to save the current .change function, unbind the event  add my onchange function which does it's thing and then apply the previously saved function. But seems that the saved function when called starts triggering itself recursively.
[09:35:59] <david_brent> How can i get the existing event and call it, seems like im calling the onchange from the onchange
[09:36:22] <Cork> david_brent: there isn't normally a good way to make something run before another event
[09:36:41] <Cork> could you make a jsfiddle.net with the code you're trying to work with?
[09:36:50] <david_brent> Yes, one min
[09:44:58] <david_brent> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/c9ueadxd/1/
[09:45:16] <david_brent> Cork: sorry
[09:45:33] <david_brent> Cork: https://jsfiddle.net/c9ueadxd/2/
[09:46:15] <Cork> ya, you can't do it that way
[09:46:27] <Cork> el.change != on('change'
[09:46:44] <david_brent> is there any way to achieve this sort of behaviour ? to get the actual function being triggered?
[09:46:47] <Cork> dom nativly you can't do this at all
[09:46:55] <Cork> with jquery you can use an unsupported hack
[09:47:09] <Cork> why exactly do you need this?
[09:47:35] <Cork> cause it will require quite a bit of hacking, and it won't be a very reliable solution
[09:48:03] <david_brent> i need to track changes of certain filter elements. But some of them have existing events that redirect, so i cannot just add another fn to the change.
[09:48:21] <Cork> are they using return false?
[09:48:26] <Cork> else it shouldn't matter
[09:49:19] <david_brent> i can't really be sure
[09:50:28] <david_brent> what each event does, i'm trying to find a way to just wrap around it
[09:50:42] <Cork> you can't wrap around it
[09:50:48] <Cork> especially if you want a reliable solution
[09:50:53] <david_brent> if you could point me to the 'unsupported hack' i'd try it
[09:50:55] <david_brent> :)
[09:51:18] <Cork> it would be deep inspecting into $._data(elm, 'events') and storing those event handlers
[09:51:21] <Cork> then restting them
[09:51:27] <Cork> and then hoping you can bind them again
[09:51:43] <Cork> and finally hope you didn't kill any reference (like scoping)
[09:51:54] <david_brent> yikes :)
[09:52:05] <david_brent> thanks
[09:52:05] <Cork> so ya, i wouldn't recommend it unless you know what the code in question does
[09:52:18] <Cork> cause if they do the wrong thing, things WILL break
[09:52:49] <Cork> the best option is to just provide a "track" function and have them call it
[09:53:10] <Cork> or bind the event as early as possible so they haven't bound to the element yet
[09:53:40] <david_brent> ok, will see how it goes. Thanks alot, much appreciated.
[09:54:39] <Cork> david_brent: but this is what i would recommend: https://jsfiddle.net/c9ueadxd/3/
[09:55:15] <Cork> in programming it is normally better to not be "too clever"
[09:56:08] <david_brent> :)
[09:56:20] <david_brent> well this is quite 'clever' :D
[09:56:38] <Cork> not really, it just depends on the one writing the event handler to behave
[09:56:45] <Cork> and not do return false; in there event handler
[09:56:50] <Cork> cause if they do your code won't run
[09:56:55] <david_brent> but i'm afraid it won't be this simple, i best rerite some other stuff
[09:57:04] <david_brent> but i'm afraid it won't be this simple, i best rewrite some other stuff
[09:57:13] <Cork> most other stuff will be less reliable
[09:59:58] <david_brent> thanks again, you saved me quite some time
[10:07:40] <iaj_> Hi guys, when you wanted to put a nice looking audio player on your page, which plugin would you choose for that?
[11:04:36] <sam-lap> hi guys, do you know any good background slider  (optimezed for mobile too) ?
[11:40:19] <sigdk> Is this popular or people tend to implement "steps" manually: http://www.jquery-steps.com/   ?
[11:49:56] <MikeD_> sigdk: i wouldn't use that for "steps" - i expect business rules are always going to be more complicated than that ideal
[11:50:28] <sigdk> MikeD_, first of all, what are the most useful jquery plugins?
[11:51:05] <MikeD_> idk, i guess it depends on each use you have
[11:52:33] <MikeD_> fwiw, i broke the jquery steps example on their page
[11:53:07] <laveonix> how can i use backbone.js for click events with three.js objects?
[11:54:41] <sigdk> MikeD_, it has been a pain in the ass for me so far, I want to get rid of it. I'm wondering if I should look for another plugin, or try implement a similar "efect" myself
[11:54:51] <sigdk> with pure js
[11:57:19] <MikeD_> if you have anything more complicated than copy/paste from their example, I'd suggest roll-yer-own
[12:09:12] <sigdk> MikeD_, how do I implement that? use .hide() and .show() when clicking next button?
[12:09:58] <sigdk> I mean sth like: $("#step-1-div").hide() ... etc
[12:16:52] <BobFrankly> does jquery not like spaces in json key names?
[12:18:26] <AdamPDotty> !tias
[12:20:24] <taplar> BobFrankly: what do you mean?
[12:23:00] <BobFrankly> I do love how asking a question in an IRC channel suddenly makes google helpful
[12:23:19] <BobFrankly> varName['Key With Spaces']
[12:23:21] <BobFrankly> that works
[12:23:24] <taplar> sure
[12:23:55] <taplar> and i don't really follow your last statement.  you never explained what your issue was, :|
[12:23:58] <BobFrankly> how would I produce an array of keynames in a json object?
[12:24:19] <taplar> an array works as json
[12:24:29] <taplar> or { somelabel: [] }
[12:25:08] <taplar> oh, i gotcha
[12:25:08] <BobFrankly> taplar: I was loading via loadedData = $.getJSON("filename.txt") ; myObj = $.parseJSON(loadedData)
[12:25:14] <taplar> Object.keys( object )
[12:26:02] <BobFrankly> oh, thank you for that
[12:26:19] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/mo9m8vao/
[12:26:29] <BobFrankly> I'm too used to powershell, haven't been in the js/jQuery side of things in forever
[12:26:40] <taplar> that's just js fwiw
[12:27:14] <BobFrankly> yeah, I'm dabbling in the devtools console trying to find my footing
[12:27:20] <taplar> :)
[12:32:19] <sigdk> what is the relationship between jquery and jquery-ui?
[12:39:38] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui is a Ui framework built using jquery.
[12:39:51] <robertmaxrees> it includes a bunch of widgets and things.
[12:40:28] <robertmaxrees> sigdk ^ :)
[12:41:27] <taplar_lunch> jquery is the body, jquery ui is the pretty clothes, :D
[12:41:38] <robertmaxrees> hahaa
[12:41:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah basically.
[12:41:46] <taplar_lunch> puffy clothes to some extent, ;)
[12:42:10] <taplar_lunch> robert, react is pissin me off!
[12:42:24] <robertmaxrees> what why?
[12:42:36] <taplar_lunch> can't seem to get it to generate the onClick i'm putting on it
[12:43:24] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:43:32] <taplar_lunch> it's weird.  looks the same as some examples i've seen.  watching those tutorials again to see if i missed something
[12:44:31] <taplar_lunch> https://jsfiddle.net/mo9m8vao/
[12:47:46] <sigdk> Shouldn't this work: <script src="js/jquery-3.1.1.min.js" type="text/javascript" />      Note I replaced ></script>
[12:48:07] <robertmaxrees> sigdk technicallly script tags can't be self-closing.
[12:48:50] <taplar_lunch> i think i read an article once that recommended people forgetting everything xhtml tried to do, lol
[12:48:56] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:49:29] <robertmaxrees> i mean, html5 borrows some ideas.
[12:49:38] <robertmaxrees> buuut basically people hated legit markup.
[12:49:43] <taplar_lunch> lol
[12:49:52] <taplar_lunch> sad
[13:09:26] <patrickk> Shouldn't this return the number and not the text? https://jsfiddle.net/z3rnofy1/
[13:09:55] <patrickk> er nvm
[13:09:57] <robertmaxrees> heh
[13:10:12] <patrickk> :/
[13:10:58] <robertmaxrees> i do that sort of stuff far more often than i'd care to admit.
[13:11:26] <patrickk> yea that page has a bunch of code so probably missed that "u" out
[13:11:48] <patrickk> hm but still how can it return the text when i didn't ask for it
[13:12:09] <robertmaxrees> because that's the value
[13:12:10] <patrickk> shouldn't that have given an error?
[13:12:14] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:12:20] <patrickk> er
[13:12:22] <robertmaxrees> that's how the DOM works.
[13:12:25] <patrickk> ok
[13:12:42] <patrickk> confused me there
[13:13:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/z3rnofy1/1/
[13:15:15] <patrickk> lol yeah that I already made out
[13:15:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:15:20] <patrickk> was just alerting it
[13:15:37] <patrickk> but isnt "9" the value and September the .text() ?
[13:15:43] <patrickk> quite confusing there
[13:15:45] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:15:53] <robertmaxrees> if you spelled value correctly, then you WOULD get the 9
[13:16:05] <patrickk> and if wrong then it would consider the text as value?
[13:16:12] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[13:16:21] <robertmaxrees> that't not a jquery quirk btw.
[13:16:27] <patrickk> hm yeah
[13:16:30] <robertmaxrees> that's the actual underlying DOM.
[13:17:37] <patrickk> yeah I guess so
[13:17:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:19:56] <patrickk> if you say so then
[13:20:22] <robertmaxrees> errrm, I don't say so.  that's really how it works (shrug)
[13:21:31] <patrickk> lol. ok
[13:21:40] <patrickk> yeah that's what I meant
[13:22:18] <robertmaxrees> aight.
[13:22:20] <taplar_lunch> hah!  figured it out
[13:22:26] <robertmaxrees> what was it?
[13:22:38] <taplar_lunch> you don't use quotes for onClick
[13:22:45] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah.
[13:22:51] <robertmaxrees> because it's code.
[13:22:56] <taplar_lunch> gah, annoying lol
[13:23:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  a little different.
[13:23:06] <patrickk> er
[13:23:06] <taplar_lunch> i had to download the non .min version to figure it out
[13:23:31] <taplar_lunch> patrickk: ignore me, random side stuff
[13:23:52] <patrickk> nah, I just faced an annoying stuff too
[13:23:59] <patrickk> so glad it was jus tnot me
[13:24:10] <taplar_lunch> always fun learning new stuff, :)
[13:24:23] <patrickk> lol mine was a silly one
[13:25:12] <sillyslux> oh.. vale.. that's spanish isn't it?
[13:25:50] <patrickk> is it? idk really am not spanish
[13:26:14] <sillyslux> i think it's "ok"
[13:26:33] <patrickk> vale = ok in spanish?
[13:26:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:26:55] <patrickk> vale then, learned something new
[13:27:05] <sillyslux> <option vale="6"> was that on purpose?
[13:27:07] <taplar_lunch> lmao
[13:27:24] <taplar_lunch> i'm so southern. i just thought vale then was slang for like "well then"
[13:27:24] <patrickk> sillyslux: no, missed the "u"
[13:27:32] <sillyslux> well vale then
[13:27:58] <patrickk> was generated with php so just had to enter once and it was the mistake
[13:28:17] <sillyslux> vale, vale..
[13:29:08] <sillyslux> pero mis espanol no est mui bienne
[13:31:13] <BobFrankly> loadedData = $.getJSON(fName,function(data){fData = $.parseJSON(data);return fData})     <can't get at fData after this line, scoping issue or am I doing it wrong?
[13:31:20] <robertmaxrees> doing it wrong.
[13:31:26] <robertmaxrees> getJson is async.
[13:31:43] <robertmaxrees> anything that relies on the data returned from it needs to be done in the callback.
[13:31:45] <taplar_lunch> looks like he is in the callback
[13:31:54] <taplar_lunch> but your doing parseJSON.  should't it already be parsed?
[13:32:02] <robertmaxrees> theoretically.
[13:32:06] <BobFrankly> I would think so, but it's not coming out that way
[13:32:14] <taplar_lunch> baah
[13:32:17] <robertmaxrees> right, you're getting the deferred instead.
[13:32:36] <robertmaxrees> loadedData is a deferred - you can use loadedData.then()
[13:32:45] <robertmaxrees> or do your workj after your parseJSON int hat callback.
[13:32:54] <sigdk> I'm going through this example: https://jqueryui.com/dialog/#modal-form   Where am I supposed to find style.css   ?
[13:33:13] <robertmaxrees> sigdk it's apart of the jqui download/cdn hosted stuff
[13:34:24] <BobFrankly> loadedData.then()   <---produces an object, but not the one from my JSON. It's got always, done, fail, etc
[13:34:47] <BobFrankly> does then() need a parameter?
[13:34:49] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly right - you would pass that a function and do whatever you need with the returned data.
[13:35:04] <robertmaxrees> .then(function(myData) { /* your data is available here */ });
[13:36:25] <BobFrankly> that produces the same/similar object
[13:36:29] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/fbff26504384
[13:36:32] <robertmaxrees> you can't return out of ajax calls.
[13:36:44] <robertmaxrees> because they're async by nature.
[13:36:56] <robertmaxrees> so anything you'd like to do with the returned data must be done within that callback.
[13:36:57] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I get this error: GET file:///home/sigdk/workspace/osm/css/images/ui-icons_444444_256x240.png net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND     What am I missing?
[13:37:08] <robertmaxrees> sigdk a server.
[13:37:43] <patrickk> the file
[13:38:10] <sigdk> I don't see it in the example either...
[13:38:10] <robertmaxrees> just setup a server and use it.  then make sure you've got the assets downloaded to the correct place.
[13:39:07] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, what server? I have the files in my directory and open the html file with my browser
[13:39:35] <robertmaxrees> sigdk right, that's not a very good way to do development work :) you want to set up a local webserver to work against instead.
[13:39:56] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, what is the problem with that?
[13:39:59] <robertmaxrees> if you're raelly opposed to doing that, then triple-check to make sure you've downloaded all of the assets correctly.
[13:40:08] <robertmaxrees> browsers get funny trying to access local files.
[13:40:38] <sillyslux> yeah reeeally funny :(
[13:42:10] <sillyslux> i always thought tiddlywiki was a nice idea, a webbased wiki which you could open locally from file:// but over time browsers made things impossible
[13:44:10] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I fixed the problem but I'm not sure I understand the logic behind. I thought all I needed was a jquery-ui.css and a jquery-ui.js file (I downloaded the .min. ones)... seems that I need to pull more files (not sure what's needed and what are the dependencies)
[13:44:43] <sillyslux> http://tiddlywiki.com/
[13:45:00] <sillyslux> Internal JavaScript Error Well, this is embarrassing. It is recommended that you restart TiddlyWiki by refreshing your browser Script error.
[13:45:27] <robertmaxrees> sigdk https://i.imgur.com/ii03m8L.png
[13:45:58] <robertmaxrees> if you click this link and look at the directories in there, you'll see the other stuff you can use.
[13:47:08] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, okay. and then ? Do I unzip all these things in my local directory or just cherry-pick the files I need?
[13:47:48] <robertmaxrees> the former.
[13:48:50] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you can run a custom build if you'd like.
[13:49:20] <BobFrankly> ah, I can use a global variable to get the data out of the async callback
[13:49:25] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:49:32] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, well, I think there are too many files... imagine I use 2-3 plugins and all of them carry these amount of files
[13:49:37] <robertmaxrees> because there's no guarantee the async call will have finished by the time oyu use it.
[13:49:51] <robertmaxrees> sigdk they wouldn't all use those files.
[13:50:37] <robertmaxrees> sigdk you'd use this set of files once and then install other things on an as-needed basis.  or oyu do a custom build and include only the things you need.
[13:50:38] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, then I don't need them... I don't want to track them under git
[13:50:51] <robertmaxrees> you wouldn;'t.
[13:50:58] <robertmaxrees> you don't check in dependencies like that.
[13:51:07] <robertmaxrees> you should be using a package manager for that part.
[13:51:09] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, how do I know what's used out of all these files?
[13:51:26] <robertmaxrees> you specify that manually yourself.  you can run custom builds and only include the files you need.
[13:51:31] <robertmaxrees> but it's up to you to figure that part out.
[13:52:12] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, well, that's what I'm trying to do buy pulling only the files needed
[13:52:14] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly are you familiar with how ajax calls work?
[13:52:29] <robertmaxrees> sigdk then you'll need to spend time to figure out whcih files specifically you'll need.
[13:53:20] <sigdk> robertmaxrees, I know... and I'm wondering if I'm doing sth wrong. plus there might be a file required and I don't track the dependency
[13:53:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:54:04] <robertmaxrees> you should be using npm to track those deps and then moving things into the correct directories as needed.
[13:55:29] * hlve slaps robertmaxrees with a trout.
[13:55:33] <hlve> SUp HawtStuff
[13:55:36] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:55:47] <hlve> IM GETTING MARRIED IN 6 DAYS!
[13:56:23] <robertmaxrees> neat.
[13:58:42] <taplar_lunch> another one joins the dark side
[13:58:49] <robertmaxrees> poor bastard
[13:59:31] <taplar_lunch> lol, adds a new perspective to the star wars movies
[13:59:48] <taplar_lunch> the jedi, so lively, full of hope
[14:00:16] <hlve> =p
[14:00:32] <taplar_lunch> even the sith being restricted to one master and one pupil could be worked into the analogy
[14:01:27] <taplar_lunch> and obviously it's from a mans point of view.  cause all things are solved with a light sabre
[14:02:19] <taplar_lunch> ...... any whoo.  kudos
[14:02:29] <hlve> Thank yous!
[14:02:43] <taplar_lunch> doing the big church wedding?
[14:04:28] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: barely.
[14:04:38] <BobFrankly> I'm a powershell monkey
[14:04:53] <BobFrankly> with old faded js knowledge
[14:04:56] <robertmaxrees> so ajax calls run asynchronously.
[14:05:09] <hlve> oh god no, taplar.
[14:05:14] <hlve> Small wedding at an estate
[14:05:15] <hlve> :)
[14:05:28] <taplar> cool, that's what my sister did.
[14:05:31] <robertmaxrees> you make the call and then the js keeps running - there's no guarantee that any code after the ajax call will run after the call has finished.
[14:05:45] <BobFrankly> I got married in a hotel suite and then kicked everyone out
[14:06:04] <taplar> vegas?
[14:06:17] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly so anything that relies on the ajax call finishing needs to be in a callback.
[14:06:19] <BobFrankly> somewhere a touch classier
[14:06:23] <taplar> heh
[14:07:27] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: so I need to load a file, format the data, and feed it to chart JS for drawing on a webpage. should I be doing all that in the callback, or should I approach this from another direction entirely?
[14:07:44] <robertmaxrees> you do it all in the callback.
[14:08:36] * BobFrankly is thankful for his oversized coffee cup as he forages down this path
[14:08:44] <BobFrankly> thanks for the info
[14:08:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:09:02] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ajax/
[14:09:08] <robertmaxrees> this is a pretty good guide on the subject.
[14:09:41] <BobFrankly> yes, I read through this, but it was a few years back, maybe it'll stick this time :P
[14:13:18] <sillyslux> you might swap that code out and do .then(updateChart)
[14:13:32] <robertmaxrees> right,.
[15:37:03] <hellyeah> yo
[15:39:36] <robertmaxrees> mmod afternoon
[15:39:40] <robertmaxrees> *good
[15:49:59] <BobFrankly> trying to add an object to a pre-existing object but obviously not getting my syntax correct:   https://jsfiddle.net/ftohepzz/
[15:50:28] <taplar> Array.prototype.push
[15:50:36] <robertmaxrees> datasets is an array - need to use ^
[15:50:37] <taplar> ^ google that
[15:51:42] <BobFrankly> bwahaha....could not find dns entry for array.protoype.push
[15:52:00] <BobFrankly> chrome so annoying
[15:52:12] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:52:26] <BobFrankly> feed it an ip, and it actually tries googling it :|
[15:52:30] <patrickk> lol
[15:52:50] <patrickk> i never liked chrome due to its "cache"
[15:53:03] <BobFrankly> yeah, it's cache can make things glitchy
[15:53:18] <taplar> *shrug* our admins hate chrome with it's auto updating
[15:53:19] <robertmaxrees> yeah even when you turn it off in the dev tools it's still jank.
[15:53:20] <BobFrankly> then again, there's Edge. Which simply IS glitchy
[15:53:28] <robertmaxrees> really?
[15:53:32] <patrickk> firefox <3
[15:53:32] <robertmaxrees> i haven't had any issues with edge yet.
[15:53:49] <patrickk> taplar: You cant turn that off?
[15:53:52] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: I've hit a few sites that it simply doesn't render
[15:53:53] <taplar> nope
[15:53:56] <patrickk> darn
[15:54:04] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly 9/10 that's the fault of the site, not edge.
[15:54:25] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees: works fine in every other browser, including IE
[15:54:29] <patrickk> had it not been "google" chrome and just been chrome, that browser wouldn't have survived long
[15:54:38] <BobFrankly> they might have fixed it, was about 6 months ago
[15:54:50] <robertmaxrees> BobFrankly fwiw most other browsers are actually broken and don't follow spec.
[15:55:07] <robertmaxrees> edge (and ie11 before it) both tend to actually do what they're supposed too.
[15:55:10] <robertmaxrees> *to
[15:55:31] <taplar> *coughglobaleventobjectcough*
[15:55:50] <robertmaxrees> heh
[15:56:07] <BobFrankly> not being a web developer, I'll smile and nod
[15:59:16] <patrickk> which browser do you guys use?
[15:59:30] <robertmaxrees> FF dev edition mostly these days.
[15:59:42] <patrickk> I have been using firefox but its been taking too much memory nowadays :/
[15:59:53] <patrickk> dev edition is different from the regular?
[15:59:54] <robertmaxrees> try dev edition.
[15:59:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[15:59:58] <taplar> i prefer ff personally, but work is chrome and ff sre (i think)
[16:00:00] <patrickk> oh well thanks !
[16:00:17] <robertmaxrees> it's kind of like chrome canary plus some other built-ins.
[16:00:25] <patrickk> great thank you robertmaxrees
[16:00:36] <robertmaxrees> and $5 says the gecko replacement project will fix the memory issues.
[16:00:40] <taplar> FF ESR, got it mixed up
[16:04:28] <hellyeah> yo
[16:04:38] <hellyeah> debian has iceweasel
[16:08:17] <patrickk> dev edition creates a separate folder or uses the same firefox file path
[16:08:32] <robertmaxrees> separate folder
[16:08:37] <robertmaxrees> it's a separate application.
[16:09:01] <patrickk> ok thanks
[16:19:43] <patrickk> dev edition is nice !
[16:20:05] <patrickk> bye bye regular ff
[16:22:48] * hlve slaps patrickk with a trout.
[16:22:50] <hlve> k
[16:22:51] <hlve> I'm done
[16:22:54] <hlve> Have a good day all <3
[16:25:07] <tona> hello everyone
[16:25:09] <tona> i have one page html in one alligator.com , why it take a long time to refresh my change done in ftp ?
[16:25:36] <robertmaxrees> how long does it take?
[16:26:40] <robertmaxrees> tona
[16:27:00] <tona> 3 minutes more and less
[16:27:20] <tona> sometimes it is fast and sometime takes 3 minutes
[16:27:27] <robertmaxrees> are you clearing your cache locally?
[16:27:33] <robertmaxrees> and what kind of hosting are you using?
[16:27:40] <tona> it is into one server hosted by alligator
[16:27:42] <tona> how could i do it
[16:27:54] <robertmaxrees> clear your local cache?
[16:27:58] <taplar> ctrl+shift+del
[16:28:17] <robertmaxrees> if you're in chrome, right-click the reload icon and do the "clear cache and hard reload" or whatever.
[16:28:28] <robertmaxrees> ff on windows would be ctrl+shift+r or ctrl+shift+f5
[16:28:32] <taplar> FF has something similar if you want to dig for it
[16:28:46] <robertmaxrees> same shortcut for that menu taplar :)
[16:28:55] <taplar> ah
[16:29:02] <robertmaxrees> there's also usually an option in your dev tools to disable cache while the tools are open.
[16:29:27] <taplar> ^ that's what i was referring to with regards to the digging
[16:30:02] <robertmaxrees> ah
[16:31:20] <hellyeah> can i show my gist and get some professional ideas?
[16:31:28] <robertmaxrees> lol "professional"
[16:31:30] <robertmaxrees> sure?
[16:32:12] <taplar2> professional ideas in what regard?
[16:32:15] <sillyslux> hellyeah, debian had iceweasel
[16:32:53] <hellyeah> my gist
[16:33:11] <hellyeah> https://gist.github.com/spinningcat/2927a312d0805c82f35342f6f40d2252
[16:33:38] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:33:40] <hellyeah> i just try to prepare a docuement about what i read what i did etc.
[16:33:48] <taplar> ok?
[16:33:50] <hellyeah> to show my effort to employer
[16:33:59] <hellyeah> to get new job easily
[16:34:17] <hellyeah> how does it look? is it documented good? What do you think?
[16:34:19] <taplar> well, i'll play devil's advocate
[16:34:25] <hellyeah> sure
[16:34:29] <hellyeah> go ahead please
[16:34:32] <taplar> as an employeer, how do i know you didn't just throw together a bunch of links?
[16:34:47] <robertmaxrees> ^
[16:34:56] <robertmaxrees> this doesn't tell me that you learned anything.
[16:36:12] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah so you're trying to get a better job?
[16:36:32] <hellyeah> yes
[16:36:34] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:
[16:37:07] <robertmaxrees> okay.  so throwing together a gist that's trying to say you read a bunch of things, you instead need to show that you know how to do the job.
[16:37:14] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://github.com/spinningcat check this out pls and Robdgreat
[16:37:16] <hellyeah> ops
[16:37:18] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:
[16:37:35] <hellyeah> my codes are in github
[16:37:45] <sillyslux> oh i just remembered some turkish i've learned once... otuzbir cekijormuzin?
[16:37:54] <robertmaxrees> so what's one project that you're particularly proud of?
[16:38:31] <hellyeah> sillyslux:  this is stupid :D just say do you masturbated instead?
[16:38:35] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  just a sec
[16:38:39] <sillyslux> hehe
[16:40:12] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  https://github.com/spinningcat/PersonOnDuty
[16:40:29] <hellyeah> btw i am just trying to be better
[16:40:45] <hellyeah> if you have a tough criticism pls just do it
[16:40:54] <robertmaxrees> first off.
[16:40:57] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/spinningcat/PersonOnDuty/tree/master/js
[16:41:02] <robertmaxrees> don't check in deps basically ever.
[16:41:05] <hellyeah> that will give me a way to make things better
[16:41:22] <robertmaxrees> you should be using a package manager and scripts to copy them into the correct locations.
[16:41:27] <sillyslux> a few days ago i've read https://medium.com/javascript-scene/how-to-land-your-first-development-job-in-5-simple-steps-4e9fb73314c#.1mps0pqzk
[16:41:28] <robertmaxrees> but don't check in dependencies.
[16:41:42] <sillyslux> quite discouraging... but true
[16:41:45] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/spinningcat/PersonOnDuty/blob/master/js/PersonOnDuty.js
[16:41:53] <hellyeah> don't check in deps basically ever. dont know what that means
[16:41:57] <hellyeah> can you explain?
[16:42:25] <robertmaxrees> sure - do you know what a dependency is>
[16:42:27] <robertmaxrees> *?
[16:43:05] <hellyeah> well when you install a package
[16:43:16] <hellyeah> it will search for necessary packages
[16:43:23] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:43:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:43:24] <hellyeah> this necessary package is dependencies
[16:43:41] <robertmaxrees> right - okay - so you should never make those apart of your codebase in git,.
[16:43:47] <robertmaxrees> like... you don't check in jquery yourself.
[16:44:06] <hellyeah> together?
[16:44:13] <robertmaxrees> at all.
[16:44:13] <hellyeah> all of them in one file?
[16:44:16] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:44:23] <robertmaxrees> you don't add those files to your project period.
[16:44:29] <hellyeah> ic
[16:44:37] <hellyeah> just link of those file
[16:44:39] <hellyeah> ?
[16:44:43] <robertmaxrees> or a package manager.
[16:44:53] <robertmaxrees> like npm.
[16:45:02] <hellyeah> you mean package.json
[16:45:04] <hellyeah> _
[16:45:05] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:45:05] <hellyeah> ?
[16:45:10] <robertmaxrees> that's NPM
[16:45:10] <hellyeah> aha
[16:45:14] <hellyeah> dependency injection
[16:45:24] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:45:28] <robertmaxrees> that's a little different.
[16:45:32] <hellyeah> how?
[16:45:43] <robertmaxrees> npm just manages packages, dependency injection is a way of managing how packages are used.
[16:46:31] <taplar> heh, i got vendor stuff commited in one of my repos.
[16:46:39] <hellyeah> well i have to learn how to use npm first
[16:46:48] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah then learn how to use it :)
[16:46:49] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  thanks for that
[16:46:58] <hellyeah> i will do it as soon as i can
[16:47:06] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/spinningcat/PersonOnDuty/blob/master/js/PersonOnDuty.js
[16:47:09] <robertmaxrees> this is really... weird.
[16:47:15] <hellyeah> hmm how weird?
[16:47:19] <robertmaxrees> lots of global vars.
[16:47:30] <robertmaxrees> bad formatting.
[16:47:56] <hellyeah> well these are not global right?
[16:48:00] <robertmaxrees> they are.
[16:48:06] <hellyeah> i mean i covered whole with (functiion()
[16:48:07] <robertmaxrees> if they're not scoped to a var...
[16:48:19] <robertmaxrees> each of those functions is global.
[16:48:30] <hellyeah> oh i see
[16:48:32] <taplar> a method called from within a scope, does not mean all the variables those methods used are scoped down
[16:48:48] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find(":selected").text() - you repeat this line a few times.  just call it once and save it to a var instead.
[16:48:58] <hellyeah> do you suggest me to use function expression?
[16:49:04] <taplar> ln 57, ln 127, those are global
[16:49:15] <robertmaxrees> wrap it with an IIFE, sure.
[16:49:18] <hellyeah> well taplar warned me about that few times
[16:49:31] <hellyeah> "assign to a variable"
[16:49:33] <robertmaxrees> there's a particular way to use them.
[16:49:39] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest('body').find('.datePicker').last().find('.from').attr('disabled', false);
[16:49:41] <robertmaxrees> no.
[16:49:47] <hellyeah> i dont know IIFE
[16:50:00] <hellyeah> wrap it with IIFE
[16:50:00] <robertmaxrees> (function() { /* your code here */ }());
[16:50:16] <hellyeah> well i used $(function()
[16:50:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:50:30] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i pasted ;)
[16:50:33] <taplar> for just one small part
[16:50:37] <robertmaxrees> $(function() {}); is a document ready.
[16:50:40] <hellyeah> btw
[16:50:42] <sillyslux> ?
[16:50:47] <robertmaxrees> and you're only using it to call some functions.
[16:50:50] <sillyslux> new to me, thx
[16:50:53] <hellyeah> i just tidied up my code in jsfiddle
[16:51:10] <robertmaxrees> (function() {}()); gives you a one-time-use scope.
[16:51:18] <robertmaxrees> but won't wait until document ready.
[16:51:23] <hellyeah> okey i will wrap all functions
[16:51:42] <hellyeah> and their call
[16:52:00] <hellyeah> actually iput my js at the end of body
[16:52:10] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really matter which you do.
[16:52:14] <hellyeah> i supposed the thing of document.ready is to await until dom load
[16:52:15] <robertmaxrees> but don't have global vars.
[16:52:16] <robertmaxrees> it's bad.
[16:52:33] <hellyeah> even for function?
[16:52:35] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:52:40] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[16:52:43] <robertmaxrees> for any object.
[16:52:53] <hellyeah> i see
[16:53:00] <robertmaxrees> unless there's a really good reason for them to be global.  which 99% you won't have.
[16:53:33] <taplar> if you can pass arguments vs raising scope, pass arguments
[16:53:38] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[16:53:53] <taplar> it's more modular
[16:54:02] <hellyeah> raising scope you mean expanding right
[16:54:05] <robertmaxrees> and prevents naming collisions
[16:54:21] <taplar> raising = increasing
[16:54:26] <taplar> or expanding, sure
[16:54:32] <hellyeah> naming collision you mean two functions with same name
[16:54:38] <hellyeah> taplar:  i see what you mean
[16:55:31] <hellyeah> thanks for sparing time
[16:55:35] <sillyslux> later tonight... see if your editor can do the code styling and linting for you
[16:55:50] <hellyeah> well
[16:55:56] <hellyeah> i will use sublime
[16:56:04] <hellyeah> i have video series to learn sublime
[16:56:05] <taplar> i actually made babel wrap my concatenated files with an IIFE, heh
[16:56:21] <taplar> sorry, gulp
[16:56:26] <hellyeah> taplar:  you are advanced
[16:56:43] <patrickk> one thing I noticed about the firebug in ffdev, is when you right click any element and inspect with firebug, it starts with the <body> tag highlighted instead of the element I clicked (which used to happen in the reg ff)
[16:56:54] * taplar is in that terrible phase where he is learning stuff and tries to find any excuse to talk about it
[16:57:02] <hellyeah> robertmaxrees:  appreciated
[16:57:16] <hellyeah> taplar:  this is not what i meant
[16:57:22] <hellyeah> actually made babel wrap my concatenated files with an IIFE, heh
[16:57:26] <taplar> i'm just remarking, :)
[16:57:32] <hellyeah> this looks advanced stuff
[16:57:33] <hellyeah> :D
[16:58:01] <hellyeah> well i have to learn npm soon
[16:58:06] <taplar> it's all relative.  once you start digging in and learning it, it's cool
[16:58:21] <taplar> i mean, we all thought tieing our shoes was a big deal once upon a time
[16:58:43] <hellyeah> taplar:  i am not the same guy şn the day i came here and asking newbie question :p
[16:58:46] <taplar> then you find velcro and your like, wtf did i learn to tie things?
[16:58:56] <taplar> and then slip ons and woah!
[16:58:58] <taplar> ;)
[16:59:08] <hellyeah> well you tought me a lot
[16:59:23] <hellyeah> literally you are helping me in language also in algorithm
[16:59:37] <taplar> i'm teaching you language?  oh good lord
[16:59:46] <hellyeah> :D
[16:59:51] <hellyeah> thats exaggeration
[16:59:52] <hellyeah> :p
[16:59:52] <taplar> southern guy teaching language, heh
[16:59:58] <hellyeah> you just showed me the way
[17:00:18] <hellyeah> you gave me the tool
[17:00:22] <hellyeah> i did catch the fist
[17:00:25] <hellyeah> fish*
[17:00:26] <hellyeah> :D
[17:00:31] <taplar> good deal
[17:00:58] <hellyeah> this stupid idiot manager
[17:01:14] <hellyeah> tried to become motherfucker
[17:01:27] <taplar> woah dude, chill man
[17:01:30] <hellyeah> but hey i will have a very good job soon
[17:01:41] <hellyeah> sorry taplar
[17:03:16] <hellyeah> good night
[17:03:22] <patrickk> lol
[17:08:48] <carpii> on this stack overflow, someone suggests sorting a selector of divs, using $("div").sort( sort_fn ).  It seems to work, but I cant find any reference to jQuery.sort() ?   What am I missing?
[17:08:57] <carpii> oops, forgot stackoverflow link... http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6133723/sort-divs-in-jquery-based-on-attribute-data-sort
[17:10:26] <taplar> i'd have to check the prototype.  jQuery returns an 'array like object'
[17:10:34] <taplar> it may be that the Array.prototype methods are available
[17:11:43] <carpii> hrm
[17:12:10] <taplar> sort() is definitely available
[17:12:34] <carpii> jQuery return is usually an object
[17:12:45] <carpii> but if I look in jQuery code, it does define a .sort(), however...
[17:13:07] <carpii> 	// For internal use only.  -- 	// Behaves like an Array's method, not like a jQuery method.  -- 		sort: [].sort,
[17:13:36] <carpii> so I guess its proxying it to the equivalent Array method, but as its internal I shouldnt be using it
[17:14:27] <taplar> *shrug* it's exposed so, heh, dunno how you can say it's internal
[17:14:56] <carpii> wel, its not me saying its internal, its jQuery :p
[17:15:24] <carpii> if I rephrase my question, I have a container of divs which I want to customSort(), but without losing the .data() array attached to each element. What would be the best way to do this?
[17:15:25] <taplar> where do you see that?
[17:15:58] <carpii> right at the bottom of "jQuery.fn = jQuery.prototype" in jquery-1.10.2
[17:16:21] <taplar> and by your question your suggesting that your losing your data() elements?
[17:17:31] <carpii> im not sure whats going on at the moment. Everything works great on all browsers, but IE11 is suffering from some issue, and Ive only just traced it to my previous sort routine
[17:17:36] <carpii> so now looking to replace that
[17:18:26] <carpii> either way, from what I can see, $(div_selector).sort()  only returns an array of sorted, elements, so I stil need to find a way to actually move them in the DOM
[17:18:40] <taplar> carpii: that comment may be for the push method, but *shrug*
[17:18:54] <carpii> hm yes, good point
[17:19:28] <taplar> you'd have to change the parent of those elements to have the new order
[17:20:52] <carpii> how to remove an element an re-add it, without any risk of the.data() being lost?
[17:21:00] <taplar> detach()
[17:21:08] <carpii> aha, lovely
[17:21:09] <carpii> tanks
[17:21:10] <carpii> thanks
[17:21:42] <carpii> and then just .append($detached_element) ?
[17:21:51] <taplar> sure
[17:21:52] <carpii> if I append them in order
[17:22:02] <taplar> or $detached_element.appendTo(...)
[17:22:05] <carpii> great Ill try that. thanks for the help :)
[17:22:39] <taplar> i'd recommend appending them all after you sort
[17:22:48] <taplar> so you get just one redraw
[17:24:33] <carpii> so loop through each sorted element, detach and then append?
[17:24:45] <taplar> no, hold on
[17:25:28] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/vetrdyst/  or something of that nature
[17:26:18] <carpii> coudl I defer the detach until after the sort?
[17:26:25] <carpii> Ill try it anyway, thanks
[17:26:28] <taplar> sure
[17:26:36] <carpii> its for a userlist in a chatroom, so its likely to change frequently
[17:26:53] <taplar> sort should be pretty quick.  but sure
[17:26:57] <hellyeah> you assign to variable with detach() method
[17:27:10] <taplar> true that could be one line
[17:27:22] <carpii> would I need to assign, ,since Ive already got a sorted array?
[17:27:43] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/vetrdyst/1/
[17:27:46] <carpii> or you mean do detach().sort().append() ?
[17:27:58] <carpii> sweet, thats nice
[17:27:59] <carpii> thanks
[17:28:05] <taplar> iirc sort() returns the sorted array.  it doesn't change the original array
[17:28:13] <carpii> yeah thats what Im seeing too
[17:28:34] <hellyeah> is it called chaining right?
[17:28:39] <taplar> yep
[17:29:05] <taplar> which is cool, so long as it doesn't hurt readability
[17:29:25] <hellyeah> i see
[17:29:48] <hellyeah> this may be off topic
[17:29:58] <hellyeah> but what do you think about TypeScript?
[17:32:32] <taplar> i don't have any familiarity with it
[17:32:56] <hellyeah> okay
[17:33:15] <hellyeah> what is the suitable version of jquery for ES&?
[17:33:29] <carpii> i like what typescript tries to achieve
[17:33:42] <taplar> ES&?
[17:33:44] <carpii> just I dont like a build chain when Im hacking away
[17:34:20] <hellyeah> es6
[17:34:33] <hellyeah> sorry for that
[17:34:36] <taplar> none.  implementation of es6 isn't wide enough yet
[17:34:50] <taplar> present state you most likely want to use a compiler to compile down to es5
[17:35:09] <taplar> afaik
[17:35:31] <carpii> yeah, node has only jst got some ES6 features, and I accidentally used them in a shared server/client script
[17:35:38] <carpii> even chrome just shits the bed
[17:35:38] <hellyeah> jquery has version 3.*.* now
[17:35:52] <hellyeah> taplar:  babel
[17:36:03] <taplar> babel will do compiling down, sure
[17:36:15] <hellyeah> transpile do it also i guess
[17:36:25] <hellyeah> webpack i am not sure
[17:37:38] <taplar> this is the gulp file that i'm playing around with right now to do my compiling and deploying: https://github.com/taplar/gulp-php/blob/master/gulpfile.js
[17:40:55] <carpii> taplar, this sort/detach/attach is working great, thanks for the help :)
[17:41:06] <taplar> sure
[17:41:35] <carpii> not to strip out all my console logs full of swear words and obscenities
[17:41:38] <carpii> now
[17:41:43] <taplar> heh
[17:42:11] <hellyeah> attach?
[17:42:21] <hellyeah> is it append?
[17:42:24] <carpii> append sorry
[17:43:11] <hellyeah> when you use remove() you remove element from dom completely
[17:43:12] <hellyeah> ?
[17:43:32] <taplar> and it cleans up cached data for the element in jquery
[17:43:44] <hellyeah> totally destroy
[17:43:50] <hellyeah> is it?
[17:43:56] <taplar> pretty much
[17:44:10] <hellyeah> what do you mean?
[17:44:29] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[17:44:31] <taplar> what part?
[17:45:05] <hellyeah> pretty much?
[17:45:16] <hellyeah> is there some cases?
[17:45:18] <taplar> oh, well you still have the jQuery object of the element, but that's it
[17:45:50] <taplar> "Similar to .empty(), the .remove() method takes elements out of the DOM. Use .remove() when you want to remove the element itself, as well as everything inside it. In addition to the elements themselves, all bound events and jQuery data associated with the elements are removed."
[17:45:53] <hellyeah> well you can still select
[17:46:00] <hellyeah> and append it to dom
[17:46:02] <hellyeah> ?
[17:46:12] <taplar> what do you mean select?
[17:46:21] <hellyeah> $('..)
[17:46:24] <hellyeah> $('..')
[17:46:33] <taplar> no, you can't do that to find the element.  it's not in the dom anymore
[17:46:35] <hellyeah> this is still object right
[17:46:48] <hellyeah> ah it is just an object somewhere
[17:47:03] <taplar> in your jQuery object or any other thing that has a reference to it
[17:49:06] <hellyeah> what i understand it
[17:49:20] <hellyeah> it is just in my jquery object with no referrence
[17:49:40] <hellyeah> like a child node that doesnt have any connection with parent node
[17:50:00] <taplar> if you do var $something = $(selector);  $something.remove();
[17:50:05] <taplar> $something is still a reference to it
[17:50:36] <taplar> however if you do not have that any where and you do just $(selector).remove();  then there is no reference to it any longer and eventually it will be garbage collected.
[17:51:23] <taplar> likewise if your $something ever goes out of scope and nothing has a reference any longer, it will be eligible for garbage collection at that point
[17:51:58] <hellyeah> $something = $(selector);  $something.remove(); $something = $(selector);  $something.detach(); thiese are totally same
[17:52:05] <hellyeah> ops
[17:52:21] <hellyeah> hmm sorry about that
[17:52:31] <taplar> remove() cleans up internally stored data regarding the element and it's children
[17:52:34] <hellyeah> var smt = $something.detach()
[17:52:36] <taplar> detach() does not
[17:52:45] <hellyeah> understood
[17:52:57] <hellyeah> detach() is like unplagged?
[17:53:03] <hellyeah> i mean unplag
[17:53:13] <hellyeah> when you append it you plug it
[17:53:22] <taplar> both are unplugging
[17:53:38] <hellyeah> i understand
[17:53:40] <taplar> remove() assumes your doing to trash it.  detach() assumes you have the intent to attach it again later
[17:53:47] <hellyeah> bur remove() is like almost destroying
[17:53:59] <hellyeah> taplar:  i see
[17:54:15] <hellyeah> also remove all datas of node include child nodes
[17:54:19] <hellyeah> detach wont do that
[17:54:31] <hellyeah> empty() is similar right?
[17:55:00] <taplar> empty is like a higher level remove()
[17:55:52] <taplar> i could go to a bookshelf, get all the books, and then remove() them
[17:55:57] <taplar> or i could just empty() the bookshelf
[17:56:57] <hellyeah> ha
[17:57:00] <hellyeah> like wipe
[17:57:08] <hellyeah> wipe all stuff immediately
[17:57:50] <taplar> just different ranges of removal
[17:58:08] <hellyeah> understood
[18:06:34] <hellyeah> good night
[18:06:41] <robertmaxrees> kbyeeeeee
[18:06:44] <BobFrankly> robertmaxrees, taplar: thanks again for the assists. conquered the beast!
[18:07:10] <hellyeah-sleep> taplar i like your style
[18:07:15] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[18:07:17] <robertmaxrees> glad to hear.
[18:07:33] <hellyeah-sleep> robertmaxrees:  also i wanna be cool like you someday :)
[18:07:42] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:07:58] <BobFrankly> powershell output to json, loadable page showing the json data in a line graph
[18:12:42] <ZoderUck>  TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
[18:13:06] <robertmaxrees> look at the object you're running .map() against
[18:13:28] <ZoderUck> o
[18:13:59] <ZoderUck> robertmaxrees, this is a very simple typescript / index.html example.
[18:14:11] <robertmaxrees> show the code.
[18:14:14] <robertmaxrees> can't read minds.,
[18:14:17] <ZoderUck> ow
[18:14:33] <ZoderUck> robertmax, this happens in the output debugger window of visual studio code
[18:14:40] <ZoderUck> but it is i think an output of tsc
[18:14:44] <robertmaxrees> ....
[18:14:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:14:57] <ZoderUck> you have tried visual studio code?
[18:15:01] <robertmaxrees> i use it every day.
[18:15:02] <ZoderUck> what is so funny
[18:15:07] <ZoderUck> ow
[18:15:10] <robertmaxrees> i can't help you if i can't see the code.
[18:15:12] <robertmaxrees> so show the code.
[18:15:40] <ZoderUck> i will zip the  wole directory moment
[18:15:47] <robertmaxrees> err.r
[18:15:51] <robertmaxrees> i don't want the whole project yo.
[18:15:56] <robertmaxrees> just show the code that's throwing an error.
[18:16:01] <ZoderUck> and i close the chrome browser and delete every coockies and cache of course
[18:16:05] <robertmaxrees> ....
[18:16:08] <ZoderUck> the code runs correctly
[18:16:10] <robertmaxrees> does this have anything to do with jquery?
[18:16:45] <ZoderUck> but when i start it in chrome  witouth any breakpoints in visual studio code, i get in the debug console that error  Error processing "scopes": TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
[18:17:00] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:17:02] <ZoderUck> maybe with the http-server ? , it is a npm serve ri use
[18:17:10] <robertmaxrees> so that means you're doing .map() somewhere.
[18:17:16] <robertmaxrees> and you're doing it against an object that doesn't exist.
[18:17:18] <ZoderUck> have you used the npm https-server or lite-server ever ever ?
[18:17:28] <robertmaxrees> i've used plenty of servers.
[18:17:32] <ZoderUck> ow
[18:17:32] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:17:35] <ZoderUck> ok
[18:17:38] <robertmaxrees> none of this is relevant to your problem.
[18:17:45] <BobFrankly> any suggested extensions for jquery/javascript in VSCode?
[18:18:14] <robertmaxrees> eslint is nice so long as you have a decent config
[18:18:23] <ZoderUck> BobFrankkly typescript with a dictionary file?
[18:18:25] <robertmaxrees> also loooove the settings sync.
[18:19:05] <ZoderUck> robert: would you program in typescript  if you need basic jquery/javascript ?
[18:19:16] <robertmaxrees> i'm not really a fan of TS.
[18:19:28] <ZoderUck> ow ok. well i hope to be one too.
[18:19:38] <robertmaxrees> i prefer facebook's flow.
[18:19:51] <BobFrankly> change live, hope crap don't break?
[18:20:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:20:14] <BobFrankly> oh wait, that was back when they were building it
[18:20:28] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:20:28] <BobFrankly> or early days
[18:20:43] <robertmaxrees> most fast and break shit is not "change live, hope crap don't break"
[18:20:45] * BobFrankly read some stuff awhile back and that was what stuck in his brain
[18:20:57] <robertmaxrees> and flow is facebook's type annotation system for javascript.
[18:21:12] <BobFrankly> ahhh
[18:21:30] <BobFrankly> "flow" = product, not procedure
[18:21:43] <robertmaxrees> right, and move fast, break shit doesn't mean "change live".
[18:21:58] <BobFrankly> or at least, it SHOULDN'T
[18:22:06] <robertmaxrees> nor did it at the time necessarily.
[18:24:37] <ZoderUck> i had a lot of issues first with timeout connecting  to port 3000
[18:25:00] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck okay?
[18:25:08] <ZoderUck> and later i did read , one needs to run chrome isolated,  seperate from the already opened chrome tabbes
[18:25:17] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:25:19] <ZoderUck> yes well that i have solved :)
[18:25:50] <ZoderUck> thanks to google and the internet, i cant find the solution now, i should have store the url
[18:25:58] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[18:27:28] <ZoderUck> robert:  https://martaver.github.io/technology/vscode-chrome-debugging/  and https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/jtarquino/2016/01/24/debugging-typescript-in-visual-studio-code-and-chrome/   and
[18:27:46] <ZoderUck> ow no 3th :)
[18:28:01] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:28:02] <robertmaxrees> okay?
[18:28:10] <robertmaxrees> what does this have to do with your problem?
[18:28:14] <ZoderUck> uh yes :)
[18:28:28] <ZoderUck> and now. since i have added  sourceMap true i have this error.
[18:28:33] <ZoderUck> now i am stuck
[18:28:40] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:28:40] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:28:47] <taplar> sounds ruff
[18:28:51] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you have a non-jquery problem then?
[18:28:53] <ZoderUck> i want to debug, and stop at the bootstrap.ts
[18:29:16] <ZoderUck> i will give you the project, very simple ,  selectId, innerHTML stuff, maybe due to javascript
[18:29:19] <robertmaxrees> no.
[18:29:21] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:29:46] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're having issues with your project setup - you need to fix that elsewhere.
[18:29:55] <ZoderUck> i mean i have uses  document.getElementById("h2Msg").innerHTML
[18:29:57] <ZoderUck> but wait.
[18:30:05] <ZoderUck> elsewhere ?
[18:30:12] <BobFrankly> you can help me debug this, you only need to download 15 files and a massive cat meme PNG
[18:30:16] <ZoderUck> aha you mean i have wrong directories. it is possible yes
[18:30:17] <robertmaxrees> ;p;
[18:30:20] <robertmaxrees> mp/
[18:30:28] <robertmaxrees> *no, i mean this is the wrong channel.
[18:31:41] <ZoderUck> robertmax, can i dcc the file?
[18:31:45] <ZoderUck> zipfile, small project
[18:31:58] <ZoderUck> or is there a zip upload website ?
[18:32:47] <ZoderUck> uh pastebin allows zip ?
[18:32:53] <ZoderUck> or i need to add a gitHub
[18:33:19] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck no.
[18:33:27] <robertmaxrees> ZoderUck wrong channel to get help for your problem.
[18:33:40] <ZoderUck> ow
[18:33:52] <ZoderUck> ships. i need to go to visual source code i gues?
[18:34:06] <ZoderUck> i am new to this  visual studio code i mean.
[18:34:22] <robertmaxrees> it sounds like you're not really sure what your actual error even is.
[18:34:46] <ZoderUck> ow hmn.
[18:34:55] <ZoderUck> i want to debug, but i cannot make it working
[18:35:00] <ZoderUck> the program itselfs works
[18:35:20] <robertmaxrees> are there errors in the native console for, say, chromne, when you're not using the remote debugger?
[18:35:21] <ZoderUck> but ok. i will try myself :)
[18:35:58] <ZoderUck> ow, then i should use  view in browser extension wait
[18:36:22] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:36:24] <robertmaxrees> what?
[18:36:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:36:37] <robertmaxrees> i'm way confused.  is this error in code that runs in the browser?
[18:36:43] <robertmaxrees> or for code that runs server-side?
[18:38:12] <ZoderUck> if u use the extension view in browser, and i press ctrl + F1, theni see the browser.  i see the correct h4 line,  the typescript/javascript is working correctly and no error.
[18:38:32] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:38:53] <robertmaxrees> so this is an error you're only getting when using remote debugging for code bound for the browser?
[18:39:01] <ZoderUck> and if i open developers tools, and console and network does not give errors
[18:39:40] <ZoderUck> uh yes, i think yes, visual studio code attached to port 3000 yes.  Might be some reference that is missing yes
[18:39:54] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you don't have something setup correctly then.
[18:40:22] <ZoderUck> yes let me check the launch and compile
[18:41:28] <robertmaxrees> which sounds like you need to get support for remote debugging for vs code. which means you need to go to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vscode to get help.
[22:04:11] <turtlepower> hi
[22:04:46] <turtlepower> if i want to use selector to return more the one object element, what would be the proper format to do this
[22:05:10] <turtlepower> $(´.myClass´) or would this just return the first element
[22:19:39] <neilpdx> turtlepower: i'm pretty sure it will apply any functions that you call to all elements on the page that are identified with class="myClass"
[22:33:46] <turtlepower> ok i think ur right seems to have made array with like classes
[22:34:55] <neilpdx> ;)
