[05:23:37] <Rockwood> hello
[05:24:23] <doria> I'm struggling with Firefox flickering during change of background-image  .... tried a bunch of google "fixes" but none work. Has anyone experienced this (on FF 52, Linux, also observable in Window$)
[05:24:38] <doria> btw... I do preload images ... ;)
[07:06:19] <uskerine> hi, has anyone used PayPal client-side JavaScript and APIs  (https://developer.paypal.com/docs/classic/products/express-checkout/) ?
[07:07:05] <uskerine> I am getting both paymentToken and paymentID, but I am wondering how could I get unique transaction ID, which is the value the user actually sees in his website. Also it seems that transaction ID is different in seller/buyer accounts?
[07:13:56] <shoky> uskerine i've used their REST api's mostly, but for any of them you should make test accounts in their sandbox and you can see more or less what the user would see. though their sandbox is full of bugs, but workable
[07:15:46] <shoky> uskerine and as for transaction ID's, iirc for every payment there could be multiple ID's - one for the sender, one for the receiver,  and maybe even more (e.g. one for the developer) tho maybe those have other names, dont remember
[07:32:53] <uskerine> shoky so it is not possible for the seller (online shop) to receive an ID with the payment so they can easily cross check against PayPal account movements?
[07:33:27] <uskerine> the idea would be that once transaction is completed in the online shop, the ID that the seller sees in their account for that payment is stored in the database
[07:33:30] <uskerine> so cross-check is faster
[07:58:52] <sonu_nk> $(".s_modal).attr("class","s_modal animated ")); 	//this is required to reset the classes.. 	after this setTimeout(function(){$(".s_modal").hide()}, 2500); not wokring
[08:09:39] <Rockwood> show the full code sonu_nk
[09:15:12] <Duikb00t-home> hola
[09:30:28] <Rockwood> Duikb00t-home, hello
[12:26:04] <uskerine> hi, anyone who has tried PayPal Express Checkout (Basic Integration) https://developer.paypal.com/docs/integration/direct/express-checkout/integration-jsv4/basic-integration/  , once payment is completed I receive paymentToken and paymentID, but none matches with transaction ID shown in merchant/seller account. Any idea on how to get as return value the transaction ID so merchant/seller can
[12:26:04] <uskerine> later cross check payments received?
[13:38:03] <shoky> uskerine: you can get more info with the paymentID here maybe https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/payments/#payment_get  and i think you also get the transaction info in the 2nd argument to the 'onAuthorize' callback
[14:01:08] <uskerine> shoky how can I read the 2nd argument?
[14:01:15] <uskerine> you mean data1, data2 and then I explore data2?
[14:33:48] <Caspan_> I am using bootstrap to make my select dropdowns look nice
[14:34:00] <Caspan_> but i am adding HTML in a modal after it has loaded
[14:34:17] <Caspan_> is there a way to have it run again after the HTML is loaded so it will process the new HTML?
[14:36:04] <uskerine> shoky, I finally got it
[14:36:07] <uskerine> It is hidden here: console.log(data.transactions[0].related_resources[0].sale.id);
[14:36:24] <uskerine> thanks a lot your URL got me into the right path
[14:37:05] <shoky> uskerine yep that's the one i meant, np
[19:50:28] <MagnusVortex> okay, plain javascript question here. I ran:
[19:50:28] <MagnusVortex> $("#correlation").val(correlation[1]);
[19:50:28] <MagnusVortex> but I know the correlation array only has one value it in. Why didn't this throw an error?
[21:01:51] <GeekMonkey> Hey
[21:02:01] <GeekMonkey> Anyone familiar with Magnific Popup
[21:02:54] <GeekMonkey> When I click on a link that I have inside my element it works fine but when I close the popup it shifts the element up
[21:03:11] <GeekMonkey> my link is inside a div with overflow: hidden
[21:03:29] <GeekMonkey> in the inspector if I remove overflow hidden then it goes into the right places
[22:11:00] <skypce> hi, have a way to extract the exact order of js files founded in a html project and minify it ? i was trying with browserify but dont keep the order of files
[23:35:18] <skypce> hi
[23:35:31] <skypce> how can i give a order to browserify
[23:35:50] <skypce> example browserify bootstrap.js jquery.js > bundle.js
[23:36:16] <skypce> it always add bootstrap instead jquery first
[23:36:38] <skypce> if i put browserify jquery.js bootstrap.js > bundle.js
[23:36:38] <skypce> same
[23:36:46] <skypce> add bootstrap first
