[00:48:59] <impliednude> https://jsfiddle.net/echfrdaw/2/ - where do I add minDate:0 to this?
[02:26:05] <Cork> impliednude: minDate is for jquery-ui date picker, and you're not using that
[03:08:14] <Koopz> if you want html5 validation + AJAX POST, do you usually have a submit button in your form, listen for the form's submit event and then just e.preventDefault?
[03:40:41] <Cork> Koopz: yes, you should always have those even if you don't use the build in validation
[04:02:41] <Aljone> hey guys i have some urgent issue so im here for clues.. i have wordpress website. some clients details are deleted from inputs when they while they insert them. i wonder what could it be? for me all work fine but yet there is an issue. trying to figure out what is it
[04:22:21] <Cork> Aljone: that question is impossible to answer generically
[04:22:44] <Cork> only option is trying to reproduce it (ex. by contacting a user that has the problem)
[04:42:42] <impliednude> let minDate = new Date(0); let dateStart = new Date(overflow.start.value); let dateEnd = new Date(overflow.end.value); doesn't change datepicker to allow today forward
[04:43:04] <impliednude> it still shows and allows past days
[04:43:10] <impliednude> What am I doing wrong?

[05:05:32] <inthl> I have a problem with datatables, combined with columnDefs': [{'className': 'never' ... and the responsive extension. when using never on the 0,1,2,3 colums, to have for example, contents loaded there which are supposed to be hidden from the user, I seem unable to use the responsive extension there, since once a lower breakpoint kicks in, one can not see the (+) sign any more to expand the row, since it is affected by 'never' for colum
[05:05:32] <inthl> n 0
[05:06:54] <inthl> is that normal, or is there anything else on how to hide the first few colums, while having the responsive (+) shown correctly?
[05:57:01] <_skatman> hello all
[05:57:21] <_skatman> this is not a jQuery question per se but more of a jQuery plugins recommendation one
[05:58:12] <_skatman> is there a jQuery plugin which allows for a dropdown to be made sortable (as in, sort alphabetically by asc/desc order) as well as it would allow me to filter out items as I start typing
[08:55:54] <tripledouble> Hello, can anyone recommend a responsive table plugin that also has pagination? I am currently using tablesaw but it does not have pagination, and I can't add scrolling to it either because it breaks it. Any suggetions?
[08:56:33] <Woet> datatables is pretty popular
[09:02:54] <Kev-> datatables seconded.
[09:15:31] <tripledouble> Anyone know if I can use DataTable for pagination only?
[10:08:04] <Teduardo> Do you guys have a goto library that you use for international phone number formatting? I have seen several different ones lately. Normally there is a country dropdown that sets the country code and then a text box for the rest of the number.
[10:08:32] <Teduardo> Is there a standard for plugin/library for that or does everyone just roll their own?
[10:18:07] <Cork> Teduardo: you normally don't need a lib for that, just a list of country codes
[11:35:19] <tripledouble> Hello, anyone have any experience with tablesawy (responsive tables)? How can I add scrolling or pagination to it without breaking it?
[11:36:21] <taplar> is that a jquery plugin?
[11:49:39] <berlusco> just a heads up that it seems jquery's blog was compromised https://blog.jquery.com/2017/10/26/hacked/
[11:53:52] <inthl> is it possible to selectively hide columns in the child element of datatables responsive, when the (+) sign is clicked (the child expanded)?
[11:55:02] <berlusco> quite possibly it is :) but you'd need to be more precise about what you want to achieve and how your document is structured
[11:58:46] <inthl> berlusco, well it is pretty much easy: init a datatable with the responsive extension enabled. once the (+) is clicked, it shows in its .child the colums+contents of the columns that are being hidden on that viewport
[11:59:28] <berlusco> what exactly do you mean by datatable? a regular html table or something more specific?
[12:00:07] <inthl> the datatables library, which uses jquery. afaik there is no own channel here for that, thought that maybe someone would know :>
[12:01:06] <berlusco> i am afraid i am not familiar with that particular extension. do you mean https://datatables.net/ ?
[12:01:46] <inthl> yes
[12:02:02] <inthl> thanks for trying anyway :>
[12:02:16] <berlusco> well :)
[12:02:39] <berlusco> i have no idea what it does to the table when you call the function on it ....
[12:03:20] <berlusco> but could you maybe hide the td's individually? sort of $('tr td:nth-child(N)').hide()
[12:03:31] <berlusco> just a wild guess
[12:04:10] <berlusco> or maybe https://datatables.net/reference/api/column().visible()
[12:10:13] <inthl> hm
[13:08:47] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeee
[13:32:06] <Teduardo> Howdy, if signup is a form id why does this fire an event when the form is submitted: $('#signup').validationEngine();
[13:32:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:32:43] <robertmaxrees> Teduardo could you clarify?
[13:33:03] <Teduardo> shouldn't it be like $('$signup').submit(function[blah blah blah] etc?
[13:33:17] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:33:23] <Teduardo> okay nevermind dude.
[13:33:28] <robertmaxrees> #signup is how you select by ID.
[13:34:07] <robertmaxrees> validationEngine looks like it's getting bound and handling the form the way you're asking it to.
[13:34:08] <Teduardo> yeah, I understand that. I am just trying to figure out why writing $('#signup').something() fires something() when the form is submitted.
[13:34:39] <robertmaxrees> because .something() is binding a handler for that.
[13:34:45] <robertmaxrees> and/or fires its own events.
[13:35:05] <Teduardo> Okay so it is somewhere listening for the submit?
[13:35:28] <robertmaxrees> that's generally how validation plugins work.
[13:35:50] <robertmaxrees> they bind a listener for submit/change/input etc. and fire.
[13:36:04] <Teduardo> So lets say for the sake of argument that you needed to bind a second thing to that submit...
[13:36:22] <robertmaxrees> .on('submit', function() {});
[13:36:40] <robertmaxrees> or do you only want that second thing to fire if the form is valid?
[13:36:45] <Teduardo> so even though validationengine is bound to it, you can add another event handler to it?
[13:37:14] <robertmaxrees> if validationEngine isn't doing anything funky with the event object, yeah.
[13:37:36] <robertmaxrees> validationengine may also take callbacks, too.  which would be ideal.
[13:37:37] <Teduardo> I suppose also there might be a way to get validationEngine to just do the thing I am trying to add the event handler to do
[13:37:50] <robertmaxrees> ^ really depends on what your second handler is doing.
[13:38:20] <Teduardo> alright thanks i'll see if anyone has already kind of sorted this out specifically with that plugin
[13:38:31] <robertmaxrees> why not check the docs?
[13:39:23] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine#onsuccess
[13:41:12] <Teduardo> yeah, thats what i'll be doing
[14:40:54] <Al_nz1> Any ideas why stopPropagation is undefined is coming up? https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/38820/ when you click into one of the inputs ?
[14:41:19] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:41:20] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:41:40] <Al_nz1> Hi robertmaxrees - not my code bTW
[14:41:51] <robertmaxrees> any reason you don't fix the real issue?
[14:42:26] <robertmaxrees> and it's because the JS is coming in after the html.  so the in-html bindings won't work.
[14:43:06] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/DTcHh/38847/
[14:43:25] <robertmaxrees> gotta change the "load type" in the javascript menu and load everything else on doc ready.
[14:43:39] <robertmaxrees> also: don't use "latest" for jquery under frameworks and extensions.
[14:44:31] <Al_nz1> Thanks for the fiddle - you wrapped the whole thing in a function?
[14:44:43] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:44:54] <robertmaxrees> i wrapped everything BUT the handler in a doc ready call.
[14:45:50] <robertmaxrees> but really, i'd just fix the code to begin with.
[14:47:01] <Al_nz1> in what way?
[14:47:19] <robertmaxrees> don't use inline event handlers.
[14:47:31] <robertmaxrees> onclick= and its ilk are A Bad Ideaâ„¢
[14:49:38] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: OK I will ask more about that in a moment. I have have moved stopProagation on my local copy outside the docready but now I get a Uncaught ReferenceError: table is not defined
[14:51:06] <Al_nz1> dont worry - fixed that
[15:04:16] <Al_nz1> One thing after another - anyone know why the tagsinput formatting isnt getting applied to the inputs : https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/38850/
[15:04:31] <Al_nz1> Tagsinput here : https://bootstrap-tagsinput.github.io/bootstrap-tagsinput/examples/
[15:26:49] <robertmaxrees> because the plugin is firing before the inputs exist.
[15:28:02] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1
[15:29:04] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I got as far as this : https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/38864/
[15:29:11] <Al_nz1> but need to get rid of placeholder text
[15:30:08] <Al_nz1> but should I have another line below the $(this).html( '<input type="text" class="form-control col-xs-12 input-sm" onclick="stopPropagation(event);" placeholder="Search '+title+'" />' );
[15:30:19] <Al_nz1> to add the data-role="tagsinput"
[15:30:30] <Al_nz1> so that it binds properly?
[15:30:36] <robertmaxrees> erm....
[15:31:12] <Al_nz1> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29703773/bootstrap-tagsinput-add-tag-with-id-and-value
[15:31:14] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:31:24] <robertmaxrees> you have to manually initialize stuff in the right order.
[15:31:30] <robertmaxrees> since you're rendering things dynamically.
[15:31:39] <Al_nz1> thats what I was getting at
[15:31:41] <robertmaxrees> that tagsinput plugin should have a refresh method or something siliar.
[15:31:41] <Al_nz1> at the input
[15:31:50] <Al_nz1> then apply the tags input plugin seperatly?
[15:32:01] <Al_nz1> I think thats whats in the SO
[15:32:25] <robertmaxrees> did you even read the docs?
[15:32:32] <robertmaxrees> the page you linked talks about your exact scenario.
[15:34:00] <Al_nz1> add method?
[15:34:18] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[15:34:27] <robertmaxrees> "refresh" being an operative word here heh
[15:34:57] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/ijAJEjd.png
[15:37:21] <Al_nz1> as simple as putting the refresh in after the each finishes : https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/38866/ ?
[15:37:36] <robertmaxrees> does that do wha3t you're looking for?
[15:39:27] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/38865/ <- that worked in so far as formatting (without having added the refresh) . Im guessing that by adding the refresh https://jsfiddle.net/DTcHh/38866/ I can actually use the tagsinput events now? (which is going to be the next step).
[15:39:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[15:40:11] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what you're trying to do at this point.  super lost.
[15:42:00] <robertmaxrees> if you were able to get the tags thing working fine before, why do you need the refresh?
[15:52:03] <Al_nz1> brb
[16:34:35] <jameshalpert101> Anyone know how to make it so my typing script that automatically types text doesn't disrupt the flow of the HTML elements? As you can see when it starts typing, the elements "Above" and "Below" snap. I'd rather "Above" and "Below" stay in the same place the entire time: http://jsfiddle.net/6r4121tn/
[16:39:17] <robertmaxrees> change the text instead of the html.
[16:39:18] <taplar> give the h2 a min-height
[16:39:30] <robertmaxrees> and use a block-level parent that maintains a specific height via css ^
[16:49:04] <jameshalpert101> robertmaxrees, ahh I'm confused.
[16:49:21] <jameshalpert101> well ok I'll try
[18:10:16] <Z3R0_Windows> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/cb71fc6fcccfa061859e5fd5cb8b912b // I am trying to create a new tab with data added to it... but it keeps overwriting the main page and does not add content to the newly created tab... thoughts?
[18:12:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/gpn9nsv6/
[18:12:46] <robertmaxrees> not seeing that./
[18:12:59] <gambl0re> HEY ROBERT
[18:13:17] <robertmaxrees> hello
[18:13:29] <gambl0re> HOWS GOING?
[18:13:35] <robertmaxrees> what's with the caps duder?
[18:13:40] <Z3R0_Windows> it's supposed to take page from (current page) create new tab and place on new page...
[18:13:43] <robertmaxrees> Z3R0_Windows are you getting any js errors locally?
[18:13:43] <taplar> cobol programmer
[18:13:50] <Z3R0_Windows> but it's taking the data... replacing the current page... and then opening a blank new tab
[18:13:54] <Z3R0_Windows> nope
[18:14:14] <robertmaxrees> Z3R0_Windows also: you can't necessarily speficy if it'll bne a new browser tab or a new window.
[18:14:17] <Al_nz1> robertmaxrees: I got it going - thanks for your input as always
[18:14:38] <robertmaxrees> Z3R0_Windows the browser controls that.  are you sure it's not opening a new tab and immediately taking you to it?
[18:14:48] <Z3R0_Windows> yes
[18:14:54] <Z3R0_Windows> I get a new about:blank new tab
[18:14:56] <robertmaxrees> humm.  i'd need to see it break.
[18:15:05] <Z3R0_Windows> and then click the previous tab and my original page has the updated data
[18:15:28] <robertmaxrees> Al_nz1 rad.
[18:16:50] <Z3R0_Windows> hmmm trying window.document.write()
[18:17:06] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you wanna avoid using that.
[18:17:11] <Z3R0_Windows> oh
[18:17:13] <Z3R0_Windows> lol :D
[18:17:15] <robertmaxrees> because 9/10 people use it wrong heh.
[18:17:26] <Z3R0_Windows> it worked though ?
[18:17:31] <Z3R0_Windows> new tab now has the data
[18:17:48] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/write
[18:18:08] <robertmaxrees> just stuff to be aware of.
[18:18:15] <Z3R0_Windows> interesting... previous tab changed too thuogh :D
[18:18:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:18:43] <Z3R0_Windows> now that's tricky
[18:18:50] <robertmaxrees> as an aside - why are you opening a new window at all?
[18:19:19] <Z3R0_Windows> opening a new "raw" print content
[18:19:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:19:30] <Z3R0_Windows> because I need to be able to print the information, and I don't need all teh navigation information
[18:19:41] <robertmaxrees> oh, use print styles for that instead.
[18:19:51] <Z3R0_Windows> it's about 8 different tables... I can't use css page-break-before ... because the parent div's float the container right
[18:20:09] <Z3R0_Windows> I do have that content set for .printable only
[18:20:12] <Z3R0_Windows> but i can't page-break it
[18:21:06] <robertmaxrees> you intending to ship this to other people?
[18:21:11] <robertmaxrees> or just for yourself?
[18:21:17] <Z3R0_Windows> for my company
[18:21:37] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you're gonna have all kinds of jank around trying to control how that prints.
[18:21:47] <robertmaxrees> 'cause people do dumb stuff with their print settings all the time.
[18:22:47] <Z3R0_Windows> well my issue is I have 26 offices... that in each table... and about 10 rows per table... so each table is like 2 pages... by itself... even if I shrink them, I may be able to get 1 table (landscape) ... but even then without a page-break it starts cutting shit off
[18:23:04] <Z3R0_Windows> sorry not rows... columns*
[18:23:06] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:23:07] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:23:28] <robertmaxrees> any reason you can't generate a pdf server-side for people to download?
[18:23:47] <Z3R0_Windows> still would be the same thign wouldn't it? or could I control what data is on EACH page of the pdf?
[18:24:15] <robertmaxrees> if you have a way to generate PDFs in your backend without using HTML, you can do whatever you want.
[18:24:30] <Z3R0_Windows> hmmm... know anything free? lol :D
[18:24:38] <Z3R0_Windows> not opposed to that :D
[18:24:59] <robertmaxrees> https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2017/04/headless-chrome is one way.
[18:25:28] <robertmaxrees> there are other ways to make pdfs that don't involve using a browser.
[18:26:00] <robertmaxrees> but if you need a special version of the page for printing, I'd just render out the page from the server that way.
[18:26:04] <robertmaxrees> instead of making something using JS.
[18:26:26] <robertmaxrees> because your code makes some assumptons that aren't necessarily true - like for me it opens a new window and not a new tab.
[18:31:03] <Z3R0_Windows> ya I just didn't want to requery to create that page
[18:31:12] <Z3R0_Windows> I'll come back Monday, g2g
[18:42:49] <VectorX> anyone know if there is a channel for mediaelement.js questions ?
[18:58:01] <robertmaxrees> VectorX google search doesn't bring anything up.
[18:58:41] <VectorX> robertmaxrees I wasnt able to find anything on it
[18:58:53] <robertmaxrees> bummer.
[19:42:00] <FishPencil> What even do those dynamic dropdown's normally  bind to? keyup?
[19:44:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:45:24] <robertmaxrees> FishPencil which dynamic dropdowns?
[19:45:38] <FishPencil> Like the search boxes that search for you as you type
[19:45:55] <robertmaxrees> Ah.  Input's a good one.
[19:46:01] <robertmaxrees> keyup is another option.
[23:31:20] <C129> I have a form set up for a user to input data. What's the best way to pass those inputs to a javascript function?  Would I have to get the val() of each individual field?  There's also a checkbox I'll need to iterate through
