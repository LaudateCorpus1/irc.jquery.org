[00:04:24] <intellilogic> I have a 2 lists and I am using Jq UI Sortable "connected lists" ('connectWith'), instead of received, I am using update, so when I move an item around on the same list, I can store it's order.  When I move an item from 1 list to the next, it fires twice!  I'm considering putting an exit statment in receive to resolve this.  Thoughts?
[00:36:51] <djQuery> intellilogic, yes once for an item being removed and once for an item being place
[00:37:06] <djQuery> intellilogic, have you looked at done
[01:16:07] <jamieshepherd> Hi, I have <input> followed by <menu></menu> - Can I do something like $(this).parent().$('menu').toggle(); inside a focus function?
[01:18:06] <jamieshepherd> Example : http://jsbin.com/doyodije/1/
[01:27:36] <frank_o> jamieshepherd: theres gotta be a better way but: http://jsbin.com/doyodije/2/edit
[01:28:35] <jamieshepherd> Yeah there was frank_o : http://jsbin.com/doyodije/3/edit :)
[01:28:41] <jamieshepherd> Just wasn't targeting the right level
[01:31:00] <frank_o> jamieshepherd: cool
[01:31:10] <frank_o> jamieshepherd: doesnt seem to remove the button properly on exit though
[01:32:17] <jamieshepherd> Yeah I don't think I want to have it hiding once it's shown
[01:32:25] <jamieshepherd> Looked at how Facebook status works, there's just stays there once it's openm

[01:34:17] <jdo_dk> If i have a function like: first_func, with a $.get inside, and i want to trigger a second function, when the $.get inside first_func is "done" can i use somekind of events or should i just do like: first_func... $.get(... second_func() ) ?
[01:50:06] <Bogdaniel> hey everyone i have some text appended to a modal window using jquery and everything that was appended doesn't get any css styling any ideas?
[02:09:49] <jdo_dk> bogdaniel: Doesnt sound right.
[02:19:48] <yonghan79> Hi all,i need a help.i want to get data-attribute from shown isotope js item to filter price.is it possible to do that?thanks
[02:24:09] <intellilogic> $('#foo').something({ a:function(){ /* How to exit here so 'b' doesn't fire? */ }, b:function(){}
[02:27:16] <sacho_> exit? fire?
[02:27:24] <sacho_> those are function definitions
[02:27:47] <sacho_> if you want to define those conditionally, you can't use a literal, really

[03:04:47] <frank_o> I'm trying to do some stuff on scroll end: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zc5V5/1/

[03:11:35] <FrEaKmAn_> hi.. does anyone know how jquery ui draggable offset rounding works?
[03:11:44] <FrEaKmAn_> is it round, cell, floor?
[03:55:05] <fattest> How can i make my javascript function work to convert my money units? http://jsbin.com/fonem/1/edit eg if i type 2898 (copper) into the text box, i need it to convert gold, silver and bronze, where 100 copper = 1 silver; 100 silver = 1 gold
[03:56:56] <systemfault> modulo (%) is your friend.
[03:58:49] <frank_o> maybe money.js + accounting.js too
[04:08:45] <fattest> systemfault: why isn't my math.round not working? http://jsbin.com/fonem/2/edit
[04:09:29] <fattest> systemfault: if i type a big number, eg 34343434, i'll get something like 343.43434. i want it to show 343 (round down)
[04:12:33] <fattest> any help?
[04:13:22] <fattest> never mind, math .floor works
[05:02:42] <fattest> can someone please help me, my equation is not working out. 100 copper = 1 silver; 100 silver = 1 gold. but if i type 10000 (copper), it shows 0 gold, 100 silver, and 0 copper, when it should be 1 gold, 0 silver, 0 copper. please have a look http://jsbin.com/fonem/2/edit
[05:16:35] <jamieshepherd> Hi, if I introduce new elements to the DOM, such as a new <li> item, can I get jquery to animate all these in by default (e.g. fade)
[06:45:28] <marel> I have 5 <a> elements. One of them contain "active" class. How do I get this element ?
[06:50:45] <flam_> $('a.active')
[07:20:29] <R13ose> hi
[07:25:12] <R13ose> Using this jQuery plugin: https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-mousewheel ID CSS is width: 7000px; and the body is overflow-x: hidden but doesn't scroll to the left.  My code is here: http://pastebin.com/sWTgsxDw  Example site basing off of: http://deanoakley.com/  Any ideas on how make scrolling left work?
[07:30:49] <jimroberts> djQuery_: i read over your 2 links and sadly still isn't sinking in
[07:31:32] <djQuery_> jimroberts, just create a function that accepts the values that you need to do the calculation.
[07:31:54] <djQuery_> jimroberts, just however parameters the calculation needs as inputs
[07:32:10] <R13ose> djQuery_: do you want me to pm you my site so you can what I am trying?
[07:32:20] <jimroberts> what?
[07:32:29] <djQuery_> have it output the text you want added to the div
[07:38:53] <jimroberts> djQuery_: I'm not sure I could, I will have to keep working on it I guess
[07:39:41] <jimroberts> I will have to see if I can catch an old friend see if he can expalin to me what I don't understand. Seems something in all of this is just eluding me
[07:47:01] <R13ose> jimroberts: I wasn't here when you asked your question.  Maybe if you say this again, others can help?
[07:50:35] <jimroberts> R13ose: http://jsbin.com/haguhede/4/edit < this does what I am after
[07:51:09] <jimroberts> R13ose: http://jsbin.com/rexiduze/8/edit <this one doesn't, while I haven't put in my code the issue is that all the input boxes I am trying ot use have the same name
[07:51:20] <jimroberts> What I am trying to do is some basic math stuff
[07:51:52] <jimroberts> When you put in a number in the box, it gets the current value then figures out the cost of that, then figures out the cost of what you want and then it returns the amount you need to spend to get what you want
[07:52:38] <jimroberts> djQuery_ was trying to help me learn what "this" is but its just not working for me. he did give me some stuff that did kinda give what I was after
[07:53:05] <jimroberts> I'm just about to the point of saying bleh, and offering a buddy $5 to write it up for me
[07:55:11] <R13ose> jimroberts: I get to that point sometimes too.  In #8, I don't see any math happening
[07:55:26] <jimroberts> I didn't put it in
[07:55:48] <jimroberts> In the #4, I create the div then update it as needed
[07:55:53] <jimroberts> in #8 I couldn't figure that out
[07:56:25] <jimroberts> so on page load in #4 I create the div I want to use, and then on keyup in the input box I do the math and then update the div
[07:58:19] <R13ose> jimroberts: lots of information
[07:59:00] <jimroberts> a side note, more issues is that I am creating a chrome extention with all of this
[07:59:11] <jimroberts> so I had a fair amount of learning on this project
[08:00:18] <R13ose> jimroberts: maybe you need to break this down and go piece by piece and learn what everything does.
[08:00:47] <jimroberts> Thats how I built the first one
[08:01:09] <jimroberts> but the issue here is more then 1 input I need to work with that has same name
[08:01:10] <R13ose> jimroberts: well built that again
[08:02:08] <jimroberts> If I could use something like $('[name=amt][0]').after('<div id="MS1"></div>'); and $('[name=amt][1]').after('<div id="MS2"></div>');
[08:02:16] <jimroberts> then I think i could do it
[08:02:31] <jimroberts> djQuery_ was saying to do everything THEN build the div
[08:02:45] <jimroberts> but that doesn't make sense to me, but about that time he was asking what "THIS" is
[08:02:49] <jimroberts> and I didn't understand that
[08:03:21] <djQuery_> jimroberts, I will take of this you just take care of that
[08:03:41] <djQuery_> what values do you need to be able to do the caclulation?
[08:04:16] <jimroberts> from the #8 I need Weapons Capacity - the 140,000 and what ever I put in the input box
[08:05:32] <R13ose> jimroberts: does this help: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2627813/how-to-get-an-array-with-jquery-multiple-input-with-the-same-name
[08:05:54] <djQuery_> then write a function that accepts those values as parameters
[08:06:10] <yonghan79> Hi all,i'm using isotope and range filter to fillter product price,i got it working.and i want to filter only shown div.thanks
[08:06:15] <djQuery_> have it do the calculate and do a return of the text you want in the div
[08:06:31] <yonghan79> Is it possible to do it?thanks
[08:08:23] <jimroberts> So change $('[name*=amt]')
[08:08:36] <jimroberts> then how do I select 1,2or3?
[08:09:54] <jimroberts> djQuery_: was that what you wanted to know?
[08:12:32] <djQuery_> jim you dont forget the stupid page write 3 vars
[08:12:46] <djQuery_> i give up
[08:12:48] <djQuery_> later
[08:16:32] <frank_o> Hi! I'm trying to do some stuff on scroll end: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zc5V5/1/
[08:16:35] <frank_o> But how come I can't detect scroll end after loading jQuery Mobile? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zc5V5/2/
[08:19:40] <jimroberts> thanks for trying djQuery_
[08:21:15] <R13ose> jimroberts: did you read the url I gave you?
[08:21:34] <jimroberts> yes
[08:21:43] <R13ose> jimroberts: thoughts?
[08:23:39] <jimroberts> R13ose: tbh still lost i'm going to step away from it and ponder on it
[08:24:03] <jimroberts> I guess I should work more on getting the values more then trying to get the div created
[08:24:43] <R13ose> jimroberts: div's created is easy if I understand correctly.  You should try and get the values, yes.
[08:28:50] <R13ose> frank_o: if you are trying to make the alert work for me in jsfiddle this is not showing the alert in either ones.
[08:31:23] <frank_o> R13ose: The first one should work after you've scrolled to the bottom
[08:32:52] <frank_o> R13ose: Do you see it?
[08:33:08] <R13ose> frank_o: yes worked now.
[08:33:15] <frank_o> Great
[08:38:08] <R13ose> frank_o: what is pagecontainershow?
[08:39:01] <frank_o> R13ose: jquery mobile
[08:39:19] <frank_o> pagecontainershow runs code after the page has been loaded - http://api.jquerymobile.com/page/
[08:43:15] <R13ose> frank_o: when I run the code using jQuery Mobile 1.4.2 two scrollers appear
[08:44:37] <frank_o> R13ose: Can I see?
[08:44:51] <R13ose> frank_o: does that happen to you?
[08:45:06] <frank_o> same fiddle or did you do anything to it?
[08:45:52] <R13ose> frank_o: jsfiddle #2 of yours with no change just clicked the checkbox and hit run.
[08:46:01] <frank_o> what checkbox?
[08:46:15] <R13ose> frank_o: the one that says jQuery Mobile 1.4.2
[08:46:28] <frank_o> no you dont need to do that, jquery mobile is already added under "External resources"
[08:47:20] <frank_o> i added it there so i could use jquery mobile without its themes
[08:47:35] <frank_o> (structure only css as it's called)
[08:51:56] <R13ose> frank_o: not sure what is going on
[08:56:09] <krennel> can someone help me? I put a script for magnific popup for gallery. I want to add the retina code but it not works (example on the official site is a code for image without gallery). In this code pen i write in html the code that works for my galleries and in js the code that I am not able to know where and how to implement to the gallery http://codepen.io/anon/pen/DJmbt
[08:57:20] <R13ose> frank_o: from my research maybe you need to add e, ui but that is a guess.
[09:00:50] <R13ose> krennel: that is very small code and doesn't really do anything.
[09:01:03] <R13ose> seems my question was thrown out the window again
[09:57:58] <paulvd> hello, trying to make isotope work here, but not working at all ? http://dev.primerevenue.com/resources/#
[09:58:55] <paulvd> dont see any error in console as well
[10:09:24] <peterR``> how can I add an onclick handler for a range of elements?
[10:09:31] <peterR``> do I have to do something like $('#q').click(function(event)
[10:09:35] <peterR``> ...
[10:09:47] <peterR``> for each one individually?
[10:10:19] <RandalSchwartz> $('.someclass').click(...)
[10:10:30] <RandalSchwartz> that would add the handler for all elements matching that class
[10:11:02] <RandalSchwartz> I rarely use IDs any more, because there can be only one element with a given ID.
[10:11:58] <peterR``> I need to know which element was clicked
[10:12:33] <RandalSchwartz> in your handler, that's "this"
[10:12:40] <RandalSchwartz> use $(this) to get it as a jquery
[10:12:41] <jimroberts> R13ose: Well I now have the numbers I need to start with, so time to work on the math part, however I still need to figure out the keypress item..
[10:13:10] <RandalSchwartz> the event arg also has some details, but I rarely use that
[10:14:10] <R13ose> jimroberts: good
[10:15:34] <Ohga> I'm figuring out how to use chains of Deferred objects. I want to handle a failure from each of two steps, and I want to run some cleanup after no matter if it succede or fail. Is this, http://pastebin.com/KLFWUYru , correct?
[10:16:07] <Ohga> obviously, I shouldn't run both functions that handle errors..
[10:16:49] <peterR``> so should I be doing something like: var c = $(this).innerHTML;
[10:17:26] <RandalSchwartz> $(this).html()
[10:17:38] <RandalSchwartz> if you want to stick with jquery's way
[10:17:49] <RandalSchwartz> ensure portability that way
[10:18:34] <RandalSchwartz> .text() would give the text portion
[10:20:30] <R13ose> in jQuery is this right to do: event.preventDefault(); for disabling y scrolling until I have scrolled all the way over with x?
[10:25:24] <znf> Could I manipulate (or at least, query) an iframe's contents?
[10:35:17] <jimroberts> R13ose: well I have my math formula figured out, all 2(1 is the same as the other), however I still need a way to know which input I am interacting with
[10:36:01] <jimroberts> djQuery_: is there a way to do check what is in the pervious td when interacting with an input?
[10:37:08] <djQuery_> jimroberts,  $('inputselector').parent('td').prev();
[10:37:34] <jimroberts> inputselector(would that be the "this")
[10:37:57] <djQuery_> jimroberts, or if you are allready in some kind of click handler or something instead using the slector again just use $(this)
[10:38:18] <jimroberts> Well I am going to use keyup..
[10:38:40] <jimroberts> so it will be interacting with my input, I just need to look at the pervious TD and see what the hidden value is
[10:38:52] <jimroberts> then I can do an if statement to chose which math formula to use
[10:41:29] <jimroberts> well this didn't work
[10:41:30] <jimroberts> 	$("[name=amt]").keyup(function(){ 		var whichinput = $(this).parent('td').prev().text(); 		("body").append('<div>Fleets: ' + whichinput + '</div>'); 	});
[10:42:28] <djQuery_> jimroberts, remember because of their bad code just 1 prev is going to get you their hidden label
[10:42:46] <jimroberts> djQuery_:  I am after there hidden label
[10:42:59] <jimroberts> each one is different that tells me which one I am working with
[10:43:02] <djQuery_> the input is after
[10:43:21] <djQuery_> oh ok
[10:44:12] <djQuery_> jimroberts, what game?
[10:44:23] <djQuery_> are you just making this a user script?
[10:44:36] <jimroberts> hmm I am looking at this and the hidden input isn't in a TD
[10:44:41] <jimroberts> it is a user script
[10:44:46] <djQuery_> im hacking this one right now myself http://www.multiverseminer.com/
[10:45:24] <jimroberts> this one is http://gatewars.com
[10:45:39] <jimroberts> well hmm
[10:45:46] <jimroberts> it turns out the hidden input isn't in a TD
[10:47:09] <jimroberts> hmm it won't create a div
[10:50:19] <jimroberts> djQuery_: could you explain this to me: $('[name="amt"]').each(function(i, elm){ };
[10:50:31] <jimroberts> is there a counter with that?
[10:50:45] <jimroberts> so each one it goes to I could have it edit the html?
[10:51:02] <jimroberts> say add a class=ms1, class=ms2, class=ms3
[10:57:34] <jimroberts> djQuery_: something like this?
[10:57:34] <jimroberts> 	$('[name="amt"]').each(function(i, elm){ 		$( "[name=amt]" ).addClass("MS" + (index + 1)); 	});
[10:57:50] <djQuery_> jimroberts, yes 1 is the index that it was returned by the css selector
[10:57:55] <djQuery_> exactly
[10:58:36] <jimroberts> well something broke..
[10:58:41] <jimroberts> it won't load on that page anymore
[10:59:32] * djQuery_ facedesk
[11:00:03] <jimroberts> hmm it doesn't like 	$('[name=amt]').each(function(i, elm){ 		$( "[name=amt]" ).addClass("MS" + (index + 1)); 	});
[11:00:43] <djQuery_>  $('[name=amt]').each(function(i, elm){   $(elm).addClass("MS" + (index + 1));  });
[11:01:17] <jimroberts> AH Well I kinda got it
[11:01:28] <jimroberts> all 3 got the same classes
[11:01:38] <jimroberts> class="MS1 MS2 MS3"
[11:01:51] <djQuery_>  $('[name=amt]').each(function(ind, elm){   $(elm).addClass("MS" + (ind + 1));  });
[11:02:11] <jimroberts> oh elm = element
[11:02:21] * jimroberts facepalm
[11:02:22] <hives> hey all, anyone got any good references to learn jquery
[11:02:42] <djQuery_> jimroberts, noticed i renamed i and index
[11:03:11] <djQuery_> hives, http://learn.jquery.com/
[11:03:19] <hives> thanks alot
[11:05:07] <R13ose> I got my question figured out.
[11:11:58] <djQuery_> jimroberts, dang server still hasn't sent me an email confirmation of my login yet
[11:12:26] <jimroberts> I dont know much about it
[11:12:33] <jimroberts>  know at times it can be slow
[11:12:36] <jimroberts> ok wtf!!
[11:12:42] <jimroberts> still not creating my divs lol
[11:12:53] <jimroberts> So I don't know if its doing my math or not
[11:13:04] <djQuery_> are you using console.log to output the data at least?
[11:13:07] <tandroid> hives: Learning javascript will make jquery pretty easy.
[11:13:27] <djQuery_> tandroid, +++
[11:14:32] <tandroid> hives: I've been reading "Professional JavaScript for Web Developers" and I highly recommend it to anyone learning js
[11:14:37] <djQuery_> jimroberts, the one I am playing has 1 js file that is 20756 lines long
[11:14:42] <hives> thanks alot
[11:14:44] <TheoMurpse> Hi. I have an XML response from an AJAX request with elements called xsd:element that have attributes like saw-sql:aggregationRule. How do I .find() these with jQuery? I've tried .find('xsd\\:element') but that doesn't return anything. That's what the jQuery docs say you should do, though.
[11:15:08] <jimroberts> say what djQuery_
[11:15:12] <jimroberts> thats crazy
[11:15:31] <djQuery_> http://www.multiverseminer.com/
[11:16:16] <jimroberts> ok so yeah this won't update
[11:16:17] <jimroberts> 	$(".MS1").keyup(function(){ 		var currentweapons = weapons; 		var requestedweapons = $(this).val(); 		var newweapons = currentweapons + requestedweapons; 		var costtogetweapons = ((((newweapons*(newweapons+1)/2)-(0*(0+1)/2))*10000)-((currentweapons*(currentweapons+1)/2)-(0*(0+1)/2))*10000); 		$("#WeaponCapacities").html("Weapon Capacity Increase is: " + requestedweapons + ".<br>New Total Weapon Capacity is: " + newweapons + ".<br
[11:17:29] <jimroberts> oh I got it
[11:17:41] <jimroberts> I deleted a different keyup that was there
[11:18:49] <frank_o> Hi! I'm trying to do some stuff on scroll end: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zc5V5/1/
[11:18:52] <frank_o> But how come I can't detect scroll end after loading jQuery Mobile? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zc5V5/2/
[11:19:08] <djQuery_> jimroberts, dont think that will work currentweapons wont be the right value
[11:19:27] <jimroberts> yeah its coming in a string
[11:19:32] <jimroberts> I just tried to parseInt()
[11:19:35] <jimroberts> but still won't work
[11:20:07] <djQuery_> just copy and paste it into a jsbin please
[11:20:14] <djQuery_> the table and the script
[11:20:21] <djQuery_> I dont care about any css
[11:20:30] <jimroberts> 1 sec
[11:21:05] <djQuery_> tired of ......
[11:22:48] <jimroberts> http://jsbin.com/rexiduze/9/edit
[11:23:38] <tandroid> frank_o: I don't know for sure, but I think that jquery mobile treats the data-role="page" div as the window as far as scrolling goes.
[11:23:48] <tandroid> Notice the overflow-x: hidden;
[11:26:02] <frank_o> tandroid: Interesting! However nothing seems to happen when forcing `.ui-page { overflow-x: visible !important; }`
[11:26:56] <tandroid> frank_o: http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/mobile/fixed-position/
[11:28:37] <tandroid> I can never remember exactly how it works. I just know there is some weird stuff going on there ha.
[11:28:39] <frank_o> tandroid: What do you mean? I mean I read that page a while back and locally I'm using jQM's fixed toolbars
[11:29:02] <jimroberts> djQuery_: I don't know why it doesn't work. I can do math weapons variable
[11:29:12] <tandroid> frank_o: Well, all I'm saying is that scrolling in jquery mobile isn't like normal scrolling.
[11:29:20] <frank_o> hehe yeah its super odd im really dreading having to dive into jqm's css
[11:29:32] <frank_o> true that
[11:30:24] <djQuery_> jimroberts, is the calculation different for each one?
[11:30:42] <jimroberts> 2 of them are the same
[11:30:43] <tandroid> frank_o: man I know. It's frustrating. Which is why I don't user jqm!
[11:30:44] <jimroberts> 1 is different
[11:30:50] <djQuery_> jimroberts, the first one was working for me before I edited like crazy
[11:31:03] <jimroberts> I made a change and mine stopped working
[11:31:09] <jimroberts> no when i sent ya the link
[11:31:13] <jimroberts> it wasn't doing it correct
[11:31:20] <jimroberts> it wasn't adding what it should have
[11:31:28] <jimroberts> so to start we had 400001 if I put in 1
[11:31:32] <jimroberts> I got 4000011
[11:31:37] <jimroberts> not 400002
[11:32:03] <jimroberts> see here
[11:32:03] <jimroberts> Weapon Capacity Increase is: 11. New Total Weapon Capacity is: 40000111.
[11:34:47] <djQuery_> http://jsbin.com/rexiduze/12/edit
[11:35:57] <djQuery_> jimroberts, but i made all 3 the same
[11:36:12] <jimroberts> hmm
[11:36:29] <jimroberts> Mine it seemed didn't like the requested weapons variable
[11:36:48] <jimroberts> Yours has the same error
[11:36:57] <jimroberts> put in 10 into the first input
[11:37:11] <jimroberts> notice the New Total Weapon Capacity is:
[11:37:22] <jimroberts> its the orginal amount + the number you put in, but not added together
[11:38:19] <tandroid> Oh my
[11:38:46] <djQuery_> jimroberts, $(elm).addClass("MS" + (ind + 1) + ' djquerywashere').data('oldvalue', elm.value);
[11:38:57] <jimroberts> var newweapons = currentweapons + requestedweapons; << that isn't doing the math
[11:39:22] <jimroberts> I just changed requestedweapons to a number so it was var newweapons = currentweapons + 11;
[11:39:23] <mouses> i'm using font-size in em units and all fonts are consistent on desktop browsers. mobile chrome is spazzing out though, randomly big and small
[11:39:25] <jimroberts> and it still gave me an error
[11:39:42] <djQuery_> jim then later you can do var currentweapons = $(this).data('oldvalue');
[11:39:52] <djQuery_> corse need to parse int on that stuff
[11:41:07] <djQuery_> jimroberts, http://jsbin.com/rexiduze/14/edit
[11:41:52] <jimroberts> its adding 100 or something, and a new div everytime lol
[11:42:21] <tandroid> djQuery_, jimroberts: somebody fix that error!
[11:42:30] <tandroid> the semicolon.
[11:43:12] <djQuery_> tandroid, look at my newest one there is no console error
[11:43:20] <djQuery_> http://jsbin.com/rexiduze/14/edit
[11:43:46] <djQuery_> dont understand why this isnt removing the div before adding it though $this.closest('td').remove('.mystuff').append('<div class="mystuff">' + t + '</div>');
[11:43:48] <tandroid> there is an error at the bottom of the js editor
[11:44:01] <tandroid> line 18 missing simicolon
[11:44:14] <djQuery_> k done
[11:44:39] <jimroberts> Its not using the old data
[11:44:43] <jimroberts> grr
[11:44:46] <jimroberts> the starting weapons
[11:45:18] <tandroid> can I ask what is trying to be accomplished here?
[11:45:41] <djQuery_> jimroberts, it thinks they are strings you are going to have to parseInt them first
[11:46:05] <jimroberts> djQuery_: whats the proper useage on that?
[11:46:19] <jimroberts> parseInt(VAR, 10);
[11:46:20] <jimroberts> ?
[11:46:26] <djQuery_> yes
[11:46:33] <tandroid> I feel like this project is in need of better structure.
[11:46:58] <frank_o> dont we all
[11:47:27] <jimroberts> Nope
[11:47:29] <jimroberts> still not working
[11:47:32] <tandroid> If you could define what the different data types are, it could help make the code more readable and maintainable.
[11:47:36] <jimroberts> I don't get it, I did the SAMETHING before
[11:47:53] <tandroid> Is that out of the question djQuery_  and jimroberts?
[11:48:06] <jimroberts> what do you mean tandroid?
[11:48:12] <jimroberts> djQuery_: this one works as is
[11:48:12] <jimroberts> $("[name=amt]").keyup(function(){ 		var currentup = cleancuparray[0] - 1; 		var requestedup = ($(this).val() * 3); 		var newup = currentup + requestedup; 		var newupcorrect = newup+1; 		var costtoget = (15000*((newup)/3)+(15000*((((newup)/3)-1))*((newup)/3))/2)-(15000*((currentup)/3)+(15000*((((currentup)/3)-1))*((currentup)/3))/2); 		$("#UPupgrade").html("UP Increase is: " + requestedup + ".<br>New Total UP is: " + newupcorrect +
[11:48:27] <jimroberts> I just copied the same concept into this one
[11:48:33] <jimroberts> but its just not working
[11:48:41] <djQuery_> jimroberts, k it not doing that anymore http://jsbin.com/rexiduze/14/edit
[11:48:48] <djQuery_> only 1 div
[11:48:51] <tandroid> I mean that this code is a mess. you are solving problems incrementally rather than defining the overall problem and coming to a solution.
[11:49:09] <tandroid> This will continue to be a mess and take you way longer to complete/
[11:49:25] <jimroberts> Weapon Capacity Increase is: 123. New Total Weapon Capacity is: 123123. Cost is: 757963515000000
[11:49:36] <jimroberts> tandroid: if I knew something better I would try
[11:49:45] <tandroid> jimroberts: I'm willing to help you
[11:49:45] <jimroberts> incrementally is the only way I know how
[11:49:58] <tandroid> But we would need to take a step back and just talk about what you are trying to do.
[11:50:07] <jimroberts> Ok
[11:50:19] <jimroberts> I play a game and we are trying to help some newer players
[11:50:33] <jimroberts> by creating an chrome extetion that does basic maths for us
[11:50:34] <jimroberts> So
[11:50:46] <jimroberts> I got the unit production on working
[11:51:09] <jimroberts> basicly i get the value we already have, and then based on the number inputed into the box do some math and shove it into a div I added to the page
[11:51:21] <jimroberts> So I moved onto the MS page
[11:51:29] <jimroberts> but I found that all 3 inputs have the same name
[11:51:37] <jimroberts> so I could use the same tatics to get it
[11:51:52] <mouses> i'm using font-size in em units and all fonts are consistent on desktop browsers. mobile chrome is spazzing out though, randomly big and small
[11:51:57] <jimroberts> so I, with the help of djQuery_, found a way to add the divs and defive which input box I am working with
[11:52:02] <jimroberts> define*
[11:52:17] <jimroberts> but for some reason I can do maths on the orginal weapons count
[11:52:24] <jimroberts> But I can't add the input value to it
[11:52:36] <jimroberts> brb
[11:53:15] <yonghan79> Hi all,is it possible to combine .not() with .map()?thanks
[11:54:04] <djQuery_> jimroberts, what the heck is this?  (0*(0+1)/2)
[11:54:12] <tandroid> jimroberts: so I think we should split this up into three parts.
[11:54:16] <tandroid> The first part just gets the data from the page and stores it into objects/arrays.
[11:54:35] <tandroid> The second would do the math and return the information to the object.
[11:55:01] <tandroid> the third part would be listening for events and actually be manipulating the dom.
[11:55:30] <yonghan79> Like http://pastebin.com/qXgfaxqa
[11:55:32] <djQuery_> (0*(0+1)/2) = 0
[11:58:42] <yonghan79> http://pastebin.com/GeZN0AKz
[11:59:01] <yonghan79> Thanks
[12:00:52] <djQuery_> well he's gone now
[12:01:24] <tandroid> He said he'd be back.
[12:01:35] <tandroid> I'm still trying to figure out how this can be done efficiently.
[12:01:41] <tandroid> The short answer is it can't ha
[12:02:04] <tandroid> just because none of these tables really have any unique identifiers.
[12:09:07] <jimroberts> djQuery_: it is the way to get the cost from the start. tbh i just tossed it together I know I could do it better :P
[12:09:12] <jimroberts> tandroid: What ever you think is best
[12:09:28] <jimroberts> I just know what I did at least gave me what I was after(well almost)
[12:09:57] <djQuery_> http://jsbin.com/rexiduze/14/edit
[12:10:10] <djQuery_> jimroberts, is this working for you now?
[12:10:28] <jimroberts> Closer
[12:10:35] <jimroberts> its not using the 400001
[12:10:48] <djQuery_> is the calculation the same for all of them? can you just be a little more generic in your wording so that you dont have to do 1 for each one
[12:12:15] <djQuery_> jimroberts, this part of the equation is always  = (0*(0+1)/2)   = 0
[12:12:54] <jimroberts> djQuery_: 2 of them use the same numbers, 1 uses a different value
[12:13:05] <jimroberts> WOOT its working
[12:14:58] <djQuery_> refresh
[12:15:03] <djQuery_> jimroberts, ^^
[12:15:22] <djQuery_> and who wrote that equation?
[12:16:44] <jimroberts> Its kinda 1 doing it twice :
[12:16:57] <jimroberts> I was just looking and I feel kinda stupid setting it up that way
[12:17:25] <jimroberts> I made it MUCH harder then it should be
[12:19:29] <mouses> i'm using font-size in em units and all fonts are consistent on desktop browsers. mobile chrome is spazzing out though, randomly big and small... i just added <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"> and it looks better (not as randomly big in font size) but its still not the same size across the page
[12:19:41] <jimroberts> djQuery_: ar costtogetweapons = ((newweapons*(newweapons+1)/2)-(currentweapons*(currentweapons+1)/2))*10000;
[12:19:45] <jimroberts> gives the same answer :S
[12:20:00] <mouses> i expect {font-size:1.8em;} to always look the same in every element
[12:20:10] <jimroberts> not sure why I doubled it
[12:20:33] <obert> emdoesnt works that way
[12:20:52] <djQuery_> mouses, cool sounds like you have a css problem and not a jquery problem
[12:21:20] <obert> em is always relative to the parent
[12:22:10] <djQuery_> jimroberts, whats that text mean in the submit boxes?
[12:22:36] <jimroberts> its value I want to add to my current value
[12:22:56] <djQuery_> in the button?
[12:26:14] <obert> mouses: you can use px nowdays anyway f you need a fixed font-size
[12:27:09] <mouses> hmm, i was always taught ems. i've been away from web dev for a little while and just got back
[12:28:43] <obert> em are good. but it is not ie6 times anymore
[12:36:40] <mouses> lol
[12:36:47] <mouses> ie6... thats prob when i was a hardcore developer
[12:44:54] <mouses> what are the mobile browsers you guys test besides chrome and safari?
[12:45:03] <mouses> wtf are the popular mobile browsers nowadays?
[12:45:08] <mouses> firefox? opera?
[12:50:00] <djQuery_> mouses, http://netmarketshare.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=0&qpcustomd=1
[12:50:53] <mouses> thx
[12:51:11] <djQuery_> ff realy only hase .68% of mobile market?
[12:51:20] <mouses> why the hell isnt chrome the default android browser?
[12:51:33] <mikechelen> it is on 4.4 i think
[12:51:37] <djQuery_> nope but I still think it uses webkit
[12:52:02] <djQuery_> or whatever they forked it to
[12:52:34] <mikechelen> part of the issue might be that aosp cannot contain copyright stuff
[12:52:48] <djQuery_> mouses, with dang phone vendor locking out updates and what not would you want your name on it?
[12:53:10] <djQuery_> asop?
[12:53:10] <mikechelen> i'm surprised safari still has such a large share
[12:53:23] <mikechelen> android open source project
[12:53:29] <djQuery_> mikechelen, damn iphone
[12:54:01] <mikechelen> djQuery_: android has been eating iphone's market share but i guess there are still tons out there
[12:54:06] <Ohga> I'm figuring out how to use chains of Deferred objects. I want to handle a failure from each of two steps, and I want to run some cleanup after no matter if it succede or fail. Is this, http://pastebin.com/KLFWUYru (where only one of the corresponding fail functions should be run), correct?
[12:55:28] <djQuery_> mikechelen, didnt like apple when they first came out with their closed hardware
[12:58:24] <mouses> holy fuck
[12:58:30] <jimroberts> djQuery_: everything is working
[12:58:34] <jimroberts> thank you for all your help
[12:58:36] <mouses> i figured out the issue was chrome mobile browser
[12:58:43] <mouses> my site looks fine in firefox mobile
[12:58:48] <mouses> fonts are all consistent
[12:58:52] <mouses> fucking chrome
[13:00:56] <mouses> had me researching the fuck out of viewports
[13:07:32] <mikechelen> djQuery_: yeah it took time for other hardware/software companies to catch up but now the fact that android is open source gives it a huge advantage
[13:08:17] <mikechelen> djQuery_: there are dozens of manufacturers making android phones now, which means a variety of models & prices to match any customer
[13:13:38] <djQuery_> mikechelen, so your telling me that I just spent how much on a new computer 1 year ago and I cant put todays faster chip in it now
[13:14:24] <mikechelen> djQuery_: yeah the hardware side is still a big problem, everything is too tightly integrated for user maintainence
[13:15:14] <mikechelen> djQuery_: having android exist means some other company could make a swappable hardware platform, and still have an OS to install on it
[13:15:18] <djQuery_> mikechelen, I can understand it for a phone but me and my dad were uprgading pc back when mem was 100 a meg
[13:15:26] <mikechelen> a good mobile linux distro would be nice too though
[13:15:55] <mikechelen> djQuery_: there is no reason a phone could not be made modular, at least for certain parts
[13:16:27] <djQuery_> I want something that can store a list of all my installed programs and just loop through the list and run apt-get install on all of them
[13:16:51] <mikechelen> to some extent the technology changes so fast though that after a couple years when you want to upgrade the cpu, you would want more memory, new screen, new sensors anyway
[13:16:55] <djQuery_> even more annoying on the phone
[13:17:15] <mikechelen> djQuery_: you can do that with a backup program like ti
[13:17:34] <mikechelen> djQuery_: alternatively people are working on open source android app repos like fdroid
[13:17:37] <djQuery_> mikechelen, all it needs to store is the list of programs
[13:18:05] <mikechelen> djQuery_: im pretty sure there are several ways of doing that, in fact google play store will reinstall your old apps if you tell it to
[13:18:55] <djQuery_> mikechelen, problem with them is that you cant ever remove one from the store if you didnt like it or at least I havent seen how to do it
[13:19:49] <mikechelen> djQuery_: huh i think if you uninstall an app it will not try to restore that one
[13:26:14] <mouses> wow, just checked multiple android browsers and chrome looks like 95% good, firefox 100% good, dolphin bad, opera bad
[13:48:11] <proxy> help

[14:33:32] <Zisef> background-color: #eee;
[14:33:34] <Zisef> opps
[14:33:37] <Velveeta> you probably need more jquery in your firewall, so you've come to the right place
[14:33:48] <Zisef> yeah what he said
[14:34:11] <Zisef> Need to get it in the firmware if you know how to flash.
[14:34:12] <proxy> well
[14:34:34] <proxy> learning
[14:34:47] <proxy> was gonna do it today
[14:34:49] <Velveeta> have you done any work with jquery firmware development?
[14:35:03] <proxy> but they won't let me hook up the int
[14:35:12] <proxy> no
[14:35:29] <proxy> I'm a layman
[14:35:59] <proxy> I'd say call me but it's not saeff
[14:36:10] <Zisef> You do know apps get sent information and if you have one blocked from incoming they will keep trying to reach the app right?
[14:36:35] <proxy> \mmmmm.... not tooo much
[14:36:41] <Zisef> Its quite normal to see alot of incoming requests. my log is full of them
[14:37:11] <Zisef> Like autoupdates.
[14:37:13] <proxy> oaky, so let them ome in willy nilly
[14:37:33] <Zisef> Did you finger your port
[14:37:34] <proxy> they want the keys
[14:37:36] <Velveeta> how did you get root access to the internet if you don't even know jquery firmware development? did you hack that from somebody else?
[14:38:04] <proxy> told you,  they left them in my comp
[14:38:10] <proxy> Adobe I rthkng
[14:38:28] <proxy> when theyy were installing Adobe CC

[14:38:51] <proxy> yeah right
[14:39:06] <Zisef> You know adobe cc is a cloud service right
[14:39:18] <proxy> I'm a noob
[14:39:19] <Zisef> Means incoming and outgoing communication
[14:39:22] <proxy> not a moron
[14:39:55] <proxy> 12 hours to download isn't right
[14:40:09] <Zisef> Reformate
[14:40:25] <proxy> and the shit that was tere besided the keys ....
[14:40:33] <proxy> damn'
[14:40:41] <Velveeta> ok, i was originally having fun with this, but now i'm gonna stop feeding the troll.. or feeding as the troll.. depending on the perspective
[14:41:05] <proxy> made me with I studied compputers
[14:41:14] <proxy> *wish
[14:41:49] <proxy> Oh thank you for NOT takingpity on me
[14:42:08] <mouses> if you guys write some epically great js code, do you ever simplify it to make it nonreadable, to protect it from being copied?
[14:42:08] <proxy> I know one thing
[14:42:17] <proxy> I am not crazy
[14:42:27] <proxy> I am being pursued
[14:42:55] <proxy> and NO one has the balls to fucking help me
[14:43:15] <Zisef> You have no idea what you are talking about
[14:43:15] <proxy> well I will leve you with this:
[14:43:35] <Zisef> All access root key you are either a troll or a great imagination.
[14:43:45] <proxy> Doctors and nurses have taken an oath for centuries
[14:44:00] <proxy> it's why you can trust them
[14:44:09] <proxy> to help heal you
[14:44:19] <proxy> and not make goat babies
[14:44:34] <proxy> it all boits down to 3 words
[14:44:43] <proxy> DO NO HARM
[14:44:51] <proxy> do no harm guys
[14:44:55] <proxy> peace
[14:47:03] <Velveeta> what the fuck was that.. i don't even..
[14:47:32] <Velveeta> mouses: we don't obfuscate our code for IP protection purposes, but we do minify/uglify it for deployment purposes, just to shrink the size of the assets
[14:47:43] <Velveeta> it has a similar effect, but for a different reason
[14:49:09] <Zisef> Its Javascript its a given mouses.
[14:50:08] <mouses> do you ever care if people try to copy your js?
[14:50:16] <mouses> if its some epic algorithm
[14:50:30] <tw2113> if i somehow did that much in js, i'd be more than fine with sharing it
[14:50:34] <jParkton> if you care, hide it
[14:51:12] <Velveeta> the nature of js is that it lives in the browser (aside from node).. if you put it out there, it can be stolen, despite how well you try to obfuscate it
[14:51:20] <Velveeta> especially if you're talking about an algorithm itself
[14:52:23] <tw2113> if someone wants my js code, i hope they're willing to take on what it requires to maintain :D
[14:53:44] <Velveeta> heheheh
[14:54:37] <tw2113> just sayin'
[15:01:42] <el_inventor> hi.
[15:01:51] <el_inventor> i need help :(
[15:05:42] <el_inventor> I'm doing an educational softwtare using  html and jquery 1.11.1, but, the cpu overload
[15:07:57] <el_inventor> addition, the cache is saturating the browser cahe
[15:08:17] <UserError> Then use famous
[15:08:32] <UserError> Every job has a best tool
[15:08:58] <el_inventor> How I can clear the cache with jquery?
[15:10:01] <UserError> you mean removeData? http://api.jquery.com/removedata/
[15:11:26] <jParkton> el_inventor: that is not the way to do it
[15:11:41] <jParkton> Let the browser handle cache not JS
[15:12:57] <jParkton> you can window.location.reload(true)
[15:13:10] <jParkton> but best to let the browser work that out
[15:14:31] <el_inventor> jParkton: is that everything in the browser freezes, unresponsive :(
[15:15:12] <jParkton> Inf loop
[15:15:36] <jParkton> look in your resources tab
[15:15:41] <jParkton> what is working it
[15:18:20] <el_inventor> I see that the cores are at 100%
[15:19:44] <Velveeta> that could be any number of things, but probably not the cache
[15:19:54] <Velveeta> an overutilized cache would spike your memory, not cpu
[15:24:30] <el_inventor> is that two things, the first is that changes I do not apply when wiped cache, was solved
[15:26:38] <frank_o> Hi! I'm trying to do some stuff on scroll end: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zc5V5/1/
[15:26:41] <frank_o> But how come I can't detect scroll end after loading jQuery Mobile? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zc5V5/2/
[15:27:22] <el_inventor> la segunda, es lo de la cpu, estoy trabajando con la librería ionSound, pero cuando, ejecuto varios efectos, deja de responder, el cpu se sobrecarga y se salta los efectos
[15:27:47] <el_inventor> Velveeta: sorry, the second is about the cpu, I'm working with ionSound library, but when I run multiple effects, stops responding, the cpu is overloaded and the effects skips
[15:28:34] <Velveeta> how many are you trying to run at once? like against what size of a jquery collection?
[15:31:45] <el_inventor> es bastante, es una aplicación de accesibilidad, para personas con discapacidad visual. estoy trabajando con la libreria "ionSound" para reproducir los sonidos
[15:31:54] <el_inventor> is enough, is an accessibility application for visually impaired persons. I am working with the library "ionSound" to play sounds
[15:31:59] <el_inventor> Velveeta: is enough, is an accessibility application for visually impaired persons. I am working with the library "ionSound" to play sounds
[15:32:51] <Velveeta> i don't know anything about ionsound, but i do know that if you have extensive operations going on per node, and you're operating on a large collection of nodes, it's going to hang your browser... you need to revisit your approach if that's the case, to something a little more scalable
[15:32:58] <el_inventor> sorry I do not speak English, I am translating with translate.google :/
[15:33:50] <el_inventor> Velveeta: http://ionden.com/a/plugins/ion.sound/en.html
[15:37:46] <el_inventor> Velveeta: esta librería tiene in metodo para detenerla, pero los de más efectos al parecer se encadenan y se mezclan
[15:37:53] <el_inventor> method in this library has to stop, but apparently most effects are chained and mixed
[15:45:31] <HenriettaSalt> Newbie question: How do I string together a selector that is looking for .plan-button and #update_card? Stringing them together in either order isn't doing it..
[15:54:40] <el_inventor> Velveeta: a question, what library to play sounds I recommend?
[16:19:05] <sarkis> hey all, so i am doing a $('#someform').unbind().submit(); inside of an ajax call if the form is validated, i basically want it to post as normal if it's valid.. problem is the backend does a HttpRedirect to a new page and i do see the GET /new/page in my server but browser never renders the new page
[16:28:57] <sarkis> i suspect e.preventDefault() is still trumping the GET ^
[16:49:31] <frank_o> tandroid: You were right man
[16:49:48] <tandroid> frank_o: about what?
[16:49:58] <frank_o> tandroid: I'm able to detect scroll end when binding to $(document) instead of $(window) in jquery mobile: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/Zc5V5/20/
[16:50:26] <tandroid> Ah right!
[16:50:51] <tandroid> Nice, well I'm glad you got it working.
[16:54:13] <frank_o> tandroid: Thanks!
[16:55:19] <Numline1> good evening gents, I I'm having some troubles with .addClass when used with Colorbox. When I add it to my code (to Colorbox popup) it stops working all together
[16:55:26] <Numline1> To be more specific, here's my code:
[16:55:37] <mouses> is there a good chrome html validator that runs during js code execution after page has loaded?
[16:55:39] <Numline1> 	jQuery.colorbox({href:'/user/custom-register', open:true, iframe:false, width:600, height:500,overlayClose: false, escKey:false});
[16:56:01] <Numline1> when I append .addClass('colorbox-node');, it stops displaying the popup
[17:04:42] <Hyperking> is there a way to have a "load more articles" for a static site?
[17:04:53] <Hyperking> "load more articles" are normally dynamically connected to a database which queries the next set of articles similar to pagination ( without the click )
[17:05:31] <Numline1> Hyperking, you can split your page into divs of content and load them after clicking on a link
[17:05:50] <Numline1> If it's all static, you can hide those divs and show them with each click
[17:07:05] <Hyperking> numline1: yeah, but wouldn't the browser have to load every posts? were talking 200+ articles here
[17:07:41] <Numline1> Hyperking, well, if it's static, it has to be loaded at first, of course
[17:08:00] <Numline1> Or you can append additional content from annother files, there's a lot of possibilities
[17:08:18] <Hyperking> yeah I think the latter is best bet
[17:08:26] <Hyperking> .load().appendTo()
[17:09:02] <Hyperking> the pages containing the articles are static index1.html
[17:09:11] <Numline1> Hyperking, sure, if you create good logic for that, you can use load() to append them as well
[17:11:20] <Hyperking> I would need to iterate the file number for every click...i guess this would work
[17:15:22] <Numline1> Hyperking, if you have the content split between files, that's an option, if you don't, you can load certain amount of elements with each click
[17:15:35] <jParkton> why not make routers?
[17:15:47] <jParkton> in Ember or Backbone or something
[17:16:37] <Hyperking> jParkton:hmmm...didn't think of that and i've been looking for a reason to play with backbone
[17:16:54] <Hyperking> although i would have went to angularjs
[17:16:55] <jParkton> its like three lines to route your content and BAM
[17:17:01] <jParkton> ready to deploy
[17:17:55] <Hyperking> cool. will look into that as well, my content is in separate files
[17:18:20] <jParkton> thats fine
[19:07:35] <Aggelos> hello! can i ask an question about jquery mobile & jquery infinite scroll?
[19:07:59] <tandroid> Aggelos, if you want to.

[19:11:12] <tandroid> Aggelos, can you paste an example of how you're doing the infinite scroll?
[19:12:05] <Aggelos> i am doing with infinite-scroll(dot)com plugin
[19:12:09] <Aggelos> i am using wordpress
[19:12:46] <tandroid> Hyperking: it should be. it's in the ECMAScript 3rd Edition which includes ie8.
[19:12:54] <Aggelos> Content Selector: #content, Navigation Selector: #nav-below, Next Selector: #nav-below a:first, Item Selector: .post

[20:09:26] <scar> what's the best way to have things move or do things as the user scrolls them into view?
[20:09:53] <Okee> Is there a channel fro jQtouch library?
[20:31:57] <Aggelos> Can anyone help with jquery mobile?
[20:47:39] <fattest> how can i add text to the beginning and end of each line in my textarea after clicking a button? http://jsbin.com/vahahe/1/edit please provide an example.
[20:50:12] <oniMaker> Does jQuery provide a way to 'extend' an object via prototype inheritance?
[21:03:17] <systemfault> oniMaker: No, JS has a way though
[21:03:45] <oniMaker> systemfault: yeah, went with resig's simple js inheritance for this
[21:09:34] <jorvis> Does anyone know of a control or plugin which allows you to scroll through items in an <ul> using the up/down arrow keys?  (ideally with pagination?)
[21:13:55] <copperhands1> anyone enjoy the new Aaron Schwartz doc?
[21:16:00] <jorvis> What is it?
[21:17:07] <copperhands1> The Internet's Own Boy
[21:17:10] <copperhands1> A documentary
[21:17:23] <jorvis> Ah, haven't seen it
[21:17:46] <copperhands1> Just watched it, I didn't realize he was so involved in stopping SOPA
[21:24:24] <motaka2> hello to extend a plugin I should just use $.extend ? I mean I need inheritence
[21:27:58] <systemfault> extend just copy props from X objects to another
[21:33:47] <motaka2> systemfault: So what is the best way to add some functionality to an existing plugin ?
[21:37:08] <thinkxl> motaka2: adding your own methods to the plugin, but it depends if the API is friendly
[21:37:40] <thinkxl> fork the project and do your modifications
[21:37:58] <motaka2> thinkxl: I wrote those plugins and I need to extend them. How can I write friendely APIs for plugins?
[21:38:19] <thinkxl> motaka2: with design patterns
[21:38:45] <thinkxl> http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/
[21:40:42] <motaka2> thinkxl: Thx
[21:41:00] <thinkxl> np
[21:42:16] <motaka2> I was looking for a quicker way actually but I book marked that page
[21:42:49] <thinkxl> well, adding methods, and giving a method only one task, and that that task doesn't depends on external methods
[21:44:33] <thinkxl> well I would need to see your code to actually give you some good advice
[21:46:11] <motaka2> thinkxl: It is just a general question. I was just thinking how I can add a new function to $.fn.SomePlugin
[21:46:46] <thinkxl> without touching the actual code of the plugin?
[21:47:02] <iArivu> hi guys. Need help on parsing HTML string
[21:48:16] <motaka2> thinkxl: Yes
[21:48:19] <thinkxl> iArivu: what you need to extract?
[21:48:51] <thinkxl> motaka2: mh... don't think there is a jQuery method for that, I think you will need to create like another plugin that requires the original plugin
[21:48:57] <iArivu> i have a styled text which is bulletin text with <b> tag text
[21:49:16] <iArivu> as the browser parse the bulettin text
[21:49:20] <motaka2> thinkxl: How can I do that?
[21:49:26] <iArivu> it consider the <b> tag as text
[21:49:47] <thinkxl> motaka2: just create another plugin, and check if the first plugin is in the global scope, if not, throw an error
[21:49:49] <mbuf> I am trying this example http://codequizzes.wordpress.com/2013/07/10/creating-a-rails-api-and-making-requests-with-jquery-ajax/ with Rails 4.1 and the last step in jQuery doesn't return the result from the table. What could I be missing?
[21:49:59] <iArivu> can i get what i am saying? thinkxl
[21:50:15] <iArivu> can u get?
[21:50:33] <thinkxl> iArivu: you are getting <b> as string
[21:50:38] <iArivu> yes
[21:50:40] <thinkxl> "<b>text</b>"
[21:50:42] <thinkxl> like that?
[21:50:47] <iArivu> yes
[21:50:50] <motaka2> thinkxl: Can you give me an example?
[21:51:22] <thinkxl> iArivu: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1499889/remove-html-tags-in-javascript-with-regex
[21:52:01] <iArivu> let me try thinkxl
[21:52:21] <iArivu> but i am need to parse the <b> tag
[21:52:49] <thinkxl> look at this
[21:53:04] <thinkxl> iArivu: http://jsbin.com/mebuqato/1/edit?js,console
[21:54:12] <thinkxl> uArivu: try just like this: var yourString = "<b>text</b>".replace(/(<([^>]+)>)/ig, "");
[21:54:26] <iArivu> actually its bunch of text
[21:54:31] <iArivu> give me a min
[21:54:44] <thinkxl> where are you getting that text from?
[21:55:28] <iArivu> from a DB
[21:55:50] <thinkxl> motaka2: not really, but just check if your window.plugin exists if it does, then just let the plugin go, if not, run an error ASAP
[21:56:25] <thinkxl> iArivu: oh oh ok you want to show that text in bold actually
[21:56:41] <iArivu> yes your right
[21:57:31] <thinkxl> iArivu: try this https://github.com/jamiesonbecker/safify.js
[21:58:28] <iArivu> cant we do that without plugin?
[21:58:40] <iArivu> already ia m using lot of plugins :)
[21:59:13] <thinkxl> sure, check the plugin source code, is very clear
[21:59:34] <thinkxl> check line 42 and 43
[21:59:56] <thinkxl> but is weird that jQuery doesn't take "<b>" and render it as HTML
[22:00:08] <thinkxl> how are you inserting the text ? with .text();
[22:00:09] <thinkxl> ?
[22:00:22] <iArivu> html()
[22:00:35] <thinkxl> can you upload your code to take a look?
[22:00:42] <thinkxl> because like this I'm just guessing
[22:03:05] <iArivu> WRB
[22:12:38] <sir> Having a issue with elem not hiding when mouse leave. http://jsfiddle.net/9wj5B/  any hints ?
[22:15:27] <motaka2> thinkxl: thx
[22:15:36] <thinkxl>  sir: what is the $('ul.' + elem_class).stop() for?
[22:19:46] <SoulRaven> hello
[22:20:12] <SoulRaven> exists any plugin for displaying weeks of a year?
[22:20:24] <SoulRaven> with settings, for monday first?
[22:21:33] <thinkxl> sir: the HTML and the JS is a mess and everything in the JS is targeting the wrong elements
[22:21:48] <thinkxl> sir: is this your code, or just copy/pasted?
[22:22:25] <iArivu> thinkxl here is the updated http://jsbin.com/mebuqato/3/edit?html,output
[22:23:25] <sir> Its mine
[22:23:59] <sir> the stop i added because I was told it would improve animation glitches
[22:24:37] <thinkxl> iArivu: just like this works http://jsbin.com/mebuqato/4/edit
[22:25:21] <thinkxl> iArivu: Author is bold
[22:25:59] <iArivu> but alignment missing thinkxl look this http://bayimg.com/oApAAaafe
[22:26:15] <iArivu> that would be my final output
[22:27:28] <iArivu> u got what i mean? thinkxl
[22:33:02] <thinkxl> iArivu: is difficult without seeing how are you getting the data from the server or how you are handling that
[22:33:55] <iArivu> thinkxl u have any idea about sharepoint?
[22:34:07] <thinkxl> no
[22:34:15] <iArivu> its from sharepoint
[22:34:24] <iArivu> so it as plain string
[22:34:26] <thinkxl> for curiosity, that <b>Author</b> is not inside some <pre> or <code> tags?
[22:34:39] <iArivu> yes your right
[22:35:04] <thinkxl> that is why
[22:35:15] <thinkxl> you need to remove those tags from there
[22:35:37] <iArivu> ok then
[22:36:00] <thinkxl> glad we can figure out, check if that fix the issue
[22:37:53] <iArivu> nope still the same
[22:38:11] <iArivu> actually its not just <b> tag
[22:38:14] <thinkxl> did you remove any <pre> or <code> tags ?
[22:38:16] <iArivu> it may be any tag
[22:38:21] <iArivu> yup
[22:38:35] <thinkxl> and is still showing you <b>Author</b> ?
[22:38:37] <thinkxl> weird
[22:38:43] <iArivu> yes :(
[22:39:15] <thinkxl> how are you removing the pre code tags?
[22:39:33] <iArivu> actually there is no pre code tag
[22:39:52] <thinkxl> then, what is it?
[22:40:04] <iArivu> just text with <b> Author </b>
[22:40:11] <iArivu> as in the snippet i sent you
[22:40:46] <iArivu> http://jsbin.com/mebuqato/4/edit
[22:53:06] <iArivu> thinkxl r u there?
[22:53:20] <thinkxl> iArivu: sorry I went to the kitchen
[22:53:29] <thinkxl> iArivu: I don't have idea man, sorry
[22:53:35] <iArivu> i forgot to mention the content is rendered before my code executes
[22:53:51] <thinkxl> iArivu: so you are rendering the content from the server?
[22:54:21] <thinkxl> sorry I don't get it
[22:55:18] <iArivu> my code is like this http://pastebin.com/ijAebwDk
[22:55:37] <iArivu> browser render the content on page load
[22:55:50] <iArivu> so i am trying to re-render it
[22:55:58] <iArivu> is it make sense?
[22:56:06] <thinkxl> what is the actual string you get from the server?
[22:56:20] <iArivu> sorry. i cant share
[22:56:37] <thinkxl> sorry I can't help then, maybe there is the problem
[22:57:27] <thinkxl> but if all your code is parsed ok and not only that line, is because something is wrong on the text you are getting
[22:57:27] <iArivu> thanks for your help :)
[22:57:32] <thinkxl> np!
[23:29:22] <K4T> hello, which exception should I throw when user made normal request instead of Ajax?
[23:29:42] <K4T> MethodNotAllowedException ?
[23:30:01] <sacho_>  exception?
[23:30:22] <sacho_> what do exceptions have to do with that?
[23:30:49] <K4T>         if($this->request->is('ajax')) {
[23:30:49] <K4T>         } else {
[23:30:49] <K4T>             //throw exception - which one?
[23:30:49] <K4T>         }
[23:31:10] <K4T> ok, if it is a wrong idea, could you tell me what should be done?
[23:31:47] <sacho_> you're in the wrong channel
