[07:57:45] <primitivMedia> https://pastebin.com/8FqQatf3 how do i properly escape my onError src for it to work within my replaceWith function??
[07:57:55] <primitivMedia> giving me a headache, whatever i try does notwork
[08:02:08] <Cork> don't use event attributes
[08:02:28] <Cork> bind event handlers
[08:02:54] <primitivMedia> what do you mean
[08:02:58] <primitivMedia> like pass a function instead?
[08:03:02] <primitivMedia> or do not use onError*
[08:03:03] <Cork> no
[08:03:13] <Cork> like use $('.circle').on('error')
[08:03:31] <Cork> or if you replace the function a lot use delegated event handlers
[08:04:05] <primitivMedia> inve never worked with image errors before
[08:04:11] <Cork> the reason you have the problem right now is cause you have multiple levels of escaled strings
[08:04:22] <Cork> its just events just like click
[08:04:23] <primitivMedia> i simply need a function or method to display a placeholder image instead of the broken links if there are any of the present page
[08:06:16] <primitivMedia> https://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/better-broken-image-handling/4
[08:06:19] <primitivMedia> something like this?
[08:07:06] <Cork> yup, except that will bind to img elements that exists when that code runs
[08:07:29] <Cork> so if you want to dynamically replace the img elements you want to delegate the handler
[08:10:46] <primitivMedia> right now it's not doing anything
[08:12:17] <primitivMedia> i have a 404 image not  found
[08:12:26] <primitivMedia> but it  wont replace it with the one defined in the function
[08:15:04] <primitivMedia>  $('img.circle').on("error", function() {
[08:15:20] <primitivMedia> does not change the img src for broken ones am i not understanding how this is supposed to work?
[08:16:21] <Cork> the event for error fires as soon as the browser tries to access the image
[08:16:44] <Cork> so if you have the image statically (not added throught js) it will fire before the listener is there
[08:16:52] <primitivMedia> i add the image through js...
[08:16:55] <primitivMedia> crap
[08:17:10] <primitivMedia> what other options do i have at this point?
[08:17:26] <Cork> try replaceWith($('<img>', { src: '404.png' }).on('error', handler));
[08:17:28] <primitivMedia> can i add a delay timer on the erro function?
[08:17:46] <Cork> not really
[08:18:03] <Cork> as it isn't the execution that is the problem, but not catching the event
[08:29:19] <primitivMedia> wait why is there a $ in front o nreplacwWith
[08:30:40] <primitivMedia> https://bpaste.net/show/7TYC
[08:30:45] <primitivMedia> this is my code
[08:31:24] <Cork> $() searches for the element matching the selector 'span.circle' and replaces that element with the parsed version in replaceWith
[08:31:44] <Cork> or rather is finds it and then hands the result to replaceWith that does the rest of the work
[08:32:37] <primitivMedia> but i have more than just img
[08:32:38] <primitivMedia> i have a span
[08:32:45] <primitivMedia> i dont think i can use what you sent
[08:32:52] <primitivMedia> that changes the whole scheme of my replaceWith
[08:32:58] <Cork> you can, you just have to nest if more
[08:33:13] <primitivMedia> ive never used that sort of handler sorry I'm not familiar with how to add it to my setup
[08:33:20] <primitivMedia> do i add it after the last '
[08:33:26] <primitivMedia> closing the replace with
[08:33:30] <primitivMedia> to add the saecond argument?
[08:33:34] <Cork> that code generates an img element, you will have to give that element to the parent elements you want and chaing that up
[08:33:51] <primitivMedia> idk what you mean by give that element to the p[arent element...
[08:35:29] <Cork> $('<span>', { html: $('<img>', {}) })
[08:35:44] <Cork> that generates an img element and then gives it as a child to a span element
[08:35:52] <primitivMedia> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18683503/jquery-on-image-error-not-working-on-dynamic-images/18683695
[08:35:56] <primitivMedia> this could possibly work?
[08:35:57] <primitivMedia> oh
[08:36:00] <primitivMedia> i get it
[08:36:01] <Cork> but as they generate elements, and not html strings
[08:36:12] <Cork> you can bind event handlers to them before they are added to the document
[08:36:16] <primitivMedia> html will change the html inside the span element
[08:36:24] <Cork> no
[08:36:26] <primitivMedia> rather than me changing the whole span and its children?
[08:36:32] <Cork> your inverting the relation
[08:36:38] <primitivMedia> im so confused
[08:36:39] <Cork> browsers work with dom elements, not html
[08:37:06] <Cork> if you give html to a browser it parses the tags and generate dom elements from it, that it then uses
[08:40:13] <primitivMedia> i have no idea what i need to do to achieve this\
[08:41:36] <primitivMedia> a timer made the error function work lol
[08:42:55] <primitivMedia> nvm that doesnt work either
[08:44:48] <primitivMedia> on change however works
[08:46:56] <primitivMedia> thanks for the help btw i appreciate it
[09:38:02] <royalty> good morning, so when i want to know if x y and z values of a form arent' filled out
[09:38:07] <royalty> what's the cleanest way to do that?
[09:38:35] <royalty> do i just say if ($('#fieldinput').val() !== '')
[09:38:52] <thykka> what are you planning to do with that information?
[09:39:18] <royalty> if it is filled out show a modal before submit, do not do that if not
[09:39:40] <thykka> so, form validation?
[09:39:45] <royalty> no
[09:40:13] <royalty> the modal is some other thing that searches for potential matches, to stop potential duplicate data
[09:40:27] <royalty> but it doesn't make sense to do that if the information isn't there
[09:41:07] <thykka> right
[09:41:36] <thykka> checking .val() !== '' is fine, as well as .val().length > 0
[09:41:44] <thykka> but in some contexts there could be more elegant ways
[09:42:07] <royalty> i see, is it easy to select from the name attribute, because that might be better for me
[09:42:21] <royalty> hmmm
[09:42:24] <thykka> $('[name="somename"]')
[09:42:31] <thykka> would select <input name="somename">
[09:42:33] <royalty> is it possible to do multiple names at once
[09:42:37] <royalty> and do an each on them
[09:42:41] <thykka> yes, of course
[09:43:29] <royalty> $('[name="this"][name="that"]');
[09:43:40] <thykka> put a comma in between
[09:43:50] <thykka> otherwise it tries to match *both* not *either*
[09:44:36] <thykka> you can also do a wildcard match, in case your names start with a common prefix
[09:44:49] <thykka> i.e. $('[name^="myInput-"]')
[09:45:06] <thykka> would match both <input name="myInput-foo"> and <input name="myInput-bar">
[09:45:24] <royalty> sweet, thank you
[09:45:32] <thykka> yw
[09:48:50] <thykka> one could also do something like: const shouldNotDisplayModal = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'].reduce((accumulator, name) => accumulator && $(`[name="${ name }"]`).val() === '', true)
[09:49:46] <thykka> this evaluates to true if none of the inputs are filled
[09:52:02] <nsh> i bet i could evaluate 100 truths
[09:53:31] <royalty> so you are putting together an array of names, and reducing them, what does accumulator do
[09:53:32] <royalty> lol
[09:53:36] <royalty> i should read up on reduce
[09:53:55] <shoky> no reason for .reduce() when there is .every()
[09:54:59] <thykka> royalty, reduce takes an array and performs an operation for each item, while returning a single value. The accumulator is what holds that value from each iteration to the next
[09:55:11] <royalty> i see
[09:55:22] <royalty> also looking at it maybe i should just use every?
[09:55:29] <thykka> it can also take an initial value, which in this case is the ", true)" -part
[09:55:35] <thykka> yes, every makes sense here
[09:58:36] <royalty> thanks guys
[13:09:39] <Howdy_McGee> The jQuery mobile is broken for me in every browser. It continually spins. I just need the tap events functionality. Alternatives?
[13:10:01] <Howdy_McGee> The jQuery mobile site*. Issue already reported on Github where the generation part just spins.
[15:15:01] <Jordy> Hi! can I get some assistance with jquery mobile? I'd like to sort this listview, but because of the extra content in the a elements its isn't sorting alphabetically for me.
[15:15:04] <Jordy> https://jsfiddle.net/r04n3djc/1/
[15:18:00] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't look like any of that code is even firing.
[15:23:08] <Jordy> It is what I found at the jquery demos site :x
[15:23:23] <robertmaxrees> i think the issue is with jsfiddle.
[15:24:19] <Jordy> But I have the same issue out of jsfiddle :p
[15:24:38] <robertmaxrees> add a console.log('foo') to the dop of that .on() binding - does it fire?
[15:26:14] <robertmaxrees> also: i think you're confused about what the autodivider does
[15:26:16] <Jordy> Nope
[15:26:43] <Jordy> Doesn't fire*
[15:26:48] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:27:07] <robertmaxrees> second off - your backend should really be outputting these in order for you.
[15:28:00] <Jordy> There is no backend really, its for a static jquery mobile page
[15:28:13] <robertmaxrees> then sort things correctly yourself once and call it a day.
[15:28:15] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:28:41] <Jordy> Right :p
[20:30:43] <mducharme> afternoon
[20:34:23] <mducharme> I'm having a really weird problem with datatables
[20:34:29] <mducharme> anybody familiar with it
[21:54:56] * pavonia is not familiar with any really weird datatables problems
[22:00:16] <mducharme> LOL
[22:06:36] <mducharme> I was asking if anybody was familiar with datatables, not weird datatables problems
[22:07:15] <mducharme> I've been fighting with it for hours
[22:46:50] <pavonia> mducharme: I'm not familiar with datatables, but it's usually best to just state the problem instead of waiting for people who think they might be able to help
[22:53:12] <mducharme> I'm starting to think the problem may not actually be on the datatables side
[22:53:34] <mducharme> otherwise I would state the problem
[23:25:56] <mducharme> yes, I've confirmed the problem is not on the datatables side
[23:33:17] <robertmaxrees> so what's the problem?
