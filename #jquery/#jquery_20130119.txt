[00:29:25] <superdmp> I have this little script, that hides/shows one field depending upon what a <select> has been changed to - what could I do to it so that it hides/shows according to the <select>'s value when the document is first loaded?
[00:30:48] <superdmp> oops, script: http://dpaste.org/bREGu/
[00:30:56] <superdmp> forgot that

[01:22:37] <pengo> gmail turns email addresses into little tag boxes like this: http://imgur.com/27Q7Sh5 .. do those little boxes have a name, and is there a library for manipulating them?
[01:26:37] <kerozene> pengo: sort of. see 'multi-value select boxes' @ http://ivaynberg.github.com/select2/
[01:27:56] <pengo> kerozene: having a look, thanks
[01:31:48] <pengo> kerozene: that's a pretty impressive library.. still scrolling through the examples to see if it does what i need :)
[01:32:23] <kerozene> you see the bit I mean tho right?
[01:36:27] <pengo> kerozene: yeah it's very close.. but i want the user to be able to insert plain text between the tags too.. will probably have to roll my own or extend something like this
[01:36:43] <kerozene> yeah
[01:36:58] <kerozene> there might be a fork also
[01:49:43] <seydar> is there a way to get a unique identifier for an element in the DOM?
[01:49:49] <seydar> like an id number i can search by?
[01:56:38] <fairuz_> seydar: You can give the element an id and search by that id
[01:57:55] <motaka2> hello whats the best way to simulate namespaces in jquery ?
[01:58:15] <tab1293> how can i do the equivalent of $('#token').val() with tokenDOM in this code http://pastebin.ca/2304505
[02:00:03] <seydar> fairuz_: well, i'd like to pick out an element, send the ID to another client, and then find that same element
[02:12:29] <fairuz_> motaka2: by encapsulating all your in code in an object (?)
[02:13:15] <motaka2> fairuz_ no thats not a good way - beacuase as soon as you want to extend that nemspace you will loose the previous one
[02:13:36] <motaka2> fairuz_: I think I should use jquery extend some how
[02:15:34] <fairuz_> don't quite get what you mean by losing the previous one
[02:18:06] <seydar> fairuz_: what can i do to look up a DOM element?
[02:18:58] <seydar> fairuz_: obviously the find() method. how can i serialize elements?
[02:19:59] <fairuz_> seydar: serialize() ?
[02:26:15] <popof_> can you use .css() to decrease font px by 1
[02:26:22] <popof_> instead of setting absolutely
[02:27:09] <popof_> += got it
[02:27:35] <seydar> fairuz_: but that method doesn't look like it can then rebuild an element out of it
[02:27:45] <seydar> i can't deserialize it into a dom element
[02:57:49] <tab1293> how can i parse html returned by the ajax command with jquery?
[03:09:30] <cuqa_> hey, im trying to submit data to a php script through $.post but having problems to actually submit an array ..

[04:00:39] <noregret> lol
[04:01:12] <noregret> any idea if I can somewhat use the activate event once only in the tabs widget ?
[04:01:41] <noregret> I mean i want the data loaded only once, not everytie i click on the tab
[04:03:06] <popof_> noregret: there are more than tabs widget
[04:03:10] <popof_> than one8
[04:03:51] <noregret> popof_: i'm talking about the jquery-ui tab widget ofc
[04:04:08] <popof_> shit I thought this was #html5, my b
[04:06:33] <fairway> hi all
[04:06:33] <trinadh|2> noregret: you sure it loads data multiple times..?
[04:06:40] <fairway> im looking for a good jquery slideshow plugin
[04:10:37] <noregret> trinadh|2: well yeah... activate event runs everytime a tab is clicked, and I request the data in that event
[04:10:55] <noregret> so the request will be sent each time it is clicked
[04:12:00] <trinadh|2> noregret: in the activate check if you have already got the data.. before requesting again..
[04:12:11] <trinadh|2> if condition may be...
[04:12:44] <noregret> shit, didn't think of that
[04:12:53] <trinadh|2> fairway: have you checked nivo slider..
[04:14:16] <noregret> how can I check if a #div is empty ?
[04:15:24] <noregret> fairway: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/ ? http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle2/ ?

[04:31:35] <fairuz_> if I use changePage('test.html'), it will load the first 'page' of test.html. Is it possible to load other pages in test.html? thanks
[04:39:17] <Piru_> Hi, I can't to get working this : $.get('sample.html',function(data){alert("test2");alert(data);});
[04:39:38] <Piru_> it doesn't alert test2 neither
[04:41:50] <noregret> Piru_: check the ajax request in the console
[04:43:59] <Piru_> noregret: How can I see that in opera?
[04:44:47] <Piru_> or any other
[04:45:40] <noregret> Piru_: not sure, I use firefox with the firebug addon
[04:45:56] <noregret> Piru_: check maybe there is developer tools hidden somewhere in opera
[04:46:37] <Piru_> i see the console, but it doesn't show that stuff
[04:46:46] <Piru_> I am gonna install firebug
[04:48:20] <iko1> where could i find a script who makes a menu drop down on a site when you scroll down a bit? like this: http://phpmaster.com/ - or what is the common name given to the function so i could try google different examples of it
[04:52:36] <Piru_> noregret: It just says som warnings about get does not always return a value
[04:53:04] <Piru_> anonymous function
[04:55:35] <shoky> Piru_: opera has built in devtools including a network tab
[04:55:44] <Vendethiel> mmh, just downloaded jquery ui themes and it seems that animated-overlay hasn't been copied to themes images/ folder
[04:56:28] <noregret> Piru_: is it Getting sample.html correctly ?
[04:57:26] <Piru_> noregret: nope
[04:57:35] <Piru_> shoky: I found it thanks
[04:58:35] <Piru_> It sends just two request
[04:59:06] <Piru_> for jquery and the that web
[05:00:34] <noregret> Piru_: what web ? and what is its response code
[05:00:35] <Piru_> anyways it doesn't even alert
[05:00:51] <Piru_> that page
[05:01:00] <Piru_> the one that i have the script
[05:01:13] <shoky> alerts dont matter
[05:01:20] <shoky> check the status of the ajax request
[05:01:26] <shoky> check the response..
[05:01:37] <Piru_> it doesn't send it
[05:01:47] <Piru_> i think
[05:01:56] <shoky> that may be..
[05:02:10] <noregret> Piru_: maybe sample.html path is incorrect
[05:02:24] <Piru_> i did a iframe and works
[05:02:26] <shoky> what were the warnings you said you got?
[05:02:39] <Piru_> TypeError: anonymous function does not always return a value
[05:02:43] <Piru_> in firebug
[05:02:48] <shoky> that's an error not a warning
[05:02:56] <shoky> er
[05:03:01] <shoky> i think ;S
[05:03:13] <Piru_> it's on the warning tab
[05:04:04] <shoky> weird warning, then
[05:04:39] <Piru_> I downloaded some code of a book that uses that function, and it should work
[05:05:15] <Piru_> but it doesn't work
[05:06:45] <shoky> Piru_:  put:  console.log("TEST");
[05:06:48] <shoky> before the $.get
[05:06:58] <shoky> and see if it even logs that..
[05:07:14] <shoky> and .. debug it
[05:07:17] <shoky> ?ftj
[05:07:18] <bot-t> Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[05:07:38] <Piru_> shoky: yes
[05:09:31] <shoky> also add an error handler-   $.get(...).fail(function(a,b,c){ console.log("ERROR",a,b,c) });
[05:11:20] <Piru_> shoky: ERROR, Object , error,  Unhandled DOMException: NETWORK_ERR
[05:13:48] <shoky> Piru_: and in chrome/ff ?
[05:13:58] <shoky> wait
[05:14:21] <shoky> are you running this on the local filesystem.. like  a file://   url?
[05:14:38] <Piru_> yes
[05:16:32] <Piru_> In Chrome says:Failed to load resource: Resource failed to load
[05:16:34] <noregret> lol damn
[05:16:40] <shoky> welp i'd assume that's the reason
[05:16:51] <noregret> Piru_: you need a webserver running
[05:17:23] <shoky> you can set browser preferences (at least in some) to allow it
[05:17:48] <Piru_> ohh ok, thanks
[05:48:37] <Aric> can you do selectors for alt tags?
[05:48:54] <Aric> $('alt-tag').addClass('blah')
[05:50:33] <shoky> you mean alt attribute?
[05:50:47] <shoky> $('[alt]')
[05:53:14] <Aric> thank you
[05:58:37] <Aric> $('[about]').addClass('active');	//didnt work
[06:00:49] <noregret> Aric: do you have an attrib called 'about' ?
[06:01:08] <shoky> $('[alt=about]')  ?
[06:18:54] <mads-> I'm just reading through some jquery code. I have no luck searching google for this: What does "$." mean? I see it as $.getJSON and $.addMembers in the code I'm reading
[06:19:22] <BinaryKitten> $ = jQuery
[06:19:29] <BinaryKitten> it's an alias
[06:20:16] <BinaryKitten> $.xxx means that xxx is a function attached to the jQuery prototype
[06:20:57] <BinaryKitten> *function/property
[06:21:24] <mads-> I see. Why would you attach a function to the jQuery prototype? What difference does that make?
[06:21:39] <BinaryKitten> just makes it easier to access
[06:21:54] <BinaryKitten> also in theory means there is less mess in the global namespace
[06:22:22] <mads-> Aah, makes sense. Thanks :)
[06:22:25] <BinaryKitten> np
[06:33:30] <Industrial> Is there a nicer way? $('#index-template')[0].innerHTML
[06:33:57] <Industrial> it's a <script id="index-template type="text/html">somehtml</script>
[06:34:08] <motaka2> Sorry i dont understand (function($))  in this code http://pastebin.com/NAyCjBGN
[06:36:32] <noregret> Industrial:  $('#index-template').html() ?
[06:37:05] <Vendethiel> motaka2: that's a function parameter
[06:37:32] <motaka2> Vendethiel: but the code starts with (
[06:37:37] <Industrial> noregret: yeah somehow I'm getting a cannot call method 'html' of undefined
[06:37:53] <Vendethiel> motaka2: (function () {})() is just var a=function(){}; a();
[06:37:54] <Industrial> nvm
[06:37:58] <Vendethiel> motaka2: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[06:38:03] <Vendethiel> you're just calling it as-is
[06:38:39] <motaka2> Vendethiel: :) thank you
[06:42:34] <fairuz_> if I use changePage('test.html'), it will load the first 'page' of test.html. Is it possible to load other pages in test.html?
[06:47:01] <Vendethiel> fairuz_: ?
[06:48:45] <fairuz_> This is jquery mobile. To make it clearer, my test.html has two page container. My objective now is to change the current page (index.html) to the second page container of test.html.
[06:58:40] <arex\\> shouldn't $(element) yield a jquery wrapped element, or have that changed?
[06:59:47] <rindolf> arex\\: it should I think.
[07:19:08] <Krambiorix> hi guys, i'm building a webapplication with Jquery and PHP .  With Jquery I want to call my php classes. I know about ajax calls but how could i make this calling process the most optimal?
[07:19:27] <Teduardo> is there an easy way to make the action of form.id open in a .dialog() when you click on it's button?
[07:21:20] <Vendethiel> Teduardo: the action of form.id ?
[07:22:06] <Krambiorix> i mean: should i make one "ajaxhandler" in PHP that receives all ajaxcalls and calls my classes?
[07:22:18] <Krambiorix> or are there other principles at hand
[07:22:33] <Teduardo> Vendethiel: you know like <form action="somethingsomething.php"><button ....>
[07:22:49] <Vendethiel> $('button').click(function () { $('blah').dialog(); return false }); ?
[07:23:03] <Vendethiel> Krambiorix: it depends on what you want & what you need
[07:23:20] <Vendethiel> there used to be xajax but that's slow and surely has issues
[07:24:08] <Teduardo> Vendethiel: and if blah is a url or a filename it will automatically load it?
[07:24:19] <Vendethiel> blah is a jquery selector
[07:24:44] <Vendethiel> $('button').click(function () { $('#mydiv').load('url').dialog(); return false }); ?
[07:24:48] <Krambiorix> Vendethiel, well i have a lot of classes so i will have a lot of ajax calls
[07:25:19] <Krambiorix> Vendethiel, so i was thinking to make 1 php script that handles all ajax calls
[07:26:10] <Krambiorix> Vendethiel, or is that not "the way" to do it?
[07:26:40] <Vendethiel> Krambiorix: seems a bit dirty to me
[07:26:58] <Krambiorix> Vendethiel, what are the alternatives?
[07:27:09] <Vendethiel> files handling things
[07:27:17] <Vendethiel> well I usually have one per ajax-callable service
[07:28:02] <Krambiorix> Vendethiel, per call you have a file?
[07:28:38] <Vendethiel> per service. for account, I may have multiple ajax things (check username, blah) but only one file to handle registration
[07:30:25] <Krambiorix> Vendethiel, ow ok
[07:31:49] <Vendethiel> you do what you think is best
[07:32:01] <Krambiorix> Vendethiel, yes
[08:03:42] <Teduardo> Vendethiel: Okay so I got it "working" but it seems to be loading the external content into the <div> instead of into a modal "infront" of the page
[08:04:07] <Vendethiel> div is supposed to be modal
[08:04:14] <Vendethiel> hence the .dialog()
[08:07:27] <Teduardo> wow thats freakin bizarre =)
[08:08:10] <Teduardo> i wonder if its because the external resource has it's own scripts, etc
[08:08:49] <Vendethiel> no
[08:28:02] <Teduardo> anyone use position: much in jquery ui? by default it seems like it starts at the center how do you actually center the whole object?
[08:28:08] <aro> is there a way to get the time processed for an ajax request
[08:30:27] <Vendethiel> aro: your browser ?
[08:31:41] <sunbeam> I have an element and i need it to have a background color of just the first 2 pixels of the div
[08:31:52] <sunbeam> is there some way i can accomplish this?
[08:32:08] <sunbeam> backhround width should be 100% height just 2px
[08:37:10] <thisboy> http://jsfiddle.net/TTmxg/2/ -- trying to change color on hoverIntent -- but where's the delay on the out function though?
[08:40:35] <Teduardo> is there an element for the current viewable part of a window instead of the entire window?
[08:41:26] <shoky> Teduardo: the window is the current viewable part.. no?
[08:42:12] <Teduardo> No, it appears to be centering .dialog based on the entire size of the window
[08:42:21] <Teduardo> if I crank my resolution all the way up the box is centered
[08:42:28] <Teduardo> if not it's not
[08:43:50] <shoky> not sure what you mean
[08:44:36] <Teduardo> the page that the .dialog is opening infront of is longer than my resolution, it appears to be centering the .dialog based on the size of the entire page rather than based on the amount of the page I can see at any given time
[08:44:52] <xec_> how is it centered?
[08:45:12] <b0x> margin?
[08:45:42] <b0x> you setting the size with %? and is it parented by html/body?
[08:45:49] <Teduardo> using the position: center, center, window
[08:47:11] <shoky> a string?
[08:47:38] <xec_> Teduardo: are you talking about the position option of the jquery dialog?
[08:48:17] <xec_> Teduardo: have you tried just position: 'center' ?
[08:48:34] <shoky> center is default, anyways
[08:48:41] <Teduardo> xec_: yes, and that's the default too; it seems to not be centered vertically
[08:49:09] <Teduardo> anyway its probably not important enough right now to worry about
[09:07:04] <aro> is there a way to get the time processed for an ajax request
[09:07:18] <aro> i want to display it in the page for the user
[09:10:06] <systemfault_> aro: There's no precise way… I guess you could get the current date before… and after (in the callback) and substract the getTime() value of both to get the number of millisecond..
[09:10:22] <systemfault_> Do you think it will take a minute of what?
[09:10:40] <aro> no, its an api console
[09:19:22] <sunbeam> hi, i'd i've got a nav ul li where each li has a certain width
[09:19:37] <sunbeam> if all li together exceed the width of the nav, i want everythying that doesn't fit cut off
[09:19:44] <sunbeam> any idea how I can best do this with jquery
[09:22:57] <burnt> hi there, .animate wont work for me no matter what I do
[09:27:16] <mads-> burnt, you have some code to show us or a little better explanation? :P
[09:39:11] <ParanoidGal> http://www.billiemyers.blogsultant.co.uk/watch/ -Something is causing the lightbox plugin to be ignored here. Any ideas on how to fixe the conflict?
[09:47:56] <mads-> ParanoidGal, which browser are you using?
[09:55:45] <mads-> ParanoidGal, no matter. take a look at all of those script files which aren't being loaded at all.
[09:57:08] <burnt> hi came somone help me with a tr, td hover issue
[09:57:09] <burnt> http://pastebin.com/gLyUNGPD
[09:57:10] <burnt> tia
[09:58:26] <Vendethiel> burnt: $(this).parent().find('td').not(this).animate ...
[09:59:47] <Vendethiel> or find tr
[10:01:19] <burnt> ah thanks
[10:02:56] <sunbeam> hi, i would like to hide everything that falls out of the height set for an element
[10:03:04] <sunbeam> and not hide using overflow: hidden but display: none
[10:03:07] <sunbeam> any idea how I can do this?
[10:09:42] <burnt> Vendethiel still dosnt work, I now have this http://pastebin.com/UFNAyV29
[10:10:05] <Vendethiel> you want to fade others and show the hovered ?
[10:10:10] <burnt> i just want to animate a td when i hover over it, so the background goes a diff color
[10:10:24] <burnt> nah just fade and unfade on hover and hover-off
[10:10:29] <Vendethiel> aah
[10:10:34] <Vendethiel> my bad
[10:10:39] <burnt> sorry im new to jquery
[10:10:42] <Vendethiel> go back to your original code
[10:10:43] <burnt> not your bad at all
[10:10:51] <Vendethiel> I think you need jquery ui to animate colors, let me check
[10:10:52] <burnt> it dosnt work though
[10:12:30] <burnt> omg all it was was ui, but the whole row highlights
[10:12:36] * burnt has a lot to learn
[10:13:18] <sacrilicious> good morning
[10:13:22] <sacrilicious> $(this).removeClass('.lick_button_cow') is this valid ?
[10:13:24] <Vendethiel> what's supposed to hl ?
[10:13:32] <Vendethiel> sacrilicious: without the leading dot
[10:13:43] <sacrilicious> $(this).removeClass('lick_button_cow') is this valid ???
[10:13:49] <Vendethiel> yes
[10:13:54] <burnt> just the td
[10:13:56] <sacrilicious> thanks :)
[10:13:59] <burnt> so one td highlights
[10:14:11] <burnt> can probably do it on the td now as it was a ui issue
[10:14:32] <Vendethiel> burnt: why not $('td').hover then ?

[11:00:40] <iamcurio> is there a way to fade in a div once after a certain amount of scroll?
[11:02:41] <osirisx11>  iamcurio: i would use waypoints with fadeIn()
[11:03:21] <b1lly> iamcurio: you need to bind an event listener to the "scroll" event
[11:03:35] <b1lly> and then check the scroll position in it
[11:03:47] <b1lly> and then call the function to fadeIn
[11:04:12] <iamcurio> b1lly: are they any examples you can point me to?
[11:06:05] <ParanoidGal> Can anyone see why http://www.billiemyers.blogsultant.co.uk/watch videos aren't appearing in a lightbox when clicked on? Thanks in advance
[11:06:32] <iaj> Hi there.. is there any way to unset the required attribute for all input fields below a certain class? Or rather, toggle them?
[11:07:50] <b1lly> http://jsfiddle.net/hjkgF/
[11:10:03] <b-lew> Is there a way to show/hide a div like here…. http://pastie.org/5728434 but do it with a toggle animation?
[11:10:29] <b-lew> so it looks like its coming out from the side horizontally. not vertically?
[11:11:16] <b-lew> or diagonal
[11:12:33] <rindolf> Hi all.
[11:13:00] <b-lew> Hi
[11:13:10] <osirisx11> show("slideIn") animation?
[11:13:14] <osirisx11> something like that
[11:13:36] <osirisx11> you  can always use animate() with top/left
[11:14:04] <b-lew>  $(".show_hide").show("slideIn"); didn't work
[11:14:07] <b-lew> already tried that
[11:14:16] <b-lew> animate(). let me try that
[11:15:39] <Vendethiel> b-lew: $(".show_hide").slideIn() ?
[11:15:50] <osirisx11> check jqueryUI also b-lew
[11:16:22] <Vendethiel> I think ui.effect has something
[11:18:52] <b-lew> is there a way to replace .text with an image?
[11:19:20] <AlexC_> G'morning
[11:19:47] <AlexC_> If I want to update the "src" attribute value of an existing "img" element, so the browser will download and display the new image, is it correct to use .prop() instead of .attr()?
[11:20:43] <b1lly> b-lew: use animate
[11:20:54] <b-lew> animate
[11:21:03] <b-lew> could I use this?
[11:21:04] <b-lew> http://code.google.com/p/slideinout/downloads/detail?name=jquery.slideinout-0.1.tar.gz&can=2&q=
[11:21:17] <b1lly> you can juse use animate
[11:25:10] <b-lew> trying to find a tutorial on how to do that
[11:26:41] <b-lew> something like this?
[11:27:59] <ParanoidGal> osirisx11: Do you have a second to look at a thickbox issue I'm having?
[11:28:45] <osirisx11> i really don't, sorry ParanoidGal

[11:39:01] <Absolute0> I have a div with small divs in it. I also have another large div covering the first container div. How can I bypass the second large div and send mouse events to the small divs in the first large div?
[11:40:06] <Absolute0> I tried $(second_div).click(function (e) { $(first_div).trigger(e); }); but that seems to cause maximum stack error.
[11:41:54] <sunbeam> hi, i would like to hide everything that falls out of the height set for an element
[11:41:57] <sunbeam> and not hide using overflow: hidden but display: none
[11:41:59] <sunbeam> any idea how I can do this?
[11:42:35] <Absolute0> sunbeam: get all the elements and check each one if it exceeds your div; if so, hide itt.
[11:42:59] <osirisx11> Absolute0: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/passing-click-events-through-a-blocking-element
[11:43:35] <osirisx11> Absolute0: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1401658/html-overlay-which-allows-clicks-to-fall-through-to-elements-behind-it
[11:43:40] <osirisx11> good luck
[11:43:46] <Absolute0> haha
[11:43:59] <Absolute0> oh pointer-events: none
[11:44:12] <sunbeam> Absolute0: how can i see whether the position is different?
[11:44:18] <sunbeam> because that is what i am looking for
[11:44:27] <sunbeam> say the others all have top: 0
[11:44:35] <sunbeam> the items flowing outside have top: 40px
[11:45:24] <Absolute0> sunbeam: $('.your_elements').each(function () { if ($(this).position().top <40) $(this).hide() });
[11:45:35] <Absolute0> or change the logic in the if to match your requirements
[11:45:57] <Absolute0> jquery provides .position() .offset() .width() and .height() I am sure that's enough for your case.
[11:46:40] <sunbeam> Absolute0: yes
[11:46:42] <sunbeam> sec
[11:47:00] <sunbeam> Absolute0: but they don't have position: absolute
[11:47:02] <sunbeam> is that a problem?
[11:47:18] <Absolute0> they do, you're just not setting it
[11:47:52] <Absolute0> osirisx11: http://e-infotainment.com/projects/interface-query/demos/behaviours/forward-mouse-events/
[11:51:50] <sunbeam> Absolute0: thanks
[11:52:17] <sunbeam> so then i just need to check, for each element if they have a certain offset
[11:52:41] <Absolute0> offset is the position with respect to the window
[11:52:48] <Absolute0> positon is with respect to the parent div
[11:52:56] <Absolute0> so use whichever makes more sense
[11:56:25] <sunbeam> hmm weird for some strange reason some element that's on the smae line as the othere elements (and has the same ul li content) has top more thna 0
[11:57:57] <Absolute0> sunbeam: show us some code on jsfiddle.net
[12:05:19] <sunbeam> sec
[12:05:21] <hye> Hi I am using this code:  http://pastebin.com/LWJkEFHa  to show a loading image when an ajaxstarts or stops.  how can I show only the loading image to certain ajax events and not all?  is there an easy way to group ajax events and target the groups with the loader?  so different groups can use different loaders on the same page?
[12:05:45] <sunbeam> Absolute0: i can try its a little complex
[12:13:32] <b-lew> Could I score some help on this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14418165/animate-show-hide-div-from-left-to-right
[12:14:52] <lost_and_unfound> greetings all, I have a floorplan jpg, and would like to realtime highligh/draw eachtime there is movement in a specific room. Movement is determined and saved in a DB, and a json script checks every second the DB. what would be the best way to animate this? e.g. 1.) redraw image and refresh/reload 2.) use hotspots and chage color on image 3.) other options ? Thanks
[12:31:56] <rindolf> lost_and_unfound: maybe try YUI or something.
[12:32:54] <lost_and_unfound> thanks rindolf, will have a look
[12:33:05] <rindolf> lost_and_unfound: you're welcome.
[12:33:10] <rindolf> lost_and_unfound: Dojo may also be suitable.
[12:33:40] <lost_and_unfound> rindolf: need to see if it is possible, running of a Raspberry Pi and Tablet
[12:33:51] <rindolf> lost_and_unfound: ah.
[12:33:53] <lost_and_unfound> think Dojo will be too much to handle
[12:34:21] <rindolf> lost_and_unfound: OK.
[12:34:25] <rodneyrehm> hey there!
[12:34:31] <rindolf> rodneyrehm: hi.
[12:34:56] <rodneyrehm> Am I too impatient or is a push to jquery plugins repo not supposed to be immediate?
[12:35:04] <rindolf> lost_and_unfound: there's also ExtJS, but it's GPLv3ed.
[12:35:37] <lost_and_unfound> rindolf: thanks, totally unfamiliar with ExtJS
[12:35:54] <rindolf> lost_and_unfound: OK.
[12:36:30] <rindolf> lost_and_unfound: ExtJS pulled an ugly stunt because the early versions were under a variation of the LGPL licence that prevented forking.
[12:36:39] <rindolf> lost_and_unfound: and then they converted to the GPLv3.
[12:36:53] <rindolf> lost_and_unfound: unmodified though.
[12:37:37] <rodneyrehm> seems I'm not impatient but dumb… :D
[12:41:54] <div3984> this is a big jquery slideshow.  http://www.buildinternet.com/project/supersized/  is there something like this but better anyone could recommend
[13:03:15] <GoSox> I've only done ajax-ey form submissions with the jquery form plugin, and now i'm trying to do them without the plugin.
[13:04:48] <GoSox> i'm looking for some sample code, for a basic "verify input, then abort or submit form inline" type of thing
[13:05:31] <defaultro> hey guys, need some help regarding livequery. THere is a field Validation function that is inside the livequery. I already found another solution for field validation but I have not implemented it yet. Is there a way to prevent that function from being executed?
[13:10:17] <sunbeam> hi, i would like to hide everything that falls out of the height set for an element
[13:10:20] <sunbeam> and not hide using overflow: hidden but display: none
[13:10:23] <sunbeam> any idea how I can do this?
[13:11:02] <iaj> Is it possible to change the options for a select field via jQuery?
[13:12:37] <shoky> iaj: sure
[13:13:30] <iaj> shoky: do you have a link handy or somehting?  I have 3 different options, or 2 based on a prior select box... should either be the 3 or the 2 options
[13:27:16] <GoSox> so the proper way to do ajax form submission is to not submit the form at all, and instead just do a $.post (or $.get) http request through jquery instead
[13:29:22] <tw2113> i think that would be the form submission
[13:47:54] <raj> iaj, jquery can do what it wants
[13:47:57] <DeltaHeavy> Hey, if I wanted to find the parent element of another element, but it wasn't a direct descendant (15 or so additional parents), is there a way to get that one parent I'm looking for (a form in this case) without running the parent method 15 or so times? I'm trying to submit a form when a specific element is clicked.
[13:48:18] <raj> DeltaHeavy, .closest()
[13:48:21] <plustour> hey, so simple ajax and i can not make it work :/
[13:48:23] <raj> ?closest
[13:48:23] <plustour> http://jsfiddle.net/vdbeG/
[13:48:24] <bot-t> .closest(selector): Get the first element that matches the selector, beginning at the current element and progressing up through the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/closest/

[13:48:38] <plustour> any ideas? i just need latest 2-3 tweets
[13:49:22] <idr0p> whois idr0p
[13:50:01] <plustour> anybody who can help with this?
[13:51:30] <plustour> huh... anyone?
[13:52:14] <raj> how do I get the httpexception code of an ajax request?
[13:53:09] <plustour> please, you're my last hope (:
[13:53:32] <raj> huh?
[13:54:06] <plustour> http://jsfiddle.net/9uwAT/
[13:54:15] <raj> plustour, it won't work cuz the origin url is not the same as the destination or something
[13:54:24] <systemfault> raj: third parameter of .done or first of .fail    with its .status variable
[13:54:49] <aro> is there a way to catch 401 errors with $.ajax()
[13:55:01] <plustour> raj, sorry but didnt get it... what do you mean the origin url
[13:55:21] <plustour> raj, if you use this url in the browser... you'll get the tweets
[13:55:37] <systemfault> .fail(function(jqXhr) { alert(jqXhr.status); }); iirc
[13:55:47] <m4ggus> plustour: ajax/get/post methods only works for request on the same server, you should use getJson
[13:56:03] <aro> so dont use the error: parameter?
[13:56:29] <aro> (it didnt work anyways!)
[13:56:35] <systemfault> aro: That's the old way...
[13:56:54] <systemfault> Using the promise interface is now the "recommended way"
[13:57:34] <systemfault> $.ajax(config).done(function(data) { handle data here }).fail(function(  handle failure here ){});
[13:57:51] <aro> is that part of 1.9? or will it work in 1.7.x
[13:58:13] <raj> systemfault, I can't get it within the 'success' function?
[13:58:50] <systemfault> raj: Probably… but I don't remember the parameters… as I never use the old way anymore.
[13:59:15] <systemfault> raj: With the promise interface, it's .status of the third arg
[13:59:50] <systemfault> .done(function(data, message, jqHxr) { alert(jqXhr.status); });
[13:59:54] <systemfault> IIRC.
[14:03:21] <aro> systemfault: .fail(function(jqXhr) { alert(jqXhr.status); }); didnt work
[14:10:59] <systemfault> aro: http://jsfiddle.net/KrJ6v/
[14:12:46] <aro> ok.. back to my other question, does this work in 1.7.x
[14:27:03] <raj> systemfault, success is the old way?
[14:27:06] <raj> why?
[14:28:01] <systemfault> Because it doesn't use the more flexible promise interface
[14:28:14] <systemfault> Promise are really powerful
[14:28:20] <raj> why's that?
[14:28:24] <raj> ...as in, why
[14:28:28] <raj> 's it powerful?
[14:28:52] <systemfault> Hmm.. how to explain it simply..
[14:29:15] <systemfault> Let's say you want to do X ajax transactions in parallel and have a callback called once they're all done
[14:29:39] <systemfault> With the "old way", it's painful and ugly...
[14:30:18] <shoky> raj COZ WE SAID SO
[14:30:50] <systemfault> With promises, you would use $.when(transaction1, transaction2, …… transactionX).done(function(…..) { and you would get all the responses as arguments for the done});
[14:31:21] <systemfault> Also… $.animate works with promises
[14:31:48] <raj> what about $.then?
[14:31:59] <raj> or .then() or whatever
[14:32:23] <systemfault> .then is when you need a callback for both success and failures IIRC..
[14:32:53] <systemfault> And I'm not totally sure but I think you can use it as a way to chain promises since 1.8
[14:33:17] <systemfault> The same way you could do it with .pipe before
[14:33:27] <shoky> also with promises you can add as many done/fail callbacks as you want
[14:33:38] <shoky> whenever you want
[14:38:39] <btipling> QUnit is so awesome
[14:39:24] <btipling> QUnit + grunt
[14:41:54] <raj> so I should stop using 'success', essentially
[14:42:03] <raj> and just do $.ajax().done()
[14:42:51] <systemfault> raj:
[14:42:53] <systemfault> Yes
[14:43:17] <systemfault> raj: An example… http://jsfiddle.net/AJNqv/1/
[14:43:39] <raj> i don't use success(), btw
[14:43:56] <raj> I use the success key in the $.ajax({}) object
[14:44:11] <systemfault> I understood that.
[14:44:51] <raj> there're too many new things in there
[14:44:59] <raj> I do'nt know when, then, or promise
[14:45:02] <systemfault> If you use the promise interface.. use .done/.fail/.always/and perhaps .progress and not .complete/.success/.error
[14:45:16] <systemfault> The last three are deprecated.

[16:51:29] <mrgt> Anyone?
[16:54:13] <b1lly> mrgt: that looks fine
[16:55:07] <b1lly> is there a reason your using an array to store an "index" though
[16:58:15] <mrgt> billy: was just experimenting. What I really want to achieve is a list of some sort and then post it when the user clicks the create button. Rather than posting each individually.
[16:58:35] <b1lly> I see
[16:59:32] <mrgt> billy: I'm kind of new to this. If I'm nuts and you think there's a much better way of doing it then I'm all ears.
[17:00:15] <b1lly> I'm not sure what the overall goal is
[17:00:22] <b1lly> your storing a list of question #'s ?
[17:00:42] <b1lly> if your storing any kind've list, arrays are fine
[17:01:44] <b1lly> the comment said "Increment the question no. after clicking", so I thought it was for a different purpose
[17:02:55] <mrgt> yeah.  I'm storing a list of questions. So.. when the user hits the 'create' button it will insert the questions  server side. The increment feature was so the button text changed.

[20:57:03] <Foxhoundz> has anyone used justGauge plugin?
[20:57:23] <happyface> mouseenter is just mouseover without propagation and hover is just mouseover I think
[20:58:01] <happyface> I'll just check mouse position or something
[20:59:58] <blar1> grunt is throwing a number of warnings at me, preventing the build of jquery unless i use "--force"... can anyone offer some guidance?
[21:00:20] <blar1> i'm recompiling nodejs at the moment, so i've got some downtime before i'll be retrying the jquery build
[21:02:46] <minond> happyface: i don't see how that wouldn't work, there may be something else going on
[21:03:33] <happyface> minond, well it won't trigger a mouseover event if your mouse is over the element before the event is binded
[21:03:47] <happyface> its fine though, theres ways around it
[21:11:38] <Foxhoundz> Has anyone used justGage plugin
[21:20:34] <blar1> i'm trying to build jquery, but grunt is halting with a "Cannot read property 'dest' of undefined" error when running the (selector) task.  can anyone offer some guidance?
[21:25:57] <blar1> n/m; looks like updating node and recompiling has fixed the problem
[21:38:31] <popof_> howdy..for whatever reason, the img within a div isnt responding to click events, while the padding around it is. the parent div has a click handler added to it
[21:38:33] <popof_> any ideas?
[21:38:34] <popof_> thanks!
[21:39:40] <tw2113> my guess is that the div is getting the click event and not the image
[21:42:20] <minond> did you do something funky with the positioning of the img element?
[21:42:45] <burnt> how can I say, $link = find('a').ist_url if you get what I mean
[21:43:08] <burnt> so when somone clicks on a td or a div, I get the url for the next <a href...> link
[21:43:42] <popof_> tw2113: haha well, thats the intentinallly actually. but I deleted the image and still only parts are working so thats not it after all
[21:43:44] <popof_> hrmmmm
[21:43:47] <popof_> cheers.
[21:43:58] <minond> $("td").click(function() { $(this).find("a").each(function() { window.open(this.href); }); });
[21:44:11] <burnt> minond I love you! :)
[21:44:24] <minond> burnt: np ;)
[21:58:57] <hugo_moss> hello, i have a website that uses jquery, and on the desktop everything works fine.  but for some reason, at random times, the website on the ipad3 works fine, but then stops firing jquery events. the jquery slider stops sliding, fancybox stops animating images, and fade transitions dont work anymore. it happens at random times. what would cause this to happen?
[22:00:16] <versatiletech> hugo_moss: do it stop only when you're touch scrolling?
[22:04:58] <hugo_moss> im using jcarousel
[22:05:08] <hugo_moss> and i have jquery event handlers attached to anchor tags
[22:05:31] <hugo_moss> when i click on random buttons that have jquery events
[22:05:34] <hugo_moss> the events stop responding
[22:05:37] <hugo_moss> the page doesnt freeze
[22:05:45] <hugo_moss> ajax calls still work
[22:06:05] <hugo_moss> but touch events stop happening
[22:15:49] <versatiletech> hmm not sure what's going on, have you tried debugging mobile safari?
[22:15:55] <versatiletech> hugo_moss: ^
[22:16:04] <hugo_moss> i cant
[22:16:08] <hugo_moss> i dont have a mac os x
[22:17:19] <tw2113> wouldn't mobile safari be part of ios?
[22:17:21] <versatiletech> I know you can download Safari on windows, don't know if it has a develop toolbar though
[22:18:23] <versatiletech> tw2113: you can debug mobile safari remotely with Safari on a mac
[22:18:26] <hugo_moss> they stopped support for safari on windows
[22:18:35] <versatiletech> ah
[22:18:36] <hugo_moss> has a ton of security issues
[22:18:43] <versatiletech> not surprising
[22:19:06] <tw2113> windows fault or safari's?

[22:33:53] <tfittsy> I'm tyring to make a filter that uses the jquery ui range slider.  The problem I'm having is I have like 7200 records I'm trying to filter where 7160 are between 0 and 100 but there are like 40 between 100 and 700.  Anyone have a recommendation for how I can best make it so only the last percent or two covers the huge range between 100 and 700?
[22:36:47] <popof_> tfittsy: brother
[22:36:58] <popof_> tfittsy: you need more math in your life
[22:37:12] <hugo_moss> versatiletech: thanks, they have a simulator
[22:37:31] <versatiletech> simulator?
[22:37:46] <popof_> tfittsy: ill take a look at the tool but this is a common and easily fixable stat problem
[22:39:53] <popof_> tfittsy: okay
[22:39:58] <popof_> tfittsy: give me your code please as it is now
[22:39:59] <popof_> tfittsy: ill fix
[22:41:21] <popof_> tfittsy: I dont have all day friend
[22:41:46] <tfittsy> which part do you want? the numbers or the jquery?
[22:42:04] <popof_> yes
[22:43:30] <tfittsy> I think I got it figured out.  I'm just gonna take everything higher than 100, subtract 100 from it, divide by 50 and add 100 back.  Then I'll do the same on the other end.
[22:43:34] <tfittsy> or the opposite.
[22:44:00] <tfittsy> that way the difference between 100 and 700 is the same as 86 and 100
[22:44:05] <tfittsy> or 88 actually
[22:45:00] <popof_> spanks for wasting my time then eh. theres also a values[] array you can use to specify instead of using fixed steps. also, look up what a logarithmic scale is
[22:45:16] <hugo_moss> yea its like a program simulator, that simulates an ipad device which you can debug in your browser
[22:45:23] <hugo_moss> i should try it again
[22:48:01] <tfittsy> I thought about doing it logarithmically but thought that it might progress too quickly but I think I might look at it again.
[22:50:05] <popof_> tfittsy: log base 10 wouldnt make sense for a 98% linear values then a few misnomers
[22:50:23] <popof_> tfittsy: either way I think using explicate values[] makes most sense rather than doing the math behind it
[22:51:34] <tfittsy> but I need more math in my life!
[22:51:56] <tw2113> 1+1=11
[22:52:57] <tfittsy> 1+1+1=11
[22:53:24] <tfittsy> 1+1=10
[23:04:06] <kurol> d3 has a function that will work
[23:04:42] <tw2113> mmm d3.js
[23:05:57] <kurol> if you need to take an nonlinear input range and make it something linear more suitable for jqueryui
[23:28:01] * tw2113 fires an air horn
[23:40:06] <oelewapperke> Hi
[23:40:27] <oelewapperke> I would like to use the jquery_ui autocomplete widget, and to start it displaying options from code
[23:41:19] <oelewapperke> (basically I want to autoselect category/item, but can't send the full category/item list, so instead I send the categories, and as soon as a category is selected, I'd like to get the item list, and show that
[23:42:25] <oelewapperke> I'm trying to do this by catching the select event, and calling setTimeout(50, function() { e.autocomplete("search", ""); });
[23:42:32] <oelewapperke> but that doesn't seem to have any effect at all
[23:42:38] <oelewapperke> anyone know what I'm doing wrong ?
[23:44:31] <oelewapperke> when I call that "search" function it does not actually trigger the "source" function
[23:49:25] <popof_> how can I use .prev() to see if it has a previous sibling?
[23:49:28] <popof_> like in an if()
[23:50:18] <popof_> if(!thing.prev().isEmptyObject())
[23:50:21] <popof_> does that work
[23:52:59] <tw2113> maybe check their length popof_
[23:56:05] <Shazer[2]> hey guys whats the best solution for sliding elements
[23:57:02] <popof_> Shazer[2]: jquery with easing?
[23:57:04] <popof_> is my goto
[23:57:16] <Shazer[2]> I want like a slideshow effect..
[23:57:17] <popof_> Shazer[2]: theres a .animate() function
[23:57:27] <Shazer[2]> but there will be 7 elements
[23:57:29] <Shazer[2]> to move between
[23:57:53] <popof_> Shazer[2]: oh jesus not 7
[23:57:57] <popof_> Shazer[2]: 8 is okay, 6 is fine
[23:58:10] <Shazer[2]> hahaha
[23:58:14] <Shazer[2]> I want one for each day of the week..
