[00:01:54] <nawi> noticed a difference between my desktop browser and Android's webview, .submit doesn't trigger for long taps (e.g. taphold), but it does for a quick tap. on a browser both work
[00:02:29] <nawi> I can fix it on jsfiddle by binding taphold manually, but of course it doesn't seem to work for my full app :)
[00:02:56] <nawi> http://jsfiddle.net/W4zB4/
[00:03:49] <nawi> the same is true for iOS, but at least iOS registers slightly longer taps than Android
[00:11:55] <Kasimir> nawi: Theres a different event for the longer tap called 'longTap'
[00:13:45] <nawi> Kasimir: do you mean taphold?
[00:15:22] <Kasimir> nawi: Or well actually, depends what framework you use
[00:15:52] <Kasimir> nawi: If you doing something from scrath then its just touchstart and touchend and touchmove events
[00:22:20] <avinashrbhat> where can i get help on jqm? here, or any other channel is there?
[00:24:12] <Kasimir> nawi: sorry abit snoozy still, as we are in jquery chan it indeed is taphold
[00:24:34] <Kasimir> Thought I was in the javascript chan :P
[00:27:18] <nawi> can't figure out why I can't change .submit to .on('tap'
[00:27:30] <nawi> that's the fix that works on jsfiddle
[00:43:27] <MrS1lentcz> hello, how can i determine if jquery object is iterable? i can have $('table') or $('table tr') selectors in my custom jquery extension, but i dont know, how  can i detect, what is is kind of object - "prop()"  returns udnefined in second selector...
[00:43:55] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: jquery objects is always itterable
[00:44:11] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: so ever object has " first"  method?
[00:44:37] <Cork> MrFox: $() returns an array like object, with the number of matched elements
[00:44:56] <Cork> .first() will generate a new array like objects with a max of 1 element
[00:45:38] <Cork> functions that return a value always only work on the first element in the set
[00:45:51] <Cork> like .val for example
[00:47:11] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: i am so sorry, i was solving custom throwed exception as global jquery fail :D
[00:48:57] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: i mean, but prop method returns undefined if object is array of many objects
[00:49:07] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: no
[00:49:11] <Cork> ?.prop
[00:49:11] <bot-t> .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[00:49:21] <Cork> "property for the first element in the set of matched elements."
[00:50:15] <Cork> $('*').prop('id') is the same as $('*').first().prop('id')
[00:51:20] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: ok, thank you very much :)
[01:11:59] <titii> maybe this is with css solution but show, hide is with jquery, but: How the bug is fixing in MSIE, when u have a dropdown menu, and moving over submenu and MSIE move out from the block straight out. And the hide away sub menu.
[01:16:01] <fRAiLtY-> Imagine 5 text inputs. Is it possible to do an alert when you switch from each one, i.e. either by tab or clicking?
[01:16:35] <Cork> $(parent).on('focus', 'input', function() {})
[01:16:36] <titii> fRAiLtY-: focus
[01:20:26] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  http://jsfiddle.net/hmSeB/1/ ? doesn't work for me, what have I done wrong
[01:21:04] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/hmSeB/2/
[01:21:54] <fRAiLtY-> Ah wait, I see
[01:22:09] <fRAiLtY-> Got there before me
[01:22:30] <fRAiLtY-> Ok, but it just spools endless dialogs. I'm trying to get it so when you've "finished" in each text area it sends an alert
[01:22:46] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ya, cause alert moves the focus
[01:22:57] <fRAiLtY-> I'll try console.log
[01:31:33] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Does .on exist in 1.4.2
[01:31:34] <fRAiLtY->  ?
[01:31:44] <Cork> ?.delegate
[01:31:45] <bot-t> .delegate(selector, eventType, handler): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[01:32:27] <fRAiLtY-> Gotcha
[01:32:43] <Cork> notice that the argument order differ
[01:37:45] <MrS1lentcz> does exist the way, how can i detect if element is visible in scrolled box? is(:visible) returns true allways...
[01:38:43] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: you would have to grab the elements position().top on scroll
[01:39:04] <Cork> and then see if it is within the overflow area
[01:41:43] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  How to get this line to execute a function called update_preview: jQuery('.zetaprints-page-input-fields').on('focus', 'textarea', function() {
[01:41:56] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: mmmm, its good idea :)
[01:42:09] <Cork> jQuery('.zetaprints-page-input-fields').on('focus', 'textarea', update_preview) ?
[01:42:23] <Cork> or jQuery('.zetaprints-page-input-fields').on('focus', 'textarea', function() { update_preview() })
[01:45:07] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Having issues, take a look here: http://dev3.printpartnerships.com/invite-1.html You can see the update preview button, when clicked I think that fires update_preview(), trying to get that to fire on each text area edit, but getting update_preview is not defined?
[01:46:38] <Cork> ya, cause you have no update_preview function
[01:47:19] <Cork> also you have double </script> tags there
[01:55:05] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: can i have the last question? :))
[01:55:13] <fRAiLtY-> Hmm, Cork, how do I tell which function is being fired when "Update Preview" is clicked
[01:55:46] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: uh, by checking what functions you have bound for the event
[01:55:56] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: what question?
[01:56:53] <MrS1lentcz> Cork: i need catch click event in all document, but i have to know if to be clicked inside choosen object (all element tree), is the way?
[01:58:29] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: try rephrase that, i can't follow the question
[01:59:26] <Cork> MrS1lentcz: you can bind a click handler on document, and then use event.target to see what element was clicked
[01:59:45] <Cork> $(document).on('click', function(event) { event.target });
[01:59:52] <Cork> not sure if that covers what your looking for
[02:00:03] <Cork> *you're
[02:09:45] <andrewSC> how do you just add an attribute to an element without a value?
[02:09:45] <Cork> dom doesn't support that
[02:09:45] <Cork> what are you trying to do?
[02:09:45] <andrewSC> well then why the hell would they give me examples with that crap
[02:09:45] <andrewSC> http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/dropdown.html
[02:09:45] <Cork> cause html does support it
[02:10:07] <Cork> $().attr('data-dropdown-content', '')
[02:10:07] <Cork> it will create data-dropdown-content=""
[02:10:07] <Cork> but that should be close enough
[02:10:12] <andrewSC> I wish this would just work.....
[02:10:12] <Cork> wow thats a big netsplit...
[02:10:13] <andrewSC> hmm
[02:10:13] <andrewSC> i have filtering on so i didn't see it
[02:13:57] <Cork> yikes!
[02:17:11] <fRAiLtY-> Hi, I'm trying to imitate the process of clicking the "Update preview" button on focus instead of having to click the button, http://dev3.printpartnerships.com/invite-1.html - I think what happens is "{zp: zp}, update_preview" If this is correct, how to incorporate this into jQuery('.zetaprints-page-input-fields').on('focus', 'textarea', function() {})
[02:17:32] * webchao struggles to understand the benefits of Deferred/promises as opposed to simple event bindings/callbacks
[02:17:46] <fRAiLtY-> ?
[02:18:38] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: like i said before; you don't have any update_preview function defined, so it won't work
[02:19:01] <Cork> also {zp: zp}, update_preview isn't a valid syntax
[02:22:03] <fRAiLtY-> Cork, I have checked for bound events on the zp-update-preview-form-button and that, in zp-personalisation-form.js, is bound like so: var $update_preview_button = $('#zp-update-preview-form-button'); later on in that file it gets bound thus: $update_preview_button.click({zp: zp}, update_preview);
[02:25:48] <fRAiLtY-> So am I not right in thinking that clicking that button = click({zp: zp}, update_preview);
[02:25:51] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: that function is defined in another scope
[02:25:51] <Cork> though that said the simplest thing to do might be to just do $('#zp-update-preview-form-button').click()
[02:25:52] <fRAiLtY-> But the click already works, I'm trying to imitate it in the focus method
[02:26:29] <Cork> uh... you want to trigger the click on the button on focus
[02:27:21] <fRAiLtY-> Cork, currently the system works by people filling out the text fields then having to click the update preview button. As there's 5+ text fields I want it to update when they swap from text field to text field, seemingly automatically, that's all....
[02:27:32] <EvilNo0B> disconnected , did anyone reply ? :P
[02:27:38] <teeceepee> Cork
[02:27:41] <teeceepee> what a name :p
[02:27:52] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: so trigger the button click of focus change
[02:27:56] <Cork> like i said
[02:28:07] <james_woods> Hi, I'm looking for a way to turn a simple select menu with optgroups into something where the optgroups are unfolding (so the menu as a whole does not take the full screen size) - just as in the good old Windows 95 Start Menu ;)
[02:28:28] <Cork> EvilNo0B: there was a massive netsplit, you might have to ask again
[02:28:47] <Cork> james_woods: you would have to replace the entire select element
[02:29:01] <EvilNo0B> Cork ok:) good that i still have the history so
[02:29:02] <EvilNo0B> i just started with jquery , oh what the hell , im a total zero in java right now, BUT , right now I'm willing to write a custom php news script, a very simple one . the question is , should i work on it as planned OR there is a better way doing it with jquery? the thing is the script will have to be VERY small , as small as possible , about 3 - 5 files.
[02:29:16] <james_woods> Cork: that is not a problem I guess..its a Rails 3.2 app
[02:29:18] <yaw> when I animte resize an image its fine, but when I at the same time position it the animation becomes horrible... what do? :S
[02:29:39] <Cork> james_woods: well it is, as you would have to reimplement the element with js
[02:30:16] <james_woods> Cork: thats ugly. is there another way?
[02:30:40] <Cork> EvilNo0B: i can't find the question in there, only a lot of statements
[02:31:27] <Cork> james_woods: no, cause the select element isn't style-able
[02:31:36] <james_woods> Cork:  maybe using jquery menu ?
[02:31:38] <Cork> so if you want to style it you need to replace it
[02:31:50] <james_woods> Cork: what if I move away from a select menu?
[02:31:53] <Cork> james_woods: that is an example of a replacement option that might work
[02:32:03] <EvilNo0B> Cork the question is , will it be much lighter if he script will be writen with php&jquery ? or better just doing it only in php ?
[02:32:06] <Cork> james_woods: jquery menu is an example of moving away from it
[02:32:28] <Cork> EvilNo0B: jquery isn't server side
[02:32:44] <Cork> EvilNo0B: it is a way to have something happen client side
[02:33:05] <Cork> EvilNo0B: for example pulling the server for updates and then update just the part of the page where the update needs to happen
[02:33:12] <EvilNo0B> Cork but some parts like showing short news etc or link generation parts , could be done with jquery no ?
[02:33:17] <Cork> instead of reloading the entire page every 5 seconds
[02:33:42] <Cork> EvilNo0B: eh... maybe, maybe not
[02:33:51] <Cork> that depends on how you prefer to send the data from the server
[02:34:06] <Cork> jquery might just get a small html section and then replace content in the page
[02:34:14] <Cork> or you might send it json, and it can generate elements from it
[02:34:24] <Cork> the later tends to be slower though
[02:35:42] <james_woods> Thanks, I think I will try to move the whole thing to bootstrap and work with their menus
[02:36:32] <EvilNo0B> Cork oh , well the script is gonna be like just pulling out news from a database , now i was woundering if its possible somehow to mix it up with jquery so for example even small things like "Read More" instead of going to a new page would just scroll down the short news and make all other news disappear , hard to explain lol but that would make whole script work with 3 files 1 for functions and db connection 1 for administration and 1 for showing
[02:36:32] <EvilNo0B> news which would basically just included to any html
[02:37:15] <Cork> EvilNo0B: yes it can
[02:37:32] <Cork> but that doesn't really have anything to do with updating
[02:37:36] <Cork> its event handling
[02:38:25] <EvilNo0B> Oh okay meaning the php will have to be the same anyways and the jquery would just play a template effect role right?
[02:39:07] <Cork> EvilNo0B: kinda
[02:39:17] <Cork> EvilNo0B: not exactly
[02:40:36] <EvilNo0B> Cork , thought it would be easier since i dont know how to make php to generate working stable links for "full news" -_- can't even find any working php irc for an advice what to look for at the php wiki x,x
[02:41:33] <Cork> EvilNo0B: your question is a bit generic in nature so it is hard to answer with how to do it
[02:41:37] <EvilNo0B> tried to make a script but all it does is showing all news full , or short with the strlen , but no idea how to generate a whole new page for full article
[02:41:45] <Cork> EvilNo0B: but generically what the flow should be:
[02:42:20] <Cork> 1. the page loads normally, 2. jquery makes an ajax call to the server to pull for updates, 3. the server generates the new html needed 4. jquery adds the new html to the page
[02:42:41] <Cork> and possibly 1b. jquery overrides the link actions with a javascript based one
[02:55:06] <finnnnnnnnnnn> elli, if I have an array of strings, var titles = ['foo', 'bar'], is there a succinct way titles using that array? $('h2').html(titles) doesn't work/
[02:55:41] <Cork> finnnnnnnnnnn: you want to create a title of each string?
[02:55:53] <finnnnnnnnnnn> yeah
[02:56:06] <finnnnnnnnnnn> actually, no. the elements are already on the page
[02:56:12] <finnnnnnnnnnn> no need to creat, just to set
[02:56:38] <Cork> ah
[02:57:14] <Cork> try $('h2').each(function(index) { $(this).text(titles[index]); })
[02:58:35] <haiQt> Hey guys, has anyone had any success with getting Flexslider2 to work on IE? It works if I set my animationType to 'fade' instead of 'slide', but the weird thing is that Modernizr says CSS transitions etc are enabled in IE so I can't really switch the animationType based on feature detection. Any ideas?
[02:59:29] <finnnnnnnnnnn> Cork: that'll do, thanks
[02:59:46] <mazzachre> Is this the best way?? if ($('input[type="radio"]:checked,input[type="checkbox"]:checked', e).length + $(':input[type!="checkbox"][type!="radio"][value!=""]', e).length)
[02:59:46] <MrS1lentcz> where can i change priority of click callbacks?
[03:00:21] <mazzachre> Testing each element in a list if it contains an input type element with a value set
[03:00:38] <mazzachre> MrS1lentcz: You can't
[03:01:10] <yaw> http://jsfiddle.net/hAsbS/22/ number 1 smooths horribly while number 2 smooths fine (resize), how can I get smooth ok while positioning???
[03:01:11] <mazzachre> MrS1lentcz: Anyway, if you need stuff done in a particular order, you are doing it wrong... Event based programming is non-dependant
[03:01:41] <Cork> mazzachre: $(':input', e).filter('[type="radio"]:checked, [type="checkbox"]:checked, [type!="checkbox"][type!="radio"][value!=""]').length
[03:02:25] <evenicoulddoit> Hi guys, I was wondering if it's possible to have a sortable list where the event is only triggered on a child of each node. i.e. I have a box, and I only want a small div in the box to intiate the sortable action? I've had a quick look in the API and I didn't see anything which immediately sprung out

[03:15:17] <jay> hello can some one help me here with jquery multiple array..http://tinker.io/acbed/1
[03:16:16] <teeceepee> anyone, how do I cast an object into a boolean
[03:16:30] <teeceepee> an object with not property should be false, otherwise true
[03:16:34] <teeceepee> no*
[03:16:41] <Cork> jay: what are you trying to do?
[03:16:58] <Cork> jay: also you have two ready function nested inside each other
[03:17:23] <jay> thanks.. i want to minus remaining value as i enter amount.
[03:17:23] <jay> ok
[03:17:44] <Cork> ?eval !!1 @ teeceepee
[03:17:47] <bot-t> teeceepee: true
[03:17:52] <Cork> ?eval !!0 @ teeceepee
[03:17:52] <bot-t> teeceepee: false
[03:18:45] <teeceepee> ?eval obj = {}; !!obj
[03:18:46] <bot-t> teeceepee: true
[03:18:57] <teeceepee> ?eval obj = {'prop': 'val'}; !!obj
[03:18:57] <bot-t> teeceepee: true
[03:19:03] <teeceepee> Cork ^
[03:19:06] <Cork> you can't compare objects
[03:19:10] <jay> but when i enter amount.. in both textboxes the value changes. i want to avoid that. If i enter amount for id 1
[03:19:20] <jay> http://tinker.io/acbed/2
[03:19:30] <teeceepee> so I can't cast an object into boolean Cork
[03:19:32] <Cork> teeceepee: a variable points to an object, as long as there is an object, the variable has a value
[03:19:41] <jay> cork here it is
[03:19:43] <Cork> teeceepee: you can, but it will always be true
[03:22:18] <fRAiLtY-> Can you combine a keydown and focus event? So it matches both terms, i.e. once selected AND something is typed = action
[03:22:43] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you can combine them so both events trigger the same function
[03:22:45] <jay> have u solved that?
[03:22:53] <Cork> but not so they depend on each other
[03:23:01] <fRAiLtY-> Ah, damn
[03:23:40] <teeceepee> I have an idea, I will convert the object to a string
[03:23:57] <fRAiLtY-> Ok, if I'm using jQuery('.zetaprints-page-input-fields').on('focus', 'textarea', function() {}) to select some text area's how to ignore the first one?
[03:24:22] <Cork> teeceepee: that won't really work either, cause two object with the same content, can result in different strings
[03:24:52] <Cork> teeceepee: the only way to so it reliably is by looping the object and check each member and it's value (recursively)
[03:25:07] <teeceepee> ?eval obj = {}; JSON.stringify(obj).length > 2
[03:25:07] <bot-t> teeceepee: false
[03:25:18] <teeceepee> ?eval obj = {"prop": "val"}; JSON.stringify(obj).length > 2
[03:25:18] <bot-t> teeceepee: true
[03:25:26] <teeceepee> Cork that works
[03:25:42] <Cork> if you just want to check if it has members do Object.keys(obj).length
[03:26:02] <teeceepee> nice
[03:26:14] <Cork> though some ie's doesn't support that
[03:26:22] <Cork> so you might have to have a compatibility shim
[03:26:43] <jay> hello cork
[03:26:58] <Cork> ?.isemptypbject @ teeceepee
[03:27:03] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find ".isemptypbject" in jQuery Docs.
[03:27:22] <Cork> ?isemptyobject
[03:27:22] <bot-t> jQuery.isEmptyObject(object): Check to see if an object is empty (contains no properties). http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.isEmptyObject/

[03:29:13] <teeceepee> Cork thanks
[03:29:33] <yaw> :<
[03:32:07] <Cork> jay: your page structure doesn't really support the code the way you wrote it
[03:32:23] <mazzachre> Cork: thx
[03:32:30] <Cork> jay: you have multiple remaning fields, so you need to group them so you can work with the related element
[03:32:44] <jay> can u plz solve that issue?
[03:33:09] <Cork> jay: i'm not here to code it for you :)
[03:33:18] <Cork> i'm here to help you figure out how to do it
[03:36:55] <pedda> hi all
[03:37:19] <pedda> i have problems understanding a jsonp call
[03:37:21] <pedda> i have found some basic coe, which kinda works, as it returnes data to my console, but i would like how to save the result to a var?
[03:38:19] <Cork> pedda: are you using $.ajax, $.getJSON or something else for your request?
[03:38:27] <pedda> $.ajax
[03:38:30] <jay> can some help me with..http://tinker.io/acbed/3
[03:39:01] <Cork> jay: address the problems you've been told about and you will get it fixed
[03:39:04] <pedda> @Cork
[03:39:39] <Cork> pedda: ajax takes either a success callback or a .done(function(data) {}) as a chain function
[03:39:43] <cusco> bom dia
[03:39:45] <cusco> oops
[03:39:46] <Cork> they will be triggered with the data
[03:40:01] <Cork> pedda: the first argument to your callback is the data
[03:45:22] <pedda> Cork : i actually use success: function(data) { ...
[03:45:33] <Cork> then it should work
[03:45:35] <pedda> but i'm not sure if data is accessible at this place
[03:45:39] <pedda> okay
[03:45:58] <Cork> as long as the servers returns the correct javascript
[03:46:12] <motaka2> What do u usually do when your ajax request fail ?
[03:46:34] <Cork> motaka2: pop a dialog
[03:46:45] <Cork> then the user at lest know why
[03:47:06] <Cork> another nice thing is try try to do a ping back to the server to get a log about it
[03:47:17] <motaka2> Cork: is it right to json_encode 200kb of html ?
[03:47:23] <Cork> that might not be needed if the normal server logs cover it though
[03:47:38] <Cork> motaka2: if you want to send more then just html, yes
[03:47:49] <Cork> else no
[03:48:30] <motaka2> Cork: I have a VPS but ome time 200kb takes me 40secs to get a reply, what should I do ?
[03:48:51] <Cork> check where the time is spent
[03:49:06] <Cork> i suspect it is sql query, or possible slow server code
[03:49:22] <Cork> 200kb or html shouldn't be a network problem
[03:49:27] <Cork> or==of
[03:49:30] <motaka2> how can I check ? with what tool ?
[03:49:45] <Cork> motaka2: timers in the server code is a good start
[03:49:54] <Cork> or rather timestamps
[03:50:06] <motaka2> Cork: I dont know what they are
[03:50:15] <Cork> what language?
[03:50:18] <motaka2> PHP
[03:51:11] <motaka2> + apache +mysql
[03:51:25] <Cork> motaka2: $start = time(); /* exec */ $end = time() - $start;
[03:52:06] <motaka2> Cork: you mean I have to place them on server ? one in the begining of the file the other on the end ?
[03:52:17] <Cork> if you want to be fanatic about it you can use microtime()
[03:52:23] <Cork> motaka2: yes
[03:53:24] <motaka2> Cork: I have written my own MVC in PHP and maybe it doesnt work well. I want to know what is normal time to get 200kb from serveron browser, I use a VPS
[03:54:01] <Cork> motaka2: impossible to tell
[03:54:19] <motaka2> How much would that take on urs?
[03:54:25] <Cork> it depends on network speed, if it is compressed or not, the power of the cpu on the server
[03:54:32] <Cork> what the server script code does
[03:54:51] <Cork> the connection delay for the sql server
[03:54:54] <Cork> the speed on the sql server
[03:54:57] <Cork> and so on
[03:55:26] <Cork> motaka2: that is why you need to break it down to see where the cost is
[03:55:38] <Cork> and then start by trying to reduce that
[03:56:02] <motaka2> Cork: my clients complain about speed, sometime ajax requests never get a reply, do you think in case an ajax request fails I can abort that request and reload the whole page via none-ajax methods?
[03:56:35] <Cork> motaka2: if you normally see a delay of 40 sec, i think you might hit the timeout of the connection
[03:56:58] <pedda> Cork: this is my aproach: http://pastebin.com/cp195fS6
[03:57:03] <Cork> motaka2: and like i said, you should look at the problem server side instead of client side
[03:57:27] <Cork> pedda: contentType: "application/json", is wrong
[03:57:34] <motaka2> Cork: So I shoul reload the age via ajax? is it possible to abort an ajax request which was sent to server?
[03:57:54] <Cork> motaka2: ajax or no ajax doesn't matter
[03:58:00] <Cork> find what takes time...
[03:58:54] <motaka2> Cork: ok
[03:59:39] <Cork> pedda: as far as i know you can't send json encoding in a get request
[03:59:41] <motaka2> pedda: async:false; is not a good practice in ajax requests also we dont have content type
[03:59:52] <pedda> hmm
[03:59:56] <Cork> motaka2: actually we do
[04:00:06] <Cork> just normally not for get requests
[04:00:11] <motaka2> Cork: we do but it is just json
[04:00:24] <pedda> the point is i get some unexpected tocen : in my console.. when i hit the file containing this : i can see the json i expect to get
[04:00:26] <Cork> motaka2: no contentType is for the request encoding, not response
[04:00:45] <pedda> using json for the first time
[04:00:48] <motaka2> Cork: You are right
[04:00:51] <Cork> pedda: your not expected to get json on a jsonp request
[04:01:14] <Cork> your expected to get a javascript response that calls a function
[04:01:20] <Cork> and passes the json to the function it calls
[04:01:23] <pedda> oh.. i should rather expect to see some data to iterate through?
[04:01:28] <Cork> THAT is jsonp
[04:01:45] <Cork> pedda: in the raw transfer
[04:01:51] <pedda> okay
[04:01:58] <Cork> json is something like {"key":value}
[04:02:01] <pedda> some mystery solved ;)
[04:02:08] <pedda> and that'S what i see
[04:02:10] <Cork> jsonp is something like callback({"key":value})
[04:02:29] <Cork> but the name of the function is passed to the server in the jsonp request
[04:02:36] <Cork> ?jsonp
[04:02:37] <bot-t> JSONP, Quickly « plaintext - http://niryariv.wordpress.com/2009/05/05/jsonp-quickly/ , What is JSONP? - http://remysharp.com/2007/10/08/what-is-jsonp/ - set the dataType for .ajax() to 'jsonp' if using .getJSON() see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/#jsonp
[04:03:18] <Cork> pedda: jsonp loads a javascript from a third party server and then executes it, and expects it to call a defined function with the return value
[04:04:15] <haiQt> Hey guys, has anyone had any success with getting Flexslider2 to work on IE? It works if I set my animationType to 'fade' instead of 'slide', but the weird thing is that Modernizr says CSS transitions etc are enabled in IE so I can't really switch the animationType based on feature detection. Any ideas?
[04:04:52] <Krinkle> jay: Not sure why you pinged me in PM earlier, but (now that I'm back) did you solve your problem?
[04:23:55] <Hooloovo1>  /j javascript
[04:23:57] <Hooloovo1> wops
[04:40:45] <marcc> sup bitches
[04:41:08] <marcc> what the hell is this: 2013-07-04T09:30:19Z
[04:41:21] <marcc> json output for a datetime field in a db
[04:41:25] <marcc> is that normal?
[04:43:33] <sysdef> marcs: yes. please refer http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime
[04:45:11] <m4rc> sysdef so how would i parse through that and return Jul 7, 2013
[04:45:51] <sysdef> do you send the database/sql query?
[04:46:08] <m4rc> what?
[04:46:38] <iRc123> Could someone tell me what I am doing wrong write here: http://gyazo.com/eb46d82e45ba6ea3b4674eabdc862290
[04:46:40] <sysdef> what DB? -> "json output for a datetime field in a db"
[04:46:49] <iRc123> right here*
[04:47:01] <m4rc> sysdef postgres
[04:47:26] <sysdef> and you are sending the DB query to the DB?
[04:47:27] <m4rc> they question is. how do i parse through 2013-07-04T09:30:19Z so it outputs Jul 7, 2013
[04:47:33] <m4rc> doenst have anything to do with the DB
[04:48:28] <m4rc> db/api/etc. string is 2013-07-04T09:30:19Z and i need to parse through it
[04:48:42] <sysdef> better do it in your query to get a useful result instead of parsing a not useful DB reply
[04:48:46] <sysdef> http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.2/static/functions-formatting.html
[04:49:16] <sysdef> a postgress function is way faster and smarter than parsing it in JS
[04:49:18] <MrS1lentcz> mmm, i dont know how can i get into motion content with scrollbar manually, any ideas, please? :)
[04:49:27] <hkraal_> w
[04:49:58] <m4rc> dude, i dont need a db function
[04:50:03] <m4rc> im contacting an API
[04:50:11] <m4rc> its returning a string in that format
[04:50:17] <sysdef> m4rc: but nevertheless: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4829569/help-parsing-iso-8601-date-in-javascript
[04:51:50] <sysdef> or http://developer.tickster.com/json/dates-and-json
[04:52:36] <m4rc> thanks
[04:52:45] <m4rc> nvm
[04:52:48] <m4rc> still doesnt work
[04:53:22] <m4rc> Date.parse('1997-07-16T19:20:15Z') returns null

[05:01:38] <krz> when i meet him online again
[05:01:39] <evenicoulddoit> Hi guys, I was wondering if it's possible to have a sortable list where the event is only triggered on a child of each node. i.e. I have a box, and I only want a small div in the box to intiate the sortable action? I've had a quick look in the API and I didn't see anything which immediately sprung out
[05:04:25] <sysdef> krz: k
[05:08:25] <iRc123> What am I doing wrong? http://gyazo.com/eb46d82e45ba6ea3b4674eabdc862290
[05:11:40] <Notte> iRc123: knowing what's the problem can help.
[05:12:51] <Cork> iRc123: might be that you arn't waiting for dom ready
[05:13:01] <Cork> only a guess though
[05:15:14] <iRc123> Notte I want to change the css of .about when I click .forgot-password
[05:16:53] <Notte> You likely put the script in the wrong place, as Cork's said. Try to put the script at the bottom of <body>.
[05:19:08] <iRc123> Notte You were right. How do I know where to put it - for future reference
[05:19:42] <Cork> iRc123: $(document).ready(function() {})
[05:19:44] <seutje> always at the bottom unless it's a library that specifically states it should be loaded first
[05:19:53] <Cork> that means it will wait for the dom to stabilize
[05:21:42] <Notte> iRc123: you've to put the script after the part of the DOM it needs to access or manipulate.
[05:22:37] <Notte> $(function () { /* my code */ }) is also working.
[05:27:01] <n3ssi3> Hi, I'm trying to style Radiobuttons, checkboxes,... and validate them... the styling is now already there, done with overlays. But now I'm running into a problem with validation. My Framework sets classes like "validation-failed" to radios,...but now I need them as well on the overlay for styling. I came this far: http://pastie.org/8124343  the problem now
[05:27:01] <n3ssi3> is, that I have an endless loop :p is there some "trick" to prevent either the endless loop, or even better, a nicer way to check on event addClass ?
[05:27:23] <iRc123> Notte: What about this slugger -> http://gyazo.com/7383aa2c0b18bf345d1091337db874e3
[05:28:25] <seutje> iRc123: ur anonymous function is unclosed?
[05:28:37] <Cork> n3ssi3: a better option would prob be to extend the validation framework instead of jquery
[05:28:55] <Cork> n3ssi3: extend the function that runs the validation, and then when it has run check the classes
[05:30:28] <n3ssi3> Cork: hmm maybe your right.. I'm going to have a look at that...but I think It's not that easy, since they have everything in one file...and I would rather not overwrite the whole file
[05:30:57] <Cork> n3ssi3: when you extend in javascript you don't modify files
[05:31:06] <Cork> n3ssi3: you modify the generated objects they expose
[05:31:17] <Cork> and if they are written in an extendable way it shouldn't be too hard
[05:31:34] <seutje> here's to hoping the useful stuff isn't hidden like it usually seems to be
[05:31:53] <n3ssi3> Cork: IF ... :p but it seems this file is ;) thx
[05:36:18] <Notte> iRc123: instead of onclick="..." (that is a bad practice) bind a click event listener
[05:36:49] <iRc123> Notte: Started with this literarly 1 hour ago. :) anyways, what about now. It just fades out: http://gyazo.com/295cfcf36d9f9ce158d414c5fa07f4ed
[05:36:55] <X_Panni_X> Hello everyone ^-^  Is someone here who could help me with jquery and div containers?
[05:37:46] <Cork> ?ask @ X_Panni_X
[05:37:46] <bot-t> X_Panni_X, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[05:38:49] <iRc123> I appriciate the tip though
[05:39:23] <X_Panni_X> I'm having a function that gets triggers when an selecting list (?) gets changed to another value. Now I want this function to change the display type of an div container in the index.php?
[05:40:29] <_Jens> and what's your problem specifically?
[05:40:48] <Saaether> `api css @ X_Panni_X
[05:41:13] <Saaether> err some one change that command?
[05:41:18] <X_Panni_X> Yea I know that it is .css("display", "inline"); but I don't know how I can access that specific DIV Container
[05:41:33] <X_Panni_X> in the index.html
[05:41:54] <Cork> Saaether: b-ot is down
[05:41:59] <Cork> ?css
[05:42:00] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[05:43:10] <X_Panni_X> bot-t: I know but how can I apply that to an DIV Container in another file?
[05:43:10] <bot-t> X_Panni_X, It is decidedly so.
[05:43:34] <Saaether> what do you mean another file?
[05:43:56] <X_Panni_X> the function is in "script.js" the div container is in the "index.php"
[05:44:50] <Saaether> and script.js is included in index.php?
[05:45:02] <Cork> X_Panni_X: web don't have a concept of files
[05:45:12] <X_Panni_X> Saaether:   yea
[05:45:15] <Cork> X_Panni_X: it is current document and for javascript scope
[05:45:21] <Saaether> then they are on the same page
[05:45:31] <Saaether> just reference it by id or class
[05:46:02] <Saaether> or what ever other way you might want to select it heh
[05:46:13] <X_Panni_X> then it would be: "control-group extras".css("display", "inline"); ?
[05:46:28] <Saaether> are those classes?
[05:46:42] <X_Panni_X> yea: <div class="control-group extras" style="display: none;">
[05:46:58] <Cork> $('.control-group.extras').css()
[05:48:11] <zmo> hi
[05:48:16] <X_Panni_X> Cork: Thanks dude, it's working :)
[05:50:01] <zmo> I'm using JQuery.ajax(), with `dataType="script"` set to load a quite big script resource when it is actually needed... thing is that "quite big script resource" needs to have an `id` attribute on the `<script>` tag it is loaded from
[05:50:35] <Cork> zmo: $.ajax doesn't use a script tag
[05:50:36] <zmo> and I'm just not sure if it is possible or how I can specify that `<script>` tag
[05:50:44] <zmo> err that id attribute
[05:50:50] <Cork> ?globalEval
[05:50:50] <bot-t> jQuery.globalEval(code): Execute some JavaScript code globally. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.globalEval/
[05:51:34] <zmo> so $.ajax executes the code through globalEval ?
[05:51:38] <Cork> yes
[05:51:51] <Cork> and globalEval is a wrapper around eval
[05:51:57] <Cork> so no script tag
[05:52:32] <zmo> so there's no "nice" way I can defer the script loading that relies on its "id" tag (by using $.ajax or another method..)
[05:53:38] <Cork> $('<script>').attr({ src: 'url', id:'something' }).appendTo(document.head)
[05:53:57] <Cork> or body if you want it there
[05:54:37] <zmo> oh, reading at the script's source code, actually I can make an empty <script> tag and it'll work
[05:55:16] <zmo> thank you Cork
[05:56:58] <zmo> whao, I crashed firefox ;-)
[05:57:28] <Cork> zmo: could you grab me the crashreport for that?
[05:57:39] <Cork> in about:crashes ?
[05:57:51] <Cork> (the id is enough)
[06:07:03] <iRc123> Why doesn't this fade in? http://gyazo.com/7c58f4999ded101b5a345695ab958e58
[06:18:49] <Cork> iRc123: next is defined inside the callback function not outside it
[06:20:01] <zmo> Cork - I don't have about:crashes
[06:20:13] <Cork> zmo: what os?
[06:21:19] <zmo> I'm running debian, and iceweasel 23.0a2 (2013-05-17)
[06:21:23] <Cork> ah
[06:21:34] <Cork> ya, the crash reporting is disabled in the repo builds
[06:22:28] <zmo> uhuh that's stupid
[06:22:36] <zmo> but it's actually crashing when I debug using firebug
[06:22:38] <Cork> there isn't really an option
[06:23:03] <zmo> I'm having a "too much recursion" error happening
[06:23:12] <Cork> cause the distros compile there own version of firefox; so mozilla doens't have the debug symbols so the crash report wouldn't make any sense
[06:23:53] <zmo> oh ok
[06:24:13] <Cork> and that is one of the reasons why i never use the repo version
[06:24:17] <fRAiLtY-> if I'm using jQuery('.zetaprints-page-input-fields').on('focus', 'textarea', function() {}) to select some text area's how to ignore the first one?
[06:24:31] <mrHAT> ok, so in a product catalog ajax search i need to implement a way to paginate trough results and this is what i came up with now: http://pastebin.com/Jqv0HP7F  basically that function it's called when ajax response is received. It shows the total records found and prepares the paginator navigation (which is a simple next / prev button). Am i doing this right or should i re-think this
[06:24:43] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you could have a global variable and store what was the last focused element
[06:24:44] <wdkevin> is there any reason that .trigger('click') would work 50% of the time?
[06:24:57] <wdkevin> i repeat the same steps over and over and half the time it works, half the time it doesnt
[06:25:06] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Is that a lot of code?
[06:25:06] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: and unless it was a textarea return early
[06:25:12] <Cork> uh no
[06:25:12] <zmo> damn that was my fault, I forgot a recursion stop condition :-)
[06:25:17] <zmo> pebcak spotted
[06:27:15] <mrHAT> sorry, i forgot the button actions : http://pastebin.com/mZKRM6AV
[06:28:09] <mrHAT> i would clean the repeated code i guesss .. but this is raw right now
[06:30:31] <wdkevin> can anyone help me understand why .trigger('click') only fires sometimes?
[06:30:37] <wdkevin> I have it appended to a .attr()
[06:30:45] <wdkevin> and that ALWAYS fires, but the click doesnt
[06:30:50] <wdkevin> no errors, no nothing
[06:31:55] <fRAiLtY-> Cork:  Is this what you mean? http://stackoverflow.com/a/2954335/1496418
[06:52:26] <X_Panni_X> Hello everyone ^-^ Could someone please tell me how I can get the data-extra="1" from this <option field> with jquery? <option value="cloudcarousel" data-extra="1">
[06:52:57] <Cork> $('option[value="cloudcarousel"]').data('extra')
[06:53:25] <X_Panni_X> ok, I'll try this
[06:54:44] <Joel> Any thoughts no how to adjust this selector so I get the last th? http://jsfiddle.net/shAUM/
[06:55:38] <Cork> $('tbody tr th:last-child', this).last()
[06:55:39] <Joel> ahh nm
[06:55:41] <Joel> I got it.
[06:56:00] <Joel> Cork: you shouldn't have to use .last when using last-child
[06:56:14] <Joel> Cork: if you tried the fiddle you'd notice the selector as given returns nothing, so .last wouldn't work.
[06:56:36] <Cork> Joel: last-child will match the last element of the parent
[06:56:44] <Cork> and if th isn't the last child nothing is matched
[06:56:53] <Cork> so $('tbody tr th', this).last() is prob what you want
[06:57:26] <X_Panni_X> Cork: How can I set the "cloudcarousel" to a variable? ( $(this.value) )
[06:57:35] <Joel> Cork: jsfiddle?
[06:58:47] <Cork> Joel: http://jsfiddle.net/shAUM/1/
[06:59:21] <Cork> X_Panni_X: all jquery cases about is that it gets a string, how you construct that string is just plain js
[06:59:40] <Cork> *hint* *hint* ;)
[07:00:22] <Joel> yeah I've got a simpler working solution than that fiddle.
[07:00:55] <Cork> Joel: but ya, it is quite common for ppl to miss that quirk of :last-child
[07:01:01] <Joel> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/shAUM/2/
[07:01:30] <Cork> Joel: that only works on the thead as you see
[07:01:39] <Joel> Cork: which is what I want.
[07:01:50] <Cork> but you checked in tbody in the code you gave before...
[07:02:30] <Joel> Cork: ah fuck, that was the issue.
[07:02:40] <Joel> http://jsfiddle.net/shAUM/3/
[07:02:44] <Joel> the orig, with thead instead of tbody
[07:02:46] <Joel> -fml
[07:03:00] <X_Panni_X> Cork: You're my hero today ^-^ It's working :)
[07:05:28] <wdkevin> jesus wtf
[07:05:32] <wdkevin> .trigger() has a mind of its own
[07:07:33] <wdkevin> why would .trigger work sometimes and not others? i am doing nothing different when it works and when it doesnt
[07:08:13] <vinky> wdkevin, an example of when it doesnt work might help
[07:08:39] <wdkevin> i have some jquery that when you click submit the first time it changes the action on the parent form
[07:08:58] <wdkevin> then when you hit ok in a popup it will close the popup and trigger a click on the submit button again
[07:09:05] <wdkevin> its all chained too
[07:09:24] <wdkevin> $(form).attr('action', 'new_action').trigger('click')
[07:09:34] <wdkevin> EVERY SINGLE TIME the action changes, but it doesnt trigger the click
[07:09:48] <wdkevin> my jquery isnt identical to that as that obviously triggers a click on the form, but it gets my point across
[07:10:06] <wdkevin> its more like $(submit button).parents('form').attr('action', 'new_action').triggger('click')
[07:10:20] <wdkevin> but when i break it down into 2 lines and try to do the click by itselfg, it still doesnt work
[07:16:05] <vinky> wdkevin, an actual (non)working example, a simplified example on jsfiddle is usually preferred here I think
[07:16:54] <wdkevin> yea, unfortunately i just cant do that
[07:17:35] <wdkevin> it uses native elements from the framework it's built on, so it wouldn't work, and to make it work wouldn't be a true test case anyway
[07:19:35] <Bauer1> guys, I have a problem: I am using debounce extension to "collect" events before running a function. Problem is, I want to present a "loading" gif while the debouncer event is collecting clicks.. I am stuck, everything I try either breaks the debouncer, or otherwise not working for loader
[07:19:53] <Bauer1> any ideas how to combine debounce+loader event?
[07:22:24] <Bauer1> Instead of doing like: .change ($.debounce( 800, AdjustSections ) ), I do like change(  TriggerAdjustSections  ) where I do 			function TriggerAdjustSections() {				$.throttle( 800, oggleLoader() );				$.debounce( 800, AdjustSections() );			} - this is not working, debounce stops working when I do that...
[07:24:08] <vinky> wdkevin, native elements?
[07:24:09] <Cork> Bauer1: $.debounce( 800, AdjustSections )()
[07:24:24] <Cork> Bauer1: $.debounce() returns a function
[07:24:46] <wdkevin> vinky, the way the framework handles post and ajax requests. i cant make a jsfiddle because of it.
[07:27:23] <Bauer1> Cork: adding the code produces error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'apply' of undefined
[07:27:39] <Bauer1> which comes from jquery.ba-throttle-debounce.min.js
[07:28:00] <Cork> Bauer1: try $.debounce( 800, AdjustSections ).call(this, event)
[07:29:05] <Bauer1> Cork: still the same error...
[07:29:25] <Cork> not sure then
[07:36:17] <Bauer1> Cork: here is part of the code: http://pastie.org/private/v1px1t52eurtqkwgw11ka you can see line 84 starts everything, then you can see line 14 - this is where debounce stops working
[07:36:29] <Bauer1> and where the error happens if I do .call like you suggested
[07:36:33] <darkfrog> if I have two selectors and want to combine them together into one, is there an easy way to accomplish this?
[07:40:19] <Cork> darkfrog: just add a comma and make one string of them
[07:40:40] <darkfrog> Cork: $(firstSelector, secondSelector)?
[07:40:47] <Cork> no one string
[07:40:52] <Cork> not two string to one call
[07:41:28] <Cork> Bauer1: the base of the problem is that debounce expects to be passed to an event binding
[07:41:39] <darkfrog> Cork: I don't necessarily know what the selector is or if it necessarily even has one (could be a wrapped element directly instead of via selector)
[07:41:43] <Cork> Bauer1: so it generates a function for you
[07:41:55] <Cork> ah
[07:42:02] <Cork> ?.add @ darkfrog
[07:42:02] <bot-t> darkfrog, .add(selector): Add elements to the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/add/
[07:42:47] <darkfrog> ah....I saw that but for some reason I just shrugged it off as synonymous with append. :)
[07:42:59] <Bauer1> Cork: I see :( do you have any other creative ideas how to display a loader, while customer is waiting for the Debounce to finish?
[07:43:24] <Cork> Bauer1: what you do should be possible, but you would have to disect debounce
[07:44:07] <Bauer1> Cork: you mean, customize debounce so that it triggers the ToggleLoader?
[07:44:47] <Cork> no, i mean you need to dissect what $.debounce() does so you can give it the structure it expects
[07:45:09] <monteith> anybody know why this general functionality isn't working on XP's chrome? works on Win7, OSX.  http://jsfiddle.net/pUUKb/
[07:46:54] <darkfrog> Cork and bot-t, that was exactly what I needed. Thanks. :)
[07:47:24] <Cork> darkfrog: bot-t is just a bot :)
[07:47:30] <Cork> though it do like snacks :D
[07:47:35] <Cork> bot-t: botsnack
[07:47:36] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[07:47:58] <Bauer1> Cork:
[07:48:11] <darkfrog> Cork: oops...wasn't paying enough attention and just saw that both of you responded. :o
[07:48:33] <Bauer1> Cork: I dont understand, I know debounce's structure, as it is documented.. what other structure did you mean?
[07:49:03] <Cork> Bauer1: $.demounce() returns a function that is meant to be passed to an event binding
[07:49:19] <Cork> Bauer1: you want to use it in another matter, and you need to take that into account
[07:50:15] <Cork> though that said, i just thought of one thing; you could try .change($.debounce()).change(your_own_function)
[07:52:00] <Bauer1> while the second change calls the ToggleLoader?
[07:53:27] <jop008> I have an <table> with a body the body is created on server by code http://pastebin.com/1eU1UbaX when I fetch the data is is very fast innerhtml displays my table however when I user append it is terrible slow waiting 10 seconds (data is 110 rows)
[07:53:51] <jop008> how to speed this up I ggogled  a lot but the trigger.create is killing performance
[07:54:48] <jop008> When I had the code on the client it was also slow serverd component makes no difference
[07:55:44] <jop008> this is the dom insert code       $.getJSON(curl,function(result){
[07:55:44] <jop008>         $.each(result, function(i, field){
[07:55:45] <jop008>           option_detail_rows.append (field.html);
[07:55:46] <jop008>           option_detail_rows.trigger ("create");
[07:56:02] <jop008> field.html is from server
[07:57:06] <jop008> not all together :-(
[07:58:14] <BillCriswell> jop008: Can you run trigger on the rows after they're added?
[07:58:31] <BillCriswell> after they're all added*
[07:58:36] <jedimind> also dont post code in the channel
[07:58:40] <jedimind> why do we even have to say that any more
[08:02:00] <seutje> paste?
[08:02:19] <seutje> b-ot, bot-t: I GIVE UP!
[08:02:51] <jop008> yes I can
[08:02:58] <airdem> hi guys, i have a little problem with .load() please take a look https://gist.github.com/anonymous/687b305f8387e7d15387
[08:03:08] <jop008> I do an append and then the trigger create
[08:03:22] <jop008> the append is wiith the long html string
[08:03:26] <airdem> oh lol i see the problem.... json uses "" too :)
[08:06:56] <teeceepee> how can I access variables declared within $(document).ready(function(){ ---- HERE ---})
[08:07:06] <teeceepee> from outside
[08:07:13] <Bauer1> Cork: thanks!!! it works beautifully now :)
[08:07:19] <teeceepee> in places such as console, and other scripts...
[08:07:36] <Gho5t> you can't unless you make them global
[08:07:42] <Gho5t> or export them
[08:08:00] <teeceepee> Gho5t how do I make them global or export them ?
[08:08:27] <iRc123> I have these two functions: http://gyazo.com/169dd023a877fd57fe249eb95946db97, now after I've clicked either I cannot click them again to redo the function nor click the other to start a new. Is there an error in the jquery code?
[08:08:41] <Gho5t> best way to make them global would be create a global object as a namespace and add them as properties onto it, and reference them that way
[08:09:10] <Gho5t> e.g. var app = {}; $(document).ready(function(){ app.foo = 'bar'; });
[08:09:23] <BillCriswell> Ugh, why did I assume an ajax request from https to http would go smoothly
[08:09:31] <teeceepee> Gho5t lemme try this
[08:09:56] <teeceepee> Gho5t that has to come before the script loads?
[08:10:42] <Gho5t> I don't believe so due to hoisting
[08:10:58] <teeceepee> hoisting ?
[08:11:06] <Gho5t> google it
[08:11:07] <BillCriswell> Boating term.
[08:11:28] <teeceepee> cool
[08:11:29] <snover> ahoy sting
[08:11:46] <snover> pirate saying hello to a musical artist
[08:11:52] <jop008> so in summary .innerhtml or .html is very quick within one second I have a standard table. Making it a jqm table takes more than 10 seconds using .trigger (create)
[08:12:04] <jop008> so how to improve?
[08:12:17] <snover> don’t use jqm
[08:12:35] <jop008> and what else than?
[08:13:12] <teeceepee> ok so I get undefined for this http://pastebin.com/jB9LXyG2
[08:13:15] <teeceepee> Gho5t
[08:14:20] <jop008> is the table tag slow in jqM?
[08:14:41] <jop008> must I make my table using <div> and stylesheets?
[08:15:42] <jgornick> Hey guys, is it known that when you have more items in a sortable list that the dragging is extremely slow in IE8 and IE9?
[08:15:45] <Gho5t> teeceepee: it might be because you're passing "app" to dom ready for some reason
[08:16:29] <jop008> don't use jqm is not an option I did a lot of investment in learning jqm
[08:16:45] <teeceepee> Gho5t yep thats it
[08:16:58] <arschmitz> jop008 how big is your table?
[08:17:38] <jop008> 110 rows and 8 columns
[08:17:45] <jop008> not that big I should say
[08:18:16] <arschmitz> are you using the reflow or column toggle tables?
[08:21:17] <FortuneDayce> I'm getting weird "quantityBind is not a function" errors when I try to return... things. It might be knockout or it might be me.
[08:21:18] <airdem> will .each() also work for non jquery arrays of objects?
[08:21:23] <traets> $("body").append('<ifr'+'ame src="" style="width:0px; height:0px; border: 0px"></ifr'+'ame>')
[08:21:36] <traets> why do they concatenate <ifr + ame ?
[08:21:41] <teeceepee> thanks Gho5t
[08:21:48] <FortuneDayce> http://jsfiddle.net/6bz7S/1/
[08:21:50] <jwmann> I have a jquery script that wait for an on('click') to perform actions; Would anyone know why the first click doesn't do anything after a fresh page load?
[08:22:38] <FortuneDayce> If you unquote line 34, everything goes wrong because the function that is throwing the error returns something other than a knockout observable
[08:22:49] <jop008> Can I use trigger asynchonously so my browser keeps on going and table is rendered in idle time of the browser?
[08:23:14] <jop008> or are broswers still that dumb that this is not possible/?
[08:23:55] <jop008> A dom refresh trigger seems to stop the whole page
[08:24:34] <arschmitz> jop008: javascript is single threaded
[08:24:40] <jop008> okay
[08:24:53] <jop008> but do you know a solution?
[08:25:18] <jop008> must I use multipe smaller tables for instance?
[08:25:20] <arschmitz> you never answered which table type you are using?
[08:25:36] <jop008> let say after 5 records a new table
[08:25:44] <jop008> table type?
[08:26:05] <arschmitz> yes JQM has reflow tables and column toggle tables
[08:26:53] <jop008> Here is my table http://pastebin.com/eA7ZS1U8
[08:26:59] <jop008> definition
[08:27:18] <beasty> i'm having some issues displaying a .datepicker();
[08:27:21] <jop008> and what is the best to use looking at my situation?
[08:27:36] <beasty> when i issue it in my console $('#el').datepicker();
[08:27:45] <beasty> and the html gets appended to the document
[08:27:57] <beasty> but when the element gets active it's not showing up
[08:28:02] <beasty> and the element doesn't change
[08:28:38] <arschmitz> jop008: that depends on our desired result reflow ( what you have now ) makes the table reflow into a stack on small screens column toggle sets a priority on columns and hides them depending on screen size
[08:29:02] <arschmitz> it looks like you are using parts of both though
[08:29:26] <arschmitz> you are setting priorities but using reflow
[08:29:41] <jop008> I have ttried without reflow
[08:29:46] <jop008> same performance
[08:30:15] <jop008> so what is the best user experience?
[08:30:34] <arschmitz> jop008: i would suggest you make a simple JSBIN test case for your performance issue and file an issue on github
[08:30:58] <jop008> JSBN test casse?
[08:30:59] <arschmitz> and whats best for user experience depends on your data
[08:31:22] <jop008> I have renting options with prices simple enough
[08:31:30] <arschmitz> jop008: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues?direction=desc&sort=created&state=open
[08:31:38] <jop008> like number of garden armchairs etc
[08:31:42] <arschmitz> jop008: http://jsbin.com/uzaret/1/edit
[08:32:02] <arschmitz> make a test case for your performance problem and submit an issue
[08:32:22] <okdamn> i want the first h4 child
[08:32:34] <jop008> but submitting an issue how long would it take when it is solved by average?
[08:32:35] <okdamn> i do $(element).children('h4')[0];
[08:32:36] <okdamn> correct?
[08:33:45] <arschmitz> jop008: it all depends
[08:34:28] <jop008> when I must wait to being solved I can not launch my site
[08:36:48] <jop008> when I have it likes this performance is okay <table data-role="table" id="option_table" class="ui-responsive table-stroke" >
[08:39:11] <teeceepee> Gho5t you just bumped up my js/jquery skills by 100 points !
[08:42:41] <airdem> i want to implement a live search suggestion. whats a good way to display the suggestions below the input flied? what element shall i use?
[08:46:24] <Gho5t> teeceepee: nice
[08:47:03] <Gho5t> it's a pretty simple example of how to get away with using globals if you absolutely have to - create  a namespace so your properties don't collide with others
[08:52:39] <jop008> $html .= "<td><div data-role=\"fieldcontain\">";
[08:52:39] <jop008>         $html .= "<fieldset data-role=\"controlgroup\">";
[08:52:41] <jop008>         $html .= "<input id=" . $cid . $cchecked . " type=\"checkbox\" name=\"checkbox-1\" class=\"custom\" />";
[08:52:42] <jop008>         $html .= "<label for=" . $cid . "></label>";
[08:52:43] <jop008>         $html .= "</fieldset>";
[08:52:44] <jop008>         $html .= "</div></td>";
[08:52:59] <jop008> this is my code how can I have my checkbox centred in the cell?
[08:53:18] <NoiseEee> jop008: never post code in here
[08:53:39] <NoiseEee> jop008: you've been here long enough to know. that will infuriate people and actually decrease the chances someone will help you
[08:53:50] <jop008>  td     text-align: center;   vertical-align:bottom;   }
[08:54:00] <jop008> I use this as my CSS
[08:54:06] <NoiseEee> jop008: not to mention the fact that . is a php concatenator
[08:54:10] <wcwrel> how do i fire off onclick ?
[08:54:17] <wcwrel> and all events attached to it
[08:54:25] <jop008> php?
[08:54:26] <NoiseEee> wcwrel: see 'trigger'
[08:54:38] <wcwrel> does .click() work as well?
[08:54:51] <jedimind> jop008 stop fucking posting code in the channel
[08:55:50] <iRc123> Guys, whats wrong with this code? http://gyazo.com/a52d801575488fc46db36144c5d55806
[08:56:17] <jop008> a css is no code :-)
[08:56:43] <jedimind> jop008 you're kind of retarded, arent you?
[08:57:15] <jedimind> iRc123 what's it not doing?
[08:57:28] <jedimind> iRc123 ps you dont need quotes around the url() param of a background image
[08:57:42] <wcwrel> how do I assign a .click() to a checkbox and then call the anonymous function immediatley?
[08:58:00] <bluesm> To select immediate childresn
[08:58:10] <iRc123> jedimind After i've clicked hearts, if I click it again nothing happens.
[08:58:15] <bluesm> the only way is to find("#container > li"); ?
[08:58:22] <dwarder> how do i remove $('#whatever').on('click', '#somethingElse', ...
[08:58:22] <jedimind> iRc123 can you setup a testcase on jsfiddle.net ?
[08:58:31] <iRc123> k
[08:58:32] <dwarder> so that this click stops working
[08:59:05] <dwarder> by remove i mean to stop responding to this event
[08:59:23] <dwarder> programmaticaly
[08:59:27] <NoiseEee> dwarder: $('#whatever').off('click');
[08:59:43] <dwarder> NoiseEee: what if i have a delegate?
[08:59:44] <wcwrel> so trigger('click') will actually uncheck/check the checkbox
[08:59:45] <wcwrel> that is weird
[08:59:56] <jop008> How do I center a td containing an input checkbox?
[09:00:17] <jop008> the checkbox is left aligned I want to have it in the middle
[09:00:20] <dwarder> NoiseEee: an i have several '#somethingELse'
[09:00:25] <NoiseEee> dwarder: then i'd rewrite the delegate at the time in the same way with off/on
[09:00:26] <dwarder> several different
[09:00:39] <dwarder> NoiseEee: ok thanks
[09:00:55] <NoiseEee> dwarder: otherwise maybe keep a dictionary/lookup of items that should/shouldn't fire and check in your delegate for that condition
[09:03:00] <dwarder> NoiseEee: .off doesn't seem to work ..
[09:03:06] <dwarder> NoiseEee: it still fires
[09:03:09] <jgornick> Hey guys, any ideas why the sortable performance is horrible in IE8 for http://jsfiddle.net/jgornick/Przxf/
[09:03:45] <dwarder> NoiseEee: is it ok that i am doing .off inside it's .on
[09:04:09] <dwarder> NoiseEee: i want the button to be clicked only once
[09:04:51] <NitroLiq> Hi folks, I'm using Corey Snyders jquery sticky footer for Foundation 4 (https://github.com/coreysyms/foundationStickyFooter) and while it works, I'm finding that there is an issue when the page loads where it jumps to the bottom of the screen. Anyone have any ideas how I can eliminate this?
[09:05:26] <NitroLiq> you can see an example here: http://mdsol.com/conferences/ipad/media.html
[09:05:54] <NitroLiq> If you view and refresh the page, you'll see it jump.

[09:11:22] <jop008> how do I center my <td><input </td> elements?
[09:11:59] <jop008> Or is jqm uses it own style which can't be changed?
[09:17:28] <aquarius> If I'm writing a plugin which creates an object from some DOM objects and I want to allow some properties to be changed after creation, what's the best way? For example, a thing which emulates input type=range (such as http://refreshless.com/nouislider/); if I want to add a new property, "lines", then I understand how to set that at instantiation time: $(whatever).noUiSlider({lines: 5}). But... what if I want to change
[09:17:28] <aquarius>  the value of "lines" later on, after the thing is created? I can think of a few ways to do it, but what's the "jQuery-ish" way?
[09:31:39] <arschmitz> aquarius: use the widget factory it handles issues like this
[09:32:01] <ph88> i want a job at the widget factory
[09:32:10] <igcewieling1> I'm a bit of a n00b.   Should this work to update an element in the parent from inside an iframe (no cross domain issues, same host, same port):  window.parent.$('#upload_status').html('Decoding: ');
[09:32:26] <ph88> it's okay to be n00b, we luuuuv n00bs :D
[09:32:34] <aquarius> blimey, I don't even know what the widget factory is. Time to rtfm a bit, clearly ;)
[09:32:38] <igcewieling1> I/m mostly concerned about the window.parent. part.
[09:33:19] <aquarius> arschmitz, er... the widget factory is for jQuery UI, as far as I can tell? Not just jQuery?
[09:33:43] <igcewieling1> I'm trying to figure out if the response is not being seen as javascript or if the actual call to .html() is wtong.
[09:34:26] <aquarius> igcewieling1, is jQuery loaded in the parent as well as in the frame?
[09:34:40] <igcewieling1> jquery is only loaded in the parent
[09:34:48] <aquarius> yeah, that's what I meant. :)
[09:34:57] <igcewieling1> I assumed it did not need to be loaded in the iframe since it is trying to use the parent.
[09:35:02] <aquarius> *nod* that's what I think
[09:35:07] * aquarius briefly experiments
[09:35:51] <igcewieling1> aquarius: don't send too much time on it.   I thought maybe I was doing something obviously wrong.
[09:39:03] <aquarius> igcewieling1, works fine for me in testing here
[09:39:26] <igcewieling1> I must be doing something else wrong. 8-|  thanks for checking.
[09:39:53] <aquarius> I'd try console.logging window, window.parent, window.parent.$, window.parent.$('#upload_status') ...
[09:40:21] <aquarius> igcewieling1, http://paste.ubuntu.com/5858903/ works for me
[09:41:10] <aquarius> igcewieling1, you're testing this on a web server, right? Not with file:// URLs? file: URLs will screw you because they have origin null, which compares not equal to origin null in another file URL frame :)
[09:41:32] <igcewieling1> aquarius: correct.
[09:41:47] <aquarius> then, don't know, sorry :)
[09:45:19] <mentoc> Is there a clear definition of scope when inside a closure?
[09:45:55] <mentoc> var bar = 1; foo.on("click",function(){ console.log(bar); } //would that print 1 ?
[09:46:08] <aquarius> yes, it would.
[09:48:48] <jgornick> Hey guys, just wanted to make sure I'm not going crazy, but is draggable/droppable/sortable performance in IE8 and IE9 extremely slow? Is there a replacement to help speed up the mousemove handlers?
[09:48:51] <jop008> If i have a long table how can I freeze my header row?
[09:53:29] <jop008> freeze table top header row in jquery mobile ? how to do this?
[09:58:08] <Shadda> 'ello. I've got a jquery function, defined like this: $.fn.foo = function() …
[09:58:22] <Shadda> I'm using it like this, $('#bar').foo(function() { … })
[09:58:32] <Shadda> I'd like 'this' to refer to $('#bar') in the callback
[09:58:46] <Shadda> I know jquery does that for a few functions but I'm not sure how, since you can't reassign this
[09:59:46] <shoky> Shadda: you can reassign this when calling functions, using .call or .apply
[09:59:55] <Shadda> just found .call, ty
[10:01:38] <wesleyh> is there any plugin that allows me to "record" my clicks, mouse movements and text inputs, and then save that to play back to a user in the same interface?
[10:01:44] <jop008> Is this also suitable for mobile? https://github.com/markmalek/Fixed-Header-Table
[10:06:50] <mentoc> Does javascript support a regex that does the inverse of a character class... i.e.: a.match(/[^0-9]/) .. ?
[10:07:08] <aro_> how do i select an element by the data- attribute?
[10:07:57] <mentoc> answer my own question with jsfiddle
[10:07:58] <Eviltwin> ?tias @ mentoc
[10:07:58] <b-ot> mentoc: Try It And See
[10:07:59] <bot-t> mentoc, Try It And See
[10:08:13] <mentoc> yeah, thanks. I did it on jsfiddle.net
[10:09:35] <JordiGH> Hey, so I'm trying to do something that may sound a bit weird. I want to have the user click on a button, load some json into an iframe, and when that's finished loading, format the json inside that iframe to display the actual data I want.
[10:09:58] <JordiGH> For reasons that are too embarrassing to discuss here, the part where you click, and get an iframe with json inside it can't change.
[10:10:21] <worstadmin> If I .get something that does a 302 redirect should I expect data to be returned to my success callback?
[10:10:36] <Nectarini> Why can I not change the backgroundcolor back
[10:10:36] <Nectarini> http://jsfiddle.net/crWPZ/1/
[10:10:41] <JordiGH> So, is there some sort of load event I can hook into the iframe and then stick a callback into that that reformats my json?
[10:10:54] <JordiGH> Oh, and this callback needs to know which button I clicked to display that iframe.
[10:11:11] <Eviltwin> worstadmin: You should expect the result of fetching the redirect, assuming it doesn't violate the same-origin policy
[10:11:22] <mentoc> JordiGH: it's possible if you have server side scripts that can assist you in transfering data
[10:12:18] <JordiGH> mentoc: What do you mean? What kind of server side scripts? I can't change anything server side either, but I'm curious to know what you have in mind.
[10:13:29] <mentoc> JordiGH: setup an ajax call on both pages. the originating page, and the iframe. it will poll the server every so often. the server will respond with json or not
[10:13:32] <Eviltwin> Nectarini: Spelling it right helps: http://jsfiddle.net/crWPZ/5/
[10:14:03] <mentoc> JordiGH: although this can probably be doen without the server code
[10:14:04] <JordiGH> mentoc: Hmm... that might make sense.
[10:14:09] <jedimind> Nectarini http://jsfiddle.net/crWPZ/6/
[10:14:12] <jedimind> also dont msg people without asking.
[10:14:14] <jedimind> thats fucking annoying
[10:14:36] <wcwrel> chill out dude
[10:15:00] <Eviltwin> Nectarini: And if you're going to use .queue(), please be sure to call the next() callback in the right place: http://jsfiddle.net/crWPZ/7/
[10:15:32] <hsolatges> Hi there.
[10:17:42] <hsolatges> Do anybody help me with my code ? I'm stuck... http://jsfiddle.net/hsolatges/c8YVH/ Can't get my graph plot after editing the data (dt table)
[10:17:50] <Nectarini> jediman sorry, you asked for a jsfiddle so I thought of that as an request for PM
[10:19:48] <jop008> using tables in jqmobile how can I dock / freeze my first header row?
[10:20:16] <donp> why dont you want to msg ppl on mirc? what does it do thats annoying?
[10:20:53] <jop008> and how do youthink that I know that there was a mirc?
[10:21:03] <Phoenixz> When doing a $.ajax, when jQuery fires .done(), if I encounter some error inside the .done handler, could I somehow have jquery execute the .fail() ? I tried throwing an error, but that just got me an uncaught exception..
[10:21:04] <Nectarini> Eviltwin: Thanks
[10:21:40] <nini_> mentoc: how do you think you'd implement it without the server code? (working with JordiGH)
[10:25:10] <shoky> Phoenixz: nope you can't do that afaik. but you can wrap the request in your own $.Deferred if you want and fail that
[10:26:17] <jop008> is there a separte jqmobile channel?
[10:26:42] <jgornick> Hey guys, looking for some insight to why performance of sortable (draggable) is so poor in IE8/IE9. My fiddle can be found @ http://jsfiddle.net/jgornick/Przxf/72/
[10:29:50] <darkfrog> $('.components').css('left') <-- when called on a selector with multiple results does a call like this return the value from the first entry?
[10:30:13] <shoky> ?css
[10:30:13] <b-ot> shoky: http://i.imgur.com/Q3cUg29.gif
[10:30:13] <bot-t> .css(propertyName): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[10:30:20] <shoky> darkfrog ^
[10:30:26] <darkfrog> shoky: :) thanks
[10:31:02] <darkfrog> shoky: is there a convenient way to get the value if all matched elements share the same value or null if they do not?
[10:31:21] <darkfrog> ...apart from iterating over it myself that is. :)
[10:32:04] <bluesm> Does  data() function in jQuery just add to the DOM object   myDomObject.data-MyProperty ?
[10:32:16] <darkfrog> bluesm: no
[10:32:29] <darkfrog> bluesm: data will read *from* the DOM object, but not write back
[10:32:57] <darkfrog> bluesm: if you want to update the DOM you should use attr('data-MyProperty', ...) instead
[10:33:00] <jop008> Is there a way to freeze rows in jqmobile tables?
[10:33:17] <jop008> I see some plugins but for desktop only
[10:33:40] <bluesm> darkfrog: Right but then you store string
[10:33:44] <shoky> darkfrog: you gotta iterate.  var val = components.css('left'), allEqual = !components.filter(function() { return $(this).css('left') !== val }).length; allEqual ? val : null
[10:33:58] <bluesm> darkfrog: But I saw people that store the another object  via data("myKey", myObject)
[10:34:19] <skione> hey, I am trying to do a cross domain .load with 2 sites with the same sub domain. I've set the header to allow this and even tried setting document.domain but still can't get the load to work in IE8, any suggestions?
[10:34:51] <darkfrog> bluesm: exactly why it doesn't store back to the DOM
[10:35:13] <darkfrog> bluesm: writing to data allows greater versatility, but you lose the storage in the DOM
[10:35:35] <darkfrog> bluesm: there are very few cases that it really matters to store back to the DOM though.
[10:35:52] <darkfrog> bluesm: why not just use data and leave the DOM be?
[10:36:42] <shoky> bluesm: jquery just adds a property to the DOM object e.g. myDomObject.jQuery238752389778392 and its value is a key into an internal data cache object which stores the actual data
[10:37:28] <JordiGH> mentoc: Yeah, I'm curious too. What did you have in mind that didn't involve touching the server?
[10:38:29] <bluesm> shoky:  What this number means ?
[10:38:43] <bluesm> shoky: Random number ? To eliminate collision ?
[10:39:05] <shoky> bluesm: yeah i think so
[10:39:29] <skione> anyone, cross domain, ie8 pu weeze?
[10:40:22] <shoky> skione i think in IE8 you need to add the xdr transport to jquery https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[10:41:24] <skione> thx shoky, I'll give this a look see
[10:49:04] <haiQt> Hey guys, does anyone know if it's possible to execute a function on *any* error?
[10:49:34] <CWSpear> haiQt, on any JS error?
[10:50:31] <haiQt> Yeah
[10:50:32] <CWSpear> haiQt: window.onerror = function (message, url, line)
[10:50:36] <shoky> window.onerror catches uncaught exceptions i think. haven't used it myself tho, i think it's not considered great practice
[10:50:47] <haiQt> Well, I'm not trying to use it for error handling
[10:51:05] <haiQt> I want to build a small tracker that collects any possible errors that might happen and post them to a service to collect them
[10:51:22] <haiQt> So I can easily see when/if users get errors
[10:52:33] <shoky> sounds fine ;p
[10:53:31] <CWSpear> haiQt, that's what we did. We had a PhoneGap app and we posted errors to a log on our server.
[10:53:36] <CWSpear> using window.onerror
[10:54:39] <haiQt> Cool, thanks!
[10:54:42] <zizzl> Hey guys, in this.. http://jsfiddle.net/xSRtR/ I have code that worked, and I tried to create some functions and call them and now it doesn't work... Can someone tell me what I did wrong.. I promise it will take you 10 seconds, just trying to learn here
[10:55:07] <Gho5t> zizzl: ctrl-z
[10:55:12] <Gho5t> the shit out of it
[10:55:27] <bgy> Hi
[10:56:13] <bgy> I'm doing an $.ajax() request, and use .done().fail() but It enters always in the fail() method while the response is a success (status code 202)
[10:56:20] <bgy> any ideas?
[10:56:21] <zizzl> Gho5t.. I can and I have my old code in.. but I want to create the functions
[10:56:22] <haiQt> zizzl: Your fiddle seems incomplete, I can only see the JS code?
[10:56:54] <zizzl> haiQt, yeah I didn't seem the need for HTML & CSS on it, I have the working jQuery code in there with the non-working on, I thought it would be an easy thing to see
[10:57:04] <zizzl> since I'm just trying to consolidate
[10:57:16] <CWSpear> zizzl, you are passing what is returned by iconFadeIn, when you want to pass iconFadeIn
[10:57:28] <CWSpear> on line 24 and 25, remove the () from the Fade functions
[10:58:13] <Gho5t> yeah you're calling the function instead of passing the reference
[10:59:15] <zizzl> CWSpear, ahh thanks
[10:59:20] <zizzl> I'll have to read up on that
[10:59:31] <zizzl> as I don't quite get when to use the () and not
[10:59:57] <Gho5t> adding the () immediately invokes it
[11:00:27] <CWSpear> zizzl, yeah, by invoking the function, you are passing to the mouseenter handler what's returned by that function (which is undefined in your example)
[11:00:45] <CWSpear> so obviously passing undefined doesn't do anything! Instead, you want to pass the function
[11:02:57] <Zesty> are there any main gotchas to be aware of with jquery and IE7? im not using any animation. the only thing i have found so far is that ajax doesnt work, and I had to use JSONP which seems really ghetto :/
[11:04:57] <BillCriswell> Zesty: You shouldn't have to use jsonp unless you're getting data from a remote resource
[11:05:07] <Zesty> its across subdomains
[11:05:22] <haiQt> CWSpear: it seems that the message passed to the window.onerror function isn't the one I get in my console -- my console says 'Uncaught TypeError: Object #<Object> has no method 'push' while the message passed to the window.onerror function just says 'Script error.'
[11:05:32] <Zesty> i need to send data, but i dont care about the response
[11:07:22] <igcewieling1> *grumble*  "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" is going to drive me insane.
[11:07:47] <CWSpear> haiQt, not really sure. it worked for us
[11:09:01] <Zesty> BillCriswell: is that what you mean?
[11:12:25] <BillCriswell> Zesty: subdomains would have the same restrictions.
[11:12:59] <BillCriswell> Unless you've got CORS set up the right way.. should have asked that first.
[11:13:02] <BillCriswell> Long day, sorry
[11:13:16] <bgy> any ideas why my Ajax deferred promise is always failing() while the statusText is OK ?
[11:13:22] <bgy> (and seems successful)
[11:13:35] <shoky> bgy: is it a json request? check the arguments to .fail callback, check if the response is valid
[11:13:50] <bgy> shoky, yeah it is a json request/response
[11:14:13] <shoky> could be a json parse error
[11:14:13] <bgy> statusText: "OK", status: 200
[11:14:26] <bgy> mmm it may be there are no body to response
[11:14:28] <shoky> what's the actual response
[11:14:31] <shoky> ah
[11:14:31] <bgy> it is considered wrong?
[11:14:57] <bgy> actually, I used a 202 to indicate "Accepted request" but it failed, so I tried with a more standard response code
[11:15:01] <bgy> and it's the same
[11:15:07] <bgy> responseText: ""
[11:15:14] <shoky> could be. this behaviour was just changed a bit in the last versions iirc
[11:15:15] <bgy> (from chrome console)
[11:15:19] <bgy> mm ok
[11:15:31] <bgy> I'll add a dummy empty object to check
[11:16:25] <bgy> shoky, you got it, responding a {} seems to work
[11:17:10] <bgy> thanks!
[11:19:44] <thaifood> hi, Anyone know an input mask that will let me limit input to valid v4IP addresses ?
[11:20:03] <thaifood> I'm looking at this one but don't see a way:  http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/
[11:20:22] <jop008> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'not' of undefined ??
[11:20:47] <Gho5t> null reference brah
[11:21:03] <thaifood> nvm i think i found one
[11:22:48] <jop008> is it mandatory to have a thead in your table?
[11:23:09] <Gho5t> no it's put there implicitly anyways
[11:32:13] <fartface> Say that I have an XML document, is there an easy way to traverse it to find each element contained within that contains text?
[11:32:39] <eddiemonge> ?contains @ fartface
[11:32:40] <bot-t> fartface, :contains(text): Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[11:32:41] <jedimind> i dont want to, i think its entirely impossible that you have an XML document, and i will say no such thing
[11:34:11] <fartface> I'm not looking for specific text, just that $(this).text().length > 0.  Still :contains()?
[11:35:38] <fartface> Essentially I have an XML tree, I need to traverse that.  For each element that contains a text value, I need to create a variable that holds its tag name, and then the tag name of each of its parents up to the root node in an array.
[11:35:49] <fartface> If that makes sense.
[11:36:23] <thaifood> Can anyone tell me  how to use this IP mask control ?  http://code.google.com/p/jquery-input-ip-address-control/
[11:36:44] <thaifood> i got the JS file and loaded it but don't see how to create the mask.
[11:36:45] <mentoc_> $(function(){ $('.ipv4').ipAddress(); $('.ipv6').ipAddress({v:6});
[11:36:45] <mentoc_> });
[11:36:58] <thaifood> does that go in my   $(document).ready(function() {
[11:37:13] <Gho5t> yep
[11:37:13] <mentoc_> quite possibly
[11:37:26] <thaifood> and i just add the class  .ipv4 to my input boxes ?
[11:38:40] <thaifood> seems to work,  thanks !!!
[11:40:06] <thaifood> hmm, doesn't seem to like jquery  2  $.browser is undefined
[11:40:18] <thaifood> seems to work though
[11:40:50] <fartface> Like, if I use $record.text(), it returns all of the text contained within each node, but is there a way that I can capture which node that text is coming from?
[11:41:33] <thaifood> it's this if($.browser.webkit || $.browser.msie) {
[11:42:02] <thaifood> is there a jquery 2 way to do the same thing ?
[11:42:28] <snover> yeah: stop it
[11:42:46] <snover> target features, not browsers
[11:42:48] <thaifood> it's in the source here  http://code.google.com/p/jquery-input-ip-address-control/
[11:42:53] <thaifood> line 127
[11:43:23] <thaifood> i didn't write, it i'm just looking for a simple fix if possible
[11:43:48] <Anniepoo> Can anybody recommend a learning path for me - I want to go from knowing little/nothing about jquery to being fairly fluent in jquery an jqueryui  ?
[11:44:15] <snover> Anniepoo: learn javascript first
[11:44:36] <alexr2> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
[11:44:42] <Anniepoo> sounds reasonable
[11:45:01] <thaifood> Anniepoo,  google  "eloquent javascript"
[11:45:07] <thaifood> it's all interactive
[11:45:25] <Anniepoo> cool
[11:46:37] <thaifood> snover, can you suggest a workaround for line 128 please ?  http://fpaste.org/24078/39556713/
[11:47:12] <snover> delete it
[11:47:30] <thaifood> including the   return entryNoCharacter(e);  and } lines ?
[11:47:38] <snover> maybe!
[11:48:11] <thaifood> god help me :-)
[12:00:54] <alexr2> anyone know of a way to stringify/de-stringify an object that will persist functions?
[12:03:22] <happyg0pher> not sure, maybe JSON can help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10392293/stringify-javascript-object-with-circular-reference
[12:04:38] <alexr2> json drops functions unfortunately
[12:05:58] <jwmann> I have a jquery script that wait for an on('click') to perform actions; Would anyone know why the first click doesn't do anything after a fresh page load?
[12:08:12] <blindMoe> jwmann: best to put your code in a jsfiddle so we can see what you are doing
[12:08:31] <p3lim> I've successfully overridden chrome's ctrl+s shortcut, but if I apply the same logic to ctrl+n (new page) it does't work
[12:11:39] <p3lim> This is what I use: http://paste.p3lim.net/wnuJMs
[12:12:19] <dcherman> p3lim: that's a terrible user experience, don't override well-known browser keyboard shortcuts.  to answer your question, you can't prevent all shortcuts, only some of them.
[12:13:37] <p3lim> Yeah, I'm considering using shift instead of ctrl
[12:13:58] <jwmann> blindMoe: Thing is, it only happens when it's on the website. Putting in in jsFiddle, the problem disappears. I don't know what else could be the problem.
[12:14:31] <jwmann> If you like to see the code anyway, it's here: http://jsfiddle.net/FG23B/
[12:14:34] <blindMoe> is it wrapped in a $(document).ready()   ?    also is it using an ID to identify the element?
[12:15:02] <blindMoe> hrmm seems like it should be fine
[12:15:40] <jwmann> blindMoe: Yea, it's really weird...
[12:30:30] <darkfrog> you can use selector.add(other) to add an element...how do you explicitly remove an item from a selector?
[12:36:03] <Jon47> darkfrog: .sub i believe, why not search the documentation instead of asking here..
[12:36:27] <darkfrog> Jon47: the documentation is often ambiguous
[12:36:52] <Jon47> i think you'll find that strangers on irc can also be ambiguous
[12:37:42] <darkfrog> Jon47: though true, I find it often easier to get a clear answer when I can explain the context....Google doesn't care so much about context...it's a jerk like that.
[12:43:08] <mentoc_> Is jquery's "each" faster than a classic for loop?
[12:44:09] <eddiemonge> mentoc_: lol
[12:44:19] <thinkt4nk> as a general rule of thumb, any layer of abstraction will add overhead to a process
[12:44:29] <thinkt4nk> so, no
[12:44:43] <JordiGH> But how much overlay?
[12:44:44] <thinkt4nk> well, in optimal conditions, perhaps
[12:46:56] <thinkt4nk> mentoc_ you should compare your specific implementations here http://jsperf.com/
[12:47:14] <fartface> Can anyone help me with this problem?  http://pastebin.com/aghyiy4e

[12:47:46] <bot-t> mentoc_, http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jsperf.com+jquery.each+vs+for+loop
[12:49:01] <eddiemonge> fartface: why dont you read the whole thing into json and just work with that. so much prettier than json
[12:50:05] <fartface> Because the record has to stay in XML.
[12:50:14] <fartface> Here's a better pastebin with my existing code: http://pastebin.com/74tsZvky
[12:50:37] <fartface> It works with fields which have a parent of "record", but not with any further nested fields.
[12:51:30] <fartface> eddiemonge: For a more definitive "why", it's boss requirements.
[12:51:43] <eddiemonge> so it has to stay in xml but become something else?
[12:52:41] <fartface> The underlying record has to be accessible as XML (future enhancements, ie. using SOAP), but for right now, the data has to be able to be submitted using an HTML form, and the only way that the underlying system will accept it is in the field$1$1$1 format
[12:56:50] <fartface> Any ideas?

[13:10:07] <Mr_Grim> when rendering html dynamically, how do I tell jquery mobile to repaint specific widgets, content, etc inside a specific div container?
[13:10:33] <arschmitz> Mr_Grim: trigger create on the container
[13:10:56] <arschmitz> it will enhance any widgets withen the container
[13:18:08] <Mr_Grim> $('#alert_container').trigger('create'); ?
[13:21:23] <oojacoboo> anyone seen issues where IE9 removes/hides input elements with jq 1.9+ ?
[13:21:59] <oojacoboo> Mr_Grim: huh?
[13:22:47] <oojacoboo> $("#alert_conatiner").append("<div>my html</div>");
[13:29:42] <mentoc> I would imagine that $.each would be slower than a for(...) simply because in a for you don't call a function every iteration like you would in $.each
[13:32:44] <oojacoboo> mentoc: a for loop is def faster
[13:32:56] <oojacoboo> $.each is actually not that fast last I recall

[13:34:47] <ezrafree> can anyone tell me what I may be doing wrong here: http://pastium.org/view/bac39089b5f563f8c251b41e833df8c4
[13:35:18] <ezrafree> it deletes the item okay, so the ajax post call to the deletefile.php is working properly, but it does not remove() the file from the list
[13:35:55] <ezrafree> i have also tried hide() instead of remove()
[13:36:16] <ezrafree> and yet the same code without the ajax post works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/MuCNA/
[13:36:55] <diminoten> hey what am I doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/mHVTY/2/
[13:37:16] <diminoten> trying to serialize form data and... well right now just alert it
[13:37:41] <BillCriswell> diminoten: You need names on the inputs.
[13:38:04] <diminoten> whew okay
[13:39:10] <BillCriswell> ezrafree: this changed inside of $.post
[13:39:49] <BillCriswell> ezrafree: You'd need to do like var $button = $(this); then del_id = $button.parent().prop('id'); then in the post you can use $button freely.
[13:40:29] <ezrafree> BillCriswell: ahhh thanks
[13:41:13] <BillCriswell> ezrafree: Welcome.
[13:43:27] <markfurrow> exit
[13:43:29] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: prop('id')?
[13:43:35] <eddiemonge> markfurrow: rejected
[13:44:21] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: yes, you use prop for id
[13:44:36] <oojacoboo> or attr
[13:44:37] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: Too lazy to look up if it's "right" or not. I'd probably use .attr('id') if it was my codes.
[13:44:37] <eddiemonge> id is an attribute
[13:44:51] <oojacoboo> it's both technically
[13:44:54] <eddiemonge> if it was my code, id do $('sel')[0].id
[13:45:14] <oojacoboo> eddiemonge: heh, don't you think that's a prop?
[13:45:18] <oojacoboo> .id ...
[13:45:34] <eddiemonge> no. to me props are things that change. attr are static
[13:45:39] <oojacoboo> lol
[13:45:45] <oojacoboo> properties are properties of the object
[13:45:46] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: What would you do with that extra .000000000002144ish of a second?
[13:45:51] <oojacoboo> what you just did is a property
[13:46:11] <eddiemonge> nope. its an attribute
[13:46:36] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: I change classes all the time.
[13:46:52] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: id save it for later and then when i had 1 extra second, id take a nap
[13:47:00] <BillCriswell> eddiemonge: Good plan.
[13:47:37] <paul_uk> hey, has anyone seen a message popup (alert, confirmation, etc) skinned to android.  i've got one for IOS.
[13:48:09] <BillCriswell> http://jsperf.com/this-attr-id-vs-this-prop-id that's interesting.
[13:50:22] <eddiemonge> BillCriswell: i dislike that test becaues it changes when google updates jquery so it can be completely wrong depending on the when someone tested it
[13:52:20] <BillCriswell> http://jsfiddle.net/2BqDP/ quick one i set up.. prop() seems quicker?
[13:52:52] <BillCriswell> Splitting hairs, still
[13:54:10] <eddiemonge> http://jsperf.com/this-attr-id-vs-this-prop-id/2
[13:55:29] <BillCriswell> $(elem)[0].id is what I tested with. Since I it was already a jquery object haha
[13:59:05] <eddiemonge> splitting hairs. the only real difference is this case: http://jsfiddle.net/2BqDP/1/
[14:00:39] <BillCriswell> True.
[14:16:42] <veQue> I have a question. I could try to pick the room that best suits it but I'd have to think about the winner. Anyways I like a mobile version of a website better than the non-mobile because the mobile ver. stays away from adobe flash. I am reading the urls from both my mobile device and it was slightly different than the pc ver. of the site. so i entered the address . but I dont' get the mobile site.
[14:16:59] <veQue> my question is how do I get to the mobile ver. of a site i like.?
[14:17:50] <jtal> any known jquery vs. ie10 compatability mode problems ?
[14:18:37] <BillCriswell> veQue: You can spoof your UA
[14:18:57] <veQue> k thanks i'll look into that
[14:19:33] <BillCriswell> veQue: You in Chrome? If so you can open the developers console and click the cog, then click "Overrides" and check the "User Agent" box and choose an iphone or something.
[14:20:13] <veQue> no, ff
[14:20:25] <veQue> i just installed an addon
[14:20:31] <BillCriswell> Ok cool
[14:27:20] <BillCriswell> Ugh, entities
[14:30:23] <veQue> well it worked. but not doing what I hoped it would do
[14:31:06] <veQue> was hoping that on html5 elements I would be able to tab to things like podcasts without using the mouse
[14:32:03] <eddiemonge> jtal: thats a vague question
[14:32:04] <veQue> well i am spoofing with an iphone 3
[14:32:08] <veQue> let me try ipad
[14:32:36] <jtal> I didnt think so
[14:33:00] <eddiemonge> jtal: it is. are you having a specific problem?
[14:34:05] <jtal> no, I dont know anything about IE and am used to a captive audience that had to use specific browsers.  now a little tool I wrote was deployed and early reports are that it doesnt work and has no errors in console for IE 10 compatability view
[14:34:38] <jtal> I'm trying to install IE 10 on two different windows machines, one wants to do an update for the next hour, the other is crashing... why anyone uses this shi...stuff is beyone me
[14:41:08] <veQue> so just wondering when html5 becomes more mainstream there will be a way to navigate through a whole content filled webpage with keyboard only right?
[14:41:32] <BillCriswell> 'Black​ Fram​e'.indexOf('Frame') was a fun one
[14:45:59] <jackw411> hey guys I'm trying to figure out the best way to go about tablets -> i have various inputs literred around a page, what would be the best method of moving these into view when a keyboard comes up on a tablet to type into it?
[14:55:46] <sunbeam> how can i access an element by their href
[14:56:02] <fartface> $('[href=YOUR_HREF]');
[14:57:09] <sunbeam> thanks
[14:57:39] <sunbeam> another question
[14:59:02] <sunbeam> data-maphilight='{"stroke": false,"fillColor":"000000","fillOpacity":0.4}' how can i add this to an element?
[15:06:21] <eddiemonge> ?data @ sunbeam
[15:06:22] <bot-t> sunbeam, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[15:06:38] <eddiemonge> its almost like you arent even trying
[15:07:37] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: but how do i add maphilight ?
[15:07:45] <sunbeam> i mean how does jquery know its this data-* value
[15:07:51] <sunbeam> data-* key i mean
[15:08:36] <eddiemonge> did you read that page?
[15:11:24] <sunbeam> sorry it works
[15:13:51] <jtal> ok, got IE10 now... problem appears to be appending options to a select box
[15:14:02] <jtal> it works in 8,9,10 but not 10 compatiblity view
[15:14:15] <sunbeam> another question, say i have 2 links, and i want both links to be highlighted always when i hover over 1 of the 2
[15:14:32] <sunbeam> how can i add a mouseover here and avoid that both links get mouseoverred again and again
[15:14:38] <jtal> $("select#myThing").append("<option>.....")
[15:17:57] <grafi> sunbeam that sounds like a job for css oô
[15:19:17] <sunbeam> grafi: no, as i need to call a js function
[15:19:20] <sunbeam> on the mouseover
[15:19:55] <grafi> okidoki
[15:20:09] <sunbeam> any idea how i can do thiso?
[15:20:11] <sunbeam> this
[15:20:12] <jtal> what is the best way to add an option to select box?
[15:20:35] <jtal> I'm just appending <option> as strings but ie 10 comptability view is not working
[15:26:49] <anew> i have an href and i'm trying to save the anchor text into a variable when the href is clicked
[15:26:53] <anew> i cant figure out how to do it
[15:27:05] <inthl> I am using http://code.google.com/p/jqueryrotate/wiki/Documentation to rotate an image whenever one clicks on a div, which slides down then. That div uses slideToggle and the image is being rotated. Works great. But when I click that div again it slides up (as it should) but the image does not rotate back. Now how could one do that, 1. to slide the div down and rotate the image and 2. slide that div up and rotate that image back?
[15:27:21] <mordof> anew: $(this).text()
[15:27:46] <grafi> jtal appending like that seems to be working fine for me with ie10 in compat mode
[15:27:54] <anew> mordof i tried this so far http://pastebin.com/KsuUL7ME
[15:27:56] <anew> but not working
[15:28:09] <anew> dont i need to use .click() ?
[15:28:31] <mordof> anew: oh, click handlers don't return data like that - even if you put a return on it (which you haven't)
[15:28:41] <anew> hmmm i see
[15:28:55] <anew> so when i click the link, how can i save the text ? just with .text() ?
[15:29:06] <mordof> anew: you'll need to put the click handler outside the object, and then put the form_data.city = $(this).attr('href'); inside the click handler
[15:29:35] <anew> ah
[15:29:38] <anew> ok let me try that
[15:29:39] <anew> thx
[15:29:42] * mordof nods
[15:30:24] <sunbeam> how can i trigger that always both a's with a certain class get highlighted when i mouseover over one?
[15:30:35] <sunbeam> and the highlight is a js function, nothing css
[15:30:54] <grafi> have you tried .mouseover?
[15:31:03] <eddiemonge> sunbeam learn.jquery.com
[15:31:20] <mordof> sunbeam: also, how would you do that without css?
[15:32:12] <sunbeam> grafi: when i use .mouseover it starts an endless loop
[15:32:14] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: and why would you want no css? if it were me id do all css with no js
[15:32:33] <grafi> so show some code sunbeam
[15:32:45] <mordof> except you can't get that behavior in *entirely* css unfortunately
[15:34:02] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: i need to init a function
[15:34:03] <sunbeam> ok
[15:34:30] <sunbeam> $('.part-1, .part-2').mouseover(function(e) { $('.part-1, .part-2').mouseover(); });
[15:34:35] <sunbeam> actually this is what i need to do
[15:34:54] <grafi> ehm
[15:34:55] <grafi> oô
[15:34:55] <eddiemonge> mordof: depending on the structure you could
[15:35:37] <sunbeam> grafi: however this will trigger mouseover not one time for both
[15:37:29] <grafi> thats because you completely ignore what element the mouseover is triggered on
[15:38:02] <sunbeam> grafi: correct
[15:38:06] <sunbeam> how can i best find this
[15:39:35] <umf_gg> when you scroll down the nav changes/docks to top, anyone know what this is called exactly? http://electricdaisycarnival.com/
[15:40:52] <mordof> umf_gg: all that is doing is keeping track of the scrollTop, and when it's higher than a certain value, is changing the position of a position: fixed; element at the top of the page
[15:41:07] <umf_gg> any idea what you would refer to this menu ass?
[15:41:18] <umf_gg> ex: sticky top
[15:41:45] <mordof> no idea.. but i told you pretty much everything you need to know for coding it..
[15:41:49] <mordof> it's very simple
[15:42:05] <mordof> element position: fixed; - use css to position it negatively at the top
[15:42:08] <grafi> sunbeam http://jsfiddle.net/XgTE2/
[15:42:39] <mordof> umf_gg: then watch the scroll event of the window, check the value, if it's larger than x amount,  modify the css of the position fixed element to come into view
[15:43:14] <umf_gg> lol
[15:43:27] <umf_gg> I understand how it works just writing a spec for a new site wasnt sure what to refer to it as
[15:43:52] <mordof> ah
[15:45:51] <mordof> yeah i can't find what it would be referred to as in google
[15:47:40] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/VKqRz/ mordof this is what i have, i cant get 'google' into the city variable
[15:47:56] <mordof> does triggerHandler return anything from the function that the event handler ran?
[15:48:11] <anew> r u talking to me ?
[15:48:17] <mordof> no
[15:48:26] <mordof> anew: because the attr href is "#"
[15:48:34] <mordof> anew: .text() is for the text of an element
[15:48:42] <anew> i'm  amoron
[15:48:53] <mordof> besides, you need to define form_data outside of the handler event
[15:48:59] <mordof> or your scope / garbage collection will have issues
[15:49:05] <anew> how do u mean
[15:49:17] <anew> http://jsfiddle.net/VKqRz/1/
[15:49:18] <anew> like this ?
[15:49:50] <mordof> anew: you should probably read this:  http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/01/what-you-need-to-know-about-javascript-scope/
[15:50:06] <mordof> anew: learn a bit of javascript
[15:50:24] <mordof> er
[15:50:30] <mordof> ok so that goes far too indepth later on in the article..
[15:50:36] <anew> how am i supposed to definie it ouside click() if it doesnt exist until someone clicks
[15:51:20] <mordof> quite easily: http://jsfiddle.net/VKqRz/2/
[15:51:49] <mordof> anew: you can also initialize it with null.. still, you should learn some javascript when you can
[15:52:11] <anew> thanks
[15:52:12] <mordof> anew: those are fundamental concepts of the language you're trying to work with
[15:52:17] <retran> why learn javascript if i'm wanting to use jquery?? :o)
[15:52:22] <mordof> because you're using javascript
[15:52:29] <mordof> jquery is a library built on javascript
[15:52:31] <sunbeam> grafi: correct thanks ,but if i do say var active_class = $(this).attr("class"); if(active_class == "part-1") { $(".part-2).mouseover() } );
[15:52:35] <sunbeam> grafi: that's the idea right?
[15:52:40] <mordof> retran: please tell me that was sarcasm
[15:52:50] <retran> mayyyyybe
[15:52:54] <mordof> .....
[15:53:05] <grafi> i dont really see what you are trying to accomplish sunbeam oô
[15:53:12] <retran> ask the clown face if it was :o)
[15:53:38] <mordof> retran: i had to ask - because too many people have that exact mindset
[15:53:46] <mordof> = my biggest and main problem with the existence of jquery
[15:53:51] <retran> that seems depressing
[15:53:55] <mordof> it is
[15:54:09] <mordof> and it's frustrating - but jquery encourages that for beginners
[15:54:14] <grafi> poor mordof
[15:54:23] <mordof> lol
[15:54:33] <anew> hodor
[15:54:43] <rupee> modor
[15:54:47] <grafi> sshhh hodor, no more hodoring!
[15:54:47] <sunbeam> grafi: initiate a mouseover on both
[15:54:54] <anew> shouldnt i be able to console.log(form_data) now and see
[15:54:59] <anew> mordof sounds like hodor
[15:55:13] <mordof> sunbeam: you only need to watch for a mouseover on either, and apply the css to highlight on both
[15:55:48] <mordof> sunbeam: $("ele1, ele2").mouseover(function(){  $("ele1, ele2").css('background-color', 'red'); })
[15:56:18] <grafi> still why would you ever want to do such a thing
[15:56:27] <mordof> heh, exactly
[15:56:28] <grafi> everything lights up red
[15:56:28] <mordof> oh well
[15:56:43] <grafi> confusing the user :D
[15:57:05] <mordof> grafi: a hierarchical maze of awesomeness!! :D
[15:57:16] <grafi> its lacking sound
[15:57:17] <grafi> !
[15:57:22] <mordof> and animated gifs
[15:57:26] <grafi> hm
[15:57:36] <grafi> and unicorns!
[15:57:41] <mordof> throw some marquees in there and we've got a party!
[15:58:07] <grafi> that reminds me of the time i used cornify to showcase a xss vulnerability
[15:58:11] <grafi> it was awesome
[15:58:13] <mordof> lol
[15:59:31] <grafi> sadly it was fixed quickly ^^
[16:01:58] <andrewSC> why is it not a good idea to uriencode the id value attribute on an element?
[16:02:02] <jtal> grafi: thanks for checking for me, not sure why it doesnt work for me
[16:02:21] <grafi> do you have your code online somewhere to check it directly?
[16:02:23] <boytoy> shoky: bad link? sorry which one?
[16:02:28] <mordof> andrewSC: if you're applying a uriencoded id to an element - it'll likely be invalid
[16:02:47] <mordof> andrewSC: id's can't support all characters that show up in encoded strings
[16:02:50] <andrewSC> mordof: https://gist.github.com/andrewSC/9b2849c3cef3ee8d95fb
[16:02:58] <andrewSC> you are correct about the invalid part
[16:03:02] <jtal> lemme get it
[16:03:02] <andrewSC> now what to do about it...
[16:03:07] <mordof> andrewSC: don't do it
[16:03:11] <andrewSC> the data i'm working with from this company is totally screwed
[16:03:14] <mordof> andrewSC: it's invalid HTML, CSS, etc
[16:03:22] <mordof> oh - you have no choice? lol
[16:03:40] <andrewSC> yeah this is miserable
[16:03:50] <mordof> hm
[16:03:51] <mordof> 1 sec
[16:03:58] <andrewSC> and it's "really" the only identifiable/unique piece of info to each of the objects
[16:04:20] <grafi> you can have spaces in ids?
[16:04:21] <grafi> oô
[16:04:33] <jtal> http://pastie.org/8126242
[16:04:40] <andrewSC> grafi: yes, this company is horrible about data
[16:04:46] <jtal> hm maybe its bad to do append() in a each callback
[16:05:12] <andrewSC> I *could* sanitize it client side and just store the sanitized version as an attribute
[16:05:21] <mordof> grafi: i don't think it's valid though
[16:05:51] <jtal> the first append() works by the way
[16:06:07] <jtal> not the ones in the loop even though the data is good
[16:06:29] <Tomashe> anyone worked with pjax plugin?
[16:06:34] <andrewSC> mordof: I'm just gonna do that, I'm tired of dealing with their crap data
[16:06:42] <mordof> andrewSC: yeah you might have to go through and clean things up and use data- attributes or something
[16:06:53] <mordof> andrewSC: i can't think of a way to select that properly
[16:07:10] <retran> is there a cool syntax to add to multiple events
[16:07:21] <andrewSC> mordof: yeah it's not worth the effort. If this company was not as careless I'd care more but they're pretty bad
[16:07:27] <grafi> cant i have multiple ids on one element then?
[16:07:41] <grafi> because space in class="" makes two classes oô
[16:07:52] <sunbeam> mordof: that's not possible because i need to trigger another mouseover
[16:08:06] <mordof> grafi: id's are meant to be unique for a page, which means that there's really not much point at all in having more than one id. making it unlikely that multiple id's on one element is valid
[16:08:43] <mordof> sunbeam: i seriously question why you'd need to have your logic that way
[16:10:47] <sunbeam> mordof: why not
[16:10:50] <eddiemonge> retran: .on('click change focus', function() {}
[16:11:05] <mordof> sunbeam: because in most cases that's considered confusing, and is not a good idea in general
[16:11:49] <mordof> sunbeam: often times logic issues like this can also indicate that you're approaching a problem the wrong way
[16:12:18] <mordof> for instance if you're trying to group an image and an anchor to both hover, it's a structural issue that you need to deal with.. not make up for it by using javascript
[16:12:23] <grafi> jtal funnily enough that doesnt work for me in ie10 :D im just not sure why
[16:12:50] <jtal> about to crack this case wide open
[16:13:56] <sunbeam> ehm maybe another way
[16:14:06] <sunbeam> how can i check the nth instance this is
[16:14:12] <sunbeam> for example <a> in a <div>
[16:14:25] <mordof> sunbeam: if you explain what it is you're actually trying to do, and not how you're trying to solve it, i can help you figure it out better
[16:14:45] <jtal> grafi: I think its the single quotes
[16:15:05] <grafi> hm
[16:15:06] <grafi> maybe
[16:15:14] <grafi> does it work now for you?
[16:15:15] <grafi> :p
[16:15:40] <jtal> yes but I made several cahnges, trying to isolate it now
[16:15:55] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: again, i think you should go through learn.jquery.com or even better, try.jquery.com. you dont seem to know the basics
[16:16:12] <jtal> *enhance*  ...  *enhance*
[16:16:43] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: what do i don't know
[16:16:43] <jtal> hm yup works without those single quotes
[16:17:45] <jtal> ohhh wait...I
[16:17:49] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: youve asked a lot of basic questions that you could have learned the answer to if you followed along the tutorials
[16:19:17] <jtal> haha it didnt work, I had put in a line to force compatibilty mode to be turned off
[16:19:29] <grafi> cool^^
[16:21:01] <grafi> hm
[16:21:07] <grafi> works for me now
[16:21:13] <grafi> not sure why :o
[16:21:14] <jtal> what'd you do?
[16:21:25] <grafi> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/Dqgpx does that work for you? oô
[16:21:34] <retran> thanks eddiemonge
[16:22:13] <jtal> yuuup
[16:22:33] <grafi> hm
[16:22:35] <jtal> what the what
[16:23:18] <jtal> was that not working for you before?
[16:23:23] <boytoy> shoky: ah sorry yeh
[16:23:28] <grafi> not on my first try
[16:23:37] <grafi> but now it does
[16:23:40] <grafi> ^^
[16:23:52] <grafi> ie10 still sucks
[16:23:53] <grafi> :P
[16:24:26] <jtal> fo real
[16:24:28] <CWSpear> grafi still does suck
[16:24:30] <Tomashe> anyone have real experiance with pjax, i have some issue i would like to share
[16:24:45] <CWSpear> I had an issue the other day where it was adding width and height attrs to images I was adding to the DOM via jQuery
[16:24:48] <grafi> nice try ie10 spokesperson
[16:24:49] <CWSpear> only in IE10
[16:25:22] <CWSpear> and it was random values, too… like no where near the actual size or ratio of the image or any elements on the page
[16:25:30] <eddiemonge> Tomashe: jquery version?
[16:25:36] <jtal> CWSPear I'm doing this from now on
[16:25:37] <jtal> <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge" />
[16:25:43] <grafi> its called surprise unicorn mode CWSpear
[16:25:46] <jtal> until something bad happens
[16:26:09] <Pavlov> hrm
[16:26:32] <CWSpear> I had that, jtal. Didn't seem to matter. I just .remoteAttr('height width') before inserting into the DOM and it worked find
[16:26:34] <CWSpear> fine*
[16:26:35] <retran> is IE10 beta
[16:26:40] <grafi> and that forces ie out of compat mode jtal?
[16:26:53] <CWSpear> and removes the broken page icon
[16:27:01] <jtal> grafi: yeah it says highest mode that will work
[16:27:05] <CWSpear> you can set it as a header, too, like in your .htaccess
[16:27:06] <jtal> I dont know how ms decides that
[16:27:11] <grafi> ^^
[16:27:21] <grafi> always render as if ie6
[16:27:23] <grafi> *cough*
[16:27:26] <jtal> heh
[16:27:32] <grafi> the fact that they out things like that in ...
[16:27:37] <grafi> *put
[16:27:40] <CWSpear> what about <input type="password"> in IE10?
[16:27:59] <sunbeam> how to check whether a .mouseover is trigger by a real mouseover, or by another function calling .mouseover() ?
[16:28:03] <jtal> http://www.ie6countdown.com/
[16:28:09] <jtal> cant believe so many people still use it
[16:28:14] <grafi> i always render white pages for everybody that tries to surf the site via IE
[16:28:15] <grafi> :D
[16:28:21] <jtal> must be forced by some device or employer
[16:28:39] <CWSpear> I still haven't made up my mind about it. I am actually okay with the concept in some situations, but I don't like that it does it in every situation and that it is super buggy
[16:28:45] <CWSpear> IE10 passwords, that is
[16:29:23] <grafi> well as you can see on the map its mostly china, god knows why they like to torture themselves
[16:29:43] <CWSpear> wanna see something cool?
[16:29:58] <grafi> does it involve unicorns?
[16:29:59] <jtal> yes
[16:30:08] <sunbeam> how to check whether a .mouseover is trigger by a real mouseover, or by another function calling .mouseover() ?
[16:30:19] <sunbeam> i mean detecting is a mouseover is done manually
[16:30:25] <CWSpear> http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version_partially_combined-CN-monthly-201206-201306
[16:30:31] <Kre10s> I've got a form, and i have bound a submit event handler. $myform.submit(function (e) { ... }); the form contains multiple submit buttons. how can i tell which one was clicked?
[16:30:31] <jtal> sunbeam is this still the highlighting links thing?
[16:30:33] <grafi> see sunbeam, and thats not even where your problems start ...
[16:30:44] <grafi> yes it is jtal
[16:31:21] <CWSpear> so notice a couple interesting anomalies in that graph of China's browser usage and then read http://www.techinasia.com/360-safe-browser-malware/
[16:31:49] <sunbeam> jtal: yes
[16:32:07] <sunbeam> grafi: then just explain what I am doing wrong
[16:32:10] <sunbeam> I don't get it
[16:33:20] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: http://jsfiddle.net/w72h4/ that should be all you need to figure it out
[16:33:57] <eddiemonge> Kre10s: why do you have multiple submit buttons?
[16:34:21] <Kre10s> add to cart/ add to cat & continue shopping
[16:35:12] <grafi> sunbeam the thing is it sounds to me like you shouldnt be doing what you are trying to do in the first place and that gets you in trouble
[16:35:18] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: of course I undeerstand that but i don't see what it has to do with my issue
[16:35:31] <sunbeam> grafi: ok cool what should I do then?
[16:35:53] <jtal> sunbeam: we're dudes that are going to spend a lifetime learning stuff, spend our days figuring out why things dont work the way we think it should, read the docs, RTFM, then search stackoverlfow, google, mailing lists, then bang our heads against our desk, then maybe ask on irc... we think you might be skipping all the earlier steps
[16:35:55] <grafi> explain what you want to do ... and why, not how
[16:36:03] <mordof> sunbeam: you haven't told us what the original goal is, instead of how you're trying to solve a particular problem involved in that goal, so how would we be able to help you?
[16:36:12] <mordof> sunbeam: we've been asking you for feedback on that for a while now
[16:36:59] <sunbeam> ok
[16:37:02] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: look at the solution i gave you. it should be pretty clear. if not, look at http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[16:37:02] <sunbeam> i have a map
[16:37:07] <sunbeam> i have 2 areas
[16:37:12] <sunbeam> when i hover over 1 area
[16:37:21] <sunbeam> i want the other (and the current) to be highlighted
[16:37:27] <jtal> CW: that is interesting and totally shady
[16:37:34] <sunbeam>  and highlight is not css, but a JS function
[16:37:56] <sunbeam> I cannot use mouseover because this will endlessly loop;
[16:38:14] <eddiemonge> $(area1).hover( -> $(area).toggleClass('hover') )
[16:38:24] <grafi> so basically you bind mouseover to area 1, and inside the callback call the highlight function for both elements
[16:38:33] <grafi> ?
[16:39:10] <eddiemonge> sunbeam area1:hover, area1.hover, area2:hover, area2.hover { define your hover styles }
[16:39:15] <sunbeam> grafi: there is no highlight function, it just assumes you do .mouseover
[16:39:15] <sunbeam> http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/docs/
[16:39:17] <sunbeam> this plugin
[16:39:27] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: It is JS NOT CSS
[16:39:33] <grafi> you just said it was a function ^^
[16:39:45] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: you asked a problem. i gave you a solution. the easiest solution
[16:40:33] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: again, its not CSS, with CSS I cannot recalc the area dimensions etc
[16:41:55] <eddiemonge> sounds like you are trying to rebuild an engine without knowing how to do an oil change
[16:43:15] <sunbeam> $(".multiple-parts area").hover(function(e) { $(this).parent(".multiple-parts").children("area").mouseover();});
[16:43:29] <sunbeam> this is what I do, but of course this does .mouseover too many times
[16:44:41] <Kre10s> don't do that. don't fire events like this manually. don't fire events manually at all if you can.
[16:45:05] <sunbeam> Kre10s: i know
[16:45:15] <sunbeam> but i wish i knew how to fire the hilight event
[16:45:22] <sunbeam> because i cannot find it in the docs
[16:45:57] <eddiemonge> Kre10s: this is not a good solution but http://jsfiddle.net/57GGf/
[16:46:12] <ryorky1> I am trying to delay a hover event action.  My delay is working properly, but it firing the action for all of the elements hovered over.  Here is my pastie:  http://pastie.org/8126336
[16:46:33] <eddiemonge> sunbeam: then read the source code
[16:47:10] <ryorky1> any ideas?
[16:49:13] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: i went through it
[16:51:10] <sunbeam> eddiemonge: the way the code is setup i think it is not possible
[16:58:27] <grafi> sunbeam .trigger('mouseover.maphilight');
[16:59:50] <sunbeam> grafi: yep, but the problem is that it will still keeps re-iterating
[17:00:29] <sunbeam> grafi: basically this works i tried this
[17:00:31] <sunbeam> but the issue is
[17:00:40] <sunbeam> that it double hilights (so 200% fill colour)
[17:01:03] <grafi> what?
[17:02:13] <sunbeam> grafi: it will hilight $(this) 2 times
[17:02:25] <grafi> well obv
[17:02:53] <sunbeam> and i only want to hilight it all once
[17:02:57] <sunbeam> $(".multiple-parts area").mouseover(function(e) {  $(this).parent(".multiple-parts").children("area").trigger('mouseover.maphilight'); });
[17:03:02] <ipwa> hello, trying to make a simple popup to display a message and email link, it works perfectly when there is only one: http://jsfiddle.net/n2NyS/1/
[17:03:22] <ipwa> when I use it on my site, I get the popup on every email buttonI click: http://maildev.filbaan.net/
[17:03:46] <ipwa> how can I change it so it only shows up one popup at a time
[17:04:40] <sunbeam> grafi: any idea how i can avoid this?
[17:05:06] <grafi> is the second area always the same then or what?
[17:05:31] <sunbeam> the area you hover over gets hilighted twice, it only should do that once
[17:07:22] <ipwa> making it simpler
[17:07:35] <grafi> thats not the question though
[17:08:02] <sunbeam> grafi: this is how i fixed it
[17:08:08] <ipwa> how can I show the popup that is in the same row when clicking the email link instead of showing all popups: http://jsfiddle.net/n2NyS/2/
[17:08:09] <sunbeam> $(".multiple-parts area").mouseover(function(e) {  $(this).addClass("current"); $(this).parent(".multiple-parts").children("area:not(.current)").trigger('mouseover.maphilight'); $(this).removeClass("current");});
[17:08:13] <sunbeam> not really efficient but it works
[17:08:42] <grafi> at long last
[17:17:46] <shoky> ipwa: using $(this).siblings('.subscription-popup')  for example   or .closest('.subscription-popup')  for the close button
[17:20:46] <ipwa> shoky I tried but it doesn't work
[17:20:55] <ipwa> I'm sure I'm doing something wrong
[17:20:56] <ipwa> http://jsfiddle.net/n2NyS/3/
[17:21:48] <shoky> ipwa: you're not passing "this"  to deselect first of all.. so inside that function this===window
[17:22:46] <shoky> ipwa: http://jsfiddle.net/n2NyS/4/
[17:23:06] <ipwa> shoky: dude you're a star
[17:23:14] <ipwa> thank you so so much
[17:23:17] <ipwa> :)
[17:23:21] <ipwa> shoky++
[18:11:39] <drim> Why when clicking just above or below the text in the button, the click event is not trigger ? http://jsfiddle.net/ZCkpE/13/ (but mousedown/mouseup yes)
[18:13:39] <jtal> clic! down! upup!
[18:14:07] <jtal> (thats in chrome)
[18:14:37] <drim> jtal: click just above or below the text
[18:14:46] <jtal> I did
[18:14:48] <Zesty> Hi, I need to send data across a subdomain via ajax (I dont care about the response, i only need to post some data). It also needs to work in IE7. Is JSONP the only thing I need to do?
[18:14:51] <drim> you will get mousedown/mouseup
[18:14:56] <drim> no click
[18:15:00] <jtal> I get click
[18:15:09] <drim> try differents places
[18:15:15] <drim> Im using chrome too
[18:15:37] <jtal> yeah it seems to be working for me everywhere
[18:16:02] <drim> how is it possible
[18:16:34] <drim> let me place a red dot somewhere
[18:17:11] <jtal> yeah lets dot it up!
[18:19:36] <drim> jtal: http://jsfiddle.net/ZCkpE/13/ click anywhere on the red thing
[18:20:02] <shoky> Zesty: the server needs to support jsonp, yah
[18:20:30] <Zesty> i guess I dont really follow how it's different from a regular request.. but its just a php script
[18:20:39] <Zesty> that uses $_GET
[18:20:46] <Zesty> and returns 200 once it parses that data
[18:20:52] <jtal> I dont see any red
[18:20:59] <jtal> just cyan background and blue text
[18:20:59] <Zesty> it seems to wrok, but i feel like im doing something wrong ...
[18:21:12] <drim> jtal: and here http://jsfiddle.net/XyJ9h/ ?
[18:21:20] <jtal> ok
[18:21:44] <shoky> Zesty: if you don't care about the response, maybe it doesn't matter if you make a real jsonp response or not
[18:21:51] <jtal> mousedown mouseup click!
[18:21:56] <shoky> Zesty: but know that jsonp requests are only GET, not POST
[18:22:00] <drim> jtal: lol :|
[18:22:14] <shoky> Zesty: a jsonp request is basically a <script src="..."> tag added to the page
[18:22:14] <drim> last chrome version ? mac/windows ?
[18:22:17] <jtal> wait,
[18:22:28] <jtal> its not doing it everytime it seems like
[18:22:29] <jtal> lemme see
[18:22:31] <Blade_> http://pastebin.com/C2EtsSpB anyone mind looking at that short code for me?
[18:22:35] <drim> ahh
[18:22:36] <Blade_> its a really simple question
[18:22:46] <Blade_> the question is inside
[18:23:02] <Blade_> thank you
[18:23:10] <jtal> if I do it at the very top, I only get mousedown
[18:23:56] <drim> very top of the button? or the red line
[18:24:04] <jtal> very very top of button
[18:24:21] <drim> ok for me too but it's doing the same thing on the red line
[18:24:35] <jtal> oh ok I get that too
[18:24:38] <jtal> its a very small window
[18:24:43] <drim> ouf
[18:24:56] <jtal> like 1 pixel heh
[18:25:04] <drim> yes maybe
[18:25:12] <JimmyXander> I have a question. Simple yes or no. Is it possible to create a .txt file on my server with Jquery. For example I type into a <textarea> and click on a save <button> then query puts that text into a .txt file on my server so that I can now visit http://mywebsite.co/txt/new.txt ?
[18:25:31] <drim> same thing below the text
[18:25:49] <jtal> yup
[18:25:57] <shoky> JimmyXander: no it's not possible. it's only possible to send data to your server and have your server create the file itself
[18:26:49] <JimmyXander> So, to be clear. The functionality I am describing would require server side coding to achieve. Such as PHP or Ruby?
[18:26:56] <shoky> yes
[18:27:04] <drim> jtal: weird no ?
[18:27:06] <JimmyXander> Would it be possible with Ajax?
[18:27:22] <shoky> JimmyXander: ajax is how you could send the data to the server
[18:27:22] <jtal> drim: yes...
[18:27:30] <Blade_> http://pastebin.com/C2EtsSpB my question is inside and its very simple, could someone take a look please?
[18:27:31] <AdamSewell> Could someone point me in the right direction here. I'm trying to load an image in a separate window to print. Basically, I have the url to the image, I just can't figure out how to load it to print.
[18:28:13] <drim> will be back in 5min, if you have any idea jtal  :-)
[18:28:18] <jtal> ok
[18:28:34] <Blade_> jtal http://pastebin.com/C2EtsSpB
[18:29:18] <JimmyXander> Thank you. My questions have been answered. Now off to begin learning Ruby
[18:29:22] <jtal> Jimmy: ajax makes a request to your server saying POST /some/path with the stuff from the textarea in the BODY of the request...  /some/path is php, or python, or node.js, or ruby...
[18:31:00] <Blade_> jtal: could you look at this please? http://pastebin.com/C2EtsSpB
[18:31:08] <jtal> I did I dont understand the question
[18:31:17] <jtal> do you want to know about the element inside the callback?
[18:31:17] <shoky> me neither
[18:31:35] <Blade_> you know how in javascript you can do the function name, function name(variable here) { ?
[18:31:52] <Blade_> how can I do that in jquery so in a link I can do onclick='function(id);'
[18:32:49] <shoky> Blade_: give a concrete example of what you want to do
[18:32:50] <jtal> is it because you want to know what was clicked on?
[18:33:29] <jtal> the event gets passed into the function, you just arent accepting it
[18:34:14] <Blade_> Okay, here is what i'd like to do. In php I have a while statement showing about 10 different users. On each link of the user it will have onclick='popup(userid);' on that click I want jquery to fade in a div in the center of the screen with the player info
[18:34:37] <shoky> don't use onclick attributes. bad bad
[18:35:09] <Blade_> okay well on this code: http://pastebin.com/C2EtsSpB the first jquery part, how can I get the id when they click on that then?
[18:35:12] <shoky> use $('.mylink').click(function(e) { var clickedElem = $(this); ... })
[18:35:18] <Blade_> $(this),id somehow
[18:35:22] <Blade_> oh
[18:35:39] <Blade_> alright that sounds good
[18:35:48] <Blade_> just last question.. what is the (e) in the function for?
[18:36:10] <shoky> sometimes you might want to prevent the default link action, so you can do e.preventDefault()
[18:36:21] <shoky> and there could be other uses but they're not relevant here
[18:36:27] <tw2113> the e is a variable holding the event
[18:36:32] <shoky> to get the id of the clicked element you can use  this.id
[18:36:36] <Blade_> what about return false;
[18:36:40] <shoky> or  clickedElem.prop('id')
[18:36:56] <shoky> return false  also prevents the default but it does other things too which are usually not needed
[18:37:01] <shoky> better to e.preventDefault()
[18:37:07] <Blade_> oh alright
[18:37:09] <Blade_> thank you very much
[18:40:55] <drim> re jtal
[18:41:12] <drim> did you find out what can be the pb ?
[18:44:27] <delinquentme> .focus() ... this no longer tells me what current element the user is interacting with ....
[18:44:35] <delinquentme> or am I using this entirely wrong
[18:45:55] <jtal> drim: so the real question is, why does it ever do click right?
[18:46:04] <jtal> because it shoudl only happen over the text
[18:46:29] <drim> what do you mean ? the click should be trigger if we click anywhere on the button no ?
[18:46:34] <shoky> drim: it happens because when you translate it down, the mouse is not over it anymore
[18:46:43] <jtal> ahhh
[18:46:45] <shoky> so it doesn't register the mouseup
[18:46:51] <jtal> that explains mousedown only at the top
[18:47:04] <jtal> shoky talk about click
[18:47:12] <drim> shoky: the mouseup is triggered
[18:47:20] <jtal> drim I think you need a container div
[18:47:23] <drim> shoky: it's the click which is not
[18:47:25] <jtal> and make that dig clicky
[18:47:37] <jtal> dig/div
[18:47:47] <shoky> drim: i'm not getting a mouseup triggered without a click
[18:47:56] <shoky> oh
[18:48:05] <shoky> you're returning false...
[18:48:09] <shoky> from the mouseup
[18:48:13] <drim> shoky: when clicking for example on the red line, you will get mousedown+mouseup
[18:49:07] <drim> shoky: (without the return false, it's the same thing)
[18:49:22] <jtal> what is a click anyway? is it when a mousedown+mouseuphappens?
[18:49:37] <drim> jtal: I mean you should see "click!"
[18:49:40] <jtal> at the very top its only a mousedown, no mouseup becuase the element is moved out of the way at that point
[18:49:50] <jtal> so that explains also why no click
[18:50:03] <drim> jtal: yeahh I understand for this one. But talking when you are clicking on the red line
[18:50:05] <jtal> click is probably when a mousedown and mouseup happen at the same area within an amount of time
[18:50:35] <jtal> hm...yeah thats true you do get a mousedown+up for the red line
[18:50:37] <jtal> but no click
[18:51:26] <drim> jtal: yes
[18:51:31] <shoky> probably because the mousedown and mouseup are not on the same element
[18:51:40] <jtal> ah, print out the element
[18:51:50] <shoky> mousedown is on the <p>  mouseup is on the <a>
[18:51:58] <drim> how do you see this ?
[18:52:12] <shoky> console.log(e.target)
[18:52:48] <jtal> shoky++
[18:52:52] <shoky> sorry i meant <span> not <p>
[18:53:56] <drim> shoky:
[18:54:23] <drim> I just added the span to show jtal where to click. I have just retried without it. Same e.target but no click
[18:54:36] <shoky> gimme a fiddle so i know what yer talking about
[18:54:49] <drim> you can try here http://jsfiddle.net/7bAcG/
[18:55:01] <drim> (same thing without the red line)
[18:55:21] <shoky> getting clicks..
[18:55:44] <drim> it's tricky to find it, it's a small window
[18:56:11] <shoky> hm
[18:56:25] <drim> did you get it ?
[18:56:54] <shoky> yeah sometimes
[18:57:17] <drim> same thing happends above and below the text
[19:05:18] <drim> any thoughts?
[19:09:07] <shoky> donno. could be a chrome/webkit bug
[19:10:31] <drim> only occurs with chrome ?
[19:11:18] <drim> looks like it's working with FF

[19:14:30] <nickmeagher> The width keeps changing and I'm not sure why?
[19:17:15] <nickmeagher> anyone?
[19:23:06] <nickmeagher> Not sure if theres a better way to animate these progress bars
[19:23:15] <nickmeagher> they have an HTML5 attr data-width
[19:23:28] <nickmeagher> getting that with jQuery then setting the width to it
[19:23:32] <nickmeagher> http://jsfiddle.net/fEL5g/
[19:23:43] <nickmeagher> Here is the page I'm having an issue on: http://icepick.co/services/
[19:56:41] <jsc802> can someone take a look at this page and tell me how to select a dynamically created form
[19:56:43] <jsc802> http://www.tumblrating.com
[19:57:18] <jsc802> on clicking 'suggest tags' in the dropdown to the right of the 'browse random buttons'
[19:58:08] <shoky> how to select it? $('#posttags')
[19:58:56] <jsc802> but that doesnt work
[19:59:14] <jsc802> $('#posttags').on("submit" is not grabbing it
[19:59:17] <shoky> sure does. it has to exist though for you to selec tit
[19:59:26] <shoky> that would select it fine when it exists
[19:59:39] <jsc802> but isnt that what .on is for
[19:59:45] <shoky> you can use event delegation. $(document).on('submit', '#posttags', function(e) { ... })
[19:59:55] <shoky> only if you take the time to read how to use .on
[19:59:59] <jsc802> oh
[20:00:02] <jsc802> thank u :)
[20:00:49] <Zesty> If I call         jQuery(function ($) { alert(window.test); }  ... further down page ... window.test = "it works";            will document ready wait until that JS has loaded?
[20:01:06] <Zesty> i know that is simplistic, i am having a hard time differentiating what constitutes as 'ready'... whether its JUST html and not JS
[20:01:13] <Zesty> or if that includes other scripts that are included iwth script tags
[20:01:21] <Zesty> and also possibly all the stuff that THOSE script tags could do
[20:01:59] <shoky> Zesty: the dom is ready pretty much when the browser has finished going through the whole <head> and <body>
[20:02:03] <jsc802> that worked shoky, thanks
[20:02:14] <shoky> if there are <script>s there, they'll be executed first
[20:02:27] <shoky> assuming they're normal scripts, not deferred/async or anything
[20:02:34] <Zesty> ah ok, yes they arent asynch
[20:02:42] <Zesty> just a really basic x = y; in the normal script tags
[20:03:06] <shoky> that'd probably work, but you shouldn't count on it
[20:03:10] <shoky> bad approach
[20:03:54] <m4rc> hi bitches
[20:04:20] <m4rc> I need help converting (Jul 04 2013 00:00:00 GMT+0800 (China Standard Time)) to Jul 04 2013
[20:04:38] <m4rc> currently using datejs library.. anythoughts?
[20:05:08] <shoky> what type is what you're trying to convert?
[20:05:19] <shoky> string? Date?
[20:06:06] <m4rc> shoky yes to string
[20:06:18] <shoky> from?
[20:06:49] <m4rc> something like Date.today(Date.parse(Jul 04 2013 00:00:00 GMT+0800 (China Standard Time)).toString('dd MMM. yyyy')
[20:07:23] <JamesMGreene> ugh
[20:07:25] <shoky> that's not correct javascript
[20:07:29] <JamesMGreene> Sorry for the long absense, guys
[20:07:35] <shoky> do you have a string?
[20:07:43] <JamesMGreene> Apparently the newer versions of mIRC actually disable the UI after the trial expires
[20:07:51] <JamesMGreene> So I've been running mIRC but without any UI  o_O
[20:07:58] <shoky> it's ok JamesMGreene. though i suspect you meant this for another channel? ;p
[20:08:08] <JamesMGreene> blargh, yes, sorry
[20:08:16] <shoky> it's ok !
[20:09:19] <jsc802> m4rc just do .toString and then .substring(0,13)
[20:09:29] <jsc802> ;)
[20:11:07] <m4rc> jsc802 awesome thanks :)
[20:13:13] <m4rc> shoky thanks for helping out.. was able to solve the problem. cheers!
[20:15:18] <shoky> m4rc you can also .toString('MMM dd yyyy')
[20:23:42] <Palani> Hi Guys ...Good morning
[20:26:52] <Palani> I gonna ask one silly question over here...Please dont anger on me....i wanna to print 01 to 99.....But wile printing 1 to 9 as single character how to make 1 to 01...There is any jquery API available
[20:29:00] <Palani> Where am going to use this is Date.....7-8-2013 to 07-08-2013
[20:29:18] <snover> no
[20:29:54] <Palani> Then we need to write separate function to check and update
[20:32:12] <wad> Time for my Easy Question of the Day! :)
[20:32:40] <wad> In javascript, I can do this stuff to put some text into a div: http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_document_createtextnode.asp
[20:32:46] <wad> What's the jQuery way to do that?
[20:37:05] <wad> Ah, I found it: $('#selector').append(text);
[20:53:09] <havenot> hey guys
[20:54:44] <havenot> i have an image split into 2 parts that I want to animate, 2 parts are separated by some small distance and I want animate them so the combine/fuze together and then rotate by 90*, is jquery suited for this?
[20:55:05] <havenot> they*
[21:10:29] <Palani> Hi ....I have a current date as 10-07-2013 and how to check that date is in between two dates like var startdate = "7-7-2013" , var enddate = "7-14-2013" and if( currentDate >= startdate && currentDate <= enddate ) { true; } else { false }
[21:10:47] <Palani> Am doing like this but not sure
[21:11:10] <Palani> Any alternate and correct method
[21:17:43] <Pavlov> Palani: you want to use better date formatting
[21:18:15] <Palani> @Pavlov....UTC Format
[21:18:27] <Pavlov> Palani: use date.toISOString() and compare those
[21:18:50] <Pavlov> or, just use "2011-12-19" instead of 10-07-2013
[21:19:05] <Pavlov> yyyy-mm-dd will work with string compares
[21:19:15] <Palani> Ok
[21:19:43] <Pavlov> needs to be 2 digit month & date
[21:22:33] <Palani> @Pavlov....There only i got stuck ...........How to make that one ...Am always getting as single letter
[21:22:53] <Pavlov> how are you getting the date?
[21:34:58] <wad> I'm using one of the themes from jqueryui. But inside of it, in one area, there is way too much of a gap between paragraphs (<p>first paragraph</p><p>next paragraph</p>). I need to override that in my .css file, but I'm not sure if that is padding, margins, leading, etc. How can I tell?
[21:35:04] * wad <---------- web dev noob
[21:38:19] <wad> Ah, I found it. Just set the margins and padding to 0.
[21:54:16] <Zesty> Can I send JSON to the server via JSONP? It seems some people choose to base64 encode the string first
[21:54:39] <Zesty> im not sure if i should do that, or if i can just do ... data: {"this": "that"}
[22:30:53] <shoky> Zesty: you can send anything you can send in a GET url
[22:42:57] <jay> hiii can some help me out here >>> http://tinker.io/acbed/3

[22:51:21] <MattDunbar> why are they being such bad free support that have a requirement to answer his question.
[22:51:46] <MattDunbar> lolol
[22:51:54] <MattDunbar> and he pm'd me for help.  I guess I had it coming.
[22:54:40] <MattDunbar> jay: If you came in and said - "X is happening while I am expecting Y.  I think … might be causing this.  Can anyone help me take a look into a possible solution?  Here is the current code <link>." I probably would've taken a look.
