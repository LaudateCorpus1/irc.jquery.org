[00:00:00] <nardev> Cork, ok :D
[00:00:02] <nardev> thank you
[00:00:05] <Cork> np
[00:01:52] <nardev> Cork, how would you select radio input somewhere within div which is only visible at the moment?
[00:02:16] <Cork> visible as in :visible?
[00:02:18] <nardev> despite rest of structure?
[00:02:26] <nardev> Cork, yes
[00:02:47] <Cork> i would hide them by adding a class to a parent or the element it self
[00:03:31] <Cork> and do $('form .visible input[type="checkbox"]')
[00:03:45] <nardev> :( maybe you didn't understand me... i have all .box already hidden, i actually fadeIn them one by one when i need them
[00:03:56] <Cork> ya, and that is my point
[00:04:02] <Cork> i would set a class for that
[00:04:02] <nardev> aha
[00:04:07] <nardev> aha
[00:04:09] <nardev> ok...
[00:04:22] <Cork> instead of depending on js looking though the computed css to find it out
[00:05:14] <nardev> Cork, so :visible is crashing the browser by searching element which has css display:hidden ...
[00:05:23] <nardev> display:none
[00:05:25] <nardev> sorry
[00:26:05] <arthur5005> Looking for advice: Writing a jQuery plugin, looking to override some of the dom manipulation functions. Any thoughts on using the function domManip() inside my plugin ? or should I just stick to using the publicly documented API?
[00:34:22] <Radditz> hello
[00:34:36] <Radditz> what is the difference between Object.creaete and $.extend ?
[00:38:55] <arthur5005> Radditz, Object.create makes a new instance of an object. $.extend merges properties onto already existing ones.
[00:39:09] <arthur5005> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/create
[00:39:16] <arthur5005> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.extend/
[00:39:46] <Radditz> arthur5005: so what I obtain from Object extends , it modifies the original instance?
[00:40:04] <Radditz> If I do extends( {}, original) I obtain the same as create ?
[00:40:11] <Radditz> original.create() arthur5005
[00:40:12] <Radditz> ?
[00:40:13] <Radditz> ?
[00:41:11] <arthur5005> best understood by example
[00:47:40] <mls_> hi all
[00:48:12] <mls_> Anyone got knowledge on Jahdrien Polyfill FileReader impl ?
[00:54:41] <PH> hola
[00:55:04] <PH> Is there an easy way to tell what operation is happening on a multi select dropdown? ie: add / remove?
[00:55:21] <tobago> what is the advocated way to create classes? I tried this: http://www.virgentech.com/blog/2009/10/building-object-oriented-jquery-plugin.html, but don't like to access the data method each time I want to access the functionality behind.
[00:55:34] <PH> I'm removing something from a multi select and I'm checked :selected, but its still true, even though I've removed the element
[01:06:10] <arthur5005> Radditz: it should be really clear, Object.create(objectA); will create a new instance of an object from the properties obtained from objectA
[01:06:46] <arthur5005> where as $.extend(objectA, objectB); will copy all of the properties of objectB into objectA and return objectA
[01:07:28] <spexi> Hi! I'm coding on a project that someone else has coded before, and I found now that jQuery 1.4.2 and jQuery 1.8.6 are included on every page. My boss wants datepicker on input field, and on the file is "jQuery UI Datepicker 1.8.6", but I have no clue how to use that with my input field. How do I bring it up when clicking on input field?
[01:07:45] <Radditz> arthur5005: I see
[01:07:49] <Radditz> arthur5005: ty
[01:08:10] <arthur5005> np
[01:08:46] <jl2753> hi, i'm stuck and hoping someone could give some advice or direction on how to proceed.
[01:08:51] <jl2753> http://jsfiddle.net/nncK6/3/
[01:08:59] <jl2753> whenever I enter 5 characters in input1, it hides the active (this is correct)
[01:09:08] <jl2753> but whenever I enter more than 5 characters, the active text then flashes
[01:09:15] <jl2753> I'm new to jquery and assuming that this has something to do with the keypress still being recognized?
[01:10:51] <arthur5005> spexi: What's confusing about this example? http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/
[01:11:56] <PH> jl2753: try this: http://jsfiddle.net/nncK6/4/
[01:13:03] <spexi> arthur5005: Well, I clicked the view source link, and copied only the <script> part, because I assumed I have everything else I need. And it didn't work. And of course I created an input field with id datepicker. Nothing just comes up
[01:13:37] <jl2753> PH: got it! thanks!
[01:13:49] <PH> np
[01:16:31] <arthur5005> spexi: it's very possible that the jQuery UI 1.8.6 version that is included in the website does not include the datepicker
[01:17:07] <arthur5005> spexi: This is because, the jQuery UI website allows you to download custom builds of jQuery UI with only the widgets you need.
[01:17:25] <arthur5005> spexi: are you seeing any errors in your console?
[01:18:40] <arthur5005> spexi: Your best bet, is to re-download the jQuery UI 1.8.6 as a full build with all the widgets and use that one.
[01:19:44] <arthur5005> Gonna ask again:
[01:19:45] <arthur5005> Looking for advice: Writing a jQuery plugin, looking to override some of the dom manipulation functions. Any thoughts on using the function domManip() inside my plugin ? or should I just stick to using the publicly documented API?
[01:23:39] <spexi> arthur5005: Actually, I'm quite beginner with javascript and jQuery, I don't know so well how to even debug. But there is this kind of section on the include file: http://jsbin.com/epojACu/1 (Looks like a mess but anyway) And of course I could use that jquery.com example all the way, was just thinking can it break up some other functionality on the page, if there are two jquerys included.
[01:25:23] <arthur5005> spexi: You're mistaken, there's only 1 jQuery being loaded up on the page, and that's the 1.4.2. The OTHER jQuery file that's being loaded up is likely jQuery UI 1.8.6 which is an EXTENTION to jQuery
[01:26:01] <frank_o> jQuery Mobile recommends binding ones JS to pageinit instead of DOM ready(). But how come that breaks this dropdown menu? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ksYFF/1/ (uncomment the first line). It no longer manages to organize itself into columns based on the height of the page.
[01:26:15] <spexi> arthur5005: But I mean, if I use the jqueryui.com/datepicker example. Then there's 1.4.2 and 1.9.1.js loaded
[01:26:31] <frank_o> * http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ksYFF/2/
[01:27:06] <arthur5005> spexi: you can only load 1 version of jQuery at a time. Lets say you were loading 2 version of jQuery, the second version you loaded on the page would override the first.
[01:27:33] <spexi> Yep, I thought too that may cause a problem.
[01:28:59] <arthur5005> spexi: show me the html page where 2 versions of jquery supposedly get loaded and I'll tell you if it's a problem. Otherwise, I can't really say you're making much sense.
[01:29:36] <spexi> Actually I can
[01:29:36] <arthur5005> spexi: nor can I say that you're qualified to deal with such issues, you should tell your boss they should find someone else.
[01:29:59] <arthur5005> spexi: although I'll give you credit for being on here ;). but no marks for not reading documentation :P
[01:30:52] <spexi> Well my boss has NO IDEA of anything this website has inside of it :D classic type of "implement this, of course it can be done and I'm sure it won't take long"
[01:31:01] <arthur5005> spexi: Also for the love of god, do yourself a huge favor and learn to use firebug/a debug console.
[01:31:36] <arthur5005> spexi: also it's your job to clearly communicate to your client what you're capable of/is possible.
[01:32:43] <arthur5005> *public shaming ended*
[01:32:48] <spexi> :D
[01:33:28] <frank_o> Does anyone use BrowserStack and know how to debug its Android and iPhone emulations? My JS won't work on those :(
[01:33:55] <ripthejacker> how can I set a div as an active element.
[01:34:26] <ripthejacker> I want to use keypress event only in a particular div. Is it possible?
[01:39:08] <TigerParket> Hello guys, what jquery plugin could i use for a responsive slideshow (mobile images are another cropped JPEG)
[01:39:43] <frank_o> TigerParket: Have you seen SwipeJS?
[01:39:52] <TigerParket> frank_o: Nop :)
[01:40:00] <TigerParket> frank_o: i'll see that now
[01:40:11] <frank_o> Do that :) It's tight :)
[01:48:00] <frank_o> If one binds all ones JS to pageinit as opposed to DOM ready (as recommended by http://api.jquerymobile.com/pageinit/), what does one do with 3rd party plugins that wait for DOM ready to finish before doing their stuff?
[01:48:27] <frank_o> http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ksYFF/2/ no longer manages to organize itself into columns based on the height of the page.
[01:51:01] <arthur5005> ripthejacker: Look at focus
[01:51:05] <arthur5005> ripthejacker: http://api.jquery.com/focus/
[01:51:53] <seutje> frank_o: isn't pageinit after doc.rdy?
[01:51:56] <ripthejacker> arthur5005: yes I tried that , but then after focusing when I print the activeElement it is still, <body>
[01:52:32] <seutje> ripthejacker: the element needs to be focussable iirc
[01:52:48] <arthur5005> ripthejacker: did you try giving the elemtent a 'tabindex' attribute
[01:53:01] <ripthejacker> seutje: is a td focusable?
[01:53:15] <ripthejacker> arthur5005: ok I'll try that
[01:53:33] <arthur5005> ripthejacker: "In recent browser versions, the event can be extended to include all element types by explicitly setting the element's tabindex property. "
[01:53:36] <seutje> ripthejacker: not by default, needs tabindex then
[01:54:33] <arthur5005> ripthejacker: Let us know if that works, I'm curious :)
[01:55:09] <ripthejacker> yes I'm going to try that, but it's the first time I'm hearing about it so reading some docs
[01:55:50] <arthur5005> ripthejacker: Good man (Y)
[01:57:48] <seutje> is that an MSN emote?
[01:58:03] <seutje> I always see it as a woman's hips though
[01:59:23] <frank_o> seutje: It means YOLO
[01:59:37] <frank_o> Hipster term
[01:59:40] <frank_o> Fuck swag
[02:00:14] <seutje> frank_o: nah, pretty sure it's the MSN emote for thumbs up
[02:00:22] <seutje> guess those things are lost to newer generations
[02:00:34] <PhlowHome> it's clearly boobies
[02:00:43] <PhlowHome> ( o Y o )
[02:01:58] <lite_> hmm
[02:02:12] <lite_> i cant get requirejs to consistently wait untill jQuery is loaded to load additional libraries
[02:02:26] <frank_o> seutje: Ah ok
[02:02:45] <frank_o> Yeah I'm only 13 so =)
[02:03:17] <seutje> frank_o: http://messenger.msn.com/Resource/Emoticons.aspx lil slice of internet history
[02:04:29] <frank_o> Cool
[02:04:43] <frank_o> So this is what you used to hit on girls before Facebook?
[02:08:39] <PhlowHome> 13... I started working at this company in your birth year... sigh
[02:09:07] <ripthejacker> seutje, arthur5005 thank you :)
[02:09:16] <ripthejacker> with tabindex it's working
[02:09:17] <ripthejacker> :)
[02:10:09] <frank_o> PhlowHome: Maybe it's time to quit your job then =)
[02:10:09] <arthur5005> ripthejacker: awesome :D good to know!
[02:10:39] <frank_o> Lots of my class mates in school have gotten filthy rich from apps already
[02:20:09] <mls_> Hi all, anyone got knowledge on Jahdrien Polyfill FileReader impl ?
[02:20:19] <seutje> nope
[02:20:25] <seutje> `g Jahdrien Polyfill FileReader
[02:20:26] <b-ot> seutje: Jahdrien/FileReader · GitHub → https://github.com/Jahdrien/FileReader
[02:20:56] <mls_> Yes I know this github, but no examples, and it's not working
[02:21:17] <mls_> even more, I'm following this example : https://github.com/blackbing/Jcrop/commit/eca0048a8c643c003c8b7cdbdeefbfb76114e6e5n and it still doesn't work. Kinda lost
[02:24:55] <seutje> mls_: I dunno man, never understood "polyfills" that need to be called differently from the native interface
[02:27:01] <mls_> seutje > maybe you know some method to use file api on IE9 and lower ?
[02:27:24] <mls_> This is why I'm trying this polyfill, but it's not working as expected (not at all for the moment)
[02:27:49] <mls_> seutje > I need to control file size before sending them
[02:29:23] <seutje> mls_: I usually use this list for reference https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills#file-api
[02:30:22] <mls_> just found it too, but jahdrien is listed in it. Might try another one, even if I don't like giving up on this one
[02:31:24] <seutje> https://github.com/mailru/FileAPI looks pretty solid
[02:36:05] <mls_> btw how to know which files I should embed in my project for this polyfill to work ? https://github.com/mailru/FileAPI
[02:36:36] <Narhir> hi
[02:37:01] <Narhir> I'm trying to use some code from here http://codepen.io/JoshBlackwood/pen/pEwHe
[02:37:10] <Narhir> on my website but in console it gives error for:
[02:38:00] <Narhir> TypeError: $ is not a function <second line> 	$('.read-more-content').addClass('hide')
[02:38:07] <Narhir> so it looks like it doesnt find jQuery ?
[02:39:30] <ko2in> @Narhir, have you already linked to jquery library ?
[02:39:39] <Narhir> but when I view source it ays it is linking to library..
[02:39:41] <Narhir> yes :/
[02:40:21] <ko2in> what's your jquery version ? and also, are you using other js library which has the same alias $ ?
[02:42:01] <Narhir> jquery 1.8.11 and I also see in code jquery.ba-bbq.js 12.1
[02:42:11] <Narhir> as well as jquery.colorboox
[02:42:22] <seutje> mls_: there's an example in index.php
[02:42:47] <seutje> Narhir: use a closure
[02:42:56] <Narhir> and.. I see some custom_search.js
[02:43:03] <seutje> (function($){ ... })(jQuery)
[02:43:22] <seutje> something is probably turning the global $ back into what it was before
[02:43:34] <Narhir> h,
[02:43:35] <Narhir> ok
[02:43:35] <seutje> so either access jQuery on the global object, or alias it urself
[02:43:48] <seutje> Narhir: Drupal by any chance?
[02:43:50] <ko2in> @Nahir: you should wrap with $(document).ready(function(){ // your codes }) or anonymous function like @seutje mentioned
[02:44:19] <seutje> ko2in: wrapping it with $(anything) will still make it error out with the same typerror
[02:44:38] <seutje> cause ur still calling $() which doesn't exist
[02:44:47] <ko2in> @seutje, oh yes .. thanks for pointing out
[02:44:52] <Narhir> hmm now it gives different error
[02:45:58] <Narhir> SyntaxError: missing } after function body  ....bottom.type != "undefined" && typeof Drupal[Drupal.settings.viewsSlideshowPager...
[02:46:14] <seutje> lint while u code!
[02:46:27] <Narhir> well I didnt code this issue above
[02:46:35] <Narhir> and it also seem like it is part of a module
[02:46:53] <seutje> oh great, views slideshow
[02:47:00] * seutje throws up a little in his mouth
[02:47:36] <Narhir> I think someone robably ahcked this module and it is causing issues now :/
[02:47:46] <seutje> is it a stable version?
[02:47:48] <Narhir> thank you for your help seutje
[02:47:52] <Narhir> dont evne know
[02:47:54] <Narhir> let me check
[02:47:58] <seutje> wow
[02:48:10] <seutje> should probably know this before trying it
[02:48:29] <Narhir> hmm okay this module isnt even installed..
[02:48:34] <seutje> coworker constantly uses that tripe... so annoying
[02:49:03] <Narhir> well didnt worked on slideshow I so I dont really know who did what I was told to create simple js funcionality....

[02:51:38] <neworder> Hi guys
[02:52:06] <neworder> I need to find a img and wrap it in a div and append it to another div with id of #list
[02:52:21] <neworder> I did this
[02:52:27] <neworder> var img = $(this).parent().parent().find('.pdt_image').clone();
[02:53:06] <neworder> the image I want to find has the class of pdt_image as the code above shows
[02:53:40] <neworder> $('#list').append('<div>' + img+ '</div>');
[02:53:46] <neworder> I can't get this to work
[02:53:49] <neworder> Pls help
[02:55:12] <Narhir> seutje:  now I dont have any errors.. I forgottne to close the tag :) but it still doesnt work :/
[02:55:17] <Narhir> however it deosnt give errors
[02:55:49] <seutje> Narhir: half the script is try/catch with empty catch...
[02:56:17] <seutje> neworder: you want to append a copy of the image to the other div, or the actual image?
[02:56:29] <neworder> a copy of the image
[02:56:33] <seutje> neworder: also, the div you are adding, does that get copied/moved over as well?
[02:57:07] <neworder> Yup,  I want to insert the image into a div and append it to #List
[02:57:23] <seutje> $('img').wrapAll('<div class="wrap" />').parent().clone().appendTo('.existingDiv');
[02:57:24] <frank_o> neworder: How about a fiddle?
[02:57:33] <seutje> http://jsfiddle.net/qUUgr/1/
[02:58:14] <seutje> note that the .clone() is called on the <div class="wrap" />
[02:58:31] <bigbugjava> hi, why when I hit  $('article').load("index.html article.content_switch"); , it goes to my app.js (node.js) and uses the /get function? this one: (app.get('/:sitename', function(req, res){)
[02:58:34] <seutje> wrapAll returns the element it was called on, so we go up to its parent (the div we just added)
[02:58:53] <neworder> Ah I see!
[02:58:55] <neworder> Lemme try
[02:58:57] <neworder> thanks
[02:59:58] <seutje> bigbugjava: sounds like a router.js issue, but u might wanna prepend that index.html with a / to make sure it's requested from the root
[03:00:33] <seutje> like if ur on www.example.com/foo and u request that, it'll request www.example.com/foo/index.html
[03:01:00] <bigbugjava> seutje I know.. tried ../index.html aswell
[03:01:30] <bigbugjava> because views on nano goes to /views
[03:01:38] <seutje> bigbugjava: does the request show up as expected in the network tab?
[03:01:54] <bigbugjava> weird thing :     $('article').load("pages/builder.html"); // works perfectly
[03:02:05] <bigbugjava> seutje checking
[03:02:24] <seutje> hmm, guess it might be the selector throwing it off
[03:02:38] <seutje> this is why I avoid those convenience methods
[03:02:53] <seutje> just stick to $.ajax() :P
[03:03:17] <bigbugjava> seutje sec.. I think you helped me figure this 1 out
[03:04:01] <seutje> IMPOSSIBRU!
[03:04:51] <bigbugjava> Request URL:http://localhost:3000/public/index.html
[03:04:51] <bigbugjava> Request Method:GET
[03:04:51] <bigbugjava> Status Code:404 Not Found
[03:04:56] <bigbugjava> umm.. that is the right path
[03:07:43] <seutje> weird, what page is this being called from?
[03:07:55] <seutje>  /public/ ?
[03:08:43] <seutje> oh, I thought u said it isn't the right path
[03:08:59] <seutje> well, if the request is going through correctly, the issue is prolly in the router
[03:10:59] <neworder> seujte: Thanks!
[03:11:01] <neworder> It's working
[03:11:13] <neworder> I need to put another image before pdt_image as well
[03:11:31] <neworder> I'm guessing I have to use prepend right
[03:12:20] <neworder> var $img = $('img').wrapAll('<div class="wrap" />').parent().clone().appendTo('.foo');
[03:12:35] <neworder> I have to add prepend after parent() right
[03:12:50] <neworder> prepend($('img'))
[03:16:53] <frank_o> Why when I bind this dropdown menu to pageinit (as recommended by jQuery Mobile), parts of it stop working? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ksYFF/5/

[03:48:20] <SprkDev> I have a peculiar question where google has failed me so far. I am using a script where I click "More text" or "less text" where the div expands to show more.

[04:03:53] <mn3m0n1c> and the chart is rendering well, just the highlights disappear when I give my own data to the chart
[04:04:20] <mobile8> ive got such a strange issue, I'm having a position: absolute; display: block; positioned relative to its parent, and top: -40px
[04:04:23] <mobile8> its only displaying half
[04:04:26] <mobile8> nothing is set to overflow: hidden
[04:04:28] <mobile8> any idea how I can debug whats hiding it?
[04:05:47] <ubersapiens> I have a 'ul' that is getting several 'li' appended to it. However, I want to hide the exceding 'lis' if index > max (max being a container size).
[04:05:49] <SprkDev> anyone?
[04:06:01] <ubersapiens> How can i run an .each loop on it
[04:16:04] <sacho> ubersapiens, var $li = $ul.children('li'); $li.slice(max - $li.length).styleMe()
[04:28:34] <ravionrails> is there any way to find out an ajax request is ongoing or not
[04:28:46] <Cork> not after the fact no
[04:29:05] <Cork> if you have a reference to the xhr/jqxhr object you can check its state
[04:29:18] <ravionrails> how?
[04:29:46] <ravionrails> is_completed? like this any method available
[04:29:54] <Cork> ravionrails: .readyState
[04:30:18] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest#Properties
[04:31:01] <Cork> so basically anything other then 4 means it is's ongoing
[04:31:01] <ravionrails> thanks Cork , actually i am looking for this in jquery
[04:31:16] <Cork> ravionrails: well the xhr object is the same
[04:32:11] <ravionrails> sometimes solution is at core :)
[04:32:40] <Cork> ravionrails: $.ajax and the shorthands is just wrappers around xmlhttprequest
[04:33:45] <ravionrails> yeah i know that, but never comes a scenario where i need .readyState of xhr object
[04:50:57] <_Phaoris> hi everyone
[04:51:26] <_Phaoris> i'm having an issue with jquery, i need to populate a select based on a previous select tag
[04:51:37] <_Phaoris> the data is gathered from a Json
[04:51:40] <_Phaoris> http://paste.laravel.com/10Di
[04:51:45] <_Phaoris> here is the code
[04:51:54] <_Phaoris> if someone could provide some insights
[04:52:03] <_Phaoris> it's not working :(
[04:53:01] <thoranai> hi
[04:53:15] <thoranai> anybody there???
[04:54:06] <PH> _Phaoris: use "json" as your last parameter in your $.get()
[04:54:09] <PH> and see if that helps
[04:54:17] <PH> thoranai: ask your question
[04:54:54] <thoranai> is it possible for me to iterate a table on document.ready function without any event attached to it?
[04:55:00] <seutje> sure
[04:55:22] <thoranai> how do i do that?
[04:55:43] <seutje> oh wait, what exactly do u mean by "iterate a table"
[04:56:03] <seutje> "a" implies singular, "iterate" implies plural, u wanna loop over the rows?
[04:56:54] <thoranai> yes. i wanna loop pver the rows
[04:57:21] <thoranai> over*
[04:57:23] <seutje> $(function(){ $('table tr').each(function(i, el) { /* 'this' and 'el' are a reference to the row */  }); });
[04:57:36] <seutje> this will not loop over tables separately
[04:57:38] <SprkDev> Is there a way to use slidetoggle and leave some text on the top when collapsed?
[04:58:26] <thoranai> we tried each() function...but the jquery was not able to find the table element at all...
[04:58:46] <seutje> thoranai: so this table isn't in the page when the DOM ready event fires?
[04:59:09] <seutje> SprkDev: slide is implied "hidden", if u wanna slide to a certain height, use animate
[04:59:53] <seutje> you could implement ur own step function, but that seems a bit backwards
[05:00:33] <SprkDev> this is getting very confusing and clearly jquery slidetoggle, toggle and animate all fail for CMS use. All websites I've google have assumed the same thing. This is so annoying. The text to be toggle will always change. On one profile it might be 20 lines on another it might be 5 lines. So I can't put a height.
[05:00:39] <thoranai> it is there but the DOM isnt able to find the same...
[05:01:12] <seutje> SprkDev: lolwat?
[05:01:43] <seutje> SprkDev: so u expect it to magically know how much space to leave at the top?
[05:02:00] <SprkDev> That is what I am trying to figure out.
[05:02:07] <seutje> guess we really need a display: just-right;
[05:02:15] <PH> LOL]
[05:02:37] <thoranai> <!DOCTYPE html>
[05:03:11] <thoranai> we use handlebars js to populate the table with data
[05:03:36] <seutje> handlebars is templating, so I take it you overwrite the entire table
[05:03:45] <seutje> thus it isn't in the page on doc.rdy
[05:04:18] <thoranai> yes it is a templating js
[05:04:34] <thoranai> how do i iterate it now?
[05:04:46] <thoranai> if that is the case
[05:04:50] <thoranai> ?
[05:06:01] <seutje> loop after it's rendered
[05:06:41] <thoranai> but i need to show a hyper link based on a column value on page load?
[05:07:06] <thoranai> on one of the columns
[05:08:28] <thoranai> may i have your name please and where are you based?
[05:08:41] <seutje> wait what?
[05:08:59] <seutje> so u have a table in the page, u wanna get at a link in that table, just before asploding it with handlebars?
[05:09:01] <thoranai> just wanted to know your name...
[05:09:13] <seutje> <-
[05:09:20] <thoranai> i will explain in detail...
[05:10:00] <thoranai> i have a table with multiple rows on it with 10 columns
[05:11:34] <SprkDev> How can I fix a min-height for slidetoggle?
[05:11:38] <thoranai> one of the column value will be either true or false based on some logic...if that column is true, then i need to show a hyperlink on the last column else don't show rather show the 9th column
[05:11:38] <PH> lol seutje hes ASL'ing you
[05:11:58] <PH> SprkDev: div class="blah" style="min-height: somepixels px;"
[05:12:09] <PH> then another div within that
[05:12:11] <PH> to do the sliding
[05:14:06] <PH> If you have a container for the slider, you can do whatever you want with it
[05:14:23] <SprkDev> i don't understand, this is what I have.
[05:14:28] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/ds3Vx4EW
[05:15:17] <PH> thats rly cool and all
[05:15:22] <PH> but where the hell is the rest of it
[05:17:27] <SprkDev> http://pastebin.com/V2zQtxEw
[05:20:06] <thoranai> <seutje> what i understand is that we will not be able to loop over the rows if we have handlebars js in in place to populate the table?
[05:22:01] <seutje> thoranai: sure u can
[05:22:22] <thoranai> can you guide me then?
[05:22:48] <garbagecollectio> hey
[05:22:49] <sysdef> hello! i try to select all divs with classes that starts with "foo_" and "bar_". is that correct? $(" div[class^='foo_'|class^='bar_']" ).click(...)
[05:22:56] <seutje> all you've told me is that you have a table, you put a link in it and then replace the table with handlebars?
[05:22:57] <garbagecollectio> why would $.ajaxSettings.Xhr
[05:22:58] <garbagecollectio> not be firing
[05:23:03] <garbagecollectio> if ajax request is being made?
[05:23:19] <garbagecollectio> that one thing should be fired all the time
[05:23:23] <Cork> sysdef: you shouldn't ever do it like that
[05:23:29] <Cork> sysdef: split the classes up instead
[05:24:04] <thoranai> no not like that...table gets replaced with handlebars on  page load itself?
[05:24:17] <thoranai> im not able to copy the code here....
[05:24:23] <seutje> garbagecollectio: small x
[05:24:26] <Cork> sysdef: class="foo bar some" $("div.foo, div.bar") or $("div.foo.some")
[05:24:28] <seutje> OR JUST FUCKING LEAVE, SURE
[05:24:53] <seutje> thoranai: oh, so replace the link after replacing the table
[05:25:01] <thoranai> <table class="table" id="iterate">
[05:25:14] <thoranai> <caption>
[05:25:23] <thoranai> {{machineName}}
[05:25:43] <thoranai> </caption>
[05:26:01] <seutje> thoranai: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18192504/how-to-execute-a-function-after-a-handlebars-helper-has-been-rendered#answer-18193352
[05:26:14] <seutje> that's an implementation that will allow u to run it on every template rendering
[05:29:12] <thoranai> <seutje> we do not maintain session in our application...
[05:29:20] <thoranai> it just has a index.html
[05:29:22] <thoranai> thats it
[05:29:47] <thoranai> we invoke a restful services to get the data as json
[05:30:01] <seutje> that's cool
[05:30:08] <seutje> not very related, but cool nonetheless
[05:30:09] <thoranai> and then with handlbars templating we replace the table
[05:30:35] <seutje> how does that affect ur ability to register a renderPage helper?
[05:31:07] <SprkDev> Arrg, it doesn't work! How do I put min-height on slidetoggle? :-(
[05:36:25] <sahbeewah> SprkDev, what does that even mean
[05:36:48] <sahbeewah> slideToggle is just an animated version of toggle
[05:37:32] <Cork> i think he means how to get slideToggle to work with min-height
[05:37:37] <Cork> and the answer is; you can't
[05:37:52] <Cork> as min-height will prevent the slide from going below the min-height
[05:38:33] <Cork> only option is to remove the min height on the target element
[05:41:30] <thoranai> <seutje? how do i raster a text followed by a textbox on a jquery dialog UI?
[05:41:51] <sahbeewah> oh, didn't realise min-height broke that, interesting
[05:41:57] <thoranai> im able to create a textbox on a jquery UI?
[05:42:15] <thoranai> but not able to precede that with a text value
[05:42:50] <Cork> sahbeewah: it's quite logical, as jquery changes the height of the element to do the effect; and if the element can't go below a height, it won't have an effect after that
[05:44:24] <sahbeewah> figures, but i would have thought jquery would animate min-height as well as height in the toggle function
[05:46:47] <sahbeewah> if i'm calling slidetoggle on a visible element, i would expect it to slide and disappear, irrespective of other css values, would you not?
[05:48:40] <Cork> not really
[05:49:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm using moment.js for date formatting, but the jqueryui datepicker has different abbreviations for day, month, year, etc... is there a way to make these work together?
[05:52:55] <bigbugjava> Question, If I send form by ajax, but untill I decied to send the form, I want to have a few Next and Prev pages, so form wont be in one big page, will all data be still inwith <form id = "myForm"> ??
[05:53:10] <kk_drop1> is it possible to use jquery datepicker with custom date range? becouse now it's limited to -10/+10 years and it would be perdect if I could enter year from keyborad in text input instead of picking option from select
[05:55:14] <Cork> bigbugjava: simplest is prob to just keep the form around and showing/hiding sections in it
[05:55:28] <Cork> that way the form would work like normal
[05:56:38] <bigbugjava> Cork alright, good idea
[05:56:39] <seutje> I usually implement multistep forms as true multistep on the server, so it gets processed properly without the ajaxies as well
[05:56:48] <seutje> granted, it's a lot more complicated
[05:59:20] <Cork> i usually just do a quick js validation and flip sections, and then have standard validation on the full submit
[05:59:25] <Cork> no ajax needed
[05:59:49] <Cork> only downside is that if an earlier step fails the validation it needs to flip back to that step
[05:59:55] <Cork> but it normally works fine
[06:00:09] <seutje> yeah, and remember state halfway the thing becomes a bit annoying
[06:00:27] <seutje> I can just reassign shit like that to the backender folks :D
[06:00:28] <Cork> ya, been there done that :)
[06:00:42] <Cork> but this one doesn't need to remember state
[06:00:51] <Cork> as it isn't really separate steps
[06:00:55] <sysdef> Cork: tyvm!
[06:00:57] <seutje> you know how them feature requests go ;)
[06:00:58] <Cork> it is just classes on elements in the page
[06:01:19] <seutje> recently had one that cause me to completely flip my BB app upside down
[06:01:31] <Cork> seutje: well i have to fix both front and backend so i don't normally push it either way
[06:01:36] <seutje> cause all of a sudden, all collections needed to be aware of eachother sortakinda
[06:01:37] <Cork> i want it fixed in the correct place :)
[06:01:54] <Cork> seutje: well it isn't hard as they are both there at the same time
[06:02:02] <Cork> just not always visible
[06:02:44] <seutje> well with the serverside implemetation, state is implied, so if they close their browser halfway and reopen it later, u can easily recover what they had without having to polyfill localstorage or something
[06:03:11] <Cork> seutje: well it depends if you want to store the state server side
[06:03:12] <seutje> well, guess that sorta depends on the backend implementations
[06:03:15] <Cork> we normally don't
[06:03:23] <Cork> cause then you have to purge that data from time to time
[06:03:26] <seutje> if it's over multiple pages, u pretty much have to, no?
[06:03:32] <seutje> session bound
[06:03:38] <Cork> not if it isn't really multiple pages :)
[06:04:10] <seutje> just add it to the get parameters? o.O
[06:04:22] <Cork> no the page doesn't reload
[06:04:29] <Cork> it is just a form with sections in it
[06:04:30] <seutje> oh "isn't"
[06:04:33] <frank_o> Howdy! Why when I bind this dropdown menu to pageinit (as recommended by jQuery Mobile), parts of it stop working? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ksYFF/5/
[06:04:41] <seutje> only reading half words today, sry :P
[06:04:44] <Cork> when you click next one section is hidden and then next is shown
[06:04:59] <Cork> the neat part is that it can even work without js
[06:05:02] <seutje> guess it depends on the use-case
[06:05:04] <Cork> (:active)
[06:05:25] <seutje> oh, been there
[06:05:38] <seutje> helped a friend make a framework for 100% css slideshows
[06:05:52] <Cork> ya, it's fun :)
[06:06:07] <seutje> lots of :active, ~ and + based CSS wizardry
[06:06:28] <Cork> you solved it around radio elements or hash tags?
[06:06:39] <seutje> no radios
[06:06:58] <Cork> radios is another way to do it
[06:07:04] <seutje> only 1 extra element to prevent the scrollheight to jump when going to #
[06:07:42] <seutje> most of it was done by the other guy though
[06:07:44] <seutje> http://benschwarz.github.io/gallery-css/
[06:08:54] <seutje> https://github.com/benschwarz/gallery-css/blob/master/sass/_gallery.scss
[06:10:06] <seutje> my coworkers hate it when I write CSS like that
[06:11:34] <rmah> they hate sass?
[06:23:02] <SprkDev> I think I might need to use slide instead. But this can only work if I can get the height from the page using php and assign it to the javascript variable.
[06:38:45] <SprkDev> How can I get the php variable into the javascript variable. It doesn't work http://pastebin.com/NPQQxWmj
[06:40:41] <seutje> SprkDev: if that file is served as .js, it won't be parsed by PHP
[06:41:03] <seutje> changing it to .php will probably asplode any form of caching
[06:41:14] <SprkDev> it is saved as a .php file
[06:42:19] <seutje> oh
[06:42:35] <seutje> well, either way, this seems like an apache issue rather than a jQuery issue
[06:45:20] <EnderMB> Hi all. I'm using Foundation and I'm having an issue with a span element replacement for a checkbox. I need to trigger a change event for an input when this span element is clicked. Specifically, I have some code in one file that needs to run, when the span is clicked.
[06:45:56] <EnderMB> Any idea on how I can get the checkbox change event to fire by clicking a span element next to it?
[06:46:22] <EnderMB> I've tried $checkbox.trigger('change') and other variants, but none seem to be working
[06:46:28] <SprkDev> ##php
[06:51:00] <NoiseEee> EnderMB: click
[06:51:56] <EnderMB> NoiseEee: I've tried the click event too, but that's not checking the checkbox either
[06:52:12] <NoiseEee> EnderMB: make up a fiddle i suppose
[06:55:29] <seutje> heh
[06:55:42] <seutje> on the demo page, calling .click() on the input or the label doesn't do anything
[06:56:05] <seutje> well, it changes the checked state, but the replacement doesn't respond to it
[06:58:11] <seutje> lol nvm, duplicate IDs on the demo page -_-
[06:58:39] <seutje> yeah, calling click on it works fine
[07:03:19] <anli> Isnt input.closest('#foo-container>div'); possible?
[07:06:57] <Cork> anli: http://jsfiddle.net/qVaBT/
[07:07:34] <Cork> aand one that is actually valid http://jsfiddle.net/qVaBT/1/
[07:07:39] <anli> oh, I must have done something wrong, thanks Cork
[07:07:45] <anli> oh
[07:07:48] <Cork> :)
[07:07:53] <Cork> just unclosed dives
[07:13:22] <saasd> What seems wrong on my second line? Its outcome is nyll. http://bpaste.net/show/fZkWVZOa577RVftHltD2/
[07:15:52] <Cork> saasd: do you really have an element with id="src" ?
[07:16:27] <saasd> Cork: yes
[07:16:45] <saasd> <input type="hidden" id="src" name="source" >
[07:17:37] <Cork> well except that you modify the page with it self no looks ok
[07:18:50] <Timmay> I have a bit of js code to add a pdf icon using :after to <a> tags, how can I remove that from one particular anchor (a.su-button-alert) tag?
[07:19:31] <Cork> Timmay: a.su-button-alert:after { content: '' }
[07:21:22] <SprkDev> My jquery is acting funny. I have successuly implemented the "show more" "show less" text thingy which expands/collapse when clicked. The only problem is when page first loads for only one second
[07:21:25] <Timmay> can you add the $() to that Cork? not sure if its $(a.su-button-alert:after { content: '' })
[07:21:36] <SprkDev> I can see it expand and collapse on its own
[07:21:59] <Cork> Timmay: :after isn't for jquery
[07:22:00] <malorie> I need to "load" some text, from a JS array, into a div and then pass that div to a function that does some formatting. I'm currently using .html() to load the text, but it's only succeeding 20% of the time due to the text not being properly loaded yet. what can I do to guarantee the text has been loaded?
[07:22:05] <Cork> Timmay: it is for css
[07:23:41] <Timmay> Cork: with jQuery would the command be jQuery('a.su-button-alert').css({'content':''});
[07:24:27] <Timmay> Cork: actually I tried with jQuery would the command be jQuery('a.su-button-alert:after').css({'content':''}); and it didnt work
[07:29:01] <Timmay> Cork: I got it. i made a class "no-after" with the command you provided and use $().addClass() and it worked.  THX!
[07:33:47] <anli> Is it possible to remove validation errors?

[07:34:40] <JamesH_1> Hi, Was hopping for some help I have a strange issue with escaped characters.  I am trying to select a field on page with tilde in the id (for example "field~1")  If I do ... $("#" + "field\\~1").val() it works, but if id do $("#" + myval).val() where myval is variable equal to "field\\~1" it does not work.  Any one got any ideas? Thanks
[07:36:55] <JamesH_1> I should add that using $("#" + myval).val() works find if the id does not have ~ in it
[07:46:28] <bigbugjava> Cork here man?
[07:47:05] <NoiseEee> JamesH_1: not the answer you wanted to hear, but are you sure you're not using the id attribute for something that a data- attribute isnt more suited for?
[07:50:07] <JamesH_1> NoiseEEE I do not follow?  do you mean use a data attribute so I could ref by this and make sure it does not contain the ~
[07:50:24] <JamesH_1> I still have the feeling that this is a bug in jquery
[07:51:15] <JamesH_1> someone else has had https://forum.jquery.com/topic/problem-using-a-variable-with-escaped-characters-as-a-selector
[07:51:47] <JamesH_1> although strangely the bug for it was closed although the bug seemed to be for a slightly diffrent issue
[07:55:45] <NoiseEee> JamesH_1: http://jsfiddle.net/Lnnf9/2/
[07:56:43] <NoiseEee> JamesH_1: i was really just remarking that i've never used a tilde in an ID in all my years of web development, and it *seems* like you're using the id attribute to store information that may be better suited on a data- attribute
[07:59:51] <abailarri> Hello. I implementd a google map using the v3 api on mi web, and I added a fadein function to the div that contains the map, but the map appears breaked
[07:59:56] <abailarri> Any suggestion?
[08:00:58] <Cork> abailarri: try using animate instead, and just animate opacity
[08:01:15] <Cork> i thing the api checks the size of the parent element when it starts
[08:01:32] <Cork> was a while since i used it, so i might be wrong though
[08:02:08] <GaryHost> Hi guys, can somebody spot the problem ? http://jsfiddle.net/gmrLk/2/ ? I get the correct response in firebug, the content of my div is diseappearing, but remains empty
[08:03:23] <abailarri> Cork, but I need to show/hide the map with the click action
[08:03:29] <abailarri> its posible with animate?
[08:03:47] <BillCriswell> GaryHost: Kind off of topic, but why aren't you using get? Also, why not using $.get?
[08:03:48] <Cork> abailarri: depends on how you want it to animate
[08:04:12] <Cork> abailarri: but yes it is normally possible, you need to fiddle with elements, overflow and a few other things though
[08:04:23] <rootshift> can anyone recommend me a image hover caption random effect plugin?
[08:05:00] <rootshift> a little like this - http://ryun.github.io/HCaptions/ but I don't believe that has the options for a random effect
[08:05:02] <GaryHost> BillCriswell: I followed a tutorial on Ajax, i'm a beginner
[08:05:24] <JamesH_1> NoiseEee I completely agree you are probably right.  The reason the ~ is that is is a vb6 app and before I arrived at the company someone wrote a rather horrid bit of code that when generating the ids/names to have the ~.  I should probably change the vb6 code but worried about it breaking other things.
[08:06:40] <Cork> GaryHost: $.post("php/query_database.php", query).done(functiondata) { $( "div.loading" ).replaceWith(data); });
[08:06:47] <Cork> that should replae all the code you have
[08:07:11] <Cork> though i'm not sure you want replaceWith
[08:07:55] <GaryHost> Cork: I'm trying you solution, but why not replaceWith ? I want to totallyh replace the old div
[08:07:58] <shoky> his code works fine tho - http://jsfiddle.net/gmrLk/3/
[08:08:04] <shoky> GaryHost ^
[08:08:12] <Cork> GaryHost: then ya, that is correct
[08:08:19] <BillCriswell> GaryHost: Ah ok! What Cork said it right besides the missing ( between function and data. I'd defintiely do that. I wouldn't use $.post() if you're just trying to GET  data, though.
[08:08:39] <Cork> :x
[08:10:55] <GaryHost> Cork: BillCriswell : SyntaxError: missing ) after argument list...tabase.php", query).done(functiondata {console.log(data); $( "div.loading" ).rep... ;)
[08:11:13] <Cork> GaryHost: see BillCriswell's comment
[08:11:22] <Cork> i typoed the function(data) part
[08:12:35] <NoiseEee> JamesH_1: well it seems that my fiddle works, so...
[08:14:50] <GaryHost> Cork: so, this should work, right ? $.get("php/query_database.php", query).done(function (data) {console.log(data); $( "div.loading" ).replaceWith(data); });
[08:15:21] <Cork> GaryHost: you did post in the original code, but ya if you want get that should work
[08:15:55] <shoky> tho it's using that query var differently than his original code
[08:16:09] <rmah> all your ""'s, ()'s and {}'s match if nothing else
[08:16:31] <Cork> ah, right he concated it
[08:17:08] <GaryHost> Ok, i can see the reponse in Firebug, but it is still not replacing my old div...
[08:17:30] <Cork> GaryHost: are you sure the selector matches the element you want it to replace?
[08:18:13] <GaryHost> Cork: does $( "div.loading" ) match <div class="loading" id="loading"></div> ?
[08:18:23] <Cork> yes
[08:18:24] <GaryHost> It should, right ?
[08:18:32] <shoky> GaryHost: your original code works in the fiddle, so you're doing something different locally from the fiddle
[08:18:33] <Cork> but test it
[08:18:53] <Cork> console.log($('.loading').length)
[08:20:08] <GaryHost> Cork: 1 before the query, 0 after
[08:20:25] <Cork> then the element is replaced
[08:20:31] <GaryHost> I can see the div disseapear, but nothing replaces it
[08:20:33] <rmah> there ya go
[08:20:37] <Cork> ah
[08:21:43] <Cork> GaryHost: try $("div.loading").replaceWith($.parseHTML(data))
[08:21:57] <Cork> shouldn't matter, but...
[08:22:19] <GaryHost> Cork: nope, no change
[08:22:23] <GaryHost> :(
[08:22:50] <Cork> and you're sure nothing else is messing with the page when the ajax is done?
[08:22:54] <BillCriswell> GaryHost: If it's in the loading div shouldn't it hide when shit is loaded?
[08:23:27] <Cork> BillCriswell: i think he has a loading screen, and when the content is loaded it replaces it
[08:23:28] <Clorith> I'm trying to locate an event that'll trigger before a jQueryUI datepicker object on an input box, is there such an event, so far I've had no luck with the obvious stuff like .focus .click and such
[08:23:56] <GaryHost> Cork: I Honestly don't know, the function in launched by onload= in the <body> tag
[08:23:59] <Cork> Clorith: you mean before it shows?
[08:24:07] <Clorith> Yeah
[08:24:21] <Clorith> I'm tryign ot populate the date box with a preset date that it'll be able to pick up
[08:24:22] <shoky> GaryHost: pastebin/jsfiddle your updated code, including everything
[08:26:35] <Clorith> Hmm, using mouse enter as an event seems to do the trick
[08:26:36] <shoky> Clorith: why not just set its value?
[08:26:46] <GaryHost> Thanks so much for your help guys : http://jsfiddle.net/gmrLk/4/
[08:26:50] <Clorith> The value is dependant on other factors in the form chosen first
[08:27:08] <Clorith> And it uses a generic .datepicker class so I can't use the built in actions
[08:27:18] <Cork> Clorith: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-beforeShow
[08:27:20] <Clorith> (I could by makign a custom one for it, but I'd like to avoid it if possible)
[08:28:47] <GaryHost> all right new element : If I replace $( "div.loading" ).replaceWith(data); by $( "div.loading" ).replaceWith('this is a dub text');, the text appears in the div...
[08:29:03] <GaryHost> So the HTML code seems to be a problem
[08:29:32] <Cork> GaryHost: what is the parent of the .loading element?
[08:29:36] <shoky> :-o
[08:30:10] <GaryHost> Cork: <div class="gallery flexslider" id="questions"><div class="loading" id="loading"></div></div>
[08:30:24] <Cork> huh...
[08:30:29] <GaryHost> I shoked shoky :)
[08:30:33] <shoky> GaryHost: what do you see in firebug html/elements view  after the replace?
[08:30:42] <shoky> do you see the <ul> there?  or is it empty
[08:31:32] <Cork> oh
[08:31:35] <Cork> the html is invalid
[08:31:45] <Cork> <a href="?id=2">test<a>
[08:31:50] <Cork> <a href="?id=2">test</a> <--
[08:31:59] <GaryHost> holy c**p
[08:32:05] <Cork> that shoudn't be the problem, but...
[08:32:19] <Cork> you should get a bunch of extra a tags
[08:32:24] <Cork> not an empty string...
[08:33:16] <GaryHost> Yes, the html is now valid, I can see the ul, li, etc... inf firebug after the replace, but they are in display: none;
[08:33:28] <shoky> ;p
[08:33:46] <Cork> O-o
[08:33:48] <shoky> `cc
[08:33:48] <b-ot> shoky: CASE CLOASED >:|
[08:34:29] <GaryHost> I honestly don't get it
[08:34:34] <shoky> check your css..
[08:34:53] <Cork> GaryHost: check the css tab for the elements
[08:35:01] <Cork> it should point you to where it is set
[08:51:00] <malorie> how can I add an event listener to everything on my site except a certain element?
[08:54:58] <Cork> malorie: $(document).on('click', '*:not(.exception)', function() {})
[08:55:07] <Cork> or just check event.target in a plain click event
[08:55:14] <malorie> ah, I see. thanks
[08:58:32] <Sebb> hey.. I've discovered something where I'm not sure whether it's a bug in jquery or in the color picker from https://github.com/Gautier/jquery-colorpicker-mobile - when I open the colorpicker via a click-event on a div and then click somwhere else on the page, it doesn't open again the next time I click the div, but instead after clicking again then...
[08:59:05] <Sebb> and when clicking the first time it executes a part of jquery where the code is saying "// Discard the second event of a jQuery.event.trigger() and when an event is called after a page has unloaded"
[08:59:25] <Sebb> but that event should not be discarded ;)
[08:59:53] <Cork> Sebb: sounds like a bug in the plugin
[09:00:19] <Cork> might be it was built for an older version of jquery, how events are handled in jquery has changed quite a bit in later versions
[09:00:39] <Cork> from 1.5 and up to 1.9
[09:00:55] <Sebb> it's shipped with an old version of jquery (1.3.2), I tried with 1.4.2 and 1.10.2, it always behaves the same..
[09:01:47] <Cork> have you tried with 1.3.2?
[09:01:54] <Sebb> yes, same behavior
[09:02:08] <Cork> contact the developer then
[09:04:26] <Sebb> umm.. okay...
[09:23:53] <bberry> is it bad practice/ugly code to have variable declarations in if statements?
[09:25:21] <Cork> bberry: you can't really have declarations in if statements
[09:25:39] <Cork> the engine lifts the declaration out of if cases
[09:25:48] <bberry> interesting...
[09:26:10] <bberry> that could break things
[09:26:15] <Cork> not really
[09:26:23] <Cork> it only lifts the declaration
[09:26:33] <Cork> the definition of the value stays
[09:27:02] <Cork> if() { var a = 1; } is the same as var a; if() { a = 1; }
[09:27:11] <bberry> ah
[09:27:13] <bberry> okay
[09:27:25] <bberry> well
[09:27:32] <bberry> i assume you meant if(var a = 1)
[09:27:43] <Cork> you can't do if(var a = 1)
[09:27:48] <Cork> that isn't valid
[09:28:35] <bberry> >> if((var a = 1) === 1){ console.log("works");}
[09:28:37] <Cork> cause if would check the return value of var not the a
[09:28:39] <bberry> bah
[09:28:47] <Cork> that would check if undefined === 1
[09:28:54] <bberry> inthmm ur right
[09:28:56] <bberry> doesnt work
[09:29:01] <bberry> i totally thought it did >.<
[09:29:18] <bberry> yeah
[09:29:44] <bberry> i was trying to do if((var res = $.grep(json.Variables, function(element){ return element.name === editing})).length > 0)
[09:29:48] <bberry> but that toally isnt going to work
[09:29:49] <bberry> lol
[09:29:58] <bberry> actually
[09:29:59] <bberry> will it?
[09:30:04] <Cork> nope
[09:30:15] <Cork> undefined doesn't have a length
[09:30:25] <bberry> gotcha
[09:30:27] <bberry> man
[09:30:39] <bberry> oh well
[09:37:28] <Purduecer> Hi everybody, I'm using the v1.0 of the JQuery chosen plugin, but I can't seem to get it to fire a change event. I have an example pastebin here: http://pastebin.com/xGEv29np and a development webpage that illustrates the concept here: https://engineering.purdue.edu/ece477/preview/Archive/archive.php
[09:37:45] <Purduecer> Is there any kind soul out there that can point me in the right direction?
[09:38:45] <grafi> souls?
[09:38:47] <grafi> naaa
[09:38:53] <Purduecer> haha, fair enough
[10:03:04] <frank_o> Sorry y'all. Still deep in this. Why does this dropdown menu stop working after I bind it to pageinit (as recommended by jQuery Mobile)? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/ksYFF/5/
[10:07:23] <rmah> frank_o: define "not work"
[10:09:16] <frank_o> rmah: It's no longer able to organize its links into columns. I found some related questions on StackOverflow but no answers. Please see the fiddle for more info.
[10:09:49] <rmah> frank_o: it's because the div has no width
[10:10:24] <rmah> frank_o: fixed http://jsfiddle.net/ksYFF/8/
[10:11:01] <Ali_C> hi
[10:11:11] <Ali_C> is it possible to detect browser presence via jQuery?
[10:11:25] <rmah> a browser is always present
[10:11:42] <sacho> not since 1.8 I think
[10:11:49] <rmah> ok
[10:12:02] <frank_o> rmah: Ooooh =)
[10:12:20] <sacho> oh, since 1.9.
[10:12:46] <DeeJRoth> Hey group. I hope everyone is doing well today. I keep getting an error when trying to build jquery on Wind7 HomePrem. Is this the correct place to ask such a question?
[10:12:46] <Ali_C> how can I build a multiplayer web based 2D game
[10:12:54] <Ali_C> think ajax is not enuff
[10:13:02] <frank_o> rmah: Just like that huh? Yeah, lines 28-33 are supposed to be setting the width. Somehow those widths refused to work in pageinit unless width: 100% is specified via CSS?
[10:13:06] <rmah> Ali_C: usually with code and graphics
[10:13:22] <rmah> frank_o: I didn't look at the js
[10:13:31] <Ali_C> rmah: the prolem is "how to detect session"
[10:13:39] <Denommus> Ali_C: HTML5 canvas, Ajax and some backend for doing the sync between players
[10:14:39] <rmah> Ali_C: people usually use a cookie with a unique session id for that
[10:14:46] <frank_o> rmah: Makes perfect sense now
[10:14:50] <frank_o> rmah: Thanks
[10:14:55] <rmah> de nada
[10:15:06] <frank_o> rmah: Hey aren't you the owner of #startups?
[10:16:09] <DeeJRoth> Is this the correct place to ask questions about building jquery via npm?
[10:16:28] <rmah> frank_o: I am an op there but not the uber-op
[10:16:40] <Ali_C> DeeJRoth: ask in #node.js , they are super friendly there
[10:16:45] <frank_o> Cool :)
[10:16:48] <DeeJRoth> ok. Thank you
[10:20:38] <frank_o> rmah: Oops, turns out we forgot to uncomment the actual bind to pageinit :D
[10:21:57] <rmah> frank_o: haha
[10:22:25] <frank_o> My bad for not pointing that out
[10:23:10] <m_gol> DeeJRoth: what problems do you have?
[10:24:07] <DeeJRoth> i keep getting this error after running "npm install"...crap I will send you a screenshot if that is feasible?
[10:24:16] <m_gol> you can put it on pastebin
[10:24:25] <m_gol> pastebin.com
[10:25:06] <DeeJRoth> ok. I will do that
[10:26:39] <m_gol> DeeJRoth: but try to hurry, my battery is at 7% :)
[10:29:39] <m_gol> DeeJRoth?
[10:30:26] <Denommus> any channel for CSS doubts?
[10:31:43] <DeeJRoth> m_gol: http://pastebin.com/L5rX9zp4 (sorry, child in potty training)
[10:32:06] <m_gol> 3% so don't feel offended if I disappear ;)
[10:32:50] <m_gol> DeeJRoth: is this on a master branch? fully updated?
[10:33:37] <DeeJRoth> Let me double check that
[10:34:22] <DeeJRoth> m_gol: it is master, just downloaded today. I am assuming (i hate that word!) that would be fully updated.
[10:34:37] <m_gol> yes...
[10:34:55] <m_gol> please, report a bug on bugs.jquery.com, I'll look into that later
[10:34:59] <m_gol> gotta go now, 2% ;)
[10:35:00] <DeeJRoth> thank you
[10:35:09] <m_gol> np
[10:36:07] <Ali_C> why doesnt jquery code have an event for mousewheel up and down
[10:36:11] <Ali_C> without
[10:36:16] <Ali_C> plugins etc
[10:36:19] <Ali_C> direct
[10:36:24] <Ali_C> in the core.
[10:36:31] <Ali_C> like click.. or hover
[10:37:42] <duch_kazatel> Ali_C you mean like the .click() native method?
[10:39:28] <dcrouch> Greetings.  I have the following.  http://fpaste.org/48348/13823771/   Wondering what would be best way of getting a pre-defiined key into stripe via lines 8,9.  I have something wrong I know.
[10:55:25] <BillCriswell> dcrouch: Why do you think it's wrong?
[10:56:53] <JimmyXander> Hey guys
[10:57:10] <JimmyXander> any idea how to detect when the [esc] key is pressed?
[10:57:20] <JimmyXander> I'm thinking keydown?
[10:57:42] <dcrouch> BillCriswell, should that be fine.  If so I have errors elsewhere that was created when I made the 8,9 change.
[11:00:06] <FernandoBasso> I have a small piece of code that follows a link. The link is inside a div, and no matter where the user clicks, the code finds the link and follows it. The problem is that when jQuery/javascript follows the link, it leaves behind the 2 (or whatever other id is there) in the url causing the link to go to an unexisting page. You can see it here: http://www.clinicaquirocare.com.br/2/quiropraxia If you hover the cursor over "Leia Mais", it shows the co
[11:00:59] <BillCriswell> dcrouch:I see the problem now. Why don't you set pk in the payment form submit callback? var pk = $('#pk').val(); in the <head> not wrapped in document ready won't return anything.
[11:01:16] <sacho_> FernandoBasso, I dont see what 2 you are talking about
[11:02:00] <FernandoBasso> sacho_: Don't you see the "2" in the link I have provided?
[11:02:44] <FernandoBasso> When I hover the cursor over "Leia Mais", it doesn't show the 2 (and it really shouldn't), but after one clicks the link, it puts the 2 in the url.
[11:05:22] <Sendoushi> hey guys. what do you use for a natural parallax scrolling effect? I'm trying to make the elements "explode"
[11:05:55] <andrew9183> explode?
[11:06:05] <andrew9183> theres a bunch of libraries for paralla
[11:06:10] <andrew9183> *parallax, check out skrollr
[11:06:36] <Sendoushi> yes. i want that as you scroll the elements get back together and then they go back to their "exploded" positions
[11:06:38] <andrew9183> stellar.js as well
[11:06:48] <andrew9183> yeah that is possible
[11:06:51] <sacho_> FernandoBasso, I don't see that happening.
[11:07:08] <Sendoushi> i was checking skrollr but sucks a little for being on the html and not letting me do stuff like "back to the position"
[11:07:13] <Sendoushi> i'll check that stellar.js
[11:07:45] <Sendoushi> by the way i'm using jquery. tried already the superscrollorama but very unnatural for what i'm trying to achieve
[11:08:33] <sacho_> just to be sure, you should make sure you have a slash in front of your relative links so they're relative to the domain
[11:10:25] <Sendoushi> i wanted to give them the actual position and the new one and with the scroll they approach little by little
[11:14:30] <FernandoBasso> sacho_: Have you tried in IE?
[11:15:57] <sacho_> yes
[11:16:00] <sacho_> consider what I said
[11:19:03] <FernandoBasso> sacho_: All right. Thanks. I don't know why it happens here then...
[11:19:17] <myosotis> How can I submit a form bypassing the onSubmit handler?
[11:19:34] <myosotis> afaik I'll have to remove the onSubmit handler prior to submission
[11:20:50] <sacho_> serialize it and post it via xhr
[11:21:14] <myosotis> thanks sacho_, not sure why that didn't occur to me
[11:25:26] <BillCriswell> myosotis: You can look into event namespaces? Might be able to help you work around it.
[11:29:55] <myosotis> BillCriswell, that's probably the method I will end up using
[11:33:50] <grafi> event namespaces are awesomesauce
[11:33:51] <grafi> :)
[11:34:12] <grafi> its like events
[11:34:16] <grafi> but with namespaces
[11:34:19] <grafi> hi BillCriswell ^^
[11:34:42] <Psy-Q> is there something i can bind to other than .ready() that fires after the initial page load has completed? i have a script that loads after jquery and classes that i add to a form that script generates are not added because those elements aren't in the DOM at the time ready() is called, it seems
[11:35:18] <BillCriswell> grafi: Howdy!
[11:35:25] <Psy-Q> or could i wait until the form elements appear and then add the classes? i don't know what's the decent way to do it
[11:36:53] <Psy-Q> hey! i bound to .load() and that seems to work fine
[11:37:51] <grafi> fun times
[11:38:24] <grafi> BillCriswell ever used s3, ec2, cloudfront?
[11:38:25] <grafi> :P
[11:39:23] <BillCriswell> grafi: I have not. Not much of a server person. Maybe one day haha
[11:39:45] <grafi> that day is comming closer for me
[11:39:56] <grafi> decisions decisions
[11:39:57] <grafi> :p
[11:44:44] <dpritchett> morning!
[11:45:21] <grafi> evening
[11:45:52] <dpritchett> It shouldn't be too hard for me to set up an event handler for a non-DOM object, right?
[11:46:44] <myosotis> this is my first exposure to event namespaces
[11:46:51] <myosotis> they seem fairly useful
[11:47:30] <grafi> non-dom @ dpritchett ?
[11:47:59] <DeafGoose> Hey guys, Im running a plugin that has a callback function. Im trying to get the previous elements input value from within the callback using $(this ).prevAll().val() but its not working. I guess Im doing something wrong by using $(this) but can't figure out what I need to do
[11:48:52] <dpritchett> meaning it isn't associated with an HTML element
[11:49:14] <grafi> so what is it oô
[11:50:51] <duch_kazatel> dpritchett wat
[11:51:22] <duch_kazatel> what is it associated with, then?
[11:51:42] <grafi> duch_kazatel event handler for the doorbell
[11:51:43] <grafi> :P
[11:52:25] <dpritchett> it's just a javascript object that I use to store the various pieces of the total price
[11:52:44] <duch_kazatel> and you want to "watch" it?
[11:52:51] <dpritchett> and while I have HTML elements that on update will change the components of my price-holder object I don't want it to be bound to anything specifically
[11:52:56] <dpritchett> exactly, duch_kazatel
[11:53:16] <dpritchett> So maybe my 5 relevant UI elements could have handlers that change the price-holder object, and then the price-holder itself could have a change handler that updates the displayed price
[11:54:08] <duch_kazatel> dpritchett there's no event handler like that sadly.
[11:54:39] <duch_kazatel> i mean, you could setup a "watcher", but that's terribly inefficient.  your best bet is some kind of proxy function that handles all that logic for you explicitly.
[11:55:15] <duch_kazatel> so you call it when you run your update and then it dispatches all your other changes.
[11:55:30] <duch_kazatel> but there's no event that gets fired when you update an object.
[11:55:55] <dpritchett> Part of why I was hoping to do it in an event-driven way is that it would help me not worry about the asynchronous nature of htese updates.
[11:56:15] <kpl> How do I execute a javascript string stored in a javascript variable?
[11:56:28] <duch_kazatel> dpritchett you still do it event-driven, you just have to call to it.
[11:57:20] <dpritchett> ok, so all five of my "update your piece of the price components object" handlers should end with a call to recalculatePrice() ?
[11:57:34] <dpritchett> and then I can just trust the interpreter to recalculate them in the order in which they come in?
[11:57:42] <bberry> is there a way to get this to work? http://jsfiddle.net/EXHuQ/ i want to be able to use the remove like ("#outerdiv").remove("#divtoberemoved");
[11:57:50] <duch_kazatel> yup.  or setup a queue of some kind.
[11:58:02] <duch_kazatel> or look at angular/backbone/any of the MV* frameworks for JS.
[11:58:11] <bberry> although, i guess since im using ID's that wont be purposeful anyway
[11:59:08] <duch_kazatel> bberry $('#parent').find('$child').remove()
[11:59:18] <duch_kazatel> err, .find('#child')
[11:59:25] <dpritchett> This is a single page with minimal additional functionality, duch_kazatel.  Not sure it needs a framework just yet.
[11:59:43] <bberry> duch_kazatel: right! okie doke.
[11:59:54] <duch_kazatel> dpritchett just sayin' - the functionality you want doesn't exist in JS.
[11:59:58] <bberry> duch_kazatel: I get tunnel visioned with this stuff >.<
[12:00:23] <duch_kazatel> bberry it's totally fine :)  I've had that happen before - sometimes you need to step back.
[12:00:32] <duch_kazatel> rubber duck problem solving and all that.
[12:00:34] <kpl> found a (dangerous) way: eval(). Why is it considered dangerous if a user could be able to inject/run an eval in his browser anyway? Or is there a way to prevent a user from doing that?
[12:00:50] <grafi> just set up a method on the priceholder object and let it make the changes to the object and then call the update method dpritchett that should work fine
[12:01:09] <duch_kazatel> kpl http://stackoverflow.com/questions/86513/why-is-using-the-javascript-eval-function-a-bad-idea
[12:01:44] <bberry> ya
[12:02:27] <duch_kazatel> kpl where is this code coming from?
[12:03:28] <kpl> It comes as part of a JSON object returned from an ajax call to the server.
[12:04:01] <duch_kazatel> kpl err, your JSON should be data, not code.
[12:04:19] <duch_kazatel> pull your logic out and make it static on the page.
[12:05:28] <kpl> We can inject html from a ajax call. Why not run some jacascript on the injected html?
[12:06:06] <kpl> Is it dangerous from a security perspective, or just error prone coding?
[12:09:43] <kpl> What about the $.getScript() or jQuery.ajax() with dataType script? Doesn't it evaluate a returned string as javascript in the browser?
[12:37:40] <teasercss> hello I need to listen the click on the body element
[12:38:02] <teasercss> this does not seem to work
[12:38:04] <teasercss> $('body').on('click', function() {
[12:40:41] <gary_b> i have to cram learn some jquery for an interview, any tips on resources or books?
[12:41:00] <gary_b> (ive very little experience)
[12:41:09] <BillCriswell> gary_b: How's your Javascript in general?
[12:41:39] <teasercss> any idea why $('body').on('click', function() { is called when I load the page and no when I click on the page ?
[12:42:10] <NoiseEee> teasercss: are you doing that before the DOM and or jquery is ready/loaded
[12:42:34] <teasercss> @NoiseEee i am doing that in $(document).ready(function() { so after
[12:43:07] <NoiseEee> teasercss: then nope, unless you have JS errors in your console etc
[12:44:11] <BillCriswell> teasercss: Are you preventing the event from bubbling up on child elements?
[12:44:31] <teasercss> @BillCriswell no
[12:44:36] <teasercss> should I ?
[12:44:47] <BillCriswell> No. Just trying to think of reasons why that would happen.
[12:46:31] <teasercss> ver simple code right here
[12:46:32] <teasercss> http://pastebin.com/YrwzQpZd
[12:46:34] <Guest87306> hello
[12:46:43] <teasercss> but it is run when I load the pge
[12:46:45] <teasercss> page
[12:47:16] <teasercss> Am I missing anything ?
[12:47:38] <BillCriswell> teasercss: Also, are you sure the body is being clicked? Are you using an empty page?
[12:48:05] <teasercss> its not an empty page
[12:48:10] <teasercss> let me try on an empty page
[12:48:51] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/evIQISA/1/edit In a situation like here, only clicking below the orange line will trigger the event.
[12:50:09] <BillCriswell> Also, it shouldn't be running online if you're just doing .on('click', whatever); you would need to do like .on('click', whatever).trigger('click') to do it without a real click.
[12:50:14] <banzounet> Hey, I'm trying to do POST CORS request with $.ajax but I'm getting "Origin ... is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin' even with Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * as header, any idea ?
[12:50:48] <wspock> Brazil?
[12:51:01] <teasercss> @BillCriswell thanks , I am sure there is a conflict with some other code then
[12:51:24] <banzounet> https://gist.github.com/BaNzounet/eec32682dbfa394f3ef0 <- my ajax call
[12:51:39] <gary_b> BillCriswell: ive very little js experience, i just hack up solutions when i need them, like hide / show div in response to button click
[12:53:47] <BillCriswell> gary_b: I'd definitely read through on JavaScript basics. From there you can move onto like http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/
[12:54:31] <gary_b> thanks
[12:54:46] <BillCriswell> gary_b: http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/jquery actually, this seems like a great approach.
[12:58:59] <Ericx2x> Anyone know how to make this blue button on this first slide go to the next slide?
[12:58:59] <Ericx2x> http://adapt2.erictheprogrammer.com/timeline.php
[13:00:54] <teasercss> @BillCriswell I still have some issue , I want to hide a div when clicking on it and show something else then when clicking anywhere else have the inverse
[13:00:56] <teasercss> @BillCriswell
[13:00:57] <teasercss> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/FcHex
[13:04:43] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12009523/flexslider-1-8-go-to-item should help
[13:06:32] <Ericx2x> BillCriswell do you know if that will work with other sliders that aren't flexslider?
[13:06:42] <Ericx2x> I'm using a slider called transbanner
[13:07:04] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: I looked at your source code and saw flexslider in there and assumed.
[13:07:25] <Ericx2x> whopse i was trying to use flex slider but removed it
[13:08:04] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: You can probably just do $('.pager a').eq(2).trigger('click') on button press. Would have to run that after the slider is set up.
[13:09:26] <Ericx2x> BillCriswell I'm not sure what that line you just wrote means
[13:09:47] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: I'm just programatically clicking the second "dot" thing in the slidershow.
[13:10:00] <Ericx2x> oh
[13:10:36] <Ericx2x> so something like this?
[13:10:38] <Ericx2x> 	$('#bluebutton').click(
[13:10:38] <Ericx2x> 		$('.pager a').eq(2).trigger('click')
[13:10:38] <Ericx2x> 		);
[13:11:33] <JmZ> how do new, empty repos get popular so quickly :/
[13:11:36] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: I'm not sure it would be that exact class. It's just pseudocode.
[13:11:53] <JmZ> just saw one which hasn't even been coded yet, its just a README and yet it has 300+ stars
[13:12:00] <Ericx2x> when you say exact class are you referring to .pager a ?
[13:12:06] <JmZ> someone somewhere is a twitter junkie me thinks
[13:12:11] <Ericx2x> .pager a is referring to the buttons?
[13:12:14] <Ericx2x> i'm sorta confused
[13:12:42] <marto> hi !
[13:12:50] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: Yes. You would need to use what your slideshow is set up to use.
[13:12:50] <tgodar> die() not core?  $(...).die is not a function
[13:12:58] <marto> need some help on jquery sortable :)
[13:13:31] <Ericx2x> BillCriswell I honestly have no clue how to find the exact class for the second or next button
[13:14:00] <jcrawford> guys how can i create a hash map with jquery or js?  I need to do something like notifications['string-1'] and notifications['string-2'] etc
[13:14:02] <marto> its working fine, however when i watn to sort en element on the right, it goes straight on the left before i can actually drop it somewhere... it works but not really nicely
[13:14:06] <jcrawford> like associative arrays in php
[13:14:20] <duch_kazatel> jcrawford what you just did is valid JS
[13:14:31] <marto> (with default options)
[13:14:34] <duch_kazatel> jcrawford that's object property access notation.
[13:14:55] <duch_kazatel> myObj.prop = 'x' is the same as myObj['prop'] = x
[13:14:59] <duch_kazatel> those are both the same thing.
[13:15:40] <fortysixandtwo> Is it not possible to do something like: var myElement = $('.my-list').find('.active') || $('.my-list').children().first() ?
[13:15:41] <duch_kazatel> javascript doesn't have "hashes" or "associative arrays", though square bracked notation is similar enough that most treat them that way.
[13:16:02] <NoiseEee> fortysixandtwo: no, because the first will *always* return a result
[13:17:04] <jcrawford> hmm
[13:17:06] <fortysixandtwo> NoiseEee: Ok.. so what's an elegant way to do it instead of if else? I might need to check a few variables and it gets messy
[13:18:26] <duch_kazatel> jcrawford the cool thing with object property access notation is anything between the brackets gets evaluated, so you can do dynamic property creation like myObj['thing' + aVar]
[13:18:43] <jcrawford> ah ok cool
[13:19:00] <NoiseEee> fortysixandtwo: you'd have to check the .length of each selector result to see if anything was actually found
[13:19:27] <duch_kazatel> fortysixandtwo when you say "elegant" do you mean "short"?  or "without an if/else check"?
[13:19:50] <marto> ok, bootstrap messing.
[13:19:55] <duch_kazatel> 'cause there's always https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Conditional_Operator
[13:19:58] <fortysixandtwo> duch_kazatel: shorter than if else :)
[13:20:14] <Z3R0>  I know this is probably stupid but I have followed this verbatim and I can't replicate it: http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-style
[13:20:19] <fortysixandtwo> duch_kazatel: Yea, that's what i ended up doing
[13:20:20] <jcrawford> ok well on click of one element i am setting notifications[element_key] = true, on click of another element I am alerting the notifications[element_key] and it is undefined.  I have put an alert before and after setting it to true so why is it coming back as undefined?
[13:20:37] <fortysixandtwo> clean enough i guess
[13:20:40] <duch_kazatel> jcrawford i'd need to see some code in a fiddle.
[13:21:09] <duch_kazatel> something tells me element_key is not getting set the way you think it is perhaps.
[13:21:17] <jcrawford> i'll prep something
[13:24:03] <jcrawford> ohhh i got it, nevermind and ty
[13:24:09] <duch_kazatel> np.
[13:36:27] <Paul_B_Hartzog> is there an IRC channel for jquery work? like #drupal-consultants does for drupal work.
[13:37:36] <duch_kazatel> Paul_B_Hartzog you can search by running /list *jquery*
[13:37:41] <duch_kazatel> asterisks are wildcards.
[13:38:06] <Paul_B_Hartzog> thx. done.
[13:39:18] <Paul_B_Hartzog> lol, that /list search didn't even turn up THIS channel
[13:39:27] <Paul_B_Hartzog> and this is the jquery room
[13:40:00] <duch_kazatel> worked for me.
[13:40:08] <jedimind> Paul_B_Hartzog do you need to hire someone? or are you looking to get hired
[13:41:42] <Paul_B_Hartzog> I'm available.
[13:41:46] <Paul_B_Hartzog> not hiring
[13:42:39] <jedimind> portfolio?
[13:44:19] <Paul_B_Hartzog> just a long list of consulting clients, mostly university work
[13:44:28] <Paul_B_Hartzog> Stanford, MIT, UMich, etc
[13:44:42] <Paul_B_Hartzog> ran my own company for a few years.  now I freelance.
[13:45:53] <Paul_B_Hartzog> resume is here: http://paulbhartzog.org/code/
[13:46:18] <duch_kazatel> are you looking to freelance or get hired somewhere?
[13:47:01] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i mostly work from home for medical reasons and I can't relocate my fam, so freelance is best unless I get hired locally
[13:47:08] <Paul_B_Hartzog> thx for talking btw :-)
[13:47:16] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:47:21] <Paul_B_Hartzog> I'm open to suggestions.  elance?
[13:47:31] <traets> I have an $.ajax call inside function foo()... how can  i make foo() return true when ajax succeeds? if i do return true inside the ajax callback, it's not foo() thats returning true
[13:47:49] <duch_kazatel> no ideas personally.
[13:48:09] <Paul_B_Hartzog> traets, can you use the ajax success to toggle a var inside foo() ?
[13:48:33] <jedimind> Paul_B_Hartzog deskribed.com is pretty good but more for fulltime/contract placements
[13:48:47] <traets> Paul_B_Hartzog: Sure. But i was wondering if there's  a more  convenient or accepted way.
[13:48:53] <Paul_B_Hartzog> ah
[13:49:05] <jedimind> freelance wise, elance, scriptlance
[13:49:19] <jedimind> there are a number of crowd sourcing places as well out there
[13:49:33] <jedimind> i would work on a portfolio though if i were you
[13:49:46] <NoiseEee> traets: no, because the function is going to return a value immediately, before the XHR has been received/processed
[13:49:49] <jedimind> showcasing completed projects and your involvement, rather than individual technical challenges
[13:50:15] <Paul_B_Hartzog> yeah, the portfolio thing hurts me because my work was either 1) private, or 2) no longer online
[13:50:27] <Paul_B_Hartzog> so it's on the resume, but I can't link to it
[13:50:29] <Paul_B_Hartzog> :-/
[13:50:34] <jedimind> Paul_B_Hartzog i know its rough, i always recommend to students to work on mini startups
[13:50:34] <duch_kazatel> also Paul_B_Hartzog your resume is too long.
[13:50:37] <traets> NoiseEee: YEP. THANKS
[13:50:37] <duch_kazatel> and has too much.
[13:50:38] <jedimind> like week long MVP ideas
[13:50:47] <jedimind> build out a basic web service in a week
[13:50:50] <Paul_B_Hartzog> too long?  do tell
[13:50:56] <jedimind> take it from concept to completion and have it to show off
[13:51:06] <jedimind> some simple social aggregator or something basic
[13:51:22] <duch_kazatel> imo resumes should be 1-2 pages and be short and sweet.
[13:51:42] <jedimind> yeah, your resume should be a single page, and less focus on "i have a MS in this" and more focus on "i took this brand or this product from 1 user to 103925809283059820395 concurrent muffins"
[13:51:43] <jedimind> or whatever
[13:51:48] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[13:51:54] <jedimind> http://www.pud.ca/andrej_simeonov_resume.pdf
[13:51:56] <jedimind> thats my resume
[13:51:57] <duch_kazatel> list the most recent 5 places your worked at or so.
[13:52:03] <Paul_B_Hartzog> I'm over 40 and have done a lot of major stuff
[13:52:21] <jedimind> tahts fine, but its not necessarily relevant any more, i built my first client website in 1996
[13:52:26] <jedimind> i have done a TON more than what is on my resume
[13:52:28] <Paul_B_Hartzog> it's interesting that your focus suggestion is business-related
[13:52:40] <Paul_B_Hartzog> all of my work is either non-profit or university
[13:52:42] <jedimind> but whats on there is relevant and current
[13:52:43] <Paul_B_Hartzog> not business
[13:52:54] <Paul_B_Hartzog> I'll need to work on these things
[13:52:57] <jedimind> Paul_B_Hartzog it doesnt matter, it still has tangible metrics as a result of your work
[13:52:57] <Paul_B_Hartzog> thx
[13:53:03] <duch_kazatel> and that's fine, but you need to sell yourself.
[13:53:05] <jedimind> "now students can use it twice as fast"
[13:53:10] <jedimind> or whatever
[13:53:13] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[13:53:34] <jedimind> my work happens to take place with agencies a lot where the focus is conversion and profit margins
[13:53:43] <jedimind> which are the metrics i focus on, but any work has tangible metrics you can showcase
[13:53:55] <duch_kazatel> also: think about it this way - you're a hiring manager sitting in front of a stack of resumes.  which ones are you going to read?  the ones that are packed full or words?  or the ones that get straight to the point?
[13:53:59] <Paul_B_Hartzog> yeah, i'll need to think about the language.  how to show the benefit i accomplished for the client.
[13:54:04] <Paul_B_Hartzog> makes sense
[13:54:21] <jedimind> but i still maintain that a solid portfolio is better anyway
[13:54:23] <duch_kazatel> check out resume guides - there are plenty of formats out there to highlight different things.
[13:54:24] <jedimind> especially for freelance
[13:54:34] <jedimind> resume is better when youre looking to get hired full time
[13:54:37] <duch_kazatel> yeah a really good portfolio is always the best thing.  github.,
[13:54:43] <jedimind> it has almost no place in a freelance environment
[13:56:23] <Paul_B_Hartzog> this is helpful.  so what kind of portfolio can i have if the work is all not visible or no longer visible
[13:56:39] <jedimind> Paul_B_Hartzog you can have open source contributions to projects in github
[13:56:46] <jedimind> you can create your own mini open source projects and host them on github
[13:56:56] <jedimind> you can create your own micro web services that you can build in like a week
[13:57:05] <jedimind> and host them / make a little brand for them and put them in your portfolio
[13:57:06] <Paul_B_Hartzog> do tell
[13:57:11] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i do that sort of stuff for fun
[13:57:19] <Paul_B_Hartzog> but i don't usually put it out there for everyone
[13:57:19] <jedimind> put all of it on github and create public repositories
[13:57:34] <jedimind> as someone who hires freelancers, thats the first thing i look at
[13:57:39] <Paul_B_Hartzog> for example several sites use my web engine
[13:57:41] <jedimind> i want to see the person's code
[13:57:54] <jedimind> but i also want to know that they have enough focus to work on an open source project
[13:57:58] <jedimind> or launch something of their own
[13:57:58] <Paul_B_Hartzog> yeah, you are getting me thinking
[13:58:00] <jedimind> no matter how small
[13:58:17] <jedimind> there are a ton of developers out there that are exceptionally talented and can debug any crazy thing you throw at them
[13:58:21] <jedimind> but they cant focus for more than 3 days at a time
[13:58:26] <jedimind> and cannot build anything beginning to end
[13:58:33] <Paul_B_Hartzog> 3 days?  more like an hour ;-)
[13:58:41] <Paul_B_Hartzog> and yes, I have a lot of stuff "in progress"
[13:58:43] <jedimind> yeah, or 10 minutes :)
[13:58:50] <Paul_B_Hartzog> that's why I work better with a boss
[13:58:54] <Paul_B_Hartzog> I'm a lousy boss
[13:58:56] <Paul_B_Hartzog> :-D
[13:59:00] <Z3R0> anyone able to help with something like this: http://jqueryui.com/tooltip/#custom-style // it's not working :( and I can't tell if maybe I did something wrong, but I did it verbatim...
[13:59:16] <Z3R0> trying to get code up now
[13:59:57] <jedimind> Paul_B_Hartzog yeah, its tough, but its a good selling feature
[14:00:06] <jedimind> i will hire a developer with half the skills if i know for a fact i dont have to babysit them
[14:00:13] <jedimind> over a superstar developer who i have to hound daily
[14:00:28] <Paul_B_Hartzog> well, words like "babysit" and "hound" are loaded
[14:00:36] <Paul_B_Hartzog> communication keeps things on track
[14:00:37] <Paul_B_Hartzog> agile
[14:00:40] <jedimind> they are rather exageratted of course
[14:00:44] <Paul_B_Hartzog> it's better method than 'go do it'
[14:00:45] <Paul_B_Hartzog> mo
[14:00:48] <Paul_B_Hartzog> er, imo
[14:00:54] <jedimind> sure, but as a freelancer, youre more often asked to "go do it"
[14:00:59] <jedimind> than be part of a collaborative team
[14:01:03] <jedimind> thats what in house developers are for
[14:01:27] <Paul_B_Hartzog> that's an interesting observation.  if true, it would explain a lot
[14:01:40] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i work best on collaborative non in-house teams
[14:01:51] <jedimind> those are a bit of a pink unicorn in the industry
[14:02:08] <Paul_B_Hartzog> could be. as a futurist, i would say that's an economic flaw
[14:02:10] <duch_kazatel> you hire a freelancer when you needs something banged out fast.
[14:02:22] <Paul_B_Hartzog> you guys are really helping me out here.  thx.
[14:02:32] <jedimind> no problem, we've all been there :)
[14:02:57] <Paul_B_Hartzog> see, my main client is a long-term relationship where i 'freelance' but we communicate a lot
[14:03:07] <Paul_B_Hartzog> but the work is slow for that client right now
[14:03:11] <duch_kazatel> yeah, definitely.  i really wish somebody had told me what I was doing wrong years ago.
[14:03:13] <Paul_B_Hartzog> but i like that kind of relationship
[14:03:29] <Paul_B_Hartzog> so pink unicorns are my strong suit ;-)
[14:03:34] <jedimind> ive had a few developers work for me where that has been the case
[14:03:46] <jedimind> but like duch_kazatel  said, more often than not i will hire a freelancer when i dont have time to deal with something myself
[14:03:50] <jedimind> and therefore want to be relatively hands off
[14:03:59] <jedimind> on the other hand, i will hire contracted developers when i need more involvement
[14:03:59] <Paul_B_Hartzog> good point
[14:04:08] <jedimind> usually on the basis of a time box
[14:04:11] <jedimind> 20hours a week for 3 months
[14:04:14] <jedimind> or something to that effect
[14:04:21] <duch_kazatel> Yeah Paul_B_Hartzog if you want more communication check out doing contracting for smaller startups.
[14:04:32] <duch_kazatel> some of those places like to stay in touch.
[14:04:36] <jedimind> Paul_B_Hartzog where are you located geographically ?
[14:04:52] <jedimind> i know in my area there are a ton of agencies and a ton of recruiters that constantly hire people for 1-4 month long contracts
[14:04:57] <jedimind> to work in house for $50-100/hr
[14:05:08] <jedimind> those types of offers i get hounded with on a daily basis
[14:05:24] <talntid> you are turning down 100/hr jobs?
[14:05:38] <Paul_B_Hartzog> send 'em to me :-)
[14:05:43] <Paul_B_Hartzog> I'm in Asheville
[14:05:45] <Paul_B_Hartzog> NC
[14:05:50] <jedimind> talntid yeah, they're not that uncommon
[14:06:03] <jedimind> i mean i have like a 150k+bonuses full time gig where i have zero overtime
[14:06:05] <duch_kazatel> Paul_B_Hartzog have you considered working for a newspaper?
[14:06:05] <jedimind> and am cushy
[14:06:17] <jedimind> so i dont really need the 60-80hr week crunch time from agencies
[14:06:22] <jedimind> even if it is 100/hr
[14:06:24] <Paul_B_Hartzog> "doing contracting for smaller startups." where do i look for that?
[14:06:25] <talntid> i do too
[14:06:28] <jedimind> (although i normally bill at 150/hr)
[14:06:30] <Paul_B_Hartzog> or newspapers
[14:06:47] <jedimind> http://jobs.jsninja.com/a/jbb/find-jobs @ Paul_B_Hartzog
[14:07:07] <jcrawford> i hate that hiring managers look for oss contributions or personal projects.  In my personal time i would rather spend it with my kids/wife than working on something else outside of work hours
[14:07:24] <Paul_B_Hartzog> same here
[14:07:25] <jedimind> jcrawford thats the switch ive made recently
[14:07:28] <nhqe> jcrawford: it shows dedication to the craft
[14:07:29] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i have 2 kids
[14:07:33] <jedimind> i value my personal life
[14:07:34] <jcrawford> that's the only thing I don't like lol i am a big family person so working outside of work on personal stuff is very very limited
[14:07:42] <jedimind> i dont have kids, but i have skiing and biking and my girlfriend
[14:07:48] <jcrawford> nhqe: yea and negligence of your family/kids :)
[14:07:50] <jedimind> and all of taht type of fun stuff ;)
[14:07:50] <Paul_B_Hartzog> but then, i work on programming projecsts with my kids
[14:07:54] <nhqe> not necessarily
[14:07:56] <Paul_B_Hartzog> my kids program
[14:08:07] <jcrawford> jedimind: hobbies are not as demanding as kids/wife lol i know trust me :)
[14:08:09] <nhqe> if you can't balance kids and what you love then that's not the employers problem
[14:08:12] <talntid> heh, because i value my personal life, i come on irc to give out contracting jobs, but i have found that most ircers are terrible at negotiating
[14:08:33] <jcrawford> Paul_B_Hartzog: i can't wait till mine get interested, i've tried already at 6-8-10 but none are interested in learning programming just yet
[14:08:35] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i'm here. let's talk :-)
[14:09:13] <jedimind> talntid $15,000 before i even look at the spec
[14:09:14] <jedimind> thank you
[14:09:24] <talntid> pretty much, lol
[14:09:35] <jcrawford> nhqe: i didn't say it was the employers problem, what i don't like is that they expect you to have all these personal projects or oss contributions.  I am balancing my work/family life just fine, but I don;t do a lot of personal work as I would rather be with my family
[14:09:57] <talntid> "please send via overnight mail, the last 4 years of bank statements showing you carry a positive balance of at least 20 million. then, I'll talk to you. kthx"
[14:10:12] <jcrawford> hahaha
[14:10:31] <Paul_B_Hartzog> not in this economy
[14:10:32] <talntid> "otherwise, you can't afford me for the 10 hour project you need!"
[14:10:34] <jedimind> talntid yeah totally
[14:10:44] <jedimind> Paul_B_Hartzog the economy in this industry is totally fine
[14:10:50] <jedimind> its just your silly country thats messed up :)
[14:11:09] <Paul_B_Hartzog> what country are you in?
[14:11:09] <talntid> yeah, I'm doing fine in this economy too
[14:11:14] <nhqe> jcrawford: then be with your family :)
[14:11:28] <duch_kazatel> this in this country, IT work is just fine in this economy as far as I've seen.
[14:11:31] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i'll work for anyone, doesn't have to be u.s. of a.
[14:11:32] <jedimind> canada
[14:11:43] <Soopaman> talntid: "but I'm doing you a huge favor by hiring you and helping you build your skillset"
[14:11:49] <duch_kazatel> lols
[14:11:59] <duch_kazatel> so glad there's nobody like that where I lvie.
[14:12:02] <duch_kazatel> *live
[14:12:03] <jcrawford> nhqe: i just don't see how employers can hold that against a candidate, if they are performing at work then that's all that should be required, they shouldn't require you to invest all this other personal time on other projects, that was only the point i was making :)
[14:12:09] <jedimind> duch_kazatel dutch?
[14:12:22] <nhqe> jcrawford: but personal projects help you explore different avenues
[14:12:24] <jedimind> oh no, oregon
[14:12:35] <duch_kazatel> no.
[14:12:36] <duch_kazatel> ca
[14:12:36] <Paul_B_Hartzog> my situation is odd in that as a futurist i know where technology/the-world is headed so I'm more of a 'big picture' guy.  i code because I can see that future.
[14:12:37] <nhqe> it shows initiative and passion for the work
[14:12:37] <jedimind> chico,
[14:12:39] <jedimind> yeah
[14:12:40] <talntid> also, contractors seem to not want to make sign-up forms for me. lol
[14:12:41] <Soopaman> I personally don't do resume's or portfolios anymore
[14:12:42] <duch_kazatel> Yeah.
[14:12:44] <jedimind> sorry misread the thingy
[14:12:46] <duch_kazatel> northern california.
[14:12:47] <duch_kazatel> it's cool ;)
[14:12:48] <jcrawford> nhqe: so does working at an employer who allows you to have r&d and supports the use of new technologies, etc
[14:12:54] <nhqe> definitely
[14:13:02] <talntid> sign-up forms are "below" many people
[14:13:04] <jedimind> heh i bet i could have half the americans in this channel pissed off at me
[14:13:07] <jedimind> with one statement
[14:13:11] <jcrawford> nhqe: so your saying the employer wants you to continue learning everything you need to know on your own time rather than having you learn on the job :) hmmm
[14:13:13] <talntid> ooh do tell
[14:13:14] <Soopaman> get on the phone/in the same room as whomever you might be working with, and have a conversation
[14:13:21] <Paul_B_Hartzog> jedimind, go for it :-)
[14:13:24] <jedimind> i built the COX website
[14:13:25] <jedimind> haha
[14:13:28] <duch_kazatel> jedimind woah!
[14:13:35] <duch_kazatel> no shit!  I used to work with Cox.
[14:13:36] <jedimind> and all its admin / client panels
[14:13:48] <jedimind> i hand coded like 80% of that html/css/js myself
[14:13:48] <duch_kazatel> Ever heard of a company called Travidia?
[14:13:59] <jedimind> it rings a bell
[14:14:04] <jedimind> we were hired to design + build the front end
[14:14:09] <jedimind> over the span of like a year and a bit
[14:14:23] <jedimind> i flew to alpharetta georgia 27 times in ~6 months
[14:14:24] <duch_kazatel> I was there when the Cox contracts came through.
[14:14:30] <jedimind> because they wanted every single fucking meeting to hapen in person
[14:14:33] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[14:14:37] <jedimind> they had a $650,000 budget for travel
[14:14:42] <duch_kazatel> they always wanted phone calls with us.
[14:14:44] <duch_kazatel> holy shit.
[14:14:58] <jedimind> i remember once we showed them designs, final ones for a section, and their only feedback was adjusting the placement of a handful of buttons
[14:15:00] <duch_kazatel> wow they didn't try to dick you like they did us.
[14:15:01] <jedimind> so we flew back to toronto
[14:15:05] <jedimind> moved the buttons 10pixels
[14:15:07] <jedimind> printed it
[14:15:08] <nhqe> sounds like a great client jedimind
[14:15:09] <jedimind> and flew back in 2 days
[14:15:12] <Paul_B_Hartzog> yeah, lucky
[14:15:17] <talntid> i'm currently trying to hire a local dev to do just front-end work... just design, html, css and JS..
[14:15:19] <jedimind> the entire contract was like $6.5mil
[14:15:21] <talntid> seems to be an impossible find
[14:15:26] <nhqe> I wish I knew JS
[14:15:29] <nhqe> just html and CSS
[14:15:35] <nhqe> I can't seem to pick up programming
[14:15:36] <jedimind> talntid does it have to be local?
[14:15:42] <talntid> jedimind, yeah
[14:15:51] <jedimind> local to? washington ?
[14:15:56] <talntid> yes, spokane WA
[14:16:27] <talntid> you've seen themeforest? the web templates people put on there? I want someone who can build that kind of stuff.
[14:16:34] <jedimind> yeah thats easy
[14:16:35] <talntid> no back-end anything... purely front-end
[14:16:42] <talntid> it's not easy for many people
[14:16:45] <ShinyObjects> talntid: I'm from Spokane. Want me to see if anyone I know is looking?
[14:16:54] <talntid> yes, ShinyObjects
[14:16:59] <jedimind> i would charge a hefty premium for moving to the states
[14:17:00] <jedimind> :)
[14:17:07] <nhqe> jedimind:  how old are you?
[14:17:17] <ShinyObjects> PM me your info as far as qualifications needed, e-mail address they should drop you a line at
[14:17:25] <Z3R0> god dammit... gotta love when you go to show something on fiddle it works fine, but does not work on your damn localhost
[14:17:30] <jedimind> 32
[14:17:41] <jedimind> Z3R0 probably because youre not running it through a webserver
[14:17:50] <jedimind> Z3R0 js executes differently when you're just viewing file/// something
[14:17:50] <Z3R0> yes I am... lol
[14:18:14] <Z3R0> everything works fine except the styling of the tooltip for jquery-ui
[14:18:16] <Paul_B_Hartzog> browsers use different restrictions for localhost
[14:18:19] <Soopaman> heheh
[14:18:22] <Z3R0> but soon as I loaded it in fiddle it worked fine
[14:18:24] <Paul_B_Hartzog> depending on what you are doing
[14:18:32] <Z3R0> just styling a tooltip
[14:18:34] <jedimind> talntid you need someone to do design/layout too?
[14:18:36] <jedimind> or just code them
[14:18:39] <nhqe> jedimind: and you just work purely front end?
[14:18:43] <talntid> I want someone to do it all.
[14:18:43] <nhqe> css html js?
[14:18:46] <Z3R0> http://jsfiddle.net/A8PPz/
[14:18:49] <Z3R0> that's what I was working on
[14:18:50] <talntid> design/layout/html/css/js
[14:18:57] <jedimind> nhqe yeah, in terms of my immediate skills, yes
[14:19:01] <jedimind> nhqe but im also a tech lead / manager
[14:19:06] <talntid> basically, I develop the back-end systems, and expose an API
[14:19:08] <nhqe> ah
[14:19:17] <Z3R0> works fine in fiddle, but fails in my localhost... I think it might be the third party ToC script I have though
[14:19:25] <jedimind> im whats called a technical experience director
[14:19:25] <Z3R0> because I didn't load that in fiddle
[14:19:36] <nhqe> jedimind: job titles are really overblown nowadays
[14:19:42] <jedimind> nhqe i dont disagree
[14:19:43] <duch_kazatel> depending.
[14:19:46] <Z3R0> going to remove that locally and see if it fails or not
[14:19:47] <jedimind> but i get to sound fancy at parties
[14:19:52] <nhqe> ;)
[14:20:01] <nhqe> I desperately need to learn JS
[14:20:03] <nhqe> gah
[14:20:21] <duch_kazatel> nhqe what's stopping you?
[14:20:34] <duch_kazatel> you know HTML and CSS which is a good step in the right directly.
[14:20:35] <nhqe> duch_kazatel: no immediate projects to work on, difficulty programming in general
[14:20:38] <duch_kazatel> *direction
[14:20:41] <Z3R0> wtf...... lmao
[14:20:46] <Z3R0> hmmm now I am really confused
[14:20:57] <nhqe> yeah.. HTML and CSS I know but JS has just always eluded me
[14:21:02] <nhqe> I tried python.. ruby.. java..
[14:21:04] <nhqe> nothing sinks
[14:21:05] <plambwk> my title is Legendary Chief Experience Human Interface Engineer Designer Architect
[14:21:31] <jedimind> talntid i have a few guys at my disposal who can do that but not local if other things dont pan out
[14:21:33] <duch_kazatel> nhqe i was the same way for years.  how old are you?
[14:21:36] <Z3R0> ooooooo
[14:21:39] <Z3R0> found the culprit!
[14:21:41] <nhqe> 23 :/
[14:21:44] <Z3R0> bootstrap....
[14:21:48] <jedimind> goddamn bootstrap
[14:21:51] * jedimind shakes a fist
[14:21:52] <Paul_B_Hartzog> do tell
[14:21:56] <duch_kazatel> nhqe you got some times.
[14:22:00] <duch_kazatel> *time
[14:22:11] <duch_kazatel> but get on that.
[14:22:19] <duch_kazatel> start building shit.
[14:22:27] <jedimind> i need a nodejs person
[14:22:31] <jedimind> or a python person
[14:22:37] <jedimind> talntid wanna barder ?
[14:22:37] <jedimind> :)
[14:22:39] <Paul_B_Hartzog> i've done both of those
[14:22:42] <duch_kazatel> hah
[14:22:47] <Z3R0> now to figure out wtf bootstrap did to fuck it up
[14:22:50] <Paul_B_Hartzog> python web or python local?
[14:22:58] <jedimind> python web - django-like
[14:23:05] <nhqe> duch_kazatel: I understand loops, functions, variables, scope etc etc
[14:23:12] <nhqe> but I have trouble actually *building*
[14:23:14] <jedimind> scope has no place in javascript!
[14:23:15] * jedimind ducks
[14:23:20] <duch_kazatel> LOL
[14:23:21] <Paul_B_Hartzog> yeah, django is pretty good
[14:23:31] <Soopaman> ugh node...
[14:23:34] <duch_kazatel> and nhqe you just need to make a project.
[14:23:48] <nhqe> in JS though?
[14:23:55] <nhqe> would I need to use backbone/ember/angular
[14:23:55] <duch_kazatel> i hate designing ideas.  but give me a project and I can rock the hell out of it.
[14:23:58] <jedimind> i lost a window
[14:23:59] <duch_kazatel> nah.
[14:24:04] <jedimind> its somewhere on one of the 3 monitors
[14:24:05] <duch_kazatel> do a webpage.
[14:24:06] <jedimind> but i cant find it
[14:24:08] <traets> Paul_B_Hartzog: Actually i cant do that.
[14:24:12] <duch_kazatel> jedimind I used to have that problem.
[14:24:17] <traets> if i set the variable on the callback, the script will have kept going
[14:24:19] <nhqe> what kind of webpage though?
[14:24:21] <duch_kazatel> I rocked a quad monitor setup at one point.
[14:24:26] <Soopaman> the only good thing about about node is using the jq lib to scrape/manipulate sites
[14:24:28] <jedimind> its just too much
[14:24:32] <jedimind> 27" imac + 2 thunderbolt
[14:24:33] <Soopaman> otherwise I dislike it greately
[14:24:46] <Soopaman> greatly*
[14:24:47] <duch_kazatel> nhqe anything. make an RSS reader that pull from a bunch of feeds.
[14:24:59] <nhqe> using JS?
[14:25:04] <duch_kazatel> yeah
[14:25:10] <nhqe> didn't even know that was possible
[14:25:12] <Soopaman> 'use strict';
[14:25:16] <Soopaman> then go forth
[14:25:21] <duch_kazatel> yup.
[14:25:22] <duch_kazatel> ajax :)
[14:25:30] <duch_kazatel> at least, that'd be one way to do it.
[14:25:41] <nhqe> I'll take a look at that tomorrow at work, I get frustrated real easy haha
[14:25:57] <duch_kazatel> of course.  you'd be surprised through.
[14:26:01] <duch_kazatel> it'll click.
[14:27:22] <sacho> scope, the final frontier
[14:27:35] <Soopaman> heh
[14:27:35] <nhqe> I do enjoy doing little things with programming, which is a bonus
[14:27:42] <Soopaman> callbacks = black holes/
[14:27:47] <nhqe> and JS would fit hand in hand with html and css.
[14:28:17] <duch_kazatel> YUP
[14:28:32] <Z3R0> grrrrrr this sucks
[14:28:39] <nhqe> so many guys my age are landing nice salaries just doing front end dev
[14:28:53] <duch_kazatel> nhqe what area are you in?
[14:29:00] <nhqe> I live rural, UK
[14:29:05] <nhqe> so my options are limited
[14:29:05] <duch_kazatel> ah
[14:29:08] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[14:29:09] <Denommus> nhqe: how old are you?
[14:29:11] <nhqe> I want to move to the city but.. money
[14:29:18] <nhqe> I'm 23 Denommus
[14:29:22] <Z3R0> so either i use bs and screw my tooltips or remove bs... :(
[14:29:41] <duch_kazatel> Z3R0 what are you using BS for
[14:29:43] <duch_kazatel> ?
[14:30:05] <Z3R0> lazy styling cuz i suck with html / css
[14:30:11] <duch_kazatel> hah
[14:30:20] <duch_kazatel> BS should have native tooltips.
[14:30:32] <Z3R0> o.o
[14:30:57] <duch_kazatel> this is close enough http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tooltips
[14:32:15] <nhqe> bootstrap is in my nightmares
[14:32:19] <nhqe> can't believe I almost used it once :(
[14:32:42] <duch_kazatel> i worked at a place that used it.  it's great until you want to leave the designated fun zone.
[14:33:08] <Z3R0> dammit to all living hell
[14:33:11] <Z3R0> who just showed me that ?
[14:33:21] <duch_kazatel> showed you waht?
[14:33:27] <duch_kazatel> the tooltips?
[14:33:29] <Z3R0> bs tooltips
[14:33:32] <nhqe> lol
[14:33:33] <duch_kazatel> Me.
[14:33:38] <Z3R0> god damn you
[14:34:07] <Z3R0> so I spent the last 2-3 hours on these damn jquery ui tooltips when BS did it
[14:34:10] <duch_kazatel> lol
[14:34:35] <Z3R0> wtf
[14:34:38] <Z3R0> bs does tabs too ?
[14:34:41] <duch_kazatel> yeah.
[14:34:44] <duch_kazatel> it does everything.
[14:34:48] <Z3R0> fuck my fucking shit fuck
[14:34:52] <nhqe> literally
[14:34:55] <duch_kazatel> grid, buttons, icons.
[14:35:01] <nhqe> duch_kazatel: have you tried Mixture?
[14:35:02] <duch_kazatel> but don't try to change any of it.
[14:35:04] <Z3R0> ok so basically, I need to just use bs, and remove the other stuff
[14:35:05] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[14:35:12] <nhqe> check it out :)
[14:35:18] <nhqe> http://mixture.io
[14:35:28] <duch_kazatel> yeah looking.
[14:35:46] <duch_kazatel> oooh. simple static site generation.
[14:36:42] <nhqe> it's brilliant
[14:36:48] <nhqe> sped up my workflow tenfold
[14:36:52] <nhqe> liquid markup is a godsend too
[14:36:58] <Z3R0> so now, time to fix my stuff and just use bs's
[14:37:05] <nhqe> plus they've just added support for github pages
[14:37:10] <nhqe> so inbuilt push
[14:38:07] <Z3R0> god that really pisses me off
[14:38:09] <duch_kazatel> call me crazy - I like HTMl.
[14:38:11] <duch_kazatel> *HTML
[14:38:17] <duch_kazatel> and Z3R0 we've all been there.
[14:38:28] <Z3R0> so basically I was making it harder on myself ?
[14:38:42] <duch_kazatel> Z3R0 welcome to programming.
[14:38:47] <Z3R0> lol
[14:38:54] <Z3R0> I've reinvented the wheel several times ;)
[14:39:37] <Z3R0> so now I just gotta style everything according to BS's method not jquery-ui's
[14:39:54] <duch_kazatel> oh, yeah
[14:43:24] <snkcld> given 2 arrays, how do i tell if any element in the first is also in the second?
[14:44:18] <duch_kazatel> snkcld do you need to support all major browsers?
[14:44:24] <snkcld> no
[14:44:46] <duch_kazatel> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf
[14:45:19] <snkcld> ah, so just for loop over the first, calling indexOf on the second
[14:45:39] <duch_kazatel> yeah.  if you need wider support, you have to loop over the first, then loop over the second on each iteration.
[14:45:40] <snkcld> thats what i was thinking, was just wondering if there was some $.innerJoin() or something, which may have been more convenient
[14:46:02] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.inArray/
[14:46:13] <duch_kazatel> that too.
[14:47:01] <Paul_B_Hartzog> gotta bail, ciao.  thx for all the help today. :-)
[14:47:19] <duch_kazatel> our pleasure, cap'n
[14:48:51] <Z3R0> btw duch_kazatel, thank you, and I hate you
[14:49:21] <duch_kazatel> haha it's all good man.
[14:49:24] <ddww> hey
[14:49:40] <ddww> anyone have advice for smooth scrolling down to an anchor?
[14:49:57] <duch_kazatel> animate scrolling.
[14:50:13] <Z3R0> does bs come with that too ?
[14:50:14] <Z3R0> ^^
[14:50:21] <ddww> yeah, I'm using bootstrap 3
[14:50:30] <Z3R0> because I will be doing ALOT of anchor linking
[14:50:37] <duch_kazatel> jquery has it.
[14:50:42] <duch_kazatel> which is in bootstrap.
[14:51:15] <Z3R0> I'm still REALLY pissed the fuck off right now
[14:51:30] <duch_kazatel> whyfor?
[14:51:39] <Z3R0> because I spent 2-3 hours on nothing
[14:51:57] <duch_kazatel> nah it's cool man.
[14:52:12] <duch_kazatel> I just spent 2 days speccing out a potential project.
[14:52:16] <duch_kazatel> not eve sure if we'll do it.
[14:52:59] <Z3R0> oh snap
[14:53:00] <Ericx2x> Hey guys, can someone help me with this JSFiddle? I'm trying to get it so when you scroll down the image fades in like the images on http://adayinbigdata.com do.
[14:53:02] <Ericx2x> http://jsfiddle.net/db2Lf/1/
[14:53:04] <Z3R0> so the only thing I was missing was a data-toggle
[14:53:17] <grafi> what kind of project duch_kazatel :P
[14:53:58] <ddww> got it
[14:53:59] <ddww> http://css-tricks.com/snippets/jquery/smooth-scrolling/
[14:54:07] <ddww> answer in case anyone else is curious
[14:54:14] <Z3R0> thank you kindly ;)
[14:54:29] <Z3R0> oooo love that ;)
[14:54:31] <duch_kazatel> grafi in this paticular case, I cannot tell you ;)
[14:54:35] <duch_kazatel> industry secret stuff.
[14:54:38] <ddww> Z3R0: that's the deal. sometimes things take a while
[14:54:48] <ddww> we've all been there
[14:54:49] <ddww> :)
[14:54:59] <Z3R0> yea my only problem is I don't have a while
[14:55:07] <duch_kazatel> what do you mean?
[14:55:12] <ddww> if you're working on something that matters, you never will
[14:55:24] <Z3R0> well it matters... but it matters for legality
[14:55:36] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[14:55:40] <Z3R0> what I am working on ;)
[14:56:17] <Z3R0> they don't want it hard copy so they want it local intranet... but that means, I have to have it ready to rock soon as the hard copy would be finished
[14:56:19] <grafi> duch_kazatel he :P
[14:57:03] <Z3R0> oh which REMINDS me
[14:57:07] <Z3R0> any tips on preventing right click ?
[14:57:47] <duch_kazatel> Z3R0 you don't.
[14:57:59] <duch_kazatel> why in the world would you do that?
[14:58:46] <duch_kazatel> I mean, people do it, but it's not going to prevent people from doing anything.
[14:59:29] <grafi> Ericx2x just look at the source code why dont you? the page uses tweenlite and jquery waypoints
[15:00:14] <falconfox> I'm very inexperienced with JS and am hoping someone with more experience can help me. I'm using Symfony's PHP framework, and am trying to use a JS script to dynamically add a collection of forms. My JS code works great when the form only has a single collection, however, all hell breaks loose when i try to include two JS scripts, (which each work work out individually). Can someone please
[15:00:14] <falconfox> help? http://pastebin.com/geYD5MfT
[15:00:50] <falconfox> BAsically, what happens when I try to have 2 collections, is that i get duplicate "add" and "delete" buttons on 1 collection, and no "add" / "delete" buttons on the other collection
[15:01:08] <duch_kazatel> falconfox why not abstract out and write one set of JS code to handle all cases?
[15:01:14] <falconfox> I am wondering if it has something to do with the: collectionHolder.find('li')... portion of the code
[15:01:14] <duch_kazatel> (I didn't really look at your current stuff tbh)
[15:01:34] <falconfox> duch_kazatel: i would love to do that
[15:02:09] <falconfox> i just don't really have any experience with JS, was hoping that it would be a quick code tweak
[15:03:42] <falconfox> duch_kazatel: are you familiary with symfony?
[15:03:48] <duch_kazatel> not really, no.
[15:03:58] <duch_kazatel> sorry, was just providing a direction to go in.
[15:04:06] <duch_kazatel> not able to help much in depth right now :)
[15:04:38] <falconfox> duch_kazatel: no problem. i just know i have a JS problem and thought that someone might know what to do
[15:04:58] <duch_kazatel> somebody else should come along eventually :)
[15:05:16] <falconfox> cool, yeah people on IRC are generally extremely helpful
[15:07:36] <SoulBlade> hey guys - just trying to learn some stuff... looking @ the raw source in github, the top of every file has define([...]) - this is part of AMD it seems.. but what is responsible for injecting this define function in the global scope as part of the build system? bower?
[15:11:11] <ddww> oh geez
[15:11:26] <ddww> now my animate scroll is conflicting with my carousel
[15:24:34] <snkcld> is it possible to store data-blah attributes as integers?
[15:24:51] <snkcld> it seems that when i have data-foo=5 set, $.attr('data-foo') retrurns string "5"
[15:25:51] <sacho> why are you using .attr for this
[15:26:53] <sacho> snkcld, http://jsfiddle.net/VV6sB/2/
[15:39:05] <snkcld> ah, looks like the result of my API call is returning every field as a string, which is why i am seeing the attributes as strings ;(
[15:43:47] <snkcld> actually, this it looks like just ".attr('data-id')" returns a string where as ".data('id')" returns the int...
[15:43:55] <snkcld> http://i.imgur.com/nC5FUdn.png
[15:52:08] <grafi> snkcld in any case .attr is not meant to be used to retrieve stuff from the data attributes ;)
[15:52:35] <snkcld> grafi, yea yea, i totally understand.
[15:52:58] <snkcld> im using handlebars to render templates though, and sticking information in the element's data dash attributes. so i kinda need to use .attr() unfortunately
[15:53:21] <grafi> how so?
[15:54:36] <snkcld> well im retrieving data from an api, then passing those objects into handlebars to render a template. the template contains data-artist-id for example, so that when they click on an artist button, i have the id which was set via handlebars
[15:55:11] <grafi> and you cant do that with .data()?
[15:56:53] <snkcld> well, i guess i can, but i would rather be consistent and stick with either using .attr, or .data, and not really intermix the two if im going one way
[15:57:18] <snkcld> because if i update a data- attribute, .data doesnt catch if its done via .attr(), no?
[15:57:55] <shoky> snkcld: attribute values are always strings. if you use .attr, you can use parseInt to parse the string into an int
[15:58:06] <snkcld> shoky, yea thats what im doing atm
[15:58:25] <shoky> cool
[15:59:32] <snkcld> yea im just going to go ahead and switch over to using .data(), so i dont have to have parseInts all over the place
[16:00:39] <shoky> cool as well
[16:01:25] <snkcld> its just that, it seems weird, because when i update a value via $("#element").data("blah", 1010), the data-blah attribute's value on the element in the source does not seem to be update
[16:01:26] <snkcld> d
[16:01:33] <shoky> right
[16:01:36] <shoky> .data() doesn't write to attributes
[16:01:43] <shoky> but, you don't need to write to the attributes
[16:02:10] <shoky> that's slower anyways. just use .data() and you'll be able to read back whatever you wrote
[16:02:17] <snkcld> shoky, yea, i guess if i am consistent with using .data(), then it should be cool
[16:02:21] <shoky> yop
[16:13:31] <rmah> when I ask for a color using $("#foo").css("color") it comes back in the form rgb(1, 2, 3)
[16:13:44] <rmah> is there a way to force it to come back as #010203 ?
[16:16:34] <shoky> rmah: there's nothing built-in for that, no
[16:16:44] <rmah> god dammit.  ok thanks.
[16:16:54] <shoky> easy to do with a little code snippet
[16:17:10] <jphase> regex ftw
[16:17:16] <shoky> prolly jquery color plugin also deals with that
[16:25:23] <Manusoftar> i'm trying to make a confirm method using jquery ui dialog
[16:26:00] <Manusoftar> the thing is i can't find the way to return the clicked button through the function that loads the dialog in the first moment
[17:01:49] <grafi> jphase regex? oô
[17:04:05] <jphase> hehe, yeah for converting rgb to hex0r
[17:04:24] <jphase> well, for formatting the string that is
[17:09:35] <grafi> i thought you were proposing to convert 255 to FF with a regex :p
[17:10:27] <jphase> oh hell to the no
[17:10:56] <sacho> maybe not 255 but certainly a power of two base
[17:11:20] <dopie> is there a way to refactor this code?
[17:11:21] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/tcloninger/e5qaD/
[17:15:23] <sacho> why do you think it needs to be refactored
[17:15:34] <dopie> I think its a bit overkill no?
[17:17:55] <duch_kazatel> so you're checking if something is visible and, if so, fade it in?
[17:18:29] <grafi> might be a problem that the calculating even if the element is already visible, for bigger stuff
[17:18:30] <bobbobbins> anyone use jplayer? I'm trying to change the start time of an audio file, but i don't see how
[17:18:43] <grafi> *doesnt stop
[17:18:47] <grafi> somewhere in there :P
[17:19:08] <duch_kazatel> you can check the window once and then check the element when the user is done scrolling.
[17:19:09] <duch_kazatel> depending.
[17:30:36] <dopie> anyone use CKEditor here?
[17:32:05] <grafi> nope
[17:32:45] <duch_kazatel> welp/.
[17:44:36] <cam> How does this happen? $('#d1').offset({top:490, left:200}) => Object {top: 493.3333435058594, left: 720.295166015625}
[17:48:36] <unnu> hey guys, whats the best way to pipe a message id in a mail page with jquery?
[17:48:51] <unnu> lemme fiddle the code
[17:53:44] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/N2Ggn/6/
[17:56:27] <sunbeam> $(".row:not('.class')")
[17:56:36] <sunbeam> What's wrong with this selector?
[17:56:40] <unnu> i wanna do something along the lines of $('div.message a').on('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $.get(this.href, {username:'user', messageid:'    ID of the Anchor   '}); });
[17:57:38] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam $(".row:not(.class)")
[17:58:01] <unnu> $('.row').not('.class') would work too i think
[17:58:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> ^agreed
[17:59:02] <unnu> but duch_kazatel's looks prettier
[17:59:03] <unnu> :P
[17:59:11] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:59:14] <duch_kazatel> agreed ;)
[17:59:15] <Armistice> Oooo I want to see something pretty!
[17:59:28] <duch_kazatel> jquery selectors are like my crack.
[17:59:42] <unnu> http://i.qkme.me/3q2lpc.jpg
[17:59:50] <duch_kazatel> lol
[17:59:55] <unnu> there is something pretty
[18:00:10] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: that doesnt work
[18:00:21] <unnu> sunbeam, you gotta fiddle?
[18:00:26] <Armistice> That annoys me so much. You can get this cute little LED and it'll appear like it will never blow... then suddenly, poof!
[18:00:27] <sunbeam> unnu: i need (".row:not(.class) .another-class)
[18:00:33] <sunbeam> does that change anything?
[18:01:12] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam you need all .another-class inside of all .row that doesn't have .class?
[18:01:25] <Armistice> Anyway, my issue. I don't have anything to show for it per se but lets say I have an element and I want to search through all of it's content, and then if there are children elements, search through them. Basically I want to find a string, and replace it with some html. What would be the best way to go about this?
[18:01:53] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: right
[18:02:07] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam yeah toss up a fiddle.
[18:02:08] <unnu> $('.row.another-class').not('.class')
[18:02:24] <duch_kazatel> $(".row:not(.class) .another-class") should work.
[18:02:34] <unnu> ^^^^ yeah that too
[18:02:36] <sunbeam> .row .anonther-class
[18:02:41] <unnu> i can't make pretty selectors
[18:02:43] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: it doesnt :(
[18:02:50] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam did you copy mine and try it?
[18:02:54] <unnu> for serious, jsfiddle
[18:02:58] <duch_kazatel> because the one you pasted was invalid.
[18:03:03] <grafi> $('.another-class.row:not(.class)')

[18:41:57] <unnu> hey bruh, jquery .each()
[18:42:46] <unnu> im trying to post the id of each anchor that has a checkbox before it that is checked
[18:43:21] <unnu> wanna fid?
[18:43:31] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/N2Ggn/6/
[18:43:33] <jphase> k
[18:44:04] <unnu> when i hit delete i wanna post those id's of those anchors and append to the post action:'delete'
[18:46:55] <unnu> does that make any sense jphase?
[18:47:00] <jphase> yeah, sec
[18:47:05] <unnu> kay
[18:48:02] <jphase> well this is going to toggle them all
[18:48:21] <jphase> do you want it to work like a normal select all? where turns all that aren't checked on and then visa versa when unchecked?
[18:51:05] <unnu> i like the check that is there
[18:51:16] <unnu> i need the delete buttons to work it nowz
[18:51:37] <jphase> sec
[18:54:10] <unnu> sorry jphase
[18:54:18] <unnu> im still kinda new with the jquery
[18:54:27] <unnu> and all of its OP oop
[18:54:42] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/N2Ggn/9/
[18:54:45] <jphase> well that's one way
[18:54:56] <jphase> I think you can use the checked boolean to shorten that if else though
[18:55:29] <jphase> yeah like this:   http://jsfiddle.net/N2Ggn/10/
[18:57:23] <unnu> nice
[18:57:37] <jphase> also, you can pass $ inside your function wrapper instead of var $ = jQuery - http://jsfiddle.net/N2Ggn/13/
[18:57:48] <jphase> brb, dinner
[18:57:53] <unnu> aight
[18:59:27] <raj> anyone around??
[19:02:04] <JimmyXander> Hello
[19:10:19] <JimmyXander> How do I make it so that when an object is clicked something happens, but children inside that object are ignored? Here is my example. http://jsfiddle.net/rH9UB/7/
[19:10:40] <JimmyXander> press the escape key to start
[19:10:55] <JimmyXander> it brings up the modal
[19:12:01] <jphase> JimmyXander: event.stopPropagation();  -  http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/rH9UB/8/
[19:13:06] <jphase> return false;  is also acceptable as well but will also stop any events that are bound to that click
[19:14:26] <JimmyXander> thanks that worked perfectly
[19:15:01] <jphase> np
[19:16:51] <unnu> RAWR
[19:18:21] <unnu> jphase, i feel like a newb
[19:18:26] <Armistice> http://jsfiddle.net/fEg5g/4/ I'm having problems with this very simple emojify script. Basically for some reason, selected_emojis is an array containing an array containing an array. When it should only be an array with two elements, in an array. I'm not sure why it's doing that. None the less, my other issue is that when it grabs the regex, it's not matching anything?
[19:19:06] <jphase> unnu: all good, I'm a noob in plenty of languages, even node which is js lol
[19:19:17] <unnu> lol, i can php for days
[19:19:21] <unnu> this jquery is kicking my ass
[19:19:31] <unnu> also, api.jquery.com is giving me a 502
[19:19:40] <Armistice> Same.
[19:20:02] <unnu> whew, its not just me . . . . damn, its not just me . . . .
[19:20:08] <jphase> yeah it's down
[19:20:33] <zakj> http://devdocs.io/ has a searchable cached copy of the jquery docs
[19:20:55] <raj> hola tw2113
[19:21:27] <jphase> Armistice: hmm, you have a double return there, line 50 as well as 63. Is that intentional?
[19:21:34] <unnu> alright jphase . . . i think i got this . . . . $('div.message checkbox:ischecked').parent().id   ????
[19:21:43] <unnu> how wrong is that XD
[19:21:51] <raj> are you black?
[19:21:56] <fairuz1> Hi guys. I have an ajax call that didn't get called on some machines (on Chrome). When I add the disable-web-security argument to Chrome, the ajax call works. My question is why it happens only on some machines?
[19:22:22] <tw2113> grafi, http://www.last.fm/user/tw2113
[19:22:42] <jphase> unnu: :ischecked isn't a selector, you could use :checked though if you want it in your selector
[19:22:51] <jphase> unnu: otherwise .is(':checked') will return boolean
[19:23:03] <unnu> i just want the id of the parent anchor element
[19:23:12] * unnu facepalms
[19:23:15] <Armistice> jphase: yes. Basically the first return on line 50 is the one that returns the element after the .each has done it's process on the data. As the .each takes a function parameter, that function...not sure if it needs a return to be honest. I'm a bit clueless :P
[19:24:05] <grafi> some very distinguished taste you have there tw2113 ;)
[19:25:51] <cam> so jquery.com is down
[19:25:58] <cam> what's up with that...
[19:25:59] <Armistice> The first return isn't even needed but it does allow method chaining so it's probably a good thing to keep it there jphase but yeah. I'm basically trying to "convert" a javascript plugin to a jquery plugin. Mostly because to enable this plugin to work on tag names, class names, and ids, and everything else.. it's just easier to use jquery. ;p
[19:26:36] <jphase> yeah, I just do my wrappers a bit different is all, I see now
[19:28:08] <zakj> Armistice: it sounds like you want selected_emojis.extend(...) in all the places you're currently using selected_emojis.push, though I may be misunderstanding you
[19:28:44] <Armistice> zakj I always forget about using .extend :P
[19:29:02] <zakj> Armistice: you'll also need to change the condition in your for loop to check selected_emojis.length, rather than just selected_emojis
[19:29:28] <zakj> Armistice: deeply-nested data structures are always confusing ;)
[19:29:29] <Armistice> whoops zakj lemme make those changes, for a feeling the latter is the one causin the main problem :P
[19:29:47] <dogonthehorizon> Hi, is there a problem with the jquery website? I seem to be hitting a 502 error for jquery.com and api.jquery.com, jquerymobile.com and blog.jquery.com seem to be okay.
[19:32:01] <Armistice> zakj can I do selected_emojis.extend(), I mean... selected_emojis isn't a jquery object?
[19:32:28] <jphase> Armistice: .extend will extend any object yeah
[19:32:45] <jphase> oh hai zakj :D
[19:32:53] <zakj> ah, but good point, Array.extend() may not be cross-browser
[19:32:59] <zakj> hiya jphase! :)
[19:33:19] <Armistice> zakj: it is not, well at least it doesn't appear to work on the latest version of chrome :P
[19:33:44] <Armistice> no big deal though.
[19:34:24] <gnarf> dogonthehorizon: looking into it
[19:34:43] <zakj> Armistice: sorry about that! my python-brain is leaking :(
[19:34:49] <dogonthehorizon> gnarf: thanks!
[19:36:29] <ns5> There is a div in the page, $("#feed-type-name"), I changed its text by $("#feed-type-name").text('mytext"), but the text doesn't change in the browser, and $("#feed-type-name").text('mytext').show() also doesn't work.  Any idea?
[19:37:00] <zakj> Armistice: for what it's worth: Array.prototype.push.apply(selected_emojis, ...)  (if my guess was right and you were shooting for a flatter list)
[19:37:36] <Armistice> zakj: haha it's alright. http://jsfiddle.net/fEg5g/6/ So it kind of works... but it's very selfish. It's stealing part of the :office: even though options.places_enable is set to false! The greedy bugger!
[19:38:16] <zakj> Armistice: ":o" is getting converted to your scream emoji, looks like
[19:38:30] <Armistice> zakj: that it is. :P
[19:39:13] <zakj> adding places to selected_emojis before you add emoticons ought to work around that
[19:39:53] <zakj> or you could add a word boundary (\b) to your scream regex
[19:41:35] <Armistice> zakj: ah yes, that is what occurs in the standalone js version. I think just changing the order around would be better than increasing the length of the regex (only emoticons though by the looks of it)
[19:42:58] <Armistice> Oh, that didn't make much of a difference actually. it would still be greedy if the others are false as it's searching through the whole thing.
[19:43:34] <dogonthehorizon> I must be going now, but I know gnarf is looking into site availability for jquery.com and api.jquery.com. Take care everyone!
[19:43:56] <Armistice> zakj: how would the boundary work? [/\b:-*o\b/gi, 'emojify scream'] breaks :o all together
[19:44:49] <cballenar> Hey all!
[19:45:49] <zakj> Armistice: I would just use the one at the end, /:-*o\b/
[19:47:04] <zakj> though I'm curious now why that matches (for me, anyway), but the boundary at the beginning doesn't...
[19:48:26] <Armistice> ooho zakj so does mean any a-z0-9 character would count as the same word and thus it won't match the regex? I'm not sure but my guess would be the \r\n (new line) would be playing with the :o itself, so it would assume it's n:o and thus not match.
[19:50:17] <cballenar> What would be the best way to select an element right after creating it dynamically i.e. via .add(). I am able to create it but I don't know how to select it immediately after. It'd be cool if I could just chain it right after the .add (I intend to have multiple elements of the same kind being created the same way, with same class name) Any suggestions? I thought about maybe adding ID's but I'm not sure how to increase the count
[19:52:42] <ns5> How to add a div horizontally to the right of the current div?
[19:56:46] <zakj> Armistice: some testing makes me think it's something to do with the colon ('foo'.match(/\bfoo/) matches; ':foo'.match(\b:foo) does not), but I give up :P
[19:59:21] <Armistice> zakj: hmm oh well, it works either way. Need to make some tweaking. Right now it'll select the html of an element and perform the operation which is a no-no. So need to do some hierarchical work. :P
[20:00:37] <jphase> Armistice: oh, well to do that you need to actually create a new RegExp object I believe
[20:01:11] <jphase> I'm doing this with my node project right now
[20:02:15] <Armistice> jphase: I shouldn't have to. Just detect if there are children and keep going until there are no children and then replace with .text or something. Although I was thinking about ... <div class="parent"><div class="child">:D</div>:(</div>, that might fail... not too sure.
[20:02:16] <jphase> http://paste.ofcode.org/HKEWzRjmCFSC8Yj9vvEGYa   like line 24+
[20:02:35] <jphase> oh okay, thought you'd have to make a regex object based on string
[20:03:08] <jphase> nvm then
[20:05:23] <Armistice> damn that looks hot jphase :P I've done a bit of node myself but only really with io.sockets more than anything. Which is a bummer as there is no API documentation. The tutorials of socket.io are of basic apps and if you want to do something top-notch then you're kind of on your own.
[20:06:33] <unnu> stupid question
[20:06:37] <jphase> yeah, it's a pretty close-knit community, if you get the nerds in #node.js to talk to you that often works as your best documentation heh
[20:06:45] <jphase> unnu: no such thing :P
[20:06:46] <unnu> when using $.post() should i do it to this.href
[20:07:00] <jphase> you can, yes
[20:07:04] <unnu> kay
[20:07:24] <unnu> im getting a weird error when i do it to http://www.example.com/page.php
[20:07:45] <unnu> Origin http://example.com is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin.
[20:08:01] <jphase> unnu: yeah, to do it CORS (cross domain) then you need to set a setting on the server
[20:08:55] <unnu> okay
[20:08:58] <jphase> unnu: in .htaccess (or in apache confs) you can set:    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"   on the remote domain to change that
[20:09:00] <unnu> how do i change it to the page
[20:09:10] <unnu> its on the same server
[20:09:18] <unnu> also i wanna eleminate the chance of XXS
[20:09:30] <jphase> oh, '/page.php' should work if example.com is your domain
[20:09:36] <unnu> OH
[20:09:36] <unnu> okay
[20:12:54] <jphase> unnu: I typically just grab the action from the closest form tag and then set action="<?php echo $_SERVER['PHP_SELF']; ?>" but there's plenty of ways to do it
[20:13:58] <unnu> aight
[20:14:02] <unnu> next question
[20:14:18] <unnu> if i wanna post to an element thats not in the dom yet
[20:14:22] <unnu> erhh
[20:14:23] <unnu> rather
[20:14:30] <unnu> post when a button is clicked
[20:14:35] <unnu> but the button is not in the dom yet
[20:14:42] <unnu> how can i do that?
[20:14:44] <jphase> unnu: bind the click event to the button as you create it
[20:14:58] <unnu> so i need to make it a function?
[20:15:32] <jphase> $('<button>').click(function() { // do stuff ajaxy }).appendTo($('body'));    or something similar
[20:15:48] <unnu> thats what i have
[20:15:49] <unnu> hrmm
[20:15:57] <unnu> except i have .on('click'
[20:16:01] <jphase> that's fine
[20:16:09] <jphase> .click is an alias for .on('click'
[20:16:30] <unnu> .appendTo?
[20:16:38] <unnu> im using function(result)
[20:16:56] <unnu> and $('#div').html(result)
[20:17:05] <jphase> that's just one of the many.... you can do like $('body').append( // your created element ); as well
[20:17:11] <unnu> okay
[20:17:15] <unnu> then why isn't it working
[20:17:16] <unnu> GAH
[20:17:22] <unnu> i hate learning new languanges
[20:17:27] <unnu> you know, until i learn them
[20:17:28] <unnu> lol
[20:17:36] <jphase> unnu: is result just an html string then?
[20:17:39] <unnu> yeah
[20:17:44] <tw2113> i've always taken js as being one of those that you pull your hair out over until it clicks
[20:17:45] <jphase> unnu: oh, you'll need to parse it first then
[20:17:51] <unnu> how so?
[20:18:33] <jphase> unnu: something like... var myStuff = $.parseHTML(result);    and then you can do like....   myStuff.find('button').click(function(){});
[20:18:49] <unnu> O.o
[20:19:07] <jphase> then you can append the entire myStuff object (not with .html but with .append, .appendTo, .insertAfter, .insertBefore, etc.)
[20:19:16] <unnu> okay
[20:19:16] <unnu> im
[20:19:18] <unnu> uhmm
[20:19:34] <unnu> is parseHTML() a jquery function?
[20:19:39] <jphase> yeah
[20:19:41] <unnu> OKAY
[20:19:45] <unnu> makes more sense
[20:19:47] <jphase> it takes an HTML string and parses into a jQuery DOM object
[20:19:50] <unnu> OH
[20:19:51] <unnu> okay
[20:19:53] <jphase> then, .find works etc.
[20:19:56] <unnu> :D
[20:20:00] <unnu> your the best jphase
[20:20:06] <Armistice> jphase: I think I did something wrong: http://jsfiddle.net/fEg5g/10/ LOL I'm pretty sure I'm on the right track...
[20:20:10] * unnu hugs jphase
[20:20:16] <jphase> :D
[20:20:50] <jphase> oooo recursion!
[20:22:05] <Armistice> o
[20:22:13] <Armistice> element.html(hierarchicalReplace($(this), regex, replaceWith)); ... I think that should be $(this).html(...)
[20:22:15] <Armistice> as it's a child
[20:22:35] <Armistice> http://jsfiddle.net/fEg5g/11/ BOOOOM
[20:22:52] <jphase> nice!
[20:26:06] <Armistice> Of course the dilemma I mentioned earlier if there was a child element alongside just regular content, would still stand but I'm not sure how I'd do that at all. .text() would get the text, sure... however replacing that text in it's relevant elements could be a problem. Plus, I need to check for the class .no-emojify and if that's present, then it would ignore it. Not hard to implement that in my method though. I'm not too worrie
[20:27:12] <ns5> how to add css style "overflow:hidden" to a div's parent?
[20:27:38] <Armistice> $("div").parent().css("overflow", "hidden");
[20:28:10] <jphase> Armistice: your .replace should do that, you just need to change your regex flags
[20:28:45] <jphase> /regexstring/gim
[20:30:55] <ns5> Armistice: Thanks, the css style is added
[20:33:57] <jaypitidi> would it be better to structure a calendar with an unordered list or with a table
[20:35:16] <jphase> jaypitidi: more of a question for the folks in #css but table would be "easier" to keep the columns all the same width, but you can also use css to display divs and whatever element as a table cell as well
[20:35:33] <jphase> depends on how backwards compatible with moldy versions of IE you want to be really
[20:36:23] <jaypitidi> I'm really not going to support anything less than ie8 and js is a must
[20:36:40] <Armistice> Actually that code didn't work as I expected it to. It didn't iterate through children nodes. I mean, it did ... but it would skip all that and do the bit at the end of the function anyway. However, the no-emojify does indeed work... nothing else does though. http://jsfiddle.net/fEg5g/12/
[20:40:14] <Armistice> Bummer. It's treating <br /> as elements, thus the emotes next to it become ignored.
[20:44:37] <zakj> Armistice: just a quick skim of your much-updated code, but I don't think you want that "return" on line 45
[20:45:32] <Armistice> Yeah I don't zakj I needed an else though for that if statement. My current problem is the lack of options. http://jsfiddle.net/fEg5g/13/ places_enabled is set to true however it's not extending the array.
[20:49:50] <Armistice> Ok so the options are working, it's detecting true but the array must be overwritten.
[20:51:14] <zakj> Armistice: $.extend only works on objects, I think. try http://jsfiddle.net/5kj3m/
[20:52:14] <Armistice> zakj: the emoticons are not working on that. :) should be converted but isn't.
[20:52:38] <Armistice> and only one place? office is a place too but it's only converting school.
[20:53:10] <zakj> weird... selected_emojis has all the appropriate bits in it
[20:54:27] <Armistice> zakj: yeah it's probably my crazy way of converting things.. it's all messed up :( but yet I don't see where I've gone wrong
[20:55:13] <jphase> hmm, what are we doing now? sorry, so many updates I'm lost
[20:55:15] <jphase> extending issues?
[20:56:29] <Armistice> zakj apparently fixed that, it's just not converting :), and :office: but only :school:, see zakj's fiddle
[20:57:14] * zakj reads back to try to understand why this hierarchichalReplace is doing what it is...
[20:57:47] <jphase> so what's the purpose exactly, are you trying to globally replace or only within a certain scope?
[20:57:54] <jphase> oh nvm
[20:58:21] <zakj> Armistice: http://jsfiddle.net/5kj3m/1/, but I removed the per-child recursion, since element.html() includes all of its children's html
[20:58:47] <zakj> ahhh, nevermind, I see now
[20:58:57] <zakj> you need to avoid nested .no-emojify elements
[20:59:26] <Armistice> https://github.com/hassankhan/emojify.js/blob/master/emojify.js this is basically the standalone javascript plugin, and I'm just trying to do a jquery version.
[20:59:42] <Armistice> Seein as that version does not have support for tag names, classess and other crazy things that jquery allows with ease :P
[20:59:54] <Armistice> I don't understand it enough though.
[21:01:20] <Armistice> The reason why I don't want to include html but only it's text, is because of http://jsfiddle.net/5kj3m/2/ ... having something inside an attribute will just allow it to be replaced which wouldn't be the idea.
[21:02:06] <zakj> Armistice: how about something like jQuery.fn.emojify = function () { this.forEach(function (el) { window.emojify(el); }) };  ? :P
[21:03:01] <zakj> (i.e., just wrap the existing function)
[21:03:03] <Armistice> zakj well I'd say that's a lazy method hahaha but ... +1 ;)
[21:03:27] <zakj> three great virtues of a programmer: http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?LazinessImpatienceHubris
[21:04:32] <jphase> awe look how adorable google is today ;]
[21:05:16] <zakj> oops, I landed in the water :/
[21:05:26] <jphase> heh
[21:06:06] <tw2113> a weird mix of mario and abraham lincoln
[21:06:41] <jphase> hmm, I just realized I must've gone an entire work day without googling... go me!
[21:07:03] <tw2113> i do that regularly, i search with DuckDuckGo :P
[21:07:11] <jphase> duckduckgo?
[21:07:16] <tw2113> yup
[21:07:21] <jphase> hmm, neat
[21:07:28] <tw2113> https://duckduckgo.com/
[21:07:31] <zakj> I could have sworn there was a different (non-interactive) doodle up earlier
[21:08:27] <jphase> sshhhh, my self-esteem is on the line!
[21:09:30] <Armistice> zakj your laziness broke it! However I think this worked: $.fn.emojify = function () { $(this).each(function(el) { window.emojify.run(el); }) };
[21:10:11] <zakj> Armistice: haha sorry, I wrote that directly into my IRC client, untested
[21:10:43] <zakj> ... ever the optimist, me
[21:11:12] <Armistice> zakj: in fact it didn't work.Not one little bit. I mean, it did the conversion process but it kind of ignored the element passed to .run, but instead kind of performed the operation on "body" (the default) which is not what I wanted. poop.
[21:11:58] <zakj> ewww. there goes my optimism for the night, then
[21:12:42] <Armistice> well okay 'div' is the default. and pretty much everything is a div so yeah I assumed 'body' heh
[21:13:54] <Armistice> wait actually I'm majorly unsure. the tag_type used is what the output is meant to be.
[21:16:32] <Armistice> el is apparently undefined.
[21:21:32] <zakj> Armistice: ugh, this is why I should never paste anything untested, and yet here I go again: jQuery.fn.emojify = function () { this.each(function (i, el) { window.emojify.run(el); }) };   (in this case the only untested bit is the emojify.run)
[21:23:21] <Armistice> there we go zakj :P that worked. I tried window.emojify.run(el[0]); in the previous, but it didn't quite work either but yea... that worked :P
[21:23:23] <Armistice> thanks :P
[21:23:46] <zakj> np, sorry for all the back and forth!
[21:24:58] <Armistice> hahaha. I would still prefer the entire plugin jquery, but this will probably do for now.
[21:25:39] <zakj> yeah, rewriting the whole thing would be a fun exercise
[21:27:36] <Armistice> I could probably manage with half jquery in the plugin but to be honest, if I'm going to use a lib I may aswell use it in it's full entirety not just for bits and pieces but that's just me... but hey, thank anyway. Now I can sleep at last!
[21:43:05] <d3m0n> Hey guys, I am looking to create a parallax effect the works smoothly with mousewheel scroll and was suggested on here to go with jquery animations, I found a site that does this quite well and trying to pick apart the code to create my own. Heres the jQuery I found to be doing the magic: http://pastebin.com/vjKeHrc0 and heres the site: http://www.milwaukeepolicenews.com/
[21:43:31] <d3m0n> From what I gather, they first set a calcuation function for the amount of scolled and set speed individually.
[21:43:44] <d3m0n> Then bind it to the scroll function and do the math
[21:43:56] <dopie> hey all
[21:43:58] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/e5qaD/1212/
[21:44:28] <dopie> how do i make it where the first fade ins that are appearing already are shown
[21:44:36] <d3m0n> The calcuations are a bit odd for me, my thinking is all you would need is scrollTop - currentscroll then fire off the animation when it gets to that point
[21:44:48] <dopie> basically i want to do it if the fade in block
[21:44:56] <dopie> the first 2
[21:45:05] <dopie> are already visible without scrolling
[21:45:10] <dopie> then it shows it
[21:56:15] <d3m0n> Or can anyone suggest a tutorial I can read from to accomplish this same effect?
[21:59:34] <zakj> dopie: try http://jsfiddle.net/e5qaD/1215/
[22:01:02] <dopie> zackj
[22:01:05] <dopie> gangster
[22:02:31] <dopie> zakj,
[22:02:34] <dopie> works like a charm
[22:02:37] <dopie> thank you so much!
[22:02:41] <zakj> woohoo!
[22:04:05] <dopie> zakj, part 1.2 how would i add h1, h2 all into that
[22:06:08] <dopie> just add a , :)
[22:06:16] <dopie> zakj,  man much cleaner code
[22:06:18] <dopie> rofl
[22:06:34] <zakj> I just named your anonymous function ;)
[22:06:47] <dopie> :)
[22:08:23] <Suresh> hi...i have a column with wrapped text one below the other
[22:08:58] <Guest79147> how do i append a button next to the first row of the column text
[22:09:47] <Guest79147> $(this).children().first().next()
[22:09:57] <Guest79147> i tried this piece of code
[22:10:28] <dsfa> Will my form control values be submitted by this code? http://bpaste.net/show/E5mJAIw9sipea1VdoCco/ So that I can use a request.getParameter() on java server
[22:13:13] <jphase> Guest59756: don't know what you mean by column text
[22:13:40] <jphase> dsfa: CommonReceiptPDF doesn't look like a valid URL to me
[22:14:46] <dsfa> jphase: its a web-app local resource
[22:15:09] <jphase> dsfa: also, if you're using jQuery, no need to use old school javascript up there. document.getElementById("src").value can just be $('#src').val($(document).html())  perhaps
[22:15:26] <jphase> oh, but you use that below, hmm
[22:16:05] <jphase> dsfa: and you may need to pass some data with data:  ?
[22:16:23] <dopie> zakj, just like to say YOU ROCK MAN....
[22:16:26] <dopie> wow
[22:16:31] <dopie> the client is going to lose his shit
[22:16:38] <dsfa> jphase: data s what I want
[22:21:12] <jphase> dsfa: I'm a bit confused what you're trying to do here, your ajax post won't send any data unless you pass data: there. I don't see ay markup so I can't really help you for sure, but you might start with data: $('form#myForm').serialize(),
[22:21:23] <zakj> dopie: haha, first time I won't even take my usual cut :P
[22:22:08] <dsfa> jphase: that was what I was meaning.. data or serialize is required it seems.. thanks for the help
[22:22:40] <jphase> np
[22:23:28] <jphase> dsfa: I don't think it's technically not required to send data, but your server-side script must be coded to not care about data though
[22:23:36] <jphase> whoa, grammar fail
[22:23:40] <jphase> -not
[22:25:42] <dopie> zakj,  dont mind paying ya
[22:25:46] <dopie> whats your paypal
[22:26:21] <zakj> dopie: that's very generous! but there's no need, just answer a question for someone else someday :)
[22:26:48] <dopie> :) i will someday but my jquery skills are worse than everyone's in here
[22:26:49] <dopie> :P
[22:27:14] <zakj> everybody starts somewhere!
[22:27:45] <Red_Onyx> definitely
[22:28:01] <Red_Onyx> when I first saw jQuery, my first impression was, "What is this? What does it do?"
[22:29:25] <dopie> Red_Onyx,  im on that phase
[22:29:33] <dopie> im learning ruby and RoR
[22:29:34] <dopie> first
[22:29:35] <dopie> :)
[22:32:25] <meowsus> Hey. I'm curious how to retrieve an image from the server and set it as a background image on an element after it has been *fully* loaded. Here's what I've tried so far, which works, but there's a slight delay and you can see the jitter. I guess something asynchronous? http://pastie.org/pastes/8420447/text?key=3xyhc8pwr7ihgo7aj5gtow
[22:35:35] <jphase> meowsus: try removing your element after you set the bg
[22:37:20] <StevenD> What is GPU License ?
[22:37:59] <Red_Onyx> I am earning Java. There's no Ruby on Rails, or Joomla, or Wordpress, in Java, as far as I know
[22:38:23] <dopie> Red_Onyx, correct
[22:38:27] <meowsus> jphase: duh, that seemed to have totally worked.
[22:38:32] <dopie> Red_Onyx, i hate joomla and wordpress
[22:38:33] <dopie> :)
[22:38:44] <Red_Onyx> I love Joomla. Don't care for Wordpress
[22:38:53] <jphase> I am visa versa :\
[22:39:28] <meowsus> Red_Onyx: Here's an annoying video on the matter http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/the-curious-coders-java-web-frameworks-comparison-spring-mvc-grails-vaadin-gwt-wicket-play-struts-and-jsf/
[22:40:37] <jphase> I'm starting to like node quite a bit though, a bit of a fancy tickler :D
[22:59:26] <jphase> bah, I don't know which direction to go with my project now :[
[23:13:52] <bigbugjava> hi, in HTML5 there is some important validation on forms, now if  I set another button to trigger the events, it dones't go trough that validation, how can I make it run the validation on inputs fields, even if I'm not "submiting" the form, from submit button
[23:14:00] <Red_Onyx> meow, I had no idea tere were java web frameworks
[23:14:03] <Red_Onyx> reading right now
[23:21:16] <Cork> bigbugjava: you should always trigger a form submition through the submit of the form (and then preventDefault if you don't want it)
[23:21:32] <Cork> bigbugjava: though that said, you can run .checkValidity()
[23:21:35] <jphase> bigbugjava: hmm, like you want to programmatically call HTML5's validation without submitting the form you mean?
[23:21:45] <jphase> oh sorry, was scrolled up when I wrote that
[23:30:57] <Red_Onyx> http://vschart.com/compare/spring-framework/vs/joomla
[23:34:34] <bigbugjava2> Cork Preventdefalut doesn't work that good in that case, becasue a button with ajax sending the data, works better for me in that case
[23:35:06] <bigbugjava2> wierd line I wrote.. was messing with a few things, lol
[23:35:53] <Cork> bigbugjava2: you should be able to run the ajax from the submit event just fine; and it would make your form not break too
[23:36:07] <Cork> (as click on a button won't work for all user cases)
[23:36:22] <bigbugjava2> Cork why shouldn't it work?
[23:36:43] <bigbugjava2> broswer verstion?
[23:36:59] <Cork> bigbugjava2: accesibility
[23:37:09] <Cork> not all users can see, so they don't click
[23:37:23] <Cork> but they do submit
[23:37:25] <bigbugjava2> I see
[23:37:38] <Cork> also ex. enter on the form doesn't trigger click
[23:37:54] <Cork> there is a lot of cases you break if you use click on a button instead of submit on the form
[23:38:56] <bigbugjava> giving ya jsfiddle, if ya can guide me to the current way of preventing
[23:39:57] <jphase> return false oughta do it unless you're needing bubbling
[23:40:25] <Cork> you shouldn't use return false
[23:40:37] <Cork> as that stops the event loop, and causes other event handlers to break
[23:41:45] <bigbugjava> something is crapping up there, try to catch ya later
[23:41:48] <bigbugjava> thanks for help!
[23:43:18] <siovene> Hi. I'm dynamically changing the "src" attribute of an image. Is it possible to somehow get an event after the new image has finished loading in the browser?
[23:43:31] <Cork> yes
[23:43:39] <Cork> bind a load event listener on the img
[23:43:59] <Cork> but do it BEFORE you change the src
[23:44:52] <siovene> Cork, thank you, I'll try.
[23:56:13] <siovene> Cork, thanks, it worked.
