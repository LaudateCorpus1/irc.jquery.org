[00:49:53] <timkofu> hi guys
[00:52:03] <timkofu> this code http://dpaste.org/8drBP/ pops a null
[00:52:09] <timkofu> im i using it wrong?
[00:52:35] <timkofu> accessing /thesenodes/nodes.json gives plenty of json
[00:52:42] <timkofu> help?
[00:58:27] <timkofu> anyone?
[01:00:23] <Danny_B|backup> hi, how can i change the wrapping element? say $('#foo span') -> all spans will be turned to <strong>
[01:06:50] <Hereisanotherlie> Danny_B|backup: http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[01:31:17] <gnarf> Danny_B|backup: whats the use case for that anyway?
[01:31:48] <gnarf> why not just add a class to them
[01:31:57] <Danny_B|backup> that was an example
[01:31:59] <gnarf> that gives them strong like appearance
[01:32:19] <Danny_B|backup> i actually need to change <span>s to <option>s
[01:32:38] <gnarf> so like, the <option> shouldn't exist outside of a select
[01:34:54] <gnarf> but you could var select = $("<select>"); $("#foo span").each(function() { var optionText = $(this).text(); $("<option>").text( optionText ).val( optionText ).appendTo( select ); });
[01:35:00] <gnarf> then append the select to something
[01:35:05] <gnarf> and remove your span
[01:35:06] <gnarf> s
[01:35:49] <gnarf> Danny_B|backup: So like - its generally a bad idea to try to generalize a problem because changing a <span> to a <strong> in not very similar to changing it into an <option>
[01:36:13] <gnarf> the former seems pointless, and the latter requires setting text and value of the option, and appending it to a select element
[01:40:32] <Danny_B|backup> that seems too complicated to me. i was hoping for sth like
[01:40:34] <Danny_B|backup> $select = $('<select/>');$('span.bar').appendTo($select).replaceWith('<option>'+$(this).text()+'</option>');$('.foo').append($select);
[01:41:23] <Danny_B|backup> however this doesn't put the inner text of span to option
[01:41:49] <gnarf> after the each you can add .remove() to get rid of the spans
[01:41:59] <gnarf> and then append the select you made
[01:42:37] <gnarf> so like mine actually does what you need it to ;) -- also if there are any <'s in the text of your span that html assembly will break because its not escaped
[01:43:51] <gnarf> It's better to set .text( text ) than do "<tag>"+text+"</tag>"
[01:44:43] <gnarf> also, you didn't set value either - which will break if you have a " in your span text if you try to use "<option value=\"" + text + "\">
[01:45:02] <gnarf> so - the each is probably the best way to handle it
[01:54:15] <timkofu> Hi
[01:54:20] <timkofu> http://dpaste.org/OOmNj/
[01:54:32] <timkofu> why is nodes not getting assigned the data?
[01:56:04] <BinaryKitten> timkofu it probably is
[01:56:17] <BinaryKitten> but the console.log fires before the $.getJSON completes
[01:56:39] <timkofu> BinaryKitten: oh ... how do I "wait" then?
[01:56:42] <BinaryKitten> since $.getJSON is a non-blocking operation, it returns control back
[01:56:48] <BinaryKitten> that's what line 3 is doing
[01:57:06] <BinaryKitten> the function you pass to it, it gets called when complete
[01:57:15] <BinaryKitten> so put the console.log in there
[01:59:03] <timkofu> BinaryKitten: that was It. You have also filled a rather gaping knowledge hole in my head on how ajax works. Thanks a terabyte
[02:00:16] <BinaryKitten> np
[02:00:57] <BinaryKitten> the basic idea is you wouldn't try to drink the cola you just this second sent your mate to get from the shop
[02:01:14] <BinaryKitten> instead you would think, "once my friend is back, i'll drink that cola"

[04:08:36] <alaing> hi
[04:08:49] <zoster> hi
[04:26:02] <FernandoBasso> I have a $.post that sends a signal to the php code. That signal triggers a function in that php code, and that function returns a value. How do I $('#show_value').html... that value from the php function?
[04:27:14] <FernandoBasso> If my function echoes the value, then $('#show_value').html() works. But my php function is not echoing anything; it's just returning the value.
[04:28:54] <SoulRaven> anyone use swap method to get the width of a display: none element?
[04:30:16] <alaing> arrr there seems to be a memory leak in jquery UI
[05:12:12] <zamba> hi there.. how are you guys handling ajax feedback? let's say you manipulate something in a database and you want to know if the queries were successful.. how do you guys return that back to the calling javascript?
[05:12:33] <shiftingcontrol> https://gist.github.com/2941165, I am working on  bootstrap-timepicker.js , program never enters line 120, when I press tab any idea /

[07:02:28] <zoster> evening here might!
[07:21:38] <AxonetBE> how can I convert 12345678 to 12,345,678 with jquery?
[07:23:54] <Destos> if you're asking that questions we've already lost
[07:25:47] <sunbeam> i defined 2 fonts with @font-face but for some reason the fonts dont work in IE8
[07:25:49] <sunbeam> Here is the CSS that I used, http://pastebin.com/TkDacFfG
[07:28:07] <zoster> sunbeam, try installing chrome-frame
[07:28:37] <zoster> http://randsco.com/index.php/2009/07/04/p680
[07:31:51] <species> well i can cross the efficiency bridge when I come to actually implement higher ROF weapons
[07:32:30] <species> ooh, 3 questions: is this where I ask my 3 questions? Who will answer them? Can I get more questions?
[07:33:09] <Ernston> u talking about a game?
[07:34:36] <species> yeah
[07:34:42] <species> erm
[07:34:52] <species> ok sorry, i asked in the wrong channel

[07:36:17] <hex`> How can I minify these 6 lines? http://pastie.org/4098094
[07:36:49] <zoster> hex`: with code or handy?
[07:37:07] <hex`> with code, this doesn't look correct (duplicated)
[07:37:08] <rethus> i use the dialog-function in jquery.
[07:37:16] <rethus> how can i lay one dialoge over another...
[07:37:19] <zoster> form.find("div.alert.alert-error").each(function(){$(this).remove();});form.find("div.alert.alert-success").each(function(){$(this).remove();});
[07:37:25] <rethus> means how can i choose, which one is above
[07:37:47] <hex`> zoster: sorry, I explained wrong... what I want is to reduce that code... it seems it can be simplified
[07:38:20] <hex`> the only thing changing between those two parts is -error and -success
[07:39:19] <zoster> well it's nice to me..
[07:39:27] <zoster> rename your variables
[07:39:30] <zoster> form => f
[07:40:14] <hex`> I thougth more about if there's a way to use regex in this, such as form.find("div.alert.alert-$")
[07:40:17] <hex`> something like that
[07:40:48] <tdskate> can i ask jshint questions here? (What is to be done about "implied global" warnings?)
[07:42:37] <zoster> you can just use $ instead of form.find
[07:42:53] <zoster> form is mapped to a $('form') I suppose
[07:44:59] <hex`> ok, thanks
[07:47:14] <sigurding> guys, if I am searching for some jquery devs from germany as freelancers. Where would you recommend me to look?
[08:12:59] <FernandoBasso> How do I get the return value of a php function in jQuery using $.post? https://gist.github.com/2941600
[08:13:30] <zoster> WHAT?
[08:13:38] <zoster> you just
[08:13:52] <zoster> output your php function's ret.val. into that script
[08:14:04] <zoster> you can check some post variables
[08:14:11] <zoster> are they set, validated, etc
[08:14:15] <zoster> and then with you
[08:14:17] <zoster> your*
[08:14:37] <zoster> $.post(URL, handlerFunc, dataType); catch it with this handlerFunc
[08:14:44] <zoster> function(data) { alert(data); }
[08:14:57] <zoster> note to set an adequate datatype: text, html, json, script, etc
[08:15:04] <zoster> so you can handle it easily
[08:15:29] <zamba> hi there.. how are you guys handling ajax feedback? let's say you manipulate something in a database and you want to know if the queries were successful.. how do you guys return that back to the calling javascript?
[08:16:06] <zoster> success: true, errors: ['error 1', 'error2', etc]
[08:16:22] <zoster> in server side I output it in json format
[08:16:30] <zoster> then catch it with a jquery ajax handler
[08:16:41] <zamba> can you provide an example?
[08:16:43] <zoster> output it to the user, reload the page, etc :)
[08:16:47] <zoster> you use php?
[08:16:50] <zamba> yup
[08:16:53] <zoster> wait
[08:17:22] <zamba> [waiting]
[08:18:36] <FernandoBasso> zoster: How do I 'catch it with the handler function'?
[08:18:55] <FernandoBasso> Oh, sorry.
[08:19:05] <zamba> :)
[08:19:24] <FernandoBasso> but isn't that what I'm doing in that code snippet?
[08:24:18] <FernandoBasso> zoster: "output your php function's ret.val. into that script"; I didn't understand that part?
[08:24:29] <FernandoBasso> s/?//
[08:29:04] <FernandoBasso> Because if I just use echo() instead of return in my php function, then it just works.
[08:55:37] <otherj> can anyone point me toward an example of jquery code for clicking on a button toggling show/hide on a div?
[08:55:56] <gnarf> replaceWith( elem ) === .before( elem ).remove()

[09:06:02] <logiclord> I was trying to use load when all the images are available in the browser but the issue is that it cease to fire for images that already live in the browser's cache any way out ?
[09:07:32] <rampr1> logiclord:  I've preloadCSSImages and it seems to fire when the image is present in cache too
[09:07:44] <rampr1> I've used*
[09:09:26] <logiclord> rampr1: I am populating images as data URI dynamically
[09:09:30] <rampr> logiclord:  oh wait, I've used pieces of code from https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded/blob/master/jquery.imagesloaded.js so that it loads from cache
[09:13:09] <Galactica> im so stupid or what
[09:13:13] <Galactica> http://pastie.org/private/2vq2zj9eirpsxwnd4ejfvq
[09:13:50] <Galactica> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/     first example no workable
[09:13:52] <zoster> what's the problem Galactica ?
[09:14:21] <zoster> you havent supplied your "response"
[09:14:27] <zoster> var in the anonymous function
[09:14:34] <zoster> function(response) {
[09:14:36] <zoster> try like that
[09:14:52] <zoster> for every of your function() { /* here's your FOR loop */ }
[09:15:20] <Galactica> ok another example
[09:15:21] <Galactica> http://pastie.org/private/ecnovr5athrhmvgsnjisw
[09:15:51] <logiclord>  rampr: actually I want to wait for all images to available (load or alreay loaded) and not just one after that I perform a common task on them
[09:16:05] <zoster> you do not get ajax response?
[09:17:41] <Galactica> if I use single argument for when, in callback I get a response from ajax.success. this is not true
[09:17:58] <rampr> logiclord:  how about window.load ?
[09:18:13] <rampr> logiclord:  or you want to only wait for images to load ?
[09:18:21] <zoster> try
[09:18:24] <zoster> async: false
[09:18:27] <zoster> then you can
[09:18:33] <zoster> .responseText, reseponseXML
[09:18:40] <zoster> of the original xhr object
[09:19:53] <logiclord> rampe : yes I can manage a wait .. but how do I wait ?
[09:20:05] <logiclord> rampr : yes I can manage a wait .. but how do I wait ?
[09:20:50] <rampr> logiclord:  if you just wait for window.load will it help ?
[09:20:50] <Galactica> but I'm using dynamic arguments for $.when, and I want to receive the original xhr-object each time
[09:21:50] <logiclord> rampr: no I am working on a in browser ebook reader so I will be loading images multiple times
[09:22:30] <Galactica> $.when( $.ajax("test.aspx") ).then(function(ajaxArgs){  alert(ajaxArgs[1]); }); // this example from official api - not correctly too
[09:22:33] <rampr> logiclord: okay. so this plugin https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded triggers a callback when images are loaded, does that help ?
[09:23:02] <yannickoo> Hey guys, can anybody help me to get the back here? http://jsfiddle.net/94EqS/1/
[09:23:27] <logiclord> rampr: I think It can.. let me try
[09:24:22] <rampr> logiclord: okay. they also say they take care of cached images, reading through the code it looks so
[09:24:39] <nFFF> logiclord, you can do $('img#hai').load(function(){
[09:24:50] <nFFF> but i havent read your problem so not sure if that helps :D
[09:26:19] <nFFF> Galactica
[09:26:23] <nFFF> whats your problem?
[09:26:29] <zoster> http://9gag.com/gag/4311517
[09:26:36] <zoster> that explains alot
[09:26:48] <nFFF> $.when(loadAccount()).done(function(response) { console.log(response); });
[09:27:38] <Galactica> it will responseText
[09:27:45] <Galactica> i need xhr-objec
[09:31:26] <ScottG> How can I set the background of a div and have that div show up without having any content in it?
[09:40:05] <Galactica> http://pastie.org/private/ihzxywvgd37yk9doqfona  more examples
[09:40:40] <zoster> did you set
[09:40:44] <zoster> async: false
[09:40:45] <zoster> ?
[09:41:36] <sekyms> Anyone give me a hand?
[09:41:37] <sekyms> http://pastebin.com/JBCaAuvS

[11:05:39] <ScottG> I'm trying to learn a little jquery by making a dynaic nav bar. I'm having trouble putting html elements inside other html elements, though. .html() doesn't seem to be working how I'd expect. Could someone take a look? http://privatepaste.com/1270588e19
[11:07:09] <Foo-Bar> ScottG: http://api.jquery.com/append/
[11:07:10] <Foo-Bar> ?
[11:07:32] <ravenzz> ScottG you would use Unordered List for navigation
[11:07:35] <ravenzz> usually
[11:07:44] <ravenzz> also IDs are unique
[11:07:46] <ScottG> Foo-Bar: I don't necessarily want to append. I want to replace
[11:07:53] <ravenzz> so you don't need to select #main_nav #stuff
[11:08:04] <ravenzz> $('#stuff') would be fine
[11:08:29] <ScottG> ravenzz: Right. There's a lot wrong with my conventions. I'm just trying to learn how things work right now.
[11:09:55] <ravenzz> also you should care about graceful degradation
[11:10:06] <ScottG> ravenzz: If you look at line 60 you see I'm trying to get .content.stuff's html and put it in #nav_menu #content
[11:10:16] <ravenzz> ScottG i would suggest you to start from this wsc.opera.com
[11:10:30] <ravenzz> and then read this http://jqfundamentals.com/
[11:10:31] <ScottG> ravenzz: I probably should. But right now I have a much more basic problem.
[11:10:54] <ravenzz> and in 10 days you'll have a good base to start with
[11:11:09] <ScottG> ravenzz: I already spent 10 days learning js.
[11:11:17] <ravenzz> maybe less than 10
[11:11:34] <ScottG> I could very well read through all of that and still not understand what I am doing wrong.
[11:11:38] <ravenzz> but it will be useful in the future
[11:11:43] <ravenzz> nah
[11:12:04] <ravenzz> then you can start with some basic exercises like the one you are trying to make
[11:12:10] <databack> Just apply a scrollFade to all selectors and call yourself an expert.
[11:12:29] <ScottG> ravenzz: I've already done basic exercises.
[11:13:02] <ravenzz> nevermind, it is about your knowledge not mine..
[11:13:04] <ScottG> ravenzz: The thing is, I"M new to this, and i'll still be new to this after I read and practice. I'm still going to mess up and need help here. And that's where I a now.
[11:13:10] <ravenzz> let's see what is wrong with that
[11:13:44] <ravenzz> btw you don't need an ID for everything
[11:13:56] <ScottG> sigh, I know...
[11:14:04] <ravenzz> :)
[11:14:16] <ravenzz> what are you trying to do?
[11:14:59] <ScottG> I'm essentially trying to move line 42-44 into the span on line 30
[11:15:02] <databack> $('#nav_menu #breadcrumb').html(
[11:15:05] <databack> $('#nav_menu #breadcrumb').html(
[11:15:07] <databack> $('#nav_menu #breadcrumb').html(
[11:15:09] <databack> $('#nav_menu #breadcrumb').html(
[11:15:10] <databack> h
[11:15:12] <databack> ahhhhhhhh
[11:15:16] <databack> sorry
[11:15:22] <ScottG> databack: Like I said, I'm new.
[11:15:42] <ScottG> But if you're complaining about the double id's I know it's redundant.
[11:15:56] <databack> well, yes, that too
[11:16:06] <ScottG> Lets just say I'm doing it to make my code more verbose right now.
[11:16:20] <databack> $(this).html()).append(' > '
[11:16:22] <databack> );
[11:16:27] <databack> that's the other part of it
[11:16:52] <ScottG> databack: So... what's wrong with that?
[11:17:25] <databack> I dont understand what you are trying to do. That's a random '>'
[11:17:48] <ScottG> databack: Have you tried looking at it in a browser?
[11:18:40] <ScottG> databack: http://jsfiddle.net/xsvgy/
[11:19:49] <gnarf> ?valid id
[11:19:55] * gnarf frowns
[11:20:09] * gnarf cries for bot-t 
[11:20:33] <gnarf> ScottG: mind repeating?
[11:21:16] <ScottG> gnarf: http://jsfiddle.net/xsvgy/ I'm trying to put an element inside another element.
[11:21:30] <mib_mib> hi guys, im trying to just inject jquery into the developer console at linkedin.com - but after i do var script = document.createElement('script');script.src = "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.3/jquery.min.js";document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);  and type $ it isn't jquery but some other function - can someone explain whats going on?
[11:21:45] <gnarf> ScottG: http://jsfiddle.net/xsvgy/1/ fixed your fiddle to actually be readable ;)
[11:22:05] <ScottG> gnarf: Thanks!
[11:22:23] <gnarf> ScottG: so what does "an element inside another element" mean exactly?
[11:22:40] <gnarf> cuz that sounds like element.appendTo( anotherElement ) to me
[11:23:03] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/appendTo
[11:23:42] <ravenzz> I understood what he is trying to do
[11:23:56] <ravenzz> ScottG i'll give you a fiddle in a minute
[11:24:18] <gnarf> ravenzz: right on
[11:24:33] <ScottG> gnarf: I'm not sure how to be more clear... Say I have <p></p> and <span>fasdf</span>
[11:24:51] <ScottG> gnarf: On some event I want to put the span inside 'p'
[11:24:56] <gnarf> seems like its gonna wanna be a .clone().appendTo() considering what I see in here trying to copy html around
[11:25:09] <gnarf> ScottG: do you want to MOVE the span into the p, or copy it into the p
[11:25:19] <gnarf> do you want to replace whats already in the p, or append/prepend to
[11:25:26] <ScottG> ghoti: so it looks like <p><span>fasdf</span></p>
[11:25:41] <gnarf> ScottG: all of these things are important :)
[11:26:00] <ScottG> ghoti: I want to copy and replace.
[11:26:14] <ScottG> gnarf: ^
[11:26:22] <databack> so just wrap your content inside .html
[11:26:25] <gnarf> ScottG: then you want to anotherElement.empty().append( element.clone() )
[11:26:43] <gnarf> ScottG: you can also use anotherElement.html( element.clone() )
[11:26:45] <gnarf> it does the same thing
[11:26:59] <gnarf> .html( x ) is shortcut for .empty().append( x )
[11:27:11] <databack> did not know that gnarf, but makes sense
[11:28:06] <ScottG> gnarf: In this case I don't really want to append. I want to replace what's in there
[11:28:13] <ScottG> But let me give that a shot
[11:28:16] <gnarf> ScottG: .empty() removes whats there...
[11:28:18] <gnarf> then append appends
[11:28:22] <gnarf> so that is "replacing" :)
[11:29:42] <gnarf> databack: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/manipulation.js#L247-249
[11:29:56] <ScottG> gnarf: Ah ok clone worked! I ned to do make it visible now I believe!
[11:29:58] <gnarf> databack: ignore the stuff above it, its not done if you are doing .html( jqueryResult )
[11:30:11] <gnarf> ScottG: anotherElement.html( element.clone().show() )
[11:30:32] <ScottG> gnarf: Just curious, why wouldn't the show come before clone?
[11:30:36] <zeta-> I'm trying to use selectable() from jq-ui but get error "not a function".
[11:30:37] <zeta-> the rest of js & jq is working
[11:31:05] <databack> not done?
[11:31:07] <gnarf> ScottG: cuz then you show the element before you clone it, meaning the "hidden" stuff will be shown
[11:31:27] <gnarf> databack: its only for parsing string html
[11:31:30] <ScottG> ah true.
[11:31:41] <thomedy> okay question... im running e.preventDefault in a click event
[11:31:48] <gnarf> databack: so if you do .html( somethingjQuery ) it skips all that regexp bullshit and just goes to .empty().append() :)
[11:31:53] <thomedy> and it works great but im trying to move away from anonymous functions
[11:31:56] <ScottG> gnarf: Hm, well I see that the content has been moved like I wanted. Still isn't showing up in the browser.
[11:31:57] <databack> right
[11:32:08] <ScottG> gnarf: By 'see' I mean in the chrome console.
[11:32:15] <thomedy> so named one and instead of just calling event(function () {})
[11:32:27] <databack> Is that not what he's trying to do?
[11:32:28] <thomedy> i called click(namedFunction(e))
[11:32:38] <gnarf> ScottG: might depend on how you have it hidden...
[11:32:41] <thomedy> but it doesn't work if i call a named funciton
[11:33:02] <gnarf> ScottG: update that fiddle and mayube someone else can help, I gotta wander over to another place here soon...
[11:33:03] <ScottG> gnarf: I have the class set to visibility: hidden
[11:33:11] <gnarf> ScottG: use disaply: none
[11:33:16] <ScottG> gnarf: Ok. thanks so far!
[11:33:23] <gnarf> ScottG: .hide() and .show() use display not visibility
[11:33:35] <ScottG> gnarf: perfect! Thanks!
[11:33:38] <JonYoder> Hey! I'm trying to disable my image lightbox when I click a button. So far my efforts to use ('script#lightbox').remove(); hasn't worked.
[11:33:43] <JonYoder> Working page: http://www.jonyoder.com/testblog/2012/02/loneliness-fiftytwo/
[11:34:01] <gnarf> ScottG: np - good luck :)
[11:34:06] <gnarf> afk
[11:37:20] <ravenzz> ScottG http://jsfiddle.net/enNZF/ ?
[11:38:26] <ravenzz> http://jsfiddle.net/enNZF/1/
[11:38:27] <ScottG> ravenzz: Kinda, yeah.
[11:39:13] <ravenzz> anyway if it is just an exercise it is ok. Otherwise it doen't make a lot of sense
[11:39:26] <ravenzz> you do breadcrumbs on backend usually
[11:39:30] <ScottG> ravenzz: It's kinda an exercise.
[11:39:38] <ScottG> Yeah.
[11:39:50] <ravenzz> the "main" link is always clickable..otherwise you won't be able to reach the /stuffs page
[11:39:52] <ravenzz> never.
[11:40:49] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/unUqS/1/
[11:40:56] <thomedy> okay why cant i call a named funciton
[11:41:55] <thomedy> i saw a $.functionname =  function() {} is that the correct way to call a function... its different if thats the case and i guess thats fine
[11:42:11] <thomedy> sorry the correct way to declare a function
[11:42:31] <ravenzz> ScottG if you need something hidden that will be displayed with JS...hide it with JS
[11:42:36] <ravenzz> instead of css
[11:45:22] <ScottG> ravenzz: OK, I'll remember that.
[11:47:23] <ProLoser|Mac> Hey guys
[11:47:34] <ProLoser|Mac> This is a WIP but I thought you guys would find it interesting: https://github.com/ProLoser/Rotary-Datepicker
[11:47:39] <ProLoser|Mac> It's totally badass
[11:48:02] <ProLoser|Mac> click on the project URL to check out a prototype
[11:51:50] <thomedy> excuse me i can call preventDefault without a custom named function but when i write it into a named function for example var dont_link = function(e) {}
[11:51:54] <thomedy> it doesn't work
[11:52:07] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/unUqS/4/
[11:55:39] <Whirl3d> that's bedcause you aren't using the jquery event model to fire your plugin...if you want to enable that feature, you have to include it in your plugin definition....e.preventDefault=function () {don't do stuff}, I think
[11:56:08] <thomedy> whoa im writing a plugin
[11:56:10] <thomedy> neet
[11:56:11] <thomedy> neat
[11:56:52] <thomedy> it seems so simple how is this considered a plug in im just wanting to call a function
[11:57:06] <zeta-> I'm trying to use selectable() from jq-ui but get error "not a function".
[11:57:07] <zeta-> The rest of js & jq is working -- do I need s'thing else to say 'use jq-ui'?
[11:57:13] <Whirl3d> it's not unless you extend the jquery object with it
[11:58:15] <Whirl3d> $.plugin=function () {do something}    defines a plugin because it extends the jquery object. Or $.fn.plugin=function () { } also extends the jQuery object...more specifically the jqery.fn object
[11:58:39] <thomedy> you know what ill do..  i should google hwo to write a plug in that seems the way to go
[11:58:43] <thomedy> do you agree
[11:58:55] <Whirl3d> but the logic is the same. Jquery has it's own set of native events and an events model that ensures that all the events have the same resources.
[11:59:05] <thomedy> makes sense
[11:59:14] <thomedy> that must be how everyone is writing plug ins
[11:59:25] <Whirl3d> http://bitovi.com/blog/2010/10/writing-the-perfect-jquery-plugin.html
[11:59:49] <thomedy> thank you
[12:00:08] <Whirl3d> zeta, it's hard to tell without seeing your code. Can you make a jsfiddle to demonstrate the error you are receiving.
[12:00:30] <Whirl3d> It's possible that you aren't loading jquery UI at the time that the function loads?
[12:02:13] <Whirl3d> Or perhaps the script you are using is expecting a function and instead, you are providing a resolved function (which is usually a value of sorts--only occasionally is that value, itself, a function--but that's another topic)...so if you enter:    myFunction('apples');   that's not a function, it's a value..
[12:02:35] <zeta-> Whirl3d: I'm using Drupal, and jq-ui is in the page after jq and before my function
[12:02:58] <Whirl3d> cool. then what is the line that is throwing the error?
[12:03:43] <zeta-> $('.dynamic > label').selectable({ distance: 20 });
[12:04:15] <thomedy> zeta your using drupal?
[12:04:34] <thomedy> what are you doing
[12:04:47] <thomedy> with drupal what are you making how involved are you in the drupal process
[12:04:49] <zeta-> inside jQuery(document).ready(function ($) {
[12:05:36] <Whirl3d> zeta what is the exact error?
[12:05:42] <zeta-> thomedy: been using drupal for several years -- now writing amodule
[12:05:58] <thomedy> cool... i do all that too..
[12:06:07] <thomedy> i am learning how to write jquery plug ins now though
[12:06:17] <thomedy> i write mods, build themes the whole thing
[12:06:26] <thomedy> i havent been using it for years though i have been using it for year
[12:06:28] <zeta-> TypeError: $(".dynamic > label").selectable is not a function
[12:06:34] <thomedy> a little over though...
[12:07:16] <Whirl3d> yeah. It sounds like you don't have jquery UI selectable module loaded..
[12:08:25] <zeta-> Whirl3d: How do i load it? is it a separate .js file?
[12:08:46] <zeta-> thomedy: 8)
[12:09:11] <Whirl3d> it requires the modules   UI.Core, UI.Widget, UI.Mouse...
[12:10:38] <thomedy> in jquery can i write bools
[12:10:53] <thomedy> or is every variable an anything and js decides for you
[12:11:10] <thomedy> so bool switched = true; or var switched = true
[12:12:01] <zeta-> Whirl3d: dependencies. but there is nothing in the demo source :-s
[12:12:20] <zeta-> download links?
[12:12:51] <Whirl3d> http://jqueryui.com/download
[12:15:36] <zeta-> Whirl3d: thanks! -- it's more complicated than I thought
[12:17:19] <Whirl3d> thomedy, to the best of my knowledge, there is no bool in jQuery...It's var boolvar=true;
[12:17:47] <thomedy> yeah i just tried it out
[12:17:51] <thomedy>  i miss my var types
[12:17:53] <thomedy> but its okay
[12:18:04] <thomedy> i dont know why i miss em its just weird for me
[12:19:28] <JonYoder> I'm having troubles disabling some javascript in the <head>. So far my efforts to use ('script#lightbox').remove(); hasn't worked.
[12:19:38] <JonYoder> The page I'm working on: http://www.jonyoder.com/testblog/2012/02/loneliness-fiftytwo/
[12:19:47] <Whirl3d> does anyone know if you can use the jquery.Event object to define custom events?
[12:20:32] <Whirl3d> ('script#lightbox') doesn't look like jquery to me...
[12:21:07] <Whirl3d> jquery is predicated by a $ or jQuery    so perhaps you mean $("#lightbox").remove();
[12:21:32] <fka> Hey buddies, in Istanbul, we  organize an event about JavaScript named jstanbul. If you want to join as a speaker, please submit: jstanbul.org :)
[12:23:29] <ProLoser|Mac> thomedy: did you fix your problem?
[12:24:21] <thomedy> i havent getten the chance to look up how to write a plug in yet cuz im so busy
[12:24:23] <thomedy> no
[12:24:27] <ProLoser|Mac> domready
[12:24:33] <ProLoser|Mac> not onload
[12:24:37] <ProLoser|Mac> that's why it's not working
[12:25:10] <thomedy> me?
[12:25:14] <ProLoser|Mac> yes
[12:25:22] <thomedy> are you lookin g at my jsfiddle
[12:25:25] <ProLoser|Mac> i was
[12:25:26] <thomedy> cuz it says document.ready
[12:25:30] <thomedy> am i wrong?
[12:25:33] <thomedy> maybe im wrogn
[12:25:39] <ProLoser|Mac> link me again
[12:25:50] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/unUqS/4/
[12:26:11] <ProLoser|Mac> i don't know if that works
[12:26:15] <thomedy> yeah...
[12:26:20] <ProLoser|Mac> but you should choose 'ondomReady' in the top left corner
[12:26:23] <ProLoser|Mac> and remove your document.ready
[12:26:52] <ProLoser|Mac> weird, was working for me
[12:26:53] <Whirl3d> regardless, you have to define the function before you can use a reference to it.
[12:26:54] <ProLoser|Mac> nvm iunno
[12:27:12] <Whirl3d> because the doc ready fires after the function is referenced
[12:27:14] <thomedy> ive always just run anonymous functions
[12:27:26] <ProLoser|Mac> Whirl3d: ah ya that didn't occur to me
[12:27:28] <thomedy> but i would like to move into named functions the more i learn about jquery and waht not
[12:27:37] <ProLoser|Mac> if you had done function whatever() it would have been hoisted
[12:27:43] <ProLoser|Mac> but you did $var = function
[12:27:43] <Whirl3d> which wouldn't happen if the left panel indicated domReady, btw.
[12:28:10] <ProLoser|Mac> bottom line is your'e just doing it wrong lol
[12:28:39] <ProLoser|Mac> you guys want to see something pretty cool i'm working on?
[12:28:41] <thomedy> http://jsfiddle.net/unUqS/5/
[12:28:43] <ProLoser|Mac> you have to have webkit though
[12:28:45] <thomedy> this is my instink
[12:28:49] <thomedy> instinct
[12:28:55] <thomedy> but this seems wrong by its result
[12:29:34] <thomedy> i very well could do this whole thing with anonymous functions
[12:29:39] <thomedy> but that doesn't seem very professional
[12:29:46] <Whirl3d> proLoser, you are the author of anythingSlider, right?
[12:29:54] <ProLoser|Mac> anonymouse functions != professional?
[12:30:03] <Whirl3d> closure ftw
[12:30:05] <ProLoser|Mac> Whirl3d: i am one of the contributors
[12:30:12] <thomedy> is that a surprised question  or are you agreeing with me
[12:30:12] <ProLoser|Mac> it's had a lot of authors though
[12:30:19] <ProLoser|Mac> what's up?
[12:30:23] <Whirl3d> cool. I'd love to see what you are working on
[12:30:31] <ProLoser|Mac> thomedy: how savvy are you with js?
[12:30:38] <ProLoser|Mac> do you have chrome?
[12:30:46] <ProLoser|Mac> i have yet to add -moz- to my prototype apparently lol
[12:30:51] <ProLoser|Mac> or-webkit- i mean
[12:30:51] <Whirl3d> <--has chrome
[12:30:56] <ProLoser|Mac> http://proloser.github.com/Rotary-Datepicker/
[12:31:01] <ProLoser|Mac> keep in mind it's a WIP
[12:31:10] <thomedy> im hoping to move more into js and less into jquery cuz im very comfortable with c++ and java... not the same but im more accustomed to code and jquery sometimes feels like basic
[12:31:14] <thomedy> the language
[12:31:29] <thomedy> and i do have chrome
[12:31:38] <ProLoser|Mac> thomedy: if you want to understand the fundamentals of JS and where it can be confusing as fuck checkout javascript garden
[12:31:41] <Whirl3d> jquery is js, btw
[12:31:48] <ProLoser|Mac> http://bonsaiden.github.com/JavaScript-Garden/
[12:32:00] <thomedy> right jquery is js
[12:32:09] <thomedy> but i just feel more comfortable writing my own animations
[12:32:15] <thomedy> and what not i need creative control
[12:32:22] <thomedy> but jquery does make it so much easier and htats nice
[12:32:22] <ProLoser|Mac> i don't do js animations anymore :/
[12:32:35] <Whirl3d> ProLoser|Mac, very nice datepicker. You could do some cool transforms with the text make them rotate in 3 d outside the selector window...
[12:32:55] <ProLoser|Mac> what do you mean?
[12:33:05] <ProLoser|Mac> did you try scrolling with it :)
[12:33:09] <ProLoser|Mac> it's not just mouse clicks
[12:33:15] <ProLoser|Mac> you'll also be able to use it on a touch device
[12:33:16] <thomedy> are named functions over rated though proloser is that what you were getting at with your anonymous function algorithm
[12:33:34] <Whirl3d> it needs to be draggable, but yes the scrolling is great. It's a great concept
[12:33:46] <ProLoser|Mac> what were you thinking it would do in 3d?
[12:33:56] <ProLoser|Mac> thomedy: anonymous functions are not unprofessional
[12:34:22] <Whirl3d> if you imagine that your datepicker was a column date picker, with one radius=0 and one radius=300 for example, it might be cool looking
[12:34:35] <ProLoser|Mac> i'm not syaing you need to use em for EVERYTHING, but needlessly naming a function when you only ever use it in 1 place is unnecessary
[12:34:53] <ProLoser|Mac> i need to see a picture :/
[12:34:58] <fka> ProLoser|Mac: thomedy: Who says anon funcs are unprofessional? :S
[12:35:11] <ProLoser|Mac> fka: scroll up
[12:35:14] <Whirl3d> ProLoser|Mac, brb with one
[12:35:16] <fka> The JS is all anon functions. :S
[12:35:21] <ProLoser|Mac> Whirl3d: hang on
[12:35:22] <zeta-> Whirl3d: thanks -- working now
[12:35:53] <ProLoser|Mac> https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1azNwDwcLDpz7SzD7M3Qh_AbrXQOApVqKwGZCfU6MbUs/edit
[12:35:56] <ProLoser|Mac> @Whirl3d
[12:36:00] <ProLoser|Mac> i like using that stuff
[12:36:35] <JonYoder> Whirl3d: hey! Sorry I didn't see your reply. I had tried jQuery("#lightbox").remove(); and it didn't touch the tag inside the <head>
[12:37:23] <thomedy> really
[12:37:28] <thomedy> i just read the anon function thing
[12:37:42] <fka> $dont_link should be before document.ready
[12:37:51] <thomedy> i assumed that it would be beneficial and im more accustomed to writing functions out and then calling thme
[12:37:58] <fka> because javascript part is not the document
[12:38:08] <thomedy> but if it doesn't affect anything negatively then whatever i guess
[12:38:59] <fka> It's a choice but, http://jsfiddle.net/unUqS/5/ this won't work
[12:39:16] <fka> you run a function and result is not a function
[12:40:03] <fka> thomedy: It should be: http://jsfiddle.net/unUqS/6/
[12:40:12] <ProLoser|Mac> Whirl3d: i'm stepping out, send me a pm with your result
[12:40:37] <thomedy> awesome thank you so much
[12:40:45] <thomedy> i wasn't quite sure how that would work
[12:41:24] <thomedy> i actually thought i tried that version but i appreciate it
[12:41:30] <thomedy> thats how it looks like it should go...
[12:41:31] <fka> Because you bind a function to the click event doesn't created yet.
[12:41:36] <fka> first create, then bind.
[12:41:39] <thomedy> okay...
[12:41:48] <thomedy> and all this stuff will work with .live, or on right
[12:42:02] <fka> yes.
[12:42:18] <fka> "first create, then bind" work for all :)
[12:43:30] <thomedy> hmmm... i really thought i tried that but you fixed me
[12:43:32] <thomedy> thank you again
[12:44:13] <thomedy> great im good
[12:44:31] <fka> No problem :)
[12:44:31] <JonYoder> Does jQuery limit the changing of elements inside the head? Or other scripts?
[12:45:02] <fka> JonYoder: Can you explain more what you want to learn?
[12:45:40] <JonYoder> Well I'm trying to use $("#headScript").remove(); but nothing is happening.
[12:45:41] <laszlof> JonYoder: what elements are you trying to change?
[12:46:04] <laszlof> i dont think the script tag has an "id" so that wouldnt be valid.
[12:46:13] <JonYoder> ohh...that would make sense.
[12:46:36] <JonYoder> What would be the best way of selecting this certain script? (lightbox plugin)
[12:46:45] <fka> script tags can have ID, maybe not valid but jquery can handle them.
[12:46:54] <laszlof> fka: really?
[12:46:59] <laszlof> didnt know that
[12:47:14] <fka> Yep. I use script tags as template containers for Backbone.
[12:47:14] <laszlof> JonYoder: theres probably a better way to do what you want to do
[12:47:19] <systemfault> Of course script tags can have ids.
[12:47:42] <JonYoder> If you guys wanna see what I'm working on -> http://www.jonyoder.com/testblog/2012/03/smiling-every-week/
[12:47:47] <JonYoder> The Crazy button.
[12:48:11] <JonYoder> The black lightbox comes up when you click the image although I disabled the link.
[12:48:43] <laszlof> why dont you just disable the lightbox on whatever element
[12:49:12] <JonYoder> Well I like it with the smaller images, but not with this weird script I made.
[12:49:29] <laszlof> so just disable it on the larger images
[12:50:16] <JonYoder> I don't know how to do that. I'm trying to figure out a way to disable it without disabling it all the time.
[12:51:02] <laszlof> JonYoder: google seems to think that adding rel="NON" to the image will do it
[12:51:06] <fka> removing script element won't change anything, because browser will run them once.
[12:51:15] <laszlof> yeah, what he said
[12:51:30] <JonYoder> laszlof: thanks! I'll do that.
[12:52:02] <laszlof> JonYoder: heres the source if you're wondering: http://wordpress.org/support/topic/disable-lightbox-on-specific-images-or-entire-page
[12:53:57] <JonYoder> Thanks...although it seems as though lightbox filters all the images when the page loads. I bet removing href (which I have been doing) would have done the same thing as rel='NON'
[12:54:47] <laszlof> JonYoder: it sounds like the plugin for wordpress automatically adds rel="lightbox" to the images
[12:54:56] <laszlof> which tells the lightbox plugin to act on it
[12:55:08] <laszlof> by adding rel="NON" it basically overwrites that functionality
[12:55:30] <laszlof> but yeah, theres probably a few ways to do it
[12:55:40] <JonYoder> True. It doesn't seem to like that being changed after page load though.
[13:01:49] <ProLoser|Mac> Whirl3d: where's the sketch?
[13:04:32] <Whirl3d> http://imgur.com/C3ki2
[13:04:47] <Whirl3d> Terrible quality cause I rushed it
[13:05:04] <Whirl3d> lol, but the idea it conveys could be achieved with some transforms to your text.
[13:08:06] <Whirl3d> oh, I just saw your link. Exactly. LOL
[13:13:33] <JonYoder> Thanks for the help laszlof! I couldn't figure out to remove the code like I wanted to, but I changed the lightbox CSS to not black out the page when you click.
[13:19:02] <laszlof> JonYoder: cool.
[13:21:06] <JonYoder> What do you guys think of the idea of reloading images and making them bigger? From a web developers standpoint...is it worth using? (top right crazy button) http://www.jonyoder.com/testblog/2012/03/beautiful-things/
[13:21:59] <JonYoder> I doubt it's very browser compliant, but I haven't seen it done before and wanted to figure it out.
[13:22:18] <Kitu> hello
[13:22:38] <laszlof> JonYoder: isnt that what lightbox is for? :)
[13:22:59] <Kitu> is it possible to load JS before $(document).ready ?
[13:23:33] <laszlof> why would you want to?
[13:23:56] <Kitu> it's complicated ...
[13:24:00] <JonYoder> laszlof: kind of. ;) But I didn't know if anyone was using it and I don't like that it only works when the page is fully loaded.
[13:24:34] <FernandoBasso> Could someone give me a hint please? http://www.webdeveloper.com/forum/showthread.php?p=1211311#post1211311
[13:24:57] <laszlof> Kitu: typically you need to wait for the DOM to load before being able to do anything useful
[13:25:31] <laszlof> FernandoBasso: whats not working?
[13:25:32] <Kitu> I have <noscript> and I want load html if javascript is OK, so I do a ajax request to load my html, but after my JS functions don't work on this HTML loaded by ajax
[13:26:00] <Kitu> (sorry I'm french :)
[13:26:14] <FernandoBasso> laszlof: I can't make the return data from the php function to be placed inside a DOM element (with .html) or alert it...
[13:26:27] <laszlof> Kitu: I think you're confusing $(document).ready() with $(window).ready
[13:26:45] <laszlof> FernandoBasso: use the success or complete function
[13:27:00] <Kitu> $(window).ready it's before $(document).ready() ?
[13:27:06] <laszlof> no
[13:27:25] <laszlof> window.ready loads after the html and dom have been loaded. document.ready is after dom, but before page contents
[13:28:12] <laszlof> FernandoBasso: http://jsfiddle.net/LHsk4/
[13:28:20] <laszlof> something like that
[13:29:07] <Kitu> the problem it's that I have topics('<?php echo urldecode($_GET['topics']); ?>'); So I can't put this code in my javascript file
[13:29:49] <FernandoBasso> laszlof: I had tried (and actually tried again now). All I get is an empty alert window.
[13:29:53] <Kitu> because there is PHP
[13:30:49] <laszlof> FernandoBasso: check the status
[13:30:53] <sarspazam> can anyone remember that canvas thing that reveals images by hovering over circles?
[13:31:03] <laszlof> success: function(data, status) { alert(status); }
[13:31:10] <sarspazam> each hover meaning the circle splits into more circles revealing more detail...?
[13:32:02] <FernandoBasso> laszlof: success.
[13:32:18] <laszlof> perhaps your PHP isnt returning HTML as you expected
[13:33:11] <FernandoBasso> http://gotek.no-ip.org:8080/Ajax/one_jQuery/ (my local host).
[13:34:02] <laszlof> FernandoBasso: you have 2 success events
[13:34:18] <FernandoBasso> yeah, sorry. Please reload.
[13:35:58] <laszlof> FernandoBasso: your script is returning a blank response
[13:36:02] <laszlof> (the php script)
[13:38:15] <FernandoBasso> Well, it works if I change the return "some data" with echo "some data" in my php script.
[13:40:10] <FernandoBasso> Should it work with a return in php instead of an echo() ?
[13:40:30] <laszlof> no
[13:40:41] <FernandoBasso> Why not?
[13:40:54] <laszlof> because return only works within the scope of the PHP script
[13:41:14] <laszlof> you need to print/echo the data
[13:41:22] <FernandoBasso> But how will I avoid having my php echoing things left and right?
[13:41:42] <laszlof> if you want to use ajax, thats how it has to work
[13:42:15] <FernandoBasso> Well, I guess I'll just have to writhe methods/functions to be called and echo/print things only on the right moment.
[13:42:31] <laszlof> you're better off having it return an object and then parsing the object in jquery
[13:42:44] <laszlof> rather than printing html
[13:43:04] <FernandoBasso> Like json or something else?
[13:43:08] <laszlof> yes, json
[13:43:35] <laszlof> echo json_encode(array('name'=>'foo', 'phone'=>'111-222-3333'));
[13:43:55] <laszlof> then in your success event, you can process those with "data.name" and data.phone"
[13:44:03] <laszlof> obviously you'll need to change your dataType
[13:44:32] <FernandoBasso> Thanks. That is solved. How to make <a href='#?var=value' be passed with $.post/$.get/$.ajax to the php script?
[13:45:06] <laszlof> dont use href :)
[13:45:39] <FernandoBasso> What to do instead, then?
[13:46:15] <laszlof> <a href="javascript:;" data-key="somevalue" id="ajax">Foo</a>
[13:46:38] <laszlof> then in your .click event, do var name = $(this).attr('data-key');
[13:48:13] <FernandoBasso> Thanks a bunch. I'm play around with this new information. You were very helpful.
[13:48:28] <FernandoBasso> s/I'm/I'll/
[15:21:56] <darrennnn> this is probably a simple question. i am trying to get the class "foo" onto the appended div http://jsfiddle.net/v2nVM/
[15:22:17] <darrennnn> if you read the comment i know the easy way but i am trying to just understand the chaining and how it works
[15:24:59] <lampe2> hey i got some dives with the classname .group and this div contains some h3 strings and divs. but ever .group div has this how can i get the values from this with a each() ?
[15:27:02] <darrennnn> what are you trying to find? the h3s?
[15:29:32] <lampe2> darrennnn, the h3 contains a "a" and this "a" an "input" and i wann the value of the input !?
[15:30:25] <darrennnn> $(".group h3 a input").each(function(){ $(this).val() }); ?
[15:30:41] <darrennnn> just a guess, i am no pro here.
[15:31:24] <darrennnn> thats some crazy html btw.
[15:31:52] <darrennnn> an <input> in an <a> in a <h3> ?
[15:32:11] <asaelko> ^^ lol
[15:32:14] <lampe2> its crazy cause of jquery ui :)
[15:32:23] <darrennnn> i find that hard to believe, but okay
[15:32:33] <lampe2> the <a> is cause its clickable
[15:32:39] <darrennnn> everything is clickable.
[15:33:01] <darrennnn> $("input").click(function(){ dostuff });
[15:33:53] <darrennnn> btw my question up there is still open if anyone can provide insight. ty
[15:39:21] <raj> how does adding `show: 'slow'` to .dialog()'s option screw with the css?
[15:43:38] <darrennnn> dead in here
[15:43:41] <darrennnn> i guess ill have to come back
[15:46:13] <chilversc> darrennnn: the chaining normally always returns the same item
[15:46:48] <chilversc> darrennnn: so that you can do things like; $("#links").append(item1).append(item2); and have them both appened to #links, rather than item2 appended to item1
[15:47:18] <darrennnn> okay
[15:47:30] <darrennnn> so then is it not possible to accomplish what i wanted to do?
[15:47:37] <darrennnn> i think of it like
[15:47:42] <chilversc> darrennnn: so you're standard option here is to do something like; var foo = $("<div>append</div>").class("foo");
[15:47:48] <darrennnn> y = x += 5
[15:48:12] <darrennnn> err y+=x+=5
[15:48:27] <darrennnn> oh okay i see what youre saying.
[15:48:43] <chilversc> darrennnn: but you have an exact example of how to do this inline in your own sample
[15:49:01] <darrennnn> so $("#links").append($(item).addclass(class));
[15:49:09] <chilversc> darrennnn: ie, .append($("<div>append</div>").class("foo"))
[15:49:14] <darrennnn> gotttt it.
[15:49:17] <darrennnn> okay
[15:49:24] <darrennnn> so its like nesting really
[15:49:26] <darrennnn> not chaining
[15:49:31] <chilversc> darrennnn: but I don't like to nest it that much normally, since it gets awkward to read, hence the use of intermediate values
[15:49:43] <darrennnn> the var you mean
[15:49:43] <darrennnn> ?
[15:49:49] <chilversc> darrennnn: yeah
[15:50:01] <darrennnn> okay. that helps my understanding greatly. ty chilversc
[15:50:05] <darrennnn> thats all i needed.
[15:50:44] <chilversc> darrennnn: chaining normally always operates on the same item repeatedly, except in a some specific cases (ie, when using the traversing methods such as .closest)
[16:12:47] <hye> Hi, I am using Jquery 'each' function when a user 'clicks' on an element.  On the 'each' function I use a selector to determine what to loop through.  But in that code when I use $(this) it refers to the element that is clicked on, and not the individual rows the each function is iterating through.  Any ideas how to approach this?
[16:15:36] <shoky> o
[16:16:05] <Whirl3d> shoky! Hey man, you get some zzzs?
[16:16:48] <shoky> yoo
[16:16:51] <shoky> i think so !
[16:17:04] <shoky> ohh , yeah
[16:17:27] <shoky> whats up
[16:19:01] <Whirl3d> just listening to liquorice by Azealia Banks on Pandora...it's hilarious..
[16:19:27] <hye> we dont care what your listening to
[16:19:35] <shoky> can't pandora in .il ; <
[16:20:04] <Whirl3d> drats.  hye, in fact, shoky asked "what's up" so cope
[16:20:24] <hye> go blog or something
[16:20:53] <shoky> hye solving your problem is easy
[16:21:03] <Whirl3d> and to think I was offering to help you with your issue once you setup a fiddle. Funny how people turn out...
[16:21:18] <hye> i dont need help from people who lack irc ettiquete
[16:23:40] <lampe2> hey iam working with google maps. is there a way to call a google map event like the click action on a marker from a button from outside ?
[16:23:41] <shoky> Whirl3d can you elaborate on your pandora experience
[16:24:07] <shoky> i am making a jquery plugin about it so it's imperative that you go into detail
[16:24:16] <hye> lampe2 define outside
[16:24:34] <Whirl3d> lol. Shoky, I was just going to ask you about that.
[16:24:51] <lampe2> hye, i got a button in a panel and from this button should call the google map event click
[16:25:11] <hye> define panel
[16:25:45] <lampe2> panel = div tag
[16:26:02] <shoky> lawl
[16:26:07] <hye> well you just need to use jquery selector to target the button in the panel and execute the function
[16:26:16] <Whirl3d> shoky, can you proxy pandora?
[16:26:45] <shoky> i remember seeing ways to do it, yeah
[16:26:46] <hye> hi sarro
[16:26:51] <shoky> dont remember if i tried myself
[16:28:07] <Whirl3d> downloading glype proxy right now. I'll get it setup and pm you the link.
[16:28:39] <lampe2> my problem is i got google map markers and i wanne delete them from outside from a list but i cant select the right button cause there is no method selectbyid or select or something like that
[16:28:57] <shoky> heh thanx
[16:30:10] <hye> lampe2 you should read up on the google maps api documentation, it should give you access to functions that you can call which will do that for you
[16:30:44] <lampe2> hye, i was looking into the doc but i cant find such a function
[16:31:10] <hye> lampe2 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2973592/removing-google-map-markers-using-jquery
[16:32:45] <lampe2> hye found that too. i dont wanne make an array of marker
[16:33:11] <hye> look at the clearMarkers function
[16:33:22] <hye> it should serve as some sort of stepping stone for you
[16:34:46] <lampe2> hye he is iterating over an array. I dont got any array so this dont helps me
[16:35:10] <hye> you need the marker index
[16:35:13] <hye> then you call markers[i].setMap(null);
[16:35:18] <hye> where i is the marker index ID
[16:36:24] <lampe2> hye, he is doing this: var markers = new Array(); <<< i dont got an array so no index
[16:37:01] <hye> trial and error
[16:37:07] <hye> what do you have?
[16:37:09] <hye> do u know?
[16:37:16] <hye> read the docs there is millions of stuff on it
[16:46:10] <Vooloo> I have an iframe inside a modal, and get a really odd behavior in Chrome. When I scroll the iframe white lines appear on the iframed page.
[16:46:48] <lotus> Vooloo, upgrade your video card drivers perhaps?
[16:47:00] <Vooloo> it doesn't happen in IE
[16:47:07] <lotus> Vooloo, maybe show a working example and I can see if it happens for me
[16:47:28] <lotus> Vooloo, also, I like how this is backwards :)  It works in ie!
[16:51:03] <Vooloo> lotus: pastebin.com/tLkSqckB
[16:51:28] <lotus> Vooloo, I was hopiong more for a jsfiddle..
[16:51:36] <lotus> Vooloo, or a live example
[16:51:47] <lotus> Vooloo, I'll look though
[16:52:55] <lotus> vooloo I don't see any white lines
[16:53:03] <lotus> http://jsfiddle.net/a4aZk/
[16:53:31] <lotus> Vooloo, it's your hardware.  Try just loading a normal iframe in chrome and scrolling it
[16:53:39] <lotus> I bet you've got too many programs open or something.
[16:53:44] <Vooloo> changing to googles jquery made it go away
[16:53:47] <NaN> I have a json file (checked with jsonlint) but when I load it with $.getJSON I get an "invalid label" error... why?
[16:55:16] <lotus> NaN, could you show code // json output?
[16:56:41] <NaN> lotus: json > https://dl.dropbox.com/u/4613300/org2.json
[16:59:31] <lotus> NaN, it's not giving me "invalid label" but it is giving me null http://jsfiddle.net/zKt9Y/
[17:00:47] <NaN> lotus: why could be the problem?
[17:01:55] <NaN> jsonlint says its valid JSON
[17:02:47] <lotus> mmm not sure sec
[17:02:52] <Vooloo> is it better to use google jquery?
[17:03:01] <Whirl3d> shoky, if you wanna try to proxy through my server, pm me and I'll provide the url
[17:03:05] <chilversc> that isn't json, that's javascript there
[17:03:27] <chilversc> you can't parse a javascript object with JSON.parse, only a JSON string
[17:03:52] <chilversc> lotus: to that is
[17:03:55] <NaN> chilversc: if it's not a json, why jsonlint tells me that it is?
[17:05:11] <systemfault> Lawlz.. le troll
[17:05:52] <NaN> Vooloo: it's better if you don't want to waste your server bandwidth but depend on google ones
[17:07:07] <NaN> chilversc: with that structure/data, how could it be a real json?
[17:07:09] <lotus> NaN, what he's saying is that you need to wrap that json in a string iirc
[17:07:16] <chilversc> NaN: I wonder if it could be to do with an invalid content-type header
[17:07:54] <chilversc> NaN: are you serving up the request with the header; Content-Type: text/json; charset=utf-8 ?
[17:07:59] <lotus> NaN,  $.parseJSON('{"attr":"val"}'); as opposed to $.parseJSON({"attr":"val"});
[17:08:07] <lotus> NaN, my bad
[17:08:08] <chilversc> NaN: obviously, replace charset=utf-8 with what ever encoding you're using
[17:08:21] <tw2113> is NaN trying to server the json from the dropbox folder?
[17:08:29] <tw2113> or is he just using it to show it?
[17:08:34] <chilversc> NaN: also, if you are using utf-8, maybe check there's no BOM at the start?
[17:09:15] <NaN> tw2113: it was just to show it
[17:09:33] <tw2113> just checking for everyone
[17:09:34] <NaN> ok I will
[17:10:35] <NaN> yep, it's utf-8 without BOM
[17:14:33] <NaN> chilversc: isn't the real content type for json files application/json?
[17:16:03] <chilversc> NaN: yeah, but I've had trouble with some browsers not handling that correctly
[17:18:22] <chilversc> NaN: not a problem if you're users are all on ie 9 (not sure about ie 8) http://www.entwicklungsgedanken.de/2008/06/06/problems-with-internet-explorer-and-applicationjson/
[17:18:33] <chilversc> NaN: but if you have ie 7 users then it will cause problems
[17:18:51] <chilversc> though I use text/json rather than text/javascript
[17:20:18] <NaN> I tried the string as json on jsfidle and the error continues look > http://jsfiddle.net/zKt9Y/5/
[17:20:35] <NaN> that way is not a mime type problem
[17:21:58] <chilversc> NaN: odd, JSON.parse doesn't like it either, and that's a native browser implementation
[17:25:20] <systemfault> JSON isn't javascript...
[17:25:28] <systemfault> That works http://jsfiddle.net/zKt9Y/6/
[17:25:30] <tw2113> http://www.bennadel.com/blog/557-JSON-Unterminated-String-Literal-Error.htm
[17:26:09] <tw2113> systemfault and i got to the same result essentially
[17:27:45] <NaN> systemfault: yes it work's, what did you do?
[17:27:54] <tw2113> NaN read the link i just posted
[17:27:55] <systemfault> Removed the line feeds.
[17:28:00] <NaN> ok ok
[17:29:15] <NaN> I get it, let my try it on my dev server
[17:29:17] <NaN> :D
[17:30:23] <systemfault> Not sure how you got that problem… since the JSON is supposed to be generated..
[17:30:37] <NaN> same "invalid label" error =/
[17:30:39] <systemfault> If you use PHP.. you would use json_encode
[17:30:55] <NaN> no, the json was generated by hand
[17:31:10] <systemfault> That's the problem ;)
[17:31:18] <NaN> with the help of jsonlint and a json formatter
[17:31:49] <NaN> now the json is just 1 line, no line breaks, and I still get the "invalid label" error
[17:31:53] <chilversc> well that was valid JSON, since JSON can contain new lines
[17:32:21] <systemfault> Perhaps you have an invisible character at the end of the file.
[17:32:55] <chilversc> I was thinking invisible character at the start, such as a BOM
[17:33:08] <tw2113> i thought once
[17:33:14] <tw2113> didn't like it, so i stopped
[17:40:09] <amh345> is there a way to only apply a basetag to images and not everything?  it's adding to my form and it's not submitting correctly
[17:42:46] <chilversc> amh345: no
[17:44:30] <teear> hoho
[17:44:45] <teear> applies to all
[17:44:50] <amh345> well that kind of screws me right up
[17:45:34] <chilversc> I don't see why, if you can generate a base tag, then you can just generate full urls for the images
[17:45:38] <teear> What would you wan't to do with that base tag anyway?
[17:46:23] <amh345> im building paths to external static template that cannot be edited.
[17:47:01] <teear> Would you answer my question
[17:47:01] <amh345> it all worked fine. until i tried using amazons s3.  and becasue i have to set my basetag to that. it's also hitting the form. it didnt happen when the base path was on local
[17:47:13] <amh345> amh345: im building paths to external static template that cannot be edited.
[17:47:29] <teear> What you have there in yeer base tag and why
[17:47:58] <amh345> i said it twice now
[17:48:36] <teear> I don't still understand the tag <base url="something"> is something from the html4 era
[17:48:46] <NaN> I get the data but still get the "invalid label" error, that's weird
[17:49:43] <chilversc> amh345: so I guess this template is located on S3, and uses relative paths, that point to images stored in S3 ?
[17:49:52] <amh345> chilversc: yes
[17:50:03] <chilversc> but the form is on your local server
[17:50:07] <amh345> and it was working fine while the templates were under a local directory
[17:50:33] <amh345> i've been trying to figure out why my form submits (and fails) to s3 everytime i submit.  now i know why.
[17:50:37] <teear> Remove that base tag completely
[17:50:47] <chilversc> amh345: any reason why you can't modify this template?
[17:50:48] <amh345> teear: then nothing will work
[17:51:18] <amh345> chilversc:  well, they can be technically edited. but the paths are dynamic it makes it much simpler defining with base
[17:51:32] <teear> wtf
[17:51:52] <teear> base has nothing to do with your server side stuff
[17:52:05] <amh345> teear:  - 1 for thinking outside of the box
[17:52:26] <teear> ok
[17:52:44] <teear> I will go and hide under my sofa
[17:53:16] <amh345> if i didnt require base tag. why would i be using it?  it's not exactly a well known tag.
[17:54:07] <teear> I thought base was one of those Microsoft tags like marquee
[17:54:08] <amh345> so, can jquery do anything similar like basepath?  or will my results not be the same?
[17:54:46] <amh345> teear:  basepath will prepend a path to an href
[17:54:51] <amh345> or image
[17:55:09] <teear> I know, I am an internet citizen
[17:55:31] <amh345> welll not if you thought it was like marquee
[17:56:08] <teear> I meant I thought it was from Microsoft like Marquee is yee bastars
[17:56:18] <teear> bastard *
[17:56:26] <amh345> *you
[17:56:52] <teear> you you * :---D
[17:57:02] <amh345> heh
[17:57:13] <amh345> carry on, internet citizan
[17:57:18] <amh345> citizen*
[17:57:19] <teear> hah
[17:57:50] <amh345> so $('img').attrib('src', awesome_path);  might do the trick for me.
[17:57:57] <amh345> according to other internet citizens
[17:58:11] <teear> yep just do it with j-queery
[17:58:33] <amh345> Freudian slip?
[17:58:34] <amh345> lol
[17:59:22] <teear> do not be a fairy do it with j-queery :D
[18:00:03] <amh345> if i did ti with jquery, people would stop asking me wtf base is
[18:00:29] <systemfault> Perhaps you should have done it with jQuery instead of using the old shitty <base> tag?
[18:00:30] <systemfault>  ;)
[18:00:51] <systemfault> I've only seen a single good usage of it in my life and it was for tinyMCE plugins..
[18:01:39] <amh345> it's worked fine on my geocities site for all these years. thank you very much
[18:02:00] <amh345> ill probably find out soon why i forgot jquery wouldnt work for this.
[18:02:40] <systemfault> Perhaps you should consider switching from Frontpage 1998 :/
[18:03:54] <systemfault> ?eval "lol".blink()
[18:03:54] <caniuse> systemfault: '<blink>lol</blink>'
[18:04:19] <amh345> see. jquery is doing something goofy!
[18:04:45] <amh345> http://www.path.com/to/my/images/images/1.jpg
[18:04:52] <amh345> wtf image/images?
[18:05:32] <amh345> oh. my @var had images in it.
[18:05:38] * amh345 smokes more meth
[18:06:16] <amh345> well. it looks like jquery did it. i think.  godbless microsoft!
[18:06:31] <systemfault> Hmm… can't wait for the final season of Breaking Bad…
[18:07:53] <systemfault> You've seen the video of Linus Torvald saying fuck you nvidia? :P
[18:08:33] <teear> I'm anal about standards and web development
[18:08:49] <mawhtin> is there a way to download a customized version of jquerymobile like how we would with jquery? I don't need all of jQm's features
[18:09:02] <teear> Maybe that's because I'm from Finland like Linus
[18:09:08] <mawhtin> amh345: what did jquery do?
[18:09:53] <amh345> mawhtin: allowed me to ditch base tag
[18:10:09] <teear> hoho
[18:10:13] <mawhtin> haha
[18:10:36] <amh345> while there are some glitches in my app it caused.  50 extra lines of code will allow me to get past the usage of basetag
[18:20:25] <NaN> so the only way to load a json is with jsonp?
[18:22:00] <systemfault> only way to load json from another domain...
[18:22:06] <systemfault> JSONP is a ugly hack.
[18:22:39] <systemfault> (There's also CORS for loading from another domain but… it's not supported on bad browsers0
[18:32:06] <mansuk> Hi all
[18:32:22] <mansuk> in jquery when I register an event handler, how do I un-register it?
[18:32:48] <danheberden> mansuk: http://api.jquery.com/off
[18:33:05] <danheberden> surprisingly, the opposite of http://api.jquery.com/on
[18:33:36] <mansuk> danheberden: thanks.. does it work irrespective of how we register the event? i mean events registered via bind for example
[18:34:04] <danheberden> well, i'd really recommend using on/off - but yes
[18:35:02] <NaN> systemfault: i'm loading from the same domain and doesn't work, I mean, I get the data, but still getting that ugly "invalid label" error =/
[18:35:37] <mansuk> danheberden: can I replace  live with on? since live can also work on elements that are not yet added to the dom
[18:41:45] <systemfault> Depending on what arguments you pass to .on, it will act like .bind or .live
[19:00:00] <mansuk> systemfault: thanks... is there a way to check if I already bound a handler to this ev.target?
[19:00:33] <mansuk> how do I compare equality of dom elements in JS?
[19:14:25] <mansuk> how do I query the class of an element, the class I added with addClass? Is there a getClass?
[19:14:53] <systemfault> hasClass
[19:19:11] <mansuk> got it hasClass..
[20:03:52] <rakm> how do I select an element passing a variable into a data-attribute? i.e. pass in a variable for 3 in the following: $('*[data-post=3]');
[20:05:35] <rakm> no one's around on a saturday night to answer my jquery question? how sad
[20:05:58] <tw2113> you've also waited a whole 2 minutes
[20:06:32] <rakm> i figured it wasn't a difficult question for the experts in here. pardon my impatience
[20:06:48] <tw2113> you were also right about it being saturday night too :P
[20:07:04] <tw2113> apparently jQuery nerds can manage social lives too
[20:07:46] <rakm> I guess that's not entirely a bad thing :)
[20:10:28] <rakm> this finally worked for me: $("[data-post='" + num + "']");
[20:55:08] <plantian> Hey guys, I'm trying to understand jquery "widgets".  Is it possible to save a reference to an instance of a widget and then operate on that instance to ask it to destroy itself later?  Does that question make sense ?

[21:27:23] <gloomer> whoa
[21:29:58] <raj> anyone wanna talk jq?
[21:30:47] <morficus> no thx - it's too late
[21:32:08] <systemfault> genius.
[21:41:02] <raj> I've got a dialog box that I'm showing with the option {show:'slow'}. But doing this (astoundingly) alters the css, causing a slight shift left and up (thereby hiding the left and top borders). You can see it by click on Change Picture (hover over the image) http://207.237.194.225:8080/asdf
[21:47:24] <gloomer> not seeing anything wrong raj
[21:49:19] <raj> try now gloomer
[21:49:24] <raj> I added show:'slow'
[21:50:44] <gloomer> Internal Server Error
[21:51:06] <zoster> $('selector').show('slow');
[21:51:07] <raj> resolved
[21:54:18] <raj> gloomer, see what I mean?
[21:54:23] <raj> or zoster
[21:55:02] <zoster> not quite
[21:57:04] <raj> notice there's no blue border on the left of the dialog
[21:57:22] <raj> but if you comment out that show:'slow' line, it works fine
[21:59:27] <zoster> raj; no offence, but your UI sucks :D
[21:59:38] <zoster> I'm supposed to click on the
[21:59:41] <zoster> change picture
[21:59:48] <zoster> and check out the link in the opening dialog?
[22:00:29] <gloomer> ya dialog is not resizing correcctly , width: auto
[22:00:30] <gloomer> im sure
[22:00:49] <raj> hmm
[22:00:50] <zoster> why do you use width auto ?
[22:01:14] <zoster> do you want it to appear (fadein)
[22:01:19] <raj> it's not resizing correctly?
[22:01:32] <zoster> or continue using this bad effect
[22:01:33] <zoster> ?
[22:01:38] <raj> width:'auto' makes it adjust to its content
[22:01:50] <raj> i want it to fade in slowly
[22:02:00] <raj> but doing that hides the resize bars for the left and top
[22:02:13] <raj> hence, not being able to resize in those two regions
[22:02:15] <zoster> is it position absolute?
[22:02:28] <raj> is what position absolute?
[22:02:45] <zoster> nevermind..
[22:02:49] <zoster> a css thing
[22:03:03] <zoster> you can use fadeIn, fadeOut effects
[22:03:07] <zoster> toggleFade as well
[22:03:10] <raj> i know what absolute positioning is :) i just meant which element are you referring to
[22:03:13] <zoster> for enhanced displaying
[22:03:27] <zoster> the one who's width auto
[22:03:34] <raj> zoster, but I'm just concerned about why show:'slow' would cause a css issue
[22:03:37] <raj> isn't that weird?
[22:03:50] <raj> yes, dialog's are position:absolute
[22:04:09] <gloomer> raj width: auto with dialog is pretty common css issue
[22:04:14] <gloomer> especially for xbrowser
[22:04:25] <raj> gloomer, but the problem isn't width:auto
[22:04:27] <raj> it's show:slow
[22:05:29] <gloomer> give it an absolute width and show slow
[22:06:21] <raj> there you go
[22:06:24] <raj> issue still exists
[22:06:46] <raj> the issue is show:slow
[22:06:53] <raj> weirdest thing ever
[22:07:04] <zoster> and I still do not know
[22:07:10] <zoster> what's your probelm here!
[22:07:55] <raj> zoster, you don't see anything wrong with the dialog box?
[22:08:21] <zoster> no..
[22:08:24] <zoster> borders around
[22:08:28] <zoster> content within
[22:08:30] <zoster> close box
[22:08:34] <zoster> centered on the screen
[22:08:37] <zoster> what should I see?
[22:10:40] <raj> zoster, it's missing the left border
[22:10:54] <raj> and top border, but you probably can't tell cuz the titlebar div is the same color as the border
[22:11:33] <zoster> all borders around where I'm looking at
[22:11:35] <zoster> in FF 13.1
[22:11:42] <raj> oh, try chrome if you can
[22:14:19] <zoster> remove:
[22:14:33] <zoster> jquery-ui.css line: 228
[22:14:42] <zoster> overflow: hidden; // remove that line or comment it
[22:14:43] <zoster> and try again
[22:15:05] <zoster> see what it will do
[22:17:47] <raj> zoster, that fixes it
[22:17:50] <raj> but it shouldn't need to
[22:17:59] <raj> like why is show:'slow' causing this css issue?
[22:18:58] <zoster> use another modal box
[22:19:01] <zoster> or write your won
[22:19:03] <zoster> own*
[22:21:26] <shoky> the docs specifically state that slow animation of widgets will shift them
[22:24:20] <raj> seriously??
[22:24:48] <shoky> no, just pulling your leg raj ! ! ! ! !
[22:24:55] <raj> haha
[22:24:58] <shoky> ;dZD:zD:ZD:ZdZ:DZ
[22:25:00] <raj> jerk
[22:25:03] <shoky> sori
[22:25:33] * shoky hugs raj
[22:25:54] <raj> ;)
[22:27:15] <raj> i'm seriously astounded that slow animation could screw up css
[22:28:40] <raj> if I remove overflow:hidden; it then adds scrollbars to the page when dragged to the bottom or right
[22:31:53] <raj> so any ideas for a solution?
[22:32:51] <zoster> stop using jquery UI
[22:32:57] <zoster> write your own modal, or use fancybox, etc
[22:33:35] <shoky> raj
[22:33:41] <shoky> where did you get  show: 'slow'  ?
[22:34:13] <zoster> .show('slow') --> maybe
[22:34:39] <raj> shoky, what do you mean?
[22:34:45] <raj> how did I come up with that option?
[22:34:48] <shoky> yes
[22:35:27] <raj> no idea, I think someone told me to do that
[22:35:31] <raj> like a year ago
[22:35:39] <gloomer> ya not in spec
[22:35:44] <gloomer> good catch shoky
[22:36:46] <raj> the guy is always making good catches
[22:37:01] <raj> kinda weird thing if you ask me
[22:37:13] <raj> =P
[22:37:35] <raj> $( ".selector" ).dialog({ show: "slide" });
[22:38:14] <zoster> bad stuff
[22:38:17] <zoster> that jQuery UI
[22:38:24] <zoster> write a custom modal
[22:38:32] <shoky> we heard you, zoster
[22:39:26] <raj> I actually like jqui, and I'm weary about adding an additional library to do something one of my current libs can
[22:39:38] <zoster> well I see.đ
[22:39:40] <zoster> :)
[22:42:25] <shoky> btw raj
[22:43:06] <shoky> you should initialize the dialog only once in your DOM ready handler, with autoOpen: false, and just do .dialog('open') to show it
[22:43:17] <acidjazz>  
[22:43:28] <shoky> or if you want a new one each time, .dialog('destroy') the old one first
[22:54:02] <bindi>         $.datepicker.setDefaults( $.datepicker.regional[ "fi" ] );
[22:54:20] <bindi> I have jquery-ui.datepicker-fi.js in the same folder as the jquery and jquery ui js files
[22:54:27] <bindi> er, jquery.ui.datepicker-fi.js
[22:55:02] <bindi> but it's still in english
[22:56:55] <zoster> include it
[22:57:01] <zoster> in your script tag
[22:57:03] <zoster> <script>
[22:57:08] <bindi> oh.
[22:57:38] <bindi> that's better
[22:58:52] <tw2113> yo shokester mc shoky
[23:08:00] <shoky> yo michael
[23:08:07] <shoky> wazoop
[23:09:36] <tw2113> work procrastination, as awlays
[23:09:38] <tw2113> always*
[23:13:30] <shoky> best kind of procrastination
[23:21:44] <SoulRaven> hello
[23:22:02] <SoulRaven> there is a bug, on ui dialog, with width: auto and minWidth
[23:22:27] <SoulRaven> because when i try to set minWidth is not working, if i have allready set width: auto
[23:37:16] <raj> shoky, thanks, that's a good point
[23:37:36] <SoulRaven> anyone?
[23:43:27] <shoky> SoulRaven: jsfiddle a demonstration of the issue
[23:44:03] <raj> shoky, btw, show:'slow' is allowed cuz you can use any of the animation properties of jquery's show/hide method
[23:45:45] <shoky> raj where does it say that?
[23:46:16] <raj> http://jqueryui.com/demos/dialog/#animated
[23:46:18] <shoky> raj it uses jqueryui effects i think
[23:46:19] <raj> under the example
[23:46:23] <shoky> not jquery's show method
[23:46:39] <raj> "Dialogs may be animated by specifying an effect for the show and/or hide properties. You must include the individual effects file for any effects you would like to use."
[23:46:53] <shoky> yeah, an effect
[23:46:56] <raj> oh
[23:46:58] <raj> right
[23:47:04] <raj> i meant to read that before I pasted it
[23:47:04] <shoky> http://jqueryui.com/demos/show/
[23:47:09] <raj> >_<
[23:47:25] <shoky> ;~P
[23:48:54] <raj> and I need an 'effect file' for each of those?
[23:49:35] <raj> why is there no fadeIn effect either
[23:49:41] <shoky> only if you didnt already include them in your custom jqui download
[23:50:06] <raj> oh, i see
[23:50:29] <raj> but fadeIn is not even possible I see
[23:51:08] <shoky> what if you try  show:'fade'  ?
[23:51:23] <shoky> cause there's a fade here: http://jqueryui.com/demos/effect/
[23:51:26] <shoky> dunno
[23:52:17] <raj> brilliant
[23:52:18] <raj> it works
[23:52:58] <shoky> ;D
[23:53:04] <raj> thank you :)
[23:53:12] <shoky> np bra
[23:53:27] <shoky> i like 'bounce'
