[00:01:56] <Back2Basics> systemfault: working version http://jsfiddle.net/y7gQc/2/  (I can't do anything with the data yet but I know it's sending properly now.)
[00:02:22] <systemfault> :D
[00:02:24] <systemfault> NICE
[00:02:36] <Back2Basics> it's got the structure!
[00:02:47] <Back2Basics> it's got the ajax
[00:02:58] <Back2Basics> it doesn't have the preventsend thingy.
[00:03:29] <systemfault> Just add it?
[00:04:09] <systemfault> Perhaps your validate plugin does it… I never used it
[00:08:08] <Carlitta87> i have a small question... how can i make my background slider only use half of the page and not the whole?
[00:09:56] <overburn> hey guys, quick question - how on earth do i use jquery ui autocomplete with a remote datasource? i'm trying exactly the examples on the jquery website and it accesses the source url, but doesn't show any results
[00:09:58] <overburn> any ideas?
[00:10:48] <OffN> are U sure your serving is answering anything on the source?
[00:10:57] <OffN> your server*
[00:11:05] <overburn> OffN - yes
[00:11:35] <overburn> the request is being made, and when i access the url , the correct results are shown json encoded but the autocomplete doesn't show
[00:12:31] <OffN> and are U sure when you are typing requests are made?
[00:12:40] <OffN> i personnaly use firebug to see it
[00:12:56] <OffN> each char i type i see the request and the json answer :)
[00:13:01] <overburn> yeah
[00:13:13] <overburn> i used firebug for that
[00:13:18] <OffN> oh ok
[00:13:33] <overburn> everything seems to be ok , the request is being made, just not autocomplete is shown
[00:13:36] <overburn> and it's driving me nuts
[00:13:57] <systemfault> You used the example on the website?
[00:14:07] <Carlitta87>  i have a small question... how can i make my background slider only use half of the page and not the whole?
[00:14:47] <overburn> systemfault - yes
[00:14:57] <OffN> overburn: when U have your answers, are you sure its added to the ul HTML list?
[00:15:12] <OffN> you can verify it also with firebug, its highligtned
[00:15:33] <overburn> hmm
[00:15:35] <overburn>  checking now
[00:17:36] <OffN> if its added, it should be a css problem(mayby jquery.ui css is overrided or not imported at all), if its not, there is a problem with the code you copy ;)
[00:18:35] <overburn> yeap... found the problem
[00:18:39] <overburn> everything was opk
[00:18:39] <overburn> ok
[00:18:50] <OffN> :p
[00:19:15] <overburn> the server however, besides the json string , was outputting some script blocks from another previous include that i had forgot about
[00:19:23] <overburn> and as i didn't bother to check the source.. heh
[00:19:32] <OffN> ^^
[00:23:11] <Back2Basics> systemfault: Yes.  I found that the validate pluggin does when you put it in the    "submitHandler: function (form) {" section
[00:27:00] <johnny5151> hi
[00:27:12] <johnny5151> is there a selctor
[00:27:25] <johnny5151> to find attribute name widlcards?
[00:27:56] <johnny5151> i have 2 data attributes data-view-1 and data-view-2
[00:28:04] <johnny5151> any selector to get these?
[00:28:32] <johnny5151> by using a wildcard for the number part?
[00:33:05] <OffN> use a class on both of these ;)
[00:33:13] <OffN> and use the class as a selector :p
[00:39:18] <johnny5151> yeah was thinking that
[00:39:25] <johnny5151> no other choice huh
[00:39:29] <johnny5151> :)
[00:39:29] <johnny5151> thnx
[00:43:05] <wodemay> is there a way for me to change the type of an element while keeping all its attributes?
[00:43:12] <wodemay> like i wanna turn an <input> into an <a>?
[00:44:00] <Mohsen_Hassani> I need to get the height size of the client browser/screen.
[00:47:46] <zulu-gula> does jqueery animation relays on volume of html code?
[00:48:06] <javalover> hey guys how do you add just on mousescroll in general?
[00:48:21] <javalover> like when this screen is up I want it to be any scrolling at all during this moment // do stuff
[00:48:40] <c0kemachine> if I have a <h1> on a page and I have: $(document).ready(function() { var h1Value = $("h1").val(); alert(h1Value); }); - Is there any reason why the alert would be blank ?
[00:49:07] <javalover> sure, ur not using #h1 maybe?
[00:49:14] <kollapse> Nope
[00:49:31] <javalover> umm could be h1 has nothing in it?
[00:49:51] <kollapse> c0kemachine: Headers don't really have values.
[00:50:01] <javalover> could be that 2 i'm an amature jquery developer
[00:50:02] <kollapse> c0kemachine: Are you trying to retrieve the contents of the element ?
[00:50:06] <c0kemachine> yes
[00:50:16] <kollapse> c0kemachine: .html() or .text()
[00:50:22] <kollapse> .val() is only for inputs, selects etc.
[00:53:15] <c0kemachine> thanks
[00:53:21] <javalover> nobody wants to answer my question? how do I do document.onscroll?
[00:54:45] <kollapse> javalover: Probably because the answer can already be easily found on Google.
[00:55:45] <javalover> lol fineeee but my question is how to do I refer to the actual document
[01:07:43] <zulu-gula> how to hold click even on pagination button to animation ends?
[01:13:26] <Haprog> zulu-gula: you make no sense
[01:15:51] <zulu-gula> Haprog:  I mean: I have pager animation and I want to wait till one animation ends before another can be run. Becouse now if I click during animation all is misspositioned
[01:16:50] <zulu-gula> Haprog:  becouse pager base on current position.left
[01:17:48] <Haprog> aren't animations on the same element normally queued?
[01:18:03] <Haprog> so they run one after the other and not at the same time.
[01:18:50] <Haprog> or if you don't want to queue animations you need to check that the element isn't currently animating before adding another animation.
[01:19:12] <Haprog> I haven't done much with animations though, someone else may know better.
[01:19:24] <zulu-gula> that would be ok for me
[01:19:26] <zulu-gula> thank you
[01:23:44] <Whirl3d> zulu-gula, so you want to hold down a fwd btn and have it cylcle through pages?
[01:24:52] <zulu-gula> no, I want to click button, then animate page. and during animation if click button again nothing should happend. if click button after animation ends, it animates page again
[01:25:58] <Whirl3d> $("pagebutton").click(function (e) {if ($("containter").is(":animated")) {return false; //do page change
[01:27:23] <Whirl3d> of course you have to put your pagebutton and container classes in the formula above, bu tthat's the basic idea.
[01:46:28] <poppiez> what do you guys think the best easing is for slideshows?
[01:46:52] <Whirl3d> I like easeOutBack for entrance, and easeInOutBack for exit
[01:47:42] <owen1> i want to chunk my jquery file into multiple files, for maintainability purposes. will i ended up having document.ready in each file?
[01:48:00] <Whirl3d> probably
[01:48:16] <Whirl3d> but not necessarily
[01:48:27] <Whirl3d> you could have one script that called the
[01:48:34] <Whirl3d> init functions from the others
[01:49:07] <owen1> Whirl3d: that sounds great. any code sample that shows that?
[01:49:26] <poppiez> Whirl3d: thx :)
[01:50:02] <Whirl3d> poppiez, if you do use those and you are animating over long distances or long times, make sure to adjust the multiplier in your ease formula. YOu'll have to play with it
[01:50:39] <Whirl3d> owen1, sorry I do not have such a reference as that is really a specific implementation issue...
[01:51:00] <poppiez> Whirl3d: noted. playing with it now :)
[01:51:06] <owen1> Whirl3d: thanks
[01:51:13] <Whirl3d> np
[01:51:37] <wodemay> can anyone tell me why this doesn't work? http://jsfiddle.net/nameofjsfact/bkULK/
[01:51:56] <wodemay> It's meant to replace the <input>s with <a>s, and add another <a> whiich appends the string "show/light/" to its href.
[01:52:03] <owen1> Whirl3d: i also want to start using the module pattern, but not sure how to use it with jquery
[01:55:33] <Whirl3d> owen1, you should probably look at jquery UI and the widget factory for some insight.
[02:14:20] <owen1> Whirl3d: will do
[02:15:47] <poppiez> hi, I'm animating two images next to each other inside an inner div from right to left. while this works, some browsers make the right image flicker as if they only try to render the image when it's in the viewport and not outside of the window. any way to "prerender" the images?
[02:19:03] <Whirl3d> you might want to consider using the transitions plugin for jquery. It replaces animate with html5/css3 aniamtions wherever it can...often resulting in smoother animations.
[02:39:16] <molavy> hi
[02:39:32] <molavy> why this code don't work
[02:39:37] <molavy> http://dpaste.com/754148/
[02:40:55] <molavy> this don't return body on firefox but return status 200, and on opera i that return response body but alert don't work
[02:45:21] <molavy> any idea?
[02:48:30] <molavy> OK, i found solution,i replace success with complete on js code
[02:50:03] <molavy> but , that return status 200 in red color on firebug
[02:54:53] <johnline> hey peopie, is there a way of asking if something has an id? like if ($('body').hasid('poopie')
[03:08:04] <vjt> johnline: $('[id]')
[03:08:04] <vjt> johnline: if you're looking for all A elements with an id you can use $('a[id]')
[03:08:04] <vjt> johnline: or if you're looking for all elements within a #container having an id you can use $('#container [id]')
[03:08:04] <vjt> johnline: http://api.jquery.com/has-attribute-selector/ :-)
[03:12:14] <vjt> johnline: I misinterpreted your question - sorry - the correct answer is if ($('body').attr('id'))
[03:21:29] <johnline> thanks vjt
[03:21:48] <johnline> if ($('body').attr('#profile'))
[03:21:59] <johnline> is it correct to use the # ?
[03:22:02] <vjt> johnline: nope :-)
[03:22:23] <vjt> johnline: if you have <body profile="foo"> you'd use if ($('body').attr('profile'))
[03:22:41] <vjt> johnline: and .attr() will return you the "profile" attribute value
[03:23:03] <vjt> johnline: anyway, I'd suggest you to prefix your non-standard attribute with "data-"
[03:23:21] <johnline> oh i see thats why its not working lol
[03:23:30] <vjt> johnline: to follow the HTML5 standard
[03:23:46] <vjt> johnline: and with jQuery you'll be able to use .data('profile') to get that value
[03:24:04] <vjt> johnline: <body data-profile="foo"> $('body').data('profile') yields "foo"
[03:24:19] <vjt> johnline: if data-profile is defined, "undefined" otherwise :-)
[03:33:07] <johnline> if ($('body').attr('id') == 'profile') {
[03:33:18] <johnline> using this so far
[03:36:06] <johnline> oooh giiirl
[03:36:29] <johnline> just realised my page wasnt reading the right main.js i've been editing
[03:36:40] <johnline> works fine thanks again vjt
[03:37:28] <sviatovigt> can someone please help me with this: http://jsfiddle.net/vQtWD/6/ ?
[03:37:30] <sviatovigt> thank you
[03:44:02] <risky_s> how do you make a full screen css gradient background?
[03:45:14] <Haprog> just do a normal css gradient background? there's nothing special about fullscreen. just apply it to body or other element that fills the whole body.
[03:46:16] <Haprog> or do you actually want fullscreen without the browser window chrome etc? then you just need to change the page to fullscreen mode somehow
[03:48:15] <risky_s> na with the browser window is fine, however I am using the ultimate css gradient generator, however when I apply it to the body, it doesnt looks like the same i have generated
[03:49:31] <Haprog> I don't know then
[03:53:05] <sviatovigt> any ideas with this: http://jsfiddle.net/vQtWD/6/

[04:02:31] <Nece228> hello
[04:02:34] <Nece228> so i was wondering
[04:02:39] <Nece228> lets say
[04:02:52] <Nece228> im executing the script in products.php

[04:05:55] <Gozzy> Nece228 sure you can send back whatever you want from products.php depending what kind of variables you send to it eg products.php gives back a product page and products.php?id=1 gives back a product details
[04:06:58] <Nece228> Gozzy: oh thanks for informatino

[04:18:45] <Antonis> Hello. I have a question about jquery mobile.. I want to create a navigation bar with 20 buttons. Is it possible to make 4 lines with 5 buttons in each line? Cause when I add more than five buttons I get two buttons in each line.. I solved the problem by creating 4 different navigation bars but I don't like this solution
[04:31:37] <Antonis> anyone?
[04:36:30] <Vainoharhainen> Hmm http://jsfiddle.net/jWkd9/ test to press on plus on row1 then plus on row2 (fast).
[04:36:33] <Vainoharhainen> I get alert on same id
[04:37:07] <Vainoharhainen> No idea why its doing that. hrmm
[04:39:36] <Kingsy> if I do something like this jQuery.get(skuref, function(data){ }  where var skuref = "../somepath/to/somewhere/"; and in some instances that path does not exist. you get an error (network error 404 not found) is there a way to stop this error showing? see you don't know that the path is empty till you attempt a .get() .. any suggestions welcome
[04:46:56] <Vainoharhainen> solved it.

[04:49:38] <Zed7> hey, can anyone here help me with saving a variable to an xml file?
[04:50:11] <Antonis> Hello. I have a question about jquery mobile.. I want to create a navigation bar with 20 buttons. Is it possible to make 4 lines with 5 buttons in each line? Cause when I add more than five buttons I get two buttons in each line.. I solved the problem by creating 4 different navigation bars but I don't like this solution
[04:50:43] <pachet> yannickoo: use bracket notation
[04:50:50] <yannickoo> pachet: hm?
[04:50:57] <pachet> ?eval var a = {}; a[0]='foo'; a
[04:51:00] <bot-t> pachet: {"0": "foo"}
[04:51:22] <yannickoo> ah!
[04:55:18] <Antonis> anyone?
[04:57:59] <owen1> https://gist.github.com/2851571   is promises more readable? i don't understand who they work ):
[04:58:47] <owen1> who=how
[04:59:43] <pachet> i think they're pretty readable
[04:59:50] <pachet> and theres lots of material out there on how they work
[04:59:52] <pachet> ?promises

[05:05:39] <Antonis> does anyone know if what I asked is possible or not?
[05:07:06] <owen1> pachet: var menuFilePromise = mainWindow.menu("File");      why is .menu returning a promise?
[05:11:26] <Carlitta87>  i have a small question... how can i make my background slider only use half of the page and not the whole?
[05:17:02] <Kingsy> if I do something like this jQuery.get(skuref, function(data){ }  where var skuref = "../somepath/to/somewhere/"; and in some instances that path does not exist. you get an error (network error 404 not found) is there a way to stop this error showing? see you don't know that the path is empty till you attempt a .get() .. any suggestions welcome
[05:18:45] <Cork> Kingsy: as long as the server actually returns an http 404 it shouldn't be inserted
[05:19:23] <Cork> the callback happens on success, so any status errors should not execute it
[05:19:27] <Kingsy> Cork: noehting is inserted as such.. but the console has a 404 net work error in it.. it just seems wrong having that there
[05:19:43] <Cork> ya, no thats expected
[05:19:48] <Cork> and it SHOULD show
[05:19:57] <Kingsy> really?
[05:19:59] <Cork> its the monitor of the network sockets
[05:20:05] <Kingsy> seems "funny" heh
[05:20:13] <Cork> and as the network sockets get http 404 it should show
[05:21:00] <Kingsy> is there any way you can hide it? for example..  there is an instance on my site I could end up with 30 of them.. and I donj't like that
[05:23:28] <Kingsy> Cork: do you know what I mean? its just a bit of a pain having so many 404's there as a check.. for example.. isnt there a way to CHECK if the path exists and if it does commit to the get () ?
[05:23:54] <pachet> no
[05:23:57] <pachet> .get is the check
[05:24:09] <pachet> theres no real way to check if a remote resource exists shy of making an actual request
[05:24:30] <pachet> i guess you could come up with something clever where you only execute one POST to a url you know is designated to return information about available paths
[05:24:44] <pachet> then the ones that are actually existant are returned in the post response, and you act on those
[05:24:50] <Kingsy> pachet: I know.. I just don't like the fact that it throws the 404 back.. I understand its useful information but 30 of them piled up in there is a pain
[05:42:35] <Cork> Kingsy: the 404 in the console happens even if you reference it in a <img src="none existing url">
[05:42:53] <Cork> Kingsy: its from when the browser checks if the url exists
[05:43:17] <Cork> you can filter network trafics from your console if you like
[05:43:32] <Kingsy> its no big deal I guess
[05:58:33] <lugzer> hi
[06:01:36] <zulu-gula> why this does not work? $('ul li a').live('click', function(){ alert('voilla!');}); ? element "a" is generated dynamically. More than one lement "a". jQuery v1.3.2
[06:04:03] <hrwath> zulu-gula, do you have any href's in those as?
[06:04:03] <Jon47> zulu-gula: make a fiddle?
[06:05:07] <zulu-gula> hrwath:  created link is like: <a class="page-2" href="#page-2">2</a>
[06:05:47] <zulu-gula> Jon47:  don't know what it is, sorry
[06:06:13] <Jon47> jsfiddle.net - create a reduction of the issue that we can all look at to help us debug it for you
[06:06:31] <zulu-gula> ok
[06:07:57] <hrwath> zulu-gula, works for me: http://jsfiddle.net/SXfH8/ check your jquery code - do you have proper selectors?
[06:08:51] <DaveJ|UK> Anyone got any experience with the BeautyTips plugin? I am trying to use closeWhenOthersOpen but it has no effect
[06:11:30] <GoGoGarrett> Are there any jQuery plugin's that mimic the Finder like file browser?  I can't seem to find any good ones
[06:14:27] <risky> quick question, when using headers on a page <h1> <h2> ... what if you dont have a main header, but a bunch of h2's is it okay to omit the h1 tage#
[06:14:31] <risky> tag*?
[06:15:09] <zulu-gula> hrwath: weird, if selector was $('.class1 .class2 a') it did not work, but if it was just $('.class2 a') it was ok
[06:16:13] <hrwath> zulu-gula, .class1 .class2 a means you're looking for <a>s which parent is .class2 which parent is .class1
[06:16:29] <zulu-gula> hrwath:  yes I know
[06:16:40] <hrwath> zulu-gula, you meant $('.class1 a, .class2 a')
[06:16:56] <zulu-gula> hrwath: no, .class1 .class2 a
[06:17:04] <zulu-gula> a in class2, class2 in class1
[06:17:30] <zulu-gula> nvm, it works now thank you
[06:17:36] <hrwath> okay :)
[06:20:08] <zulu-gula> I'm wondering how to find current active link class, code is here: http://jsfiddle.net/LhEbC/
[06:21:02] <zulu-gula> is it possible with some procedure? Or I need to get attr('class') and parse string?
[06:21:28] <pachet> zulu-gula: you mean, whether its 'link-1' or 'link-2'?
[06:21:35] <zulu-gula> yes
[06:21:48] <Jon47> GoGoGarrett: do you want it to actually access the filesystem or just use an object or dom fragment to build a UI that *looks* like a filesystem?
[06:22:19] <GoGoGarrett> just build the ui to make it look like one, I'm doing all of the storage and stuff myself
[06:22:29] <pachet> zulu-gula: well, if this is just a test case, and in reality you're going to have a lot more possible classes, then yeah, you're going to have to parse it
[06:22:48] <GoGoGarrett> I want to do ajax calls to the actions to retrieve the images though
[06:22:48] <pachet> otherwise, if you're only going to have two, then a simple .hasClass('link-1') would have my vote

[06:42:33] <johnline> does fadeOut affect display:none or opacity:0 ?
[06:42:53] <danheberden> both
[06:43:06] <pachet> it animates the opacity
[06:43:07] <danheberden> once opacity reaches 0, it's set to display:none
[06:43:12] <pachet> then sets the --yeah
[06:43:14] <Whirl3d> but it has been my experience that it has problems.
[06:43:16] <pachet> faster typist ^
[06:43:29] <danheberden> it also had a bad childhood
[06:43:34] <danheberden> so be gentle with it
[06:43:42] <danheberden> fadeIn is quite abusive you see
[06:44:07] <johnline> hmm yeah
[06:44:24] <mekwall> gnarf, yeah it's awesome!
[06:44:29] <johnline> it would be desirable for me sometimes to set opacity but not display:none some stuff
[06:45:35] <fouad_> hello
[06:46:04] <Whirl3d> johnline, use .animate
[06:46:07] <danmichel> can't seem to get cufon working on my site NSFW: http://varmag.com/ . as you can see from the screenshot, all the files have been uploaded and i put it in my functions.php http://d.pr/i/9cjt
[06:46:09] <danmichel> any help would be greatly appreciated. thanks
[06:46:24] <fouad_> im using $('.class').append("<option value='"+i+"'></option>"); inside of a loop
[06:46:34] <fouad_> and it's added to the DOM
[06:47:34] <Whirl3d>  congrats fouad_, did you have a question?
[06:47:58] <fouad_> but when i click on the <select> box, all of the options are empty
[06:48:57] <fouad_> Whirl3d, yeah ^
[06:49:41] <Whirl3d> If you wanted to create a fiddle at jsfiddle.com, it would be a lot easier to help you troubleshoot
[06:49:52] <fouad_> Whirl3d, alright ill go ahead and do that
[06:50:27] <Whirl3d> Usually, just the process of setting up a fiddle exposes the underlying issue. Paste the url here and we can from there
[06:52:17] <fouad_> Whirl3d, http://jsfiddle.net/Hy4XY/
[06:53:36] <Whirl3d> you have nothing in the option text
[06:53:50] <Whirl3d> <option value='1'></option> will appear blank
[06:54:10] <Whirl3d> whereas <option value='1'>1</option> is what I guess you are looking for
[06:54:41] <fouad_> oiccccc
[06:54:56] <fouad_> haha thank you :)
[06:55:24] <Whirl3d> np. hey you might want to check if that option exists before appending it
[06:55:46] <plbyrd> Is there a document event that fires before .ready?
[06:55:58] <plbyrd> I need to inject a class before .ready fires.
[06:56:23] <Whirl3d> if ($(".regionTroops").find("option[value='"+i+"']).length return; //append it since it doesn't exist
[06:57:31] <Whirl3d> plbyrd, placing your js inline (after the content into which you wish to inject the class) should fire before .ready
[07:02:23] <techknowlust> I'm writing a small bookmarklet and I'm trying to monitor mouseover events accross all elements on the page.
[07:02:44] <techknowlust> is $("*").mouseover(... function ...) the most efficient way of doing this?
[07:03:07] <techknowlust> I see that the jquery docs say that $("*") is quite slow.
[07:03:35] <danheberden> why would you want to create an event handler on every element?
[07:03:50] <danheberden> that's like instead of putting a microphone in the room, you want one on every person
[07:04:33] <danheberden> techknowlust are you familiar with event bubbling and delegation?
[07:04:36] <techknowlust> I want the user to be able to single out elements. the mouseover would add a small highlight class
[07:04:49] <techknowlust> danheberden: nope I'm quite new to jQuery and its workings
[07:08:13] <danheberden> techknowlust http://jqfundamentals.com/#chapter-5
[07:09:01] <danheberden> basically, you can listen on the parent  - when teh mouseover event happens, it 'bubbles up' the dom tree - thus, for example, a click event on a link will fire on the link, it's parent, and ultimately, document
[07:09:03] <techknowlust> danheberden: thanks. this was exactly what I was looking for. I just didn't know what it was called
[07:09:19] <danheberden> and when you get that event, you get the element that fired it
[07:09:38] <techknowlust> and I figured there had to be a better way than $("*")
[07:09:42] <techknowlust> thanks :)
[07:09:59] <danheberden> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event.target
[07:10:05] <danheberden> oh totes
[07:10:24] <danheberden> and the documentation for see ?on should cover some of that too
[07:10:24] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:15:34] <plbyrd> Is there a document level event that fires AFTER ready?
[07:16:06] <danheberden> plbyrd .ready( function(){ /* stuff i want to do on ready */ /* stuff i want to do afterward */ }); ?
[07:16:12] <johnkpaul> plbyrd: "document level"?
[07:16:22] <johnkpaul> perhaps $(window).load?
[07:22:51] <danieldeusing> hey
[07:22:55] <danieldeusing> http://pastebin.com/0hEFr53p
[07:23:19] <danieldeusing> somebody knows how to open the DOM window within dynamically created links ?
[07:23:39] <suttons> Hello everyone
[07:24:03] <suttons> Before I go back to software support I was wondering if you guys may be able to point out what's happening for me first.
[07:24:07] <danieldeusing> my hardcoded link at line 109 works fine, but the dynamic link on line 45 not
[07:24:52] <suttons> I've got an ecommerce site and a product listing page with some select fields for the usual things like sort by a-z, show in and out of stock and another one for choosing the first letter of the product
[07:24:58] <danheberden> danieldeusing this code.. needs some serious attention
[07:25:18] <danieldeusing> tell me danheberden
[07:25:32] <suttons> I've been very happuy with the additional UI enhancments - utilising 'title' attributes to provide additional hover over info. etc but I have found an issue.,
[07:26:12] <suttons> When you choose if you want to display all items, only IN STOCK, or only OUT OS STOCK, it works,, then it just reloads the page and resets the data choice
[07:26:39] <coldhead> looks okay to me, danheberden
[07:26:45] <danheberden> danieldeusing things like using jQuery, but having `document.getElementById('whateveritis').innerHTML = ""` instead of $('#whateveritis').empty()
[07:26:46] <suttons> So I really don't know if it's my lack of knowledge OR if it's the software suppliers code doing something.
[07:26:47] <coldhead> it's using HTML5
[07:26:51] <danheberden> coldhead lols
[07:27:22] <suttons> Here's one example of an amend.
[07:27:23] <suttons> $("#ctl00_cph1_pf_pfi0_filter option:eq(1)").replaceWith("<option value='6 0'>Show IN STOCK</option>");
[07:27:29] <danheberden> also, danieldeusing i think if you start working at better consistency in your code style, you'll have an easier time working through stuff
[07:27:38] <suttons> and here's another example of a UI tweak.
[07:27:39] <suttons> $("#ctl00_cph1_ps_sort option:eq(2)").attr("title", "Display your products by lowest price first.");
[07:28:09] <danheberden> danieldeusing https://github.com/rwldrn/idiomatic.js/
[07:28:10] <suttons> Could somebody please take a few mins to mull this over with me? I'd be very greatful
[07:29:25] <suttons> http://jsbin.com/iqibud/4/edit#preview
[07:30:56] <danieldeusing> okay danheberden
[07:31:02] <danieldeusing> but considering my question
[07:31:07] <garbagegod> Let's say I need a ton of click functions
[07:31:12] <danieldeusing> you have some hints ?
[07:31:15] <garbagegod> is there a better way than just having a ton of click functions?
[07:31:47] <garbagegod> like I have a couple hundred divs named ex1 ex2 etc. and I need every one of them to have the same click function
[07:32:25] <truk77> garbagegod, you can assign the same function to more than one object's event
[07:32:34] <garbagegod> truk77: with a class instead?
[07:32:47] <danheberden> garbagegod i would use event delegation
[07:32:52] <truk77> $(selector_that_finds_all_my_divs).click(my_function)
[07:32:52] <danheberden> instead of binding events to each element
[07:33:07] <garbagegod> Well the thing is I need something like $('#ex1').click(function() { $('#exc1').lightbox_me(); });
[07:33:12] <danheberden> http://jqfundamentals.com/#chapter-5
[07:33:22] <danheberden> garbagegod that's how it works, yo
[07:33:56] <garbagegod> Cool I'll read up on it
[07:33:57] <danheberden> $( '#parentContainer' ).on( 'click', function( event ){ var $element = $( event.target ); /* this will be whatever elmeent dispatched the event */ });
[07:33:57] <garbagegod> Thanks
[07:34:47] <truk77> Oh hey, stupid question... $element.click() preferred over $element.on("click", )  Or vice versa?
[07:34:48] <danheberden> ?on
[07:34:49] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:34:55] <danheberden> read up on that too,
[07:35:10] <danheberden> truk77 the new .on syntax is preferable
[07:35:20] <danheberden> it's one method and reads better
[07:35:47] <rroelofs> danheberden:  & garbagegod   woudn't $("#parent").on("click", "[id^="ex"]", function() ...) work better?
[07:35:51] <truk77> Ah, cool, thanks danheberden. Had been working in code that, for some reason, was utilizing jquery 1.5.
[07:36:09] <danheberden> rroelofs it might be easier to use :p
[07:36:23] <rroelofs> true
[07:36:38] <danheberden> i normally use that when it's like element specific
[07:36:47] <rroelofs> I'm kind of old school, so I'm trying to get used to the new way
[07:36:51] <danheberden> like $( document ).on( 'click', 'a', function...
[07:37:00] <danheberden> because that work of filtering is pretty minimal
[07:37:13] <danheberden> past that, i like to get the event target myself and figure out what i need to do
[07:37:43] <danheberden> in the end, though, as long as you are taking advantage of event delegation, you win
[07:37:53] <danheberden> BECAUSE IF YOU DIE IN THE GAME, YOU DIE IN REAL LIFE
[07:40:59] <plbyrd> How do you determine if an element has a class with jquery?
[07:41:05] <plbyrd> I don't mean with a selector.
[07:41:25] <johnkpaul> ?hasClass @ plbyrd
[07:41:44] <johnkpaul> but bot-t, you're here!
[07:41:46] <johnkpaul> plbyrd: http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[07:41:48] <danheberden> also, .is
[07:44:57] <kryl> hi, how to check if an element exist or not ? does $('element').length == 0; is a good test ?
[07:45:17] <kryl> or if ($(selector).length ) { ... }
[07:45:50] <johnkpaul> kryl: both work fine, depends on convention which one you chose
[07:46:04] <kryl> I don't use convention :)
[07:46:33] <kryl> I try to check if element exit (it's dynamic html) and I'll have to bind this with click functions.
[07:46:40] <kryl> but not sure about the way I do that
[07:46:56] <johnkpaul> kryl: you don't _have_ to check if it exists to use .click
[07:47:18] <plbyrd> thanks johnkpaul!
[07:47:29] <johnkpaul> np, plbyrd
[07:48:45] <kryl> johnkpaul, I know.
[07:49:26] <garbagegod> danheberden: so wait, I'm confused, how do I specify the id for the click function if they're all different?
[07:49:41] <danheberden> you specify on the parent of those elements
[07:49:50] <danheberden> and listen to for the events that "bubble up"
[07:49:56] <garbagegod> $('#parent').on('click etc
[07:49:58] <garbagegod> Oh
[07:50:10] <garbagegod> I see
[07:50:19] <danheberden> like $( document ).on('click', function(e){ /* i now get every click on the page for every element */ });
[07:50:39] <garbagegod> I see
[07:50:51] <garbagegod> but the div would have a ton of crap inside of it
[07:50:58] <garbagegod> how would it differentiate
[07:51:17] <garbagegod> between clicking on the things i want to trigger something and all the other stuff in the parent
[07:51:41] <danheberden> you can specify something that's constant, like - if that div has class that's a good identifier
[07:51:47] <danheberden> say every div is class .row
[07:52:06] <danheberden> you could do it yourself, or $( '#parentContainer' ).on( 'click', 'div.row', fn )
[07:52:06] <garbagegod> Oh, so I should just put all the click activators inside a div with a class?
[07:52:11] <garbagegod> Fuck, I'm way too sleepy for this
[07:52:41] <danheberden> When i do it manually, i first check if the event.target IS that element i'm hoping for
[07:53:05] <danheberden> if not, i do $( event.target ).closest( 'div.row' ) or whatever it is i want as that constant/consistant element
[07:53:17] <garbagegod> <div class="pa"><span id="what_I_Want_to_activate_the_button">Activate thing</span></div>
[07:53:17] <garbagegod> $('.pa').on('click', function....
[07:53:28] <garbagegod> like that?
[07:53:35] <danheberden> how many .pa's?
[07:53:43] <garbagegod> maybe a hundred or two
[07:53:55] <danheberden> and what does the button do?
[07:54:04] <garbagegod> Activate a lightbox
[07:54:11] <danheberden> or, rather, is its action relative to content in the .pa
[07:54:17] <garbagegod> nothing to do with pa
[07:54:33] <garbagegod> but for every "pa" there's a hidden "pac"
[07:54:45] <danheberden> that's pretty related to pa :p
[07:54:52] <danheberden> i mean that as, like
[07:54:52] <garbagegod> and clicking on paX just does $('#paX').lightbox_me();
[07:55:10] <garbagegod> oops
[07:55:14] <danheberden> if you add your click handler to the parent of all of those .pa's
[07:55:20] <danheberden> you'll get every click, ya?
[07:55:20] <garbagegod> $('#pacX').lightbox_me();
[07:55:28] <garbagegod> well, uh
[07:55:34] <garbagegod> I guess so?
[07:55:39] <garbagegod> it has a parent
[07:55:51] <danheberden> so you get some click event that may or may not be what you want, but you're now getting them all
[07:55:53] <garbagegod> but the parent has several hundred irrelevant lines of code in it besides the pa
[07:56:01] <garbagegod> i dont see how to specify pa
[07:56:02] <danheberden> yeah, so you need to differentiate
[07:56:14] <danheberden> so you want this to work only when clicking that span then, ya?
[07:56:20] <garbagegod> yessir
[07:56:53] <danheberden> so can that span have a class to specify it's type?
[07:57:03] <danheberden> like span.iMakeLightboxesBitches
[07:57:31] <kryl> I import html with impromptu modal (http://trentrichardson.com/Impromptu/) $.prompt ... and I want to bind click method on this html. but it doesnt work !
[07:57:32] <danheberden> that way, you can filter those click events for the kind of element you want
[07:57:33] <garbagegod> Well yeah
[07:57:44] <garbagegod> but I still need to retain the spans unique ID
[07:58:09] <garbagegod> because #pa42 needs to activate #pac42 and etc
[07:58:33] <danheberden> $( '#whateverParentofPas' ).on( 'click', 'span.iMakeLightboxes', function( e ) { /* this.id is the id of that span */ });
[07:58:40] <danheberden> i would work to not use id's like that
[07:58:47] <danheberden> but you'll figure that out the more you play with it
[07:58:54] <danheberden> baby steps :)
[08:00:38] <garbagegod> Ehh
[08:00:42] <garbagegod> how else would I do it??
[08:00:53] <garbagegod> hang on lemmie try it
[08:00:55] <garbagegod> thanks so much man
[08:02:26] <antihero> Howdy, I'm using JQuery GoogleMaps, I was wondering how to delete a marker
[08:02:32] <antihero> or even just clear all marker
[08:04:01] <antihero> the API documentation seems...sparse
[08:04:18] <garbagegod> in the code you gave me this.id returns the id of the parent, not the id of the span
[08:04:43] <garbagegod> er, $('parentid').on is not a function
[08:04:52] <garbagegod> do I need to use a newer version of jquery or something?
[08:04:56] <danheberden> for on, ya
[08:05:05] <danheberden> 1.7
[08:06:20] <skylamer`> garbagegod
[08:06:32] <skylamer`> "#<the name here>" if its id
[08:06:37] <danheberden> you can do it with older versions.. .bind('click', function(e){ var $elem = $(e.target); if ( $elem.is( '.iMakeLightboxes' ) ) { /* do whatever */ });
[08:07:02] <danheberden> missed a closing brace, you get the idea though
[08:07:56] <garbagegod> I'll just get a newer version of jquery...
[08:08:03] <garbagegod> jquery seems to change a ton from version to version
[08:08:47] <suedoh> hi, i have many anchor links with a certain id, but when i do a $('#idName').each(), it only selects one of them
[08:08:51] <suedoh> any idea on how to bind on all of them?
[08:08:55] <danheberden> garbagegod we add new cool shit
[08:11:26] <skylamer`> which is good
[08:11:41] <johnkpaul> suedoh: an id can only be used once per page, the element needs to be unique
[08:12:00] <suedoh> what is the best procedure to select all elements?
[08:12:23] <jawhn> could anyone here explain why this week picker modification for datePicker will work with a div, but not an input box? http://jsfiddle.net/manishma/AVZJh/
[08:12:33] <garbagegod>                 $( '#ctable' ).on( 'click', 'span.iml', function( e ) { // nothing I put here does anything.... });
[08:12:39] <garbagegod> All the html is in place
[08:12:50] <johnkpaul> suedoh: if you wante very element, you can use *
[08:12:54] <garbagegod> like $(this.id).hide();
[08:13:28] <suedoh> johnkpaul, even if they have non-unique id's?
[08:13:54] <johnkpaul> suedoh: try it and see
[08:13:56] <NoiseEee> garbagegod: you mean this.hide() ?
[08:14:09] <suedoh> johnkpaul, so like #srvClick * ?
[08:14:17] <johnkpaul> suedoh: no, $("*
[08:14:21] <johnkpaul> $("*")
[08:14:32] <garbagegod> nvm
[08:14:38] <garbagegod> I think I have it
[08:14:44] <suedoh> i see, $('* #srvClick').each(
[08:14:46] <suedoh> that worked :)
[08:14:48] <suedoh> thanks
[08:14:54] <suedoh> i hope this is okay on all browsers
[08:15:10] <johnkpaul> suedoh: it is not ok at all, why are you unable to change your html?
[08:15:34] <suedoh> i can change the HTML
[08:15:39] <suedoh> I asked, what you believe is the best procedure for this?
[08:15:45] <suedoh> I have many links, what should I do?
[08:16:24] <johnkpaul> suedoh: use a class
[08:16:28] <suedoh> Okay will do.
[08:16:54] <suedoh> Also I have noticed many times now, there are jQuery plugins who add custom attributes to a HTML Element, such as   <div id="bleh"  data-role="Something"> .... </div>
[08:17:13] <suedoh> wups
[08:17:25] <suedoh> So these custom attributes, such as  data-bleh, data-blah, etc..
[08:17:30] <suedoh> Are these okay in HTML4 and HTML5?
[08:17:44] <kryl> How to print "myId" with this command it's not clear for me ? $('#myId').bind('click', function(e) {alert(e.attr('id'));}
[08:17:47] <skylamer`> 5
[08:18:03] <skylamer`> kryl
[08:18:10] <skylamer`> $(this).attr("id")
[08:18:19] <danheberden> also, `this.id`
[08:18:22] <johnkpaul> suedoh: what do you mean "ok"? they won't validate html4 but I don't know how much you need to care
[08:18:25] <skylamer`> m hm
[08:18:32] <danheberden> as id is a property of that dom element, and getting ".id" works in all browsers
[08:18:36] <skylamer`> yea
[08:18:43] <shoky> jawhn:  http://jsfiddle.net/AVZJh/511/
[08:18:46] <danheberden> also, $(this).prop('id')
[08:18:48] <suedoh> basically I'm asking if these  data-  custom attributes are okay with jQuery in all browsers?
[08:18:54] <danheberden> not attr
[08:19:04] <suedoh> for example when you try to do  $(this).attr('data-role')
[08:19:06] <johnkpaul> suedoh: yes, that's fine
[08:19:08] <shoky> jawhn:  when you use a <div> the datepicker div is a child of your div. but <input>s cant have children
[08:19:11] <suedoh> okay awesome, thanks
[08:19:27] <skylamer`> suedoh, when doit with js its fine
[08:19:32] <jawhn> shoky: that makes sense, thanks much
[08:19:35] <kryl> and if I push $(this) to an other function and try to get attr from this function ?
[08:19:38] <suedoh> skylamer`, thanks
[08:20:02] <skylamer`> kryl yes
[08:20:15] <skylamer`> you can save it in a var\, or plain push it
[08:21:19] <kryl> cool thank you :)
[08:25:59] <garbagegod> I have a variable with the ID of an element I want to run a function on
[08:26:07] <garbagegod> How do I pass it to the function as an ID?
[08:26:16] <garbagegod> er well
[08:26:30] <garbagegod> $(idvar).lightbox_me(); like that
[08:26:32] <garbagegod> but not stupid
[08:26:53] <shoky> $('#' + idvar).lightbox_me()  ?
[08:26:56] <NoiseEee> garbagegod: $('#'+idvar).lightbox_me()
[08:27:11] <NoiseEee> garbagegod: this is pretty basic stuff.  you should familiarize yourself with JS
[08:27:16] <garbagegod> FIGURES
[08:27:34] <garbagegod> I was going to try that but then I thought, no, that would make way too much sense, I'm sure it wouldn't work.
[08:27:41] <NoiseEee> instead of just sticking things in right away and seeing if it works, take a moment and think
[08:27:47] <NoiseEee> advice from my wife <rimshot>
[08:27:59] <shoky> hhh...
[08:29:18] <garbagegod> NoiseEee: I get enough advice from my imaginary friends ty
[08:29:26] <garbagegod> I got it working thanks guys
[08:33:41] <Narcissus> Hi - I am using jqgrid to display some information, and have add/edit/delete buttons within it - however I want to edit the information on a new page within the current window
[08:33:47] <Narcissus> any ideas on how I could do that?
[08:34:59] <jholloman> @Narcissus try a modal dialog popup on click of the line
[08:35:20] <jholloman> that has fields filled in with current information, and then save them on exit back to the grid
[08:46:29] <BMCouto> Hi, i have <foo><bar/></foo> - how do i trigger click only on foo but not on bar?
[08:49:00] <Famic> BMCouto: check stopPropagation()
[08:50:47] <BMCouto> Famic:  children().stopPropagation() ?
[08:51:22] <silverwind> stopPropagation is an event method... so no
[08:52:14] <Famic> BMCouto: I would just use $('foo').trigger('click'); as I never noticed it was firing any child event, but if you have issue with that, stopPropagation() is the function you want to read about
[08:53:21] <Famic> I guess it's a matter of using function(e){e.stopPropagation() where you declare the action for bar
[08:55:45] <danieldeusing> isnt it possible to load an external page content into an DOMWindow ? i get a blank Window
[08:59:14] <Carlitta87> I tried to create a slider that has an auto width, problem is the slider isn't going forward... http://jsfiddle.net/9HcqF/
[08:59:59] <ezio> if i'm creating a plugin with options, and one of those options is an option for additional fields, and the user assigns the value as { id: id } ... how do i always get the most up to date value of id before submitting?
[09:03:02] <shoky> Carlitta87:   $active is the <img>  so $active.next()  will always be empty
[09:05:06] <innociv> How do I debug a "too much recursion" error in firefox?
[09:10:27] <antihero> any idea where removeOverlay went in google maps API v3?
[09:17:03] <hashpuppy> i'm writing a plugin and i want to limit it to only one selector.  can i just use this[0] instead of return this.each(function(){ ... }); is this common?  should i handle this any differently?
[09:17:31] <shoky> you mean limit to only one element?
[09:19:39] <hashpuppy> yeah
[09:19:41] <hashpuppy> thanks
[09:20:31] <shoky> this[0] should be fine
[09:20:42] <innociv> Ugh.
[09:20:58] <innociv> Upgrading from 1.5.2 to 1.7.2 I get a too much recursion error in firefox that freezes up the browser.
[09:21:11] <shoky> and in chrome?
[09:21:19] <innociv> Nope.
[09:21:21] <innociv> Works fine
[09:21:40] <shoky> no error at all?
[09:22:46] <innociv> Correct
[09:23:35] <shoky> dunno ;p
[09:24:59] <shoky> set up breakpoints and dive in, i guess
[09:27:22] <innociv> hm
[09:27:25] <innociv> I found it actualy
[09:27:28] <innociv> chrome made a breakpoint
[09:27:49] <innociv> oh wiat nope still looping in ff
[09:28:41] <innociv> IT actually appears that firebug is makign the erro
[09:28:46] <innociv> firebug line 4290
[09:29:05] <shoky> ;S
[09:31:24] <innociv> Oh god this is so stupid
[09:32:08] <innociv> Eh na still does it with ff off.
[09:45:35] <xnotte> i need to write a var in a jquery plugin ShadowBox,  with html content, but it only accepts if its inline, not a block of code. How can i do a big html code inside that var ? i have this line-> content:    '<div id="shadowbox-content">This test will appear inside shadowbox</div>', but i want to have a big html code not inline
[09:49:54] <Brodingo> xnotte you could load it
[09:49:59] <Brodingo> ?load url @ xnotte
[09:49:59] <caniuse> Brodingo: .load(): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[09:50:30] <Brodingo> caniuse that is not correct you silly
[09:51:26] <Brodingo> where is our true beloved robo warrior
[09:51:40] <ezio> i'm beloved
[09:52:22] <Brodingo> that remains to be seen
[09:52:24] <johnline> im mclovin
[09:54:03] <shoky> im batman
[09:54:29] <xnotte> ok brodingo thanks
[09:56:13] <johnline> my parents are ded
[09:58:10] <Brodingo> xnotte make sure youre using load as the ajax method, that link wasnt right
[10:02:11] <xnotte> Brodingo: how ?
[10:03:19] <shoky> xnotte can you explain your question
[10:03:37] <Brodingo> xnotte by just passing the url ex .load('more-stuff.html')
[10:03:59] <danheberden> Brodingo fyi: http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11733
[10:04:22] <Brodingo> o rly
[10:04:37] <Brodingo> thanks danheberden
[10:04:38] <danheberden> realry
[10:04:42] <xnotte> ok thanls Brodingo
[10:05:06] <danheberden> Brodingo did you get tickets to txjs?
[10:05:16] <Brodingo> mmhmm
[10:05:21] <danheberden> awwwwwwwww yeah
[10:06:53] <opalepatrick> I would like to show a div containing some details on mouseover so that it hovers over the content. The details are ajax and a separate thing but can anyone point me at some info/tutorials that may be appropriate?
[10:25:19] <ezio> if i'm creating a plugin with options, and one of those options is an option for additional fields, and the user assigns the value as { id: id } ... how do i always get the most up to date value of id before submitting?
[10:25:46] <ezio> innociv, you stop a function from calling itself
[10:26:10] <ezio> { "hello" }
[10:26:15] <innociv> I don't really see any place that that's happening
[10:26:19] <innociv> And it's not making an error on chrome
[10:27:11] <Whirl3d> Why they ain't never got nothin in Atlanta? No jqueryAtlanta conference or jSAtlanta?
[10:27:21] <ezio> function a (){b()};  function b(){c();}; function c(){a();}
[10:27:24] <ezio> innociv,
[10:27:37] <innociv> Right, but it's only happening in firefox with jquery 1.7.2
[10:27:46] <innociv> With jquery 1.5.2 or not any other browser it doesn't happen
[10:28:26] <ezio> do you know how to debug?
[10:28:42] <b6> can this type of post be done with .ajax()? https://api.imgur.com/examples#uploading_js
[10:29:04] <gho5t> if I have li.foo, how can I wrap all children of li.foo in .content? so it would result in <li class="foo"><div class="content">...</div></li>
[10:30:03] <b6> gho5t: maybe $('li.foo *').addClass('content'), not exactly sure.
[10:30:16] <gho5t> umm yeah don't think so
[10:31:08] <gho5t> $('li.foo').wrapInner() wouldn't work  right
[10:31:12] <gho5t> it would wrap each child?
[10:31:33] <Whirl3d> how about $("li.foo").children().wrap("<div class='content'/>");
[10:31:57] <gho5t> would that wrap each child?
[10:32:02] <ezio> yes
[10:32:11] <ezio> i was trying to do it like that but i didn't know about wrap
[10:32:45] <ezio> if i'm creating a plugin with options, and one of those options is an option for additional fields, and the user assigns the value as { id: id } ... how do i always get the most up to date value of id before submitting?
[10:32:46] <gho5t> let me try that and wrapInner and see
[10:32:49] <christo_m> Hi, im trying to manually fire off a .fullCalendar('next') when a click event on an element occurs.. however it takes a while because it actually fetches events for a bunch of calendars, so id like to put the ajax loading swirl on (just adding a class to some div) and then remove it when the 'next' completes, how can i do this?
[10:33:19] <Whirl3d> how about var kids=$("li.foo").children(); $("li.foo").append("<div class='content'/>"); $("li.foo .content").append(kids);
[10:33:45] <gho5t> ezio: updating an option can be arranged to fire a callback
[10:33:57] <gho5t> at least when using the widget factory
[10:35:55] <gho5t> Whirl3d: actually wrapInner seems to do the trick
[10:36:06] <suedoh> Hi all, when I have a <tr> w/ display: none, and then I use jQuery to display:block it, for some reason the colspan property doesn't take effect.
[10:36:25] <suedoh> Any idea on why this happens?  Is it because colspan property takes effect on DOM load?
[10:38:24] <silverwind> Perhaps because a tr isn't a block element to begin with?
[10:38:39] <christo_m> The closest thing i could find is the eventAfterRender but what i actually need is a calendarAfterRender
[10:39:03] <suedoh> silverwind, What would you suggest to do for this situation?
[10:40:24] <silverwind> suedoh, Create a class called hidden in CSS that does "display: none;" then apply/remove it from the tr
[10:40:42] <suedoh> silverwind, Well that is the problem
[10:41:00] <suedoh> See, the colspan property doesn't seem to apply inside a hidden tr
[10:41:19] <suedoh> So when I use jQuery to set the css to block, the colspan isn't applied, so it's not displaying properly
[10:41:22] <celeritas> tr is a table-row, not a block
[10:41:26] <silverwind> ...
[10:41:35] <suedoh> I don't do colspan on the tr
[10:41:41] <d3f4ultr0> hey guys, other than mRemote, what do you use?
[10:41:42] <suedoh> The colspan is inside the tr, in a <td></td>
[10:42:00] <silverwind> suedoh, but since you made the tr a block element...
[10:42:05] <suedoh> oh
[10:42:06] <silverwind> suedoh, It's not a table row anymore.
[10:42:11] <suedoh> now i understand, I'm sorry
[10:42:17] * suedoh is kind of slow today
[10:42:20] <suedoh> just waking up :)
[10:42:24] <celeritas> lol
[10:42:25] <silverwind> So add/remove a class with display:none in it
[10:42:28] <celeritas> same here
[10:42:33] <gho5t> wait so there's display: table-row?
[10:42:49] <gho5t> TIL ^^
[10:42:50] <celeritas> gho5t yes
[10:43:03] <species> would it be too pretentious to putmy CV online and layout using css?
[10:43:06] <zulu-gula> how to make selectbox to be like dropdown, I mean options only below displayed option?
[10:43:56] <silverwind> gho5t, They're unusable on older shitty browser though :/
[10:44:09] <suedoh> interesting, so a <tr> by default is  'table-row' in javascript
[10:44:12] <silverwind> species, IMHO, that would be great
[10:44:15] <suedoh> is this standard in all browsers?
[10:44:34] <silverwind> suedoh, IE7 doesn't understand that...
[10:44:36] <celeritas> its the standard
[10:44:36] <christo_m> any beter way than this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9272005/jquery-full-calendar-callback-after-the-calendar-has-loaded-completely
[10:46:18] <dnsdds> Is there a delay to .html()? I'm having functions that require elements created by .html() that fail sometimes and work sometimes with no rhyme or reason; is there a callback?
[10:47:10] <pachet> it depends what you mean by delay
[10:47:32] <pachet> there's always a computative delay when you apply changes to the dom
[10:47:46] <pachet> but its done within the control flow, in this case at least
[10:47:46] <NoiseEee> should your .html() stuff perhaps *be* in a callback?  sounds like you're complaining about some async stuff, offhand
[10:50:17] <pachet> i guess to clarify:
[10:50:25] <pachet> dnsdds: changes to the dom markup are blocking
[10:50:38] <pachet> dnsdds: but those changes might trigger reflow/repaint
[10:50:44] <pachet> which is not blocking
[10:51:08] <catcher> Anyone had luck with .scroll()? I can't seem to get the event to fire.
[10:53:22] <dnsdds> NoiseEee: It is. I get stuff from AJAX, and then run .html() and my functions in the callback
[10:53:47] <Back2Basics> how can I load the payload into an ajax+json call?  (if I modify it, it breaks)  here is what I have now
[10:53:49] <Back2Basics>                     data: JSON.stringify({hello: 'world',lang:{name:'me',lname:'me2'}}),
[10:53:55] <dnsdds> pachet: In liberal arts major terms?
[10:53:57] <__null> https://gist.github.com/6c5e5b7bab30a4ae3bb1 - why are all the buttons behaving like the last button in the iteration?
[10:54:28] <christo_m> Hi, im trying to manually fire off a .fullCalendar('next') when a click event on an element occurs.. however it takes a while because it actually fetches events for a bunch of calendars, so id like to put the ajax loading swirl on (just adding a class to some div) and then remove it when the 'next' completes, how can i do this?
[10:54:39] <christo_m> I just want to know when all the events for a calendar have been loaded
[10:55:23] <celeritas> because kk is set inside the callback
[10:55:52] <Back2Basics> all that does is statically assign those values  I can't include a variable in there from a form value.
[10:56:00] <__null> where should it be set?
[10:56:49] <Back2Basics> christo_m: that one is hard.  what is ALL?
[10:57:05] <celeritas> christo_m https://gist.github.com/f517499d34db8a8b07df
[10:57:19] <pachet> dnsdds: you can change the dom from javascript, which isnt directly changing the way the page looks
[10:57:25] <pachet> that job is done by the browser *when* the dom changes
[10:57:29] <christo_m> Back2Basics: i have multiple calendars generated into a single page
[10:57:30] <celeritas> lol sorry christo_m, i meant __null
[10:57:52] <pachet> meaning, changes to the dom can cause the browser to queue a redraw of page contents
[10:57:57] <christo_m> Back2Basics: i have buttons to fire off the fullCalendar('next') methods for each calendar
[10:58:02] <__null> thanks celeritas
[10:58:03] <species> anybody else here hire web developers, and think an online resume done in css is a good idea, and not at all pretentious?
[10:58:04] <Back2Basics> christo_m: well do you call each separately? or can you do it in one get/post request
[10:58:13] <Back2Basics> christo_m: ok nvm
[10:58:24] <christo_m> Back2Basics: each ones fetched separately, i basically want to know when all the ajax requests are done
[10:58:41] <Back2Basics> species: I do.  (for small projects)
[10:58:42] <christo_m> because right now, events render out of order, id rather show a little loader thingy and have them all appear at once once all the requests are done.
[10:59:03] <silverwind> species, I think it's a must.
[10:59:23] <species> Back2Basics: would you like to see a css one or would you rather have an ms word one like the ones ive applied to so far :|
[10:59:27] <christo_m>  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9272005/jquery-full-calendar-callback-after-the-calendar-has-loaded-completely   , this fix doesn't really do the trick, as it says "complete" because the calendars loaded, but the ajax request is not complete
[11:00:35] <Back2Basics> species:  I generally look for a coder who codes clearly.   (form should follow function so MS Word is really out)
[11:00:48] <species> hmm theres a good point
[11:01:04] <species> they will be critquing a code style that ive not adapted to their way of working
[11:01:13] <species> if I work in a team I use the same style(s) the team generally uses
[11:01:27] <species> they might assume my coding style is absolute like it is for so many people
[11:01:31] <Back2Basics> species: or you could have different styles for the same html
[11:01:45] <species> i mean coding style not css
[11:02:24] <christo_m> I just need a way to know that the entire eventSource is fetched for fullcalendar
[11:02:26] <christo_m> thats i.t
[11:02:28] <christo_m> it*
[11:02:30] <celeritas> christo_m, try http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_data/loading/
[11:02:50] <christo_m> ahhh i didnt see that
[11:02:54] <christo_m> celeritas: im gonna try it , thank you!
[11:03:20] <Back2Basics> species: it is a way to eliminate candidates.   But usually the clarity of the front page will trump coding style.
[11:03:50] <species> problem is i'll still have to send a .doc version
[11:04:11] <Back2Basics> species: that is usually a problem with HR at companies.
[11:04:17] <species> some of the sites ive been using to job search expect .doc (i.e office 97 format |: )
[11:04:59] <Back2Basics> species: have you used ajax/json before?
[11:05:48] <christo_m> celeritas: taht did the trick
[11:06:00] <species> Back2Basics: yes.
[11:06:06] <species> what are you suggesting?
[11:06:22] <Back2Basics> species: do you have a paypal account?
[11:06:24] <species> have a .doc version available?
[11:06:39] <species> Back2Basics: not currently, it fell into disuse.
[11:06:43] <species> ... why?
[11:06:52] <species> are you offering me a job? :D
[11:07:28] <Back2Basics> species: do you have a website I can check out.  (I don't need the word doc)
[11:08:00] <species> actually no, that was what im planning to do (i have a site, but not a CV on it, its a game I wrote for a 48hr game dev competition)
[11:08:10] <species> the code for that is TERRIBLE because no time
[11:08:55] <species> world's buggiest game ever, http://www.zombiebovine.com/buggygame.php
[11:09:41] <species> Back2Basics: during my internship I worked on the site www.icheev.com, but its not all my work - i was working with other students. bits of my code and bits of other's code is in there.
[11:10:01] <pachet> javascript highlander
[11:10:04] <pachet> there can be only one
[11:12:20] <Back2Basics> species: that would be a great resume item (deadline work)  I'm going down to Austin this weekend for hacking for a cause thing.
[11:12:26] <christo_m> celeritas: need a little help with the logic here
[11:12:36] <christo_m> celeritas: so each calendar has a loading callback, and i can test the bool isLoading
[11:12:46] <species> Back2Basics: im actually in the UK anyway, and wasn't looking to telecommute (or expatriate)
[11:12:56] <species> hacking for a cause? what cause?
[11:12:56] <christo_m> celeritas: how would i know that theyre all done?, i can tell when one or some are done, but how do i know theyre all done?
[11:12:59] <christo_m> and how could i test
[11:13:01] <sebastian_o|> hey guys
[11:13:06] <christo_m> i basically want each isLoading to be false.
[11:13:21] <Back2Basics> species: you know js better than I do.
[11:13:46] <Back2Basics> species: takes me 2 weeks to make 15 lines to work.
[11:13:50] <sebastian_o|> how do you create an input type password using jquery in IE7 ?
[11:14:06] <species> Back2Basics: the code for that game is actually very bad - it has lots of "bad practice" etc, because I decided to simplify everything and save time
[11:14:13] <Back2Basics> msg me your email
[11:14:22] <pachet> sebastian_o|: same as you would for any other browser
[11:14:31] <pachet> thats the beauty of a dom abstraction lib :[
[11:14:40] <gf3> Hola sebastian_o|
[11:14:46] <pachet> $('<input/>', { type : 'password' })
[11:14:54] <sebastian_o|> I'm afraid that that's whay I was expecting but doesn't happen
[11:15:05] <sebastian_o|> NO U gf3  !!
[11:15:09] <gf3> NO NO U
[11:15:15] <sebastian_o|> you're everything!
[11:15:27] <sebastian_o|> you're big brother man
[11:15:37] <gf3> Haha
[11:15:41] <sebastian_o|> so jquerying huh?  :)
[11:16:12] <sebastian_o|> pachet: ok, testing..
[11:16:32] <pachet> sebastian_o|: im fairly sure you can create them with whatever type you want
[11:16:48] <pachet> but its true that for preexistant elements, trying to change the type of an input will give you an error in ie<8
[11:17:15] <sebastian_o|> sure, the thing I was reading was about not being able to use type from attr, it seems it has to be created with the right type
[11:17:25] <sebastian_o|> anyways.. testing
[11:23:01] <sebastian_o|> ok chrome is happy with it lets see the beast
[11:32:29] <balazs> what is the RESTful name for a resource that updates a user's email ? POST => '/ajax/user' ?
[11:32:48] <balazs> I'm trying to get a feel for best practices
[11:32:53] <joe_ionearth> hi all... ive got an app design question...
[11:33:36] <silverwind> balazs, you would put at /ajax/user/<userid>
[11:33:36] <sebastian_o|> yeah it works in IE7 alright
[11:33:48] <sebastian_o|> thanks for the tip pachet
[11:34:20] <balazs> silverwind: how does the HTML look for that ?
[11:34:21] <joe_ionearth> anyone have any spare time for some advice?
[11:34:50] <pachet> ?ask
[11:34:51] <joe_ionearth> im writing a gps tracking app using google maps and codeigninter/php
[11:34:58] <silverwind> balazs, You asked about a RESTful API, not html
[11:35:07] <joe_ionearth> in the past ive use getJSON for all my requests
[11:35:11] <joe_ionearth> works great
[11:35:38] <joe_ionearth> but in looking into using the codeigniter framework, i was playing around with using CI to make my requests for json
[11:36:04] <joe_ionearth> the CI guys says this is perfectly normal, and to just pass the json obj back the client, and thats working fine too
[11:36:45] <joe_ionearth> then i looked at my javascript source in the browser from the rendered CI view
[11:36:54] <joe_ionearth> and it looks like this: http://screencast.com/t/lSEPjs35BAp
[11:37:36] <joe_ionearth> $telem_json = $this -> proxy -> site('http://dev.ionearth.com/api/new/ionearth_telem/2921/1331527800');				
[11:37:37] <balazs> silverwind: maybe I'm misunderstanding something. I'd like a RESTful API, but I ASSume that a web browser would be able to use it.
[11:37:38] <joe_ionearth> 				Template::set('telem_data', $telem_json);
[11:38:17] <enoch> hi all
[11:38:26] <joe_ionearth> my question is, from a design perspective is it harmful to have those long json vars stuck in my source like that?
[11:38:38] <silverwind> balazs, You can use a RESTful API without hacks only from AJAX
[11:39:00] <silverwind> balazs, Because you don't have access to all the HTTP verbs in standard HTML form.
[11:39:04] <enoch> http://pastebin.com/qjYfFALQ this code gives me this error: "unterminated string literal" why?
[11:39:27] <joe_ionearth> or should i just go back to my standard getJSON
[11:39:35] <joe_ionearth> with jQuery??
[11:39:49] <silverwind> balazs, To update a user, you would PUT to /yourapi/users/balazs
[11:40:41] <balazs> using something like $.put("/ajax/user/ + user_id ?
[11:40:49] <joe_ionearth> has anyone ever considered these two dif. app designs?
[11:40:57] <silverwind> balazs, You can only access the PUT verb with $.ajax
[11:41:06] <balazs> oh ok
[11:42:02] <enoch> http://pastebin.com/qjYfFALQ this code gives me this error: "unterminated string literal" why?
[11:43:45] <johnkpaul> enoch: depends on what $banner in your php is
[11:43:52] <Xtrivity> Hey guys, i'm having an issue with page transition. On a mobile device, if I do the slide transition from one page to another, the whole second page almost has the same effect as when you "add new page" on IOS Safari, and then renders and page becomes full size...
[11:43:59] <Xtrivity> now when i change the orientation to landscape and then back to horizontal.. the effect loads perfectly
[11:44:01] <enoch> damn
[11:44:10] <enoch> solved removing al whitespaces
[11:44:10] <enoch> ;)
[11:44:21] <balazs> silverwind: what's the usual way for authenticating the user ? cookies ? a parameter to the PUT script that has some encrypted session info ?
[11:45:16] <balazs> cookies look way too browser specific
[11:45:49] <NoiseEee> enoch: usually a token in the header request
[11:46:29] <NoiseEee> enoch: look into http://oauth.net/2/ and other ideas
[11:47:15] <silverwind> balazs, In a pure RESTful API, the authentication is done at every request.
[11:47:41] <silverwind> balazs, The fact that the API is stateless is important.
[11:47:55] <silverwind> That's a reason why REST is so scalable.
[11:48:58] <balazs> so what does the client send for every request ?
[11:50:10] <Xtrivity> can anybody help me debug this slide transition. I honestly can't figure out how to do it. Everytime the slide transition the Safari (IOS) URL bar comes down and sizes stuff all wierd and then on orientation change it works fine.. makes not sense
[11:50:13] <NoiseEee> balazs: : usually a token in the header request
[11:59:49] <Mike-B> Could someone please explain why something like  function m(l) { id=$(l).attr('id'); alert(l)}  returned id in 1.5.2 but in 1.7.2 returns object object ?
[12:00:28] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: that function should return undefined with any version of jquery
[12:00:32] <Mike-B> I would use it like this..  m($("#myid");
[12:00:34] <innociv> Erm how do I set a global function?  I thought I simply fnName = function(){};  But it's not defined outside my script, there.
[12:01:03] <johnkpaul> innociv: that will work as long as there's no var named fnName defined in your current scope
[12:01:17] <johnkpaul> you can be explicit about it and type window.fnName= function(){}; innociv
[12:01:55] <innociv> Odd.  Getting undefined, and when I look in the dom insepctor I don't see it.  I see my obj = {}; right above it, though.
[12:02:00] <Mike-B> johnkpaul: Its been working until we changed to 1.7.2 got back to 1.5.2 and its fine,  I realise that I probably doing something wrong but had been getting away with it.
[12:02:19] <johnkpaul> innociv: the dom inspector?
[12:02:26] <johnkpaul> creating a global variable won't do anything with the dom inspector
[12:02:31] <innociv> Nevermind
[12:02:44] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: I'm going to need to see more of your code to understand, what you've shown here has no return value
[12:02:50] <innociv> I did something so dumb, I'm not even going to say what
[12:04:06] <Mike-B> johnkpaul: okay, Thought so, I think the real issue is that I dont understand something trival so if you dont mine please stick with me while I ask some stupid questions :)
[12:04:29] <johnkpaul> sure, go ahead Mike-B
[12:04:30] <Mike-B> Code not easy to paste anywhere, and well messy but working on 1.5.2
[12:04:46] <sebastian_o|> what other nomenclature do I have for creating inputs?  like this:  $(''<input />'', {type: ''password''})   ???
[12:05:12] <NoiseEee> traditional JS
[12:05:34] <sebastian_o|> there is a way to do it without having to use < > s?
[12:06:02] <NoiseEee> don't think so
[12:06:18] <sebastian_o|> mmm
[12:06:31] <skylamer`> a=createElement("input"),a.type="password"
[12:06:35] <Mike-B> So I have a div id=to, it attach an onchange $('#to').change(function(){ makeblock($('#to');})  I know i could use this or something but haven't.
[12:07:25] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: so what is your actual problem?
[12:07:44] <Mike-B> the function makeblock would then look like function makeblock(l) { I want to use the object in here as l eg val=$(l).val() ...
[12:08:20] <Mike-B> It was working but that does not work using 1.7.2 it would return object object not the value
[12:08:29] <Mike-B> but in 1.5.2 it returns the value.
[12:08:41] <rakm> does jquery have a function to paramaterize (hyphenate or underscore) a string with spaces?
[12:08:54] <NoiseEee> rakm: natural JS.
[12:09:09] <rakm> NoiseEee what should I use?
[12:09:24] <rakm> (i know wrong channel to ask)
[12:09:33] <NoiseEee> rakm: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace
[12:10:12] <Mike-B> I could pass makeblock('to')  then function(i){document.getElementById(l);...  But also I may want to so something like $(x).parent().attr('id');
[12:10:18] <rakm> …yeah that was way easier than I thought it would be. thanks NoiseEee
[12:10:41] <Mike-B> So real question is how to pass an object and use it in jquery $(object). syntax
[12:11:32] <Mike-B> I want to pass the object and not a string value of the id of an object.
[12:12:00] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: $() works fine if it is passed a jquery object anyway
[12:12:12] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle @ Mike-B
[12:12:18] <johnkpaul> can you put the function in question into a paste?
[12:13:33] <Mike-B> johnkpaul: I will try and make a sand box its actually very complicated and behaves differently between versions and when called on ready seems okay but not when called as a result of on change.
[12:14:04] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: even the code by itself, in non working state would be hepful to understand your question
[12:14:04] <Mike-B> I know im not making any sense, its why I can google it very well I just cant find the words to describe :)
[12:17:54] <Mike-B> johnkpaul: http://pastebin.ca/2157324
[12:18:02] <Mike-B> I know its a mess :)
[12:18:29] <Mike-B> Its a mixture of pure and jquery and that may be the problem.
[12:19:12] <Mike-B> Basically, if textarea id=to changes then grab it lookup check for email match and create span
[12:19:49] <johnkpaul> :) I hate to say that I've seen worse, but I have, and that's only 50 lines, I was expecting a thousand
[12:20:18] <johnkpaul> so every time #to changes value and loses focus, you run makeContactBlocksFunc
[12:20:44] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: that whole block of code doesn't haev the word "return" anywhere
[12:20:48] <Mike-B> basically yep, there is also a to, cc bcc are you getting the idea.
[12:20:50] <johnkpaul> so I am still confused by your original question
[12:21:30] <Mike-B> nop no return bad me I know. Im curious why it works on 1.5.2 but not 1.7.2
[12:21:49] <cybuch> hi guys
[12:22:15] <Mike-B> see line 29  on 1.5.2 that returns 'to' but on 1.7.2 it returns object object
[12:23:02] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: ah ok, try changing that line to list = l.get(0).id
[12:23:22] <Mike-B> I can cure this by passing 'to' and not $('#to') to the function then in the function doing something like l=getElementById(x);
[12:25:16] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: did you make the change that I said?
[12:26:12] <Mike-B> I sort of get the .get(0) but has something changes in 1.7.2 as it did work before.  Could you explain how $('#to') is different to document.getElementById('to') and also should $(document.getElementById('to')).attr('id') return to? and be the same as $('#to').attr('id') ?
[12:26:36] <Mike-B> johnkpaul: I think I did try that change earlier but I will add it again.
[12:27:19] <johnkpaul> the answer to both of your yes or no questions is yes
[12:27:31] <Mike-B> Really want to understand if what I was already doing was wrong and if so could I pass $('#to').get(0) instead?  I want l to be THE(1) object not a list
[12:28:14] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: $("#to") is a jquery object wrapped around a dom element
[12:29:04] <Mike-B> Ah so to use it I would l.attr('id')  not $(l).attr('id') ?
[12:29:16] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: yes
[12:30:07] <Mike-B> That may be where im going wrong, I feel like I need to begin with $( to use attr('id');
[12:30:24] <johnkpaul> $("#to").attr("id") should return "to"
[12:30:32] <Mike-B> see line 29 list = $(l).attr("id");   Should it be list = l.attr("id");
[12:31:16] <Mike-B> $("#to").attr("id") should return "to"  would but I dont know #to I know l which is #('#to')
[12:31:22] <jamescarr> hey if someone clicks a link, how can I make it toggle a checkbox adjacent to the link?
[12:31:36] <Mike-B> johnkpaul: Thanks for helping me, I know its like pulling teath :)
[12:31:39] <jamescarr> I have an ul with each li containing a checkbox and an anchor
[12:32:19] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: no problem, I don't understand the last phrase that you said "but I don't know #to I know which is #('#to')"
[12:32:21] <heoa> How can I specify in 2D 200px times 200px -box to move a ball from (10,10) to (10,20)?
[12:32:22] <johnkpaul> that makes no sense
[12:32:40] <heoa> Do I need canvas for that or can I do it with jQuery?
[12:32:55] <cybuch> Hello, anyone got an idea how to read file from directory with JSON?
[12:33:22] <Mike-B> johnkpaul: #to would be absolute want to pass and object becuase the function runs on several textareas.
[12:34:03] <johnkpaul> ok, so then pass the string, and constrcut the jquery object in your function
[12:34:09] <johnkpaul> or actually, you can just pass "this" from your change handler
[12:34:19] <balazs> cybuch: that doesn't make much sense
[12:34:31] <Mike-B> jamescarr: try closest('li').find('input:checkbox')  or something like that  sorry not expert but have done something similar before.
[12:34:59] <Mike-B> johnkpaul: I could just pass this.   but can I use this.attr('id')  or this.value() etc ?
[12:35:00] <cybuch> balazs: Yes I know, but my teacher wants me to do it. Shall I laugh at him and do it in other way?
[12:35:31] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: no, but you can use $(this).attr('id') or $(this).val
[12:35:33] <balazs> how about asking to clarify :)
[12:35:34] <Mike-B> I still cant workout what change between 1.5.2 and 1.7.2
[12:35:39] <johnkpaul> there is no .value() btw, Mike-B
[12:36:03] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: I have no idea, you haven't completely pinned down the difference that you're finding, or at least you haven't communicated it to me
[12:36:05] <Mike-B> oops sorry ment val() :o
[12:38:01] <cybuch> balazs: well I shall give him finished project I think
[12:38:20] <cybuch> balazs: and he's strange guy, he says one thing and requires another
[12:38:26] <Mike-B> johnkpaul: Im sorry, please keep trying with me :),    forget on click,  I have a line of JS that wants to call the function makecantactblocks,  I need to tell the function that the object to act on is $('#to')  so I write makecontactblocks($('#'));  thinking that im passing the object
[12:38:37] <cybuch> balazs: so maybe I should just do it another way?
[12:39:10] <Mike-B> the function mackcontactblocks(l)  catches the object in l, then I use that to get the value  v=$(l).val();
[12:39:15] <poppiez> hi, I'm using $.animate to animate two images from right to left. the images fit their container and is downscaled most of the time. this can cause a bit of lagginess in some browsers. any way to optimize that?
[12:40:49] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: so for this to be as generic as possible, why not always pass the dom object directly
[12:40:52] <balazs> cybuch: idk
[12:40:59] <johnkpaul> so in change() you write makecontactblocks(this)
[12:41:03] <balazs> sounds like there's some major miscommunication
[12:41:14] <johnkpaul> and make contacts block is defined as function makecontactsblocks(textareaDomElement)
[12:41:21] <cybuch> balazs: the only thing that comes to my mind - make a json array with file list and that's all
[12:41:32] <cybuch> balazs: no, he's weirdo, believe me ; )
[12:41:58] <Mike-B> johnkpaul: to confirm, l=$('#to');  can I l.val(), or $(l).val()  or $(l).get(0) or l=$('#to').get(0)  ;
[12:42:19] <johnkpaul> Mike-B: I don't understand your question
[12:42:54] <Mike-B> I get the makecontactblocks(this)   but what If I want to call it from elsewhere not this  can I makecontactsblock($('#to'))  is that not the same?
[12:44:53] <Mike-B> im trying to understand what $(x)  is expecting  I think that x=document.getElementById('to') is not that same as x=$('#to')  but im not sure why. is it the same as $('#to').get(0) ?
[12:45:11] <johnkpaul> in the code you showed me earlier makecontactsblocks(this) is equivalent to makecontactsblocks($('#to').get(0))
[12:45:32] <johnkpaul> the $ function returns a jquery object, a jquery object is not the same that you get from document.getElementById
[12:45:36] <Mike-B> johnkpaul: I suspect your frustraited with me now, I would be so I understand if you want me to go away and read some stuff :)
[12:46:08] <johnkpaul> document.getElementById returns a dom element, $ returns a jquery object, which is a wrapper around a variable number of dom elements
[12:48:16] <Mike-B> so can I use a jquery object inside $(jqobj).  or do I just just it like this  jqobj.val()  I feel like I need the $ and I thing that $(x) is expecting x to be a dom not a jq object.
[12:49:09] <Mike-B> I think this is penny that is waiting to drop for me, sorry Im not explaining well.
[12:49:50] <shoky> $(jqobj) is redundant
[12:50:00] <Mike-B> If I have passed a jquery object into a function (l)  how do I use l with value()
[12:50:07] <Mike-B> $(l).value() ?
[12:50:10] <shoky> l.val()
[12:50:27] <shoky> if l is a jquery object you dont need to wrap it with $()
[12:51:00] <Mike-B> shoky: but I want to use the jquery function eg  parent().closest(input).value() or something
[12:51:09] <shoky> there is no jquery function .value()
[12:51:29] <Mike-B> I like to use attr('???')  so how could I use that?
[12:51:40] <shoky> l.attr('???') ?
[12:51:47] <Mike-B> Does that work?
[12:51:54] <shoky> if l is a jqobj
[12:52:01] <Mike-B> hmm
[12:52:13] <Mike-B> maybe that is where i have gone wrong,
[12:52:20] <shoky> ;p
[12:53:05] <Mike-B> I have been passing a jquery object as l but then wrapping in a another $(l)  I could have just done l.attr('id');
[12:53:15] <shoky> yop
[12:53:55] <shoky> some like to always call their jqobj variables prefixed with a $
[12:54:07] <shoky> like:  var $l = $('smth');
[12:54:13] <Mike-B> I wonder if the difference between 1.7.2 and 1.5.2 is that for some reason 1.5.2 coped with the single element object.
[12:54:30] <shoky> and then $( $l )  would stand out
[12:54:39] <Mike-B> Thats smart :)
[12:54:41] <shoky> what do you mean?
[12:56:00] <Mike-B> Well even though It sounds like I had it wrong eg $(l).attr('id')    should have been l.attr('id')  or even neater $l.attr('id')      1.5.2 coped and returend to but 1.7.2 returned object object
[12:56:45] <balazs> what's the difference betweren l and $l ? I assume it's a javascript thing
[12:56:58] <shoky> balazs: nothing, it's just a convention some people use
[12:56:58] <Mike-B> johnkpaul:  Thanks, I think you finally got me there, im going to try these changes I think I understand a lot beter thankyou for you paitence :)
[12:57:19] <johnkpaul> sure, no problem, sorry, I Havent' been paying attention because I haven't been mentioned
[12:57:21] <johnkpaul> glad you got it
[12:57:26] <shoky> jkp jkp jkp
[12:57:35] <shoky> you're always implicitly mentioned man
[12:57:47] <johnkpaul> haha, yeah, I need to find a way to make limechat notify me of jkps
[12:57:48] <Mike-B> he he
[12:57:52] <shoky> ;D
[12:58:15] <johnline> limechat is like limewire?
[12:58:25] <johnkpaul> no, limechat is an irc client
[12:58:29] <johnline> :v
[12:58:36] <shoky> people use limewire?
[12:58:38] <Mike-B> Im using limechat :)
[12:59:02] <johnline> mac only buh
[12:59:04] <silverwind> lol limewire
[12:59:13] <silverwind> Are we in 1995?
[12:59:19] <shoky> we wish
[12:59:25] <Mike-B> oh dear!
[12:59:36] <johnline> if we were i'd be the founder of so many things
[13:00:00] <shoky> i'd found 1996
[13:00:09] * Mike-B is going to see if johnkpaul and shoky suggestions work:)
[13:00:31] <silverwind> I would invest in Apple..
[13:00:45] <silverwind> And google.
[13:01:52] <johnline> and limewire
[13:01:56] <shoky> LOL
[13:02:08] <Mike-B> johnkpaul: or shoky:  So one more question so i got it,  if I use x=$("#to") to get a jqobject can I get from it the dom object?
[13:02:12] <silverwind> Hmm..
[13:02:39] <shoky> Mike-B:   either x[0] or x.get(0)   the former being a teeny bit more performant. and also less typing
[13:02:41] <silverwind> I know, I would create tons of patents and pwn all the companies
[13:03:31] <Mike-B> shoky  Got it :) thanks, Now I under stand what johnkpaul said in his 2nd line to me :)
[13:03:43] <Mike-B> Thanks Guys! :)
[13:03:50] <shoky> ;]
[13:04:00] <Mike-B> Penny well and truly dropped now.
[13:04:35] <Mike-B> Now to learn to write functions with returns :)
[13:04:48] <sadtaco> "Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL http://chat.example.com/ from frame with URL http://tunnel.example.com/messenger/messengeriframe.html. Domains, protocols and ports must match." How do those domains not match?  Chrome gives this error but in FF it works fine.
[13:05:54] <_trev> subdomain.
[13:08:40] <Eviltwin> "chat.example.com" != "tunnel.example.com"
[13:11:06] <sadtaco> Why not? :| Bleh.  How do I get around it?
[13:11:21] <sadtaco> does chat.example.com == example.com or www.example.com at least?
[13:11:27] <shoky> JSONP/CORS
[13:11:55] <sadtaco> from www.example.com to tunnel.example.com works fine.
[13:13:04] <shoky> as to 'why not' - i guess cause different subdomains can be on seperate host/ip
[13:15:10] <Wolf_22> I'm trying to create a function that is called whenever I click on links that have a class of, say, "activate". This function needs to be passed other element IDs (but only 1 argument every time it's called). Is there a way to do this in jquery?
[13:16:02] <antivert> http://pastebin.com/GZYY3MHz  "function statement requires a name" for select: line
[13:16:10] <antivert> that's from the jquery autocomplete example, what am I doing wrong?
[13:16:18] <mrFrog> i have a few menu query objects in $expandable. in the click event, how do i select all $expandable that isn't the one clicked? so that in: $expandable.click(function(event){// i know which ones to close});
[13:19:15] <shoky> Wolf_22: you'd have to elaborate. anything is possible
[13:19:59] <Wolf_22> shoky: Yeah, that's hard to do when half the time it's hard to even understand what I want. haha. I think I might've found a solution anyway. If it doesn't work, I'll come back and try again.
[13:20:12] <shoky> k
[13:20:39] <antivert> please help dudes, I'm in a bind :0
[13:20:41] <antivert> :)
[13:20:44] <antivert> I'm missing some scope or something
[13:20:48] <shoky> antivert:  you have a ;  instead of a ,
[13:21:02] <shoky> before the select:
[13:21:07] <antivert> shoky: THANK YOU
[13:21:12] <shoky> N_P
[13:21:27] <larzen-wrk2> question.. how do I access the options of a button in its click event?
[13:21:35] <shoky> options?
[13:21:41] <larzen-wrk2> this is a jqueryUI question
[13:21:48] <shoky> o.
[13:21:55] <larzen-wrk2>  button({disabled: true});
[13:22:14] <larzen-wrk2> .click event fires whether the button is enabled or disabled.. so I need to check.
[13:23:11] <larzen-wrk2> basically in the click event I need to check if the button has been disabled or not.
[13:23:12] <shoky> well
[13:23:24] <shoky> you just need to .button('option', 'disabled')
[13:23:53] <shoky> as the docs say
[13:24:00] <shoky> var disabled = $( ".selector" ).button( "option", "disabled" );
[13:24:40] <shoky> mrFrog:  you can use .not(this)
[13:24:58] <mrFrog> shoky: ok that's what it was - thank you
[13:28:07] <guilhermekfe> how can I obtain the data-* attribute from a jquery event?
[13:28:16] <guilhermekfe> jquery event object*
[13:28:29] <_trev> $(e.currentTarget).attr("data-")
[13:28:47] <guilhermekfe> _trev: awesome =)
[13:28:51] <guilhermekfe> thank you
[13:29:05] <_trev> Np
[13:34:21] <_trev> $(this).attr("data-*") works too if you don't change context.  Which is I prefer use currentTarget
[13:34:36] <_trev> Rather, if the context is specific to the button.
[13:35:21] <NoiseEee> also fwiw,  val = $(e.currentTarget).data('name');  would also work
[13:37:46] <abes> Question: two different parts of my site require two different .js files (jquery.tools.min.js and jquery.min.js) - the problem is that if I reference both of them, the functionality is broken. How can I determine which parts of each file can be used by both and which are script specific? I run into this a lot and would love to finally have a fix - is there anything like JS merger maybe? :D
[13:38:07] <garbagegod> abes: I would also like to know
[13:39:24] <abes> garbagegod: i think I will just manually analyze the files and whatever functions are in both I will cut them out from one....
[13:41:39] <Wolf_22> If a function is passed a string representation of an HTML element's ID, how can I make said function use this with .css("background-color","red")?
[13:42:15] <johnkpaul> Wolf_22: $(stringRepresentationofID).css()
[13:42:28] <Wolf_22> johnkpaul: Thanks!

[13:46:15] <hydrozen> Hi. I used bind() to attach a mouseover and click event to a link. On Safari Mobile though the first click on a link seems to only trigger the mouseover event but not the click event… and after that the next clicks are good and trigger both. Any ideas why?
[13:48:02] <_trev> I'm not one for mobile knowledge, but does Safari Mobile even have mouseover implemented?
[13:48:08] <jrockjiggz> hydrozen: google search came up with a few answers, check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9696533/jquery-hover-event-on-a-tag-on-mobile-devices
[13:48:26] <_trev> You can't hover on a mobile device.
[13:48:50] <hydrozen> _trev: the events still get triggered though
[13:49:46] <jrockjiggz> does anyone recommend a development ide for making mobile apps? is jquerymobile sufficient?
[13:49:52] <_trev> hydrozen, you could try feature checking.
[13:50:06] <hydrozen> i still dont understand why only the first clicks acts up
[13:50:10] <hydrozen> then all other clicks are fine
[13:50:14] <hydrozen> you can see it on jefo.com
[13:50:21] <hydrozen> the links on the right side with the region names
[13:50:31] <johnkpaul> jrockjiggz: jquery mobile is not an ide
[13:50:47] <johnkpaul> what are you looking for in an ide jrockjiggz?
[13:51:21] <hydrozen> might have to do with mouseout which i guess gets trigged after… not sure
[13:53:00] <_trev> hydrozen,  Perhaps, try feature checking to disable the functionality. if ( !event.targetTouches) { // do desktop stuff }
[13:53:02] <_trev> hydrozen, http://developer.apple.com/library/safari/#documentation/UserExperience/Reference/TouchEventClassReference/TouchEvent/TouchEvent.html
[13:53:17] <hydrozen> thx i'll have a look
[13:54:06] <jrockjiggz> johnkpaul: i'm looking to expand my website's functionality onto the mobile platform, my concern is not being able to support multiple native development cycles. I've looked at a few mobile frameworks that do a good job at emulating a native experience, but its still not as fluid as a true native app.  I'm also looking at a few ides that deploy cross-platform.. but i don't know where to find other recommendatio
[13:56:39] <johnkpaul> jrockjiggz: so what are your needs? you want it to be like a native app but not a native app?
[13:57:57] <bartmax> is it possible to extend jquery ui to include tooltips on the 'days' ? like jetsetter calendar.
[13:58:28] <YellowShadow> Hey I'm having trouble with this bit of code...for some reason the stuff under if (msg == 'BUS_OK') doesn't get called even though msg == BUS_OK
[13:58:30] <YellowShadow> http://pastebin.com/Nvy2GZ6k
[13:58:34] <YellowShadow> What am I doing wrong?
[13:59:36] <shoky> umm
[13:59:53] <shoky> .ajaxComplete(...) is for registering a handler
[14:00:04] <YellowShadow> even if I take that out it still doesn't work
[14:00:10] <shoky> don't call that on each actual complete
[14:00:20] <YellowShadow> It just directly goes to the else statement and does everything under that
[14:00:23] <shoky> i dont know how your code looks if you take it out.
[14:00:34] <shoky> if you want me to look at other code, paste it
[14:01:10] <YellowShadow> shoky: http://pastebin.com/hP2KVKAd
[14:01:44] <jrockjiggz> johnkpaul: i would like to have a background process running to receive push notifications from the website, and to have the app tie into the native notfication system.. I'm new to all this, so i any direction would help.. so far i've found: Application Craft (http://www.applicationcraft.com/), Any Presence (http://www.anypresence.com/)  or  Marmalade (http://www.madewithmarmalade.com/).  Some of these use HTML
[14:01:45] <shoky> if your ajax request is successful, and if msg == 'BUS_OK' , then that block of code WILL run
[14:02:04] <YellowShadow> But it doesn't...if I go alert(msg) it shows BUS_OK...
[14:02:29] <shoky> why is your dataType html ?
[14:02:42] <YellowShadow> I took that out too
[14:03:07] <shoky> do:  alert( msg == 'BUS_OK' )
[14:03:24] <YellowShadow> Under the if (msg == "BUS_OK")?
[14:03:25] <YellowShadow> or above it
[14:03:40] <bartmax> shoky: is there a jqueryui team on irc? which chann ? i want to extend datepicker to get custom tooltips on days.
[14:04:05] <shoky> bartmax: this is the official support channel for jqui..
[14:04:21] <bartmax> ok, let me rephrase then :D
[14:04:29] <bartmax> i want to extend datepicker to get custom tooltips on days. is that possible?
[14:04:47] <shoky> i donno ask the jqueryui team :D
[14:05:05] <YellowShadow> shoky: it came up false
[14:05:06] <shoky> it's probably possible, anyways
[14:05:13] <shoky> YellowShadow: then its false
[14:05:47] <YellowShadow> How come alert(msg) shows BUS_OK?
[14:05:58] <shoky> do console.log(msg)
[14:06:05] <shoky> dont use alerts. ever.
[14:07:16] <johnkpaul> jrockjiggz: have you looked into phonegap?
[14:07:23] <sadtaco> Okay. This makes even less sense "Unsafe JavaScript attempt to access frame with URL http://chat.example.com/ from frame with URL http://chat.example.com/messenger/messengeriframe.html. Domains, protocols and ports must match."
[14:07:40] <johnkpaul> I need to head out, but you should check out #phonegap and ask there
[14:07:42] <YellowShadow> shoky: still shows bus_ok
[14:07:56] <shoky> what does it show exactly?
[14:08:04] <YellowShadow> skips a line
[14:08:06] <YellowShadow> then bus_ok
[14:08:14] <shoky> lowercase.. ?
[14:08:18] <YellowShadow> no upper
[14:08:19] <shoky> no quotes around it ?
[14:08:26] <shoky> jesus.
[14:08:31] <shoky> i said 'exactly'
[14:08:53] <YellowShadow> Nope no quotes
[14:09:00] <YellowShadow> Just a skipped line and then BUS_OK
[14:09:13] <shoky> well maybe the skipping a line is a newline in your string, i donno
[14:09:24] <bartmax> jqueryui teaaammmm :D i want to extend datepicker to get custom tooltips on days. is that possible?
[14:09:34] <YellowShadow> But in my PHP code all it is, is print "BUS_OK"
[14:09:41] <YellowShadow> after the database insert is successful
[14:10:14] <cybuch> shoky, are u bored?
[14:10:23] <shoky> so so
[14:10:30] <shoky> got stuff i should be doing :\
[14:10:47] <cybuch> ok
[14:10:53] <cybuch> so i won't disturb then ; )
[14:10:55] <shoky> YellowShadow: what browser
[14:11:05] <sadtaco> http://pastebin.com/U6MmTWT4 It is on this line of code
[14:11:10] <shoky> cybuch: im not doing that stuff i should be doing though ;)
[14:11:28] <YellowShadow> shoky: Chrome... here is my PHP code http://pastebin.com/Kpfv3ECF
[14:11:53] <cybuch> shoky: if you want to glance at http://ajks.pl/Miernik/index.html again.... look into the code, especially the commented out part.
[14:12:21] <shoky> YellowShadow: chrome shows me quotes around strings in the console...
[14:12:23] <cybuch> shoky: how to set jplayer's mp3 from json array by clickin on div #up or #down?
[14:13:00] <YellowShadow> shoky: hmm.....working on linux wouldn't make a difference correct?
[14:13:11] <shoky> YellowShadow: unlikely
[14:13:28] <YellowShadow> Let me try on Windows
[14:13:32] <shoky> YellowShadow:
[14:13:33] <shoky> er
[14:13:49] <shoky> YellowShadow:  do  console.log( '[' + msg + ']' )  :\
[14:15:03] <YellowShadow> It shows [ on one line and then BUS_OK ] on the other
[14:15:36] <shoky> cybuch:  definitely not with eval()
[14:15:47] <shoky> YellowShadow: there you go then
[14:16:09] <YellowShadow> shoky: its creating a new line?
[14:16:14] <cybuch> shoky: I guess so, it's just the code that I pasted from w3schools and that I'm going to rewrite
[14:16:23] <shoky> your php is, probably, yes
[14:16:37] <shoky> cybuch: never go to w3schools.com
[14:16:46] <cybuch> why?
[14:16:46] <shoky> cybuch: and DEFINITELY dont copy paste code from there
[14:16:53] <shoky> cybuch: see www.w3fools.com
[14:16:56] <YellowShadow> but my php is print "BUS_OK"
[14:17:02] <YellowShadow> Where would it be creating a new line?
[14:17:23] <shoky> YellowShadow: print "BUS_OK" was not the only code in your php.
[14:17:50] <cybuch> I've printed 60 pages of js tutorial from there ;_;
[14:17:57] <LondonGuy> Any body know any jquery open graph protocol parser plugins?
[14:18:11] <shoky> i dont know dude. but look in chrome network tab and check what your ajax response looks like there, to make sure the newline really came from the PHP
[14:18:12] <YellowShadow> shoky: Are you talking about the if (db->affected())?
[14:18:15] <shoky> ^^ @ YellowShadow
[14:18:21] <shoky> yeahj
[14:18:32] <shoky> and if you have $db->affected then i guess you have more code before that..
[14:19:04] <shoky> cybuch: then you dont have to buy toilet paper for a while
[14:19:29] <cybuch> shoky: I know - I've read it ;/
[14:19:33] <shoky> ;<
[14:20:33] <YellowShadow> shoky: the network tab shows the new line as well
[14:20:39] <YellowShadow> how cna i check if it was form the php?
[14:20:40] <YellowShadow> from*
[14:21:12] <shoky> if the network tab shows it
[14:21:14] <shoky> then it's from the php
[14:21:20] <shoky> im pretty sure..
[14:21:36] <shoky> php or something else server-side anyway
[14:22:15] <YellowShadow> There is no other Print call in that php function
[14:22:39] <YellowShadow> I use the same concept else where on the site and it works fine
[14:23:37] <shoky> no idea..
[14:23:51] <YellowShadow> Alright thanks for your help sir
[14:23:54] <shoky> np
[14:25:28] <bartmax> shoky: first try: http://jsfiddle.net/Fv4q6/
[14:25:29] <bartmax> not bad :D
[14:26:35] <shoky> cybuch: something like- $('#up').click( function() {  currentIndex = ...;  $('#elo').jPlayer('setMedia', { mp3: txt.songs[ currentIndex ].Name } ); } )
[14:27:14] <nonotza> I have such a headache right now trying to debug this darn thing. hope someone can help.
[14:27:19] <shoky> bartmax nice. where did you find  $.ui.datepicker.hoverCallback  ?
[14:27:23] <nonotza> basically I have this http://jsfiddle.net/GCrW5/1/
[14:27:30] <nonotza> and that works in the fiddle
[14:27:48] <shoky> oh nvm
[14:27:54] <cybuch> shoky: thanks. and currentIndex should be '...' ?
[14:27:56] <nonotza> but in the context of my code it returns an empty object string: eg. []
[14:28:08] <shoky> cybuch:  no that's for you to fill out.......
[14:28:24] <cybuch> shoky: :D sure
[14:28:30] <shoky> ;)
[14:28:31] <nonotza> I can't seem to get jquery to find the form because if I do $('#video_form').attr('id') this also returns null
[14:28:57] <shoky> cybuch: and of course that's assuming you declare var currentIndex = 0;  somewhere.. or smth
[14:29:18] <nonotza> I'm confused why the form#id isn't being identified by jquery
[14:29:51] <nonotza> the js console isn't returning any errors either
[14:30:24] <bartmax> shoky: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui/source/browse/branches/labs/datepicker2/demos/datepicker/?r=3875
[14:30:37] <bartmax> shoky: that's the official source code of jqueryui ?
[14:31:07] <shoky> well the 'labs' seems to hint no
[14:31:17] <bartmax> uh
[14:31:27] <shoky> fuckkk chrome dev is fucking up so much
[14:31:33] <shoky> maybe ill switch back to beta ;(
[14:32:27] <shoky> bartmax: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui
[14:32:41] <sven_oostenbrink> I do a $.get('file.html').success(alert('a')).error(alert('b')); and well, I get "b"... Checking the jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown variables: textStatus is "error", errorThrown is empty, and jqXHR is not of much help either.. The only thing I have found is that .state() is "rejected".. The file is a valid HTML file (Even just made it <div>test</div>).. What could be the problem?
[14:33:34] <cybuch> shoky: something must be missin there, its not workin though
[14:33:35] <shoky> nonotza:  what does console.log( $('#video_form') )  say ?
[14:33:41] <donkeycongo> Does ready() work with delegate?
[14:34:49] <nonotza> let me check shoky - thanks
[14:34:50] <shoky> cybuch: first of all, move ALL that code that's in the big <script> tag inside  the $(function() {  .............. } )  that you have above,
[14:35:05] <shoky> cybuch: together with the $('.knob').knob(....
[14:35:53] <cybuch> shoky: done :d
[14:35:56] <nonotza> shoky: console.log($('#video_form')) returns: []
[14:36:06] <bartmax> shoky: nothing about hoveronday on that repo :(
[14:37:32] <donkeycongo> How do I make a callback for when an element is inserted/loaded?
[14:38:38] <silverwind> You can't without using bleeding edges API that are not available in most browsers.
[14:38:57] <donkeycongo> All right. Thanks.
[14:41:08] <shoky> cybuch: http://pastebin.com/CaTUFur0
[14:43:45] <rodd> Guess I should use deferred in this case, or is it the while loop's fault? http://jsfiddle.net/zzzrod/Dp9UY/
[14:45:15] <shoky> why the .toArray
[14:46:10] <rodd> to simulate the real code
[14:46:19] <rodd> where I have an array, not a jquery sel
[14:46:55] <shoky> rodd: http://jsfiddle.net/Dp9UY/2/
[14:47:19] <rodd> hm each
[14:48:25] <rodd> shoky, thanks, let me try in the real code
[14:49:53] <cybuch> shoky: *brofist*
[14:50:00] <cybuch> is there i can do in return for u?
[14:50:11] <shoky> ;>
[14:50:21] <shoky> i donno, is there ;P
[14:50:56] <cybuch> shoky: tell me anything I could do ; D
[14:51:23] <shoky> i donno what you can do :D
[14:51:36] <rodd> shoky, thanks $.each did it
[14:51:43] <shoky> np rodd
[14:51:44] <rodd> been beating on this for hours with diff loops
[14:51:54] <rodd> gotta check $.each source code
[14:51:58] <rodd> to see what ive been missing
[14:52:09] <shoky> it's mostly just a for loop
[14:52:17] <shoky> calling your callback
[14:52:25] <shoky> as you'd expect ;P
[14:52:32] <rodd> i think declaring the var outside the loop was the key
[14:52:39] <rodd> the issue, that is
[14:53:01] <shoky> yea i didnt really even check what your issue was but that makes sense
[14:53:17] <cybuch> shoky: I know what!!!
[14:53:31] <shoky> !
[14:54:30] <cybuch> shoky: ye, more exclamation marks ; ) what's time at ur place/

[14:59:18] <cybuch> shoky: I'm fan of diet/sports n shit, so I can give u some nice recipes
[15:00:47] <sven_oostenbrink> Any idea why a $.get would cause an error with.. well, not really anything?  textStatus is "error", errorThrown is an empty string, and thats all
[15:00:59] <sven_oostenbrink> ah, jqXHR.state() gives me "rejected"
[15:01:14] <sven_oostenbrink> In detail.. I do a $.get('file.html').success(alert('a')).error(alert('b')); and well, I get "b"... Checking the jqXHR, textStatus, errorThrown variables: textStatus is "error", errorThrown is empty, and jqXHR is not of much help either.. The only thing I have found is that .state() is "rejected".. The file is a valid HTML file (Even just made it <div>test</div>).. What could be the problem?
[15:02:03] <cybuch> shoky: http://foty.tk/images/hztcqimgur.jpg those are basics, but yummy

[15:29:39] <donkeycongo> Is there a way to make jQuery not overwrite "this" in eventhandlers?
[15:31:09] <shoky> donkeycongo: dont think so
[15:31:27] <donkeycongo> Shite
[15:31:32] <shoky> why shite
[15:33:08] <donkeycongo> Cause Im making classes with methods as eventHandlers, and this forces me to assign "this" in the object context to another var. Making it less pretty.
[15:39:30] <antnash> Evening shoky. Just a quick question about best practice. Am I right in thinking that if I'm creating a site for the masses I should design it completely without js first, then enhance?
[15:39:40] <upmauro> how i bind event for change in all selects elements ? .. i try jQuery(':selected').change(function() ... but does not work
[15:40:15] <donkeycongo> antnash: What's the point?
[15:40:18] <shoky> antnash: I dunno..
[15:40:31] <antnash> upmauro: How about $(document).on('change', ':selected', function() { });
[15:41:08] <upmauro> ty
[15:41:42] <antnash> upmauro: if you do (':selected').change(function() {  }); it only binds to those that are currently selected.
[15:42:14] <antnash> Well I was thinking about people that, for some reason, would have js disabled.
[15:42:57] <shoky> yea if you care about them then you shouldn't have your design be based on JS doing stuff
[15:43:19] <antnash> Is it not best practice to account for as many as possible?
[15:43:20] <shoky> well. i dunno. im not the person to ask about that prolly
[15:43:24] <donkeycongo> antnash: Why even bother with those? You dont optimize your site for IE5 either, I suppose.
[15:44:14] <antnash> donkeycongo: I know it's not gonna be many, but every one means someone that won't return.
[15:49:03] <shoky> donkeycongo: maybe this helps?  http://jsfiddle.net/8JUGw/
[15:49:37] <shoky> donkeycongo: (obviously that realHandler is not really needed if you have the 'self' in scope)
[15:52:15] <shoky> donkeycongo: oh sorry that's exactly what you said you dont wanna do ;D
[15:52:19] <donkeycongo> ^^
[15:52:58] <fairlynew> I have possible bug report but I'd like to pose the info here first if anyone out there would like to review the info?
[15:54:17] <shoky> fairlynew: go ahead.. a demo on jsfiddle.net would be best though
[15:56:18] <fairlynew> I'll start by saying this only seems to be a problem with IE8
[15:56:26] <fairlynew> <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8" src="https://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.7.2.min.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript" charset="utf-8">     $(document).ready(function()     {         $("*").removeAttr("align", "");      }     ); </script>​
[15:56:57] <fairlynew> this crashes using jquery 1.6.3 and up
[15:57:04] <shoky> donkeycongo you can also do: http://jsfiddle.net/8JUGw/1/
[15:57:24] <pmbbb> Hi! I need some help with getJSON - data just won't show up. Anyone want to take a look on some short code? :)
[15:57:51] <shoky> fairlynew: www.jsfiddle.net
[15:58:16] <shoky> pmbbb:  paste it in a pastebin and ask..
[15:58:50] <fairlynew> http://jsfiddle.net/zwYDK/1/
[15:59:07] <shoky> umm why are you calling removeAttr with 2 arguments?
[15:59:08] <pmbbb> Sure! http://jsfiddle.net/VZNwQ/ - any idea why it wont retrieve the data?
[15:59:58] <donkeycongo> shoky: Im not sure exactly what is happening there.
[16:00:25] <shoky> donkeycongo: you know .bind ?
[16:00:38] <shoky> donkeycongo: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind
[16:01:35] <shoky> pmbbb: jquery 1.3.0  , really?
[16:02:10] <fairlynew> this was someone else code, Im working on top of
[16:02:12] <shoky> pmbbb: also you have two nested document ready handlers :S
[16:02:15] <pmbbb> Used a tutorial, didn't really notice :o)
[16:02:36] <shoky> fairlynew: removeAttr has only one argument
[16:03:41] <shoky> pmbbb: and you're also returning false from one of them.. huh?
[16:03:54] <fairlynew> I get the same problem when only using one argument
[16:05:14] <fairlynew> oh, do you think a check for this attribute first would help?  :)
[16:07:05] <shoky> it's not crashing for me
[16:07:57] <shoky> anyway why the hell would you do that :\
[16:09:55] <donkeycongo> shoky: That works. Still a little confused about .bind(). Gonna take a look at it later. Thank you.
[16:16:09] <shoky> donkeycongo: in this case just think of .bind as creating a new function whose context ('this') is the first argument you give it
[16:16:28] <shoky> and returning that new function
[16:18:04] <donkeycongo> shoky: Ye. Just confused me, because Im already calling it from the context Im re-binding(?) it to. this.method.bind(this)
[16:20:13] <donkeycongo> shoky: It might be causing another problem though. In "o" I have a property that is a file-input-element($("#file-input")), and it now doesnt recognize that a file has been selected (o.file_input.files[0]). What could cause this?
[16:21:34] <shoky> mmm i can't really say..
[16:22:57] <fairlynew> got it with if ($("*").attr("align")){ $("*").removeAttr("align"); }
[16:23:01] <fairlynew> Thanks
[16:23:16] <shoky> uhh
[16:23:20] <shoky> that doesn't look right at all
[16:24:04] <shoky> so much in fact, that it's wrong
[16:24:20] <shoky> @ fairlynew
[16:26:12] <fairlynew> woops
[16:26:21] <fairlynew> howabout this
[16:26:25] <fairlynew> if($("*").attr("align")!== undefined){ $("*").removeAttr("align"); }
[16:26:47] <shoky> why are you using $("*")  in the first place ?
[16:27:10] <shoky> and no that is still wrong, because .attr only works on the first element in the set
[16:27:19] <shoky> while .removeAttr works on the whole set
[16:28:16] <fairlynew> this is someone else script on alot of old pages that seem to be problematice with clearing this
[16:28:38] <donkeycongo> shoky: When I display this.file_input in the console, it shows the actual element. Isnt it supposed to be some object?
[16:28:39] <shoky> i'd suggest removing it will fix the problem.
[16:29:07] <shoky> donkeycongo: i dunno.. depends what you put there
[16:29:16] <donkeycongo> $("#file-input")
[16:29:28] <fairlynew> although it possible it doesnt even work, Id just like to get some sort of solution in place that doesnt come back to bite me like, "why do you remove this code?"
[16:29:36] <shoky> it shows  [<the element>...</the element>] ?
[16:29:46] <donkeycongo> ye
[16:29:59] <shoky> that's what you put there.. its fine. no?
[16:30:27] <shoky> that's how a jquery object looks in the console
[16:30:32] <shoky> it's a collection of elements
[16:30:32] <donkeycongo> Oh, ok.
[16:30:38] <shoky> sort of
[16:30:54] <donkeycongo> Weird.
[16:31:22] <shoky> jquery objects masquerade as arrays
[16:31:58] <shoky> if it just showed you the object itself in the console that would be annoying
[16:32:06] <donkeycongo> Do I need to reload it or something?
[16:32:20] <shoky> mmm reload what? for what?
[16:32:52] <donkeycongo> It is defined when the object is created. The method is then called when the file input changes. But it's not getting the file that is selected.
[16:33:23] <shoky> what isn't getting the file?
[16:34:11] <shoky> brb vbox update wants to reset my network connections
[16:36:28] <shoky> helo
[16:37:09] <donkeycongo> shoky: $("#file-input").change(function(){this.files[0];}); works
[16:37:21] <donkeycongo> shoky: $("#file-input").change(function(){$("#file-input").files[0];}); does not
[16:37:42] <shoky> oh
[16:37:57] <shoky> $("#file-input")[0].files[0]
[16:38:19] <shoky> the first [0] is to get the actual DOM element that is wrapped in the jq object
[16:39:12] <donkeycongo> yay
[16:39:24] <shoky> ;]
[16:40:18] <donkeycongo> Thanks, shoky.
[16:40:27] <shoky> no probbie
[16:50:32] <fairlynew> thanks, bye
[16:56:13] <vandunk> Hi. I'm currently using some jquery based off this: http://jsfiddle.net/9Amdx/7/  although the scroll animations/easing last longer. At the moment you can scroll straight from the top to the bottom div, but I want to be able to only scroll to the next div down (i.e. wait for the animation to finish before scrolling to the next div). Can anyone suggest a way to do this?
[17:03:37] <Ukto> hey guys, if I have a scrolling div, is there any easy way to set an area of the scroll that should be centered in the display
[18:43:08] <jrockjiggz> I have a bunch of links, (styled as tabs) that wrap onto a second line.  I want to make it that the 'active' tab gets pushed down  to the bottom most wrapped line to be flush with the content.  I also dont want to mess up the order of the links, so i want to emulate how windows does it, by keeping the tabs on each rows together, and flipping the rows.  the problem is this needs to be dynamic, i dont know how bi
[18:43:27] <diverdude> Hello, is .live() deprecated?
[18:43:28] <Mac_Weber> why this http://jsfiddle.net/SByMJ/ does not work when using "ready" or "load"?
[18:43:31] <Eviltwin> diverdude: Yes
[18:43:41] <diverdude> Eviltwin: what is used instead?
[18:43:47] <jrockjiggz> on
[18:44:19] <Eviltwin> Mac_Weber: Ready is a top-level event, it can't be applied to elements
[18:44:39] <Eviltwin> And "load" when applied to elements means like network loading
[18:44:41] <Eviltwin> Like with images and iframes
[18:44:51] <Eviltwin> It makes no sense to listen to a load event on a DIV
[18:46:00] <Mac_Weber> Eviltwin: This div is being created using ajax. How to get its height as soon as it is created and text is inserted there?
[18:46:27] <Eviltwin> In your AJAX, after you insert it, run your height code
[18:46:54] <eip56> .height()
[18:50:35] <jrockjiggz> api.jquery.com is down?
[18:54:31] <eip56> Down for me as well as http://www.downforeveryoneorjustme.com/api.jquery.com/
[18:55:46] <diverdude> Eviltwin: hmmm isn't this correct? $(".draftchoice").on("click",function(){console.log("hello")}); ?
[18:56:43] <diverdude> Eviltwin: and when i add the class: li = $("<li></li>").addClass("draftchoice");
[18:57:35] <diverdude> Eviltwin: but nothing happens when i click
[18:58:17] <shoky> diverdude:  what you did is same as .click(...)
[18:58:40] <diverdude> shoky: how should i then do?
[18:58:57] <shoky> diverdude:  you need something more like:  $('#someContainerElement').on('click', '.draftchoice', function() { .... } )
[18:59:13] <shoky> if you want to emulate .live exactly then that container element is just 'document'
[18:59:44] <shoky> e.g. $(document).on
[18:59:57] <Eviltwin> diverdude: Also please read the API pages for these things
[19:00:05] <diverdude> shoky: but what is '#someContainerElement' ? the class can be added to different containers
[19:00:13] <diverdude> Eviltwin: api is down
[19:00:37] <Eviltwin> When it;s up
[19:00:39] <Eviltwin> it's*
[19:00:41] <shoky> diverdude: either a container element (that maybe holds all of those different containers you mentioned), or just 'body' or document
[19:01:10] <diverdude> shoky: hmm why not always use document then?
[19:01:53] <Eviltwin> Two reasons
[19:02:23] <Eviltwin> Let's say you have a mousemove listener
[19:02:38] <Eviltwin> If you use the document, it's going to check every time you move the mouse
[19:02:44] <Eviltwin> "Did this match the selector?"
[19:03:16] <Eviltwin> Which is a lot of overhead if you're only interested in movements in a smaller container
[19:03:51] <Eviltwin> 2) Sometimes you actually want the static binding
[19:03:52] <diverdude> Eviltwin: hmm okay...so i need to find the "largest" common element for those elements that may possible have the class which should trigger the event?
[19:04:18] <Eviltwin> You should find the closest ancestor of the element that you can
[19:04:27] <Eviltwin> That still suits your needs
[19:05:19] <diverdude> ok
[19:05:22] <shoky> if you have some containers that all have a common class you could also:  $('.containerClass').on('click', '.draftchoice', ... )
[19:05:34] <shirt> i have a problem with QUnit. my test checks that an element is focused at the appropriate time. this works when i run the test directly in the browser. but if i run the test using a remote connection to the browser then the test fails because the firefox browser window doesn't have focus and so the tested element doesn't have focus
[19:05:37] <shoky> but that'd work a bit differently
[19:06:33] <shoky> as if you called .on(... for each of those containers seperately with the same handler
[19:07:16] <diverdude> Eviltwin: and the ancestor is not allowed to be added to the DOM after i do the $("#ancestor").on(...) right?
[19:07:30] <Eviltwin> Do you know what $("[selector here]") does?
[19:07:56] <Eviltwin> When you type that in jQuery, what actually happens
[19:08:38] <K3|Chris> selects an element?
[19:08:52] <Eviltwin> I'm asking diverdude
[19:09:02] <scathen^C> hey all, i am trying to implement a paste event (so users can paste into an object on the page), but everywhere i look people mention security red flags. i don't understand why.
[19:09:03] <diverdude> Eviltwin: selects an element
[19:09:21] <Eviltwin> Okay, how?
[19:09:26] <shoky> diverdude: btw, http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://api.jquery.com/on
[19:09:31] <Eviltwin> (At a high level)
[19:09:38] <K3|Chris> shoky: site down?
[19:09:41] <shoky> yap
[19:09:42] <diverdude> Eviltwin: using getElementbyId i suppose
[19:09:57] <Eviltwin> In the case of $("#id") yes
[19:10:29] <shoky> not just any getElementById..   document.getElementById
[19:10:30] <Eviltwin> So what happens if you do document.getElementById("doesntexist")
[19:10:37] <diverdude> Eviltwin: getElementByClass in case of class ?
[19:10:49] <Eviltwin> Where there's  no element with ID doesntexist
[19:12:02] <Eviltwin> What gets returned from document.getElementById?
[19:12:05] <diverdude> ok, thx
[19:12:19] <Eviltwin> It returns null
[19:12:35] <Eviltwin> And jQuery (in a sense) returns a dressed up array of elements that matched
[19:12:42] <Eviltwin> And nothing matched
[19:12:46] <Eviltwin> So you basically have an empty array
[19:12:50] <Eviltwin> Then when you call .on
[19:12:59] <Eviltwin> It attaches a listener to everything in that array
[19:13:04] <Eviltwin> Which is still going to be empty
[19:14:06] <shoky> well if one was used to .live
[19:14:20] <shoky> then the whole getElementById argument isn't as valid ;P
[19:14:43] <Eviltwin> Well
[19:14:54] <Eviltwin> A getElementById still happened :P
[19:15:00] <shoky> :)
[19:35:24] <heoa> what was the command for movement?
[19:47:20] <donkeycongo> heoa: "Move!"
[19:55:19] <shoky> giddyup
[20:00:56] <heoa> animate, solved.

[21:08:09] <shoky> Berniee you could try to explain your problem better..
[21:08:31] <Berniee> Sorry
[21:08:45] <Berniee> to the best of my poor knowledge this is what i know
[21:09:09] <shoky>  <Berniee> am trying to select a gmarkers[x]
[21:09:14] <shoky> <Berniee> x being the markerid  of  SearchName
[21:09:18] <shoky> lets start with
[21:09:20] <Berniee> when a user enters a name into a search input
[21:09:39] <shoky> what is gmarkers? what do you mean select a gmarkers[x] ? what is a markerid, what is SearchName
[21:10:15] <Berniee> a xml file is accessed via jquery to autocomplete the search input with the id of searchName
[21:10:41] <shoky> 4 questions. 1 answer
[21:10:48] <shoky> common sense, Berniee
[21:11:03] <shoky> no one will help you if you cant explain your problem properly
[21:11:05] <Berniee> sorry its really late and am pretty lost
[21:11:15] <Berniee> 1 sec
[21:11:19] <Berniee> am trying to think in order logically
[21:11:21] <tw2113> i'd say go take a long nap and come back when rested
[21:11:25] <Berniee> after they enter a name
[21:11:36] <Berniee> they can select one from the autocomplete
[21:11:44] <Berniee> which is set as searchName
[21:11:49] <Berniee> the user sends the form
[21:12:02] <Berniee> which calls the testResults() function
[21:12:12] <Berniee> and gets the searchName
[21:12:17] <tw2113> so you want autocomplete that is provided by xml, and a callback on submit?
[21:12:17] <Berniee> and
[21:12:31] <Berniee> i want it to load the related marker
[21:12:35] <tw2113> with the callback using form data
[21:12:42] <Berniee> www.highaccess.nl/maps2.php
[21:12:44] <shoky> Berniee: what is a marker?
[21:12:47] <Berniee> that is my working example
[21:12:57] <Berniee> gmarkers array
[21:13:15] <Berniee> within the testResults() function
[21:13:19] <shoky> yes
[21:13:23] <shoky> what is gmarkers array
[21:13:46] <Berniee> its an array of markers :s sorry i dont know what u mean
[21:14:00] <Berniee> with title, lng, lat, address, markerid
[21:14:04] <Berniee> from the xml file
[21:14:27] <Berniee> so it autocompletes using data from the xml file, the title
[21:14:34] <Berniee> i want it to also select the markerid
[21:14:37] <tw2113> so you want to provide a form for people to submit data into, and then take that data, and create a map from the location or whatever, with nearby locations
[21:15:09] <tw2113> *gives up trying to explain other people*
[21:15:09] <Berniee> they search
[21:15:21] <Berniee> sorry am not skilled at this
[21:15:35] <tw2113> people somehow vote for Mitt Romney, you can't explain that
[21:15:47] <Berniee> change
[21:15:53] <Berniee> hope
[21:16:00] <Berniee> am not from usa
[21:16:08] <Berniee> that politics is out of my scope
[21:16:20] <tw2113> neither is shoky
[21:16:25] <tw2113> but i trust he's actually sane
[21:16:26] <Berniee> am europe
[21:16:35] <Berniee> based
[21:16:44] <Berniee> yes i want them to enter a name
[21:16:48] <shoky> Berniee: it seems like you're getting the xml twice?
[21:16:55] <Berniee> and it finds the name and markerid
[21:16:55] <shoky> both in MYMAP.placeMarkers('london.xml');
[21:17:02] <shoky> and with  $.ajax({
[21:17:10] <Berniee> so i can use the marker id for this :  	  google.maps.event.trigger(gmarkers[3], "click");
[21:17:32] <Berniee> where 3 is the corresponding markerid / searchName number
[21:18:07] <Berniee> searchName selects from the <title> element, i also want the <markerid> to be selected so i can use that number
[21:18:16] <Berniee> pls tell me this makes sense
[21:18:29] <denysonique> How many % of this channel uses CoffeeScript?
[21:18:42] <denysonique> I would like to hear your opinnion
[21:18:45] <denysonique> about CS/JS
[21:18:47] <psyolus> Is it possible to specify the protocol, host, and URI separately for jQuery.ajax?
[21:18:48] <denysonique> I use both
[21:18:55] <denysonique> s/use/use and like/
[21:18:57] <Berniee> shoky?
[21:19:12] <Berniee> anyone :(
[21:19:25] <denysonique> psyolus: it only accepts the URI, you can build it and then give it to $.ajax
[21:19:28] <Berniee> i was using a assoc array
[21:19:37] <psyolus> Bah
[21:19:44] <Berniee> to searchName was  used like this: gmarkers[searchName]
[21:19:52] <Berniee> but i am not using numeric,
[21:20:22] <jrockjiggz> When i use wrapAll() it strips the whitespace between my elements.. i can correct this with css, but sometimes i dont use wrapAll() and unless i make my source have all elements on one line, i can't have a linebreak between elements
[21:20:39] <jrockjiggz> the el is <a>
[21:20:49] <Berniee> damn
[21:21:59] <palesh> hi guys
[21:22:31] <Berniee> this aint a place for noobs is it?
[21:25:47] <balazs> Berniee: it totally is.
[21:26:50] <Berniee> am not having much luck
[21:26:55] <Berniee> nearly 5.30am
[21:27:20] <Berniee> gonna have to call it a nite soon :(
[21:27:27] <balazs> it's late everywhere :)
[21:27:27] <Berniee> another wasted day
[21:27:37] <balazs> sleep is good
[21:27:42] <Berniee> be easier to hire someone
[21:27:52] <Berniee> but no one appears to be interested
[21:28:28] <balazs> this you send a link to your code ?
[21:28:45] <balazs> I didn't see a clear question from you
[21:29:16] <Berniee> its not clear i know
[21:29:20] <Berniee> i think i narrowed it down
[21:29:43] <Berniee> its because i swapped from assoc to numeric array
[21:29:50] <Berniee> and was using string to index array
[21:29:55] <Berniee> now i can not
[21:30:20] <Berniee> so i need to some how get the markerid which selects the array index
[21:30:33] <Berniee> but the user inputs a name
[21:30:46] <balazs> did you show any code ?
[21:30:56] <Berniee> www.highaccess.nl/maps2.php
[21:31:28] <Berniee> it is a non profit site for smokers
[21:31:35] <Berniee> we dont sell anything
[21:31:48] <Berniee> just info, many people ask me for something
[21:31:58] <Berniee> its not that kind of site
[21:32:34] <Berniee> ive been trying to add a hidden field to somehow select markerid depending on which name they choose
[21:32:58] <Berniee> i cant find it in the dom even
[21:34:42] <Berniee> if you could select all the marker values of the selected shop
[21:34:56] <Berniee> so i can use them
[21:35:07] <Berniee> not just the title
[21:35:22] <Berniee> i can set the numeric array index to the corresponding shop
[21:35:52] <Berniee> bollocks
[21:36:00] <Berniee> like a ghost town this place
[21:41:59] <Raziel_> hey, anyone reading?
[21:42:47] <SCIF> Good time of day!
[21:43:01] <Raziel_> hey SCIF
[21:43:13] <SCIF> I have a noob question.
[21:43:39] <Raziel_> I can't connect to jQuery's core documentation web page? does anyone knows what happens?
[21:43:40] <SCIF> I have form markup on page. How i can post this form by ajax?
[21:43:57] <SCIF> Raziel, same result about api.jquery.com
[21:44:30] <Raziel_> Yeah,... but you are lucky, im using google cache, and I'm doing the same you need to do
[21:44:32] <Raziel_> using ajax
[21:44:53] <Berniee> well am fucked
[21:45:04] <Berniee> thanks for chatting ,
[21:45:06] <Raziel_> I have some experience using ajax without jQuery, cause i like to code without libraries.. :)
[21:45:35] <Berniee> adios
[21:45:47] <SCIF> How? I must put in ajax key-value pairs, but it's just in input fields. Am i must iterate all input and get their name=>valuer pairs?
[21:46:29] <Raziel_> are you going to use jQuery to send the form data?
[21:46:56] <Raziel_> if that's the case use the $.post() function, is really easy
[21:47:00] <SCIF> Yeah. I want to use jquery
[21:47:21] <Raziel_> look here's an snippet of code i just copied from the documentation
[21:47:22] <Raziel_> $.post("test.php", $("#testform").serialize());
[21:47:41] <SCIF> O!! Great
[21:47:45] <SCIF> I'll test it now
[21:47:50] <Raziel_> to serialize the info contained in the form us that function...
[21:48:08] <Raziel_> glad I was able to help you
[21:48:22] <Raziel_> Try, then tell me if it worked...
[21:49:03] <Raziel_> heres the cache documentation about de $.post() function
[21:49:16] <Raziel_> http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/
[21:51:34] <SCIF> Hmmm. But serialize implode data into key=val&key2=val2... But post() get array
[21:53:59] <SCIF> Raziel_, i use http://remysharp.com/jquery-api/ to view api of jquery
[21:54:19] <SCIF> Raziel_, did you see my last mesage?
[21:54:31] <Raziel_> yes... I did,..
[21:55:15] <Raziel_> so did it worked? the serialize function sent the data with a wrong format?
[21:56:14] <SCIF> I didn't try but format is another
[21:56:33] <Raziel_> Dont worry, look, the doc says, the next
[21:56:56] <Raziel_> $.post function is a shortcut to the $.ajax function
[21:57:27] <Raziel_> the $.ajax function can handle either mapped data or an string with the right format
[21:57:48] <SCIF> Hmm. I'll try it now
[21:58:01] <rabbi1> i am working on ui tabs with validations, and with single form element, for all tabs. can anybody suggest me good example link ?
[21:58:09] <Raziel_> Just give it a try, and let me know
[22:01:19] <SCIF> Raziel_, you was right :) Thanks a lot :) I am just php backend programmer, but want to learn jquery and do with it some stuff
[22:01:45] <Raziel_> I'm the same, just a kinda noob php backend programmer
[22:02:23] <Raziel_> but in this web page im making, they told me to use jQuery, so i guess it's a good time to learn... :)
[22:31:21] <rabbi1> i am working on ui tabs with validations, and with single form element, for all tabs. can anybody suggest me good example link ?
[22:35:14] <Ziber> If I have JQuery code in an include JS file, do I need to encase it in $(document).ready(function() { }); in that file?
[22:45:27] <donkeycongo> No, Ziber.
[22:47:18] <rabbi1> donkeycongo: i am working on ui tabs with validations, and with single form element, for all tabs. any suggestion  ?
[22:47:56] <SCIF> rabbi1, what's trouble?
[22:48:09] <donkeycongo> rabbi1: I dont know what that means, so no.
[22:49:12] <Ziber> donkeycongo: Really? I'm very confused. I'm including two scripts, currently both encased in ready functions. Only one of them works. Any ideas? http://sandbox.liber.in/cr/manage.php
[22:49:34] <rabbi1> SCIF: I am using UI tabs and validate plugin, both are working. Now the every other tab depends on the previous input element to show, if the element required is not added then it should not trigger the next tab .... how can i do it ?
[22:54:01] <donkeycongo> Ziber: You bind elements from the header.
[22:54:16] <Ziber> Hm?
[22:54:35] <donkeycongo> $("#registerNetwork").click(...);
[22:54:44] <Ziber> Yeah, what about it?
[22:54:44] <donkeycongo> The body hasnt been loaded yet.
[22:55:03] <Ziber> So to fix that?
[22:55:31] <donkeycongo> Use .delegate() or $().ready()
[22:55:45] <Ziber> You told me I didn't need $(document).ready()
[22:56:26] <Ziber> Yeah, now it works. I found a typo after I had removed it, putting it back fixed it. Thanks.
[23:05:23] <rabbi1> SCIF: any ide ?
[23:07:11] <psyolus> Any recommendations for avoiding collisions with localstorage?
[23:11:34] <diverdude> ack i sure hope the jquery API will be up again soon
[23:13:39] <r500> how can i implement document.forms["frm_testimony"]["txtbox_name"].value using jquery? where "frm_testimony" is form name and "txtbox_name"  text box name
[23:26:45] <firedfox> $('form[name="frm_testimony"] input[name="txtbox_name"]).val()
[23:47:32] <psyolus> jquery.com down?
[23:47:51] <psyolus> Err... api.jquery.com
[23:50:05] <jrockjiggz2> is there a way to strip <ul> and keep the <LI>'s ?
[23:51:00] <tw2113> what's producing all of it jrockjiggz2 ?
[23:51:34] <tw2113> for now i assume they're coming from an external source
[23:55:07] <jrockjiggz2> tw2113: well no, i have a single UL list of LI's.  I need to break it into 2 (or more) lists, and wrap each one in a div.  I'm able to split it up and wrap it back up. but i'm left with the wrapped <ul>....</ul> elements..
[23:55:58] <jrockjiggz2> <ul><li>Item1</li><li>Item2</li></ul>    convert to ->    <div><ul><li>Item1</li></ul></div><div><ul><li>Item2</li></ul></div>
[23:57:02] <tw2113> hmm
