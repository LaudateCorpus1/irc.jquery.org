[00:17:47] <rasu> hello i use jquery to handle ajax requests. anybody knoes how to make the javscript waits until my ajax gets response from my php script? the php script is a big script that takes a few sec
[00:19:06] <Bauer> rasu what do you mean by 'wait'? perhaps you mean async: false
[00:21:06] <rasu> Bauer: i meen that i have a div that i want to show and when i get the response from my ajax i want to close it but i have a for loop to run this ajax many times. maby async will do it i shall read on it. thanks
[00:22:30] <Bauer> rasu: check out the success event which would be called upon successful ajax call (and fail event as well)
[00:23:12] <lonesoldier728> anyone here familiar with backbone js
[00:29:30] <rasu> Bauer I think it works with async thanks
[00:48:46] <lonesoldier728> should $("#es-search [type=submit]").show()
[00:48:50] <lonesoldier728> work on showing the button?
[01:15:45] <jgx> Hi
[01:16:15] <jgx> I'm trying to get the content returned by this address with the jquery AJAX method : http://adelb.univ-lyon1.fr/jsp/custom/modules/plannings/anonymous_cal.jsp?resources=16889&projectId=1&calType=ical&firstDate=2013-10-01&lastDate=2014-02-02
[01:16:47] <jgx> The address return a iCalendar file
[01:17:13] <jgx> I want to use ajax to get the content as plain text and then parse it with a js lib
[01:17:17] <jgx> But I can't get the content
[01:17:37] <jgx> I tried with the dataType: "text" but I've got nothing
[01:18:28] <jgx> So I also tried with "jsonp", then I have the content but there is a parse error as the file isn't formatted as JSON
[01:18:55] <jgx> So my question is, how can I force the jsonp request to not be parsed ?
[01:19:18] <jgx> or how can I get the content of the file returned by this url : http://adelb.univ-lyon1.fr/jsp/custom/modules/plannings/anonymous_cal.jsp?resources=16889&projectId=1&calType=ical&firstDate=2013-10-01&lastDate=2014-02-02 using AJAX ?
[01:19:23] <jgx> thanks for helping me :)
[01:19:57] <jgx> The call I try to make isn't on the same domain
[01:27:59] <jgx> NObody ?

[04:34:40] <arkascha> I have to code a settings dialog for a single page application.
[04:34:48] <arkascha> I feel like not using a standard dialog.

[04:40:28] <Paladine> hey peeps can anyone tell me how to reset the slider value to 5 each time a user closes the info panel and opens it again (either from the same or different cell) on this page http://www.privatebrowser.org/pb-new/privacy.php
[04:40:43] <Paladine> at the moment the slider value is retaining the last value set
[04:41:15] <Paladine> (you need to click on one of the coloured cells then click on send us feedback to find the slider in question)
[04:47:02] <Paladine> ok I got it, I just empty the modal panel's html on close
[04:47:13] <Paladine> so it is forced to rewrite it every time
[05:36:22] <rasu_> i have a for loop that calls an ajax function to resize 10pics/call in php. and i have a jquery-ui progressbar that i want to show how the progress is going. my thought was that i can update the progressbar every time i call a ajax and then use i / allimages * 100 to get the %. but when i tries to show this in progressbar i cant see the progressbar update. i think this is because my ajax is async:false and the browser dosent update img. anybody wh
[05:45:50] <Fr0n> cheers

[05:47:04] <Fr0n> Might somebody little time to help me with my mobile page (based on jq) ? :S
[05:59:57] <Vivekananda> hello everyone
[06:00:22] <Vivekananda> anyone around ? I am trying to build an example for myself using this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/2/
[06:00:50] <Vivekananda> currently there is something wrong with the variable definition but I am not able to figure out what
[06:18:59] <Fr0n> o.O
[06:19:11] <Fr0n> http://akcay.hdpk-studienserver.de/php/
[06:19:17] <Fr0n> what i do wrong with the header?
[06:43:30] <shoky> Vivekananda  you have:  "fruits": {...}, {...}    that's not valid js.   also that's not the source format required by jquery-ui autocomplete
[06:46:11] <shoky> Vivekananda also you have a typo  $('.auto_complete_snakcs')   and also why are you initializing the autocomplete widget on every keyup ...
[06:46:34] <shoky> and so on.
[06:54:58] <Vivekananda> shoky: I changed it to http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/2/ . it works fine now. My ultimate aim is to get a type ahead which is a little complicated for my skills at the moment but I am trying.  what I want is that when I start typing  green I see a readahead saying  Fruits \n  sweets. And when I click on each it gets expanded to its subheader and that in turn to green
[06:56:22] <shoky> good luck with that. you posted the same link btw
[06:57:19] <Vivekananda> shoky: is it too complicated for me at this point ?
[06:57:28] <Vivekananda> It would help a lot to get some pointers
[06:57:50] <shoky> Vivekananda: yes i'd say it's too complicated for you at this point
[06:58:27] <Vivekananda> shoky: so there is no way I can break it down and do a part at a time then ?
[06:58:32] <shoky> you want to completely change how the autocomplete widget works..
[06:59:20] <shoky> of course there is, that's how you should do anything
[06:59:31] <Vivekananda> but 1. I dont necessesarily want to use the widget rather just the autocomplete 2. the widget already has a categoriezed view demo
[07:00:14] <shoky> like i told you several times yesterday
[07:00:24] <shoky> if you have a specific question, we'll gladly answer it
[07:00:55] <Vivekananda> okay let me try more specific ones then
[07:01:24] <Vivekananda> why does saying , source: results ; get me an error. ? I thought that ; is marker of end of sentence
[07:01:34] <shoky> and no idea what you meant by #1  the autocomplete IS the widget
[07:01:43] <scythea> Does anyone have a link to a well explained tutorial for a like/unlike system? I've trawled google but cannot find any that looks even remotely professional.
[07:02:23] <Vivekananda> also point me jquery reading or tutorial for getting up to speed on this
[07:02:28] <shoky> Vivekananda  but that's not the end of the statement
[07:02:38] <shoky> you can't put a ; inside an object literal { ... }
[07:02:48] <shoky> { source: results }
[07:02:53] <shoky> not  { source: results ; }
[07:03:15] <shoky> see, you barely know basic javascript, this is why i say it's too complicated for you right now
[07:05:14] <scythea> Essentially something like this https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1541675/favorites-star-switching-in-javascript so if anyone has any idea...
[07:07:51] <Vivekananda> shoky: the reason for getting confused is two fold. first I dont know the syntax ==  source : hello  and such well coz did not come across them in jquery tutorials I just did. Second what you said about ; not being possible inside an object goes contrary to some example codes i created and ran successfully as in  https://gist.github.com/vvikramjhu/8769695
[07:07:58] <scythea> I have something like this right now http://jsfiddle.net/3H59R/ but if you click the item once you changed its state, it still follows the old path, that is, it thinks it is still liked when it has been unliked
[07:08:49] <shoky> Vivekananda:  there is no object literal in that gist
[07:09:08] <scythea> I was told to implement  e.parentNode.removeChild(e); but I'm not sure where or why
[07:09:42] <shoky> Vivekananda and there's no need to be apologetic about your confusion/skills. we're all learning here
[07:11:49] <Vivekananda> hmmm okay. so you are saying there is no object literal in the gist. Isnt anything withing curly {}  automatically become an object literal ?
[07:16:05] <shoky> no
[07:16:09] <shoky> function() { ... }
[07:16:15] <shoky> that's not an object literal, that's a function
[07:16:23] <shoky> var o = { ... };
[07:16:25] <shoky> that's an object literal
[07:17:15] <shoky> Vivekananda you should learn javascript
[07:18:49] <scythea> Anyone?
[08:10:08] <no_gravity> Good Evening! Does anybody here know, how jquery is able to read json data from other domains?
[08:10:16] <kegster> when pulling DOM objects in via ajax, i need to use $('.static_parent').on('click', '.dynamic_item', function() {}); --- How can I apply this same logic to selecting an iframe that's brought in after dom is loaded (ajax), and resizing it for auto-height purposes?
[08:10:34] <kegster> i have iframes that are pulling piwik widgets, but the widget iframe content changes as the data loads in -- depends on how long it takes to load
[08:31:26] <kegster> how can i select elements that are added after dom is loaded?
[08:34:20] <decx> kegster target a parent container that is present on load and then watch it with .on() for events from specific elements $('#myparent').on('click','.mygeneratedelement',function(){})
[08:35:25] <kegster> decx: what about on an ajax call succeeding?
[08:35:39] <kegster> i have iframes being loaded and want to try to setInterval and resize them auto-height
[08:35:41] <kegster> i hate iframes
[08:36:00] <decx> that is normal, everyone does
[08:38:33] <kegster> :D
[08:45:06] <skullcrasher> hey there
[08:45:48] <skullcrasher> how would you append a form field to an html form (should only show the values uneditable)
[08:46:11] <skullcrasher> i thought of a hidden form field, but my problem is that each row should later define an object
[08:46:30] <skullcrasher> or better the objects attributes
[09:12:05] <viktorbeer> hello, how to fadeout those divs when clciking outside of them http://jsfiddle.net/viktorbeer/2Uuvy/
[10:32:07] <nahtnam> Hey! I have this code: http://pastie.org/8691937 and when ever you hover over a text field, it works, BUT I want it so that one the input field is focused on, to show the tooltip. (If that makes any sense). How would I do that?
[10:32:20] <nahtnam> *when
[10:36:44] <nahtnam> Never mind. Thanks
[10:38:16] <decx> yeah you can use the function .tooltip('enable') on focusin
[10:40:15] <nahtnam> decx: ? I have a temporary fix but its really buggy
[10:41:06] <decx> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13233304/how-to-make-jqueryui-tooltip-apply-only-on-focus/13238816#13238816
[10:56:04] <gordian> i have a project with two files: one i can't edit which sends an AJAX request, and nother i can edit where i want to trigger an action when the first file's AJAX request is complete–is this possible?
[10:56:23] <gordian> if so, how? which jQuery function should i look into?
[11:01:42] <nahtnam> decx: This code works similarly to that: http://pastie.org/8692008
[11:02:05] <nahtnam> The only issue is that if you put autofocus="true", it doesnt show up until you unfocus and then refocus
[11:14:09] <Zer000> can someone tell me which source file .serialize is in? I want to write my own version that doesn't ignore file field metadata
[11:16:23] <decx> Zer000 ui/sortable.js
[11:16:33] <Zer000> decx: ty!
[11:21:52] <nahtnam> decx: Do you know how to fix it?
[11:22:48] <nahtnam> decx: The stackoverflow answer wont work
[11:23:24] <decx> i only checked the fiddle and it worked well
[11:23:47] <decx> that way is better than calling the tooltip function fresh on every hover
[11:24:15] <nahtnam> decx: I know but for some reason its not working. It only shows up on hover
[11:24:36] <decx> fiddle it
[11:24:40] <Vivekananda> hey everyone
[11:24:44] <Vivekananda> hi decx
[11:24:47] <decx> hi
[11:24:48] <Vivekananda> I have changed the ds and currenlty and trying to do the simplest thing ie append results. http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/2/
[11:25:05] <Vivekananda> what am I doing wrong ?
[11:25:24] <Vivekananda> let me try it with a simple ds first
[11:26:06] <decx> i don't have the mental endurance to debug an autocomplete let's hope there's somebody here that does ;)
[11:29:23] <gordian> is there some event listener i can use for receiving a response header?
[11:30:11] <nahtnam> decx: I got it fully working! :) http://pastie.org/8692078
[11:31:11] <decx> lol nahtnam i checked the tooltip docs for something like that and didnt see it, that's what you get for flying over a block of text ;)
[11:31:23] <nahtnam> decx: :P
[11:34:22] <decx> the trigger option isnt even mentioned in the docs wtf
[11:35:07] <nahtnam> decx: Really?
[11:35:45] <shoky> Vivekananda you keep posting the same jsfiddle link. it still has the syntax error with  {"fruits": {..}, {..}  }     which is illegal javascript
[11:36:28] <Vivekananda> shoky: I changed it! I have even a new ds now http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/3/
[11:36:49] <decx> is fiddle down?
[11:36:52] <shoky> Vivekananda: ok. there's still a syntax error. have you checked your console?
[11:36:56] <shoky> decx: nope
[11:37:06] <decx> damn isp
[11:38:13] <shoky> Vivekananda:  you put code inside an object literal.. can't do that.  referring to:  $(this).autocomplete({  ...  })    you put code in the ...
[11:38:39] <shoky> Vivekananda: but that's an object literal, that's where the key: value  pairs go.  of course the value of such a pair can be a function with code inside it
[11:38:57] <Vivekananda> shoky: http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/4/
[11:39:28] <shoky> Vivekananda: no, you can't pass a function to .autocomplete()
[11:39:46] <shoky> why are you calling .autocomplete  inside a keyup listener anyway :\
[11:40:00] <shoky> you want to call .autocomplete(..)  only once, to initialize the widget
[11:42:13] <Vivekananda> shoky: making more sense it is
[11:42:16] <Vivekananda> slowly
[12:20:35] <Vivekananda> In this demo code http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#categories where is the $(function) defined on line 34 called ?
[12:33:05] <jupiterfunk> Hello. I have this call: $(document.body).mousemove(seedCords(event)); and it's not working, but it is in ...mousemove(function(event) { seed(event); }); .  Is there a way to make this work without anonymous functions?
[12:41:52] <shoky> Vivekananda: it's called by jquery when the DOM is ready.  $(function() { ... })   is the same as  $(document).ready(function() { ... })
[12:43:24] <shoky> jupiterfunk:  $(document.body).mousemove(seed)

[12:53:55] <hiby007> still not defined let me inject it again and try
[12:54:28] <shoky> there's a built in $ , that's what you were using
[12:54:37] <shoky> built-in to the console, that is
[12:54:59] <hiby007> oh
[12:55:15] <shoky> but if jquery is loaded it should override the built-in one
[12:55:36] <hiby007> yes i injected the jquery with this code var script = document.createElement('script');script.src = "https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.6.3/jquery.min.js";document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);
[12:55:51] <hiby007> it is loaded successfully

[12:56:28] <shoky> but anyway,
[12:56:32] <hiby007> ok trying with 2.0.3
[12:56:42] <shoky> if it is loaded successfully then  jQuery.fn.jquery should be defined
[12:57:14] <hiby007> nope still now working
[12:57:34] <hiby007> injected with 2.0.3
[12:57:55] <shoky> guess there's a problem with your injection, i donno

[13:17:15] <imacinto> I'm trying to write a password reveal plugin and I'd like to create a new element for each field to reveal, but it seems to be that I only make one element. The plugin is here: http://codepen.io/ianjmacintosh/pen/DqCjB and the specific line of interest is in the JS tab at line 24
[13:18:17] <hiby007> shoky yes sir found it with scrollHeight, thank you once again. :D :D
[13:30:50] <Vivekananda> shoky: thanks. I am trying to remodel my problem based on the widget . http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/4/ currently I am getting catcomplete is not a function but this is the same code ( similar) as in demo  http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#categories
[13:32:46] <ShawnRisk> How do I call a jQuery function inside my html when I have multiple js files?
[13:33:52] <Vivekananda> ShawnRisk: shouldnt you be calling jquery inside the js files ? I mean if you have multiple files then they must be to separate out code of js / jquery
[13:33:56] <Vivekananda> from html
[13:34:15] <Vivekananda> also if there is no clash of functions then just calling it by name should do it
[13:34:40] <ShawnRisk> I want to do something like onclick="example()" that is an example not the real code I will use.
[13:35:34] <Vivekananda> ShawnRisk: you can do that in the js file itself. are you familiar with document.onload or document.ready ?
[13:35:49] <coderego> Hey guys, I would like to have a table with some data in it that i can edit in the table and have it post back to my PHP back end via AJAX. Do you have a recommended tutorial/plugin?
[13:36:07] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: yes
[13:36:46] <DevePy> a
[13:37:05] <Vivekananda> okay then in your correct js file you will say  something like $(document).ready(function(){ $('div').click(do something) });
[13:37:39] <Vivekananda> to make sense of this syntax and for live examples I just finished some very simple examples in codeacademy and it helped quite a bit with such stuff
[13:37:51] <Vivekananda> although I am struggligh with something bigger now :(
[13:39:07] <Vivekananda> ShawnRisk: this page has some quick snippets http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/
[13:39:17] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: yes but how do that with ontimeupdate with is apart of html5 audio?
[13:39:33] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: I know how jquery works, I just trying to understand this more
[13:39:44] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: what is your problem?
[13:39:48] <Vivekananda> same here :). in your boat I am too
[13:39:54] <Vivekananda> oo well my problem is
[13:40:15] <Vivekananda>  I am trying to remodel my problem based on the widget . http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/4/ currently I am getting catcomplete is not a function but this is the same code ( similar) as in demo  http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#categories
[13:40:51] <coderego> Hey guys, I would like to have a table with some data in it that i can edit in the table and have it post back to my PHP back end via AJAX. Do you have a recommended tutorial/plugin?
[13:43:38] <Vivekananda> codebrainz: :( I dont but someone better might be around so stick around
[13:43:48] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: when searching, there is nothing found
[13:43:52] <Vivekananda> stackoverflow helps if you can break down the problem
[13:45:09] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: did you check the errors in console?
[13:45:55] <Vivekananda> ShawnRisk: sorry I updated it just now
[13:45:55] <Vivekananda> http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/6/
[13:46:05] <Vivekananda> this is the one I am workign with
[13:47:28] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: okay but still not searching
[13:47:45] <Vivekananda> yes
[13:48:15] <Vivekananda> I included all code inside the ready function. In the console I see "catcomplete" is not defined but this code works for the
[13:48:20] <Vivekananda> demo site
[13:48:33] <Vivekananda> my error is : catcomplete is not a function
[13:52:21] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: read this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3574303/jquery-autocomplete-not-working-for-catcomplete
[13:56:40] <Vivekananda> ShawnRisk: I changed the order of functions and am notgetting the same error
[13:56:50] <Vivekananda> but still dont see the typeaheadhttp://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/8/
[13:57:12] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: link properly
[13:57:36] <Vivekananda> sorry http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/8/
[13:59:34] <dows> Hey guys.
[14:00:01] <dows> I ve got a quick question about the .ready() eventhandler
[14:00:47] <dows> if i use .ready() on <iframe> does it fire if the frame content loaded or if just the element is loaded
[14:01:11] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: did you read that catcomplete is not apart of jQuery UI?
[14:12:27] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: yes?
[14:12:58] <Vivekananda> ShawnRisk: sorry got dc yes I read it but for some reason the error stopped showing up
[14:13:07] <Vivekananda> then I realzied it is perhaps an issue with
[14:13:14] <Vivekananda> fiddle
[14:13:40] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: does your demo site make this work?
[14:16:05] <Vivekananda> by demo I meant the jquery demo itself
[14:16:41] <Vivekananda> ie http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#categories this one
[14:16:56] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: oh
[14:25:08] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: do you have a class or function called catcomplete?
[14:31:49] <Vivekananda> ShawnRisk: nope
[14:31:58] <Vivekananda> but I was just copying over the code from the demo
[14:32:46] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: read the link I gave you closely
[14:34:36] <Vivekananda> ShawnRisk: I did read and realized that catcomplete is needed. I then thought that until I create that class or function I will keep getting the error but for the current version of jsfiddle  I am not getting any console errors. Do you get that error ?  I stopped getting it    http://jsfiddle.net/vvikramjhu/hx72G/9/
[14:36:36] <ShawnRisk> Vivekananda: yes but you have to understand if everything is working properly.  If you are just throwing things in like I do all the time and not understand them, you will not know what you are needing to change in the long run.
[14:37:20] <Vivekananda> :) yes I quite agree with you. I am trying to now look for two things 1. why did the error stopped showing 2. how to write a custom function
[14:38:36] <shoky> Vivekananda: in that categories example, they are extending the autocomplete widget, actually creating a new type of widget called "catcomplete" which they then use (by calling .catcomplete() instead of .autocomplete() )
[14:39:29] <Vivekananda> good so when I copy over the code then should I not get the extending myself too ?
[14:39:39] <shoky> Vivekananda: in lines 19-31 they're extending the widget, and in lines 47-50 they are using the new widget they created
[14:39:50] <shoky> donno, didn't look at your code yet
[14:40:24] <shoky> yes you're extending it too
[14:42:05] <shoky> Vivekananda you defined a function:  function add_search_field(html_form_id, select_options)    but you're calling it with only 1 parameter:      add_search_field("#snacks_search");
[14:43:24] <shoky> Vivekananda: also, you need to initialize the widget on the <input>, not on the <form>
[14:46:57] <lundy> http://jsfiddle.net/34RDD/1/ - anyone know how I could detect if the Print dialog has been closed and if it has then do something?
[14:47:50] <shoky> Vivekananda: http://jsfiddle.net/hx72G/11/
[14:50:50] <ankurk> Hey guys, This code snippet runs perfectly fine on Chrome but not on Firefox. http://pastebin.com/LZCXqG7B. The error I am getting is 'event.target' is not defined.
[14:52:01] <shoky> ankurk: because firefox doesn't have a global "event" object. maybe you want e.target
[14:53:35] <ankurk> I actually tried e.target
[14:54:09] <ankurk> but then it doesn't append the input boxes as it is supposed to do
[14:55:15] <Vivekananda> shoky: thanks a tonne first ! but questions 1. if I include all the functions in the .ready is that incorrect ? I know it wont make logical sense coz the functions are not required to be instantiated at the time of the doc being ready but will the code then not work ? umm let me actually try with your code and see for myself
[14:56:13] <shoky> Vivekananda: indeed you can see for yourself. but yea it will still work
[14:56:27] <paulvd> i have a value stored in postid, which i want to use it in the url string, jQuery("#exercise-container").load("http://<?php echo $_SERVER[HTTP_HOST]; ?>/exercise-post/#post_id"); will this work fine?
[14:56:36] <paulvd> post_id
[14:57:38] <ankurk> Or is there any other alternative to event.target?
[14:57:39] <Vivekananda> 2. if I change you input calling line to this :  $('search_button').catcomplete ({    )}; then it does not work
[14:58:17] <ankurk> I basically want to get the name of the button that has been clicked
[14:58:19] <shoky> ankurk the problem is the event is a custom event by the fileupload plugin
[14:58:43] <shoky> ankurk also watch out.. you're calling data.submit() multiple times inside the loop
[14:58:44] <ankurk> that's what I figured, that plugin might be the culprit here
[14:58:49] <paulvd> ???????????
[14:59:16] <ankurk> Shoky: I am calling data.submit because the user can upload multiple files at once.
[14:59:34] <shoky> ankurk: so what?  tehre is only one "data" and you're calling it's submit function N times
[14:59:48] <shoky> it should be outside the loop
[15:00:13] <ankurk> okay, I will change that.
[15:00:35] <ankurk> So is there any alternative to get the name of the button that has been clicked?
[15:01:26] <shoky> ankurk  data.fileInput
[15:02:13] <Vivekananda> shoky: 2. if I change you input calling line ( which is div.find('input')......)   to this :  $('search_button').catcomplete ({    )}; then it does not work
[15:02:15] <ankurk> Any link I can learn about this?
[15:02:20] <ankurk> *where
[15:02:29] <shoky> ankurk: https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/Options#wiki-fileinput
[15:02:43] <shoky> ankurk: and just by debugging and doing console.log(data) for example to see what properties it has
[15:03:06] <shoky> Vivekananda: so what?
[15:03:29] <ankurk> Okay I will check that for sure.
[15:14:48] <Vivekananda> I mean that if I call the input by its id then it should work shouldnt it . Forgot to put #search_button
[15:16:21] <shoky> Vivekananda: why would you call an autocomplete widget on a <button> ?
[15:17:06] <shoky> on a button, i mean
[15:20:25] <Vivekananda> shoky: you are right that is stupid. My intention is to call it on the id of the text search box but for the code I have I dont know how to do that. I am assuming that I will have to attach an id to the search box  and/or a class and then call that id / class
[15:20:28] <Vivekananda> right ?
[15:22:04] <shoky> Vivekananda: that is one way to do it. but i showed you another way
[15:22:23] <shoky> div.find('input')
[15:22:48] <shoky> you already have the div that you just added to the DOM, so you can find the <input> inside it
[15:28:17] <Vivekananda> I figured it out :)
[15:28:43] <shoky> great job
[15:28:45] <Vivekananda> was a stupid question. I used .auto_complete_snacks as the object
[15:28:52] <Vivekananda> but this is only a part of it
[15:29:22] <shoky> `ftjq
[15:29:22] <b-ot> shoky: http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[15:29:34] <shoky> Vivekananda you'll probably find that link useful
[15:29:40] <Vivekananda> now am going to make it a little more complicated and keep working till I achieve the functionality that I want. Next is to change the data structure
[15:29:44] <shoky> if you like playing with stuff.
[15:33:41] <utomox> Does anyone know if it's possible to pass in a variable from a function call to a .click in jquery?
[15:33:46] <Vivekananda> that is interesting but is a bunch of podcasts
[15:34:18] <utomox> such as this
[15:34:19] <utomox> function buttonLocate(val) {
[15:34:19] <utomox> 	$("#val").click( function() {
[15:34:23] <utomox> But that doesn't work
[15:49:27] <Vivekananda> utomox
[15:49:31] <Vivekananda> you there ?
[15:49:32] <utomox> Hi
[15:49:48] <Vivekananda> I was just reading this . giving you the link. Tell me if that helps
[15:50:21] <Vivekananda> http://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/  look at callbacks with arguments
[15:54:04] <utomox> That's not what I'm looking for
[15:54:07] <utomox> Sorry
[15:56:07] <Vivekananda> utomox: you can get the value in a separte function and assign it to a variable and then use that variable
[15:56:15] <utomox> o_o
[15:57:43] <Vivekananda> the link I gave you would be helpful to pass an argument to a function once you have a val. but if you dont have it then triggering a variable storage on some click
[15:57:55] <Vivekananda> would be my first step.
[15:59:16] <shoky> Vivekananda huh it's not podcasts. it's very informative slides
[15:59:42] <Vivekananda> really ?
[15:59:49] <shoky> yeah.. keep going right
[16:00:21] <Vivekananda> I got this --  http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[16:00:32] <Vivekananda> how do I move right ? it is a webpage I got
[16:00:43] <shoky> arrow keys
[16:00:48] <Vivekananda> oo ok
[16:00:53] <Vivekananda> yep got it
[16:04:07] <utomox> Vivekananda, I mean this - http://jsfiddle.net/g42RV/
[16:06:59] <shoky> utomox: $('.button')
[16:07:08] <utomox> what?
[16:07:31] <shoky> utomox: http://jsfiddle.net/g42RV/1/
[16:08:14] <utomox> Oh that's awesome
[16:08:16] <utomox> Thanks a lot :)
[16:12:48] <utomox> shoky, and to add onto that, is it possible to have a form field which can be entered into, say for a city, so if the user types for example "Texas", it'll add an <a> tag with "Texas" as the value, the id of "Texas", and the innerHTML of the <a> as Texas?
[16:14:06] <decx> value on anchors? am i taking crazy pills here, isn't that invalid? :o
[16:15:49] <utomox> Who says it's invalid?
[16:17:56] <decx> the rules of the universe
[16:18:19] <utomox> Oh no ;o
[16:18:26] <utomox> What would you suggest I use instead?
[16:18:53] <decx> data-value, data-cityname, data-whatever. anything with data-* really
[16:19:21] <utomox> Can data-cityname in this instance be gotten from jquery?
[16:19:24] <utomox> In my jsfiddle
[16:19:24] <decx> also has a shorthand, .data('value') would be the same as .attr('data-value')
[16:19:53] <utomox> So instead of
[16:19:54] <utomox> var text = $(this).attr("value");
[16:19:57] <utomox> I'd use
[16:20:05] <utomox> var text = $(this).attr('data-value');
[16:20:06] <utomox> ?
[16:20:35] <decx> yes, or $(this).data('value')
[16:20:50] <utomox> alright, i'll change it :)
[16:21:37] <utomox> hm, how to do data-value in Jade
[17:26:20] <shoky> Tomashe: .closest goes up the dom from parent to parent
[17:26:20] <shoky> Tomashe:  your .rmenu <div> is not parent of anything
