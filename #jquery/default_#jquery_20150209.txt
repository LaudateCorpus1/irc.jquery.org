[00:03:08] <wiggl3> Wise parting words by sagittarian|2
[00:03:23] <wiggl3> Let me add to that:
[00:03:32] <wiggl3> We are singular
[00:03:36] <wiggl3> I am plural
[00:03:43] <wiggl3> Us being the shepherd
[00:04:00] <Cork> wiggl3: that line should work
[00:04:07] <Cork> the later wont though
[00:04:36] <Cork> wiggl3: though find/not does always return an object
[00:04:43] <Cork> so the if case you use won't ever fail
[00:06:25] <wiggl3> hmmm
[00:06:48] <Cork> wiggl3: http://jsfiddle.net/uob8j9h0/1/
[00:07:18] <Cork> and the second test doesn't have a child div
[00:07:26] <Cork> so changed the find
[00:08:43] <wiggl3> Cork: that's awesome - thank you so much!
[00:10:39] <wiggl3> Cork: what you working on?
[00:10:57] <Cork> just work stuff
[00:12:25] <wiggl3> Cork: fair enough
[00:16:31] <kongthap> i like to traverse one level up from current selector, please help to fix my error coding, http://pastie.org/9921979
[00:17:35] <Cork> kongthap: never put element names infront of ids
[00:18:10] <Cork> and ?paste @ kongthap
[00:18:18] <Cork> gah.... dead bot
[00:18:36] <Cork> kongthap: make an example of the problem http://jsfiddle.net/
[00:18:43] <Cork> including the related html
[00:18:52] <kongthap> Cork, ok
[00:18:55] <Cork> (but not more then needed, keep it small if possible)
[00:23:26] <kongthap> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/jeud/epcs5sks/, i like to remove all <tr class="template"> then append <tbody> with new set of <tr>
[00:27:35] <amore123> I have this line to detect the end of a page:    //if($(window).scrollTop() == ($(document).height() - $(window).height())) When I go down, ___sometimes____ it detect it twice consecutively.. what I can I do?
[00:28:41] <Cork> kongthap: http://jsfiddle.net/epcs5sks/1/
[00:28:52] <Cork> move the script tag and things becomes much simpler
[00:29:03] <amore123> I mean, in less than one tenth of second
[00:29:30] <Cork> amore123: paste your code in http://jsfiddle.net/
[00:30:50] <amore123> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/1t7c9cu2/
[00:31:22] <amore123> Im using Firefox 34
[00:32:09] <Cork> amore123: user scrollMaxY instead
[00:32:11] <Cork> *use
[00:32:26] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.scrollMaxX
[00:32:40] <Cork> uh wrong link
[00:32:51] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.scrollMaxY
[00:33:13] <amore123> instead of scrollTop?
[00:33:23] <Cork> instead of height
[00:33:47] <Cork> scrollMaxY == scrollY == end
[00:34:37] <kongthap> Cork, thanks :)
[00:36:13] <kongthap> Cork, sorry i may do renderTemplate() more than once, with that selector *my template* will be gone
[00:36:32] <amore123> this is my if now:    if($(window).scrollTop() == ($(document).scrollMaxY - $(window).scrollMaxY)) but nothing happens
[00:36:33] <Cork> no, not the template
[00:36:46] <Cork> kongthap: if you read what i said i sait to move it
[00:36:54] <kongthap> Cork, OK OK :)
[00:36:58] <Cork> amore123: those aren't jquery values
[00:37:09] <Cork> kongthap: check the fiddle
[00:37:11] <Cork> i did it there
[00:37:59] <amore123> do you mean like this:    if($(window).scrollTop() == (document.scrollMaxY - window.scrollMaxY))
[00:38:09] <amore123> anyway nothing happens
[00:39:04] <Cork> amore123: http://jsfiddle.net/w9r60hte/
[00:39:39] <Cork> though that said, you prob want to have a bit of a move buffer
[00:39:46] <Cork> so the user doesn't have to hit the last pixel
[00:39:53] <Cork> and instead store so you only fire it once
[00:41:19] <Macaveli> width: 100%;
[00:41:30] <Macaveli> Does anyone know a framework that combines different tools like Dropbox, Google Drive, Classic File upload? So I have to implement 1 tool instead of 3 ?
[00:42:18] <amore123> Cork, still sometimes happens (the ajax inside is called twice consecutively..).. so what do you mean with a bit of move buffer?
[00:43:26] <sacho> amore123, use a debounce mechanism to prevent that
[00:43:40] <sacho> there's a spam bot, tumtune in the channel
[00:45:50] <sacho> amore123, for example, cache the promise you get from $.ajax(), return the cached promise if you get further requests and remove the cached value when it's resolved
[00:45:51] <Cork> amore123: http://jsfiddle.net/w9r60hte/2/
[00:46:30] <sacho> or a flag, yeah.
[00:46:53] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/w9r60hte/3/ <-- fixed indentation
[00:47:59] <Erwat> javascript compile times in minutes
[00:48:06] <Erwat> it's like i really am writing c++ again
[00:50:11] <amore123> Cork, sacho thanks!! it seems it doesn't happen any more
[01:09:48] <NikoZz> hi there
[01:10:16] <NikoZz> after an ajax call Im not able to use my js functions
[01:10:36] <NikoZz> any ideas? I have to add them inside the results content of the ajax calls to make them available..
[01:14:49] <sacho> what do you mean "I'm not able to use"
[01:15:01] <sacho> and do you have sample code on jsfiddle illustrating your problem?
[01:15:25] <Cork> NikoZz: wild guess, but: ajax is async so you have to wait for the server response for the code to be pulled
[01:16:06] <Cork> also depending on how you load the js it might or might not be executed at all
[01:16:08] <NikoZz> sacho: no its too complicated to post smth on jsfiddle.. :/
[01:16:22] <Cork> O_o'
[01:16:24] <NikoZz> Cork: the dom is loaded.. so all the js functions are loaded
[01:16:27] <Cork> i doubt that very much
[01:16:29] <NikoZz> then I make the ajax call
[01:17:11] <sacho> and then?
[01:17:34] <NikoZz> and then I get an error function is not defined..
[01:17:47] <NikoZz> if I post the function within the ajax results then its ok
[01:18:17] <Cork> depending on how the js is loaded it might be a scope issue
[01:18:24] <Cork> you really need to create a fiddle
[01:19:23] <NikoZz> with the ajax call I load some buttons with onclick events
[01:19:35] <NikoZz> onclick="loadProject(35)" for example
[01:19:50] <NikoZz> the loadProject function is predefined but cannot be found
[01:20:06] <Cork> nickyd: show the code instead of talking about the code
[01:20:16] <Cork> it is much simpler to understand, and quicker to see the problem
[01:20:44] <NikoZz> Cork: if I could I would have shown the code.. its too complicated to post it
[01:21:04] <Cork> NikoZz: so post the related snippet
[01:21:07] <Cork> doesn't have to be complete
[01:21:28] <Cork> but talking about code, when the code can't be reached in the page, is close to pointless
[01:21:45] <Cork> cause it depends on you understanding why it can't be accessed
[01:21:51] <Cork> and if you do, you wouldn't have to ask
[01:21:51] <NikoZz> ok, i'll give it a try
[01:23:12] <Omar-> good morning
[01:23:27] <Omar-> some one kick tumtune
[01:23:31] <Omar-> pls
[01:24:17] <NikoZz> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/4jytgbt5/
[01:24:26] <NikoZz> I load these two buttons with the ajax call
[01:25:17] <Cork> NikoZz: you forgot the function declaration
[01:25:33] <Cork> Omar-: your request is my demand :)
[01:26:39] <NikoZz> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/4jytgbt5/1/
[01:27:03] <NikoZz> but the function is declared at the end of the DOM not inside the ajax call results
[01:27:07] <Cork> NikoZz: in what context is that function declared?
[01:27:21] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/4jytgbt5/2/
[01:27:38] <NikoZz> yeap sorry
[01:27:57] <Cork> meaning are you declaring that function inside another function or something like that?
[01:28:05] <NikoZz> no no
[01:28:11] <Cork> like $(function() { function delProject() {} })
[01:28:19] <Cork> or $(document).ready(function() { function delProject() {} })
[01:28:31] <NikoZz> ok inside jQuery(document).ready(function() { }
[01:28:35] <Cork> so yes :)
[01:28:40] <Cork> and there is you're reason
[01:28:44] <NikoZz> really? :|
[01:28:49] <Cork> event attribute is global
[01:28:55] <Cork> they can only access global functions
[01:29:09] <Cork> NikoZz: the correct solution is to NOT use event attribute
[01:29:12] <Cork> use event handlers instead
[01:29:35] <NikoZz> you mean $("#id").click(function() {}); ?
[01:29:38] <Cork> add a class to the button and use a delegated event handler in js
[01:29:56] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'button.delete', delProject);
[01:30:16] <Cork> and <button class="delete" data-id="30">
[01:30:16] <NikoZz> ok let me try! thanks a lot!! :)))
[01:30:31] <Cork> and in the handler do $(this).data('id') to get 30
[01:45:57] <NikoZz> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/4jytgbt5/3/
[01:46:05] <NikoZz> in jsfiddle it works
[01:46:13] <NikoZz> but in my project not.. :/
[01:46:27] <Erwat> wow we're loading almost a whole megabyte of libraries on this
[01:47:29] <Uhkis> NikoZz: how about using what Cork said instead of .click()
[01:48:00] <NikoZz> I thought its the same
[01:48:01] <Erwat> oh nvm these are nonminified libraries
[01:48:02] <Erwat> makes sense
[01:48:38] <Cork> NikoZz: http://jsfiddle.net/4jytgbt5/4/
[01:49:15] <Cork> GAH forgot to define the variable...
[01:49:32] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/4jytgbt5/5/
[01:49:53] <NikoZz> Cork: it works.. you rock man
[01:50:05] <NikoZz> sorry for having hard time with me.. Im still new to this :|
[01:50:23] <Cork> NikoZz: as a STRONG suggestion, forbid the user of on*anything* in the html
[01:50:31] <Cork> your life will be much better
[01:50:36] <Uhkis> cork ~= rock ;-)
[01:51:11] <Erwat> Cork: could you say that again?
[01:51:23] <Cork> Erwat: say what?
[01:51:24] <Erwat> do you mean that you shouldn't write onclick="..." in html?
[01:51:29] <Cork> yes
[01:51:35] <NikoZz> but why not?
[01:51:48] <Erwat> how do you deal with events going from the button to the function you want them to?
[01:51:50] <Cork> cause it is a legacy solution with tons of problems
[01:52:02] <Cork> Erwat: ever heard event handlers?
[01:52:13] <Cork> *heard of
[01:52:24] <Erwat> wait so you're adding the event handler in javascript later?
[01:52:37] <Cork> yes, where they should be
[01:52:48] <Cork> scoped and not global (if possible)
[01:53:23] <Cork> NikoZz: you've just hit one of the reasons
[01:53:24] <Erwat> do you still get the button and do mybutton.onclick = function... ?
[01:53:46] <Cork> a function you thought you had access to but doesn't cause you lose the scope
[01:54:00] <Cork> Erwat: that is just another form of event attribute
[01:54:12] <Erwat> is that a yes?
[01:54:20] <Cork> event handlers are addEventListener/attachEvent/$().on/$().bind
[01:54:52] <Cork> you do a selection for the element and attach the handler yes
[01:55:01] <Cork> but not with onclick
[01:55:24] <Erwat> so mybutton.addEventListener('click', blah)?
[01:55:29] <Cork> yes
[01:55:44] <Erwat> thank you, i'll use that going forward then
[01:55:44] <Cork> i've taken it one step further in later projects and forbid evaling code all together
[01:56:00] <Cork> so onclick="alert('hi')" only throws an error
[01:56:32] <Cork> csp FTW!
[01:56:43] <Erwat> csp?
[01:56:55] <Cork> Content Security Policy
[01:57:08] <Cork> you can set extra restrictions on what is allowed to happen in the page
[01:57:24] <Cork> and i disabled evaling of code through it
[01:57:29] <Erwat> i can't think of a way to concat libs that are used through requirejs's path
[01:57:36] <stangeland> Hi, i am trying to build a jquery plugin: http://jsfiddle.net/45an57hu/  But where would i put an init function, such that i can do $('.tstcls').dasbrowser().init() ?
[01:57:52] <Cork> Erwat: i think requirejs has an option to do it
[01:57:59] <Erwat> doesn't work for me
[01:58:09] <Cork> i've heard that before
[01:58:12] <Erwat> supposed to concat but just throws all files separately
[01:58:21] <Cork> i find the idea bad, so never used it for remote systems (web)
[01:58:37] <Erwat> that's what my complaint of "1 minute compile times in javascript" was about earlier
[01:58:42] <Cork> i use is heavily for files in local solutions (extensions, nodejs and so on)
[01:58:51] <Cork> but wouldn't touch it for remote
[01:59:23] <Cork> stangeland: you don't need to
[01:59:36] <Cork> stangeland: the function dasbroqwser  is what you declare at line 3
[02:01:32] <stangeland> Cork, ok, but the thing is that the init code is quite heavy, and in i want to let the developer choose if that init function should be called automatically on document ready or if it should wait until user clicks a button
[02:04:04] <Erwat> 1.1MB js -> 493kb of js when minified libs are used
[02:04:33] <Cork> stangeland: is this something that should happen once or ?
[02:04:50] <Cork> per element?
[02:05:11] <stangeland> Cork, yeah. its fething a filetree structure in an ajax call. And yeah, it might have multiple elements
[02:05:24] <stangeland> like, there might be multiple das browsers on a site
[02:11:38] <Cork> stangeland: you just answered a multiple answer question with "yes" -_-'
[02:11:49] <stangeland> Cork, ok, yes :)
[02:11:55] <Cork> "what is you're favorite food", "-yes"
[02:12:16] <Uhkis> answer makes as much sense as the question
[02:12:33] <Uhkis> "what is you are favorite food" ;-)
[02:12:43] <prohobo> I AM FAVORITE FOOD
[02:12:58] <prohobo> WHY
[02:13:20] <Cork> heh
[02:13:23] <Cork> ya, ya >_>
[02:13:54] <stangeland> Cork, sooo would it be an idea to create an init funciton somehow in that plugin?
[02:14:51] <samarjeet> hey all !!
[02:14:58] <Cork> you would have to answer what you need before i can answer that
[02:15:28] <samarjeet> Could someone help with https://github.com/samarjeet27/box-drop/blob/gh-pages/js/jquery.boxdrop.js#L25 ?
[02:15:38] <samarjeet> is there a better way to refer to ‘this' ?
[02:16:15] <samarjeet> i.e. accessing jQuery’s this inside click function ?
[02:16:16] <stangeland> Cork, i need to understand how i can create an init function on that plugin
[02:16:52] <Cork> samarjeet: you don't need $() for .index()
[02:17:09] <stangeland> ahhh wonderful :) I found a nice boilerplate: http://stefangabos.ro/jquery/jquery-plugin-boilerplate-revisited/
[02:17:30] <samarjeet> Cork: yes, but for finding the element, I need to convert it to a jquery object
[02:17:37] <Cork> no
[02:17:51] <Cork> var i = getDrop(me).index(this) does exactly the same thing
[02:17:58] <Cork> except less code need to execute
[02:18:26] <Cork> also .find('.box-title').find('.drop-image') => .find('.box-title .drop-image')
[02:18:27] <samarjeet> oh yes :P
[02:19:24] <samarjeet> Cork: but, is there a way other than storing this in a variable for the click function ?
[02:19:39] <Cork> not really
[02:19:48] <Cork> this is a special variable in functions
[02:19:58] <Cork> it takes new value for each function
[02:20:03] <samarjeet> yeah, that’s the object which is clicked
[02:20:04] <Cork> doesn't inherit
[02:20:22] <Cork> samarjeet: also line 27-28 looks really weird
[02:20:33] <Cork> what are you doing there?
[02:21:01] <samarjeet> Cork: it finds the nearest box content and toggles the dropdown
[02:21:15] <samarjeet> but I found that it has no attr found, so tried it with $()
[02:21:20] <Cork> samarjeet: are they siblings or something like that?
[02:21:38] <samarjeet> Cork: see https://github.com/samarjeet27/box-drop/blob/gh-pages/index.html
[02:21:48] <samarjeet> box container is the parent and has many box children
[02:21:56] <samarjeet> a box has box-title and box-content
[02:22:20] <samarjeet> there’s an element with .drop-image class which when clicked, toggles the corresponding box-content
[02:22:34] <Cork> samarjeet: so $(this).closest('.box-title').nextAll('.box-content').first() should do the same?
[02:22:38] <samarjeet> i.e. the box-content in the same div with class box
[02:23:12] <Cork> samarjeet: or even $(this).closest('.box').find('.box-content').first()
[02:24:00] <Cork> samarjeet: also i would prob delegate the click handler for the drop image
[02:24:03] <samarjeet> Cork: that doesn’t work
[02:24:12] <Cork> so you don't have to bind multiple handlers
[02:24:14] <Cork> samarjeet: why not?
[02:24:41] <samarjeet> when I use var $box = $(this).closest('.box').find('.box-content'); in line 27, it’s not responding
[02:25:57] <neuromute9> is it recommended to build up dom elements like this: $('<li>').attr('id', 'power').append($('<a>').attr('href', '#').html('Power Sockets'))
[02:25:59] <neuromute9> or this: '<li  id="power"><a href="#">Power Sockets</a></li>'
[02:26:19] <Cork> samarjeet: http://jsfiddle.net/qw0Lv54k/
[02:26:34] <Cork> samarjeet: also, please don't abuse <a>, use <button> for actions
[02:26:54] <Cork> opps typo
[02:27:04] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/qw0Lv54k/1/
[02:27:21] <Cork> samarjeet: and that is for if you bind it like $('.box-container').boxdrop();
[02:27:50] <samarjeet> Cork: in the fiddle, what is $(this) on click ?
[02:27:57] <Cork> the drop-image
[02:30:43] <samarjeet> ok Cork, I’ve updated the fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/qw0Lv54k/3/
[02:30:46] <samarjeet> it doesn’t work
[02:31:03] <samarjeet> when the user clicks on the arrow, it should collapse the content
[02:31:07] <samarjeet> or expand
[02:31:33] <Cork> uh
[02:31:41] <Cork> why don't you use just slideToggle btw?
[02:32:10] <samarjeet> Cork: because sometimes I need to use fade effects too :P
[02:32:27] <samarjeet> and it works here http://samarjeet27.github.io/box-drop
[02:32:42] <Cork> you used the one with the typo in it http://jsfiddle.net/qw0Lv54k/4/
[02:34:08] <samarjeet> oh Cork I didn’t know slideToggle was there :P
[02:34:14] <samarjeet> as a jquery function
[02:34:37] <samarjeet> Cork: btw was it only that which got it to work ?
[02:34:50] <Cork> samarjeet: added the missing ) on line 12
[02:35:03] <Cork> <Cork> opps typo
[02:35:03] <Cork> <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/qw0Lv54k/1/ <-- this fix
[02:35:29] <Cork> samarjeet: oh, and i included jquery :)
[02:35:36] <Cork> kinda needed :)
[02:35:55] <samarjeet> Cork: really needed :)
[02:36:13] <Naeblis> Hello. I'm trying to simulate keypress event using jQuery, but it seems the $(element).trigger(e) isn't working. e being a jquery event with keyCode 13.
[02:36:14] <Uhkis> overrated!
[02:36:48] <Cork> Naeblis: what are you trying to do?
[02:36:58] <Cork> .trigger event only fire javascript handlers
[02:37:04] <Cork> you can't fake a real user with it
[02:37:09] <Naeblis> simulate pressing enter after typing input in a field
[02:37:18] <Cork> ya, won't work
[02:37:30] <Cork> you can simulate sending enter for js handlers
[02:37:38] <Cork> but the browser won't care about it for the default action
[02:37:38] <djam90> I want to have a jQuery UI datepicker to say "Today" in the input field, and default to today. I tried defaultDate but it doesn't change the text in the input field?
[02:37:51] <Uhkis> if it's enter, wouldn't click trigger suffice?
[02:38:02] <Cork> for input?
[02:38:09] <Naeblis> for some reason, click() isn't working in IE 8
[02:38:10] <Cork> what would click do there?
[02:38:20] <Uhkis> submit the form in question?
[02:38:23] <Naeblis> (this is for automated browser testing)
[02:38:32] <Chulbul> Is there anything like, jquery mvc framework :o
[02:38:38] <Cork> Naeblis: the only thing you can do is .submit on the form
[02:38:48] <Naeblis> hmm
[02:38:48] <Cork> Naeblis: you can't fake user actions with .trigger
[02:39:00] <Cork> the browser has explicit code to prevent that
[02:39:05] <Naeblis> Cork: can you explain why this is?
[02:39:16] <Naeblis> security?
[02:39:16] <Cork> Naeblis: the simplest is for links
[02:39:18] <Cork> ya
[02:39:41] <Naeblis> hmm ok
[02:39:41] <Cork> a site could have 1000 <a> tabs with target="_blank" and just loop .click() over them
[02:39:47] <Cork> and you would break through popup blockers
[02:39:54] <Cork> same for form submission
[02:39:56] <Cork> and so on
[02:40:11] <Naeblis> darn
[02:40:15] <Cork> so form element and links flag user actions
[02:40:26] <Cork> and only do the default action if it was done by the "real" user
[02:40:41] <Cork> testing suites usually has privileged code running outside the site
[02:40:42] <Naeblis> I'm actually using python's splinter (an abstraction over selenium) for testing, and while I can do button.click(), that doesn't seem to work in IE
[02:40:49] <Cork> where they can generate the trusted event needed
[02:40:58] <Naeblis> or well, it fails intermittently
[02:41:19] <Cork> but ya, like always testing in ie is a pain
[02:43:07] <misza222> hi folks, I'd like to change jquery mobile slider behaviour to show number input on the right instead of the left of the slider itself. Any ideas what is the best way to do this?
[02:45:20] <samarjeet> Cork: what are the drawbacks of using the ‘a’ element for this ?
[02:45:34] <Cork> samarjeet: <a> is for links
[02:45:51] <Cork> it is meant to have an url or at least an id in the page for target
[02:46:00] <Cork> <button> is for click actions
[02:46:02] <misza222> just curious, as have a working solution here http://jsfiddle.net/misza222/zumy20a3/, but is it the best/easiest way to do this?
[02:46:15] <samarjeet> yeah, but it’s a toggle
[02:46:24] <Cork> samarjeet: both can be styled the same, so there is no reason for for abusing <a>
[02:46:24] <samarjeet> bootstrap also hass a.dropdown-toggle
[02:46:37] <Cork> and it has to be an <a> tag?
[02:46:45] <djam90> I want to have a jQuery UI datepicker to say "Today" in the input field, and default to today. I tried defaultDate but it doesn't change the text in the input field?
[02:46:50] <Cork> it explicitly targets a.dropdown-toggle??
[02:47:42] <samarjeet> for the toggles ? yes
[02:47:47] <samarjeet> see http://getbootstrap.com/components/
[02:47:52] <samarjeet> using dropdowns
[02:48:30] <Cork> uh
[02:48:32] <samarjeet> anyways, button can also be used
[02:48:38] <Cork> <button type="button" class="btn btn-default dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-expanded="false"> <_<
[02:48:43] <samarjeet> I’ve updated it to use button http://jsfiddle.net/qw0Lv54k/5/
[02:48:49] <Cork> they don't use it in there own examples at least
[02:49:10] <samarjeet> Cork: yes, but the site states that :P
[02:49:14] <samarjeet> updated to use button element
[02:49:16] <samarjeet> http://jsfiddle.net/qw0Lv54k/5/
[02:49:34] <Cork> saw it the first time
[02:49:46] <samarjeet> Cork: is there a way to remove the unnecessary highlight when the down arrow is clicked ?
[02:50:18] <Cork> highlight?
[02:50:51] <Cork> ah ,the focus ring
[02:51:03] <samarjeet> yup
[02:51:26] <samarjeet> maybe with css ?
[02:51:47] <samarjeet> Cork: see http://postimg.org/image/zbj5m0sub/
[02:51:50] <Cork> :focus { outline: none; } should work if i remember correct
[02:52:25] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/qw0Lv54k/6/
[02:52:56] <samarjeet> btw Cork wouldn’t it be better to use <span> in this case ?
[02:53:30] <Cork> samarjeet: if you set aria attributes so it becomes visible to none seeing user/tools sure
[02:53:39] <Cork> works fine
[02:53:51] <Cork> button gives you that for free
[02:54:24] <samarjeet> Cork: settled on button :)
[02:54:28] <samarjeet> thanks :)
[02:54:35] <djam90> Could anyone help me get a datepicker to show "Today" in the input field, and default to today? http://jsfiddle.net/xwqv9zop/
[02:54:49] <Cork> samarjeet: and just to be clear, that was a side note - a correctness comment
[02:54:53] <Cork> not a major bug :)
[02:55:43] <samarjeet> Cork: yeah, it’s just a convention to use that
[03:45:12] <Captain_Haddock> If background-color cannot be animated without the jquery.color plugin, how does the highlight background animation work? Does it just play with the opacity?
[03:49:35] <Cork> "highlight background animation"?
[03:55:49] <K4T> hi
[03:57:22] <K4T> Can you recommend any good plugin for select controls? I want select control to look the same on all browsers and I want to have ability to change dropdown/up icon + some kind of placeholder attribute
[03:59:16] <kwladyka> hello, i am doing test A/B on site and i have to change some valu in menu as soon as this part of code appear in DOM. I dont want even wait to finish load whole site. Is it possible? Or mayby $(document).ready(function() is enough?
[04:00:33] <Cork> kwladyka: you would have to inject the <script> tag directly after the said element
[04:00:49] <Cork> if you want to run it that early
[04:05:12] <kwladyka> Cork i am unable to do that, i can only add additional scripts using google tag manager
[04:05:38] <kwladyka> mmm so mayby it doesnt make sesne anyway.... i have to use ready $(document).ready()
[04:07:18] <Captain_Haddock> Cork: The highlight *effect*'s background animation
[04:07:26] <Captain_Haddock> Cork: The highlight *effect*'s background-color animation
[04:20:58] <stangeland> If i have made a jquery plugin which has an internal state variable, and i have attached my plugin like this $('.clsselector').myplugin(), how do i then retrieve the internal state of myplugin later?
[04:21:31] <Cork> stangeland: depends on what you mean by internal state
[04:22:08] <stangeland> Cork, i have var filelist = [] inside my plugin
[04:22:20] <Cork> where inside the plugin?
[04:28:10] <stangeland> Cork, here: http://paste.ubuntu.com/10141643/ So in line 15, and i made a retriever fct. in line 30
[04:28:36] <stangeland> Cork, but im not sure how to invoke that retriever at a later point to obtain the filelist
[04:28:55] <Cork> stangeland: the variable is internal to the function execution
[04:29:06] <Cork> you can't access it outside
[04:29:17] <stangeland> Cork, hmm i see
[04:29:53] <Cork> you could attach it to this and make it accessable from dasbrowser
[04:30:07] <Cork> this.filelist = [];
[04:30:23] <Cork> $().data('dasbrowser').filelist
[04:31:17] <stangeland> ahhh, so i then just enter my selector, like: $('#mytreeelemen').data('dasbrowser').filelist ?
[04:31:27] <Macaveli> I have a collapsable span is it possible to make it accesible via keyboard
[04:31:41] <Cork> Macaveli: the tabindex attribute
[04:31:52] <Macaveli> I've added it
[04:31:57] <Macaveli> now I can tab to it
[04:32:01] <Macaveli> but not activate it
[04:32:31] <Cork> you would have to listen for keydown event
[04:32:38] <Cork> and do the collapsing from that
[04:36:47] <Brian> Hey
[04:36:54] <Brian> anyone who has experience with DataTables ?
[04:40:35] <Guest13293> hallo
[04:46:41] <Meir`> Guest13293, just ask the question, and if someone can he will help
[04:48:30] <stangeland> Cork, thank you :) it works
[05:33:19] <prohobo> okay
[05:33:24] <prohobo> i has a problem
[05:34:53] <prohobo> i need to pass global variables into a function
[05:34:57] <prohobo> and manipulate them
[05:35:02] <prohobo> like this: https://dpaste.de/sEOS
[05:35:20] <prohobo> of course this doesn't work, as the data inside the function gets manipulated, but the global variable stays the same
[05:35:40] <prohobo> how can i actually change the value of the global var while only passing a reference?
[05:37:39] <gtristan> prohobo, depends what it is, if its an object or an array, it's passed by reference
[05:37:53] <prohobo> hmm okay
[05:37:54] <gtristan> if its a number, its passed by value I think
[05:37:59] <prohobo> alright ty
[05:38:08] <prohobo> yeah ive just found a little article about it
[05:38:13] <prohobo> http://sirdarckcat.blogspot.com/2007/07/passing-reference-to-javascript.html
[05:38:24] <prohobo> so i can just put my vars into an object
[05:38:25] <prohobo> :D
[05:38:48] <gtristan> right, your globals themselves can sit in an object
[05:38:57] <gtristan> and pass the global object around
[05:39:15] <prohobo> thanks

[05:48:15] <jomofcw> Hello !
[05:48:56] <jomofcw> How can I handle the autoscroll on load to an anchor ? eg : I would like to modify the scroll, to move it 120px less than the normal/auto scroll.
[05:52:36] <MrTopless> Hi can anyone tell me why in this link available jplayer player: http://utena.policija.lt/klauskite_1/informuokite_apie_pazeidimus/ when you drag the progress bar it gets out of nowhere some wrapping div, and I'm using this example: https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/blob/master/examples/other/demo-07.html, Why it doesn't happen in demo version?
[05:53:29] <MrTopless> Is it jquery-ui version problem, is it jquery itself version problem. Or that mp4 fix is applied even though mp3 is played...
[05:54:07] <MrTopless> Or is it jplayer problem, when applying inline css changes in the wrong place.
[06:07:20] <MrTopless> Hi can anyone tell me why in this link available jplayer player: http://utena.policija.lt/klauskite_1/informuokite_apie_pazeidimus/ when you drag the progress bar it gets out of nowhere some wrapping div, and I'm using this example: https://github.com/happyworm/jPlayer/blob/master/examples/other/demo-07.html, Why it doesn't happen in demo version?

[06:30:16] <logikos> how do i select a subset of a resultset by index range .. for example if $('.item') has 100 items in its resultset and i want to select items 20-40 of that resultset ?
[06:30:21] <Tomasso> im using jquery ui, I update the UI based on an ajax request, but the styles do not refresh, and it doesnt render them. I tried .page .trigger('refresh') .css({}...)  to destroy the element and recrreated.. none of them works.. .any clues?
[06:30:24] <logikos> by its index number
[06:30:52] <logikos> obviously i could use nth-child but seems like there would be a better way
[06:31:09] <logikos> ?
[06:31:59] <logikos> hmmm, nevermind, looks like .slice() will do it
[06:32:51] <Junior> hello
[06:35:17] <BillCriswell> logikos: Yeah, slice is perfect for the job.
[06:35:28] <Junior> using the plugin inputmask.js v3.0.0-p7 i am able to force my users to insert data properly into a phone number field ('data-mask'=> '(999) 999-9999') . The trick now is that on the db i save only integers. When the page is loaded, data is not formatted according to the mask..If i click on the field data is formatted. I tried to do $("#UserPhone").click(); without any result. Any ideeas?
[06:41:30] <jomofcw> How can I handle the autoscroll on load to an anchor please ? eg : I would like to modify the scroll, to move it 120px less than the normal/auto scroll. And this from a new page loaded withan URL like this www.mydomain.tld/#myAnchor (and not from an already loaded page).
[06:42:07] <Cork> jomofcw: the simplest is to put the id on an element that much higher up
[06:42:17] <badasafish> Hi all, I've rolled out a new mobile menu on our responsive site but there are some parts of the site that conflict with it and breaks the js on the page, can somebody please offer some insight: http://www.doble-shop.co.uk/shop/shop-product-test-no-menu-working.php http://www.doble-shop.co.uk/shop/shop-product-test-menu-not-working.php
[06:42:32] <Cork> jomofcw: alternatively you would have to check the window.location.hash variable
[06:42:36] <BillCriswell> Junior: It seems like you have an odd option set.
[06:42:39] <Cork> and scroll to it
[06:43:59] <BillCriswell> Junior: http://jsfiddle.net/a5j0s5fh/1/ Just tried this and it worked as expected.

[06:45:34] <jomofcw> Hello cork !
[06:45:39] <Cork> o/
[06:46:03] <BillCriswell> Man, this is so much code for masking inputs.
[06:46:08] <Junior> BillCriswell i found out what i had to do, but isn't too good what i've done: $("#UserPhone").trigger("focus").blur();
[06:46:34] <jomofcw> Hm OK I understand what you mean... so, if I want something "smooth" I shall handle the window.location.hash and call a scrollTo on Document ready... is it right ?
[06:46:35] <BillCriswell> Junior: You shouldn't need to do that since what I just posted works.
[06:46:38] <Junior> BillCriswell that what i have tried also, but it didn't work on my conf, don'
[06:46:41] <Junior> BillCriswell that what i have tried also, but it didn't work on my conf, don't know why
[06:47:07] <Cork> jomofcw: yes
[06:47:43] <Junior> BillCriswell if i do what you put on fiddle my field becomes empty, beleive me that i've tried
[06:47:49] <Junior> beleive, sorry
[06:47:56] <Junior> believe , ffm
[06:52:04] <jomofcw> OK, I'll do that.

[06:58:18] <Junior> BillCriswell, thanks, i've lost more than an hour on this, can't waste more, need to figure out another time. Thank you!
[06:58:31] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[07:04:12] <jomofcw> It work well ! Thanks Cork ;).
[07:10:34] <badasafish> Is it appropriate to post a link here to my question on stackexchange?
[07:16:47] <Cork> badasafish: not really, you've already asked in one comunity, wait for the answer there
[07:17:41] <badasafish> Cork: OK, understood. Just keen to get a resolution
[07:32:51] <farn5w0rth> want to use clickable icons in a pop-over that opens on click. any suggestions on plugins/custom?
[07:44:22] <Meir`> to those that familiar with jquery ui sortable: is there a way to connect between lists on *one size*?
[07:44:41] <Meir`> e.g. to be able to move items from list1 to list2, but not the other way around
[07:44:53] <MajorWork> How would you advise making a test case for something with lots of dependable files and custom fonts , JSFiddles external resources don't work perfectly for me
[07:45:30] <Meir`> MajorWork, usually the issue isn't related to all the extra stuff
[07:45:39] <Meir`> so you can isolate only the action you can't do
[07:46:16] <MajorWork> Ive been trying, theres just sooo much css and js and all the click events are based off of icons i can't get to appear
[07:46:29] <MajorWork> so without the icons im stumped
[07:47:28] <Meir`> so please try your best to describe the issue
[07:48:05] <Meir`> you want icons to appear on click event?
[07:49:21] <MajorWork> Meir`, the icons have click events for example clicking the magnifying glass brings up an overlay, but i'm falling at the first hurdle in that i can't get jsfiddle to show the custom font icons
[07:53:55] <MajorWork> any recomendation on how to get the icons from the custom font in jsfiddle? I'm using icomoon
[07:57:52] <edrahn> Hi. I have a div that has a scroll bar on the left side that I have hover over the page.  When I dismis, then bring it back up again it retains the scroll bar position.
[07:58:08] <edrahn> I don't want it to, I tried using scrollTop(), but it doesn't do what I want.
[07:58:37] <edrahn> What do I need todo to have the scroll bar start at the top?
[07:59:57] <decx> scrollTop()
[08:00:38] <mezod> I have an <a>text <span></span></a> and I am trying to append a div in between the text and the span, why doesn't $( "<div>" ).appendTo( a.get([0]).firstChild ); work?
[08:00:39] <edrahn> decx: it doesn't work
[08:01:03] <decx> they method isnt the problem
[08:02:12] <decx> you cant appendTo a textnode mezod
[08:02:28] <mezod> oh
[08:02:38] <decx> something like $('a span').before('<div>') will do
[08:02:54] <mezod> yeah, i have more than one span in there though ;d
[08:03:09] <mezod> will try to prependTo the first span
[08:03:14] <decx> just add a bunch of classnames
[08:07:11] <mezod> decx: got it, thanks :)
[08:10:00] <w3gi> hallo, i have a menu that opens by click
[08:10:16] <w3gi> on a tablet or phone it close when i scroll down
[08:10:29] <w3gi> is there some trick to prevent that?
[08:12:38] <robertmaxrees> w3gi yep - detect if the user is scrolling instead of just clicking.
[08:14:37] <w3gi> i have a botton, and if you click on it it trigers the method show()
[08:15:02] <robertmaxrees> w3gi right - there is going to be other code for subsequently hiding the button
[08:16:43] <w3gi> click the button again to close
[08:16:59] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ w3gi
[08:17:00] <b-ot> w3gi: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[08:22:45] <ragas> im submitting a form via ajax, and getting a mime type response error. "Resource interpreted as script, but transferred with type text/html". i have no control over the server, so i cant change the way the server responds.
[08:23:16] <Kage> why does jQuery's ajax not support the progress event :(
[08:24:00] <robertmaxrees> ragas that's more of a warning,not an error.  you shouldn't have any problems otherwise.
[08:24:46] <robertmaxrees> Kage it's semi-simple to wire in yourself for the browsers that do support it.
[08:25:25] <Kage> robertmaxrees: Hmmm... does ajax add a way to get the xhr object without creating your own?
[08:25:54] <robertmaxrees> http://www.dave-bond.com/blog/2010/01/JQuery-ajax-progress-HMTL5/
[08:26:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[08:26:32] <Kage> robertmaxrees: yeah, but I don't want to have to create my own xhr events
[08:26:38] <Kage> I mean... objects
[08:26:45] <robertmaxrees> you're... not really.
[08:27:12] <Kage> xhr.addEventListener("progress", function(evt)
[08:27:15] <robertmaxrees> right
[08:27:21] <Kage> that is the only actually part required
[08:27:56] <Kage> Oh I see
[08:28:01] <Kage> I just have to create it
[08:28:02] <robertmaxrees> oh you're objecting to having to do new XMLHttpRequest?
[08:28:19] <Kage> No, I thought xhr required me to pass in URL and data
[08:28:38] <robertmaxrees> also: http://stackoverflow.com/a/22946655 this might be helpful.
[08:29:28] <robertmaxrees> and i'm guessing part of the issue jquery doesn't handle this for you is because of the older browser support question - what's the fallback in the event the browser doesn't support it?
[08:29:50] <Kage> Meh, just don't invoke the function if it isn't supported
[08:30:15] <robertmaxrees> then people complain that a documented feature isn't working ;)
[08:30:24] <Kage> put it in the docs?
[08:30:26] <Kage> Or fake it
[08:30:29] <robertmaxrees> you'd be surprised how many people don't read the docs.
[08:30:40] <robertmaxrees> and never fake ajax progress imo.
[08:30:54] <Kage> :P
[08:31:06] <Kage> ok... do an estimated
[08:31:17] <robertmaxrees> you can't for browsers that don't support it.
[08:31:21] <robertmaxrees> it's really messy.
[08:31:42] <Kage> (requestSize / connectionSpeed) * timePassed
[08:32:05] <robertmaxrees> right - so how do you get the first two?
[08:32:21] <Kage> requestSize is the easy to get...
[08:32:38] <Kage> connectionSpeed... is harder
[08:32:53] <robertmaxrees> bingo - now set everything up to work in IE8/9
[08:33:09] <Kage> You could maybe use something like past requests
[08:33:27] <Kage> to make a guess
[08:33:39] <robertmaxrees> not really - that relies on you having past requests stored somewhere to accomplish that.
[08:34:19] <multi_io> is there an easy way to veto a change event on a select input?
[08:34:32] <robertmaxrees> multi_io e.preventDefault() within the event handler.
[08:34:33] <Kage> multi_io. preventDefault()
[08:35:08] <multi_io> ah! thanks, I'll try that.
[08:35:17] <robertmaxrees> Kage i totally get where you're coming from though - i'd suggest maybe popping a thing into github and see where it goes.
[08:35:38] <Kage> https://decadecity.net/blog/2013/05/08/using-javascript-to-estimate-connection-speed
[08:35:45] <Kage> it isn't totally impossible
[08:35:51] <Kage> may not be worth the effort
[08:36:10] <robertmaxrees> it's not necessarily about effort and more about satisfying all the browser support.
[08:36:35] <Kage> IE6?
[08:36:51] <Kage> at somepoint, we need to drop support
[08:37:09] <robertmaxrees> 2.x does drop support, and the compat branch might drop it at some point.
[08:37:15] <robertmaxrees> IE9 is also still at hing.
[08:37:22] <robertmaxrees> *a thing
[08:38:05] <Kage> isn't IE(currentVersion - 2) always a hing?
[08:38:21] <robertmaxrees> http://jquery.com/browser-support/
[08:38:33] <robertmaxrees> and it really depends.
[08:38:48] <Kage> 1.6 supports 6+
[08:38:50] <Kage> shit...
[08:38:55] <robertmaxrees> 1.x supports 6+
[08:39:02] <robertmaxrees> meaning 1.11.2 supports it.
[08:39:47] <Kage> luckily I require canvas, meaning anything pre IE9 is out of the question from the start
[08:40:38] <robertmaxrees> i have to support 8 and above for my stuff.
[08:40:58] <Kage> I wish I could drop IE9
[08:41:09] <Kage> I have about 3 ugly hacks for IE9
[08:41:37] <robertmaxrees> 8 is the last one I care about for now.  9 I can deal with since i have access to most of the JS methods I want there.
[08:42:14] <Kage> IE9 lack of support for fileupload via ajax is annoying
[08:42:30] <robertmaxrees> the sort of work i'm doing doesn't really require it.
[08:42:39] <Kage> Also, lack of support for filereader
[08:43:03] <Kage> Also, lack of support for ajax progress
[08:43:50] <Kage> Chrome pasted 50% market share on desktop/laptops alone in Nov 14
[08:44:03] <Kage> more like 70% if you include the mobile market
[08:44:42] <Kage> when Chrome gets to like... 90%, I hope M$ gets put into the same hole Firefox, chrome and all the other browsers have been put into for years
[08:44:49] <robertmaxrees> lol I use firefox ;)
[08:44:57] <robertmaxrees> and spartan might change things.
[08:45:07] <Kage> spartan?
[08:45:14] <robertmaxrees> the next browser from MS.
[08:45:25] <Kage> is that the codename for the IE TP?
[08:45:52] <robertmaxrees> it's the name they're using for the IE they're putting into windows 10.
[08:52:45] <ExtraSteve> For the jquery validation plugin, I have: wrapper: "li"
[08:53:02] <ExtraSteve> Which works, it puts each error in an <li>
[08:53:11] <ExtraSteve> But it doesn't wrap them in a <ul>...
[08:53:30] <ExtraSteve> Anyone know how to do this?
[08:54:09] <ExtraSteve> I suppose I could use errorLabelContainer
[08:54:56] <robertmaxrees> it's been forever since i last worked with jquery validate.
[08:57:25] <MajorWork> is there no console output on jsfiddle?
[08:57:48] <ExtraSteve> robertmaxrees: same
[08:57:48] <robertmaxrees> it's your browser's
[08:57:53] <ExtraSteve> And every time I do, I hate it :p
[08:58:22] <robertmaxrees> ExtraSteve i've considered writing my own a few times.
[08:59:56] <ExtraSteve> haha, every time I use jquery validate, I think the same thing
[09:00:03] <ExtraSteve> "I should just write my own..."
[09:00:06] <ExtraSteve> And I never do :
[09:00:09] <ExtraSteve> :p
[09:00:17] <robertmaxrees> i did once-ish.  wasn't really a plugin, just a validator.
[09:00:28] <MajorWork> my predicament is with a behind the scenes array and thats a bit of  a spanner in the works if i can't get a console output from jsfiddle
[09:00:32] <robertmaxrees> but it wouldn't be too hard to make it into a plugin.
[09:00:45] <robertmaxrees> MajorWork you just use the one with your browser.
[09:02:54] <MajorWork> robertmaxrees, it doesnt appear to have the variables from within my testcase to output
[09:03:04] <robertmaxrees> MajorWork huh?
[09:03:17] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to access them from inside of the console?
[09:03:21] <MajorWork> yeah
[09:03:34] <robertmaxrees> ah - jsfiddle runs everything in an iframe, so you don't have access like that.
[09:03:49] <robertmaxrees> usually you just console.log() out things that you need.
[09:04:40] <MajorWork> My question is going to be that my behind array is being populated by dropdown1 and dropdown2 and i only want it to be populated by dropdown1
[09:04:54] <MajorWork> I suppose i'll just make somewhere print the array for testing
[09:05:00] <robertmaxrees> just paste the fiddle.
[09:05:16] <MajorWork> im currently going through and anonymising it
[09:05:24] <MajorWork> as it contained some confidential information
[09:05:27] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[09:05:41] <MajorWork> I think its dummy data but its in the correct format so im just breaking it
[09:41:56] <Mark_2> im bored
[09:42:00] <Mark_2> anybody alive?
[09:42:59] <MajorWork> im alive
[09:43:04] <Mark_2> good.
[09:43:09] <Mark_2> how are you doing?
[09:43:11] <MajorWork> did i pass the test?
[09:43:14] <MajorWork> Im doing well
[09:43:17] <Mark_2> what test ? lol
[09:43:18] <MajorWork> 15 minutes untill home time
[09:43:36] <MajorWork> I need a better system for handling problems with my code
[09:43:51] <MajorWork> are you a developer Mark_2
[09:44:14] <robertmaxrees> i hate having to do random restarts.
[09:44:38] <Mark_2> nope.
[09:44:44] <Mark_2> why did you?
[09:45:23] <robertmaxrees> MajorWork are you familiar with step debuggers?
[09:45:56] <MajorWork> I'm familiar with debuggers , is a step debugger when you can put breakpoints and stuff ?
[09:46:04] <robertmaxrees> yep
[09:47:07] <MajorWork> when ever i find an issue , i start adding ID's and incrementing pointless variables by 1. Generally creating a workaround i didn't need
[09:47:19] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want a step debugger for.
[09:47:23] <MajorWork> my while looping is awful
[09:47:27] <robertmaxrees> it lets to test variables within scopes.
[09:47:41] <robertmaxrees> learn to use things like foreach instead of loops, too.
[09:48:24] <MajorWork> hmmm this is good food for thought
[09:48:55] <robertmaxrees> also see if you wind up having the same kinds of problems over and over - that can clue you into something you might need to learn.
[09:50:10] <MajorWork> I quite often phrase my questions wrong. It reminds me of that guy in irobot
[09:50:24] <MajorWork> "I'm sorry my responses are limited, you must ask the right questions"
[09:50:43] <robertmaxrees> do you know any programming languages?  or is JS your first "outing", as it were?
[09:50:44] <MajorWork> in terms of googling to see if anybodies encoutered the exact same issue
[09:51:21] <robertmaxrees> 9/10 it won't be the exact same.
[09:51:49] <robertmaxrees> there'll be a basic problem that's shared, but the abstracted version might be different.
[09:51:50] <robertmaxrees> brb
[09:52:53] <Mark_2> hmm
[09:53:21] <MajorWork> I would say I have strong grasp on HTML, CSS & PHP although I recently found out my take on HTML is not up to todays standards, I can do alot of things with javascript. Erm Python I only started toying with last year but i've made alot of stuff with it. Ive done some beginner stuff with a lot of languages like java and vb script at uni
[09:53:36] <Mark_2> you good at php?
[09:54:07] <MajorWork> Pretty good
[09:54:13] <Mark_2> i wish i could hire some of the talented people here in the irc chat and make a good comapny out of it
[09:54:28] <MajorWork> I got called in to assist with some tomcat configuration and that was a bit over my head but i knew the syntax and was able to contribute
[09:54:40] <Mark_2> good for you.
[09:54:44] <Mark_2> im stil llearning most of it.
[09:54:58] <Mark_2> jquery and greensock, javascirpt and css etc
[09:55:03] <MajorWork> you 2, what are you working on atm?
[09:55:37] <Mark_2> hmm me? i don’t work at anywhere.
[09:55:37] <MajorWork> I thought ajax was a seperate thing untill this weekend, reading over the jquery section in a javascript book
[09:55:46] <MajorWork> Personal projects?
[09:55:50] <Mark_2> hm,
[09:55:51] <Mark_2> um,,
[09:56:02] <Mark_2> im just learning how to make my own websites.
[09:56:07] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/page_FIsv96
[09:57:05] <Mark_2> speaking of which, i don’t know why the window won’t drag
[09:57:07] <MajorWork> Im working on something on the weekends too but i need to stop linking to it, its so unfinished
[09:57:16] <robertmaxrees> back
[09:57:21] <Mark_2> hey robert.
[09:57:24] <Mark_2> remember me?
[09:57:33] <robertmaxrees> wish i could say "yes" ;)
[09:57:45] <robertmaxrees> i barely remember what i ate for breakfast.
[09:57:51] <Mark_2> aren’t you the guy who commented on my stockoverflow?
[09:57:59] <Mark_2> or did i confuse you with someone else
[09:58:00] <Mark_2> idk
[09:58:10] <robertmaxrees> i've commented on a few SOs.  no clue what you're talking about.
[09:58:24] <Omar-> crapoverflow
[09:58:28] <MajorWork> robertmaxrees, the more i learn the more there is to learn
[09:58:28] <Omar-> :P
[09:58:48] <MajorWork> see you tomorrow o/
[09:58:54] <MajorWork> peas out
[09:58:54] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[09:58:57] <Mark_2> nvm it was Agamemnus
[09:59:02] <Mark_2> but i did see you somewhere.
[09:59:03] <Mark_2> bye
[09:59:08] <Mark_2> anyways.
[09:59:24] <Mark_2> what are you guys upto in this fine morning
[09:59:31] <Mark_2> *fine night rather
[09:59:43] <robertmaxrees> morning here ;)
[09:59:57] <Omar-> evening here 19:00h
[10:00:04] <robertmaxrees> working from him before i head into the office today.
[10:00:11] <Mark_2> 3:00 in the morning here.
[10:00:27] <robertmaxrees> 10:00 here
[10:01:59] <robertmaxrees> *from home.  the apartment complex i share a fence with is doing tree maintenance and they told me they'd be taking care of a few problems for me.
[10:04:12] <Mark_2> ha
[10:04:17] <Mark_2> im tired as hell
[10:04:25] <Mark_2> it’s *3 AM
[10:04:29] <robertmaxrees> being up that lae will do that to a person.
[10:05:44] <Mark_2> wehre are you from?
[10:05:50] <robertmaxrees> california
[10:05:58] <Mark_2> ah
[10:06:05] <Mark_2> spent there two years.
[10:06:11] <robertmaxrees> whereat?
[10:07:02] <Mark_2> LA county
[10:07:09] <Mark_2> sanbernardino
[10:07:12] <Mark_2> citrus
[10:07:14] <Mark_2> azusa
[10:07:20] <robertmaxrees> ah, the opposite end of the state to me.
[10:07:26] <Mark_2> i see.
[10:07:34] <Mark_2> now that im back in Korea
[10:08:11] <checkit> Hey guys... what is the correct ray to form the push  method on line 10? http://jsfiddle.net/kfvouy1b/
[10:08:11] <Mark_2> a big great world - rockstar
[10:08:14] <Mark_2> this is a great song.
[10:08:15] <robertmaxrees> it'd take me about 9 hours to drive to san bernardino.  and interesting.
[10:08:26] <w3gi> hallo
[10:08:31] <w3gi> http://jsfiddle.net/506ybLgp/10/
[10:09:00] <robertmaxrees> checkit use map instead.
[10:09:41] <w3gi> i have that code on a webpage and it works but if i use a mobile device (tablet or phone) and i need to scroll down to see the rest of the menu then the menu close automatically
[10:09:58] <robertmaxrees> checkit actually, no, because you want to add properties to an object.
[10:10:05] <robertmaxrees> that's not the right way to use an array.
[10:10:51] <robertmaxrees> checkit http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/kfvouy1b/1/
[10:11:00] <robertmaxrees> arrays can't have named keys, but plain objects can.
[10:11:40] <w3gi> robertmaxrees, some idea?
[10:12:13] <checkit> I need it to be an object then robertmaxrees. I have to maintain a key value pair.
[10:12:23] <robertmaxrees> checkit look at the fiddle i sent you :)
[10:12:59] <robertmaxrees> w3gi don't use slideToggle();
[10:13:00] <checkit> Oops, didn't see that. Thank you.
[10:13:19] <robertmaxrees> be explicit and use slideDown()/slideUp() and use the conditionally.
[10:15:00] <robertmaxrees> w3gi also, you want an e.stopPropagation() call on those menu items i'm guestting, but that's a guess.
[10:15:10] <robertmaxrees> wait no you don't.
[10:15:20] <Mark_2> do you mind if i ask how old you are
[10:15:21] <Mark_2> ?
[10:15:24] <robertmaxrees> 27
[10:15:44] <Mark_2> wow
[10:15:49] <Mark_2> good times.
[10:15:53] <robertmaxrees> ?
[10:16:09] <Mark_2> having a moment of your days?
[10:16:18] <robertmaxrees> not following.
[10:16:31] <robertmaxrees> w3gi i can't replicate your problem with the fiddle.  are you including everything?
[10:16:32] <Mark_2> having good days?
[10:16:37] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 oh, absolutely.
[10:16:44] <Mark_2> good.
[10:16:51] <w3gi> robertmaxrees, i dont have the problem on a PC just on a tablet
[10:17:08] <w3gi> and slideDown dont help
[10:17:08] <robertmaxrees> w3gi right - when i emulate a tablet or phone i don't have the issue.
[10:17:20] <robertmaxrees> so you're not including something.
[10:17:33] <w3gi> and what i need to include?
[10:17:40] <robertmaxrees> everything to replicate the bug.
[10:17:43] <w3gi> i have jquery included and thats it
[10:18:04] <robertmaxrees> chrome has built-in mobile emulation fwiw
[10:19:36] <robertmaxrees> w3gi mobile emulation on that link doesn't replicate the problem.
[10:21:12] <Mark_2> hmm
[10:21:30] <Mark_2> javascript and jquery are difficult to learn.
[10:21:35] <robertmaxrees> not at all imo.
[10:21:43] <robertmaxrees> what sort of programming experience do you have?
[10:21:50] <Mark_2> none.
[10:21:52] <Mark_2> just html5 and css3
[10:22:02] <robertmaxrees> ah, that can take some mental overhead :)
[10:22:06] <Mark_2> i just started learninga bout jquery and ajax.
[10:22:19] <robertmaxrees> diving in head first!
[10:22:23] <Mark_2> yeah, i started designing when i was 8 or so
[10:22:36] <Mark_2> but then i used phtoshop and dreamweaver to do it
[10:22:47] <Mark_2> coding in html5 and css3, jquery is kind of new to me
[10:23:07] <Mark_2> but im starting getting things.
[10:23:42] <robertmaxrees> javascript and jquery are pretty easy.  jquery does a nice job of abstracting away some of the more painful parts of the DOM.
[10:23:57] <Mark_2> yes.
[10:23:57] <robertmaxrees> javascript is a neat little language, especially once you start really grokking some core concepts.
[10:24:15] <Mark_2> how do you think of this site? http://www.alessioatzeni.com/mac-osx-lion-css3/#all
[10:24:40] <w3gi> robertmaxrees, i cant activate the mobile emulation in my chrome
[10:24:53] <robertmaxrees> w3gi sure you can.  open the dev tools and do it from there :)
[10:24:56] <w3gi> anyway... i see that on 3 different devices
[10:25:11] <w3gi> iphone, android + chrome, tablet
[10:25:13] <robertmaxrees> w3gi dunno what to tell you then.  i'm guessing that you're having an event bubbling problem.
[10:25:33] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 hrm.  it's interesting, though i'm rarely a fan of loading screens.
[10:25:34] <w3gi> you dont have a phome?
[10:25:40] <Mark_2> yea
[10:25:59] <robertmaxrees> w3gi i sure do - i'm also working right now ;)
[10:25:59] <w3gi> smartphone... would you test it please with that
[10:26:21] <robertmaxrees> why not hook up remote debugging yourself?
[10:26:30] <w3gi> if you open the menu it's ok but if you scroll down it close
[10:27:17] <w3gi> what you mean with that?
[10:27:47] <robertmaxrees> you can hook your phone up to your computer and use that to remotely debug the browser.
[10:30:56] <w3gi> never did that - no idea that works and no idea how to do it
[10:31:03] <robertmaxrees> then look it up :)
[10:31:11] <robertmaxrees> great learning opportunity and it'll help you fix your problem.
[10:31:32] <w3gi> the problem must be with the tapping on the creen
[10:31:35] <w3gi> screen
[10:31:59] <robertmaxrees> right - so you'd set a breakpoint in your step debugger, tap the screen, and watch what happens from there.
[10:32:19] <w3gi> linux can do that?
[10:32:26] <robertmaxrees> chrome can.
[10:34:10] <robertmaxrees> either way, the fiddle you shared shouldn't exhibit the behavior you're describing, so it's real hard for me to help.
[10:34:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to guess that you've got some kind of errant event binding that's getting hit via bubbling.
[10:39:17] <w3gi> chrome dont know my device
[10:39:53] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/remote-debugging
[10:40:22] <w3gi> no divice found
[10:40:40] <robertmaxrees> are you using android or iOS to troubleshoot?
[10:41:20] <w3gi> just have android here
[10:41:37] <robertmaxrees> then follow the instructions at the link i provided to set up remote debugging :)
[10:41:43] <robertmaxrees> it's pretty neat and really useful.
[10:42:00] <w3gi> i did
[10:42:13] <w3gi> it dont accept my lenovo phone
[10:42:39] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how else to help you, then.
[10:42:59] <robertmaxrees> it should work just fine.  might need to install some drivers to get it to work properly.
[10:43:18] <w3gi> linux
[10:43:26] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't matter.
[10:44:26] <w3gi> lsusb see it as lenovo-phone
[10:44:31] <w3gi> but chrome dont
[10:45:02] <w3gi> maybe it need admin-rights wich i dont have
[10:45:12] <robertmaxrees> there's an entire section on that site that guides you through the process.
[10:46:37] <Tomashe> Hey guys, i wondering if i can create some kind of  way for loading files from user local files somehow?
[10:47:38] <w3gi> No devices detected.
[10:48:03] <robertmaxrees> w3gi repeating yourself isn't going to accomplish anything :)
[10:48:29] <w3gi> i dont even get the dialogue on android
[10:48:44] <w3gi> and usb-debugging is activated
[10:48:46] <robertmaxrees> there's an entire section of that site dedicated to troubleshooting...
[10:51:25] <w3gi> and i try all
[10:51:36] <w3gi> latest version, driver for linux dont exist
[10:51:41] <w3gi> usb debugging is on
[10:51:52] <w3gi> i really hate that web 2.0 crap
[10:51:57] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:52:20] <robertmaxrees> your issue here is the driver - iirc you need to get a generic one, not the vendor-specific one.
[10:53:26] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, i need to be able to replicate the bug, which I haven't been able to so far.
[10:53:54] <w3gi> i also cant on a PC
[10:54:11] <w3gi> i just have that bug on a tablet or phone
[10:54:47] <robertmaxrees> your site only gives the a "it works" message on my phone.
[10:55:09] <w3gi> add a www.
[10:55:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that looks like a bad event binding somewhere.
[10:56:23] <w3gi> without www it's routed wrong... dont ask me why... our it-guy did it so
[10:58:57] <robertmaxrees> $(".navLink").click(function() {}) this is likely your problem.
[11:00:07] <w3gi> i remove it
[11:00:12] <w3gi> and have the same effect
[11:00:31] <robertmaxrees> weird
[11:00:49] <robertmaxrees> have you, like, tried removing things to see what's causing it to happen?
[11:01:16] <w3gi> there are just a few functions
[11:01:25] <robertmaxrees> welcome to debugging and troubleshooting.
[11:04:15] <w3gi> $(window).resize(function(){ is the problem
[11:04:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd check to see if it's not the scroll instead.
[11:05:11] <robertmaxrees> or the mobileMode bool
[11:05:24] <w3gi> yep but that web 2.0 crab sucks - it cost me more time then our cataloge-automatic-layout-script wich generates by click a 600 pages cataloue :D
[11:05:43] <robertmaxrees> what "web 2.0 crap"?
[11:05:50] <robertmaxrees> because new stuff is pretty legit.
[11:06:18] <w3gi> i know
[11:06:39] <BillCriswell> web 2.0 is so 2010
[11:09:19] <w3gi> i dont care for me it's waste of time
[11:09:24] <robertmaxrees> wut
[11:09:39] <robertmaxrees> it's not a waste of time for anyone - you're using it whether you know it or not.
[11:10:42] <w3gi> robertmaxrees, in my case yes - i have 200 things on the desktop wich effect important things
[11:11:04] <robertmaxrees> if your'e using jquery, you're using "web 2.)' technologies.
[11:11:10] <robertmaxrees> *web 2.0
[11:11:11] <w3gi> now i search why the fu** navibar slides in for half day
[11:11:38] <w3gi> i would never use jQuery or js if someone would listen me ;-)
[11:11:48] <robertmaxrees> why?
[11:11:55] <w3gi> time-loss
[11:12:06] <w3gi> sorry, i my opinion
[11:12:06] <robertmaxrees> huh.  okay.
[11:12:15] <NoiseEee> w3gi: its hard to make sense of literally anything you say
[11:12:19] <NoiseEee> but good luck!
[11:12:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:12:48] <w3gi> if you make a web-app OK
[11:13:11] <w3gi> but for a "normal" website it's in my opinion just increase of development time
[11:13:29] <robertmaxrees> it all depends on what you need your site to do.
[11:13:40] <robertmaxrees> i don't have a "webapp" necessarily and still find it very useful.
[11:13:46] <w3gi> i have software-systems and they generate websites, catalogues, etc.
[11:14:06] <w3gi> in that case i loose much to much time on that small issue
[11:14:52] <w3gi> bytheway i have it - i cancel the resice-funtion wich should just animate the hiding when flipping from portrait to landcscape
[11:15:18] <robertmaxrees> that's because you're doing things like implicit opening/closing of that nav and kind of unusual event bindings.
[11:15:26] <w3gi> dont get me wrong but if you make a webmailer, or something lik that
[11:15:42] <w3gi> it's nice because the site behave like a programm
[11:16:07] <robertmaxrees> or any site where you want to do anything dynamic...
[11:16:08] <w3gi> for a website it's in my opinion to much efford for to less effect
[11:16:33] <robertmaxrees> for our site it winds up being almost necessary.
[11:16:37] <w3gi> dynamic can use php
[11:16:46] <robertmaxrees> right - server site.
[11:16:56] <robertmaxrees> *side.  now i need to swap things out after pageload.
[11:17:00] <w3gi> the net is today so fast a complete reload dont is a problem
[11:17:15] <robertmaxrees> unless you're on mobile or catering to users with slow connections ;)
[11:18:22] <w3gi> thats a philosophic discussion but i dont see a big issue in loading the footer and banner again
[11:18:30] <w3gi> for that a browser have a cache
[11:18:35] <w3gi> it looks nicer
[11:18:44] <robertmaxrees> i don't think it looks nicer at all.
[11:19:15] <w3gi> ok, but that create a ton of additional possible issues
[11:19:24] <robertmaxrees> not if you're paying attention.
[11:19:45] <robertmaxrees> server-side code can create a ton of additonal possible issues, too.
[11:19:45] <w3gi> sure, you can pay attention how much you like
[11:20:13] <w3gi> if M$ create a new version IE you may be fucked
[11:20:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:20:30] <w3gi> why nope?
[11:20:33] <robertmaxrees> not really, becuase tht'd cause end users to jump ship to chrome or FF.
[11:20:39] <robertmaxrees> which has happened in the past.
[11:20:50] <w3gi> not in B2B
[11:20:53] <w3gi> ;-)
[11:20:56] <w3gi> 75% IE
[11:20:59] <robertmaxrees> even then.
[11:21:10] <robertmaxrees> because those companies are locked to specific versions on IE.
[11:21:12] <w3gi> and that makes JS suck 2 x more :D
[11:21:17] <robertmaxrees> i disagree.
[11:21:50] <w3gi> sure and you start testing from win XP - win 8 with 5 versions of IE
[11:21:57] <w3gi> CSS-hacks, etc.
[11:22:10] <w3gi> all time consuming
[11:22:14] <robertmaxrees> nah we test IE8 and above without XP.
[11:22:25] <w3gi> look nicer, i aggree
[11:22:37] <robertmaxrees> the folks using older IE give us money. those are the platforms worthwhile to us.
[11:22:38] <w3gi> but i am more the practic type of person
[11:22:41] <jennyRacha> Hey guys, is there something that would stop jQuery from loading JSON files from another domain on IE 8/9? I'm not getting any errors.
[11:22:52] <robertmaxrees> jennyRacha check your network panel.
[11:22:57] <w3gi> fu** the look, the content counts not how it's presentated
[11:23:14] <robertmaxrees> presentation can matter a whole lot.  welcome to marketing ;)
[11:23:18] <jennyRacha> robertmaxrees: i see none of the json files in the network panel
[11:23:29] <jennyRacha> whereas i do in other browsers
[11:23:33] <robertmaxrees> jennyRacha even after reload/retrigger of the ajax call?
[11:24:00] <robertmaxrees> what does the .fail() callback tell you?
[11:24:39] <robertmaxrees> you might need to set the contentType and set crossDomain: true
[11:31:52] <Buzzyboy> I agree. Presentation is very important.
[11:34:59] <w3gi> i tell you cant polish shit
[11:35:13] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:39:37] <w3gi> and why jQuery? what does that have common with the presentation - just by the way
[11:39:52] <robertmaxrees> not sure i understand the question.
[11:39:53] <robertmaxrees> why use it?
[11:40:00] <w3gi> html + css is the presentation
[11:40:11] <robertmaxrees> we're not talking about presentation layer.
[11:40:24] <robertmaxrees> we're talking about the end result - how, say, products are presented to the end user.
[11:40:32] <NoiseEee> jennyRacha: yeah, you don't get to load files from another domain via ajax
[11:40:46] <w3gi> but for that you dont need js
[11:40:58] <robertmaxrees> w3gi in some cases, it makes the presentation a LOT cleaner.
[11:41:01] <w3gi> php + html + css does the job as well
[11:41:04] <NoiseEee> w3gi: some people in 2015 actually expect a website that offers interactivity - ie: you can do shit with it
[11:41:06] <jennyRacha> NoiseEee: just in ie 8/9?
[11:41:07] <robertmaxrees> php :(
[11:41:14] <NoiseEee> jennyRacha: no, every browser
[11:41:54] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy @ jennyRacha
[11:42:01] <robertmaxrees> w3gi we have a lot of cases where products need to be configured before the user can buy them. Instead of forcing them through extra pages and making the experience worse, we have them do it on the page.
[11:42:20] <w3gi> sure...
[11:42:31] <w3gi> and one option can be combinated with another
[11:42:49] <w3gi> js reset a field and the user is confused
[11:42:50] <robertmaxrees> validation, price updates, and other things are driven via javascript because it makes for a better end user experience.
[11:42:57] <robertmaxrees> js doesn't reset anything.
[11:43:01] <NoiseEee> w3gi: you can either design websites as you want to, or you can design them as people expect.
[11:43:06] <robertmaxrees> ^ this
[11:43:11] <NoiseEee> w3gi: if you're looking for a career, you had better follow option #2
[11:43:22] <w3gi> i do such calculation tools mainly
[11:43:35] <robertmaxrees> making users trudge through multiple pages to do trivial tasks is going to end up costing you
[11:43:37] <w3gi> and i have not one positive experience with JS
[11:43:42] <w3gi> sorry
[11:43:52] <NoiseEee> w3gi: good luck! :)
[11:44:20] <w3gi> all clients till now step back, and have a 10-15% better conversation rate
[11:44:42] <w3gi> it depends always how complex ist it
[11:44:51] <w3gi> a shirt-designer is great for js
[11:44:57] <robertmaxrees> good JS isn't complex.
[11:45:17] <robertmaxrees> you can build highly interactive, JS-heavy sites without using complex code.
[11:45:37] <w3gi> but my tools are complex
[11:45:46] <w3gi> one of them have 37 config-steps
[11:45:56] <w3gi> and each one effect the next ones
[11:45:57] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like the issue, then.  my tools are very basic.
[11:46:37] <w3gi> do that in js and of the user change something the validator reports 24 issues ...
[11:46:53] <w3gi> thats no user experience - they get just crazy
[11:46:55] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like a design concern.
[11:47:01] <robertmaxrees> not a javascript concern.
[11:47:10] <w3gi> no, that products are so
[11:47:35] <w3gi> and the rules are since 200 years the same
[11:47:45] <w3gi> it's just a complex b2b product
[11:48:04] <robertmaxrees> you lost me again.
[11:48:28] <w3gi> and the rules are defined by country-laws, machine-spezifications, pricing, and 20 other things
[11:49:14] <robertmaxrees> we have similar limitations :)
[11:49:25] <w3gi> no mather... i just tell js is a nice toy for application-like websites
[11:49:41] <w3gi> but in 90% of the cases it's just not necesary
[11:49:50] <robertmaxrees> lol good luck mano :)
[11:50:32] <jennyRacha> NoiseEee: why then do my cors requests work on other browsers?
[11:50:50] <robertmaxrees> jennyRacha did you try setting crossDomain: true, ?
[11:51:31] <NoiseEee> jennyRacha: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2013/10/28/sending-a-cors-request-in-ie.aspx
[11:51:53] <robertmaxrees> woops
[11:52:18] <jennyRacha> ah! thanks i will try this
[11:52:36] <robertmaxrees> ah yes, the old ie ajax thing.
[11:55:53] <mirazi_heket> hello, how can i add data to last row of table (lets say 1 variable)?
[11:56:57] <BillCriswell> mirazi_heket: Add data where?
[11:57:20] <robertmaxrees> "to last row of table" doesn't make much sense - are you trying to edit/add a <td>?
[11:57:21] <mirazi_heket> to the last row of table (tr)
[11:57:28] <mirazi_heket> yes
[11:57:34] <robertmaxrees> which one?
[11:57:36] <robertmaxrees> edit or add?
[11:57:36] <mirazi_heket> more precisely make 3x td in tr
[11:57:40] <mirazi_heket> add
[11:57:54] <robertmaxrees> you can .append() your three td elements
[11:57:55] <BillCriswell> So add another row with X columns?
[11:58:05] <jennyRacha> so the solution is to use the plugin?
[11:58:19] <mirazi_heket> its appended, just not want to modify only last row
[11:58:34] <mirazi_heket> $("tr").append("<td>"+id+"</td>");
[11:58:41] <mirazi_heket> that adds data to every row
[11:58:53] <robertmaxrees> check out .last()
[11:59:04] <robertmaxrees> you probably want $('tr').last().append()
[11:59:17] <mirazi_heket> ow nice, thanks
[11:59:17] <BillCriswell> .last().after()
[11:59:42] <robertmaxrees> the tr already exists it looks like.
[11:59:45] <BillCriswell> Oh
[11:59:51] <BillCriswell> Missed that detail.
[12:00:07] <BillCriswell> Should be doing that all in one shot probably.
[12:00:20] <mirazi_heket> working
[12:00:25] <mirazi_heket> $("tr").last().append("<td>"+id+"</td>");
[12:00:27] <mirazi_heket> thanks a lot
[12:01:13] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting into deferreds and promises a lot today.
[12:01:51] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I can usually get them working, but I still don't feel like I understand them fully.
[12:02:23] <robertmaxrees> i feel like i'm really grokking the basics, but i'm falling into the trap of making things too complicated.
[12:02:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/hmxa8ryy/5/ this little exercize really helped me.
[12:04:09] <BillCriswell> Yeah. I did one with loops that helped it make sense to me.
[12:04:18] <robertmaxrees> ooh that's another good way
[12:04:54] <robertmaxrees> the whole concept is a little funky, but now that I'm getting the whole "resolved or rejected once" thing internalized i'm getting why it's all so useful.
[12:05:21] <BillCriswell> Yeah I hear ya
[12:08:26] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: I always feel like I'm not following something right haha
[12:08:37] <BillCriswell> then shoky yells at me.
[12:09:32] <robertmaxrees> and then you feel like you suddenly get it?
[12:09:59] <mirazi_heket> now silly thing: i want to change font inside table
[12:10:06] <robertmaxrees> mirazi_heket css.
[12:10:09] <jennyRacha> Hey guys, thanks for the help, adding that plugin totally fixed the problem!
[12:10:35] <mirazi_heket> okay then
[12:10:37] <jennyRacha> Last thing I ran into is that I'm getting the same Access Denied error as before on a shim file i'm loading
[12:10:52] <jennyRacha> it's a ".htc" file that only gets loaded in ie 8
[12:10:53] <mirazi_heket> $("table").css("fontFamily","Verdana");
[12:10:54] <BillCriswell> mirazi_heket: and not jQuery .css, just toggle a class on the table to make the font-size larger.
[12:11:07] <mirazi_heket> done
[12:11:08] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Yes.
[12:11:11] <robertmaxrees> mirazi_heket don't use jquery for something like that.
[12:11:16] <robertmaxrees> just use plain CSS.
[12:11:53] <BillCriswell> $('table').addClass('users--active') or something, since i doubt the text is just larger for no reason.
[12:12:04] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah - that.
[12:12:25] <mirazi_heket> good point, but thats exam exercise, i passed anyway, helping friend ~~
[12:12:35] <robertmaxrees> wait what?
[12:12:44] <mirazi_heket> seriously funny shit sometimes happens on exams (exercises like this)
[12:13:01] <mirazi_heket> well yeah it will make use for me too, anyway im helping for a reason
[12:13:14] <robertmaxrees> did we just, like, help you cheat?
[12:14:07] <mirazi_heket> i passed this exam on highest mark
[12:14:12] <mirazi_heket> im helping friend
[12:14:19] <mirazi_heket> correct exam is tomorrow
[12:14:50] <mirazi_heket> on some universities happens bigger cheats
[12:14:57] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[12:14:59] <robertmaxrees> that's not OK.
[12:14:59] <mirazi_heket> more crazy than you can imagine
[12:15:10] <robertmaxrees> my dad actually worked higher education - not cool duder.
[12:25:32] <stef1a> i'm using jquery-ui sortable. how can i get the DOM object of an item that's being dragged?
[12:25:40] <NoiseEee> here's hoping your doctor cheated, mirazi_heket!
[12:26:29] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'm putting in a github issue to see if we should expand the CoC to cover things like academic dishonesty
[12:26:35] <stef1a> it looks like others have had to update the html itself, but i'd like to avoid this if possible
[12:27:09] <robertmaxrees> .get() should get the dom node from a jquery object.
[12:27:11] <BillCriswell> stef1a: Figure it would be this? I'm not positive though.
[12:27:23] <BillCriswell> Try console.log(this)
[12:27:28] <robertmaxrees> .get(0), rather, ^ or the `this` object inside the handler.
[12:28:04] <BillCriswell> Yeah I'm too lazy to look it up in the documentation haah
[12:29:01] <stef1a> that returns the entire <ul>, not just the <li> item that was dragged
[12:29:19] <BillCriswell> Hmmm
[12:29:25] <robertmaxrees> stef1a from where in your code are you doing this?  what callback?
[12:29:54] <stef1a> stop, i believe
[12:30:17] <BillCriswell> stef1a: Looks like you want ui.item
[12:30:28] <stef1a> :x ughhhhh
[12:30:34] <mirazi_heket> NoiseEee: umm, what?
[12:30:37] <BillCriswell> so like function (event, ui) { console.log(ui.item); }
[12:31:11] <stef1a> yeah... if i want to change that object, is there any way of getting the DOM obj from it? or do i have to replace the raw HTML?
[12:31:27] <stef1a> i can also explain the result i want so we can avoid an XY problem if you'd like...
[12:31:32] <BillCriswell> stef1a: ui.item.get(0) should get it.
[12:32:18] <stef1a> BillCriswell: cool... thanks!
[12:33:56] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[12:42:04] <MarcGuay> Howdy all.  Slick slider question.  When I .unslick() a slider, it seems to erase the navigation HTML, making it broken when reopened - has anyone else experienced this?
[12:44:09] <BillCriswell> MarcGuay: unslick seems like a method to remove everything the plugin did, which would include create the navigation.
[12:44:10] <MarcGuay> Hmm, seems to be by design...
[12:44:26] <MarcGuay> But it didn't create the navigation, I did.
[12:44:47] <BillCriswell> MarcGuay: Oh.
[12:46:50] <robertmaxrees> re you adding that html after the fact to the markup the slider uses?
[12:46:53] <BillCriswell> https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick/blob/master/slick/slick.js#L670 seems like it might remove a little more than it should.
[12:47:28] <MarcGuay> robertmaxrees: No...
[12:49:09] <stef1a> this is looking a bit involved to me, so i'll ask here: i have two lists of items: ranked and unranked. items from one list can be dragged and dropped within it or to the other list. their physical order determines their rank (for the ranked items). i want to include the rank with each item in, e.g., a dropdown. what's the cleanest way to ensure the ranked items are always ordered numerically?
[12:51:02] <stef1a> something like: when an item is put in the ranked list, we update its value to be less than the previous item, and loop over the remaining items to update their values
[12:51:31] <stef1a> and if an item's value is changed, its placement should be changed -- this i'm unsure how to do, and whether it's even desirable...
[12:52:17] <MarcGuay> Okay, updating to the latest version seems to have fixed it partly...
[12:53:19] <TeddyMurray> if i do a $.get , and the included page has a js file, the js error line numbers don't show, it only shows the jquery call to get the page. is there a way to make the error show up?
[12:53:40] <TeddyMurray> i do a $.get and then an $("#element").html(fullpage);
[13:19:31] <guzzlefry> How do I select an option in a <select> element?
[13:19:52] <guzzlefry> $('select').val('12') doesn't seem to do what I think it does.
[13:20:52] <BillCriswell> guzzlefry: That would set the option with value="12" to selected.
[13:21:07] <guzzlefry> wait, I'm dumb.
[13:22:26] <dotevo> Hi! I've problem with jquery mobile. How can I turn off page loading from hash? I'm using Leaflet-hash and there is conflict ( website: http://bicycle.osm24.eu/#!13/52.3145/20.9967 )
[13:23:32] <jen_> Since getElementsByClassName is not supported < IE 8.  Someone suggested jQuery…where is the documentation for this?
[13:24:07] <BillCriswell> jquery.com
[13:25:39] <BillCriswell> jen_: You can use document.querySelectorAll in place of document.getElementsByClassName though.
[13:25:53] <jen_> hi BillCriswell
[13:26:25] <BillCriswell> Howdy
[13:27:12] <jen_> my function calls for getElementById but I need to call the ID multiple times and this is obviously a no no, hence them to getElementByClassName
[13:27:15] <BillCriswell> document.querySelectorAll('.some-class-name') would work in IE8+, where as document.getElementsByClassName('some-class-name') would only work in IE9+
[13:28:00] <jen_> I need to have compatability in IE 7...
[13:28:02] <jen_> as well
[13:28:08] <jen_> hence jquery
[13:29:38] <dotevo> any ideas? :-/
[13:30:29] <BillCriswell> Oh, then in jQuery it would be $('.some-class-name'), but you would want to write out function calls to require just an element instead of a string to pass to document.getElementById()
[13:31:12] <jen_> ok
[13:33:56] <edrahn> I  have some code that does "infinate" scroll on a div: https://dpaste.de/5L4d  How would I make it so that it triggers the botttom scoll part wheen we get within 100 pixelsof the bottom?
[13:33:59] <Buzzyboy> People still use IE7? @.@
[13:34:24] <edrahn> I tried adding -100 and it ends up calling non-stop until it loads
[13:34:35] <snover> Buzzyboy: no :)
[13:34:38] <edrahn> So I'm not quite sure how the current code works
[13:39:19] <Buzzyboy> edrahn: You just want it to infinitly scroll? Why not just append line breaks the more you scroll.
[13:39:36] <Buzzyboy> Or adjust it's padding-bottom.
[13:39:39] <Buzzyboy> its*
[13:41:10] <edrahn> Buzzyboy:: well I'd like to call the ajax when it gets close to the bottom, I guess that's called an "infinite" scroll?
[13:43:39] <Buzzyboy> Let me just getting a running example working with your code.
[13:44:07] <Buzzyboy> @.@
[13:44:12] <Buzzyboy> My english is failing today.
[13:50:14] <Buzzyboy> Hmm.
[13:50:22] <Buzzyboy> I don't think the scrollTop includes the containers actual height.
[13:54:50] <Buzzyboy> edrahn: I replied to your snippet.
[13:55:04] <stef1a> i have this javascript, which freezes the browser whenever i sort items in a list: http://jsfiddle.net/8mf0px8r/ can someone suggest how i might write a finite while loop?.. i would think next would get to the end of the list and the loop would end
[13:55:29] <robertmaxrees> will going to that link freeze my browser, stef1a?
[13:55:56] <robertmaxrees> if so, mind commenting out the js and saving/sharing that instead?
[13:55:56] <Buzzyboy> You just need to reorganize the way you're looping.
[13:56:03] <stef1a> robertmaxrees: it doesn't freeze mine
[13:56:31] <robertmaxrees> ah nonfunctioning.  okay.
[13:56:53] <stef1a> yes, though this is not all the code; this is just the loop
[13:57:05] <robertmaxrees> that's fine - just didn't want to open the fiddle and see my browser lockup.
[13:57:39] <stef1a> understandable :-)
[13:57:45] <robertmaxrees> why are you using a while loop here?  why not a simple .each()?
[13:57:58] <stef1a> because next will not be at the beginning of the list
[13:58:11] <Buzzyboy> You just want to skip the first index?
[13:58:25] <stef1a> no
[13:58:31] <stef1a> next can be at any point in the list
[13:58:35] <robertmaxrees> aaah i see what you're doing here.
[13:58:39] <stef1a> next is the item after the item that was dragged and dropped
[13:58:41] <robertmaxrees> you want to apply a sort to these values
[13:58:47] <robertmaxrees> and a single run-through won't be sufficient.
[13:58:52] <stef1a> err
[13:58:55] <stef1a> i don't want to sort them
[13:59:17] <robertmaxrees> what is the goal of this code, then?
[13:59:30] <stef1a> the assumption is that before the drag and drop occurs, the list is already sorted; so that after the drop occurs, we only need to update the list values of the items below the drop position
[14:00:03] <Buzzyboy> Is this called in the stop function in droppable/sortable?
[14:00:04] <robertmaxrees> how big is this list?
[14:00:22] <stef1a> [a, 0], [b, 1], [c, 2], [d, 3]; move d to position 1 -> [a, 0], [d, 1], [b, 2], [c, 3]
[14:00:32] <stef1a> the list will be at most 20 or 30 items long
[14:00:37] <stef1a> Buzzyboy: yes
[14:00:42] <stef1a> i can paste the whole code if you watn
[14:00:43] <stef1a> want*
[14:01:04] <robertmaxrees> i see what you're getting at.
[14:01:11] <robertmaxrees> this seems really awkward imo.
[14:01:14] <Buzzyboy> Agreed.
[14:01:19] <Buzzyboy> Why not just iterate through them all.
[14:01:28] <Buzzyboy> And when it finds the one it should go after, use an append or moveTo
[14:01:48] <stef1a> because each li has a dropdown, and the value within the dropdown needs to be updated
[14:01:56] <stef1a> this might be an XY problem...
[14:01:59] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[14:02:03] <robertmaxrees> the ux doens't make any sense.
[14:02:13] <stef1a> let me back up a step
[14:02:50] <Buzzyboy> But with each, you could update their numbers.
[14:02:52] <Buzzyboy> Based on their index.
[14:03:00] <Buzzyboy> Or do they not always increment by one?
[14:03:30] <stef1a> the result i want is: each li item has a dropdown, and the user can drag the li's around in the list. when they're dropped in place, the dropdown selects should change to reflect the new order / ranking
[14:03:48] <stef1a> students are ranking classes they want to take in order of preference using drag and drop
[14:04:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah, just .each() through.
[14:04:07] <stef1a> yes, it would make sense for the "indices" (selected values) to increment by 1...
[14:04:14] <robertmaxrees> and update the dropdown to the current index.
[14:05:02] <stef1a> why .each(), if i only need to update the courses in the list below the dragged item?..
[14:05:14] <stef1a> oh
[14:05:15] <robertmaxrees> simplicity.
[14:05:17] <Buzzyboy> Because it's not really going to cost you anything.
[14:05:25] <robertmaxrees> ^ this, too.
[14:05:29] <robertmaxrees> no reason not to in this case.
[14:05:30] <Buzzyboy> Readability > optimization in this case.
[14:05:50] <robertmaxrees> readability > optimization always, until performance becomes a problem.
[14:05:52] <stef1a> makes sense
[14:07:34] <stef1a> so in the stop callback, .each() over... the <ul> dom object? and do what exactly? i want to call .val(prev_val+1) on each <li> object
[14:07:46] <robertmaxrees> the <li> elements.
[14:08:11] <stef1a> i mean, what am i calling .each() on?
[14:08:21] <robertmaxrees> the <li>s ...
[14:08:24] <robertmaxrees> $('ul li').each(function(index, element) {});
[14:08:36] <Buzzyboy> $("ul").find("li").each()
[14:08:42] <robertmaxrees> or that.
[14:08:47] <stef1a> oh, i see
[14:08:50] <Buzzyboy> Or you can call it on the parent of the helper.
[14:09:13] <robertmaxrees> $('ul li').each(function(index, element) { $(this).find('select').val(i + 1) });
[14:09:16] <Buzzyboy> ui.helper.parent().find("li").each()
[14:09:17] <robertmaxrees> err, index + 1
[14:09:25] <Buzzyboy> If you're afraid of that causing collision issues with other lists.
[14:11:27] <stef1a> ehhh
[14:11:33] <stef1a> but it shouldn't change _all_ of the values
[14:11:51] <robertmaxrees> it doesn't really matter.
[14:11:55] <Buzzyboy> They'll get the same value.
[14:11:58] <stef1a> what, why?
[14:12:00] <robertmaxrees> why are you so resistant to tat approach?
[14:12:09] <stef1a> oh oh oh.
[14:12:10] <Buzzyboy> Because they haven't been moved.
[14:14:08] <stef1a> okay, this makes sense. we're just looking at the list and ensuring that each item's selected value corresponds to its position in the list. which is what we want.
[14:14:16] <Buzzyboy> Correct.
[14:14:18] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[14:14:43] <robertmaxrees> actually, you're updating them to correspond, no matter what.  the values won't differ if they don't need to.
[14:15:01] <stef1a> this is simpler than what i had, and it works. thanks for helping out a jquery newbie :-)
[14:15:07] <robertmaxrees> fsho.
[14:15:08] <stef1a> yeah, updating
[14:28:16] <scrandaddy> Hey guys. I am trying to get around the IE 8/9 cors problem by using https://github.com/MoonScript/jQuery-ajaxTransport-XDomainRequest
[14:28:44] <scrandaddy> Even with it loaded I'm getting an Access Denied error in my getJSON call. Anything else I should be doing on top of including the lib?
[14:29:12] <robertmaxrees> are you getting that error in any other browsers?
[14:30:18] <scrandaddy> robertmaxrees: no others
[14:30:21] <ajf-> What gets executed first, the done() part or the always() part of an ajax call ?
[14:30:55] <ajf-> Or depends in the order that I chain them ?
[14:31:04] <robertmaxrees> the order they were registered.
[14:31:52] <ajf-> nice thanks
[14:34:45] <robertmaxrees> api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/#callback-functions tells you fwiw
[14:37:04] <ragas_> im trying to submit forms to 2 different locations with the same button using ajax.  the code is here: http://jsbin.com/gizinahove/1/edit?html,js,output
[14:37:57] <robertmaxrees> okay - what's the problem?
[14:38:04] <robertmaxrees> and don't say "doesn't work"
[14:38:34] <robertmaxrees> return false; - that's your issue.
[14:38:40] <ragas_>  Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 (Bad Request) attendee.gotowebinar.com/g2wattendee/error.tmpl:1 Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[14:38:42] <robertmaxrees> you need to put both of these in the same handler
[14:38:53] <robertmaxrees> and tyhat means your return data isn't actually json
[14:39:08] <robertmaxrees> kill your datatype option.
[14:39:51] <ragas_> they i added that bc it didnt work in the first place. i switched to jsonp to attempt to correct that
[14:44:43] <ragas_> i dont want the form to 'submit', because that causes aformstack page to load.  hence the ajax solution, robertmaxrees
[14:44:55] <robertmaxrees> you're not doing this the right way at all.
[14:45:41] <robertmaxrees> what's the ID/class for the form itself?
[14:47:37] <ragas_> i included the form id, robertmaxrees "<form name='registrationForm' id='registrationForm'
[14:47:55] <robertmaxrees> wait huh?
[14:48:03] <robertmaxrees> this doesn't make any sense.
[14:48:16] <robertmaxrees> your first event listener will never work because the form doesn't exist on pageload.
[14:48:54] <robertmaxrees> http://jsbin.com/hejuqeliqa/1/edit this is closer to what you wnat.
[14:49:55] <robertmaxrees> return false; does some implicit stuff on the event handler that's breaking things for you - use an explicit e.preventDefault() on the submit event instead.
[14:51:25] <ragas_> ok, ill try that.  thanks!  i didnt load the gotwebinar page, i just grabbed the submit, and field values to submit programatically.  maybe i need to make sure there are no hidden keys i need to include
[14:51:47] <ragas_> thanks robertmaxrees !
[14:51:52] <robertmaxrees> err...
[14:51:58] <robertmaxrees> be aware that there's a good chance this'll never work btw.
[14:52:55] <ragas_> yeah, is this inherently a Bad idea?   i could .load() the external form page and hide it..?
[14:53:01] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:53:06] <robertmaxrees> neither of those might work.
[14:53:08] <robertmaxrees> because of CORS>
[14:53:19] <robertmaxrees> do you know if they support cross-domain stuff like this?
[14:53:39] <ragas_> i contacted support for both, havent heard back.
[14:53:50] <robertmaxrees> so why are you trying ot do this in the first place?
[14:54:18] <ragas_> so the end user doesnt have to register twice.  once with CC, and then again with gotowebinar
[14:54:45] <robertmaxrees> why are you making them register for two different services like this?
[14:54:54] <robertmaxrees> because it's not uncommon to require them to do both.
[14:54:59] <ragas_> client requirement
[14:55:06] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[14:55:11] <robertmaxrees> that's a bad idea.
[14:55:54] <ragas_> seemed so clever at the time i started effing around with this..
[14:56:11] <robertmaxrees> you should be sending them to the other companies to sign up for accounts.
[14:56:19] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to be involved with any of that.
[14:56:45] <ragas_> cc is just signing up for a mailing list.  hardly signing up for an account
[14:57:26] <baako> Hi I am trying to add the current class to a list but this doesn't seem to do it. This is what I have try http://jsfiddle.net/9adcyct7/
[14:57:30] <robertmaxrees> they should have documentation that explains how to submit email addresses externally then.
[14:58:00] <robertmaxrees> baako http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9adcyct7/1/ works here.
[15:09:56] <baako> robertmaxrees: damn dont seem to work for me
[15:10:06] <robertmaxrees> what about it doesn't work?
[15:10:13] <robertmaxrees> because the fiddle works.
[15:11:08] <baako> robertmaxrees: okay it adds the class then removes it
[15:11:18] <baako> i had to slow my internet down to see thos
[15:11:36] <baako> so before the page fully reloads it add it and after it removes it
[15:11:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:15:23] <baako> robertmaxrees: because when you click on it, it takes you to the next page
[15:15:50] <baako> but when the page reload it removes it
[15:17:30] <robertmaxrees> oh i get it.
[15:17:49] <doughj3> I want to do an ajax call after a number input field has been edited. What event should I bind to?
[15:18:51] <doughj3> Thinking about using .focusout, but not sure if that's best (and would fire the ajax call unncessarily when the field gets focus and loses focus without the value changing).
[15:19:01] <baako> robertmaxrees: so what is your suggestion?
[15:21:12] <robertmaxrees> doughj3 change
[15:21:33] <doughj3> robertmaxrees: will .change() be triggered as a user types?
[15:21:41] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:21:44] <doughj3> Thanks
[15:21:59] <z1haze2> i am having an issue with an added label screwing up my label animation: http://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/017kd0u6/6/ is it possible to select an element with next() that has a certain class?
[15:29:33] <baako> robertmaxrees: so i tried to do it this way http://kopy.io/mOf7V
[15:29:44] <baako> but this doesnt add the add when i reload a new page
[15:30:13] <robertmaxrees> $(this) isn't what you think it is there.
[15:30:54] <doughj3> Setting .val() on a `select` isn't triggering the `.change()` event I've set up. How can I trigger that event?
[15:31:04] <BillCriswell> doughj3: .trigger('change')
[15:31:10] <doughj3> Thanks
[15:31:19] <BillCriswell> So like $('.options').val('2').trigger('change')
[15:31:25] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[15:31:34] <doughj3> Awesome, works great.
[15:31:56] <z1haze2> is there anything besides next that can select the next element that contains a certain class
[15:32:29] <Buzzyboy> baako: Are you trying to make certain links contain the "current" class throughout your site?
[15:33:16] <tomasm-> is there a way to have different click events fire based on an anchor link and a span inside of the anchor tag? I have a menu system that includes links and a "caret" icon for a dropdown (inside of the anchor, due to css issues), and I wanted to follow the link when the text is clicked on but show the dropdown when the caret icon is clicked on.
[15:33:17] <BillCriswell> z1haze2: You can use .nextAll()
[15:33:40] <BillCriswell> z1haze2: .next('.foo') would get the next element only if it's .foo
[15:33:59] <BillCriswell> .nextAll('.foo') would get all elements after that are .foo
[15:34:00] <z1haze2> how do i say get me the next element that is .foo
[15:34:02] <baako> Buzzyboy: i am trying to do this http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9adcyct7/1/ but when the page reload it add it has that example in the link doesnt work for me
[15:34:21] <BillCriswell> z1haze2: .nextAll('.foo').first() I think.
[15:34:44] <baako> Buzzyboy: so am trying to add remove the current current and add it to the current link like http://kopy.io/mOf7V
[15:35:02] <Buzzyboy> JavaScript may not be your best approach here.
[15:35:02] <z1haze2> BillCriswell, heres my test case: http://jsfiddle.net/z1haze/017kd0u6/6/ basically i animate the labels, but my validation adds another label on error, and it gets screwed up because the animation trys to add itself to the wrong label
[15:35:04] <robertmaxrees> baako $(this) isn't what you think it is.
[15:35:09] <robertmaxrees> you should use your backend to do this.
[15:35:22] <Buzzyboy> I agree with Robert.
[15:36:00] <robertmaxrees> now if only my wife would do that more often...
[15:36:32] <robertmaxrees> tomasm- assuming i understand your question, yes.
[15:36:39] <BillCriswell> z1haze2: http://jsbin.com/ruyiluwebo/1/edit?html,js,output
[15:36:44] <Buzzyboy> The changes you're making in jQuery do not carry over to the next load.
[15:37:13] <z1haze2> cool this may work
[15:39:39] <tomasm-> robertmaxtrees, basically i need a different click handler for $("a") and $("a span") , in a case of <a href='/somewhere.html'>Link Name<span>DROPDOWN</span></a>
[15:39:58] <robertmaxrees> you can use the same and change the logic depending on the existince of a thing.
[15:42:13] <tomasm-> yeah actually i dont need a click handler for the anchor since following the link is what i want to do.
[16:09:55] <Guddu__> I get an error in my Web App

[16:10:05] <Guddu__> semantic.js:497 Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined

[16:10:21] <Guddu__> What cna id o to resolve this problem?
[16:10:47] <Woet> define jQuery?
[16:11:53] <Guddu__> Woet, You mean include JQuery file?
[16:12:19] <Woet> Guddu__: yes.
[16:12:47] <Guddu__> Thanks woet
[16:18:15] <Guddu__> Thanks Woet I included jquery-1.11.2.min.js and it solved my issue :-)
[16:21:55] <Guddu__> Is it recommended to use JQUery 2.x or 1.x?
[16:22:31] <Buzzyboy> Depends if you want to support older browsers or not.
[16:26:45] <systemfault> Guddu__: Both are the same but 1.x supports older browsers (like ie8)
[16:26:54] <Guddu__> Thanks systemfault
[16:27:03] <Guddu__> Thanks Buzzyboy
[16:28:41] <destsk1> Hi guys - I need to implement a function that can create a bunch of checkboxes, given a list of labels (where the list is passed as an argument). Is that possible? I'm a total beginner, so any examples I could work on would be great!
[16:50:33] <baako> anyone here used OAUTH before please? if yes in this part of the documentation http://docs.oauth.io/?PHP#configuration what does it mean by To authorize your app using OAuth.io, you just need to add a provider to your OAuth.io app, copy/paste your provider’s API Keys (usually client_id and client_secret),
[17:08:48] <jazibobs> hi does anyone have experience updating svg clip-paths with jquery?
[17:09:19] <Woet> jazibobs: http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc
[17:12:46] <jazibobs> I'm looking for the correct syntax to set a clip-path using the css function in jquery, I've created the following topic on stackoverflow which hopefully better explains what I'm trying to achieve: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28422133/how-to-update-an-svg-clip-path-using-jquery is it possible to update the coordinates of a clip-path: polygon() using jquery?
[17:47:24] <Mark_2> hey.
[17:48:07] <robertmaxrees> yo
[17:48:11] <Mark_2> does anybody know why the jquery drag doesn’t work on myewbsite?
[17:48:19] <Mark_2> i applied this http://threedubmedia.com/demo/drag/
[17:48:21] <robertmaxrees> is it unemployed?
[17:48:22] <robertmaxrees> or what?
[17:48:31] <Mark_2> hmm? what’s unemployed?
[17:48:43] <Woet> Mark_2: http://workaround.org/getting-help-on-irc
[17:48:47] <robertmaxrees> you said it "doesn't work" ;)
[17:49:03] <robertmaxrees> that's basically the most unhelpful thing you can say - be specific..
[17:49:12] <Mark_2> sorry!
[17:49:29] <Mark_2> try clicking on the click me button here
[17:49:30] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/page_FIsv96
[17:49:35] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:49:47] <Mark_2> i applied that js, and the layer doesn’t seem to be moving even a bit.
[17:49:54] <Mark_2> that’s what’s the problem :)
[17:50:15] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ Mark_2
[17:50:17] <b-ot> Mark_2: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:50:22] <Mark_2> ah.
[17:51:20] <jazibobs> hi does anyone know if it is possible to set the values of a clip-path: polygon() using jquery?
[17:51:58] <jazibobs> I've tried using the .css() function but I think this might be the wrong approach, I've made a stackoverflow question here which hopefully makes things clearer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28422133/how-to-update-an-svg-clip-path-using-jquery
[17:52:00] <robertmaxrees> jazibobs what browser are you in?
[17:52:17] <jazibobs> i'm using chrome robert
[17:52:32] <robertmaxrees> try using -webkit-clip-path and see if that works.
[17:52:35] <Mark_2> http://jsfiddle.net/fkaknrvm/
[17:52:54] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 .bind() has been deprecated for a long time,.
[17:53:01] <Mark_2> hmm,
[17:53:27] <Mark_2> this document im reading must have been there for quite a while then
[17:53:40] <acidjazz> -webkit-dong-path
[17:53:41] <robertmaxrees> also, look at your console in that fiddle.
[17:53:55] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:54:26] <jazibobs> the clip-paths are working without a problem, I'm using polygon() to create my path and I'm wondering if it's possible to update the percentage values using jquery?
[17:54:38] <robertmaxrees> jazibobs it should be, yes.
[17:54:50] <robertmaxrees> but you need to make sure you're editing the correct property.
[17:54:51] <Mark_2> console doesnt seem to say much?
[17:55:01] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 i get an error every time i try to click and drag.
[17:55:07] <robertmaxrees> e.event.handle is undefined.
[17:55:09] <Mark_2> sec
[17:56:01] <Mark_2> hmm, according to console it seems it’s dragging but invisible.
[17:56:10] <Mark_2> god i hate complication.
[17:56:56] <jazibobs> robertmaxrees i've tried using the css() function to update the properties but it's been unsuccessful so far
[17:57:06] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle?
[18:00:03] <Mark_2> does anybody know how to get this thing work? http://jsfiddle.net/fkaknrvm/
[18:00:12] <Mark_2> or should i post this on SO
[18:00:13] <robertmaxrees> looks like a bugged plugin, Mark_2
[18:00:20] <Mark_2> okay..
[18:00:29] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fkaknrvm/1/
[18:00:33] <Mark_2> cause jquery dragging simply doesn’t work
[18:00:42] <robertmaxrees> "jquery dragging"
[18:00:42] <robertmaxrees> ?
[18:01:06] <Mark_2> oh i meant the simple jquery dragging UI
[18:01:11] <Mark_2> its lagging badly
[18:01:13] <robertmaxrees> jquery ui draggables?
[18:01:20] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/page_FIsv96
[18:01:42] <robertmaxrees> you think it might be the fullscreen video?
[18:01:46] <robertmaxrees> because that's really distractng.
[18:02:32] <Mark_2> idk, i still havent’ figure out how to design my webpage
[18:02:38] <robertmaxrees> ditch the video.
[18:02:45] <Mark_2> only thought of ‘oh, dragging window would be cool!’
[18:03:00] <Mark_2> haven’t i shown you this? http://www.alessioatzeni.com/mac-osx-lion-css3/#all
[18:03:05] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[18:03:29] <robertmaxrees> dunno what that has to do with a page that has a full-sized video playing in the background.
[18:04:17] <Mark_2> well,
[18:04:29] <Mark_2> i think it’s rather the content of the video that’s ditracting
[18:04:49] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[18:04:54] <Mark_2> i want to have a nice quiet background that moves occasionally...
[18:05:20] <robertmaxrees> i really would advise against it.
[18:05:30] <Mark_2> haha..
[18:06:19] <Mark_2> do you have your own website?
[18:06:20] <jazibobs> hi robert just to let you know, my problem with the polygon values updating was because i was missing the -webkit- prefix, I thought jquery autodetected features these days?
[18:06:53] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 i work on a very large ecommerce site and run a (bad) blog on the side.
[18:07:00] <robertmaxrees> jazibobs i suggested that you try the prefix.
[18:07:11] <robertmaxrees> and not everything is included iirc.
[18:07:44] <robertmaxrees> it has to know which properties are prefixed - that's new enough that it wouldn't be included.
[18:07:55] <jazibobs> i know you advised that robert so i wanted to thank you for your suggestion, i should have tried it sooner :)
[18:08:00] <robertmaxrees> fsho :)
[18:20:53] <robertmaxrees> and with that, i go home.  enjoy olks.

[18:27:03] <coderzm> i think its similar to this - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7975093/typeerror-undefined-is-not-a-function-evaluating-document
[18:29:51] <coderzm> nvm, i solved it by wrapping the codes around noconflict wrap
[18:46:43] <aerth> hello i'm looking everywhere for a way to use horizontal swipe on a web page. I can get it to work on desktop browser, but it doesn't work at all on a mobile device. I want to be able to switch pages on the web site by swiping left and right.
[18:48:32] <aerth> sort of a full page carousel
[18:51:23] <BillCriswell> aerth: That can get a little tricky with built in device gestures, but it shouldn't be too tough getting that to work with with your run of the mill slideshow.
[18:53:48] <aerth> i've tried responsive-carousel, responsive_carousel, and jssor to no avail
[18:54:14] <aerth> the built in device gestures sometimes switch windows/tabs
[18:54:57] <Terminus> aerth: i've used http://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/ before and it seems to work fine.
[18:55:42] <Terminus> oh... yeah, i can't remember if i had that problem.
[18:56:04] <BillCriswell> aerth: Yeah, as far as I know you can't override those getures.
[18:56:21] <aerth> Thank you Terminus
[18:56:28] <aerth> and BillCriswell too :D
[18:56:38] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[18:56:51] <aerth> DUDE Terminus thats it. thanks!
[19:01:04] <aerth> doesn't swipe with the mouse on a desktop though, thats the only issue.
[19:06:08] <BillCriswell> aerth: This site is pretty amazing and does something like you're searching for. Might eb able to check out their code: http://www.badassembly.com/
[19:06:21] <aerth> ;D
[19:07:15] <ghostchilli> Hey guys. I've got a form which validates inputs on blur, if there is a problem, I use .append to add the error returned via Ajax (which does in a div). But when a correct entry is found, I can't seem to remove the div which was added. Any ideas?
[19:08:32] <BillCriswell> ghostchilli: You can check for the error div or whatever you append.
[19:09:27] <acidjazz> ghostchilli: you dont really wanan validate on blur
[19:09:30] <acidjazz> that could mess w/ mobile/tablet
[19:09:30] <BillCriswell> ghostchilli: It really depends on your html.
[19:09:58] <ghostchilli> Validating on blur is bad?
[19:10:48] <ghostchilli> As for the html, it's just a bunch of <label>blah</label><input> repeat. But it seems that appending a div doesn't add it to the DOM, or something.
[19:11:03] <BillCriswell> ghostchilli: Definitely adds it to the dom
[19:11:20] <ghostchilli> Oh wait. I'm using, .after, not append
[19:11:38] <BillCriswell> It would still be added to the DOM.
[19:12:52] <BillCriswell> So if you're doing line $('input').after('<div class="error">Invalid</div>') then you can do like if ( $('input').next('.error').length ) { /* It exists */ }
[19:14:06] <BillCriswell> Though keep in mind what acidjazz said.
[19:15:46] <ghostchilli> Yep, that worked perfectly Bill. Thank you. I was using $('#contact_email').closest($(".error")).remove();
[19:16:54] <BillCriswell> .closest() would go up and find the closest parent that the selector matches.
[19:17:09] <BillCriswell> For future reference.
[19:17:22] <ghostchilli> Oh, I see. I thought it went both ways.
[19:17:53] <BillCriswell> Nope, just up through the ancestors.
[19:19:11] <acidjazz> great gret great granddiv
[19:19:33] <ghostchilli> Ahh, cheers. I thought blur would be a nice way to validate, since you can highlight errors or invalid entries as they go through the form. If it's not a good way to do it, how else would you recommend?
[19:22:16] <aerth> https://teamtreehouse.com/forum/whats-this-effect-called <-- Re:badassembly.com
[19:23:59] <BillCriswell> aerth: Hm?
[19:26:21] <aerth> woops! still no mouse support on those. trying to disect badassembly
[19:26:55] <ghostchilli> Oh, BillCriswell, I've noticed that this will remove errors from other inputs. Is there a way to say, only step 1 element down looking for errors?
[19:28:53] <BillCriswell> ghostchilli: In the blur event you'd want to use $(this) and not $('input')
[19:29:39] <ghostchilli> Ahh, of course
[19:44:11] <goddard> how can i get the index of the list item which was clicked?
[19:54:11] <aerth> Btw in case anyone else wants to know how badassembly did it : https://github.com/nolimits4web/Swiper
[19:57:10] <kevireilly> goddard: $('ul').on('click', 'li', function(e){ $(this).index(); });
[20:02:11] <Buzzyboy> Greetings.
[20:02:19] <aerth> :)
[20:03:24] <BillCriswell> aerth: Nice.
[20:04:36] <Buzzyboy> Has anyone toyed around with using a lot of sortables, each with their own rules? If so, how is the performance when you hit around 30+ sortables?
[20:17:40] <alexclark_> is there anyway to get a third party iframe to be the height of its contents?
[20:17:49] <alexclark_> ie no scrollbars
[20:29:11] <Buzzyboy> alexclark_: Does settings its height to auto not work?
[20:31:17] <acidjazz> alaing: you can youse JS to detect if it has scrollbars/etc
[20:31:22] <acidjazz> alexclark_: err you
[20:31:28] <acidjazz> alexclark_: this is hwo facebook works w/ facebook apps
[20:31:47] <acidjazz> alexclark_: it detectgs the inner iframe height and re-adjusts the height accordingly, it actaully does it every couple seconds in case the 3rd party iframe height changes
[20:40:27] <holler> hello, anyone with knowledge of qunit

[20:59:33] <hrolf> Hi #jquery
[21:00:38] <hrolf> I have <div id="myPage"> ..... some elements having variable number of childs ... <a href="#" id="forward">forward</a> ... some more elements ... </div>
[21:00:54] <hrolf> I have <div id="myPage"> ..... some elements having variable number of childs ... <a href="#" class="forward">forward</a> ... some more elements ... </div>
[21:01:14] <hrolf> how do I select the forward anchor in myPage div?
[21:01:27] <hrolf> There would be multiple forward anchors in different divs
[21:01:48] <hrolf> What would be the selector for #myPage > .forward ?
[21:02:32] <hrolf> it is quite possible that the .forward anchor could be in any div or would be direct child of the div myPage
[21:02:38] <hrolf> Any ideas?
[21:04:13] <Buzzyboy> hrolf: Not quite sure what you mean. Could you put it in a fiddle or some type of pastebin?
[21:05:03] <hrolf> Buzzyboy: Sure. Let me try.
[21:08:21] <hrolf> Buzzyboy: Here it is: http://jsfiddle.net/qqfqkapq/
[21:08:53] <hrolf> I want to select the anchors .forward and .back of specific pages (<div id="myPage1">)
[21:09:36] <Buzzyboy> Do you mean you just want something like $("#myPage1").find(".forward")?
[21:09:36] <hrolf> Something like ('#myPage1 > .forward') so that it selects the .forward anchor which is inside #myPage1 div.
[21:10:16] <Velveeta> that should be as simple as $('#myPage1 .forward')
[21:10:16] <hrolf> Now the issue is that the .foward, .back anchors could be nested in variable no. of divs inside the myPage1 div.
[21:10:26] <Buzzyboy> Doesn't matter.
[21:10:30] <hrolf> Velveeta: Really, cool.
[21:10:33] <Buzzyboy> Either selectors will find it.
[21:10:40] <hrolf> Buzzyboy: I see. Thanks.
[21:10:46] <Buzzyboy> No problem.
[21:11:00] <hrolf> I don't know jquery ... so sorry if it seemed like a noob question.
[21:11:02] <hrolf> Thanks.
[21:11:05] <Buzzyboy> No worries.
[21:11:07] <Buzzyboy> We all start somewhere.
[21:12:19] <Velveeta> trust me, that's nowhere near the level of newbie questions we've seen in here from time to time :)
[21:12:20] <Buzzyboy> The ">" part of the selector selects only direct descendants of the first selector.
[21:12:28] <Buzzyboy> Just for future referance.
[21:13:14] <Buzzyboy> I learned quite a bit from this article if you're interested.
[21:13:15] <Buzzyboy> http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/the-30-css-selectors-you-must-memorize--net-16048
[21:14:12] <hrolf> Buzzyboy: Thanks. I'll look into it.
[21:14:18] <Buzzyboy> Does anyone has a contextMenu jQuery plugin they'd reccomend?
[21:14:25] <Buzzyboy> have a*
[21:44:40] <jeffreylevesque> is ajax success deprecated?
[21:44:44] <jeffreylevesque> in favor for done?
[23:21:44] <Cork> jeffreylevesque: no, the $.ajax().success is though
[23:22:01] <Cork> $.ajax({ success: func }) is still supported
