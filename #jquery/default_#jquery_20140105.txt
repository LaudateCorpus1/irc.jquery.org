[01:52:22] <SyntheCypher> Hey is there anyway to retain context of the model in an event handler like so "this.$el.find('.front').on('webkitTransitionEnd', this.flipFinished);"
[03:46:04] <drager> So I'm creating and moving new elements (abit to the bottom and to the left) https://dpaste.de/K86w  in another element but when I'm coming to the "end" of the parent element it should "start over" so it doesn't have a position outside of the parent element. Ideas?
[05:04:00] <TheJHNZ> $('#reg-footer a', '#somethingelse')
[05:04:05] <TheJHNZ> would this work ?
[05:04:28] <TheJHNZ> if i wanted to check for 2 things on click
[05:08:56] <_rgn> $('#reg-footer a, #somethingelse')
[05:13:36] <TheJHNZ> got it :)
[05:23:51] <Guest46684> wow jstorage is fricking cool. i've always hated cookies.
[06:07:47] <TheJHNZ> can you override javascripts checking of pointer-events?
[07:11:58] <mink> Hi guys. Anyone could tell me in which browsers type PUT/DELETE is supported?
[07:12:08] <mink> with jQuery?
[07:12:35] <AlexR> ummÖ all of them?
[07:19:28] <AlexR2> every modern browser should support them
[07:22:05] <pedda> hi there
[07:23:02] <pedda> i'm trying to figure out how to disable and enable bootstrap affix plugin on certain viewport
[07:25:43] <pedda> fat recommends to remove affix event from window and remove affix-related classes for affected dom element
[07:26:24] <pedda> this does work, but hod do i enable it again if the viewport is > 768 for instance?
[07:28:40] <pedda> this is how the code looks like
[07:28:41] <pedda> http://pastebin.com/YnddyBa6
[07:30:48] <pedda> once the eventhandler is off()'ed the next initialization has no effect
[07:31:31] <pedda> any suggestions?
[07:39:54] <AlexR2> pedda, you can probably do it with css
[07:40:05] <pedda> i think i got it
[07:40:45] <pedda> if i only remove the affix related classes, without off'ing the event handler it seems to reinit back again if viewport > 768
[07:41:29] <pedda> seems to work as i intended
[07:41:58] <pedda> next question: is this a clean way to enable an affix feature and reinit on every resize ?
[07:43:51] <pedda> AlexR2: let me think about it ..
[07:44:33] <AlexR2> pedda, I haven't used affix to much.  Is all of it done through classes?  If so, you can just use responsive css to disable it's functionality without using any js
[07:44:34] <pedda> you're right it's only the position property i need to fix ..
[07:51:14] <pedda> sadly affix adds an inline style attribute to the div container providing the element with a calculated top offset like: top: -77px..
[07:53:15] <AlexR2> ahh that's annoying
[07:53:39] <pedda> solved anyway
[07:53:52] <pedda> setting top: auto !important did the trick
[07:54:11] <pedda> the only occurence of !important... that's okay for me :)
[08:22:18] <paulvd> Hello, I am trying to make a multilevel dropdown menu to work on mouse click, its all fine except for the 3rd level menu, which is also working but then the 2nd level closes, here is the jsfiddle for it http://jsfiddle.net/DNrLb/
[08:25:12] <paulvd> ok i figured it out
[08:32:43] <Catalin-> Hello.
[08:47:26] <nucc1> Hi, i've got a bit of ajax that's giving me a blank div even though all signs indicate content was received: http://jsbin.com/OzoPEGu/3/edit
[08:47:34] <nucc1> on jsfiddle, it seems fine
[08:48:17] <jphase> nucc1: you need to include jQuery in your jsbin
[08:49:32] <nucc1> jphase: :) thanks. done http://jsbin.com/OzoPEGu/3/edit
[08:49:45] <nucc1> now it behaves like it behaves for me
[08:49:56] <jphase> odd, it definitely is still throwing errors
[08:50:08] <jphase> oh, there's two versions of jQuery included
[08:50:26] <jphase> hmm, this works in fiddle?
[08:50:43] <shoky> nucc1: you can't load ajax from a different origin unless the server specifically allows it
[08:50:55] <shoky> XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://lynx.browser.org/. No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource. Origin 'http://run.jsbin.com' is therefore not allowed access.
[08:51:16] <jphase> shoky: it looks like jsbin.com actually does that for you when you select "Add Library"... idk, I'm not as familiar with jsbin
[08:51:16] <nucc1> ok, lemme use another source url.
[08:51:29] <shoky> jphase: no, it doesn't do it for you.. it can't
[08:51:50] <shoky> nucc1 the server has to specifically support CORS
[08:51:54] <jphase> well, when I click Add Library and select jQuery, it inserts the script into the <head> tag
[08:51:55] <jphase> so...
[08:52:03] <shoky> jphase: so? that adds jquery..
[08:52:22] <jphase> we're talking about two different things
[08:52:29] <jphase> I was just talking about the jQuery lib
[08:52:35] <shoky> k. i wasn't :p
[08:52:44] <jphase> yeah I gathered
[08:53:32] <nucc1> shoky: ok, i was trying to make it work on the internet so i could demonstrate. the app it is part of is not on the public net. basically, the content is returned, but the div is made empty, instead of displaying the content.
[08:53:55] <nucc1> chrome developer tools shows a 200 OK response for the ajax call.
[08:54:12] <shoky> and it shows the response html ?
[08:54:52] <shoky> is it a full html page? cause that's not too proper to load with .load, ideally you load just html snippets (something that can go into a <div>)
[08:55:16] <nucc1> shoky: see the headers http://pastebin.com/rxebLJKb
[08:55:49] <nucc1> shoky: it's not full html. Just a <h1>header</h1> and a <pre> something </pre>
[08:56:14] <shoky> i was asking about the response body, not the headers
[08:56:25] <shoky> you see the html in chrome's devtools network tab?
[08:56:27] <nucc1> the content length says 865
[08:56:37] <shoky> you can look at the content itself
[08:57:27] <nucc1> shoky: http://pastebin.com/iBiM3ycV
[08:58:56] <shoky> nucc1 welp i'd need to see the problem myself..
[08:59:13] <nucc1> lemme put it online somewhere.
[09:11:05] <nucc1> shoky: go to http://ssldumpviewer.com/index.php?&step=0 , and upload this file: http://nucco.org/files/aj.txt . It will create a link which when you click, should update the yellow-bordered div with the contents of that file.
[09:11:30] <nucc1> it will display an alert first...
[09:14:45] <krastavac> is there property to set position of infobox relative to marker i google maps?
[09:25:25] <mll1998> anyone knows a good framework if i want a choose yourself adventure game for a webpage? is javascript the best language i can use? can you link any source codes of games like this?
[09:25:46] <nucc1> hi shoky, gotta go now. thanks for your time.
[09:27:38] <chipotle> hi, i want to learn javascript so i can become a better drupal front end developer. what do you suggest? i mainly will work with jquery, but i think you need to program js first before using jquery?
[09:27:40] <chipotle> i don't like videos, i prefer books or online texts...
[09:46:51] <und3rtowgrl> hi
[09:47:59] <jphase> hello
[09:48:08] <chipotle> hi jphase !
[09:48:09] <chipotle> how goes?
[09:48:21] <jphase> goes well, how art thou?
[09:48:57] <chipotle> i'm okay
[09:49:01] <chipotle> trying to learn js and jquery
[09:49:06] <jphase> chipotle: I would highly recommend this book - http://www.amazon.com/Eloquent-JavaScript-Modern-Introduction-Programming/dp/1593272820
[09:49:08] <chipotle> i'm a backend drupal dev, but iw ant to become a jack of all trades
[09:49:18] <chipotle> jphase: i just found it online, on their website
[09:49:22] <chipotle> that is a good book?
[09:49:29] <jphase> yes, it's a good read
[09:49:56] <chipotle> ok, thanks
[09:50:39] <chipotle> what do you recommend writing js code in? i have sublime text 3 that i bought, that is quite nice for php/python scripting...
[09:50:49] <jphase> sublime text ftw
[09:50:50] <jphase> imo
[09:54:15] <chipotle> ok
[09:55:43] <jphase> it's cross-platform, written in python, and wicked sexy pants with syntax highlighting... tough to beat. if you want an IDE that "makes toast" the JetBrains stuff is pretty gnarly, but it takes a good machine to run it because it "makes toast"
[10:17:26] <mysteronyx> in jplayer, when I set the path of a sound file, I've been using the full address: http://www.mysite.com/sounds/sound.wav. I want to just do /sounds/sound.wav, but I'm not sure what the current directory is in jquery. How can I find out?
[10:25:20] <Xano> Are plugins for 1.10 compatible with jQuery 2? It looks like they are, but I can't find an explicit statement of (in)compatibility on the site
[10:31:26] <flexd> Hm, if I have a table with lots of data in it, what would be the best way of performing 'tasks' (just as delete, move etc) on one or more of those ?
[10:33:46] <aFeijo> hi folks
[10:34:23] <aFeijo> I have a .click(e) event for the body, I need to get which element the user clicked. If a button, a link, a div, etc. How can I do that?
[10:36:27] <Velveeta> afeijo: look at the e.target property
[10:37:05] <mysteronyx> This is my issue regarding file path: http://pastebin.com/UPJQ4Njs
[10:38:12] <Velveeta> mysteronyx: you can try file://, but i'm not positive browser security policies will let you access local files
[10:38:14] <aFeijo> Velveeta, it return the clicked element html...
[10:38:36] <mysteronyx> Velveeta ok, so there's no other way you can think of to make a local path?
[10:38:38] <Velveeta> afeijo: it will show you the actual dom node that was clicked on, it's a direct reference to that element
[10:38:52] <Velveeta> mysteronyx: not to my knowledge
[10:38:58] <mysteronyx> Velveeta ok thanks
[10:39:04] <aFeijo> hmmm
[10:39:14] <Velveeta> afeijo: if you need to check that element against a certain selector, you can use the .is() function
[10:39:24] <Velveeta> `api is ~afeijo
[10:39:24] <b-ot> Velveeta: memorised ‚Äúapi‚Äù.
[10:39:34] <Velveeta> wtf
[10:39:39] <Velveeta> `api is @afeijo
[10:39:39] <b-ot> afeijo: .is(): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return <code>true</code> if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[10:39:39] <syncsys_> http://pastebin.ca/2530059  how to declare a function inside a .jsp page which can be called in the same page many times (I plan to make a recursive function to iterate some hierarhical objects untill the hirarchy finishes)
[10:39:44] <Velveeta> there we go
[10:40:31] <Velveeta> syncsys_: that's not exact a jquery function
[10:40:36] <Velveeta> er, question
[10:53:26] <grafi> Velveeta is not exactly cheese
[10:53:31] <grafi> *waves*
[10:59:03] <aFeijo> Velveeta, I need a way to store the clicked element by id, position, class... I don't know what element it will be naturally, and after the user clicked it, it will set fields like a title, I need to store it to later display :/
[10:59:49] <Velveeta> afeijo: so set a variable equal to e.target, or bind it as a data property to something else
[11:00:22] <aFeijo> Velveeta, I'll store it in the database (mysql), and I'm using php
[11:00:44] <Velveeta> you want to store a clicked object in the database?
[11:00:55] <Velveeta> well‚Ä¶ you can do something like this:
[11:00:57] <aFeijo> Velveeta, I want to save which object somehow
[11:01:09] <aFeijo> not all the object itself
[11:01:15] <aFeijo> just a reference
[11:01:26] <Velveeta> .on('click', function (e) { var target = $(e.target), id = target.attr('id'), class = e.target[0].className;
[11:01:31] <aFeijo> it would be nice if all object had the ID
[11:01:40] <Velveeta> i mean, you could get its id or className properties for storage
[11:02:02] <aFeijo> Velveeta, and if no id nor class, the eq() ?
[11:02:18] <Velveeta> sure, you could get .index()
[11:02:30] <aFeijo> great! thanks
[11:02:34] <aFeijo> got enough inspiration :)
[11:02:57] <Velveeta> no problemo
[11:03:25] <grafi> oO
[11:04:13] <aFeijo> time to take my girls to the swimming pool!! 32∫C here ;) bye folks, thanks Velveeta
[12:02:37] <syncsys_> how to print out html by a function in jquery?
[12:03:07] <jphase> `api .html @ syncsys_
[12:03:07] <b-ot> syncsys_: No matches.
[12:03:10] <jphase> doh!
[12:03:14] <jphase> `api html @ syncsys_
[12:03:14] <b-ot> syncsys_: .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[12:06:27] <syncsys_> jphase,  I have some html in a function, i want that html to be part of the page at which the function is called. how to construct such fucntion?
[12:07:45] <jphase> syncsys_: it would be a lot easier if you had a code sample. are you saying you have html in a string and you want to render that html inside of some element on the page when the function is called?
[12:10:04] <syncsys_> jphase,  yes
[12:11:33] <jphase> syncsys_: $('body').html(yourHTMLvariable);  would set the html in var yourHTMLvariable inside the body. It's the same function I linked you to above
[12:17:02] <syncsys_> jphase,  thx
[14:00:32] <Doxin> I am $.getting some remote files in a for loop, but I need access to the requested url in the callback, how do I?
[14:12:48] <NicoJuicy> can zapier's first page be mimicked with backstretch jquery plugin ? https://zapier.com/
[14:13:07] <NicoJuicy> so when i scroll, the image is immediatly finished and some random content begins?
[14:14:03] <NicoJuicy> or is some other way better?
[15:29:24] <cameron262> i have a single page site and i want the navigation to be fixed after scrolling past the header
[15:29:55] <cameron262> to begin with it's 20px from the top
[15:30:09] <cameron262> and as you scroll down i want it to get closer to the top if that makes sense
[15:30:26] <cameron262> so that by the time the header is out of the frame, the margin from the header to the top of the page is 0px
[15:30:31] <cameron262> how would i do that?
[15:31:08] <cuqa> hey yooo whats up
[15:32:00] <cuqa> got a prob with $.submit() .. im using a variety of input fields (input, textarea, select) and I wanna use a hotkey combo to submit the form
[15:32:28] <cuqa> some fields are required and when clicking on the submit button the browser tells the user if a field is missing
[15:32:46] <cuqa> but $.submit() apparently breaks this because the form is submitted even with empty fields
[15:41:02] <usrx> hi, is try.jquery.com any good when learning jQuery or do you recommend any these two books (if any): "jquery. from novice to ninja" or "jquery in action"
[15:41:16] <cuqa> $.click() is betta
[15:42:57] <Velveeta> cuqa: you should use submit vs click because if a user hits enter on an input field, it can submit the form also, so your click handler wouldn't catch that
[15:43:20] <Velveeta> submit won't submit the form if you tell it not to, e.g. if your validation doesn't pass
[15:43:23] <cuqa> thats no prob
[15:43:33] <Velveeta> $.submit() is betta
[15:43:58] <cuqa> mainly I wanna use the hotkey combo because enter does not work on select
[15:44:27] <Velveeta> right, but enter would work on text-input fields, so you still risk submitting your form with empty fields
[15:44:38] <cuqa> which costs a couple of clicks and time is an issue
[15:45:00] <Velveeta> just have your hotkey trigger submit on the form, and within the submit function, validate your form for empty fields, and if it fails validation, just don't submit
[15:45:09] <cuqa> but with enter the browser checks for rewquired fields by default, so if the field is empty and not required .. not so bad
[15:45:44] <cuqa> ok i was lying so far. i do not have an input field :P .. but may be in future
[15:46:00] <Velveeta> i don't understand why adding a submit listener isn't working for you
[15:46:13] <cuqa> currently its just about the not working <[Enter]> on select elements
[15:46:19] <Velveeta> it isn't a problem of the library, i can tell you that much
[15:46:39] <Velveeta> ok, so enter doesn't submit on select elements, that much is true, but you say you have a hotkey to submit when they're on those elements
[15:46:58] <cuqa> well, checking for valid input is too much work for that imho
[15:47:11] <Velveeta> too much work for what, a submit handler?
[15:47:43] <cuqa> checking for non empty imput .. okay, thats quickly done.. but the browser checks for valid input
[15:48:02] <Velveeta> yeah, on submit...
[15:48:17] <cuqa> have to check for valid input once it has been submitted. dont wanna do that in php and additionally in jquery
[15:48:34] <Velveeta> so where do you want it to happen, in php or in jquery?
[15:48:34] <cuqa> if ppl enter asdf in a number input
[15:48:41] <Velveeta> because technically, it *should* be done in both
[15:49:00] <cuqa> im fine with the browser check
[15:49:05] <Velveeta> you don't ever want to just trust data on the server that the client has passed, and at the same time, you don't want to make a round trip to the server if you know the form is in an invalid state
[15:49:13] <cuqa> so i still prefer $.click
[15:49:31] <Velveeta> it sounds to me like you don't have a lot of experience with forms yet...
[15:49:38] <cuqa> you just dont listen enough
[15:49:45] <cuqa> you are typing too much ;)
[15:49:53] <Velveeta> yeah, because i can type and read at the same time
[15:50:04] <cuqa> never said that im not gonna check the input once it has been submitted
[15:50:12] <Velveeta> so what you're saying is that you only want the browser to do your checking for required empty fields, and you don't want the server to do any validation
[15:50:21] <cuqa> no
[15:50:34] <cuqa> you just wanna hear that so you can tell me how much i suck :(
[15:50:36] <Velveeta> "cuqa: have to check for valid input once it has been submitted. dont wanna do that in php and additionally in jquery"
[15:50:46] <cuqa> yea
[15:50:52] <cuqa> you see that word additionally
[15:51:08] <Velveeta> right, so then *i* said do you want to check it in php *or* in jquery
[15:51:22] <Velveeta> and you said you were fine with a browser check
[15:51:40] <Velveeta> so that implies that you're fine doing only the browser check and not the server check
[15:51:42] <cuqa> php *or* jquery
[15:51:52] <cuqa> browsercheck is not part of that option
[15:52:03] <Velveeta> so then, you want to use just the browser native validation
[15:52:03] <cuqa> we just chatted a bit off each other :)
[15:52:10] <Velveeta> and nothing from jquery
[15:52:22] <cuqa> send me an email please
[15:52:25] <Velveeta> no thanks
[15:52:30] <Velveeta> what browsers do you want to support?
[15:52:38] <cuqa> not enough time to discuss this now but tomorrow i might have more time
[15:52:39] <Velveeta> because they don't all offer native validation
[15:53:08] <cuqa> i hope the people without native validation fuckin die
[15:53:16] <cuqa> they are the worst
[15:53:21] <Velveeta> that's all well and good, but until then, they're alive and kicking
[15:53:42] <cuqa> i might ban them by checking browser
[15:53:55] <Velveeta> and no, they're nowhere near the worst‚Ä¶ form validation is such a tiny little piece of functionality to write off, this whole conversation is ridiculous
[15:54:21] <Velveeta> robust form validation is nothing to add on top of native browser implementations and guarantee cross-browser
[15:54:29] <Velveeta> and it adds practically no overhead
[15:54:46] <Velveeta> this is just a lazy developer, or someone that doesn't have enough expierence with form validation
[15:55:41] <cuqa> i just want to make it comfortable for users to type in a form fastly
[15:55:54] <Velveeta> so javascript validation does nothing to impede that
[15:56:08] <cuqa> so they can instantly type in the same form again and create a column in the db
[15:56:23] <Velveeta> and again, javascript validation does nothing to impede that
[15:56:46] <cuqa> well, i wanna get the project done fastly too ;)
[15:56:56] <Velveeta> and again, javascript validation does nothing to impede that
[15:57:04] <Velveeta> you're talking about like 5 minutes worth of validation work
[15:57:05] <cuqa> if i make life easier for 95% of the people with 10 mins work
[15:57:31] <cuqa> i wont work 8 hours on a perfect validation to make life of IE6 users easier
[15:57:41] <Velveeta> it sounds like you're wasting more time trying to figure out how to get *around* writing a few lines of javascript, than it would have taken to write the javascript
[15:58:12] <Velveeta> you've been here for almost half an hour talking about it, you could have literally written a validator to do the work of native browser validation, in a cross-browser fashion, in less than 5 minutes
[15:58:49] <Velveeta> $('form').on('submit', function (e) { if ($(this).find('[required]:empty').length) { e.preventDefault(); });
[15:58:57] <Velveeta> that would probably do it
[15:59:03] <Velveeta> took me all of 30 seconds to write
[15:59:16] <cuqa> but you only check for empty :)
[15:59:24] <cuqa> does this trim input?
[15:59:27] <Velveeta> right, because you said required fields that were empty
[15:59:42] <cuqa> ok browser does this neither
[16:00:05] <cuqa> but lets say you have input type="number" or you have a pattern
[16:00:51] <Velveeta> if you're talking about validation patterns, those are html5 features, which IE 7 and 8 don't support i'm pretty sure, possibly not 9, according to caniuse.com
[16:01:02] <CeBe> hi, is there an alternative to the deprecated toggle() event? http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[16:01:06] <Velveeta> so you would *have* to provide a polyfill to add that functionality via javascript anyway
[16:01:16] <cuqa> maybe they will in the future. but yea its splitting hairs
[16:01:56] <Velveeta> when you're talking about not even supporting IE9, it's a little more than just splitting hairs now
[16:02:09] <Velveeta> a few minutes ago, your argument was wasting time to make IE6 users lives easier
[16:02:37] <Velveeta> i'm trying to tell you that native browser validation implementations are nowhere near as robust as a javascript layer on top of them, which would also guarantee cross-browser functionality
[16:03:01] <cuqa> ok, right. i keep that in mind
[16:03:08] <Velveeta> cebe: as far as i know, you'll have to use a click handler to manually toggle state on an element
[16:03:08] <cuqa> thanks for the discussion :)
[16:03:18] <cuqa> cuu
[16:03:28] <Velveeta> jesus christ, it was like talking to a wall with that guy
[16:03:48] <Velveeta> over something so simple to implement
[16:04:42] <CeBe> Velveeta: where do I best store the state or how do I track the state of the element?
[16:06:32] <Velveeta> cebe: i would just do it via a classname or something, like $('.someElement').on('click', function (e) { var $this = $(this); if ($this.hasClass('stateClass')) { doSomething(); $this.removeClass('stateClass'); } else { doSomethingElse(); $this.assClass('stateClass'); } });
[16:07:05] <CeBe> yeah sounds good, thanks!
[16:07:16] <Velveeta> no problemo
[16:13:46] <shoky> `api assClass
[16:13:46] <b-ot> shoky: No matches.
[16:17:48] <Velveeta> heheheh assClass
[17:30:11] <fattest> how can i make a mouse over effect on the left and right buttons that enables the gallery to slide animate left or night slowly? http://jsfiddle.net/BSwJn/77/
[17:30:42] <Ebonwumon> My password fields aren't firing .change events, while every other inputs are.
[17:30:47] <Ebonwumon> Is that intentional behavior?
[17:38:17] <Laire> My english isn't so good. I'm right, when I understand it, that this methode will be removed with 1.5 (jQuery mobile): http://api.jquerymobile.com/filterable/
[17:38:25] <Laire> ?
[17:42:50] <Velveeta> laire: according to those docs, yes, that's right
[17:45:54] <Laire> Velveeta: But how can I than use a filte on tables?
[18:20:31] <kandinski> I have a jquery plugin that just injects itself into the $ namespace, but I'd like to convert it to a format where it can be loaded via require() into a jquery instance that has also been loaded via require()
[18:20:44] <kandinski> exporting a function that extends $ and just executing it by require('myplugin')() seems like a very blunt option
[18:21:03] <kandinski> any suggestion for a better mechanism?
[18:51:13] <aberrant> hi all
[18:56:20] <aberrant> what does $.ajax(request) return? How does it get a .then() method?
[18:56:34] <aberrant> and is there a "noop" version of $.ajax that won't actually make a call?
[19:00:03] <shoky> aberrant: $.ajax returns a jqXHR which implements the promises/deferreds API
[19:00:55] <aberrant> shoky: ah, so I can create d = new jQuery.Deferred(); d.then(...); d.resolve() ?
[19:01:08] <shoky> yeah
[19:01:21] <aberrant> that's a noop, essentially.
[19:01:22] <aberrant> ok
[19:08:27] <aberrant> gah, not working as I expected.
[19:08:48] <shoky> `g eric hynds deferreds
[19:08:50] <b-ot> shoky: Using Deferreds in jQuery 1.5 - Eric Hynds ‚Üí http://www.erichynds.com/blog/using-deferreds-in-jquery
[19:08:59] <shoky> aberrant ^ recommended read
[19:10:02] <aberrant> I wish there were a way to do an ajax call that doesn't actually DO anything
[19:10:19] <aberrant> that is, it returns always successful, and immediately.
[19:10:28] <shoky> what for
[19:11:08] <aberrant> because I have this timing code that expects a URL, and it does an ajax request for it, but I just need the timing bit since I do the ajax call elsewhere.
[19:11:43] <shoky> wha
[19:12:30] <aberrant> yeah, it's not making much sense.
[19:13:19] <shoky> no idea what you're trying to do
[19:14:54] <coldhead> computer stuff
[19:15:17] <shoky> way above my paygrade
