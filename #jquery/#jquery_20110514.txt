[00:08:32] <jrockjiggz> L4suicide: i don't know regex, but just get $('b').html();  will get whatever is in them
[00:09:53] <L4suicide> problem im having is traversing to that element, the html is rubbish
[00:10:28] <L4suicide> I can find the <b> above it, but using .next doesn't seem to get the right one
[00:10:50] <L4suicide> then again I might be using the wrong thing.. .text wont do same as .html?
[00:11:26] <L4suicide> hrm, no i get null, where as with .text i get empty
[00:15:41] <L4suicide> hrm, i got something.. not sure it will work on whole page though
[00:16:43] <jrockjiggz> u should be able to traverse someway or another, text() will return the same as html() (minus any tags)
[00:18:05] <L4suicide> ah, ok, well yeah what I used doesn't work in the main page because it finds other <b> tags..
[00:18:40] <L4suicide> 66
[00:18:47] <L4suicide> http://jsfiddle.net/L4suicide/2MxRe/2/
[00:19:53] <L4suicide> the code is so horrible im not sure what the text im looking for resides in
[00:20:53] <L4suicide> is it a td?
[00:21:42] <jrockjiggz> what <b></b> do u want?
[00:22:11] <L4suicide> the one with the number in
[00:23:43] <L4suicide> heh.. $(':contains("Enter how much money")').parent().find('b:not(:contains("Be careful, you could lose"))');
[00:23:50] <L4suicide> I just took out the attempt to get the td, and went for any element that contained the right words
[00:24:04] <L4suicide> then its parent, and the next <b> without the wording i dont want :P
[00:24:25] <L4suicide> thanks for your guidence
[00:24:51] <gnarf> http://gnarf.net/2011/05/14/messing-with-jquery-color/
[00:26:14] <L4suicide> pah, that doesnt work with the rest of the html either :/
[00:27:33] <jrockjiggz> L4suicide: http://jsfiddle.net/2MxRe/3/
[00:30:08] <L4suicide> sweet, didn't think about testing it for numeracy like that
[00:32:52] <gnarf> lol http://jquery.org/updates/2011/05/13/irc-status-update-3/ <-- Whirl3d
[00:33:55] <paul_irish> :D
[00:38:29] <gnarf> paul_irish: worthy status update
[00:38:33] <paul_irish> thank you
[00:38:48] <gnarf> glad i flagged it
[00:38:49] <gnarf> ;)
[00:38:54] <emx> how do i set the selected attribute to selected? .attr() does not what i expect
[00:39:03] <gnarf> emx: jQuery 1.6?
[00:39:10] <gnarf> emx: use ?prop
[00:39:11] <emx> gnarf, yes
[00:39:11] <bot-t> emx, .prop() - Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[00:39:25] <jrockjiggz> ?selected
[00:39:25] <bot-t> :selected: Selects all elements that are selected. http://api.jquery.com/selected-selector/
[00:39:29] <jrockjiggz> oops no
[00:39:44] <jrockjiggz> attr('selected',true)
[00:40:08] <jrockjiggz> or attr('selected','selected');
[00:40:18] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: wrong way in 1.6
[00:40:29] <gnarf> in 1.6 .prop("selected", true)
[00:40:31] <jrockjiggz> oh
[00:40:34] <gnarf> in 1.6 .prop("selected", false)
[00:40:54] <jrockjiggz> thanks for the update
[00:41:21] <russian1> hello
[00:41:23] <Ely2> hi
[00:41:42] <Ely2> sup sean` :) today I can talk. Yesterday I was at work
[00:41:46] <Ely2> yes all fine with me .. you ? :D
[00:42:17] <russian1> could someone please let me know how to edit the left vertical js menu? http://exmuzic.ru/
[00:42:37] <russian1> to make it a fly-out css or js menu
[00:42:57] <russian1> any advice would be very appreciated
[00:47:07] <sean`> Ely2, wtf?
[00:47:24] <gnarf> sean`: you must be Ely2's after work boyfriend
[00:47:25] <Ely2> :lo
[00:47:31] <Ely2> : D
[00:48:52] <sean`> gnarf, it seems ilke it
[00:48:53] <emx> gnarf, i don't know what i am doing wrong but .prop() is not defined
[00:49:06] <gnarf> emx: then you must not be using 1.6?
[00:49:32] <gnarf> sean`: are you two gonna sexy chat now?
[00:49:36] <emx> gnarf, i downloaded the source a week ago
[00:49:46] <emx> it is 1.6
[00:49:53] <sean`> gnarf, all day long babe
[00:49:58] <gnarf> emx: console.log($.fn.prop)
[00:50:04] <dytrivedi> hehe
[00:50:28] <gnarf> does it exist?
[00:50:31] <Ely2> i was being polite ! :(
[00:50:38] <emx> gnarf, undefined
[00:50:47] <emx> attr is defined
[00:51:10] <gnarf> emx: how about console.log($.fn.jquery)
[00:51:17] <gnarf> that should be version number
[00:52:05] <russian1> the code says this http://jine.be/28
[00:52:27] <russian1> I totally don't get it, never worked with js before
[00:52:49] <emx> gnarf, funny. aloha has jquery 1.4.2 built in and overwrites my 1.6 :-/
[00:52:58] <gnarf> emx: win
[00:53:00] <gnarf> not 1.6
[00:53:19] <emx> i thought it only extends jquery but doesn't overwrite it. this is very bad news >(
[00:53:32] <emx> no wonder it takes so long to load pages
[00:53:50] <gnarf> Ely2: why u frown?
[00:53:57] <emx> and i thought it's a good choice. someone kick the developers
[00:58:08] <quentusrex> I'm trying to bind on a selectable event, and trying to pull an attr off of the object that was selected. Anybody know how to get the value in the attr?
[00:58:32] <gnarf> quentusrex: huh?
[00:58:42] <quentusrex> thing.bind( "selectableselected", function(event, ui) { ui.attr('thedata'); }); is not accessing the intended attr.
[00:58:50] <gnarf> ?selectable
[00:58:54] <bot-t> gnarf, UI/API/1.8/Selectable - The jQuery UI Selectable plugin allows for elements to be selected by dragging a box (sometimes called a lasso) with the mouse over the elements. Also, elements can be selected by click or drag whi... http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Selectable
[00:59:10] <gnarf> this.attr() ?
[00:59:57] <gnarf> the ui object is usually a list of properties like ui.item, etc
[01:00:00] <gnarf> console.dir() it
[01:00:05] <emx> does anyone know Ext?
[01:00:31] <quentusrex> gnarf, it was the this.attr(); thanks.
[01:00:33] <gnarf> if you want the element the widget was applied to, i think you're supposed to use this tho...
[01:01:10] <quentusrex> I'm trying to get a jquery reference to the dom object that was clicked.
[01:02:58] <quentusrex> actually, I was wrong. It fetches the selectable ui element, not the item that was selected.
[01:03:19] <gnarf> quentusrex: ui.item maybe?
[01:03:24] <gnarf> console.dir(ui)
[01:03:37] <gnarf> its usually not the bare "ui" object that is a jquery thing
[01:04:47] <b14ck> Can any of you tell me why this snippet of jquery won't work? http://pastie.org/1899558 I'm completely new to Jquery. I'm able to get the first alert to display, but not the second
[01:05:02] <b14ck> I'm basically trying to test and see if the page contains an element with an id of #wrapper.
[01:05:14] <b14ck> I've simplifed my test case down to this, I only get the first alert.
[01:05:19] <b14ck> I figure I'm messing someting up.
[01:05:38] <b14ck> I've also ensured that my page DOES contain an element (<div id="wrapper">) just to be sure.
[01:08:43] <quentusrex> gnarf, there appears not to be a ui.item
[01:08:53] <gnarf> quentusrex: what is on the ui object in that event?
[01:09:06] <gnarf> or have you still not console.dir(ui) ?
[01:09:57] <quentusrex> ui.selected
[01:09:59] <quentusrex> that was it.
[01:12:16] <quentusrex> gnarf, is there a way to save a jquery object into an attr for a dom object?
[01:12:43] <quentusrex> I keep getting: data="[object Object]"
[01:13:04] <emx> is or was there a function called .cookie()?
[01:15:25] <dytrivedi> no
[01:15:30] <dytrivedi> there's a plugin though
[01:15:32] <dytrivedi> ?cookie
[01:15:34] <bot-t> dytrivedi, Cookie | jQuery Plugins - A simple, lightweight utility plugin for reading, writing and deleting cookies. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/Cookie
[01:15:38] <dytrivedi> BUT
[01:15:42] <dytrivedi> use localstorage!

[01:16:25] <dytrivedi> ?cs
[01:16:26] <bot-t> cookies suck!
[01:19:37] <quentusrex> Is there a way to locate a dom element with a custom attribute with a particular value?
[01:20:42] <quentusrex> gnarf, I'm using data now to store the data, but now I'm trying to set an attribute to make li location easier in the ol.
[01:38:14] <L4suicide> test to see if you can use attr to display a known property, I imagine you are not referencing it right if attr() doesnt work to set an attr
[01:38:32] <L4suicide> hrm, just noticed my window is stuck way above lol
[01:38:48] * L4suicide fail
[01:46:36] <L4suicide> can I ignore JSLint when im doing this in a switch
[01:46:40] <L4suicide> case 'a':
[01:46:45] <L4suicide> case 'b':
[01:46:47] <L4suicide> break;
[01:46:55] <L4suicide> where i want case a to do items in case b too
[01:49:58] <L4suicide>  or even better.. if i switch(var) can i change var whilst switching?
[01:52:19] <Briareos1> I want to keep all jQuery code in one .js file - How can I best make sure certain things are only executed while in specific pages on the website?
[01:57:10] <merhaba> slm
[02:06:46] <gnarf> Briareos1: detect the elements on the page
[02:07:23] <Briareos1> okay, if that's sufficient (most efficient) gnarf
[02:07:38] <russian1> could someone advice how to make the fly-out menu fly to the left using onmousemove?
[02:07:43] <gnarf> Briareos1: id selectors are best
[02:07:50] <russian1> here's the link http://exmuzic.ru/
[02:08:05] <kutcha> hi
[02:08:07] <russian1> the menu to the left opens downwards onhover
[02:08:22] <russian1> I need it to open to the right
[02:08:31] <russian1> any thoughts please?
[02:11:00] <Briareos1> gnarf, would that work in order to only fetch the button.js, if the page contains a class called "google-buzz" ? $('.google-buzz').getScript('https://www.google.com/buzz/api/button.js')
[02:11:02] <kutcha> is it possible to give one jquery different menu items, so I can state items separately in html?
[02:11:25] <sean`> Briareos1, .getScript is not available for element
[02:11:25] <sean`> s
[02:11:32] <sean`> It's in the $ namespace, not the $.fn
[02:11:54] <gnarf> Briareos1: thats not keeping it in separate files
[02:11:55] <gnarf> but
[02:12:01] <sean`> Hamburger or eggs?
[02:12:03] <gnarf> if you must
[02:12:33] <gnarf> if ($('.google-buzz').length) $.getScript();
[02:12:34] <Briareos1> okay so something like if ($('.google-buzz')) { $.getScript(...) } ?
[02:12:48] <Briareos1> gnarf: ty :)
[02:12:50] <gnarf> but like i said
[02:12:54] <gnarf> id's are fastest usually
[02:13:05] <gnarf> #google-buzz would be better to search for
[02:13:06] <sean`> help me
[02:13:14] <gnarf> sean`: eggs
[02:13:17] <sean`> WHY
[02:13:18] <kutcha> In other words - can jquery menu items be a variables, which defines late ?
[02:13:33] <gnarf> sean`: because they are unborn babies
[02:13:36] <Briareos1> sure - I am just not 100 % sure yet, if I'll use it multiple times on a page
[02:13:37] <sean`> kutcha, what is a jquery menu item
[02:13:43] <sean`> gnarf, you sir
[02:13:48] <sean`> are a true genious
[02:14:44] <ravenzz> russian1 that's an css issue
[02:15:13] <russian1> now the menu flies out to the right but its all ruined http://exmuzic.ru/
[02:15:51] <russian1> is it css or html issue maybe?
[02:16:09] <ravenzz> of which menu you are talking about?
[02:16:15] <ravenzz> the one in the left sidebar?
[02:16:25] <russian1> yup
[02:16:27] <kutcha> sean`: I have only 3 or 4 element slide down menu - items are a links and simple statements
[02:16:27] <sean`> omg, why are you soo typical
[02:16:41] <sean`> Can't be you named "The_Pakistani" and be russian to surprise us
[02:16:42] <russian1> here's the code of the menu http://jine.be/30
[02:16:45] <ravenzz> it opens on click instead of hover
[02:17:00] <ravenzz> 1st of all
[02:17:03] <sean`> kutcha, got a demo?
[02:17:04] <ravenzz> tables sucks!
[02:17:23] <ravenzz> use lists for menus
[02:17:23] <russian1> I know, I've only been asked by a friend to make the fly-out menu
[02:17:41] <russian1> didn't develop this template myself
[02:17:51] <ravenzz> the you must set display:relative; on each menu item
[02:18:19] <russian1> the sub-items?
[02:18:29] <russian1> or every item?
[02:19:39] <russian1> maybe position:relative?
[02:19:56] <ravenzz> wait
[02:20:40] <russian1> now the gaps between the top items are just HUGE
[02:20:58] <russian1> the worst part is that i only have access to ftp. have to hurry :/
[02:21:51] <kutcha> sean`: I took menu from http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex1/flexdropdown.htm. But there they define each menu element in <li>...</li> tag. And then call them with data-flexmenu="somemenu1". I would like to pass item element. Is it possible?
[02:22:49] <kutcha> sean`: Sorry, if I was no clear enough
[02:22:56] <ravenzz> russian1 so. position:relative; to each <table>
[02:23:25] <ravenzz> i mean the ones that contain the 1st level item elements
[02:23:48] <ravenzz> then { position: absolute; left: 210px; width: 210px; background: white; }
[02:24:05] <ravenzz> to the 2nd tr of each table
[02:24:49] <russian1> there are no top-level TRs
[02:24:53] <russian1> there are divs
[02:24:55] <kutcha> sean`: I would like to define item elements like variables when function is called data-flexmenu="somemenu1" items="item1,item2,item3"
[02:25:09] <nanicoar> Github's 404s are <3.
[02:25:15] <russian1> the TR is used for the sub-items ravenzz
[02:25:21] <ravenzz> wait
[02:27:08] <ravenzz> russian1 http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3113573/themenu.png
[02:30:46] <russian1> changes sub-item TR to <tr style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;">
[02:30:54] <russian1> see what happened
[02:31:23] <ravenzz> anyway it's a css issue
[02:31:32] <ravenzz> forward your question to #css
[02:31:34] <russian1> should I undo that and make only the poition of the whole table absolute?
[02:31:50] <russian1> well you're right
[02:32:00] <russian1> thanks for your help. much appreciated )
[02:43:58] <tomh> hey is there an event in the autocomplete plugin triggered after it received data and displayed it to the user?
[03:05:34] <russian1> if the sub-menu flies out on onmousemove and then doesn't go away, what do I do to make it go away onmouseout?
[03:12:29] <tktiddle> Ive loaded the full jquery tools but I can use the $.overlay method, i keep getting the error "object has no method overlay"  can anyone suggest some debugging technique?
[03:15:28] <ravenz_> $('.foo').overlay();
[03:15:29] <ravenz_> ?
[03:18:40] <tktiddle> $('.foo').overlay; > undefined     $('.foo').tools;  > undefined ;  But the full jquerytools has been loaded.  Im wondering if theres some conflict with another js
[03:22:00] <ravenz_> .overlay()
[03:22:05] <ravenz_> is a function not a property
[03:22:53] <tktiddle> Still dosnt work though, I think its conflicting with another script
[03:23:05] <ravenz_> dunno
[03:23:20] <ravenz_> console.log($('.foo').overlay());
[03:23:32] <ravenz_> obivously .foo is a generic classname
[03:23:40] <ravenz_> you have to replace it with the one of your element
[03:31:39] <tktiddle> ravenz_: thanks I think the scripts were in the wrong order :s oops

[05:05:27] <ifndefx> What happened to jsfiddle and Jquery UI ? It no longer has an option to inlude the ui library
[05:05:28] <ifndefx> ?
[05:08:08] <ifndefx> I guess its only for 1.5.2 and below
[05:08:31] <sean`> ifndefx, #jsfiddle
[05:09:07] <ifndefx> thanks
[05:12:37] <ifndefx> just a quick question, with jquery ui sortable/draggable how do you change the element that is dragged onto the sortable : For example http://jsfiddle.net/rWrQU/ The Q1,Q2 can be dragged onto the sortable, when the q1/q2 is dragged onto the sortbale I want to replace the element to a custom div element.
[05:13:48] <sean`> ifndefx, there are drop events
[05:13:59] <sean`> you can catch the dropped element and then use replaceWIth
[05:16:39] <ifndefx> Hey sean` : I can't see a drop event for a sortable, I can only see stop event or receive event whcih seems to be close
[05:18:17] <sean`> ifndefx, your jsfiddle isn't even work
[05:18:18] <sean`> ing
[05:18:40] <ifndefx> are you sure, its working for me ?
[05:20:16] <ifndefx> I;ve taken out the placeholder option : http://jsfiddle.net/rWrQU/1/

[06:03:27] <illio> A very simple piece of JavaScript is failing in IE8 here.. On this site: https://services.brics.dk/java/evaluationadmin/ea/showEvaluationForm?id=4&preview=true&token= .. Specifically the Add comment part.. apparently it isn't roling out in IE8 and the code is just: "$('div.button_showcomment').click(function() { $(this).next('.ea_question_comment').show('slow');$(this).hide(); });" .. any idea why this happens?
[06:13:40] <JmZ> hey
[06:13:56] <JmZ> would it be possible to alter where a link goes in the click event?
[06:14:17] <JmZ> so if I click a link to abc.com, in the click event change it to xyz.com before the user is sent to it
[06:14:36] <emx> JmZ, i would do: event.preventDefault(). window.location = yourtarget;
[06:14:42] <JmZ> i know you can do window.location and preventDefault() but it won't work if you want to keep the whole _blank thing intact
[06:15:43] <emx> what does target _blank affect? i forgot.
[06:15:56] <JmZ> new window/tab
[06:16:19] <emx> you can open a new window with javascript, set its dimension and define the location
[06:16:24] <JmZ> whatever the user has their browser setup to do for that, which is one of those two usually
[06:16:30] <JmZ> yeah but thats a window/popup then
[06:16:31] <emx> (at least you could 10 years ago :P)
[06:16:42] <JmZ> what if the user has their browser setup to open _blank links in new tabs
[06:16:57] <emx> JmZ, that's up to the user, you can't affect that
[06:17:10] <JmZ> you just did, by saying make a new window with JS
[06:17:22] <jonee> That's the default behavior for firefox- nothing you can do about it
[06:17:24] <JmZ> if you create a popup in JS, it is always a popup, not a new tab, regardless of what the user has set
[06:17:32] <emx> JmZ, you can set up the browser to open new windows in a tab
[06:17:58] <JmZ> how do you think popunders and such work? because JS doesn't interact with tabs like that
[06:18:16] <JmZ> which is why I asked if there's a way to alter the href/location without interfering with how the link 'works'
[06:18:40] <emx> JmZ, i know to little about it. maybe you can set the attribute href to the desired target URL...
[06:19:12] <jonee> _blank behaviour is browser dependent?
[06:19:48] <JmZ> nobody said that, _blank will open a tab or window depending on the user's settings/configuration
[06:19:58] <JmZ> whereas a JS popup will always be.. a JS popup
[06:20:13] <emx> i don't know if it is defined. _new usually opens a new window, _top is the top most frame. but it depends how it is implemented and i wouldn't  be surprised if it is freestyle.
[06:20:29] <solars> hey, does anyone know if there is a plugin to draw or add predefined symbols to particular images? preferrable a layer above the image?
[06:20:30] <KeeperOfTheSoul> JmZ: doesn't have to be, I can set some browsers to always open popups in new tabs regardless of how they are created
[06:21:09] <JmZ> KeeperOfTheSoul: even if that's true, this entire issue remains
[06:21:20] <JmZ> how to change where the link goes without altering how it is opened
[06:21:38] <JmZ> GOT IT
[06:21:38] <emx> JmZ, did you try setting href within the called event handler?
[06:22:11] <JmZ> you can call .click() on a link, right
[06:22:24] <KeeperOfTheSoul> JmZ: why do you even need to do this, sounds like an odd requirement
[06:22:32] <JmZ> so how about have a separate link to the new location with _blank, preventDefault and then .click() the other link
[06:23:11] <ifndefx> hi can someone run this and have a look at your console... the error count is growing exponentially.
[06:24:06] <emx> >>> this
[06:24:06] <emx> Window edit
[06:24:08] <ifndefx> http://jsfiddle.net/rWrQU/3/ is this a bug ?
[06:25:19] <geekbuntu> ? i drug q1 & q2 to the box under the word block and it disabled like the script said to?
[06:25:22] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: actually, the error count is growing linearly, and something looks wrong here
[06:26:14] <ifndefx> yeah you're right that it isn't exponentially, it was only a figure of speech... but it is wierd isn't it ?
[06:26:47] <solars> is there anything like image annotate that lets me add symbols to images?
[06:27:28] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: looks like this.helper has been nulled out, yet its still trying to use it
[06:28:07] <ifndefx> I don't think I've touched the helper...
[06:29:12] <JmZ> hmm that didnt go too well the .click idea
[06:29:22] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: its jquery, on line 3915 it sets this.helper = null
[06:29:47] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: then on line 3920 it calls your callback, which throws an exception due to asdasd not being defined
[06:30:05] <ifndefx> KeeperOfTheSoul: I think I've got it, its the alert and asdasdasd
[06:30:15] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: it must not be handling that exception, so later when it tries to clear the trigger or what ever its doing, it just throws, which then immediatly tries to clear the trigger, ...
[06:30:22] <danielss89> i'm trying to check if 2 passwords are the same...: http://pastebin.com/9XtCE3pS
[06:30:29] <ifndefx> oh yup, you got it too
[06:30:29] <danielss89> it works, but if they were not the same, and then the user makes them the same, then the UL isnt removed...
[06:30:39] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: true, but also, jquery should be handling errors within the callback and cleaning up its state correctly
[06:31:20] <ifndefx> Is that a bug ?
[06:31:29] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: I'd say it was
[06:32:11] <ifndefx> ok cool.
[06:32:15] <ifndefx> thanks KeeperOfTheSoul
[06:33:36] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: certainly worth registering on the bug tracker, even if its only low priority
[06:33:53] <KeeperOfTheSoul> assuming someone else hasn't already logged it
[06:34:11] <ifndefx> Going to be my first time filing a bug report, I'll give it a go. Is it on the Ui or jquery ?
[06:34:28] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: though I'd replace alert(asdasd) with a straight forward throw "an exception!"
[06:34:43] <emx> ifndefx, have fun :P
[06:34:45] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: jquery-ui
[06:35:23] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: the bug is if the placeholder stop callback throws, the jquery ui's state becomes corrupted
[06:36:25] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: though you might want to check against the latest jquery and jquery ui first, might already be fixed in a newer version
[06:37:22] <ifndefx> I think its the latest ui, but maybe not the latest Jquery core.
[06:37:41] <KeeperOfTheSoul> probably valid then if its latest ui
[06:38:32] <Klevre> I've a list of elements where some of the items are dynamically hidden, how do I get the last child element that is not hidden?
[06:39:08] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: the line responsible is line 3917
[06:39:44] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: you can see that by placing a breakpoint on show, line 46 (the alert statement) and looking at the stacktrace
[06:40:16] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: that's the part that nulls out the helper
[06:40:44] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: though it is line 3921 that's failing to trap the exception
[06:41:31] <KeeperOfTheSoul> not sure what should be done about it though, it doesn't look trivial to fix
[06:42:01] <ifndefx> how did you get to the stack ?
[06:42:18] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: in the debugger (chrome) I have a call stack window
[06:42:43] <zjk> hi when i use firebug to check jquery object i got a small "letter" like icone aside jQuery( a <here>)
[06:42:44] <KeeperOfTheSoul> firebug provides a similar function
[06:43:04] <ifndefx> ahh ok, I'm using firebug but I;'m not sure if it has a view of the stack
[06:43:13] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: it does
[06:43:17] <zjk> what it means ?
[06:43:43] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: should be over on the right in the script debugger
[06:43:58] <KeeperOfTheSoul> ifndefx: only shows up when the script is paused on a breakpoint
[06:44:07] <ifndefx> yup got it..
[06:44:13] <ifndefx> never noticed that there
[06:45:00] <zjk> +>
[06:45:07] <zjk> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/804/jquery.png/
[06:45:38] <zjk> someone know what it means ?
[06:46:53] <emx> the jquery object containing an anchor has got mail
[06:47:10] <zjk> lol no it doesn't ^^
[06:47:24] <zjk> or maybe "jquery is sending a mail" :)
[06:47:25] <edbaffei> hi why is this not a 'POST'  when i gets to the server
[06:47:28] <edbaffei> http://dpaste.com/542420/
[06:47:54] <edbaffei> looking at the accesslogs on the server it says 'GET'
[06:48:06] <KeeperOfTheSoul> zjk: what browser is that from?
[06:48:33] <zjk> KeeperOfTheSoul: Firefox and firebug module
[06:49:48] <KeeperOfTheSoul> edbaffei: is there a server side redirect in response to the original POST?
[06:50:42] <zjk> KeeperOfTheSoul: ok i thin k the first iteration is <a> object, then the second the "letterbox" tell us that the <a> has an event on (i guess)
[06:51:03] <edbaffei> KeeperOfTheSoul: no.. expects a post
[06:51:33] <KeeperOfTheSoul> edbaffei: just wondering, as if you redirect a post, some browsers issue a GET to the target location rather than re-issueing the post
[06:51:55] <Briareos1> I know how to add normal functions with parameters - however, how can i add a custom method like this: $('.do-something-with-me').attachCustomFunction()   ?
[06:52:12] <edbaffei> KeeperOfTheSoul: hmm.. ok .. thnz
[06:54:04] <KeeperOfTheSoul> edbaffei: that only matters if 127.0.0.1:8000/v1/items/ is sending a redirect response (eg, a 30x)
[06:55:36] <hobs> gnarf: I dreamnt of unicorns
[06:55:41] <zjk> anyone know why .each return each matched item then at the end the whole list ?
[06:57:50] <zjk> http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/339/jquery.png/
[07:06:53] <zjk> i do $(#menu a).each(function(){console.log($(this));})
[07:07:21] <zjk> console.log output each "a" object then at the end the whole list !
[07:07:57] <zjk> so each bind is done twice
[07:07:58] <zjk> so weird
[07:09:43] <zjk> pff ok
[07:09:48] <nail_> zjk: you mean in the console?
[07:10:02] <nail_> the whole list is what #('#menu a') returns
[07:10:32] <zjk> yes but i didn't saw that another dev has instanciate the same function in another part of the code

[08:01:39] <dchelimsky> but the 2nd statement won't work if the first statement doesn't find any elements
[08:01:53] <dchelimsky> any suggestions?

[08:47:30] <jroes> I have an element I'm not adding to the DOM until a later time, what's the standard way of setting up an event handler for that element? should I use jQuery.live, should I set up the event handler after I add it, or is there another option even?
[08:47:47] <zjk> .live is quite good for this
[08:48:12] <jroes> cool, wasn't sure if that was really only to be used in more extreme cases

[09:56:49] <Satya> hi.. i want to use jquery in a html website.. do i need to download or link anything for my jquery script to work?
[09:57:12] <ajpiano> symaxian, there's #jquerymobile but it's kinda quiet usually, but you should try first there
[09:57:14] <ezrafree> hello
[09:57:17] <symaxian> you have to link to jQuery, either a remote or local copy
[09:57:17] <ajpiano> but like i said probably quite quiet on a weekend
[09:57:25] <friskd> Hey all, i'm running this code:  $('body').append("<div id='"+tZone+"' class='tooltip'></div>");
[09:57:28] <ajpiano> Satya: you have to include jquery
[09:57:30] <ezrafree> how can i update the contents of a div?
[09:57:34] <friskd> its in a loop wher tZone
[09:57:38] <friskd> is a new uuid
[09:58:02] <Satya> ajpiano: how to do that? any link for reference code??
[09:58:06] <friskd> what is really weird, is that if after each append i do a : var body = $('.tooltip');
[09:58:09] <ajpiano> Suikwan, it's a timestampt, is how it relates to it being a timestamp
[09:58:20] <friskd> i only ever see two tooltips...
[09:58:32] <friskd> yet the loop cycles at least 20 times..
[09:58:47] <friskd> Is there something wrong w/ how i am appending new divs to the body
[09:58:48] <ravenzz> friskd code?
[09:58:56] <ravenzz> jsfiddle.net
[09:59:21] <ajpiano> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.js"></script> Suikwan
[09:59:37] <ajpiano> i mean Satya ^^
[09:59:54] <ajpiano> Suikwan: that number that it gives you is the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970
[09:59:56] <friskd> ravenzz:
[09:59:56] <friskd> http://jsfiddle.net/LnVXA/
[09:59:58] <ajpiano> which is "Unix Time"
[10:00:02] <Suikwan> ajpiano...maybe I didnt phrase my question correctly.  when I ran the command I got 1305391246494.  how can I get a date and time (yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss) out of that?
[10:00:04] <Satya> ajpiano: thank you so much
[10:00:11] <symaxian> equivalent to "new Date().getTime()"
[10:00:21] <friskd> ravenzz:  that function gets called about 20 times.
[10:00:30] <ajpiano> Suikwan: you have to probably use a date lib or some sort,
[10:00:37] <ajpiano> of*
[10:00:50] <ajpiano> Suikwan, you shouldn't use jQuery.now() if you don't want it as a tmiestamp
[10:00:54] <ajpiano> you could just do new Date()
[10:01:19] <ajpiano> to get a date Object
[10:01:20] <friskd> I added : var body = $('.tooltip');
[10:01:29] <friskd> just to see how many tooltips where on the page...
[10:01:32] <ajpiano> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date Suikwan
[10:01:51] <friskd> it always only ever showed 2....
[10:01:56] <friskd> they where always chaning...
[10:02:00] <IanWizard> I forget, what's the preferred way to get the current file name?  For submitting a form to it using AJAX POST.
[10:02:02] <friskd> *changing.
[10:02:09] <Suikwan> ok, what I'm trying to do is compare a callback date/time entered by a representative to now() to make sure the date/time is in the future
[10:02:14] <Suikwan> ajpiano
[10:02:17] <ajpiano> ok
[10:02:27] <ajpiano> so just use the timestamps and compare the numeric value
[10:02:27] <friskd> But if i just called that function 20 times i would have expected to see an array filled w/ tooltips... continually incrementing by 1.
[10:02:36] <ajpiano> higher number == later
[10:03:09] <IanWizard> *current filename / url
[10:03:16] <IanWizard> either way.
[10:03:43] <ravenzz> friskd http://jsfiddle.net/5vM6Z/
[10:04:06] <ajpiano> IanWizard window.location.pathname or other stuf in the window.location object
[10:04:45] <IanWizard> oh, so there's not a better "jQuery way"?
[10:05:00] <ajpiano> nope
[10:05:17] <IanWizard> ajpiano: ok, well.. Thanks :D
[10:05:53] <friskd> ravenzz:  how is that any different from how i am doing it?
[10:05:53] <cm> I'm trying to make a tab autocomplete for my IRC client (written in js etc), but am unsure how I would tell where the cursor is. How would I go about doing this?
[10:06:45] <symaxian> Anyone work with mobile? the data-backbtw="false" isnt disabling the back button.
[10:06:55] <symaxian> backbtn*
[10:07:13] <ravenzz> friskd i'm not familiar with templates
[10:07:20] <friskd> o
[10:07:21] <friskd> ok
[10:09:00] <Kre10s> cm, you could track key events.
[10:09:24] <cm> Oh dear, that sounds complicated :(
[10:11:36] <symaxian> You mean the text cursor?
[10:11:48] <ajpiano> cm, you can use the jCaret plugin to work with where the caret is in textareas
[10:12:51] <ajpiano> symaxian, i don't see data-backbtw="false" as a config option, can you show me where you see that?
[10:13:10] <symaxian> a few posts, one saying it works with alpha 3
[10:13:16] <symaxian> http://www.designscripting.com/2011/02/header-without-back-button-in-jquery-mobile-remove-back-button-mobile-jquery/
[10:15:05] <cm> ajpiano: Does that work with ordinary text inputs, too?
[10:15:10] <ajpiano> oh yep
[10:17:26] <IanWizard> l8r
[10:20:39] <wathek> Hi all I got a problem with fancybox I'm trying to close it from it's content but it doesn't work here it is : http://extranet.draconismedia.com/clients/rayek2/ the gray button (Non Merci) should close the fancybox how ever it doesn't work
[10:21:27] <symaxian> How can I run a script after jQuery mobile parses and loads in an external page?
[10:21:36] <symaxian> It doesn't seem to parse the script tags
[10:28:11] <imsky> no bot-t?
[10:28:14] <imsky> this is an outrage!
[10:28:18] <imsky> also an outage
[10:29:36] <Satya> i am trying to load content into a div from html file
[10:30:10] <Satya> i am using  $('').load(filepath) .. but not working.. anything wrong with this logic?
[10:30:11] <imsky> ?load @ satya
[10:30:17] <imsky> dammit
[10:30:20] <imsky> forgot
[10:30:38] <imsky> Satya: are you doing this on a live server?
[10:30:44] <Satya> yes
[10:30:55] <imsky> Satya: can you paste your actual code
[10:31:31] <Satya> function loadcontent(filename){   alert(filename);     $('#Content').load("http://www.my-endeavors.com/".filename);
[10:31:32] <Satya> }
[10:31:46] <Satya> alert is giving correct file name ..
[10:31:52] <imsky> o_O
[10:31:59] <imsky> you have "url".filename?
[10:32:02] <imsky> this isn't php
[10:32:08] <imsky> "url"+filename
[10:32:13] <Satya> opps... so stupid.. sorry.......
[10:32:19] <Satya> oops*
[10:32:39] <senn_> any reason why $('button.save').click(function(e) { alert(1); }); would fire two alerts when clicked?
[10:32:58] <imsky> senn_: pastebin the rest of your code
[10:33:45] <Satya> imsky: thank you so much..
[10:33:50] <imsky> yw buddy
[10:34:56] <senn_> imsky http://pastebin.com/B2qgXgXU
[10:34:57] <BlaDe^> Hi guys. I'm creating multiple file uploads and I have an <a ...><input type="file" name="uploads[]" /> Add more files</a>
[10:35:14] <BlaDe^> I then add a new row to a table with that file and I do var t = $(this).clone().hide(); and append it to the row
[10:35:46] <BlaDe^> in Firefox, as expected, it clones the file object and stores it. In Chrome however, it seems to give a pointer to the object and only the last file works
[10:35:55] <BlaDe^> the first few don't upload. Did I explain that okay?
[10:36:16] <senn_> even if I changed it to a input with the type of button it throws the alert twice.... in fx and chrome
[10:37:03] <senn_> see anything wrong imsky ?
[10:37:13] <senn_> what's the site where you paste the html with js
[10:37:33] <senn_> got it, jsfiddle
[10:38:10] <imsky> senn_: try this: $(General.config.saveButton).each(function(){$(this).click(function(e){
[10:38:27] <BlaDe^> any ideas about my Q, guys?
[10:40:24] <imsky> BlaDe^: have you tried being less lazy? just append the html template for each row instead
[10:40:35] <imsky> clone, i think, needs some work-arounds with bound events and such
[10:40:44] <BlaDe^> imsky it does append the html template for each row
[10:40:53] <BlaDe^> imsky in firefox it works fine, but in chrome it doesn't
[10:41:05] <imsky> so why do you use clone?
[10:41:09] <senn_> imsky still throws it twice
[10:41:21] <imsky> senn_: damn, put it on jsfiddle lol
[10:41:59] <BlaDe^> imsky: because I want to retain the "browse" button without adding it to my table
[10:42:01] <BlaDe^> imsky: http://pastie.org/private/fm3lkusebsapydg9pqljtg
[10:42:10] <imsky> o_O
[10:43:24] <imsky> BlaDe^: ok don't use clone at all
[10:43:29] <imsky> write your code without using it
[10:43:42] <BlaDe^> imsky then how can I do it? It's a webkit bug. It works fine in Firefox/Opera
[10:43:52] <imsky> don't..use clone?
[10:44:06] <BlaDe^> yes, but how can I do it withotu clone?
[10:45:17] <imsky> you have something like <input type="file"> yes?
[10:45:29] <imsky> so just put that in a js variable and append the variable as many times as you like
[10:45:47] <senn_> imsky http://jsfiddle.net/
[10:45:52] <imsky> yes, yes
[10:45:55] <imsky> that's the site
[10:46:01] <senn_> seems to only fire once here with cut down version
[10:46:03] <senn_> strange
[10:46:20] <digga> hey, I have a simple jquery drop down that works on all pages except for one, that uses a wordpress ajax comments plugin. It returns '$blala is null' , the page is here working: http://adverse-ads.com/buyii/ , and here is with the plugin where not working: http://adverse-ads.com/buyii/Perth/perthandgol/ it's the "choose a city" on top right
[10:46:34] <imsky> senn_: uh oh
[10:47:40] <senn_> :(
[10:47:50] <imsky> lol paste the link
[10:49:04] <senn_> ok now I'm going insane
[10:49:10] <imsky> welcome to #jquery
[10:49:13] <senn_> it isnt doing it twice
[10:49:16] <imsky> yeap
[10:49:20] <senn_> after changing to jquery 15.2
[10:49:25] <senn_> 1.5.2
[10:49:27] <imsky> good times
[10:49:28] <senn_> it was running 1.3.2
[10:49:31] <senn_> odd
[10:49:44] <senn_> no ill put all the other html back in place and try
[10:51:01] <alexparker> how do you undo or remove a css that you set with $(this).css('backgkround', 'rules');
[10:51:13] <imsky> $(this).css("background","");
[10:52:09] <senn_> or $item.attr('style','');
[10:52:09] <alexparker> oh man
[10:52:10] <alexparker> haha
[10:52:30] <imsky> senn_: that would destroy all inline css
[10:52:33] <alexparker> senn_: cant do that cuz there are other property's in the style attr
[10:52:41] <alexparker> imsky i'm embarassed haha
[10:52:51] <imsky> alexparker: no worries mate, we all had that moment ;)
[10:52:58] <alexparker> i was trying css('background', false) or css('background', nul)
[10:52:59] <senn_> alessio_alex sometimes you might want to do that
[10:53:13] <senn_> alexparker*
[10:53:23] <alexparker> senn_: yes thats possible
[10:53:49] <senn_> doesnt setting it to '' default to 0 ?
[10:53:55] <senn_> so for things like height/width its bad
[10:54:02] <senn_> you are better to remove the style tag
[10:56:37] <BlaDe^> $start.find(".new_file").change(function(){ <----- if I .removeClass("new_file") and add it to another element, will that event listener update?
[10:57:59] <imsky> yep
[10:59:23] <BlaDe^> it doesn't seem to be, hold on
[11:00:08] <BlaDe^> nope it isn't. It doesn't trigger again
[11:00:36] <imsky> haha wait
[11:00:50] <imsky> $start.find(".new_file").live("change",function(){
[11:00:52] <imsky> that'll do 'er
[11:01:15] <BlaDe^> thankyou :D
[11:08:35] <emx> i want to get an ancestor of a node by calling .parents() with the appropriate selector. for some reason i don't get the element i want, although it is an ancestor of the element in question. why could this be (v1.4.2)
[11:11:52] <imsky> emx: why don't you paste your markup and js
[11:12:46] <Abjorn> LOL imsky
[11:12:46] <Abjorn> http://webscripts.softpedia.com/script/Multimedia/3D-Graphics/jQuery-Wiggle--68822.html

[11:14:10] <Abjorn> im listening to...whatever comes on pandora
[11:14:21] <Abjorn> which is, right now, a remix of the james bond theme
[11:14:33] <imsky> word
[11:14:35] <imsky> i think
[11:14:39] <imsky> could be a crappy remix
[11:15:01] <Abjorn> its decent
[11:15:33] <Abjorn> im on Minibosses radio its like mostly old school video game music remixes/covers and classical music/rock orchestra
[11:15:53] <imsky> son
[11:16:07] <imsky> use that gr00v3shark
[11:16:52] <Abjorn> nah i like my pandora
[11:17:05] <imsky> did they upgrade from flash yet
[11:19:42] <Abjorn> no
[11:19:50] <ziz_> would someone be ever so helpful and tell me why this jquery slider isn't working on my page.. I'm using wordpress, but it didn't download a plugin, I got a template that included the .js files and the html & css, but the slider isn't working... www.six5webdesign.com/portfolio is where I am trying it, and the site that has the slider is  http://chocotemplates.com/demo/?template=portfolio-3
[11:19:52] <Abjorn> my sister got me pandora one for chistmas tho so i use it
[11:20:21] <imsky> what's pandora one
[11:20:46] <Abjorn> eh the paid service where you have unlimited listening and theres a desktop application you can use instead of using it through a browser
[11:21:47] <imsky> go to http://ro.me in chrome
[11:23:20] <PrgmrBill> what am I doing wrong if I clone an existing element and append it and see "[object]"
[11:23:25] <PrgmrBill> I want it to show the html of that element
[11:23:48] <systemfault> imsky: Oh shit.
[11:24:05] <imsky> systemfault: did you experience a system fault?
[11:24:11] <ravenzz> ziz_ you miss some css
[11:24:28] <ziz_> just added it
[11:24:31] <ziz_> refresh please

[11:27:08] <ravenzz> you don't upload the images/next.gif and images/prev.gif
[11:28:28] <ravenzz> then you probably would contain the content into a wrapper
[11:29:51] <ravenzz> ziz_ oh seems that #main is the container..so wrap the slider into it
[11:29:51] <imsky> who's getting a chromebook

[11:38:40] <imsky> lololol
[11:38:47] <imsky> i used to live like 3 hours from helsinki
[11:38:55] <vysical> i want an a-tag to submit a form but prevent form sending by pressing enter. i created an event handler for submit with just "return false;" but it's also called when i submit the form by .submit(); when the a-tag click handler fires..
[11:38:56] <imsky> good times yo!
[11:39:20] <mysphyt> vysical: I think you probably want event.preventDefault.
[11:39:57] <wkmanire> I can't remember, will a form submit with the enter key if it does not have an input type="submit" in it?
[11:40:04] <imsky> yeap
[11:41:52] <agentgasmask> Hi all. I'm trying to use a value from the PHP _POST array in a javascript if/then statement. How can I access the array from javascript/jquery?
[11:42:00] <mysphyt> vysical: Can you do something like function(event) { event.preventDefault; if ($(this).is('a')) { //do something } else {return false})};?
[11:42:06] <imsky> agentgasmask: you can never do that
[11:42:23] <imsky> never ever
[11:42:24] <mysphyt> (jQuery: for people who really love end punctuation.)
[11:42:42] <ajpiano> event.preventDefault() is a method :p
[11:42:58] <imsky> Abjorn: where u go man
[11:43:12] <mysphyt> agentgasmask: PHP is server side; Javascript is client side.  Clients don't have access to the server data like $_POST, $_SESSION, etc.
[11:43:37] <mysphyt> agentgasmask: If there's a value (non-sensitive) that you want to pass to javascript, you can have your PHP file generate javascript, or return a JSON string, etc.
[11:44:00] <mysphyt> ajpiano: Gah, fine.  Nitpick whydontcha.
[11:44:20] <imsky> capitalize gah, punctuate a two word sentence
[11:44:24] <imsky> but write "whydontcha"
[11:44:28] <necromancer> agentgasmask: the latter is preferred, especially when dealing with uploading files...
[11:44:30] <imsky> INCONSISTENT OUTRAGE!
[11:44:30] <agentgasmask> mysphyt: Yes, how can I return a JSON string? Can you point me to some docs/tutorial?
[11:44:34] <kitikonti> i want a .click action to hide elements, but how i take as selector the element i clicked on?
[11:44:38] * mysphyt is an English teacher.
[11:44:39] <necromancer> `ref api $.ajax
[11:44:44] <necromancer> `ref ajax
[11:44:45] <ajpiano> lol, not nitpcking, just trying to make sure he gets the intended result :)
[11:44:48] <necromancer> boobs
[11:44:57] <mysphyt> I get to make up my own rules.  It's the law.
[11:44:58] <imsky> mysphyt: i think all of my anal-retentive friends who capitalize and punctuate 1-word sentences are english teachers then
[11:45:06] <imsky> or at least they qualify
[11:45:26] <necromancer> agentgasmask: look up $.ajax on the jQuery API: http://api.jquery.com
[11:45:36] <ajpiano> i am good friends with this woman who was my student teacher of english in 8th grade
[11:45:44] <mysphyt> I wrote an essay once that included an IM conversation with my wife (also an English teacher).  Everyone in my workshop refused to believe it because it was properly capitalized and punctuated throughout.
[11:45:49] <ajpiano> she dropped using proper punctutation in IMs once i graduated HS
[11:45:54] <necromancer> agentgasmask: on the PHP side you want to look up json_encode()
[11:45:59] <imsky> yeah man
[11:46:10] <imsky> the internet != essay
[11:46:12] <necromancer> agentgasmask: but if you want more PHP help you might want to check out ##php
[11:46:22] <agentgasmask> necromancer: $.ajax receves json_encode data?
[11:46:33] <mysphyt> agentgasmask: Sorry, was busy cracking wise.  But json_encode() is what you want in PHP.
[11:46:50] <necromancer> agentgasmask: yeah it can, just set your dataType: 'json'
[11:47:03] <wkmanire> It doesn't take that much longer to write correctly. If you always do it the same way, when it comes to time to actually write something formal you'll have a lot less corrections to make.
[11:47:05] <agentgasmask> necromancer: Ok, Thanks, I'll check that out.
[11:47:08] <necromancer> agentgasmask: make sure to have the PHP file return the proper HTTP headers for serving JSON. a quick google search should turn up what that is
[11:47:10] <wkmanire> But that is just my opinion.
[11:47:11] <mysphyt> agentgasmask: $.ajax receives whatever it gets sent.  If you use a $.ajax request to fetch a page that returns json data, you can process that data into a script.
[11:47:18] <imsky> wkmanire: Yes. A thousand times yes. No! No!
[11:47:19] <agentgasmask> mysphyt: np, thanks for your help.
[11:47:29] <ajpiano> mysphyt: i like to think of the grammar free confines of internet conversations as a physical manifestation of the collegiality and impromptu nature of those communications
[11:47:37] <ajpiano> wkmanire: i've never had trouble
[11:47:40] <imsky> ajpiano: otherwise known as HERP DERP
[11:47:42] <random123> Hello fellow creatures spawned on a rock traveling 67,000 miles an hour around incandescent gas
[11:47:51] <wkmanire> ajpiano: :)
[11:47:51] <necromancer> wkmanire: i don't think that's true, i find it much easier to type without using shifts because my hands can freely migrate over the keyboard. but i don't really spend that much time correcting on formal essays/emails i'm wirting
[11:47:56] <imsky> random123: hello fellow creature, we'll eventually die
[11:48:00] <necromancer> wkmanire: YMMV though, everyone's different
[11:48:04] <random123> lol
[11:48:07] <ajpiano> imsky i just tried to play HERP in words with friends and i was rejected
[11:48:14] <necromancer> haha herp derp
[11:48:20] <imsky> ajpiano: your friend is not HIP enough for HERP
[11:48:29] <mysphyt> ajpiano: For sure.  From a rhetorical perspective, using academic English spelling and punctuation as I do is really a violation of discursive convention--which is why it's perfectly appropriate for imsky to mock me for doing so.
[11:48:39] <imsky> yeah asshole
[11:48:43] <wkmanire> necromancer: How often do your hands migrate?
[11:48:50] <mysphyt> Ino, rite?
[11:48:53] <imsky> "For sure." lololol
[11:48:55] <ajpiano> mysphyt: haha really going the extra mile there
[11:49:15] <gnarf> i really wish i knew what frickin movie my roommate left on the tv
[11:49:25] <imsky> gnarf: send us a screenshot
[11:49:27] <gnarf> there are like cheerleaders, strippers, and lots of boobs
[11:49:29] <ajpiano> mysphyt: Your penultimate message to this channel enlivens in me a deep desire to accompany in this rarefied station.
[11:49:36] <PrgmrBill> how can I get the HTML of an element, not just its value?
[11:49:37] * wkmanire is an emacs user and is not afraid of hitting control or shift keys regularly.
[11:49:39] <wkmanire> he he he
[11:49:39] <ajpiano> you*
[11:49:48] <mysphyt> ajpiano: This is my wheelhouse, baby.  I may be a jQuery noob, but I'm a rhetorical greybeard.
[11:49:48] <imsky> PrgmrBill: for what
[11:49:52] <PrgmrBill> for example a textarea, when i use html() I get the text between its opening closing tag
[11:49:53] <gnarf> one of the chearleading teams is "The Beavers"
[11:50:02] <PrgmrBill> I want <textarea etc
[11:50:04] <mysphyt> PrgmrBill: $(elem).html()?
[11:50:06] <ajpiano> mysphyt: haha same deal, i am way better at english than javascripts
[11:50:06] <wkmanire> gnarf: Oh no :(
[11:50:11] <imsky> i'm doesn't afraid of anything!
[11:50:14] <ajpiano> javascript has more $$$$$
[11:50:22] <imsky> $.$.$.$.$.$.$.$
[11:50:27] <imsky> more of that
[11:50:27] <imsky> you mean
[11:50:56] <necromancer> wkmanire: well it's just that when i'm typing lowercase my hands don't have to keep going back to shift. Like if I typed a sentence like This with a Lot of Capital Words I notice the Amount of Time it Takes me to go back and hit Shift is a Little Longer than if i were to just type in all lowercase. :)
[11:51:08] <necromancer> although not by much, admittedly.
[11:51:11] <imsky> People Who Capitalize Every Word Seem Illiterate To Me
[11:51:14] <ajpiano> mysphyt: also a thousand times over i can not begin to express my affection for the word "wheelhouse"
[11:51:31] <mysphyt> ajpiano: I <3 words.
[11:51:34] <ajpiano> imsky: true that though, excessive capitalisation is a dead giveaway
[11:51:35] <necromancer> imsky: balderdash! i joke with my boss that the only reason we use PHP and jQuery in the office is because he likes seeing dollars all over our code.
[11:51:46] <gnarf> like JavaScript ?
[11:51:51] <imsky> necromancer: write a bunch of wrappers that use even more dollars
[11:51:52] <imsky> win-win
[11:51:56] <necromancer> yup
[11:52:01] <necromancer> we'll be able to charge more per hour
[11:52:03] <ajpiano> mysphyt: <3
[11:52:09] <imsky> $._$($.print("hello world"))
[11:52:15] <gnarf> ?g all i do is win
[11:52:16] <mysphyt> gnarf, imsky: It's even worse when you use the "proper" ECMAScript.
[11:52:29] <imsky> mysphyt: proper HERP SCRIPT?
[11:52:32] <gnarf> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGXzlRoNtHU
[11:52:34] <wkmanire> ?ping
[11:52:37] <imsky> bot-t is dead
[11:52:39] <imsky> i know, tragedy
[11:53:08] <wkmanire> :(
[11:53:23] <imsky> but duke nukem forever is coming out soon
[11:53:42] <imsky> so all your worldly concerns are tiny by comparison
[11:53:57] <necromancer> hah
[11:54:14] <wkmanire> $('duke').nukem()
[11:54:40] <mysphyt> I was trying to explain to my wife why the release of Duke Nukem Forever meant that the world was almost certainly coming to an end, but she didn't get it.
[11:55:16] <imsky> yes
[11:57:59] <wkmanire> Man, my dryer is mislabled. It reads "very dry", "dry" and "energy preferred". "energy preferred" should have been written as "not dry".
[11:59:32] <ajpiano> at least it doens't cost you another $1.50 to run it again
[11:59:43] <ajpiano> or who knows, it might, but... not in quarters.
[11:59:43] <wkmanire> Thats a good point.
[11:59:51] <imsky> all it does is spin, spin, spin
[11:59:55] <imsky> and if you're going in...etc
[12:00:03] <ajpiano> the dryers at my builing suck, i just started sending my laundry out again
[12:00:07] <ajpiano> also it's way easier..
[12:00:24] <ajpiano> bbiab
[12:00:26] <imsky> apartment living lol
[12:00:40] <wkmanire> big city living.
[12:00:56] <wkmanire> ajpiano: How was that conference by the way? Learn anything good?
[12:02:38] <mysphyt> Topical question (crazy, right?): In $('td').height($('someselector').height) what selector can I use (or can I use this?) to get the parent tr of the td in question?
[12:03:00] <mysphyt> $('td') returns a set, so each will have a different parent tr.
[12:03:28] <wkmanire> this.parentNode I would imagine.
[12:03:49] <ajpiano> mysphyt, you'd have to do .each(function() { $(this).height($(this).parent().height) }) or something like that
[12:03:49] <wkmanire> $(this.parentNode) should be a tr.
[12:04:02] <ajpiano> wkmanire, it was good, jsconf is always quite a good deal of fun
[12:04:34] <wkmanire> Yeah, I told my boss about it. He said "Oh yeah? thats nice."
[12:04:46] <wkmanire> Then we went into a 2 week plan-ahead type conversation.
[12:04:47] <mysphyt> ajpiano: Ah.  Yes.  Derp.
[12:04:49] <wkmanire> :D
[12:05:02] <ajpiano> heh
[12:05:15] <ajpiano> jsconf is sold out super quick so you gotta know that you wanna go and be paying attention when it goes onsale anyway
[12:05:19] <senn_> when writing a cookie as a response to an ajax method, is it better to write it at the JS level or the server side level... im writing it at the server side level at the moment but it doesnt seem to be getting set
[12:06:28] <wkmanire> Maybe next year.
[12:07:30] <wkmanire> Is there a planned release for the grid yet? I'm gonna need to use it soon. In the next month or so.
[12:07:40] <imsky> the....grid?
[12:08:11] <wkmanire> imsky: http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/34246941/Grid#Stage1ZeroFeatureGridnbsp
[12:08:42] <imsky> this is why i don't use jquery-ui lol
[12:08:42] <wkmanire> If you want to play with it you can grab its branch off the jquery-ui github.
[12:08:50] <wkmanire> it*
[12:08:58] <wkmanire> imsky: Shame on you!
[12:09:05] <imsky> o_O
[12:09:17] <imsky> i use stuff like...draggable
[12:09:32] <oscar___> i got 2 UI sliders, how can i get value of both? (or either)
[12:10:20] <wkmanire> $( "#mySlider" ).option( "option", "value" );
[12:10:21] <wkmanire> on each one.
[12:10:29] <oscar___> option?
[12:10:32] <wkmanire> or you can get them both in the same selector and .each() or whatever you want.
[12:10:33] <wkmanire> sorry
[12:10:34] <wkmanire> not option
[12:10:35] <wkmanire> slider
[12:10:43] <wkmanire> $( "#mySlider" ).slider( "option", "value" );
[12:10:47] <oscar___> well i have to put the value of each into their own div
[12:11:42] <imsky> oh man, really selling me here, wkmanire
[12:11:43] <imsky> :P
[12:12:06] <oscar___> wkmanire: works, thanks
[12:12:11] <wkmanire> $( "#div1" ).text( $( "#mySlider" ).slider( "option", "value" ));
[12:12:15] <wkmanire> something like that.
[12:12:16] <wkmanire> welcome.
[12:12:19] <oscar___> :)
[12:14:57] * imsky is away: I'm busy
[12:15:00] <imanc> hey, is there a jquery module that'll render a form label inside an input box, e.g.  [search … ]
[12:15:56] <wkmanire> You want <input><label /></input> ?
[12:16:19] <sokie_de> there is no such thing
[12:17:43] <wkmanire> time to work.
[12:18:10] <imanc> no..
[12:18:12] <jovrtn> you can do it with pure css3 nowadays, but typically you can absolutely position the label over the top of an input
[12:18:21] <imanc> just to put some text inside an input box, so I dont have to have a label
[12:18:27] <jovrtn> then capture click events on the label and trigger focus on the underlying input
[12:18:46] <imanc> OK - i was just wondering if something existed in jquery to do this quickly
[12:18:59] <sokie_de> it does.
[12:19:12] <jovrtn> this is a pretty standard approach: http://www.zurb.com/playground/inline-form-labels
[12:19:28] <imanc> I have to do it for a hoooge form
[12:19:44] <imanc> excdllent - jovrtn thanks!
[12:19:44] <jovrtn> hooge form is hooge
[12:19:48] <jovrtn> sure thing
[12:20:11] <imanc> ahh css3 .. hmm
[12:20:30] <imanc> I'm sure this needs to at least function in IE6
[12:21:01] <jovrtn> if you don't actually need to use a <label> tag, you can use JS to manipulate the input element's value
[12:21:23] <jovrtn> in lieu of a real label
[12:30:26] <stan_man_can> I'm trying to use the datepicker and it's working, but when I pass it any options they're not being applied? http://pastebin.com/9MAgddd2
[12:31:22] <paperboy> hi. Sometimes my page gets stuck and i see the error "too much recursion" is any one familiar with that and what can i do to fix it?
[12:31:28] <v0lZy> hello
[12:31:39] <v0lZy> Question
[12:31:42] <v0lZy> for DHTML stuff...
[12:31:51] <v0lZy> How do i tame the back button
[12:32:33] <vubuntor516> Helo
[12:32:58] <stan_man_can> paperboy: there's plenty available if you google that eror. Not to mention you've provided no code for people to look at even if we could help your issue
[12:33:16] <stan_man_can> v0IZy: that's nowhere near enough detail. what does "tame" mean?
[12:35:58] <Abjorn> ahh some food and water cured that hangover up
[12:36:42] <jovrtn> stan_man_can: what options aren't being applied?
[12:36:52] <stan_man_can> jovrtn: neither are working
[12:37:24] <jovrtn> defaultDate is null, which seems to be working
[12:37:55] <stan_man_can> defaultDate is supposed to set it to the current date
[12:37:58] <stan_man_can> it's just leaving it blank for me
[12:38:07] <jovrtn> and you have no altField for altFormat to display on
[12:38:13] <stan_man_can> the box functions as a datepicker but it loads blank and the date format is still wrong
[12:38:48] <jovrtn> ahh
[12:38:50] <jovrtn> sec
[12:39:34] <stan_man_can> jovrtn: omg dateFormat not altFormat -- sorry :(
[12:39:44] <stan_man_can> defaultDate's still not working though
[12:39:53] <jovrtn> yeah taking a peek
[12:43:02] <jovrtn> stan_man_can: defaultDate works, you just can't see it highlighted because you have no theme applied
[12:43:20] <jovrtn> link this guy for testing
[12:43:22] <jovrtn> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1/themes/ui-lightness/jquery-ui.css
[12:44:38] <stan_man_can> http://screencast.com/t/DBOZIHXh1r1a
[12:45:28] <jovrtn> alles gut?
[12:45:51] <stan_man_can> pardon?
[12:45:56] <jovrtn> 'everything good?'
[12:46:00] <stan_man_can> no :(
[12:46:04] <stan_man_can> still no default date
[12:46:16] <jovrtn> what defaultDate does
[12:46:20] <stan_man_can> or maybe i'm expecting it to work differently
[12:46:22] <jovrtn> is sets the current highlighted date on the datepicker
[12:46:26] <jovrtn> it doesn't set anything in the input
[12:46:29] <stan_man_can> ah, gotcha
[12:46:36] <stan_man_can> i'll do that in PHP
[12:46:36] <jovrtn> you have to echo out a current date variable into the input value or somesuch
[12:46:39] <jovrtn> word
[12:46:41] <stan_man_can> yeah thanks :)
[12:46:44] <jovrtn> np!
[12:46:45] <stan_man_can> sorry for the confusion
[12:47:17] <jovrtn> no worries
[12:49:45] <senn_> does httponly cookies mean cookies are only et on a full http request
[12:49:54] <senn_> can they not be set via javascript
[12:50:34] <senn_> i have an ajax function which wont set a cookie and its driving me insane
[12:50:56] <senn_> part of the $.ajax(); success function, I set a cookie but it isnt getting set...
[12:51:35] <sean`> senn_, javascript can set cookies
[12:52:31] <senn_> yeah i just set them outside this method and it worked fine
[12:52:42] <senn_> im guessing something is wrong, so frustrating
[12:55:33] <Ismogoan> anyone knows why the datepicker plugin puts this in the input field: 14/05/20112011
[12:55:57] <Ismogoan> it puts everyhting correct except for the year, which it duplicates for some odd reason
[12:56:42] <imanc> does anyone know how to set the xhr header on a $().load request?  I basically need the server to be able to detect it as a jquery load over accessing the page directly
[12:57:30] <stan_man_can> Ismogoan: are you using dateFormat ?
[12:57:36] <Ismogoan> yes!
[12:57:45] <stan_man_can> "dd-mm-yy" not "dd-mm-yyyy"
[12:57:49] <Ismogoan> i'm trying to create a jsfiddle
[12:57:56] <Ismogoan> will try
[12:58:18] <stan_man_can> http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Datepicker/formatDate
[12:59:09] <Ismogoan> no i think you misunderstand me
[12:59:12] <Ismogoan> then I get 14/05/11
[12:59:24] <stan_man_can> have you tried it?
[12:59:34] <Ismogoan> wow
[12:59:37] <Ismogoan> this is so weird
[12:59:40] <Ismogoan> i tried it
[12:59:45] <Ismogoan> and still get my year two times :o
[12:59:50] <stan_man_can> y = two digit year
[12:59:52] <stan_man_can> yy = four digit year
[12:59:56] <Ismogoan> eg: 18/05/20112011
[12:59:59] <stan_man_can> so yyyy is 20112011
[13:00:14] <stan_man_can> jsfiddle it then
[13:00:27] <Ismogoan> sec
[13:00:39] <Ismogoan> ow darn
[13:00:42] <Ismogoan> you were right
[13:00:49] <Ismogoan> yy instead of yyyy did it
[13:00:50] <Ismogoan> thank you!
[13:00:54] <stan_man_can> lol
[13:00:55] <stan_man_can> no worries
[13:17:06] <mysphyt> Odd question: Is there an easy way to get the height of the tallest element in a set?
[13:17:34] <mysphyt> I.e., $('div').height() will return the height of the first div; but I'm wanting the height only of the tallest div.
[13:18:13] <ajpiano> Math.max.apply(null, $("div").map(function() { return $(this).height(); }).get());
[13:19:12] <mysphyt> ajpiano: Perfect, thanks.
[13:20:19] <mysphyt> ajpiano: HA!  That worked perfectly, and solved an incredibly minor problem that has been driving me OUT OF MY GOURD.  Thanks.
[13:20:44] <sean`> gourds are hot
[13:20:49] <ajpiano> excellent, i hope you cna be reengoudulated
[13:21:48] <asti> Hulloh, not sure how to formulate the question but, umm i'm trying to find the documentation for $("<tagname />", propertiesofthetag)-functionality on docs.jquery.com not sure where to look, tried selectors.

[13:22:57] <no5thdimension> if I have a series of li and I wish to fade between each one in a loop, how do i go about doing that?
[13:23:00] <adnasa> anybody would recommend a good intermediate tutorial screencast / blog out there? I feel that the jQuery documentation can be overwhelming at times.
[13:23:20] <ajpiano> no5thdimension http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/
[13:23:44] <asti> ajpiano: thanx alot.

[13:24:08] <no5thdimension> ajpiano: thanks, ill look into it
[13:24:09] <adnasa> ajpiano no :-)
[13:24:47] <adnasa> looks very promising.. bookmark*

[13:27:11] <QaDeS> getting the action attribute of a form using my_form.attr("action") doesn't work on my box. am i doing it wrong, or could that be a bug?
[13:27:34] <adnasa> amazing.. thanks alot guys. now let's see if I come back as a master say..... tomorrow? :-P
[13:39:38] <mysphyt> Is it kosher to include a script at the end of a page with $('.class').ready(do_something);?
[13:40:00] <mysphyt> So then if an ajax request loads something of that class, the command gets run?
[13:40:05] <mysphyt> Or am I thinking about this backwards?
[13:40:13] <ajpiano> no it doesn't work that way
[13:40:21] <ajpiano> you can do livequery do do that type of thing
[13:40:26] <ajpiano> but you are more or less thinking about it backwards
[13:41:25] <ajpiano> what you really want is to initialize components and those components do event delegation on the highest level container in the component
[13:41:27] <mysphyt> ajpiano: Good to know.
[13:41:48] <ajpiano> so there's a minimum of binding... and rebinding... going on
[13:41:55] <mysphyt> ajpiano: Can you explain that, like, for a stupid person?
[13:41:57] <w-zone> i will pay(paypal) to person who will add slider to my site. site uses CI and smarty templates.  any one interested?
[13:42:02] * mysphyt <---------
[13:42:30] <ajpiano> mysphyt: so like, say you have a comment box thing
[13:43:08] <ajpiano> you're saying that if you had $(".comment_box").ready(function() { }) you could initialize it whenever a new commentBox shows up for some reason
[13:43:37] <ajpiano> instead the idea would be to say like, on the click that is supposed to do the ajax call or whatever that fetches a new comment box
[13:43:55] <ajpiano> you have a constructor that creates commentboxes
[13:44:05] <ajpiano> so you're like hey app, new CommentBox() please
[13:44:13] <ajpiano> and then it makes some markup, probably from a template
[13:44:35] <ajpiano> and to the top level element of that thing, you delegate all the events that have to happen to things inside of it
[13:45:21] <mysphyt> Okay.
[13:45:22] <mysphyt> I think.
[13:45:44] <ajpiano> incidentally, that is how backbone.js works
[13:45:44] <ajpiano> .
[13:46:16] <ajpiano> ;)
[13:46:59] <ajpiano> it's also how pretty much any object oriented thing around working with the dom would work, including other frameworks, or just rolling it yourself..
[13:47:06] <mysphyt> I'm converting an old PHP app to jQuery/AJAX, so all the element generation is done procedurally by PHP.
[13:48:21] <mysphyt> It's this whole big purely procedural mess on the PHP side, which works fine but is not pretty.  I was hoping to give it a facelift, but not a complete rewrite, but I'm detecting that that may be not so much possible.
[13:48:36] <ajpiano> it's not hard to make php output markup that you can use for templates on the client side, should you need to
[13:49:00] <mysphyt> Sure.
[13:49:40] <ajpiano> you could still implement the same thing conceptually without involving templates or anyting like that though
[13:49:46] <mysphyt> What I'm doing now is taking the output of the PHP scripts, which can vary hugely, and plopping them into a div, which more or less replicates the functionality of the old system.
[13:50:55] <ajpiano> that'll work
[13:51:33] <mysphyt> So right now the JS doesn't have to be aware of the contents/structure of what gets brought in through AJAX.  But in a few cases, I'm wanting the JS to manipulate the contents of that div once it gets loaded.
[13:51:39] <ajpiano> the basic idea is like, instead of trying to detect when stuff happens in the dom and then make your app happen, have your app make things happen in the dom, and then delegate events
[13:51:57] <mysphyt> I was hoping I could just adjust those individual scripts to say, "Okay, once I get loaded, do these things."
[13:52:08] <ajpiano> yeah i mean... that is possilbe
[13:52:10] <ajpiano> if they're ALL ajax
[13:52:17] <ajpiano> then you can look for elements in the response
[13:52:34] <mysphyt> But I should still be doing all of this in the root js, not in the individual PHP scripts.
[13:52:51] <ajpiano> :/
[13:52:54] <mysphyt> Right?
[13:53:17] <ajpiano> probably neither
[13:53:27] <necromancer> be careful though, if it's all ajax it won't get indexed by google
[13:53:30] <mysphyt> Where should I be doing it?
[13:53:42] <necromancer> unless that doesn't matter
[13:53:44] <mysphyt> Yeah, I don't care about google.  I'd rather google not know about me.  :P
[13:53:48] <necromancer> haha ok
[13:54:02] <ajpiano> somewhere in the js, perhaps in the root.js file but not just glomped in there
[13:54:10] <mysphyt> This is a very small app for my department.
[13:54:21] <mysphyt> Not something public-facing.
[13:54:24] <ajpiano> all the ajax calls are like, being run through the same ajax call kind of thing?
[13:54:55] <ajpiano> beng "ajaxified" or something along those lines?
[13:56:17] <mysphyt> ajpiano: I have a menu full of anchors.  In the header of the index.html, I have something like $(document).ready(function () { $('a').click(function() { loadContent($(this).attr('href'));}); .
[13:56:49] <ajpiano> can you paste loadContent itself somewhere
[13:57:30] <mysphyt> ajpiano: And then I have a loadContent(action) function in my root js that fetches action.php and as a callback runs $('#content').html(data) (if data is html) .
[13:57:38] <ajpiano> right
[13:57:43] <ajpiano> so you need to add some logic in that callback
[13:58:00] <ajpiano> where you could like, check to see the classname of the top level thing you brought in
[13:58:08] <ajpiano> and if it corresponds to say, some object of widgets that you have
[13:58:18] <ajpiano> run the corresponding initialization code
[13:58:26] <ajpiano> so like the callback would be
[14:00:00] <mysphyt> if ($(#content .desiredClass)) { $(#content .desiredClass).doWhatever(); }
[14:00:15] <ajpiano> var thing = $(data);  thing.appendTo(container);  if ( widgets[ thing.data("widgetType") ] {  widgets[thing.data("widgetType")].init(thing)  }
[14:00:55] <ajpiano> if you use some sort of corresponding nomenclature between the names of the js functions and attributes on the incoming data
[14:01:22] <mysphyt> Gotcha.
[14:01:24] <ajpiano> you will find you'll have to write less code and it will be more flexible
[14:01:41] <ajpiano> mysphyt, it truly is a pleasure to be able to say actual words and have it improve the situation
[14:01:49] <mysphyt> ajpiano: Yah.  The question is not how much code I have to write, though, but how much I have to rewrite.  :P
[14:01:53] <ajpiano> heh
[14:02:35] <ajpiano> that way should help you keep the separate conditions separate and deal with deleaating off to them from the main callback tirvial
[14:02:40] <adnasa> just realized that i can't live without .bind()
[14:02:45] <ajpiano> delegating*
[14:03:07] <mysphyt> Cool.
[14:03:38] <mysphyt> Lately I spend way more time in IRC figuring out how to work than actually working.
[14:04:16] <ajpiano> you're pre-experienced!
[14:04:54] <mysphyt> Heh.
[14:05:05] <mysphyt> Arright.  I have to get out of here for a while and try to, y'know, do something.
[14:05:19] <ajpiano> godluck
[14:06:07] <mysphyt> Thanks.  And thanks for all the help/basic education.  :P
[14:06:32] <mysphyt> (Sometimes I wish there were a freenode channel called #stuffyoudontevenknowyouneedtoknow.)
[14:06:50] <QaDeS> how do i access the action attribute of a form?
[14:07:29] <mysphyt> $(form).attr('action'), I think.
[14:07:56] <mysphyt> Sorry, that was for QaDeS.
[14:08:08] <mysphyt> QaDeS: http://api.jquery.com/attr/
[14:09:30] <QaDeS> well, yea. just noticed i have an error somewhere else. how do i select the parent form of an element inside it? $(this).parents("form").first() doesn't give me anything
[14:10:10] <QaDeS> i was selecting for a class, and didn't notice i has another matching element there. without an action attr ;)
[14:12:21] <w-zone> i will pay(paypal) to person who will add jquery slider to my site.  pm me if interested.
[14:23:15] <imanc> does anyone know how to force an xhr header in a jquery.load() request?  I don't seem to be detcting the xhr header server side
[14:27:48] <unomi> How can I test if there *are* elements with a certain class on a page?
[14:27:59] <sean`> ?length @ unomi
[14:28:03] <unomi> I don't want to collect or traverse them
[14:28:13] <sean`> you need to find them first
[14:28:37] <unomi> is there a way to tell jquery to just get the first it finds?
[14:28:55] <sean`> unomi, .first () or :first as a selector
[14:30:01] <unomi> thanks sean`
[14:40:52] <rethus> <a href="#" onclick=\"sendCmd("command","Command='konference show stats'");\">Do something</a>
[14:41:03] <rethus> i always get unexpected token on this line
[14:41:10] <rethus> seems to be the = into the string
[14:41:22] <rethus> how can i fix this?
[14:43:30] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/
[14:44:20] <rethus> http://jsfiddle.net/kRASw/
[14:44:21] <imanc> how come you're escaping the " in the onclick ? nclick=\"sendCm
[14:44:49] <rethus> cause i use bot " and ' inside of the function
[14:45:49] <imanc> wow, didn't know you could escape the outer quotes
[14:51:02] <sean`> omg rethus1 that's so dirty
[14:51:06] <sean`> imanc, don't do that plz
[14:51:13] <rethus1> http://jsfiddle.net/kRASw/2/
[14:51:35] <sean`> use data attributes to provide context
[14:51:43] <sean`> and bind using js
[14:51:57] <imanc> sean`: yeh, i woudln;t
[14:52:15] <imanc> rethus1: probably want to change that statement so you're escaping double quotes inside your onclick=""
[14:53:22] <sean`> http://jsfiddle.net/kRASw/3/
[14:54:02] <sean`> plus the redundancy of having sendCmd and a textual value of 'command' make no sense
[14:57:04] <rethus1> but i need exactly this as second param:
[14:57:15] <rethus1> konference="start konference"
[14:57:21] <rethus1> with = and "
[14:57:36] <rethus1> cause it will be parsed to a telephone-server-cli
[14:57:57] <rethus1> ther must be created such a tag:
[14:58:29] <rethus1> <command command="konference list" />
[14:59:56] <rethus1> you know what i mean sean`
[15:02:11] <flayks> hi there
[15:02:32] <flayks> i have a problem with an ajax link in this page http://flayks.com/realisations
[15:03:17] <flayks> when i click to the home link in the menu (Accueil) or the logo, it makes a # anchor but no ajax loading
[15:03:21] <flayks> do you have an idea ?
[15:04:57] <tmayr> flayks: it loads here perfectly
[15:05:09] <flayks> tmayr: you have the homepage ?
[15:05:21] <mello> hi, how can i set the value of any input type in jquery mobile with plain html?
[15:05:23] <tmayr> i can navigate, every ajax req is being fired without major issues
[15:05:34] <mello> If i set  the value attribute in m html it is removed
[15:06:02] <flayks> tmayr: yep but if you click in the logo from a direct url without anchors, it works ?
[15:06:28] <flayks> in my case i have no ajax req in console (fx4)
[15:06:45] <tmayr> yeah
[15:06:58] <tmayr> logo works just fine
[15:07:33] <tmayr> ohh i see what you mean now
[15:08:10] <tmayr> yeah it isnt working from any direct url
[15:08:19] <flayks> yep thats it :/
[15:12:43] <flayks> tmayr: an idea ?
[15:12:58] <tmayr> flayks you'll have to take a look at how you're parsing your urls, sometimes when going back and forth i end up with http://flayks.com/realisations#realisations/la-folie-douce-val-thorens-site-mobile
[15:13:01] <tmayr> other than that, not really sure
[15:13:27] <tmayr> i havent worked with hashs before :P
[15:14:53] <tonnez> how do i match any element with class .foo and has an attribute named "title"
[15:15:33] <ion-> $('.foo').filter(function(){return this.attr(
[15:15:38] <ion-> oops
[15:15:53] <ion-> $('.foo').filter(function(){return this.attr('title') != undefined})
[15:15:55] <ion-> try something like that
[15:16:00] <ajpiano> $(".foo[title]")
[15:16:14] <tonnez> ajpiano, i was actually just going to ask if that would work, thank you!
[15:16:19] <ion-> or that :)
[15:16:38] <mello> i'm a jquery noob btw, but how could I do a ajax request for data at the beginning of a pageload only when a selector matches something?
[15:17:02] <ajpiano> if ($("#foo").length) {  doAnAjaxRequest(;  }
[15:18:05] <mello> why check on length, would it also work without it?
[15:18:20] <ajpiano> no
[15:18:21] <ajpiano> it won't
[15:18:30] <ajpiano> otherwise it'sa n empty jquery object which is truthy
[15:19:43] <mello> ok, thanks
[15:25:43] <noregret> any idea of a plugin that shows the original pic size when hovering over the thumbnail ?
[15:32:55] <imanc> question - I have a block of html code that is loaded into a div with $().load() - would it be acceptable to have <script src=""> in the block of code that is loaded?
[15:33:41] <trend> no :P
[15:34:09] <trend> you shouldn't, but I guess you can if you must
[15:34:46] <trend> is the js dynamic? why not $.get(url,function(){ alert('succes'); }); ?
[15:38:48] <imanc> trend: yeh, I guess it's a bad idea. I put the include in the main file.  This whole job feels hacky.
[15:39:01] <trend> heh
[15:42:27] <noregret> any idea of a plugin that shows the original pic size when hovering over the thumbnail ?

[15:46:16] <Charuru> anyone know what's going on here
[15:49:55] <ngharo> Charuru: I would imagine it needs to else how would it trigger and on mousemove handlers a user may have registered
[15:51:02] <Charuru> ngharo: 1.2 doesn't do this
[15:51:06] <Charuru> does 1.2 not work with mousemove
[15:51:17] <ngharo> i dont know.  1.2 is ancient
[15:51:32] <ngharo> events will fire all the time
[15:51:36] <ngharo> resize window - event fired
[15:51:42] <ngharo> load image - event fired
[15:51:54] <Charuru> yeah mousemove is totally different though

[15:57:35] <imanc> I have a button click handler $().click() and I want to add another click handler which gets called first. How can I do this?
[15:59:12] <Karai> I am having a very bizarre issue with JSON. When I try to parse a string I just set, I get an UNEXPECTED TOKEN ILLEGAL error, but if I parse the string I just set in the same function I set it in it works FINE. What could possibly be causing this? http://pastie.org/1901682
[16:00:22] <primepie> is there an "official" jquery upload plugin?
[16:09:20] <primepie> anyone here?
[16:09:28] <coldhead> sure kid
[16:09:28] <jrockjiggz> yo
[16:14:06] <Kre10s> When I have a popup, I know I can use window.opener to get at the window that created the popup. How can I trigger code to execute in that window?
[16:21:49] <coldhead> Kre10s: can you write a script tag into the popup with http://www.quirksmode.org/js/popup.html#writing
[16:25:26] <Kre10s> coldhead, thats simple :P I need to have the already existing script trigger an event in the calling window.
[16:27:31] <Kre10s> say in the main window I have a script containing function foo... I want the popup window to run foo as if it were running in the main window.
[16:28:39] <coldhead> i believe there's a parent reference?
[16:28:46] <coldhead> it's only my first day using javascript but i read that somewhere
[16:30:10] <coldhead> oh i don;t think you can run functions from the child window in the parent
[16:30:11] <coldhead> that seems like a securty risk
[16:30:45] <shesek> if its the same schema/domain/port, you cana
[16:31:00] <coldhead> talk us through it, shesek!
[16:31:09] <murph> is there something like jquery.autocomplete.js that does a freetext search, not just autocompleting only on the start of the string
[16:31:12] * coldhead gets popcorn
[16:33:27] <Gelegrodan> murph: hack it! its a good base ;)
[16:34:04] <murph> of course :) just making sure i wasn't writing something that had already been done well
[16:34:29] <Gelegrodan> should be some out there ^^
[16:34:50] <Gelegrodan> imo should be an option for jq ui autocomplete
[16:36:00] <coldhead> shesek: Kre10s: i can call window.opener.foo() from the child but it runs in the parent
[16:36:05] <coldhead> i have no idea
[16:36:16] <murph> i guess the jq ui one has a 'callback' function where i can just write that bit of the code. i'll do that.
[16:36:31] <Gelegrodan> murph: seems like it already works in jquery ui's version?
[16:36:45] <Gelegrodan> murph: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/
[16:37:25] <RobW> ok wtf
[16:37:32] <friskd> is there some jquery function that would allow me to pass a json object w/ style in it.
[16:37:34] <RobW> $("table tr").each() iterates over every TD
[16:37:41] <RobW> how do I iterate over every TR.. $("table") is wrong
[16:37:52] <friskd> rather than have to call css(property, propertyValue)
[16:37:55] <friskd> for each..
[16:38:36] <coldhead> 'table tr' should iterate over trs
[16:38:49] <coldhead> RobW: can you paste a demo up on jsfiddle?
[16:39:17] <RobW> yeah one sec
[16:39:31] <tmayr> 'table tr' does iterate over every tr, at least it did when i used it a few months ago .p
[16:39:32] <tmayr> :P
[16:39:58] <necromancer> murph: did you try jquery.tokenInput?
[16:40:24] <coldhead> friskd: i haven't seen a plugin to do that, the trouble is that the styles can be declared in so many places
[16:40:51] <coldhead> including user stylesheets :\
[16:40:55] <friskd> coldhead: http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/docs/tutorials/#styling
[16:41:05] <friskd> see how this guy has you pass in in a style...
[16:41:27] <Gelegrodan> friskd: take a look at the source then?
[16:41:29] <friskd> seems like there should be a standard way for people to pass in a style like that via javascript... and it just apply the styles...
[16:41:46] <friskd> yea... Gelegrodan  getting into it... figured id ask before i spend another 10 minutes looking for it
[16:41:47] <coldhead> friskd: that's not a good practice
[16:41:54] <RobW> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/JZmTn/
[16:42:04] <coldhead> you want to avoid putting style in your JS
[16:42:12] <coldhead> it belongs in your css
[16:42:23] <coldhead> qtip is strange
[16:42:36] <RobW> coldhead: it has 15 alert boxes
[16:42:56] <RobW> not sure where the hell it's getting 15 from..
[16:43:22] <friskd> ok.
[16:43:24] <friskd> good to know.
[16:43:30] <friskd> i suppose i can always just addClass
[16:43:39] <murph> necromancer, oh jquery.tokenInput looks like it'll do the job beautifully
[16:43:41] <murph> thx
[16:43:46] <Gelegrodan> RobW: there is 15 tr's
[16:44:03] <friskd> its just sometimes i want my tooltip widths to be different sizes... and i didn't want to have to write a clas for each... but i suppose that is best..
[16:44:09] <RobW> oh HAHA
[16:44:13] <RobW> i forgot i have spacer TR's
[16:44:18] <RobW> fml
[16:44:32] <coldhead> lol
[16:44:39] <Gelegrodan> haha
[16:44:42] <Gelegrodan> great work there :D
[16:44:49] <Gelegrodan> use console.log(v);
[16:44:54] <coldhead> addClass is definitely a neater way to do it, friskd
[16:45:01] <RobW> table tr[class!=sep] ftw
[16:45:03] <Gelegrodan> and you can see which it finds
[16:45:11] <coldhead> you can change the width on a per element asis
[16:45:14] <coldhead> basis*
[16:45:15] <RobW> Gelegrodan: thanks
[16:45:24] <coldhead> but the less customisation in your JS the better
[16:45:33] <Gelegrodan> RobW: and check in firebug ofc ^^
[16:45:33] <coldhead> thanks for pasting, RobW :)
[16:45:40] <coldhead> saved everyone a bunch of time
[16:46:36] <Gelegrodan> pro tip I would like to share from today... Check the features of a program before hacking in support for it !
[16:46:46] <RobW> console.log does nothing
[16:46:53] <Gelegrodan> RobW: you have firebug?
[16:46:56] <RobW> yes
[16:47:05] <Gelegrodan> check "console" of it
[16:47:14] <RobW> nevermind i'm an idiot
[16:47:58] <Gelegrodan> works?
[16:48:13] <Gelegrodan> console.log(v) instead of the alert
[16:48:36] <RobW> yes
[16:48:44] <RobW> i haven't been having a good day today :/
[16:49:06] <RobW> so in the .each(function(i, v) { }) why can't i use the object V?
[16:49:11] <RobW> or am I doing this wrong, such as $(v).<blah>
[16:49:36] <RobW> because I figured jquery would handle the object..
[16:49:40] <Kre10s> .each might not be attached to any lists...
[16:49:53] <RobW> Kre10s: it's iterating over table rows for a form
[16:50:14] <Kre10s> empty.each(function(i,v){ never runs });
[16:50:33] <RobW> right but i mean within the function, see: http://jsfiddle.net/JZmTn/1/
[16:50:48] <RobW> wrong one, http://jsfiddle.net/JZmTn/2/
[16:51:25] <RobW> see what i'm trying to do here?
[16:51:36] <RobW> if anything per row is filled in, then its adjacent fields have to be filled out as well
[16:51:44] <Kre10s> v.find... that looks bad. try $(v).find
[16:51:56] <RobW> tried that as well, along with $(this)
[16:53:14] <Kre10s> also. one time you use val().length and another val().length() ...
[16:53:35] <RobW> oh
[16:53:40] <RobW> it's $("td", object)
[16:53:47] <RobW> $("td", v).<stuff>
[16:54:05] <RobW> that's weird.. wouldn't that be the same as $(v).find("td").<stuff> ?
[16:55:43] <wafflesburger> question: why would you not use doT or doU templating
[17:02:14] <coldhead> what are those things
[17:07:32] <RobW> coldhead: figured it out: http://jsfiddle.net/JZmTn/7/
[17:12:50] <RobW> whoa.. return false is no longer effective against stopping form submission
[17:13:07] <RobW> nvm
[17:14:54] <coldhead> RobW: i would prefer tr:not(.sep) under the possibly mistaken belief it is faster and more readable
[17:15:34] <coldhead> i also suspect the code could be a lot shorterr and replaced with the validation plugin but if it works then  carry on and good luck
[17:20:51] <L4suicide> is there a simple way of finding out what is being sent in a post/get request before it is sent to the server?

[17:40:35] <Whirl3d> Good evening all.
[17:40:45] <knapper_tech> i have two iframe's that have elements with identical id's
[17:41:24] <L4suicide> hey Whirl3d :) I have my script highlighting like magic ;-) Blackjack has never been so easy..
[17:41:25] <knapper_tech> running $('#myid') selects the first element in the dom
[17:41:27] <amh345> is this the proper way to define z-index?   $('#m_window').css(z-index: "200") ?
[17:41:43] <knapper_tech> i'd like to specify either the visible one or grab one of the two based on div id etc
[17:41:54] <knapper_tech> is it possible to nest a selection like that?
[17:43:21] <L4suicide> what is a jqHXR object?
[17:43:47] <amh345> oh. .css(zIndex,200);
[17:44:00] <amh345> i think .css took normal css attributes
[17:44:02] <amh345> though*
[17:44:04] <amh345> t
[17:44:12] <nixninja> I have a noob question I want to toggle the fadein fadeout of a div with the class of menu-box when the mouse is over a div with the class of header-box how do I do this I tried binding mouseover to header-box but the menu-box bounces in and out it does stay in one state
[17:44:45] <knapper_tech> if two elements in the document have the same id, will any combination of selectors allow me to specify which one i want?
[17:44:53] <knapper_tech> they are in different div's
[17:45:40] <knapper_tech> actually...i guess i can just unload the forms whenever they're hidden
[17:45:53] <knapper_tech> then there is only one id that can exist at a time
[17:46:08] <Whirl3d> ?jqHXR
[17:46:39] <Whirl3d> omg, bot-t is ignorning me..
[17:49:00] <L4suicide> heh, did you upset it?
[17:49:05] <L4suicide> ?jqHXR
[17:49:22] <L4suicide> @L4suicide ?jqHXR
[18:06:40] <ionico> hi
[18:07:00] <ionico> hi gnarf
[18:07:01] <dabear> hola
[18:14:19] <L4suicide> can i use the ajax pre-filter if im not sending ajax requests?
[18:18:05] <L4suicide> im having trouble trying to use $.get and $.post to perform some actions for me (using greasemonkey) as the site (not mine) doesnt like it. I think there is other data the server side checks which i'm not sending in my requests
[18:37:55] <Taggnostr> hello
[18:41:11] <Taggnostr> I did something like var x = $('some html'); x.prependTo('.someclass') to add x to all the elements with someclass, but when I switched to $('.someclass').each(function(index) { x.prependTo($(this)) }) only the last one was getting 'x' and I had to create x inside the each
[18:41:22] <Taggnostr> why is this necessary? and is there a way to avoid it?
[18:52:57] <amh345> is $(document).width();  the proper way to get the usable area in the browser window?
[18:53:05] <amh345> well, width
[19:36:11] <Taggnostr> I have a container with a few elements and text nodes and I want to start toggling all the elements when I find an element with a class .foo, and stop when I find .bar, I'm trying with a for loop over contents() and a boolean flag to decide when I'm toggling and when not, but the for loop doesn't seem to work too well with contents()
[19:37:48] <Taggnostr> with each() I don't know how to use the control variable, currently I'm doing something like "var hide = false; if (elem.hasClass('.foo')) hide = true; if (elem.hasClass('.bar')) hide = false; if (hide == true) elem.toggle()"
[19:38:06] <letterpress> what are you searching for? and can you apply a class to this beforehand?
[19:40:05] <sasori> question: anyone who has a simple script that only allows 0-9 digits in input box plus decimal point ?
[19:40:53] <Taggnostr> letterpress, I have no control over the html
[19:41:14] <letterpress> what are you looking for though, that will determine whether to toggle or not?
[19:41:42] <Taggnostr> all the elements between .foo (included) and .bar (excluded) should be toggled
[19:41:51] <Taggnostr> this happens when I click on a button
[19:42:34] <Taggnostr> and the container might have more .foo and .bar alternated
[19:43:07] <Whirl3d> are you allowed to animate scrollTop?
[19:43:08] <letterpress> can you throw up some code quickly at jsfiddle.net?
[19:43:22] <Taggnostr> let me try
[19:44:24] <Whirl3d> nvm, lol
[19:48:42] <Taggnostr> letterpress: http://jsfiddle.net/yDC5A/1/
[19:50:31] <letterpress> in real life, are all your nodes in spans without children?
[19:50:55] <Taggnostr> I think so, let me check
[19:51:06] <Taggnostr> http://jsfiddle.net/yDC5A/2/ <- this is an updated version that shows the parts that should be toggled
[19:51:50] <Taggnostr> there should be only spans with a number of different classes and text nodes
[19:52:10] <letterpress> but you always toggle foo, you never do anything to bar
[19:52:40] <Taggnostr> yes, but also all the nodes between foo and bar should be toggled
[19:52:53] <letterpress> ahhh that's what i didn't understand
[19:53:27] <jigz> ? (?>?<)??????:?;?+???????? (?>?<)??????:?;?+???????
[19:54:27] <Taggnostr> letterpress, the algorithm should be fine, I think the problem is in the for loop
[19:55:57] <Taggnostr> (and there's a missing ')' at the end of the jquery code)
[19:57:13] <L4suicide> gnarf: How would I use ajaxprefilter to see what data i sending in requests? It doesn't seem call that function when i submit a page..
[19:58:08] <Whirl3d> on the change event for an input field, the value of the field should change if the change event is fired, right? I keep getting the same value for the input field even after changing it.
[19:58:10] <Taggnostr> letterpress, I'm getting somewhere: http://jsfiddle.net/yDC5A/7/
[19:58:33] <Taggnostr> this seems to work, but it stops immediately after the first toggle
[19:59:05] <Taggnostr> uhm, maybe it's because the textnodes don't have an .hasClass
[19:59:09] <letterpress> whoa try console.log(elem) instead of alert
[20:00:01] <Whirl3d> Taggnostr, what are you trying to accomplish?
[20:00:32] <Taggnostr> Whirl3d, toggle all the nodes between .foo included and .bar excluded
[20:00:41] <Whirl3d> L4suicide, I haven't seen gnarf on in a while...
[20:01:03] <Whirl3d> toggle their visibility?
[20:01:18] <Taggnostr> if I find a way to recognize text nodes I can check for that and everything should work
[20:01:25] <Taggnostr> Whirl3d, yes, using .toggle()
[20:01:56] <Taggnostr> can I even toggle a text node?
[20:02:19] <Taggnostr> or should I wrap it in a span or something?
[20:02:25] <letterpress> yeah i was just going to say that
[20:02:38] <letterpress> put the text node into something you can hide
[20:02:58] <Taggnostr> and how can I recognize the text nodes while looping?
[20:03:07] <Whirl3d> you can hide a span, I am pretty sure
[20:03:23] <letterpress> well can't you give them a class "text" or something?
[20:03:53] <letterpress> oh you mean wrap them within this function?
[20:03:58] <Taggnostr> yep
[20:04:19] <orolo> how do i get the jsonp feature working w/ jsfiddle.net and jQuery? i have a fiddle started and could use some help: http://jsfiddle.net/orolo/DBE5n/
[20:04:25] <Whirl3d> Taggnostr, I am afraid that you are missing the point of jquery. Jquery does the work for you. You are manually cycling through your jquery returned array when you could easily just use .each
[20:04:46] <Taggnostr> Whirl3d, with .each() I can't use the control variable easily
[20:04:55] <letterpress> https://developer.mozilla.org/en/nodeType
[20:04:55] <Whirl3d> ?
[20:05:07] <letterpress> elem.nodeType == 3
[20:05:14] <Taggnostr> Whirl3d, see http://jsfiddle.net/yDC5A/8/
[20:05:19] <Taggnostr> letterpress, thanks
[20:05:38] <gavin_huang> Is it possible to get the width of an inline element whose parent is hidden? here is an example http://jsfiddle.net/YMHdL/
[20:05:44] <Taggnostr> I was looking at nextUnitl but it ignores text nodes
[20:07:04] <letterpress> gavin_huang not to my knowledge
[20:07:49] <letterpress> unless you can use visibility: hidden
[20:07:50] <RobW> gavin_huang: yes: http://jsfiddle.net/YMHdL/1/
[20:08:12] <RobW> oh inline
[20:08:39] <RobW> should still read if it has a width set first
[20:09:26] <amh345> evening everyone.  im trying to combine a click functioning within a hover.  but i can't seem to nail it.   i've tried a couple of ways, and neither appear to be correct.  does anyone have a moment to look at this?  http://jsfiddle.net/6eZSJ/
[20:09:47] <RobW> gavin_huang: what if you grabbed the width then hid it, such as http://jsfiddle.net/YMHdL/2/
[20:10:33] <gavin_huang> RobW, will that flash the parent element?
[20:10:56] <letterpress> ?ftj @amh345
[20:11:10] <amh345> ??
[20:11:14] <letterpress> oops http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[20:11:31] <letterpress> about using the javascript console.
[20:12:18] <RobW> gavin_huang; possibly
[20:12:22] <RobW> amh345: http://jsfiddle.net/6eZSJ/1/
[20:12:29] <amh345> sorry, my internet is reallllly slow tonight.  does that link show how to combine an hover and click?
[20:12:34] <amh345> letterpress: ^
[20:12:39] <Whirl3d> taggnostr, I don't get what you are trying to do:  http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/GDXqH/6/
[20:12:43] <rick_h__> anyone used jquery mobile with the touch events? The tap/swipe events are failing to work for me on an android test device, 2.3 using mobile a4
[20:12:58] <rick_h__> if I change it to a 'click' binding it works
[20:13:04] <letterpress> well there are lots of things breaking your code. that's why i mention this site.
[20:13:09] <rick_h__> so I know the function is good, just not hitting the right event
[20:13:17] <RobW> letterpress: thats not even valid code tho
[20:13:18] <gavin_huang> letterpress, RobW, may i can combine what you guys suggest. first visibility: hidden, then remove display: inline, and get the width, finally add display: hidden and remove visibility: hidden
[20:13:19] <letterpress> but RobW has boiled it down for you
[20:13:25] <RobW> i think he meant that as an example hehe
[20:13:27] <Whirl3d> taggnostr, that toggles the visibility of your spans every 2 seconds... but that doesn't seem like that's what you want.
[20:13:32] <amh345> RobW: oh, i was waaaay off.   thank you very luch
[20:13:34] <amh345> much
[20:13:49] <RobW> gavin_huang: of course you could
[20:14:04] <RobW> just grab width via: css('visibility', 1).width()
[20:14:07] <RobW> then set it back to 0
[20:14:12] <RobW> may flash.. idk, trial and error it
[20:14:25] <gavin_huang> RobW, thanks!
[20:14:26] <Taggnostr> Whirl3d, the goal is to toggle all the elements and text nodes with the 'toggled' text
[20:14:31] <Whirl3d> set opacity=0
[20:14:48] <Taggnostr> so those 2 blocks between .foo and .bar, but I think I'm getting there
[20:14:49] <RobW> gavin_huang: check out http://www.foliotek.com/devblog/getting-the-width-of-a-hidden-element-with-jquery-using-width/
[20:15:14] <tehOPEologist> hey all, i was wondering if someone was awake that could help me figure out this issue i'm having with jquery tools..
[20:15:29] <RobW> tehOPEologist: nobody's here, try back tomorrow :/
[20:15:39] <tehOPEologist> aw that sucks :(  lol
[20:15:41] <RobW> just kidding.. ask, dont' ask to ask ;)
[20:16:01] <letterpress> amh345 this is how i would approach this http://jsfiddle.net/letterpress/6eZSJ/3/
[20:16:05] <tehOPEologist> i'm trying to do some tooltip hovers on a map, and it seems to be hovering at like the bottom right corner of the page, instead of right above the image
[20:16:28] <RobW> tehOPEologist: are you setting its coords?
[20:16:35] <RobW> (and positioning absolute)
[20:16:43] <tehOPEologist> one moment
[20:17:11] <gavin_huang> RobW, i will check it out. this is what i come up with from you idea: http://jsfiddle.net/YMHdL/3/
[20:17:37] <tehOPEologist> it seems like anything i do doesn't affect the tooltip location
[20:17:50] <tehOPEologist> http://chattanoogadoubledecker.com/wordpress/tour/ is the link..  rollover the icon in the map to see what i'm talking about
[20:17:52] <RobW> gavin_huang: yea, try it on your live page, it doesn't seem to flash here but there's no other content loading
[20:19:49] <RobW> what are you using for tooltip
[20:19:55] <Taggnostr> is elem.replaceWith('<span>' + elem.text() + '</span>'); the right way to wrap in a spand and replace a text node?
[20:19:56] <tehOPEologist> jquery tools
[20:20:15] <tehOPEologist> <script src="http://chattanoogadoubledecker.com/wordpress/wp-content/themes/double_decker_2011/js/jquery.tools.min.js"></script>
[20:20:23] <tehOPEologist> that's what i'm loading
[20:20:30] <imakewebthings> ?wrap @ taggnostr
[20:20:34] <gavin_huang> RobW, works like a charm in my live page. thank you very much. :)
[20:20:47] <RobW> gavin_huang: did you look at that link I sent?
[20:20:51] <imakewebthings> ... wheres bot-t
[20:20:54] <RobW> gavin_huang: check out http://www.foliotek.com/devblog/getting-the-width-of-a-hidden-element-with-jquery-using-width/
[20:21:01] <amh345> letterpress: thanks.  i need to look into this live and bind function.   it appears that if i want to combine i need to use these.
[20:21:22] <RobW> amh345: bind and live are similar, I prefer live while others prefer bind
[20:21:26] <letterpress> if you want live, use my code just change bind to live
[20:21:27] <imakewebthings> taggnostr: http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[20:21:32] <letterpress> and some prefer delegate ;)
[20:21:34] <Taggnostr> yep, found, thanks
[20:21:38] <RobW> ya
[20:22:00] <amh345> thanks guys.  i appreciate the help.
[20:22:51] <tehOPEologist> meow?
[20:22:51] <RobW> tehOPEologist: it's because of your position on #tour_map_container
[20:22:59] <tehOPEologist> oh?
[20:23:03] <tehOPEologist> care to explain?
[20:23:09] <RobW> get rid of relative position and try
[20:23:37] <tehOPEologist> yup
[20:23:41] <RobW> then set height to 1051px
[20:23:41] <tehOPEologist> fixed, soooo sick
[20:23:48] <tehOPEologist> now the thing is
[20:24:01] <gavin_huang> RobW, yeah it basically just did what i do to div to every parent elements. will use it when my current quick and dirty method fails. ;)
[20:24:03] <tehOPEologist> the bottom part of the container is getting covered up
[20:24:15] <RobW> tehOPEologist: fix height as i said
[20:24:34] <RobW> or better yet
[20:24:38] <RobW> get rid of margin-bottom
[20:24:43] <RobW> :)
[20:25:38] <tehOPEologist> welll
[20:25:40] <tehOPEologist> =/
[20:25:52] <tehOPEologist> the thing is, i need that bottom thing to go "around" the map
[20:26:18] <tehOPEologist> needs a 5px margin of white on the bottom
[20:26:31] <RobW> ok and not whatever it is now? (thick) ?
[20:26:36] <tehOPEologist> yeah
[20:26:42] <tehOPEologist> what it used to be when it was relative
[20:26:50] <tehOPEologist> want me to change it back so you can see what i mean?
[20:27:28] <Taggnostr> it's still not working, it hides the first span (foo toggled) but then breaks on the toggled text: http://jsfiddle.net/yDC5A/9/
[20:27:40] <RobW> yes
[20:27:49] <RobW> like the top border..
[20:28:20] <tehOPEologist> yeah
[20:28:30] <RobW> revert it
[20:28:38] <tehOPEologist> one moment
[20:29:01] <tehOPEologist> kk
[20:29:02] <tehOPEologist> reverted
[20:30:31] <RobW> sec
[20:30:44] <tehOPEologist> k
[20:31:51] <imakewebthings> Taggnostr: wrap returns the original element
[20:32:29] <Taggnostr> imakewebthings, how can I fix it? .parent() doesn't seem to work
[20:34:06] <ifndefx> Hi if I'm updating ui object by ui.item.html method, when can I bind the functions from the new html elements ?
[20:36:34] <RobW> tehOPEologist: I can't figure out a work around because of the way you have the site layered and whatnot.
[20:36:46] <tehOPEologist> aw :(
[20:36:52] <RobW> try in your tooltip({}) function, adding top:-1000 and left:-600 or whatever
[20:37:00] <tehOPEologist> k
[20:37:01] <RobW> until you can get it close , to compensate
[20:37:07] <tehOPEologist> lemme try, one sec
[20:38:52] <tehOPEologist> doesn't seem to change anything..  :(
[20:39:06] <Taggnostr> imakewebthings: http://jsfiddle.net/yDC5A/11/ doesn't seem to work either
[20:39:58] <jigz> fx4 is 6x faster than 3.6?
[20:40:31] <RobW> tehOPEologist: maybe you can ask #css how to not use position:relative and fix footer
[20:41:07] <tehOPEologist> hm
[20:41:11] <RobW> because I think for #content_container is where the footer image should be in
[20:41:23] <RobW> and just set the background: #FFF url('content bg') repeat-y 0 0 or whatever
[20:41:33] <RobW> instead of using another div 'bottom_content'
[20:41:44] <tehOPEologist> well, that bottom content is for the rounded bottom
[20:41:48] <tehOPEologist> instead of it being flat
[20:42:15] <tehOPEologist> wait, what if i make that div relative and go under one
[20:42:34] <imakewebthings> taggnostr: is this what you're trying to do? http://jsfiddle.net/yDC5A/12/
[20:42:45] <tehOPEologist> got itttttttttttt
[20:42:48] <tehOPEologist> just thought of it
[20:42:52] <orolo> i'm trying to .each() over the first objects elements from a JSON object. should look like $(data.firstElementName).each(    . .. . Element.label    ?
[20:42:58] <tehOPEologist> heck yes!  >D:>:D>:D>:D>:D
[20:43:01] <tehOPEologist> thanks for the tip man
[20:43:11] <tehOPEologist> gonna add some stuff to the tooltip now.  hopefully it'll work
[20:43:42] <tehOPEologist> do you have any tips as to how to make another div pop up in the same tooltip div when that info link's clicked?
[20:43:52] <tehOPEologist> like, replace the div it's in?
[20:44:06] <Taggnostr> imakewebthings, I'm trying to hide all the nodes (spans and text) with the word 'toggled' in them, and I'm trying to wrap the text nodes in a <span> so I can use .toggle()
[20:44:15] <tehOPEologist> i'm honestly concerned, though, because this tooltip class is one unified class
[20:44:24] <tehOPEologist> there's like 30+ icons on this map..
[20:44:54] <tehOPEologist> how do i do different divs with different tooltips?
[20:45:13] <tehOPEologist> if the only way to use the tooltip thing in jquery tools is to call the class "tooltip"
[20:45:14] <tehOPEologist> ?
[20:45:22] <RobW> tehOPEologist: maybe just grab the id and replace html
[20:45:46] <RobW> but i'm not sure what you mean
[20:46:00] <RobW> replace the "Tennessee Aquarium info >" text?
[20:46:04] <imakewebthings> taggnostr: http://jsfiddle.net/yDC5A/13/
[20:46:04] <tehOPEologist> no
[20:46:10] <tehOPEologist> sorry, i know that was confusing lol
[20:46:25] <tehOPEologist> i mean there's going to be like 30+ different tooltips with different sizes
[20:46:31] <tehOPEologist> and locations and whatnot
[20:46:45] <RobW> so
[20:46:51] <tehOPEologist> and if the div is a class of tooltip
[20:47:12] <tehOPEologist> hold on
[20:47:12] <Taggnostr> imakewebthings, that's only .foo, not the following nodes. At the end you shouldn't see the word 'toggled' anywhere in the output
[20:47:12] <tehOPEologist> lol
[20:47:16] <RobW> jQuery(".tooltip").tooltip
[20:47:35] <tehOPEologist> nvm, i'm an idiot
[20:47:36] <imakewebthings> taggnostr: there was nothing in your original fiddle that applied a class to the new span elements if it contained the word toggle
[20:47:48] <imakewebthings> taggnostr: not sure where you thought that was happening
[20:47:49] <tehOPEologist> no, when i was messing with it earlier, i set the width
[20:47:55] <tehOPEologist> instead of it auto-finding
[20:47:58] <tehOPEologist> i think i got it now :D
[20:48:44] <Taggnostr> imakewebthings, my original fiddle was looping through all the nodes, started to hiding all the elements when .foo was found and stopping when .bar was found
[20:49:05] <Taggnostr> except that after .foo there was a text node and it was failing to wrap/hide it
[20:50:09] <Whirl3d> Yeah, for some reason, when you try $("pre").contents().each(function () {console.log($(this).text()).....   you get the text for the text nodes, but trying to wrap them doesn't work
[20:51:16] <imakewebthings> taggnostr: so what you actually want is to hide everything between .foo and .bar
[20:51:18] <orolo> i need some help w/ JSON and .each(): http://jsfiddle.net/orolo/DBE5n/8/ i can get [Object object] but i can't get any deeper.
[20:51:34] <Taggnostr> imakewebthings, yes, .foo included and .bar excluded
[20:51:42] <imakewebthings> taggnostr: ok
[20:53:29] <imakewebthings> taggnostr: http://jsfiddle.net/yDC5A/14/
[20:53:33] <imakewebthings> nextUntil
[20:54:02] <Taggnostr> does that work with text nodes too?
[20:54:13] <imakewebthings> i dont know.... i left the wrapping thing in
[20:54:17] <imakewebthings> let me try to take it out
[20:54:25] <Taggnostr> oh, right, you wrapped it
[20:54:54] <imakewebthings> doesn't work if i take the wrapping out
[20:54:55] <Taggnostr> that indeed should work, I was trying to use nextUntil at the beginning but moved to the for loop because it couldn't handle the text nodes
[20:55:28] <imakewebthings> that wrapping in there is basically straight out of the .contents() api page
[20:57:36] <tehOPEologist> ah here we go..  this is what i was worried about
[20:57:49] <tehOPEologist> i can't do different tooltips :(
[20:57:55] <RobW> ajpiano: haha I was wondering what those bullets were until I got to last slide
[20:57:56] <tehOPEologist> http://chattanoogadoubledecker.com/wordpress/tour/
[20:58:08] <tehOPEologist> they're supposed to say two different things
[20:58:34] <tehOPEologist> can i add an ID and a class to a div?
[20:58:40] <tehOPEologist> maybe do it that way?
[20:58:42] <Taggnostr> imakewebthings, that works almost ok, I think I can figure out the remaining things on my own now, thanks a lot!
[20:58:55] <imakewebthings> gluck
[20:59:14] <RobW> lol you're doing it wrong
[20:59:18] <tehOPEologist> shit nvm
[20:59:20] <tehOPEologist> i think i found it
[20:59:24] <RobW> set the title
[20:59:29] <tehOPEologist> hold on
[20:59:29] <tehOPEologist> lolz
[21:00:16] <Whirl3d> Can anyone explain scrollTop to me and how it relates to position() of embeded elements?
[21:00:39] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/mhpqA/34/
[21:01:29] <Whirl3d> Although there is a correlation between scrollTop and the position of the embeded elements (using .position().top), I can't figure it out.
[21:08:00] <Taggnostr> the problem now is that the newlines are removed when the spans are toggled
[21:11:01] <Taggnostr> http://jsfiddle.net/yDC5A/15/ in here the .toggle leave an empty line, but the wrapped ones don't
[21:12:57] <jrockjiggz> Taggnostr: not really reading your code, looks like u need recursion
[21:14:47] <Taggnostr> http://jsfiddle.net/yDC5A/16/ here it should be clearer, when it says 'toggled line next' there's an empty line, but when it says '4 toggled lines' there are no empty lines, but there should be 4 empty lines
[21:15:31] <imakewebthings> the new lines are part of the text node
[21:15:47] <Taggnostr> makes sense
[21:17:07] <Taggnostr> I could try to remove the trailing whitespace and add it after the span, or try to wrap only the text without the newlines
[21:17:25] <imakewebthings> i dont know what the application of this whole thing is taggnostr, but why not just set visibility to hidden instead of remove/hide
[21:19:47] <Taggnostr> imakewebthings, here there's a demo of the real application: http://wolfprojects.altervista.org/py/functional.html#generators
[21:20:19] <Taggnostr> if you scroll down a bit till the second yellow block of code and click on the >>> button on the top right, it should remove the >>>/... and the output
[21:21:22] <tehOPEologist> gah, one more issue...  then i promise i'll be done for the night ^_^
[21:21:41] <tehOPEologist> i'm trying to make the tooltip div get toggled when you click the "info" link inside the tooltip
[21:22:06] <tehOPEologist> and it's not toggling
[21:22:06] <tehOPEologist> >_<
[21:22:14] <tehOPEologist> can someone help me out real quick?
[21:22:41] <Taggnostr> imakewebthings, try to reload, now it should work (except that all the traceback is collapsed)
[21:22:45] <tehOPEologist> arg, again with me being retarded.  nvm.
[21:22:45] <tehOPEologist> :)
[21:23:59] <tehOPEologist> well..  no, it's not working like i want it to.
[21:24:01] <tehOPEologist> hm
[21:24:06] <tehOPEologist> can someone take a look at it with me?
[21:24:11] <tehOPEologist> RobW, you still on?
[21:25:57] <tehOPEologist> anyone?
[21:25:59] <tehOPEologist> :(
[21:27:09] <Whirl3d> tehOPEologist, do you have a fiddle setup?
[21:28:33] <Whirl3d> A.D. D. much?
[21:30:01] <tehOPEologist> lol sortof
[21:30:06] <tehOPEologist> i just think i don't know an answer
[21:30:10] <tehOPEologist> i sortof figure it out
[21:30:18] <tehOPEologist> then realize there's another problem =/
[21:47:21] <Whirl3d> something is terribly wrong with Jquery's ScrollTo or Position formulas. It doesn't make any sense at all.
[21:48:38] <brianseeders> you know position isnt relative to the window?
[21:50:52] <tehOPEologist> can someone explain why this div is moving when you re-open it in this map?
[21:51:15] <tehOPEologist> http://chattanoogadoubledecker.com/wordpress/tour/  hover over the left icon below the river to see what i'm talking about
[21:51:21] <tehOPEologist> click the info, then close
[21:51:25] <tehOPEologist> then do it again
[21:51:29] <tehOPEologist> driving me insance
[21:51:31] <tehOPEologist> *insane
[21:51:32] <tehOPEologist> >_<
[21:53:11] <Whirl3d> brianseeders, if you are talking to me, yes, I know that. In fact, it's not even relative to it's parent container like the docs say
[21:53:56] <sholmes> How can I make a complete copy of an input[type=file] element and remove the old one? I need to copy everything about this element including event callbacks but excluding it's value attribute.
[21:55:14] <Whirl3d> tehOPEologist, it seems to work perfectly fine to me
[21:55:21] <brianseeders> yeah it works for me too
[21:55:22] <brianseeders> in chrome
[21:55:53] <Whirl3d> <--chrome here too
[21:56:05] <nixninja> I have a noob question I want to toggle the fadein fadeout of a div with the class of menu-box when the mouse is over a div with the class of header-box how do I do this I tried binding mouseover to header-box but the menu-box bounces in and out it does stay in one state
[21:56:15] <Whirl3d> ?clone@sholmes
[21:56:29] <Whirl3d> omg, bot-t is ignoring me still
[21:56:39] <sholmes> .clone()?
[21:56:42] <brianseeders> ?clone@sholmes
[21:56:42] <sholmes> I'll look it up
[21:57:00] <Whirl3d> I think clone might work for you....sholmes...
[21:57:59] <ifndefx> hi when I define $("#myId").click(function(){...}); can I pass another variable into the cick function something like this var count=1; $("#myId").click(function(count){...}); ?
[21:58:06] <vladikoff_> you?
[21:58:06] <Lampoon> you are a gobshite
[21:58:31] <dravekx> anyone have simple documentation for creating a custom checkbox? I need one. trying to learn. :)
[22:00:24] <ifndefx> dravekx: try http://blogs.digitss.com/javascript/jquery-javascript/jquery-fancy-custom-radio-and-checkbox/
[22:00:39] <dravekx> ifndefx, thanks.
[22:00:51] <gadlol_> I have a jquery question for animate. Can I post it here?
[22:02:12] <nixninja> $('[class=header-box]').mouseover(function() { $('[class=menu-box]').fadein();}) this should work right?
[22:03:19] <wookiehangover> nixninja: use css style selectors
[22:03:26] <wookiehangover> $('.header-box')
[22:03:42] <wookiehangover> also, http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[22:04:49] <wookiehangover> and if you're new to jquery, by all means read this first http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html
[22:04:53] <gadlol_> is there a way to now when animate() is running. Not in specific element but general. I have a plugin and right now i must check five and more elements to see if animating examp: $testDiv.is(':animated')
[22:04:56] <nixninja> thank you
[22:05:22] <wookiehangover> and if you're new to javascript, read through this as well http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[22:06:01] <wookiehangover> gadlol_: you've got it right http://api.jquery.com/animated-selector/
[22:08:13] <nixninja> $('.header-box').mouseover(function(){ $('.menu-box').fadein(); }) <-----why isn't it working?
[22:08:20] <gadlol_> it is not good because i have to check lots of elements together, PERHAPS jQuery WOULD BE GOOD if while there is an animation to set a variable to true for general animation in the webpage...
[22:08:29] <wookiehangover> paste an example at http://jsfiddle.net/
[22:08:42] <nixninja> me?
[22:09:18] <wookiehangover> gadlol_: you know you can alway USE jquery WITH YOUR OWN APPLICATION LOGIC
[22:09:28] <Mysphyt> nixninja: Yup, please.  It's much easier to answer "why isn't it working" questions if we can see it not working.
[22:09:49] <wookiehangover> usually there's a bot around to explain teh basics
[22:09:51] <wookiehangover> but alas
[22:09:54] <Mysphyt> nixninja: Although to hazard a guess: isn't the method name .fadeIn(), not fadein()?
[22:10:02] <wookiehangover> our bots have departed
[22:10:12] <nixninja> you want the css file too or is seeing the html and javascript good enough?
[22:10:17] <wookiehangover> Mysphyt +1
[22:10:22] <gadlol_> look at the code, i am using a function to check 6 elements http://jsfiddle.net/Yu39q/
[22:10:53] <wookiehangover> gadlol_: do you know how js treats logical operators?
[22:10:54] <gadlol_> what if there were 50 elements??????
[22:11:02] <sholmes> Seems to work. But could someone let me know if there's a shortcut to doing this:
[22:11:09] <gadlol_> probably yes
[22:11:09] <sholmes> 		$betabin.find('.upload input[type=file]')
[22:11:10] <Mysphyt> gadlol_: It probably wouldn't be worse than six question marks.
[22:11:10] <sholmes> 			.clone(true)
[22:11:10] <sholmes> 			.appendTo('#betabin .upload form');
[22:11:10] <sholmes> 		$betabin.find('.upload input[type=file]').eq(0).remove();
[22:12:04] <gadlol_> [08:11] <Mysphyt> gadlol_: It probably wouldn't be worse than six question marks.   I DID NOT UNDERSTAND
[22:12:18] <nixninja> http://jsfiddle.net/xu5JX/
[22:13:17] <Mysphyt> gadlol_: That's what the question mark is *for,* isn't it?  Do the other five add something I don't know about?
[22:13:40] <wookiehangover> gadlol_: so your code would never work anyway, because logical operators in if statements evaluate from left to right
[22:14:06] <wookiehangover> eg, false || true || true || true === false
[22:14:26] <wookiehangover> true || false || true === false
[22:14:36] <wookiehangover> etc
[22:14:52] <wookiehangover> if you're doing complex animatrions
[22:15:11] <gadlol_> the code works fine, the question mark is inside the $() /// its another way to use the if statement /// opera has a bug, thats why i am using it like this
[22:15:13] <wookiehangover> like with over 9000 element or whatever
[22:15:57] <wookiehangover> gadlol_: you're misusing a ternary
[22:16:06] <wookiehangover> if thats what you're asking about
[22:16:19] <wookiehangover> and that code makes no sense
[22:16:31] <wookiehangover> but anyway
[22:17:15] <wookiehangover> with complex animations, you should consider binding custom events, which you later trigger and combine that with a global locking variable and you're all set
[22:17:46] <gadlol_> check now http://jsfiddle.net/Yu39q/1/
[22:18:08] <nixninja> I don't understand why this isn't working http://jsfiddle.net/xu5JX/2/
[22:18:24] <Mysphyt> nixninja: Two shakes, I'm taking a look.
[22:18:32] <nixninja> ty
[22:18:34] <SoulRaven> hi
[22:19:07] <wookiehangover> gadlol_: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_Operators
[22:19:32] <wookiehangover> and that's now how ternary's work
[22:20:02] <wookiehangover> condition ? "truthy" : "falsy"
[22:20:05] <SoulRaven> is it posibile to check if a file was changed? i want to check on interval of 1 hour ?
[22:20:08] <wookiehangover> you've got a comma in ther
[22:20:35] <wookiehangover> SoulRaven: not from the browser
[22:20:50] <SoulRaven> with jquery
[22:21:04] <SoulRaven> is it posibile, workers, jquery, something
[22:21:20] <paul_irish> what file
[22:21:31] <nixninja> ajax to php have php test for changes
[22:21:37] <SoulRaven> a get from ajax...
[22:22:02] <sholmes> How do I clone and remove the original one and replace it with the new one?
[22:22:40] <SoulRaven> but how i make the function to check on regular time ?
[22:22:50] <wookiehangover> sholmes: var x = $('#blah').clone(); $('#blah').remove(); $('.whatever').append( x )
[22:23:18] <wookiehangover> SoulRaven: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[22:23:32] <sholmes> wookiehangover: there's not quicker way than this?
[22:23:32] <sholmes> 		$betabin.find('.upload input[type=file]').clone(true).appendTo('#betabin .upload form');
[22:23:32] <sholmes> 		$betabin.find('.upload input[type=file]').eq(0).remove();
[22:24:16] <kvnn> I keep trying to send .delegate a list of selectors or bindings. For example, $('body').delegate( 'a , span' , 'click, hover' , my_functon)
[22:24:20] <kvnn> is there a way to do that?
[22:25:39] <wookiehangover> ?tias
[22:25:43] <nixninja> really basic quetions or it seems basic I'm trying to fadein on mouseover but its not working can someone take a look? http://jsfiddle.net/xu5JX/2/
[22:25:48] <wookiehangover> bot-t: ffffffffffffffuuuuuuuuuuuu
[22:26:08] <mikemonk> hi guys :) best web dev books/resources?
[22:26:19] <Mysphyt> nixninja: I've never played with mouseover/out, but here: http://jsfiddle.net/mysphyt/xu5JX/4/
[22:26:25] <wookiehangover> http://eloquentjavascript.net/
[22:26:30] <wookiehangover> http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html
[22:26:58] <Mysphyt> nixninja: First of all, there was no $('.menu-box') element; the class you used was 'menu-bar'
[22:27:17] <Mysphyt> nixninja: Second, if you want the element to fade in, you need to set display: none or similar in the CSS.
[22:27:18] <nixninja> aaaahhhhh
[22:27:21] <nixninja> doh
[22:27:35] <nixninja> thank you
[22:27:38] <kvnn> sholmes : you can use .end() at the end of your first statement, then .eq(0).remove()
[22:27:49] <Mysphyt> nixninja: More coming, don't go anywhere.  :P
[22:28:02] <kvnn> sholmes : if you just do an appendTo, you shouldn't need to clone then remove, right?
[22:28:22] <gadlol_> a jQuery addon proposition:: Whenever animate is running, there should be somewhere (maybe in the scope) a variable that would say that animate is running.
[22:28:43] <Mysphyt> nixninja: Third, your script never ran anyway, because it wasn't attached to anything.  Code you want to run when the page is loaded should be executed in $(document).ready(function() { //your code here });
[22:28:51] <wookiehangover> gadlol_: write a plugin then http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring
[22:29:33] <mikemonk> hi guys :)  best web dev books/resources?
[22:29:37] <sholmes> Kvnn, you mean if I just use appendTo on the original, I wont need to clone at all?
[22:29:38] <Mysphyt> nixninja: And fourth, if you want it to fade out on mouseout, you need to bind a function to mouseout to accomplish that.  :)
[22:29:44] <kvnn> sholmes : yeah
[22:29:55] <sholmes> Hmm, let me see if that will suffice
[22:29:56] <Mysphyt> mikemonk: Didn't you just ask that question, and didn't wookiehangover just answer you?
[22:30:07] <kvnn> sholmes : but end() would be a good way to join those statements otherwise
[22:30:18] <kvnn> http://api.jquery.com/appendTo/
[22:30:26] <kvnn> 'moves, does not clone'
[22:30:27] <mikemonk> Mysphyt: yes, but that only covers javascript right?
[22:30:35] <sholmes> kvnn: yeah, doesn't look like appendTo cuts the cake.
[22:30:41] <kvnn> sholmes: why?
[22:30:43] <Mysphyt> mikemonk: Yes.  But you're in #jquery.
[22:31:02] <wookiehangover> w3fools.com
[22:31:03] <sholmes> kvnn: moving an input[type=file] element does not remove it's value.
[22:31:12] <sholmes> that's what I'm after here.
[22:31:38] <mikemonk> i know, but i thought that i could reach some web devs here that could refer me to more holistic resources...
[22:31:42] <kvnn> sholmes : then why not appendTo, then remove the value?
[22:32:15] <kvnn> mikemonk : web development is not actually a sturdy topic. You have front-end development, back-end development, design, ux, and gay ass business stuff
[22:32:18] <sholmes> remove the value?
[22:32:26] <kvnn> sholmes : blank it. .val()
[22:32:38] <sholmes> I try .val('') but that doesn't seem to want to work on input[type=file] elements
[22:32:52] <kvnn> sholmes: is that a file upload or something?
[22:32:54] <Mysphyt> wookiehangover: I totally take w3fools.com's point, but at the same time, I don’t know that there's an equally wide-ranging resource out there that doesn't suck.
[22:33:09] <mikemonk> kvnn: best resources and order to learn about it?
[22:33:15] <sholmes> kvnn: yes it is, that's why I've been saying input[type=file] all this time. :P
[22:33:32] <kvnn> lol, I'm just unfamiliar with that selector
[22:33:33] <Mysphyt> mikemonk: If you're starting from scratch, oksushi is right over in #css--start with HTML, and then learn CSS.
[22:33:37] <nixninja> Why does it not stay in one state or the other it bounces in and out of state? http://jsfiddle.net/mysphyt/xu5JX/4/
[22:34:06] <kvnn> sholmes : just use your originals and use a .end() on the first statement to attach the second statement. you may have to use it more than once in a row. http://api.jquery.com/end/
[22:34:16] <Mysphyt> mikemonk: The other technologies in play (JS, PHP, etc) all basically manipulate those two in more or less fancy ways.
[22:34:25] <kvnn> mikemonk : I agree, learn HTML and CSS first. Then Javascript IMO
[22:34:31] <Mysphyt> nixninja: Sorry, got distracted.  I think the problem there is that you'
[22:34:33] <sholmes> Here's my joined statement: $betabin.find('.upload input[type=file]')
[22:34:34] <sholmes> 			.clone(true)
[22:34:34] <sholmes> 			.appendTo('#betabin .upload form')
[22:34:34] <sholmes> 			.end()
[22:34:34] <sholmes> 			.remove();
[22:34:46] <kvnn> I think thats right
[22:34:57] <sholmes> I thought so too, but doesn't appear to even work. :(
[22:35:02] <kvnn> actually, you shouldn't need .end()
[22:35:11] <Mysphyt> nixninja: you're getting mouseover events whenever you enter any of the child divs, but that's just a guess.
[22:35:41] <nixninja> would hover be better?
[22:35:56] <mikemonk> ok thanks guys :)
[22:36:00] <sholmes> but if I don't use .end() then I'll be removing the clone? :S
[22:36:04] <kvnn> sholmes : you shouldn't need .end() because .appendTo is still acting on your original selector if I have it right
[22:36:07] <wookiehangover> Mysphyt: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/4431744/1229914-lebowski_opinion_super.jpeg
[22:36:35] <Mysphyt> wookiehangover: YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR ELEMENT.
[22:36:40] <sholmes> kvnn: you don't have it right. .clone() returns the cloned element, appendTo acts on the cloned element.
[22:36:56] <sholmes> maybe .end doesn't work on returns from clone
[22:37:01] <kvnn> sholmes : thats what i'm thinking now
[22:37:05] <sholmes> returns from .clone*
[22:37:20] <sholmes> Hmm, maybe the two statements will have to do.
[22:37:26] <Mysphyt> nixninja: Switching to mousenter/mouseleave seems to have the desired effet: http://jsfiddle.net/mysphyt/xu5JX/6/
[22:37:45] <sholmes> or I could use .sibling!
[22:37:47] <kvnn> sholmes : maybe give it an ID so you can remove it quickly in the second statement
[22:37:57] <kvnn> sholmes : yeah
[22:38:14] <nixninja> yeah I just tested that too :) thank you Mysphyt
[22:38:28] <kvnn> thats smart. use .siblings(input[type=file]) or whatever
[22:38:31] <Mysphyt> nixninja: NP.
[22:38:37] <kvnn> sholmes: can you give that input an ID? that would be quicker.
[22:38:51] <kvnn> you'd have to change its id when you clone it
[22:39:14] <kvnn> I keep trying to send .delegate a list of selectors or bindings. For example, $('body').delegate( 'a , span' , 'click, hover' , my_functon)
[22:39:22] <sholmes> This works like a condom: $betabin.find('.upload input[type=file]')
[22:39:22] <sholmes> 			.clone(true).appendTo('#betabin .upload form')
[22:39:23] <sholmes> 			.siblings('input[type=file]').remove();
[22:39:38] <kvnn> nice work.
[22:40:07] <sholmes> That'll do. I feel good about this. Thanks kvnn. :)
[22:40:16] <Mysphyt> sholmes: i.e., 99.9% of the time there's no problem, but that one time in a thousand you end up with a kid?
[22:40:18] <kvnn> haha for sure
[22:40:32] <kvnn> you end up with a .clone()
[22:40:38] <Mysphyt> Heh.
[22:40:43] <sholmes> kvnn: well that's the idea.
[22:40:56] <sholmes> Maybe it doesn't work like a condom as much as I originally though.
[22:40:58] <sholmes> thought*
[22:41:00] <kvnn> Is there a way to send delegate a list of selectors or bindings? For example: $('body').delegate( 'a , span' , 'click, hover' , my_functon)
[22:41:04] <slavka`> anyone use javascriptmvc?
[22:44:27] <kvnn> Alright, according to http://threedubmedia.com/demo/delegate/ #4, I can do this : .delegate('mouseover mouseout','.layer0, .layer1, .layer2, .layer3',function(){
[22:52:41] <Justin__> how do I reset this form with jquery? https://gist.github.com/972907
[22:53:22] <paul_irish> $('form#new_showable_video')[0].reset()
[22:55:00] <pr0ton_> hi, i've got a javascript doubt
[22:55:30] <Justin__> paul_irish: for some reason it doesn't work for my case?
[22:55:44] <pr0ton_> http://pastebin.com/rtPhFXk5
[22:55:58] <Justin__> paul_irish: possibly because the user can select an element from an autocomplete list, and upon selection an AJAX request is sent
[22:56:02] <pr0ton_> it says for this line... geocoder.geocode({ 	'address': data[i].location
[22:56:07] <pr0ton_> that data[i] is undefined
[22:56:12] <pr0ton_> how do you get around this?
[23:00:07] <pr0ton_> better paste
[23:00:07] <pr0ton_> http://pastebin.com/DarVyi1S
[23:00:24] <pr0ton_> anybody?
[23:01:18] <pr0ton_> i think, it's some error with scope, which i dont understand
[23:01:30] <brianseeders> it is
[23:02:02] <brianseeders> that part is inside of a setTimeout and has a reference to i
[23:02:15] <brianseeders> by the time it executes, i == data.length
[23:02:35] <pr0ton_> brianseeders, yeah. i kinda figured that out, but how do i get around it?
[23:09:28] <Whirl3d> Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling, anybody know what's really going on with position()/offset()/scrollHeight()/scrollTop(), etc. ?
[23:09:46] <kaepora> Hello, can anyone please help me figure out how I can make an HTTP POST of a form using jquery?
[23:10:14] <kaepora> Hello, can anyone please help me figure out how I can make an HTTP POST of a form using jquery? I found this: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ but I'm confused as to how to tell it to just send the data in a certain form :< please help!
[23:10:24] <kaepora> (Sorry for the double post)
[23:11:22] <brianseeders> pr0ton_: http://jsfiddle.net/vrXHz/
[23:16:25] <Whirl3d> How is it that this channel is home to some of the biggest brains in Jquery and javascript and they ain't not a one big brained fella dat knows about da scrollin....rough.
[23:17:48] <brianseeders> do you have an example of something that doesnt work the way you think it should
[23:18:10] <pr0ton_> kaepora, $.post
[23:18:21] <pr0ton_> or $.ajax (type: 'POST', ...);
[23:18:33] <Whirl3d> brianseeders, you talking to me?
[23:18:37] <brianseeders> yeah
[23:18:42] <Whirl3d> sure.
[23:18:44] <brianseeders> you might have already posted something
[23:18:47] <brianseeders> i havent been watching chat
[23:18:49] <kaepora> pr0ton_: Yes, but how do I make it post a certain form? How do I select the form?
[23:18:56] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/mhpqA/54/
[23:19:19] <pr0ton_> kaepora, using the selector $('#formID').submit() { .. }
[23:19:38] <pr0ton_> i think you can select all input fields like, $('#formID :input')
[23:19:45] <pr0ton_> then for each field, you get it's name and value
[23:20:09] <pr0ton_> and generate a list of key,value pairs which you give to your data attribute of $.post / $.ajax
[23:20:43] <pr0ton_> brianseeders, why do i need to wrap it inside another function?
[23:20:52] <Whirl3d> if you look at the values for the positions of each of the anchors, it makes no sense at all. I have tried a dozen formulas with the information I have avalable and not a single one of them comes close to approximating the location of the anchors relative to their scrollable parent
[23:21:45] <kaepora> pr0ton_: I just want to submit the entire form.
[23:22:07] <pr0ton_> yeah, you can do that
[23:23:43] <iman> do you have simple sample of validate in jquery ?
[23:23:59] <agib> has anyone else noticed issues with mouseenter/leave in both 1.6 and 1.6.1?
[23:25:05] <pr0ton_> kaepora, this should work i guess
[23:25:06] <pr0ton_> http://jsfiddle.net/ZByUC/
[23:25:21] <pr0ton_> brianseeders, why do i need to wrap it inside another function?
[23:27:14] <kaepora> pr0ton_: Thanks!
[23:27:31] <pr0ton_> kaepora, it *should* work. not tested
[23:28:49] <hgwells42> I have <input type="button" value="click me" id="mybutton">.  in jquery, i have $("#mybutton").click(function() { alert("hi"); });   // it doesn't work.  am i doing something wrong?
[23:29:27] <pr0ton_> hgwells42, maybe .submit() works, since it's a button
[23:29:33] <pr0ton_> i think.click() is for <a>
[23:29:39] <pr0ton_> not entirely sure, try it though
[23:31:58] <agib> ugggg do I really have to downgrade to 1.5.2 to get mouseenter and leave to work??
[23:32:01] <Caraes_Naur> click is for anything
[23:38:55] <Whirl3d> brianseeders, did I stump ya? I'm telling you the logic is wack behind scrollTop, position, etc.
[23:40:28] <hgwells42> i just wrapped everything in $(document).ready(function() { ...previous code here... }); and now it works.  I didn't know that was necessary
[23:47:49] <Whirl3d> Okay, giving up on jquery for Saturday night. Ima go get my cocktail on and I'll catch y'all later.
[23:47:52] <Whirl3d> gnite
[23:48:36] <brianseeders> $("#scroller").animate({scrollTop:anch.position().top+scrollTop},2000);
[23:50:53] <jrockjiggz> i'm binding with die()   e.g.   $('el').die('click').live('click', function(){});  -- but, the die() is not clearing previous binds..... anyway to investigate?
[23:52:01] <jrockjiggz> i don't get it.. it shouldn't happen!
[23:52:49] <ruby_on_tails> i am doing an ajax request and the data i am getting has a div with a js code inside wrapped up in <script> tags, how can i execute this js ? its not executing
[23:53:13] <ruby_on_tails> it should render a chart, but its blank
[23:53:35] <ruby_on_tails> i am basically replacing some old content with the new data which is a div with that js code inside
[23:54:29] <jrockjiggz> post your ajax code
[23:54:42] <ruby_on_tails> paste ?
[23:55:05] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: can you reduce it?
[23:55:33] <gnarf> jrockjiggz: if you want... poke around at $(document).data("events") -- I think thats where all the live's are stored
[23:55:39] <gnarf> might be window?
[23:55:40] <gnarf> i dunno
[23:55:51] <ruby_on_tails> http://pastebin.com/25494n9y here is the code jrockjiggz
[23:56:07] <ruby_on_tails> the data has a js code wrapped inside i div, i need it to execute
[23:57:23] <gnarf> ruby_on_tails: any chance you could put the js code in this function instead? after you inject the data?
[23:57:50] <ruby_on_tails> gnarf: no, the entire ajax request itself is to get custom js code for chart rendering
[23:58:01] <gnarf> ruby_on_tails: can you make it serve only the js?
[23:58:07] <gnarf> because then you could just .getScript() it
[23:58:13] <ruby_on_tails> umm
[23:58:31] <gnarf> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getScript
[23:58:49] <ruby_on_tails> gnarf: cant i use getscript on a portion of an html data which will be js ?
[23:58:53] <gnarf> ruby_on_tails: the problem you're facing is that jQuery trys pretty hard to avoid injecting/rerunning scripts
[23:59:04] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[23:59:10] <gnarf> ruby_on_tails: it has to be javascript
[23:59:15] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[23:59:27] <gnarf> you could encode some html as a string at the end tho
[23:59:31] <ruby_on_tails> ok anyway to trigger the js after the data has been loaded onto the page ?
[23:59:41] <ruby_on_tails> removing html would be tough
