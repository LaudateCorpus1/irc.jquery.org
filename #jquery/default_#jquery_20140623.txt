[00:11:06] <Zak> wait, i take that back.. you can definitely create events on normal JS objects. They don't need to be elements
[00:11:31] <Zak> var o = {}; $(o).on('custom', function() { debugger; }); $(o).trigger('custom');
[00:11:35] <Zak> ^ works
[00:42:35] <Cork> Zak: well yes and no, what i meant is that isn't event listeners
[00:42:46] <Cork> Zak: it is internal emulations inside jquery
[00:44:24] <tables> document.getElementById(file.id).getElementsByTagName('b')[0].innerHTML = '<span>' + file.percent + "%</span>";              <-- how do i send that to a modal instead?
[00:44:59] <Cork> tables: define "modal"
[00:45:11] <Cork> your talking about a jquery ui dialog?
[00:45:12] <tables> a popup modal
[00:45:13] <tables> yes
[00:45:15] <tables> jquery ui dialog
[00:45:26] <cannap> hi i have a question my dom is async generated http://laravel.io/bin/RD0Xq but how can i call a plugin then?
[00:45:40] <Cork> $('<div>').html(file.percent).dialog({ modal: true })
[00:45:49] <cannap> the click event is working but not with the plugin
[00:46:37] <cannap> generated with http://www.datatables.net/
[00:46:39] <Cork> cannap: delegate the event handler to a none dynamic parent
[00:46:39] <cannap> the dom
[00:46:45] <cannap> oO
[00:47:15] <Cork> ?g site:api.jquery.com delegate
[00:47:17] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[00:48:54] <cannap> got it working
[00:48:56] <cannap> thx
[00:50:00] <cannap> hmm many tiems i need 2 clicks
[00:50:02] <cannap> oO
[01:06:46] <Snoopal> hi guys. for some reason I cannot use $ in my js but it works with jQuery instead. how can I change this?
[01:07:14] <_rgn> there's no such thing as "for some reason"
[01:07:16] <_rgn> there's always a reason
[01:07:18] <Cork> Snoopal: you're either using a library that grabs $
[01:07:30] <Cork> or you're calling jQuery.noConflict
[01:08:08] <Snoopal> i use wordpress and it includes automatically jquery and jquery migrate maybe this makes the problem?
[01:08:29] <Cork> no none of those releases $ by default
[01:08:32] <Snoopal> hmm
[01:08:39] <cannap> hmm this works but i need two clicks http://laravel.io/bin/QqMB3 to open the popConfirm box
[01:09:10] <Cork> cannap: popConfirm() prob binds an event handler internally
[01:09:19] <Cork> cannap: if so, then this won't help you
[01:09:40] <cannap> fack
[01:09:41] <cannap> :D
[01:09:59] <cannap> i modify the plugin
[01:14:26] <cannap> write my own plugin^^
[01:15:17] <Cork> cannap: or just use the jquery ui dialog
[01:22:06] <cannap> http://bootboxjs.com/index.html#about
[01:22:08] <cannap> found this
[01:22:13] <cannap> this works fine

[01:50:43] <BulleTime> hi there
[01:50:54] <BulleTime> anyone knows the packery plugin:
[01:50:59] <BulleTime> http://packery.metafizzy.co/
[01:51:16] <BulleTime> im having an issue with it, and i hope someone can help
[02:01:52] <ufk> when I create and $.ajax with method post, content type multipart/formdata and data that is a FormData(), i get  Illegal invocation
[02:02:16] <Cork> ufk: did you set the processData option?
[02:03:40] <ufk> no...
[02:03:48] <ufk> setting the processData to false
[02:06:20] <ufk> the php server side isn't getting the file uploaded with formdata as $_FILES
[02:06:42] <Cork> ufk: how are you adding the file to the FormData?
[02:07:10] <ufk> actually the server side isn't getting anything.. not in post and not in files
[02:07:41] <ufk> 	var fileData = document.getElementById('cocktail_picture_input').files[0]; formData.append('cocktail_image_file',fileData);
[02:08:18] <Cork> and how are you creating formData?
[02:08:28] <Cork> bah
[02:08:34] <Cork> ufk: make a fiddle with the code
[02:09:07] <ufk> big project will make it hard to fiddle
[02:09:22] <ufk> var formData = new FormData();
[02:09:30] <Cork> ufk: i didn't ask for the full project...
[02:09:58] <ufk> ahah ok let me try to fiddle this
[02:14:56] <ufk> http://jsfiddle.net/kfirufk/N3L66/
[02:24:27] <Cork> ufk: try setting contentType to false
[02:24:40] <Cork> ufk: but ya, that should work
[02:24:57] <Cork> ufk: except if you do it in a browser without FormData support that is
[02:26:01] <ufk> trying contentype false
[02:26:54] <ufk> ok i get post with that.. checking if i get the fil
[02:26:56] <ufk> file
[02:27:29] <ufk> ok great that fixes it. thanks
[02:51:48] <Xliff> Cork: You are da man.

[03:16:00] <BulleTime> hi there, anyone out there know why my changes to block.tpl in block module not work?
[03:16:25] <Cork> BulleTime: you're most likely asking in the wrong channel
[03:16:36] <BulleTime> oouigh yeah
[03:20:29] <gnu_d> Hi, from aspect of elegance, having hardcoded elements in the javascript code is ugly, what's a standard approach of keeping container item inside an html template ?
[03:21:22] <Cork> gnu_d: there is several solutions for that
[03:21:45] <Cork> gnu_d: <script type="text/template"></script> is an old example
[03:21:57] <Cork> or just <div id="templates"></div>
[03:22:10] <Cork> or the new <template> tag (not fully cross browser yet though)
[03:23:27] <gnu_d> Cork: so, basically I make the item template inside the code with an id and make it hidden ?
[03:23:40] <gnu_d> s/code/html code/
[03:23:45] <Cork> gnu_d: the <script> and <template> one makes it text
[03:23:53] <Cork> while the hidden div makes it hidden dom objects
[03:24:29] <Cork> gnu_d: with the text solution you can have placeholder markers that is later replaced before you insert the html
[03:29:36] <gnu_d> Cork: but I need to be cross browser
[03:30:00] <Cork> gnu_d: both the <script> and hidden div is cross browser
[03:30:28] <Cork> <template> is a new tag that basically does what <script type="text/template"> has been hacked to do
[03:31:10] <Cork> gnu_d: if you need some templating logic there are plenty of libs to help you do that
[03:31:30] <Cork> (jqote2, mustash, underscore, ...)
[03:35:29] <gnu_d> Cork: mustn't change anything, I need something simple :)
[03:35:42] <Cork> huh?
[03:36:13] <Cork> gnu_d: make a small jsfiddle with the snippet you have problem with
[03:37:30] <gnu_d> Cork: I'm not having a problem with anything, the snippet is just several divs inside each other, the thing is, the divs are hardcoded in the js code, which is stupid, what I need is a way to put that template item inside the html code, so it won't mess the code
[03:37:51] <Cork> gnu_d: make a fiddle
[03:40:58] <DansVC> hi :D
[03:41:13] <DansVC> I have a problem and I don't know why
[03:41:23] <DansVC> this is my code:
[03:41:24] <DansVC> var size = 0;
[03:41:24] <DansVC>                     for (var img = 0; img < data.Apps[id].images.length; img++) {
[03:41:24] <DansVC>                         $("#dimg").append("<img src=" + data.Apps[id].images[img] + " height='100%' />");
[03:41:24] <DansVC>                         size = size + $("#dimg>img").eq(i).width();
[03:41:24] <DansVC>                         console.log($("#dimg>img"));
[03:41:24] <DansVC>                     }
[03:41:24] <DansVC>                     $("#dimg").width(size);
[03:41:47] <Cork> ?p
[03:41:51] <DansVC> the data is already defined
[03:41:54] <paulvd> hello, i am using jquery to pass parameters in a url, is there any way to hide thost parameters ?
[03:42:16] <Cork> DansVC: don't post multi line code in the channel
[03:42:22] <Cork> DansVC: make a fiddle
[03:42:26] <DansVC> ok
[03:42:55] <Cork> paulvd: you you could make it a bit more hidden by doing a POST instead of a GET
[03:42:59] <Cork> but that's it
[03:43:33] <gnu_d> Cork: sorry for wating: http://jsfiddle.net/GuSXr/2/
[03:44:35] <Cork> gnu_d: http://jsfiddle.net/GuSXr/3/
[03:45:14] <gnu_d> Cork: I was looking for the clone :)
[03:45:33] <Cork> gnu_d: or http://jsfiddle.net/GuSXr/4/
[03:45:37] <DansVC> http://jsfiddle.net/9uC5v/
[03:45:42] <Cork> opps typo
[03:45:49] <Cork> * http://jsfiddle.net/GuSXr/5/
[03:46:21] <Cork> DansVC: define "problem"
[03:46:47] <DansVC> the size return 0 :s
[03:47:10] <DansVC> and all images have a width
[03:47:40] <Cork> DansVC: you need to attach load event handlers on the images
[03:47:44] <Cork> and wait for them to load
[03:48:05] <DansVC> ok, i will try it
[03:50:18] <gnu_d> Cork: this is better, thanks :)
[03:50:58] <Cork> gnu_d: np
[03:54:44] <DansVC> Cork, still not working :s http://jsfiddle.net/9uC5v/1/
[03:54:56] <gnu_d> Cork: weird, I can't use the find option when using .html, how do I make it as jquery object before adding it to the container, so I can replace the values ?
[03:55:23] <Cork> DansVC: you risk missing the event like that
[03:55:30] <Cork> DansVC: one min and i'll try to restructure it
[03:55:38] <DansVC> ok
[03:55:42] <DansVC> thx Cork
[03:55:53] <Cork> gnu_d: $(eml.html())
[03:57:32] <motaka2> hello I want to make the width of an element twice of another element
[03:57:37] <motaka2> what should I do ?
[03:58:35] <gnu_d> Cork: oh, I found the issue :D, it wasn't the code, it was the html template it self, jquery guess want valid html code, I had newline escape \ in the html file, so jquery raised syntax exception, making the html code valid, fixed the issue.
[03:58:36] <DansVC> hi motaka2, try $("#div1).width($("#div2").width()*2)
[03:59:08] <motaka2> DansVC: Thx checking ....
[03:59:36] <Cork> DansVC: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/9uC5v/3/
[04:00:58] <motaka2> DansVC: Nor working:  Is this right?   $curInput.wrap($("<div class='" + confsFin.inSearchWrapClassName + "'></div>")
[04:00:58] <motaka2> 						.width($curInput.width() * Number($curInput.attr("data-widthRatio"))))
[04:00:58] <motaka2> 						;
[04:01:15] <Cork> motaka2: don't post multi line html in the channel
[04:05:09] <DansVC> I don't know the property wrap
[04:05:16] <DansVC> and the API of Jquery is down :C
[04:05:54] <Cork> DansVC: its a helper function that creates a new dom element and moves the old one (from the selector) into it
[04:06:04] <motaka2> DansVC: Ok thanks using your tip I fixed it
[04:06:08] <Cork> so the result is that the elements are "wrapped" in it
[04:06:24] <motaka2> Cork: Ok, using a new chat client I thought it is just oneline
[04:06:52] <arschmitz> DansVC: api.jquery.com is not down http://isitupordown.com/api.jquery.com
[04:07:31] <DansVC> I don't have access or now i have a very small connection
[04:08:26] <DansVC> *very low
[04:19:37] <DansVC> Cork are you there?
[04:20:06] <Cork> DansVC: just ask the question if you have one, don't ask for a person
[04:20:36] <DansVC> thats it still not working :s
[04:21:00] <DansVC> and this time it dont load the image
[04:21:24] <hirsty> Hey all, what is the best way to return values from multiple select boxes within an array (name=test[]")?
[04:22:38] <Cork> DansVC: most likely cause data is an array not an object
[04:22:53] <Cork> DansVC: http://jsfiddle.net/9uC5v/4/
[04:23:14] <Cork> hirsty: params can't hold arrays
[04:23:35] <Cork> hirsty: but just give the select boxes the name="test[]"
[04:23:42] <Cork> and use serialize() and jquery will do the rest
[04:29:29] <DansVC> thx Cork :D
[04:51:22] <BulleTime> hi,.
[04:51:49] <BulleTime> i have a [object HTMLDivElement]. how do i use .length() on it ?
[04:52:07] <BulleTime> $(item.element).length() returns in error
[04:57:03] <Cork> BulleTime: length isn't a function
[04:59:16] <BulleTime> seen
[05:22:02] <R13ose> how come the accordion here: http://development.carinarose.com/projects/hatley-house-ecologite-maison-plaire-chabot/ in the left side below the slideshow works correctly but the accordion here: http://development.carinarose.com/product/green-arrow-plume/ collapses the first paragraph text but not all of it up to Addition Information link in the right side?
[05:35:47] <R13ose> any ideas?
[06:08:39] <Stiffler> hello could I ask about code check? I can't find typo

[06:13:09] <GreekFreak> hi all.
[06:14:52] <GreekFreak> I'm setting an input within a modal window as Autocomplete. I correctly set the "appendTo" option, but when the resulting "drop down" is larger than the Modal, it adds scroll bars to the Modal. I would rather have the "drop down" go above the modal (no scrolls). How do I do that?
[06:14:57] <hirsty> Whats the easiest way to fix this - as i think this is my issues....currently i am pulling data using ajax which includes input elements, on changing these elements it is not submitted with the form wrapper
[06:35:45] <djQuery> how would I assign a value to this object      obj[div].errorCount++     I know that obj will exist but I don't know that obj[div] will exist much less obj[div].errorCount
[06:36:10] <djQuery> I know I could just use nested if statements was just looking for something a little more elegant
[06:39:50] <xec> you might be able to get away with something like: obj[div] && obj[div].errorCount && obj[div].errorCount++
[06:44:05] <djQuery> xec, thanks will play
[06:44:40] <djQuery> remember seeing this in some code somewhere for jqueryui.dialog (i think)
[06:44:48] <R13ose> how come the accordion here: http://development.carinarose.com/projects/hatley-house-ecologite-maison-plaire-chabot/ in the left side below the slideshow works correctly but the accordion here: http://development.carinarose.com/product/green-arrow-plume/ collapses the first paragraph text but not all of it up to Addition Information link in the right side?
[06:47:38] <djQuery> R13ose, both appear to work to me
[06:48:10] <goooogleee> Hello, Ive been at this a couple hours hoping one of you wouldnt mind helping out. Sorry this is jquery related but... http://gristmill.github.io/jquery-popbox/ has a really cool popbox id like to use however ive tried inserting there code and cant seem to get it to respond and appear in the same manor . Im not sure if im uploading the javascript to the correct places and targeting it correctly... sorry i know this is hard to foll
[06:48:32] <goooogleee> im using wordpress.
[06:48:36] <djQuery> R13ose, gues not the one I was looking at on the 2nd page is a tab
[06:49:49] <R13ose> djQuery: right
[06:50:05] <djQuery> R13ose, the mouseout on the text at the bottom is a little ugly, looks like for some reason that part of the page is disabled. some people may not realize that they can interact with that part
[06:50:57] <R13ose> djQuery: okay

Im not sure if im uploading the javascript to the correct places and targeting it correctly... sorry i know this is hard to foll
[06:52:35] <djQuery> goooogleee, its realy hard to follow when you don't mention any errors or give a link or jsfiddle.com and you post you same Q twice in 5 mins
[06:53:36] <R13ose> djQuery: anyway to fix the accordion?
[06:54:04] <goooogleee> I agree ill try to do better from here on when asking questions let me rephrase...
[06:56:22] <goooogleee> Im using a wordpress site , and would like to insert this jQuery PopBox into my wordpress site. my first question is am i supposed to upload popbox.css ,popbox.js , and all the files provided on github to my host or is that not necessary. Im starting back at step #1 since none of my previous steps were successful
[06:56:52] <goooogleee> http://gristmill.github.io/jquery-popbox/ is the site that you can view the popbox at
[06:58:32] <djQuery> goooogleee, lol have you tried adding the data-phychic = true flag?
[06:59:16] <djQuery> goooogleee, sorry to sound like a smart ass but if you don't supply the files to your users how is the page supposed to use the code?
[07:00:01] <djQuery> R13ose, on the 2nd page is the area that is a tab section supposed to be an accordian?
[07:00:52] <R13ose> djQuery: where it says: IRIDESCENT INSPIRATION
[07:00:59] <R13ose> that is the heading for the accordion
[07:01:33] <goooogleee> djQuery: no i understand I know that im a noob lol im working hard to get better.
[07:02:25] <djQuery> R13ose, well it appears that it is applying the ui-accordian css class to all the stuff
[07:02:27] <goooogleee> djQuery: so i have it all uploaded then i paste in the html code from http://gristmill.github.io/jquery-popbox/ and am kind of stuck on what to do with the javascript and all
[07:03:02] <R13ose> djQuery: yes but how come it is messed up?
[07:04:37] <djQuery> R13ose, can you disable jquery ui on the page for a min and let me see it before ui does its thing?
[07:06:42] <R13ose> djQuery: disable jquery ui or accordion?
[07:07:09] <djQuery> R13ose, just comment out the line where it grabs the jqueryui.js file
[07:08:07] <R13ose> djQuery: done
[07:08:10] <djQuery> R13ose, it will probably throw errors all over the place but will let me see the un UIed html I am sure you are just missing a closing tag or something like that
[07:10:34] <djQuery> R13ose, hmmm even disable javascript and its still getting formated
[07:10:52] <R13ose> djQuery: formated?
[07:12:58] <djQuery> R13ose, have you looked at the order that you are loading those files?
[07:13:43] <djQuery> seems you are loading jquery then loading server items that depend on jquery then loading jquery again
[07:14:06] <R13ose> djQuery: yes I have
[07:14:16] <djQuery> just checking
[07:16:13] <djQuery> R13ose, have you tried just comenting out that before activate?
[07:16:23] <djQuery> are you sure that is the same between the 2?
[07:19:45] <djQuery> R13ose, and are you having to do that on each page?
[07:21:14] <djQuery> R13ose, good read here   --> http://ajpiano.com/widgetfactory/#slide1
[07:34:37] <R13ose> djQuery: every page on the individual products within shop
[07:36:34] <djQuery> R13ose, is it different code in the backend that generates the projects versus the code that generates the products?
[07:36:55] <R13ose> djQuery: yes but not different accordion code
[07:46:33] <sergey> I queried page with AJAX, now DOM in variable. How can I get element by ID from variable content?
[07:47:29] <R13ose> djQuery: Are you still researching or have any thoughts?
[07:47:36] <systemfault> sergey: You need to create a fragment from the HTML var fragment = $(theHTML); then you can query the fragment fragment.find(‘#myId’);
[07:47:43] <djQuery> sergey, $(dom).find('#id')
[07:48:55] <sergey> jQuery.parseHTML(loaded).find('#kk-menu-fixed')
[07:48:55] <sergey> TypeError: undefined is not a function
[07:49:36] <sergey> 2nd try
[07:49:36] <sergey> jQuery(loaded).find('#kk-menu-fixed')
[07:49:36] <sergey> []
[07:49:56] <djQuery> sergey, and what is your ajax?
[07:49:57] <systemfault> sergey: parseHTML returns DOM nodes, not a jquery object
[07:49:59] <sergey> but 100% element #kk-menu-fixed exists
[07:50:32] <systemfault> sergey: If you really want to use parseHTML then you need to do: var fragment = $($.parseHTML(loaded)); fragment.find(‘#myid’);
[07:50:34] <decx> might have to use filter instead of find if it's on rootlevel
[07:51:03] <djQuery> var x = jQuery.parseHTML(loaded); $(x).find('#id);

[07:59:38] <WearingMyJimJams> how do i* >.<
[08:01:01] <decx> check if pageX/Y deviates more than a few pixels on mouseup from what they were at mousedown
[08:03:14] <ecky--ptang-zoob> What happens if you use .addClass("foo") and the element already has that class?
[08:03:17] <WearingMyJimJams> is there a way to put that into a $(“body”).on(… format?
[08:06:06] <systemfault> ecky--ptang-zoob: Try it ;)
[08:06:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hmmhesays, good idea
[08:06:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> hmm*
[08:06:39] <djQuery> WearingMyJimJams, you will also need to handle double and triple clicks as those are a way of selecting text
[08:08:48] <WearingMyJimJams> that’s true
[08:11:26] <djQuery> WearingMyJimJams, http://jsbin.com/gabuqace/1/edit
[08:12:10] <djQuery> WearingMyJimJams, still doesn't handle double and triple clicks though
[08:13:00] <djQuery> WearingMyJimJams, wont fire on the 2nd and 3rd click but does fire on the 1st
[08:13:56] <WearingMyJimJams> that is awesome, thanks!
[08:14:02] <R13ose> If I want to replace the main image with thumbnail images on click, how come this code: http://pastebin.com/nMjHQ81z still opens a lightbox instead of replacing?
[08:14:05] <WearingMyJimJams> still fires on 2nd and 3rd click though btw
[08:14:24] <WearingMyJimJams> ah i see what you mean now
[08:14:26] <decx> oh right there is getSelection, nicely done
[08:14:37] <djQuery> WearingMyJimJams, yes google + stackoverflow to the rescue
[08:15:52] <WearingMyJimJams> when you said “2nd and 3rd click”, you didn’t mean double and triple click, did you?
[08:16:15] <djQuery> WearingMyJimJams, yes
[08:16:25] <djQuery> if you double click it will only fire once
[08:16:38] <tomred> Can anyone give me any tips on how I might set the ajax.data after an event? I need to alter the URL depending on what input was used. I am using jquery-ui's autocomplete.
[08:16:40] <djQuery> if you triple click it still only fires once
[08:16:45] <WearingMyJimJams> ah okay, sweet
[08:17:19] <djQuery> WearingMyJimJams, so now you just need to test for a double \ tripple click
[08:17:43] <WearingMyJimJams> and unselect as well
[08:18:14] <djQuery> hmmmm that might be an issue
[08:18:55] <WearingMyJimJams> oh boy
[08:19:21] <djQuery> WearingMyJimJams, who came up with this requirement?
[08:19:36] <WearingMyJimJams> my own damn self i’m afraid
[08:19:58] <djQuery> shhhhhh......
[08:20:06] <WearingMyJimJams> ah well, detecting deselection isn’t that important
[08:20:13] <WearingMyJimJams> this is still gold
[08:21:20] <decx> actually you can cache the selection length, if it changes from >0 to 0 you know that deselection took place
[08:24:54] <R13ose> seems I am getting nowhere
[08:25:13] <dazziola> msg NickServ realex-darragh
[08:25:38] <dazziola> Hey, I'm having a bit of an issue with the hover event with Chrome
[08:26:11] <decx> and?
[08:26:23] <dazziola> It seems as though if the element is hovered upon directly from an element outside the viewport (eg. the address bar area) Chrome will fire the Jquery event 3 times
[08:26:36] <dazziola> eg. MouseOver MouseOut MouseOver
[08:26:52] <dazziola> No such issue is replicated in IE or Firefox
[08:27:09] <dazziola> I've disabled event propagation
[08:27:12] <decx> fiddle up
[08:27:17] <dazziola> will do
[08:28:03] <WearingMyJimJams> i did it!
[08:28:05] <randomDude000> dazziola: mouseenter instead of mouseover might do the trick
[08:28:20] <djQuery_> got disconnected damit
[08:28:30] <djQuery_> WearingMyJimJams, show me please
[08:29:02] <WearingMyJimJams> http://jsbin.com/gabuqace/2/edit
[08:29:14] <WearingMyJimJams> not the double or triple clicks, but the deselection
[08:30:11] <dazziola> randomDude000: Ideally I'd prefer to have the one hover() event controlling the action rather than two mouseover and mouseout events you know what i mean?
[08:30:40] <WearingMyJimJams> cached the old selection like decx said
[08:31:04] <dazziola> http://jsfiddle.net/z2DLg/1/
[08:31:34] <djQuery_> WearingMyJimJams, https://github.com/GerHobbelt/jquery-fixclick/blob/master/jquery-fixclick.js
[08:31:48] <WearingMyJimJams> interestingly, if you double or triple click really fast, it selects the text and doesn’t fire, like i wanted
[08:32:04] <dazziola> In Chrome the fiddle works fine as the mouse is coming from within other DOM elements already
[08:32:15] <WearingMyJimJams> but if you do it just at moderate speed, it still registers as a normal click but still selects the text
[08:32:56] <dazziola> it's when the element (#leftHotspot in this case) is visited by the mouse as soon as the mouse enters the viewport (eg. the very first pixel along the top)
[08:33:09] <djQuery_> WearingMyJimJams, yes it doesn't fire when you unselect but it is also not firing when you click again after that
[08:33:53] <WearingMyJimJams> djQuery_ it does fire
[08:34:29] <WearingMyJimJams> if you mean after selection and unselection
[08:34:39] <djQuery_> WearingMyJimJams, double click to select it, single click to unselect it,  click it again
[08:34:59] <WearingMyJimJams> it works
[08:35:06] <WearingMyJimJams> hmm
[08:35:49] <R13ose> djQuery_: any thought on my other question?
[08:36:41] <djQuery_> R13ose, sorry outa ideas on the accordian thing
[08:37:10] <dazziola> R13ose: What's your issue re: an accordian?
[08:37:20] <djQuery_> R13ose, was disconnected for a little while so if you had another Q I mighta missed it
[08:38:08] <R13ose> dazziola: that on one page it is working correctly but on the other it is not, and same code being used.
[08:40:41] <dazziola> http://fiddle.jshell.net/z2DLg/1/show/ - just the raw fiddle output for those who may be able to help with this seemingly chrome only issue - entering the left hotspot from the above toolbar rather than another DOM element seems to make Chrome fire event 3 times
[08:40:52] <R13ose> djQuery_: you were here for sure when I asked this second question
[08:41:28] <dazziola> What event is triggering the accordian R13ose?
[08:41:49] <R13ose> dazziola: are you on the page?
[08:41:59] <dazziola> no? I don't have a link?
[08:42:46] <R13ose> Working: http://development.carinarose.com/projects/hatley-house-ecologite-maison-plaire-chabot/ in the left side below the slideshow works correctly. Not Working http://development.carinarose.com/product/green-arrow-plume/ collapses the first paragraph text but not all of it up to Addition Information link in the right side?
[08:43:09] <R13ose> If I want to replace the main image with thumbnail images on click, how come this code: http://pastebin.com/nMjHQ81z still opens a lightbox instead of replacing?
[08:43:14] <R13ose> djQuery_: ^
[08:45:29] <djQuery_> R13ose, because somewhere else on the page you have a light box that allready registered an onclick handler ?
[08:47:43] <R13ose> djQuery_: only thing is click is the accordion and the replace images.  The a tag does have rel="lightbox[]"
[08:48:39] <djQuery_> R13ose, http://pastebin.com/ZfWWJXjq
[08:49:35] <djQuery_> R13ose, seems like lightbox is automagicaly picking up the a and binding a click handler to it
[08:50:02] <R13ose> djQuery_: then your code will not work either?
[08:50:44] <djQuery_> R13ose, it depends on where lightbox is attaching its click handler, if its attaching it to the item itself then it will work
[08:51:06] <djQuery_> if it is say attaching it to the parent item or the document then it wont
[08:52:27] <djQuery_> this might help with the 2nd scenario http://pastebin.com/LcUAevmv
[08:53:03] <djQuery_> then again you could probably just remove the rel="lightbox[]" and not have to apply my hack
[08:55:04] <djQuery_> wow its been awhile but have they stopped the #jquery-ui channel?
[08:55:12] <djQuery_> I am the only one there lol
[08:55:27] <R13ose> there are 9 people there
[08:55:37] <duch_kazatel> weird.  should be more folks.
[08:56:10] <djQuery_> dang software
[08:56:44] <R13ose> djQuery_: your code is still not working
[08:57:06] <djQuery_> R13ose, then again you could probably just remove the rel="lightbox[]" and not have to apply my hack
[08:57:25] <dazziola> Anyone any ideas regarding jQuery firing more than once per event?
[08:57:38] <RandalSchwartz> heh... that's about what I was going to ask here. :)
[08:57:50] <RandalSchwartz> my problem is that I need to conditionally execute .on()
[08:58:01] <djQuery_> dazziola, RandalSchwartz is something bubbling?
[08:58:09] <dazziola> http://fiddle.jshell.net/z2DLg/1/show/ - if one enters their mouse from the top (eg. at exactly >1px in)
[08:58:12] <RandalSchwartz> seems I'm pulling in the same event trigger for multiple tabs
[08:58:20] <RandalSchwartz> and so it's getting .on() by each tab
[08:58:22] <dazziola> I've prevented event propagation and still get issues
[08:58:26] <dazziola> see link above
[08:58:41] <RandalSchwartz> I need to ask jquery if there's already a click handler, and if so, don't apply it again.
[08:58:47] <RandalSchwartz> .on('click' ... )
[08:58:48] <dazziola> it happens when mouse enters from outside of the viewport
[08:58:55] <djQuery_> dazziola, see ?stop
[08:59:07] <dazziola> eg from address bar -> DOM element
[08:59:09] <djQuery_> gues they dont have bots here anymore
[08:59:26] <duch_kazatel> SURE THEY DP.
[08:59:31] <duch_kazatel> *sure they do
[08:59:35] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery on
[08:59:36] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[08:59:52] <djQuery_> !stop@dazziola
[09:00:01] <duch_kazatel> !stop
[09:00:09] <RandalSchwartz> I guess I could .off() and .on() it
[09:00:12] <duch_kazatel> looks like this one doesn't have that commant.
[09:00:22] <duch_kazatel> RandalSchwartz wrap your handler logic instead.
[09:00:32] <duch_kazatel> RandalSchwartz don't add and remove bindings like that if you can avoid it.
[09:00:34] <djQuery_> dazziola, http://api.jquery.com/stop/    try stoping before doing your animation
[09:02:03] <dazziola> That works to a degree (very jumpy elements on initial event) and judging by my console output, the event is still getting fired 3 times
[09:02:14] <dazziola> appreciating all the help though!
[09:02:31] <duch_kazatel> dazziola that means you're binding multiple times
[09:02:35] <duch_kazatel> dazziola have a fiddle?
[09:02:39] <djQuery_> RandalSchwartz, that are ligitimate ways that it could have more than 1 click handler, also you may not find the click handler if someone is doings something like  $(document).on('a', 'click', function(){});
[09:02:51] <dazziola> http://jsfiddle.net/z2DLg/1/
[09:03:08] <dazziola> the issue can't be replicated in the fiddle alone, so I've extracted the output iframe
[09:03:10] <dazziola> http://fiddle.jshell.net/z2DLg/1/show/
[09:03:52] <dazziola> if you enter the leftmost 25% (the hotspot) from the toolbar/address bar it will cause the event to fire three time (mouseOn mouseOut mouseOn)
[09:04:08] <djQuery_> dazziola, $('#slideContainer').stop().toggleClass('leftHover', 500);
[09:04:09] <duch_kazatel> interesting.
[09:04:13] <djQuery_> that help?
[09:04:22] <dazziola> if however you enter the hotspot from the very right, the animation runs perfectlky
[09:04:42] <duch_kazatel> dazziola have you considered not using .hover?
[09:04:56] <R13ose> djQuery_: I can't find where that is
[09:04:58] <dazziola> I have, it happens even with individual mouseOn/Out events
[09:05:11] <duch_kazatel> what about mouseenter
[09:05:38] <dazziola> djQuery_ that bricks the whole animation (!) but doesn't prevent the console output, which is still firing the 3 events
[09:05:48] <RandalSchwartz> weird.
[09:06:00] <RandalSchwartz> got disconnected, then it said "invalid password for jtrucks"
[09:06:07] <RandalSchwartz> I wonder if I just got hacked
[09:07:00] <dazziola> duch_kazatel: with mouseenter the animation just goes out and back
[09:07:08] <dazziola> hover it goes out back out
[09:07:15] <mrits> anyone know how to skip a column for jquery sortable? I had an ID column that is not part of the list I want to sort.
[09:07:30] <dazziola> Bit bizarre how it only behaves this way in Chrome
[09:07:38] <dazziola> It even works in IE9!
[09:08:14] <Jattenalle> dazziola, i was just about to say it works fine in firefox
[09:08:38] <dazziola> Yeah, thanks Jattenalle, that makes it all the more baffling
[09:08:46] <dazziola> The logs in Firefox are perfect
[09:09:03] <dazziola> Just the one event being fire
[09:09:05] <dazziola> fired*
[09:10:04] <BillCriswell> I love reading through CSS class names and just seeing the absolute collapse of hope of them making sense.
[09:10:20] <BillCriswell> .home-left-middle-right {}
[09:10:27] <Jattenalle> :P
[09:11:03] <dazziola> BillCriswell - it all starts off with all good intentions: camel case, understandable naming conventions...then the nesting begins!
[09:11:19] <dazziola> hyphens appear where you never intended hyphens to appear!
[09:11:56] <BillCriswell> dazziola: Haha absolutely.
[09:11:59] <djQuery_> dazziola, I cant find the left hover in the css window?
[09:12:40] <djQuery_> dazziola, found it #slideContainer.leftHover
[09:12:52] <dazziola> yup!
[09:14:10] <djQuery_> dazziola, basicaly stop() was to stop the animation if people mover their mouse over the item several times before the animation finishes so that it wont be queued up
[09:14:24] <RandalSchwartz> not sure how to solve this without .off() and .on() on each pass
[09:14:28] <MikeD_> does .autocomplete() overwrite .on('keyup'...) ?
[09:14:34] <djQuery_> notice that without the stop if you move you mouse quickly the animation continues for a while
[09:15:04] <dazziola> Yeah I was going to address by toggling an active class while the section was hovered/active
[09:15:11] <dazziola> but stop might work better in that case!
[09:15:51] <dazziola> right all, I must get off this
[09:15:58] <dazziola> thanks for all the help
[09:16:02] <dazziola> no doubt I will be back tomorrow
[09:16:38] <dazziola> Have a good one everybody
[09:16:49] <mad_hatter> hey folks, so I have a div, that contains dynamically generated content, and quite a bit of it. Is there a way that I can only 'show' the first 5 iterations of the loop and then have a button that says something like 'show all' that then expands the div to show all of it's content?
[09:18:51] <MikeD_> mad_hatter: of course
[09:19:31] <MikeD_> you could have the button toggle an expand/collapse classname on the parent, then decide what that means/how it presents via css
[09:20:17] <mad_hatter> well It's not pure html
[09:20:19] <duch_kazatel> i feel like i had a rough weekend, but I really didn;t.
[09:20:37] <MikeD_> you want a pure html solution meaning no javascript?
[09:21:26] <mad_hatter> no no h/o imma paste what i have
[09:21:33] <MikeD_> jsfiddle.net
[09:22:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does anyone know how to make a filter with a function AND a classfilter in isotope? http://isotope.metafizzy.co/filtering.html - the multiple filter example only works with class filters and the function filter is only 1 filter. I have a class filter and  a function filter, how to apply both?
[09:23:02] <mad_hatter> MikeD_, http://scsys.co.uk:8002/paste
[09:23:31] <MikeD_> it's empty
[09:23:57] <mad_hatter> http://scsys.co.uk:8002/400131
[09:23:59] <mad_hatter> my bad
[09:24:01] <mad_hatter> ^^
[09:24:56] <MikeD_> k, so what are you trying to accomplish?
[09:25:29] <djQuery_> ecky--ptang-zoob, looks like you going to have to do it all in the filter function or not at all
[09:26:14] <djQuery_> ecky--ptang-zoob, you just need to have more than 1 condition in you function
[09:26:14] <mad_hatter> That dumps a whole crap of data into that div that drops the page down...so in the 'foreach my $key (sort %{$today_feed}) { loop I only want it to show on the page the first five iterations
[09:26:42] <mad_hatter> and then add a button that has something like 'show all' that if the user clicks on shows all of what is in the div
[09:27:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> DjQuery_: found a way already. http://codepen.io/desandro/pen/owAyG/
[09:28:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I just don't understand this line: for ( var prop in filters ) - I don't see anywhere where "filters" is defined
[09:28:53] <MikeD_> mad_hatter: is that code running serverside?
[09:29:09] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob that object is probably created by isotope
[09:29:30] <mad_hatter> yes, it's a a template generated by Mojolicious (perl web framework)
[09:30:04] <MikeD_> so are you trying to change the behavior of the serverside code or do something in the browser?
[09:30:21] <mad_hatter> I'd like it to be done client side
[09:30:30] <mad_hatter> I don't really want to mess with the server side code too much
[09:31:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> oh
[09:31:44] <MikeD_> so if you had a style like #today_feeds { height: 100px; overflow: hidden; }  <-- no matter how much content went into that div, it'd be 100px high.
[09:31:58] <mad_hatter> gotcha
[09:32:02] <MikeD_> #today_feeds.showall { height: auto; }
[09:32:22] <MikeD_> or if you don't have the means to change the classname like that..
[09:32:23] <djQuery_> ecky--ptang-zoob, look at line 58 of the javascript
[09:33:05] <MikeD_> input.checked + #today_feeds {}  and put a label for that input "show all" and place the input before the feeds div
[09:33:19] <MikeD_> you could even hide the check via css if you didn't want to see it
[09:33:26] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Okaria, so that example uses 2 functions. But how to combine a class filter and a function filter?
[09:34:55] <R13ose> afk
[09:36:15] <Rob__> Hey peepz, im having some trouble with Wrap(), it does not give the expected result. i try    wrapping mainDiv around another Div, and then wrap the result onto another div, but then im missing the first wrap (mainDiv) a jsfiddle here; http://jsfiddle.net/RXGN9/
[09:36:59] <Rob__> im console.logging the results of each wrap. You can follow it on more detail there.
[09:39:12] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: you're not changing the dom at all
[09:39:28] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: you're wrapping jquery objects with other jquery objects
[09:39:35] <Rob__> yeah, shouldn't that be possible ?
[09:40:10] <Rob__> why would it work the first time, and not the second time, i thought jQuery creates DOMElements once a HTML String is passed through a jquery selector anyway.
[09:41:30] <ryanneufeld> it should
[09:41:39] <absolutezeroff> Hey, what does this refer to in http://pastie.org/9317150
[09:41:41] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[09:41:42] <Rob__> Yeah, so technically it should work ?
[09:41:44] <ryanneufeld> I'm looking at it Rob__
[09:41:45] <absolutezeroff> er *'this'
[09:41:51] <duch_kazatel> absolutezeroff the clicked element
[09:41:55] <absolutezeroff> aight thanks
[09:43:26] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: what makes you say it's working?
[09:43:46] <Rob__> Hm? Im not saying its working? It doesn't :P
[09:44:08] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: your comment "(all ok)"
[09:44:39] <Rob__> But i thought $(passing html) -> creates a reference to a created element on runtime -> using that object in the wrap( param ) to merge that reference to another reference -> Shouldn't it pass back a new reference with the combined objects?
[09:44:51] <Rob__> oh, yeah. Because it has both Elements showing in Console.log
[09:45:11] <Rob__> the first wrap returns expected html structure
[09:45:21] <duch_kazatel> "This method returns the original set of elements for chaining purposes."
[09:45:22] <Rob__> the second, removes the "mainWrap"
[09:45:46] <Rob__> duch; you mean to say, it doesn't return a reference to a newly created object?
[09:45:54] <duch_kazatel> Rob__ i'm quoting the docs.
[09:46:23] <Rob__> yeah, but asume you pasting it here (Which i thank you for.) You also know what its meaning is.
[09:46:40] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: it's common for jquery methods to return the original data set (albeit modified by your method calls)
[09:46:54] <Rob__> "Original set of elements" shouldn't it then return all three original elements with their references?
[09:47:03] <ryanneufeld> so you can do $(thing).addClass().addClass().show()
[09:47:11] <Rob__> ah right.
[09:47:33] <Rob__> hmm, so i have to initiate a copy of it, each time i wrap ?
[09:47:44] <Rob__> creating a new object manually out of the wrapped element
[09:47:53] <Rob__> Its hard keeping references to the elements then.. damn
[09:48:32] <duch_kazatel> there's something funky afoot.
[09:49:02] <djQuery_> hmmm no iteration of this works either var test = $('<h3 class="mainWrap">MainWrap</h3>')
[09:49:02] <djQuery_>     .wrap('h2').wrap('h1').appendTo('body');
[09:49:47] <Rob__> is there a way to search a html structure with a jquery object.. What i'd ideally like to see -> var test = $('htmlstring') returns jQuery object with htmlstring reference -> htmlstring that has the same div with same classes etc -> .find( test ) -> should return the elements that are equal to that one
[09:50:44] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: you can do that, but it's really slow
[09:51:04] <ryanneufeld> Depending on what you want to search for
[09:51:09] <Rob__> okay.. and how? It doesn't matter that its slow, its only used in a initialization process.. So wether it takes a few seconds longer is not a problem.
[09:51:24] <ryanneufeld> it's in the docs under selectors
[09:51:29] <inv3nt0r> Good afternoon everyone
[09:51:50] <inv3nt0r> Can someone tell me if the .css() method allows me to change -webkit-filter properties?
[09:52:10] <inv3nt0r> I want to remove: -webkit-filter: blur(10px) !important; from an element
[09:52:30] <Rob__> ah, i see. yeah it seems to be possible. stupid me.... Was looking at parent() not .find()
[09:52:42] <inv3nt0r> Tried jQuery('.classname').css('-webkit-filter', 'none'); to no avail... somethign I'm doing wrong here?
[09:53:29] <djQuery_> inv3nt0r, !demo
[09:53:30] <Rob__> inv3nt0r: i think you need to set the original element filter and not with a -prefix-
[09:53:55] <djQuery_> ?demo
[09:53:55] <b-ot> djQuery_: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[09:54:14] <djQuery_> inv3nt0r, could you set up a ?demo
[09:54:42] <ryanneufeld> inv3nt0r: you need to do "none !important"
[09:54:54] <ryanneufeld> since the !important will override whatever else you set it to
[09:55:22] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: I figured out why you're not getting the results you expected
[09:55:22] <inv3nt0r> I got it by using .attr('style')
[09:55:24] <inv3nt0r> Thanks though
[09:55:32] <Rob__> Which is :o
[09:55:42] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: I'm updating the fiddle to illustrate
[09:55:50] <Rob__> alright thank you =)
[10:03:09] <Rob__> a big chunk of code, or alot of comment =p ?
[10:03:19] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: http://jsfiddle.net/RXGN9/1/
[10:03:31] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: in short, you're doing it backwards
[10:03:54] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: if you want to wrap them in the order you're doing it, you should be using append instead
[10:04:16] <Rob__> ehh =p
[10:04:19] <Rob__> yeah.. Append
[10:04:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> djQuery_: do you understand this filter = filterFns[ filter ] || filter; => why does he use a class filter as a key for a function filter?
[10:04:46] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: http://jsfiddle.net/RXGN9/2/
[10:05:01] <djQuery_> ecky--ptang-zoob, yes I understand it just don't know how to explain it
[10:05:07] <Rob__> yep. I see
[10:05:16] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: that one gives you the same results, with minimal changes, I don't fully know what you're trying to do here
[10:05:28] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: but hopefully that sheds some light on the problem for you
[10:05:30] <ecky--ptang-zoob> in my case it just sets all filter to .popular in the whole loop
[10:05:31] <Rob__> the append version is going the wrong way for the structure im using tho.
[10:05:34] <Rob__> yep :) thank you very much
[10:05:47] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: no it's not
[10:06:00] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: not based on how your wrap code was written
[10:06:22] <Rob__> the wrap code i wrote, is a chain that occurs after some function calls in the main system .
[10:06:37] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: the way your wraps were written this is the result you appeared to be expecting
[10:06:40] <ecky--ptang-zoob> he loops over the prop filters and then for some reason he used that as a key
[10:06:50] <Rob__> if i append it instead of wrapping it, the way i expected it "could" i would have to do it in reverse order
[10:07:04] <djQuery_> ecky--ptang-zoob, take a look at the html of those buttons
[10:07:21] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: I could help you further if you had an example of the structure you were attempting to build
[10:07:45] <djQuery_> ecky--ptang-zoob, theoretically he could 50 more colors and wouldn't have to change his code
[10:08:04] <Rob__> Nah thats okay, :) i can think of something now since you provided me with the correct response of wrap()
[10:08:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yes I get that part, I don't understand that test I just pasted
[10:08:26] <Rob__> Im a developer so^^ So solving some unexpected occurences is part of the bundle right^^
[10:08:49] <Rob__> you've helped me a great deal to showing me how Wrap actually does its work.
[10:09:20] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: glad I could help
[10:09:27] <Rob__> :)
[10:11:48] <jangoh> Need help from d3 experts http://dpaste.com/19RZC3M
[10:13:33] <Rob__> ryanneufeld: Object.create(jQueryObject) creates a new object with a cloned version of jQueryObject as base, but when i manipulate the dom of the copied jquery obejct the other object will contain the same html structure (I asume because even though both objects are not one and the same they still have the same reference to a specific element right? )
[10:14:17] <ryanneufeld> ?api clone
[10:14:18] <b-ot> ryanneufeld: .clone(): Create a deep copy of the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/clone/
[10:14:33] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: what is it you're trying to do?
[10:16:35] <Rob__> Ehm let me think on how i could answer that. Technically im trying to create a drag and drop system, which i can add elements through a add function. I want to keep a loose reference to EVERY object that might needs to be changed by  a config function later on once its dragged and dropped in. But therefore i need to be able to append and wrap elements like this, since i want to '.find()' elements using dynamic classes and ids, not ma
[10:16:36] <Rob__> sense*
[10:16:50] <salt_> I am trying to do an AJAX get call, and use the data on response to update the UI and I am having async issues
[10:17:03] <duch_kazatel> salt_ put your update logic in the .done() callback.
[10:17:33] <salt_> duch_kazatel: that was quick, thanks!
[10:17:52] <duch_kazatel> sure
[10:18:08] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: as long as the elements are in the dom, you can give them a unique ID and just store an array of them
[10:18:15] <ryanneufeld> might be a tighter data structure
[10:18:20] <salt_> duch_kazatel: so as a tester I am doing this https://gist.github.com/saltandbeer/a270be86bd1ade9f847b and I get nothing
[10:19:06] <Rob__> yep, i was thinking about something like that too, but i'd have to be unique ids, and since draggable clones an element, but contains a original version of it its hard using ids. Since they can't be unique once cloned..
[10:19:40] <duch_kazatel> salt_ http://jsfiddle.net/N5QJ4/
[10:19:42] <duch_kazatel> then do that
[10:19:49] <duch_kazatel> or use $.ajax() instead.
[10:24:58] <salt_> hmmm still doesn't work
[10:25:01] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: I solved that problem once
[10:25:14] <duch_kazatel> salt_ check your network panel - is the request succeeding?
[10:25:16] <gooddesignusa> is there a way to check if the version of jquery that is use supports .on() or should i just check the version of jquery?
[10:25:49] <duch_kazatel> gooddesignusa what version are you using?
[10:25:52] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/ that might help you out.
[10:26:40] <salt_> yep, im getting 200's
[10:27:02] <gooddesignusa> The reason I ask is i'm using drupal and it includes a different version of jquery depending on if you are in the admin area. A jquery plugin i'm using is using .on which works fine on normal non-admin pages but breaks on admin pages b/c its using an older version. I wanted to change the plugin so it checks for .on support. I've been googling around but couldn't find anything. Looks like the only way is to check the jquer
[10:27:40] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: maybe not, but if you use jquery ui's draggables etc, there are ways to maintain a link to the original object
[10:27:45] <duch_kazatel> salt_ try using $.ajax() and the .always() callback - that kind of problem usually means you've got an error in the data coming back.
[10:27:48] <Rob__> yeah, i am :)
[10:28:14] <Rob__> i very humbly thank you for taking your time to write that, but i already knew about most of it. :x
[10:28:19] <ryanneufeld> gooddesignusa: if (typeof jQuery.on == "function")
[10:28:39] <Rob__> ill experiment around with it ^^
[10:28:47] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: I wrote it a long time ago for myself, I just share it when it seems relevant :p
[10:28:57] <Rob__> haha =p okay =)
[10:28:57] <gooddesignusa> returns undefined. I guess I can check if jQuery.fn.on is not empty
[10:29:08] <duch_kazatel> gooddesignusa or check the typeof.
[10:29:33] <ryanneufeld> Rob__: the fact that it's using jquery 1.7.1 should be a hint :p
[10:29:45] <Rob__> i didn't look at that :x shame on me
[10:29:58] <ryanneufeld> gooddesignusa: if (typeof jQuery.fn.on == "function")
[10:30:05] <salt_> duch_kazatel: heck yes - that works!  thank you so much!
[10:30:10] <duch_kazatel> salt_ wait.
[10:30:18] <duch_kazatel> salt_ that means you need to fix your data.
[10:30:33] <gooddesignusa> it ended up being typeof jQuery.fn.on
[10:30:34] <duch_kazatel> what does your data look like?
[10:30:36] <salt_> It's on a shopify site, not really an option
[10:30:36] <gooddesignusa> thanks guys
[10:30:53] <duch_kazatel> salt_ what are you trying to get then?
[10:31:28] <salt_> i need to update the cart modal on adding something to it
[10:31:44] <inv3nt0r> Another quick question.... does anyone know how to prevent a bookmarklet form reirecting after clicking
[10:31:53] <inv3nt0r> Doesn't seem to do it in chrome, but does in firefox
[10:32:30] <duch_kazatel> salt_ not sure what that means, but you should read the $.ajax() docs and make sure you have everything configured correctly on your end.  you shouldn't rely on .always() the way you're about to.
[10:33:50] <salt_> duch_kazatel: is there security risks?  I am getting everything I need for my UI update fine, and I really have no control over the API response
[10:35:12] <duch_kazatel> salt_ always() runs, well, always.  that can make your code confusing.  you should use a properly configured request with .done() instead of relying on .always(), that way when an error occurs, you don't wind up with funky after-effects.
[10:46:40] <ryanneufeld> inv3nt0r: return false;
[10:55:45] <rogerpfaff> hi all. anybody here has experience with superfish menus? I need a hint where to avoid closing of submenus when I click outside of the menu
[10:58:31] <decx> i have experience in that it's built into oxid shop and i hate it so much that i get rid of it everytime
[10:59:12] <gooddesignusa> is there a way to detect if :after is supported. Since IE8 sucks
[11:00:20] <decx> just check if it's ie8 and less
[11:00:32] <duch_kazatel> or use moderizr
[11:00:34] <rogerpfaff> decx: you mean superfish in general or just this functionality?
[11:00:39] <duch_kazatel> *modernizr
[11:00:49] <decx> i mean superfish in general
[11:01:05] <duch_kazatel> though IE8 DOES support :after
[11:01:13] <duch_kazatel> with a caveat
[11:01:18] <decx> z-index
[11:01:22] <duch_kazatel> yep
[11:01:22] <gooddesignusa> I know I can use moderizr but I didn't want to include it just for 1 check.
[11:01:47] <gooddesignusa> I only need to support back to IE 8. If I could get :after to work than no need for js :)
[11:01:57] <decx> you need a shim for html5 tags anyway
[11:02:00] <duch_kazatel> :after z-index you mean?
[11:02:05] <decx> might as well use modernizr
[11:02:57] <gooddesignusa> decx: the theme I'm using for drupal already has some html shim I think. I'm almost done with this project and just fighting IE8. In my css I was using p:last-child:after{ content:"\201D"; } to show right quotes around some text
[11:03:43] <duch_kazatel> gooddesignusa :last-child is your problem there.
[11:04:29] <gooddesignusa> ah ok ;)
[11:04:51] <decx> right thats ie9 uurc
[11:04:54] <decx> iirc
[11:05:00] <goooogleee> woot!
[11:06:19] <gooddesignusa> duch_kazatel: yeah looks like my theme was adding http://html5shiv.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js for [lt IE 9]
[11:07:18] <gooddesignusa> ok thanks for the help
[11:20:00] <Es0teric> hi everyone
[11:20:16] <RandalSchwartz> hello!
[11:20:28] <RandalSchwartz> what age were you when you picked Es0teric
[11:20:34] * RandalSchwartz is just doing a survey
[11:20:41] <Es0teric> picked for what?
[11:20:43] <Es0teric> RandalSchwartz:
[11:21:06] <RandalSchwartz> well - you're still using it... so when did you start?  What age?
[11:22:52] <duch_kazatel> picked the username, you mean?
[11:23:13] <decx> what kind of question is that
[11:23:30] <duch_kazatel> kind of a weird one imo.
[11:23:32] <decx> there's neither xx_ _xx nor 420 in the name so what's the deal ^^
[11:24:31] <duch_kazatel> ~*xXx_HaRdCoRe_420_b0nGzIlLa_xXx*~
[11:24:56] <RandalSchwartz> yeah, just trying to figure out when people pick 31337 names
[11:25:07] <RandalSchwartz> typically, it's age 14-17
[11:25:24] <decx> just because you're real naming doesnt mean you have to be smug about it ;)
[11:25:36] <duch_kazatel> :D
[11:28:30] <RandalSchwartz> well - just surveying
[11:28:40] <RandalSchwartz> to reconfirm my observation that it's about 14-17
[11:28:46] <RandalSchwartz> even if they're 30 now :)
[11:29:02] <Es0teric> RandalSchwartz: 15
[11:29:07] <Es0teric> i am 26 now
[11:29:12] <RandalSchwartz> and see!
[11:29:14] <RandalSchwartz> another data point
[11:29:33] <RandalSchwartz> Nobody selects 31337 names after the age of 17
[11:29:45] <MikeD_> RandalSchwartz:  what age were you when you saw SpaceBalls ?  :p
[11:29:55] <RandalSchwartz> when it was in theatre
[11:29:59] <RandalSchwartz> do you need me to look that up?
[11:30:23] <RandalSchwartz> 1987 - so ... 26
[11:30:51] <RandalSchwartz> maybe 25... because it was likely out before november
[11:31:24] <MikeD_> What age were you when you saw Monsters Inc?
[11:31:44] <RandalSchwartz> Yeah... that has one-l Randal too
[11:31:50] <RandalSchwartz> do you have a point here? :)
[11:32:00] <MikeD_> no, just doing a survey
[11:32:21] <RandalSchwartz> what age were you at your first consumption of bacon?
[11:32:44] <MikeD_> see, you could have gone Beastie Boys with a nick like "MikeD"  (everyone else does)
[11:33:24] <decx> i picked decx because .de.cx domains were free in the 90s
[11:33:29] <RandalSchwartz> I actually don't recall how they are related
[11:33:47] <inv3nt0r> ryanneufeld: Thanks... I'll give that a try
[11:36:13] <inv3nt0r> ryanneufeld: With return false; the javascript doesn't fire at all...
[11:37:15] <inv3nt0r> ryanneufeld: Oops... because I didn't have everything wrapped in a function LOL
[11:37:27] <ryanneufeld> there you go
[11:44:35] <Es0teric> if i am dynamically adding elements via $(‘’<div/>, {class: “someclass”}); on an ajax call, and i want to remove that same element on another ajax call what would be the most effective way to remove it?
[11:44:52] <duch_kazatel> by giving it a unique ID and targeting that.
[11:45:13] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel but i already gave them a class
[11:45:22] <Es0teric> that should be good enough
[11:45:26] <duch_kazatel> do you want to remove all of them with that class?
[11:45:42] <Es0teric> well it would only be one class per element
[11:45:45] <Es0teric> its a unique class
[11:45:52] <duch_kazatel> use IDs instead of they're unique.
[11:45:58] <duch_kazatel> classes are meant for groups on things.
[11:46:09] <duch_kazatel> either way just target that class.
[11:46:18] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel yes i know but right now theres already css styles being applied to them so changing them to ID’s are not an option
[11:46:47] <duch_kazatel> why can't you just target the class then and remove that way?
[11:47:05] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i will try it… so its $(’.someClass’).remove()
[11:47:08] <Es0teric> right?
[11:47:26] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery remove
[11:47:28] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .remove() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/remove/
[11:47:35] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[11:47:36] <Es0teric> thats what i just said =_=
[11:48:09] <duch_kazatel> the docs tell you the syntax - not sure why you're asking me :)
[11:49:15] <Es0teric> oh, duch_kazatel also i can check for the existence of a div by doing $(‘#someID’).length right?
[11:49:18] <Es0teric> if its 1 it exists?
[11:49:32] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[11:49:36] <Es0teric> alright alright cool
[11:49:39] <Es0teric> i have an idea then
[11:49:57] <duch_kazatel> or just checkout .length - no need to verify length if it's an if check.
[11:50:10] <duch_kazatel> also most of that time that check is implied.
[12:20:18] <Es0teric> ok so how do i make an element remove on every request? not remove all in one request?
[12:20:53] <djQuery> Es0teric, little more detail?
[12:21:53] <Es0teric> djQuery: if its an ajax request, i want to remove elements every time a remove action is clicked… right now i have something in the success ajax like… $(‘.element1’).remove(); $(‘’.element2).remove();
[12:22:12] <Es0teric> but i want to seperate them on every request
[12:24:42] <djQuery> Es0teric, so I am imagining a table with rows of data? each row has a delete button? click on delete row gets deleted via ajax then row removed from table?
[12:25:00] <jjjjjosh> i'm having trouble getting file uploads with jquery to work. i'm setting contentType and processData to false, and can see on the server that it has the correct content-type header
[12:25:06] <Es0teric> djQuery: yes that is a very similar situation
[12:25:21] <jjjjjosh> ...but no files apparently?
[12:26:23] <djQuery> Es0teric, so what you need is the context of the row + the row id
[12:28:06] <djQuery> Es0teric, look at the context option of ajax
[12:28:49] <djQuery> Es0teric, hmm not sure
[12:29:06] <GnuBoi> On this page https://api.jquery.com/jquery.post/ how would I "Alert the results from requesting test.php (HTML or XML, depending on what was returned) and and send some additional data along"? sending json and also having handling function is not document? how is it done?
[12:32:43] <Es0teric> djQuery yeah.. its already doing something major so....
[12:33:11] <DeltaHeavy> I want a click, and a touch event on the same element. I however don't want the touch event to ALSO trigger the click event. How can I do this?
[12:33:14] <djQuery> $('table tr.datarow').on('deleteRow', function(){    id=this.id; $.ajax({url: "delete.php", data: {row: id}).done($(this.remove();)});   $('.deletebutton').on('click', function(){ $(this).parent('.datarow').trigger('deleteRow');});
[12:33:31] <djQuery> Es0teric, something like that off the top of my head
[12:35:38] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6235794/jquery-mobile-for-every-live-tap-event-should-there-be-an-equivalent-click-even
[12:36:18] <themiddleman> I'm looking for a fullscreen photo slider plugin that is mobile friendly, any recommendations?
[12:36:39] <richurd> hello, what does this error mean ? "Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function"
[12:37:05] <duch_kazatel> richurd usually that you tried to call a method on something that isn't a jquery object.
[12:37:35] <systemfault> richardbaker: You have a variable that is undefined… and you try to call it like a function
[12:37:36] <DeltaHeavy> djQuery: I'm not using jQ mobile. I'm using jQ 2.x
[12:37:50] <richurd> aha so how should i fix it
[12:38:16] <djQuery> ?phsycic
[12:38:18] <duch_kazatel> richurd do you have the line of codeit's erroring on?
[12:38:23] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ richurd
[12:38:23] <b-ot> richurd: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[12:38:59] <d0liver> Anyone know of a good multi-page form solution with jquery? I'm looking for something that will keep me from having to pass around state information in php over the course of a multi page form.
[12:39:01] <richurd> its a wordpress plugin sigh
[12:39:05] <DeltaHeavy> djQuery: I thought nobody reasonably used jQ mobile :p
[12:39:23] <AlexKvazos> d0liver
[12:39:28] <duch_kazatel> richurd then make sure what you're passing it was you think it is.
[12:39:30] <AlexKvazos> simply make multiple div containers, one for each page
[12:39:31] <BillCriswell> I never realized how much I love :nth-child till today.
[12:39:32] <timgauthier> ugh wordpress sucks, see if you can find something better to use ;)
[12:39:49] <AlexKvazos> give them absolute positoning, 100% width and height, and top/left 0
[12:40:00] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, then look at the other answer on the same post
[12:40:15] <BillCriswell> The people I meet using wordpress seem to mostly be in it for the plugins.
[12:40:16] <richurd> am not passing anything, thats the weird thing
[12:40:47] <duch_kazatel> richurd then go talk to the people who made the plugin.
[12:40:52] <duch_kazatel> or show us the problem.
[12:41:09] <DeltaHeavy> djQuery: I'm not sure any of that relates to what I want. I want a SEPERATE function for 'click' and 'tap' or 'touch'.
[12:41:16] <decx> i use wordpress because clients can actually deal with it on their own
[12:42:02] <decx> drupal or jekyll is only usable for novice clients if you put a considerable amount of time training or building backend tools
[12:42:08] <timgauthier> there are other options that work better for clients with less overhead, but thats cool
[12:42:17] <richurd> duch_kazatel: >> http://tinyurl.com/kdtmbh2
[12:42:24] <richurd> see the console, you will see this error
[12:42:34] <richurd> let me know when you opened tha page, coz its a live site
[12:42:39] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, might trigger more than 1 on some devices but there is nothing wrong with    $('#id).on('click', f...).on('tap', f....).on('touch', f...);
[12:43:08] <duch_kazatel> richurd where's dialog coming from?
[12:43:11] <DeltaHeavy> djQuery: Don't the 'click' function be triggered on all devices though when tapped?
[12:43:18] <richurd> what dialogue
[12:43:21] <richurd> did you open the page
[12:43:28] <richurd> coz i need to deactivate it
[12:43:36] <richurd> it shouldnt be on this page
[12:43:45] <duch_kazatel> richurd jQuery(...).dialog is not a function
[12:43:46] <richurd> that script shouldnt run on this page i mean
[12:43:47] <duch_kazatel> that's the error.
[12:43:49] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, if it is the same code for all 3 you could just do $('#id').on('click tap touch', f....)
[12:44:21] <DeltaHeavy> djQuery: The thing I"m saying over and over again is I need TWO different functions for each type of event :p
[12:44:30] <BillCriswell> decx: Wordpress beats the hell out of drupal for your clients side of things haha
[12:44:41] <timgauthier> i don't recommend drupal either
[12:44:42] <BillCriswell> decx: Have you tried Craft? Very user friendly.
[12:44:45] <timgauthier> i have alerts for both of those ;)
[12:44:48] <decx> heard of it
[12:44:52] <timgauthier> Craft or Perch or KirbyCMS are what i suggest
[12:45:01] <richurd> i thought of that too
[12:45:20] <BillCriswell> decx: It's pretty good so far.
[12:45:23] <timgauthier> stop saying those bad words, they make my IRC ding
[12:45:26] <BillCriswell> Only been playing around with it, though.
[12:46:07] <decx> looks pretty nice
[12:46:44] <richurd> duch_kazatel: i removed it, still same error
[12:46:45] <richurd> :S
[12:46:49] <decx> and their site says i'm going to love it so there's that
[12:47:05] <duch_kazatel> richurd that means you're calling that function somewhere.
[12:47:27] <richurd> um
[12:48:34] <richurd> calling what function ? i only see > wp_enqueue_script(' jquery-ui-dialog');
[12:48:37] <richurd> which i removed now
[12:48:55] <BillCriswell> decx: Why would they ever lie to you? You know?
[12:49:16] <decx> oh it has a business model?
[12:49:29] <duch_kazatel> richardbaker i'm not seeing that error any more.
[12:49:37] <duch_kazatel> err, richurd.
[12:49:52] <spechal> Can someone please look at http://fpaste.org/112365/35529581/ and let me know why it is not attaching the change event?
[12:50:27] <duch_kazatel> spechal there's no need to set .on() like that - the each is implied.
[12:50:30] <BillCriswell> decx: It seems crazy.
[12:50:54] <spechal> so each().on()?
[12:51:05] <duch_kazatel> spechal... no .each() at all.
[12:51:11] <duch_kazatel> .on() takes care of that for you.
[12:51:25] <duch_kazatel> $('#vagrantform :input').on();
[12:51:45] <DeltaHeavy> Anybody know how to trigger a mouse click, but not a touchscreen tap/touch?
[12:51:56] <decx> mousedown event
[12:52:25] <DeltaHeavy> decx: It's on an <a> though, and I need to prevent the default action on a 'click' event.
[12:52:35] <DeltaHeavy> decx: I tried mousedown but that doesn't allow me to prevent the default clicking action.
[12:52:48] <djQuery> spechal,  $('#vagrantform').on(, ':input', 'change keyup',  function(){});
[12:52:51] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy you passed the event object and everything?
[12:52:56] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Yup
[12:53:03] <djQuery> sorry got that in wrong order
[12:53:12] <Xliff> event.preventDefault()
[12:53:25] <Xliff> So
[12:53:30] <djQuery> spechal,  $('#vagrantform').on('change keyup', ':input',  function(){});
[12:53:34] <richurd> duch_kazatel: found out the error there was an extra space
[12:53:43] <DeltaHeavy> Xliff: Already using that. I nkow how to do that :p I need to prevent the default action on a click event and NOT a touch/tap event. That's the question.
[12:53:51] <Xliff> $('#vagrantform').on(, ':input', 'change keyup',  function(e){ e.preventDefault(); ... // more code // });
[12:54:15] <duch_kazatel> *sigh*
[12:54:45] <Xliff> DeltaHeavy: Can you fiddle what you already have?
[12:54:51] <Xliff> Just the relevant parts, please?
[12:55:00] <decx> the click event includes taps
[12:55:03] <spechal> djQuery: I changed it per your suggesstion, but my textarea does not update … I included more code so you can see what I mean … http://fpaste.org/112368/53263140/
[12:55:14] <djQuery> spechal, $('whatparent').on('whichaction(s)', 'whatchildren', dowhat)
[12:55:29] <duch_kazatel> spechal you want just updateVagrantVile - drop the () after.
[12:55:32] <spechal> djQuery: sorry, missed a spot
[12:55:47] <Xliff> DeltaHeavy: The problem there is that "touch/tap" is usually interpreted as a click.
[12:56:06] <Xliff> I don't see the distinction you are trying to make.
[12:56:32] <spechal> duch_kazatel djQuery $('#vagrantform').on('change keyup', ':input', updateVagrantfile); was perfect, thanks
[12:56:38] <DeltaHeavy> Xliff: http://jsfiddle.net/TcMts/
[12:57:01] <djQuery> spechal, yeppers just noticed your extra () in the line
[12:57:14] <DeltaHeavy> Xliff: http://jsfiddle.net/TcMts/1/
[12:57:47] <DeltaHeavy> Xliff: Forgot to include jQuery - http://jsfiddle.net/TcMts/2/
[12:58:06] <DeltaHeavy> Xliff: On touch devices I don't want this event to fire.
[12:59:04] <duch_kazatel> you mean handler.
[12:59:14] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Is that directed at me?
[12:59:18] <duch_kazatel> yes :)
[12:59:34] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Isn't the event the function?
[12:59:43] <duch_kazatel> the event is "click", the function is the handler.
[12:59:53] <RandalSchwartz> "js fiddled while rome burned"
[13:00:17] <Xliff> DeltaHeavy: Are you using jQuery mobile?
[13:00:23] <DeltaHeavy> Xliff: No
[13:00:37] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: an 'Event Handler' from what I understand is what's attached to the element. The 'event' is colloqually referred to as when 'x' happens do 'y'.
[13:00:39] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, all I can say is that you going to have to detect if it was a click tap or touch and then cancel out accordingly
[13:00:41] <DeltaHeavy> Either way this is just semantics :p
[13:00:48] <DeltaHeavy> djQuery: How though?
[13:01:24] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy "click" is the event, the handler is the function you've attached to the element for that event.  and it's important in this case because you don't want to "stop an event", you want to "stop a handler from firing"
[13:01:53] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, var is_touch_device = 'ontouchstart' in document.documentElement;
[13:02:14] <DeltaHeavy> djQuery: True, forgot about that. Thanks!
[13:02:26] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: "any function or object registered to be notified of events" - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/Events/Event_handlers
[13:03:07] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: The handler can still fire for this. I can use a solution (which seems to be the route I'm going), where the logic is the event itself.
[13:03:10] <DeltaHeavy> in the*
[13:03:15] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy oh you're convoluting "click" with ".click()"
[13:03:15] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, touch screen notebooks anyone?
[13:03:31] <Xliff> djQuery: Yup.
[13:03:56] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: How? I don't think so.
[13:04:15] <djQuery> Xliff, how is your browser experience when people are doing these kinda of things?
[13:04:41] <duch_kazatel> i give up.  apparently i'm not making sense today - "click" is an event, the function you attach to an element to fire on a click even is the handler.
[13:04:48] <Xliff> djQuery: I try to avoid using mobile for this exact reason.
[13:04:59] <duch_kazatel> *event
[13:05:31] <Xliff> Seriously, if I need a web page, I will try and use the phone *once*. If the experience pisses me off, I wait until I can get to a proper PC.
[13:06:08] <djQuery> Xliff, lol
[13:06:46] <Xliff> DeltaHeavy: Just for curiosity's sake. Why are you trying to distinguish between touch and click?
[13:07:02] <decx> click includes touch how often do i have to write that -.-
[13:07:14] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Generally people refer to the function that's triggered via a handler is an 'event'. I don't neccessarily need to stop the handler from firing to have it not execute the majority of my event.
[13:07:31] <Xliff> decx: That's my point.
[13:07:33] <jParkton> so why is there a touch if it is the same as click?
[13:07:35] <DeltaHeavy> decx: I know, did I say anything against that?
[13:07:39] <jParkton> case use thing?
[13:07:41] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy i have never personally heard of people saying that, but whatevs.
[13:07:42] <decx> if you juts want it for mouseclicks use mousedown what's the problem?
[13:07:59] <duch_kazatel> for the record, http://api.jquery.com/on/ agrees with me.
[13:08:11] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: MDN agrees with me
[13:08:22] <Xliff> Oh no he didn't! :D
[13:08:24] <jParkton> oh shit!
[13:08:26] <DeltaHeavy> decx: Because that's not what an anchor tag uses to redirect to new link.
[13:08:28] <jParkton> DOC WARS!!!
[13:08:57] <decx> wat?
[13:08:59] <DeltaHeavy> decx: If I use preventDefault() on a 'mousedown' event, it won't stop it from going where the anchor tag is pointing to.
[13:08:59] <RandalSchwartz> sometimes a touch is a bad touch :)
[13:09:13] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy no, it doesn't.
[13:09:20] <decx> wat?
[13:09:32] <DeltaHeavy> decx: I'm not sure how to put it any simpler.
[13:10:04] <Xliff> DeltaHeavy: Take a deep breath, forget jQuery, and tell us what you are trying to do.
[13:10:34] <Xliff> Because I think we are all getting hung up on the details, rather than the intended implementation.
[13:10:40] <DeltaHeavy> Xliff: I have a bunch of YouTube links. On mobile devices, I want it to use the app built in. Otherwise I need to use a shittily designed popup to play them in browser.
[13:10:42] <duch_kazatel> he wants to fire a hanlder on touch and a separate handler on click as far as I can tell.
[13:11:02] <duch_kazatel> doesn't the phone handle that part for you?
[13:11:12] <duch_kazatel> ah i get it, nevermind.
[13:11:31] <duch_kazatel> why not just detect if the user is currently in a mobile browser?
[13:11:37] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: How?
[13:11:44] <DeltaHeavy> Server side?
[13:12:09] <Xliff> <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, var is_touch_device = 'ontouchstart' in document.documentElement;
[13:12:24] <BillCriswell> My desktop is a touch screen.
[13:12:27] <DeltaHeavy> Xliff: I know :p
[13:12:41] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: Yeah, I'm wondering if there's a better way to go about this now. You guys are a small minority though.
[13:12:56] <decx> is jquery.com down?
[13:13:03] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy they won't be for much longer ;)
[13:13:17] <DeltaHeavy> True
[13:13:22] <DeltaHeavy> What else can I really do here?
[13:13:28] <duch_kazatel> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11381673/javascript-solution-to-detect-mobile-browser
[13:13:33] <duch_kazatel> there are a few answer here.
[13:13:39] <BillCriswell> I'd let the browser decide. Do what you planned on doing and if the user has the YouTube app set to open up YouTube links it should just take over.
[13:14:08] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: But if I'm running event.preventDefault(), won't that stop that?
[13:14:15] <duch_kazatel> the problem with touch these days is that IE11 reports it supports touch always, even if the user doesn't have a touchscreen.
[13:14:26] <DeltaHeavy> Fack
[13:14:43] <Xliff> Ah, Microsoft.
[13:14:54] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: That sucks.
[13:14:58] * Xliff shakes head solemly.
[13:15:10] <duch_kazatel> we got bit by it once.  i'm willing to take that tradeoff personally.
[13:15:34] <duch_kazatel> the fix was easier than all the wrangling I had to do to get pushstates working right in chrome.
[13:15:53] <decx> how come i never realized that mousedown with preventdef doesnt stop anchor clicks, thanks for the new info though DeltaHeavy
[13:16:02] <DeltaHeavy> decx: np
[13:16:15] <BillCriswell> DeltaHeavy: I wouldn't do the preventDefault probably. I'd have to mess around with it a bit. I'm just going for common sense without actually testing anything yet haha. I just kind of feel like that's how things would play out?
[13:16:26] <BillCriswell> I alos wasn't listening to the whole problem.
[13:16:30] <DeltaHeavy> duch_kazatel: Will the solutions this SO stop working if there are updates and stuff? This site will probalby be left unattended for years and years.
[13:16:30] <BillCriswell> So there's that.
[13:16:39] <Xliff> BillCriswell: Your comment makes some sense, though.
[13:17:04] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: I understand. I can't have the default action happen for desktops though as I want to show the YouTube video in the same page.
[13:17:19] <Xliff> Ah. Now I see.
[13:17:39] <DeltaHeavy> This is turning out to be a lot more difficult than I thought lol
[13:17:43] <duch_kazatel> DeltaHeavy they might stop working at some point.  but that's going to be the case for most solutions out there I'd bet.
[13:17:43] <BillCriswell> So the preventDefault() would totally keep it from playing in the app all together I'd imagine?
[13:17:48] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone experience with Isotope? I have it smart center the container so the gaps on both sides of the container remain equal. It works fine, but when I do a filter that results in less than 2 items, the container collapses to the width of those 2 items. How to keep the container unchanged on a filter?
[13:17:51] <Xliff> Yeah. That happens.
[13:17:55] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, http://stackoverflow.com/a/14472440/295800
[13:18:14] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, window.onmouseover
[13:18:31] <DeltaHeavy> djQuery: Already got that figured out. Think is that screwes up people on non-mobile/tablet devices with touchscreens, and IE11 users.
[13:18:35] <duch_kazatel> hah, that's clever.
[13:18:45] <DeltaHeavy> BillCriswell: It would
[13:19:19] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, that should at least be IE11 safe
[13:19:42] <duch_kazatel> until they tap using their finger.
[13:19:46] <DeltaHeavy> djQuery: It requires Modernizr too. Don't want to use that.
[13:20:08] <Xliff> DeltaHeavy: No, if you don't use Modernizr then leave that line out.
[13:20:33] <DeltaHeavy> True...
[13:21:14] <DeltaHeavy> I do'nt think there's relaly a graceful solution to this.
[13:21:56] <duch_kazatel> other than browser sniffing, you're kind of SOL.  i'd have links play in page or open in a new window.
[13:22:12] <duch_kazatel> the latter is nice because that'll cause it to open in the app by default iirc.
[13:22:45] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, did you read the whole answer?   OR JUST PURE JS?
[13:23:07] <DeltaHeavy> djQuery: It's like 2 sentances. Yes I did
[13:23:16] <DeltaHeavy> I guess touch screen desktop users will just have to deal with it opening a new tab for this stuff.
[13:23:27] <djQuery> DeltaHeavy, dang looks like false negative on ipad
[13:23:36] <DeltaHeavy> fuuu
[13:24:25] <djQuery> oh well tried next Q
[13:25:45] <Xliff> LOL
[13:26:01] <Xliff> DeltaHeavy: Good luck, man.
[13:26:18] <DeltaHeavy> Thanks
[13:26:22] <djQuery> anyone do any of these? http://www.codingame.com/cg/#!challenge:35
[13:26:33] <DeltaHeavy> It's not perfect but it's good enough. Still gets the job done regardless of what you're using.
[13:27:18] <Xliff> djQuery: Can't say that I have.
[13:27:49] <duch_kazatel> ugh i have a coworker that keeps breaking our js conventions and refuses to listen to people who tell him not to.
[13:27:52] <duch_kazatel> really getting old.
[13:28:33] <decx> arent you code review? lay down the law
[13:29:11] <duch_kazatel> only on the ones i see, and some folks are lazy and not catching it like they should.
[13:29:11] <Xliff> duch_kazatel: Which conventions is he not following?
[13:29:21] <duch_kazatel> if (condition) do this thing.
[13:29:42] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Punch them in their privates.
[13:29:50] <duch_kazatel> no curlies or newlines for ifs in general.  if you want to disagree, that's fine.  don't start forging ahead just because you disagree.
[13:30:04] <Xliff> Aaieee!
[13:30:14] <Xliff> Readability FTW, dammit!
[13:30:23] <duch_kazatel> they think it's more readable their way ;)
[13:30:42] <Xliff> duch_kazatel: THEY are wrong!
[13:30:48] <duch_kazatel> lol
[13:31:02] <Xliff> Code should be vertical, not horizontal.
[13:31:28] <__joshua___> not that i support them on this, but at least they are keeping it on one line (slightly less likely to lead to bugs)
[13:31:32] <Xliff> <- My personal opinion
[13:31:37] <__joshua___> ie, apples GOTO bug from a few months ago
[13:32:10] <duch_kazatel> they do break it into two lines when things get long enough.
[13:32:18] <Xliff> One liners can be a problem if they are too long.
[13:32:19] <__joshua___> danger
[13:32:21] <duch_kazatel> i'm still not a fan
[13:32:27] <djQuery> duch_kazatel, I agree its more readable but only when its a single line, that said it doesn't mater what I think there is a correct way to do it
[13:32:59] <duch_kazatel> they're still learning the ropes of working in a group I think.
[13:33:00] <__joshua___> there is no correct way.  there is convention, and their is consistency within a project.
[13:33:07] <duch_kazatel> bingo
[13:33:25] <Xliff> __joshua___++
[13:33:43] <duch_kazatel> i'm not saying the rest of us are necessarily right (though I think we are), only that convention is critical when you work on a larger codebase like ours.
[13:33:59] <duch_kazatel> or in any team-based project, really.
[13:34:03] <Xliff> duch_kazatel: And working in a group.
[13:34:05] <Xliff> LOL
[13:34:22] <duch_kazatel> I've been around the block enough times at this point.  he'll learn
[13:34:35] <djQuery> duch_kazatel, no tools to catch this when they do the build\checkin?
[13:34:42] <Xliff> Like someone else said -- lay down da law.
[13:34:55] <__joshua___> Im having the same issues with the new guys here.  they are forgetting "use strict" (and thus occasionally declaring globals).  they are using '==', which I don't want to ever see in this project.  not right or wrong, but inconsistent.
[13:34:59] <Xliff> djQuery: Oh, ghod. Writing such a thing would be ass.
[13:35:33] <__joshua___> im sure you could tune a linter to pick that up
[13:35:43] <Xliff> __joshua___: "==" or "==="?
[13:35:46] <duch_kazatel> we're working towards it, djQuery.  this particular file is kind of exempt from all those rules at the moment - the majority of the code in it is around 8 years old at this point.
[13:35:58] <duch_kazatel> it's also the last file in our mootools abatement project for this particular section of the codebase.
[13:36:10] <djQuery> Xliff, jslint allready detects this just tried it
[13:36:21] <BillCriswell> I love the number 12 so much.
[13:36:28] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell working with a grid?
[13:36:30] <Xliff> djQuery: So that's me spanked! :)
[13:36:39] <__joshua___> Xliff: new guys are using '==' everywhere.  I only want to see === and !==. we have no reason for weak comparison
[13:36:44] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[13:37:00] <Xliff> __joshua___: Took me a while to learn that, myself.
[13:37:05] <BillCriswell> My favorite number is 11... but it's not very useful for a website haha.
[13:37:12] <Xliff> They'll come around once they get the point.
[13:38:10] <__joshua___> for instance, http://www.javascriptlint.com/ finds 'if' etc without curlies
[13:38:38] <Xliff> Yeah, djQuery already got me with that one.
[13:38:41] <__joshua___> if we fail a violation on our build system it fails the test (typically is console.logs etc)
[13:39:02] <djQuery> jslint seems to be the most popular and seems to have plugins for most editors
[13:39:13] <duch_kazatel> we're already using jshint and working on a real build system for our js.  our actual codebase is a little unique in that the frontend really doesn't require a build step for most stuff.
[13:39:59] <__joshua___> that old eh duch?
[13:40:14] <duch_kazatel> and in coldfusion
[13:40:22] <__joshua___> ah. huh.
[13:40:43] <__joshua___> we took a few days of development to port our mess to requirejs
[13:41:18] <Xliff> Ah. ColdFusion.
[13:41:46] <Xliff> Give me a real language and templates, anyday!
[13:42:19] <Xliff> Although you can do MVC in ColdFusion....
[13:42:23] <__joshua___> 47549 loc of js as of today.  that means we have shed 10k in the past 2 months or so.  yay.
[13:42:50] <djQuery> __joshua___, ?
[13:42:53] <Xliff> Not bad!
[13:43:05] <duch_kazatel> we're really only using CF for generating markup at this point.  we have a whole java backend services layer that's frontend-agnostic.
[13:43:31] <duch_kazatel> not bad at all, __joshua___
[13:43:37] <__joshua___> djQuery: the size of the front end part of our project
[13:44:15] <Xliff> duch_kazatel: Using a markup based language to generate markup. Oh, the symmetry!
[13:44:36] <duch_kazatel> it's pretty terrifying.  we're moving things to cfscript where we can to avoid doing that any more.
[13:45:01] * Xliff cackles!
[13:55:24] <richurd> what is this > ? > Uncaught ReferenceError: F is not defined
[13:56:28] <BillCriswell> richurd: A variable F is not defined.
[13:56:29] <__joshua___> richurd:  pretty much what is says.
[13:57:27] <richurd> but i have not declared it anywhere
[13:57:30] <richurd> how can i debug it
[13:57:53] <duch_kazatel> something is trying to use it before it's available.
[13:58:06] <duch_kazatel> there should be a filename and line number next the error.
[14:17:23] <richurd> woah stackoverflow is down
[14:18:33] <duch_kazatel> funky
[14:21:42] <decx> can somebody shed some light on the for loop in the first function here http://jsfiddle.net/decx/G9XqE/ ?
[14:21:57] <decx> i gave up on trying to understand the actual math but that whole construct is strange
[14:22:18] <Xal_> I'm trying to use jquery.browsers.js. When I look at the site on an android device,  $.browser.android doesn't seem to be returning true.
[14:22:55] <systemfault> Xal_: do you use the android browser or chrome?
[14:22:57] <__joshua___> the point in poly one?
[14:23:13] <decx> yea
[14:23:25] <__joshua___> its an odd construction, the the last part is what you are interested in
[14:23:33] <__joshua___> if everything else is true, c = !c;
[14:23:49] <Xal_> Wait, that only works on the default browser?
[14:24:25] <decx> i thought that, but how does it do that if its part of the condition with the &&
[14:24:26] <Xal_> I just tried the default browser and it still didn't work.
[14:24:52] <Xal_> Is there a way to detect an android device, regardless of what browser is being used?
[14:25:52] <systemfault> Xal_: I just looked at the source, seems that $.browser.platform exists.
[14:25:59] <__joshua___> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-circuit_evaluation
[14:26:30] <richurd> how can i convert a variable to all lowercase, and replace spaces with hypehn
[14:26:39] <decx> oh so its for(...) if(...) { return c }
[14:27:22] <duch_kazatel> richurd str.toLowerCase().replace(/ /g, '-');
[14:28:31] <Xal_> Here's my actual problem. I have a server script that returns a calendar file. I have a querystring parameter that can make it switch between ics (android) and ical (apple) (windows can apparently accept either). I need to be able to determine which file to send the user. The link is being created by jquery in the first place.
[14:28:34] <decx> aaaah, thanks __joshua___
[14:32:21] <duch_kazatel> http://map.ipviking.com/
[14:40:17] <Xal_> Got it. I forwent jquery.browsers.js entirely and went directly for navigator.userAgent
[14:40:51] <gnu_d> Hi, how do I change the text in a label ?
[14:41:04] <gnu_d> I tried .text, it's not working
[14:41:30] <djQuery_> gnu_d, $('labelselector').text('Hello World');
[14:41:51] <Roundaround> gnu_d: ^ - the .text() function should work
[14:41:56] <djQuery_> gnu_d, console.log($('labelselector'));
[14:42:06] <djQuery_> make sure you are selecting it correctly
[14:42:33] <gnu_d> I'm using it like this: $('#item').text('fdf')
[14:42:48] <djQuery_> gnu_d, .html()
[14:42:49] <gnu_d> the $('#item') is being selected
[14:43:18] <gnu_d> djQuery_: I tried the .html() too, even InnerHtml and TextContent
[14:43:29] <Roundaround> gnu_d: http://jsfiddle.net/Uv5Wg/
[14:43:30] <Xliff> gnu_d: Can you fiddle the important bits of what you have?
[14:43:39] <Roundaround> demonstrating that .text should work
[14:44:00] <Roundaround> so make sure your selector is correct and that you have no other elements within the label
[14:44:07] <Xliff> If your selector is correct, it might be a DOM issue.
[14:44:11] <Roundaround> ^
[14:45:03] <Xliff> gnu_d: For issues like this, it is always better to include a fiddle with the issue.
[14:45:27] <gnu_d> Xliff: the thing is the code is ok, mine and yours
[14:45:37] <Xliff> decx: Dude. That loop condition was INSANE. It hurt my brain, but I've always been a fan of short circuiting.
[14:46:06] <Xliff> gnu_d: Still, a fiddle will help us address the issue correctly instead of guessing.
[14:46:22] <__joshua___> Xliff: its only so bad because its a common function (in heaps of languages)
[14:47:11] <Xliff> Still...
[14:47:19] <decx> Xliff here's a nice overview http://www.ecse.rpi.edu/Homepages/wrf/Research/Short_Notes/pnpoly.html
[14:47:26] <decx> based on 30 year old fortran code
[14:47:27] <Xliff> That code is why readability nazis like me exist.
[14:48:27] <Xliff> decx: You said FORTRAN.  I rest my case! :)
[14:48:55] <Xliff> Of course, I tried APL -waay- back in the day.
[14:49:14] <Xliff> Please don't make me relive that nightmare.
[14:49:21] <gnu_d> Weird, the selector was working, but didn't select the right thing, I added this: label#item, and then .text started working
[14:49:29] <Xliff> LOL!
[14:49:38] <__joshua___> fukcing apl.  slightly more readable than brainfuck.
[14:49:43] <Xliff> gnu_d: Then your selector was not correct. I still would be interested in seeing the markup.
[14:49:49] <erming> how can i create an empty list of objects, and then use .add() to append stuff
[14:49:57] <Xliff> It's quite possible that you have two elements with the "item" id.
[14:49:58] <djQuery_> gnu_d, then you have improper html i.e. 2 itmes on the page with the same id
[14:49:59] <gnu_d> Xliff: yes, but why the object was found ?
[14:50:02] <erming> var list = $(); list.add($obj); doesn't really work
[14:50:31] <Xliff> gnu_d: I beat djQuery_ with hthe right answer by SECONDS!
[14:50:57] <__joshua___> dont do this. var x = [];  x.add = x.push;  x.add(1);
[14:50:57] <djQuery_> erming,  var list = $();list =  list.add($obj);
[14:51:03] <Xliff> There is at least one other element with the "item" id before your label.
[14:51:14] <erming> djQuery_: ah, will try. thanks :>
[14:51:31] <djQuery_> Xliff, watching "Last ship"
[14:51:33] <gnu_d> djQuery_: the id is only defined once :(
[14:51:53] <Xliff> __joshua___: Go ahead... tell us how you REALLY feel. But seriously... "brainfuck"? That's apt.
[14:52:07] <djQuery_> gnu_d, console.log it so that you can see what it is returning
[14:52:19] <Xliff> djQuery_: Ohshit! That's aired now?
[14:52:28] <gnu_d> djQuery_: I got two matches for that id, where it's defined in the html, and inside the js code where I select it
[14:52:28] <djQuery_> Xliff, last night
[14:52:51] <duch_kazatel> gnu_d did you put that ID on an element you add with JS?
[14:53:00] <Xliff> gnu_d: Can you pastebin or fiddle the HTML, please?
[14:53:12] <gnu_d> Xliff: it's working now, nevermind
[14:53:51] <Xliff> gnu_d: I know. I just wanted to see it! :)
[14:55:09] <djQuery_> 99% of the time when I have been beating my head on a keyboard for half an hour and finally ask on here it was a typo
[14:55:26] <Xliff> It happens to the best of us.
[14:55:52] <decx> <div id="#itshouldbeworking">
[14:55:55] <Xliff> However, I feel I have more than my fair share of those why-didn't-I-see-it moments.
[14:56:32] <Xliff> <tag id="dontforgettheendquote_idiot>
[14:56:52] <Xliff> ^ Way, way, way, waaay too many times.
[14:57:26] <Xliff> That's why I am going to argue for a <headdesk /> tag
[14:57:31] <duch_kazatel> that's partially why i love my syntax highlighing scheme - it makes those REALLY apparently.
[14:57:38] <duch_kazatel> *apparently.  at least the latter.
[14:57:56] <Xliff> *apparent
[14:58:39] <duch_kazatel> one of those days
[14:59:32] <erming> got bored, so I implemented Game of Life in js/jquery: http://erming.github.io/game-of-life/
[15:00:18] <Xliff> erming: It's not working for me.
[15:00:26] <Xliff> And yes. I've checked the console, this time.
[15:00:37] <erming> :( what browser
[15:00:42] <Xliff> Chrome
[15:00:45] <Xliff> Lemme try FF
[15:00:58] <djQuery_> ;( me either
[15:01:12] <duch_kazatel> looks like it needs to be "paused" first?
[15:03:03] <erming> hmm
[15:03:09] <erming> i can't get it to _not_ work.. that's weird
[15:03:29] <Xliff> Nothing for FF
[15:03:39] <duch_kazatel> works fine for me in FF
[15:03:41] <Xliff> And no errors, either.
[15:03:46] <Xliff> Lemme reload.
[15:03:48] <erming> Xliff: you know the rules?
[15:03:50] <erming> hehe
[15:03:52] <decx> you need to draw something :>
[15:04:02] <Xliff> Oh, damn.
[15:04:09] <Xliff> <headdesk />
[15:04:12] <Xliff> ^ SEE?!?
[15:04:17] <duch_kazatel> !g conway's game of life
[15:04:18] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: Conway's Game of Life - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia → http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life
[15:04:20] <djQuery_> ff works for me but not chrome
[15:04:21] <erming> hahaha, you n00b! :p
[15:04:35] <djQuery_> wont let me draw more than 1 square
[15:05:05] <duch_kazatel> pause it.
[15:05:08] <duch_kazatel> or draw a line.
[15:05:16] <Xliff> erming: I remember this game!
[15:05:31] <Xliff> I keep trying to win it by turning evey square a single color. I hates it!
[15:05:36] <Xliff> I never win!
[15:05:36] <djQuery_> k its werkin
[15:06:04] <erming> hmm, should probably add some kind of smart auto-pause
[15:06:10] <erming> thanks for trying it guys :D hah
[15:06:12] <Xliff> erming: Yes, I deserve the n00b for that one.
[15:06:25] <duch_kazatel> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2vgICfQawE
[15:06:31] <erming> http://www.conwaylife.com/w/images/7/79/Glider.png
[15:06:32] <erming> try that one
[15:06:33] <duch_kazatel> it gets bigger and bigger.
[15:07:17] <Xliff> And here I was thinking you were cool and implemented this - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Game_of_Life
[15:08:17] <erming> lol duch_kazatel
[15:08:21] <duch_kazatel> :D
[15:10:19] <Tadas> how do I delete the text that's in input field? <input id="q" type="text" size="40" placeholder="Search..."/> $('#q').text(''); won't work
[15:10:41] <djQuery_> Tadas, null not ''
[15:10:56] <Tadas> null ? :)
[15:10:58] <Tadas> thanks
[15:11:01] <Tadas> gotta try it
[15:11:10] <Xliff> duch_kazatel: Oh my fractals! That's awesome.
[15:12:10] <systemfault> Tadas: .val(‘’) for inputs
[15:12:19] <Tadas> djQuery_, still doesn't work
[15:12:20] <systemfault> (with the proper single-quotes)
[15:12:34] <systemfault> Tadas: .val('')
[15:12:51] <Tadas> yes!
[15:12:53] <Tadas> thanks a lot
[15:12:57] <Tadas> :)
[15:14:13] <Jadenn> 'ello, i'm having an issue with jQuery's append function. i've verified my data from the server when it gets received by the client, and again after it gets processed for bbcode. the data is intact until i try to append it to an element, in which case the last span in the div gets stripped. raw data: http://puu.sh/9Hcor.png - processed data: http://puu.sh/9HcpJ.png - DOM data: http://puu.sh/9HctC.png
[15:15:52] <Jadenn> and the code http://paste.arviksa.co.uk/jehewiweloyeficu
[15:16:08] <__joshua___> the span gets stripped?
[15:16:24] <__joshua___> class is not close quoted
[15:17:08] <Xliff> Yup
[15:17:09] <Jadenn> aha insane catch mate. many thanks!
[15:17:37] <Xliff> Another one for <headdesk />
[15:17:46] <Xliff> I'm tellin' ya. I am going to start this meme.
[15:17:49] <Jadenn> indeed
[15:19:35] <Xliff> Now I am about to watch the Last Ship, which comes from Michael Bay.
[15:19:47] <Xliff> It's "Bay" Watch without the beach.
[15:24:02] <djQuery_> erming, lol didn't have as much mem as I thought I did changed cols to 230 and rows to 340 and its kinda hanging
[15:26:21] <erming> djQuery_ heh, yeah.. that's why i asked for a way to stash the elements in an array
[15:26:57] <erming> but right now it's just adding classes then fetching them with $(".class");
[15:27:53] <erming> 230*340 = 78200 <td> elements :>
[15:28:02] <decx> it's also building an all new table every 100ms woot
[15:28:19] <erming> decx: is it?
[15:28:20] <djQuery_> erming, still big proc here and 32 gig ram
[15:29:09] <decx> oh right only on refresh
[15:29:26] <erming> yeah, had to check :> hah
[15:29:38] <djQuery_> be cool to see if I could do some kinda databind to this
[15:29:42] <erming> CSS3 transition is quite cool
[15:29:46] <Xliff> decx: <headdesk /> ?
[15:29:52] <erming> i can play around with colors and opacity etc
[15:30:12] <djQuery_> Xliff, stop pushing it let it dev naturaly
[15:30:13] <decx> stop Xliff it's never going to catch on
[15:30:36] <Xliff> :(
[15:30:46] <decx> see you oversaturated us already :D
[15:31:03] <Xliff> djQuery_: The way to get it to catch on is to make sure it stays in everyones mind.
[15:31:22] <Xliff> decx: Awww....
[15:31:31] <erming> change transition on Line 28 to something high
[15:31:37] <erming> = art.. yeah baby
[15:31:52] <djQuery_> slams Xliff headdesk
[15:31:54] <duch_kazatel> Xliff the only thing about that that’ll “catch on” is fire.
[15:32:08] <Xliff> OW!
[15:32:13] <duch_kazatel> *zing*
[15:32:17] <Xliff> duch_kazatel: I can live with that.
[15:32:34] <djQuery_> you have to have a .gif for something to catch on anymore
[15:32:45] <duch_kazatel> a gif or a video.
[15:32:52] <Xliff> :P
[15:33:03] <Xliff> People have become too jaded for text?
[15:33:16] <Xliff> What, they want demotivational wallpapers now?
[15:33:56] <Xliff> I can make one and post it here. Put it in the /topic! :D
[15:34:41] <decx> Xliff http://i.imgur.com/8q8kEY6.png
[15:34:43] <djQuery_> just remember that everyone here now will just be thinking about slaming your head into the desk everytime it comes up
[15:34:59] <Xliff> decx: LOL!
[15:35:12] <Xliff> djQuery_: Naw. I just have to be slick about it.
[15:35:24] <Xliff> And only YOU thought that one up. There will be retaliation! :D
[15:35:25] <erming> http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ugiQAGLV4Bc/TlIKoMXX0zI/AAAAAAAAAOE/2jgBR_7j7yE/s1600/cone.jpg
[15:35:45] <decx> that's the most ineffective headdesk i've ever seen
[15:35:47] <Xliff> erming: That's not <headdesk /> that's <headplant />
[15:36:12] <Xliff> Suplex anyone?
[15:38:41] <Xliff> erming: Where are these transitions again?
[15:38:58] <erming> style.css, Line 28
[15:39:00] <Xliff> Ah. They are in the CSS file, nevermind.
[15:39:04] <erming> lol
[15:39:17] <erming> *bam*
[15:39:27] <erming> go crazy, like 1s or something
[15:39:34] <Xliff> That was not a <headdesk /> you fool!
[15:39:44] <erming> it's will look like ripples in the wter
[15:43:46] <Xliff> 80 x 60 isn't bad.
[15:45:38] * Xliff shakes fist at erming.
[15:45:53] <Xliff> Now I'm hooked. I will be messing with this for the next hour, dammit.
[15:46:09] <Xliff> Fiddling with CSS transitions and dimensions.
[15:46:34] <Xliff> "erming| <muahahahaha />"
[15:46:49] <erming> feel free to clone/fork it
[15:46:58] <erming> you could add trails and stuff
[15:47:03] <Xliff> Don't tempt me! :)
[15:47:09] <erming> like.. after they die, you add ".trail" to them
[15:47:11] <erming> and style that stuff too
[15:47:12] <erming> :D
[15:47:47] <Xliff> Now baywatching Last Ship.
[15:47:56] <erming> or add some kind of "awesomeness" counter.. the longer they stay alive, the higher the count
[15:48:31] <erming> i'll have to sleep.. o/
[16:56:48] <sammych> I think I know the answer to this: what is the most 'private' a data member be in JS?
[16:57:14] <duch_kazatel> wut
[16:57:16] <sammych> what I seem to have read is that constructor 'this.fieldName' is as private as you can get
[16:57:52] <duch_kazatel> hiding things in closures works, but then you can’t access outside of that scope.
[16:58:07] <duch_kazatel> iirc you can kindof half-emulate scope, but it’s awkward.
[16:58:11] <sammych> I'm trying to protect some data as much as possible from slightly motivated people
[16:58:29] <duch_kazatel> what is the data?
[16:58:58] <sammych> it's data on an MVC-type web app
[16:59:29] <duch_kazatel> you can wrap everything up in a closure.
[16:59:37] <duch_kazatel> but there’s no way to truly protect anything.
[16:59:59] <sammych> you can ultimately change any data with a breakpoint/debug, right?
[17:00:25] <duch_kazatel> yep.  you cannot stop me from doing what i want.
[17:01:09] <sammych> the data engine on this platform automatically sends changes to data back to the server
[17:01:46] <sammych> I was hoping to leave some of the validation of data on the client, but more obfuscated
[17:01:46] <duch_kazatel> okay?  doesn’t change much from the client side - you can’t really protect anything.
[17:01:54] <duch_kazatel> that should be done server-sive.
[17:01:55] <duch_kazatel> *side
[17:02:11] <duch_kazatel> client-side validation for convenience, server-side for integrity/security.
[17:02:25] <sammych> don't get me wrong, I get that
[17:03:37] <sammych> serverside validation is cumbersome, not really suited to the only IDE I can use
[17:03:43] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[17:03:51] <duch_kazatel> if you care, you will validate server-side.
[17:03:51] <Fall> O_o
[17:04:13] <sammych> yes, it's wrong
[17:04:37] <duch_kazatel> that statement doesn’t make much sense btw.
[17:05:24] <sammych> let me step back
[17:06:58] <sammych> you bind data to a form element. when the user changes that data, it's reflected back in the server
[17:07:21] <sammych> it's stored right back into the original object on the server
[17:07:38] <sammych> I can't control that, unless I create a clone of that element
[17:07:51] <duch_kazatel> the server part?
[17:07:53] <sammych> and then copy everything that is allowed to change into the original
[17:08:58] <duch_kazatel> what can’t you control here?  because before you were saying something about your IDE (which still doesn’t make sense), and now you’re saying you cannot change anything about the server.
[17:09:17] <sammych> the platform is essentially a black box
[17:09:26] <duch_kazatel> if your concern is with security, you cannot rely on client-side validation.  Once I have the page, I am able to effectively do as I please.
[17:09:42] <sammych> and the IDE sucks
[17:10:01] <duch_kazatel> the IDE should have nothing to do with the environment.  Get a better one if it’s such a big problem.
[17:10:22] <sammych> it's a proprietory platform, with it's own proprietory IDE
[17:10:36] <duch_kazatel> well, let me correct that - you may be encumbered depending on the particular stack, but you should be able to configure your editor to do what you need.  what’t the platform?
[17:10:58] <sammych> it's an IBM platform, not one of their open sourcey ones
[17:11:17] <shoky> those are the worst :)
[17:11:36] <sammych> if you knew how much this IDE sucked, you'd understand
[17:11:43] <duch_kazatel> what’s the IDE?
[17:11:51] <shoky> i've worked with IBM IDE's for many years
[17:11:57] <Xliff> Ew.
[17:11:58] <shoky> i understand exactly how much they suck :P
[17:12:01] <sammych> it's a heavily stripped down version of Eclipse 1 or something
[17:12:26] <sammych> I'm basically venting now
[17:12:27] <Xliff> <commandment>Thou shalt not use IBM and IDE in the same sentence...</commandment>
[17:13:05] <sammych> thanks, shoky
[17:13:34] <Xliff> Yup. One of their sucky IDEs to work in websphere.
[17:13:41] <Xliff> And WebSphere sucks.
[17:13:43] <sammych> I've got a workaround, but I haven't tested it's performance
[17:13:48] <sammych> yes. websphere
[17:14:00] <sammych> everything about it screams web 0.1
[17:14:24] <duch_kazatel> isn’t that supposed to be one of their enterprisey solutions?
[17:14:27] <duch_kazatel> for internal use?
[17:14:38] <sammych> it IS an enterprise platform
[17:14:49] <Xliff> <confucious>The only thing worse than WebSphere is an obsolete version of WebSphere.</confucious>
[17:14:59] <shoky> it's a java EE app server
[17:14:59] <sammych> hah
[17:15:29] <shoky> and, you can run it outside of the IDE if you want
[17:15:37] <Xliff> I may prove my insolence by saying this...
[17:15:42] <sammych> websphere has a lot of subbrands though
[17:15:44] <shoky> just gotta read 15000 pages of documentation to find out how
[17:15:45] <Xliff> but: Glassfish > WebSphere
[17:16:03] <duch_kazatel> ah so it’s like every other Java setup out there - really awful until it isn’t.
[17:16:22] <duch_kazatel> you just have to read a ton of documentation to get there.
[17:16:26] <shoky> and use their leet "IBM Update Installer Install Package For Installing Update Packages Installer PAckager Package"
[17:16:29] <shoky> *100
[17:16:35] <sammych> I'm not so bothered by WebSphere, since I don't directly deal with it, just one of the services it hosts
[17:17:04] <Xliff> sammych: Just wait until you have to install it.
[17:17:08] <Xliff> And administrate it.
[17:17:09] <sammych> One of our technical consultants was tasked with updating from one major version to another
[17:17:13] <Xliff> And THEN develop on it.
[17:17:13] <sammych> it took him a month
[17:17:16] <sammych> and he quit
[17:17:47] <Xliff> Ahhh... yes.
[17:17:53] <sammych> yeah. We hired a guy with WS background
[17:17:57] <sammych> I leave it all to him
[17:18:12] <Xliff> That poor bastard.
[17:18:19] <sammych> he seems happy
[17:18:30] <Xliff> <- was that poor bastard
[17:18:43] <sammych> I'm the lucky guy who really only has to deal with the presentation
[17:18:57] <sammych> that's the HTML/CSS/JS and SQL part of the implementation
[17:18:58] <Xliff> Oh, once you grok the skeezy way IBM has it set up, you can finally find peace.
[17:19:03] <Xliff> It's just getting there that's the problem.
[17:19:06] <Xliff> I never got there.
[17:19:16] <sammych> we're about to do another upgrade, right after I do this cert
[17:19:18] <duch_kazatel> i wish i was able to stay in html/css/js land mor eoften.
[17:19:40] <Xliff> Oh certs. Joy.
[17:19:52] <sammych> 4.5 hours until exam :)
[17:19:57] * Xliff mutters something about Java and it's crazy certificate management system.
[17:20:07] <sammych> 72 multiple choice questions :)
[17:20:19] <Xliff> Oh. Certification, not certificate! <headdesk />
[17:20:23] <Xliff> =)
[17:20:25] <duch_kazatel> sam452 wut.  what cert?
[17:20:39] <sammych> worklight sales mastery 1 or something
[17:20:45] * Xliff waits...
[17:20:50] <sammych> there's like 10 other fluffy words in there
[17:21:09] <duch_kazatel> i still don’t get how certifications still exist.
[17:21:28] <sammych> neither do I, but it means I get a week to fluff around talking on IRC
[17:21:29] <Xliff> duch_kazatel: Blame Microsoft, IBM and now.... Red Hat
[17:22:06] <duch_kazatel> i can see it for some things - SAP for instance.  but the poor saps still paying for that stuff kind of bum me out.
[17:22:11] <Xliff> Oh! And... Oracle, and Cisco
[17:22:43] <Xliff> duch_kazatel: Saps will keep paying for that stuff as long as job postings still mention them.
[17:24:10] <sammych> I'm just glad my career skills isn't dominated by WS
[17:24:14] <sammych> are*
[17:24:34] <sammych> I can freely move away from WS
[17:25:06] <Xliff> Yes. Good for you.
[17:25:22] <sammych> bitterness, I sense
[17:25:34] <Xliff> I feel sorry for most of those poor developers that pour everything they have behind a single technology stack.
[17:25:45] <Xliff> Bitter? Me? Non.
[17:25:56] <Xliff> Never bought into the cert business, but I know people who have.
[17:25:57] <sammych> what do you do now?
[17:26:00] <Xliff> Not worth my time.
[17:26:11] <Xliff> Was developer, soon to be requirements writer.
[17:26:18] <sammych> we need cert to sell licenses
[17:26:22] <Xliff> At least for a bit. Wanted a change of pace to see how it is on the other side.
[17:26:24] <sammych> ow
[17:26:37] <shoky> to sell licenses for what?
[17:26:39] <Xliff> I feel I will run back to the developer side soon enough, but hey.
[17:26:40] <sammych> is that like consulting?
[17:26:43] <sammych> worklight
[17:27:30] * shoky shudders
[17:27:41] <sammych> depends on which pays more vs obligation to stay late
[17:28:39] <duch_kazatel> lol i remember those days.
[17:28:45] <sammych> rather move into technical consulting and get regular hours
[17:28:45] <duch_kazatel> so glad i got out.
[17:29:10] <sammych> the number of midnight days I had at the end of last year
[17:29:32] <sammych> at least they gave me bonus leave
[17:34:09] <duch_kazatel> yeah that’s a pile of no.
[17:34:18] <duch_kazatel> i don’t think i’ll ever go back to working crazy hours like that.
[17:38:11] <Xliff> Oh, Michael Bay. Why is it that the first guy who dies have to be black?
[17:39:15] <sammych> which movie?
[17:45:33] <Xliff> sammych: The Last Ship on TNT
[17:45:37] <Xliff> TV Series
[17:52:06] <djQuery_> Dont you love it when they say Must Have 8 years experience in Node.js
[17:52:16] <Xliff> LOL
[17:52:40] <Xliff> Brought to you by: recruiters who don't know shit!
[17:52:56] <pcfreak30> So anyone help with this? http://pastie.org/private/r72tjqkstbw6jmbcbphoq
[17:53:04] <djQuery_> So something thats only been outa couple and you want what
[17:53:35] <Xliff> djQuery_: No one will have that much experience until 2017... even the developers!
[17:54:01] <Xliff> pcfreak30: Are there any styles defined for that element when the page loads?
[17:54:03] <djQuery_> pcfreak30, do you have jquery.ui loaded
[17:54:32] <pcfreak30> considering i can do it in console jquery is loading, no need for dummy questions
[17:54:39] <pcfreak30> css works but animate doesnt
[17:54:44] <djQuery_> pcfreak30, somethings animate cant handle till you add jquery.ui.animate
[17:54:53] <djQuery_> like color
[17:55:11] <Xliff> Er...
[17:55:14] <pcfreak30> so animate requires jqui?
[17:55:15] <Xliff> li ul?
[17:55:28] <pcfreak30> Xliff: nested list
[17:55:28] <Xliff> Shouldn't it be other way around?
[17:55:38] <pcfreak30> No.
[17:55:40] <djQuery_> pcfreak30, no advanced animate requires jquery.ui.animate
[17:55:51] <Xliff> OK. Without DOM example, I don't know that, so I HAVE to ask dumb assed questions like that one to establish baseline.
[17:55:57] <djQuery_> which has no dependencies on jquery.ui
[17:56:25] <pcfreak30> Xliff: I understand. I thought it would be implied if one works and the other doesnt
[17:56:31] <pcfreak30> Its just a shadow on hover
[17:56:40] <djQuery_> not good with CSS   #888 is a color correct?
[17:56:41] <Xliff> Without DOM example, I can't assume anything.
[17:57:10] <pcfreak30> Xliff: http://beta.simplydigitalhosting.com/
[17:57:34] <pcfreak30> its the pricing tables
[17:59:01] <djQuery_> pcfreak30, try taking the color out of it does it work?
[17:59:56] <pcfreak30> djQuery_: no dom css isnt changed
[18:00:44] <djQuery_> pcfreak30, like that paralax efect
[18:01:15] <pcfreak30> huh?
[18:02:34] <sammych> Required: 5 years experience in Swift.
[18:02:41] <sammych> ho ho ho
[18:03:07] <sammych> how does 22 days sound?
[18:05:40] <djQuery_> if I could just find someone that only wanted me to do javascript\jquery
[18:05:52] <djQuery_> maybe a templating engine as well
[18:06:03] <djQuery_> as long as I dont have to make it look pretty
[18:08:14] <pcfreak30> thats the sad thing djQuery_ . Business owners are wanting an all-in-one person for their jobs to cut expenses
[18:08:52] <pcfreak30> When I was in community college, the classes were aimed at having me be both a designer and dev even though I suck at UX
[18:09:14] <djQuery_> pcfreak30, my thing is data design
[18:09:30] <Xliff> pcfreak30: I'm trying it on your page and animate is not working. It might have something to do with boxShadow.
[18:09:37] <Xliff> Requires jQuery 1.8+ -> http://www.bitstorm.org/jquery/shadow-animation/
[18:09:43] <djQuery_> used to have fun with my old boss spitting out data models faster than the customer could request new stuff
[18:10:35] <Xliff> pcfreak30: Employers can't be that lucky these days. I'm one of those jack-of-all-trades fellows and they aren't willing to pay squat for that kind of experience.
[18:11:32] <pcfreak30> im on jq 1.11
[18:11:43] <Xliff> OK
[18:12:01] <djQuery_> pcfreak30, hmmmm even with jqueryui it doesn't seem to work http://jsbin.com/bulahu/1/edit
[18:12:03] <Xliff> Try loading that plugin and see if it helps. I see you are on wordpress, so that may take some doing.
[18:12:24] <Xliff> djQuery_: I don't think 1.11's animate supports the boxShadow property without some help.
[18:12:42] <pcfreak30> pluginI already have a copy of jq ui
[18:12:55] <pcfreak30> working on getting it to be enqurued
[18:13:09] <djQuery_> Xliff, heck my example was using the newest
[18:13:18] <Xliff> Same here.
[18:14:05] <Xliff> http://jsfiddle.net/EFM2j/ <-- works
[18:16:14] <Xliff> http://jsfiddle.net/EFM2j/2/ <- This one you can see the transition.
[18:17:31] <djQuery_> Xliff, you still had to use the plugin though
[18:19:16] <djQuery_> http://jsfiddle.net/Z8E5U/
[18:19:53] <Xliff> djQuery_: Show off.
[18:20:06] <djQuery_> Xliff, nope copy paste
[18:20:12] <Xliff> (nice tho.... of course how many browsers support CSS3 transitions)
[18:20:42] <djQuery_> Xliff, http://caniuse.com/css-animation
[18:22:15] <Xliff> So... all current browsers aside from Opera Mini (shame!)
[18:22:23] <djQuery_> Xliff, looks like everything except <10 IE and opera mini
[18:22:30] <Xliff> But IE9 is still b0rked. Guess how many companies will balk at no IE9 support.
[18:22:47] <Xliff> s/companies/managers/
[18:22:48] <djQuery_> Xliff, dont show them that
[18:22:54] <Xliff> :P
[18:23:01] <Xliff> Not me. Talk to pcfreak30!
[18:23:59] <pcfreak30> i think the day ie gets in line the web will crash
[18:24:20] <djQuery_> my old boss learned that when I said NO I ment that I didnt want to do it
[18:24:32] <djQuery_> not that it couldnt be done
[18:24:50] <Xliff> Ooh!
[18:24:53] <Xliff> TEEN WOLF!
[18:24:56] <Xliff> yAY!
[18:25:00] <djQuery_> wtf?
[18:25:08] <Xliff> Sorry. OT
[18:27:02] <pcfreak30> djQuery_, Xliff it seems even with jqui loaded it fails
[18:27:17] <Xliff> pcfreak30: Try the script I mentioned.
[18:27:38] <Xliff> Scroll back to 21:09
[18:27:54] <Xliff> And take note of the working fiddles that I posted.
[18:28:13] <djQuery_> or just say screw ie and use css animations
[18:28:21] <Xliff> Heh. Could do that.
[18:28:31] <asd_cuatro> hi!
[18:28:45] <djQuery_> asd_cuatro, will you be my friend
[18:28:50] <asd_cuatro> somebody have experience in dompdf jquery and ajax?
[18:28:52] <Xliff> pcfreak30: Yes, and then notice djQuery's desire to be awesome and use CSS3 transitions
[18:29:02] * Xliff sees PDF and runs.
[18:29:13] <Xliff> jquery and ajax, yes.
[18:29:16] <djQuery_> ?ask@asd_cautro
[18:29:23] <djQuery_> ?ask @asd_cautro
[18:29:23] <b-ot> asd_cautro: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[18:29:28] <pcfreak30> I think css3 animation is overkill here
[18:29:34] <asd_cuatro> ok
[18:29:54] <Xliff> djQuery_: HA! You see that? Overkill!
[18:30:04] <Xliff> =)
[18:30:15] <asd_cuatro> look i have a function with jquery that extract the HTML from a div
[18:30:31] <asd_cuatro> and send that string via POST
[18:30:36] <asd_cuatro> wait
[18:31:35] <asd_cuatro> ok and i make a variable dompdf and that receive the html and
[18:32:08] <asd_cuatro> but not save the pdf file
[18:32:40] <djQuery_> ?demo @asd_cuatro
[18:32:40] <b-ot> asd_cuatro: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:32:53] <asd_cuatro> :/
[18:32:53] <Xliff> "?demo"
[18:32:54] <djQuery_> asd_cuatro, if possible
[18:32:59] <Xliff> Oh, I must remember that.
[18:33:02] <asd_cuatro> dmn
[18:33:21] <asd_cuatro> jsfliddle
[18:33:23] <asd_cuatro> php?
[18:33:40] <Xliff> If your issue is with PHP, then you need to go to #php, not here.
[18:33:46] <asd_cuatro> ok
[18:33:48] <djQuery_> asd_cuatro, are you having problems with the php or the jquery part?
[18:33:54] <asd_cuatro> wait
[18:34:26] <Xliff> One thing to check. Make sure your POST is getting populated on the server side. If it is not, then it is jQuery. If it is, look in your PHP.
[18:34:39] <asd_cuatro> yes
[18:34:42] <asd_cuatro> the post is ok
[18:34:59] <Xliff> Then it's a dompdf issue which is PHP and not jQuery.
[18:35:01] <asd_cuatro> just that return the pdf file for js console
[18:35:48] <asd_cuatro> but
[18:36:00] <asd_cuatro> if i echo some thing like 'hello'
[18:36:18] <asd_cuatro> that is returned by the js console , exceuse my english
[18:36:55] <Xliff> asd_cuatro: Link up your problem page or post the code in jsfiddle.
[18:37:10] <Xliff> This way we have less ambiguities and confusion.
[18:37:20] <asd_cuatro> ok
[18:38:37] <sammych> anyone wanna tell me why we need the prefixes for things like class names
[18:38:51] <sammych> com.orgName.blah.foo.bar
[18:39:14] <sammych> is it just convention, a type of scoping/grouping
[18:40:38] <__joshua___> yeah.  my csslinter complains, but i find it very very handy for switching display states
[18:40:53] <__joshua___> and for making hooks for test runners
[18:41:47] <Xliff> Class names and periods don't mix
[18:41:57] <Xliff> s/Class/CSS class/
[18:42:01] <sammych> sorry, not class names
[18:42:07] <sammych> not in particular at least
[18:42:17] <sammych> just the general practice, whereever that gets used
[18:42:28] <Xliff> Java uses it.
[18:42:29] <__joshua___> wait, what do you mean?
[18:42:51] <sammych> java, yes
[18:42:53] <Xliff> And there I can see a point. It's convention there, but a useful one.
[18:43:11] <sammych> but in OS X, preference files are named as such
[18:43:20] <Xliff> *sigh*
[18:44:00] <djQuery_> sammych, so that I can create something called btnclick and you can create something called btnclick  and refer to mine as djQuery.btnclick without yours tromping all over mine
[18:44:04] <__joshua___> are you just talking about a prefixing '.' in general?
[18:44:20] <sammych> I'm reading the material on my cert, and it says 'you must use a "com, edu..." before your class name'
[18:44:21] <sammych> sorry
[18:44:29] <__joshua___> djQuery: well, thats event namespacing
[18:44:40] <sammych> this is just a general computing question, not 'class' as in CSS classes
[18:44:53] <__joshua___> oh no its not.  we all on different pages
[18:44:57] <__joshua___> ;p
[18:45:37] <djQuery_> sammych, which cert?
[18:45:47] <sammych> ibm worklight
[18:46:09] <Xliff> IBM is into that whole "if it works for Java it should work EVERYWHERE" mindset.
[18:46:28] <sammych> this was specifically for a java class, though
[18:46:40] <sammych> but I've seen it elsewhere, ie OS X
[18:49:43] <pcfreak30> Xliff: djQuery_ , i have that shadow plugin loaded
[18:49:50] <pcfreak30> nothing :/
[18:56:00] <thefulldesign> hey guys, what do i need to google or learn to do this: i want to be able to press the arrow key to get to the next page instead of the traditional nav bar, is this jquery or what?
[18:56:34] <Xliff> pcfreak30: Damn.
[18:57:23] <Xliff> pcfreak30: Are you sure. I don't see that on your page.
[18:57:35] <pcfreak30> Xliff: clear cache check source
[18:57:50] <pcfreak30> thefulldesign: where is the link/url of the next page at
[18:57:59] <pcfreak30> hard coded or pulled from somewhere?
[18:58:37] <pcfreak30> thefulldesign: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4104158/jquery-keypress-left-right-navigation
[18:59:03] <pcfreak30> use that, but instead of animating, you have it go to a diferent page via window.location.href
[18:59:15] <pcfreak30> left and right are there
[18:59:30] <thefulldesign> i do not think there's any wp themes for this, even though i think it's a pretty basic design, ill go check that out
[18:59:49] <pcfreak30> Xliff: <script type='text/javascript' src='http://beta.simplydigitalhosting.com/wp-content/themes/ultimate-hosting/assets/js/vendor/jquery.animate-shadow-min.js'></script>
[19:00:08] <pcfreak30> thefulldesign: who said anything about a wp theme?
[19:07:18] <Xliff> pcfreak30: You are using the minimized version. Can you try and use the non-minified one?
[19:07:28] <Xliff> I find minimized scripts and wordpress do not mix well.
[19:10:17] <pcfreak30> O_o
[19:10:25] <thefulldesign> my computer crash on me again.. can i get that link again?
[19:10:27] <pcfreak30> I just ran the whole script in console
[19:10:48] <Xliff> <pcfreak30> thefulldesign: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4104158/jquery-keypress-left-right-navigation
[19:10:56] <Xliff> pcfreak30: And?
[19:11:21] <pcfreak30> the non minified worked in console
[19:11:35] <Xliff> HAH!
[19:12:46] <thefulldesign> heyy im really confused as to why most sites dont have this, its really basic
[19:12:49] <thefulldesign> tap to next item
[19:13:06] <thefulldesign> any main or really bad disadvantage to this?
[19:13:46] <thefulldesign> not even stackoverflow has this
[19:14:14] <Fall> I guess some sites think about user experience more than others.
[19:14:47] <thefulldesign> that's what im saying, why aren't they, wikipedia also doesnt have it
[19:14:56] <thefulldesign> i think only the good site like quora does
[19:15:16] <thefulldesign> and facebook paper has this concept and it was innovative, and i thought it was obvious and really basic
[19:15:35] <thefulldesign> is implementation hard or something...
[19:15:38] <thefulldesign> i dont get it
[19:16:32] <pcfreak30> WOOT
[19:16:48] <pcfreak30> finally got that pesky feature going
[19:17:35] <pcfreak30> Xliff: Turns our I had format before commit in phpstorm which was screwing with the code i think
[19:19:01] <Xliff> pcfreak30: phpstorm?
[19:19:07] <Xliff> Well, if it works, it works.
[19:19:15] * Xliff hi5's pcfreak30.
[19:19:15] <pcfreak30> Xliff: yes code ide
[19:19:46] <pcfreak30> Thanks for your timr Xliff
[19:19:50] <pcfreak30> time
[19:19:57] <thefulldesign> here q has it for updates http://www.q.com/Q-Shortcuts -- http://www.q.com/Q-Keyboard-Shortcuts
[19:20:13] <thefulldesign> its super basic all sites should have it im really confused why so few, esp major sites dont have it (scrolling down to get more content is not an excuse why no1 is doing this tap thing) -- the scroll down to get content way sucks thats why i was thinking about this, but i realised it was really basic
[19:20:26] <Xliff> pcfreak30: np
[19:20:40] <thefulldesign> i think i first saw it on photo sites, but why just photos... i want videos & text & everything, & that's what i would do.... -- when facebook paper came out, ppl praised it for the design, but again, i thought this was just obvious and basic
[19:21:44] <pcfreak30> thefulldesign: one persons treasure is another's vision
[19:23:11] <thefulldesign> im just REALLY really confused as to why most sites, especially major ones dont have it, i have to use my mouse all the time, why cant i just press button, and go to next page, or item or w/e, you have leap motion, NUIs and all these great things, i dont get why i keep having to use my mouse whne not needed.... i dont know whats going on... i have to assume its so hard to do, but i dont think thats the case
[19:23:46] <thefulldesign> quora has it, games has it, but everything else, whats going on.. its just so basic...
[19:25:03] <pcfreak30> thefulldesign: you cant use arrow keys in a complex navigation
[19:26:37] <thefulldesign> im talking about next page, how about google, they dont have it, i need to click on #2, any good reasons they dont have it
[19:26:47] <thefulldesign> is that complex nav to get to the next page?? i dunno
[19:26:58] <thefulldesign> i dont think it is?...
[19:27:07] <Velveeta> define "next page"
[19:27:11] <thefulldesign> i need to eitehr click on scroll (since i have the chrome ext)
[19:27:16] <Velveeta> do you mean down the page some? or do you mean a separate page?
[19:27:18] <thefulldesign> #2 is the next
[19:27:24] <thefulldesign> the page after the current
[19:27:26] <thefulldesign> that is next
[19:27:39] <Velveeta> i'm just coming into this conversation, so i have no clue what you're talking about
[19:27:48] <pcfreak30> thefulldesign: it is more complex than you make it to be
[19:27:50] <Velveeta> except to see you constantly saying i don't know why all sites don't have this, it seems basic, next page
[19:28:05] <pcfreak30> As the fact stands you need to define what page is the next page
[19:28:14] <pcfreak30> and where that link is at
[19:28:20] <thefulldesign> how can going to the next photo or page be that complex, if photo sites can do it, i dont understand why other things cant
[19:28:27] <pcfreak30> if its pagination, is doable
[19:28:32] <Velveeta> i tried that Q link you posted, and i have no keyboard functionality except the down arrorw
[19:28:34] <Velveeta> arrow*
[19:28:37] <thefulldesign> you can do it on gmail
[19:28:38] <pcfreak30> bt if its like a multi-dropdown mwnu, forget iy
[19:28:42] <thefulldesign> so no i dont think its actually complex
[19:28:57] <Velveeta> you're talking about keyboard navigating workflows, not keyboard navigation
[19:29:10] <Velveeta> one has to define a workflow for that, and not all sites have definable workflows from their landing pages
[19:29:27] <pcfreak30> If you have somthing like a table
[19:29:31] <thefulldesign> im just talking about firstly 'press button to do something simple' like on gmail quora and others
[19:29:33] <pcfreak30> with page 2, 3, 4 etc
[19:29:40] <pcfreak30> then yes it coyld be done
[19:29:47] <thefulldesign> im talking about sites taht can have it but dont
[19:29:59] <pcfreak30> But is a per site basis on how navigation works
[19:30:06] <thefulldesign> there's a reason and its not cos its complex, it can be done easeily probably
[19:30:11] <Velveeta> right, there's no one-size-fits-all solution for that, it's very implementation specific
[19:30:20] <Velveeta> that's why i say you have to be able to define a workflow to arrow through
[19:30:41] <Velveeta> the reason it's not done is because it's not perceived as a high enough value add to waste developer time implementing
[19:30:53] <pcfreak30> Its not like you can use a greasemonkey script and have it work on every website
[19:30:57] <Velveeta> at any given time, those sites you point out are large sites with lots of features waiting on the back burner
[19:31:16] <Velveeta> those features all have priorities assigned to them, and every single one of those outranks keyboard navigating workflows, i can guarantee you
[19:31:21] <Velveeta> or else that feature would be in place
[19:31:49] <Velveeta> sites like gmail have those because gmail itself is a very workflow-centric model
[19:32:04] <thefulldesign> " not perceived as a high enough value add to waste developer time " -- gmail has it, its high value, google should have it and everythign else, it probably just takes a sec to do, i think it's jsut cos ppl are outdated, this is at least 4 years behinds what should be
[19:32:19] <Velveeta> that *was* a value add for them because it greatly speeds up the ability of people to use their product to save themselves time, multiplied by countless numbers of people that are looking to save time in just that way
[19:32:25] <thefulldesign> thats what i think, ppl dont like change so we hae to click shitt all the time, sigh
[19:32:36] <Velveeta> yes, people are outdated, that's the problem
[19:32:44] <Velveeta> because it would only take a second to put in
[19:32:47] <Velveeta> so here's what you do
[19:33:02] <Velveeta> go write the code for each individual company, should only take you a second, and send it to them with a GPL license
[19:33:11] <Velveeta> problem solved
[19:33:18] <thefulldesign> i dont even think they have a main theme for this -- http://themeforest.net/ -- they jsut have the generic formats, life is so hard.... :/
[19:33:47] <Velveeta> if at this point in the lifecycle of the internet, life is so hard, you're internetting wrong
[19:34:37] <pcfreak30> haha
[19:35:02] <thefulldesign> i completely disagree that it takes lots of time, cos TONS of chrome extenstions have many many shortcuts, all im asking is one button to the next page or w/e, it could be done nad is missing on so many sites :/....
[19:35:32] <pcfreak30> thefulldesign: if you want something done right, you gotta go it yourself
[19:36:02] <Velveeta> damn skippy
[19:36:31] <Velveeta> also, you must never have worked for a company where things were prioritized based on business goals, i'm assuming
[19:36:47] <Velveeta> as you seem to think that every site should have this built in, no matter what, that *this* is the one sole feature that all sites fail without
[19:37:30] <pcfreak30> thefulldesign: If you REALLY want to see this, write the code and github it for every company.
[19:37:38] <Velveeta> and anybody that says "can somebody teach me how to...... it can't be that hard.." obviously has no idea what goes into making anything work the way it works, so has no position to say "all im asking is one button to the next page or w/e, it could be done"
[19:38:12] <pcfreak30> Thats the big issue between designers vs devs
[19:38:17] <Velveeta> right
[19:38:24] <pcfreak30> designers think if a concept is simple
[19:38:32] <pcfreak30> the implementation is simple
[19:38:46] <Velveeta> i don't know how many times i've had to take things back to a designer to tell them that what they perceive as a trivial change is, in many cases, anything but
[19:38:47] <tw2113> for a moment i thought i was in #wordpress and was like " Velveeta, what are you doing in here? "
[19:38:50] <Xliff> Velveeta: And no idea how something as "simple" as cross browser compatibility can be so difficult... or impossible.
[19:39:21] <tw2113> yay cross browser stuff!
[19:39:37] <Velveeta> there is no browser, only zuul
[19:39:37] <pcfreak30> ie should just burn
[19:39:44] <pcfreak30> then that term would never be needed
[19:39:53] <Xliff> Velveeta: Bet you the XUL browser would work better than IE! ;)
[19:40:01] <Velveeta> heheheh
[19:40:04] <Xliff> (misspelling intentional)
[19:40:16] <Velveeta> internal pronunciation identical ;)
[19:40:22] <Xliff> =)
[19:40:47] <Velveeta> i'm not so ashamed of IE anymore, i just wish the legacy stragglers would get on the evergreen bandwagon
[19:40:57] <tw2113> Velveeta, https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/751021824/hB63050E9/
[19:41:10] <Velveeta> fluffy skurry
[19:41:26] <Xliff> IE will be fine when IE14 is out, has behaved itself as far as standards are concerned (yea, right -- it's Microsoft!) and IE10 is near it's deathbead.
[19:41:33] <Xliff> s/deathbead/deathbed/
[19:41:54] * Velveeta makes a deathbead deathship bracelet and hands it to Xliff.
[19:42:09] <Velveeta> best deaths 4ever!
[19:42:15] * Xliff snatches it away, greedily.
[19:42:23] <tw2113> i wonder who will overtake Google first?Microsoft or Mozilla
[19:42:25] <Xliff> DFFs!
[19:42:36] <Velveeta> i would be fucking ecstatic if we could get our customers onto IE10
[19:42:44] <Velveeta> then i could start playing with polymer in production :D
[19:42:51] <Xliff> Yeah. But all those managers want IE9.
[19:42:57] <Xliff> God forbid they want to go back to IE8.
[19:43:04] <tw2113> company i work for is close to ditching IE8
[19:43:05] <Velveeta> i have to support 8+
[19:43:14] <Xliff> Back when I was doing much of this work, it was IE7
[19:43:20] <tw2113> but we'd prefer 10 so our designers could use flexbox
[19:43:46] <Xliff> If I had to do that again, I would roll over on my back in front of fluffy and let her have her way with me.
[19:43:46] <Velveeta> when i first started at my company, it was 6+.. we ditched 6 in the first 6-12 months, and then just recently ditched 7, but we'll be supporting 8 for a while still
[19:44:04] <pcfreak30> Velveeta: IMHO anyone preferring IE needs to get a brain scan
[19:44:12] <Velveeta> yeah, i'd love to be able to make use of flexbox.. it would make our mobile initiatives so much easier
[19:44:18] <Xliff> BTW - Is fluffy a cat or a dog...or is that cute just camoflage until it gets close enough to bite?
[19:44:36] <Velveeta> pcfreak30: i still recommend chrome for all of our customers, but that shit ain't gonna happen :D
[19:44:48] <tw2113> some just want to check stocks and email
[19:44:51] <pcfreak30> What isnt
[19:45:04] <Xliff> Velveeta: No. Managers will freak because it's not Microsoft, and "Microsoft just works! And all of our customers use Windows!"
[19:45:18] <Velveeta> the majority of our customers switching to chrome
[19:46:24] <Velveeta> i hate any company with the claim "it just works"
[19:46:31] <Velveeta> so i guess that's both MS and Apple
[19:46:35] <Xliff> Yeah, but business managers will go that extra mile (and missed deadlines) to support the 2% left on insane versions of IE
[19:46:38] <Velveeta> congrats, i just became a neckbeard
[19:46:52] <tw2113> polly want a cheese square?
[19:46:57] <djQuery_> Velveeta, I love it when html products says it just works
[19:47:09] <djQuery_> follow the frigin standard and it will
[19:47:11] <Xliff> <marketroid>Marketshare! Marketshare!</marketroid>
[19:47:23] <Velveeta> i love the commercials for the apple ecosystem, when they someone like making a flinging motion on their laptop, and it appearing up on appletv
[19:47:32] <djQuery_> oh it doesnt work on IE well we followed the standard
[19:47:48] <tw2113> T-Minus 4 minutes till pot pie! :D
[19:47:53] <Velveeta> i do that shit in meetings all the time just to point out the absurdity.. "ok, so if i understood that commercial right, i just have to do <flicks> this, nope.. hmm, this? <flicks> nope, not that either... it just works!"
[19:48:01] <Xliff> Velveeta: They just want their Minority Report.
[19:50:02] <djQuery_> I used to support a helpdesk product, well new version comes out 2 months after ie7   we had i bug for IT DONT WORK IN IE7 we had every enterprise customer attached and 1/3 the rest of them
[19:51:36] <pcfreak30> So the company had a panic attack as IE threw a hissy fit?
[19:52:04] <djQuery_> 6 months later they got it fixed
[19:52:48] <pcfreak30> so enterprise customers sad on their thumb for 6 months
[19:52:53] <pcfreak30> thats lost sales
[19:52:56] <pcfreak30> sat
[19:53:13] <djQuery_> yepp thats McAfee for ya
[19:53:33] <thefulldesign> yes http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/lines/1w7pl2/if_your_site_does_this_i_hate_you/
[19:53:34] <thefulldesign> & yes http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/lines/275s11/if_you_made_this_interface_i_just_want_to_tell/
[19:53:44] <djQuery_> sold our division to BMC 18 months later
[19:54:20] <djQuery_> thefulldesign, 404
[19:54:24] <Velveeta> thefulldesign: page not found, both url's
[19:54:53] <tw2113> thefulldesign, stop spreading those two around
[19:55:01] <tw2113> 2nd room i've seen them in
[19:55:25] <thefulldesign> fixed http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/1w7pl2/if_your_site_does_this_i_hate_you/
[19:55:46] <thefulldesign> fixed.. http://www.reddit.com/r/web_design/comments/275s11/if_you_created_this_interface_i_just_want_to_tell/ -- i have a word changer extension on here...
[19:56:18] <Velveeta> the first link is an example of a poorly implemented placeholder shim
[19:56:28] <Velveeta> the 2nd is indeed a terrible interface
[19:56:37] <tw2113> my fault
[19:56:41] <tw2113> *goes to hang himself*
[19:56:57] <Xliff> HP site SUCKS
[19:57:19] <Velveeta> +1
[19:57:44] <djQuery_> i realy get tired of clicking on a number field on my phone and not having the correct keyboard come up
[19:58:07] <Velveeta> right, not enough people make use of the new input types
[19:58:22] <djQuery_> IT DOESNT BREAK IE use it
[19:59:02] <Velveeta> or they don't think about it in terms of what the interface really needs at its most basic.. like a zip code field, so long as it's US-only, doesn't need any letters, no need to make it type="text", make that shit type="phone" and give the user a nice big keypad
[19:59:16] <Velveeta> er tel, whoops
[20:00:24] <Velveeta> <input type="kanji" value="weeeee!" />
[20:00:40] <Xliff> Velveeta: I know, right? I hate getting asked for a pin on a phone or tablet and not getting a numeric keypad!
[20:01:32] <Velveeta> it's because to most people, tel isn't the intuitive choice for a numeric field, you just have to get used to doing that
[20:02:31] <djQuery_> well how frigin intuative is <text type="number" />
[20:02:37] <Xliff> ^ THIS!
[20:03:47] <Velveeta> rightio
[20:04:03] <Velveeta> for a numeric field? how the hell am i supposed to remember that?
[20:04:17] <tw2113> Velveeta, check your PMS
[20:04:24] <tw2113> s/PMS/PMs
[20:04:32] <Xliff> *snerk*
[20:04:44] <djQuery_> Velveeta, well I actualy have had some issues with it not working when I want to enter decimals on some phones.
[20:04:53] <Xliff> OK. Going back to crisis.binge.watching.
[20:05:22] <djQuery_> the frigin keyboard that some samsungs bring up doesnt have a frigin decimal or negative sign
[20:11:41] <pcfreak30> Offtopic: I tend to have issues with sleep and being nocturnal. Any advice to force myself to sleep so I am a day walker again P
[20:12:04] <Xliff> pcfreak30: Chemical assistance.
[20:12:04] <djQuery_>  pcfreak30 what time do you have your last cafine
[20:12:11] <djQuery_> get a night job
[20:12:24] <djQuery_> pcfreak30, no cafine after 5
[20:12:31] <Xliff> pcfreak30: djQuery has a point. Limit your caffine intake. Try not to drink ANY after 8pm
[20:12:39] <Xliff> 5pm is better.
[20:12:50] <tw2113> coffee is 2/3rds of my personality
[20:13:10] <pcfreak30> djQuery_: past some soda and choclate milk, no coffee
[20:13:10] * djQuery_ gets a Dr. Pepper from fridge
[20:13:34] <Xliff> pcfreak30: Drop the soda, keep the milk. Try to limit the chocolate.
[20:13:51] <pcfreak30> i tend to be a junk food eater
[20:14:00] <djQuery_> soda has a lotta cafine, and oh that sugar rush from choclate milk right before bed
[20:14:03] <tw2113> i think that's most of america
[20:14:16] <pcfreak30> im at the point in life i can folf anything down without consequences on my body :P
[20:14:22] <Xliff> pcfreak30: Limit the junk food after 5-6pm
[20:14:24] <pcfreak30> wolf
[20:14:29] <djQuery_> oh and lower the brightness on your monitor, the bright light makes you body think its still daylight
[20:14:55] <Velveeta> also, drink yourself to sleep
[20:15:04] <Xliff> pcfreak30: If you don't feel tired when you are ready for bed. Get into bed and read a book until you do.
[20:15:08] <Velveeta> about a half bottle of whiskey is a pretty good primer
[20:15:25] <tw2113> 2 beers tends to put me out for sleep stuff
[20:15:28] <pcfreak30> Velveeta: except I dont drink ever
[20:15:32] <Xliff> Velveeta: Sometimes. You have to know what to drink and when to stop.
[20:15:38] <Velveeta> then it'll probably take even less!
[20:15:39] <tw2113> if i can survive that, i'll be awake a little while longer
[20:19:07] <Jadenn> bah. i can't for the life of me figure out why jquery's wont listen to hover events on this element: http://paste.arviksa.co.uk/makedicebifiguka
[20:19:38] <Jadenn> i've tried logging in the selector, but its not getting any mouse events for that element
[20:20:08] <Jadenn> i thought it might be due to its z-index, or its absolute positioning, but i can select the text in the element just fine
[20:24:35] <Velveeta> jodenn: is that just a paste site like pastebin?
[20:25:01] <Velveeta> jadenn: sorry, this font threw me off
[20:25:25] <Jadenn> yeah, little project my friend whipped up in node last year
[20:25:44] <Velveeta> well, what i mean is, there's no interactivity to it, so we can't see why it's not working with just a code paste
[20:25:49] <tw2113> doesn't the jsfiddle original creator work for Mozilla these days?
[20:25:55] <Velveeta> can you put together a demo on jsbin or jsfiddle?
[20:26:16] <Jadenn> ill attempt to, but the code is well rooted into my application
[20:26:39] <Velveeta> well we don't need the entire application up there
[20:26:48] <Velveeta> just a snippet of markup that this pertains to, and that little code block
[20:27:34] <Velveeta> also, does that code block live inside a document.ready wrapper? and/or is that chatmessage class node something dynamically injected into the document? either via an ajax request or only when some event happens?
[20:27:58] <Jadenn> wow i totally forgot about that. thanks for reminding me
[20:28:06] <Jadenn> the chatmessage elements are dynamically inserte
[20:28:14] <Jadenn> forgot i need to use live or whatever
[20:28:20] <Jadenn> thanks :P
[20:28:36] <Velveeta> right, and the modern methodology is to use .on for all event binding, vs using .bind/.delegate/.live
[20:28:42] <Jadenn> on, sorryt
[20:28:46] <Jadenn> i forgot which one it was lol
[20:29:14] <Jadenn> i do php normally, but i've been jumping right into javascript this year
[20:51:40] <ravenzz> the only valid namespace delimiter is the dot, right?
[20:56:00] <djQuery_> ravenzz, yes
[20:56:08] <djQuery_> wasssup ravenzz
[20:56:41] <ravenzz> cool
[20:57:23] <ravenzz> djQuery_: it's been a while since the last time I saw you here :p
[20:57:33] <ravenzz> or maybe I've been too busy
[20:59:34] <djQuery_> http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/?autoplay=0&trail=0&grid=1&colors=1&zoom=1&s=random
[20:59:55] <djQuery_> forget who was doing game of life earlier but this is cool
[21:00:07] <ravenzz> nice
[21:08:03] <Xliff> djQuery_: that would be erming
[21:08:16] <djQuery_> erming, http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/?autoplay=0&trail=0&grid=1&colors=1&zoom=1&s=random
[21:08:43] <Xliff> I think he's sleeping.
[21:08:59] <djQuery_> Xliff, SLEEPING?
[21:09:01] <Xliff> This one is faster than his, though.
[21:09:20] <djQuery_> ?tell erming  http://pmav.eu/stuff/javascript-game-of-life-v3.1.1/?autoplay=0&trail=0&grid=1&colors=1&zoom=1&s=random
[21:09:20] <b-ot> djQuery_: I’ll tell erming about that.
[21:09:32] <Xliff> 16:48 <erming> i'll have to sleep.. o/
[21:09:44] <Xliff> That is, though.
[21:09:49] <djQuery_> Xliff, he will se it in the morning then
[21:09:52] <Xliff> The youtube vid blew my mind.
[21:09:58] <Xliff> Yes.
[21:10:04] <Xliff> And I will continue to binge watch crisis.
[21:10:11] <Xliff> Why this show got cancelled I don't know.
[21:10:28] <Xliff> It's not like other shows don't have the FBI being stupid.... *ahem* looking at you Blacklist!
[21:14:30] <Fall> lol
[21:14:32] <Fall> I dig Blacklist
[21:57:23] <Xliff> Fall: I do too! Totally love James Spader in that role. He's the -sole- reason that Blacklist got renewed and Crisis didn't.
[21:57:35] <Xliff> fscking HATE NBC.
[21:57:44] <Xliff> I liked both shows, ergo both should have gotten renewed!
[21:58:18] <Xliff> Of course that logic hasn't worked since Firefly. Still... <denial>I'm right and the world is wrong!</denial>
[21:59:00] * Xliff pokes djQuery_ .... 
[21:59:04] <Xliff> Still there, m8?
[21:59:29] <Xliff> (I'll be shocked if I get a response)
[22:00:19] <djQuery_> Xliff, what
[22:01:41] <Fall> Xliff: James Spade / Keifer Sutherland... I've followed them through shows. BL / BLacklist.. (ooh see what I did there?), Dark City, Touch, 24
[22:01:47] <Fall> Spader* oh my
[22:27:11] <Xliff> Fall: Same here!
[23:01:48] <checkit> Hey guys, I'm getting a Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function using the following code http://jsfiddle.net/E3Mkf/. Any thoughts?
[23:05:08] <Xliff> checkit: Weird. jQuery isn't being loaded.
[23:07:44] <Xliff> $ is getting resolved to moo-clientcide
[23:08:14] <checkit> I'm getting the same error on my local script.... No moo lib installed.
[23:09:42] <checkit> Xliff: How are you making that determination?
[23:09:55] <Xliff> Well, I'm looking at chrome console.
[23:10:07] <Xliff> When I look up $ function, I get this:
[23:10:15] <Xliff> function (el, nc){
[23:10:15] <Xliff> 	return document.id(el, nc, this.document);
[23:10:15] <Xliff> }
[23:10:19] <Xliff> Which is not jQuery
[23:10:34] <Xliff> The first time the fiddle has done this.
[23:11:02] <checkit> Haha... I don't think my code is really all that omnipotent.
[23:11:10] <Xliff> And it returns the file it was defined in: if (window.$ == null) Window.implement('$', function(el, nc){
[23:11:49] <Xliff> Oops: http://jsfiddle.net/js/moo-clientcide-1.3.js?nojobofferinsidebar
[23:12:10] <Xliff> I was doing jQuery code in fiddle earlier today and it wasn't doing that.
[23:13:08] <checkit> Xliff: Weird. Really weird. I'm getting this when I look up $ locally: function (e,t){return new x.fn.init(e,t,r)}
[23:13:26] <Xliff> That's jQuery
[23:14:32] <Cork> checkit: .live is removed in 1.9+
[23:14:56] <Xliff> Was that it?
[23:14:58] <Cork> use $(document).on('submit', '#participation_form', func) instead
[23:15:15] <checkit> Cork: Ohhhhh
[23:15:16] <Cork> also don't add tag names infront of ids
[23:15:29] <checkit> Cork: What's the downside to doing that?
[23:15:31] <Cork> you're slowing down the selector for no good reason
[23:16:17] <Cork> checkit: form#participation_form => 1. select all forms 2. in the list of forms select the one that matches the element in the id hash table
[23:16:33] <checkit> Cork: Gotcha. Thank you.
[23:16:35] <Cork> checkit: #participation_form => 1. select the element matching the id from the hash table
[23:17:24] <checkit> Copy that Cork. Thank you.
[23:17:32] <Cork> checkit: basically ids is unique, so there isn't ever any need to have any additional filters on it
[23:17:45] <checkit> That is true.
[23:18:41] <Cork> checkit: oh, right $(document).on('submit', '#participation_form', func) is the equiv of .live
[23:18:57] <Cork> checkit: but it supports a better use case
[23:18:58] <Xliff> http://jsfiddle.net/E3Mkf/4/ <- works
[23:19:15] <Cork> you can replace $(document) with a selector for a parent that isn't dynamically added
[23:19:21] <Xliff> Odd. Was jQuery not resolving when I was doing this earlier?
[23:19:58] <Cork> that way it doesn't have to add every event listener on document (it can be hard to clean up after your self)
[23:20:09] <checkit> Any  reason why the following is not a good use case: http://jsfiddle.net/E3Mkf/
[23:20:35] <Cork> checkit: .live has a broken syntax
[23:20:59] <checkit> Cork: I took it out. My last paste is using .on but slightly varied from the suggestions here.
[23:21:33] <Cork> what .live did internally was $(selector) => .live $(document).bind(event) { obj.selector ... })
[23:21:55] <Cork> so if you add functions after
[23:22:01] <Cork> it gets the wrong effect
[23:22:37] <Cork> so the syntax makes the developer think something happen when something completely different happens
[23:22:54] <Cork> while the delegate syntax doesn't have this problem
[23:26:26] <Xliff> http://jsfiddle.net/E3Mkf/5/ <- with parent div for delegation.
[23:27:48] <Xliff> So I have to do existence checking inside the jQuery that runs instead of relying on the console. Hrm.
[23:28:21] <Cork> Xliff: what?
[23:28:56] <Xliff> Cork: I'm in chrome, and when I go into the console, I can tell if the $ function has been redefined. I know what jQuery looks like.
[23:29:07] <Xliff> In jsFiddle, $ is redefined. The console can't see it.
[23:29:39] <Cork> Xliff: $ = jQuery;
[23:29:51] <Cork> problem solved
[23:30:07] <Xliff> jQuery object doesn't exist either. Checked that.
[23:30:18] <Cork> Xliff: are you talking about the host page?
[23:30:24] <Cork> sure it isn't written in jquery
[23:30:37] <Cork> http://fiddle.jshell.net/E3Mkf/5/show/ <-- this one does though
[23:31:12] <Xliff> Ho!
[23:31:14] <Xliff> Thanks for that tip
[23:31:54] <Cork> Xliff: the page is loaded in an iframe
[23:31:58] <Xliff> Cork: Yeah. After inspecting the hell out of the page, jQuery lives in an iframne.
[23:32:01] <Xliff> LOL
[23:32:03] <Cork> that is why you get that effect
[23:32:04] <Xliff> Beat me to it.
[23:34:41] <Xliff> Yeah, and console has trouble picking up elements from iframe.
[23:35:46] <Xliff> Oh! LOL! -- You can set the scope! Missed that.
[23:36:09] <Xliff> You da man, Cork. Thanks!
[23:36:34] <thebigkiwi> does anyone have a recommended parallax plugin?
[23:37:45] <K4T> http://pastebin.com/HiFtvwyW - How I can select button element inside click function?
[23:38:49] <Cork> K4T: $(this).closest('.btn-group').find('.btn.dropdown-toggle')
[23:39:29] <RockinAkin> is there a way that I can limit how high I can drag up a RANGE input?
[23:39:32] <RockinAkin> http://jsfiddle.net/zr68H/
[23:39:51] <K4T> Cork, thank you
[23:39:52] <RockinAkin> I have a range slider going from 0 to 10...  i want to not be able to drag it past 7
[23:40:14] <RockinAkin> without changing it's max of 10.
[23:40:36] <Cork> RockinAkin: not as far as i know
[23:40:55] <RockinAkin> really?  there must be a way to do this
[23:41:31] <Cork> RockinAkin: you might be able to do it by binding an event handler to it and forcing the value if it is higher
[23:41:43] <Cork> but no there isn't an option for it
[23:43:56] <RockinAkin> welll, I've tried using a if > 7,  value = 7,  but that still allows the user to drag it past 7.
[23:45:53] <RockinAkin> this should totally be doable with javascript / jquery, but I just haven't figured out HOW.
[23:46:28] <Cork> RockinAkin: wfm http://jsfiddle.net/76VcJ/
[23:53:33] <RockinAkin> who
[23:53:34] <RockinAkin> whoa
[23:53:40] <RockinAkin> why wasn't this working in my code
[23:53:46] <RockinAkin> hmm, awesome
