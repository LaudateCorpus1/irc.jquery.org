[12:17:35] <jak2000> hi all
[12:18:14] <jak2000> i do: $(".clDatosSupervisor").css('pointer-events','none');           for user cant type and/or move mouse.. right? how to enable for user can type and move the mouse? thanks
[12:23:52] <jak2000> $(".clDatosSupervisor").css('pointer-events','');  not work :(
[12:26:50] <robertparkerx> jak2000 have you tried 'unset' ?
[12:35:49] <jak2020> unset?
[12:35:50] <jak2020> how to use
[12:35:55] <jak2020> ?
[12:35:59] <robertmaxrees> "unset"?
[12:38:11] <jak2020> google say: $('#element').css('background-color', '');
[12:38:20] <jak2020> or: $('#element').css('background-color', 'inherit');
[12:38:44] <robertmaxrees> jak2020 are you asking how to "un-set" a css property?
[12:38:53] <jak2020> yes
[12:39:15] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/initial
[12:39:18] <robertmaxrees> use 'initial'
[12:43:50] <jak2000> ok thanks
[12:45:29] <jak2000> other thing.... in the Div that have: css property: $(".clDatosSupervisor").css('pointer-events','none');      i cant move the mouse or click or type anything, but when the user is on a input text where can type text, the user hit TAB and TAB and TAB ... and can change the values of the disabled div
[12:45:32] <jak2000> why?
[12:45:59] <robertmaxrees> "disabled div" meaning the div with pointer-events set to none?
[12:47:25] <robertmaxrees> jak2000
[12:49:43] <jak2000> yes and cant user type anything...
[12:49:58] <robertmaxrees> you just said they can tab into the input and type though, right?
[12:51:54] <robertmaxrees> jak2000
[12:52:21] <jak2000> yes
[12:52:32] <robertmaxrees> well, think about it.
[12:52:37] <robertmaxrees> tabbing isn't a pointer event.
[12:52:43] <robertmaxrees> that's from the keyboard.
[12:55:45] <jak2000> see pleasE: https://vimeo.com/382053722
[12:55:53] <robertmaxrees> that's going to be a video.
[12:55:56] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle, yo.
[12:56:02] <jak2000> fiddle
[12:56:36] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:56:49] <robertmaxrees> a video recording does me no good.
[12:58:31] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 here: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jctodp5w/
[12:58:38] <robertmaxrees> literally all you needed to make.
[12:59:48] <jak2000> yes
[13:00:01] <robertmaxrees> so like
[13:00:11] <robertmaxrees> hitting "tab" isn't a pointer-event.
[13:00:13] <jak2000> when user is on "start here"
[13:00:23] <jak2000> and type TAB hi can access to other input
[13:00:27] <jak2000> how to block?
[13:00:35] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to just disable all of those inputs?
[13:02:26] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 hello?
[13:05:53] <jak2000> manually?
[13:06:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:06:06] <robertmaxrees> that's a yes or no question.
[13:06:08] <jak2000> something like: $( ".clDatosSupervisor").prop("disabled", true );   ?
[13:06:25] <robertmaxrees> again - are you trying to just disable all of those inputs?
[13:06:33] <robertmaxrees> like, do you want to stop any user interaction whatsoever?
[13:06:44] <jak2000> yes
[13:06:53] <jak2000> i want disable any user interactin
[13:06:56] <jak2000> interaction
[13:07:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jctodp5w/6/
[13:08:22] <robertmaxrees> just create them with the 'disabled' attribute and call it a day.
[13:08:31] <robertmaxrees> can add/remove after the fact via .prop()
[13:08:51] <jak2000> ok thanks
[13:08:58] <jak2000> testing
[13:09:12] <robertmaxrees> do you understand why pointer-events: none; doesn't do what you want it do?
[13:10:47] <jak2000> now, yes thanks
[13:11:05] <jak2000> robertmaxrees other question (sorry if is offtopic) what do you think about vue?
[13:11:20] <robertmaxrees> it's a framework.
[13:11:32] <robertmaxrees> :shrug: that's a really open-ended question.
[16:03:34] <taplar> the view is super gosipy, imho
[16:04:50] <robertmaxrees> lel
[16:05:14] <bestdesign> what view?
[16:05:30] <robertmaxrees> he was making a joke about a question i was asked earlier.
[16:06:09] <bestdesign> :)
[16:07:45] <bestdesign> good
[16:08:00] <taplar> ?
[16:08:33] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees: how can check an if statement with setinterval? like 10 seconds?
[16:08:37] <bestdesign> is can do jquery?
[16:08:56] <robertmaxrees> 2 things: 1 - no reason to ask me directly.  just ask the channel.  if somebody can help, they will.
[16:09:10] <robertmaxrees> 2 - huh?  mind clarifying what you're actually doing?
[16:09:45] <bestdesign> like have an if state on document ready and check that without reload the page?
[16:10:02] <robertmaxrees> why?
[16:10:09] <taplar> repeat #2 question
[16:10:22] <robertmaxrees> ^ why would you want to do that?
[16:10:53] <taplar> the concepts of if statements and timeouts don't really have anything inheriently to do with jQuery
[16:11:12] <robertmaxrees> exactly.  and what is this 'if' checking?
[16:11:13] <bestdesign> i no idea then how to check
[16:11:18] <taplar> check what?
[16:11:33] <robertmaxrees> ^ like, what would the if statement look like?
[16:11:33] <bestdesign> robertmaxrees: is check the time like evening or morning to write
[16:12:00] <robertmaxrees> so you want to regularly check what time it is an then have the page do stuff?
[16:12:11] <robertmaxrees> based on current itme?
[16:12:14] <bestdesign> something like
[16:12:17] <bestdesign> yes
[16:12:20] <robertmaxrees> *time?
[16:12:26] <bestdesign> just for a text currently
[16:12:49] <robertmaxrees> then use a recursive setTimeout call
[16:13:01] <taplar> ^ in a document ready perhaps
[16:13:12] <bestdesign> like open page morning ->> morning, user and at evening change the text evening, user
[16:13:24] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[16:13:27] <robertmaxrees> recursive setTimeout call.
[16:13:48] <bestdesign> that can do it?
[16:13:50] <bestdesign> cool
[16:14:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:16:09] <bestdesign> http://jsfiddle.net/hn2e7ms9/
[16:16:11] <bestdesign> like this?
[16:16:27] <robertmaxrees> that's not an async process.
[16:16:34] <robertmaxrees> don't know why you'd call it that.
[16:16:59] <bestdesign> ah my bad
[16:17:06] <bestdesign> just call somehow
[16:17:47] <taplar> also, once you have the recursive timeout working, you should start looking into improving it to try to make it only timeout on the next hour
[16:18:01] <taplar> or timeout on whatever the next time is that would change the text
[16:18:13] <robertmaxrees> ^ this.
[16:18:29] <robertmaxrees> dynamically the set the length of the timeout would be smart.
[16:19:06] <robertmaxrees> also: move your selections out of there and store them in vars instead.
[16:19:21] <robertmaxrees> recursive timesouts can start to eat up memory if you're not careful.
[16:19:44] <robertmaxrees> the very simplest concept you want is going to be something like this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ufbwpzLs/
[16:25:25] <taplar> i need to google, but is there a way off of Date to just get 'am' or 'pm'? :D
[16:26:19] <taplar> aww, that may not be built in
[16:26:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah, don't think that exists.
[16:26:41] <robertmaxrees> easy enough to calculate imho
[16:26:57] <taplar> well i was just thinking if it was built in that'd be a nice shorthand check instead of the hours
[16:27:39] <robertmaxrees> except you would't be saying "good evening" at 2pm, or "good afternoon"
[16:27:44] <robertmaxrees> * at 9pm
[16:37:17] <grid-> hey
[16:37:32] <grid-> https://jsbin.com/qasucamato/1/edit?html,js,output
[16:37:55] <grid-> i want to set the input by it's nth child because i've got an api that uses no option to give the input's an id with them, what can do this?
[16:38:48] <robertmaxrees> grid- that's a strange thing to want to do.
[16:39:00] <grid-> robertmaxrees: there is a story behind it
[16:39:11] <robertmaxrees> also: your .filterhead elements are the parent TDs, not the inputs.
[16:39:22] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you want it by the nth <td>, then set the input.
[16:40:00] <grid-> robertmaxrees: you are exactly right
[16:40:10] <robertmaxrees> so do that.
[16:40:14] <grid-> i overlooked it
[16:40:17] <robertmaxrees> oh, and use .on()
[16:40:20] <robertmaxrees> to bind listeners.
[16:40:27] <grid-> $(".column_search").val("valuesgoeshere"); it is now
[16:40:50] <grid-> i want to set the it by a function
[16:40:58] <robertmaxrees> which is fine.
[16:41:07] <robertmaxrees> bind the listener using .on() instead of onclick in your html.
[16:41:25] <grid-> sure
[16:41:37] <grid-> http://live.datatables.net/fumuzuli/1/edit
[16:41:40] <grid-> this is the real test page
[16:43:25] <robertmaxrees> 'k?
[16:43:28] <grid-> robertmaxrees: i changed it a bit: http://live.datatables.net/womabexu/1/edit
[16:43:48] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[16:43:53] <grid-> line 37, can you identify the right nth child for position?
[16:44:07] <robertmaxrees> uh
[16:44:15] <robertmaxrees> you can cound it yourself? :)
[16:44:32] <robertmaxrees> it's going to be 0-indexed.
[16:44:41] <grid-> yes, i have chrome dev tools and mozilla
[16:44:46] <grid-> i can copy the css path etc
[16:44:50] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[16:44:55] <robertmaxrees> or you could just count it :)
[16:45:01] <grid-> but i don't know howto set it programmatically
[16:45:24] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/eq/
[16:46:41] <grid->   $(".column_search").eq( 1 ).val("Developer");
[16:46:57] <robertmaxrees> assuming .column_search is on the element you're trying to select.
[16:47:54] <grid-> http://live.datatables.net/renaruzi/1/edit
[16:48:11] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:48:19] <robertmaxrees> did you have a question?
[16:49:32] <grid-> no
[16:49:38] <robertmaxrees> alrighty :)
[16:49:39] <grid-> just to let you see what i did
[16:49:53] <robertmaxrees> onclick="myFunction()" - don't do this btw.
[16:49:56] <robertmaxrees> use .on() instead.
[16:50:47] <robertmaxrees> http://live.datatables.net/tevizasa/1/edit
[16:50:49] <grid-> yes, you mean with an id in the ahref or button atribute
[16:50:58] <robertmaxrees> use a class.
[16:51:00] <grid-> but the button is just for being an example
[16:51:02] <grid-> or class
[16:51:12] <robertmaxrees> "an id in the ahref or button attribute" wat
[16:52:01] <grid-> a click handler
[16:52:14] <robertmaxrees> that sentence makes literally no sense lol
[16:52:19] <robertmaxrees> but alright :)
[16:52:55] <grid-> 		$(".myclass").click(function(e) {
[16:52:55] <grid-> 		whateverhere();
[16:52:55] <grid-> 		return false;
[16:53:00] <grid-> this you mean?
[16:53:19] <robertmaxrees> i literally showed you in that last paste I gave :)
[16:53:36] <grid-> yes, i just saw it a couple of seconds ago
[16:53:50] <robertmaxrees> :) and use .on() for binding handlers.
[16:53:59] <robertmaxrees> instead of stuff like .click()
[16:57:10] <grid-> sure, brb :)\
