[02:20:11] <am_> Hi all. I try this: document.getElementById("some_text" + i).innerHTML = NewText[i]; -but it's not working? Error: Unable to set property InnerHTML of undefined or null reference. What I'm doing wrong?
[02:20:46] <robertmaxrees> hrm.  not using jquery?  i'd head to ##javascript in that case.
[02:20:55] <Cork> am_: the selector doesn't match an id
[02:21:07] <robertmaxrees> lol that too
[02:21:19] <Uhkis> -1 not enough jquery
[02:22:02] <am_> Cork: If I use "some_text1" шежы working
[02:22:06] <am_> it's
[02:22:23] <Cork> ran at the same place?
[02:22:41] <robertmaxrees> ^ also guessing you're doing a standard for loop, which starts on 0
[02:22:45] <Cork> cause "Unable to set property InnerHTML of undefined or null" means document.getElementById returns null
[02:23:04] <am_> hm
[02:23:07] <Cork> and that in turn means the selector matched nothing
[02:23:36] <Cork> also for document.getElementById you should normally store it in a variable and check it with if() {}
[02:23:45] <Cork> before modifying it
[02:23:46] <am_> Cork: you right!
[02:24:14] <am_> Error was in: for (var i = 0; i < chars.length+1; i++)
[02:24:21] <am_> It need to be set as var i = 1
[02:24:23] <am_> You right
[02:24:25] <am_> Thanks
[02:25:09] <Cork> would prob change i < chars.length+1 to i <= chars.length
[02:25:37] <Cork> or even better for(i = 1, length = chars.length; i <= length; i++)
[02:44:26] <am_> Cork thanks!
[03:10:33] <karstenk> In Line 194 I try to trigger the event function from line 138, but that doesnt work, any suggestions? https://paste.centos.org/view/a98a48f1
[04:00:21] <Cork> karstenk: already answered you in javascript...
[04:01:19] <Cork> except now you've changed the event type so they don't even match
