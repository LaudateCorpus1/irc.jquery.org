[08:55:28] <t2mkn> Can someone help or make me understand a bit with whats the problem in this code: https://bpaste.net/ZIYA
[08:55:57] <t2mkn> i am kind of new to js and jquery so
[09:38:12] <Cork> t2mkn: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS
[09:38:17] <Cork> ^ that will prevent you
[09:44:04] <t2mkn> any solution to that?
[09:47:45] <Cork> t2mkn: the server your connecting to can allow your domain to do cors connections
[09:47:52] <Cork> t2mkn: except for that, no
[09:48:12] <Cork> well, you can proxy the connection over your own server
[09:48:29] <Cork> then the cors problem goes away as it isn't the user doing the connection to the server
[09:51:07] <t2mkn> ok. but i tried with https://website.dev/login that should work right? but its not even sending the request.
[09:52:55] <t2mkn> e.preventDefault() is now at top. alert(working) after words working. means $.ajax is getting called. but no POST happening.
[09:56:36] <Cork> it should
[09:58:10] <t2mkn> this is in use https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js
[09:58:22] <t2mkn> hope thats not an issue.
[09:58:23] <Cork> ah
[09:58:28] <Cork> slim don't have ajax
[09:59:03] <t2mkn> üò≤
[09:59:19] <t2mkn> then which should be used?
[09:59:25] <Cork> the standard one
[09:59:31] <Cork> or "full"
[09:59:54] <t2mkn> oooo.
[10:00:02] <Cork> anyone that isn't slim
[10:00:17] <Cork> there is only two versions (different format but still)
[10:03:42] <t2mkn> haaa finally it's working. üòõ
[10:07:06] <t2mkn> fail(function(){ // how to get the cause of fail?  })
[10:08:45] <Cork> check the arguments sent to the function
[10:09:49] <Cork> you find the names used for them here https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/
[10:09:54] <Cork> under "error"
[10:10:23] <t2mkn> ya got it. its getting 400 error code.
[10:10:27] <t2mkn> server says:
[10:10:29] <t2mkn> WARNING:tornado.general:Invalid multipart/form-data: multipart boundary not found
[10:10:40] <Cork> ya, can't help you with that
[10:10:52] <Cork> or actually i can
[10:11:02] <Cork> yoru sending www-form-encoded and calling it multipart
[10:11:26] <Cork> you should prob just skip the contentType attribute
[10:11:51] <Cork> jquery will set the default one (www-form-encoded)
[10:12:11] <t2mkn> ok trying...
[10:14:01] <t2mkn> no error now. üëç
[10:55:01] <errorous> Hello. Is there a way to prevent adding event listerner to an element?
[13:31:24] <thykka> errorous, ..while still having it react to events?
[14:19:51] <AdamPDotty> My question would be "Why" not "How"
[18:35:19] <snatcher> is there a way to .delay() before .stop()? trying to stop current animation after 1000ms and then start new one, in this case $o.delay(1000).stop().animate(...); animation stopped before 1000ms delay
[18:35:47] <robertmaxrees> you need to start a queue for that to work.
[18:36:31] <robertmaxrees> or just use a normal setTimeout :)
[18:40:57] <robertmaxrees> snatcher ^
