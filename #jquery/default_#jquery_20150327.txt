[00:38:49] <d3m0n> I have a set of cookies all with the name data-*, * being a number. How would I check is any data-* is set?
[00:38:59] <d3m0n> Ie: Using a wild card to check
[00:39:18] <Cork> uh cookies and data?!?
[00:39:32] <Cork> do you really mean cookies?
[00:39:51] <d3m0n> Sorry, you lost me.
[00:39:59] <d3m0n> Yes, it's a cookie.
[00:40:05] <Cork> document.cookies is a string
[00:40:09] <Cork> just look in it
[00:40:19] <d3m0n> I am using a jquery plugin cookies
[00:40:25] <d3m0n> To store them
[00:40:38] <Cork> check the documentation for the plugin then
[00:40:50] <Cork> the answer is most likely "not supported"
[00:40:53] <d3m0n> Well my question was kind of outside of the plugin
[00:41:03] <Cork> outside the plugin you have a string
[00:41:06] <d3m0n> There's no way to run an each() or something on the cookies?
[00:41:12] <Cork> and you can regex match what ever you like there
[00:41:20] <d3m0n> The cookie names are the same except the number added at the end
[00:41:27] <d3m0n> data-1, data-2, data-3
[00:41:36] <Cork> like i've said, cookies is a strign
[00:41:41] <Cork> there isn't anything to loop
[00:41:46] <d3m0n> doh
[00:42:10] <Cork> regex match the text you want to work with
[00:43:23] <Cork> d3m0n: if you need help finding if the plugin supports something, you would have to link it
[00:43:45] <d3m0n> It's this one https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[00:44:44] <Cork> d3m0n: $.cookie() returns a has
[00:44:47] <Cork> you could loop that
[00:45:18] <Cork> sorry returns an object
[00:46:26] <d3m0n> Ahh ok, i'll check that out. THanks Cork

[01:22:18] <Woet> DragonPunch: and for future reference, instead of "this line is breaking me", quote the actual error.
[01:24:45] <DragonPunch> the quotes was the issue, thanks Woet and I don't have a great jQuery debugger

[02:14:42] <ahop> Can I ask a question?
[02:15:02] <Uhkis> you just did.
[02:15:14] <Cork> katching
[02:15:15] <ahop> that's true :)
[02:15:24] <ahop> I would like to transform each
[02:15:27] <ahop> <li class="blah"><span>texthere<span></li>   into
[02:15:27] <ahop> <li class="blah"><a href=index.php?texthere"><span>...<span></a></li>
[02:15:36] <Cork> ?wrap
[02:15:52] <Cork> <_<
[02:15:59] * Cork pokes b-ot
[02:16:01] <Uhkis> api..
[02:16:06] <Cork> right
[02:16:13] <ahop> $('.blah). ... what here?
[02:16:14] <Cork> ?api wrap
[02:16:14] <b-ot> Cork: .wrap(): Wrap an HTML structure around each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/wrap/
[02:16:39] <Cork> ahop: $('.blah span').wrap('<a...>')
[02:16:57] <ahop> oh thanks
[02:17:17] <ahop> but I need to use the text inside span  to make the href link
[02:17:34] <ahop> example: <li class="blah"><span>bonjour<span></li> should become
[02:17:39] <Cork> then to .each and use the wrap inside the loop
[02:17:47] <ahop> <li class="blah"><a href="index.php?bonjour"><span>bonjour<span></a></li>
[02:17:57] <Uhkis> or $('.blah span').text();
[02:18:08] <Cork> Uhkis: he still needs to add the a tag
[02:18:11] <ahop> argh... a wrap inside a each ?
[02:18:19] <ahop> oops I'm a bit lost
[02:18:53] <Cork> ahop: $('.blah span').each(function() { $(this).wrap('<a href="' + $(this).text() + '">') });
[02:19:01] <Uhkis> i meant like: $('.blah span').wrap('<a href="index.php?'+$('.blah span').text()+'>')
[02:19:14] <Cork> Uhkis: that won't work if there is more then one span
[02:19:20] <Uhkis> riight
[02:19:43] <Cork> and ya i assumed it was the case here
[02:19:46] <ahop> there is just one spam
[02:19:49] <ahop> sorry one span ;)
[02:19:56] <Cork> ah, then go with Uhkis's solution
[02:20:12] <Cork> though you might still want to use the each
[02:20:17] <Cork> as it means you can use $(this)=
[02:20:32] <Cork> so less dom lookups
[02:20:49] <Cork> (though it is one element so...)
[02:21:05] <ahop> sorry I explained wrong

[02:23:00] <ahop> sorry I missed to add jquery. Here it is : http://jsfiddle.net/q7fmatdk/1/
[02:23:03] <Cork> ya, that needs the each loop
[02:23:03] <ahop> but it doesn't work
[02:23:05] <Uhkis> yeah, you need each

[02:24:34] <kokut> Hello, how can i check if a particular element has a particular style property?
[02:24:59] <Cork> kokut: you should be using a class instead
[02:25:19] <Cork> you would have to loop the elements and check .css('property')
[02:25:29] <kokut> then it won't work
[02:25:46] <Cork> so use a class
[02:25:50] <ahop> Thanks a lot Cork !
[02:25:53] <ahop> it works :)
[02:26:09] <kokut> Cork: I can't
[02:26:20] <kokut> i need to check if style="transform: rotate(90deg);
[02:26:21] <Cork> so you can't loop the elements, and you can't use a clasS?
[02:26:34] <kokut> yep
[02:26:37] <kokut> its rotating
[02:26:38] <Cork> then you're out of luck
[02:26:49] <Cork> there isn't a third option
[02:26:58] <kokut> i was thinking $('element[style*="..."]'); or something
[02:27:49] <Cork> $('element').filter(function() { return $(this).css('transform') == ''; });
[02:28:00] <Cork> the loop i talked about ^
[02:28:50] <kokut> i shouldnt be looping through elements to check if an element is being rotated
[02:29:02] <Cork> yes
[02:29:07] <Cork> you should be using a class instead
[02:29:18] <Cork> but if you have to check the style property you have to
[02:29:21] <Cork> one way or another
[02:29:21] <kokut> a class like what?
[02:29:31] <Cork> set the transform in a css class
[02:29:40] <Cork> and check for the class in a normal selector
[02:30:32] <Cork> kokut: note that attribute selectors has to loop the elements, you just don't see it as that
[02:30:48] <Cork> and is why you should be careful with them cause it is a performans hog
[02:37:19] <kokut> Cork: $('.class').filter(function() { return $(this).css('transform') == 'rotate(90deg)'; }); is returning object [ ] all the time
[02:44:55] <kokut> Cork: lol i was on the cookies tab
[02:45:20] <kokut> Cork: now its returning the element even if $(this).css('transform') == 'rotate(90deg)'; is false
[02:45:44] <kokut> when i do it like var a = $('.class').filter(function() { return $(this).css('transform') == 'rotate(90deg)'; });
[02:46:05] <Cork> hmm ah, ya transform returns a matrix
[02:46:10] <Cork> forgot that
[02:47:26] <kokut> Cork: i just need to check if the element is being rotated so as not to start rotatign again and break the animation
[02:47:39] <ahop> Cork: a small something:
[02:47:50] <ahop> how to make that the Share box appears on top of everything else ? http://jsfiddle.net/7a3ttvcz/1/
[02:48:06] <Cork> kokut: using the style value for this is fundamentally a bad idea
[02:48:55] <Omar-> good morning
[02:48:59] <Uhkis> ahop: float: left;
[02:49:01] <kokut> mornin'

[02:49:57] <d3m0n> I am using JSON.stringify on an array. Will it chock on doule or single quotes in the array?
[02:50:05] <d3m0n> double*
[02:50:11] <ahop> Uhkis: no this would change the whole layout
[02:50:18] <Cork> d3m0n: yes it will escape the double quotes
[02:50:19] <Uhkis> ahop: http://jsfiddle.net/7a3ttvcz/3/
[02:50:36] <Cork> d3m0n: json is always double quotes so ya
[02:50:46] <ahop> Uhkis oh cool yes
[02:50:59] <ahop> but now I want the box to appear below the "Share" button
[02:51:03] <ahop> how?
[02:51:26] <ahop> I cant set an absolute x,y  in the CSS because it will change from one page to another
[02:51:28] <ahop> so this is not fixed
[02:51:53] <d3m0n> Cork: I am trying to store an array in a cookie by serializing the array first but the array contains html markup. Is stringify the wrong function to use?
[02:52:17] <Cork> d3m0n: you shouldn't use cookie for this
[02:52:30] <Cork> d3m0n: cookies is sent back and forth with every http request
[02:52:35] <Cork> including image requests
[02:52:45] <jop007> Hi when I use a function defined in document.ready the function is not found the function is an onclikc event
[02:52:52] <Cork> it is NOT good for storing random data
[02:53:00] <d3m0n> Cork: I really dont think this needs it's own database though.
[02:53:07] <jop007> must the on click event also included in document.ready?
[02:53:32] <Cork> d3m0n: you bloating every http request with the data, so the user has to pay money for it is better?
[02:53:37] <Cork> you mean*
[02:53:39] <d3m0n> LOL
[02:54:05] <Cork> so ya, use indexeddb or localstorage
[02:54:06] <jop007>   $('#add_location').click(function(e) {     create_insured_location();   });
[02:54:09] <Cork> not cookies
[02:54:23] <jop007> the create_insured_location is not found
[02:54:31] <d3m0n> Ok you got me there but to befair it won't be public and will be local.
[02:54:33] <Cork> d3m0n: cookies should be the data you want to send back and forth to identify a connection
[02:54:34] <jop007> but defined
[02:54:48] <Cork> d3m0n: is still a horrible idea
[02:54:54] <d3m0n> :'(
[02:55:02] <Uhkis> ahop: http://jsfiddle.net/7a3ttvcz/4/
[02:55:23] <d3m0n> Thanks for the info Cork. Might go with localstorage then

[02:56:57] <jop007> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1055767/why-can-i-not-define-functions-in-jquerys-document-ready
[02:57:15] <jop007> if I have 2 docuemnt.ready functions each has different scope
[02:57:25] <kokut> Cork: var a = $('.class').filter(function() { return $(this).css('transform') == 'rotate(90deg)'; }); is always returning something so i can't check if a.length, is there a way to make it return a boolean or something if it finds the element?
[02:57:29] <Cork> jop007: use window.functionName = function() {}
[02:57:45] <Cork> kokut: make a jsfiddle
[02:57:49] <Xatenev> Heya
[02:57:54] <Xatenev> fast question
[02:58:53] <Xatenev> I got a list (ul) with some elements inside it(input fields). can I loop through all checked checkboxes using .each?
[02:59:18] <Xatenev> I wanna create an element with .append() for each checkbox which is checked
[02:59:21] <Uhkis> yes
[02:59:22] <Xatenev> so I thought its the best using .each
[02:59:25] <Xatenev> How can i do that?^^
[03:00:14] <kokut> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/24dw2hvx/3/
[03:00:40] <d3m0n> Xatenev: $(':checked').each(function(){ $(this).append('hi')};
[03:01:46] <Cork> kokut: ya, that returns matrix(0, 1, -1, 0, 0, 0)
[03:02:09] <Cork> kokut: ok, back this up, what is it you need to do?
[03:02:24] <Cork> there has to be a less buggy and hacky solution for this
[03:02:56] <kokut> Cork: i need to check if the element is being rotated or not as to not call the rotation function again because it starts again and breaks the animation making it look bad
[03:03:11] <Cork> kokut: and the rotator function uses?
[03:03:15] <Cork> just .css() ?
[03:03:31] <Cork> or .animate
[03:03:35] <Cork> or what?
[03:03:46] <kokut> Cork: $.fn.animateRotate = function(angle, duration, easing, complete) {
[03:03:59] <Cork> that is the function definition
[03:04:01] <Cork> not what it does
[03:04:19] <Xatenev> d3m0n: thank you a lot
[03:04:23] <kokut> it uses .animate
[03:04:25] <Xatenev> it works very gud
[03:04:34] <ahop> Uhkis: it works well indeed!
[03:04:44] <ahop> Last thing on http://jsfiddle.net/7a3ttvcz/4/
[03:04:48] <Cork> so $('.fa-plus:animated') should work
[03:04:49] <d3m0n> Xatenev: You're welcom
[03:04:53] <d3m0n> Welcome*
[03:05:00] <ahop> How to make that anywhere I click outside the box, it should hide/close the box
[03:05:15] <ahop> ie the Share link box should close if I click anywhere
[03:05:19] <ahop> outside the box
[03:05:54] <Cork> ahop: bind a click handler on body and check if the click is inside the target
[03:06:17] <kokut> Cork: if ($('.fa-plus:animated')) is returning always true
[03:06:55] <Cork> kokut: uh $() always return an object
[03:07:08] <Cork> and yes objects are truthy
[03:07:14] <Cork> you need to check .length > 0
[03:07:23] <Cork> ahop: http://jsfiddle.net/7a3ttvcz/6/
[03:08:17] <ahop> thanks :)
[03:15:21] <jop007> in my document.ready I have this oelcollapse = $('#insured_sum');   oelcollapse.collapsible('option', 'collapsed', false); and I got this message oelcollapse = $('#insured_sum');   oelcollapse.collapsible('option', 'collapsed', false);
[03:17:48] <Xatenev> Actually the jquery channel is the best channel for help for a specific topic^^
[03:17:55] <Xatenev> u just get answers instantly :P
[03:18:21] <Cork> jop007: i think you pasted the wrong thing the last time
[03:18:32] <Cork> jop007: the question doesn't make sense
[03:18:45] <Cork> Xatenev: it depends on when you ask actually
[03:18:50] <se_busca_ayuda> I loaded jquery and jqueryui in my index.html before calling another javascript file, but in the another javascript file, it does not recognize the ‘$’ symbol. error message: error    '$' is not defined
[03:18:51] <jop007> you are right
[03:19:12] <jop007> I got this on hhe console cannot call methods on collapsible prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'option'
[03:19:29] <Xatenev> Cork: Well, you atleast are always here
[03:19:29] <Xatenev> xD
[03:19:40] <jop007> This is the code document.ready I have this oelcollapse = $('#insured_sum'); oelcollapse.collapsible('option', 'collapsed', false);
[03:19:42] <Cork> jop007: you're calling options before the initialize call
[03:19:55] <Cork> *option
[03:20:02] <jop007> Yes I noticed but how to avoid this?
[03:20:17] <Cork> call .collapsible({}) first
[03:20:37] <Cork> and you prob want to set collapsed: false in there
[03:20:42] <Cork> instead of using option
[03:21:03] <jop007> okay
[03:21:04] <Cork> se_busca_ayuda: does jQuery work?
[03:21:43] <se_busca_ayuda> Cork: on my index.html yes
[03:21:51] <se_busca_ayuda> but not in my main.js
[03:21:54] <Cork> se_busca_ayuda: where you get the error
[03:22:11] <Cork> ok, so something makes it run before jquery is loaded
[03:22:13] <se_busca_ayuda> firefox inspector console i think its called
[03:22:30] <jop007> I am tyring to find a collapsible code to find out what you mean cork
[03:23:19] <Cork> ah
[03:23:24] <Cork> jop007: this is mobile?
[03:23:48] <jop007> Yes 1.4.5
[03:23:52] <Xatenev> Anybody an idea what is wrong with this string? <div class='col-xs-3' id='topicId-" + id + "-selected>'<p>" + label + " <i class='fa fa-times pull-right' id='topicId" + id + "-remove'></i></p></div>

[03:24:00] <jop007> I had it running with older code
[03:24:03] <Cork> "initialize the ..."
[03:24:07] <Cork> that is the code you want
[03:24:17] <Xatenev> Its rekt up in the source code
[03:24:20] <Xatenev> but im too dumb to see :|
[03:24:35] <Cork> Xatenev: it should be using a template instead
[03:24:40] <d3m0n> Switched to localstorage, thanks Cork
[03:24:43] <Cork> thats what is wrong with it
[03:24:52] <d3m0n> Works now too
[03:24:53] <Xatenev> Cork: hm?
[03:25:07] <Cork> you shouldn't keep that much html in js
[03:25:12] <jop007> So like this $( ".selector" ).collapsible({
[03:25:12] <Xatenev> well
[03:25:13] <jop007> collapsed: false
[03:25:15] <jop007> });
[03:25:24] <Xatenev> Cork: But I have to append such a div
[03:25:27] <Xatenev> for every checkbox which is checked
[03:25:34] <Xatenev> when i click a button
[03:25:36] <Cork> Xatenev: so use a template
[03:26:20] <Xatenev> Cork: I make a html file and then?
[03:26:23] <Xatenev> I am inside an ajax call there
[03:26:25] <d3m0n> It looks like you're missing single quotes too Xatenev
[03:26:31] <Xatenev> d3m0n: yea something like that i guess^^
[03:26:44] <Cork> Xatenev: for templates you normally store it in a script tag
[03:26:44] <Xatenev> d3m0n: but when i change anything its even more dying
[03:26:55] <Cork> Xatenev: and have the template engine replace the values
[03:26:55] <Xatenev> Cork: can u give me a link on that maybe?^^

[03:27:28] <Xatenev> ok
[03:27:28] <Xatenev> :P
[03:27:29] <Xatenev> ty
[03:28:18] <Xatenev> Anyways, is somebody able to fix my string for now?
[03:28:36] <Uhkis> use "" for html and ' for js, it just looks better
[03:28:58] <d3m0n> Actually, what's broken about it? You were just missing a closing quote for the topidID
[03:29:03] <d3m0n> And What Uhkis said too
[03:29:15] <d3m0n> append("<div class='col-xs-3' id='topicId-" + id + "-selected'>'<p>" + label + " <i class='fa fa-times pull-right' id='topicId" + id + "-remove'></i></p></div>")
[03:29:37] <Xatenev> I'll try it out, one second
[03:29:40] <Xatenev> and then ill read up more about those templates
[03:29:40] <Xatenev> :P
[03:29:53] <Xatenev> not doing js that often :\
[03:30:36] <Uhkis> <div class='stuff'> looks so wrong :P
[03:31:12] <Cork> ya, i agree
[03:31:33] <Xatenev> <div class="col-xs-3" id="topicId-8-selected">'<p> <i class="fa fa-times pull-right" id="topicId8-remove"></i></p></div>
[03:31:45] <Xatenev> this is how it looks in the source code
[03:31:46] <d3m0n> Same
[03:32:02] <d3m0n> Yeah switch your quotes around
[03:32:07] <Xatenev> ayay
[03:32:23] <Xatenev> does it make a difference?
[03:32:28] <Cork> no
[03:32:28] <d3m0n> Yes
[03:32:32] <d3m0n> id="topicId-8-selected">'<p>
[03:32:39] <Cork> not in reality
[03:32:43] <Cork> it just makes it easier to read
[03:33:06] <Xatenev> Wrong still
[03:33:07] <Xatenev> xP
[03:33:13] <Xatenev> when i switch them around
[03:33:20] <d3m0n> How can his source change it to double then
[03:33:21] <Cork> Xatenev: and you're quote problems is one of the reasons one shouldn't keep this much html in the js
[03:33:27] <Xatenev> Cork: yea i get that
[03:33:32] <Xatenev> it should work for now though, cause it has to go live
[03:33:36] <Xatenev> and then ill read up on those templates
[03:33:44] <Xatenev> I definetly got ur advice there
[03:34:04] <Cork> Xatenev: do you have a fiddle with the actual js you have problem with?
[03:34:19] <Xatenev> I cna create one fast
[03:34:24] <Xatenev> Its just about concating the string though
[03:34:24] <Xatenev> ^^
[03:34:31] <Xatenev> making one right now
[03:34:46] <Cork> ya, but if you include the command it is easier to explain how it should look
[03:34:57] <Cork> while what you first posted missed the starting quite for example
[03:35:12] <Cork> so having a little context makes sure the "fix" doesn't get missunderstood
[03:35:19] <Cork> *misunderstood
[03:35:32] <d3m0n> append('<div class="col-xs-3" id="topicId-' + id + '-selected"><p>' + label + '<i class="fa fa-times pull-right" id="topicId' + id + '-remove"></i></p></div>') ?
[03:36:36] <Xatenev> I will try d3m0n stuff out fast
[03:36:40] <Xatenev> and if it doesnt work im goin to fiddle
[03:36:41] <Xatenev> :p
[03:36:45] <d3m0n> Yea lol
[03:37:37] <Xatenev> ha
[03:37:38] <Xatenev> this looks good
[03:37:48] <Xatenev> Just the one variable label is empty now, lets see
[03:39:37] <Xatenev> working!:)
[03:39:39] <Xatenev> ty for help
[03:39:44] <Xatenev> *HAPPY*
[03:39:45] <Xatenev> :D
[03:40:59] <d3m0n> Please follow Cork and Uhkis advice though. I just gave you a bandaid.
[03:42:03] <Xatenev> ya like i said, i will read up about it^^
[03:44:15] <Cork> man why do every freaking linux project have cork in it now days -_-'
[03:44:23] <Cork> (in the name)
[03:44:48] <Uhkis> Cork: your reputation preceeds you ;D
[03:45:23] <Cork> corkscrew, module-role-cork, ...
[03:45:31] <Uhkis> Cork: quick pacman -Ss only found corkscrew
[03:45:31] <john-dev> cork they misspelled cock..
[03:46:02] <Cork> <-<
[03:46:28] <Cork> Uhkis: i get highlighted every time they talk about the freaking thing so, i know about it >_>
[03:48:49] <smoke_> im hiding a button when user leaves focus on input elements and showing the same button when they change values in the input field (save button) but sometimes when i click the button the button disappears and failed to trigger the mouseclick  is there something i can do to prevent this from happening?
[03:48:51] <Uhkis> Cork: /hilight -word Cork maybe?
[03:49:12] <Cork> Uhkis: this highlighter doesn't support that sadly
[03:49:21] <Cork> ?g znc highlight
[03:49:21] <b-ot> Cork: watch - ZNC → http://wiki.znc.in/Watch
[03:51:07] <Uhkis> Cork: switch back to irssi ;)
[03:51:22] <Cork> nope
[03:51:29] <Cork> irssi isn't even close to an option
[03:51:38] <Xatenev> irssi is irc client right? .p
[03:51:50] <Xatenev> command line irc client or smth like dat
[03:52:00] <Uhkis> it's the client of the future!!
[03:52:09] <Xatenev> terminal-based? :D
[03:55:55] <Uhkis> yes
[03:56:02] <Uhkis> so: perfect ;)
[03:59:37] <Xatenev> are there alot jobs as pure JS dev?
[04:11:35] <Cork> Xatenev: i wouldn't want it so not sure
[04:19:40] <Turaylon> Hi guys, how i can remove a global scopes in a single call?
[04:20:42] <Turaylon> i have implemented a Scope that implements the ScopeInterface, implemented apply and remove but how and where i should call the remove method?
[04:21:35] <john-dev> g
[04:23:07] <se_busca_ayuda> So I implemented jquery in my index.html file before sourcing my main.js file in index.html, but the operations in main.js that use $ and autocomplete don’t recognize $ as a proper variable name. error    '$' is not defined
[04:23:11] <se_busca_ayuda> anyone know waht’s up with that?
[04:27:04] <john-dev> se_busca_ayuda: use $(document).ready(function()})
[04:27:43] <swiggle> hi guys, just wondered if anyone could help me, i'm a bit of a loss here as to what's going on, i have created a fiddle here https://jsfiddle.net/ahoxbf6a/1/ I don't understand why the name is't john both times
[04:27:55] <john-dev> or try jQuery() instead of $, maybe your autocomplete script adds a $.noConflict..
[04:28:43] <swiggles> just lost that message, browser went weird
[04:29:27] <swiggles> but is var data a reference or something?
[04:29:44] <se_busca_ayuda> john-dev: i’ll try that
[04:32:43] <john-dev> swiggles: looks like yes, .data() is probably just a reference to the data-test-object element and since you change the ref, you change the source
[04:33:24] <john-dev> try to debug your data-test-soruce using firebug or seomthing
[04:33:38] <swiggles> ok, is there anyway of it not being a reference?
[04:34:07] <swiggles> i tried assigning var to another var but it seems to reference through that too
[04:35:26] <john-dev> swiggles: looks like its a shallow copy -> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/c33108cad16ba6ff831d5cbc45b9dfbf12650e0e/src/data.js#L93
[04:35:33] <Xatenev> I can't call .each on a normal JS array or?
[04:35:58] <guzzlefry> Xatenev: for loop for that
[04:36:35] <swiggles> ah ok, thank you, i think i might be getting somewhere now, i'm not great with JS so a bit confusing, looks like it could be related to this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18359093/how-to-copy-javascript-object-to-new-variable-not-by-reference
[04:36:40] <john-dev> Xatenev: you can use each
[04:37:59] <se_busca_ayuda> john-dev: didn’t work… $ and jQuery() are still undefined
[04:38:12] <john-dev> swiggles: i thnk thats the best way to create a real copy.. -> https://jsfiddle.net/ahoxbf6a/2/
[04:38:27] <john-dev> se_busca_ayuda: are you sure jquery is loaded BEFORE you try to use $?
[04:39:22] <john-dev> g
[04:39:25] <se_busca_ayuda> john-dev: let me check the order of things. brb
[04:39:40] <swiggles> john-dev: thank you very much, you've made my day :)
[04:40:12] <john-dev> swiggles: you are welcome :)
[04:40:20] <se_busca_ayuda> john-dev: yes, the jquery fies load before main.js
[04:40:26] <john-dev> se_busca_ayuda: this aticle points it out, us .ready() -> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2194992/jquery-is-not-defined
[04:40:36] <john-dev> use*
[04:42:13] <masscrx> hi
[04:42:49] <masscrx> I have event, a.on("click", function(){ $('.myElement').remove()  })
[04:43:34] <masscrx> how to access .myElement ? I guess that function is changing scope and element is not available
[04:44:02] <john-dev> $('.myElement') is the right way.. or do you mean $(this)?
[04:44:49] <masscrx> I mean $(), but now I have error: Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[04:45:01] <masscrx> that is on line where Im trying remove $()
[04:45:10] <john-dev> you cant remove $()
[04:45:31] <masscrx> $('.myElement') I mean
[04:45:50] <john-dev> can you nopaste your code in a jsfiddle maybe?
[04:46:39] <masscrx> Yeah But I work with a bit complicated system so I can only show you that piece of code
[04:47:55] <masscrx> john-dev: http://jsfiddle.net/akers5ou/
[04:48:26] <masscrx> john-dev: line 9 and 19 are objects which I want to show/hide
[04:48:44] <masscrx> and line 71,72 produce error
[04:49:47] <john-dev> masscrx: what error?
[04:49:59] <masscrx> Uncaught TypeError: undefined is not a function
[04:50:43] <masscrx> so it looks like functions in line  71,72 dont see $() objects
[04:51:07] <masscrx> so propably is another scope
[04:51:08] <john-dev> it wouldnt even matter if the selector wouldn’t exist, this error shouldnt occur
[04:51:24] <john-dev> debug $('.newProjectModalDialogTemplateDescription‘).length
[04:51:46] <masscrx> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected identifier
[04:51:54] <bePolite> Please what is the IRC channel for qunit?
[04:53:30] <[Non]> hi
[04:53:30] <masscrx> I could access that element by .parent or .closest but it will be tricky
[04:53:42] <[Non]> my jquery code looks fine and giving me no error, but functions doesnt work at the moment
[04:53:47] <[Non]> what can i do for that?
[04:53:48] <john-dev> bePolite: they state it’s #jquery-dev
[04:54:36] <john-dev> masscrx: i still can’t comprehend that error message from line 71 nor 72
[04:55:00] <john-dev> even if $('.newProjectModalDialogProjectName') wouldnt exist, jquery would simply do nothing..
[04:55:50] <masscrx> if there is no object for function, then is error, this is normal
[04:55:58] <masscrx> propably with strict mode
[04:56:36] <john-dev> so try to use $('.newProjectModalDialogProjectName‘).length first
[04:56:48] <john-dev> if($('.newProjectModalDialogProjectName‘).length > 0) { $('.newProjectModalDialogProjectName‘).show(); }
[04:57:28] <robscow> i'm building a widget, so have inlined jquery, which is kinda working ok, correct version being loaded, etc. but when i try "some" methods, they fail.  I can call .each() on some classes, and can .addClass()(, but can't .getAttribute or set .css() http://pastebin.com/pigXuwnH
[04:57:51] <Uhkis> masscrx: your error is extra ) on line #48
[04:58:10] <Uhkis> (at least on that fiddle)
[04:58:37] <robscow> there is a different version of jquery loaded on the page, in the head, but when i alert the version of jquery it reports the one i inlined
[04:58:48] <john-dev> robscow: use .attr()
[04:59:05] <robscow> john-dev, and setting css?
[04:59:16] <masscrx> aa shit, propably I know what is going on
[04:59:24] <masscrx> jquery-ui is not loaded :P
[04:59:40] <masscrx> strange, but possible
[05:00:23] <masscrx> yeah
[05:00:30] <masscrx> simple hide() works
[05:00:49] <john-dev> robscow: well, v1.11.2  should support .css() :-/
[05:01:31] <john-dev> masscrx: as i told you, it doesn’t matter if your selector exists or not.. :)
[05:01:39] <robscow> john-dev, oh hang on, i think it is working now  :)
[05:02:44] <masscrx> ok john-dev skill +1 ;]
[05:02:47] <masscrx> thx
[05:02:54] <john-dev> you are welcome :)
[05:03:47] <se_busca_ayuda> john-dev: i tried putting the calling of script main.js and the javascript code in the $.(document).ready() function, and while the javascript code works, main.js still gives me $ is undefined
[05:04:12] <john-dev> se_busca_ayuda: can you nopaste your code?
[05:04:34] <se_busca_ayuda> john-dev: http://hastebin.com/cexanuyisa.xml
[05:04:40] <se_busca_ayuda> thats the index.html file
[05:05:50] <Uhkis> #42 what?
[05:06:20] <john-dev> #42 is non-sense..
[05:06:35] <masscrx> john-dev: but I dont understand one thing, .hide() works, but .hide('slide', {direction: 'left'}, 200) doesnt, when I;m checking $.ui there is correct answer
[05:06:50] <Uhkis> 42-46 should just like every other script include
[05:06:53] <masscrx> so how to access functionality from jqueryui ?
[05:06:56] <john-dev> you can load your main.js right away, the functions inside main.js who call a $-method should be ins ide .ready()
[05:07:49] <se_busca_ayuda> it should be in a $(document).ready(), right? it gives me a $ is undefined at that line if i do that
[05:08:17] <john-dev> se_busca_ayuda: http://jsfiddle.net/gyjdmsn0/ <- its working just fine
[05:09:07] <se_busca_ayuda> john-dev: thats because of the index.html section, i’m trying to phase that out and make it work via main.js instead
[05:11:27] <se_busca_ayuda> i feel like i’m not being clear, here, clearly its my fault for not explaining the situation better
[05:12:47] <Uhkis> se_busca_ayuda: 1) include your main.js normally 2) your main.js should start with $(document).ready(function() { 3) ?? 4) profit
[05:13:52] <Cork> se_busca_ayuda: alternatively you can use $.getScript()
[05:14:02] <se_busca_ayuda> hmmm
[05:14:05] <Cork> but ya, what you have there doesn't load the js
[05:14:11] <se_busca_ayuda> cork in my index.html
[05:14:13] <se_busca_ayuda> ?
[05:14:20] <Cork> yes line 42 does not load the script
[05:14:34] <Cork> sorry 44
[05:14:38] <Uhkis> now lets see if third time's the charm
[05:15:09] <Cork> se_busca_ayuda: your defining html in js, and expects js to know what to do with it
[05:15:17] <Cork> *you're
[05:16:01] <Cork> the cleanest solution is to just replace that section with <script type="text/javascript" src="src/main.js"></script> instead
[05:16:18] <se_busca_ayuda> i had that before, still no bueno :-(
[05:16:31] <Cork> did you add the .ready inside main.js?
[05:16:39] <Cork> actually that shouldn't matter
[05:16:41] <kiwiip> Hey
[05:16:47] <se_busca_ayuda> cork yes, it geave me a $ is not defined at line 2
[05:16:48] <Cork> se_busca_ayuda: do you have a live link?
[05:18:24] <john-dev> masscrx: i think your .show(…) syntax might be wrong
[05:18:36] <se_busca_ayuda> cork: herre’s my main.js file : http://hastebin.com/xekikadovi.coffee
[05:19:18] <Cork> ug... $('#autocom')(jQuery)??
[05:19:39] <se_busca_ayuda> cork: desperation :-S
[05:19:40] <Cork> se_busca_ayuda: that file doesn't parse
[05:20:00] <Cork> you're missing the end tag for ready
[05:20:04] <Cork> and... ugg
[05:20:15] <masscrx> john-dev: my syntax works with v1.11.4 & jQuery v2.1.1, but not with jQuery UI - v1.10.3 & v2.0.3
[05:20:31] <se_busca_ayuda> oh sorry i was copypasting there’s a bunch of comments and after that is the end tag for ready, my bad
[05:20:44] <Cork> se_busca_ayuda: http://jsfiddle.net/5nt1sjj0/
[05:20:46] <Cork> try that
[05:20:56] <Cork> define might mess things up though
[05:21:23] <kiwiip> jquery noob here.
[05:21:23] <Cork> as i'm not sure how that affects execution order
[05:21:41] <kiwiip> What is the best way to do document ready? I see that much variations
[05:21:56] <john-dev> $(document).ready(function() { });
[05:21:58] <Cork> kiwiip: there is only three versions
[05:22:07] <Uhkis> "only three" :D
[05:22:12] <Uhkis> for the same exact thing.. :D
[05:22:23] <Cork> $(function() {}) $(document).ready(function() {}) <-- these two are identical
[05:22:27] <arthurvr> More then three actually :D
[05:22:30] <Cork> and at the end fo the body
[05:22:37] <arthurvr> This thing: http://jsbin.com/rateferivi/3/edit?js,output
[05:22:45] <arthurvr> I love to use it like that
[05:22:52] <Cork> heh
[05:22:59] <Cork> ah, ya never thought of using deferred
[05:23:07] <Cork> not sure why anyone would want to...
[05:23:10] <arthurvr> I should warn that it isn’t a deferred
[05:23:17] <arthurvr> or at least not a real one :/
[05:23:27] <arthurvr> pretty similar but custom
[05:23:43] <Cork> arthurvr: $,when() builds a deferred internally
[05:23:59] <arthurvr> I like to use it this way just as a personal opinion, you should use the way you like.
[05:24:08] <arthurvr> Yeah tho I know jQuery.ready is tricky.
[05:24:39] <Cork> personally i use the one with the least number of characters and call it quits there :)
[05:24:45] <arthurvr> This is kind a slightly different way which can be tricky. http://jsbin.com/rateferivi/3/edit?js,output
[05:24:57] <Cork> $(()={}) ftw! j/k
[05:25:17] <se_busca_ayuda> cork: no bueno :-(
[05:25:17] <Cork> arthurvr: ya, again using deferred
[05:25:35] <Cork> se_busca_ayuda: do you have a live link?
[05:25:50] <se_busca_ayuda> cork: no it’s just running on grunt on my laptop :-(
[05:26:09] <Cork> se_busca_ayuda: ok, then you are kinda forced to track this down you're self
[05:26:19] <Cork> se_busca_ayuda: i suspect define() is the cause of you're problem
[05:26:28] <kiwiip> Yeah arthurvr nice hint
[05:26:33] <kiwiip> thxx
[05:26:38] <kiwiip> also thanks Cork :D
[05:27:03] <kiwiip> I think I'll go for .when as it is structurally the same as the rest of my code is formatted (using promises)
[05:27:34] <Uhkis> and you said you're a jquery noob, lies! :D
[05:27:59] <Cork> :)
[05:28:17] <Cork> ya, noobs normally don't go out starting with promise
[05:28:25] <arthurvr> Why wouldn’t they lol
[05:28:26] <Cork> the world would be a better place if they did :D
[05:28:42] <arthurvr> We’re at least trying to push them too :)
[05:28:46] <Cork> though i'm not sure i think ready is a good place for it
[05:29:17] <Cork> ready is complex enough as it is, not sure i think it need even more machinery around it
[05:29:30] <arthurvr> This makes it less complex imho
[05:29:41] <arthurvr> but you’re probably right that beginners shouldn’t use it
[05:30:55] <arthurvr> We had a huge discussion about it when we were documenting it (the team I mean)
[05:31:45] <sacho_> if you're using ready as the entry point in your code, then the promise isn't very usefu;
[05:32:16] <arthurvr> You shouldn’t specifically use it therefor, but that’s a whole other discussion.
[05:33:12] <Cork> arthurvr: has there been any new discussions about requestAnimationFrame?
[05:33:32] <arthurvr> Depends on when you saw the last discussion about it
[05:33:36] <Cork> it really pains me that jquery still relies on setInterval
[05:33:44] <arthurvr> It’s a hot topic :)
[05:33:47] <Cork> arthurvr: when the patch was backed out
[05:33:53] <Cork> and a little more after
[05:35:07] <Cork> not? haven't seen much about it since the blog post asking for getting this fixed about six months after the backout
[05:35:15] <arthurvr> We’re looking into velocity.js as a replacement for fn.animate and co
[05:35:15] <Cork> *hot?*
[05:35:26] <arthurvr> We discuss it much I mean lol
[05:35:42] <Cork> cool
[05:35:50] <arthurvr> fyi https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2053
[05:36:02] <Cork> really cool :D
[05:36:17] <arthurvr> there was another discussion about it as well lemme search
[05:37:41] <arthurvr> Oh you didn’t know it was reintroduced?
[05:37:54] <arthurvr> I though you was referring to a newer discussion
[05:37:57] <arthurvr> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/72119e0023dcc0d9807caf6d988598b74abdc937
[05:38:30] <arthurvr> Cork: awesomesauce isn’t it
[05:38:38] <Cork> wow... that's gone be right by
[05:38:47] <Cork> lost and lost of good news here!
[05:38:53] <arthurvr> Sure!
[05:40:20] <arthurvr> Cork: v3 will have lots of awesomeness :D
[05:40:31] <Cork> ya
[05:42:08] <Cork> arthurvr: do you have a timeframe for when we might see v4?
[05:42:48] <arthurvr> Timeframe? I probably don’t… We’re hoping to have the v3 beta quick
[05:43:55] <se_busca_ayuda> let me try another method… is there a way to include jquery.js into main.js by calling it somehow?
[05:44:16] <Cork> se_busca_ayuda: no, you include it in the page
[05:44:26] <Cork> se_busca_ayuda: js isn't scoped by resource
[05:44:53] <Cork> so if something is defined globally in one resource all resources after it in the page have access to it
[05:45:03] <se_busca_ayuda> drat
[05:47:39] <Fractional> Hi, I'm having a problem with jQuery. Why am I iterating over ONE elements attributes rather than over multiple elements with the .calculate class? https://gist.github.com/Freddan962/61cdc26d999fb4d3f093
[05:48:27] <Cork> Fractional: use .each
[05:48:32] <arthurvr> Fractional: That’s not the way to loop over jQuery collections
[05:48:37] <Cork> for in isn't safe for use there
[05:48:46] <arthurvr> `api each @ Fractional
[05:48:46] <b-ot> Fractional: .each(): Iterate over a jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.  http://api.jquery.com/each/
[05:50:00] <Uhkis> also, umlauts in attributes can't be good
[05:51:40] <Cork> Uhkis: what attribute are you talking about?
[05:52:10] <Fractional> Cork, arthurvr, b-ot : Thanks, now my code looks like this: https://gist.github.com/Freddan962/743df6ef3d768a8cc3bb and I am getting a message that the val function is undefined
[05:52:14] <Uhkis> https://gist.github.com/Freddan962/61cdc26d999fb4d3f093#file-gistfile1-html-L23
[05:52:16] <Fractional> It iterates over each text input
[05:52:16] <Uhkis> that one
[05:52:24] <Cork> Fractional: btw for the record, you're not looping the attributes of the element, your looking the found element indexes and all the jquery functions
[05:52:43] <Cork> Fractional: use $(this).val()
[05:52:56] <Cork> you can remove the arguments to the function
[05:53:12] <Cork> ah the id
[05:53:20] <Cork> Uhkis: is that what you meant?
[05:53:37] <Fractional> Cork, thanks. But - the error still persists. The val function is undefined
[05:53:40] <Cork> Uhkis: ids can contain all kind of crazy characters
[05:53:48] <Cork> Fractional: did you use $()?
[05:53:54] <Cork> cause that should work
[05:54:22] <Cork> $('.calculate').each(function() { console.log($(this).val()); });
[05:54:27] <Fractional> Cork, thank you very much, fixed it :- )
[05:55:11] <Cork> Fractional: well everything for a countryman ;)
[05:55:20] <Cork> j/k
[05:55:42] <Uhkis> Cork: yeah, but i don't trust anything but ascii in them!
[05:55:53] <Cork> Uhkis: it is ascii
[05:55:57] <Cork> just not us ascii
[05:55:59] <Uhkis> or english for that matter
[05:56:12] <Cork> i guess you haven't seen my crash id example >_>
[05:56:34] <Uhkis> show? :)
[05:56:35] <Fractional> Cork, one last question if you don't mind. When I for instance enter: 2323212 in one of the input forms, I see: 02323212. This is the code: https://gist.github.com/Freddan962/3ec907bddffd43a68924
[05:58:20] <Cork> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/w3qRm/2/
[05:58:30] <Fractional> Cork, ignore my cry for help. Use of strings, gotta convert. Meh.
[05:59:09] <Cork> Fractional: input values area always string
[05:59:25] <Cork> you have to parse it to a number if you want to do math
[05:59:49] <Fractional> Cork, yeah. I've been into Ruby for too long. I assumed JavaScript automatically parsed the strings (probably due to sleep, I knew it doesn't happen)
[05:59:49] <Cork> use parseInt(str, 10) or parseFloat(str) depending on what you need
[06:00:10] <Cork> Fractional: well it kinda does
[06:00:16] <Cork> depending on how you do it :)
[06:00:20] <Uhkis> Cork: that is just wrong :D
[06:00:32] <Cork> js> print(+"10 + 1)
[06:00:34] <Cork> opps
[06:00:35] <b-ot> Cork: No output.
[06:00:37] <Cork> js> print(+"10" + 1)
[06:00:40] <b-ot> Cork: 11
[06:00:49] <Cork> Uhkis: isn't it lovely?
[06:01:25] <Uhkis> Cork: abomination! :D
[06:01:35] <Cork> Uhkis: well it was intended to be
[06:01:55] <decx> what do you mean + is awesome?
[06:02:03] <decx> as is | 0
[06:02:55] <decx> i dont like ~~ though ^^
[06:07:32] <Fractional> containerValue = NaN; if (containerValue != NaN) {console.log("executed");} - Why is executed being logged?
[06:07:52] <Cork> ah, good old one
[06:07:57] <Omar-> Cork print(+"10" + 1) is string not a number, right?
[06:08:03] <Cork> js> print(NaN == NaN)
[06:08:07] <b-ot> Cork: false
[06:08:15] <Cork> Fractional: use isNaN
[06:08:16] <anli> How do I get rid of the image load icon/broken image icon?
[06:08:25] <Fractional> Cork, roger that.
[06:08:30] <Cork> Omar-: no it is a number
[06:08:38] <Cork> Omar-: +"10" === 10
[06:08:56] <Omar-> without + it becomes a string, true?
[06:09:01] <Cork> yes
[06:09:08] <Omar-> neat!
[06:10:45] <decx> Omar- also ~~"10" === 10 and  ("10" | 0) === 10
[06:12:28] <Cork> well so is Number("10") :)
[06:12:32] <Cork> when we're at it
[06:12:42] <Omar-> yea I know Number()
[06:12:50] <decx> booring booring
[06:12:51] <Omar-> decx I know || but |?
[06:12:57] <Omar-> new to me :D
[06:13:03] <Omar-> also ~~
[06:13:15] <Omar-> && || > < == !
[06:13:41] <decx> beware as (5.5 | 0) === 5
[06:14:08] <Cork> Omar-: || is logical or, and | is bitwise
[06:14:12] <decx> https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators
[06:14:15] <Cork> same for & and &&
[06:14:19] <Cork> and so on
[06:15:00] <Omar-> decx deutsch!
[06:15:18] <decx> fucking google
[06:15:23] <Cork> also be aware of the 32bit limit for | and &
[06:15:30] <Cork> + doesn't have that problem
[06:15:38] <decx> localized search results have to be the worst
[06:15:55] <Cork> ?mdn bitwise operators
[06:15:56] <b-ot> Cork: Bitwise operators - JavaScript | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators
[06:16:00] <decx> "how about we take the inter from the net and replace it with regional
[06:16:05] <Cork> decx: i often get pl :/
[06:16:12] <Cork> and i don't even understand it >_<
[06:16:19] <decx> ha
[06:16:37] <Omar-> i'll have to read first about Bitwise
[06:16:39] <decx> good reminder to set duckduckgo as default again
[06:16:44] <Omar-> sounds complicated
[06:17:09] <Cork> Omar-: it is the basics of how binary operations work
[06:17:15] <Cork> that is what drives the computer :)
[06:17:34] <decx> it's still complicated
[06:17:46] <decx> and fast
[06:17:53] <Cork> well not really
[06:18:01] <Cork> it is basically different form of masks
[06:18:44] <decx> if you know what happens it appears easy, but if you have no insight in that topic it's quite daunting
[06:18:50] <Cork> though might not be obvious if you've never used a lowlevel language >_>
[06:18:54] <decx> right
[06:19:18] <Cork> what messes with me is & -1 and | -1 in js
[06:19:31] <Cork> it totally breaks all bitwise logic
[06:19:53] <decx> isnt everything -1 then?
[06:19:57] <decx> or something
[06:20:07] <Cork> no you get a negative result
[06:20:23] <Cork> not a max bit
[06:21:23] <Omar-> Cork but are those operators often used in web development? would I use them in my jQ code?
[06:21:35] <Cork> Omar-: not really
[06:21:40] <decx> they are used in hyperoptimized apps like asm
[06:21:51] <decx> well not apps in asms case
[06:21:53] <Cork> well and games
[06:22:04] <Cork> basically if you need to calculate rays and things like that
[06:22:06] <Cork> you need it
[06:22:23] <Cork> you don't normally need it to move elements around :)
[06:22:33] <decx> doesnt hurt if you have a bunch of floating elements on canvas
[06:23:16] <Cork> log is much more interesting most of the time :)
[06:23:36] <Cork> and by log i mean Math.log not console.log :D
[06:26:32] <Omar-> hmmm..too complicated
[06:26:34] <Omar-> haha
[06:26:54] <Omar-> I dont know how to use canvas. I have no intention to learn it.
[06:27:02] <Cork> Omar-: if you look at number as bits it becomes easy
[06:27:28] <Cork> 1010 & 0100 == 1110
[06:27:37] <Cork> opps sorry wrong
[06:27:39] <Cork> 1010 | 0100 == 1110
[06:27:41] <Omar-> haha
[06:27:55] <Cork> 1010 & 1000 == 1000
[06:28:20] <Cork> 1010 ^ 1000 == 10
[06:28:29] <Cork> 1010 ^ 1100 == 110
[06:29:51] <Cork> man i miss my old dos programming days
[06:30:08] <Cork> no help frameworks you did it all :D
[06:48:53] <MAxou88>  Hey do you think I can this jquery plugin http://tablesorter.com/docs/index.html on a table generated row row with php foreach ?
[06:49:33] <decx> you generate the table on the server and use the script on the client why wouldnt it work?
[06:52:01] <MAxou88> yes let's try :)
[07:03:24] <MAxou88> Hey, I try to use this jquery plugin Table sorter http://tablesorter.com/docs/index.html i dont undezrstand where i need to add the part on the doc where they say : "Start by telling tablesorter to sort your table when the document is loaded:" where i need to add this code ?
[07:03:44] <Fractional> I'm trying to change the value of a text input form by writing: $('#form').val(50); - what am I doing wrong? The visible text doesn't update nor does the value later on in my calculations
[07:05:16] <Cork> Fractional: the id makes it look like you're targeting the wrong element
[07:05:31] <Cork> so; are you sure you target the input field and not the form?
[07:06:17] <Fractional> Cork, yes the input field. (ignore my id naming)
[07:06:31] <Cork> Fractional: should work just fine then
[07:06:47] <Cork> Fractional: make sure no other element has the same id
[07:06:56] <Cork> as that might be the problem
[07:07:00] <Fractional> Cork, if you have the time: https://join.me/433-189-972
[07:07:30] <Cork> heh, noo
[07:07:38] <Cork> if you want help from me it is on irc
[07:07:43] <decx> MAxou88: read this http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/document-ready/
[07:07:59] <MAxou88> thx for your help
[07:08:10] <Cork> man gnome 3.16 is slick...
[07:08:19] <decx> if you're just starting out learn.jquery.com has loads of useful tips
[07:10:26] <Uhkis> Cork: anything fun new stuff in it?
[07:10:50] <Cork> Uhkis: rip notification tray for a starter
[07:11:08] <Cork> the calculator has got a new history section (nice)
[07:11:26] <Uhkis> ehm what, where do they go then
[07:11:27] <Cork> and other nibs and bobs
[07:11:40] <Cork> center top
[07:11:41] <Fractional> Cork, https://gist.github.com/Freddan962/144e69232942223b283a looks like: http://i.imgur.com/xzaoAVo.png altough the blue square should say 0 kwh/år since no checkboxes are checked.
[07:11:44] <MAxou88> so i just nned to put this code inside script tag ?
[07:12:00] <Cork> Uhkis: and if you open the calender (the clock) it show old notifications there
[07:12:53] <Uhkis> and of course every extension breaks again
[07:13:19] <Cork> Uhkis: actually not more then the version number change
[07:13:30] <Cork> and the ones touching the topbar
[07:13:38] <Cork> so ya, about 50% of mine :/
[07:13:41] <Uhkis> so, most of mine
[07:13:44] <Uhkis> :D
[07:14:04] <Cork> panel osd isn't needed anymore though so *yay*
[07:14:19] <Cork> Fractional: where are you setting the value
[07:14:22] <Cork> i don't see it
[07:14:38] <Fractional> Cork, #29 in resetValue
[07:14:46] <Fractional> Cork, called from #21
[07:15:05] <Cork> line 29 is an empty line
[07:15:27] <Fractional> Cork, line 27
[07:15:39] <Uhkis> Cork: did it get faster? seems like it's way faster on every update
[07:15:52] <Cork> Uhkis: ya, definitely
[07:15:58] <Cork> though 3.14 wasn't slow
[07:16:20] <Cork> Fractional: wow.. you do love functions don't you?
[07:16:51] <negusnegesti> Hi guys!
[07:16:51] <negusnegesti> Can you please help me to apply deferred here: http://pastie.org/10057387
[07:16:51] <negusnegesti> Would like to have an alert with "DONE" after the function "checkprotel" is done.
[07:16:51] <negusnegesti> Thank you :)
[07:17:01] <Fractional> Cork, surely I do :)
[07:17:07] <Cork> Fractional: sorry it is too much jumping around to read that code
[07:17:17] <Cork> you would have to make a live example so one can step through it
[07:18:57] <Fractional> Cork, https://jsfiddle.net/z1m0tfjg/
[07:21:16] <Cork> Fractional: parseInt($(this).val()) <-- this is not safe to do
[07:21:28] <Cork> you must always use a base for parseInt
[07:21:28] <ezek2k4> how i can tell autocomplete to use something else than value from the souce list
[07:21:46] <Cork> or you might get the number parsed as an octed if your unlucky
[07:21:48] <Fractional> Cork, ok. Will add that
[07:21:54] <Cork> *octet
[07:22:14] <Cork> wow this code is hard to follow >_<
[07:22:39] <ezek2k4> source: data_list; its looking for "value" instead of "country_name"
[07:22:43] <mooncup> 15:21 < Cork> Fractional: parseInt($(this).val()) <-- this is not safe to do
[07:22:47] <mooncup> Cork: explain plz!
[07:22:54] <Cork> i just did
[07:22:58] <Cork> read three lines up
[07:23:02] <mooncup> oh
[07:23:05] <mooncup> nice one
[07:23:35] <mooncup> javascript is silly
[07:23:39] <Cork> parseInt("10") == 9
[07:23:42] <mooncup> is Number() safe to use?
[07:23:42] <Cork> yay...
[07:23:48] <Cork> ya
[07:23:56] <ezek2k4> value or label i velive it looks for
[07:23:59] <Cork> parseInt("10", 10) is too
[07:24:31] <samssh> >> parseInt("10");
[07:24:41] <Cork> samssh: it isn't in all engines
[07:24:42] <samssh> Aww, is that in ##javascript
[07:24:46] <Cork> and that makes it even worse
[07:25:00] <Cork> js> print(parseInt("10"))
[07:25:04] <b-ot> Cork: 10
[07:26:00] <Fractional> Cork, got any idea what I am doing wrong?
[07:26:15] <Cork> to hard to read
[07:26:24] <Cork> i can't plow down enough time in it
[07:27:06] <Fractional> Cork, what can I do to make it more readable then?
[07:27:12] <Cork> Fractional: you want to try to keep where variable gets its value from close to where you use it
[07:27:23] <Cork> so you don't have to read every function in the file to find where it comes from
[07:27:32] <Cork> and how it mutates cross the functions
[07:27:32] <samssh> Cork, What browser gives 9? I just tried FF, Chrome, IE11 and 9, and they all gave 10 for "10".
[07:28:39] <Cork> samssh: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/parseInt#Description
[07:28:43] <Cork> second bullet point
[07:28:51] <samssh> Now, FF will give you 16 for "0x10".
[07:29:01] <Cork> js> print(parseInt("010"))
[07:29:03] <b-ot> Cork: 10
[07:29:19] <Cork> and ya, most browsers should do it correctly now days
[07:29:32] <Cork> but it is still something one should do
[07:29:51] <mbrzuzy> Interesting, Cork. Thanks for pointing that out
[07:30:08] <Cork> samssh: i know to be wary of this cause it has bit me in the past
[07:30:17] <Cork> it was a long time ago though
[07:30:25] <Cork> but was still seriously hard to figure out
[07:30:29] <frank_o> Howdy! How do I find an article from one div whose ID does not match those of the other div? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/sb9b134r/ -- ie. I'm trying to find `#article_4`
[07:30:51] <samssh> Cork, I wonder if we've reached the point where we don't need to worry anymore.
[07:31:27] <Cork> samssh: they have implemented a new function in es6 to be used instead of parseInt :)
[07:31:34] <Cork> i think that answers the question :D
[07:32:01] <decx> if you know you want to find #article_4 why not juts select it from the start frank_o?
[07:32:22] <frank_o> decx: oh, no that's just a hypothetical number
[07:32:26] <decx> also double use of ids
[07:32:31] <samssh> Cork, IE8 is the culprit. parseInt("0100") === 64
[07:32:34] <Cork> samssh: but ya, validators will complain and everything, so just write the three extra characters
[07:32:42] * Cork nods
[07:32:55] <frank_o> decx: basically trying to pull in new articles via ajax if content has changed. just missing this last piece here...
[07:32:58] <Cork> so almost out of there danger zone
[07:33:45] <Cork> es6 has defined ox for octals if i remember correctly
[07:34:52] <decx> frank_o no idea how that applies to your fiddle
[07:35:46] <Cork> frank_o: your html is invalid
[07:36:00] <frank_o> decx: .articles1 is the page currently loaded by the client, .articles2 is the updated page on the server (sorry for the confusing naming scheme) -- i need to figure out which articles in .article2 that aren't in .article1
[07:36:00] <Cork> ids has to be unique you should use a different source
[07:36:13] <frank_o> Cork: true my bad - bad fiddle altogether
[07:36:47] <decx> my guess is you want to use $.extend
[07:36:58] <Cork> decx: for elements?!?
[07:37:06] <decx> i havent thought about it too much
[07:37:09] <Cork> frank_o: you would have to collect the ids from one
[07:37:16] <Cork> and then exclude them from the second
[07:37:22] <frank_o> hmm
[07:37:31] <decx> now i'm curious if extend could do it though ;)
[07:37:52] <Cork> $.map($(old).find('.article'), function(elm) { return this.id; })
[07:37:59] <Cork> decx: it can't
[07:38:11] <decx> *lalala can't hear you lalala*
[07:38:32] <Cork> adn then $(new).find('.article').not('#' + list.join(', #'))
[07:38:41] <Cork> and you have the new elements
[07:39:10] <frank_o> holy moly!!
[07:39:30] <frank_o> awesome man.. one sec
[07:39:52] <Cork> opps error in the first line
[07:40:04] <Cork> $.map($(old).find('.article'), function(elm) { return elm.id; })
[07:40:16] <decx> man, extend was a ridiculous idea ;)
[07:42:19] <frank_o> aaaaaah thats hot
[07:42:21] <frank_o> so so hot
[07:43:40] <frank_o> trippin' off smoke detectors
[07:43:54] <frank_o> check it out guys: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/sb9b134r/1/
[07:44:06] <frank_o> thank you all so much..
[07:50:05] <ezek2k4> i'm still not able to make this works  :( https://jsfiddle.net/725c20um/
[07:50:29] <ezek2k4> tried lot of diff things and advise but at the end for one or another reason it didnt works
[07:51:00] <ezek2k4> and i belive the problem is that autocomplete source is looking for label or value
[07:51:09] <ezek2k4> but i have city_name
[07:51:10] <Cork> ezek2k4: your server is sending objects instead of arrays
[07:52:07] <Cork> it should be [["city1", "city1"],["city2", "city2"]]
[07:52:16] <decx> isnt it the other way around too in jqui autocomplete?
[07:52:22] <decx> ajax inside success
[07:52:29] <decx> eh source
[07:52:30] <decx> not success
[07:52:33] <Cork> heh true
[07:52:35] <Cork> that too
[07:52:45] <ezek2k4> ah
[07:53:01] <Cork> ezek2k4: http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#option-source
[07:53:28] <Cork> so waht i said was wrong
[07:53:38] <Cork> it should be ["city1", "city2", "city2"]
[07:53:59] <Cork> or an array of objects with the keys label and value
[07:54:01] <ezek2k4> http://www.jqueryautocomplete.com/jquery-autocomplete-json-example.html if you see there he has something like me
[07:54:08] <simeon> Hello!
[07:54:25] <Cork> ezek2k4: he has the correct keys
[07:54:30] <Cork> ezek2k4: check the doc page i linked
[07:54:38] <ezek2k4> ok
[07:54:44] <simeon> Is there anybody here? I need some help.
[07:55:05] <Cork> simeon: nope, just ghosts
[07:55:44] <simeon> Ok, guys... ghosts! :)
[07:56:10] <Cork> a silly question requires a silly answer :)
[07:56:31] <simeon> I'm a newbie to jQuery, and just now I'm trying to get some iframe contents()
[07:56:49] <decx> is the iframe on the same domain?
[07:57:17] <Cork> i could bet on the answer
[07:57:48] <simeon> It should be?
[07:58:02] <Cork> it must be, or the browser will block you
[07:58:07] <simeon> Ok.
[07:58:08] <decx> if it isnt you have now entered - the twilight zone
[07:58:48] <Cork> simeon: if they didn't it would mean random sites could have a hidden iframe, load facebook and scrap any data from there
[07:58:55] <Cork> logged in as you :)
[07:59:02] <Cork> bad idea, right? :D
[07:59:21] <simeon> Ok. Let them be on the same domain.
[07:59:24] <Cork> including stealing your facebook account :)
[07:59:33] <decx> so where are the negatives?
[07:59:43] <simeon> I want create iframe dynamically and then change its background color, for example.
[08:00:02] <Cork> hmm is about:blank the same origin...
[08:00:10] <Cork> i use iframes too little :/
[08:00:13] <decx> do you try to find body?
[08:00:21] <simeon> Yes, i do.
[08:00:23] <decx> because contents() is a flat structure
[08:00:27] <decx> you'll have to filter
[08:00:54] <Cork> simeon: document, window and body is special, in that they don't really exist in the document
[08:00:57] <simeon> https://api.jquery.com/contents/
[08:01:01] <simeon> Sorry
[08:01:03] <Cork> after it has been parsed
[08:01:24] <Cork> body is the container that has all the elements in the oage
[08:01:26] <Cork> *page
[08:02:00] <thebatu1> hello all. I have a question concerning Ajax, please see my coffee script file at https://gist.github.com/thebatu/efec510d1aad056b13bf
[08:02:06] <Cork> when you run .contents() it gives you a list of the elements directly inside body
[08:02:17] <thebatu1> how can I display the contents of my ajax response ?
[08:02:23] <simeon>    $("#MyIframe").contents().find("body").css("background-color", "#bada55");
[08:02:36] <Cork> thebatu1: console.log(data)
[08:03:30] <simeon> But it does not work :(
[08:03:39] <Cork> simeon: $("#MyIframe").contents().filter("body").css("background-color", "#bada55");
[08:04:03] <thebatu1> @Cork https://gist.github.com/thebatu/efec510d1aad056b13bf
[08:04:18] <ezek2k4> ah so the deal was to just return them as an array instead of triying to find a way for it to looks for a different key name
[08:04:36] <ezek2k4> but there should be an easy option to tell autocomplete what key to look for
[08:04:38] <silverdust> thebatu1: Why are you still using the old ajax success and error?
[08:04:47] <Cork> ezek2k4: there is a way to do it
[08:04:53] <silverdust> I find the new binded .done().fail() more cool
[08:05:00] <thebatu1> its the only one I know :)
[08:05:01] <Cork> but it is normally easier to just return the correct format
[08:05:05] <silverdust> I use it with coffescript
[08:05:13] <thebatu1> ohh I will try it thanks
[08:05:36] <Cork> why anyone want to use coffeescript is beyond me
[08:05:45] <ezek2k4> i c. Tyvm :)
[08:05:51] <silverdust> Have you tried JSON.parse() thebatu1
[08:06:14] <silverdust> It should convert that string to a JSON object
[08:06:30] <ezek2k4> what you guys use to write code, i have dreamweaver but im sure there is someting much better
[08:06:59] <ezek2k4> and dont say notepad :P
[08:07:00] <simeon> @Cork: it seems, the same effect with "filter" :(
[08:07:07] <decx> use whatever you are most comfortable and productive with
[08:07:17] <thebatu1> yes I did.it gives me Error: Parse error on line 16: Unexpected '.'
[08:07:28] <decx> the question of editors of choice leads to pointless discussion
[08:07:42] <thebatu1> but if I have dataType: 'json' do I still need to parce it ?
[08:08:13] <ezek2k4> well i never used something else thats why i wanted to try, maybe ill find something better, and sugestions how people actually using someting is better sometimes than just google around :)
[08:08:26] <ezek2k4> of*
[08:08:49] <silverdust> wait a min. What do you want exactly now. I saw console.log added to your gist
[08:08:59] <silverdust> You have an object being returned as you wanted
[08:09:03] <samssh> ezek2k4, Atom.io is pretty good. As are Sublime Text, Brackets, and Notepad++. For more IDE functionality Netbeans is decent. Eclipse is also, but it's slower under Windows.
[08:09:34] <ezek2k4> ok il try them :) tyvm
[08:09:41] <decx> yeah i wrote the same ones too and vim
[08:10:10] <simeon> It seem's there is no difference between   $("MyIframe").contents().find("body").css("background-color", "#bada55"); and    $("._html").contents().filter("body").css("background-color", "#bada55");
[08:10:18] <simeon> *seems
[08:10:39] <mooncup> netbeans!
[08:12:20] <samssh> ezek2k4, I haven't used it, but the people willing to pay for and use non-free/OS software seem to like Webstorm.
[08:13:06] <EdwardIII> hey i'm registering a custom ajaxTransport but it doesn't seem to be firing on ajax calls? https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[08:13:23] <thebatu1> @silverdust I am getting the error  Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token o with out=JSON.parce(res)
[08:13:28] <ezek2k4> ok tyvm
[08:13:41] <ezek2k4> 30 days free so ill try :)
[08:13:59] <decx> simeon apparently find DOES work http://jsfiddle.net/acmwLxgo/ i was sure i had to use filter for that stuff
[08:19:55] <simeon> That's strange. In jsfiddle everything seems to be working. Hmm..
[08:20:29] <EdwardIII> like is there something in jquery that lets you prioritise ajaxTransport?
[08:21:13] <EdwardIII> this one never even gets executed
[08:35:26] <thebatu1> I am getting this error """" Error: Parse error on line 17: Unexpected '.' """ when doing $.each res, (index, element) -> alert(index) anyone knows the reason ?
[08:37:15] <robertmaxrees> thebatu1 we'd have to see a functioning fiddle.
[08:38:50] <thebatu1> @robertmaxrees its a rails application so I am not sure how can you see it live, but I have posted the code at https://gist.github.com/thebatu/efec510d1aad056b13bf
[08:39:10] <robertmaxrees> oh, coffeescript.
[08:39:48] <thebatu1> yea but the room of coffeescript is dead lol
[08:40:22] <robertmaxrees> i /think/ i know what you're trying to do here, and my guess is that the $.each() isn't broken - your data is probably bad.
[08:40:27] <robertmaxrees> can you share the response?
[08:41:43] <robertmaxrees> because i'll bet it's not properly formed.
[08:41:56] <thebatu1> ohh!
[08:42:17] <robertmaxrees> :) figure it out?
[08:43:00] <thebatu1> no I am checking if tabs are mixed with spaces but seems all good
[08:43:37] <robertmaxrees> be aware that JS doesn't care about tabs vs spaces.
[08:43:50] <robertmaxrees> just because you've written coffeescript doesn't mean the browser understands it ;)
[08:43:55] <thebatu1> yes u r right I missed 2 spaces
[08:43:58] <thebatu1> :s
[08:44:13] <thebatu1> lol
[08:45:42] <thebatu1> @robertmaxrees anyways, its not working, the chrome console is shouting ""index is not defined""
[08:46:00] <robertmaxrees> ... i can't read coffeescript so i have no idea how to help.
[08:46:36] <robertmaxrees> the correct JS use would be $.each(res, function(index, element) {});
[08:48:29] <thebatu1> yea but this jQuery in a coffee file.
[08:48:42] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[08:48:47] <robertmaxrees> dunno how to help you.
[08:49:14] <robertmaxrees> if you're gonna use CFScript, I assume you know JS well enough to translate.
[08:50:12] <thebatu1> naa i dont, i am doing an internship
[08:50:17] <thebatu1> :)
[08:50:27] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[08:50:35] <robertmaxrees> good luck then ;)
[08:52:33] <thebatu1> :p
[08:54:13] <WorkBox> anyone know how to change the width of an input filed within a div? in my CSS when I change the width in PX, nothing happens.
[08:54:36] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a specificity issue maybe?  bad selector?
[08:54:46] <WorkBox> maybe
[08:54:53] <robertmaxrees> can you fiddle it?
[08:54:59] <Omar-> share your css pls
[08:55:02] <WorkBox> yeah
[08:55:03] <WorkBox> let me fiddle it
[08:55:04] <WorkBox> 1 min
[08:55:20] <Omar-> 5 secs passed, 55 secs remaining
[08:55:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[08:55:35] <Omar-> lol
[08:57:07] <WorkBox> how do you ujse the external resouces
[08:57:09] <WorkBox> for my css??
[08:57:15] <Omar-> jsfiddle?
[08:57:17] <WorkBox> yeah
[08:57:27] <Omar-> use 3 tab on the left "External resources"
[08:57:32] <WorkBox> yeah
[08:57:37] <WorkBox> how to get it to link
[08:57:48] <decx> press the plus?
[08:57:54] <WorkBox> alright
[08:57:57] <WorkBox> maybe its in there
[08:58:02] <WorkBox> i HAVE STYLES.CSS
[08:58:05] <WorkBox> in there right now
[08:58:13] <Omar-> or in CSS editbox type the following: </style> <link to your css> <style>
[08:58:23] <WorkBox> alright, ill just do in line
[08:58:24] <robertmaxrees> no - you'd do that in the html pane.
[08:58:31] <Omar-> click "Save" top toolbar
[08:58:43] <decx> external resources works just fine :p
[08:58:57] <Omar-> or just copy/paste your css in CSS section
[08:59:11] <robertmaxrees> this got really overly complicated.
[08:59:17] <Omar-> seems so
[08:59:23] <Omar-> i thought it was 5 lines
[08:59:23] <robertmaxrees> slow down then ;)
[08:59:34] <Omar-> looks like we have 5000 lines to debug
[08:59:36] <robertmaxrees> WorkBox you're not sharing your entire page into a fiddle right?
[08:59:48] <WorkBox> Im doing the html
[08:59:49] <WorkBox> and css
[08:59:52] <WorkBox> into fiddle
[08:59:55] <WorkBox> its not a lot of code
[09:00:03] <robertmaxrees> but you're not doing all of it?  you're just sharing the broken part, right?
[09:00:09] <WorkBox> ah
[09:00:11] <WorkBox> good note
[09:00:19] <robertmaxrees> ;) we just need a test case.
[09:00:43] <robertmaxrees> a good chunk of time, working to get that test case shows you what's broken.
[09:01:00] <WorkBox> kk
[09:01:02] <WorkBox> how I share it
[09:01:02] <WorkBox> ?
[09:01:05] <WorkBox> https://jsfiddle.net/zuLy5v70/
[09:01:06] <WorkBox> ??
[09:01:17] <robertmaxrees> ...
[09:01:21] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a test case lol
[09:01:29] <WorkBox> sure it is
[09:01:33] <WorkBox> all I need to do
[09:01:36] <WorkBox> it change the width
[09:01:42] <WorkBox> of the input "full name'"
[09:02:24] <Omar-> the input is hidden somewhere
[09:03:16] <WorkBox> could I give an ID to the input
[09:03:19] <WorkBox> and try it thatg way
[09:03:20] <WorkBox> ?
[09:03:32] <robertmaxrees> #fullName input will select it...
[09:03:52] <Omar-> https://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/zuLy5v70/1/
[09:03:53] <WorkBox> ah
[09:03:56] <Omar-> like this?
[09:04:18] <WorkBox> yep
[09:04:31] <Omar-> solved?
[09:04:32] <WorkBox> I just needed to do
[09:04:36] <WorkBox> solved
[09:04:39] <WorkBox> thanks guys!
[09:04:42] <Omar-> $10
[09:04:46] <WorkBox> hah
[09:04:48] <Omar-> ;)
[09:04:48] <WorkBox> $100
[09:04:58] <Omar-> thanks, more than enough
[09:05:00] <Omar-> :D
[09:05:01] <WorkBox> one more question
[09:05:04] <WorkBox> actually
[09:05:20] <WorkBox> I want to make these boxes have 3d rotations when you hover over them
[09:05:26] <WorkBox> what function is used for that
[09:05:34] <Omar-> use CSS transition
[09:05:41] <Omar-> combined with :hover
[09:05:49] <robertmaxrees> fwiw, there's an entire #css channel, WorkBox
[09:05:52] <WorkBox> sweer
[09:06:03] <WorkBox> alright
[09:06:16] <WorkBox> I can use google
[09:06:18] <WorkBox> to figure it out
[09:06:29] <WorkBox> thnks guyd
[09:06:31] <WorkBox> guys
[09:06:48] <Omar-> https://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/zuLy5v70/3/

[09:07:15] <WorkBox> I want it to flip over its selt
[09:07:17] <WorkBox> self
[09:07:19] <WorkBox> not 360
[09:07:24] <WorkBox> but thanks for the demo
[09:07:45] <WorkBox> more like rotate over itself, which I had an example
[09:08:34] <WorkBox> wish*
[09:11:30] <Omar-> WorkBox you mean animation origin?
[09:11:43] <WorkBox> yeah
[09:11:48] <Omar-> hold on
[09:12:26] <WorkBox> I just do -webkit-transform: *whatever here*
[09:12:27] <WorkBox> right
[09:12:27] <WorkBox> ?
[09:14:49] <Omar-> yea
[09:14:56] <WorkBox> kk
[09:20:00] <cuppy> Hi, all. The selector $('#mydiv :eq(n)') selects from a list of all child divs, *and their children*. Is there a selector I can use that allows me to specify the number (like :eq(n) does) from only the top-level children? Also, I think it's possible that I'm not understanding the mechanics, and that something else may be going wrong.
[09:20:37] <robertmaxrees> cuppy $('#mydiv').children().eq(n)
[09:21:12] <cuppy> robertmaxrees, thanks. I knew it was something simple. Much appreciated.
[09:22:12] <momomo> From this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25812505/jquery-globaleval-being-called-on-script-insert
[09:22:27] <momomo> How can I add a use strict to jquery ?
[09:22:30] <momomo> script
[09:22:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:22:48] <samssh> robertmaxrees, Is that faster than $("#mydiv > :eq(n)") ?
[09:22:56] <robertmaxrees> samssh generally.
[09:23:32] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/performance/optimize-selectors/ for some pertinent info.
[09:23:40] <robertmaxrees> i happen to find it more readable.
[09:29:33] <Omar-> WorkBox http://animateyourhtml5.appspot.com/pres/index.html?lang=en#1
[09:34:53] <momomo> i am inserting a textarea with a value, right after i have a script that runs on that exact element .. textarea.value has content.. however, textarea.scollHeight is zero... if I do setTimeout( .., 1) to get the scrollheight it is set .. but this feels like possilby buggy way to approach this ... how can I ensure the textare is visible on the page?
[09:35:17] <robertmaxrees> using a document ready maybe?
[09:35:17] <momomo> i have tried jQuery(document).ready .. and jQuery(textearea).ready .. but to no avail
[09:35:34] <robertmaxrees> can you share your code?
[09:36:19] <jfive> a doc ready would look like: $(document).ready(function() { ... });
[09:36:58] <robertmaxrees> i trust they had it correct in their code, but sharing the code out would help us see :)
[09:37:07] <robertmaxrees> also, .ready() really only works for the document iirc.
[09:37:08] <jfive> robertmaxrees: agreed!
[09:37:40] <robertmaxrees> "The .ready() method can only be called on a jQuery object matching the current document, so the selector can be omitted." yeah
[09:37:44] <momomo> robertmaxrees, i am working on an example
[09:37:51] <robertmaxrees> awesome!
[09:39:01] <jfive> question for everyone... if i need to determine if a url results in a 404... is it best to do that in php or in an ajax call?
[09:39:14] <jfive> what are the pros/cons, i guess is my question
[09:39:25] <robertmaxrees> really depends.
[09:39:32] <robertmaxrees> what's the problem you're actually trying to solve?
[09:39:41] <jfive> would there be security concerns with checking for a 404 via ajax?
[09:39:55] <jfive> i am literally just trying to determine if the URL request returns 404 or not
[09:40:02] <robertmaxrees> why though?
[09:40:10] <jfive> so i can either show an "expired" message, or show the video at the end of the URL
[09:40:50] <robertmaxrees> PHP i guess.
[09:40:56] <robertmaxrees> don't rely on doing something like that via ajax.
[09:41:02] <robertmaxrees> that feels hacky to me either way.
[09:41:04] <jfive> that was my determination too...
[09:41:25] <jfive> but the client's technical dept has requested that i do it via ajax "to help have less page load time"
[09:41:39] <robertmaxrees> that makes no sense.
[09:41:42] <jfive> i was just checking my sanity heh
[09:41:53] <jfive> agreed, but that's how it goes working with big companies lol...
[09:42:00] <robertmaxrees> (i'm one of those big companies ;)
[09:42:11] <jfive> Robert Max Rees, Inc.
[09:42:13] <jfive> hehe jk
[09:42:42] <jfive> oh i wasn't implying that it's always the case with big companies... lol
[09:42:46] <jfive> but it does seem to happen often
[09:43:02] <jfive> oh well, i'll do it their way, it doesn't seem to be a huge deal etiher way so no point fighting it
[09:46:53] <momomo> robertmaxrees, i am unable to provide a working example on jsbin or jsfiddle .. they don't allow for script tags in the html
[09:49:52] <robertmaxrees> there's an external resources section on the left.

[09:56:11] <basichash> I need a carousel that has infinite scroll (for the thumbnails) and that is extremely responsive? i've tried bootstrap carousel, but it's too slow and there are no thumbnails. Any suggestions?
[10:04:50] <jfive> momomo: http://jsfiddle.net/2jLg5f67/
[10:04:51] <robertmaxrees> momomo http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fhh458a5/1/
[10:04:54] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[10:05:02] <jfive> same here, works fine
[10:06:26] <jfive> http://jsfiddle.net/242hc2om/1/ <-- with the alert in place and corrected html (you had <textearea> instead of <textarea>)
[10:11:27] <adavia> is this fine? $('input[name=primary]:checked').val('on') : true ? false;
[10:11:56] <robertmaxrees> eeeh.
[10:12:04] <robertmaxrees> not what you want.
[10:12:09] <robertmaxrees> .val() === 'on'
[10:12:11] <adavia> umm
[10:12:17] <adavia> ohh i see
[10:12:19] <robertmaxrees> otherwise that'll always return true.
[10:12:27] <adavia> yeah make sense
[10:12:33] <robertmaxrees> and give the input a class, instead of having to do an attribute selector.
[10:12:52] <adavia> robertmaxrees:  whats the difference
[10:12:59] <robertmaxrees> attribute selectors are slow.
[10:13:21] <robertmaxrees> input[name=primary] involves extra parsing that .primary-name doesn't, especially for older browsers.
[10:13:31] <adavia> shit i have used attribute selectors everywhere
[10:13:49] <Uhkis> what's the fastest way to select an inputs label?
[10:13:58] <robertmaxrees> if you absolutely have to use them, scope them down as much as possible adavia
[10:14:16] <Uhkis> is there another way than attribute selector?
[10:14:35] <robertmaxrees> Uhkis wrap the input in the label, and then .parent() or .closest() :)
[10:14:42] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, scope to the form and start there.
[10:15:05] <adavia> robertmaxrees: i use them to avoid having a bunch of ids and css classes in my html. Not for any particular good reason
[10:15:53] <Uhkis> adavia: you really should use ids and classes instead
[10:16:25] <NoiseEee> adavia: ids and classes are good things to have, esp when you're manipulating the DOM / doing JS
[10:16:27] <Uhkis> way easier to select and style
[10:17:10] <robertmaxrees> ^
[10:17:15] <robertmaxrees> that's what IDs and classes are for.
[10:17:18] <robertmaxrees> pretty names that make things easier.
[10:17:40] <robertmaxrees> imagine just typing $('.first-name') instead of $('input[name="first"]');
[10:17:47] <jimi_> Does .data() not read/write after the first time?
[10:18:02] <robertmaxrees> jimi_ it creates a cached version outside of the DOM.
[10:18:25] <robertmaxrees> it reads/writes from that instead.  your inspector won't accurately reflect the value.
[10:18:27] <jimi_> robertmaxrees, oh, no wonder.... i was going crazy... because i would check it and it would show it changed, but when i inspect it in the dom, i trident.
[10:18:42] <robertmaxrees> aye - don't trust the inspector when using .data()
[10:18:47] <adavia> so if i use the same class in all my forms i have to create an extra class or id to submit them
[10:18:56] <robertmaxrees> adavia huh?
[10:19:09] <adavia> same class for my css
[10:19:14] <jimi_> robertmaxrees, should i use .attr('data-foo',3') then?
[10:19:19] <robertmaxrees> jimi_ noooo
[10:19:35] <robertmaxrees> use .data() - it's faster.
[10:19:40] <robertmaxrees> verify using the console.
[10:20:18] <jimi_> robertmaxrees, well, i am reading from it in console, and it shows its changed, however, i have a method that uses event.target.dataset.from; and it isn't showing changed there
[10:20:51] <robertmaxrees> because that's not the same as using .data()
[10:20:56] <robertmaxrees> $(event.target).data()
[10:21:11] <robertmaxrees> you have to be consistent and always use .data()
[10:23:27] <hetii> Hi
[10:23:30] <hetii> Q: noob question: for eg I have some library like slick that is bind on DOM by jquery selector like this: $('.single-item').slick(); What if I want to use requirejs instead and have: var Slick = require('slick'); ?
[10:24:05] <robertmaxrees> you have to use a weird shim to make jquery a dependency of slick.
[10:24:27] <hetii> what you mean ?
[10:24:55] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/requirejs/example-jquery-shim
[10:25:23] <robertmaxrees> also: ake jquery a dependency of slick.
[10:25:24] <robertmaxrees> [2015:03:27:10:24:27] <hetii> what you mean ?
[10:25:24] <robertmaxrees> [2015:03:27:10:24:39] * prasunanand (~prasun@103.225.100.51) has joi
[10:25:28] <robertmaxrees> woops http://unitstep.net/blog/2014/03/21/requirejs-shim-configuration-jquery-plugins-and-enforcedefine/
[10:25:32] <robertmaxrees> lots of reading material.
[10:25:49] <hetii> huh :(
[10:25:57] <robertmaxrees> what part are you lost on?
[10:27:46] <hetii> General I try figure out how to build a site based on current framework, at first plan I decide to build it via reactjs and flux but after that I found http://www.jflux.io and decide to use it instead because there are more ready to use jquery plugins
[10:28:31] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:34:03] <momomo> robertmaxrees, i think you are both missing het point here .. the script is right after the textarea
[10:34:13] <robertmaxrees> momomo why?
[10:34:20] <momomo> jsfiddle does this by appending a separate script
[10:34:26] <momomo> robertmaxrees, why not?
[10:34:29] <momomo> i have my reasons
[10:34:32] <robertmaxrees> separations of concern.
[10:34:35] <robertmaxrees> js should be in js files.
[10:34:40] <momomo> really, let me not go into that
[10:34:43] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:34:45] <momomo> discussion
[10:34:48] <robertmaxrees> except that it fixes your bug.
[10:35:21] <momomo> robertmaxrees, yes thats true .. but it is only by happening later .. if i do setTimout(..., 1) it also fixes the issue
[10:35:30] <robertmaxrees> which is a hack.
[10:35:45] <robertmaxrees> so move the code into a separate file where it belongs and everybody is happy /shrug
[10:36:06] <momomo> robertmaxrees, if you have an element .. or a popup box .. where you have defined the html
[10:36:50] <momomo> do you consider it inapproopiate to place the associated javascript, or even css in relation to that piece? wouldn't the separation to global files actually be less organized?
[10:37:07] <robertmaxrees> i would place those in appropriately named files.
[10:37:14] <robertmaxrees> separate from the html.
[10:37:17] <momomo> after 8 years of web development experience this is the path i found to be most managable
[10:37:28] <robertmaxrees> i highly disagree.
[10:37:41] <momomo> robertmaxrees, why? the html is there, the js shoudl be there, the styling should be there
[10:37:46] <momomo> why separate files?
[10:37:51] <robertmaxrees> you're throwing developers accross huge sections of your codebase to find where the styling may or may not be coming from.
[10:37:56] <momomo> that only complicates things
[10:38:13] <robertmaxrees> you also miss out on a lot of tooling to minify your CSS and JS, and you end up having to change things in 15 places, instead of 1
[10:38:21] <robertmaxrees> it also helps avoid bugs, like this one.
[10:38:29] <momomo> no.. they will immediately know where it came from. it came from the exact same place where the html came from
[10:38:42] <robertmaxrees> any developer i work with would not think to look there.
[10:38:52] <robertmaxrees> because markup is markup.
[10:38:58] <robertmaxrees> not where we put CSS and JS
[10:39:27] <ryanneufeld> momomo: robertmaxrees is right, it's common practice, and best practice to separate your files
[10:39:36] <momomo> i disaggree .. btw, i also scan the html files and pull out the js and css into a global file so that they can be preprocessed and minifed
[10:39:46] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[10:39:50] <momomo> ryanneufeld, since when is common practice the best?
[10:39:58] <momomo> standards have suck for a long time
[10:39:59] <robertmaxrees> flawed argument.
[10:40:07] <robertmaxrees> it's not best BECAUSE it's common.
[10:40:15] <ryanneufeld> it's common because it's best
[10:40:38] <ryanneufeld> if putting it all in one file was best, google, apple, ms, et al, would do it that way
[10:40:58] <ryanneufeld> we'd have million line c files
[10:41:03] <momomo> btw, any developer working in my environment needs only to be told this rule.. check the html file and you will find it.. in fact, i have a strict rule against any global events .. all bindings and what not must come from the html js
[10:41:21] <robertmaxrees> how large of a team do you work with?
[10:41:21] <ryanneufeld> momomo: I seriously hope that I never have to work in your environmen
[10:41:33] <momomo> ryanneufeld, lets throw in microsoft in that mix .. and ibm
[10:41:38] <ryanneufeld> momomo: I did
[10:41:58] <momomo> i was joking
[10:41:59] <ryanneufeld> momomo: so, do you have copy and pasted code in each file?
[10:42:16] <momomo> ryanneufeld, no.. global methods are in one place
[10:42:21] <momomo> and they call those
[10:42:23] <momomo> if needed
[10:42:24] <robertmaxrees> wat.
[10:42:26] <ryanneufeld> I thought you said, you don't allow globals
[10:42:38] <robertmaxrees> that sounds so bizarre.
[10:42:38] <momomo> i don't allow global event binding
[10:42:39] <momomo> s
[10:42:46] <ryanneufeld> are you the team lead?
[10:42:50] <momomo> not really, it's actually fantastic
[10:43:07] <robertmaxrees> i've worked in codebases similar to that, and people spun their wheels CONSTANTLY.
[10:43:11] <momomo> i am working on my own shit nowadays
[10:43:20] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you're working against some other kind of problem at that point.
[10:43:21] <ryanneufeld> wait, people are paying you for this?
[10:43:25] <momomo> no,
[10:43:30] <momomo> i am wokring for myself
[10:43:37] <momomo> my own project
[10:44:53] <momomo> can i show you a quick template to see what I am working on?
[10:44:59] <ryanneufeld> if you like
[10:45:02] <robertmaxrees> in any event, i can't replicate your bug, even using your strange inline JS stuff.
[10:46:00] <momomo> I think it is due to me populating the that html dynamically, after the dom has actually loaded ... i wrote a function to take care of that .. so now we are safe.
[10:46:11] <robertmaxrees> ...
[10:46:28] <robertmaxrees> you should just have a callback in the function that writes that out to handle that then.,
[10:46:42] <robertmaxrees> telling us that information would've been really helpful.
[10:46:48] <momomo> here is a sample: http://hastebin.com/hatipiriqi.xml
[10:47:11] <ryanneufeld> ew
[10:47:15] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:47:29] <momomo> you guys have no idea
[10:47:33] <robertmaxrees> HAHAHAHAHA
[10:47:36] <ryanneufeld> ROFL
[10:47:37] <momomo> hh
[10:47:44] <momomo> but seriously you dont
[10:47:51] <robertmaxrees> believe what you want ;)
[10:47:56] <momomo> you will see, remember this nickname ;)
[10:48:00] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I've only built a site that still serves 50mil uniques a month
[10:48:15] <ryanneufeld> and has minimal inline JS
[10:48:48] <robertmaxrees> and i work for the largest home improvement ecommerce shop in the US.  no way i'd know what i'm talking about.
[10:49:14] <ryanneufeld> I was responsible for hiring developers (front and back end)
[10:49:20] <robertmaxrees> nice
[10:49:34] <ryanneufeld> and if any of them tried to pass off what you're selling, they'd be asked to change it
[10:49:44] <momomo> but you guys have just seen one template.. it's premature to judge it like that ..
[10:49:49] <ryanneufeld> I mean, I likely wouldn't have even hired them
[10:50:08] <ryanneufeld> momomo: you're right, and that template tells us literally nothing, beyond the fact that you've got inline css
[10:50:19] <robertmaxrees> *and inline js
[10:50:23] <ryanneufeld> That too
[10:50:28] <momomo> ryanneufeld, which is lifted out into a the main.css
[10:50:35] <momomo> the location is however only local
[10:50:41] <momomo> declaration*
[10:50:42] <ryanneufeld> so the is pre-processed ?
[10:50:43] <robertmaxrees> that really doesn't make any sense to me.
[10:51:06] <robertmaxrees> why not juse open the CSS file?  i feel like this encourages less code re-use.
[10:51:08] <momomo> ryanneufeld, yes.. it takes no time.. i run it like that in development mode and that works fine
[10:51:25] <momomo> robertmaxrees, the problem i usually face is ever growing css files
[10:51:28] <ryanneufeld> but, if you didn't do it inline, you wouldn't even have to process it
[10:51:41] <robertmaxrees> momomo that sounds like bad CSS use to me.
[10:51:41] <ryanneufeld> which means less opportunity for bugs to get in
[10:51:55] <robertmaxrees> if that's your problem, then you need better documentation and style guides.
[10:52:00] <momomo> but why declare it somewhere else? please give me a valid argument .. when the only location it is applied is that html piece?
[10:52:12] <ryanneufeld> performance
[10:52:15] <robertmaxrees> do you use onclick="" in your HTML?
[10:52:15] <momomo> i want a logical answer, not because it is a common or standard answer
[10:52:19] <momomo> no
[10:52:21] <robertmaxrees> why?
[10:52:35] <robertmaxrees> it places the code exactly where it's getting used.
[10:52:53] <momomo> robertmaxrees, true, but i have access to the entire element on the next row
[10:53:02] <momomo> so I can do whatever I want tehre ..
[10:53:08] <momomo> with that element
[10:53:15] <robertmaxrees> so abstracting that out is smart?
[10:53:15] <ryanneufeld> do you have js interspersed in your markup?
[10:53:30] <robertmaxrees> he's preprocessing this and pushing it into files i'm guessing.
[10:53:32] <momomo> interspersed, what does that mean?
[10:53:58] <ryanneufeld> in the middle of your document
[10:54:04] <ryanneufeld> instead of in head or at the end
[10:54:13] <ryanneufeld> <script> tags through out the doc
[10:54:14] <momomo> also the <m::render stuff is a js template engine i have written..
[10:54:51] <momomo> http://hastebin.com/meporikoze.xml
[10:54:56] <robertmaxrees> i can totally see the problems you're trying to solve here, but I have never seen these setups work well.
[10:55:10] <momomo> when I render the from I actually render one of the globals here: http://hastebin.com/meporikoze.xml
[10:55:33] <momomo> robertmaxrees, i understand .. but what I am doing is solving it real good here
[10:56:03] <momomo> and it works really really well, right now
[10:56:04] <robertmaxrees> i really don't see how.
[10:56:08] <robertmaxrees> that looks really confusing and convoluted.
[10:56:26] <robertmaxrees> it feels like you're fighting against your platform.
[10:56:55] <momomo> robertmaxrees, i am creating a new platform
[10:57:11] <robertmaxrees> best of luck then, i guess.
[10:57:19] <momomo> :D
[10:58:10] <ryanneufeld> do you have <script> tags through out your html?
[10:58:42] <ryanneufeld> momomo: ^ ?
[11:00:24] <momomo> ryanneufeld, usually a script tag is placed right after the whatever element you need to, using: <m::js> ... </m::js> .. that will output a <script id="randomid">
[11:00:27] <b-ot> momomo: No output.
[11:00:41] <ryanneufeld> so, you know why that's very bad right?
[11:00:48] <momomo> no..
[11:00:52] <momomo> why?
[11:00:57] <ryanneufeld> every time teh browser sees a script tag
[11:01:01] <ryanneufeld> it stops rendering the page
[11:01:04] <ryanneufeld> and executes the JS
[11:01:13] <ryanneufeld> blocking ANY other jS from running
[11:01:20] <ryanneufeld> it's a very bad thing
[11:01:25] <ryanneufeld> inline css does the same thing
[11:01:33] <robertmaxrees> plus it's way less readable imo.
[11:01:41] <ryanneufeld> teh browser stops to process it, apply the changes, and reflows the page
[11:01:49] <robertmaxrees> forcing people to context switch like that is funky.
[11:01:52] <momomo> robertmaxrees, the source might be less readable .. but hte actual development code
[11:01:55] <ryanneufeld> robertmaxrees: That argument will not work with him
[11:01:58] <robertmaxrees> i know.
[11:02:04] <momomo> there is no context switching.. thats the point!
[11:02:09] <ryanneufeld> yes, there is
[11:02:11] <robertmaxrees> i'm pointing it out for the sake of every other developer.
[11:02:19] <robertmaxrees> HTML, JS, and CSS all do very different things.
[11:02:21] <ryanneufeld> maybe not to you, but to seasoned professional developers
[11:02:44] <momomo> i am very seasoned .. i am not going to start bragging, but I know my shit
[11:02:55] <robertmaxrees> except that you tried to brag earlier ;)
[11:02:55] <ryanneufeld> pretty much every one of them I know (and I know all the guys on the jquery team) would have the same visceral reaction to this
[11:03:05] <ryanneufeld> momomo: then code like it
[11:03:13] <ryanneufeld> cause you're coding like you've never used HTML before
[11:03:19] <momomo> hh .. only to show my latest creation of which I am proud of .. i've never shared it with anyone before
[11:03:29] <robertmaxrees> you're coding like a backend guy who doesn't understand frontend.
[11:03:39] <robertmaxrees> and thinks they've "fixed" it.
[11:04:23] <momomo> Ook, i will post one library soon on github .. and then you can tell me after trying it how great it is
[11:04:28] <momomo> and that is only one piece
[11:04:34] <momomo> ok?
[11:04:45] <momomo> it's called MoVC
[11:05:17] <ryanneufeld> okay
[11:05:20] <robertmaxrees> that's one hell of an assumption :)
[11:05:26] <ryanneufeld> I can't wait to see it
[11:05:29] <momomo> hh .. it's amazing!
[11:05:41] <ryanneufeld> and how it's gonna be better than all the other js MVC frameworks out there
[11:05:55] <momomo> ryanneufeld, oh, it beats them all
[11:05:56] <ryanneufeld> that don't require inline script tags
[11:06:12] <momomo> ryanneufeld, there are benefits ot inline script tags
[11:06:18] <ryanneufeld> none
[11:06:32] <robertmaxrees> absolutely none.
[11:06:37] <momomo> you don't need live query when the dom changes for one
[11:06:38] <ryanneufeld> momomo: enlighten me
[11:07:08] <ryanneufeld> if you're using jquery inline, you're gonna have a bad time
[11:07:21] <ryanneufeld> and you're setting your implementers up for failure, and slow page loads
[11:08:09] <momomo> ryanneufeld, i haven't noticed any of that .. maybe you have point of the script and style stopping the rendering .. but it's not considerable
[11:08:18] <ryanneufeld> yes it is
[11:08:29] <momomo> i am not really doing heavy js duty on those elements .. nor shoudld you ..
[11:08:38] <ryanneufeld> you're missing the point
[11:08:39] <momomo> ryanneufeld, what do you think of client side rendering?
[11:08:45] <momomo> or underscore?
[11:08:49] <momomo> that is all js
[11:09:01] <ryanneufeld> client side rendering is fine, if done correctly
[11:09:04] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:09:13] <robertmaxrees> don't misapply the technique and you're golden.
[11:09:50] <frank_o> Cork: thanks again man, cya later
[11:10:50] <ryanneufeld> momomo: look at angular, they don't require inline js
[11:11:09] <momomo> ryanneufeld, just go into linkedin ... check the source
[11:11:17] <ryanneufeld>  HAHAHHAHAHA
[11:11:22] <robertmaxrees> oh boy.
[11:11:28] <robertmaxrees> you are not writing the next linkedin.
[11:11:36] <momomo> what do you know?
[11:11:36] <ryanneufeld> linkedin is one of the shittiest sites i've ever used
[11:11:40] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:11:55] <ryanneufeld> using them as an example of 'best practice' is a bad idea
[11:12:16] <momomo> ryanneufeld, the thing with inline js and my code is that I can easily lift part out if I need to.. and then looking up the elements from ...
[11:12:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:12:32] <robertmaxrees> circular arguments!
[11:13:08] <ryanneufeld> momomo: I well and truely wish you luck, but convince me you have not.
[11:13:36] <gsoc-jq-student> hello
[11:13:41] <momomo> robertmaxrees, my argument for doing this are two .. first, the js code should be in relation to the html .. then you can never be confused where certain thing is happening for that html piece .. and you can easily find you starting point.. i am not saying all the code should be in that piece .. it can be a method call
[11:13:49] <robertmaxrees> gsoc-jq-student let me guess - you need google summer of code assistance?
[11:13:51] <momomo> ryanneufeld, :P
[11:14:14] <gsoc-jq-student> robertmaxrees:yes are you the right guy to talk to?
[11:14:27] <robertmaxrees> gsoc-jq-student head on over to #jquery-dev instead.
[11:14:31] <robertmaxrees> this isn't the right place :)
[11:14:52] <gsoc-jq-student> Thank you any idea who i should go talk to there?
[11:15:01] <robertmaxrees> gsoc-jq-student jsut ask in the channel and be patient.
[11:15:07] <gsoc-jq-student> thank you Robertmaxres
[11:15:09] <ryanneufeld> and be patient

[11:15:10] <ryanneufeld> and be patient
[11:15:14] <robertmaxrees> they will help you as soon as they can - keep in mind they all have dayjobs :)
[11:15:45] <gsoc-jq-student> I'll be patient :))))
[11:16:17] <jfive> ha..
[11:16:29] <momomo> ryanneufeld, also on the comment that I am not writing something like linked in... maybe, maybe not .. but what I am writing is something that can grow -> ∞ in a controllable fashion .. when you reach a hude code base .. that is not an easy task.. you want to be able to manage and control it all ..
[11:16:48] <jfive> momomo: you're just wrong, deal with it.
[11:16:57] <robertmaxrees> momomo right - that's exactly the scenario we're used to handling.
[11:16:58] <momomo> alright
[11:17:12] <jfive> script tags cause the rest of the JS to wait, that's all there is to it
[11:17:19] <jfive> nothing you can say can change that, i'm afraid
[11:17:33] <momomo> ok, so that argument is valid
[11:17:37] <ryanneufeld> momomo: it's my professional opinion that you're being delusional. However, when you publish on github, let me know. My username is the same on there. I'd love to have a look
[11:17:44] <ryanneufeld> momomo: prove me wrong!
[11:17:59] <jfive> as far as the managability of the codebase goes, use classnames and id's and you can reference the html vs the js in the external .js file with no problems
[11:18:05] <momomo> i give you that .. and I will lift them out and bind them globally in the end if needed
[11:18:25] <momomo> ryanneufeld, i will :)
[11:18:31] <jfive> better to do it now vs "in the end" when it will be a monumental task
[11:18:41] <robertmaxrees> he has no intention of actually doing it, fwiw
[11:18:47] <jfive> agreed
[11:22:41] <momomo> nice talking to you guys, take care for now :)
[11:36:08] <hetii> ok i give up :/
[11:36:27] <robertmaxrees> sup?
[11:37:20] <hetii> have a code like this: http://pastebin.com/HtpBnchX
[11:37:40] <hetii> try to use dialog from jquery-ui
[11:38:09] <hetii> but A is an empty object and I also get TypeError: $(...).dialog is not a function
[11:38:47] <robertmaxrees> that compile call looks wrong, and you need to define jquery as a dependency for jquery ui.
[11:39:34] <hetii> btw jquery and  jquery-ui was installed by npm in node_modules and from that by gulp task is build a vendor.js
[11:40:27] <hetii> robertmaxrees: the compile is fine, its a part of jflux framework
[11:40:40] <robertmaxrees> no clue then.
[11:40:43] <hetii> I have issue with http://pastebin.com/HtpBnchX
[11:40:45] <hetii> sorry
[11:40:54] <hetii> with $( "#dialog" ).dialog();
[11:40:56] <robertmaxrees> sending the same link isn't helpful :)
[11:41:13] <robertmaxrees> what's the errror you get with that line?
[11:41:23] <hetii> TypeError: $(...).dialog is not a function
[11:41:35] <robertmaxrees> sounds like require isn't setup correctly to handle jquery ui then.
[11:42:33] <hetii> https://www.npmjs.com/package/jquery-ui
[11:42:57] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[11:43:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see a fiddle i guess.
[11:54:25] <step1step2> how is the jquery function called that can animate background particles like it is done here with angular.js: http://codepen.io/step1step2/pen/ogaRMq
[11:54:45] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[11:55:06] <step1step2> i want to know the name so i can take a look at the documentation of jquery
[11:55:15] <robertmaxrees> the name of what?
[11:55:35] <step1step2> animateparticles() doesnt exist i suppose
[11:55:41] <robertmaxrees> i don't see any jquery use in here.
[11:56:14] <step1step2> ?
[11:56:47] <robertmaxrees> i see angular being used, but no jquery.
[11:57:16] <step1step2> http://i.imgur.com/BrX2Qv9.png
[11:57:33] <robertmaxrees> please rephrase the question, then.
[11:58:07] <step1step2> the codepen i just posted is done with angular.js but it is nonsense to sue angular.js for these animation
[11:58:19] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you'd like to do it with jquery instead?
[11:58:19] <step1step2> i just dont know the function name of jquery that can animate
[11:58:24] <step1step2> yes
[11:58:32] <robertmaxrees> well...
[11:58:36] <robertmaxrees> there's .animate()
[12:00:10] <step1step2> anything else?
[12:00:37] <robertmaxrees> http://learn.jquery.com/ is a good resource.
[12:00:48] <robertmaxrees> as is https://api.jquery.com/category/effects/
[12:21:27] <kpl> Using jq mobile Listview widget + jquery.validate: In a form I have a: '<ul id="id1" data-role="listview" data-inset="true" data-filter="true" data-filter-placeholder="Type 3 chars..." data-filter-theme="a"></ul>', then when calling  .valid() for the form, I get "Exception: Cannot read property 'settings' of undefined" in jquery.validate. Is this because the jq mobile Listview widget creates...
[12:21:28] <kpl> ...a form element inside the form, or because of other incompatibilities?
[12:21:28] <step1step2> robertmaxrees: i think i made a syntax error http://kopy.io/kdVm6
[12:21:33] <step1step2> did i?
[12:23:34] <arthurvr> step1step2: It’s not a syteax error but there’s an extra pair of brackets indeed
[12:23:40] <arthurvr> ~syntax
[12:23:48] * arthurvr can’t spell lol
[12:25:09] <step1step2> arthurvr: i missed brackets? where exactly?
[12:25:21] <arthurvr> there’s an extra pair I said
[12:25:52] <arthurvr> You can just write it like this: http://kopy.io/cRKAI
[12:25:54] <arthurvr> step1step2:
[12:26:20] <step1step2> arthurvr, ah now i understand. thanks you very much!
[12:26:29] <arthurvr> You’re welcome step1step2
[12:27:38] <arthurvr> step1step2: This wouldn’t change the behaviour of your code though
[12:29:14] <jfive> wth... an extra parentheses would definitely qualify as a syntax error, and would definitely affect the behavior of the code...
[12:29:40] <step1step2> arthurvr, yeah i dont see any dives with a class of 'particles' xD
[12:30:12] <arthurvr> jfive: This pair wouldn’t.
[12:30:28] <jfive> arthurvr: you're 100% no other code will ever come after that snippet?
[12:31:04] <arthurvr> That’s not important in this case. The pair just wrapped a premitive value, a function.
[12:31:22] <arthurvr> js>> (function() {})
[12:33:42] <arthurvr> jfive: You can wrap it with as many as you want as long as you close them properly: http://imgur.com/2bsmQ6s
[12:33:57] <jfive> step1step2: http://jsfiddle.net/n2daxv21/
[12:34:24] <arthurvr> ^ That actually makes sense.
[12:34:25] <step1step2> jfive: ah that helped l.)
[12:34:28] <jfive> arthurvr: regardless, bad advise to consider doing so best practices. you can't guarantee that will always be the case
[12:34:30] <arthurvr> No syntax error though :D
[12:34:33] <jfive> *advice
[12:34:44] <arthurvr> jfive: In this case you can.
[12:34:54] <decx> what's with the add?
[12:35:35] <arthurvr> jsfive: I didn’t advise it by the way, I said it wasn’t a syntax error.
[12:40:35] <sivam> hi
[12:40:52] <sivam> how do I disable other AJAX calls inside ajaxSend ?
[12:51:59] <DragonPunch> 			    var dropzoneoptions = {
[12:51:59] <DragonPunch> 			    	"clickable": "true"

[12:51:59] <DragonPunch> 			    $("textarea#postmsg").dropzone(dropzoneoptions, {url: "/upload_my_photo"});
[12:52:04] <DragonPunch> what is wrong with that code
[12:52:08] <NoiseEee> not here please DragonPunch
[12:52:27] <NoiseEee> $("textarea#postmsg") should just be #postmsg
[12:52:29] <DragonPunch> crap sorry i thought i had my pastie in my clipboard
[12:52:35] <NoiseEee> assuming you only have one #postmsg in the doc
[12:53:07] <DragonPunch> NoiseEee: yeah i only have one but i get an error in the console let me put it in pasite.
[12:53:18] <NinjaBanjo> sad;;ajksdladfjskfasdjl;kcwcpqwfimojoacqwefuyi
[12:53:18] <NinjaBanjo> 
[12:53:33] <NinjaBanjo> sorry, my irssi F'd up
[12:54:07] <DragonPunch> NoiseEee: Yeah im not getting an error on my console, the thing doesn't work. there is somethign wrong with dropzoneoptions because even if i take out all the elements, it just stops woring
[12:54:11] <DragonPunch> working**
[12:54:26] <NoiseEee> try making a fiddle...
[12:55:05] <step1step2> jfive: oh something is still wrong: http://i.imgur.com/agVoRjL.png xD
[12:55:53] <step1step2> use $(this)?
[12:57:44] <DragonPunch> NoiseEee: i magically fixed it
[12:58:27] <jfive> step1step2: can you put together a jsfiddle?
[12:59:03] <jfive> without a jsfiddle, or more information as to what is happening, i can't be of any assistance
[12:59:19] <step1step2> jfive, nvm i just noticed it doesn't make sense to create a div using jquery when i can simply create the div in my view xD
[13:02:01] <NoiseEee> DragonPunch: thatnk goodness for magic
[13:08:04] <robertmaxrees> weeeee
[13:52:17] <djQuery> using jqm column chooser columns arent shown after a reset?

[14:16:46] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to make an ajax request but firefox block the request because is in other port. I configured apache headers and the php app headers, but seems that the problem is that is the browser that blocks this. Any suggestion please?
[14:19:50] <robertmaxrees> abailarri CORS
[14:19:55] <robertmaxrees> the server has to allow cross-domain requests.
[14:20:06] <robertmaxrees> *cross-domain includes different ports.
[14:20:52] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, see my apache config: http://pastebin.com/hwU6aNPS
[14:21:07] <abailarri> is configured to accept all
[14:21:22] <robertmaxrees> http://enable-cors.org/server_apache.html
[14:21:34] <robertmaxrees> though be aware of the ramifications of doing this.
[14:23:52] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, do you think that is apache problem?
[14:24:00] <abailarri> is not client side problem?
[14:24:11] <robertmaxrees> what is the specific error you're getting in FF?
[14:25:03] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, the url not resolves and firefox shows that a meesage saying that the request has blocked
[14:25:41] <robertmaxrees> "the url not resolves" - so you opened a separate window and tried to hit that URL?
[14:27:49] <abailarri> yes in separate window works the url
[14:28:01] <abailarri> robertmaxrees,
[14:28:33] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see the actual error, because something isn't adding up here.
[14:33:45] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, http://nsae02.casimages.net/img/2015/03/27/15032710345365618.png
[14:34:23] <robertmaxrees> i really wish i could read whatever language that is, but I see "CORS" mentioned, so I assume it's saying that it was blocked because of CORS.
[14:35:27] <robertmaxrees> that means it's a server problem.
[14:36:36] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, it says:
[14:36:36] <abailarri> Multisource blocked a request. The same origin policy prevents reading the remote resourcehttp://intranet.dev:9999/api/1/deletePad?apikey=4d0df0aaca4f016e92bfbbf6b92daff4336ae08d06c425946c4d573e98f86369&padID=21. This can be fixed by moving the resource in the same domain or enabling the CORS.
[14:36:45] <robertmaxrees> yep.  that's a server issue.
[14:37:11] <abailarri> but how can be server, if in the vhost I putted the headers?
[14:37:27] <robertmaxrees> you don't have it configured correctly.
[14:37:50] <robertmaxrees> that error means the server isn't allowing cross-domain requests.  so you need to fix the server.
[14:55:56] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, I see that when I load the page the CORS headers comes, but when I make the ajax request, the server not sends COTS
[14:55:58] <abailarri> CORS*
[14:57:35] <abailarri> how is possible?
[14:57:45] <robertmaxrees> because that URL isn't responding with the correct headers.
[15:01:47] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, do you mean that CORS actues with some URL and with other URL no?
[15:06:56] <robertmaxrees> Your server is misconfigured.
[15:07:01] <robertmaxrees> i don't know how else i can phrase that.
[15:07:06] <robertmaxrees> your issue is your server,
[15:13:59] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, may be the php app?
[15:14:04] <robertmaxrees> maybe?
[15:14:40] <abailarri> I mean, the issue can be with php app or with apache, no?
[15:14:49] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[15:15:02] <robertmaxrees> the issue is somewhere on your server.
[15:24:00] <abailarri> robertmaxrees, another solution is to put the service that is in port 9999 in a reverse proxy, no?
[15:24:28] <robertmaxrees> if you were able to expose it on the same port/protocol/domain as the page, then yeah,.
[16:03:25] <user_corrupt> I am currently doing a "jQuery('#primary').html("Thank you for voting!");" in order to change the content of a div… is there a way to use that same line of code to change the content to another page on the same domain (https://www.intellipolls.com/app)?
[17:28:28] <se_busca_ayuda> So I keep getting an error of “this.source is not a function” with this javascript. i managed to keep the console from saying “$ is not defined” as well http://hastebin.com/tabovewube.js
[17:29:22] <rcyr> se_busca_ayuda: That code doesn't make any sense.
[17:29:41] <rcyr> A "ready" cannot be in a onload
[17:29:59] <rcyr> And line 7  is?
[17:30:36] <se_busca_ayuda> having trouble accessing jQuery from my main.js file when it’s declared before that in the index.html
[17:33:00] <se_busca_ayuda> ok i took out the .ready(). still doesn’t work
[17:35:31] <krasimir> hi all , http://pastebin.com/uzA6RyGw how do I get this when calling the funcion inline ?

[17:52:11] <AtomicB0mB> Hi, I have a list (<ul>) that has its itens(<li>) and inside the lis, i have an image and a caption (<p>). When the user hove the mouse it shows the caption, and when the use click on it, i have this modal that shows the image (bigger) and the caption again. The thing is, my client wants to use a different caption for the click action. Any tip ? www.joyncorp.com/homologacao (go to portfolio)
[17:53:37] <AtomicB0mB> i get the caption from the original li. something like $(this).find(p).text();
[18:14:32] <peterbsmith> Hi all
[18:15:13] <peterbsmith> I have an input <input type="datetime-local" id="date" name="user_date">
[18:15:25] <peterbsmith> my goal is to give it a value
[18:15:36] <peterbsmith> I achieve that with $("#date").val("2014-03-12T13T09");
[18:15:58] <peterbsmith> pardon
[18:16:04] <peterbsmith> I achieve that with $("#date").attr("value", "2014-03-12T13T09");
[18:16:41] <peterbsmith> What happening is, once that value is set, the #date doesn’t refresh
[18:16:48] <peterbsmith> it has that value, but it does not appear on screen
[18:16:51] <peterbsmith> and i’d like it to
[18:16:52] <peterbsmith> thoughts?
[18:23:55] <Colin_> hey guys quick question
[18:24:20] <Colin_> how can I overlay and image onto another image using CSS? I know this is not the right chat but I am having trouble and could use some help.
[18:26:29] <peterbsmith> I’m still learning
[18:26:56] <peterbsmith> but one way i could imagine it working is to combine absolute/fixed positioning with z-index
[18:27:08] <peterbsmith> though thats not robust
[18:36:12] <Rangedboyke> anyone active here?
[18:37:28] <peterbsmith> hi
[18:37:51] <Rangedboyke> omg :/
[18:38:15] <Rangedboyke>  Hi, does anyone know how I can add more values to the contactOptions.filter? I can only find out how to filter on one name for example (contactOptions.filter = "bob"). But I do want to filter also on "Jeroen" for example. - I'm using phonegap (no-one active there).
[20:20:02] <se_busca_ayuda> finally figured it out guys, just needed to flush the cache on my browser!
[20:43:04] <TeddyMurray> hi,  $(window).on('hashchange', function() {alert('test'); }); -- found this in a stackoverflow answer but it doesn't seem to work, has the event changed?
[21:09:00] <NinjaBanjo> TeddyMurray: http://api.jquery.com/category/events/ don't think thats an event
[21:23:36] <vx> hi, is $(this a) valid ?
[21:36:53] <TeddyMurray> vx, no, there are a few ways to do it but i would use $(this).find("a");
[21:37:25] <TeddyMurray> or i think $(this,'a') will work too
[21:38:02] <TeddyMurray> this is a javascript keyword so it can't be in quotes
[21:39:39] <TeddyMurray> or it won't be recognized as the object
[21:42:08] <NinjaBanjo> TeddyMurray: anything in quotes will be a string
[21:42:17] <NinjaBanjo> a string primitive to be exact
[21:42:20] <TeddyMurray> yes

[23:20:27] <Mixxit> hey guys
[23:21:16] <Mixxit> i have a function that empties a table and makes an ajax call to fill it again
[23:21:39] <Mixxit> but i have to put the .empty() inside the success of the ajax call and not before it else it doesnt empty the table
[23:21:43] <Mixxit> ever seen that before and know why?
