[03:46:41] <codecutter> know of any good emoticon libs?
[07:48:56] <ahiru> hello there
[07:49:33] <ahiru> how do I type "if this parent element has exactly 2 children"?
[07:49:47] <ahiru> or less
[08:03:29] <Cork> ahiru: $(this).children().length < 3
[08:04:02] <ahiru> oh thanks!
[08:04:44] <Cork> children() can take a selector if you want to only count some of them
[08:06:04] <ahiru> .children($('element')) like this?
[08:06:57] <Cork> you don't need the $() wrapper
[08:07:11] <ahiru> oh
[08:07:18] <Cork> .children('div:not(.directions)').length
[08:10:26] <ahiru> ohh
[08:34:58] <ahiru> how do I copy the alt attribute from the images and "paste" into a title attribute?
[08:36:19] <ahiru> $(this).attr('title', 'altAttr');
[08:37:28] <ahiru> should I do: var altAttr = $('.image').attr('alt'); ?
[08:39:56] <Cork> ahiru: $(this).attr('title', $(this).attr('alt')) or $(this).attr('title', function() { return this.alt; })
[08:40:10] <Cork> they basically do the same thing
[08:40:21] <Cork> the later has the advantage that it works for multiple images
[08:40:30] <ahiru> oh
[08:40:37] <Cork> $('img').attr('title', function() { return this.alt; })
[08:40:45] <Cork> would set the title to alt for all images in the page
[08:40:55] <Cork> and not just the same alt but the images own alt :)
[08:41:17] <ahiru> ohh
[08:44:17] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/Lrgw3usv/2/
[08:52:17] <ahiru> oh, I also tried to do the same using other attributes, like srcset, but it didn't work
[08:52:18] <ahiru> https://jsfiddle.net/61x4qzey/
[08:52:49] <Cork> src doesn't have the same format as srcset
[08:53:00] <ahiru> oh no?
[08:54:20] <Cork> srcset is "url size, url size, ..."
[08:54:32] <ahiru> oh
[08:54:39] <ahiru> I didn't notice that
[08:54:51] <Cork> so if you just have a src you don't need to use srcset it won't give you any benifits
[08:55:52] <Cork> ahiru: http://devdoc.net/web/developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img.html#Example_3_Using_the_srcset_attribute
[10:16:59] <ahiru> hmm
[10:17:19] <ahiru> now I created some extra code, which I think it's better to visualize
[10:17:21] <ahiru> https://jsfiddle.net/n5ur0vcm/
[10:18:27] <ahiru> I'm doing a lot of manipulation there, but the JS lines 7-11 are defective
[10:18:53] <ahiru> the html there cannot really be changed
[10:22:23] <ahiru> my objective there is to convert data-flickity-lazyload to src
[13:22:10] <Phruis> hello
[13:22:40] <Phruis> i am trying to figure out if its possible to change the view back to resource view from list view
[13:22:48] <Phruis> i know not exactly jquery
[13:23:02] <robertmaxrees> are you working with some framework or soemthing?
[13:23:27] <robertmaxrees> those aren't apart of the core library, which is why i ask Phruis
[13:23:36] <Phruis> https://fullcalendar.io/
[13:24:29] <robertmaxrees> mm - this isn't a jquery thing :/
[13:24:39] <Phruis> alright thanks any way
[13:34:33] <Uhkis> it used to be!
[13:34:53] <robertmaxrees> not saying it never was, just that currently it isn't :)
[13:37:58] <robertmaxrees> unles Phruis you're using some older version?
[18:02:04] <snackoverflow> anyone hiring?
[18:58:26] <ahiiru> hi
[18:58:55] <robertmaxrees> hello
[18:58:56] <ahiiru> how do I convert an element's attr to text?
[18:59:14] <robertmaxrees> ahiiru it's likely already text :)
[18:59:21] <ahiiru> hmm
[18:59:29] <robertmaxrees> what's the actual bug you're having?
[19:00:10] <ahiiru> https://codepen.io/felipemotand/pen/pogqRea
[19:00:26] <robertmaxrees> soooo what's the bug?
[19:00:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:00:40] <ahiiru> I'm trying to make the two images' data-flickity-lazyload to become src
[19:01:41] <ahiiru> the line 17 is just a test
[19:01:44] <robertmaxrees> well, you have a few issues.
[19:02:13] <robertmaxrees> 1: you're doing imageDetached.each(function () { and then trying to manipulate the same element in that callback.
[19:02:45] <robertmaxrees> 2: if you're going to use a function for setting that attr, you don't need the each to begin with.
[19:03:24] <robertmaxrees> just change the body of the function getting passed to .attr() to be return $(this).atrr('data-flickity-lazyload');
[19:05:27] <robertmaxrees> also, 3: var imageDetached = $("#galeria .wpb_wrapper > img"); isn't selecting anything. ahiiru
[19:06:29] <ahiiru> 3: it's selecting the element after it was moved at the line 5
[19:07:07] <robertmaxrees> heh - it's not though.  that object doesn't automatically update.
[19:07:24] <robertmaxrees> you have to select it after you moved them, or change your selector to actually get the elements in the first place.
[19:08:10] <robertmaxrees> do a console.log(imageDetached.length) after that append and you'll see what's up ehre :)
[19:09:30] <robertmaxrees> ahiiru
[19:10:03] <ahiiru> hmm
[19:10:12] <robertmaxrees> selectors don't update.
[19:11:18] <robertmaxrees> also: $(this).attr('src', function() {
[19:11:25] <robertmaxrees> don't change the selector for that line.
[19:11:56] <ahiiru> ok
[19:12:33] <robertmaxrees> and actually, you're still going to have issues with that selector.
[19:14:58] <robertmaxrees> ah wait okay - last issue is this: $(imageDetached.attr('data-flickity-lazyload')).appendTo('span');
[19:15:19] <robertmaxrees> jquery is trying to parse that url.  just flip it and use .append() off $('span')
[19:15:36] <ahiiru> I think my code went upside down by now lol
[19:15:48] <ahiiru> I saved it
[19:16:06] <robertmaxrees> https://codepen.io/robertmaxrees/pen/JjGwpxB
[19:16:29] <robertmaxrees> though for what it's worth...
[19:17:09] <ahiiru> uhm
[19:17:19] <robertmaxrees> sorry 1 sec.
[19:19:12] <robertmaxrees> something weird is going on here...
[19:19:31] <ahiiru> well
[19:19:54] <ahiiru> do you know the way to make data-flickity-lazyload become src?
[19:20:29] <robertmaxrees> i'm going to help you get there ;)
[19:21:28] <ahiiru> oh ok
[19:21:47] <robertmaxrees> for some reason imageSlider.attr('src', function() {}); isn't working.
[19:23:50] <ahiiru> hm
[19:24:18] <robertmaxrees> funky.  yeah, moving elements around doesn't work the way i remember haha
[19:24:20] <robertmaxrees> been a minute.
[19:25:11] <robertmaxrees> lmao oh.
[19:25:37] <robertmaxrees> misspelled that function body somewhere :)
[19:25:37] <robertmaxrees> return $(this).attr('data-flickity-lazyload');
[19:25:41] <robertmaxrees> it's atrr right now.
[19:25:49] <robertmaxrees> either way: https://codepen.io/robertmaxrees/pen/JjGwpxB?editors=1010
[19:25:51] <robertmaxrees> simplified.
[19:26:51] <ahiiru> hmm
[19:27:13] <ahiiru> ohh
[19:27:22] <ahiiru> it got shorter indeed!
[19:27:32] <ahiiru> let me investigate this
[19:27:33] <robertmaxrees> didn't need to do all that .detach() and whatnot.
[19:27:42] <robertmaxrees> once you have the elements you need, you're good to go.
[19:29:15] <ahiiru> line 7 is quite hard to decipher
[19:29:30] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[19:29:57] <ahiiru> we are doing a function to write a src
[19:30:11] <ahiiru> so we return an attr
[19:30:14] <ahiiru> oohhh inside
[19:30:23] <ahiiru> attr becomes src
[19:30:32] <ahiiru> does it replace or adds it up?
[19:30:52] <ahiiru> ohh it got added
[19:31:04] <robertmaxrees> you're saying "replace the src attribute with whatever gets returned from the function)
[19:31:06] <robertmaxrees> "
[19:31:22] <robertmaxrees> in the function, you're returning the value of that data attribute.
[19:31:30] <ahiiru> hmm
[19:32:12] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with doing, say, $('foo').attr('src', 'someUrl.jpg') ?
[19:32:31] <ahiiru> yes
[19:32:51] <robertmaxrees> exact same idea, but now you're using a function instead of that someUrl.jpg
[19:32:56] <ahiiru> ohhh
[19:32:58] <ahiiru> I see now!
[19:33:11] <ahiiru> the second value is a function!
[19:33:23] <robertmaxrees> second argument is.
[19:33:23] <ahiiru> 'src', then function()
[19:33:27] <ahiiru> argument*
[19:33:30] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[19:33:32] <ahiiru> hehe
[19:33:49] <ahiiru> then line 12 hmm
[19:33:56] <ahiiru> ooh ok
[19:34:02] <ahiiru> the link as a text
[19:34:20] <robertmaxrees> right.  you can't use appendTo like you were because jquery was confused about what it was seeing.
[19:34:33] <ahiiru> oh
[19:34:36] <ahiiru> my mistake hehe
[19:38:10] <robertmaxrees> worth it to get used to having your dev tools open and using console.log regularly.
[19:50:07] <ahiiru> hm
[19:50:36] <ahiiru> thanks, my code is working at the environment :D
[19:50:41] <robertmaxrees> cool
