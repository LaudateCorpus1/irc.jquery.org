[02:13:03] <senaps> http://paste.ubuntu.com/24497079/ why is this code isn't using ajax submit and refreshes the page?
[02:28:00] <senaps> http://paste.ubuntu.com/24497079/ why is this code isn't using ajax submit and refreshes the page?
[02:50:12] <Cork> senaps: domElement.submit != jquery.submit
[02:50:38] <Cork> so currently you're forcing a form submit that does the default action for the form
[02:50:49] <Cork> bind the submit handler separately and do $(this.form).submit()
[02:56:06] <tariqali> https://jsfiddle.net/1fz5gdt4/ — I’m using both jQuery Validation plugin and jQuery UI. The first part of my form allow users to “Select Your School”, but I want to validate that a user actually has selected a school. Right now, no validations are being applied, and I don’t know why.
[02:57:21] <tariqali> I also have a custom combobox to allow for autocomplete.
[02:59:46] <tariqali> Validations works fine if I disable the combobox. It’s only when I have the combobox that things break.
[02:59:49] <tariqali> And I don’t know why.
[03:05:18] <tariqali> Okay, I found the solution. My combobox was placing “display:none;” on the select box to ensure that users can’t see the select box and only interact with the combobox. jQuery Valdiation does not validate any field that has “display: none;”. This answer (http://stackoverflow.com/a/12308596/4765379) helped me to turn that behavior off.
[06:07:39] <Al_nz1> how do you select the live search box in this fiddle : https://jsfiddle.net/KyleMit/9abm0hhy/
[06:15:05] <Kartagis> doesn't $(".selectpicker") work?
[06:16:01] <Kartagis> oh, $("select").data("live-search")
[06:16:11] <Kartagis> Al_nz1: ^^
[08:21:52] <walidvb> what's the best and most plug-and-play cycle/slideshow plugin atm? need very basic use(responsive, dots for pager, that's about it)
[09:14:28] <dataQuestions> https://jsfiddle.net/3ry2tdb5/ - How do I remove the space in arr[1]?
[09:18:44] <Cork> dataQuestions: split(': ') ?
[09:19:14] <MikeD_> arr[1].replace(/\s/g,'')
[09:19:19] <Cork> no need
[09:19:40] <MikeD_> no need is also true
[09:20:24] <Cork> dataQuestions: also note .children() will only find direct children
[09:20:36] <Cork> not deep nested children as your region
[09:20:38] <MikeD_> ... at least from what we can see - you can certainly have data-region value with space in it - but your later use case may have some reason to not
[09:20:41] <Cork> you want .find for that
[09:21:12] <Cork> dataQuestions: https://jsfiddle.net/3ry2tdb5/2/
[09:21:41] <MikeD_> that doesn't remove the space in "Wine Name"
[09:21:54] <Cork> he didn't ask for that
[09:22:15] <Cork> the old solution left a leading space infront of all names
[09:22:22] <Cork> i suspect that is what the problem was
[09:22:29] <MikeD_> oh, i misread - nm
[10:18:33] <MikeD_> anyone else find the pull request review on bitbucket to be more painful than it should be?
[10:19:20] <dataQuestions> Cork oops, yea I updated to find before I submitted that I assume, but yea, you're correct, just the space in front of the region, which I didn't think it was that easy haha
[10:20:54] <Cork> MikeD_: can't say i've ever used bitbucket
[10:21:15] <Cork> i think i've pulled source from there once, but that's about it
[10:22:09] <dataQuestions> MikeD_ it is
[10:22:15] <dataQuestions> thats why we just moved to github
[10:22:31] <MikeD_> and you're liking it?
[10:23:05] <Cork> github is fairly straight forward ya
[10:23:19] <dataQuestions> i prefer github, cause ^
[10:23:29] <Cork> it is a bit too simplistic for big projects, but it works well for smaller things
[10:24:09] <Cork> (i know of a few big projects that has had to move there issue tracking from github cause it wasn't enough)
[10:25:05] <dataQuestions> Yea, I've seen bigger projects utilize bit cause of jira
[10:25:58] <dataQuestions> trying to remember if bit was the one that used svn over git for a while
[10:26:48] <Cork> one of the bigger ones i know of is servo moving from issue handling on github to bugzilla cause they couldn't track reviews on github
[11:23:36] <FeersumEndjinn> Hey all - I'm having a problem clearing values from a select multiple element in a form - https://dpaste.de/uD7Q#L23,24,25,26.  The 4 highlighted rows are the selected items.  My clear form button clears everything except multiple select fields?  My jQuery is: https://dpaste.de/XO0W
[11:24:05] <FeersumEndjinn> Trying $('#my_id').val(''); doesn't work.
[12:00:54] <panovia> FeersumEndjinn: Not sure how the <a> are related to the select, but try $("#id_company_health_rating").val([]); to unselect all selected items
[12:01:28] <FeersumEndjinn> panovia It turns out the framework I am using (semantic-ui.com) works a little strangely with selects
[14:05:50] <GoSox> Is there a way to do a search-as-you-type input field, with a keystroke delay? In other words, instead of making an http request for every keystroke as you type, it would i guess wait for half a second of inactivity, or something along those lines, before making the request?
[14:06:10] <robertmaxrees> yeah - throttle or debounce
[14:07:40] <robertmaxrees> GoSox ^
[14:30:52] <hlve> Is my syntax with this fine?
[14:30:52] <hlve> $.subscribe('eventA eventB', function() {
[14:30:58] <hlve> If I want to subscribe to multiple events?
[14:31:22] <robertmaxrees> which library are you uising to support thjat?
[14:32:25] <hlve> robertmaxrees, equivalent to .bind
[14:32:30] <robertmaxrees> hlve errr.
[14:32:43] <robertmaxrees> there's no $.subscribe in jquery.
[14:32:54] <hlve> right. there's a .bind though.
[14:33:14] <hlve> let me rephrase that question than ;P
[14:37:08] <hlve> @ robertmaxrees  https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-tiny-pubsub
[14:37:27] <hlve> that's basically what we're using.
[14:37:48] <robertmaxrees> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cowboy/jquery-tiny-pubsub/master/src/tiny-pubsub.js
[14:38:20] <robertmaxrees> should be easy enough to read and understand.  super quick to test, too.
[14:40:39] <Ali_nz1> Kartagis: just got back
[14:40:48] <Ali_nz1> Kartagis: doesnt work?
[14:41:47] <Ali_nz1> how do you select the live search box in this fiddle : https://jsfiddle.net/KyleMit/9abm0hhy/ <- i need to select the text search area at the top of the dropdown
[14:42:04] <robertmaxrees> why?
[14:43:00] <Ali_nz1> robertmaxrees: unless there is a better bootstrap control where I can type in 3 characters then send off some data to ajax to get a set items back to populate a dropdown
[14:43:45] <Ali_nz1> I have 4000 items on my list - too much to send to client until user has typed in a few characters
[14:49:48] <robertmaxrees> Ali_nz1 http://stackoverflow.com/a/26267964/923919
[14:49:54] <robertmaxrees> this q/a should answer your questions.
[14:54:06] <Ali_nz1> robertmaxrees: hasnt he got two drop downs
[14:54:12] <Ali_nz1> or am I missing your point?
[14:54:19] <robertmaxrees> Missing my point :)
[14:55:55] <Ali_nz1> whats the point then?
[14:57:53] <Ali_nz1> bbs - kids need foor

[17:06:28] <Ice_Strike> Any idea why it does not remove hidden class?
[17:06:37] <Ice_Strike> <div id="card-errors" class="bg-danger hidden"></div>
[17:06:49] <Ice_Strike> $('#card-errors').removeClass('hidden');
[17:06:54] <Ice_Strike> $('#card-errors').html(result.error.message);
[17:20:23] <Violinist> umm
[17:20:43] <Violinist> is there a way to hide show element via 0/1 yes
[17:20:58] <Violinist> like true false or something
[17:21:23] <Violinist> if else show hide is pretty lame looking
[18:07:01] <shoky> Violinist: .toggle()
[18:08:04] <Violinist> yeah toggle what
[18:08:15] <Violinist> toggle(value)?
[18:09:01] <shoky> check the docs?
[18:09:19] <Violinist> no u
[18:09:33] <shoky> o
[18:10:33] <Violinist> do u know flot charts
[18:14:28] <IndFaBo> Im trying to append empty spans inside a div but this is appending it once here a example https://jsfiddle.net/q99k1d9o/
[18:16:03] <shoky> IndFaBo: you keep appending the same element - you need to clone it first and append the clone
[18:16:48] <IndFaBo> shoky: can you fiddle a example ?
[18:17:03] <shoky> IndFaBo: .append(emptySpan.clone())
[18:17:29] <IndFaBo> shoky: so easy omg !
[18:17:36] <shoky> :p
[20:07:04] <BigCheese_> I've been using version 1.11.3 but changed to 3.... when I do that POST doesn't work. Is their documentation somewhere that lists changes from one version to another?

[20:17:52] <halfcab123> halp
[20:18:01] <robertmaxrees> sup
[20:18:36] <halfcab123> well.. I'm sending json from express back to my ajax request and i can't get it, to stop being undefined
[20:18:45] <halfcab123> but I can see on the server the json object is formed fine
[20:19:16] <robertmaxrees> what's your frontend code?  mind pasting that to jsfiddle or something?
[20:21:14] <halfcab123> https://pastebin.com/FFNCtckS
[20:21:46] <robertmaxrees> any console errors?
[20:22:05] <robertmaxrees> if not, try a console.log(data) as the first line in that done handler - what do you get?
[20:26:38] <robertmaxrees> any luck halfcab123
[20:29:25] <halfcab123> localhost:3001 says: undefined
[20:29:50] <robertmaxrees> what about your network tab?
[20:30:01] <robertmaxrees> have you looked at the request there?
[20:31:58] <halfcab123> Here's what the json looks like that's being sent
[20:31:58] <halfcab123> https://pastebin.com/Aic5YsPJ
[20:32:09] <halfcab123> I'll check the network tab
[20:32:35] <BigCheese_> robertmax_ exactly what I needed. THX.
[20:32:53] <robertmaxrees> sure BigCheese_
[20:35:32] <halfcab123> Not sure what to look for in network tab everything looks ok
[20:35:39] <robertmaxrees> the specific request.
[20:35:54] <robertmaxrees> open it up, filter to XHR requests, fire the specific one you care about.
[20:36:05] <robertmaxrees> click on it, click the response tab in the box that opens up.
[20:36:08] <shoky> halfcab123: dataType: 'json' means jquery already does JSON.parse for you.  you should be getting a parse error
[20:36:35] <robertmaxrees> shoky he said he's getting undefined with console.log(data) as the first line in that .done() handler.
[20:36:45] <halfcab123> actually
[20:36:51] <shoky> he said "localhost:3001 says: undefined"  which looks like an alert
[20:36:52] <halfcab123> console.log(data) returns the json string
[20:37:01] <robertmaxrees> >.>
[20:37:07] <shoky> halfcab123: it's already a parsed object, not a string
[20:37:11] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[20:37:31] <halfcab123> But then... how do i get it to display with handlebars, its not doing anything with it
[20:37:39] <robertmaxrees> it's erroring right now.
[20:37:45] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to parse it first.
[20:37:48] <halfcab123> {{#listings}}
[20:37:50] <robertmaxrees> since it's already parsed.
[20:39:21] <halfcab123> XHR status 200
[20:39:44] <halfcab123> So I'm just trying to iterate over a template to fill the template out
[20:40:43] <halfcab123> https://pastebin.com/8Q4YgzPi
[20:40:52] <halfcab123> ^ With this implementation, I get no errors
[20:40:57] <halfcab123> But I also get nothing displayed
[20:41:55] <halfcab123> I lost all my friends in an instant
[20:43:31] <halfcab123> Anyone want to help a mustache noob?
[20:46:49] <shoky> halfcab123: except for those  `this.`, and using deprecated/removed .to_html() i don't see anything wrong
[20:47:44] <zampa> So im playing around with jquery tabs.. is there anyway i can have a spefic tab loaded id (specified) every time i visit a page?
[20:47:50] <halfcab123> add this. ?
[20:48:34] <shoky> halfcab123: hm? i mean like in this.title  in your template
[20:49:18] <halfcab123> ah I see
[20:49:31] <halfcab123> what do i use instead of .to_html() ?
[20:49:56] <shoky> halfcab123: .render()..  to_html isn't even in the docs?
[20:50:28] <halfcab123> ohhhh
[20:50:43] <halfcab123> wouldn't it throw an error if it wasn't recognized
[20:51:18] <shoky> halfcab123: it's deprecated i guess. but anyway your rendering code does work fine:  http://jsfiddle.net/qc86uyzx/
[20:52:15] <halfcab123> wow
[20:52:49] <shoky> halfcab123: and works even better if you remove those  `this.` :p
[20:53:38] <halfcab123> So weird
[20:53:47] <halfcab123> Still doesn't work for me :(
[20:54:13] <shoky> log what mustache returns
[20:56:07] <halfcab123> ahh.. I think I'm onto something
[20:56:20] <halfcab123> On your JSfiddle, at the bottom I put, alert(data);
[20:56:24] <zampa> $( "#tabs" ).tabs({active:selected}); <- im currently using that to pre select a tab.. it sort of works.. (the contect is correct, but the actual "tab menu" is hilighting the wrong one.
[20:56:25] <halfcab123> and it shows object object
[20:56:45] <halfcab123> But on my end when i do it, I get the full json string
[20:57:09] <halfcab123> So then that means it's 'not' parsed already right ?
[21:02:07] <halfcab123> shoky: here's the backend code -> https://pastebin.com/8apzW4t5
[21:02:33] <halfcab123> using express router, showing the get and post routes
[21:05:59] <shoky> halfcab123: if you have dataType: 'json' then it shouldbe parsed already..
[21:07:36] <shoky> halfcab123: heh, res.json already stringifies :P
[21:08:12] <halfcab123> ohhh
[21:08:17] <halfcab123> so am I double stringifying ?
[21:08:24] <halfcab123> Is that a problem ?
[21:08:25] <shoky> i guess
[21:08:40] <shoky> yep. but then the double parse should have worked too, heh
[21:11:50] <zampa> Why dont i understand theese tabs..
[21:12:25] <halfcab123> Zampa, I feel your pain, json hates me
[21:12:39] <zampa> I'm in way wirth everything frontendrelated .P
[21:13:04] <zampa> I have literally gone through first 3 pages on googles for 3 different search terms. nothing seems to work and i really think im missing something obvious.
[21:15:08] <zampa> $( "#tabs" ).tabs({ active: 4 }); <-- they keep claiming thats what you should do. and to some extent they are correct, it loads the correct tab, no tab gets hilighted though.
[21:16:40] <halfcab123> I tried alert(data + ' ' + data[0] + ' ' + data.listings + ' ' + data.listings[0] + ' ' + data.listings.title);
[21:16:47] <halfcab123> And got either object object or undefined
[21:17:22] <halfcab123> how can I simply alert one of the values of the data shoky ?
[21:17:55] <halfcab123> Do I need to convert this into an array or something
[21:17:55] <shoky> halfcab123: you should never alert anything, you should console.log.   e.g.  console.log(data, data.listings)
[21:18:11] <shoky> and don't concatenate objects with +
[21:18:18] <zampa> ^
[21:18:29] <zampa> never ever try to printou to objects with +
[21:18:58] <shoky> zampa: i remember that tabs option working fine, must be something else going on. make a jsfiddle
[21:20:17] <halfcab123> Ok I got this - http://imgur.com/a/9ibhD
[21:20:32] <halfcab123> Maybe now you can tell me what is wrong here
[21:20:48] <shoky> halfcab123: looks fine :p
[21:21:18] <halfcab123> how would I output the description to console.log ?
[21:21:37] <shoky> data.listings[0].description
[21:24:00] <halfcab123> am I supposed to use the {{#each listings}} clause like that ?
[21:24:34] <zampa> In the fiddle it works...
[21:24:48] <zampa> Guess i cant fully mimic the way i do it in my code. :/
[21:25:31] <zampa> I load in the entire page in via ajax...
[21:25:33] <zampa> perhaps thats why?
[21:25:40] <zampa> https://gist.github.com/zampa86/1af3c1ff92810133763230385957fac7
[21:26:05] <zampa> i first load in the entire tab page (with ajax) then i load in the specific tab with ajax.
[21:27:07] <shoky> you seem to be initializing the tabs before inserting the html?
[21:27:29] <shoky> doesn't make sense to use the document ready handler like that there
[21:27:51] <zampa> im sort of very new to front end scripting.
[21:27:56] <zampa> I just follow random guides :d
[21:28:39] <zampa> the thing is. it loads the correct tab.
[21:28:45] <zampa> Its just not displaying the active class properly on it.
[21:28:50] <halfcab123> Can I pay someone to remote in and help me ? lol
[21:29:07] <halfcab123> I feel like if I can figure this one problem out, I'll be set from here
[21:29:33] <shoky> good luck, and good night ;p
[22:01:52] <zampa> I really dont get theese tabs thing.. no tab ever becomes hilighted even though it loads in the correct tab..
[22:47:23] <nopacien13> HI
[22:48:00] <nopacien13> long time jquery user here ... started looking in react, angular
[22:48:52] <nopacien13> havent learnt them completely yet.. however i prefer jquery
[22:49:12] <nopacien13> but i liked that angular and react allows html inside the js
[22:49:34] <nopacien13> is there some recomended combo for jquery+es6+html in js
[22:57:21] <nopacien13> nvm
