[09:27:36] <Sircle> a js question:
[09:27:40] <Sircle> I have a handleChange(e){} but now I want to have handleChange(e,param1, param2){}. How can I call this handlechange when I do not have e?
[09:44:19] <pavonia> Sircle: You usually use the e.data object for passing extra parameters along
[15:33:09] <PhpNoob> hi
[15:33:16] <PhpNoob> http://jsfiddle.net/dXmsD/51/ i have this
[15:33:42] <PhpNoob> when i select opt3 opt1 opt2 its write 1,2,3 but i want to write it in field 3,1,2
[15:33:59] <PhpNoob> how can i solve it?
[15:37:26] <PhpNoob> any idea*
[15:41:54] <pavonia> PhpNoob: What do you mean?
[15:42:58] <PhpNoob> try http://jsfiddle.net/dXmsD/51/
[15:43:28] <PhpNoob> pavonia when i select first opt3 after op2 and opt1 (multiple) this id write on field like 1,2,3
[15:43:43] <PhpNoob> but i want it write my select option id. like 3,2,1
[15:43:52] <PhpNoob> or what i select first and after that...
[15:44:51] <notchris> Iâ€™m trying to use $.extend to merge two objects
[15:45:12] <pavonia> PhpNoob: Selects don't have an order, AFAIK, so you would have to store the old value and compare it to the new one on chang to determine which item was added
[15:45:23] <notchris> If data contains two objects, what should I expect from using extend on data[0] and data[1]
[15:45:46] <notchris> Because I then reference data[0] and it is still the original object
[15:46:37] <notchris> Im thinking this may be wrong? data = $.extend(data[0],data[1]);
[15:47:21] <PhpNoob> pavonia its sorting problem i think ?
[15:47:38] <PhpNoob> pavonia its not sort my select order.
[15:47:51] <PhpNoob> pavonia i dont know how to solve it.
[15:48:16] <notchris> yeah $.extend is not combining objects
[15:48:29] <pavonia> PhpNoob: It doesn't store your selection order anywhere, you have to store it yourself if you need it
[15:48:39] <pavonia> PhpNoob: Why is the order even important?
[15:50:00] <PhpNoob> because i select in dropdown menu its category
[15:50:10] <PhpNoob> and after than i recorded it to mysql
[15:50:47] <pavonia> Category of what?
[15:50:59] <PhpNoob> its just category
[15:51:01] <PhpNoob> like food
[15:51:42] <krambiorix> hi, can i combine in one webapplication jquery mobile and normal jquery?
[15:52:36] <pavonia> PhpNoob: I don't understand what one thing has to to with the other
[15:53:37] <PhpNoob> it doesnt matter what category is
[15:53:47] <PhpNoob> i just need sort it with my select order. can i do it?
[15:54:26] <pavonia> Sorry, I don't know what you mean. The values already *are* sorted
[15:54:45] <PhpNoob> value is sorted buy id
[15:54:50] <PhpNoob> by *
[15:55:10] <PhpNoob> i dont want its sorted by id. i want it sort by my select.
[15:56:40] <PhpNoob> its always order like 1,2,3
[15:56:48] <PhpNoob> doesnt matter what you select first second third.
[15:57:10] <pavonia> Because it doesn't care in what order you select things
[15:57:45] <pavonia> As I said, you have to store the intermediate selection results and determine the order from them
[15:58:31] <PhpNoob> is there any example for it?
[16:06:44] <PhpNoob> pavonia any example
[16:07:04] <pavonia> I don't have one
[16:07:50] <PhpNoob> what i write in google to search it?
[16:42:17] <xebra> I'm overwhelmed by countless possible choices as usual. I'd need a datetime picker, so that the input field will be in a database-ready format (datetime, 2017-05-28 12:00:00)
[16:42:37] <xebra> apparently jQueryUI only has a date picker, not datetime
[17:58:49] <Spomzper> Hello i am new with Jquery
