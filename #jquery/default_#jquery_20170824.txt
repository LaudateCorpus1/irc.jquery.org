[07:29:31] <kiwi_67342> hi all i'm writing an extension and I want to write on at a specific place
[07:30:14] <kiwi_67342> meaning I want user to choose in which place (x;y) he want the input to be written
[07:52:37] <pavonia> kiwi_67342: What do you mean?
[08:03:46] <Cork> kiwi_67342: are you talking about absolute positioning elements?
[08:15:02] <kiwi_67342> Cork: yes
[08:15:15] <kiwi_67342> pavonia: I mean simulate a click at a specific position
[08:16:59] <Cork> kiwi_67342: you could bind a click handle on body and then use event.pageX event.pageY and absolute position the element
[08:17:28] <Cork> the question is a bit too abstract to give a definitive answer though
[08:19:56] <kiwi_67342> i'll try to explain better, I want to create an extension that auth user in facebook automatically
[08:20:04] <kiwi_67342> for that user need to store email and password
[08:20:11] <kiwi_67342> in js var
[08:20:35] <kiwi_67342> and after that a clic is simulated on email field and password field
[08:25:49] <kiwi_67342> ok i found it : HTMLElement.click()
[08:29:09] <ksm101> kiwi_67342: Tought you asked for something like this xD -> https://jsfiddle.net/ksm101/jmps3fux/
[08:29:52] <kiwi_67342> no^^
[08:30:41] <ksm101> "I want user to choose in which place (x;y) he want the input to be written " ... well... I guessed it wrong :P
[08:31:04] <kiwi_67342> ksm101: yeah I explained wrong xD
[08:31:47] <ksm101> :D
[08:36:15] <kiwi_67342> strange it doesn't work https://pastebin.com/R4dynqDH
[08:37:12] <Cork> kiwi_67342: don't use event attributes
[08:37:25] <Cork> use addEventListener() if you want to use pure js
[08:37:37] <kiwi_67342> ah ok i'll try
[08:39:51] <Cork> wait... you want to trigger click on the input field as soon as someone mouse over the input field??
[08:40:24] <IamTrying> Using jQuery. And given choice to use 1) AngularJS or 2) ReactJS & Typescript. Which one should jQuery experts pick?
[08:40:55] <kiwi_67342> Cork: yeah but i'm just trying after that i'll change it with onload event
[08:52:03] <Cork> kiwi_67342: is .focus what you're trying to do?
[08:53:24] <kiwi_67342> no^^
[08:53:38] <Cork> then what is the point of clicking the input field?
[08:54:23] <kiwi_67342> facebook login form
[08:54:41] <Cork> kiwi_67342: it isn't sure you can fake thaty
[08:54:43] <Cork> *that
[08:54:53] <Cork> cause you can't fake a user clicking on elements
[08:55:16] <Cork> you can emulate click events, but if the script checks for it you can't get around it
[08:55:39] <kiwi_67342> it doesn't check^^
[08:58:12] <kiwi_67342> https://pastebin.com/CgZFt4My  like event it doesn't work :s
[08:58:30] <Cork> remove the on
[08:59:52] <kiwi_67342> it's better but : Uncaught ReferenceError: getElementById is not defined
[08:59:53] <kiwi_67342>     at HTMLInputElement.<anonymous> (file.html:23)
[09:00:08] <pavonia> Cork: What's the difference between faking clicks and emulating click events?
[09:00:21] <Cork> pavonia: none
[09:00:38] <Cork> its just that they aren't the same as a user clicking the element for real
[09:01:30] <pavonia> But how can your differentiate between both programatically?
[09:03:57] <Cork> pavonia: https://jsfiddle.net/h5n5z9t8/
[09:05:25] <Cork> pavonia: on native dom event objects isTrusted is only true if the event came from a user action
[09:05:48] <Cork> (it is what links check to see if the default action should be allowed to navigate the page)
[09:06:39] <pavonia> Cool, thanks
[09:40:48] <cp2> hey guys, can some one tell me why when i put dont-save class on an input it still fires the change event https://jsfiddle.net/djsLu3j9/
[09:41:51] <Cork> cp2: selectors aren't dynamic
[09:42:24] <Cork> cp2: so the class is checked for when the page loads and then nothing after that (so the last input won't ever work for example)
[09:43:04] <Cork> cp2: https://jsfiddle.net/djsLu3j9/1/
[09:43:29] <Cork> and actually no
[09:43:40] <Cork> cause you run .not() on cf not the input fields
[09:43:48] <Cork> so it won't ever filter anything
[09:44:35] <cp2> Cork: thanks!
[10:57:38] <hellyeah> i keep object inside value
[10:57:57] <hellyeah> can i replace this object to another page by using value?
[10:59:07] <taplar> have to give us more info to go on than that man
[10:59:57] <hellyeah> sure
[11:00:11] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/32/ check 89-96
[11:00:18] <hellyeah> i keep object inside value
[11:00:30] <hellyeah> this is the screenshot
[11:00:45] <hellyeah> i need to send this screenshot with email
[11:01:10] <hellyeah> you understand?
[11:01:25] <taplar> i assume you want > 0 on line 90
[11:02:23] <hellyeah> i just want to store one variable at a time
[11:02:31] <hellyeah> ah
[11:02:37] <hellyeah> yeah thats right
[11:03:08] <hellyeah> actually no
[11:03:09] <hellyeah> :d
[11:03:21] <kiwi_67342> any idea why this doesn't work ? https://pastebin.com/K4YBJ6Xe
[11:03:23] <hellyeah> === 0 is fine :D
[11:03:27] <taplar> if there is not a canvas to be found, the inner logic makes no sense
[11:03:41] <hellyeah> there will be
[11:03:50] <taplar> no dude
[11:03:54] <hellyeah> takeScreensshot method always produce canvas
[11:03:57] <taplar> if length === 0, line 92 will not find anything
[11:04:55] <hellyeah> yea
[11:05:15] <blackorzar> Hello, is the re a jquery framework (like jqueryui) to create jquery components with a structure similar to webcomponents?
[11:05:23] <hellyeah> sec
[11:05:28] <hellyeah> i am stupid as fuck
[11:05:35] <taplar> kiwi_67342: are you getting any console errors?
[11:06:24] <kiwi_67342> taplar: nothing
[11:06:32] <hellyeah> taplar:  https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/33/
[11:08:09] <taplar> hellyeah: ok?  what's the issue now?  i have to double click it to see it in the console, but i am seeing the found canvas
[11:08:43] <hellyeah> i need to send this canvas with email to someone
[11:08:51] <kiwi_67342> all is working except the click event
[11:08:56] <hellyeah> if it is possible
[11:09:09] <taplar> kiwi_67342: if you put a log in the click handler, the part doing the window.open, do you see it log?
[11:09:13] <kiwi_67342> I passed the mouse over input and nothing worked
[11:09:53] <taplar> kiwi_67342:  actually this is all vanilla js.  you should ask in ##javascript
[11:10:29] <hellyeah> you should use jsfiddle also
[11:10:31] <kiwi_67342> yes taplar
[11:11:08] <taplar> hellyeah: i'm not familiar with how you'd send a canvas element to a server to be emailed.
[11:11:32] <hellyeah> without sending server anyway hmm
[11:11:43] <hellyeah> okey thanks taplar
[11:11:52] <taplar> you'd want to send it to the server for the email
[11:12:04] <taplar> javascript doesn't do emails
[11:12:09] <taplar> and shouldn't do emails
[11:13:32] <kiwi_67342> xmlhttprequest
[11:13:37] <kiwi_67342> can do it
[11:13:46] <taplar> that's an ajax request
[11:13:53] <taplar> which would go to a server, which would do the email
[11:15:14] <taplar> there we go
[11:15:14] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/rvgatgns/34/
[11:15:41] <taplar> you can use toDataURL() on a canvas element to get the base64 encoding that you can send to the server that can then be included in the email
[11:16:31] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL for documentation
[11:16:33] <taplar> brb
[11:18:54] <taplar> b
[11:19:11] <hellyeah> thanks taplar
[11:36:05] <Hoder> Hey guys, what would be causing this api to return 'undefined' when I try to use 'jt' for jobtype? https://jsfiddle.net/padogt5m/1/
[11:39:09] <taplar> Hoder: looks like you are only passing in at most 5 of the parameters to that method
[11:41:42] <jak2000> hi all
[11:43:30] <jak2000> how toconvert this string to: myDate1="2017/8/16";   --->   "2017/08/16" i try use moment but convert this: wauxFecha=moment("2017/8/16").format('YYYY/MM/DD');  was converted to: "2017/08/01"   any advice how to fix it?
[11:44:56] <taplar> ##javascript
[11:45:34] <Hoder> taplar: how would that stop jobtype from actually be scraped though?
[11:45:53] <jak2000> taplar... any advice?
[11:46:12] <taplar> Hoder: call your methods correctly and then see what issues you have
[11:46:20] <jak2000> leftpad?
[11:46:22] <taplar> jak2000: yeah, go ask javascript since that is not a jquery question
[11:47:57] <Hoder> are you talking at my jobSearch() method?
[11:48:41] <Hoder> I think i pass all of the params I need, correct? or am I missing some?
[11:49:16] <taplar> you are passing 5/6
[11:49:40] <taplar> jobSearch($('#locale').val(), $('#job').val(),country,0,limit,);
[11:49:48] <taplar> jobSearch($('#locale').val(), $('#job').val(), country, start, end);
[11:50:07] <taplar> from the two instances i found in the code
[11:53:38] <Hoder> so I'd need to pass it like this: jobSearch($('#locale').val(), $('#job').val(), country, jobtype, start, end);
[12:03:49] <taplar> your method is expecting 6 inputs.  give it what it wants, :)
[12:05:04] <Keytap> Hey guys, weird question.  I've got an anchor being wrapped by a div, and I have a click event handler registered on both, however I can only modify the handler on the anchor element.
[12:05:59] <robertmaxrees> Keytap okay - so what's the question?
[12:06:01] <Keytap> My question is this, if, in the handler for the anchor element, I call stopPropagation on the event object, under what circumstances would the div's handler still be called?
[12:06:15] <Keytap> lol
[12:06:24] <robertmaxrees> it won't.,
[12:06:28] <Keytap> it is.  :P
[12:06:39] <taplar> unless there is some padding or something around the 'a' that they can click
[12:06:41] <Keytap> Like, I can view it in the chrome debugger.
[12:06:51] <Keytap> The first target that gets called is the anchor's handelr
[12:07:06] <Keytap> I call stopPropagation, but it bubbles right on up to the div
[12:07:07] <taplar> make a fiddle that replicates the issue
[12:07:12] <Keytap> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[12:07:22] <Keytap> I'll see what I can do.  Give me a sec
[12:07:23] <Hoder> ;_;    I'm trying to, but i don't have 6 inputs
[12:07:38] <robertmaxrees> Keytap https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ghce2d2f/
[12:07:39] <Keytap> taplar: Will codepen work?
[12:07:52] <taplar> so long as it is runnable, idk
[12:07:58] <taplar> idc
[12:08:21] <Keytap> Hrm...  Mines set up slightly different
[12:08:32] <robertmaxrees> sooooo what's different?
[12:08:37] <Keytap> Since I links can be added on the fly, I've got it set up as a delegate handler
[12:09:11] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ghce2d2f/1/
[12:09:14] <robertmaxrees> same result.
[12:09:24] <Keytap> Huh...
[12:09:38] <Keytap> Maybe it has to do with the jQuery version?  I'm running 1.10 (legacy app)
[12:10:40] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ghce2d2f/2/
[12:10:47] <robertmaxrees> using https://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.min.js
[12:10:54] <Hoder> taplar: seems like it still is coming undefined
[12:10:57] <Hoder> https://jsfiddle.net/padogt5m/4/
[12:11:04] <Keytap> That's exactly the version we're using.
[12:11:15] <Keytap> bizaar
[12:11:20] <Keytap> bizare?
[12:11:26] <Keytap> Well, however you spell it.
[12:11:37] <Keytap> I mean, it's not like I'm doing anything tricky here.
[12:11:38] <robertmaxrees> bizarre :)
[12:11:44] <Keytap> That's the one
[12:12:55] <Keytap> Aha!
[12:13:00] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:13:11] <Keytap> https://jsfiddle.net/ghce2d2f/3/
[12:13:24] <Keytap> Apologies if I just modified your fiddle.  I assumed it would spawn a new anonymous one.
[12:13:41] <robertmaxrees> doesn't matter.
[12:13:50] <Keytap> But yeah, that replicates the issue
[12:13:52] <robertmaxrees> it revises them - the /3/ is a different version :)
[12:14:00] <robertmaxrees> so then exactly the reverse of what you were talking about heh.
[12:14:02] <Keytap> I was being a bit disengenuous in my example, sorry
[12:14:26] <Keytap> Didn't think that it would matter that the delegate is being called from the parent
[12:14:44] <Keytap> Apparently it does.  So is it being called on the capture or bubble phase?
[12:14:49] <robertmaxrees> bubble.
[12:15:19] <Keytap> If it was being caught on the bubble phase, I would assume the delegate handler (on the anchor) would be called after the li's
[12:15:22] <robertmaxrees> so which of the two handlers here do you have control over?
[12:15:28] <Keytap> The anchor's
[12:15:37] <Keytap> I mean, could make it a non-delegate
[12:15:59] <Keytap> But that adds a little more work (#lazinessftw) and another point of failure
[12:16:15] <Keytap> Though for the short term, I may not have another option
[12:16:31] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i'd ask whou you need both handlers at that point.
[12:17:10] <Keytap> It's for a menu.  If the user clicks the actual link itself, I just want the link to be activated.  But if they click the container, it should expand (if it the menu item has children)
[12:17:32] <Keytap> The li is where the click to expand the children happens
[12:18:34] <robertmaxrees> hrm..
[12:18:40] <Keytap> That indeed did do the trick
[12:18:48] <Keytap> (changing the handler to a non-delegate handler)
[12:19:01] <robertmaxrees> funky.  that shouldn't worked anyway.  wonder why it didn't.
[12:19:10] <robertmaxrees> *should've
[12:19:15] <Keytap> Dunno.  A bug, you think?
[12:19:18] <poboy> wazzzzzuuuuuup
[12:19:22] <Keytap> Howdy
[12:19:37] <robertmaxrees> i doubt it.
[12:20:06] <Keytap> C'est la vie.
[12:20:22] <Keytap> Will just have to make sure to remember to add the handler when we add links to the menu
[12:24:11] <hellyeah> C'est la vie
[12:24:21] <hellyeah> i have known meaning of that
[12:24:23] <hellyeah> i forgot
[12:24:42] <hellyeah> can you tell me Keytap por favor?
[12:25:31] <Keytap> Such is life
[12:25:46] <Keytap> ^hellyeah
[12:26:09] <hellyeah> right
[12:26:14] <hellyeah> thanks
[12:26:19] <Keytap> Cheers
[13:03:18] <taplar> wow
[13:04:02] <robertmaxrees> yes, own wilson?
[13:04:04] <robertmaxrees> *owen
[13:04:13] <taplar> lol
[13:04:20] <taplar> nyce
[13:04:50] <taplar> oh i was just looking back at Holders last link.  he fixed the call to pass in the 6 arguments, but then he had taken the field in question out of the function definition parameter list
[13:05:18] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[13:05:20] <robertmaxrees> well alright.
[13:07:05] <plamb> does it make sense that binding a .toggle to a type='radio' would also apply default css styles to it?
[13:07:26] <taplar> elaborate?
[13:08:13] <plamb> for some reason when i change $(...).click(....) to $(....).toggle(....) the element gets like 10 css styles applied to it
[13:08:33] <taplar> well click(function) ?
[13:08:37] <plamb> well more like 6 but yeah
[13:08:40] <plamb> yes
[13:08:42] <jak2000> robertmaxrees! taplar!
[13:08:45] <taplar> that's creating a binding
[13:08:46] <plamb> im using .show() and .hide()
[13:08:48] <plamb> is that why?
[13:08:59] <taplar> toggle() is adding/removing classes or the display property
[13:09:30] <plamb> oh whoops
[13:09:36] <plamb> i was thinking incorrectly about .toggle
[13:10:31] <taplar> jak2000: sup
[13:16:06] <Hoder> hey taplar, is this closer to what I need? I still can't seem to get it to include it as a response :/  https://jsfiddle.net/padogt5m/13/
[13:21:22] <taplar> jobSearch(locale, data, country, jobtype, start, end)
[13:21:33] <taplar> jobSearch($('#locale').val(), $('#job').val(), jobtype, country,0,limit);
[13:21:37] <taplar> see a problem?
[13:22:03] <Hoder> not including data in the second one?
[13:22:22] <taplar> look at the fields that you are passing in, in order, from start to finish
[13:22:49] <taplar> start to finish being left to right
[13:23:12] <Hoder> location, data, country, jobtype, start and end?
[13:23:27] <taplar> and look at what you are actually passing in
[13:24:12] <Hoder> which one is that, the 2nd one?
[13:24:21] <taplar> yes
[13:25:03] <Hoder> I'm passing the value of the locale input, value of the job input, jobtype, country and limit?
[13:25:26] <Keytap> I prefer lop and rop for my operand names, personally.  Mainly because they're fun to say.
[13:25:48] <Keytap> whoops.  Ignore that.
[13:25:50] <taplar> Hoder: you only mentioned 5 inputs
[13:26:00] <taplar> seriously compare the two
[13:26:26] <Hoder> I'm missing data?
[13:26:32] <taplar> are you?
[13:26:48] <Hoder> I don't know any more haha. I think so
[13:26:53] <taplar> you should be able to look at a function definition to see what it is expecting, and look at a call to it that you are making and know what you are giving it
[13:27:38] <taplar> i even pasted them each one after another.  you can easily look at the variables in each position to compare them
[13:28:50] <Hoder> I'm missing the #job.val
[13:29:01] <taplar> no
[13:29:12] <taplar> it's expecting 6 things.  you are passing in 6 things
[13:29:16] <taplar> but there is an issue with that
[13:29:40] <Hoder> one is being passed inputs, rather than vars?
[13:29:53] <taplar> huh?
[13:30:08] <Hoder> ones being passed the value of an input, rather than a variable
[13:30:20] <taplar> a variable is just a reference to a value
[13:30:49] <taplar> you're thinking about this too much.  don't make me step by step ask what you are giving for each parameter dude
[13:31:18] <Hoder> the bottom one has limit on it?
[13:31:19] <taplar> look at those two lines, and ask yourself for each parameter, what are you passing in to it
[13:31:40] <taplar> the names don't matter
[13:31:50] <Hoder> ok
[13:31:57] <taplar> parameters on a function do not have to match anything in regards to how they are being called
[13:32:11] <taplar> they just need to be given the relevant data they are expecting to be
[13:33:16] <Hoder> ok, so I'm passing in locale's value, jobs value, jobtype, the value of the jobtype selector, country and limit
[13:33:46] <taplar> and it expects?
[13:34:01] <taplar> wait
[13:34:32] <taplar> " jobs value, jobtype, the value of the jobtype selector"   <-- what?
[13:34:58] <Hoder> jobs is the title, jobtype is the selector
[13:35:20] <Hoder> oh oops, I just repeated my self
[13:35:27] <taplar> yeah
[13:35:55] <Hoder> so I'm getting the value of locale, value of jobs, value of jobtype, country and limit
[13:36:07] <taplar> and the function expects?
[13:36:15] <taplar> you left out one btw
[13:36:27] <taplar> you left out 0
[13:36:28] <Hoder> oh and 0
[13:36:50] <Hoder> function jobSearch(locale, $('#job').val(), data, country, jobtype, start, end){
[13:36:55] <Hoder> thats what it expects?
[13:37:00] <taplar> no
[13:37:21] <taplar> jobSearch(locale, data, country, jobtype, start, end)  <-- is what your function definiton was
[13:38:22] <Hoder> Okay
[13:38:51] <taplar> compare with what you are giving it
[13:39:08] <Hoder> data, locale, jobtype, limit, country, start, end?
[13:39:18] <taplar> so what's the problem?
[13:39:28] <taplar> wait, no
[13:39:29] <taplar> lol
[13:39:30] <taplar> dude
[13:39:46] <taplar> you just said what you are giving it, and then you repeated what you are giving it completely differently
[13:40:00] <hellyeah> yo
[13:40:17] <Hoder> I thought you meant whats in my ajax call
[13:40:24] <taplar> no
[13:40:40] <taplar> we are working on trying to get you to understand why you are calling this method incorrectly
[13:40:53] <Hoder> okay
[13:41:12] <taplar> jobSearch(locale, data, country, jobtype, start, end)
[13:41:19] <taplar> what value are you giving to 'locale' ?
[13:41:42] <Hoder> whatever is typed in that #locale input
[13:41:49] <taplar> no
[13:41:54] <Hoder> oh 10
[13:42:02] <taplar> it's whatever is in the same position in the method call
[13:42:12] <taplar> what is the argument in that same position?
[13:42:58] <taplar> it could be the value of the locale.  is it?
[13:43:35] <Hoder> isn't that what I said ?
[13:43:44] <taplar> so what about 'data'?
[13:44:01] <Hoder> it doesn't match with the value of job?
[13:44:15] <taplar> is that what you are passing in as the second argument?
[13:45:14] <Hoder> in my click function, yes
[13:45:21] <taplar> what about 'country'?
[13:45:40] <Hoder> matches to jobtype
[13:45:49] <taplar> ....
[13:45:49] <Hoder> well, mismatches to jobtype?
[13:46:04] <taplar> soooooo.....
[13:46:13] <Hoder> I need to move them around?
[13:46:23] <taplar> ?
[13:46:56] <Hoder> in my function call?
[13:46:59] <Hoder> reorder them?
[13:47:04] <taplar> why?
[13:47:19] <taplar> what is the problem?
[13:47:28] <Hoder> Country doesn't match to jobtype
[13:47:41] <taplar> why not?
[13:48:01] <Hoder> wait, I'm not passing the value of #job
[13:48:08] <taplar> no you rae
[13:48:11] <taplar> *are
[13:48:16] <taplar> we are on to the issue right now
[13:48:26] <taplar> focus  focus focus
[13:48:43] <taplar> why isn't the value of country correct?
[13:48:50] <Hoder> How am I passing the value of 'job'?
[13:49:24] <taplar> you are passing $('#job').val() in as the second parameter
[13:49:41] <taplar> data will be your job value
[13:49:49] <Hoder> okay, I'm following now
[13:49:51] <taplar> but country is coming in as your jobtype value
[13:50:48] <Hoder> Why is that?
[13:50:54] <taplar> we just said why
[13:51:02] <Hoder> because it doesn't match?
[13:51:12] <taplar> what do you mean 'doesn't match' ?
[13:51:26] <Hoder> jobSearch($('#locale').val(), $('#job').val(), jobtype, country,0,limit);
[13:51:31] <Hoder> 		jobSearch($('#locale').val(), $('#job').val(), country, jobtype, start, end);
[13:51:37] <Hoder> the ordering?
[13:51:38] <taplar> boom
[13:52:02] <taplar> sorta
[13:52:09] <taplar> your mixing your call with your definition
[13:52:12] <Hoder> https://jsfiddle.net/padogt5m/14/
[13:52:17] <taplar> just swap the country to the right position in the call
[13:52:36] <Hoder> I think i did that right?
[13:52:36] <taplar> yay
[13:52:43] <taplar> did you?
[13:52:52] <Hoder> in the above link
[13:52:53] <Hoder> yea
[13:52:55] <taplar> heh, you're asking super basic questions dude , :)
[13:53:29] <Hoder> I'm not a javascript developer, I'm front end mainly. I can do basic js stuff, but never worked with apis ;_;
[13:53:33] <taplar> it expects X, Y, Z.  i'm giving it X, Y, Z.  is that right?  damn straight it is!
[13:53:48] <taplar> this isn't api
[13:53:53] <taplar> this is basic functional logic
[13:54:12] <taplar> you expect parameters, parameters are ordered and will be provided in the order you give them.
[13:54:20] <taplar> there is no ambiguity there
[13:54:35] <Hoder> I didnt know params needed ordered tbh
[13:54:50] <taplar> yes
[13:55:01] <taplar> the names are not associated in any way
[13:55:12] <Hoder> alright
[13:55:42] <Hoder> but I'm still having the issue with undefined jobtype :/
[13:55:44] <taplar> var name = "me";  function test (a, name, b){ console.log('name'); }  test(1, name 2);  test(name, 1, 2)
[13:56:00] <taplar> that will not do the same thing.  the name parameter has no baring on what is passed in
[13:56:46] <taplar> where are you even setting the value of the jobtype variable?
[13:57:15] <taplar> i see the var up top.  i don't see it being set any where
[13:57:26] <Hoder> Well the job type var can be set, but also I just want it to come through with the api response
[13:57:53] <taplar> you are giving the var to the method, to be used on the call
[13:58:01] <taplar> it -has- to be set at some point before that call
[13:58:25] <taplar> same with all of those inputs you are giving it
[13:58:31] <Hoder> oh wait
[13:58:38] <Hoder> i think im misunderstanding the api
[13:58:50] <Hoder> it has jt, but I don't think you print that, only filter by it
[14:00:04] <Hoder> BOOM
[14:00:07] <Hoder> it works
[14:00:48] <taplar> cooleo
[14:01:26] <Hoder> I spent all this time trying to print that jobtype
[14:01:30] <Hoder> thanks so much man
[14:01:37] <Hoder> sorry i'm stupid lol
[14:01:37] <taplar> sure
[14:02:08] <taplar> nah. i just really wanted you to be able to identify the problem yourself, :)
[14:02:40] <Hoder> that shit goes right over my head though lol
[14:06:00] <plamb> jquery dudes, if I want to capture the value a user has left in an input=range elem, you think a best practice is to use a moustout event?
[14:06:08] <plamb> to detect when a user is "done"
[14:06:42] <taplar> does a change event happen before focus is lost?
[14:06:44] <plamb> mouseout*
[14:06:56] <plamb> on a range elem, how is focus defined?
[14:07:06] <plamb> when they release the mouse button?
[14:07:22] <taplar> a range element could be tabbed to and changed with left or right arrows i believe
[14:07:35] <plamb> ah yes it does
[14:07:46] <plamb> so mouseout wouldnt be appropriate
[14:08:03] <taplar> so if a change event happens before focus out, then you could use that
[14:08:26] <plamb> "focus out" would capture someone using arrows or the mouse right?
[14:08:41] <taplar> if you click on something that is tabbable it will gain focus
[14:08:48] <taplar> once you click on something else, it loses focus
[14:08:54] <taplar> 'focus out' or 'blur'
[14:09:53] <plamb> ranges do not get focus events in Safari, unless they are actually focused (tabbed into from a prior <input>)
[14:09:56] <plamb> interesting
[14:09:59] <plamb> wonder if they've changed that
[14:11:30] <taplar> looks like input would work
[14:11:43] <taplar> at least in chrome: https://jsfiddle.net/t9n890yk/
[14:12:00] <taplar> change happens as soon as the mouse is let go
[14:12:09] <plamb> intersting
[14:12:28] <taplar> looks like for the arrow keys, input and change happen each time
[14:13:12] <plamb> now i cant decide the best way to implement this
[14:13:18] <plamb> https://jsfiddle.net/plamb/4sawg130/
[14:13:32] <plamb> basically i want to grab the values "left" in those two ranges and do some calculations
[14:13:52] <plamb> but i probably dont want the calculations to fire every time the slider is moved
[14:13:57] <taplar> left?
[14:14:25] <plamb> i'd say focusout'd but a user may modify them and wait to see what comes back as recommended
[14:14:29] <plamb> without ever focusing out
[14:14:49] <plamb> i almost feel like i should 'change' 'input' with some sort of time lag before the calculations start
[14:15:15] <taplar> you could throttle or debounce it
[14:15:57] <plamb> how likely is it that doing some basic multiplication and sorting on like 15 elements will slow down a page if it gets fired continuously
[14:16:06] <plamb> as the slider is moved
[14:16:23] <taplar> you're talking about an input event for each numerical change
[14:16:30] <plamb> yeah
[14:16:43] <taplar> worst case, they drag one range all the way from left to right
[14:16:57] <plamb> yeah and it fires off the calcuation like 20 times lol
[14:17:32] <taplar> i'd probably debounce it
[14:17:45] <plamb> looking up what that is
[14:18:02] <taplar> you make it wait until a certain about of time has passed until you perform the action
[14:18:19] <taplar> so so long as the user is dragging the range left and right like crazy it won't do anything
[14:18:36] <taplar> but as soon as they stop for... say 500-1000 milliseconds or soemthing, you'd do the calculations
[14:18:45] <plamb> yep that was my thought
[14:18:49] <plamb> seems like the best idea
[14:19:04] <plamb> is $.debounce a default method in jquery?
[14:19:08] <taplar> no
[14:19:12] <plamb> or some additional lib
[14:19:18] <taplar> there is a plugin i believe, or lodash has it in there
[14:19:23] <taplar> or you can write it yourself
[14:19:46] <taplar> at a basic level it's using a setTimeout that you create and clear over and over
[14:20:34] <plamb> looks like a fairly small lib thankfully
[14:22:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/4sawg130/1/
[14:23:57] <plamb> is clearTimeout a default function in jquery?
[14:24:13] <taplar> vanilla
[14:24:34] <plamb> so this is waiting 500ms after an input event
[14:24:46] <plamb> to change the .range-value ?
[14:24:49] <taplar> yep, so long as it is not cleared by another input event
[14:25:00] <plamb> interesting
[14:25:00] <taplar> only the one that survives for 500 ms will fire
[14:25:05] <plamb> nice
[14:26:59] <ploupz> var x = window.open(document.getElementById("url").value);
[14:26:59] <ploupz>  var source_code = x.document.documentElement.innerHTML;
[14:27:13] <ploupz> why this doesn't work
[14:27:45] <ploupz> it only show me <head></head> and <body></body>
[14:28:12] <taplar> ##javascript
[14:28:39] <ploupz> oh sorry people doesn't answer in js :/
[14:44:17] <hellyeah> pls help why i got this error it is on console https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/41/ when i click button second time ajax rrequest is done
[14:45:03] <hellyeah> smt wrong?
[14:46:31] <hellyeah> damn
[14:46:44] <hellyeah> may be
[14:46:58] <hellyeah> no
[14:47:17] <robertmaxrees> what error?
[14:48:01] <taplar> ln 102, canvas isn't defined
[14:48:06] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/43/ error is caught TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined if you click button second time it works
[14:48:07] <taplar> you have it as a var inside another scope
[14:48:15] <robertmaxrees> actually
[14:48:15] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:48:18] <hellyeah> aj
[14:48:20] <hellyeah> ah
[14:48:21] <robertmaxrees> he defines in in the handler.
[14:48:22] <hellyeah> yeah
[14:48:26] <robertmaxrees> but there's a chance it isn't defined.
[14:48:27] <hellyeah> ajax is async right
[14:48:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/rvgatgns/44/
[14:48:42] <hellyeah> but in second click it works
[14:48:43] <taplar> yeah, it's in the if
[14:48:55] <robertmaxrees> hellyeah the first time that runs, canvas isn't defined apparently.
[14:49:08] <robertmaxrees> notice how you're not getting your alert?
[14:49:13] <robertmaxrees> on the first click.
[14:49:29] <taplar> why do the ajax call outside the if?
[14:49:39] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[14:50:57] <hellyeah> it is not excuse but first i am dumb second i worked 16 hours yesterday and six hours todfay
[14:52:04] <hellyeah> fixed
[14:54:04] <hellyeah> you guys are so kind thank you
[14:56:59] <rizonz> is there a ways to convert some date and time formfields change to utc ?
[14:57:02] <rizonz> *UTC
[14:57:44] <taplar> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/prototype
[14:58:28] <rizonz> taplar: does that work on all browsers ?
[14:58:57] <taplar> it should list the browser support at the bottom for each of those methods
[14:59:11] <rizonz> What I have is the following, I let a user enter date and time in 2 formfields but need to post the UTC so I think I need to do that in the background realtime
[14:59:36] <rizonz> only FF, rest is unknown
[14:59:48] <taplar> ?
[14:59:55] <rizonz> for support
[15:00:06] <taplar> which one?
[15:00:33] <rizonz> the globa one, sorry
[15:01:05] <rizonz> but can I do that realtime in the background ?
[15:01:39] <taplar> you can perform the logic on any of the events the input drives, yes
[15:01:53] <hellyeah> man really dont understand this why i cannot get success msg in first click.ç https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/45/
[15:02:08] <hellyeah> thats so weird
[15:02:35] <hellyeah> it doesnt respond in first click
[15:02:36] <taplar> unless takeScreenShot is asynchronous
[15:02:55] <hellyeah> ah
[15:03:03] <hellyeah> i have to call that function inside success
[15:03:03] <taplar> seeing as how it takes a 'onrendered' input, i'd say it is
[15:03:22] <hellyeah> is it?
[15:03:34] <taplar> which function?
[15:03:43] <rizonz> taplar: ok let me play with it
[15:03:44] <hellyeah> takeScreenshot
[15:03:57] <taplar> you need the screenshot before you make the ajax call
[15:04:35] <hellyeah> i dont understand
[15:04:40] <hellyeah> can you explain again
[15:04:43] <taplar> lol
[15:04:51] <hellyeah> ops
[15:04:55] <taplar> the whole purpose of your ajax call is to send the screenshot to the server
[15:05:03] <taplar> without the screenshot to being with....
[15:05:03] <rizonz> taplar: I need to create some listener ?
[15:05:06] <hellyeah> this is what i did
[15:05:27] <taplar> i would extract that ajax logic out to it's own method, and call that method inside the onrendered callback
[15:05:39] <taplar> you could even pass it the canvas element you appended to the page to save a lookup
[15:05:41] <rizonz> mhh seems doable
[15:06:02] <hellyeah> sec
[15:06:04] <taplar> or don't even append the canvas to the body, if all you are doing that is so the ajax can find it.  passing it to the method would be enough
[15:06:43] <taplar> rizonz: yeah, whatever events setting that input generate, you have those as options to listen to
[15:07:43] <hellyeah> man
[15:07:45] <hellyeah> i hate this
[15:07:51] <hellyeah> my stomach hurts
[15:08:10] <taplar> what's up?
[15:11:18] <hellyeah> did you mean this? https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/45/
[15:11:36] <hellyeah> ajax wasnt done in first click again
[15:11:46] <hellyeah> when i clicked second time it worked
[15:11:47] <taplar> i'm not sure what you changed.
[15:11:59] <taplar> but no, this isn't what i was talking about
[15:12:30] <taplar> line 85, the canvas exists at that point, right?
[15:12:38] <hellyeah> ajax is in its function now
[15:13:12] <taplar> the if block isn't a function
[15:13:15] <hellyeah> yes
[15:13:21] <hellyeah> it exist
[15:13:36] <taplar> then you could call a method from line 85, passing in the canvas, that would perform the ajax logic
[15:13:37] <hellyeah> in line 85
[15:14:54] <hellyeah> like that https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/47/
[15:15:08] <hellyeah> damn
[15:15:09] <hellyeah> sorry
[15:16:38] <taplar> clicking calls takeScreenShot.  when onrendered happens, it calls the ajax
[15:17:07] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/48/
[15:17:24] <hellyeah> smt like that
[15:17:39] <taplar> pretty much, though make a better metohd name that 'call'
[15:19:12] <hellyeah> https://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/rvgatgns/49/
[15:19:47] <taplar> get rid of line 85 and sure
[15:19:50] <hellyeah> it should have passed canvas
[15:20:08] <hellyeah> document.body.appendChild(canvas);
[15:20:11] <hellyeah> that line
[15:20:19] <taplar> you don't need that line
[15:20:27] <taplar> you are passing the canvas to the method
[15:20:33] <hellyeah> yea
[15:21:52] <hellyeah> done
[15:22:13] <hellyeah> honestly i dont understand exactly what  is going on here
[15:22:22] <hellyeah> but i am gonna figure it out after resting i am sure
[15:26:54] <hellyeah> didnt work
[15:26:56] <hellyeah> pff
[15:26:58] <rizonz> taplar: does jquery-ui-timepicker does not have anything like it in it aready ? It can get the current time from the browser already
[15:44:37] <taplar> i'm not familiar with that plugin
[15:44:43] <catbadger> I'm back.
[15:44:49] <catbadger> been like 2 weeks lol
[18:49:00] <arosen> Any idea how to make something like this work:  var input = $(document.createElement("input"));     input.addEventListener('change', func, false); ?
[18:49:10] <arosen> I'm getting: Uncaught TypeError: input.addEventListener is not a function
[18:49:59] <taplar> var input = $('<input>");  input.on('change', function(){});
[18:50:08] <taplar> learn.jquery.com
[18:50:15] <arosen> thanks :)
[20:27:43] <rizonz> let' say I have a time like 02:00 and a date like 17-08-2017 how shall I convert the both to UTC ?
