[00:02:40] <LoneStar99> g.evening folks
[00:13:59] <victorkk> hey, can somebody help me with visualize plugin
[00:20:49] <victorkk> anyone?
[00:21:00] <Admax81> anywhere
[00:22:15] <victorkk> Admax81: thanks
[00:25:54] <ace``> hi i can't get a form from stopping the refresh of a page, i've tried preventdefault and it didnt work. here is the form / jquery code i'm working with http://jsfiddle.net/6wzZa/
[00:26:45] <Eviltwin> ace``: There is no element there with the class "slide-out-div"
[00:26:58] <Eviltwin> So your code is effectively doing nothing
[00:27:00] <coppa> hi there
[00:28:36] <victorkk> anybody who is using this plugin: http://filamentgroup.com/lab/update_to_jquery_visualize_accessible_charts_with_html5_from_designing_with/
[00:28:40] <victorkk> ?
[00:28:56] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ victorkk
[00:29:01] <Eviltwin> *sigh*
[00:29:15] <Eviltwin> Just ask your question, victorkk, don't try to look for experts on it
[00:29:20] <ace``> Eviltwin i didn't paste the CSS
[00:29:24] <ace``> in the jfiddle
[00:29:25] <victorkk> it was working great on 1.7.2
[00:29:34] <victorkk> not working at all with 1.8.x
[00:29:48] <LoneStar99> can someone tell me why a simple onclick does not work in jquery --> http://jsfiddle.net/Tp95Z/17/
[00:29:49] <Eviltwin> ace``: You're really, really new to this stuff aren't you?
[00:30:12] <ace``> lol
[00:30:14] <ace``> you're awesome
[00:30:16] <victorkk> Eviltwin: I am trying to find a solution for 2 days... no result
[00:30:35] <Eviltwin> LoneStar99: Can you tell me why there are so many lines for a "simple onclick"?
[00:31:00] <victorkk> Eviltwin: I've sent some mails to the developers, but still no answer, no info on google too :/
[00:31:15] <Eviltwin> victorkk: http://blog.jquery.com/2012/08/09/jquery-1-8-released/
[00:31:22] <ace``> Eviltwin: why would the CSS matter on jfiddle when it's irrelevant to what the form is doing? i didn't paste it for the obvious fact that it wasn't relevant
[00:31:28] <ace``> hot troll tho bro
[00:31:37] <victorkk> Eviltwin: Maybe it's using some deprecated stuff... Yeah, I've read the changes
[00:31:45] <Eviltwin> ace``: Dude, in your code you have $('.slide-out-div')
[00:31:49] <Eviltwin> ace``: Do you have any idea what that does?
[00:31:52] <LoneStar99> Eviltwin  onclick="getId(\''+ cc +'\')";
[00:31:55] <ace``> yes babe
[00:31:57] <victorkk> Eviltwin: I made my homework, but no success :/
[00:32:11] <ace``> when the form is submitted in the div slide-out-div
[00:32:14] <ace``> it calls the function
[00:32:20] <LoneStar99> then function getId(id) { ... } aint working
[00:32:21] <ace``> which the form submits fine
[00:32:24] <ace``> and does what i need it to
[00:32:37] <Eviltwin> LoneStar99: First: http://docs.jquery.com/Won't_Fix#Inline_Event_Handlers
[00:32:58] <LoneStar99> ReferenceError: getId is not defined
[00:33:16] <Eviltwin> LoneStar99: Second: This is not really a jQuery bug, it's an issue with the way you've written your JavaScript
[00:33:36] <Eviltwin> If you do function() { ... function xyz() { ... } ... } then xyz is not in global scope
[00:33:51] <Eviltwin> And inline event handlers only look for functions in global scope
[00:34:19] <LoneStar99> Eviltwin: yeah,  ok, what is a workaround to what I am trying to do?
[00:34:35] <Eviltwin> The right way to do this is to A) construct the element via $("<div...>") then use .click(...) on that
[00:34:43] <Eviltwin> At which point it will be in scope
[00:34:54] <Eviltwin> B) select the element by ID once it's added and use .click(...) on that
[00:35:13] <Eviltwin> Or C) move getId out of the $(document).ready(function() { ... })
[00:35:32] <Eviltwin> And make sure the Choose Framework menu is "no wrap (head)" instead of "onLoad"
[00:35:45] <victorkk> Eviltwin: Do you have any ideas about my problem? :/
[00:36:00] <Eviltwin> victorkk: I don't use the plugin
[00:36:03] <Eviltwin> So not really, no
[00:36:12] <Eviltwin> But my guess would be they used one of those features that has been removed
[00:36:28] <Eviltwin> LoneStar99: Those are ordered from best to worst
[00:36:52] <LoneStar99> ok thanks
[00:37:15] <LoneStar99> going to use the worse one this time =)
[00:37:35] <Eviltwin> *sigh* And this is why I just shouldn't tell people about the worst options
[00:38:19] <slick-> oh my god
[00:38:23] <slick-> someone please help
[00:38:31] <slick-> work project due in 6 hours
[00:38:34] <slick-> draggable isnt working
[00:38:38] <slick-> resizable works
[00:39:05] <LoneStar99> thanks Eviltwin
[00:39:27] <slick-> god damn
[00:40:10] <victorkk> Eviltwin: those deprecated features are not so much :/ I've checked the code... and I think they are not using those
[00:41:03] <Eviltwin> victorkk: Well I don't really know what to tell you. I don't have time to read through some random plugin to figure out why it's not working in 1.8+ and used to work in <=1.7
[00:41:03] <slick-> hey can someone tell me why my resiable is not working
[00:41:04] <slick-> http://jsfiddle.net/xEL3r/
[00:41:06] <slick-> <3 tia
[00:41:30] <Eviltwin> victorkk: If you're familiar with the Web Inspector you might be able to debug it a bit and figure out the problem area
[00:41:44] <Eviltwin> victorkk: If not, get familiar, it's your friend: http://fixingthesejquery.com/
[00:42:07] <victorkk> Eviltwhin: It is something like firebug? or...
[00:42:11] <Eviltwin> Yes
[00:42:19] <Eviltwin> But most people don't know what all it can do
[00:44:30] <victorkk> Eviltwin: Let me check it
[00:46:57] <victorkk> Eviltwin: The funny thing is that firebug is not showing any errors at all :/
[00:47:23] <Eviltwin> So you're probably going to have to use breakpoints to see what is happening in 1.7 and not happening in 1.8
[00:47:55] <victorkk> Eviltwin: Huh... installing Chrome now :/
[00:50:40] <Eviltwin> Also "not working" is probably the least descriptive thing you can say about a bug / error
[00:50:49] <Eviltwin> Always try to be more specific than that
[00:51:00] <Eviltwin> Inspect the elements and see if classes have been added
[00:51:10] <Eviltwin> Try clicking things and seeing if any click handlers fire
[00:51:20] <victorkk> Eviltwin: Yes, the classes are added, it is just not visualised :/
[00:51:55] <victorkk> Eviltwin: I know that "not working" is a bad explanation, but i just don't have another info... no errors, no messages, nothing :/
[00:52:27] <Eviltwin> Well use Chrome's ability to break on mouse events to see if there are any listeners attached via jQuery etc
[00:52:36] <Eviltwin> Or poke at $._data(element, "events") on the elements
[00:52:49] <Eviltwin> There's a lot going on in this plugin
[00:53:02] <Eviltwin> You need to figure out where things stop behaving properly
[00:53:03] <victorkk> Eviltwin: this plugin has nothing to do with mouse events :/
[00:53:31] <victorkk> Eviltwin: It just visualizes a table into a nice looking chart (pie, etc)
[00:53:40] <Eviltwin> Oh my mistake
[00:53:49] <Eviltwin> I thought I saw some references to clicks in here
[00:54:37] <Eviltwin> While it's not optimal
[00:54:42] <Eviltwin> If you can't figure out a better way
[00:54:49] <slick-> Eviltwin sir
[00:54:55] <Eviltwin> You can pull up a page that has this with <=1.7
[00:54:57] <slick-> would you know why my draggable function isnt working
[00:55:02] <Eviltwin> And an identical page except with 1.8+
[00:55:06] <Eviltwin> And pause them both
[00:55:07] <slick-> or know how i can debug it so i would know why
[00:55:09] <Eviltwin> Then step through
[00:55:16] <victorkk> Eviltwin: Even this web inspector is not giving me any errors :/
[00:55:18] <Eviltwin> slick-: Don't use draggable
[00:55:24] <slick-> oh realy
[00:55:24] <victorkk> Eviltwin: Strange :(
[00:55:29] <slick-> is there an alternative?
[00:55:34] <slick-> i need to have this measurement tool be movable
[00:56:29] <jonkristian> Can php set a session when called via ajax?
[00:57:28] <Eviltwin> victorkk: See http://jsfiddle.net/f3v9X/ and http://jsfiddle.net/f3v9X/1/
[00:57:35] <Eviltwin> Exact same code except two different versions of jQuery
[00:57:45] <Eviltwin> I bet you they produce different results but neither results in an error
[00:59:24] <jonkristian> Eviltwin: that's funny
[01:00:10] <victorkk> Eviltwin: Great example :/
[01:00:30] <victorkk> Eviltwin: How can I use it in my case :)
[01:01:14] <slick-> should i use jquery drag instead of draggable? http://threedubmedia.com/code/event/drag
[01:01:34] <Admax81> jon, yes u can set a session with ajax. when session_start() called, he try to find session key in browser cache
[01:02:00] <Eviltwin> slick-: http://jsfiddle.net/cYFhr/
[01:02:32] <Admax81> so, it not depends on ajax or ant else. if browser keep cache, he found session id and load user session correctly
[01:02:33] <slick-> Eviltwin: i think i love you
[01:03:00] <Eviltwin> victorkk: Like I said, you pause it, trigger the visualize thing, and step through
[01:03:12] <jonkristian> Admax81: I am calling a function that saves something to the session, however that doesn't seem to work.
[01:03:12] <LoneStar99> Eviltwin: how would i remove all appended content to a div?
[01:03:14] <Eviltwin> They should be doing the exact same thing for a little bit and then start doing different things
[01:03:31] <jonkristian> Admax81: Is this what I need? http://mohrt.blogspot.no/2009/11/ajax-and-php-sessions.html
[01:03:35] <Eviltwin> LoneStar99: Uh, is .empty() what you're looking for?
[01:03:47] <LoneStar99> oh yeah
[01:04:01] <Eviltwin> jonkristian: Worth a shot
[01:04:11] <jonkristian> Eviltwin: okay
[01:06:40] <Admax81> u must start session in php file, where u send post data..
[01:06:48] <jonkristian> Admax81: Yes, of course
[01:06:52] <jonkristian> I start it
[01:07:22] <jonkristian> But the session variable is not stored
[01:07:55] <jonkristian> Admax81: hm, actually, i only start it in my index.php
[01:08:06] <Eviltwin> jonkristian: To be honest what you're describing is really a PHP problem, not a jQuery problem. I suggest asking ##php for more info
[01:08:28] <jonkristian> Eviltwin: well it works without jquery
[01:08:34] <Admax81> u can try use session_id($id) for load user session for sure
[01:08:36] <jonkristian> Eviltwin: But i understand
[01:09:03] <nayers1981> Could someone please look at this and see why this may not be working i was working with someone earlier and they arent around no more. http://pastie.org/4694274
[01:09:10] <Admax81> u send request to index.php
[01:09:12] <Admax81> ?
[01:09:21] <jonkristian> Eviltwin: All i wanted to know was if it would work at all.
[01:09:33] <jonkristian> Admax81: No, i have an external processor.php that handles all that
[01:10:08] <Admax81> so type session_start(); in beggin of file (after <?php of course) :)
[01:10:13] <jonkristian> Admax81: will try that
[01:10:53] <jonkristian> Admax81: it works!
[01:10:59] <jonkristian> Admax81: thank you!
[01:11:21] <Eviltwin> nayers1981: Do $(document).on('click', 'a', function() { ... }) instead of $('a').click(function() { ... })
[01:11:44] <Eviltwin> Then you can go to api.jquery.com/on and read about event delegation
[01:12:31] <nayers1981> thanks ill try that.
[01:17:54] <Admax81> how to send private message? :)
[01:18:07] <Eviltwin> Probably by typing /MSG nicknamegoeshere Message goes here
[01:18:17] <b0x> or /query PersonsNickHere
[01:18:26] <b0x> will open a new window generally
[01:18:56] <b0x> try to ask before pm'ing
[01:19:39] <Admax81> Eviltwin: test
[01:19:46] <Eviltwin> That one happened in the channel
[01:19:51] <Eviltwin> Not in the private message
[01:19:51] <b0x> lol
[01:20:01] <Admax81> :)
[01:20:23] <jonkristian>  /query i belive
[01:20:24] <Admax81> i mean, message in the chanel, but with hightlight to person
[01:20:52] <Eviltwin> That's done by typing: nickname: message
[01:20:54] <Eviltwin> Like you just did
[01:21:04] <Admax81> jonkrisian, u send me a message and i saw it buy red hightlight
[01:21:06] <Eviltwin> But is very different from a private message
[01:21:13] <Admax81> oh, ok :)
[01:21:16] <xec_> Admax81: most clients have tab completion on nicks, start typing a nick and hit tab to see
[01:21:31] <Eviltwin> Admax81: That's because he was talking to you but within this room
[01:21:40] <Eviltwin> So everyone could see it but the message was directed at you
[01:22:02] <Admax81> thanks! :)
[01:27:17] <slick-> Eviltwin: im using this code, http://jsfiddle.net/cYFhr/ but everytime i go to drag it
[01:27:21] <slick-> it goes behind all the other divs
[01:27:22] <slick-> :(
[01:28:18] <jonkristian> slick-: z-index maybe?
[01:28:24] <slick-> tried z-index 9999
[01:28:30] <slick-> and position: absolute/relative
[01:28:51] <slick-> maybe cuz i didnt turn off draggable
[01:29:54] <jonkristian> slick-: I dont experience that
[01:30:04] <slick-> damn
[01:30:08] <slick-> just my luck lol
[01:30:14] <jonkristian> http://jsfiddle.net/cYFhr/1/
[01:30:38] <jonkristian> slick-: actually i see it now
[01:30:44] <slick-> oh really
[01:30:50] <slick-> god pls tell me u know how to fix it
[01:31:01] <slick-> <3
[01:31:11] <Already> Hi everyone! Wold anybody know why .click would report the parent elemtn of the a link? (Which was added .append)
[01:31:44] <juha_> Already: wrong selector
[01:31:52] <jonkristian> slick-: maybe it has something to do with your position: absolute; not sure tho.
[01:32:04] <slick-> k cool
[01:32:20] <jonkristian> slick-: but for simple drag and drop that looks like a lot of code.
[01:32:30] <slick-> i tried doing draggable
[01:32:30] <slick-> dont work
[01:32:47] <Already> juha_ I tried the class of the link, the a element itself and div > a, neither worked. Any idea what would be the correct selector?
[01:32:48] <slick-> resizable works draggable doesnt
[01:33:20] <Eviltwin> slick-: http://jsfiddle.net/cYFhr/2/
[01:34:35] <slick-> Eviltwin: same problem
[01:35:09] <jonkristian> slick-: you coud use sortable
[01:35:13] <jonkristian> could*
[01:35:14] <slick-> oh
[01:35:16] <slick-> whats sortable
[01:35:23] <jonkristian> I believe it's a library
[01:35:24] <slick-> is jquery.event.drag a good alternative
[01:35:25] <slick-> to draggable
[01:35:26] <slick-> oh
[01:35:33] <Eviltwin> http://jsfiddle.net/cYFhr/5/
[01:36:02] <juha_> Already: hard to say as i do not know what your code looks like. post something to jsfiddle and someone will have a look
[01:36:47] <jonkristian> slick-: set z-index: 999 when it's moving, then remove the z-index, in theory that should work
[01:36:56] <slick-> oh
[01:37:15] <Already> Ok. In that case I probably should clean it up first ... well maybe the error gets fixed that way. :)
[01:38:06] <slick-> rofl what Eviltwin posted works
[01:38:07] <slick-> !
[01:38:09] <slick-> i love you Eviltwin
[01:38:11] <slick-> have my babies
[01:38:27] <slick-> it drags pretty inaccurately though
[01:38:28] <slick-> w
[01:38:29] <slick-> weird
[01:38:34] <jonkristian> Hm, Are you sure?
[01:38:53] <jonkristian> Anyways, http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/
[01:42:20] <slick-> it wouldnt work with resizable though
[01:42:22] <slick-> goes all wonky
[01:42:26] <slick-> thanks jonkristian will try this
[01:48:59] <kaliya> hi. i have a JSON string like [{"it":"30.00"},{"com":"30.00"}], I parse it through var obj = jQuery.parseJSON(mystring), but how to access data then?? ex. obj.<something for "it"> i want to return 30? TIA :)
[01:50:51] <masak> kaliya: obj[0]['it']
[01:50:55] <masak> should work.
[01:51:36] <kaliya> thank you a lot masak :)
[01:51:38] <masak> kaliya: the [0] is to grab the zeroth element of the [] array. the ['it'] is to grab the value of the "it" key.
[01:54:12] <kaliya> good masak very kind from you
[01:55:42] <Already> Shouldn't obj.it work as well? Or is getJSON way different from parseJSON?
[01:57:11] <Eviltwin> obj[0].it
[01:57:17] <Eviltwin> Is the same as obj[0]['it']
[01:57:45] <kaliya> Already: doesn't work here...
[02:06:41] <fuchstronaut> having an URL like http://localhost/a/b my ajax leads me to http://localhost/a/my_url_param when passing the ajax-function "my_url_param" as url property
[02:06:59] <fuchstronaut> how do i fix this so my request is sent to localhost/a/b/my_url_param ?
[02:09:57] <sssilver> Hello people of #jquery
[02:10:11] <sssilver> I'm looking to create a jQuery plugin that would render a timeline inside a given element
[02:10:28] <masak> kaliya: I'm doing this in the Chrome console: var obj = JSON.parse('[{"it":"30.00"},{"com":"30.00"}]'); obj[0]['it'] -- it works.
[02:10:34] <sssilver> the typical way to go about it is to generate all the necessary elements in it with my Javascript?
[02:10:35] <masak> kaliya: what are you doing different?
[02:16:35] <Already> Sorry kaliya I didn't have a proper look at the json so I missed that it was an array and thanks Eviltwin for pointing that out.
[02:18:22] <Already> sssilver that largly depens on your usecase, i'd say. You could tell people they have to have some kind of structure in place.
[02:19:40] <fuchstronaut> when there's no / trailing the url in my address bar, relative urls will take me one level back, how do i prevent that from happening?
[02:23:29] <sssilver> Already: I see, thanks!
[02:24:03] <sssilver> So, if I'm constructing a timeline out of, say, some complicated JSON data, it's OK to be like $('#element').timeline(json_data); ?
[02:24:25] <sssilver> or is it better to be like $.timeline('#element', json_data);
[02:30:10] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Anyone experience with datatables?
[02:30:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> datatables.net that is
[02:36:04] <demetan> is it possible in the same autocomplet input, to do queries on on two or more fields ?
[02:42:00] <alket> Hi, Where can I find a jQuery Scroll Pagionation which fetch data from MySQL with PHP ?
[02:44:24] <Cork> ?g jquery pagination sql query php
[02:44:25] <b-ot> Cork, Pagination with Jquery, PHP , Ajax and MySQL. → http://www.9lessons.info/2010/10/pagination-with-jquery-php-ajax-and.html
[02:49:43] <ecky--ptang-zoob> When you style something with jquery... it always loads the unstyled stuff first and styles it after the page is loaded... is it possible to style it instantly? Because on slow connections it shows the unstyled version for a second or so...
[02:50:59] <diverdude> hello. Why does this example not print 'classB' on second click of the link labeled 'hi' ? http://jsfiddle.net/H4RH8/4/
[02:52:34] <diverdude> or...better yet...why does this one not alternate between A and B ? http://jsfiddle.net/H4RH8/5/
[02:56:36] <ecky--ptang-zoob> diverdude: why don't you use toggle () ?
[02:57:15] <diverdude> ecky--ptang-zoob: that makes no difference
[02:57:52] <ecky--ptang-zoob> this you need: http://api.jquery.com/toggleClass/
[02:59:10] <diverdude> ecky--ptang-zoob: i tried toggle....still the correct handler is not invoked
[02:59:25] <ecky--ptang-zoob> tried toggleClass?
[03:01:38] <diverdude> ecky--ptang-zoob: yes
[03:02:28] <diverdude> ecky--ptang-zoob: here: http://jsfiddle.net/H4RH8/7/
[03:03:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> diverdude: works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/H4RH8/5/
[03:03:50] <Palanivel> hihi....i have a bid doubt......what is the diff b/win  html <input type='text' value="palani"> and jquery $('input').val()
[03:03:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> let me paste mine
[03:04:23] <diverdude> ecky--ptang-zoob: what do you mean? it does not work
[03:04:24] <Cork> Palanivel: one is html and the other is a jquery command line
[03:04:35] <Palanivel> if input tag having value but its no showing inside of the textbox
[03:04:38] <Cork> or should i say statement
[03:05:12] <Cork> ?p @ Palanivel
[03:05:12] <bot-t> Palanivel, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:05:20] <xec_> diverdude: a couple solutions to this, one is to use delegation: http://jsfiddle.net/H4RH8/8/
[03:05:28] <Palanivel> ya that i know...........if an using $('input').val('palani') mean's the value is showing in text box but not in html
[03:06:13] <Palanivel> @bot-t.......its vaery simple
[03:06:23] <seutje> diverdude: http://jsfiddle.net/H4RH8/9/ what ur looking for?
[03:07:09] <Palanivel> if input tag contain one more attribute as value means that val is not showing in that input txt box......but by using jquery that value is showing'
[03:07:35] <Palanivel> what is the diff in those two
[03:08:08] <seutje> did he just tell bot-t what's up?
[03:08:29] <xec_> diverdude: the other is to use simple logic http://jsfiddle.net/H4RH8/10/ -- seutje's solution does both
[03:09:13] <seutje> guess I could have positively discriminated towards links :P
[03:10:01] <xec_> actually, this one demonstrates better whats going on http://jsfiddle.net/H4RH8/11/
[03:10:01] <seutje> I forgot to preventDefault though
[03:10:24] <seutje> -> http://jsfiddle.net/H4RH8/12/
[03:11:50] <xec_> diverdude: do you see what's going on? when you bind an event handler to an element it stays bound regardless if the original selector used still matches or not
[03:18:20] <Palanivel> @bot-t u got my poin r not
[03:18:20] <b-ot> Palanivel, no U got my poin r not
[03:18:55] <Palanivel> @cork..........Ar u got my point
[03:18:56] <b-ot> Palanivel, no U got my point
[03:26:00] <ENQ> hello, i have a question about array.prototype, this is an example http://jsfiddle.net/fSsx3/, idk why but prototype function appiers on same level as array values, so i cant loop throw values becouse there is not only numbers but first(function name) too
[03:26:02] <shoky> Palanivel, .val(...) sets the node's value _property_ which isn't shown back as an html _attribute_
[03:26:24] <shoky> Palanivel, and the property is what's important for form submits
[03:27:06] <Palanivel> @shoky.....thankzzzzzzzzzz
[03:27:13] <shoky> that's my current understanding at least.
[03:27:42] <shoky> er and the property is what's important for what shows up in the field, too
[03:50:01] <diverdude> xec: yeah i thought it was something like that
[03:50:15] <diverdude> xec: thats why i tried the .on() instead of .click()
[03:50:28] <diverdude> xec: is there any way i can rebind?
[03:50:53] <xec_> .on('click', func) does exactly the same as .click(func)
[03:52:01] <xec_> $(someParentElementWhichDoesntChange).on('click', 'selector', func) will delegate the event handling
[03:52:14] <xec_> did you see the first example i linked?
[03:52:22] <xec_> diverdude ^
[03:53:11] <diverdude> xec: ahh im sorry ill read further up...i went to lunch, thats why i was so long responding :)
[03:54:01] <diverdude> xec: ahhh right...yes...your on example...come to think of it that was actually what i was trying to do....great. thanks :)
[03:55:58] <farid> Hi I  need some help with some jquery I am trying.. I am new to Jquery
[03:56:33] <farid> I have a form .. when submitting I want to display a modal window and one the person clicks the modal indow i want to submit the form
[04:27:03] <fuchstronaut> How do I match either textarea or input with a given name?
[04:27:34] <Chris_CC> Hi guys, farily new to jquery and have a problem ,i want jquery to through an alaert box and stop form submission, I have this working when there is 1 form, but when there are MANY i don;t know how to make it ONLY check the form that the submit button is from.. help http://pastebin.com/n7vTM65D   demo at www.carclubbed.com/alpha (login with email = bmw_z3_1@email.com pass = passwordccalpha)
[04:27:43] <Chris_CC> throw*
[04:27:47] <Chris_CC> alert*
[04:27:50] <Chris_CC> wow.. its early
[04:29:27] <Chris_CC> I'm a dumbass.. fixed
[04:30:03] <fuchstronaut> no problem
[04:30:05] <fuchstronaut> :-P
[04:30:17] <Chris_CC> haha, sometimes just need to explain the problem to see the issue :P
[04:30:25] <Cork> fuchstronaut: $('input, textarea')
[04:30:53] <Cork> or $(parent).find('input, textarea') if you want to match a subset
[04:30:56] <fuchstronaut> Cork: given name, would be like input[name=myName], textarea[name=myName]
[04:31:12] * Cork nods
[04:31:30] <fuchstronaut> i just wonder of theres something like (input OR textarea)[name=myName]
[04:31:37] <Cork> nope
[04:31:44] <fuchstronaut> so ill have to regex
[04:31:46] <fuchstronaut> thanks anyway
[04:32:26] <Cork> fuchstronaut: though you should prob use a class instead
[04:33:09] <fuchstronaut> I'm getting a string with a selector for elements, might be 'input', could be 'input, textarea'. later I'm getting a list of name and i have to match all elements with the given names
[04:33:20] <fuchstronaut> so i thought ill just regex a selector
[04:33:41] <Cork> $('selector').filter('[name=myName')
[04:33:48] <Cork> *$('selector').filter('[name=myName]')
[04:33:56] <fuchstronaut> well
[04:34:06] <fuchstronaut> thats good, thanks
[04:35:07] <Cork> that said i would recommend to use quotes around the name value
[04:35:13] <Cork> ex. *$('selector').filter('[name="myName"]')
[04:35:36] <Cork> that makes sure the value doens't mess with your selectors
[04:35:55] <Cork> like this would for example *$('selector').filter('[name="name[]"]')
[04:36:16] <Cork> (without the stars)
[04:40:19] <fuchstronaut> Thanks cork!
[04:40:41] <masak> any suggestions for good jQuery dead-tree books out there?
[04:59:53] <greek> Hey fellas. With jQuery UI tabs, can I enable some kinda of default "+" button next to the tab headings to conveniently add a new tab?  (kinda like in a web browser) Or do I have to program a separate button?
[05:02:10] <computer2000> anyone knows about a service which will fill in random images into <img /> elements? for testing layouts, for example. i once knew one service which used random kitten images, but i forgot the url
[05:02:38] <kborchers> computer2000: placekitten.com
[05:03:01] <computer2000> kborchers: wooohoo thx
[05:04:06] <kborchers> greek: you would need to do that yourself but shouldn't be too hard. add a tab at the end of your tabs that just has a + and has empty content, on it's click event, create a new tab, insert and refresh the tabs.
[05:04:54] <greek> kborchers, ok thanks for the tip it makes perfect sense. On a side note, I wonder why this isn't a built-in feature of jquery ui tabs?
[05:05:52] <kborchers> greek: it kind of is, see http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#method-add
[05:06:08] <kborchers> greek: you'll just need to hook that up to the click event of your + tab
[05:06:31] <greek> kborchers, ok cool thanks again
[05:13:07] <scruz> hi. how can i pull json data from a local nosql server into a page? i've tried using $.ajax() and when i specify the data type as json, i get the origin null error. when i try to specify jsonp, i get parse errors
[05:13:48] <Cork> scruz: you want to add the json before the page load?
[05:13:56] <scruz> cork: after.
[05:14:15] <Cork> so you want to ajax the nosql server?
[05:14:25] <scruz> i'm basically fooling around before i learn backbone
[05:14:29] <scruz> yes, i do.
[05:14:44] <Cork> its on the same domain name (including sub domain)
[05:14:46] <Cork> ?
[05:14:53] <scruz> no, actually.
[05:15:03] <Cork> then you can't do it cross browser
[05:15:06] <scruz> the test file i opened from my file manager.
[05:15:20] <scruz> the nosql server is locally hosted
[05:15:23] <Cork> jsonp isn't json, its javascript files loaded containing javascript objects
[05:15:38] <Cork> and that can "simulate" json
[05:15:51] <Cork> but the server have to submitt the expected jsonp scripts
[05:16:25] <Cork> csp headers can allow it, but not all browsers on the market supports it
[05:16:32] <Cork> ?mdn csp
[05:16:33] <bot-t> Cork, Couldn't find "mdn csp" in jQuery Docs.

[05:49:33] <hazamonzo> hey folks, i have an array or arrays. Looks like this. http://wstaw.org/m/2012/09/10/plasma-desktopBi3959.jpg How might i setach for "cu" and return "Cuba" ?
[05:50:04] <hazamonzo> *array of arrays
[05:51:33] <Cork> $.grep(arr, fucntion(a) { return a[1] == 'cu'; })[1];
[05:51:35] <faraway> hazamonzo: why do you use array of arrays and not an Object with cu as key and Cuba as value ?
[05:51:41] <hooloovoo> hazamonzo: for( var i = 0, il = array.length; i<il; i++ ) { var res = array[i]; if (keyword === res[0]) return res[1]; }
[05:52:02] <Cork> bah...
[05:52:10] <Cork> * $.grep(arr, function(a) { return a[0] == 'cu'; })[1];
[05:52:11] <hazamonzo> Multiple solutions! :D
[05:52:14] <hooloovoo> pfft
[05:52:23] <hooloovoo> i didn't even know $.grep existed =P
[05:52:28] <hazamonzo> faraway: Don't ask me mate. This isn't my application :)
[05:52:29] <blackspotwiggins> hazamonzo, if that's all you are using it for, go for objects instead
[05:52:37] <blackspotwiggins> what faraway said
[05:52:42] * Cork nods
[05:52:57] <Cork> that would make it much simpler to search
[05:53:39] <mathewrapid> arr.filter(function(item) {return item[0] === 'cu'})[0][1]
[05:54:33] <Cork> mathewrapid: not sure thats fully cross browser
[05:54:43] <hazamonzo> perfect! lots of solutions. And yeah, the array is pretty poor but its out of my control :(
[05:54:44] <mathewrapid> es5 shim then
[05:55:01] <mathewrapid> has anyone looked at dojos object store?
[05:55:21] <mathewrapid> it has a wonderful query method
[05:57:45] <bjensen> Can anyone recommend anything for capturing specific keyboard combos? ctrl + y for example?
[05:59:20] <juha_> bjensen: http://whatthekeycode.com/
[05:59:39] <Cork> bjensen: just bind a event listner to document
[06:00:37] <scruz> ack. even on different ports, i can't do an xmlhr from my web server to my nosql server
[06:02:52] <bjensen> juha_: http://whatthekeycode.com/ does not support ctrl + y, only y
[06:03:12] <bjensen> how do I say 17 (ctrl) + 89 (y) ?
[06:03:53] <bjensen> http://api.jquery.com/keypress/ : "In addition, modifier keys (such as Shift) trigger keydown events but not keypress events."
[06:05:50] <juha_> bjensen: dude, it works. you need to check what was the first key and what was the second
[06:12:07] <greek> kborchers, I've almost gotten the + tab functionality to work. Only problem I'm having is that the focus is being change to the + tab's panel after the new tab is added just before it. Any idea how to prevent this from happening?
[06:13:07] <bjensen> juha_: any idea why this simple example doesn't work then?
[06:13:07] <greek> Right at the end of my "add tab" event, I'm going "select newly added tab", which is firing correctly, but then after the "add tab" event's code is complete, it still swaps focus to the + tab's panel
[06:13:14] <bjensen> juha_: http://jsfiddle.net/bM6uY/89/
[06:14:46] <kborchers> greek: hmm, you probably need event.preventDefault() (or what ever you called the event you're passing in to your click handler) to stop it from performing the default action of clicking your tab
[06:15:20] <greek> kborchers, yeah I tried event.preventDefault() to no avail :9i
[06:15:52] <kborchers> greek: if you can put your tabs in a fiddle i could take a look
[06:15:57] <shoky> bjensen: use keyup/keydown
[06:16:09] <blackspotwiggins> bjensen, use keydown
[06:16:11] <ecky--ptang-zoob> anyone experience with jquery tabs?
[06:16:29] <kborchers> ?ask @ ecky--ptang-zoob
[06:16:30] <bot-t> ecky--ptang-zoob, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:16:33] <blackspotwiggins> you even copypasted a line that explicitly said that it wont work with keypress
[06:16:39] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Ok
[06:17:00] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'm using jquery tabs (from jquery ui) - They work fine, but... I want one tab to actually link to a url
[06:17:04] <greek> kborchers, http://pastie.org/4695618
[06:17:07] <bjensen> cooool! thanks juha_, blackspotwiggins and shoky  :)
[06:17:18] <greek> ok cool will do
[06:17:18] <ecky--ptang-zoob> like having a tab called google... clicking the tab does not load content in the container, but goes to an external url
[06:17:27] <ecky--ptang-zoob> possible?
[06:17:44] <juha_> bjensen: http://jsfiddle.net/bM6uY/91/
[06:18:00] <pangelovski> hi guys
[06:18:35] <hooloovoo> hi pangelovski
[06:19:04] <pangelovski> I'm trying to implement a slide transition on my nested list. i tried adding a data-transition to my li tags but nothing happens. I tried google but no luck
[06:19:12] <davetarmac> hey guys
[06:19:25] <davetarmac> wonder if someone can shed some light on an issue
[06:19:57] <davetarmac> Need to put a class on a div where an attribute matches something (I have this: jQuery('div[qtip|="2"]').addClass('big-people-menu');)
[06:20:34] <davetarmac> however, that is in a document.ready - and the element doesn't exist until another element is hovered over
[06:21:01] <kborchers> greek: hmmm, i think maybe you want var tab_index = num_tabs - 2; to be before the +, correct? a fiddle would have been better so i could play with it :)
[06:21:50] <greek> kborchers, sorry I pasted that just before I read your fiddle comment, I'm busy preparing a fiddle now
[06:22:04] <kborchers> greek: oh, ok
[06:22:08] <therealkoopa> When you use display: none to hide an element, the elements are re-rendered when they are displayed. Are they also re-rendered when doing this with visibility: hidden
[06:22:39] <shoky> therealklanni: visibility: hidden doesn't affect layout
[06:22:47] <shoky> or flow
[06:22:50] <shoky> or whatever its called
[06:23:11] <shoky> davetarmac: and ?
[06:23:16] <therealkoopa> I know that the element still takes up space and is still there, but I'm curious if it's 're--rendered'
[06:23:31] <davetarmac> shoky: 'and ?'?
[06:24:00] <kborchers> ecky--ptang-zoob: if you just change the href of the tab to google.com, doesn't it work?
[06:24:13] <shoky> davetarmac: running that when the element doesn't exist won't do anything.. so run it when it exists ?
[06:24:26] <davetarmac> shoky: that's the bit I don't know how to do
[06:24:41] <shoky> put it after the code that creates that element..
[06:24:42] <davetarmac> been looking on your friend and mine, Google - but can't see what I'm looking for
[06:24:52] <davetarmac> ohhh
[06:24:56] <davetarmac> that simple? really?
[06:25:07] <shoky> i dont know, you haven't given enough details
[06:25:33] <shoky> you haven't even said what the problem is, really, you're waiting for us to guess
[06:26:14] <shoky> when do you want to add that class to the element?
[06:26:30] <davetarmac> I would like to add the class to the element when it appears
[06:26:33] <blackspotwiggins> inb4 use a callback
[06:26:38] <shoky> why not just have it there on the html tag
[06:26:44] <shoky> class="big-people-menu"
[06:26:57] <davetarmac> because it's dynamic using qtip
[06:27:09] <davetarmac> and for some reason the width isn't being picked up correctly
[06:28:01] <davetarmac> probably because of the float on there
[06:28:27] <shoky> shrugs
[06:28:27] <b-ot> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[06:28:36] <greek> kborchers, for some reason I cannot get the tabs to initialise properly in jsfiddle but this is 99% of the fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Fx8aG/
[06:29:20] <davetarmac> to see the problem, look at the source here http://allenbridge.launcharea.co.uk/ - then hover over People and you'll notice that the div with qtip="2" appears then
[06:29:30] <davetarmac> rather than being there when the page loads
[06:31:38] <^Mike> Where can I read the changelog for the jquery date chooser?
[06:32:45] <^Mike> We are seeing that as you click forward in the calendar, you see Sept, Oct, Sept, Oct, Nov... which is wrong. Since we just use the vanilla jquery thing, and the bug is fairly obvious, I am suspecting that this is a bug that may have been fixed already.
[06:35:31] <pangelovski> anyone that knows how to do transition on a nested list
[06:38:25] <^Mike> hm, apparently we are using "jQuery UI Datepicker 1.8.1" which seems to be the current version O.o
[06:38:44] <shoky> davetarmac: a workaround could be.. $('.mainmenu-people').mouseenter(function() {  $('div[qtip|=2]').addClass('big-people-menu') });
[06:40:00] <ansolas> is there a more convenient way when creating html strings in jQuery e.g: http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/zEW3e/
[06:40:19] <ansolas> is there a trick that i do not have to concatinate stings ?
[06:40:32] <ansolas> ....without using atemplate engione ?
[06:40:38] <davetarmac> shoky: that works a treat
[06:40:41] <davetarmac> thanks for that
[06:43:05] <davetarmac> that worked to get the class on the element - just need to work out why the damn menu is so narrow now
[06:44:13] <zii> Jquery-ui 1.8.12 datepicker isn't setting the date back to what I set it, when reopened. .datepicker("setDate", '01/01/2001') for example doesn't work either. Any ideas why?
[06:44:17] <shoky> if it weren't for all that drupal chaos, i'd try to help further :P
[06:45:00] <hlve> Hiya shoky!
[06:45:01] <hlve> :o
[06:45:07] <shoky> hy dood
[06:45:45] <eip56> morning
[06:47:55] <greek> kborchers, any ideas with the fiddle?
[06:48:06] <greek> No worries if you're busy. I figured perhaps you missed my reply earlier.
[06:48:38] <kborchers> greek: i am busy but looking too :)  give me a few minutes
[06:49:47] <kborchers> greek: ok, got something for you
[06:50:39] <kborchers> first, don't put the tag names before your id's … not necessary. second, you had your add tab and your add tab panel with the same id, that won't work
[06:50:44] <belgo> hi, I got 2 link with string like "Your selection (5)" and I want to update the 5 with a new value , I don't found the good regex to use with replace (I try $('body a.selection').html().replace("\D", newval);
[06:51:21] <greek> kborchers, yeah I renamed the duplicate IDs just now after I spotted that too
[06:51:32] <kborchers> greek: the main thing is there may be a bug in tabs but i have to verify that and i'll file one if there is and it isn't already known but you need to delay your select http://jsfiddle.net/Fx8aG/4/
[06:53:09] <^Mike> Okay, so it looks like we're probably not using some really old buggy version of jquery ui datepicker - what could cause it to show the months repeated like that? (Sept, Oct, Sept, Oct, Nov, Dec...)
[06:53:10] <shoky> what's that setTimeout doing?
[06:53:32] <shoky> seems to work the same for me without it
[06:53:43] <greek> kborchers, yeah ok I see how your timeout works. My suspicion is that there is indeed a bug, because it correctly selects the new tab the first time we add one. But every tab after that it breas.
[06:53:45] <greek> *breaks
[06:53:55] <shoky> o
[06:54:14] <kborchers> greek: yep, and it fails on master so i'll check the bug tracker and file one if it's not already known
[06:54:41] * greek is glad that his discovery may contribute to the open source movement ;)
[06:54:54] <pachet> ?eval 'your selection (5)'.replace(/\d/, '2')
[06:54:56] <bot-t> pachet: "your selection (2)"
[06:54:58] <pachet> belgo^
[06:55:39] <greek> kborchers, thanks for all the help :) I'll use the setTimeout technique in the mean time. Any tips for how I can stay up to date with the bug report / fix in later releases (so that I know when it's safe to remove the timeout hack)?
[07:00:07] <kborchers> greek: if it's determined to actually be a bug, you can keep an eye on it here http://bugs.jqueryui.com/ticket/8562 … you could always submit a fix too :)
[07:01:34] <greek> kborchers, ok cool thanks for that. Will the jQuery developers know how to re-create this issue based on that description?
[07:01:47] <greek> Unless you're part of the jquery team? Forgive me I'm still new here
[07:02:22] <hlve> you're forgiven
[07:02:51] <kborchers> greek: i am part of the team ;) and i just added a comment with links to how to recreate but thanks for thinking of that as most people submitting tickets do not :)
[07:03:21] <greek> kborchers, awesome thanks man :)
[07:03:26] <kborchers> np
[07:12:25] <Oona_> I want jQuery to finish it's animation first. Now the mouse postition can give strange up and down effect.
[07:12:26] <Oona_> http://jsfiddle.net/sFAYB/
[07:14:38] <Oona_> anyone here?
[07:18:14] * hlve slaps Oona_ around a bit with a large trout
[07:18:15] <Gho5t> if you want it to complete its animation if the mouse hovers over it again, then you shouldn't be using stop
[07:18:42] <shiftingcontrol> $(".item").append(html) newly appended html content isn't rendered with site css
[07:19:30] <Gho5t> shiftingcontrol: they should be
[07:19:34] <Gho5t> debug your css
[07:19:44] <Gho5t> maybe the ancestors aren't lining up like you thought
[07:20:15] <shiftingcontrol> Gho5t, might be due to ancestors
[07:20:44] <shiftingcontrol> html content is <ul><li></li><li></li></ul> let me check
[07:21:56] <shiftingcontrol> between css from bootstrap
[07:24:29] <Oona_> ok thanks
[07:24:38] <itatitat> ey guys, Im trying to get the distance between an element and the bottom of the windows broser
[07:24:46] <itatitat> by now all my experiments were fails
[07:36:13] <wingy> what is the best way to let users upload image files with drag and drop?
[07:47:05] <BillCriswell> wingy: http://html5demos.com/dnd-upload
[07:48:50] <wingy> BillCriswell: cool thx
[07:51:08] <wingy> does html5 <input type="file" multiple> works in iOS?
[08:00:01] <qwertyuiopoiuytr> I code in javascript. I got object a that looks like {[x1,y1],[x2,y2],[]} and I want to insert *copy* of a int [] of another copy of a. How to do that *on copies* so I do not get cycle.
[08:01:02] <shoky> what?
[08:01:13] <xec_> yeah, i'm with shoky on this onw
[08:01:14] <xec_> one*
[08:01:38] <xec_> the question makes as much sense as the nick :)
[08:01:43] <shoky> hhh
[08:02:41] <qwertyuiopoiuytr>  var arrow={ 	"tail" : [0,0], 	"head" : [1,1], 	"data" : []     }
[08:02:52] <qwertyuiopoiuytr> push another arrow into "data"
[08:03:12] <shoky> arrow.data.push(anotherArrow)
[08:03:27] <qwertyuiopoiuytr> shoky: tada! we got cycle
[08:03:31] <zii> arrow.data.push(arrow)
[08:03:33] <shoky> we do?
[08:03:34] <zii> why not
[08:03:40] <shoky> also what's wrong with a cycle
[08:03:51] <qwertyuiopoiuytr> shoky: I do not need cycle
[08:04:00] <qwertyuiopoiuytr> I need copy of object
[08:04:11] <zii> qwertyuiopoiuytr, It works alright.
[08:04:17] <zii> did you try it out?
[08:04:44] <qwertyuiopoiuytr> zii: well my code results in cycle
[08:04:45] <xec_> arrow.data.push(JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(arrow))) trolol
[08:05:09] <qwertyuiopoiuytr> in one out of few insertions
[08:20:30] <qwertyuiopoiuytr> xec_ I'm impressed it works OK
[08:27:18] <nFFF> Guys jsut combined all js files on my site, and some fo code blocks at the bottom are not working, i.e. calls to methods within the end fo the file are not being recognise
[08:27:24] <nFFF> Whats the most likely cause of this?
[08:27:31] <nFFF> A missing ';' or some shit?
[08:28:16] <hlve> possibly a breaking point somewhere down the file
[08:28:56] <nFFF> how would I possibly debug this?
[08:33:32] <nFFF> any pointers
[08:33:36] <nFFF> Im new to the world of debugging
[08:34:57] <nFFF> Should I go into each file and warp it in a (function(){})(); ?
[08:35:59] <radiodario> nFFF: what's your error?
[08:36:06] <nFFF> radiodario, no error
[08:36:16] <nisseni> I want to merge an entire form with only one field from another form and post it, I can't figure out how to make the merge
[08:36:22] <radiodario> no error = no problem?
[08:36:29] <nFFF> just bottom part of file, no methods are beign recognised
[08:37:06] <nFFF> radiodario, ok specifically, where there is inline javascript calling methods that are at the bottom of a newly combined JS file of all files on server, it is getting 'no such method'
[08:39:27] <radiodario> so the methods aren't being defined?
[08:39:43] <pachet> nFFF it may be that they're being defined, just not in the scope you think they are
[08:39:57] <pachet> hence are not accessible via inline calls
[08:40:08] <pachet> hence why inline is inherently less scalable
[08:44:41] <nisseni> is there a way to merge and serialize one field from one form, and an other entire form?
[08:45:38] <BillCriswell> nisseni: You could just grab the element from the other form and append it to the one you're about to serialize then serialize it.
[08:46:18] <nisseni> BillCriswell: thanks, will try
[08:46:31] <BillCriswell> $('#form1').append($('#form2 input[name=foo]')).serialize(); etc.
[08:49:06] <Jon47> is there any reason to use either $(document).ready(function(){}); or $(function(){}); ?
[08:49:15] <Jon47> i mean, any good reason to use one over the other..
[08:49:32] <BillCriswell> Jon47: $(function(){}); is less to type... that's about it.
[08:49:49] <Jon47> BillCriswell: yeah, the only difference i can see is that one is more exprssive and one is more terse
[08:49:54] <Jon47> kind of a coin flip at that point
[08:50:18] <Jon47> i think i prefer the expressive one
[08:50:22] <pachet> $(function(){    is one function call
[08:50:28] <pachet> $(document).ready(   is two
[08:51:09] <Jon47> but what happens internally?
[08:51:10] <BillCriswell> Definitely. If you keep your scripts in the footer you can avoid it all together as well.
[08:51:26] <BillCriswell> Jon47: I think one if short for the other. I don't know enough details about it to be that helpful though.
[08:51:48] <BillCriswell> Jon47: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2662778/what-is-the-difference-between-these-jquery-ready-functions
[08:53:29] <pachet> BillCriswell++ for suggesting putting scripts at the end of the page
[08:54:30] <Jon47> yeah i prefer that of course, or even better using a dependency loader, but i'm working with some legacy stuff and can only fix so many things at once
[08:54:51] <Jon47> thanks for the input!
[08:55:04] <BillCriswell> No problem. Glad I can be helpful!
[09:04:40] <nFFF> pachet, the inline code is from isntalled modules in magento
[09:04:43] <nFFF> I didnt write it
[09:05:19] <nFFF> The wierd thing is jquery UI is the code block before the code thats not accesible
[09:05:47] <someprimetime> yo anyone here ever written a music player?
[09:06:07] <someprimetime> thinking of making one. just wondering if there are any known problems/issues i should keep in mind before i start
[09:07:01] <BillCriswell> someprimetime: I've seen this one before.. http://www.jplayer.org/
[09:08:24] <nFFF> pachet, what can I do, will wrapping the code in (function() { })();  help?
[09:08:33] <someprimetime> BillCriswell: not bad
[09:08:49] <someprimetime> i like it's cross browser/ios support too
[09:09:01] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that's pretty huge.
[09:17:29] <feyd> just looking for opinions, how do people feel about modal/lightbox scripts for image/content viewing now that 2012 is almost over?
[09:18:07] <youi> sick of em
[09:18:09] <pachet> feyd: they feel dated
[09:18:28] <pachet> i prefer the page layout to accomodate the images
[09:19:10] <feyd> agreed, now that said, what are thoughts on how to handle viewing larger image versions while keeping mobile access in mind?
[09:19:18] <pachet> nFFF: no, wrapping it all in an iife like that will almost guarantee that your functions aren't in the global scope
[09:19:33] <feyd> part of me thinks just directly linking to the image like we used to do 10 years ago is a better option than lightbox stuff
[09:20:03] <pachet> feyd: i like direct image links too!
[09:20:07] <pachet> feyd++
[09:21:31] <nFFF> pachet, almost everyone of the jQuery related files are wrapped in a self executing function
[09:21:38] <nFFF> and there mehtods are still accessible?
[09:21:53] <feyd> pachet: yeaa buddy. There's so much active development now in web, and while combining it with the huge growth in mobile, I'm stuck trying to figure out a good solution for everyone without getting convoluted with it
[09:24:22] <slick-> if i have something like
[09:24:23] <slick-> <a href="#" class="pdf" id="pdf" style="margin-right:5px;">Download The Floor Plan PDF</a>
[09:24:35] <slick-> will this update the URL of the id: $("pdf").attr("href", "http://www.google.com/")
[09:25:04] <feyd> slick-: change it to $("#pdf") to get the right selector
[09:25:12] <slick-> ohhhhh
[09:25:13] <slick-> thats
[09:25:14] <slick-> what it was
[09:25:15] <slick-> thx bro
[09:25:20] <fruitFly> :D
[09:26:04] <feyd> tom BROoaw
[09:26:14] <pachet> nFFF because they deliberately expose them
[09:26:20] <feyd> oops, well i blew it
[09:26:37] <fruitFly> why do you guys like web dev?
[09:26:51] <feyd> in general?
[09:26:55] <fruitFly> yes
[09:27:13] <feyd> job security, also me surfing the internet can be counted as 'research'
[09:27:22] <fruitFly> lol
[09:27:34] <fruitFly> what type of job do you have?
[09:28:14] <feyd> but seriously, it's a quickly developing field that's really interesting and is the gateway to presenting what will continue to be the largest source of information in the world
[09:28:33] <pachet> fruitFly: i like it because it's an endless string of complex problems to solve
[09:28:36] <feyd> fruitFly: I'm a dev at a small company, I do VB.NET programming and front end development
[09:28:59] <pachet> and you get to make very pointed structural decisions that affect the health of your codebase
[09:29:04] <pachet> it's like growing a garden
[09:29:13] <pachet> except air conditioned
[09:29:33] <fruitFly> I'm also interested in back end development and want to learn functional programming; if one wanted to be top tier in wed dev would that be a full time job.. I'm guessing so?
[09:29:46] <pachet> wednesday development?
[09:29:46] <feyd> nothing more satisfying than having an organized file structure and neatly organized code inside
[09:30:09] <pachet> feyd: our little way of combatting the law of entropy :]
[09:30:45] <feyd> fruitFly: it depends on what you're doing, but there are dozens of jobs that are definitely full time that don't involve programming
[09:31:36] <Cameron_> what type of an array is this?
[09:31:37] <Cameron_> data: {	prevData: window.data, newAddress: $('#address2').val() }
[09:31:46] <pachet> the kind that's not
[09:31:49] <pachet> it's an object
[09:32:05] <Cameron_> ok
[09:32:07] <Cameron_> thanks
[09:32:24] <Jagst3r15> hey can someone help me with this, I have this mobile menu I just added but for some reason the dropdowns are not showing even though they should http://jagst3r15.com/ (resize to like 768px)
[09:34:29] <pachet> nFFF: if you look at the jq source, for instance, they use that pattern ('(function ( ) { -->') but notice they pass in 'window' as the first argument
[09:34:51] <pachet> nFFF: which allows them to set certain properties on window, which is synonymous with the global in the case of browsers
[09:37:18] <nFFF> ok thanks
[09:37:23] <feyd> Jagst3r15: well you are correct in identifying the culprit as the jquery portion of small-menu.js
[09:37:25] <nFFF> Ive un-combined the files for now
[09:37:33] <nFFF> Ill have to have a look at the files individually
[09:37:59] <feyd> Jagst3r15: manually applying the 'visible' class to #menu-primary .menu has the drop down show up
[09:39:17] <Jagst3r15> so the problem is this? 		  $j( '#menu-primary .menu' ).toggleClass( 'visible' );  feyd?
[09:41:56] <feyd> Jagst3r15: I lied, that code is all fine
[09:42:21] <Jagst3r15> it something with the css I had a suspicion
[09:42:28] <Jagst3r15> but was seeing if it was jq first
[09:43:02] <feyd> Jagst3r15: its javascript that's causing your problem, just not the jquery bit of it
[09:43:17] <Jagst3r15> oh ok
[09:43:41] <feyd> what browser are you using?
[09:44:35] <Jagst3r15> google chrome latest stable version
[09:45:44] <feyd> open up your developer tools and check out your errors in console
[09:45:54] <Jagst3r15> k
[09:46:15] <Jagst3r15> no errors reported
[09:46:47] <feyd> I see two
[09:47:31] <Jagst3r15> hmm
[09:48:22] <feyd> Jagst3r15: comment out wpgroho.js from your page source, and that inline script it's referencing in the error console, then see if your menu works
[09:48:27] <Jagst3r15> sorry not trying to get u to do work for me
[09:48:31] <feyd> I know
[09:48:38] <Jagst3r15> i literally dont see errors maybe browser is busted :P
[09:48:50] <Jagst3r15> oki
[09:50:36] <Jagst3r15> no luck
[09:50:41] <RafaJaques> anyone ever had to do some conference grid allocation?
[09:54:47] <ansolas> why is data undefined on that custom event : http://jsfiddle.net/daslicht/TW3uN/
[09:54:50] <ansolas> any idea
[09:54:50] <ansolas> ?
[09:55:38] <dabear> ansolas: yep
[09:55:40] <shoky> ansolas: you're not passing that event object anywhere
[09:55:43] <dabear> you're doing it wrong
[09:55:47] <shoky> er
[09:55:52] <Gho5t> if a function were defined as $.fn.updateValue, shouldn't I be able to call it by doing $.updateValue() ?
[09:56:08] <dabear> Gho5t: no
[09:56:58] <Gho5t> so if I have to do $.fn.updateValue() why is it when you define a plugin such as  $.fn.customWidget, you call it by doing $('.foo').customWidget() ?
[09:58:22] <shoky> ansolas- http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TW3uN/8/
[09:58:23] <dabear> Gho5t: $.fn is the same as $.prototype
[09:58:40] <Gho5t> yeah
[09:58:50] <Gho5t> still kinda confused why doing $.somePrototype method doesn't work
[09:59:00] <Gho5t> still kinda confused why doing $.somePrototypeFunction doesn't work
[09:59:03] <dabear> jquery objects "inherit" from the prototype
[09:59:46] <ansolas> @shoky: yeah i know that solution but wouldnt it be nice to use the data property of the event object itself !?
[09:59:58] <ansolas> its still undefined in your example :)
[10:00:57] <shoky> ansolas: no its not..
[10:01:16] <shoky> ansolas: event.data is used when you pass data when binding, not when triggering. see http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/TW3uN/9/
[10:01:37] <dabear> Gho5t: if you do $("foo") or jQuery("foo") you get an object that get's its methods from jQuery.prototype/jQuery.fn/$.fn/$.prototype ( all the same)
[10:01:39] <ansolas> ahh ok so I am forced to pass a second paramenter
[10:02:15] <shoky> yes it's horrible..
[10:02:46] <Gho5t> dabear: yes I get that. I just don't get why you have to specify $.prototype.someNewFunction() when $.someNewFunction() should be visible to prototypical inheritance
[10:02:49] <Gho5t> i would think
[10:03:24] <dabear> no, because $ is only an object
[10:03:27] <shoky> they don't inherit from $
[10:03:30] <dabear> or, a function, rather
[10:03:41] <dabear> you don't inherit from objects
[10:03:48] <dabear> you inherit from their prototypes
[10:04:01] <shoky> (which are objects ;p)
[10:04:20] <Jagst3r15> feyd this is odd lol
[10:04:22] <ansolas> @shoky, ahh thanks now i get it !
[10:04:51] <Gho5t> $ is an object with a prototype of $.prototype  no?
[10:04:58] <Gho5t> all object have prototypes
[10:05:14] <shoky> $ is firsly a function
[10:05:16] <shoky> firstly
[10:06:56] <Gho5t> if a jquery plugin can be attached by doing $('.foo').customWidget() isn't that stating that $ has the same protototype as $.prototype?
[10:07:36] <scar> anyone know how to get the nivo slider nav controls to stay visible?
[10:12:22] <shoky> Gho5t: donno what you mean. how is that stating anything like what you said
[10:12:50] <shoky> an object's prototype is not its .prototype property
[10:13:02] <Gho5t> shoky: you create a widget by adding it to the jQuery prototype e.g. $.fn.customWidget = function() { ...
[10:13:22] <shoky> the .prototype property is a property of functions, namely constructor functions that are used to create new objects which extend whatever the .prototype of the function is
[10:14:26] <shoky> Gho5t: that's not creating a widget. that is adding a function to jQuery.prototype  (which all jq objects extend)
[10:14:32] <Jagst3r15> feyd i got it
[10:14:39] <Gho5t> that's how you create a plugin
[10:14:43] <Gho5t> that is the pattern
[10:14:48] <shoky> a plugin is a function, sure
[10:14:55] <Jagst3r15> was just some css, had to add 	.sub-menu {  display: block !important;  visibility: visible !important; }
[10:15:29] <xec> Gho5t: not if you want it attached directly to $.myPlugin() -- then you'd do $.myPlugin = function(){...}
[10:15:49] <shoky> that's just using the $ function as a namespace
[10:15:58] <xec> indeed
[10:16:01] <shoky> no prototypes or inheritance involved
[10:16:25] <Gho5t> ok
[10:16:31] <Gho5t> so 2 ways to do it gotcha
[10:16:35] <Gho5t> now one last thing
[10:16:40] <shoky> not 2 ways
[10:16:44] <shoky> 2 ways to get totally different results
[10:16:59] <shoky> you choose the way which fits what you wanna do
[10:17:04] <Gho5t> k
[10:17:16] <Gho5t> now you said a prototype is a constructor function
[10:17:29] <shoky> no i didn't
[10:17:31] <Gho5t> which would imply adding properties/functions after initialization would not trickle down
[10:17:39] <Gho5t> to objects already initialized, no?
[10:18:00] <shoky> adding properties to what?
[10:18:15] <Gho5t> an object
[10:18:19] <Gho5t> such as String
[10:18:21] <Gho5t> whatever
[10:18:36] <shoky> uh can you rephrase
[10:18:50] <Gho5t> ...
[10:19:18] <shoky> adding properties to $.fn  would "trickle down" to any jquery objects, at any time
[10:19:22] <Gho5t> if object a has a prototype of Foo, are you saying that adding a function to Foo after object a was already initialized would not add the function to a
[10:19:49] <imsky> Gho5t: lol wut
[10:20:14] <Gho5t> imsky: do you understand prototypical inheritance?
[10:20:16] <Gho5t> probably not
[10:20:22] <imsky> yeah pretty sure i do
[10:20:24] <Gho5t> so don't try and pile on
[10:20:27] <imsky> do you even know who i am
[10:20:40] <Gho5t> not really interested
[10:20:46] <dabear> Gho5t: if you add String.bar = function(){} any strings would NOT get a bar method
[10:20:48] <imsky> then why did you decide that i dont understand inheritance
[10:20:57] <dabear> if you add to String.prototype, they will
[10:21:01] <Zzaichik> are you….  my mom?
[10:21:07] <imsky> i'm your mom Zzaichik
[10:21:14] <Zzaichik> I knew it!
[10:21:20] <imsky> my lil bunny rabbit
[10:21:22] <Gho5t> dabear: right. I guess I misunderstood Shoky but he did say the prototype was simply a constructor function
[10:21:26] <Gho5t> at least it sounded like it
[10:21:29] <dabear> no, I'm your mom
[10:21:32] <imsky> IM YOUR MOM
[10:21:33] <shoky>  <shoky> no i didn't
[10:21:51] <imsky> shoky i think you're dealing with a moderately unintelligent person here
[10:21:52] <dabear> imsky: im also ur mom
[10:21:57] <imsky> dabear but im ur dad
[10:22:09] <dabear> imsky: I wish
[10:22:16] <imsky> our family is a mess
[10:22:16] <shoky> i said functions have a 'prototype' property. it's just an object
[10:22:17] <Gho5t> <shoky>: the .prototype property is a property of functions, namely constructor functions that are used to create new objects which extend whatever the .prototype of the function is
[10:22:25] <cbix> Does anyone know a fast/performant full-width banner/teaser slider plugin for jquery?
[10:22:32] <BillCriswell> I don't understand any programming speak until I actually program and I do things I say I don't understand accidentally.
[10:22:34] <shoky> Gho5t: the 'namely' refers to the functions, not to the prototype property
[10:22:40] <Gho5t> imsky: aren't you the noob getting schooled in #javascript
[10:22:45] <imsky> by whom
[10:22:46] <imsky> and in what
[10:22:50] <imsky> can you even read
[10:22:59] <Gho5t> BennyLava
[10:23:01] <Gho5t> no I can't
[10:23:07] <Gho5t> thannks for bringing that up
[10:23:09] <imsky> i'm getting schooled by riven? doubt it
[10:23:23] <imsky> the guy's site has been stuck in 2009 for a while now
[10:23:24] <imsky> lol
[10:23:34] <Gho5t> good one
[10:23:45] <imsky> thanks mate
[10:23:47] <imsky> i did it for you
[10:23:53] <Gho5t> another good one
[10:23:56] <Gho5t> top knotch stuff
[10:23:59] <Gho5t> chap
[10:24:02] <imsky> wow stop talking
[10:24:07] <Gho5t> nice
[10:24:22] <xec> Gho5t: keep it on topic please
[10:24:28] <Gho5t> yep
[10:25:49] <imsky> cbix what have you considered
[10:30:00] <cbix> imsky: I'm looking for a plugin
[10:30:42] <imsky> ok
[10:31:48] <Chillance> ok, so $(this).closest("table").fadeOut(); works for me...but, how do I make this work? $(this).closest("table > tbody > tr").removeClass("odd even"); ?
[10:32:23] <BillCriswell> cbix: http://www.iosscripts.com/iosslider/ is snazzy, http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/ is as well
[10:33:35] <cbix> thanks BillCriswell
[10:33:47] <Chillance> ah.. I might have it
[10:35:19] <pachet> Chillance : eh i'd just use $(this).closest('table').find('tr') -->
[10:36:39] <Chillance> yea
[10:50:42] <scar> dargh i feel stupid. its css3 not js showing/hiding the arrows in nivo =P just read the changelog
[10:58:38] <aram535> Hi.  I have a fairly complex html page that I need to turn into a huge jquery dynamically generated code.  Is there an online tool that can turn the html body into a bunch of ".add()"?
[10:58:47] <imsky> dont do that
[10:59:42] <aram535> imsky: you talking to me?
[11:00:17] <imsky> yes
[11:01:55] <ansolas> anyone using iScroll in here?
[11:02:08] <venus_> hello does anyone know of the background position plugin i am trying to move and image as the user scrolls down the page
[11:02:39] <venus_> http://pastebin.com/xeUxtV5u this is the code i am using
[11:07:49] <Bish> could someone lead me into the right direction if i want to draw an overlay with a window? is it like adding a div to body which is floating and width,height @ 100 % ?
[11:07:59] <imsky> yep
[11:08:14] <Bish> the floating is the magic trick?
[11:08:20] <imsky> z-index
[11:08:23] <imsky> no magic
[11:08:34] <Bish> so i can do it without float: ?
[11:08:53] <imsky> yeah you SHOULD do it without float
[11:09:08] <Eviltwin> position: absolute or something
[11:10:21] <venus_> did anyone see my question
[11:10:39] <irishguy> Hi folks.
[11:12:53] <BillCriswell> venus_: I believe you're looking for Parallax.
[11:12:59] <BillCriswell> http://dev.jonraasch.com/scrolling-parallax/examples/scrolling-parallax quick example.
[11:14:36] <Bish> when im scrolling, than that overlay won't size itself, how can i change that?
[11:15:22] <irishguy> I've been testing some x-domain requests using JSONP, which requires a cookie to be sent with the request. The only way I've managed to get IE to allow the cookie to be read is to add a P3P header to the page setting the cookie. Was wondering if this is an acceptable approach or if there is a better way of addressing this?
[11:18:36] <ak> hm good question
[11:23:28] <venus_> ak what
[11:27:46] <Bish> .css({"height":$(window).height()+"px","width":"100%"}) why does this not work?
[11:28:09] <Zzaichik> eww
[11:28:17] <Bish> ugly :D?
[11:28:43] <Bish> is there a better way?
[11:29:17] <imsky> yes
[11:29:42] <ak> hm
[11:30:03] <ak> Bish: that should work
[11:30:05] <Bish> im0b, would you be so kind to tell me?
[11:30:13] <Bish> it doesn't qq
[11:30:20] <ak> ?demo @ Bish
[11:30:26] <ak> hm
[11:30:28] <imsky> lol
[11:30:29] <ak> :D
[11:30:35] <imsky> bots hatin
[11:30:42] <ak> yeah
[11:30:50] <ak> Bish: make an example of this on jsfiddle
[11:30:58] <ak> and we can take a look maybe
[11:31:03] <imsky> it's probably on an already-created site ak
[11:34:16] <dogarrhea2> I have an "architecture" i'm dealing with as follows:  a message server which stores messages.  two clients who communicate via this messaging server.  One uses a flash based client, and the other is web based.  How would one push a message from the message server to the web client assuming the flash based client sends a message to the message server
[11:35:39] <imsky> none of that involves jquery
[11:36:01] <dogarrhea2> i am thinking that the client just keeps ajaxing new requests a few times a second, but it seems very expensive
[11:36:17] <Bish> works in jsfiddle ofc
[11:36:22] <imsky> ofs
[11:36:30] <dogarrhea2> don't be too quick to dismiss, since you probably might be wrong about some implementations
[11:36:52] <imsky> lol all day on irc people who dont know me keep telling me i dont know what their problem is
[11:37:03] <dogarrhea2> jsfiddle gets updates from server with page refresh. i'm talking dynamic dom here
[11:37:36] <dogarrhea2> so there is no persistent connection that can be opened via ajax
[11:37:58] <dogarrhea2> and no event listener that can listen for some server event without actually polling the server
[11:38:06] <dogarrhea2> Is that right?
[11:39:05] <NoiseEee> http://socket.io/ @ dogarrhea2
[11:40:01] <dogarrhea2> NoiseEee: is it just wrapping polling up in a nice syntax or is it actually keeping something open
[11:41:03] <NoiseEee> you can set up Node on your backend to send an event to the browser when something happens.
[11:41:24] <NoiseEee> it uses fallbacks.  ideally websockets, then flash (i think), polling, etc
[11:43:04] <Bish> well putting the div to $(window).height() is equal to putting it to 100 %
[11:43:16] <dogarrhea2> websocket is this "new" standard right?
[11:43:17] <Bish> how can i get the "size" of the whole page, not the visible stuff?
[11:44:08] <irishguy> Bish: Get the computed height of a containing element for the whole page content?
[11:44:33] <Bish> $(document).height() seems to work, too, but if the document rezises im fucked, right?
[11:44:34] <gkatsev> how can I get the responseXML from the success handler of $.ajax? Do you need a reference to the jqXHR object?
[11:44:52] <dogarrhea2> ok sounds like i need comet
[11:45:03] <dogarrhea2> imsky isn't that a jquery plugin...
[11:45:08] <dogarrhea2> "none of that involves jquery"
[11:45:12] <imsky> what
[11:45:41] <irishguy> Bish: Listen for the resize event perhaps?
[11:45:55] <Bish> of document? for an overlay? that sucks.
[11:46:14] <dogarrhea2> it probably passed your mind imsky. it's ok google helped me
[11:46:37] <Bish> can i disable scrolling instead?
[11:46:54] <Bish> or hide body, and redisplay it?
[11:47:29] <irishguy> Bish: Depends what you mean, you can kill the overflow-y, which removes scrollbars. Or you can used position: fixed on the overlay?
[11:50:01] <Bish> irishguy, thanks, cool
[11:50:52] <irishguy> Is it ok to repeat a question here, or do folk rage about that?
[11:51:12] <Bish> how comes that the overlay's background-color isn't white?
[11:51:27] <Bish> irishguy, do it, i will give you backup!
[11:59:50] <kanishka> whats the difference between translate3d and animate
[12:02:06] <Bish> hm if i remove stuff with .remove() it appears to come back, if i put it's fatherelement back
[12:04:57] <Zzaichik> How are you adding the parent element back in?
[12:07:06] <Bish> well. i add the overlay to body, works fine, add a window to it, delete the window with window.remove(); and then remove the overlay itself
[12:07:17] <Bish> when im putting the overlay back in, and add a window, there are 2 of them
[12:08:23] <Bish> tried it with .empy() and works.
[12:08:34] <d4sh> hey guys, i'm trying to destroy a jqueryui element but i'm having some difficulty, anyone know how to do this? the added div is screwing up the formatting of my page when i just use the disable option
[12:08:40] <d4sh> i'm using jqueryiui resizable
[12:08:51] <Zzaichik> Bish: Well good, glad I could help. ;p
[12:09:09] <Bish> yay im drawing windows
[12:09:10] <Bish> !
[12:09:11] <d4sh> is there a .destroy() option? or am i going to have to manually .remove() the div elements
[12:09:28] <Zzaichik> oh, Bish - this might be helpful.  http://jsfiddle.net/4RVRC/2/
[12:09:38] <Zzaichik> maybe not. whatever...
[12:09:46] <Bish> i just fought with that problem but thanks!
[12:10:15] <Zzaichik> so like 20 minutes ago it would have been helpful. awesome. haha
[12:11:48] <Bish> Zzaichik, yah :D
[12:18:09] <zzing> What is the name of the $('div…')  functionality so I can look up properties and such?
[12:18:34] <Trisox> ?
[12:19:18] <zzing> When id o something like      $('div#bigdisplay').height($(window).height() - $('header#header').height());     what is the name of the $() function or whatever it is called
[12:20:42] <rakm> How do you check if a particular element has a class? I've tried .is() and.hasClass()
[12:21:14] <NoiseEee> rakm: .hasClass
[12:21:23] <Trisox> $('.test').length
[12:21:30] <imsky> lol no
[12:21:35] <Trisox> hasclass :) indeed
[12:21:36] <imsky> hasClass rakm
[12:21:49] <rakm> that's what I thought. But…. TypeError: Object #<HTMLDivElement> has no method 'hasClass'
[12:22:05] <imsky> no prob
[12:22:09] <imsky> just wrap obj in $()
[12:22:09] <rakm> jquery 1.8
[12:22:12] <imsky> to get $(obj)
[12:23:20] <rakm> huh, I had to do this
[12:23:20] <rakm> $($('.pb_container')[0]).hasClass('.pb_container')
[12:23:29] <imsky> lol
[12:23:48] <imsky> that's a funny piece of code
[12:24:12] <rakm> for the giggles
[12:24:26] <imsky> yeah no
[12:24:34] <imsky> why would you ever expect that to be false
[12:25:14] <Trisox> :| well if it doesnt have that class
[12:25:16] <Trisox> else not
[12:25:18] <imsky> wat
[12:25:18] <b-ot> We automated a site recently and several jquery's came to using a core engine of jquery 1.3.2
[12:25:36] <imsky> $(".test").hasClass("test")
[12:25:51] <imsky> profound piece of jquery there
[12:25:58] <Trisox> :p
[12:26:15] <rakm> :P does the element truly know itself?
[12:26:16] <DaSpawn> Hi, I am currently using Easy Tooltip to add simple tooltips based on element tile, but how can I remove a tooltip once it is set?   I am disabling a field, setting a tooltip why it is disabled, and when re-enabled I want to remove the tooltime
[12:26:22] <imsky> for sure rakm
[12:27:15] <rakm> fyi was just trying to make it work with something that should obviously return true. Was forgetting the wrapper $()
[12:27:57] <Genscher> Hey, is there a way to get autocompletion in Eclipse with jQuery? Or should I better switch to another IDE?
[12:28:13] <rebekah> Hi
[12:28:15] <imsky> genscher there's probably a way, but komodo edit already does autocomplete
[12:28:26] <rebekah> I was on here a few days ago.
[12:28:27] <Trisox> phpstorm!
[12:28:40] <Trisox> sublimetext 2
[12:28:56] <Trisox> phpstorm got autocomplete out of the box
[12:29:03] <DaSpawn> how do I remove the extended attributes/options from an element?
[12:29:04] <Trisox> and sublimetext 2 with plugin
[12:29:10] <rebekah> I was hoping to find someone that knew about testing jQuery with jasmine-rails.
[12:30:08] <Genscher> imsky, Trisox: thanks, will google :)
[12:30:15] <imsky> yw
[12:30:15] <Trisox> DaSpawn: extended attributes ?
[12:30:44] <rebekah> And I really couldn't give enough information in this environment, so I posted a stackoverflow question with more details.  If anyone is willing to give it a look,  I would really apreciatte it! http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12358051/why-is-the-jquery-code-not-executing-or-at-least-not-appearing-to-execute-in-m
[12:30:45] <DaSpawn> trying to remove a tooltip once it has been set
[12:31:16] <DaSpawn> $.fn.easyTooltip = function(options){ ....  var options = $.extend(defaults, options);
[12:31:28] <DaSpawn> I may not be using correct language
[12:31:33] <Trisox> unbind?
[12:32:12] <Trisox> destroy
[12:32:17] <DaSpawn> how would that fit if I am setting it by:  $('#hoodvent2').attr('title',"Not available with selected rating");     $('#hoodvent2').easyTooltip();
[12:32:47] <Trisox> destroy lol :S
[12:33:06] <DaSpawn> ('#hoodvent2').destroy?
[12:33:25] <Trisox> .unbind
[12:33:33] <Trisox> prob would work
[12:33:38] <Trisox> ?unbind
[12:33:39] <bot-t> .unbind([eventType], [handler]): Remove a previously-attached event handler from the elements. http://api.jquery.com/unbind/
[12:34:39] <DaSpawn> ah, learn something new every day, thank you much for help this worked: $('#hoodvent2').unbind();
[12:34:40] <Trisox> try $('#hoodvent2').unbind()
[12:34:45] <DaSpawn> :)
[12:34:47] <Trisox> :)
[12:34:59] <Trisox> removes event handlers
[12:35:56] <DaSpawn> oops, need to reattach the ones I want, any way to selectively unbind or just easier to re-adttach
[12:36:07] <DaSpawn> (I have click and hover actions)
[12:37:01] <Bish> how can i add a close button to an overlay popup at the uppre right? tutorials say position aboslute and right:-15px and left:-15px doesn't work for me
[12:42:33] <wachpwnski> anyone use nanoscroller?
[12:42:49] <wachpwnski> Or have a suggestion for a good content scroller?
[12:51:25] <mbn_18> Hi, Just noticed Jquery UI Autocomplete breakes with Jquery 1.8.1
[12:51:51] <mbn_18> After upgrading from 1.7.2
[12:52:17] <mbn_18> Does any one know of a bug or solution to this problem?
[12:55:28] <ak> mbn_18: i think you should stick with jquery 1.7.2 for now for jquery ui
[12:55:33] <eph3meral> where can I read about this syntax $('<span/>',{"foo":"bar"})
[12:56:08] <mbn_18> ak: Yea, might be the best solution. will post a bug
[12:56:17] <gnarf> mbn_18: what version of UI?
[12:56:31] <gnarf> mbn_18: if you haven't updated UI - there are breaks
[12:56:42] <gnarf> i thikn 1.8.23 is the lowest version compatible with 1.8
[12:57:02] <mbn_18> gnarf: I use 1.8.21
[12:57:07] <gnarf> mbn_18: update UI
[12:57:18] <gnarf> and it should work fine with 1.8.1 core
[12:57:39] <cilaes> I threw some simple jquery into a page that .hide()'s and then .delays()'s a few fadeIn()'s, and it works, but disables selection of any text on the page, and I cannot for the life of me get .click to work. I've tried calling 'click' through .live() too... Any suggestions? http://pastebin.com/fJuk693L
[12:57:54] <mbn_18> gnarf: Will do though their web site state that 1.8.x is for jquery 1.3.2 and up
[12:58:12] <gnarf> mbn_18: "their web site" - I'm on the UI team
[12:58:35] <gnarf> the latest stable is compatible with those versions
[12:58:49] <Trisox> lol
[12:58:53] <gnarf> there were bugs in UI that we fixed in 1.8.23 (i think)
[12:59:25] <gnarf> its hard to "support a version" that wasn't released when you released the code :)
[12:59:51] <mbn_18> gnarf: Well, you can state that it was tested up to 1.7.x
[13:00:03] <zzing> What is the jquery equivalent of appendChild?
[13:00:10] <mbn_18> gnarf: never mind. going to check if .23 will work
[13:00:19] <gnarf> mbn_18: every version was tested on every stable version of the jQuery core library that was released at the time it was
[13:00:44] <bjensen> Sometimes my clients call me and I would like to know their browser. My plan is to have them enter a key combo and an alert will appear with the browser and its version. My initial thought was to use http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/ but it is deprecated. Any advice as what I should use instead?
[13:01:21] <Trisox> cilaes:
[13:02:30] <Trisox> wy use  hide at first
[13:02:38] <Trisox> use css and display none ;)
[13:03:31] <Trisox> you dont show #standout
[13:04:15] <gnarf> bjensen: http://jsfiddle.net/eYrU8/
[13:05:15] <Trisox> cilaes: http://jsfiddle.net/jDfXh/
[13:05:19] <Trisox> someting like that?
[13:05:22] <bjensen> gnarf: right…but how do I that in my own js?
[13:05:33] <bjensen> gnarf: I don't like to depend on a third party..
[13:05:47] <gnarf> bjensen: the nice thing about using browserscope is that it is maintained by the community
[13:05:57] <Trisox> ?$.browser
[13:05:59] <bot-t> Trisox, jQuery.browser - We recommend against using this property; please try to use feature detection instead (see jQuery.support). jQuery.browser will be moved to a plugin in a future release of jQuery. Contains flags fo... http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.browser/
[13:06:06] <Trisox> oh :D
[13:06:25] <gnarf> its also apache licensed --- feel free to look at the source
[13:06:27] <bjensen> gnarf: well for example. I need to display the msg in danish..
[13:06:52] <gnarf> UA detection is not an easy game
[13:06:58] <Trisox> true
[13:07:13] <bjensen> gnarf: well its just for IE, Chrome and FF
[13:07:36] <bjensen> the jquery browser works fine in my tests..its just deprecated
[13:07:53] <gnarf> bjensen: its deprecated because we plan on removing it
[13:08:00] <gnarf> there is nothing stopping you from copying it and using it
[13:08:30] <bjensen> gnarf: true, I suppose I was hoping there was a plugin already for this
[13:08:33] <gnarf> we feel that ua sniffing / browser testing is bad practice
[13:08:39] <gnarf> there is
[13:08:42] <gnarf> its just already in core
[13:08:44] <gnarf> copy the code
[13:08:50] <gnarf> once we pull it out
[13:09:11] <gnarf> we will probably turn it into a plugin for all those people that really seem to want this feature
[13:10:40] <Trisox> BrowserDetect.browser BrowserDetect.version
[13:11:03] <Trisox> http://www.quirksmode.org/js/detect.html
[13:11:15] <Trisox> might be usefull ;)
[13:11:22] <cilaes> trisox: Thanks... but, the "lights out" effect works by itself.. It's just that since I added those 4 delays, the whole page acts screwy. No cursor changes, no selectable text, and the click doesn't get called at all.
[13:12:18] <Trisox> well animate is tricky :)
[13:15:02] <cilaes> I wish .show() worked with .delay
[13:15:35] <Trisox> timeout ?
[13:16:31] <Trisox> use css3 for animations and fallback for js ;)
[13:24:15] <Bish> how do i do position if i have multilanguage support
[13:24:37] <Bish> for example, if i have a button at the upper right which says "close" if i do that in german it would be "schliessen" since that is longer, it will overflow the div
[13:25:50] <Trisox> thats more a css question
[13:26:14] <Trisox> width:auto;
[13:26:31] <Trisox> right:0; top:0;
[13:26:42] <Trisox> or something depends on the layout css page html etc
[13:30:36] <Bish> Trisox, how would i get something in the right upper corner of a div anyways -_-
[13:31:47] <Trisox> :D
[13:32:02] <Bish> is it this difficult or am i stupid?
[13:32:22] <callumacrae> You're certainly in the wrong channel1 xD
[13:33:04] <Bish> well you could use jquery to do that.
[13:33:42] <Trisox> Bish: http://jsfiddle.net/8LvMt/
[13:33:52] <Trisox> just css...
[13:34:26] <Bish> wtf, that never worked for me i dont get that actually
[13:34:28] <Trisox> http://jsfiddle.net/8LvMt/1/
[13:34:38] <Trisox> check
[13:34:52] <Trisox> position absolute is important on parent
[13:34:59] <callumacrae> Bish: You shouldn't use jQuery for basic styling, it isn't what JavaScript was designed for, and quite a lot of people still have it disabled
[13:35:01] <Trisox> but this is still css
[13:35:40] <Bish> if i do that it put's the "button" in upper right corner of the document, not of the div, why the fuck is that?
[13:35:45] <Bish> i was always confused about that
[13:36:13] <Trisox> position absolute on your wrapped element
[13:36:24] <Trisox> like in the example
[13:36:39] <Bish> yeah, well... what the fuck
[13:36:44] <Trisox> :D
[13:36:57] <Trisox> there also underaged kids here plzz... mark your words
[13:37:06] <Bish> will do...
[13:37:10] <Trisox> :)
[13:37:14] <Trisox> thank you
[13:38:34] <venus_> hello how can i change background position on page scroll
[13:38:38] <wachpwnski> can you do a selection by a custom attirbute. Like instead of class="myclass" or id="myid" you can do custom="myvalue"  and select by custom that is = myvalue?
[13:38:41] <Trisox> ò_ó
[13:39:04] <Bish> nyancat: scroll version
[13:39:14] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski: yes, but you should really be using "data-customAttributeName="value"'
[13:39:16] <Trisox> .css('backgroundPosition','yourpx')
[13:39:29] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski: $('[data-somethingOrOther="145"]')
[13:39:34] <Trisox> wachpwnski: use data-roll=""
[13:39:38] <Trisox> html5
[13:39:46] <Trisox> data-lalallalala=""
[13:39:50] <LakWork_> how do i handle this closure problem...
[13:39:53] <LakWork_> for (var i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
[13:39:53] <LakWork_> 	var img = '#img' + i;
[13:39:53] <LakWork_> 	var overlay = '#image-overlay-' + i;
[13:39:53] <LakWork_> 	$(img).on('mouseenter', function (ev) {
[13:39:53] <LakWork_> 		 $overlay.show();
[13:39:53] <LakWork_> 	});
[13:39:54] <LakWork_> }
[13:40:01] <Trisox> plzz use jsfiddle.net
[13:40:05] <LakWork_> sorry one sec
[13:40:07] <NoiseEee> LakWork_: by not pasting it in channgel.
[13:40:17] <Trisox> :)
[13:40:25] <NoiseEee> LakWork_: http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62
[13:40:29] <LakWork_> by not pasting it in channgel.
[13:40:29] <LakWork_> [13:40] <Trisox> :)
[13:42:50] <Bish> http://jsfiddle.net/uyB4L/ why does never work for me? is it because the father div is usually not absolutely positioned?
[13:43:07] <wachpwnski> NoiseEee:  how do I select it now?
[13:44:08] <NoiseEee> wachpwnski: $('[data-somethingOrOther="145"]')
[13:44:15] <Trisox> Bish: YOU GOT BOTTOM NOT TOP
[13:44:26] <wachpwnski> cool, thanks, sorry, missed that
[13:44:27] <Trisox> sorry for caps
[13:44:30] <Trisox> :|
[13:44:38] <therealkoopa> Is there anyway to catch when an element height/width changes? Basically a $(window).resize(function () {}) but on a per-element basis?
[13:44:41] <Bish> no, that's not the problem dude :D that experiment was fine, i'm wondering why it's not working when im using it elsewhere
[13:44:59] <Trisox> no idea :)
[13:45:02] <Bish> if i do exactly that in my pages, it will be positioned at bottom right of the PAGE, not of the div
[13:45:41] <Trisox> like i said your "#content" doesnt have position absolute
[13:45:45] <Trisox> in your page
[13:45:55] <LakWork_> NoiseEee that worked well enough, although the syntax is ugly as hell!
[13:45:57] <LakWork_> thank you!
[13:46:07] <Trisox> ?.data
[13:46:07] <bot-t> .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:46:11] <Bish> Trisox, and how do i position stuff in the middle, when using position:absolute ?
[13:47:27] <shoky> position:relative is fine too
[13:47:34] <shoky> as long as its positioned
[13:47:48] <Bish> and how do i place a button in the upper right when doing that ^_^
[13:48:14] <shoky> wat
[13:48:14] <b-ot> Even before this, you are actually going to use that anyone would want to make more?
[13:48:50] <Trisox> Bish: use margin:0 auto; on a relative wrapper
[13:49:09] <Bish> there's something about that.. which i don't get
[13:49:16] <Trisox> :D
[13:49:31] <Trisox> 0 top and bottom auto left and right
[13:49:52] <Trisox> relative position from body...
[13:49:55] <Trisox> or something else
[13:49:57] <Bish> if i have a div in the middle of that page.. with margin:auto.. how can i put something in upper right corner of it?
[13:50:12] <Bish> it works, as it seems, with absolute positioning..
[13:50:34] <Trisox> wrapper or float
[13:50:43] <Trisox> try #css
[13:50:47] <Trisox> this is for jquery
[13:50:49] <shoky> position:absolute,top:0,right:0
[13:50:50] <Bish> okay, thank you very much
[13:51:03] <Bish> shoky, that will place it in upper right corner of the document, not of the div
[13:51:05] <Trisox> shoky: i showed that already in a fiddle
[13:51:09] <shoky> Bish: not true
[13:51:15] <Trisox> its true shoky
[13:51:17] <Bish> shoky, than why does it?
[13:51:27] <Bish> then*
[13:51:30] <shoky> it will place it in the top right corner if that element's offset parent
[13:51:36] <Bish> doesn't matter Trisox is right, this is jquery
[13:51:41] <Bish> not sparta
[13:51:43] <Trisox> shoky: if that element is absolute
[13:51:51] <shoky> the offset parent being the closest ancestor that is positioned, i.e. has position other than default 'static'
[13:52:30] <shoky> position:absolute actually means its relative :P
[13:52:56] <Bish> i could switch the father element positioning to absolute .. if i knew how to put it in the middle then ;) than i wouldn't have a problem
[13:52:57] <Trisox> now back to jquery
[13:53:02] <shoky> er and before i meant 'of' not 'if' :\
[13:53:04] <Trisox> i want to see $$$$$$ dolars
[13:53:12] <shoky> 'of that element's offsedt parent'
[13:53:13] <Trisox> :D
[13:53:20] <Bish> $('*').css(insert css discussion)
[13:53:31] <Trisox> no no ;)
[13:53:33] <shoky> Bish: you dont have to switch to absolute
[13:53:40] <shoky> Bish: switching to relative is fine too
[13:53:43] <Bish> shoky, allow me to query
[13:54:05] <Bish> if you would be so kind
[13:54:13] <shoky> uh go ahead?
[13:54:27] <Trisox> i want to see $$$$$$ dolars
[13:54:40] <Trisox> jQuery questions ;)
[13:55:15] <Bish> i have one: if i use ajax.. and do a request with $.post, i have no clue when that request will be finished right?
[13:55:35] <shoky> before it's finished? no
[13:55:45] <wachpwnski> $(Trisox).ask( function () { answer(); });
[13:56:12] <Bish> and now.. if i want to use that data.. and don't know if it's there that, what is the cleverest way to do that? busy waiting?
[13:56:50] <shoky> Bish: do whatever you need to in the callback
[13:56:55] <shoky> no busy waiting please
[13:58:12] <Bish> yeah, that's what im doing, but what if i'm adding buttons which use data requested with help of the data which got transmitted in the first place
[13:58:27] <Bish> (you don't have to understand taht.. )
[13:58:33] <shoky> i dont rly..
[13:58:40] <shoky> but, what i said still applies
[13:58:44] <shoky> do whatever you need to in the callback
[13:59:07] <trollboy> so I use $.ajax() for everything. I probably use it too much even.  Now, if you log out for inactivity, any url you hit will redirect you to myapp.com/login which is cool, except when I do a ajax call.. as it sits there and hangs all day.  How do you guys recommend handling such?
[13:59:41] <shoky> trollboy why does it sit there and hang all day? the server should respond with something..
[14:00:04] <NoiseEee> sounds like a teenager
[14:00:42] <cilaes> I found out what is making my page weird... $("#the_lights").fadeTo(1,0); makes my page text non-selectable, and nothing else works... any ideas?
[14:01:04] <cilaes> http://pastebin.com/pUsWp4G0
[14:01:29] <trollboy> shoky that's the oddest part.. according to firebug myapp.com/login never finishes loading
[14:01:53] <trollboy> I'm simulating this issue by having two tabs open, loading one, logging out on tab2, then requesting more data on tab1
[14:01:55] <shoky> trollboy: that sounds like a serverside issue, not clientside..
[14:02:04] <Trisox> is it crossdomain?
[14:02:09] <trollboy> same domain
[14:03:00] <Trisox> mmm
[14:03:56] <shoky> trollboy: but, why is it trying to load /login anyway, if you're requesting some in-session data
[14:04:08] <trollboy> session's expired though shoky
[14:04:22] <trollboy> I noticed it as I just got back from lunch and tried to refresh data and got nothing
[14:04:24] <shoky> so? client in tab1 doesnt know that
[14:04:49] <trollboy> a quick peak into firebug showed I was now pulling /login not /reporting/ajaxRpt
[14:04:59] <trollboy> correct shoky
[14:05:11] <trollboy> I'm trying to ask how the client can parse that and redirect the whole page
[14:05:18] <Trisox> time for bed cu all
[14:05:19] <shoky> parse what?
[14:05:27] <trollboy> night Trisox
[14:05:30] <Trisox> night
[14:08:35] <dogarrhea2> ooh.
[14:08:49] <dogarrhea2> you don't need any framework to simulate a connection to server
[14:09:14] <dogarrhea2> just use long polling and keep the ajax request in a "hanging" state until it times out or the server responds
[14:09:28] <dogarrhea2> and re-request ajax if the request times out
[14:23:13] <shoky> trollboy: i think a common way to deal with that is setting a timer in the client that fires a bit before the session would time out, and possibly redirects to the login page, or prompts the user for some action
[14:40:53] <cilaes> Is there ANY way to get around IE requiring user input before using .hide()
[14:44:24] <dogarrhea2> someone recommended socket.io.js . robust or not?
[14:49:41] <supsup> Is anyone familiar with the error 'c.x is undefined' on line 1 of the jQuery file, or how i can build a forum or a chat site by chance?
[14:50:04] <shoky> lol.
[14:56:45] <David_Bradbury> So I have: $("#color-picker-box").not("#color-picker").on('click', "*", function(e) { }); - Which to me reads, "When I click #color-picker-box and it isn't #color-picker, do this event"
[14:57:15] <David_Bradbury> But when I click on #color-picker (which is a child of #color-picker-box), it does the event
[14:57:32] <David_Bradbury> However, when I click #color-picker-box itself, it does nothing
[14:58:18] <supsup> ? .not()
[14:58:19] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[14:58:57] <David_Bradbury> I also tried $("#color-picker-box:not(#color-picker)") and $("#color-picker-box").on('click', ':not(#color-picker)"....
[14:59:45] <frewsxcv> Is there a way to bind a window event without overriding the current event?
[15:00:03] <frewsxcv> Like appending to the end of an already existing event
[15:00:13] <ajpiano> David_Bradbury: the way that actually reads is the same as give me all apples that are not oranges
[15:00:18] <lilalinuxHamburg> I have multiple parallel ajax requests and want to defer a callback until all requests are done. I'm trying $.when().done() but that doesn't work. The callback is fired immediately: http://pastebin.com/k5cveLHT
[15:01:36] <ajpiano> David_Bradbury:  i think what you actually need is something like var color_picker = $("#color_picker");  $("#color_picker_box").on("click", function(e) { if (!$.contains( color_picker[0], e.target )) { }  });
[15:02:04] <ajpiano> ?$.contains @ David_Bradbury
[15:02:05] <bot-t> David_Bradbury, :contains() Selector - Select all elements that contain the specified text. http://api.jquery.com/contains-selector/
[15:02:21] <ajpiano> damn
[15:02:25] <ajpiano> ?jQuery.contains
[15:02:26] <bot-t> jQuery.contains(container, contained): Check to see if a DOM element is within another DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.contains/
[15:02:28] <David_Bradbury> Fair enough. I must not fully understand the not selector yet
[15:02:58] <ajpiano> a box of apples is by definition not an apple
[15:03:01] <ajpiano> it has apples inside of it
[15:03:18] <ajpiano> the element with the id color picker box is not the element with the id color picker
[15:03:29] <supsup> what if it's a box shaped like an apple
[15:03:37] <ajpiano> it's still a box
[15:03:44] <supsup> an apple box!
[15:03:52] <David_Bradbury> Of course, but having an apple box and wanting to exclude a labeled apple from the box seems logical enough
[15:04:30] <ajpiano> right, but you actually have to say that
[15:04:49] <supsup> not removes from selection, but the selection was just 1 thing, there nothing to remove (i think)
[15:04:58] <ajpiano> .not() removes from the set things that match the particular thing
[15:04:58] <b-ot> ajpiano, just that
[15:05:28] <gnarf> ajpiano: you just blew my mind
[15:05:34] <ajpiano> the element id $("#foo") matches foo.  then you say "remove from this set elements that don't have this idea
[15:05:35] <ajpiano> haha yeah gnarf
[15:05:37] <shoky> doesn't he want $('#color-picker-box').on('click', ':not(#color-picker)', function..)
[15:05:41] <supsup> dang how that bot do that
[15:06:13] <gnarf> shoky: nope, thats going to mess with things
[15:06:25] <ajpiano> shoky: nope, because an element *inside* of #color-picker will also not have the id color picker
[15:06:35] <shoky> o rite
[15:06:44] <gnarf> effectively, the :not there is saying '*'
[15:06:45] <gnarf>  :)
[15:06:45] <David_Bradbury> I guess I assumed that when I 'select' a parent element, it selects all the child elements
[15:07:05] <ajpiano> nope
[15:07:31] <David_Bradbury> Which in retrospect seems silly, as it doesn't do it in other cases
[15:10:06] <shoky> frewsxcv: when binding with jquery you're adding a handler, not overriding..
[15:17:08] <supsup> this only way i could get it to work, tried what aj said but failed prob missing some idea of .contains http://jsfiddle.net/9jEaJ/
[15:22:53] <lilalinuxHamburg> any idea on my when(deferred) problem?
[15:23:15] <criix> whats the q?
[15:23:16] <shoky> lilalinuxHamburg: your code looks fine
[15:23:29] <lilalinuxHamburg> but it fires immediately
[15:23:44] <shoky> and are you sure that the 2 ajax requests are not responded to, immediately?
[15:23:49] <lilalinuxHamburg> yes
[15:23:54] <lilalinuxHamburg> they take 14s each
[15:24:08] <lilalinuxHamburg> I can see them spinning in firebug
[15:24:12] <criix> sorry.. just joined... code? ;)
[15:24:22] <shoky> criix: http://pastebin.com/k5cveLHT
[15:24:23] <lilalinuxHamburg> http://pastebin.com/k5cveLHT
[15:24:43] <xec> what's AJS?
[15:24:56] <lilalinuxHamburg> that's Atlassian's JS framework
[15:25:11] <lilalinuxHamburg> which includes jquery
[15:25:16] <lilalinuxHamburg> 1.5 I think
[15:26:10] <shoky> got it live somewhere you can link?
[15:26:31] <lilalinuxHamburg> no, only here on my notebook
[15:26:59] <shoky> if you just run one of those requests and put a .done on it
[15:27:00] <lilalinuxHamburg> seems I have to use a semaphore
[15:27:07] <shoky> then it _doesnt_ fire immediately?
[15:27:41] <shoky> without any $.when, i mean
[15:27:45] <criix> you might... want to add async: false to each of the ajax calls...
[15:27:52] <shoky> no you mightn't
[15:28:08] <shoky> ?async
[15:28:08] <bot-t> NEVER SET ASYNC TO FALSE ON YOUR AJAX REQUESTS. At best, doing so causes your entire web site to lock up until the request is finished; more commonly, it causes the user’s ENTIRE BROWSER to lock up. The *only* time a synchronous request is the right thing to do is in a beforeunload handler. Otherwise, DO NOT DO IT.
[15:28:29] <lilalinuxHamburg> same
[15:28:37] <shoky> so it's not the $.when
[15:29:06] <lilalinuxHamburg> i see
[15:29:10] <shoky> doesn't make much sense..
[15:29:23] <lilalinuxHamburg> no
[15:29:25] <shoky> if the callback is called then you can log the response data
[15:29:36] <shoky> meaning, the request has been responded to, immediately
[15:29:42] <lilalinuxHamburg> I meant it's the same, if I have only one deferred in the when
[15:29:45] <shoky> (or cached)
[15:30:01] <shoky> and if you don't use $.when ?
[15:30:02] <lilalinuxHamburg> status 0, abort false
[15:30:16] <criix> i think in this case, the AJAZ calls are required to finish before anything else should be done...
[15:30:22] <criix> i think in this case, the AJAX calls are required to finish before anything else should be done...
[15:31:57] <lilalinuxHamburg> TypeError: AJS.$.ajax({url: "/rest/jiragroupmanagementrestresource/latest/group/jira-users-ldap"}).done is not a function
[15:32:38] <lilalinuxHamburg> AJS.$.ajax( {url:'/rest/jiragroupmanagementrestresource/latest/group/jira-users-ldap'} ).done(function() {console.log("done")});
[15:32:53] <shoky> console.log(AJS.$.fn.jquery)  ?
[15:33:40] <lilalinuxHamburg> 1.5.2
[15:34:32] <shoky> umm. $.ajax(...).done should work fine in 1.5.2
[15:34:46] <shoky> you got some funky shit goin on ;S
[15:35:08] <shoky> maybe the AJS crap who knows
[15:35:30] <lilalinuxHamburg> :-)
[15:35:38] <lilalinuxHamburg> yeah, probably
[15:35:54] <lilalinuxHamburg> I'll use a semaphore :-)
[15:35:59] <shoky> :\
[15:37:01] <lilalinuxHamburg> maybe it has to do with the oAuth magic that is applied to all ajax requests
[15:37:12] <lilalinuxHamburg> although in that case the request isn't proxied
[15:37:29] <shoky> if you were using a real jquery 1.5.2
[15:37:33] <shoky> .done would work
[15:37:45] <shoky> donno how using a semaphore would let you suddenly use .done btw
[15:39:51] <lilalinuxHamburg> with the semaphore I'll add a call to the end of the each individual success function
[15:40:02] <lilalinuxHamburg> and if the semaphore is 0, the callback is executed
[15:40:24] <shoky> ah using success not done, k
[15:40:30] <lilalinuxHamburg> yeah
[15:40:43] <shoky> that's jquery 1.4 territory
[15:40:45] <shoky> enjoy
[15:40:50] <lilalinuxHamburg> :-)
[15:41:10] <frewsxcv> shoky: So if I have $(window).bind('whatever', myfunc1) and $(window).bind('whatever', 'myfunc2), myfunc1 will still be called?
[15:41:39] <lilalinuxHamburg> thx for your help, gotta go to bed now :-)
[15:43:19] <shoky> ?tias @ frewsxcv
[15:43:19] <bot-t> frewsxcv, Try It And See
[15:57:34] <Guest75270> should i be able to trigger an event on an element and catch the message on the same element?
[16:02:18] <shoky> Guest75270 if by "catch the message" you mean "handle the event" then yea
[16:02:47] <Guest75270> mk, thx
[16:15:01] <manouch> hi
[16:15:02] <manouch> i
[16:15:09] <manouch> is jquery.ui dead?
[16:15:39] <diverdude> manouch: getting there i think
[16:15:44] <coldhead> god i wish
[16:15:44] <bot-t> (1 hour 58 mins ago) <SlexAxton> tell coldhead - 20 years of AndADesk.mp3 - http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/features/2012/sneakers_20th_anniversary/robert_redford_sidney_poitier_and_ben_kingsley_made_one_very_prescient_movie_.html
[16:17:18] <manouch> mhh is there any trendy fancy alternative?
[16:17:27] <manouch> that i _must_ use
[16:17:58] <manouch> just need a bit of accordion and a bit of tabbing
[16:18:05] <coldhead> jquery ui is still the most used, most tested and most documented
[16:18:13] <manouch> mh ok
[16:18:24] <manouch> thanks
[16:34:50] <sjeijk> manouch seen twitter bootstrap?
[16:43:17] <LoneStar99> need to update a value in a json how would i go about that?
[16:44:34] <coldhead> decode and re-encode
[16:45:34] <LoneStar99> coldhead: how would that work
[16:46:08] <coldhead> json is not a good format for editing
[16:46:21] <LoneStar99> yeah, need to get it working for a test...
[16:46:35] <coldhead> var x = JSON.parse(ur_json); x.some_key = some_new_value; ur_json = JSON.stringify(x);
[16:46:40] <coldhead> somie lie da
[16:47:00] <LoneStar99> coldhead:
[16:47:01] <LoneStar99> k
[16:48:22] <frewsxcv> It's not terrible for editing
[16:48:28] <frewsxcv> (IMHO)
[16:48:43] <coldhead> i mean programmatic editing
[16:48:48] <coldhead> regular expressions and so on
[16:48:53] <coldhead> its fine to edit by hand
[16:48:55] <ShooterMG> Anyone know of a good carousel plugin that would cycle images and captions? I'd like to display an image, then a brief delay, then fade the caption in on top of it
[16:49:01] <ShooterMG> my first thought was just use two carousels
[16:49:01] <coldhead> i assumed that was not the issue
[16:50:15] <LoneStar99> coldhead thanks
[16:50:53] <coldhead> ShooterMG: i would use the trusty old jQuery cycle with some extra code in the callbacks to handle the captions
[16:51:09] <ShooterMG> ok, good to hear. thanks :)
[16:54:31] <Aeroo> quick question:   this.$() === $(this)  ?
[16:54:43] <coldhead> lawd no
[16:54:48] <Aeroo> egads
[16:55:02] <coldhead> i shudder to think how this.$() coul possibly work
[16:55:07] <coldhead> could*
[16:56:54] <raj> yo shoky, you around?
[16:57:06] <shoky> ey raj
[16:57:13] <raj> awesome :)
[16:57:19] <shoky> ;D
[16:57:40] <raj> so I moved on from socket.io
[16:57:54] <raj> sockjs is the new it
[16:58:00] <shoky> izzit
[16:58:11] <raj> but I'm a bit confused about something
[16:59:23] <shoky> my only experience with either of those is that time i tried helping you with socket.io :p
[16:59:39] <raj> how does _dispatchmessage end up going to the conn.onmessage function? ( https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client/blob/master/lib/sockjs.js#L89 --> https://github.com/fafhrd91/pyramid_sockjs/blob/master/examples/chat.pt#L32 )
[17:00:03] <raj> oh damn, I should really pm that
[17:00:04] <raj> sorry
[17:01:12] <shoky> you're asking someth about how sockjs works internally?
[17:02:11] <azbyin> hi all.. does a .change() handler for a <select> survive removal of that <select> from the doc tree?
[17:03:03] <azbyin> i.e. is that very same select is added back into the tree (but maybe a different location), will that .change() handler still be triggered on changing selection in the dropdown?
[17:03:23] <raj> I guess, I was just trying to follow the JS but I don't see how they connect
[17:03:28] <shoky> azbyin: if you .remove() it then it wont survive. if you .detach() it it will
[17:03:28] <raj> shoky ^^
[17:03:43] <azbyin> shoky, thanks.
[17:03:49] <shoky> raj but you're asking about how it works internally right? not about how to use it
[17:03:57] <azbyin> i was .empty()ing the parent cotainer :)
[17:04:04] <shoky> just so im clear on what im looking at
[17:04:22] <shoky> azbyin: yea that'll remove the handlers too
[17:05:54] <azbyin> yes, it was killing the handler association. i should have been using detach on the correct element. thanks
[17:14:29] <Aeroo> coldhead  ah, this is an Emberjs specific thing, i didn't realize that
[17:15:06] <coldhead> you know who knows about ember? vladikoff does!
[17:15:10] <coldhead> ask him anything
[17:15:38] <vladikoff> o shiiii
[17:18:15] <Aeroo> hah ok well lets try….. vladikoff what is the difference between this.$() and $(this) in Ember, given that "this" is an Ember.View or extension thereof  ?
[17:19:47] <coldhead> in your face, vladikoff :P
[17:19:48] <vladikoff> Aeroo, inside a view, this.$(); is the jquery reference for the dom element of the view
[17:20:08] <vladikoff> Aeroo, if you call $(this) inside that view it will just give that view class
[17:20:34] <Aeroo> ah ok -- excellent
[17:20:38] <vladikoff> Aeroo, i can't find the doc for this in ember, but here's a doc for the same thing in backbone http://backbonejs.org/#View-$el
[17:21:06] <Aeroo> vladikoff cheers for the explicit answer
[17:31:27] <rotham> hey
[17:31:40] <rotham> how can i remove all .click listeners from a series of elements?
[17:32:06] <shoky> .off('click')
[17:32:21] <rotham> that is badass and easy, thank you
[17:32:47] <coldhead> much like yourself
[17:32:48] <hackeron> hey, I want to add "10px" to this width: $("#sidebar-nav").css('width') -- how would I do it?
[17:33:02] <hackeron> I tried to do $("#sidebar-nav").css('width') + 10px but that returns "220px10px"
[17:33:38] <rotham> shoky:  i think that is for a newer jquery.. if you know what will work with 1.6.2 that would be cool... otherwise I am retreating to google :P
[17:33:40] <shoky> hackeron: use parseInt/parseFloat
[17:34:00] <shoky> rotham: .unbind('off')
[17:34:03] <hackeron> shoky: no cleaner way?
[17:34:33] <shoky> hackeron: .width() + 10  should work too
[17:35:41] <MistuhKurtz> width() returns an integer yes
[17:36:01] <MistuhKurtz> I'm not sure if it can differ from a CSS width attribute though.
[17:36:12] <hackeron> this did it: $("#sidebar-nav").width() + 10
[17:36:16] <shoky> it might, i think
[17:36:31] <hackeron> shoky: it does if it is changed by javascript
[17:36:36] <shoky> there was a recent blog entry about it and changes in 1.8 or 1.8.1 or smth
[17:36:43] <MistuhKurtz> I feel like it might as well shoky. Difference between rendered dimensions and the CSS rule.

[18:00:27] <HAPPYFUNBRO> yo are there any plugins out there that allow me to set CSS position fixed on the y axis, but position relative or absolute on the x axis?
[18:02:53] <neumino> Using two divs should make the trick HAPPYFUNBRO no?
[18:03:28] <HAPPYFUNBRO> I need it for a single axis
[18:03:32] <HAPPYFUNBRO> *single div
[18:04:58] <HAPPYFUNBRO> for example: go to the following site, scroll down the page a bit (800+ px), then zoom, and scroll to the right. You'll notice that the fixed div floats to the right as well. I need it to not do that. http://testsite.inyourspeakers.com/
[18:06:22] <neumino> HAPPYFUNBRO, just use position:fixed and top: <value>px
[18:06:25] <neumino> and don't define left
[18:06:31] <neumino> That's what you want no?
[18:07:35] <HAPPYFUNBRO> neumino look at the CSS. left is not defined
[18:07:42] <HAPPYFUNBRO> top is set to 0
[18:07:45] <HAPPYFUNBRO> it still floats
[18:09:41] <neumino> HAPPYFUNBRO, which css ?
[18:09:49] <neumino> Ph
[18:09:50] <neumino> Oh
[18:09:52] <neumino> Let me check
[18:13:25] <HAPPYFUNBRO> hm
[18:13:58] <HAPPYFUNBRO> also, is there a way to bind to a zoom event?
[18:25:03] <HAPPYFUNBRO> ok
[18:25:06] <HAPPYFUNBRO> so for scroll
[18:25:15] <HAPPYFUNBRO> how do I set it to ANY scroll event on a given page?>
[18:59:24] <MattBrotz> I need help with the date picker please, how do I use a function upon selecting a date?
[19:00:25] <MattBrotz> and how do I get the date?
[19:00:48] <shoky> MattBrotz: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/ztYAG/4/
[19:01:34] <MattBrotz> Great Thanks shoky!!! :)
[19:11:59] <MattBrotz> How do I split by a new line, a space, and or a "/"
[19:17:46] <LindsayMac> Hey guys.. do you have any idea why the background images on this site jump around when smooth scrolling in chrome??> http://www.millwrightsrestaurant.com/
[19:19:33] <MattBrotz> LindsayMac, what do you mean why?, I think its a flash site
[19:19:42] <LindsayMac> its not flash
[19:19:51] <MattBrotz> oh nvm
[19:19:57] <LindsayMac> and I want to know why its jumping around a little in Chrome and not other browsers
[19:20:25] <MattBrotz> but isn't suppose to jump around?
[19:20:52] <LindsayMac> No if you look closely, it jumps around by a couple of pixels as it slides..it doesnt look solid
[19:21:00] <LindsayMac> hard to explain if you dont see it off the back
[19:21:21] <LindsayMac> off the batt*
[19:21:51] <LindsayMac> it almost seems as if the browser is painting it off by a pixel and then adjusting
[19:23:27] <LindsayMac> its so random and weird
[19:27:53] <tw2113> and nitpicky :P
[19:28:49] <tw2113> no one not knowing to look for it will likely notice it
[19:28:55] <tw2113> plus no one uses chrome anyway
[19:28:56] <tw2113> :D
[19:30:17] <LindsayMac> I disagree.. its one of those things that is there and you can kinda sense it is glitchy but its not overtly glitchy
[19:30:30] <LindsayMac> plus.. I WANNA KNOW WHY!
[19:30:48] <tw2113> because google hates you
[19:32:19] <HAPPYFUNBRO> is there a way to detect how much a browser has ZOOMED?
[19:39:05] <LindsayMac> Oh well.. ill ask again tomorrow.. or scrap the whole thing and start over ;)
[19:43:49] <blast_hardcheese> Sorry to bug, but what's wrong with this? $.get('/data.json', function() { console.log("blah"); });
[19:45:01] <blast_hardcheese> I've removed the arguments to the callback, to not confuse things
[19:45:38] <blast_hardcheese> I'm also getting a 200 in the server logs
[19:45:58] <coldhead> blast_hardcheese: check the response in web inspector or firebug
[19:46:14] <coldhead> it might be a problem with the headers
[19:46:23] <blast_hardcheese> coldhead: Good point, hold on
[19:46:26] <coldhead> you might need to specify a dataType: 'json'
[19:46:40] <blast_hardcheese> I've tried getJSON, same response
[19:46:57] <blast_hardcheese> As it turns out I'm not getting anything on the server side
[19:47:21] <HAPPYFUNBRO> is there a way to detect how much a browser has ZOOMED?
[19:47:59] <blast_hardcheese> coldhead: Headers look fine, response is correct
[19:48:16] <blast_hardcheese> it's just not calling the callback
[19:48:35] <vladikoff> HAPPYFUNBRO, not easy, see: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5078596/1657521 Thanks!
[19:49:36] <HAPPYFUNBRO> grrreat!
[19:49:45] <HAPPYFUNBRO> cmon jquery fix yo ish!
[19:52:46] <blast_hardcheese> var xhr = $.get('/data.js?foo=3', {}, function() { console.log("blah"); }, 'json')
[19:53:17] <blast_hardcheese> The callback isn't getting called; This is true with .js or .json as the file extension
[19:53:22] <blast_hardcheese> getting a 200 back from the server
[19:54:12] <coldhead> blast_hardcheese: can you get() anything?
[19:54:38] <coldhead> what if you try .get('/'
[19:54:46] <blast_hardcheese> oh, disregard. I had to use .error() on the resultant xhr object, the arguments tell me I've got a parse error.
[19:54:52] <blast_hardcheese> I was expecting just a string.
[19:55:09] <coldhead> >: |
[19:55:13] <blast_hardcheese> bleh.
[19:57:15] <blast_hardcheese> coldhead: ugh. Nothing is parsing successfully, even though I've copied the contents directly out of JSON.stringify() response
[19:57:31] <coldhead> jsonlint?
[19:57:36] <coldhead> ?jsonlint
[19:57:37] <bot-t> JSONLint - The JSON Validator. - http://www.jsonlint.com/
[19:57:44] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[19:57:44] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[19:57:49] <coldhead> just in case
[19:58:11] <blast_hardcheese> coldhead: "Valid JSON"
[19:58:18] <coldhead> ?cc
[19:58:18] <bot-t> CASE CLOASED >: |
[19:58:24] <blast_hardcheese> :|
[19:58:44] <blast_hardcheese> OK, let's try this again.
[19:58:47] <coldhead> i'd be double checking the headers
[19:59:21] <blast_hardcheese> The Content-Type is text/javascript, could that be the issue?
[20:08:06] <blast_hardcheese> coldhead: You're right, it was trying to determine the type by Content-Type
[20:08:16] <blast_hardcheese> coldhead: forcing json "fixed" it
[20:08:16] <ahabman> Is there an official optimization guide? Are blog posts from a year ago outdated?
[20:08:58] <coldhead> blast_hardcheese: i usually write the type explicitly just to document it and avoid such woes
[20:09:13] <coldhead> ahabman: no official guide i am aware of, mostly just test cases on jsperf.com
[20:09:23] <blast_hardcheese> coldhead: gotcha.
[20:10:26] <ahabman> coldhead: thank you, I'll check into jsperf
[20:11:06] <jrockjiggz_lapto> hi, if I have data as a string: var myData = 'name=Jerome&email=A@B.C'  --  in an $.ajax({}) function can I simply put  data: myData ?
[20:11:38] <butblack> what's wrong with my jquerY? https://gist.github.com/3695675
[20:11:50] <butblack> the request in my code works.. but the jquery isn't working
[20:12:05] <butblack> if you need other information let me know, I'll be more then happy to provide it
[20:12:34] <butblack> than*
[20:12:36] <coldhead> jrockjiggz_lapto: that's a good question, i would Try It And See to find out
[20:12:58] <butblack> it's rendering an XMLHttpRequest.. but I don't know what to do with that
[20:16:46] <jrockjiggz_lapto> coldhead: I would tias.. but.. im not if your serious (about being a good question) or i'm just asking a very noob question.
[20:16:58] <vladikoff> butblack, works here http://jsfiddle.net/yhmbx/
[20:17:24] <butblack> vladikoff: it does?
[20:17:25] <coldhead> its a good question, jrockjiggz_lapto
[20:17:33] <coldhead> i feel like i should know the answer and i don't
[20:17:35] <vladikoff> butblack, click "run", you see button
[20:17:42] <jrockjiggz_lapto> yeaaa. ok i'll let you know
[20:19:39] <vladikoff> later HAPPYFUNBRO, hope you had fun bro.
[20:20:12] <AnonymousPrime> jrockjiggz_lapto i can confirm that works
[20:20:14] <LoneStar99> anyone running chrome here?
[20:20:29] <vladikoff> LoneStar99, sorry Firefox only
[20:20:44] <LoneStar99> need to confirm a bug...
[20:21:02] <vladikoff> LoneStar99, tell us more
[20:22:57] <LoneStar99> http://icitystream.com/index2.php top ticker on all browsers looks fine, but on chrome the ticker images appear one below the other...
[20:24:29] <jrockjiggz_lapto> coldhead: yes, data will pass as a string
[20:24:51] <LoneStar99> f*cking chrome
[20:26:39] <vladikoff> LoneStar99, your <ul> has a width of 10px
[20:27:09] <vladikoff> LoneStar99, that can't be good
[20:27:49] <LoneStar99> hmmmm let me look at that
[20:28:26] <vladikoff> LoneStar99, if you fix the width then it looks proper
[20:29:03] <LoneStar99> vladikoff: ok let me fix that
[20:39:44] <aram535> Hi ,I have http://jsfiddle.net/ambiguous/CQDe8/1/ as a static append, but I need it to be more dynamic and I wouldn't mind if it it was more K: V pair rather than hard coded.  I can't seem to figure out how to build the elements.
[20:46:11] <LoneStar99> vladikoff: i think that might have fixed the issue.
[20:46:18] <LoneStar99> anyone here with chrome?
[20:46:35] <vladikoff> LoneStar99, looks fixed
[20:48:17] <LoneStar99> ok thanks
[20:54:54] <butblack> I've been looking at this for 2 hours
[20:54:56] <butblack> https://gist.github.com/3695464
[20:55:05] <butblack> I can't get the javascript to switch buttons back and forth
[20:55:19] <butblack> the request goes in, it POST's 2 times to the database (not sure why)
[20:55:43] <butblack> does anyone know why it POSTs 2 times or why it might not be rendering correctly?
[21:03:27] <vladikoff> butblack, how many follow buttons do you have on the page?
[21:03:33] <butblack> 1
[21:03:57] <butblack> vladikoff: 1
[21:03:58] <vladikoff> butblack, do you have any more jquery on your page for that button?
[21:04:01] <coldhead> in your face flod
[21:04:10] <butblack> vladikoff: nope, just that
[21:04:32] <butblack> vladikoff: If I comment out the code in the js files the same thing happens..
[21:04:42] <butblack> vladikoff: I'm not sure why..
[21:09:03] <azbyin> ok, this is weird... i have a <select> within a <span>. on selecting anything within the <select> another <span><select>...</select></span>  is .show()n next to it
[21:09:16] <azbyin> when this happens, the original span changes in width by 4 pixels!
[21:09:25] <azbyin> I cannot figure out how this is happening.
[21:12:16] <butblack> vladikoff: any idea?
[21:12:25] <coldhead> something to do with floats maybe, azbyin?
[21:13:24] <azbyin> and when i tried to replicate the problem in a little test, it didn;t occur
[21:13:57] <coldhead> something CSSy
[21:14:01] <coldhead> and perfidious
[21:15:12] <azbyin> yeah, initially i thought i didn;t assign a class/id properly or similar, but my little test shows identical document tree and styling in firebug to the strange doc
[21:15:13] <azbyin> grr
[21:20:17] <d4sh> sup suckas
[21:23:52] <coldhead> how rude
[21:36:47] <ibodi> what does this mean: str=str.replace(/^\s+/, '');
[21:37:12] <ibodi> and this : str=str.replace(/\s+$/,'');
[21:37:14] <ibodi> trim () ?
[21:39:47] <ibodi> coldhead: ?
[21:40:37] <coldhead> remove space from the beginning and ends of a string, respectively
[21:41:01] <ibodi> ha. thanks.
[21:41:30] <ibodi> coldhead: and what does this mean: str=str.replace(/\s+/g,' ');
[21:41:49] <coldhead> that replaces every instance of one or more spaces with a single space
[21:42:19] <coldhead> ?eval 's p  a   c     e      y'.replace(/\s+/g,' ');
[21:42:27] <bot-t> coldhead: No output. (Process Killed)
[21:42:32] <coldhead> oh that's sad
[21:42:52] <mdelcx_> is teh twitters busted for anyone else?
[21:43:36] <coldhead> it's not not busted for this guy!
[21:43:48] <ibodi> ok. thanks a ton
[21:43:53] <coldhead> oh, it's working
[21:44:28] <ibodi> i never learn regex -- my week pit
[21:44:34] <ibodi> weak*
[21:46:28] <ibodi> coldhead: i never know what is right, and what is left. so i gave up drive all my life :D
[21:49:46] <coldhead> ibodi: regular expressions are so worth learning
[21:49:53] <coldhead> you will save hundreds of hours
[21:49:56] <coldhead> for the rest of your life
[21:50:13] <youi> i belive its time for the old adage
[21:50:25] <youi> so you have a problem..and you decide to solve it using regular expressions...now you have 2 problems
[21:52:49] <ibodi> coldhead: hopefully you do not mind . i totally blind in this func
[21:53:19] <ibodi> learned several times. give up :|
[21:53:41] <coldhead> you have a problem.. you decide to solve it without using regular expressions...now you have a finite state machine that took 2 years to develop and which you can barely comprehened and your wife has left you and your friends are all dead
[21:53:47] <coldhead> i'll take the 2 problems, thank you
[21:54:18] <coldhead> some day, ibodi, chee and i will finish our regular expression game and you can have fun learning
[21:54:41] <ibodi> haha
[21:54:58] <jmoney> as long as that problem isn't 'i need to build a parser for hierarchical data'
[22:09:59] <datarecall> anyone know why the .submit is not firing : http://jsfiddle.net/qtBSS/2/
[22:10:11] <coldhead> probably some kind of bug

[22:11:44] <vladikoff> datarecall, your submit button is outside of the form bro
[22:12:06] <datarecall> geeze
[22:12:49] <bigLanky> http://dwight.team4.ciplex.com/charity <-- hover over the events link, and watch the dropdown menu as you move off and back on
[22:12:54] <bigLanky> it shrinks the container for some reason

[22:14:30] <nayers1981> hey coldhead you on tonight
[22:15:57] <coldhead> er, more or less, off and of
[22:17:00] <nayers1981> lol
[22:17:30] <sasori> hi, how to alert the object value inside the <span> tags ? ...e.g i have <span class='stuff'>$phpobj->PERSON</span>...but when i alert it, it says Objec[Object]
[22:17:43] <nayers1981> You sent me some code to try and clean up all the diff scripts im having trouble with it. it doesnt seam to want to work for me..
[22:18:02] <coldhead> give us a look, nayers1981
[22:18:23] <nayers1981> just got home from work let me bring it up
[22:18:30] <coldhead> sasori: alert( $('.stuff').text() );
[22:19:10] <coldhead> you know what i find inspirational? dogs with no legs
[22:20:13] <sasori> coldhead: it doesn't show any :)
[22:20:30] <sasori> coldhead: i tried it like this jQuery(jQuery(this).find('span').text()); ...but it alerted [object Object]
[22:20:49] <coldhead> sasori: jQuery() anything returns an object
[22:20:59] <coldhead> you have to use text() or html() to get at the uh text or html
[22:21:06] <coldhead> do you really need to alert(), anyway?
[22:21:17] <coldhead> you can't use the more featureful console.log() ?
[22:21:26] <sasori> actually no, i just need to see if I am getting the correct value, so that i can do ajax
[22:21:37] <nayers1981> http://pastie.org/4699814
[22:21:42] <vladikoff> sasori, $(this).find('span').text()
[22:22:06] <sasori> i cannot use $ ..because there's a js conflict, that's why am using jQuery
[22:22:18] <vladikoff> sasori, jQuery(this).find('span').text()
[22:22:40] <sasori> vladikoff: it's the same..it alerts [object Object]
[22:22:45] <sasori> is this because it's a php object ?
[22:23:21] <sasori> <span class='stuff'><?php echo $phpobject->ATTRIBUTE; ?></span>

[22:23:41] <coldhead> you need to use ?ready
[22:23:44] <bot-t> .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/

[22:51:48] <coldhead> that's very new
[22:53:28] <tw2113> newer than you in here coldhead ?
[22:53:40] <coldhead> not that new
[22:53:43] <coldhead> newish though
[22:53:46] <coldhead> same generation
[22:57:54] <LoneStar99> how do I convert [object Object],[object Object] back into json?
[22:59:23] <tw2113> make coldhead do it LoneStar99
[22:59:28] <tw2113> he takes cans of air as payment
[22:59:37] <tw2113> imported from Druidia only though
[23:00:14] <LoneStar99> tw2113
[23:00:19] <LoneStar99> right on
[23:00:35] <tw2113> to be honest, i didn't notice the nick until after i made the joke
[23:01:06] <LoneStar99> k
[23:01:51] <foo> if I'm using hashes in URL, is a / before hash "proper", or does it not matter? eg. site.com/page/#something
[23:02:53] <coldhead> shouldn't matter
[23:02:58] <foo> ok, thanks coldhead
[23:03:05] <coldhead> unless the server is an uppity bitch
[23:03:09] <coldhead> which CAN happen
[23:04:29] <tw2113> especially godaddy servers
[23:07:08] <coldhead> nayers1981: i'm not helping you with a phishing site am i?
[23:07:28] <nayers1981> no its for work
[23:07:42] <tw2113> phishing is srs business
[23:08:07] <LoneStar99> var gg =  JSON.stringify(json);  was the answer
[23:08:11] <nayers1981> its pulling information for something called helpfull hints I am a quality analyst
[23:08:44] <granden> coldhead: You being serious with that link? :)
[23:09:17] <granden> It more looked like a prank to me :) But ok, when I said podcast I more wanted only audio podcasts. As I thought listening to it while driving to work.
[23:13:42] <vladikoff> tw2113, haha i see what you did
[23:20:42] <LoneStar99> trying to make a change to 1: "date_completed" in the following --> http://jsfiddle.net/fCMYB/1/
[23:27:56] <Cork> LoneStar99: you have an object with string number keys, with objects
[23:28:03] <Cork> jon8: you can't loop that with a while
[23:28:31] <coldhead> granden: that is a serious new podcast, you should join me on twitter in pleading for them to do an audio only download
[23:28:41] <Cork> well actually seen how you loop it it should work
[23:29:09] <Cork> LoneStar99: but its json[0][len] not just json[len] you have an outer array with one object in it
[23:33:07] <LoneStar99> Cork: oh ok let me try that thanks!
[23:33:25] <Cork> LoneStar99: no just checked and it fails earlier
[23:33:34] <Cork> your duing length on the outer array
[23:33:46] <Cork> the object doesn't have a length so you fail there if you try
[23:34:27] <LoneStar99> yeah need the inner array....
[23:34:43] <Cork> there is no inner array
[23:35:05] <Cork> you have an outer array with an inner object, and in the inner object you have multible objects
[23:35:24] <Cork> {"1":{"user_id":1,"status_id":1,"task":"Walk the dog","date_completed":1}} is not an array
[23:35:31] <Cork> [{"user_id":1,"status_id":1,"task":"Walk the dog","date_completed":1}] is
[23:36:47] <LoneStar99> to parse I use $.each(tasks, function(entryIndex, entry) { ...  });
[23:37:04] <Cork> ya, cause each know how to loop and object
[23:37:52] <Cork> LoneStar99: http://jsfiddle.net/fCMYB/2/
[23:38:16] <Cork> or even http://jsfiddle.net/fCMYB/3/
[23:38:36] <Cork> opps
[23:38:47] <Cork> len needs to start at 0 not 1 :x
[23:40:42] <Cork> LoneStar99: http://jsfiddle.net/fCMYB/4/
[23:41:26] <LoneStar99> Cork: ok sweet!
[23:41:29] <LoneStar99> thanks!
[23:41:33] <Cork> np
[23:43:08] <sasori> what could probably the reason if my ajax is returning a response of html sourcode instead of the succes ok message alert ?
[23:46:37] <LoneStar99> sasori: hmmm....
[23:46:49] <coldhead> some kind of bug?
[23:53:47] <granden> coldhead: Sure will! You twittername? Same as nick?
[23:55:21] <LoneStar99> Cork: not sure why this is occuring --> http://jsfiddle.net/fCMYB/5/
[23:56:02] <Cork> LoneStar99: why what is occuring?
[23:56:15] <Cork> why you can't loop the string?
[23:56:30] <Cork> json = JSON.parse(talks)
[23:56:33] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does Jquery offer a tooltip functionality by default?
[23:56:44] <Cork> no, not yet
[23:56:50] <ecky--ptang-zoob> kk
[23:57:01] <coldhead> not ever
[23:57:12] <Cork> well i meant in jquery-ui
[23:57:15] <Cork> http://wiki.jqueryui.com/w/page/12138112/Tooltip
