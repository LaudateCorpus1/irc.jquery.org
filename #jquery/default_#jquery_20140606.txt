[00:01:09] <dokma> duch_kazatel, this is what I get: http://jsfiddle.net/XXz7U/
[00:01:27] <dokma> now each of these paragraphs needs to be appended to a div that has the same key
[00:02:03] <duch_kazatel> dokma so for each p, append it to a div with an ID equal to it's data-tracker value?
[00:02:16] <dokma> exactly
[00:02:27] <duch_kazatel> you need to use .each() then.
[00:02:47] <dokma> that was my first hunch
[00:02:49] <duch_kazatel> and for each P, test if that div exists.  if not, create the div, then append that p
[00:02:52] <dokma> but thought there was a better way
[00:03:03] <duch_kazatel> what you're trying to do is pretty odd.
[00:03:16] <dokma> why do you think so?
[00:03:31] <duch_kazatel> why not output from your backend the way you want it?
[00:04:11] <dokma> cannot be output from the backend because these are chat messages that come in from a long poll
[00:04:31] <duch_kazatel> okay.  and are you appending them to these divs to visually connect them?
[00:04:38] <dokma> yes
[00:04:50] <duch_kazatel> then yeah, you'll be doing some manual work for that.
[00:04:50] <dokma> each message goes to it's 'window'
[00:05:01] <dokma> thank you very much!
[00:05:12] <duch_kazatel> sure.
[00:21:20] <dddh> to jquery or not to jquery
[00:24:18] <xec> is that the question?
[00:26:14] <dddh> I guess it is not a question here
[01:14:24] <adsisco> http://www.masterlecture.com/mod/tutorrank/ how can i achieve the grid view here?
[01:16:26] <seutje> adsisco: CSS
[01:16:47] <seutje> looks like they're fixed height and float left
[01:18:35] <adsisco> any example? i need the pagination too
[01:36:58] <daschel> am i connected?
[01:37:04] <daschel> yup
[01:37:37] <daschel> what is more efficient, resizing with media queries or using javascript?
[01:47:31] <jop008> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.parsejson/ what it will return when json string is not wel formed?
[01:53:30] <cjldn> hello there. I've built a selector tool, where users can select different options on a form and depending on those option, one div is displayed and another 2 stay hidden. Any idea how could I store the times each of these 3 divs was displayed? Thanks in advance
[02:13:02] <ph88> does someone know a good min/max slider where i can give part of the slider a different color?  example: http://i.imgur.com/qB2nSTX.png
[02:14:22] <seutje> pretty much any slider will allow you to put styles on the thing
[02:14:50] <ph88> but wouldn't they have to define different area's/elements so i can color them individually ?
[02:15:01] <ph88> or can i make a background color in different parts ?
[02:15:44] <seutje> yeah, could use a gradient for that
[02:16:04] <ph88> Cool !
[02:17:39] <ph88> seutje: how do i make those gradients so that they don't fade into each other ?
[02:18:12] <ph88> oh wait i found it .. make the colors very close to each other ^^
[02:18:17] <seutje> yeah
[02:43:09] <moreale_> hello ! wondered how can I do to set a background-color to the full width when margins are defined (wanting to keep these margins) ? i.e. setting the grey background where there is the white one http://puu.sh/9hl6Q/d1cf7c239c.jpg
[02:49:35] <seutje> moreale_: put it on the wrapping element?
[02:52:29] <moreale_> seutje_: margins are defined on the body
[03:21:55] <seutje> moreale_: so put it on the html
[03:22:24] <moreale_> seutje_: yeah this is what i did, just added some divs on the php template ^^ thx
[03:23:05] <cjldn> hello there. I've built a selector tool, where users can select different options on a form and depending on those options, one div is displayed and another 2 stay hidden. Any idea how could I store the times each of these 3 divs was displayed? Thanks in advance
[03:23:16] <d0de> can anyone recommend a really simple graph-drawing library for jQuery? I know there are loads. I'm looking for a really simple, lightweight one for line charts if anyone has any tips
[03:23:37] <d0de> cjldn, can you put it in a fiddle?
[03:24:14] <d0de> or at least post the code the hides and displays the divs, even if it isn't tied to anything
[03:24:21] <cjldn> sure
[03:24:26] <cjldn> thx d0de :)
[03:26:48] <papifabi> d0de> morris.js do the job
[03:28:01] <d0de> papifabi, looks great, thanks!
[03:32:05] <cjldn> d0de, that would be roughly speaking how it works: http://jsfiddle.net/5v5BE/
[03:33:00] <cjldn> depending on the values selected on the form, it displays either car01 or car02
[03:34:12] <cjldn> it is working properly, my thing is, how to store the times car01 and car02 divs are displayed
[03:37:26] <cjldn> I guess that will need to store the value on a DB, therefore, I may need to use php
[03:39:03] <d0de> cjldn, you can't you just store the value in an object?
[03:39:11] <d0de> like http://jsfiddle.net/5v5BE/1/
[03:42:03] <cjldn> it sounds like a good idea, however what happens once the session is finished? on a new session the counters would be reset to "0" isn't it?
[03:43:03] <d0de> cjldn, yes, but you can store the value in localStorage and load it at the beginning of a session. Or you could even store it in a cookie if you wanted wider browser support.
[03:43:25] <d0de> to me, that would seem a lot easier than implementing a db
[03:44:11] <d0de> http://caniuse.com/#search=localstorage
[03:44:29] <cjldn> definitely
[03:44:40] <cjldn> thanks you very much d0de :)
[03:44:51] <d0de> cjldn, np you're welcome
[03:50:16] <silverdust> when I have a have a $('.class').empty() , does it take only the contents of that class container or it takes the even the container?
[03:52:42] <decx> wat
[03:52:53] <sacho> just the contents
[03:53:48] <d0de> can't you just test it? http://jsfiddle.net/UMwWQ/
[03:54:57] <decx> i still dont get it
[03:55:16] <decx> do you want to test if an element exists?
[03:57:27] <silverdust> ok thanks
[03:59:00] <silverdust> I just wanted to know if that class will be available for appending new items after I've done a .empty() on it
[03:59:25] <silverdust> seems to be fine
[04:05:26] <dokma> is this conflict safe? (function($) { $.fn.func = function() { return this; }; })(jQuery);
[04:20:45] <sacho> sure
[04:23:30] <asido> what happens when jQuery is being executed like this: ``function bla(){}; $(document).ready(function() { $(bla); });`` found it in production, no idea what that suppose to do
[04:26:56] <papifabi> asido: strange really :(
[04:27:21] <asido> does it call that function?
[04:27:41] <papifabi> noramlly no
[04:28:46] <decx> that's a complicated way to create an empty jquery object
[04:32:24] <sacho> asido, like I said, $(func) is the equivalent to $(document).ready(func)
[04:33:12] <sacho> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery/#jQuery3
[04:33:33] <asido> sacho, ok, thanks
[04:33:54] <sacho> whoever was doing that was confused.
[04:35:35] <papifabi> hu,i just understood,waow , this code is complicate :D
[05:35:23] <paulvd> I am trying to make two elements dropdown on hover over another element, it works fine, but when you move from 1 element to another it does not ? http://jsfiddle.net/d83Yz/1/
[05:39:25] <seutje> paulvd: looks like you're trying to hoverIntent
[05:39:46] <seutje> but yeah, ur problem is that $('.sub-menu').stop(true, true).slideUp(200); selects the sub-menu's globally on the page
[05:40:14] <seutje> so when unhovering one, 200ms later, it will hide *all* submenus
[05:40:41] <seutje> so if u go from one into the other, the other will show up, and 200ms later, both will disappear
[05:40:43] <paulvd> seutje: http://jsfiddle.net/d83Yz/2/
[05:40:59] <paulvd> thanks
[05:41:35] <seutje> paulvd: yeah, there u go... although I'm gonna mention hoverIntent again, it's pretty tested and widely used
[05:43:09] <paulvd> hoverIntent the plugin ?
[05:46:24] <nimius|thephpjo> hello everyone
[05:48:23] <seutje> paulvd: yeah
[05:56:22] <serge> I have a div with margin: 0 auto. How can I get how many px it have from left after rendering?
[05:57:25] <Manaus> hi, is there a shortcut for $(this).find('.container').find('.red').find('span') ?
[05:59:06] <decx> $('.container .red span', this)
[05:59:30] <Manaus> thanks decx
[06:00:43] <d0de> serge, use position()
[06:01:16] <d0de> serge, or perhaps offset()
[06:02:11] <serge> d0de, It seems offset worked for me, thanks
[06:02:33] <d0de> serge, np. offset() is relative to the document, position() is relative to the parent
[06:03:33] <silverdust> what's the equivalent of margin: 0 auto for positioned elements
[06:04:13] <decx> positioned how?
[06:06:41] <silverdust> decx: sorry that wasn't for here
[06:07:25] <seutje> left: 50%; margin-left: -[half the width of the element];
[06:07:30] <BillCriswell> silverdust: I think you're looking for left: 50%; margin-left: - (width / 2);
[06:07:34] <seutje> :)
[06:07:38] <BillCriswell> Dang.
[06:07:40] <BillCriswell> Beat me.
[06:07:49] <d0de> BillCriswell, you have to buy seutje a coke
[06:07:52] <seutje> Cork's slacking
[06:07:55] <silverdust> yea thanks BillCriswell
[06:08:38] <decx> can calc() use an elements width?
[06:09:03] <seutje> don't think so
[06:09:04] <BillCriswell> d0de: Haha.
[06:09:05] <decx> not yet
[06:09:15] <BillCriswell> decx: It'd be pretty sweet if you could.
[06:09:17] <seutje> unless it's like attr(width)
[06:09:47] <decx> because it's pretty annoying to hardcode margin like that
[06:09:58] <ugolin> hi
[06:10:02] <BillCriswell> decx: You could use percentages though and do like width: 50%; left: 50%; margin-left: -25%;
[06:10:13] <ugolin> is there a way to wildcard class element ?
[06:10:16] <BillCriswell> decx: Agreed. A lot of little things about CSS drive me nuts.
[06:10:24] <decx> that doesnt exactly loosen the shackles
[06:10:29] <decx> ya
[06:10:36] <ugolin> example : .removeClass("btn-*")
[06:10:52] <ugolin> to match any btn- something class name ?
[06:11:07] <decx> $('[class*=btn-]').removeAttr('class') ^^
[06:11:23] <decx> that's about as heavyhanded as you can get
[06:11:33] <ugolin> thanks decx
[06:11:36] <BillCriswell> You're remove the class all together though.
[06:11:38] <BillCriswell> removing*
[06:11:48] <ugolin> ah yeah, I was wondering,
[06:11:54] <ugolin> the attribute
[06:12:01] <ugolin> the *whole attr
[06:12:13] <ugolin> was lookin to just remove the pattern matching class
[06:13:23] <decx> that's why i wrote heavyhanded
[06:13:43] <BillCriswell> $('[class*=btn-]').attr('class', function(i, className){ return className.replace(/btn-([^\s]+)/g, ''); }); maybe?
[06:13:49] <decx> i guess you can regex the classlist
[06:13:52] <decx> right
[06:14:10] <ugolin> neat
[06:14:12] <BillCriswell> or split then look through and check class.slice(0,4) === 'btn-'
[06:14:26] <ugolin> trying taht right now
[06:14:56] <decx> substring with indexOf btn-?
[06:15:07] <decx> either way it'll be messy
[06:15:28] <BillCriswell> Yeah... you know btn- would be at the start.
[06:15:52] <BillCriswell> ugolin: I get the feeling you're doing something weird needing to do this though.
[06:16:22] <ugolin> BillCriswell: that's kind of a secret talent of mine to put myself in such situation yes
[06:16:35] <BillCriswell> ugolin: Haha. Totally understood.
[06:16:55] <ugolin> walking the weirdest path when a simple method would do
[06:17:15] <decx> wildcard bitches yeeeehaaaaw
[06:18:02] <BillCriswell> ugolin: http://jsbin.com/qoreqejo/1/edit
[06:18:16] <BillCriswell> If it's useful. Wanted to try it out for some reason.
[06:18:29] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha.
[06:18:37] <BillCriswell> "How about you let me fill you up?"
[06:19:11] <ugolin> BillCriswell: thanks.a.lot
[06:19:24] <BillCriswell> return $.trim(className.replace(/btn-\w+/g, '')); might be better?
[06:19:31] <BillCriswell> I tend to negate too often.
[06:19:48] <BillCriswell> No.problem.at.all.ugolin
[06:19:54] <decx> i'm sure these elements have something in common so you don't need to rely on an attribute selector
[06:20:05] <decx> that shit is slow
[06:23:29] <BillCriswell> I was endorsed for my Wordpress skills on linkedin!
[06:23:39] <BillCriswell> By someone who doesn't know what wordpress is probably.
[06:23:48] <BillCriswell> What a useless system.
[06:24:54] <decx> dont forgot to post in my name a city starting with m thread
[06:25:18] <decx> get*
[06:25:47] <BillCriswell> decx: It's a lot harder than you think!
[06:26:15] <BillCriswell> I'd love to know the ultimate goal of those things.
[06:26:56] <DarsVaeda> any reason why this will always return false for hasClass? http://pastebin.com/mnfK9bJ3
[06:27:16] <DarsVaeda> even after the class is added on the second click it will return false?
[06:27:25] <BillCriswell> Is there like a "Most assholes commented on a photo" award?
[06:27:40] <decx> because you removed the selected class 3 lines above?
[06:28:26] <DarsVaeda> I will go home now -.-
[06:28:33] <decx> ^^
[06:28:47] <BillCriswell> decx is a fucking sleuth.
[06:29:05] <decx> i'm using a new spy technique
[06:29:10] <decx> eyes
[06:30:31] <DarsVaeda> that's because I write a line and 2000 freaking customers call in between writing the second line and I'm so puzzled by their requests I don't know what I am doing :D
[06:30:39] <DarsVaeda> but thanks decx :)
[06:31:13] <BillCriswell> DarsVaeda: That's brutal. The best thing that ever happened to me was getting away from a phone.
[06:31:19] <BillCriswell> Well.. that and Sass.
[06:32:09] <beancurd> the future is awesome
[06:32:17] <beancurd> space space spac espaecs spac space
[06:33:03] <DarsVaeda> there is so little space and so much dark matter...
[06:33:13] <DarsVaeda> why do you care about space :P
[06:33:47] <decx> i have a pizza that comes out nicely without preheating the oven, but i don't have a hoverboard, future get your priorities straight
[06:33:57] <beancurd> because you have to know about the planet.s
[06:34:07] <beancurd> and to know about the planets, you should listen to dr steve brule.
[06:34:16] <BillCriswell> Wonder when there will be a hoverboard. Is the technology even close?
[06:34:22] <beancurd> decx: AMERICUUUHHHHHH
[06:34:29] <BillCriswell> Without it being brutally loud and only running for .5 seconds?
[06:34:44] <beancurd> they've had hover platforms for ages.
[06:35:00] <beancurd> i wouldn't even know where to start with hoverboards..
[06:35:01] <DarsVaeda> BillCriswell, technology is already here
[06:35:06] <decx> it needs a one way interaction with the earths magnetic field
[06:35:20] <beancurd> but then again, a couple of years back, quadcopters were inconceivable.
[06:35:38] <DarsVaeda> BillCriswell, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyOtIsnG71U
[06:36:04] <DarsVaeda> seems we just need to superfrost earth and things will be alright
[06:36:24] <beancurd> DarsVaeda: also make the whole surface a superconductor...
[06:36:25] <decx> and replace streets with magnets
[06:36:45] <BillCriswell> DarsVaeda: Yeah, I want a hoverboard that works on anything haha.
[06:37:01] <seutje> quadcopters have been around for a while though
[06:37:01] <decx> well you do need power over water that is obvious
[06:37:04] <BillCriswell> DarsVaeda: Still cool though.
[06:37:06] <seutje> they just got dirt cheap
[06:37:07] <DarsVaeda> but considering all the ufo sightings it seems someone already had a better idea
[06:37:13] <decx> cool.... eheheheh
[06:37:27] <beancurd> those things seem like a recipe for disaster.. i don't even trust myself on those roller shoes.
[06:37:30] <beancurd> or soap shoes.
[06:37:33] <beancurd> who remembers them.
[06:37:46] <seutje> where there's  a lil wheel in the heel?
[06:37:56] * DarsVaeda suddenly feels his appearance cause a hell of offtopic *blush*
[06:38:05] <DarsVaeda> +d
[06:38:07] <beancurd> seutje: yeah...
[06:38:26] <seutje> DarsVaeda: not like anybody is dying to get help right now
[06:38:34] <beancurd> or the ones with the slippering thing in the bridge.
[06:38:43] <beancurd> yeah.. hoverboards > jquery
[06:38:44] <seutje> and the last few things were sort of off-topic, all css
[06:39:49] <BillCriswell> I couldn't trust myself with soaps.
[06:46:14] <BillCriswell> decx: Do you use sublime text?
[06:46:57] <decx> i tried but went back to notepad++
[06:47:07] <decx> all i did was draw ascii art in the code preview
[06:47:22] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[06:48:06] <decx> good old █▒░
[06:48:21] <BillCriswell> I keep wanting to use "projects" but I typically end up just dragging over a directory. Just can't break the habit.
[06:49:19] <decx> i ran brackets.io for a week as well
[06:49:42] <BillCriswell> decx: I tried that as well, wasn't too crazy about it.
[06:49:45] <BillCriswell> How about atom?
[06:49:59] <decx> no windows version
[06:50:03] <seutje> sublime has code preview? o.O
[06:50:03] <BillCriswell> Oh.
[06:50:25] <seutje> atom is kinda shitty imo
[06:51:54] <BillCriswell> seutje: It was kind of slow when I tried it.
[06:52:12] <seutje> yeah, and it can't do stuff > 2MB
[06:52:27] <seutje> not to mention the random crashes
[06:52:36] <BillCriswell> I'm not sure HTML/CSS/Javascript is really the best environment for a text editor yet.
[06:52:52] <decx> it cant open big files?
[06:52:57] <seutje> why not?
[06:53:19] <BillCriswell> seutje: It feels slow compared to Sublime Text.
[06:53:21] <decx> i just opened a 50mb exception log with notepad++ in seconds
[06:53:50] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, Atom would not have that.
[06:54:05] <decx> what year is it? 1995?
[06:54:14] <decx> isnt that a solved problem for text editors?
[06:54:40] <seutje> yeah, just not atom
[06:54:45] <decx> hehe
[06:55:20] <BillCriswell> It has some good ideas in there, but it's got a list of things to improve on before I can use it regularly.
[06:55:49] <seutje> sure, but I don't see how that relates to the environment
[06:56:44] <BillCriswell> seutje: I could totally be speaking out of my ass.
[06:56:49] <erming> atom runs webkit, right?
[06:57:13] <BillCriswell> Think so.
[06:57:27] <seutje> chromium
[06:57:31] <BillCriswell> I just updated it and it feels a good bit quicker.
[06:57:32] <erming> i'm running a chat in the browser (webkit too).. lots of rows/divs/whatever = slow
[06:57:33] <seutje> https://github.com/atom/atom-shell
[06:57:42] <decx> well apparently 'run' is an over exaggeration
[06:58:59] <seutje> to what version? 0.85.0 ?
[07:00:13] <BillCriswell> 0.100.0
[07:01:10] <BillCriswell> No idea what I was running before.
[07:02:18] <seutje> lol, can't even figure out how I get this shit to update :x
[07:03:07] <stefancrs> I'm trying to implement appcache for an mobile web app of ours. So far, everything's working fine except that even though on page load, the manifest tells the browser to cache a bunch of pages, and then if we load them through ajax calls, they won't get loaded from cache. unless I reload the page after the cache has finished downloading. what gives?
[07:03:55] <BillCriswell> seutje: Click "Atom" at the top and it'll say what it's doing.
[07:04:10] <BillCriswell> seutje: It started updating automatically for me.
[07:04:24] <seutje> oh, now it is
[07:04:31] <seutje> only had to restart it 3 times :D
[07:04:40] <seutje> now I'll update it and never look at it again
[07:06:22] <BillCriswell> Haha.
[07:07:11] <BillCriswell> Sublime just feels better to me. I can't explain it.
[07:11:06] <seutje> same, but I should prolly get a license for it sometime :P
[07:11:09] <angelryu> \quit
[07:12:33] <BillCriswell> seutje: Agreed. I'm a dead beat as well.
[07:12:44] <BillCriswell> It'd have easily paid for itself 1,000,000 times over by now.
[07:12:54] <BillCriswell> Well... that's a bit much, but at least like 1,000 times.
[07:24:13] <d0de> I just spent an hour trying to work out why some android code wasn't working because I forgot to update the bleeding service name in the bleeding manifest
[07:25:25] <Guest97360> thats the worst
[07:26:10] <d0de> I suppose it's childish of me to blame eclipse...
[07:27:11] <jessica532> is $('abc ul:contains).remove(); valid?
[07:27:25] <tw2113> forgot an end quote
[07:28:13] <BillCriswell> jessica532: What are you hoping to get out of that?
[07:30:07] <decx> it just contains !
[07:30:16] <cam_y_> why does display inline-block elems with 80%-20% width don't work in IE8 ?
[07:30:25] <cam_y_> i guess the border-collapse and margin-collapse ?
[07:30:30] <cam_y_> is there a way to fix it ?
[07:30:42] <BillCriswell> cam_y_: What do you mean "don't work"?
[07:30:43] <decx> because inline-block doesnt exclude whitespace
[07:31:00] <cam_y_> i see only 20% box and the other part is blank
[07:31:01] <decx> so 2 containers 20% and 80% are separated by a literal space
[07:31:19] <cam_y_> literal space .. you mean in the html doc ?
[07:31:38] <decx> yes like the space between the words in this sentence
[07:31:54] <cam_y_> decx: you don't mean &nbsp; right ?
[07:32:01] <decx> doesnt matter
[07:32:17] <stefancrs> not jquery, but wth... this results in "Uncaught InvalidStateError: Failed to execute 'swapCache' on 'ApplicationCache': there is no newer application cache to swap to. ": http://hastebin.com/medomazusu.vhdl
[07:32:22] <r3wt> hi, would this be a good place for me to ask a question about a file upload using the jquery form plugin from malsup.com
[07:33:06] <decx> cam_y_ here's an illustration http://jsfiddle.net/decx/67TzP/
[07:35:02] <cam_y_> decx: that's interesting
[07:35:47] <BillCriswell> Ha, gray and grey work.
[07:36:18] <cam_y_> decx: that works. thanks.. but that's voodooo kindish
[07:37:07] <decx> too bad colour doesnt
[07:37:57] <decx> cam_y_ not really inline-block is meant for that, inline blocks and as such you want to keep the whitespaces
[07:38:13] <decx> like when you have an icon in a sentence or something
[07:38:26] <decx> either float the boat or flexbox that sexbot
[07:39:05] <decx> man that's a tungbreaker
[07:39:12] <decx> tongue*
[07:39:19] <decx> unique new york
[07:39:21] <BillCriswell> tongue breaker?
[07:39:27] <BillCriswell> How now brown cow.
[07:39:32] <decx> isnt that a thing?
[07:39:36] <decx> zungenbrecher in german
[07:39:50] <BillCriswell> "Tongue Twister" is what we typically say.
[07:39:53] <decx> ah
[07:40:27] <BillCriswell> I think our term might make more sense. Wasn't expecting that haha.
[07:41:15] <decx> it's a new cunnilingus technique ^^
[07:42:24] <jessica532> BillCriswell: hey sorry, i wanted to delete the li inside of the ul that is inside of the previous id given that has the contents that would be passed in through contains()
[07:42:40] <jessica532> so like this $('#new-comments-notification ul:contains(' + $projectTitle[j] + ')').remove();
[07:43:25] <BillCriswell> Oh ok. You left out the () part after contains and I was a bit confused.
[07:51:48] <VectorX> hi can anyone tell me how i can add individual title tags to the <circle> elements in this, say if i want to put the country as the title, http://jsfiddle.net/Mep7R/164/
[08:02:47] <iop_> i have an xml file ,im trying to parse the xml with ajax jquery ,however i am not able to figure out how to filter based on attribute value inside an xml,for example : <person>  <job type="engineer"> </person>  i need to get all the engineer job type ,how do i do that?
[08:03:47] <kevin> iop_, job[type='engineer']  should work
[08:04:27] <iop_> @kevin ty will try
[08:44:34] <dylan9o4> oh i hope someone can help with this
[08:44:53] <dylan9o4> this is so annoying
[08:45:06] <duch_kazatel> !ask @ dylan9o4
[08:45:07] <b-ot> dylan9o4: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:45:08] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[08:45:48] <dylan9o4> well it has to do with using a plugin with a custom build of jquery and im getting issues
[08:46:36] <duch_kazatel> what's the custom build, and what's the plugin?
[08:46:49] <duch_kazatel> something tells me your custom build doesn't include everything the plugin needs.
[08:48:37] <dylan9o4> duch_kazatel: http://jsbin.com/masef/2/edit
[08:49:08] <dylan9o4> yea i figured, its just a matter of decyphering exactly what
[08:49:31] <dylan9o4> because the custom build is essential to the page
[08:49:42] <duch_kazatel> what's custom about the build?
[08:50:34] <dylan9o4> idk, i didn't make it. its for the layerslider plugin tho as the comments in the jquery file states
[08:51:15] <duch_kazatel> http://www.phenoral.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js - not seeing any comments in here, and i'm not going to step through it to try to find it.
[08:51:34] <duch_kazatel> anyway, you're trying to use $, when that file has noConflict set.  that means you have to use jQuery.
[08:54:47] <bee_keeper> hi, anyone know of some plugin which binds to a button and giving the user a 'are you sure you want to delete x' when clicked?
[08:55:12] <duch_kazatel> dylan9o4 http://jsbin.com/pegesele/2/edit
[08:55:25] <duch_kazatel> bee_keeper no need for a plugin to do that.
[08:55:34] <bee_keeper> i know it's not hard to make, it's more from a design point of view if i can just drop something in without having to think about how it might look..
[08:56:10] <dylan9o4> duch_kazatel: i apologize for the miscommunication. this is where i cant get it to work
[08:56:12] <dylan9o4> http://jsbin.com/masef/4/edit
[08:56:22] <decx> bee_keeper var really = window.confirm('really?'); if (really){ delete stuff }
[08:56:44] <bee_keeper> decx: yeah i was hoping for something you know, designy
[08:56:54] <bee_keeper> like a little throbber and the button extends or some crap
[08:57:06] <duch_kazatel> dylan9o4 huh?
[08:57:11] <decx> you can emulate confirm with a modal but it's shit imho nothing wrong with using default browser behaviour
[08:57:11] <bee_keeper> if i wanted an alert i'd have done it by now..
[08:57:15] <dylan9o4> duch_kazatel: grr. http://jsbin.com/masef/5/edit
[08:57:32] <duch_kazatel> what's broken there?
[08:58:24] <dylan9o4> duch_kazatel: it says undefined is not a function
[08:58:25] <decx> bee_keeper just google modal confirm there'S about 5 billion
[08:59:00] <duch_kazatel> dylan9o4 document.write is bad bad bad
[08:59:08] <duch_kazatel> but i'm not seeing any console errors.
[08:59:36] <decx> it's not bad, it's just not good
[08:59:49] <duch_kazatel> (i'd rather not be the pedant today ;)
[09:00:02] <decx> like that's going to happen, come on
[09:00:08] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[09:00:12] <duch_kazatel> dylan9o4 http://jsbin.com/fobonebi/1/edit runs fine for me.
[09:02:09] <bee_keeper> decx: right modal confirm, that's the one thanks
[09:24:55] <rogue780> question. I am trying to get the src of an img. The src has a url encoded value such as http://www.example.com/image%20with%20space.png . If I try to grab it with $("#image").attr('src'); It decodes the url to http://www.example.com/image with space.png. Is there a way to make it so it doesn't get automatically decoded?
[09:26:29] <Jattenalle> rogue780, are you sure the img src has those %20's set? i get those just fine in chrome
[09:26:51] <rogue780> Jattenalle, I'll double check
[09:26:57] <Jattenalle> ie: src="test%20derp.jpg" returns 'test%20derp,jpg'
[09:27:25] <duch_kazatel> http://jsfiddle.net/d3z4w/1/
[09:27:28] <duch_kazatel> works fine here, too.
[09:27:41] <rogue780> Jattenalle, you're right. I was completely looking at the wrong part
[09:27:54] <Jattenalle> without the set %20, it'll still work in the <img, but obviously will just be space when you retrieve it
[09:27:57] <Jattenalle> there you go :)
[09:50:50] <sunbeam> say i have a list with icon + title
[09:50:52] <sunbeam> what is the most semantic way to display the icon ?
[09:50:54] <sunbeam> <li class="icon-checked">My title</li> ?
[09:51:18] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Is the icon strictly display purposes?
[09:51:41] <BillCriswell> decx: Do you use Sass?
[09:51:56] <systemfault> Also.. you’re saying “title”, does it mean “<hx>?”
[09:53:29] <sunbeam> BillCriswell:  i thikn so
[09:53:37] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: well actually it means something
[09:53:44] <sunbeam> for example icon-download Download this now
[09:54:14] <BillCriswell> Sounds like it should be more of a button to me at this point.
[09:57:01] <BillCriswell> or a link.
[10:00:38] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: i can just do
[10:00:54] <sunbeam> <li class="icon-download"><a href="#">Download this</a></li>
[10:01:04] <sunbeam> and then set background for the li or a right?
[10:01:48] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: I think it would make more sense on the link.
[10:02:29] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: ok will do
[10:02:39] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: so you think like i want to do this is semantically the best way?
[10:03:16] <BillCriswell> I believe so.
[10:03:40] <sunbeam> ok one more question
[10:04:01] <sunbeam> for a page with a left part where the main text content is, and a right part where a sidebar (including nav) is
[10:04:08] <sunbeam> is the following good semantically wise
[10:04:49] <sunbeam> <main><section class="main-text"><p> some text ..</p></section><section class="sidebar"><nav><ul><li><a href="#">link 1</a></li></nav></section>
[10:05:25] <Kenzi`> https://www.irccloud.com/pastebin/bw0OhgGB
[10:05:38] <Kenzi`> ^ Why is my text not reacting to my hover code in this case?
[10:06:19] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: It can get really picky and depend on the content.
[10:06:24] <BillCriswell> There is an <aside> element.
[10:06:48] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam where is that markup goung to be?
[10:07:00] <duch_kazatel> Kenzi` the html hasn't rendered yet - put your JS after the html, or in a document ready.
[10:07:03] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: a site i have ?
[10:07:04] <softplay> hello
[10:07:18] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam i mean, is that example HTML going to be in the sidebare?  or the main content area?
[10:07:31] <softplay> is this statement $(".boxtab").css( "display", "visible" ); meaningful?
[10:07:51] <softplay> cause it doesn't do what it is expected to do
[10:07:51] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam i ask because you can only have one <main>, and it should only be for the main content of the site, not a nav.
[10:07:53] <duch_kazatel> softplay no.
[10:08:00] <duch_kazatel> softplay "display" has to "visible"
[10:08:05] <softplay> what is wrong with it?
[10:08:17] <duch_kazatel> Visible isn't a valid value for "display"
[10:08:24] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: yes 1 <main> that holds all the "main" content excluding <header> <section class="intro"> and <footer>
[10:08:30] <softplay> so display static should work?
[10:08:34] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam cool, then you're goo.
[10:08:38] <duch_kazatel> *good
[10:08:48] <BillCriswell> Aw yeah.
[10:08:50] <softplay> i'll try
[10:08:52] <duch_kazatel> softplay probably block or inline, depending on what the element was before.
[10:09:14] <duch_kazatel> softplay .show() and .hide() will automate that work for you.
[10:09:39] <sunbeam> then i guess just the usage of <section> is discussable here
[10:09:47] <sunbeam> what should I use <section> def not for ?
[10:09:58] <softplay> i don't know where i read that static was the default value for display
[10:10:13] <duch_kazatel> softplay it depends on the element.
[10:10:17] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6939864/what-is-the-difference-between-section-and-div
[10:10:43] <duch_kazatel> softplay what's the element you're applying this to?
[10:11:04] <BillCriswell> Use <section></section> when all the content is related, use <div></div> when it's not.
[10:11:07] * erming takes a sip of coffee
[10:11:11] <erming> hi guys
[10:11:11] <michaelfillier> having a memory lapse here, I have a var $list = $('a.list'); now I want to select from that existing list the objects with a specific class. I recall using a selector like $($list, '.active') or something like that
[10:11:15] <pnj> http://jsfiddle.net/3qfsJ/1/
[10:11:16] <BillCriswell> I still like that <div> is so short haha
[10:11:34] <pnj> I don't understand the errors when I "jshint" that
[10:11:37] <pnj> any suggestions?
[10:11:37] <duch_kazatel> michaelfillier .filter() would work for that.
[10:11:46] <duch_kazatel> pnj what errors do you get?
[10:11:57] <softplay> duch_kazatel it is only a div
[10:12:08] <duch_kazatel> softplay then it would be display: block;
[10:12:14] <duch_kazatel> unless your CSS set things differently.
[10:12:24] <softplay> yes it works i i've just changed it
[10:12:27] <duch_kazatel> pnj you have an extra quote here - $('p').append(items[i])";
[10:12:32] <pnj> says unmatched {
[10:12:40] <pnj> DAMMINT!!! :D thanks
[10:13:05] <pnj> hahaha. man..
[10:13:12] <michaelfillier> I'll use filter, but I swear there was a simple selector syntax that searches in an existing object list for the selector. It was nice and clean
[10:13:13] <bberry> why does $("#six") no longer contain the div with "maybe..." in it? http://jsfiddle.net/bberry6/whHun/
[10:13:38] <duch_kazatel> michael_benin you're thinking about the .find() style selector.
[10:13:54] <naeluh_friday> yo
[10:13:55] <pnj> I want to <br/> each item in that list. should I add <p> </p> or use <br> inside the existing <p>?
[10:14:04] <michael_benin> duch_kazatel: was that meant for me?
[10:14:05] <duch_kazatel>  $('.active', $list) will basically run $list.find('.active'), michaelfillier
[10:14:14] <duch_kazatel> michael_benin no sorry tab autocomplete fail.
[10:14:16] <BillCriswell> pnj: It's a list, should have list items.
[10:14:30] <duch_kazatel> pnj use a <ul> or <ol>
[10:15:35] <bberry> I thought that .text only changes the text node...
[10:15:45] <pnj> no. it won't be a list when it's done
[10:15:49] <pnj> :)
[10:15:55] <pnj> it will be images
[10:16:07] <pnj> and other items
[10:16:25] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: thanks
[10:16:31] <pnj> i'm just trying to figure out the correct method using a loop. if that makes sense
[10:16:33] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[10:16:57] <duch_kazatel> bberry nope.
[10:17:05] <duch_kazatel> bberry from the docs: "Description: Set the content of each element in the set of matched elements to the specified text."
[10:17:26] <bberry> duch_kazatel hmm. so the only difference between .text and .html is that the string in .html is parsed into html code?
[10:17:34] <duch_kazatel> bberry basically.
[10:17:39] <bberry> interesting...
[10:17:51] <bberry> the more ya know :P
[10:17:51] <duch_kazatel> you can also pass a function to .html()
[10:18:01] <bberry> ah cool
[10:18:08] <bberry> and you cant with text?
[10:18:26] <duch_kazatel> you can as long as it returns a string.
[10:18:28] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: do you maybe know some popular sites that have what i want and utilize html5 tags really well>?
[10:18:29] <bberry> yeah okay
[10:19:19] <duch_kazatel> pnj so which part are you stuck on for that?>
[10:20:16] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: Not sure I follow the question. Like markup for typical types of patterns?
[10:20:52] <duch_kazatel> i think sunbeam is looking for examples of good semantic tag use.
[10:20:55] <sunbeam> BillCriswell: yea just a default site has left column content and right col sidebar
[10:21:29] <michaelfillier> duch_kazatel: thanks, it was even simpler in this case, I just ran $list.removeClass('active'), essentially this was what I wanted to do before highlighting other items in the list. For some reason $list.find('active').removeClass('active') was not working
[10:21:43] <michaelfillier> but $list.removeClass('active') worked
[10:22:12] <duch_kazatel> michael_benin right, because .find() is looking for children of $list
[10:22:18] <duch_kazatel> not for instances of $list
[10:22:42] <michaelfillier> that makes a lot of sense
[10:22:59] <michaelfillier> is there something similar to find that searches siblings?
[10:23:09] <michaelfillier> sorry, instances
[10:23:16] <duch_kazatel> hrm?
[10:23:30] <duch_kazatel> oh, siblings of the current element?
[10:23:31] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: http://pea.rs/ should be able to help a bit?
[10:23:35] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[10:24:20] <BillCriswell> sunbeam: http://bradfrost.github.io/this-is-responsive/patterns.html also a nice resource
[10:24:30] <iHaveAQuestion> Hi. I am trying to roll my own theme with jquery-ui themeroller.  1. I tried entering font 'source sans pro' and an alert shows in the bottom left:''sample uci-state-error style.  2. When I click into the fields  a color wheel pops up but when I navigate to a color and double click it, nothing returns into the field.  Sorry that this is a newbie question. I did a basic search ' jquery' and ' how to roll your own theme' - resu
[10:24:40] <duch_kazatel> iHaveAQuestion - too long.
[10:24:45] <duch_kazatel> got cut off.
[10:24:51] <michaelfillier> no, sorry. I mean, I have a list of instances, I want to search in the list for all items with the class 'active'
[10:24:52] <duch_kazatel> ask each question one at a time :)
[10:25:14] <duch_kazatel> michaelfillier "i have a list of instances" - could you show an example?
[10:25:30] <BillCriswell> michaelfillier: $list.filter('.active') If $list is say a collection of list items.
[10:25:33] <iHaveAQuestion> Okay.how to I get the color wheel to work with 'roll your own theme roller'
[10:25:37] <michaelfillier> var $list = $('a.list')
[10:25:55] <duch_kazatel> michaelfillier yeah, .siblings() will work with that.
[10:25:59] <duch_kazatel> $list.siblings()
[10:26:07] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: BillCriswell: thanks
[10:26:14] <michaelfillier> BillCriswell: okay, let me try
[10:26:31] <duch_kazatel> i'm lost >.>
[10:26:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha.
[10:26:57] <BillCriswell> I jumped in half way I think but it may have worked out in my favor.
[10:27:05] <duch_kazatel> apparently.
[10:27:13] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: they have it in divs :)
[10:27:16] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: sidebar and content
[10:27:23] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam do what now?
[10:27:34] <duch_kazatel> iHaveAQuestion can you link to what you're talking about?
[10:27:57] <sunbeam> duch_kazatel: the link you gave
[10:28:15] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam i didn't link anything...
[10:28:46] <iHaveAQuestion> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/. Thank you.
[10:28:57] <iHaveAQuestion> http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/    Thanks
[10:30:35] <duch_kazatel> iHaveAQuestion which color pickers aren't working?
[10:30:54] <duch_kazatel> aaaaah i see what you're saying.
[10:31:08] <duch_kazatel> looks like themeroller might be broken again.
[10:31:36] <BillCriswell> Damn internet.
[10:32:21] <sunbeam> 19:23 < duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[10:33:04] <iHaveAQuestion> For example I click on 'Content' and pop it down. I click in the background field which has a default of #ffffffff and when I click there a color wheel pops up.  I can move the circle pointer around the color wheel but they will not 'take"
[10:33:27] <duch_kazatel> iHaveAQuestion yeah just said that themeroller might be broken again.
[10:33:36] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam that was for somebody else.
[10:33:44] <duch_kazatel> or wait.  not i'm really lost.
[10:33:48] <duch_kazatel> err, *now
[10:34:45] <duch_kazatel> oh themeroller doesn't work in FireFox.  bummer.
[10:36:17] <sunbeam> lol duch_kazatel
[10:36:18] <sunbeam> ok
[10:36:44] <duch_kazatel> sunbeam yeah that was for pnj re: selecting siblings of elements.
[10:38:30] <iHaveAQuestion> Did you say that theme roller does not work in Firefox ?  The other jquery-ui interactions and effects work from Firefox.
[10:39:14] <duch_kazatel> themeroller, not jqueryui - looks like it might be a little buggy, but i was able to change colors on things just fine after resizing my browser to be wide enough.
[10:40:22] <iHaveAQuestion> I logged out by mistake. The other effects and interactions from jquery-uci work on Firefox.  Are you sure the theme roller does not work?
[10:40:42] <duch_kazatel>  themeroller, not jqueryui - looks like it might be a little buggy, but i was able to change colors on things just fine after resizing my browser to be wide enough.
[10:41:35] <iHaveAQuestion> How did you get the color to change. Exactly ?
[10:42:33] <duch_kazatel> i selected a heading on the left, then clicked the input box for the RGB value.
[10:46:05] <duch_kazatel> iHaveAQuestion http://i.imgur.com/6yDUyFZ.png
[10:47:55] <iHaveAQuestion> Thanks for the graphic.  I do that. Newhart do you do with the color wheel?  I want to use it and find colors that look good together.....making use of the preview that is suppose to show up in the left frame of this window.
[10:48:18] <duch_kazatel> you click to select colors you want.
[10:48:24] <duch_kazatel> then the preview updates.
[10:49:23] <duch_kazatel> the issue you might be having is with that square - make sure you set that to a color that isn't "white"
[10:49:34] <duch_kazatel> move that dot somewhere else and you'll see magic happen.
[10:52:22] <iHaveAQuestion> Duch. Thanks. That did it. I had to move the pointer inside of the square.  Any ideas about how to get the font options to pop up. I tried entering my own and it was rejected with that alert I posted up above.
[10:52:52] <duch_kazatel> i didn't see the alert - what was it?
[10:53:02] <cam_y_> just wanted to confirm. does height in percent work for table-cell ?
[10:53:12] <softplay> if i don't want a form to be submitted do i have to use event.preventDefault(); ?
[10:53:19] <duch_kazatel> softplay yes.
[10:53:24] <softplay> ty
[10:53:30] <duch_kazatel> iHaveAQuestion can you show me what value you wanted to use for font?
[10:53:45] <duch_kazatel> softplay make sure you capture the form's 'submit' event and stop that.
[10:55:12] <iHaveAQuestion> In font I typed 'source sans pro'. Bottom left of frame:Alert ui-state-error style.
[10:56:04] <duch_kazatel> bottom right you mean?
[10:56:07] <duch_kazatel> that's a sample error message.
[10:56:19] <iHaveAQuestion> Yes right.
[10:56:20] <duch_kazatel> http://i.imgur.com/NBKnDT2.png - that thinger?
[10:56:26] <duch_kazatel> that's showing you an example.
[10:57:40] <iHaveAQuestion> I looked at the png.  Still cannot see how to view the font options
[10:57:48] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[10:58:02] <duch_kazatel> you set the font options just fine.
[11:01:37] <iHaveAQuestion> Got it. Thanks. Bye for now.  It was fun.
[11:02:00] <duch_kazatel> well ok
[11:03:36] <BillCriswell> lol
[11:03:42] <Kenzi`> A friend of mine told me I shouldn't be using jqueryui, how am I supposed to make "effects" and whatnot not?
[11:03:48] <Kenzi`> He went afk so he can't help me further :P
[11:03:52] <Kenzi`> now*
[11:04:11] <BillCriswell> What kind of effects?
[11:04:19] <duch_kazatel> Kenzi` by using javascript
[11:04:24] <Kenzi`> f.e. make a button shake when hover it
[11:04:28] <Kenzi`> hovering it*
[11:04:43] <BillCriswell> Kenzi`: What are the browser requirements?
[11:04:48] <duch_kazatel> Kenzi` you can do that with plain old jquery.  are you loading ALL of jquery UI just to get one or two little effects?
[11:05:16] <Kenzi`> yes, but I'm just testing out atm, nothing big
[11:05:25] <Kenzi`> BillCriswell: the standard ones, I guess
[11:05:46] <duch_kazatel> Kenzi` there's no need to load up all of jqueryui if you just need a few effects here and there.
[11:06:42] <Kenzi`> 19:22:06 <Msh100> Yeh dont
[11:06:42] <Kenzi`> 19:22:09 <Msh100> dont learn jquery ui
[11:06:42] <Kenzi`> 19:22:12 <Msh100> it's a waste
[11:06:42] <Kenzi`> 19:22:51 <Msh100> jquery = good
[11:06:42] <Kenzi`> 19:22:55 <Msh100> jquery ui = avoid
[11:07:08] <duch_kazatel> avoid pasting like that.
[11:07:14] <duch_kazatel> i avoid jqueryui personally -  don't need it
[11:07:24] <duch_kazatel> if you can effectively leverage it, then knock yourself out.
[11:07:37] <BillCriswell> Is there a reason they give? If it does what you need why would you avoid it?
[11:08:15] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell same reason i don't automatically add jquery to a page - if i'm not going to make a lot of use of it, why load the entire thing?
[11:08:29] <duch_kazatel> alternatively, just load the bits you need.
[11:08:31] <Kenzi`> It's not particularly doing what I need, and his reason is is that "it looks so 2007"
[11:08:38] <ph88> Kenzi`: go ahead and use jQuery it's really so trivial you can optimized / replace code later
[11:08:51] <duch_kazatel> ph88 they're talking about jqueryUI
[11:09:01] <ph88> Kenzi`: go ahead and use jQuery UI it's really so trivial you can optimized / replace code later
[11:09:02] <duch_kazatel> Kenzi` you can restyle it to your liking.
[11:09:21] <Kenzi`> can I?
[11:09:25] <duch_kazatel> you can also use everything but the styling.
[11:09:28] <Kenzi`> but the same stuff is doable through JS, right?
[11:09:40] <duch_kazatel> yes, and jquery.  jqueryui just makes it easy.
[11:09:48] <Kenzi`> I see
[11:09:51] <BillCriswell> You have to figure out if the juice is worth the squeeze.
[11:09:57] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[11:09:58] <ph88> Kenzi`: don't bother you'll spend a lot of time and it's not worth it to NOT use jQuery UI
[11:10:10] <duch_kazatel> ph88 i disagree with that.
[11:10:15] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I understand that, but I was curious as to this persons reason.
[11:10:21] <duch_kazatel> aaaah, fair enough, BillCriswell
[11:10:26] <Kenzi`> I guess there's no harm in checking where it all comes from
[11:10:34] <decx> BillCriswell not religiously (sass)
[11:10:41] <Kenzi`> Thanks for the input guys
[11:10:58] <duch_kazatel> any time, Kenzi`
[11:11:05] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha yeah I think I lost interest in that.
[11:11:45] <BillCriswell> decx: I wanted to output {% include "foo.css" %} in Sass and the only way I was able to pull it off was through some comment hack.
[11:12:07] <BillCriswell> I wanted to try to make it a function but no luck.
[11:13:00] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: I was getting the "Avoid it at all cost" vibe which is dumb.
[11:13:15] <duch_kazatel> yeah definitely.  it has its time and place.
[11:13:32] <BillCriswell> and the reason "It looks so 2007" confirmed my suspicion that the reason was dumb.
[11:13:33] <duch_kazatel> and saying "it looks like its from 2007" is so 2007 ;)
[11:13:40] <decx> what?
[11:13:48] <decx> oh jquery ui
[11:13:51] <BillCriswell> I never thought "2007" would ever not be the future.
[11:14:37] <decx> i dont even know what i did in 2007
[11:14:57] <ph88> i was taking a nap then
[11:15:10] <duch_kazatel> i was still working nights iirc.
[11:15:13] <BillCriswell> decx: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24082703/escaping-and-in-sass/24085750#24085750 is how I ended up answering it, but it's gross.
[11:17:32] <decx> i have no idea whats going on
[11:19:37] <BillCriswell> I was... coding probably.
[11:20:14] <decx> oh now i get it
[11:20:16] <decx> yikes
[11:30:57] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha yeah.
[11:31:37] <BillCriswell> Easier to follow if I did: $foo: '*/{% whatevr %}/*'; /*#{$foo}*/
[11:32:21] <ezio> i have a form and it has a file .. i'm doing: var formData = new FormData($context.find('form').eq(0)); but it's not getting the file
[11:32:48] <ezio> i'm then doing $.ajax ...
[11:32:50] <Technodrome> can i add an onclick to any button and #id ?
[11:32:58] <ezio> data: formData,
[11:33:01] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome sure can.
[11:33:16] <ezio> anyone know what i'm probably doing wrong?
[11:33:20] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome if the button is for a form, i'd catch the submit event instead.
[11:34:01] <Technodrome> i didn’t want to interfere with the current form action etc duch_kazatel
[11:34:08] <BillCriswell> ezio: What is FormData() expecting? The style of it doesn't look like jQuery so it might request a raw Dom element.
[11:34:20] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome that's not going to interfere.
[11:34:33] <BillCriswell> Why you'd have to do like... var formData = new FormData($context.find('form').eq(0)[0])
[11:34:44] <ezio> oh
[11:35:07] <BillCriswell> ezio: or maybe even just document.forms[0]
[11:35:27] <BillCriswell> Depending on context.
[11:35:57] <ezio> thanks homie!
[11:36:53] <Technodrome> i added a .submit to the class of the form button, but its not catching for some reason
[11:37:20] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome is the form button there on pageload?
[11:37:29] <duch_kazatel> and why can't you just capture the normal form's submit event instead?
[11:37:38] <Technodrome> its jut a normal html form element
[11:37:42] <duch_kazatel> nevermind i'm not going to do this today.
[11:38:01] <Technodrome> i am capturing the normal form submit
[11:38:14] <ezio> is this the karma channel
[11:38:25] <ezio> thanks BillCriswell
[11:38:36] <BillCriswell> No problem. Did it work?
[11:38:39] <ezio> yup
[11:38:42] <BillCriswell> ezio: No, #jquery
[11:38:45] <BillCriswell> ezio: Good shit.
[11:39:21] <Technodrome> $(".form-submit").submit(function(event) {
[11:39:22] <Technodrome> 			alert("there");
[11:39:23] <Technodrome> });
[11:39:28] <ezio> ah there's one channel i went to and they ask you to mention people by name when you're thakning them so the get more karma
[11:39:34] <Technodrome> its just not catching, i mean this is super simple, i’ve doen this alot in prototypejs
[11:39:45] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome does that form exist on pageload?
[11:39:56] <Technodrome> yes
[11:40:07] <duch_kazatel> submit of the form, not the button.
[11:40:10] <duch_kazatel> submit is an event from the form.
[11:40:15] <Technodrome> ah
[11:40:55] <BillCriswell> ezio: Oh, I thought you meant the test tool haha.
[11:41:39] <Technodrome> i added it to the form but still no difference duch_kazatel  hmmm
[11:41:44] <ezio> well you deserve some good karma
[11:43:31] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: can you use the id of the form as the selector? or does that matter?
[11:43:54] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome you can use any selector.
[11:43:58] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery on
[11:44:00] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: .on() | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/on/
[11:44:03] <Technodrome> yeah,
[11:44:06] <duch_kazatel> read that.
[11:44:09] <Technodrome> i was just trying to think why it’s not caching
[11:44:11] <Technodrome> catching
[11:44:41] <duch_kazatel> console.log() the form right before your code to make sure everything is kosher
[11:49:50] <Technodrome> this is straight ridiculous, i’m doing a hide straight on the form, and it’s still visible
[11:50:30] <duch_kazatel> bummer
[11:50:39] <StephenS> yammer
[11:54:32] <Technodrome> $(“html”).hide();   should hide the page right? pretty much?
[11:55:17] <Technodrome> ok that worked, but jesus
[11:58:17] <Technodrome> even if you hide every div , it still works, the only thing it will hide is the html
[11:58:19] <Technodrome> #broken
[12:01:03] <Technodrome> i can’t even hide the body, anything other than html can’t be hidden heh
[12:01:29] <BillCriswell> Technodrome: Validate your HTML.
[12:02:30] <Technodrome> tons of errors
[12:02:33] <Technodrome> i didn’t make this though
[12:02:43] <BillCriswell> I'm not judging.
[12:03:12] <Technodrome> yes, i mean i didn’t want to radicaly change the html might mess up something else or some working JS
[12:03:13] <Technodrome> but dang
[12:03:50] <decx> hide html? the fuck?`
[12:06:02] <Technodrome> when i open the console and type $ , it says undefined
[12:06:12] <duch_kazatel> noconflict is probably turned on.
[12:06:15] <duch_kazatel> try jQuery
[12:06:29] <duch_kazatel> or you don't have jquery even loaded.
[12:08:21] <Technodrome> then how would $(“html”).hide(); work ?
[12:09:44] <Technodrome> i just did a getElementById of the form id , and it says its null
[12:11:07] <Technodrome> even bare javascript can’t access the element
[12:11:41] <Technodrome> JQuery
[12:11:42] <Technodrome> ReferenceError: JQuery is not defined
[12:15:07] <MikeD_> $(this).parent().parent().find('.UOMContainer').hide(); <-- there's a smarter way to write this, right?
[12:19:39] <brunoaiss> MikeD_, define: smarter way to write
[12:20:14] <MikeD_> $(this).parents('.UOMContainer').hide();
[12:20:18] <brunoais> tuoir, stop that!
[12:20:44] <MikeD_> the .parent().parent() is kinda fragile.  i just broke that functionality by adding a wrapping element in the markup
[12:21:02] <brunoais> MikeD_, .closest('.UOMContainer')
[12:21:03] <brunoais> ?
[12:21:27] <MikeD_> thanks, i knew there had to be a solution but didn't know how to search for it
[12:21:44] <brunoais> MikeD_, I took that from memory :S
[12:21:50] <brunoais> and I don't even use jQuery much
[12:22:06] <MikeD_> all i need is a crumb + google (and tias)
[12:22:37] <duch_kazatel> Technodrome is the element in a fragment?
[12:23:01] <Technodrome> duch_kazatel: its just straight fucked man, no lie
[12:23:13] <Technodrome> i can’t even pull things out via a simple JS call
[12:23:18] <duch_kazatel> probably not, but OK.
[12:23:21] <Technodrome> i can do it in the browser but not in the file
[12:24:21] <Technodrome> everything document.getElementById return a null
[12:24:25] <Technodrome> every time
[12:24:47] <brunoais> Technodrome, that means that there's no element with that ID in that document
[12:25:12] <brunoais> Technodrome, what's the ID of the element you are trying to get and what is the string you are trying to use?
[12:29:55] <haemly> Does anybody know how with using JQuery Mobile, I can set a specfic width, lets say: 500px by 500px, to be my content area? instead of it defaulting to be 100% of screen?
[12:38:31] <BillCriswell> haemly: Not super familiar with jQuery mobile but would just setting the width and height on the body work?
[12:39:13] <BillCriswell> ajpiano: Just a heads up, tuoir is spamming.
[12:39:53] <haemly> BillCriswell: If only.. If only..
[12:42:16] <BillCriswell> haemly: Lots of hard coded widths in there?
[12:42:35] <BillCriswell> haemly: http://jsbin.com/kiniyera/1/edit?html,css,output is essentially what I was thinking.
[12:42:43] <haemly> BillCriswell: I overrode the min-height/min-width
[12:42:46] <haemly> and it worked
[12:42:53] <BillCriswell> Ah good stuff.
[12:43:24] <haemly> was just trying to overide height/width and it was driving me crazy
[13:03:41] <paulvd> jQuery(window).bind("load", function() { will run after the entire html of the page has been loaded along with the images ?
[13:06:17] <jessica532> I think the functionality i'm building has too many arrays
[13:08:04] <BillCriswell> paulvd: You probably want $(window).on('load', function () { ... });
[13:08:42] <BillCriswell> jessica532: What leads you to think that?
[13:12:04] <systemfault> paulvd: Yes, this is why nobody uses that event anymore.
[13:13:20] <jessica532> BillCriswell: because their values are based on each other and they serve similar purposes but not exactly the same. Thinking of maybe switching to an object
[13:13:20] <systemfault> BTW, if an op is here… there’s a POS sending links in private.
[13:13:42] <vladikoff> systemfault, wat
[13:13:46] <naschine> Point of sale?
[13:13:51] <systemfault> Piece of Shit.
[13:14:03] <BillCriswell> tuoir send me one.
[13:14:03] <naschine> lol, just as I wrote that I got a message
[13:14:07] <BillCriswell> sent*
[13:14:24] <BillCriswell> Why the hell would you spam in here is my big question?
[13:14:40] <naschine> tuoir spams solo shows or something?
[13:14:40] <vladikoff> systemfault, just mute or w/e
[13:14:52] <paulvd> BillCriswell: I am doing that, it works in fiddle but not in the live site
[13:14:55] <systemfault> naschine: Yeah.. didn’t bother clicking on the link
[13:15:16] <naschine> me neither, but it's what I understood from the link xD
[13:15:26] <BillCriswell> jessica532: You can't really just switch one for the other. You might want an array of objects. It all depends.
[13:15:27] <systemfault> ajpiano: Yo. Sorry to disturb you, there’s an asshole to kick on the channel.
[13:15:50] <paulvd> if you click on the appointment here http://tinyurl.com/lsytp28, you will see the first dropdown box, i am trying to set that value using jquery
[13:17:03] <BillCriswell> paulvd: $('#birs_appointment_location').val('1321')
[13:17:21] <jessica532> BillCriswell: yeah, i'll just stick with the arrays i guess
[13:17:56] <BillCriswell> jessica532: It really depends on the task at hand which data structure you should use.
[13:20:57] <jessica532> BillCriswell: might have been easier if i started with API
[13:21:04] <jessica532> but would have to learn how 2 api lol
[13:23:43] <t4nk585> how will i write a for statement for this (First mile: £3  Every mile afterwords: £1.60/mile)
[13:25:47] <paulvd> BillCriswell: I want to set the option according to the text and not value
[13:26:11] <paulvd> jQuery("#birs_appointment_location option").filter(function() { return this.text == name; }).attr('selected', true);
[13:26:13] <paulvd> I used this
[13:26:33] <paulvd> I used this >> http://jsfiddle.net/KCS8k/
[13:26:40] <BillCriswell> paulvd: Got ya.
[13:33:04] <BillCriswell> jessica532: Not sure I'm following you. Are you working with a particular API?
[13:33:53] <dllama> hey guys, i'm having an issue with ajax and global: false.  using .blockUI and unblockUI as default ajax start/stop actions.  I have an ajax call that takes a while to process, but the overall function actually has 2 ajax calls in it.  I'm trying to have the UI blocked (via $.blockUI) until the success of the secondary ajax call.  my code is here: https://gist.github.com/mvoloz/439f8d9b8e0184e3de53
[13:34:13] <dllama> any help would be greatly appreciated!
[13:36:42] <BillCriswell> t4nk585: if (arr.length) { total = 3 + ( arr.length - 1 ) * 1.60; });

[14:03:31] <devt204> i need to write a for loop , for this condition how do i write Normal car:
[14:03:31] <devt204> First mile: £3
[14:03:32] <devt204> Every mile afterwords: £1.60/mile
[14:15:31] <Azrael_-> hi
[14:16:01] <dllama> can anyone please help me out with getting global: false to work with  2 ajax requests.
[14:16:09] <dllama> https://gist.github.com/mvoloz/439f8d9b8e0184e3de53
[14:16:49] <Azrael_-> i'm using jquery-ui to display a popup but also running bootstrap. now the close-button is just an empty button without styling. can you give me a hint how to solve this?
[14:27:51] <doug65536m> anyone know how to look at the js console on android browser?
[14:28:49] <Azrael_-> *solved*
[14:29:21] <doug65536m> my site fails on android and I have no way to see why without a console
[14:33:45] <ngharo> doug65536m: does it also fail on chrome for android?
[14:42:50] <usrb1n> Hello guys. I am trying to build an user side
[14:43:00] <usrb1n> notification for a website
[14:44:29] <jessica532> ...
[14:44:58] <usrb1n> Sorry, almost run out of battery.
[14:45:32] <usrb1n> So I am trying to personalize the notification for a website. I have checked Firefox console and everytime a notification is sent there is a GET on the console to a 1px image
[14:45:58] <usrb1n> Is there any function to grab that ? Like... listen and when a link is called do something
[14:45:58] <jessica532> $projectCount = []; function x() { for(var i = 0; i < differentValueIndexes.length; ++i) { $projectCount[i] += 1; } }   // console says $projectCount[i] is undefined wtf
[14:46:22] <usrb1n> I know about jquery GET and POST  but afaik those are to actually do a post or a get. Not to listen when one is made
[14:53:35] <Azrael_-> usrb1n: those calls are probably ajax-calls. also most often done using frameworks. e.g. jquery. if you can find out how they are done you could try to hook them
[14:54:59] <usrb1n> Azrael_-: Thank you. Those are actually 99% like facebook notification style. A box appears for few seconds and then dissapears. That call is the only thing I've saw it's always repeated.
[14:55:22] <usrb1n> I guess I should use some other tools to check what happens when a notification popsup
[14:55:39] <Azrael_-> i love firebug for this

[15:33:19] <Vocino> Anyone up for helping me with this owlCarousel thing?  https://gist.github.com/vocino/5e3d23a0e68c3fd56d39  I'm trying to place these items into the carousel system but I can't seem to figure out how to get it in.  There is a custom JSON demo but it's not 100% helpful, http://www.owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/demos/customJson.html
[15:40:54] <sunbeam> hi, i'd like to know if there exists any .scss file that contains a lot recommended mixins
[15:40:57] <sunbeam> anyone knows?
[15:41:39] <systemfault> compass?
[16:22:10] <il> parseFloat($("#my_id").text().replace(/$|-/,""),10); is returning NaN. id value can be something like $4 or -$5. What is wrong with my regex?
[16:42:29] <ornerymoose> I have some data in a django application and I need to set up a filter for just shipment.Status (line 43). I'm a bit confused as where to start/what jquery method(s) to use. Itll just be a simple drop down menu where you can click on a status (ie submitted, not submitted) and the results will be appropriately shown. Would someone mind offering some insight as to where I should start? http://codeshare.io/LO5UY
[16:51:50] <romangineer> ornerymoose filtering tables is pretty common, I imagine there's a widget/plugin that'll consume the table and do that for you
[16:53:25] <asdfuken> Nmsg NickServ identify silver1
[16:53:33] <asdfuken> exit
[16:53:35] <romangineer> I've used jqGrid for something like that before, but that's a pretty powerful plugin, may be overkill for what you want
[16:53:50] <ornerymoose> yeah seems like theres a ton of plugins
[16:54:28] <ornerymoose> gotcha. Ill check it out. Like you said what im trying to accomplish is pretty simple in the big picture, just not trying to overwhelm myself in the process
[17:00:55] <DMGD> Good day
[17:01:32] <romangineer> :-)
[17:03:43] <DMGD> I'm lost trying to use data-name in a selector.
[17:05:46] <romangineer> the attribute?
[17:06:36] <DMGD> yes
[17:07:22] <DMGD> $("#some_id").remove(); I want to use a data-... for the id
[17:08:03] <romangineer> you want to take the value that is in the data-name attribute, and find the element with that same value as an id?
[17:08:42] <DMGD> Yes
[17:12:20] <romangineer> I'm thinking that you would need the value of data-name first, before you could build the selector you need
[17:13:23] <romangineer> I can't think of a way to build the id selector, where the id depends on finding the value of data-name attribute in another element
[17:14:41] <romangineer> $("#"+$("myelem").attr("data-name")) like that
[17:15:33] <DMGD> I'll git it a try
[17:15:45] <DMGD> Thanks!!
[17:16:16] <romangineer> welcome
[17:22:48] <dllama1> can anyone please help me out with getting global: false to work with  2 ajax requests. https://gist.github.com/mvoloz/439f8d9b8e0184e3de53
[17:23:31] <dllama> hm, why is it that everytimei  try to paste a gist link, i get a msg from tuoir
[17:24:19] <dllama> its not exactly coherent, so i'm not sure if its notifying me of a mistake or what it is
[17:26:03] <DMGD> romangineer Thanks again.  That worked.  My problem was I should have put it in the remove()
[17:54:13] <shoelessone> Any chance anybody here has any good FREE mobile friendly, modern (I don't need <= IE8 support), simple, and fast graphing libraries?
[17:54:25] <shoelessone> I need relatively simple graphs only, nothing too fancy
[17:54:34] <shoelessone> but I want fast, and mobile friendly/responsive
[17:55:12] <dllama> can anyone please help me out with getting global: false to work with  2 ajax requests.
[17:55:46] <dllama> i have a gist of my code, but anytime i paste it here, i get a msg from tuoir with a link to something
[17:56:24] <shoky> dllama: he's spamming?
[17:56:43] <dllama> is that what it is? only came a sec after i posted a link to gist,
[17:56:46] <dllama> so i thought it was a weird bot
[17:56:52] <shoky> probably. what did he msg?
[17:57:07] <Jattenalle> been a few of those going around lately, spambots that is
[17:57:12] <shoky> yup
[17:57:14] <dllama> show gratis (solo hooy) --> http://s422803032.mialojamiento.es/
[17:57:17] <shoky> yeah
[17:57:18] <dllama> no idea wtf that means
[17:57:22] <Jattenalle> yeah that's spam
[17:57:25] <dllama> lovely
[17:57:26] <dllama> lol
[17:58:31] <shoky> dllama what's the problem with global: false? it's still triggering your ajaxStart/ajaxStop ?
[17:58:33] <dllama> https://gist.github.com/mvoloz/439f8d9b8e0184e3de53 — thast the code i'm having trouble with.  I do have global:false part of teh ajax call, but it still performs ajaxStop its done fully processing everything
[17:58:37] <faddah> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sONfxPCTU0
[17:59:37] <dllama> the transsparent_redirect function takes a little while (maybe 5-7 seconds) because it makes a secondary api call to my token vault provider, so before thats even finished processing, $.unblockUI is triggered
[18:01:44] <dllama> just tested again, just about a 7 second different
[18:03:54] <shoky> dllama: you have $.blockUI.defaults.timeout = 1000;
[18:04:38] <shoky> "time in millis to wait before auto-unblocking"
[18:05:21] <dllama> going to ram my head into the wall if thats the culprit lol
[18:06:25] <dllama> shoky: THANK YOU VERY MUCH!
[18:06:34] <dllama> really hate myself for that right now
[18:06:36] <shoky> np ;]
[18:13:36] <dllama> is it possible to add global:false into $.post rather than .ajax?
[18:14:00] <dllama> like the shortened version of $.post over .ajax
[18:36:38] <wa5ted> will anyone entertain a git question
[18:39:11] <derrida> for some reason, when i load jquery mobile, my desktop safari no longer obeys <input autofocus>
[18:39:58] <derrida> but it works fine with chrome
[18:46:52] <wkmanire> Are callbacks set with .done() immediately called if a deferred has already been resolved?
[18:53:53] <dave_2> hello
[19:01:46] <MACscr> am i going about this the wrong way? http://jsfiddle.net/GMec9/
[19:02:06] <MACscr> i think my main issue is the load_here var
[19:02:47] <MACscr> crap, just a sec
[19:02:52] <MACscr> forgot to load the library. lol
[19:03:17] <MACscr> lol, nvm
[19:03:19] <MACscr> that was the issue
[19:07:52] <dave_2> i need to create a condition based on user selection if user select normal for the first mile price should be 3£ and after every mile price should  £1.60/mile and minimum fare: 15£ how i create such condition
[19:13:52] <dave_2> anyone here
[19:30:53] <Technodrome> so i have an onclick on a form submit button, it fires an ajax post
[19:31:03] <Technodrome> but it keeps getting cacelled by i guess the actual form post?
[19:32:44] <Technodrome> this is driving me nuts, i’m alright there but its getting cacelled
[19:33:19] <MACscr> Technodrome: you need to disable the default event
[19:33:26] <Technodrome> default event?
[19:33:37] <MACscr> google it
[19:33:39] <Technodrome> the normal html form post?
[19:33:42] <MACscr> yep
[19:34:15] <MACscr> http://api.jquery.com/event.preventdefault/
[19:34:18] <Technodrome> sometimes it works sometimes it doesnt
[19:34:27] <Technodrome> 1 wont’ 2 will 3 won’t 4th will
[19:34:31] <Technodrome> pattern keeps working
[19:35:02] <Technodrome> the pattern is too perfect heh
[19:35:31] <Technodrome> i think its just a straight html form though
[19:46:37] <shoky> Technodrome: handle the form's submit event, not the button's click event
[19:46:54] <Technodrome> i’m trying to do 2 form submits at once
[19:47:00] <shoky> wat
[19:47:02] <Technodrome> they submit to differnet places, one to a remote server
[19:47:04] <Technodrome> yes its nuts i know
[19:47:07] <Technodrome> its crazy beyond belief
[19:47:31] <shoky> you mean 2 ajax requests?
[19:47:39] <Technodrome> no
[19:47:42] <Technodrome> one real form post
[19:47:44] <Technodrome> another ajax
[19:47:57] <shoky> real form post will redirect the page
[19:48:08] <Technodrome> breaking the ajax post right shoky ?
[19:48:12] <Vorspire> or dynamically cahnge the action attribute of the form before each submit
[19:48:19] <shoky> very likely, Technodrome yes
[19:48:25] <Technodrome> exactly what was happening
[19:48:40] <Technodrome> so my ghetto self, put it on the form buttons hover event, which does work, but is ghetto
[19:48:42] <shoky> then you do not want to do this
[19:48:59] <Technodrome> believe me, this is not what i intended to be doing , by any stretch
[19:49:21] <shoky> should've followed your intentions, then :P
[19:50:26] <Technodrome> believe me
[19:50:29] <Technodrome> its an old java app
[19:50:50] <Technodrome> things are not being put into the db right , orders, so i was trying to just pull them and post them somewhere else
[19:51:34] <shoky> righto.
[19:52:22] <Technodrome> shoky: which has turned into a freaking nightmare
[19:52:24] <Technodrome> thats about to end
[19:52:46] <shoky> sorry for your woes. maybe if you ask a question we can help you
[19:52:46] <Technodrome> its so ghetto, the ajax post fires quick when its on the on hover, so in reality the redirect woudln’t be able to stop it in time probably
[19:52:48] <Technodrome> so ghetto
[19:53:04] <shoky> cause reading about your ghetto excursions is getting noone anywhere
[19:53:08] <Technodrome> i can’t edit the code, its a compiled java app
[19:53:22] <Technodrome> oh shoky come on , i thought you understood, there is nothing more i can do this for app
[19:53:38] <shoky> didn't i say i'm sorry for your woes?
[19:54:32] <shoky> what else can i do, when you say "believe me, it needs to be ghetto"
[19:54:40] <shoky> or at least that's the gist i'm getting
[19:56:17] <Technodrome> shoky: i just need to go drink some water
[19:56:23] <Technodrome> and tell them, they need to get the source code
[21:38:01] <jayne> one sec
