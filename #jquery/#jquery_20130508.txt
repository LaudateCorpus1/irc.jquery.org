[00:00:17] <Cork> marandi: did you run $('input[type="text"]').length in the code where you did the addClass call?
[00:00:24] <Cork> that is console.log($('input[type="text"]').length)
[00:00:44] <marandi> Cork: actually i just want to change #username border ! and no i run it in ff web console
[00:00:56] <Cork> run it in code then
[00:01:02] <marandi> Cork: ok
[00:01:04] <marandi> let me check
[00:01:08] <Cork> i suspect you run it before the elements exist in the page
[00:02:03] <Cork> and if if it still returns 15, create a pb of the code see ?p
[00:02:04] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/

[00:03:11] <bot-t> coldhead, BOOMA DOOMA (repeat 4 times)
[00:03:22] <coldhead> can do little buddy
[00:05:34] <marandi> Cork: got 0 in  the answer , its weird ! what do u think ?
[00:05:46] <Cork> is this running when the page loads?
[00:05:55] <Cork> or is it using animations?
[00:06:01] <Cork> ajax?
[00:06:51] <Jac0bz1> Anyone knows why $(document).on('keyup', ... dont work in fullscreen mode (HTML5) ?
[00:07:13] <Cork> you mean the requestFullscreen mode?
[00:07:40] <Jac0bz1> yes
[00:07:43] <marandi> Cork: no i use on document.ready , but something is really confusing , because in document.ready it wont wory , so i just loaded in js file !
[00:08:03] <Cork> marandi: so the pb then
[00:08:19] <marandi> Cork: what do u mean ?
[00:08:27] <Cork> ?p
[00:08:28] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:08:53] <Cork> Jac0bz1: the element is moved out of the dom, so might be it doesn't bubble outside the element you ran requestFullscreen on
[00:09:10] <Cork> but haven't checked that my self so i'm mainly guessing there
[00:09:27] <Qdest> Did fiddle just go down?
[00:09:44] <Cork> ?down jsfiddle.net
[00:09:51] <bot-t> Cork, It's not just you! - http://jsfiddle.net looks down from here.
[00:09:53] <Cork> yup...
[00:11:19] <marandi> Cork: check it out : https://gist.github.com/rezamarandi/5538777 , and do u need my view file too ?
[00:11:55] <Cork> marandi: what is adding the fields?
[00:12:07] <Jac0bz1> Cork: http://pastebin.com/77uXRFvR as you can see, I dont think it has to do with elements moving out of DOM
[00:12:30] <marandi> Cork: im sorry , what do u mean ?
[00:12:34] <b-ot> Cork: It's just you. http://jsfiddle.net is up! (200 OK)
[00:12:41] <Cork> <_<
[00:12:48] * Cork slaps b-ot
[00:12:59] <Qdest> Well, I've selected all <img/> in a specific element. Now I've done .each() on it, and inside here I am creating a <li/> for each <img/> found. But I'm trying to give the li's a data-bg attribute with the <img/> href value, without any luck. This is what I am trying: $('ul', footer).append('<li/>').attr('data-fan-bg', $(this).attr('href'));
[00:13:05] <Cork> marandi: the input fields you're looking for where are they added?
[00:13:17] <Qdest> However, it targets the <ul> instead of each <li>
[00:13:21] <alex88> hi guys, how do I edit a field on a form? I've tried running serializeArray and then edit the value, but to put it back to serialized way to submit via ajax?
[00:13:42] <Cork> Qdest: move the html into it's own $()
[00:13:55] <marandi> Cork: in my view file , ( i use MVC ) and i add this branch.js to that view file because gmap work just great !
[00:14:11] <coldhead> because gmap work just great, indeed
[00:14:14] <coldhead> truer words
[00:14:15] <Cork> alex88: just give ajax the serializeArray array
[00:14:43] <Cork> marandi: uh... the question is where it gets added in the code flow; ready is prob too soon
[00:14:45] <alex88> Cork: oh it work fine that way too? nice to know, I thought I should have it serialized as string.. thanks man!
[00:15:06] <Cork> marandi:  and i need a working demo to be able to see that, not a dead dump
[00:15:15] <Qdest> Cork Â» how do you mean the HTML into it's own $() ? So I'm inside this each thing to create the <li>'s. And then how would I move the HTML to its own $()?
[00:15:45] <Cork> aleksandar: ajax can take a params string, an key:value pare object, and an array of objects (what serializeArray gives you)
[00:15:52] <Cork> *alex88:
[00:15:55] <marandi> Cork: wow , thats a little bit hard , because i have to upload about 100 files so u would see the view file !
[00:16:14] <Cork> marandi: ok, check where the input fields gets added
[00:16:23] <Cork> it's most likely in some form of ajax callback
[00:16:35] <Cork> you need to hook into that callback to be able to access them
[00:16:44] <alex88> Cork: I knew about the key:value and serialize() return, but not serializeArray, thanks a lot!
[00:17:48] <marandi> Cork: check out this file , its the view file
[00:18:05] <Cork> marandi: sorry i can't get the info i need from that file
[00:18:18] <Cork> you will have to dig up where it gets added
[00:18:35] <marandi> Cork: the branch.js ?!
[00:19:07] <Cork> marandi: locate where the input files gets added then follow the chain and see if its a callback or what it is
[00:19:19] <marandi> Cork: branch.js added at last after loading jquery , plugins and other files
[00:19:22] <Cork> it might be from google map or something
[00:19:44] <Cork> you're thinking synchronously, and that is why it fails
[00:19:49] <Cork> something is makeing it async
[00:19:50] <fabioportieri> morning
[00:20:10] <marandi> Cork: alright , but i didnt add them with ajax , its fix right there
[00:22:15] <marandi> Cork: hey , brain storm , is it okay that i use document.ready in two separate file and include that files in my view ?
[00:22:48] <Cork> yes
[00:23:09] <marandi> Cork: i dunno know what it wont work so :(
[00:23:25] <Cork> like i said something is making it async
[00:24:30] <marandi> Cork: i cant get it what do u mean by async

[01:05:21] <ThoMe> hiho!
[01:08:09] <Guddu> Can a Ajax submit fetch a response of mimetype='application/vnd.ms-excel'
[01:08:23] <Cork> no
[01:08:56] <Cork> data that would have triggered a download action in the browser can't be fetched through ajax
[01:10:13] <Guddu> Thanks Cork
[01:11:46] <motaka3> cork, there seems to be a problem using getScript, I get somescripts using that function and right after I get some html code need those scripts, but it seems that I first get the HTML and the needing scripts, how can I avoid this ?
[01:12:25] <Cork> motaka3: if you fetch the html and the js at the same time it is a gamble witch one you get first
[01:13:11] <Cork> there is three ways around it, 1. make the second call when one has finished
[01:13:24] <Cork> 2. combine them into one call (i would prefer that my self)
[01:13:28] <Cork> 3. make the calls but don'
[01:13:54] <Cork> but run it when both has been grabbed
[01:14:44] <Guddu> Cork, My issue is that without ajax, the excel file gets generated and downloaded just fine. But at times there are errors. I am using JQuery modal popup to show those errors in Ajax model in other parts of the application but since excel download will be without ajax, is there a way to get those error message shown to the user? How will i make the values return when my mimetype is 'application/vnd.ms-excel' for that call? Basically it boils down to auto
[01:14:44] <Guddu> matically detecting content type on JS side?
[01:15:13] <Cork> Guddu: iframe?
[01:15:56] <Cork> hmm or you could string the data and trigger a save from the page
[01:16:07] <Cork> it would mean the data would have to be cached in the page; but it should be possible
[01:16:19] <Cork> haven't actually labbed with it though
[01:16:38] <Cork> but ya downloads is tricky to get right
[01:17:37] <Qdest> Cork Â» http://jsfiddle.net/5sJg7/ <-- could you take a quick look and see what I could do to make line 9 'work'?
[01:18:12] <motaka2> Cork: What about me ?
[01:18:49] <Cork> Qdest: you're doing the same mistake again
[01:18:54] <Cork> append returns ul not li
[01:19:58] <Cork> Qdest: http://jsfiddle.net/5sJg7/1/
[01:20:23] <Cork> motaka2: i already gave you a long response...
[01:20:41] <Jac0bz1> Sorry for repeating myself, but I'm going crazy here. jQuery(document).on('keydown', function(e) { console.log('foo'); }); don't work when in fullscreen ( webkitRequestFullScreen)
[01:20:57] <Qdest> Cork Â» thanks a lot!
[01:21:05] <motaka2> Cork: I dont know what your response was
[01:21:40] <Cork> motaka2: if you do an ex. .load(url) and a .getScript(url) call, you have absolutely no clue who will be loaded first
[01:22:09] <Cork> so you need to use one of the three options i gave you
[01:22:13] <motaka2> so what should I do ?
[01:22:24] <Cork> ... read the responses to you're question?
[01:22:47] <motaka2> Please give those three options to me once again
[01:23:19] <Cork> just scroll up i gave it 9 mins ago...
[01:24:34] <motaka2> Cork: I did, I cant see them
[01:24:42] <jangoh> can anyone show me example how to validate end date start date and custom message?
[01:24:50] <Cork> it starts at "<Cork> motaka3: if you fetch the html and the js at the same time it is a gamble witch one you get first"
[01:24:57] <Cork> and ends at "<Cork> but run it when both has been grabbed"
[01:31:01] <motaka2> Cork: there is something wrong with my client I cant see it

[01:35:33] <motaka2> Cork: Thanks how can I combine them all in one request ?
[01:35:56] <Cork> motaka2: out he html as an escaped javascript string?
[01:36:03] <Cork> or put the js as a script tag in the html
[01:36:29] * Cork wish ajax could handle multipart
[01:37:02] <motaka2> Cork: there must be better ways
[01:37:14] <Cork> motaka2: to combine; no
[01:37:23] <Cork> the other option is the other two i gave you
[01:49:51] <motaka2> Cork: What do you think of this solution ?  http://pastebin.com/U9Tq1kV1
[01:50:45] <Cork> that is it's quite ugly and has loads of buggy situations and racy...
[01:51:38] <Cork> and as if that wasn't enough... it uses syncronous ajax calls....
[01:51:50] <Cork> so change is from ugly to horrible
[01:53:19] <motaka2> Would you please give me a code sample base on mine? cause I dont get what the best solution is according to u
[01:53:55] <Cork> i've already said how to solve it in a not horrible way
[01:54:03] <Cork> and you don't like those
[01:54:34] <motaka2> Cork: I actually dont understand them
[01:54:37] <Cork> the number one problem i have with the code is that you pull x number of css files into the page
[01:54:56] <motaka2> Cork: So what should I do ?
[01:55:13] <Cork> 1. send javascript that adds the html, and have the html inline in the js response
[01:55:26] <Cork> or 2. send html with the js either linked in the html, or inlined in the html
[01:55:39] <Cork> those are the two simplest ways to solve it
[01:55:56] <Cork> for the css part, create one css file server side, and not 100000+ css files for each page
[01:56:50] <seutje> as a side note: if $('#main') always references the same element, evaluate it once and store the result
[01:57:02] <motaka2> Cork: Untill i calla apge i dont know what css files it needs
[01:57:25] <seutje> kinda silly to search the DOM for the same element over and over in a loop when you know it won't change
[01:57:29] <Cork> motaka2: cause you expect to load the css as the pages are loaded
[01:57:32] <Cork> that is the prolem
[01:57:34] <Cork> *problem
[01:57:59] <Cork> there is no need to load the css like that, make one css file and use classes (like i said yesterday)
[01:58:16] <motaka2> Cork: I dont know - the program is previousely developped and we really dont know what css will be needed in an action
[01:58:24] <anli> Is there a way to check how many lines the text inside a div takes up?
[01:58:25] <Cork> seutje: it is an id though so you don't really search the dom
[01:58:27] <seutje> yeah, body classes are the shit
[01:58:58] <seutje> Cork: still needs to detect it's an ID and even though getElementById is fast, it's still silly to re-query
[01:59:06] <Cork> anli: no, not really, you will have to do some estimation, only option
[01:59:22] <seutje> and I meant it as a general rule of thumb
[01:59:25] <anli> All I want to know is if it breaks the text once
[01:59:31] <Cork> seutje: it takes more time then cached yes, but it's not at all a dom search
[01:59:39] <anli> Maybe I can just put an M there, measure it and then put the actual text in it and compare
[01:59:50] <Cork> its as much a dom search as jqvar.eq(10)
[02:00:00] <seutje> I guess
[02:00:57] <seutje> it just shows he doesn't rly care, and maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but one of these days, there's gonna be an ugly selector in there
[02:01:23] <Cork> there is already tons of ugliness in there
[02:02:04] <Cork> enough so that i would full heartily just drop the code form the tree if i saw something like that in a project i had
[02:03:22] <seutje> I don't even fully understand what it's suppose to do... I think
[02:03:30] <Cork> (and yes that would mean breaking the site, but the one pushing that would have to fix it, and i would veto to check it before he commits anything in the future...)
[02:03:53] <Cork> its sync in loops in an async ajax call
[02:04:08] <Cork> with highly likely conflicting css files constantly pulled into the page
[02:04:24] <seutje> every time I click any link, it's gonna replace some html with a loding image, then it'll lock up the browser waiting for this POST without any data to respond
[02:04:36] <Cork> it has a really high risk of weird bugs in unrelated and hard to reproduce ways
[02:04:50] <Cork> yuck
[02:05:24] <Cork> user reports that the page looks weird, when you check it looks fine
[02:05:25] <seutje> then it'll spin off a potentially ridiculous number of ajax calls for scripts that don't really require a callback and could just be dropped in a script tag?
[02:05:29] <seutje> that about right?
[02:05:35] <Cork> cause you need to visit x other sites for the bug to show
[02:05:42] <Cork> that too
[02:06:05] <Cork> and if the server for some reason dies the users browser will hang more or less indefinitely
[02:06:51] <seutje> impossibru!
[02:07:16] <seutje> I'd just blame the sysadmin and call it a day
[02:25:59] <Bish> hi, im trying to automate a task where a statistic of each day of the month is selected and put out by a farm
[02:26:22] <Bish> so im trying $.post($('form').attr('action'),$('form').serialize())
[02:26:50] <Bish> it tells me, that the page is 404 non-existent, can the server disquinwish between "normal" requests and xhr reuests?
[02:27:06] <Bish> distinguish*
[02:27:47] <Cork> Bish: have you verified in the console that it tries to connect to the correct url?
[02:28:04] <Bish> yep, when i press the "submit" button, it shows me the exact same url
[02:28:20] <Cork> and the post data you see there is the same?
[02:28:24] <Bish> yep
[02:28:35] <Cork> then yes it uses the ajax header
[02:28:47] <Bish> can i get around that?
[02:31:22] <Cork> Bish: you could try replacing the X-Requested-With header
[02:31:46] <Bish> okay, i just see, it doesn't send the cookie with it
[02:31:50] <Bish> could be source of the problem
[02:32:11] <Bish> can i somehow append the cookie?
[02:32:14] <Cork> that is more likely yes
[02:32:52] <Bish> (im creating a chrome extension with jquery.. thought that since it's using the context of the page, it would use it's cookies, but it seems like it doesn't)
[02:33:35] <daanavit_> how can I disable all other javascript and play a few animations when the page has just loaded?
[02:33:47] <daanavit_> when the animations are finished, everything should continue as usual
[02:34:12] <Cork> daanavit_: you can't really disable javascript
[02:34:27] <Cork> the code would have to have a way to be tolled to not do anything
[02:35:00] <Bish> Cork, can i add cookies to a xhr request?
[02:35:22] <Cork> Bish: you might with a cookie header
[02:35:34] <Cork> but no grantee
[02:35:49] <Cork> *guarantee
[02:36:01] <Bish> wondering why it doesn't send it automaticially
[02:36:29] <Cork> might be something the browser does specifically
[02:37:01] <shafox> hi, a small problem, question is over at SO. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16437098/nested-select-option-in-jquery
[02:41:31] <Bish> Refused to set unsafe header "Cookie"
[02:41:34] <Bish> meh.
[02:43:03] <Bish> those are limitations due to XSS :/
[02:43:14] <Cork> Bish: you could try GM_xmlhttpRequest
[02:44:03] <Bish> well im using chrome
[02:44:17] <Cork> chrome extensions has it too
[02:44:25] <Bish> okay, cool
[02:44:41] <Cork> oh, wait no damn it's through an extension
[02:44:43] <Bish> man that sux, because i should've access to it, im wondering anyways, why it doesn't send the cookie with it
[02:44:46] <Cork> (and it's just faked...)
[02:45:07] <Bish> mb the background page is allowed to do that *test*
[02:45:24] <Cork> oh, wait yes it has been implemented http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=4476
[02:45:58] <Cork> doens't really help though >_>
[02:47:10] <Bish> i hope the background page is allowed to set cookies
[02:47:55] <Cork> Bish: btw are you injecting a script in the page or just running in content from the extension?
[02:48:28] <Bish> injected script, that's why i thougt it gonna take the cookie
[03:07:53] <Bish> Cork, background page also refuses to set cookie :(
[03:09:46] <Bish> Cork, haha, but it sends the cookie, what a weird fuck
[03:09:58] <Cork> heh
[03:10:02] <Raydiation> are there promises for animations?
[03:10:16] <Cork> no
[03:10:20] <Raydiation> i mean im writing tests with selenium
[03:10:43] <Raydiation> and i want to test if a div is not visible anymore when i click on a link
[03:10:51] <Cork> as it returns the jquery object you can't get a promise out from it
[03:10:54] <Raydiation> i use a slideUp effect though
[03:11:16] <Raydiation> is there a way to hook after the animation is finished?
[03:11:16] <Cork> you would have to use the callback
[03:11:23] <Cork> the callback
[03:12:05] <Raydiation> i cant change the code though since its a test
[03:12:17] <Raydiation> i need to somehow hook into that
[03:12:36] <Cork> you could write an extension with an alternative function that uses promise
[03:12:57] <Cork> slideUpPromise or something
[03:13:19] <Raydiation> dunno if that would be sensible for testing
[03:13:39] <Cork> you don't really have a choice if you HAVE to have a promise
[03:14:23] <Raydiation> ah i remember
[03:14:27] <Raydiation> you can turn off animations
[03:14:44] <Raydiation> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.fx.off/
[03:15:09] <Cork> hmm) {  }
[03:15:11] <Cork> opps
[03:15:20] <Cork> hmm, ther actually looks like there is a way
[03:15:34] <Cork> $().promise('fx') <-- didn't know about that one
[03:16:13] <Cork> that is kinda nice!
[03:16:57] <Cork> oh, and 'fx' is default so it's not even needed
[03:19:29] <grek> hi,
[03:19:57] <grek> i send file witch  - reader.readAsDataURL(file); and jquery post but when i save it on disk witch php file is unreadable - only text file is readable
[03:20:09] <grek> image , pdf  - dont open after save
[03:20:21] <grek> what can by problem ?
[03:20:37] <Cork> you might get a part of the header or something in the saved data
[03:20:51] <Cork> make a hexdiff of the two files
[03:22:38] <grek> ok i try
[03:25:10] <lolmaus> Hi! I've got adjacent blocks and i would like to let users resize them. Enlarging a block should shrink the next block. What's the simpliest way to do that?
[03:26:25] <Cork> lolmaus: with cross browser support... a table
[03:26:52] <Cork> in modern browsers there is flex
[03:27:09] <Cork> ?g mdn css flex boxes
[03:27:31] <Cork> wow, both bots are dead...
[03:27:38] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/Tutorials/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes
[03:28:31] <lolmaus> Cork, i mean resizing by dragging an edge of an element with a mouse.
[03:29:03] <Cork> lolmaus: the problematic part is keeping the adjacent updated
[03:29:22] <Cork> just plain resizing is through jquery ui resizable
[03:29:39] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/resizable/
[03:29:53] <lolmaus> Cork, i saw that but it lacks an example of my use case.
[03:30:24] <Cork> the updating of the adjacent ones yes
[03:30:47] <Cork> you would have to do that in the resize event
[03:32:23] <lolmaus> Cork, i wanted to copy JS from http://jsbin.com/ open source project, but it turned out to be way too complicated: https://github.com/remy/jsbin/blob/master/public/js/chrome/splitter.js
[03:32:55] <Cork> not "way to", it is complicated
[03:33:19] <Cork> cause you would have to take the window size into account, and overflow, and so on
[03:33:47] <Cork> at least if you want to make it stable
[03:34:03] <vitozev> Hello, guys! I am looking for jQuery pan and zoom plugin for canvas element, but it would be better if it's auto dragable (no need to click for dragging), any suggestions? :)
[03:38:28] <lolmaus> Cork, do you think that using <table> will make it simplier?
[03:38:52] <Cork> it will make parts simpler, and other parts harder
[03:39:01] <Cork> there will be snags more or less what ever you do
[03:39:35] <Cork> biggest reason to not use table is cause it violates the semantics of html
[03:41:35] <shafox> anyother alternative of this https://github.com/harvesthq/chosen
[03:42:12] <Cork> shafox: jquery autocomplete
[03:42:28] <shafox> Cork: with multiselect ?
[03:42:39] <Cork> hmm good question, haven't checked
[03:43:40] <shafox> Cork: that chosen let multiselect with a autocomplete. dunno why that one is not working with mine
[03:43:44] <grek> i try change methot to send file from html jquery - here is script  - http://pastebin.com/dWrbV3m7
[03:43:54] <grek> what is wrong ?
[03:44:05] <grek> how attach file to ajax post
[03:45:05] <Cork> shafox: http://code.drewwilson.com/entry/autosuggest-jquery-plugin ?
[03:46:15] <shafox> yeah thanks Cork :)
[03:46:39] <Cork> shafox: http://loopj.com/jquery-tokeninput/demo.html another one
[03:47:13] <Cork> shafox: and a third one http://www.devthought.com/wp-content/projects/mootools/textboxlist/Demo/
[03:47:30] <shafox> Cork: try the first input field with letter "f" and see what the first choice comes :P
[03:49:27] <develkar> Does this IRC channel have an automated bot?
[03:49:45] <Cork> not right now
[03:49:49] <Cork> but normally it has two :/
[03:53:05] <Qdest> Cork, is there something like hasAttr?
[03:53:34] <Cork> $('[attr="value"]')
[03:53:51] <Cork> or just attr('attr') ==
[03:58:43] <lolmaus> Cork, i've found this: http://www.methvin.com/splitter/ :D
[03:59:43] <Cork> lolmaus: check the size of the lib :)
[03:59:55] <Cork> it is aprox the same size as the jsbin one :)
[04:00:32] <Qdest> var background = $(this).attr('data-fan-bg');  and  $('[src="' + background + '"]', bgImages).toggleClass('active'); and so bgImages contain all the <img/> i want, and background fetches a src from the images, now I want to select "that" image
[04:00:48] <lolmaus> Cork, yeah but it's a plugin with documentation and usage examples! :D
[04:01:23] <shafox> do you know how to put max limit for the multiselect in that chosen library ?
[04:01:30] <Cork> Qdest: sorry but.. that get's be itchy :)
[04:02:12] <Cork> Qdest: $(bgImages).filter(function() { return this.src === background; }).toggleClass('active');
[04:02:13] <Qdest> haha, I have a 3 set navigation with <a href="#" data-fan-bg="src of image">, when I click this anchor I want to set 'active' to that image
[04:04:41] <Qdest> Cork Â» http://jsfiddle.net/dzcqf/4/ <-- could you take a look at line 165 if you got a spare minute?
[04:04:45] <lolmaus> Cork, gah! That plugin relies on an outdated version of jQuery! :((
[04:05:49] <Qdest> Cork Â» what I am trying to do is use the "bottom" navigation to select 'a' background image which is the bigger light gray area. I want to "switch" .active on the images in .bgs
[04:06:52] <theresajayne_> I am having problems with A jquery event, its firing ok, but its pulling back the wrong item in some cases, wonder if anyone can suggest what i am doing wrong? http://jsfiddle.net/Dy5ea/
[04:08:15] <theresajayne_> an update http://jsfiddle.net/Dy5ea/1/
[04:08:18] <vitozev> Hello, guys! I am looking for jQuery pan and zoom plugin for canvas element, but it would be better if it's auto dragable (no need to click for dragging), any suggestions? :)
[04:09:21] <sacho> theresajayne_, http://jsfiddle.net/Dy5ea/2/ now it does
[04:11:05] <sacho> theresajayne_, what's up with the e var?
[04:11:21] <theresajayne_> legacy code to be removed
[04:11:31] <Bish> if im having something like for(;;) { var date = new Date(year,month,i); $.ajax(..) }
[04:11:41] <sacho> theresajayne_, jquery events guarantee the existance of stopPropagation
[04:11:48] <Bish> date will always the the last one becuase of the asynchronous behaviour how can i change that?
[04:12:08] <theresajayne_> sacho if you are talking about your change adding jquery thats not the problem i just pasted the code into fiddle from ide
[04:12:18] <anli> Can I add a validation error to an input using client side script?
[04:12:30] <sacho> no, I'll tell you the problem, but I like nitpicking first
[04:13:40] <theresajayne_> i am catching the event from the a click so why is it returning the img instead?
[04:13:42] <theresajayne_> http://jsfiddle.net/Dy5ea/4/
[04:13:50] <sacho> theresajayne_, event.target refers to the source element - that is, the element that this event was first triggered on.
[04:13:55] <theresajayne_> (i like alerts i can see the issue then)
[04:14:14] <sacho> you can also see it with console.log, but with less blocking
[04:14:15] <theresajayne_> ok so how do i ensure its the a that is returned?
[04:14:40] <theresajayne_> (i am trying to bugfix someone elses code here BTW)
[04:15:03] <sacho> theresajayne_, please readeth http://api.jquery.com/on/ section The event handler and its environment
[04:15:24] <sacho> the tl;dr is to use this instead of event.target, but it's useful information.
[04:15:53] <TheresaJayne> thanks
[04:16:14] <TheresaJayne> hopefully the new web dev starts in 2 weeks, then i can get back to server shenanigans
[04:21:23] <Qdest> sacho Â» maybe I could get your input too as cork seems to be too busy at the moment?
[04:22:01] <sacho> that code looks familiar.
[04:22:41] <sacho> black square gray square guy!
[04:22:47] <Qdest> :) it should! you helped me the other day with the slider
[04:23:24] <Qdest> but today I'm stuck elsewhere, I'm stuck at selecting a BG (line 144)
[04:24:54] <Qdest> What I am trying to accomplish here is to have the bottom nav decide '.active' on the images in .bgs
[04:25:43] <Qdest> first I'd like to check if something other than what is selected has active and remove it then apply active to whatever I selected - but I'm having trouble selecting the right <img />
[04:27:23] <sacho> seems like you're missing the second part
[04:28:05] <Qdest> I'm a bit lost in there, yeah.
[04:29:48] <seutje> Qdest: this.src on an img element doesn't return the exact value of the src attribute
[04:30:01] <seutje> prop vs attr kinda thing
[04:30:08] <Bish> Help pls: im having a for loop like for(i=0;i<DaysOfMonth;i++) $.ajax(...); inside the success function of $.ajax i will always be 32, because of the asynchronousity
[04:30:17] <Bish> how do i fix that
[04:31:03] <seutje> Qdest: for instance <img src="foo.png" /> on http://example.com will have a this.src of "http://example.com/foo.png" so you probably want either this.getAttribute('src') or $(this).attr('src')
[04:31:10] <sacho> <ecmabot> Bish: If something is only being applied to the 'last' one of many, you have a scoping problem. e.g.: in for (i=0; i<5; ++i) {doX(function(){ doY(i) })}; `doY' might only receive 4 as a value. You can solve this using closures, so see !closures. For more info see http://www.mennovanslooten.nl/blog/post/62/
[04:32:02] <Bish> sacho, thx
[04:33:50] <Qdest> seutje Â» that partly works, thank you! How can I make sure only "1" element can have the active class?
[04:33:58] <Qdest> so it switches rather than toggles?
[04:34:57] <seutje> Qdest: $(bgImages).removeClass('active').filter(function(){...}).addClass('active') ?
[04:36:47] <Qdest> awesome! thanks

[04:53:08] <hxm> someone knows aloha-editor? it seems to use jquery 1.7.2 but i want to use 1.9 in my site
[04:53:21] <hxm> what can happen if load 2 different versions of jquery?
[04:53:26] <hxm> i could just want to load one
[04:53:52] <fabioportieri> stick with 1.7.2
[04:54:16] <hxm> but 1.7.2 does not have the draggable feature
[04:54:44] <hxm> and the .open method for dialogs
[04:54:53] <fabioportieri> discard aloha or try to see if it works with an updated jquery
[04:55:03] <fabioportieri> wtf is aloha aniway?
[04:55:27] <hxm> a wysiwyg editor
[04:55:43] <fabioportieri> i use redactor atm
[04:55:59] <hxm> ok i go google
[04:57:04] <hxm> $99 the cheapest version
[05:03:21] <fabioportieri> i thought it had a oem license
[05:05:10] <Qdest> thanks again seutje !
[05:06:17] <seutje> any time!
[05:07:03] <seutje> fabioportieri: aloha is the editor that made contenteditable cool again :P
[05:07:12] <lenswipee> seutje you are really good at jquery
[05:07:47] <fabioportieri> is it cool?
[05:08:07] <seutje> lenswipee: lies, this is my first day
[05:08:22] <seutje> fabioportieri: definitely shows potential
[05:08:38] <seutje> and I think it no longer insists on shipping its own jQuery version
[05:09:58] <lenswipee> seutje: your welcome
[05:10:23] <fabioportieri> i wonder how it behaves when pasting content from word files
[05:13:53] <ecky--ptang-zoob> $("#myarea").show() works and $("myarea").toggle() does not work... how can it be?!!!

[05:18:14] <Wamer> hello guys â€¦ i would like to ask you for your advice .. i need to something like this http://cl.ly/image/090q2D3b3y47 .. it is simple counter that is supposed to count to some given value â€¦ number sliding from top or bottom, dont really care ...
[05:18:24] <Wamer> is there any good plugin for this or something at all ?
[05:18:30] <PREFIX|> haven't you been asking about that loropiana site for days now?
[05:19:06] <Wamer> it starts at 00% and goes to lets say 56% .. possibly with easyInOut
[05:19:12] <Wamer> easeInOut*
[05:20:12] <PREFIX|> nFFF: which part of the animation?
[05:20:57] <nFFF> both the initial drawing
[05:21:03] <nFFF> and the hover
[05:21:12] <nFFF> the hover one isn['t too hard
[05:21:22] <nFFF> but more then initial drawing

[05:33:35] <recon_lap> hi, just want to ask, when using datepicker, if I want to show one format but process another to the database is the best option to use a hidden field as a altField ? or is there a way to get the control to post a different format that the one displayed?

[05:42:41] <develkar> hello everyone, I'm trying to get the original width of the image with jquery using : http://paste2.org/AVcEjxIW
[05:43:05] <develkar> but when the image is resized in the slideshow, the code doesn't return correct width
[05:43:16] <develkar> am I doing it the right way
[05:44:05] <fabioportieri> develkar: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1944280/determine-original-size-of-image-cross-browser
[05:45:11] <develkar> fabioportieri, thank you, I'll try this an report back
[05:45:25] <fabioportieri> no prob
[05:47:31] <fabioportieri> develkar: i would try a simple $("#idOfImage").on("load",function(){ console.log(this.width);}); not tested tho
[05:48:03] <fabioportieri> iirc load event has issues
[05:48:57] <eizdealer> hey guys. how do i remove a number at the end of a string? say i have "foo1test123" i'd like to get foo1 - i tried test.replace(/\d+/g, ''), however this replaces all numbersâ€¦
[05:49:44] <fabioportieri> put a $ after + maybe
[05:50:35] <eizdealer> great that worked fabioportieri! thx
[05:50:53] <develkar> fabioportieri, This will be applicable on image onload, is there a way to get the width of already loaded image?
[05:51:00] <fabioportieri> nop
[05:51:53] <fabioportieri> develkar: i'm afraid retrieval of original size has to go through the load event sorry
[05:52:44] <develkar> fabioportieri, okay, thank you for your help!
[05:53:01] <shafox> how to generate a table where the user will input the number of columns and rows ??
[05:56:20] <lolmaus> Cork, yay! I did resizing panels myself! http://jsbin.com/obemig/3/edit No support for window resizing yet

[06:24:30] <Anticom> hi all
[06:24:39] <Anticom> anyone familiar with maphilight plugin?
[06:24:40] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/7AW5b/
[06:24:59] <Anticom> when you hover over "Bayern" the area is Black instead of red as intended to be
[06:25:07] <Anticom> i just don't get, what's happening there
[06:26:25] <Anticom> http://davidlynch.org/projects/maphilight/docs/demo_features.html i mean here it's done in a similar way
[06:26:48] <Anticom> well it's set by html and not using jq.data() method
[06:26:52] <fabioportieri> Anticom: http://jsfiddle.net/7AW5b/1/
[06:27:12] <fabioportieri> you had a class noselect that make it black
[06:27:19] <Anticom> nope
[06:27:28] <Anticom> noselect should make it red
[06:27:38] <Anticom> there's no css rule for .noselect
[06:27:43] <Anticom> but there is some jq logic
[06:28:34] <Anticom> [...] if($this.hasClass('noselect')) { var data = { fillColor   : fc_disabled } $this.data('maphilight', data).trigger('alwaysOn.maphilight');
[06:29:10] <fabioportieri> then something wrong with fc_disabled i suppose
[06:29:54] <Anticom> fabioportieri you sir are a damn wizzard
[06:29:57] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/7AW5b/3/#
[06:29:59] <Anticom> http://jsfiddle.net/7AW5b/3/ *
[06:30:01] <Anticom> haha
[06:30:12] <Anticom> ff0000 instead of #ff0000
[06:30:13] <Anticom> -.-
[06:30:28] <Anticom> that's why plugins sometimes suck :D
[06:30:43] <fabioportieri> good job
[06:33:36] <Itrace> I have a simple bit of JSON that looks like this: "var obj = {mealDateTime01: "2013-04-01 11:30 am"} ". How can I get the time value out of that? I tried this: "â€¦   obj[0]   â€¦" but that didn't work.
[06:34:17] <fabioportieri> i would add " " to mealDateTime01
[06:35:36] <Itrace> I don't have any control over the JSON object.
[06:36:43] <Itrace> This " obj[0] " returns undefined
[06:36:49] <Anticom> Itrace obj.mealDateTime01 OR obj['mealDateTime01']
[06:36:50] <seutje> obj.mealDateTime01 ?
[06:36:53] <Anticom> i'd recommend the second
[06:38:14] <vsgill> I'm trying to add html 5 audio player on a lightbox popup. I'm using ColorBox. It works fine but when I load the same popup the second time the player disappears, anyone come across this before?
[06:38:17] <Itrace> OK. I was hoping there would be a way to get the value with just the index. I'm not always going to know the correct name.
[06:39:16] <vsgill> Oh and it's just on ipad and iphone with this issue
[06:44:49] <nFFF> Does anyone know any plugins or methods to create animations/drawings of colors like on here http://www.loropiana.com/flash.html#/lang:en/home
[06:46:05] <fabioportieri> webgl maybe
[06:47:57] <PREFIX|> nFFF: make about 200+ PNG images
[06:48:04] <PREFIX|> with transparent background
[06:48:06] <PREFIX|> and show them in order
[06:48:10] <PREFIX|> tadaaa
[06:51:46] <nFFF> so basically make the animations as .pngs and just change images
[06:51:49] <nFFF> no other way
[06:53:45] <fabioportieri> do not try this at home
[06:56:33] <fabioportieri> what about this? http://active.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html5/ocanvas-a-jquery-and-flash-style-library-for-html5-canvas/
[06:56:43] <seutje> nFFF: consider using a sprite so it's not 200+ requests and u don't have to preload them all
[06:56:53] <seutje> it's how google does their animated doodles

[07:00:33] <ThoMe> hiho
[07:00:37] <ThoMe> is it posible shorter as this: jQuery(data.results).size()
[07:00:38] <ThoMe> ?
[07:00:48] <ThoMe> i must write jQuery or?
[07:01:24] <ThoMe> whatis bettter size or length?
[07:02:03] <seutje> ThoMe: use length, size is silly, rly
[07:02:16] <ThoMe> seutje: you know php?
[07:02:27] <ThoMe> seutje: when i use             $data['results'][$appleStoreId] = array(
[07:02:29] <seutje> I know enough to dislike it :D
[07:02:38] <ThoMe> then is length undefinied
[07:02:40] <ThoMe> when i use
[07:02:46] <ThoMe>             $data['results'][] = array(
[07:02:50] <ThoMe> then i have length = 1
[07:03:00] <ThoMe> $appleStoreId is a digit with 8
[07:03:14] <ThoMe> [] is 0, 1, 2, ...
[07:03:42] <ThoMe> why?
[07:04:25] <seutje> <ThoMe> then i have length = 1 <- you mean when it gets returned and you run .length on the JS object?
[07:04:37] <ThoMe> seutje: yes.
[07:04:48] <seutje> ThoMe: I believe php's json_encode assumes arrays with funky keys are objects
[07:04:54] <ThoMe> hm.
[07:04:57] <seutje> and objects don't have .length
[07:04:58] <ThoMe> what is a good alternate?
[07:05:00] <ThoMe> hm.
[07:05:18] <seutje> ThoMe: why do u want 8 to be the key>
[07:05:18] <seutje> ?
[07:05:33] <ThoMe> seutje: i  need this in php. i check if exists key x.
[07:06:11] <ThoMe> hm. but is ok. i try... :-)
[07:08:38] <seutje> ThoMe: in_array?
[07:08:44] <ThoMe> seutje: example. yes.
[07:08:54] <ThoMe> in_array, key_exists..
[07:09:13] <ThoMe> but i search the appleApp-ID ..
[07:09:19] <ThoMe> and [] generate the next arrayid
[07:09:28] <ThoMe> liike
[07:09:29] <ThoMe> $data['results'][] = array( 'mdmAppId' => $mdmAppId,
[07:09:37] <ThoMe> json_encode((object) $data);
[07:09:39] <ThoMe> blub.
[07:10:08] <seutje> in_array($data['results'], array('mdmAppId' => $mdmAppId)); ?
[07:10:24] <seutje> iono, I suck with data structs
[07:10:28] <ThoMe> oeh. yes?
[07:10:31] <seutje> and php also sucks with data structs
[07:10:34] <ThoMe> hm.
[07:10:42] <ThoMe> in_array($data['results'], array('mdmAppId' => $mdmAppId)); << this works?
[07:10:43] <seutje> unfortunately, 2 wrong don't make a right :P
[07:10:46] <seutje> iono
[07:10:47] <ThoMe> :P
[07:10:51] <ThoMe> iono?
[07:10:58] <seutje> I don't know
[07:11:06] <BillCriswell> I imagine you'd need to look it up by key then check the value?
[07:11:09] <seutje> but said in the way a 12 year old would
[07:11:44] <alex88> if I do a .find() will it return a jquery object? Since I'm doing a find and there a .each(i, el) and el is a dom object, not a jquery element.. is there a way to get the jquery element?
[07:12:00] <BillCriswell> alex88: Wrap it with $()
[07:12:19] <BillCriswell> alex88: Also, this is the dom element, so you can do $(this) in the each as well
[07:12:27] <alex88> BillCriswell: yeah, no other way? maybe just el = $(el)
[07:12:43] <seutje> sure
[07:12:50] <seutje> I usually use var $this = $(this)
[07:13:00] <seutje> but only if I need it more than once
[07:13:01] <BillCriswell> I prefer to prepend a $ with jQuery variables, so I do var $el = $(this) usually.
[07:13:20] <BillCriswell> Well... jQuery object variable names.
[07:16:05] <pythonirc1013> how can I easily test if jquery is loaded and properly working using qunit?
[07:16:28] <seutje> run the entire suite?
[07:17:04] <pythonirc1013> seutje: is there a simple one line test that at least tests if jquery got loaded?
[07:17:04] <fabioportieri> if (typeof jQuery != 'undefined') {
[07:18:13] <seutje> yeah, like that, or like (function(w) { if (w.jQuery) { /* we gots it! */ } })(this)
[07:18:23] <pythonirc1013> fabioportieri: ok( typeof jQuery != 'undefined', "JQuery Load Test" ); ?
[07:18:38] <seutje> don't *have* to check it's type though
[07:18:47] <seutje> undefined is false, any other form of jQuery isn't
[07:19:00] <pythonirc1013> is that a valid test, it seems to pass
[07:21:13] <Absolute0> Is class selection faster than argument selection? And if it is, does it matter for real world case scenarios?
[07:21:57] <BadCodSmell> Why do I sometimes have to use filter and at other times find?
[07:23:18] <pythonirc1013> is there an easy way to test if my jquery code can do get/post without using my server?
[07:23:35] <fabioportieri> filter is used to reduce a set of elements, find creates a new set
[07:23:59] <BadCodSmell> Sometimes find doesn't work though
[07:24:13] <BadCodSmell> So I have to use filter
[07:24:32] <fabioportieri> of course they do different things
[07:25:54] <BadCodSmell> That's meaningless to me.
[07:25:59] <JeeppsoN> pythonirc1013, just look at chrome web inspector -> network? (if I understood you correctly)
[07:26:21] <sacho> BadCodSmell, all selection functions operate on jquery collections - I'm pointing that out to reduce redundancy when discussing each one. find() searches the descendants of the collection for elements matching the selector. filter() reduces a collection based on a condition.
[07:26:41] <sacho> descendants referring to the DOM tree.
[07:27:21] <BadCodSmell> So is that a findthat includes the top level?
[07:27:51] <BadCodSmell> Because having to both filter and find one everything is a bummer
[07:27:54] <pythonirc1013> JeeppsoN: I'm trying to write a test so that I can make sure my jquery code can do ajax calls. Of course I could use the console/network to detect the problem.
[07:30:00] <sacho> BadCodSmell, no, filter does not search the descendants.
[07:30:09] <sacho> filter only operates on the current collection.
[07:30:53] <sacho> BadCodSmell, see addBack()
[07:34:23] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: find() is for child elements.
[07:34:31] <BillCriswell> Oh, way late.
[07:34:43] <BillCriswell> Still don't got this scrolling thing down yet.
[07:37:13] <BadCodSmell> I don't see how addBack is helpful
[07:37:54] <BadCodSmell> BillCriswell: I still don't really get it
[07:39:51] <BadCodSmell> $('<div><a><p></p></a></div>').find('a').find('p')
[07:40:13] <BadCodSmell> However the first find wraps the result it works with the second
[07:40:23] <BadCodSmell> But $() wraps all of the top level elements...
[07:40:35] <BadCodSmell> Somehow making them inaccessible to find
[07:40:45] <BadCodSmell> Why isn't it just wrapped the same as a result from find?
[07:41:19] <BadCodSmell> ah I see
[07:41:23] <sacho> You seem to keep trying to cram your square in that round hole.
[07:41:44] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: I have a hard time explaining it to be honest, but I just know which one to use when I need to haha.
[07:42:03] <BadCodSmell> I never had a problem with just find until now
[07:42:25] <DavidScherer> Everything works here in IE10 except changing the value of the dropdown?
[07:42:25] <DavidScherer> http://jsfiddle.net/z5hRT/
[07:42:34] <DavidScherer> Any suggestions?
[07:42:49] <BillCriswell> I'm guessing .find() in $('<div class="foo"><p>Ah</p></div>') makes this the .foo div?
[07:42:56] <BadCodSmell> I guess the problem comes from wrapping a bunch of stuff that has no root element
[07:42:58] <BillCriswell> $('<div class="foo"><p>Ah</p></div>').filter('.foo') works, $('<div class="foo"><p>Ah</p></div>').find('.foo') does not.
[07:44:47] <BadCodSmell> So there is no find inclusive of top level elements and no way to pseudo wrap them without putting them in a dummy element?
[07:48:46] <sacho> BadCodSmell, $elements = $(); $().find().find().find().add($elements)
[07:49:47] <shafox> anyone can take a look at the js fiddel and tell me what to do to add a thead to the table so that it will match the number of columns and will generate the header as a,b,c, and so on .. http://jsfiddle.net/shafox/ttxPR/5/
[07:50:00] <BadCodSmell> That doesn't work.
[07:50:35] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: If you really need it that way the second answer here seems promising: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3637298/jquery-find-ignores-root-node
[07:50:51] <BadCodSmell> I already have such a solution
[07:51:01] <BadCodSmell> The problem is it's really bad for performance
[07:51:12] <BadCodSmell> Hence I'm revisiting the issue
[07:55:12] <BillCriswell> BadCodSmell: $('<div class="foo"><p>Ah</p></div>').add().filter('.foo') could do what you want.
[07:55:36] <BadCodSmell> Actually that will work without the add
[07:56:01] <BillCriswell> Ah crap. Tested with the wrong thing.
[07:56:56] <pythonirc1013> I'm trying to use siblings() on a bunch of spans inside a div, doesn't seem to work
[07:57:12] <pythonirc1013> Any ideas if something is inherently different between "li" and "span" for "siblings()" call?
[07:58:27] <BillCriswell> pythonirc1013: Are you sure they're siblings?
[08:00:21] <magixx32> how to get get this example http://jsbin.com/efejop/1/edit to correctly get the width, currently things seems to be happening out of order and that is why width is returned as 0 in the console
[08:02:03] <pythonirc1013> BillCriswell: Was trying to create a fiddle, couldn't. Something I am doing wrong.
[08:03:15] <BillCriswell> magixx32: You have to wait till your images are loaded before you call width probably.
[08:03:37] <thinkt4nk> does the * character have any special function in a jquery selector string?
[08:03:46] <thinkt4nk> i.e. is it treated like a glob or something?
[08:03:51] <BillCriswell> thinkt4nk: It matches any element.
[08:04:11] <thinkt4nk> hmm
[08:04:12] <BadCodSmell> It's wild card normally, probably the same in jquery
[08:04:38] <thinkt4nk> so if I have an element whose id is "meh**", and I select $('#meh**'), is there any reason it should fail?
[08:04:42] <magixx32> yes i know I need for it to wait before getting properties, how would i do that?
[08:04:49] <thinkt4nk> all other variables excluded
[08:04:51] <BadCodSmell> It's stand alone usually
[08:04:55] <magixx32> do i need to use deffered or promises?
[08:05:06] <BadCodSmell> I've never seen the wild card used like that in selectors
[08:05:12] <magixx32> for each function in order to run sequentially
[08:05:12] <fabioportieri> magixx32: use an each loop and retrieve the width inside that
[08:05:27] <BadCodSmell> You might need some regex match or something
[08:05:32] <thinkt4nk> yeah, unfortunately, that character is found in the set that we're using to encode ID's for our models
[08:05:37] <BadCodSmell> Just look at the selectors doc
[08:05:48] <magixx32> i don't see how a for each loop would help
[08:05:53] <thinkt4nk> BadCodSmell I did
[08:05:56] <BadCodSmell> **  would probably be wrong anyway for glob, would be ?? or just *
[08:06:02] <fabioportieri> thinkt4nk: that is not a valid char for an id
[08:06:14] <thinkt4nk> ah, that makes more sense
[08:06:18] <BadCodSmell> Well probably yeh, it's a special character
[08:06:22] <thinkt4nk> thanks, fabioportieri
[08:06:28] <fabioportieri> nop
[08:06:32] <maxwell_> Hey guys anybody knows how can i pass the ui.item.id as a parameter in the second autocomplete that what i can make results dependable one from each other http://jsfiddle.net/73Cfe/
[08:07:01] <vsgill> can't seem to figure it out, fancybox strips out my <audio> tag after it closes, and when i open it again it's gone
[08:07:10] <vsgill> anyone ?
[08:07:12] <fabioportieri> magixx32: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5240532/get-image-size-with-jquery
[08:07:14] <BadCodSmell> most people would just stick to [[:alnum:]_-] for ids
[08:07:20] <vsgill> on iPad
[08:08:10] <magixx32> that link is of no use and unrelated
[08:08:28] <BillCriswell> I don't think an ID can start with a number, nor can a class.
[08:08:32] <fabioportieri> didn't you need to get image size?
[08:09:06] <magixx32> it's not the getting the width function i have trouble with, it's getting width after a certain stuff has occured that i cannot seem do
[08:09:48] <magixx32> the getting width function is called at the wrong time before images and other actions have occurred
[08:10:54] <fabioportieri> ah then you have to listen to load event for the images i guess
[08:11:19] <BillCriswell> magixx32: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3877027/jquery-callback-on-image-load-even-when-the-image-is-cached seems like a good solutions
[08:12:00] <magixx32> other ajax stuff has to happen in order for the width property to work, these are not running before and thus getwidth returns 0
[08:12:58] <BillCriswell> magixx32: Do you know the width of the images?
[08:13:03] <magixx32> i have to, for example set the object to have not have a display:none, if this does not happen before calling the image width, then it is 0
[08:13:04] <magixx32> no
[08:13:16] <magixx32> widths and heights are dynamically set
[08:13:52] <magixx32> basically in http://jsbin.com/efejop/1/edit i need the stuff in setDisplaySize to run sequeantally
[08:15:27] <BillCriswell> I can't help but feel like you can do this in a more sane manner.
[08:18:12] <magixx32> the sane way would be that stuff in setDisplaySize would run sequentially naturally, but they do not
[08:24:20] <BillCriswell> If browsers waited for images to load sequentially it would be very slow. You can make it do that, but I feel like there could be better solutions.
[08:28:42] <Itrace> Can I target multiple events like this: obj.on('click, change', function(e) {} ?
[08:32:37] <BillCriswell> Itrace: no comma.
[08:32:50] <Itrace> billCriswell: thanks
[08:37:21] <maxwell_> Hey guys anybody knows how can i pass the ui.item.id as a parameter from the first autocomplete in the second autocomplete that whay i can make results dependable one from each other http://jsfiddle.net/73Cfe/
[08:37:21] <weggie> I have a quick jQuery question: http://jsfiddle.net/mwoods98/MHrJJ/ Fiddle example with more info Thanks!
[08:47:53] <Mariogs37> hey all
[08:48:01] <Mariogs37> i have an ajax question, any experts in the house?
[08:48:32] <sacho> don't ask to ask
[08:49:59] <Mariogs37> so i have a json object coming back from my ajax request, but i can't seem to manipulate it using jquery
[08:50:01] <Mariogs37> here's my code
[08:50:13] <Mariogs37>   $('#rankings_link').click(function(){
[08:50:13] <Mariogs37>     $.ajax({
[08:50:15] <Mariogs37>       dataType: 'json',
[08:50:16] <Mariogs37>       url: '/rankings',
[08:50:18] <Mariogs37>       type: 'get'
[08:50:19] <Mariogs37>     }).done(function(received_data){
[08:50:21] <Mariogs37>       for (var m = 0; m < received_data.length; m++) {
[08:50:22] <Mariogs37>         $('#rankings ol').append('<li>' + received_data[m] + '</li>');
[08:50:23] <Mariogs37>       }
[08:50:25] <Mariogs37>     });
[08:50:25] <Mariogs37>   });
[08:51:11] <sacho> please read the topic
[08:51:11] <orentanay> Mariogs37, use a paste bin site, please don't dump more than a line of code.
[08:51:22] <Mariogs37> a paste bin site?
[08:51:57] <orentanay> http://jsfiddle.net or http://jsbin.com
[08:52:11] <r3n2o> Mariogs37, instead of .ajax try with http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[08:52:13] <orentanay> that is right out of the channel title. :-)
[08:52:20] <sacho> also, use a debugger of some sort to determine what you're getting back from the server.
[08:52:28] <Mariogs37> http://jsfiddle.net/h6HJg/
[08:52:34] <Mariogs37> shouldn't .ajax work?
[08:52:42] <Mariogs37> have tried using a debugger but not terribly helpful
[08:52:49] <Mariogs37> i'm getting back a json object cuz that's what i've specified
[08:52:50] <sacho> Why not?
[08:52:57] <Mariogs37> and it shows up as an array of strings
[08:53:00] <sacho> And the problem is?
[08:53:03] <Mariogs37> which is what it should be
[08:53:10] <r3n2o> if you use .ajax you have to make sure the json headers are application/json
[08:53:12] <Mariogs37> when i go to append each element in the array
[08:53:19] <Mariogs37> it doesn't do it
[08:53:23] <Mariogs37> json headers?
[08:53:48] <sacho> Mariogs37, so your problem is not related to ajax or manipulating a json object?
[08:53:59] <Mariogs37> it is related to manipulating the json object
[08:54:06] <Mariogs37> i'm trying to append each element to an ordered list
[08:54:09] <Mariogs37> if you see my code
[08:54:11] <Mariogs37> but it doesn't do that
[08:54:23] <BillCriswell> What's it doing instead? Any error? What's the output?
[08:54:33] <Mariogs37> output is a huge array of strings
[08:54:40] <Mariogs37> pre formatted text in html
[08:54:45] <orentanay> Mariogs37, are you trying to skip over the first item in your array? your first reference to received_data[m] has the value 1, but arrays are 0 based.
[08:54:59] <Mariogs37> mm no?
[08:55:05] <Mariogs37> i set m = 0
[08:55:22] <BillCriswell> What does the outputted HTML look like, is it even hitting the .done() ?
[08:55:22] <sacho> Mariogs37,please, more details.
[08:55:42] <sacho> in fact, since this isn't an ajax issue
[08:55:50] <sacho> why don't you create a literal with your data and run your loop through it
[08:55:55] <sacho> on a sample html page
[08:55:58] <sacho> and provide that as a test case
[08:56:08] <theresajayne_> Just a thought I have some javascript to remove bad chars from entry box, its causing w3c to complain, why is this?         var after = before.replace(/</g, "").replace("/>/g", "");         after = after.replace(/["\'][\s]*javascript:(.*)["\']/gi, "");
[08:56:36] <sacho> theresajayne_, what do you mean, "it's causing w3c to complain"?
[08:56:55] <theresajayne_> Line 413, Column 40: end tag for element "g" which is not open         var after = before.replace(/</g, "").replace(/>/g, "");
[08:57:02] <BillCriswell> theresajayne_: define "bad characters"?
[08:57:10] <Mariogs37> @bill, it's literally just a huge block of pre formatted text
[08:57:19] <BillCriswell> theresajayne_: Do you have it in <script> tags?
[08:57:46] <theresajayne_> BillCriswell its to remove any html from input box to try to stop sql injection (one of many things we have in place)
[08:57:48] <sacho> say what
[08:57:54] <sacho> theresajayne_, that's not a javascript error, right?
[08:57:55] <theresajayne_> yes its in a script tag
[08:57:55] <BillCriswell> Mariogs37: So it's not an actual array, just a string representation of an array?
[08:58:30] <maxwell_> Any suggestion?
[08:58:35] <theresajayne_> sacho no its the w3c validator complaining of the < and > in the regex, as the before.replace regex has no surrounding quotes
[08:58:40] <Mariogs37> @bill, correct
[08:58:48] <BillCriswell> theresajayne_: Are you sure you typed "script" accurately?
[08:59:04] <Mariogs37> so idk why it's displaying the json object  as pre formatted text and ignoring my jQuery stuff entirely
[08:59:11] <theresajayne_> it works, its just breaking xhtml 1.0 transitional rules
[08:59:14] <Mariogs37> like the code about appending each element
[08:59:36] <sacho> theresajayne_, is your script body in a CDATA tag?
[08:59:41] <theresajayne_> no
[09:00:19] <BillCriswell> theresajayne_: If you can, just use <!DOCTYPE html>, no reason for XHTML.
[09:00:44] <sacho> Mariogs37, it's hard to know when you're not providing any test case.
[09:00:59] <Mariogs37> i don't know what you mean by a test case
[09:01:04] <BillCriswell> Mariogs37: An example.
[09:01:05] <theresajayne_> Legacy yada yada old code blah blah!
[09:01:21] <sacho> Mariogs37, look at the big text dump right after your "I set m = 0" line.
[09:01:42] <BillCriswell> theresajayne_: Ick.
[09:01:56] <Mariogs37> the big text dump?
[09:01:59] <Mariogs37> can you be more specific?
[09:02:14] <BillCriswell> Wrap the contents of script in <!-- script stuff.... // -->
[09:02:49] <sacho> <sacho> why don't you create a literal with your data and run your loop through it<sacho> on a sample html page<sacho> and provide that as a test case
[09:03:37] <BillCriswell> When he says literal he means just putting the output of the ajax request into a variable
[09:04:21] <Mariogs37> ah
[09:05:14] <Mariogs37> i thought this portion of my code did that
[09:05:15] <Mariogs37> http://jsfiddle.net/h6HJg/1/
[09:05:22] <Mariogs37> "received_data" is that variable right?
[09:05:45] <BillCriswell> Mariogs37: And this is just an array of strings, not an array of objects?
[09:06:07] <Mariogs37> correct
[09:06:08] <Mariogs37> i think?
[09:06:10] <orentanay> I'd like to create my own function/method dispatcher similar to what Google _gaq does. I use jquery to insert a floating element on the page based on a few on page values. I also want to use a 3rd part A/B testing service to manipulate the content of this overlay. The problem is that it's creating a race condition and trying to manipulate my overlay before it's created. Does anyone have a lead
[09:06:10] <orentanay> to something online that discusses this? Thanks.
[09:06:46] <sacho> Mariogs37, that's not a test case. It doesn't run, it doesn't include your data, etc.
[09:06:47] <Mariogs37> @bill, i can show the actual ruby code that gets run?  tho i don't think that's the issue since the json object does come back
[09:07:33] <Mariogs37> @sacho, idk how id' do that given that this is part of a larger rails app
[09:07:42] <BillCriswell> What header is sent with the json? It should be application/json?
[09:07:53] <sacho> I don't see what the server side has to do with it
[09:07:53] <Mariogs37> not sure what you mean by headerâ€¦sorry
[09:08:11] <sacho> Alright, do this. console.log(JSON.stringify(received_data));
[09:08:35] <sacho> take that string, put it in a variable in your paste, then run JSON.parse() on it, put that in your loop, add some sample html that is similar to what you have
[09:08:46] <sacho> and run it.
[09:09:17] <Mariogs37> what do you mean by JSON.parse() and put it in my loop
[09:09:20] <Mariogs37> be more specific?
[09:09:42] <BillCriswell> If you're in Chome open the developers took and click "Network" then click the file that's requested the AJAX way and click the "headers" tab and go to "Response Headers" and view the "Content-Type"
[09:10:34] <Mariogs37> yeah
[09:10:36] <Mariogs37> it's application/json
[09:10:49] <Mariogs37> Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8
[09:10:54] <BillCriswell> Ok cool.
[09:12:23] <BillCriswell> What happens if you do console.log( typeof received_data )?
[09:13:03] <Mariogs37> so here's the thing
[09:13:09] <Mariogs37> when i console.log anything
[09:13:15] <Mariogs37> it doesn't actually come up in my console :(
[09:13:50] <sacho> put a breakpoint to find out if it's being executed.
[09:13:56] <BillCriswell> Would need a live example to see what's going on.
[09:16:00] <BillCriswell> God dammit.
[09:16:14] <BillCriswell> Mariogs37: It's just following the link.
[09:16:24] <Mariogs37> ?
[09:16:57] <BillCriswell> Do $('#link').on('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); /* Ajax stuff */ });
[09:17:14] <BillCriswell> Mariogs37: The reason you're seeing just a block of code is cuase you're just following the link to the JSON.
[09:17:22] <Mariogs37> mm
[09:17:27] <Mariogs37> @bill what do you mean by "following the link to the json"
[09:17:58] <BillCriswell> What is the href on the link you're clicking to trigger this?
[09:18:10] <lewandowski> any idea why im not getting the parameter in the second autocomplete http://jsfiddle.net/73Cfe/1/
[09:18:15] <Mariogs37> '/rankings'
[09:18:19] <shafox> hi, how to set the value of the dropped element to the droppable area ?? here is the fiddle . http://jsfiddle.net/shafox/qsEXb
[09:18:54] <BillCriswell> That's the same URL as your Ajax request.
[09:19:04] <Mariogs37> yeah
[09:19:09] <BillCriswell> That's why when you click it you're just seeing a block of text.
[09:19:28] <Mariogs37> so i want to go to the /rankings page and, on that page, have it append each element of the JSON object, right?
[09:19:34] <BillCriswell> You need to prevent your browser from actually going to that url.
[09:19:40] <Mariogs37> ohhhhh
[09:19:42] <BillCriswell> Mariogs37: No.
[09:19:43] <Mariogs37> i'm retarded
[09:19:55] <BillCriswell> Mariogs37: =)
[09:20:36] <Mariogs37> so this:
[09:20:37] <Mariogs37> $('#link').on('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault();
[09:20:58] <BillCriswell> That tells the browser to not actually go to that link.
[09:21:01] <Mariogs37> should go before all of my ajax stuff
[09:21:37] <BillCriswell> $('#link').on('click', function(e){ e.preventDefault(); $.ajax({ }).done(function(){ /* Add the items */ }); });
[09:22:46] <Mariogs37> so bill like this: http://jsfiddle.net/h6HJg/2/
[09:23:11] <BillCriswell> Mariogs37: Yes.
[09:23:43] <Mariogs37> really praying this works :)
[09:25:10] <BillCriswell> It should work.
[09:25:20] <Mariogs37> oh but wait
[09:25:22] <Mariogs37> this link
[09:25:25] <Mariogs37> is in my nag bar
[09:25:26] <Mariogs37> *nav bar
[09:25:30] <Mariogs37> so if i'm on a page that has a bunch of content
[09:25:35] <Mariogs37> and i'm updating the /rankings page
[09:25:38] <Mariogs37> it won't show...
[09:25:41] <Mariogs37> know what i mean?
[09:25:48] <Mariogs37> brb
[09:25:51] <BillCriswell> Ok
[09:30:15] <fission6> how do i select all tr's with a value of "today"
[09:30:51] <BillCriswell> fission6: trs really don't have values
[09:31:04] <fission6> td soryr
[09:31:25] <BillCriswell> You want to select <td>today</td> basically?
[09:31:50] <BillCriswell> $('td:contains("today")') should do it I think
[09:32:14] <fission6> thanks
[09:36:13] <Ryan-Woods> Hello all
[09:36:18] <friedbyte> I'm trying to find the width of my browser window, and use some if statements to hide various things on the page. The issue I'm having is if the browser has a scrollbar, the window width becomes wider. Any ideas for a workaround?
[09:36:19] <Ryan-Woods> I am having a jquery 1.9.1 issue!
[09:36:55] <caddoo> should I still use .change or .on('change
[09:36:55] <Ryan-Woods> When i use jquery from the website, (the http address) there is no problem, but when I download it and put it in my file system and call it that way, I am getting all sorts of errors that didn't exist before...
[09:37:02] <Forbidd3n> anyway to do a hasClass for multiple class check?
[09:37:07] <Ryan-Woods> Does anyone know why this might be?
[09:37:07] <caddoo> and why
[09:39:19] <friedbyte> This worked for me. Thanks!
[09:39:19] <friedbyte> var width = $('body').innerWidth();
[09:39:26] <Ryan-Woods> Hello?
[09:40:00] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: You can do $el.is('.foo.bar.baz')
[09:41:43] <BillCriswell> Ryan-Woods: It's really hard to figure out your problem without knowing the "all sorts of errors"
[09:42:10] <Forbidd3n> is this valid? -- var radios = $(this).find('input[type="radio",class*="required-"]');
[09:42:25] <Forbidd3n> get all radio type inputs with class that has required- in it
[09:42:47] <Eviltwin> I think you need to do input[type="radio"][class*="required-"]
[09:43:03] <BillCriswell> What Eviltwin said. You were close.
[09:43:13] <Eviltwin> As per http://api.jquery.com/multiple-attribute-selector/
[09:43:40] <Forbidd3n> Eviltwin: tahnks
[09:43:41] <Forbidd3n> thanks
[09:44:06] <Ryan-Woods> just errors in a migrate 1.1.1 jquery script. My general question is this, are there issues with downloading 1.9.1 query minimized version and using it? I just don't see how there could be an error. The formatting looks very weird to me... it isn't just a block of text like it usually is.
[09:44:12] <BillCriswell> Forbidd3n: Ther's also :radio[class*=required-]
[09:44:18] <relipse> i'm using moment.js, how do i code: if time is in future, set time to now(), display date .fromNow() unless it is over a day old, then display .calendar()
[09:44:19] <Forbidd3n> Eviltwin: what about this
[09:44:37] <Forbidd3n> var fields  = section.find('input:visible[class*="required-"]').not('[type="radio"]');
[09:44:49] <Eviltwin> That looks fine to me
[09:44:53] <BillCriswell> Ryan-Woods: Something could be corrupted maybe. Download and try again?
[09:44:53] <Forbidd3n> thanks
[09:45:04] <Eviltwin> Could also be input:visible[class*="required-"]:not([type="radio"])
[09:45:11] <Eviltwin> Not entirely sure which of those would be faster
[09:45:29] <Ryan-Woods> I have tried that. It is so weird to me.
[09:46:02] <BillCriswell> Ryan-Woods: Are you trying over file:/// or anything odd like that?
[09:52:12] <elisior> Hello
[09:52:32] <elisior> If I add a class to an element using jquery, how can I interact with that element's new class?
[09:52:59] <BillCriswell> elisior: Not sure what you mean by that.
[09:53:01] <seich> elisior: What kind of interactions are you talking about?
[09:53:21] <elisior> I've realized that if I have an img with one class, remove that class and add a new one, if i make a .click event binded to that new class nothing will happen. I suppose that's how it works right?
[09:53:57] <BillCriswell> It will if you change the class before you define the click event.
[09:54:10] <elisior> hmmm
[09:54:38] <BillCriswell> $('img').removeClass('old').addClass('new'); $('img.new').on('click', fn ); will work just fine.
[09:55:44] <elisior> BillCriswell: that's exactly what i'm doing
[09:56:00] <BillCriswell> You can't do $('.new').on('click', fn ); $('img').addClass('new');
[09:56:01] <elisior> really weird, im confused, cause it works with one element, but not with the other one
[09:56:05] <BillCriswell> elisior: Are you getting an error?
[09:56:12] <elisior> BillCriswell: no error at all
[09:56:51] <BillCriswell> elisior: http://pastie.org/ paste your code here and we can see if anything jumps out at us.
[09:57:04] <elisior> BillCriswell: http://coyotestore.bootic.net/products/diesel# try clicking on the + sign and then on the - sign. It works perfect, but if you do it on the image, it won't work the second time
[09:57:49] <elisior> Ok, here's the code http://pastie.org/7818842
[09:58:54] <sacho> elisior, you cannot bind a click event to a class.
[09:59:02] <sacho> click event handler*
[09:59:08] <elisior> Aaaah that's the problem!
[09:59:17] <sacho> you bind handlers to elements.
[09:59:34] <elisior> So I need to bind to the image
[09:59:56] <elisior> like img.bigger ?
[09:59:58] <sacho> that seems to be what you're doing already.
[10:00:08] <BillCriswell> Ok, so no images actually have the class of "bigger" when you run your script.
[10:01:46] <BillCriswell> You can use event delegation here, which would be like $('.product-gallery').on('click', '.bigger', function(){ });
[10:03:21] <diverdude> How do i make this type of selection with jcrop? http://www.flotcharts.org/flot/examples/selection/index.html  (fixed height)
[10:03:22] <BillCriswell> What this code does is listen for clicks on .product-gallery, and if the element that triggered it has a class of "bigger" it'll run the function.
[10:04:57] <SpinachHead> Is there a way to detect when a div with a class has a style setting?   Like Can I use jquery if statement to detect when <div class="slideShow" style="left: -700px">   Like how would I detect when left == -700px?
[10:05:21] <BillCriswell> SpinachHead: $el.css('left') === '-700px'
[10:05:48] <SpinachHead> Okay, thanks, I will try.   Need to start a new animation everytime that first slide comes up.
[10:06:03] <BillCriswell> Maybe even check its offset().left.. not sure which would be preferable.
[10:06:15] <SpinachHead> OK
[10:07:08] <elisior> just a sec
[10:09:46] <BillCriswell> SpinachHead: http://paulirish.com/2008/sequentially-chain-your-callbacks-in-jquery-two-ways/ this might interest you
[10:15:19] <sacho> is he using a 2008 copy of jquery?
[10:20:03] <roger_padactor> so in chrome data = jQuery.parseJSON(data);  gets an error but in firefox it works fine.  In chrome I don't need that line of code but in FF I do WTF
[10:21:11] <roger_padactor> I'm returning {"response":true} from a $.post
[10:22:17] <tw2113> nice irc nick
[10:22:44] <elisior> BillCriswell: I think I understand what you're saying, ill give it a try right now, thanks for the tip
[10:22:56] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[10:27:00] <elisior> BillCriswell: it didn't work haha :(
[10:29:35] <maxmoore14> need some jqm advice please - my app is performing well on PC (Chrome/FF/IE10/Safari) and on device (Android 4.1 - Chrome, iPhone5) - 2 problems (likely the same problem)...
[10:30:07] <maxmoore14> the default browser on my android does not format the headers correctly and is causing transition flickering issues
[10:30:47] <maxmoore14> and when I build the app into a phonegap build, I'm getting the same flickering issues
[10:31:07] <Assim_Build> can someone help me figure out why there is such a big difference in behavior between chrome and firefox? http://dot.aquaveo.com/ (login with credentials 'demo' and password 'demo'). In firefox if you click the button labeled "Channel" (it's the top right of the bottom set of buttons above the map) it clicks the show only selected button at the top right which in turn activates an ajax call to update the search. All icons on the map are channels so th
[10:31:11] <maxmoore14> I'm assuming because the default browser and the webview are using the same engine
[10:31:27] <Assim_Build> that button channel is top left, srry not top right
[10:32:59] <maxmoore14> I've done a ton of searching for a solution (perhaps a meta tag setting viewport width & scale?) but I'm wondering if there is a resource for known solutions & best practices
[10:33:30] <maxmoore14> I'm currently using the settings from the jqm template: width=device-width, initial-scale=1
[10:34:44] <Assim_Build> also the code in question is in map.js lines 156-169
[10:35:13] <relipse> how do i have text floating left and right in a jqueryui dialog title bar?
[10:58:38] <elisior> BillCriswell: are you still around? I have no clue why .on() didn't work
[10:59:03] <elisior> There aren't any errors on the console too
[10:59:09] <BillCriswell> elisior: Ah sorry.
[10:59:14] <BillCriswell> Have the link to the page?
[10:59:27] <rindolf> Hi all.
[11:00:02] <rindolf> Why am I getting Â«TypeError: $(...).ready(...) is not a function Â» here - http://www.shlomifish.org/__Beta-kmor/wysiwyt.html ?
[11:00:17] <rindolf> This is after I concatenated the scripts and used yuicompressor.
[11:01:54] <elisior> BillCriswell: sure, here it is http://coyotestore.bootic.net/products/diesel
[11:02:30] <elisior> I was reading the docs in the meanwhile but it looks all good
[11:03:17] <Assim_Build> I don't understand this weird behavior from chrome that works wonderfully in firefox and even ... shudders ... internet explorer. Is there a better approach to make it so show all and show selected is updated based on whether or not all calculator are selected when one of them is clicked and only run the serialize function once? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/bG39h/1/
[11:03:28] <SpinachHead> Strange, I added code to detect when $('.slideShowContainer').css("margin-left") == -'700px') but it never works.  I even tried setting the code in a 1 second setInterval function.  But, the dynamically changing left margin will never get detected.
[11:04:20] <hxm> i have a draggable object, how to avoid move it out of range?
[11:05:25] <foo> Anyone have any tips to simulate website capture on an iphone/android device? I want to, say, write a script that captures 5 websites we have done for portfolio usage
[11:06:27] <BillCriswell> elisior: What's supposed to happen on the second click?
[11:06:54] <elisior> BillCriswell: the image should go back to it's place
[11:07:25] <elisior> BillCriswell: it should do the same thing the + sign and + sign do
[11:08:34] <elisior> BillCriswell: But it's like there's nothing binded to the img, so nothing happens. Tried to catch the click on the console, and didn't work either
[11:13:37] <BillCriswell> elisior: I don't have the time to edit your exact code cause it seems like there's a lot of extra, but here's a bare boned example of what I think you're trying to do: http://jsbin.com/ecinoz/1/edit
[11:14:05] <BillCriswell> Took a slightly different approach as you can see.
[11:14:30] <elisior> BillCriswell: I've set up a really fast jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Dt6WN/
[11:14:59] <BillCriswell> elisior: That link I gave you should help you get it. =)
[11:15:14] <elisior> BillCriswell: but, yeah! That's somewhat similar to what i'm trying to do
[11:16:20] <elisior> BillCriswell: Actually besides doing that, i'm hiding other element of the page and showing them, but I think your approach should work too
[11:16:39] <elisior> BillCriswell: I would really like to know though, what's wrong with my example on the fiddle
[11:18:29] <Assim_Build> can someone help me figure out why this works in every browser but chrome? http://jsfiddle.net/Assimilater/bG39h/5/
[11:20:15] <rindolf> Found it! Had a missing semicolon.
[11:20:34] <Jester86> Does anyone know a way to get 'placeholder' type functionality for Inputs in IE 8?
[11:21:23] <BillCriswell> Jester86: Use a polyfill https://github.com/Modernizr/Modernizr/wiki/HTML5-Cross-Browser-Polyfills
[11:21:53] <Jester86> Thanks Bill looking at it now.
[11:22:04] <BillCriswell> elisior: remove the return false from your first .click .
[11:22:57] <BillCriswell> That'll get you closer, but your logic is still off.
[11:29:21] <jBryan> how can I not insert in my text if json value is 0?
[11:30:07] <BillCriswell> jBryan: Can you ask that questioned a bit differently. Not quite following.
[11:31:45] <JosephSilber> I'm trying to add keyboard navigation to my tables. Here's what I built so far: http://jsfiddle.net/7PqXT/1/
[11:32:09] <JosephSilber> Th eproblem is that since I'm hijacking the arrow keys, the viewport doesn't scroll along.
[11:32:15] <JosephSilber> the problem*
[11:32:41] <JosephSilber> What can I do about that?
[11:34:45] <jasonruhlin> Hi Joseph.. see if this helps: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2168739/using-arrow-keys-with-jquery-scrollto
[11:35:24] <jBryan> BillCriswell: this is the returned json http://jsfiddle.net/PaHhX/, I just want to get rid of 0.0 before I insert it to my element
[11:35:47] <jBryan> zero I mean
[11:37:12] <BillCriswell> That's not JSON. I still don't get what you mean by get rid of 0.0, you want the same thing you have here just with 0.0 removed and "" ?
[11:37:22] <BillCriswell> So "0.0" should become "" ?
[11:38:42] <jBryan> yes I just want to replace it by ""
[11:39:11] <BillCriswell> And your sure your json is EXACTLY that?
[11:39:18] <BillCriswell> you "json" I should say.
[11:39:29] <JosephSilber> jasonruhlin: It actually turned out to be pretty easy: http://jsfiddle.net/7PqXT/2/
[11:39:50] <jBryan> no problem with my json I just want to replace 0.0 with ""
[11:40:03] <NoiseEee> jBryan: that's a pretty basic javascript operation.
[11:40:19] <NoiseEee> jBryan: using the method with the same name as the verb you used
[11:40:31] <NoiseEee> jBryan: so go to it when you're updating your document!
[11:40:34] <BillCriswell> jBryan: Is that just the value of a json property or the whole json object?
[11:40:51] <jBryan> jsut a value of one property
[11:40:55] <jBryan> just*
[11:40:59] <BillCriswell> Oh ok.
[11:41:23] <softEngJason> Nice work Joseph
[11:41:41] <elisior> Thanks BillCriswell ;) I think i'll keep your logic, since it's working perfectly
[11:42:04] <BillCriswell> obj.prop.replace(/"0.0"/g, '') should do the trick jBryan.
[11:42:32] <jBryan> ok I'll try it
[11:42:34] <jBryan> thx :)

[12:03:45] <BillCriswell> Guddu: Instead of doing .append(rowString) do .append(allRowStrings)
[12:04:25] <Guddu> BillCriswell, Thanks I will try that right away.
[12:04:26] <BillCriswell> allRowsString*

[12:05:05] <marcomartins> currect url: http://vimeo.com/65605193
[12:05:06] <BillCriswell> marcomartins: Not sure then. Do you have it live somewhere?
[12:05:45] <BillCriswell> Guddu: Also, doubt it'll make a huge difference, but detail_string=detail_string can simply be detail_string +=
[12:06:10] <BillCriswell> The .append(allRowsString) should hopefully be a noticable difference though.

[12:06:17] <marcomartins> :)
[12:06:34] <marcomartins> the stupid thing here is the documentation not saying it is required the 'iframe'

[12:09:17] <BillCriswell> Glad it's working though ahha
[12:10:11] <marcomartins> jgomes: I've already done like that and it is working but according to the docs it should work with the url being like this http://vimeo.com/65605193 that don't load the top bar with username and avatar etc
[12:10:26] <unstable> thang: Thanks a lot, it works. I appreciate it.
[12:10:52] <madabyss> Hey guys, can I do $('selector').css('background', '//imgpath', function() {... ?
[12:11:22] <hlve> shoky, you there?
[12:11:26] <BillCriswell> madabyss: No.
[12:11:27] <jgomes> marcomartins: but you have any restriction for not using the iframe url?
[12:11:33] <hlve> Rather. BillCriswell. Up for a challenge?
[12:11:36] <BillCriswell> madabyss: What is the function for?
[12:11:42] <BillCriswell> hlve: Why the hell not
[12:11:46] <jgomes> marcogmonteiro: I used the iframe url
[12:11:48] <hlve> Mind if I pm you?
[12:11:52] <BillCriswell> Go for it.
[12:11:53] <marcomartins> jgomes: nop, now I'm just curious :)
[12:12:16] * marcogmonteiro looks at jgomes 
[12:12:17] <madabyss> BillCriswell: I need it to load the contents of the page after the background image is fully loaded (AJAX content). It's a pretty large image.
[12:12:43] <marcomartins> many thanks jgomes BillCriswell unstable
[12:12:47] <Guddu> BillCriswell, This is weird but.....Could there be something that keeps the execution time in Firefox at 20 seconds while on Chrome it is 2 - 4 Seconds?
[12:12:59] <BillCriswell> marcomartins: No problem.
[12:13:12] <BillCriswell> Guddu: Not sure. would need to look at it real close haha
[12:13:18] <Guddu> :)
[12:14:18] <Guddu> 12 - 15 Seconds on IE
[12:14:27] <jgomes> marcogmonteiro: I tryed with a link in your format and doesn't work either
[12:14:59] <BillCriswell> Guddu: Need to load it all at once?
[12:15:44] <Guddu> BillCriswell, Yes. I can't think of another way. I don't know how load on Demand works in case of paginated tables
[12:16:17] <Guddu> The server side code returns 19000 records....IN < 1 Second....Which record will correspond to which page is not known
[12:17:16] <Bloomberg> Hello!!
[12:17:51] <NoiseEee> Guddu: how are you creating the DOM elements?
[12:17:51] <BillCriswell> Pagination is such a weird thing to me. I feel like it's typically useless. A search is so much more helpful in most cases.
[12:17:57] <Bloomberg> I'm using the confirm() popup of js, when I click the cancel I wanna close it without show me something!
[12:18:02] <Bloomberg> How can do it?
[12:18:20] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: what does it show you now???
[12:19:13] <Bloomberg> show me an empty alert then I click the close button!
[12:19:37] <dcherman> Guddu: appending 19k rows ( if that's what you're doing ) is always going to be very slow.  since a user can't feasibly look at 19k rows at once, you might want to rethink how you're presenting this data
[12:20:06] <Guddu> dcherman, Agree
[12:20:30] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: then investigate your code, because that's whats making it happen.
[12:20:51] <NoiseEee> Bloomberg: hitting 'cancel' on a confirm() dialog does what you asked it to do: makes it disappear, shows nothing further.
[12:22:20] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/owulij/1/edit
[12:22:27] <Bloomberg> See that
[12:22:56] <NoiseEee> yeah uh, its doing that because you're specifically asking it to.
[12:23:25] <NoiseEee> if(confirm('are you sure')) { //put EVERYTHING in here }
[12:29:18] <wallerdev> do jquery selectors search through frames by default?
[12:30:36] <BillCriswell> wallerdev: Nope.
[12:30:42] <wallerdev> great, thanks :)
[12:31:26] <SuperTyp> Hello I want to use qtip2 but I have no damn idea how to implement it, could somebody help me please?
[12:31:55] <SuperTyp> I have downloaded it and added it to my html
[12:31:59] <SuperTyp> and now?
[12:32:10] <SuperTyp> I am a newbie with jquery
[12:32:41] <BillCriswell> You apply it using a selector.
[12:32:54] <BillCriswell> Do you know what elements you want it to work on?
[12:33:37] <SuperTyp> yes
[12:33:44] <SuperTyp> I only want it for 1 element
[12:33:52] <SuperTyp> that is tracking my mouseposition in a canvas
[12:35:01] <BillCriswell> Do you know CSS?
[12:35:16] <SuperTyp> I know everything expect of jquery :D
[12:35:46] <BillCriswell> You want to select it just how you would using CSS in most cases. $('.some-class').qtip({ content: { attr: 'someAttribute' }});
[12:36:15] <BillCriswell> It'll use the title attribute by default.
[12:36:36] <BillCriswell> So you can do $('.some-class').qtip(); and it'll grab the title attribute on that element.
[12:36:46] <BillCriswell> http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip2/docs/#create
[12:37:55] <SuperTyp> i have read that already...
[12:38:09] <andkore> how should I submit a form? like what method should I use on the selector selecting my form?
[12:38:37] <BillCriswell> andkore: .trigger() ?
[12:39:40] <andkore> BillCriswell: so that will just submit the form the normal way, but without reloading the page? (if I use event.preventDefault)
[12:40:06] <BillCriswell> That'll submit the form and go to the forms action.
[12:40:29] <BillCriswell> I think... Let me se.e
[12:41:02] <BillCriswell> Yes, it will.
[12:41:35] <andkore> ok, thanks
[12:41:47] <BillCriswell> http://api.jquery.com/trigger/ should clear up a lot.
[12:58:05] <MacDada> Why "my_submit" doesn't have a value? How do I detect which one was clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/MacDada/J9v6y/
[13:00:34] <diverdude> if i do a $.ajax with data:JSON.stringify({startstop:$('#showbatchmodal').attr('data-fromto')}) and i have not put anything into data-fromto, that means the value is undefined. It seems that then instead of sending startstop:undefined to the server then nothing is set at all. Can this really be true?
[13:02:48] <BillCriswell> It could be sent, but that doesn't mean the server can do anything with it.
[13:03:41] <BillCriswell> also, $el.attr('data-foo') might return a blank string.. so { foo: } would be pretty fucked from a computers stand point haha
[13:05:38] <BillCriswell> diverdude: ^^
[13:06:16] <diverdude> BillCriswell, well its not foo:    its foo:undefined
[13:09:34] <NoiseEee> diverdude: iirc it wont pass undefined a key if the value is undefined
[13:09:46] <NoiseEee> kill that first 'undefined' there
[13:09:53] <BillCriswell> diverdude: Are you quoting the properties?
[13:10:02] <diverdude> NoiseEee, yes ok
[13:10:23] <diverdude> BillCriswell, ofc. not. then it would be a string and defined
[13:10:23] <BillCriswell> Ah, it's ok to not quote them.
[13:10:55] <BillCriswell> I was talking about the property, not the value.
[13:12:39] <BillCriswell> JSON.stringify({"foo":undefined}) returns "{}"
[13:13:08] <BillCriswell> As does JSON.stringify({foo:undefined})
[13:13:56] <bn`> hello people. $("#selectorForATag")[0].click(); worked in a newer version of chrome than I have at home where it does not work. is there an alternative to trigger a click on a link?
[13:14:20] <BillCriswell> $('#selectorForATag').trigger('click')
[13:14:23] <bn`> .trigger("click") does not work either
[13:14:52] <bn`> no jquery can only trigger events that were created by jquery afaik
[13:15:02] <diverdude> and true/false is sent as "true"/"false" :(
[13:15:05] <diverdude> Thats bad
[13:15:14] <NoiseEee> bn`: why the [0]?
[13:15:29] <NoiseEee> bn`: you realize that's the bare dom element and not the jquery object?
[13:15:32] <bn`> NoiseEee: because it is the only way it worked ;)
[13:15:33] <BillCriswell> diverdude: JSON.stringify({foo:true}) returns {"foo":true} here.
[13:15:51] <bn`> NoiseEee: yes. that is why it is working. but only in the newer browser version
[13:16:01] <BillCriswell> bn`: That's not true.
[13:16:03] <NoiseEee> bn`: what BillCriswell said.
[13:16:15] <bn`> BillCriswell: that did not work!?
[13:16:27] <NoiseEee> .trigger('click');   or, quite frankly,  functionToRunOnClick()
[13:16:49] <diverdude> BillCriswell, on the server its interpreted as "true"
[13:16:56] <NoiseEee> diverdude: as always.
[13:17:05] <diverdude> NoiseEee, as always?
[13:17:17] <NoiseEee> diverdude: your backend gets those as strings no matter via xhr or a regular form post.
[13:18:42] <bn`> sorry .trigger("click") does not work on a tag
[13:18:52] <diverdude> NoiseEee, hmm ok how do i then send booleans?
[13:19:03] <NoiseEee> search for the string instead?
[13:19:37] <NoiseEee> if($whatever=='true') instead of ($whatever===true)
[13:19:54] <BillCriswell> Have a goodone, dudes.
[13:21:14] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/JFMKT/ @ bn`
[13:22:11] <bn`> NoiseEee: ok here is the point. you define what is happening when the event is triggered.
[13:22:20] <bn`> NoiseEee: but I was talking about an a tag
[13:22:22] <NoiseEee> wat?
[13:22:29] <bn`> <a href="www.google.de">link</a>
[13:22:31] <bn`> nothing more.
[13:22:44] <bn`> no .on() or .click() are used
[13:22:54] <bn`> I just need to click the link
[13:22:56] <NoiseEee> well no, you can't use click() for that.
[13:23:05] <NoiseEee> use any number of window/location redirects.
[13:23:09] <bn`> I need to simulate a click on it. I can not just navigate to the url
[13:23:21] <NoiseEee> bn`: trying to fool some adwords or something are you?
[13:23:37] <bn`> $("#sel")[0].click(); worked in the newer browser version. it really clicked on the link :)
[13:23:52] <NoiseEee> but understand at that point, click() has *nothing* to do with javascript at all.
[13:24:00] <bn`> NoiseEee: no I am writing a bot for a binary options platform. they allow bots, bot there is no api
[13:24:06] <NoiseEee> sorry, nothing to do with *jquery* at all
[13:24:18] <NoiseEee> afaik, click() only worked in FF
[13:24:26] <bn`> NoiseEee: ok yes, but is there a jquery solution for the problem?
[13:24:27] <NoiseEee> clicks are meant for users, is the bottom line.
[13:24:30] <NoiseEee> bn`: no.
[13:24:45] <bn`> it works in the chrome version I use at work ;)
[13:26:50] <NoiseEee> bn`: i guess never upgrade that version of chrome and be sure to always use it when running your script.
[13:28:22] <SuperTyp> what does it mean for me, when firebug tells me that $ is not defined?
[13:28:28] <bn`> well.. thx
[13:28:47] <bn`> SuperTyp: jquery in not loaded
[13:29:17] <bn`> or set to noconflict. so you should use jQuery instead of $
[13:36:58] <relipse> anyone use moment.js?
[13:37:20] <snover> no, nobody, ever.
[13:40:46] <bn`> moment.js looks useful. thx for that
[13:46:00] <Bloomberg> http://jsfiddle.net/VSSBb/
[13:46:08] <Bloomberg> Anybody could help me with this?

[13:46:24] <Bloomberg> each one buttons*
[13:47:23] <SuperTyp> I was searching for a quarter hour
[13:47:57] <SuperTyp> till i found the fault was
[13:48:19] <SuperTyp> scr instead of src _._
[13:53:24] <soee> do you know any script to manipulate styles with media queries ?
[13:57:39] <SuperTyp> I have installed the qtip now but I am not able to test it
[13:58:11] <SuperTyp> I have created a div with id='tooltip' and created another js file with content : $(document).ready(function() {   $('tooltip').qtip({ 	  content: 'Testing shiiiiit'   }); });
[13:58:35] <heedly> http://jsfiddle.net/HdmCj/ -- why do I get "Yes" no matter what I click?
[13:58:38] <SuperTyp> when I hover over that div nothing happens...
[13:58:41] <mashlol> you want `#tooltip`
[13:58:48] <mashlol> # = id
[13:59:36] <ixy26> Hi.  I'm trying to get some Jquery code working inside a Drupal 'behavior'; can't figure out how to test/debug it live since it's "inside" my website.  Anyway, the code's *supposed* to load onto a page (it does), then modifies img sources based on @media query (it doesn't).  Here's the src:  https://drupal.org/node/1990172#comment-7391606.
[13:59:38] <ixy26>   I suspect the 'bind' is off, but not sure -- &/or if something else is wrong in my JQ/JS code.
[13:59:40] <mashlol> heedly: http://jsfiddle.net/HdmCj/1/
[13:59:54] <ixy26> If anyone can spare a sec to take a look, I'd appreciate any help troubleshooting.
[14:00:12] <SuperTyp> ok that solved it
[14:00:24] <SuperTyp> now I got an error in the qtip.js oO
[14:00:49] <heedly> mashlol: thanks :)
[14:00:55] <unstable> I just switched from zepto to jquery mobile.. everything works pretty much the same. There are a couple weird things with css.. though one non-css things is jqm/jq is putting an <h1>loading</h1> into my dom. It doesn't show as far as I can tell.. though with weinre I can see it in the dom.
[14:01:22] <unstable> I read this page: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8313462/jquery-mobile-appends-loading-heading-to-page and it says if I don't have the css added.. it will show the h1 loading. Though I know I have the css added because jqm css is changing how it's displaying. heh
[14:06:45] <madabyss> Hey guys, I'm looking for a clean way to preload a large div background image before ajax content appears. Haven't anything that quite works on the first few pages of google. Any thoughts?
[14:10:54] <SuperTyp> Does anybody use successfully qtip2?
[14:16:21] <funhouse> Hi there just wondering if anyone could help me with jstween?
[14:17:30] <charleston> Hi. var result = $.grep(claims, function(e){ return e.id === 'c0'; }); <- result.length prints as 1 because 'c0' exists, and result[0].id prints as 'c0'. However, if I set the e.id === this.id, result.length prints as 1 and result[0].id prints as undefined. It's obviously finding the object using this.id, so why is the id printing as undefined?
[14:20:26] <Gazpacho> I would expect it's because you really have a claim with an undefined id
[14:21:52] <charleston> Gazpacho I tried printing the array's objects, and they have defined ids
[14:23:04] <charleston> Gazpacho however you might be right, perhaps the id isn't being set correctly
[14:23:45] <charleston> I'm setting the claim ids like this: newClaim.id = 'c'+cCount;
[14:45:48] <nsanden> off topic, but any math wizards in here, i got 50 boxes, one of them has gold inside, i can choose 5 of them. wondering what the probability of getting box with gold in it is
[14:46:01] <stygyan> let me see
[14:46:04] <stygyan> i'm thinking
[14:46:46] <stygyan> http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=probability+to+find+five+boxes+among+fifty
[14:49:18] <nsanden> not seeing anything there
[14:51:02] <Gazpacho> stygan: how many ways can you choose 5 boxes? How many ways can you choose 5 boxes where one of them contains the gold?
[14:52:03] <stygyan> mmh
[14:52:09] <stygyan> i'm looking on google
[14:53:11] <Gazpacho> good luck with that
[14:53:56] <stygyan> for the instructions
[14:54:10] <Gazpacho> if you are choosing 5 boxes where one of them contains the gold, how many boxes are you really choosing?
[14:54:48] <nsanden> 5 boxes from 50
[14:54:51] <stygyan> nope
[14:54:55] <stygyan> 1 box from 50
[14:54:57] <stygyan> 1 box from 49
[14:54:59] <stygyan> 1 box from 48
[14:55:02] <stygyan> 1 box from 47
[14:55:03] <nsanden> right
[14:55:06] <stygyan> and 1 box from 46
[14:55:39] <Gazpacho> with reference to my last question, you're both wrong
[14:56:03] <stygyan> http://www.algebra.com/algebra/homework/Probability-and-statistics/Probability-and-statistics.faq.question.41634.html
[14:56:16] <stygyan> Gazpacho, there's 50 boxes
[14:56:20] <stygyan> you have to find 5
[14:56:24] <stygyan> to choose 5
[14:56:28] <stygyan> 1 of them as gold
[14:56:32] <Gazpacho> yes, I understand that
[14:57:00] <stygyan> you choose 1 of 50, if it has gold you keep on looking
[14:57:05] <stygyan> then it's 1 among 49.
[14:59:16] <nsanden> 1 - (49/50 * 48/49 * 47/48 * 46/47 * 45/46) ?
[14:59:25] <stygyan> oooh
[14:59:26] <Gazpacho> if someone were to tell you exactly where the gold is, and then you had to choose 5 boxes including the one with gold, how many boxes would you really be choosing in that situation?
[14:59:33] <stygyan> four?
[14:59:38] <Gazpacho> correct
[14:59:44] <Hereisanotherlie> I'm trying to perform a get request on http://affiliate.strawberrynet.com/affiliate/cgi/QtyResponse.asp?Prodid=7591 but I keep getting blocked

[14:59:52] <Hereisanotherlie> but I can access it through the browser
[14:59:54] <stygyan> nsanden, have it
[15:00:00] <Hereisanotherlie> is there a way around that?
[15:00:10] <nsanden> are you sure?
[15:00:15] <stygyan> http://www.algebra.com/algebra/homework/Probability-and-statistics/Probability-and-statistics.faq.question.41634.html
[15:00:17] <stygyan> look at this
[15:00:21] <Hereisanotherlie> I tried GET & POST
[15:00:22] <stygyan> it shows how to do it

[15:16:03] <Kelbizzle> LindsayMac: Oops sorry was the wrong link.
[15:16:08] <LindsayMac> Kelbizzle:  to fadein you want to fidst display, then hide and fade in

[15:17:56] <LindsayMac> I didn't remove your other fadein though.. you will want to remove that and keep mine that I added to the <li>
[15:18:32] <LindsayMac> Hereisanotherlie:  also, I am loading jqeury from google cdn
[15:18:32] <Kelbizzle> LindsayMac: I'm sad at how easy that was!
[15:18:39] <LindsayMac> Kelbizzle: :)
[15:18:50] <Kelbizzle> LindsayMac: I guess practice makes perfect.
[15:18:59] <Kelbizzle> LindsayMac: Thanks alot.
[15:19:05] <LindsayMac> Kelbizzle:  you have to think on an element level for that kind of stuff.
[15:19:24] <LindsayMac> if you want to fade in just the <li> you need to associate it to that <li>
[15:19:35] <LindsayMac> you had a fadein on the WHOLE function, which doesnt make logical sense
[15:19:55] <LindsayMac> ALso, in order to fadein yu need to have some type of display property, which does not exist on an element that doesn't exist yet
[15:20:32] <graphettion> Now if you could only figure out your problem LindsayMac, lol
[15:20:33] <LindsayMac> Gazpacho:  do you see the error?
[15:20:41] <Kelbizzle> LindsayMac: that makes sense.
[15:21:01] <LindsayMac> graphettion:  yea.. would be nice, but that is why I am here asking. There is always someone here who is better than myself at this..
[15:21:26] <graphettion> I feel the same way.
[15:21:37] <Gazpacho> no
[15:21:40] <LindsayMac> I'm also much better with javascript animations and display type of stuff than I am more general stuff
[15:21:56] <Hereisanotherlie> I'm the other way around
[15:22:06] <LindsayMac> Gazpacho:  if you launch the url in your browser, you should be able to see it in console
[15:22:14] <LindsayMac> Hereisanotherlie:  well then I would happily help you if you can help me ;)
[15:22:15] <LindsayMac> haha
[15:22:17] <Kelbizzle> I just had one of these moments http://imgur.com/l3aFizL
[15:22:20] <LindsayMac> thats why these rooms WORK
[15:22:27] <Gazpacho> lindsay: i see the error but not the error that causes the error
[15:22:34] <LindsayMac> Ohhh ok.
[15:22:38] <LindsayMac> Gazpacho:  yea. That is where I am stuck!
[15:22:39] <LindsayMac> haha
[15:23:37] <graphettion> In FF, it's line 291 $('form').submit(function()
[15:23:42] <graphettion> (giving more information)
[15:23:52] <LindsayMac> graphettion:  i dont think so... where are you seeing that?
[15:23:53] <graphettion> (if it helps)
[15:24:01] <graphettion> FF developer console
[15:24:04] <LindsayMac> graphettion:  i think you are just seeing a missing image file
[15:24:04] <graphettion> Firebug
[15:24:09] <graphettion> Nope.
[15:24:16] <graphettion> There are two errors.
[15:24:20] <graphettion> Missing file and that.
[15:24:30] <LindsayMac> graphettion:  they are different
[15:25:07] <LindsayMac> ahh ok i see
[15:25:16] <LindsayMac> that is line 291 of tools.js
[15:25:21] <graphettion> Right.
[15:25:31] <LindsayMac> which is causing the error.. which is strange because $ is used before that without an error!
[15:25:57] <graphettion> You're not using  a #?
[15:25:59] <graphettion> ID
[15:26:13] <LindsayMac> graphettion:  this is the core files of a crappy ecommerce
[15:26:15] <LindsayMac> not my choices there
[15:26:29] <graphettion> Well, whoever, lol
[15:26:47] <graphettion> Will #form fix it?
[15:29:31] <LindsayMac> graphettion:  i don't see how it would
[15:30:06] <graphettion> LindsayMac: Thinking of something else. I feel stupid.
[15:30:17] <LindsayMac> no worries
[15:30:43] <graphettion> That's what's throwing the error though, that line. Even in Chrome.
[15:30:46] <graphettion> Line 291
[15:31:52] <LindsayMac> yea well.. it wouldnt make sense if it were not doing it the same across browsers based on the nature of the error
[15:36:57] <LindsayMac> ok so same error popping on in order pages
[15:37:04] <LindsayMac> on this line $(document).ready(function() {
[15:37:23] <LindsayMac> weird thing is that this has always been associated to nocnflict issues as far as I was aware, but I dont have other libraries
[15:41:30] <LindsayMac> Sooo... anyone?
[15:57:25] <Forbidd3n> If a input field is in a div that is hidden, would it return true or false if I did--  if( $('.input').not(':hidden') )...
[15:57:49] <SuperTyp> Does somebody have an idea for a tooltip inside a canvas?
[15:58:59] <Forbidd3n> ?
[16:06:16] <LordThumper> Hi, is there an option to disable the day names "Su, Mo, Tu, We" etc in Datepicker?
[16:06:30] <LordThumper> Or shall I hide the row using css?
[16:18:18] <shennyg> I've got a change event `e` on a select. I can get the value using `e.target.value` is there a way to get the selected options text instead of value?
[16:34:08] <teh> http://jsfiddle.net/vXBHD/
[16:34:08] <teh> why
[16:34:44] <teh> pass by reference doesnt even explain that...
[16:34:47] <mobile8> I am doing an .append to 'head' for a styleshete media='screen and (max-width: 960px)'
[16:34:52] <mobile8> however, IE7,8,9
[16:35:02] <mobile8> all dont read the media argument
[16:35:06] <mobile8> how can this be?
[16:35:40] <coldhead> teh: http://jsfiddle.net/vXBHD/1/
[16:35:54] <coldhead> function scoping, closures etc
[16:36:14] <teh> that..is...sooooo.weird.
[16:36:34] <coldhead> idx = 4 when the loop is finished, so all the on()s see THAT value
[16:36:35] <teh> i get it 100% but i wish it wasnt like that :P
[16:36:41] <coldhead> because it's like "higher up"
[16:36:44] <teh> yeah actually i get that now
[16:36:54] <coldhead> it's not so bad once you get used to it
[16:36:58] <coldhead> there are worse things in life
[16:37:02] <teh> meh, as with everything
[16:37:02] <coldhead> like a woman's love, for instance
[16:37:06] <teh> 'not so bad once you are used to it'
[16:37:15] <teh> i love how i got banned after yesterday
[16:37:19] <teh> that is a seriously douchebag move
[16:37:28] <teh> no humanity left in this world
[16:37:32] <coldhead> it was a slap on the wrist
[16:37:38] <coldhead> and you're back getting help now anyway
[16:37:40] <coldhead> no harm done
[16:37:42] <teh> completely unnecessary
[16:38:06] <coldhead> god i could so go for banning him again
[16:39:01] <shoky> LordThumper: i think css would be the way to go right now. you can also do  dayNamesMin: ['','','','','','','']   but that still puts in a <thead> taking up some space
[16:42:48] <kelbizzle> LindsayMac: Are you still around?
[16:45:00] <LindsayMac> kelbizzle:  i am
[16:45:04] <LindsayMac> sorry someone dropped by the studio
[16:46:44] <kedarm> http://jsfiddle.net/8pqnZ/ is a reasonable way to remove a DOM element, right?
[16:46:51] <coldhead> lol studio
[16:47:36] <kelbizzle> LindsayMac: No worries, earlier you mentioned that I needed to assocate the .fadeIn() with the <li>. I understand what you meant but I'm having a hard time translating it into code.  Can you lend a hand again?
[16:47:49] <kelbizzle> http://jsfiddle.net/rfK5a/15/
[16:50:11] <LindsayMac> kelbizzle:  i gave you working code?
[16:50:33] <kedarm> Somehow, what works on jsfiddle throws an error in "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'origType' of undefined" in jquery.min.js. Any idea?
[16:50:49] <kelbizzle> LindsayMac: yes

[16:53:22] <hugo_moss> hi lindsaymac
[16:53:51] <tw2113> Hi LindsayWin
[16:54:31] <kelbizzle> LindsayMac: I noticed that the entire list fades in and not the idividual li's. So I thought that's what you meant by hacing to associate the .fadeIn() on the li's.
[16:54:44] <kelbizzle> *having
[16:55:18] <LindsayMac> kelbizzle:  i'm sorry.. i can't help right now, but basically its adding the display / fadein to all <li> so you need to specific for each one
[16:55:55] <kelbizzle> LindsayMac: No worries, that makes sense I'll keep working. Thanks again for your help.
[16:56:26] <LordThumper> shoky: Ok thanks alot

[16:57:31] <LindsayMac> kelbizzle:  sorry i couldn't help more. Still working on my issue
[16:57:47] <LindsayMac> bvut basically you want to ONLY trigger than when the append is striggered and only on the current element
[16:57:48] <kelbizzle> LindsayMac: It's quite alright. I understand.

[16:59:55] <LindsayMac> is there anyone in here who can help me with an errorProperty '$' of object [object Object] is not a function   http://bscdeveloper.com/wirerackdemo/shop/index.php?id_product=2&controller=product&id_lang=1
[17:00:13] <LindsayMac> I have jquery loaded before the script is loaded.. i do not see why this is happening to be honest
[17:01:00] <tw2113> kelbizzle, the problem is your fadein is on the ol
[17:01:07] <tw2113> but i think you know that
[17:01:42] <kelbizzle> tw2113: hehe yea lol
[17:02:41] <kelbizzle> I just need to do more reading. I've been working with jquery for literally 8 days.
[17:02:55] <tw2113> literally
[17:03:33] <tw2113> LindsayMac, jQuery().ready(function($)
[17:03:44] <tw2113> tools.js 289
[17:04:33] <LindsayMac> i tried that
[17:05:11] <LindsayMac> and if that is the "fix" that means I have to do that to EVERY SINGLE js file that uses $ - is there a way to fix it throughout?
[17:05:18] <LindsayMac> or make it use $ nad revert back
[17:05:27] <tw2113> it's a noconflict thing
[17:05:35] <LindsayMac> I just dont understand why this is happening considering i'm not using any other things that would cause a confliect
[17:05:39] <LindsayMac> typing FAIL
[17:05:52] <tw2113> WordPress defaults to noConflict
[17:05:59] <hugo_moss> i had the same problem few days ago
[17:06:05] <LindsayMac> this isn't a WP site

[17:06:55] <tw2113> pasting console errors i see
[17:07:18] <hugo_moss> is she using magento?
[17:07:37] <tw2113> dunno
[17:07:40] <LindsayMac> Is there a way to force it from NOT using noconflict?
[17:07:56] <LindsayMac> this whole thing just doesn't make sense to me since i'm not using another library, i have no need for noconflict
[17:08:44] <tw2113> dunno, the noconflict part tends to be my default answer for $ issues
[17:08:48] <tw2113> force of habit
[17:09:15] <tw2113> using jQuery instead of $ is a pretty good way to avoid the issues
[17:09:29] <LindsayMac> I've already been through that though
[17:09:40] <LindsayMac> yea, unless you are using a system that has a TON Of jquery already written in it
[17:09:48] <LindsayMac> I would like to find the cause of the issue

[17:55:06] <hugo_moss> i would get so excited to watch the show
[17:55:18] <hugo_moss> me and my cousin would wait all week for friday for that show
[17:55:37] <hugo_moss> or was it on everyday, i cant remember
[17:57:42] <tw2113> depends on when it entered syndication
[18:02:07] <coldhead> there's other ways to fight torture

[18:14:10] <ProLoser> is it possible to DISABLE toggling of a checkbox by using preventDefault?
[18:14:14] <ProLoser> on the click event?
[18:20:56] <coldhead> it is the damnable bell
[18:24:21] <Gazpacho> ofdsn;r
[18:24:54] <Gazpacho> proloser: if you want to disable a checkbox, then disable it
[18:25:25] <Gazpacho> if you want to style it to make it look like it's not disabled, you can do that
[18:25:52] <Gazpacho> i think
[18:26:02] <Gazpacho> don't see the point of bothering though
[18:26:23] <ProLoser> i want the click event to fire but not the normal behavior
[18:32:58] <BillCriswell> ProLoser: Hmmm..
[18:33:15] <ProLoser> nvm
[18:33:18] <ProLoser> preventDefault() works
[18:33:24] <ProLoser> i was having a weird behavior in some stupid edgecase
[18:37:12] <BillCriswell> ProLoser: Ah, nice.
[18:37:20] <BillCriswell> I got sidetracked that quick.

[19:16:17] <d0100> can jquery get idÅ› that have a Â¨:Â¨ in them, like so: $(Â¨\#something:elseÂ¨)
[19:16:27] <d0100> can jquery get idÅ› that have a Â¨:Â¨ in them, like so: $(Â¨#something:elseÂ¨)
[19:16:31] <d0100> ?
[19:16:46] <coldhead> $('#something\\else')
[19:16:53] <coldhead> $('#something\\:else') // even
[19:19:09] <BillCriswell> I didn't know an id could legally have a : in it.
[19:20:23] <coldhead> IDs can have anything these days
[19:20:34] <d0100> itÂ´s magento...

[19:22:06] <spronk> hi all - qucik q - if I've got a bunch of checkboxes, and I want to show and element if any of them are checked, and hide an element if none of them are checked, how can i do it? http://jsbin.com/aqepar/1 is what i have now
[19:23:56] <BillCriswell> coldhead: Hmm..
[19:24:16] <coldhead> supposedly you can also represent : with \3a
[19:24:21] <coldhead> idk tho
[19:24:31] <spronk> ah, typo, nevermind!
[19:25:00] <BillCriswell> This says "lassnames can contain any character, and they donâ€™t have to start with a letter to be valid.", but http://jsbin.com/oyukoj/1/edit does not work.
[19:25:33] <nesoi> the contents of a textarea are $('#mytextarea').value or .val()?
[19:25:48] <BillCriswell> coldhead: ^^
[19:26:41] <coldhead> BillCriswell: doctype?
[19:26:50] <coldhead> nesoi: .val()
[19:26:59] <coldhead> .value is the native way
[19:27:03] <BillCriswell> coldhead: html5.
[19:27:12] <d0100> thanks guys
[19:28:08] <coldhead> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/oyukoj/2
[19:28:41] <BillCriswell> That seems like a shitty way to have to go about it haha
[19:28:53] <coldhead> yes, the thinking man just uses the olden ways
[19:29:03] <coldhead> but if magento is spewing :s into your IDs
[19:29:06] <coldhead> gotta roll with it

[19:30:47] <nesoi> coldhead:  not .text? Where's the doc on thatâ€¦ I find docs for the textarea but not where to get the contents?
[19:34:01] <coldhead> a textarea is an input
[19:34:03] <coldhead> it has a value

[19:34:34] <Solineoz> Hi all, is there someone who know how to contact the administrator of the jQuery forum ??
[19:38:42] <Solineoz> Someone know how to contact the administrator of the jQuery forum ??
[19:39:30] <BillCriswell> I never even knew there was a jQuery forum.
[19:40:00] <Solineoz> Nice place to get help and learn
[19:40:16] <Solineoz> but has its issues
[19:43:37] <BillCriswell> Solineoz: I'm not sure. =/

[20:36:41] <Aliengel> hi is there a way to fill an article fixed size div(s) , so that once the div is "full", it will fill the next div and so on ?
[20:42:15] <Andrew_R> Aliengel: you could use the css3 property column-width
[20:42:19] <Andrew_R> ? mdn column-width
[20:42:21] <bot-t> Andrew_R, .outerWidth() | jQuery API Documentation - Get the current computed width for the first element in the set of matched elements, including padding and border. http://api.jquery.com/outerWidth/
[20:42:27] <Andrew_R> no...
[20:42:31] <Andrew_R> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/CSS/column-width
[20:42:50] <Andrew_R> not supported in IE until IE 10 though...
[20:44:52] <ruinze> what's the alternative for livequery?
[20:45:49] <Aliengel> Thanks i will take a look
[20:49:10] <jmmy> Ajax doesn't work in IE8/9?
[20:49:19] <tw2113> *head desk*
[20:49:34] <tw2113> yes it does jmmy
[20:49:36] <tw2113> yours doesn't
[20:50:02] <Aliengel> Andrew_R,  thou i still need some way to split and and fill divs dynamically  that cause it will be a used as pagination .
[20:50:27] <jmmy> tw2113, well, I removed preventDefault() and now it works, but the return on sucess block still doesn't execute
[20:50:40] <Andrew_R> Aliengel: ok, I wasn't sure if that would work for you or not
[20:50:41] <tw2113> i don't think that's an ajax issue
[20:50:44] <tw2113> i think that's a js issue
[20:51:03] <jmmy> tw2113, what do you mean?
[20:51:18] <jmmy> tw2113, when I say ajax, I mean the jquery $.ajax() function
[20:51:33] <tw2113> does the code post to your server?
[20:51:37] <tw2113> in IE8/IE9
[20:51:48] <tw2113> not what happens at the end of the success callback
[20:52:12] <Andrew_R> Aliengel: you could split then based on number of characters, but that doesn't necessarily mean that the size will be exactly the same
[20:52:28] <jmmy> tw2113, yes, but then I have a success/fail on return option as is standard, and the success block never executes, but the serverscript definitely runs, cause it is a mail() script, and I get the mail()
[20:52:44] <tw2113> so the ajax half is working
[20:52:58] <tw2113> you just don't know how to prevent default actions on the submit button
[20:53:17] <jmmy> tw2113, no, half the ajax is working, it is running the server script, but it doesn't return
[20:53:34] <jmmy> tw2113, aaaaaah
[20:53:52] <tw2113> what is your php half supposed to return?
[20:54:10] <jmmy> tw2113, that is the difference, preventDefault is removed so the form reloads itself instead and we miss the success block.
[20:54:44] <jmmy> tw2113, its just a mail script.  I have serialize and I get the value, and and send out an email
[20:55:10] <tw2113> have the php half return true on success and false on fail or something
[20:55:32] <jmmy> tw2113, so easy fix is to get rid of <form> and just use on click() button, but I think that is bad practice eh, better to figure out how to preventDefault on both
[20:57:44] <jmmy> how do you preventDefault() on IE 8/9?
[20:58:27] <jmmy> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1000597/event-preventdefault-function-not-working-in-ie
[20:58:32] <jmmy> Thats the solution

[21:41:31] <s2013> anyone here used fancybox?
[22:04:28] <iaj_> Hi there.
[22:05:32] <iaj_> Im trying to get the following   <div class="foo">somestuff</div>   to <div class="foo"><div class="contents">somestuff</div><div class="bar"></div></div>
[22:22:09] <lenswipee> hi, how to check if a HTML tag, say <div class="foo bar baz">, has more than one class?
[22:26:17] <shoky> lenswipee: .prop('className').split(/\s+/).length
[22:27:31] <lenswipee> don't follow the .split(/\s+/)
[22:27:51] <lenswipee> what is /\s+/
[22:28:21] <lenswipee> .split(" ").length perhaps?
[22:28:50] <shoky> \s+ means one or more whitespace chars
[22:29:16] <shoky> regex
[22:29:54] <lenswipee> .split(" ").length <-- will this work, no regex solution?
[22:31:01] <shoky> try it and see
[22:32:37] <lenswipee> how to use bot here for .split
[22:32:48] <coldhead> ?eval 'foo   aids      bar'.split(' ')
[22:32:52] <bot-t> coldhead: ["foo", "aids", "bar"]
[22:32:57] <lenswipee> i'm guessing .split takes regex
[22:33:05] <coldhead> ?eval 'foo   aids      bar'.split(/\s+/)
[22:33:06] <bot-t> coldhead: ["foo", "aids", "bar"]
[22:33:38] <lenswipee> both work, so which one is better?
[22:33:44] <lenswipee> :)
[22:34:13] <lenswipee> I know which one is better in terms of readability.
[22:34:19] <lenswipee> How about speed?
[22:35:19] <coldhead> ?optimisation
[22:35:19] <bot-t> The First Rule of Program Optimization: Don't do it. The Second Rule of Program Optimization (for experts only!): Don't do it yet.
[22:37:24] <lenswipee> coldhead: thank you for reminding me kind sir.
[22:38:32] <eLenoAr> ^^
[22:44:51] <coldhead> i'm glad we had this chat
[22:48:18] <lenswipee> coldhead: me too.
[22:49:18] <lenswipee> coldhead: Have you learnt anything new today buddy?
[22:49:47] <kevireilly> this is his first day here
[22:52:58] <lenswipee> kevireilly: Fair enough.
[22:54:04] <kevireilly> lenswipee: i just kidding, dood is legendary ;) and my favorite thing is when he says what i said
[22:55:25] <lenswipee> kevireilly: Wow! that is awesome man.
[22:56:22] <kevireilly> lenswipee: how are you doing today?
[22:57:14] <lenswipee> kevireilly: I'm still alive so can't complain too much. How about you?
[22:58:10] <kevireilly> lenswipee: Excellent. I'm OK. Long day, can't wait for a repeat tomorrow
[22:59:15] <lenswipee> kevireilly: Awesome. Hopefully, I have a chance to see the new Star Trek movie.
[22:59:43] <lenswipee> kevireilly: It will be a real treat!
[23:00:23] <kevireilly> yeah I liked the last one, hopefully this one will dopie dope as well
[23:00:25] <motaka2> Cork: Are you there ?
[23:01:32] <coldhead> i've got Cork's cell phone number if that's any help
[23:01:38] <coldhead> i copied it from a bathroom wall
[23:01:45] <coldhead> but it said "NO TIME WASTERS"
[23:02:21] <lenswipee> coldhead: so it's true about the aids then ;)
[23:03:35] <coldhead> nothing is true
[23:03:39] <coldhead> everything is permitted
[23:04:44] <motaka2> coldhead: :)
[23:05:10] <lenswipee> kevireilly: It would be awesome if they made the movie about the Borg.
[23:06:09] <motaka2> I have a java script file and some javascript in the body to work with that file, i call the javascript file in ajax. but ut seems some times the html is ajaxed sooner that the javascript file, so I get errors, what is the solution ?
[23:08:46] <coldhead> hard to tell exactly what you're talking about but you might be able to use the success() handler of your ajax() call to run some code only when the ajax transaction is complete
[23:09:01] <coldhead> and if you want code to run only when BOTH are complete then you should learn Promises
[23:09:46] <coldhead> it was great chatting to you, motaka2
[23:09:48] <coldhead> come back any time
[23:10:10] <shoky> dopie dope
[23:10:27] <motaka2> coldhead: :) I use thunderbird to chat, if you dont name me I get no notifications
[23:10:32] <lenswipee> what do you mean by BOTH?
[23:11:06] <lenswipee> shoky: First time I heard dopie dope
[23:11:25] <shoky> mine too
[23:12:03] <coldhead> great chat everyone
[23:12:07] <coldhead> let's all take a short break
[23:12:13] <motaka2> coldhead: I considered using success. but for each http request I have several js files to load. so I need to use several getScript in a loop , so I have to include the html when ?
[23:12:52] <coldhead> i couldn't say, it's my first day using jQuery
[23:14:26] <kevireilly> <3
[23:17:13] <motaka2> coldhead: :)
[23:17:17] <coldhead> do you want to show us the code, motaka2?
[23:17:19] <coldhead> might help
[23:26:35] <motaka2> coldhead: the php side:   http://pastebin.com/3b92Vtat   and the jquery side   http://pastebin.com/7fRs9H3a
[23:32:44] <coldhead> ew
[23:32:55] <coldhead> what i would do is just load all the javascript i need initially
[23:33:03] <coldhead> mabe in different functions for each page
[23:33:11] <coldhead> and then if i ajaxed in the HTML
[23:33:14] <coldhead> when that was success
[23:33:19] <coldhead> i'd called the appropriate fn
[23:33:25] <coldhead> but that's just me
[23:36:15] <coldhead> i am, after all, basically a fat lazy idiot
[23:39:56] <motaka2> coldhead: I didnt get u
[23:53:11] <coldhead> WELL JUST FUCK OFF THEN MOTAKA2
[23:53:21] <coldhead> THAT'S FINE
[23:53:32] <coldhead> I DIDN'T JUST DO A FIDDLE FOR YOU OR ANYTHING
[23:53:40] <coldhead> LEAVE ME LIKE EVERY WOMAN I HAVE EVER LOVED
[23:56:02] <ravenzz> ..
[23:56:45] <Gatito`K> jQuery draggable does not work with DIV element that have CSS rule "behavior:url(border-radius.htc);" - is there fix fot this or any suggestions?
[23:56:55] * ravenzz gives coldhead a tampon
[23:57:38] <ravenzz> and a hug
[23:58:48] <ravenzz> Gatito`K are you 100% sure that it is because of border-radius.htc?
[23:59:31] <Gatito`K> without this line of code i can move my DIV arround page (this happpens only on IE8)
