[00:02:56] <jaccob> Cork, thx
[00:42:25] <prohobo> hi, im having trouble with jquery's JSON implementation
[00:43:48] <systemfault> More info.
[00:43:59] <prohobo> yeah actually nvm for now :P
[00:44:03] <prohobo> i might have an idea
[00:45:49] <prohobo> okay
[00:46:19] <prohobo> so i have user input string, these strings can include double quotations,brackets,etc
[00:46:43] <prohobo> i parse this to JSON and stringify it to store in a string, but now... i can't retrieve the JSON objects from the string
[00:46:57] <prohobo> because if i parse that string again it'll remove my escaped characters
[00:47:24] <systemfault> prohobo: Do you have some example? Perhaps on jsfiddle :/
[00:51:34] <prohobo> god, it's gonna take a while to create an example
[01:03:19] <prohobo> damn it
[01:03:19] <prohobo> http://jsfiddle.net/vo65wb5e/1/
[01:03:26] <prohobo> wrote the jsfiddle and the fiddle works fine
[01:04:26] <Cork> prohobo: you shouldn't do '{"value":"' + $(this).val().replace(/"/g, '\\\"')
[01:04:30] <Cork> use JSON.stringify
[01:05:09] <Cork> and i would recommend to use $.map instead of the str variable
[01:08:06] <Cork> prohobo: http://jsfiddle.net/vo65wb5e/3/
[01:09:53] <prohobo> cool ty
[01:09:55] <prohobo> ill try it
[01:10:13] <Cork> prohobo: basically you should never build json by hand
[01:11:40] <prohobo> will the way you wrote the $.map section work like the each()?
[01:12:36] <Cork> kinda
[01:12:47] <Cork> $.map returns an array with the value returned in the function callback
[01:12:58] <Cork> so the $.map here returns an array with objects
[01:13:07] <Cork> and the objects are { value: .val() }
[01:13:13] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/vo65wb5e/4/
[01:13:22] <Cork> ^ this one skips empty fields
[01:14:24] <mooncup> does datatables have a way to refresh its counts etc?
[01:14:47] <Cork> prohobo: and if you are ok with [] instead of {} for empty http://jsfiddle.net/vo65wb5e/5/
[01:15:08] <prohobo> i need the map to work on all input fields
[01:15:13] <prohobo> can be like 10
[01:15:24] <prohobo> and im kinda confused by how it works
[01:15:25] <Cork> it should
[01:15:32] <prohobo> alright
[01:15:39] <Cork> prohobo: $() finds all .user-input elements
[01:15:46] <prohobo> until it doesn't
[01:15:48] <Cork> .filter removes those with an empty value (optional)
[01:15:57] <Cork> $.map then loops over those elements
[01:16:03] <Cork> and grabs the .val() from those
[01:16:06] <prohobo> cool
[01:16:07] <Cork> and puts it into an object
[01:16:20] <Cork> an array of all those objects are then built
[01:16:27] <Cork> and the array is then converted to json
[01:16:39] <Cork> and put into $json-field
[01:17:25] <Cork> prohobo: and an updated version where #output-field is reset so it works if there is no objects http://jsfiddle.net/vo65wb5e/6/
[01:22:57] <prohobo> thanks a bunch cork
[01:28:11] <prohobo> got it working now

[01:47:13] <fRAiLtY-> Anyone ever used ekko lightbox for bootstrap?
[02:15:34] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to change an attribute but it not works. Anyone can help me please? http://jsfiddle.net/vcdyhzt1/
[02:20:31] <sahbeewah> abailarri: read through your code very carefully and see what it is doing every time you click
[02:20:40] <PatBateman> hi
[02:21:03] <PatBateman> is there a comparison chart about speed of jquery functions?
[02:21:39] <abailarri> sahbeewah, when ajax is succes, it change data-limit to 6
[02:22:06] <abailarri> but when I click another time on moreUsers, the script gets 3 in data-limit
[02:22:12] <abailarri> I don't understand why
[02:22:36] <sahbeewah> abailarri: sorry misread your code, okay here’s why
[02:23:03] <sahbeewah> because setting the data-limit attribute doesn’t update jquery’s data cache
[02:24:14] <sahbeewah> jquery’s .data() method does this: 1. reads the internal data table maintained by jquery to check if there’s a corresponding key i.e. “limit”, if there isn’t, it falls back to checking if there’s a data-key attribute on the element
[02:24:31] <sahbeewah> it then moves that value into the internal data table
[02:25:19] <abailarri> and what can I do?
[02:26:54] <sahbeewah> well, the most common solution is to use $("#moreUsers”).data(‘limit’, limit); instead of attr(‘data-limit’…
[02:27:48] <sahbeewah> so, do that i guess
[02:28:15] <abailarri> yes sahbeewah works fine
[02:28:17] <abailarri> thanks!!

[02:58:27] <solomax> Hello All, I would like to ask question related to draggable/containment. I have fixed toolbar with droppable element and scrollable div with draggable items. It seems to be impossible to drag item to toolbar (even if containment is set to outer div including everything) Is this expected behavior? Maybe there is workaround I can use?
[03:02:36] <bracky> does anyone know how I could achieve this? http://i.imgur.com/ZnmYsLX.png
[03:04:21] <bracky> here's a pastie: http://pastie.org/pastes/9541615/text
[03:07:38] <prohobo> bracky isn't that serialization?
[03:07:48] <prohobo> oh nvm
[03:08:13] <bracky> prohobo: yes
[03:08:54] <prohobo> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowBase64.btoa
[03:09:25] <bracky> prohobo: isn't that just for strings?
[03:09:53] <prohobo> and you want the bytecode of the file?
[03:12:06] <prohobo> i dont know
[03:15:08] <bracky> prohobo: http://i.imgur.com/lUhZFuy.png
[03:15:10] <bracky> i want the base64 representation of the file
[03:17:14] <bracky> image, not file*
[03:47:41] <mooncup> I'm sure I'm being a moron
[03:47:46] <mooncup> http://pastie.org/private/daqmtr6ra38c0gx6gydtnw
[03:47:53] <mooncup> but basically that should only add one text area to a field
[03:48:06] <mooncup> however clicking in the text area seems to cause the event to be triggered every time
[03:51:00] <Cork> mooncup: $() runs a selector
[03:51:06] <Cork> builds a list of elements matching the selector
[03:51:17] <Cork> .click then adds an event handler to each of those elements in the list
[03:51:28] <Cork> so adding or removing classes won't affect the list
[03:51:40] <Cork> what you want to do is use delegated event listeners instead
[03:52:10] <Cork> $('parent-element-selector').on('click', '.note-text:not(.hasText)', func)
[03:52:20] <Cork> then the addClass would have the effect your after
[03:53:16] <Cork> alternatively you can do $('.note-text').click(function() { if($(this).hasClass('hasText')) { return } ... });
[03:53:40] <Cork> though i would recommend the first solution if you have more then one note-text element
[04:25:19] <piyushparkash> what will attr return if attribute doesn't exist
[04:25:53] <Cork> ''
[04:26:25] <piyushparkash> Should it be undefined?
[04:26:26] <Cork> attr always returns a string
[04:26:35] <Cork> by spec no
[04:26:40] <piyushparkash> ok
[04:26:47] <Cork> attr is a shorthand for elm.getAttribute
[04:27:24] <piyushparkash> any function to check if attribute exists?
[04:27:42] <Cork> piyushparkash: hmm correction
[04:27:52] <Cork> looks like attr and prop does return undefined
[04:27:54] <Cork> interesting
[04:28:11] <piyushparkash> When the attr doesn't exist?
[04:28:17] <Cork> yes
[04:28:44] <piyushparkash> Then it is good.
[04:41:16] <karstenk1977_> hi
[04:42:03] <karstenk1977_> whats wrong with: var main = jQuery('#main');             main.load(href + "#main > *");  ??? why I get not only the content of id main in id main, but all with header and other elements?
[04:42:24] <Cork> karstenk1977_: your missing a space
[04:42:50] <Cork> http://www.example.com/path/file.html#main > *
[04:43:16] <Cork> karstenk1977_: though that said, you should try to do that filtering server side instead
[04:44:45] <karstenk1977_> where i miss a space?
[04:45:31] <karstenk1977_> ah ok
[04:49:46] <no_gravity> Another day of startup hustle!
[04:50:44] <no_gravity> How do you add a "when the input field loses focus" handler these days? .blur(), .focusout(), on("blur"...) ?
[04:50:51] <mooncup> ah cheers Cork
[04:50:56] <mooncup> didn't realise it worked that way
[04:51:39] <solomax> Hello, I'm trying to make this http://jsbin.com/sakiz/9/ code work, can someone plese help me?
[04:53:12] <no_gravity> solomax: define "make work"
[04:54:06] <solomax> it is impossible to drag "draggable" to trash (droppable). Containment seems not work
[04:56:11] <solomax> Thanks for the response :) Maybe it can be redesigned somehow?
[04:58:20] <no_gravity> solomax: the list has overflow hidden
[04:58:30] <no_gravity> solomax: so you cannot get anything out of it
[05:00:14] <solomax> Is there any other possibility to make scrollable list and droppable target available? I tried with "fixed" position of droppable div and it also not working
[05:00:50] <solomax> Maybe any workaround?
[05:03:26] <no_gravity> solomax: maybe put the trash in the list.
[05:03:54] <solomax> It will be scrolled :(
[05:04:14] <solomax> The idea was to make it available without too much scrolling
[05:05:14] <no_gravity> solomax: well, invest some time tinkering
[05:05:54] <solomax> thanks
[05:12:04] <solomax> no_gravity: just commented out "overflow-x:hidden;" - same effect, not working :(
[05:13:47] <no_gravity> solomax: sorry, i dont use jquery a lot and i never used jquery-ui, so i don't know.
[05:14:16] <solomax> no_gravity: OK, thanks, sorry
[05:20:45] <mooncup> what's the cleanest way to trigger an event when a user clicks outside an element?
[05:20:57] <mooncup> I've done a bit of google
[05:20:58] <mooncup> ing
[05:21:17] <mooncup> but I don't really like the event.stopPropagation method
[05:21:25] <mooncup> it seems like it could have weird side effects
[05:26:05] <guzzlefry> mooncup: Can you use an overlay?
[05:26:25] <mooncup> potentially
[05:26:31] <mooncup> would it have any side-effects?
[05:27:34] <guzzlefry> I'm not sure. >_>
[05:31:55] <mooncup> http://css-tricks.com/dangers-stopping-event-propagation/ aha!
[05:36:52] <palzie> hey, i made a plugin that displays a dialog box in the right bottom corner. it can be minimized aswell. what i would like to do is to keep the user preference, which means that if he minimizes it on the frontpage and he goes to another page, it's still minimized. is this possible ?
[05:38:28] <wodim> how do i get a list of nodes that do not have a certain attr? does $("a[!src]") work for example?
[05:39:02] <wodim> well it does not
[05:41:07] <Cork> wodim: :not([src])]
[05:41:11] <wodim> thanks
[05:41:28] <Cork> <a src="">?!?
[05:41:34] <wodim> no, just an example
[05:41:38] <Cork> good ^^'
[05:51:21] <wodim> if i do $("a") i get all anchors, but how do i get the first one of them, because $("a")[0] does not return a jquery object
[05:52:00] <Cork> .first() or .eq(0)
[05:52:22] <wodim> thank you again
[05:52:37] <gurke_> cork++
[05:52:49] <patryk__> if you just need the first one, and no other you can also do "a:first"
[05:53:44] <Cork> patryk__: :first is a sizzle way to call .first()
[05:54:09] <sash_> wodim: http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ interesting read.
[05:55:22] <patryk__> Cork: i see
[05:55:42] <patryk__> Cork: i thought it's a standard css selector
[05:55:46] <patryk__> my fault
[05:55:50] <Cork> no
[05:56:02] <Cork> that would be :first-child
[05:56:07] <Cork> but :first-child != :first
[05:56:32] <patryk__> yeah
[06:02:44] <palzie> sorry to reiterate x: i made a plugin that displays a dialog box in the right bottom corner. it can be minimized aswell. what i would like to do is to keep the user preference, which means that if he minimizes it on the frontpage and he goes to another page, it's still minimized. is this possible ?
[06:03:05] <Nomikos> cookies!
[06:03:20] <drej> mm cookies
[06:03:31] <Nomikos> palzie: https://github.com/carhartl/jquery-cookie
[06:03:51] <palzie> nomnom. alright thx
[06:04:08] <Guest83992> hi guys
[06:04:27] <Guest83992> hope you can help me as I looked everywhere but couldn't find a solution for this issue
[06:06:12] <krambiorix> can i check if text in a table cell overflows the table cell?
[06:08:59] <Cork> krambiorix: short answer; no
[06:09:15] <palzie> Nomikos: btw, i'm really not sure about how it works, it has "name" and "value" as parameters; how can i set properties with this ?
[06:09:39] <Cork> long answer: not really, you can copy the text into a span measure the spans width and then compare that width to the table cells width
[06:09:40] <palzie> is this like myDiv.cookie("name","val")   that gotta be created or ?
[06:09:55] <Cork> krambiorix: though that doesn't handle line breaks
[06:10:13] <Nomikos> palzie: you choose a name for the state of whether a user has minimized the box, and the value can be true or false
[06:10:31] <Nomikos> palzie: but since it's a cookie and they don't support booleans, 1 or 0 is better
[06:11:10] <Nomikos> palzie: and you don't tie the cookie to a specific element, it's tied to the domain automatically
[06:11:18] <krambiorix> Cork, thanks!
[06:12:12] <killa_kyle> If I have a panel open and then try to open one below it, it flies off the screen, how can I make the viewport follow it properly?
[06:12:14] <killa_kyle> http://www.killakyle.com/designCC/index.html
[06:12:31] <Guest83992> hi guys hope you can help me with a problem I'm having. I'm going to copy the below code and explain my problem:
[06:12:34] <killa_kyle> I'm just learning so even telling me what to google helps
[06:12:42] <Guest83992> <?php   if(isset($_REQUEST['edit_upload']))  {    echo "<script>  			var imageNum = 'pic1';  			//alert(imageNum);  			var result = $.ajax({  				type: 'POST',  				url: '../ajax.php',  				data: 'work=removeUpload&image=' + imageNum,  				async: false  			}).responseText.split(','); 			location.href = 'uploadimage.php';  </script>";  ?>
[06:13:08] <Guest83992> the location.href at the end is giving me loading problems with chome (only on version 37+)
[06:13:24] <drej> Guest83992 generally speaking, in this channel you would put together a test case showing your problem
[06:13:27] <drej> using jsfiddle.net or the like
[06:13:27] <Guest83992> what I want to do is to know how I can replace it with something like header("Location:
[06:13:30] <drej> and not paste php into the channel
[06:13:34] <Guest83992> oh
[06:13:36] <drej> in fact, dont ever paste code in the channel
[06:13:41] <Guest83992> I did not know
[06:13:43] <drej> if you set up a test case, people can tinker with it and show you
[06:13:45] <drej> its cool, no biggie
[06:13:57] <drej> (it is in the topic however) :)
[06:14:10] <Guest83992> actually this is the first time I ever in this type of chat
[06:14:39] <drej> thats cool, not trying to give you a hard time, just giving you some direction so you can get help
[06:14:41] <Nomikos> welcome to irc!
[06:14:54] <Guest83992> http://jsfiddle.net/pvaknmbr/
[06:15:09] <Guest83992> thanks
[06:15:36] <Guest83992> I just looking for a way to do the same thing but not using echo script and location.href
[06:15:41] <palzie> Nomikos: alright, gimme a sec
[06:15:48] <drej> Guest83992 one further note, the point of a test case is to provide a working example of your problem
[06:15:53] <drej> ie, extrude the js from the php
[06:15:59] <drej> and make it work or throw the error you're getting
[06:16:01] <drej> in that jsfiddle
[06:16:06] <drej> otherwise its hard to debug
[06:16:20] <Guest83992> I know, but I cannot provide that :(
[06:16:57] <Guest83992> what I can say is we had this problem on other pages and we solve it by replacing it with something like header("Location:  xxx.php ");
[06:17:23] <Guest83992> but its not possible to put an header(location: inside the script, at least not that I'm aware off
[06:17:39] <Guest83992> so any pointers would be GREAT as I have no clue what to do
[06:19:43] <drej> Guest83992 maybe someone else can hop in and help out, im not following personally
[06:19:52] <drej> you can also try asking in #web which is a little more generic and not so jquery focused
[06:19:57] <drej> they'd be able to sift through the php as well
[06:20:19] <Nomikos> .. good luck, there!
[06:20:22] <Guest83992> ok I will give it a try
[06:20:22] <palzie> Nomikos: so ye sorry, got all the work to do at the same time ... so ye, how do I tell like the cookie named "toto" concerns whether the box is minimized or not (i'm using toggleClass to do the "minimized" effect)
[06:20:28] <Guest83992> thx
[06:21:08] <palzie> Nomikos : i mean i get the purpose of this plugin but I can't figure out how it works
[06:21:14] <Nomikos> palzie: when you minimize it, you set cookie toto to 0, $.cookie('toto', 0); and when it's shown again, set it back to 1
[06:21:19] <Nomikos> something like that?
[06:21:39] <Nomikos> and on the load of the page, check the cookie, set style/css accordingly
[06:21:46] <palzie> Nomikos: oh...
[06:21:49] <palzie> i guess i got it
[06:21:53] <palzie> i think*
[06:22:03] <Nomikos> in spite of my grammar o.o
[06:22:20] <palzie> Nomikos: not like mine was good either
[06:22:21] <BillCriswell> Guest83992: What is your goal here? It looks like you want to send off that ajax request then redirect, right?
[06:22:30] * Nomikos still drinking coffee
[06:22:43] <Guest83992> well yes
[06:22:56] <Guest83992> but the thing is its loading some of the header which gets all messed up
[06:23:14] <Guest83992> we had this showing on other pages (without ajax)
[06:23:25] <Guest83992> and we fix it by going with the header("Location: solution
[06:24:06] <Guest83992> and its only showing on chrome 37 and it did not show up a month ago
[06:24:23] <Guest83992> so im guessing its a browser issue, but it can be fixed with a different approach (like header("Location:)
[06:25:01] <BillCriswell> Guest83992: What's the deal with the responseText, what is that being used for?
[06:26:11] <bumbar_> is "{'status': 'ok'}" not a valid json? $.parseJSON says there's a syntax error
[06:26:21] <BillCriswell> bumbar_: " not '
[06:26:25] <prohobo> double quotes
[06:26:46] <Guest83992> im not a developer :(  but it has nothing to do with it, as if I remove everything inside the script , and just leave the "location.href" I will get the same issue
[06:27:23] <BillCriswell> Guest83992: I had a feeling the ajax part was a red herring haha
[06:28:06] <BillCriswell> Very interesting, by the way: http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/30239/where-does-the-phrase-red-herring-come-from
[06:29:16] <Guest83992> from what I tested the problem is just with the echo "<script> location.href =
[06:29:49] <Guest83992> as if I remove all of the ajax the redirect still give the same issue. even if I remove only this line but leave all of the ajax, then no issue

[07:23:37] <BillCriswell> Jaq: https://www.ssbbartgroup.com/blog/2013/07/03/jquery-ui-accessibility-analysis/ looks useful.
[07:24:23] <Jaq> BillCriswell, thanks! Will have a look. :)
[07:58:07] <zeroquake> when u use a selector , it returns only that particular node?
[07:58:14] <zeroquake> not the children ?
[07:58:37] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: The children are inside the node you selected yes.
[07:59:07] <zeroquake> so i assign a selector to a variable
[07:59:22] <zeroquake> i change something on its children on it dom
[07:59:37] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: Right right.
[07:59:46] <zeroquake> if i am using the stored selector , i shudnt be able to to detect these changes right?
[08:00:30] <zeroquake> i think i had it wrong till now
[08:00:31] <zeroquake> http://jsfiddle.net/
[08:00:35] <rgman> zeroquake: Yes, you should.
[08:00:44] <zeroquake> http://jsfiddle.net/9L84Lh7c/
[08:00:47] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: You can. I feel like I might be missing something though.
[08:01:21] <zeroquake> so all a selector returns is only that matching node , not the children or anything other.
[08:01:31] <rgman> Every change you made to a DOM element it's visible in every selector.
[08:01:38] <rgman> zeroquake: Yes, that's right.
[08:02:01] <zeroquake> I cant believe i am one year into web dev not knowing this
[08:02:39] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: Are you expecting the blah 3 to still be there in x since you didn't remove it specifcally from x?
[08:02:39] <rgman> But if you change something in it's children, you should be able to see that change from every other selector pointing at that element.
[08:03:20] <zeroquake> BIllCriswell -. yes , i was under the assumption selector stores the entire state of matching node
[08:04:38] <zeroquake> as you can see above , when i do x.find("blah3") again , it does another selector for the entire div and then finds blah3 in its children?
[08:06:01] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: If your goal is to create a copy of the element at that time you can use .clone().
[08:07:34] <zeroquake> yup. thank you.
[08:15:40] <SniperH4x0r> how do i make a js fadein run only after another fadein has been completed?
[08:15:59] <SniperH4x0r> for instance i have an image that fades in and some text within that image that fades in
[08:16:12] <SniperH4x0r> but when the cache has been cleared the image loads in after the text
[08:16:25] <BillCriswell> zeroquake: No problem.
[08:16:44] <SniperH4x0r> i want the image to always load in before the text loads in
[08:16:52] <BillCriswell> SniperH4x0r: You can use the callback for fadeIn()
[08:17:11] <rgman> SniperH4x0r: The $(..).fadeIn method has a callback option.
[08:17:16] <SniperH4x0r> BillCriswell: i'm not familiar with that
[08:17:31] <rgman> SniperH4x0r: Check the online docs. http://api.jquery.com/fadein/
[08:18:02] <SniperH4x0r> thats what im reading
[08:18:06] <SniperH4x0r> but i dont seem to understand
[08:18:19] <SniperH4x0r> all that i need to do is add :first to my jquery selector?
[08:18:39] <BillCriswell> SniperH4x0r: What?
[08:19:02] <rgman> For instance. $('#img1').fadeIn(400, function() { $('#img2').fadeInt(); }));
[08:19:08] <BillCriswell> SniperH4x0r: You can use $(window).on('load', function () { /* This runs when images are loaded, then you can do... */  $img.fadeIn('slow', function () { $text.fadeIn('fast'); }); });
[08:19:25] <BillCriswell> rgman: Haha
[08:19:53] <rgman> SniperH4x0r: The second parameter is a closure that runs when the fade in event of #img1 is finished.
[08:20:54] <SniperH4x0r> ok i think this makes sense now thanks
[08:21:16] <rgman> SniperH4x0r: I wrote an extra bracket there.. Sorry about that..
[08:21:17] <rgman> $('#img1').fadeIn(400, function() { $('#img2').fadeInt(); });
[08:23:09] <SniperH4x0r> actually i dont think i needed the callback just needed to wrap my fadeins with that $(window).on('load'....
[08:23:32] <SniperH4x0r> the window on load is okay to put in a document.ready?
[08:23:43] <SniperH4x0r> and it happens after the document.ready?
[08:24:03] <rgman> SniperH4x0r: You coul simply use $(function() { ... });
[08:24:28] <SniperH4x0r> huh?
[08:24:36] <SniperH4x0r> in replace of the window on load?
[08:24:43] <Guest37833> hello, is there any performance hit for having multiple resize binds?
[08:26:35] <rgman> They are not exactly the same, but you could use $(document).ready.
[08:27:14] <BillCriswell> rgman: $(function(){}); doesn't wait for images.
[08:27:28] <rgman> According to the online docs, ready() will run when the HTML is ready.
[08:27:30] <BillCriswell> $(window).on('load', ...); was specifically chosen haha.
[08:27:40] <BillCriswell> rgman: Yes.
[08:27:47] <BillCriswell> That doesn't mean the images are loaded though.
[08:28:02] <SniperH4x0r> ^
[08:28:11] <SniperH4x0r> thats why i was confused by what you said rgman
[09:00:37] <krasimir> hi all , I am using the script from http://hayageek.com/docs/jquery-upload-file.php and it return an object with the filename and fileId - how do I get the fileId from this ? if I use JSON.stringify it returns : [{"nameFile":"notes.txt","idFile":"7"}]
[09:09:30] <unsigned_long> hello
[09:09:48] <unsigned_long> by using the web version of jquery firefox produces some "unrecognized expression" error
[09:09:50] <unsigned_long> http://www.mental-math-trainer.com/
[09:10:08] <unsigned_long> this syntax error only appears in FF and Safari. It works still well in Chrome and Opera
[09:10:32] <unsigned_long> is this "normal" and expected behaviour ?
[09:14:01] <BillCriswell> unsigned_long: It looks you a selector you used it just bad.
[09:14:34] <unsigned_long> BillCriswell: what exactly do you mean?
[09:14:45] <unsigned_long> the error comes from a jquery.min.js hosted online, right?
[09:15:12] <BillCriswell> Yes, but I think it's an issue from something else.
[09:15:35] <unsigned_long> How can we nail it down?
[09:16:02] <BillCriswell> Trying to figure that out now.
[09:17:02] <BillCriswell> Are you selecting something with [data-toggle= somewhere in your code?
[09:17:32] <BillCriswell> unsigned_long: Ah, setup.js
[09:17:44] <BillCriswell> LIne 60: $("[data-toggle=tooltip").tooltip(); should be $("[data-toggle=tooltip]").tooltip();
[09:20:08] <unsigned_long> BillCriswell: pretty impressive. Thank you! :)
[09:20:14] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[09:20:52] <andrewas> I am trying to use datepicker, but if I clear the fields, then go back to the input, the datepicker does not display
[09:23:30] <BillCriswell> andrewas: Are you ajaxing in the input after it's clearned or something weird?
[09:23:38] <andrewas> yes
[09:23:50] <andrewas> well not sure if it is weird, but the clearing is ajax
[09:24:07] <andrewas> its in salesforce/visualforce
[09:24:58] <andrewas> but I have a js function that runs after the controller function is complete to $j.datepicker._clearDate('.endorseDate');
[09:25:06] <BillCriswell> andrewas: That's the issue then.
[09:25:12] <andrewas> ok
[09:25:15] <andrewas> anyway around it?
[09:26:18] <BillCriswell> andrewas: You'd have to run the date picker init again on the element after the page is reload, or you can maybe add the datepicker to the element on click kinda dirty like?
[09:27:23] <andrewas> hmmm ok let me give it a shot
[09:27:25] <BillCriswell> andrewas: http://jzaefferer.github.io/effective-jquery/#6 Something like this.
[09:30:10] <andrewas> BillCriswell: that works
[09:30:13] <andrewas> worked
[09:30:16] <andrewas> thanks
[09:30:22] <BillCriswell> Welcome.
[09:31:21] <co-ganteng> Hello guyz
[09:31:54] <BillCriswell> Ay.
[09:33:52] <bigson> I'm newbie in Jquery. I'm already succeed to show the grid. Anyone known how to print the grid ? Thanks u
[09:38:34] <bigson> Just gave me the clue.. what's should i use to enable printing the grid in Jquery ? Thank's u
[09:38:35] <BillCriswell> bigson: That's like 3% of a question.
[09:40:08] <bigson> Bill.. i don't know what is use to show the printing button...
[10:29:45] <rominronin> does anybody know how I can capture the contents of a browser window in jQuery/javascript (output as image)?
[10:31:24] <Cork> rominronin: you can't really do that
[10:31:45] <Cork> rominronin: it was possible with canvas in some browsers for a little white
[10:31:58] <Cork> but it was blocked cause it can leak info cross domain
[10:32:11] <rominronin> ah.
[10:32:19] <Cork> (load an iframe take a screenshot gram address from the image)
[10:32:36] <rominronin> I understand
[10:32:45] <rominronin> so that puts me in a spot
[10:32:59] <Cork> what is it your trying to do?
[10:34:27] <rominronin> well, I’m designing a one-page web app where users drag and drop objects on an image. The screen capture + email of their creation is the final part of the project
[10:34:44] <rominronin> I was hoping to code it entirely in jquery, html, css and php (for the email)
[10:35:54] <jakey> code what now?
[10:36:03] <Cork> rominronin: you could do that with a canvas
[10:36:11] <Cork> you would have to draw the image in the canvas though
[10:36:16] <rominronin> ok
[10:36:21] <Cork> then you could output it as an image and upload it
[10:36:28] <rominronin> the drag and drop part too?
[10:36:35] <Cork> optionally
[10:36:50] <rominronin> can i drag and drop things from outside the canvas onto it?
[10:37:01] <Cork> either you do the illustration in dom and then recreate it in canvas
[10:37:05] <Cork> or you do it all in canvas
[10:37:06] <rominronin> I’ve not worked with canvas before - i’ve done html5 animations
[10:37:24] <rominronin> ok.
[10:37:25] <Cork> rominronin: canvas is basically just a framebuffer
[10:37:42] <Cork> you draw in it with images, lines from to and fill colors
[10:37:50] <Cork> it isn't elements
[10:38:10] <Cork> so if you can grab offsets from the images you overlay in dom
[10:38:19] <Cork> you could just draw them on the same location in the canvas
[10:38:23] <Cork> and generate the image
[10:39:17] <rominronin> @Cork Thanks. Can I pick your brains a little in a pm?
[10:39:59] <Cork> rominronin: i prefer if it is kept in the channel
[10:40:06] <rominronin> ok.
[10:40:15] <Cork> what i give is public help after all :)
[10:40:23] <rominronin> understood
[10:40:31] <rominronin> and appreciated :)
[10:41:19] <Cork> rominronin: actually there seams to be a possible "hack" that you might be able to use https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Canvas/Drawing_DOM_objects_into_a_canvas
[10:41:33] <rominronin> where can I learn more about canvas?
[10:41:37] <Cork> though it is prob simpler to generate the canvas image if the structure isn't too complex
[10:41:56] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Canvas_tutorial
[10:42:16] <decx> what are you trying to do in canvas?
[10:42:44] <Cork> decx: he is trying to generate an image from user customizing "something"
[10:43:11] <jakey> http://camanjs.com/
[10:43:16] <decx> what like crop, mirror
[10:44:05] <jakey> http://fabricjs.com/ probably better
[10:44:06] <Cork> decx: i think it is more like designing a tshirt or something like that
[10:44:21] <rominronin> user drags and drops some predefined elements on to a div/canvas. the end goal is: an image is created from the user input and sent as an attachment in an email
[10:44:53] <decx> either way the topic is too deep for just quikcly throwing something together, so unless you want to commit a few weeks to get into it a libe like fabric will be best for you
[10:45:03] <decx> lib*
[10:46:01] <Cork> decx: if all he wants to do is rendering a few images and similer things ontop of each other
[10:46:12] <Cork> it shouldn't take a few weeks to implement
[10:46:22] <Cork> more like a few hours
[10:46:59] <Cork> it all comes down to how complex the elements to render are
[10:47:15] <decx> if you put dragging into the mix it becomes all the more complex
[10:47:27] <rominronin> I like the lookof fabricjs
[10:47:43] <Cork> decx: i think he already has the dragging done in jquery
[10:48:03] <rominronin> not yet
[10:48:04] <decx> oh well i guess i dont know enough to give an accurate time ^^
[10:48:33] <Cork> rominronin: ah, ok then ya that part you might want to find a lib for then
[10:48:48] <Cork> cause getting elements to move around the way you like can be tricky
[10:49:01] <Cork> if you pick canvas or dom doesn't really matter much
[10:49:25] <rominronin> perfect - I can create a stickman!
[10:49:40] <jakey> Yeah, you definitely don't want to debug layering and pointer events in jquery yourself
[10:49:41] <rominronin> I need optional lines connecting my objects :)
[10:49:52] <rominronin> hah
[10:50:52] <jakey> I spent about 3 months just trying to extend a charting library on canvas
[10:51:29] <rominronin> :)
[10:51:31] <Cork> jakey: charting is quite complex though
[10:51:52] <jakey> They weren't interactive ._.
[10:51:53] <rominronin> fabricjs looks like it has everything - big thanks guys/gals
[10:52:43] <Cork> jakey: hmm then it sounds a bit muxh
[10:52:46] <Cork> *much
[10:52:58] <Cork> though i prefer to have chartings done in svg
[10:53:30] <jakey> I needed canvas so I could render to PNG on the backend
[10:53:47] <Cork> ah
[10:58:45] <stoned> hey
[10:58:49] <stoned> put a cork in it!
[10:58:50] <stoned> ha.
[10:58:53] <stoned> <-
[10:59:30] <jakey> wat
[11:00:11] <BillCriswell> Cork: I think they're coming onto you.
[11:00:27] <Cork> they're?
[11:00:41] <Cork> i've only seen one yet
[11:02:36] <BillCriswell> Does that have to be plural?
[11:03:11] <BillCriswell> Would it be better to say "it's" there?
[11:04:44] <SniperH4x0r> how would i get it so that certain jquery won't run on an iphone
[11:04:51] <SniperH4x0r> but it would run on an ipad or desktop machine
[11:05:21] <SniperH4x0r> if(browser.indexOf("Mobile") > -1){
[11:05:28] <SniperH4x0r> that grabs both ipad and iphone =\
[11:05:37] <BillCriswell> SniperH4x0r: You can do it based on device size instead of that.
[11:05:50] <BillCriswell> Do you really only want it not to run on iPhone or all small devices?
[11:06:01] <rominronin> @decx A question about canvas and ie compatibility
[11:06:02] <SniperH4x0r> all small devices
[11:06:21] <decx> rominronin it's shit
[11:06:31] <rominronin> caniuse.com says canvas is not supported, but fabricjs says it is.
[11:06:41] <SniperH4x0r> BillCriswell:
[11:06:54] <rominronin> using excanvas
[11:06:59] <rominronin> hmm
[11:07:32] <decx> canvas support from ie9 i believe and terrible at that until 11 iirc
[11:07:36] <BillCriswell> SniperH4x0r: You can do like screen.width > 320 or something.
[11:08:48] <SniperH4x0r> thanks
[11:11:43] <bracky> does anyone know how I could do this? http://pastie.org/pastes/9542400/text
[11:11:52] <bracky> read the sigle-line comment at the end
[11:14:07] <Xtreme> guys anyone knows any good jquery based crawler? which also supports ajax?
[11:14:56] <rominronin> @decx thanks
[11:45:11] <jeffreylevesque> anyone here do ajax with php?
[11:45:42] <Jattenalle> jeffreylevesque, you're going to have to be more specific than that
[11:46:59] <jeffreylevesque> I know that you cannot return more than one json objects in php `print json_encode( array( ...) );`  But, i don't understand why.  I am trying to find some sort of documentation or article that explains this more
[11:47:26] <Jattenalle> uh, you can return as much as you want
[11:47:42] <jeffreylevesque> i can only print / echo one json object
[11:47:58] <Jattenalle> sounds like you're doing something wrong then
[11:48:19] <Uhkis> put some arrays in your arrays
[11:49:45] <jeffreylevesque> Jattenalle: https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/issues/155
[12:01:44] <jtocci> hey ppl. I have a jquery selector in the form: 'div.table_class > table.tble_class'. I'd like to create a function which checks to see if such a structure exists, and if not, it creates it. Is there a standard way to parse a jquery selector into an element structure? I haven't had any luck.
[12:10:50] <goosfraba> hi, i'm trying to fetch data from a url. the data returns as objects, how can i convert it to plain text/strings and place it in my #container tag? this is my code so far: http://pastebin.com/bSsVAVxM
[12:11:18] <goosfraba> im getting the data but on my webpage it just says [object Object]
[12:37:26] <Xtreme> figured out its a jquery question... so "Guys, please take a look at http://apaste.info/gG4. elem[i] is there in done. When i run inArray in console, it gives me position 2. but here it gives -1 all the time" What can be the reason?
[12:42:44] <BillCriswell> Xtreme: We have no idea what done is.
[12:43:50] <BillCriswell> Also, you have an if: if($.inArray(elem[i], done) === -1 surrounding where you do console.log("Checker "+ $.inArray(elem[i], done));
[12:44:00] <BillCriswell> so of course it's only going to give you -1.
[12:47:03] <no_gravity> In a blur handler, is there an easy way to find out why the blur happened? for example, which other element was clicked?
[12:48:33] <Xtreme> BillCriswell, i solved it :) But can you tell me one thing?
[12:48:43] <Xtreme> say i have two div. div a and b
[12:48:53] <Xtreme> a has no click event, but b has a click event.
[12:49:00] <Xtreme> so how can i check which div has click event?
[12:50:12] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Might be able to check document.activeElement after the blur happen.
[12:50:29] <BillCriswell> Xtreme: Are a and b nested?
[12:50:39] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: tried that. its always body.
[12:50:49] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Mobile?
[12:51:10] <BillCriswell> That was happening to me yesterday on mobile. It was driving me nuts.
[12:51:54] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: no, firefox on linux. i need it to work across all browsers though.
[12:52:13] <Xtreme> BillCriswell, nope.. seperate div
[12:52:17] <Xtreme> can be nested..
[12:52:32] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Hm, found kind of a dirty way around it: http://jsbin.com/lixedajiqoqo/1/edit?html,js,output
[12:53:06] <BillCriswell> Might want to up it to like 10 since I have no idea what that delay might actually be?
[12:53:48] <no_gravity> looks like the element is in originalEvent.explicitOriginalTarget
[12:54:14] <BillCriswell> Xtreme: If a and b are separate and there's only a click event on a then that's the only event you can tell that was clicked.
[12:54:18] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: your delay solution works here, but i would hesitate to use it.
[12:54:24] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Agreed.
[12:55:32] <BillCriswell> I hate how often a timeout like that makes things work haha
[12:56:51] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: It looks like event.currentTarget will give it to you as well?
[12:57:53] <BillCriswell> Wait that's not right haha.
[12:59:35] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/nuzocadosuri/1/edit
[12:59:44] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: does this work for you?
[13:00:01] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: undefined.
[13:00:13] <Xtreme> BillCriswell, :) but i want to know if there is a click event or not..
[13:00:43] <BillCriswell> You can't know there was a click event on an element unless you have an event listener on it or one of its parents.
[13:00:54] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: damn. it works in firefox.
[13:01:46] <BillCriswell> Can you do the logic on focus instead and just keep track of the last blurred element?
[13:02:08] <Xtreme> BillCriswell, please explain little bit... Eg, say if i attach a listener to a parent. then how can i come to know?
[13:02:16] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: how would you tell the browser to call your "focus whatever" event?
[13:03:47] <BillCriswell> Xtreme: You're looking for the event.target I think. <div class="parent"><div class="child">Child</div></div> Then you can do $('.parent').on('click', function (event) { /* event.target here would be .child or .parent depending on which was clicked */ });
[13:03:55] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Like .trigger() ?
[13:04:55] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: on what?
[13:05:18] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Not sure I'm following sorry haha
[13:09:33] <bracky> can anyonf find a solution for this? http://pastie.org/pastes/9543007/text
[13:09:38] <bracky> i've been trying for a while
[13:09:43] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Looks like event.relatedTarget might be enough?
[13:10:20] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: http://jsbin.com/lixedajiqoqo/2/edit?html,js,output yup that's it.
[13:16:13] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: gives me HTMLInputElement even when i click on the body
[13:16:23] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: i resorted to the timeout solution now.
[13:16:37] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Sounds weird.
[13:17:31] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: stackoverflow has a ton of threads about it: https://www.google.de/search?q=blur+event+which+element+got+focus
[13:20:30] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: http://jsbin.com/lixedajiqoqo/2/edit?html,js,output does this work?
[13:20:56] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: no
[13:22:02] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: http://jsbin.com/lixedajiqoqo/2/edit?css,js,output what about with focusout instead?
[13:22:19] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: does it work in your browser?
[13:22:31] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Yes. Btoh do in Chrome.
[13:22:39] <BillCriswell> Let me open firefo.
[13:23:47] <BillCriswell> Hm, no lock with firefox.
[13:23:48] <BillCriswell> luck*
[13:23:49] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: here, it doesn't work in chromium
[13:24:02] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: gives me input when i click on the body
[13:27:00] <BillCriswell> That's annoying.
[13:27:33] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: your timeout solution seems to work pretty stable.
[13:27:45] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: That's good then.
[13:27:56] <BillCriswell> I just get annoyed by things like this haha
[13:28:16] <no_gravity> in ff+chromium. will test some more browsers now.
[13:30:30] <no_gravity> safari on ipad is fine too.
[13:30:53] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Sweet.
[13:32:09] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: ie11 does not like it :(
[13:33:25] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Can you give it some extra time maybe?
[13:33:28] <BillCriswell> Like, 10
[13:36:58] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: im using 10 :) will try 100 now...
[13:37:53] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Is there tabindexes on the element? If not, you might be able to do like var $inputs = $(':input'); then on blur grab $inputs.eq($inputs.index(this) + 1); ?
[13:38:49] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: http://jsbin.com/lixedajiqoqo/3/edit?html,js,output
[13:39:22] <BillCriswell> I think tab would follow the natural DOM order if there's no tabindexes?
[13:40:14] <BillCriswell> I think we've explored EVERY option.
[13:42:51] <morenoh152> anyone know of a responsive carousel? meaning it displays 3 items on desktop/tablet but only 1 item on phones
[13:43:03] <morenoh152> don't think the bootstrap one cuts it
[13:46:16] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: i had to up the timeout to 200ms to work in ie. using that for now...
[13:47:24] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Ah nice. If you get caught up again I think the .index() option isn't terrible.
[13:51:00] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: that does not give me the element that got the focus.
[13:51:30] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: You sure about that?
[13:51:47] <BillCriswell> When I blur name I get age, etc, etc
[13:51:48] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: yeah. it says "hobbies" when i click on the body and stuff like that.
[13:52:39] <no_gravity> BillCriswell: a solution for the 200ms problem might be this: call a function in 1ms, check if the active element is still the same.. if so, wait 10ms.. check again.. if active element did not change wait 100ms ... etc.
[13:52:52] <BillCriswell> no_gravity: Good times.
[13:53:59] <morenoh152> http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/ found it
[13:57:51] <bracky> does anyone know why this isn't working? http://jsfiddle.net/Lmzrvvoy/3/
[14:07:28] <no_gravity> bracky: whats that?
[14:08:08] <bracky> no_gravity: it's supposed to give me the b64 representation of an image, but nevermind
[14:48:33] <jeffreylevesque> could someone explain to me why more than one `print json_encode(array( .. ))` results in a failed ajax
[14:48:46] <jeffreylevesque> the latter is in php
[14:49:16] <jeffreylevesque> am i creating more than one json object for my jquery ajax script?
[14:49:27] <jeffreylevesque> why can't jquery accept more than one json object?
[14:49:51] <jeffreylevesque> i know you can nest everything within just one json_encode, but why can't i do them separately
[14:53:02] <jaake> I am trying to figure out how to run an auto submit // $('target').submit() when someone has populated a file upload from // $('upload_form').on('change', submit_func());
[14:53:19] <jaake> but it always just fires on DOM load then never again
[14:53:42] <jaake> I can enter $('target').submit() in the console and it works fine
[14:53:47] <jaake> what am I doing wrong?
[14:55:10] <jeffreylevesque> jaake, 'submit' should be a behavior defined within the form.  No need to add event listeners to it
[15:00:16] <jaake> jeffreylevesque: I want it to submit automatically after there is any input
[15:00:57] <jaake> in the form this call jquery_ujs ajax to upload the file
[15:01:26] <jeffreylevesque> you could us the jquery 'on()' method
[15:01:28] <jaake> works fine manually, I just want to eliminate the extra button press
[15:02:19] <jeffreylevesque> $('form').on('input change', 'selector-for-input', callbackFunction());
[15:02:32] <jeffreylevesque> jaake^^
[15:02:52] <jaake> I tried: $('file_form').on('change', function() { $('button').submit() }
[15:02:54] <jeffreylevesque> i think you could just use 'change'
[15:03:19] <jaake> what is the selector-for-input?
[15:03:42] <jeffreylevesque> that specifies where the event is triggered on
[15:03:56] <jaake> ahh would that be .val
[15:03:58] <jaake> ?
[15:04:13] <jaake> $('file_form').val()
[15:04:20] <jaake> or value?
[15:04:24] <SMZ> Hi from NY.
[15:04:29] <jaake> hello
[15:04:56] <jeffreylevesque> the on() attaches one event listener to the entire parent, in your case 'file_form', then it only fires to specific elements within the parent.  That is 'selector-for-input'
[15:05:02] <SMZ> Anyone know why jQuery UI, and jQuery code in HTML5 documents is being blocked by LibreJS?
[15:05:55] <jaake> hmm, I tried your code and it's still just firing on DOM load
[15:06:10] <jeffreylevesque> you could use ajax, if you want to learn it
[15:06:48] <jeffreylevesque> jaake: if you want to learn ajax - https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/html_form_ajax.js
[15:06:59] <jaake> I feel like any of these should work, I would like to know more about what 'change' is actually looking for
[15:07:15] <jeffreylevesque> change works with file uploads
[15:07:16] <jaake> ajax has better event listenerS?
[15:07:19] <jeffreylevesque> i have that working with  my form
[15:07:38] <jeffreylevesque> input, is kind of like keypress
[15:08:06] <jeffreylevesque> input, doesn't work with file upload, though.  so, change is good
[15:08:25] <jaake> kk,
[15:08:46] <jaake> and I am targeting the parent div of the input block right?
[15:08:51] <jeffreylevesque> ajax, basically lets you send stuff to your server (i.e.) php without reloading the page.  It also, allows your php to send to your javascript, without reloading the page
[15:09:06] <jaake> jeffreylevesque: yeah, everything on this project is working with ajax
[15:09:17] <jaake> you just have to press the button
[15:09:23] <jaake> I don't want to press the button
[15:10:08] <jaake> I'm using ajax to grab the user location and then fill the page with related content
[15:10:11] <jaake> all that works fine
[15:10:57] <jeffreylevesque> jaake, the answer from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16245248/submit-automatically-a-form-with-jquery-onchange-event
[15:11:05] <jeffreylevesque> it didn't get any downvot
[15:11:08] <jeffreylevesque> *downvote
[15:11:55] <jeffreylevesque> jaake: sorry. take a look at https://github.com/jeff1evesque/machine-learning/blob/master/src/js/html_form_ajax.js#L53
[15:12:40] <jeffreylevesque> the latter if you want to use ajax.  Otherwise, the former if all jquery w/o ajax
[15:15:42] <jaake> kk ty
[15:27:41] <nCrazed> is there a simple way to turn <a> links to issue ajax requests instead?
[15:28:24] <jaake> jeffreylevesque: I fixed it with an if condition inside setInterval
[15:28:37] <jaake> weird that the listener wasn't working right though
[15:28:42] <nCrazed> ie use make a get request to the href destination so that I only need to implement the callback
[15:28:51] <nCrazed> -use
[15:29:32] <jeffreylevesque> jaake, thats excellent!
[15:40:29] <znf> wow, the docs on $.ajax are really long and confusing and filled with legacy stuff
[15:40:37] <znf> hard to simply skim trough like the rest of the docs
[15:47:24] <robertmaxrees> decx see i'm alive.
[15:52:12] <decx> i'll make a mark in my diary: duch_kazatel not dead
[15:53:48] <robertmaxrees> fantastic.
[15:54:45] <decx> you missed out on some great banter in frontend regarding apples presentation
[15:54:59] <robertmaxrees> lol get it?  because it was a trainwreck
[16:20:39] <znf> Can someone help me understand why this won't work? http://jsfiddle.net/9z66fycr/
[16:20:50] <znf> setting the data-bool value to "no"
[16:21:43] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle.net/9z66fycr/1/
[16:21:45] <robertmaxrees> works fine.
[16:21:55] <robertmaxrees> .data() doesn't change the markup.
[16:22:04] <robertmaxrees> it updates a cached version of the markup.
[16:22:13] <znf> Oh.
[16:22:16] <robertmaxrees> *cached version of the data attributes, I mean.
[16:22:17] <znf> Crap.
[16:22:20] <robertmaxrees> which makes it faster.
[16:22:36] <znf> Then I need to rethink this, because it's not working correctly for me :-/
[16:22:42] <robertmaxrees> what's the issue?
[16:23:57] <znf> robertmaxrees, http://c.n-zone.ro/ can't toggle the red/green buttons more than once, it seems
[16:24:27] <robertmaxrees> what's up with the console errors?
[16:24:39] <znf> just debug purposes
[16:24:59] <robertmaxrees> the errors look like legit errors.
[16:25:21] <robertmaxrees> wait are you selecting on data attributes?
[16:25:25] <znf> yes
[16:25:32] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[16:25:34] <robertmaxrees> select on classes.
[16:25:54] <robertmaxrees> data attributes are slow for selecting.  classes are good for that kind of stuff.
[16:26:22] <znf> wait, I think I misunderstood your question
[16:26:24] <znf> what do you mean?
[16:26:55] <robertmaxrees> are you doing stuff like $('[data-bool="true"]') ?
[16:27:07] <robertmaxrees> selecting on the data attributes?
[16:27:10] <znf> oh, no
[16:27:14] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[16:27:35] <robertmaxrees> i gotta go.  sorry.  good luck!
[16:27:39] <znf> see the script at the bottom
[16:27:40] <znf> oh
[16:27:41] <znf> :-/

[19:08:44] <tester_> hi guys i'm trying to get the data passed with event by e.data.something but its returns null, but  e.object.somethings returns with the value. is it normal or i'm doing something wrong
[19:09:27] <BillCriswell> tester_: How are you passing the data with event?
[19:10:37] <sanman__> hey, how can I check the state of a checkbox with jquery?
[19:13:14] <tester_> BillCriswell, i am not passing the data to an event actually. its like here http://jsfiddle.net/n1ksqccx/
[19:14:00] <BillCriswell> sanman__: You can do .prop('checked') and that'll give you a bool.
[19:16:13] <BillCriswell> tester_: This appears to be working unless I'm misunderstanding something.
[19:17:08] <tester_> BillCriswell, i got what it's wrong with my code. you see there's a data object bto
[19:18:29] <tester_>  BillCriswell, i got what it's wrong with my code. you see there's a data object binded to a click event. if you pass something else from object named data, it doesn't work.
[19:19:11] <BillCriswell> tester_: I'm sorry I'm really confused now haha.
[19:19:37] <BillCriswell> tester_: Does this help? http://jsfiddle.net/n1ksqccx/2/
[19:21:42] <tester_>  BillCriswell, nevermind. i got what is wrong with my code. sorry i can't explain myself cause english is not my native language. thank you anyway.
[19:22:16] <BillCriswell> tester_: No problem! Glad you got it worked out.
[19:27:57] <sanman__> how do I prepend a checkbox inside a div?
[19:28:23] <BillCriswell> sanman__: $('.some-div').prepend('<input type="checkbox">')
[19:28:27] <sanman__> I'm using a line that looks like this:
[19:28:29] <sanman__> $buttons.each(function(i,button){$(this).prepend("<input type='checkbox'/>").attr('id',this.attr('alt'));});
[19:28:34] <BillCriswell> sanman__: http://api.jquery.com/prepend/
[19:29:06] <BillCriswell> sanman__: Is $buttons actually a bunch of divs?
[19:29:11] <sanman__> yeah
[19:29:23] <sanman__> var $buttons = $(this).find(".hotbutton");
[19:29:42] <sanman__> the buttons are all divs with class ".hotbutton"
[19:29:51] <sanman__> oops "hotbutton"
[19:30:22] <BillCriswell> Ok, you're close.
[19:30:30] <sanman__> I want the id of the checkbox to be the alt text of the div
[19:31:15] <sanman__> hmm
[19:31:22] <sanman__> but no checkboxes are appearing at all
[19:32:19] <BillCriswell> The div having alt text is kind of weird, but you want to do this: $(button).prepend($('<input/>').attr({type: 'checkbox', id: button.alt }));
[19:33:48] <sanman__> still don't see any checkboxes :/
[19:33:55] <sanman__> hmm
[19:34:41] <BillCriswell> sanman__: http://jsbin.com/wicurapijofu/1/edit?html,js,output
[19:34:42] <sanman__> oops, now I see them
[19:34:52] <sanman__> they're all stretched out inside my divs
[19:34:57] <sanman__> distorted
[19:35:25] <BillCriswell> sanman__: CSS issue.
[19:35:30] <sanman__> hmm
[19:35:37] <BillCriswell> Probably have input width: 100% or something of that nature.
[19:35:52] <sanman__> any way to prepend in front  of an element - just before it - instead of inside of it?
[19:37:02] <BillCriswell> sanman__: http://api.jquery.com/before/
[19:57:12] <callista> hi, i want to ask this: suppose we set $('#elem1').data('test','some-value-here'); and then we delete $('#elem1').remove(); does the data('test') persists or it is deleted as well?
[19:57:57] <jphase> callista: data attributes are just that, attributes. when you delete an element, the element's attributes are deleted as well
[19:58:31] <jphase> it'd be similar to trying to access the style attribute of an HTML tag that isn't on the page
[19:59:14] <callista> jphase oh ok, just to make sure, because im afraid it will persists
[19:59:45] <jphase> nope, just literally adds data-test="some-value-here" to an element with id="elem1"
[19:59:48] <jphase> ;)
[20:00:00] <callista> because .data('something') is not set in DOM, rite?
[20:01:26] <callista> thats $('#elem1').attr('data-test') ? if i read it correctly, jquery stores .data() internally in its own cache?
[20:03:52] <jphase> callista: no cache or anything
[20:04:34] <jphase> $('#elem1').data('test', 'something');  <---  this literally just changes <div id="elem1"></div> to <div id="elem1" data-test="something"></div>
[20:04:54] <jphase> so when you remove the elem1 div, all the attributes in that div are removed as well
[20:06:00] <callista> i tried that in console, it doesnt add the data-test into the element?
[20:07:28] <callista> this is what i do: $('#elem1').data('cache','test me')
[20:08:04] <callista> when i check inside the div, there is no data-cache attribute
[20:08:26] <jphase> are you looking in "view source" or by "inspecting the element"?
[20:08:35] <callista> inspecting element
[20:08:49] <jphase> then your elem1 isn't the right id
[20:08:52] <jphase> or you don't have jQuery loaded
[20:08:58] <jphase> or something more remedial
[20:09:08] <callista> im using chrome
[20:09:20] <callista> i have jquery loaded
[20:09:41] <jphase> this happen to be on a wordpress site?
[20:09:42] <callista> when i use .attr('data-cache','something')
[20:09:57] <callista> LOL no
[20:10:11] <callista> when i use .attr('data-cache','something'), the data-cache exists
[20:10:42] <callista> but when i use the .data('cache', 'something) to set the data, it wont exists in element
[20:10:55] <callista> and i read in docs, that is the case
[20:11:25] <callista> so im curious whether if i deleted the element, the data stored is deleted as well or not, since there is no way i can check it
[20:12:08] <jphase> the data is deleted as well
[20:12:39] <jphase> you can either set it in HTML as a data attribute, or if you do it on the fly, you'll see it add to the element in inspect or if done in console, it's attached to the DOM element
[20:12:50] <jphase> read the description:  http://api.jquery.com/jquery.data/
[20:12:58] <jphase> or, the "Note:" rather
[20:13:39] <callista> i think its http://api.jquery.com/data/ ?
[20:14:30] <jphase> they're synonymous callista
[20:16:58] <callista> jphase u can see it in http://api.jquery.com/data/ at the last example
[20:17:12] <callista> if u inspect the element
[20:17:51] <callista> the div doesnt have data-blah attribute, then when we set it to 'hello' it doesnt show in the element
[20:18:15] <jphase> sure, when the page is loaded, it's not stored directly in the attribute
[20:18:28] <jphase> read the docs on .data (either link since they're the same method)
[20:19:08] <jphase> you can retrieve data-blah="something" with .data('blah'), or you can set it with .data('blah', 'something') but that doesn't mean it will appear when inspecting
[20:19:18] <jphase> the DOM data is stored (and removed) with the DOM object
[20:19:22] <jphase> as described in their docs
[20:20:45] <callista> yes thank you ^_^ im just curious to know whether the .data stored is deleted as well when the dom element is deleted, or we have to use .removeData() first
[20:21:23] <thabersack> Hello! I hope someone can take a quick look; this is a simple .click() vs .on() thing I'm sure. I can't get a section of js to fire when a generated button is clicked. Click on 'click here', then click the generated button. http://jsfiddle.net/94hwqeLf/
[20:22:15] <jphase> callista: again........... as clearly described in their docs:  " jQuery ensures that the data is removed when DOM elements are removed via jQuery methods, and when the user leaves the page."  ....... yes
[20:23:14] <jphase> thabersack: you need to use delegation for that
[20:23:31] <jphase> bind the event to the parent and pass a child selector, for example, or bind the event to the element before you create it
[20:26:05] <callista> yes thank you jphase ^_^
[20:26:48] <jphase> thabersack: i.e. http://jsfiddle.net/94hwqeLf/1/
[20:27:24] <jphase> it's better to bind to a more direct parent than "body" though fyi, but for the sake of your fiddle :\
[20:28:41] <thabersack> jphase: Thank you so much! Gosh, I feel dumb.
[20:30:30] <jphase> no need to feel dumb, there's a few different ways to do it. some people prefer to bind the event to the element as its created instead
[20:31:16] <callista> going to do my homework~
[20:31:21] <callista> see you guys later ^_^
[20:31:27] <jphase> ciao :)
[20:31:40] <callista> thx jphase~
[20:35:43] <thabersack> Well I appreciate you taking the time to alter the fiddle for me; really helped jphase
[20:36:16] <jphase> np

[23:17:35] <Axane> Hello got one question my jquery is loading incomplete from web server sometiems it load complete sometimes not and it have like spaces in it so it ends early with incomplete code
[23:17:39] <Axane> What could be causing this?
[23:19:15] <blackkbot> your server
[23:19:25] <blackkbot> you need to use the cdn
[23:20:48] <Axane> blackkbot hmm but thath only happens to few of the users not majority or something
[23:45:01] <Cork> Axane: make sure you don't have invalid characters in the file
[23:45:17] <Cork> that could possibly cause the connection to be closed prematurely
[23:45:47] <Axane> Cork its clear file from jquery site seems is trouble with python somewhere as others script doesnt load completly too.
[23:46:48] <Cork> Axane: make sure the Content-Length contains the correct value
[23:47:00] <Cork> that could possibly be another reason
