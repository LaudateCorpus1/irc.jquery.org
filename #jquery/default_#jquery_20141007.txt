[00:12:24] <whostolemytrain> Hello everyone! What am i doing wrong here? XD
[00:12:25] <whostolemytrain> <script>     $( document ).ready(          function ()         {             $( '#valuegen').click(function()             {                 $( ".test ").append( $( "<p>Test</p>" ) );             });         }      ); </script>
[00:12:37] <whostolemytrain> http://pastebin.com/7AdH7hKZ
[00:12:38] <whostolemytrain> sorry
[00:12:44] <Uhkis> ?paste @ whostolemytrain
[00:12:44] <b-ot> whostolemytrain: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[00:13:51] <whostolemytrain> http://jsfiddle.net/j81qgqbb/
[00:14:08] <whostolemytrain> Has some PHP in it but you should get the idea
[00:14:26] <whostolemytrain> It's not giving me the <p> when i click on valuegen
[00:14:48] <Stummi> whostolemytrain, you don't have an object valuegen
[00:14:52] <Stummi> *with id
[00:15:07] <whostolemytrain> It's the php generated information
[00:15:13] <whostolemytrain> i passed in an id
[00:15:13] <Woet> whostolemytrain: the point of jsfiddle is to have a working demo..
[00:15:27] <whostolemytrain> Yes but how is that possible when my code runs with php?
[00:15:37] <Woet> copy / paste the HTML it generates?
[00:15:41] <Woet> it's not rocket science
[00:16:09] <Woet> anyways, you are assigning the ID "valuegen" to all of your options
[00:16:13] <Woet> what are you trying to do?
[00:16:36] <Nostalg14c> Can someone help me with this; http://jsfiddle.net/gs1hpvv9/5/ - i want it to onyl show the appropriate div's (eg. click Custom checkbox it will only show the two with Custom in them)
[00:18:04] <Woet> Nostalg14c: and what is the problem?
[00:18:18] <Nostalg14c> AT the moment it shows/hides all of the dvis
[00:18:25] <Nostalg14c> divs*, instead of the individual ones;.
[00:18:29] <Woet> indeed, because all of the divs have the 3 classes.
[00:18:45] <Nostalg14c> fml.
[00:19:14] <Nostalg14c> I had it right haha, forgot to alter them
[00:23:34] <zeroquake> when do u  use native selectors vs jquery selectors?
[00:24:29] <whostolemytrain> Something was wrong with the JS code. There was a missing ). But hey, it aint rocket sience. Thanks for the help.
[00:25:08] <ruby_on_tails> in a multiline paragprah i want to replace the line breaks with some character how can i do that?
[00:29:25] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: simplest is prob to serialize and .replace the string
[00:29:42] <ruby_on_tails> hmm
[00:29:56] <Cork> ruby_on_tails: you could try something like $().replaceWith(document.createTextNode('replacement text'))
[00:30:04] <Cork> but not sure that works
[00:33:44] <Nostalg14c> Aaand i'm back. I need this to hide/show the entire div instead of just the 'listing-details' part - http://jsfiddle.net/gs1hpvv9/19/
[00:34:16] <Nostalg14c> so hide the 'wpbdp-listing' class instead of the 'listing-details' class.
[00:35:57] <zeroquake> anyone know any interesting not so obvious ways of checking if a value exists in an array?
[00:37:00] <funhouse> Hi, just wondering what html5 library is the best to use for a simple card game? Or should I just use jquery and an animation libary like greensock?
[00:48:06] <tirengarfio> Im changing the value of an input using  buttons Up and Down. Of course, I can also change the value of the input directly writing on it. Is there any way to detect the change of value in both cases?
[00:51:12] <Cork> tirengarfio: i'm quite sure the input event should work
[00:51:45] <Cork> tirengarfio: or do you mean you change it with js?
[00:52:02] <tirengarfio> yes, I change ti with js
[00:52:10] <Cork> then no
[00:52:17] <Cork> js changes doesn't trigger events
[00:52:30] <Cork> you would end up in infinite loops if they did :)
[00:52:56] <Cork> you can fire a fake event after you've changed the value though
[00:53:19] <Cork> .trigger('event-name-you-want-to-trigger')
[00:55:16] <Nostalg14c> Can someone please help me with this - http://jsfiddle.net/gs1hpvv9/32/ - I want to hide the wpbdp-listing class instead of the listing-details class.
[00:56:26] <Cork> Nostalg14c: uh, not sure what the problem is
[00:57:21] <Nostalg14c> Cork: At the moment it hides listing-details class, which for this example is the only part where there is details. But I want to hide it by the wpbdp-listing class instead.
[00:57:40] <Cork> Nostalg14c: no you don't
[00:57:53] <Cork> you hide the div inside the details class
[00:58:24] <Nostalg14c> Not sure what you mean - here is a better example. http://jsfiddle.net/gs1hpvv9/33/
[00:58:43] <Cork> Nostalg14c: $(".listing-details > div").hide(); <--
[00:58:55] <Cork> you find the div that is a direct child of .listing-details
[00:59:01] <Cork> you don't touch listing-details
[00:59:41] <Nostalg14c> Okay, how do i hide the 2nd parent insted?
[00:59:57] <Cork> you don't hide the parent
[01:00:01] <Cork> that is my point
[01:00:07] <Nostalg14c> But I want to, which is my point.
[01:00:23] <Cork> well you would have to find the div you are currently hiding
[01:00:30] <Nostalg14c> The example here: http://jsfiddle.net/gs1hpvv9/33/
[01:00:31] <Cork> and then traverse back up the dom tree
[01:00:37] <Nostalg14c> I want to hide the 'stuff here' parts.
[01:00:40] <Cork> or move the classes up to the parent
[01:00:51] <Cork> as css can't select parents based on children
[01:01:30] <Nostalg14c> So based on that example, how can I see what div its hiding?
[01:02:03] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/gs1hpvv9/34/
[01:02:25] <Cork> Nostalg14c: sounds like you need to read up on css selectors
[01:05:06] <Nostalg14c> Thanks Cork; I'm a sys admin not a developer unfortunately.
[01:05:56] <Cork> Nostalg14c: then you should ask someone how knows what the code does look at it
[01:06:16] <Cork> Nostalg14c: copy pasting code is a sure way to introduce bugs
[01:06:29] <Erwat> it's called job insurance
[01:07:14] <Nostalg14c> Cork: Do you mind if i PM you?
[01:07:29] <Cork> Nostalg14c: about what
[01:08:09] <Nostalg14c> Cork: The same thing. Works great in that jsfiddle, however using the code on my actual website doesn't produce the same result.
[01:09:07] <Cork> Nostalg14c: cause i didn't just change the code
[01:09:14] <Cork> i changed the html too
[01:10:57] <Nostalg14c> Cork: Ah, well.. not sure if that's really a solutoin then.
[01:11:41] <Cork> Nostalg14c: well if you don't then you need to write really hacky js to reverse select up from the element with the info you want
[01:17:03] <Nostalg14c> Cork: Unfortunately that line is generated earlier so I can't add those classes to it.
[01:17:18] <Nostalg14c> So hacky js method is needed.
[01:22:45] <anli_> Is there a javascript event for navigating away from a page, but not postbacking to the page?
[01:22:58] <anli_> I need to clear some jquery ui tabs related cookies
[01:24:44] <phx> what's the difference between .bind and .on?
[01:37:49] <anli_> How can I clear all session cookies with jquery ui?
[01:37:54] <mgpl> phx: 'bind' is basically 'on' http://james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=2.0.3&fn=jQuery.fn.bind / maybe some little performance issues
[01:38:00] <anli_> eh, forget the ui part
[01:43:20] <Cork> anli_: the same way to clear any cookie
[01:43:37] <anli_> I never clear them :)
[01:44:00] <Cork> anli_: only difference between a session cookie and a "normal" one is that it doesn't have an expiration time
[01:44:08] <Cork> anli_: document.cookies
[01:44:12] <anli_> I have to loop through the document.cookie array and filter it, it seems
[01:44:21] <Cork> it isn't an array
[01:44:24] <Cork> it is a string
[01:44:32] <anli_> Ah, true, have to split it and then build it again then
[01:44:39] <Cork> yes
[01:44:55] <Cork> welcome to 1995!
[01:44:59] <anli_> :)
[01:46:04] <t4nk094> Is it possible to somehow take .val from Jquery and look trough a mysql databse with that it?? For instance, SELECT parent FROM categories WHERE .val == id
[01:46:41] <Cork> t4nk094: jquery is client side
[01:46:45] <Cork> mysql is server side
[01:46:58] <Cork> you would have to send the data from client to the server to run a query
[01:47:09] <t4nk094> Using Ajax?
[01:47:15] <Cork> for example
[01:47:24] <Cork> remember to NOT SEND SQL QUERIES though!
[01:47:46] <Cork> and make sure to escape the data you get from the http connection
[01:48:15] <t4nk094> Yeah ofcourse :P
[01:48:25] <t4nk094> Is there any tutorial that you could recommend?
[01:48:38] <t4nk094> This is kinda unclear for me, i'm trying to do something with my select
[01:49:00] <phx> t4nk094, read a bit up on REST interfaces, that'll give you an idea how this stuff works
[01:49:23] <phx> t4h, think of the database as the storage, the web applocation as the user interface, and the web server as the middleware interfacing the DB and the UI
[01:49:27] <phx> t4nk094,
[01:50:46] <t4nk094> Yes, i have that image in front of me. All i'm lacking is the tools to actually do something with it
[01:51:12] <t4nk094> So from all this i understand that i'll need to use Ajax, i'll find a tut on that i guess
[01:52:10] <phx> it's not that hard. you need to do something like a GET /my/data?id=$id (where $id is what you get from your select, that you want to look up in the DB) and handle that on the server side, do the mysql query, then returned the results in the desired format, in JSON
[01:52:42] <phx> ir GET /my/data/$id in case of REST :)
[02:00:57] <berarma> I'm making cors ajax calls and it works but when the server answers with status code 500 it seems the scripts stop execution. I'm using chromium 37. I think this shouldn't happen, right?
[02:02:56] <anli_> I tried to set document.cookie to an empty string, did not seem to clear cookies...
[02:04:05] <anli_> Ah, have to set the date to the past
[02:04:50] <Cork> berarma: have you bound an error/fail handler?
[02:11:33] <berarma> Cork, it seems that was the problem, the bind is wrong, thank you :)
[02:11:47] <Cork> np
[02:21:11] <anli_> Seems like I cannot clear session cookies
[02:22:12] <anli_> Trying document.cookie = "news_letter_inner_tabs=; expires=Thu, 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 GMT";
[02:23:26] <anli_> Maybe I have to add path
[02:24:13] <tiasang_trongde> hello every one
[02:24:24] <anli_> Adding path=/ made a difference
[02:24:28] <anli_> Hello tiasang_trongde

[02:24:49] <tiasang_trongde> i have problem with function jquery, about clone selectbox doesn't working

[02:26:26] <Woet> tiasang_trongde: are you under the impression you gave us useful information to help you?
[02:27:14] <anli_> :)
[02:30:18] <Woet> tiasang_trongde: no, that's not the same as "please send me a private message"

[03:04:23] <Woet> mar2u: why do you use letters for variables? why is the code incomplete? what is the actual problem?
[03:05:16] <mar2u> http://jsfiddle.net/gwfntqot/
[03:05:21] <mar2u> tat is the function
[03:05:35] <mar2u> create a menu from one array
[03:05:42] <Woet> can you please just turn it into a working demo
[03:05:52] <Woet> with only code that demonstrates your problems
[03:06:10] <mar2u> when i try to add event nothing happend
[03:06:21] <mar2u> when mouse is in function drowSubMenu don't start
[03:06:51] <mar2u> problem is there: $(c).mouseenter(function(){ drowSubMenu(i) });

[03:11:23] <Woet> like I asked 5 minutes ago
[03:12:18] <paulvd> nothing i am doing wrong
[03:12:30] <Woet> paulvd: that's a very bad approach.
[03:12:39] <mar2u> ok
[03:12:47] <paulvd> whats a very bad approach ?
[03:12:59] <Woet> saying "nothing i am doing wrong".
[03:14:15] <paulvd> http://pastebin.com/iRnP9jsf
[03:14:20] <paulvd> whats wrong?
[03:14:36] <paulvd> i added .bx-wrapper also just to make sure
[03:14:53] <Woet> please provide a working demo on www.jsfiddle.net
[03:15:06] <paulvd> um
[03:15:11] <paulvd> i can give a link to the live site
[03:15:44] <Woet> okay.
[03:16:30] <paulvd> actually leave it
[03:16:37] <paulvd> i will do it another way i guess
[03:16:43] <Woet> why?
[03:17:05] <paulvd> what why
[03:17:14] <Woet> why do it another way?
[03:18:02] <paulvd> cannot rely on help like "thats a bad approach"
[03:18:11] <Woet> i told you what to do
[03:18:13] <Woet> provide a working demo
[03:18:35] <Woet> instead of claiming you're doing nothing wrong, somehow implying it's a bug in jquery
[03:18:38] <paulvd> its fine forget it
[03:18:44] <paulvd> well i showed you the code
[03:19:50] <paulvd> was nothing wrong in the code
[03:19:53] <paulvd> afaik
[03:20:24] <mgpl> ...
[03:20:31] <Woet> indeed, which works fine: http://jsfiddle.net/5L3cqxL0/
[03:21:27] <Woet> which is why you need to provide a working demo, which includes the HTML, so I can see where the actual problem lies
[03:23:17] <mar2u> http://jsfiddle.net/gwfntqot/
[03:23:44] <Woet> mar2u: how many times do I need to ask to provide a working demo?
[03:24:58] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/jx0h7fg4/ why i always get NaN as result ?
[03:25:10] <xnotte> all fields have numbers
[03:25:44] <Woet> xnotte: please provide a working demo..
[03:26:04] <mar2u> http://jsfiddle.net/gwfntqot/1/
[03:26:13] <mar2u> that work :D
[03:26:19] <mar2u> or must work
[03:26:35] <decx> xnotte you return from a function not loose
[03:26:36] <Woet> mar2u: check the console.
[03:27:17] <xnotte> decx yes, where is return result should be console.log(result) it returns NaN
[03:28:43] <decx> there is no value in those inputs anyway
[03:29:06] <Woet> xnotte: parseInt on 'undefined' is NaN.
[03:29:23] <Woet> check if the field exists, then add it to result.
[03:29:35] <decx> or do .val() || 0
[03:29:37] <xnotte> Woet: http://jsfiddle.net/jx0h7fg4/2/
[03:29:50] <xnotte> they exist
[03:29:55] <Woet> they don't.
[03:29:58] <Woet> fee0 does not exist
[03:30:06] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/jx0h7fg4/3/
[03:30:08] <Woet> fee5, 6, etc do not exist either.
[03:30:16] <Woet> same thing
[03:30:19] <Woet> fee0 does not exist.
[03:30:21] <xnotte> stupid, it was fee0
[03:30:36] <Woet> not sure why you are using a for loop in the first place
[03:30:41] <Woet> just use $("input").each
[03:30:47] <xnotte> Woet: ok thanks
[03:30:47] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/jx0h7fg4/4/
[03:31:00] <xnotte> not enough sleep
[03:31:30] <mar2u> ok
[03:31:34] <xnotte> thanks guys
[03:31:39] <mar2u> i found
[03:31:56] <mar2u> work only when onMouseOver exist
[03:31:57] <mar2u> :D

[04:20:21] <uskerine> hi, while using REGEX in jQuery plugins, how do you say "foo" or "bar"?
[04:35:31] <anli_> If I use div.html(somehtml), can I be sure that if that somehtml contains some images, they will be treated as normal images (loaded with a page load) when it comes to if-modified-since? According to firebug, the browser only tries with 7 images, but there are more, after it has got 7 403 responses, it stops loading images
[04:36:00] <anli_> The rest is not refetched
[04:36:30] <anli_> They actually comes below the scroll area of a dialog, if that is of importance
[04:39:08] <Erwat> anli_: could it be caching the images?
[04:39:42] <anli_> I set Expire to a year ago
[04:40:23] <anli_> I have tried to use max-age as well, but then it seems like firefox never uses If-Modified-Since
[04:40:33] <anli_> Regardless of value I put in it
[04:59:52] <tlz> hello
[05:00:30] <tlz> I have a jinda complex selector: $(this).closest("table").prevAll('table.projekt_gross').first().css('border', '1px solid red');
[05:00:55] <tlz> In this Table.projekt_gross resides a H1, wich I try to catch
[05:01:15] <tlz> I think I have a blackout, can't the selector get to work....
[05:01:28] <Cork> $(this).closest("table").prevAll('table.projekt_gross').first().find('h1')
[05:03:14] <tlz> YES!!
[05:03:18] <tlz> thx a lot!
[05:33:25] <Erwat> possibly a very basic question: when i have a style of an element and the top value is "300px" eg div.css('top') would return "300px"
[05:33:54] <Erwat> what would be the best way to subtract some number of pixels from that? like say 50 (so the result would be "250px"). When I tried Number() on it it returned NaN
[05:34:23] <Erwat> oh, parseInt!
[05:37:16] <amitev> hi all! is there a way to move (clone/appendTo) an element to the body without losing the declared <script> tags because i have values that are set using javascript?
[05:47:58] <kinygos> hi, i have a question that could be javascript related, but it involves jqueryvalidate and creating a validator...is this a suitable channel for it?
[05:48:14] <kinygos> (it's a bit of a n00b question though)
[05:48:30] <dopie> in jquery how do i make where I have a 2 checkboxes and they both need to be checked for the toggle option to occur
[05:48:31] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/sb85g4tx/
[05:49:42] <Jattenalle> dopie, add a .click event to them both, in there check that both are checked, if they are enabled do the "toggle option", if they are not.. don't
[05:50:39] <dopie> Jattenalle, can you fiddle it?
[05:52:13] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/jrm10w2a/  how can i make return a function with singleton ? my return its always undefined
[05:52:35] <kinygos> i'm trying to add a regex validator, but i've misunderstood something.  the closure i'm creating and adding as the validator is losing the reference to the regex pattern http://dpaste.com/0C8YED6
[05:53:14] <kinygos> in that example, when the validator is created, elPattern has the correct attribute value, but when it is called, elPattern is undefined
[05:53:39] <kinygos> could anyone spare a few moments to have a look and let me know where i've gone wrong
[05:55:18] <Jattenalle> dopie, uh.. if(checkbox1.checked && checkbox2.checked){ toggle(whatever)
[06:07:44] <xnotte> http://jsfiddle.net/jrm10w2a/  how can i make return a function with singleton ? my return its always undefined
[06:18:55] <DannyButterman> Hi there
[06:20:51] <DannyButterman> What is the best way to implement a combobox input that could take its data with or without AJAX ?
[06:25:31] <EoN> Does anyone know if/how to truncate/delete all data in an objectstore? (and ideally reset the keys)
[06:25:34] <EoN> in indexeddb
[06:27:35] <DannyButterman> found this http://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/ but not sure it could work for me because I can't find how to use AJAX as data source
[06:31:49] <ocmnt> DannyButterman, you could write a function for the source on the autocomplete widget
[06:31:54] <decx> it's right there in the examples
[06:32:02] <ocmnt> ^
[06:32:08] <decx> source has a response which you can call in the success
[06:34:25] <DannyButterman> ocmnt, decx, ok thanks, I just quite don't see how to handle this thing using jquery.
[06:34:49] <krambiorix> hi, when i change my jquery script, all users have to clear their browser's cache... How can i prevent that?
[06:38:40] <ocmnt> krambiorix, change the cache of js files, or better add versioning with params
[06:40:11] <decx> DannyButterman http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/#remote
[06:40:48] <krambiorix> ocmnt any guid on versioning with params?
[06:41:14] <ocmnt> myfile.js?v=1
[06:41:24] <ocmnt> change the =1 to 1.1 or something else
[06:41:33] <ocmnt> in <script src="myfile.js?v=1"></script>
[06:42:07] <effortDee> hi guys, i've set up a site and i want to clone it to use in another industry, so the fields cant be website1_field_image instead they need to be website2_field_image, how would I go about cloning a website and setting is a sa standard so i can continually re-use really easily or would i be expected to put loads of work in to get this first site i can clone done?
[06:42:31] <effortDee> wrong channel
[06:51:37] <mooncup> how do I bind an autocomplete to a dynamically generated element?
[06:51:59] <mooncup> $('.business-list').on('click', '.add-business-row', function() {
[06:52:05] <mooncup> ^ something like that but for autocomplete
[06:56:13] <decx> you have to do it after you embed
[06:57:23] <mooncup> decx: ok thanks
[06:57:28] <mooncup> that's irritating
[07:02:13] <decx> well you can use a one delegation
[07:02:22] <Ceter|Work> decx: o/
[07:02:43] <decx> \o Ceter|Work
[07:03:11] <decx> mooncup http://jsfiddle.net/hd9h5a1z/
[07:03:41] <mooncup> decx: you're a genius
[07:03:42] <mooncup> thanks
[07:04:05] <decx> the one trick is pretty nifty to not have useless inits on load
[07:04:14] <decx> regardless of delegation
[07:06:06] <mooncup> one other quick question decx
[07:06:21] <mooncup> how do I access the selector for the input that triggered the autocomplete from the success function?
[07:07:08] <decx> cache this into a var beforehand
[07:07:17] <mooncup> ok fair enough
[07:07:19] <mooncup> thanks
[07:12:34] <MarkyC> Say I have <div class=foo><label><div class=bar><input></div></div>.  I have a blur event for the input. How can I add a class to div.foo? Is closest the tool for the job here? $(this).closest('.foo').addClass('baz'); where $(this) is the <input>?
[07:13:29] <decx> it is
[07:20:38] <mooncup> well that's odd
[07:20:48] <mooncup> http://jsfiddle.net/j7y731cf/ I can't seem to get the click event to trigger
[07:21:37] <decx> $('account-id-list')
[07:21:57] <mooncup> thanks
[07:22:00] <mooncup> knew it was something stupid
[07:22:06] <mooncup> it always is :<
[07:22:33] <decx> and not on click
[07:22:35] <decx> one click
[07:22:41] <decx> you dont want to init everaytime
[07:23:08] <mooncup> more inputs are being added dynamically
[07:23:16] <mooncup> don't I need the on to make sure they get caught?
[07:23:24] <mooncup> oh I get what you mean though
[07:23:24] <decx> doesnt matter it'S per element
[07:23:28] <jop008> Any idea why there is no feamle visible> http://jsfiddle.net/7cwv81qk/3/
[07:23:29] <mooncup> I'm gonna end up with hundreds
[07:30:43] <jop008> Any idea why there is no feamle visible> http://jsfiddle.net/7cwv81qk/3/
[07:34:18] <mooncup> decx: the problem with using .one seems to be that only the first clicked input gets bound to
[07:34:24] <mooncup> any others don't have the autocomplete
[07:34:26] <mgpl> jop008: theres a text-indent on a span element
[07:34:37] <mgpl> jop008: span with 'Female'
[07:34:55] <jop008> I take a look
[07:35:33] <jop008> I have no span?
[07:35:38] <jop008> a bug in jqm?
[07:36:13] <mgpl> jop008: jquery ads elements to that switch
[07:36:27] <jop008> so what is wrong?
[07:36:38] <mgpl> jop008: .ui-flipswitch .ui-flipswitch-off {} has text indent
[07:36:51] <mgpl> jop008: check elements in chrome dev tools for example
[07:36:58] <mgpl> jquery ads custom styles
[07:37:21] <mgpl> *adds
[07:37:34] <jop008> but I copied an example from jq demo site
[07:37:40] <jop008> must be working
[07:37:54] <jmaister> Is $(function() {}); a shorthand for $(document).ready(function() {})?
[07:37:58] <jop008> I migrated from version 1.3.2
[07:38:02] <jmaister> Or do they just do the same thing?
[07:38:03] <jop008> to 1.4.3
[07:39:00] <mgpl> jop008: i'm just saying what i'm seeing is happening with that element. it has an indent and it moves the text so it collapses under the switch and is not visible. i dont know your whole implementation
[07:39:01] <jop008> So a bug in jqm?
[07:39:21] <mgpl> if you st that indent to '0' then 'Female' is visible
[07:39:21] <jop008> Just normal jqm site
[07:39:45] <decx> the with of the switchbox doesnt take the length of the off text into account
[07:39:46] <jop008> I copied example from the demo site strange that this has bugs
[07:39:53] <decx> width
[07:40:21] <jop008> But to repair this is taht the way to go on a standard flip box?
[07:41:13] <decx> change the width
[07:41:33] <mgpl> jop008: you can set width of the switch to some bigger value. if you put 'F' in there it will work, if you put 'FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF' it disappears
[07:43:13] <jop008> okay
[07:47:58] <jop008> ugly a downgrade now you need css also not in version 1.32 see http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.3/flipswitch/#&ui-state=dialog
[07:49:36] <mgpl> jop008: thats what you get when you upgrade multiple versions up
[07:50:02] <decx> look at the styles, they apply custom styles to get the flipswitch to have nondefault width
[07:50:49] <jop008> with css it is okay
[08:10:27] <FoolsRun> Hi, is there a quick and easy way to use .replace with a wildcard?  I need to do this:  .replace('file="*"', 'file="' + filename + '"')  but obviously * doesn't work in jQuery
[08:12:37] <jop008> With a view options layout is fine http://jsfiddle.net/7cwv81qk/4/ but with a long list my styling is broken looking like this http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-10-07_at_17.10.20-tBGZnYiM.png
[08:22:30] <NoiseEee> jop008: you've been asking for code/help for months now; it's time to learn css
[08:22:44] <NoiseEee> s/css//
[08:23:04] <jop008> in theire code they change themes to other themes
[08:23:12] <jop008> handy for theming your site
[08:23:37] <jop008> e.g. ui-body-a
[08:26:20] <jop008> hard to crack since you don't know when jq mobile is switching there layout
[08:27:27] <jop008> maybe walk the elements and look for ui-dialog elements and change their style
[08:32:45] <leosw> Hello world

[08:33:16] <leosw> I want to do something when the adress changes (when the anchor changes)

[08:56:28] <jeffmjack_> any idea how I can do this?
[08:56:31] <jeffmjack_> like in a file
[08:57:19] <robertmaxrees> copy the cities array and save it in a file?
[08:57:24] <NoiseEee> you can do localStorage in supported browser jeffmjack_
[08:57:28] <robertmaxrees> not sure exactly what you're looking for.
[08:57:45] <NoiseEee> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Storage @ jeffmjack_
[08:58:25] <jeffmjack_> robertmaxrees: yeah as a text file
[08:58:35] <jeffmjack_> I want to use the array as a variable in a different program
[08:58:58] <NoiseEee> jeffmjack_: JS can't do that.
[08:59:03] <NoiseEee> oh wait maybe
[08:59:04] <robertmaxrees> jeffmjack_ are you looking for any kind of automated saving of it?  or do you just want to copy the data one time?
[08:59:13] <robertmaxrees> if it's the former, you need some kind of server-side language to handle that.
[08:59:14] <jeffmjack_> robertmaxrees:  one time
[08:59:25] <robertmaxrees> latter - just console log it and copy/paste it.
[08:59:39] <jeffmjack_> the list is too big; dev tools truncates it
[09:00:58] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/oy7f78hv/3/
[09:01:01] <robertmaxrees> .toString()
[09:14:52] <jeffmjack_> robertmaxrees: oh, awesome. thanks
[09:14:57] <jeffmjack_> :D
[09:15:03] <robertmaxrees> yep
[09:20:15] <edrahn> Why doesn't the following uncheck the second checkbox? http://jsfiddle.net/tzzhf6n9/
[09:20:41] <robertmaxrees> syntax error.
[09:20:45] <robertmaxrees> open your console and you'll see.
[09:20:51] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: how would one autoscroll an overflow div on the y-axis ?
[09:21:29] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear http://api.jquery.com/scrolltop/ is what you'd use.
[09:21:42] <robertmaxrees> $('overflowedElement').scrollTop();
[09:21:47] <robertmaxrees> $('overflowedElement').scrollTop(50000000);
[09:24:07] <jop008> I can not style my select box they look ugly with my created theme like this http://picpaste.com/upload.php any option? I looked over Chrome CSS inspect element
[09:24:35] <robertmaxrees> jop008 wrong image url...
[09:24:47] <jop008> The selctbox can only be opened once
[09:25:04] <jop008> http://picpaste.com/Screen_Shot_2014-10-07_at_18.22.28-jZatbjxW.png
[09:25:44] <robertmaxrees> jop008 http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4148499/how-to-style-checkbox-using-css
[09:25:52] <robertmaxrees> basically, you have to roll a lot of your own stuff.
[09:27:30] <jop008> now only data theming with the theme roller
[09:27:33] <jop008> nothing more
[09:28:57] <yosito> I'm having trouble with the `done()` callback not firing on jQuery ajax requests in IE. So far, Google results haven't solved the issue.
[09:29:08] <yosito> Anyone here familiar with that issue?
[09:29:16] <robertmaxrees> yosito are .fail() callbacks working?
[09:29:42] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: thank you it works great, the 500000000 is how many lines ? it can scroll up to ?
[09:29:58] <robertmaxrees> check the docs duder :)
[09:30:39] <yosito> I tried adding a fail callback and it wasn't called eitehr.
[09:30:58] <robertmaxrees> yosito any console error?
[09:32:27] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: yea its the position to scroll to based on pixels, but what i mean i guess is that if that position is exceeded it simply will stop scrolling ? not that i plan to have that much in the overflow just woundering how that works :P
[09:33:04] <yosito> robertmaxrees: No console error. Here's a gist; https://gist.github.com/josiahsprague/2f9f7801af61671cb2d6
[09:33:43] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ebfL6a8n/
[09:33:48] <doug_> yosito: add .fail(function() { console.log('failed'); });   at the end
[09:34:07] <jop008> it is not a checkbox it is  a selectbox they change styling when the number of elements is large
[09:34:24] <robertmaxrees> yosito wait is it that done doesn't work, or that it doesn't work in IE9?
[09:35:05] <yosito> That it doesnt work in IE9 robertmaxrees
[09:35:08] <robertmaxrees> yosito which version of jquery are you using?
[09:35:17] <yosito> doug_: Let me try that... I'll report back in a second
[09:35:39] <Poppabear> robertmaxrees: ahh i see how it works, thank you again
[09:35:39] <robertmaxrees> i just asked if you tried using a fail callback... >.>
[09:36:14] <robertmaxrees> Poppabear the safest way to find stuff out is to try :)
[09:36:48] <yosito> robertmaxrees: Apparently I did the fail callback wrong
[09:36:57] <robertmaxrees> how were you doing it before?
[09:37:08] <yosito> doug_ robertmaxrees, the fail callback fires in IE9
[09:37:42] <doug_> yosito: in the browser's debugger, have you looked at the network pane and looked at that request?
[09:39:01] <yosito> doug_: The network pane doesn't show any request happening
[09:39:28] <doug_> yosito: you might have to reproduce the whole thing from the start with that pane already visible
[09:39:40] <yosito> Yeah, I did that. And the pane is capturing.
[09:40:10] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/ldupadq/ try passing and console.log()ing these args.
[09:40:16] <robertmaxrees> maybe that'll tell you something.
[09:41:47] <doug_> yosito: you aren't testing it locally right? the protocol isn't file:/// right?
[09:42:10] <yosito> No, I've got a dev server set up.
[09:42:19] <yosito> LOG: [object Object]
[09:42:19] <yosito> LOG: error
[09:42:19] <yosito> LOG: No Transport
[09:42:28] <yosito> robertmaxrees: That's my output ^
[09:43:12] <robertmaxrees> this is going to sound weird, but try setting $.support.cors = true; before the ajax call.
[09:43:15] <robertmaxrees> does that work?
[09:43:35] <robertmaxrees> or do crossDomain: true, in the options for the ajax call.
[09:43:53] <doug_> yosito: which browser?
[09:43:59] <robertmaxrees> IE9.
[09:44:03] <yosito> IE9
[09:44:59] <krambiorix> $("body").height() returns 92 ... What could be the problem?
[09:45:19] <yosito> I already have crossDomain: true robertmaxrees let me try $.support.cors = true
[09:46:19] <doug_> krambiorix: the content is only 92 pixels high. you want it to fill the visible space?
[09:46:59] <krambiorix> doug_, yes
[09:47:46] <jakey> robertmaxrees: is it worth it to make an application a jQuery plugin or try to keep it standalone
[09:47:49] <yosito> Setting $.support.cors = true ends up giving me an errorThrown value of 'Error: Access is denied.' robertmaxrees so maybe I need to add the domain I'm working with to the server's response.
[09:49:03] <krambiorix> doug_, ?
[09:49:14] <robertmaxrees> jakey i wouldn't.
[09:49:33] <robertmaxrees> yosito are you making the request from the same port, protocol, and domain?
[09:49:38] <jakey> thanks max
[09:49:50] <yosito> robertmaxrees: It's a cross domain request.
[09:50:21] <krambiorix> robertmaxrees, any idea?
[09:50:25] <doug_> krambiorix: http://jsfiddle.net/xfbz4g5n/
[09:50:44] <doug_> krambiorix: the css is the important part. the rest is just for testing
[09:51:10] <robertmaxrees> yosito btw it's dataType - capital T
[09:52:48] <robertmaxrees> yosito i'd start looking at things like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8369611/ie9-no-transport-error-firefox-chrome-work-and-the-request-is-not-cross-site at this point
[09:53:04] <doug_> yosito: Have you tried it on chrome or ff?
[09:53:28] <doug_> yosito: to have a better idea of whether this is an IE problem or other problem
[09:53:34] <yosito> robertmaxrees: yeah, I had a lowercase T, but I get the same result if I fix that.
[09:53:46] <yosito> doug_: It's only a problem in IE.
[09:54:10] <krambiorix> doug_, thanks!
[09:57:06] <doug_> yosito: do you have control over the server side code? if I were you I would proxy those through your webserver
[09:57:38] <doug_> i.e. do an ajax request to your own server, then do the crossdomain thing in the server code, and just pass back the response from your server
[09:59:01] <doug_> yosito: these CORS problems are enforced by the browser. your server is free to do cross domain calls to its heart's content
[09:59:30] <BillCriswell> It's time for DEVO. Which should be playing every time you write some jQuery.
[09:59:56] <uskerine> hi, which wuold be the right REGEX to specify "contains FOO or contains BAR"
[09:59:58] <uskerine> ?
[10:00:14] <doug_> uskerine: /FOO|BAR/
[10:00:16] <BillCriswell> uskerine: FOO|BAR,
[10:00:27] <uskerine> FOO|BAR is not working
[10:00:39] <uskerine> I am trying to filter in datatables
[10:00:42] <uskerine> should that work?
[10:01:36] <robertmaxrees> doug_ if it's only an issue in IE9, then you shouldn't need to change your entire setup to support it.
[10:01:52] <doug_> robertmaxrees: entire setup?
[10:02:08] <BillCriswell> uskerine: Do you just need a true false?
[10:02:12] <robertmaxrees> you shouldn't need to change the request to hit your server and then make the request via the server.
[10:02:29] <BillCriswell> /foo|bar/i.test(whatever) would work
[10:02:29] <uskerine> I have a column which can contain several values (FOO, FOO2, BAR, etc.)
[10:02:30] <doug_> robertmaxrees: it's not the first time I gave up on IE CORS... good luck though, if you figure it out I'd love to hear how
[10:02:47] <BillCriswell> uskerine: I'd use $inArray in that case.
[10:02:52] <BillCriswell> $.inArray()
[10:02:55] <uskerine> and I am trying to filter based on which values user selects (so it can be only BAR, only FOO, BAR+FOO+FOO2, etc.
[10:02:56] <robertmaxrees> yosito are you doing a cross-domain request?  or is it the same domain?
[10:03:33] <BillCriswell> uskerine: It sounds like you'd want inArray.
[10:03:37] <yosito> robertmaxrees: It's a cross-domain request. Just realized if I change dataType to 'jsonp' instead of 'json' it works. Investigating if that solves the issue or not.
[10:03:50] <uskerine> BillCriswell datatables asks for the REGEX directly: http://www.datatables.net/examples/api/regex.html
[10:03:52] <BillCriswell> Something like $.inArray(someString, ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']) > -1
[10:03:57] <robertmaxrees> that would bypass part of the problem, yosito :)
[10:03:59] <doug_> robertmaxrees: I've seen people sink days into fighting IE... in the long run proxying is faster and is practically guaranteed to always work
[10:04:19] <robertmaxrees> doug_ that's not true in my experience, but OK :)
[10:04:45] <robertmaxrees> yosito are you in control of the server you're request from?
[10:05:05] <yosito> robertmaxrees: Not personally, but someone else at my company is.
[10:05:19] <robertmaxrees> because jsonp might be the easiest route if it's supported.
[10:05:55] <doug_> robertmaxrees: that would send cookies crossdomain?
[10:06:06] <doug_> doubtful
[10:06:30] <BillCriswell> uskerine: On that page if I want support engineers I can do like "eng sup" so that might be enough for you.
[10:06:44] <BillCriswell> in the position field.
[10:07:21] <robertmaxrees> doug_ cookies don't go through any cross domain request in 8 and 9, but without knowing more about their setup, JSONP may fit the bill.
[10:07:33] <robertmaxrees> iirc 8 and 9 strip authentication and cookies entirely.
[10:08:05] <uskerine> mmm, I will try that too, I was trying (eng|sup) but for some reason that's not working in my "live" datatables
[10:08:22] <uskerine> -though it works on the examples page-
[10:09:54] <doug_> robertmaxrees: withCredentials is there to make it send cookies
[10:10:42] <doug_> yosito: you need the cookies to be sent to that cross-domain ajax server right?
[10:10:58] <robertmaxrees> XDomainRequest does not support withCredentials, doug_
[10:11:17] <luxigo> hi ! I am reluctant to bind events to the dom... however if i bind an custom event on an arbitrary object with eg a class instance with "a=new Array(); $(a).on('custom',function(){}) ... " is the event bound to the DOM somehow  or does it imply only internal scheming ?
[10:11:36] <doug_> robertmaxrees: that's wrong. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[10:11:37] <robertmaxrees> luxigo woah that's... not how you do binding.
[10:11:48] <robertmaxrees> doug_ not for IE8 and 9.
[10:12:05] <robertmaxrees> they don't use XMLHttpRequest
[10:12:49] <doug_> robertmaxrees: therefore you have to proxy CORS on crap browsers, right?
[10:13:15] <yosito> doug_, robertmaxrees, thanks for the help! I resolved the issue. Part of the solution was to use a dataType of 'jsonp' in IE9, but it'll also require some server side changes. Thanks!
[10:13:18] <robertmaxrees> totally depends on the use case, but something tells me you're just going to argue with anything I say at this point ;)
[10:13:38] <robertmaxrees> yosito awesome - if you don't need the authentication, then JSONP is a good solution to that one.
[10:13:38] <doug_> yosito: if that worked then withCredentials was unnecessary
[10:14:02] <doug_> robertmaxrees: hey I'd love for you to prove me wrong here
[10:14:26] <doug_> that CORS+cookie stuff is a PITA
[10:14:26] <robertmaxrees> i just did hahahaha.  he can use JSONP or not require authentication if it's not necessary.
[10:14:44] <doug_> robertmaxrees: no you didn't. it isn't withCredential
[10:15:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:15:05] <doug_> robertmaxrees: but hey, he didn't need it so that can and did work
[10:15:16] <robertmaxrees> kay
[10:15:51] <doug_> robertmaxrees: I'm not here to show up anyone :D
[10:16:04] <robertmaxrees> not saying you are.
[10:16:18] <robertmaxrees> i was saying that you can do cross-domain ajax in old IE just fine depending on the use case.
[10:16:25] <robertmaxrees> that's all i intended at least.
[10:17:20] <doug_> luxigo: why are you reluctant? you want to use event propagation you mean?
[10:17:28] <luxigo> hi ! I am reluctant to bind events to the dom... however if i bind an custom event on an arbitrary object with eg a class instance (see http://jsfiddle.net/emufwu23/) is the event bound to the DOM somehow  or does it imply only internal scheming ?
[10:17:31] <robertmaxrees> luxigo your example doesn't make any sense.
[10:17:48] <robertmaxrees> why don't you want to bind to the document?
[10:18:38] <Horacsio> I need it to slideup on mouseenter: http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/8v6kqjko/4/
[10:18:41] <luxigo> actually dont mind but my friend is reluctant... so i look for a way to avoid binding to the dom (binding to object instance instead)
[10:18:55] <robertmaxrees> why are they reluctant?
[10:19:16] <doug_> luxigo: that doesn't make sense. they probably heard that you shouldn'
[10:19:20] <luxigo> morons are reluctant :-) but i prefer avoid conflict than try to change people's mind :-)
[10:19:30] <doug_> t bind to elements but they should use event propagation
[10:19:31] <mbrzuzy> Hi guys, is there a way to keep .one() bound if conditions for my code aren't met?
[10:19:37] <mbrzuzy> or should I just use on/off
[10:19:37] <robertmaxrees> then you don't want events, luxigo
[10:19:54] <robertmaxrees> mbrzuzy check conditions within .on() to see if the code should run.
[10:20:00] <doug_> mbrzuzy: you can rebind in the .one, or just remove the event handler at the appropriate time with .off
[10:20:26] <mbrzuzy> Hmm, okay.  I guess I'll just use on and then unbind with off when I need to
[10:20:35] <mbrzuzy> I thought there might have been a way to return false to keep the binding
[10:20:36] <mbrzuzy> thanks guys :0
[10:20:38] <mbrzuzy> :)*
[10:20:42] <robertmaxrees> why not just check to see if the logic should run in the handler?
[10:21:03] <uskerine> BillCriswell, ok I found it, datatables enables to render certain columns, and search function does not work fine with rendered stuff. I included a hidden column with the raw information and filtered using that one
[10:21:32] <mbrzuzy> That's what I'm doing robertmaxrees
[10:21:50] <robertmaxrees> mbrzuzy that should be fine, instead of incurring the overhead of adding/removing listeners.
[10:22:06] <mbrzuzy> oh well, it's two seperate events
[10:22:19] <luxigo> i ... hu say he ... he want to trigger events for a class instance, but not to trigger events to the dom element the object instance use as container...  yeah it sucks for hooks :-) ...  how could i argument against this ?...
[10:22:22] <doug_> robertmaxrees: overhead? come on
[10:22:27] <mbrzuzy> i first detect hover, then i detect mouseleave, but i dont trigger the mouseleave code if it enters into another li
[10:22:45] <robertmaxrees> doug_ whatever broseph.  you just want to argue.  i give up.  fuckit.
[10:23:05] <doug_> really?
[10:23:15] <mbrzuzy> hmm
[10:24:40] <luxigo> talking about object instance state events (ie: ready, update) that can be triggered by ajax (nothing related to GUI)
[10:24:57] <doug_> luxigo: they might be doing something like MVC where they want to trigger events on the model object when it changes
[10:25:02] <luxigo> that's why it should not be bound to DOM
[10:27:14] <luxigo> i will present the possiblity to bind to object instances, hence the question:  in that case (http://jsfiddle.net/emufwu23/) is the event bound to the DOM somehow or does it imply only jQuery javascript internal schemin ?..
[10:28:39] <luxigo> priori not i guess..
[10:28:44] <doug_> luxigo: js has a way to synthesize artificial events and raise them
[10:31:00] <doug_> luxigo: I suspect that jquery is doing something with the DOM, but why does that matter?
[10:38:14] <luxigo> doug_: possibly... something like $(window).on('yo',a, ... i guess.....  I have no idea why it does matter for him though, beside "why to bind to the DOM when you can hook to instance methods" :-)
[10:38:27] <xckpd7> question... what type of negatives should I be aware of if I want to attach a listener to 'body' to check if an element exists
[10:38:44] <xckpd7> e.g. $('body').on("click", "ELEMENT", function()[
[10:39:31] <xckpd7> I need to use jquery to target a button of this modal which doesn't exist on the page, but I'm concerned about creating a click handler at a top level element such as body
[10:42:01] <luxigo> xckpd7: bind the closer you can from the not yet existing element
[10:42:29] <mbrzuzy> oh doug_, is the extra overhead of binding/unbinding events really a concern?
[10:42:41] <xckpd7> luxigo: the problem is, is I don't control where the modal is inserted in the DOM, which is basically right under body
[10:42:58] <xckpd7> so the closest I can do is body
[10:43:17] <doug_> mbrzuzy: if there are hundreds or more, then it can become significant. for one element event that changes at the speed of human UI input, it's negligible
[10:44:23] <mbrzuzy> Cool, thanks man
[10:44:42] <doug_> mbrzuzy: try timing it. I'd be surprised if it takes long enough to even show more than 0 time elapsed (too fast for the timer resolution probably)
[10:44:44] <luxigo> xckpd7: if there's no solution, there's no problem
[10:45:36] <doug_> mbrzuzy: you can do 3D transformations on multiple objects by spammong changes to their css and maintain 60+ frames per second. one event handler is nothing
[10:45:53] <xckpd7> luxigo: i can perhaps dive into the source of the plugin and try to do some craziness, but the reason for my question was to figure out how bad it is to be attaching listeners to 'body'
[10:46:33] <xckpd7> obviously I can only attach alistener to the body in this case, but I have alternatives in the sense that I can change the source of the plugin... so my question stands... what type of negatives am I running into by doing this
[10:47:19] <doug_> xckpd7: it's not "bad" at all
[10:47:52] <doug_> xckpd7: why do you think it is bad?
[10:48:45] <xckpd7> doug_: either performance or best practices. I've always know that using delegate type functionality, it's best to use the closest element I'm sure exists to put the listener / handler on
[10:49:03] <xckpd7> but again I don't know, hence the question. If it's not bad I'll do it
[10:49:58] <jesteracer> hello, can anyone tell, if i should do anything specific to manipulate the dom inside contenteditable div when i want to delete stuff from it?
[10:51:02] <doug_> xckpd7: as long as the handler doesn't do too much, it is fine
[10:51:25] <doug_> xckpd7: ..doesn't do too much EVERY time
[10:52:55] <doug_> xckpd7: are you pre-optimizing? don't. run a profiler and see if that handler even uses 1%. I'd be surprised if the cpu time were more than negligible
[10:53:54] <xckpd7> doug_: I mean my page is slow enough as it is... I don't think I can call anything pre-optimizing at this point
[10:54:07] <xckpd7> but thanks... I'll just go ahead and do it, whatever
[10:54:12] <doug_> xckpd7: sounds like you need to profile the page and see what is causing slowness
[10:54:24] <doug_> xckpd7: you know what I mean by "profile" right?
[10:55:04] <doug_> xckpd7: ok, but slowness isn'
[10:55:39] <doug_> t justification to try to make everything fast from then on. every minute you spend optimizing the wrong thing is a minute you could have spent really fixing the performance
[10:58:11] <doug_> xckpd7: can you give a link to your test server? I'll profile it and see if any causes are obvious
[10:58:19] <doug_> if yu like
[10:59:10] <axilla> hi all i am working on instagram integration for our app.. we let our users select images from their instagram feed to import into our app.. i'm allowing them to select the images by just adding a class to the image onclick called selected.. the jquery works fine accept after we paginate.. when we "load more" images the images that were first loaded are no longer selectable while all images loaded with "load more" are.. any ideas? https://gist
[10:59:45] <doug_> axilla: you need to use event delegation
[10:59:55] <doug_> axilla: can you show the code that binds the events?
[11:02:50] <axilla> doug_: i updated the gist
[11:03:03] <axilla> JBreit2: hahaha i see you(bassclef)
[11:03:15] <JBreit2> sup
[11:03:23] <axilla> its rails code, so that's pretty much the gist of JS code used.
[11:03:23] <JBreit2> how you been man?
[11:03:25] <axilla> good
[11:03:36] <JBreit2> not used to catching you on this network
[11:04:07] <JBreit> this is my normal ID on this network compared to social
[11:04:14] <doug_> axilla: the url is cut off
[11:04:30] <axilla> https://gist.github.com/travisdmathis/9ceff9b01863f8f43450
[11:05:00] <axilla> everything works as it should, i just can't select the first original 15 images i load.
[11:06:24] <axilla> after appending more elements to the original elements.. the original elements can't have classes added to it it seems
[11:06:30] <axilla> or the click function isn't responding
[11:06:33] <doug_> axilla: http://jsfiddle.net/2aeug7Lh/
[11:07:09] <doug_> axilla: instead of .clickable put a selector there that would match the things for which you want events
[11:07:32] <doug_> axilla: that will work for newly added elements without doing anything to "update" the event handlers
[11:07:32] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events for some good info.
[11:09:36] <robertmaxrees> you can even bind further down than document so you don't have to watch every click event that occurs on the page - only the ones in the specific area you care about.
[11:09:39] <axilla> ahhhh
[11:09:43] <axilla> very cool, thanks!
[11:11:10] <jesteracer> have anyone used medium-editor in a way when you used pasteHTML? i whould really be glad to have some help on this topic
[11:13:03] <robertmaxrees> jesteracer probably not the best channel for that, but somebody might know?
[11:14:34] <jesteracer> robertmaxrees well, yeah, could not find any better place to ask for help %)
[11:14:36] <doug_> jesteracer: I have the docs open. what is the problem?
[11:14:54] <robertmaxrees> jesteracer just pointing out it's offtopic.
[11:15:34] <jesteracer> doug_ https://github.com/daviferreira/medium-editor/issues/306
[11:16:41] <jesteracer> the problem is mainly when i delete an element with jquery .remove() and the editor goes nuts. I thougt that, maybe, I am doing it wrong and must not do it via jquery.
[11:18:35] <mystronyx> When I drag a jQuery UI draggable <li>, it only drags the text. I want it to drag the entire box with the text. How could I do that?
[11:21:44] <axilla> hmmm that still isn't working for me.. must be something else
[11:21:54] <axilla> ohhh i think i know why
[11:26:12] <axilla> doug_: the fix for my situation seemed to be to use .live('click')
[11:26:25] <axilla> just fyi
[11:26:38] <robertmaxrees> axilla use .on() - live has been deprecated.
[11:26:38] <axilla> but, thanks again, you pointed me down the right path regardless
[11:26:49] <robertmaxrees> what version of jquery are you using?
[11:28:06] <axilla> tbh not sure exact version one seco
[11:28:13] <robertmaxrees> you can do $.fn.jquery to find out.
[11:28:39] <axilla> 1.8.34
[11:28:41] <axilla> 1.8.3
[11:29:06] <robertmaxrees> interesting.  .on() should work totally fine.  might be that you're bindind to somethat that doesn't exist on pageload.
[11:29:25] <axilla> hmm
[11:29:30] <axilla> i'll double check, thx
[11:29:50] <axilla> i tried .on('click', '.clickable', function() and got the exact same results
[11:29:52] <doug_> jesteracer: http://jsfiddle.net/078wgq3u/   <-- update that to better match your scenario
[11:29:59] <robertmaxrees> axilla you said it works?
[11:30:07] <axilla> robertmaxrees: with .live?
[11:30:10] <axilla> yea it works just fine
[11:30:12] <robertmaxrees> axilla with .on()
[11:30:16] <axilla> no it does not.
[11:30:18] <axilla> let me try again though
[11:30:20] <robertmaxrees> what are you running .on() against?
[11:30:35] <axilla> image_tag(media_item.images.thumbnail.url, :class => "clickable")
[11:30:48] <robertmaxrees> hahaha i have no idea what that translates to with vanilla JS.
[11:31:43] <axilla> its just an image with click clickable
[11:31:52] <doug_> probably <img src="...tht url..." class="clickable">
[11:31:55] <axilla> with the class clickable*
[11:32:00] <axilla> yep exactly
[11:32:01] <robertmaxrees> axilla i mean the first part - the selector.
[11:32:14] <robertmaxrees> $('thiselement').on('event', 'child', function() {});
[11:32:30] <axilla> .instagram_thumbs.on('click', '.clickable' function()
[11:32:39] <axilla> one sec
[11:32:44] <axilla> let met get the gist
[11:32:58] <robertmaxrees> you need to bind to a parent of the clickable that exists on pageload is my point.
[11:33:14] <axilla> ahhh
[11:33:32] <robertmaxrees> that's why i linked to you the direct and delegated events thinger from earlier.
[11:37:54] <doug_> axilla: in case you are confused about the documentation not mentioning .live, that is obsolete and removed from newer jq
[11:38:12] <robertmaxrees> doug_ i mentioned .live() deprecated earlier ;)
[11:39:37] <doug_> oh
[11:44:57] <doug_> jesteracer: you still around?
[11:45:31] <jesteracer> yep
[11:45:49] <jesteracer> updated the fiddle, but now it seems to work
[11:50:19] <jesteracer> and i have no idea, why
[11:52:44] <doug_> jesteracer: try using the js and css I used in the fiddle (under external resources, right click copy link)
[11:52:57] <doug_> jesteracer: on your real page
[11:53:00] <doug_> as a test
[11:53:27] <doug_> jesteracer: I ripped them from his demo btw
[11:53:34] <doug_> had trouble finding CDN
[11:53:48] <jesteracer> yeah i will, maybee i am using a buggy version. thanx!
[11:53:55] <robertmaxrees> https://rawgit.com/ btw
[11:54:54] <doug_> robertmaxrees: thanks
[12:04:33] <Respek> afternoon all!
[12:04:38] <doug_> hi
[12:04:56] <robertmaxrees> goooood afternood
[12:04:59] <robertmaxrees> *noon hahahahaha
[12:05:01] <SightUp> hi all
[12:05:16] <doug_> afternood lol
[12:05:19] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:05:21] <SightUp> hopfully the community is better here!
[12:05:23] <robertmaxrees> hello SightUp
[12:05:29] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[12:05:38] <SightUp> eh, coming from javascript
[12:05:44] <SightUp> i am a complete noob
[12:05:46] <SightUp> dont know anything
[12:05:47] <Respek> haha
[12:05:47] <doug_> yeah those guys can be harsh
[12:05:53] <SightUp> so i need my hand held
[12:05:56] <robertmaxrees> didn't you get banned in #css yesterday?
[12:05:59] <Respek> well, to be fair free work isn't really a great ask anywhere
[12:06:08] <SightUp> maybe. i get banned from a lot of places
[12:06:14] <SightUp> i am not looking for free work
[12:06:15] <SightUp> i want to learn
[12:06:20] <robertmaxrees> okay.  what's up?
[12:06:23] <SightUp> but no one wants to be patient with me
[12:06:32] <SightUp> so our website is www.particlegaming.com
[12:06:37] <Respek> fair enough, I did only catch the tail end of the chat
[12:06:41] <Respek> just loggef it
[12:06:45] <Respek> *logged in
[12:06:51] <SightUp> i am working on the rotating banner presently
[12:07:08] <SightUp> i am trying to immulate www.elevate.gg
[12:07:37] <robertmaxrees> you want a carousel.
[12:07:38] <SightUp> i want when you load into the page, the center area is showing
[12:07:44] <SightUp> brb water
[12:07:49] <Respek> Here's a good'n http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[12:08:04] <robertmaxrees> bxslider is another good one.  tons of choices.
[12:08:33] <SightUp> dont i have that already?
[12:08:34] <decx> or jcarousel like that example page uses -.-
[12:08:49] <SightUp> i just want to customize it at this point
[12:09:04] <SightUp> i want to make sure its always centered
[12:09:41] <robertmaxrees> #container { margin: 0 auto; }, where #container is the element that holds the banner
[12:09:43] <robertmaxrees> css
[12:10:01] <Respek> ^^ the man knows his stuff!
[12:10:10] <Respek> Do you know how to set classes in elements on a page?
[12:10:10] <SightUp> ok 1 moment
[12:10:11] <doug_> SightUp: so you want to use incorrectly sized images and force them to fit?
[12:10:19] <SightUp> erm no
[12:10:24] <SightUp> basically if you load the site
[12:10:33] <SightUp> not full screened
[12:10:58] <SightUp> i want it to load centered no matter what
[12:11:10] <robertmaxrees> yep - css.  margin: 0 auto;
[12:11:13] <SightUp> like what you see http://elevate.gg/
[12:11:20] <SightUp> ok one sec while i find that
[12:11:21] <doug_> SightUp: it takes up my whole 1366x768 laptop
[12:11:22] <robertmaxrees> well, that's horizontal centering, but you get the idea.
[12:11:25] <doug_> ...screen
[12:11:33] <SightUp> erm, most gamers use 1920+
[12:12:00] <robertmaxrees> SightUp i shouldn't need to have a site fullscreen to use it ;)
[12:12:09] <Respek> after we finish here, would like to have a philosophical conversation on orienting to a new library w. out a ton of documentation
[12:12:23] <SightUp> eh, forums would be the only thing actually useful on the site
[12:12:27] <SightUp> the rest is cosmetic
[12:12:34] <Respek> SightUp: I'd actually say that less is more usually
[12:12:48] <Respek> in terms of design, there's no need to pack every sq inch with content
[12:12:58] <robertmaxrees> SightUp we're just pointing it out.  we're professionals here.
[12:13:10] <SightUp> i understand and believe me, i have removed about 10 pages from the site that other clans use
[12:13:21] <Respek> ok :)
[12:13:37] <SightUp> whats that pastebin site you coders use?
[12:13:37] <Respek> what gmt are you?
[12:13:43] <Respek> jsfiddle
[12:13:44] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle is a good one.
[12:13:49] <robertmaxrees> fixee.org is good, too.
[12:13:53] <decx> i think there's only one gmt ^^
[12:14:19] <doug_> SightUp: with jsfiddle we can run and debug. anything that runs the html/css/js for you is good. jsfiddle is one of the originals
[12:14:23] <Respek> decx: excellent, if pedantic point, what gmt+ are you (more accurate?)
[12:14:32] <decx> i'll allow it
[12:14:42] <robertmaxrees> Respek you mean GMT offset - there are - values, too :D
[12:14:42] <SightUp> is this the code i need to look for?
[12:14:42] <SightUp> http://fixee.org/paste/lataozw/
[12:14:57] <robertmaxrees> SightUp no clue.  setup a test case in jsfiddle.
[12:15:09] <robertmaxrees> http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ is a great guide if you get stuck doing that.
[12:15:18] <SightUp> well i am just looking for
[12:15:18] <SightUp> margin: 0 auto;
[12:15:23] <robertmaxrees> erm....
[12:15:27] <decx> these are pretty basic questions, and css at that. maybe hit up #web *chuckle*
[12:15:29] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to add that to the correct element.
[12:15:36] <Respek> well no
[12:15:38] <robertmaxrees> SightUp you're trying to run before you can walk.
[12:15:40] <Respek> it'd be #container { margin: 0 auto; },
[12:16:05] <SightUp> like i said, money was taken.... i have no coder... i am trying to get our site finished...
[12:16:16] <SightUp> would be great if i can just finish this and be done.
[12:16:27] <robertmaxrees> right, but you don't have the requisite knowledge to acomplish what you want.
[12:16:38] <SightUp> doing what i can
[12:16:41] <Respek> SightUp: What is your timezone
[12:16:43] <SightUp> so please, work with me
[12:16:44] <SightUp> CST
[12:16:53] <robertmaxrees> we're guiding you to understanding what you need to do.
[12:17:01] <robertmaxrees> so setup a test case for starters and we'll go from there :)
[12:17:12] <SightUp> test case? where?
[12:17:17] <robertmaxrees> jsfiddle
[12:17:31] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/ specifically.
[12:17:53] <SightUp> http://jsfiddle.net/mqwk2wyd/
[12:17:55] <SightUp> done
[12:18:02] <robertmaxrees> that's not a test case.
[12:18:05] <robertmaxrees> that's copy/pasted CSS.
[12:18:10] <robertmaxrees> we need something we can run.
[12:18:24] <robertmaxrees> try setting up what you've got so far for your current banner.
[12:19:44] <SightUp> http://jsfiddle.net/mqwk2wyd/1/
[12:19:45] <Respek> No need to get overwhelmed though, just the banner html (use the inspector to find it)! take as little html as you can, and we can start directing you to a jquery plugin which will accomplish your goals.
[12:19:46] <SightUp> nothing shows
[12:20:00] <robertmaxrees> Respek you're missing the HTML you need.
[12:20:12] <Respek> am I ;)
[12:20:20] <robertmaxrees> err, SightUp hhahaha
[12:20:33] <Respek> haha it's fine, I'm similar in nature I suppose
[12:20:33] <robertmaxrees> and the plugin for the carousel.
[12:20:39] <robertmaxrees> nah, you're not at all.
[12:20:47] <SightUp> i dont know what else to put
[12:20:54] <SightUp> to many files..........................
[12:20:54] <robertmaxrees> the html for the carousel.
[12:21:01] <robertmaxrees> just the html for the carousel.
[12:21:03] <SightUp> where can i find it?
[12:21:18] <robertmaxrees> dunno how your shit is structured, but you could use your developer tools to select and copy it.
[12:21:41] <SightUp> the style editor stuff?
[12:21:45] <robertmaxrees> the HTML.
[12:21:48] <Respek> yep :) highlight the section, then right click and inspect element
[12:22:02] <SightUp> style editor?
[12:22:04] <doug_> SightUp: the last css thing is missing the closing }
[12:22:06] <SightUp> i dont have a html tab
[12:22:16] <robertmaxrees> SightUp what browser are you in?
[12:22:28] <SightUp> FF
[12:22:37] <robertmaxrees> inspector is the tab you want.
[12:22:55] <robertmaxrees> right click the parent element on the container and select "Copy Outer HTML"
[12:22:56] <Respek> SightUp: I think this will help, maybe do a readthrough to get some context: http://marthar.github.io/startupExercises/3.html
[12:23:14] <SightUp> this is nothing Respek
[12:23:25] <Respek> excuse me?
[12:23:29] <Paradisee> hello o/
[12:23:36] <SightUp> its just a page nothing clickable
[12:23:52] <robertmaxrees> SightUp click the right arrow on your keyboar.d
[12:24:00] <robertmaxrees> or spacebar
[12:24:10] <SightUp> i am sooooooooo confused.... to many people telling me what to do
[12:24:13] <Respek> or this http://marthar.github.io/startupExercises/3.html#slide-0
[12:24:19] <robertmaxrees> Respek you're confuing them.
[12:24:27] <Paradisee> how can i change the position value of an element by sending the new value to the json file, each time i drag and drop it in a new place?
[12:24:46] <Paradisee> http://jsfiddle.net/hxttz0jx/32/
[12:24:50] <SightUp> [14:19] <robertmaxrees> right click the parent element on the container and select "Copy Outer HTML"  <- under style editor?
[12:24:50] <Respek> apologies
[12:25:02] <robertmaxrees> SightUp under "inspector"
[12:25:24] <robertmaxrees> if you say "style editor" one more time.... hahahaha
[12:25:33] <SightUp> http://jsfiddle.net/mqwk2wyd/3/
[12:25:36] <SightUp> this is what i got
[12:25:46] <robertmaxrees> dude not all of your HTML/
[12:25:50] <robertmaxrees> just the HTML for the banner.
[12:26:08] <SightUp> how do i know where that starts and ends?
[12:26:22] <robertmaxrees> by inspecting the relevant part of the page.
[12:26:58] <SightUp> how about this?
[12:26:58] <SightUp> http://jsfiddle.net/mqwk2wyd/4/
[12:27:32] <robertmaxrees> you have to tell us, yo.
[12:27:39] <robertmaxrees> try going up a level and copying from there.
[12:27:54] <SightUp> http://jsfiddle.net/mqwk2wyd/5/
[12:27:59] <SightUp> it just copied that picture i just finished
[12:28:19] <robertmaxrees> okay - so this is all three slides?
[12:29:09] <SightUp> that's on three slides as its on all of it
[12:29:56] <doug_> SightUp: $("#ff").addClass("active-page") is questionable. why is it doing that exact id?
[12:30:09] <robertmaxrees> the pasted js has nothing to do wiuth the slider :)
[12:30:18] <doug_> :O
[12:30:36] <SightUp> no idea. i know there is a cms and admin panel that does stuff
[12:30:54] <SightUp> could that be pulling info from it?
[12:31:17] <robertmaxrees> SightUp the JS you paste is irrelevant./
[12:31:40] <doug_> ah right, sorry, forgot the only thing we care about is the slider being centered. was just doing general code review
[12:31:51] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there are some nightmares in here.
[12:31:59] <robertmaxrees> SightUp http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/mqwk2wyd/8/
[12:32:03] <doug_> anyway, I cleaned it up a little http://jsfiddle.net/mqwk2wyd/7/
[12:32:03] <robertmaxrees> this is the relevant code.
[12:32:50] <robertmaxrees> SightUp try .slider { margin: 0 auto; } in your css.
[12:33:03] <robertmaxrees> and set the width to something like 980px for starters.
[12:33:14] <SightUp> fc_slider.css?
[12:33:18] <SightUp> put it there?
[12:33:22] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't edit that file, no.
[12:33:32] <SightUp> global.css?
[12:33:33] <robertmaxrees> find your css and put it there instead.
[12:33:35] <robertmaxrees> dunno dude
[12:33:45] <robertmaxrees> i have no clue how your stuff is structured.
[12:34:01] <robertmaxrees> avoid fc_slider.css since changing that will make updates a PITA.
[12:34:06] <robertmaxrees> try global.css if you want.
[12:34:45] <Respek> I recommend commenting out a section of CSS that you're adding so you know what you've changed
[12:35:01] <Respek> as in, add a comment above and below saying where you're working
[12:35:02] <SightUp> there is no other code about the slider here
[12:35:15] <robertmaxrees> SightUp that's fine.
[12:35:19] <robertmaxrees> it's your specific styles.
[12:35:35] <robertmaxrees> editing the plugin css will mean that when you later update things, it'll catastrophically break.
[12:36:22] <SightUp> then dont do it in the global? then where?
[12:36:28] <robertmaxrees> wtf
[12:36:34] <robertmaxrees> don't do it in that fc_slider.css file.
[12:36:38] <robertmaxrees> try it in global.
[12:36:53] <SightUp> global.css is still a css
[12:36:57] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[12:36:57] <SightUp> oh the plugin css
[12:36:59] <SightUp> gotcha
[12:36:59] <SightUp> ok
[12:37:06] <doug_> perhaps $('.slider').css({ margin: '0 auto'}) after you init the slider
[12:37:22] <doug_> or before for that matter
[12:37:25] <robertmaxrees> do it in native css imo.
[12:37:38] <doug_> by modifying the plugin??
[12:37:47] <robertmaxrees> by editing your own css file.
[12:37:56] <doug_> ah, and make sure it is after. that would be fine
[12:37:57] <robertmaxrees> why would you edit a plugin's css?
[12:38:22] <doug_> robertmaxrees: because I'm such a moron
[12:38:23] <robertmaxrees> that assumes the plugin is styling this particular element.
[12:38:27] <robertmaxrees> nah, you're not.
[12:38:38] <doug_> I WAS Saying don't edit it :)
[12:38:39] <SightUp> ok can you check to see if i did it right?
[12:38:54] <doug_> kidding though
[12:39:15] <robertmaxrees> SightUp not seeing it.
[12:39:23] <robertmaxrees> did you do it in global.css?
[12:39:27] <SightUp> yes
[12:39:30] <SightUp> at the very bottom
[12:39:35] <robertmaxrees> ...
[12:39:36] <robertmaxrees> dude.
[12:39:43] <robertmaxrees> you're tyring to put javascript in css files.
[12:39:50] <dmsuperman> lol
[12:40:03] <robertmaxrees> you really need to go read a basic tutorial or something.
[12:40:09] <robertmaxrees> .slider { margin: 0 auto; }
[12:40:17] <robertmaxrees> i gave you the exact code you needed a few times.
[12:40:26] <SightUp> but i dont know where to put it
[12:40:30] <SightUp> that is my present issue
[12:40:36] <dmsuperman>  robertmaxrees> did you do it in global.css?
[12:40:38] <robertmaxrees> .slider { margin: 0 auto; } use this instead of what you just did.
[12:41:10] <robertmaxrees> SightUp if you're still confused, you'll need to head over to #web or somewhere else, 'cause this is way OT at this point.
[12:41:29] <SightUp> hense why i get banned from these channels
[12:42:07] <robertmaxrees> you don't have the base, requisite knowledge.  there are other places that can get you started on that path.
[12:42:08] <SightUp> ok i added .slider { margin: 0 auto; } to the global.css file
[12:42:23] <SightUp> dude i have no interest in learning this stuff
[12:42:26] <SightUp> i just want the website to be done
[12:42:33] <robertmaxrees> then you have no business being here lol
[12:42:33] <Respek> you just said earlier you wanted to learn
[12:42:34] <SightUp> i told you this at the very beginning
[12:42:39] <Respek> no
[12:42:43] <Respek> the opposite is true
[12:42:50] <SightUp> to learn how to do what needs to be done on my site
[12:42:51] <SightUp> sure
[12:42:59] <SightUp> but after that, 100% useless to me
[12:43:55] <Respek> I'm recusing myself from this conversation, as I'm probably not going to follow the rules of the channel if I don't
[12:43:56] <robertmaxrees> SightUp then this is the wrong place to go.
[12:44:09] <doug_> SightUp: did you give a link to the site you are making changes to?
[12:44:17] <dmsuperman> I like #hotdogsarebetterwithbbqsauce
[12:44:20] <SightUp> www.particlegaming.com
[12:44:23] <dmsuperman> you should check it out
[12:44:25] <robertmaxrees> we like teachning people how to do things themselves.
[12:44:46] <SightUp> i am trying to do it myself
[12:44:51] <SightUp> that is why i am here
[12:44:51] <robertmaxrees> SightUp so i'd suggest looking for another developer or checking out some place like #web.
[12:45:00] <robertmaxrees> because you're derailing the entire channel at this point.
[12:45:09] <SightUp> so now i am a troll?
[12:45:14] <robertmaxrees> i never said that.
[12:45:16] <SightUp>  great.
[12:45:17] <Respek> with that in mind, could we chat about orienting to a new library w. out a ton of documentation?
[12:45:33] <robertmaxrees> i said you're derailing.  you're probably not intending to.  just letting you know :)
[12:45:41] <robertmaxrees> Respek what about it?
[12:45:42] <dmsuperman> you'd have to tell us which library you mean Respek
[12:46:26] <Respek> specifically https://github.com/Prinzhorn/skrollr I'm trying to debug issues, without handholding, so wanted to have a conversation on tactics or methods you all use when getting used to something
[12:46:57] <robertmaxrees> Respek i'd pop it on a page and try using it.
[12:47:07] <robertmaxrees> poke at what little documentation there is and see what happens.
[12:47:20] <SightUp> well if anyone cares to help, pm me! i will give you ftp info so we can knock it out!
[12:47:47] <robertmaxrees> SightUp not the right place to recruit, either.  check out any of the freenlance channels if that's what you need.
[12:47:49] <Respek> for functions and setting variables I try to output to console.log , in this case, it doesn't seem to be targeting the properties.
[12:48:04] <SightUp> why would i ever offer to pay another one of you people
[12:48:06] <robertmaxrees> Respek not sure what you mean.
[12:48:44] <doug_> SightUp: us people?
[12:48:50] <Respek> doug_:  please don't
[12:48:54] <robertmaxrees> anyway.
[12:49:20] <robertmaxrees> Respek are you just trying to look at the API and see what all is available to you?
[12:49:38] <SightUp> coders. i have hired no less than 4 of you in the past year trying to complete our site and every time you guys take my money without doing the work.
[12:49:44] <Respek> well, when checking scope of a variable, or when seeing if a function is getting to a certain point I can console.log('the variable')
[12:50:11] * Respek exhales
[12:50:31] <robertmaxrees> he got moments away from a ban there.
[12:50:55] <BillCriswell> Damn I wish I missed that.
[12:51:01] <BillCriswell> I wish I was here for that*
[12:51:02] <robertmaxrees> that was... uncomfortable.
[12:51:17] <Respek> but when I'm just supposed to count on a library to work, via adding attributes (like skrollr) and it doesn't work, I don't have much experience in the way of testing out what's going on
[12:51:27] <Respek> yeah, made me a little sad tbh.
[12:51:35] <Respek> nbd though, happy thoughts
[12:51:48] <robertmaxrees> Respek aaaah so the data attributes aren't working?  hrmmmm.
[12:51:53] <BillCriswell> Why would I pay another one of YOU people.
[12:52:26] <robertmaxrees> for perspective - this was all about a gaming clan website.
[12:52:44] <BillCriswell> robertmaxrees: Oh, so serious business.
[12:53:02] <doug_> man this is one of the most welcoming irc rooms I've ever seen
[12:53:08] <robertmaxrees> meh.  some people are terrible clients.  it's all good.
[12:53:09] <doug_> and he got mad
[12:53:17] <robertmaxrees> doug_ kill 'em with kindness :)
[12:53:18] <Respek> doug_: seriously. I was at one point going to offer to tutor them
[12:53:30] <robertmaxrees> we tolerate a lot here because we know that sometimes people are stressed out.
[12:53:44] <robertmaxrees> but once you start lashing out, i've got very little sympathy.
[12:53:44] <Respek> I've gotten so much help, it seemed like the right thing. glad I bit my tongue
[12:53:57] <decx> [21:15:24] <decx> these are pretty basic questions, and css at that. maybe hit up #web *chuckle*
[12:54:03] <hactor> robertmaxrees, man this would've been so beautiful if it didn't have a "but"
[12:54:04] <decx> when i zoned out
[12:56:17] <Respek> robertmaxrees: long story short, I wasn't looking for specific help with skrollr at present, just conceptual stuff about thinking about problems involving jquery (attr specifically). I have console.log in my toolbelt at present.
[12:56:48] <Respek> *(attr in this case)
[12:57:06] <robertmaxrees> so if you're looking at elements on the page, you want .prop() instead of .attr() generally.
[12:57:20] <robertmaxrees> unless it's the value for an input, then you want .val()
[12:57:36] <Respek> !api .prop
[12:57:36] <b-ot> Respek: No matches.
[12:57:43] <Respek> !api prop
[12:57:43] <b-ot> Respek: .prop(): Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[12:57:59] <robertmaxrees> use it the same as .attr(), basically.
[12:58:59] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1ckeh195/1/ shows you why you want .prop()
[12:59:15] <robertmaxrees> or .val()
[12:59:38] <robertmaxrees> also: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Console
[12:59:44] <robertmaxrees> there's a lot more than just .log() for the console.
[12:59:47] <doug_> robertmaxrees: they all say "some text" on FF. is that what you expected?
[13:00:02] <robertmaxrees> doug_ try typing in the input.
[13:00:08] <robertmaxrees> (i use FF too)
[13:00:17] <doug_> ah
[13:00:24] <robertmaxrees> here: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1ckeh195/2/ ;)
[13:01:04] <Respek> here's a little of my logic, but I didn't see you post that, I'll read that now. My goal (while this isn't runnable it shows the jq in questions) is something like this http://jsfiddle.net/b4enev3z/1/
[13:01:29] <robertmaxrees> Respek for data attribures, use .data()
[13:01:40] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:01:47] <Respek> ok, I will research that too :) haha thanks for the link, beat me to it
[13:03:24] <robertmaxrees> though .data() and .prop() might be be appropriate in some cases - it all depends on how the plugin is trying to read values.
[13:04:05] <Respek> I appreciate the granular data a lot. I think it's pretty fascinating how jquery irc resembles oral tradition in some ways
[13:05:08] <robertmaxrees> hahaha - we all had to start somewhere.  there's a LOT of data out there and it's hard to know where to start.
[13:05:15] <robertmaxrees> lots of different ways to write JS and use jQuery.
[13:05:38] <robertmaxrees> takes experience and reading.
[13:05:49] <robertmaxrees> also: http://fixingthesejquery.com/ is a great site.
[13:06:00] <Respek> you people and your reading ;) /sarcasm
[13:06:28] <Respek> "/contextual sarcasm at that"
[13:06:31] <robertmaxrees> weeee
[13:07:51] <Kartagis> is it okay to ask why something is done so at http://try.jquery.com?
[13:07:53] * Respek notches another one for robertmaxrees
[13:08:12] <doug_> Kartagis: yes
[13:08:19] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis sure.
[13:08:28] <rubyonrailed> Whats a good social sharing button plugin?
[13:09:24] <robertmaxrees> rubyonrailed really depends on your needs.
[13:09:49] <rubyonrailed> just simple tiny buttons, that share the link of my page, maybe with some content from my database
[13:10:14] <robertmaxrees> i did a big comparison of some of them a while ago.  let me see if I can't dig up some info.
[13:10:39] <doug_> robertmaxrees: and unfortunately, a lot of wrong information about web development is on the internet too
[13:10:54] <robertmaxrees> doug_ yeah... or inaccurate.  or misguided.
[13:11:19] <Respek> or deprecated
[13:11:37] <decx> rubyonrailed https://github.com/panzi/SocialSharePrivacy
[13:12:58] <robertmaxrees> we compared addthis, addtoany, sharethis, and native ones.  i think we wound up rolling native since we didn't need any of the other features.
[13:13:57] <rubyonrailed> Word haha
[13:13:59] <rubyonrailed> thanks
[13:14:03] <doug_> decx: nice! I can't stand those social sites tracking people either
[13:14:52] <doug_> they aren't looking at the referrer of every request and the IP address of the client out of the goodness of their heart
[13:15:11] <Kartagis> there is <li class="foo" ... <button>BAR</button> <ul class="ticket">... </ul>. why do we do "$(".foo").on('click', 'button', function() { $(this).closest(".foo").find(".ticket"); }); ? can't we do $(this).find(".ticket"); instead?
[13:15:12] <robertmaxrees> nope.  pure profit.
[13:15:26] <robertmaxrees> whaaa.
[13:16:08] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis no.
[13:16:18] <robertmaxrees> not the same, at least.
[13:17:06] <robertmaxrees> $(this).closest(".foo").find(".ticket"); goes up to the nearest parent '.foo', and then finds all child .ticket elements.  depending on the case, there's a good reason for the former.
[13:17:12] <decx> doug_ there was a eu privacy law proposed after which users would have to explicitely consent to sending their data to 3rd parties, it obviously failed because the implications would make the internet useless
[13:17:26] <robertmaxrees> decx++
[13:17:33] <decx> socialshareprivacy was a quick fix by the largest german techsite heise.de
[13:18:46] <codecutter> does it throw an error if a empty its is past to $.each function?
[13:18:51] <dmsuperman> Kartagis: to expand: $(this).find('.ticket') will find all .ticket elements that are children of this, which in this case is a button. The <ul> is not a child of the button, thus that is incorrect
[13:18:58] <dmsuperman> no codecutter it just doesn't run
[13:19:23] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis $(this) is basically the thing the event came from, not the thing you selected.
[13:19:35] <codecutter> i'm getting "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'length' of undefined"
[13:19:43] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ codecutter
[13:19:44] <b-ot> codecutter: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[13:20:40] <dmsuperman> oohhh, I see the confusion now. Didn't notice the selector
[13:25:51] <doug_> Kartagis: .closest goes up the hierarchy. .foo is the parent that it needs to start searching from. $(this).find will only look at children/grandchildren/etc
[13:26:09] <Kartagis> hrm, thanks
[13:26:12] <doug_> Kartagis: and if you are using event delegation, robertmaxrees comment about this applies
[13:28:02] <Kartagis> why does slideDown() not work on jsfiddle?
[13:28:43] <Kartagis> nvm, didn't add event handler
[13:30:57] <Kartagis> cool
[13:35:19] <doug_> Kartagis: for example http://jsfiddle.net/6y87jy3m/
[13:37:45] <Paradisee> help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26243944/how-to-dinamically-load-data-to-a-json-file-in-jquery
[13:41:36] <doug_> Paradisee: does load_json print "An error has occurred" ?
[13:41:50] <Paradisee> doug_: nope
[13:43:22] <doug_> Paradisee: load_json updates the server and the server sends you back what you sent?
[13:43:42] <Paradisee> doug_: it just load the data on a json file on the server
[13:44:23] <doug_> Paradisee: shouldn't that be $(clone).remove() ?
[13:44:42] <Kartagis> can $("#tour").on("click", "button", function() {  be re-written as $("#tour").click("button", function() {  ?
[13:44:44] <doug_> it's the error case though
[13:44:54] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: No.
[13:44:57] <Paradisee> doug_: actually i don't care about the failure, it never happen
[13:45:06] <doug_> Paradisee: famous last words :D
[13:45:13] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: If you're using old jQuery you might need to use .bind().
[13:45:15] <Paradisee> doug_: if it will, ill fix it
[13:45:31] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: Er, delegate() *
[13:45:47] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: instead of .on ?
[13:45:53] <Paradisee> should be: $('#container_map').remove(clone);
[13:46:28] <doug_> Kartagis: why would you though? .on is generally preferred to .click
[13:46:51] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: Yes. Which version of jQuery are you using?
[13:46:56] <Kartagis> doug_: I was told it's a shortcut
[13:47:08] <dmsuperman> it is, but as such has fewer options
[13:47:19] <BillCriswell> doug_: .on wasn't around till 1.7
[13:47:21] <doug_> Kartagis: and it's just a wrapper that calls .on for you
[13:47:30] <Kartagis> BillCriswell: 1.8. I thought  it was .live
[13:47:31] <BillCriswell> That's the only reason I can see not using it.
[13:47:51] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: You shoudl be using on if you're using 1.8
[13:47:58] <dmsuperman> .click(func) is a shortcut to .on('click', func). there's no way to specify a selector with the shortcut
[13:48:04] <dmsuperman> I'm pretty sure he's using on :P
[13:48:04] <Kartagis> so I'm better off using .on
[13:48:10] <BillCriswell> Kartagis: YEs.
[13:48:35] <dmsuperman> I don't see an issue with using both dpeending whether you need the selector or not. slightly more consistent to always use on though, so I do
[13:48:56] <phelix> How could I do something if a specific checkbox in a form becomes unchecked?
[13:49:03] <doug_> imho .click "feels like" it is going to click it. :D
[13:49:23] <decx> 8bytes saved per click(, after a few billion request that's a tree
[13:49:39] <dmsuperman> actually that's the reason I don't care for the shortcuts. they're totally opposite behaviore if you pass nothing
[13:49:42] <dmsuperman> trigger vs bind
[13:49:51] <Paradisee> shoky: you there?
[13:52:00] <doug_> decx: maybe that will save a tree... or maybe using .on everywhere increases gzip compression
[13:52:05] <BillCriswell> decx: Need to think of the trees.
[13:54:15] <decx> now i have the hybrid song from southpark in my head
[13:54:58] <decx> come on everybody be click() people now
[13:55:06] <doug_> decx: anyway, screw the trees. I can believe that bad code can prematurely wear out laptop/phone batteries and cause a relevant effect on the environment. we have an infinite supply of trees, but a finite supply of the elements needed to make batteries
[13:55:17] <doug_> lol
[13:56:16] <decx> wont somebody think of the rare elements!
[13:56:26] <decx> or whatever is in batteries ^^
[13:57:08] <doug_> help a crazy person, conserve the world's lithium so they can take their not-crazy pills :D
[13:59:44] <doug_> Paradisee: I didn't catch what the problem was. what is wrong?
[13:59:58] <Paradisee> doug_: did you see the fiddle?
[14:00:01] <doug_> yes
[14:00:04] <Paradisee> ok..
[14:00:18] <Paradisee> there's a function there, called: add_clone
[14:00:21] <Paradisee> did you see it?
[14:00:32] <doug_> yes
[14:00:55] <Paradisee> when i drag one of the 2 images inside the container, it will add the clone inside it, making it draggable aswell
[14:00:59] <Paradisee> do you get it?
[14:01:19] <doug_> yeah that much works
[14:01:26] <Paradisee> ok fine...now..
[14:01:39] <Paradisee> i want that when i drag and drop the clone inside the container...
[14:01:46] <Paradisee> it has to change the position in the json file
[14:01:49] <Paradisee> like a refresh
[14:02:03] <doug_> which is what the $.ajax is for...
[14:02:34] <Paradisee> exactly, but how can i add the function to make it, when i drop the element elsewhere?
[14:03:08] <doug_> you mean only allow it to drop onto that map thing?
[14:03:19] <Paradisee> the ajax you see there, just add the clone into the json the first time you drag and drop the item
[14:03:25] <Paradisee> yes doug_
[14:03:37] <doug_> that can be fixed using jqui stuff...
[14:03:46] <Paradisee> i don't even know how
[14:04:04] <Paradisee> i'm a python programmer, jquery is quite different
[14:04:52] <Paradisee> doug_: if you can provide an example on jsfiddle would be appreciate
[14:05:21] <Paradisee> like an alert each time the clone is dropped elsewhere
[14:05:37] <Paradisee> and ill try to make my code by myself starting from there
[14:28:09] <doug_> Paradisee: how's this http://jsfiddle.net/hxttz0jx/33/
[14:30:51] <adv_> i have a unix timestamp and i also have timezone info such as 'Europe/London' . how can i adjust the timestamp to the timezone ? is there a plugin?
[14:31:17] <doug_> Paradisee: oops see http://jsfiddle.net/hxttz0jx/34/   in revert: function()... draggingValid is true/false for valid/invalid drop zone
[14:34:14] <doug_> Paradisee: basically what I did was update a flag in dropover/dropout that indicates whether it is in a valid drop zone, then, I configured it to do a callback to ask if it is a valid drop zone (revert), then I simply return whether I got dropover or dropout last
[14:38:39] <doug_> adv_: do you have the GMT +/- offset?
[14:39:08] <adv_> doug_: no, i have only 'Europe/Berlin' for example
[14:42:14] <doug_> adv_: http://momentjs.com/timezone/ is probably what you want
[14:42:31] <adv_> doug_: that's nodejs, i dont want nodejs
[14:42:53] <doug_> adv_: no, it is for browser side too
[14:43:05] <doug_> adv_: that's why it mentions bower
[14:43:19] <doug_> bower is to install for client side, npm is to install for server side
[14:43:57] <doug_> adv_: http://momentjs.com/timezone/docs/#/use-it/browser/
[14:50:25] <adv_> doug_: ah . can it do format("d/m/Y") ?
[14:50:38] <doug_> adv_: http://jsfiddle.net/ww5q8t33/
[14:51:08] <doug_> adv_: http://jsfiddle.net/ww5q8t33/1/
[14:51:40] <doug_> adv_: http://jsfiddle.net/ww5q8t33/3/
[14:53:07] <adv_> doug_: excellent!
[14:56:54] <adv_> doug_: instead of those 2 files i can use only this instead? http://momentjs.com/downloads/moment-timezone-with-data-2010-2020.min.js
[14:58:34] <doug_> adv_: if you only need those years that one is a lot smaller. I think it needs moment.js before it though (according to the docs)
[14:58:51] <doug_> or moment.min.js, you get the idea
[14:59:02] <ThatTreeOverTher> Hey, all. It would really help me if you could fill out this poll about JavaScript Promises for a school project of mine. The question reads: "Do you know how to use Promises?": http://www.easypolls.net/poll.html?p=543461cae4b09149347e28f1
[14:59:08] <adv_> doug_: http://momentjs.com/timezone/
[14:59:14] <doug_> adv_: small bugfixes http://jsfiddle.net/ww5q8t33/6/
[14:59:16] <adv_> that one is the 2nd
[14:59:27] <adv_> i need the 1st as well?
[14:59:56] <doug_> adv_: this says you do: http://momentjs.com/timezone/docs/#/use-it/browser/
[15:00:46] <adv_> ah ok
[15:00:58] <doug_> adv_: fyi, moment is a very popular plugin that helps with date processing (js date manipulation sucks a bit).
[15:01:36] <doug_> because human civilization has made a complete mess of dates and times :D
[15:02:44] <doug_> ThatTreeOverTher: worked
[15:02:55] <doug_> 1 vote, 100% yes
[15:02:57] <adv_> doug_: thanks a lot, will try
[15:03:06] <ThatTreeOverTher> doug_, thanks!
[15:03:42] <doug_> ThatTreeOverTher: and refreshing isn't letting me vote again, which seems right
[15:17:39] <adv_> doug_: can i get the Europe/Berlin part from moment.js somehow?
[15:32:47] <Respek> !api css
[15:32:47] <b-ot> Respek: .css(): Get the value of a style property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/css/
[15:42:22] <Paradisee> doug_: that jsfiddle doesn't resolve my problem
[15:42:40] <Paradisee> it just return the icon on the place, and i don't really need it
[15:42:51] <Paradisee> you probably miss understund my problem
[15:44:38] <adv_> doug_: i have a html field with a date, and i want to trigger convertDates (js function) and override those as soon as they're available. how can i do this?
[15:46:09] <adv_> $('.dateinfo').append(now.tz('Europe/Berlin').format('d/M/YYYY HH:mm:ss'));
[15:46:16] <adv_> i have that but it doesn't seem to work
[15:49:34] <doug_> Paradisee: you want to execute some code when they make a bad drop right?
[15:49:43] <Paradisee> nope doug_
[15:49:48] <Paradisee> anyway i solved it
[15:50:04] <Paradisee> now i have to do other stuff, let's see if im able
[15:50:18] <doug_> adv_: sec
[15:50:57] <arkadio> my $('.selector').toggle(1500) is not working properly the very first time I execute it. Doesnt matter what time in ms or the effect I set, it just runs lightning fast. Does anyone went through problems like this?
[15:51:04] <doug_> Paradisee: what did you mean when you said "like an alert each time the clone is dropped elsewhere"
[15:51:16] <Paradisee> doesn't matter
[15:56:02] <doug_> adv_: http://jsfiddle.net/ww5q8t33/8/
[15:56:26] <tejas-manohar> i have an array var and i want to loop through it and add the each item within a <li><span></span></li> within the overarching <ul class="notification dropdown-menu"></ul>
[15:56:31] <tejas-manohar> look heree for html https://bpaste.net/show/fc8cbde6ef3a
[15:57:42] <adv_> doug_: ah sorry, it's getting generated by php and i want to adjust it as long as it's there
[15:57:46] <adv_> not user input
[15:58:44] <doug_> adv_: as long as it's where? in php?
[16:00:52] <adv_> doug_: no, on the page
[16:01:02] <adv_> doug_: so document.ready i would guess
[16:01:58] <doug_> adv_: how is the data getting into the page now? that code exists?
[16:03:17] <adv_> doug_: yes, the data is getting with an ajax call
[16:03:25] <adv_> getting into the page*
[16:04:33] <adv_> so probably at the .done callback of the ajax
[16:04:38] <adv_> hm!
[16:04:43] <adv_> maybe that's why
[16:05:43] <doug_> adv_: ok in that done handler translate the date accordingly
[16:07:28] <doug_> if you write changes back that might need to be updated to save GMT
[16:07:32] <doug_> too
[16:08:17] <adv_> doug_: hm?
[16:09:33] <doug_> adv_: I'm saying, if you are populating fields for the user to edit it, and you convert it to local time in that .done handler, then you will also have to convert it back (from local to GMT) when you post to save changes
[16:10:09] <Scriptonaut> guys, what's it mean if I have $(document).on('change', '.classname', function() ...
[16:10:11] <doug_> to local berlin time I mean
[16:10:18] <Scriptonaut> the .classname part throws me off, never seen that before
[16:10:34] <doug_> s/local//
[16:10:38] <Paradisee> how can i change some values of a JSON file?
[16:11:42] <Paradisee> done :D
[16:15:41] <Scriptonaut> could someone explain the difference between: $(document).on('click', '.classname', function() {}) and $('.classname').click(function() {})
[16:16:46] <doug_> Scriptonaut: the first one attaches a separate event listener on each thing with the class "classname". the second one attaches one handler that handles every click on the page that came from an element with the class classname
[16:17:06] <doug_> the first one won't work for newly added things, the second one will
[16:17:21] <doug_> the first one uses more memory
[16:17:54] <robertmaxrees> flip that.
[16:17:54] <Scriptonaut> ah, thanks. On a totally different note, I think you explaining that made me realize the cause of a totally different bug in our software (drag and drop image upload)
[16:17:57] <doug_> the second one takes a tiny bit more cpu but overall is more efficient unless you have a crazy number of click events happening (which can't happen realistically)
[16:18:04] <robertmaxrees> the first one is delegated.
[16:18:07] <robertmaxrees> the second isn't.
[16:18:43] <doug_> Scriptonaut: oh crap, reverse what I said
[16:18:45] <doug_> sorry
[16:18:56] <Scriptonaut> oh, so other way around?
[16:18:58] <doug_> yes
[16:19:05] <doug_> first one works for new elements, etc
[16:19:10] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('click', '.classname', function() {}) is delegated, the other is the same as $('.classname').on('click', function() {});
[16:19:25] <Scriptonaut> oh, that makes sense
[16:19:40] <Scriptonaut> > delegated
[16:19:41] <Scriptonaut> what a fancy word
[16:19:55] <doug_> Scriptonaut: you are aware of event bubbling?
[16:20:03] <robertmaxrees> all events bubble, so there's some benefit in attaching fewer listeners in general.  Also a little less overhead so you don't need to hit the dom a bunch to attach new listeners.
[16:20:16] <Scriptonaut> doug_, I don't think so
[16:20:30] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[16:20:47] <doug_> Scriptonaut: when an event happens, it "bubbles up" to each parent until the root element (the document)
[16:21:04] <doug_> Scriptonaut: so when an event happens the event happens for that element and all of its parents
[16:21:24] <adv_> doug_: so almost works but how can i get .dateinfo timestamp instead of moment()?
[16:21:34] <Scriptonaut> ah
[16:21:39] <Scriptonaut> yes, that's my bug
[16:21:41] <Scriptonaut> YES
[16:22:19] <Scriptonaut> basically, if you're on a page where you drag and drop an image to upload, it works fine, but if you open a dialog on the same page that also uploads an image (different way), then you drag and drop, it was firing the event for both of them
[16:22:24] <Scriptonaut> and loading the image twice
[16:22:25] <doug_> Scriptonaut: technically not every event will make it to the root - if someone calls event.stopPropagation()
[16:22:58] <Scriptonaut> thanks
[16:25:56] <adv_> tried var now = $('.dateinfo').text();
[16:26:09] <adv_> didn't work
[16:28:06] <adv_> doug_: dateinfo contains the timestamp
[16:29:09] <doug_> adv_: var now = moment($('.dateinfo').text())
[16:29:11] <doug_> I guess
[16:29:19] <doug_> I'd have to see more code to know for sure
[16:29:30] <adv_> oops
[16:30:42] <doug_> adv_: I am still guessing a lot... is it an input field or text on the page?
[16:30:58] <doug_> adv_: the text on the page is what timezone? it's berlin time? and you want now to be GMT?
[16:30:59] <doug_> or what
[16:31:02] <adv_> sec
[16:31:45] <adv_> <span class="dateinfo" style="visibility:hidden">1412720670</span>
[16:32:19] <adv_> doug_: i get Deprecation warning: moment construction falls back to js Date.
[16:32:37] <adv_> and then after the conversion i get 'invalid date'
[16:33:13] <adv_> the text on the page is unix timestamp
[16:33:22] <adv_> dateinfo that is
[16:33:45] <doug_> adv_: GMT, and you want "now" to be what? berlin time formatted to a string?
[16:34:02] <adv_> yes
[16:35:16] <adv_> when i use var now = moment(); it works . i want to use 'foo' which is the dateinfo time instead of 'now'
[16:35:35] <doug_> adv_:  var now = moment.tz($('.dateinfo').text(), 'Europe/Berlin').format('d/M/YYYY HH:m:s');
[16:35:53] <doug_> oh wait...
[16:36:10] <doug_> that treats the value on the page as berlin... 1 sec
[16:36:41] <doug_> adv_: nevermind, actually that should work
[16:37:27] <adv_> doug_: that still prints out now
[16:38:11] <adv_> Moment Timezone has no data for 1412720670141272066714127206641412720660.
[16:38:48] <adv_> it also says See http://momentjs.com/timezone/docs/#/data-loading/.
[16:38:57] <adv_> so it doesn't like my unix timestamp ?
[16:39:11] <doug_> adv_: what do you mean by unix timestamp? a number?
[16:39:30] <doug_> of seconds since the unix epoch?
[16:39:31] <adv_> 1412720670
[16:39:37] <adv_> yes
[16:39:39] <doug_> k
[16:39:45] <adv_> ah i think it concatenates all !
[16:40:18] <adv_> there are 4 dateinfo spans
[16:40:50] <adv_> yeah it does that
[16:41:11] <adv_> that long number ^ is all 4 timestamps joined by ''
[16:41:50] <doug_> adv_:  var now = moment.tz(+$('.dateinfo').text(), 'Europe/Berlin').format('d/M/YYYY HH:m:s');
[16:41:53] <doug_> note the +
[16:42:42] <adv_> doug_: no
[16:43:01] <adv_> that breaks the page
[16:43:02] <adv_> should i have a foreach or smth ?
[16:43:41] <doug_> there are 4?
[16:43:49] <doug_> what are you going to do with the 4 dates then
[16:44:56] <adv_> doug_: i want to convert all 4 dates with moment
[16:45:53] <adv_> it didn't recognize the timestamp because there were 4 timestamps concatted
[16:46:59] <arkadio> how do I concatenate the "ame" with "t"? http://jsfiddle.net/gbq22ew5/1/
[16:47:00] <doug_> adv_: $('.dateinfo').each(function() { var now = moment.tz(+$(this).text(), 'Europe/Berlin').format('d/M/YYYY HH:m:s'); console.log(now); });
[16:47:23] <adv_> i was just doing that , heh
[16:47:27] <adv_> but what is the + doing?
[16:47:43] <doug_> converts it to a number
[16:49:28] <doug_> js> print(typeof +"12345")
[16:49:32] <b-ot> doug_: number
[16:49:54] <doug_> js> print(+"12345" + 10)
[16:49:57] <b-ot> doug_: 12355
[16:51:19] <doug_> js> print("12345" + 10)
[16:51:22] <b-ot> doug_: 1234510
[16:51:33] <doug_> adv_: ^
[16:53:33] <adv_> doug_: i see. how can i apply it to another span field? like get the timestamp from .dateinfo but apply to .bar
[16:54:12] <adv_> each within an each ?
[16:54:36] <doug_> adv_: it would be much easier if I knew the structure of the page
[16:54:45] <doug_> adv_: how else will I be able to match them up
[16:54:58] <adv_> yeah sorry you're right , going to pastebin
[16:57:46] <adv_> doug_: http://pastebin.com/BAvsvkdS
[16:59:59] <doug_> adv_: $('.dateinfo').each(function() { var elem = $(this), bar = elem.prev('.bar'); bar.text(moment.tz(+$(this).text(), 'Europe/Berlin').format('d/M/YYYY HH:m:s')); });
[17:00:31] <doug_> I think
[17:01:35] <doug_> adv_: gotta go though
[17:01:40] <doug_> will be back on a bit later though
[17:01:43] <adv_>  will try
[17:01:46] <adv_> thanks a lot!
[17:01:52] <doug_> np
[17:13:51] <adv_> didn't work
[17:33:40] <ctcapr> is it possible to kill mouse focus using jquery?
[17:33:40] <ctcapr> for example
[17:33:40] <ctcapr> I have a tile that has a hover pseudo class when I hover over it
[17:33:40] <ctcapr> when I click it, a modal pops up
[17:34:06] <ctcapr> and through the modal backdrop, I can see that the tile still has it's hover effect until I move the mouse a little bit
[17:34:25] <ctcapr> is there anyway I can kill focus or kill hover effect onClick?
[17:35:03] <ctcapr> so that the hover effect is not seen when the modal appears?
[17:35:41] <doug_> adv_: back
[17:36:43] <adv_> doug_: still banging my head on that :(
[17:37:13] <doug_> adv_: will check on fiddle
[17:37:53] <adv_> doug_: didn't work
[17:37:53] <adv_> and my each after each didn't either

[17:50:34] <doug_> adv_: convert seconds to milliseconds
[17:50:58] <doug_> that date is what you expected right?
[17:51:09] <adv_> doug_: ah so moment takes ms where as unix time is secs?
[17:51:12] <adv_> doug_: yes
[17:51:17] <adv_> what kind of sourcery is this!

[17:54:05] <adv_> doug_: excellent, thanks so much
[17:54:17] <doug_> ah, I gave up on firebug a long time ago. the built in one is sufficient. if I need good debugger I use chrome's

[17:54:30] <paulvd> to debug
[17:54:34] <paulvd> but i cannot see main.js

[17:58:31] <doug_> paulvd: yes in the debugger
[17:59:17] <doug_> paulvd: if you do that, the debugger will pause when something bad happens
[18:00:02] <doug_> Horacsio: fadeOut the old one, fadeIn the new one
[18:00:25] <doug_> Horacsio: or use one of the plugins

[18:07:31] <uskerine> hi
[18:07:36] <Nostalg14c> Cork: around?
[18:08:56] <uskerine> I have this css: <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=......" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"> and it is generating a Cross-origin request blocked message. What should be done to avoid this external request?
[18:09:59] <BillCriswell> uskerine: You sure it's coming from that?
[18:10:09] <BillCriswell> If so.. a lot of people would be getting that error.
[18:10:44] <uskerine> No I am not sure, the actual error is this one:    Cross-Origin Request Blocked: The Same Origin Policy disallows reading the remote resource at https://fonts.gstatic.com/s/opensans/v10/MTP_ySUJH_bn..... woff
[18:11:07] <doug_> uskerine: yeah it can't be that stylesheet
[18:11:32] <uskerine> how could I look where is that happening in my code?
[18:11:49] <doug_> uskerine: network tab
[18:11:59] <doug_> uskerine: in browser debugger (probably F12)
[18:12:02] <BillCriswell> It does sound like that's the issue.
[18:12:39] <doug_> uskerine: if it's getting json you can easily work around it
[18:13:00] <uskerine> in network tab I can see that the request is failing, but I have no idea on who is triggering that GET
[18:13:49] <doug_> uskerine: in the sources tab, on the right, scroll down to XHR breakpoints
[18:14:08] <doug_> uskerine: and obviously hit the + and put the address in
[18:14:11] <BillCriswell> uskerine: I can't replicate that.
[18:14:46] <doug_> uskerine: then refresh. it should break into the debugger when it starts that request
[18:15:24] <doug_> uskerine: then on the left pick call stack and click stuff
[18:15:46] <uskerine> doug_ I'll try to do that, I guess you are guiding me as if it would be chrome, right?
[18:16:03] <doug_> uskerine: yes
[18:16:12] <doug_> uskerine: you are using chrome?
[18:16:21] <uskerine> no I am not, I am using Firefox
[18:16:25] <doug_> k... sec
[18:16:29] <uskerine> but there must be the same functionality
[18:17:01] <doug_> uskerine: I don't know how to do an XHR breakpoint there
[18:17:04] <uskerine> the application is working fine even when those request fails, but I have been seeing them for weeks  and I would like to fix them
[18:17:42] <uskerine> I will try to investigate and if I can't find how to set up a breakpoint I will download chrome
[18:18:06] <doug_> uskerine: is it a public website? I can have a quick look
[18:18:14] <Horacsio> http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/co47Lwtg/1/ what am i doing wrong here?
[18:18:26] <uskerine> no it is my development laptop
[18:18:47] <uskerine> thanks for asking anyway doug_
[18:18:50] <hwamokp66> Some of my sections are hidden underneath other sections. It's supposed to just be displayed down the website. http://mobiletest.me/nokia_lumia_920_emulator/#u=http://lansing.hpcreatives.net/
[18:21:11] <doug_> Horacsio: that's the hard way
[18:21:30] <Horacsio> yeah allways the hard way with me :S
[18:21:31] <Horacsio> :)
[18:21:56] <Horacsio> this way I need to test all conditions…
[18:26:25] <Horacsio> doug_ any orientation would be helpfull
[18:29:44] <doug_> Horacsio: 1 sec
[18:29:58] <Horacsio> sure :)
[18:38:29] <doug_> Horacsio: http://jsfiddle.net/co47Lwtg/4/
[18:39:04] <doug_> Horacsio: now you can just add menu item and pages without touching the js
[18:39:40] <Horacsio> wow!
[18:40:02] <Horacsio> but I want to fade it how to add .fadeToggle()?
[18:40:40] <doug_> Horacsio: easy now...

[20:03:44] <z1haze> I've got some form validation scripts on my site, but for some reason, they aren't working in mobile view, any idea why?
[20:39:38] <doug_> z1haze: no way to know without seeing code
[20:44:44] <snufft_> hi guys!
[20:45:06] <snufft_> i'm playing around with ajax events and was wondering if there is a way to tell which element was clicked, in order to fire off the ajax request?
[20:46:15] <z1haze> doug_ ive tracked down the problem, basically im using php foreach loop to spit out a bunch of forms, but only displaying the one they for the link they click on, and the issue is, they all have the same id
[20:46:42] <Zak> snufft_: set a breakpoint for when ajax events occur, then follow the stack trace
[20:46:45] <z1haze> so I need to find a way to give each a unique id in the foreach loop, and somehow do the same thing o nthe validation script
[20:47:35] <Zak> snufft_: there's no concrete reason that ajax requests need to be fired from click events
[20:47:37] <Velveeta> snufft_: you're talking about in a click handler, finding out which element was clicked, so you can fire off an appropriate ajax request?
[20:48:49] <snufft_> Zak, Velveeta, moreso to fire the appropriate ajax completion behaviour :) one button should scroll the page, the other shouldn't do anything, but this should only happen on a successful ajax request
[20:49:25] <Velveeta> well, in any given click even listener, 'this' will tell you which element was clicked
[20:49:47] <Velveeta> or e.target
[20:49:56] <Velveeta> click event* listener
[20:50:31] <snufft_> Velveeta: but if I have $('Form element').ajaxComplete(function........... won't 'this' give me Form Eelement?
[20:50:31] <Zak> snufft_: if you have two different behaviours for different buttons, then I suggest potentially using multipler handlers
[20:51:57] <Zak> snufft_: if you're the one making the ajax request, then I would suggest hooking up the appropriate code to the $.ajax promise
[20:52:02] <Velveeta> as far as i know, ajaxComplete isn't something you bind on a per-element basis
[20:52:03] <dumb_dumb> guys how to get the data attribute from the selector with the enabled state only
[20:52:25] <Zak> Agree with Velveeta. I wouldn't be using ajaxComplete like this.
[20:53:17] <Velveeta> yeah, i'd be using a promise function on the ajax request like zak suggested
[20:53:20] <Zak> ajaxComplete isn't always guaranteed to be called
[20:53:21] <dumb_dumb> i try $(selector).data('id).attr('disabled',''); => not working
[20:53:37] <Velveeta> so if element A kicks off a request to url A, do $.ajax(urlAoptions).done(yourCallback)
[20:53:48] <z1haze> how can i make a jquery form validator function work for a range of form id's?
[20:53:56] <Velveeta> dumb_dumb: try .prop('disabled', false)
[20:53:59] <Zak> dumb_dumb: iirc, you need to do something like attr('disabled', 'disabled')
[20:54:12] <z1haze> like for example anything with a name form4 through form200
[20:54:24] <asidjazz> disabled='disabled'
[20:54:34] <Velveeta> z1haze: you can try $('[id^="form"]')
[20:54:36] <asidjazz> look up the proper disable attribute
[20:54:40] <snufft_> Velveeta, Zak thank you very much :) I'll give it a shot!
[20:54:41] <asidjazz> then .attr accordingly
[20:54:42] <Velveeta> that would be any id that starts with 'form'
[20:55:06] <Velveeta> for the disabled attribute, you should be using .prop vs .attr
[20:55:15] <Velveeta> and you can just pass a boolean to it for the value
[20:55:24] <z1haze> yea i cant do that though
[20:55:46] <Velveeta> then you can't do a range of id's... because that's how it would be done...
[20:56:28] <Velveeta> if you're looking specifically for something that would allow a range of e.g. 4-200 on that id, there's no easy solution
[20:56:58] <tw2113> *fist bumps Velveeta but accidentally finds a hole in the cheese*
[20:56:59] <z1haze> i cant do like regex to allow greater than say.. 4?
[20:57:56] <Velveeta> not with any of the built-in selectors, you'd have to write something custom for that
[20:58:36] <Zak> there's probably a way to construct a regex based on the numbers you might be looking for
[20:58:44] <Velveeta> here's a link to a stackoverflow page on that topic: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/190253/jquery-selector-regular-expressions
[20:59:08] <Zak> worst case scenario, is iterating over a larger group of elements and inspecting the id on each element
[20:59:11] <Zak> not a big deal
[20:59:55] <Zak> i wouldn't spend too much energy on this problem. unless you have A LOT of elements or you're chasing performance on a mobile device, its unlikely to make any difference
[21:00:47] <Velveeta> and any regex selector attribute implemention is gonna do exactly what zak just said, iterate over a larger group of elements and inspect that attribute on each one
[21:01:13] <Velveeta> however, that's all that some of these attribute selectors do already, you'll just want to perftest it for your own uses
[21:10:58] <dumb_dumb> it not working
[21:15:56] <dumb_dumb> http://jsbin.com/bemewapugice/1/edit?html,js,output
[21:38:24] <dumb_dumb> hmmm
[21:38:51] <dumb_dumb> it`s seems every one sleeping now
[21:38:56] <dumb_dumb> :-(
[21:39:47] <Zak> nah
[21:40:21] <Ceterizine> debatable
[21:40:34] <Ceterizine> I'm wrestling with angular ui-sortable
[21:42:31] <Zak> dumb_dumb: did you add the jquery library? looks like it's not there
[21:42:58] <Zak> also, change it to prop('disabled
[21:43:05] <Zak> also, change it to prop('disabled', 'disabled')
[21:43:15] <Zak> i'm not sure what behaviour you wanted, but its disabling it for me
[21:50:41] <asidjazz> isnt prop outdated
[21:50:43] <asidjazz> prop or attr
[21:51:42] <asidjazz> oo http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5874652/prop-vs-attr/5876747#5876747
[22:18:35] <jop008> Anyone an idea how to style selectbox in your own theme?
[22:35:14] <prawnosun> can you have attribute type from text to password and vice versa?
[22:35:31] <prawnosun> can you change attribute type from text to password and vice versa?
[22:41:25] <arschmitz> prawnosun: if you do in IE it will error
[22:41:45] <arschmitz> prawnosun: ie does not allow you to change type other browsers are fine
[22:41:59] <prawnosun> ok
[23:00:30] <doug_> prawnosun: if necessary swap out the whole element
[23:00:46] <prawnosun> doug_: doing that now
