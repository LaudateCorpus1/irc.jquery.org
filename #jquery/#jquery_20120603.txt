[00:16:19] <Whirl3d> sure
[00:16:33] <Whirl3d> aro, use .val();
[00:35:17] <rabbi1> how can i set a flag to true inside a href onclick using validate.js ?
[00:41:03] <ryanaz> I have two buttons in the same <div> area, how do I attach a 'click' to each button ?
[00:42:41] <Whirl3d> ryanaz, there are two easy ways to do it: first is to assign direction $("div button").click(function () {var btn=$(this); //do stuff});
[00:43:22] <Whirl3d> the other is to assign an handler to the parent div like : $('.container').on("click", "div", function () { var item=$(this);, do stuff});
[00:43:29] <Whirl3d> the second method is preferred.
[00:44:07] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, I am afraid your question is too vague...you will need to setup a fsfiddle example to illustrate your question.
[00:44:52] <ryanaz> Whirl3d:   So do you basically have a single button per <div> just with different values ?
[00:45:18] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: i am actually trying to validate a form element and if its true the other Jquery UI tab should show, else return to the previous tab....
[00:45:22] <ryanaz> Whirl3d: I  find it odd I can't just assign an actional to a button with a specific name..
[00:45:30] <rabbi1> alert("Valid: " + $("form").validate().element("#username"); return false; is this correct ?
[00:45:32] <Whirl3d> you can
[00:45:54] <Whirl3d> ryanaz, select the button and apply .click(function () {do stuff});
[00:46:09] <Whirl3d> $("#buttonid").click(function () {do stuff});
[00:46:35] <ryanaz> and I can do :  <button id=buttonid1>Button1</button>  ?
[00:46:49] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: http://49.249.142.215/omms/logon.html
[00:47:16] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, one sec and I'll look. it doesn't look right, but I'll check.
[00:47:42] <Whirl3d> ryanaz, yes, that should work then your selector is $("#buttonid1").click(function() {
[00:49:09] <ryanaz> dang, that's too easy ..... why don't they expain that in the examples??
[00:49:42] <ryanaz>     $( "button", "#agreearea").button(); $( "#button_cancel").click(function() { alert("CANCEL"); }); $( "#button_agree").click(function() { alert("AGREE"); });
[00:49:44] <ryanaz> that' super easy
[00:49:56] <ryanaz> been screwing with it for about 45 minutes.. couldn't connect the dots on how it was supposed to work
[00:50:10] <Whirl3d> ryanaz, they do: http://api.jquery.com/click/
[00:50:54] <ryanaz> if you noticed in the example, the target is to <div> ... not <button>
[00:51:15] <ryanaz> there's not even a single <button> on that page.
[00:52:01] <Whirl3d> <button> is just like any other html element,
[00:52:34] <Whirl3d> it works with any html element. so you could use a.click() or h1.click() or p.click()
[00:53:13] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, I am not familiar with the method signature for .validate and with it minimized in your code, It's impossible to look at
[00:54:03] <Whirl3d> but for the most part, it doesn't seem to make sense to use .validate().element(....
[00:54:05] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: this works good inside the click function "alert("Valid: " + $("form").validate().element("#username")); return false;" now, i should bring the focus back to the previous tab. any idea ?
[00:54:44] <Whirl3d> I'm not seeing any tabs in your example
[00:55:40] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: no issues, i am done with that part, as it is checking for #username , now as it is returning false, i have to get the user back to the "logon" tab (the first tab) as the validation at the first tab was not successfully and clicking second tab should go back to the first tab ......
[00:56:06] <Whirl3d> what tabs?
[00:56:10] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: I have used JQuery UI Tab, may be with only the css loaded it would show....
[00:56:33] <Whirl3d> without it, your question doesn't make a lot of sense 8(
[00:57:46] <Whirl3d> your css is loading, but your never call the tab() function
[00:58:47] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: http://imagebin.org/214942
[00:59:08] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: oops sorry, thats external ..... will replace it
[01:00:08] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: you can have a look at it now, i am really sorry
[01:00:15] <ryanaz> I have this in my html:    <input type="checkbox" id="agree_box">   Whether or not the box is checked I get "on" when I do :   alert($('#agree_box'.val())
[01:00:20] <Whirl3d> np. lemme check
[01:01:53] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, now I see the tabs. The problem, however, is that I am not sure what you are validating in the username?
[01:02:19] <ryanaz> figured it out        alert($('#agree_box').attr('checked'));
[01:02:41] <Whirl3d> If they click "forgot password" it doesn't active the forgot password tab. But I can manually activate it. then what?
[01:02:55] <jita> Whats the best audio format which is supported among all browsers? I am currently using wav file, i am only having issues in IE9, where wav is not supported by html5 or flash. Any recommendations ?
[01:03:22] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: doesn't matter, as i am ok with the validation part, i just want to know, how can i get (focus) to the previous tab, without window reload .....
[01:04:22] <Whirl3d> show()
[01:04:31] <Whirl3d> $(".previoustab").show();
[01:05:51] <Whirl3d> jita, sorry I cannot help you. I have never done audio on the web.
[01:06:02] <jita> Whirl3d: no problem
[01:07:01] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: can't use the id or class or name of previous tab, in this case that's fine, but if there a 'n' number tabs and how to get the previous tab ?
[01:07:58] <rabbi1> jita: not an expert advice, did you consider using .mp3/4 or .ogg ?
[01:08:49] <rabbi1> jita: generally, wav for audio consumes your memory
[01:08:57] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, I just realized that you need to look at the api for tabs to find that information. Which is all that I am doing, but your could be doing yourself. LOL
[01:09:12] <Whirl3d> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/
[01:09:13] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: :) thanks :)
[01:09:19] <Whirl3d> np.
[01:09:24] <rabbi1> i am until here with that it self .....
[01:09:29] <rabbi1> lol
[01:10:00] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: i would be doing it simultaneously , google, jquery API and IRC ;)
[01:10:02] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, check out 3.3 or 3.1 to get index information
[01:10:24] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: sure bro ...
[01:11:00] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: it will be something like .index - 1
[01:11:30] <Whirl3d> var selected = $tabs.tabs('option', 'selected'); should give you the current index. substract one and ask for tabs('select', selected-1);
[01:11:33] <Whirl3d> ?
[01:14:45] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: checking it out .... brb
[01:19:55] <rabbi1> var curTab = $tabs.tabs('option', 'selected'); alert("Selected:" + curTab );  this should give me the selected tab right ? but it's not
[01:20:31] <Whirl3d> first of all, don't use alert. it's terrible
[01:20:37] <Whirl3d> use console.log(curTab);
[01:20:37] <ryanaz> can anyone tell me why this dialog box is blowing up ?   https://beta.stratfuel.com/main.cgi?page=fbo_register_agreement
[01:21:07] <Whirl3d> then you can see what you are getting back from the tabs function. And double check the syntax. I don't think it's $tabs
[01:21:46] <Whirl3d> ryanaz, what does "blowing up" mean?
[01:21:59] <ryanaz> it's like really tall... suppopsed to just be normal sized
[01:22:04] <ryanaz> i've tried setting height and it's not working
[01:24:03] <ryanaz> Whirl3d: fixed it .... I was 'floating left' all my other divs.. aparently this doesn't like that
[01:26:38] <Whirl3d> lol, I was searching through the css. would've never got that. LOL
[01:32:17] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: can u help me, how to get to previous tab (redirecting) without a window. reload ?
[01:34:12] <Whirl3d> did you look in console.
[01:34:28] <Whirl3d> what did it return when you typed console.log(curTab)?
[01:37:18] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: it returned [div#tabs.ui-tabs] under it 0. context etc. etc
[01:37:40] <Whirl3d> then there is no previous tab
[01:37:44] <Whirl3d> if it's id=0;
[01:37:49] <Whirl3d> that's the first tab.
[01:37:54] <Whirl3d> no tabs before it
[01:38:04] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: yeah, that could be coz i am calling the onclick function of second tab
[01:38:38] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, why are you doing that if second tab is not active?
[01:38:50] <rabbi1> it should actually return 1
[01:39:04] <Whirl3d> if the second tab is active
[01:39:05] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: it is active.....
[01:39:34] <batdorf> can you use a conditional statement within jquery animate() ?
[01:39:55] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, I am getting an error in your additionalMethods.min.js script
[01:40:12] <Whirl3d> batdorf, can you provide an example?
[01:40:19] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: yeah, that's ok, i don need that .js
[01:40:33] <Whirl3d> well, your script isn't going to work with errors
[01:40:37] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: i got it , i was using the curTab outside the click..... :(
[01:41:00] <rabbi1> removed it ... 1
[01:45:40] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: yeah, finally http://paste.ubuntu.com/1020952/
[01:45:59] <batdorf> I want to animate the height and margin of an element, but only the height on a specific condition
[01:46:32] <Whirl3d> then you need to select for the condition and apply animate with the correct properties.
[01:46:38] <rabbi1> sorry, prefinally....... now, could you please help me on how to add conditional statement
[01:46:46] <batdorf> i'll need two animate functions?
[01:47:00] <Whirl3d> or two sets of properties
[01:47:46] <batdorf> can i use an array object with the animate function?
[01:47:56] <Whirl3d> I always divide my animate function inito animate(css, action)    where css is an object literal that contains the properties and values to animate to. then action contains, easing, complete callback, duration, step and queue
[01:48:09] <Whirl3d> meaning?
[01:48:43] <batdorf> maybe im thinking object literal? I don't know all the terminology very well
[01:49:00] <Whirl3d> object literal is like {opacity:0, display:"none'}
[01:49:15] <batdorf> yeah i meant that
[01:49:19] <Whirl3d> sure
[01:49:37] <batdorf> i think i need the easing, etc to be different for two of the properties as well
[01:49:49] <Whirl3d> action is the same thing above {duration:500, ease:"easeOutBack", queue:false, complete:callback};
[01:49:59] <Whirl3d> that's trickier
[01:50:11] <Whirl3d> you'll have to lookup the alternate syntax
[01:50:58] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: is this correct to get previous tab $tabs.tabs('select, curTab-1) ?
[01:51:22] <batdorf> i'll try a few things out, thanks for the help
[01:51:23] <Whirl3d> I think it's something like {opacity:[0,"easeOutExpo"], left:[300, "easeOutBack"]}
[01:51:28] <Whirl3d> np
[01:51:34] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, are you for real>
[01:51:43] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: why sir ?
[01:52:51] <batdorf> another question, is there a way to call a function only after both animate functions finish?
[01:53:11] <Whirl3d> batdorf, that's even trickier...but yes
[01:53:18] <Whirl3d> lookup .when()
[01:53:48] <batdorf> ok
[01:54:16] <Whirl3d> You'll need to create a custom animation function that returns a deferred object and then you can use .when()...or the old way is to set a function that checks a register. If the register is true for both (or all) animations, then continue
[01:55:26] <Whirl3d> function allComplete() {if (slide1.css("opacity")==1 && slide2.css("opacity")==1} {do this; return; } return;}
[01:56:23] <rabbi1> final and very simple UITab and Validation code http://paste.ubuntu.com/1020960/  have a nice time
[01:56:26] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7587311/jquery-ui-tabs-next-and-previous-buttons
[01:56:45] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: thanks a lot for your support :) have a great day, have fun ... !
[01:58:32] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: please say that you are not fed up
[01:58:49] <Whirl3d> rabbi1, never...8)
[01:59:04] <Whirl3d> I mean never fed up. LOL
[01:59:23] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: did u have a look at the code, it's premature, but will work on that and make it better later once i get time .....
[02:00:09] <Whirl3d> No, so long as you got it working, I was gonna try to finish my work. LOL
[02:02:50] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: lol
[02:04:36] <rabbi1> got high temperature, had tabs (because of jquery tabs) lol... will get sleep for some time. thanks once again Whirl3d, you were very helpful
[02:06:01] <Whirl3d> np. gnite
[02:07:53] <rabbi1> Whirl3d: thanks but i am in +5:30
[02:21:28] <diverdude> If i select an element like this: $("#current-message-modal .reciever-placeholder"), should that not return all elements implementing the reciever-placeholder class, which are nested in the element with id current-message-modal ?
[02:22:52] <Whirl3d> diverdude, yes, but the "-" s might cause problems.
[02:23:06] <Whirl3d> jquery prefers the use of camelCase
[02:23:26] <Whirl3d> but I can't say that that's the problem for sure. I'd have to see some code to help
[02:23:33] <diverdude> yeah ok
[02:26:50] <Haprog> It's a quite common practise to have CSS classes with "-" and it will not have a problem in jQuery.
[02:27:49] <Whirl3d> I've had problems with it so i'm sure it's just me.
[02:27:50] <Haprog> diverdude: That should return a jQuery collection with all those elements. Not an array of plain DOM nodes if that's what you mean.
[02:28:21] <Haprog> With JS variables having "-" might be problematic, I'm not sure. But shouldd be ok in CSS.
[02:28:55] <Haprog> diverdude: but "recieve" should be spelled "receive"
[02:29:00] <Haprog> make sure you don't have typos.
[02:29:03] <Haprog> *btw
[02:29:15] <diverdude> yes
[02:29:21] <diverdude> thx
[02:31:51] <Axcy> Hello, can anyone see what's wrong with this line - I get a syntax error on it: -> $(spanName).append('<img src="'path+rPictureNo[i]'" />');
[02:32:34] <Haprog> Axcy: is spanName a string variable? and you're missing some concatenation operators (+)
[02:33:35] <Haprog> Should probably be $('span[name=spanName]').append('<img src="'+path+rPictureNo[i]+'" />');
[02:34:08] <Haprog> or just spanName in the beginning if it is actually a string variable containing a proper selector. or if it is a DOM node.
[02:35:05] <Axcy> Haprog: Yes it's a string name, was unsure if I could write $('rpictures'+i)
[02:35:48] <Haprog> you can but make sure it's a proper selector. if you select by name you need the attribute selector as I showed. or if by id you need $('#id'), and by class $('.class')
[02:36:34] <Haprog> if you just do $('something') it will try to search for an elemen with tag <something>
[02:36:40] <Haprog> *element
[02:40:25] <diverdude> how do you guys usualy organize your js? I mean...usually some js code is specific for a certain view/page. Do you then have a js file per page and then some common js or how do you guys usuay do?
[02:40:47] <Axcy> Haprog: http://jsfiddle.net/3cPtF/ - That's my complete script
[02:41:06] <Axcy> Seems I'm doing something wrong in terms of the selector of the element
[02:44:03] <Axcy> Correction, selector is fine - It's the image array images I'm messing up :)
[02:44:22] <Haprog> you can't do rPictureNo[i] since it's not an array
[02:44:34] <Haprog> you probably want newMiniImg[i] there?
[02:45:03] <Haprog> I mean.. newMiniImg[rPictureNo] ?
[02:46:04] <Haprog> but you should use a full working http path there to be able to test the images in jsfiddle
[02:46:39] <Axcy> Haprog: Doh, I blame it on being sunday :) - Thanks
[02:47:02] <diverdude> phidev: anyone?
[02:47:10] <Haprog> and also probably on here: newMiniImg.splice(newMiniImg.indexOf(i), 1); also use rPictureNo instead of i?
[02:48:20] <Axcy> Haprog: Idd :)
[02:49:35] <Axcy> Haprog: But seems I'm doing something wrong, I'm trying to remove pictures I've already used once from the array(So I don't have the same pictures) - But it seems they don't get removed from the array
[03:07:55] <duellsy> hey all
[03:07:57] <Stava> I have a simple array with URLs which i'd like to bind to each row of a table, as if the rows were links. I've got it working, but I'd like to ask you if this is an efficient and correct way to do it? http://pastebin.com/UEJh1V5t

[03:18:07] <Luffha> guys, how do i select each ID inside a specific class?
[03:20:30] <Luffha> ok found it $(".container").children("div").click(function(e)
[03:47:21] <Whirl3d> $(".class ['id']") ?
[03:47:49] <ravenzz> why appendTo appends only foo instead of the LI wrapped one? http://jsfiddle.net/VZSEc/
[03:49:19] <Whirl3d> when you wrap an element, it keeps the element selected, rather than reselecting the wrapper
[03:49:59] <Whirl3d> foo.wrap("<li/>").parent().appendTo("$("ul')) might work.
[03:50:21] <Whirl3d> http://jsfiddle.net/VZSEc/1/
[03:50:24] <ravenzz> that make sense

[04:02:58] <Whirl3d> I would like to make a dynamic "dims" object that at any time, I could ask for any dimension property of the object's target  element and it would return that property even if it had to calculate it. In other words, if I wanted the center position x value for itema, I could ask dimsa.pos_centerx() and it would return (itema.position().left+.5*itema.width);  any ideas on how to do this?
[04:03:42] <tdskate> looking for some advice on what would be the ideal timestamp format in a json service,

[07:33:09] <shoky> Whirl3d: what's the issue with doing that?
[07:33:59] <starsinmypockets> Oy
[07:34:23] <starsinmypockets> I need to pass a variable to an ajax function only if a data attribute is defined...

[07:35:17] <starsinmypockets> Any idea how to accomplish this?
[07:39:13] <shoky> what's the problem?
[07:39:42] <shoky> starsinmypockets:  you can check if i is undefined..
[07:40:10] <shoky> or with hasAttr
[07:40:23] <shoky> ok no hasAttr
[07:40:59] <Whirl3d> Good morning shoky, what's up?
[07:41:20] <shoky> morning. nothing much up. sups?
[07:41:38] <alex12> have a small pickle of a problem - posted here http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10869750/jquery-tools-load-external-content-into-overlay-with-custom-variable-googl  ... trying to pull in a variable property_id that ive set into a onbeforeload() - and im stuck - can anyone take a sniff?
[07:41:49] <shoky> alex12: any difference if you put 'var' before  property_id = market.get('id')  ?
[07:44:04] <alex12> shoky- ill try what now
[07:44:08] <alex12> that*
[07:45:21] <shoky> marker*
[07:46:58] <alex12> shoky: nope :( - still the previous markersid
[07:47:26] <alex12> everything outside / around the overlay() sees the update, just not the overlay() itself
[07:47:43] <alex12> is there a way i can pull the variable into overlay() somehow?
[07:47:48] <shoky> you sure you're supposed to call .overlay again each time with the mask & onBeforeLoad ?
[07:49:15] <alex12> come again?
[07:50:07] <alex12> $("#contentWrapBeta").overlay({ .... }); defines the overlay, then its called with $("#contentWrapBeta").overlay().load();
[07:50:12] <shoky> it just seems like you're re-initializing that overlay element
[07:50:18] <shoky> and maybe you're not supposed to do it like that, i dunno
[07:50:38] <alex12> well, i have to reinitalize, because the id needs to update when i perform the wrap.load()
[07:51:11] <alex12> hence my problem i think, i initialise it, it "saves" the property_id , and doesnt reinitialise afterwards
[07:51:21] <alex12> therefor the property_id doesnt get pulled in
[07:51:47] <coldhead> so don't initialise with the wrong ID in the first place?
[07:51:50] <coldhead> case closed?
[07:52:00] <alex12> coldhead: no, first marker it pulls, works fine
[07:52:20] <alex12> coldhead: second marker it clicks, or any subsequent, its always the first markers property_id
[07:52:52] <starsinmypockets> I want to click function to an element that is created via ajax (ie - not present on page load)
[07:53:31] <shoky> ?on @ starsinmypockets
[07:53:31] <bot-t> starsinmypockets, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[07:53:58] <coldhead> alex12: perhaps you need a unique #contentWrapBeta for each instance >: \
[07:54:09] <coldhead> as in not the same ID reused
[07:54:16] <scar> is there a better way in jquery to call a function when a particular radio button is selected-- and that function just makes another div appear?
[07:54:32] <scar> changing style to display:none; when deselected
[07:54:33] <alex12> coldhead: with over 100 markers per display, thats alot of .... blood and guts
[07:54:42] <coldhead> blame whoever wrote overlay()
[07:55:02] <alex12> coldhead: maybe i could reference them with some sort of array? somehow tie it into the markers array?
[07:56:31] <shoky> alex12: i'd try :   $('#contentWrapBeta').data('property_id', property_id).overlay(
[07:56:33] <shoky> oops
[07:57:15] <scar> looks like i found a good example much easier than standard js
[07:57:20] * alex12 tries
[07:57:21] <coldhead> $('#contentWrapBeta').remove(); // and then insert a new one
[07:57:41] <shoky> alex12: i'd try :   $('#contentWrapBeta').data('property_id', property_id).overlay({ mask/effect/..., onBeforeLoad: function() { var propId = $('#contentWrapBeta').data('property_id'); ... }})
[07:57:56] <shoky> or what coldhead suggests
[07:58:05] * alex12 will try both : )
[07:58:07] <alex12> gimme 5
[07:58:37] <alex12> coldhead: ill do that on a onclose: function {} etc
[07:58:52] <alex12> inside the overlay, see if that works
[07:59:02] <coldhead> you have good instincts, alex12
[07:59:05] <coldhead> good work
[08:00:31] <starsinmypockets> shoky - in my case I did the binding in the ajax success function
[08:00:39] <starsinmypockets> Not sure if this is best practice but works
[08:01:10] <shoky> starsinmypockets: that's one way
[08:01:45] <alex12> coldhead: doing that seems to break it, after a close, the overlay doesnt work anymore
[08:02:07] <alex12> coldhead: as in, you click a marker, and nothing happens - which i guess cause im removing it
[08:02:28] <alex12> coldhead: it works for the first marker, then the close function removes the overlay
[08:02:42] <alex12> coldhead: and then doesnt fire for subsequent markers clicked
[08:02:50] <coldhead> oh i see what you're saying
[08:02:53] <alex12> from what i can tell
[08:02:54] <alex12> yeah
[08:02:57] <coldhead> you want them all to be able to work at once
[08:03:12] <alex12> yeah, so each marker has an independent overlay
[08:03:15] <coldhead> i'd go back to the unique overlay for each then
[08:03:16] <alex12> i think
[08:03:23] <coldhead> it's gross but it will work
[08:03:27] <coldhead> and you can get on with your life
[08:03:37] <alex12> haha, i cant get around in my head how to achieve that
[08:03:39] <coldhead> there are worse problems in the world than too many dics
[08:03:43] <coldhead> divs*
[08:03:46] <coldhead> lol dics >: |
[08:03:50] <alex12> haha
[08:04:01] <alex12> well, my little issue with that is
[08:04:10] <shoky> not enough vagoos
[08:04:12] <alex12> matching divs to markers
[08:04:18] <alex12> and all that juice
[08:04:29] <cwr> hi
[08:04:29] <shoky> vag juice?
[08:04:41] <alex12> yes, itll be smelly
[08:04:44] <coldhead> >: |
[08:04:52] <shoky> hmm juice
[08:04:54] <scar> http://jsfiddle.net/k23Q9/ why won't the Guaranteed Options show the #guaranteed-opt div?
[08:05:21] <shoky> scar: using @ for attributes is ooooooooooold
[08:05:34] <alex12> yeah so, in the multi div overlay approach, think it through with me :
[08:05:53] <scar> shoky: i just looked at an example online :(
[08:05:54] <alex12> i get the number of markers there are, append a ton of div's to the end of the html with id as marker id
[08:06:01] <alex12> then spam out overlays for each?
[08:06:19] <alex12> somehow it has to be dynamic to match marker[id] with overlay - id's ?
[08:06:21] <scar> shoky: how should i do it then, so i can say if the value equals when selected
[08:06:24] <shoky> scar: dont look at examples , look at the docs
[08:06:26] <alex12> i get totally lost...
[08:06:30] <shoky> scar: and examples in the docs
[08:06:40] * alex12 tried shokys idea
[08:06:46] * alex12 tries *
[08:07:15] <shoky> alex12: if you put that shit in a jsfiddle , we'll fiddle ;P
[08:07:35] <cwr> i use this function for an image $("#weiserI").mouseout(function(){...} but inside this image is an image map and the event does also trigger when the cursor enters an area of the image map. can I tell jQuery not to execute the function when in the image map? The image map can be accessed by $('map[name=ImageMap]')
[08:08:01] <starsinmypockets> Hmm... trying to add an iterator to this ajax call to iterate the shift number in some form elements when they're added via ajax.... the second console.log(myUrl) shows the updated variable, but this isn't subsequently being passed to my PHP function...
[08:08:11] <starsinmypockets> http://pastebin.com/u73yuymm
[08:08:27] <starsinmypockets> Is there a better way to accomplish this? I'm a little stumped
[08:09:16] <shoky> scar: you dont have any radio buttons with name=location ...
[08:09:49] <alex12> shoky: i think you have a winner
[08:09:53] <alex12> shoky: verifying
[08:10:04] * alex12 verifies
[08:10:06] <coldhead> alex12: http://jsfiddle.net/jZNbV/
[08:10:14] <coldhead> that's just a rough idea of how you could do it
[08:10:44] <alex12> coldhead: thanks - i think shoky is onto something, gimme 5, just cleaning up the rest of the code
[08:11:27] <shoky> im onto you, coldhead !
[08:11:44] <coldhead> oh god, you mean you know i don't really know jQuery?
[08:11:47] <coldhead> TELL NO ONE
[08:12:02] <shoky> i saw you and jQuery doing the naughty
[08:12:11] <alex12> shoky wins!
[08:12:18] <shoky> ;P
[08:12:26] <alex12> yeap, data() nailed it
[08:12:46] <alex12> ill update my stackoverflow with the fix, unless you want to take the creds shoky :)
[08:12:59] <shoky> nah i dont care bout that ;P
[08:13:04] <shoky> i'm happy with my 45 creds
[08:13:11] <alex12> cool, many many thanks coldhead and shoky
[08:13:20] <shoky> np
[08:13:32] <coldhead> very nice work, fellas
[08:13:33] <alex12> onwards towards the next problems : )
[08:15:45] <shoky> cwr:  i think you want mouseenter/mouseleave and not mouseover/mouseout
[08:15:59] <shoky> cwr: check out http://api.jquery.com/mouseover/   especially the last demo
[08:21:56] <cwr> shoky: I see thanks. but the image map is not a child of the div where the image is defined. so this is not working. Maybe I have to check the position of the mouse cursor or something like that
[08:26:43] <jexmex> is there a jquery plugin for auto resizing elements based on the size of the window?
[08:27:08] <jexmex> basically what grooveshark does
[08:28:14] <coldhead> use percentages in your CSS
[08:28:19] <coldhead> bam
[08:29:39] <jexmex> I think you run into issues with percentages...look at http://grooveshark.com code watch it as you resize your browser window (look at the inline style tags for the man content elements)
[08:29:44] <jexmex> *main
[08:43:45] <jexmex> going to dive into developing a jquery plugin wish me luck
[08:44:40] <shoky> gl
[08:50:34] <jexmex> http://layout.jquery-dev.net/
[08:50:39] <jexmex> guess I dont need to write a plugin
[08:51:00] <shoky> o.o
[08:52:02] <jexmex> whats that for?
[08:52:03] <jexmex> lol
[08:52:22] <jexmex> I need a "I have no idea what I am doing" meme right about now
[08:52:40] <Whirl3d> welcome to my life...lol
[08:52:45] <jexmex> lol
[08:52:54] <jonocosa__> lol
[08:53:01] <jexmex> atleast I am in good company
[08:53:29] <Whirl3d> likewise. Now what do we do?
[08:54:49] <jexmex> I am going to read these docs, create a test interface and see how it goes
[08:56:19] <Whirl3d> me too. Wanna race ? Just kidding. I have no idea what I'm even talking about any more...
[08:57:52] <jexmex> shit its sunday, after a bit of play around with this I am going to crack open a beer
[08:57:59] <jexmex> and relax
[09:57:37] <Zerpex> Hi, I'm having this code: http://pastebin.com/jmKJDsY8 - problem is, that it doesn't slide :/ it just appears.
[10:09:17] <Super> is the plugin archive site down for anyone else?
[10:09:51] <Whirl3d> yes, it's been down for a while.
[10:10:07] <Whirl3d> They are dilligently working on revamping it.
[10:11:31] <PIKER32> question about setting up a plugin
[10:11:33] <PIKER32> http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Plugin_Methods
[10:11:49] <PIKER32> ^referring to that point in the documentation
[10:12:41] <PIKER32> not sure of the arrangement of   $.fn.tooltip = function( method )  for setting up methods for a plugin
[10:12:53] <PIKER32> since its signature matches   $.fn.tooltip = function( options )
[10:13:24] <Whirl3d> one of the ways the plugin exposes its functions is by passing a method as an argument.
[10:13:40] <PIKER32> that part im with you on
[10:13:51] <Whirl3d> you first check to see if a method is passed as an argument, if so, call the method. If not initialize the plugin with the options
[10:14:11] <PIKER32> ah ok so its all rolled into the same function?
[10:14:35] <Whirl3d> yes. plus you can get the reference to it by not passing anything
[10:14:57] <Whirl3d> so it's three, three, three functions in one curry-flavored wrapper...
[10:16:01] <PIKER32> haha yup that did it, just wanted to make sure i was headed down the right path
[10:16:25] <PIKER32> thanks
[10:16:28] <Whirl3d> np

[10:34:54] <ZeroBeholder> there are others, that is the one I go to first.
[10:42:29] <shoky> ZeroBeholder: what's the issue exactly
[11:02:26] <brianpWins> will undelegate() in bind all the event of elements within the selector you pass it?
[11:13:41] <shoky> excuse me ?
[11:14:07] <shoky> @ brianpWins
[11:14:17] <brianpWins> heh sorry
[11:14:32] <brianpWins> I have an element with many event binder to it and elements within it
[11:14:58] <brianpWins> if I run undelegate() on the parent element. I'm wondering if it also undelegates to all children elements
[11:15:29] <brianpWins> which i think it did successfully. that or the elements were all binded to the parent (as they should have been)
[11:16:28] <shoky> what did your .delegate call look like
[11:17:18] <shoky> undelegate will only remove a handler from the parent..
[11:17:28] <shoky> a handler for events on the children
[11:17:51] <brianpWins> shoky: don't know. It was generated JS from somewhere else. but i do believe its working like expected so I'll assume the delegation was written properly
[11:18:00] <shoky> and by removing that handler, the delegation is no more
[11:18:21] <shoky> there's nothing recursive going on if that's what you mean
[11:22:51] <brianpWins> shoky yeah. despite the fact I can't articulate it. We're on the same page =)

[12:47:21] <PIKER32> question on writing a plugin and making settings accessible inside the namespace
[12:47:39] <PIKER32> settings being the initial setup parameters
[12:48:32] <PIKER32> is there a settings variable already existing inside the jQuery library or do I need to setup my own global var?
[12:49:08] <shoky> make your own
[12:50:56] <PIKER32> a simple var? trying to encapsulate everything as best i can
[12:51:12] <shoky> as simple as you want it to be, yes
[12:51:16] <johnkpaul> PIKER32: how are you making your plugin? you can setup default options wherever you want

[12:51:31] <shoky> just remember... there's no such thing as a jquery plugin. it's just a function like any other

[14:06:10] <wthpr0> Is it possible to hook the <a> event to do an ajax fetch instead of a page update ?
[14:06:36] <systemfault> Sure
[14:06:56] <wthpr0> how ?
[14:07:12] <systemfault> $('a').on('click', function(event){ event.preventDefault(); dosomethingajaxyhere(); });
[14:07:50] <gdoron> Hi
[14:07:55] <bobbytek2> It seems as though expanding a div at the bottom of the page will scroll the viewport up in FF
[14:08:06] <bobbytek2> How can I avaoid that?
[14:08:15] <bobbytek2> It takes the user out of context
[14:08:47] <shoky> cybuch: objective-c
[14:08:52] <gdoron> How can I query the DOM and get a jQuery object with the elements ordered in the selector order?
[14:09:18] <johnkpaul> gdoron: "ordered in the selector order"?
[14:09:21] <gdoron> For example: $('#div3, #div1, #div2').foo
[14:09:57] <johnkpaul> gdoron: have you tried that?
[14:10:05] <gdoron> $x[0].id== "div3", $x[1].id == div1
[14:10:16] <gdoron> I feel like in Stack  Overflow... :)
[14:10:41] <gdoron> I tried with "add" but it doesn't work with jQuery > 1.4
[14:11:00] <wthpr0> systemfault: i get an error saying "Object [object Object] has no method 'On' ". i tried with $('a').click(function(event){ event.preventDefault(); doingsomething()}); instead but no joy :(
[14:11:41] <gdoron> @john, Do you know how can it be done?
[14:12:00] <systemfault> wthpr0: It's .on and not .On
[14:12:16] <johnkpaul> gdoron: for what purpose do you need the order?
[14:12:53] <wthpr0> systemfault: i've tried both, same thing.
[14:13:00] <gdoron> I'll give you a jsfiddle, one moment.
[14:13:04] <systemfault> wthpr0: What is your version of jquery?
[14:13:24] <wthpr0> systemfault: 1.6.4
[14:13:32] <gdoron> http://jsfiddle.net/RwMy7/12/
[14:13:33] <systemfault> wthpr0: That's why
[14:13:38] <systemfault> wthpr0: .on is in 1.7
[14:13:50] <gdoron> use "delegate" instead
[14:14:33] <cybuch> shoky: have you written something that u can show off?
[14:14:47] <shoky> cybuch: for iphone? no
[14:14:56] <shoky> im just starting out
[14:15:35] <gdoron> johnkpaul, Well... What do you think?
[14:15:57] <johnkpaul> gdoron: http://jsfiddle.net/RwMy7/13/
[14:16:11] <wthpr0> systemfault: thanks, after an update it worked :)
[14:16:25] <systemfault> wthpr0: Wonderful :D
[14:17:13] <gdoron> Thanks, but I'm interest in a "cleaner" way,  though I'm not sure there is one.
[14:17:21] <cybuch> shoky: and in general?
[14:17:37] <johnkpaul> gdoron: what do you find unclean about that?
[14:17:50] <johnkpaul> jquery makes no order guarantee with it's selectors AFAIK
[14:18:56] <gdoron> That I can't use one selector, I have to use jQuery object equals to the elements number.
[14:19:28] <gdoron> I'm not saying you're wrong, or there even a better way, but I'm not pleased with this way. :(
[14:20:09] <gdoron> I think jQuery should have given us a way to select the elements in the selector order...
[14:20:10] <systemfault> gdoron: If all the "nodes" you need to animate are in the same container, you could just forget about your IDs
[14:20:38] <gdoron> But I want them one after the other, and not in the order of the DOM.
[14:20:57] <gdoron> but since jQuery 1.4, this is how things are done.
[14:22:17] <gdoron> Thoughts?
[14:22:47] <systemfault> Order of the DOM is usually what you want :'(
[14:22:47] <shoky> javascript has a perfectly suitable structure for ordering elements
[14:23:15] <gdoron> Not always...
[14:23:32] <danheberden> gdoron while jQuery could do this for you, it's using qSA which doesn't follow this
[14:23:34] <gdoron> Usually yes, not always.
[14:23:40] <danheberden> you're asking for something against spec
[14:23:50] <danheberden> thus, you need to select them in the order you want
[14:24:00] <gdoron> qSA?
[14:24:08] <systemfault> document.querySelectorAll
[14:24:14] <gdoron> Ohh...
[14:24:18] <systemfault> The DOM selector APIs
[14:24:22] <danheberden> i would use .add() if you want an order
[14:24:24] <gdoron> I know
[14:24:29] <danheberden> .add('selector1').add('selector2')
[14:24:34] <gdoron> Won't work
[14:25:01] <gdoron> As of jQuery 1.4 the results from .add() will always be returned in document order (rather than a simple concatenation).
[14:25:36] <gdoron> From the docs... I should have put that in quotes...
[14:25:53] <systemfault> johnkpaul: gave you an answer that works :/
[14:26:22] <danheberden> answers that work are so 2011
[14:26:35] <danheberden> THIS IS 2012 SYSTEMFAULT
[14:26:45] <gdoron> Yeah, it looks like I have no other way... :(
[14:26:47] <systemfault> danheberden: Ahhhh :/
[14:28:15] <shoky> cybuch: not rly ;P
[14:29:18] <gdoron> So, did we agree there isn't an other way?
[14:38:12] <plombardi> I'm new to js + jquery, boss asked me to whip up a quick UI for some services I wrote ...., this is probably trivially stupid, but I have two forms, and each has a .submit() for them... if I run the webpage the functions inside of submit() run without ever clicking submit. Is there a reason why this is occuring? http://pastebin.com/QQGhykuQ
[14:39:57] <shoky> plombardi:  because you're calling them
[14:40:09] <shoky>  $('#loginForm').submit(login("username", "password"));
[14:40:31] <shoky> you're running the login(...) function there, passing its return value as the first argument to .submit(..)
[14:40:53] <plombardi> shoky: I see... what I am trying to do is invoke login() on submit(..)
[14:41:10] <plombardi> rather than return the value of login to submit()
[14:41:26] <shoky> then:   .submit( function() {  login("username", "password"); } )
[14:41:37] <shoky> would be one way.
[14:45:24] <plombardi> shoky: ah, ok... hmmm - this is gonna be a long night!
[14:45:35] <shoky> ;p
[14:53:17] <sayd> is there a way to pass a serialized querystring to $.ajax's data property?
[14:53:39] <sayd> and have it transformed into json. or maybe how do i change foo=bar into json
[14:54:40] <johnkpaul> ?SerializeObject @ sayd
[14:54:54] <johnkpaul> ?jquery.serializeObject
[14:55:00] <johnkpaul> ?jquery.fn.serializeObject
[14:55:10] <johnkpaul> :) sayd, just google for that
[14:57:11] <sayd> k thanks
[15:00:06] <Innocentus> hi
[15:00:24] <Innocentus> how can I send a date-object via jquery-ajax
[15:00:30] <Innocentus> is this is a good idea?
[15:00:39] <johnkpaul> Innocentus: convert to iso8601 format
[15:00:40] <Innocentus> what is a portable date format? I want to reuse it in php
[15:00:45] <Innocentus> alright
[15:03:27] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: there is a quite little array with some values - how can I send it via ajax so PHP can use it directly as array?
[15:03:56] <johnkpaul> Innocentus: I don't know, that's  ##php question
[15:12:38] <splig> hi there. do you know hot to avoid set some class then i use autocomplete of jqueryui??
[15:13:00] <splig> hi there. do you know hot to avoid set some class then i use autocomplete of jqueryui?? i don't want rounded corners in input text
[15:13:39] <Innocentus> alert($.datepicker.formatDate('ISO_8601', dateObj)); will return ISO_8601 for me - why?!
[15:13:43] <Innocentus> dateObj is correct date object
[15:14:43] <lancehunt> splig: jqueryui inflicts a lot of classes upon you, but you could just override the offending class in your CSS to remove the rounding
[15:14:58] <lancehunt> this might be easier than removing it
[15:15:06] <Innocentus> splig: themeroller?
[15:16:03] <splig> Innocentus, i just dont want it in input text boxes, not in the rest.
[15:16:11] <splig> lancealtar, ok. let me try...
[15:16:12] <splig> thanks both
[15:16:39] <Innocentus> alert($.datepicker.formatDate('ISO_8601', dateObj)); will return ISO_8601 for me - why?!
[15:16:53] <Innocentus> why does it return the date format name ?
[15:19:31] <splig> lancealtar, Innocentus done! for you information, i used $( this ).removeClass( "ui-corner-all" ); when open autocomplete
[15:19:37] <splig> thanks!
[15:22:05] <danheberden> splig you can also remove the border-radius or whatever styles you want via css so you don't have to remove the class
[15:22:24] <Innocentus> yes, overriding it with css is a little bit more performant
[15:23:01] <lancehunt> Innocentus: the jqui example for formatDate seems to work for me:  $.datepicker.formatDate('yy-mm-dd', new Date(2007, 1 - 1, 26)
[15:23:10] <splig> danheberden, does it "redifine" a class from jquery itself??
[15:23:14] <danheberden> .ui-autocomplete.ui-corner-all { border-radius: 0; }
[15:23:22] <danheberden> you can override the styles
[15:23:31] <danheberden> that's the whole point of the jqui 'css framework'
[15:23:38] <splig> danheberden, yes, right, but then buttons are squared, and i don't want it
[15:23:53] <danheberden> you can specify just the frame or the app bar
[15:24:08] <Innocentus> lancehunt: hm, I use a date object from a datepicker
[15:24:15] <danheberden> or you might have to reintruduce the radius for the buttons
[15:24:23] <danheberden> just something to keep in mind is all
[15:24:48] <splig> ok thanks everybody
[15:24:55] <splig> and good night. that's enought for today
[15:27:39] <ryanaz> I have some of my own serverside parsing thing I'm doing intermixed in my html/javascript/css ....    Am I conflicting with any other syntax if I use %{syntax} to search/replace in code??
[15:27:57] <ryanaz> like ${..}   I don't think %{...} is conflicting with anything from the languages i know ...
[15:28:15] <lancehunt> Innocentus: are you parsing the resulting date using $.datepicker.parseDate(...)   ?
[15:28:36] <ryanaz> ${.. } is obviously jquery stuff.....  does anyone know if %{ ... } is conflicting with any other language syntax parsing that I'm missing?
[15:29:18] <lancehunt> ryanaz: %{...}  looks like some kind of templating syntax like handlebars or jquery.tmpl
[15:29:37] <lancehunt> it shouldnt affect jquery but could affect your templating
[15:29:39] <Innocentus> lancehunt: no
[15:30:00] <ryanaz> lancehunt:   so %{ .. } is spoken for in jquery templating ?
[15:30:00] <lancehunt> Innocentus: can you post a jsfiddle on what you are trying to do?
[15:30:02] <Innocentus> lancehunt: the resulting date is got by getDate on jquery ui datepicker after selecting a valid date
[15:30:09] <Innocentus> yes
[15:30:15] <Innocentus> lancehunt: ok
[15:33:34] <lancehunt> ryanz: no, I'm not sure what the %{ ... } is, but it looks like templating, just not jquery templating which uses ${ ... }
[15:34:18] <lancehunt> ryanz: it looks similar to ASP.NET MVC razor syntax
[15:34:48] <lancehunt> ryanz: if its server-side then jquery will be fine, since it will not be emitted to the client
[15:38:33] <coderanger> Is there any way to adjust the offset between the cursor and the helper in a sortable?
[15:39:51] <lancehunt> ryanaz: I did a quick google search and didnt see any other javascript templating that uses the % prefix so as long as you do proper ref-counting on the { ... } brackets, then you should be fine intermixing with other syntax
[15:40:21] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  cool, thank you...
[15:41:55] <lancehunt> Innocentus: I made a mistake in my formatDate test earlier...I see the same results if you use ISO_8601 as the format
[15:42:18] <lancehunt> Innocentus: any reason why  you cant use 'yy-mm-dd' explicitly?
[15:47:23] <Innocentus> lancehunt: sorry for the delay - well, I want to have ISO_8601
[15:47:52] <Innocentus> lancehunt: but they won't change an ISO format, right?
[15:48:01] <lancehunt> Innocentus: exactly
[15:48:04] <Innocentus> so I can also hardcode it
[15:48:26] <lancehunt> Innocentus: after looking at the code for datepicker, it looks like they wanted you to use it like this:
[15:48:30] <lancehunt> $.datepicker.ISO_8601
[15:48:48] <Innocentus> ah
[15:48:50] <Innocentus> a constant
[15:48:50] <lancehunt> its just a constant in the datepicker for easier reference
[15:48:52] <Innocentus> nice
[15:49:01] <Innocentus> much better
[15:49:12] <lancehunt> it would be nice if it worked more like .NET datetime formats
[15:50:27] <Innocentus> yes
[15:50:39] <Innocentus> it would be cool, if all front end stuff is .NET like or some other single format
[15:50:45] <Innocentus>  / convention
[15:50:48] <Innocentus> thank you - it works now
[15:50:53] <lancehunt> cool
[15:50:58] <Innocentus> they should mentioned it more strongely in documentation
[15:51:08] <lancehunt> yeah, jqueryui docs have become abysmal
[15:51:18] <lancehunt> the code = truth
[15:51:54] <Innocentus> they still don't got any timepickers - altough I love to reuse components as much as possible
[15:52:01] <Innocentus> so I have to use a 3rd party addon
[15:52:30] <lancehunt> well, theres the rub...using existing components is great, until its not
[15:53:02] <lancehunt> there is a point where unless you need  to turn every knob they make available its often faster/better to just write your own javascripts
[15:53:24] <lancehunt> I mine jquery/jqueryui a lot for inspiration, but rarely use them as-is
[15:53:42] <Innocentus> yes
[15:53:48] <Innocentus> it is very tempting tough
[15:55:09] <lancehunt> also, when you build products you often dont want your site to look like a 'jqueryui site', so you end up heavily modified....but its great for tools, utilities, and internal projects where it doesnt matter
[15:55:23] <Innocentus> is there a way to override all alert-calls to replace them with jquery ui dialogs?
[15:55:38] <Innocentus> lancehunt: I use the datepicker from jquery ui with an own theme
[15:56:17] <johnkpaul> Innocentus: yes, you can just overwrite window.alert, but you won't be able to preserve alert's blocking behavior
[15:56:44] <Innocentus> johnkpaul: so not recommendable
[15:56:58] <johnkpaul> no, not recommended
[15:57:37] <lancehunt> Innocentus: exactly, but you can often monkeypatch whatever lib is trying to call alert() instead
[15:57:52] <Innocentus> hm
[15:58:18] <Innocentus> another thing - an user enters some data, the data is sent to server via ajax - the server responds with a kind of list
[15:58:33] <Innocentus> instead of downloading a complete renderred html table, the table is built by a javascript array
[15:58:43] <Innocentus> how can this be optimized?
[15:59:03] <lancehunt> Innocentus: what is the bottleneck?
[15:59:41] <Innocentus> the data changes rarely - so it should be cached somehow, when the page loads the first time
[15:59:48] <Innocentus> how to sync the cached data?
[16:00:17] <lancehunt> Innocentus: this is a pretty common-pattern for hybrid javascript/server-rendered pages
[16:00:40] <Innocentus> are there jquery cache layers?
[16:01:03] <johnkpaul> Innocentus: https://github.com/paulirish/jquery-ajax-localstorage-cache
[16:01:25] <lancehunt> Innocentus: you usually will JSON serialize your rows on the server side and write them to a variable in a script tag on initial page load and htne use a setTimeout to refresh on an interval
[16:02:03] <Innocentus> looks good
[16:02:06] <lancehunt> Innocentus: localStorage is great if you are talking about very long-term cache
[16:02:30] <johnkpaul> lancehunt: that plugin is configurable, 5 hours by default
[16:02:47] <lancehunt> Innocentus: but if you are going to get another page-refresh or page-navigation (to/from server) then client-cache isnt neccessary
[16:03:06] <Innocentus> hm
[16:03:26] <lancehunt> I use localStorage a lot for single-page apps where the user never refreshes or navigates anywhere after initial page load
[16:03:37] <lancehunt> just depends upon your page/site
[16:04:21] <lancehunt> just keep in mind there is a limit to localStorage...and its slow
[16:06:03] <johnkpaul> lancehunt: if it's just used to cache some snippets of html, the limit probably wont' be reached, and it's only slow compared to some other operations, chances are it won't be the bottleneck
[16:06:51] <lancehunt> johnkpaul: true, I was just trying to explain that all of these decisions are relative to what type of page/app your building...I'm not sure Innocentus is building a single-page app
[16:07:17] <johnkpaul> oh, I see, yeah, definitely, I assumed that Innocentus was building a single page app
[16:07:23] <Innocentus> thank you people
[16:07:30] <Innocentus> I will check performance
[16:07:32] <johnkpaul> or at least making ajax calls periodically to update views for some reason
[16:07:32] <Innocentus> good night
[16:07:40] <lancehunt> gnight
[16:07:43] <johnkpaul> ha, he was out fast
[16:07:47] <lancehunt> :)
[16:09:16] <lancehunt> I've started to think of caching this way:   l1-cache = local/global variable, l2-cache = localStorage
[16:09:50] <lancehunt> most of the time you only need l1-cache
[16:10:14] <ryanaz> I'm confused... I got the dark-hive theme from jquery ui, and I'm looking at the demos of their code on there for the buttons in specific..  I'm not seeing some of the css elements provided in the theme..
[16:10:18] <ryanaz> such as:  .ui-buttonset .ui-button { margin-left: 0; margin-right: -.3em; }
[16:10:27] <ryanaz> I see that in the http://jqueryui.com/themes/base/jquery.ui.button.css
[16:10:41] <ryanaz> which is referenced in the demo ...  but it's not in the theme I downloaded.
[16:10:47] <ryanaz> am I missing something ?
[16:10:52] <johnkpaul> hm, I see the analogy completely, but I don't draw as much of a distinction, I like the localStorage API and if I'm caching something, I often want it persistent anyway
[16:10:54] <lancehunt> ryanaz: jquery.ui emits tons of crap, but its the choice of each theme on which to use
[16:11:32] <lancehunt> johnkpaul: perhaps, but sometimes managing cache is as much of a burdon as a blessing
[16:11:49] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  It seems to work fine in their demo ..
[16:11:55] <ryanaz> http://jqueryui.com/demos/button/#checkbox
[16:13:33] <lancehunt> ryanaz: sorry, I may have misread your question...you are saying that when you apply the theme, some items arent being themed?
[16:14:00] <ryanaz> yah, i'm re-downloading the theme and seeing if maybe I missed something
[16:16:16] <lancehunt> ryanaz: most styles derive from the jquery.ui.basetheme so make sure you have that too
[16:18:44] <lancehunt> ryanaz: iirc, the blackhive theme would have an @import of the base theme, but I havent looked at those themes in a while
[16:20:20] <ryanaz> it's working fine now that I'm hosting the theme myself, when I was using google's version it didn't have the right stuff
[16:20:20] <ryanaz> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.7.2/themes/dark-hive/jquery-ui.css
[16:20:29] <ryanaz> that didn't have the right margins set
[16:20:44] <lancehunt> lovely, CDN-fail
[16:21:33] <lancehunt> I've had similar problems with browser caching of CDN's where the CDN expiration headers werent handled correctly
[16:21:54] <shoky> you know that jqueryui is in 1.8.20 yes ?
[16:22:24] <ryanaz> yah....  i'm looking at that, not sure why I was linking to 1.7.2
[16:23:38] <ryanaz> that link doesn't seem to work
[16:23:44] <ryanaz> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.20/themes/dark-hive/jquery-ui.css
[16:23:57] <ryanaz> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.2/themes/dark-hive/jquery-ui.css
[16:23:58] <ryanaz> there we go
[16:24:51] <mathi> hi
[16:25:06] <mathi> I try to disable a checkbox like this: $('#searchAppletPatients').attr('disabled', true);
[16:25:11] <mathi> but it doesn't seem to work:(
[16:25:15] <mathi> I'm using Chrome
[16:27:25] <jrockjiggz> ?disable checkbox
[16:27:33] <jrockjiggz> =/
[16:28:08] <ryanaz> wow, this looks way better now that I'm actually pulling the full css for the theme.. ;)
[16:28:23] <ryanaz> shoky: thanks for making me realize that
[16:29:14] <ryanaz> ... that's why it's good to develop with IRC up ... once you hit a place where you're like "WTF?"  someone can slap you around
[16:29:50] <ryanaz> hard to find anyone knowledgeable within a 50 mile radius these days here in arizona...
[16:30:30] <ryanaz> anyone here live in Arizona ??
[16:30:58] <ryanaz> we're looking for a really good linux/unix guy..
[16:31:40] <ragnok> may i ask what the linux guy must do?
[16:33:01] <ragnok> nvm, that is offtopic
[16:33:14] <ryanaz> .....   it's completely unrelated to web development... we're doing a hadoop cluster at a "fortune 100" company
[16:33:17] <lancehunt> mathi: that is correct, so just make sure your selector is correct for that element
[16:33:42] <ryanaz> we have 150 nodes right now... going to scale to 1000 by end of year
[16:33:52] <ryanaz> right now i'm doing it all myself
[16:34:46] <lancehunt> ryanaz: hadoop for analytics or what?
[16:35:44] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  calculate pi
[16:35:50] <ryanaz> (kidding)
[16:35:52] <lancehunt> lol
[16:36:18] <lancehunt> 1000 nodes just sounded like you must be doing something 'interesting'
[16:36:18] <ryanaz> not my job to really care what they're using it for..
[16:36:44] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  Well, it's for a bleading edge financial institute... do the map reduce on that one..
[16:36:55] <ryanaz> bleeding
[16:37:27] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  I'm sure it's to help solve world piece.
[16:37:34] <lancehunt> ^
[16:37:42] <lancehunt> the basketball player?
[16:37:46] <lancehunt> :)
[16:37:49] <ryanaz> hah
[16:38:04] <lancehunt> he might need 1000 nodes
[16:38:58] <ryanaz> .. anyway.. sorry to take it off topic...  but it's mind blowing how many people we've interviewed who have impeccable resumes who are clueless.
[16:39:01] <lancehunt> map reduce failing....couldnt get past the oxymoron of 'bleeding edge' mixed with 'financial instituion'
[16:39:29] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  hence why I said that.. :)
[16:39:54] <lancehunt> yeah, tell me about it...candidates have been horrible in all sectors...I weep for our future
[16:40:32] <lancehunt> lots of tech people unemployed for good reason
[16:40:46] <chilversc> ryanaz: how come? map reduce as a concept is really simple?
[16:41:59] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  Seems like I don't find many people that tinker with stuff for fun any more....
[16:42:29] <lancehunt> ryanaz: my motto is to hire young, passionate engineers and teach them the skills...the passion is the hard part
[16:42:54] <systemfault> I agree..
[16:43:07] <systemfault> Passion.. I don't see that often..
[16:43:08] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  Seems like people are on facebook or texting instead of sitting at a unix prompt ...
[16:43:49] <lancehunt> lancehunt: sadly, many dont even know what bash is
[16:44:38] <systemfault> It's okay if you work for a .net shop :P
[16:44:42] <systemfault> </troll>
[16:44:43] <ryanaz> Ya know what my # 1 pet peeve is ?   When people don't tell me that they don't know something or have no experience with task XYZ ...
[16:44:56] <systemfault> ryanaz: What's wrong with that?
[16:45:17] <systemfault> ryanaz: I personally say.. no problem even if I don't know :P
[16:45:23] <systemfault> Then learn it :D
[16:45:36] <lancehunt> systemfault: I've spent over 12 years with Microsoft tech as a developer, but still managed to pickup a few things along the way
[16:45:40] <ryanaz> systemfault:  Sure, but seems like too many people don't go "learn it", they take the ball... and sit on it.
[16:45:48] <systemfault> ryanaz: Ah.. right
[16:46:05] <systemfault> lancehunt: :)
[16:46:52] <ryanaz> systemfault:  I  couldn't care less if someone knows something or not...  If I was to interview 10 years ago for all the stuff I've done over the last 10 years I probably wouldn't have been hired ....
[16:47:08] <systemfault> ryanaz: That's the spirit :)
[16:47:54] <lancehunt> ryanaz: are you saying you want the "i'm willing to learn..." attitude rather than the "sorry, I dont know that and could care less" attitude?
[16:48:29] <ryanaz> lancehunt:   "I'm willing to learn... " attitude but even more importantly don't tell me you're an expert for something you've never done before..
[16:48:48] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  I'd rather hear, "I have no idea what jquery is... but let's go write a new gmail... sounds good to me."
[16:49:01] <lancehunt> ryanaz: oh yeah, that one pisses me off
[16:49:38] <lancehunt> ryanaz: I love it when they fail the whiteboard test on something they claimed they were a 10 out of 10 on
[16:49:44] <chilversc> I never know why they think they can get away with it either, because any one who knows a little about the subject would catch them out right away
[16:49:56] <ryanaz> I'm not racist by any stretch of the imagination .... but if I get one more interview with an indian guy who says he's basically the next unix god... and can't tell me the syntax of a for loop I'm going to go nuts....
[16:50:06] <lancehunt> lol
[16:50:23] <ryanaz> lancehunt: EXACTLY!!!!!!!!!!!
[16:50:51] <lancehunt> luckily, our indians in Dallas seem to be a bit more honest than yours
[16:50:51] <ryanaz> lancehunt:   I mean come on .... don't tell me you know perl and then you can't tell me what "use strict;" is or even what a hash is or what the syntax for a hash is..
[16:51:04] <chilversc> ryanaz: well, its not just indians, but there's probably a fair few playing off their stereotype
[16:52:04] <ryanaz> chilversc:  I'm sure it's not indians... I think what happens is due to the "strategic direction" of these big companies they're only willing to pay so much, so they have vendor agreements with offshore vendors... so i think it's a double edged sword..
[16:52:13] <lancehunt> its okay to be ignorant or incompetent at something...hell, at any minute I'm incompetent in literally thousands of things, but just give me a little time...
[16:52:41] <ryanaz> lancehunt:   time + redbull + google + irc
[16:52:57] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  and a man page from time to time.. ;)
[16:52:57] <chilversc> ryanaz: right, its the generic problem with stereotypes, when its in a good light, there will always be someone willing to exploit that
[16:53:10] <systemfault> lancehunt: I love people like you… and hate the opposite..
[16:53:49] <systemfault> People who think they're competent… but they're not.
[16:54:21] <lancehunt> systemfault: the big problem is there are so many types of people who fail; liars, burnouts, clueless, exploiters, etc
[16:54:29] <ryanaz> I always tell people, "Assume I don't know anything.... but know that I'll get it working or figure it out."
[16:55:07] <ryanaz> i try to motivate others to help get it done....  seems to be more difficult than just doing it myself.
[16:55:46] <lancehunt> I like to surround myself with people smarter than me (usually not that hard) and then learn everythign I can from them...
[16:56:02] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  where u from ?
[16:56:12] <ryanaz> .. dallas ..
[16:56:21] <lancehunt> but the problem isnt always smarts; its a desire to ship/deliver
[16:56:24] <lancehunt> yup
[16:56:28] <ryanaz> just remembered seeing it above
[16:56:34] <lancehunt> brb
[16:56:39] <systemfault> lancehunt: I've been unlucky so far with people…. it's not that they're not smart… it's just that they don't care. :(
[16:58:05] <lancehunt> systemfault: yep, thats the "desire to deliver" thing I was talking about...lots of smart people  have the ability, but seem to fear success
[16:58:55] <systemfault> I'm by no means perfect… my biggest problem is that I become demotivated when there's no challenge.
[16:59:08] <systemfault> And end up wanting to find another job..
[16:59:34] <ryanaz> systemfault:  My biggest problem is that I want to deliver everything and have trouble giving realistic timelines...
[16:59:41] <systemfault> :D
[16:59:47] <chilversc> I always fear producing an inferior product, ie one that really anoys the users
[17:00:01] <systemfault> I'm not that bad with estimations now :P I always keep a good buffer :P
[17:00:05] <lancehunt> ryanaz: thats a hard one to overcome, but is critical to develop
[17:00:18] <ryanaz> systemfault:  I forget about small things like.. you know .... my wife's having a baby in a few weeks, anniversaries or even sleep I guess..
[17:00:20] <lancehunt> agile is your friend
[17:00:25] <systemfault> Haha
[17:00:46] <systemfault> agile feels so dirty now...
[17:00:50] <lancehunt> ryanaz: gratz
[17:00:51] <ryanaz> I've been weening on redbull and those green amp's way too much
[17:01:07] <lancehunt> ryanaz: monster for me
[17:01:07] <systemfault> Overused word… which has lost its meaning other than it's !waterfall
[17:01:22] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  lol, thanks....  well, we ended up having him 6 weeks ago.... he came 3 months early.
[17:01:22] <lancehunt> systemfault: how about scrum?
[17:01:38] <lancehunt> ryanaz: surprise! :)
[17:01:39] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  All is good...  doing well, should be home from hospital in a few weeks.  he's still in nicu
[17:01:41] <systemfault> lancehunt: Scrum is fine.. I don't think the certifications are worth it.
[17:02:08] <lancehunt> systemfault: certs = PMP trying to resurrect their career in light of agile manifesto
[17:02:17] <systemfault> I agree :)
[17:03:01] <lancehunt> "value individuals and interactions over processes and tools"
[17:04:19] <ryanaz> ... if you guys had to build a social media website would you do it with bare bones like javascript / jquery or would you enlist GWT, sproutcore, cappuccino ?
[17:04:20] <systemfault> Heh..
[17:04:23] <lancehunt> its amazing how wrong most agile practices are today, 11 years after manifesto
[17:04:41] <chilversc> systemfault: except for the new agile waterfall models :)
[17:04:55] <lancehunt> ryanaz: internal or external social media?
[17:04:59] <ryanaz> external
[17:05:19] <lancehunt> lancehunt: why would you want your site to look like everything else in the world?
[17:05:20] <systemfault> I think unfortunately… SEO is still too important… so you cannot use JS-only
[17:05:34] <lancehunt> weird, I just referenced myself...heh
[17:05:39] <chilversc> systemfault: I thought the scrum certs wern't really about the certs but more about learning how to do it properly from other people who had been there?
[17:05:52] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  you did that earlier too ..lol
[17:06:08] <lancehunt> tad narcisistic arent I?
[17:06:32] <lancehunt> chilversc: get a coach, not a cert
[17:06:37] <systemfault> :D
[17:06:42] <chilversc> systemfault: depends how you design it, if you're willing to accept only the latest, then pushstate can allow a blend of JS only and SEO friendly
[17:07:14] <chilversc> lancehunt: yeah, I suppose that's what people forgot, the cert was an end thing from a coach, and instead see the coach as just something to get a cert
[17:07:22] <lancehunt> ryanaz: if I wanted tobuild a world-class (facebook, twitter,  etc) social media site then I would probably build from scratch
[17:07:45] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  start your own toolkit?
[17:07:47] <lancehunt> chilversc: for the coach, I would prefer a trackrecord of good referrals over a cert
[17:08:04] <lancehunt> ryanaz: perhaps not for everything, but for the foundation, sure
[17:08:24] <ryanaz> lancehunt:  Yah, i'm having pretty good success with just my own library I've been building starting with just jquery
[17:08:30] <ryanaz> javascript + jquery
[17:08:42] <chilversc> lancehunt: but the problem again, is corp always looks towards certs, etc
[17:08:42] <systemfault> I wouldn't use jQuery directly.
[17:09:02] <lancehunt> ryanaz: but truthfully, I would probably start with a proof-of-concept using existing tools, then slowly replace them as I (and my team) grew
[17:09:22] <ryanaz> systemfault:  how would you 'in-directly' use jQuery?
[17:09:35] <systemfault> ryanaz: Wrap it..
[17:09:49] <lancehunt> ryanaz: watch adddy osmoni's videos on facades & mediators
[17:09:50] <ryanaz> right... like the GWT does?
[17:09:58] <systemfault> ryanaz: That way… the day jquery becomes bad.. you won't cry because your whole 10000000000 pages uses it
[17:10:10] <ZeroBeholder> that sounds silly. I was thinking you were using the non-minified version and pulled out the stuff you weren't using...
[17:10:37] <lancehunt> chilversc: corp always screw things up, like wanting proprietary products + service contracts rather than open-source projects + community
[17:11:02] <chilversc> lancehunt: well some propriatary and service contracts can be good
[17:11:07] <ZeroBeholder> ...people have to eat. Can't give everything away for free.
[17:11:17] <systemfault> AddyOsmani++
[17:11:21] <lancehunt> chilversc: only for the vendor of the proprietary product
[17:11:21] <ZeroBeholder> Even the people at mozilla have mortgages.
[17:11:36] <chilversc> lancehunt: such as if the propriatry is the glue code, that binds various opensource products together in a very specific way
[17:11:52] <lancehunt> ZeroBeholder: its not my job to pay their bills, its my job to ship a product
[17:12:37] <ZeroBeholder> Right, that open source anything exists is a miracle and I am horribly grateful because I also have to ship a product.
[17:12:47] <lancehunt> chilversc: as long as your making concious tradeoffs its fine, but blindly choosing proprietary or open-source based upon dogmatic policies that make a CEO feel good is stupid
[17:13:28] <astropirate> prrfftt making the CEO feel good is your only job as a developer
[17:13:48] <lancehunt> astropirate: only if I'm the CEO  :)
[17:14:01] <lancehunt> astropirate: I dont plan on working for 'the man' forever
[17:14:19] <astropirate> lol
[17:14:22] <ZeroBeholder> I think maybe this conversation is more about standards so that the job is easier regardless of the licensing.
[17:14:38] <astropirate> lancealtar, you are a consultant?
[17:14:59] <ZeroBeholder> If you had a method that worked regardless of the layer underneath open source or proprietary wouldn't matter.
[17:15:07] <lancehunt> ZeroBeholder: sortof, its really just a way of saying they wante commodotizable, replacable employees
[17:15:48] <lancehunt> astropirate: naw, I've done the consulting thing and didnt like the game...trying to go entrepreneur now
[17:16:36] <astropirate> lancealtar, working on a product yet? or still brainstorming
[17:17:04] <systemfault> astropirate: wrong nickname darling
[17:17:26] <astropirate> woooppss
[17:17:41] <astropirate> lancehunt, ^^  stupid autocomplete <_<
[17:17:45] <lancehunt> astropirate: I have a few products in the queue, but nothing released right yet
[17:17:51] <lancehunt> hehe no worries
[17:18:06] <lancehunt> astropirate: I have a day-job that keeps me too busy
[17:18:17] <lancehunt> and I spend too much time on IRC
[17:18:18] <lancehunt> :P
[17:18:21] <astropirate> LOL
[17:18:25] <ZeroBeholder> Well anyways. I was wondering if anyone could help me with a AJAX weirdness. http://jsfiddle.net/yzTZB/1/
[17:19:16] <lancehunt> whats the problem?
[17:19:19] <ZeroBeholder> The surrounding code seems to work. But the .post hasn't executed once. It is just two pieces of data that are used in a delete from table SQL query of the php script called.
[17:20:18] <ZeroBeholder> Literally, the script it posts to opens the session, opens a database connection, builds a SQL statement that gets executed then everything closes.
[17:20:25] <astropirate> ZeroBeholder, are you running into an async problem? Give that POST request a callback
[17:20:46] <ZeroBeholder> Maybe, what is an asynch problem?
[17:21:13] <ZeroBeholder> It going asynch shouldn't be a problem. The entries in the database are sitting there waiting for the delete.
[17:21:16] <astropirate> that POST request isn't blocking, as it is making the request, subsequent lines of code are executed
[17:21:40] <ZeroBeholder> Ooh, looks like I have some googling in front of me.
[17:21:41] <lancehunt> if you open the Network tab in your browser, do you see the request?
[17:21:41] <MacroMan> My .on("click") isn't working. Can anyone offer some advice: http://jsfiddle.net/7Sz92/   ?
[17:21:51] <ZeroBeholder> I will do that now.
[17:22:26] <ZeroBeholder> Where is my network tab?
[17:22:36] <ZeroBeholder> I have firebug installed... is it in there?
[17:22:40] <lancehunt> ZeroBeholder, you might also look into how jquery ajax promises work as an alternative approach
[17:22:41] <astropirate> yes
[17:23:54] <ZeroBeholder> Crap-- POST https://bradchesney.net:8443/facebook/checkout/deletefromcart.php
[17:23:56] <ZeroBeholder> 	
[17:23:57] <lancehunt> MacroMan: your class isnt applied anywhere, so your selector is failing
[17:23:57] <ZeroBeholder> 200 OK
[17:23:59] <ZeroBeholder> 		174ms
[17:24:15] <lancehunt> MacroMan: add it to the div:  class="ani_element"
[17:24:26] <ZeroBeholder> It seems to be calling. But the SQL is right. Now I am confused.
[17:24:43] <MacroMan> lancehunt: A div with that class is added with the line after the selector: $('#main').append('<div class="ani_element"></div>');
[17:24:57] <MacroMan> lancehunt: Hence, why I'm using .on and not .click
[17:25:08] <PIKER32> MacroMan: strange, if i use live it works fine
[17:25:08] <lancehunt> MacroMan: sorry, quick trigger as usual from me
[17:25:21] <ZeroBeholder> --as a replacement for delegate I am assuming. I miss delegate.
[17:25:29] <lancehunt> MacroMan: yes, your click binding is firing before the element exists
[17:25:39] <ZeroBeholder> That was a tangent from macromans issue...
[17:26:24] <MacroMan> lancehunt: Yes, but .on is a delegated selector and so should pick this event up. This is the trick I use with ajax, which seems to be working still. I would use .live, but it's depreciated now
[17:27:38] <MacroMan> PIKER32: It is strange. .live worked for me too, so I don't understand why .on isn't :(
[17:27:59] <ZeroBeholder> They seem to have crammed .live .delegate.bind .andanotherone all into .on
[17:28:31] <lancehunt> yes, I was just playing with that trying to get the 'on' verson of 'live' to work
[17:28:46] <lancehunt> I thought it was simply adding a selector to the 'on'
[17:29:12] <MacroMan> It is odd, because if the element is added via another route, say ajax, then it works fine. It just seems to be when the element is appended.
[17:29:29] <ZeroBeholder> Well, I am going to bang my head against a wall since the AJAX part is working.
[17:29:40] <ZeroBeholder> Says the console...
[17:29:42] <lancehunt> try this:  $('div').on("click", '.ani_element', null, function(){ .. });
[17:29:43] <chilversc> ZeroBeholder: yeah, they went with the idea that .on handles events, like a facade over all the different kinds of events
[17:29:45] <shoky> $( selector ).live('eventtype', fn)  ===  $(document).on('eventtype', selector, fn)
[17:30:21] <ZeroBeholder> Shoky wrecks problems. I'd try whatever that is with the quickness.
[17:30:28] <shoky> wat?
[17:30:44] <lancehunt> MacroMan: http://jsfiddle.net/7Sz92/
[17:31:00] <ZeroBeholder> I'm saying that you usually come up with kick ass solutions.
[17:31:02] <PIKER32> http://jsfiddle.net/7Sz92/2/
[17:31:05] <shoky> ahh
[17:31:08] <shoky> ;D
[17:31:09] <MacroMan> lancehunt: That's the original link I posted
[17:31:19] <shoky> better to use something else in place of 'document' though
[17:31:21] <lancehunt> oh, let me save and resend
[17:31:29] <PIKER32> MacroMan: http://jsfiddle.net/7Sz92/2/
[17:31:32] <MacroMan> PIK
[17:31:35] <lancehunt> http://jsfiddle.net/7Sz92/3/
[17:32:02] <MacroMan> PIKER32: Of course. I think I've just written it slightly wrong, but that works fine. Thanks for your help everyone
[17:32:06] <lancehunt> goodluck...bbl
[17:32:56] <PIKER32> shoky posting syntax turned hte lightbulb on
[17:33:32] <PIKER32> i guess its for faster traversing so it isnt scanning for .ani_element across the entire document
[18:01:34] <ryanaz> anyone here have a godaddy "dedicated virtual host"?  I'm finding that my "vim" sessions get killed every hour on the hour .... is there some sort of VIM setting or a watchdog or something on the box that I can't find killing these sessions?  I've asked godaddy about it and they're clueless..
[18:01:49] <wavez> I'm having trouble figuring out an issue with jqGrid. I posted the issue here. Please scroll to the last two replies. http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=393/help/progress-bar-cells/
[18:01:59] <johnkpaul> ryanaz: that might be ssh keep alive, or something like that
[18:02:16] <johnkpaul> ask #linux, ryanaz
[18:02:18] <ryanaz> johnkpaul:  ssh keepalive?   The ssh sessions stay alive...
[18:02:38] <johnkpaul> oh, then what is being killed everyhour?
[18:02:42] <ryanaz> vim
[18:03:01] <johnkpaul> the process itself is killed?
[18:03:04] <ryanaz> ya
[18:03:12] <johnkpaul> oh, wow, no idea
[18:03:17] <danheberden> i think part of your problem is the "godaddy" part
[18:03:17] <ryanaz> Vim: Caught deadly signal TERMC
[18:03:22] <ryanaz> lol
[18:03:31] <ryanaz> Vim: Finished.
[18:03:34] <ryanaz> Terminated
[18:03:37] <ryanaz> $
[18:04:02] <ryanaz> it's been buggin me for years, but i haven't taken the time to look for a different hosting
[18:07:03] <wavez> I'm trying to add jQuery progress bars to a jqGrid but I'm having trouble getting the call to happen only once, in different situations. When the sort order is changed on the grid, the call happens once, but when loading from an array, the call happens for each row added. http://www.trirand.com/blog/?page_id=393/help/progress-bar-cells/
[18:07:09] <wavez> ^ scroll the to bottom
[18:10:21] <johnkpaul> wavez: do you have a working example of your problem on jsfiddle or something?
[18:10:51] <wavez> I'll try putting it on there
[18:10:58] <ryanaz> wow that was fun... #linux is just the same bunch of whiney babies they have always been.
[18:11:31] <systemfault> Why would you go there?
[18:11:41] <ryanaz> I asked them about the vim question...
[18:11:42] <johnkpaul> that'd be because of me
[18:11:46] <ryanaz> 30 lines of people slamming for "off topic discussion" and 1 or 2 lines of someone mentioning anything relevant
[18:12:26] <ryanaz> within 15 lines of irc chatter one of the guys promoted himself to operator and they all had a feeding frenzy ... i told them to go to hell enjoy their #linux and parted to not return for another 10 years (like last time)
[18:12:37] <ryanaz> I'm guessing he kick,banned me or took my voice away or something.... lol
[18:12:55] <ryanaz> good ol' efnet days
[18:12:57] <ryanaz> miss those days
[18:13:47] <aot2002> setinterval -> is it possible to get the current countdown from it?
[18:14:07] <johnkpaul> aot2002: what is the "Current countdown"?
[18:14:28] <shoky> time left till next trigger i suppose
[18:14:48] <shoky> which is f'in easy to get
[18:14:58] <wavez> johnkpaul, will jsfiddle have the jQuery libraries I need?
[18:15:08] <johnkpaul> wavez: no, you can add them on the left side
[18:15:11] <johnkpaul> "add resources"
[18:16:18] <johnkpaul> shoky: how would you get the time till the next trigger? you'd have to set up something around setInterval
[18:16:41] <shoky> yes that's what i meant
[18:17:29] <shoky> new Date() - lastTriggerTime;
[18:17:35] <shoky> lastTriggerTime = new Date()
[18:17:38] <shoky> ^^ f'in easy
[18:18:55] <aot2002> johnkpaul: Can I get the interval seconds from setinterval so that when it's counting down I can get the seconds where it's currently at?
[18:19:35] <johnkpaul> aot2002: no, it's not exactly counting down, setInterval/Timeout are imprecise
[18:19:44] <danheberden> i'd recommend using setTimeout and managing time yourself
[18:19:48] <aot2002> K
[18:19:49] <johnkpaul> you can do some of that yourself, in the way shoky described
[18:24:02] <ryanaz> can anyone tell me why the first "email" field isn't getting the focus automatically:   https://beta.stratfuel.com/main.cgi?page=login_front
[18:24:11] <c0pp3rnick> anyone uses jeditable?
[18:24:28] <shoky> not a soul
[18:24:38] <c0pp3rnick> shoky, okay, bb =)
[18:24:44] <shoky> tt
[18:25:12] <johnkpaul> ryanaz: why would it get the focus?
[18:25:24] <johnkpaul> it doesn't have the autofocus attribute, and I don't see anything in the javascript that would focus it
[18:25:31] <ryanaz> it used to before I switched to 1.8.2 .... 1.7.x automatically had focus in the first field
[18:27:37] <johnkpaul> ryanaz: oh I see. Add autofocus:true to your dialog options
[18:45:47] <Soleino^> Hello everyboy, can please someone recommand me a jquery slider, that can slides images with a paragraph and its title .. and optionally have a dots pagination
[19:02:13] <wavez> jsfiddle is really painful to use because I'm working on a netbook. Is there a better option?
[19:03:20] <jrockjiggz> that doesn't even make sense
[19:03:33] <mhatter> hey there
[19:03:52] <mhatter> Anyone here who can help with what seems like a very simple issue with .ajax post response?
[19:04:15] <jrockjiggz> what is your problem?
[19:05:02] <mhatter> according to Firebug, I'm getting a numeric response (ie. 0, or 58, 59, etc), but in the browser Javascript, if I alert(postResponse), I get "object object"
[19:05:19] <mhatter> If I use .ajax with a GET instead of POST it all works fine.
[19:05:28] <mhatter> I'm posting to a Coldfusion .cfc component.
[19:05:52] <mhatter> code looks like this:
[19:05:53] <mhatter> var postResponse = $.ajax( { 				type: "post", 				url: "cfc/states.cfc?method=AddState&returnformat=JSON", 				dataType: "text", 				data: postData  			} )
[19:07:05] <jrockjiggz> what does console.log(postResponse); give?
[19:08:03] <mhatter> ReferenceError: postResponse is not defined
[19:08:41] <mhatter> I know nothing of how Firebug's console works though...
[19:08:58] <systemfault> Time to learn
[19:09:04] <mhatter> lol, thanks. :P
[19:09:36] <Soleino^> can someone recommand me a jquery slider, that can slides images with a paragraph and its title .. and optionally have a dots pagination
[19:10:21] <mhatter> looking at the Net/Response tab of Firebug, I see exactly what I would expect... "-1" and the HTML tab shows the same thing.
[19:10:57] <mhatter> The response header shows "Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8" with Transfer-Encoding "chunked"
[19:12:19] <wavez> jrockjiggz, small screen
[19:12:55] <wavez> jsfiddle crams 4 panes into one page
[19:13:00] <jrockjiggz> wavez: code editor + browser is always faster, but local..
[19:13:21] <mhatter> Anyone have any ideas of where I can look to debug this?
[19:13:55] <wavez> jrockjiggz, I'm pasting from my local files, but I have to edit the code to use only the sections I'm debugging
[19:14:20] <jrockjiggz> mhatter: if your console.log is giving undefined, then you are not assigning the return data properly... sharing your code would also help.
[19:15:02] <mhatter> jrockjiggz: The code snippet is exactly what I posted above: var postResponse = $.ajax( { type: "post", url: "cfc/states.cfc?method=AddState&returnformat=JSON", dataType: "text", data: postData   } )
[19:15:24] <systemfault> Anyway.. it's not like postResponse will be the post response..
[19:15:47] <sebastian_o|> hi guys, I have an autocomplete question
[19:15:52] <jrockjiggz> mhatter: then you are missing success: function(data){ return data; }
[19:15:56] <sebastian_o|> in this example: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[19:16:13] <mhatter> on the server, here's what I have happening: I'm either returning a -1 (if the record exists) or an id of the newly created record.
[19:16:49] <sebastian_o|> when the autocomplete creates the ajax call it sets success callback
[19:17:11] <sebastian_o|> what exactly is response there? a property? of who?
[19:17:21] <ryanaz> johnkpaul:  dialog({      autoFocus: true }) isn't working.
[19:17:29] <sebastian_o|> a function? of who?
[19:18:54] <sebastian_o|> is it right to think it's creating right there the response function for the autocomplete object?
[19:19:57] <jrockjiggz> mhatter: your method of assign your ajax to a variable will be flawed because ajax is asynchronous and such your variable will have not have any value until your ajax request has completed. you should be using callbacks
[19:20:50] <mhatter> jrockjiggz: I think I see the problem.  If that solves it, I'll love you for the day! :)
[19:21:17] <ryanaz> any thoughts how to get the dialog to have autofocus?
[19:23:33] <sebastian_o|> for the record this answers what I was asking for: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5182567/what-does-this-javascript-response-function-do
[19:24:14] <ryanaz> johnkpaul:  It seems like most people in google are complaining about how they don't want autofocus..
[19:24:56] <mhatter> jrockjiggz: You are a rockstar.  Thank you! :)
[19:25:07] <mhatter> I don't suppose you're looking for a job? :-P
[19:25:26] <shoky> ryanaz: .dialog doesn't have an autoFocus option
[19:25:53] <shoky> ryanaz: just call .focus() on the textfield you wanna focus
[19:26:03] <ryanaz> shoky:  Yah, i'm wondering if I'm pointing to the 1.8.2 and not 1.8.20 ?
[19:26:23] <ryanaz> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.2/themes/dark-hive/jquery-ui.css
[19:26:30] <ryanaz> https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.8.20/themes/dark-hive/jquery-ui.css doesn't seem to exist
[19:28:29] <danheberden> ryanaz yeah that's a problem
[19:28:45] <danheberden> scott_gonzalez ^
[19:29:28] <shoky> ryanaz: http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.20/themes/dark-hive/jquery-ui.css
[19:29:54] <danheberden> bot-t: you alive buddy?
[19:30:08] <danheberden> bummer
[19:30:09] <ryanaz> shoky: thanks, still no autoFocus
[19:30:22] <shoky> yeah there's no autoFocus option as i said
[19:31:26] <ryanaz> shoky: yah but it used to do it a few hours ago before I updated everything.
[19:31:46] <ryanaz> seems like it's supposed to do it
[19:32:14] <shoky> maybe the behaviour changed in jqui..
[19:32:24] <shoky> so you can just focus whatever you want
[19:32:30] <ryanaz> right, what's the syntax for that?
[19:32:38] <shoky> .focus()
[19:32:50] <shoky> on the textfield
[19:33:34] <ryanaz> ok, thats' workin
[19:33:37] <ryanaz> weird.
[19:35:07] <shoky> stuff changes between versions, not too weird
[19:35:13] <ZeroBeholder> Does anyone here 'work' for jQuery? Or is it roughly 100% of people that make my days easier from the goodness of their hearts?
[19:36:36] <ZeroBeholder> I've been here put the kids to bed, cleaned the stove, solved a PHP problem and shoky is still here wrecking problems...
[19:37:01] <ZeroBeholder> Not complaining, just taking notice.
[19:38:26] <systemfault> shoky is a machine :P
[19:38:36] <shoky> i'm mostly here procrastinating stuff i should really be doing ;P
[19:39:14] <systemfault> :D
[19:41:11] <ryanaz> Do you have the link to the 1.8.20 jquery-ui min anywhere?  I can get the 1.8.19 but not the 1.8.20
[19:41:12] <ryanaz> weird
[19:42:08] <ryanaz> found it http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.8.20/jquery-ui.min.js
[19:42:28] <ryanaz> are there any problems with pointing an https to non https javascript files?  seems like the browser compalined about it
[19:43:19] <shoky> prolly just a warning
[19:50:13] <martisj> how do i fadout two elements?
[19:50:37] <martisj> It's not possible to do a comme sepearted list of elemns :S
[19:51:27] <ryanaz> shoky:  I guess 1.8.2 has a bug where there is no focus() on the first element.... 1.8.20 works fine.  :-/
[19:51:37] <systemfault> martisj: It's async.. just fade them one after the other..
[19:51:54] <systemfault> martisj: It will be at the same time..
[19:51:58] <martisj> systemfault: seems reasonable :)
[19:52:02] <martisj> thanks systemfault
[19:52:06] <systemfault> :)
[20:02:21] <ZeroBeholder> systemfault you're guilty of being crazy helpful too. I'm not playing favorites. I just happened to see shoky first.
[20:02:41] <systemfault> :/ I'm a bot
[20:03:51] <systemfault> I should have worked this weekend but I've been lazy..
[20:13:49] <shoky> ;-<
[20:14:16] <shoky> i can say the same thing about the past month ;(
[20:19:27] <tash> if I want to test whether something exists with id="qty", shouldn't this work? if ( ! $("#id") ) { // stuff here } ?
[20:19:32] <tash> didn't seem to when I tried it that way
[20:19:43] <tash> um
[20:19:57] <tash> i meant if ( ! $("#qty") )
[20:22:31] <starsinmypockets> IMsaybe I'm running afoul of a misunderstanding about scope in javascript?
[20:22:33] <starsinmypockets> http://pastebin.com/C6jPV6r4
[20:22:59] <starsinmypockets> console.log(i) within the success function shows the expected value...
[20:23:14] <starsinmypockets> however this isn't passed to the ajax url, which is messing me up
[20:24:40] <systemfault> tash: Check the .length
[20:25:35] <systemfault> starsinmypockets: In JS, you have access to the outer scope
[20:26:14] <tash> systemfault: ok, so like if ( $("#qty").length == 0 ) { // blah } ?
[20:26:20] <systemfault> Yeah
[20:26:47] <starsinmypockets> gsystemfault - do you see what I'm trying to do? I want to add an iterator to the url that goes up with each ajax call..
[20:27:04] <starsinmypockets> systemfault!
[20:27:12] <systemfault> Yeah?
[20:27:42] <systemfault> It should work, no?
[20:28:25] <poppiez> does datepicker have a utility function where I can do something like someDate + 1d or someDate + 1m?
[20:28:34] <poppiez> or any other plugin for that matter
[20:30:01] <starsinmypockets> lol actually it does... my php was wrong
[20:30:23] <systemfault> :D
[20:30:50] <starsinmypockets> nite all ;)
[20:31:31] <tash> systemfault: thanks
[20:31:33] <tash> that worked
[20:31:42] <systemfault> :)
[20:36:13] <martisj> is there a quick and dirty way to update the view when an ajax call has been made ?
[20:36:23] <martisj> something in the success method ?
[20:36:50] <systemfault> You can do whatever you want in the success method..
[20:47:11] <klawd_prime> hi!
[20:47:28] <klawd_prime> is there a way to tell $.ajax the request method to use?
[20:47:38] <shoky> Yes
[20:47:42] <shoky> have u read teh Docs?!?!
[20:47:59] <ZeroBeholder> klawd_prime, it is one of the required parameters...
[20:48:20] <ZeroBeholder> get post forget the other ones...
[20:48:25] * PIKER32 gets his pitchfork
[20:48:27] <ZeroBeholder> can't remember
[20:48:52] <klawd_prime> oh! type! ok.
[20:48:57] <klawd_prime> overlooked that when skimming the docs
[20:49:07] <ZeroBeholder> If you want you can use the .post method or .get
[20:49:08] <shoky> skimming would do that
[20:49:22] <klawd_prime> ZeroBeholder: i get the request method as a parameter to m function
[20:50:38] <AlecTaylor> hi
[20:51:12] <AlecTaylor> Does heavy JavaScript use adversely impact Googleability? - http://programmers.stackexchange.com/q/151440
[20:51:52] <PIKER32> you SEO?
[20:51:57] <PIKER32> you mean*
[20:52:29] <tw2113> i don't see how it would
[20:53:06] <systemfault> AlecTaylor: Think of the google bot as seeing your pages without javascript
[20:53:23] <tw2113> ideally, your sites should work fine without js
[20:53:33] <systemfault> AlecTaylor: If you create everything dynamically with javascript then…. the google bot will see nothing
[20:53:46] <systemfault> So.. you killed your SEO
[20:54:11] <systemfault> AlecTaylor: Usually, what you would do is called "progressive enhancement"
[20:54:42] <systemfault> AlecTaylor: You provide the basic functionality + content without javascript then you add JS to make the page more interactive.
[20:55:44] <AlecTaylor> Hmm
[20:56:01] <AlecTaylor> So the Google Bot still can't "see" JavaScript?
[20:56:19] <ryanaz> AlecTaylor:  It sounds lie googlebot doesn't execute any javascript.. probably strips it from the page
[20:57:45] <AlecTaylor> >.< - Just makes this whole development much more complicated if I need to work out the dynamic content for the website using one technique (Django or web2py templates) and the mobile app using another technique (RPC or REST with JavaScript)
[20:57:46] <AlecTaylor> :(
[20:58:57] <systemfault> Heh :/
[20:59:08] <systemfault> It sucks.. I know.
[20:59:23] <AlecTaylor> :cry:
[21:01:03] <AlecTaylor> What if I exposed an RSS feed of the information I want Google to index?
[21:01:35] <PIKER32> is alot of the information somewhat redundant?
[21:02:24] <PIKER32> if its in the ballpark of your meta tags, the bot ignores similiar information on the same page
[21:02:46] <PIKER32> _trying_ to make you feel better
[21:03:35] <AlecTaylor> >.<
[21:04:02] <AlecTaylor> I'm thinking to use Moku, Django templates or web2py templates server-side to generate "static" pages with dynamic content. - Will that be better for SEO?
[21:07:27] <PIKER32> if it gets the content in the markup on the initial load id say yes
[21:09:01] <tw2113> you want seo...have content on the page at the point the spider crawls
[21:11:08] <AlecTaylor> tw2113: So do it server-side is what you're saying
[21:13:01] <tw2113> do what? JS interaction?
[21:14:04] <AlecTaylor> tw2113: No, do server-side what is currently planned to be populated using javascript and remote calls over REST or RPC
[21:14:42] <tw2113> would you have zero content on the page on initial load if you had js disabled?
[21:19:20] <martisj> is the only way to append text to the .html() of an element by temporarily storing the text from .html()?
[21:19:43] <martisj> $('#likes-'+getID).html($('#likes-'+getID).html + "some awesome string that will change the world")?
[21:20:05] <AlecTaylor> You can append using DOM
[21:20:24] <martisj> AlecTaylor: hmmmm.
[21:20:29] <martisj> i'll cheack
[21:21:29] <systemfault> Just use .append :/
[21:21:55] <systemfault> Just use .html when you need to set or get the html of an element.. not to append
[21:23:02] <martisj> systemfault: thanks
[21:24:07] <ryanaz> is there a javascript equivalent to perl's Dumper(%hash) ?
[21:24:22] <systemfault> What is it supposed to do?
[21:24:39] <ryanaz> ie.  $('#output').html(Dumper(json));
[21:24:52] <systemfault> :/
[21:24:58] <ryanaz> basically, translate the json object into human readable text and put it somewhere to see it
[21:25:02] <systemfault> Ah!
[21:25:17] <systemfault> Just output the json itself?
[21:25:18] <ZeroBeholder> I google javascript pretty printer.
[21:25:25] <ZeroBeholder> That is not a joke. Sadly.
[21:25:28] <ryanaz> systemfault: ya
[21:26:15] <ryanaz> or am I missing a javascript debugging tool somewhere?
[21:27:18] <ZeroBeholder> I use firebug and you can get run-time variable states from that.
[21:28:48] <ZeroBeholder> You can set break points. Then when your script freezes as expected you can look to see what you have in your variables.
[21:30:06] <ZeroBeholder> Chrome has similar functionality built in-- but I am far less familiar with how that works as I am only using chrome as a user, not so much as a developer outside of my code functioning and/or the layout not getting super broken.
[21:31:03] <ZeroBeholder> Firebug is more or less only for Firefox. **Yes, I know of the incomplete porting efforts...
[21:35:10] <ryanaz> ZeroBeholder:  thank you
[21:36:14] <martisj> how would i append some text to an element and then fade it in ?
[21:37:37] <systemfault> You cannot fade text but you can fade an element containing text
[21:38:43] <systemfault> var text = $('<span>HI!</span>').hide(); myHtml.append(text); text.fadeIn(250);
[21:46:13] <ryanaz> Looks like 'firebug' is what I wanted... shows the json requests and everything right there.... no need to display it and debug it like I would a perl/cgi or whatever
[21:48:21] <tw2113> mmm inspector tools
[21:49:30] <systemfault> I prefer the chrome dev tools :P
[21:50:42] <tw2113> whichever gets the job done for you
[21:56:22] <xinming> In some web site, There is a thumbnail on images, And there are small (numbers or maybe dots) on one of the corner in that thumbnail, What is this kind of plugin called in JQuery please?
[21:57:24] <xinming> And I found a plugin in jquery which is slider, And I don't think that's what I mean really.
[21:58:09] <systemfault> xinming: Take a look at nivoslider
[21:59:07] <xinming> systemfault: thanks
[22:04:41] <thescion> hey. I've come across a script enclosed like this: (function ($) {  $(function () { ###script### }) })( jQuery.noConflict() );
[22:04:54] <thescion> is any...or all of that needed?
[22:05:29] <systemfault> Usually, no
[22:05:43] <systemfault> The guy probably had conflicts between 2 libraries using the $ sign
[22:05:55] <thescion> I understand the purpose of noConflict(), but is that the right way to do it?
[22:06:29] <systemfault> Why not?
[22:06:40] <thescion> it seems... elaborate
[22:06:40] <systemfault> There's no "right way"
[22:06:59] <systemfault> That's basic JS :(
[22:07:16] <thescion> you seem sad
[22:07:25] <systemfault> I'm working tomorrow.
[22:07:36] <thescion> you'll be ok
[22:07:56] <shoky> :(
[22:08:12] <thescion> now you've made shoky sad
[22:08:47] <systemfault> What have I done!!?!?!??!!!
[22:09:04] <thescion> systemfault: can you give me an idea of what the different parts above do?
[22:09:08] <systemfault> BBBBAAAWWWWWWW while(true) { console.log('W'); }
[22:09:19] <systemfault> thescion: Yeah
[22:10:01] <systemfault> (function($) {})(jQuery.noConflict());  is an application of the classical javascript module pattern
[22:10:45] <systemfault> jQuery.noConflict() returns the jquery object… that is passed as $ to the function
[22:12:09] <thescion> ok. and without .noConflict(), $ would be set in the window scope?
[22:12:17] <systemfault> Yeah
[22:12:53] <systemfault> jQuery.noConflict() is normally used to resolve (guess what) conflicts with other libraries using the $ sign… like prototype
[22:13:13] <thescion> and $( is just like $(document).ready(
[22:13:19] <systemfault> :D Yes!
[22:13:36] <dytrived`> .seen iszak
[22:13:40] <shoky> it's pretty much the same as doing:  (function ($) { $.noConflict(); ### script ### })( jQuery );
[22:13:41] <thescion> so it actually all has a legitimate use
[22:13:45] <dytrived`> ircjsbot: seen iszak
[22:13:45] <ircjsbot> dytrived`, I last saw iszak 3 days and 7 hours ago, quitting with the message “Quit: Iszak”.
[22:13:49] <jrockjiggz> hey just wondering if anyone can share what your coding program of choice is ?  i use EditPlus and its starting to bother me
[22:13:59] <shoky> or: $.noConflict(); (function ($) { ### script ### })( jQuery );
[22:14:03] <dytrived`> ircjsbot: tell iszak sup bro
[22:14:03] <ircjsbot> dytrived`, OK, I will tell iszak if I see them.
[22:14:15] <thescion> shoky: that also waits till document is ready?
[22:14:17] <systemfault> thescion: Unless you have troubles.. with other libraries, you don't need noConflict :)
[22:14:33] <shoky> thescion: no i ommited that part (cause i see it as just part of the script..)
[22:14:41] <thescion> shoky: ok
[22:15:08] <thescion> systemfault: this is on a Magento site so prototype is there too
[22:15:20] <systemfault> That's why then :P
[22:15:49] <thescion> shoky: so there's no shorter way to write it then, just perhaps more readable ways?
[22:16:15] <systemfault> thescion: If you want to use the $, no
[22:17:02] <thescion> neat. thanks for explaining :)
[22:17:06] <systemfault> You could do: var rofl = jQuery.noConflict(); then use rofl like you would use the $ (i.e. rofl('div') )
[22:17:24] <thescion> or golf =
[22:17:35] <systemfault> rofl is BETTAH!
[22:17:39] <systemfault> :/
[22:17:51] <thescion> g is better for golf I suppose

[22:28:12] <SrPx> What is a pretty way to present an informative popup (that is, the instructions of an app)? Guess jquery has something for this?
[22:28:29] <abjorn> :o
[22:28:54] <systemfault> Nah, jQuery doesn't have anything for that :/
[22:29:04] <systemfault> Perhaps jQuery UI or some other library.
[22:29:34] <systemfault> Personally, I made my company buy fancybox 2… best plugin of that type IMHO

[23:28:50] <abrkn> i'm doing $(window).on('beforeunload', function()......) in one of my unit tests and it makes my unit test framework very upset when jquery sets the window.jQuery123123
[23:29:35] <shoky> then use a different test framework or configure this one to chill
[23:29:53] <abrkn> i guess that would make more sense
[23:30:17] <shoky> the jQuery<random num>  attribute is where jQuery stores data for elements

[23:36:47] <pneftali> hi guys
[23:38:03] <pneftali> how do you guys handle multiple successive button clicks ? basically i wanted to only take the initial click and disregard the rest.
[23:38:39] <hooloovoo> pneftali: well
[23:38:43] <hooloovoo> lots of ways to do that
[23:38:52] <hooloovoo> but i think jquery has a .once() function
[23:39:13] <hooloovoo> guess not
[23:39:16] <hooloovoo> anyways
[23:39:35] <pneftali> how do you trap the clicks ?
[23:39:36] <systemfault> There's .one iirc
[23:39:54] <hooloovoo> not in the docs =/
[23:40:03] <pneftali> http://api.jquery.com/one/
[23:40:22] <pneftali> testing
[23:40:28] <hooloovoo> oh lookie
[23:41:46] <maja> Hello, i am having a problem with capturing events after i replace the div's content
[23:42:03] <maja> every thing works till i replace the controling input
[23:43:36] <pneftali> hooloovoo: yeah it works, problem is unless i do a full page refresh, the button is disabled :D
[23:43:47] <pneftali> after the first click that is
[23:47:22] <pneftali> checking unbind
[23:50:53] <hooloovoo> pneftali: Eh? you still want the click event to be inactive even after a page refresh
[23:51:03] <hooloovoo> if it's already been pressed
[23:51:38] <pneftali> bind/unbind is not what i need... :c
[23:51:45] <pneftali> hooloovoo: no
[23:52:36] <pneftali> hooloovoo: the button calls an ajax request. and takes sometime to finish. so i need to take in 1 click at a time.
[23:53:24] <hooloovoo> pneftali: then you should disable the click on the on the click event and then enable it on the ajax callback
[23:58:03] <pneftali> hooloovoo: ok will try that one
