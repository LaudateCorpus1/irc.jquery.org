[00:17:12] <alexweissman> would it be a bad design practice, to design a plugin that accepts a promise as a configuration option?
[00:17:50] <alexweissman> I'd like to give consumers of the API the opportunity to set a condition under which a particular asynchronous action is carried out
[00:18:06] <alexweissman> (in this case, submitting an AJAX request)
[00:18:45] <alexweissman> so my thinking is that consumers of the API can pass a promise as an option, and then the plugin will only execute the AJAX request once that promise is resolved
