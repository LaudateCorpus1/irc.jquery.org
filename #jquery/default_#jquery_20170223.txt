[00:41:02] <WhirledPress> Does anyone know if you can animate in vw units?
[00:41:56] <Uhku> volkswagen units?
[00:42:30] <WhirledPress> viewport widths
[00:52:04] <linuxson> Ok....stupid question time. When creating a new Java application in IntelliJ IDEA editor, can I add jquery language support to the project? And how would I "include" the jquery file in the Main.java file? Is that even possible?
[02:37:05] <rhizome> WhirledPress: sorry yes, but still only needs to be done once as a guard
[04:28:34] <mareosa> Hi guys, its possible to apply the effect explode to a background img instead an <img> ?
[04:48:03] <Cork> morlenxus: no, the effect depends on dom elements
[04:48:16] <Cork> you can explode the element with the background image though
[05:07:47] <mareosa> Cork, i want to apply the explode to this img http://luxuria-s.com/index_prize_new
[05:08:12] <mareosa> right now it "shows" the explode (all black) and then show the background image
[05:08:48] <Cork> mareosa: you would have to add the image to a separate element
[05:08:57] <Cork> you can't explode body as it can only ever be one body element
[05:09:17] <Cork> so you can add a <div> for example with the background image and explode that div
[05:09:37] <mareosa> im using that (i think)
[05:09:45] <Cork> what explode does is clone the element and create 8 copies of it and then animate those
[05:09:49] <mareosa> <div id="prize"></div>
[05:10:22] <Cork> ah so you just want to animate the "BD" image not the background?
[05:10:40] <Cork> then sure you can use explode on that
[05:13:18] <mareosa> yes, i want to animae the bd prize but that image is set with css (background)
[05:14:17] <Cork> ya, so animate the div like i said
[05:15:42] <mareosa> shouldnt this be ennough ?
[05:15:47] <mareosa> $( "#prize" ).show( "explode" , { pieces: 64 } , 2000);
[05:15:57] <Cork> ya
[05:16:38] <mareosa> problem, it shows the effect with the background black and after it shows the image
[05:22:16] <PhpNoob> hi
[05:22:51] <PhpNoob> there is any plugin for transfer item like that :http://viralpatel.net/blogs/listbox-select-all-move-left-right-up-down-javascript/
[05:22:59] <PhpNoob> please tell me
[05:24:23] <mareosa> Any ideas Cork ?
[05:24:38] <MACscr> Hmm, im having a problem setting default content for my editor and then passing it back to my visual editor. http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/w0tLy4rd/47/
[05:25:32] <MACscr> i think its an issue with the quotes within my default content
[05:27:24] <MACscr> but im not sure if im passing the content correctly. Maybe i should pass it to the val() of the textarea?
[05:28:01] <MACscr> but that doesnt work either, but not sure if that has to do with the content again
[06:09:52] <jomofcw> Hello !
[06:15:19] <mareosa> Cork still there ?
[06:55:06] <WhirledPress> MACscr, what is the problem?
[06:57:11] <WhirledPress> Does anyone know of a library that allows draggable to prevent collisions?
[06:57:45] <stennowork> that sounds complex
[06:58:08] <WhirledPress> jQuery UI Draggable Collision : https://sourceforge.net/projects/jquidragcollide/
[06:58:15] <MACscr> WhirledPress http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/49/. When I set default content of the textarea, and then click on "Update Visual", it seems to create a new empty pub_element. So instead of the 3 that i should get, it get 4
[06:58:55] <MACscr> and when i click on Update HTML, it creates a bunch of spaces in the code
[06:59:05] <MACscr> and a blank again
[06:59:18] <WhirledPress> MACscr, the problem with your generator in general is that it automatically wraps every element in a pub_element
[06:59:32] <stennowork> who in their right mind still hosts their projects on SF :v
[06:59:44] <WhirledPress> So when it generates the html, you got a bunch of pub_elements
[07:00:13] <MACscr> WhirledPress didnt you write that? =P
[07:00:34] <WhirledPress> you wrote that, I just made it go back and forth for ya
[07:01:15] <WhirledPress> What's happening is that as it splits elements apart, it's adding \r to make the lines easier to read
[07:03:30] <WhirledPress> and what is .getValue() ?
[07:04:46] <WhirledPress> and CodeMirror?
[07:05:14] <MACscr> WhirledPress CodeMirror is the syntax highlighter plugin
[07:05:40] <MACscr> im open to other plugins if you recommend something simpler
[07:06:02] <MACscr> its a bit off on its highlight too as it looks like it thinks there is a syntax issue
[07:06:03] <MACscr> when there isnt
[07:17:24] <MACscr> actually i figured that part out, its a mode issue
[07:17:42] <MACscr> but thats literally just a looks issue, not the problem with the wrapping
[07:18:55] <MACscr> WhirledPress http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/50/, updated and also removed the \r, but no diffence
[07:19:09] <MACscr> when it comes to the extra pub_element
[07:55:29] <MACscr> WhirledPress this might not be the most efficient in the way im doing make_modifiable(), but it seems to make everything work this way http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/52/
[07:55:34] <MACscr> and less code
[08:00:30] <MACscr> nevermind, this http://jsfiddle.net/w0tLy4rd/53/
[08:09:02] <printForever> Cork:
[08:09:11] <printForever> I'm going to flush_dns someone
[08:09:32] <printForever> why the hell isn't onclick="event.preventDefault;" not working
[08:32:14] <WhirledPress> MACscr, here is your code with all the comments in it and names standardized/consistent. With line by line explanation of what I did...
[08:32:17] <WhirledPress> http://jsfiddle.net/Whirl3d/w0tLy4rd/55/
[08:32:54] <WhirledPress> the visual stage and the editor stage sync back and forth correctly.
[08:33:25] <WhirledPress> the problem is that you can't "beautify" code in the editor and expect it to cleanly be added to the visual
[08:34:20] <MACscr> the editor is missing from your version
[08:35:23] <MACscr> but with mine, it all works (minus indentions) and way less code
[08:35:24] <WhirledPress> did you add elements and updateHTML
[08:35:35] <MACscr> yes
[08:36:06] <WhirledPress> That's it. I'm out. the only reason mine looks like a lot of code is that I commented every line and made it easy for you to read. LOL
[08:36:21] <WhirledPress> good luck with your project.
[08:36:27] <MACscr> WhirledPress no, i get that and i really appreciate the help
[08:36:56] <MACscr> i guess i just dont understand the benefits of your code versus mine when im losing functionality and gaining more code
[08:41:03] <MACscr> anyway, hope you dont think im disagreeing with you. Just trying to learn. Thanks again and have a great day!
[08:43:14] <momomo> is there a findfirst for jquery?
[08:43:26] <momomo> that returns on the first found element rather than trying to return a complete list ?
[08:43:28] <momomo> for instance
[08:43:36] <momomo> div.find('> .child')
[08:44:57] <jomofcw> How would you do to turn an inline list in desktop mode (like this : https://jsfiddle.net/fLmj9toh/) into a "on by one element, swip left/right to see next/previous item" on mobile, please ? Is there a known "plugin" or "core" ? I'm using Foundation in addition to jQuery. Please ?
[08:45:50] <MACscr> momomo if it returns an object, couldnt you just use the first value?
[08:46:30] <momomo> yes, but it is not optimal
[08:47:12] <momomo> if you have hundred elements, which are unique within the parent, jquery will search all of them to get just the one ... rather than return the first found one
[08:47:25] <MACscr> understand
[08:57:13] <Koopz> anyone using DataTables? the visible flag doesn't hide the desired column for some reason
[09:00:45] <fission6> how do i grab all options in a select and store them, while removing all the options under the select, so that i can maniauple the stored ones and push them back under the select

[09:22:08] <Woet> Duikb00t: what did you google for so far?
[09:24:49] <Duikb00t> figured it out Woet

[10:31:10] <hlve> wrong channel, sorry.
[11:08:43] <WhirledPress> http://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/oZNYVq  why are the arrow buttons incrementing by 4
[11:12:14] <juinn> can someone help here...how can i get values of td in a loop please? https://jsfiddle.net/3schveLL/
[11:13:24] <taplar> var td should be var tr, and you'll have to find('td') off of it
[11:13:37] <taplar> or children()
[11:19:22] <juinn> taplar: thank you
[11:27:49] * hlve slaps taplar with a trout.
[11:28:13] <taplar> you sure like that trout
[11:29:30] <hlve> trout is mighty delicious
[11:30:22] <taplar> WhirledPress: can you describe your issue further?  i'm not clear on what is incrementing by 4
[12:17:45] <MikeD_> WhirledPress: I don't see any incrementing at all
[12:17:56] <MikeD_> each click moves the slider to the next/previous
[12:30:13] <KristjanEst> hi. I just created a website. If somebody want's to chat with me via e-mail, then she/he can find my contacts from my homepage: http://web.zone.ee/kristjanrobam/
[12:30:30] <robertmaxrees> KristjanEst did you need help?
[12:30:36] <taplar> uh, what does that have to do with jquery
[12:30:45] <robertmaxrees> ^ heh
[12:30:53] <mendi> that's a very nice wesbite Kristjan!
[12:30:54] <dreh> he's spammed it in a few other channels as well
[12:30:56] <mendi> nevermind lol

[12:31:25] <ozcanesen> Hello, i am trying to do csrf protection for static html page with ajax calls, my plan is to get csrf token with ajax request and put them into ajax post requests, but since page contains many requests can i do this with $.ajaxPrefilter
[12:31:32] <ozcanesen> can i do ajax call in ajaxPrefilter?
[12:32:30] <ozcanesen> since ajax requests are async so how i am going to use ajax call in ajaxPrefilter callback :S i am confused
[12:32:46] <taplar> iirc post requests are less of an issue with csrf
[12:32:56] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:33:04] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/22063821/923919
[12:33:46] <robertmaxrees> also: just make sure CORS is enabled for your domain.
[12:34:05] <taplar> and if you really want to fk up csrf things, put confirmations on the important parts
[12:34:34] * taplar grins as he remembers back to his owasp stuff
[12:35:23] <ozcanesen> robertmaxrees, yes i am trying same approach but i am confused about getCSRFTokenValue() function because this function will get token from web service asynchronous
[12:35:37] <ozcanesen> so this line will not work  xhr.setRequestHeader('X-CSRF-Token', getCSRFTokenValue());
[12:36:14] <robertmaxrees> why are you doing this for each individual request?
[12:36:39] <robertmaxrees> why not just one request token per page?
[12:36:56] <ozcanesen> robertmaxrees, aww right
[12:37:02] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:38:38] <ozcanesen> robertmaxrees, i am not sure if django middleware going the handle this correctly though, i am going to check
[12:38:44] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:38:52] <robertmaxrees> just inject a token into the page as a js var.
[12:38:54] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[12:39:30] <ozcanesen> robertmaxrees, how often token changes? is it per session?
[12:40:04] <taplar> what is generating the token?
[12:40:22] <robertmaxrees> http://security.stackexchange.com/a/22936
[12:40:40] <robertmaxrees> read this.
[12:42:20] <ozcanesen> taplar, i am using django in backend, django generates token for me
[12:42:41] <taplar> a csrf token in addition to your auth token?
[12:44:36] <ozcanesen> taplar, what is auth token?
[12:45:06] <taplar> auth tokens are tokens you get after you login, which are used for checking if your session has expired or not
[12:45:56] <taplar> since you don't want to store username and password and resend it every time to check this
[12:46:30] <ozcanesen> taplar, ah yes i understand. in django i think there is two seperate cookies one for auth and one for csrf
[12:46:38] <taplar> good deal
[12:47:05] <ozcanesen> ah actually i can read csrf cookie with js and there is no need to additional request
[12:47:11] <robertmaxrees> fwiw https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/csrf/
[12:47:22] <robertmaxrees> this talks about how to handle csrf via django.
[12:47:29] <robertmaxrees> which does it per page.
[12:47:38] <taplar> you should consider the httpOnly setting to if you are concerned with security
[12:48:10] <robertmaxrees> and make sure CORS is enabled.
[12:48:19] <ozcanesen> taplar, auth token is httponly but csrf is not
[12:48:33] <taplar> you said it was a cookie
[12:49:19] <ozcanesen> sorry i need to leave now brb, thank you guys
[12:49:56] <juinn> are you using php to verify csrf token?
[12:50:01] <robertmaxrees> djano.
[12:50:06] <robertmaxrees> so python :)
[12:50:29] <juinn> ok i'll keep my mouth shut then :)
[12:50:31] <WhirledPress> is this accurate for select all links pointing to a section?     var sect=$("#somesection"); var lnks=$("a[href*='#"+sect.prop('id')+"']"));
[12:50:33] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:50:53] <robertmaxrees> 'ew.
[12:51:39] <robertmaxrees> links = $('a').filter(functoon(){ return this.href === sect.prop('id') });
[12:51:43] <robertmaxrees> or something like that.
[12:51:55] <MikeD_> robertmaxrees: fyi - i finally discovered the problem with keyup  :  https://jsfiddle.net/ur333Ltz/1/
[12:52:06] <WhirledPress> that's better? ok. Righton. thanks.
[12:52:16] <MikeD_> it's actually a problem with .val() and input type="number"
[12:52:27] <robertmaxrees> favor filter instead of sizzle.
[12:52:29] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ huh?
[12:52:35] <robertmaxrees> no clue what you're referencing.
[12:52:37] <taplar> WhirledPress: you could stick the section in as a class if you wanted to to make it much smaller
[12:52:59] <MikeD_> yesterday I thought i was having timing problems or weirdness with .val() in keyup
[12:53:41] <MikeD_> input type="number" don't have .val() unless the content of the input is a valid number
[12:53:49] <WhirledPress> taplar, how so?
[12:54:07] <taplar> <a href="#theSection"  class="theSection">
[12:54:28] <taplar> var links = $('.'+ sect.prop('id') )
[12:54:36] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_ fwiw https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ur333Ltz/2/
[12:54:45] <robertmaxrees> that's an underlying thing, nto a jquery thing.
[12:55:08] <WhirledPress> I just realized that I had used ids for that. links=$("#"+sect.prop('id')+"_lnk");
[12:55:15] <WhirledPress> thanks.
[12:55:37] <taplar> wut?
[12:55:38] <MikeD_> yeah, understood - now :)  but man did I waste a lot of time to discover what probably is actually in the spec
[12:56:01] <robertmaxrees> iw ouldn't say that's a problem.
[12:56:34] <MikeD_> right.  not a problem.  an "opportunity" to RTFM
[12:56:50] <robertmaxrees> haha
[12:56:57] <taplar> (╥﹏╥)

[12:59:09] <taplar> lol
[12:59:34] <KristjanEst> hey
[12:59:40] <taplar> hola ˁ˚ᴥ˚ˀ
[12:59:42] <KristjanEst> why i can't join #chat?
[12:59:57] <KristjanEst> what do i have to do for that?
[12:59:57] <taplar> is your account registered and are you authorized to it?
[13:00:00] <KristjanEst> yes
[13:00:33] <taplar> that room doesn't exist
[13:00:37] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:00:41] <taplar> as per the mesage from ##namespace
[13:00:42] <robertmaxrees> you're probably not reg'd.
[13:00:55] <taplar> [##namespace] You've been forwarded to ##namespace by attempting to join a channel which doesn't exist on freenode. This may be because the channel has moved to the correct namespace or off the network. Please see https://freenode.net/policies for our channel naming policy.
[13:00:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd go to ##freenode for any other support questions w/r/t freenode and irc.
[13:02:04] <MikeD_> but #foo does exist
[13:02:57] <taplar> true.  ?
[13:03:29] <MikeD_> i expect that it's a metasyntactic channel where the only discussion is about discussion itself
[13:03:39] <MikeD_> or a placeholder for other interactions
[13:25:25] <taplar> such a rollercoaster.  robomongo just added replica set support to it, and we can't get it to work :s
[14:27:39] <arfnarfstarf> is .val() susceptible to XSS?
[14:28:05] <taplar> huh?
[14:29:00] <arfnarfstarf> $("input").val(<value_from_query_string>); --> is that an attack vector for cross site scripting?
[14:29:25] <arfnarfstarf> could someone then put something in the query string that causes javascript to run on the page?
[14:29:44] <taplar> oooooh
[14:30:03] <taplar> val() sets the value property on an element
[14:30:14] <robertmaxrees> could give it a shot in a fiddle.
[14:30:36] <taplar> i'm not thinking of a case where val() would cause script to run
[14:30:38] <arfnarfstarf> hard to proove a negative
[14:30:50] <arfnarfstarf> *prove
[14:33:50] <taplar> what query string, btw?
[14:34:35] <arfnarfstarf> that's kind of the question, could be anything.
[14:35:08] <taplar> wut?
[14:35:33] <arfnarfstarf> the value of the query string could be anything
[14:35:49] <taplar> what are you reffering to as a query string?
[14:36:10] <taplar> are you saying it's coming from a database?  or are you saying it's coming from the url?
[14:36:25] <arfnarfstarf> url
[14:37:10] <taplar> i can't think of how val() would cause script to run, but regardless you should clean your data before you put it on your page
[14:37:16] <taplar> clean and encode
[14:37:20] <taplar> if it can possibly execute
[14:38:18] <arfnarfstarf> Good idea
[14:38:31] <arfnarfstarf> I'm looking for answer if it can ever execute
[15:07:47] <MassDebates> taplar I scrolled up but I don't understand
[15:08:08] <taplar> you and me both brosef
[15:08:20] <MassDebates> taplar:  Aren't there ways to clean or sanitize it that are really easy?
[15:08:25] <MassDebates> Like you can set a variable too
[15:08:27] <MassDebates> right?
[15:08:28] <taplar> heh, watcha talkin about
[15:08:42] <MassDebates> He was worried about cross site scripting, no?
[15:08:52] <taplar> you can use text() instead of html() to encode stuff
[15:08:56] <MassDebates> Right.
[15:09:05] <MassDebates> .val() isn't safe though
[15:09:08] <MassDebates> But what about var =
[15:09:12] <taplar> how so?
[15:09:13] <MassDebates> with the .val()
[15:09:18] <MassDebates> Uh
[15:09:46] <MassDebates> Because it's easy to interrupt any flow that the XSS attempt might have used to connect the chain and commit its crimes?
[15:09:57] <taplar> huh?
[15:10:08] <taplar> the point of xss is to execute script to do stuff, right?
[15:10:23] <MassDebates> Well, I was thinking to prevent it. I don't know why someone would want to allow that.
[15:10:26] <MassDebates> Or even encourage it...
[15:10:33] <MassDebates> Here's what I think of when I see it
[15:10:35] <taplar> how will val() execute script?
[15:11:02] <MassDebates> <a tag is here> <another tag is here> <inputtable slot that self closes /> </another tag being here> </a tag being here>
[15:11:08] <MassDebates> Say this pseudo markup was a target
[15:11:12] <taplar> that's markup.  val() changes the dom
[15:11:23] <MassDebates> I haven't gotten to the script yet lol
[15:11:50] <MassDebates> shoot hold on #css needs help
[15:11:59] <MassDebates> I'll jsut make a codepen
[15:12:02] <MassDebates> and then have you look at it.
[15:13:22] <taplar> looking at the source you can give val() a function and it will execute it.  but coming off of the url it wouldn't be a function
[15:13:31] <d2k> taplar: Dear taplar, thanks for your help yesterday, you were totally right, I just needed to load "moment-with-locales.min.js" and then set "moment.locale('es');" in a document.ready function. Thanks a lot for the guiding!
[15:14:00] <taplar> cool, though if i might suggest you might want to try the one without locales and then load the specific one you need.
[15:14:08] <taplar> since the one with locales has them all, and might be considered bloated
[15:14:38] <d2k> taplar: the only problem I have now is that something like Monday, in spanish "Lunes" is written "lunes" ...that's strange but who cares ;)
[15:16:30] <d2k> taplar: So I'm considering to download the CND source and manually translate the stuff from english to spanish. This then could also be called a solution. It's just a bit sad that the word outputs come without capital first letters
[15:17:59] <taplar> https://github.com/moment/moment/blob/develop/locale/es.js
[15:18:38] <taplar> try downloading the non-locales moment.js and that file, change that one to have caps wherever you want, and try loading both of those and see what you come up with
[15:18:42] <d2k> taplar: You are recommending me to load that script after the other?
[15:18:51] <taplar> yeah, just load what you need
[15:19:05] <d2k> taplar: Ok, I will report if it worked well :)
[15:27:03] <taplar> that is interesting.  they are capitalized in other locales
[15:28:40] <taplar> http://www.spanishdict.com/answers/181002/do-months-need-to-be-capitalized-in-spanish     interesting
[15:28:56] <d2k> taplar: Yes, it would be more flexi-fitting with capitalized first letters, who knows what they were thinking. Trying your approch now, brb
[15:29:45] <d2k> taplar: I mean, your link says no capitalization for spanish date names but it looks strange
[15:30:05] <taplar> Are you saying that as a native speaker/
[15:30:06] <taplar> ?
[15:30:22] <d2k> taplar: No, i'm a german stuck in south america ;)
[15:30:29] <taplar> so....... :)
[15:30:55] <d2k> taplar: but from a designers point of view capitalization goes over correct spelling
[15:31:14] <d2k> taplar: You cannot start a text line saying: monday
[15:31:23] <taplar> are you ready for spanish people to contact you going "Why is this capitalized?  It's weird"
[15:31:37] <taplar> in spanish of course
[15:31:43] <arosen> Is it possible to use jquery as a dom parser by feeding it a string of text? i.e without having to add those elements to the screen?
[15:31:51] <taplar> arosen: yes
[15:32:07] <taplar> arosen: though jQuery will eat html and head tags iirc
[15:32:09] <d2k> taplar: It is ok that spanish does not capitalize but first letter should, maybe with CSS, thanks for mentioning, CSS would be nice for that
[15:32:35] <arosen> taplar:  how would one do that say from like: $.get('http://foo.com/', function(data) { // i want to know be able to parse data }
[15:32:48] <taplar> var $stuff = $(data)
[15:33:14] <arosen> ah thanks :)
[15:33:57] <taplar> is foo.com a complete webpage?
[15:34:05] <taplar> or a fragment?
[15:34:06] <arosen> yes
[15:34:13] <arosen> it would return an html page.
[15:34:15] <d2k> taplar: done, so with CSS it was that simple to fix: #displayMoment::first-letter{text-transform:capitalize}
[15:34:18] <taplar> you should avoid that if possible.  jQuery isn't meant to house an entire dom
[15:34:18] <arosen> http://foo.com/index.html
[15:34:29] <taplar> as i mentioned with it eating tags
[15:34:38] <taplar> d2k: cool
[15:34:52] <d2k> taplar: Thanks for mentioning that spanish should be spanish to avoid discussion with spanish lovers :D
[15:34:59] <taplar> lol
[15:35:10] <taplar> i mean, what is weird to us.... *shrug*
[15:35:55] <d2k> taplar: Yeah, totally weird ...I like spanish but it's very frustrating, has so many pseudo-rules ;)
[15:36:12] <d2k> taplar: And so much "non-global"
[15:36:16] <d2k> taplar: ;)
[15:36:32] <taplar> i'm sure they find english slang weird too
[15:39:02] <d2k> it is, for a german english is strange, so many small written things, that's why germans always looks for the first letter. But the first letter of a text should be big, even in spanish ...CSS is awesome :)
[15:40:32] <WhirledPress> http://codepen.io/jaseinatl/pen/oZNYVq?editors=1010
[15:40:58] <WhirledPress> could someone help me get the navigation menu to work correctly. The current highlight box is not lining up correctly.
[15:43:49] <d2k> taplar: can you help with another small thing ...I want to separate date and time having them in two divs. Heres a fiddle: https://jsfiddle.net/mLgbdLch/21/
[15:43:59] <d2k> taplar: Date and time into two divs would be perfect
[15:44:21] <WhirledPress> I set the width of my highlight box to the outerwidth of the element, height to outerHeight, and left to the left position and it doesn't line up or match.
[15:44:58] <taplar> d2k: why not break your format a part into two pieces then?
[15:45:52] <d2k> taplar: a \n like break would do the job. Separating is another option, I will try it, if I fail I might show you with what I came up with
[15:51:41] <taplar> WhirledPress: adding +10 to the left seems to make it look nicer.  not sure right now how you'd determine that logically
[15:51:58] <jak2000> taplar!!!
[15:52:01] <jak2000> hi friend
[15:52:05] <jak2000> wich is your GMT?
[15:52:08] <WhirledPress> Actually, adding padding to the marker worked finally. Thanks for your help.
[15:52:45] <taplar> i'm CST
[15:53:08] <d2k> taplar: So I tried the following but I think something is wrong: https://jsfiddle.net/mLgbdLch/26/
[15:53:57] <taplar> i think you are confusing your date and time variables
[15:54:03] <WhirledPress> I am using vw as my unit for responsive spacing. But how do I tell jquery that I want the outerWidth in vw terms?
[15:54:08] <d2k> taplar: I see
[15:54:19] <jak2000> mine is GMT -7 you?
[15:54:34] <taplar> WhirledPress: not sure that you can.  iirc it's just going to get units of pixels
[15:54:43] <taplar> -6 or something
[15:55:00] <d2k> WhirledPress: You might overwrite it with DOM or !important to use VW unit
[15:55:01] <jak2000> mmmm similar to me
[15:55:07] <jak2000> you live in europe right?
[15:55:13] <jak2000> your gmt would be +6
[15:55:15] <jak2000> so so
[15:55:21] <taplar> -6
[15:55:24] <taplar> not +
[15:55:28] <taplar> usa
[15:56:40] <d2k> taplar: Not sure if I'm thinking right here: https://jsfiddle.net/mLgbdLch/29/
[15:57:00] <d2k> taplar: I have some problems with javascript logics, since 20 years :D
[15:57:23] <jak2000> how to hidde a column of a html table if i have defined a class on the column on th and td?
[15:57:31] <taplar> look at line 7 and line 9
[15:57:38] <taplar> what is the variable 'dateit' ?
[15:58:18] <d2k> taplar: dateit should just show the date, that was the idea behind it, not sure if this could be done that way
[15:58:35] <taplar> line 7 you are storing the result of moment() in dateit
[15:58:41] <taplar> so it's a momentjs object
[15:58:52] <taplar> but line 9 you are trying to do dateit.html()
[15:58:58] <taplar> html() is a what method?
[15:59:34] <d2k> html is for outputting as html string
[15:59:48] <taplar> what does html belong to?
[16:00:20] <taplar> if i wanted to look at the api documentation for html(), where would i go?
[16:00:58] <d2k> taplar: good question, I will try to find something on the moments.js documentation.
[16:01:14] <taplar> no, that's my point.  it's not a momentjs function
[16:01:19] <taplar> html() is a jquery method
[16:01:24] <d2k> taplar: html is not need, If I get a good output I could also avoid using html
[16:01:42] <d2k> taplar: Ah ok, I think I understand
[16:02:58] <taplar> variable A = moment();  variable B = A.format(date format);  variable C = A.format(time format); then put B and C on the page
[16:06:06] <d2k> taplar: implementing your solution. One moment, I'm a bit slow with javascript
[16:12:01] <taplar> jak2000: i'd think you just select them and hide them
[16:14:14] <jak2000> <th class="clhuerta">Huerta</th>
[16:14:34] <jak2000> $(".clhuerta").hide();
[16:14:35] <jak2000> not hide
[16:14:40] <jak2000> would be....
[16:15:29] <d2k> taplar: Got it! Thanks a lot!!! Heres the result: https://jsfiddle.net/mLgbdLch/38/
[16:16:15] <d2k> taplar: Is this all correct like that?
[16:16:17] <taplar> d2k: cool, but what's up with A?
[16:16:35] <d2k> taplar: Good question lol
[16:17:16] <d2k> taplar: What do I miss for A?
[16:17:37] <taplar> no, i'm asking why you have it.  you set it to moment and then you null it out.  not used any where
[16:18:00] <d2k> taplar: Roger, I will take it out and see if it works without it.
[16:18:22] <d2k> taplar: Uhm yeah, A was for nothing
[16:18:32] <d2k> taplar: Solved! :)
[16:18:37] <taplar> :)
[16:19:34] <taplar> jak2000: wut?
[16:24:15] <d2k> taplar: This is the finest date/time in the world. Moments.js is a lovely thing. I found it because it was part of SimpleWeather.js and simpleWeather.js calls itself the best jquery in the world :)
[16:25:34] <taplar> cool
[16:26:00] <jak2000> COOL
[16:35:13] <d2k> Hasta luego jQuery Gods. Always a pleasure to talk with you. Greetings to Robertmaxrees and thank you soo much taplar for always beeing such a great help! Till next time :)
[16:35:20] <robertmaxrees> hah
[16:35:22] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[16:35:55] <taplar> that taplar guys a jerk
[16:36:30] <robertmaxrees> total
[16:36:35] <d2k> that taplar guys saved my bottom more than once!!! It's love!!! ;)
[16:36:54] <d2k> also counts for that robertmaxrees guy
[16:38:10] <d2k> it's like I wanna make a altar and pray to you guys when I wake up and before I go to sleep. Just that :)
[16:38:49] <d2k> Dear taplar, dear robertmaxrees, make this another great jQuery day, please. Amen!
[16:39:59] <taplar> exorciseeeeeeeeeeee the datatables!!!
[16:40:10] <taplar> had to
[16:40:25] <d2k> Theres so many bad codes in the world, so much confusing, and developing is hard. Watch over me, taplar, robertmaxrees. In the name of the code, the parent element and the child
[16:40:34] <taplar> lmao
[16:41:03] <taplar> this is getting almost as bad as the cat puns that me and awkwardcough were tossing around the office earlier
[16:41:23] <robertmaxrees> Yea, and he said "I will help you .find() the way".  And he did.  And the $.ajax() calls were good.
[16:41:54] <d2k> ROFL
[16:43:56] <taplar> my mom taught me that i shouldn't bind my expectations, but i should delegate instead
[16:44:03] * taplar gives that one a 3/10
[16:44:14] <shoky_> :-o
[16:44:24] <d2k> that's funny thou
[16:44:37] <taplar> eh, it's kinda eventful
[16:45:03] <d2k> ah shoky there you are, also thanks to you!
[16:45:07] <taplar> what do you call a cat with a phat crib?
[16:45:28] <taplar> a hairballer
[16:45:40] <d2k> omg :D
[16:45:45] <taplar> no kitten
[16:45:59] <d2k> ah hairy pussycat
[16:46:16] <taplar> purrhapse
[16:46:21] <d2k> me don't have such thing, me nerd
[16:47:20] <d2k> but I do have a annoying cat that ruins codes by walking over the keyboard.
[16:47:38] <taplar> those guys are awesome
[16:49:02] <d2k> yeah, they suck :)
[16:49:42] <d2k> but this way I can have pussy
[16:49:45] <d2k> ...cat
[16:49:59] <taplar> aaaaand it got weird
[16:50:12] <taplar> ;)
[16:50:14] <d2k> yep, I agree, time to leave ...never mind :)
[16:50:17] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  little too far there heh.
[16:53:36] <d2k> If I should crap before I jQuery, I pray the taplar/robertmaxrees my soul to take.
[16:53:49] <taplar> wha?
[16:53:55] <robertmaxrees> wut
[16:53:56] <taplar> was that a typo?
[16:54:26] * taplar is cracking up
[16:54:39] <taplar> who doesn't crap before they jquery?
[16:55:02] <d2k> ok let's replace "crap" with "Offtopic"
[16:56:32] <d2k> nvm, germans have no good homour, they just don't get it and they cannot compete :D
[17:00:06] * d2k recommends back to ontopics to make this offtopic mess disappear from the scrollbar. I'm out, have a great time!
[17:00:08] <taplar> ah, that made my day
[17:03:17] <taplar> any news on the dam?
[17:03:49] <taplar> last i saw there were chances of more rain last week or something
[17:04:31] <d2k> afaik it disappered from the news, kinda solved like
[17:15:25] <robertmaxrees> not solved at all actually.
[17:15:25] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:15:44] <robertmaxrees> they're still repairing the auxillary spillway.  but things are far less dire than they were a while ago.
[17:16:24] <robertmaxrees> so long as we don't get surprise snowpack melt we should be good to go.
[17:16:46] <taplar> good deal
[17:18:08] <robertmaxrees> fwiw the emergency spillway was known to have problems and there was a requst to have it addressed like 10 years ago buuut you know how that goes.
[17:18:31] <taplar> government work
[17:18:52] <robertmaxrees> heh.
[17:19:21] <robertmaxrees> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Oroville_Dam_crisis this is actually a good rundown
[17:20:01] <Jesper__> Hey everyone! I need your help! :) First of all, a Fiddle of my code: https://jsfiddle.net/oyy3uuke/  Right now, I have a form that I try to submit via the jquery ajax method, to a php file - The php file then handles writing the content into a text file. When I use the form, I actually get the content created in my text file, however my ajax method call always reaches the fail() method, never the done()  I'm not really sure why that
[17:20:31] <Jesper__> it would be much appreciated
[17:20:36] <taplar> are you returning valid json?
[17:20:40] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:20:46] <robertmaxrees> try killing the datatype from there.
[17:20:50] <Jesper__> hmm
[17:21:11] <Jesper__> I thought the datatype defined what I was sending, not what is returned? Am I mistaken here?
[17:21:47] <robertmaxrees> you are mistaken :)
[17:21:53] <taplar> that's contentType
[17:21:53] <robertmaxrees> it's the data you're expecting back.
[17:22:04] <Jesper__> oh, well that explains it then :)
[17:22:11] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ -> "The type of data that you're expecting back from the server."
[17:22:23] <Jesper__> Oh wow, my bad :) thanks for that guys
[17:22:29] <Jesper__> just gonna test it out, hopefully it will work
[17:23:27] <taplar> side question.  is there a reason the button element is not in the form?
[17:23:34] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
[17:24:00] <taplar> <button> by default performs a submit when in a form
[17:24:09] <Jesper__> @taplar uhm, not really - I just assumed that having my form consist of the data transmitted only, would be preferable
[17:24:19] <robertmaxrees> nah
[17:24:22] <robertmaxrees> stick the button in there.
[17:24:26] <Jesper__> ok :)
[17:24:26] <robertmaxrees> since it's a control for it.
[17:24:34] <robertmaxrees> data will be the same.
[17:24:37] <taplar> and it doesn't have a name so it cannot be sent
[17:25:04] <Jesper__> oh yeah, thats true
[17:27:42] <juinn> hey guys im attemping to make a plugin...all was well until i added line 103 https://jsfiddle.net/hzdfgvms/
[17:27:50] <juinn> can i get some help please
[17:28:16] <arosen> Is there anyway to avoid the double pair of $($()) in doing something like this: $($(data).find(".tags").get(0)).attr("data-ids")  ?
[17:28:40] <taplar> eq(0)
[17:28:43] <taplar> or first()
[17:28:54] <taplar> and use data(
[17:28:57] <taplar> data('id')
[17:29:02] <taplar> with an ssssss
[17:29:03] <taplar> lol
[17:29:33] <Jesper__> Ahh, much appreciated guys, thanks for the quick help :) Will probably stick around, might have more questions :)
[17:29:39] <robertmaxrees> definitely.
[17:29:39] <Jesper__> It works fine now
[17:30:31] <taplar> juinn: what does editable_table return?
[17:31:00] <juinn> it puts field inside td so you can edit
[17:31:13] <juinn> then save <--- which is to be a callback
[17:31:24] <arosen> taplar:  i still need to use find though ?
[17:31:25] <taplar> but what does the method return?
[17:31:25] <juinn> line 103 causing the error
[17:31:36] <taplar> arosen: yes
[17:31:46] <taplar> get(0) breaks out of the jquery object.  eq(0) does not
[17:32:24] <taplar> juinn: editable_table(...).save(...) assumes that editable_table returns an object to chain call save on
[17:32:54] <taplar> which if it is not..... *mimics explosion*
[17:33:07] <arosen> taplar:  $($(data).find(".tags").get(0)).attr("data-ids")   == $(data).find(".tags").eq(0).attr('data-ids')  ?
[17:33:17] <taplar> data('ids')
[17:33:20] <taplar> and yes
[17:33:57] <arosen> hrm, what's data('ids') ?
[17:34:12] <taplar> data() is a convenience method for accessing data-* elements
[17:35:17] <arosen> taplar:  thanks , that works (sorry had a typo in my code when i was testing what you were saying).
[17:35:17] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:35:18] <juinn> taplar: thank you for the hint :)
[17:36:37] <taplar> robertmaxrees: you know this wiki article is making me curious as to how a person goes about relocating a fish hatchery
[17:36:47] <juinn> could i also get some critique on the script so far... https://jsfiddle.net/wsdbh76q/     only my 2nd time attemping to make a plugin...advise would be appreciated
[17:37:24] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[17:37:31] <robertmaxrees> i actually know a guy who was involved with it!
[17:37:48] <taplar> juinn: you got some global variables in there
[17:37:57] <taplar> make sure variables are properly scoped with var or let
[17:37:57] <robertmaxrees> you literally just grab up the fish and relocate them.
[17:38:17] <juinn> so use var instead of $
[17:38:22] <taplar> with a regular net or do they have like a big net to just span the tanks?
[17:38:39] <taplar> $ doesn't have any logical affect on varialbes
[17:38:42] <robertmaxrees> that i don't know.
[17:38:57] <taplar> $ at the front of a variable name is just a naming pattern people use
[17:38:58] <robertmaxrees> juinn $somename is just a naming convention.
[17:39:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[17:39:20] <robertmaxrees> var/let/const actually declare variables.  here you're just using them without providing a scope for them.
[17:40:34] <juinn> sorry for my slowness...i find this hard to grasp....so i should just you var yes?
[17:40:35] <juinn> =/
[17:40:41] <taplar> i see a switch with only one case...
[17:41:24] <d2k> oh hey guys, i'm back with a new very very small issue. Why is this video not autoplaying ...also it seems a Fallback image is active, any hints? http://vinculo.com.py/infoscreens/smartslider/sliders/22/index.html
[17:42:04] <taplar> typeof field['attributes'] could be just typeof field.attributes, but that's a preference thing
[17:42:41] <juinn> taplar: swicth will include other field types...select
[17:42:46] <juinn> checkbox
[17:43:51] <juinn> so var $name = 'hello'
[17:44:07] <juinn> this is a var basically with a $ before-hand#
[17:44:08] <taplar> var name = 'hello'
[17:44:20] <taplar> 'hello' is a string.  not a jquery object
[17:44:37] <taplar> which is the point of using $, to signify that a variable does/should house a jquery object
[17:45:11] <taplar> var name = 'weeee'; var $tr = $('table').find('tr');
[17:46:00] <juinn> ahhh ok i see now
[17:46:06] <taplar> but as said before, it's just naming conventions.  if it makes sense to you, *shrug*
[17:46:11] <d2k> oh, it seems my video issue is a bug within Smart Slider 3. You can ignore my question. Thanks.
[17:46:35] <juinn> well im here to learn so lets stick with what is deemed right
[17:46:52] <taplar> 'right' in this case is fluid, ;)
[17:47:15] <taplar> 'conventional' would probably be better
[17:47:56] <juinn> tr is a object     would you call data {name: juinn} as object in that sense?
[17:48:22] <taplar> var thing = { name: 'juinn' };  //that's an object
[17:48:52] <taplar> pretty much everything in javascript is an object
[17:49:35] <taplar> it's just wither or not it has a standardized name
[17:53:05] <juinn> taplar: thank you for the help :)
[17:53:14] <taplar> sure
[18:02:00] <d2k> taplar: I like that var name = 'weeee'. Great stuff!
[18:02:13] <taplar> gotta have fun
[18:03:31] <d2k> I might name a var like that the next time when coding feels not fun :D
[18:05:10] <taplar> i'm out for the evening.  l8r all
[18:05:25] <d2k> taplar: Have a great evening!
[18:15:36] <Jesper__> I have an error message that is displayed if an error has occurred - My page consists of multiple div elements, that are hidden/shown when the user navigates the page. Is it possible to hide the error message, if any div element is hidden?
[18:16:00] <robertmaxrees> just add it into your js.
[18:16:18] <robertmaxrees> are these other divs hidden/shown on click or something?
[18:16:24] <Jesper__> yeah
[18:16:34] <Jesper__> All my pages are divs, that are shown/hidden, depending on user input
[18:16:37] <robertmaxrees> could use a delegated listener for those, too.
[18:16:43] <Jesper__> I just want to remove my error message, if the user changes to another page
[18:16:59] <robertmaxrees> just add it as apart of your page transition stuff.
[18:18:29] <Jesper__> okay, will do that - Was just wondering if I could put it on the error message instead, but I can do it the other way around - just wanted to avoid repeating code :)
[18:18:54] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:19:02] <robertmaxrees> you shouild have a generic page transition function,.
[18:19:36] <Jesper__> hm, I don't have that. We haven't used that so far in school - Do you have an example link or something you can show me of this?
[18:19:45] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[18:19:49] <Jesper__> heh :)
[18:19:55] <robertmaxrees> show me yer code.
[18:19:58] <robertmaxrees> it's a simple concept.
[18:20:03] <Jesper__> it's kinda big :S
[18:20:12] <robertmaxrees> just a few of the page transition stuff.
[18:21:12] <Jesper__> sec
[18:22:50] <juinn> guys if i press edit and save i get an error...callback not set...but it has been set   https://jsfiddle.net/wzr99bbn/
[18:23:30] <robertmaxrees> what's the error?
[18:23:37] <juinn> console
[18:23:52] <robertmaxrees> ooor you could just tell me ;)
[18:24:27] <robertmaxrees> uhm.
[18:24:27] <juinn> robertmaxrees: line 39 the error is throw from
[18:24:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:24:41] <robertmaxrees> so where you do set save_callback?
[18:24:56] <Jesper__> @robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/8ro10hs5/ Hope this is enough to illustrate it, else just ask
[18:25:43] <robertmaxrees> Jesper__ so where in here do you do the logic to take them to a new section? $(document).on("click", ".link", function() { ?
[18:26:28] <robertmaxrees> save_callback
[18:26:28] <Jesper__> Yeah, that is used for generic page links
[18:26:32] <robertmaxrees> woops.
[18:26:48] <robertmaxrees> Jesper__ but that's where that logic happens, right?
[18:26:59] <juinn> set callback at line 108
[18:27:15] <Jesper__> Uhm.. yeah, I guess :)
[18:27:23] <robertmaxrees> Jesper__ soooo....
[18:27:28] <robertmaxrees> why not just hide the alert in there?
[18:27:33] <robertmaxrees> jugglinmike1 newp.
[18:27:38] <robertmaxrees> wooooops bad autocomplete
[18:27:48] <robertmaxrees> juinn this.save isn't what you think it is there.
[18:27:54] <Jesper__> I could do that, but it's not all pages that uses the link functionality, there are some pages that have their own
[18:28:10] <robertmaxrees> Jesper__ what do those look like?
[18:28:10] <Jesper__> but I guess I could just hide it in their logic aswell
[18:28:45] <robertmaxrees> Jesper__ why not have them all work through that one handler?
[18:29:00] <Jesper__> Because some have specific requirements
[18:29:06] <Jesper__> hold on I'll update the fiddle
[18:29:08] <robertmaxrees> heh
[18:29:28] <juinn> robertmaxrees: what do you mean? =/
[18:29:38] <juinn> robertmaxrees: i can't see the problem to be honest
[18:29:48] <Jesper__> @robertmaxrees well, actually you can see it on the create user logic in the javascript
[18:30:13] <robertmaxrees> Jesper__ so $("#btn-create-user").click( function() { ?
[18:30:14] <Jesper__> @robertmaxrees for creating users, I also need to do an ajax post request
[18:30:21] <Jesper__> @robertmaxrees jes
[18:30:26] <Jesper__> yes*
[18:31:01] <robertmaxrees> Jesper__ where in there are you "changing the page"?
[18:31:26] <Jesper__> I'm not currently, because I was testing with the user creation
[18:31:39] <Jesper__> but I guess I could just call the other function and hide it there
[18:32:02] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you could create a single function for just changing the page and then call that wherever you need it.
[18:32:09] <robertmaxrees> pass in what needs to be shown, etc.
[18:32:13] <Jesper__> yeah okay
[18:32:18] <Jesper__> thats probably the best approach
[18:32:26] <Jesper__> Thanks man :)
[18:32:58] <robertmaxrees> juinn so - what do you this 'this' is in your this.save ?
[18:34:55] <juinn> i want to be able to set a callback...when i click on save the callback will be called
[18:35:02] <robertmaxrees> ...
[18:35:06] <Jesper__> @robertmaxrees yeah, this works perfectly now - Thanks for the logical approach :)
[18:35:15] <robertmaxrees> Jesper__ definitely!
[18:36:09] <robertmaxrees> juinn also: why not just pass it in the object?
[18:36:20] <robertmaxrees> instead of as a separate jquery method?
[18:36:50] <juinn> ummm save will be a ajax request probably...also you never know how big a function it may be
[18:36:55] <robertmaxrees> so?
[18:36:58] <juinn> thought it was a good idea
[18:37:00] <robertmaxrees> newp.
[18:37:12] <robertmaxrees> you wanna minimize your footprint on the jquery object.
[18:37:25] <robertmaxrees> attaching a .save() is a great way to really confuse and piss people off.
[18:37:44] <juinn> ok so i put it in with config
[18:37:46] <juinn> :)
[18:37:47] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[18:37:49] <juinn> ty
[18:38:16] <juinn> any other good tips pointers?...im a no0b and its my second plugin so advise would be great
[18:38:33] <robertmaxrees> } else if (!('id' in options)) { this pattern is weird.
[18:38:51] <robertmaxrees> and use dot notation when accessing properties.
[18:39:41] <juinn> i want to make sure id is set in config....also im using dot notions?
[18:39:48] <robertmaxrees> columns = options['columns'],
[18:39:55] <robertmaxrees> use columns = options.columns, instead.
[18:39:59] <juinn> ahh ok
[18:40:11] <robertmaxrees> also: what's with the state vars in tyhere?
[18:40:16] <robertmaxrees> like data = null?
[18:40:42] <juinn> just data; ?
[18:40:53] <robertmaxrees> why is it there at all?
[18:41:14] <juinn> where should it be?
[18:41:22] <robertmaxrees> well, where is data coming from?
[18:41:38] <robertmaxrees> i don't see where you set it.
[18:42:30] <robertmaxrees> also: putting $(".edit").click(function() { within your plugin is a great way to get me to uninstall it.
[18:42:37] <juinn> umm havent gotten that far yet
[18:42:55] <robertmaxrees> that's going to effect any element on the page, even ones outside of the table.
[18:43:06] <robertmaxrees> will the data come from an ajax call?
[18:43:07] <juinn> robertmaxrees: where would i put that?
[18:43:08] <robertmaxrees> ooor...?
[18:43:20] <juinn> data will come from table to be used in ajax call
[18:43:35] <robertmaxrees> so then grab the data and pass it directly to the ajax call.
[18:43:40] <juinn> ok
[18:43:41] <robertmaxrees> no need to store it somewhere in the interi,.
[18:44:27] <robertmaxrees> also: the in operator is janky.
[18:44:35] <robertmaxrees> just do if (field.attributes)
[18:44:36] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[18:45:07] <juinn> ok
[18:45:12] <juinn> changing all
[18:45:21] <juinn> dunno what to do with .click though =/
[18:45:21] <robertmaxrees> $tr.find('td').each(function() {
[18:45:33] <robertmaxrees> for click, do $table.find('.edit');
[18:45:35] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[18:45:57] <robertmaxrees> for those .each() calls, you're manually incrementing an index.
[18:45:58] <robertmaxrees> why?
[18:46:45] <robertmaxrees> looks like you want to enumerate over the columns and spit out some html?
[18:46:52] <juinn> for $(this).html(parse_field(columns[i]));
[18:47:06] <robertmaxrees> you realize .each() can give you an index, right?
[18:47:16] <robertmaxrees> also: why are you passing those titles in like that?
[18:47:18] <juinn> doh
[18:47:33] <juinn> titles as database column names
[18:47:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:47:47] <robertmaxrees> why are you putting database column info in a page??
[18:48:40] <robertmaxrees> oh, and that $(".save").click(function() { you set within that $(".edit").click(function() { is bad.
[18:49:00] <robertmaxrees> you'll end up adding that callback once for each time it's clicked.
[18:49:56] <robertmaxrees> O.o there's some really wacky stuff in here.  feel free to pm me for more.
[18:50:44] <juinn> i wanna cry..
[18:50:49] <robertmaxrees> nah, don';t.
[18:50:55] <robertmaxrees> just some stuff you aren't aware of :)
[18:50:57] <juinn> thank you...let me focus on what you've said so far
[18:51:01] <juinn> yep
[18:51:10] <juinn> i appreciate the good information
[20:29:05] <bjsnider> is it possible to do .click(function(){},function(){})  ?
