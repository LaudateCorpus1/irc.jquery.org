[00:25:14] <Ricaz> how can I animate the change in width that happens to an element if I change its html content?
[03:44:31] <sonu_nk> this one giving me " missing : after property id" var formStyling = []; formStyling.push({"formOuterStyle_"+form_id:preFormStyle[0].formOuterStyle}); what could be the issue ?
[03:45:09] <Cork> sonu_nk: form_id:preFormStyle[0]
[03:45:14] <Cork> what are you meaning to do there?
[03:46:07] <sonu_nk> form_id is dynamically generating here.. so i am pushing unique key with value
[03:46:40] <Cork> not sure what you mean
[03:46:54] <sonu_nk> formStyling.push({"formOuterStyle" : preFormStyle[0].formOuterStyle});	its working fine for me
[03:47:18] <Cork> ah
[03:47:20] <sonu_nk> but i want to store formOuterStyle_234 like for each form_id
[03:47:38] <Cork> ah
[03:47:46] <Cork> now i see what you're trying to do
[03:48:11] <Cork> pre es6 you can't create composit keys like that
[03:48:27] <Cork> you need to create the object and set the value+key on it and then use the variable
[03:48:46] <sonu_nk> i have this 						var formStyling = []; beforeall
[03:49:03] <Cork> var newObject = {}; newObject["formOuterStyle_"+form_id] = preFormStyle[0].formOuterStyle; formStyling.push(newObject)
[03:51:18] <Cork> in es6 you can do { [{"formOuterStyle" + form_id ]: preFormStyle[0].formOuterStyle }
[03:51:29] <Cork> but ya, can't depend on that just yet
[03:51:38] <Cork> opps
[03:51:53] <Cork> meant { [ "formOuterStyle" + form_id ]: preFormStyle[0].formOuterStyle }
[03:54:21] <sonu_nk> Cork, i am confussed..wht is the strong solution ?
[03:54:22] <sonu_nk> :D
[03:54:41] <sonu_nk> What should i do and wht should i not to do?
[03:54:43] <Cork> you have to first create a new object, store it in a variable
[03:55:00] <Cork> and then set the property with the var[key] = value syntax
[03:55:13] <Cork> the computed property syntax isn
[03:55:24] <Cork> *'t cross browser yet
[03:55:54] <sonu_nk> var newObject = {}; newObject["formOuterStyle_"+form_id] = preFormStyle[0].formOuterStyle; formStyling.push(newObject) is strong solution for cross brwoser. .. perfect?
[03:56:15] <Cork> not sure what you mean by strong, but yes it is what you should use
[03:57:01] <sonu_nk> strong means not break in any browser
[03:57:18] <Cork> that would normally be called compatible
[03:58:20] <sonu_nk> Cork, thank you .. but my english is poor..and lot of technical words i dont know
[04:00:17] <Cork> sonu_nk: this might be of interest https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#test-object_literal_extensions_computed_properties
[04:01:59] <sonu_nk> thank you Cork
[04:23:55] <sonu_nk> Cork, is this a right way to select nested attribute of div  : div[data-form = '_form-render-wrap'][data-form-id = 'NDQ5'] .actually i have data-form = '_form-render-wrap'] for 3 div and i have another attribute data-form-id which have unique value...
[04:25:48] <Cork> sonu_nk: you mean you want to select the element based on the attribute?
[04:25:57] <sonu_nk> yes
[04:26:02] <Cork> cause you don't select attributes
[04:26:06] <Cork> then yes
[04:27:03] <sonu_nk> div[data-form = '_form-render-wrap']this is working for me ...but div[data-form = '_form-render-wrap'][data-form-id = 'NDQ5'] not working
[04:27:27] <Cork> depends on what you want to select
[04:27:34] <Cork> for the second one to work both has to match
[04:28:54] <sonu_nk> div data-form="_form-render-wrap" data-form-id="NDI2"></div>     <div data-form="_form-render-wrap" data-form-id="NDQ5"]></div>    <div data-form="_form-render-wrap" data-form-id="ND16"></div>
[04:29:14] <sonu_nk> these are 3 div of mine.
[04:29:27] <Cork> sonu_nk: https://jsfiddle.net/fa4o4axv/
[04:32:05] <sonu_nk> i am doing same i think
[04:32:14] <sonu_nk> div[data-form = '_form-render-wrap'][data-form-id = 'NDQ5']
[04:32:30] <Cork> don't add space around =
[04:32:49] <Cork> it might work, but as space has a meaning in selectors i would recommend against it
[04:32:59] <sonu_nk> oh.. thankyo
[04:49:22] <prillian5> I try to create a mouseover with jquery: https://jsfiddle.net/k1f2myhh/15/
[04:50:01] <prillian5>  How can I run the mouseover only once, and not again, if the element is wrapped by the new div?
[04:56:07] <Cork> prillian5: firstly don't use attr('class') it means the element can't ever be touched by anything else
[04:56:12] <Cork> use hasClass https://jsfiddle.net/k1f2myhh/16/
[04:56:44] <Cork> prillian5: secondly what is it exactly you want to happen here?
[04:57:05] <Cork> only fire the event once or don't do anything if they have the overlay?
[04:57:25] <prillian5> Here I adjust the css a bit... and your hint with hasClass... https://jsfiddle.net/k1f2myhh/18/
[04:57:53] <prillian5> It should be an 50% transparent overlay for a given image
[04:58:03] <prillian5> mouseover, it appears, mouseout it disappears
[04:58:10] <Cork> hasClass checks for the class name it isn't to access the class attribute
[05:01:19] <Cork> prillian5: is this what you're looking for? https://jsfiddle.net/k1f2myhh/19/
[05:01:26] <Cork> opps missed one
[05:02:31] <Cork> prillian5: https://jsfiddle.net/k1f2myhh/20/
[05:04:18] <prillian5> Cork: thank you. looks nice (but only images dosn't switch... but seems to be css-stuff)
[05:04:39] <Cork> you can't override <img> images with css
[05:06:12] <prillian5> Cork: I create a div-wrapper which sholud be placed above the current one
[05:06:24] <Cork> no it is wrapping it
[05:06:33] <Cork> it will always be behind
[05:06:53] <Cork> you could do a hack with a :before psudo element
[05:07:03] <Cork> but other then that it will always be behind
[05:07:14] <prillian5> ok
[05:09:28] <prillian5> Cork: so it's maybe only a bit of smart logic. If I put the image from img as bg-img at the new wrapping div and put the layover as img-src (and give it opacity), it may aspect my needs
[05:10:01] <Cork> prillian5: ok, lets back up here; what exactly is it you want to do?
[05:10:26] <Cork> seams like you're making this a lot harder then it needs to be
[05:12:24] <prillian5> All I wan't i a little script, which makes me able to only wrap an image in <div class="xst_overlay">, which does all the other CSS-Stuff for me to create an overlay like this: http://storage9.static.itmages.com/i/17/0316/h_1489655528_3065623_6a82f4ec92.jpeg
[05:15:48] <prillian5> Cork:  Currently I do this with css. but it's a bit Fricky, because one is the :after with font-awesome-round-button, and one :before with the overlayer... and this have to be clickable (same url like the parent link). To get this easy in the future, I wan't to create the whole functionality once and add it onld by wrapping my image which should have an overlay with xst_overlay.
[05:16:38] <Cork> prillian5: you mean something like this? https://jsfiddle.net/k1f2myhh/21/
[05:17:58] <Cork> you could have the image in the overlay dynamic based on the original image if you like
[05:18:14] <Cork> (if i remember correctly...)
[05:18:28] <prillian5> Cork: nearly, but a bit more complicated
[05:19:42] <prillian5> The hard thing is, that the button is fully created in css with font-awesome-icon (as font).
[05:20:01] <prillian5> For this, I need the :after element. So I put the overlay in the before-element
[05:20:16] <Cork> ya?
[05:21:15] * Cork is still waiting for where it gets complicated
[05:21:23] <prillian5> And if I have an full image in before and after which cover my img (and href), I have to toggle this clickable
[05:21:52] <Cork> why?
[05:21:54] <prillian5> Maybe have a look at the both images in the middle of this page: http://www.zahnarzt-rain.com/entwicklung/cms/front_content.php?idcat=5
[05:22:03] <prillian5> there, you see what I mean
[05:22:35] <Cork> ya, sure, but why toggle clickable?
[05:23:04] <Cork> you can't click it if you don't hover it so i don't see why that state matter
[05:23:12] <prillian5> If I put the overlay over the image, Click doesn't work anymore
[05:23:21] <Cork> sure it does
[05:23:27] <Cork> the click is handled by the a element
[05:23:55] <Cork> (and hence the cover should go inside the a element)
[05:24:31] <prillian5> Cork: ok, I got the Idea. I give it a try. thanks
[05:54:49] <prillian5> Cork: ok, got it nice, easy and clean... like you suggest it. https://jsfiddle.net/k1f2myhh/24/
[05:59:16] <Cork> prillian5: just a little recommendation: https://jsfiddle.net/k1f2myhh/25/
[05:59:26] <Cork> makes the position of the icon always centered
[05:59:49] <prillian5> Cork: wow, great. thanks a lot.
[06:00:19] <Cork> transform: translate is a nice position trick :)
[06:01:09] <prillian5> yes, didn't use it much, but definetly will have a look at it.
[07:38:42] <JuJUBee> I am having some issues with a script that works in FF and Chromium but not in Chrome.
[07:39:05] <JuJUBee> FF reports a warning Use of getPreventDefault() is deprecated.  Use defaultPrevented instead.
[07:39:37] <JuJUBee> I am not using getPreventDefault() in my code.  Is this a call from the jq library itself?
[07:40:43] <prillian5> JuJUBee: do you have a link to that page
[07:40:56] <prillian5> BTW: Be aware, that not a browser-plugin is the cause of this issue
[07:41:08] <JuJUBee> It is being used in a secure site on Intranet
[07:41:22] <JuJUBee> ?
[07:42:30] <JuJUBee> prillian5, do you mean a plugin is the cause?
[07:43:24] <JuJUBee> I think you may be correct.  WOrks in incognito...
[07:44:18] <prillian5> JuJUBee: thats an issue, which also happend at some pages for me.
[07:44:37] <JuJUBee> any ideas which plugin(s) may be causing?
[07:44:44] <prillian5> It makes you sesitive again, what an browser-extension may do ^^
[07:45:24] <prillian5> Thats the reason, I have installed this chrome-plugin: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/incognito-filter/cifilbmpnkjinlkchohdfcpdkmpngiik
[07:45:54] <prillian5> You can find out, open the Browser-Console, and check the source-tab
[07:47:02] <JuJUBee> prillian5, do you mean F12 then look at console?
[07:47:25] <prillian5> yep
[07:47:33] <prillian5> and here is the way you go: http://storage5.static.itmages.com/i/17/0316/h_1489664829_4061877_9fed7d7919.jpeg
[07:48:12] <prillian5> sources -> conten scripts ... there you should found your extension which fires the command you search for
[07:48:22] <JuJUBee> Nothing there
[07:50:55] <JuJUBee> I have disabled my plugins and still does not work
[08:00:55] <Cork> JuJUBee: that warning isn't an error
[08:00:58] <prillian5> Then you could install this plugin:
[08:01:08] <prillian5> https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simpleextmanager/kniehgiejgnnpgojkdhhjbgbllnfkfdk
[08:01:23] <Cork> JuJUBee: the "Use defaultPrevented instead" comes from jquery touching legacy properties to support old browsers
[08:01:43] <Cork> but it detects if the browser supports newer things, so you can ignore that warning
[08:01:44] <prillian5> JuJUBee: With it, you can easily activate and deactivate each extension. So you can find out by toggeling - which one is cause of the trouble
[08:02:08] <JuJUBee> Cork, OK, but why is script not working in Chrome but works in Chromium and FF
[08:02:09] <prillian5> I go for launch. Have  a nice day.
[08:02:20] <Cork> JuJUBee: that i can't say without seeing the problem
[08:02:31] <Cork> might be difference in version where something is disabled for example
[08:03:13] <JuJUBee> By something,  you mean extension/plugin?
[08:05:42] <Cork> JuJUBee: different versions has different features activated
[08:05:53] <Cork> JuJUBee: it might be something like that breaking something
[08:06:00] <Cork> depends on what is breaking and how
[08:07:05] <JuJUBee> Cork, I have all extensions/plugins disabled except the gnome shell integration.  I cannot seem to disable or remove it from chrome.
[08:07:42] <Cork> JuJUBee: start by figuring out what exact code in your page isn't executing
[08:08:01] <Cork> JuJUBee: don't start by "nothing works" cause that isn't ever true
[08:08:11] <Cork> find what breaks and start from there
[08:09:02] <Cork> your almost always doing your self a disservice if you directly point the blame at the browser
[08:09:29] <Cork> instead prove that it breaks and then you have a much better understanding what it can be
[08:10:59] <JuJUBee> Cork, thanks.  I have a .change() js function that doesn't seem to work in chrome but F12 is not showing me anything
[08:10:59] <sonu_nk> Cork,  is there any way with which we can check the particular script is loaded before not..if its loaded before then do not load again..
[08:12:35] <Cork> JuJUBee: ok, by .change you mean an event listener or a tribber (.trigger('change'))?
[08:13:06] <Cork> sonu_nk: no, javascript doesn't have a notion of scripts, it is just one big memory area
[08:13:19] <Cork> (it is html that has a notion of scripts)
[08:13:50] <Cork> uh...
[08:13:54] <Cork> tribber==trigger
[08:33:04] <na_th_an> what's the shortest way to do "var x = $('#something'); if (x.size() > 0) { someFunction(x); }" ?
[08:33:57] <Cork> $('#something').each(function() { someFunction($(this); });
[08:34:05] <na_th_an> that's what I thought
[08:34:25] <na_th_an> there will only ever be one of them and I guess I'd like something that would express that
[08:34:29] <Cork> btw don't use .size() it has been depricated since long
[08:34:37] <Cork> and is just a function to access .length
[08:34:42] <na_th_an> well our monolith is on an ancient version so :/
[08:34:53] <Cork> na_th_an: it
[08:35:02] <Cork> na_th_an: it's an id so it can ever only be one
[08:35:08] <Cork> by definition
[08:35:20] <Cork> na_th_an: .length has worked since long before 1.0
[08:35:27] <na_th_an> is that enforced in jquery or convention enforced by developers doing the right thing?
[08:35:35] <na_th_an> because if it's the second one, then that assumption doesn't hold for me
[08:35:46] <Cork> na_th_an: it is enforced by the dom specification
[08:35:54] <Cork> an id can ever only match one element
[08:36:02] <na_th_an> okay cool
[08:36:04] <na_th_an> thanks
[08:36:13] <Cork> if you have multiple elements with the same id
[08:36:22] <Cork> the dom behaves like only the first one has one
[08:36:29] <na_th_an> TIL
[08:41:49] <JuJUBee> Cork, sorry, had to step out for a bit... Using a listener?  $("#copyToSchoolYear").change(function(e){...})
[08:42:32] <Cork> JuJUBee: and if you run console.log($("#copyToSchoolYear").length) directly before that line do you get a 1 in the console?
[08:43:20] <Cork> actually might be worth running console.log($("[id="copyToSchoolYear"]').length)
[08:43:25] <Cork> so make sure you only have one
[08:45:15] <JuJUBee> Cork, Only have one instance and not returning anything in console
[08:45:38] <Cork> console.log("i'm executed") ?
[08:46:41] <Cork> if that doesn't log anything try clearing the browser cache
[08:49:45] <JuJUBee> That did the trick.  .length returned 0
[08:50:13] <Cork> ok, so the element you want to bind the listener on doesn't exist
[08:50:46] <Cork> either you are running the code before the dom is completely constructed (without .ready) or something else is preventing that element from getting added
[08:52:20] <JuJUBee> I am using .ready.  Now it returned a 1 for some reason
[08:53:24] <JuJUBee> But not returning anything in chrome
[08:54:08] <JuJUBee> only FF & chromium
[08:54:30] <Cork> in chrome can you find the element there by hand?
[08:54:55] <Cork> (also might be the server has ua sniffing and sends different things)
[08:55:11] <JuJUBee> using inspect element?  yes
[08:55:38] <Cork> and if you in the console run $("#copyToSchoolYear").length you still get 0?
[08:55:50] <JuJUBee> no i'm getting 1 now
[08:56:51] <JuJUBee> just not in chrome, getting nothing not even a zero
[08:57:11] <Cork> sure, but check in chromes developer tools
[08:57:30] <JuJUBee> F12 console is blank not a 0 or a 1
[08:57:47] <Cork> and if you run that line in the console of chrome?
[08:58:48] <JuJUBee> If I run manually I get a 1  then on next line I get undefined
[08:59:04] <Cork> then you run the console.log() line right=
[08:59:06] <Cork> *?
[08:59:24] <Cork> cause  $("#copyToSchoolYear").length should not give you undefined
[09:01:27] <JuJUBee> undefined is on the line under the 1 which is under the console.log()
[09:01:52] <Cork> ok, is the element added statically or dynamically (ex. through ajax)?
[09:02:00] <JuJUBee> static
[09:02:23] <JuJUBee> if I run console.log("Test"); manually I get undefined after it prints Test
[09:02:43] <Cork> ya, i know cause the console.log function doesn't return anything
[09:02:53] <Cork> but i didn't ask you to run console.log
[09:02:56] <Cork> anyway
[09:03:16] <Cork> can't really get you much further without seeing the problem
[09:03:42] <JuJUBee> my bad, the  $("#copyToSchoolYear").length returns 1 and no undefined
[09:03:43] <Cork> if you can reproduce it in a jsfiddle i could have a go at it (though i have to run in about 40 mins)
[09:04:12] <JuJUBee> The problem is there is ajax calls to a mysql db
[09:04:29] <Cork> uh, didn't you say the element was static?
[09:04:37] <JuJUBee> Basically when I change the school year, I want to retrieve the list of classes to select from
[09:04:44] <MassDebates> That's dynamic
[09:05:34] <JuJUBee> Cork, yes, I manually added the element and the js
[09:06:04] <JuJUBee> on change it creates a new selection list elsewhere
[09:06:06] <Cork> JuJUBee: uh... ok, the problem is your running the event catches before the element is in the dom
[09:06:21] <Cork> and that is why things isn't working
[09:06:59] <JuJUBee> Isn't $(document).ready(function() {...} supposed to prevent that?
[09:07:02] <Cork> when the element ends up in the dom most likely differs a tiny bit cause of browser implementation/cache timing or similar
[09:07:05] <Cork> no
[09:07:15] <Cork> .ready will hold the page on static content load
[09:07:21] <Cork> it won't wait for content added through js
[09:08:43] <JuJUBee> But the element I have the .change attached to cannot fire until the dom loads
[09:09:00] <Cork> sure, but the event handler is bound when the code runs
[09:09:19] <Cork> and if the $() selector doesn't find any elements .change(function() {}) doesn't bind to anything
[09:09:37] <JuJUBee> I thought the handlers dont attach until the dom finishes loading?
[09:09:48] <Cork> only if you delay the code execution
[09:10:10] <JuJUBee> How do I figure out if this is the case?
[09:10:18] <Cork> and again that only helps if the element is added before the initial dom construction finishes
[09:10:39] <Cork> if the element is added through js (ajax, template, anything like that) you have the case
[09:10:57] <Cork> and as you said it is added through ajax from the db you have that case
[09:11:31] <JuJUBee> So what can I do?  just wait a few minutes and test ?
[09:12:16] <Cork> simplest is to select a _STATIC_ parent and delegate the event handler to id $('#static-parent-that-is-always-here').on('change', '#copyToSchoolYear', function() {})
[09:12:30] <Cork> *handler to it
[09:13:16] <JuJUBee> The selection list *is* always there.  It is coded in the html/php the list generated by the change is not always there.
[09:13:46] <Cork> try the delegation
[09:14:36] <Cork> ex. $(document).on('change', '#copyToSchoolYear', function() {})
[09:15:01] <Cork> if that one doesn't work either you will have to make a testcase cause then i can't guide you to a solution
[09:15:14] <JuJUBee> OK, Ill have a go at it
[09:23:04] <sherm4n4tor> Has there been a solution to solve "load more" button using AJAX and if a user navigate to another page and decides to click the back button, the page will load up all the elements that was loaded before?  A great example will be on http://www.ign.com.  Scroll to the bottom of the site and click on the "Load More News & Updates" at least two times.  Click on one of the links that was loaded...
[09:23:05] <sherm4n4tor> ...and click on the browser's back button.  You start at the beginning of the site.  This is quite annoying as I'll have to find where I left off at.
[09:23:34] <Cork> sherm4n4tor: there are several
[09:23:50] <sherm4n4tor> I'm looking at this one: http://pjax.herokuapp.com/
[09:23:57] <sherm4n4tor> but I don't know if this will work.
[09:23:59] <Cork> you could either set scrollTop on page load there through preventing it from loading the extra elements as it won't scroll there
[09:24:37] <Cork> or you could add the scroll offset as a parameter in the url and have the server populate the elements needed to start with so it won't need to send it separately
[09:24:54] <Cork> there are other solutions too, but those are the core different solutions
[09:25:18] <sherm4n4tor> So there's no way for the page to cache whatever that was loaded previously?
[09:25:26] <Cork> not really
[09:25:51] <Cork> you could push the data into something like indexeddb
[09:25:57] <Cork> but it is very inefficient
[09:26:25] <Cork> the best solution caching would be to separate urls for each "read more" and have the browser cache each request
[09:26:26] <sherm4n4tor> Imagine if a user clicked the "Show More" button 10x and finds an article.  If the user goes back, the system will have to run a query to load those 10 pages again.
[09:26:35] <Cork> then the ajax call would still happen but it would load from the cache
[09:27:14] <Cork> but it requires some thinking so you mark the request as cachable correctly
[09:27:30] <Cork> and also that you are sure it won't need to change in that time period
[09:27:37] <sherm4n4tor> maybe the best solution for me is to use pagination.
[09:27:50] <sherm4n4tor> so it will only load the current page if a user clicks back
[09:27:58] <Cork> it is basically the same solution just different ui
[09:28:42] <sherm4n4tor> but instead of loading x many objects again, it'll just load that portion of the page they were on.
[09:28:53] <Cork> you don't have to load x objects
[09:29:05] <Cork> you DO have to decide how to treat it through
[09:29:30] <sherm4n4tor> do you have any demos out there?
[09:29:44] <Cork> no, not on hand
[09:30:03] <Cork> but you can have a look at history.pushState demos
[09:30:20] <Cork> if i remember correctly some of them store info about where it is in the url
[09:30:28] <sherm4n4tor> that's what this one is doing: https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax
[09:30:34] <Cork> (and that means the server can know what needs to happen)
[09:32:10] <sherm4n4tor> Cork++
[09:32:22] <JuJUBee> Cork, When I use $(document).on('change', '#copyToSchoolYear',function(e){...}}; I get an error TypeError: $(...).on is not a function[Learn More]
[09:32:24] <sherm4n4tor> is that how you add karma to you?  I'm new to this.
[09:32:39] <Cork> JuJUBee: what version of jquery are you using?
[09:33:02] <Cork> sherm4n4tor: there isn't a karma tracker here
[09:33:08] <sherm4n4tor> ok
[09:33:32] <sherm4n4tor> JuJUBee: make sure jQuery is loaded first before you execute that code.
[09:33:51] <sherm4n4tor> JuJUBee: You can wrap that into $(function(){  ...    })
[09:33:57] <Cork> sherm4n4tor: its an old version of jquery i forgot that
[09:34:13] <Cork> i just need to know the version number
[09:38:11] <JuJUBee> 1.6.3  I know its very old, but when I tried to upgrade it created more errors and I don't have tons of time to diagnose yet.
[09:38:34] <Cork> ok, then try $(document).delegate('#copyToSchoolYear', 'change', function() {})
[09:38:58] <Cork> that one works since 1.5
[09:40:22] <JuJUBee> I get nothing in the console when using chrome not even the "Use of getPreventDefault() is depreciated..." like I get in ff and chromium
[09:41:13] <Cork> ya, sorry i need to see this in action to help more (and i have to run now too)
[09:43:28] <JuJUBee> Thanks for the help
[09:48:18] <sherm4n4tor> Cork: I think I found a working sample from https://www.skechers.com/en-us/men/all
[09:48:46] <sherm4n4tor> looks like the browser keeps track of the pageIndex and ID of the element the user clicked.
[09:49:15] <sherm4n4tor> this will probably work for me.
[11:03:10] <JuJUBee> Cork, you still around?  Think I have a jsfiddle up to work from
[11:05:42] <taplar> what's up?
[11:06:04] <JuJUBee> https://jsfiddle.net/qbLqL74m/  works in jsfiddle, not in browser
[11:06:34] <JuJUBee> taplar, was trying to diagnose an issue with script working in FF and Chromium but not in Chrome earlier with Cork
[11:06:46] <taplar> you are using version 1.9.1 on your site?
[11:06:59] <JuJUBee> taplar, minimized the code to jsfiddle to test
[11:07:10] <JuJUBee> yes
[11:07:16] <JuJUBee> for now
[11:07:20] <taplar> how are you running the script on your site?
[11:07:29] <JuJUBee> what do you mean?
[11:07:44] <taplar> in your head, body, is it in a doc ready, etc ?
[11:08:00] <JuJUBee> within $(document).ready(function(){...});
[11:08:25] <JuJUBee> called the js file from head
[11:08:32] <taplar> is copyToSchoolYear a static or dynamically created element?
[11:08:41] <JuJUBee> static
[11:08:59] <taplar> any console errors?
[11:09:00] <JuJUBee> as in I created it and it gets its list from a db query
[11:09:03] <JuJUBee> nothin
[11:09:15] <taplar> wait, what do you mean  you created it?
[11:09:25] <JuJUBee> I coded it...
[11:09:39] <JuJUBee> not put into source via ajax
[11:09:40] <taplar> is it in the markup, or is it generated by javascript after page load?
[11:09:45] <JuJUBee> markup
[11:09:48] <taplar> k
[11:09:55] <JuJUBee> sorry, im not a programmer, I teach networking
[11:10:13] <taplar> in that case i'd have to see it failing cause what you have in the fiddle and what you said sound fine.
[11:10:27] <taplar> have you tried logging the selector before you bind on the element?
[11:10:42] <JuJUBee> What I have in the fiddle is not working in browser locally
[11:11:16] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/qbLqL74m/1/  try that and see what if anything logs
[11:12:39] <JuJUBee> nothing in the log
[11:13:03] <taplar> not even a number?
[11:13:16] <JuJUBee> nope
[11:13:27] <taplar> then either you have logging turned off, or your script is not running
[11:13:30] <JuJUBee> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.1.js"></script> in my <head>...
[11:14:15] <taplar> how do you have your other script in your head?
[11:14:26] <JuJUBee> OK, im an idiot
[11:14:34] <JuJUBee> forgot to load my js file :(
[11:14:38] <taplar> :D
[11:19:10] <JuJUBee> So when I apply the 1.9.1 to my live site, it throws error cause I am using jquery.validationEngine  ... jquery.validationEngine.js:28 Uncaught TypeError: $(...).live is not a function
[11:19:32] <taplar> iirc live() was deprecated in some version
[11:19:59] <taplar> yeah, deprecated in 1.7, removed in 1.9
[11:20:29] <taplar> so you'll need to either update the validationEngine to a newer version possibly, or use a jquery version prior to 1.9
[11:21:02] <JuJUBee> I was using 1.6.3 and that is when I noticed this problem, so I loaded 1.9.1
[11:21:16] <taplar> wow, that plugin is super old
[11:21:38] <taplar> wait, no, last updated dec last year, so ok
[11:22:29] <taplar> so yeah, you should consider updating that plugin
[11:22:40] <taplar> https://github.com/posabsolute/jQuery-Validation-Engine
[11:29:41] <JuJUBee> Just did now have more problems to figure out
[11:33:08] <JuJUBee> taplar, strange thing is that when I first started with my new script it wasn't working in Chrome only in FF and Chromium.  I was using validataion engine v2.0 and jq v 1.6.3
[11:35:20] <JuJUBee> If I switch everything back to original (validation 2.0 & JQ v1.6.3) works fine in FF and CHromium
[11:35:35] <JuJUBee> Fails with nothing in console in Chrome.
[12:32:26] <skypce> hi all
[12:32:31] <robertmaxrees> good morning
[12:32:32] <skypce> can you help me with this please
[12:32:32] <skypce> http://pastebin.com/y4XkaeBD
[12:32:38] <skypce> the code works
[12:33:00] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[12:33:05] <skypce> i need move some div when change resolution, all works but when i move it duplicate contents
[12:33:09] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('scroll', function () {
[12:33:28] <robertmaxrees> you know that you aren't replacing the event bidning every time you do that, right?
[12:33:41] <robertmaxrees> you're adding one for each resize event.
[12:35:03] <robertmaxrees> also doing a lot of slow calculations on scroll.
[12:37:17] <skypce> some help?
[12:37:19] <skypce> robertmaxrees,
[12:37:35] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:37:46] <skypce> i will declare the vars out of if
[12:37:53] <robertmaxrees> that's an issue too.
[12:38:20] <robertmaxrees> should also do a var $window = $(window); before that function so you're not creating a new element every time.
[12:38:25] <robertmaxrees> and move those scroll handler.
[12:38:27] <robertmaxrees> *handlers
[12:38:46] <robertmaxrees> try making a simplified fiddle so i can see the problem in action.
[12:38:56] <skypce> ok
[13:13:34] <JuJUBee> Can someone have a look at this code and see if I am missing something?  http://pastebin.com/q2L5gFd0
[13:14:39] <JuJUBee> It is working in FF and Chromium but not in Chrome.  Been troubleshooting all day.
[13:15:29] <taplar> can you make a fiddle showing the issue?
[13:16:55] <JuJUBee> taplar, I tried with a simplified one earlier but it seems to work in all 3 https://jsfiddle.net/qbLqL74m/
[13:17:27] <taplar> that fiddle doesn't do anything with that validation plugin
[13:18:31] <JuJUBee> I tried disabeling the plugin in the code and same thing
[13:23:39] <JuJUBee> taplar, updated code http://pastebin.com/mYJSQbwQ
[13:25:21] <taplar> if it works in FF and chromium, but not chrome, we really need to see a working example of it failing
[13:25:28] <taplar> cause chromium is pretty much chrome
[13:25:53] <JuJUBee> So.... I just tried Chrome on Windows (I use Ubuntu) and it works.
[13:26:05] <JuJUBee> Something wack with chrome for linux
[13:48:16] <phlix> if ((urlPath !== 'cruises') || (urlPath !== 'flights')) { even when urlPath does equal cruises or flights its still executing code in this statement.
[13:48:20] <phlix> what in the world am I missing
[13:48:40] <taplar> both cases are true for the other case
[13:48:54] <JuJUBee> taplar, seems that my problem is specific to google chrome on ubuntu
[13:49:01] <JuJUBee> Works in all other browsers I have
[13:49:19] <phlix> taplar: not sure i understand.
[13:49:32] <taplar> cruises !== flights
[13:50:09] <phlix> Yes so if urlPath is equal to anything other than cruises or flights I want to execute a piece of code
[13:50:19] <taplar> that's not how OR works
[13:50:44] <taplar> if either of the statements evaluates to true, it executes the logic
[13:50:58] <phlix> would I need to use and ?
[13:51:01] <phlix> that doesn't sound right
[13:51:14] <taplar> you want it to not execute if it is either of those, right?
[13:51:19] <phlix> yes
[13:51:27] <taplar> so not 'cruises' and not 'flights'
[13:51:38] <phlix> exactly
[13:51:41] <taplar> so....
[13:51:55] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:52:05] <phlix> interesting. i feel super retarded right now
[13:52:19] <robertmaxrees> heh. not an okay word here.  thanks :)
[13:52:26] <phlix> sorry.
[13:52:30] <robertmaxrees> all good.
[13:53:09] <taplar> you can also be a little trick with it if you want
[13:53:33] <taplar> [ 'cruises', 'flights' ].indexOf( urlPath ) < 0
[13:53:53] <phlix> ahh, i like that approach better
[13:54:20] <taplar> though admittedly it is less readable
[13:54:25] <robertmaxrees> just define that array and give it a clear name.
[13:54:31] <robertmaxrees> then you solve the readability problem.
[14:20:16] <devslash> is there a way to get the name of the class that triggered an event inside of the event itself using $(this) ?
[14:20:41] <robertmaxrees> you can get the classes on the element.
[14:20:57] <devslash> huh
[14:21:14] <taplar> what problem are you trying to solve?
[14:22:28] <devslash> i have an event that is triggered by multiple classes and I want to set a var based on the class that triggered the event
[14:22:45] <taplar> classes don't trigger events
[14:22:48] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:22:59] <robertmaxrees> elements do.  you mean you have a binding that uses multiple classes?
[14:23:01] <devslash> they do if you have a ready event
[14:23:05] <devslash> yes
[14:23:15] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating how it works, which is why my response was confusing.
[14:23:27] <robertmaxrees> the element emits the event.  you have a binding listening for it.
[14:23:38] <taplar> it's an important distinction, and is why some people are confused why they change classes on things and event handlers still fire
[14:23:38] <robertmaxrees> you can test if the element that emitted the event has a particular class.
[14:23:52] <devslash> i tried that but it always returns false
[14:24:03] <robertmaxrees> mind showing us what you tried?
[14:24:16] <devslash> $(this).hasClass('MYFUCKINGCLASSNAME');
[14:24:25] <devslash> returns false
[14:24:40] <taplar> so it doesn't have the class
[14:24:52] <devslash> then how do i know what triggered the event
[14:25:00] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:25:07] <devslash> which element
[14:25:13] <taplar> 'this' is the element
[14:25:29] <robertmaxrees> like: https://jsfiddle.net/h94ogvj8/
[14:25:30] <robertmaxrees> it works.
[14:27:29] <devslash> i also tried $(this).attr("class"); which is undefined
[14:27:38] <robertmaxrees> then something is way off.
[14:27:41] <robertmaxrees> can you show us a test case?
[14:27:54] <devslash> no its an internal application so I cant
[14:28:02] <robertmaxrees> even if you change the names of things?
[14:28:11] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/h94ogvj8/2/
[14:29:02] <taplar> it is entirely possible that the selector used to apply the handler to the element is no longer valid.  meaning if you used a class to find the element, put the binding on it, and then later that class was taken off, it would fall in the case that hasClass would be false
[14:34:20] <devslash> what about if the event has an event parameter
[14:34:41] <robertmaxrees> the handler you mean?
[14:34:46] <robertmaxrees> and what about it?
[14:34:48] <devslash> so its defined as .ready(function(event) { could I use that var
[14:34:55] <devslash> to get the class name
[14:35:10] <robertmaxrees> woah woah woah
[14:35:11] <robertmaxrees> back up.
[14:35:17] <robertmaxrees> what are you targeting with ready?
[14:35:43] <devslash> I have a tab control with a jquery ready event
[14:36:03] <robertmaxrees> you know that only fires once, right?
[14:36:08] <devslash> its defined like this: $('.TAB1,.TAB2').ready(function(event) {
[14:36:10] <devslash> yes
[14:36:20] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[14:36:27] <robertmaxrees> it's giving you the document always.
[14:36:41] <robertmaxrees> $( "img" ).ready( handler ) is the same as $(document).ready();
[14:36:47] <robertmaxrees> that's why you're having issues.
[14:37:13] <devslash> then what event do i use to make sure that it fires once for each element
[14:37:18] <devslash> that the event is bound to
[14:37:36] <taplar> what event?
[14:37:37] <robertmaxrees> what's the logic you're running?>
[14:37:49] <devslash> what do you mean
[14:37:54] <robertmaxrees> inside the ready.
[14:38:17] <devslash> i am executing code that uses a jquery plugin to make a table inside of the tab have a fixed table header
[14:38:19] <devslash> but
[14:38:27] <robertmaxrees> then just run it within a document ready.
[14:38:34] <robertmaxrees> you can use .each() if you need to do special handling for each one.
[14:38:39] <devslash> the element isnt visible to the page until you click on the tab
[14:38:51] <devslash> otherwise $('TABLENAME').length returns 0
[14:38:54] <robertmaxrees> do you want to initialize when you've clicked the tab?
[14:38:54] <taplar> so click is the event
[14:38:59] <robertmaxrees> ^^^^^
[14:39:11] <devslash> but can I unload the click event from within the event
[14:39:15] <taplar> one()
[14:39:17] <devslash> so it only executes once
[14:39:21] <devslash> huh
[14:39:28] <devslash> whats the syntax for that
[14:39:29] <taplar> one() is like on() but it only happens once
[14:39:36] <taplar> same syntax
[14:39:43] <robertmaxrees> or you add a class on click and check for its existince within the handler.
[14:39:47] <devslash> im confused
[14:40:04] <robertmaxrees> wait are you loading this stuff in via ajax?
[14:40:13] <devslash> no
[14:40:46] <robertmaxrees> the problem is .ready() applies to the entire page, not to any individual element.  so when you do $('.TAB1,.TAB2').ready(, $(this) is still document.
[14:41:00] <robertmaxrees> and it's firing when the document is ready, not any particular element.
[14:42:23] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/565c2L68/
[16:13:32] <firas> guys I made a newbie website using html,css,bootstrap, jekyll , gh-pages. The website is www.dotslashlinux.com . Please visit it and point out the mistakes I made and put me on the right track ! Thanks a lot in advance ! Your help is much appreciated !
[16:18:54] <devslash> i wrote this code: https://jsfiddle.net/uyy3w3x9/ when my page load and I click on one of these 2 tabs that have a click event, I see the alert for that event but after that the events dont fire any more
[16:20:38] <devslash> i dont understand why the first first click is registered then all other clicks on eith click event are ignored
[16:24:27] <physikoi_> Hello #jquery. Is there a best practice for adding both single click and double click event listeners to a single element? Also, I'd like to avoid using plugins.
[16:25:03] <devslash> you can have 1 event definition for more than one event
[16:27:33] <physikoi_> devslash: hi. from what i read on the jquery site, whether or not a given temporal difference between clicks registers as a dblclick event is system dependent. How does one contend with that?
[16:27:56] <devslash> no
[16:28:00] <devslash> i dont think so
[16:28:06] <devslash> jquery isnt platform specific
[16:28:52] <physikoi_> "The mouse button is depressed again while the pointer is inside the element, within a time window that is system-dependent." from https://api.jquery.com/dblclick/
[16:29:09] <physikoi_> Am i misinterpreting what's written?
[16:30:45] <devslash> im not sure but i cant look into that right now
[16:31:23] <physikoi_> devslash: np. thanks anyway
[16:31:48] <devslash> is anyone else here
[16:31:59] <devslash> im having a problem with my jquery event only firing once
[16:49:07] <MagnusVortex> physikoi_: why do you need to contend with that?
[16:50:18] <MagnusVortex> devslash: I'm the opposite of an expert, but it sounds to me like there's some state that's being left over
[16:50:26] <devslash> i figured it out
[16:50:28] <MagnusVortex> are you fully consuming the event?
[16:50:35] <physikoi_> MagnusVortex: well, here's what I'm trying to do for my plugin. Single click on an image loads the next. Doubleclick on the same image starts up fullscreen mode. That said, the better route seems to be to measure the time between single click events.
[16:50:36] <devslash> yes and im full
[16:50:45] <MagnusVortex> oh, what was the issue then, devslash?
[16:50:54] <devslash> the syntax
[16:51:11] <devslash> should be in the form: $('body').on('click','#MYID',function(){
[16:51:14] <MagnusVortex> ah. well, I guess I wouldn't have been a help after all ><
[16:55:06] <MagnusVortex> physikoi_: when doubleclick fires, does it also fire the singleclick event?
[16:55:26] <qakhan> hi all
[16:55:29] <physikoi_> i think it depends on the browser
[16:55:31] <qakhan> I am using jQuery validation plugin and have come up with a scenario I need to create a remote validation rule.
[16:55:40] <qakhan> I have a user edit form which administrator can edit their users profile containing their username and other info.
[16:55:46] <physikoi_> also, i dont think i could control the "sensitivity"
[16:55:56] <qakhan> which is populated from a database. I would have checked using a remote method to check the username doesn't already exist if administrator change.
[16:55:56] <qakhan> when administrator doesn't want to update username and try to save the form, the validation will still check the username saying the username already exists.
[16:56:04] <qakhan> Is there a way I can call the remote method only if the username has been changed in the form. If username doest change then don't need to validate.
[16:56:11] <MagnusVortex> If possible, you'd prefer to utilize the system's setting for doubleclick speed. A lot of people have trouble clicking fast enough to pull off a double-click and so have to make adjustments at the operating system level (windows lets you set this quite easily - or at least used to)
[16:56:15] <physikoi_> MagnusVortex: measuring time between single clicks seems like a viable way. so far so good
[16:56:26] <qakhan> here is my remote validation code http://pastebin.com/gNcWJCiu
[16:58:21] <MagnusVortex> qakhan: so you're saying you have some data in a field, and when someone clicks a submit button you want to know if the data in that field has changed?
[16:59:23] <qakhan> right, if there is no change in data then dont do remote validate. if data is changed then YES
[17:05:03] <MagnusVortex> qakhan: did taking a step back help you solve your problem, or would you rather I spell out what I'm thinking?
[17:06:26] <qakhan> MagnusVortex i did not get you
[17:07:00] <MagnusVortex> when you populate the field with the data from your database, store the value somewhere
[17:07:18] <MagnusVortex> when your user clicks the submit button, compare the value of the field with the value you stored
[17:08:11] <qakhan> can you please give me some example
[17:08:56] <MagnusVortex> I cannot.

[18:45:51] <d2k> I'm not sure why the Cache issue is solved. Example: I load a .html file inside a iframe, that iframe is inside a php (could be hmtl but seems to work better in php, true?). I can only give the php a Cache-Control: no-cache header, the html cannot be overwritten.
[18:47:57] <d2k> The html file used to cause a cache issue, but miracle miracle, the php that loads the html solves that even the generator of the html file now seems to generate cache-issue free code. How can that be?
[18:52:01] <d2k> I guess it's something with the browser cache, I mean: My Chrome went craizy? Mixing up different outputs that should not be threated with the same Cache?
[19:26:26] <johnnyee> hello
[19:26:52] <johnnyee> i created a chat, the mouseover doesnt work
[19:27:08] <johnnyee> after loading the content
[19:44:29] <Darmani> So my form keeps getting submitted but it refreshes the page and I don't know why.
[19:44:30] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/c31432aa05ae81f0b7eb11e15383aeed
[19:46:09] <robertmaxrees> html instead pls
[19:46:31] <robertmaxrees> also: where do you stop the form submit?
[19:47:02] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: oh hey man :D
[19:47:13] <Darmani> And right here I thought
[19:47:13] <Darmani> https://gist.github.com/mfifth/c31432aa05ae81f0b7eb11e15383aeed#file-ajax_call-js-L10
[19:47:25] <robertmaxrees> html
[19:47:35] <robertmaxrees> because as far as I can tell, that code runs on change.
[19:47:46] <robertmaxrees> but i don't know erb soooo
[19:47:54] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: No worries let me get the rendered html shit...
[19:49:54] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/c31432aa05ae81f0b7eb11e15383aeed#file-rendered-html
[19:50:25] <robertmaxrees> so https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5v6at7y6/ ?
[19:50:45] <Darmani> umm yeah
[19:50:46] <Darmani> I think so
[19:50:50] <robertmaxrees> that's not reloading the page.
[19:50:53] <robertmaxrees> so i'm not sure what's up.
[19:51:03] <robertmaxrees> also: don't use onchange.
[19:51:24] <Darmani> Is that what it is?
[19:51:33] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:51:37] <robertmaxrees> that's just an aside.
[19:51:39] <Darmani> the onChange
[19:51:41] <Darmani> oh
[19:51:48] <robertmaxrees> there's nothing there that would cause the form to submit.
[19:52:09] <robertmaxrees> just generally advisable to not use attributes like that.
[19:52:09] <Darmani> What do you mean
[19:52:16] <Darmani> the onChange doesn't submit the form?
[19:52:26] <robertmaxrees> the function you have runs some ajax.
[19:52:35] <robertmaxrees> but doesn't use the native form submit.
[19:52:55] <Darmani> that's what it's supposed to do..
[19:53:03] <robertmaxrees> run the ajax?
[19:53:07] <Darmani> ya
[19:53:11] <robertmaxrees> it's doing that.
[19:53:20] <Darmani> but it's also refreshing the entire page
[19:53:25] <robertmaxrees> nothing here would trigger a native form submit.
[19:53:30] <robertmaxrees> so you've got something else going on.
[19:53:47] <Darmani> Something else is causing a full page refresh?
[19:53:58] <robertmaxrees> try that fiddle.
[19:54:02] <robertmaxrees> notice how the page doesn;'t refresh?
[19:54:40] <robertmaxrees> what code there would cause it to?
[19:55:07] <Darmani> I have no idea.
[19:55:31] <robertmaxrees>  heh
[19:55:38] <Darmani> That fiddle isn't submitting anything btw
[19:55:44] <Darmani> So there isn't an ajax call going on.
[19:55:46] <robertmaxrees> *the ajax is failing.
[19:55:51] <Darmani> ya
[19:55:54] <robertmaxrees> either way, does the reload happen when you change that select?
[19:56:08] <Darmani> No but it wouldn't anyway right?
[19:56:17] <robertmaxrees> wait then when does the page reload happen?
[19:56:30] <Darmani> After the ajax success.
[19:56:37] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[19:56:50] <robertmaxrees> so you change the dropdown, the ajax call runs, and when it finishes, the page reloads?
[19:56:58] <Darmani> yuuup
[19:57:10] <robertmaxrees> noithing here would cause that.
[19:57:29] <Darmani> o.o
[19:57:41] <Darmani> what in the actual fuck
[19:57:56] <robertmaxrees> change events don't trigger reloads.  ajax doesn't on its own.
[19:58:05] <robertmaxrees> only submitting the form or actually reloading the page would.
[19:58:57] <Darmani> I...
[19:58:57] <robertmaxrees> do you maybe have any global ajax event handlers?
[19:58:59] <Darmani> am so lost.
[19:59:14] <Darmani> I just started this app so this is the very first function I've written in js lol
[19:59:37] <robertmaxrees> any dependencies?
[19:59:49] <robertmaxrees> plugins or anything you've included?
[20:00:05] <Darmani> yeah a few, a bootstrap framework...
[20:00:32] <robertmaxrees> what else?
[20:00:59] <Darmani> Well the rest of it is backend stuff. Kaminari (for pagination), Sidekiq for CRON jobs...
[20:01:09] <Darmani> Nothing to do with jquery or js.
[20:01:22] <robertmaxrees> you said "a bootstrap framework" - which one?
[20:01:40] <Darmani> bootstrap-sass
[20:01:42] <Darmani> https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass
[20:01:47] <robertmaxrees> okay, so bootstrap.
[20:02:04] <robertmaxrees> sounds like something slipped in to the project.
[20:02:20] <Darmani> Let me paste the console
[20:02:34] <robertmaxrees> the console?
[20:02:35] <robertmaxrees> wut
[20:02:39] <robertmaxrees> why not the page source?
[20:02:51] <Darmani> robertmaxrees: https://gist.github.com/mfifth/c31432aa05ae81f0b7eb11e15383aeed#file-console_log
[20:02:56] <Darmani> I can do that too..
[20:03:00] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean anything to me fwiw.
[20:03:22] <Darmani> oh wait
[20:03:27] <Darmani> turbolinks is here....
[20:03:34] <robertmaxrees> heh
[20:03:45] <Darmani> fucking christ I didn't add that
[20:04:00] <robertmaxrees> pretty sure it's a default thing.
[20:04:04] <robertmaxrees> but i don't know RoR.
[20:04:09] <robertmaxrees> anyway, i gotta jet.
[20:04:10] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[20:04:12] <Darmani> well shit. That has to be the reason
[20:04:18] <Darmani> Lol thanks man.
[22:04:23] <Me1of1> hey there! can someone please help me how to correct this? https://jsfiddle.net/kfuf6wfc/ I dont thing `.function(){...` is the correct way to go about this
[22:08:01] <Me1of1> someone please ?:-/
