[00:05:43] * AdamPDotty sends bot-t after lucasw
[00:33:14] <granden> Hello, anyone here who have used masonry? I got a question, probably stupid because but still, can I detect when it have rearanged my items and is done?
[00:38:34] <DarkSector> Hi, I am supposed to pass an array of all the values of checked checkboxes as an argument to my ajax call. But I am unable to figure it out. I tried <a href="javascript://" onclick="Sijax.request('final',[$('#final input[type=\'checkbox\']').attr('checked',true )]);> but I don't get the values. Is there a way I can have the arguments retrieved in a single line of code?	
[00:39:39] <DarkSector> e.g. then my call can be like sijax_req = final sijax_args = 'a', 'b', 'c' .. and my server can handle the list
[00:47:04] <cocomo> !
[00:47:54] <AdamPDotty> DarkSector, have a look at serialize()!
[00:55:18] <Brackets> lo all
[00:55:33] <Brackets> noob question: why doesn't this work: $("button").disabled = "disabled";
[00:59:15] <AdamPDotty> $() is a jQuery set, not an element
[00:59:30] <Brackets> it can't change every element in the set?
[00:59:36] <Brackets> sorry, I know this is probably very stupid
[00:59:39] <AdamPDotty> it has no attribute disabeld afaik
[00:59:50] <toxz> are they working on the jquery-ui site? http://download.jqueryui.com/download
[00:59:56] <AdamPDotty> it can but you have to use available functions
[01:00:17] <AdamPDotty> not non-existing attributes
[01:01:26] <Brackets> ok, thanks
[01:01:31] <Brackets> will try to work this out
[01:04:11] <funka> Brackets, look at the attr() method under api.jquery.com
[01:04:51] <funka> what you want to do is grab a set (using the $(â€¦) constructor) and then set all the "disabled" attrtibutes ("attr") to false or unchecked
[01:05:26] <funka> like, $('#btn').attr('disabled', 'disabled'), or whatever
[01:05:31] <funka> i'm actually not sure if that's right
[01:05:39] <funka> hence the "or whatever"
[01:05:54] <funka> or you can loop through each element in the set using $.each
[01:06:15] <AdamPDotty> as its more than one element, an ID is unlikely
[01:06:26] <funka> in which case, using DOM property "disabled", you'd set to  boolean true or false,  not that string
[01:06:39] <AdamPDotty> 'disabled' and false work both, right?
[01:06:48] <funka> one as an attr, the other as a prop
[01:07:20] <funka> think of how you access it in an HTML tag via when you play with the DOM in javascript
[01:07:35] <funka> *versus* i mean,n ot via
[01:08:18] <funka> good luck Brackets!
[01:08:35] <AdamPDotty> hmm, but attr() does not influence the value you get with getAttribute()
[01:10:10] <pHero> hello jquery, i've got this: $('[name=project]').change(function(event) {...}, can i somehow trigger this change event? .trigger('change') does nothing (
[01:10:28] <Brackets> thanks all, will work on this for a bit and come back if I still can't work it out
[01:11:03] <Cork> pHero: trigger should work as long as your doing it on the same element
[01:11:21] <pHero> I am... hmm
[01:11:38] <Cork> pHero: remember that $('').change only works for the elements that existed when it ran
[01:12:00] <zsoc> pHero, yeah since it's a bind shortcut, you have to do it in the right order
[01:12:12] <pHero> all my code is in document.ready
[01:12:18] <Cork> doesn't matter
[01:12:22] <zsoc> doesn't matter
[01:12:28] <zsoc> still happens in order, this isn't php :p
[01:12:30] <AdamPDotty> nearly matters :-)
[01:12:49] <pHero> ok ill try swaping function and trigger
[01:12:51] <Cork> pHero: doeument.ready is called when the page first loads
[01:12:51] <zsoc> AdamPDotty, all i can say is trying to trigger something that wasn't bound yet drove me crazy yesterday lol
[01:12:58] <Cork> not each time the page is modified
[01:13:32] <zsoc> Cork, yeah but if it's binded then it only have to be called once...
[01:13:40] <zsoc> is that how you guys say it? Binded? or Bound?
[01:13:48] <Cork> bound
[01:13:50] <pHero> wow, its working! thanks guys
[01:13:59] <AdamPDotty> know your bounds
[01:14:05] <zsoc> pHero, yeah, imagine doing that 20 minutes from now, that was me yesterday haha
[01:14:10] * AdamPDotty blames Cork
[01:14:14] <pHero> cool :)
[01:14:39] <zsoc> It's sort of important you know /why/ it works now tho, if you plan on using jquery any amount in the future
[01:15:35] <pHero> heh
[01:15:38] <pHero> ill get to that someday
[01:15:41] <pHero> when i finish this :)
[01:15:47] <zsoc> :)
[01:16:36] <Lucky--> question: I code with asp.net and it comes with an auto minify, and concatenate feature for your css/js files. How would say requirejs compare in page load times with it? would it be worth installing nodes just to have to manually compile my closures?
[01:17:00] <Lucky--> *node
[01:17:17] <bluesm> hey.
[01:17:27] <bluesm> $('<div/>');
[01:17:37] <bluesm> Mean that element should be self closed ? Yeap ?
[01:18:01] <zsoc> bluesm, you can not self close a div
[01:18:08] <zsoc> well, not in html 4.x at least
[01:20:17] <AdamPDotty> Are you sure, zsoc?
[01:20:48] <bluesm> zsoc: But what is the difference between $('<div>'); and $('<div/>');
[01:21:26] <zsoc> AdamPDotty, not only am I sure, but I've researched it quite extensively. You can force it by declaring the right xhtml doctype but any current common browser versions just treat it like it's not closed
[01:21:47] <zsoc> AdamPDotty, maybe what I should say is in /practice/ it doesn't work
[01:22:18] <AdamPDotty> as I read <div /> has no useful meaning in html but is still valid
[01:22:46] <seutje> doctypes are essentially worthless
[01:22:50] <zsoc> AdamPDotty, yes, it validates. But it does not actually self close. It will be treated as unclosed and generally break your formatting with other divs
[01:22:53] <zsoc> seutje, i agree there too
[01:23:01] <zsoc> meanwhile i think this has nothing to do with that guys question haha
[01:23:48] <AdamPDotty> I do not know his answer. Still I would be surprised, if there were a difference
[01:25:39] <zsoc> "Tags that cannot contain elements may be quick-closed or not" taken from jquery.com
[01:26:07] <zsoc> says nothing about tags that /can/ contain elements. I imagine it will work the same but it's not suggested for compatibility purposes.
[01:26:22] <zsoc> "To ensure cross-platform compatibility" ya
[01:26:52] <Cork> bluesm: jquery special case those two strings, and yes they generate the same thing
[01:27:17] <Cork> bluesm: the /> is just if you prefer that for readability
[01:27:53] <bluesm1> Cork: So for what is the <div/> ?
[01:27:59] <Cork> bluesm: but as soon as you start adding anything more then a single tag in the string, its parsed as an html fragment
[01:27:59] <bluesm1> If this is the same thing ?
[01:28:08] <Cork> bluesm1: when you give it to jquery, just a string
[01:28:12] <boulet101010_> how to retrieve a list of the checked inputs values?
[01:28:14] <Cork> it regex matches the <>
[01:28:29] <zsoc|sleep> speaking of which, i assume it's pcre?
[01:28:40] <Cork> bluesm1: and does document.createElement(middle-section)
[01:29:16] <Cork> bluesm1: the <div/> is derived from xhtml's close tag solution, but doesn't mean anything in html
[01:29:52] <Cork> ?g mdn regex @ zsoc|sleep
[01:29:55] <bot-t> zsoc|sleep, Regular Expressions | JavaScript | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions
[01:30:21] <zsoc|sleep> ty
[01:30:36] <Cork> boulet101010: $('input[type="checkbox"]:checked')
[01:31:23] <boulet101010_> a list of the values
[01:31:27] <boulet101010_> Cork,
[01:31:37] <Cork> boulet101010: $('input[type="checkbox"]:checked').serializeArray()
[01:31:42] <boulet101010_> ok ty ;)
[01:32:27] <Cork> or $.map($('input[type="checkbox"]:checked'), function(elm) { return $(elm).val(); })
[01:32:36] <bluesm1> Cork: So this is only for backward compatibility ?
[01:32:44] <Cork> no
[01:32:53] <Cork> it has nothing to do with backwards compatibility
[01:33:05] <Cork> its the syntax for creating an element in jquery
[01:33:18] <Cork> its a fast track compared to doing a full documentfragment
[01:34:06] <jacta> http://jsfiddle.net/phoenix_suresh/7f6j5/ how can I do so its possible to toggle on multiple choises - right now it works when selecting multiple rows without ctrl - cant figure out how to do it the other way - or make smart - just toggle it
[01:34:06] <Roggger> hello people. I need a colon in my url but seems like rails is ignoring it. This is my route: https://gist.github.com/3857370 I searched over internet and nothing about colons in url :-\
[01:34:37] <Cork> Roggger: => #RubyOnRails
[01:34:48] <Roggger> ups, sorry
[01:34:59] <Cork> Roggger: but tecnically its invalid
[01:35:06] <Cork> you need to escape the character
[01:35:34] <Cork> %3A is what you want
[01:36:54] <ThLoser> Can anyone help me with my progressbar? http://jsfiddle.net/dUM9Y/ Iam trying to get it to reset but i dont know how :(
[01:37:05] <Tram> Hello All, could anyone explain me why bind/trigger does not work here: http://jsfiddle.net/MartvanKoolwijk/6hHxP/  ??
[01:37:13] <Roggger> thanks Cork but it's not as easy
[01:37:16] <Roggger> :_(
[01:40:19] <Cork> ThLoser: whats wrong with .progressbar({ value: 0 }); ?
[01:40:24] <faraway> ThLoser: what is the problem with the reset ?
[01:41:08] <ThLoser> faraway: I have settimeouts to get it to get longer every 100 millisecond. And when i press reset, it doesn't disable the old timers so i get new timers and then it goes fast like hell :P
[01:41:33] <faraway> ThLoser: then do a clearTimeout ;)
[01:41:48] <ThLoser> clearTimeout what? :P
[01:41:49] <Cork> that will have a race condition though
[01:41:56] <Cork> the updateProgress function
[01:41:57] <ThLoser> Should i just use cleartimeout();
[01:42:04] <Cork> clearTimeout(updateProgress);
[01:42:12] <ThLoser> oh ok i will try this brb :P
[01:42:18] <Cork> that will have a race condition though <--
[01:42:23] <faraway> ThLoser: setTimeout returns a id the created Timeout with this id and clearTimeout you can stop the timeout
[01:43:13] <ThLoser> fara, but then i should have like 100 id's ?
[01:43:22] <ThLoser> Because the set timeout is in a loop
[01:43:40] <Cork> ya, but you don't need the id as you have a function pointer
[01:43:47] <Cork> both works
[01:43:53] <axscode> how can i do... wildecard on selection like $("#edit-attributes-* , excep[edit-attributes-9]")
[01:44:03] <Cork> axscode: use a class
[01:44:24] <ThLoser> Cork: : That didnt work
[01:44:30] <jacta> http://jsfiddle.net/phoenix_suresh/7f6j5/ how can I do so its possible to toggle on multiple choises - right now it works when selecting multiple rows without ctrl - cant figure out how to do it the other way - or make smart - just toggle it
[01:44:35] <Cork> axscode: if you need wildcards in your id selectors your doing it wrong
[01:44:38] <shoky> cork wtf you can pass a function?
[01:44:51] <Cork> shoky: yes
[01:45:25] <ThLoser> Cork: its the same error still, it goes faster and faster
[01:45:27] <axscode> cork, thats why im asking actually how..
[01:45:37] <axscode> really dont ahve a clue how to do it
[01:46:10] <faraway> Cork: just cause i'm curios and slightly exhausted. where is the race condition
[01:46:42] <shoky> Cork: doesnt seem to be working for me.. you got any doc for it?
[01:46:55] <Cork> ?g mdn clearTimeout
[01:46:57] <bot-t> Cork, window.clearTimeout | Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/window.clearTimeout
[01:47:03] <jacta> Can anyone help me toggle a class correct? Did this now: http://jsfiddle.net/7f6j5/49/
[01:47:11] <shoky> Cork: yep...
[01:47:58] <Cork> shoky: hmm, funny that its not...
[01:48:11] <ThLoser> Think i solved it
[01:48:20] <Tram> Hello All, could anyone explain me why bind/trigger does not work here: http://jsfiddle.net/MartvanKoolwijk/6hHxP/1/
[01:48:24] <shoky> not working, not documented, what's up Cork ;]
[01:48:43] <Cork> faraway: clearTimeout can trigger while the other function is executing, making it trigger a new setTimeout after clearTimeout triggers it
[01:48:53] <Cork> shoky: one min i need to answer these questions first
[01:49:10] <shoky> np i'm mostly teasing anyway
[01:49:15] <shoky> MOSTLY
[01:51:13] <jacta> can anyone help me with toggleclass? :\
[01:51:17] <_slax0r_> Hi, I might be in the wrong channel, but don't know where to run to with this issue. So anyway, I have jqGrid, http://pastebin.com/amKUmDcd, and it's getting it's JSON "feed" from this PHP function: http://pastebin.com/cSMZ3UVn, which generated this JSON string: http://pastebin.com/XUNAC0Ws but for some reason I cannot see, the table remains empty, can anyone help?
[01:52:37] <AdamPDotty> jacta: should not it "be event, ui" ?
[01:52:49] <ozette> where do I find the archive with older versions of jquery (always troubled with finding it)
[01:53:28] <jacta> AdamPDotty, ah- your're right! Updated, maybe im a bit lost? http://jsfiddle.net/7f6j5/50/
[01:53:31] <Cork> shoky: interesting... that apparently changed
[01:53:44] <Cork> it used to work way back, but it doesn't now...
[01:54:41] <shoky> i was js'ing ~10 years ago, dont remember ever seeing that. (not that i dont believe you)
[01:55:10] <shoky> (i just think you're mental)
[01:55:20] <shoky> (all of you)
[01:55:29] * shoky dies
[01:56:05] <faraway> shoky: ;)
[01:59:20] <faraway> jacta: what is the problem with your code ?
[02:00:01] <faraway> jacta: btw is there a special reason why you use jquery 1.4.4 ?
[02:00:31] <jacta> faraway, I want to make it able to toggle them, so if I mark 1-4 and after that marks 3-5 it should toggle 3-4 to not selected and 5 to selected - no reason, dunno why that one is taken - do you get my question?
[02:01:42] <faraway> jacta: oh ok now i know what you are asking
[02:01:56] <jacta> good start ;-)
[02:02:04] <jacta> im prolly a bad asker ;)
[02:02:15] <computer2000> pls help: i need to loop through a UL and fade in each element one after another in 250ms interval ...
[02:04:18] <computer2000> http://pastebin.com/ysPp7fU3 wont work cause there is no delay between each loop
[02:06:21] <shoky> computer2000: a quick solution:  http://pastebin.com/59ugGui3
[02:07:11] <ThLoser> If i want a var with two zeros in it how should i do then?
[02:07:23] <ThLoser> var x = progress00
[02:07:32] <computer2000> shoky: THX
[02:07:37] <computer2000> nice trick
[02:08:44] <faraway> jacta: hmm , you mean, that if you make a "drag" selection with the meta key, that then the one that where selected get unselected ? (also a bad question ;) )
[02:08:58] <shoky> ThLoser:  a var with two zeros?
[02:09:05] <shoky> elaborate..
[02:09:06] <jacta> faraway, yep, and the other way around ;)
[02:09:15] <ThLoser> If the var progress is 1 i want the var x to be 100
[02:09:24] <shoky> * 100  ?
[02:09:27] <faraway> jacta: well thee other way round already works form the jquery-ui :D
[02:10:02] <jacta> aah yep :p
[02:10:12] <ThLoser> shoky:  that worked almost
[02:10:28] <jacta> faraway,  sure hehe- but then drag over selected items to de-select
[02:12:04] <faraway> jacta: problem is that either with selecting or selected callbak you have the problem that jquery ui overrides it later ... so i think at "start" you need to check which one are selected, and track the one that get selected via the "selected" callback and do the cleanup at stop.
[02:12:05] <shoky> ThLoser:  + '00'   ?
[02:12:11] <faraway> jacta: but thats just a guess
[02:12:37] <ThLoser> shoky:  it worked but the progressbar isn't synced with the image swap
[02:12:44] <pedda> hi all
[02:12:46] <shoky> ThLoser: riiiight..
[02:12:55] <faraway> jacta: probably this helps you to find a solution ... i don't know the selectable good enough to give a real solution
[02:12:58] <pedda> how can i apply a negative left position to an element via jquery ?
[02:13:01] <shoky> ThLoser: that has so much to do with a var with two zeros in it.
[02:13:07] <faraway> pedda: yes
[02:13:17] <pedda> left: '-200' doesn't work in my case
[02:13:17] <shoky> g'night
[02:13:22] <jacta> faraway, thanks anyways ;)
[02:14:52] <faraway> pedda: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/tJJ88/
[02:15:11] <pedda> hmm
[02:15:42] <pedda> i'm trying to apply this as a css property for a slide within cycle2 plugin
[02:16:22] <mazzachre> Well jqueryui.DatePicker also trigger the "change" event on the input element it is bound to?
[02:16:28] <_slax0r_> Hi, I might be in the wrong channel, but don't know where to run to with this issue. So anyway, I have jqGrid, http://pastebin.com/amKUmDcd, and it's getting it's JSON "feed" from this PHP function: http://pastebin.com/cSMZ3UVn, which generated this JSON string: http://pastebin.com/XUNAC0Ws but for some reason I cannot see, the table remains empty, can anyone help?
[02:23:10] <faraway> pedda: i would guess the plugin is overwriting your value to do the sliding
[02:23:30] <pedda> not really
[02:23:34] <atan> Anyone in here freelance and available for hire?
[02:23:44] <pedda> i should have been tried the negative value without the quotes :P
[02:23:55] <pedda> this did the trick :)

[02:28:14] <DarsVaeda> in jquery 1.4 how do I reset a form input field?
[02:30:29] <wunderCatze> I guess it's universal $("txt_input").text = ""; but not sure
[02:30:48] <wunderCatze> or $("txt_input").text("");
[02:32:17] <anli> $("input[type=text]").text("");
[02:32:20] <anli> oops
[02:32:24] <anli> $("input[type=text]").val("");
[02:32:44] <wunderCatze> I think text() works the same as val if accepted
[02:32:51] <anli> But I do not
[02:33:03] <seutje> yeah, I don't either
[02:33:07] <anli> :)
[02:33:12] <wunderCatze> :)
[02:33:16] <faraway> DarkSector: you want to reset it to the default value ?
[02:33:33] <DarkSector> faraway: no no just get the values and pas it with the request
[02:34:03] <wunderCatze> then use val()
[02:34:04] <seutje> use .val() without quotes then
[02:34:10] <wunderCatze> yep

[03:01:35] <greek> Hi how do I set the selected option based on the option's text?
[03:01:39] <seutje> I hate collision detection
[03:01:53] <axscode> http://jsfiddle.net/SpSjL/451/ <-- how can i attain this as step-up and step-down using below button instead of exsiting dropdown
[03:01:54] <greek> Or if it's easier, it's always the first option in the list, so perhaps there's a way to set it by index?
[03:02:03] <Krambiorix> hey , this doesn't work , row.find("td")[j].css("backgroundColor")  -> what would work?
[03:02:44] <clocKwize> so, I have a textarea in a table cell, if I .show() it in chrome, it sets in display: inline-block; if I .show() it in firefox, it sets display: block; -- I have text-align: center; so in firefox, the box appears left, as its a block element, but in chrome its in the center of the cell! How can I get around this?
[03:03:48] <pedda> thx faraway got my slideshow finished :)
[03:05:12] <seutje> Krambiorix: [j] returns a reference to a DOM element, not a jQuery collection, so you cannoy perform jQuery methods on it
[03:05:27] <seutje> ?eq @ Krambiorix
[03:05:31] <Krambiorix> seutje, leuke naam trouwens :row.find("td:eq("+j+")").css("backgroundColor")
[03:05:36] <Krambiorix> zoiets?
[03:06:28] <seutje> Krambiorix: it's generally advised to use non-sizzle specific selectors and instead use the methods like eq, splice, ...
[03:06:46] <seutje> row.find('td').eq(j).css(...)
[03:07:00] <Krambiorix> seutje, thx
[03:07:08] <faraway> pedda: ^^ well i just told you that it works ... the bug you found yourself ;)
[03:07:30] <pedda> indeed, rubber duck debugging ^^

[03:10:58] <faraway> Kemito: jquery ui elements have a destroy method
[03:11:35] <seutje> Kemito: should exclude that one before initializing it, tbh
[03:11:52] <seutje> kinda silly to execute it on all and then destroy it on a few
[03:12:42] <seutje> that's sorta like "I'ma paint all my walls in yellow, and then over-paint this one wall in red", nobody does that, u'd just end up with an orange wall if ur not careful anyway
[03:12:51] <Kemito> jQuery(".request-button").button("destroy"); not work for me
[03:13:45] <faraway> seutje:  i think you should keep answering instead of me ... it's not may day ^^ and i should check if my walls are orange :D
[03:14:50] <Krambiorix> with jquery i change the backgroundcolor of a cell. That works, but just after that in another function i check which backgroundcolor the cell has and i see it didn't change... Help?
[03:15:47] <angelazou> hi I have a troubling snippet here http://jsfiddle.net/QzD3w/
[03:16:18] <angelazou> in every grey box is there a sentence and available choices for the empty spot in the sentence
[03:16:44] <angelazou> when I first initiate the script, I create 2 p tags for sentences that are broken in the middle
[03:17:11] <angelazou> and every time I click on a choice, the animate function should apply on both of these p elements
[03:17:21] <angelazou> however, I only want the verification process to be done once
[03:17:43] <angelazou> I'm having trouble trying to figure out this
[03:23:36] <seutje> Krambiorix: gonna need an example, works fine for me
[03:28:03] <CrawfordComeaux> Looking for suggestions on how to go about building something like this: http://www.tinyuploads.com/images/8128Oe.png
[03:30:41] <CrawfordComeaux> I'm trying to create a regex-generator similar to txt2re.com, except more interactive & user-friendly. The idea is to have users create those shaded areas to identify certain pieces of text
[03:31:19] <seutje> angelazou: use the promise! http://jsfiddle.net/QzD3w/1/
[03:32:10] <code_ph0y> hey guys how do you remove every child element from a container
[03:32:12] <TheBrayn> I have some checkboxes inside a click toggled element, how can I make their click priority higher to not close the element?
[03:32:29] <code_ph0y> say for example a div with an id of .... example?
[03:33:29] <seutje> $('#example').remove();
[03:33:37] <CrawfordComeaux> code_ph0y: $('#myid').remove();
[03:33:41] <CrawfordComeaux> bah
[03:33:47] <code_ph0y> will that not remove the div as well but?
[03:34:03] <seutje> oh u want every child element gone, my bad
[03:34:10] <seutje> does that include textnodes?
[03:34:28] <seutje> $('#example').html(''); I guess
[03:34:29] <code_ph0y> everything i want it to be empty
[03:34:43] <CrawfordComeaux> code_ph0y: $('#myid').empty();
[03:34:56] <seutje> TheBrayn: u want a click on a certain child element to not trigger the event handler?
[03:35:09] <seutje> CrawfordComeaux: oh, right lol, prolly better
[03:35:16] <TheBrayn> yes
[03:35:22] <code_ph0y> so <div id="example">bla bla bla bla bla</div> to be .... <div id="example"></div>
[03:35:40] <seutje> I guess html('') doesn't remove event handlers and shit
[03:36:11] <CrawfordComeaux> seutje: I was typing the .html() version out & remembered .empty() :P
[03:36:17] <CrawfordComeaux> doesn't it?
[03:36:29] <code_ph0y> nice guys let me try!
[03:36:51] <pedda> can someone tell me, how to combine this: http://visionmedia.github.com/move.js/ with a callback function of jquery ?
[03:37:14] <jlebrech> how do I add a .on() event for "keyup", "keydown" and "change"?
[03:37:27] <pedda> i want to 'move.js' something after within a jquery callback
[03:39:11] <CrawfordComeaux> seutje: any thoughts on how I can pull off my little component?
[03:40:25] <seutje> TheBrayn: http://jsfiddle.net/E7stS/ or http://jsfiddle.net/E7stS/1/
[03:40:45] <seutje> TheBrayn: depending on the structure of your stuff, one will be more convenient than the other
[03:41:01] <seutje> TheBrayn: note that the first will eat *ALL* click events on .two
[03:41:26] <code_ph0y> amazing guys thanks!!
[03:41:29] <code_ph0y> its working
[03:41:42] <seutje> CrawfordComeaux: not sure what u're trying to do, but u'll prolly need rangy or something to do proper cross-browser text-range stuffs
[03:41:44] <code_ph0y> lmao! CrawfordComeaux: I have a Kama Sutra book?
[03:41:46] <code_ph0y> :P
[03:41:48] <angelazou> seutje: thanks a lot
[03:42:07] <xec_> jlebrech: first argument to .on() is a space separated list of event keywords
[03:42:09] <angelazou> just one last thing, how can I make a block of code unselectable at all
[03:42:32] <jlebrech> xec_: haha, thanks just read that in the docs this minute :)
[03:42:43] <seutje> ?g html unselectable attribute
[03:42:45] <bot-t> seutje, UNSELECTABLE Attribute (A, ABBR, ACRONYM, ...) - http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537840(v=vs.85).aspx
[03:42:54] <angelazou> thanks
[03:43:52] <seutje> angelazou: actually, I think that's an IE only attribute :x
[03:44:09] <angelazou> ah
[03:44:30] <seutje> angelazou: other browsers use css user-select: none;
[03:44:50] <seutje> with like -webkit-user-select: none; -moz-user-select: -moz-none; (lol wtf, right?)
[03:45:42] <seutje> angelazou: and I think u can also achieve it by preventing the default action on the selectstart event
[03:45:57] <Chel> question: how to avoid $.fn.extend method overloading problems ?
[03:46:00] <angelazou> I'll double check, thanks a bunch ;)
[03:48:00] <angelazou> interestingly, there is actually a -ms-user-select attribute
[03:51:44] <seutje> angelazou: ah, that's prolly for IE9 and up :P
[03:52:04] <seutje> angelazou: anyway, this is prolly a rather cross-browser safe solution: http://jsfiddle.net/3E2ve/
[03:52:40] <seutje> angelazou: more performant event binding: http://jsfiddle.net/3E2ve/1/ :D
[04:27:58] <CrawfordComeaux> seutje: just realized that what I'm looking to do already exists in google spreadsheets
[04:30:21] <oltrirc> ciao !list
[04:33:00] <wunderCatze> hello, is there a complementary function to document.createElement() ??
[04:35:09] <wunderCatze> is there a document.destroyElement() function?
[04:35:34] <AdamPDotty> removeChild
[04:35:46] <AdamPDotty> once its in the dom
[04:36:00] <AdamPDotty> else element = null;
[04:36:39] <reloadz> hi! i need help makeing correct selector
[04:38:18] <wunderCatze> it doesnt works this is:
[04:38:19] <wunderCatze> if ($("canvas")) {
[04:38:19] <wunderCatze>             document.removeChild($("canvas"));
[04:38:19] <wunderCatze>         }
[04:38:44] <wunderCatze> I am missing something here?
[04:38:52] <xec_> $("canvas").remove() ?
[04:38:59] <AdamPDotty> its probably no child of document
[04:39:06] <AdamPDotty> with jquery thers remove, yes
[04:39:11] <wunderCatze> nope
[04:39:17] <wunderCatze> it doesn works
[04:39:54] <reloadz> $(class).parents(class).attr("asdasd", "asdasd"); -- it makes changes to ".parents(class)", but it needs to be made on "$(class)"
[04:39:59] <xec_> wunderCatze: what exactly is your use case?
[04:40:05] <AdamPDotty> canvas is not a known element
[04:40:32] <wunderCatze> the canvas element was created with document.createElement("canvas")
[04:40:40] <wunderCatze> this is happening in a function
[04:40:47] <AdamPDotty> errrm
[04:40:50] <wunderCatze> when I call again that function
[04:40:50] <AdamPDotty> and that works?
[04:40:52] <xec_> reloadz: then don't do .parents(class) ?
[04:41:07] <wunderCatze> I want to check if there is some canvas, and if it is, remove it and create another one
[04:41:21] <wunderCatze> because if I do not do this, canvas elements will be keep creating
[04:41:30] <reloadz> i need to use it! i use same $("class") under different parent also...!
[04:42:27] <xec_> reloadz: give us a sample of your html and a set of rules for what should happen
[04:42:34] <AdamPDotty> now its gets complicated, so you should create a test case
[04:43:36] <wunderCatze> here is a part of non-runnable code: http://pastebin.com/2P9ipjWr
[04:45:14] <xec_> wunderCatze: have you tried $("canvas").remove() ?
[04:45:19] <ablomen> wunderCatze, first of all, $("canvas") will always return true (it always returns a jquery object) second $("canvas").remove()
[04:45:19] <wunderCatze> yes
[04:46:05] <ablomen> so use if ($("canvas")[0]) { instead
[04:46:23] <xec_> no, use .length
[04:46:29] <wunderCatze> ?
[04:46:41] <wunderCatze> $("canvas").length > 0 ?
[04:46:48] <seutje> > 0 is obsolete
[04:47:16] <wunderCatze> ty!!!
[04:47:17] <seutje> 0 is falsy, anything > 0 is truthy
[04:47:17] <xec_> but there is really no need
[04:47:24] <wunderCatze> works right now
[04:47:26] <ablomen> also ra1 and ra2 are leaking out of the function
[04:47:31] <wunderCatze> works with both cases
[04:47:33] <wunderCatze> what?
[04:47:36] <xec_> s/obsolete/superfluous
[04:47:44] <ablomen> you did not declare them with var
[04:47:48] <wunderCatze> ra1 and ra2 are not global
[04:47:56] <seutje> execuz mi anglesh, nat sow gut!
[04:47:57] <wunderCatze> yes, I missed there the "var", ty
[04:48:42] <ablomen> xec_, what's the difference?
[04:48:42] <xec_> wunderCatze: .remove() on an empty collection just won't do anything, so you don't need the check.
[04:48:57] <ablomen> between [0] and .length i mean
[04:49:14] <ablomen> if you just want to check if there is at least one el
[04:50:20] <reloadz> xec_: http://jsfiddle.net/6uhq4/
[04:50:28] <wunderCatze> [0] is obsolete
[04:51:21] <xec_> reloadz: http://jsfiddle.net/6uhq4/1/
[04:52:47] <reloadz> xec_: KILL ME!
[04:53:03] * xec_ stabs reloadz with a plastic spork
[04:53:23] * xec_ 's attack is ineffective, reloadz takes 0 damage.
[04:53:36] * AdamPDotty rolls 2d12
[04:53:42] <reloadz> :D
[04:54:37] <xec_> where's my titanium spork when i need it? :P
[04:56:06] <code_ph0y> hey guys can you do $(this).getElement('span'); ?
[04:56:12] <code_ph0y> or something to that effect?
[04:56:31] <AdamPDotty> like $(this).find('span'); ?
[04:56:33] <xec_> maybe you want .find() ?
[04:56:55] <xec_> depending on what the "this" is
[04:57:07] <xec_> and what you're trying to do
[05:12:45] <cibs> \quit
[05:12:48] <cibs> sorry

[05:28:43] <greek> Hi we need a rich text editor in a text area. Is there a best practise jquery plugin?
[05:30:23] <angelazou> greek: not sure what do you mean by a best practice plugin, but you can always rely on a popular plugin for regular update and higher security practice
[05:32:05] <iSeeDeadPixels> greek: tinymce

[05:36:08] <defaude> Hey folks :)
[05:36:36] <defaude> I've got a small question regarding jQuery 1.7.2 and IE8
[05:36:54] <defaude> someone listening? ;)
[05:37:48] <libG> i'm having an issue with jQuery UI position in webkit browsers, is it ok to ask about it on this channel?
[05:39:42] <faraway> defaude, libG: just ask
[05:40:31] <defaude> alright here we go. Let's say I've got an <img ...> somewhere and want to show / hide some stuff next to it
[05:40:40] <defaude> I'm using jQuery's .hover
[05:40:50] <defaude> it works just fine in proper browsers
[05:41:17] <defaude> something like this
[05:41:38] <defaude> $('#my-img').hover(showStuff, hideStuff)
[05:41:40] <faraway> defaude: can you make a small sample here : http://jsfiddle.net/
[05:41:48] <defaude> on my way
[05:41:49] <defaude> thanx
[05:42:24] <libG> i'm using jQuery ui position to move an element to near its grandparent, on hover of its parent
[05:42:35] <libG> this works fine on all browsers except webkit
[05:42:50] <libG> on first hover it moves to the correct vertical alignment
[05:43:06] <libG> but it's not until another hover that the horizontal alignment catches up
[05:43:46] <iSeeDeadPixels> frikkin' IE not running anything at all if there's a teeny tiny script error, what in the name of shitfuck IE :|
[05:45:14] <faraway> libG: if you can create a samll  http://jsfiddle.net/  that shows the problem it is always easy to guess what is going wrong
[05:45:40] <libG> working on it :)
[05:46:02] <greek> Hi is it possible to force a jquery script to puase execution until an ajax call has returned its output?
[05:46:19] <greek> I need to call a couple of ajax calls in succession
[05:46:41] <greek> Unfortunately I'm dealing with a bad design where I can't move the logic to one ajax target script
[05:46:56] <faraway> greek: that would result into a not responding browser ... but thats why jquery does ajax calls async
[05:47:33] <faraway> greek: you can force sync (blocking) requests ... but you REALY should not do this. do you really should change the design of the code
[05:47:41] <iSeeDeadPixels> http://jsfiddle.net/8QdDp/ try this in IE with show script errors on...
[05:48:03] <greek> faraway, yeah ok will do.
[05:49:02] <faraway> iSeeDeadPixels: first of all add the radix parameter to parseInt, otherwise you could get unexpected results in converting numbers
[05:49:11] <iSeeDeadPixels> radix?
[05:49:45] <faraway> iSeeDeadPixels: parseInt ('0', 10);   (10=for decimal system)
[05:49:52] <defaude> http://jsfiddle.net/jdEfm/ <== there you go. IE8 is even too stupid to run jfiddle itself ;) however, my problem is not showing in this simple example. gotta dig deeper
[05:50:20] <defaude> but thank you anyways
[05:50:23] <greek> faraway, ok I've found a way to call the ajax scripts asynchronously, the only risk is that there are potentially up to 15 simultaneous ajax taking place. Is that bad?
[05:50:24] <faraway> iSeeDeadPixels: otherwise it could happen that you accidentally parse as oct
[05:51:07] <mazzachre> Can I attach event listeners to document?
[05:51:23] <greek> I do have the option of redesigning it even further so that it's only 1 ajax call but that's a bit more involved
[05:51:28] <faraway> greek: well the only risk is that you need to take care that your code handels them in the correct order .. or "waits" for some responses
[05:51:54] <iSeeDeadPixels> faraway: doing that, but IE kinda stops executing the jQ when it hits an error.
[05:52:03] <greek> faraway, it's ok if they're done in parallel, there's no I/O blocking taking place
[05:52:28] <greek> faraway, I'm more curious about the theoretical limit in the number of simultaneous ajax calls
[05:52:45] <faraway> greek: then it should be no problem cause browsers anyway do only a certain number of requests in parallel
[05:53:09] <greek> faraway, ok so the ones that aren't executed in parallel enter some kind of queue?
[05:53:18] <greek> faraway, in other words, they're always executed
[05:53:22] <faraway> greek: the rest is in a queue (but that is handle by the browser)
[05:53:26] <greek> awesome
[05:53:28] <faraway> greek: exactly
[05:53:36] <greek> thanks for the tips
[05:53:48] <faraway> greek: mobild browsers often do only one request a time
[05:54:09] <faraway> greek: but really depends on browser on system, but as long as you don't have long polling requests that should be no problem
[05:54:32] <greek> each request takes a couple hundred milliseconds at most
[05:55:09] <faraway> iSeeDeadPixels: well you can always use try catch blocks to avoid  certain situations.
[05:56:07] <libG> http://jsfiddle.net/jdEfm/3/  Hover on expertise then partners to see issue with horizontal alignment
[05:57:56] <iSeeDeadPixels> faraway: changed all the radix stuff and still have some errors left
[05:58:06] <iSeeDeadPixels> faraway: http://jsfiddle.net/8QdDp/3/
[05:59:07] <faraway> libG: looks fine in chrome
[05:59:47] <cusco> hey folks
[06:00:14] <MrJones> hi
[06:00:24] <iSeeDeadPixels> libG: http://jsfiddle.net/jdEfm/4/
[06:00:28] <iSeeDeadPixels> looks fine in IE.
[06:00:30] <cusco> I can use .children() to iterate trough ieach input on a form, but I would like to create a array, do I have a i that auto increments?
[06:01:00] <cusco> I would like to have arr[0] = input0.value; arr[1] = input1.value; so on so forth
[06:01:00] <MrJones> for a jquery sortable containing a sortable item which contains a small clickable image (beside other things), can I disable dragging on just that image so it can be clicked more easily? (moving just the mouse one pixel during the click which happens quite often will drag instead of click)
[06:01:10] <iSeeDeadPixels> cusco: form.serialize();
[06:01:33] <libG> faraway: really? did you see my above description of how it is behaving for me?
[06:01:42] <cusco> ok let me have a look
[06:02:36] <jacta> Can anyone help me with a thing, I have this code, and when the "pictureframe" is open - if the window get dragged it should resize to max viewpoint - and also resize images to that - http://jsfiddle.net/UNcUA/
[06:02:41] <jacta> can anyone help me out here?
[06:03:19] <faraway> libG: yes i read it, but probably i didn't understand it correctly
[06:03:36] <faraway> libG: which webkit browser (version) do you have a problem with ?
[06:05:05] <cusco> iSeeDeadPixels: seems to come empty. Im using console.log($(document.getElementById(id)).serialize());
[06:05:05] <cusco> where id is the form's id
[06:05:23] <cusco> ow and it produces a query string.. I really ne a array
[06:05:36] <cusco> because I want custom properties on each input
[06:05:36] <iSeeDeadPixels> cusco
[06:05:41] <iSeeDeadPixels> lemme try smth
[06:06:00] <libG> faraway: win 7 chrome 22.0.1229.79 and win 7 safari 5.1.7
[06:07:33] <wunderCatze> how can I open javascript console on firefox?
[06:08:11] <AdamPDotty> ctrl-shift-j
[06:09:57] <libG> faraway: the jsfiddle may not have updated fully, try again now please :)
[06:10:29] <faraway> libG: send me the new link (there is an incrementing number at the end)
[06:10:39] <libG> faraway: http://jsfiddle.net/jdEfm/6/
[06:10:56] <iSeeDeadPixels> cusco: http://jsfiddle.net/9YdNS/
[06:11:01] <iSeeDeadPixels> that should help you
[06:11:25] <iSeeDeadPixels> and you should not use document.getelementbyid, but #id
[06:11:35] <iSeeDeadPixels> $('#id') like that
[06:12:09] <cusco> push
[06:12:11] <cusco> thanks iSeeDeadPixels
[06:12:17] <iSeeDeadPixels> np.
[06:12:37] <cusco> iSeeDeadPixels: actually document.getelementbyid works the same and voids cpu cicles while parsing
[06:12:41] <faraway> libG: ok now i see it
[06:12:52] <iSeeDeadPixels> faraway: well, any ideas on my latest fiddle?
[06:13:10] <Kambfhase> getElementByID has weird bugs in IE ;)
[06:13:41] <libG> faraway: cool :)
[06:13:45] <cusco> iSeeDeadPixels: atcuallyu thats not the arry I want
[06:14:00] <libG> faraway: sorry, not used jsfiddle before
[06:14:13] <iSeeDeadPixels> cusco: yes it is
[06:14:17] <cusco> iSeeDeadPixels: Im looking for arr[0] = {custom:'stuff', value:this.value'}
[06:14:18] <faraway> libG: no problem
[06:14:28] <cusco> and arr[1], 2,3
[06:14:34] * iSeeDeadPixels sighs
[06:14:43] <cusco> err.. sorry im not big on js arrays
[06:15:03] <cusco> can I have ['aa' => {obj},..] ?
[06:15:19] <iSeeDeadPixels> not sure, that is the only easy way i know how to easily add stuff to an array
[06:15:26] <iSeeDeadPixels> it iterates over all form inputs
[06:15:37] <iSeeDeadPixels> and it does as you described?
[06:15:55] <cusco> nop?
[06:16:23] <cusco> maybe .. hold
[06:16:45] <cusco> it does

[06:16:56] <libG> faraway: any ideas? bug or me?
[06:18:56] <faraway> libG: thats really strange ... i would guess it has something to do that the position is probably set before the element was visible
[06:19:25] <Kambfhase> `new Array()` eewww  :S
[06:20:42] <libG> faraway: yeah, what catches me out is that it's fine in non-webkit browsers
[06:20:49] <docmur> Can draggable and resizable boxes be saved on window exit?  I've tried following some guides using layout.save() but when I come back to the page the two panels are always sitting in the default locations
[06:20:53] <Kambfhase> What is it you are trying to do with that 'array' ?
[06:20:53] <libG> faraway: even IE!
[06:22:33] <JillesCode> hey guys, I have 4 divs, and I want to have something like this div1.fadeIn(500) -> wait 3 seconds -> div2.fadeIn(500) -> wait 3 seconds -> etcetc. but I have no clue how to achieve this
[06:24:47] <Kambfhase> JillesCode: .fadeIn() take a callback argument ( a function) that gets executed once the element is completely visible
[06:26:30] <iSeeDeadPixels> faraway: well, any ideas on my latest fiddle?
[06:28:10] <libG> faraway: thanks for your help, think i'm going to log this as a bug
[06:28:42] <faraway> libG: sorry ... can't help you at the moment, i could be a problem of the 100% width in the css but not sure
[06:29:23] <libG> faraway: no worries, i'll have a look at that first
[06:29:24] <libG> faraway: thanks :)

[06:32:15] <iSeeDeadPixels> jsfiddle was slow and did not update as fast as i expected and i kept pressing update xD
[06:32:18] <faraway> libG: i replaced the left and width with fixed values ... seems like this is a problem
[06:32:30] <Kambfhase> iSeeDeadPixels: a) dont use new Array() b) why not use .map() http://jsfiddle.net/9YdNS/7/
[06:32:53] <libG> faraway: have you updated jsfiddle?
[06:32:57] <faraway> libG: i think that first time the percent values are not correctly calcualted by webkit because the menu was not visible at the time the hover is called
[06:33:16] <faraway> libG: http://jsfiddle.net/faraway/jdEfm/7/
[06:33:17] <iSeeDeadPixels> Kambfhase: i only gave my knowledge to the guy, i learned to use new Array()
[06:33:25] <iSeeDeadPixels> anyhow
[06:33:54] <iSeeDeadPixels> http://jsfiddle.net/8QdDp/3/ still some errors left and i have no idea how to properly resolve them
[06:34:19] <libG> faraway: that's fantastic, thank you so much for that :D
[06:35:09] <Kambfhase> Well, today you learn that `new Array()` is a) slow and b) dangerous. Simply use `[]`
[06:35:33] <iSeeDeadPixels> okidokie
[06:36:04] <libG> faraway: i've taken out the top and left, kept the width as a % and that's fixed it in my solution
[06:36:10] <libG> faraway: thanks again :)

[06:41:59] <faraway> prishabh: ^^
[06:42:06] <danheberden> jacta: just make sure you don't repeat to often (i have no idea when you asked before) so just be reasonable with it
[06:42:41] <jacta> danheberden, it was first time - 40 mins ago
[06:42:58] <danheberden> jacta: that sounds reasonable-ish

[06:45:53] <docmur> I can't figure out why this isn't work, actually it "broke" more in jsFiddle but what should of happened is that the box should be full of input's, when I click submit all the inputs for serialize and then I should see that in the alert, when I click sub I don't see any serialized data http://jsfiddle.net/rb2MK/11/
[06:46:48] <Wyn> Can anyone help me with a toggle issue?
[06:47:37] <wunderCatze> ty bot-t! actually, that's something I've been looking for
[06:48:14] <wunderCatze> guys, I am having a TypeError: c.getContext is not a function on the line var ctx = c.getContext('2d');
[06:48:23] <wunderCatze> what the heck is going on?
[06:48:41] <danheberden> wunderCatze: check out what c.getContext is
[06:48:47] <wunderCatze> I var c = $("#canvas");
[06:48:58] <wunderCatze> that's my c var here.
[06:48:58] <danheberden> is getContext a method on a jQuery object wunderCatze?
[06:49:03] <danheberden> (the answer is no)

[06:49:20] <Kambfhase> ?ask @ Wyn
[06:49:20] <wunderCatze> I taught jquery is still javascript
[06:49:20] <danheberden> you want to work with the actual canvas
[06:49:21] <bot-t> Wyn, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:49:27] <anli> Can chrome be setup so it puts information in the F12 panel even if its not open?
[06:49:28] <danheberden> not the jQuery object that holds that dom element
[06:49:29] <Hemebond> Is there a standardised way to initialise new DOM nodes the way $(document).ready() usually does?
[06:50:05] <Kambfhase> What do you mean by "initialise a DOm Node"?
[06:50:19] <wunderCatze> but you guys you were saying jquery it's still javascript and you can use javascript further :D
[06:50:21] <danheberden> wunderCatze: it is, the jQuery object $() creates is a new object that holds references to whatever dom nodes you selected/put-there
[06:50:25] <faraway> docmur: first your elements need to have name attribute, second the element you call serialize on should be a form
[06:50:42] <Hemebond> Well, if you add a new DOM node after the document has initialised all the plugins, how do you get the plugins initialised on the new nodes?
[06:50:50] <danheberden> wunderCatze: so get the raw dom node out of that jQ object
[06:50:54] <danheberden> and then call that native method
[06:51:03] <docmur> it shouldn't matter if I call it on a form or a div, I've serialized div's before
[06:51:08] <Hemebond> For example, a plugin that changes a SELECT element to do something fancy.
[06:51:16] <danheberden> wunderCatze: you'll also see that as $('#idOfYourCanvas')[0]
[06:51:37] <danheberden> which is to get the 1st item in the array of dom nodes on the jQuery object created by $('#idOfYourCanvas')
[06:51:55] <Wyn> I have this set to where the large banner opens, but I want it to automatically toggle to the small banner after 5 or so seconds.  Anyone have any ideas? http://jsfiddle.net/ghHAu/
[06:51:56] <Kambfhase> Hemebond: in that case you might want to try to call that plugin with your new select like jQuery.fancySelect($("newSelect"))
[06:51:59] <danheberden> get(0) does just that and is a bit more declarative/jquery-ish/whatever
[06:52:01] <Kambfhase> just guessing, though
[06:52:14] <wunderCatze> aha
[06:52:24] <wunderCatze> so actually I had to specify [0]
[06:52:29] <wunderCatze> it works now
[06:52:41] <Hemebond> Kambfhase: Any standard way to do it without having to call the plugins on the new nodes?
[06:52:50] <mystblade9> Hi. I'm trying to animate an image using jQueryUI's show() function, with the animation "bounce". The image is centered in CSS using text-align: center; . But, the animation is on the left side of the page while it's animating and then jumps to the center at the end. Any ideas on how to fix this?
[06:53:24] <Kambfhase> Hemebond: unfortunately that depends on the plugin. document.ready is an event fired by the browser.
[06:53:44] <Kambfhase> Hemebond: there is an event for when the DOM changes, but not all plugins listen for that
[06:53:59] <Hemebond> Kambfhase: I see.
[06:54:10] <Wyn> Anyone?
[06:54:57] <Kambfhase> Wyn can you fix your fiddle to have some images?

[07:02:54] <Wyn> That should have images...
[07:03:18] <Hemebond> Does anyone create a new function that accepts a new node and initialises various plugins in the scope of the new node?
[07:03:39] <Kambfhase> Wyn remove the <script> and </script> from the javascript panel and things start to look good :)
[07:04:12] <Kambfhase> Wyn: so, what was you problem again?
[07:04:49] <Wyn> Well I need to have the banner start open to the full size, and after a few seconds toggle to the smaller banner.
[07:04:59] <Wyn> Right now it is just set to click toggle
[07:05:01] <danheberden> Hemebond: that seems a bit counter-productive
[07:05:36] <Hemebond> danheberden: Why is that? Is there a good way to run plugins on new nodes without having to manually call them all?
[07:05:50] <danheberden> like all new nodes?
[07:06:04] <danheberden> i don't think i was understanding what you wanted/were saying
[07:06:14] <danheberden> "initializes" meaning calls for you
[07:06:21] <danheberden> not, like, installs/creates the actual plugin
[07:06:40] <Hemebond> danheberden: Yeah. If you have a plugin that changes the way a SELECT element works, it won't be initialised on SELECT elements added after the document is first "ready"/
[07:06:57] <danheberden> oh, gotcha
[07:07:02] <Kambfhase> Wyn: so you wanto to start with "the horse" and after x seconds that should shring and be replaced by the "trust"?
[07:07:03] <danheberden> does this have to be ie8 and lower?
[07:07:06] <danheberden> Hemebond: ?
[07:07:06] <Hemebond> So I'm trying to figure out a nice way to handle that.
[07:07:26] <Hemebond> danheberden: Uh, I suppose it'd be nice, but I won't be testing on IE8.
[07:07:27] <Wyn> Exactly
[07:07:53] <Hemebond> danheberden: Curious to know how others handle this kind of thing.
[07:08:00] <Kambfhase> ok, let me see. ...
[07:08:07] <danheberden> Hemebond: i use the 'DOMNodeInserted' event
[07:08:11] <danheberden> ?mdc domnodeinserted
[07:08:18] <bot-t> danheberden, DOM event reference | Document Object Model (DOM) | MDN - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/DOM_event_reference
[07:08:32] <danheberden> honestly, though, the best way is to call that plugin on newly added selects
[07:08:41] <wunderCatze> I am having a div and I am trying to put a canvas with drawings AS BACKGROUND to that div. The problem is that if a specify a lower z-index than that div I have no drawings in the back and if I specify a higher z-index than that div canvas will show up, but freeze the links and buttons on the div. Any solutions?
[07:08:44] <danheberden> so if you render a template, check for selects and instantiate them
[07:08:53] <Hemebond> danheberden: But what if you don't/can't know what plugins are being run on the page?
[07:09:20] <Hemebond> That's why I was thinking of having a function that held the various calls to plugins.
[07:09:32] <Hemebond> It could also be called by $(document).ready()

[07:16:08] <Kambfhase> well, setTimeouf( fn, 1000) will execute the function called fn after 1000ms.
[07:17:56] <Kambfhase> TheBrayn: why dont you just replace that tr with another tr and stor the old element?
[07:18:08] <Wyn> Okay.  So if I use setTimeout(function() { //my js//},1000*5);...

[08:26:05] <NavySeal> let me try
[08:26:13] <stewbydoo> I'm pretty sure both work
[08:26:14] <Kambfhase> but you mgiht want $('#test').length > 0
[08:26:26] <Kambfhase> i am pretty sure .html() fucks up
[08:26:38] <stewbydoo> how?
[08:26:47] <Kambfhase> one space and you are screwed
[08:27:02] <stewbydoo> I guess
[08:27:04] <Kambfhase> plus, you forgot a = ;)
[08:27:18] <stewbydoo> true lol
[08:27:21] <Kambfhase> ^^
[08:27:49] <stewbydoo> http://jsfiddle.net/stewbydoo/7ytHM/31/
[08:28:03] <stewbydoo> someone take a look por favor
[08:28:16] <stewbydoo> Idk why it's not letting me access the img's source
[08:28:21] <stewbydoo> it says undefined
[08:28:41] <NavySeal> thank god seems :empty works
[08:28:53] <stewbydoo> gooooooooooooooood
[08:28:55] <NavySeal> ive been trying so many tricks checking content llenght finding if the div exists
[08:28:58] <Kambfhase> stewbydoo: .find() looks down the tree. you need .next()
[08:29:05] <NavySeal> thank you
[08:30:07] <Kambfhase> $("input[name=testing]:checked").next("label").find("img"); works
[08:30:19] <Yokobr> Kambfhase, nope, it's not oppening my page, just the code
[08:30:31] <NavySeal> im starting to like jquery
[08:30:35] <NavySeal> more than xpath
[08:30:36] <stewbydoo> hmm I thought .find would of worked on its own seeing as how it goes down the tree
[08:30:47] <Kambfhase> Yokobr: well, you have to injext you code into the dom then.
[08:30:50] <stewbydoo> so shouldn't it just return the first image element it comes across down the tree?
[08:31:38] <Yokobr> Kambfhase, http://postimage.org/image/5p02fasr9/f6d1c250/
[08:31:51] <Kambfhase> .find() only looks down, ie. for children and then childs of childs etc. but you img is within a label which is NOT a child of the input
[08:32:18] <stewbydoo> ohhhh
[08:32:22] <stewbydoo> thanks for clearing that up
[08:32:26] <Kambfhase> np
[08:32:48] <Kambfhase> Yokobr: yeah, alert() jst displays text. Do you want to create a PopUp?
[08:33:05] <sypris> Hey guys, I'm making a dynamic select dropdown but am unable to click inside the when it's loaded.  Is there anyway to make the .click work only when I click the arrow?  http://pastebin.com/pcNxE1c9
[08:33:09] <hlve> no.
[08:33:33] <Yokobr> Kambfhase, can it be on self?
[08:33:49] <Kambfhase> what?
[08:34:13] <walidvb> hi guys! i'm trying to find the best loading strategy for a page that contains a lot of big images, but you need only view one at a time. it's basically a huge nested slideshow. example here: http://vbbros.net/dietz/works/project
[08:35:09] <walidvb> for the moment I load each adjacent picture as soon as I navigate to one. But I don't feel like navigation is that fluid? problem might be that when you nav up/down, you load the pic on the right even though you might not need to..
[08:35:15] <Yokobr> Kambfhase, the "search.php" within' the vars i've sent on $.post
[08:35:24] <walidvb> anyone feel like picking his brain a little?
[08:35:25] <sypris> walidvb: there are a lot of already made slideshow modules out there. why not use those?
[08:35:47] <walidvb> sypris: i use cycle2
[08:36:27] <Kambfhase> Yokobr: you can replace the entire page with the code you just loaded. But that makes the ajax kinda useless.
[08:37:05] <Yokobr> Kambfhase, well, it worth a try :)
[08:37:17] <Kambfhase> good luck with that.
[08:38:05] <walidvb> sypris: but i still need to fiddle with it to have something usable
[08:38:10] <sypris> walidvb: you could load 5 pics at a time..and when you get to pic 3 or 4 you could load another set of pics
[08:38:46] <Kambfhase> LOAD ALL THE PICS!
[08:40:50] <sypris> load a set amount and before getting to the end of that, load some more.  That way you aren't dropping loads everywhere :)
[08:40:59] <sypris> see what I did there?
[08:41:02] <sypris> dropping loads
[08:41:31] <sypris> someone fix my issue
[08:41:51] <walidvb> sypris: ?
[08:41:58] <walidvb> Kambfhase: i can't do that..
[08:42:27] <Kambfhase> :(
[08:42:30] <walidvb> sypris: well, what do you think is the best strategy? thing is, i really cannot know what the next 5 pictures are going to be visited
[08:42:50] <Wyn> I tried using window.setTimeout to change a variable value to 1 after a few seconds, but it's not working.
[08:45:19] <sypris> walidvb: I didn't mess with your site that much...thought it was just a linear slideshow
[08:45:39] <walidvb> sypris it's up/down/left/right keyboard supported
[08:47:12] <Kambfhase> walidvb: random tip: if you were using opting your png sizes could be decreased by like 20%
[08:48:12] <sypris> walidvb: is this a grid system?
[08:49:01] <walidvb> Kambfhase: true that, these are dummy images i put there for dev'ing
[08:49:07] <walidvb> sypris: what do you mean?
[08:49:10] <Kambfhase> kk
[08:49:16] <walidvb> it's a nested malsup's cycle2
[08:49:32] <walidvb> Kambfhase: and it's also true that what i have in place would work just fine with pngs
[08:51:15] <sypris> I've never messed with cycle2
[08:51:19] <sypris> but it seems kind of dumb
[08:51:24] <sypris> if you go right 3 times
[08:51:38] <sypris> then up..it's the same thing as going up from the start
[08:52:03] <sypris> so it's not a grid based system
[08:52:36] <Milos> How do I do something like
[08:52:43] <Milos> $(this).show(function() { })
[08:52:48] <Milos> i.e. I want to skip the speed and use the callback
[08:52:51] <Milos> but that doesn't work
[08:52:57] <Milos> as it's missing the required parameter, speed
[08:53:06] <Milos> I tried $(this).show(callback = function() { ... });
[08:53:08] <Milos> but that didn't work either
[08:53:08] <sypris> speed and callback don't have to be used
[08:53:14] <Milos> yes but I want to use callback
[08:53:19] <Milos> and it won't let me without specifying speed
[08:53:24] <Milos> so how do I skip that
[08:53:39] <sypris> $("#Identifier").show();
[08:53:47] <Milos> hello
[08:53:51] <Milos> I said I need to use a callback
[08:53:56] <Milos> like 3 times
[08:54:14] <sypris> my bad, didn't see that part
[08:54:17] <Milos> :)
[08:54:18] <pachet> just use animate
[08:54:19] <pachet> instead
[08:54:23] <Milos> hmm ok
[08:54:42] <pachet> $('#foo').animate({ opacity : 1}, callback) or whatever
[08:54:46] <Milos> ah cool
[08:54:54] <Milos> but generally does anyone know how to skip params, or should I ask ##javascript
[08:54:57] <Kambfhase> why not use the standard speed?
[08:55:06] <Milos> Kambfhase, -_-
[08:55:09] <Milos> because I want to show it immediately
[08:55:09] <silverwind> Milos: You cannot.
[08:55:12] <Milos> end of story
[08:55:17] <Milos> silverwind, wow ok.
[08:55:26] <pachet> Milos: oh, then that's not going to do what you want
[08:55:33] <Kambfhase> $().show(1,function(){}) then
[08:55:34] <silverwind> milos: Then you could use .css('opacity', 1') ?
[08:55:38] <pachet> emitting the speed arg for .animate just uses the default
[08:55:43] <silverwind> Ah.. need the callback\
[08:55:48] <pachet> which i think is 300 ms? cant remember
[08:55:50] <Milos> the opacity won't help me in this case as it will interfere with classes silverwind
[08:55:51] <TheBrayn> http://i.imgur.com/YieWw.png <- some wtf for you :D
[08:56:08] <Milos> pachet, I could just set speed to 0 for .animate, yes?
[08:56:10] <skypce> hello
[08:56:29] <pachet> Milos: sure, but, why don't you just execute the callback immediately :[
[08:56:47] <skypce> how can i load a jquery file when css file was loaded?
[08:56:51] <pachet> the redraw is close enough to being synchronous that it shouldnt matter
[08:56:51] <Milos> pachet, because that screws up the animations as jquery is lovely and does everything asynchronously
[08:56:59] <Milos> it ain't
[08:57:18] <Milos> in some places it's so bad that I have to use .promise()
[08:57:22] <pachet> you're chaining things in the fx queue, you're saying?
[08:57:31] <Milos> correct
[08:57:46] <sypris> $('#Identifier').show(function() {   <--- that doesn't work?
[08:57:47] <Hemebond> danheberden: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/livequery
[08:57:59] <Milos> I need to .show() something in the container, and then slideDown() the parent
[08:58:01] <Hemebond> Looks like what I want.
[08:58:14] <Milos> if I do child.show() and parent.slideDown() simultaneously (as it would do) then it stuffs up
[08:58:16] <Milos> looks like crap
[08:58:22] <Milos> if I do them with a callback it's great
[08:58:27] <Milos> except I'm having some trouble doing that
[08:58:42] <sypris> put in jsfiddle and shoow
[08:59:00] <danheberden> Hemebond: that's event delegation
[08:59:05] <danheberden> you can do *that* with .on
[08:59:20] <danheberden> that's not automatically calling methods on dom elements added
[08:59:29] <danheberden> that's getting bubbled events on document and working with themn
[08:59:33] <Hemebond> Ah, so it is.
[08:59:39] <pachet> Milos: herm, i guess have a look at .queue
[08:59:39] <danheberden> e.g. $( document ).on('click', 'select', fn )
[08:59:50] <Hemebond> Yeah, not what I wanted then.
[08:59:52] <Hemebond> I misread it.
[08:59:55] <pachet> Milos: will let you introduce random functions into the fx queue (or whatever queue you specify)
[08:59:59] <pachet> ?.queue @ Milos
[09:00:01] <bot-t> Milos, .queue([queueName]): Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/queue/
[09:01:08] <walidvb> sypris: sry got disconnected
[09:01:17] <walidvb> it isn't a grid based system, indeed
[09:01:24] <walidvb> it's a nested slideshow system
[09:01:33] <Milos> pachet, thanks I'll take a look.
[09:03:01] <Heather_> I got var var = $('.selec').data('value'); and I want to incremenet it at callback function but I'm getting NaN when displaying it.
[09:03:15] <pachet> var isn't a valid identifier
[09:03:24] <tlkr> Milos: why don't you just use .css('display', 'block'), you don't need to use a callback if it's immediate. The .css() function uses the style attribute on the dom rather than dicking with the class
[09:03:48] <Heather_> pachet do I use int/double?
[09:03:59] <Kambfhase> TheBrayn: that code is weird.
[09:04:01] <Milos> tlkr, I'll check if it interferes with this specific case and use if applicable. Thanks for the tip.
[09:04:07] <pachet> no, i meant you can't declare a variable with the identifier 'var', as you had
[09:04:14] <pachet> Heather_: var foo = x
[09:04:19] <Heather_> I see
[09:04:23] <Heather_> okay
[09:06:06] <walidvb> sypris: back here :)
[09:06:09] <Milos> tlkr, looks like ass still, need callback for some reason.
[09:06:32] <Milos> And putting it into jsfiddle will take more time than just using a callback so I'm going to stick with what I've got.
[09:06:39] <walidvb> what about the one on left? see? that's a bit the issue(maybe i already have the best solution, was just looking for ideas)
[09:06:45] <cusco> what does it mean ' Invalid left-hand side in assignment' ?
[09:07:13] <Kambfhase> cusco: that means you are trying to assing a value to something like a function call.
[09:07:19] <Milos> cusco, x = y
[09:07:21] <cusco> ahh
[09:07:23] <Kambfhase> foo() = "bar" doesnt work
[09:07:24] <cusco> doo
[09:07:33] <Kambfhase> did you forget a = maybe?
[09:07:35] <cusco> im using if a=b, instead of ==
[09:07:47] <Kambfhase> :D
[09:07:48] <NavySeal> so if i want to replace a div content with a form should i use html ?
[09:07:55] <NavySeal> or text
[09:08:04] <Kambfhase> ?replace @ NavySeal
[09:08:05] <bot-t> NavySeal, .replaceWith() - Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[09:08:23] <NavySeal> thanks
[09:08:27] <NavySeal> didnt knew u had a bot :D
[09:08:40] <pachet> Heather_: aside from that, you'd get NaN back if you tried to increment a reference that was undefined
[09:08:53] <pachet> ?eval var foo; ++foo
[09:08:53] <bot-t> pachet: NaN
[09:09:01] <Kambfhase> NavySeal: or you could .epmty() and then append()
[09:09:06] <NavySeal> the thing is im trying to override google search button
[09:09:24] <rgr> I'm in a bit of a mess with regard to handling of \r\n after encoding a textarea contents using JSON.stringify and passing to a php backend where I json_decode but the \r\n are still there.
[09:09:28] <NavySeal> not sure how i will do it
[09:10:07] <NavySeal> all i want to do is run a function on button click
[09:10:32] <NavySeal> but they keep  changing their div
[09:11:15] <NavySeal> the best thing i came up with is replace their <input>
[09:11:30] <rgr> Why are you trying to override google's search button?
[09:12:09] <NavySeal> because i want to hide my own div depending on having search results or not
[09:13:21] <NavySeal> its the only idea i came up with
[09:14:27] <docmur> I waas here earlier with an issue were I couldn't serialize a form, I added names, wrapped everything in a form and its still not working. http://jsfiddle.net/jY74F/2/  Can anyone see why this isn't serializing
[09:14:40] <tlkr> Milos: .css will do it immediately, the processing will not continue until it has completed, I am slightly confused as to why you need a callback, it depends on what element you are performing the show on as to what display type .show defaults to.
[09:15:17] <sypris> Boom! http://pastebin.com/TRA80gHv  Have a dynamic select box...I want to click the contents and submit them, and anytime the dropdown arrow is clicked to .load contents.
[09:15:32] <Milos> this thing is pretty massive, so there's a lot of stuff going on, and for this specific case if I don't use a callback it looks jagged so I'm going to use a callback for now, as I don't have time to find out the root cause of exactly why it looks jagged when I'm not using a callback
[09:15:36] <Milos> @ tk
[09:15:39] <Milos> tlkr,
[09:16:37] <tlkr> the callback will execute at the same time as any following lines of code though, I'm a perfectionist, you go for it :-)
[09:17:29] <Kambfhase> docmur: can you add the missing text object?
[09:17:55] <docmur> I'm not sure why they aren't showing up the .append should place them in the box
[09:17:56] <Milos> tlkr, no it won't, the whole point of a callback is that it will execute after the events have completed, not immediately during the events, as it's asynchronous
[09:18:28] <tlkr> .css is not asynchronous
[09:18:37] <Kambfhase> docmur: you are doing it wrong.
[09:18:42] <Milos> then I have no idea, tlkr
[09:18:49] <Milos> I will debug it later and let you know
[09:18:57] <tlkr> What dom element are you trying to show Milos?
[09:19:10] <docmur> Okay, how should I do it then?  They boxes show up on my system
[09:19:13] <Milos> a div, if that's what you mean
[09:19:31] <tlkr> Milos: Yes and Ok not sure then, i'll let you get on
[09:19:39] <Kambfhase> docmur: I#ll code smthn for you
[09:21:04] <pachet> Milos: i will say that outside the wonderful world of jquery, the best way to handle issues in reflow is using requestAnimationFrame
[09:21:38] <Kambfhase> docmur: http://jsfiddle.net/jY74F/5/
[09:21:50] <pachet> eg, you have something that you know will force a reflow, and even though the state of the dom will be updated atomically the layout of the page is going to change visually sometime between instantly and the refresh rate
[09:22:10] <pachet> you can defer later processing via passing a function callback to RAF
[09:22:50] <docmur> why would that work but the way I programmed it not work?  All you did was use a varible then throw that varible into the box, I just wrote to the box directly
[09:24:02] <Milos> pachet, thanks, noted :)
[09:24:55] <sypris> boom! .mousedown!
[09:25:04] <Kambfhase> docmur: well, difference is that append() appends Nodes, not HTML-Code.
[09:25:38] <Kambfhase> so the moment you append <form> that will be transferenc into a node - without any children.
[09:25:58] <Kambfhase> the following .appends() will append your elements to the div, not the form
[09:26:25] <docmur> Oh
[09:28:34] <wunderCatze> I am having a div and I am trying to put a canvas with drawings AS BACKGROUND to that div. The problem is that if a specify a lower z-index than that div I have no drawings in the back and if I specify a higher z-index than that div canvas will show up, but freeze the links and buttons on the div. Any solutions?
[09:29:01] <sypris> this is jquery not css :(
[09:29:40] <wunderCatze> actually, canvas is javascript
[09:30:06] <sypris> this is jquery not javascript :(
[09:30:16] <wunderCatze> :)
[09:30:21] <sypris> haha what now?!
[09:30:38] <wunderCatze> you win, congrats
[09:30:43] <sypris> post code dood
[09:30:48] <wunderCatze> I am retiring
[09:30:54] <wunderCatze> code is too much and too complex
[09:31:01] <wunderCatze> I have explain in general
[09:31:23] <wunderCatze> I need an algorithm or a design pattern, not really code correction
[09:32:44] <ujjain> http://pastebin.visilang.com/view/raw/63227e3d - What can explain the little jquery not working? I use the same code on another site
[09:32:44] <sypris> so higher z-index means it's sitting on top right?
[09:32:50] <walidvb> wunderCatze: what do you want?
[09:33:36] <wunderCatze> @walidvb I want a dynamic background for a game menu
[09:33:42] <ujjain> oh, jquery might not be loaded lol
[09:34:07] <wunderCatze> I want to acomplish this with the canvas; however, the actual screens are DIVs
[09:34:08] <Kambfhase> docmur: this code is even nicer: http://jsfiddle.net/jY74F/6/
[09:34:48] <walidvb> wunderCatze: you got a jsfiddle?
[09:35:03] <walidvb> and is the div you put over the canvas transparent?
[09:35:05] <wunderCatze> whoo... I tried to put a part of it. the code is too complex.
[09:35:21] <wunderCatze> I cant provide fiddle
[09:35:25] <walidvb> hm maybe try to set up just the canvas/div part?
[09:35:35] <walidvb> with random canvas content?
[09:36:04] <wunderCatze> no, the bg of div is not transparent (I didnt do it because it works anyways, but not how I want to)
[09:36:13] <wunderCatze> I will give it a try
[09:36:32] <NavySeal> which ones of these i need to treat as special characters ? .replaceWith('<input type="button" value="New" class="gsc-search-button" title="search">');
[09:36:50] <webdev> laters all
[09:37:05] <pachet> wunderCatze: why can't you just have the canvas in the div? position:absolute;z-index:-1;  and then position:relative on the parent?
[09:38:02] <NavySeal> all i get is '); ">
[09:38:21] <wunderCatze> @pachet: very clever. It works this way, but I am having trouble with... other stuff.
[09:38:52] <pachet> sounds ominous
[09:38:52] <Kambfhase> ?p @ NavySeal
[09:38:54] <bot-t> NavySeal, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:39:40] <wunderCatze> the dynamic canvas is generated by a function. calling it multiple times will cause adding canvas elements to the div; and I cannot find a way to remove them.
[09:39:49] <walidvb> pachet: are you not gonna have a div over that anyways?
[09:39:52] <wunderCatze> the dynamic background*
[09:40:31] <pachet> walidvb: im sure what i see in my head isn't exactly what he means
[09:40:43] <walidvb> wunderCatze: well that has to do with you script, then. why would you call what multiple times?
[09:41:03] <pachet> wunderCatze: instead of generating multiple canvases, why not just clear and redraw the existing canvas?
[09:41:08] <walidvb> pachet: i think he needs to have divs over a canvas, am i getting this right wunderCatze?
[09:41:28] <NavySeal> Kambfhase do i really need it its only a line of code.. im isolated from the rest of the code
[09:41:35] <wunderCatze> yes
[09:41:39] <wunderCatze> ok guys
[09:41:43] <NavySeal> http://fixee.org/paste/ctsacz5/
[09:41:51] <wunderCatze> i'll make a fiddle
[09:42:12] <wunderCatze> remember: I didnt ask code corection, I ask a design pattern, as pachet tried to provide
[09:42:29] <fALSO> Hi - Anyone here uses jQuery.Validation ?
[09:42:37] <wunderCatze> http://jsfiddle.net/jY74F/6/ but is way to big
[09:42:46] <walidvb> wunderCatze: haha
[09:42:56] <wunderCatze> the function generating dynamic bg is called doDots()
[09:43:00] <fALSO> how can i define the min and max on the classes ?
[09:43:11] <walidvb> wunderCatze: hm swrong url?
[09:43:23] <wunderCatze> wait, wrong fiddle
[09:43:33] <wunderCatze> here: http://jsfiddle.net/jY74F/8/
[09:43:56] <wunderCatze> z-indexes are in .screen and #canvas
[09:44:04] <wunderCatze> function is: doDots();
[09:44:54] <wunderCatze> wrapper is the allmighty wrapper: it contains divs (that are screens, the one active is the onlyone visible) and the canvas tag
[09:44:57] <teratorn> hi there are broken links all over the site, e.g. http://api.jqueryui.com/category/effect/ referred by http://api.jqueryui.com/effect/
[09:44:58] <walidvb> ok 1 sex
[09:44:58] <teratorn> just fyi
[09:45:02] <walidvb> erm..
[09:45:03] <walidvb> ;)
[09:45:04] <walidvb> sec
[09:46:37] <NavySeal> i just fix it
[09:46:44] <NavySeal> replaced the " for '
[09:46:49] <wunderCatze> tried creating dynamically canvas on active screen, the problem is that calling doDots() again it will add canvas again and couldnt find a method to clear the canvas elements (tried .remove() )
[09:46:55] <NavySeal> and inside added \" instead "
[09:48:37] <walidvb> hm wunderCatze: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/jY74F/9/
[09:50:19] <wunderCatze> what did you do till now?
[09:50:44] <walidvb> :)
[09:50:54] <walidvb> what do you mean? what did i change?
[09:50:56] <wunderCatze> if you click and enter the "main-menu" screen the bg it doesnt works
[09:50:58] <wunderCatze> yes
[09:51:06] <walidvb> added transparancy to your css
[09:51:15] <walidvb> oh sry didn't check nothing
[09:51:16] <wunderCatze> hmm
[09:51:23] <wunderCatze> only to the splash-screen?
[09:51:29] <wunderCatze> let's try .screen
[09:51:51] <wunderCatze> aaa
[09:51:53] <wunderCatze> i see
[09:52:00] <wunderCatze>     background: rgba(0,0,0,0.5);
[09:53:00] <walidvb> wunderCatze: exactly
[09:54:04] <wunderCatze> I think it's working
[09:54:07] <wunderCatze> lol
[09:54:22] <wunderCatze> I didnt expect a CSS solve, only js
[09:54:40] <walidvb> wunderCatze: well you need to do the same with #menu
[09:55:07] <wunderCatze> it works till now, but I am not so enthuziast. I worked on this problem for 2 days
[09:55:22] <wunderCatze> and no pozitive results till now :)
[09:55:27] <wunderCatze> ty very much, sir!
[09:55:44] <walidvb> haha
[09:56:04] <walidvb> well.. checking your overlapping div's background was a good start :D
[09:56:24] <walidvb> but yw
[09:56:33] <walidvb> send a link to the game once it's finished
[09:57:11] <wunderCatze> yeah, right. call me next year :))
[09:57:31] <wunderCatze> if this was kept me for working for two days... sheesh.
[09:57:46] <wunderCatze> kept me off*
[09:57:50] <walidvb> wunderCatze: and about your functions aboutActive(), why not simply $('.active:not(#about)').removeClass('active')

[09:58:34] <wunderCatze> :D
[09:58:57] <wunderCatze> ty
[09:59:32] <walidvb> jmar777: looks nice
[09:59:40] <walidvb> wunderCatze: is this your first code?
[10:03:19] <wunderCatze> not really...
[10:03:32] <wunderCatze> i did some minor jquery... stuff before
[10:03:42] <walidvb> wunderCatze: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/BGJke/
[10:04:00] <LSshock> Quick little question, i have var that holds a position number (for a list) is there a way to get all elements of a class that are below a number (of result) ?
[10:04:22] <walidvb> wunderCatze: you get the idea?
[10:04:39] <walidvb> try and have modular code, you really are going to die otherwise
[10:04:41] <jmar777> walidvb: thanks
[10:05:24] <wunderCatze> @walidvb I am new acctually
[10:05:27] <wunderCatze> to OOP
[10:05:35] <jmar777> LSshock: as in elements of a class with an index below a certain number?
[10:05:37] <wachpwnski> best js I ever wrote: while(true) {alert('Hello World!');}
[10:05:41] <walidvb> wunderCatze: ok. let me work on ur thing a minute, i'll send you a link
[10:05:47] <walidvb> just so you get an idea
[10:05:50] <walidvb> or ideas
[10:05:57] <wunderCatze> but I got the idea
[10:06:44] <wunderCatze> I can understand 100% the code, but it will take a while till I will write like this
[10:07:17] <silverwind> ?js console.log('lol');
[10:07:20] <bot-t> silverwind: "lol"
[10:07:31] <LSshock> jmar777: yes!
[10:07:51] <wunderCatze> this chat is the second best thing it happend to me, sincerely, you guys rock
[10:08:18] <jmar777> LSshock: you can do something like: $('.some-class:lt(index)')
[10:09:04] <LSshock> :lt? lower than?
[10:10:06] <jmar777> LSshock: less than, basically the same
[10:10:34] <walidvb> wunderCatze: hehe
[10:11:03] <LSshock> ah hehe :) thanks i will give that a try!
[10:11:27] <jmar777> LSshock: note that that isn't really index based though. it simply filters the collection. so if you have multiple containers and you want to sect the first e.g., 3 in each container, that's not going to work
[10:13:04] <LSshock> oh darn
[10:13:43] <LSshock> oh no, it might work, only 1 list start at a pre defined one while others just start at the newest
[10:14:40] <Dr4g> For some reason $.parseJSON() returns NULL when I put this string into it: https://raw.github.com/gist/b9de77fd8654078a4747/96e2ff4a55e6cf328fb5fd22d5c3b46c093ba5ee/gistfile1.json
[10:14:42] <Dr4g> Any reasons why ?
[10:14:50] <Dr4g> Looks like a valid array to me.
[10:16:52] <jmar777> LSshock: if you need to use that index relative to multiple containers, you can also do this (e.g., finding the first 3 list items in multiple lists): â€‹$â€‹('ul').map(function() { return $(this).children('li:lt(3)').get(); });
[10:18:03] <jmar777> LSshock: example: http://jsfiddle.net/CKHNs/
[10:19:18] <walidvb> wunderCatze: hm having some trouble with css animation
[10:19:32] <walidvb> but you want wo stick to that, for performance reasons
[10:19:39] <walidvb> css anim are rendered on GPU
[10:19:49] <walidvb> wunderCatze: anyways: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/BGJke/3/
[10:22:26] <LSshock> thanks jmar777!
[10:22:38] <jmar777> LSshock: np
[10:23:55] <walidvb> wunderCatze: there, fixed: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/BGJke/4/
[10:24:59] <zjk> Is it possible to do : $.fn.myPluginName.myPluginFunction() ?
[10:25:26] <teratorn> does anyone have an example of a slide effect, where you have two div's side-by-side (inline-block I guess), and you want the first div to slide out of the viewport left, and you want the right (currently invisible) div, to follow it and slide in left to replace the position of the first div?
[10:26:30] <walidvb> teratorn: hm what's the issue there?
[10:26:44] <teratorn> walidvb: the issue is that I don't know what the hell I am doing.
[10:26:50] <walidvb> haha
[10:26:53] <walidvb> you have a start?
[10:27:11] <teratorn> not really
[10:27:40] <walidvb> you know css3?
[10:28:04] <teratorn> somewhat
[10:29:14] <walidvb> hm
[10:29:44] <Saaether> theres a plugin ive used for doing stuff like that before, scrollto
[10:29:47] <Saaether> http://flesler.blogspot.ca/2007/10/jqueryscrollto.html
[10:29:58] <walidvb> teratorn:
[10:29:58] <walidvb> http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/GQNqS/
[10:30:35] <teratorn> thanks Ill check it :)
[10:30:38] <walidvb> teratorn: click on the stars
[10:31:00] <walidvb> that can give you ideas. it's really not complicated, and you can get good results easily.
[10:31:33] <walidvb> if you want a more concrete example, i'll point you to www.plak-records.com , entirely CSS(except class removing/adding of course)
[10:31:57] <walidvb> and i did smth quite similar to what you want, i believe
[10:33:36] <teratorn> walidvb: you made a website that loads 13 megabytes to display an animated gif?
[10:33:55] <walidvb> teratorn: sry?
[10:33:55] <teratorn> walidvb: oh sorry, my mistake
[10:34:08] <walidvb> no animated gifs on my site
[10:34:10] <teratorn> walidvb: my browser did load 13 MB off the page though
[10:34:19] <teratorn> walidvb: just the "loading" one
[10:34:39] <walidvb> true, this one, right.
[10:34:45] <walidvb> teratorn: hm lemme check
[10:36:53] <walidvb> how do you check that?
[10:38:09] <Criztian> guys I just started working with jquery and my question is the following: I set up two buttons, only one has an id. When I do $("button:not(id)").click() it doesn't leave out that button
[10:38:21] <walidvb> teratorn: hm i don't know which site you talk about, or how to check that
[10:38:35] <walidvb> Criztian: :not(#id)
[10:38:56] <green-> i'm attempting to use jquery UI's slide effect to slide a div out of the window â€¦ the div in question has it's position attribute set to fixed, but jquery ui is sliding it relative to it's containing element, not the window â€¦ is this expected?
[10:39:57] <Criztian> walidvb: hmm it still doesn't leave it out
[10:40:23] <walidvb> Criztian: hm i don't know. put it up on jsfiddle i guess
[10:41:17] <suncica2222> 	how does this work?
[10:41:18] <suncica2222> 	http://offliberty.com/
[10:41:18] <suncica2222> 	this is not applet
[10:41:18] <suncica2222> 	wtf is this?
[10:42:37] <BillCriswell> suncica2222: No idea.
[10:43:00] <walidvb> suncica2222: probably has some python/ruby or smth running in the background
[10:43:03] <walidvb> no?
[10:43:15] <BillCriswell> I just have no idea what it's supposed to do.
[10:43:32] <walidvb> BillCriswell: it looks like it rips audio/video, no?
[10:43:48] <walidvb> but i tried it on my site and all it found was a swf player
[10:43:51] <suncica2222> yes
[10:44:12] <BillCriswell> walidvb: http://offliberty.com/#about just found this.
[10:44:17] <suncica2222> but wtf? form is empty? you think its server side?
[10:44:22] <walidvb> lol same here
[10:44:29] <walidvb> suncica2222: most likely
[10:44:56] <BillCriswell> I guess it's like... advanced caching? No idea.
[10:46:03] <walidvb> wunderCatze: you're all good?
[10:46:06] <walidvb> i'm off
[10:46:09] <mouses> $.each(myArray, function(index, value){  $("<img />", { src: /* some code */ }) });      ... i want to set the src to the current array's myURL.  if i say $(this).myURL, would that refer to the "this" of myArray or the "this" of the <img>?
[10:46:11] <walidvb> in 8%
[10:46:13] <walidvb> :D
[10:46:30] <Heather_> What function should I look into if I want to check some e.g PHP values when the page loads. Need these values to create conditions in my js files and bind/unbind events.
[10:47:03] <MistuhKurtz> mouses, write your code on jsfiddle.net and I"ll fix it for you
[10:47:27] <BillCriswell> mouses: Not sure I'm following properly.
[10:47:52] <BillCriswell> Heather_: You want to read the get variables in the url string?
[10:47:55] <Criztian> walidvb: http://jsfiddle.net/7U2Wn/1/
[10:48:01] <mouses> ok hold on
[10:48:23] <walidvb> Criztian: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/7U2Wn/2/
[10:49:16] <Heather_> no I want to assign variables from server side to certain dom element objects and depending on these values assign events where needed.
[10:49:24] <wunderCatze> yes, walidvb, that code is great!
[10:49:35] <wunderCatze> ty very much
[10:49:50] <walidvb> wunderCatze: that's a bit the idea
[10:49:51] <green-> from what I can tell jquery effects is determining how to slide an element based on markup, not css. perhaps this is normal?
[10:49:59] <suncica2222> walidvb: doing this server-side takes terabytes, and applet uses 10MB per month, I don't think it's server side
[10:50:02] <walidvb> and do check html5's css3 propertys
[10:50:11] <suncica2222> bandwith
[10:50:20] <BillCriswell> You just want to include different code based on variables in PHP?
[10:50:24] <walidvb> suncica2222: hm. true
[10:50:56] <Criztian> walidvb: I know that solution but I needed to know how to tell it to avoid all buttons with an id (they will all be different)
[10:51:05] <walidvb> oh
[10:51:09] <BillCriswell> Heather_: <?php if($isAdmin): ?><script src="admin.js"></script><?php endif ?> like this?
[10:51:59] <Criztian> walidvb: I thought that entering id would have done it but it doesn't
[10:52:11] <walidvb> Criztian: http://jsfiddle.net/walidvb/7U2Wn/3/
[10:52:31] <Heather_> not entire script but rather conditions inside the js. E.g assign events to dom objects depending on some value from server side
[10:52:37] <Criztian> walidvb: oooooooh perfect thanks
[10:52:40] <walidvb> or you could give your buttons a class
[10:52:44] <walidvb> which i would do
[10:53:15] <Heather_> so I figured I need to carry those server side values to js files and create necessary conditions there
[10:53:50] <Criztian> walidvb: yeah .classname but since I'm learning jquery just now I figured I might need to know how to reference it that way, now I do XD
[10:54:08] <walidvb> hm
[10:54:14] <walidvb> sure, now you know
[10:54:23] <BillCriswell> Heather_: You can have php parse your javascript files before it's sent to the browser.
[10:55:34] <Heather_> hmm okay i'll look into it thanks
[10:56:21] <mouses> nevermind, my question was stupid
[10:56:46] <mouses> the each function gave me the reference to the array alreadu
[10:57:23] <BillCriswell> Heather_: You can do <script src="scripts.php"></script>, just make sure you set the right headers, like header(Content-Type: text/javascript);
[10:57:43] <walidvb> mouses: it really wasn't, i had the exact same question 2 days ago
[10:58:05] <BillCriswell> header('Content-Type: text/javascript'); I meant.
[10:58:10] <walidvb> and not sure i got the answer. but basically 'this' context isn't always passed to the following fn
[10:58:19] <lmat> so https://github.com/Khan/khan-exercises/blob/master/jquery.js is the jquery library?
[10:58:37] <BillCriswell> lmat: That's it.
[10:58:49] <MistuhKurtz> mouses, "this" always refers to the object that the function is a method of
[10:58:49] <BillCriswell> 9,000 lines of awesome.
[10:58:57] <lmat> BillCriswell: :) Thanks
[10:59:07] <MistuhKurtz> so when you bind a function to an event, the object that owns that function is the DOM element it's bound to
[10:59:14] <MistuhKurtz> and that's what "this" refers to
[10:59:56] <hlve> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/5CJYX/ How come when I'm typing in my first text box, it's doesn't update the value in the second box 100%? It seems to drop the last letter typed..
[11:00:03] <mouses> ok thanks
[11:00:09] <MistuhKurtz> I'm not exactly sure what 'this' refers to in the case of using each to iterate over an array, but I'm inclined to think it's the whole array
[11:00:44] <hlve> Ah
[11:00:46] <hlve> should be using keyup.
[11:00:46] <hlve> ;P
[11:00:50] <mouses> still havent checked my code yet but i will when i'm ready to test
[11:10:10] <green-> bah, i thought jquery UI 1.9.0 would solve this issue of position:fixed elements sliding relative to their containing element (and not the browser window), but no such luck.
[11:10:13] <stewbydoo> i'm trying to iterate over radio buttons and change their values using the .each function and am having trouble accesing each one uniquely  http://jsfiddle.net/stewbydoo/7ytHM/39/
[11:11:03] <widoz> hi, i'd created this form http://jsfiddle.net/LMaS3/ for validate i place the errors into the value attribute for input and textarea, and i need to know if the error messages are a specific text, instead to use a simple comparison to a string there is a way to get all of the error messages which are in relation to a field?
[11:12:15] <BillCriswell> stewbydoo: Seems to be working here.
[11:12:41] <stewbydoo> did you use my fiddle?
[11:13:29] <BillCriswell> stewbydoo: Yes.
[11:13:38] <BillCriswell> 1, one, 2, one are the alerts.
[11:13:56] <stewbydoo> oh wrong link
[11:14:08] <stewbydoo> http://jsfiddle.net/stewbydoo/7ytHM/40/
[11:14:27] <stewbydoo> I want to take the colors array and have red inserted in the first one and blue in the second one
[11:14:52] <BillCriswell> stewbydoo: You want ['red', 'blue'] not {'red', 'blue'}
[11:15:45] <green-> and why does the slide effect hide the element by default? it doesn't say anything about hiding, but evidently it is.
[11:16:00] <stewbydoo> got it thanks
[11:16:39] <BillCriswell> stewbydoo: Welcome.

[11:56:24] <drale2k> does anyone know if jquery will switch to css3 transitions for $.animate ? ?
[11:57:40] <johnkpaul> drale2k: no, not automatically
[11:57:42] <johnkpaul> look into jquery transite
[11:57:44] <johnkpaul> transit
[11:57:51] <johnkpaul> ?g jquery transit @ drale2k
[11:57:53] <bot-t> drale2k, jQuery Transit - CSS3 animations for jQuery - http://ricostacruz.com/jquery.transit/
[11:58:05] <drale2k> johnkpaul: i had issues with that
[11:58:20] <drale2k> i reported them on github and because of that i can't use it
[11:59:08] <drale2k> is there a reason why jQuery won't switch? all browsers support it
[12:01:32] <johnkpaul> drale2k: all browser support css3 transitions?
[12:02:14] <drale2k> except IE
[12:02:33] <drale2k> but with the next release they are dropping support for IE8 or?
[12:03:28] <TelFiRE> drale2k: 1.9 will be maintained and have feature parity with 2.0 until Ie8 is no longer relevant
[12:03:55] <TelFiRE> 2.0 will just be more lightweight and perhaps support some extra features
[12:04:18] <drale2k> will it support css3 transitions, do you know?
[12:04:50] <TelFiRE> it won't do anything extra for ie
[12:05:06] <TelFiRE> so if you have some other hack that enables the transitions to work in ie, it might. but by and large, I suspect not.
[12:05:55] <mouses> http://jsfiddle.net/3mSUR/ ==  how come these elements are not nested? they are all appearing one after the other.
[12:10:51] <mouses> #list is already in the DOM and <li> is properly nested into it. everything following <li> is NOT nested
[12:10:51] <drale2k> well it could fallback to how it works right now for IE
[12:10:51] <TelFiRE> That's what 1.9 is for
[12:10:51] <TelFiRE> 2.0 basically cuts the library's size and execution time in half by removing IE-related checks and code
[12:10:51] <TelFiRE> and that's the only major difference
[12:10:51] <TelFiRE> So if you are after IE support, 1.9 is perfect for what you want
[12:10:51] <TelFiRE> or, will be
[12:10:51] <drale2k> but it still hurts every browser except IE because of IE
[12:10:51] <drale2k> with not using css3 transition, especially mobile browsers
[12:10:51] <TelFiRE> Yes, because there is no technological way around that
[12:10:51] <TelFiRE> That's the whole point of 2.0
[12:10:52] <TelFiRE> Remove all the extra crap that is necesarry to be there in order to support IE
[12:10:52] <TelFiRE> Though I know nothing of the actual JS behind jQuery, those who do say it's basically impossible to shave off that extra stuff without sacrificing IE support, and that adding it back in would bring it right back to where it was. So there's really no other solution than to provide 1.9 (which will be up to date and not considered "old" or unusable) if you NEED IE support and if you don't, you can use 2.0. But only if you don't need ie support
[12:11:17] <drale2k> TelFiRE: but that's the point, i don't need IE support and therefor i want to use css3 transitions for smoothness
[12:11:18] <mouses> any help bros?
[12:11:25] <ravenzz> choose jquery as framework
[12:11:33] <ravenzz> to begin with
[12:11:40] <TelFiRE> drale2k css3 transitions work fine in everywhere but IE so I don't know what you're saying
[12:11:55] <mouses> http://jsfiddle.net/3mSUR/ ==  how come these elements after <li> are not nested? they are all appearing one after the other.
[12:12:15] <mouses> i want all of them to be inserted within eachother
[12:12:25] <drale2k> TelFiRE: i talking about jQuery switchting to css3 for $.fn.animate  with 2.0
[12:12:25] <excalibur1976DE> hi
[12:12:37] <excalibur1976DE> /exit
[12:12:39] <hlve> mouses: copy all of your HTML/css over...
[12:12:39] <TelFiRE> drale2k: yes?
[12:12:39] <TelFiRE> '
[12:12:52] <mouses> its complicated, php
[12:13:02] <hlve> it's a CSS issue you're having.
[12:13:05] <hlve> sooooooo yeah
[12:13:07] <drale2k> TelFiRE: and you are telling me 2.0 is about not supporting IE but it will not use css3 for $.fn.animate because of IE
[12:13:28] <TelFiRE> I mean I don't understand what your issue is. CSS3 animation obviously is not supported in IE. They moved to it in 2.0 because it's supported everywhere else and the whole point of 2.0 is to drop ie support in order to make the framework lighter and performance better, which CSS3 animation accomplishes.
[12:13:31] <bobson__> What's the best way to find out if a div is a child (3 levels down) of one class or another?  ie: <div id='tea'> <div> <div> div class='a'> </div></div></div>   -  is .a a descendant of #tea or #apple?
[12:13:48] <TelFiRE> drale2k: No I have no idea where you got that idea.
[12:13:51] <mouses> chrome's  dom inspector shows that the elements are not nested. i dont think thats a CSS issue
[12:13:56] <drale2k> TelFiRE: lol ?
[12:13:57] <mouses> its the way i'm calling the functions
[12:13:59] <drale2k> am i drunk? :D
[12:14:01] <drale2k> or you
[12:14:10] <drale2k> so 2.0 will use css3 transitions ?
[12:14:17] <ravenzz> drale2k ie9 still doesn't support css3
[12:14:18] <ravenzz> animations
[12:14:24] <TelFiRE> I never even hinted at the idea that it wouldn't use CSS3 because of IE.... you asked if it would "support css3" and that makes no sense at all. I assumed you meant, can you use 2.0 with its CSS3 and have IE support, to which the answer is no
[12:14:25] <ravenzz> same for transitions
[12:15:07] <drale2k> TelFiRE: no my initial question was if jQuery is going to use css3 tranistion for $.fn.animate
[12:15:39] <TelFiRE> Oh ok. Well, what ravenzz said... jQuery CAN do CSS3 if you tell it to, but it has its own animation engine for IE9. IE9 support is not being dropped and doesn't need to in order to make the library significantly lighter
[12:16:05] <mouses> my issue has nothing to do with css
[12:16:07] <TelFiRE> I guess I missed the start of it, my bad
[12:16:15] <mouses> the DOM is not showing the elements nested
[12:16:26] <drale2k> TelFiRE: Is that starting with 2.0 or even earlier ?
[12:16:30] <mouses> only the first <li> is nested into the top element
[12:16:31] <ravenzz> drale2k the answer is: we don't know :d
[12:16:41] <ravenzz> ask some jquery developer
[12:16:57] <TelFiRE> drale2k: is what starting with 2.0?
[12:17:15] <TelFiRE> drale2k: CSS3 animation is an OPTION. jQuery animates without it by default, and always has.
[12:18:44] <bobson__> Can anyone help me solve this little traversal problem please? http://jsfiddle.net/PzSHN/
[12:18:55] <TelFiRE> mouses: you might have more luck if your jsfiddle actually functioned at all
[12:19:03] <mouses> lol
[12:19:17] <drale2k> TelFiRE: the last time i checked it was not even an options, just wondering
[12:19:57] <TelFiRE> drale2k: well it's not an "option" per se, but if you change the css properties on an object that has a transition: property, it will work
[12:20:27] <TelFiRE> bobson__: not sure what the problem is?
[12:20:53] <bobson__> My problem is in the JS
[12:21:06] <bobson__> I need to know if my class on click is achild of #tea or #soup
[12:21:20] <TelFiRE> bobson__: oh you want to know how to check
[12:21:28] <bobson__> yes
[12:23:25] <lampe2> hey is there a way to use the resizeable feature from jwuery ui on mobile devices ?
[12:23:55] <TelFiRE> bobson__: http://jsfiddle.net/PzSHN/1/
[12:23:58] <drale2k> TelFiRE: ah ok thanks
[12:24:13] <mouses> ok bro it functions
[12:24:19] <mouses> http://jsfiddle.net/3mSUR/1/
[12:24:49] <bobson__> TelFiRE: That's not sustainable if the level is dynamic
[12:25:09] <Guest9716> If I have a button in a table cell, that has a jquery click.  $(this).parent()  == the TD correct?
[12:25:23] <mouses> if you inspect the dom, you can see that the result does not have the elements nested after <li>.  i want <li><a><img /><div><p /><p /></div></a></li>
[12:25:37] <TelFiRE> bobson__: how are you going to know how many levels up it is, what is unique about its top level container? you might need to give a class to identify that.
[12:25:53] <mouses> TelFiRE: it functions
[12:26:01] <bobson__> TelFiRE: There is only two possible parents: #tea or #soup
[12:26:08] <bobson__> or ancestors rather
[12:26:33] <bobson__> I just need to figure out which one the click happened in
[12:26:49] <NoiseEee> mouses: append the things you want in <a> to the <a>, then append THAT to your li
[12:27:38] <NoiseEee> also, having it in one unreadable line gets you 0 bonus points
[12:27:39] <mouses> shouldnt my current syntax do that?
[12:27:48] <mouses> lol
[12:28:04] <ravenzz> bobsapp $(this).closest('#tea').length
[12:28:23] <ravenzz> if length > 0 it is a descendant of tea
[12:28:40] <ravenzz> or a descendant of soup otherwise
[12:29:03] <bobson__> thanks closest is what i needed.  thought it worked downwards :P
[12:30:01] <mouses> NoiseEee: am i misunderstanding append()? shouldnt i be able to keep calling append like that and each element will be nested?
[12:30:46] <TelFiRE> I think part of your problem is that you can't append inside an img because there's no closing tag
[12:30:56] <TelFiRE> but idk, I don't know how append works tbh
[12:31:15] <tw2113> probably locates the last child and adds whatever right after
[12:32:03] <mouses> yeah the img appending makes no sense, my bad
[12:32:17] <mouses> and the p inside the p
[12:32:26] <mouses> let me rework it
[12:34:40] <mouses> i used to be a software engineer, years ago. i hated doing this for a company. much more free to do it on my own personal projects
[12:35:06] <mouses> i've spent hours coding my eyes out. i would hate to have the pressure of a manager asking when this shit will be done
[12:39:19] <bowenac_> is it possible to loop a script?
[12:39:30] <bowenac_> curious if someone could look at this http://jsfiddle.net/4Vvr2/1/
[12:39:52] <bowenac_> just adding a class to a clicked link, and clearing class on other links
[12:40:14] <bowenac_> but it only works if you click first link, then second link, if you click second link, then first link they both stay active
[12:44:27] <xec> bowenac_: i'm not sure what exactly you're asking, but you can only use any given ID once in a html document
[12:44:41] <wachpwnski> anyone know a good way to turn text into a textbox on click and have it flow properly?
[12:45:21] <xec> ?mdc contenteditable @ wachpwnski
[12:45:24] <bot-t> wachpwnski, Content Editable | HTML | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Content_Editable
[12:46:07] <bowenac_> ahh so I should wrap them all in an id
[12:46:11] <xec> wachpwnski: you could just enable that on click
[12:46:27] <xec> bowenac_: i'm not sure what you're trying to do - how is it supposed to behave?
[12:46:32] <wachpwnski> That is html5 only though right?
[12:46:46] <xec> wachpwnski: supported in all browsers pretty much iirc
[12:47:09] <xec> check out the compatibility list
[12:47:09] <Saaether> bowenac: you mean like this? http://jsfiddle.net/4Vvr2/2/
[12:47:28] <bowenac_> when a link is clicked I want to assign an active class to it for css styling, when a different link is clicked I want to remove the class from previous clicked link and assign the class to the newly clicked link
[12:48:13] <bowenac_> Yup
[12:48:15] <bowenac_> that did it
[12:48:18] <bowenac_> thought I did that already
[12:48:24] <bowenac_> thanks
[13:03:12] <scar> is there a way to fadeout the .html('') function?
[13:03:20] <scar> so... fade the html being cleared?
[13:03:42] <scar> or just fade it out clear then fade in?
[13:04:45] <NoiseEee> scar: you fade elements, not raw text
[13:05:05] <tlkr> scar, you could wrap the inner content in a transparent div and fade the div. That would have the same effect
[13:05:06] <NoiseEee> scar: so either wrap that in a tag and fade that, or similar
[13:05:32] <LSshock> scar: $("holder").fadeOut().html('').fadeIn();
[13:05:43] <LSshock> *holder > #holder (or any other element)
[13:08:07] <hlve> what's the bootstrap channel?
[13:08:08] <hlve> anyone?
[13:09:59] <hlve> nvm. got it.
[13:19:21] <mouses> finally fixed that nesting issue
[13:26:14] <Richhh> whats wrong with the second line ?     d1val = $(this).val();    d1date = new Date(d1val.getTime());
[13:26:53] <derPepo> new Date().getTime()
[13:27:08] <Richhh> k
[13:27:22] <scar> i keep getting 0 returned in my ajax query--- mail() isnt responding at the beginning of my ajax action function, yet i am getting success on my ajax call, just i cant get the php code in wordpress to work-- i even tried echo json_encode('test'); die(); first line, and still get 0 -- but get a success in jquery
[13:27:29] <scar> didnt know if it was a weird jquery thing as well
[13:32:25] <Richhh> problem:   http://jsfiddle.net/UVSs6/
[13:33:57] <Eviltwin> Wow, still working on that one?
[13:34:05] <Richhh> yep lol
[13:34:55] <Richhh> got the jqueryui one working
[13:35:03] <Richhh> got the html5 date minimum = today working
[13:35:08] <Richhh> but cant figure this one out yet
[13:36:15] <Richhh> http://jsfiddle.net/UVSs6/1/
[13:38:52] <LSshock> can i create a new var based on an ID i got using > $('.box').attr('id')
[13:39:53] <Richhh> ok so the dates value is not a date object
[13:39:58] <Richhh> lets ee
[13:40:01] <Richhh> see
[13:41:40] <Eviltwin> LSshock: Please don't
[13:42:05] <crankharder> how do i select elements that do not :contains('some text') ?
[13:42:14] <Eviltwin> crankharder: You use :not
[13:42:28] <crankharder> $("div:not:contains('foo')") => cannot call method 'match' of undefined'
[13:42:33] <Eviltwin> Parentheses
[13:42:50] <crankharder> $("div:not(:contains('foo'))") returns way more objects than there really are
[13:43:20] <LSshock> Eviltwin: fine but i got no clue how to do what i need to do.. so its best to show it, http://jsfiddle.net/ideaprison/8uv2e/24/ this worked fine when i had only 1 box, now i'm adjusting the code to support more than 1 box of records. So i'm not sure how i can keep up with the index of each box (so which record is shown) so that the navigation keeps working as it should
[13:44:42] <crankharder> Eviltwin: other ideas?
[13:44:51] <usrb1n> hello guys, I have a problem that drives me crazy. I tried to fix this in last 48 hours and I'm about to delete everything :)
[13:44:57] <usrb1n> I'm new in jquery so please don't be bad
[13:45:06] <usrb1n> I have a div that is show only when a link is clicked
[13:45:09] <usrb1n> that works very fine.
[13:45:28] <usrb1n> But I want to set it so when the submit button on a form is clicked it should be displayed
[13:45:41] <usrb1n> I tried with onsubmit="function()"
[13:45:44] <usrb1n> on the form
[13:45:52] <usrb1n> but can't get it working
[13:46:37] <crankharder> $('form').submit(function(){/*do stuff */})
[13:46:42] <gnarf> crankharder: $("div").filter(function() { return $(this).text().indexOf("some text") === -1; })
[13:47:10] <Eviltwin> LSshock: Perhaps this could help you: http://jsfiddle.net/meuRk/
[13:47:13] <hlve> is there any reason why .val(''); wouldn't change the val of a input?
[13:47:32] <hlve> problem is, is that it works on jsfiddle, but not on my production env.
[13:47:32] <hlve> :(
[13:47:50] <LSshock> fantastic thanks Eviltwin
[13:48:02] <LSshock> gives me a good idea how to do ti
[13:48:08] <gnarf> hlve: have you tried using a debugger to figure out WHY it isn't working?
[13:49:26] <gnarf> hlve: .val() is pretty straight forward, I can only imagine it failing if a) its not a jQuery object you're calling it on - b) it's first element is not an input - c) the input you are changing isn't the one you think it is
[13:49:47] <gnarf> d) some OTHER thing is changing the value back
[13:49:48] <gnarf> i mean
[13:49:53] <NoiseEee> hlve: surely your debugger has some insight
[13:49:54] <gnarf> tons of possibles
[13:50:15] <hlve> There's no breaking point, but I'm thinking it's d), as it has another on blur being called
[13:50:30] <NoiseEee> don't think, use your debugger and profile / step through / etc
[13:51:03] <hlve> jsbin wasn't finding anything wrong with the code. and when I tried it on jsfiddle, it was working 100%.
[13:51:03] <hlve> lol
[13:51:12] <hlve> One sec. I think I figured it out.
[13:51:29] <Morkel> i have a problem with this https://gist.github.com/3861316 coffeescript/jquery. When i add an alert everything works without not
[13:51:58] <Eviltwin> LSshock: Also my example uses the event delegation syntax of .on instead of .live which is deprecated in the current version of jQuery
[13:52:09] <gnarf> Morkel: sounds like you're trying to use a value that is set in an async operation
[13:52:19] <Eviltwin> LSshock: This page explains how you can do the same thing as .live using .on: http://api.jquery.com/live/
[13:52:30] <Morkel> gnarf: what do you mean?
[13:52:36] <usrb1n> theank you very much crankharder
[13:52:38] <usrb1n> :)
[13:52:59] <gnarf> Morkel: i dunno - looking at the code, i don't see why it would make any difference
[13:53:00] <cusco> hlve: try js: element.value = ''
[13:53:01] <gnarf> but who knows
[13:53:05] <gnarf> thats in coffee
[13:53:39] <gnarf> that syntax makes 0 sense to me
[13:53:42] <digitalmediaguy> Hey ya'll I am having a heck of a time getting 4 handles to properly resize my div after appending it with an onClickâ€¦ I was hoping someone might be able to take a gander? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12808217/how-can-i-make-all-4-corners-of-my-div-have-resizable-handles-with-jquery
[13:53:51] <gnarf> Morkel: can you give me the .js ?
[13:55:06] <LSshock> thanks Eviltwin
[13:55:45] <gnarf> Morkel: also, can you console.log( $('#results tbody tr') ) -- I wonder if its actually there when you don't alert
[13:56:38] <digitalmediaguy> 3 of the 8 possible handles work! (right side, bottom side & bottom right corner) - I however can't get the others to work for some reason
[13:56:40] <Morkel> gnarf: i added the js code to the gist https://gist.github.com/3861316
[13:57:39] <ericincoldohio> I'm trying to append html that's returned from a webservice call to a "<td>" , when I try to set html =
[13:57:51] <ericincoldohio> 'xxx' works fine, when I try to use the html, doesn't work, no error
[13:58:00] <gnarf> Morkel: thanks, add some console.log() see if you can figure it out
[13:58:23] <gnarf> Morkel: don't debug with alert()
[13:58:44] <ericincoldohio> If I take the html returned from the web service and dump it to a div, works fine...is there something special about td?
[13:59:45] <Morkel> gnarf: where should i add the console.log? In the search or clickable_table function
[14:00:14] <gnarf> Morkel: yes - and in the click handler -- log something important, like say the length of the set
[14:00:25] <gnarf> Morkel: add a ton of console loggin
[14:00:40] <gnarf> Morkel: track it down
[14:00:47] <gnarf> Morkel: the alert() shouldn't make a lick of difference
[14:01:08] <gnarf> also, try breakpoints
[14:01:24] <gnarf> step debugging
[14:01:25] <gnarf> etc
[14:01:31] <gnarf> alert() is terrible
[14:02:02] <Morkel> gnarf: Thx i will debug it this way. I never debugged js code
[14:02:18] <gnarf> ?ftj @Morkel
[14:02:18] <bot-t> Morkel, Fixing These jQuery: A Guide to Debugging - http://fixingthesejquery.com
[14:12:41] <hlve> So. this is a live example of my broken code. http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/DHZNv/233/ --> The clearall div only works when you first load the code. after you start typing, it stops clearing if you click it.
[14:13:20] <hlve> No breaking points, but I'm assuming it has to do with the inline JS that's on the input that's preventing it from actually clearing
[14:13:25] <hlve> Any idears?
[14:14:38] <Richhh> Eviltwin
[14:14:40] <Richhh> http://jsfiddle.net/UVSs6/2/
[14:14:41] <Richhh> tada
[14:14:49] <Richhh> xD
[14:15:59] <usrb1n> os
[14:16:00] <NoiseEee> why is there inline js hlve?
[14:16:02] <usrb1n> mc
[14:17:03] <hlve> NoiseEee, it's just how the simplecontentsearch had it coded. I tried updating it to use external jquery, but it failed miserably
[14:17:34] <NoiseEee> hlve: inline js has no place.  this is a great example of why not to use it
[14:17:47] <plato> hi, i'm pretty new to jquery, I need to programmatically put together a list of links. i am doing forEach... $('<a/>', {text:'foo', id:'bar'}) which fails horribly
[14:17:47] <NoiseEee> hlve: figure out how to take it out and replace it elsewhere
[14:17:57] <Richhh> but gotta stop them setting dates in reverse order and screwing it up now
[14:18:17] <plato> actually more accurately it would be $('<a/>', {text:foo, id:bar}) as foo and bar change per element
[14:18:37] <NoiseEee> plato: how does it 'fail horribly'
[14:18:42] <plato> i cannot find which page on jquery API doc covers the very basics of creating elements, setting classes, ids, text
[14:19:05] <plato> NoiseEee: unexpected }
[14:19:42] <NoiseEee> an example is  var myNewA = $('<a>',{text:'foo',id:'bar'});
[14:20:12] <NoiseEee> plato: so either you have a typo you're glossing over or what you typed ^^ isn't really happening
[14:20:43] <plato> no trailing slash in the <a/> ?
[14:20:53] <usrb1n> it is ls
[14:21:46] <NoiseEee> plato: unnecessary
[14:22:14] <plato> OK great that works. Now I remember what i did, I ws putting href=bar in that options object
[14:22:18] <PaladinPSK> In Jquery, when you have an AJAX request that functions on click that works correctly, but STOPS WORKING after you cut up the page into partials and place them in seperate files but LOAD them through a page in the same order; is there a way to know why that jquery ajax function no longer works?
[14:22:36] <NoiseEee> plato: right, so you want href:bar
[14:23:13] <plato> ok that fails
[14:23:25] <plato> wait another typo
[14:23:51] <plato> mmk, its working fine now, thxd
[14:24:12] <NoiseEee> np
[14:24:25] <bobson__> Does anyone know why my click handler on body is being called at the same time I click on topPanel?  Code: http://jsfiddle.net/PzSHN/2/
[14:25:28] <PaladinPSK> bobson__ Have you tried using toggle? Right now it automatically slides down and then slides right back up.
[14:25:41] <PaladinPSK> Off of that single click. it's just going in order.
[14:25:57] <bobson__> How would I toggle
[14:26:15] <PaladinPSK> http://api.jquery.com/toggle-event/
[14:26:26] <PaladinPSK> Use that toggle event to bind it properly.
[14:26:55] <PaladinPSK> You would use .toggle for each function like in the first example.
[14:28:04] <bobson__> There are two different ids to be handled, topPanel and body.  I dont see how I can toggle
[14:29:03] <shoky> bobsapp:  e.stopPropagation()
[14:29:15] <NoiseEee> bobson__: ^^
[14:29:18] <shoky> er, bobson__
[14:29:39] <bobson__> stopPropagation blocks it from ever closing :/
[14:29:49] <shoky> no it doesnt
[14:29:59] <shoky> see here: http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/PzSHN/3/
[14:30:02] <NoiseEee> bobson__: understand that you've put a listener on the entire <body>, so of course anything clicked in <body> will fire that
[14:30:06] <shoky> notice the height:100%  on html & body
[14:30:20] <bobson__> NoiseEee: but it's in the callback of the first click
[14:30:30] <bobson__> and it off's instantly
[14:30:37] <NoiseEee> no
[14:32:30] <bobson__> stoppropagation worked thanks shoky.  had made a code edit and forgot to remove it so i thought it didnt work
[14:34:07] <NoiseEee> bobson__: personally i'd http://jsfiddle.net/PzSHN/4/
[14:34:10] <NoiseEee> one listener
[14:34:17] <shoky> bobson__: btw that first 'if' would me much better written as:  if (this.id == 'topPanel')
[14:34:19] <NoiseEee> bah sorry messed up
[14:34:31] <NoiseEee> my codes got overwritten
[14:34:42] <NoiseEee> anyways i'd put a single listener on body, and then inquire within as to what to do
[14:34:44] <shoky> er and i forgot the !  ;]
[14:34:54] <shoky> !=  that is :\
[14:35:14] <bobson__> NoiseEee: check console http://jsfiddle.net/PzSHN/5/
[14:35:20] <JFranks> I love the new extensions but all new things come with bugs: http://i46.tinypic.com/330a2kp.jpg
[14:35:39] <bobson__> it keeps calling slideUp, doesnt rebind thankfully due to jquery checking
[14:35:50] <bobson__> shoky:  good point thx
[14:36:14] <usrb1n> hello, I'm trying to get a form text box content and set it in windows.location.
[14:36:18] <usrb1n> I used this: window.location = "http://example.com/script.php?id=" + $(this).serialize();
[14:36:32] <usrb1n> in the .submit(function() {
[14:36:46] <usrb1n> but it redirects me to http://example.com/script.php?id=
[14:36:50] <usrb1n> without the parameter
[14:37:06] <NoiseEee> bobson__: http://jsfiddle.net/PzSHN/6/
[14:37:28] <usrb1n> should I make a var ? like var variable = $(this).serialize(); and then  window.location = "http://example.com/script.php?id=" + variable; ?
[14:37:40] <toddWork> is this the right way to get that unique jQuery DOM element: http://jsfiddle.net/xVGP7/

[14:38:19] <bobson__> NoiseEee: that's nice but a binding I dont always need permanently active.
[14:38:30] <shoky> scar:  .siblings()   .next()  .prev()  ...

[14:42:21] <jenia_> hello everyone.
[14:42:40] <jenia_> i'm having a problem with $.post.
[14:43:49] <jenia_> im seding a post request from page A, if the use ris not authenticated, then i transfer him to page B and keep what ever was posted in window.localStorage.setItem(JSON.stringify(post_object))
[14:44:10] <jenia_> then on page page b i do this:
[14:45:07] <jenia_> $.post('/login', eval('('+window.localStorage.getItem('post_object')+')')
[14:45:12] <JFranks> Jen: Try to put your code into a site like 'jsfiddle/net' and then give us a link with a question.. ;)
[14:45:25] <jenia_> okay
[14:45:56] <JFranks> (Most of the time me re-doing my work on that site actually solves the problem.. )
[14:46:32] <jenia_> my example requires two pages for demonstration
[14:48:17] <JFranks> Hmmm yeah I've never gone as far as testing posts/ajax on there.. but I believe there's some mechanisms to help you do that.. ?
[14:50:21] <toddWork> ignore my q. i figured it out. thank you all.
[14:51:15] <jgornick> Hey guys, I have a form where I'm programmatically setting the values of the form fields. When I call the reset method on the form, it resets all fields back to empty. Is there a way to set the form fields and have those persisted as the default values so when reset is called on the form, it'll reset to those values?
[14:54:00] <jenia_> http://pastebin.com/yFa6vfZY
[14:54:04] <jenia_> this is the code
[14:54:44] <jenia_> and i only get the usename, password in the server side
[14:55:06] <jenia_> ahh no
[14:55:13] <JFranks> jgornick: yep.. same basic thing jenia_ is working on.. just save them to the window as a global when the form clearing action fires, then re-assign the window variables to the form elements as values after the form is cleared.. More javascript than jquery IMO. ;)
[14:58:32] <alien_talk> hey can anyone exaplin to me why this isn't working? http://pastie.org/5026574  I have multiple ID's named retrack and they also have a 'playerstatusid' value too
[14:59:59] <JFranks> If you're really keen you'll actually have some timeouts that reset onkeyup, and if the timeout actually fires (ie: no keyup event for a second) it can store the field data/do validation checks.. This way if a user loses the form data they can resume the form almost exactly where they left off and nothing is triggered until they stop typing/finish an input..
[15:00:04] <mib_mib> hi guys - using jquery-ui draggable and dropable - when i drag a #draggble div on top of a #dropable div, i want the #dropbable div to get the text from the #dragable div and write it on it - i'm using the function(event, ui) to get the event when its dropped, and trying to do $(ui).text() to get the text of the draggable element but its empty - how do i get the text from the draggable element?
[15:00:55] <silverwind> alien_talk: IDs are.... identifiers, so they're unique
[15:01:13] <silverwind> What's the point of an id if more than one thing can have it..
[15:01:21] <alien_talk> silverwind, how should i group them to have the same function
[15:01:29] <silverwind> alien_talk: Classes.
[15:02:12] <alien_talk> okay changed it to classes
[15:02:20] <alien_talk> how do i get
[15:02:40] <alien_talk> the custom attribute value?
[15:02:46] <mfoxdogg|work> morning all
[15:03:34] <silverwind> alien_talk: var lol = roflmao.attr('the-attribute-you-need') ?
[15:03:49] <silverwind> (roflmao being a node you selected)
[15:04:20] <alien_talk> and if it's inside a $('.new-class').click(function() {
[15:04:58] <digitalmediaguy> Hey everyoneâ€¦ I am trying out a way to map the position of divs within a containerâ€¦ and then if the user changes the window sizeâ€¦ scale down / re-map those divs to there same relative positions with the smaller window sizeâ€¦ Does that make any sense?
[15:05:58] <alien_talk> $(this)
[15:06:00] <alien_talk> k
[15:10:23] <mib_mib> why when i click a draggable element is it immeidately 'jumping' up like 50 pixels
[15:13:14] <usrb1n> I have a show/hide div function and it works when I click on a link. I added the form validation under the function and now it displays the div always
[15:13:33] <usrb1n> Is there any reason for this? should I close the <script> and open another for the form.submit ?
[15:15:09] <usrb1n> http://pastebin.com/Zcy7JPz4
[15:15:21] <usrb1n> so if I remove the form submit
[15:15:25] <usrb1n> the show/hide div works fine
[15:15:32] <usrb1n> if I add, the div is always on
[15:17:01] <w00tner> sedf\
[15:17:55] <usrb1n> It' strange, after the this messed up, I removed the form.submit again and let the code just as it was before (and was working)
[15:18:02] <usrb1n> and now it show the div always too
[15:34:36] <JFranks> Hmmm I want to ditch '<select>' in my forms and use .menu() .. here's an example of what I was thinking, but I'm hitting lots of hurdles.. http://jsfiddle.net/zqUWb/
[15:36:06] <JFranks> Ie: You should see the 'selected' item after accessing the .menu() .. and clicking the menu should make the sub-menu stay up for navigation.. Not even at the 'what will be submitted when the form is posted' part yet.. ;)
[15:36:29] <shoky> usrb1n:  you are missing a closing }  for the ajax options object literal
[15:36:50] <shoky> usrb1n: before the 'return false'
[15:39:28] <usrb1n> damn, yea was that
[15:39:42] <usrb1n> I just copied again the .submit code I had on a file copy and worked
[15:39:46] <usrb1n> thank you very much shoky
[15:43:08] <tw2113> shoky, are you being helpful again?
[15:43:16] <canolucas> hi, i have an img inside a div. i would like to do some animation when onmouseover and onmouseout. the content dynamically changes so i have to use live to trigger "hover".. but the event triggers when i move the mouse inside de div a lot of times, and not only onmouseenter or onmouselive (what i want).. this happens when i do jQuery("#thumbDiv").live("hover", function() { ... }); and even when i do jQuery("#thumbDiv").live({ onmouseover: function(){
[15:43:16] <canolucas>  ... }, onmouseout: function() { ... } });
[15:43:22] <canolucas> i am really clueless
[15:44:12] <rand0mbytes> what's faster, :not selector or .not function?
[15:44:25] <BinaryKitten> canolucas hi
[15:44:35] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, hi
[15:44:41] <BinaryKitten> canolucas the event function gets passed an event item
[15:44:48] <BinaryKitten> it has a target property
[15:44:55] <BinaryKitten> which you can check
[15:45:11] <BinaryKitten> also, .live is deprecated
[15:45:24] <BinaryKitten> does #thumbDiv have an immediate parent?
[15:46:01] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, i tried to replace .live with .on, but it doesn't work if the content changes
[15:46:08] <BinaryKitten> yes i know
[15:46:10] <BinaryKitten> does #thumbDiv have an immediate parent?
[15:46:13] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, so i had to stick
[15:46:24] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, with it. yes
[15:46:46] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, #thumbDiv is child of #container
[15:47:05] <BinaryKitten> ok because .live = to $(document).on(event, '#thumbDiv', fn);
[15:47:37] <BinaryKitten> change document in that to the closest parent that doesn't change
[15:47:55] <canolucas> BinaryKitten: cool
[15:47:58] <BinaryKitten> once done, the fn takes an event as argument
[15:48:08] <BinaryKitten> eg function(e) { ..
[15:48:27] <BinaryKitten> with that you can do if (e.target == this) { .....
[15:48:59] <canolucas> BinaryKitten: do i have to create this objet called "e", or it is already there  ?
[15:49:04] <shoky> canolucas have you tried mouseenter/mouseleave instead of mouseover/mouseout
[15:49:19] <canolucas> shoky, yes, thanks anyways
[15:49:21] <BinaryKitten> canolucas it's passed to the function
[15:49:40] <BinaryKitten> so as long as you add something for it to be assigned to, you're golden
[15:49:57] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, but do i have to declare it.. var e = ...
[15:50:04] <BinaryKitten> no
[15:50:07] <canolucas> cool
[15:50:08] <BinaryKitten> it's passed in
[15:50:16] <BinaryKitten> so you need it in the function definition
[15:50:31] <BinaryKitten> eg function(e) { /* code here has e defined */ }
[15:50:54] <canolucas> its a global object
[15:50:58] <canolucas> got it
[15:51:26] <shoky> local function argument..
[15:52:34] <BinaryKitten> thnx shoky
[15:52:40] <vacho> guys,..
[15:52:47] * BinaryKitten is too tired, would normally argue on the semantic
[15:52:48] <canolucas> ok so
[15:52:49] <vacho> can I ajax load content from a different domain to my site?
[15:52:59] <BinaryKitten> yes and no vacho
[15:53:00] <vacho> want to remotely load some data into a div.. but the ajax call goes to a different server.
[15:53:29] <BinaryKitten> yes you can, but no not easily
[15:53:38] <BinaryKitten> there's a lot of stuff you have to configure
[15:53:41] <vacho> it's not the right thing to do?
[15:53:41] <BinaryKitten> like CORRS
[15:53:57] <BinaryKitten> browser security by default blocks such behaviour
[15:54:14] <shoky> *CORS  in case someone goes searching
[15:54:27] <BinaryKitten> heh yep sorry
[15:54:29] <vacho> ok thanks i'll figure out something differenet.
[15:54:32] <BinaryKitten> been a 16hr work day
[15:54:39] <BinaryKitten> just got in
[15:54:45] <shoky> ouchie
[15:54:48] <BinaryKitten> and best go to bed
[15:55:00] <BinaryKitten> got to go back in 6hrs
[15:55:05] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, you mean something like this ? var myselection = jQuery("thumbDiv").not("img"); if (event.target == myselection) { ...do stuff }
[15:55:19] <BinaryKitten> urm no canolucas
[15:55:38] <BinaryKitten> event.target will never match a jquery object
[15:55:44] <leehambley> hi all, I'm trying to do something with $.ajax to replicate this CURL call `curl -v -s -X GET -d 'matching[][name]=ottensen' http://localhost:3000/locations`, I expected to be able to use `data: { "matching": [{"name":"ottensen"}]}`, but jQuery errornously insert a zero into the mix, sending "{"0"=>{"name"=>"ottensen"}}" to the server, but curl sends "[{"name"=>"ottensen"}]" - how can I trick jQuery into doing what I want ?
[15:55:56] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, will match a string then
[15:56:00] <BinaryKitten> no
[15:56:04] <BinaryKitten> it matches an element
[15:56:10] <BinaryKitten> which is what "this" is
[15:56:11] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, oh
[15:56:33] <BinaryKitten> remember   if (e.target == this) { .....
[15:56:58] <BinaryKitten> this = event the iterm is happening on
[15:57:02] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, but "this" also triggers the event when i mouse the mouse inside the div.. because of the img change
[15:57:05] <BinaryKitten> e.target is the one that triggered it
[15:57:26] * BinaryKitten gives up
[15:57:51] * BinaryKitten is waaay to tired to have any patience for circle dancing...
[15:57:55] <BinaryKitten> gnight all
[15:57:59] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, so "this" will never match the img inside the div
[15:58:06] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, ?
[15:58:17] <BinaryKitten> canolucas ask someone else
[15:58:22] <BinaryKitten> i need to sleep
[15:58:24] <shoky> leehambley, not 100% sure what you need but have you tried:  `data: { "matching": {"name":"ottensen"} }`
[15:58:36] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, ok good night
[15:58:38] <leehambley> unfortunately that's the problem it has to be an array of hashes
[15:58:42] <shoky> night BK
[15:58:53] <leehambley> but jQuery is turning the array into a string-zero indexed hash :S
[15:59:09] <leehambley> I'm reading something about manaully setting content type, and sending the object via JSON.stringify() first
[15:59:14] <canolucas> BinaryKitten, btw got it
[16:05:38] <digitalmediaguy> Goodnessâ€¦ Stuck hereâ€¦ Hoping one of you fine geniuses will be able to help? ;)  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12809669/how-to-resize-scale-reposition-all-divs-accordingly-when-the-browser-window
[16:09:10] <shoky> digitalmediaguy i've done very similar stuff to that.. you answered yourself: I am looking for a way to track the position of ALL OF THE APPENDED DIVS using some sort of variable per div maybe?! Using either javascript or jquery?? Then I need to be able to update that variable if/when the divs are resized or dragged around the container!
[16:09:51] <shoky> so: use a variable per div ,  use javascript & jquery,  update the variables (objects) when the divs are resized or dragged
[16:09:59] <shoky> all good ideas.
[16:12:39] <slick-> hey, if i fetch an xml file which contains <element id="776856"  parentid="124476">
[16:12:50] <slick-> how do i tell it to get the parentis of elementid=776856
[16:13:29] <lsterling> Hello. Can anyone help me add ascending ID #s to a list of items? My fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/hEfZD/
[16:14:41] <slick-> can someone please help me
[16:14:46] <tw2113> lsterling, http://jsfiddle.net/hEfZD/1/
[16:15:02] <tw2113> loaded jquery and change $js to $
[16:15:37] <lsterling> @tw2113 thank you!  - ha, it's been a long day. whew.
[16:15:50] <razzi> slick you are parsing an xml in js?
[16:15:54] <razzi> slick-*
[16:16:02] <slick-> yes
[16:18:17] <razzi> slick-, probably something like this : var $xml = $.parseXML( data ); var $parent = $xml.find('#776856').parent();
[16:18:36] <slick-> oh
[16:18:41] <razzi> not 100% since i never used parseXML().
[16:18:46] <shoky> almost
[16:18:47] <razzi> 100% sure..
[16:18:54] <shoky> var $xml = $( $.parseXML( data ) );
[16:19:06] <slick-> so how would i fetch the xml file
[16:19:16] <razzi> yeah right
[16:19:23] <slick-> 		$.ajax({
[16:19:23] <slick-> 		    type: "GET",
[16:19:25] <slick-> 			url: "http://esi.ctv.ca/datafeed/pubsetservice.aspx?sid=2962",
[16:19:26] <slick-> 			dataType: "xml",
[16:19:28] <slick-> 			success: function(xml) {
[16:19:29] <slick-> 			alert('success');
[16:19:31] <slick-> 			}
[16:19:31] <slick-> 		});
[16:19:32] <slick-> like that?
[16:19:42] <shoky> but i think he meant:  var $xml = $( $.parseXML( data ) );  var $parent = $xml.find( '#' + $xml.find('#776856').attr('parent') )
[16:19:59] <shoky> .attr('parentid')
[16:20:24] <shoky> slick-: dont paste more than one line of code in the channel
[16:20:27] <slick-> sorry
[16:21:36] <slick-> does this make sense shoky http://jsfiddle.net/6fcTe/
[16:22:06] <shoky> yea if you change 'parent' to 'parentid'  and assuming that's the logic you were asking for..
[16:22:13] <slick-> awesome
[16:22:18] <slick-> do you think the fetching of the xml is done right?
[16:22:32] <shoky> it looks fine..
[16:22:36] <shoky> but i cant really know
[16:22:54] <shoky> depends on the server api
[16:24:10] <slick-> i could test this in jsfiddle no?
[16:24:18] <slick-> alert($parentid)?
[16:24:41] <slick-> http://jsfiddle.net/6fcTe/1/
[16:24:41] <slick-> ?
[16:24:45] <digitalmediaguy> Hmmmmâ€¦ Yeahâ€¦ I get how to do itâ€¦ In theoryâ€¦ I am just not sure how I would create the variables that are unique to the appended divsâ€¦ Like generate a random id? hmmmmâ€¦. do you think it would be better / more reliable to do this with ajax? and write the coordinates to the db?
[16:25:00] <digitalmediaguy> possible to do all with jquery?
[16:26:35] <shoky> digitalmediaguy: you are asking so many questions, it's impossible to give a good answer
[16:27:17] <shoky> digitalmediaguy: consider using some MVC lib/framework to help make a clear seperation between your views and your model objects
[16:27:36] <slick-> any idea why this code isnt working http://jsfiddle.net/6fcTe/7/
[16:27:38] <shoky> i like knockout.js
[16:27:47] <shoky> and have done similar stuff with it
[16:28:16] <digitalmediaguy> Yeahâ€¦ it's on zendâ€¦ I am just trying to architect this thingâ€¦. I know it's kinda a hodgepodge of questionsâ€¦ Just trying yo find the best solution
[16:28:18] <shoky> slick-:  are you asking why it doesnt work on the fiddle?
[16:28:25] <slick-> yes
[16:28:41] <shoky> slick-: because it's not on the same domain
[16:28:49] <slick-> we should be able to fetch the xml
[16:28:51] <shoky> heard of SOP?
[16:28:51] <slick-> from different domains
[16:29:09] <shoky> that isn't necessarily possible
[16:29:19] <shoky> only if the server supports it
[16:29:37] <shoky> using CORS or JSONP for example
[16:29:43] <RohanBhangui> \join ##java
[16:29:54] <shoky> or using a server-side proxy
[16:29:54] <leehambley> I've formalized my question a bit to SO, so there's some rep in it for anyone who'd like to pick me up there? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12809837/enumerable-get-and-post-params-with-jquery-curl-example-given
[16:39:06] <shoky> leehambley well you could do:    data: 'matching[][name]=ottensen'
[16:39:15] <shoky> ;S
[16:42:30] <shoky> oh its a get
[16:44:15] <shoky> well either way
[16:44:31] <shoky> hm.
[16:45:44] <lsterling> Does anyone know why a certain part of my javascript wouldn't load again when you hit the back button?
[16:46:20] <lsterling> http://www.28media.com/clients/bonsecours/ <-- If you hit the back button after click on one of the images, the slider no longer loads.
[16:46:36] <lsterling> I believe it's the #fade-wrapper that's not fading in.
[16:49:23] <leehambley> yeah, it being a get is a bit weird :S
[16:49:36] <leehambley> thanks shoky
[16:50:56] <shoky> yea i donno much about GET requests with POST data ;]
[17:11:48] <burg> hello. from a list of elements, how can i see if one of them has a defined id?

[17:29:40] <rodyhaddad> Hey guys, I just wanted to know: How can I make CORS work with jQuery? I have my server sending the right header, but when I do $.post("otherdomain"), the browser stills throws the cross-domain error. Is there something special I need to do for jQuery to work with CORS?
[17:32:07] <r1card> How can I erase all per-element styles from an element.
[17:32:26] <imsky> el.style=""
[17:32:31] <imsky> NO WAIT
[17:32:36] <imsky> $(el).attr("style","");
[17:39:00] <r1card> imsky, thanks, I'll try right now :D
[17:39:44] <r1card> imsky, jesus I didn't think it'll be so simple :D
[17:39:46] <r1card> Thanks man
[17:40:48] <imsky> r1card: nobody ever does
[17:43:39] <shoky> rodyhaddad: afaik you don't have to do anything special.. except maybe on IE<10
[17:50:44] <quuxman> <rant> What is up with the History API? I can not figure out the logic it uses for escaping shit. h.replaceState({ }, 'Dumbstuff', '/foo%20bar') puts '/foo%20bar' in the URL, where '/foo%23bar' results in '/foo#bar', and '/foo#bar' results in '/foo#bar'. WTF????
[17:51:08] <quuxman> how do I get '/foo%23bar' in the address bar?
[17:51:53] <quuxman> oh, and '/escape?foo=%2523this' also results in '/foo#bar'. Is it even possible?
[17:52:45] <quuxman> </rant>
[17:55:22] <ngharo> these PEANUTS are MAKING ME THIRSTY
[17:59:46] <[fields]> I am having issues setting a datepicker, can anyone suggest what I should be doing differently?  var d = new Date(milliseconds); $('#when').datepicker({"defaultDate": d, "showButtonPanel":  false});
[18:00:31] <[fields]> where milliseconds has an appropriate value
[18:02:47] <clondike> are you sure the milliseconds are valid?
[18:02:56] <clondike> because the syntax looks good
[18:03:06] <[fields]> pretty sure, 1351733400000
[18:03:24] <Foxhoundz> WHat's the official room for jQuery UI
[18:03:41] <[fields]> Foxhoundz: I didn't see much of anyone in #jqueryui , so I asked my question here
[18:04:27] <[fields]> clondike: its odd because that code renders the datepicker, but its set date remains Today's
[18:05:01] <[fields]> should be a date soon in 22 days
[18:05:51] <clondike> [fields]: does it work if you set the date manually later with http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-setDate ?
[18:07:16] <MistuhKurtz> Does a context selector like $("a, #nav") offer any speed improvement over something like $("#nav a") ?
[18:08:18] <Eviltwin> You mean $("a", "#nav")
[18:08:19] <Eviltwin> And no
[18:08:28] <Eviltwin> It's essentially the slowest form of the selector
[18:11:40] <gowie> Is there a way I can pass around the $('').hide and $('').show methods and then call them on a jquery object through call or apply?
[18:13:05] <gowie> Can't seem to get it to work, and I think it's because I am not sure how I should be getting/passing around the function from jquery
[18:14:16] <clondike> apparently you can, gowie http://jsfiddle.net/QGYN5/
[18:14:24] <clondike> not sure why you would though
[18:14:48] <gowie> clondike Awesome that's exactly what I need.
[18:15:30] <gowie> clondike It's to slim down this big ugly conditional i have and throw it into a helper function which i can just pass those methods into an array
[18:15:43] <clondike> oh cool. good luck!
[18:15:55] <gowie> clondike Thanks man! Appreciate the help!
[18:17:09] <quuxman> MistuhKurtz: definitely not. All the ids on a page are stored in a dictionary type data structure, and so id selectors by themselves are the fastest things
[18:17:44] <MistuhKurtz> cool thanks quuxman & Eviltwin
[18:17:56] <quuxman> MistuhKurtz: if jquery was smarter than it needed to be, it would optimize out the 'a ' in the beginning entirely, because it's redundant. However, it's far more reasonable to just leave it out
[18:21:40] <[fields]> clondike:  unfortunately no, nothing I've tried has set the datepicker.  I tried using setDate after rendering , tried setting it at time of render, no js errors, looks like it is set to today.
[18:21:57] <quuxman> is there a channel for web api bullshit?
[18:22:26] <quuxman> sometimes I get great responses in here, but it's clearly not what the channel is about
[18:28:28] <MistuhKurtz> quuxman, what do you mean by 'web api bullshit' ?
[18:28:36] <MistuhKurtz> you mean APIs in general?
[18:29:08] <MistuhKurtz> I feel like there should be rooms dedicated to specific APIs for the more popular ones
[18:29:30] <tw2113> MistuhKurtz, all the html5 stuff, history api in quuxman's case
[18:29:43] <MistuhKurtz> ah
[18:31:01] <clondike> [fields]: want to get a demo up at jsfiddle?
[18:31:40] <[fields]> clondike
[18:32:02] <[fields]> ok
[18:32:14] <tw2113> what would I do for a clondike bar? I dunno, is there a plugin for it?
[18:32:50] <Foxhoundz> I have a list of jQuery sliders that the user sets to various values. They all have a common class I gave them.  Basically, I want to get the current value for each one but for some reason, $.each($('.my-sliders'),function(k,v) { v.slider('value'); }); doesn't seem to work.
[18:33:04] <Foxhoundz> I'm sure this is an error on my part, but I can't figure this out
[18:39:14] <quuxman> MistuhKurtz, tw2113: yeah, and even weird CSS stuff and bizarre JavaScript behavior, JS techniques, just a general purpose web dev channel for people asking and answering in depth technical questions
[18:39:40] <MistuhKurtz> quuxman, #web fits "general" web stuff, whether front-end or back-end
[18:39:58] <quuxman> I'm looking specifically for a front-end channel, but that sounds close enough
[18:40:01] <MistuhKurtz> #css and #javascript can supplement
[18:40:49] <quuxman> I figured out what's going on with the History API. I'm actually using History.js by Benjamin Arthur Lupton, and there's a normalizeState function that's Fing up '#'s
[18:41:09] <[fields]> clondike:  jsfiddle.net doesn't seem to offer jquery-ui
[18:41:20] <tw2113> #html5 could probably handle some
[18:41:50] <clondike> you can add it yourself with the resource bit on the left, [fields]
[18:42:01] <clondike> just paste a CDN URL for the JS and the CSS
[18:51:34] <[fields]> http://jsfiddle.net/uBdab/
[18:51:44] <clondike> thx
[18:51:48] <[fields]> ty
[18:53:08] <clondike> and now a version without syntax errors: http://jsfiddle.net/uBdab/1/
[18:54:58] <[fields]> I thought I gave you a bad copy at first
[18:55:11] <[fields]> and quickly got http://jsfiddle.net/uBdab/2/ which looks good
[18:55:15] <[fields]> but I see no difference in code
[18:55:21] <[fields]> did you change anything at all?
[18:56:35] <clondike> var row = {}; instead of var row.whatever = ...
[18:57:55] <clondike> [fields]: http://jsfiddle.net/uBdab/3/
[18:57:57] <clondike> that works for me
[18:58:13] <clondike> in that i see november 1 with the timestamp you gave
[18:59:44] <[fields]> hmm, supposed to be 9:30pm on 10/31
[19:00:29] <[fields]> I know I'm not setting the time ui yet
[19:00:57] <[fields]> oh, I'm seeing the difference now
[19:01:08] <codephobic> hi
[19:01:49] <clondike> ?eval new Date(1351733400000)
[19:01:52] <bot-t> clondike: <2012-11-01T01:30:00.000Z>
[19:02:03] <clondike> thanks bot-t
[19:02:03] <bot-t> clondike, I'm a bot you know..
[19:02:11] <codephobic> Is it possible to send an object as the "data" property within an ajax function?
[19:11:53] <[fields]> clondike: seems to work in a browser, but not as this PhoneGap app I am working on
[19:12:36] <clondike> AH
[19:12:41] <clondike> that's a big ol' caveat
[19:12:50] <[fields]> big ol'
[19:12:58] <clondike> i am surprised you can get it working at all in phonegap
[19:13:03] <[fields]> now I gotta find a new calendar widget and start my project over
[19:13:06] <clondike> i gave up on ui in phonegap
[19:13:15] <codephobic> Is it possible to send an object as the "data" property within an ajax function?
[19:13:30] <[fields]> phonegap is pretty sweet... this is the first trouble i've had.  but I have noticed some slow response times recently on this project.  I've done a few projects with PhoneGap + jQuery
[19:14:21] <[fields]> clondike:  good so you have PhoneGap experience, can you recommend a datepicker of calendar style like jquery-ui?
[19:14:58] <clondike> i haven't tried a datepicker in phonegap
[19:15:03] <clondike> i only played with it a bit
[19:15:10] <clondike> draggable in phonegap broke my spirit
[19:17:04] <clondike> there seems to be a lot of references if you google for jquery datepicker phonegap
[19:17:54] <jetsaredim> is there a way to make a jquery widget tab a direct link to a page rather than displaying content on the current page?
[19:18:44] <ryanneufeld> jetsaredim is asking about the jquery-ui tabs
[19:21:23] <jetsaredim> ryanneufeld: nm - figured it out
[19:21:29] <ryanneufeld> share?
[19:21:46] <jetsaredim> http://goo.gl/ITMg3
[19:21:49] <jetsaredim> stack overflow - ftw
[19:22:08] <ryanneufeld> That is one way to do it
[19:22:16] <jetsaredim> works for me
[19:24:24] <scar> if i have a label wrapped around an input, how can i grab the input upon clicking the label?
[19:25:09] <tw2113> $('label').on('click',function(){ });
[19:25:49] <scar> tw2113: yeah i got all that, but i have lots of labels, and want to auto grab the child input without using ids
[19:26:09] <scar> ive used .siblings() for siblings, but i just found .children (was looking for .child first)
[19:26:09] <tw2113> so add an attribute?
[19:26:17] <tw2113> wrap this one in a div that you can be more specific with?
[19:26:59] <tw2113> i wonder if you can target by the "for" attribute
[19:27:11] <scar> tw2113: basically when i click the label and the checkbox gets checked, i want a textbox to appear-- cool. got that, but i want it to disppear when not clicked, so i need to grab the .attr('checked') value of the child input when the label is clicked
[19:27:27] <scar> <label><input type="checkbox" name="orl_cond_add"> ADD/ADHD</label>
[19:27:52] <scar> i can use .change or .click , but if i do .change i can check the value of what the input changed to
[19:27:57] <scar> well, the checked value
[19:28:17] <tw2113> like i said, you just need to find a way to target the specific label
[19:28:55] <scar> i am targeting the specific label-- i have $(document).on("click",".condition-list li label",function(event) {
[19:29:23] <scar> so once clicked i want to grab label's child.. maybe .children('input:first') ? so i dont have to worry if an array comes back?
[19:29:39] <tw2113> $(this).val() ?
[19:29:52] <tw2113> or will there be many checkboxes?
[19:30:18] <scar> just one checkbox in each label
[19:30:53] <jrockjiggz> scar: i just want to say, the <input> should not be nested inside the <label>
[19:31:09] <tw2113> <input type="checkbox" id="orl_cond_add" name="orl_cond_add"><label for="orl_cond_add">ADD/ADHD</label>
[19:31:15] <jrockjiggz> well. i guess it doesn't matter. but the for="" should be a unique ID
[19:31:23] <scar> tw2113: true, but im gonna have lots of checkboxes
[19:31:36] <scar> hmm
[19:31:46] <jrockjiggz> I don't think checkboxes have anything todo with nesting inside your label
[19:31:47] <scar> well, lots of labels-- 1 checkbox each heh
[19:32:00] <scar> well i dont want to have to assign ids etc etc i guess i have to automagically
[19:32:04] <tw2113> should be able to capture the click for 1 label at a time
[19:32:20] <jrockjiggz> <label for="check1">True</label> <input type="checkbox" id="check1"> wouldn't work?
[19:32:36] <tw2113> depends on where he wants the checkbox relative to the label
[19:33:19] <jrockjiggz> scar: i would assign automagically to keep things in order.. the click feature is native to the browser and it wouldn't take much to assign Ids
[19:34:27] <scar> tw2113: http://www.orlandopediatricdentistry.com/portal.htm -- click next to the checkboxes
[19:35:00] <scar> i can get 'test' to appear-- didnt do the disable part, but i wanted to be able to toggle the div html on and off (the .html() on the div will be a textbox)
[19:35:15] <tw2113> those look like radio buttons
[19:35:26] <scar> where?
[19:35:30] <scar> ojh
[19:35:32] <scar> hit continue
[19:35:55] <scar> i just want to somehow toggle-- and so i have to determine-- the console.log() gives me 2 values each run on that code
[19:36:15] <scar> http://pastebin.com/dhvbXZVp
[19:36:17] <scar> on that part
[19:36:23] <scar> it says log once, but it logs twice on 1 click
[19:37:54] <tw2113> where's the js for it?
[19:38:13] <scar> http://www.orlandopediatricdentistry.com/wp-content/themes/orl/js/submit-info.js?ver=3.4.2
[19:38:21] <scar> well hey i just got it to work
[19:38:21] <scar> lol
[19:38:31] <scar> =D
[19:38:41] <scar> i did my method-- but was confused bc i was getting 2 values per click
[19:38:59] <scar> so i said screw it and finished it and it worked anyway-- but is that a 'bad' way to do it? heh
[19:39:20] <tw2113> did it work?
[19:39:32] <tw2113> if(worked) { return 'ok'; }
[19:39:37] <scar> yah :D
[19:40:04] <tw2113> the question is more "is there a more effective way"
[19:40:14] <scar> if (child_value) { $(this).siblings('div').html('my textbox'); } else { $(this).siblings('div').html(''); }
[19:40:40] <codephobic> hello?
[19:40:42] <codephobic> Is it possible to send an object as the "data" property within an ajax function?
[19:41:01] <scar> codelahoma: a serialized object perhaps
[19:41:02] <tw2113> pass it in via the success callback codephobic ?
[19:41:17] <tw2113> or am i thinking in the wrong order
[19:41:34] <codephobic> tw2113, don't get that.
[19:41:36] <shoky> client->server PLX
[19:41:59] <tw2113> are you sending or receiving with this ajax?
[19:42:22] <codephobic> tw2113, I want to pass a javascript object/array/json string to the 'data' property of the server
[19:42:29] <scar> he's sending
[19:42:33] <codephobic> tw2113, sending
[19:42:47] <tw2113> not sure then, i'm more used to receiving with ajax
[19:42:59] <codephobic> tw2113, same here :(
[19:43:22] <scar> codelahoma: are you passing it dynamically?
[19:43:25] <scar> or is it a static object
[19:43:30] <codephobic> I'm trying to streamline a process for a cart I have been making
[19:43:41] <scar> i mean you could serialize the object and place it as a hidden input variable
[19:43:45] <codephobic> scar, is that q directed at me?
[19:43:46] <scar> and send it with wp_localization
[19:43:53] <scar> codephobic yes
[19:43:56] <codephobic> ah, I see
[19:44:29] <codephobic> I'm going to be passing it dynamically
[19:45:04] <codephobic> it's going to be made up of pre-existing object and the fields from a form submission
[19:45:07] <scar> codephobic: problem is you'd have to figure out a way to create what you need within your wp ajax action functions
[19:45:27] <scar> codephobic: well then you could create the object via js and try to pass the actual js object
[19:46:05] <codephobic> at the moment, I'm 'cheating' and saving the object as a json string and passing the form submission variables through ajax ... but I don't feel comfortable with this 'solution' that I've made.
[19:46:50] <shoky> sounds fine, nothing like 'cheating'
[19:47:02] <codephobic> err, I mean I'm saving the object as a json string to a cookie, then getting the cookie in the php script ...
[19:47:11] <shoky> json is more flexible than standard post-data
[19:47:14] <codephobic> it just doesn't seem right to me... too hacked.
[19:47:17] <tw2113> sounds like constructing a variable to pass in
[19:48:03] <shoky> how does using json for exactly what json should be used for .. a hack
[19:48:17] <shoky> does=is
[19:48:59] <tw2113> logic is not defined
[19:49:10] <codephobic> shoky, not the json string part, but the fact that I'm sending some data (the orders) through string > cookie > string > object, and other data through ajax variables.
[19:49:16] <shoky> oh saving the object as json to a cookie indeed sounds hacky
[19:49:21] <codephobic> then reassembling it on the php page.
[19:49:25] <shoky> yea, just caught that part
[19:49:28] <codephobic> exactly
[19:49:30] <codephobic> lol
[19:50:35] <shoky> i like smth like:    data: { myObj: JSON.stringify(myObj) }
[19:50:49] <shoky> no cookies plz
[19:50:50] <codephobic> hmm, that sounds promising.
[19:51:53] <codephobic> but at the php end, I would access it my say json_decode($_POST['myObj']); ?
[19:52:06] <codephobic> by*
[19:52:49] <shoky> think so
[19:53:04] <codephobic> scar, how would you pass a js object to a php page? (I googled, but couldn't find anything on point).
[19:53:06] <shoky> another option is to set  contentType: 'application/json'
[19:53:16] <shoky> and then just:   data: JSON.stringify(obj)
[19:53:31] <shoky> but i have no idea how to deal with that in php
[19:53:35] <shoky> (coz i donno php)
[19:53:55] <codephobic> k, well that's a few really interesting suggestions :)
[19:54:14] <codephobic> btw, contentType isn't a substitute for dataType, is it?
[19:54:18] <shoky> no
[19:54:25] <shoky> contentType is  what you're sending
[19:54:30] <shoky> dataType is what the serve sends back
[19:54:32] <shoky> server
[19:54:41] <codephobic> I had to 'play around' with dataType to get the response to display.
[19:54:58] <shoky> what's the response
[19:55:12] <codephobic> ah, I hadn't actually set a contentType!
[19:55:33] <shoky> you don't need to always, it defaults to regular form urlencoding
[19:55:54] <codephobic> the response was just for testing, I echoed out the variables from the form submission that I'd passed through and I echoed out the cookie ...
[19:56:16] <shoky> well, you could echo out json and set dataType: 'json'  :p
[19:56:40] <shoky> and get a nice fat juicy js object as the success callback argument
[19:57:00] <codephobic> hmm
[19:57:09] <codephobic> I'll go try some of this out
[19:57:35] <codephobic> I was stuck for ideas, but you've given me quite a few, thanks shoky  :)
[19:57:46] <shoky> np ;]
[20:16:13] <munderwo-work> Hi all. I would like to use the IsOpen method on a jqueyr ui dialog as described here http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/#method-isOpen ..
[20:17:03] <munderwo-work> I instansiate my dialog like $('#dialog_id').dialog({*parameters here'}) , but how do I get to the actual dialog object to call IsOpen() on it?
[20:17:24] <Antaranian> hi ladies
[20:17:41] <clondike> i think it's like var thing = $('#dialog_id').dialog({*parameters here'}) and then thing.isOpen() ?
[20:17:44] <munderwo-work> when ever I do $('#dialog_id').dialog() it just returns the DOM element
[20:18:10] <munderwo-work> all I get back from the instansiation is the DOM element..
[20:19:40] <munderwo-work> clondike: yeah I tried that and I get the DOM element returned from the instantsiation
[20:20:37] <clondike> it shouldn't be a dom element
[20:20:42] <clondike> it should be a jquery wrapped set
[20:20:51] <clondike> so you can call hide() and show() and so on
[20:20:58] <clondike> and especially so you can call isOpen()
[20:23:08] <munderwo-work> clondike: http://jsfiddle.net/R9EKH/
[20:23:24] <clondike> apparently this is how you do it http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.ui/1.8.24/themes/blitzer/jquery-ui.css
[20:23:26] <clondike> er
[20:23:31] <clondike> http://jsfiddle.net/pXEzB/
[20:26:11] <munderwo-work> clondike: Thanks... seems a little different from the API. but looks like it works..
[20:29:27] <gowie> Is there a jquery method to check if a given bit of html is a child of a jquery object? Like lets say I have a <ul> with <li>a</li>, <li>b</li>, <li>c</li> is there an easy way to check if $('ul').contains('b')???
[20:29:41] <gowie> Don't know how to phrase that in google...
[20:30:53] <clondike> ?has // maybe?
[20:30:54] <bot-t> .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[20:31:23] <clondike> there is a non-selector option described in the docs
[20:31:45] <clondike> otherwise maybe $(child).closest('ul').length ?
[20:31:59] <clondike> i'm getting pretty sick of your connection, javalover!
[20:32:22] <clondike> sup javalover
[20:32:31] <gowie> clondike Haha he had disconnected at that point
[20:32:42] <gowie> clondike I'll check both of those and see what I can come up with, thanks!
[20:35:12] <clondike> hey javalover
[21:00:07] <Zeu5> hi there
[21:00:31] <Zeu5> is there a way to send both multipart formdata and normal text data in the same ajax request?
[21:01:33] <Zeu5> can anyone see me?
[21:02:04] <tw2113> speak up, i can't hear you Zeu5
[21:02:21] <clondike> IS ANYONE OUT THERE OH GOD PLEASE HELP
[21:02:37] <tw2113> WHY YES I'LL TAKE A CLONDIKE BAR
[21:02:41] <tw2113> THANK YOU VERY MUCH
[21:02:53] <clondike> no Zeu5 i don't think you can send form data via ajax, at least not across browsers
[21:03:31] <Zeu5> hi clondike
[21:03:49] <Zeu5> i can send multipart formdata by writing var data = new FormData()
[21:03:54] <Zeu5> and then inside the $.ajax
[21:04:02] <Zeu5> i set the contentType and processData to false
[21:04:42] <Zeu5> however, it appears that i cannot send text data in the same ajax request alongside with multipart formdata
[21:04:51] <Zeu5> i just want to confirm if this is indeed the case
[21:05:11] <clondike> i am trying to confirm that for you
[21:05:16] <clondike> i don't think it's possible
[21:05:24] <Zeu5> so if i have to send text data
[21:05:30] <Zeu5> and multipart form data through ajax
[21:05:41] <Zeu5> i have to do it sequentially using 2 different ajax request
[21:05:45] <clondike> you could maybe use something like this? https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload
[21:05:50] <Zeu5> after the first one succeeds then i send a second one?
[21:07:44] <Zeu5> i have just finished reading it, clondike
[21:07:49] <clondike> you could do that or you could use a plugin to do it in one
[21:07:59] <Zeu5> i mean scanning teh API of the plugin
[21:08:14] <Zeu5> https://github.com/blueimp/jQuery-File-Upload/wiki/API
[21:08:33] <Zeu5> the plugin appears not to be able to do it in a single request
[21:08:44] <Zeu5> at least it does not explicitly state that it can
[21:08:49] <clondike> then i have wagered all and lost
[21:08:52] <clondike> i am sorry
[21:09:00] <Zeu5> and it seems to be tied to a specific input file type
[21:09:06] <Zeu5> for each ajax request
[21:09:14] <Zeu5> its cool clondike
[21:09:20] <Zeu5> i just wanted to confirm that this was indeed the case
[22:21:01] <axscode> $('select[id^="edit-attributes-"][id!="edit-attributes-12"]').after('<span class="step stepdown step-'+$(this).attr('id')+'">+</span>');  <-- $(this).attr('id') is unknown.. how to achieve this concept?

[23:03:03] <danmichel> Modernizr doesn't seem to be working on IE9 or firefox on windows or os x, because font-face fonts aren't working on those browsers. http://varmag.com/ any ideas? Thanks in advance for any help
[23:04:35] <scar2> does the ajax work diff on a mobile device?
[23:04:57] <tw2113> modernizr wouldn't make them work danmichel
[23:05:16] <danmichel> i see. i also tried htaccess for it
[23:05:23] <scar2> what i created is throwing ajax return errors that i dont get on a desktop
[23:05:30] <danmichel> guess i should go back to normal fonts
[23:05:45] <tw2113> why?
[23:05:56] <tw2113> it's a css thing
[23:06:07] <tw2113> also you have whack classes on your html tag like varboxshadow
[23:06:12] <danmichel> it is tw2113?
[23:06:17] <tw2113> yes
[23:06:40] <danmichel> modernizer makes those classes tw2113
[23:07:07] <tw2113> unless a new version changed how it handles that part, it should be either box-shadow or no-box-shadow
[23:07:33] <tw2113> well, no spaces
[23:07:48] <danmichel> Any idea what i did wrong in the css tw2113? http://pastebin.com/bZGvY85p
[23:08:21] <tw2113> why you're getting "var" in those classes, i do not know
[23:08:54] <danmichel> that sucks. i wouldn't even know where to begin looking for that
[23:09:23] <tw2113> where are you font-face styles declared?
[23:09:36] <tw2113> aha, down below
[23:09:43] <danmichel> <html <?php language_attributes(); ?> xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:og="http://ogp.me/ns#" xmlns:fb="https://www.facebook.com/2008/fbml"> tw2113
[23:11:38] <tw2113> it's struggling to load http://24.varmag.com/wp-content/themes/varmag/fonts/modernmtstd-extendeditalic-webfont.ttf from the looks of it
[23:12:33] <danmichel> it's there though tw2113
[23:12:42] <tw2113> i realize it may be
[23:12:53] <tw2113> but the browser is struggling to get it loaded for whatever reason
[23:13:13] <tw2113> all i see is a spinner graphic for it in the net tab of Firebug
[23:13:14] <danmichel> and then i have add_filter('language_attributes', 'modernizr'); function modernizr($output) {     return $output . ' class="no-js"'; } in functions. might that be what is adding the 'var'?
[23:13:27] <tw2113> very well could be
[23:13:53] <danmichel> i thought i needed no-js for the query conflict
[23:13:58] <danmichel> ill try removing it
[23:14:13] <tw2113> i think that's what hooks modernizr and is where it anchors itself
[23:15:03] <danmichel> nope, removing it didn't seem to fix that
[23:15:23] <tw2113> what part of the page is supposed to have that custom font
[23:16:34] <danmichel> #home_feature h2 is one of them tw2113
[23:18:19] <tw2113> so, "Bai Ling" at the moment
[23:18:49] <danmichel> yesh
[23:19:06] <danmichel> and .entries h2, .entries h2 a, .entries h2 a:visited tw2113
[23:22:57] <tw2113> what css file has your @font-face rules
[23:23:10] <danmichel> that one tw2113
[23:23:14] <danmichel> var-style
[23:24:28] <tw2113> give me a url to one that isn't combined from minification
[23:24:58] <tw2113> http://24.varmag.com/wp-content/themes/varmag/var-style.css ?
[23:25:44] <tw2113> in that one, try putting the @font-face parts at the very top, before you attempt to use them at all
[23:26:05] <danmichel> http://varmag.com/wp-content/themes/varmag/var-style.css tw2113
[23:26:15] <tw2113> as a personal note, i've never found need to use the no-fontface part from modernizr because i've always managed to get font-face to work for browsers, even IE6
[23:26:55] <tw2113> but yeah, try putting those 2 at the very top and regen your minimized file
[23:26:59] <danmichel> yeah, i thought it was gonna work too. i added that to troubleshoot tw2113
[23:27:12] <tw2113> css is top down
[23:27:26] <danmichel> what 2? the no-fontface thing?
[23:27:36] <tw2113> the @font-face {} parts
[23:27:54] <danmichel> ok, brb tw2113. thanks again
[23:28:23] <tw2113> when are you going to make money from this site? So you can hire someone to do this stuff for you :D
[23:31:11] <scar2> is it common for ajax to work on desktop but not a mobile?
[23:31:22] <danmichel> didn't seem to work tw2113
[23:31:24] <scar2> ajax i wrote for another site works for both, but this one doesn... hmm
[23:31:51] <danmichel> tw2113 i hope to be making money from the printed addition of the magazine soon

[23:35:31] <tw2113> reupload the ttf copy of modernmtstd-extendeditalic-webfont.ttf

[23:40:29] <tw2113> it hates you
[23:42:11] <danmichel> i guess so. i was just making sure all the caches were cleared
[23:42:50] <tw2113> i can't help but think the ttf file is corrupt somehow
[23:44:36] <danmichel> i just regenerated the ttf file tw2113
[23:44:50] <danmichel> gonna try turning the caches off
[23:46:39] <tw2113> still struggling
[23:47:03] <danmichel> ok, any change tw2113? just turned them off
[23:47:15] <tw2113> oh, it just showed up
[23:48:06] <danmichel> hmm, wow
[23:48:18] <danmichel> looks like i have to remove fonts from my cdn
[23:48:27] <tw2113> i wonder if the ttf was caught in old cache
[23:48:37] <tw2113> or some strange vortex thing
[23:48:47] <tw2113> are you seeing it too?
[23:49:18] <accesscode> how to count number of items of a select list
[23:49:34] <danmichel> yes, I'm seeing it tw2113
[23:49:42] <danmichel> thanks for helping me troubleshoot
[23:51:56] <hetii> Hello :)
[23:52:30] <hetii> Is there any plugin for Lightbox2 that will display picassa albums ?"?
[23:53:12] <tw2113> i don't see why you couldn't make one easily enough
[23:53:29] <tw2113> find a way to pull the urls for the images and then attach the right rel tags to them
[23:55:30] <hetii> the point is that i don`t plan use static url, just provide username for piccassa space where there are public albums and then display that via lightbox
[23:56:26] <tw2113> it'd still have to go fetch image paths whether you type them in yourself or not
[23:57:10] <tw2113> but my head is thinking manual, you want one pre-built
[23:58:23] <hetii> no, pre-buid just display albums and then his contents
[23:59:27] <tw2113> like i said, pre-built
[23:59:37] <tw2113> one where you provide a user name and the rest is done automatically without you touching
