[04:35:35] <RenjieAbarai> Hi! Can any one help me on this? I have this javascript code here that observes if a specific textarea element is being resized and then calls this function `inner_resize()`. My issue with this code is that, it seems a bit too manual and hack-ish. As you can see on the code https://paste.ofcode.org/JhWrcVAwVzmDhYUtPk4D3K, we handled each browser differently because of issues we've encountered using
[04:35:41] <RenjieAbarai> `MutationObserver`. Is there a more unified way of handling this?
[04:47:29] <Cork> RenjieAbarai: by resize do you mean if the user drags in the resize handle in the field?
[05:33:28] <Woet> RenjieAbarai: there's ##javascript for generic JS questions
[07:49:55] <Paradisee> hello
[07:50:13] <Paradisee> how can i put an event click on a input select?
[07:50:35] <Cork> "input select"?
[07:50:37] <Paradisee> http://dpaste.com/16T8ZA3
[07:50:40] <Cork> meaning what?
[07:50:51] <Paradisee> checkbox sorry
[07:51:00] <Cork> don't use attr for disabled
[07:51:20] <Paradisee> Cork: it is not my code, i just need to make some modifications
[07:51:24] <Cork> it makes the code harder to read and breaks in some browsers
[07:51:39] <Cork> just replace it with .prop('disabled', false/true)
[07:51:48] <Cork> shouldn't affect anything else
[07:52:09] <Paradisee> basically i have a button which creates some components
[07:52:09] <Cork> and to answer your question, checkbox has click events ya
[07:52:17] <Paradisee> and in this component i have an input select
[07:52:37] <Paradisee> since it is generated somehow, i neet do put a click event on it
[07:52:41] <Cork> (but man that code is nasty...)
[07:52:46] <Paradisee> i know
[07:52:59] <Paradisee> and you did not see nothing
[07:53:06] <Cork> it puts click attributes on the element, so expect you have problem if you want to have your own
[07:53:32] <Paradisee> what do you mean
[07:53:38] <Cork> click attributes can only exist once on an element, and tend to not work well with event listeners
[07:53:38] <Paradisee> i need to catch that event
[07:54:07] <Cork> you MIGHT beable to use a delegate event listener on a parent element
[07:54:14] <Cork> unless the foo() kills the event
[07:54:18] <Cork> then your out of luck
[07:54:27] <Paradisee> well, how?
[07:54:31] <Paradisee> i don't know jquery
[07:54:37] <Paradisee> i'm used to angular
[07:55:00] <Paradisee> last time i used jquery i had 15 years old
[07:55:05] <Paradisee> s/had/was
[07:55:06] <Cork> $('parent-selector').on('click', '[name="listFormComponent"]', function() {})
[07:55:08] <Cork> try that
[07:55:31] <Cork> parent-selector should be replaced by a selector matching a parent element
[07:55:47] <Cork> if you go far up enough you won't need to bind it multiple times either
[07:55:59] <Cork> just bind it statically to a parent that isn't replaced
[07:56:22] <Cork> if it doesn't work for that element, the original code can't be extended
[07:58:50] <Paradisee> the server is down right now, can't try :/
[08:16:14] <eoli3n> Hi
[08:16:27] <eoli3n> http://ix.io/1U9A
[08:16:42] <eoli3n> i don't understand why on("click") function is not working
[08:19:18] <eoli3n> https://jsfiddle.net/6h0c8afn/
[08:19:38] <eoli3n> i want to set val "" when click inside input and hide Validate button
[08:22:40] <Cork> eoli3n: as you bind the event handler directly on the element, make sure it is actually found by $()
[08:22:49] <Cork> and also that it isn't replaced between that and the event
[08:22:49] <Paradisee> Cork: it does not work
[08:23:08] <eoli3n> Cork:i don't get what you mean
[08:23:11] <Cork> Paradisee: then the onclick attribute most likely does return false and kills the event
[08:23:21] <Cork> then your out of luck
[08:23:35] <eoli3n> https://jsfiddle.net/6h0c8afn/1/
[08:23:36] <Paradisee> let component = $('[data-component=' + newref + ']')[3];
[08:23:39] <Paradisee> this is the input
[08:23:52] <Cork> eoli3n: $() finds elements that exists in the dom when that line runs
[08:24:03] <Cork> then .on loops that and binds the events
[08:24:18] <Cork> if $() doesn't find the target, .on does nothing so the event handler won't be there
[08:24:34] <Cork> so; make sure the selector finds the target from where you run the code
[08:24:43] <eoli3n> that's my pb
[08:24:46] <eoli3n> it doesnt find it
[08:24:50] <eoli3n> but i dont understand why
[08:24:55] <eoli3n> i change for an id
[08:24:57] <eoli3n> same ...
[08:24:57] <Cork> Paradisee: remember that [] unwraps the jquery object so you only have raw dom functions
[08:25:00] <eoli3n> $("#usermail").on("click", function()
[08:25:19] <Cork> eoli3n: most likely cause the code runs before the element exists
[08:25:29] <eoli3n> ohhhh
[08:25:35] <eoli3n> ok i got what you mean
[08:25:43] <Cork> for example in head without $(function() {})
[08:25:48] <eoli3n> $(document).ready(function(){
[08:25:55] <eoli3n> ?
[08:26:05] <Cork> that is the old long version of the same ya
[08:27:06] <eoli3n> Cork... same -> https://jsfiddle.net/6h0c8afn/2/
[08:27:16] <eoli3n> is that what you mean?
[08:29:27] <eoli3n> my bad, it seems working for input.flexdatalist
[08:29:32] <eoli3n> but not for #usermail
[08:32:17] <Cork> eoli3n: most likely cause you have multiple elements with the same id then
[08:32:24] <eoli3n> it does not work with $(function() {})
[08:32:32] <eoli3n> ok for $(document).ready(function(){
[08:32:36] <eoli3n> ah maybe !!
[08:32:39] <Cork> O_o'
[08:32:51] <Cork> no $(document).ready is the depricated version
[08:33:04] <Cork> so $(function() {}) definitely works if $(document) does
[08:33:29] <eoli3n> oh no sorry , i'm the error :)
[08:34:12] <eoli3n> https://jsfiddle.net/6h0c8afn/3/
[08:34:25] <eoli3n> #usermail still not working, without any double id
[08:35:21] <Cork> donno expect you bind keyup there not click
[08:35:40] <eoli3n> ?
[08:36:03] <Cork> in the link you pasted #usermail is for keyup not click
[08:37:16] <eoli3n> yep forget to save
[08:37:18] <eoli3n> sorry for that
[08:37:49] <eoli3n> https://jsfiddle.net/6h0c8afn/4/
[08:38:22] <eoli3n> line 9 console.log not working on click
[08:38:29] <eoli3n> maybe that's because of flexdatalist ?
[08:39:48] <Cork> to start of html section in jsfiddle is the body of the page
[08:40:08] <Cork> use the resources on the left for links and scripts as else you put them in the page body
[08:40:35] <Cork> that might be the cause of your problem, not sure
[08:42:19] <eoli3n> https://jsfiddle.net/6h0c8afn/5/
[08:42:22] <eoli3n> nop
[08:43:04] <Cork> what does console.log($('#usermail').length) and console.log($('[id="usermail"]').length) give you?
[08:45:14] <eoli3n> 1 and 1
[08:46:43] <Cork> if you run it on the same place as the old code?
[08:46:47] <Cork> (not in the console)
[08:47:04] <eoli3n> that's what i did
[08:47:09] <Cork> weird...
[08:47:16] <Cork> so the event does bind...
[08:47:49] <Cork> well it is a text field so you should use on('focus' instad of click so try that
[08:47:54] <Cork> else, donno
[08:49:06] <eoli3n> not working more :(
[08:49:51] <eoli3n> http://projects.sergiodinislopes.pt/flexdatalist/
[08:49:57] <eoli3n> look at events part
[08:50:03] <eoli3n> maybe i should try something here
[08:50:08] <Cork> ah... it might kill the event
[08:50:12] <eoli3n> i made the first part work with that exemple
[08:50:20] <eoli3n> https://jsfiddle.net/6h0c8afn/6/
[08:50:27] <eoli3n> first part on change works
[08:51:12] <Cork> no, doesn't look like it does anything stupid like that
[08:51:27] <Cork> eoli3n: all i looked for is why the click handler wouldn't work
[08:51:34] <Cork> haven't checked that plugin at all
[08:52:04] <eoli3n> hm ok
[08:52:10] <eoli3n> thx for helping !
[08:52:25] <Cork> np, i'm a bit short on time today so can't deep dive
[08:53:48] <eoli3n> ;)
[09:18:41] <eoli3n> Cork the pb is flexdatalist, when i suppress his js cdn it works
[09:23:27] <Cork> eoli3n: not very surpriced, many form plugins are horrible
[10:09:35] <Paradisee> Cork: http://dpaste.com/1407X1J#line-18
[10:09:42] <Paradisee> that's what i've done
[15:50:32] <snatcher> how can i always get array from .val(), empty or with one/multiple items?
[15:50:48] <robertmaxrees> snatcher you can't.
[15:51:01] <robertmaxrees> different inputs will give you different returns.,
[15:51:15] <robertmaxrees> you COULD build a helper function to do that for you, though :)
[16:07:10] <snatcher> what's the difference between toArray() and get()?
[16:11:33] <snatcher> >.toArray() returns all of the elements in the jQuery set >All of the matched DOM nodes are returned by this call, contained in a standard array
[16:11:36] <snatcher> >Without a parameter, .get() returns an array of all of the elements
[16:12:09] <snatcher> don't understand, what's the point of toArray() while get() does the same?
[16:12:56] <robertmaxrees> they do different things.
[16:13:12] <robertmaxrees> :) make a test case and check it out.
[16:16:14] <snatcher> https://forum.jquery.com/topic/get-vs-toarray-get-index-vs-index there is 10 years old post about it
[16:16:35] <RoseBus> hello, for some reason when using .clone() on my form fields, all are incrementing except for my Tempus Dominus widget
[16:16:51] <RoseBus> here is the code I'm using: https://bpaste.net/show/24AH
[16:17:54] <RoseBus> here's what the html looks like
[16:17:55] <RoseBus> https://bpaste.net/show/5ni5
[16:19:07] <RoseBus> i expect the id to increment: so... id_form-1-time_start_video_file... id_form-2..., id_form-3...., as do all the other inputs
[16:19:16] <RoseBus> but for some reason this one input is not incrementing
[16:19:51] <RoseBus> so when i use dynamic forms and i click that widget on a second or third form, it's actually selecting the first form's widget every time
[16:20:57] <RoseBus> forgive me i'm extremely new to JS... i work mostly with python but I've been putting together this django project and now i've come face-to-face with js
[16:36:01] <royalty> you know in order to get total forms you can literally just count form elements on the page
[16:36:09] <royalty> RoseBus
[16:37:14] <royalty> also try getting everything into a neat jsfiddle to play around with
[16:37:20] <royalty> rather than showing a few code snippets
[16:37:23] <RoseBus> royalty, yes your majesty
[16:37:38] <royalty> XD
[16:38:22] <RoseBus> okay i can count with my fingers but not with js, this code is copied & pasted from stack exchange
[16:38:36] <RoseBus> lol
[16:39:01] <RoseBus> i'm looking into a similar issue: https://github.com/tempusdominus/bootstrap-4/issues/207
[16:39:17] <RoseBus> and i'm trying to incorporate his solution in my own code... which is hard bc i didn't write my own code
[16:39:27] <RoseBus> _but_ i guess i'm learning a little
[17:02:05] <RoseBus> royalty, I updated the addForm() funciton to include .datetimepicker and it also will update the data-target attr for each additional form: https://bpaste.net/show/RUnA
[17:02:19] <RoseBus> however, when clicking on the new elements, they still seem to be pointing to just the first one created
[20:22:41] <shoukran> Is there an error with how I am loading jquery? My javascript files are not running in production. https://dpaste.de/oJdm
[20:41:36] <pavonia> What mean "not running" here?
[20:41:39] <pavonia> *means
[21:11:03] <shoukran> does anyone have experience with geoplugin
[21:11:52] <robertmaxrees> shoukran what's your question?
[21:13:02] <shoukran> robertmaxrees ive been using it on my local server and it works, but on production i get the error, Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT. Is this because my production server uses https and i need their ssl activation key for that https://www.geoplugin.com/premium#ssl_access_per_year? Don't want to spend the money if it doesn't en
[21:13:02] <shoukran> d up fixing the issue
[21:16:05] <robertmaxrees> any chance you hit the lookups per minute limitation?
[21:16:22] <shoukran> i dont believe so, i took a break and came back and still not working
[21:16:29] <shoukran> even got my domain verified on their service
[21:16:37] <robertmaxrees> without seeing the issue, it's hard to know.
[21:16:41] <shoukran> do you know if it should still work the same over https or if it requires their key
[21:16:59] <robertmaxrees> can you share your site?
[21:17:07] <robertmaxrees> and you likely can't.
[21:17:13] <robertmaxrees> but that may not be the issue here
[21:17:14] <shoukran> im not sure of the issue either, all i get is the console error of Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_TIMED_OUT that points to my <script language="JavaScript" src="https://www.geoplugin.net/javascript.gp" type="text/javascript"></script>
[21:17:18] <robertmaxrees> you would get a security problem.
[21:18:03] <robertmaxrees> heh - try hitting that url in your browser.
[21:18:10] <robertmaxrees> if works with http but not https.
[21:18:20] <robertmaxrees> sounds like that might be causing your issue.
[21:18:45] <shoukran> i just changed the link to https, but it was http before and still didnt work
[21:18:56] <robertmaxrees> http works fine here.
[21:19:03] <robertmaxrees> http://www.geoplugin.net/javascript.gp
[21:19:07] <shoukran> the issue is it runs on http://127.0.0.1:8000, but not https://www.mydomain.com
[21:19:28] <shoukran> so I was wondering if it is because my server on https://www.mydomain.com doesnt work with geo since the domain has ssl
[21:19:51] <robertmaxrees> nothing on the internet says either way but that might be a reasonable guess.
[21:19:56] <robertmaxrees> why not contact them and ask?
[21:20:22] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, you can proxy through your own server and bypass this issue entirely.
[21:20:29] <shoukran> i did just thought i would ask here in the meantime
[21:20:44] <robertmaxrees> kik
[21:20:46] <robertmaxrees> *lol
[21:22:58] <robertmaxrees> fwiw shotgunning your question out to multiple channels is kinda frowned upon ;)
[21:24:24] <shoukran> was just panicking and trying to get a quick answer, noted tho
[21:24:36] <robertmaxrees> heh
[21:28:09] <shoukran> From what I'm gathering from this, purchasing the ssl key just means you can use their ssl url. I think it should still work on any domain name for websites tho, hmm not sure why im seeing that error. Hopefully they dont take too long to get in contact
[21:28:24] <robertmaxrees> erm
[21:28:31] <robertmaxrees> lol
[21:28:35] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating things.
[21:28:49] <robertmaxrees> you won't be able to use it on your site regardless because your site is on https
[21:30:17] <shoukran> so is the issue that my site is https and i am linking an http source
[21:30:24] <robertmaxrees> no.
[21:30:28] <robertmaxrees> you're mixing things up.
[21:30:29] <shoukran> i am so confused lol
[21:30:49] <robertmaxrees> you cannot call an HTTP resource from an HTTPS page.
[21:31:02] <shoukran> thats what i said aha
[21:31:04] <robertmaxrees> also, that service does not allow you to call the HTTPS resource without a special key.
[21:31:09] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you said.
[21:31:17] <robertmaxrees> and the links you provided are for https
[21:31:22] <shoukran> my site (page) is https and i am linking an http source (calling an http resource)
[21:31:33] <robertmaxrees> your examples from earlier are not https
[21:31:39] <robertmaxrees> err, are not http
[21:31:45] <robertmaxrees> as in, your examples are https
[21:31:59] <shoukran> i fixed that, i was just seeing if it would work if it was https. i now use http://www.geoplugin.net/javascript.gp
[21:32:09] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you can't do that.
[21:32:15] <robertmaxrees> browser blocks it.
[21:32:21] <shoukran> okay makes sense
[21:32:43] <shoukran> ill purchase the ssl key then, just wanted to make sure it would solve the issue before paying :)
[21:32:50] <robertmaxrees> it may or may not.
[21:32:55] <robertmaxrees> slow down and wait for a response.
[21:33:10] <robertmaxrees> nowhere does it say that it'll flat out timeout without that key.
[21:33:26] <shoukran> kk
