[01:25:59] <hubcaps> Hello, is there a way I can use the text of a clicked link within a jquery .load() as a url parameter?
[01:27:37] <jphase> hubcaps: that question is a tad too vague since .load() has a couple of purposes, and I'm not totally certain what you mean by "text of a clicked link as a url parameter"
[01:27:51] <jphase> can you elaborate a little bit?
[01:34:12] <hubcaps> Something like this jphase
[01:34:14] <hubcaps> http://jsbin.com/mosujefovo/edit?html,output
[01:36:29] <hubcaps> Just a kind of mockup of what I'm trying to achieve, where the text of the link that is being clicked then becomes a URL parameter. Basically I've got a backend python function to give a lsit of directories, these are then presented in the html, I want to be able to have the text, which is the name of the directory in my case, be passed to the load function so I can then show directories under that one,
[01:36:31] <hubcaps> kicking off my backend python with the passed directory name
[01:38:36] <hubcaps> syntax in mockup is jacked btw, forgive me lol
[01:39:15] <jphase> hubcaps: it sounds like you might want to look into either decodeURIComponent() or using new URL('http://string.of.url/?some=param') type of thing
[01:39:46] <jphase> based on .load perhaps you might want to create a new JS URL object from the return
[01:39:51] <jphase> uncertain
[01:40:42] <hubcaps> I'll look into those suggestions, thank you jphase

[03:42:20] <arunkumar413_> I'm trying to concatenate strings. Please let me know if this is a valid code. If not please suggest the changes required
[03:42:22] <arunkumar413_> https://gist.github.com/arunkumar413/3d4b41d22e1241f752e611b6070f6020
[03:44:43] <pavonia> You can't use if-statements as an expression, AFAIK
[03:52:30] <arunkumar413_> pavonia: how to concatenate two strings based on if else condition. The second operand is the outcome of if else operation
[03:54:22] <pavonia> Two options: a) if (...) { c = c + ... }, b) c + c (condition ? truePart : falsePart)
[03:55:23] <pavonia> The important thing is that if-statements execute things, thex don't return a value
[03:56:10] <pavonia> While (cond ? expr1 : expr2) can be used in expression context
[03:57:06] <pavonia> This is offtopic, btw, would be more appropriate in ##javascript
[03:58:17] <arunkumar413_> may be I should call a function for the second operand to return the value
[03:58:41] <arunkumar413_> c = c+func();
[04:01:07] <pavonia> Why? Just put the assignment in the branches of if
[04:04:00] <arunkumar413_> yeah sounds good
[06:22:17] <neo_> hi guys!
[06:22:47] <neo_> I've made my first task on freelancer.com and got 15$ , is it possible earn there 3 000 $ per month ?
[06:24:18] <neo_> who can pass instead me on freelancer.com English test ?

[06:25:41] <neo_> pavonia, I want find guy who native English who can pass test instead me , any test there cost 5$
[06:25:56] <neo_> pavonia, do you think it's good idea ?
[06:26:18] <neo_> pavonia, I really don't know how got clients there who will pay much money me
[06:26:31] <pavonia> Not sure I understand your aim
[06:27:13] <neo_> pavonia, aim earn on freelancer.com 2 000 - 3 000 $ per month , I would be rich in Ukraine on this money
[06:27:33] <neo_> pavonia, How can I do this ? is it possibly earn there 3000$ ?
[06:27:54] <neo_> pavonia, :)
[06:28:06] <neo_> pavonia, babe what do you think possibly or not ?
[06:28:10] <pavonia> If you solve enough taks, why not
[06:28:43] <neo_> pavonia, it's not depends on amount of task, need do expensive task
[06:29:36] <neo_> pavonia, each task take time and need right estimate each task , if I made many task which take many hours for 15$ I earn nothing
[06:30:07] <neo_> pavonia, Need got clients from USA or western Europe who have money , How I can get them ?
[06:30:43] <pavonia> I don't know
[06:30:52] <neo_> pavonia, or you think use other strategy doing hard task for nothing and got experience ?
[06:31:11] <neo_> pavonia, babe let's think together ;)
[06:31:31] <neo_> pavonia, can use differ tactics
[06:32:27] <neo_> pavonia, make cheap tasks and got experience, than you get more experience you stay more sure and can do more expansive tasks ?
[06:33:07] <neo_> pavonia, or instantly trying got expensive task and don't do cheap task , but you can't got experience .....
[06:33:28] <neo_> pavonia, I don't know which use, need to be flexible .... ?
[06:33:36] <pavonia> Please stop highlighting me
[06:33:44] <neo_> pavonia, )))
[06:33:52] <pavonia> Also, this is offtopic
[06:33:53] <neo_> pavonia, I want tempt you )))
[06:34:27] <pavonia> I'm ignoring you now
[06:35:07] <neo_> pavonia, it was joke , sorry, I will not obsessive to you , just I need advise little )
[06:35:31] <neo_> choose right strategy
[06:36:06] <neo_> pavonia, :)
[06:36:36] <neo_> pavonia, want me to give you interesting video ... wait ...
[06:38:02] <neo_> pavonia, see this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrzAUlHgTsM
[06:38:59] <fearnothing> hi folks, I am a bit new to jquery so I'm not entirely sure what search terms to use... hoping if I describe my issue someone can at least tell me what I need to google for reading material :)
[06:39:28] <neo_> pavonia, this busness model sound good , but it's not suited for me , I from one east European country where he offer find student's for 100$ doing tasks
[06:39:58] <fearnothing> I have a table in which every alternate row is hidden. The row above it contains a button which I want to click to toggle show/hide of the hidden one
[06:40:37] <neo_> pavonia, he offer seek clients for 1000$ tasks and sell this task executors from east Europe for 100$ and all to be happy . And you can earn 8 000 $ per month
[06:41:04] <fearnothing> what I'm not sure about right now is what the best way to reference the show/hide row in that button
[06:41:06] <neo_> this is interestingly offer, but need perfect English , and I have not
[06:42:14] <neo_> fearnothing, you need use relative path relative this button which you click
[06:42:32] <pavonia> You could give it a data-something property which corresponds to the row id
[06:42:48] <neo_> fearnothing, it depends on HTML structure
[06:43:08] <neo_> pavonia, or parent element )
[06:43:34] <fearnothing> hmm possible, I have an EventRecordID property which is going to be unique for each row
[06:43:43] <neo_> pavonia, he can use .parent().parent() and than find that row use find('selector')
[06:44:07] <fearnothing> so I could put that into the id for the row that I want to be shown/hidden
[06:44:17] <neo_> fearnothing yes or like offered pavonia, use id
[06:44:21] <fearnothing> because each pair of rows will be generated in the same iteration
[06:45:06] <neo_> fearnothing , can add for button data , data-id='name_row' and when you click on button get that id from button
[06:45:30] <neo_> pavonia, ;)
[06:45:50] <neo_> pavonia, are you from Ukraine or Russia ?
[06:46:03] <neo_> pavonia, Ты откуда?
[06:46:10] <fearnothing> do you mean <button data-id="name_row">Click Me</button> ?
[06:46:38] <neo_> fearnithing, yes exactly
[06:47:01] <neo_> fearnothing, you everything know and still ask us ...
[06:48:00] <fearnothing> haha, no, I had never encountered the idea of using data-id property in HTML element before, you just explain it well :P
[06:49:00] <neo_> fearnothing, use $('button').click(function(){var data=$(this).data('name_row'); $(data).css('dispay','block');});
[06:49:18] <neo_> fearnothing, something like that
[06:50:02] <fearnothing> wait, so 'name_row' isn't the unique ID?
[06:50:07] <neo_> I used recent display block or inline-block
[06:50:49] <neo_> fearnothing, you nee that alter on your real unique ID . Yes this is unique ID
[06:51:15] <neo_> fearnothing, ID must to be always unique
[06:51:59] <neo_> its id and it's imply unique
[06:52:54] <neo_> fearnothing, for good know jQuery need good know CSS , jQuery and CSS working together , learn both
[06:53:31] <neo_> pavonia, :)
[07:03:06] <fearnothing> neo_ yeah I know, I mostly do back end stuff
[07:03:22] <fearnothing> ok so, here's what I have right now
[07:03:26] <fearnothing> https://jsfiddle.net/x43jb352/5/
[07:04:12] <fearnothing> the intent is that clicking the 'Detail' button toggles the display-none class on the tr with the corresponding id
[07:05:07] <neo_> in my browser nothing happens
[07:05:24] <fearnothing> exactly, and i think that's because in my jquery I've gotten the referencing wrong
[07:05:36] <neo_> maybe
[07:06:38] <fearnothing> what's the easy way to show what value a given variable has? normally I just dump things to console at various points in my program until I find which values are getting set incorrectly
[07:06:46] <fearnothing> but idk how to do that in javascript
[07:07:00] <fearnothing> at least, not in browser js :) easy to do in nodejs
[07:17:49] <pavonia> fearnothing: What does the second parameter in $('button.detailbtn', $detail) do?
[07:20:25] <pavonia> If you can't log to console, you could pop up alerts at some places
[07:21:00] <pavonia> or put an extra div on the site temporarily where you log messages
[07:21:47] <john02> hi. how can i add a "transition: all 1s ease 1s" to this so when the whole color of the page changes, it goes with a color transition>>> $('#change-color').on('click', function () {         $('link').attr('href','css/style-night.css');      });
[07:23:44] <pavonia> fearnothing: https://jsfiddle.net/x43jb352/7/
[07:24:32] <john02> code is here: jsbin.com/bubalomake/1/edit?js
[07:39:44] <neo_> pavonia, hey , do you good know English ? pass for me test ... , I need got high score ...
[07:40:51] <neo_> pavonia, my skype kselax , add me I share screen and will pass test together :) , you will say me right answer ))
[07:41:03] <neo_> pavonia, do you have skype ?
[07:43:01] <neo_> pavonia, :)
[07:50:44] <fearnothing> pavonia - thank you, I couldn't find anything that would tell me what the second variable in a selector was for
[07:51:10] <fearnothing> I suspected that might have something to do with it, but I got that code from somewhere else a while back and didn't want to play with it too much until I found out what it did
[07:52:27] <pavonia> There were also missing braces in your code
[07:56:51] <fearnothing> ah yeah I found those after pasting it, forgot to update for you
[07:57:26] <fearnothing> it's because there are other jquery functions that I omitted to make it easier to read
[07:57:40] <fearnothing> forgot to put in the closing braces after copying
[07:59:50] <fearnothing> hrm, that only seems to work when there is a single row
[08:00:07] <fearnothing> when there are multiple rows, it doesn't toggle the class anymore
[08:00:39] <fearnothing> clicking the button still seems to -set- the class, but not unset
[08:17:41] <fearnothing> and if I do toggleClass("display-none", false); it unsets the class, but does not set
[11:36:06] <lemonsparrow> is there a better way to write this ?
[11:36:06] <lemonsparrow> $( "#dropdown" ).change(function() {   $("#description").append(this.value == "None" ? "" : this.value); });
[11:37:38] <nikio_> what is a nice way to dynamically put together complex bootstrap views... using append, find etc quickly makes for ugly and hard to follow code
[11:37:40] <nikio_> ?
[12:40:44] <neo_> hi guys , what happened with my site ? http://kselax.ru/
