[00:01:35] <dr0id> I experienced some visual bug in chrome 16
[00:01:41] <dr0id> it wasn't there in 15
[00:02:00] <dr0id> with css3 transition (background colors)
[00:02:26] <dogarrhea2> hmm. it appears to be a chrome bug. i am not getting any visual errors in IE9
[00:02:39] <dogarrhea2> or firefox
[00:02:41] <edgardo> well, chrome isn't known for it's superior css3 effect rendering :)
[00:03:19] <dogarrhea2> i'm not even using css3.. i'm just dragging a ui draggable around the document over some other elements with lower z value
[00:03:36] <dogarrhea2> the alpha value parts of the ui draggable are smearing the other images around
[00:04:05] <edgardo> isn't draggable using css3 transition ?
[00:04:17] <dogarrhea2> is it? i don't know
[00:08:18] <edgardo> I'm under the impression that it does, remember reading about it somewhere.. but you know.. internet is full of bullcrap so you can never be 100% sure :9
[00:09:37] <dogarrhea2> hmm.
[00:09:44] <dogarrhea2> o well i'll just live with the stupid chrome bug.
[00:09:58] <dogarrhea2> people who are using chrome will update it anyways so i'm not too worried . it's just a matter of time
[00:10:30] <dogarrhea2> is there a way to get the dx (the change in x) of a draggable each time the event is triggered?
[00:12:03] <dogarrhea2> i see one way of doing it:  making a global variable keep track of the last drag event and finding out where the X was..
[00:26:07] <jessepinho> Hi all. How do I programmatically click a submit button on a form? I know I can use trigger('click') or just click(), but that doesn't seem to also execute the default functionality of the button.
[00:26:08] <jessepinho> '
[00:26:58] <roflbbq> Is there any way to force .children() to go recursive, on a depth limitation ? pretty much this: http://jsfiddle.net/LQHsY/
[00:29:29] <roflbbq> should have said « any __buil-in__ way» ofc
[00:29:30] <jessepinho> roflbbq: use find()
[00:29:47] <jessepinho> roflbbq: although I don't know how to do a depth limitation...
[00:29:51] <jessepinho> find?
[00:29:57] <roflbbq> yeah
[00:29:57] <jessepinho> Oh, not bot here I guess...
[00:29:59] <roflbbq> thanks
[00:30:13] <dr0id> ?find
[00:30:14] <bot-t> .find(selector): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[00:30:54] <jessepinho> Anyone know how to trigger the native DOM behavior for an element?
[00:31:03] <jessepinho> i.e., submit a form when a button is clicked?
[00:32:36] <roflbbq> there is document.forms['lulz'].submit()
[00:33:09] <roflbbq> so just get back your form DOM element from the click hook and use .submit()
[00:37:29] <dogarrhea2> ok. figured it out. need to use "stop" on ui draggable to find dx of dragged distance
[00:51:08] <yamahaalex> is it bad to make my gameLoop update every ms
[01:03:44] <nveid> whats that website where you can test javascript code?
[01:04:00] <edgardo> www.jsfiddle.net ?
[01:04:17] <nveid> thanx
[01:10:02] <yamahaalex> is it possible to check if a number is within a range
[01:10:26] <yamahaalex> like if int > 10  && < 20
[01:10:33] <yamahaalex> but i also have other
[01:10:41] <yamahaalex> && statements in that if
[01:11:06] <edgardo> if (var > 10 && var < 20) { .....
[01:11:16] <Kichael> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/870507/determining-if-a-variable-is-within-range-ruby
[01:11:26] <yamahaalex> hold on i dont know how to put this
[01:11:35] <yamahaalex> i need to say if this and this and this or this
[01:11:52] <Kichael> case statement?
[01:11:53] <yamahaalex> but i dont want the || to cancel all the ands, do you know what i mean
[01:12:05] <yamahaalex> i only want the very last part to be an OR
[01:12:16] <Kichael> check the link..
[01:12:23] <yamahaalex> so basically if (this and this and (THIS OR THIS))
[01:12:54] <Kichael> if ((1..10) === i) || i == 28)
[01:13:47] <yamahaalex> so .. should do it
[01:13:57] <yamahaalex> because then i can just have if this and this and this
[01:14:03] <Kichael> woops, thought this was the ruby channal
[01:14:04] <Kichael> my bad
[01:14:06] <yamahaalex> oh shit
[01:14:07] <yamahaalex> lol
[01:14:08] <yamahaalex> np
[01:14:33] <edgardo> I looked at the link and thought they were universal :)
[01:14:35] <yamahaalex> so can i do this, and have these brackets make the OR statement keep the AND valid
[01:14:37] <yamahaalex> (this and this and (THIS OR THIS))
[01:14:56] <yamahaalex> so i dont want the final OR statement to cancel at the first 2 and
[01:15:12] <edgardo> can you give a practical example?
[01:15:14] <yamahaalex> the first 2 and must be true first, then the or
[01:15:16] <yamahaalex> yes
[01:15:25] <edgardo> with all thise this's I can't keep track what you mean :)
[01:15:30] <edgardo> those*
[01:15:32] <Kichael> write a between function
[01:15:33] <yamahaalex> haha yeah hold on practical example

[01:16:06] <yamahaalex> its basically if player is within a buildings x bounds, and between 0 and 20 from the floor
[01:16:59] <yamahaalex> if (xPos > xLeft AND xPos < xRight and (yPos > 0 or yPos < 10)
[01:17:22] <yamahaalex> wait i need to rethink this......
[01:27:32] <yamahaalex> just for an update, and thanks for helping me
[01:27:41] <yamahaalex> turns out i only needed and statements anyway
[01:27:42] <yamahaalex> if (posPlayer[0] >= walls[i][0] && posPlayer[0] <= walls[i][2] && posPlayer[1] + 20 >= walls[i][1] - 10 && posPlayer[1] + 20 >= walls[i][1]){
[01:28:44] <yamahaalex> ah darn, this "fix" broke something else
[01:28:49] <yamahaalex> ill show you what i was trying to fix
[01:28:54] <yamahaalex> http://jsfiddle.net/74dE5/1/
[01:29:11] <yamahaalex> when you hit the floor and press up , you fly thru the floor
[01:30:58] <yamahaalex> the reason is, my gravity is -= 10, and the collide statement says if player Y = floor... so when you jump +1, you fall 10, missing the floor collide
[01:36:05] <nveid> you can have as many && || statements as you want
[01:36:36] <yamahaalex> you see my problem
[01:36:36] <yamahaalex> http://jsfiddle.net/74dE5/1/
[01:36:45] * nveid checks it out
[01:36:57] <yamahaalex> if the player presses up, he goes 1 above the floor, gravity falls -= 10, therefore he goes thru the floor
[01:37:52] <nveid> whoo nifty, ur making a game
[01:38:00] <yamahaalex> haha
[01:38:14] <yamahaalex> yeah i am excited for the future of html/js, and games
[01:38:33] <yamahaalex> tf2 in webgl looks promissing
[01:38:50] <nveid> I haven't got into web game development yet
[01:39:45] <yamahaalex> im new to it, but ive been into game dev for a bit
[01:40:56] <yamahaalex> run www.justmakegames.com, want to feature more indie and web game stuff
[01:41:23] <nveid> plus.. My mind is thinking geodetry right now, so can't really read to help you right now.. 4:40 am here
[01:41:26] <yamahaalex> i like that you can do any OS and any mobile with html5
[01:41:30] <yamahaalex> no prob
[01:41:32] <nveid> isn't thinking geometrically even
[01:41:38] <yamahaalex> haha
[01:42:27] <nveid> Been busy working on a super keel Safari Extension, so I can keep on top of my hosting support tickets & websites live chats.. without having togoto the webpages
[01:42:31] <roflbbq> yamahaalex, on case 87, if (posPlayer[1] > 0){posPlayer[1] -= 10;} and there you go
[01:42:45] <roflbbq> you can call it a workaround tho
[01:43:03] <yamahaalex> that and i would need to temporarily stop gravity roflbbq
[01:43:35] <nveid> Many days moons ago, I wrote an entire space simulation in a text based game
[01:44:20] <nveid> though that was in C, and that was for something called a MUSH(like a MUD).. Things most people know nothing about these days.

[02:36:18] <chee> you're a surrealist, i'm a normal guy
[02:57:40] <aravind_> Hi there. $('input#username').attr('value'); or $('input#username').val(); or $('input[name=username]').attr('value'); or $('input[name=username]').val(); returns only Username
[02:57:46] <aravind_> why is that?
[02:59:31] <JackBauer24> aravind_: if "Username" is a value of your #username field, then it is intended behaviour
[02:59:56] <aravind_> No. I've entered some text in the #username input field
[03:04:06] <JackBauer24> aravind_: remove a space before "#username"
[03:04:34] <JackBauer24> aravind_: sorry, I thought there was a space
[03:05:17] <JackBauer24> aravind_: maybe you got a typo in your HTML code, here is the working example: http://jsfiddle.net/TAjhB/

[03:54:40] <melkornemesis> how can i include it?
[03:55:44] <JackBauer24> melkornemesis: you can select the parent element of your table
[03:56:01] <JackBauer24> or simply prepend and append open and close table tags
[03:56:45] <melkornemesis> JackBauer24: parent() will do the job, thanks
[03:56:45] <melkornemesis> i cant prepend and append tags, because there are some classes i dont know about

[05:38:54] <Rotham_> how do I attach a keyup event to an object so it will only execute once?
[05:39:13] <Segaja> Rotham_: in the eventlistener function remove the eventlistener
[05:39:30] <Segaja> so if the function is called the first time the listener will be removed
[05:40:03] <Rotham_> whats the function name for removing an event listener?
[05:40:27] <Rotham_> ah nm found it
[05:40:29] <Rotham_> .off
[05:40:58] <Segaja> unbind() maybe
[05:41:06] <Segaja> of off()
[05:41:34] <Rotham_> ah yeah
[05:50:12] <aple> When I'm using AJAX like so:    $.ajax({ url: 'ajax.php', data: 'task=' + task });    is it basically just passing that data to ajax.php, then ONLY getting back $task?
[05:50:29] <aple> Or does it pass that data to PHP, then retrieve EVERYTHING back?
[05:50:49] <aple> So... if ajax.php had a bajillion vars, would index.php get those back?
[05:51:00] <aple> Or would it just get $task back since that's all I passed?
[05:51:12] <aple> (sorry to be verbose, I'm just having trouble articulating my question)  ;)
[05:54:39] <bartmax> aple: you send task data and receive everything php returns but not internal php variables.
[05:55:19] <bartmax> aple: if you call the php alone, everything that is shown on the browsers is sent back to the ajax request.
[06:00:26] <aple> bartmax: Thanks. So what internal vars are you talking about exactly?
[06:01:26] <bartmax> <?php $interal = 'this is internal'; echo "{public: 'this is public';}" ?>
[06:02:23] <aple> Ah, ok, cool, gotcha. :)
[06:03:08] <aple> So, how do I access public data returned? For instance, how do I specify/access the "data" property in index.php?
[06:03:22] <aple> I've seen serialize or something similar to it, but isn't that.... too much?
[06:03:30] <aple> What if I just wanted to get 2 or 3 things back/
[06:04:00] <ssj> ssup roomies :)
[06:05:18] <ssj> whats the issie aple?
[06:05:23] <ssj> issue*
[06:05:51] <aple> ssj: Well, I'm just curious how to pass/access data back and forth with the "data" property really.
[06:06:17] <sweetgrass> hi folks. I am trying to grab all h3 elements within a specific div and turn those h3 elements into list items within an unordered list.
[06:06:17] <aple> That is... with more than one var
[06:06:30] <ssj> can u explain a bit more?
[06:06:56] <aple> For instance:    $.ajax({ url: 'ajax.php', data: 'task=' + task });    works fine, but what if I wanted to fetch a  $time  variable from ajax.php as well?
[06:07:33] <aple> $.ajax({ url: 'ajax.php', data: 'task=' + task + '&time' + time });    ?????
[06:07:36] <ssj> $.ajax({ url: 'ajax.php', data: 'task=' + task +'&time='+time});
[06:07:52] <ssj> yup thats it aple
[06:08:04] <ssj> wait aple
[06:08:08] <ssj> u miss the =
[06:08:28] <ssj> i used a few backs only :)
[06:08:52] <ssj> used it a few weeks back*
[06:09:07] <ssj> took me quite sum time to get started but was easy afterwards :)
[06:10:11] <ssj> to return a array from the php u might want to use json_encode($array);
[06:10:34] <ssj> and use $.each to loop thru it
[06:10:48] <ssj> and make sure the dataType is set to json :)
[06:11:05] <ssj> i had sum problems at that point
[06:11:25] <ssj> the encoded array was considered a string
[06:11:29] <ssj> so cudnt loop thru it
[06:12:08] <ssj> JSON.parse(jsonstring);
[06:12:16] <ssj> i used that instead of mentioning type
[06:13:08] <ssj> aple ya still alive ? :v
[06:13:47] <aple> Yeah I'm bouncing around ;)
[06:14:00] <ssj> :o
[06:14:11] <ssj> =-O
[06:14:20] <ssj> ohk so thats how its done
[06:14:41] <aple> Ah, okay, I see.
[06:14:59] <aple> Where did I miss the  =  ?
[06:15:20] <ssj> (7:37:37 PM) aple: $.ajax({ url: 'ajax.php', data: 'task=' + task + '&time' + time });    ?????
[06:17:19] * ssj bored to death x(
[06:21:04] <ssj> aple which browser?
[06:21:04] <ssj> have u used this in IE ?
[06:21:04] <ssj> coz mine wasnt working in IE and still isnt :/
[06:26:31] <aple> FF
[06:26:47] <aple> Oh, yeah I see where I missed the = :)
[06:32:09] <aple> ssj: lol, I hate AJAX. Keep "fixing it" and "figuring it out" then BOOM it all breaks and I'm clueless.
[06:38:28] <helpcrypto> hi
[06:39:12] <varnie> hello!
[06:39:13] <helpcrypto> i have been googling a bit, and ill like to know if its possible/"not unuspported" to do a POST request to an url containing GET info
[06:39:39] <helpcrypto> something like $.post(...url: index.php?var=value...
[06:40:04] <varnie> what's the proper way to set html/text to <span> ?
[06:40:25] <helpcrypto> varnie: .html("") ?
[06:40:41] <varnie> maybe I misuse it, but it doesn't set text for me
[06:41:00] <varnie> here's my try: $('p .my-rate span:first').html('abc')
[06:41:54] <helpcrypto> varnie...try a simpler example on jsfiddle and show us
[06:42:17] <varnie> okay, I have to check out whether or not my html structure is correct.
[06:43:50] <ssj> helpcrypto why u want to do that?
[06:44:43] <varnie> here is my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/f5u5B/8/
[06:45:07] <helpcrypto> ssj: post for data, get for view
[06:45:25] <varnie> that span value doesn't change
[06:45:43] <ssj> umm helpcrypto the first param is url
[06:45:55] <ssj> and then after it u can specifify the data
[06:46:43] <ssj>  $.post(url, { 'var': value },....
[06:47:38] <ssj> $.post('index.php', { 'var': value },....
[06:47:41] <ssj> shud that do it ?
[06:47:46] <helpcrypto> not at all
[06:47:52] <helpcrypto> thats a post
[06:47:55] <helpcrypto> or a get
[06:48:04] <helpcrypto> depending of type
[06:48:19] <ssj> what u want to do exactly?
[06:48:35] <helpcrypto> $.ajax('index.php?var=valuie', type:post, { 'var': value },....
[06:49:08] <helpcrypto> if i receive a post->user requesting data
[06:49:18] <helpcrypto> if i receive a get->user requesting view
[06:49:51] <helpcrypto> first should return json, 2nd text
[06:51:08] <ssj> how do u decide if its a post or get ?
[06:51:56] <helpcrypto> ...i dont decide, client request usiong type:post, but url index?var=value (thats get)
[06:51:57] <helpcrypto> right?
[06:52:09] <varnie> is the following code correct? $.('p .my-rate span').append('test me');
[06:52:48] <ssj> its correct if its working varnie:P
[06:53:20] <helpcrypto> varnie: http://jsfiddle.net/f5u5B/17/
[06:53:49] <ssj> with append old data is maintained

[07:37:07] <peterschmidler> Hello. Can anyone help me to figure out why the jQuery call inside the .bind does not work in this example: https://gist.github.com/1490510
[07:39:23] <Grom> what is uploader
[07:40:56] <peterschmidler> Grom: Pluploader
[07:41:29] <peterschmidler> Chrome gives me an Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'keyup' of null ...
[07:44:38] <Grom> peterschmidler, show the call stack of the error
[07:50:12] <Leka> how do i use jQuery to .load any clicked "a" element, and load it's "href" attribute?
[07:50:19] <Leka> this is what i got so far; without working: http://jsfiddle.net/96axR/
[07:51:55] <Leka> oh, missed something in that jsfiddle, this is how it was: http://jsfiddle.net/96axR/1/
[07:52:16] <Leka> but i want to avoid using id for every element i'm gonna have a unique href in
[07:54:54] <Shwaiil> hi ppl
[07:55:02] <Grom> Leka, you cannot use load to make request to another domain
[07:55:39] <Shwaiil> Q: Let's say I have 1,000,000 elements that I want to hide at the same time. What would be the best way to do it in terms of performance ? This is just a example. Tks
[07:58:05] <razzi> Shwaiil, something involcing their parent i guess
[07:58:08] <razzi> involving*
[07:58:24] <Shwaiil> razzi ok
[07:58:37] <Shwaiil> tks
[08:00:45] <Leka> Grom well, i was using a internal document, but with that, i wont know if it actually works
[08:02:51] <Whirl3dOrd3r> ?.ajax @ Leka
[08:03:00] <Whirl3dOrd3r> bot-t is down?
[08:03:03] <thedeeno> $('selector').css("left", "100px") doesn't appear to work in phantomJS. Anyone had this issue?
[08:03:27] <thedeeno> $('selector').attr("style", "left:100px") does though
[08:04:16] <peterschmidler> Hello everybody. I am trying to integrate Plupload into a website and I have the problem that after my Plupload launch script all following jQuery queries return null. Here's the script: https://gist.github.com/1490593
[08:04:20] <Whirl3dOrd3r> thedeeno, did you try $('selector').css({left:100});
[08:04:32] <thedeeno> nope, i'll try it now
[08:05:46] <demersdesigns> Leka: http://jsfiddle.net/96axR/2/
[08:05:47] <thedeeno> Whirl3dOrd3r: that doesn't work either
[08:06:43] <thedeeno> width works, so I'm confused. Seems like theres something jquery is doing internally with top/left to break it
[08:06:49] <demersdesigns> Leka: should solve the need for needing an id, but not the fact that you cannot use load to make request to another domain
[08:07:08] <Whirl3dOrd3r> is it possible that phantomjs has it's own css method?
[08:07:41] <Whirl3dOrd3r> brb
[08:09:21] <Leka> demersdesigns: i just put google there because i'm using an internal document for .load
[08:09:54] <Leka> demersdesigns: unfrotunately, i still can't get it to load into my #c_main element, which is the point :) it just opens up the entire document
[08:10:15] <peterschmidler> Hello everyone, I wonder if anyone has a clue, why after this script https://gist.github.com/1490593 all jQuery queries return null?
[08:11:19] <ssj> helpcrypto =-O
[08:12:04] <Leka> demersdesigns: i've written the code in various ways, and i can always .load the document, but it never goes into the element that i want
[08:12:06] <thedeeno> Whirl3dOrd3r: phantomjs is a headless browser, so I don't think there's gonna be collisions like that.
[08:13:13] <Leka> http://jsfiddle.net/96axR/4/ is what i got right now, but it doesn't load into the #c_main element
[08:20:08] <peterschmidler> What's the meaning of this function? function $(id) {return document.getElementById(id);};
[08:21:38] <dabear> peterschmidler: that seems to be a shortcut to selecting elements by id
[08:22:07] <dabear> like $("baz") will select an element with id="baz"
[08:22:29] <peterschmidler> dabear: It seems to break my javascript code. Can you imagine any workaround? https://gist.github.com/1490593
[08:22:50] <ssj> shudnt it be $("#baz")
[08:23:00] <ssj> dabear
[08:23:12] <dabear> ssj: please read his question
[08:23:21] <ssj> oh yea
[08:23:29] <ssj> i just read that :)
[08:24:32] <dabear> peterschmidler: try wrapping the entire script around (function(){       /* paste code here*/      })()
[08:25:32] <Zogot> Anyone know of any good programs to test a RESTful application?
[08:25:40] <Zogot> Something that can easily send headers and check responses
[08:26:03] <peterschmidler> dabear <= my man ;)
[08:27:48] <Leka> would $(".menu a").live("click", function() { }); make the a-element, in the .menu-class give the function() to click?
[08:28:03] <demersdesigns> Zogot: Something like http://www.charlesproxy.com?
[08:28:41] <Zogot> oh, something like that might work, thanks demersdesigns
[08:29:07] <demersdesigns> Zogot: No prob! :-)
[08:29:09] <dabear> Leka: huh? any a's clicks will be handled by that func
[08:30:15] <Leka> dabear: hmm, but it doesn't work :( in the function i add $("#c_main").load("href"); <-- maybe it's wrong here?
[08:30:43] <dabear> ?load
[08:30:46] <Leka> the a href obviously always works, but it doesn't .load into my specified element #c_main
[08:32:02] <dabear> well, debug it?
[08:32:17] <Leka> http://jsfiddle.net/96axR/4/
[08:32:20] <dabear> use the webkit inspector or firebug, set a breakpoint
[08:33:07] <xperator> Hi, How can I replace all <p> tags with <tr> ?
[08:33:21] <Zerpex> $('.className').css({ top: $('.className').outerHeight()/2 }); can I somehow say, that it should add an '-' in front of the height it gets?
[08:33:21] <xperator> I have this code : $("p").each(function(index) {
[08:33:22] <xperator>   var newElement = $("<tr>"+ $(this).innerHTML + "</tr>");
[08:33:22] <xperator>   $(this).after(newElement).remove();
[08:33:22] <xperator> });
[08:33:22] <xperator> }
[08:33:40] <xperator> but it's not working
[08:34:22] <demersdesigns> Leka: First thing is that you need to prevent the default action that would normally happen when you click on the a tag.
[08:34:38] <Leka> demersdesigns: return false; ?
[08:34:41] <dabear> Leka: $("#c_main") doesn't exist, at least in the page
[08:34:49] <dabear> in the jsfiddle paste, I meant
[08:34:55] <demersdesigns> Daebar: Yes, that too. :-)
[08:35:04] <Leka> dabear: nah, it does on my page: leka.makasd.se/man/
[08:35:21] <demersdesigns> Leka: I would do function(e){e.preventDefault();}
[08:36:37] <demersdesigns> Leka: Like this ----> http://jsfiddle.net/96axR/6/
[08:36:48] <dabear> main.php was loaded
[08:36:53] <dabear> I see nothing wrong there
[08:37:11] <Leka> try clicking on "menu4"
[08:37:15] <Leka> there in lies the problem :)
[08:38:06] <demersdesigns> Leka: the code above will prevent it from loading the href into the whole window
[08:38:35] <demersdesigns> Then you just need to debug getting .load() to put the requested content where you need it
[08:40:06] <Leka> demersdesigns: you mean the menu1 and menu2 jQuerys?
[08:41:07] <Leka> i'm not quiet sure i follow the "debug" thing, i run np++ and just save directly to my FTP - so no compiling
[08:44:34] <Leka> demersdesigns: ah, i got it now - thanks :D:D
[08:44:46] <demersdesigns> Leka: No worries.
[08:45:24] <felipe_Brz> could someone explain to me what exactly the jquery UI .button(); function does? Does it turn whatever is in selector into a button?
[08:46:20] <Leka> demersdesigns: i'm quiet new to jQuery - so i have a hard time describing my issues properly, i'm sorry for that - but hopefully i'll get better soon ;)
[08:46:54] <demersdesigns> Leka: Not a problem. Hope I was able to help. This may be close to what you are looking for. http://jsfiddle.net/96axR/8/
[08:52:08] <Leka> demersdesigns: yes you did! i learned quiet alot :))
[08:57:07] <tomba_> hi

[11:39:56] <Leka> hi, i'm trying to use .editable but it doesn't save the changes i make to the text. i'm loading up my text document, and it's the same as i'm trying to save my changes to. can it be the same document? or does it have to land somewhere else in between?
[11:40:01] <Leka> $(".edit").editable("sql/00001.txt", {
[11:43:27] <Leka> i load the document like this: <div class="edit"> <?php include("sql/00001.txt")?></div>
[11:43:37] <Leka> and then edit it,and _try_ to save it like this: $(".edit").editable("sql/00001.txt", {
[11:44:04] <Leka> anyone have any idea what i'm doing wrong? :)
[11:44:09] <lxsameer> which one should i use? mouseover or mounseenter ?

[12:11:39] <a|i> how to use .on() to hide an element and will exist in the future, but does not exist now?
[12:13:02] <darias> hello everybodys some know's how can edit table with jquery?
[12:24:09] <alix_> hey there
[12:24:12] <alix_> anyone here?
[12:24:58] <alix_> I'm having a tiny problem with .on()
[12:28:25] <systemfault> Just ask :/
[12:31:31] <alix_> the thing is, it's when I had new element to the dom
[12:31:45] <alix_> it's not working on those new elements
[12:32:30] <systemfault> You understand that without more information, you would need some kind of mind-reading wizard to help you? :(
[12:32:45] <alix_> sure let me give a snippet
[12:33:22] <alix_> but just before, are .on() and .live() the same thing?
[12:34:18] <systemfault> Nope, not at all
[12:34:21] <systemfault> But.
[12:34:41] <systemfault> You can achieve what .live() does with .on by calling it a certain way
[12:35:27] <alix_> how? it's exactly what I'm looking for
[12:36:36] <systemfault> What you would do with live: $('selector', parentElement).live('click', function(){}); becomes
[12:37:03] <systemfault> $(parentElement).on('click', 'selector', function(){});
[12:37:42] <alix_> I see
[12:37:54] <systemfault> With .live, if parentElement is not specified, it's the document body..
[12:38:04] <abjorn> "JavaScript doesn't have TCO, so you're pretty much forced to program it imperatively" I'd like to know what this guy is smoking
[12:38:13] <alix_> and this is nnot good for speed right?
[12:38:22] <systemfault> abjorn: Well, it doesn't have TCO..
[12:38:29] <abjorn> It doesn't
[12:38:33] <abjorn> I know that
[12:38:35] <abjorn> but like
[12:38:36] <systemfault> alix_: .on is cleaner, speed is irrelevant.
[12:38:45] <abjorn> wat
[12:38:48] <alix_> ok
[12:39:23] <systemfault> abjorn: Without more context, I don't know if the lack of TCO is really an issue for his specific problem.
[12:39:54] <alix_> http://jsfiddle.net/m7cNW/
[12:40:07] <abjorn> systemfault: He doesn't have a specific problem, he's just bashing js
[12:40:09] <alix_> I'm pretty sure, you saw that a lot already
[12:40:15] <systemfault> alix_: Dom calls are always slow so always do "prevention", try to select elements the less possible.. cache them in variables.. etc.
[12:40:30] <systemfault> abjorn: Ah.. I see.
[12:41:12] <systemfault> alix_: You're not using event delegation at the moment.
[12:41:20] <systemfault> alix_:  2 seconds, I'll check what I can do
[12:41:31] <alix_> thank you
[12:42:16] <systemfault> alix_: http://jsfiddle.net/m7cNW/1/
[12:42:36] <systemfault> Cherrs.
[12:42:42] <systemfault> *Cheers even.
[12:42:51] <alix_> oh ok
[12:42:54] <alix_> I get it
[12:43:09] <systemfault> 'ol' is the parentElement in that case
[12:43:15] <systemfault> and 'li' the selector
[12:43:15] <alix_> yeah yeah
[12:43:35] <alix_> Thank you, I'm sorry if I've been vague at first
[12:43:45] <systemfault> alix_: It's cool :)
[12:44:34] <alix_> oh and is that the best way to do hover?
[12:45:24] <systemfault> The best is by using CSS :)
[12:45:54] <alix_> of course it is
[12:46:01] <alix_> I'm really stupid
[12:46:24] <systemfault> :/ Don't say that..
[12:46:57] <systemfault> li:hover { color: red; }    :P
[12:47:29] <alix_> actually im just fading in an element
[12:47:44] <alix_> and this can be done with css
[12:48:00] <systemfault> Ahh then you don't have the choice if you want it to work on all browsers
[12:48:21] <systemfault> (I don't really care these days..) :P
[12:48:47] <alix_> it's ok it's for the backend and I have control over which browser they are using so
[12:48:47] <systemfault> Guys on IE7/8 can just live with a degraded version of the website :P
[12:49:01] <alix_> I agree
[12:50:03] <systemfault> Not everyone does :P
[12:50:18] <alix_> indeed
[12:50:25] <systemfault> But the problem is that if we don't do that... we keep the web from evolving.
[12:51:07] <alix_> and that's too bad when we can see what proper css can do :D
[12:54:18] <ezrafree> can anyone tell me why i can't get this menu to close when it loses focus? http://jsfiddle.net/AfyaZ/1/
[12:54:35] <Zerpex> is there an easier way to write this code?: http://pastebin.com/BTLbDYRm it seems pretty large for me, to do that simple thing like centering, and then see if the window is less than some given value in height, or width :O
[12:56:22] <systemfault> Zerpex: You cannot achieve it with CSS?
[12:57:19] <lxsameer> is there any slideLeft ?
[12:59:54] <Zerpex> systemfault: this is the only method I've ever found to center horizontally, and vertically.. and then when the browser window is less than the .className it should give some other styling, where it also works in IE without any external library or something
[13:00:36] <systemfault> Ah ok :)
[13:04:02] <systemfault> Beside some trivial node caching, I can't see anything.
[13:04:49] <Zerpex> I'm not very good at jquery or javascript, so just doing, what I know about it lol :P I'm mostly doing backend
[13:05:10] <systemfault> I'm both :/
[13:07:16] <alix_> systemfault: how am I supposed to do when both my selector and his parent element are generated
[13:08:00] <systemfault> Zerpex: But what I meant.. instead of calling $(window) tons of time... just do: var $window = $(window);then use $window everywhere else
[13:08:15] <systemfault> alix_: Do you have an example?
[13:08:20] <alix_> coming in
[13:08:49] <systemfault> alix_: You could make an element higher in the tree the parent element
[13:09:00] <systemfault> (One that is available)
[13:09:16] <Zerpex> systemfault: should I do the same with $('.classname') ?
[13:09:35] <systemfault> Zerpex: Yes but in that specific case, it won't change much
[13:09:41] <systemfault> Zerpex: I would do it
[13:10:00] <Zerpex> no, but also later on, it would be much easier to define the classname once instead of find / replace
[13:10:36] <systemfault> True ;)
[13:11:19] <Zerpex> lol if I use var $window = $(window); it doesn't work anymore :$
[13:11:50] <systemfault> Hmm
[13:12:53] <Zerpex> now it does :O
[13:14:01] <systemfault> Anyway.. The thing is that DOM access are slow as f... Try to cache the result of selectors when possible.
[13:15:42] <Leka> hi, anyone got a clue why my jeditable function doesn't save my changes? http://jsfiddle.net/uj8dT/
[13:16:22] <alix_> systemfault: when I do such it gives me that "((f.event.special[r.origType] || {}).handle || r.handler).apply is not a function"
[13:16:58] <systemfault> Leka: Seems to work for me (On your website)
[13:17:36] <Leka> systemfault: hmm, it seems you did manage - what browser you runnnin?
[13:18:12] <systemfault> alix_: I still don't have your example so I can't help.. That error message is meaningless :(
[13:18:27] <Leka> systemfault: or, did you actually change anything? i'm not sure
[13:18:27] <systemfault> Leka: Ahhh sorry.. thought you were testing the accordion :( My bad
[13:18:38] <Leka> ahh ^^
[13:18:52] <alix_> I can't even make it work there http://jsfiddle.net/alix/m7cNW/2/ but you see what I want to do
[13:19:12] <alix_> (I want the span item clickable)
[13:19:32] <Leka> systemfault: you got any idea why it doesn't save the changes? any more code i can provide to help me? :)
[13:20:30] <systemfault> Leka: Where is editable called on your website?
[13:20:37] <systemfault> alix_: Checking
[13:22:26] <Leka> systemfault: view-source:http://leka.makasd.se/man/cat/cat_sql.php
[13:22:41] <systemfault> alix_: That http://jsfiddle.net/m7cNW/3/ ?
[13:23:38] <systemfault> Leka: Not 100% sure but I think that .load strips script tags
[13:25:05] <Leka> systemfault: so my problem may lie in the fact that i load the script from a script?
[13:25:26] <alix_> yep thanks I didn't use on() properly, I put the selector at the ned
[13:26:43] <systemfault> Leka: Right.. you should add your editable from the "source page", not the one you load with .load
[13:30:21] <Leka> systemfault: problem is, if i have it anywhere else, the script doesn't know that the class "edit" exists, until it is loaded, and then the jquery isn't working
[13:30:32] <Leka> i guess
[13:32:21] <systemfault> Leka: The load function has a callback in which you could set the editable
[13:34:43] <Leka> systemfault: i don't think i quiet understand, it is indeed located after $(document).ready and the editable seems to work, but the submit doesn't
[13:34:53] <Leka> or save, if you will
[13:36:16] <hellonull> hi all. i was reading in the docs that $.browser is deprecated. what is the best way to use jquery for getting the browser name and version? i am not using it for feature support detection, i just want to get the name and version of the browser (i.e., "Firefox 8.0").
[13:37:11] <systemfault> hellonull: There's no better way if what you really need is the name.
[13:37:47] <systemfault> Your problem is the exception ;)
[13:39:40] <hellonull> sounds good, thanks systemfault
[13:42:03] <Zerpex> hia again, when having: http://pastebin.com/K5r765qd - it adds 20px to the top, instead of 10.. Can anyone tell me why?, and also how I define var $className = $('.className'); doesn't seems to work lol.. but wondering why it adds 20px to the top, instead of only 10 :S
[13:43:47] <Leka> systemfault: i even tried to put the entire function in my index file, but it still doesn't save. is there any way to debug this? http://leka.makasd.se/man/
[13:45:19] <nauthiz> hi all, problem: I apply some .click()s to a class, all working fine. Now I load some other content via ajax with other objects of the same class. They do not have the .click()s applied. How can I get them to use the same events as the 'old
[13:45:29] <nauthiz> ' objects?
[13:45:39] <Misiur> nauthiz: .live ?
[13:45:55] <Misiur> or in 1.7 delegate
[13:46:37] <ezrafree> can anyone tell me why i can't get this menu to close when it loses focus? http://jsfiddle.net/AfyaZ/1/
[13:47:33] <nauthiz> Misiur: thx, didn't know there's somehing like this :D great thing :D
[13:50:06] <lxsameer> is it possible to find out that a text inside a div is a single line or more than single line ?
[13:50:16] <ezrafree> isn't blur() supposed to perform the function whenever that selector loses focus?
[13:50:34] <ezrafree> is there something else i'm missing here? http://jsfiddle.net/AfyaZ/1/
[13:54:16] <Misiur> I'm using jquery tabs and I need to add some stuff next to tabs like http://screenshooter.net/data/uploads/az/br/mtoi.jpg . Question: is there better way than using some absolute positioned magic tricks?
[14:03:10] <ignotus> hi, is it possible to query whether a certain element is currently animating or not?
[14:03:17] <kidconcept> greetings. i'm trying to fix an autosubmit script in IE8. it works in IE9, firfox and chrome, but I cant
[14:03:26] <ignotus> $('#div1').is(':animated')
[14:03:29] <ignotus> ah i've just found it
[14:03:42] <kidconcept> 't figure out what's wrong in 8.  the script is here: http://pastebin.com/rL7iY4eq
[14:03:53] <kidconcept> and here it is on the live site: http://volunteeralliance.org/
[14:04:07] <ignotus> is it possible to check for OR relation, something like $foo.is(':visible||:animated')?
[14:05:33] <ignotus> ah, that is probably .is(':visible,:animated')
[14:06:11] <Zerpex> how can I define: $('.className') as a variable? var className = $('.className'); doesn't work :S
[14:08:04] <ignotus> Zerpex: that seems fine to me
[14:08:24] <dabear> that should work, yes, unless you described incorrectly what you want
[14:09:39] <Zerpex> http://pastebin.com/mtb5wbsT I use $('.classname') a lot in this script, and want to make it to a variable, so I only need to edit it once
[14:10:52] <nauthiz> hi all, is it possible to give an html-element an attribute that is absolute nonsense, but can be used by jquery? Like <span myattrib="nonsense">bla</span> /// $("span[myattrib=nonsense]") ?
[14:12:54] <ignotus> nauthiz: you may want to use a class for that
[14:16:23] <nauthiz> ignotus: no, I really want my own attribute and yes, it works, at least with ff and chrome :)
[14:18:24] <dabear> nauthiz: it should work without issues. however, if you have to do that, I suggest you use data-* attribute names
[14:18:36] <dabear> <div data-foo="bar">
[14:18:47] <nauthiz> whats the difference?
[14:19:07] <dabear> that is's standardized
[14:19:08] <Smekman> Ah what the heck
[14:19:12] <nauthiz> or, why use this convention?
[14:19:13] <nauthiz> ah ok
[14:19:17] <Smekman> I cant join any of the php channels
[14:19:24] <nauthiz> hm, yeah, makes sense
[14:19:48] <dabear> also, .data("foo") will read the data-foo attribute on an element
[14:20:18] <nauthiz> I actually only need one custom attribute, for the rest I use the .dada
[14:20:45] <nauthiz> wtf, have to try this
[14:21:06] <dabear> nauthiz: use only data-foo style atttributes
[14:21:08] <dabear> http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/global-attributes.html#embedding-custom-non-visible-data-with-the-data-attributes
[14:24:47] <nauthiz> dabear: ok, got it, but if I do data-lang="en__txtOnASpan_" and alert( $("span").data("lang") );, I get undefined as return
[14:26:54] <nauthiz> dabear: ok, all back, it works
[14:27:09] <nauthiz> forgot to reload the script
[14:27:15] <dabear> yea
[14:27:31] <nauthiz> great thing, thank you!
[14:34:56] <imsky> who got da props
[14:34:59] <imsky> who got da props
[14:35:54] <ezrafree> anyone know how i can hide a menu i show as a dropdown? http://jsfiddle.net/AfyaZ/1/
[14:36:13] <imsky> what
[14:39:31] <Pookz> how do i get a specific class for $(this)
[14:41:44] <Pookz> I got it with .find
[14:43:36] <ezrafree> does anyone know how i can hide a menu i show as a dropdown? http://jsfiddle.net/AfyaZ/1/
[14:43:49] <ezrafree> i've tried to do so with blur() in my above example
[14:43:56] <ezrafree> i've also tried focusout()
[14:45:10] <ezrafree> anyone have any advice for me?
[14:58:35] <y3di> how do i select an ul element thats inside a div id=resutls?
[14:59:32] <imsky> $("#results ul")
[14:59:37] <astropirate> y3di, $('#results').find(' Selector for your ul ');
[14:59:38] <imsky> ezrafree: are you new to jquery?
[14:59:46] <Leka> is there any way to close a file with jQuery? so that i can access it with php to write stuff to the file, and then open it again?
[15:00:20] <astropirate> Leka, no, bu tyou can use localdb thats part of HTML5 although there is a backwards compatibility issue
[15:01:45] <Leka> astropirate: i see, you wouldn't happen to know how people have jeditable work without using php to write the submitted content, to the file?
[15:02:34] <astropirate> Leka, you can't save files via javascript
[15:02:49] <astropirate> it would be a security desaster
[15:02:54] <ezrafree> can anyone offer any advice?
[15:03:05] <imsky> ezrafree: i've been talking to you lol
[15:03:09] <imsky> are you blind or something
[15:03:12] <Leka> heh, i suppose - but i can't seem to understand how people have it work with jeditable
[15:03:28] <dogarrhea2> hi. why does drop:function(event,ui){console.log(event.pageX);}  log "undefined"?
[15:03:52] <Leka> i submit the edited content to my php, i catch it, and i want to write the new content to my file, but it's obviously already open, so it can't be opened by php
[15:03:58] <ezrafree> imsky: i don't see how you're helping me any...
[15:04:07] <imsky> ezrafree: i'm working on your fiddle
[15:04:09] <imsky> you dick
[15:05:00] <ezrafree> imsky: if using that type of language towards me is your idea of help, no thanks
[15:05:06] <astropirate> Leka, ehh i'm confused.. sounds like you want to write the ifle on the server with php
[15:05:32] <Leka> astropirate: hmm, i'm not that good at explaining, since i'm new to all this - i'm sorry
[15:05:57] <Leka> astropirate: but i did use this guide: http://www.appelsiini.net/projects/jeditable but what he doesn't tell me is how the edited content is actuall saved to the file
[15:06:19] <Leka> actually*
[15:07:21] <y3di> ty imsky and astropirate
[15:07:27] <astropirate> Leka, ohh lol, so you want to edit something on the webpage, and that be saved on the server. for that you will need a database
[15:07:29] <imsky> y3di: np bud
[15:07:45] <astropirate> Leka, or some other way to persist data
[15:08:30] <dogarrhea2> oh
[15:08:37] <dogarrhea2> so jqueryui likes to do some ridiculous crap
[15:08:38] <Leka> astropirate: ah ofcourse, js can't write to file
[15:08:49] <dogarrhea2> and wrap event around a REAL event and call it originalEvent
[15:09:30] <Leka> but php can, so thats why i wanted to close the file somehow, so that php could work it :P
[15:09:32] <astropirate> Leka, yes, so when the somethign is edited on the browser, the browser send the content via AJAX to the server, which saves the content, next time the page loads, the user gets the edited content
[15:09:41] <astropirate> ohh..
[15:09:46] <astropirate> your having php issues
[15:10:00] <astropirate> i'm not a php dev but pastie the relevent php code and i can take a look
[15:10:16] <astropirate> fclose()  is the funciton you want if i am remembering it correctly
[15:10:42] <astropirate> Leka, http://www.tizag.com/phpT/fileclose.php
[15:11:06] <Leka> astropirate: so just to make myself understand it all, once AJAX sends this to the server, i have to store this information, with say; PHP, and use that to write to the file? cause js can't do it, at all? (did i understand you correctly then? :))
[15:12:48] <Leka> astropirate: really appriciate you're patience with a newbie such as myself - and i thank you :)
[15:13:11] <jeffmoss> Leka: your file will be closed when the request ends
[15:13:30] <jeffmoss> Leka: what error are you getting paste it
[15:13:52] <Leka> jeffmoss: go leka.makasd.se/man/ and just edit the text on the right
[15:14:42] <Leka> it seems i got another error now though, wierd
[15:16:29] <Leka> jeffmoss: this is my php code: http://pastebin.com/w6ufMiF6
[15:17:08] <jeffmoss> what's the error you're getting?
[15:17:32] <Leka> Warning: fopen(00001.txt) [function.fopen]: failed to open stream: Permission denied in /var/www/leka/man/cat/sql/save.php on line 9
[15:17:35] <jeffmoss> ah I see
[15:17:35] <Leka> can't open file
[15:17:46] <jeffmoss> this is a permission error on your webserver
[15:18:15] <astropirate> Leka, you need to give apache correct permissions to open the file, you can do that with an FTP client if you are on a shared hosting
[15:18:18] <jeffmoss> the short version is you need to put this 0001 file in a directory that is writable by all
[15:18:56] <Leka> astropirate: ye, np i got SSH up and running, along with SFTP
[15:19:02] <jeffmoss> Leka: personally, I would just skip ahead and use a mysql database or something like that
[15:19:06] <Leka> what file am i looking for?
[15:19:25] <astropirate> Leka, jeffmoss++
[15:19:31] <Leka> jeffmoss: yea, just that its such a hazzle just to test the actual jeditable ^^,
[15:19:52] <jeffmoss> it's creating 00001.txt in the same directory as your pHP script, you probably want a subdirectory right there
[15:20:01] <jeffmoss> create a folder data or something
[15:20:07] <jeffmoss> mkdir data
[15:20:09] <jeffmoss> chmod a+w data
[15:20:21] <jeffmoss> do that in the shell
[15:20:24] <Leka> it gets write permission in subfolders?
[15:20:42] <jeffmoss> $myFile = "data/00001.txt";
[15:20:52] <jeffmoss> make sense?
[15:21:01] <Leka> indeed
[15:21:13] <Leka> but would it solve privilegies?
[15:21:20] <Leka> write etc.
[15:21:31] <jeffmoss> the chmod a+w data will eliminate the permission denied error
[15:24:04] <imsky> ezrafree: http://jsfiddle.net/AfyaZ/2/
[15:27:26] <ezrafree> imsky, wow, thanks... i guess there was no easy way to explain that =/
[15:27:47] <imsky> you're welcome.
[15:27:55] <ezrafree> i mean that was no small change, that's pretty different now
[15:28:05] <Leka> jeffmoss: now i get the error where i can't open the file again, instead of write issues
[15:28:35] <jeffmoss> Warning: fopen(00001.txt) [function.fopen]: failed to open stream: Permission denied in /var/www/leka/man/cat/save.php on line 9
[15:28:35] <jeffmoss> can't open file
[15:28:47] <Leka> i got: Warning:  fopen(00001.txt) [function.fopen]: failed to open stream: Permission denied in /var/www/leka/man/cat/save.php on line 9
[15:28:50] <Leka> can't open file
[15:28:56] <Leka> oh wrong copy paste
[15:29:02] <Leka> Warning:  fopen(00001.txt) [function.fopen]: failed to open stream: Permission denied in /var/www/leka/man/cat/save.php on line 9
[15:29:09] <jeffmoss> did you do this step: $myFile = "data/00001.txt";
[15:29:10] <imsky> do you bros not know about chmod
[15:29:14] <imsky> ?g chmod @ Leka
[15:29:14] <Leka> yep
[15:29:15] <bot-t> Leka, chmod - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod
[15:29:38] <imsky> lucky 7s on everything!
[15:29:55] <Leka> it should already be set to 777
[15:31:35] <imsky> i guess you're just in the wrong channel then
[15:32:24] <Leka> imsky: i suppose subfolders/files recieve the parent directorys 7s ? :)
[15:32:36] <imsky> not really, chmod isn't recursive by default
[15:32:48] <imsky> you have to call it with -R
[15:33:05] <Leka> imsky: ah cool, thanks
[15:33:21] <imsky> yw
[15:34:04] <Leka> dear god it's working now
[15:34:18] <Leka> been working with this for 5 hours straight, how embaressing
[15:34:38] <Leka> you guys are amazing, thanks for your help and patience! :D
[15:35:33] <imsky> lol
[15:35:55] <Leka> yep, that'd be my word of choise as well :p
[15:42:17] <y3di> whats the fastest method for creating dom elements?
[15:42:31] <imsky> straight html
[15:42:38] <imsky> <div>pootis pootis pootis</div>
[15:42:49] <abjorn> oh sup imsky
[15:43:02] <imsky> oh sawp abjorn
[15:43:10] <imsky> btw, you gotta add your emails to github
[15:43:18] <abjorn> i gotta, huh?
[15:43:19] <imsky> your latest commits to brobot are showing up as "other"
[15:43:38] <abjorn> lol
[15:45:29] <imsky> mmmmm gonna go walk the dogs
[15:46:02] <y3di> imsky: what if im creating complex dom elements? with nested elements and stuff like that
[15:46:21] <imsky> y3di: are you really asking this in #jquery? don't you know about .append and the rest?
[15:47:47] <y3di> i do, i just feel like just generating long chunks of html strings to create html elements might not be the most readable/fastest method
[15:48:17] <imsky> what are you trying to do
[15:50:14] <y3di> im making li elements from a list of objects, with html nested in the li generated from the fields of an object.
[15:50:46] <y3di> but yur saying i should just use strings to do all of that for the fastest speed
[15:51:00] <y3di> which can be done, I was just curious if it was he best way
[15:51:23] <imsky> why not just use templates
[15:52:47] <y3di> hm, i wasn't aware jquery had templating functionality
[15:52:50] <y3di> ill look into that
[15:53:15] <imsky> you can do it without jquery templates too
[15:53:21] <imsky> just basic string replacement
[15:53:38] <y3di> right, that was the initial plan
[15:53:56] <Jon47> jquery has a half-baked .tmpl method but it's not being actively developed
[15:53:59] <Zelest> :q
[15:54:03] <Zelest> err
[15:55:03] <ezrafree> imsky it seems now the menu can _only_ be closed by clicking somewhere else
[16:01:44] <imsky> ezrafree: ok..i thought you had that covered, but here you are: http://jsfiddle.net/imsky/VQg5S/1/
[16:01:52] <dogarrhea2> is there anything out there that lets you find the difference in pixels between one drag event and the next?
[16:02:37] <imsky> .tmpl is also slow
[16:09:30] <wookiehangover> imsky: and no longer supported
[16:09:42] <wookiehangover> handlebars is a very good choice, IMO
[16:09:47] <imsky> wat
[16:10:02] <imsky> lol handlebars, mustache
[16:10:08] <wookiehangover> https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl
[16:10:29] <wookiehangover> imsky: wats better
[16:10:34] <imsky> doT/doU
[16:10:41] <imsky> it's _clinically_ better
[16:11:29] <Rotham_> hey.. kinda a javascript noob here but :  with: "Date {Sat Dec 10 2011 00:00:00 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)}"  as my date object date.getMonth() returns '11'... is that normal?
[16:11:43] <wookiehangover> eh, that's debatable

[16:19:20] <imsky> wookiehangover: just ran the results: http://jsperf.com/dom-vs-innerhtml-based-templating/214
[16:19:48] <imsky> handlebars got 30k, doT got 728k. in a newer test, handlebars got 150k
[16:20:18] <wookiehangover> does doT support pre-compiling?
[16:20:34] <imsky> read about it and see
[16:21:48] <wookiehangover> i dunno, I thought that asking someone that's used them seriously would be a good source of info
[16:21:50] <wookiehangover> but nvm
[16:22:35] <imsky> lol
[16:22:46] <imsky> handlebars doesn't support precompiling, so dunno why you're asking
[16:23:32] <wookiehangover> ummmm
[16:23:34] <wookiehangover> ya it does
[16:24:10] <imsky> lol

[16:39:22] <imsky> yeah, it's still good, sell it
[16:39:32] <wookiehangover> imsky only uses the computers that are available at the library
[16:39:39] <gloomer> ya youll get like 80% of your money and 50% of your self respect back
[16:39:40] <wookiehangover> so he can't be that choosy
[16:39:44] <imsky> nice sleeve tat, wookiehangover
[16:39:51] <riyonuk> hate windows.
[16:40:16] <felipe_Brz> I'm adapting a layout I have to the jQuery UI CSS framework see here http://pastie.org/3033880 ...  My doubt us whether the div whose id is #wrapper should have the ui-widget or the ui-widget content class...????
[17:08:20] <techouse> how do i replace a node's name?
[17:16:40] <techouse> ok, solved it :)
[17:20:20] <imsky> good job buddy
[17:28:53] <dave_ddc> Is there a jQuery function that I can use to apply the current browser's stock button style to my .button class?
[17:29:59] <dave_ddc> I've tried .addClass(), but it doesn't seem to work on styles that aren't user defined.
[18:14:01] <dogarrhea2> is jquery animate supposed to flicker when you drag things?
[18:19:12] <astropirate> dogarrhea2, only on really slow computers
[18:19:18] <astropirate> and ie 6 and bellow
[18:19:22] <dogarrhea2> lol
[18:21:07] <Rotham_> hey
[18:21:35] <pifantastic> Rotham_: hey
[18:22:05] <Rotham_> Are there any javascript templating engines out there you would recommend?
[18:22:11] <Rotham_> that are fairly easy to use with jquery
[18:22:14] <dogarrhea2> hmm i can't seem to solve the problem of dragging one item and having everything else animate in lockstep..
[18:22:18] <pifantastic> Rotham_: Handlebars.js
[18:22:31] <Rotham_> cool thanks
[18:23:14] <fris> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.tmpl/
[18:23:43] <dogarrhea2> is css("top":"+=2px") ok to do?
[18:23:55] <dogarrhea2> er css({"top":"+=2px"});
[18:24:12] <coldhead> ?tias
[18:24:12] <bot-t> Try It And See
[18:25:13] <dogarrhea2> ok it's fne but doesn't do what i expect heh
[18:25:18] <dogarrhea2> i think it's better than animate though
[18:25:25] <dogarrhea2> which has some funny after effeects
[18:25:55] <pifantastic> dogarrhea2: definitely better to create another CSS class with the adjusted top
[18:26:01] <pifantastic> and call removeClass/addClass
[18:26:21] <dogarrhea2> nope
[18:26:32] <dogarrhea2> i'm having continuous movement. i'm not creating 1 class for each pixel on screen
[18:26:39] <pifantastic> oh
[18:26:40] <pifantastic> kk
[18:27:54] <dogarrhea2> the functionality is like this:  think of trains. if one cart moves, everyone else moves
[18:28:01] <dogarrhea2> every other cart
[18:29:42] <PseudoNim> hey
[18:30:10] <PseudoNim> i'm calling a html which contains a form with data-role=dialog ... and since it's called via ajax, the javascript in the dialog doesn't get parsed
[18:30:11] <pifantastic> PseudoNim: hey
[18:30:17] <PseudoNim> anything i can do?
[18:30:40] <PseudoNim> (what's worse, jquery *styles* the form, so the submit button doesn't even work since i can't assign data-role="none" to it, ha)
[18:31:14] <tolland_> hey
[18:31:57] <pifantastic> PseudoNim: right, html() wont execute javascript.
[18:32:02] <pifantastic> tolland_: hey
[18:32:18] <PseudoNim> pifantastic: yup so it appears. can i do anything? i saw someone load it using .get()
[18:32:38] <PseudoNim> buuuuut i don't know how to do that with a button that would lead to a "dialog" - since jquery kind of masks that, normally
[18:33:14] <pifantastic> PseudoNim: why do you want to run javascript that is inside a dialog, instead of just having the javascript already loaded
[18:33:33] <pifantastic> jquery has nice little callbacks for all sorts of dialog events
[18:33:54] <PseudoNim> it's possible i'm doing it wrong, fair enough
[18:33:58] <PseudoNim> what i'm trying to do is
[18:34:20] <PseudoNim> load a .php inside a dialog with some parameters, then submit a form and make the dialog go away and return to where it was called from
[18:35:49] <pifantastic> PseudoNim: so the dialog has an "open" event
[18:36:08] <dogarrhea2> is there a selector that does something like this: "Select everything like this element, except the element iself"
[18:36:11] <dogarrhea2> i'm using
[18:36:12] <pifantastic> when you open the dialog, bind an event to the dialog's submit button
[18:36:29] <pifantastic> so when it is submitted, you can call the dialog's close() method
[18:36:37] <PseudoNim> mm interesting
[18:36:40] <PseudoNim> i didn't think of that
[18:36:50] <PseudoNim> does the submit button's id have to be unique, or does it get destroyed on close?
[18:37:00] <pifantastic> dogarrhea2: how did you obtain "this element"
[18:37:11] <pifantastic> PseudoNim: all IDs have to be unique
[18:37:12] <dogarrhea2> in an event listener like $(this)
[18:37:18] <pifantastic> PseudoNim: at any given time
[18:37:18] <PseudoNim> pifantastic: okay
[18:37:29] <dogarrhea2> there are others who share a class with it but i don't want to select the element itself
[18:38:30] <pifantastic> dogarrhea2: interesting. I think the best choice is to add/remove classes. but you may also do $("whatever").each(function() { if (this == myElement) return });
[18:38:37] <Nomikos> If I have: imgItem.css({"borderColor":"green"}).animate({"borderColor":"red"}, 4000);
[18:38:39] <PseudoNim> pifantastic: but hang on ... in that case, considering the submit button is contained within the PHP file that gets loaded, how can i give it a unique ID since it won't be rendered by jquery? or are you saying i should include the submit button into the *dialog*, rather than having the PHP script output it?
[18:38:53] <Nomikos> Why would the border first turn white, and then animate to red?
[18:39:04] <Nomikos> if I take the animate part of, it does turn red
[18:39:14] <Nomikos> ehrm. *green.
[18:39:20] <pifantastic> PseudoNim: you dont have to give it a unique ID. I presume it will be the only submit button in the dialog, right? so $(dialog).find('input[type=submit]');
[18:39:59] <PseudoNim> pifantastic: ahh, cool, that would work indeed
[18:44:21] <Nomikos> Can someone explain why the first item turns white instead of green, before animating to red? http://jsfiddle.net/jaDR3/
[18:51:33] <Nomikos> Funnily enough with background it does work
[18:54:46] <dogarrhea2> ok
[18:54:50] <dogarrhea2> finally found the :not selector
[18:55:00] <gloomer> im not sure nomikos but i wonder why
[18:56:40] <Nomikos> gloomer: updated to http://jsfiddle.net/jaDR3/3/
[18:56:57] * Nomikos tries other browser
[18:59:39] <sirtophat> http://nyhacker.org/~sirtophat/a/ I can't see why the json parser is raising an error, that's valid json
[19:01:38] <dogarrhea2> anyone know how to use the :Not selector? how to select all children of an element except for something with a specific class?
[19:04:09] <gloomer> http://api.jquery.com/not-selector/
[19:08:26] <dogarrhea2> how do you parse the class attribute out of a class with multiple attributes?
[19:09:06] <Nomikos> dogarrhea2: are you looking for hasClass() ?
[19:09:31] <dogarrhea2> i'm trying to use the :not selector to do everything to all sibilings
[19:09:36] <dogarrhea2> except the element itself
[19:12:38] <hightekvagabond> dogarrhea2: I just killed all my browser windows and don't have my cheat sheet, but I seem to recall there is a way to select all siblings of an element
[19:13:01] <Nomikos> dogarrhea2: try $(this).siblings().not(this).doYourStuff()
[19:13:14] <ajpiano> by default, siblings doesn't include the element itself....
[19:13:33] <Nomikos> Ha, that makes it even easier :-)
[19:13:52] <ajpiano> unless you're calling it on more than one element, which happen to be each other's siblings
[19:14:11] <ajpiano> and you can use .not(domElementOrSelector) to filter anything out of a set that you have
[19:14:27] <Nomikos> ajpiano: while you're here, any idea on this one? http://jsfiddle.net/jaDR3/5/
[19:14:59] <ajpiano> i'm on terrible train wifi, the chances of a jsfiddle loading are slim to none
[19:15:03] <dogarrhea2> ajpiano i read somewhere the :not is much faster
[19:15:06] <Nomikos> ok, np then
[19:15:09] <ajpiano> s/a jsfiddle/any website
[19:15:23] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: did you read it in the Book Of Made Up Not True Facts About jQuery
[19:15:26] <ajpiano> cause that's the opposite of true
[19:15:30] <dogarrhea2> it's on the forums
[19:15:49] <ajpiano> so are things like "My site is completely unavailable because of you! You bitch!"
[19:15:51] <ajpiano> so
[19:16:11] <frenocha> hi
[19:16:13] <ajpiano> that's not what i'd call a "convincing argument"
[19:16:45] <ajpiano> Nomikos: i would try including the latest version of jQuery.color from git
[19:16:47] <dogarrhea2> i read down the page and no one seemd to refute..
[19:17:05] <ajpiano> the one that's bundled in ui is old enough that it *might* not cover those edge cases in border color
[19:17:13] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: i'm refuting it *right now*
[19:18:00] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: :not is a custom selector that requires a lot of parsing inside of jQuery, .not is a really simple filter
[19:18:14] <ajpiano> dogarrhea2: .eq() is faster than :eq(), etc etc
[19:18:30] <dogarrhea2> ok.
[19:22:11] <dogarrhea2> ajpiano what does this site mean? http://jsperf.com/jquery-css3-not-vs-not
[19:23:04] <Nomikos> Hrm, no dice
[19:23:25] <ajpiano> it means that in browsers where you already are wayyyyy faster on processing selectors because they actually support :not natively through QSA, you get beter perf
[19:23:39] <ajpiano> but it's slower in IE which is the only place where the perf might actually make a diff
[19:24:12] <ajpiano> some of this stuff has changed over time with the advent of QSA
[19:28:29] <Nomikos> Hm, UI 1.8.5 doesn't animate the borderColor at all. 1.8.9 and the jQuery.color plugin do animate, but from white to target colour only
[19:29:23] <Nomikos> Should I file something somewhere?
[19:29:50] <ajpiano> Nomikos: the jquery color repo would be the ideal place for that
[19:31:10] <dogarrhea2> shoot. when i drag something that's draggable and put something in the event listener to animate everything else to follow it, the dragged item still is not in lockstep
[19:31:24] <dogarrhea2> i would have to animate the entire parent element..
[19:31:32] <dogarrhea2> but that's going to mess thing sup
[19:32:08] <dogarrhea2> is there a way to make all siblings drag along with the dragged element?
[19:32:13] <dogarrhea2> this seems like a simple concept.
[19:32:43] <ajpiano> use a draggable helper that includes all the siblings cloned into the helper
[19:32:49] <ajpiano> you can have a function return your helper
[19:32:57] <ajpiano> that will create the illusion that all the siblings are being dragged
[19:34:04] <dogarrhea2> what's a helper?
[19:34:44] <Nomikos> Ah, they know about it and are working on it already, looks like.
[19:34:51] <ajpiano> http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#option-helper
[19:36:30] <dogarrhea2> i don't get it.
[19:36:48] <dogarrhea2> whats this "original" "clone" stuff
[19:39:19] <dogarrhea2> what's a helper?
[19:40:30] <dogarrhea2> ok googling.. i see some view helpers.. some css helpers
[19:40:36] <dogarrhea2> nothing about a draggable ui helper
[19:40:43] <dogarrhea2> what's a sortable helper?
[19:40:53] <cambazz> hello, how do I get the page height? now window height
[19:40:58] <cambazz> err not
[19:41:10] <dogarrhea2> " the jQuery object representing the helper that's being dragged" is very undescriptive
[19:41:15] <dogarrhea2> and so is the bit about the sortable helper
[19:42:18] <cambazz> like how do i know the height of body
[19:43:31] <dogarrhea2> ok i can't figure out what a helper is
[19:43:33] <dogarrhea2> this is retarded
[19:43:39] <dogarrhea2> and documentation is bad.
[19:46:03] <Nomikos> cambazz: $('body').height()
[19:47:38] <Nomikos> cambazz: which can of course be less than the visible content area
[19:47:49] <dogarrhea2> ok i'm done for the night i can't handle the retardedness of jquery ui
[19:48:25] <dogarrhea2> why don't people realize that using the same word in the definition doesn't help at all
[19:48:41] <dogarrhea2> "definition of gratuitous is something that is gratuitous"
[19:49:25] <kracker> hey guys i'm trying to use  the following code,     location.href = "#articlesByAuthor";
[19:50:01] <kracker> but when I run this code, it does not take me to the anchor directly, instead i end up in the middle of the page with the anchor just above the bottom of the page
[19:50:24] <kracker> it's strange because i can go to the anchor directly on the page just fine
[19:50:57] <kracker> but when I try to use javascript to change this I it does not move the page so that the anchor is at the top of the page
[19:51:07] <kracker> has anyone else experianced this before?
[19:55:16] <kracker> i can't even thing of a way to work around this behafior
[19:55:19] <kracker> behavior
[19:55:27] <kracker> seems mozilla and chrome both do this ...
[19:55:52] <gloomer> kracker you could just use a scroll to anchor instead of a redirect
[19:56:10] <kracker> oh ok
[19:56:16] <kracker> that sounds acceptable
[19:56:33] <kracker> though i'm still fairly new to jquery i'm not sure just how to do that offhand
[20:01:33] <dogarrhea2> cool. the documentation that links to helper documentation doesn't even have the word "help" on it
[20:01:49] <dogarrhea2> what the hell is going on here
[20:06:01] <Nomikos> I have a little image chooser div with clickable thumbs, that can set some element on the page to the clicked image's name
[20:06:21] <Nomikos> how can I make it so that it can be used for different targets?
[20:06:48] <Nomikos> so that I can use the same imageChooseDiv, with the same thumbs, only have the target be "dynamic"
[20:07:13] <Nomikos> is there some way to pass along a SAE, as it were?
[20:07:27] <ryanfriedman> hry guys
[20:10:52] <Kelly2121> hey guys
[20:12:30] <Kelly2121> does anybody know the proper syntax with jQuery and R
[20:12:38] <Kelly2121> for example:  $('#mylisting').html('<%= (mylistings_count(current_user)) %>');
[20:13:00] <Nomikos> uhm. what is R?
[20:13:27] <Kelly2121> Rails
[20:13:49] <Nomikos> So, serverside? Are you using jQuery serverside also?
[20:16:44] <Kelly2121> hmm im trying to use jquery in that function serverside but mostly client
[20:16:54] <Kelly2121> otherwise, mostly client
[20:19:23] <Nomikos> Unless you have something on the server that executes JS, you can't use jQuery to steer RoR around
[20:19:45] <Kelly2121> hmmm how come a function like this :
[20:19:47] <Kelly2121>     $('#reviews_count').html('<%= pluralize(@review.product.reviews.count, "Review") %>');
[20:19:50] <Kelly2121> works ?
[20:20:03] <Nomikos> that is an excellent question and I have no idea :-)
[20:21:41] <gloomer> seems to insert html for the count of reviews held in mvc
[20:22:37] <Kelly2121> is uses the html function but it inserts erb
[20:34:03] <Nomikos> whoa, you can use data() to store references to random objects
[20:36:39] <knightrage> hi all. doing some ajax stuff, and im looking at the 'success' callback. looking at the docs, it says the success event is only called  if the request was successful (no errors from the server, no errors with the data).
[20:36:46] <knightrage> what constitutes 'no errors with the data' ?
[20:37:40] <Nomikos> maybe malformed json, if json's what you are expecting?
[20:48:51] <knightrage> hrm
[20:56:34] <jcrawford> hey guys I have several different div panels on a page, I have the following jquery $(".panelContainer .panelHeader").click(function() { $('.leftPanel .panelBody').toggle(); }) <-- is there a way to reference the clicked item rather than having to hard code the leftPanel in there?  It could be leftPanel, rightPanel, middlePanel that was clicked and I want to show / hide the panelBody for the proper one
[20:57:54] <Nomikos> `this` will always refer to whatever was clicked, inside the .click(function() {.. body
[20:58:14] <Nomikos> and if you use it like $(this), it becomes a jquery object and you can do jquery things to it
[20:59:07] <Nomikos> jcrawford: but in your example, are the clicked item and the item being toggled the same?
[20:59:21] <jcrawford> right but now I need to get a sub sibling element based on this
[20:59:39] <jcrawford> Nomikos: no they are not the same item, it's the next sibling
[21:00:54] <Nomikos> foo.click( function() { $(this).sibling('.panelThing') ?
[21:01:05] <Nomikos> something like that, I think, do you have the url?
[21:01:08] <sirtophat> http://nyhacker.org/~sirtophat/a/ any ideas with these unexpected string errors?
[21:01:31] <jcrawford> Nomikos: will try that thanks'
[21:05:08] <m0dmd> what is the trick to making sure my html background-image remains positioned to the bottom upon scrolling
[21:05:41] <jcrawford> Nomikos: $(this).sibling not a function
[21:06:12] <Nomikos> ehrm *s: .siblings(), my bad
[21:06:16] <Nomikos> http://api.jquery.com/siblings/
[21:06:33] <jcrawford> had to use $(this).next().toggle();
[21:06:49] <jcrawford> since it is a direct sibling this is easier :D
[21:07:19] <Nomikos> Ok. The important part is $(this), there are many ways to then get the "right" element, depends on the circumstances
[21:07:34] <Nomikos> next() is nice and simple :)
[21:10:29] <jcrawford> yep but it also caused problems had to go back to siblings :D
[21:11:03] <Nomikos> Yea, explicit often works best
[21:11:35] <jcrawford> hmm ok having a small odd issue,
[21:11:54] <jcrawford> moment going to fiddle it
[21:13:47] <jcrawford> ok so why is this happening: http://jsfiddle.net/aH87X/1/
[21:14:03] <jcrawford> click on the first text Total Coins Distributed, then click Total Bike Bucks Distributed
[21:14:12] <jcrawford> notice how the second one had a big blank white area?
[21:14:22] <jcrawford> the 3rd does not have that, so why would the middle box behave like that?
[21:15:59] <Nomikos> uh.. "css". The first block is pushing it down or something? Second block white-area disappears when you toggle the first again
[21:16:57] <Nomikos> At least I think it's something page-layout related and I'm sorry but I couldn't css my way out of a paper bag >.<
[21:17:19] <jcrawford> ok i will ask in #css thanks
[21:17:41] <Nomikos> Try Chrome/Safari's inspector things, they might show something
[21:17:59] <Nomikos> (#css? oh dear.. good luck!)
[21:22:26] <m0dmd> figured it out WOOHOO
[21:25:42] <gloomer> jcrawford
[21:25:50] <gloomer> position:absolute; on your left col
[21:25:59] <jcrawford> hmm trying now
[21:26:32] <jcrawford> gloomer: thanks very much that solved the issue :D
[21:26:40] <gloomer> np
[21:28:22] <jcrawford> i gotta read up more on css positioning :D
[21:30:22] <gloomer> ya tricky
[21:33:09] <meth>     this.css( 'top',  5)
[21:33:12] <meth> would that be wrong ?
[21:34:01] <Nomikos> '5px' might work better
[21:34:10] <meth> oh weird now i see it returns 5px
[21:34:21] <meth> i was just trying to move the element lets say 5 pixels down
[21:34:24] <meth> from where it currently is
[21:35:10] <Nomikos> and make sure `this` is a jquery object, if the css() is a jquery function
[21:35:33] <meth> yep... offset().top worked a bit better
[21:36:31] <hadees> i'm trying to use the autocomplete plugin but nothing is happening.  I'm not even getting an error in the console.
[21:36:50] <gloomer> post in jfiddle hadees
[21:37:56] <meth> can i hold random data in my jquery elements ?
[21:38:14] <meth> nvm
[21:39:13] <jcrawford> have a good evening guys time to sleep for me :D
[21:39:18] <jcrawford> almost 1am
[21:39:29] <jcrawford> thanks for the assistance tonight
[21:39:32] <Nomikos> almost 7 am here :p
[21:39:50] <jcrawford> Nomikos: i'll be back here working again by then my time im sure :D
[21:39:55] <Nomikos> one of these months I'll manage a human schedule again
[21:40:07] <Nomikos> woa, early started
[21:40:11] <Nomikos> *starter
[21:40:25] <jcrawford> yea and on weekends
[21:40:29] <jcrawford> crunch time ya know :D
[21:40:33] <jcrawford> deadlines come quick
[21:40:42] <Nomikos> hmm.. pre-Christmas
[21:40:52] <Nomikos> same reason I'm still working :p
[21:41:06] <jcrawford> :D
[21:43:30] <Nomikos> short night's sleep
[21:44:31] <X99> ;P
[21:45:01] <jcrawford> actually before I go
[21:45:06] <jcrawford> lol Nomikos
[21:45:12] <jcrawford> anyone know why this is working the way it is? http://jsfiddle.net/aH87X/2/
[21:45:21] <jcrawford> click on the text in the output area
[21:45:33] <jcrawford> i would like it to start in the left corner not the center
[21:45:38] <jcrawford> not sure why that's happening
[21:46:38] <jcrawford> ahhh I got it
[21:46:45] <jcrawford> just had to put a width on my .panelBody
[21:46:54] <jcrawford> goodnight this time i mean it :D..... I think
[21:47:06] <Nomikos> Back in the good old days, we had tables for this kind of thing
[21:47:19] <Nomikos> and we /liked/ 'm!
[21:48:11] <jcrawford> yeh tables suck now days though :D
[21:48:19] <Nomikos> pfft :p
[21:49:03] <Nomikos> tabular data -> tables
[21:50:05] <Nomikos> but whether "2 columns" == "tabular data" is debateable, I suppose..
[21:51:14] <tinker007> hi..gotta question i need answered...
[21:51:38] <tinker007> anyone wanna take a crack at it
[21:51:39] <tinker007> ?
[21:52:10] <Nomikos> is it about css?
[21:52:27] <tinker007> its about reading xml with jquery/ajax
[21:52:32] <Nomikos> phew
[21:52:52] <tinker007> i found I could read the xml if i looped it using the each function
[21:52:58] <tinker007> not a huge problem
[21:53:26] <tinker007> but if I wanted to go to certain nodes and grab attributes...i found the selectors didn't work
[21:53:39] <tinker007> and I had the latest version of jquery...so it stumped me
[21:54:11] <tinker007> anyone got any ideas..?
[21:55:04] * Nomikos never works with ajax-xml :/
[21:55:15] <Nomikos> nor jquery/xml, really
[21:55:26] <sirtophat> http://nyhacker.org/~sirtophat/a/ any ideas with these unexpected string errors?
[21:55:37] <tinker007> i see...thanks Nomikos..
[21:55:58] <sirtophat> waot
[21:56:03] <sirtophat> wait weird it's different
[21:56:06] <sirtophat> I don't know what happened never mind
[21:59:56] <tinker007> hey sirtophat..i saw no specification for the buttons value.so there is no text on the button..thats all I can see right now..
[22:00:08] <sirtophat> button doesn't matter
[22:00:13] <sirtophat> something broke in a different way
[22:00:37] <Nomikos> It's sending the entire page + some json back, every second?
[22:00:42] <sirtophat> now I'm getting a warning about eventX and eventY being deprecated
[22:01:01] <sirtophat> yeah
[22:01:04] <sirtophat> it's going to be an mmo
[22:01:19] <sirtophat> the json is the state of the game
[22:01:29] <sirtophat> the background/what objects and their positions
[22:02:08] <sirtophat> well actually not exactly
[22:02:19] <tinker007> i noticed sirtophat you don't have a head tag or a closeing body tag...good idea to have matching tags..i found out the hard way divs don't agree with html 5 conventions very well
[22:02:32] <sirtophat> they've been fine for me so far
[22:03:28] <sirtophat> JS Client sends action to PHP, PHP writes to queue file, separate from this a python script that's the 'server' is constantly reading the queue file and appropriately updating the file containing the state of the game, and the JS client reads the game state file at an interval
[22:04:06] <sirtophat> is what it will be
[22:04:11] <tinker007> i noticed the scripts are not within a head opening closing tag...that can cause problems..
[22:04:18] <sirtophat> it's not that exactly yet as I'm trying to just get the basics of some of it to work
[22:04:28] <sirtophat> it's valid html5
[22:05:07] <tinker007> i am just saying from my own experience..
[22:05:46] <tinker007> your way ahead of me in php and jscript though...
[22:05:54] <tinker007> i have been just getting into that..
[22:06:06] <Nomikos> the javascript is running fine, it's just that the return data is "<html>-then-some-json"
[22:06:28] <Nomikos> so something serverside is writing to, or grabbing from the wrong file?
[22:06:47] <tinker007> well there is a closing html tag missing..
[22:07:05] <tinker007> that could certainly cause problems
[22:07:37] <Nomikos> the browser will add one in the DOM ;-)
[22:08:13] <sirtophat> well I don't know what's up with the event.layerx/y warnings but they seem not to affect anything
[22:08:17] <ajpiano> button needs a closing tag, dupliated ids, etc.
[22:08:23] <ajpiano> sirtophat: event layerX layerY is nbd
[22:08:23] <Nomikos> if you select-all on the page, then "view selection source", there are closing body and html tags. browsers are cunning like that
[22:08:25] <ajpiano> just upgrade your jquery
[22:08:28] <sirtophat> but it works now
[22:08:35] <ajpiano> it's something they recently deprecated in chrome
[22:09:31] <ajpiano> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10531
[22:09:46] <Nomikos> sirtophat: uhm, now it's putting the json data /before/ the html data, but you're still getting both back. Have you tried firebug?
[22:09:59] <sirtophat> there's no problem right now
[22:10:04] <Nomikos> :-)
[22:10:11] <sirtophat> I reverted the file to an older copy
[22:10:51] <ajpiano> sirtophat: it doesn't really make sense to embed a json payload inside of html
[22:11:00] <ajpiano> it makes a lot more sense to return json with a string of html as a property
[22:11:15] <ajpiano> if you need both arbitrary json data and markup in a single request
[22:11:18] <sirtophat> http://nyhacker.org/~sirtophat/a/infrastructure.png
[22:11:34] <ajpiano> delightful
[22:11:56] <sirtophat> really it should be reading the state file with ajax right now
[22:12:18] <sirtophat> it's just getting the state from the php as a shortcut right now while I get the basics functioning
[22:12:24] <ajpiano> i think it would be better if i just went back to not being online for now
[22:12:53] <tinker007> what does json do in a nutshell?
[22:13:09] <sirtophat> it's a method of communication between programs
[22:13:24] <tinker007> thanks sirt
[22:13:25] <ajpiano> sort of
[22:13:31] <ajpiano> it's a data format
[22:13:34] <Nomikos> in a nutshell it's a great way to store arbitrary data
[22:13:53] <Nomikos> http://json.org/
[22:14:01] <ajpiano> "JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language."
[22:14:03] <ajpiano> lol
[22:14:04] <tinker007> oh ok..sounds good...well gonna log off..thanks guys for some input..i learned a few things..
[22:14:16] <sirtophat> night
[22:14:19] <Nomikos> o/
[22:14:24] <tinker007> night
[22:15:05] <sirtophat> well now I'm too tired to do this
[22:17:09] <Nomikos> <div id="id_\nNotice: Undefined variable: ... these critters are hiding too damn well
[22:44:55] <mrryanjohnston> is there a way to do something like $('<table>').append('<tr class='+x); a more jQuery-ish way
[22:46:15] <mrryanjohnston>  $('<table>').append('<tr class='+x+'>')
[22:46:19] <mrryanjohnston> rather
[22:58:15] <MeirD> How can I get the closest parent of an element which has a class (no matter which class, just has a class attribute)?
[22:59:13] <MeirD> elem.parent().closest("*") .. and now someone to check if hasClass
[22:59:58] <ajpiano> MeirD: elem.closest("[class]")
[23:01:50] <MeirD> perfect! thanks!
[23:02:14] <MeirD> is there anyway how can now know what number of parent is this?
[23:02:27] <MeirD> i.e. it was matched on the i-th parent
[23:02:37] <ajpiano> not without it getting pretty kludgy
[23:02:40] <ajpiano> why do you need to know that
[23:08:39] <MeirD> <ajpiano> got disconnected. did you get my question about the i-th parent?
[23:08:55] <ajpiano> i said it would be pretty kludgy and inefficient, why do you need to know that
[23:10:39] <MeirD> some parsing website script... i need to find a pattern between an element and the first parent to have a class. and then I need to select all elements in the page who have the same distance from a parent with that same class
[23:10:53] <MeirD> (i know it was not clear)
[23:10:59] <ajpiano> yipes
[23:11:00] <MeirD> but I do need to do it...
[23:11:04] <MeirD> yup :)
[23:11:18] <MeirD> I can create a loop to count the distance
[23:11:25] <GoSox> i'm trying to do a slideUp('slow') but what i'm getting is a slight delay, and then instant disappearance
[23:11:25] <MeirD> thought maybe there is some quick jQuery way
[23:11:40] <GoSox> does slideUp only work in certain situations?
[23:12:00] <ajpiano> var index;  $(this).parents().each( function(i, el) { if (el.className) { index = el; return false };  } );
[23:12:24] <MeirD> damn you're good :) thnx
[23:12:51] <ajpiano> MeirD: you can do it something clever with .index(), but then it requires doing parents() *and* closest and all sorts of pointless trickery
[23:13:31] <MeirD> ok, your solution sounds perfect
[23:13:33] <MeirD> thnx
[23:14:19] <ajpiano> var el = $(el), parents = el.parents(), closest = el.closest("[class]"), index = parents.index( closest[0] ); or something
[23:14:22] <ajpiano> so it's your call
[23:14:48] <MeirD> great, thanks a lot!
[23:32:19] <GoSox> I've got this DIV that is the full width of the page. And it is. But then when I give it an initial style of display: none, and then reveal it with fadeIn(), suddenly it's only 50% width. Without any other changes in my code
[23:32:49] <GoSox> oh crap its because fadeIn changes it to display: block.
[23:33:03] <GoSox> is there any way to change what display type the animated effects animate TO?
