[11:00:55] <Alturic> Hey guys, when storing user input (say they might use html of course) would you store the entities or the actual HTML into a DB? I'm asking because the php crowd was split and it ended up in a heated debate. However I'm having issues working around pulling it via jQuery now.
[11:23:56] <panovia> Alturic: I'd always store the actual Unicode text, that makes it easier to process the data later on
[12:14:58] <andai> so I expected $(document).append() to work the same way as document.write()
[12:15:01] <andai> but i was mistaken
[12:15:08] <andai> looks like i need to use document.body instead
