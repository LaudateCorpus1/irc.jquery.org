[07:20:03] <sine0> hey folks. I want to pay someone to make a small single window form that updates different element inside the form as its completed and then ends up with all the choices in a json data at the end so I can ajax it to my php code. where would be the best place to hire someone to do this for a reasonable price
[07:27:02] <robertmaxrees> lol
[07:27:55] <sine0> robertmaxrees: what you laughing at
[07:28:28] <sine0> I have used upwork before but it seems like alot of bots autobid when you post
[07:30:10] <robertmaxrees> this is a support channel, not a work bid channel.
[07:30:50] <robertmaxrees> i'd suggest looking elsewhere, since this isn't a good spot ;)
[07:31:04] <sine0> yea, but I am not asking in here I am asking where I can get js people, some of you guys might be in the game of gaining work so would have the inside scoop
[07:31:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[07:31:20] <robertmaxrees> take it elsewhere pls :)
[07:31:27] <robertmaxrees> thx'
[07:31:34] <sine0> oh yea im done, but i didnt think it was a stretch
[07:32:00] <robertmaxrees> You aren't asking for help with jQuery - you're recruiting.  Wrong place for that.
[07:33:07] <sine0> yea, guess what. it was the wrong window!
[07:33:30] <robertmaxrees> leave it be :)
[07:33:32] <robertmaxrees> thanks!
[07:34:37] <sine0> why do you keep saying leave it be, im not not leaving it be
[07:34:59] <sine0> tryina flex with your ops, I asked once and it was the wrong channel
