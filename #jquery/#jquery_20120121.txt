[00:04:33] <joshsmith> what easing functions are available in jquery?
[00:06:00] <red_square> ussher_ you can use :lt selector to do less thans
[00:06:43] <Superman_> http://pastie.org/3223608
[00:06:59] <red_square> joshsmith in the core only swing
[00:07:06] <ussher_> red_square: cool, thanks, im not up to that part yet.  the part im stuck on is assigning a value to a div.   i know how to select a class.
[00:07:06] <Superman_> plz have a look. what's the issue. I'm unable to set a single bit in the DB witht this ajax call
[00:07:11] <joshsmith> and linear
[00:09:21] <red_square> the docs are wrong then
[00:09:24] <ussher_> red_square: like <div class="percentage_value_is65">.  and having a bunch of those types of divs. then hiding all the one that are less than the selected.
[00:10:02] <red_square> ussher_ will the divs not be in sequential order?
[00:10:51] <Superman_> http://pastie.org/3223608
[00:10:55] <red_square> ussher_ if you have to give an id I would use a data attribute rather than appending to an id
[00:11:43] <ussher_> red_square: no, not in sequential order.  its orderd by # of matches with the percentage being % of accuracy.  so #1 could have 10 matches but only 50% match.  #2 could have 3 matches but 100% accurate.
[00:12:39] <red_square> use a data atrribute then ussher_ - easier to parse and select
[00:13:04] <ussher_> red_square: i havent seen 'data attribute' before.  thanks, ill go google.
[00:14:08] <red_square> ? .data @ ussher_
[00:14:09] <bot-t> ussher_, .data(key, value): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[00:14:47] <red_square> well specifically this hash http://api.jquery.com/data/#data-html5
[00:17:01] <ussher_> red_square: thanks i found this too: http://www.broken-links.com/2010/11/18/data-attributes-in-html-and-jquery/  and it looks like exactly what i need.  trying to implement it now.
[00:29:15] <Linex> using jqueryui, I find that if I create a dialog closed when the document is ready, then open the dialog with a click of a button, I will not be able to close the dialog by pressing the X on the top right of the dialog.
[00:30:22] <ussher_> red_square: Fantastic!!  got it working thanks to you.  Much appreciated.
[00:30:53] <Linex> I think this has something to do with closure but I did create an object of the created dialog like this var $mydialog = $(#container).dialog();
[00:31:00] <sviatovigt> hi
[00:31:25] <sviatovigt> can someone please explain me in a few words what is the jqXHR object?
[00:32:04] <red_square> ussher_ no probs
[00:33:52] <red_square> sviatovigt it wraps the native xmlhttprequest so jquery can support deferreds
[00:34:31] <sviatovigt> what means deferreds?
[00:35:12] <red_square> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/ sviatovigt
[00:35:19] <disappearedng> Hey how do you actually traverse a javascript object without being affected by the proto and inherited crap

[00:51:52] <px12> anyone here?
[00:51:59] <px12> I have a small problem.
[00:53:54] <px12> I'm on a SuseBox and I'm using chrome as my browser.. and I cannot get .on to work :/ .live works perfectly but I've read about live function and they say its slow.. so.. anyone know how can i get .on to work?
[00:54:41] <px12> I'm on a SuseBox and I'm using chrome as my browser.. and I cannot get .on to work :/ .live works perfectly but I've read about live function and they say its slow.. so.. anyone know how can i get .on to work?
[01:16:25] <red_square> what version of jq px12
[01:22:45] <px12> its 1.7.1
[01:25:36] <px12> let me explain my situation with an example.. i've a page in which when someone clicks some div, it creates a new div with class "xyz" inside a div with class "abc"..  now the already present divs in the parent div show an alert when they are clicked.. i want this for the elements that are added afterwards..
[01:29:13] <px12> red_square?
[01:35:16] <px_> ???
[01:35:29] <datadl> px12: can you make a jsfiddle
[01:36:06] <red_square> sorry px12 was afk
[01:47:29] <px12> sorry guys.. my net disconnecting very often today. :/
[01:47:32] <px12> anyways..
[01:48:01] <px12> so.. who can help me make this work?
[01:51:49] <red_square> ? demo @ px12
[01:52:05] <red_square> px12 - create a jsfiddle with your markup
[01:55:20] <pillar> hi, I have a weird problem.. I call .html("") to a element to clear it and then immediately after that .append("stuff") and sometimes the old content is not cleared, so that the two content are mixed.. is there some timing issue I'm not aware of?
[01:58:42] <leoG> why not doing directly .html('stuff') ?
[02:00:11] <MagePsycho> can you guys recommend some good unlimited scrolling plugin?
[02:00:19] <pillar> leoG: I'm doing many appends in a row and just wanted to be clear it was empty when I start appending
[02:01:20] <pillar> this problem doesn't happen everytime and not locally, it happens mostly if I click really quick to make the changes happen many times.. which makes me think it has something to do with timing
[02:01:40] <px12> http://jsfiddle.net/NNqhr/
[02:01:44] <px12> here's the jsfiddle
[02:01:56] <leoG> pillar : yes but .html('stuff') replace the current content by "stuff"
[02:02:23] <px12> not exactly what i have in my original stuff.. its doing other things.. but this should give you a general idea.. the "x" is not alerting "asasaa" but only "H". :/
[02:03:13] <pillar> leoG: I realize that, it's just that I have a function that does the appending, it would be messy to change it to use html first, then appending later
[02:04:14] <pillar> anyway, need to try it other ways if that would fix it
[02:04:37] <px12> guyss?
[02:09:20] <LordThumper> Hi I am searching for some sort of percentage bar generator plugin, any ideas?
[02:09:49] <red_square> px12 syntax is wrong

[03:42:47] <Linex> Can someone please look at http://pastebin.com/BRS8NrED. Its basic html with jquery(23lines). the dialog cannot close when I click on the X on the top right.
[03:44:24] <Linex> Its is simple but yet not working as expected.
[03:46:36] <px12> http://jsfiddle.net/NNqhr/2/
[03:46:42] <ravenzz> Linex because of the $("a").click(function(){ $myDialog.dialog('open') })
[03:46:52] <ravenzz> Linex http://jsfiddle.net/BYWVg/
[03:47:14] <px12> guys.. on that page.. the divs which are already there do alert "new" but the div which i add later doesn't alert anything :/
[03:48:41] <Linex> ravenzz: you just give an id to the a , thats all the fix ?
[03:48:42] <ravenzz> Linex also <a id="foo" href="#mydialog">Click Here</a> should be more semantic
[03:48:51] <ravenzz> yep and select that
[03:48:57] <ravenzz> id or a class
[03:49:45] <px12> help? anyone?
[03:49:56] <ravenzz> because the closing button is an anchor itself, so when you click it the a handler is being executed
[03:50:25] <Linex> ravenzz: it works. Man! I spents hours wondering why the X would close the dialog.
[03:51:04] <Linex> ravenzz: thank you.
[03:51:22] <ravenzz> you're welcome
[03:52:04] <px12> ..?
[03:52:14] <ravenzz> px12 it alerts as well
[03:52:27] <px12> you can't be serious. :P
[03:52:47] <Linex> actually i meant "... why the X would NOT close the dialog."
[03:52:55] <px12> the "x" one alerts only the "asasaa" message.. not the "new" msg.
[03:52:56] <px12> :/
[03:55:41] <px12> ravenzz?
[03:58:55] <ravenzz> px12 http://jsfiddle.net/NNqhr/3/
[03:59:32] <ravenzz> btw ID and classnames can't start with numbers
[04:01:13] <px12> yeah.. this is just an example... not my real html. :P
[04:01:14] <ravenzz> "The handler is not called when the event occurs directly on the bound element, but only for descendants (inner elements) that match the selector."
[04:02:55] <red_square> px12 I fixed it for you
[04:03:17] <fatih> can u see any errors in http://sudrap.org/paste/text/74936/
[04:05:16] <px12> @red_square: of course you did :) but.. then i had another problem.. i had to select multiple elements and couldn't get it to work with "on". anyways.. now its solved.. thanks everyone! :)

[04:15:44] <croxio5> I've tried a couple things but it doesn't seem to work. Can anyone help?
[04:24:48] <red_square> yup

[04:28:23] <px12> help me! :P
[04:28:28] <ilteris> what's preventDefault() for?
[04:29:31] <px12> you know what.. i converted that js to suit my original html.. and you know what's happening now? :P the js on the fiddle works perfectly.. but it doesn't on my page. :P
[04:29:35] <red_square> ilteris prevents the default action
[04:30:01] <px12> i even copied my exact html and js to fiddle to see if there's some problem in it.. but.. i guess.. something's wrong with my copy of jquery. :P
[04:30:06] <red_square> px12 maybe your markup is screwed
[04:30:35] <ilteris> gotta read more on jquery
[04:30:51] <ilteris> thanks red_square
[04:31:35] <px12> i dont know if that's the case because i write my markup with indentation and.. this editor shows dotted lines and highlighted opening and closing tags.. i dont think so if there's some problem in it.. :/
[04:32:00] <red_square> ilteris preventDefault is not jquery
[04:32:11] <croxio5> red_square, thanks, that's brilliant!
[04:32:13] <ilteris> oh it's not?
[04:32:19] <Linex> Whats the main differences between a <div> and a <p> and a <span>. In most cases, I can use any one of them and the output will be very similar. I think most people then use div most often.
[04:32:26] <px12> ilteris.. its a function from js.
[04:33:56] <red_square> Linex they have semantic meaning - p is for a paragraph of text for instance
[04:34:20] <red_square> ?mdc preventDefault
[04:34:30] <red_square> bot-t
[04:34:32] <red_square> fail
[04:35:10] <Linex> red_square: what about functionality differences?
[04:35:11] <red_square> px12 well then your version of jquery, is your page up on the web?
[04:35:46] <bot-t> red_square, event.preventDefault - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Cancels the event if it is cancelable, without stopping further propagation of the event. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event.preventDefault
[04:35:47] <px12> red_square.. i went through my WHOLE!! ( :O ) webpage.. there's no problem in the html. :/ what to do? :/
[04:35:52] <red_square> linex none really between a p and a div
[04:36:03] <Linex> red_square: ok thanks
[04:36:07] <red_square> px12 - did you validate your page at w3c
[04:36:21] <px12> nope.. i didn't..
[04:36:43] <red_square> ok then it may not be valid, jq works best on a valid page - no duplciate id's etc etc
[04:36:56] <red_square> but without seeing your page, hard to make assumptions:)
[04:37:06] <ilteris> px12 red_square  gotcha:
[04:37:08] <ilteris> W3C has added the method preventDefault() to the event. If you call it the default action is prevented.
[04:38:06] <px12> and my website is on this susebox... and its connected to a free dot.tk domain via dynDNS :P i've disabled anyone accessing the website from outside for now via the configs in apache.
[04:39:10] <red_square> px12 - well open it up and let me av a looK!
[04:40:08] <ilteris> browser coding is not that bad at all at the end of the day :P
[04:40:41] <ilteris> I am starting to like it indeed.
[04:45:25] <croxio5> red_square, how would I go about making the whole body fade in on load? I've tried $(document).load() and $(document).ready() and neither seem to work
[04:55:43] <donCams> ok, i'm passing some html code via ajax http://pastebin.com/B0Y6JkKP
[04:56:29] <donCams> i see that the symbols are converted to some code. can someone inform me what the encoding is so I can decode it in my php?
[04:58:52] <mari00> hi all, anyone around to answer a question, or try?
[05:00:07] <croxio5> Just ask dude.
[05:02:26] <mari00> i'm having a problem with an ajax call to a service called topspin.  here is the code: http://pastebin.com/iZT8yHeb.  i'm getting a "parse error" but i'm not sure what that means.  and not sure how to further debug.
[05:02:41] <red_square> donCams http://php.net/manual/en/function.html-entity-decode.php
[05:09:12] <Mawalu> Ich will das bei meinem code ( http://jsfiddle.net/2nvcT/3/ ) das Icon nicht verschwindet, wenn ich auf der Seite bin, auf die der Link verweist.
[05:09:29] <Mawalu> Also wenn der Link aktiv ist
[05:11:12] <donCams> hmmm... thanks. html_entity_decode, urldecode, htmlspecialchars_decode still doesn't cut it... maybe i should ask php instead :)
[05:12:59] <jaykettu> anyone know why console.log('window location: ' +  window.location.hash); and console.log(window.location); have different value for hash?
[05:13:52] <mari00> has anyone had a chance to take a look at my code re this parse error?  http://pastebin.com/iZT8yHeb
[05:14:00] <mari00> am at a dead end with it
[05:14:04] <sarspazam> I'm using this hover function, but can anyone explain why you need to call function() twice within hover()?
[05:14:06] <sarspazam> http://jsfiddle.net/NjeRE/4/
[05:14:06] <jaykettu> if i set hash2 = window.location.hash.substring(1); it gets the previous value
[05:14:35] <mari00> Mawalu: du hast hier kein link...odern habe ich nicht verstanden?
[05:15:34] <Zogot> sarspazam: the link you gave had no js
[05:15:56] <sarspazam> oh yeah :S one sec
[05:16:10] <sarspazam> http://jsfiddle.net/NjeRE/5/
[05:16:46] <Zogot> Because 1 function is the over
[05:16:51] <Zogot> and the other function is the out
[05:17:23] <Zogot> ?.hover @ sarspazam
[05:17:24] <bot-t> sarspazam, .hover(handlerIn, handlerOut): Bind two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements. http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[05:18:11] <sarspazam> so essentially its just an easier way to write the same funcitons as mouseenter and mouseleave
[05:19:53] <mari00> the german language guy i think wants to kno whether there's a way to check whether a link has been visited with jquery?  is there?
[05:23:02] <Mawalu> I want that at the link where ist activ the icon always be there ( http://jsfiddle.net/2nvcT/4/ )
[05:29:01] <mari00> Mawalu: ich denke, du kannst es schafen, ob du kannst wissen wenn "Home" war schon besucht.  vielleicht diese is hilfreich: http://remysharp.com/2008/02/25/visited-plugin/
[05:30:47] <Zogot> Mawalu: http://jsfiddle.net/zogot/2nvcT/8/
[05:30:48] <Zogot> like so
[05:32:28] <Linex> I specfied show: "slide" for my dialog parameter. But this by default slide it in from the left. Is there an option to make it slide up from the bottom >?
[05:34:18] <px12> hey red_sqaure.. i figured out what was wrong.. i had some older js which used delegate and stuff.. the moment i removed it.. everything was working just fine... and i noticed that.. the selector in $(selector).on("click", "element", func...... needs to be a single one.. why is it so? i mean.. suppose i have many div with classname "abc" inside div with classname "cont".. now every "abc" div had a span inside it.. i want this "abc" div to be removed when i click
[05:34:18] <px12>  the span.. earlier i was using $(".abc").on("click",span... it worked fine with elements which were already present but not with elements which were added later.. so i changed it to $(".cont").on..... and everything worked just fine.. though i still wonder why did they made the on function like this..?
[05:34:30] <mari00> is there a better group on here to discuss ajax requests with?  i'm seriously at a dead end with this ajax request i'm trying to make.  so far i know it is return a http status of 200, but I'm also getting a parse error?
[05:34:59] <px12> mari: can you give me a link to your jsfiddle?
[05:37:48] <px12> mari??
[05:38:10] <mari00> px12: sorry
[05:38:15] <mari00> one sec
[05:38:53] <mari00> http://pastebin.com/iZT8yHeb
[05:41:00] <px12> mari: hey.. tell me something.. are you calling this js from a page that is on "app.topspin.net" or somewhere else?
[05:41:27] <mari00> px12: somewhere else.
[05:41:56] <mari00> in the sense of another site currently on my laptop
[05:42:21] <mari00> here's the jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/FrxeC/
[05:42:50] <px12> umm.. you better start reading pages on ajax in the jquery documentation.. for security reasons.. ajax request can be made to the same server.. that is the server on which your webpage is which has the js in it.
[05:43:07] <px12> **can be made ONLY to the...
[05:44:11] <px12> its called the "same-origin-policy"
[05:46:39] <mari00> px12: not sure i'm following you.  i'm making a simple api call to a server app.topspin.net, as described in topspin's documentation here: http://support.topspinmedia.com/entries/20244386-email-for-media-rest-api.
[05:47:11] <px12> i have a solution for you.. sorry i didn't read your whole js.. but i know what SHOULD work for you.. create a PHP page on the server which has this page with js.. and in that php page.. setup things such.. that you can call it via.. "http://somehost.com/mypage.php?url=yoururl&otherdata=other1&otherdata2=otherdata".. and call this page from your js.. and it should do the trick ;)
[05:48:07] <px12> i've never worked with this api.. and i dont know much about it.. but i know something that is universally true.. i.e. same-origin-policy applies to all ajax calls.
[05:48:15] <px12> still.. lemme look at the page you linked.
[05:49:10] <mari00> px12: i'm sure i'm not understanding the policy, but i don't think i'm calling js on another site.  i'm just making an ajax request that feeds them an email.
[05:49:17] <px12> i dont know if they were in their senses while they wrote that js! :P
[05:49:49] <mari00> well yes they don't make things easy over at topspin
[05:49:53] <px12> they probably thought that you would call this link from withing their server.. which is not the case as i see it..
[05:49:55] <mari00> but Jay-Z uses them so...
[05:50:09] <px12> see.. i'll explain it to you..
[05:50:14] <mari00> ok
[05:50:16] <px12> what you're trying to do here is..
[05:50:45] <px12> you have a website.. for example.. abc.com.. and you have a page in it which has the ajax script in it..
[05:51:49] <px12> and there's this another website which has a page.. for example.. new.com/email.php and when this page is opened.. it gives you a list of email addresses..
[05:51:54] <px12> now here's the catch
[05:52:14] <px12> ajax only allows call made to the same server on which it is hosted..
[05:52:30] <Giverny> http://jsfiddle.net/PCHPZ/ why not run?
[05:53:00] <px12> that is.. if a page on abc.com has a page which ajax script.. it is only allowed to fetch pages from abc.com.. and not new.com.. security reasons :/
[05:53:29] <px12> so.. this is why.. you're not able to make a successful call to this topspin server from you ajax script which is on your own server.
[05:53:37] <px12> i hope you understood this..
[05:53:42] <mari00> ahhh ok.  is this just an abstract policy or something that ajax cannot actually do.  because i've had this working before.
[05:53:58] <px12> what?!?! :O
[05:54:02] <Giverny> mari00 can you help me?
[05:54:03] <px12> you serious?
[05:54:09] <mari00> yes
[05:54:32] <mari00> i swear i'mnot fibbing
[05:54:37] <px12> you actually called a page on new.com from example.com?
[05:54:46] <px12> that cannot happen sweetie :)
[05:54:53] <px12> not from Ajax.
[05:55:08] <_cb> how do I set the .datepicker background color? (Mine, for some reason, is all of a sudden transparent)
[05:56:09] <mari00> px12: it did.  i'm not crazy.
[05:56:14] <px12> its possible via the method i described above.. creating a php page on abc.com which fetches the page from new.com.. and making a call to the php page from ajax which is on the server abc.com.. it should work :)
[05:57:03] <px12> its NOT possible..
[05:57:15] <grantg> What's not possible?
[05:57:24] <px12> security policies cannot be changed according to your wish! :P
[05:57:29] <px12> at least not this one..
[05:57:49] <px12> grantg: calling new.com from abc.com via ajax.
[05:57:51] * grantg just came online, please pardon my lack of scrollback.
[05:57:57] <grantg> px12: oldie
[05:58:16] <grantg> I personally would write a PHP script that proxies the request
[05:58:29] <px12> that's exactly what i told our friend mari00 :)
[05:59:46] <mari00> grantg: iwas following these guidelines...http://support.topspinmedia.com/entries/20244386-email-for-media-rest-api
[06:00:22] <mari00> px12: i get waht you're sayin'; it's just that this actually did work.  i'mm still not clear on if you're saying i *shouldn't* do this or if i *can't*.
[06:00:36] <mari00> i'm open to other methods however...
[06:00:39] <px12> i'm saying you "CAN'T" :)
[06:00:45] <grantg> xmlhttprequest (what jquery and others libs actually wrap around for ajax) isn't always friendly with cross-origin
[06:00:49] <grantg> In fact
[06:00:51] <px12> yeah... the php thing is your best bet :)
[06:01:02] <grantg> old mozilla doesn't even want the domain in the request
[06:01:05] <mari00> ok perhaps you can explain it again...
[06:01:22] <px12> i'll just copy paste it. :P
[06:01:25] <grantg> write a quick cURL script in PHP
[06:01:26] <mari00> but px12, i did have this working.  i have the addresses to prove it ;)
[06:01:34] <grantg> and echo the result
[06:01:42] <px12> <px12> its possible via the method i described above.. creating a php page on abc.com which fetches the page from new.com.. and making a call to the php page from ajax which is on the server abc.com.. it should work :
[06:01:44] <grantg> of course with controls
[06:01:48] <mari00> i'
[06:01:56] <mari00> i'll show you guys the code taht worked.  one sec,.
[06:02:03] <grantg> look into cross-origin ajax
[06:02:12] <_cb> solved. It was the ui.css file.
[06:02:24] <grantg> I seriously don't wanna be solving cross-origin problems at 9 am on saturday
[06:02:31] <grantg> :I
[06:02:33] <px12> haha :P
[06:02:47] <px12> and its almost 7:30pm here. :P
[06:04:02] <px12> "Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://somewebsite.com" ;)
[06:04:33] <mari00> px12: http://pastebin.com/brhZExpw
[06:04:34] <px12> but i dont think you can actually change the pages on topspin.com to send out this header.. can you mari00?
[06:05:54] <grantg> px12: Legacy browser issues though
[06:06:02] <mari00> px12: that's right i can't change anything on topspin.  this is their service for submitting fan emails and allowing those fans to receive a mp3 in return.  i was just followin gtheir guideines in usig ajax.
[06:06:07] <grantg> I use the PHP proxy script for IE 6 compat
[06:06:16] <grantg> IE 6 always makes shit hard
[06:06:38] <grantg> gtg
[06:08:21] <mari00> px12: this page says something aboutusing jsonp to avoid teh same-origin-policy.  perhaps that's how they got this to work?
[06:08:42] <mari00> http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/185506/AJAX-Cross-Origin-HTTP-request
[06:12:50] <px12> i'm sorry i didn't realize i was disconnected.. this is what i posted.. copy paste anything you sent after that..
[06:12:51] <px12> <mari00> px12: http://pastebin.com/brhZExpw
[06:12:51] <px12> <px12> but i dont think you can actually change the pages on topspin.com to send out this header.. can you mari00?
[06:12:51] <px12> * blackice2999 has quit (Quit: Bye!)
[06:12:51] <px12> <px12> okay.. if that did work from a page which was not on topspin.net.. then i guess the "referring_url" make the topspin page sent out the header which i posted here earlier :)
[06:12:54] <px12> <px12> umm.. i dont know about this topspin thing. but i guess.. if this worked.. they probably have someplace in their website where you can add links of pages to their list which are allowed to communicate to them via ajax.
[06:14:42] <px12> mari00: i just read what was in that link.. dont you think its telling exactly what i told you above? :P
[06:15:07] <px12> the topspin server needs to send that access-control header.
[06:15:09] <px12> :)
[06:20:21] <mari00> px12: it is telling me exactly what you said, but it also said taht people have attempted work arounds, right?  and that is i'd guess what the topspin people were doing.
[06:21:08] <mari00> you'll have to forgive me, though, i'm  not fully up to speed on all these network issues.  this is onkly my part time job.  i'm a historian most of the time.
[06:21:11] <mari00> haha
[06:21:28] <mari00> so i'm struggling to follow all the terminology.
[06:21:41] <mari00> i'm trying the php solution you suggested now
[06:24:25] <px12> no no.. the topspin people are not trying to work around with anything of that sort.. what they have given in that example script is not even close to a work around.. its just a simple ajax script from jquery.. nothing else.. they must have forgotten about the same-origin-policy while they were writing that script or as i said earlier.. maybe you have to register your url from which you're calling that page (i.e. your page: abc.com/my.htm) in the topspin server
[06:24:25] <px12> 's database so whenever you make an ajax call to their server.. they send out that access-control header which will allow successful ajax calls :)
[06:25:10] <px12> and hey.. no problem.. even i'm a kid. i'm 16 :P and i'm currently studying in school.. :)
[06:25:26] <mari00> a smart kid then :)
[06:25:34] <px12> hehe :P
[06:25:36] <px12> thank you :)
[06:26:09] <px12> and.. did you find some good tutorial for that php work around? or maybe i can help you find one?
[06:27:02] <mari00> in any case, i think i follow.  could it be that it is the fact that the request url contains identifying ids, ie the topspin artist id and the id of the "campaign", ie the specific promotion for which emails are being collected?
[06:27:16] <mari00> perhaps that allows them to verify?
[06:27:56] <mari00> i don't know.  this is all a bit strange because i used the previous method as i showed you in the paste bin code to do this
[06:28:34] <px12> yeah.. it can be anything.. they could use anything you are sending to them in the call to verify.. and then they could simply send out that header and things WILL work like a charm :)
[06:30:03] <px12> and.. because you're saying it worked.. i guess.. that very ajax call contains some verifying input which helps topspin to verify you and allow you to communicate with them :)
[06:30:13] <mari00> ahhhh but that call has those things!
[06:30:15] <mari00> yes i know that it does
[06:30:17] <mari00> for sure
[06:30:48] <px12> send me the link to that script again.. lemme see if i can find anything of that sort..
[06:31:01] <mari00> http://jsfiddle.net/FrxeC/1/
[06:31:04] <mari00> i can tell you where it is
[06:31:16] <mari00> it's in the source_campaign line
[06:31:43] <px12> and here's a tutorial you can follow while i read it.. http://www.paulund.co.uk/make-cross-domain-ajax-calls-with-jquery-and-php
[06:32:11] <px12> i didn't read it myself though.. but as its title says.. i guess it should do the trick for you :)
[06:33:06] <mari00> ahhh thx... that's what i'm doing now actually.
[06:33:44] <px12> tell me something.. is the server which hosts this "working cross domain" script "http://okgo-redo.extremophile.net" ?
[06:33:49] <mari00> but it is good to see it laid out
[06:34:01] <px12> is this page of yours hosted on http://okgo-redo.extremophile.net?
[06:34:06] <mari00> yes
[06:34:07] <mari00> for the moment
[06:34:13] <mari00> that's just my laptop running a server
[06:35:37] <px12> then i guess that's what is making the topspin server verify you.. i guess it checks the referring_url value.. (if any has been provided) and checks that the request is actually coming from that address and then it matches the list on its server.. and sends out the header.
[06:36:00] <mari00> what i find strange is that when you run the code it says it worked, ie the readystate is 4, but then it also returns a parse error.
[06:36:08] <mari00> nope there's no registration of websites
[06:36:14] <mari00> inside topspin, if that is what you mean.
[06:36:23] <px12> did you mentioned this website of yours somewhere in the topspin website?
[06:36:25] <px12> ohh..
[06:36:43] <mari00> why can't it just verify it based on the fact that you know the correct artistid and widgetid?
[06:36:55] <mari00> which are both included in that line source_campaign
[06:36:59] <px12> something just struck my mind..
[06:37:03] <mari00> ok
[06:37:07] <px12> maybe it doesn't verify anything at all..
[06:37:44] <px12> **MAYBE** it sends out that access-control header everytime that page is requested..
[06:38:01] <px12> and maybe.. you're already able to fetch data from their server..
[06:38:28] <px12> it could be that their server is not giving you a correctly parsed output.. or your page is not able to parse it correctly..
[06:38:33] <px12> lemme check..
[06:38:40] <mari00> this makes more sense to me
[06:38:51] <mari00> it coincides with the fact that i'm getting a parse error
[06:39:00] <mari00> but why would i suddenly not be able to parse the data
[06:39:00] <px12> i checked the url.. it gives out json...
[06:39:05] <mari00> also
[06:39:14] <mari00> there's not really any data returned in this case.
[06:39:38] <mari00> this call just lets them know the new email to add and then they add it to their databases and handle things from there...
[06:39:59] <px12> yeah yeah.. i understand it..
[06:40:44] <px12> wait a minute..
[06:46:22] <Linex> can I make a <span> or a <div> clickable ( to have a click event) ?
[06:52:35] <graphikz> hey.. I was wondering how I could get the CURRENT "settings" or "options" of a function.. i.e. var temp = $("#foo").bar({ test : 0, test2 : 1 });  -- how can I call temp.<settings or options>.test2 ?
[07:03:52] <ph88> i have an <ul> list i want to loop with $.each($('#list'), function() {  });  how do i get the value from each <li> in the list ?
[07:06:21] <millermedeiros> ph88: there are many ways of doing it, I would probably do like:   $('#lists li').each(function(i, el){  $(el).css('background', 'red');  });
[07:06:49] <ph88> thanks
[07:07:21] <px12> heyy.. mari00? you there?
[07:07:25] <px12> sorry i was AFK.
[07:07:36] <mari00> yep
[07:07:43] <mari00> jsut still tyring to get the php method to work
[07:07:45] <mari00> this is all pretty annoying
[07:07:47] <millermedeiros> ph88: depending on you case it might be easier to simply use the .find('li')  http://jqapi.com/#p=find
[07:07:48] <px12> i had a look at the jsFiddle yousent me..
[07:07:56] <mari00> thx
[07:08:17] <px12> and.. i realized that your ajax call is not being completed.
[07:08:48] <millermedeiros> ph88: notice that my example code would be better written as: $('#lists li').css('background', 'red');
[07:08:51] <mari00> are you sure?
[07:09:09] <mari00> it calls the completed function
[07:09:33] <millermedeiros> ph88: but since you wanted to know how to access the "li" elements I assumed you wanted to do more stuff than simply executing one of the jQuery methods over the collection..
[07:10:12] <ph88> millermedeiros:  my code looks like this
[07:10:22] <px12> i mean.. even though it shows readyState as "4".. its doesn't mean that your call is completed.. it just means that the ajax object is ready to send and receive data.. and actually you dont really need to look at this to understand that your call is failing.. because this "readyState" is alerted only when some error occurs in your call according to the script :)
[07:11:00] <ph88> line 12: el --> item
[07:11:58] <px12> and yes.. the .completed script runs.. it runs because it is SUPPOSED to run.. it doesn't matter if the call was successful or not.. the script inside "completed" will run everytime it makes a call. :)
[07:12:22] <mari00> px12: so how do you know it's not completing?
[07:12:35] <px12> the script which should run when a call is successful is inside "success:" :)
[07:13:13] <px12> because the script inside the "error" handler is running everytime we try to make this call
[07:13:18] <millermedeiros> ph88: I didn't received the code, if it is large put it on jsfiddle, pastebin, or any other place, easier to read and to edit..
[07:13:30] <px12> which should not happen if the call was successful :)
[07:13:44] <ph88> millermedeiros:  sorry i forgot to paste the link http://pastebin.com/jXnNHDDz
[07:14:01] <ph88> it's not working though, the array is empty
[07:14:41] <px12> that handler is their to make the script realize that the call has failed and do whatever the programmers wants to do in case an error occurs :)
[07:15:11] <px12> (just a note: its optional to specify this error handler) :)
[07:17:09] <mari00> right
[07:17:18] <mari00> but how can i find out why it is not completing?
[07:17:39] <mari00> all the feedback i can get frmo the error object it seems is parse error
[07:17:39] <px12> by calling the "error" handler :)
[07:17:43] <mari00> which makes o sense
[07:18:01] <mari00> or not to me
[07:18:18] <px12> show me the page you're currently working on.. i'll tell you how to add the error handler in it :)
[07:20:10] <ph88> millermedeiros:  i think $(item).value doesn't give the <li>text</li>   text ...
[07:20:48] <ph88> i'll figure it out ... might be better to do it another way
[07:20:49] <ph88> so thx
[07:20:50] <mari00> i can't it's on my laptop.
[07:21:04] <mari00> no line in
[07:21:17] <mari00> can i search for a tutorial?
[07:21:23] <mari00> i've got an error handler in the cdoe don't i
[07:21:50] <millermedeiros> ph88: you have a couple of errors on that code
[07:22:02] <ph88> what did i do wrong ?
[07:23:12] <ph88> i want to have a numerical value to each <li> so that i can use that instead of the text between <li>...</li>
[07:23:17] <px12> well.. you see that "error: function(xhr, ajaxOptions, thrownError)....." this is the error handler in the script of page you sent me earlier..
[07:23:23] <ph88> perhaps i should used <li id="item1"> or something
[07:24:01] <mari00> yes i know
[07:24:15] <px12> yeah.. so.. you can add this handler in your current script too :)
[07:24:16] <mari00> it's just that i can't seem to get very much information out of those objects
[07:24:30] <mari00> i have those
[07:24:33] <mari00> in there
[07:24:52] <mari00> th jsfiddle code is exactly what i have in my page
[07:25:09] <millermedeiros> ph88: check this  http://jsfiddle.net/QzVHf/
[07:25:19] <mari00> but perhaps i dont' know how to use those objects, but all i can get is that i have a parse error.
[07:25:20] <px12> well.. you know what?
[07:25:40] <mari00> sorry i know that that is the error handler.  i've been using it.
[07:25:50] <mari00> but evidently not very effecitvely ;
[07:26:12] <ph88> oh thx millermedeiros
[07:26:34] <millermedeiros> ph88: so instead of using the `.text()` use `.data('id')`  and do your li like this <li data-id="123">foo</li><li data-id="42">bar</li>
[07:27:08] <ph88> is it valid to have custom attributes ? data-id doesn't seem like a normal attribute
[07:27:16] <px12> just add this line between the part.. "alert("readyState : "+xhr.readyStatus......xhr.status); and alert("responseText: ".....   add this line between these two lines.. alert(thrownError); and it will give you the error thrown by the ajax object.
[07:27:28] <px12> for example.. this script on your fiddle gives this.. "Error: jQuery171037997443741187453_1327159390966 was not called"
[07:27:39] <mari00> yep that's what i got
[07:27:46] <mari00> when i did that
[07:27:55] <px12> hehe
[07:28:07] <mari00> what that means is completely unclear as well
[07:28:08] <px12> so.. tell me.. what kind of error information are you looking for?
[07:28:21] <millermedeiros> ph88: see http://api.jquery.com/data/ very good way to store custom data, better than adding an ID for each element..
[07:28:22] <mari00> something to give me a clue what is going on haha
[07:28:50] <px12> well.. this error means just that.. the call you made to topspin server was not successful. :)
[07:28:56] <ph88> thx a lot !
[07:29:10] <px12> hehehe.. probably doesn't have anything of that sort yet.. :P
[07:29:44] <lind0r> Hey. I would like to make my mysql database table editable in the browser, but not with phpmyadmin but with something that looks like a MS Excel sheet. Is that possible with jQuery?
[07:29:56] <px12> you know.. i already told you.. the php way is the simplest way to do this :)
[07:29:58] <millermedeiros> ph88: jQuery caches those values internally after 1st access so subsequent calls are very fast and don't require updating the attribute itself..
[07:30:05] <mari00> right...i'm trying that now
[07:30:13] <mari00> now trying to debug that
[07:30:16] <px12> how is it going so far?
[07:30:21] <mari00> it doesn't seem to be working either
[07:30:55] <px12> hey... what OS is on the system you're working right now?
[07:31:01] <px12> **working ON
[07:31:26] <px12> actually.. do you have apache installed?
[07:31:39] <mari00> yep apache2 on ubuntu 11.10
[07:31:59] <px12> okay.. and this address.. http://okgo-redo.extremophile.net
[07:32:06] <px12> i'm not able to resolve your ip..
[07:32:13] <mari00> that's on my laptop...that's why
[07:32:32] <px12> yes.. i mean.. that domain points to your ip address.. doesn't it?
[07:32:54] <mari00> i don't have an ip address this is just running inside my local network
[07:33:11] <mari00> hold on
[07:33:16] <mari00> or
[07:33:17] <px12> you're connected to the internet.. aren't you? you HAVE an ip address :)
[07:33:24] <mari00> not a public ip
[07:33:35] <px12> yes you do have a public ip :)
[07:34:10] <px12> go to this website.. whatismyipaddress.com
[07:34:24] <px12> no no.. wait.. you dont need to do that.. :P
[07:34:30] <px12> we're on a IRC. :P
[07:34:45] <px12> i'll just whois you :P
[07:34:56] <mari00> fine fine
[07:35:01] <graphikz> hey.. I was wondering how I could get the CURRENT "settings" or "options" of a function.. i.e. var temp = $("#foo").bar({ test : 0, test2 : 1 });  -- how can I call temp.<settings or options>.test2 ?
[07:35:18] <mari00> i appreciate the help
[07:36:04] <millermedeiros> graphikz: `.bar()` is a plugin right?
[07:36:10] <graphikz> yessir
[07:36:20] <px12> weird.. i cant get your whois info :/
[07:36:23] <millermedeiros> graphikz: depending on the way it was coded you can't retrieve this data
[07:36:25] <mari00> yeah i can't do that either
[07:36:27] <graphikz> px12: his ip is 93.220.119.162
[07:36:35] <px12> thanks.. how did you get that?
[07:36:36] <mari00> yes that's right
[07:36:41] <mari00> yeah how did you do that?
[07:36:54] <graphikz> px12: did you try resolving his hostname?
[07:37:03] <px12> nope
[07:37:34] <graphikz> millermedeiros: hmm.. is there something I can return in the function to return those values - return this.settings for instance?
[07:37:51] <millermedeiros> graphikz: plugins usually store their data as private members, so no way to reach it from outside.
[07:37:59] <millermedeiros> graphikz: did you wrote the plugin?
[07:38:02] <graphikz> nah
[07:38:09] <graphikz> so I'd have to create a getter?
[07:38:46] <graphikz> then do something along the lines of temp.getSettings().test2?
[07:39:04] <millermedeiros> graphikz: maybe it shouldn't be a plugin at all.. I wrote about it a couple yrs ago: http://blog.millermedeiros.com/2010/08/stop-writing-plugins-start-writing-components/    and also a couple wks ago about private varis/functions:  http://blog.millermedeiros.com/2012/01/a-case-against-private-variables-and-functions-in-javascript/
[07:39:05] <graphikz> px12: try that next time.. my client does it for me
[07:39:25] <px12> sweet.. this "xchat" doesn't have that feature i guess.
[07:39:30] <graphikz> os x?
[07:39:36] <px12> anyways.. i nslookedup it and it showed the ip ;)
[07:39:40] <px12> openSuse
[07:39:47] <graphikz> oh ok
[07:39:59] <px12> and hey.. mari... where are you? :P
[07:40:05] <mari00> yep
[07:40:11] <graphikz> millermedeiros: can't wait for the day JS natively supports OOP
[07:40:20] <graphikz> instead of these "hacks"
[07:40:22] <millermedeiros> graphikz: yes you will need to do something like that (a getter) but then it shouldn't be a plugin to begin with, since it won't return an jQuery object it doesn't make sense to have it on the same way as a jquery native method..
[07:40:25] <mari00> wehre am i?
[07:40:31] <px12> yeah.. what's the address of your page in you server?
[07:40:34] <mari00>  located you mean...in the world?
[07:40:37] <px12> **your
[07:40:40] <millermedeiros> graphikz: JS supports OOP it is just different
[07:40:42] <px12> no noo..! :P
[07:40:49] <graphikz> haha I wouldn't call it OOP
[07:40:51] <px12> the page's address :P
[07:40:51] <px12> url
[07:41:02] <graphikz> there are not classes :O
[07:41:04] <millermedeiros> graphikz: it IS oop..
[07:41:07] <mari00> okgo-redo.extremophile.net?
[07:41:11] <mari00> i'm not following you here
[07:41:20] <graphikz> it is but it isn't
[07:41:22] <px12> like.. http://93.220.119.162/url/to/your/page.htm
[07:41:22] <graphikz> it's a mindfuck
[07:41:25] <mari00> oh
[07:41:39] <millermedeiros> graphikz: you don't need classes, you just need objects.. its called Object Oriented Programming, not Class Oriented Programming
[07:41:41] <graphikz> I agree with you because there are objects but it's not REAL OOP
[07:41:45] <mari00> probably /new-okgo?
[07:41:50] <mari00> i'm running this in wordpress
[07:42:20] <graphikz> agree to disagree.. it is what it is in the end
[07:42:23] <mari00> but when i load that public ip in my browser i don't get anything
[07:42:26] <graphikz> I'll read those posts
[07:42:37] <px12> yeah.. found it..
[07:42:38] <px12> http://93.220.119.162/new-okgo/
[07:42:58] <mari00> you can load my site that way???
[07:43:03] <millermedeiros> graphikz: another way to solve you problem (depending on the scenario) is to simply use a reference to the settings object
[07:43:06] <mari00> how come if i neter that it doesn't work?
[07:43:10] <mari00> i'm much confused.
[07:43:34] <px12> so.. as i'm seeing this page.. i realize you've added an entry in your hosts file so you're able to fetch the resources(images and stuff) from your domain "http://okgo-redo.extremophile.net" which points to 127.0.0.1 in your hosts file.
[07:44:02] <px12> "<mari00> how come if i neter that it doesn't work?" what does that mean? o.O
[07:44:23] <millermedeiros> graphikz: but usually jquery plugins doesn't reuse the same object so values may not reflect the actual settings..
[07:44:24] <mari00> sorry enter
[07:44:34] <mari00> i mean when i put in that address i get a 404
[07:44:42] <px12> sorry.. i still didn't get you. :P
[07:44:44] <px12> ohh
[07:44:55] <px12> well.. that shouldn't happen..
[07:44:58] <graphikz> millermedeiros: that's why I was trying to set the object to a variable
[07:45:11] <px12> you sure http://93.220.119.162/new-okgo/ gives you a 404 error?
[07:45:13] <graphikz> millermedeiros: I'll try out your recommendations and see what fits in this plugin
[07:45:18] <graphikz> thanks
[07:45:26] <mari00> oh maybe because i'm call it inside the LAN?
[07:45:54] <graphikz> is the title of that page really Not Found haha
[07:46:08] <px12> ohh right! :P
[07:46:13] <px12> i noticed it right now! :P
[07:46:15] <millermedeiros> graphikz: $.extend({}, deafultOptions, settings)  returns a different object than the one user passed...
[07:46:19] <px12> the title is actually "not found" :P
[07:46:34] <mari00> are you seeing the whole page that way?  i just disconnected my android from the LAN and requested it and it came through but didn't display correctly.
[07:46:47] <millermedeiros> graphikz: so if you have a var pointing to `settings` it may not be the same as the one the plugin actually uses..
[07:46:58] <graphikz> argh JS
[07:47:07] <px12> well.. i know what you're talking about.. you cant see the images and all.. right?
[07:47:24] <mari00> yep
[07:47:26] <mari00> that's how you see it too?
[07:47:31] <mari00> no formatting either
[07:47:34] <mari00> no styles i mean
[07:47:37] <px12> yeah..! :P
[07:47:38] <millermedeiros> graphikz: it is not JS fault, it's jQuery plugins fault.. their design has many flaws
[07:47:38] <graphikz> millermedeiros: so what do you think would be better? a getter or a reference to the settings object?
[07:47:43] <mari00> interesting
[07:48:40] <px12> that's what i told you earlier when i told you that you probably have an entry in your hosts file which make "http://okgo-redo.extremophile.net" point to 127.0.0.1 and that's why you're able to see the images while seeing it on your computer
[07:49:03] <mari00> that is indeed how it is setuup
[07:49:10] <millermedeiros> graphikz: I would avoid plugins if possible and write the code as a component instead, than you can add as many methods as you want and access as many things as you want without cluttering the jQuery namespace
[07:49:24] <mari00> anyway...what was the poitn of all this?
[07:49:25] <mari00> haha
[07:49:45] <px12> do this on your terminal.. "ping okgo-redo.extremophile.net" and tell if it shows up as 127.0.0.1
[07:50:15] <graphikz> millermedeiros: so I should "convert" or "port" plugins into components when possible?
[07:51:04] <millermedeiros> px12 and mari00: I think the problem isn't really a jquery problem, so you don't you guys talk privately?   "/msg px12"  will open a new channel just for you guys..
[07:51:48] <mari00> it is a jquery problem, but we've gone in another direction here.  px12 i'm not sure where this is going exactly...
[07:52:08] <px12> hehehe... we're actually talking about jquery here.. its just that i asked him to show his webpage.. and then.. we went "somewhere" :P
[07:52:22] <mari00> indeed hehe
[07:52:32] <millermedeiros> graphikz: I usually code my stuff as components exactly because of problems like this, it will be more flexible without using weird conventions..
[07:52:57] <mari00> loook i think i need to mess around with this some more and see what i can figure out.
[07:52:58] <px12> anyways.. we'll talk in PM for the DNS Stuff..! :P
[07:53:13] <graphikz> millermedeiros: gonna grab some food.. thanks for all the help and I'll let you know how it goes
[07:53:35] <px12> reply in the pm meri00  :)
[07:54:15] <millermedeiros> mari00 px12: don't want to be rude, just because other msg may get lost in between :D
[07:54:24] <mari00> no worries i understand
[07:55:44] <px12> mari??? millermedeiros isn't being rude.. you are. :P
[07:55:50] <px12> reply on PM. :P
[07:56:52] <mari00> it's not workin
[07:57:27] <SrPx> can I use jquery to select user defined classes, not dom objects?
[07:58:10] <millermedeiros> SrPx: what do you mean?
[07:58:17] <px12> heheheh.. mari00.. you're screwed. :P
[07:58:57] <SrPx> when dealing with javascript classes I often find myself having to write a lot to do basic stuff, for instance, searching for a instance of a class X which has certain member variable defined as Y.
[07:59:07] <mari00> i am sscrewed completel
[07:59:10] <mari00> completley
[07:59:10] <SrPx> I miss being able to just call $("myvar") like I do on jquery
[07:59:15] <px12> heheheh :P
[07:59:25] <px12> what client are you using?
[07:59:34] <mari00> irrsi
[07:59:59] <millermedeiros> SrPx: yeah don't you simply do `myvar.doSomethingAwsum()` ??
[08:00:18] <millermedeiros> SrPx: ops.. "yeah" was supposed to be "why"...
[08:01:06] <SrPx> millermedeiros: no, for instance, I have a class bird and many bird instances. then I want to do something with every bird which speed is higher than 2. I have to make a for loop though all birds and call .dosomethingawesome inside that for
[08:01:08] <px12> is anyone else here using "irrsi"?
[08:02:14] <px12> mari00: anyways.. just do this... /msg px12
[08:02:49] <ajpiano> SrPx: you might want to take a look at some of the js mvc frameworks
[08:03:01] <ajpiano> backbone, ember, etc etc etc
[08:03:13] <ajpiano> then you can have collections of models that you can filter by a property, etc
[08:04:11] <millermedeiros> SrPx: you can't do that with jQuery, the way to do it would be to really loop through an array of objects.. or `filter` the objects based on a rule: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter
[08:04:23] <mari00> px12: that doesn't work
[08:04:31] <mari00> sorry
[08:04:38] <mari00> i think we might need to give up on this for the moment
[08:04:38] <px12> you ARE screwed. :P
[08:04:43] <mari00> my brain is fried
[08:04:47] <px12> haha :P
[08:04:53] <px12> what time is it at your place? :P
[08:04:56] <mari00> thanks for your help
[08:05:00] <mari00> not late
[08:05:04] <mari00> i've just been working on this too long
[08:06:23] <SrPx> millermedeiros: hmm
[08:07:10] <px12> hehe.. well.. i gotta go.. remember.. i'm 16.. so.. I still have to go for dinner when mother calls. :P
[08:07:19] <px12> i'll be back :)
[08:07:38] <px12> till then.. someone else will surely help you.. there are many people in this channel :)
[08:07:41] <px12> see ya

[08:41:25] <Tobbi> Can anyone tell me why the following won't work:
[08:41:31] <Tobbi> eeh, hold on.
[08:43:08] <Tobbi> This is the thing that doesn't work: jsfiddle.net/48KRL
[08:43:21] <Tobbi> The handlers don't get bound to the element, apart from that, everything's fine.
[08:43:27] <Tobbi> The element gets added to the DOM.
[08:48:11] <dabear_> let<3
[08:48:40] <Tobbi> :D Yeah, I like that too.
[08:48:58] <Tobbi> hold on, my mistake. It's bailing out with an internal error message.
[08:49:02] <Tobbi> ouch file not found.
[08:49:58] <dabear_> Tobbi: firefox plugin?
[08:50:11] <dabear_> you know chrome is the shit nowadays :()
[08:50:19] <Tobbi> dabear_: Exactly...
[08:50:49] <Tobbi> dabear_: Well, chrome doesn't allow you to do as much afaik.
[08:50:53] <systemfault> I like both Firefox and Chrome these days ... for different reasons.
[08:50:57] <Tobbi> In terms of customization.
[08:51:16] <dabear_> firefox is the new ie6
[08:51:24] <systemfault> dabear_: Don't exagerate..
[08:51:25] <dabear_> bloatware
[08:51:39] <systemfault> Firefox 9 is fine.
[08:52:04] <Tobbi> dabear_: /me is a former Mozilla intern...
[08:52:10] <systemfault> One of the things I like about firefox is that they care about typography.
[08:52:18] <dabear_> Tobbi: how nice
[08:52:22] <systemfault> Chrome.. doesn't seem to give a shit.
[08:52:43] <systemfault> A bit sad when you think that everything that matters on the web beside pr0n is textual
[08:52:43] <rue> The new releases of Chrome are right about on par with Firefox 9 on general bloat (and speed{

[10:36:22] <FlimFlamMan> hide() and show() appear to not work on elements with absolute positioning.  is there a workaround?
[10:42:41] <EpiphanyG> hello :)
[10:45:28] <EpiphanyG> is it possible to do: $.when(myDeferredObject).then(function (result) { return result; }); ?
[10:45:39] <EpiphanyG> inside a function
[10:46:38] <dilvie> FlimFlamMan: Are you sure they don't work on objects with absolute positioning? Can you create a fiddle test case to prove it? http://jsfiddle.net
[10:53:10] <dilvie> FlimFlamMan: This fiddle proves that hide and show DO work on elements that are absolutely positioned. http://jsfiddle.net/dilvie/4HqJb/
[10:53:55] <FlimFlamMan> dilvie: thanks for the reply - it must have been something else in my code, but if i removed the absolute positioning from my element it worked.
[10:54:06] <FlimFlamMan> i've reworked it a bit and now it works regardless of absolute positioning
[10:55:18] <dilvie> css positioning can be a tricky beast.
[10:56:38] <red_square> EpiphanyG no, not so it returns to the calling func
[10:57:37] <EpiphanyG> ok, thanks, just making sure I wasn't doing something stupid.

[11:15:55] <bjhaid> hi, I am trying to display the next li with a click function, but it keeps showing me something wrong any one can point me to where I can look for help
[11:15:56] <bjhaid> ?
[11:16:37] <snover> not from that description.
[11:25:12] <neataroni> i have some sliding divs that you can only see one of at a time, and i scroll through them with scrollLeft- how do i get them to start already scrolled somewhere?
[11:27:52] <bjhaid> snover: I have a list and I want hide them all and display them with the click on another div, can u point me to cleanest way to get this done, thanks
[11:28:13] <snover> nope
[11:29:35] <bjhaid> snover: can u help out on this then suggestions?
[11:35:07] <systemfault> bjhaid: Perhaps you need a tutorial or something...
[11:35:22] <systemfault> Because it's stupidly trivial to do..
[11:35:52] <systemfault> Anyway.. add a handler to a button that toggles a class on the target list.
[11:36:23] <systemfault> The class would contains something like    display: none;
[11:37:49] <bjhaid> systemfault: I can use append, but since I have hidden the li, I am not sure how to display each of the li, via a loop or however or next
[11:38:07] <qmanjr5> When using http://pastebin.com/J1mjqLw6 to put text into a textfield, how could I use the text from another textfield as the value to add?
[11:38:27] <EpiphanyG> really basic would be to do $('li').hide() on all of them, and then $('theoneyouwanttoshow').show(); in the same action
[11:40:18] <EpiphanyG> qmanjr: to set #area's value to a value from a different text area?  $('#area').val($('#area2').val());
[11:42:34] <qmanjr5> EpiphanyG: And to set #area1s value to #area1 + #area 2 it would be $('#area1').val($('#area1').val()+'#area2'); ?
[11:43:35] <EpiphanyG> not quite
[11:44:05] <EpiphanyG> $('#area1').val($('#area1').val() + $('#area2').val());

[11:55:01] <dddbmt> How do I get the padding of an element as an integer?

[12:03:13] <Putr> hi! Why would this not work: confMapper["save-log"]    = "something"; $.each(mapper, function(key, value) { ..... the console.log in the callback function never get's triggered, but the one after the code block does.
[12:04:07] <EpiphanyG> is mapper defined?
[12:04:32] <systemfault> ?eval var x = {}; x['lol'] = 10; $.each(x, function(y, z) { console.log(y, z); });
[12:04:34] <bot-t> systemfault: "lol" 10{"lol": 10}
[12:04:48] <systemfault> Seems to work..
[12:05:09] <EpiphanyG> confMapper != mapper
[12:06:11] <Putr> 1. mapper is defined (a console.log b4 the function returns an array. 2. the names are different as i'm passing it to a function (1 is from b4 the function, 1 from in the function)
[12:06:33] <Putr> hmmm...
[12:07:15] <EpiphanyG> so the each is stepping through confMapper but a different array?
[12:07:39] <EpiphanyG> *not stepping through confMapper
[12:07:40] <Putr> it's the same array, just passed to function that uses a different (more generic) variable name
[12:07:59] <EpiphanyG> without seeing more code I can't really help then
[12:08:08] <Putr> let me pastebin it
[12:08:12] <EpiphanyG> ok
[12:11:48] <Putr> http://pastebin.com/VknVdujy ... It's ugly code as i'm doing this to lurn web storage
[12:12:30] <EpiphanyG> confMapper needs to be an object
[12:12:43] <EpiphanyG> var confMapper = new  Array() <-- should be var confMapper = {};
[12:13:05] <EpiphanyG> arrays don't suport name value pairs, that's an object.
[12:13:27] <Putr> ye i had a feeling arrays dont support keys... :)
[12:13:53] <Putr> damn.. i have to change the conf keys than
[12:14:40] <Putr> what is better: = new Object(); or = {}; apart from the obvious.
[12:14:48] <EpiphanyG> = {}
[12:15:11] <Putr> why? (i do whant to know :) )
[12:15:32] <qmanjr5> Okay, so I'm using http://pastebin.com/MPKu5X4p to take the value of #area2 and add it to #area1. However, I can't seem to think of an effective way to add <code> to the beginning of it, and </code> to the end of #area2's value before it's added to #area1
[12:16:03] <EpiphanyG> just looks nicer and is smaller to type :D
[12:16:31] <EpiphanyG> with a lot of people dealing with JSON these days it's obvious very quickly what {} is doing
[12:16:41] <EpiphanyG> maybe there is a more official reason :)
[12:16:54] <Putr> no that's a good enough reason :)
[12:17:53] <EpiphanyG> qmanjr5: you mean $('#area1').val('<code>' + $('#area1').val() + $('#area2').val() + '</code>'); ?
[12:18:01] <qmanjr5> Ohhhh
[12:18:13] <qmanjr5> Very nice.
[12:19:05] <qmanjr5> ONE more question. Is there a simple way to escape special characters through JS or JQ? I've searched, and the easiest way I canf ind, it seems, is using a function to change them all manually.
[12:19:11] <qmanjr5> There's no built-in one?
[12:20:17] <EpiphanyG> there are built in functions like this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.escape
[12:20:23] <EpiphanyG> and the unescape() method
[12:20:34] <qmanjr5> EpiphanyG: Doesn't that code send <code> to #area1, then take #area1s value, then </code>?
[12:21:07] <qmanjr5> So it would add <code> to the very beginning of #area1, no?
[12:22:07] <EpiphanyG> it would change #area1's value to "<code>Value of Area1Value of Area2</code>"
[12:22:19] <qmanjr5> alright.
[12:22:25] <qmanjr5> It's a simple matter to rearrange that.
[12:22:26] <EpiphanyG> is that what you wanted?
[12:22:46] <qmanjr5> No, I needed <value of area1> <code> <value of area2> </code>
[12:22:48] <qmanjr5> but I can change it :P
[12:22:51] <EpiphanyG> ah ok ;)
[12:23:10] <EpiphanyG> just remember that .val() returns a string, and all you're really doing is connecting strings together
[12:23:21] <qmanjr5> And that window.escape doesn't change the symbols to HTML characters. They would read as the hex numbers, wouldn't they?
[12:24:37] <EpiphanyG> it might be less confusing to set val area1 = $('#area1').val(), area2 = $('#area2').val(); and then just using $('#area1').val(area1 + "<code"> + area2 + "</code>"); just makes it less confusing
[12:25:14] <EpiphanyG> qmanjr5: yep, you'll probably need to write your own function / regular expression if you want to do specific changes like that
[12:25:16] <qmanjr5> Good idea.
[12:25:24] <qmanjr5> Alright, thank you.
[12:25:41] <EpiphanyG> not "val area1 =" but "var area1=" :$
[12:25:49] <EpiphanyG> typo :D
[12:25:55] <EpiphanyG> too many val's running around.
[12:25:58] <qmanjr5> :P I get what you mean
[12:26:06] <qmanjr5> wait
[12:26:10] <qmanjr5> does thst space matter?
[12:26:19] <EpiphanyG> which space?
[12:26:32] <qmanjr5> You changed "val area1 =" to "var area1="
[12:26:37] <qmanjr5> Look at what you just said. :P
[12:26:40] <EpiphanyG> haha another typo :D
[12:26:46] <qmanjr5> lmfao
[12:27:03] <qmanjr5> Don't worry, I get exactly what you mean
[12:27:10] <EpiphanyG> best to always have spaces between "=" and "+" mostly for readability sake
[12:27:19] <qmanjr5> Ah
[12:28:04] <EpiphanyG> I'm used to using Skype at work where I can correct lines :D
[12:29:06] <qmanjr5> Heh
[12:29:18] <qmanjr5> I'm using irssi right now. :P Very confusing.
[12:35:59] <qmanjr5> Hey EpiphanyG, if I were to make a function called escapeChars to change all the special characters to their HTML equivalent, how would I use that in what you said above?
[12:36:59] <EpiphanyG> you could put it in the var declaration... var area1 = escapeChars($('#area1').val());
[12:37:02] <chealer> is there anything wrong with Trac bug tracker? how can I add an attachment (to http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/11205 )?
[12:37:11] <qmanjr5> var area2 = escapeChars($('#area1').val() ?
[12:37:15] <EpiphanyG> yep
[12:37:24] <qmanjr5> Was looking up, didn't see you sent that. :P
[12:37:28] <EpiphanyG> :D
[12:37:37] <qmanjr5> Just making srue I had the proper syntax in that
[12:38:05] <qmanjr5> Just so I'm clear as to the understanding of the correlation between Javascript and JQ; the code after $ is JQ, right? And the stuff before is JS?
[12:38:21] <crashev> hello I do $.post(..., 'json', function(jsonRESPONSE) {}); however if data returned by web server is not json then function() is not called, why? I would like in such case throw an error.
[12:39:03] <aro> is there a way that when calling $.ajax you can see what line of code it came from? instead of saying line 4 in jquery.js
[12:39:06] <EpiphanyG> yes qmanjr5
[12:39:16] <qmanjr5> Fantastic. Thanks for all your help. :)
[12:39:21] <EpiphanyG> no problem :)
[12:39:29] <EpiphanyG> but it's all javascript really
[12:39:50] <qmanjr5> Well yeah
[12:42:03] <aro> also, is there a way to tell if a particular binding has been set using .live
[12:43:23] <tash> tash
[12:43:26] <tash> argh
[12:43:33] <EpiphanyG> crashev, take a look at the parameters you can use here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/
[12:44:24] <LordThumper> Can Javascript from within an iframe access the iframe tag's attributes?
[12:44:32] <EpiphanyG> it says here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.post/ what jQuery.post is shorthand for, you can use .ajax with more options
[12:44:38] <crashev> EpiphanyG: is there a way to tell if data returned by the server is json parsable data ?
[12:45:01] <tash> attempting to use jquery ui modal form ... firebug is complaining about imanges not found when I click on my button to open the modal...and the modal disappears without any human interactions. So, 1) is it disappearing b/c I'm missing images?  and 2) I don't know where to get the images ... like this one: images/ui-bg_glass_75_dadada_1x400.png
[12:45:05] <EpiphanyG> if you get data back then it's parsable :D no idea really, not my speciality
[12:45:09] <crashev> EpiphanyG: yes, I did a simple ajax search and then tryed jquery.parseJSON() but if data is not json it crashes
[12:45:09] <tash> anyone able to offer some assistance?
[12:45:25] <crashev> EpiphanyG: i will try some more then ;]
[12:45:32] <WesleyL> tash: they're included in the ui download
[12:45:44] <tash> hmm
[12:46:35] <WesleyL> the folder with the css file has a subfolder img
[12:46:40] <EpiphanyG> crashev I usually look in firebug to see if there is anything in the net tab when trying to debug ajax calls
[12:46:42] <WesleyL> or images
[12:46:43] <systemfault> crashev: Take a look at the documentation on the jqXHR object, it shows how to add a "fail" handler
[12:47:41] <systemfault> crashev: The post function was... I guess.. written by a beginner.
[12:47:42] <tash> WesleyL: ok, I'll go find them and put them where they should be
[12:47:55] <tash> but, does that explain why the modal opens and immediately closes?
[12:48:14] <tash> I click my button, see it pop up, then it hates me and disappears for some reason
[12:50:15] <EpiphanyG> LordThumper: is it from within the same domain?
[12:51:55] <EpiphanyG> LordThumper, try this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4689145/pass-jquery-variables-between-iframe-and-parent
[12:52:30] <aro>  is there a way to tell if a particular binding has been set using .live
[12:54:01] <EpiphanyG> aro, within javascript? or do you just want to see what events are bound for debugging purposes?
[12:55:05] <EpiphanyG> aro, to see what events are bound on a page, I use this: http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/article/Visual+Event+2
[12:55:28] <EpiphanyG> but if you need to programmatically check if something is bound, someone else might be able to offer an opinion, I don't know
[12:58:42] <aro> ok thanks
[13:18:09] <shadykhan> i was just wondering as a front end dev what should i start learning after html,css,js,jquery?
[13:18:32] <Eviltwin> After those?
[13:18:39] <shadykhan> yeah
[13:19:03] <dabear_> learn brainfuck
[13:19:34] <Eviltwin> Its by far the most useful language you can learn
[13:22:07] <EpiphanyG> node!
[13:41:08] <neiz> hello, I'm using jQuery to basically turn a list of img's into a slideshow. However, intially, on page load, all the images are spread out - then they compact themselves.  Can I make it so the user does not see this?
[13:47:46] <EpiphanyG> neiz: without knowing what plugin/code you're using for the slideshow it's hard to give any advice. Maybe have all images as hidden until the JS is ready?
[13:51:16] <neiz> EpiphanyG: Thanks for the response; I am using .cycle() for the images (jquery.malsup.com/cycle) and code is code is http://pastebin.com/0U8cPKmd
[13:54:42] <EpiphanyG> I'm not sure, maybe try hiding all of them except the first
[13:56:13] <EpiphanyG> neiz, ah yes, in the faq here: http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/faq.html
[13:56:25] <EpiphanyG> #slideshow img { display: none } #slideshow img.first { display: block }
[13:57:22] <neiz> EpiphanyG: sorry i missed that, thanks a lot :) fixed the issue perfectly
[13:57:29] <EpiphanyG> no problem :)
[14:14:40] <Giverny> i need help with jquery plugins anyone?
[14:16:14] <EpiphanyG> Giverny: you're more likely to get a response if you explain what the problem is
[14:17:11] <Eviltwin> ?ask @ Giverny
[14:17:16] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[14:17:31] <Eviltwin> "Don't ask to ask, just ask your question"
[14:23:29] <Engin> can I temporarily suspend event handlers of an element ?
[14:23:44] <Engin> i.e. i want to call .focus() on an element but not trigger the event handlers for that particular triggering
[14:27:36] <Eviltwin> Engin: Use the trigger data
[14:28:08] <Eviltwin> Do something like .focus(function(event, ignore) { if(ignore === true) return; ... });
[14:28:25] <Eviltwin> Then .trigger("focus", true) when you want it to be ignored
[14:30:46] <Engin> Eviltwin: sounds good
[15:09:10] <Roots47> Hey guys... I'm getting $('.basic_information_ajax').html(data.message).delay(1000).fadeOut('slow'); is not a function when trying to execute this on a successful ajax request.  Not sure what I'm overlooking.  Any ideas?
[15:13:30] <Roots47> Nevermind, I wasn't specifying that the return type would be json
[15:25:34] <dnsdds> Is there a clear way to set the selected option of a <select> based on its text, not its value?
[15:28:17] <fris> dnsdds .text()
[15:28:50] <fris> example $("#list option:selected").text();
[15:32:02] <Giverny> var self = this; this.efeito.call(filtro(0, 3)); how i make this?
[15:32:27] <Giverny> have a call for methods in jquery?
[15:38:08] <imsky> pom bam bom
[16:02:42] <nicholasschulz> Why does the two spans show when not the right fields are clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/nicholasschulz/86Bd3/
[16:08:20] <io> hi, first posting here, i am using a div element to trigger a jquery event (show some content) but this is no fallback proof, how do i go to use a real menu link that is disabled if java script is enabled, so that i can use it to load the content via jquery?
[16:16:29] <Giverny> don`t have help in this channel?
[16:23:36] <theBrettman_> hasClass() returns a boolean, right?
[16:25:26] <sonotos> yes
[16:25:34] <dnsdds> How can I set which option is selected in a <select> based on the text, not the value?
[16:26:17] <sonotos> each + text() == 'value'
[16:26:36] <theBrettman_> so if I wanted not include something if it does have the class, will it work? cuz it's not: http://jsfiddle.net/theBrettman/UHGUC/15/
[16:27:08] <theBrettman_> I put if (!$('#canvas').hasClass('selectedElement'))
[16:27:32] <theBrettman_> but it still does it anyway when canvas has class selectedElement
[16:29:04] <theBrettman_> nvm
[16:29:12] <theBrettman_> I put it on the wrong damn function, lol
[16:37:59] <Tobbi> Is there a way to have a jquery UI autocomplete list without a textbox? (something that I can feed with data on my own?)
[16:42:18] <io> hi i am using a div element to trigger a jquery event (show some content) but this is no fallback proof, how do i go to use a real menu link that is disabled if java script is enabled, so that i can use it to load the content via jquery?
[16:54:02] <nicholasschulz> io: use <a href=''><div id='yourDiv'></div></a> … Then you use event.preventDefault(); do disable the redirection if JS is enabled...
[16:54:34] <io> nicholasschulz: thanks I ll have a look at it
[16:55:42] <nicholasschulz> make sure you detect if the <a id='someId'> is clicked, not the div.. like this : $('#someId').click ( function () { event.preventDefault(); // DO SOMETHING});
[16:55:51] <nicholasschulz> @io
[17:04:13] <io> nicholasschulz: http://pastebin.com/B1vV24sp this should unable all my .leaf right?
[17:04:23] <io> *disable
[17:04:54] <io> ok sorry there was a mistake
[17:27:29] <jferg> hello
[17:27:51] <jferg> I am trying to use a download link to trigger an ajax action
[17:28:00] <jferg> which I got to work by setting 	jQuery.ajaxSetup({async:false});
[17:28:06] <jferg> got to work in FF
[17:28:11] <jferg> doesn't seem to work in chrome
[17:29:03] <snover> jferg: do *not* set async false.
[17:29:05] <jferg> the download get is cancelled
[17:29:05] <jferg> is there a better way to download a file and trigger an ajax action at the same time?
[17:29:08] <snover> ?async @ jferg
[17:29:15] <snover> ugh, bottttyyyy
[17:29:37] <jferg> do not OK. so I guess there is a better way
[17:29:48] <jferg> before I did that, the ajax action was being canceled adn the download was working
[17:31:34] <jferg> snover why do you say do not set async false?
[17:31:46] <snover> I’d let you know if the bot was working. The short version is it causes the browser to hang.
[17:31:56] <jferg> I see
[17:33:10] <jferg> no thoughts on a better way to make a link trigger a file download and an ajax action at the same time?
[17:34:43] <dabear_> man, I got a dig bick!
[17:40:01] <detaos> hello everybody
[17:41:42] <detaos> document.getElementById("tag_id") == $("#tag_id") ... yes?
[17:42:30] <jferg> I just found something simliar yeah

[17:42:32] <jferg> thanks
[17:43:56] <digital-ghost> Hi all, new to jquery/programming. Just created a pagination script that removes the next and back 'buttons', but because these buttons are being added dynamically I am losing the binding to the 'back' button. No event handler is attached to it.
[17:44:08] <digital-ghost> Is there a common reason or function I should be using in order to correct this?
[17:44:29] <Matiasu_> Hello
[17:44:39] <Matiasu_> is there a selector to match the PREVIOUS sibling?
[17:44:52] <Matiasu_> I know there's one for the next but what about the previous?
[17:45:58] <dabear_> detaos: those to statemetns select the same elements, but they are not completely equal
[17:46:11] <dabear_> ?prev @ Matiasu_
[17:46:40] <Matiasu_> dabear_, it seems it doesn't work
[17:47:08] <dabear_> Matiasu_: maybe you want prevuntil
[17:47:16] <detaos> dabear_: when i use `document.getElementById` the code works, but when i use `$` any function calls attached to the object fail.
[17:47:18] <Matiasu_> let me see
[17:48:01] <dabear_> detaos: the first is a dom element, the second is a jquery object. they have different function calls
[17:48:20] <dabear_> or, methods as it's usually called
[17:48:49] <detaos> ah, so the jquery selector can't call the dom object functions?
[17:50:10] <Matiasu_> dabear_, yep, thank you!
[17:54:54] <Tobbi> Can anyone tell me why the select event on this autocomplete is not firing? http://jsfiddle.net/hTjyL/
[17:57:17] <Tobbi> ...and maybe why the title attribute is not taken into account?
[17:57:34] <Tobbi> (in the custom _renderItem function
[18:22:50] <oojacoboo> so, curious how people typically handle the situation where you have a list and the ability to add additional list items
[18:23:12] <oojacoboo> do you put the html in the js or do you grab the content of the previous list item and duplicate it?
[18:23:25] <oojacoboo> minus any input values of course
[18:25:07] <Matiasu_> suppose I have $('div:first p'), can I get a plain array from this?
[18:25:36] <oojacoboo> huh?
[18:25:43] <oojacoboo> wouldn't that be first-child too?
[18:26:36] <Matiasu_> no, it's "all <p> within the first <div>"
[18:26:39] <Matiasu_> oojacoboo
[18:27:23] <oojacoboo> yes, first-child
[18:27:28] <oojacoboo> div:first-child p
[18:27:35] <oojacoboo> at least with css, jquery might accept both
[18:28:02] <oojacoboo> While :first matches only a single element, the :first-child selector can match more than one: one for each parent. This is equivalent to :nth-child(1).
[18:29:08] <oojacoboo> Matiasu_: so in that case it will only match that one div p once
[18:29:11] <oojacoboo> in the entire DOM
[18:29:17] <raj> can someone tell me why this line--> $(".autocomplete").wrap('<div class="autocomplete_div"><ul class="autocomplete_list"><li class="autocomplete_textbox"></li></ul></div>'); causes http://68.44.194.145:8080/asdf/edit-profile?section=occupation . Company and Position should have textboxes, not red dots
[18:29:29] <Matiasu_> I just want <p>s withing the FIRST (only one) <div>
[18:29:32] <oojacoboo> whereas with first-child, it would match all first div elements with a p
[18:29:44] <oojacoboo> Matiasu_: :first it is then
[18:29:47] <Matiasu_> it's not the idea. the question is, how do I get an array from a jQuery object?
[18:30:23] <oojacoboo> Matiasu_: $.makeArray() ?
[18:30:34] <Matiasu_> lets see if it works, thanks
[18:30:43] <oojacoboo> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.makeArray/
[18:30:45] <Matiasu_> yeah, thanks
[18:35:08] <raj> no takers?
[18:36:55] <oojacoboo> raj: it's b/c you suck at css
[18:37:25] <oojacoboo> why are you using position: absolute; ?!?!
[18:37:53] <oojacoboo> I'm sorry, but that really pisses me off
[18:38:06] <oojacoboo> if you're going to try and do layout, learn how to use css
[18:38:40] <gao> how how do i remove the last li of an ol
[18:39:14] <oojacoboo> $("ol li:last-child").remove();
[18:39:57] <oojacoboo> I'm not even all that good with jquery, it must be noob night around here
[18:42:19] <raj> oojacoboo, position absolute so it doesn't shift the other elements
[18:42:31] <oojacoboo> raj: no
[18:42:35] <oojacoboo> incorrect
[18:42:38] <oojacoboo> not even close
[18:42:41] <raj> then?
[18:43:07] <oojacoboo> use padding properly and negative margins if you need to add a border
[18:43:26] <oojacoboo> so, border: 1px solid red; margin: -1px;
[18:43:42] <raj> that border is just there temporarily
[18:43:50] <oojacoboo> yes, I understand
[18:43:52] <raj> but what about the fact that the <li>'s will populate
[18:43:58] <raj> and the div will stretch
[18:44:06] <oojacoboo> will populate what what?
[18:44:18] <raj> therefore, the div is position relative...and the ul is position absolute
[18:44:21] <gao> how do i add something to the beginning of the <li> ?
[18:44:26] <raj> it's an autocomplete script
[18:44:26] <gao> i mean <ol>
[18:44:46] <oojacoboo> gao: when are they populating?
[18:44:56] <oojacoboo> you aren't loading in your list items on page load?
[18:45:06] <raj> they are populating on keypress and focus
[18:45:15] <oojacoboo> text inside the input?
[18:45:19] <raj> yes
[18:45:23] <oojacoboo> so what?
[18:45:28] <oojacoboo> why does that matter?
[18:45:47] <raj> because if i don't have position:absolute at least somewhere, it starts pushing other elements around
[18:46:43] <oojacoboo> raj: the input shouldn't be inside the autocomplete list container
[18:46:54] <oojacoboo> they should share the same parent, but be siblings
[18:47:31] <raj> oojacoboo, but that wouldn't change what's happening
[18:47:42] <raj> oh, yes, it would
[18:47:54] <raj> but even still, position:absolute would still be needed
[18:48:01] <oojacoboo> yes, for an autocomplete list
[18:48:04] <oojacoboo> that's proper
[18:50:38] <raj> ok, then what's with getting mad about using it? :)
[18:51:27] <oojacoboo> raj: well, I didn't understand what you were doing, so that's partially my fault, but you still had position: absolute; attached to your input
[18:51:34] <oojacoboo> which is ridiculous
[18:51:41] <raj> no, position absolute was on the ul
[18:51:48] <oojacoboo> and the input was in it
[18:51:52] <raj> right
[18:51:55] <oojacoboo> right
[18:52:11] <raj> k
[18:52:12] <raj> :)
[18:53:14] <gao> is there a way i can add an element at the start instead of .append() ?
[18:53:24] <oojacoboo> prepend
[18:54:07] <gao> err.... will that let me add an <li> at the front of an <ol>

[20:29:55] <tash> I was in here earlier and asked for some help...had to walk away and lost my session. So, not sure if anyone offered assistance.  I don't understand my this jqui modal form that is popping up when one of my buttons is clicked just disappears.  I click the button, it shows up for a split second and leaves.
[20:34:07] <tash> hmm, it doesn't automagically disappear in IE, but does in FF
[21:13:43] <tash> anyone around?
[21:40:51] <civilordergone> does anyone know if. launching jquery.load() multiple times
[21:40:58] <civilordergone> if it clears what's loaded before
[21:42:07] <coldhead> it shouldn't
[21:42:14] <coldhead> that would be rude
[21:42:31] <civilordergone> it would be rude
[21:42:32] <civilordergone> and cruel
[21:42:34] <civilordergone> and unusual
[21:42:53] <civilordergone> the only reason why i'm asking is cause i had it loading every second
[21:42:58] <civilordergone> and it eventually crashed the page or something
[21:45:35] <coldhead> memory leak?
[21:57:37] <civilordergone> coldhead: it's not crashing anymore
[21:57:52] <civilordergone> i have no idea what was wrong with it.
[21:58:05] <civilordergone> my only guess is that 1 second buffer inbetween updates wasn't enough time
[21:58:08] <civilordergone> for it to clear the garbage
[21:58:19] <civilordergone> then the garbage man was like."HEY IM THROWING THIS ALL AWAY"
[22:28:14] <ilteris> hey guys, why do I get null when I do this on this website? it's a selector, basically a div class. but I get null when I try to trace it: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2070808/Screenshots/2m.png
[22:29:23] <ilteris> ugh I guess I need to have jquery imported, correct? :)
[22:41:10] <tash> if I create a <div>, can I do this if my div has id of new-button? $( "#new-button").html( "<input type=\"submit\" rel=\"recordId\" id=\"recordId\" value=\"Submit\" />" );
[22:41:52] <systemfault> tias :/
[22:42:58] <tash> well, I did actually ... so maybe my question wasn't the right question ... lemme re-ask
[22:45:25] <tash> I did that, and the button is submit button is created.  I want to set the id to be the value of a particular variable.  So, var recordId = $( this ).attr( "rel" ); happens to be the var I want to set as the submit button's id ... if I alert(recordId); it is something like 12371.  I want the id of that new submit button to be that value ... or set the rel to that value. Hope I'm making sense.  I can't tell if I'm literally setting the id to "rec
[22:45:49] <tash> I did that, and the submit button is created is what that first sentence should read ... jeez
[22:50:47] <Mayank1> Hi i want to post to a PHP file, without waiting for response. How can I do it?
[22:56:45] <donCams> $.ajax({url:url, type:'POST', data:data});
[23:00:11] <hendry> newbie question: instead of $('#cam').append(this);, how do I set $('#cam') = this; ?
[23:01:24] <donCams> wut?
[23:03:49] <hendry> I want to set $('#cam') innerHTML to an Image object
[23:03:51] <Soopaman> if I have an array of values that act as the value keys to an object, is it possible to .call the entire array without traversing, or eval'ing a dynamically built string?
[23:04:09] <neataroni> is there a way to have an opacity mask that varies in opacity over time?
[23:05:17] <donCams> then just append the <img />
[23:05:50] <hendry> donCams: but there is an image there already i don't want. Do i need to clear beforehand?
[23:06:04] <donCams> Soopaman, do you mean $(obj).each(function() {} ); ?
[23:06:48] <donCams> neataroni, setInterval?
[23:07:21] <neataroni> donCams: perfect, thank you
[23:07:31] <donCams> hendry, then you need $('#cam').html('<img src="">');
[23:07:46] <tash> I'm struggling here.  Can someone look at this pastie? http://pastie.org/3229054  I want to set the id on my button on line 15 of the pastie to the value of the variable on line 4 ... what am I doing wrong?
[23:08:00] <Soopaman> donCams: no something more along the lines of [ "magical", "key", "function" ] would be the path to obj[ "magical"]["key"]["function"].call()
[23:08:09] <donCams> document.getElementById('cam').innerHTML = '<img src="">';
[23:08:12] <Soopaman> but in one fell swoop without eval'ing
[23:08:20] <systemfault> Lulz...
[23:08:30] <tash> fwiw, if I console.log recordId in that first function, it definitely logs the right thing.
[23:08:33] <systemfault> Advising innerHTML in #jquery...
[23:08:37] <hendry> donCams: ah, thanks
[23:08:42] <systemfault> .html() KTHX.
[23:08:57] <donCams> systemfault, look at previous posts
[23:09:07] <donCams> i'm merely providing him with options :3
[23:09:18] <systemfault> Ah ok :D
[23:09:47] <systemfault> Anyway... innerHTML has some edge cases that must be taken care of... better use .html all the time.
[23:10:37] <tash> but when I do that alert on line 19 of my pastie, it alerts [object]
[23:10:39] <tash> I'm confused
[23:11:03] <tash> does my dialog() not know what that var is then?
[23:11:24] <systemfault> tash: Don'T use alert.. only idiots do that..
[23:11:34] <systemfault> tash console.log is your best friend ever.
[23:11:35] <donCams> put var recordId before line 1
[23:12:01] <donCams> not a js expert, but it seems to have something to do with var scope
[23:12:44] <tash> systemfault: the dialog() isn't working in FF or Chrome, but is in IE, that's why I'm alerting
[23:12:47] <hendry> is $images.eq(current) the same as $images[current] ?
[23:13:06] <donCams> why use it if it's not working on FF or chrome?
[23:13:08] <donCams> ugh...
[23:13:10] <tash> and donCams: not sure putting it before line 1 makes sense ... I'm setting the recordId to be the rel of the button I'm clicking
[23:13:32] <tash> I haven't looked into why broken in ff or chrome...and the client uses IE
[23:14:07] <donCams> http://pastie.org/3229090
[23:14:14] <donCams> or remove var to make it a global variable
[23:14:23] <tash> k
[23:14:24] <tash> trying
[23:14:34] <donCams> if you call it inside function() {} it will be local
[23:14:36] <LukeNukem> hello can someone help me in ajax?
[23:15:12] <systemfault> Ajax is a nice bathroom cleaner :/
[23:15:20] <LukeNukem> true true
[23:15:33] <LukeNukem> i gotta make facebook like buttons so yeah i need to use ajax :|
[23:15:39] <tash> donCams: now it alerts "undefined"
[23:15:40] <tash> :P
[23:15:41] <LukeNukem> to process php scrips without realoding
[23:15:45] <tash> argh, I should just go to bed
[23:16:32] <neataroni> can i animate .css({ opacity: 0.5 })?
[23:17:01] <donCams> .animate({ 'opacity':0.5});
[23:17:11] <neataroni> whoops, i guess i should just use fadeto
[23:17:25] <donCams> well, animate gives you more control. hehe
[23:22:01] <neataroni> why isnt setInterval showing up in the docs?
[23:22:32] <dr0id> its not a jquery feature
[23:22:45] <donCams> it's native JS
[23:23:06] <neataroni> oh
[23:24:53] <neataroni> woah, i cant fade whilst animating a scrollLeft?
[23:25:10] <donCams> you can... :3 use animate
[23:25:39] <neataroni> donCams: but what if i want them to be decoupled
[23:25:53] <donCams> decoupled? i'm sorry, english isn't my native language
[23:28:46] <neataroni> donCams: no prob- i want to hit one button to fade, and another to scrollLeft
[23:54:38] <theBrettman> is it possible to make the content of a ui-dialog in the code instead of making html for it
[23:57:59] <LukeNukem> theBrettman, tes
[23:58:00] <LukeNukem> yes*
[23:58:33] <donCams> theBrettman, build the string for it :3
[23:59:38] <LukeNukem> theBrettman,
