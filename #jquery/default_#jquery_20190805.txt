[13:32:23] <royalty> hello, i came on looking for some advice
[13:32:43] <robertmaxrees> what's up?
[13:33:10] <royalty> i'm to build a loooong form, with a lot of different form data to be posted, however, i want there to be sections within that form that are submitted via ajax
[13:33:21] <royalty> what's the best way to structure something like this?
[13:33:30] <robertmaxrees> structure how?
[13:33:48] <robertmaxrees> and why break it into small chunks?  how big is this form?
[13:34:53] <royalty> so basically i'll use my real example <form> <card> <patient_details> <patient_finder_ajax></card> <card><services></card> <dropzone> </form>
[13:34:59] <royalty> well
[13:35:02] <robertmaxrees> :|
[13:35:09] <royalty> an abstract concept of the real example i suppose, my bad
[13:36:30] <royalty> i feel like my brain is working at half capacity, stupid question, is it possible to post multiple forms at once?
[13:36:54] <robertmaxrees> via ajax, yes.  via non-ajax, no.
[13:37:11] <royalty> i see, i was hoping to be able to post a bunch of forms without ajax
[13:37:29] <royalty> or just figure out the best way to get this big form going with the right structure
[13:38:04] <robertmaxrees> why do you think breaking it into smaller chunks is what you want?
[13:38:22] <royalty> basically in a couple areas there is a modal where ajax submissions are going to go through, but it's within the bigger form structure, but i also have a dropzone, which has to be it's own form i think
[13:38:42] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:38:50] <royalty> i mean, i don't mind one big form but HTML-wise it doesn't feel feasible
[13:38:59] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:39:00] <robertmaxrees> lo
[13:39:02] <robertmaxrees> *lol
[13:39:11] <royalty> because like i said i need a dropzone in there
[13:39:20] <royalty> which i believe requires its own form
[13:39:20] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean you need a separate form necessarily.
[13:39:42] <robertmaxrees> depending on how you want it to behave, you could leave it as apart of the larger form.
[13:39:58] <royalty> and then there are the ajax submission modals, but those i'm less worried about because i can just as easily ignore that post data
[13:40:20] <royalty> i could also put them outside of the form flow anyway
[13:40:22] <royalty> since they are modals
[13:40:47] <robertmaxrees> 'k.
[13:40:53] <robertmaxrees> dunno what you're expecing then :)
[13:42:06] <royalty> can you put a dropzone within a larger form?
[13:42:20] <royalty> because i've only ever seen it in it's own form
[13:42:34] <robertmaxrees> you mean an ajax image upload?
[13:42:37] <royalty> yeah
[13:43:04] <royalty> but in particular i'll probably end up using the dropzone plugin, which i know is not necessarily related to this channel, etc
[13:43:25] <robertmaxrees> you can have a file upload as part of a larger form.
[13:43:28] <royalty> i think that plugin requires a whole form element to itself
[13:44:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm not seeing anything in their docs that says that's a limitations.
[13:44:29] <robertmaxrees> *limitation
[13:45:22] <robertmaxrees> unless i'
[13:45:30] <robertmaxrees> *i'm not understanding what dropzone does.
[13:45:51] <royalty> you're right actually there's even a section on using non-form elements to achieve what you want
[13:45:52] <royalty> https://www.dropzonejs.com/#create-dropzones-programmatically
[13:45:59] <royalty> robertmaxrees, thanks, you are a genius sir
[13:46:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:46:10] <robertmaxrees> not a genius, just asking "why" ;)
[14:11:05] <royalty> big fat form incoming
[14:11:11] <royalty> watch out fellow devs
[18:28:02] <xrandr> Hi all, I am using jquery with php and smarty. I have a DataTables library that runs when the document.ready event fires
[18:28:27] <robertmaxrees> https://media1.tenor.com/images/14c40f547f81d59b116685536079c892/tenor.gif
[18:29:07] <xrandr> The issue i am having is that $.holdReady(true); doesn't seem to be holding the event from firing.
[18:29:36] <xrandr> so when i use jquery to get info to replace sub elements in a tag, and then use the DataTables on that, it does not work
[18:29:40] <robertmaxrees> mind showing youir code?
[18:29:50] <robertmaxrees> *your
[18:30:00] <xrandr> sure
[18:30:12] <xrandr> https://pastebin.com/1VHLWWk8
[18:30:47] <robertmaxrees> hold up
[18:31:25] <xrandr> ok
[18:31:26] <robertmaxrees> it looks like you're including jquery multiple times here.
[18:31:37] <xrandr> Yeah, only on two pages
[18:31:50] <robertmaxrees> can you share the actual html getting sent to the browser?
[18:31:55] <robertmaxrees> instead of the server-side templating code.
[18:31:56] <xrandr> the rest of the project doesn't use the fetch2Dom() function
[18:32:17] <xrandr> robertmaxrees: it won't show the table
[18:32:21] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[18:32:24] <robertmaxrees> i just need the html.
[18:33:00] <xrandr> https://pastebin.com/is6zmUb2
[18:33:33] <robertmaxrees> first off, fix your html.
[18:33:40] <robertmaxrees> you've got an extra opening <CENTER> tag
[18:34:08] <robertmaxrees> second off - why not restructure your code to not require holdready in the first place?
[18:34:16] <robertmaxrees> stuff like that is generally ill advised.
[18:34:59] <xrandr> because I can't figure out how to get the DataTables to work. So it was suggested by a friend to try the .holdReady to see if that would work
[18:35:12] <jphase> IIFE's for the win :)
[18:35:20] <xrandr> I don't know that acronym
[18:35:23] <robertmaxrees> third - I'm seeing jquery getting included twice on this page.  you need to make sure it's only getting included once.  and make sure you're including the right version for datatables/.
[18:35:31] <robertmaxrees> it might require a full version and not the slim version.
[18:35:41] <jphase> (function($){ // jQuery stuff here })(jQuery);
[18:35:50] <robertmaxrees> jphase what does that solve here?
[18:36:00] <jphase> Oh, I read render blocking
[18:36:05] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[18:36:09] <jphase> my bad
[18:37:05] <xrandr> robertmaxrees: it works if i don't use the loading page, and just display the buyorders.tpl file from buyorders.php directly
[18:37:37] <xrandr> but that fetch function takes time to complete, so to the user, it looks like it is hanging
[18:37:40] <robertmaxrees> not sure how those all relate to each other - all i can tell you is what the browser sees :)
[18:37:46] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't care about your server-side.
[18:37:52] <robertmaxrees> it cares only about what's on the page.
[18:38:12] <robertmaxrees> so it sounds like maybe you're including things weird.  kinda like how you have two copies of jquery getting loaded.
[18:38:34] <xrandr> robertmaxrees: I don't know how else to explain why i need to load it twice
[18:38:43] <robertmaxrees> you don't though.
[18:38:48] <robertmaxrees> you only need it once.
[18:38:58] <robertmaxrees> loading it twice will cause bugs and other headaches.
[18:39:24] <xrandr> On that page, I need to load it before the footer.tpl file loads it. Every other page, it just gets loaded from the footer.tpl file
[18:39:51] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change the fact that loading it multiple times will cause bugs.
[18:40:21] <xrandr> maybe i'll just fix that by loading it in the header.tpl file
[18:40:23] <robertmaxrees> looks like you need to resturcture your code.
[18:40:28] <xrandr> and it loads once and only once
[18:40:31] <robertmaxrees> ^
[18:40:33] <robertmaxrees> that works.
[18:40:41] <robertmaxrees> or use webpack.
[18:40:47] <robertmaxrees> or any of 1000 other options :)
[18:41:40] <xrandr> ok, i bow to you then
[18:41:41] <xrandr> that fixed it
[18:41:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:43:42] <xrandr> It boggles my mind that doing that fixedit
[18:43:52] <robertmaxrees> it's because you were juggling what $ was assigned to.
[18:43:58] <xrandr> but, like any other gift horse, I am not looking it in the mouth :)
[18:44:08] <xrandr> oh
[18:44:15] <robertmaxrees> so when you hit the second load, $ no longer meant what it did, so you lost a bunch of stuff.
[18:44:25] <robertmaxrees> why is why you never load jquery more than once.
[18:47:52] <JohnDoe2> https://jsfiddle.net/542rp9ed/ why is serialize() and serializeArray() coming back blank? (open console)
[18:48:36] <robertmaxrees> JohnDoe2 input needs a name
[18:48:57] <JohnDoe2> omg so sorry thank you
[18:51:05] <robertmaxrees> all good :)
[18:53:33] <xrandr> robertmaxrees: thank you so much :)
[18:53:37] <robertmaxrees> def :)
[19:03:08] * xrandr raises an altar to robertmaxrees as a new god :P
[19:04:42] <robertmaxrees> nah, just used to breaking things ;)
