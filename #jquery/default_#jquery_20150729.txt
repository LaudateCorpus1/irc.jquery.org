[00:28:07] <mooncup> Uncaught Error: cannot call methods on button prior to initialization; attempted to call method 'loading'
[00:28:26] <mooncup> google seemed to suggest it might be related to bootstrap, but I'm getting it inside an iframe that basically has nothing in it
[00:28:57] <hellyeah> yes
[00:29:11] <hellyeah> i got
[00:29:35] <hellyeah> cannot call method on dialog prior to initialization; attempted to call method close
[00:29:46] <hellyeah> are you using IE?

[01:41:51] <hellyeah> hey
[01:41:57] <hellyeah> anyone around
[03:34:56] <Whiskey> is it possible to get a variable outside $(document).ready(function () { ?
[03:36:58] <pinc_> If you declare it outised of the doc ready instantiator i.e global namespace then you will have access to it within
[03:38:05] <pinc_> The reverse is not as it is within a different scope
[03:50:48] <hellyeah> hey
[03:50:50] <hellyeah> anyone around

[03:51:42] <Xatenev> anybody familiar with HTML5 in combination with jquery here?
[03:51:52] <Xatenev> just wondering how I would trigger a link which has download="file.ext"
[03:53:22] <chilversc> is there any concept of relative vs absolute selectors for use with libraries such as bootstrap with its data-toggle="..." attributes?
[03:53:55] <chilversc> as most of the time I really just want a selector such as '../button'
[03:55:18] <Uhkis> Xatenev: what do you mean "trigger a link" ?
[03:55:43] <Xatenev> Uhkis: well
[03:55:48] <Xatenev> the same as if i would click the link
[03:55:49] <Xatenev> with my mouse
[03:55:53] <Xatenev> so it downloads the file =)
[03:56:27] <Uhkis> $('a[download="file.ext"]').click(); should work
[03:56:38] <Xatenev> well i have an id selector
[03:56:40] <Xatenev> .click() doesnt work lol
[03:56:47] <Xatenev> $('#download-link').click() doesnt work
[03:57:09] <Uhkis> can you make a fiddle?
[03:57:14] <Xatenev> sure
[03:59:17] <hellyeah> why i cannot use forEach here? http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/53/
[03:59:18] <Xatenev> http://jsfiddle.net/ckdr6j0p/
[03:59:20] <Xatenev> something like that

[03:59:39] <hellyeah> do i need .each
[03:59:49] <Xatenev> im missing a on document read yin my fiddle, but thats how it looks like
[03:59:57] <Xatenev> I have to go to lunch , see u in 30minutes
[04:01:20] <Uhkis> Xatenev: i think you have to use window.location
[04:01:34] <walabe> why isn't this slider working
[04:01:42] <walabe> I want to make the arrows work but they don't http://jsfiddle.net/ye4mefr0/3/
[04:01:43] <Uhkis> it's probably broken
[04:02:12] <hellyeah> need help
[04:02:52] <hellyeah> i chunked the table each just gave me 141,1442,143,144 but i need other records how can i get those? http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/56/
[04:06:31] <walabe> How do I get the arrows NOT to take me to the top of the page https://jsfiddle.net/vqsgkn7e/16/
[04:06:43] <walabe> I'm trying to use the www.unslider.com
[04:14:01] <taplar> your li's have different heights, thats going to jack with your page vertical pos
[04:14:50] <walabe> what do you mean taplar , i don't see height
[04:14:54] <walabe> in css
[04:15:11] <walabe> or should i specify it to fix??
[04:15:20] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/vqsgkn7e/18/ added a console log of each li's height
[04:15:29] <taplar> yeah, make them the same height
[04:15:52] <hellyeah> i have smaller table and try to append to table why didnt show content do i need table.show()
[04:15:55] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/59/
[04:17:44] <taplar> hellyeah: line 7 isn't really valid
[04:17:54] <taplar> a for each doesn't really return a result
[04:17:59] <taplar> it's a logical loop
[04:18:33] <taplar> you wouldn't do var something = for ( var i = 0; ....) {}
[04:18:38] <walabe> still not working taplar
[04:18:50] <walabe> i put height: 1000px; for the li
[04:18:52] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/61/
[04:19:15] <hellyeah> is it corrent now
[04:19:17] <hellyeah> ?
[04:20:17] <taplar> walabe: update your fiddle?
[04:20:38] <taplar> hellyeah: why are you doing a function to get your trs?
[04:20:40] <walabe> https://jsfiddle.net/vqsgkn7e/20/
[04:20:53] <walabe> well it's not working on my own site
[04:21:01] <hellyeah> i added id dynamically
[04:21:03] <walabe> it takes me to the top of the page like a # would
[04:21:13] <hellyeah> it may be useful
[04:21:16] <hellyeah> i dont know
[04:21:21] <hellyeah> may be it is not necessary
[04:22:17] <taplar> walabe: looks like the scroll bar is not jumping now on 20
[04:22:37] <taplar> hellyeah: for what your doing a function for trs isn't necessary
[04:22:49] <hellyeah> yes
[04:22:54] <hellyeah> removed already
[04:23:05] <taplar> and: each(function (item, element)
[04:23:13] <taplar> the first element is the index in that case
[04:23:19] <taplar> you can use it instead of creating your own i
[04:23:57] <taplar> i forget if it starts at 1 or 0, but if it's 1 and you want 0, just -1 when you use it
[04:25:34] <walabe> okay taplar i've got the slider working and it's arrows.... BUT each time I click, it still scrolls me to the top of page
[04:26:02] <walabe> oh I think it's my "scrollto" plugin
[04:26:11] <hellyeah> taplar:  i can fix it late can you check the error http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/67/
[04:26:18] <taplar> fixing to say, dunno what to tell ya, not doing it to me on the fiddle
[04:26:58] <taplar> hellyeah: what is chunks?
[04:27:39] <hellyeah> chunks just a div i created in html part
[04:27:56] <taplar> really?  look at your javascript.  what is chunks?
[04:28:04] <walabe> taplar do you think this code: https://jsfiddle.net/6xpucupn/ could be interfering with my slider arrows???
[04:28:21] <hellyeah> humm
[04:28:34] <hellyeah> oh
[04:28:36] <hellyeah> damn
[04:28:39] <hellyeah> sorry taplar
[04:28:51] <taplar> walabe: if your clicking a link yeah
[04:29:06] <walabe> aghghhg
[04:29:10] <taplar> if you don't want that to happen on your slider links, you'd need to exclude them on your selector
[04:29:48] <taplar> either via a more granular selector or doing $('a').not('whatever').on('click', ...)
[04:30:50] <hellyeah> taplar:  does it seem correct? http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/69/
[04:31:25] <walabe> could you do it for me?
[04:31:25] <taplar> i don't see an error now, :)
[04:31:41] <hellyeah> no error
[04:31:50] <hellyeah> but no result on the "result screen" :D
[04:31:56] <walabe> I don't want the js to run when clicking an empty #
[04:32:18] <hellyeah> do i need .show()
[04:32:22] <hellyeah> or .html
[04:33:47] <taplar> hellyeah: html appended to the body is auto shown unless otherwise made not to
[04:34:17] <taplar> afk a bit
[04:37:44] <hellyeah> taplar:  i did it
[04:43:52] <Herehere> I have a datepicker which works for first two input, but after that. Datepicker shows, but it doesnt type any input after selecting a date
[04:44:05] <Herehere> $( ".datepicker" ).datepicker({ "dateFormat": "yy-mm-dd"});
[04:44:19] <Herehere> every input has class='datepicker'
[04:47:18] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[04:48:16] <Xatenev> Herehere: console?
[04:48:21] <Xatenev> says what?
[04:48:51] <hellyeah> Xatenev:  why i cannot see thead of table can you take a look http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/77/
[04:49:36] <hellyeah> humm
[04:50:27] <taplar> bak
[04:50:36] <Xatenev> hellyeah: append($("WebRequestGridView thead");
[04:50:37] <Xatenev> what?
[04:50:46] <hellyeah> back
[04:51:22] <hellyeah> Xatenev:  checked the console there is nothing inside thead http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/79/
[04:51:31] <taplar> hellyeah: your not appending $table or $thead to the body
[04:51:53] <hellyeah> hmm
[04:52:08] <Xatenev> what are you trying there generally
[04:52:10] <Xatenev> that looks like nonsense
[04:52:13] <taplar> also, if your element is not a jquery object, try to to name them starting with $.  $($tbody) just looks weird
[04:52:15] <Xatenev> or juts for learning purposes?
[04:52:17] <hellyeah> $("body").append($table); ?
[04:52:22] <Xatenev> @hellyeah
[04:52:24] <taplar> *try not to
[04:52:37] <taplar> hellyeah: sure
[04:52:55] <hellyeah> Xatenev:  i have a big table i divided into small tables
[04:53:02] <hellyeah> try to show them in html page
[04:53:05] <hellyeah> i am beginner
[04:53:09] <hellyeah> so i try to learn
[04:53:41] <Xatenev> how would you split a big table into multiple tables?
[04:53:42] <Xatenev> lol
[04:53:54] <Xatenev> that makes no sense imho
[04:53:56] <Herehere> Xatenev: nothing :P
[04:54:02] <Herehere> consoel shows nothing
[04:54:04] <taplar> Xatenev: just roll with it.  he's learning
[04:54:21] <Xatenev> Herehere: can u give me a link?
[04:54:22] <Xatenev> or something? :p
[04:54:26] <hellyeah> Xatenev:  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8495687/split-array-into-chunks
[04:54:35] <hellyeah> i have table 11 rows
[04:54:39] <hellyeah> i have table 144 rows
[04:54:54] <hellyeah> my temparray has 14 small tabels with 10 rows
[04:55:19] <Herehere> Xatenev: I dont think so, because forms is generating from server side :P I just discovered that enter works
[04:56:11] <hellyeah> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/81/
[04:56:51] <taplar> hellyeah: one thing your trying to append a thead to a thead
[04:57:17] <taplar> also document.createElement doesn't create a jquery object
[04:57:25] <taplar> just a regular dom element
[04:57:31] <taplar> you'd have to wrap to use append
[04:59:27] <hellyeah> ah
[04:59:41] <hellyeah> need append tr to thead
[04:59:43] <hellyeah> sorry
[05:04:04] <hellyeah> taplar:  do you mean this http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/84/
[05:04:36] <taplar> lol, sure but hellyeah, you don't have to wrap them twice
[05:04:51] <taplar> that's what i was talking about with the use of $
[05:04:53] <hellyeah> wrap them twice
[05:04:55] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:05:03] <hellyeah> so
[05:05:29] <taplar> if you start a variable name with $, that is typically so that you know later on what is stored in that variable is already a jquery object and you don't have to wrap it with $() again
[05:05:29] <hellyeah> $(document.createElement) make function jquery function?
[05:05:42] <hellyeah> humm
[05:06:10] <taplar> so var $something = $(document.createElement('thead'));
[05:06:11] <taplar> is fine
[05:06:16] <taplar> just don't wrap it again later
[05:06:25] <Birliban> hi, in general, whats better for populating e.g. select fields. loop and .append in each loop or iterate a variable and .append on end of loop?
[05:06:34] <hellyeah> so
[05:06:35] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/86/
[05:06:50] <taplar> Birliban: create all your options in loop to an array, and append the array to the select at the end
[05:06:52] <Uhkis> $('<thead>') makes a lot more sense
[05:07:02] <taplar> ^ that too
[05:07:05] <Uhkis> Birliban: never append in a loop
[05:07:29] <Birliban> Uhkis: taplar: thanks!
[05:07:41] <taplar> hellyeah: better
[05:07:52] <mdev> infinite append loop
[05:08:00] <mdev> must append, must not stop!
[05:08:23] <taplar> mdev: i think you have a typo there.  that's actually an abend, :P
[05:08:24] <hellyeah> taplar:  why no result on result screen? http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/86/
[05:08:53] <mdev> heh
[05:09:10] <taplar> hellyeah: your LN 13 selector is bad
[05:09:44] <hellyeah> thead tr
[05:09:52] <Birliban> taplar: ah, better use an array or an object? eg. like this: http://jsfiddle.net/7Q6wm/
[05:10:17] <taplar> Birliban: elements = [];  elements.push(something)
[05:10:52] <taplar> options are siblings so array is more fitting
[05:11:23] <Birliban> taplar: ok and, the solution in the fiddle with the object? is less efficient?
[05:11:45] <taplar> imho, just unnecessary
[05:12:12] <taplar> why use a sledgehammer when a hammer will work
[05:12:20] <taplar> minus the fun factor
[05:12:51] <taplar> hellyeah: thead and tr are fine
[05:13:16] <Birliban> taplar: ok ;-) can i use then $("something").append(elements); ?
[05:13:23] <hellyeah> still no result on screen http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/89/
[05:13:24] <taplar> Birliban: yep
[05:13:38] <Birliban> Birliban: k. I'll try this thank you.
[05:13:45] <taplar> hellyeah: selector is still bad
[05:13:51] <taplar> hellyeah: examine each piece of it
[05:13:52] <hellyeah> humm,
[05:13:59] <hellyeah> damn
[05:14:05] <hellyeah> i forgot #
[05:14:07] <taplar> :)
[05:14:30] <hellyeah> am i silly or it can happen sometimes :D
[05:15:07] <taplar> typos happen.  had a few yesterday that caused my functional tests to fail on me
[05:15:15] <hellyeah> ic
[05:15:26] <hellyeah> do i need an extra method to show content http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/92/
[05:15:48] <taplar> what do you mean?
[05:16:22] <taplar> and again, why are you still using a function to get your trs?
[05:16:27] <hellyeah> i expect to see thead in result screen
[05:23:51] <Guest57075> taplar:  http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/98/
[05:23:56] <Guest57075> does it seem okey now
[05:26:14] <taplar> question
[05:26:20] <taplar> why do you need the for loop?
[05:26:44] <hellyeah> hmm
[05:26:53] <hellyeah> i have table with 144 rows
[05:26:54] <taplar> logically, your taking the trs from one table, and putting them in another, right?
[05:27:09] <hellyeah> i want to create small tables
[05:27:22] <hellyeah> like 10 10 10 10 .... 4
[05:27:25] <hellyeah> 14 tables there
[05:27:47] <taplar> ok.... in that case, hellyeah, this would really be better done on the back end
[05:27:48] <hellyeah> i want to get 10 rows from a table and putting into another table
[05:27:58] <taplar> don't create tables and break them up on the front end
[05:28:03] <taplar> just create them how you want them
[05:30:23] <hellyeah> taplar:  there are a lot of datas hard to do like that
[05:30:35] <hellyeah> if i would do that i will have many backend code
[05:30:43] <hellyeah> and thats not good
[05:31:18] <taplar> you already have the loop that creates the one big table.  not a large feat to break that up into smaller subsets like your wanting
[05:31:28] <taplar> and didn't we talk yesterday about using ajax for this?
[05:35:18] <newbie|3> taplar:  i practiced AJAX
[05:35:41] <hellyeah> i will use AJAX when i write that
[05:39:22] <Pantolon> DAMN IT
[06:04:14] <JSPractice> hi. I read through the documentation but I can't understand the map function. Can anyone help please?
[06:04:39] <shoky_> yes
[06:04:52] <taplar> it iterates over every element, from each transforms them how you specify, and returns the collection of your transformed objects
[06:06:49] <JSPractice> taplar: okay so if i want to retrieve contents of <h2> tags and store those as an array in JSON format, should I use map or is there an easier way?
[06:07:32] <taplar> the entire thing in json format, or each element in json format?
[06:08:33] <JSPractice> taplar: well actually it's a bit more complicated. I want to store the <h2> in the key, and the <li> under the <h2> as the values
[06:08:46] <JSPractice> and that whole thing should be in json format
[06:09:04] <JSPractice> if I'm not explaining it well, i could give you an example
[06:09:16] <taplar> JSPractice: can you create a fiddle with layout and desired results?
[06:10:09] <JSPractice> taplar: the layout i need the contents from is already a website. i can create a fiddle of the desired results though. i'll get on that, give me a minute
[06:10:41] <taplar> k, for the layout i was just meaning like a small dummy example with the h5s and lis
[06:10:53] <taplar> so i could see the structure
[06:11:52] <JSPractice> the problem is the structure isn't well made. i'll link you to the original site
[06:12:58] <Pantolon> taplar:  wrote with AJAX http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/113/
[06:13:53] <JSPractice> taplar: http://jsfiddle.net/bLxLtfj5/  here is the structure i want it in
[06:14:42] <JSPractice> http://www.jubl.com/investors/investor-feedback-form  and here is the original site. if you scroll down a bit, you'll see the <h2> tags in blue. I want the contents below the h2 tags
[06:16:00] <taplar> k so map isn't a straight solution for you
[06:16:11] <taplar> first you'll have to find your h5s
[06:16:18] <taplar> err, h2
[06:17:05] <taplar> the related data is in a table immediately after it so from an h2 you can get the associated table with the next() off of the h2
[06:17:51] <taplar> then you'll have to do logic to get the text from the first cell, and the value from the second
[06:20:08] <Pantolon> why it pretend weirdly? http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/117/
[06:20:11] <JSPractice> i did that. i found that $("td>strong") returns exactly only the list of elements i need
[06:20:59] <JSPractice> so basically i want to make an array, which has the key of <h2>, and the value of $("td>strong"). but i don't know how to combine these
[06:22:21] <taplar> Pantolon: the point of doing the ajax is to get only the subset of data you want.  not a larger chuck of data that you break up
[06:24:49] <taplar> JSPractice: so you'd have an array, var X = [];  then as you process through your h2s you'd create your object, var Y = {}; Y[tdStrong.val()] = "";  and later on set the Y[tdStrong.val()] to your value you have in cell 2
[06:25:00] <taplar> or if multiple values [] instead of ""
[06:25:35] <taplar> and at the end of processing each h2 you'd X.push(Y) it into the array
[06:25:42] <taplar> and at the end JSON.stringify(X)
[06:26:13] <Pantolon> taplar:  iic
[06:27:23] <JSPractice> taplar: i'm going to read through a bit of json.stringify(). i'll be right back
[06:30:47] <Pantolon> i am stucked pls help why content is not displayed http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/119/
[06:32:19] <taplar> why would it be displayed?
[06:33:09] <taplar> btw, show() does nothing unless your element has style="display: none" on it
[06:33:19] <taplar> elements by default are visible
[06:33:29] <taplar> it's the inverse of hide()
[06:34:33] <Pantolon> yeah you are right
[06:35:16] <taplar> but back to the question.  why should the data be visible?
[06:35:36] <Pantolon> i got subset of table in temparray
[06:35:46] <Pantolon> i added to trs and chunk at the end of code
[06:35:58] <Pantolon> i suppose .show method will show the content
[06:36:08] <taplar> no, remove that line
[06:36:10] <taplar> does nothing
[06:36:14] <blinky_> Hi all, looking for some information please.  I am trying to find a colour picker that I can collect the rgb values from through mouse movement.  I need to be able to store the rgb value so as to send them to a python script on the fly.  Does anyone know where I can get a colour picker that will allow me to do this?
[06:36:23] <Pantolon> hmm
[06:36:24] <taplar> you said you added the trs to chunk?
[06:36:32] <Pantolon> ye
[06:36:37] <taplar> really?
[06:36:41] <Pantolon> $(".chunks").appendTo($trs);
[06:36:53] <Pantolon> i supposed that did the job
[06:37:00] <taplar> tell me what that does
[06:37:21] <shoky> blinky_: spectrum is alright
[06:37:30] <Pantolon> it append trs to chucks am i wrong?
[06:37:49] <taplar> !api appendTo
[06:37:55] <taplar> ?api appendTo
[06:38:00] <shoky> b-ot is on vacation
[06:38:00] <Pantolon> !mdn appendTo
[06:38:00] <taplar> is the bot still on vaca?
[06:38:22] <taplar> http://api.jquery.com/appendto/
[06:38:30] <Pantolon> well
[06:38:40] <Pantolon> append and appendTo perform same task
[06:38:47] <taplar> no
[06:38:58] <Pantolon> ops
[06:39:01] <taplar> they are opposites
[06:39:13] <Pantolon> taplar:
[06:39:16] <taplar> otherwise, why have two functions, :P
[06:39:17] <Pantolon> i know like that
[06:39:24] <Pantolon> i just typed google sentence: The .append() and .appendTo() methods perform the same task. The major difference is in the syntax-specifically, in the placement of the content and target.
[06:39:37] <shoky> a.appendTo(b)  is same as  b.append(a)
[06:39:42] <shoky> sort of
[06:39:42] <taplar> yep
[06:39:52] <Pantolon> ops
[06:39:54] <Pantolon> yes
[06:39:59] <Pantolon> google said same thing
[06:40:00] <Pantolon> :D
[06:40:05] <taplar> so
[06:40:12] <taplar> why should it be visible? :)
[06:41:33] <Pantolon> hmm when i add something to something that is set to visible in css that must show the content i assume
[06:41:46] <taplar> again, everything shows by default
[06:41:51] <Pantolon> $($trs).appendTo($(".chunks")); is that better?
[06:42:00] <taplar> boom
[06:42:02] <Pantolon> if you do display:none
[06:42:05] <taplar> and don't rewrap your $trs
[06:42:08] <Pantolon> boom?
[06:42:19] <Pantolon> sorry
[06:42:58] <taplar> np, just reiterating
[06:43:36] <taplar> gonna make a food run, brb
[06:45:00] <Pantolon> i did it
[06:45:02] <Pantolon> :D:D:D
[06:51:03] <taplar> sweet
[06:51:15] <Herehere> I have this simple ajax function https://dpaste.de/KQWr It sends data when option is selected. But the dropdown has initial value. So how can I send this initial value?
[06:51:58] <Herehere> you know when user not selecting anything
[06:52:16] <taplar> btw Pantolon, i hope your not offended if I'm seeming a little short with you.  I'm trying to encourage you to dig a little into your issues, question what your doing so you can identify where your problems are or may be.
[06:52:41] <Pantolon> taplar:
[06:52:43] <taplar> Herehere: typically default values would be something you wouldn't send
[06:52:45] <Pantolon> i saw your intent
[06:53:01] <taplar> Herehere: atleast for a dropdown
[06:53:09] <Pantolon> problem is i used wrong appendTo method
[06:53:16] <taplar> Pantolon: cool, just wanted to make sure, :)
[06:53:19] <Pantolon> here is the result http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/123/
[06:53:49] <Herehere> taplar: after refreshing page the selected value is still visible in dropdown - I want to send this
[06:54:14] <Herehere> so its not initial value i think xd
[06:54:27] <taplar> hmm
[06:54:43] <taplar> maybe have an event handler for load
[06:54:59] <taplar> if the value isn't default, send it
[06:57:12] <taplar> or actually that wouldn't be necessary, refresh should rerun the javascript initialization on the page
[06:57:24] <taplar> you could just have some code run to do that
[07:18:31] <Herehere> So I have this function, it sends ajax data when I click an element. But inside this element I want it to send data if something is selected in dropdown
[07:18:32] <Herehere> https://dpaste.de/DJKD
[07:19:16] <Herehere> I want to send data when click + if something is changed in drpodown
[07:19:55] <Herehere> but in my code. jQuery looks first for 'click'  :/
[07:21:13] <Herehere> oh i know
[07:21:23] <Herehere> How to put event in if statement?
[07:21:35] <Herehere> for example
[07:21:57] <Herehere> if (($element).change()) - is it correct?
[07:23:09] <decx> that's not how events works
[07:23:26] <blinky_> shoky: That is great mate, cheers, one question, do you know how to stop it pulling the colour if you click out of the box.  I would like to only have the colour called if the submit button is pressed?
[07:23:45] <Herehere> yup just tried and it doesnt work
[07:29:33] <Herehere> How can I call a function defined in a variable?
[07:30:03] <Herehere> here
[07:30:05] <Herehere> https://dpaste.de/9fLn
[07:30:14] <Herehere> I need to call send_data
[07:32:53] <Herehere> anyonme?
[07:37:55] <NoiseEee> Herehere: it gets called anyways, when .edit_task_option is clicked.
[07:38:39] <Herehere> NoiseEee: but I need call ajax function when .employee_input is changed
[07:38:47] <NoiseEee> Herehere: add it to the selector
[07:39:13] <NoiseEee> and break up the function
[07:39:28] <Herehere> NoiseEee: not working     $(".edit_task_option, .employee_input").on('click' ,'change' ,function(){
[07:39:54] <NoiseEee> then try putting the xhr in its own function and calling it on both events
[07:40:35] <Pantolon> i want to add thead section of the table to $table
[07:40:38] <Herehere> NoiseEee: this is working function as I want. But there is too much code
[07:40:39] <Herehere> https://dpaste.de/jZ6i
[07:40:41] <Pantolon> what is wrong here http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/132/
[07:41:08] <NoiseEee> Herehere: something like https://dpaste.de/3gfq
[07:41:11] <Herehere> thats why i want to call ajax function without copy&paste
[07:41:58] <Herehere> NoiseEee: ah I see, is xhr a naming convention?
[07:42:08] <NoiseEee> Herehere: its the proper term for 'ajax'
[07:42:40] <NoiseEee> and obv. you can expand on that function to take arguments or an object of options that might refine the callback or other things after the xhr request
[07:43:23] <Herehere> NoiseEee: thanks a lot it works
[07:43:33] <NoiseEee> np good luck
[07:44:46] <NoiseEee> Pantolon: http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/133/
[07:45:08] <NoiseEee> Pantolon: $tHead[i] is a reference to the bare DOM object, you want to make it a jquery object to use appendTo that way

[07:45:33] <mad_moses> Hi, I'm trying to get rid of the top bar in a jqueryui Dialog. How can I do this with version 1.11.0? The sample http://api.jqueryui.com/dialog/ here for removing the X is not working ...
[07:45:35] <Pantolon> yes
[07:45:44] <Pantolon> i know but sometimes i forgot
[07:46:29] <Pantolon> NoiseEee:  why is there nothing on the result screen http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/134/
[07:48:24] <NoiseEee> hellyeah: i don't see $table being appended anywhere
[07:48:50] <NoiseEee> and you can get around the verbose "document.createElement('table')"  with just $("<table>");
[07:49:01] <hellyeah> i see
[07:49:13] <hellyeah> i used table.show i assumed it shows the header
[07:49:28] <NoiseEee> well im sure $table would show if it were in the document
[07:49:45] <NoiseEee> right now its just a document fragment / you haven't appended it to the DOM
[07:50:53] <hellyeah> NoiseEee:  http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/135/
[07:51:30] <hellyeah> is that what you meant
[07:53:11] <hellyeah> NoiseEee:
[07:53:12] <NoiseEee> without the sloppiness and syntax errors
[07:53:20] <hellyeah> need some help pls :D
[07:53:25] <NoiseEee> hellyeah: what is this function doing, creating tables or what?
[07:53:33] <NoiseEee> i can't even tell
[07:54:00] <lambdu> Hey guys
[07:54:23] <hellyeah> normally this fuinction
[07:54:40] <hellyeah> chunk table into small table
[07:54:52] <hellyeah> sec
[07:55:49] <NoiseEee> hellyeah: i don't know what that means. right now it looks like a heavily commented out, mid-debugging thing that creates tables.  its fine, but APPEND THE TABLES TO THE DOCUMENT
[07:55:53] <serengeor> Hello, I have jquery widget that get's created but I have no variable pointing to it. Is there a way to retrieve a reference to that object so I can call its functions?
[07:56:27] <hellyeah> NoiseEee:  just a sec
[07:57:35] <lambdu> How can I select only the parents that don't have a certain child element?
[08:00:37] <hellyeah> NoiseEee:  still there
[08:00:50] <hellyeah> http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/137/
[08:00:58] <hellyeah> i just try to add head part of table
[08:02:57] <NoiseEee> hellyeah: and again I ask you, where is the newly created table element being inserted into the DOM?
[08:03:35] <hellyeah> i guess i didnt insert table into dom
[08:04:08] <hellyeah> well
[08:04:17] <hellyeah> according to tutorial
[08:04:27] <hellyeah> appendTo insert thing to DOM
[08:04:35] <hellyeah> i just created above
[08:04:37] <hellyeah> is it wrong?
[08:04:50] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/138/ @ hellyeah
[08:04:51] <NoiseEee> good luck
[08:05:22] <hellyeah> humm
[08:05:23] <hellyeah> ic
[08:05:34] <hellyeah> you append it chunk
[08:05:39] <hellyeah> i created in the html
[08:05:45] <hellyeah> this is what you meant right
[08:06:20] <NoiseEee> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/139/ i didnt append your ROWS to the TABLE
[08:06:54] <NoiseEee> hellyeah: your code is confusing, your goal is confusing, know that you need to actually append things to something else to see them, your table was not going in the dom (for the umpteenth time). i have things to do, have a nice day
[08:07:27] <hellyeah> nice day
[08:35:49] <d3m0n> I have setup an ajax request with a variable sent back called "succuess" when it processes. What would your next step be to show the user a success message.
[08:36:09] <robertmaxrees> use the .done() callback to handle that message.
[08:36:39] <d3m0n> robertmaxrees: Not really what I mean. After you've called done. Then what do you personally do.
[08:36:48] <d3m0n> Add msg via html?
[08:36:52] <robertmaxrees> oh, you mean design related?  depends on the form.
[08:37:04] <d3m0n> $(ele).html(<tag></tag>);
[08:37:19] <d3m0n> or do a javascript if($var){}
[08:37:35] <robertmaxrees> check to make sure it's a success, and then show the appropriate messaging.
[08:38:12] <d3m0n> haha, yea. I'm talking about connecting the two
[08:38:29] <robertmaxrees> have a success field in the page and use .show()
[08:38:47] <robertmaxrees> unless you have specific validation to worry about.
[08:38:49] <d3m0n> Yeah that's an option as well
[08:38:57] <d3m0n> Well thes one thing I thought about too
[08:39:08] <d3m0n> Ive seen people reply errors in the ajax, then rely them in an array
[08:39:14] <d3m0n> To json
[08:39:27] <d3m0n> Which seems kinda nice
[08:39:40] <robertmaxrees> you'd need to use an object to map which input had which error.
[08:39:44] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, you could do that, too.
[08:39:57] <d3m0n> the post and variable already do that matching via php
[08:40:25] <d3m0n> its a matter of replying with specific variables $error->nameInput
[08:40:43] <d3m0n> hmm
[08:41:07] <d3m0n> Success is only 1 msg
[08:41:52] <NoiseEee> {errors:[{inputName:errorMsg},{inputName:errorMsg},{inputName:errorMsg},]
[08:42:03] <NoiseEee> somthing to that effect
[08:42:11] <d3m0n> Exactly
[08:42:22] <jim87> hello! I've got a service which provides pure JSON data. Is it possible to use it in return of a jQuery's $.ajax parameter? The provider is on a different domain (localhost -> remote)
[08:42:45] <NoiseEee> d3m0n: so you could class the 'inputName' or associated label or what-have-you with '.error' etc
[08:43:26] <d3m0n> NoiseEee: when youre dealing with showing success/error msgs. How do you handle them?
[08:43:39] <NoiseEee> if its a form i'd do like above
[08:44:10] <d3m0n> So .error would contain your msg?
[08:44:26] <d3m0n> Or just input the array data
[08:44:31] <NoiseEee> for just feedback i tend to use https://github.com/jboesch/Gritter
[08:44:56] <NoiseEee> .error would add a red border around something for example
[08:45:06] <NoiseEee> and then i could append or insert the errorMsg value of the return into it
[08:45:08] <NoiseEee> etc tec
[08:45:18] <d3m0n> Gotcha
[08:45:23] <d3m0n> That's how I've seen it done before
[08:45:45] <d3m0n> A little bit more advanced then adding the msg with jquery's $(ele).html
[08:46:00] <NoiseEee> alas UI/UX is more than just programmin'
[08:46:15] <d3m0n> Yes indeed
[09:10:20] <blinky_> Hi all, I am using the Spectrum color picker - https://bgrins.github.io/spectrum/ - and it works well.  I have noticed that when you select a colour you can either click the submit button or click outside of the picker to store that colour. Does anyone know how to restrict it to only using the button and not when clicking outside the picker?
[09:13:10] <mvpgraff> Is there a specific way to style cells for an xls export? I tried to use xlsContent += '<table><tbody><tr><td bgcolor="#000000">' + jsonData + '</td></tr></tbody></table>' and I'm also using 'data:application/vnd.ms-excel;base64,' + $.base64.encode(xlsContent); but the XLS outputs the HTML in the cells rather than styling it.
[09:13:26] <shoky> blinky_: there's a "clickoutFiresChange" option which defaults to true
[09:13:46] <blinky_> shoky: looking now cheers
[09:15:17] <blinky_> shoky: Brilliant mate, thank you very much
[09:24:02] <Birliban> Hi, as with jquery 1.11, do I rather use click() or on("click", handler )?
[09:24:33] <shoky> Birliban: either one. the first is a shortcut for the 2nd
[09:25:05] <Birliban> shoky: so no cons or pros for either one?
[09:25:32] <shoky> Birliban: nope

[10:30:29] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[10:30:51] <mvpgraff> I created an export to XLS
[10:31:07] <mvpgraff> but numbers doesn't read html, but excel obv does
[10:31:32] <robertmaxrees> what does HTML have to do with XLS?
[10:31:33] <mvpgraff> So I kept thinking my code is broken in terms of styling the cells, but it's just apple numbers being bad
[10:44:30] <abishek> is there a way to retrieve the woff2 url from a google font request using javascript. This is the request `http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Abril+Fatface`, the response of which is the css font face rules.
[10:45:11] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask?
[10:46:53] <robertmaxrees> abishek because that's a weird question.
[10:48:23] <abishek> am working with svg to process svg conversion to png, I need to embed the font. so I am looking for this solution
[10:49:03] <robertmaxrees> i'd do this server-side and parse it out.
[10:49:51] <robertmaxrees> i mean, you could use $.ajax() and try to use a regex to grab it.

[11:21:10] <iCHAIT> I am using this jquery color picker to show color palettes in django admin and consequently choose a color from it.
[11:21:10] <iCHAIT> https://djangosnippets.org/snippets/1261/
[11:21:24] <iCHAIT> But in the admin side the color palettes is not visible, it just gives me an empty box.
[11:21:52] <iCHAIT> In the console when I remove type="hidden" from the corresponding field it works fine.
[11:21:57] <iCHAIT> What could be the problem?
[11:22:16] <robertmaxrees> is that field supposed to be hidden?
[11:22:20] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a CSS problem.
[11:22:25] <iCHAIT> No
[11:22:41] <iCHAIT> It is essentially a color palette
[11:22:43] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:22:46] <robertmaxrees> that is hidden.
[11:23:05] <silverdust> What I think is your color palette reference an image in CSS which it cannot find
[11:23:44] <iCHAIT> Fow a quick look -
[11:23:45] <iCHAIT> http://dpaste.com/2Y1SRNG
[11:23:54] <iCHAIT> Here is my widgets.py
[11:24:16] <silverdust> You should make sure they are properly linked. The last time I had to use a color palette in rails, i had installed it through bower and only called its JS through sprockets then the CSS as a mixin so I'll reference the file properly
[11:25:12] <iCHAIT> As I said when I remove type="hidden" from the field in console, it works fine, so I guess it should not be an issue where it is not linked properly.
[11:25:18] <silverdust> JESUS!! What?
[11:25:33] <robertmaxrees> iCHAIT right - there may be a style hiding based on siblings.
[11:26:12] <iCHAIT> robertmaxrees: Can you explain a bit more?
[11:26:28] <silverdust> Is that how they call front-end plugins in Django?
[11:27:26] <iCHAIT> silverdust: Yes, I think so.
[11:28:11] <robertmaxrees> iCHAIT css lets you do things like [type=hidden] + div { display: none; } (or whatever)
[11:29:07] <iCHAIT> robertmaxrees: Are you suggesting that I should remove the type-hidden styling from the css file of that plugin?
[11:29:16] <iCHAIT> It can be one solution.
[11:29:20] <robertmaxrees> i'm suggesting that there's CSS on your end doing that.
[11:29:23] <iCHAIT> I think.
[11:29:57] <iCHAIT> robertmaxrees: I have not defined any css for those fields as of now.
[11:30:06] <robertmaxrees> drupal may have.
[11:30:16] <robertmaxrees> or django or whatever
[11:30:19] <silverdust> Is this drupal?
[11:30:31] <robertmaxrees> whatever platform you're using.
[11:30:39] <iCHAIT> I am using django
[11:30:44] <iCHAIT> Yeah, maybe.
[11:30:49] <robertmaxrees> platform agnostic concept though.
[11:30:52] <robertmaxrees> without seeing it, it's really hard to help.
[11:30:55] <silverdust> Here's the thing iCHAIT . I think you're either not following best practices or Django is really messy
[11:31:31] <silverdust> Why can't you just call the assets in the HTML. How will a frontend developer cope with this?
[11:32:40] <iCHAIT> I am using the color palette on the django admin and not on any specific template, the django admin view is pre defined.
[11:33:36] <silverdust> IMO this one is just so easy to set up and works perfectly http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/
[11:33:57] <robertmaxrees> silverdust using the system the platform gives you for including plugins is usually the preferred way of adding plugins.
[11:35:16] <silverdust> I concur. I don't know Django
[11:35:53] <robertmaxrees> i was commenting about your thing about "why can't you just call the assets in the HTML."
[11:38:24] <silverdust> I agree to that. Like with rails we call it all in the application.js and sprockets compile the whole thing before serving
[11:38:49] <silverdust> The method just looked too complex and wrong
[11:39:28] <Whiskey> I have an timer that updates every second, and i have a hover that comes whit a tooltip when you have mouse over it. But every second the time change the tooltip disappear. Anyway to always have it on top?
[11:40:13] <robertmaxrees> Whiskey no way for us to know without seeing it happen.
[11:41:08] <Whiskey> Very hard to make an example
[11:41:29] <robertmaxrees> shouldn't be, but okay.
[11:41:30] <markholmes> even harder for us to imagine
[11:41:37] <Whiskey> But its just a tooltip and every second the timer ticks the tooltip will disappear
[11:41:44] <robertmaxrees> cool.
[11:41:46] <Whiskey> Do jQuery has anything the look it
[11:41:47] <robertmaxrees> no way for us to know.
[11:41:52] <robertmaxrees> sorry!
[11:42:35] <Whiskey> What part do you not´t understand?
[11:42:42] <Whiskey> I have told you exactly whats happen
[11:43:01] <robertmaxrees> right - but there could be dozens of reasons that's happening.
[11:43:08] <robertmaxrees> without us seeing it in action, we can't really help.
[11:43:10] <Whiskey> True
[11:43:39] <robertmaxrees> the only guess i could even toss out might be that you're replacing the entire tooltip, when you need to update just the contents of the tooltip.
[11:44:44] <Whiskey> Sad for me that you don´t know how hard it is to make an example, see if i have some old in fiddle
[11:44:51] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[11:44:57] <robertmaxrees> it's really easy to make a fiddle for this.
[11:45:07] <Whiskey> aa that should work
[11:45:09] <silverdust> Whiskey: There's what they call reduced test case
[11:45:16] <robertmaxrees> ^
[11:45:26] <robertmaxrees> i don't want your whole page.
[11:45:43] <robertmaxrees> i want just your tooltip, the updater thing, and a barebones piece of markup.
[11:46:02] <Whiskey> Damit
[11:46:12] <Whiskey> it don´t happen in the example
[11:52:24] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/q5D8E/3/ <-- thats an working example
[11:52:38] <Whiskey> the tooltip is not any jQuery i just thinked that can slove my problem
[11:52:50] <robertmaxrees> so where's the tooltip?
[11:52:57] <Whiskey> ooo over the hashes
[11:53:28] <robertmaxrees> you mean the browser tooltip?
[11:53:40] <Whiskey> yeh
[11:53:47] <robertmaxrees> those don't disappear for me.
[11:53:56] <robertmaxrees> and you can't really muck with browser-supplied tooltips anyway.
[11:54:27] <Whiskey> it does for me
[11:54:38] <robertmaxrees> what browser?
[11:54:46] <Whiskey> What is the most basic way to do it whit jQuery? You don´t need any plugin for it i hope?
[11:54:47] <Whiskey> FF
[11:54:49] <robertmaxrees> and does it happen in that fiddle?
[11:54:52] <Whiskey> But im allredy think thats the problem
[11:54:56] <Whiskey> yeh
[11:55:04] <robertmaxrees> doesn't happen for me in FF.
[11:55:09] <robertmaxrees> and you'd want a plugin to handle it.
[11:55:22] <Whiskey> No plugin
[11:55:31] <robertmaxrees> then get writing.
[11:55:40] <Whiskey> i like it won´t happen
[11:56:19] <robertmaxrees> if you have jquery ui in this, it has tooltips.
[11:56:37] <Whiskey> but damit do i need to run a whole bounh of code to get tooltip
[11:56:54] <robertmaxrees> why does that matter?
[11:57:27] <Whiskey> i don´t see the point
[11:58:04] <robertmaxrees> you can't modify browser tooltips, so you'll need to supply your own.  either write your own or use a plugin from somebody else that's already solved everything for you.
[11:59:05] <Whiskey> yeh see if i come up whit it, jQuery UI is no option
[11:59:08] <Whiskey> thanks anyway
[12:38:15] <neruda> anyone ever see an autocomplete widget produce an extra div outside of the container? I'm seeing this in 1.11 and not able to understand why
[12:38:30] <neruda> extra div contains selected result btw
[12:39:09] <robertmaxrees> which autocomplete widget?
[12:39:36] <neruda> jquery
[12:39:39] <neruda> jquery-ui
[12:40:05] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to see it.  not sure off the bat.
[13:21:57] <blinky_> Hi all, is there a way of refreshing a div, some text, without it flickering?
[13:22:04] <robertmaxrees> "refreshing"?
[13:23:19] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: this is what I am using at the moment - http://pastie.org/10318972
[13:23:42] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: But it flickers when it is refreshed
[13:24:03] <robertmaxrees> you need to use a deferred and flip your logic.
[13:24:26] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: Could you explain that one please
[13:24:38] <robertmaxrees> you need to let the ajax finish before you do the fadeIn.
[13:25:56] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: oops, didnt mean to leave the fadeIn in there.  I was trying something else, I usually leave it with just $("#temp").load('includes/temp.php');  How do I wait for the ajax to finish, place a pause in?
[13:26:04] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:26:05] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:26:19] <robertmaxrees> actually, .load() should be doing that already.
[13:26:27] <Es0teric> quick question -- i want to create a collection of div id's that i want to iterate through and add .selectize() to
[13:26:33] <Es0teric> how do i do that?
[13:26:36] <robertmaxrees> blinky_ https://bpaste.net/show/3a57e43a8666
[13:26:37] <Es0teric> short of doing a .each
[13:26:51] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric huh?  are you trying to run selectize against multiple IDs?
[13:27:02] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yes
[13:27:04] <robertmaxrees> because you could do $('#id1, #id2, #id3').selectize()
[13:27:10] <robertmaxrees> unless it doesn't support that.
[13:27:21] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees oh
[13:27:22] <Es0teric> ok
[13:27:44] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees but the context if i type would be selecting all the divs right?
[13:27:49] <Es0teric> or would it automatically assume $(this)
[13:27:52] <Es0teric> ?
[13:27:55] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric huh?
[13:27:59] <Es0teric> nvm
[13:29:17] <mvpgraff> robertmaxrees: I'm exporting some JSON into XLS and I'm using data:application/vnd.ms-excel;base64,' + $.base64.encode(jsonContent) for the export, but I receive this as my error when opening my XLS (It still works if I hit yes, just trying to figure out why this error happens) http://i.imgur.com/kTr7cCt.png
[13:30:00] <robertmaxrees> that error usually means the extension doesn't match the contents.
[13:30:08] <robertmaxrees> sounds like it's xlsx?
[13:30:10] <robertmaxrees> no clue.
[13:30:29] <mvpgraff> well xlsx doesn't work at all D:
[13:30:33] <robertmaxrees> no clue then.
[13:30:36] <robertmaxrees> not a jquery problem.
[13:30:39] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: Is this what you are suggesting? http://pastie.org/10318978 ?
[13:31:39] <robertmaxrees> don't use an interval, butbasically, yeah.
[13:34:21] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: ok I am confused sorry, If I remove the interval then there is no refresh.
[13:34:33] <robertmaxrees> right - you should use a recursive timeout.
[13:34:35] <robertmaxrees> nbot an interval.
[13:35:37] <robertmaxrees> like this: https://bpaste.net/show/e8924aac914b
[13:35:45] <robertmaxrees> your code assumes the ajax will complete by a certain time.
[13:37:17] <kingfisher64> hello, wondering if anyone knows of a jquery script which randomises background images at a specific screen res. http://www.jqueryscript.net/other/jQuery-Plugin-For-Random-Background-Image-randomBackground.html is the closest I've found but this is not resolution specific. Many thanks
[13:37:27] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:37:32] <robertmaxrees> what does resolution have to do with it?
[13:39:17] <kingfisher64> it's for a site robertmaxrees which is running supersized plugin down to < 768px so I only want these random background images to appear below that :)
[13:39:57] <robertmaxrees> then detect if ($(window).width() < 768) { /* init plugin here */ }
[13:41:04] <kingfisher64> no on that link posted all i'd have to do is wrap that syntax around section 4) ?
[13:41:22] <kingfisher64> so on that link... ^^^
[13:41:23] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[13:41:43] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: I am sorry to be a pain, I am completely confused.the script you provided calls itself and waits for a second yeah?  If that is correct then I can not get it to display the data.  Dont know what I am doing wrong.
[13:41:56] <robertmaxrees> blinky_ open your console.
[13:42:18] <robertmaxrees> oh, actually - https://bpaste.net/show/8dc654c9fa1d
[13:42:20] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want.
[13:44:06] <blinky_> robertmaxrees: Right that works, but it still flickers.  Guess I am just going to have to live with it, shame.
[13:44:20] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand what you mean by "flickers"
[13:44:29] <robertmaxrees> unless your page is really complex or something.
[13:44:32] <kingfisher64> is http://pastebin.com/DdTKbKdL correct robertmaxrees. Thank you for your advice
[13:44:44] <robertmaxrees> kingfisher64 it'll look something like that.
[13:45:23] <kingfisher64> is there double semi-colons at the end? Something looks wrong robertmaxrees
[13:45:39] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:45:57] <robertmaxrees> the last semicolon is unecessary, but that's valid code.
[13:46:01] <robertmaxrees> what about it "looks wrong"?
[13:46:36] <kingfisher64> it's that last semi not needed. Thanks robertmaxrees
[14:07:23] <nardev> guys how can i select elements which are placed in div that has "display: none" set?
[14:07:33] <robertmaxrees> like you would any other.
[14:10:40] <nardev> robbyoconnor, well
[14:11:11] <robertmaxrees> wrong username ;)
[14:11:12] <nardev> robertmaxrees, i try this on element which is not in visible div: $("#positions").select2({maximumSelectionLength: 3 });
[14:11:21] <nardev> robertmaxrees,
[14:11:40] <nardev> and css is not fully being applied..
[14:11:44] <nardev> how to solve that?
[14:11:59] <robertmaxrees> if the parent div is display: none; the child elements won't show either.
[14:12:37] <nardev> robertmaxrees, cool, so.. how do i apply css on elements that are within nondisplayed tab?
[14:12:46] <robertmaxrees> like you do any other
[14:13:01] <nardev> robertmaxrees, it ried this $("#positions").select2({maximumSelectionLength: 3 });
[14:13:09] <robertmaxrees> the display: none; only impacts that parent element.  everything else functions as it would normally.
[14:13:13] <nardev> and it works but css is not completely applied
[14:13:24] <robertmaxrees> how are you confirming that?
[14:13:30] <robertmaxrees> if you can't see it, how do you know?
[14:13:54] <nardev> robbyoconnor, i set this on page load: $("#positions").select2({maximumSelectionLength: 3 });
[14:14:14] <nardev> and i have some other select2() objects which are in first tab
[14:14:25] <nardev> they get proper js/css
[14:14:46] <nardev> and the object in tab which is not displayed right away doesn't appear 100% ok...
[14:14:56] <robertmaxrees> how many #positions elements are there?
[14:15:01] <nardev> 2
[14:15:04] <robertmaxrees> that's why.
[14:15:09] <nardev> when i put all them in first tab it works ok
[14:15:09] <robertmaxrees> you can only have an id once per page.
[14:15:16] <nardev> no no
[14:15:17] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:15:21] <nardev> robertmaxrees, i have different ids
[14:15:23] <nardev> sorry
[14:15:33] <robertmaxrees> does the second tab get ajaxed in or anything like that?
[14:15:38] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle showing the problem?
[14:15:39] <nardev> just both have .select2({maximumSelectionLength: 3 });
[14:15:52] <nardev> robertmaxrees, i'll send the fiddle
[14:16:03] <nardev> no it is not ajaxed exactly because i wanted to avoid this
[14:18:00] <nardev> robertmaxrees, i is so obvious, when i switch to hidden tab and when i apply this through console i get it correctly $("#positions").select2({maximumSelectionLength: 3 });
[14:18:22] <robertmaxrees> without a fiddle i really can't help you.
[14:18:33] <nardev> so so so so hard to make one
[14:18:34] <nardev> :(
[14:18:39] <nardev> os complicated code :(
[14:18:45] <robertmaxrees> i don't want the whole page.
[14:18:53] <robertmaxrees> just 2 tabs with select2.
[14:26:38] <nardev> robertmaxrees, i have exactly the same
[14:26:39] <nardev> case
[14:26:41] <nardev> here
[14:26:50] <nardev> https://jsfiddle.net/j9yguxno/
[14:26:52] <nardev> robertmaxrees,
[14:27:48] <nardev> i use multiple select
[14:28:38] <robertmaxrees> easy
[14:28:45] <nardev> robertmaxrees, updated here https://jsfiddle.net/j9yguxno/2/
[14:28:47] <nardev> ok..
[14:28:53] <nardev> how to fix the width
[14:28:57] <robertmaxrees> the width calculation is wrong on load.
[14:29:01] <nardev> of element in second tab
[14:29:02] <nardev> ???
[14:29:03] <robertmaxrees> so manually apply it.
[14:29:12] <nardev> robertmaxrees, how to make responsive
[14:29:13] <nardev> :(
[14:29:18] <nardev> all other controls are responsive
[14:29:19] <nardev> :(
[14:29:21] <robertmaxrees> init on click.
[14:29:25] <robertmaxrees> instead of on load.
[14:29:37] <nardev> which click? switching tabs?
[14:29:41] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:29:42] <gambl0re> whats up playboy...
[14:29:45] <robertmaxrees> when a tab changes, init that tab.
[14:29:52] <nardev> robertmaxrees, ok
[14:30:00] <nardev> help me how to make that
[14:30:02] <nardev> please
[14:30:08] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[14:30:24] <robertmaxrees> try doing it first.
[14:30:30] <robertmaxrees> i'll answer questions you have along the way.
[14:30:44] <nardev> robertmaxrees, i have 5-6 different controls in 7 tabs
[14:30:45] <gambl0re> robertmatrix do you have experience using meteor?
[14:30:48] <nardev> i have same issue
[14:30:55] <nardev> for all those controls
[14:31:00] <nardev> not only select2
[14:31:00] <robertmaxrees> nardev so we'll use this as an example.
[14:31:09] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re they're not around right now i don't think..
[14:31:15] <nardev> is there some generic
[14:31:16] <nardev> way
[14:31:23] <nardev> to fix this
[14:31:25] <gambl0re> whos not around...
[14:31:30] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re robertmatrix
[14:31:33] <nardev> so that i don't need to have 10000 lines of js
[14:31:35] <nardev> always
[14:31:36] <robertmaxrees> you pinged them and they're not here.
[14:31:40] <nardev> reinitiating controls
[14:31:40] <nardev> ?
[14:31:47] <robertmaxrees> nardev basically, yes - also, please stop spamming the channel :)
[14:31:54] <nardev> is there a way to reload js
[14:31:55] <arc_> lol omg..
[14:32:12] <nardev> could you tell me what is that "general" solution possibly?
[14:32:27] <robertmaxrees> nardev dude slow down.  you don't need to reload anything.  you just need to run $(".js-example-basic-multiple").select2(); within a tabchange or click event listener for that particular tab.
[14:32:43] <arc_> gambl0re do you honestly not get that you have gotten his name wrong every single time you say it for weeks or possibly months
[14:33:06] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re oh, you meant me?  we talked about this a few weeks ago - you get my username wrong every day.
[14:33:21] <nardev> robertmaxrees, just imagine i have 5 different plugins and issues and i have 7 tabs.. reloading all them on any possible situation.. 5*7 and possibility of a mistake...
[14:33:31] <robertmaxrees> nardev what would you like me to do, then?
[14:33:35] <robertmaxrees> i'm not going to write it for you.
[14:33:51] <robertmaxrees> try handling the case in the fiddle, then we can work on abstracting it a bit more.
[14:35:03] <nardev> robertmaxrees, i'm looking for more generic way to reload the js on tab switching.. not control by control...
[14:35:13] <robertmaxrees> nardev that's a bad idea.
[14:35:20] <robertmaxrees> you need to init things on an as-needed basis.
[14:35:29] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're going to have things break all over the place.
[14:35:41] <nardev> well when i change tab it is "as-needed" case
[14:35:59] <robertmaxrees> no, you're reloading and reapplying js that might cause things to double fire, etc.
[14:36:22] <robertmaxrees> do this the right way. you won't have a bunch of redundant code if you do it right.
[14:36:31] <robertmaxrees> if you need help understanding that, fine, but at least try first.
[14:37:01] <gambl0re> what?..
[14:37:20] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re what do you think my username is?
[14:37:30] <robertmaxrees> like, how does it display on your screen?
[14:37:32] <nardev> robertmaxrees, what if i put all tabs in active mode before loading and after everything is loaded just hide them and leave first one open?
[14:37:40] <robertmaxrees> nardev that's a bad idea.
[14:37:48] <robertmaxrees> just do it on open of each tab.
[14:37:57] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you're arguing with me about this lol.
[14:38:20] <nardev> it was plain and simple question
[14:38:28] <nardev> and you gave an answer
[14:38:35] <nardev> i see no arguing there at all
[14:38:36] <nardev> !
[14:38:36] <robertmaxrees> right - i've given you a solution but you seem really uninterested inhearing that.,
[14:38:40] <gambl0re> https://github.com/rickywid/meteor-problem-cant-fix
[14:38:42] <gambl0re> woops
[14:39:20] <gambl0re> that wasnt meant for you guys..dont click it
[14:39:33] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re you going to answer my question?
[14:39:37] <gambl0re> what?
[14:39:54] <robertmaxrees> what username do you see for me?
[14:40:36] <gambl0re> im busy right now...
[14:44:02] <nardev> robertmaxrees, i was looking for something even better.. why do you have problems accepting that your knowledge and your solutions are supreme ?
[14:44:10] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:44:14] <nardev> *not supreme
[14:44:30] <robertmaxrees> nardev there's nothing better here - it's the solution to your problem.  otherwise you'll end up with all sorts of strange load issues.
[14:46:08] <nardev> robertmaxrees, i just found in commercial SmartAdmin bootstrap template that for an ajax version guy has a loadScript function which reloads everything and you don't need to wary about that.. just put which files you want to load every time you need it..
[14:46:10] <nardev> why not..
[14:47:02] <robertmaxrees> 2 problems: 1) you're fundamentally redefining your issue at that point. 2) why reload all your js when you just need to to apply to a particular tab?
[14:48:48] <nardev> 2. i already replied.. too many combinations, too many controls to take care about.. 1. maybe.. now i load tab content via ajax ...you are right, not very honest way.. agan.. thank you anyway for looking into my issue...
[14:48:55] <robertmaxrees> uh...
[14:49:10] <robertmaxrees> i'm obviously not explaining myself very well.
[14:49:16] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to write code for each tab.
[14:49:17] <nardev> i strongly suggest humbleness
[14:49:35] <nardev> robertmaxrees, hm..
[14:49:40] <nardev> how
[14:49:40] <nardev> ?
[14:50:13] <nardev> i need to initialize datepicker, custom toggle button, select2 element etc in firt one..
[14:50:18] <nardev> *first one
[14:50:46] <nardev> than in second tab, i have all those elements with different ids for different forms
[14:50:46] <nardev> than again reinitialize those
[14:50:46] <nardev> etc..
[14:50:51] <nardev> where is the stop?
[14:51:03] <nardev> maybe i missed the point..
[14:51:04] <robertmaxrees> on tab change, find everything of a particular class in the current tab and initialize them.
[14:51:19] <nardev> robertmaxrees, exactly what i have just said..
[14:51:27] <nardev> find everything and initialize
[14:51:37] <nardev> although it bit more work
[14:51:46] <nardev> than just "find and init"
[14:51:46] <robertmaxrees> not on pageload.
[14:51:47] <robertmaxrees> on tab change.
[14:51:53] <nardev> hmm..
[14:51:56] <nardev> please
[14:51:57] <nardev> help me
[14:51:58] <robertmaxrees> and just for that tab.
[14:52:00] <arc_> -_-;;
[14:52:05] <nardev> write that listener
[14:52:18] <nardev> PLEASE :/?
[14:52:47] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[14:53:27] <nardev> nice
[14:53:35] <nardev> and what would that be to select
[14:53:38] <nardev> bootstrap tabs
[14:53:42] <nardev> all of those?
[14:53:45] <robertmaxrees> i don't have your html in front of me.
[14:53:46] <nardev> and to make that
[14:53:46] <nardev> ?
[14:53:54] <nardev> write pseudo
[14:53:59] <robertmaxrees> a jsfiddle.
[14:54:12] <nardev> use this https://jsfiddle.net/j9yguxno/2/
[14:54:15] <robertmaxrees> even better - http://learn.jquery.com/events/
[14:54:16] <robertmaxrees> start here.
[14:54:41] <nardev> robertmaxrees, this is exactly i ha have https://jsfiddle.net/j9yguxno/2/
[14:54:55] <robertmaxrees> awesome - check out the learning center tutorials about events and event binding.
[14:55:00] <robertmaxrees> that's exactly what you'll need here :)
[14:55:40] <nardev> robertmaxrees, well.. great...
[14:55:50] <nardev> that works every time i believe
[14:56:59] <robertmaxrees> http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs-events will help, too.
[14:59:06] <nardev> i made it
[14:59:12] <nardev> can i kiss you now?
[14:59:28] <nardev> robertmaxrees,
[15:00:14] <robertmaxrees> congrats
[15:17:31] <draconusdesigns> I am using jQuery for a site, along with tinyMCE and featherlight.js. My tinyMCE init function applies a wysiwyg editor to all textareas with the class of "wysiwyg". This works great with the exception of if the text area is in a featherlight form. I don't know where to go about this issue, as there is little support for either that has been of much help through Googling an answer. I could...
[15:17:32] <draconusdesigns> ...realy use a jquery buff to assist me with this. Thanks.
[15:17:37] <draconusdesigns> really*
[15:18:18] <robertmaxrees> so you can't init tinymce textareas within a featherlight form?
[15:18:33] <draconusdesigns> Yes.
[15:18:55] <robertmaxrees> that usually means the library is cloning things incorrectly.  trying initializing after you open the modal.
[15:18:56] <draconusdesigns> They show up as tinymce, but they do not work.
[15:19:02] <draconusdesigns> alright.
[15:19:55] <draconusdesigns> http://codeshare.io/l2jrO
[15:20:20] <draconusdesigns> This is what I have currently, but the issue is not resolved. Does this help you to see where i am running into a wall?
[15:20:53] <robertmaxrees> right - that's why you init the tinymce in the modal when you open the modal.
[15:21:10] <draconusdesigns> Yeah, line 8
[15:21:20] <robertmaxrees> then i have no idea.  i'd need a fiddle.
[15:21:38] <draconusdesigns> It is a tough thing to set up a tinymce fiddle, but i shall attempt it.
[15:21:43] <draconusdesigns> (lots of scripts)
[15:22:20] <robertmaxrees> fwiw tinymce.init({}) needs to be in the afterOpen callback.
[15:26:49] <robertmaxrees> draconusdesigns see what i mean?
[15:28:28] <draconusdesigns> http://fiddle.tinymce.com/AUeaab
[15:28:42] <draconusdesigns> hm.
[15:28:47] <robertmaxrees> you need to put the entire init in the callback.
[15:29:36] <draconusdesigns> you are correct.
[15:29:56] <draconusdesigns> That worked.
[15:30:20] <robertmaxrees> not ideal, but that's probably because the modal lib is cloning things i strange ways.
[15:32:41] <draconusdesigns> *sigh*
[15:32:47] <draconusdesigns> Yeah, that will just have to do.
[15:32:58] <draconusdesigns> Thanks.
[15:34:41] <draconusdesigns> It is just weird that the tinymce.EditorManager.execCommand('mceAddEditor', didnt work
[15:52:26] <HelpMeThanks> Anyone know when to use jquery .each vs _.each?
[15:52:52] <robertmaxrees> why use either?
[15:54:11] <robertmaxrees> to more directly address your question - use $.each() when you have jquery included and _.each() when you have underscore included.
[15:54:29] <robertmaxrees> but you shouldn't really need to use either since javascript has .forEach() natively.
[15:59:05] <nardev> is it possible to change $(document).ready()  to  user .on() method?
[15:59:10] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:59:51] <HelpMeThanks> foreach became native when?
[15:59:53] <HelpMeThanks> 1.5?
[15:59:54] <HelpMeThanks> js
[16:00:08] <robertmaxrees> ES5.
[16:00:22] <robertmaxrees> 1.5 is mozilla-specific.  don't rely on that for actual versioning.
[16:03:08] <HelpMeThanks> robert thanks for the help
[16:03:15] <HelpMeThanks> :)
[16:04:01] <robertmaxrees> of course!
[16:04:06] <robertmaxrees> oh they alreayd left haha
[16:09:46] <arc_> idk if anybody here has heard of "PageCloud" but people are lauding it and it seems to me like it's promising something that it won't deliver
[16:10:50] <arc_> supposed to be like actual wysiwyg page design within the browser, where you can do stuff like just drag and drop whole modules onto your page and resize them like an object in a powerpoint presentation
[16:17:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i heard about that arc_
[16:18:58] <arc_> what do you think about it
[16:19:33] <robertmaxrees> it's been a long time since that page was created.
[16:19:42] <robertmaxrees> something tells me their goals are a little too lofty.
[16:19:47] <arc_> heh
[16:20:15] <arc_> i guess they were at techcrunch disrupt in may
[16:20:50] <arc_> but yeah idk. it seems like they're just asking for trouble with the whole concept
[16:21:59] <arc_> charge completely nontechnical people a monthly fee for this, and they'll put together stuff that makes no sense, can't be responsive, and breaks everything, and pagecloud support will have to fix it
[16:22:34] <arc_> there's a reason that you restrict people's options
[16:24:27] <drei> Previously selected glyphicon not pointing the right way when dropdown is collapsed, see fiddle - https://jsfiddle.net/u1jrje44/. Any help much appreciated!
[16:29:07] <drei> any ideas <robertmaxrees>?
[16:31:50] <arc_> drale2k_ sorry, what?
[16:32:07] <arc_> it looks like it's working as one would expect
[16:32:28] <arc_> it's facing down normally, and facing up when you expand
[16:32:33] <arc_> drei* not drale2k_
[16:33:20] <drale2k_> works fine for me
[16:33:36] <arc_> oh nevermind i see what the problem is
[16:34:07] <drei> <arc_> the current active one is fine, it's the previous one that was clicked that is still pointing up rather then down
[16:34:16] <arc_> yeah i figured that out
[16:34:23] <drei> nearly there
[16:37:33] <arc_> i don't think you can do not(clicked)
[16:37:40] <arc_> it's expecting a selector not a variable
[16:38:57] <booblabla> So what are you guys’ opinions as to how fluent one should be in javascript before using jquery?
[16:39:11] <robertmaxrees> oh.  no women allowed on this question!
[16:39:15] <robertmaxrees> :(
[16:39:23] <arc_> ha ha
[16:39:36] <robertmaxrees> but seriously, you should know javascript.
[16:39:57] <drei> lol
[16:41:02] <booblabla> haha sorry
[16:41:32] <booblabla> yeah, but how much is “know”. like, should I basically be able to implement everything that jquery implements ?
[16:42:45] <shoky> go learn instead of asking useless questions. jquery is a javascript library. you're coding in javascript, not in jquery. you should learn the language you code in, the more the better
[16:43:22] <shoky> the more you know the language, the better, i mean
[16:43:29] <drei> need a way of selecting all the non clicked one first
[16:44:29] <robertmaxrees> why not swap the class on all and then swap again on the one you care about?
[16:45:14] <arc_> if you open one, and then open another one without closing the first one first, i don't think that will work
[16:45:21] <robertmaxrees> yeah it will.
[16:45:23] <robertmaxrees> overthinking it.
[16:45:24] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[16:46:07] <drei> <robertmaxrees> can you update fiddle to illustrate?
[16:47:05] <robertmaxrees> sure, one sec.
[16:47:46] <drei> the expand and collapse on the dropdowns works fine...it's just the glyphicons that need fixing
[16:48:28] <robertmaxrees> this is why i hate toggles.
[16:49:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u1jrje44/2/ - this is the start - you'd need to add in state.
[16:55:55] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u1jrje44/3/ like this drale2k_
[16:55:58] <robertmaxrees> err, drei
[16:56:18] <robertmaxrees> oh they left already hah
[17:00:36] <arc_> : /
[17:01:47] <drei> sorry <robertmaxrees> got disconnected. What you mean by adding state?
[17:01:56] <robertmaxrees> drei i made a fiddle for you :)
[17:01:59] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u1jrje44/3/
[17:03:22] <drei> still not working though
[17:03:26] <robertmaxrees> it is for me.
[17:03:47] <drei> only works by clicking twice
[17:03:53] <robertmaxrees> ah - need to .each() through the spans.
[17:04:16] <robertmaxrees> get the basic idea though?
[17:04:26] <drei> it does at first but then have to click twice
[17:04:30] <robertmaxrees> right.
[17:04:37] <robertmaxrees> so you'd need to .each() through the spans.
[17:04:56] <drei> which is what I originally hadf
[17:05:04] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i had originally.
[17:05:13] <robertmaxrees> i saw icons "out of sync" with their dropdowns.
[17:06:39] <drei> yes, you're rigght
[17:08:28] <drei> how would I add .each() through the spans?
[17:08:32] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[17:10:52] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u1jrje44/4/ there we go.
[17:11:06] <robertmaxrees> you could add in another layer to close the current one if you wanted.
[17:11:09] <robertmaxrees> but the basic idea is there.
[17:12:27] <kokut> Hello, there is something strange and unsettling going on in firefox, when slideToggle is called a second time (to hide the element again) it keeps using the space, the rest of the elements below it dont readjust unless i open firebug...console is clean.. whats going on?
[17:14:09] <robertmaxrees> sounds like things aren't getting recalculated unless the window resizes.
[17:14:40] <kokut> i used to like firefox, now i hate it, why cant we all agree to use chrome?
[17:14:45] <robertmaxrees> i prefer FF.
[17:14:47] <robertmaxrees> i hate chrome.
[17:14:48] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[17:14:52] <kokut> are u nuts
[17:14:58] <robertmaxrees> it's consistent for me.
[17:15:07] <kokut> chrome is 10x faster
[17:15:11] <robertmaxrees> not for me.
[17:15:18] <robertmaxrees> e10s changed that, at least.
[17:16:01] <kokut> idc man just use whatever makes you happy i cant use it because its slow and i have to spend freaking hours fixing my websites for it which is stupid
[17:16:17] <robertmaxrees> i never really spend time on cross-browser issues.
[17:16:22] <robertmaxrees> since i never really have them.
[17:16:48] <drei> thank you so much <robertmaxrees> you are a real pro!
[17:16:53] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[17:17:34] <drei> to close the current one can I just stick something at the end of that or midify the existing code?
[17:17:55] <robertmaxrees> you'd basically need code to check the current status and not run that last little bit if so.
[17:18:01] <robertmaxrees> *if it's open.
[17:18:37] <kokut> robertmaxrees: so are you telling me i need to add a windows resized notification for baby ff or something :\ this is beyond inconvenient
[17:18:54] <robertmaxrees> i doubt the problem is actually with FF.
[17:19:02] <robertmaxrees> without seeing your code i have no idea what the issue could be.
[17:19:04] <kokut> well, in chrome it works 100% fine
[17:19:17] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make chrome right ;)
[17:22:16] <kokut> so are you telling me i need to change all my markup and css just for ff?
[17:22:30] <kokut> when it works completely fine in chrome?
[17:22:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm saying that iu have no idea what might be causing your problem.
[17:22:53] <robertmaxrees> i'm also saying that chrome isn't always spec-compliant, and has plenty of bugs in it that can cause inconsistencies.
[17:23:10] <kokut> all my jquery is element.click toggle nothing more so the problem must be on the CSS or HTML
[17:24:03] <kokut> besides i dont even understand front end developers who use FF when 70% of the market share is chrome and chrome has better tools
[17:24:25] <robertmaxrees> i think FF has better tools.
[17:24:27] <kokut> also, firefox is only used in africa
[17:24:31] <robertmaxrees> and my code rarely has any problems.
[17:24:43] <robertmaxrees> i have fewer cross-browser issues than our chrome developers do.
[17:25:04] <robertmaxrees> you also don't know my userbase ;)
[17:25:57] <kokut> it doesnt matter you know that FF market share is below 20% worldwide, in front end developers its probably very below 50%
[17:25:57] <drei> <robertmaxrees> what would I need to add so that when clicking on each one it closes too?
[17:26:21] <robertmaxrees> kokut why does it matter?  i prefer it, and my end users have a consistent, useful experience?
[17:26:48] <robertmaxrees> you're the one with cross-browser issues, but somehow trying to tell me that my tooling choice is bad.  why not just accept it for what it is?  it works for me.
[17:26:49] <robertmaxrees> big whoop.
[17:28:04] <kokut> by using firefox you contribute to fragmentation but idc just use the one you prefer but as sooner as you switch it will be less painful and you will have to switch anyways because firefox use is declining fast and i'm glad because chrome is better
[17:28:28] <arc_> in my experience all browsers are extremely fast when you first install them and slow down over time, then you switch to another browser and it's fast again but slows down over time
[17:28:53] <arc_> that includes chrome
[17:29:02] <arc_> which is my preferred browser
[17:29:13] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:29:18] <kokut> nope, i cant even use firefox, 3 tabs and im all out of resources, not to mention if there is a slider or some javascript it freezes my computer like its 1995
[17:29:36] <robertmaxrees> kokut i've never had those problems.
[17:29:37] <arc_> sounds like there is some other problem
[17:29:42] <robertmaxrees> and you're presenting a fallacy there.
[17:29:58] <kokut> well sorry if i cant buy a computer with 32gb of ram, 4 cpu and SSD
[17:30:17] <robertmaxrees> perf has improved greatly over the last few months.
[17:30:22] <robertmaxrees> FF works just as well as chrome for me.
[17:30:31] <robertmaxrees> and my system isn't some godlike contraption.
[17:31:10] <arc_> i honestly can't tell the difference between any modern browser as far as performance at this point
[17:31:25] <arc_> i'm mostly waiting on the server, not on the browser
[17:31:26] <kokut> well, im sorry but mozilla doesnt have the resources to compete against google, google team is better, faster, more focused and bigger
[17:31:50] <robertmaxrees> team != browser.
[17:31:50] <arc_> not really sure why you are so adamant about this atm
[17:31:52] <robertmaxrees> i prefer ff.
[17:31:55] <robertmaxrees> you prefer chrome.
[17:31:57] <robertmaxrees> who cares?
[17:32:13] <kokut> you know i used to prefer firefox too, i used to defend it too for years
[17:32:28] <kokut> until i couldnt work beause it froze my computer all the time
[17:32:31] <robertmaxrees> 1) i switched to chrome for a while and switched back.
[17:32:48] <robertmaxrees> 2) chrome had big bugs that nobody wanted to fix for years (like popstate)
[17:33:24] <robertmaxrees> 3) jquery core had more fixes in it for webkit than ie and ff combined.  this may still be the case post blink/webkit split.
[17:33:24] <arc_> pretty sure something else is to blame if firefox is 'freezing your computer all the time'
[17:33:41] <kokut> arc_: maybe because i'm on ubuntu
[17:34:06] <kokut> arc_: either case chrome runs 10x faster (probably hundreds of times but idk)
[17:34:23] <arc_> seems unlikely
[17:34:23] <robertmaxrees> please stop making claims you cannot corroborate.  thx.
[17:35:18] <kokut> well idc, anyways just use what makes you happy the only thing that bothers me is that i have to fix my websites for firefox all the time when most people use chrome
[17:35:56] <arc_> well just be glad you aren't a web developer 20 years ago
[17:35:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:36:04] <arc_> it's easy now
[17:36:14] <robertmaxrees> i use FF and don't have nearly that many issues.
[17:36:18] <robertmaxrees> so who knows?
[17:36:19] <kokut> i've only been a developer for 12 years
[17:36:34] <arc_> well you should know it's much easier now than it was when you started then
[17:36:38] <kokut> i switched to chrome only 6 months ago
[17:37:03] <kokut> the other 11.5 years where mostly firefox and opera
[17:37:18] <kokut> were*
[17:42:29] <kokut> robertmaxrees: still havent found how to fix this, do i need to add some CSS rule somewhere for slideToggle to work?
[17:42:42] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea what is causing your issue so i don't know what to tell you.
[17:43:31] <kokut> .slideToggle() is not bringing up the elements after they were displaced down by it
[17:43:46] <robertmaxrees> awesome.  i don't have your code in front of me so i can't really help you.
[17:43:49] <robertmaxrees> do you have a fiddle or something?
[17:45:00] <kokut> k nvm found it, for firefox i need to add e.preventDefault();     e.stopPropagation();
[17:45:12] <robertmaxrees> so the issue was the event was bubbling?
[17:45:20] <robertmaxrees> because event bubbling happens in every browser.
[17:45:27] <higuys> What's the diff between .on('click') & .click()
[17:45:35] <robertmaxrees> higuys the former proxies to the latter.
[17:45:38] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, identical.
[17:46:09] <higuys> What do you mean proxies..
[17:46:22] <robertmaxrees> higuys .click() uses .on('click') under the hood.
[17:46:26] <robertmaxrees> it's just a shortcut.
[17:46:57] <drei> how would go about closing the one that is currently open - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u1jrje44/4/
[17:47:00] <higuys> So its better to use .click() then..
[17:47:05] <robertmaxrees> higuys i prefer .on()
[17:47:16] <robertmaxrees> drei what have you tried?
[17:47:33] <higuys> OK thanks robert.
[17:49:37] <drei> still trying a few things...although can't get it to work
[17:52:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u1jrje44/10/
[17:54:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u1jrje44/11/ updated to make it clearer.
[17:54:24] <kokut> the animation looks like crap in firefox ffs :(
[17:54:32] <robertmaxrees> are you using css transforms?
[17:54:37] <robertmaxrees> or jquery's animate?
[17:54:37] <kokut> its not even animated :(
[17:54:52] <kokut> i'm using slideToggle()
[17:55:02] <robertmaxrees> slideToggle() works in JQ.
[17:55:06] <kokut> slideToggle("900")
[17:55:09] <robertmaxrees> err, FF
[17:55:15] <robertmaxrees> i've seen it work plenty of times.
[17:56:20] <kokut> can i IM u the website and u try to find whats blocking the animation or something? its working fine in chrome
[17:56:26] <robertmaxrees> uh.
[17:56:33] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle and paste it here.
[17:56:48] <kokut> its too much code to make a fiddle out of it
[17:57:00] <robertmaxrees> i don't want the whole page - just a test case.
[17:57:02] <kokut> besides i probably cant even reproduce the error in a fiddle
[17:57:18] <robertmaxrees> if you really don't think you can, share the page here in the channel.
[17:57:24] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/c3rtfrfk/ works.
[17:57:44] <drei> sorry robmaxrees got disconnected if there were any updates
[17:57:55] <robertmaxrees> also: no quotes around the number, kokut
[17:57:56] <drei> *robertmaxrees
[17:58:05] <robertmaxrees> drale2k_ https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u1jrje44/11/ updated to make it clearer.
[17:58:08] <robertmaxrees> err, drei
[17:58:42] <kokut> well that didnt fix it
[17:59:00] <robertmaxrees> kokut feel free to share the link in the channel.
[17:59:04] <robertmaxrees> please don't PM it to me though.
[17:59:34] <kokut> the element is animating correctly whats not working is the rest of the dom being adjusted in a graceful manner like it does in chrome, its like 2 positions up and down
[17:59:44] <drei> you mean use that as a guide and apply it to the one you had done?
[17:59:57] <robertmaxrees> drei i mean that one works as expected.
[18:00:19] <robertmaxrees> i had a version before with some bad variable names getting tossed around.
[18:02:20] <robertmaxrees> welp i have to go home.
[18:02:22] <robertmaxrees> enjoy.
[18:02:53] <drei> that one has the double click problem
[18:15:23] <drei> anyone know how to solve double click issue when hiding and showing dropdown - https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/u1jrje44/11/
[18:25:22] <walabe> hello
[18:25:40] <walabe> Why would a plugin / script I'm using make my whole website / computer SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO slow
[18:26:00] <arc_> need way more information
[18:26:42] <walabe> I'm trying to use this http://jquery.vostrel.cz/reel
[18:27:46] <walabe> WHY is it so slow, this is so blood annoying, my whole website is shit bvecause its so slow
[18:28:00] <walabe> that plugin makes it really slow
[18:28:08] <Lencl> For .clone(). If it's cloning an <input>, is there a way to ignore the current data in there? so that it's empty
[18:28:42] <arc_> idk. it doesn't seem very responsive even on this site
[18:29:11] <walabe> yes it is
[18:29:18] <arc_> Lencl can you just set the value to '' after cloning it
[18:29:28] <dopie> .click is a method?
[18:29:33] <dopie> or function?
[18:29:43] <arc_> walabe it takes about half a second after i click and drag to start animating
[18:29:49] <arc_> but i'm sure it's worse on your site
[18:30:17] <walabe> Well that's no issue, issue is my whole site being bloody unusable because I can't scroll i can't do anything becaus eit's so LAGGYG
[18:30:33] <arc_> i understand that
[18:30:41] <docmur> if I have 20 buttons all with the name prefix, aka userButton, then followed by a -# such as userButton-1, userButton-2 and etc.. how would I figure out which one was clicked from a $("#userButton") style call
[18:30:46] <walabe> I didn't know this would be so difficult or impossible
[18:30:52] <walabe> should i just give up on having a product rotatable?????
[18:31:13] <arc_> i would recommend using a different plugin
[18:31:26] <walabe> do you have an recommendations?
[18:31:36] <walabe> because they are all pretty shitty

[22:24:23] <Phagus> I'm new to jQuery. Are there such things as jQuery widget packages or something that already has elements, styles, and behaviors defined, and I'd just have to plug into my page?
[22:25:15] <phiz> Phagus: something like bootstrap?
[22:25:31] <Phagus> phiz: What does Bootstrap do exactly?
[22:27:05] <Phagus> Oh I guess it is Bootstrap
[22:27:19] <Phagus> Can I customize the colors for Bootstrap?

[22:39:04] <lukenzo> good morning
[22:39:58] <lukenzo> i need help with passing variables
[22:41:48] * jaggzt comforta lukenzo for his loss
[22:44:08] <gurke_> good morning. :)
[22:58:45] <lukenzo> hi. could you help me with passing variables?
[22:59:28] <Uhkis> nope, because you don't provide enough info
[23:00:15] <mdev> people on freenode want all your codes lukenzo
[23:00:18] <mdev> don't give it to them
[23:00:27] <mdev> they trying to steal your knowledge
[23:00:36] <Uhkis> :D
[23:00:40] <mdev> #nevaforget
[23:00:52] <lukenzo> hahaha
[23:00:57] <mdev> :p
[23:02:33] <lukenzo> The problem is that I dont have code. I have a variable $cat and I want to send it to $(document).ready(function(){}); function, but how?
[23:04:48] <mdev> $(document).ready(function(){}); is called when page finishes loading, so you can use whatever variables you want in it afterwards
[23:05:16] <lukenzo> well, but for example alert(cat); is not working
[23:05:17] <mdev>  $(document).ready(function(){ alert($cat); ...
[23:05:30] <lukenzo> oh.. I missed $
[23:06:04] <lukenzo> still not working
[23:06:13] <mdev> did you define it before trying to call it?
[23:06:19] <mdev> var cat = 'whatever'; alert(cat);
[23:06:49] <lukenzo> my variable $cat is not in jquery
[23:07:12] <mdev> it doesn't have to be, just defined globally or somewhere where jquery/javascript can access it
[23:07:20] <mdev> you sure your jquery.js is loading right?
[23:07:29] <mdev> you get any errors in console for your browser
[23:07:49] <lukenzo> if i write alert("asd"); it is working
[23:08:00] <lukenzo> how to define it globally then?
[23:08:03] <mdev> try console.log(cat); then
[23:08:09] <lukenzo> ok
[23:08:31] <mdev> globally just define it outside all functions, like <script> var cat = 'test';  $(document).ready(function(){ etc...
[23:10:55] <lukenzo> isnt it enough that it is defined in <?php ... ?>
[23:10:57] <lukenzo> ?
[23:11:26] <mdev> <?php stuff is executed server side, javascript executed in your browser so client side
[23:11:32] <mdev> you can spit out javascript with php like
[23:12:13] <arup_r> I am using http://fullcalendar.io/docs/event_data/events_json_feed/ as event calender.. After doing Ajax call, in what format I need to send data from backend so that the calender can be drawn
[23:12:20] <mdev> <?php echo '<script>var cat = "whatever";</script>'?>;
[23:13:08] <mdev> or simply <?php echo 'var cat = "whatever";' ?>;
[23:13:20] <mdev> inside of your javascript code inside of a <script>
[23:13:41] <Uhkis> arup_r: http://fullcalendar.io/docs/event_data/Event_Source_Object/
[23:13:50] <mdev> so what that will do is, server will execute the php, php will spit out that line, then browser will load like usual
[23:14:37] <arup_r> Uhkis: I found link http://jsbin.com/rogiqa/1/edit?html,css,js,output I think it will work.. right ?
[23:15:48] <Uhkis> arup_r: as it says in the docs, "It must be a traditional JavaScript object with properties" so yes, that should work fine
[23:16:04] <arup_r> ok thanks Uhkis let me try
[23:17:51] <lukenzo> Maybe I can get it in any other way?
[23:20:24] <arup_r> Uhkis: why the ajaxBUEvents func is outside of document.ready() ? If I put it inside it will work too.. right ?
[23:23:54] <Whiskey> Can someone check http://jsfiddle.net/Slaktarn/q5D8E/5/ <-- if you have the mouse over the hashes text, it will come a tooltip. Sometimes it disappers and i thnk it has something to do whit the ticking timers. But it not happen always so you have to have it over and take it off and you will notice when it happens
[23:25:43] <Whiskey> You will see on the marker than something happens like the javascript updates something i don´t know actully
[23:33:43] <BenL90> hello, anyone, I have a div that I want to remove anyway, I tried remove() on click, not working. No error on console, need help
[23:35:24] <BenL90> anyone?
[23:35:28] <Uhkis> BenL90: code?
[23:35:34] <BenL90> Oh, wait
[23:36:55] <Whiskey> Hate javascript it makes so many problems :/
[23:37:52] <BenL90> Uhkis: http://jsfiddle.net/tL15bnzf/
[23:38:07] <BenL90> when I make alert, the alert can't gone anyway
[23:39:08] <BenL90> I don't use alert because seems many people not realize when on chrome based browser
[23:40:21] <BenL90> Uhkis: Problem is can't remove div
[23:44:34] <Uhkis> BenL90: http://jsfiddle.net/tL15bnzf/1/
[23:44:47] <hellyeah> hey
[23:46:05] <Uhkis> BenL90: actually that's really bad, sec
[23:46:34] <Whiskey> Think it is the // JavaScript TextWidth function thats makes the problem
[23:47:34] <Uhkis> BenL90: http://jsfiddle.net/tL15bnzf/2/
[23:48:13] <hellyeah> hey
[23:48:16] <hellyeah> sup
[23:49:35] <Whiskey> seems like its the html_calc.prependTo("body");
[23:53:07] <BenL90> Uhkis: What's causing that error? Why I should use body?
[23:53:33] <BenL90> Uhkis: What means with 'click', '#alert'
[23:54:32] <Pantolon> hey it looks not like a table how can i fix that? http://jsfiddle.net/w58fnnos/140/
[23:56:24] <Uhkis> BenL90: http://api.jquery.com/on/ read the delegated part
[23:57:02] <BenL90> Uhkis: Why only only #alert and #ok
[23:57:10] <BenL90> Uhkis: Is that not possible?
[23:57:36] <Uhkis> ?
[23:59:17] <BenL90> Uhkis: I mean my old code, is that an error or something that not possible to do? Removing the #alert with cliking on #ok
[23:59:24] <BenL90> DIV #ok
