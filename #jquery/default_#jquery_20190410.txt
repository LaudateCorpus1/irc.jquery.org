[00:12:22] <robertmaxrees> alturic you don't want jquery for this.
[01:22:35] <al_nz1> when a backend database returns some data from a query to the browser, what are the options for storing that data? ie, html fields in the webpage is a obvious one, but what are the other options and what if some of the data needs to be kept hidden from the user?
[01:23:04] <robertmaxrees> define "hidden"
[01:23:09] <robertmaxrees> just like, not displayed?
[01:23:14] <robertmaxrees> or does it need to be protected in some way?
[01:24:34] <al_nz1> Hi robertmaxrees. I dont think it needs to be protected. Its just a database UID
[01:24:46] <robertmaxrees> what will you be using it for?
[01:27:48] <al_nz1> I have a main page which has a "Add Person" button. Click this button displays a modal where you enter information to query a person (by name or drivers license etc). When the query information is submitted another modal displayes the results. Select a result (using a radio) and then Click the "Use this person" button to add that person back to the main window. The way I have this workflow
[01:27:48] <al_nz1> setup at the moment the person deails that come back to the browser are displayed in a results table with the fields combined, so firstname + middlename + surname <br/> + address + </br> dob etc
[01:28:17] <robertmaxrees> i meant more like, is it part of a form or something?
[01:29:15] <al_nz1> so the question is how to store the results when it comes back to the results window, should the data be combined at that point? and how to get it back to main window
[01:29:31] <robertmaxrees> ^ see previous question
[01:29:53] <robertmaxrees> like, why would you need to store the UID when the data comes back?
[01:31:40] <robertmaxrees> i ask because if it's going to be part of a form submit of some kind (ajax or otherwise), I'd just store it as a hidden field.
[01:31:56] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you'll need to store it on the window object to make it globally accessible.
[01:32:21] <al_nz1> so when the data comes back from the query results window and you send to the main window, that main window is ultimately subitted back to the database, only the person UID needs to go back to the data base, but name and address etc are displayed to the user in that main page
[01:32:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah, then just as a hidden field.
[01:33:40] <al_nz1> So I have googled this question a bit, what is this "local storage" I hear about, and why wouldnt you create a javascript person object to store the results in as an arrray?
[01:34:01] <robertmaxrees> 1: you only have 1 person, so there's no need for an array.
[01:34:15] <robertmaxrees> 2: localstorage is great for persistent storage, but you don't need it in this case, because...
[01:34:30] <robertmaxrees> 3: a hidden form field that's apart of the form you already have is exactly what hidden form fields are for.
[01:34:34] <al_nz1> robert: if you query by drivers license, then the result set will be 1, but if you query by name you will get 10 results at a time
[01:34:50] <robertmaxrees> formgroups are a thing :)
[01:34:59] <robertmaxrees> just telling you how I'd do it.
[01:35:03] <al_nz1> form groups?
[01:35:20] <robertmaxrees> err, fieldset
[01:35:30] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/fieldset
[01:37:55] <al_nz1> here is what I have so far : https://gist.github.com/bigalnz/5827acc3cb60510667e9451dfc176df8
[01:38:08] <robertmaxrees> that's a lot of code lol
[01:38:14] <robertmaxrees> not really gonna read through it.
[01:38:18] <robertmaxrees> sorry :(
[01:38:29] <al_nz1> line 20 inserts the person into a table
[01:38:34] <al_nz1> on the results
[01:38:47] <robertmaxrees> so
[01:38:53] <robertmaxrees> why not just use inputs?
[01:38:53] <robertmaxrees> :)
[01:38:54] <al_nz1> how would you store the UID? A extra <td> which is hidden?
[01:39:08] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use ps there.
[01:39:16] <al_nz1> ps?
[01:39:19] <robertmaxrees> <p>
[01:39:21] <robertmaxrees> p tagsd
[01:39:22] <robertmaxrees> *tags
[01:39:26] <robertmaxrees> since those are for paragraphs.
[01:39:34] <al_nz1> I was trying to get a line break
[01:39:34] <robertmaxrees> and right now your markup isn't semantic.
[01:39:46] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:39:56] <robertmaxrees> then why are you using a table?
[01:40:19] <al_nz1> I want a line break between name<line break>address<linebreak>
[01:40:27] <robertmaxrees> then you don't want a table.
[01:40:29] <al_nz1> </br> didnt seem to do it
[01:40:33] <robertmaxrees> that's not tabular data.
[01:40:38] <robertmaxrees> yeah, because you're using a <table>
[01:40:40] <robertmaxrees> :)
[01:40:53] <al_nz1> cant I have line breaks in a cell?
[01:41:00] <robertmaxrees> doesn't make sense with a table.
[01:41:11] <robertmaxrees> tables are for when you have a header row and then the columns fall under that header row.
[01:41:31] <robertmaxrees> in this case, you're not presenting as tabular data, so it doesn't make sense to use a table.
[01:42:21] <al_nz1> right, so how would you present it? This is what it looks like now BTW https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55589465/how-to-store-display-and-pass-information-between-main-window-and-modal
[01:42:40] <robertmaxrees> ...
[01:42:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:42:52] <robertmaxrees> let me rephrase.
[01:43:04] <robertmaxrees> your current presentation makes sense - your markup does not.
[01:43:24] <robertmaxrees> your html implies a different presentation, but you're fighting against it.
[01:43:42] <robertmaxrees> using tables for layout is super, super oldschool.
[01:44:43] <robertmaxrees> if you really have a good reason for using the wrong markup for this, then use a data attribute on the parent <tr> to hold the UID
[01:45:02] <robertmaxrees> heck, you could use a data attribute regardless.
[01:45:59] <al_nz1> Im n00b, so how should I be laying out this data?
[01:46:06] <robertmaxrees> again
[01:46:12] <robertmaxrees> your layout is fine.
[01:46:24] <robertmaxrees> the html you're using to get there doesn't make sense.
[01:46:36] <robertmaxrees> don't use <table> unless you have tabular data.
[01:46:38] <al_nz1> so what html should I be using in this scenario?
[01:46:44] <robertmaxrees> not a table :)
[01:46:49] <robertmaxrees> divs and spans.
[01:46:54] <robertmaxrees> w/ css.
[01:47:19] <robertmaxrees> but to answer your original question - you should use a hidden input or use a data attribute on a parent wrapping element to hold the uid
[01:47:26] <al_nz1> sigh ok, dont really kow where to start - do you know of a example or guide thats close to what I am doing?
[01:47:34] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:47:42] <robertmaxrees> there's not going to be a guide for something this specific.
[01:47:51] <robertmaxrees> just slap a data attribute on the <tr> and call it a day.
[01:48:19] <al_nz1> im not in a hurry - happy to do it the right way - its all good learning at the end of the day
[01:48:42] <robertmaxrees> i just don't have time to hand hold through it.
[01:48:44] <robertmaxrees> that's all.
[01:48:59] <robertmaxrees> almost 11pm :)
[01:49:13] <al_nz1> no, and I didnt expect or ask you to - just got to find something vaguely similar I can copy
[01:49:23] <robertmaxrees> that's a problem though.
[01:49:32] <robertmaxrees> asking for stuff you can copy is really counterproductive.
[01:49:47] <al_nz1> a guide was what I asked for
[01:50:03] <robertmaxrees> what you want to do is relatively specific and, as such, there aren't really any guides for it.
[01:50:29] <al_nz1> funny, i type into google layout data in html, the second bloody link is html tables!!!
[01:50:29] <robertmaxrees> at least, I highly doubt there are.
[01:50:36] <robertmaxrees> again
[01:50:45] <al_nz1> PS: I am also using bootstrap FWIW
[01:50:49] <robertmaxrees> tables are for - and i know this is shocking - tabular data.
[01:50:57] <robertmaxrees> you don't have tabular data.
[01:51:04] <robertmaxrees> as such, you don't want to use tables.
[01:52:19] <al_nz1> what about using the bootstrap grid to layout the data?
[01:52:29] <robertmaxrees> fantastic idea.
[01:53:18] <robertmaxrees> you could have a parent wrapping div for each "person" (radio button and person data) and then attach a data attribute to that container with the uid.
[01:53:22] <robertmaxrees> bing bang boom.
[01:53:57] <al_nz1> suppose a sample is out of the question?
[01:54:13] <robertmaxrees> a sample?
[01:54:14] <robertmaxrees> of what?
[01:54:57] <al_nz1> the html that wraps a person
[01:55:09] <robertmaxrees> what part of what i said doesn't make sense?
[01:55:32] <robertmaxrees> <div data-uid="12315423434134"></div>
[01:55:35] <robertmaxrees> ???
[01:56:03] <al_nz1> how would you seperate the radio and the name of each person?
[01:56:21] <robertmaxrees> bootstrap grid - that's 2 columns.
[01:56:42] <al_nz1> right. Well I am playing with a fiddle now to see how far i get
[01:57:13] <robertmaxrees> you'd have div class="row"
[01:57:47] <robertmaxrees> and then div class=col-lg-3 for the radio and then col-lg-9 for the rest.
[01:57:51] <robertmaxrees> or whatever sizes you want.
[01:58:02] <robertmaxrees> are you familiar with what col-lg-3 etc does?
[01:59:11] <al_nz1> hold on a sec
[01:59:17] <robertmaxrees> :|
[02:00:01] <al_nz1> bugger, cant even get basic stuff right
[02:00:02] <al_nz1> https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/6m9bpah2/5/
[02:00:09] <al_nz1> why is the name on a seperate line?
[02:00:13] <al_nz1> from the radio
[02:00:31] <robertmaxrees> i mean
[02:00:35] <robertmaxrees> "col-1"?
[02:00:39] <al_nz1> they are bothin in the same row class
[02:00:52] <robertmaxrees> col-1 doens't mean anything though?
[02:01:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/a2u3kd16/
[02:01:11] <robertmaxrees> need a screen size in there.
[02:01:21] <robertmaxrees> col-sm-1, col-lg-10, etc.
[02:01:37] <al_nz1> col-1 is used in the docs!! https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/
[02:01:58] <robertmaxrees> https://netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.0.0/css/bootstrap.min.css
[02:02:04] <robertmaxrees> you're using bootstrap 3 in that fiddle.
[02:02:33] <al_nz1> ok fair enuf
[02:02:38] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[02:03:25] <al_nz1> is the data div in the right place? https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/6m9bpah2/7/
[02:03:41] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[02:04:07] <al_nz1> well its in the same row....is that where you would place it within the html?
[02:05:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/38y47zwg/2/
[02:05:57] <robertmaxrees> use the grid, my dude
[02:12:47] <al_nz1> I thought I did use the grid? I had a row, then a col for the radio, and a col for the persons data?
[02:13:00] <robertmaxrees> you just needed to go a tad further :)
[02:13:31] <al_nz1> you have a row within a col, then full sized cols to force to new lines?
[02:13:45] <robertmaxrees> full-width columns.
[02:13:50] <al_nz1> yeah, that
[02:14:02] <robertmaxrees> the idea with bootstrap is you can easily support multiple viewports.
[02:14:04] <al_nz1> where would you place your data divs?
[02:14:11] <robertmaxrees> "data divs"?????
[02:14:26] <al_nz1> <div data-uid="12315423434134"></div>
[02:14:32] <robertmaxrees> you mean the data attribute?
[02:14:39] <al_nz1> yes
[02:14:45] <robertmaxrees> on a parent element for each person "row.
[02:14:47] <robertmaxrees> "
[02:15:22] <al_nz1> ala https://jsfiddle.net/bigalnz/ujs2k1ec/1/ ?
[02:15:32] <robertmaxrees> no no no
[02:15:36] <robertmaxrees> don't add new elements.
[02:16:03] <al_nz1> stick in the top level row?
[02:16:15] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bezmqrjd/
[02:16:24] <robertmaxrees> but back WAY up.
[02:16:35] <robertmaxrees> are you just looking to store the UID or is there other data, as well?
[02:17:54] <al_nz1> I will probably display name, address, dob, drivers license, social security, and also transfer data attributes for phone, email, UID
[02:18:09] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[02:18:13] <robertmaxrees> i give up.
[02:18:20] <robertmaxrees> changing reqs are a pet peeve.
[02:18:31] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[02:18:52] <al_nz1> huh
[02:19:07] <robertmaxrees> you said that you were just looking to store the uid
[02:19:17] <robertmaxrees> now there are suddenly other datapoints.
[02:19:35] <robertmaxrees> is there anything else you're looking to store?
[02:20:28] <al_nz1> nothing I can think of other than what I just mentioned
[02:20:41] <robertmaxrees> mk
[02:20:57] <robertmaxrees> you can also store objects within data attributes.  jquery makes dealing with that pretty trivial.
[02:21:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd read up on that
[02:21:13] <al_nz1> like javascript objects?
[02:22:03] <robertmaxrees> yes.  data-foo="{bar: 'text', baz: 123, qux: 'ljknfdp0820r'}"
[02:22:15] <robertmaxrees> check out the jquery api docs for $.fn.data
[02:22:23] <al_nz1> ok
[02:22:38] <al_nz1> I suppose a fiddle example is out of the question? :-)
[02:22:50] <robertmaxrees> a fiddle example of what?
[02:22:57] <robertmaxrees> a json object in a data attribute??
[02:24:08] <Cork> robertmaxrees: jquery .data() actually have support for that
[02:24:17] <robertmaxrees> Cork i'm well aware?
[02:24:25] <robertmaxrees> which is why i'm suggesting it??
[02:24:29] <Cork> ah
[02:24:36] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[02:24:47] <robertmaxrees> my confusion is this constant need for examples of things.
[02:24:51] <Cork> just dropped in and saw the last line and it looked like you where on the other end :)
[02:24:55] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[02:25:03] <Cork> ok, then *move along* :P
[02:25:06] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[02:25:21] <robertmaxrees> there's a reason i got mod a while ago :)
[02:42:09] <al_nz1> robertmaxrees: sorry had to run, young one needs me. Thanks a for your guidance
[02:43:20] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[02:43:22] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:59:23] <Xatenev> hi
[10:59:57] <Xatenev> if i have <body> // some script that has document ready and then uses libA inside document ready \n\n <script src="libA"></script>
[10:59:59] <Xatenev> should that work?
[11:00:16] <Xatenev> it tells me libA is not a function even though its in the document ready
[11:02:03] <Xatenev> it seems to work fine when i use defer instead of placing it at the bottom of body..
[11:16:18] <MikeD_> is $.each supposed to follow the array order in something like $.each( [1,2,3], myfunction ) ?
[11:27:05] <AdamPDotty> "instead of" …
[11:29:44] <AdamPDotty> yes, each is ordered
[12:51:43] <spinningCat> i need to to scroll jacking
[12:51:57] <spinningCat> is it a good plugin to do that? https://d4nyll.github.io/smartscroll/#keep-history
[13:22:47] <jak2000> hi all any page for run sql commands (sqlfiddle.com is down or i cant acces) https://paste.debian.net/1077006/ i need update a table but not work the update sql statment... say:  Unknown column 'tser.isini' in 'where clause'
[13:23:01] <robertmaxrees> jak2000 wrong channel :)
[13:23:45] <jak2000> sorry
[13:23:47] <jak2000> sorry...
[13:24:04] <jak2000> robertmaxrees solved the JSON problem in server side, with a library named GSON
[13:32:24] <spinningCat> is there an easy way to do sscrolljacking?
[13:32:42] <robertmaxrees> define "easy"
[13:33:01] <spinningCat> dont know one line may be :D
[13:33:06] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:33:14] <robertmaxrees> so scrolljacking is a broad term.
[13:33:14] <spinningCat> just joking
[13:33:23] <robertmaxrees> what, exactly, are you trying to accomplish?
[13:33:28] <spinningCat> well let me show you actualy problem
[13:33:31] <spinningCat> just a sec
[13:33:32] <robertmaxrees> fwiw you should really avoid scrolljacking in general.
[13:34:04] <spinningCat> so i need to avoid default scroll behaivour?
[13:34:15] <spinningCat> my problem is sorry btw context is Turkish
[13:34:16] <robertmaxrees> heh, why?
[13:34:16] <spinningCat> i have problem about scrolling. Normally when you hit up or down key of keyboard or muse rolling site works fine. But if you click + icon in the right pane of the page then hit the up key of keyboard. Site looks messy. But if traverse the page with mouse wheel everything works fine. What could be the possible reason http://test.bluesdernegi.cloud.mech.cx/
[13:34:42] <spinningCat> robertmaxrees,  dont know the reason first time i heard about scrolljacking
[13:35:15] <robertmaxrees> what's the code fixing when you press an arrow key?
[13:35:22] <robertmaxrees> make a small jsfiddle to demonstrate the problem.
[13:36:14] <robertmaxrees> oh
[13:36:25] <robertmaxrees> your current scroll js isn't even jquery my dude :)
[13:37:09] <spinningCat> what do you mean?
[13:37:17] <spinningCat> i am just calculating page height
[13:37:32] <spinningCat> and move scroll with that height
[13:37:37] <spinningCat> is it false approach?
[13:37:58] <robertmaxrees> you mean the stuff that starts with document.addEventListener('keydown', function(event){ ?
[13:38:01] <spinningCat> click + key and hit up key of keyboard you will see the problem
[13:38:11] <robertmaxrees> i see the problem, i'm saying it's not a jquery problem./
[13:38:11] <spinningCat> robertmaxrees,  yes
[13:38:17] <robertmaxrees> that's vanilla js.
[13:38:29] <spinningCat> hmm jquery is javascript
[13:38:35] <spinningCat> can you tell me the problem :D
[13:38:39] <robertmaxrees> right, but this code isn't using jquery :)
[13:38:49] <robertmaxrees> hit up ##javascript and they can get you going,.
[13:40:09] <spinningCat> i just asked there they told me about scrolljacking
[13:40:43] <robertmaxrees> no you didn't lol
[13:40:44] <spinningCat> if i change addEventListener like $/'selector').on(.. can you help me with that?
[13:40:53] <robertmaxrees> if you have questions about jquery, i can help.
[13:41:03] <robertmaxrees> but right now, you don't have you jquery question.
[13:41:08] <spinningCat> i did in javascript
[13:41:22] <spinningCat> I see
[13:41:28] <spinningCat> okay
[13:41:42] <robertmaxrees> when did you ask in ##javascript???
[13:42:37] <spinningCat> hmm
[13:42:41] <spinningCat> let me take a look
[13:43:12] <spinningCat> it was 19:30 in my time
[13:43:18] <spinningCat> what time is it there now?
[13:43:32] <robertmaxrees> 10:43am
[13:43:35] <spinningCat> i can tell you the exact time
[13:44:17] <robertmaxrees> i asked because i've been in that channel all morning here heh
[13:44:20] <spinningCat> well 11 hours you are back
[13:44:28] <robertmaxrees> so then you didn't "just ask"
[13:44:32] <spinningCat> well it must be 8:30 or something
[13:44:35] <robertmaxrees> or wait huh?
[13:44:52] <robertmaxrees> either way.
[13:44:54] <spinningCat> in my time i asked in 19:30 in your place time must be 8:30
[13:44:57] <robertmaxrees> hit up ##javascriupt and ask them.
[13:45:22] <spinningCat> you are in javascript can you help me there?
[13:45:35] <robertmaxrees> uh
[13:45:42] <robertmaxrees> i mean, i'm in there, but no guarantees.
[13:45:53] <robertmaxrees> don't understand what the big deal is lol
[13:45:59] <spinningCat> guarantees?
[13:46:13] <robertmaxrees> just go ask there.
[13:47:02] <spinningCat> i already asked if i do it will be second time
[13:47:13] <spinningCat> anyway i guess i couldnt get help from you about that
[13:49:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:49:44] <spinningCat> robertmaxrees,  with all my respect i asked that there
[13:49:52] <spinningCat> if i do second time it is meaningless
[13:49:57] <robertmaxrees> :shrug:
[13:50:07] <robertmaxrees> the lack of response in another channel doesn't change the topic of this one :)
[13:50:34] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you're being so resistant to asking there lol
[13:51:29] <spinningCat> in javascript?
[13:51:40] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:51:45] <robertmaxrees> anyway.  good luck! :)
[13:52:44] <spinningCat> i guess it is js problem
[13:52:54] <spinningCat> i mean it works fine with muse wheel
[13:53:01] <spinningCat> there is a problem in keydown event
[13:53:17] <spinningCat> thanks
[14:56:10] <spinningCat> i found the error
[14:56:21] <robertmaxrees> cool
