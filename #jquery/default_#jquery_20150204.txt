[00:01:50] <wheeei^^> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/tn0e0upy/ need to get thur & fr to the top of the list with jQuery
[00:02:33] <wheeei^^> Cork I figured out the correct selector, it works great to select the last item. Now I just need to find a way to target the parent so I can prepend it
[00:03:10] <Cork> wheeei^^: the context i asked about is missing
[00:03:26] <Cork> meaning is this from a click on the button
[00:03:28] <Cork> on page load
[00:03:31] <Cork> ... what?
[00:03:48] <Cork> do you have a "this" referencing something in the list?
[00:03:52] <wheeei^^> no
[00:04:05] <kokut> Hello, I'm working on a PHP script that contains jQuery that requests a .php file that returns a list depending on the request and appends it to the element, what i dont know is how to fetch the data from the requested php file
[00:04:37] <wheeei^^> its not on anything, I just wanna move it up, Cork think that In the browser with chrome devtools console and want to move it up with a jquery command... no function or click
[00:04:39] <Cork> kokut: the the php script generating html or what?
[00:05:24] <kokut> cork, the first one is like a page, when the client clicks on a list it requests a new list based on the element selected
[00:06:16] <Cork> wheeei^^: http://jsfiddle.net/tn0e0upy/2/ ?
[00:06:35] <kokut> the requested php should have a function that uses GET from the request and returns anyhthing, i dont even know what it should return im really new at this
[00:06:36] <Cork> kokut: define "list"
[00:06:56] <Cork> is it an array?, an <ul> a <table> ... what?
[00:07:11] <kokut> tell me what it should be
[00:07:17] <Cork> ...
[00:07:25] <wheeei^^> Cork doesnt seem to work, thur and fr is still on the bottom of the list?
[00:07:29] <Uhkis> :D
[00:07:33] <kokut> i dont know about this if its an array its probably better i'm not sure
[00:08:11] <Cork> bah typo from an older version...
[00:08:13] <kokut> but yea a <select> with many <option> will do
[00:08:32] <Cork> wheeei^^: http://jsfiddle.net/tn0e0upy/3/
[00:08:57] <Cork> kokut: you need to provide the context of the question
[00:09:11] <Cork> meaning where do you need to use the "list" what should the "list" be used for
[00:09:24] <Cork> and how is the "list" data formated from php resource
[00:09:42] <kokut> i need to append the list to a div
[00:09:45] <Cork> without that we can only give you "suggestions on how to make ajax calls"
[00:10:02] <Cork> $(target).append(list)
[00:10:16] <kokut> in the div there is another list there, when the user selects an element the ajax request a new list to append below it
[00:10:22] <kokut> its for selecting nested categories
[00:10:28] <kokut> i've seen it in other sites
[00:10:37] <Cork> kokut: you realize you still haven't specified what "list" is?
[00:10:43] <kokut> like cars->red->ford w/e
[00:10:47] <Cork> >_<'
[00:10:55] <Cork> DEFINE LIST!!!
[00:10:56] <Vipul_> Is there anyone who can help me on this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28277569/close-bootstrap-popover-event-is-conflicting-with-jquery-validation-plugin. I'm stuck in this hell spot from last few days.
[00:11:02] <kokut> in my case its an html element <select> with many <option>
[00:11:19] <Cork> ok, and the php resource returns html or what do you have there?
[00:12:01] <kokut> i havent made that yet i was hoping you could tell me what it should return, i've never done this, maybe the best approach would be to return the whole html thing to append it
[00:12:27] <kokut> the first list works with a PHP array fetched from the database
[00:12:37] <Joonaa> it doesnt work on the page, but you can see the seek bar now at least... when the song is playing, it gets updated every second, but it also updates while user is moving the seek bar slider (which i dont want) http://jsfiddle.net/rum5LLhq/1/
[00:12:40] <kokut> but if i'm not refreshing the page i dont know how could i add another list there
[00:12:56] <kokut> without using ajax
[00:13:08] <Cork> ok, so you have a php array
[00:13:16] <kokut> yea for the first list
[00:13:18] <Cork> kokut: then you have two options
[00:13:42] <Cork> either format html server side <option></option>
[00:13:50] <Cork> and echo this list on the ajax call
[00:13:55] <kokut> yea its ok
[00:13:59] <Cork> or you can create a json_encode
[00:14:02] <Cork> and return json from php
[00:14:14] <Cork> and have js build the option elements
[00:14:19] <kokut> that sounds nice but i've never done it
[00:14:44] <kokut> im gonna go with the first option for now
[00:15:40] <kokut> So, the requested php file will return a html that will get appended and thats it?
[00:16:06] <Cork> kokut: you could either do $('select').load('url')
[00:16:12] <Cork> if you want to completely replace the content
[00:16:23] <kokut> yea that would be nice
[00:16:27] <Cork> or you would use $.get() and append it manually
[00:16:31] <kokut> because the client might select a different value
[00:16:54] <kokut> k let me try it
[00:23:25] <Joonaa> alright i posted my question to stackoverflow http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28316643/detecting-user-dragging-range-type-input
[00:25:11] <Xatenev> Hey #CorksDojo
[00:35:57] <wheeei^^> can you select an item based on their value they have in text?
[00:36:59] <wheeei^^> oh yeah contains! :)
[00:48:15] <Cork> wheeei^^: yes you can, but you should use that as a last resort, always try to do it with a class or attribute if possible
[00:48:44] <wheeei^^> Cork I got a new idea now, target a smaller element thats more specific and then go to the grandparent of that element
[00:49:28] <wheeei^^> Cork found a value attribut on a smaller element inside the li Im after
[00:50:34] <wheeei^^> Cork Im DEF on my last restort, have loads to do and been stuck on this for over over an hour now
[00:51:12] <Cork> wheeei^^: simplest is to just add a class to the html fro mthe backend
[00:51:40] <wheeei^^> Cork sadly dont have access to the backend and there is not html to edit, its all generated through js
[00:51:52] <wheeei^^> and I dont have access to edit that js
[00:52:00] <Cork> ouch
[00:52:13] <wheeei^^> yeah this is nightmare task... damn job interview challange...
[00:52:42] <Cork> you might be able to do it based on the dom structure
[00:55:34] <wheeei^^> Cork I got progress!!! I managed to select the grandchild in the li i wanna move
[00:56:06] <wheeei^^> Now I just need to find the nearest li-parent, I know thats possible and then append that to the nearest ul :P
[00:56:52] <Cork> wheeei^^: .closest('li')
[00:57:06] <wheeei^^> Cork that gos up the dom?
[00:57:08] <wheeei^^> goes*
[00:57:10] <Cork> yes
[00:57:14] <wheeei^^> thx! =)
[00:57:16] <Cork> it ONLY goes up
[00:57:24] <Cork> nothing else
[00:58:03] <steelbrain> wheeei^^: You have a cool name by the way :D
[00:58:29] <wheeei^^> steelbrain haha thx
[01:01:41] <wheeei^^> F~**** back on page 1 again they alla have the same value :(
[01:02:14] <Cork> wheeei^^: what are you trying to do?
[01:02:20] <wheeei^^> Can't see any difference on the li-elements than the label name they have, have to go back to contain again
[01:03:32] <wheeei^^> Cork same thing as before, weirdly enough your solution found others hidden li-elements I cant find and put 8 li elements instead of only 1 , tried other nth-child selectors and nothing works because my selectors aint unique enough
[01:03:54] <Cork> wheeei^^: i meant why do you need to "find the li"?
[01:04:07] <Cork> what is it you're trying to do
[01:04:13] <wheeei^^> I need to move it up to the top
[01:04:35] <Cork> are you trying to sort the list or something?
[01:05:03] <wheeei^^> well the assignment is to move one of the days to the front instead...
[01:05:20] <Cork> ah
[01:06:13] <Cork> wheeei^^: couldn't you use the value field in the input element?
[01:06:31] <wheeei^^> nah apparently they all have the same value :(
[01:06:42] <Cork> they don't in the fiddle you provided
[01:07:11] <wheeei^^> hmm true, thats weird hold on
[01:08:59] <wheeei^^> wtf haha when I added a test line to .remove() the the element with tufre it changed all li items to tufre and removed the first element with value "di" This is getting silly
[01:09:32] <Cork> i suspect you're selectors is the problem
[01:10:18] <Cork> wheeei^^: anyway http://jsfiddle.net/tn0e0upy/4/
[01:10:47] <Cork> wheeei^^: also run console.log($('input[value="tufr"]').length)
[01:11:03] <wheeei^^> Cork YES, THANX!!!! <3
[01:11:08] <wheeei^^> it worked :D:D
[01:11:34] <Cork> make sure you understand what you made wrong
[01:11:51] <Cork> kinda point less to solve a problem in a job intervew if you don't know what was wrong :)
[01:12:01] <wheeei^^> even if I didnt get this job I have never learned so much during 48 hours
[01:19:24] <Vipul_> http://jsfiddle.net/dwdh8xqz/  wasn't working, but http://jsfiddle.net/dwdh8xqz/2/ is working fine. I don't understand whats the exact difference between the two. Earlier I was trying to use jquery closest() to hide popover (that too was working fine but issue was with input focusout event) and now I used input name to find nearest popover and this one is working in both cases, is it crazy or I missed something ?
[01:19:42] <Vipul_> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28277569/close-bootstrap-popover-event-is-conflicting-with-jquery-validation-plugin
[01:29:09] <abailarri> Hello. I'm trying to trigger a function onclick a div but it not works. http://jsfiddle.net/31f7dbsg/6/ Any suggestion please?
[01:29:42] <Cork> abailarri: don't use event attributes
[01:29:45] <Cork> use event listeners
[01:29:53] <Cork> ?api on
[01:29:53] <b-ot> Cork: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[01:30:10] <abailarri> Cork, I know, but is necesary to make like this
[01:30:11] <kokut> how do you get the value of an option instead of the element's content? I'm doing: var fetchId = $( "#cat option:selected" ).text(); and instead of returning the value of the option its returning the content inside <option></option> :\
[01:30:28] <Cork> kokut: .val()
[01:30:45] <Cork> or actaully
[01:30:49] <xec> abailarri: jsfiddle wraps your code in dom ready unless you specify no wrap: http://jsfiddle.net/31f7dbsg/7/
[01:30:52] <Cork> better use .prop('value')
[01:30:59] <negusnegesti> Hello guys!
[01:30:59] <negusnegesti> I have a funny behaviour when I receive the values of all input prompts within a certain div-container.
[01:30:59] <negusnegesti> Even though the initial value of that input-field is 0, with console.log() I see the value always as 1.
[01:30:59] <negusnegesti> Do you have experience with that weird behaviour and do you know a solution?
[01:30:59] <negusnegesti> THX a lot in advance...
[01:31:10] <sacho> Vipul_, "doesn't working" "is working fine" is meaningless to us
[01:31:14] <sacho> doesn't work*
[01:31:34] <sacho> it seems like in both fiddles, clicking the close button closest the popup.
[01:32:03] <kokut> Cork: like $("#cat").prop('value'); ?
[01:32:09] <Cork> kokut: yes
[01:32:13] <kokut> k
[01:32:16] <sacho> if #cat is an option
[01:32:33] <abailarri> Ok, this was a little issue with jsfiddle. My real question is that the fadeOut() callback not waits for fadeout finish, then, is a fadeout bug? http://jsfiddle.net/31f7dbsg/10/
[01:32:48] <abailarri> If you click on Principios not whait for aaaa desapear
[01:34:04] <Vipul_> sacho, but I think both should be working. In first case its $('input[name="'+$(this).data('elem')+'"]').next().popover('hide'); 	}); and second fiddle its $(this).closest('div.popover').popover('hide');, both must have worked .. I dont understand the difference between the two.
[01:34:42] <sacho> abailarri, http://jsfiddle.net/31f7dbsg/13/
[01:35:11] <sacho> it's probably not a good idea to apply an animation to multiple elements, my guess is the complete is fired when the fadeout of the non-visible one finishes, which is instant
[01:35:14] <xec> abailarri: fading out something that is not visible completes immediately
[01:35:48] <xec> i see sacho already figured it out :)
[01:35:52] <abailarri> xec, sacho thanks, I don't know
[01:35:54] <abailarri> Now I know
[01:35:55] <abailarri> jeje
[01:50:09] <lejocelyn> Hi
[01:50:39] <lejocelyn> I thought there was a generic way to convert json string to javascript object, was I wrong ?
[01:51:28] <lejocelyn> do I have to create a specific fonction for creating an javascript object from my json ?
[01:52:15] <arup_r> I am working on some page.. where on selection of a color.. the items color is changing... There is some JS code is getting executed I know.. Can I see which JS code is getting evaluated in the Chrome console.. Any tricks for this?
[01:55:27] <kokut> Anyone knows how to store the contents returned by .load('url') or something instead of loading it right away? because i need to append it instead of replacing it.
[01:59:20] <xec> kokut: don't use .load() - try $.get() or something else, then you can do whatever you like with the result
[01:59:56] <Mark_2> are there any 3d plugin for jquery?
[02:00:13] <Cork> Mark_2: 3d?
[02:00:18] <wheeei-AFK> is it ugly code if you write 10 lines of $('.someClass').remove(); or is it okay? Dunno if there is a way to delete several random elements that have nothing to do with eachother in one line...
[02:00:20] <Cork> for css3 you mean?
[02:00:30] <Mark_2> papervision3d for instance.
[02:00:38] <Cork> wheeei-AFK: separate them with comma
[02:00:40] <Cork> (in the string)
[02:01:07] <wheeei-AFK> Cork is that better to put them as many as possible in one line?
[02:01:23] <wheeei-AFK> I guess the code will look cleaner
[02:01:26] <Cork> wheeei-AFK: depends
[02:01:56] <Cork> Mark_2: ok so canvas
[02:02:06] <Cork> Mark_2: jquery is for handling dom elements, not canvas
[02:02:15] <Cork> so you should prob look elsewhere
[02:02:50] <Mark_2> i see.
[02:03:11] <Mark_2> is it possible to create this kind of animation only using jquery? http://desimer.com/experiment/red/
[02:03:39] <Mark_2> or do i have to look for others?
[02:03:44] <Cork> ugg flash
[02:04:02] <Cork> <-- doesn't have flash so can't say
[02:04:32] <xec> Mark_2: if you're referring to the fade in/ slide in, then sure
[02:04:55] <wheeei-AFK> sry for all the questions but I dont really have a preference for doing things in jquery yet...
[02:05:46] <Cork> wheeei-AFK: it's, fine
[02:06:24] <wheeei-AFK> Cork what do you think is the best way to select a class that is unique and specific... $('p.my-specific-Class') or $('.my-specific-Class')
[02:06:31] <kokut> thanks xec gonna give it a try
[02:06:52] <Cork> wheeei-AFK: if you don't have to care if it is a p or not, then the later
[02:07:07] <Cork> if it can be on other elements and should only match if it is on the p add that
[02:07:21] <Cork> wheeei-AFK: basically you should let selectors be as simple as possible
[02:07:42] <wheeei-AFK> ok thats what I thought because maybe later you want to change it from a p to a h2 and not break the code
[02:07:54] <Cork> well that too
[02:08:04] <Cork> but the selector works better for the browser too
[02:08:18] <wheeei-AFK> dont the browser find it quicker the more specific you are_
[02:08:19] <wheeei-AFK> ?
[02:08:51] <wheeei-AFK> the browser should find p.class quicker, no? It only have to search the P-tags instead of the whole dom
[02:09:05] <Mark_2> wait, jquery doesn’t control animation does it?
[02:09:20] <Mark_2> is ‘animate’ css3 or jquery?
[02:09:40] <wheeei-AFK> Mark_2 I think jquery uses css3 to animate
[02:09:51] <Mark_2> suddnly finds oneself confused*
[02:15:00] <wheeei-AFK> Mark_2 if write $('#overlay').fadeIn(400);	 with jQuery , it uses css transitions to fade it in...
[02:15:07] <wheeei-AFK> if you*
[02:15:09] <Mark_2> yeah.
[02:15:14] <Mark_2> thanks.
[02:20:41] <kokut> I have a $('select').append(newElements); and it doesn't work, and $('select').html(newElements); clears the container. var newElements = $.get('url'); and it works because i can see it in the console, what am i missing?
[02:25:18] <kokut> var newElements = $.get('url'); is working, but $('select').append(newElements); doesn't work, what's missing?
[02:31:03] <tlkr> kokut, $.get is an asyncronous request, i'm not sure what .get actually returns but the data isn't available until the request completes, look at the success callback function http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/
[02:33:46] <Cork> it returns a jqxhr object
[02:33:55] <Cork> but ya you can't append it sync
[02:34:15] <Cork> $.get('url').done(function(data) { $('select').append(data); });
[02:37:32] <Omar-> or load content inside a hidden "placeholder" http://jsfiddle.net/bhkwcmwg/ select options are saved here http://jsfiddle.net/yzjcumre/
[02:37:56] <Omar-> what do you think about that, Cork?
[02:38:11] <Cork> Omar-: you don't want to append things to the dom if you don't need to
[02:38:19] <Cork> especially invalid html
[02:38:54] <Omar-> the place holder is removed after re-appending retrieved elements
[02:39:14] <Cork> ya, so you do 3 dom modifications + some selectors
[02:39:14] <Omar-> so in your opinion $.get is better combined with .done
[02:39:20] <Cork> when you could just do a single append
[02:39:28] <Omar-> yup
[02:39:35] <Cork> Omar-: or $.get(url, function() {})
[02:39:43] <Omar-> I tried get just now but I'm not getting it
[02:39:44] <Cork> but yes i normally prefer to use deferred
[02:39:51] <Omar-> maybe i didn't combine it with done
[02:39:51] <Cork> the code becomes more readable
[02:41:04] <Omar-> Cork I forgot to add a second arguement $.get("url", function () {}, "html
[02:41:13] <Omar-> Cork I forgot to add a second arguement $.get("url", function () {}, "html");
[02:41:30] <Cork> Omar-: the third isn't normally needed
[02:41:43] <Cork> it is normally the default action for the server anyway
[02:41:57] <Omar-> I found it helpful, as I had used it in one of my answers http://stackoverflow.com/a/22405776/
[02:42:14] <Omar-> yea? never knew that
[02:42:51] <Cork> Omar-: ya... stack over flow is... stack overflow
[02:43:04] <Omar-> lol
[02:43:09] <Omar-> it truly is
[02:43:19] <Omar-> i stopped contributing to it anyway
[02:43:25] <Omar-> divorce!
[02:43:31] <Cork> for some reason i find it sucks more for jquery then basically any other language
[02:43:50] <Cork> prob cause jquery has changed so much over the years
[02:44:01] <Cork> and ppl don't keep up with the changes before answering
[02:44:08] <Omar-> Cork it does.. check this tweet https://twitter.com/jQM_Tricks/status/562662387632046081
[02:44:09] <b-ot> Omar-: @jQM_Tricks: Do you want to get "easy reputation" rapidly on #stackoverflow? Answer trivial and repeated #jquery questions.
[02:44:50] <Omar-> Cork they "hunt" for easy, stupid, nonsense questions to answer
[02:45:13] <Cork> Omar-: and answer it with solutions that was true 3-4 years ago
[02:45:16] <Cork> and plain wrong today
[02:45:33] <Omar-> ture
[02:45:44] <Omar-> users are after "rep" only
[02:46:03] <Cork> there was a user in here yesterday that scared the shit out of me
[02:46:15] <Omar-> haha why?
[02:46:18] <Cork> he had the "it works" approach on valid html...
[02:46:36] <Cork> so he throw random things into the page, and as long as it "worked" it muse be correct
[02:46:45] <Omar-> lol
[02:46:57] <Omar-> "stackoverflow told him its correct"
[02:47:03] <Cork> like <table><tr><div></div></tr><p></p><i></i></table
[02:47:19] <Omar-> wonderful markup
[02:47:23] <Cork> and wanted me to help him write dom selectors for that...
[02:47:43] <Cork> and got upset when i didn't want to before he fixed his broken html...
[02:48:16] <Cork> i thought we had left tag soup behind us...
[02:48:21] <Cork> but apparently not
[02:49:45] <Xatenev> Hello guys
[02:49:50] <Omar-> some ppl takes it personally when you tell them the truth and that their current problem cant be solved without solving the major problem
[02:50:10] <Omar-> Cork on SO, they answer without explaining
[02:50:14] <Cork> well it can be solved, but you're trying to build a host on quicksand
[02:50:17] <Omar-> hi Xatenev
[02:50:25] <Cork> and then you wonder why the walls wobble
[02:50:43] <Cork> host==house
[02:52:13] <Uhkis> Cork: talking about the guy who kept coming back with different nicks and the same fiddle? :D
[02:52:34] <Cork> Uhkis: i only saw him once
[02:52:40] <Xatenev> Uhkis: lo, why would u do that
[02:52:42] <Cork> was quite busy yesterday
[02:53:13] <Uhkis> Cork: that guy was on december iirc
[02:53:14] <Cork> Xatenev: they think ppl will answer the question if they don't recognize that it comes from the lazy person
[02:53:19] <Cork> it's happened before
[02:53:25] <Cork> Uhkis: ah, him
[02:53:29] <Cork> no this happend yesterday
[02:53:54] <Cork> <table><tr><div></div></tr><p></p><i></i></table> <-- he wanted to toggle the comment (p element) in this structure
[02:54:14] <Cork> YES div inside tr and i and p directly inside table...
[02:54:29] <Xatenev> lol
[02:54:32] <Xatenev> the markup is real
[02:54:32] <Xatenev> :D
[02:54:47] <Cork> well at lest he closed his p tags...
[02:54:48] <Uhkis> well at least it closes the tags in proper order :D
[02:54:55] <Cork> heh ya :)
[02:55:10] <Cork> also he fiddled php code
[02:55:28] <Cork> and though it was too much hassle to give the resulting html
[02:55:50] <Uhkis> i've seen a few horrifying php scripts on this channel
[02:55:55] <Cork> (wanted to avoid jsfiddle for this reason)
[03:00:32] <Cork> ah, nice looks like he actually listened at the end
[03:00:51] <Omar-> did you find his SO question?
[03:01:14] <Cork> wasn't on so
[03:01:18] <Cork> it was in here
[03:01:26] <Cork> https://pastee.org/c6c45
[03:02:09] <Cork> ah, i remembered wrong
[03:02:23] <Cork> it was <table><tr>(text)</tr>
[03:02:25] <Cork> not div...
[03:02:48] <tlkr> o.O
[03:03:26] <Omar-> but still the markup is invalid, isn't?
[03:03:33] <Cork> its very invalid
[03:03:56] <Cork> you can't create a row without columns
[03:04:04] <Cork> at lest unless you let it collapse (no content)
[03:04:55] <Omar-> true
[03:05:02] <Cork> <table><tr>(text)</tr><tr>(text)</tr><i>(text)</i><p>(text)</p><tr><div>(text)</div></tr></table>
[03:05:10] <Cork> lovely html isn't it? >_<'
[03:05:32] * xec throws up a little
[03:05:45] <Omar-> haha
[03:05:59] <Joonaa> looks good to me!
[03:06:03] <Omar-> xec you know KOjs, right?
[03:06:05] <Cork> heh
[03:06:17] <xec> Omar-: yes. at least to some degree ;)
[03:06:17] <Xatenev> Joonaa has been banned from #jquery
[03:06:18] <Xatenev> :o
[03:06:25] <Joonaa> D>
[03:06:27] <Joonaa> D:*
[03:06:43] <kokut> var newElements = $.get('url'); is working, but $('select').append(newElements); doesn't work, what's missing?
[03:06:49] <Omar-> xec i talked to you once on KO channel, but you were in a hurry
[03:06:58] <Cork> kokut: i already answered that a little back
[03:07:02] <Cork> scroll up and read it
[03:07:13] <xec> Omar-: right. you're the one with the crazy so score. i remember ;)
[03:07:20] <Cork> ~30 mins ago
[03:07:39] <Omar-> xec lol 25k is normal on SO
[03:07:52] <xec> way to make me feel inferior ;D
[03:07:53] <kokut> found it
[03:08:27] <Omar-> xec I wanted to discuss this answer of mine http://stackoverflow.com/a/21253357/4469330
[03:08:54] <Omar-> I find it dirty, although it "fixes" the problem
[03:09:11] <kokut> what is data in function(data) ?
[03:09:46] <baako> guys is jquery mobile used for app which are targeted for smartphone/ tablet users?
[03:09:47] <Omar-> kokut data is the retrieved html
[03:10:00] <Omar-> baako both
[03:10:12] <Omar-> desktop also. it's responsive
[03:10:43] <baako> so if you are using jquery mobile is they a point in using the normal jquery as well?
[03:11:15] <Omar-> baako you cant use jQM without jQ-core
[03:11:34] <Omar-> jQM depends onjQ-core and should be loaded before jQM.js
[03:11:41] <baako> Omar-: so it other to use jquery mobile i need <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery.min.js"></script>
[03:11:42] <baako> ?
[03:12:01] <kokut> Holy shit it works !!
[03:12:02] <Omar-> yup, you need jquery.js
[03:12:18] <kokut> somewhere in my brain a couple of neurons just died of happiness
[03:12:33] <kokut> thanks Omar-, Cork
[03:13:11] <baako> Omar-: what is the difference between jquery.js and jquery.min file
[03:14:34] <Uhkis> jquery.min is incomplete filename? ;)
[03:14:56] <xec> Omar-: sorry I don't really know enough jqmobile to even understand the question
[03:15:03] <baako> add .js to the end Uhkis
[03:16:01] <Omar-> baako min.js is compressed file i guess its called "gzip".
[03:16:08] <Omar-> kokut you're welcome
[03:16:23] <Omar-> xec it's okay, thanks for taking the time to read it :)
[03:16:35] <xec> .min.js means it's minified, not compressed
[03:16:40] <baako> Omar-: i used jquery.min.js instead of the jquery.js is they an down side to that?
[03:17:00] <Omar-> baako not at all
[03:17:18] <xec> baako: the downside is it's harder to debug jquery core (it's all one line now), but you're unlikely to need that
[03:17:24] <Omar-> baako use jq.js for debugging
[03:17:41] <xec> baako: the upside is it's a smaller file, quicker to download
[03:20:02] <baako> Omar- and xec thanks
[03:21:11] <Omar-> np
[03:39:51] <wheeei^^> to move one element into another with jquery can I simply select a element and use .prependTo or do I need to detach it first?
[03:40:04] <wheeei^^> Cork there we are ;D
[03:40:33] <Cork> elements can only have one parent
[03:40:46] <Cork> so appending/prepending/after/before will always move it
[03:40:50] <Cork> unless you clone it first
[03:43:12] <wheeei^^> Cork ok thx, damn I hate this code
[03:44:10] <wheeei^^> always 4 elements that are the same but 3 is hidden >_< ugly
[03:44:37] <Cork> wheeei^^: you could try :visible
[03:44:41] <wheeei^^> it seems like when you use .prependTo it also shows the elements that was hidden earlier ;P
[03:44:41] <Cork> its not pretty but...
[03:45:06] <wheeei^^> oh thats cool, I will try and see if I can find if the visible one belong to something instead
[03:49:16] <Cork> wheeei^^: well if the element is hidden by a parent getting display: none or something like that
[03:49:24] <Cork> moving the element out from there will make i visible again
[03:52:39] <wheeei^^> Cork I think I found a good selector but it didnt move the object, it copied it
[03:52:53] <Cork> uh
[03:53:02] <Cork> that isn't likely
[03:53:27] <wheeei^^> are u sure? I think I remember having to detach elements when moving from one node into another in pure javascript
[03:53:50] <Cork> i'm very sure
[03:54:09] <Cork> dom works by elements having a parentNode referencing it's parent
[03:54:21] <Cork> only way to add it to a new position is to replace this value
[03:54:28] <wheeei^^> what do you use detach for ?
[03:54:30] <Cork> meaning it can't possibly have a reference to the old one
[03:54:37] <Cork> it sets the parentNode reference to null
[03:55:12] <Cork> wheeei^^: sorry misread the question
[03:55:26] <Cork> wheeei^^: you use detatch if you want to completely remove the element from the dom
[03:55:33] <Cork> but still keep it around
[03:55:39] <Cork> so you can add it back again later
[03:56:18] <wheeei^^> and just by .detach() ?
[03:56:31] <Cork> what?
[03:56:49] <wheeei^^> I just have to write the selector and then add .detach();
[03:57:06] <wheeei^^> $('#id').find('.classt').detach();
[03:58:36] <wheeei^^> it worked like I said
[03:58:43] <wheeei^^> first detaching then adding it back in
[03:59:21] <wheeei^^> Thats how I remember doing it a few years ago (rusty)
[04:00:32] <mirko> i'm having an issue with an ajax call which returns a nested JSON-dict. dataType ist set to 'json' which according doc implicitly passes the result to parseJSON before handing over to the success handler. However I can only access the nested bits if i explicitly use parseJSON beforehand.
[04:00:53] <mirko> otherwise i get an 'undefined'
[04:02:30] <sacho> what's the data you are getting as a result?
[04:03:00] <mirko> sacho: {"city": "Entenhausen", "name": "FooBar GmbH", "house_nr": "23", "country": {"code": "BJ", "id": 23, "name": "Benin"}, "notes": "Dummy client", "entity": 0, "phone": "+49(0)30 1234567", "street": "Foobarstr.", "email": "foo@bar", "date_created": "2015-01-02T15:30:00+00:00", "id": 1, "zip_code": "12345"}
[04:03:28] <mirko> it's stored in <data> - data.email is fine, as the others - except data.country.name
[04:03:34] <mirko> or data.country.id
[04:03:56] <mirko> however if i use $.parseJSON(data) (again explicitly) I can access those values that way
[04:04:29] <sacho> try making a fiddle with your problem
[04:04:45] <EdwardIII> hey, is there a way when i'm getting an event that's bubbled up using delegation, i can see what the original class/object that was clicked was?
[04:04:52] <sacho> you can add your response to a file and $.get() that
[04:04:53] <mirko> sacho: ack
[04:05:05] <Cork> mirko: are you sure it is "country": {"code": "BJ", "id": 23, "name": "Benin"}
[04:05:14] <sacho> EdwardIII, event.target
[04:05:19] <Cork> and not "country": "{\"code\": \"BJ\", \"id\": 23, \"name\": \"Benin\"}"
[04:05:58] <mirko> Cork: http://pastebin.com/HTm4Jyw6
[04:06:10] <mirko> i pasted the output from the console.log call
[04:06:30] <Cork> mirko: what is the content-type the server is returning?
[04:06:36] <Cork> (http header)
[04:06:55] <Cork> mirko: dataType sets the http request accept header
[04:07:04] <Cork> it doesn't override what data type the server says it sends
[04:07:20] <mirko> Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8
[04:07:46] <Cork> mirko: look in the browsers network tab and copy the raw text the server sends
[04:07:51] <Cork> and make sure things isn't double encoded
[04:08:03] <Cork> cause this should work with what you say you have
[04:09:50] <mirko> Cork: i'm trying to create a minimal case
[04:10:28] <Cork> is the /json/client/get/1 resource accessable publically?
[04:11:02] <mirko> Cork: unfortunately not
[04:11:16] <Cork> before you create a testcase check the raw data from the server
[04:11:30] <Cork> cause that is basically the only thing left that can cause this
[04:11:39] <EdwardIII> sacho: of course, damnit thanks!
[04:12:33] <sacho> except for solar flares
[04:12:45] <Cork> heh true :D
[04:12:59] <Cork> when it doubt, blame the sun
[04:13:21] <mirko> ohh..
[04:13:45] <Cork> i guess someone found the problem :)
[04:13:55] <mirko> "{\"city\": \"Entenhausen\", \"name\": \"FooBar GmbH\", \"house_nr\": \"23\", \"country\": {\"code\": \"BJ\", \"id\": 23, \"name\": \"Benin\"}, \"notes\": \"Dummy client\", \"entity\": 0, \"phone\": \"+49(0)30 1234567\", \"street\": \"Foobarstr.\", \"email\": \"foo@bar\", \"date_created\": \"2015-01-02T15:30:00+00:00\", \"id\": 1, \"zip_code\": \"12345\"}"
[04:14:04] <Cork> yup :)
[04:14:07] <mirko> of course console.log doesn't show it
[04:14:21] <mirko> .a is however still wondering, why he can access values on the first level
[04:14:35] <mirko> and why cascading parseJSON makes a difference
[04:14:53] <Cork> ya, that sounds weird
[04:14:55] <mirko> s#\.a#/me#g
[04:15:03] <Cork> shouldn't work with that json
[04:16:47] <prohobo> solar flares gave me a fake backend error yesterday
[04:16:53] <prohobo> had to restart the server
[04:20:16] <EdwardIII> solar flares?
[04:20:22] <EdwardIII> did they make you really aggressive too?
[04:20:59] <Cork> weee
[04:21:04] <xec> yay netsplit
[04:30:42] <mirko> Cork: either way - thanks a lot!
[04:30:47] <Cork> np
[04:38:50] <fenix849> im having an issue with the jquery plugin select2 and remote json data, can i ask about plugins here?
[04:41:00] <phpcoder> hello everybody
[04:41:00] <phpcoder> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/6d023c428297375d75b1
[04:41:13] <phpcoder> the first time it works... the second not
[04:41:24] <phpcoder> i load content with .html() from an ajax call
[04:41:35] <phpcoder> i have seen live() is deprecated
[04:41:41] <phpcoder> now i use $(".btn-new-message").on('click', function(event) { .. }
[04:41:55] <phpcoder> but it has not been triggered the second time
[04:42:21] <lugzer_> hi
[04:44:45] <Cork> ?api delegate
[04:44:45] <b-ot> Cork: .delegate(): Attach a handler to one or more events for all elements that match the selector, now or in the future, based on a specific set of root elements. http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[04:44:50] <Cork> phpcoder: ^
[04:44:55] <Cork> read that page
[04:45:07] <phpcoder> Cork, i fixed it doing:         $( document ).on( 'click', '.btn-new-message', function(event) {
[04:45:28] <Cork> that would have been the result from reading that page ya :)
[04:46:00] <Cork> phpcoder: though $("#compose-modal") is prob a better option then $(document)
[04:47:30] <phpcoder> eheh
[04:47:31] <phpcoder> okay!
[04:47:33] <phpcoder> thanks
[04:51:13] <lugzer_> can anyone explain why scrollTop() is not giving me the pixel value of some div placed on a page? it is always 0..
[04:52:02] <Cork> scrollTop says how much the element is scrolled, not pixel offset from the parent
[04:52:21] <Cork> you want position().top
[04:53:19] <amore123> Cork, we were talking yesterday about the ajax requests and the go back button in the browser. To keep update the webpage after going back you told me this: "the best solution would be to use either a hash mark and update as you change  and then check it on back. Alternatively use history.replaceState". My question now is: do you consider better using the hash instead of the History variable since you say it is an "alternative
[04:53:19] <amore123> "? the using the history is also ok?
[04:53:48] <Cork> "Alternatively use history.replaceState"
[04:54:00] <Cork> it's in you're quote...
[04:54:09] <lugzer> Cork: thanks
[04:54:28] <amore123> yes, but is that also a good solution? or it is better using hashes?
[04:54:53] <Cork> hash has better backwards compatibility
[04:55:02] <Cork> but that is about the only difference
[04:56:22] <Cork> amore123: one thing is if you use the replaceState you can add a value that will be sent to the server
[04:56:44] <Cork> so you could know about this server side with that solution
[04:57:40] <amore123> but should I send a request to server in my case? if yes, for what?
[04:58:45] <amore123> Actually Im starting to read some info about, history.pushState, replaceState.. I didn't know anything abouth them
[05:10:42] <Cork> amore123: like i've said several times these things isn't called in this case to do anything
[05:10:50] <Cork> it is to store a value you can later check for
[05:11:03] <Cork> that is all it is done for
[05:11:37] <lejocelyn> In javascript, can I have a call to a function that doesn't specify all the parameters ? for a recursive function to which I want a default value for a parameter
[05:12:26] <MikeD_> lejocelyn:  are you talking about currying?
[05:12:44] <lejocelyn> MikeD_: I don't know what is currying :(
[05:12:46] <MikeD_> or some way to fake named parameters?
[05:12:57] <lejocelyn> result_object = typeof a !== 'undefined' ? a : []; ?
[05:13:57] <lejocelyn> I though that would be ternary
[05:14:14] <lejocelyn> I'd like a default value for a function
[05:15:04] <MikeD_> and why doesn't that work for you?
[05:15:31] <lejocelyn> it works but it looks like a very dodgy hack to me
[05:16:17] <Cork> lejocelyn: es6 introduces default values
[05:16:25] <Cork> es5 defaults to undefined
[05:16:29] <MikeD_> if you really are expecting that parameter to be an array, you could do result_object = a || [];
[05:16:38] <MikeD_> but imo that's a dodgier hack
[05:16:53] <Cork> MikeD_: it isn't really a hack
[05:17:00] <lejocelyn> ok, thanks
[05:17:04] <MikeD_> because if a is ever a falsey value (literally false or a 0) you get the [];
[05:17:05] <sacho> using javascript == hack
[05:17:05] <Cork> but ya, it depends on falsy so...
[05:17:12] <Cork> sacho: heh, ouch
[05:17:22] <sacho> MikeD_, if you expect an array, you aren't expecting false
[05:17:29] <MikeD_> right
[05:17:47] <Cork> lejocelyn: you could use arguments too if you want to
[05:18:19] <sacho> Cork, well, ternarys are a hack, the or operator is a hack..apparently
[05:18:23] <MikeD_> i prefer the options object being merged with defaults
[05:18:39] <Cork> sacho: not really
[05:18:46] <MikeD_> but that's a lot of overhead for a single parameter
[05:18:52] <Cork> its a perfectly normal documentated behavior of the language
[05:18:52] <sacho> that's what was said here =)
[05:19:23] <Cork> || returns the right part if the left part is falsy
[05:19:32] <sacho> I'm aware, I was making a joke.
[05:19:33] <sacho> please...
[05:20:53] <Cork> man every time i talk about es6 i wish browsers could hurry up and implement it
[05:21:04] <Cork> there is to many annoying things made nice in it...
[05:21:30] <Cork> one really gets spoiled when developing browser extensions :)
[05:21:31] <abailarri> Anyone know hot to make a script execute cyclicle? http://jsfiddle.net/0cmjnneL/ Execute this two lines
[05:21:55] <sacho> why don't you use 6to5 or traceur?
[05:22:20] <Cork> abailarri: you would have to use the callback from fadeOut (last first line)
[05:22:30] <Cork> else nothing prevents the second one from running instantly
[05:22:56] <abailarri> Cork, the second runs after 5 seconds
[05:23:11] <Cork> sacho: cause basically only one browser supports es6
[05:23:17] <Cork> so it is kinda silly to use it
[05:23:25] <sacho> uhh
[05:23:26] <MikeD_> abailarri: what are you trying to do?
[05:23:29] <abailarri> I mean, I want to appear/desappear the two images everytim
[05:23:30] <sacho> both of those convert es6 code to es5
[05:23:39] <abailarri> everyime*
[05:23:53] <Cork> yes, and i don't like having code inbetween what i push and write
[05:23:57] <Cork> adding extra error sources
[05:24:14] <Cork> abailarri: every time what?
[05:24:30] <Cork> constantly? or what?
[05:24:35] <MikeD_> abailarri: that fiddle doesn't really give enough explanation and it doesn't run (even incorrectly)
[05:24:35] <abailarri> yes constantly
[05:24:59] <Cork> abailarri: http://jsfiddle.net/0cmjnneL/1/
[05:25:19] <Cork> abailarri: though i strongly recommend using the callback from fadeOut for the fadeIn on second line
[05:25:37] <Cork> timers isn't reliable to do what you're doing there
[05:26:04] <Cork> abailarri: http://jsfiddle.net/0cmjnneL/2/
[05:27:39] <sacho> abailarri, that animation isn't really repeatable
[05:27:41] <abailarri> Cork, but in this script it no executes cyclically.
[05:27:49] <abailarri> This is that I want to do
[05:27:55] <Cork> abailarri: it does
[05:28:07] <Cork> next calls the function it animates the first element
[05:28:11] <Cork> and then the second element
[05:28:14] <Cork> that calls next again
[05:28:15] <sacho> abailarri, you never fade picTwo out
[05:30:38] <sacho> abailarri, similar to cork's solution - http://jsfiddle.net/aq0cp2cb/
[05:31:25] <Cork> sacho: why have the extra repeat function?
[05:31:53] <Mark_2> does anybody know why using both onclick and a href doesn’t work? <a href="{getUrl('document_srl',$document->document_srl, 'listStyle', $listStyle, 'cpage','')}" target="contents" onclick="jQuery('.contents').addClass('slideIn')">{$document->getTitle()}</a>
[05:32:01] <MikeD_> sacho: is it a feature of animations or of jquery in general that you can just end the chain with .promise() ?
[05:32:10] <Mark_2> i mean, how do i get both working?
[05:32:26] <MikeD_> Mark_2: "my eyes!"
[05:32:30] <Mark_2> sorry.
[05:32:42] <Mark_2> how do i use both onclick and a href?
[05:32:43] <Cork> MikeD_: its part of jquery
[05:33:05] <Cork> Mark_2: you shouldn't use event attributes, you should use event handlers instead
[05:33:16] <Cork> event attributes is a legacy solution from dom0
[05:33:28] <Cork> and it has a ton of breaking differences from event handlers
[05:33:31] <MikeD_> .. and a Bad Idea
[05:33:34] <Mark_2> hmm
[05:33:46] <Mark_2> you mean i should not use onclick?
[05:33:50] <Cork> yes
[05:33:58] <Mark_2> in stead use jQuery('button').click(function() {
[05:33:59] <Mark_2>     jQuery('.list').addClass('slideIn');
[05:33:59] <Mark_2> })
[05:34:00] <Mark_2> ?
[05:34:15] <Mark_2> i don’t see much difference though.
[05:34:17] <Cork> or $(document).on('click', 'button', func)
[05:34:25] <MikeD_> and get that craziness out of the href too
[05:34:45] <Cork> Mark_2: one has scope, separates code from markup, supports multiple handlers
[05:34:47] <Cork> and so on
[05:34:57] <Cork> that other (event attributes) doesn't
[05:35:11] <sacho> MikeD_, $(elements).promise() returns a promise that is resolved when all animations are completed
[05:35:18] <sacho> for those elements
[05:35:31] <Cork> sacho: its a bit more then that
[05:35:35] <sacho> it's a bit more complicated than that
[05:35:36] <abailarri> sacho, is posible th mix the two images instead of dessapear one and appear the other?
[05:35:48] <phpcoder> hello
[05:35:48] <sacho> abailarri, that's a question of your animation...
[05:35:54] <Cork> it's when the last step in the ani queue is executed
[05:35:57] <MikeD_> that's convenient - i've just started using promise() but it's been with manually created and resolved Deferred
[05:36:01] <phpcoder> can i intercept a "redirect" from a  $.post call ?
[05:36:12] <Cork> phpcoder: not in js no
[05:36:19] <phpcoder> i mean...i do this post if post goes well i have to redirect the user to another page
[05:36:44] <Cork> phpcoder: the server would have to send back a new url and you would have to load it from js
[05:36:48] <abailarri> sacho, now until the fadeout has not completed, the second image not appears. Is posible to appear during the fadeout?
[05:36:57] <Cork> phpcoder: ajax can't reload the page
[05:37:05] <phpcoder> ok
[05:37:06] <Cork> or rather, can't redirect the page
[05:37:54] <MikeD_> ajax can report the 301/302 status and you can respond as appropriate though, yeah?
[05:37:55] <Cork> abailarri: that is where things get complicated, you can do it with delay if you don't wait for the complete callback
[05:38:11] <Cork> abailarri: but timers isn't guaranteed to execute exactly to the time you've given
[05:38:27] <Cork> so you have a quite high risk of getting things out of sync
[05:38:42] <Cork> MikeD_: 3xx isn't forwarded to js
[05:38:52] <Cork> the browser consumes those responses internaly
[05:38:57] <MikeD_> oh
[05:39:09] <Cork> and the resulting page is given to the site if the browser allows it (not cors)
[05:39:33] <MikeD_> i guess I'm glad I never had to deal with that :)
[05:39:39] <Cork> i have :)
[05:40:01] <abailarri> Cork, then whats is the best solution for have 8 images that change every X seconds in multiple parts of the page?
[05:40:04] <Cork> trying to make a js app that consumes a restful api is a bit annoying cause of this
[05:40:24] <Cork> abailarri: honestly i would use css3
[05:40:43] <Cork> transition gives exactly this guarantee
[05:40:44] <MikeD_> isn't a redirect in response to a post some kind of violation of trust/obviousness anyway?
[05:40:58] <Cork> MikeD_: post is always redirected to a get call
[05:40:59] <sacho> no
[05:41:00] <Cork> so no
[05:41:23] <sacho> and generally, if you moved a resource elsewhere, you'd respond with a redirect regardless of get/post
[05:41:26] <Cork> and all the paramteres is dropped
[05:42:11] <Cork> MikeD_: a redirect  as a response to a post is extremely common on the web btw
[05:42:15] <MikeD_> so a form handled via post ... should or should not be given a "content moved" redirect?
[05:42:22] <Cork> basically every forum/bugtracker out there does it
[05:42:31] <Cork> to prevent double posting from just a reload of the post call
[05:42:55] <Cork> (as it would be a get call to the resulting page)
[05:42:57] <MikeD_> oh..
[05:43:52] <MikeD_> i don't miss integrating our scumware with 3rd party 'affiliate' scumware :)
[05:44:04] <phpcoder> Cork, done
[05:44:08] <phpcoder> i just reply with an "ok"
[05:44:11] <phpcoder> and then i do location.reload();
[05:44:41] <phpcoder> the problem is that when i reload the browser goes down
[05:44:42] <Cork> MikeD_: out, ya been there
[05:44:48] <phpcoder> i think i have to create something like #top
[05:45:09] <Cork> phpcoder: #top is supported in browser without creating anything
[05:45:16] <Cork> :)
[05:45:31] <Cork> surprised first time i found that out
[05:45:40] <phpcoder> Cork, oh really?? :D
[05:45:42] <phpcoder> good!
[05:45:47] <phpcoder> the problem here that i use location.reload()
[05:45:57] <phpcoder> how can i say....reload the page with #top
[05:45:58] <phpcoder> ?
[05:46:47] <MikeD_> are you saying #top is the effect of loading a # reference that isn't found so it just goes to 0,0 on the page?
[05:47:28] <MikeD_> though if you id an element "top" in your footer, you'd get the bizarre result from iding your footer element "top" ?
[05:49:23] <Cork> phpcoder: location.uh...
[05:49:32] <Cork> jsfiddle is going nuts for me....
[05:50:04] <Cork> O_o'
[05:50:08] <Cork> can't save
[05:50:24] <phpcoder> hmm
[05:51:10] <Cork> anyway try window.location = window.location.pathname + '#top';
[05:51:11] <phpcoder> Cork, window.location.href = "http://www.example.com";
[05:51:11] <phpcoder> ?
[05:51:19] <phpcoder> ok
[05:51:39] <Cork> weird, can only create empty fiddles O_o
[05:51:55] <Cork> if i add any content it only redirects to jsfiddle.net/
[05:52:07] <MikeD_> "clear cookies"
[05:52:19] <MikeD_> because that's the solution to every problem browsers ever have
[05:52:36] <Cork> MikeD_: tried on several different profiles
[05:52:55] <Cork> and one of them is clean as a whistle
[05:53:30] <gtristan> MikeD_, killall -9 firefox and restart also helps me when it's taking 99% cpu ;-)
[05:53:33] <MikeD_> i didn't think it would work... i'm just giving the general wisdom for solving browser problems... it's the internet version of "turn it off and back on again"
[05:53:48] <Cork> heh
[05:54:03] <Cork> MikeD_: the browsers safe mode is my number one recommendation
[05:54:12] <Cork> far before checking for cookies
[05:55:21] <MikeD_> I wish internet nerds had never named them 'cookies' much less shared the term with average users
[05:55:49] <Cork> MikeD_: it wasn't nerds calling it that though
[05:56:09] <MikeD_> they had a real name once?
[05:56:18] <Cork> that is the real name
[05:56:31] <Cork> the header is Set-Cookie: <string>
[05:56:33] <phpcoder> Cork,
[05:56:36] <phpcoder> problem
[05:56:43] <phpcoder> window.location = window.location.pathname + '#top';
[05:56:50] <phpcoder> this works but it does not reload the page
[05:56:55] <phpcoder> it put the page on top
[05:56:58] <Cork> ah, damn ya
[05:57:02] <phpcoder> i need to reload it
[05:57:11] <phpcoder> maybe as i wrote before?
[05:57:16] <phpcoder> window.location.href ?
[05:57:24] <Cork> you have to scroll the page to the top before reloading
[05:57:50] <Cork> is it scrollX for window... i never remember
[05:58:21] <Cork> opps i meant scrollU
[05:58:22] <MikeD_> is it really this difficult to do what you're doing?
[05:58:23] <Cork> *Y
[05:58:39] <Cork> phpcoder: try window.scrollY = 0; window.location.reload()
[05:58:47] <phpcoder> ok
[05:59:12] <Xatenev> x u y
[05:59:13] <Xatenev> :o
[05:59:20] <phpcoder> Cork, i fixed it doing window.location.href = window.location.pathname;
[05:59:26] <phpcoder> it call the page
[05:59:31] <phpcoder> withod reload()
[05:59:40] <phpcoder> reload remember the position on the window
[05:59:42] <Cork> and it resets the scroll position?
[05:59:45] <phpcoder> in this case i call the page as a link
[05:59:48] <phpcoder> yes
[05:59:49] <phpcoder> it resets it
[05:59:59] <Cork> ah, when you say it i get a vague memory of that
[06:00:21] <MikeD_> does that work properly in the browsers you care about?
[06:00:38] <Cork> MikeD_: you mean setting the url instead of .reload?
[06:00:51] <Cork> i think that is expected behavior actually
[06:00:55] <Cork> i just forgot :)
[06:01:12] <morfin> hello
[06:01:39] <morfin> does element.data("something",somevalue) saves reference?
[06:01:45] <MikeD_> kk, just a reminder to make sure you don't have "it worked in my browser" and then you demo for the boss who uses not-your browser and it's differently-abled  :)
[06:02:19] <Cork> morfin: data is a wrapper around a normal object with "something" as a key
[06:02:28] <Cork> so everything you can store as a value is stored
[06:02:44] <Cork> including references to dom elements or functions
[06:03:04] <cjohnson> not to be confused with .attr('data-something', somereference)
[06:03:10] <Cork> yes
[06:03:14] <t4nk753> Hello - I have a image set and when it is been clicked on it does value = value+1. Now when the user is clicking multiple times on it, certain elements get selected because the browser detects it as "double-click".. Any way to prevent this properly ? :(
[06:03:17] <Cork> the later one only supports strings
[06:04:04] <Cork> t4nk753: css user-select: none
[06:04:12] <Cork> ?mdn user-select
[06:04:12] <b-ot> Cork: user-select - CSS | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/user-select
[06:04:30] <Cork> doesn't work in older ie though
[06:04:30] <t4nk753> lets see
[06:10:37] <Mark_2> for some reason, the 2nd button on this page doesn’t work anybody know why? http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/page_FIsv96
[06:12:25] <Cork> Mark_2: at least say where the code is
[06:13:54] <Mark_2> jQuery('.open_list').click(function() {
[06:13:55] <Mark_2>     jQuery('.list').addClass('slideIn');
[06:13:56] <Mark_2> })
[06:13:58] <Mark_2> jQuery('.open_contents').click(function() {
[06:13:59] <Mark_2>     jQuery('.board_contents').addClass('slideIn');
[06:14:01] <Mark_2> })
[06:14:02] <Mark_2> jQuery('.close_list').click(function() {
[06:14:03] <Mark_2>     jQuery('.list').removeClass('slideIn');
[06:14:04] <Mark_2> })
[06:14:05] <Mark_2> sorry for the spam.
[06:14:12] <stompdar1ach> jsfiddle.net
[06:14:42] <Cork> Mark_2: basically never post more then one or max two liners in the channel
[06:14:53] <Cork> everything else should go in a pb of some sort
[06:15:07] <Mark_2> sorry!
[06:15:15] <Cork> and i asked for the location
[06:15:17] <Cork> not the code
[06:15:34] <Mark_2> it’s in the dfault.layout.css
[06:15:42] <Cork> .css??
[06:15:50] <stompdar1ach> :-)
[06:16:15] <Cork> iii kinda think i know where the problem is in that case...
[06:16:20] <Mark_2> oops
[06:16:24] <Mark_2> sorry!
[06:16:37] <Mark_2> defualt.layout.js
[06:16:43] <Mark_2> *default
[06:18:56] <Cork> Mark_2: you have opacity set on the element
[06:19:02] <Mark_2> yeah
[06:19:08] <Mark_2> even if i give opacity:1
[06:19:11] <Cork> so when it slides in it doesn't get visible
[06:19:17] <Mark_2> the contents ar emissing.
[06:19:38] <Mark_2> i think there’s a something that causes the problem, don’t kow why.
[06:19:56] <Cork> well the iframe gets height: 0px
[06:20:01] <Cork> so ya you don't see that
[06:20:15] <Mark_2> hmm sec.
[06:20:24] <Cork> (cause the board_contents has height: 0)
[06:20:38] <Cork> ah there is the problem
[06:20:40] <Mark_2> omg.
[06:20:57] <Cork> you can't set height: 100% on an element with a parent that has dynamic height
[06:21:18] <Mark_2> i see.
[06:21:34] <Cork> cause 100% 0f unknown (auto) == 0px
[06:21:47] <Mark_2> im confused
[06:22:07] <Mark_2> the other layer (list) works when i give it height 0
[06:22:17] <Mark_2> and addclass height 100%
[06:23:41] <Cork> Mark_2: heh css order
[06:23:54] <Cork> .slideIn { height: 100%; opacity: 1; } .board_contents { ... height: 0; }
[06:24:04] <Cork> .board_contents will win over slideIn
[06:24:12] <Cork> but .list is before .slideIn so it loses
[06:24:28] <Cork> just move slideIn down one group and it should work
[06:26:10] <Mark_2> thanks so much cork
[06:26:56] <Cork> np
[06:34:03] <morfin> how do i remove elements from current element to element with specified id?
[06:34:28] <Cork> morfin: are they siblings?
[06:34:31] <morfin> yep
[06:34:41] <Cork> nextUntil('#id').remove()
[06:34:46] <morfin> :O
[06:35:02] <Cork> on $(this) that is
[06:37:30] <stompdar1ach> Cork: are you paul irish
[06:37:33] <morfin> lol did not know)
[06:43:06] <wheeei^^> Cork I did it! =) finally done... do you have any idea on how I can send over my work thats been editing a live site, (they pointed out that I had to use the console in the browser)
[06:47:01] <Cork> wheeei^^: uh store the js you've written in a .js file and send that i guess
[06:47:20] <Cork> sounds kinda silly to construct the test that way... but what ever
[06:49:26] <wheeei^^> Cork totally agree but I dont think its just the test, I think thats actually how I will work if I get the job... The whole page I was editing was generated through JS nothing was in the html except the menu to other pages. they put on and off scripts and testing what generates the most customers
[06:49:47] <Cork> O_o
[06:50:14] <Cork> wheeei^^: i would seriously recommend you to look into firefox scratchpad if that is the case
[06:50:14] <wheeei^^> If I turn off JS the page is blank :P
[06:50:30] <Cork> but only web console access...
[06:50:45] <Cork> the idea of having that work criteria makes me want to cry
[06:51:12] <wheeei^^> Cork naah I think I have more access when actually implementing the changes but I think they test changes that way
[06:51:26] <Cork> still...
[06:52:02] <Cork> sounds like a lazy way out of having to set up a real test environment
[07:10:47] <MikeD_> is it generally advised to write functions to accept callbacks (success, fail) or return a promise and let the calling code use .done() and .fail() ?
[07:14:09] <Cork> MikeD_: not really
[07:14:11] <Cork> both work
[07:14:21] <sacho_> MikeD_, both are inferior to .then()
[07:14:43] <Cork> i personally like to use promise as it lets you structure the code better
[07:14:52] <Cork> sacho_: that seriously depend on what you need
[07:15:11] <Cork> as then chain the return value, it can be very wrong for some cases
[07:15:31] <sacho_> like..?
[07:16:24] <MikeD_> how is .then() "superior" to .done() and fail() ?
[07:16:27] <Cork> if you are to return the value from an api, and if one of the subscribers can remove the data by accident
[07:16:34] <Cork> MikeD_: it isn't
[07:16:42] <Cork> its a different way to do basically the same thing
[07:16:45] <sacho_> Cork, that doesn't make sense, can you give an actual example?
[07:16:53] <MikeD_> k, that's what I though
[07:16:55] <MikeD_> t
[07:16:58] <sacho_> MikeD_, .done() and .fail() are just a different syntax to success: error: callbacks.
[07:17:06] <sacho_> .then() actually returns a new promise.
[07:17:07] <Cork> sacho_: a().then(function() { return b; })
[07:17:28] <sacho_> Cork, yes? what about it? that's intended usage.
[07:17:47] <Cork> sacho_: if what you want is to provide access to the data from something
[07:17:56] <Cork> and every caller has to make sure not to kill that data
[07:18:03] <sacho_> ....
[07:18:07] <sacho_> you're massively confused
[07:18:15] <Cork> uh, no
[07:18:16] <sacho_> if you want to provide "access to the data from something" return a()
[07:18:23] <sacho_> there's no "killing the data".
[07:19:13] <sacho_> a().then() returns a new promise - it doesn't modify a()'s value at all
[07:19:15] <sacho_> that was fixed in 1.8
[07:19:38] <Mark_2> will anybody take a look at this page and tell me why the jquey function isn’t working? http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/page_FIsv96
[07:20:21] <lejocelyn> there's not lenght attribute for object
[07:20:32] <lejocelyn> how to know that is it is empty ?
[07:20:46] <Cork> lejocelyn: Object.keys(obj).length
[07:21:04] <lejocelyn> ok :)
[07:21:06] <lejocelyn> thanks
[07:21:11] <Mark_2> will anybody take a look at this page and tell me why the jquey function isn’t working? http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/page_FIsv96
[07:21:12] <Mark_2> if you click the first ‘click me’ button, a board pops up, and there’s a thread that’s titled ‘1’ , and if you click it, popup’s supposed to  be oppened but it’s not
[07:21:14] <Mark_2> sorry for the spam
[07:25:53] <baako> hi guys i dont know if any of you have used phonegap bar code scanner plugin before but i have been trying to get it working and I have try different solutions. https://github.com/cfjedimaster/Cordova-Examples/tree/master/barcode/www
[07:26:47] <MikeD_> i know it's bad form, but code were to use window.location to reload the page with unresolved promises - does it cause any problem?
[07:29:46] <abailarri> Anyone know any plugin for make this effect with the images? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENBqE8Ruhtk
[07:30:00] <sacho_> MikeD_, those promises would cease to exist
[07:30:14] <sacho_> (and any code waiting on them)
[07:30:24] <BillCriswell> abailarri: carousels with different timeouts.
[07:30:43] <abailarri> BillCriswell, what plugin?
[07:30:46] <MikeD_> thanks for confirming that it's just a horrible design and not a potential memory leak or somesuch
[07:31:06] <BillCriswell> Any of the billion google returns when you google "js slideshow"
[07:32:00] <asm0deus> MikeD_: no memory leaks just broken promises :~(
[07:32:07] <MikeD_> haha
[07:32:15] <MikeD_> because it's funny:  http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[07:37:20] <asm0deus> MikeD_: haha by that logic isnt tabbed content "bad" then too, not sure I agree with them but whatevs, its clickbait
[07:39:21] <cjohnson> tabs as a form of a navigation makes sense...to visually organize hierarchy
[07:39:47] <cjohnson> splitting a page into a bunch of clicks that generally breaks your normal browser functions for reading through content isn't the same
[07:41:20] <BillCriswell> I don't think people are looking at a page long enough to even notice if a slideshow exists most the time.
[07:41:41] <BillCriswell> Slideshows are just a way to trick management into thinking all the messages they want are at the top of the page.
[07:42:00] <Mark_2> is there anyway a div layer that’s put inside the iframe can go outside of the iframe ?
[07:43:00] <sacho_> visually? might be possible
[07:44:32] <rzeka> I am scrolling page using jquery. How can I detect that user scrolls it himself during animation and stop it? When I use $(window).scroll(function() { $('html,body').stop(true); }) it stops the animation too
[07:45:28] <amore123> I making an ajax request to add some products in a list of products. Then I go to www.whatever.com and then press Go Back to show the list of products. My problem: the added products using the ajax request are not any more there.. So to show them after going back? Should I make an ajax request obligatory, or could restore I them in some way since they were already shown in the client. In other words, they already are in the us
[07:45:28] <amore123> er's computer.
[07:45:49] <amore123> So how*
[07:46:31] <BillCriswell> rzeka: You want to stop the user from scrolling the page naturally?
[07:47:16] <rzeka> no. I've got onepager and when user clicks on menu item, page scrolls to content. But now during animation, when he tries to scroll, I want to stop the animation
[07:47:42] <BillCriswell> rzeka: Oh, phew.
[07:48:14] <BillCriswell> Let me try this out, sounds fun.
[07:48:25] <rzeka> :D
[07:50:53] <BillCriswell> rzeka: Actually came across this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8858994/let-user-scrolling-stop-jquery-animation-of-scrolltop
[07:51:48] <rzeka> "scroll mousedown DOMMouseScroll mousewheel keyup" nice monster :)
[07:51:53] <morfin> hmmm
[07:52:13] <Es0teric> alright so i have this problem — http://jsfiddle.net/Le7punhw/ i want to remove any <p> tags that dont have text or html in them
[07:52:18] <BillCriswell> Actually, I want to try this in another way. Need to snoop the event object.
[07:52:20] <rzeka> BillCriswell: thanks. I thought I'll ask on irc before goole, maybe someone did that already
[07:52:22] <Es0teric> this currently removes all images that have <strong> tags in them as well
[07:52:34] <rzeka> Ah, so more fun then
[07:52:52] <morfin> length === 0 is incorrect
[07:53:20] <morfin> because you can have only newline as example i think
[07:53:23] <morfin> or just space hmm
[07:53:42] <Es0teric> morfin yeah
[07:54:11] <squeakytoy> hey all. Isnt there a shortcut for $.Deferred().reject()?
[07:54:12] <Es0teric> morfin: so i tried doing something like html().length == 6 (so it can look for &nbsp;) and still nothing
[07:59:59] <_DB> hey guys
[08:00:03] <_DB> http://laravel.io/bin/l5Y98
[08:00:08] <_DB> I have  script that sends that to my hidden input
[08:00:11] <_DB> I want to turn it into json data
[08:00:22] <_DB> its currently a string in json form
[08:01:08] <MikeD_> JSON.parse() ?
[08:01:29] <arthurvr> `api jQuery.parseJSON @ _DB
[08:01:29] <b-ot> _DB: jQuery.parseJSON: Takes a well-formed JSON string and returns the resulting JavaScript object. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.parseJSON/
[08:04:13] <BillCriswell> _DB: Is it in a data attrbute? If you were to do like <input data-json="..."> you can get an object with $('input').data('json')
[08:04:50] <_DB> ahh alright
[08:04:56] <_DB> it was just the input not a attribute
[08:05:15] <BillCriswell> rzeka: Eh I'd just go with the stackoverflow answer haha
[08:05:26] <rzeka> haha :D nice
[08:11:04] <Es0teric> alright so i have this problem — http://jsfiddle.net/Le7punhw/ i want to remove any <p> tags that dont have text or html in them this currently removes all images that have <strong> tags in them as well
[08:12:39] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: $('p:empty').remove()
[08:12:48] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: really?
[08:13:15] <Es0teric> inside of the filter?
[08:13:19] <baako> this is a weird one but a var name like this var qr-code; note the "-" is acceptable in a variable name in jquery? the result why i ask is because sublime is marking it in a different colour
[08:13:42] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: inside of the filter $(this).empty() would work too right?
[08:14:11] <BillCriswell> .empty() empties out the element, remove removes the whole element.
[08:14:35] <BillCriswell> so .empty() is like doing <div>Hi</div> -> <div></div>, .remove() is like doing <div>Hi</div> ->
[08:15:10] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: ohh
[08:16:00] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: so then how would i check if a p is empty inside the filter?
[08:16:21] <Es0teric> or would the one you told me apply to all p tags?
[08:17:01] <asm0deus> es0teric: var x = $('p').text(); if (x=='') { $('p').text('sup'); }
[08:17:03] <decx> baako: it's not
[08:17:05] <BillCriswell> You can do $('.single-article p:empty').css('border', '1px solid red'); to see what's selected.
[08:17:37] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Your finlter is only looking for text, it's not looking for html nodes.
[08:17:50] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: yes so i figured that much lol
[08:18:04] <BillCriswell> but :empty shoudl cover your things.
[08:19:29] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: nothing is selected with the css
[08:19:52] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/Le7punhw/2/
[08:20:36] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: it looks like <p> tags have &nbsp; in them
[08:21:13] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: so now my p tags look like this http://jsfiddle.net/Le7punhw/3/
[08:21:14] <BillCriswell> If the p tags had that in them they'd have height.
[08:21:41] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: They're not empty anymore.
[08:22:08] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: right.. so i want to now check if they are empty, have &nbsp; and have html.. if there is no content then remove it
[08:22:41] <BillCriswell> &nbsp; is content.
[08:23:02] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: yes i understand that but i want it to check for that and no content then remove
[08:26:16] <vegard1992> hello Cork
[08:26:29] <vegard1992> i was told all my questions would be answered by you
[08:27:08] <Omar-> ?ask @ vegard1992
[08:27:08] <b-ot> vegard1992: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[08:27:38] <Es0teric> hey BillCriswell what could be a possible resolution?
[08:27:40] <asm0deus> Es0teric: $('p').each(function() { var ct = $(this).children().length; var x = this.val(); if ((ct > 0)&&(x.indexOf('&nbsp') > -1) { $(this).remove(); } });
[08:27:41] <vegard1992> lol :D
[08:28:16] <Es0teric> asm0deus: will that also check for html inside p ?
[08:28:37] <asm0deus> Es0teric: ct is the number of child nodes in p http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4291151/jquery-count-child-elements
[08:29:13] <Es0teric> can’t i just do that same thing with filter?
[08:29:17] <Es0teric> and return the matches?
[08:29:19] <Mark_2> how do i Invoke jquery code in theparent page from the iframe?
[08:29:48] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/page_FIsv96 i want to open the layer i the parent page from an iframe
[08:29:54] <asm0deus> Es0teric: not sure i dont use filter much
[08:29:56] <Mark_2> *in
[08:31:15] <ciqsteve> Q: jqueryui - Is it possible to 'drag' a div that lives in a fixed div and drop it into a relative div?  I can't seem to get it to work
[08:33:31] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: http://jsfiddle.net/Le7punhw/6/ seems to work.
[08:35:08] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: so anything with a red border would be removed
[08:35:09] <Es0teric> right?
[08:35:23] <BillCriswell> Yeah, that's what's selected.
[08:35:45] <Es0teric> ok well some images will still be removed
[08:35:59] <BillCriswell> Yeah just noticed that.
[08:37:25] <Mark_2> is it possible to control a div layer that’s in the parent page from an iframe?
[08:38:06] <MagmaRules> Hello there, anyone knows if there is a feature in jquery that sets z-index to negative values in ie on hide/show? I have this wierd behaviour on ie8 on a specific machine where divs are showing up with negative z-index that i did not set
[08:38:19] <morfin> i know .data stores somewhere in jQuery internals
[08:42:43] <abailarri> BillCriswell, I tried with a lot of plugins and not results
[08:43:21] <abailarri> Is no a simple slider, for each image there are a slide and special order of movement
[08:46:06] <robertmaxrees> wooooo!
[08:47:27] <BillCriswell> abailarri: Call 5 different instances of the plugin with 5 different effects.
[08:47:30] <arthurvr> hey-hey, robertmaxrees
[08:47:39] <robertmaxrees> how's it going arthurvr?
[08:47:57] <BillCriswell> $('.box-one').slideshow({ animation: 'fade' }); $('.box-two').slideshow({ animation: 'slideLeft' });  etc etc
[08:47:58] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: everything going well :)
[08:48:06] <arthurvr> robertmaxrees: how’s your day?
[08:48:18] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: -> http://jsfiddle.net/Le7punhw/7/
[08:48:20] <Es0teric> got it
[08:48:29] <robertmaxrees> fantastic so far.  just rolled into work, doing my morning blog/email runthrough.
[08:49:40] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: Sweet.
[08:49:55] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: thanks for helping me with the previous revision of that
[08:50:01] <Es0teric> helped me figure out the missing piece lol
[08:50:03] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[08:50:07] <robertmaxrees> BillCriswell++
[08:50:26] <BillCriswell> ++ me
[08:50:52] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: the one asm0deus did was good but it wasnt as clean
[08:52:26] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: The whole situation sucks in general.
[08:52:42] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: yeah.. but its a wordpress site
[08:52:46] <Es0teric> code is horrible all around
[08:52:53] <BillCriswell> Eh.
[08:53:08] <Es0teric> i personally prefer mvc frameworks like laravel or lithium
[08:53:09] <BillCriswell> I just get cranky when I have to use a hacky solution in general.
[08:53:14] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:53:25] <Es0teric> yeah
[08:53:30] <robertmaxrees> the codebase might suck, but your code doesn't need to compound the problem.
[08:57:33] <BillCriswell> Es0teric: More along the lines of what asm0deus suggested. I'd probably use this: http://jsfiddle.net/Le7punhw/8/
[08:58:16] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: damn.. i just pushed the previous solution to the dev server
[08:58:17] <Es0teric> lol
[08:59:50] <BillCriswell> I was overcomplicating that pretty bad.
[09:00:01] <BillCriswell> Hindsight is 20/20
[09:00:28] <Velveeta> some peoples' highsight isn't even that good
[09:00:36] <islalobo> Hello, I'm trying use document.on to ensure that when all four options are clicked that the final option - 'options-5' - gets automagically selected: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/a3bbd27e44751f964954
[09:01:04] <Es0teric> BillCriswell: alright yeah that does look a lot better.. i was able to apply that revision.. thanks again man
[09:01:12] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:01:45] <BillCriswell> I totally spaced on .html() returning the html elements is the string it returns for whatever reason.
[09:04:13] <BillCriswell> islalobo: So you have a list of checkboxes, and when they're all selected you want a "select all" to be checked?
[09:05:35] <islalobo> BillCriswell: yep
[09:05:52] <islalobo> But I just got it!
[09:06:04] <islalobo> I had the wrong selector targeted…
[09:06:38] <BillCriswell> islalobo: Ah ok. I can show you how to do this a little more easily so when you add options you won't have to adjust the code.
[09:07:37] <islalobo> Sure, I'm also realizing I will have an issue if a user clicks all the options and then chooses to 'unclick' one - the ''all" options stays checked
[09:07:48] <BillCriswell> Ok cool.
[09:08:26] <BillCriswell> First, do all theme checkboxes have a simliar class? The ones that start with edit-submitted-popup-email-preferences ?
[09:09:04] <islalobo> BillCriswell: This is what I ended with, but if you have a cleaner way I'm interested! They don't…I've done it before when they do. But in those cases I created the form and and I added a class to the options I wanted to be in a certain class='group'
[09:09:25] <islalobo> This is with drupal webforms and I don't know how to add a class to the different options. They are all part of the same select list
[09:10:35] <Mark_2> is this right? onclick="jQuery{parent.myPublicFunction()};
[09:10:36] <Mark_2> ">
[09:10:46] <Mark_2> onclick="jQuery{parent.myPublicFunction()};">
[09:10:55] <BillCriswell> islalobo: Select List?
[09:11:01] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 nope.
[09:11:05] <robertmaxrees> don't use inline JS.
[09:11:10] <islalobo> BillCriswell: Yeah, a select list
[09:11:22] <Mark_2> um, how do i put it right?
[09:11:36] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 use .on() from within your JS instead.
[09:12:07] <islalobo> BillCriswell: If I pretend that the options won't change in the future. How would I ensure the other issue I mentioned won't happen? Like, if first the user checks each option and then they uncheck one…how can I make sure that the 'all' option is check/uncheck appropriately
[09:12:20] <islalobo> I know how to check, I can't think of how to uncheck
[09:13:01] <asm0deus> islalobo: run the same function onclick for all of the checkboxes, then get the states of all of them, if all checked, then check 5th, if any one is unchecked uncheck fix
[09:13:09] <asm0deus> *fix = fifth
[09:14:07] <BillCriswell> islalobo: I was going to do like $checkboxes = $('.checkboxes'), then whenever one of them change I do $('.select-all-checkboxes').prop('checked', $checkboxes.length === $checkboxes.filter(':checked').length);
[09:14:31] <Mark_2> does anybody know how to call a div layer that’s in the parent page, from an iframe? http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/page_FIsv96
[09:14:38] <Mark_2> anybody?
[09:15:46] <BillCriswell> islalobo: Here's something I did for an interview a while back that should help: http://jsbin.com/okijaj/3/edit?html,js,output
[09:18:16] <oddvar> Mark_2,  parent.getElementById('foo'); ?
[09:18:38] <Mark_2> oddvar: im a newbie, could you clarify how i can use it in code?
[09:18:48] <robertmaxrees> Mark_2 assuming no CORS problems, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.parent
[09:19:27] <Mark_2> um, i don’t know how to use it robertmaxrees.
[09:19:30] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18372746/targeting-the-parent-window-using-jquery
[09:19:33] <robertmaxrees> this has some examples.
[09:21:33] <islalobo> BillCriswell:  I like your example. Using classes is a much better idea, but without classes I tried something like this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/19bd9567a969e3fe59cd …it seems to work for the time being.
[09:21:43] <islalobo> asm0deus: thank you for the tip!
[09:22:22] <BillCriswell> Ok cool.
[09:22:57] <Mark_2> how do i use $("#iframeOne", top.document); with  jQuery('.open_contents').click(function() {
[09:22:58] <Mark_2>     jQuery('.board_contents').addClass('slideIn');
[09:22:59] <Mark_2> })
[09:23:02] <Mark_2> ?
[09:23:11] <islalobo> BillCriswell++
[09:23:13] <Mark_2> im a newbie sorry. anyhelp would be very appreciated.
[09:23:14] <islalobo> For helping!
[09:23:15] <robertmaxrees> please don't multiline paste into the channel, Mark_2
[09:23:20] <Mark_2> sorry.
[09:23:22] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[09:23:24] <robertmaxrees> and what, exactly, do you need help with
[09:23:38] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean "use with"?
[09:24:13] <Mark_2> well, above is my codes for loading a board_contents layer
[09:24:34] <Mark_2> i just dont’ know how i can have it from my iframe.
[09:24:55] <Mark_2> $("#iframeOne", top.document);  alone doesn’t make any sense to me. :p
[09:24:57] <robertmaxrees> so when you click something in the iframe, you want something to happen in the parent window?
[09:25:02] <Mark_2> yesyes.
[09:25:28] <robertmaxrees> $("#iframeOne", top.document); is basically the same as $(top.document).find('#iframeOne'), which you've probably seen before.
[09:25:42] <robertmaxrees> basically, you need to tell jquery to start looking from another place, instead of the current document.
[09:25:55] <Mark_2> uh huh.
[09:26:01] <robertmaxrees> so you want something like  jQuery('.board_contents', top.document).addClass('slideIn');
[09:26:13] <robertmaxrees> that'll fine .board_contents inside the top.document.
[09:26:34] <robertmaxrees> *find, not fine
[09:27:00] <Mark_2> wait,
[09:27:14] <Mark_2> i have the codes above in my parent’s window.
[09:27:36] <robertmaxrees> then instead you need to change how you're bidning.
[09:28:10] <robertmaxrees> are the iframe and the parent page on the same domain?
[09:28:21] <Mark_2> oh nvm, it works1
[09:28:27] <robertmaxrees> okay
[09:28:32] <Mark_2> thanks !
[09:28:39] <Mark_2> you are most help.
[09:31:45] <skypce> hello all
[09:32:15] <skypce> how can i use media queries with jquery
[09:32:16] <skypce> ?
[09:32:22] <robertmaxrees> you... don't
[09:32:23] <robertmaxrees> ?
[09:32:35] <robertmaxrees> you can detect screen sizes and go from there instead.
[09:33:04] <asm0deus> skypce: http://www.fourfront.us/blog/jquery-window-width-and-media-queries
[09:33:24] <skypce> thank you :)

[10:27:46] <robertmaxrees> trollin' and lollin' folks
[10:35:11] <SpokY> Hello, maybe one can help me.. i use the slide with fixed range, but the rage from 2-32 maybe i can use this with text? example 2 Slots X next step then 4 Slots XY
[10:36:44] <robertmaxrees> try again?
[10:36:49] <robertmaxrees> that question is hard to follow.
[10:37:11] <notchris> Is this the wrong syntax for a conditional “has class”
[10:37:12] <notchris> if ($ocmenu.hasClass('')){
[10:37:28] <robertmaxrees> notchris that's the right syntax
[10:37:40] <notchris> robertmaxrees: Thank you, just learning conditionals
[10:37:48] <notchris> Trying to get it in my head
[10:37:52] <robertmaxrees> ah
[10:38:01] <robertmaxrees> all about return values and truthy/falsy :)
[10:38:31] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy
[10:39:47] <notchris> Thank you!
[10:47:22] <SpokY> I want to add costum text for each "step" ond the slider
[10:47:27] <SpokY> not the range 1-100
[10:47:50] <SpokY> Text: Slide postion 1 Text 1, Slide position 2 Text2
[10:47:53] <SpokY> I hope you understand me :D
[10:48:17] <SpokY> or maybe range 1 - 32 and for this a text with the "price"
[11:03:42] <brandonjjon> So I have a $('input:checkbox').on('click', function() { event that updates the total automatically.. however if the form validation fails for whatever reason and the page reloads, the checkboxes remain checked but the total is wrong. Is there a way I can re-trigger the click event or something? https://gist.github.com/brandonjjon/0b75a911fb66b84b8c4d
[11:04:07] <robertmaxrees> you can do a .trigger(), but I'd abstract out the function you're running and just call that instead.
[11:04:50] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: I'm a JS beginner, could you perhaps elaborate on the abstraction or provide a link to an example.
[11:10:50] <jimi_> I have some method on the backend that renders in 2 seconds if you go to http://domain/path/foo.php?blah=true   directly in the browser, but 10 seconds over ajax. Where would i start to debug that?
[11:12:26] <robertmaxrees> brandonjjon sure - could you share your code on a jsfiddle?
[11:13:11] <Zzaichik> git st
[11:13:16] <Zzaichik> hehe
[11:13:34] <Getty> i get CRAZY on this cross origin...... IE and Firefox deny todo it, but chrome is totally happy
[11:13:59] <Getty> i have now tried like all of the Allow headers in all full beauty, and still......... always the error, and not precise enough to show me WHY it denies to fetch it
[11:14:18] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: I tried to set up a JSfiddle but it was taking a while, hopefully this will suffice.. updated code with a reCheck function (https://gist.github.com/brandonjjon/946b25ac50e4ce21f3d7)
[11:14:36] <Getty> this is like right now my last hheader setup: https://gist.github.com/Getty/67082e453a5636d9b3d0
[11:20:56] <robertmaxrees> brandonjjon sorry was busy.  one sec.
[11:22:54] <robertmaxrees> i assume you want to ditch the reCheck method entirely, yeah?
[11:23:55] <robertmaxrees> because that would look like this: http://fixee.org/paste/kmm7c4w/
[11:24:15] <robertmaxrees> also - you should use .val(), not .attr('value')
[11:24:30] <robertmaxrees> and you've got a global variable that can lead to some headaches
[11:25:53] <robertmaxrees> this might fix some of these issues - http://fixee.org/paste/kmm7c4w/#url=s1wom95
[11:26:28] <Getty> AH HA! i got it
[11:26:35] <robertmaxrees> what was the issue?
[11:26:38] <robertmaxrees> bad data?
[11:26:47] <Getty> damn nginx, is doing different things on GET then on OPTIONS
[11:26:51] <robertmaxrees> hah
[11:26:55] <Getty> and OPTIONS is the one that counts, which of course i didnt tested proper
[11:26:59] <Getty> now i see that its not sending the header
[11:27:08] <Getty> i HAVE the add_header inside location / so i thought they would catch
[11:27:10] <Getty> but..... seems not ;)
[11:27:21] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[11:27:24] <Getty> actually the options return 200 is inside there........
[11:27:27] <Getty> i didnt fixed it yet
[11:27:51] <robertmaxrees> jimi_ look at your network panel and see if it's all network time.
[11:28:39] <Getty> yeah sure add_header is not allowed outside of location /
[11:28:42] <Getty> tada tada tada
[11:33:02] <jimi_> robertmaxrees, ah, its because i am calling .abort() on previous keyup searches, but they are still being sent to server
[11:33:11] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[11:34:10] <jimi_> robertmaxrees, well that sucks. I am calling .abort() on previous ... any suggestions? i guess i could wait until some time elapsed and then send the request?
[11:34:23] <robertmaxrees> you sure you're calling it correctly?
[11:34:34] <Getty> ok now that doesnt make any sense... when i do return 200; then those headers are not added, btu when i do return 204; they are added
[11:34:37] <Getty> w t ....
[11:34:54] <Getty> nginx just thought "hey, i dont need to make sense, just go with it"
[11:35:00] <pilgrimish> can jquery be used to resize all of the images in this carousel collectively when browser is resized?
[11:35:00] <pilgrimish> http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/?page_id=136
[11:35:47] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[11:35:55] <robertmaxrees> though i'd look at using CSS instead.
[11:36:24] <checkit> Hey guys... Not a jquery pro but got a small simple little script here that I can't seem to get working: http://jsfiddle.net/1w8jbmbo/ Any thoughts would be great.
[11:39:52] <Getty> just seeing the progress bar of the XML HttpRequest on IE.... poor people who want to make fancy stuff with that.... (it starts with 24% like directly, and then jumps to 99% to hang like hell, while debugger shows clear sane flow)
[11:45:31] <pilgrimish> robertmaxrees: how could CSS do it? 100% widths?
[11:51:54] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: Sorry I stepped away myself for a bit. I just replaced everything I had with your script and the total is not updating at all now on click.
[11:53:52] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: $(window).resize(function() { … });   Or, depending on browser support, you might be able to use CSS width:100vw;
[11:55:04] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: using, but no dice
[11:55:05] <pilgrimish> $window.resize(function() {
[11:55:05] <pilgrimish>     $wrapper.height( $window.height() * 0.75 );
[11:55:06] <pilgrimish>     $carousel.height( $window.height() * 0.5 );
[11:55:07] <pilgrimish>   }).resize();
[11:55:08] <pilgrimish> sorry all
[11:55:15] <pilgrimish> didn’t mean that
[11:56:18] <pilgrimish> http://pastebin.com/jDLnZFNc
[11:56:37] <Zzaichik> So you've created variables for window?
[11:56:41] <Zzaichik> a variable*
[11:57:55] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: put the variables in the code snippet
[11:58:04] <Zzaichik> so I can try it out in the console
[11:58:09] <Zzaichik> on your carousel
[11:58:21] <ravigehlot> pilgrimish: what is the original question?
[11:59:08] <pilgrimish> http://pastebin.com/H02ezd1E
[11:59:34] <pilgrimish> ravigehlot: trying to work out how to resize all images collectively upon browser resize http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/?page_id=136
[11:59:35] <Zzaichik> that works...
[12:00:27] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: i think you’re seeing the breakpoints i’ve set
[12:01:15] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: when I run that snippet in console, it resizes the carousel, cropping the images.
[12:02:10] <jayjo> When I submit a form with ajax, how can I convert the login form to a loading spinner? I thought to use ajaxstart, but it looks to be called when ajax is called anywhere on the page
[12:03:57] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: yea, it adds a height to #page, but doesn’t resize the images. just crops
[12:05:10] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: yeah you should be able to handle the images following suit with CSS - they aren't currently resizing because your telling them explicitly NOT to go smaller than 612px.
[12:06:37] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: kill the CSS on the images that is trying to set the height and min-height for those images. Also, you aren't targeting the images in the jQuery.
[12:06:55] <Zzaichik> Either way should work.
[12:07:03] <Zzaichik> reset height or set height to auto on the images.
[12:07:33] <pilgrimish> i’ve removed the rules on those images
[12:07:41] <pilgrimish> and have them all set to 100%
[12:08:00] <Zzaichik> getting closer it looks like
[12:08:06] <Zzaichik> Now the parent elements are too wide.
[12:08:34] <Zzaichik> Oh - pilgrimish - no max-width: 100%;  it isn't necessary
[12:09:44] <pilgrimish> removed as well
[12:10:46] <Zzaichik> I'm still seeing it in a media query
[12:10:53] <Zzaichik> the landscape media query
[12:11:48] <pilgrimish> it’s commented out, just keeping track of what i’ve changed
[12:13:05] <Zzaichik> ahh
[12:13:07] <Zzaichik> yeah I see
[12:14:42] <Zzaichik> getting closer. Now the width is off for some reason, is that was you're seeing pilgrimish?
[12:15:27] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: the images are defaulting to their respective widths
[12:15:48] <pilgrimish> you mean the wrapper width?
[12:16:42] <Zzaichik> is that jquery snippet live?
[12:17:30] <brandonjjon> Zzaichik: Actually yes: http://tto-tx.com/tournaments/register/4
[12:17:39] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: hmm…  try $window.on('resize', function() {
[12:18:57] <brandonjjon> Zzaichik: Tick the optional checkboxes and you can see that it updates the total. If you want just fill out the form with random info but don't accept the terms and you can see what I'm talking about
[12:19:21] <brandonjjon> The boxes remain ticked but the total will be wrong
[12:20:03] <pilgrimish> no dice
[12:20:40] <Zzaichik> alright pilgrimish inside of that resize function, throw a console.log('working');  and lets make sure it's firing.
[12:20:49] <Zzaichik> hang on brandonjjon
[12:20:55] <brandonjjon> No worries
[12:23:05] <robertmaxrees> brandonjjon this was a while ago but my code may or may not work immediately.  but you should get the general idea.
[12:23:14] <robertmaxrees> you had an issue with a global var that breaks things
[12:24:23] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: definitely working
[12:24:26] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: I tried to make your script work but I couldn't even though it's very similar to mine.
[12:24:44] <robertmaxrees> let's spin up a test case in a fiddle and get it working then :)
[12:27:09] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: huh. change that console.log to this: console.log($window.height());
[12:27:56] <Zzaichik> AND pilgrimish make a variable  newHeight = $window.height();
[12:27:59] <robertmaxrees> brandonjjon so let's use this example: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/zn67j786/
[12:28:47] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/L5n4jb9j/
[12:28:49] <maddtechwf> how can I add a DOMContentLoaded in jquery?
[12:28:59] <robertmaxrees> maddtechwf you don't need one.
[12:29:41] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: Forgot to select jquery: http://jsfiddle.net/L5n4jb9j/2/
[12:29:49] <robertmaxrees> boom.  was just about to do that ;)
[12:29:51] <maddtechwf> I'm trying to run a function ever so many minutes.  How can I do that?
[12:30:07] <robertmaxrees> a recursive setTimeout() call.
[12:30:14] <robertmaxrees> you could also use setInterval if you wanted.
[12:30:39] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: But the issue is on page reload, the boxes remain checked but the total will revert to base 500. Don't think we can replicate that on jsfiddle. The live site is here: http://teamtrail.dev/tournaments/register/4
[12:30:48] <robertmaxrees> brandonjjon we can actually.
[12:30:50] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:30:51] <robertmaxrees> slow down.
[12:31:25] <brandonjjon> http://jsfiddle.net/L5n4jb9j/2/#&togetherjs=6SalCqqKVO
[12:31:31] <robertmaxrees> already working on it.
[12:31:51] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: done, don’t think that’s the intended output
[12:32:03] <robertmaxrees> brandonjjon so is there always going to be a 500?
[12:32:05] <maddtechwf> Sorry.  I'm not that great with jquery.
[12:32:18] <robertmaxrees> maddtechwf you don't use jquery for it - you use raw JS
[12:32:21] <brandonjjon> Yeah, but in the live app that fee is set in a hidden field
[12:32:29] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.  we'll fake that bit.
[12:32:30] <Zzaichik> Yep - that's the problem
[12:32:34] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: http://jsfiddle.net/wtvjgh3k/
[12:34:32] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: that seems to work
[12:34:46] <pilgrimish> ‘cept it’s not the window height
[12:35:52] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L5n4jb9j/3/ brandonjjon
[12:35:58] <robertmaxrees> this is closer to what you want.
[12:36:43] <robertmaxrees> and this should handle your pageload problem, too.
[12:36:47] <maddtechwf> I'm still not great at js.  Here is what I currently have for my function that runs on page load.  I just need to rerun the function every 1 minute.  DOMContentLoaded
[12:36:57] <maddtechwf> http://kopy.io/Hnzjw
[12:37:08] <robertmaxrees> maddtechwf domcontentloaded has nothing to do with waht you're asking.
[12:37:22] <robertmaxrees> brandonjjon feel free to swap out the baseLine for whatever you want.
[12:37:28] <maddtechwf> I didn't mean to past that.  I meant to paste the url.
[12:37:48] <robertmaxrees> maddtechwf are you trying to run an ajax call every minute?
[12:38:05] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: Oh hey look at that, it works! So.. in a nutshell what was the source of the problem? I was convinced it was just the onclick events not being fired after page reload.
[12:38:23] <robertmaxrees> the problem with what?
[12:38:24] <maddtechwf> Yes.  I need to check and see if there is any updated json data to display.
[12:39:02] <robertmaxrees> maddtechwf that's pretty easy.  check out setInterval()
[12:39:10] <robertmaxrees> rather, settimeout
[12:39:12] <robertmaxrees> !mdn settimeout
[12:39:12] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: WindowTimers.setTimeout() - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers.setTimeout
[12:39:28] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: I think that's the correct window height, and it's being applied to the #page element but not $carousel.
[12:39:40] <brandonjjon> The problem with the why the total wasn't updaing after page reload
[12:40:11] <robertmaxrees> i'd have to look at it again, but you were doing things like simulating clicks and stuff, which is never what you want to do.
[12:40:16] <robertmaxrees> don't proxy logic through the DOM.
[12:40:51] <Zzaichik> @pilgrimish are there styles being applied via jquery somewhere else that would be overwriting this? Maybe drop this resize function down below the Slick instance.
[12:41:05] <Zzaichik> This shit is buggy yo
[12:41:34] <pilgrimish> it’s an effin pain in my ass… seemingly trying to impossible here
[12:41:45] <pilgrimish> (and thank you for your help with this)
[12:42:53] <pilgrimish> and no overwriting, idthink
[12:43:41] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: no problem man, I bet the last issue has to be that the .slick() function is killing the height to the $carousel. so maybe target its parent? Unless, putting that resize function below the .slick works.  I mean, we are getting inline styles on that $carousel element from somewhere. Those are my last two thoughts on this things. haha - if they don't work, I'm at a lost man.
[12:44:23] <robertmaxrees> maddtechwf http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z7pbwyyk/ it'll look something like this.
[12:44:27] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: word. much appreciated. thanks for your time
[12:44:43] <robertmaxrees> though that's every second.
[12:44:47] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: I've minimized the script to this: https://gist.github.com/brandonjjon/946b25ac50e4ce21f3d7 - Do you see any problems with this? I just changed a few things.
[12:45:05] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle please.
[12:45:06] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[12:45:07] <robertmaxrees> test it.
[12:45:13] <robertmaxrees> and yes, i do.
[12:45:19] <robertmaxrees> parseInt() takes two args, not one.
[12:46:11] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: you gotta let me know if those work though. ;p
[12:46:18] <brandonjjon> Alright I'll fix that. Thanks.
[12:46:29] <robertmaxrees> brandonjjon this also doesn't take into account the default value.
[12:46:38] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: check it out
[12:46:42] <robertmaxrees> oh, yeah it does, nevermind.
[12:46:45] <robertmaxrees> just a weird way to do it.
[12:46:57] <pilgrimish> code is below the slick function now
[12:47:04] <Zzaichik> awwwww  yeah!
[12:47:23] <Zzaichik> that was it! we were getting conflicting assignments
[12:47:40] <Zzaichik> nice pilgrimish
[12:48:00] <pilgrimish> so now it’s a matter of getting the images to actually be full height of browser, and when resizing, maintain margins...
[12:48:31] <brandonjjon> Just curious. Is there a reason for doing var FuncName = function() {}   instead of just function X() {}
[12:48:50] <Zzaichik> assign window.width() to the images - but, that will make them take up the entire viewport.
[12:48:50] <robertmaxrees> one makes it clearer that functions are just objects.
[12:49:23] <Zzaichik> Or never mind, I misread.
[12:49:46] <robertmaxrees> brandonjjon this is a little cleaner - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L5n4jb9j/4/
[12:50:13] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: That looks nice.
[12:50:47] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L5n4jb9j/5/ some other fixes.
[12:50:54] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: A lot of new things for me in here with JS that I don't understand yet... but looks much cleaner for sure.
[12:51:05] <robertmaxrees> if you have questions, feel free to ask.
[12:51:17] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: before the resize function, right?
[12:52:13] <rochadt> hmm
[12:52:15] <brandonjjon> Well, one would be the function wrapping around it all. I assume just to sort of sandbox it. Anonymous function?
[12:53:01] <robertmaxrees> yep -- IIFE, or "Immediately Invoked Function Expression".  some people call that a "self-executing anonymous function", but that's not technically accurate.
[12:53:16] <robertmaxrees> vars in JS are scoped to functions, so this reduces global namespace pollution.
[12:53:52] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: yeah
[12:54:31] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: This is good stuff. Thanks for explaining things clearly. I enjoy learning these types of best practices early on
[12:55:48] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[12:56:40] <richie> How would I be able to display a message instead of it displaying NaN? http://jsfiddle.net/d74ktmwe/
[12:56:52] <richie> Oh hi robert :)
[12:56:57] <robertmaxrees> hello.
[12:57:04] <robertmaxrees> btw that's not how you use parseInt() :)
[12:57:33] <robertmaxrees> it takes two arguments - the value and a radis - parseInt(ppos, 10)
[12:57:34] <richie> but... but it works?? right? How would you do it?
[12:57:34] <robertmaxrees> *radix
[12:57:50] <robertmaxrees> "it works" doesn't mean much.
[12:57:53] <robertmaxrees> bugs everywhere.
[12:58:21] <robertmaxrees> if you omit the radix, some browsers treat the number as an octal if they start with a 0.
[12:58:46] <richie> So how would I properly add those two variables?
[12:58:51] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: $('.slick-slide') = $window.width(); right?
[12:59:12] <Zzaichik> Close.
[12:59:38] <Zzaichik> $('.slick-slide').width($window.width());
[12:59:42] <robertmaxrees> richie http://jsfiddle.net/d74ktmwe/
[12:59:44] <robertmaxrees> like this.
[12:59:49] <robertmaxrees> woops i mean http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d74ktmwe/1/
[13:00:06] <Zzaichik> or that won't work though - same problem as before. create a new var winWidth = $window.width();
[13:00:36] <robertmaxrees> richie the next problem is the way you're setting rev-result.
[13:01:08] <richie> Oh wow
[13:01:33] <robertmaxrees> let me show you a better way
[13:01:49] <richie> Okay
[13:02:21] <robertmaxrees> also - why all the inline CSS?
[13:02:43] <brandonjjon> robertmaxrees: Ran it through JS lint... http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/L5n4jb9j/5/
[13:02:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:03:50] <brandonjjon> It still works, I just ran it through JS lint and fixed a few warnings it was throwing. Anything wrong with it? Heh
[13:03:57] <richie> it's going to be used in wix, I don't think I can upload external files, unless you know a better way
[13:03:59] <robertmaxrees> you didn't show me the updates.
[13:04:06] <robertmaxrees> brandonjjon update the fiddle first.
[13:04:15] <robertmaxrees> and jslint is overly opinionated.
[13:04:21] <brandonjjon> Good point: http://jsfiddle.net/L5n4jb9j/6/
[13:04:25] <robertmaxrees> imo - i use a modified subset and jshint instead.
[13:05:07] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:05:14] <robertmaxrees> so don't use strict if you don't need it.
[13:05:31] <robertmaxrees> and ditch those comments since you don't need them.
[13:06:40] <baako> guys i want to launch that function the a link is is click http://kopy.io/0r7uy
[13:06:47] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you added some whitespace that i stylistically don't like and didn't change much else brandonjjon
[13:07:24] <robertmaxrees> richie do something with this instead: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d74ktmwe/3/
[13:07:29] <baako> i have a button which also fire that function now i want to add that class a
[13:07:31] <robertmaxrees> don't write out chunks of HTML if you can avoid it.
[13:07:54] <robertmaxrees> baako what's the issue you're having now?
[13:08:41] <maddtechwf> Thanks robertmaxrees
[13:09:49] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: $('.slick-slide') = winWidth; is throwing an error… what am I missing?
[13:10:04] <robertmaxrees> maddtechwf did that make sense?
[13:10:34] <robertmaxrees> richie aaaand http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d74ktmwe/8/
[13:10:46] <baako> robertmaxrees: well i want to call a function
[13:10:55] <baako>  http://kopy.io/0r7uy
[13:11:05] <robertmaxrees> i've gathered that much.
[13:11:07] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: So winWidth = $window.width(); right?  the other piece should look like this:  $('.slick-slide').width(winWidth);
[13:11:13] <robertmaxrees> baako what about that code isn't working?
[13:11:25] <baako> nope
[13:11:30] <robertmaxrees> because you could probably just do $('.scanQR').click(scanQR); and call it a day.
[13:11:53] <robertmaxrees> baako do you have two separate elements you want to call that on, #startScan AND .scanQR?
[13:12:04] <baako> yes robertmaxrees
[13:12:10] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: And you'll also want those to be inside the resize function. Actually, it'll probably be just fine if it all goes in the resize function the way it is.  Just make sure to add the winWidth variable to both outside and inside the resize function.
[13:12:15] <robertmaxrees> put a comma between them, not a space.
[13:12:18] <baako> basically if one of them class it fire the function
[13:12:21] <maddtechwf> Yes it did.
[13:12:33] <robertmaxrees> baako you want $('#startscan, .scanQR').click(scanQR);
[13:12:35] <richie> Oh wow, thats really cool, thank you
[13:12:56] <robertmaxrees> richie have your JS to less in this case :)
[13:13:31] <richie> I see, I'll keep that in mind next time, ty!!! :)
[13:13:33] <robertmaxrees> now, back to your original question - how to handle that pesky NaN issue.  two ways - one would be to validate/restrict input to numbers.  the latter would probably be your best bet.
[13:13:48] <richie> the latter?
[13:14:02] <robertmaxrees> between validating and restricting.
[13:14:08] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: roger that… thought it throws the layout
[13:14:51] <Zzaichik> what's the url again?
[13:15:30] <Zzaichik> And, pilgrimish tell me again what we're trying to do? Get the images to span the width or height of the window?
[13:16:08] <pilgrimish> full-screen carousel
[13:17:51] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: keep in mind, images will be distorted. What's the URL again?
[13:18:18] <pilgrimish> responsive, sorta like a full-width/height contact sheet
[13:18:26] <pilgrimish> http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/?page_id=136
[13:19:46] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: http://jsfiddle.net/h9hn2d9q/
[13:19:49] <robertmaxrees> richie does that make sense?
[13:19:54] <Zzaichik> need to target the images
[13:20:28] <maddtechwf> I'm getting an error in IE9.  Object doesn't support property or method 'matchMedia'.  Any work arounds for this?
[13:20:55] <richie> somewhat I'm trying to figure it out
[13:21:01] <robertmaxrees> maddtechwf https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js/
[13:21:05] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: :)
[13:21:07] <pilgrimish> check it
[13:22:27] <robertmaxrees> richie i'll save you some of the pain - http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d74ktmwe/18/
[13:22:31] <maddtechwf> I'm using respond.js already.  Does that load it already?
[13:22:38] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: nice.
[13:22:43] <Zzaichik> much closer.
[13:22:45] <robertmaxrees> maddtechwf...
[13:23:11] <Zzaichik> pilgrimish: to accomodate margins, you could probably add -32 to the end of the winWidth var.
[13:23:14] <robertmaxrees> read the docs yo :)
[13:23:33] <Zzaichik> still a little off but getting really close pilgrimish
[13:23:37] <Zzaichik> nice job
[13:23:38] <maddtechwf> robertmaxrees - I was reading and at the bottom it says that it's in respond.js already.
[13:23:55] <robertmaxrees> right, so check out the docs for the polyfill.
[13:25:23] <richie> Wait how did you do that?!
[13:25:35] <robertmaxrees> do what?
[13:25:38] <richie> what does the 48 and 57 represent
[13:25:51] <robertmaxrees> i can't remember.
[13:26:03] <richie> darn
[13:26:07] <robertmaxrees> this also breaks for numeric keypads, but it's the actual key that was pressed, not the value for it.
[13:26:21] <richie> Ohhhhhhhhh okay I see, that makes sense
[13:26:42] <richie> ty very much
[13:30:30] <pilgrimish> height is on now, i updated the snippet
[13:30:37] <t4nk030> Hi - I am not sure if anyone around here knows smth about Regex, but I am trying to achieve something like this "[0-3]?[0-9]"
[13:30:47] <pilgrimish> just a matter of maintaining widths as the carousel resizes
[13:30:55] <robertmaxrees> t4nk030 in plain english.
[13:31:12] <t4nk030> I am sorry
[13:31:53] <t4nk030> I am trying to achieve a regex that checks whether the value matches "12", "08", "8" but not "45" and higher
[13:32:07] <robertmaxrees> you want to know if the value is 12, 08, or 8?
[13:32:12] <t4nk030> 39 and higher, frankly
[13:32:21] <robertmaxrees> err.
[13:32:28] <robertmaxrees> you're changing what you want lol
[13:32:36] <t4nk030> 1 up to 39
[13:32:51] <t4nk030> with and without a 0 in front of single digit strings
[13:33:03] <robertmaxrees> don't use regex for that.
[13:33:22] <t4nk030> It's part of a date regex, pretty much
[13:33:26] <t4nk030> this is the regex I have now
[13:33:53] <t4nk030> "/(?!3[2-9]|00|02-3[01]|04-31|06-31|09-31|11-31)[0-3][0-9]-(?!1[3-9]|00)[01][0-9]-(?!10|28|29)[12][089][0-9][0-9]/"
[13:35:34] <robertmaxrees> http://www.regular-expressions.info/numericranges.html for more.,
[13:36:01] <robertmaxrees> ^[0-5]?[0-9]$ is probably the closest to what you want.
[13:36:11] <asm0deus> or break it into an array and compare each one separately
[13:36:39] <robertmaxrees> t4nk030 can you specify a function to do the check, instead of a regex?
[13:37:17] <t4nk030> this is pretty much what I use
[13:37:19] <t4nk030> http://jsfiddle.net/gsytsL46/
[13:37:43] <slax0r> hi, whats wrong with $(form-selector).submit(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); }); it doesn't stop the form from submitting
[13:38:01] <robertmaxrees> t4nk030 then do a test on the actual number instead.
[13:38:11] <robertmaxrees> slax0r make sure your selector is right.
[13:38:18] <robertmaxrees> and that the element exists on pageload, etc.
[13:39:08] <robertmaxrees> t4nk030 this is a lot easier with splitting things up and doing them as actual numbers.
[13:39:11] <robertmaxrees> instead of with a regex.
[13:39:21] <maddtechwf> This may be a dumb question but when my json doesn't have any data I get the following {"id":"null","status":"no alerts","description":"no alerts", "active":"no"}
[13:39:22] <asm0deus> yeah dont use regex
[13:39:24] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you'll want some kind of date validation lib.
[13:39:26] <asm0deus> for that
[13:39:33] <maddtechwf> My success still returns data.
[13:39:46] <robertmaxrees> maddtechwf what's generating the JSON?
[13:41:09] <maddtechwf> An instruction wrote it in laravel
[13:41:20] <robertmaxrees> then look in laravel?
[13:41:29] <asm0deus> ^
[13:41:33] <robertmaxrees> since that's where you're getting it from.
[13:42:00] <pilgrimish> Zzaichik: without needing to do the winWidth, things are in place… it seems. the only hangup is that the widths of the containers around the images remain static while the margins around the images grow instead of respecting CSS rules
[13:42:20] <asm0deus> maddtechwf: looks like its not clearing itself if empty dataset and keeping around that default set
[13:42:47] <maddtechwf> thanks.
[13:44:22] <slax0r> robertmaxrees: its a really simple site <form class="auto-form> .... <script src="all.js"> ... and in script $(".auto-form").submit(....
[13:44:50] <robertmaxrees> slax0r any console errors or anything?
[13:44:58] <robertmaxrees> is your JS after the form and/or in a document ready?  etc.
[13:45:02] <slax0r> in oh for the love of god
[13:45:28] <slax0r> mistakingly put an extra } -.-
[13:50:12] <Getty> hey, fontface jquery plugin? anyone? anyone? :-) there is one theoretical but the download link is dead, someone else got something? what i seek so far so not really good
[13:50:25] <robertmaxrees> Getty what are you looking for specifically?
[13:50:35] <Getty> dynamic loading of fonts
[13:51:48] <Getty> i dont want the browser to decide when to load them, i wnt to load them within the js after onload
[13:51:59] <robertmaxrees> O.o why?
[13:52:07] <Getty> cause my webserver has 64k of ram
[13:52:14] <Getty> reasoning enough?
[13:52:21] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:52:23] <Getty> lol
[13:52:30] <robertmaxrees> an actual reason would be nice.
[13:52:45] <Getty> that is the actual reason, the webserver is a bit on the failing part if there is too much connections at once
[13:52:54] <Getty> so shift-f5 actually always kills "some" connection which leads to missing assets
[13:53:00] <Getty> so i want them under better control
[13:53:11] <robertmaxrees> then limit the actual number of connections it can handle.
[13:53:18] <asm0deus> wtf
[13:53:21] <robertmaxrees> this isn't a JS problem, this is a config problem.
[13:53:25] <Getty> robertmaxrees: no its not
[13:53:30] <robertmaxrees> yes, it is.
[13:53:44] <Getty> robertmaxrees: no, you ever made microcntroller? i cant actually tell the browser to NOT do the 5 requests
[13:53:57] <Getty> and lwip has a serious problem like "keeping them" without doing anything as that would stick up the ram too
[13:54:28] <Getty> instead of tuning the poor ARM, i just want to take conrrol on the JS which is actually not a big deal
[13:54:37] <asm0deus> look up @font-face lazy load
[13:54:38] <Getty> i dont get why "loading fontface when i wanna load it" is a big deal or a topic of "thats not JS problem"
[13:54:52] <robertmaxrees> because it kicks the can down the road.
[13:55:01] <Getty> yeah i did, found some things, asked now here specific for someone having a good plugin suggestion, as the most known plugin cant be downloaded anymor (and most point to that)
[13:55:09] <Getty> robertmaxrees: no idea what the hell you talk about
[13:55:12] <robertmaxrees> your server should be limiting the number of connections, something just about every server software can do.
[13:55:25] <Getty> robertmaxrees: oh tell me how the server can do that and how the tcp connection must be handled in that case
[13:55:41] <robertmaxrees> what software are you using?
[13:55:42] <Getty> robertmaxrees: dued, we talk about a 64k of ram computer who ahndles the network and stuff
[13:55:55] <Getty> robertmaxrees: something i wrote?!?!?! there are no many "spcific webservers" for that case?
[13:55:56] <robertmaxrees> *sigh* whatevs mano.
[13:56:06] <Getty> dude, there is no "ready to go webserver" for 64k ram
[13:56:13] <Getty> (even i dont have 64k ram for the webserver)
[13:56:19] <asm0deus> why dont you get a real server
[13:56:22] <robertmaxrees> then fix up the server you wrote to limit the number of connections.  problem solved.
[13:56:23] <Velveeta> what fucking OS can even run in 64k of ram anymore, let alone a web server on top of it
[13:56:24] <Getty> its a hardware?!?!
[13:56:28] <Getty> he?
[13:56:33] <Getty> i do here stuff on REAL HARDWARE
[13:56:34] <robertmaxrees> otherwise accept that you're going to have these kinds of problems.
[13:56:34] <Getty> a device
[13:56:36] <Getty> you put in your room
[13:56:38] <Getty> and access via webserver
[13:56:42] <Getty> what the fuck is wrong with you peopel?
[13:56:48] <asm0deus> try #javascript
[13:56:49] <Getty> wanna change my problem just b ecause you want to say that this is stupid?
[13:56:51] <Getty> what the fuck?
[13:56:53] <robertmaxrees> woah
[13:56:59] <Getty> whatever ;)
[13:57:01] <Velveeta> we're not changing your problem
[13:57:07] <Velveeta> we're trying to get you to recognize the actual problem
[13:58:09] <Velveeta> and so he runs away
[13:59:16] <cod3munk> I'm trying to run an ajax call after an each loop, but the ajax happens before each is complete because its asyncronyous. How can I use jquery promise to make sure the each loop is finished before my ajax fires off?
[13:59:55] <Velveeta> well, the each loop itself isn't async, so as long as you put the call that kicks off the ajax request after the each loop, that's all you should need
[14:00:23] <Velveeta> or are you saying the each loop itself is an async operation?
[14:00:50] <cod3munk> no the each loop isn't
[14:01:12] <cod3munk> but it seems that the ajax is happening during the each loop instead of waiting
[14:01:22] <richie> what is the easiest way to add commas in jquery for a currency?
[14:01:50] <Velveeta> cod3munk: can you post a snippet of the code up somewhere so we can see how it's currently structured?
[14:02:16] <Velveeta> richie: i would imagine there are at least several plugins out there to do currency formatting like that
[14:02:31] <cod3munk> sure give me a few
[14:03:12] <asm0deus> richie: I spent a lot of time making something that does that at my last job, it had to account for everything, because parseInt allows E for scienfitic numbers something
[14:04:18] <asm0deus> richie: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3883342/add-commas-to-a-number-in-jquery that might help though
[14:04:58] <richie> I'll see what I can do, thanks guys :D
[14:17:03] <pilgrimish> i’ve got a container maintaining its width, while the image inside of it resizes with the others in a carousel… targeting it using $('.slick-slide').width(imageWidth); where imageWidth = $('.slick-slide img').width();
[14:17:57] <pilgrimish> not sure if i’m doing that right, but can jQuery keep the container at the same width as the image
[14:18:08] <pilgrimish> http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/?page_id=136
[14:19:35] <robertmaxrees> pilgrimish automatically?  because not really.  you'd need to resize both at the same time.
[14:21:25] <dropdrive> I have an HTML fragment to add using $("#mycontainer").html(fragment) -- is there a way to set the base url of this fragment?
[14:21:34] <pilgrimish> robertmaxree: so the image widths won’t naturally respect the resizing heights? assuming that’s what you mean by automatically
[14:21:41] <pilgrimish> dah. robertmaxrees:
[14:22:03] <robertmaxrees> pilgrimish i'm confused about your question.
[14:22:06] <Alecoalec> Is there a way to find out where the jQuery path is located through a command in console?
[14:22:12] <robertmaxrees> dropdrive not for that fragment, no.
[14:22:21] <dropdrive> robertmaxrees: Okay, thanks :(
[14:22:28] <robertmaxrees> dropdrive why?
[14:22:47] <robertmaxrees> Alecoalec that's an interesting question - what's the impetus?
[14:23:50] <Alecoalec> robertmaxrees: this site is trying really hard to hide the path of their scripts. I'm trying to see if I can get some more info before the countdown goes to 0 :)
[14:24:13] <robertmaxrees> Alecoalec use your network tab then.
[14:24:48] <pilgrimish> robertmaxrees: i’ve got a horizontal series of images each wrapped in a div, set to 100% height. when the browser resizes, the images resize with it, maintaing their aspect ratios, but the container div of each image doesn’t resize as well...
[14:25:04] <MarcGuay> Hi folks.  I'm using slick slider for a carousel and would like to test the loading screen - any suggestions?
[14:25:28] <pilgrimish> MarcGuay: what do you mean by loading screen?
[14:25:44] <robertmaxrees> pilgrimish hrm - sounds like you have styles applied to those parent containers that aren't adjusting.
[14:25:49] <Alecoalec> robertmaxrees: I did, everything is nested into one bundled JS file which uses RequireJS to load the rest of the scripts
[14:25:54] <MarcGuay> pilgrimish: slick-loading
[14:26:09] <MarcGuay> What is shown while it's loading the images.
[14:26:19] <robertmaxrees> iirc require still loads the scripts normally.
[14:26:24] <robertmaxrees> so the network tab should reveal everything.
[14:26:36] <Alecoalec> MarcGuay: Doesn't slick come with a loading gif swirly thingy?
[14:27:03] <robertmaxrees> Alecoalec why do you need the path in the first place?
[14:27:04] <MarcGuay> Alecoalec: I'm trying to customize it and it loads too quickly on localhost to see exactly what's happening.
[14:27:26] <MarcGuay> I've tried fudging the classes with inspector but thought there might be an easier way.
[14:28:35] <Alecoalec> MarcGuay: I mean if you're not loading very high-res images on the slider, you don't really have to worry much about the loading screen.
[14:28:57] <Alecoalec> I'm using Slick on a current project and it automatically lazy loads 8+ High Res 7MB+ images
[14:29:00] <jayjo> How do I use an ajax json response from the server to put error messages on my forms?
[14:29:19] <Alecoalec> robertmaxrees: May I PM you instead?
[14:29:32] <Alecoalec> robertmaxrees: Won't be too time consuming, I promise.
[14:30:21] <Velveeta> yeah even a requirejs bundle should show what it's loading via the network tab
[14:30:54] <Alecoalec> Velveeta: Well it's kind of hard to deduce since the bundle is also deobfuscated
[14:30:59] <Velveeta> you could probably also just search for something like 'sizzle' from the console search
[14:31:32] <Velveeta> but the state of the bundle itself shouldn't matter, because it would still have to load the file from disk by its proper name, unless they're obfuscating their filenames on the disk itself
[14:31:55] <cod3munk> Velveeta: here I have a jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/7h0rpkrb/
[14:32:11] <cod3munk> How do I make the ajax happen after the loop?
[14:32:13] <robertmaxrees> Alecoalec i kinda prefer the channel since others might have ideas, too.
[14:32:18] <robertmaxrees> but listen to Velveeta
[14:32:49] <Velveeta> cod3munk: it already is happening after the loop, check your console
[14:33:40] <Velveeta> you'l see 1000 logs of 'looping', then 'about to ajax' and then an error trying to kick off an xhr
[14:33:56] <acidjazz> how do i grab all form inputs w/ a .each
[14:33:59] <acidjazz> inputs/textareas
[14:34:12] <acidjazz> something like $('form.form :input, :textarea').each ?
[14:34:19] <acidjazz> can i specify two :'s
[14:34:31] <Velveeta> $(':input') should do it
[14:35:46] <cod3munk> Velveeta: In firefox console it shows 31 "looping" then the ajax call then 969 "looping" then "about to ajax"
[14:35:56] <Alecoalec> robertmaxrees: good idea. Line 41: http://pastebin.com/83iBZN32
[14:36:03] <cod3munk> Firebug rather
[14:36:05] <Velveeta> that's weird, in chrome i see it the way i described
[14:36:19] <cod3munk> I notice that chrome does behave as you describe
[14:36:21] <Alecoalec> This is deobfuscated using nicify
[14:36:28] <Velveeta> however, i can assure you that the for loop you've written there is a synchronous operation, and the ajax call after it will always wait until it's finished
[14:36:32] <cod3munk> Why the different browser behavior?
[14:36:48] <Velveeta> not sure, it may have some kind of deferred operation for writing to the console
[14:36:56] <Velveeta> maybe it just causes the messages to output in weird order
[14:37:24] <robertmaxrees> ff, chrome, and IE all treat things a little differently.
[14:37:28] <cod3munk> hmm ok interesting. I'll investgate further. Yes that loop is definitely synchronous
[14:37:37] <pilgrimish> robertmaxrees: styles are sound. when i check and uncheck width: auto CSS of the image within the div, the entire carousel falls out of whack, then resets itself to appear the way it’s intended to… does the resize function need to flush widths somehow? don’t know if that makes sense
[14:37:53] <Velveeta> ok, time for me to get up outta here
[14:38:00] <robertmaxrees> i have no clue - not going to be able to see your site for a bit.
[14:38:09] <robertmaxrees> gotta get something else done - I broke the build :D
[14:39:39] <pilgrimish> robertmaxrees: all good, thanks
[14:39:45] <pilgrimish> i’ll keep digging
[14:40:34] <ekkis> afternoon everyone.  I'm looking for a little advice.  I want to release a plugin which uses quite a bit of CSS but I don't want to include an additional .css file in the distribution.  so what I've done is coded the style into the plugin and attach a style node to the document.  I'm not entirely happy with the approach and I'm wondering what others do.  thoughts anyone?
[14:41:32] <robertmaxrees> why don't you want to include CSS?
[14:41:38] <robertmaxrees> that's a really common thing to do.
[14:41:48] <ekkis> you mean as a separate file?
[14:41:51] <robertmaxrees> yep
[14:42:05] <acidjazz> whats the way to execute only after .each is done again? .each().promise().done() ?
[14:42:14] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz put your code after the each.
[14:42:20] <robertmaxrees> no need to use promises.
[14:42:36] <ekkis> because if this is being used from a CDN then the single reference to the plugin is enough to make it all work.  if I have a second file the developer may forget to include the css and wonder why nothing works
[14:43:01] <robertmaxrees> ekkis that's a pretty common requirement.  lots of plugins require more than one file.
[14:43:32] <ekkis> robertmaxrees: I see... ok.  thanks for the input
[14:44:07] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: wha? no way that never works
[14:44:14] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: i thought .each was async
[14:44:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:44:34] <acidjazz> im pretty sure it is ive had issues with like.. incrementing variables/etc w/in each
[14:44:40] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[14:44:50] <robertmaxrees> it gets misused a lot, but it's sync.
[14:45:13] <acidjazz> then why have i been told specifically to use .promise().done() in the past in here?
[14:45:17] <acidjazz> and my code didnt work until then?
[14:45:18] <robertmaxrees> you have been?
[14:45:23] <robertmaxrees> by whom?  in what case?
[14:45:34] <acidjazz> trying to recall details
[14:45:36] <jayjo> i'm getting this odd error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for '74' in {"email": "This field is required.", "password": "This field is required."}
[14:45:37] <robertmaxrees> because i've seen that done and it didin't make any sense.
[14:45:42] <jayjo> WHich is my response from the server
[14:45:55] <robertmaxrees> jayjo jsfiddle your code maybe?
[14:46:13] <acidjazz> robertmaxrees: why do the functions exist th en?
[14:46:15] <acidjazz> then*
[14:46:37] <jayjo> http://jsfiddle.net/00pbhd7w/
[14:46:37] <robertmaxrees> .promise() and .done() are available for jquery objects for cases where you want to use promises.
[14:46:43] <robertmaxrees> but you don't generally need them for things like .each()
[14:46:47] <acidjazz> man i thought .each fired each iteration simulateneousely and hten .promise() made .done() fire when they were all done
[14:46:48] <jayjo> The error is where I'm trying to iterate over the dictionary
[14:46:59] <robertmaxrees> acidjazz http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/d298bjf6/
[14:47:01] <acidjazz> i must be confusing .each w/ something else
[14:47:29] <robertmaxrees> jayjo could you put in your code?
[14:47:32] <robertmaxrees> *data i mean.
[14:48:01] <jayjo> robertmaxrees: my response?
[14:48:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah
[14:48:58] <jayjo> console.log(response.responseText) produces {"email": "This field is required.", "password": "This field is required."}
[14:49:34] <robertmaxrees> jayjo try doing console.log(typeof response.responseText);
[14:49:36] <robertmaxrees> what do you get?
[14:50:12] <jayjo> hmm.
[14:50:13] <jayjo> string
[14:50:17] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:50:24] <robertmaxrees> easy fix - JSON.parse()
[14:51:12] <jayjo> thanks! it works
[14:51:42] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[14:52:20] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, remove the quotes around it from the response.
[14:52:26] <ircbaako> what string against define? http://jsfiddle.net/ehppvvjn/
[14:52:53] <robertmaxrees> ircbaako you're missing a + in there.
[14:52:59] <robertmaxrees> before the '</br>
[14:53:04] <ircbaako> :D
[14:53:08] <robertmaxrees> also, it's <br>
[14:53:43] <Intii> Hey everyone, I'm having a weird issue that I can't seem to resolve. I'm loading fancybox in the <head> of my html document and putting the fancybox code after the footer but I keep getting the undefined function error. If I load fancybox in the footer right before code that calls fancybox everything works...
[14:53:52] <Intii> jQuery is also loaded in the head but before everything else
[14:54:17] <robertmaxrees> Intii make sure you're only loading jquery once.
[14:55:07] <Intii> robertmaxrees: I am
[14:55:24] <robertmaxrees> Internet13 check the page source to make doubly sure.
[14:55:29] <robertmaxrees> and your network tab.
[14:56:30] <Intii> the page source only has one reference to jquery.js
[14:56:40] <Intii> wow your right
[14:56:43] <Intii> fucking wordpress
[14:56:46] <Intii> im so sick of this shit
[14:56:50] <robertmaxrees> it's always wordpress.
[14:57:48] <Intii> What else can I use instead of WordPress?
[14:57:55] <Intii> For future projects
[14:58:25] <robertmaxrees> some people make wordpress work just fine for them.  what sort of sites are you building?
[14:59:33] <Intii> nothing too crazy just basic sites. the only reason we use wordpress is because its easy for clients to make changes
[15:00:08] <robertmaxrees> i'd google around for "wordpress alternatives" and "cms alternatives'
[15:04:37] <io_____> hi how to get a class on the same level as 'this'  --->  $( this ).parent() then the a class or element inside parent
[15:05:01] <robertmaxrees> "same level" as in a sibling?
[15:05:04] <robertmaxrees> or a child?
[15:05:32] <io_____> i am sing find now but not sure if that s the best way
[15:05:39] <io_____> a child of parent
[15:05:48] <io_____> so at the same level of 'this'
[15:06:15] <io_____> so   $( this ).parent().find( '.myclass ')
[15:08:32] <robertmaxrees> or .closest() to get the parent container you want.,
[15:08:48] <robertmaxrees> or .siblings().
[15:09:11] <robertmaxrees> i tend to prefer .closest() to find the parent of the module or whatever, and then .find() to get the specific element i care about.
[15:09:52] <io_____> ok thanks
[15:18:06] <richie> this is the best thing I could find on the web, how could I make the results have commas in them without clicking the number? http://jsfiddle.net/ekhv4bLg/4/
[15:19:02] <robertmaxrees> use the keydown
[15:19:13] <robertmaxrees> brb

[15:49:34] <richie> welcome back
[15:50:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ekhv4bLg/11/ this is what you want.
[15:51:23] <richie> what what did you do? I only see the click part deleted... hmm
[15:51:37] <robertmaxrees> wait woops.
[15:51:38] <richie> oh addcommas, duh
[15:51:43] <robertmaxrees> the updates didn't work.
[15:51:49] <robertmaxrees> oh yeah it did haha
[15:51:53] <richie> what, they worked haha
[15:52:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah misread my own code.
[15:52:11] <richie> cool I learned something new :)
[15:52:13] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, just put the code where you want to use it.
[15:52:28] <robertmaxrees> i assume you don't have much experience with JS, yeah?
[15:52:52] <richie> Nope, just learning
[15:52:57] <robertmaxrees> learn.jquery.com
[15:53:11] <robertmaxrees> i strongly encourage going through this site then.
[15:53:29] <richie> Oh perfect, thank you
[17:19:09] <jayjo> On my second ajax request I'm getting this error:
[17:19:39] <jayjo> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token <
[17:19:50] <jayjo> on (index):1
[17:19:53] <acidjazz> dat means u gay
[17:19:58] <acidjazz> ur getting html back
[17:19:59] <acidjazz> not json
[17:20:03] <acidjazz> < is html
[17:20:13] <jayjo> thank god, I thought it meant I was gay
[17:20:17] <jayjo> thanks
[17:22:37] <robertmaxrees> hey, that's a little inappropriate for the channel ;)
[17:23:45] <snover> i see certain people are still keeping it classy in here
[17:24:15] <robertmaxrees> the CoC DOES kind of mention it sooo
[17:25:27] <systemfault> A CoC only means something if it's enforced somehow.
[17:26:30] <robertmaxrees> yep - which is why i'm mentioning that it's there and noting that what was said was inappropriate.
[17:34:42] <acidjazz> what ya mean the COC
[17:35:08] <robertmaxrees> the code of conduct - linked in the topic.
[17:35:25] <robertmaxrees> as the "rules" for the channel - bit.ly/jQIRCCoC
[18:47:30] <ThePendulum> I have an input form that currently only responds to submitting by hitting the enter key, not if you press the send button. Is there a way to combine evens into an if/or clause so I can check for either to happen?
[18:48:07] <axscode> hi guys anyone familiar with jquery flexslider, i wanted to know if its possible to change settings/options if its already initialised? Like i want to remove hoverPause event to false.
[19:02:04] <pilgrimish> how can I utilize jQuery to fix the issue of images overlapping one another when resizing
[19:02:05] <pilgrimish> http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/?page_id=136
[19:03:54] <pilgrimish> how might I go about dynamically updating widths
[19:09:18] <Mark_2> how do i use greensock?
[19:12:11] <ThePendulum> All those questions piled up and no messiah :P
[19:12:33] <pilgrimish> ThePendulum: such is life
[19:13:27] <systemfault> ThePendulum: Why would it work with the enter key but not the button? What event do you handle.
[19:14:48] <ThePendulum> systemfault: I'm basically blocking the form submit so the page doesn't reload until JavaScript does that. Now JavaScript responds to a form submit, but the button doesn't submit or the page would reload to the form's action file. Hence, I need to capture the button on click as well
[19:15:39] <ThePendulum> And basically tie it to the form submit which is only triggered on hitting the return key
[19:18:27] <systemfault> ThePendulum: In a normal scenario, you would handle the form submission by handling the 'submit' event of the <form>
[19:18:32] <systemfault> Can't you do that?
[19:20:42] <ThePendulum> systemfault: I am doing that but only the input and return key worked. For some magical reason the submit button now also works
[19:20:47] <ThePendulum> Not sure what went wrong there
[19:20:54] <systemfault> Weird.
[19:22:11] <pilgrimish> i’m setting a new width to all resized images, but the carousel is still maintaining static widths on the divs wrapping the images… any thoughts? http://www.beaconnected.com/ng_site/?page_id=136
[19:22:31] <ThePendulum> I hate when this happens. Something doesn't work, no errors, and suddenly it works again. It makes me anxious the issue will return at a less convenient time
[19:26:24] <ThePendulum> JuiceSSH is fantastic for minor changes on the go :D
[19:27:32] <ThePendulum> I think I've found the issue
[19:28:08] <Mark_2> is this correct? jQuery('.board_contents', top.document).fadeIn();
[19:28:10] <ThePendulum> Whenever I minimize my mobile browser, the socket disconnects for some reason, somehow without feedback
[19:28:47] <ThePendulum> I guess I might be able to put the feedback above the actual disconnect so the disconnected user at least still gets the message they got disconnected
[19:29:41] <pilgrimish> Mark_2: looks good to me. not sure about the top.document, but i’m pretty sure it’s sound (from my relatively noob eyes)
[19:30:14] <Mark_2> thanks pilgrimish. i don’t know why it doesn’tw ork then.
[19:31:19] <pilgrimish> what’s the site?
[19:31:32] <karl_pl> hey all! working on a jquery plugin. I have an each function iterating over a list of a tags, and in that each im doing a this.click function that isnt being called when I click on those a tags, any ideas what im doing wrong?
[20:06:37] <chequers> hi, I'd like to make a call to navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition on page load, but only execute its callback when another task (a $.get) has completed. how can I do this?
[20:07:27] <systemfault> Just do you getCurrentPosition thing in the callback of the $.get?
[20:08:07] <chequers> systemfault: wouldn't that delay getCurrentPosition until the get completed? I don't want that delay
[20:08:33] <systemfault> THat's what you asked.
[20:09:31] <chequers> I want to start the function immediately, because it might prompt the user for permission. But the success callback has to wait for the .git to complete before doing its thing
[20:09:45] <chequers> *.get
[20:10:12] <Mark_2> does anybody know why this doesn’t work?  jQuery('.board_read').fadeIn();
[20:10:38] <chequers> in the .get callback I can set a global variable and in the getCurrentPosition I can spin on that until it's ready, but I get the feeling it's not idiomatic jquery/js :)
[20:12:09] <pilgrimish> Mark_2: is your console throwing any errors?
[20:12:18] <Mark_2> nope.
[20:13:38] <Velveeta> chequers: return a promise object from your function that does getCurrentPosition, and add it to the promise returned from $.get, and pass them to $.when
[20:14:20] <pilgrimish> Mark_2: what’s the site?
[20:14:26] <Mark_2> http://lifeto.dothome.co.kr/xe/page_FIsv96
[20:14:42] <Mark_2> if you click on the first ‘click me’ button and then click the 1 titled article
[20:14:44] <chequers> Velveeta: that makes sense, how do I generate a promise object?
[20:15:11] <Mark_2> i want the layer that appears when i click on the ‘1’ to be faded in.
[20:15:28] <Mark_2> so i gave <script>
[20:15:29] <Mark_2>  jQuery('.board_read').fadeIn();
[20:15:29] <Mark_2> </script>
[20:15:35] <Mark_2> in that iframe
[20:15:35] <chequers> Velveeta: oh, it's jquery.Deferred() ?
[20:15:50] <mirko> be aware: i'm probably doing something totally wrong here - i'm having a global integer <ajax_calls = 0>. and want to increase / decrease it referncing the number of ongoing ajax calls. therefore i registered handlers (ajaxStart() / ajaxComplete()) to increase/decrease the var. however if simultaneous ajax-requests are fired (e.g. on onReady()) not every ajax-calls triggers that event..
[20:16:04] <mirko> long story short: how do i keep track of ongoing ajax calls?
[20:16:06] <pilgrimish> i don’t see the script in your code
[20:16:20] <Velveeta> chequers: within that function, just do something like return $.Deferred().resolve();
[20:16:30] <Velveeta> yepyep
[20:16:34] <Mark_2> hmm
[20:16:45] <Velveeta> just return it as already resolved so that it's ready to go the instant the $.get completes and resolves itself
[20:16:59] <pilgrimish> Mark_2: and I don’t see the “.board_read” element
[20:17:00] <Velveeta> and then the $.when will trigger immediately after $.get completes, and fire the callback you're looking to fire
[20:17:12] <chequers> Velveeta: nice!
[20:17:28] <chequers> Velveeta: i see there's even a way to pass back errors... cool
[20:17:53] <Velveeta> yepyep, once i wrapped my head around working with promises, it opened a whole new world of fun
[20:18:05] <mirko> in the end my var sometimes results in being "-1" :(
[20:23:24] <mirko> simply put: not every ajax call fires the ajaxStart() handler in my case
[20:26:24] <LiENUS> so trying to figure out a weird problem. i have a click event bound to my 'a' tags to make it so shift clicking goes to a different url, for some reason on my machine it opens in the same window (what i'd rather) but on my users machine it opens in a new window...
[20:27:12] <LiENUS> im using .preventdefault() in the click handler to prevent opening the url obviously... and i thought it would stop the opening in new window bit..
[20:30:27] <checkit> Hey guys.. Having some trouble getting this script to work. It's a small script. Any thoughts? http://jsfiddle.net/1w8jbmbo/
[20:30:37] <chequers> Velveeta: thanks, works beautifully and quite easy to pick up too
[20:30:44] <Velveeta> good to hear :)
[20:32:43] <chequers> one other question... my code looks like this: $.when( $.get( "servers.json" ), getLocation() ).done(function(servers, position) ...
[20:32:54] <chequers> how can I handle failures of the $.get?
[20:33:38] <chequers> ecause it seems the structure returned by $.get is just [data, "success", ???]. So do I just assume object[1] != "success" is a failure?
[20:35:11] <Mark_2> anybody know how to create this kind of animation effect using greensock? http://desimer.com/experiment/red/
[20:35:40] <Mark_2> like, if i click on the title,  apop up slides across the page from the top
[20:39:53] <Velveeta> chequers: you can chain promise callbacks off of your $.get call also, .done() for success handlers, .fail() for error handlers
[20:52:25] <fattest> why arn't my radio buttons not being selected upon clicking on the text? http://jsfiddle.net/x1mtr5vq/2
[21:02:50] <karl_pl> any idea why id be able to do a .css(left:0px) but not a .animate(left:0px) ? the css one sets it properly, but the animate leaves it as it is
[21:29:05] <chequers> hi, I'm using $.wait on a $.get and navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition, but I'd like the $.get to continue even if the navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition fails. How can I do this?
[21:29:32] <chequers> if the navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition call succeeds, I need the $.get data to handle the response. But if it fails, I need the data anyway
[21:30:05] <chequers> for responsiveness reaosns I'd like to start both at load-time, rather than chaining them sequentially
[21:33:23] <Uhkis> .always()
[21:34:28] <chequers> how do you mean I could use that?
[21:37:38] <Uhkis> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.get/#jqxhr-object
[22:24:20] <checkit> Hey guys.. Having some trouble getting this script to work. It's a small script. Any thoughts? http://jsfiddle.net/1w8jbmbo/
[22:30:23] <jayjo> checkit: you can only use push if it's a javascript object, not json
[22:30:24] <jayjo> json is a string
[22:30:53] <checkit> jayjo: Convert JSON string to JS object first?
[22:31:27] <jayjo> if you convert it to JSON then you won't be able to push to it the way you have
[22:33:04] <jayjo> I think you have to use items.push
[22:55:22] <fattest> My radio button is not being selected upon clicking on the text; please help http://jsfiddle.net/x1mtr5vq/2/
[23:24:14] <Mastema> I can't for the life of me get horizontal scrolling on fixed or vertical scrolling on absolute divs to work on mobile phones. Either way, jquery to either make the absolute follow the scroll, or the fixed to scroll horizontally. I haven't found a solution anywhere that works, can anyone give me advice?
[23:25:51] <Cork> Mastema: some browsers just don't support it
[23:26:05] <Cork> so the fallback solution is to hide the fixed element while scrolling
[23:26:27] <Cork> sadly you can't sniff for this, so you need to keep a list of the browsers that support it
[23:28:32] <Mastema> x.x that's disappointing to hear
[23:28:34] <Mastema> oh well
[23:28:57] <Cork> Mastema: ya, especially ios is lagging behind here
[23:29:12] <Cork> and ya, it disappointed me too when i first hit it
[23:29:43] <fattest> My radio button is not being selected upon clicking on the text; please help http://jsfiddle.net/x1mtr5vq/2/
[23:30:17] <Cork> fattest: you need to use <label>
[23:31:06] <Cork> ah, now i see, you try to fix it with js...
[23:31:24] <Cork> just use labels instead, it isn't needed to depend on js for this
[23:31:32] <fattest> ok
[23:31:37] <Cork> also you've misunderstood what .closest does
[23:32:02] <Cork> .closest looks for the closest parent that matches the selector
[23:32:07] <fattest> oh
[23:32:21] <Cork> it doesn't look for a closest rendered or something like that (it would be crazy expensive to do this)
[23:33:01] <Cork> but ya, give the input an id and use for="<the id>" on the label
[23:33:06] <Cork> and replace the <p> with the label
[23:33:10] <Cork> and things should just work
[23:34:00] <fattest> thank you so much Cork
