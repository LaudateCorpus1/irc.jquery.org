[00:14:20] <hazardous> hi, does anyone know why $.each() appears to load in random order based on browser, and is there any way i can make this consistent -- firefox is more  or less the only one that goes through elements in the order they appear in
[00:20:24] <explodes> Is there something that is the opposite of .not() ?
[00:20:44] <explodes> Like if I wanted to put on an additional thing like .andIsAlso('.something')  ?
[00:21:09] <explodes> (Instead of putting it in the original selector, which is unavailable at the score I am dealing with)
[00:21:57] <danheberden> explodes: not with the same exact api
[00:21:59] <danheberden> `is
[00:22:00] <b-ot> danheberden: is
[00:22:05] <danheberden> b-ot, stellar work
[00:22:10] <danheberden> `.is
[00:22:17] <danheberden> maybe? maybe that will work b-ot?
[00:22:52] <danheberden> annnnyway, explodes - http://api.jquery.com/is/
[00:23:03] <explodes> Perfect. Thank you
[00:23:29] <danheberden> explodes: re: different api's: http://ajpiano.com/the-opposite-of-jquerys-is-method-is-not-not-it-is-is/
[00:24:27] <danheberden> hazardous: iterating over objects or arrays?
[00:26:26] <danheberden> well, i'll assume you'll come back to this later. hazardous, arrays will be iterated over in numerical order because that's how arrays work, you have numerical indexes
[00:26:31] <danheberden> however, objects don't have any kind of order
[00:26:44] <danheberden> so when you iterate over an object, order is NEVER guaranteed
[00:27:03] <danheberden> if you need order, use an array
[00:27:24] <danheberden> if you need associative values in order, look up linked-lists or other ways to connect arrays to objects
[00:27:43] <iaj> Are there any problems/trouble when I use more parts of jquery... to use jQuery(document).ready(... multiple times on a page?
[00:28:13] <danheberden> iaj, assuming you aren't using it, like 1000000 times
[00:28:28] <danheberden> the only problem is not performance, but rather, it might make your code harder to maintain
[00:28:35] <danheberden> because you have bindings to document ready in multiple places
[00:28:43] <danheberden> but the performance overhead is moot
[00:28:44] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[00:28:50] <danheberden> MOO
[00:28:50] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[00:29:16] <iaj> danheberden: what do you mean by, assuming you aren't using it?
[00:29:17] <iaj> thanks.
[00:29:47] <danheberden> iaj, i meant you aren't using document ready a crazy amount of times
[00:30:08] <danheberden> it's just function calls, so no performance issues
[00:30:54] <hazardous> danheberden: sorry, new to irc and can't figure out when i got a new message
[00:31:30] <hazardous> i don't know the difference between object or array. it's a json document with a stack of things inside another thing. accessed via each data.x
[00:31:37] <hazardous> where {"x": {},{},{},{}}
[00:31:48] <danheberden> hazardous: that is an object
[00:31:50] <danheberden> object is a hash
[00:31:55] <danheberden> { key: "value" }
[00:32:01] <danheberden> where array's are numerically indexed
[00:32:03] <hazardous> so no chance of getting it to just load in the order it came in?
[00:32:06] <iaj> i see, thanks danheberden :)
[00:32:08] <danheberden> [ "value", "value2" ]
[00:32:12] <danheberden> hazardous: nup
[00:32:25] <danheberden> if you want order, use an array :)
[00:32:32] <hazardous> mmk ta mate
[00:32:40] <danheberden> ha, and there he goes
[00:32:50] <danheberden> or her
[00:32:59] <danheberden> tsk for assuming gender
[00:33:00] <iaj> danheberden: when I do a double binding to a submit, eg.   $('#buchungsformular').submit(function() {  … }   and $('form').submit(function() { … }     will they both be executed?
[00:33:16] <danheberden> iaj, you betcha
[00:33:28] <iaj> whats a betcha :)
[00:33:32] <danheberden> haha
[00:33:34] <danheberden> you're cute
[00:33:36] <danheberden> i mean, yes
[00:33:49] <danheberden> jQuery will see that you want to bind an event
[00:33:51] <danheberden> even if you already did
[00:33:58] <danheberden> who knows, maybe you *meant* to do that
[00:40:08] <anli> What is a good irc channel for asking ckeditor related questions?
[00:42:08] <danheberden> anli, if they don't have their own, maybe ##javascript or see if there's a mailing list or something
[00:42:09] <danheberden> ?
[00:42:29] <anli> ok
[00:42:50] <danheberden> anli i'd help, but i only know how to initialize ckeditor per their docs :p
[00:43:02] <anli> :)
[00:43:21] <danheberden> i miss it being called fckeditor
[00:43:29] <danheberden> it was more fun to pronounce
[00:43:55] <tw2113> +1
[00:44:05] <dns-away> :
[00:45:28] <superdo> any idea why my element doesnt hide w setTimeout? http://pastie.org/6161260
[00:46:33] <danheberden> superdo: because append doesn't take a function as a second argument
[00:46:56] <superdo> i read it on a cheatsheet
[00:47:10] <geiregjo> :D
[00:47:34] <geiregjo> terrible code style
[00:47:34] <danheberden> superdo: it could be much better, hold on
[00:48:04] <anli> haha
[00:48:21] <danheberden> superdo: ok, this paste thing fucking blows
[00:48:26] <danheberden> use gists bro
[00:48:42] <danheberden> unless you ain't a bro, then cross out the 'bro'
[00:51:17] <danheberden> superdo: https://gist.github.com/danheberden/4951411
[00:51:25] <danheberden> oops, those goddamn tabs
[00:51:49] <danheberden> superdo: i added that after the hide is done, it should be removed
[00:52:28] <danheberden> if you create the span and save that as a far, you can just use that var later
[00:55:41] <dns-away> .pussy
[00:55:54] <dns-away> ?pussy
[00:55:57] <superdo> danheberden, doesnt remove span
[00:56:34] <superdo> ahh
[00:58:01] <superdo> danheberden, nice, works, thx
[01:25:22] <ripthejacker> how can i use two different callbacks for slidetoggle() ?
[01:25:58] <ripthejacker> i.e i wanna toggle between the callbacks
[01:29:02] <Cork> ripthejacker: you can't
[01:29:17] <Cork> the multiple callback solutions are going away
[01:29:31] <Cork> just have a switch statement in the function and handle it there
[01:38:01] <ripthejacker> Cork, so how do i know the current state of toggle?
[01:38:27] <ripthejacker> i mean what to use as condition for switching?
[01:38:40] <Cork> ripthejacker: .is(':visible') is one option
[01:38:53] <ripthejacker> can i use toggle as a callback function in slidetoggle?
[01:38:54] <Cork> or you could just save the state in a variable
[01:39:13] <Cork> you mean $().toggle?
[01:39:17] <Cork> no you can't
[01:39:29] <Cork> and $.toggle for functions is deprecated
[01:39:35] <Cork> and is removed in 1.9
[01:39:46] <ripthejacker> slidetoggle(200,function(toggle(callback1,callback2)))
[01:39:53] <ripthejacker> ok
[01:39:53] <Cork> and $.toggle for functions is deprecated <--
[01:39:54] <Cork> and is removed in 1.9
[01:40:00] <ripthejacker> i get it
[01:40:02] <Cork> and no you can't do that
[01:40:11] <Cork> even in older versions
[01:41:42] <ripthejacker> i think there should be an option for 2 callbacks for slidetoggle
[01:41:58] <Cork> ripthejacker: why?
[01:42:09] <Cork> you can do the exact same thing with quite little code in the callback
[01:42:46] <Cork> if($(this).is(':visible')) {} else {}
[01:43:05] <ripthejacker> well since there are 2 different states there can be 2 diff callbacks
[01:43:09] <Cork> and thats actually more reliable then toggle is
[01:43:19] <ripthejacker> yes
[01:43:26] <ripthejacker> thanks a lot buddy
[01:43:34] <ripthejacker> Cork,
[01:43:37] <ripthejacker> +1
[01:46:26] <jomofcw> In an object I want to test the class of my object, doing get_class(self); doesn't work. Is there a correct way to do it please ?
[01:48:10] <Cork> jomofcw: js don't have class, its somewhat faked, but there really isn't a way
[01:48:24] <Cork> you can test what function was used to create the object, but thats it
[01:48:58] <jomofcw> oups... bad channel
[01:49:04] <jomofcw> Cork :D
[01:49:05] <Cork> heh
[01:49:08] <jomofcw> *wrong channel
[01:59:21] <iaj> hey there.. little question, how can I after having this: $('form').submit(function() {   now change the attribute of the .foo class beyond exactly this forms?   in case there are more forms than one?
[02:00:18] <Cork> iaj: you mean only match a form with that class or?
[02:01:26] <iaj> yeah the forms .foo class
[02:01:39] <iaj> the form which gets submitted.. only the .class inside there.
[02:01:42] <Cork> $('form.foo').submit(funciton() {})
[02:01:43] <iaj> .foo
[02:02:04] <iaj> hmmm Cork  yeah.. but this one I want to cover all the forms.
[02:02:17] <Cork> so don't use the class filter?
[02:02:32] <iaj> Eg. all forms should prevent double submitting by something like   $('.powermail_submit').attr('disabled', 'disabled');
[02:02:51] <iaj> but only there .powermail_submit resp.
[02:02:55] <iaj> their*
[02:03:32] <Cork> huh?
[02:03:54] <Cork> so your using a class on some forms to set a disabled attribute, and...?
[02:04:12] <seutje> once is perfect for this
[02:04:47] <Cork> seutje: do you understand what he's getting at?
[02:05:21] <seutje> think he wants to disable all forms from submitting once submit has been triggered on one
[02:05:48] <Cork> where does the class come in then?
[02:06:15] <tangorri> hi
[02:06:32] <seutje> guess he wants to diable the button instead of capture the form's submit event
[02:06:36] <tangorri> I try to use jQuery but I allways get 'Undefined variable: $' error ...
[02:06:38] <seutje> disable
[02:07:07] <Cork> tangorri: your most likely trying to use jquery before the jquery file has been loaded
[02:07:10] <seutje> tangorri: either jQuery is being run with noconflict or you're executing your code before jQuery itself was loadded
[02:07:49] <seutje> I generally wrap my shit in (function($){ ... })(jQuery); to avoid the noconflict issue
[02:08:26] <Cork> i usually don't use conflicting libraries
[02:08:33] <Cork> just plain refuses
[02:08:34] <tangorri> well, I just try to copy a toturial ... https://gist.github.com/tangorri/4951733
[02:08:53] <seutje> tangorri: if you haven't already, run through http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide8 real quick
[02:09:04] <seutje> actually, not just that slide, the entire thing :_
[02:09:09] <tangorri> ok thanks
[02:09:52] <tangorri> jQuery.noConflict() run? well no
[02:09:55] <seutje> tangorri: hmz, my guess is that <script src="js/jquery-1.9.1.min"></script> is hitting a 404
[02:10:08] <seutje> can u verify it is at that location and being loaded correctly?
[02:10:13] <tangorri> it is
[02:10:24] <Cork> without the .js?
[02:10:40] <seutje> ah, didn't even notice that
[02:10:40] <tangorri> hmmm maybe not : file://localhost/D:/Documents/Manechenea/Site%20Web/public/js/jquery-1.9.1.min  No request made.
[02:10:59] <tangorri> lol sorry about that :D
[02:11:18] <tangorri> works ! thanks guys !
[02:13:21] <ripthejacker> Cork, that worked fine thanks :)
[02:13:39] <Cork> yw:)
[02:14:55] <iaj> seutje, Cork sorry, coffee was empty :D   eyah.. .I want to prevent THIS forms .submit button from being submitted again.
[02:15:09] <iaj> .powermail_submit actually.
[02:15:16] <iaj> Or is there a better way
[02:15:40] <seutje> does that prevent submission in every browser?
[02:15:51] <iaj> seutje: dont think so :S
[02:15:59] <iaj> but in Chrome/Safari/Firefox I checked
[02:16:04] <seutje> I'd just hijack the submit event tbh
[02:16:12] <iaj> Like how?
[02:16:13] <sahbeewah> is anyone with tpg
[02:16:41] <Cork> iaj: just set a ex. a class on the form and check it in the submit callback
[02:16:59] <Cork> and if its set just to preventDefault() and bail out
[02:17:33] <seutje> $('body').on('submit', 'form', function(e){ var $this = $(this); if ($this.data('submitting')) { e.preventDefault(); } else { $this.data('submitting', TRUE); } }); or something?
[02:18:02] <seutje> or yeah, with a class, then u can style the button to disappear or something
[02:18:11] <Cork> true not TRUE, TRUE isn't a valid value in javascript
[02:18:24] <seutje> like form.submitting input[type=submit] { display: none; }
[02:18:27] <seutje> yeah, sry
[02:18:35] <seutje> knee-deep in PHP over here :P
[02:18:42] <Cork> :)
[02:19:22] <iaj> hehe... thanks buddies.. will check it out
[02:40:06] <renan_saddam> I am loading a html page with $.load, this html contains some <script /> tags on it. Is there a event that triggers whenever ALL scripts for that call have been loaded?
[02:40:40] <Cork> no
[02:40:52] <renan_saddam> damn
[02:40:57] <Cork> if they are in the body they are parsed before the call returns though
[02:41:21] <Cork> so the callback to the .load should work
[02:41:34] <discorpia> yeah, they should be done by the time the load is complete, since they will be run/executed on rendering(adding to dom)
[02:41:36] <Cork> unless the scripts in the html is aync
[02:42:18] <Cork> well not really, jquery will pull them out of the dom, but it will run them before returning
[02:45:47] <jivora> Hi, My jquery Ajax is working on Chrome but not on IE. What am I missing. Here is the code snippet. http://pastebin.com/fLAsucB0
[02:46:25] <seutje> jivora: Y U NO ASYNC? o.O
[02:46:26] <b-ot> seutje: (屮'Д')屮
[02:46:34] <Cork> ya
[02:46:37] <Cork> exactly
[02:46:45] <Cork> thats horrible user experience
[02:47:10] <Cork> also any parsing errors in ie?
[02:47:23] <jivora> I understand that. I have tried with Async = true. it did not work. That's when I turned it off. No No parsing error.
[02:47:51] <seutje> this isn't the last method ur declaring, right?
[02:48:32] <jivora> seutje : Last Method?
[02:48:59] <seutje> yeah, this getBeaconXML is a method on an object, right?
[02:49:12] <seutje> if it is the last, that comma at the end will trip IE up
[02:49:25] <renan_saddam> Cork: yeah, seems like the .load() callback does wait until everything is loaded, I had actually a complete callback, so it wasn't loaded yet
[02:49:41] <renan_saddam> what is the callback it triggers on .load ? Complete or success?
[02:49:57] <seutje> complete always fires, success only on success afaik
[02:50:15] <seutje> like complete fires, even when an error was thrown
[02:50:31] <treeprogram> Hi, does any one have experience with the Chosen plugin?
[02:50:50] <seutje> well, I guess not *always*, if you halt execution, execution will be halted :P
[02:51:01] <jivora> seutje: this.beaxonXMLUrl is a string. and I did not get which comma you are talking about. Thanks for helping me out.
[02:51:19] <seutje> jivora: line 20
[02:51:22] <seutje> the very last char
[02:51:46] <renan_saddam> complete callback seems to sufice what I wanted, thanks all :)
[02:51:50] <seutje> not sure why ur bringing up the url string thing
[02:52:08] <jivora> Oh ok.. No there are more methods after that.
[02:52:33] <seutje> k, then that shouldn't be an issue
[02:53:36] <seutje> jivora: wait a second, ur not using 2.0 beta, are u?
[02:55:15] <jivora> No I dont' think so. But let me try some other versions of jQuery. Be back in a minute.
[02:55:44] <seutje> yeah, cause 2.0 won't work with ie<9
[02:57:37] <jivora> No I am not using 2.0 I am using 1.9
[02:58:58] <beasty> hi guys
[02:59:14] <beasty> i'm trying to $.ajax() but my post ends up empty
[02:59:16] <beasty> any clue ?
[02:59:49] <cyro> What is the best way to namespace functions that I want to be globally called?
[03:00:12] <cyro> With coffeescript I've been scoping all of my functions by default
[03:00:19] <cyro> but some I want to be called else where
[03:00:25] <cyro> I'm new to javascript
[03:00:36] <cyro> would love to learn best practices
[03:06:24] <Cork> beasty: are you sending valid content in data: ?
[03:14:21] <soee> hi, i have attached function to ajacComplete event using $(body).on('ajaxComplete') ..
[03:14:54] <soee> is it possible to defne second event to call the same function when page is loaded ?
[03:17:13] <kapowaz> Can somebody confirm to me the behaviour of jQuery.noConflict(); — if you call it *after* you've used the $ shorthand throughout your code (e.g. third-party libraries), are those references to jQuery still maintained, or would they now point to whatever $ becomes after this point?
[03:26:19] <DarsVaeda> hi, on a mouseleave can I get the element where I go to?
[03:28:55] <beasty> Cork: i got no clue ;)
[03:28:59] <soee> is it possible to replace some content in some element (and/or if that element do not exist create it) ?
[03:29:02] <beasty> Cork: it's a base64 image

[03:40:49] <liox_> I'm developing an authentication system with jquery ajax () PHP and trying to save a session but the session is not being created in the first run someone can tell me why?
[03:46:08] <AdamPDotty> Is there a performance difference between $('#mydiv ul a') and $('#mydiv li a')?
[03:51:03] <soee> how can i find all elements inside container that have some value set ? (like all spans with some content)
[03:51:20] <AdamPDotty> content or attribute?
[03:51:56] <soee> AdamPDotty, content
[03:52:23] <AdamPDotty> theres no selector for content
[03:52:35] <AdamPDotty> you would have to use each()
[03:52:52] <AdamPDotty> and filter
[03:53:14] <soee> no content but there is html()
[03:53:20] <soee> i think this might be the way
[03:55:10] <sahbeewah> AdamPDotty, any task where that micro-optimization matters shouldn't be using jquery
[03:57:12] <sahbeewah> soee, $(selector).filter(function() { return $(this).html().indexOf(some_string) !== -1; });
[04:00:39] <liox_> staff knows someone tell me why ajax () and PHP is not creating my session?
[04:01:41] <liox_> only in the second session to reload the site works correctly
[04:05:19] <tlkr> liox_, I'm not sure that makes sense. You're starting the session using an ajax request after the page has loaded?
[04:09:47] <liox_> tlkr: So the page is loaded and I have a login form then get the data to a php page that checks the user and creates a session using the method ajax ();
[04:10:58] <DarsVaeda1> hi I have several layers of elements in a div, none of them is a div, the div has a class, can I check if one of the elements in that div is sibbling of this div without going all the way up?
[04:13:32] <seutje> DarsVaeda: u want to check if any of an element's children is a sibling of said element? o.O
[04:13:57] <DarsVaeda> I want to check if an element is in another element
[04:14:06] <DarsVaeda> even that is nested much
[04:14:40] <DarsVaeda> I only have the nested element and need to start there
[04:15:35] <DarsVaeda> ahh I guess it is parentsUntil
[04:16:05] <DarsVaeda> or at least similar
[04:16:07] <AdamPDotty> maybe closest
[04:16:26] <DarsVaeda> ahh yeah that sounds about right
[04:16:49] <AdamPDotty> $(innerElement).closest('#container').length
[04:17:44] <seutje> oh, sry, guess I misunderstood
[04:17:52] <seutje> well, I was kinda hoping I did
[04:18:20] <DarsVaeda> I often just explain too complicated :)
[04:27:37] <soee> i have tabs on my page, the tab that is not active is not visible and so they elements, is it possible anyway to count elements of inactive tab that will be visible when tab switch to active ?
[04:31:37] <superjacaman> Hey guys i'm with a strange issue .nextAll('.some') returns elements but .next('.some') returns nothing
[04:40:47] <brantje> How can i unbind all elements in an div?
[04:40:59] <brantje> Like input button, textarea etc
[04:41:49] <soee> how can i select elements that don't have set style display:none ?
[04:44:12] <AdamPDotty> $().not('[style*=display:none"]')
[04:44:17] <AdamPDotty> something like that
[04:45:12] <seutje> oh dear
[04:45:49] <seutje> won't work if it's spelled with a space, right?
[04:46:34] <Cork> AdamPDotty: that won't work
[04:46:51] <seutje> $('*').filter(function(){ return $(this).css('display') !== 'none'; }); ?
[04:46:53] <Cork> that would only work if its hidden through setting attributes
[04:47:12] <Cork> ya thats the correct way
[04:47:18] <seutje> still filthy as hell though
[04:47:28] <Cork> optionally through :visible
[04:47:37] <seutje> I'd hide the filth by using :visible
[04:47:38] <seutje> yeah
[04:47:49] <seutje> also filthy, but at least not blatantly :D
[04:47:58] <Cork> well it does the same thing
[04:48:02] <Cork> just not in your face :)
[04:48:26] <joelbirch> actually, I think :visible takes into account more than just display:none
[04:48:30] <Cork> soee: the real answer is prob to hide the elements by adding a class instead
[04:48:36] <lejocelyn> hi, do you think it's ok to do that :
[04:48:37] <Cork> soee: then select based on that class
[04:48:37] <lejocelyn>  var $items = $(this).attr("class"),         $last = $items.find('$items:last');
[04:48:52] <lejocelyn> or that might be the reason my script doesn't work
[04:49:19] <Cork> lejocelyn: that would more or less never work
[04:49:28] <lejocelyn> :)
[04:49:29] <lejocelyn> ok
[04:49:34] <Cork> class is a space separated string of class names
[04:49:41] <Cork> find expects to use dot for classes
[04:50:03] <Cork> and if you put in element names in your class; you should use a data-target element or something instead
[04:50:19] <joelbirch> lejocelyn: do you mean $('[class]').last()  ?
[04:50:35] <reloadz> hi! can anyone help with .hover()? http://jsfiddle.net/HmaAY/1/
[04:50:44] <Cork> joelbirch: thats even worse...
[04:50:58] <reloadz> why when i hover the div that i display automaticaly hides the div?
[04:51:06] <reloadz> when i hover ither elements...
[04:51:07] <reloadz> http://jsfiddle.net/HmaAY/1/
[04:51:12] <reloadz> other*
[04:51:17] <joelbirch> Cork: just trying to see what she wants. Maybe I came in too late :)
[04:51:29] <lejocelyn> joelbirch: Cork  what I want is to select the last element of the items' class
[04:51:47] <CannabisToke> when is a good time to use a mysql table? If I have a json object of 100 or so http urls, img urls and a name for each. should I include it as an object in my script or is it ok to get it from a database? lets say I had 100,000 users, which would perform better, querying for that same data or just having it in a js file?
[04:52:02] <Cork> lejocelyn: last element or last in the string class?
[04:52:09] <lejocelyn> last element
[04:52:22] <seutje> $('.foo').last() ?
[04:52:24] <joelbirch> lejocelyn: I see, so I guess that's doable if there is only one class, not sure if multiple
[04:52:38] <CannabisToke> still trying to understand when to use a database and when not to
[04:52:46] <Cork> joelbirch: it is doable with multiple too
[04:53:05] <lejocelyn> it's with multiple class
[04:53:14] <Cork> lejocelyn: so you want to select all elements that has the same set of classes as the current element
[04:53:19] <Cork> and then get the last one of those?
[04:53:29] <seutje> CannabisToke: mysql tables are pretty useless if you don;t need the relational aspect of it imo
[04:53:41] <lejocelyn> to remove it if I click on the delete button or clone it if I click on the add button
[04:53:42] <seutje> CannabisToke: SQLite is essentially JSON, isn't it?
[04:53:46] <lejocelyn> Cork: yes
[04:54:08] <CannabisToke> I don't know, still new to the database arena. I will read about sqlite
[04:54:10] <Cork> lejocelyn:  $('.' + $(this).attr("class").split(' ').join('.')).last()
[04:54:29] <joelbirch> Cork: nice
[04:54:34] <lejocelyn> waouh
[04:54:36] <lejocelyn> :)
[04:54:53] <seutje> Cork: sry to be a dick, but that single instance of double quotes is throwing me off :P
[04:55:15] <Cork> seutje: ya, i copied the source of the class :)
[04:55:20] <Cork> +es
[04:55:29] <seutje> AHA!
[04:55:42] <reloadz> why dose the div closes whan i hover other elemnts in it? http://iepazities.lv/friend/1/
[04:55:43] <seutje> should have known your typing is too fast for a mere mortal
[04:55:52] <Cork> lol
[04:56:54] <seutje> I don't see any divs disappearing, reloadz
[04:56:58] <seutje> also, wtf? <script type="text/javascript" src="http://iepazities.lv/js/config.js" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></script>
[04:57:08] <elijah> Noob question: I want to use console to tell me how many times the word issue appears on http://drupal.org/node/1913062 I am thinking I can do something like $(SELECTOR HERE).count(); Can someone point me in the right direction on a good way to do so?
[04:57:09] <reloadz> not my script
[04:57:12] <seutje> blackscript!
[04:57:33] <joelbirch> reloadz: your demos don't work for me, but use 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave' instead of 'mouseover' and 'mouseout'
[04:57:33] <reloadz> seutje: hover the div that slides out....
[04:57:48] <reloadz> joelbirch: will try
[04:57:52] <Cork> lol style on a script?!?
[04:57:54] <seutje> I've hovered pretty much every pixel on here
[04:58:06] <seutje> Cork: yeah, it's blackscript
[04:58:51] <Cork> elijah: no, jquery works on dom, thats on element level
[04:59:20] <elijah> Cork: Would I use JS then?
[04:59:21] <Cork> elijah: if you want to select on word level your better of just serializing the dom and searching through it as a string
[04:59:22] <reloadz> joelbirch: THX - WORKS FINE :)
[04:59:36] <Cork> elijah: well jquery is js so...
[04:59:41] <joelbirch> reloadz: yup :)
[05:00:16] <elijah> Cork: Would I then use JS to search through the serialized output? Does it do regex?
[05:00:17] <Cork> elijah: just do something like $('parent that contains all the text').text().match(/issue/).length - 1
[05:00:42] <Cork> (i never remember if match works on the regex or the string >_<)
[05:00:44] <elijah> Cork: Thanks, I will try that!
[05:01:08] <Cork> opps
[05:01:14] <seutje> Cork: hmm, my solution is a bit silly, perhaps: var count = 0; $('*').each(function(){ var $this = $(this); if ($this.children().length) {return;} count = count + ($this.text().split('issue').length -1); }); console.log(count);
[05:01:15] <Cork> you need /issue/gi
[05:01:29] <StephenS> How can I create jquery notification which will show new row inserted in db?
[05:01:40] <Cork> seutje: lol
[05:01:47] <seutje> I SUCK AT REGEX, OKAY?
[05:02:20] <StephenS> seutje, its not okay
[05:02:48] <Cork> StephenS: well first you need to pick a way to get the information from the server to the client
[05:02:58] <seutje> my count wasn't even accurate, lol
[05:03:05] <Cork> if your ok with limiting it to new browsers i would go with websocket
[05:03:09] <StephenS> Cork I know everything I just need logical part
[05:03:22] <StephenS> I know, one div, call to ajax, check db for new rows, come back and show notification
[05:03:23] <seutje> elijah: alternatively, u could use chrome, search for 'issue' and read out the "x of x" :P
[05:03:39] <StephenS> But how should I check for new rows? Set some constant time, and then compare if there is new messages??
[05:03:40] <Cork> and showing a message should be as simple to just appending to a list and a simple css style for that
[05:04:06] <elijah> seutje: lol, so true! This is a good exercise for me anyways.
[05:04:10] <Cork> StephenS: the server would push to the client that a new row is added
[05:04:21] <Cork> StephenS: thats what i meant by the server has to tell the client
[05:04:44] <StephenS> Cork I prefer not to use websocker when other technics are available, however so time comparing is good idea?
[05:04:54] <Cork> longpull
[05:04:58] <Cork> or commet
[05:05:10] <Cork> long pull is that the client open a connection to the sever
[05:05:22] <Cork> when the server has something new to say it sends it and closes the connection
[05:05:26] <Cork> and the client connects again
[05:05:45] <Cork> comet is that the client asks, and if the server has something to say, it sends it
[05:05:55] <StephenS> Why dont I use just ajax?
[05:05:57] <Cork> commonly the client asks like twice a second
[05:06:13] <Cork> StephenS: comet and long pull is ajax
[05:06:22] <Cork> but the server can't connect to the client
[05:06:30] <Cork> so the client has to create the connection
[05:06:44] <Cork> thats why websocket is so much nicer
[05:06:52] <seutje> long pull is how you melt apache :P
[05:06:59] <StephenS> nginx*
[05:07:01] <Cork> (you get a stable dual directional connection)
[05:07:25] <seutje> u actually get a proper persistent connection
[05:07:28] <StephenS> so comet is the same as websocket?
[05:07:36] <seutje> instead of some thing lingering in near-timeout
[05:07:42] <Cork> StephenS: not by far
[05:07:49] <seutje> it's a workaround
[05:08:03] <Cork> StephenS: comet keeps connecting to the server and asks for an update
[05:08:17] <seutje> comet/long polling is stil regular http
[05:08:18] <Cork> StephenS: websocket creates a connection handchake with the server
[05:08:26] <Cork> that then both can use to push data to the other side
[05:09:24] <seutje> if I had web sockets the last time I made a long polling app, I wouldn't even have considered long-polling tbh
[05:11:42] <elijah> jQuery 1.2.6 supports :nth-child() correct? The docs say it was in 1.1.4 but I am not getting it to work.
[05:16:57] <elijah> If $(".node-content p") returns 2 objects, then wouldn't $(".node-content p:nth-child(1)") return one of those objects? I am running this in the console, the site is on 1.2.6 http://drupal.org/node/1913062
[05:17:33] <AdamPDotty> maybe nth-child(1) is a div, not the p
[05:18:58] <elijah> AdamPDotty: According to the example here (http://api.jquery.com/nth-child-selector/) it should be the p, if I can read right :D
[05:22:08] <sahbeewah> elijah, what you're looking for is :eq(1)
[05:22:34] <elijah> sahbeewah: lol, yeah I just reread the docs and came across that I did in fact did read wrong!
[05:23:04] <elijah> "The :nth-child(n) pseudo-class is easily confused with :eq(n), even though the two can result in dramatically different matched elements. With :nth-child(n), all children are counted, regardless of what they are, and the specified element is selected only if it matches the selector attached to the pseudo-class. "
[05:30:14] <elijah> seutje: .match(/issue/) is returning the first occurrence
[05:30:57] <seutje> elijah: like Corksaid, use /issue/gi
[05:31:06] <seutje> for global and case-insensitive
[05:32:02] <seutje> I do know that much of regex :P
[05:32:02] <elijah> seutje: I missed that comment, that is awesome and thanks for the explanation!
[05:39:56] <elijah> seutje: Turns out there are some issues that don't have the word issue in them. How would I select all the #text nodes returned by $(".node-content p:eq(1)") (http://ubuntuone.com/2verjT14Z1JS3WeI198bLL)
[05:40:08] <elijah> That would be accurate
[05:40:36] <seutje> ?map
[05:41:42] <seutje> fuck you too b-ot
[05:42:17] <Cork> elijah: dom doens't really expose textnodes that much
[05:42:23] <seutje> $('.node-content p').eq(1).map(function(){ return this.innerText; })
[05:42:33] <Cork> so your prob better of just working with the content of the dom elements
[05:42:38] <Cork> ^ like that
[05:42:46] <Cork> uh, wait no
[05:42:55] <seutje> wow wait, that's inherently only 1 element
[05:43:06] <Cork> seutje: that will return weird jquery objects
[05:43:14] <seutje> yeah, ur right
[05:43:31] <Cork> $.map($('.node-content p:eq(1)'), function(elm){ return elm.innerText; })
[05:43:44] <seutje> $.map($('.node-content p').eq(1), function() { ... }); ?
[05:43:49] <seutje> fuck u type too fast
[05:44:00] <seutje> I'd avoid that sizzle-specific selector though
[05:44:38] <Cork> $.map($('.node-content'), function(elm){ return $(elm).find('p').first().text(); })
[05:44:51] <Cork> but i'm not sure i like that any better then the other one
[05:45:43] <elijah> That worked, now how do I count how many lines it returned?
[05:45:51] <Cork> .length
[05:45:52] <elijah> length returns 1
[05:46:02] <seutje> [0].length :P
[05:46:08] <Cork> then that is the number of lines returned
[05:46:34] <seutje> note that cork's last example works differently (and prolly closer to what ur looking for)
[05:46:46] <seutje> as the ones before that would run map for no reason at all
[05:47:06] <Cork> $.map($('.node-content p:eq(1)'), function(elm){ return elm.innerText; }) should be close to the same too
[05:47:08] <elijah> I am using $.map($('.node-content p:eq(1)'), function(elm){ return elm.innerText; })[0].length
[05:47:14] <seutje> cause of the eq
[05:47:18] <Cork>  no not [] at the end
[05:47:38] <Cork> that would count the length of the first stirng
[05:47:40] <Cork> *string
[05:47:46] <seutje> but there will always only be one
[05:47:53] <elijah> $.map($('.node-content p:eq(1)'), function(elm){ return elm.innerText; }).length returns 1
[05:47:59] <Cork> does :eq() do the same there?
[05:48:04] <seutje> yeah
[05:48:04] <Cork> ah
[05:48:11] <Cork> so $.map($('.node-content'), function(elm){ return $(elm).find('p').first().text(); })
[05:48:16] <seutje> it's not like :nth-of-type or something
[05:48:40] <seutje> u want the first paragraph of every .node-content, right?
[05:49:08] <elijah> no, the second paragraph of .node-content
[05:49:15] <Cork> heh
[05:49:25] <Cork> so $.map($('.node-content'), function(elm){ return $(elm).find('p').eq(1).text(); })
[05:49:48] <Cork> but that will most likely not work
[05:50:02] <Cork> cause what http://ubuntuone.com/2verjT14Z1JS3WeI198bLL points at you don't have any elements for that content
[05:50:16] <Cork> its just a blob of text with br elements in it
[05:50:25] <elijah> Yes, but it does list the correct ones as #text
[05:50:29] <Cork> so your better of treating it like that
[05:50:39] <elijah> So I was thinking there was a way to count those.
[05:50:41] <Cork> ya, but you can't really select on that
[05:51:02] <seutje> u could clone & .remove children in the clone
[05:51:08] <elijah> $.map($('.node-content'), function(elm){ return $(elm).find('p').eq(1).text(); }).length  still returns 1
[05:51:14] <seutje> that should leave you with text nodes, right?
[05:51:22] <Cork> $('.node-content').html().split('<br>')[1]
[05:51:34] <seutje> lol
[05:51:43] <seutje> what if it was spelled <br /> ?
[05:51:45] <seutje> :P
[05:51:51] <Cork> tough luck...
[05:52:05] <seutje> but but... I always type em like that
[05:52:07] <Cork> wait...
[05:52:08] <seutje> or rather
[05:52:15] <Cork> doesn't text() replace br with \n ?
[05:52:26] <Cork> $('.node-content').text().split('\n')[1]
[05:52:31] <Cork> might work
[05:52:31] <seutje> no, it should just ignore them
[05:52:40] <Cork> your sure?
[05:52:45] <seutje> no
[05:52:47] <seutje> lol
[05:52:55] <seutje> I'm never sure till I actually try it myself
[05:53:16] <Cork> bah, ya it does
[05:55:54] <Cork> actually...
[05:56:22] <Cork> $('.node-content')[0].childNode[2] should work...
[05:56:27] <Cork> a bit uggly but....

[06:07:34] * delboy1978uk googles stopPropagation();
[06:10:45] <Surkow|laptop> Since yesterday, I figured out animations are asynchronous. I used fadeOut and encountered glitches when I used a callback afterwards. Turns out fadeOut sets the object to display:none. So I figured it was better to switch to .animate({opacity: 0}, 500, function() etc
[06:11:00] <Surkow|laptop> but then my problem still wasn't solved
[06:11:19] <Surkow|laptop> the callback was executed after the fadeOut function ended
[06:11:26] <Surkow|laptop> but the animation wasn't finished yet
[06:11:43] <Surkow|laptop> so I figured I could use something like .promise().done()
[06:11:55] <Surkow|laptop> but it's not exactly bullet proof
[06:12:13] <Cork> Surkow|laptop: replace fadeOut with animate
[06:12:16] <Cork> don't use both
[06:12:29] <Surkow|laptop> yeah
[06:12:32] <Surkow|laptop> I switched to animate
[06:12:48] <Surkow|laptop> so no more glitches of disappearing objects
[06:13:03] <Surkow|laptop> but now the fading still glitches
[06:13:09] <Surkow|laptop> I'll make some test case
[06:13:13] <Cork> glitches how?
[06:13:26] <Surkow|laptop> I made a gallery with autoplay
[06:13:30] <kurol> there's an animation queue
[06:13:32] <Surkow|laptop> you can also press forward/next
[06:13:41] <Surkow|laptop> if you start button mashing
[06:13:41] <Cork> anyway i got to run
[06:13:51] <Surkow|laptop> the animations start glitching

[06:14:35] <Surkow|laptop> kurol, any tips on how to control which animations are used?
[06:14:56] <Surkow|laptop> I have two images which I user as buffers. I crossfade between them and switch them around.
[06:15:00] <lejocelyn> is it normal that, if I clone one text input that uses autocomplete from jquery-ui, the clone doesn't autocomplete ?
[06:17:48] <lejocelyn> the .load or .autocomplete fonctions, are they only once activiated ?
[06:18:15] <lejocelyn> how to reload them after a change is done to the page ?
[06:18:29] <kurol> not really, but I'm noticing a lot of methods in http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/ I've never used before that sound helpful. like .dequeue, .delay, lfinish
[06:19:07] <Surkow|laptop> hmm
[06:19:07] <kurol> there's also a custom jquery :animated pseudoselecter that lets you know if you're selecting something that's in animation
[06:19:08] <Surkow|laptop> ok
[06:19:12] <Surkow|laptop> yeah
[06:19:16] <Surkow|laptop> I wanted to use it
[06:19:26] <Surkow|laptop> but promise waits until _all_
[06:19:28] <Surkow|laptop> operations are done
[06:19:41] <Surkow|laptop> including the animation queu
[06:19:42] <kurol> yeah, I'm still trying to learn how to use promises. I suck at those.

[06:55:51] <keirlav87> when using raphael, does text-anchor : start attribute make the coordinates of the text relative to top left?
[06:56:11] <beasty> still pondering if a $.post field is limited by size
[06:56:26] <abelitoPito> delboy1978uk but you see what im doing ?
[06:57:01] <delboy1978uk> no, you have to click UPDATE, then paste the new URL
[06:57:36] <abelitoPito> ok
[07:05:39] <^Mike> Is there a way to make an animate call block?
[07:09:06] <johnkpaul> ^Mike: no, but you can pass a callback
[07:09:16] <johnkpaul> if you want something to happen after it is over
[07:10:14] <^Mike> I do, but I have several animations I want to do in sequence, and that can get ugly
[07:12:05] <delboy1978uk> abelitoPito http://jsfiddle.net/delboy1978uk/nKRsf/4/
[07:12:40] <abelitoPito> thanks
[07:13:42] <abelitoPito> delboy1978uk but i want when i click in other place its not a menu
[07:15:31] <Surkow|laptop> kurol, http://surkow.dyndns.org/wcg-1/
[07:15:35] <Surkow|laptop> demo of what I was talking about
[07:16:12] <delboy1978uk> try 'body' instead of document
[07:16:24] <delboy1978uk> http://jsfiddle.net/delboy1978uk/nKRsf/6/
[07:16:32] <delboy1978uk> now you can click anywhere in the body
[07:16:39] <delboy1978uk> instead of a button
[07:17:01] <Surkow|laptop> my current issue is the fact that sometimes .prop("src", img[img.current]); doesn't seem to be done
[07:17:06] <Surkow|laptop> I use two images A and B
[07:17:21] <Surkow|laptop> I fade from A to B, while inserting the next image src in B
[07:17:36] <Surkow|laptop> so B needs to be loaded before A fades to B
[07:17:53] <Surkow|laptop> if you start smashing the next button, it also interferes with the interval
[07:18:19] <pachet> 1. load the image and add a listener to determine when the image is ready before you allow the transition to happen
[07:18:25] <pachet> 2. each time the button is clicked, clear the interval
[07:18:35] <pachet> (im sorry if im missing details, i just jumped in)
[07:18:44] <Surkow|laptop> hmmm
[07:19:01] <Surkow|laptop> pachet, http://surkow.dyndns.org/wcg-1/
[07:19:02] <Surkow|laptop> demo
[07:19:21] <Surkow|laptop> I'll read into adding a listener
[07:21:21] <Surkow|laptop> <pachet> 2. each time the button is clicked, clear the interval
[07:21:40] <Surkow|laptop> but the interval executes the nextImage function
[07:21:57] <pachet> clear it and reset it?
[07:22:02] <pachet> i havent looked at the demo
[07:22:24] <Surkow|laptop> might be better to check it, since I massively overengineered a simple thing like this
[07:22:25] <Surkow|laptop> :P

[07:23:37] <kurol> Surkow|laptop: sorry, about to head out. afk-ish
[07:23:39] <Horttcore> I've found one a while ago but can't remember the name
[07:23:46] <Surkow|laptop> ok
[07:23:49] <Surkow|laptop> no problem
[07:24:49] <NoiseEee> sketch.js?
[07:24:57] <Surkow|laptop> pachet, I also preloaded all images. But that gives me no guarantee :(
[07:25:22] <Surkow|laptop> I dislike the fact that the animations don't end when the callback function is called
[07:25:24] <Horttcore> yeah it was sth like sketch.js
[07:25:38] <Horttcore> but it was for children to colorize a given image
[07:26:33] <boulet101010> any idea to simplify this ? http://pastebin.com/2dSppw92

[07:28:39] <gusti> hello
[07:28:49] <BillCriswell> boulet101010: This code seems awfully weird.
[07:28:54] <BillCriswell> What's your goal?
[07:29:18] <delboy1978uk> abelitoPito de nada amigo! :-)
[07:30:17] <delboy1978uk> boulet101010 hard to say, can you paste it with html in jsfiddle?
[07:30:24] <boulet101010> retrieve the index of the h3 in $("#tabbord > h3") that has active_session as an id
[07:30:30] <boulet101010> section*ù
[07:30:33] <GreyTrilby> Hi guys - looking for a little help with some JQ validation - need at least one publication date of the two in my code to be filled in. Have tried using 'depends' but it doesn't seem to work. I know i'm missing the obvious - can someone take a look and shove me in the right direction please? http://jsfiddle.net/R8FtU/
[07:30:59] <boulet101010> i think it's really easy but i'm being distracted every 2 minuts by my neighbour
[07:31:11] <boulet101010> concentration issue
[07:31:21] <boulet101010> not coding, so won't use jsfiddle
[07:31:50] <keirlav87> is there an inbuilt function to unescape html?
[07:32:14] <BillCriswell> $('#tabbord').find('> #' + active_session ).index() maybe? I'd have to play around with it a bit.
[07:32:18] <gusti> .seen gandul

[07:35:57] <BillCriswell> boulet101010: http://jsbin.com/ixuxuc/3/edit might be a bit better.
[07:36:21] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of an example that when something is clicked it slides the parent div to another area and fades out?
[07:37:35] <boulet101010> thank ou BillCriswell  i love you
[07:37:47] <delboy1978uk> GreyTrilby example of needing at least one checkbox clicked http://jquery.bassistance.de/validate/demo/
[07:37:54] <boulet101010> that's exactly what was hidden by my lack of concentration
[07:38:15] <BillCriswell> boulet101010: Happens to everyone.
[07:38:28] <BillCriswell> It's early in the morning so I waste all my good brains on everyone in here.
[07:38:40] <BillCriswell> When I start working I'll fade out.
[07:38:46] <delboy1978uk> lol
[07:39:21] <boulet101010> xD

[07:40:14] <boulet101010> good ol' samaritan
[07:40:24] <boulet101010> i do this work for my learner
[07:40:36] <boulet101010> and i'm a learner myself
[07:40:38] <boulet101010> with no tutor
[07:40:50] <GreyTrilby> delboy1978uk - that's what I've been trying to work with, but it's not looking at checkboxes - it's looking for values, and while I tried replacing 'checked' with ':blank' i'm still hving no joy :(
[07:41:14] <BillCriswell> boulet101010: Yeah I'm self taught.
[07:41:34] <^Mike> Is there a limit to how many .ajax requests can be pending a response?
[07:41:34] <BillCriswell> Well... besides the countless tutorials and stuff.
[07:42:00] <delboy1978uk> that still counts!
[07:42:15] <delboy1978uk> unless it was in a clasroom
[07:42:29] <BillCriswell> delboy1978uk: Haven't been in one of those since high school!
[07:43:09] <BillCriswell> ^Mike: Not sure there would be a set limit.
[07:43:34] <boulet101010> i took studies back since last year, the biggest part of work is the support of schoolmates
[07:44:10] <boulet101010> "communication", hardest skill to improve when you're a geek
[07:44:30] <^Mike> BillCriswell: No, I didn't expect there would be a limit in jQuery. Maybe the browsers only permit a certain number of outstanding requests? or there might be a limit in the protocol somehow
[07:44:31] <GreyTrilby> @boulet101010 - so very true - it's the reason many of us have such a poor reputation.
[07:45:05] <GreyTrilby> boulet101010 - I hve the opposite problem - I'm great at communicating, a bit shit at coding :P
[07:45:10] <boulet101010> hehe, that's fun because we create the tools for the other to communicate
[07:45:30] <BillCriswell> ^Mike: I know you're limited to 6 parallel downloads when loading a site at the same time (from the same domain ) or something like that.
[07:45:45] <GreyTrilby> the Geek WILL inherit the earth - if they can work out where it's being inherited FROM, and how to style it to their liking
[07:45:48] <boulet101010> GreyTrilby, you should learn more languages, I mean like russian, and brainfuck.
[07:46:10] <GreyTrilby> I really want to learn rssin actually - I did a little at school (in addition to french, german and latin!)
[07:47:32] <Forbidd3n> Anyone know of an example that when something is clicked it slides the parent div to another area and fades out?
[07:47:38] <MeMReS> Russian is hard to learn, I used rosetta stone learned all the sounds the letters make and how to say hello / goodbye and I don't understand russian
[07:48:12] <BillCriswell> ^Mike: http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/04/11/performance-research-part-4/
[07:48:16] <GreyTrilby> I've used a little pimsleur - it's actully very good - need to pick it up gain
[07:48:35] <^Mike> cool
[07:48:41] <^Mike> BillCriswell: ok, thanks
[07:48:44] <boulet101010> as in brainfuck MeMReS , you can understand the way it works, know how to say "hello world", but when you're in front of the source code of another guy, it's like russian.
[07:49:19] <MeMReS> lol
[07:49:43] <GreyTrilby> even worse when the comments are in russian too ;)

[07:58:31] <bcardarella> Is there a jquery function to iterate over an array and return the first match found or false/undefined if no match found?
[08:00:44] <Brodingo> bcardarella theres $.inArray()
[08:05:08] <gnarf> bcardarella: not directly, but what kinda of "search" are you looking for?
[08:05:24] <gnarf> like, if you mean a selector, .filter( selector ).eq(0) will be the first
[08:05:25] <bcardarella> gnarf: $.inArray does what I need :)
[08:05:30] <bcardarella> Brodingo: ty
[08:05:47] <gnarf> it doesn't take an iterator tho does it?
[08:06:20] <gnarf> bcardarella: http://underscorejs.org/#find
[08:07:06] <bcardarella> gnarf: I really only care about knowing if the value exists in the array so $.inArray works
[08:07:10] <bcardarella> thank you though
[08:11:37] <ctorp> if I have x = $('#x'); xCont = x.html(); x.text("something"); x.html(xCont);   ...... I get the content of X back to a default state, but I lose any bindings. Is there a better way to do this?

[08:16:26] <Forbidd3n> anyone on how I can animate the slide of an element from one parent to another?
[08:16:27] * csotelo is excused for the nickname
[08:16:39] <csotelo> gnarf, sorry for the dumb question, which one ?
[08:16:40] <Forbidd3n> I can move element from one parent to another, unsure how to animate the slide
[08:17:04] * csotelo feels something dumb
[08:17:07] <gnarf> csotelo: ##twitter-bootstrap
[08:17:51] <gnarf> Forbidd3n: it would be near-impossible/rough to do and look good
[08:18:20] <gnarf> unless everything is already position: absolute
[08:18:23] <gnarf> in which case
[08:18:35] <gnarf> you could do some math to figure out the offset diffs
[08:18:44] <gnarf> from .offset() before and after the move
[08:18:47] <Forbidd3n> the element would be positioned absolute the parents could be relative, no
[08:18:49] <Forbidd3n> ?
[08:18:55] <gnarf> yeah
[08:19:21] <Forbidd3n> gnarf: could you give a simple example? I can't seem to get the animate down
[08:19:35] <Forbidd3n> I can post what I have so you can see what I have so far
[08:19:41] <gnarf> sure
[08:19:44] <gnarf> fiddle it up
[08:19:48] <gnarf> im afk for like 5 tho

[09:02:23] <djQuery> how do you show a dialog in jquery mobile with code? $('#addExpense').dialog().dialog('show');
[09:10:14] <djQuery> anyone? http://jsbin.com/oduyut/2/edit
[09:10:33] <djQuery> got code to work that hides it fine but how do you show it manualy?
[09:10:45] <iDope> Any UI Gurus. Quick question. I have a popup which shows the user some information that they have generated and there is a form within the popup to send that information to someone. Once the form is filled and the e-mail is send the user receives a clean ajax update in the same pop-up that their work is done. My boss wants the popup to close with a timeout automatically whereas I think the user should use the big close button. What are your reccommendations?
[09:11:57] <iDope> djQuery, The show and hide buttons are working fine I think.
[09:12:35] <iDope> on 2nd thought yes its not working. lemme see
[09:13:52] <shoky> djQuery maybe this helps some  http://jsbin.com/oduyut/3/edit
[09:15:22] <iksik> hm, updated code http://jsfiddle.net/aKYEL/9/ - the biggest problem of this code occure, when You drop one container into another one, and these 2 merged containers into third container - weird things happen ;-/
[09:15:58] <shoky> djQuery you can also change the button to:  <a href="#addExpense" data-rel="dialog" data-transition="pop" data-role="button">Add Expense</a>
[09:16:35] <djQuery> shoky, no I need to do some work before showing the dialog ie reseting a form
[09:16:56] <shoky> no idea
[09:17:01] <djQuery> I found it $.mobile.changePage
[09:17:25] <djQuery> iDope, in that case add an function to the open even
[09:17:35] <djQuery> iDope, wait
[09:17:46] <djQuery> let me re-read
[09:18:27] <iDope> its not a technical question. Its about design choice. The user might have to wait up to 5-10 seconds to get the result for the e-mail. I dont want it to automatically close after that.
[09:18:50] <iDope> Since the user might have diverted his attention and might miss the result.
[09:18:58] <djQuery> iDope, I think its fine to close it after waiting an appropiate time
[09:19:16] <iDope> Ok. then. Boss 1 - Me 0
[09:19:17] <iDope> :)
[09:19:49] <djQuery> iDope, the problem is coming up with the appropiate time and canceling out the timeout if the user manualy closes the dialog
[09:20:33] <djQuery> iDope, it would suck if they closed it and opened a new one and the timeout was still running and closed the new one before they were through with it
[09:27:53] <killtheliterate> any advice on using jquery to check for an element, and if it doens't exist, check for it again? another script is inserting elements into the dom, and i'd like to modify them once they exist
[09:31:23] <djQuery> killtheliterate, see ?domcreate
[09:32:02] <djQuery> ?newContent
[09:32:10] <djQuery> lazy bots
[09:32:40] <djQuery> killtheliterate, so kill all babies then?
[09:32:54] <killtheliterate> haha!
[09:33:11] <djQuery> killtheliterate, actualy read that backwards illiterate
[09:33:21] <djQuery> see if this will help https://gist.github.com/gnarf37/1003630
[09:34:38] <killtheliterate> djQuery: i'll take a look at that
[09:37:15] <_julian_> hi
[09:37:45] <_julian_> I am using raptor-editor on my page. I initialize it with $("#text").editor(...), which works quire well
[09:37:49] <djQuery> dang indexdb looks like a pain
[09:38:10] <_julian_> now I want to close it from javascript, which I thought would work with $("#text").editor().destroy(), but this does not seem to work.
[09:38:21] <_julian_> http://www.raptor-editor.com/docs/symbols/$.editor#destroy
[09:38:25] <_julian_> am I using this somehow wrong?
[09:40:47] <shader> is there an equivalent of $.grep for objects?
[09:41:21] <djQuery> .editor('destroy');
[09:41:29] <keirlav87> how can I delay an ajax call until after another one has finished executing its success callback?
[09:41:29] <djQuery> _julian_, ^^^^
[09:41:52] <djQuery> keirlav87, call that ajax in the success of the first one?
[09:41:55] <shader> i.e. copy an object, but only keeping certain elements?
[09:42:18] <_julian_> djQuery: aaaah, thank you
[09:42:19] <djQuery> shader, select only those object then call clone
[09:43:00] <shader> I'm working with a plain object though
[09:43:26] <shader> unless you can select attributes in a plain object?
[09:43:54] <shader> the predicate I want to use is effectively "!(key in array)"
[09:43:59] <djQuery> shader,v ar cloned =  $(plainObject).find('whatver').clone()
[09:45:03] <djQuery> var x = $.map(plainObject, function(){     if (this.whatver){ return; }})
[09:45:12] <djQuery> ?.map@shader
[09:45:27] <shader> oh
[09:45:32] <djQuery> dnag lazy bot
[09:46:03] <killtheliterate> djQuery: using ajaxComplete. seems silly, but works
[09:46:03] <djQuery> shader I am not sure abou the 1st method and I do know the 2nd method will work but not very familar with it
[09:46:25] <djQuery> killtheliterate, remember that fires on succes and failure
[09:46:38] <killtheliterate> djQuery: cool
[09:46:45] <djQuery> killtheliterate, so if the 2nd needs info from 1st dont expect it to be there
[09:47:21] <killtheliterate> just using html() to change some content, once it exists. i'll put a sanity check prior to changing the content
[09:48:02] <djQuery> this looks realy good http://nparashuram.com/jquery-indexeddb/index.html
[09:56:15] <_julian_> djQuery: I try to call destruct now, which takes a parameter, I try it like this: $('#description').editor('destruct(false)') - but nothing happens
[09:57:31] <jita> How to fetch title of a html page given its url using query ?
[09:57:34] <bdesham> I'm using jQuery 1.9 and doing something like var promise = $.ajax(...); promise.then(...)
[09:57:39] <jita> jquery*
[09:57:53] <bdesham> where can I find documentation for the parameters passed to the functions I pass to .then()?
[09:58:32] <djQuery> _julian_, .editor('destruct', false);
[09:58:55] <bdesham> jita, you mean title like the content of the <title> element? you'll have to load the page using $.ajax() or similar and parse the result
[09:59:19] <jita> bdesham, can i make cross domain ajax call ?
[09:59:37] <djQuery> jita, window.title
[09:59:55] <bdesham> jita, in some situations; not sure what yours is
[10:00:03] <_julian_> djQuery: hm, still nothing happens
[10:00:23] <bdesham> djQuery, I think jita is talking about getting the <title> of some *other* page
[10:00:26] <jita> bdesham, I have external link like google.com, and i want to fetch its title
[10:00:26] <djQuery> _julian_, dunno
[10:00:45] <djQuery> bdesham, ahhhh good luck
[10:04:43] <shoky> bdesham: the parameters passed to the callbacks are those that the promise was resolved/rejected with
[10:04:45] <bdesham> jita, you might look into $.get(), but once you get the page (by whatever means), it's going to be difficult in general to parse the page to find its title. I don't think jQuery has support for that; look into a JavaScript HTML-parsing library
[10:05:30] <bdesham> shoky, ok. I'm new to using the promise system; where can I find information about exactly what that means? ;-)
[10:05:44] <shoky> bdesham: that depends on what promise you're talking about..
[10:06:02] <gnarf> bdesham: http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[10:06:19] <jita> bdesham, can i get the page from external domain? I though ajax calls are restricted to external domains
[10:06:22] <bdesham> shoky, ok, that was my next question--so the parameters depend upon the context in which the promise was created
[10:06:28] <maxmoore14> can someone help me debug this weird widget problem? http://jsfiddle.net/AaDfz/1/
[10:06:42] <maxmoore14> seems to be an issue with the _delay method
[10:07:05] <shoky> bdesham: ^ and you might wanna take a look at this too even tho its old http://www.erichynds.com/jquery/using-deferreds-in-jquery/
[10:07:19] <bdesham> jita, I don't remember how those restrictions work... try googling
[10:07:21] <shoky> `g deferred
[10:07:22] <b-ot> shoky: Deferred Object | jQuery API Documentation → http://api.jquery.com/category/deferred-object/
[10:07:31] <shoky> jus'checkin
[10:08:31] <bdesham> shoky: thanks. I guess the .promise() documentation was too high-level for me; I'm using it with $.ajax(), which has got to be very common, so I'll look for an example of that usage in particular
[10:08:50] <shoky> bdesham: just noticed you were asking specifically about $.ajax.. then take a look at the docs for $.ajax specifically the 'success' and 'error' callbacks
[10:10:03] <bdesham> shoky: so the syntax is basically .promise(successCallback, failureCallback) where those two callbacks have the exact same signature as the ones I would pass to $.ajax()?
[10:10:14] <bdesham> I think I've got it now
[10:10:22] <shoky> if you mean .then, yeah ;p
[10:10:24] <dcherman> bdesham: no, it's .then( success, fail )
[10:10:40] <bdesham> shoky dcherman: yeah, that's what I meant :-P
[10:12:09] <isleshocky77> I've been using $.post($form.attr('action'), $form.serialize(), doSomething); forever without issues; however, now whenever I have $form.serialize() or $form.serializeArray() it changes it from a POST to a GET. Any ideas?
[10:12:39] <isleshocky77> I took the output of .serialize() and hardcoded it into a string, and as soon as there is an "&" making it more than one field it changes over to a GET rather than a POST
[10:14:06] <djQuery> maxmoore14, looks pretty good
[10:14:07] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:14:08] <BillCriswell> isleshocky77: That's definitely weird. Can you replicate it for a demo?
[10:14:17] <BillCriswell> WHO, WHO WHO
[10:14:31] <maxmoore14> djQuery: thanks, but do you see the error I'm talking about?
[10:14:38] <isleshocky77> BillCriswell: Let me play with fiddle or something.
[10:14:47] <djQuery> maxani, I see it in console but still reading the code
[10:17:31] <djQuery> maxmoore14, one of the handlers is doing that
[10:17:31] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:17:51] <djQuery> maxmoore14, I would think that the only handler you are adding is the on keyup handler
[10:17:52] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:19:10] <djQuery> also I don't know if jquery mobile is using the version of the widget factory that has  this._super
[10:19:39] <maxmoore14> verion 1.3 does
[10:20:15] <maxmoore14> I'm using rc1 right now, cause final will drop soon - well before my project is done
[10:20:25] <djQuery> maxmoore14, it definetly downlike your handlers
[10:20:25] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:21:07] <maxmoore14> yeah, but it is fine with the key handlers
[10:21:25] <maxmoore14> just the focus/paste ones are bad
[10:22:21] <djQuery> maxmoore14, might try asking in the jqueryui-dev
[10:22:22] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:22:56] <maxmoore14> ok, I'll try that, thx
[10:23:18] <djQuery> maxmoore14, throwing some watches and break points in there shows that handler: 18
[10:23:19] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:23:20] <StephenS> I'm jquerizied
[10:23:42] <djQuery> maxmoore14, message me
[10:23:43] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:26:26] <StephenS> AdamPDotty, me
[10:28:31] <keirlav87> so if i have an animation set to run on each iteration of an .each loop the next iteration of .each fires before the animation has finished?
[10:33:58] <ansimation> i'm working on a perpetual carousel and i'm 95% there. if you click the left arrow a couple times (or even once) then go to the right ( all the way to box 10 ) you will notice box 10 ( if you clicked left once, or 9/10 if you clicked twice, or 8/9/10 if you clicked left 3 times, etc. ) is missing. doesnt get put back to the other side for some reason and I have no idea why. Any ideas?  You can see it here http://97.97.254.70/tests/carousel/ or c
[10:33:58] <ansimation> heck out the source here https://github.com/TravisBallard/Carousel
[10:36:52] <jedimind> woah taht is the most cyclical js ive ever seen for a carosuel
[10:37:00] <Raydiation> im currently writing unittests in jasmine. how can i test if $.draggable was bound?
[10:37:01] <jedimind> it literally spikes my CPU to 100% for abotu 3 seconds each time i hit < >
[10:38:28] <ansimation> interesting
[10:38:50] <jedimind> why not take a look at like jcarousellite
[10:38:54] <jedimind> and see how they do it
[10:39:03] <jedimind> its like a 2kb carousel library
[10:39:10] <jedimind> s/library/plugin
[10:39:47] <Raydiation> just assert the ui-draggable class?
[10:40:39] <gnarf> Raydiation: whats the purpose of the test?
[10:40:46] <gnarf> you want to ensure its a ui-draggable widget?
[10:41:00] <gnarf> .is(":ui-draggable") i think, as of 1.10
[10:41:33] <Raydiation> gnarf: ty, btw is there any way to assert the options that are passed in?
[10:42:10] <gnarf> Raydiation: you can look at .data("ui-draggable").options again, 1.10 (use just "draggable" in <=1.9)
[10:42:30] <Raydiation> gnarf: awesome :)
[10:42:42] <Raydiation> otherwise id have to use dependency injection to test this stuff
[10:43:10] <pallet> Hi all
[10:43:46] <jedimind> HELLO PALLET
[10:43:48] <gnarf> `k yay!
[10:43:48] <b-ot> gnarf: (╯°□°）╯︵¡ʎɐʎ
[10:43:50] <pallet> can someone help me, http://jtable.org/ApiReference#genopt-addRecordButton I'm reading this help, but I'm not sure how to implement it as the help doesn't seem too helpful
[10:44:14] <jedimind> help me, read help, help doesnt seem helpful
[10:44:19] <jedimind> thats a lot of "help"
[10:44:27] <jedimind> HEY GUYS THIS GUY NEEDS HELP!
[10:44:31] <pallet> jedimind, yeh ;)
[10:44:33] * jedimind waddles away
[10:45:28] <gnarf> pallet: it helps if you have a specific question
[10:45:36] <gnarf> what have you tried
[10:45:39] <gnarf> what has you stuck
[10:46:33] <MrPunkin> is there a way on an individual xhr request object for its chained fail() method to override the default ajaxError one?
[10:46:35] <pallet> gnarf, basicall the help says. A jQuery object that can be used instead of the '+ add new record' link. Thus you can set any element on the page to open the 'add new record' dialog., but I don't really know how that works
[10:48:16] <gnarf> MrPunkin: not really - global handlers have issues like that
[10:48:43] <pallet> gnarf, do you understand what I mean?
[10:49:09] <Ziggy`> Can I somehow make Backbone use #/ instead of only # for routing?
[10:49:16] <gnarf> pallet: Sounds like you pass it a jQuery selector for your add record button at the initalization
[10:49:20] <Ziggy`> So it'd be mysite.com/#/foo
[10:49:32] <Ziggy`> And mysite.com/foo for people that have html5 browser history.
[10:49:45] <gnarf> Ziggy`: #documentclound
[10:49:50] <gnarf> Ziggy`: #documentcloud
[10:49:53] <gnarf> sorry typo
[10:49:58] <maxmoore14> gnarf: do you have a sec to look at this fiddle? http://jsfiddle.net/AaDfz/1/ I have a problem with _delay
[10:50:04] <gnarf> ^^^ backbone help more likely in that channel
[10:50:11] <Ziggy`> Whoops
[10:50:16] <Ziggy`> Sorry, meant for documentcloud :)
[10:50:27] <gnarf> so um
[10:50:28] <Ziggy`> Getting a bit tired I guess.
[10:50:36] <gnarf> thats not how delay works maxmoore14
[10:50:36] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:50:49] <gnarf> focus: this._delay(this._count),
[10:50:52] <awc737> should I ever bother with callbacks after learning deferreds?
[10:50:54] <gnarf> this._delay returns an int
[10:50:57] <gnarf> so focus is an int
[10:50:59] <gnarf> and it breaks
[10:51:03] <gnarf> you want
[10:51:11] <michaelfillier> I am trying to animate a backgroun-position which I can get with .css('background-position') but the element is currently using "50% 100%" and I want to adjust the 100% using a pixel value. Is there any way to get the current px value from a property %?
[10:51:24] <gnarf> focus: function() { this._delay( this._count ); }
[10:51:33] <maxmoore14> ahhh
[10:51:46] <maxmoore14> thank you!!!!
[10:51:57] <gnarf> yup, np
[10:52:04] <michaelfillier> I can split the .css('background-position') to isolate the values, but trying .css({'background-position':'50% -=10px'}); is not working
[10:53:34] <djQuery> gnarf, +++++
[10:54:22] <gnarf> maxmoore14: been asking that one for a while haven't ya?
[10:54:22] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:54:31] <michaelfillier> how can I alter a % property value by an amount of pixels?
[10:55:03] <maxmoore14> gnarf: lol, yes!
[10:55:11] <michaelfillier> I have a value of 100% and I want to subtract , say, 10px from it. Is there a way to convert the % to its current px value?
[10:55:16] <maxmoore14> all week
[10:55:39] <gnarf> maxmoore14: first time i caught it
[10:55:39] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:55:40] <gnarf> ;)
[10:55:51] <gnarf> AdamPDotty: ?
[10:56:32] <gnarf> maxmoore14: not the issue, cuz i've seen that pasted, but the reason for the bug
[10:56:32] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:56:46] <gnarf> AdamPDotty: can you say anything else?
[10:56:59] <gnarf> or will you just ask about another cow in 30 seconds
[10:57:26] <maxmoore14> gnarf: cool. thanks for taking a look again
[10:58:33] <gnarf> i wonder whats triggering that response... maybe its maxmoore14 's name?
[10:58:34] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:58:34] <michaelfillier> anyone have any idea how to calculate the current px value of a %?
[10:58:35] <gnarf> yup
[10:58:37] <gnarf> maxmoore14:
[10:58:38] <AdamPDotty> okay, who let the cow loose?
[10:59:12] <maxmoore14> that's weird!!
[11:00:12] <gnarf> yeah
[11:00:19] <gnarf> nothing +q can't solve maxmoore14

[11:29:16] <saltcod> Problem is, I cant get scrollTop() to return anything but 0
[11:29:39] <Francis47> can someone tell me the best way to detect IE with jquery?
[11:30:00] <saltcod> $('html').scrollTop();    $('body').scrollTop();   etc all return 0

[11:31:15] <gnarf> djQuery: b-ot learns in the same way
[11:31:20] <gnarf> might wanna make sure to teach em both
[11:31:21] <gnarf> ;)
[11:31:46] <gnarf> although i think with b-ot, when you pm him you still need b-ot: before the command to make it work
[11:32:07] <gnarf> some day i'm just gonna ban bot-t
[11:32:14] <gnarf> and let b-ot take over
[11:32:18] <gnarf> he's way more stable
[11:32:26] <gnarf> (shes?)
[11:32:41] <gnarf> b-ot: are you a male bot or a fem bot?
[11:32:41] <b-ot> gnarf: don’t count on it.
[11:32:54] * gnarf hugs b-ot
[11:32:58] <rmill> !uptime
[11:32:59] <b-ot> rmill: Sober for 21h 4m 4s.
[11:33:04] <rmill> daw
[11:33:10] <rmill> I guess it got a restart recently.
[11:37:01] <chase-work>  isn't a jquery .on event suppose to fire even on dynamically added classes?
[11:38:06] <rmill> chase-work: You have to do it differently.
[11:38:20] <rmill> if you want it to be all LIVEly
[11:38:33] <chase-work> rmill: you don't mean use .live do you?
[11:38:39] <rmill> no, no I don't
[11:38:39] <chase-work> i thought that was deprecated
[11:38:41] <chase-work> ok
[11:38:45] <rmill> yes, yes it is.
[11:38:56] <chase-work> anything you can point to for me to read?
[11:39:13] <rmill> chase-work: http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[11:39:26] <rmill> check the second one
[11:39:28] <chase-work> thanks
[11:40:06] <djQuery> gnarf, but that was so long ago I dont remember what the comands were
[11:40:07] <chase-work> so watch the parent?
[11:40:25] <chase-work> because tried the second one, with $(body) as the parent
[11:41:10] <raj> gnarf, how's your jqui?
[11:41:42] <Francis47> saltcod: Thanks - very helpfull post
[11:41:47] <Raydiation> any idea why the trigger click gives me too much recursion? http://jsfiddle.net/9tQNk/1/
[11:41:50] <gnarf> raj: depends... there's like a 50% chance i've looked at it
[11:42:14] <Raydiation> i see, input click also triggers parent element click
[11:43:10] <rmill> djQuery: You don't remember what the original ones were?
[11:43:25] <rmill> YA NOOB BOOB
[11:44:30] <raj> gnarf, can I pm the link to the live site?
[11:44:49] <gnarf> raj: might help if you ask the question first
[11:44:57] <gnarf> or explain the situation
[11:45:07] <chase-work> rmill: got it, thanks, my order was off
[11:45:12] <raj> the close button in ui-dialog is screwed up ever since I switched to 1.10
[11:45:21] <gnarf> also, i prefer to avoid PM's as i have a tendancy to need to disappear and i want someone else to be able to pick up / learn from what I've said
[11:45:42] <gnarf> raj: "screwed up" --- visual thing?
[11:45:46] <raj> yes
[11:45:48] <raj> it's css issue
[11:45:49] <gnarf> or behavior thing
[11:45:54] <raj> but not sure why 1.10 caused it
[11:45:59] <rmill> chase-work: :D~
[11:46:04] <gnarf> and your inspector isn't giving you any hints?
[11:46:21] <raj> there are margins that i'd have to override
[11:46:26] <raj> but why are those margins there in the first place?
[11:51:58] <gnarf> raj: not sure, i don't mess much with css
[11:52:23] <gnarf> just occasionally hollering at it from across the room, or punching it in the face
[11:53:35] <raj> shoky juice shoky juice shoky juice
[12:10:03] <gotwig> can I send two POST requests with one event in jquery?
[12:14:02] <ctorp> I'm pretty sure that could be handled via one of the status event handlers of ajax
[12:14:16] <ctorp> like "success: yourfn()->"
[12:14:25] <ctorp> if I understand the question correctly
[12:14:48] <gotwig> ctorp, I catch a click event, then I want to execute some code
[12:15:02] <gotwig> ctorp, can I input multiple selectors, for the code that comes after it?
[12:15:23] <gotwig> ctorp, like catching a blur event from somewhere, and a click event, from another thing
[12:15:28] <gotwig> and executing the same code
[12:15:31] <ctorp> you have an example somewhere?
[12:15:48] <ctorp> having trouble visualizing with the amt of brainpower I have available atm
[12:16:28] <ionas> aproduct.delay(10000).append('<div class="loading_XHR"></div>') … the delay is not working  here
[12:16:36] <gotwig> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1653320/
[12:16:37] <gotwig> see?
[12:16:38] <ionas> $('selector').delay(1000).append()
[12:17:39] <gotwig> oh damn thats the wrong code..
[12:17:40] <gnarf> ionas: that will never work ionas
[12:17:41] <gotwig> for the second one
[12:17:48] <gnarf> delay is not a replacement for setTimeout
[12:17:51] <gnarf> just use setTimeout
[12:17:59] <gnarf> .delay() works with animation functions
[12:18:04] <ionas> okay
[12:18:13] <ionas> can i chain it like
[12:18:33] <ionas> aproduct.append().hide().delay().fadeIn()?
[12:19:02] <gnarf> no
[12:19:06] <gnarf> well kinda
[12:19:07] <gnarf> i guess
[12:19:08] <gotwig> ctorp, http://paste.ubuntu.com/1653328/
[12:19:10] <gnarf> since fadeIn is animation
[12:19:29] <gotwig> ctorp, I want to execute the draggable code, only the post request: 					$.post('save_position.php', {data: this.serialize()}, function(ret) {
[12:19:29] <gotwig> 						//your callback
[12:19:29] <gotwig> 					});
[12:21:54] <gotwig> can I use that here http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/ two times for one event?
[12:22:34] <gotwig> yeah
[12:22:48] <gotwig> that is the solution I guess! as its a method
[12:22:50] <ionas> gnarf: yes it works: aproduct.prepend('<div class="loading_XHR"></div>'); \ $('.loading_XHR').hide().delay(300).fadeIn(200);
[12:23:04] <ionas> gnarf: i don't like to show a spinning wheel if the client/server is fast anyway
[12:23:21] <shoky> raj jews raj jews raj jews
[12:29:51] <gotwig> How to fix that here? http://paste.ubuntu.com/1653374/
[12:30:03] <gotwig> two ajax requests for one event
[12:31:47] <jklaus> hey all
[12:31:50] <gotwig> Unexpected token }
[12:32:25] <jklaus> Does jquery $('#ID[checked]') search for where the attribute 'checked' exists or where the property 'checked' returns true?
[12:32:40] <shoky> gotwig: remove the semicolon in line 19
[12:33:07] <gotwig> should my code work in theory?
[12:33:31] <shoky> for sending 2 seperate requests? i guess..
[12:33:46] <shoky> extra comma on line 14 also
[12:34:07] <gotwig> Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of input
[12:34:22] <shoky> that doesn't help without seeing the code.
[12:35:16] <gotwig> http://paste.ubuntu.com/1653399/
[12:35:34] <gotwig> or do I have to put data in data...?
[12:35:48] <gotwig> data: { data: drister.serialize() }
[12:36:16] <shalotelli> jklaus $("#ID").is(":checked") which would tell you if the element is checked or not, $("#ID[checked
[12:36:17] <shoky> no idea what gridster is..
[12:36:42] <shalotelli> ] would be valid if the checked property exists
[12:36:50] <shalotelli> i think?
[12:37:34] <gotwig> now it work
[12:37:45] <gotwig> meaning I dont get javascript errors
[12:37:49] <gotwig> but, it doesnt work
[12:37:57] <jklaus> shalotelli, I'm looking for a way to return an array of inputs that are not checked.. I know I could easily run a fuction with .each and return an array of the none checked but was curious if there was a single line jq statement that'd do it.
[12:37:58] <shoky> go fix it, stop telling us about it
[12:39:06] <gotwig> it doesnt work, it blocks after the first ajax
[12:39:07] <gotwig> get it
[12:39:08] <gotwig> ...
[12:39:41] <shoky> jklaus:  $(':checkbox:not(:checked)')
[12:39:55] <kripster> hey guys, just looking for a bit of advice, is my positioning of my make label and dropdown correct? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/28/
[12:39:56] <jklaus> shoky thank you!
[12:40:17] <kripster> using top or is there a better way to position on forms? thanks
[12:40:41] <shalotelli> n then u could use the map function to do what u want to do with the elements
[12:40:51] <shalotelli> jklaus
[12:40:59] <shalotelli> shoky u beat me to it lol
[12:41:42] <jklaus> not sure why i forgot about :not .. lol
[12:41:45] <djQuery> shoky, does fiddle still read from right to left?
[12:41:52] <jklaus> not enough coffee perhaps
[12:41:54] <shoky> sizzle?
[12:42:00] <djQuery> yeah that one
[12:42:14] <shoky> ;] donno really
[12:42:53] <gotwig> http://baris.aydinoglu.info/javascript/multiple-ajax-request-with-jquery-when
[12:42:57] <gotwig> does that help me?
[12:43:07] <shoky> gotwig: maybe
[12:43:21] <kripster> is that the best way to position buttons, labels, etc?? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/28/
[12:43:42] <shoky> gotwig: do you want to send the requests in parallel , or one after another?
[12:43:53] <gotwig> shoky, I don't care
[12:44:17] <shoky> then $.ajax(...);  $.ajax(...);  should be fine. assuming you dont use async:false
[12:44:37] <gotwig> see it isnt enough.
[12:44:45] <shoky> what do you mean, it's blocking..?
[12:44:52] <gotwig> it doesnt send the second
[12:44:58] <gotwig> I don't get any javascript error message
[12:45:03] <shoky> it doesnt send the second, ever?
[12:45:41] <gotwig> shoky, yes, it doesn't
[12:45:50] <gotwig> when I place methods after the second, javascript execute these.
[12:46:03] <gotwig> I look now into the developer tools
[12:46:06] <gotwig> *network*
[12:46:32] <gotwig> I am wrong
[12:46:34] <gotwig> it does send something
[12:46:57] <gotwig> Warning: Invalid argument supplied for foreach() in /users/bbm3h11bgo/www/project/save_position.php on line 5
[12:46:58] <gotwig> ah..
[12:48:10] <gotwig> my athe line that I want to *convert* into .ajax is the following: $.post('save_position.php', {data: this.serialize()}, function(ret) {});
[12:49:06] <shoky> then you'd want:   data: {data: this.serialize()}    or something
[12:49:19] <shoky> for $.ajax({...})
[12:49:29] <gotwig> shoky, I did that directly, without {
[12:49:39] <gotwig> shoky, so I have to write data two times?
[12:49:43] <kripster> should i use top:**px for positioning labels, buttons etc??
[12:49:56] <Gho5t> no
[12:50:21] <shoky> gotwig: yeah. once for specifying that this is the data for $.ajax. and the 2nd time for your php script that i assume is expecting a 'data' parameter
[12:51:43] <gotwig> it still doesn't work, but now I don't get error replies in the developer tools
[12:52:01] <kripster> Gho5t:so what should i use for positioning?
[12:52:15] <Gho5t> everything else
[12:52:28] <Gho5t> margins, floating, blah blah
[12:53:17] <kripster> cheers of the blah blah, quality stuff
[12:54:42] <Gho5t> abs positioning has a few use cases
[12:54:46] <Gho5t> you don't use it for everything
[12:54:57] <Gho5t> simply because it takes the elements out of the document's flow
[12:56:24] <kripster> Gho5t: cheers
[12:57:25] <gotwig> I stop that now
[12:57:28] <gotwig> way too complex..
[13:06:48] <gotwig> I am so depressed, guys...
[13:08:20] <Jester86> thats.. depressing..
[13:11:27] <gotwig> I don't know whats going on :/
[13:11:41] <kripster> now i'm depressed
[13:11:57] <gotwig> yeah
[13:12:03] <gotwig> valentines day...
[13:14:12] <NoiseEee> you mean 'proud to be single day'
[13:17:13] <gotwig> die(); not found
[13:17:17] <gotwig> damn, that is PHp
[13:18:07] <gotwig> like I don't know what the hell is going on :(
[13:18:27] * gotwig cries like a little kid
[13:23:39] <Gho5t> how old are you guy
[13:23:43] <Gho5t> there's still time
[13:26:35] <kripster> simple question, why does both of these text fields not line up if the margin-left are both the same? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/35/
[13:28:29] <Gho5t> because the text to the left of each is not the same width
[13:29:42] <kripster> Gho5t: so when I say margin-left is that taking it from the edge of the text??
[13:30:02] <Gho5t> you got it
[13:30:23] <spyderman4g63> well there is another issue
[13:30:25] <kripster> grrr, so if i want margin-left from edge of form what do i use?
[13:30:33] <spyderman4g63> the input for VRM is inside the label
[13:30:49] <spyderman4g63> put it outside
[13:31:14] <Gho5t> or put them both inside
[13:31:19] <spyderman4g63> right
[13:33:08] <kripster> ok have put the vrm label outside, so both are now outside, so how do i position the text box to line up with each other, as Gho5t says if i do what i am currentl doing i would have to manually work out margin-left from length of text, is there a standard way to start from edge so length of label is not an issue?
[13:36:40] <kripster> sorry that was quite a big sentence, any ideas guys?
[13:42:02] <spyderman4g63> i don't know if there is a standard way
[13:43:42] <NoiseEee> kripster: basically #css
[13:43:59] <NoiseEee> kripster: seems you'd be interested in actually setting a specific width for your <label>s
[13:44:05] <shader> how would you get the word right before element that you already have selected?
[13:44:26] <spyderman4g63> right, but then your labels need to be displayed as inline-block elements
[13:45:20] <shader> i.e. keyword<span class='help'>?</span> and have the hover event for the help class make use of the keyword
[13:46:39] <Raydiation> how does is(':visible') work? does the elmeent have to be in the DOM=
[13:47:32] <kripster> spyderman4g63:confused? lol
[13:48:06] <NoiseEee> Raydiation: uh yeah
[13:48:11] <Raydiation> ty
[13:48:38] <Raydiation> what about clicks?
[13:48:51] <Raydiation> when i trigger a click on an element that isnt in the DOM, will it execute?
[13:49:22] <Raydiation> im asking because im writing unittests
[13:50:58] <NoiseEee> as in: var p = $('<div>',{id:'doggy'});   p.click(); ?
[13:51:15] <NoiseEee> i suppose you can do up a fiddle easily enough ;)
[13:52:20] <NoiseEee> http://jsfiddle.net/ZGJfH/ no DOM necessary
[13:52:44] <spyderman4g63> kripster, you've found a jsfiddle issue I think
[13:57:05] <rmill> spyderman4g63: jsfiddle has been pretty broken the last little while
[13:57:13] <rmill> If you are having issues I suggest using codepen.io
[13:57:23] <spyderman4g63> i don't use it much
[13:57:30] <spyderman4g63> thanks for the heads up though
[13:57:43] <rmill> well, kripster, or whatever :D
[13:57:53] <rmill> WHOMEVER IS HAVING ISSUES
[13:58:28] <spyderman4g63> LOUD NOISES

[14:08:58] <socialcloud_> hey guys really struggling with this, error for page: http://pastebin.com/uHSNnZ54 .  js file in question: http://pastebin.com/cqPcw18n
[14:09:39] <socialcloud_> as an incentive to one who could help, I will be opening linode account soon, and if you happen to be affiliate I dont mind using your link :)
[14:10:01] <Deemer> anyone familiar with jquery with SharePoint?
[14:16:58] <socialcloud_> should be fairly straight forward thing, the slider shows up on www.peoplenotary.com page and then hides itself. thats the issue
[14:33:15] <grafi> man cors is driving me crazy -.-
[14:35:57] <kripster> any ideas why this is now failing ? http://jsfiddle.net/khtvS/47/
[14:39:08] <kripster> anyone chatting in here?
[14:39:39] <jedimind> nope
[14:39:40] <Ziggy`> 884 people, but it's rather quiet.
[14:39:41] <jedimind> just you
[14:42:40] <kripster> just me myself and I
[14:46:18] <relipse> how do i access an element named "name", form.name wouldn't work
[14:47:25] <spyderman4g63> is it a name attribute or a class?
[14:48:15] <spyderman4g63> like $('name="thename"')  ?
[14:49:22] <systemfault> o_O
[14:54:50] <spyderman4g63> relipse $('form[name="name"]')
[15:00:16] <kaylee> anyone happen to have experience with using qtip?
[15:01:09] <coldhead> sure, east side represent
[15:01:12] <coldhead> can i kick it, etc
[15:01:39] <kaylee> I've got the tip dynamically populating the content with an ajax call, successfully… but what's returned happens to also contain a form, and I'm having difficulty being able to submit that form and actually staying on the same page
[15:02:41] <kaylee> suggestions on dealing with that would be super helpful
[15:06:39] <shoky> kaylee an actual question would be helpful
[15:07:05] <shoky> some code to accompany it would be lovely too
[15:08:44] <janthony> Is there a simple function that will reset a form on submit? I don't think .reset() works anymore, getting not a function.
[15:10:50] <shoky> janthony:  try  this.reset() instead of $(this).reset()
[15:11:37] <janthony> shoky: I'm actually var thisForm = $(this), and passing thisForm.reset(); into my ajax callback. so change $(this) to this?
[15:12:08] <shoky> thisForm[0].reset()
[15:12:12] <rmill> .reset() isn't going to do anything on a jQuery object
[15:12:55] <janthony> Worked. Thanks!
[15:13:41] <rmill> .get(0).reset() will also do the trick
[15:14:04] <rmill> ?api .get
[15:14:04] <b-ot> rmill: No matches.
[15:14:05] <janthony> Roger. Thanks again. On that note. Time to pack up and take the Fiance to valentines day… grrr
[15:14:11] <rmill> ?api get
[15:14:11] <b-ot> rmill: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[15:21:48] <mikehaas763> Why would I be getting a OPTIONS 404 error when calling a remote url with .ajax()? I setup CORS on the server
[15:23:53] <mikehaas763> Can jquery be used with cors
[15:25:43] <SMaction> I have posted 2 versions of the same function at http://pastebin.com/jPJ7Mq5U the first version had an error: the y instead of y ycaused the year to always be 2020.  That is corrected in the second version. However, when using the first version  var nights = diff/1000/60/60/24; was sometimes not an integer.  How is that possible?  Does it have something to do with 2020 being a leap year?  Is
[15:25:43] <SMaction> there something in the jquery datepicker?
[15:28:35] <shoky> mikehaas763: yes. sounds like a 404
[15:29:03] <mikehaas763> shoky, i said it's a 404
[15:29:04] <mikehaas763> lol
[15:29:35] <shoky> mikehaas763: so i guess that's what your server is responding with.. and.. that's why ;p
[15:29:57] <mikehaas763> I see
[15:41:43] <deo> hello!
[15:41:52] <deo> can somebody help me out with my script?

[16:13:10] <is_null> hi all, what's the best way to mock $.ajax for unit tests ?
[16:14:28] <StephenS> tipsy or tooltip ui?
[16:38:02] <ipsifendus> there seems to be an issue when a radio .buttonset() only has two radios? has anyone ran across this? http://jsfiddle.net/edwardsharp/JME7x/
[16:39:54] <coldhead> the issue is with your radios not having names http://jsfiddle.net/JME7x/1/
[16:40:10] <coldhead> the same thing happens native radios, sans UI
[16:42:16] <ipsifendus> booyah, of course, thx!
[16:44:24] <Raydiation> is there a way to check with jquery if a slideup event is performed?
[16:44:50] <Raydiation> or an animation is started on an element
[16:45:00] <gadlol> Hello. I do this $(this).parent().parent().parent() is it possible to do something like $(this).parent(3) instead?
[16:48:58] <systemfault> gadlol: Forget .parent() exists
[16:49:07] <systemfault> Use .closest('selector here')
[16:50:14] <gadlol> yeah nice
[16:50:22] <gadlol> thanx
[16:55:40] <Raydiation> using jasmine how would i test if a div has been slid down?
[16:56:27] <coldhead> .is(':animated')
[16:56:43] <Raydiation> well its async right?
[16:56:43] <coldhead> .is(':visible')
[16:57:20] <coldhead> .slideDown(function () { $(this).addClass('opened'); }
[16:57:29] <coldhead> .is(':aniamted, .opened')
[16:58:57] <Raydiation> got it: $.fx.off = true
[16:59:37] <coldhead> great work
[17:00:49] <Raydiation> hm, still seems to be async :/
[17:01:51] <coldhead> Raydiation: https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/jasmine-js/29xa0cFRQyI
[17:02:03] <coldhead> https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/bscamp/QXNJIADxy9A
[17:02:27] <Raydiation> yeah, got the second link, but unfortunately doesnt work :)
[17:04:01] <coldhead> :(
[17:04:20] <StephenS> Woh eat good in here?
[17:04:55] <coldhead> i eat good club sandwich
[17:11:20] * socialcloud_ solved woohoo!
[17:13:39] <Ziber> With a .click() event, I want to get the x and y coordinates as to where, exactly a user clicked. Is there a way to do this?
[17:13:53] <Trudko_> guys for whatever reason widgets does not work for this one table and this one table only in my app http://jsbin.com/awiniw/1/edit
[17:14:04] <Trudko_> sorting is working but widgets doe snot affects it
[17:16:55] <shoky> Ziber: .click(function(event){ ... event.pageX, event.pageY ... })
[17:17:17] <Ziber> thanks!
[17:17:43] <rmill> Ziber: http://jsfiddle.net/UaDBh/
[17:17:52] <rmill> ↑ Something like that
[17:17:54] * rmill shrugs
[17:17:54] <b-ot> rmill: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[17:18:21] <Jarlund> People awake in here?
[17:18:31] <tbmiller> is there any technique in jquery that allows you to 'trigger' an action/event whenever there is an existance of another class dynamically occurs through jquery as well?
[17:18:32] <rmill> Ziber: don't need that .offset, lol
[17:18:36] <rmill> http://jsfiddle.net/UaDBh/1/
[17:18:56] <rmill> ?api trigger @ tbmiller
[17:18:56] <b-ot> tbmiller: .trigger(): Execute all handlers and behaviors attached to the matched elements for the given event type. http://api.jquery.com/trigger/
[17:19:02] <Jarlund> Is anybody able to spot the error in my code? http://pastebin.com/sr12wcNN - It's working if I include the highlighted code in a stand alone example.. I really don't get it. Example page can be found here: http://blaastjernevej.dk/elektronikportalen/index.php?page=item&id=3
[17:24:13] <tbmiller> thants rmill and b-ot, but what I want to trigger to work with doesn't happen through an event like a mouse click or a mouse over. Imagine I have something like a slideshow. I would something like an indicator (e.g. text change color) to show that I have other elements living within a <section> but I only want that event to happen when there is an existence of two classes, one of which is already being dynamically added
[17:24:29] <tbmiller> I'm hoping that makes some sense
[17:26:53] <rmill> wat ಠ_ಠ
[17:27:13] <rmill> tbmiller: I don't really follow, no.
[17:27:36] <ecurtis> Hi, I have a question about an example JS here http://flexslider.woothemes.com/dynamic-carousel-min-max.html
[17:28:06] <ecurtis> specificlly the opening var declaration and what flexslider is refering to
[17:28:46] <ecurtis> is it the class flexslider or the flexslider object, and what would happen if you had 2 sliders on the page. cheers
[17:30:02] <rmill> tbmiller: You can check for classes in your event handler
[17:30:07] <rmill> ?api hasclass tbmiller
[17:30:08] <Jarlund> Why is fancybox not working!!!! http://pastebin.com/sr12wcNN  - http://blaastjernevej.dk/elektronikportalen/index.php?page=item&id=3
[17:30:15] <rmill> ?api hasclass @ tbmiller
[17:30:15] <b-ot> tbmiller: .hasClass(): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[17:30:21] <rmill> Not sure if that's what you want, thoguh
[17:30:24] <rmill> *though
[17:32:07] <tbmiller> @rmill something like that, but the trouble that I'm having is adding the class that I want detected ONLY when I am on the current "slide" and then triggering it only in that instance
[17:32:42] <rmill> tbmiller: are you using a plugin for your "slideshow"?
[17:32:58] <rmill> May I suggest Malsup's jQuery cycle?
[17:33:07] <rmill> ?g malsup cycle
[17:33:07] <b-ot> rmill: JQuery Cycle Plugin - jQuery Plugins by malsup → http://jquery.malsup.com/cycle/
[17:33:49] <tbmiller> not really. I'm usinng reveal.js and my 'slides' are actually images nested in <sections>
[17:42:08] <rmill> tbmiller: cycle is handy, because it has methods that fire after it transitions to the next slide
[17:42:16] <rmill> reveal might have something too…?
[17:43:06] <rmill> tbmiller: Is this a presentation?
[17:46:20] <nesoi> hey so in jquery can I just add random parameters to an element and then reference them? Like can I have <a myparam="mydata" > and then on a click event to this.myparam ?
[17:46:29] <nesoi> do, not to
[17:47:16] <nesoi> or I guess data-myparam would be better
[17:48:01] <rmill> Ya
[17:48:05] <rmill> use data attrs
[17:48:07] <rmill> and then
[17:48:12] <rmill> ?api data
[17:48:12] <b-ot> rmill: .data(): Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/data/
[17:48:41] <_SjG_> am I mistaken in thinking $('tr td:eq(2)') should select TDs in the third column of a table (assuming a single table in this example)?
[17:49:00] <nesoi> thanks rmill
[17:49:46] <rmill> _SjG_: cols are the tr's
[17:49:48] <tbmiller> *rmill* In that case cycle might help. I'll look into it. Yes it's a presentation, but with a little more functionalilty like sharing the URL of where it will be hosted
[17:50:02] <rmill> so: `tr:eq(2) td`
[17:50:58] <rmill> er, wait, not I'm confused
[17:50:59] <_SjG_> rmill: wouldn't that give me all of the TDs in the 3rd row?
[17:51:02] <rmill> How do tables work again?
[17:51:06] <_SjG_> :)
[17:51:07] <rmill> Ya
[17:51:35] <rmill> Yours SHOULD work, then.
[17:51:49] <Ziber> I want to get the X/Y coordinates relative to the elements I'm clicking, not to the whole page. How would I do that?
[17:51:50] <Trudko_> guys for whatever reason widgets does not work for this one table and this one table only in my app http://jsbin.com/awiniw/1/edit]
[17:51:52] <Trudko_> sorting is working but widgets doe snot affects it
[17:51:58] <_SjG_> hm I must be doing something stupid, cause I'm getting a single TD back :/
[17:54:25] <rmill> _SjG_: Ya, I think you need to call .find
[17:54:30] <rmill> and do it on all TR's
[17:54:32] <rmill> ala: http://jsfiddle.net/R34Db/
[17:54:40] <_SjG_> ok. thanks.
[17:55:29] <_SjG_> cool, it works.
[17:55:31] <_SjG_> :)
[17:57:00] <jrockjiggz> rmill: same thing.. using :th-child() http://jsfiddle.net/R34Db/1/
[18:00:05] <rmill> jrockjiggz: AH YES
[18:00:10] * rmill forgot
[18:00:35] <jrockjiggz> i personally prefer eq(2) though.. seems easier to use
[18:01:03] <rmill> Ya, it'd be interesting to see which method is quicker, but meh
[18:06:22] <coldhead> OPEN ARE THE DOUBLE DOORS OF THE HORIZON. UNLOCKED ARE ITS VAULTS.
[18:06:51] <danheberden> coldhead: well what the fuck am i doing to do with this key then
[18:31:45] <narkeeso> so i'm trying to avoid using setTimeout to wait for an element to hit the DOM, what's the best way to listen/wait for the element to hit before executing function(s)
[18:46:19] <Jarlund> When using a older version of jQuery fancybox works, but Bootstrap wont. When using the newest version of jQuery Boostrap works, but fancybox does not. Any idea what the problem might be?
[18:48:37] <coldhead> some kind of version conflict i expect
[18:49:02] <coldhead> do you need to use fancybox? can't you use the modal that comes with bootstrap?
[18:50:00] <nesoi> so I've used the jquery inArray function, but what if you want to determine whether some value is in myarray[...].whatever. is there a good way to do that, other than
[18:50:21] <nesoi> for (var i=0; i<myarray.length; ++i){if (myarray.whatever === value{wefoundit = true; break;}}
[18:52:03] <systemfault> .indexOf?
[18:52:20] <systemfault> ?js [1,2,3,4,5].indexOf(4);
[18:52:25] <shoky> nesoi: $.grep
[18:53:03] <systemfault> Hmm, right.. .indexOf isn't supported on older browsers :(
[18:56:44] <shoky> ok im bored
[18:58:31] <nesoi> shoky : $.grep hmm
[18:58:53] <coldhead> older browsers can go to hell
[18:59:00] <coldhead> what have they done for us lately anyway
[18:59:48] <nesoi> shoky : I don
[19:00:06] <nesoi> 't think that will work because value could be in another property too, but I need to know only if it's in a given property
[19:15:40] <xp_prg> hi all I am getting the error $ is undefined
[19:15:49] <xp_prg> any ideas what I am doing wrong?
[19:18:00] <shoky> nesoi: donno what you mean
[19:19:16] <nesoi> shoky : if I'm looking to see if 123 is in myarray.prop1 anywhere, it could also be in myarray.prop2
[19:19:23] <nesoi> I think the grep would find it in both places
[19:19:32] <nesoi> but I only care if it's in prop1
[19:19:58] <shoky> is it an array or an object..?
[19:20:37] <shoky> i meant:   var wefoundit = $.grep(myarray,function(el){ return el.whatever === value }).length > 0;
[19:21:13] <shoky> and yea it's more wasteful than a loop that breaks
[19:21:34] <nesoi> hm... in #javascript they suggested .some
[19:21:37] <nesoi> function inAny(a, prop,v) { return a.some(function (each) { return each[prop] === v }) }
[19:21:41] <shoky> that's not jquery
[19:21:58] <nesoi> true, but it would work since it's javascript
[19:22:12] <nesoi> just not sure if it would work on the platforms I care about
[19:22:22] <shoky> tru. no IE<9 though
[19:22:35] <nesoi> I'm doing android/iphone
[19:23:13] <shoky> no idea.
[19:31:40] <nathanbz> using jqueryui tabs how do I numericly select the 4th tab
[19:37:23] <nesoi> shoky : a good reason to use jquery functions cuz they should definitely work
[19:52:09] <Jarlund> Somebody help me! If I use a jQuery version newer than 1.7.2 my google maps and fancybox stops working on http://blaastjernevej.dk/elektronikportalen/index.php?page=item&id=3. But if I use version 1.7.2 or older Bootstrap wont work on my website. And what I really can't seem to understand is that if I use fancybox alone in a example, it has no problem with jQuery 1.9.1 ...
[19:52:21] <xp_prg> I am confused by $(document) and just $() when is document needed?
[19:52:55] <xp_prg> is there a jquery mobile channel just curious?
[19:53:19] <coldhead> not anymore
[19:53:23] <coldhead> you're standing in it
[19:53:31] <Jarlund> and to add here is a pastebin of my code: http://pastebin.com/4ajc2sNN
[19:53:37] <coldhead> those two forms of document ready are equivalent, xp_prg
[19:53:42] <coldhead> the first is more readable
[19:54:29] <xp_prg> must I use jquery mobile for any reason, I don't understand if it is required or if jquery proper is enough
[19:55:04] <coldhead> you use jquery mobile if you like the look of the jquery mobile demo and want your code to look/act like that
[19:55:16] <coldhead> you can use jquery on mobile devices without jquery mobile
[19:55:22] <xp_prg> but must I use it or can I just stick with jquery?
[19:55:26] <xp_prg> oh ok good
[19:57:49] <coldhead> Jarlund: i am seeing errors relating to $.browser which was removed from jquery in 1.9
[19:57:55] <coldhead> if you use 1.8 it should still work
[19:58:09] <coldhead> because 1.8 still has $.browser
[19:58:34] <Jarlund> coldhead is that the map causing the conflict?
[19:59:02] <coldhead> i don't know man, i am just telling you i am seeing errors relating to $.browser
[19:59:14] <coldhead> i doubt google maps relies on $,browser
[19:59:19] <coldhead> i am pretty sure fancybox does
[19:59:59] <Jarlund> oh, but what's weird is that fancybox is infact working if I run a test apart from my website.
[20:00:26] <xp_prg> coldhead I am using phonegap and no matter what I do I get this error $ is undefined
[20:03:07] <coldhead> xp_prg: try using jQuery instead of $
[20:03:10] <coldhead> see if that works
[20:03:16] <coldhead> if not then jQuery is not included
[20:03:42] <xp_prg> ok
[20:07:54] <xp_prg>  jQuery(document).ready( function() {
[20:07:59] <xp_prg> is that the right syntax?
[20:09:57] <tw2113> yes
[20:10:09] <tw2113> at least for the first half
[20:10:16] <tw2113> don't forget the });
[20:11:14] <coldhead> xp_prg: you can even try just jQuery('body').html( jQuery.fn.jquery )
[20:11:28] <coldhead> inside the .ready() or at the bottom of your page
[20:11:29] <tw2113> he's just guessing, he's new
[20:11:38] <tw2113> but he could be right
[20:11:40] <xp_prg> ok coldhead
[20:13:47] <CmdX> I'm trying to write a plugin that simplifies ajax calls to insert data into a database. so instead of $.ajax({}) it's just $.insertdata({}) $.updatedata({}) - is there a good example of a best practice of handling this type of thing?
[20:18:01] <lenswipee_> $title = jQuery(this).find('title:first'); <-- correct to get title attribute in img?
[20:20:01] <lenswipee_> <img src="" title="" alt="">
[20:20:02] <xp_prg> I am soooo dumb
[20:20:02] <lenswipee_> FYI
[20:20:02] <xp_prg> please don't look at me
[20:20:03] <xp_prg> if you look at me I will be too embarassed to be alive
[20:20:10] <tw2113> lenswipee_, i think that would look for dom elements of "title" not the attributes
[20:21:36] <tw2113> *looks at xp_prg*
[20:21:36] * xp_prg dies
[20:22:12] <momomomomo> hmm I'm having trouble with a query call - I'm trying to change a near-by input text field's value to 'DELETE' upon clicking a nearby button. This method works well for another, similar, call, but doesn't seem to work for this application https://gist.github.com/momer/4958568
[20:23:51] * coldhead glares at xp_prg 
[20:25:13] <tw2113> stop looking at a carcas coldhead
[20:25:14] <nesoi> so in jquery what's a good way to do something like this:
[20:25:46] <nesoi> user clicks on an entry in a contacts list. If the contact has only 1 phone number, highlight it, if more than one, display a popup or page allowing the user to select one phone number, and then go back to where you were (highlighting the contact and retaining all other context)
[20:26:00] <nesoi> how would I do that?
[20:29:57] <nesoi> oops bbl
[20:37:49] <momomomomo> Afternoon all - I'm having some weird trouble with a query selector
[20:38:13] <momomomomo> in Firefox console, $('.fte-field') finds my input with that class
[20:38:46] <momomomomo> and so does $('.remove') find its opposite class - however, $('.remove').closest('.fte-field') doesn't find anything
[20:40:23] <Wolfed> Hey guys. I am trying to get all selected value on all the dropdown boxes available on my site to then pass it as a json array for php to handle them, however I can't seem to get it right, I only get the first item selected and the rest is simply ignored: http://jsfiddle.net/gksDV/2/
[20:40:30] <Wolfed> Any suggestions are welcome
[20:41:13] <coldhead> momomomomo: can we see the HTML this relates to?
[20:41:19] <momomomomo> definitely
[20:41:19] <coldhead> maybe closest() isn't the thing you want
[20:42:39] <momomomomo> hmm - i'm having a hard time pulling the html out
[20:42:45] <momomomomo> (it's autogen through Rails)
[20:43:07] <coldhead> view source copy paste?
[20:43:09] <tw2113> inspector tools perhaps
[20:43:24] <dcherman> Wolfed: you have two elements with the same ID - that's not valid.  IDs should be unique
[20:43:24] <DTrejo> anyone know how to get an accurate height of a flex box'd element?
[20:43:29] <coldhead> god i am so bored/drunk
[20:44:09] <tw2113> go make a twitter jQuery plugin coldhead
[20:44:39] <Wolfed> Seriously?
[20:44:46] <Wolfed> Alrighty, give me a sec.
[20:44:48] <momomomomo> coldhead: it's not appearing in there :O
[20:45:09] <tw2113> your chrome inspector then momomomomo
[20:45:33] <coldhead> do whatever tw2113 says, the dude knows what's going on
[20:45:34] <DTrejo> coldhead: you encouraged me to make this like 3 years ago! nice job for still being around :) http://dtrejo.com/qlock/qlock.html
[20:45:46] <tw2113> only on the 8th day of the week
[20:46:49] <coldhead> this is very handsome, DTrejo
[20:47:14] <DTrejo> thank you, totally ripped from http://www.qlocktwo.com/?lang=en
[20:47:26] <coldhead> ah i vaguely remember
[20:47:36] <DTrejo> been a longgg time
[20:47:51] <coldhead> it seems like only yesterday
[20:47:56] <coldhead> if yesterday was like 10 years long
[20:47:56] <DTrejo> happen to have any experience with flex box height/width access from javascript?
[20:47:59] <coldhead> which i think it was
[20:48:01] <DTrejo> lol
[20:48:12] <coldhead> oh no, i'm not allowed to use flexbox yet i'm sorry
[20:48:22] <coldhead> too "modern"
[20:48:38] <DTrejo> ooh
[20:48:57] <DTrejo> im trying to make a fluid-ish layout for a color picking app
[20:49:01] <DTrejo> colorslice.dtrejo.com
[20:49:04] <DTrejo> try it out
[20:49:48] <coldhead> wow that's cool
[20:49:57] <coldhead> i might steal this for the class i am teaching <3
[20:50:02] <coldhead> SO DON'T BREAK IT
[20:50:16] <DTrejo> hehe I won't
[20:50:17] <DTrejo> enjoy
[20:50:21] <DTrejo> did you try changing the hex values?
[20:50:25] <DTrejo> or hsl
[20:50:27] <DTrejo> or rgb
[20:50:41] <coldhead> it's a rainbow of color options
[20:50:50] <DTrejo> i need to make it more obviously editable, and also more easily copy-pasteable
[20:50:51] <coldhead> like a woman's love
[20:50:57] <DTrejo> yes exactly
[20:51:00] <DTrejo> or  a mans
[20:53:27] <coldhead> sure, i guess so
[20:53:42] <DTrejo> lol
[20:53:52] <DTrejo> wine? beer?
[20:53:54] <momomomomo> coldhead: tw2113 thank you for waiting - https://gist.github.com/momer/4958643
[20:54:56] <momomomomo> I removed the contents (lots of sheize from rails output)
[20:55:11] <Jaredcheeda> is there an easy way to link to page using JQueryUI accordian so that the url would cause a specific section to be displayed. Like on this page, if you wanted "section 2" to be opened by default http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[20:55:32] <coldhead> momomomomo: $('.remove').closest('.fte-field') will find the first ancestor with class fte-field of the element with the class remove
[20:55:39] <coldhead> but i don't see anything with class="remove"
[20:56:12] <momomomomo> coldhead: the <a> tag in the last element should have that
[20:56:28] <momomomomo> oh weird
[20:56:29] <momomomomo> nevermind
[20:56:31] <Wolfed> Alright so that turned into: http://jsfiddle.net/gksDV/3/ and its not working at all now :\
[20:56:40] <coldhead> it has class="remove_fte_fields"
[20:57:15] <momomomomo> how did you discover that '.remove' would work?
[20:57:52] <DTrejo> coldhead: OMG window.getComputedStyle($(canvas).first()[0]).height
[20:58:00] <DTrejo> etc
[20:58:11] <coldhead> DTrejo: oh right! good work
[20:58:36] <coldhead> momomomomo: you told me what your code was and that it wasn't working... so i looked at the HTML to see if i thought it should work
[20:58:44] <coldhead> and decided it shouldn't
[20:58:47] <coldhead> no actual testing
[20:59:10] * tw2113 suspects coldhead mentally controls every single instance of the jQuery library
[20:59:31] <momomomomo> ah
[20:59:43] <momomomomo> well, my js code is here:
[21:00:14] <momomomomo> https://gist.github.com/momer/4958643 updated the gist coldhead
[21:01:21] <tw2113> momomomomo, still looks like it's searching descendents instead of siblings
[21:01:42] <tw2113> well, really items on itself actually
[21:01:54] <tw2113> something like that
[21:01:55] <Jaredcheeda> Is there an easy way to link to a page using a "JQuery UI accordion" so that a specific part of the accordion would be displayed by default. For instance, if you wanted "section 2" to be opened by default on this page: http://jqueryui.com/accordion/  - but only when linked to from a page referencing section two
[21:02:20] <coldhead> you might want instead something like $(this).closest('.inline').prevAll(':has(.fte-field):first').find('.fte-field')
[21:02:29] <coldhead> which is a bit gross
[21:02:52] <momomomomo> right, but I don't have id's that I can work with - unless I can pass them from rails
[21:03:03] <momomomomo> and also, thank you both tw2113 & coldhead  for taking the tiem
[21:03:18] <coldhead> i'm not using IDs, momomomomo, the code i have there should work for your HTML
[21:03:38] <momomomomo> coldhead: oh for sure, just saying if we wanted to clean it up a bit to eliminate the 'grossness'
[21:03:40] <momomomomo> :)

[21:04:19] <Jaredcheeda> coldhead you mother fucking genius
[21:04:34] <coldhead> it's all google baby
[21:05:11] <Jaredcheeda> yeah but your fingers are smarter at typing
[21:05:34] <momomomomo> coldhead: no dice on the script :/
[21:06:24] <momomomomo> coldhead: wait - i take that back one second
[21:08:14] <momomomomo> coldhead: you are indeed incredible
[21:10:11] <Jaredcheeda> goodbye momo http://i.imgur.com/oBPNn45.png
[21:10:37] <coldhead> saddest eyes
[21:12:02] <coder7of9> i am using the numeric plugin. i have a predefined onchange handler on the input which i would like to trigger fron within this plugin. i could put it in blur but that is not optimal. how can i add it to this plugin. https://github.com/SamWM/jQuery-Plugins/blob/master/numeric/jquery.numeric.js
[21:13:27] <Jaredcheeda> I don't even know what you just said. but here's a picture of a cat http://i.imgur.com/Ttn5BPr.jpg
[21:13:34] <Jaredcheeda> KTHNXBI!
[21:13:58] <coder7of9> it should be added to return this.data("numeric.deci... but since the handler is already defined with params how would i add it
[21:16:28] <coldhead> good chat jaredcheeda

[21:34:42] <Inkoniq-QA> hi .. I got a problem with json
[21:35:30] <jaydev> can any one help me to resolve a json ajax problem?
[21:35:59] <tw2113> if you ask your question, maybe
[21:37:03] <jaydev> okay lemmi explain
[21:37:32] <coldhead> please
[21:37:37] <coldhead> so cold
[21:37:51] <jaydev> I'm processing my form request with three fields
[21:38:02] <jaydev> first name,last name, email
[21:38:26] <jaydev> i am sending the URL
[21:38:37] <vladikoff> i bet you are using javascript
[21:38:39] <jaydev> so you can get batter idea
[21:39:10] <jaydev>  http://dev.jumpcatch.com/test2/view/request-page.php
[21:39:22] <jaydev> here is my url
[21:39:29] <jaydev> please use name sandeep
[21:39:33] <jaydev> last name Kumar
[21:39:41] <jaydev> email as sandeep.bly@gmail.com
[21:39:54] <coldhead> this is getting very involved
[21:40:07] <jaydev> am taking form values and converting tthem to json
[21:40:57] <jaydev> now the thng is am able to make api request but generates error
[21:41:06] <jaydev> that can not parse
[21:41:23] <jaydev> please use my details first name, last name and email id
[21:42:07] <jaydev> okay right
[21:45:20] <coldhead> jaydev: it's unusual to use json in a URL
[21:45:38] <coldhead> you would normally use GET style requests
[21:45:41] <coldhead> with serialize()
[21:46:00] <coldhead> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[21:46:49] <jaydev> okay
[21:46:50] <coldhead> jaydev: their documentation says they want POST data
[21:46:55] <dytrivedi> exactly
[21:46:56] <dytrivedi> POST
[21:46:59] <coldhead> so you can't use JSON
[21:47:04] <coldhead> in a GET request
[21:47:06] <coldhead> it's looking for POST
[21:47:09] <coder7of9> how woudl i chain an existing onchange event onto others for the same field :  ....blur($.fn.numeric.blur).change ?
[21:47:51] <dytrivedi> coldhead: ain't it your first day using JSONP APIs?
[21:48:03] <coldhead> yes i just learned this today dytrivedi
[21:48:20] <dytrivedi> I was expecting that.
[21:48:27] <dytrivedi> GODSPEED!
[21:48:36] <coldhead> jaydev: you will have to use a proxy on your own server that forwards your data on to the server as a POST request
[21:49:13] <jaydev> okay that I have to check
[21:49:30] <jaydev> dytrivedi : u there?
[21:49:36] <dytrivedi> yup
[21:49:54] <dytrivedi> In a meeting, so figured out a better way to pass my time is to help in #jquery
[21:50:36] <jaydev> see I am facing a problem, which I just explained to coldhead
[21:51:02] <jaydev> dont know how to resolve it
[21:51:41] <dytrivedi> 1) use POST request
[21:52:04] <dytrivedi> 2) Proxy to your server which in turn forwards your data to that server
[21:52:28] <dytrivedi> and last, use .serialize()
[21:52:36] <dytrivedi> instead of stringifying the JSON
[21:53:54] <coldhead> or use $.magicallyOvercomeTheTechnicalProblemsAndWorkAnyway()
[21:53:58] <coldhead> that's in jquery 1.9
[21:54:37] <jaydev> okay let me try
[21:54:59] <jaydev> Proxy to your server which in turn forwards your data to that server
[21:55:05] <jaydev> what does this mean?
[21:56:09] <coldhead> something like this http://benalman.com/projects/php-simple-proxy/
[21:56:48] <dytrivedi> coldhead: $.magicallyOvercomeTheTechnicalProblemsAndWorkAnyway is a life saver, buddy
[21:56:58] <dytrivedi> BUT DO NOT MENTION THIS IN PUBLIC
[21:57:05] <dytrivedi> it's only for select audience
[21:57:21] <tw2113> *tweets*
[21:57:55] * dytrivedi strangles tw2113 and hijacks his tweet
[21:58:06] <dytrivedi> I'm afraid I'm going to have to involve FBI here, tw2113
[21:58:22] <tw2113> that's ok, they already want me for voting 3rd party
[21:58:29] <tw2113> instead of for kingboy here
[21:58:49] <dytrivedi> jaydev: essentially you're making a cross domain request
[22:00:16] <dytrivedi> and since the API expects POST, you'll have to first send a request to a proxy-php-script on your server (which you can control)
[22:00:36] <dytrivedi> and that script in turn will send a request to the cross domain API, with POST method
[22:00:56] <dytrivedi> and then receive the response, and then forward it back to your front end
[22:01:18] <coldhead> god i wish there were someone who actually deserved your help while you're idling her dytrivedi
[22:01:43] <dytrivedi> hahaha
[22:01:53] <jaydev> yes I am
[22:02:22] <FBI> THIS IS FBI
[22:02:39] <Guest35052> whoa
[22:09:48] <theCatIsPurring>  .join #theCatIsPurring
[22:09:54] <theCatIsPurring> oops sorry
[22:30:50] <abjorn> coldhead: http://twitamore.com/coreyschram I could say I'm surprised but I'm not.

[23:02:33] <gotwig> DTrejo: sleep well, Sir :>
[23:03:13] <Ganjaaa> a question : ive got an $('a').click(function(){  /* Do something */ }) event and an other $('a').click(function(){  /* Do something more */ })  how can i combine them without write them into 1 event
[23:04:52] <gotwig> Ganjaaa: functions?
[23:05:31] <gotwig> Ganjaaa: but in your case, its thew same selector (?)
[23:05:35] <gotwig> *the
[23:05:45] <Muthu> is it possible to use jsonp without callback ?
[23:06:02] <Ganjaaa> the problem is i cant change the source of the first click event i only can add more code
[23:06:11] <gotwig> Muthu: post request?
[23:06:37] <Muthu> yes. i know. we cannt use post. In Get method.
[23:07:33] <Ganjaaa> i want to write a plugin the capture all clicks on links .. the problem is wht is if someone got also a click event on all a tags .. so my event overwrite them
[23:08:30] <systemfault> Muthu: Nope, jsonp is a hack. You can use JSON with CORS but only on recent browsers.
[23:09:04] <Muthu> Ok Thanks for confirming
[23:09:10] <systemfault> Ganjaaa: You can add as many event handlers as you want, you won't override anything.
[23:10:13] <Ganjaaa> really ? if i got 2 diffrent click event handler they use both actions?
[23:10:50] <Cork> Ganjaaa: unless either of them user return false;
[23:11:17] <Cork> if event.preventDefault() is used instead; then yes both are used
[23:12:38] <Ganjaaa> ahh ty :)
[23:17:35] <Ganjaaa> wusa i tesed it :) thanks for help its work
[23:43:31] <GoSox> What is that feature/property of javascript called, that doesn't let http requests hit up different domains?
[23:44:54] <Cork> cross scripting blockages
[23:45:05] <Cork> or blocked cross domain calls
[23:45:16] <GoSox> ah right
[23:45:55] <GoSox> so do they block subdomains too? for example, could i have scripts on www.menulizard.com and m.menulizard.com both call pages on data.menulizard.com ? or is that also blocked?
[23:46:28] <Cork> you can, but you need to set the document.domain i think (not sure if thats the real name)
[23:47:11] <Cork> ?mdc document.domain
[23:47:20] <Cork> >_>
[23:47:25] <Cork> *sigh* down again...
[23:47:35] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/DOM/document.domain
[23:48:01] <ItsJustMe> Hey there :)
[23:50:48] <baptistem> o/
[23:51:04] <baptistem> I forget (shame on me) how to handle the contenteditable with something like .change()
[23:51:34] <Cork> i don't think you can use .change, but i might be wrong
[23:51:46] <baptistem> any other idea then?
[23:51:50] <Cork> i think you need to use keypress/keyup
[23:51:56] <GoSox> hmmm maybe i should just do an apache directory alias on my sites and have them both point to one shared data folder. that might be easier then trying to get this document.domain thing to work
[23:52:18] <baptistem> someone suggested blur
[23:52:39] <Cork> baptistem: then it would only update when you move the focus from the field
[23:53:04] <Cork> GoSox: document.domain should be easy
[23:53:05] <baptistem> well this not really a problem
[23:53:14] <Cork> just set it to the top tomain you have when you start
[23:53:44] <GoSox> but what i want to do is load one subdomain, from another subdomain
[23:53:46] <Cork> ex. your on sub.example.com and ajax.example.com is your target; do document.domain = 'example.com';
[23:54:06] <GoSox> that will make calls to ajax.example.com work?
[23:54:11] <Cork> yes
[23:54:13] <GoSox> wouldn't that make neither work?
[23:54:38] <Cork> GoSox: i think that should make it work
[23:54:50] <Cork> but i might mix it up with cookies
[23:55:06] <GoSox> all my cookies are domain global, on purpose,
[23:55:41] <Cork> but if that doesn't work, the only options left is a reverse proxy on the same domain; or cors
[23:55:45] <ItsJustMe> I still need something to update a number live .. I tried several plugins for jquery, but my value is not really live updated .. It's a price and if someone enters 999 it shall be 9, then 9.9 and then 9.99 .. but at once o.o
[23:55:49] <ItsJustMe> someone an idea?
[23:55:55] <Cork> GoSox: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/Access_control_CORS
[23:55:57] <GoSox> assuming you are right, i'm not sure which solution i like better. Each subdomain loading data from a data.example.com , or each domain loading data from an example.com/data where data is the same thing, via apache aliases
[23:56:06] <Cork> problem with cors is that its not supported by ie
[23:57:27] <Cork> ItsJustMe: it would have to work with keypress, and that kinda sucks cause it triggers before the field is updated
[23:57:38] <Cork> ItsJustMe: though that is possible to workaround
[23:58:06] <baptistem> well I think I'm no more uptodate with jq : http://jsbin.com/izucel/3/watch not working
[23:58:20] <baptistem> in fact I was expecting to log just if I change something but, not today
[23:59:05] <Cork> baptistem: you forgot dom ready
[23:59:09] <baptistem> (the textarea is now replacing the contenteditable (which was way html cleaner)
[23:59:11] * baptistem facepalm
[23:59:32] <baptistem> act as I never past it ok? :D
[23:59:45] <Cork> also you can't combine <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.9.0.min.js"> and scripts i the tag
