[03:02:08] <jak2000> hi all
[03:02:31] <jak2000> i have this: var nomFile='/home/jak/swItsol/QDL/2018/PEDIDOS/MEXICO, D.F. (16-MARZO-2018)CAMION 1.xls'  how to extract the filename (only) ?
[03:07:25] <Woet> jak2000: what did you try so far?
[03:19:31] <jak2000> i want remove: /home/jak/swItsol/QDL/2018/PEDIDOS/  and get only: MEXICO, D.F. (16-MARZO-2018)CAMION 1.xls
[03:19:33] <jak2000> how to?
[03:19:38] <Cork> jak2000: nomFile.match(/[^\/]+$/)[0]
[03:19:59] <Cork> or split('/') and grab the last part in the array
[03:20:25] <Woet> jak2000: what did you try so far?
[03:21:11] <jak2000> var nomfile2=nomFile.split('/') ?
[03:21:27] <Cork> check the result
[03:23:42] <jak2000> checking
[03:24:08] <Woet> jak2000: so you didn't try anything? no googling? no reading documentation?
[03:29:29] <jak2000> interesting
[03:29:31] <jak2000> both...
[03:29:39] <jak2000> Woet no head, escuse me
[03:29:51] <jak2000> nomFile.match(/[^\/]+$/)[0] give me the fielname
[03:30:02] <jak2000> and nomFile.split('/')  split......
[03:30:29] <jak2000> then my friend is: nomFile[nomFile.length-1];  :)
[03:30:31] <Cork> ya, but the last element in the result array is the same as the regex
[03:30:58] <Cork> so use .split if you're uncomfortable with regex
[03:31:18] <jak2000> hard to undersand
[03:31:24] <jak2000> by moment no time to learn
[03:31:26] <jak2000> thanks
[03:31:39] <Cork> just "grab all characters at the end of the string that isn't a /"
[03:32:25] <Woet> jak2000: you know this channel, and IRC in general, is for learning right?
[03:32:44] <Woet> generally people don't just give you code ready to copy/paste and move on
[03:32:50] <Woet> with the exception of Cork
[03:33:02] <Cork> Woet: just shut up...
[03:33:24] <jak2000> Woet always i googling and learn but at this time
[03:33:28] <Woet> you can ignore me if you disagree. I prefer teaching people how to learn/find information.
[03:33:46] <Cork> Woet: no you prefer to mock ppl
[03:33:46] <Woet> jak2000: it's faster.
[03:33:55] <Woet> Cork: how did I mock anyone?
[03:33:55] <jak2000> i only need fix some errors
[03:34:09] <jak2000> Woet want a coffe or preffer a beer?
[03:34:14] <Woet> jak2000: neither.
[03:34:29] <jak2000> cigarrete?
[03:34:33] <jak2000> a woman?
[03:34:43] <Woet> jak2000: "javascript get filename from path" in google gives you countless results with code
[03:35:08] <jak2000> ok sorry
[03:35:23] <Woet> jak2000: learning how to help yourself is one of the most important skills in development
[03:35:30] <Woet> and life in general I'd argue
[03:37:50] <jak2000> ok, sorry, thanks
[03:38:18] <Woet> no worries
[03:38:24] <Woet> or just hope Cork is around to do your work for free :)
[03:38:26] <jak2000> thanks Cork
[08:37:59] <dimi1947> tell me this pls...is the name attribute necessary in an input for the serializeArray method to work?
[08:38:23] <Cork> how would it else serialize it?
[08:38:50] <Cork> so yes an input needs to have a name, not only for serializeArray
[08:39:09] <Cork> (inputs should always have a name)
[08:57:19] <anli> Does input[type=hidden] have a shortcut selector?
[08:57:58] <Cork> no
[10:07:11] <poboy> I'm back with more stupid questions!
[10:08:17] <Cork> there are no stupid questions
[10:08:30] <Cork> (uninformed possibly, but not stupid)
[10:08:58] <poboy> so this function is "working" but first I feel like it's ugly.  Also, I don't know how to call this function without something like this $('.fa-calendar').getData();   https://jsfiddle.net/s1u8wn8o/3/
[10:09:47] <poboy> basically I want to call this function in multiple places, when certain icons are clicked.  Will someone show me how to clean it up and the right way to call it?
[10:11:19] <Cork> poboy: so you want a nested array of all the td:s in the table?
[10:11:42] <Cork> or why do you loop on a tr level?
[10:13:01] <poboy> well I think I only need the data from each row where the checkbox is checked.  But for now it's grabbing an array of every row
[10:13:10] <poboy> but yes to nested array
[10:13:43] <poboy> I still suck so bad with javascript (I'm a PHP guy) and I'm not sure why
[10:14:13] <Cork> and what data is it you want?
[10:14:21] <Cork> currently you store the value of the checkbox
[10:14:42] <Cork> (if that is what you want, why not just use serializeArray?)
[10:14:54] <poboy> because I'm not familiar with serializeArray
[10:15:13] <Cork> $('datatable :checkbox').serializeArray()
[10:15:26] <poboy> I want the entire row of data, if the checkbox has a value
[10:15:40] <Cork> that isn't what the code does though
[10:15:46] <poboy> it's setup where that value is the particular id.  so it's not just 0 or 1
[10:15:46] <Cork> it does :checkbox.val()
[10:15:56] <poboy> i know, this was the best I could do so far  :)
[10:16:15] <Cork> ok, 1. you would have to include what you are working with in the html part
[10:16:54] <Cork> and 2. for the selection i would do $('#datatable :checkbox:checked').closest('tr') and work with that
[10:28:10] <poboy> Cork I've updated with some sample html data.  https://jsfiddle.net/s1u8wn8o/15/   I'm not sure how to add the closest('tr') bit when trying to loop through each row
[10:32:03] <poboy> Also, what about calling the function?  since it's being executed onClick is there another way to call it other than $('.icon-buttons').getData();?
[10:35:38] <poboy> sweet, I can just name it function getData without all that jquery stuff
[11:09:23] <EugenA> I want to use reCaptcha, but my callback-function myFunc is inside of requirejs-module. Is it possible to use myFunc?
[11:39:51] <tycoon177> I have a question regarding event delegation. I'm trying to have a form automatically be submitted when the user makes a change. I have this working through a `$(document).on('input change', 'form.identifying-class-name', function(){...})` and sometimes change is triggered by a text field losing focus, even if the value hasn't changed.
[11:40:22] <tycoon177> Is there an event that I can bind here that will only be fired when the value of an input changes? in this form specifically, i just have 2 checkboxes and a text field
[11:40:34] <tycoon177> but I would like to find a universal solution if possible
[12:37:30] <someguy8881> i've got the following code: https://dpaste.de/vtC8 which I'm trying to test (using jasmine) like this: https://dpaste.de/LNJ9
[12:37:43] <someguy8881> i'd like to mock the stripe function to test error/success
[12:38:15] <someguy8881> but I always get "TypeError: Cannot read property 'createToken' of undefined" and `stripe` is undefined in the form submit handler
[12:38:31] <someguy8881> although it is defined in the test code before calling .submit()
[12:38:49] <someguy8881> no clue why. any help would be greatly appreciated
[12:40:41] <taplar> line 9 happens after line 5 has executed
[12:42:01] <taplar> the beforeEach() executes before each it(), as it's name implies
[12:43:46] <someguy8881> taplar: I tried something like this https://dpaste.de/kARc but still get the same error
[12:44:19] <taplar> do you still get the error if you comment out line 6?
[12:45:25] <someguy8881> taplar: nope. but the jasmine SpecRunner page just keeps refreshing
[12:45:34] <taplar> hmm
[12:46:39] <taplar> for shiggles, try changing your 'stripe' to 'window.stripe' any where you reference it
[12:47:29] <taplar> it doesn't have var on it, so it should be global, but there may be something scope wise i'm missing
[12:48:47] <someguy8881> nope, still no luck with window. if I console.log() stripe is defined before the .submit() but always undefined when stripe.createToken() is called
[12:49:11] <taplar> did you change all occurances of stripe to 'window.stripe' ?
[12:51:03] <someguy8881> taplar: yeah. Just double checked and tried it again, no luck
[12:51:27] <taplar> weird.  not sure then
[12:52:08] <someguy8881> no worries, will keep it at it. thanks taplar
[12:53:22] <madprops> somethign pretty odd is happening
[12:53:44] <madprops> i have this https://paste.ee/p/Ios5j
[12:54:20] <madprops> it works if i place that on an element, but the onclick wont bind if i place it in another element ... only differences are parent's css
[12:54:27] <madprops> there is no pointer-events: none
[12:54:29] <madprops> anywhere
[12:56:28] <robertmaxrees> madprops got a fiddle?
[12:56:47] <madprops> i'll try
[13:06:35] <madprops> can't seem to reproduce it
[13:09:00] <robertmaxrees> so one thing i might change is to use a delegated binding, instead of a direct oner.
[13:11:33] <robertmaxrees> hummm
[13:11:36] <robertmaxrees> woops wrong window
[14:04:58] <someguywhatever> i've got the following function https://dpaste.de/6jRa with this jasmine test https://dpaste.de/z6NB - how can I setup that `stripe` variable to test what happens with result.error?
[14:18:50] <robertmaxrees> can't remember how jasmine does it, but you want to mock stripe (and by extension the createToken method) and return a promise that you spy.
[14:20:58] <taplar> there's a spyOn() method that takes an object and a string method name
[14:21:15] <taplar> but stripe would have to already exist to use that
[14:21:38] <taplar> cause it would be like spyOn( stripe, "createToken" );
[14:26:57] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:26:59] <robertmaxrees> taplar+++
[14:27:09] <robertmaxrees> gotta make a karmabot for this channel.
[14:28:30] <grapheti> I get all the negative points.
[14:54:04] <poboy> so starting fresh here.  Just want to loop through this table, and if the checkbox in a row is checked I want an array of the "Primary Point Person" for all checked rows.   tried "input[type=checkbox]:checked" in the .each function to no avail.  https://jsfiddle.net/z5190tgw/9/
[14:54:43] <robertmaxrees> why not filter to those you want?
[14:54:57] <robertmaxrees> and then map() it
[14:54:57] <taplar> you put a selector straight into an if
[14:55:13] <taplar> "if(input[type=checkbox]:checked) {" <--
[14:55:23] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:55:30] <poboy> was trying to do something like $(this).inputblahblah
[14:56:52] <taplar> take a look at what robert suggested
[14:56:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[14:57:16] <poboy> googling jquery filter.  W3 schools it is
[14:57:25] <robertmaxrees> erm
[14:57:27] <taplar> or api.jquery.com
[14:57:30] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[15:01:49] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[15:05:13] <poboy> It sucks, because before I got into programming, I used to consider myself a smart guy.  ah well
[15:06:57] <robertmaxrees> poboy where are you getting stuck?
[15:09:02] <robertmaxrees> sounds like maybe you just need some help breaking the problem down :)
[15:10:28] <poboy> so I first need to filter the #datatable and return all rows where "input[type=checkbox]:checked"  I think
[15:10:41] <poboy> or maybe  $("input[type=checkbox]:checked").  Idk
[15:10:56] <taplar> you want to filter the rows where the row has a child that matches that
[15:11:09] <taplar> or
[15:11:21] <taplar> find all of them that match that, and then get their parent rows
[15:11:45] <poboy> so I'm not filtering the table I'm filtering the <tr>s?
[15:11:51] <taplar> yep
[15:12:00] <taplar> or not filtering at all with the second approach
[15:12:53] <taplar> you can think of the two approaches sorta like if you were trying to find which houses amongst 5 houses have a blue car
[15:13:05] <taplar> you could get all the houses, and then go to each one and ask if they have a blue car
[15:13:16] <taplar> or you could get all the blue cars, and ask their owners where there house is
[15:15:09] <taplar> so you could $(selectorForRows).filter(function(){ return //true if this row has a checked checkbox });
[15:15:12] <taplar> or
[15:15:21] <taplar> $(selectorForCheckedCheckboxes).closest('tr')
[15:15:58] <taplar> comprende?
[15:17:25] <poboy> well, so in that first example, how do you know if it's checked?  Idk if I"m supposed to use an if statement or what
[15:17:44] <taplar> yeah it would be some conditional
[15:17:51] <robertmaxrees> for which?
[15:17:55] <robertmaxrees> the .filter() ?
[15:17:59] <taplar> yeah
[15:18:01] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[15:18:05] <robertmaxrees> no need for a conditional./
[15:18:15] <robertmaxrees> you just return .prop('checked') on the checkbox.
[15:18:25] <taplar> oh, true
[15:18:28] <robertmaxrees> :)
[15:18:51] <taplar> yeah, so you could find the nested checkbox and return the checked property on it
[15:18:53] <poboy> hmm
[15:19:02] <taplar> i was being silly and thinking about a length check
[15:19:06] <poboy> I tried this but the alert popped twice
[15:19:06] <robertmaxrees> oh hah.
[15:19:08] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/z5190tgw/28/
[15:19:09] <robertmaxrees> show us.
[15:19:17] <robertmaxrees> nonono.
[15:19:31] <robertmaxrees> if ("input[type=checkbox]:checked") { is just a string.,
[15:19:33] <robertmaxrees> which is always true.
[15:19:38] <robertmaxrees> you're not selecting anything there.
[15:19:42] <poboy> $()
[15:19:47] <robertmaxrees> that's also the wrong selector :)
[15:20:21] <poboy> well fuck
[15:20:26] <robertmaxrees> poboy you're close tho!
[15:20:26] <poboy> pardon my english
[15:20:44] <robertmaxrees> so when you do $('input') - you're selecting ALL inputs.  you wanna contextualize it instead.
[15:21:07] <taplar> $(selector) is the same as doing $(selector, document)
[15:21:23] <robertmaxrees> within most jQuery callbacks, the 'this' object is set to the current element.
[15:21:46] <robertmaxrees> so in your filter, your 'this' is the current element.
[15:21:53] <robertmaxrees> ie a TR
[15:34:48] <poboy> I'm just not understanding how to use filter.  every option I try is doing the whole column.
[15:35:37] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/z5190tgw/44/
[15:37:57] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/z5190tgw/47/
[15:53:55] <poboy> woot.  1 step done an hour later, lol
[15:54:23] <robertmaxrees> :D
[15:54:26] <robertmaxrees> whatcha got so far?
[15:55:13] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/z5190tgw/60/
[15:56:14] <robertmaxrees> even better
[15:56:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z5190tgw/62/
[15:57:18] <robertmaxrees> err, https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z5190tgw/64/
[15:57:25] <robertmaxrees> killing that unused var.
[15:59:12] <poboy> but in that case $array returns both <tr>s
[15:59:48] <robertmaxrees> no it doesn't.
[15:59:54] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z5190tgw/68/
[16:01:06] <robertmaxrees> .prop('checked') returns true or false.
[16:01:06] <poboy> hmm.  when you console.log($array)  there are 2 tr
[16:01:11] <robertmaxrees> wat
[16:01:15] <robertmaxrees> not on that fiddle.
[16:01:24] <robertmaxrees> i'm getting 0
[16:01:44] <poboy> oh prevObject probably doesn't mean anything huh
[16:01:54] <poboy> lol
[16:02:07] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:02:09] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[16:03:12] <poboy> https://pasteboard.co/Hdh8ZS0.png
[16:03:40] <robertmaxrees> it does, but it's not what you care about.
[16:03:46] <robertmaxrees> the length property is what you care about.
[16:03:50] <robertmaxrees> okay so now
[16:04:05] <robertmaxrees> you have a jquery object of all trs that match.  now you wanna get an array of names, right?
[16:04:14] <poboy> yes
[16:04:21] <robertmaxrees> so jquery has a tool for that!
[16:04:24] <robertmaxrees> it's called .map()
[16:04:32] <robertmaxrees> ever used the native js map?
[16:04:39] <poboy> not me
[16:04:49] <poboy> I'm  PHP dev.  JS scares me, haha
[16:05:03] <robertmaxrees> okay - so the idea with .map() is it lets you transform one format into another.
[16:05:23] <robertmaxrees> so in this case, you wanna go from a jquery object into just a name, right?
[16:05:48] <theology> poboy, php scares me
[16:06:19] <poboy> hmm. I"m guessing yes.  I need an array of names
[16:06:29] <poboy> I guess a list of strings would work though
[16:06:36] <robertmaxrees> *array
[16:06:47] <robertmaxrees> (there are no lists in js - we can get the array super easy)
[16:07:02] <poboy> I really appreciate everyone's help. I know I ask basic questions
[16:07:09] <robertmaxrees> nah it's all good.
[16:07:15] <robertmaxrees> we've all been there :D
[16:07:17] <robertmaxrees> so what you want to do is use .map(function() {})
[16:07:25] <robertmaxrees> the function will return out the specific thing you want,.
[16:08:54] <robertmaxrees> (there's gonna be one last step after this so just stick with me for now)_
[16:08:57] <robertmaxrees> does that make sense?
[16:09:01] <poboy> it does
[16:09:07] <robertmaxrees> killer
[16:09:10] <poboy> going through the map docs now
[16:09:19] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:28:35] <poboy> So how do I just get the text from .eq(5)  for values?   var $names = $.map($array, function(value, key)
[16:28:55] <robertmaxrees> nononon
[16:28:57] <robertmaxrees> no $.map
[16:29:09] <robertmaxrees> show me whatcha got so far.
[16:29:53] <poboy> oh.  that was it
[16:30:01] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/z5190tgw/85/
[16:30:02] <robertmaxrees> update the fiddle tho :)
[16:30:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z5190tgw/86/
[16:30:35] <robertmaxrees> you want this .map() instead.
[16:31:13] <poboy> sigh
[16:31:18] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:31:22] <robertmaxrees> it's alright duder.
[16:31:38] <robertmaxrees> so your $(this) is the tr, right?
[16:31:50] <poboy> yes
[16:32:12] <robertmaxrees> so how would you get the td that .eq(5) ?
[16:32:20] <robertmaxrees> that's a chjild of that tr
[16:32:28] <robertmaxrees> or descended, either/or
[16:33:16] <poboy> $( this ).find( "td:eq(5)" )  I think
[16:33:25] <robertmaxrees> easy way to find out :)
[16:34:22] <poboy> ok, so the names are in there somewhere, so that's good  :D
[16:34:27] <robertmaxrees> so now.
[16:34:34] <robertmaxrees> how do you get the text from a jquery object?
[16:34:51] <poboy> I thought it was .text
[16:34:55] <poboy> I tried that and .val()
[16:34:55] <robertmaxrees> so try that now :)
[16:34:59] <robertmaxrees> .val() is for inputs
[16:35:42] <poboy> definitely not it
[16:35:56] <poboy> ooh
[16:35:57] <poboy> .text()
[16:36:00] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:36:21] <robertmaxrees> so what do you do with that?
[16:36:47] <poboy> I need an array of $names so I can do cools stuff with it on the php stide
[16:36:51] <poboy> *side
[16:36:55] <robertmaxrees> i mean within the map
[16:39:06] <robertmaxrees> (there's gonna be another step after we're done with the map)
[16:39:15] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/z5190tgw/95/
[16:39:17] <robertmaxrees> ('cause you want an array, not a jquery object)
[16:40:11] <robertmaxrees> non
[16:40:15] <robertmaxrees> you want to return that
[16:40:20] <robertmaxrees> not set it to a var.
[16:40:26] <poboy> ah
[16:40:40] <robertmaxrees> also fwiw most people use $ in var names to denote it's a jquery object, but .text() returns a string
[16:41:07] <robertmaxrees> okay so once you return those names, you'll need to do one final tweak to turn that into an array.
[16:41:13] <poboy> now jsfiddle is unhappy  https://jsfiddle.net/z5190tgw/97/
[16:41:24] <robertmaxrees> return $names = $( this ).find( "td:eq(5)" ).text(); erm
[16:41:37] <robertmaxrees> why are you returing a var assignment?
[16:41:40] <robertmaxrees> you just want the text.
[16:41:44] <poboy> doh.  mistake
[16:41:47] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:41:51] <poboy> thought i deleted that
[16:42:47] <robertmaxrees> okay so now to go from a jquery object, you gotta just add a .get() to the end of that chain
[16:43:01] <robertmaxrees> i know it seems silly, but you'll wanna do it.
[16:43:02] <poboy> for reals?
[16:43:30] <robertmaxrees> yeh.  the issue is you have a jquery object which isn't really serializable into JSON.
[16:44:02] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/z5190tgw/100/
[16:44:25] <robertmaxrees> nono.
[16:44:27] <robertmaxrees> not to the functionm.
[16:44:41] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z5190tgw/105/
[16:44:49] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/z5190tgw/106/
[16:44:53] <robertmaxrees> ^ the second one fixed the map.
[16:45:07] <robertmaxrees> (you were missing the $ for $(this))
[16:45:53] <poboy> your patience is amazing.  :)
[16:45:58] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:46:02] <robertmaxrees> i'm glad to do it
[16:47:16] <poboy> thanks so much robertmaxrees
[16:47:43] <robertmaxrees> of course!  it's why we're here.
[16:47:53] <robertmaxrees> and well done!  thanks for sticking with it :)
[16:48:02] <robertmaxrees> feel like you're understanding jquery a bit better?>
[16:49:35] <poboy> for sure
[16:49:39] <robertmaxrees> rad
[16:50:02] <poboy> $(this), this  $map .map  I need to read up on
[16:50:39] <robertmaxrees> the difference is $.map() is for arrays/objects.
[16:50:53] <robertmaxrees> $('foo').map is for jquery objects.
[16:55:03] <poboy> ah, ok
[17:14:22] <Anthaas> Im adding a html element on click of another element by doing: $('otherElement').before(newHtml); but am not seeing any UI change?
[17:15:15] <robertmaxrees> what's your actual elector?
[17:15:47] <Anthaas> oops, #
[17:16:01] <robertmaxrees> gotta fiddle?
[17:16:01] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:16:04] <Anthaas> $('#addElement').before(newHtml);
[17:16:07] <Anthaas> Uhh, sure.
[17:16:10] <Anthaas> One sec.
[17:16:19] <robertmaxrees> i know it seems silly, but if I do it myself, it'll work fine.
[17:16:24] <robertmaxrees> so i need to see what you're actually doing :)
[17:19:29] <Anthaas> robertmaxrees, No, makes complete sense.
[17:21:17] <Anthaas> robertmaxrees, https://jsfiddle.net/f2kdkydz/3/
[17:21:25] <Anthaas> I think that is a reasonable facsimile of what Im trying.
[17:21:32] <Anthaas> I've tried to make it as minimal an example as possible.
[17:21:44] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:21:49] <robertmaxrees> check your console :)
[17:22:10] <Anthaas> robertmaxrees, Ok, so that is a bad representation then - my console is clear.
[17:22:35] <robertmaxrees> so I can think of 2 other ideas.
[17:22:44] <robertmaxrees> 1 - are you sure your click event is actually firing?
[17:23:17] <Anthaas> robertmaxrees, 1 - yes, I am logging "click" to the console to check this, and am seeing it.
[17:23:32] <robertmaxrees> okay - and #2 -you're not repeating that ID, right?
[17:23:48] <Anthaas> Nope
[17:24:06] <robertmaxrees> no idea then.
[17:24:35] <Anthaas> Hmm, maybe if i post the actual code to a pastebin or something, something will stand out?
[17:24:35] <robertmaxrees> unless you're constructing some bad markup to pass to .before()
[17:24:46] <robertmaxrees> that would be helpful
[17:26:41] <Anthaas> robertmaxrees, https://dpaste.de/yMYA
[17:27:00] <Anthaas> Perhaps the \t and \n?
[17:27:32] <Anthaas> FWIW, on load I do see the 3 elements Im adding there...
[17:27:35] <Anthaas> So that function seems to work...
[17:28:03] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[17:28:12] <robertmaxrees> your click handler doesn't make sense.
[17:28:13] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:28:35] <Anthaas> does "this" not represent the element?
[17:28:59] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/0e68793d763a
[17:29:03] <robertmaxrees> see the issue now?
[17:29:10] <robertmaxrees> $(this).before(addIngredientElement);
[17:29:18] <robertmaxrees> you're bound to addIngredientElement
[17:29:24] <Anthaas> -.-
[17:29:25] <Anthaas> hahahaha
[17:29:27] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:29:34] <robertmaxrees> "put this element before itself"
[17:29:50] <Anthaas> hahah I feel so stupid - I autocompleted the wrong thing, and then couldn't see it.
[17:29:53] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[17:29:56] <robertmaxrees> it's all good.
[17:30:01] <robertmaxrees> it happens to the best of us.
[17:30:26] <Anthaas> Thank you so much for your help.
[17:30:33] <robertmaxrees> absodudely!
[17:30:37] <robertmaxrees> s'what we're here for :)
[18:44:59] <taplar> whomp whomp
[18:47:30] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[19:25:15] <Anthaas> Is it possible to animate in elements added with before?
[19:25:35] <robertmaxrees> Anthaas like, with .before() ?
[19:25:41] <Anthaas> e.g. $('#elementToBeInsertedBefore').before(elementToInsert).withAnimation()
[19:25:50] <robertmaxrees> yes, but not like that/.
[19:26:09] <robertmaxrees> $('#elementToBeInsertedBefore').before(elementToInsert); elementToInsert.withAnimation();
[19:27:11] <Anthaas> My Google-fu is letting me down - I can't see any example or documentation of this.
[19:27:30] <robertmaxrees> it's because .before() doesn't return what you need it to return.
[19:29:01] <robertmaxrees> Anthaas https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/abg2py75/1/
[19:34:22] <Anthaas> robertmaxrees, If you remember, my 'click' function adds a html string - I can't animate that
[19:34:36] <Anthaas> Do I need to get the most recent object and then animate that?
[19:34:53] <Anthaas> (after the before() call)
[19:35:25] <robertmaxrees> sorry, was away for a sec
[19:35:30] <Anthaas> np
[19:35:33] <robertmaxrees> so you have a few options.
[19:35:59] <robertmaxrees> 1: make them jquery objects first and save those vars to reference later.  2: give them some kind of class you can select on and animate that.
[19:36:23] <robertmaxrees> there's no concept of "most recent object"
[19:36:45] <Anthaas> n-1th element inside my container?
[19:36:56] <robertmaxrees> i would avoid that if at all possible.
[19:37:11] <robertmaxrees> mostly because it means that when your markup changes, this will break.
[19:37:23] <Anthaas> I mean, creating a jquery object from the html string of course would be better.
[19:37:38] <robertmaxrees> which is very trivial to do in this case :)
[19:38:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/abg2py75/5/
[19:40:30] <Anthaas> robertmaxrees, There is now _some_ animation happening - just need to work out how to get it to slide open to full size.
[19:40:42] <robertmaxrees> "full size"?
[19:41:53] <Anthaas> of the element
[19:42:02] <Anthaas> Or is that something I have to work out and then hard code?
[19:42:12] <robertmaxrees> i would look into css transitions at this point instead./
[20:08:28] <Anthaas> I refer to earlier statement that I suck at CSS
[20:08:33] <Anthaas> Only one way to learn though, I suppose...
[21:25:15] <fas3r> Hello
[23:08:33] <theology> how can i ensure that two <video>s play at the exact same time everytime a button is pressed?
[23:12:03] <Woet> theology: what are you doing right now that doesn't work?
[23:18:01] <theology> Woet, $('#video0').get(0).play(); $('#video1').get(1).play(); -- there is lag
[23:18:11] <theology> there is lag more than half the time
[23:18:17] <Woet> theology: show your test case and debug code
[23:23:03] <theology> Woet, https://jsfiddle.net/n7u4twb1/3/
[23:34:51] <theology> Woet, this code is closer to my actual code: https://jsfiddle.net/n7u4twb1/11/
[23:38:14] <Woet> theology: are you sure it isn't just buffering? they play instantly for me.
[23:38:46] <Woet> theology: try setting preload
[23:40:00] <theology> Woet, what is preload?
[23:40:07] <Woet> theology: read up on the video element
[23:46:19] <theology> Woet, setting preload to true and setting currentTime = 0 for both vids worked. thanks
