[00:00:01] <Cork> then remove the >
[00:00:11] <Shazer[2]> Thanks LukeNukem.
[00:00:12] <Shazer[2]> :)
[00:00:18] <sayyestolife> Ah right, how silly of me
[00:00:19] <LukeNukem> no worres ;}
[00:00:38] <LukeNukem> Shazer[2], empty div is the output of the process.php file
[00:00:44] <LukeNukem> i mean, the output will appear into that div
[00:00:45] <Shazer[2]> Alright.
[00:01:16] <LukeNukem> even then, after the submit event, instead of ajax you can use .post
[00:02:01] <LukeNukem> it is equivalent to the ajax code in the fiddle i just gave you
[00:06:59] <sviatovigt> how can I change the scope of a variable?
[00:07:52] <Cork> sviatovigt: you can't
[00:08:06] <Cork> you declare it in the scope you want it to have
[00:08:18] <Cork> or you assign it to an object used in that scope
[00:08:35] <codepal> what have I created? --- http://freebiesaround.com/
[00:08:42] <codepal> doesn't seem to ever want to stop loading...
[00:08:54] <codepal> massive memory leak because of ajax no doubt...
[00:09:04] <codepal> I thought I called die();
[00:09:14] <sviatovigt> so, if I declare a variable inside $.(document).ready(), I will not be able to use it in a function outside $.(document).ready()?
[00:09:37] <Cork> codepal: side note, you have an error on line 253
[00:09:38] <LukeNukem> nope
[00:09:43] <LukeNukem> you wont be sviatovigt
[00:09:46] <Cork> name="cat"value="3"
[00:10:11] <sviatovigt> and there is no workaround that could get me out of this trouble?
[00:10:20] <Shazer[2]> LukeNukem: that helped. :)
[00:10:36] <yamahaalex37> I cant tell the difference between what is ajax and what is jQuery
[00:10:41] <Shazer[2]> Let's say I have a class element and an element inside that class element
[00:10:43] <yamahaalex37> like jquery .post
[00:10:46] <Shazer[2]> and I want to add to say a "list"
[00:10:49] <Shazer[2]> Is that possible?
[00:10:55] <Cork> sviatovigt: exactly, you can assign the variable to window though
[00:10:59] <LukeNukem> sviatovigt, what is your "trouble"
[00:11:03] <LukeNukem> Shazer[2], on submit of a form?
[00:11:04] <Cork> sviatovigt: window.public_variable = 10;
[00:11:17] <sviatovigt> Cork: ok
[00:11:21] <sviatovigt> thank you
[00:11:27] <Cork> np
[00:11:31] <LukeNukem> what if its dynamic?
[00:11:39] <LukeNukem> what if the variables he is looking for is dynamic, like mine..
[00:11:45] <sviatovigt> LukeNukem: Cork answered my question
[00:11:52] <Shazer[2]> LukeNukem: http://screensnapr.com/v/5xlQ3Q.jpg
[00:11:58] <sviatovigt> but I still have one left
[00:12:10] <LukeNukem> sviatovigt, these so called "variables", where do they come from?
[00:12:22] <Cork> <_<'
[00:12:36] <beasty> (:
[00:12:44] <sviatovigt>  if I call a function from an element in a page, how can I get the element that is calling (the function is not outside $.(document).ready() )?
[00:12:46] <LukeNukem> i dont understand sviatovigt
[00:13:18] <Cork> sviatovigt: you mean... like from an inline event?
[00:13:22] <LukeNukem> sorry
[00:13:27] <LukeNukem> i dont understand what you mean Shazer[2]
[00:13:40] <beasty> sviatovigt: you want to call a function from outside the scope ?
[00:14:04] <sviatovigt> Cork: let me please answer LukeNukem and then I will clarify my question
[00:15:00] <sviatovigt> LukeNukem: I have written the javascript for my page in a js file, inside $.(document).ready()
[00:15:39] <sviatovigt> basically, all the actions that are available on the page are triggered by listners on various element
[00:15:44] <codepal> Cork - 253 of the html?
[00:15:54] <Cork> codepal: yes
[00:16:07] <sviatovigt> for example: $('#edit-personal').click(function() {} )
[00:16:10] <Cork> codepal: though as i said, its a side note, html warnings
[00:18:10] <sviatovigt> unfortunately, I have realized that I will not be able to continue writing this kind of code because some of the elements in my page are dynamically created
[00:18:50] <Cork> sviatovigt: so use delegate
[00:19:03] <sviatovigt> so I will also have to create functions available on calling from an inline event
[00:19:04] <Cork> or in modern jquery on's delegate syntax
[00:20:17] <sviatovigt> Cork: I am using delegate but this doesn't suffice
[00:20:33] <sviatovigt> and it is harder
[00:20:34] <codepal> I missed a 'a' in javascript
[00:20:36] <codepal> omg
[00:20:43] <codepal> what noob!
[00:20:47] * codepal hides in shame
[00:20:55] <sviatovigt> it is simpler to use a function and trigger it from an inline event
[00:20:57] <Shazer[2]> Dynamically adding to a div..
[00:20:58] <Shazer[2]> I guess.
[00:21:34] <Cork> codepal: lol, thats not really noob, but ya, its an itching feeling when you see thouse :)
[00:22:06] <Shazer[2]> @ LukeNukem btw ^
[00:22:26] <sviatovigt> LukeNukem: because of this, I have some variables that I create inside $.(document).ready() that I want to make available for using inside functions outside $.(document).ready()
[00:22:50] <Cork> sviatovigt: inline events has a tendency to bite you later though, cause it is an old broken way to handle events
[00:23:04] <sviatovigt> Cork: I know
[00:23:15] <sviatovigt> but.... it is faster at this moment
[00:23:34] <Cork> sviatovigt: an alternative is to use an attribute with a string that reprecent the function to run
[00:23:49] <Cork> something like data-handler="update_something"
[00:23:54] <sviatovigt> since I will have to create various regular expressions to detect what event occured
[00:24:11] <tw2113> quirky corky?
[00:24:21] <Cork> :)
[00:24:28] <Cork> its actually quite nice
[00:24:51] <Cork> you can often abstract the code to give good control through that
[00:24:57] <Shazer[2]> You still here LukeNukem?
[00:24:57] <tw2113> the girls always go for the quirky guy
[00:25:01] <sviatovigt> Cork: could you be more explicit please?
[00:25:46] <Cork> $('parent').on('click', '.objects', function() { window[$(this).data('handler')](this); });
[00:25:51] <Cork> sviatovigt: or something like that
[00:26:03] <sviatovigt> hmmm
[00:26:16] <Cork> replace window with another object if you don't want to polute the global scope
[00:26:20] <sviatovigt> that code seems out of my league at this moment
[00:26:29] <sviatovigt> I will try it though
[00:26:36] <sviatovigt> to see what happens
[00:26:45] <sviatovigt> Cork: but I do not understand
[00:26:45] <Cork> var handlers = { something:function() {} };$('parent').on('click', '.objects', function() handlers[$(this).data('handler')](this); });
[00:27:20] <Cork> <elm class="objects" data-handler="something"></elm>
[00:27:26] <sviatovigt> Cork: for example, in my page, I have buttons having the ids: button-x1, button-x2, button-x3.... and so on
[00:27:52] <sviatovigt> Cork: how do I write an listner that will be triggered when I click one of those buttons?
[00:28:01] <Cork> sviatovigt: add a class to them
[00:28:21] <Cork> when your writing generic handlers you never want to use id's
[00:28:28] <sviatovigt> ok
[00:28:39] <tw2113> classes are reusable
[00:28:47] <Cork> yup
[00:29:07] <sviatovigt> this is what gets me confused, that they are reusable...
[00:29:12] <sviatovigt> I will try that
[00:29:46] <Cork> sviatovigt: thats the major difference between id's and classes, id's reprecent one explisilty one element
[00:29:52] <Cork> a class and reprecent many
[00:31:08] <StevenCodes22> suppers
[00:31:15] <StevenCodes22> is for the dinner table
[00:31:16] <StevenCodes22> lmao
[00:33:07] <Shazer[2]> LukeNukem: you there?
[00:38:47] <optraz> i have a two level menu, when user point to the 2nd level menu, how do i tell level menu one stay there before it slide back?
[00:45:08] <john2x> not sure if this is the right place to ask this.. in Twitter Bootstrap, how do I toggle a modal and at the same time toggle a specific tab inside that modal?
[00:47:00] <LukeNukem> sviatovigt, i wasn't here, hope you fixed your problem
[00:47:11] <sviatovigt> yes, I had
[00:47:18] <sviatovigt> thank you for your help
[00:48:17] <LukeNukem> also you cant use variables you defined inside a function, outside of it.
[00:53:21] <jomofcw> right or wrong : $(data) doesn't create a new document ? So it is "attach" to the current document ? So if there is two #ID, it invalid the  current doc ?
[00:55:05] <blackspotwiggins> ?source is
[00:55:06] <bot-t> Line#5263 - "is: function( selector ) { return !!selector && ( typeof selector === "string" ? jQuery.filter( selector, this ).length > 0 : this.filter( selector ).length > 0 ); }" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#5263
[00:59:43] <jomofcw> ?source ajax
[00:59:44] <bot-t> Line#7060 - "ajax: function( url, options ) {" - http://bot-t.com/jquery.js#7060
[01:00:26] <fatninja> how to post a form into a new formatted window , like 500px x 500px ?
[01:00:49] <fatninja> I know about target="_blank" , but that opens it in a new full window
[01:01:07] <Cork> fatninja: new formated window?
[01:01:14] <Cork> you mean a jquery-ui dialog?
[01:01:17] <Cork> or what?
[01:01:30] <fatninja> Cork : sorry , I mean like , a new window that has 500px width and 500px height.
[01:01:54] <Cork> fatninja: you can't
[01:02:04] <Cork> you can't post to a popup
[01:02:06] <fatninja> hehe, that's what I thought..
[01:02:16] <Cork> window.open('url')
[01:02:35] <Cork> you could generate a get url though
[01:02:36] <fatninja> yes, you are right, my only way is ajax and some php session handling
[01:03:09] <Cork> fatninja: the problem will be to open the popup without triggering browsers blockers
[01:03:28] <aqeel> hi room
[01:04:13] <fatninja> pop-up blockers do not scream when a popup is opened on 'onclick' trigger
[01:04:22] <Cork> ya
[01:04:34] <Cork> but you won't be in an onclick after an ajax call
[01:04:38] <Cork> that was my point
[01:05:33] <fatninja> the point was that ajax was posting to a php, that php put what it got into a session, opened then the url (which has a php that got everything back out from the session) and worked with it
[01:05:56] <fatninja> oh wait
[01:06:05] <fatninja> if you make an ajax call onclick
[01:06:15] <fatninja> you won't be in on click ?
[01:06:20] <Cork> then your out of the onclick when your in the success function
[01:06:27] <Cork> nope
[01:07:10] <fatninja> that's true… hmm
[01:07:21] <Cork> fatninja: the reason i mention it is cause i've been there and fought with it my self a while back
[01:16:35] <LukeNukem> Cork, say i have two divs with the same class but different id
[01:16:42] <LukeNukem> i need to figure out the id of the last div
[01:17:27] <LukeNukem> <div id='1' class='mydiv'>hehe</div> <div id='2' class='LOOOL'>hehe</div> <div id='3' class='mydiv'>ROFLWTF</div>
[01:17:38] <LukeNukem> how can i grab the id of the last existing div
[01:18:04] <Eviltwin> .find("div").last().attr("id") ?
[01:18:39] <LukeNukem> ok ty
[01:19:22] <LukeNukem> evident, $.find?
[01:19:38] <Eviltwin> How new are you to jQuery?
[01:19:49] <LukeNukem> wait, just confused
[01:20:26] <aqeel> ok for media interface in 3d should i go html or flash way?
[01:22:33] <JKarsrud> hmm, how does jQuery resolve the tag name internally when using .is()?
[01:23:10] <JKarsrud> does it use tagName or nodeName? Or does it simply check the length of a getElementsByTagName?
[01:23:10] <Eviltwin> If I recall correctly, it does a .filter and checks that there are elements in the resulting collection
[01:23:29] <aqeel> can jquery handle 3d stuff?
[01:23:54] <JKarsrud> Eviltwin: hmm, right you are, but what does filter do then? :P
[01:24:15] <Eviltwin> Uses Sizzle
[01:24:41] <JKarsrud> aight, uses nodeType and nodeName
[01:24:50] <JKarsrud> that's what I thought
[01:27:07] <jomofcw> I can't post anything on the jquery support forum... why ?!
[01:27:19] <Eviltwin> Poor punctuation
[01:27:56] <sviatovigt> how can I move an element in the page?
[01:28:30] <Eviltwin> Are you referring to CSS positioning or DOM location
[01:28:31] <Cork> sviatovigt: make it position: absolute and set css top/left
[01:28:32] <jomofcw> sviatovigt each manipulation method will move the element
[01:28:34] <Cork> or margin
[01:28:43] <arvidkahl> yeah evil, same thought here
[01:28:44] <jomofcw> +1 Cork
[01:28:49] <jomofcw> I missunderstood the question ^^.
[01:29:14] <sviatovigt> I have a preloader that is hidden and I will like to move it right at the top of the element that has an ajax request
[01:29:36] <Cork> sviatovigt: elements don't have ajax requests :)
[01:29:42] <arvidkahl> interesting :D
[01:29:55] <Cork> ajax can be called from an event listner that listens on an element
[01:29:58] <sviatovigt> Cork: :) yes, sorry, my explanation was poor
[01:30:10] <sviatovigt> yes
[01:30:11] <sviatovigt> :)
[01:30:12] <arvidkahl> show, don't tell :P
[01:35:04] <Shazer[2]> How do i clear a text inputin javascript?
[01:35:16] <Shazer[2]> I tried $("#todoText").value = "";
[01:36:00] <Cork> ?.val @ Shazer[2]
[01:36:00] <xec> Shazer[2]: .val("") maybe?
[01:36:01] <bot-t> Shazer[2], .val(): Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/val/
[01:36:49] <Shazer[2]> Thanks xec.
[01:36:51] <Shazer[2]> And Cork.
[01:37:15] <Shazer[2]> However, that didn't work.
[01:37:37] <Cork> where are you calling it from ?
[01:38:40] <Shazer[2]> When I submit a form, Cork.
[01:39:01] <Cork> $("#todoText").length is > 0 ?
[01:39:42] <Shazer[2]> Yes.
[01:39:42] <jomofcw> I can't post anything on the jquery support forum... why ?!
[01:39:43] <Shazer[2]> Cork, http://pastie.org/3470361
[01:39:49] <Shazer[2]> Not logged in, jomofcw?
[01:39:51] <Shazer[2]> Banned?
[01:40:57] <Cork> Shazer[2]: no
[01:41:16] <Cork> i meant does $("#todoText").length indicate that jquery found the element
[01:41:23] <Cork> not the length of val
[01:41:40] <Shazer[2]> What?
[01:41:55] <Cork> console.log($("#todoText").length)
[01:42:00] <Cork> what does that say?
[01:42:17] <Shazer[2]> Cork
[01:42:21] <Shazer[2]> I was meant to post this code
[01:42:21] <Shazer[2]> http://pastebin.com/VWVKfBNH
[01:42:41] <Cork> its still the same question
[01:42:57] <Cork> what does console.log($("#todoText").length) say if you run it along side row 3
[01:43:13] <Cork> or wait
[01:43:20] <Shazer[2]> Cork, that was the wrong code too.
[01:43:21] <Shazer[2]> http://pastebin.com/YWJEs0ur
[01:43:22] <Cork> its line 6 that doesn't work?
[01:43:27] <xec> there's also a function on line 5 that doesnt seem to end
[01:43:29] <Cork> ...
[01:43:42] <xec> right
[01:43:46] <klawd> hi!
[01:43:56] <Shazer[2]> xec, yeah.
[01:43:57] <Shazer[2]> Sorry.
[01:44:00] <Shazer[2]> I forgot to fix that
[01:44:04] <Shazer[2]> Remove the parenthesis and semi-colon.
[01:44:10] <xec> Shazer[2]: could you post markup as well, at jsfiddle.net
[01:44:11] <klawd> i have a .click on a submit button. now when i submit that form, it doesn't send the submit button in the POST anymore. how can i fix that?
[01:44:55] <Cork> Shazer[2]: oook, so does jquey find the $("#item3") ?
[01:45:58] <Shazer[2]> Yes.
[01:46:03] <Shazer[2]> http://jsfiddle.net/s8tcv/
[01:46:41] <Shazer[2]> Doesn't seem to work on there.
[01:46:56] <sviatovigt> regarding my previous question, what I want is basically something similar with copy/paste of an element
[01:46:56] <Cork> wfm >_>
[01:47:12] <sviatovigt> how could I do that?
[01:47:16] <Cork> oh wait mootols >__<
[01:47:56] <Cork> sviatovigt: your sure you want to have #item3 there?
[01:48:03] <Cork> looks to me your using the wrong id
[01:48:17] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/s8tcv/1/
[01:48:43] <sviatovigt> Cork: you are probably addressing to Shazer[2]
[01:48:55] <sviatovigt> that code is not mine
[01:48:56] <Cork> sviatovigt: correct, sorry :x
[01:49:03] <sviatovigt> np
[01:49:04] <Cork> Shazer[2]: ^
[01:49:11] <Shazer[2]> No?
[01:49:18] <Shazer[2]> I am using the right ID aren't I?
[01:49:20] <jomofcw> Shazer[2] I'm logged in :/. And I don't think I'm banned...
[01:49:22] <sviatovigt> do you have any suggestion to my question as well?
[01:49:27] <Cork> Shazer[2]: li doesn't have value
[01:49:29] <LukeNukem> var lastitem = $(".mylist").last().attr("id");
[01:50:07] <Shazer[2]> o.O
[01:50:15] <jomofcw> I've got just one post : http://forum.jquery.com/topic/ui-button-and-ui-dialog-buttons-doesn-t-work-on-the-same-way and I could reply to any, but I can't post a new one.
[01:50:34] <LukeNukem_> var lastitem = $(".mylist").last().attr("id");
[01:50:38] <Shazer[2]> My code is the same as yours Cork, but yours works mine doesn't.
[01:50:39] <LukeNukem_> how can i hook that up with .live?
[01:50:46] <Cork> sviatovigt: some browsers support oncopy/oncut/onpaste
[01:50:56] <NodeX> LukeNukem ?
[01:51:01] <Cork> Shazer[2]: your original code isn't the same as mine
[01:51:09] <LukeNukem_> Cork, show me the code please?
[01:51:23] <Cork> Shazer[2]: $("#item3").val(""); vs $("#todoText").val("");
[01:51:47] <Cork> you tried to reset value="" on <li id="item3">
[01:51:52] <Cork> and it doesn't have value
[01:51:55] <Shazer[2]> OH
[01:51:57] <Shazer[2]> I get it.
[01:52:00] <Shazer[2]> oops.
[01:52:03] <_ramo> hi
[01:52:10] <Shazer[2]> Embarassing.
[01:52:11] <Cork> and ontop of that your not interested in that element anyway :)
[01:52:30] <Shazer[2]> Thanks Cork.
[01:52:30] <Shazer[2]> Why?
[01:52:40] <LukeNukem_> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/zWgev/45/
[01:52:49] <Cork> LukeNukem: uh.. hook it up to live?
[01:52:56] <_ramo> how can i achieve, that all pictures on my website get an overlay if i hover them ? i would like to have an overlay with buttons on that overly, so that i can click it, and for this specific image the action is done ?
[01:53:04] <LukeNukem_> i wrote that for Shazer[2] it does not work for him
[01:53:09] <LukeNukem_> he probably did something wrong
[01:53:37] <Cork> LukeNukem: as we just found it was a use of the wrong id on one place
[01:53:46] <NodeX> if you have jquery 1.7 you are better to use on()
[01:54:14] <Cork> Shazer[2]: what i meant from what the code looks like your interested in the input field, thats what i meant
[01:54:15] <LukeNukem_> Cork, eh wrong id?
[01:54:17] <LukeNukem_> da fuq?
[01:56:28] <LukeNukem_> NodeX, well either .on or .live the code breaks
[01:56:29] <LukeNukem_> :\
[01:57:34] <NodeX> what is the code
[01:59:14] <NodeX> ?on
[01:59:15] <bot-t> .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:00:01] * tocka labas
[02:00:13] <LukeNukem_> http://jsfiddle.net/zWgev/47/
[02:00:42] <NodeX> and what specificaly breaks
[02:03:33] <LukeNukem_> no idea, the code does not work after i use .live or .on
[02:04:33] <NodeX> it works for me wiht on
[02:04:36] <Cork> LukeNukem_: you mean live on submit?
[02:04:43] <Cork> or live on?
[02:04:45] <Cork> what?
[02:05:04] <NodeX> and "no idea" is very very vague
[02:05:09] <Cork> heh ya :)
[02:05:32] <LukeNukem_> NodeX, code please
[02:05:47] <Cork> LukeNukem_: btw why are you constructing it so much around id's?
[02:06:07] <fof> your fiddle works fine with on, have a look at that?
[02:06:19] <Cork> $(this).closest('form').before would do the same thing
[02:06:41] <NodeX> code please what ?
[02:07:08] <NodeX> *confused*
[02:07:23] <LukeNukem_> need to add .on to $(".mylist").last().attr("id");
[02:07:33] <Cork> but thats not an event
[02:07:39] <Cork> so how would you add on to that?
[02:07:48] <LukeNukem_> http://jsfiddle.net/zWgev/47/
[02:08:17] <LukeNukem_> try it, it says last item is 2
[02:08:29] <LukeNukem_> after i submit, after second submit it still says 2..it must say 3
[02:08:31] <LukeNukem_> s
[02:08:31] <LukeNukem_> :s*
[02:08:52] <NodeX> right I get you now
[02:09:24] <fof> that's because you're inserting rather than appending?
[02:09:29] <Cork> LukeNukem_: but it is the last "listitem"
[02:09:35] <NodeX> the "on" isn't live because it's loaded once and the funciton for it is inside the handler
[02:09:38] <Cork> LukeNukem_: your adding myitem's
[02:09:55] <NodeX> and that also
[02:10:08] <NodeX> on() describes an event as Cork said ^^
[02:10:08] <fof> oops it's not the index of last added, ignore me
[02:10:16] <Cork> $(".mylist, .myitem").last().attr("id")
[02:10:30] <Cork> should give you what your after
[02:11:02] <NodeX> quick tip also .. use filter(":last") ... it's much faster
[02:11:12] <Cork> its not
[02:11:15] <NodeX> it uses native where possible
[02:11:32] <NodeX> I guess J Reisig is wrong then lol
[02:11:49] <Cork> ":last" is a sizzle call to .last
[02:12:00] <tankblergh> hi guys. Any reason why change on a selected option shouldnt work?"...find('select option:selected').change(function ()..."
[02:12:01] <Cork> so it only runs through sizzle to call the same function
[02:12:11] <tankblergh> or does that have a chance
[02:12:36] <Cork> tankblergh: option doesn't have change
[02:12:37] <LukeNukem_> .myitem
[02:12:38] <LukeNukem_> wtf?
[02:12:43] <Cork> its select that have them
[02:12:49] <tankblergh> aha!
[02:12:52] <tankblergh> thanks
[02:12:58] <LukeNukem_> i dont have myitem
[02:12:59] <hurry> can i do unload of the page, that this page load with .load() ?
[02:13:00] <LukeNukem_> -_-
[02:13:20] <Cork> LukeNukem_: $("#"+lastitem).after("<li id='"+newitem+"' class='myitem'>"+content+"</li>");
[02:13:23] <Cork> yes you do
[02:13:45] <LukeNukem_> oh lol
[02:13:45] <LukeNukem_> i see it now
[02:13:45] <LukeNukem_> ok
[02:14:55] <tankblergh> that worked perfecty, thanks, Cork
[02:15:12] <LukeNukem_> ok that work
[02:21:22] <diverdude> How do i get the domain from a url in jquery?
[02:23:06] <Cork> diverdude: regex
[02:25:50] <Cork> diverdude: the only thing javascript offeres when it comes to spliting urls, its for the current domain (though window.location.*
[02:25:51] <Cork> )
[02:26:12] <Cork> s/current domain/current url/
[02:27:48] <diverdude> ok, thx
[02:28:39] <mrHat> ok, using '$.post' how can i post the selected radio button and keep the index array. The post output should look like this: radiox[3]=radiovalue . I'm currently getting radiox=radiovalue without the index
[02:29:13] <NodeX> serialize it
[02:29:19] <mrHat> $.post(url, { 'rating[ratingIndex]': ratingVal .... dose'nt work
[02:29:25] <mrHat> sorry
[02:29:33] <mrHat> $.post(url, { 'rating['+ratingIndex+']': ratingVal .... dose'nt work
[02:29:35] <mrHat> like this
[02:29:43] <mrHat> but it's stupid i know
[02:30:05] <Cork> data: { rating: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] }
[02:30:07] <mrHat> i can't work it out on the server side as i dont have access to the script im posint
[02:30:10] <Cork> is prob what your looking for
[02:30:11] <mrHat> posting
[02:30:14] <mrHat> so
[02:30:45] <mrHat> ?
[02:31:09] <Cork> jquery converts { rating: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] } to rating[]=1&rating[]=2&rating[]=3&rating[]=4&rating[]=5&rating[]=6&rating[]=7
[02:31:39] <NodeX> I think he wants rating[key]=val
[02:31:49] <mrHat> yeah
[02:31:53] <mrHat> exactly
[02:32:11] <NodeX> I tend to just serliaze the form and it takes care of it for me
[02:32:22] <NodeX> serialize *
[02:32:33] <Cork> not really if you want to send all options selected or not
[02:32:43] <NodeX> why send not selected lol
[02:33:08] <NodeX> semantics anyway which is down to the developer
[02:33:40] <Cork> mrHat: but {'rating[ratingIndex]': ratingVal} should work
[02:33:55] <Cork> as long as the server code can actually parse that
[02:34:18] <Cork> and that differ quite a bit from server language to serverlanguage
[02:34:38] <mrHat> Cork that dosent work
[02:34:54] <mrHat> ratingIndex will be threated as string
[02:35:08] <Cork> ah sorry
[02:35:26] <Cork> mrHat: i meant {'rating['+ ratingIndex +']': ratingVal}
[02:35:34] <Cork> uggg....
[02:35:39] <Cork> no that won't work
[02:35:45] <Cork> that won't parse
[02:35:57] <NodeX> you need to cretae the json key outside the {}
[02:36:00] <NodeX> create*
[02:36:24] <NodeX> infact the whole Json object needs to be created outside of the {}
[02:36:27] <Cork> var params = {}; params['rating['+ ratingIndex +']'] = ratingVal;
[02:36:32] <NodeX> like that ^^
[02:36:36] <Cork> NodeX: its not json
[02:36:52] <NodeX> so things inside {} are not json ?
[02:37:00] <NodeX> json object **
[02:37:09] <Cork> { "key":"val" } is a javascript object
[02:37:16] <Cork> '{ "key":"val" }' is json
[02:37:23] <NodeX> object *
[02:37:27] <Cork> json is a string
[02:37:36] <NodeX> it's how I say things
[02:37:50] <Cork> well its wrong
[02:38:00] <NodeX> mebbe for you but I know what I mean ;)
[02:38:06] <Cork> you can't refer members of json
[02:38:19] <Cork> NodeX: cause i saw the code ya
[02:38:34] <Cork> else i would have though your meant something else
[02:39:32] <NodeX> "your meant something else" is also wrong but I know what you meant
[02:39:35] <NodeX> semantics ;)
[02:40:25] <Cork> NodeX: you can give post json, and it will send it as json instead of params
[02:40:42] <Cork> so it has a big difference in meaning
[02:41:18] <NodeX> yes for everyone else
[02:41:21] <mrHat> finally
[02:41:22] <mrHat> haha
[02:41:22] <NodeX> but I know what I meant lol
[02:41:29] <mrHat> what to do
[02:41:36] <NodeX> I do know the difference between '{}' and {}
[02:41:48] <NodeX> I do mix how people say things up alot
[02:41:50] <Cork> mrHat: like i said: var params = {}; params['rating['+ ratingIndex +']'] = ratingVal;
[02:42:02] <Cork> then use params in the post
[02:42:22] <Cork> mrHat: or just use jquerys serialize and it should solve it for you
[02:42:24] <mrHat> for all post variables ?
[02:42:52] <Cork> mrHat: all where the key has to be dynamic
[02:43:01] <Cork> the rest can be set in the var params = {};
[02:43:48] <NodeX> var dataString=$(yourForm).serialize(); .... $.post(URL,datastring,function(data){...});
[02:44:04] <NodeX> $.post(URL,dataString,function(data){...});
[02:44:18] <NodeX> and it'll all be done for you
[02:45:43] <mrHat> NodeX : that will pass ALL form data ?
[02:45:56] <Cork> if you use form, yes
[02:46:06] <Cork> or you can do a selector for a few form elements
[02:46:14] <Cork> and it will only use them
[02:46:28] <NodeX> it will basicaly get the form and put it into an object for you to do what you like with
[02:46:37] <Cork> $('input[name^="some"]').serialize()
[02:46:53] <Cork> NodeX: no serialize makes a param string
[02:47:17] <Cork> serializeArray makes an array, and thats the closest jquery offer
[02:47:41] <NodeX> by object I mean the params
[02:47:48] <Cork> ...
[02:47:52] <NodeX> I hate Mondays
[02:49:28] <mrHat> Cork i think you are right
[02:54:05] <mrHat> NodeX is right as well
[02:54:15] <mrHat> seams like serializing data has done the whole job
[02:54:22] <mrHat> cleaner and less code (i guess)
[02:54:46] <Xraz> Anyone familiar with ajax/pjax?  Without using it, my jQuery for showing/hiding various parts of a form fires up fire, but when fetching the form via ajax/pjax, it doesn't fire (presumably there isn't a document.ready being hit?  Anyone know a quick way to resolve this in coffeescript/ javascript?
[02:55:05] <Xraz> (or a load event maybe)
[02:56:52] <burzum> hi
[02:57:42] <burzum> whats wrong here? http://pastebin.com/2NyBEv9s my response status is 200, the responseText is "ok" but only the "complete" callback is fired. any ideas why? :(
[02:58:30] <Cork> burzum: check so your json validates
[02:58:35] <NodeX> malformed json?
[02:58:39] <Cork> its a common cause
[02:58:45] <burzum> Cork, ive already done this and it works
[02:59:16] <burzum> ive validated it here http://jsonlint.com/
[02:59:20] <Cork> wait a min
[02:59:25] <Cork> callback
[02:59:28] <Cork> your using jsonp?
[02:59:34] <ravenzz> is the mime type correct?
[02:59:57] <Cork> burzum: if your using ?callback=? you shouldn't return json
[03:00:03] <Cork> it should be js with a function
[03:00:15] <burzum> Cork oh, let me try that
[03:00:17] <Cork> named after the callback param jquery sends
[03:00:35] <Cork> burzum: but if its on the same server you NEVER want to use jsonp
[03:00:46] <ravenzz> why?
[03:00:51] <ravenzz> oh well
[03:00:52] <burzum> ah crap, that was it... im not doing a cross domain request
[03:00:54] <Cork> cuse its insecure
[03:00:55] <ravenzz> json
[03:01:02] <ravenzz> you don't need to be P
[03:01:04] <Cork> and if you'r not forced to use it, don't
[03:01:50] <burzum> yes, totally my fault
[03:02:19] <burzum> thanks for your help!
[03:02:43] <impulse9> hi, how can i make a selector that activates only when i click on a div itself, but not on <a> elements inside it?
[03:02:56] <impulse9> now when i click the link both actions occur
[03:03:04] <ravenzz> ?stoppropagation @ impulse9
[03:03:04] <bot-t> impulse9, event.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, preventing any parent handlers from being notified of the event. http://api.jquery.com/event.stopPropagation/
[03:03:25] <Cork> impulse9: check event.target === this
[03:03:44] <Cork> or ya, stopPropagation
[03:04:01] <Cork> but stopPropagation would have to be on every element you want to exclude
[03:04:15] <impulse9> but i don't want to exclude the element
[03:04:17] <impulse9> i want it to work
[03:04:28] <impulse9> but if it's clicked i don't want the jquery on click() event fire as well
[03:04:41] <Cork> impulse9: thats the propagation
[03:04:53] <Cork> when you click an element, the click propagates up the tree
[03:05:03] <Cork> unless you do stopPropagation()
[03:05:42] <Cork> impulse9: so you can either do event.target on the click even, and filter it out there
[03:05:51] <diverdude> when writing jquery plugin, you have to do return this.each(function() {} in the end...but what does the each function actually return and is it necessary to have that each llop?
[03:05:55] <Cork> or use stopPropagation() on the elements you want to exclude
[03:05:58] <impulse9> if i understand correctly, stopPropagation should only be called on the child element itself then?
[03:06:14] <impulse9> i'm a bit confused :>
[03:06:28] <Cork> impulse9: yes
[03:06:38] <Cork> you can bind a click event on the links
[03:06:47] <Cork> and in it run event.stopPropagation()
[03:07:00] <Cork> that will prevent the parent div know getting notified about clicks on them
[03:07:19] <Cork> diverdude: it loops over each element found by the selector
[03:07:35] <Cork> and it returns the same thing you get with $('sel').each
[03:07:39] <impulse9> it works
[03:07:39] <Cork> so the dom element
[03:07:44] <impulse9> thanks a lot for help
[03:09:10] <diverdude> Cork: so actually its not necessary to return anything?
[03:11:00] <Cork> no
[03:11:20] <Cork> returning is actually an old and depricated of managing events
[03:11:29] <Cork> *way of*
[03:37:30] <Xotix> How can i get the input for my contenteditable div? So i can filter it. Everything, pasted stuff, written stuff. Is there some input event i can use?
[03:38:18] <mlechner> hi, how to get the position of an element in a sortable() list?
[03:38:49] <pyromilkz> Hello is there any event that's fired when clicking, or hitting enter, or space?
[03:39:28] <Xotix> keypress()
[03:39:59] <pyromilkz> Xotix, is there a keycode for the mouse button?
[03:40:10] <Xotix> alert it
[03:40:19] <Xotix> idk if keypress includes the mouse
[03:40:51] <sayyestolife> I'm doing around 20-50 different selections using $('[id^="foo"][id*="baz"]') and they are very fast in Chrome & FF (around 20 ms) but they are very slow in IE (around 500 ms). Is there a faster way of doing this kind of selection in IE?
[03:40:53] <pyromilkz> Xotix, I'll check
[03:41:19] <pyromilkz> Xotix, I was asking if an event exists so I don't user keypress and start checking using keycodes
[03:43:29] <Xotix> pyromilkz:  hmm i don't knwo if there are specific events for enter and leftMouse. For enter, I'm doing keyress(function(e) {if(e.which == 12)})
[03:43:43] <Xotix> *13$
[03:46:03] <PeterB> I'm struggling with basic DOM traversal - what can I use in http://jsbin.com/uwicuh/edit#javascript,html,live instead of find() please?
[03:47:51] <pyromilkz> Thanks Xotix, this will be fine! :)
[03:48:19] <Xotix> pyromilkz: you don't need the keypress, you just can pass e on your function and use e.which
[03:49:00] <Orbit> Guys difference between using context and find? using context seems faster http://jsperf.com/jquery-find-vs-context-vs-sizzle
[03:49:17] <nFFF> Orbit, context uses find
[03:49:29] <Guest47062> so I should sue find?
[03:49:32] <Guest47062> use
[03:49:51] <nFFF> $('.foo', bar) === $(bar).find('.foo')
[03:50:14] <Guest47062> and according to this find seems slower
[03:50:16] <Guest47062> http://jsperf.com/jquery-find-vs-context-vs-sizzle
[03:51:11] <nFFF> No it doesn;'t
[03:52:03] <nFFF> That url shows find faster...
[03:52:30] <Guest47062> ou sorry ok thats operation/ second
[03:53:12] <nFFF> There virtually the same in terms of speed
[03:53:19] <Guest47062> So why should I use context?
[03:53:20] <nFFF> It resolves to the same method
[03:57:00] <sayyestolife> This selector  $('[id^="foo"][id*="baz"]') is very slow on IE, any ideas on how to optimize?
[03:57:42] <HardFu_> I have an image with link on my site. On top of the image, there is a svg with some anchors. How can I prevent both events executing when I click on an anchor inside the SVG?
[03:59:45] <fof> PeterB: how's this? http://jsfiddle.net/HUC5S/
[04:01:00] <Xotix> http://jsfiddle.net/nQmEA/ i have a contenteditable div, i've disabled the writing into it by returning false; but i think this isn't really "disabling" it. Anyway, i would like to return e.g. "Test". So on each keypress it writes test to the div. I could append(); but this also looks not really good. Any ideas? I would like to filter the input "stream".
[04:01:02] <HardFu_> http://www.unidrain.se/konsument/  here is the problem
[04:01:13] <HardFu_> if i click on a circle, both events trigger
[04:01:18] <PeterB> fof: I'm trying to find a way without find() tho, as I understand that'll be more performant
[04:03:05] <fof> honestly dont know how the performance compares but you could also do this http://jsfiddle.net/HUC5S/2/
[04:03:15] <fof> others will be more help :)
[04:05:23] <Guest12916> Can you use jquery to provide client side functioanltiy?
[04:05:40] <Guest12916> I already use PHP for that, but  I'm thinking of using jQuery instead.
[04:05:50] <Cork> uh client side?
[04:05:55] <StevenCodes22> ummm
[04:05:58] <Cork> php run server side
[04:06:08] <Guest12916> Cork: No?
[04:06:16] <Guest12916> It shows up on the client bro.
[04:06:18] <fof> ignore Guest12916, he was trolling last wekk too
[04:06:32] <Cork> ah
[04:07:34] <fof> sorry PeterB, more in line with original http://jsfiddle.net/HUC5S/3/
[04:07:47] <Guest12916> fof: ?
[04:12:09] <fof> that was also bad, http://jsfiddle.net/HUC5S/4/ , anyway peter i recommend jqfundamentals.com for a good guide
[04:13:12] <Guest12916> What's a nice lookign toast plugin?
[04:14:03] <fof> http://jqfundamentals.com/#chapter-9 > optimize selectors
[04:21:38] <jlebrech> i'm trying to add a tag to a list like this $("ul.tags").append("li").append("a").value(ui.item.value)
[04:22:10] <jlebrech> i need to append <li><a>blah</a></li> to the selector
[04:22:50] <Guest47062> Guest12916 php is server side, php code does not show up on clients side, it is executed on server side and result (in form of html, javascript, css etc) is send to client to show it. Javascript is executed on client side inside of his browser(in general)
[05:01:53] <IamTrying> var t =  ($(this).val() != NaN()) ? 0 : $(this).val();  // its NaN but why its not show as 0 ?
[05:02:06] <WHK> Helo
[05:02:16] <WHK> a question please
[05:02:58] <WHK> the funcion empty() delete all handlers of objects?
[05:03:11] <WHK> for example...
[05:04:00] <WHK> <div id="a"><div id="b"></div></div> ... $('#b').click(function(){ alert(0); }); $('#a').empty();
[05:04:00] <Cork> WHK: events are added to the dom through addEventListner
[05:04:14] <Cork> so the browser handles removing them when it cleans up the dom tree
[05:04:21] <WHK> the empty() remove click event of memory?
[05:04:26] <WHK> ooh
[05:05:34] <mattfieldy> empty() removes event handlers from the child elements before removing the elements themselves
[05:05:43] <WHK> Thanks :)
[05:08:26] <WHK> if have: <div id="a"><div id="b"></div></div> ... $('#b').click(function(){ alert(0); }); $('#a').html('test');... remove handlers?
[05:08:35] <WHK> :-s
[05:11:44] <mattfieldy> Are you asking how you would remove the click handler from div#b?
[05:13:09] <Cork> WHK: as soon as the element is removed the browser takes care of removing handles
[05:13:18] <Cork> doens't matter if you replace them or not
[05:14:26] <Cork> WHK: or if you prefer the tecnical answer is; when the browser doesn't find any variable has a reference to an elemnet its removed, and along with it all the attached events
[05:14:28] <mattfieldy> WHK: Are you trying to remove just the event handler from the element or remove the element entirely?
[05:14:42] <Cork> WHK: if you use delegate or live though, they arn't removed
[05:15:02] <Cork> mattfieldy: its a question about what happens with events on dom manipulation
[05:15:10] <Cork> mattfieldy: not about how to remove the events
[05:16:00] <mattfieldy> Understood. Perhaps I misunderstood the question.
[05:23:06] <tocka> What is the difference when you call a function by jQuery and when you call by $ ?
[05:27:05] <WHK> Thanks
[05:27:08] <WHK> mmm...
[05:27:11] <WHK> spanish? xD
[05:27:22] <WHK> i have multiples divs
[05:27:32] <WHK> and each div remplace DOM
[05:27:47] <WHK> wath happen white DOM
[05:27:59] <WHK> mmm
[05:28:26] <WHK> <div id="central_container"> ... </div>
[05:28:50] <WHK> $.Ajax({.... remplace central_container with html()
[05:29:37] <WHK> function injectDOM(){ $('.botton').each(function(){ $(this).click(...
[05:29:46] <WHK> for each Ajax success
[05:29:56] <WHK> and remplace content with html()
[05:30:06] <WHK> need empty() for remove handlers?
[05:31:04] <diverdude> if i have this on my page: $(function(){ $('#someid').myplugin() }; how do i at a later point call some public function in myplugin ?
[05:31:38] <diverdude> tocka: no difference
[05:31:58] <diverdude> tocka: is a shorthand symbol for jQuery

[05:39:20] <claudio> diverdude, http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[05:39:26] <claudio> aka IIFE
[05:40:57] <texinwien> is this channel the right place to discuss javascript unit testing with qunit?
[05:42:27] <jeffreylevesque> anyone have time, to help me refine my rotator: http://jsfiddle.net/zv4hM/22/.  I'm trying to add text area to this working rotator http://jsfiddle.net/zv4hM/19/
[05:52:09] <Wiz_KeeD> anyone know how to use jquerymobile dialogs?
[05:53:59] <diverdude> claudio: i see...so basically (function($){}})(jQuery); just invokes the function immedietly and sends JQuery as a parameter ?
[05:54:57] <claudio> diverdude, yes.
[05:55:04] <texinwien> sends jQuery in as a parameter, and jQuery is sent into the inner function as $
[05:55:19] <texinwien> so inside function () {}, $ = jQuery
[05:55:48] <diverdude> claudio: and why are we interested in invokiing the function immedietly when writing a jquery plugin?
[05:55:50] <claudio> diverdude, so in the function he can use "$" as jquery without worring about conflicts
[05:56:09] <claudio> diverdude, beacuse in that way no global objects are created
[05:56:27] <claudio> diverdude, and you're writing code in your own "scope"
[05:56:59] <diverdude> claudio: right i see...but still the plugin lives after it has been executed....because i can bind evens and such inside the plugin
[05:57:40] <diverdude> claudio: so some sort of global object is created no?
[05:57:40] <texinwien> this is a good article on Immediately Invoked Function Expressions: http://benalman.com/news/2010/11/immediately-invoked-function-expression/
[05:58:19] <claudio> texinwien, the same article I already pasted :)
[05:58:20] <diverdude> texinwien: yeah i just had a look at that one
[05:58:38] <texinwien> claudio - aha, just showed up in the room. hadn't seen your paste, claudio
[05:58:45] <texinwien> it's an excellent article on the topic
[05:58:45] <claudio> diverdude, created? No. Extended via the plugin architecture? yes :)
[05:59:07] <claudio> yes, it is. Ben Alman is really good
[05:59:23] <diverdude> because i am trying to figure out how i can somehow invoke a function in my plugin at a later time
[06:00:07] <diverdude> my plugin is created at document ready, but i need to invoke a function in that plugin when user clicks a button...using the state which was created at document ready
[06:00:12] <claudio> diverdude, $.myplugin("command") is very used as a paradigm to interact with pluging
[06:00:50] <claudio> *plugins
[06:01:38] <diverdude> claudio: i see...so as soon i have created my plugin, i can because of the $.fn.extend() at a later time invoke $.myplugin("command") ?
[06:03:28] <diverdude> hmm do i then still create the plugin using $('#someid').myplugin({parms}); ?
[06:04:48] <soee> hi, what would be the best way to achieve this: user picked some element from list, main content area visibility changes to 0.3 loading animation shows up above main content area, content is replaced via ajax and than main content area become fully visible again
[06:05:16] <claudio> diverdude, yes, why not? You can test if your parameter is a string (then is a command) or an object (than is the configuration)
[06:05:49] <diverdude> claudio: oh yes its a wonderful idea
[06:14:50] <diverdude> claudio: can i declare multiple function inside $.fn.extend({})? Like $.fn.extend({func1:function(parms){},func2:function(parms){},...,funcN:function(parms){}}); ? And will they all be globally accesable the bt using $.fn.func1(),$.fn.func2(),..., $.fn.func3() ?
[06:17:43] <diverdude> claudio: and do these functions share variables declared inside the (function($){})(jQuery); ?
[06:20:21] <xec> where can I find what classnames are used by jquery ui? specifically, i want to set a background color for droppables when dragging a draggable over it
[06:22:11] <diverdude> ahh yes...nice: http://jsfiddle.net/gNjbg/
[06:23:29] <diverdude> is it possible to create the jquery plugin without attaching it to a div?
[06:23:36] <diverdude> or any element for that matter
[06:23:53] <mspalmer1> Hey, I'm pulling out my hair trying to animate an accordian menu. Anybody mind giving me a hand?
[06:24:06] <xec> ?ask @ mspalmer1
[06:24:07] <bot-t> mspalmer1, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:25:01] <xec> mspalmer1: usually it helps to have a demo available that people can play with, show what you got so far
[06:25:36] <mspalmer1> How can I animate this menu so when Next is clicked the profile image moves over the current menu bringing up a new one: ]

[06:25:57] <diverdude> xec:  is it possible to create the jquery plugin without attaching it to a div or any element for that matter?
[06:26:10] <xec> diverdude: i'm not quite sure what you mean
[06:26:17] <mspalmer1> When Next is clicked it should look similar to this: http://decorgroupinc.com/test/archmouldings-builder/index2.html
[06:27:41] <diverdude> xec: like normally i have to do eg. $("#someelement").myplugin(); to create my plugin, can i somehow do it by just doing myplugin()? So not having to define some dummy element with id="someelement"?
[06:28:55] <xec> diverdude: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/jquery-use-my-plugin-fn-without-selector
[06:28:57] <Zogot> Why are you making it a jquery plugin if you dont want it attached to anything
[06:29:01] <xec> is that what you meant?
[06:29:02] <Zogot> you mean just a function?
[06:30:41] <diverdude> Zogot: well basically yeah i guess so...i just need some object which can control a lot of state variables and generate new DOM elements etc
[06:31:02] <diverdude> Zogot: and JQuery offers a lot of functionality
[06:31:04] <Zogot> Object Literal
[06:31:12] <Zogot> you mean structuring like an Object Literal*
[06:31:14] <Zogot> ?
[06:32:11] <Zogot> http://pastebin.com/ZBV6HEVV something like that. (an example i gave in a different channel earlier.  Didn't get a chance to test it or anything)
[06:32:13] <diverdude> Zogot: something which may be accessed from everywhere and can contain events, functions properties
[06:32:16] <Wiz_KeeD> you can do in javascript function(x,y=value) and can pass just function(x) right?
[06:32:25] <Zogot> diverdude: then yes an Object Literal
[06:33:31] <Zogot> To start the one I linked you would do $(document).ready(contact.ready);
[06:33:53] <diverdude> Zogot: yeah ok...nice
[06:34:10] <xec> mspalmer1: i'm not sure about the best way, but this seems to work: (see the button) http://jsfiddle.net/EMbsx/
[06:34:36] <Zogot> diverdude: http://groenkerk.nl/ you can see an example of a site using it
[06:34:52] <Zogot> the contact var also references the messages one
[06:35:51] <diverdude> Zogot: what messages?
[06:36:18] <Zogot> For example i have 2 objects, 1 for messages 1 for the contact form
[06:36:40] <Zogot> and from the var contact = {//blablabla} it references the message.success or message.failed
[06:37:47] <Zogot> exactly what your looking for if im understanding you correctly
[06:37:56] <Zogot> Also the contact references the scroll object if successful
[06:38:23] <jeffsmykil> I have a parameter that I'm trying to pass from one function to another called data.tagNumber, this variable always has decimals in it, is there something I need to do differently?  I keep getting an error
[06:38:47] <AayPizzle> Can you guys look at this jsFiddle real quick? http://jsfiddle.net/eP8qw/ For some reason the functionality of hide and fadeOut seems to be different in that when you fade something out, showing the parent element re-shows the child element that was faded out, yet if you hide the child element, then the show call on the parent element has no effect on that child. Is this intended?
[06:39:05] <jeffsmykil> can you not pass a variable with multiple decimal points in it?
[06:41:51] <jeffsmykil> it tells me [09:41:44.644] missing ) after argument list @ http://localhost/SkyView4/Modules/BioMed/EquipmentRecord.aspx?elementId=33:1
[06:42:13] <jeffsmykil> oops didnt mean to print al that
[06:43:15] <Zogot> AayPizzle: Its not applying fadeOut, I think because its parent isn't visible to the dom
[06:43:40] <Zogot> So in reality nothing is happening to #blah2 and when #blah1 is showing #blah2 is obviously there
[06:43:51] <Zogot> if you remove the display none from the css
[06:43:56] <Zogot> you will see it fadeOut correctly
[06:44:25] <Zogot> and apply a display:none style to the #blah2 element
[06:44:36] <jeffsmykil> if i take the parameter that holds the variable with multiple decimals out
[06:44:38] <jeffsmykil> it works fine
[06:44:46] <AayPizzle> Zogot: that makes sense, but should .hide() apply {display: none} to the hidden child element while .fadeOut() doesn't?
[06:45:24] <Zogot> I'm not sure why, but fadeOut sets the opacity down, and then applys none, maybe because it isn't viewable it can't animate the oppacity
[06:45:41] <djsounds02> http://kubeonedesign.co.uk/petfood/health-problems/   On this page I have slide toggle on my posts but they are all open anybody know how to start them closed?
[06:46:45] <Zogot> djsounds02: add display:none to the elements in css first
[06:46:49] <AayPizzle> Zogot: hmm... ok.
[06:46:50] <Zogot> and the toggle will show when clicked
[06:47:29] <Zogot> djsounds02: also set in the css html {overflow-y:scroll} to keep the scrollbar there to prevent jumping when opening/closing the boxes
[06:49:02] <djsounds02> Zogot: I think once I have put the rest of the content there it should auto be a longer page but thankyou
[06:51:25] <jeffsmykil> how do i pass a string with multiple decimal points in it?

[06:55:14] <FrEaKmAn_> I'm trying to add a click handler to a, which has 2 classes = "icon active"
[06:55:24] <FrEaKmAn_> how do I do it?
[06:55:43] <FrEaKmAn_> a.icon.active doesnt work...
[06:56:11] <jeffsmykil> a.icon active?
[06:56:25] <jeffsmykil> wait would that work
[06:56:27] <jeffsmykil> try that
[06:56:46] <FrEaKmAn_> jeffreylevesque, no...
[06:57:42] <jeffsmykil> you look at this FrEaKmAn_ http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[06:58:51] <FrEaKmAn_> jeffsmykil, a.icon.active should work.. but not for me..hm
[06:58:52] <dschuett> Can someone take a look and see why i'm getting the error: "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (" http://pastie.org/3472245
[06:59:15] <nFFF> a.icon .active
[06:59:44] <nFFF> a.icon.active*
[07:00:22] <FrEaKmAn_> nFFF, yeah.. but the problem is that I add class with addClass
[07:00:35] <FrEaKmAn_> and I guess jQuery doesnt catch it then
[07:00:38] <zfmf> does anyone know a plugin like this: http://m.friendfeed-media.com/55229534544c992a60c41e5a654911d2e441ef95

[07:01:25] <jeffsmykil> you need to do the live thing
[07:01:27] <varnie> how do I handle event when jquery ui slider popups?
[07:01:28] <jeffsmykil> what ever that is now

[07:02:01] <varnie> i.e. I have to perfrorm some specific logics when that slider closes.
[07:02:11] <nFFF> on won't work , as theres no class change event

[07:06:02] <twoface> Hi. I have a form in an iframe, that I submit by calling iframe.contents().find('form').submit(). If I have $('form').submit(function() { return false;}); inside the iframe, this event is never called. Can I work around that?
[07:08:19] <xec> mspalmer1: that's practically impossible to answer. we don't know what you're trying to do or how or what "screwing up" means in your case. there is too much code on that site to dig through. if you want help you should make a pared-down testcase, see ?demo
[07:08:19] <bot-t> mspalmer1, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:09:18] <mspalmer1> If you press Next it's pretty obious. I don't know how to explain it.
[07:09:27] <mspalmer1> What other information do you want me to include?
[07:09:57] <dschuett> would anyone be willing to take a look and see why i'm getting this error : "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token (" http://pastie.org/3472245
[07:10:31] <NodeX> what's the token
[07:10:54] <dschuett> NodeX: i don't know... that's all the error says
[07:11:13] <jita> I have a page where i have 2 jquery dialog boxes, which are hidden during document.ready. Now there is another form in the page, which i submit using jquery POST. Now the problem is whenever i POST the form data, and reload the division, the dialog forms show up. Any way to circumvent this problem ?
[07:11:23] <twoface> dschuett, "id: +id" is not valid, afaik
[07:11:54] <twoface> but more likely, it is because you include a ) on line 8
[07:12:15] <NodeX> what's the response from teh $.post
[07:12:40] <twoface> what am i thinking - ofcourse +id is valid...
[07:12:46] <varnie> is it possible to handle event when some div gets visible?
[07:13:53] <Mkop> +id is valid. closing an if statement with ); is not
[07:13:56] <dschuett> twoface: don't i need) on line 8 to close $.post( ?
[07:14:07] <xec> mspalmer1: i made you a working demo a moment ago, which has very little code - did you understand how it works?
[07:14:24] <Mkop> dschuett: for the love of god, indent your code properly
[07:14:39] <twoface> dschuett, yes - your indentation threw me off... you don't need the } on line 8, though
[07:15:05] <twoface> you do need it afterwards, to finish your if() though
[07:15:09] <Mkop> you also never close the if
[07:15:20] <Mkop> you would have noticed these mistakes if you indented properly
[07:15:57] <dschuett> twoface the } on line 8 closes the if statement
[07:16:11] <mspalmer1> xec: Yes, however this page doesn't have any headings which accordion needs to work. I tried using this method previously and I've been told it doesn't work in my case.
[07:16:26] <twoface> dschuett, you can't close your if() before you close your $.post()
[07:16:55] <twoface> }); should be );\n}
[07:16:59] <xec> mspalmer1: then make a small demo where you demonstrate what your code is doing, noone is going to dig through a site full of code

[07:18:56] <Mkop> jita: what do you mean "reload the division"?
[07:18:57] <dschuett> twoface: i think you're looking at it wrong (probably my indention), but the } closes the function that fades out the row. and the ) closes the post. then the next } closes the if

[07:23:07] <jita> Mkop, but is it a right way ?

[07:23:42] <Mkop> I'm confused as to why that would work
[07:24:11] <TC_> Having a small issue, lets say I had an iframe which loaded an remote site, eg: ebay.com, how would I process the esc command on the page that has the iframe? if i make sense.
[07:24:22] <TC_> I mean there is a .keup checking for the e.keyCode to be 27
[07:24:27] <jita> Mkop, i only want to update a certain division
[07:24:37] <jita> Mkop, not whole page after posting using ajax
[07:24:38] <TC_> but both window/document only work for the actual page, rather than ebay...
[07:25:19] <dddbmt> $('#form').submit() will invoke an "Access denied" error in IE if the form contains an <input type="file"> element. Any known workarounds for this?
[07:25:25] <twoface> TC_, and iframe.on('keyup' doesn't work?
[07:25:58] <TC_> I'll try, is there a way to do something like $("document, iframe") ?
[07:26:19] <Mkop> jita: do you mean  $('#table-content').replaceWith(data)?
[07:26:25] <twoface> $("document,#iframeid")
[07:26:54] <arvidkahl> dddbmt: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3935001/getting-access-is-denied-error-on-ie8   seems like it not really possible with js
[07:27:10] <jita> Mkop, it doesnt wor
[07:27:35] <Mkop> does data include the dialogs, or only the contents of the div you're trying to overwrite?
[07:27:43] <arvidkahl> dddbmt: security concern, looks like there is no workaround
[07:27:48] <TC_> it doesn't work for document, or the iframe for that matter
[07:29:22] <dddbmt> arvidkahl, that's too bad, but thanks anyway though! :)

[07:33:05] <Mkop> jita: are you trying to replace document's #sometable with data's #sometable?
[07:33:05] <jita> .load fills the division with the whole page that is returned by .post method
[07:33:11] <jita> Mkop, exactly

[07:34:09] <Mkop> search for "fragment" on that page
[07:34:23] <Mkop> or you can manipulate what you get from ajax

[07:40:58] <Mkop> jita: .load does not take a second parameter like that
[07:41:22] <Mkop> if you need that second parameter, use .post and the method I said of extracting what you need from the response
[07:41:23] <twoface> dschuett, why do you have that function() in line 2 anyway?
[07:47:23] <squeakytoy> Hey all. I have multiple inputs, and i want to run an ajax-validation after the user has entered something. Currently i have onkeyup, but that is for each character. Is there a better event i can use?
[07:47:42] <johnkpaul> squeakytoy: blur?
[07:47:45] <Jon47> squeakytoy you can bind to the "blur" event on the inputs
[07:47:50] <johnkpaul> ?blur
[07:47:51] <bot-t> .blur(handler): Bind an event handler to the "blur" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element. http://api.jquery.com/blur/
[07:47:51] <Jon47> or "change"..
[07:48:07] <squeakytoy> blur doesn't get triggered if they dont leave the input though?
[07:48:23] <johnkpaul> what does "after hte user has entered something" mean then
[07:48:53] <squeakytoy> technically or usability-wise? ;)
[07:49:01] <johnkpaul> to you
[07:49:05] <johnkpaul> what does it mean, to you
[07:49:07] <squeakytoy> technically its harder to figure out
[07:49:11] <johnkpaul> no, I mean, ideally
[07:49:20] <johnkpaul> if you could just tell it what to do, sans code, what would it be
[07:49:23] <squeakytoy> for me, is when the user has stopped entering information in the field.
[07:49:51] <squeakytoy> in my head, i was hoping jquery had a cool event that would be triggered if nothing has been entered for x time
[07:50:09] <Mkop> jquery doesn't have that, but you can build it without too much difficulty
[07:51:03] <squeakytoy> the problem with blur is that the validation gets triggered "after" they have left the input, which is stupid.
[07:51:18] <squeakytoy> it means the user will leave the input, get the message and focus it again..
[07:51:44] <johnkpaul> so squeakytoy, what you want is a keyup that waits a little bit?
[07:51:45] <Jon47> squeakytoy - how about making a plugin that handles keyup events for your inputs, and sets a timeout for executing the validation, if there is another keypress before the timeout expires, then clear the first timeout and create a new one
[07:51:56] <johnkpaul> yeah, I agree with Jon47
[07:52:15] <Jon47> maybe also clear the timeout if the user blurs the input, if you think that's good UI
[07:52:39] <Jon47> er.. UX, whatever
[07:52:39] <squeakytoy> puuuuuh, do it myself? :(
[07:52:43] <Jon47> haha
[07:52:58] <johnkpaul> squeakytoy: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Validation
[07:53:01] <squeakytoy> i clearly can't be the first developer asking for this feature ;)
[07:53:03] <johnkpaul> read through that a
[07:53:05] <Jon47> ARE YOU A MAN OR A MOUSE!?
[07:53:08] <johnkpaul> and you can extend it
[07:53:24] <enapupe> HI.. I'm having some issues with the scroll event and scrollTop function on Chrome <> Firefox, I can't find a way to make both work
[07:53:25] <johnkpaul> squeakytoy: when you ask, and you can't find, you should build and contribute
[07:53:30] <ajpiano> squeakytoy: http://benalman.com/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce-plugin/
[07:53:54] <enapupe> $(window).bind("scroll", function(){ << this works on chrome but not on firefox
[07:54:06] <johnkpaul> :) debounce is a great name
[07:54:17] <squeakytoy> debounce plugin seems nifty
[07:54:21] <enapupe> var top = ($("body").scrollTop() + 40); << this works on chrome but not on fifefox
[07:54:34] <squeakytoy> ajpiano: seems cool, thanks
[07:54:37] <Jon47> enapupe i think that the scroll event does not bubble up the DOM
[07:54:46] <Jon47> try binding on the body instead?
[07:55:15] <johnkpaul> enapupe: the body isn't scrolling
[07:55:16] <Jon47> you can def get it to work, i know that much..
[07:55:20] <johnkpaul> usually, the window is
[07:55:38] <enapupe> yeah, body won't work
[07:55:43] <enapupe> on both browsers
[07:56:44] <enapupe> ops,
[07:56:55] <enapupe> document . bind scroll workls on chrome
[07:56:59] <enapupe> not on firefox
[07:57:37] <enapupe> oh, wait
[07:57:46] <enapupe> document.scroll sworks on both
[07:57:57] <Jon47> boya!
[07:58:13] <enapupe> now the other problem:
[07:58:14] <enapupe> var top = ($("html,body").scrollTop() + 40);
[07:58:21] <enapupe> this works on firefox, not on chrome
[07:58:43] <enapupe> chrome only works with $("body")
[07:58:43] <enapupe> not the two elements
[07:59:16] <squeakytoy> ajpiano: the debouncer is frikken cool, thanks
[07:59:30] <enapupe> $("html").scrollTop on chrome is always zero
[07:59:32] <ajpiano> it's ice cold
[07:59:33] <johnkpaul> enapupe: $(window).scrollTop() should work fine in both unless you have some wierd css
[07:59:39] <squeakytoy> ice ice baby
[07:59:49] <enapupe> letme see
[08:00:20] <johnkpaul> is debounce a commonly understood word?
[08:01:01] <Xotix> Is it possible to get everything a user types into a textarea, modify it somehow, and return it so my modified stuff gets added to the textbox?
[08:01:20] <Xotix> something like, on input() event
[08:01:41] <enapupe> johnkpaul: bingo :D
[08:04:28] <johnkpaul> enapupe: great
[08:07:02] <Gozzy> timmywil i just read your slide on weird operators, good stuff thx!
[08:07:22] <timmywil> thanks Gozzy :)
[08:07:47] <Defusal> hi everyone
[08:08:03] <Defusal> the $(window).load event handler never fires
[08:08:13] <Defusal> does anyone have any idea why that would happen?
[08:10:50] <Gozzy> Defusal are you sure the page is completly loaded maybe something is stalling
[08:11:12] <Defusal> Gozzy, im pretty damn sure it's loaded
[08:11:33] <Defusal> theres not really anything on the page yet...
[08:12:33] <Defusal> i need to use load to create an iframe for comet streaming, as when using ajax, even with the jQuery streaming library, the data is only returned after the connection closes
[08:13:03] <Defusal> apparently creating an iframe a short period after the window load event stops the browser from appearing to load forever
[08:13:16] <Gozzy> weird so if you add window.onload it does work? (window.onload = function(){ alert("this does alert"); })
[08:13:16] <Defusal> but i can't do anything if the load event never fires :(
[08:14:53] <Defusal> Gozzy, it does
[08:15:17] <Gozzy> can you upload the page somewhere?
[08:15:33] <Defusal> Gozzy, the $(window).load event handler doesn't need to be bound from inside $(document).ready right?
[08:16:38] <claudio> Defusal, right.
[08:17:01] <Defusal> Gozzy, not very easily :/
[08:20:22] <Gozzy> Defusal are you using other libraries (maybe you need jQuery.noConflict(); im guessing here)
[08:20:36] <Gozzy> http://www.webdevout.net/test?02 ofcourse it works in a testcase..
[08:20:37] <Defusal> Gozzy, nah, coffeescript
[08:21:03] <Defusal> i just added the ready and load events to a empty script on the login page of this app
[08:21:11] <Defusal> and load doesnt fire there either
[08:21:22] <Defusal> maybe this version of jQuery is bugged or something
[08:21:36] <Gozzy> the script is added to the page? :/
[08:21:37] <Defusal> jquery-1.7.1
[08:22:08] <Defusal> the coffeescript is not precompiled for now, as it makes prototyping a little quicker
[08:22:23] <Defusal> but that wouldnt less with js events
[08:22:44] <Defusal> Gozzy, i can pm you a link to the login page with the issue
[08:22:52] <Defusal> but i doubt theres anything you can do anywa
[08:22:53] <Gozzy> sure
[08:22:55] <Defusal> *anyway
[08:23:00] <Gozzy> ill take a look
[08:23:17] <Defusal> thanks
[08:23:25] <Gozzy> im getting the ready event
[08:23:34] <Gozzy> > ready alert
[08:23:55] <Defusal> yeah
[08:24:02] <Defusal> look at shared.coffee
[08:24:10] <Defusal> its just those two events
[08:24:15] <Defusal> but only ready ever fires
[08:25:17] <LukeNukem> how can i modify entire content of a element?
[08:25:19] <Gozzy> i dont really know coffeescript, dont you need semicolons there?
[08:25:27] <LukeNukem> using .html just adds more content to it, i want to remove old content
[08:25:29] <LukeNukem> and add new content
[08:26:04] <Gozzy> $(window).load -> alert "loaded!" >>> $(window).load -> alert "loaded!"; again im guessing :)
[08:26:21] <NodeX> $(element).html(html); // changes the HTML not appends it Luke
[08:26:37] <Defusal> Gozzy, no ; needed
[08:26:59] <Defusal> coffeescript removes all the verbose ugly, unnecessary syntax from js
[08:27:41] <Defusal> "CoffeeScript is well done and more convenient to use than JS" - Brendan Eich, creator of JavaScript
[08:27:53] <Defusal> :P
[08:28:01] <imsky> wat
[08:28:28] <Defusal> i gotta run, if you think of anything please let me know Gozzy, i will have to continue trying to figure out the cause of this odd behaviour in about 30 mins
[08:28:30] <Gozzy> i dont know, i could use that ugly unnecessary syntax =p
[08:29:34] <jrockjiggz> LukeNukem: html() will replace content
[08:32:59] <empireoflight> Hey can someone tell me why my title isn't appearing in the #linktitle div
[08:33:01] <empireoflight> http://jsfiddle.net/dPHvD/
[08:33:48] <LukeNukem> looking empireoflight
[08:33:51] <warrenparsons> empireoflight: Because there's no #linktitle div?
[08:33:57] <empireoflight> just saw that
[08:34:05] <warrenparsons> :P
[08:34:24] <empireoflight> http://jsfiddle.net/dPHvD/1/ still doesn't work
[08:34:32] <LukeNukem> yes
[08:34:34] <LukeNukem> thats why
[08:34:49] <warrenparsons> empireoflight: Your syntax for .text() is incorrect.
[08:35:00] <fof> http://jsfiddle.net/dPHvD/2/
[08:35:07] <warrenparsons> empireoflight: Should be .text($(this).attr('title'));
[08:35:13] <empireoflight> aha
[08:35:36] <fof> have a look at that, how come you were returning false though?
[08:35:50] <jita> should i place my scripts in body or head? Which is optimal place ?
[08:36:19] <warrenparsons> empireoflight: There are a lot of syntax issues here, actually. One sec.
[08:36:27] <jrockjiggz> empireoflight: http://jsfiddle.net/dPHvD/3/
[08:36:28] <empireoflight> thank you
[08:36:33] <fof> yes i went through them
[08:37:00] <warrenparsons> empireoflight: Try this http://jsfiddle.net/dPHvD/4/
[08:37:17] <warrenparsons> empireoflight: Not critical, but I replaced your return false with e.preventDefault() as well
[08:37:33] <baubbelayponge> jita, at the bottom
[08:37:33] <empireoflight> thanks i'll learn what that does
[08:37:44] <jita> baubbelayponge, in the body ?
[08:37:44] <fof> http://fuelyourcoding.com/jquery-events-stop-misusing-return-false/
[08:37:52] <warrenparsons> ?preventdefault
[08:37:53] <bot-t> event.preventDefault(): If this method is called, the default action of the event will not be triggered. http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/
[08:38:15] <warrenparsons> empireoflight: The "e" in function(e){ … } is just shorthand for "event"
[08:38:43] <empireoflight> great thanks so much
[08:38:54] <jrockjiggz> i suggest reading a tutorial on event bubbling: http://www.permadi.com/tutorial/jsEventBubbling/index.html
[08:40:31] <andrewhl> if I have a page with several links with the class .link, and I just want to catch an on click on ANY of them, would $('.link').click() work?
[08:40:48] <johnkpaul> andrewhl: yes
[08:41:10] <johnkpaul> that event will fire when any element with the class "link" is clicked on
[08:41:15] <johnkpaul> even if it's not a link
[08:41:31] <baubbelayponge> jita, http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html#js_bottom
[08:41:37] <johnkpaul> $("a.link").click() would be only links with the class link, but that's damn confusing
[08:41:42] <johnkpaul> so don't have a class link on a link
[08:41:50] <johnkpaul> it's like <div class="div"></div>
[08:42:34] <aqeel> hi

[08:43:49] <xwurf> hi, how is the jquery code for evaluating if the current focused DOM-Element is an input field?
[08:43:55] <djsounds02> http://burnspet.co.uk/products.html  There is a see all link and a close link
[08:43:56] <LukeNukem> Um, sometime before somebody showed me how facebook added comments instantly
[08:44:02] <LukeNukem> its actually cheating the user into thinking its realtime
[08:44:27] <aqeel> lukenukem
[08:44:32] <LukeNukem> aqeel,

[08:46:02] <xwurf> @jitta: documentready
[08:46:16] <xwurf> ah, sorry: i meant document.keypress
[08:46:19] <aqeel> u remember telling me the if(){} clause
[08:46:41] <aqeel> fof explain?
[08:47:23] <Nuno147> I have a design question. please look at my code here : http://jsfiddle.net/WfT3a/16/
[08:47:29] <aqeel> well guys/gals those with big monitors can tell me the advance page loads the screen without breaking any position?
[08:47:36] <LukeNukem> aqeel, oh..your project is based a lot on that?
[08:47:50] <aqeel> somewhat yes
[08:48:04] <aqeel> u see the color control...
[08:48:28] <aqeel> u can see my code has changed alot
[08:48:29] <LukeNukem> if color == 'blabla' and so on
[08:48:30] <LukeNukem> i guess
[08:48:50] <Nuno147> my question regards this code is about the saved_this variable. is there any other way to achieve the same result without counting on save the this in the upper function ?
[08:48:57] <aqeel> well not exactly....first i want to see it works then i will shift this into css
[08:48:58] <Nuno147> seems kinda ugly to me.
[08:49:11] <LukeNukem> nice

[08:50:31] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[08:50:45] <djsounds02> somebody help me please
[08:50:58] <DerekPioneer> i have some hover elements that i don't want to work when the user clicks on something and un-hides a div. http://bit.ly/xkKIun
[08:51:01] <djsounds02> i would like to recreate something
[08:51:09] <DerekPioneer> when this div is visible, how do i stop any events outside of that div from working?
[08:51:38] <DerekPioneer> in the example i linked to you can click on any of the text boxes and it will pop open a text edit box, i don't want anything else int he page to work when that text box is open
[08:51:38] <DerekPioneer> f
[08:51:40] <jita> whats the difference between $(function(){} and $(document).ready(function () {} ?
[08:51:47] <aqeel> well this is true too i cannot make everyone in this world happy at same time.....i am also going to introduce themeing...so can choose which color one likes...
[08:51:50] <DerekPioneer> for example, while that text box is open you can still drag text boxes around, i want that to stop
[08:51:59] <DerekPioneer> how do i stop events outside of a div?
[08:52:18] <LukeNukem> djsounds02, vague
[08:52:35] <aqeel> mouseout remove your mouseenter code
[08:52:36] <djsounds02> LukeNukem: http://burnspet.co.uk/products.html There is a drop down list on here I would like to recreate it
[08:52:39] <LukeNukem> aqeel, could be better
[08:53:21] <DerekPioneer> djsounds02: slidein and slideout() i believe
[08:53:24] <DerekPioneer> fadein fadeout
[08:53:34] <DerekPioneer> simply a matter of having a div with those extra options with display:none
[08:53:37] <aqeel> thanks but i really will be needing gfreat help from great minds
[08:53:52] <LukeNukem> djsounds02, i dont see one
[08:53:59] <djsounds02> Luke it says see all
[08:54:07] <xckpd7> would anyone mind taking a look at my jQuery app and telling me how to correctly remove individual items? http://jsfiddle.net/QCjj4/45/
[08:54:17] <xckpd7> *backbone app, whoops
[08:54:27] <aqeel> well yeah that is what i will have to tackle ....
[08:54:56] <LukeNukem> djsounds02, simple, see .hide and .show
[08:55:02] <LukeNukem> also .animate
[08:55:03] <aqeel> and this is half now from where i started...
[08:55:25] <LukeNukem> aqeel, do you listen to songs while coding? it helps :D
[08:55:25] <djsounds02> LukeNukem, I'm not very good with jquery tbh
[08:55:27] <iateadonut> what's the equivalent of '#ach_type:checked' for a <select><option> dropdown?
[08:55:43] <aqeel> got jquery rusted....now as i am experiencing.....geeting those things back
[08:55:49] <LukeNukem> djsounds02, its pretty easy..Take a look at .hide and .show functions first. And then come back when you are stuck
[08:56:11] <aqeel> yup sure it does
[08:58:26] <aqeel> well does jquery handle 3d stuff?
[08:58:51] <jedimind> modern warfare 3 was written in jquery
[08:58:59] <fof> Nuno147: like this? http://jsfiddle.net/WfT3a/17/
[08:59:01] <iateadonut> xckpd7, that's kind of a cool app.
[08:59:32] <aqeel> i was kinda stuck should use jquery or go for flash?
[08:59:43] <jedimind> aqeel, what are you looking to accomplish ?
[08:59:45] <jedimind> i was kidding about MW3
[08:59:51] <LukeNukem> jedimind, you dont say?
[09:00:08] <jedimind> i thought i'd clear that up before anyone got misinformed
[09:00:48] <aqeel> well a 3d model of iphone from inside out and can rotate to see it components and where clicking the componenet will give options for which app is there for that chosen part
[09:00:56] <LukeNukem> Thanks captain obvious is what i was really supposed to say *facepalm*
[09:01:02] <xckpd7> iateadonut: thanks... working on it
[09:01:06] <aqeel> in cydia app store
[09:01:07] <LukeNukem> aqeel, flash?
[09:01:36] <aqeel> wel i know flash though....but want to be sure which is feasible
[09:01:47] <LukeNukem> jquery
[09:01:56] <LukeNukem> anything is safer than flash
[09:03:00] <lekefly_> $(".next").click(function() { sliderInstance.sliderWidth(); }); any guesses how i should spesify width here? :p
[09:03:52] <iateadonut> usually, in javascript, you do something like this:   onclick = 'function1(this)';  and then to create the function:  function function1(node) {  $(node).parent.destroy();  }
[09:03:58] <LukeNukem> lekefly_, what are you doing
[09:04:03] <iateadonut> xckpd7, something like that.
[09:04:41] <lekefly_> LukeNukem: its for a slider and its properties.. but it doesnt say how to spesify
[09:04:57] <LukeNukem> try stackoverflow
[09:05:05] <claudio> iateadonut, usually, we do not use "onclick" attributes (anymore)
[09:05:53] <lekefly_> LukeNukem: Any guess tho?
[09:06:22] <LukeNukem> i did not really understand what your question is exactly
[09:06:29] <LukeNukem> also a live page?
[09:07:15] <lekefly_> LukeNukem: im guessing i need to spesify what the sliderInstance.sliderWidth should be.. but i dont know where :p
[09:07:27] <aqeel> code?
[09:07:34] <aqeel> jsfiddle?
[09:08:15] <lekefly_> updateSliderSize(500px) like this maybe..
[09:08:20] <iateadonut> claudio, you mean bind an event instead or you mean a different method than 'onclick'?
[09:10:01] <claudio> iateadonut, "bind an event"
[09:10:32] <aqeel> ok guys back to my controls....which jquery media control is better to use....pause/resume,toggle,delay,pause on hover....these are tasks need to be performed
[09:10:56] <aqeel> what i have is making use of aautoscroll
[09:11:10] <aqeel> ever heard of it?
[09:11:45] <iateadonut> claudio, got it.  xckpd7, the point was how to use 'this'; ignore onclick.
[09:14:29] <xwurf> hi, i have problem:: whenever someenter enters the "enter"-key (e.keycode == 13), i "return false;" so that forms in the webpage are not executed. Now there is one special-case-form in the webpage, an exception from the rule, for which the "enter" key should work. Has anyone an idea how to realize this?
[09:14:32] <xwurf> (with jquery)
[09:15:53] <johnkpaul> xwurf: don't return false?
[09:16:01] <nFFF> (e.keycode == 13) $('#specialform').submit(); return false;
[09:16:24] <xwurf> yeah, but what then so that the other forms are NOT executed?
[09:16:48] <xwurf> this is my function looks like: http://paste.pocoo.org/show/557640/
[09:16:59] <xwurf> so NO form executes itself on pressing enter
[09:17:12] <nFFF> Whats wrong with my solution ? :<
[09:17:28] <xwurf> ahhh, did not read your post nFFF, i will try it :)
[09:18:54] <iateadonut> xckpd7, are you going to make a website with that or something?
[09:19:51] <lowerkey> Hi all, I was wondering how I have to write the autocomplete's search function to supply an extra parameter in the search url
[09:20:29] <xwurf> @nFFF: it works ty
[09:20:36] <Roots47> Hey, how can I implement a delay for hide() onmouseout?
[09:20:59] <Roots47> tried $('.plan_item_45_projects').delay(1000).hide();   , realized in the docs it says it won't work with hide or show
[09:21:54] <xwurf> @nFFF: problem: what is if i have an ajaxsubmitbutton?
[09:22:03] <xwurf> with some "complete"-js-function
[09:22:07] <nFFFF> ?
[09:22:17] <nFFFF> ajaxsubmitbutton?
[09:22:21] <nFFFF> What is this?
[09:22:23] <nFFFF> ?jsfiddle
[09:22:24] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[09:22:38] <xwurf> i use yii-framework
[09:22:52] <fof> Roots47: http://forum.jquery.com/topic/using-delay-with-hide-at-onmouseout-call
[09:23:06] <nFFFF> Ok...
[09:24:11] <arnpro> hey guys, is it possible to take a snapshot of the user's browser, make it a picture, upload it, and retrieve link of it???
[09:24:40] <fof> i hope note
[09:25:00] <nickelnick> arnpro no way
[09:25:29] <nickelnick> unless you have a way to ssh in and then run a shortcut command for ctrl print screen
[09:25:32] <xwurf> is there some way to check if a special form has the focus?
[09:25:38] <arnpro> nickelnick: didn't actually mean the whole browser, but the page where the javascript will be embedded
[09:25:40] <xwurf> i mean if form with id "myspecialform" has focus?
[09:25:55] <nickelnick> yea well, wouldn't "this" be the focus?
[09:26:22] <K3|Chris> http://api.jquery.com/?s=focus xwurf
[09:26:29] <K3|Chris> lrn2search api
[09:27:07] <xwurf> ty
[09:27:22] <nickelnick> maybe try something like console.info(this); and see what you get
[09:27:27] <fof> arnpro: maybe look at http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/ ?
[09:28:02] <jita> How can i reset the form without submitting it? I have a reset button and i want to submit the resetted form using ajax
[09:28:02] <jita> ?
[09:28:26] <nickelnick> huh? reset the form without submitting?
[09:28:32] <aqeel> on key press give ascii for ctrl+prnt screen, say on submission might work?
[09:28:44] <arnpro> fof: you rock.
[09:29:17] <Roots47> fof: thanks bro, works like a charm
[09:30:03] <nickelnick> oh im dumb
[09:30:32] <tocka> Hey guys, I have 10 divs, I want to get 2 of them randomly and display them
[09:30:37] <tocka> other 8 would be hidden
[09:30:38] <tocka> :/
[09:30:49] <nickelnick> xwurf: $('#myspecialform:focus')
[09:31:00] <xwurf> got now what i wanted: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1562056/newbie-help-with-jquery-checking-for-focus
[09:31:09] <nickelnick> my bad
[09:31:33] <xwurf> web-programming is sooooo. ARGH ^^
[09:31:40] <nickelnick> FUN!
[09:31:41] <nickelnick> :)
[09:31:44] <aqeel> initially hide all,rand() any 2....
[09:32:16] <tocka> ok, lets try:)
[09:32:41] <nickelnick> aqeel: perhaps you need to generate a random number that is within the index of those
[09:32:53] <nickelnick> assign it to the eleements with those ids
[09:32:54] <aqeel> sure that must be specified
[09:33:00] <nickelnick> and then remove those id's
[09:33:29] <nickelnick> so div id=1-8 or whatever
[09:34:19] <nickelnick> var randomnumber = Math.floor(Math.random()* 8)
[09:35:09] <nickelnick> then just use that random number as a var when your selecting the id...
[09:35:17] <nickelnick> that's what I would probably do
[09:35:38] <aqeel> tocka u listening...for u....
[09:36:16] <aqeel> thanks nickelnick
[09:36:36] <nickelnick> sure,also check out http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1527803/generating-random-numbers-in-javascript
[09:37:06] <nickelnick> and then removing the 2 necessary is a pretty simple selection with jquery.
[09:39:08] <sx2020> any one have an idea why I am unable to click on checkboxes or an input file button?
[09:41:02] <nickelnick> in all browser?
[09:41:15] <nickelnick> check closing tags
[09:41:25] <nickelnick> also to make sure the field is not disabled
[09:49:45] <jita> anyone can have a look http://dpaste.org/6d88P/ ?
[09:49:58] <jita> it works but then if the event triggers afterwards
[09:50:01] <jita> it wont do anything
[09:54:21] <LukeNukem> hello, how can i select a element with a few words not exact
[09:54:46] <LukeNukem> like the element id can be myelement, but i wanna be able to select it with myelem
[09:55:23] <Eviltwin> Why?
[09:55:26] <Eviltwin> Why would you want to do that?
[09:55:30] <amezghal> LukeNukem: id == identifier
[09:56:49] <gnarf> LukeNukem: use a class instead if you want to group some elements by a "prefix" of their id...
[09:56:52] <LukeNukem> Eviltwin, trying to manipulate realtimeness
[09:56:53] <Roots47> LukeNukem:  Get I would do it like so ... var id_variable = $('#id_ofelement_with_id').attr('id')  ... then do a substr function on it to get the first so many letters like id_variable = id_variable.substr(5)
[09:57:24] <gnarf> "realtimeness" ?
[09:57:52] <Roots47> wait, you want to select it with myelem? or just get the first so many characters of the id attribute?
[09:58:06] <Eviltwin> LukeNukem: I still don't understand what you're trying to do but it sounds like a bad idea that defeats the purpose of IDs
[09:58:07] <LukeNukem> nvm
[09:58:15] <gnarf> LukeNukem: its a HORRIBLY slow selector compared to a class... but you can always $("[id^='myelem']")
[09:58:16] <LukeNukem> using class
[09:58:19] <gnarf> Eviltwin: agreed
[10:00:24] <Roots47> I could understand wanting to get the substr of an id, like maybe to obtain a unique id integer from the end
[10:02:44] <BoxTest> Hey guys I was just wondering if there was a method of determining  which image was clicked?  I'm using an ajax call to return data. The data being returned is <img src="imgs/thumbs/01.jpg" alt="001" title="001" id="imgclick" /><img src="imgs/thumbs/02.jpg" alt="002" title="002" id="imgclick" /><img src="imgs/thumbs/03.jpg" alt="003" title="003" id="imgclick" /> (and so on) is there a way of creating a function  to determine which one
[10:02:44] <BoxTest> is clicked? via like ID or something?
[10:03:22] <Eviltwin> BoxTest: You'll want to attach an event listener
[10:03:46] <BoxTest> Eviltwin,  I figured as much I've done that but how do I determine which one?
[10:04:12] <amezghal> $(event.target).attr('id')
[10:04:15] <BoxTest> $("#ImgClick").click(function(){showRegSize();}); is what I have how do I pass WHICH one..
[10:04:50] <rasmusth> does anybody know if I can modify DOMNodeRemoved to not fire off tons of events when removing a node with children?
[10:05:02] <blankstare> hey guys.  sort of green to things - how can i slide two elements simultaneously (e.g - $('#id1, #id2).slideDown('slow'))?
[10:05:28] <aqeel> u mentione dit
[10:05:34] <Eviltwin> BoxTest: Once you get the quotes right, that should work fine
[10:06:08] <BoxTest> what do you mean the quotes?
[10:06:19] <Eviltwin> Sorry, that was for blankstare
[10:06:28] <nickelnick> haha, yea iw as gonna say
[10:06:37] <nickelnick> $('#id1, #id2).slideDown('slow'))
[10:06:42] <nickelnick> oops stupid paste
[10:06:43] <aqeel> $('#id1, #id2').slideDown('slow');
[10:06:47] <nickelnick> there u go
[10:07:21] <blankstare> aqeel: yeah, that's not currently working
[10:07:41] <aqeel> see you code.....mising ' and extra )
[10:07:43] <gnarf> BoxTest:  - check event.target
[10:08:05] <aqeel> jsfiddle?
[10:08:36] <rasmusth> ?livequery
[10:08:36] <bot-t> livequery is the devil. stay away from its evil temptation
[10:08:39] <rasmusth> :D
[10:09:04] <gnarf> hey - my livequery factoid is still around
[10:09:06] <aqeel> bot-t???
[10:09:09] <blankstare> I'll put it in jsfiddle in a sec
[10:10:05] <BoxTest> yeah I get "event" not defined
[10:10:22] <gnarf> BoxTest: function( event ) { console.log( event.target ); }
[10:10:33] <gnarf> BoxTest: event is the first arg to a event handler
[10:11:24] <gnarf> BoxTest: or you could use a delegated event too - make it a little easier
[10:11:42] <BoxTest> perhaps you guys don't get what I'm saying there's multiple ImgClicks all with the same name....
[10:11:55] <nickelnick> and so?
[10:12:11] <gnarf> $( "#container" ).on( "click", "img", function( event ) { console.log( this.title ); });
[10:12:21] <gnarf> BoxTest: a) ID is unique
[10:12:30] <BoxTest> title works
[10:12:31] <gnarf> if you have more than one element with the same ID - its not vali
[10:13:00] <gnarf> i assume all these "imgclick"s are in the same containing element?
[10:13:14] <BoxTest> yes
[10:13:25] <gnarf> you can just attach a "delegated" click handler on the parent node that will respond to clicks on any "img" tag ^^^
[10:13:32] <aqeel> boxtest use class instead..of id.....always use ONE id for ONLY AND ONLY ONE item
[10:14:37] <aqeel> u can use each on the containing elelemt
[10:14:44] <aqeel> element*
[10:14:44] <BoxTest> Thank you I used a class and that worked
[10:15:26] <m0b> quit
[10:16:32] <danzik171> gnarf: quick question if you have a sec - are all of the animations in jquery.color.js included in jqueryui.core?  it *looks* like they are, but you'd know for sure
[10:16:48] <mathi> hi
[10:16:58] <gnarf> danzik171: yes - but the ui.core is still the old version of color
[10:17:05] <sphinxxx> anyone familiar with table sorter plugin?
[10:17:07] <mathi> how do I encode an object in json?
[10:17:10] <gnarf> its actually "effects core"
[10:17:13] <gnarf> not "ui core"
[10:17:52] <aqeel> there is specific color plugin for jquery where in each browser looks same....
[10:18:03] <Eviltwin> ?
[10:18:06] <aqeel> i can't rememeber the link
[10:18:08] <danzik171> gnarf: thanks - essentially we're including both an old version of color.js, and UI stuff - looked suspiciously like redundant code to me
[10:24:37] <sphinxxx> I'm using table sorter plugin, and having a weird issue where it only sorts descending
[10:24:53] <sphinxxx> it will only sort ascending if i hold shift while clicking the column header
[10:27:25] <itsgreen> Working on a dropdown menu, LI's and UL's, I want want to add a class to the top level item when I click an item 'below' it, but that sub item could be 3 levels deep
[10:27:31] <itsgreen> how should I do that?
[10:29:29] <jrockjiggz> itsgreen: theres many solutions available if you check google, whether CSS or javascript/jquery solutions
[10:30:34] <lowerkey> Hi all, could someone help me with this question: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9470227/how-to-customize-the-autocomplete-search-event ?
[10:30:52] <DerekPioneer> how do i stop hovers from working in the whole document when a div is toggled
[10:31:04] <Eviltwin> lowerkey: Not terribly specific
[10:31:09] <johnkpaul> "div is toggled"? DerekPioneer
[10:31:10] <Eviltwin> What "additional parameter" is this?
[10:31:26] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: when a user clicks on a textbox, a div popup appears
[10:31:36] <DerekPioneer> i want all other events outside of that div popup to be disabled
[10:31:37] <lowerkey> @Eviltwin: I want to modify the search parameter that gets sent to the server on a remote autocomplete
[10:31:45] <lowerkey> Eviltwin: I want to modify the search parameter that gets sent to the server on a remote autocomplete
[10:31:47] <DerekPioneer> while that div popup is open
[10:31:55] <itsgreen> damn I a bloody idiot, could have used $(this).parents('#id > #li').dowhatiwant
[10:32:28] <Eviltwin> lowerkey: That still doesn't explain HOW you want to modify it
[10:32:54] <lowerkey> Eviltwin: That's what I'm asking, how do I add an extra parameter into the search
[10:33:03] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: and all of those events are added using jQuery?
[10:33:09] <DerekPioneer> yes
[10:33:17] <DerekPioneer> they're all jquery ui draggable events
[10:33:20] <murosai_> im trying to use this jquery addon http://trentrichardson.com/examples/timepicker/ but im not sure what else i need to do than include the javascrip file?
[10:33:24] <itsgreen> lowerkey, you should add a code snippet
[10:33:34] <Eviltwin> lowerkey: I'd like you to show me what it does currently and what you would like it to do
[10:33:36] <DerekPioneer> so basically when the popup is opened i want to stop the user from being able to drag boxes
[10:33:40] <Eviltwin> Explainign specifics
[10:33:43] <Eviltwin> Use examples
[10:34:05] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: I don't know if this is the best, but you could override $.fn.on
[10:34:20] <Eviltwin> Woah
[10:34:28] <Eviltwin> johnkpaul: Yeah, that's generally not a good place to start
[10:34:40] <johnkpaul> yeah, I know, I agree
[10:34:42] <itsgreen> lowerkey, have you check the example in: http://jqueryui.com/demos/autocomplete/#remote-jsonp
[10:34:49] <johnkpaul> I don't know of any other way to intercept _all_ events
[10:34:58] <johnkpaul> theres no beforeevent hook
[10:35:00] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: i saw somewhere where someone had a transparent invisible div that covered the whole page
[10:35:12] <DerekPioneer> with a z-index just behind the popup
[10:35:33] <johnkpaul> oh, of course, you an do that
[10:35:41] <johnkpaul> that doesn't really stop the events in the first place
[10:36:15] <lowerkey> Eviltwin: I updated the question with some code
[10:36:22] <johnkpaul> but then you'd have to do some complicated stuff to get your div _above_ that transparent invisible div
[10:36:29] <sam113101> what's the difference between function this() {} and var that = function() {} in javascript?
[10:36:44] <DerekPioneer> hmm
[10:36:49] <sphinxxx> so none knows tablesorter here?
[10:37:48] <johnkpaul> sam113101: the difference is that one is a function expresson and one is a function declration
[10:37:59] <johnkpaul> sphinxxx: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1013385/what-is-the-difference-between-a-function-expression-vs-declaration-in-javascrip
[10:38:08] <johnkpaul> oops, I mean sam113101 not sphinxxx
[10:38:31] <Eviltwin> lowerkey: Use a callback function and make the AJAX calls directly
[10:39:07] <lowerkey> Eviltwin: like Andrew Whitaker describes on SO?
[10:40:29] <Eviltwin> Sure why not
[10:40:59] <sphinxxx> .html doesn't have a callback?
[10:41:08] <johnkpaul> .html is syncrohnous
[10:41:11] <johnkpaul> it doesn't need a callback
[10:41:27] <sphinxxx> oh ok
[10:43:10] <DerekPioneer> how do i find inner values of <span>sdfsdfsaf</span>
[10:43:20] <DerekPioneer> like $('span [innervalue=sdfsdfsdf]')
[10:43:28] <Zzaichik> .text()
[10:43:35] <DerekPioneer> that's a selector too?
[10:43:41] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: you mean search by innerHTML? I don't believe that you can
[10:43:45] <johnkpaul> you coud easily write a filter though
[10:44:05] <johnkpaul> $("span").filter(function(el){return el.text() == "whateveryouwanthere"})
[10:50:52] <cook1es> hi there, im running a userscript which implements jquery on a website which already has jquery and it seems to break something on the main site, specifically a jquery plugin called superfish. basically i get "jQuery(e).superfish(); is not a function" and it works fine without my userscript.. any ideas?
[10:51:18] <johnkpaul> what does your userscript do?
[10:51:24] <johnkpaul> ?jsfiddle
[10:51:25] <bot-t> jsFiddle (http://jsfiddle.net) is an online IDE for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is the best way to provide test cases of your jQuery bugs (for support and the bug tracker). Make sure to include the jQuery library (on the left side) and any relevant markup or CSS. You can include external dependencies via the Add Resources tab. You can also mock AJAX requests.
[10:56:33] <cook1es> johnkpaul: it does alot, 1500 lines. do you mean I should add superfish and my userscript to a jsfiddle and see what breaks? i just dont see how my userscript can break a site script as they are in completely(?) different scopes
[10:56:56] <johnkpaul> they _aren't_ though
[10:57:01] <johnkpaul> a user script runs in the context of the page IIRC
[10:57:08] <johnkpaul> I mean you should share your userscript with us so we can see
[10:57:10] <DerekPioneer>  $('#fontDropdown dd a span[font=MyriadPro-Regular]')     works fine, but       $('#fontDropdown dd a span[font=Voluta Script Pro]')   returns an error: "Syntax error, unrecognized expression: [font=Voluta Script Pro]"
[10:57:19] <DerekPioneer> can I not have spaces in an attribute selector?
[10:57:46] <cook1es> DerekPioneer: Just add quotes
[10:58:21] <DerekPioneer> cook1es: ty
[10:59:43] <cook1es> johnkpaul: What do you mean in the context? After all, I can't use jquery functions from the site in my script without implementing jquery in it. I can't share the script, its private :-(
[11:00:15] <litwol> o/ Peeter /wc
[11:00:17] <litwol> oops
[11:00:21] <Peeter> :D
[11:00:23] <litwol> wrong chan
[11:00:37] <litwol> and just my luck there's an acual peeter here
[11:00:38] <litwol> lol
[11:00:44] <johnkpaul> cook1es: that's not true, you _can_ use jQuery functions in our script, you just need it to load after the page is loaded
[11:00:44] <litwol> Peeter: well hello non the less stranger
[11:01:22] <johnkpaul> cook1es: http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/content_scripts.html
[11:01:28] <johnkpaul> search for document_idle
[11:04:06] <DerekPioneer> johnkpaul: going back to my question earlier about stopping events when a div is visible, i'm still a little unsure of where to start
[11:04:11] <DerekPioneer> this is the page i'm talking about: http://bit.ly/yHG6jX
[11:04:23] <DerekPioneer> if you click on a textbox it will popup a div
[11:04:36] <DerekPioneer> but if you move your mouse around the picture of the black couple
[11:04:42] <DerekPioneer> you'll see the hovers and ui-draggable stuff still reacting
[11:04:51] <johnkpaul> ooh
[11:04:51] <mathi> How do I get the DOM object of the the html string that I inserted with .prepend() ?
[11:04:55] <johnkpaul> that's differnt than I thought DerekPioneer
[11:05:57] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: pointer-events:none
[11:06:03] <johnkpaul> on s7Wrapper
[11:06:33] <johnkpaul> while the text box is open, and then change it back when it's done
[11:06:38] <jrockjiggz> mathi: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1443233/easier-way-to-get-a-jquery-object-from-appended-element
[11:07:15] <mathi> jrockjiggz, thanks!
[11:07:19] <cook1es> johnkpaul: When I create a new userscript with just the content @include jquery.com $('body').hide(); it doesn't work actually hide the body, wasn't that what you meant?
[11:07:36] <cook1es> where-as if I implement jquery inside the userscript, it works
[11:08:01] <EdwardIII> hey guys
[11:08:07] <cook1es> Do I need to address jQuery in another way?
[11:08:26] <johnkpaul> cook1es: you want this to only run on jquery.com?
[11:08:30] <DerekPioneer> ahh johnkpaul you are a hero
[11:08:39] <DerekPioneer> ty
[11:08:49] <johnkpaul> :) no problem
[11:08:55] <johnkpaul> goes to show how much actual live demos can help
[11:09:13] <johnkpaul> cook1es: you might want to try jQuery instead of $
[11:09:15] <cook1es> johnkpaul: no, I am just using it to test what you said
[11:09:49] <cook1es> Ok. Tested it, didn't work
[11:10:00] <johnkpaul> oh, can you try setTimeout(function(){jQuery("body").hide()},1000)
[11:10:14] <johnkpaul> it should be after domready, but just in case
[11:11:58] <cook1es> doesn't work either
[11:12:26] <cook1es> http://localhostr.com/files/dyrGPYm/TEST.user.js here is the script, I will try it in chrome aswell
[11:13:27] <sam113101> is it "good" to have function declarations inside other function declations?
[11:14:08] <cook1es> johnkpaul: Same no-go with Chrome for me
[11:14:21] <jesly> if u want to restrict the usage to particular functions itself
[11:14:43] <cook1es> johnkpaul: Firebug reports no error in Firefox, but Chrome <3 does report "Uncaught ReferenceError: jQuery is not defined" for the userscript
[11:15:37] <jesly> cookles: jquery isnt loaded??
[11:17:23] <johnkpaul> cook1es: I see the same problem, but tbh, I'm very confused as to why
[11:17:29] <johnkpaul> userscripts are suposed to run after domready
[11:18:18] <johnkpaul> cook1es: In most cases, listening for the onload event is unnecessary for content scripts running at "document_idle" because they are guaranteed to run after the DOM is complete.
[11:19:39] <johnkpaul> that's from the documentation I snet you for chrome
[11:19:45] <mathi> is it better to use parent() or closest()?
[11:20:42] <johnkpaul> closest includes itself
[11:20:45] <johnkpaul> in your search
[11:20:51] <johnkpaul> what are you trying to accomplish?
[11:20:54] <CharlieSu> Hi.  I've got a HTML table w/ a variable number of rows.  All rows have the exact same columns.  I'm using AJAX/JQuery to append data to this table.  Is there a way to use jquery to summarize the data in this table and send it to the server using JQuery?
[11:21:13] <johnkpaul> oh, parent, singular, parent is definitely better
[11:21:57] <mathi> johnkpaul, looks like closest give better performances: http://jsperf.com/jquery-parents-vs-closest/8
[11:22:19] <johnkpaul> that's parent_S_
[11:22:25] <johnkpaul> you asked about parent() or closest()
[11:22:43] <mathi> right:-)
[11:23:17] <jesly> CharlieSu: am not sure, this method m8 be stupid,  u m8 need to have the contents of each cell in some text box
[11:23:55] <CharlieSu> jesly: humm..  ok..  not sure what you mean but ok..
[11:24:03] <jesly> else content = $(elem).innerhtml is a good idea
[11:24:18] <jesly> CharlieSu: the first said was absolute blunder
[11:24:30] <jesly> never mind the stuff
[11:25:08] <jesly> CharlieSu: i can write a pastie of my idea. johnkpaul can help u a lot better ask him
[11:25:08] <jesly> :)
[11:25:15] <seion> hey if I wanted to call a function delcared in a imported js file how would I call it
[11:25:21] <CharlieSu> jesly: ok thanks
[11:25:52] <seion> ex <script type... src="the imported js file"></script>    onclick run function inside that js script
[11:26:21] <johnkpaul> CharlieSu: if your server can parse html, just use $("table").html()
[11:26:40] <johnkpaul> I guess it depends on what you mean by "summarize"
[11:28:09] <CharlieSu> johnkpaul: yes it can..
[11:28:50] <johnkpaul> then something like .... $.post("your_backend_url.php",{data:$("table").html()})
[11:29:36] <cook1es> johnkpaul: I have been developing this userscript a long time so I have pretty much accepted that's not how it works, disappointing but yeah >_<
[11:31:07] <jesly> CharliwSu: this m8 work, m be a dirty method
[11:31:39] <jesly> CharlieSu: http://pastie.org/3474262
[11:32:03] <johnkpaul> cook1es: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5092726/make-my-userscript-wait-for-other-scripts-to-load
[11:32:17] <johnkpaul> it's _not_ running in the context of the page's window
[11:32:19] <johnkpaul> just the page's dom
[11:32:26] <johnkpaul> I didn't realize that's how userscripts worked
[11:32:47] <johnkpaul> so you need to inject a script tag
[11:32:59] <johnkpaul> in order to run in the context of the iwndow, because you have access to the dom
[11:42:01] <cook1es> johnkpaul: I just had the smartest idea to my original question, include the superfish jquery plugin in my userscript! \o/
[11:44:31] <cook1es> What is the best javascript compressor?
[11:44:50] <dabear> what is the best car?
[11:45:09] <cook1es> Anything red.
[11:45:41] <dabear> http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
[11:45:44] <dabear> closure is good
[11:45:56] <dabear> jquery switched to another one recently I think
[11:46:36] <cook1es> ok
[11:50:22] <xckpd7> question: why does $(element).submit(function(){ return false; }); only work for clicking submit, and not for using the enter key?
[11:50:30] <johnkpaul> cook1es: if this is for production, do some research, if this is for yourself, just use packer
[11:50:40] <xckpd7> sorry in that example, element should be a form
[11:54:49] <johnkpaul> xckpd7: it should still work, I'm surprised
[11:56:51] <litwol> Poetro: or rather here's better. dont want to spam #node.js with stuff that doesn't deal with nodejs
[11:57:00] <Poetro> :P
[11:57:17] <Poetro> litwol: or u can pm if it doesnt even belong here
[11:57:50] <warrenparsons> xckpd7: Does $('#myForm').on('submit', function(){ return false; }); behave any differently?
[11:57:59] <litwol> i was here just yesterday looking to brainsorm on an idea, and i remembered you guys used $LAB (plus your elevated expertise and awesomeness.. which is why i was hoping to find you in one of the js related channels :-D)
[11:58:09] <litwol> Poetro: but after some head banging i found a solution
[11:58:11] <litwol> :-D
[11:58:50] <Poetro> litwol: what was the issue?
[11:59:05] <litwol> on how to make embeddable widget on a site, bootstrap it to bring own $LAB and $jquery unintrusively so it doesn't change existing libraries on the site
[11:59:18] <litwol> but then i figurd it out after some time
[11:59:19] <litwol> :-p
[12:00:27] <Poetro> it is not that difficult... i think both have a noConflict function
[12:00:29] <litwol> snipped goes something like this: $LAB.wait(/* save old jquery version here*/.script(/* bring new libs here*/).wait(/* init own app object by passing in new $LAB and new other libs into it, restore old libs that you just override by importing them dynamicaly*/)
[12:01:00] <litwol> indeed it is not. unless you're not a js guru trying to figure this out for the first time :-D
[12:01:03] <litwol> tehehehhe
[12:02:30] <xp_prg> how do I detect if the browser being used is IE ?
[12:02:44] <litwol> xp_prg: if your stuff breaks, chances are it is ie
[12:02:45] <Poetro> xp_prg: u shouldnt do that
[12:02:49] * litwol troll
[12:03:04] <Poetro> although there used to be the $.browser object
[12:03:25] <xp_prg> I don't have time to go through and figure out IE css3/html5 problems, just going to jquery all ie
[12:03:59] <warrenparsons> xp_prg: For IE9 and below, conditional comments can be useful. IE10 is apparently getting rid of them.
[12:04:22] <Poetro> xp_prg: then use $.browser BUT only if u dont have other solution
[12:04:23] <xp_prg> I know that is why I am going to use jquery to detect the browser
[12:04:30] <polorix> Microsoft's making a new browser? Cool story bro
[12:04:34] <Poetro> xp_prg: but there SHOULD be other solution
[12:04:44] <polorix> :P
[12:04:44] <beasty> hi guys
[12:04:51] <beasty> sean`: alive ?
[12:05:15] * polorix waits to see if sean' is alive
[12:05:30] <beasty> massive highlighting ?
[12:05:30] <beasty> :p
[12:05:40] <polorix> Are we really using IRC to check up on his vitals?
[12:06:00] <polorix> SEAN` BUDDY, I HOPE TO FUCK YOU'RE OK!
[12:06:00] <beasty> yes
[12:06:30] <polorix> welp
[12:06:35] <polorix> As it stands right now, he's flat lining
[12:06:43] <polorix> sorry beasty
[12:06:50] <beasty> i bet he's drunk again :(
[12:07:02] <polorix> 5oclock somewhere =/
[12:07:04] <sean`> what's up
[12:07:08] <polorix> HE LIVES!!!!!
[12:07:10] <sean`> beasty, I'm getting there
[12:07:21] <sean`> I'm figuring out a puzzle
[12:07:24] <beasty> see
[12:07:29] <sean`> a domains dns points to server A
[12:07:38] <sean`> directadmin shows the domain and the files on server A
[12:07:47] <beasty> if you mention drunk and sean` in one sentence :p
[12:07:50] <sean`> however,w hen you change something, it doesn't hae any effect
[12:08:11] <beasty> permissions ?
[12:08:18] <beasty> checking against the right nameserver ?
[12:08:38] <sean`> beasty, dns lookups point the same
[12:08:45] <sean`> no, it's weird
[12:08:48] <sean`> but i'll check it out tomorrow
[12:09:21] <beasty> drunk time ?
[12:10:17] <Aidanie> If I'm generating a number of buttons each with a unique id i.e button0,button1,....,button100. What would be the best way to attach .clicks to each button?
[12:11:45] <polorix> Aidanie: Sexual favors
[12:11:57] <xp_prg> hahah
[12:12:26] <jesly> Aidanie: the actions of each button differs??
[12:12:31] <polorix> "aw babe please, just the tip"
[12:12:45] <polorix> ok i should go back to work
[12:12:52] <xp_prg> I try this in ie 9: console.log(jQuery.browser); then it says jQuery is undefined
[12:12:54] <polorix> but the all stars in #css can't answer my question :(
[12:13:08] <Aidanie> jesly: Yes, each button is used for a seperate form, I've got to make a differing get request with each click
[12:13:52] <jesly> Aidanie: and all hundred forms happen to be same page?? jesus!!
[12:14:14] <Aidanie> jesly: Won't be 100. Just a rather large example ;-)
[12:14:31] <jesly> lol, wokay can u give a min??
[12:14:40] <Aidanie> cool!
[12:14:48] <litwol> Poetro: got a link to something new uber cool examinery that you made with js since i got the boot? always inspired me seeing what you could do with js and still dare to call yourself not a developer ;)
[12:16:06] <Aidanie> jesly: I have an idea. I'll attach it to the class and then grab the ID when it's clicked. I can uniquely identify it that way :)
[12:16:31] <litwol> Poetro: oh. there is certainly a question mark at the end of above statement :)
[12:16:33] <jesly> Aidanie: yea, thats wot the first thing that came to my mind
[12:16:34] <kanzie> Im running my web app with query 1.4.4 just fine, but if I upgrade to 1.7.1 it leaks memory like crazy from $.parseXML() or $.ajax(). Is there any way I can upgrade to 1.7.1 and keep the old versions way of doing $.ajax()
[12:16:43] <Aidanie> jesly: Thanks for your help!
[12:16:53] <jesly> Aidanie: still u got write up function for everything
[12:17:07] <jesly> try going up for a single function,
[12:17:11] <jesly> using switch
[12:17:15] <Poetro> litwol: other then the mobile site?
[12:17:19] <Poetro> it has a bunch of JS
[12:17:23] <Poetro> like the carousels
[12:17:39] <Tomashe> hey guys, for some reason i cannt check for :checked $(this,':checked').length
[12:17:45] <Tomashe> anyone knows a good way to check for checked
[12:17:54] <Aidanie>  No need, it's all handled back end, I'll just have to grab the last char of the id and throw it off in a .get and I'm done
[12:18:03] <Aidanie> Buttons are generated by my framework
[12:18:14] <xp_prg> I figured it out!!!
[12:18:21] <Poetro> Tomashe: it is the other way around
[12:18:25] <xp_prg> if ($.browser.msie) {
[12:18:33] <litwol> Poetro: you know ... heh. working with you guys spoiled me lol. got me used to "site launch 1.0" be such a grandiose thing that wheni launched my own site (me being only dev) i couldn't help but feel bitterness that it didnt live up to the large tech team standard :'(
[12:18:39] <Tomashe> poetro what u mean?
[12:19:05] <jesly> AIdanie then $('.class'){$.aja{ data:this.id}} is enuf
[12:19:11] <Poetro> Tomashe: $(':checked', this) but that is FAR from optimal...
[12:19:16] <Tomashe> ohhi c
[12:19:17] <Tomashe> :)
[12:19:21] <Aidanie> jesly: yup! :) thanks.
[12:19:36] <jesly> AIdanie: np
[12:19:58] <Poetro> Tomashe: maybe $(this).is(':checked')
[12:19:59] <polorix> Aidanie: clearly jesly was smarter about taking it out to dinner first. Always a safe good move before the sexual favors
[12:20:41] <Tomashe> hmm
[12:20:43] <jesly> plorix: wink :P
[12:21:01] <Tomashe> if ($(this).is(':checked')) {
[12:21:05] <Tomashe> so this should work?
[12:21:20] <Tomashe> its always see it as checked :/
[12:21:43] <Tomashe> ohh wait
[12:21:51] <Tomashe> if ($(this).is(':checked')==true) { that was working

[12:28:09] <digicyc> What would be a good way to ZebraStripe a table that is generated via ajax calls in which some <tr>'s are prepended and others appended.
[12:29:12] <digicyc> Using nth-child selector and for some reason because rows are being appended and prepended all look even to tr:nth-child(even) in which it's adding the class that styles them as so.
[12:29:41] <digicyc> Something to do with prepend is messing up nth-child it seems.
[12:30:04] <chuwiey> hello all, is there any way for me to remove a css height from an element all together? (not just change its value)
[12:30:15] <chuwiey> or any style for that matter...?
[12:30:21] <nickelnick> just not put height?
[12:30:22] <warrenparsons> digicyc: Are you grabbing a new nth-child reference whenever a row is appended/prepended?
[12:30:52] <chuwiey> nickelnick: already been defined.. I now want to remove that definition when a user clicks on a link
[12:30:52] <digicyc> warrenparsons: I'm not even calling nth-child till after the data is fully populated in the table(s)
[12:31:19] <digicyc> only one of the tables I'm doing a prepend on which seems to mess up that nth-child call that happens at the end.
[12:31:21] <nickelnick> how do you want to remove it?
[12:31:25] <nickelnick> at page load?
[12:31:33] <chuwiey> nickelnick: on click
[12:31:41] <digicyc> another table on the same page that I'm prepending to is striping just fine though with the same nth-child call on it.
[12:31:42] <nickelnick> i'm guessing it's something you can't change yourself
[12:32:01] <nickelnick> well spose not..hold up a sec
[12:32:05] <warrenparsons> digicyc: Sounds weird. .prepend() should be acting on the DOM as it exists when .prepend() is called. Have you verified the new elements are being added in a valid manner?
[12:32:26] <warrenparsons> digicyc: Sorry, nth-child not .prepend
[12:32:52] <digicyc> warrenparsons: Yeah in firebug the tables look all good to me. Cept all of them in this particular table have the class which is styling em the same isntead of every other one.
[12:33:36] <digicyc> The markup looks like <table><tr>Row info</tr><tbody> </tbody></table>
[12:33:38] <warrenparsons> digicyc: What I would do is View Generated Source in FF, then copy/paste that into the W3C validator, see if it comes back with any errors.
[12:33:43] <digicyc> Which I'm appending/prepending to the tbody
[12:33:57] <digicyc> warrenparsons: kk will try that now. Thank you ^_^
[12:34:05] <warrenparsons> digicyc: Yep.
[12:34:08] <chuwiey> nickelnick: or maybe I can reset the element back to its original css settings? as defined by the stylesheet...?
[12:34:19] <nickelnick> chu: $('.someTarget').click(function(){$(this).attr('height', '0')};
[12:34:53] <nickelnick> $('.someTarget').click(function(){$(this).css('height', '0')}; maybe
[12:34:58] <chuwiey> nickelnick: preferrably I would set height to auto and not 0, thereby cancelling out the option of having my elements disappear with overflow...
[12:35:08] <Zzaichik> nooooo
[12:35:16] <nickelnick> oh gotcha
[12:35:26] <Zzaichik> okay .css() is acceptable.  don't do .attr() for height.
[12:35:31] <nickelnick> however you need, that would be the formula i would use
[12:35:33] <Zzaichik> gross
[12:35:45] <rcrossan> seeking assistance on handling more than 1 jquery in script. My script doesn't execute and times out when there is more than one. I'm thinking I need a way to end one before starting another?  https://gist.github.com/1926854
[12:35:59] <nickelnick> hey chu, you can also use .animate
[12:36:37] <nickelnick> or slide up/down depending
[12:36:39] <chuwiey> nickelnick: yeah, I did that originally, but the problem is, I am using the masonry plugin - and for some reason, once I reload the div with new items and ask masonry to do its work, I get an overflow problem.
[12:37:03] <nickelnick> I have not used masonry sorry
[12:37:10] <chuwiey> nickelnick: :)
[12:37:40] <nickelnick> are you using overflow: hidden where appropriate?
[12:37:48] <nickelnick> in your css
[12:38:14] <chuwiey> nickelnick: how can I make sure? do you have a rtfm link for me? :)
[12:38:35] <nickelnick> http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_overflow.asp
[12:38:51] <nickelnick> try messing with overflow: none on that div thats causing problems
[12:38:54] <nickelnick> err hidden
[12:39:01] <chuwiey> thanks :)
[12:39:10] <nickelnick> i ran into that the other day
[12:39:26] <nickelnick> so it's semi fresh in my head
[12:39:51] <chuwiey> nickelnick: thanks for trying to help :) will read...
[12:40:27] <nickelnick> i have got through some messes thanks to IRC, i don't mind paying it back when i can
[12:41:01] <nickelnick> the dudes in jquery and php have been great resources for years
[12:41:20] <digicyc> I've gotten _INTO_ messes thanks to IRC too. hehe ;)
[12:41:26] <chuwiey> hehe
[12:41:28] <nickelnick> absolutely...
[12:41:40] <nickelnick> but, at least you were't sitting there thumb up your ass stuck on it
[12:41:51] <nickelnick> and eventually...you learned. the hard way. sometimes the better way
[12:42:10] <digicyc> but it's an amazing resource which shows since it's a pretty old concept soon after BBS' o_O
[12:42:28] <nickelnick> i miss bbs....
[12:42:31] <nickelnick> duke nukem 3d
[12:42:39] <nickelnick> 33.6kbps
[12:43:05] <digicyc> duke nukem 3d over a bbs? o_O
[12:43:18] <nickelnick> yea, it was awesome
[12:43:20] <digicyc> 3d cause it had an Ascii map?
[12:43:23] <digicyc> ;)
[12:43:23] <nickelnick> choppy at times
[12:43:30] <digicyc> bbs != dialup
[12:43:36] <digicyc> bbs = dialIN
[12:43:43] <nickelnick> nah, it was like a first person like quake
[12:43:46] <zatan> hi, can anyone look at my animation, and can tell why my first animation is not so nice, as you click a second time ? http://jsfiddle.net/hey4R/
[12:44:06] <nickelnick> too fast you mean?
[12:44:17] <zatan> nickelnick, yeah exactly :)
[12:45:24] <nickelnick> http://jsfiddle.net/hey4R/2/
[12:45:26] <nickelnick> try that
[12:46:02] <nickelnick> might need to mess with it a bit
[12:46:14] <nickelnick> on that last value for animate
[12:46:38] <CharlieM75> I'm using a flexbox, and I want to disable the drop down button, is there a jQuery'ish way to accomplish this? If i remove the class, it removes the whole icon, I just want to remove the click event or however it is working behind the scenes
[12:48:18] <zatan> nickelnick, no its still the same when you press a first time after refresh, I think its shomething to do with   $('#topbar').show();  as its show all bar and just then starts animate from that position
[12:48:51] <Zzaichik> .stop()
[12:49:02] <nickelnick> oh like its not catching your click every time to close it?
[12:49:06] <CharlieM75> tried throwing a .click(function() { return false; }) on it and no go
[12:50:25] <nickelnick> maybe toggle the div with active class
[12:50:46] <nickelnick> so when click comes thru, you can determine if it needs to be pushed up or down
[12:50:55] <nickelnick> and then animate it based on that
[12:51:50] <Tomashe> will that work? $(".GIMG img[imageid=".pid."]").parent().addClass("GIMGB2");
[12:52:15] <Tomashe> missing name after . operator
[12:52:29] <nickelnick> the problem i think is that your caught in that delay regardless of you click or not
[12:52:50] <litwol> Is it possible to "compile" jquery library that strictly includes only the components i want? for example i want selectors, data, and ajax related functionality and absolutely nothing else
[12:53:15] <zatan> nickelnick, you can see from this I put return false, and its stop on that place, where its start animate from
[12:53:40] <litwol> similar to how jqueryui lets you dl individual modules/components
[12:54:35] <Tomashe> ok fixed i tried to use . instead of + :)
[12:54:47] <Tomashe> another issue is : $(".SELECTAL input[type=checkbox]").each(function(data) {	if (data.is(':checked')===true) {
[12:54:53] <litwol> although 31kb doens't sound too bad i suppose
[12:54:54] <Tomashe> i keep getting data is not a function :/
[12:58:28] <nickelnick> zatan, i gotta work on this ticket man good luck to you tho
[12:58:50] <zatan> nickelnick, cheers
[13:05:27] <jeffreylevesque> anyone free to take a look at my jquery rotator?

[13:06:15] <jeffreylevesque> that's my live rotator
[13:06:18] <litwol> why are you reinventing the wheel ?
[13:06:24] <jeffreylevesque> once the fourth rotator is hit
[13:06:31] <jeffreylevesque> it does't cycle through
[13:06:56] <litwol> jeffreylevesque: http://sorgalla.com/projects/jcarousel/examples/static_auto.html
[13:07:05] <jeffreylevesque> thanks
[13:07:16] <jeffreylevesque> i'm only one small prob away
[13:07:18] <litwol> there are plenty existing carousel libs out there
[13:07:31] <jeffreylevesque> our cms is a little weird
[13:07:36] <jeffreylevesque> so i decided to write my own
[13:07:45] <jeffreylevesque> if it was drupal, piece of cake
[13:07:59] <litwol> not a good excuse
[13:17:13] <cook1es> I've figured out my userscript basically unloads all functions loaded on the site when I implement jQuery in the userscript itself, how can I prevent this?
[13:19:01] <cook1es> I should specify, it unloads all jQuery additions, like jQuery UI and another plugin called Superfish.
[13:23:24] <okamxulp> hi
[13:23:36] <FrameFever> hi
[13:23:58] <FrameFever> I have a div, and when this div is resized in its width, I want to resize some other div
[13:24:01] <FrameFever> how can I do this?
[13:25:47] <cook1es> FrameFever: http://api.jquery.com/resize/
[13:27:33] <FrameFever> cook1es: I have following problem
[13:27:57] <FrameFever> I have a div with fixed height, and I need to adjust this height to keep the aspect ratio
[13:28:41] <johnkpaul> FrameFever: Does it also have a fixed width?
[13:28:48] <FrameFever> no
[13:28:50] <DerekPioneer> i'm having a weird problem jquery ui, draggable in IE8, the draggable boxes only recognize when they're being hovered on if i put the mouse directly on the border of the box
[13:28:53] <DerekPioneer> any ideas what that could be?
[13:29:16] <friendlycello> I'd like to view an event listener in the DOM that I attached with a .keydown() function.  I'm not finding a place to see it in Firebug... any suggestions?
[13:29:30] <FrameFever> johnkpaul: the width is dynamic
[13:29:44] <okamxulp> Does anyone know a channel I can go to for questions about SQL? #SQL doesn't allow me to say anything :o
[13:31:08] <johnkpaul> FrameFever: then why not set the width explicitly to maintain whatever ratio you want
[13:31:22] <johnkpaul> DerekPioneer: you're sure you aren't disabling any pointer events?
[13:31:50] <DerekPioneer> pretty sure
[13:32:58] <StevenCodes221> Can anoyone check where I can go to access my ssh on my site
[13:33:28] <FrameFever> johnkpaul: here is my testcase
[13:33:29] <FrameFever> http://jsfiddle.net/L8Wp3/102/
[13:34:06] <jeffsmykil> I have an ajax call that brings in a number of times and corresponding temperatures.  I've been trying all afternoon to store them in an object using a for loop and .push() that matches this format: [[300, 25], [200, 12.5]]
[13:34:07] <FrameFever> what I now want is, when you resize the whole page, the images should also shrink
[13:34:15] <johnkpaul> ooh
[13:34:21] <jeffsmykil> Every time I do it I get the pairs in quotations
[13:34:23] <johnkpaul> css media queries
[13:34:24] <FrameFever> but keep of course the aspect ratio
[13:34:24] <johnkpaul> is what you want then
[13:34:39] <johnkpaul> or, do you want it to be proportionally?
[13:34:52] <FrameFever> it should be totally fluid
[13:35:22] <FrameFever> with media queries I can only set steps
[13:35:46] <johnkpaul> FrameFever: should it always be some percentage of the width and height of the container?
[13:36:34] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Have you examined the returned values to make sure they're not strings before pushing them to the object?
[13:36:37] <FrameFever> max height is 300px
[13:37:05] <FrameFever> the "#container" is used for the animation of the images
[13:37:24] <jeffsmykil> this is my latest attempt warrenparsons temperatureObject.push("[" + newDate + "," + parseInt(temp[i].Temperature) + "]") ;
[13:38:35] <jeffsmykil> which gives me this ["[1330318800000,14]", "[1330322400000,14]"]
[13:38:58] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Not the source of your problem, but you always want to pass a radix argument to parseInt, otherwise you can end up with unintentional base8 numbers.
[13:40:08] <johnkpaul> FrameFever: if you have the maxheight at 300px, how can it change with the size of the page?
[13:40:08] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Have you tried leaveing the quotes off? .push([newDate, parseInt(temp[i].Temperature)])
[13:40:19] <FrameFever> johnkpaul: sorry
[13:40:20] <jeffsmykil> i thought of it
[13:40:31] <FrameFever> I mean 150px
[13:40:36] <FrameFever> but thats is only an example
[13:40:42] <jeffsmykil> but it doesnt work
[13:41:05] <jeffsmykil> still get the quotes
[13:41:23] <FrameFever> johnkpaul: but you get the idea, what I want?
[13:41:26] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Are you trying to end up with an array or an object with named keys?
[13:41:45] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: an object
[13:42:00] <jeffsmykil> but the keys arent named
[13:42:22] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: http://people.iola.dk/olau/flot/examples/time.html
[13:43:00] <jeffsmykil> ive tried keys but that doesnt work either
[13:43:04] <johnkpaul> FrameFever: I don't really know
[13:43:46] <FrameFever> but you know what i want?
[13:44:05] <johnkpaul> sort of, you want an image to grow and shrink with the size of the widnow
[13:44:09] <johnkpaul> but you want a max-height
[13:44:11] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: A series can either be raw data or an object with properties. The raw
[13:44:12] <jeffsmykil> data format is an array of points:
[13:44:15] <johnkpaul> but you want the aspect ratio to not change
[13:44:17] <johnkpaul> which is confusing
[13:44:45] <FrameFever> than you dont understand what I want
[13:44:59] <FrameFever> its pretty simple
[13:45:08] <FrameFever> I have an image slider places in a container
[13:45:11] <FrameFever> placed
[13:45:32] <FrameFever> now, when I resize the page, all the image should resize to the new width
[13:45:47] <FrameFever> but of course keep its aspect ratio
[13:45:52] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: im desperate even if you just tell me im a moron
[13:45:53] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: Well, an object is enclosed with {}, while an array is enclosed with []. In your example, you've got an array. I think what you want is { {-363056400000, 315.86}, … } And .push() is for adding items to an array, not an object.
[13:46:36] <warrenparsons> jeffsmykil: This kind of data work isn't my main focus, unfortunately.
[13:47:15] <johnkpaul> FrameFever: something like this http://jsfiddle.net/L8Wp3/104/?
[13:47:19] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: thanks anyways
[13:47:26] <jeffsmykil> warrenparsons: aybe a nights sleep will help me

[13:52:45] <denemetest> hi
[13:54:57] <denemetest> i have a problem with jquery+json+php+mysql
[13:56:13] <yedimind> oh yeah?
[13:56:15] <denemetest> i am posing a request for Request.php and i wanna grab data ( result  json )
[13:56:51] <cyberalien> http://ch.php.net/json_decode
[13:56:51] <Wyo_Segfault> I'm on a team converting our IE/VB.net products over to crossbrowser, and I ran into a problem with the :disabled property.  We apply that to any type of element because IE will disallow clicking on (for example) <table> or <td> elements if they have a disabled property active.  Now when I try to identify disabled elements, e.g. $(":disabled") it fails to locate any elements so flagged.  Say we have <table id="foo" disabled="disabled">... not only wil
[13:56:52] <Wyo_Segfault> l $(":disabled") come up empty, but $("#foo").prop("disabled") also comes up undefined.  Any recommendations on a workaround, short of changing five bazillion existing uses to a different keyword?
[13:57:07] <denemetest> is there any document ( or example ) for understanding jquery and json ?
[13:57:50] <Wyo_Segfault> denemetest: A good starting place is http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp
[13:58:01] <Wyo_Segfault> They also have json tutorials
[13:58:05] <cyberalien> If you want to parse JSON data in jQuery, check out $.parseJSON function
[13:58:19] <denemetest> cyberalien: i want to grab result without after post
[13:58:28] <denemetest> i will check @cyberalien
[13:58:30] <johnkpaul> FrameFever: what do you mean attach to the resize?
[13:58:49] <nobitanobi> How can I remove the tr parent element when an input is clicked, given that the input is inside a td child element? http://jsfiddle.net/DZYns/1/
[13:59:33] <johnkpaul> nobitanobi: http://jsfiddle.net/DZYns/2/
[13:59:41] <johnkpaul> $(this).parents("tr").remove()
[14:00:05] <denemetest> $.post("request.php", {"type": type, "id": id, "data": data});
[14:00:08] <nobitanobi> thanks johnkpaul
[14:00:24] <denemetest> this is sending a post request from request.php and i want to grab what its results
[14:00:56] <cyberalien> denemetest: add 'dataType': 'json' to $.post
[14:01:14] <cyberalien> and jquery will automatically convert result from json string to object
[14:01:20] <cooooooter> anyone wanna share some light on a way I can get this to work: http://jsfiddle.net/D4MAW/
[14:01:46] <cooooooter> its console.logging an empty array, when it should have 1 object in it
[14:01:56] <denemetest> and how can i grab request.php  results  ?
[14:02:16] <cooooooter> the .getJSON() isnt finishing before it trys to console.log
[14:02:35] <cyberalien> denemetest: add 'success' event to your request
[14:03:16] <denemetest> ( request.php creates a json object  i want to send it to another function )
[14:05:34] <cyberalien> $.post('request.php', {'type': type, 'id': id, 'data': data, 'dataType': 'json', 'success': function(data, textStatus, jqXFR) { yourFunction(data) }});

[14:45:41] <someish> I'm pretty new to jQuery so I apologize in advance. I do a mysql select, convert that data to json using php's json_encode function, then display it in a view. I then use the jquery .each() to iterate over the json; however I'm recieving "undefined" as the value. What might this mean in this context?

[14:50:44] <someish> jrockjiggz: and the returned content-type is json
[14:50:57] <jrockjiggz> someish: you have the idea right, could be something simple.. post your jquery code?
[14:51:01] <jrockjiggz> jsfiddle.net
[14:51:15] <djsounds02> http://pastebin.com/W90D9P1s
[14:51:19] <djsounds02> SHould this work?
[14:51:27] <djsounds02> because its not..
[14:52:55] <nFFF> djsounds02, that's valid jQuery
[14:53:06] <nFFF> without seeing your markup can't tell you if it's gonna work
[14:53:09] <nFFF> ya dig?
[14:53:13] <nFFF> ?jsfiddle
[14:53:21] <jrockjiggz> ?p
[14:54:05] <diegoviola> any ideas please?
[14:54:06] <jrockjiggz> someish: this might be of help to you http://www.jquery4u.com/json/ajaxjquery-getjson-simple/
[14:54:18] <djsounds02> nFFF: http://pastebin.com/RC57Njwm
[14:54:24] <nFFF> diegoviola, you can make it yourself
[14:54:28] <nFFF> or google for aplugin
[14:54:33] <nFFF> sure there is one
[14:54:48] <nFFF> djsounds02
[14:54:52] <nFFF> www.jsfiddle.net
[14:54:56] <diegoviola> ok ty
[14:54:57] <nFFF> make a working example
[14:55:18] <someish> jrockjiggz: http://pastebin.com/8HAVhB3C
[14:55:27] <djsounds02> ok
[14:56:06] <someish> jrockjiggz: I'm pretty confident the issue has to do with the way the array is structured and how I'm iterating over it...but I can't figure it out.
[14:56:13] <djsounds02> nFFF: I have it live if that helps?
[14:56:23] <nFFF> someish, you need to convert to an array
[14:56:30] <nFFF> you have an object
[14:56:35] <jrockjiggz> someish: is addTag() a plugin?
[14:56:44] <someish> jrockjiggz: yes
[14:56:56] <nFFF> djsounds02, jsfiddle.net is the best pastebin
[14:57:05] <nFFF> literaly you could have just used that instead of pastebin
[14:57:06] <djsounds02> nFFF http://kubeonedesign.co.uk/petfood/shop/dog-food/#
[14:57:08] <nFFF> and people could fix it for you
[14:57:27] <djsounds02> its php calls to the database though!
[14:57:34] <someish> nFFF: Why do I have to convert it to an array?
[14:57:46] <djsounds02> and then all the images hosted on a server
[14:57:59] <djsounds02> they arent absolute links
[14:58:45] <sphinxxx_> is this syntax right:  .on("click", function(e){
[14:58:58] <djsounds02> nFFF: will that live link be ok?
[14:59:20] <jrockjiggz> sphinxxx_: yes
[14:59:36] <nFFF> someish, Im not sure you can iterate through an object like that
[14:59:50] <nFFF> Unless you have a bunch of objects
[15:00:10] <someish> nFFF: http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.each/ states that it can iterate over objects and arrays
[15:00:47] <jrockjiggz> someish: try this.width,this.height
[15:01:28] <djsounds02> nFFF: http://jsfiddle.net/Cq2jy/
[15:02:03] <someish> jrockjiggz: no luck
[15:02:41] <jrockjiggz> inside each function, console.log(tag)
[15:02:57] <nFFF> someish, sorry your correct, I thought perhaps your object was too complicated
[15:03:26] <someish> nFFF: no worries.
[15:04:22] <djsounds02> nFFF: did you get the link bud
[15:05:08] <nFFF> yes
[15:05:11] <nFFF> your first issue is
[15:05:17] <nFFF> extraFoods
[15:05:18] <someish> jrockjiggz: I'm not sure what you mean by that last comment.
[15:05:20] <nFFF> isn't a parent?
[15:05:39] <nFFF> someish, where is your script breaking
[15:05:43] <djsounds02> what is it if not a parent
[15:05:46] <nFFF> is it iterating over the object find
[15:06:31] <jrockjiggz> inside your each function, use console.log(tag) to see what data the tag is
[15:06:49] <nFFF> parent parent
[15:06:51] <djsounds02> nFFF: change anything required
[15:06:59] <djsounds02> Ill work around you
[15:07:24] <but> list
[15:09:01] <someish> jrockjiggz: jQuery(div#tag1.jTagTag)
[15:10:24] <nFFF> djsounds02, sec
[15:11:10] <nFFF> its not even a parent
[15:12:07] <djsounds02> nFFF: I really struggle with jquery its something im learning
[15:12:14] <polorix> oksushi: sup sexy? How you doooin?

[15:22:24] <nickelnick> feels like you got that header out of a microsoft office too
[15:22:26] <prometh> setInterval(animateClouds, 6000); animateClouds();
[15:22:49] <surfdue> ah

[15:23:05] <nickelnick> saturn: font also, generally i think shoul dbe smaller
[15:23:36] <nickelnick> saturn: also you need to give your image a bit of margin.

[15:32:02] <surfdue> Any floating ideas
[15:32:47] <surfdue> I need to make someone look like its floating in place.
[15:34:14] <nFFF> djsounds02
[15:34:17] <nFFF> change your markup
[15:34:25] <nFFF> and use next() to find the next hidden list
[15:34:26] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/Cq2jy/3/
[15:34:32] <djsounds02> nFFF: I have changed my markup
[15:35:54] <nFFF> ok great :)
[15:36:59] <djsounds02> nFFF: what did you change in the markup on jsfiddle
[15:37:10] <djsounds02> cos now the link just dissapears
[15:37:14] <djsounds02> and no drop down
[15:38:56] <surfdue> Why wont the UI bounce direction work, just ignores.. $('.imageCloudCabinet').effect("bounce", { times: 3, directon: "right", distance: 10 }, 10000);
[15:38:58] <surfdue> still going up..
[15:39:17] <benji__> Hi, how could I do to launch a local HTML/JS file on my local machine (file:///tmp/test.html) that will go check the availability of a website (cross domain question)
[15:42:01] <djsounds02> nFFF: got it bud thanks very much for your time Ive even learnt a bit from you which is always fantastic
[15:44:31] <nFFF> np
[15:45:46] <djsounds02> Do you know the reason it wouldnt work inside the li?
[15:46:03] <nFFF> Yea
[15:46:12] <nFFF> You could get it to work inside the li
[15:46:19] <nFFF> but youd be going all over the DOM tree
[15:46:31] <someprimetime> benji__: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/cors/ check that out
[15:46:52] <nFFF> You had markup like this <parent><child><child>
[15:47:20] <nFFF> And you wanted to get the <parent><sibling><child>
[15:50:19] <nFFF> http://jsfiddle.net/Cq2jy/4/
[15:50:32] <nFFF> This would work with the original markup
[15:54:48] <benji__> someprimetime, it keeps answering "Woops, there was an error making the request."
[16:00:52] <nFFF> CORS is pretty cool
[16:12:20] <lionmac> how to reload a div when a button is clicked
[16:12:40] <lionmac> without refreshing :)
[16:15:10] <nFFF> reload
[16:15:11] <nFFF> ?
[16:15:57] <tw2113> i assume change out the html
[16:26:36] <benji__> why do I have errors like "jQuery16104361428285483271_1330388764912 was not called" ?
[16:26:46] <benji__> when trying to do a jsonp request
[16:29:29] <imsky> because life is hard
[16:30:10] <benji__> that was funny
[16:36:02] <tw2113> i lol'd inside
[16:36:14] <bytesize> ^
[16:37:15] <tw2113> strangely enough, it sounded like the crying of a single lonely guy
[16:37:22] <tw2113> *shakes that off* nothing to worry about
[16:41:50] <FrEaKmAn_> hi.. using autocomplete, can I define that results populate custom element?
[16:52:31] <KevlarSoul>  how can I make each of these fade in and fade out on click of the next item, so that they never click to white  http://jsfiddle.net/KnExN/  cant figure out how to name the (this) portions
[16:54:53] <felixqc> KevlarSoul: what do you mean?
[16:55:01] <someprimetime> ++
[16:55:10] <someprimetime> click to white? wat
[16:55:36] <KevlarSoul> Like
[16:55:56] <KevlarSoul> when I click it first of all it fades the wrong thing, it fades the list item
[16:56:05] <KevlarSoul> and it fades it and doesnt fade in another choice
[16:56:48] <felixqc> you don't want the li to fade... just the div?
[16:57:22] <KevlarSoul> right
[16:57:32] <KevlarSoul> Im confused as to how to setup the (this)
[16:57:58] <KevlarSoul> and then to get it to go to the next div and not fade to white
[16:58:31] <felixqc> like; http://jsfiddle.net/KnExN/2/
[16:59:22] <KevlarSoul> I need to make the fade stop working on the list, and only on the div
[16:59:27] <KevlarSoul> I guess first of all
[16:59:34] <danpsy> I have a method that looks like this: http://ideone.com/D0vip  "called" is never displayed, what could be the problem?  If I have an alert outside of the function (data) block, the method is called, so the browser isn't stopping execution.
[17:00:14] <felixqc> oh
[17:01:30] <KevlarSoul> can I had a modifier after funcion that will make it fade or something like that
[17:01:31] <KevlarSoul> ?
[17:02:28] <danpsy> It seems that I using onComplete: function (data) now calls the method and calls the alert("called"); line, but "data" returns undefined
[17:02:29] <KevlarSoul> like maybe fadeTransition ?
[17:11:15] <]Darker[> hi guys :)
[17:11:52] <]Darker[> I am looking for a good jquery carousel plugin that automatically resize the imgs in fullscreen
[17:11:55] <]Darker[> any suggestions?
[17:12:01] <LittleFoot> i made one

[17:14:43] <KevlarSoul>         if (!next.length) { next = $('#nav0');
[17:14:43] <KevlarSoul>         next.fadeIn(600);
[17:15:09] <KevlarSoul> if I dont have an li
[17:15:14] <KevlarSoul> but a id's
[17:15:30] <KevlarSoul> should I replace the li with a id=
[17:17:10] <KevlarSoul> http://jsfiddle.net/KnExN/12/
[17:18:53] <alexr2> KevlarSoul, you need to format  your code properly, you're missing a bunch of closing }
[17:19:46] <KevlarSoul> and the end of the function line?
[17:21:20] <KevlarSoul> http://jsfiddle.net/KnExN/15/
[17:23:12] <KevlarSoul> okay I took off my piss poor attempt to put in some fading
[17:23:12] <KevlarSoul> http://jsfiddle.net/KnExN/19/
[17:23:29] <KevlarSoul> at least I get the divs to change
[17:24:04] <KevlarSoul> If I put 'slow' will that give a nice transition , or are there other options?
[17:25:58] <KevlarSoul> like this
[17:25:59] <KevlarSoul> http://jsfiddle.net/KnExN/22/
[17:26:11] <KevlarSoul> it kind of opens up fromo the corner
[17:26:13] <KevlarSoul> meh
[17:26:32] <felixqc> http://jsfiddle.net/KnExN/23/
[17:26:38] <felixqc> maybe try it on the callback
[17:26:54] <felixqc> i added an empty div to wrap all the divs, and call siblings()
[17:27:12] <KevlarSoul> interesting
[17:27:36] <KevlarSoul> see what I did with the 'slow'? http://jsfiddle.net/KnExN/22/
[17:27:40] <KevlarSoul> what do you think of that
[17:28:14] <KevlarSoul> why does urs look like it blounces downward first?
[17:28:19] <KevlarSoul> bounces
[17:28:43] <felixqc> you have to fadein in the callback
[17:28:52] <felixqc> or add a .stop()
[17:28:56] <KevlarSoul> I removed the list, my site wont be a list just some buttons
[17:29:33] <felixqc> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=fadeout+on+siblings+fadein+after
[17:30:38] <KevlarSoul> lol
[17:30:40] <KevlarSoul> thanks.
[17:30:54] <zachduffy> When using datepicker, how do you make mindate and defaultdate be the current day?
[17:32:44] <felixqc> http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#option-minDate
[17:34:55] <zduffy> Yeah I figured it out, I was editing the wrong date picker lol
[17:35:26] <felixqc> $( ".selector" ).datepicker({ minDate: new Date() });
[17:35:28] <felixqc> ;)
[17:48:09] <abjorn> imsky my wiggla
[17:48:45] <imsky> abjorn u cad
[17:50:03] <abjorn> kind of like how for the past week I've been thinking
[17:50:06] <abjorn> "jQuery UI, you cad"
[17:50:16] <abjorn> and by cad I mean "insufferable, buggy annoyance"
[17:50:19] <imsky> lol
[17:51:01] <abjorn> I basically wrote a complete wrapper around .dialog() that adds a bunch of bullshit bugfixes for all the sizing/resizing flaws
[17:51:13] <abjorn> because I got tired of it's shit
[17:51:22] <abjorn> if I say minWidth is 800, it's 800 dammit!
[17:51:36] <imsky> you sound like a crazy homeless dude
[17:51:53] <abjorn> I don't even
[17:51:54] <abjorn> what
[17:52:19] <abjorn> lol that reminds me
[17:52:41] <abjorn> we get free lunch at work, and there's a whole rating system for it so we can rate and leave comments so they know what to get/what not to get in the future
[17:52:51] <abjorn> and apparently someone fucked up and had to get taco bell at the last second
[17:52:53] <abjorn> them ratings
[17:52:56] <abjorn> them ratings were awful
[17:53:04] <abjorn> everyone hated it cause taco bell sucks lol
[17:53:21] <abjorn> and someone left a comment "I TOOK A BUNCH OF BURRITOS AND GAVE THEM TO THE HOMELESS EVEN THOUGH THEY ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH PROBLEMS"
[17:53:40] <imsky> lol
[17:53:57] <abjorn> homeless people hang out around where we're at
[17:54:11] <abjorn> east austin, YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH
[17:54:12] <imsky> austin texas, third coast born and raised
[17:54:34] <abjorn> homeless people up in this bitch
[17:54:43] <imsky> homeless yet articulate
[17:54:55] <abjorn> homeless yet they have macbooks
[17:54:56] <imsky> you see the spazz out on twitter today about the github dude?
[17:55:02] <imsky> zach something
[17:55:04] <abjorn> and art degrees
[17:55:08] <abjorn> no?
[17:55:48] <imsky> https://twitter.com/#!/garannm/status/174221747778895872
[17:55:49] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from garannm: HOLY SHIT. This is appalling. http://t.co/x9ClHG6U ★ http://bit.ly/wYgMop
[17:56:49] <imsky> tldr: github bro hangs out in poorly lit interview room with a brewski, talking to two "designer/blogger" types about his pickup lines: can i get into your pants?
[17:57:11] <abjorn> what.
[17:57:18] <abjorn> I'm confuse
[17:57:20] <imsky> then elaborates on some creepy dating scenario with manipulative precision
[17:57:21] <imsky> yeah
[17:57:38] <imsky> quoted: "I’m saying “I’m just kidding” to lower the barrier and the “maybe” to  say actually… I wasn’t kidding. Now come jump on my train! (We’d say  Zach just nailed the interview. He’s hired)."
[17:58:17] <imsky> the video is like awkward central
[17:58:25] <abjorn> what's most disturbing about this is the person writing this blog post
[17:58:30] <imsky> people*
[17:58:34] <abjorn> people whatever
[17:58:43] <imsky> and yeah they freak me out
[17:58:45] <abjorn> "It was truly a treat interviewing this piece of man candy." the fuck?
[17:58:49] <abjorn> im creeped out
[17:58:52] <imsky> i don't get this whole "we don't know how to code but we're all about tech" thing
[17:59:20] <imsky> i guess owning a macbook makes you a goddamn veteran software engineer in the valley
[17:59:27] <abjorn> "I don't know how to configure my BIOS, but I love tech"
[17:59:28] <zakwilson> Man candy? What job are they hiring for? Prostitute?
[17:59:51] <abjorn> wait, macs, there's no bios configuration
[17:59:57] <abjorn> NEVER NEEDED
[17:59:59] <imsky> EFI
[18:00:00] <imsky> EFI
[18:00:21] <zakwilson> I wrote a memory tester in open firmware. Am I hired?
[18:00:21] <imsky> zach about women: "My metric for humans in general is that they should have an edge of some variety. "
[18:00:32] <imsky> yes my metric for humans
[18:00:39] <imsky> for humans
[18:00:43] <imsky> HUMANS
[18:00:55] <imsky> as opposed to reptiles i guess, zach you goddamn weirdo
[18:02:18] <abjorn> reptiles is whole other ballpark
[18:02:23] <abjorn> of metrics
[18:03:21] <zakwilson> Oh, I see. It's not a job interview, but a blog interview, and they're talking about men the way men talk about women.
[18:03:37] <imsky> except the man they're talking to creeps men out
[18:03:43] <imsky> and obviously sane women too
[18:03:56] <abjorn> everyone involved creeps me out
[18:03:59] <imsky> yeah dude
[18:04:15] <imsky> i think it's best to be a little ignorant about the people in the tech industry
[18:04:22] <imsky> so many of them are maladjusted weirdos
[18:04:39] <abjorn> pretty much all of them are maladjusted in some way
[18:04:40] <abjorn> just
[18:04:43] <abjorn> not always...quite...THAT much
[18:04:49] <imsky> well to be fair
[18:04:54] <abjorn> I'm maladjusted
[18:05:00] <abjorn> putting it mildly
[18:05:02] <imsky> valley + github + designer/bloggers = shitload of douchebaggery
[18:05:07] <abjorn> lol
[18:05:16] <abjorn> + ruby
[18:05:25] <imsky> briefly considered moving my repos to a self-hosted environment after reading that interview
[18:05:27] <imsky> it was that creppy
[18:05:34] <abjorn> rofl
[18:05:51] <abjorn> as long as he gives me good results he could fuck goats and I'd still use github
[18:05:52] <imsky> you know about the whole PUA subculture?
[18:05:53] <zakwilson> I'm a maladjusted weirdo, but I'm pretty nice about it.
[18:05:59] <abjorn> no?
[18:06:04] <imsky> the dudes that like have a whole jargon for how to talk to girls
[18:06:08] <imsky> yeah this guy gives me the same vibe
[18:06:14] <ColKurtz> lol.
[18:06:17] <abjorn> OH pick up artists
[18:06:21] <ColKurtz> lol @ everybody dissecting  this blog post
[18:06:24] <abjorn> i wasnt sure what you meant by PUA at first
[18:06:33] <abjorn> dissecting isn't the word
[18:06:36] <abjorn> I didn't get very far into it
[18:06:37] <abjorn> lol
[18:06:39] <imsky> ColKurtz: the creepiness of men in tech is not oft-discussed
[18:06:50] <abjorn> except on tv
[18:06:56] <imsky> by chris hansen
[18:06:59] <ColKurtz> i think if two cute girls were coming onto me that strong i'd be like fuckitimmacreep too
[18:07:00] <zakwilson> I used to think PUAs were creepy, but I don't think that's quite it. They've systematized and written down what a few people are naturally good at.
[18:07:17] <ColKurtz> just sayin
[18:07:20] <imsky> ColKurtz: a girl on twitter outed him for being a creep
[18:07:22] <abjorn> they're all douchebags
[18:07:30] <imsky> zakwilson: no they're creepy dude.
[18:07:34] <ColKurtz> i don't think i'd want it published on the internet though
[18:07:34] <ColKurtz> lol
[18:07:52] <imsky> he's still reeling on his twitter
[18:07:55] <zakwilson> imsky: sure they are, but so are people who are naturally socially adept. You just can't see it in the latter case.
[18:08:21] <imsky> zakwilson: wat
[18:08:29] <imsky> well-adjusted people come off as creepy to you?
[18:08:48] <zakwilson> imsky: Well-adjusted people who bring home a different girl every week? Yep.
[18:09:13] <imsky> every week? that's not even baller status
[18:09:30] <abjorn> if two crazy ass girls like that ever interviewed me I'd show up hilariously underdressed (slayer t-shirt, work out pants) and answer every question in one word
[18:09:42] <abjorn> like a man
[18:10:07] <LakWork> in the context of an element inside an li: $(el).parents('li').siblings() returns "Cannot read property 'firstChild' of null"
[18:10:10] <zakwilson> Ok. Three a day? The exact numbers don't matter. The point is, the only difference is that PUAs have learned how to do it scientifically instead of just absorbing it.
[18:10:35] <danpsy> I have this file here:  http://ideone.com/W0qXh.  The alert("Data Loaded: " + data); line is never called, but the alert("passed me!"); line is.  Why isn't the alert("Data..."); line getting called?  I'm using jquery 1.7
[18:10:37] <imsky> lol you're full of shit
[18:10:42] <imsky> pua artists = scam artists
[18:11:00] <LakWork> ajpiano you about?
[18:11:10] <imsky> they teach introverted nerds how to analyze and manipulate people, which makes them come off as desperate creepy psychopaths
[18:11:42] <danpsy> I also tried using .live('click', function () instead of just .click(function ()
[18:11:56] <zakwilson> imsky: I could be wrong; I don't know any. I just read a bit about the techniques they use, and it sounded like somebody had studied a socially adept player and written down what he was doing.
[18:12:25] <imsky> zakwilson: no man. look up neil strauss, one of the biggest names. the guy is just a good fiction author. he cashed out his chips and now writes for other publications
[18:12:47] <imsky> it's one of those scam industries like internet marketing or televangelism
[18:12:49] <abjorn> danpsy: I would say that the post isn't returning then :D
[18:13:31] <abjorn> returning as in the request never returns, that is
[18:13:41] <abjorn> I'd check for an error in your console
[18:13:52] <danpsy> abjorn:  test.php doesn't exist, so I assumed it would just return the "404 page" error in the alert dialog.  Do I need to do anything special when I output my data in the php file?
[18:14:09] <zakwilson> imsky: you're saying the people selling the how-to books are scam artists? That, I wouldn't be surprised by.
[18:14:26] <abjorn> not reall,y no
[18:14:29] <danpsy> I keep seeing this error in the error console, but I'm not sure if it's related:  Error: bad script XDR magic number
[18:14:33] <imsky> zakwilson: that's all it is. there's no legitimate PUA thing. it's neil strauss, his cringe-worthy VH1 show, and a bunch of other sleazeballs
[18:14:44] <abjorn> uhhhh that's an odd error
[18:14:53] <abjorn> i dont think it's related, though
[18:15:04] <imsky> my magic number is 7
[18:15:23] <abjorn> yeah, just make sure test.php exists. the format you returned doesn't matter too much, though I would suggest returning json
[18:15:27] <zakwilson> imsky: Oh. Well, I think most people selling any kind of how-to guide are a little off at best.
[18:15:51] <imsky> except the github dude isn't selling anything
[18:16:01] <abjorn> except his penis
[18:16:02] <abjorn> to those girls
[18:16:04] <imsky> lol
[18:16:13] <imsky> $50 says nothing happened after that interview
[18:16:45] <abjorn> I doubt anything did either
[18:17:32] <zakwilson> There's nothing wrong with him trying to sell his penis to those girls. They're obviously looking.
[18:18:03] <imsky> lol watch the video
[18:18:27] <abjorn> no i refuse
[18:18:47] <ColKurtz> what happens in the video
[18:18:49] <ColKurtz> do they sit on his lap
[18:18:53] <ColKurtz> >:3
[18:19:31] <imsky> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6nt6l_iv0g&feature=player_embedded
[18:19:54] <danpsy> abjorn:  IDEOne seems to be down, so I'll compress it to one line: <?php header('Content-type: application/json'); echo('Hello, World!'); ?> is now "test.php" but sadly only the second alert is still getting called
[18:20:06] <imsky> wrong
[18:20:11] <imsky> you're not returning json
[18:20:27] <abjorn> imsky: He looks really, really smug
[18:20:45] <imsky> lol dude
[18:20:53] <imsky> guy at github smug?
[18:20:59] <imsky> nawww
[18:21:06] <danpsy> imsky:  What's the correct content-type for json?
[18:21:12] <abjorn> lol
[18:21:20] <imsky> danpsy: you're not returning json...you're just returning some bare words
[18:21:30] <imsky> {"hello":"world"}
[18:21:31] <imsky> that's json
[18:22:08] <Guddu> Kindly recommend a good solution for allowing only numeric values in a TExt Field.
[18:22:43] <ColKurtz> int()
[18:23:34] <Guddu> ColKurtz, Was that for me?
[18:23:40] <danpsy> imsky:  Ah I see, thank you.
[18:24:03] <ColKurtz> yeah but not really helpful at all
[18:24:03] <ColKurtz> lol
[18:24:36] <Guddu> :(
[18:24:37] <danpsy> I'm very confused at why the function isn't getting called though.  I tried using onComplete: function (data) { // } in it's place, the method is then called but data returns "undefined"
[18:24:48] <ColKurtz> Guddu, isNaN()
[18:25:03] <ColKurtz> returns true if a value is Not a Number
[18:25:28] <zakwilson> imsky: I'm not sure why I actually watched that. It was a little strange, but apalling?
[18:25:40] <ColKurtz> if you need to do more validation for a form i would just use jquery validate though. and it has a function for validating numbers
[18:26:39] <imsky> zakwilson: idk my bff jill
[18:26:41] <Guddu> ColKurtz, I am new to JQuery. This validation should happen as part of what event?
[18:27:02] <zakwilson> imsky: eh?
[18:27:03] <ColKurtz> Guddu, search for "jquery validate"
[18:27:06] <KevlarSoul> http://jsfiddle.net/KnExN/27/
[18:27:07] <ColKurtz> it's a plugin with documentation
[18:27:15] <Guddu> oh ok
[18:29:22] <ColKurtz> Guddu, you just need to call $("form#myID").validate();
[18:29:51] <ColKurtz> and give the inputs class="required"
[18:29:52] <Guddu> ColKurtz, How do i tell that one field of my form shud be numeric? And how d i install this plugin? ia m checking these things
[18:30:08] <ColKurtz> I think class="required number" should make the field required and a number
[18:30:18] <ColKurtz> iirc, never validated for a number
[18:30:23] <Gonad> anyone able to help me with this script:
[18:30:24] <Gonad> http://jsfiddle.net/ufcDP/
[18:30:38] <Gonad> i basically want the two boxes to go up/down when clicked
[18:30:41] <Gonad> it works the first time
[18:30:45] <Gonad> but then it wont go bakc down
[18:30:49] <Gonad> what am I missing?
[18:30:59] <ColKurtz> Guddu, if you need to learn how to 'install' a jquery plugin you should probably do some more reading on jquery basics
[18:31:17] <ColKurtz> jquery docs are probably a good placce to start
[18:31:37] <Guddu> ColKurtz, I kno in the end i just need to include a js file. but i am not sure how to get that js file so i will read. Thanks for your guidance
[18:31:56] <ColKurtz> search google for 'jquery validate,' it will be a top result
[18:32:08] <ColKurtz> and it's hosted on the microsoft AJAX CDN
[18:32:13] <ColKurtz> similar to jquery on google's cdn
[18:32:49] <Guest4768> Is AJAX the sucessor to Java
[18:32:55] <defendguin> i hate the jquery mobile site
[18:32:56] <Guest4768> I mean Java's still 2.0 for crying out loud

[18:46:34] <webguynow> HTML5 input UI support at this link:  http://www.miketaylr.com/code/html5-forms-ui-support.html
[18:47:04] <mythmon> is there anyway I can avoid having this overwritten in callbacks I give to jquery?
[18:47:09] <webguynow> I'm curious about the jQuery at his gist, See the 'Core Tests' link
[18:47:15] <mythmon> or someway to get the old this value? does jquery save it anywhere?
[18:47:20] <webguynow> How does frowny work  ?
[18:48:54] <ajpiano> webguynow: what do you mean, how does it work
[18:48:56] <miketaylr> hey webguynow
[18:49:11] <miketaylr> the theory goes like this:
[18:49:27] <ajpiano> webguynow: it works by the fact that those input types should not allow a string like ":(" and if they worked properly, they wouldn't allow you to set :( as the value
[18:49:35] <miketaylr> according to the html5 spec, inputs have to be sanitized if the value is garbage
[18:49:38] <miketaylr> yeah what ajpiano said
[18:49:39] <Gonad> aaaaaaand I've fixed it
[18:49:42] <Gonad> or rather got it working
[18:49:43] <ajpiano> lol sorry miketaylr i just learned about feature detection and stuff
[18:49:46] <Gonad> in case anyone cares
[18:49:47] <Gonad> http://jsfiddle.net/ufcDP/1/
[18:49:55] <Gonad> is there a more graceful way to do that?
[18:49:56] <miketaylr> lol
[18:49:56] <ajpiano> :D
[18:50:41] <ajpiano> miketaylr: there's no actual explicit test for the ui though, it's just the same test as the input types stuff ya
[18:50:52] <miketaylr> webguynow: so it's just a happy coincidence that all the browsers with real UIs for these html5 inputs implement the sanitization. one day they won't and my tests will be garbage
[18:51:06] <miketaylr> ajpiano: yeah basically
[18:51:22] <miketaylr> html5test tries to compare the computed width of a fancy input vs. a text input
[18:51:29] <miketaylr> but that fails if you zoom in the page
[18:51:50] <miketaylr> wild wild west
[19:00:38] <KevlarSoul> I tried to make an html sheet with this http://jsfiddle.net/KnExN/28/ and it looks nothing like this
[19:05:59] <feathersanddown> is there a way to do a post like submit a form ?? jQuery.post() do an ajax submit, I need a page change (or reload)
[19:07:12] <mythmon> feathersanddown: submit a form.
[19:07:30] <feathersanddown> mythmon: thank you
[19:07:36] <feathersanddown> :)
[19:07:42] <webguynow> thanks miketaylr - I didn't even realize you were in here, but thx
[19:07:58] <miketaylr> heh
[19:08:04] <webguynow> my assumption, was something along those lines - so Kudos for nice code
[19:08:21] <miketaylr> i'm afraid to even look, i wrote that so long ago
[19:11:55] <webguynow> Why do you think, they would (in the future) not implement the santization ?
[19:14:45] <KevlarSoul> Sorry very new here, would this be sufficient to connect js
[19:14:46] <KevlarSoul> <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script>
[19:14:46] <KevlarSoul> <script language="JScript" src="js/jquerytest.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
[19:18:08] <KevlarSoul> http://jsfiddle.net/KnExN/28/
[19:18:30] <KevlarSoul> I made a page with jquerytest.js but it doesnt seem to be grabbing it
[19:19:48] <xp_prg> can I search for rows with a certain colspan?
[19:41:38] <optraz> how do i check if an id is exists?
[19:44:14] <kborchers> optraz: you mean if an element with a certain id exists?
[19:45:04] <optraz> yes
[19:45:10] <kborchers> if($("#yourid").length){ //id exists }else{ //id doesn't exist }
[19:45:32] <optraz> mmm..length..
[19:45:48] <kborchers> yep
[19:46:08] <kborchers> length will be 0 if it doesn't exist which is "falsy"
[19:46:45] <optraz> my issue is that, i have somethign like this, $("#foo").button(); and this line is in a javscript file , now if other html does not have this id, the browser complaint and the whole thing does not work. so that is why i need an if check loop
[19:46:51] <optraz> kborchers: ^^
[19:47:53] <lacinyc> optraz: a solution isn't simply to ensure this javascript doesn't get included with html that never has an object with that id?
[19:48:06] * lacinyc ponder.
[19:48:25] <kborchers> optraz: hmmm, so you mean your JS is being executed before the element exists, i.e. before dom is ready? see ?ready
[19:48:35] <kborchers> lazy bot
[19:48:38] <lacinyc> kborchers: that probably makes more sense :)
[19:48:44] * lacinyc stops trying to help now.
[19:48:59] <kborchers> optraz: look at http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[19:49:26] <optraz> yes, that statement is within the function ready()
[19:50:24] <kborchers> optraz: do you have a working demo i can look at or can you create a reduced test case at jsfiddle.net ?
[19:51:44] <optraz> well, it's fine
[19:51:49] <optraz> i can do it :)
[19:51:50] <optraz> thanks for your help

[19:58:40] <subbyyy> but not in ie
[20:06:40] <Guddu> I have a  Element with Following selector. The element has a value of 0 to start with. Based on the list item selected from a autocomplete widget, i want to increment this value. What is the way to do this? Shall i do something like this or is there a better way $('table#sales_items_total td.right').val($('table#sales_items_total td.right').val + AddedValue)
[20:06:54] <Guddu> Element selector is $('table#sales_items_total td.right')
[20:23:08] <Guddu> Is something like this acceptable for what i need?
[20:23:08] <Guddu> $('table#register').on('change','td#reg_item_qty input#quantity',function(event) {
[20:23:09] <Guddu> 		$('table#sales_items_total td.right').val($('table#sales_items_total td.right').val() + $('td#reg_item_qty input#quantity').val())
[20:23:09] <Guddu>     });
[20:23:25] <mythmon> can I bind functions to jquery events without jquery modifying the "this" of the functions?
[20:32:42] <kaylee> howdy doody
[20:44:59] <rburton-> is there a UI control that has three sliding states. e.g., left, middle (neutral) and right?
[20:46:12] <rburton-> or should I just use a slider and break it down to 3 values or something 0 1 2
[21:00:43] <Ukto> i am using jquery tabs, and have about 3 on the left hand side... is there a way to set the 3rd to basically float right?
[21:01:31] <coldhead> Ukto: didn't you ask this exact question earlier?
[21:01:35] <coldhead> like days ago?
[21:02:59] <coldhead> you did! http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery/%23jquery_20120226.log.html#t00:35:24
[21:03:05] <coldhead> and i answered!
[21:03:06] <coldhead> >: |
[21:03:15] <optraz> when we have this $( "#accordion" ).accordion();
[21:03:26] <optraz> when we have this $( ".accordion" ).accordion();
[21:03:34] <optraz> does it decent to every elemetn having the class accordion?
[21:07:55] <miketaylr> coldhead: WELL IF UR SO SMART.... is there a way to set the 2nd to basically float left?
[21:08:25] <optraz> lol
[21:08:28] <optraz> why so piss?

[21:08:48] <miketaylr> he's good
[21:08:52] <coldhead> i guess that doesn't work though
[21:09:01] <coldhead> OR UKTO WOULD QUIT ASKING
[21:09:10] <miketaylr> this seems relevant: http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery/%23jquery_20120225.log.html#t21:24:04
[21:09:23] <coldhead> maybe it's not basically enough?
[21:09:53] <miketaylr> guys he totally just PMed me and tried to sell me cialis
[21:10:08] <miketaylr> *may or may not have happened. IANAL.
[21:10:22] <miketaylr> i'll see myself out.
[21:10:33] <coldhead> i suppose there IS a correlation between knowing how to basically float the last tab and erectile dysfunction
[21:11:14] <miketaylr> it's like the old proverb
[21:11:28] <miketaylr> you can't spell "left hand siDE" without ED
[21:11:42] <coldhead> woah
[21:11:44] <optraz> lol
[21:11:47] <optraz> chill dude
[21:11:53] <coldhead> i feel like i've been born again again
[21:12:02] <miketaylr> pretty sure that's in the bible
[21:15:22] <kborchers> optraz: yes, $( ".accordion" ).accordion(); will initialize the accordion widget on every element with the accordion class
[21:16:32] <optraz> yes, tried that, it works superb. the jquery ui :)

[21:43:23] <Sensible> The node.js idiots were all using Macs. The “Rails Advocate” from my old job had a Mac. I’m starting to be pretty convinced that if you’re a computer programmer and own a Mac, you’re probably clueless. That should be Apple’s slogan “A computer so easy to use, that even an evil person can use it.”
[21:45:16] <coldhead> your generalisation reminds me of a certain austrian who came to prominence in the 1930s
[21:45:30] <Sensible> Node.js is evil.
[21:46:21] <Sensible> coldhead: At my slave software engineer job, I'm working on a web development project.
[21:46:51] <Sensible> coldhead: My boss decided to rewrite it in node.js. Neither my boss nor anyone else here has ever used node.js before. In other words, a critical business decision was made solely based on hype.
[21:47:07] <Sensible> (Currently, it's written in jsp/Java/Spring/Beans)
[21:47:34] <coldhead> it's not entirely hype. the fact that it's JS on the server and JS in the client is not hype
[21:47:38] <coldhead> that's actually what it is
[21:48:14] <Sensible> Why are we hyping a single-core language in the world of multicore CPUs?
[21:48:42] <Sensible> If I need information on Perl, C#/ASP.NET, php, or Java, there are plenty of online resources. For Node.js, there's practically nothing. If node is so awesome, then why isn't there any documentation?
[21:49:41] <coldhead> because it's so new
[21:49:52] <coldhead> and the devs would rather code than document
[21:50:33] <Sensible> I’m a huge bargain for my market value. I’m at the top end of the ability scale, with productivity 10x or 100x higher than most. Most people would rather have someone clueless that they could push around. Idiots actually select against highly skilled people, because they had bad experiences working with intelligent people in the past, when intelligent people questioned their stupid ideas.
[21:50:49] <coldhead> anyway i agree that making node a critical part of your business stack is reckless but... some kids are having a lot of fun with node
[21:50:55] * Sensible is a Scala programmer.
[21:50:56] <coldhead> and at least it keeps them off teh streets
[21:51:52] <coldhead> cool, scala
[21:52:15] <coldhead> well you should just enjoy your elevated position, don't worry about the node kids
[21:56:15] <Sensible> Horrible job interview today.
[21:56:18] <Sensible> One co-founder had a Harvard MBA, which translates into English as “I’m a retard.”  However, he was intelligent and had the “abused productive” personality type.  Actually, that’s a bad sign.  If the non-technical cofounders have the “abused productive” personality type, then they almost definitely hired parasites and psychopaths to implement the website for them.
[21:58:18] <matadon> Is there some crazy special syntax needed to get fadeIn to run a callback when it completes?

[21:58:38] <Eviltwin> matadon: It takes a callback function...
[22:00:59] <matadon> Eviltwin: As in, thing.fadeIn(delay, callback) — right?
[22:01:03] <Sensible> If you have the intelligent personality type, you hate node.js (if you've tried it). If you have the parasitic personality type, you love node.js.
[22:01:19] <Eviltwin> matadon: http://api.jquery.com/fadeIn/
[22:01:49] <matadon> Eviltwin: Got that, doesn't run the callback.
[22:02:00] <Eviltwin> Does "thing" actually contain any elements?
[22:02:28] <matadon> Eviltwin: I've tried with (delay, easing, callback) and (delay, callback) — no dice. And yes, the element that I want faded in, gets faded in. Just no callback.
[22:02:33] <socialhapy> ★ Tweet from jquerymobile: Just updated the jQuery Mobile homepage with a drag-and-drop UI builder from @codiqa and some cool resources. http://t.co/0lebdSCZ ★ http://bit.ly/Avq09Z
[22:02:53] <matadon> Looked at the jQuery source, and it looks like it *should* run.
[22:03:05] <matadon> Was curious if there was some sort of known problem.
[22:03:06] <Eviltwin> ?demo @ matadon
[22:03:27] <Eviltwin> Ugh
[22:03:30] <Eviltwin> Make a demo at jsfiddle.net
[22:03:40] <Eviltwin> This shouldn't be just pasting your site in the boxes
[22:03:47] <Eviltwin> You should isolate and demonstrate the specific issue
[22:03:52] <Eviltwin> A "working" demo
[22:04:16] <Eviltwin> As in it actually shows the fading but the callback not executing
[22:04:58] <ShawnRisk> if I am using his code: jQuery("body.i18n-fr input[id='edit-community--2']").val("Tapez votre communaut&eacute;..."); to try and translate text from english to french, how do I make this work if &eacute; comes out as &eacute; instead of é?
[22:05:36] <matadon> Eviltwin: Does jsfiddle support alert() dialogues?
[22:05:53] <smplstk> matadon: it's JavaScript
[22:05:57] <smplstk> so...
[22:06:39] <matadon> smplstk: I'm an idiot; point.
[22:07:12] <smplstk> matadon: it's ok :)
[22:07:14] <smplstk> matadon: http://jsfiddle.net/c4Ka7/
[22:07:23] <smplstk> we're all idiots, sometimes.
[22:07:44] <Eviltwin> Well, not all of us
[22:07:59] <matadon> Ok, works in jsfiddle, same code fails in my app. Fun fun.
[22:08:22] <Sensible> jesusabdullah: I love Liftweb.
[22:08:24] <Sensible> In the financial industry, the vast majority of managers are faking it. The CEOs are definitely faking it, and the fakers follow on down the hierarchy. Someone who's faking it will almost never hire someone who really knows what he's doing.
[22:09:22] <smplstk> matadon: might have something to do with the way you've included jQuery?
[22:09:38] <smplstk> do you see any JavaScript errors in the console?
[22:09:51] <matadon> smplstk: Nope, but I've got a hunch.
[22:10:17] <smplstk> matadon: you should really get that checked out by a health professional.
[22:10:34] <matadon> Yep, fixed. Turns out I was calling a proxy method on a related class, that I stupidly named fadeIn.
[22:10:48] <smplstk> matadon: haha
[22:10:52] <smplstk> that'll do it.

[22:13:28] <ShawnRisk> LukeNukem: to me?
[22:13:32] <Sensible> It's one thing for a bunch of "marketing wizards" to start a company. It's another thing to have a working website.
[22:14:33] <smplstk> Sensible: and it's yet another thing to ramble on about... well... nothing.
[22:16:17] <Sensible> For a Microsoft solution, I could easily learn it on my own. I can't learn Rails on my own, because it's totally undocumented.
[22:17:34] <matadon> matadon: It's been a frustrating day. :)
[22:17:45] <matadon> Dah. Now I'm even talking to myself. ;p
[22:19:24] <LukeNukem> yes ShawnRisk

[22:20:53] <ShawnRisk> if I am using his code: jQuery("body.i18n-fr input[id='edit-community--2']").val("Tapez votre communaut&eacute;..."); to try and translate text from english to french, how do I make this work if &eacute; comes out as &eacute; instead of é?
[22:21:31] <smplstk> ShawnRisk: make your life easy and use UTF-8
[22:21:56] <smplstk> ShawnRisk: you shouldn't be translating with JavaScript...
[22:22:24] <ShawnRisk> yes I know
[22:23:42] <ShawnRisk> there is no way to do this in js?
[22:23:57] <smplstk> I'm not even sure what you're trying to do...
[22:24:21] <smplstk> use a patebin like jsfiddle.net to better illustrate, please.
[22:25:18] <LukeNukem> Does anybody know how facebook adds comments instantly in the blink of an eye as soon as the user posts it
[22:25:28] <LukeNukem> its manipulation, im wondering how its done
[22:25:37] <ShawnRisk> translating Type your community… to french in js
[22:26:35] <smplstk> LukeNukem: ajax
[22:26:43] <Cork> LukeNukem: not a facebook user, but prob through longpull/comet
[22:26:54] <LukeNukem> gaah, ajax request posts it into the database
[22:27:03] <LukeNukem> i have done that, but the comment will be visible only on page reload
[22:27:24] <LukeNukem> but on facebook, there is no need of page reload to show the comment..they store the value and just duplicate it or something
[22:27:28] <smplstk> you can have it update via ajax callback
[22:27:32] <LukeNukem> someone showed me this before, i forgot.
[22:27:41] <Cork> LukeNukem: longpull means you open a connection that stays open as long as posible, and the server pushes the update to the client
[22:27:51] <LukeNukem> Cork, i know. That is not what i want though
[22:28:03] <zhuhai> anybody here?
[22:28:03] <Cork> there is no other way
[22:28:07] <LukeNukem> smplstk, yes i do an ajax request for the comments but that makes it weird
[22:28:29] <Cork> LukeNukem: to be able to get updates to the page, you have to have a connection to the server
[22:28:47] <LukeNukem> ik ik
[22:30:38] <zhuhai> who can talk me with the js' object?
[22:31:24] <Cork> ?ask @ zhuhai
[22:31:33] <Cork> oh...
[22:31:38] <Cork> zhuhai: just ask your question
[22:31:41] <LukeNukem> ok who can help me with the interface?
[22:34:01] <zhuhai> can i use the Jquery to create the Object,Cork?
[22:34:10] <Cork> create what object
[22:34:18] <jita> Can anyone look into this? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9471229/scripts-stop-working-after-jquery-replacewith ?
[22:35:52] <Webb34> can anyone give me some quick help?
[22:36:04] <Webb34> im having an issue with this http://people.rit.edu/~ctn9382/536/assignment3/
[22:36:21] <zhuhai> chart cork
[22:36:28] <Cork> jita: you would have to make a more complete example in jsfiddle to get help
[22:36:35] <Webb34> after clicking 'show results' then clicking a hoispital, it creates a tab menu at the top
[22:37:03] <Cork> zhuhai: you don't make any sence... what do you need help with?
[22:37:14] <Webb34> but Im trying to have it so when a specific tab is clicked ('location') some code runs, but Ive had no such luck with .click
[22:38:53] <Cork> Webb34: have you tried the stabselect event?
[22:39:11] <Cork> http://jqueryui.com/demos/tabs/#events
[22:39:13] <Webb34> no what is that
[22:39:40] <Cork> sorry tabselect not stab :)
[22:39:43] <Webb34> i...i love jqueryui
[22:39:56] <Webb34> im gonna give this a shit

[22:43:58] <Roots47> Help: http://pastie.org/3477973   -- This delegate is not firing the first time I mouse over, but is every time thereafter.
[22:45:14] <smplstk> LukeNukem: http://jsfiddle.net/p3Fwu/1/
[22:45:44] <Cork> Roots47: make a demo in jsfiddle
[22:46:18] <LukeNukem> smplstk, thanks a lot :D
[22:46:49] <smplstk> LukeNukem: you'll have to build off that quite a bit, but it's a start...
[22:48:08] <LukeNukem> i have the system ready, ajax and all
[22:48:17] <LukeNukem> just needed to know how to add it instantly without doing an inside ajax request
[22:48:17] <LukeNukem> :D
[22:48:29] <Cork> ...
[22:48:34] <Cork> LukeNukem: you can't
[22:48:38] <Cork> its imposible
[22:48:49] <LukeNukem> i meant, displaying it..
[22:48:50] <LukeNukem> :|
[22:48:57] <Es0teric> impossible they say?
[22:48:59] <Es0teric> NONSENSE
[22:49:11] <Cork> LukeNukem: after you get the data from the server append it to the page
[22:49:22] <Cork> that should be the least problem
[22:52:11] <sx2020> Hey guys, any idea why several of my inputs are unclickable? Like the checkboxes will flash when clicked but won't actually remain checked..
[22:52:52] <Cork> sx2020: you might have a click or change event that resets them
[22:57:47] <sx2020> is there any easy way to detect unclosed tags?
[22:58:18] <Es0teric> sx2020, w3c validator
[23:00:57] <Ukto> i am using jquery tabs, and have about 3 on the left hand side... is there a way to set the 3rd to basically float right? :)
[23:01:22] <sx2020> why not float right?
[23:02:25] <Ukto> i tried
[23:02:30] <Ukto> dont think i put it in the right spot
[23:02:49] * coldhead faps
[23:02:59] <Ukto> i was thinking i might have to make a seperate css set for the floated right tab
[23:03:07] <Ukto> i obviously wont be able to apply it directly to the  <li>
[23:03:30] <SlexAxton> can you post a jsfiddle Ukto ?
[23:03:44] <sx2020> idk, i think an li could float right
[23:03:49] <sx2020> jsfiddle will help
[23:04:16] <coldhead> Ukto: http://irc.jquery.com/%23jquery/%23jquery_20120225.log.html#t21:13:01
[23:04:29] <Eviltwin> Those colors are hard on the eyes
[23:04:45] <SlexAxton> Ukto: are you a bot?
[23:04:49] <coldhead> wear sunglasses, Eviltwin
[23:04:50] <Ukto> no
[23:04:51] <Ukto> :P
[23:05:04] * Ukto is looking up jsfiddle heh
[23:05:24] <sx2020> it's a place to post a minimal example of your problem
[23:05:29] <sx2020> so people can fiddle w it
[23:05:51] <Ukto> yeah, i have used tinkerbin
[23:05:57] <jack> gud noon
[23:06:27] <Ukto> tbh, i dont know that I can rip the code out of the site to stick it into fiddle
[23:06:40] <SlexAxton> it's just css, no?
[23:06:41] <Ukto> i tried to add style="float: right;" to the li
[23:06:45] <SlexAxton> just simplify the problem
[23:06:55] <sx2020> ukto can you link to your site?
[23:06:58] <sx2020> we can fiddle in the console
[23:07:11] <Ukto> lemme add a tab to the main page I guess
[23:07:43] <Ukto> give me a few
[23:08:13] <sx2020> i like to put my float:right elements before the float:left ones
[23:08:47] <Guest64923> http://jsfiddle.net/EdWAF/9/ Here i did tabs concept based on next and previous button.....i have a doubt regarding tab inside of 1 more tabs list based on next button
[23:11:35] <sx2020> here it works w float:right  :: http://jsfiddle.net/EdWAF/12/
[23:12:19] <sx2020> simpler inline CSS example: http://jsfiddle.net/EdWAF/13/
[23:15:57] <Ukto> K
[23:17:54] <Ukto> sx2020: a. i cant seem to view the subtabs on that tab2... but the 3rd is floated right. I put the same on my page, and it doesnt float... want a url to see?
[23:21:17] <Ukto> even firebug says element.style : float: right;
[23:21:19] <Ukto> but it doesnt do it
[23:21:50] <Ukto> and ofc, it shows the default css property for it which is float: left; crossed out
[23:21:52] <Webb34> hey cork you still there?
[23:21:58] <jack123> http://jsfiddle.net/EdWAF/9/ Here i did tabs concept based on next and previous button.......whenever click tab2 that time ill show inside of tab21, tab22, etc.............like that
[23:22:10] <Cork> Webb34: sure
[23:22:17] <Cork> Ukto: do you have a link?
[23:22:21] <Webb34> hey sorry about this but Im new to jquery
[23:22:32] <Cork> Webb34: np
[23:22:33] <Webb34> i found what you were talking about
[23:22:42] <Webb34> but I cant seem to figure out how to use it
[23:23:39] <Cork> Webb34: the element where you run tabs on
[23:23:54] <Webb34> yea
[23:24:01] <Cork> you can bind a tabselect event on it to catch when the tab changes
[23:24:01] <Ukto> Cork: pmd
[23:24:25] <Cork> Webb34: or you can specify select: function in the tabs() call
[23:24:36] <Cork> Ukto: pmd?
[23:24:42] <Ukto> private message'd
[23:24:57] <Ukto> the url that is
[23:27:19] <coldhead> how new Webb34 ?

[23:30:36] <Spokenbird> Hello, a friend sent me here to ask a jQuery question, not really sure what the process is x.x
[23:30:36] <LukeNukem> you see when you hover a div expands
[23:30:41] <LukeNukem> can you help me make it a bit more smoother?
[23:30:44] * coldhead drops the mic
[23:31:51] * LukeNukem catches the mic
[23:37:40] <Webb34> ok so if the div has an id "stuff" if would type $('#stuff').bind( "tabsselect", function(event, ui) {console.log('fatty');});
[23:37:47] <Webb34> ?
[23:41:26] <Xotix> Is it possible to add css to the options of a selectbox?
[23:44:29] <Webb34> hey cork you there?

[23:47:53] <Spokenbird> What is the process here for asking a question?
[23:48:15] <Webb34> i cant figure out jqueryui's tab selector thing
[23:48:46] <Webb34> @spokenbird. I just asked and people seem to be really nice
[23:49:06] <Webb34> so i just threw my question out there
[23:49:23] <gameKing> ??????
[23:50:07] <gameKing> Come on, guys!
[23:52:14] <Webb34> can anybody give me a hand with jquery ui's tab select stuff?
[23:54:21] <sx2020> webb34 whats your issue
[23:55:02] <Webb34> well i have a div containing some stuff that i used jqueryui's tabs to turn into a tab system
[23:55:22] <Webb34> im trying to have some code trigger when a specific tab is selected
[23:55:32] <Webb34> but my code doesnt appear to work
[23:56:13] <sx2020> do you have a link to the problem
[23:56:16] <Webb34> yeah
[23:56:19] <Webb34> here is the site
[23:56:19] <Webb34> http://people.rit.edu/~ctn9382/536/assignment3/
[23:56:31] <Webb34> you have to click 'show results' then click a hospital name
[23:56:45] <Webb34> the tabs should show up at the top
[23:57:01] <sx2020> ok
[23:57:12] <sx2020> they did
[23:57:56] <Webb34> the code that is having an issue is at line 87
[23:58:06] <sx2020> what is not worwking
[23:59:12] <nail_> should be '#dump', not 'dump'
[23:59:14] <Webb34> it should be spitting something into the console log
[23:59:42] <Webb34> yyyup
[23:59:44] <Webb34> that was it
[23:59:49] <Webb34> LOL
