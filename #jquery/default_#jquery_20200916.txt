[11:16:18] <ThoMe> hiho
[11:16:56] <ThoMe> jquery, regex. I have if (field.Zone.match(/^thomas$/i)) {
[11:17:21] <ThoMe> what do I have to do to use a variable instead "thomas". example "name"
[11:31:09] <Turmfalke> That's not a jQuery question, but the answer is match(new RegExp("^" + name + "$"))
[11:42:35] <snackoverflow> can anyone help? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63923560/javascript-html5-canvas-selection-rectangle-drawing-only-one

[15:18:40] <robertmaxrees> save us all a bunch of trouble and just ask questions :shrug:
[17:41:12] <robertparkerx> how could I create a mask with 'kr' at the end of the numbers and the input only accepting numbers
[17:42:46] <robertmaxrees> is kr a reference to some particular money?
[17:43:34] <robertparkerx> robertmaxrees yes
[17:43:46] <robertparkerx> Swedish
[17:45:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd look into input internationalization.
