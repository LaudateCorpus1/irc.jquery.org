[00:02:02] <sydbarret> you will get  [{'city_name': 'lexington'}, {'city_name': 'louisville'}]
[00:02:24] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[00:02:47] <robertmaxrees> you should try to change that to just ['lexington', 'louisville'] if possible.
[00:02:57] <robertmaxrees> but sure - go ahead and spin up a fiddle and we can step through it together :)
[00:03:59] <sydbarret> so you want me to copy to fiddle?
[00:04:08] <robertmaxrees> I want you to get as far as you can on your own.
[00:04:09] <sydbarret> but the html is big
[00:04:13] <robertmaxrees> I'm not going to write code for it.
[00:04:14] <robertmaxrees> *you
[00:04:19] <robertmaxrees> and you jsut need the select element.
[00:04:23] <robertmaxrees> nothing else for starters :)
[00:04:33] <sydbarret> yeah give me 6 min to check that .then()
[00:04:40] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the then right now.
[00:04:48] <robertmaxrees> let's skip the ajax part and focus on just the data.
[00:06:35] <sydbarret> but the data is in correct format thats a json look alike
[00:06:44] <robertmaxrees> lol
[00:06:49] <robertmaxrees> if that's what it'll look like, that's fine.
[00:06:54] <sydbarret> oh wait i need a jsonify function
[00:06:56] <sydbarret> i guess
[00:06:59] <robertmaxrees> no
[00:07:06] <robertmaxrees> that IS JSON.
[00:07:07] <sydbarret> and im reading that i need .done
[00:07:11] <sydbarret> not .then
[00:07:11] <robertmaxrees> you don't need done.
[00:07:18] <robertmaxrees> you want then.  then is the modern replacement for done.
[00:07:43] <sydbarret> ok let me give you my code
[00:08:19] <robertmaxrees> I look forward to your fiddle :)
[00:10:18] <sydbarret> https://pastebin.com/YLp5N1ak
[00:10:27] <robertmaxrees> hrm strange
[00:10:40] <robertmaxrees> oh, you don't want success or error eiuther.
[00:10:43] <robertmaxrees> you want just .then()
[00:10:53] <robertmaxrees> so let's skip all the ajax stuff for the moment.
[00:11:09] <robertmaxrees> head to https://jsfiddle.net/ and pop in an example of the data into the javascript box.
[00:12:10] <sydbarret> https://jsfiddle.net/0pdm4f81/
[00:12:54] <robertmaxrees> awesome!  SO I've added a simple div and jquery to this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/fs9k6yn1/
[00:13:10] <robertmaxrees> now, let's start with the basics - how do you append a <select> to that div
[00:13:11] <robertmaxrees> ?
[00:13:56] <robertmaxrees> (saying "I don't know" is perfectly acceptable here)
[00:14:47] <sydbarret> append? you mean how i rendered my selects?
[00:15:16] <robertmaxrees> back up - start by creating a single select element.
[00:15:23] <robertmaxrees> and then append it do that div.
[00:15:47] <sydbarret> but im using jinja
[00:15:57] <robertmaxrees> we'll worry about populating it with your data later.
[00:16:10] <sydbarret> ok
[00:16:23] <robertmaxrees> also: jinja is for your server-side.  you're doing this client-side.
[00:16:37] <robertmaxrees> so your server-side technology is completely irrelevant for this test case :)
[00:17:24] <sydbarret> https://jsfiddle.net/d9bof05u/
[00:17:46] <robertmaxrees> so will that HTML be there on pageload?
[00:17:46] <sydbarret> you want me to add state as well?
[00:17:55] <robertmaxrees> slow down :)
[00:17:58] <sydbarret> yes
[00:18:15] <robertmaxrees> great!  so now lets transform that array into a bunch of <option> elements :)
[00:18:15] <sydbarret> for the city
[00:18:48] <robertmaxrees> I'd probably use .map() here to get all of those into an array of <option> elements.  i'm going to guess you're not sure how to use that, yeah?
[00:18:52] <sydbarret> are you gonna make the sample complete? we need the other select for the state
[00:19:00] <sydbarret> i can add it
[00:19:04] <robertmaxrees> I'm not going to do anything other than help you learn.
[00:19:13] <robertmaxrees> ignore the state.
[00:19:17] <sydbarret> ok
[00:19:19] <robertmaxrees> we're only talking abnout populating the city dropdown.
[00:20:04] <robertmaxrees> do you understand what I said about using .map()?
[00:20:49] <sydbarret> you said you want an array of elements
[00:21:06] <robertmaxrees> yes.  you will do that by using map on that cities array.
[00:22:29] <sydbarret> var cities = cities.map() ?
[00:22:35] <robertmaxrees> no.
[00:22:43] <robertmaxrees> cities is already defined.
[00:23:05] <robertmaxrees> do you understand how to use .map()?
[00:23:26] <sydbarret> no
[00:24:00] <robertmaxrees> Oh!  We'll let's talk about that then :) so you give it a function and it transforms one array into another formation.
[00:24:03] <robertmaxrees> *format
[00:24:31] <sydbarret> ok
[00:24:43] <robertmaxrees> so check this out: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9xyo7cfg/3/
[00:25:11] <robertmaxrees> cool, right?
[00:25:58] <sydbarret> oh yes basically you are
[00:26:05] <sydbarret> getting rid off the cityname label
[00:26:15] <sydbarret> and grabbing only their values
[00:26:23] <robertmaxrees> sort of - I'm not "getting rid" of anything.
[00:26:35] <robertmaxrees> just getting the city names and putting them into a new array :)
[00:26:52] <sydbarret> yes
[00:27:04] <robertmaxrees> now - those are all strings.  so you can concatenate strings together to get what you want.
[00:27:07] <robertmaxrees> does that make sense?
[00:27:34] <robertmaxrees> so that function could return an option element instead.
[00:31:27] <robertmaxrees> so how might you do that?
[00:32:20] <robertmaxrees> (fyi i gotta leave in a little bit - just a heads up)
[00:33:00] <sydbarret> ().append
[00:33:07] <sydbarret> but this crazy language
[00:33:10] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[00:33:13] <robertmaxrees> we're not there yet.
[00:33:24] <robertmaxrees> you need to get an array of option elements, not an array of city names.
[00:33:36] <robertmaxrees> appending comes later.
[00:33:55] <sydbarret> so you wanna concatenate the array values?
[00:34:01] <robertmaxrees> not yet.
[00:34:09] <robertmaxrees> right now, you have an array of city names.
[00:34:15] <sydbarret> yes
[00:34:16] <robertmaxrees> you instead need an array of <option> elements.
[00:34:35] <robertmaxrees> how would you change that function in map to get you those?
[00:34:57] <sydbarret> looping perhaps
[00:35:01] <robertmaxrees> no.
[00:35:08] <robertmaxrees> you do it as part of the map itself.
[00:35:19] <robertmaxrees> you need to change return city.city_name;
[00:36:23] <sydbarret> but what is an array of option elements
[00:36:36] <sydbarret> i just use jinja to loop
[00:36:37] <sydbarret> it
[00:36:43] <robertmaxrees> again
[00:36:44] <sydbarret> and put it inside the option tag
[00:36:45] <robertmaxrees> jinja is server-side.
[00:36:48] <robertmaxrees> so you cannot use it here.
[00:36:52] <robertmaxrees> you're in the client.
[00:37:11] <sydbarret> so you mean it just need to return name1,name2...?
[00:37:16] <robertmaxrees> dude
[00:37:17] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[00:37:41] <robertmaxrees> cities is the data you're returning from your server.
[00:37:50] <robertmaxrees> you're going to use .map() to turn it into an array of option elements.
[00:37:54] <robertmaxrees> jinja is irrelevant here.
[00:38:05] <sydbarret> yeah i know so what do you want
[00:38:09] <robertmaxrees> you need to change return city.city_name; to return option elements instead.
[00:38:23] <robertmaxrees> how would you change return city.city_name; into an option element?
[00:38:34] <sydbarret> thats just concatenaing the tag as string?
[00:38:46] <robertmaxrees> that's what you want to do, yes.
[00:38:54] <robertmaxrees> it's not doing it yet - you need to change it to do that.
[00:39:51] <sydbarret> so <option>functioname</option>
[00:39:54] <robertmaxrees> no.
[00:39:57] <robertmaxrees> return city.city_name;
[00:39:58] <robertmaxrees> that line
[00:40:03] <robertmaxrees> how would you change that line.
[00:40:08] <robertmaxrees> not the function or anything else.
[00:40:21] <robertmaxrees> just that line inside the function.
[00:41:00] <sydbarret> <option>fcity.cityname</option>
[00:41:09] <sydbarret> concatenating it
[00:41:14] <robertmaxrees> so update the fiddle :)
[00:41:28] <robertmaxrees> show me what you think it is :)
[00:42:07] <sydbarret> https://jsfiddle.net/p5utz436/
[00:42:30] <robertmaxrees> awesome!  it's also a good idea to give them a value= attribute.
[00:42:50] <robertmaxrees> I'll give you that freebie.
[00:43:11] <sydbarret> the value will be a variable?
[00:43:18] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vb5qd0re/1/
[00:43:50] <sydbarret> ok now it needs to append that to the select
[00:43:56] <robertmaxrees> almost!
[00:44:43] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to .join('') it when you append it.
[00:44:49] <robertmaxrees> so what do you think that looks like?
[00:46:22] <sydbarret> functionoutput.join('')
[00:46:31] <robertmaxrees> show me in the fiddle :)
[00:46:56] <robertmaxrees> (even if it doesn't work)
[00:47:28] <sydbarret> https://jsfiddle.net/pm02og4z/
[00:47:39] <robertmaxrees> Nope!
[00:47:44] <sydbarret> needs parenthesis
[00:47:50] <sydbarret> to grab all
[00:47:50] <robertmaxrees> still nope :)
[00:47:59] <robertmaxrees> citiesOptions is what you want to .join()
[00:48:01] <sydbarret> it needs to call the function somewhere
[00:48:40] <sydbarret> https://jsfiddle.net/pm02og4z/1/
[00:48:51] <robertmaxrees> haha almost/.
[00:49:04] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/70oyq4x9/
[00:49:06] <sydbarret> how then you call it that function inside the html
[00:49:17] <robertmaxrees> you don't call it in the html.
[00:49:25] <robertmaxrees> you want to append citiesOptions.join('')
[00:50:18] <sydbarret> https://jsfiddle.net/024vpxny/
[00:50:31] <robertmaxrees> :)
[00:50:43] <robertmaxrees> well done.
[00:50:58] <sydbarret> Its a crapy language innit?
[00:51:03] <robertmaxrees> not really.
[00:51:05] <sydbarret> it doesnt have order
[00:51:08] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[00:51:10] <robertmaxrees> it totally does.
[00:51:12] <sydbarret> is not well structured
[00:51:26] <robertmaxrees> i'm guessing you're more used to python.
[00:51:38] <sydbarret> haha anyway thanks a lot
[00:51:41] <robertmaxrees> you're just not used to the paradigm./
[00:51:51] <robertmaxrees> all about data transforms.
[00:52:07] <sydbarret> yeah its weird
[00:52:14] <robertmaxrees> not really lol
[00:52:24] <robertmaxrees> Just different from what you're used to.
[00:52:34] <sydbarret> what are you not sleeping? you norweigian?
[00:52:40] <sydbarret> why i meant
[00:52:45] <robertmaxrees> I'm in California.
[00:52:50] <robertmaxrees> It's not even 10.
[00:53:06] <sydbarret> oh i see im in bolivia
[00:53:35] <robertmaxrees> cool
[00:53:57] <sydbarret> ok let me work it out and i will tell you tomorrow
[00:54:33] <robertmaxrees> also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/e10wgk36/3/
[00:54:47] <robertmaxrees> for a slightly cleaner version.  there are other tweaks you could make that would improve it even further.
[01:00:55] <robertmaxrees> any other questions?
[01:02:51] <sydbarret> yes
[01:03:25] <robertmaxrees> ?
[01:03:47] <sydbarret> https://pastebin.com/D34pEk8E
[01:04:00] <robertmaxrees> get rid of the success and error.
[01:04:18] <sydbarret> line 10
[01:04:20] <robertmaxrees> also: notice how there you have .then(function(data) { ?  you want .then(function(cities) {
[01:04:26] <sydbarret> should citites should be replaced
[01:04:29] <robertmaxrees> but really, kill the success and error.  you don't need them any more.
[01:04:29] <sydbarret> by data innit?
[01:05:11] <robertmaxrees> see what I said about your .then :)
[01:07:56] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[01:09:43] <sydbarret> yes but i dont know how does it retreive server data inside function
[01:09:56] <sydbarret> does it do it by just matching the var names?
[01:10:12] <sydbarret> so  .then(function(data) {  that data is what i sent
[01:10:14] <sydbarret> or post
[01:10:17] <robertmaxrees> no.
[01:10:21] <sydbarret> but where does it receive the result
[01:10:24] <robertmaxrees> that is the information you're getting back.
[01:10:39] <robertmaxrees> .then(function(thisIsWhatYouAreGettingBackFromTheServer) {
[01:10:40] <sydbarret> oh ok
[01:10:46] <sydbarret> then its fine
[01:10:47] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax() returns a promise.
[01:11:07] <robertmaxrees> .then() is what happens next if it didn't error.
[01:11:23] <sydbarret> so i changed city by data
[01:11:31] <robertmaxrees> why?
[01:11:40] <robertmaxrees> why not do what I suggested and give it a more sensible name?
[01:12:30] <sydbarret> but independent of the name
[01:12:33] <sydbarret> doesnt filter it
[01:12:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:12:44] <robertmaxrees> that name doesn't filter anything.
[01:12:46] <sydbarret> changing city by data should work innit
[01:12:54] <robertmaxrees> i would call it "cities"
[01:12:55] <sydbarret> cities i mean
[01:12:57] <robertmaxrees> since that's what it is.
[01:13:08] <sydbarret> doesnt work let me paste it
[01:13:41] <sydbarret> https://pastebin.com/gynnvx13
[01:13:53] <robertmaxrees> ...
[01:14:43] <robertmaxrees> https://dpaste.org/GXtj
[01:15:01] <robertmaxrees> .then(function(cities) {
[01:15:06] <robertmaxrees> and then var citiesOptions = cities.map(function(city) {
[01:18:15] <sydbarret> is there a way
[01:18:24] <sydbarret> to print the returned value?
[01:18:27] <robertmaxrees> of?
[01:18:34] <sydbarret> of the server
[01:18:46] <robertmaxrees> yeah - that's what cities is.
[01:19:00] <robertmaxrees> console.log(cities); as the first line in that .then() function
[01:19:52] <robertmaxrees> so https://dpaste.org/21yD
[01:22:31] <sydbarret> yeah its printing [{'city_name': 'cedar rapids'}, {'city_name': 'davenport'}, {'city_name': 'des moines'}]
[01:22:38] <robertmaxrees> oh?
[01:22:42] <robertmaxrees> and?
[01:22:47] <sydbarret> but doesnt work
[01:22:56] <sydbarret> still showing the whole cities list
[01:23:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:23:06] <sydbarret> in the dropdown and not only the iowan ones
[01:23:18] <robertmaxrees> oh - that's an issue with your server then.
[01:23:34] <sydbarret> unless you meant to not populate
[01:23:39] <sydbarret> before hand the dropdown
[01:23:47] <sydbarret> because i populated first
[01:23:49] <robertmaxrees> oh, that's because you're appending
[01:23:55] <robertmaxrees> and not emptying the select first.
[01:24:16] <robertmaxrees> try $('#inputCity').html(citiesOptions); instead of the .append
[01:29:11] <sydbarret>  is this an error
[01:29:11] <sydbarret> datatables.min.js:14 jQuery.Deferred exception: cities.map is not a function TypeError: cities.map is not a function
[01:30:04] <Uhkis> it rather clearly states it's an error :P
[01:30:28] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:30:31] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's an error.
[01:30:41] <Uhkis> sounds like cities is not an array
[01:30:41] <robertmaxrees> wtf does datatables have to do with anything???
[01:35:42] <sydbarret> i dont know but still gives this error https://dpaste.org/dE2U
[01:35:53] <sydbarret> i have made the initial rendering empty to use the append
[01:36:10] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[01:36:12] <sydbarret> but its complaining that city.map is not a function?
[01:36:14] <robertmaxrees> why do i even try
[01:36:26] <robertmaxrees> show all your code.
[01:37:05] <sydbarret> https://dpaste.org/vFHP
[01:37:38] <robertmaxrees> sounds liek there's something else on the poage.
[01:38:37] <sydbarret> like what
[01:38:44] <robertmaxrees> no way for me to know.
[01:39:07] <robertmaxrees> are you using datatables?
[01:39:12] <sydbarret> yes
[01:39:43] <robertmaxrees> sooo...
[01:40:25] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:40:44] <sydbarret> but thats on another div
[01:40:47] <sydbarret> im on the script tag
[01:40:54] <robertmaxrees> still the same page though
[01:41:26] <sydbarret> so y ou want me to paste all?
[01:41:37] <robertmaxrees> at least the datatables part sure.
[01:42:56] <sydbarret> https://dpaste.org/3UL2
[01:45:49] <robertmaxrees> i don't see datatables there at all?
[01:46:57] <sydbarret> the layout is calling the datatables cdn
[01:47:11] <robertmaxrees> what about the actual HTML?
[01:47:23] <robertmaxrees> since that's what the jquery is interacting with.
[01:48:06] <sydbarret> its all there
[01:48:11] <robertmaxrees> that's not html.
[01:48:23] <sydbarret>  you can see the HTML select option
[01:48:29] <robertmaxrees> dude
[01:48:33] <sydbarret> this file is called users.html
[01:48:33] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't show the datatables code.
[01:48:40] <robertmaxrees> share the html itself.
[01:48:47] <robertmaxrees> the rendered page.
[01:50:11] <sydbarret> of the layout?
[01:50:16] <robertmaxrees> of the page.
[01:50:17] <robertmaxrees> the html.
[01:50:21] <robertmaxrees> in the browser.
[01:50:37] <sydbarret> how do i do that?
[01:50:45] <sydbarret> right click
[01:50:46] <robertmaxrees> view source in your browser.  copy/paste into a dpase.
[01:50:46] <sydbarret> inspect?
[01:50:52] <sydbarret> ok
[01:57:58] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees https://dpaste.org/q4KP
[01:58:02] <sydbarret> it has sensible data
[01:58:16] <sydbarret> but the table is there where it starts
[01:58:39] <robertmaxrees> dunno then.
[01:59:43] <robertmaxrees> also that cut off after the opening table tag.
[02:01:51] <sydbarret> im reading Objects, {}, in JavaScript does not have the method .map(), it's only for Arrays, [].
[02:02:29] <sydbarret> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30803168/data-map-is-not-a-function
[02:02:30] <robertmaxrees> ....
[02:02:36] <robertmaxrees> so what data are you getting back from your server??
[02:02:58] <sydbarret> the one that I pasted you
[02:03:14] <robertmaxrees> try to JSON.parse() that object then.
[02:03:30] <robertmaxrees> var citiesOptions = JSON.parse(cities).map(function(city) {
[02:05:47] <sydbarret> not i fixed it in the server
[02:05:54] <sydbarret> it needed to be jsonify
[02:06:00] <sydbarret> it works now
[02:06:01] <robertmaxrees> ...
[02:06:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[02:06:13] <sydbarret> but repeat this language is crap
[02:06:19] <robertmaxrees> nah.
[02:06:23] <robertmaxrees> you just have a lot to learn :)
[02:06:26] <sydbarret> what about angujar?
[02:06:29] <sydbarret> angular?
[02:06:33] <robertmaxrees> that's javascript.
[02:06:36] <sydbarret> isnt that the new stuff?
[02:06:43] <robertmaxrees> it's still javascript lol
[02:06:49] <robertmaxrees> not gonna change any of your issues.
[02:06:58] <sydbarret> haha
[02:08:32] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[02:08:47] <sydbarret> you still in quarentine there?
[02:08:50] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[02:09:02] <robertmaxrees> have been since march 13th
[02:09:10] <sydbarret> but is it strict?
[02:09:23] <sydbarret> because here i can only go out on mondays in the morning
[02:09:28] <robertmaxrees> not that strict.
[02:09:38] <robertmaxrees> we have to wear masks if we go out and minimize how often we leave.
[02:10:25] <sydbarret> lets hope bill gates find the vaccine by the end of the month
[02:10:31] <robertmaxrees> he won't lol.
[02:10:44] <robertmaxrees> won't be until late 2020/early 20201
[02:10:46] <robertmaxrees> *2021
[02:12:17] <sydbarret> i have to sleep take care
[02:12:21] <robertmaxrees> kbye
[07:47:22] <AntoineDTD> Hello guys. I have to test a page working with "bootstrap", there is a a href button that switch block with an animation. How can i know if this is using jquery ? And how can i know which script it is using ?
[07:48:36] <Cork> AntoineDTD: simplest is normally to catch the event in the developer tools in the browser
[07:48:46] <Cork> then it will just tell you where the event handler is
[07:49:11] <AntoineDTD> Cork => how do i catch event ? let me have a look on google to see if i can find a tuto
[07:49:15] <AntoineDTD> thank you very much
[07:49:45] <AntoineDTD> ok i got it
[07:49:48] <Cork> AntoineDTD: you don't catch it, you can say break when an event is fired for the element
[07:49:49] <AntoineDTD> thank you very much
[07:50:00] <Cork> or you can click a ref for all events bound to a specific element
[07:50:09] <Cork> what you can do depends on your browser
[07:51:00] <AntoineDTD> got it ! thank you very much my friend :)
[07:51:03] <AntoineDTD> you saved me
[07:52:52] <AntoineDTD> Cork maybe one more question please :) is there a way to verifiy all input files are filled in one shot instead of verifying them one by one ?
[07:53:19] <Cork> "input files"
[07:53:26] <AntoineDTD> fields*
[07:53:26] <Cork> not even sure what you mean by that
[07:53:28] <Cork> ah
[07:53:29] <AntoineDTD> ^^
[07:53:47] <Cork> depends on what solution you want
[07:54:06] <Cork> you can use the html validation (required and so on) if that is enough for you
[07:54:08] <AntoineDTD> in fact i just wanna addClass with red border on all fields that is empty
[07:54:15] <Cork> or you can try the jquery.validate plugin
[07:54:31] <altrgeek> Hello everyone!I'm new to jQuery. I'm trying to get a basic function to work. There's a Input text field with character input limitation, which is working fine. Now I want to add a text under the input field which will display remaining characters as user type. I've added a html code under the input field which is "<span>15</span> characters
[07:54:31] <altrgeek> remaining"Now I want to create a function that will dynamically display the remaining characters.The code I'm using to limit characters  https://hastebin.com/kicitezipu.js
[07:55:05] <AntoineDTD> in fact it's a form in a two steps way. You have a first button that is not a button but a href when you click on it you go the next block with others fields. I have to stop the event check fields and if they are all filled i can allow the event again
[07:55:09] <Cork> AntoineDTD: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation or https://jqueryvalidation.org/
[07:55:26] <AntoineDTD> so there is no form submit with the first button (href=
[07:55:30] <AntoineDTD> (href)
[07:55:55] <Cork> by href you mean an a link tag?
[07:57:02] <AntoineDTD> yes. You ahve a global form with one block (like a page) containing fields name, email etc... so you have to clic on next to go to the second block with visa number etc so the first button is not a button but a link a href that use jquery to animate the fadein fadeout of the blocks
[07:57:08] <AntoineDTD> i know now how to stop the event :)
[07:57:25] <AntoineDTD> and i now have to verify all fields in the first block with no submit
[07:57:41] <Cork> well you just have to trigger the validation of the fields you care about on the click (though i would use a button not a link for actions)
[07:57:42] <AntoineDTD> i can do a input[name=...].val() != '' for each one but it's dirty
[07:58:09] <AntoineDTD> i agree i don t understand why they use a link instead of button...
[07:58:27] <AntoineDTD> but they pay me to just validate fields not to remake the hole page ^^
[07:58:49] <AntoineDTD> so maybe i could use a .each on all input fields in the first block
[07:59:00] <AntoineDTD> with a if this.val() empty add class
[07:59:09] <AntoineDTD> else removeclass
[07:59:13] <Cork> ya, well i have already answered your question
[07:59:18] <Cork> check the links
[07:59:24] <AntoineDTD> yes i will thanks again
[08:03:25] <IHasFingers> hi guys, I am using .append to add some html elements to an div. The elemnt I am added has some classes which I have a .click event to it. However when this element has been append when i click on them, the event does not get trigger. IF I add the element to the html directly. refresh the page and click on it. The event works. Why can´t isnt the click event working when the element has been append?
[08:04:49] <Cork> IHasFingers: $('').on('event', function() {}) does: $() makes a search and create a set of matched elements; .on() loops the set and binds an event handler to each element in the set
[08:05:04] <Cork> IHasFingers: so if the element isn't there when the selector runs it isn't included
[08:05:18] <Cork> IHasFingers: the solution to this is to bind a handler to a static parent
[08:05:58] <Cork> IHasFingers: https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[08:06:21] <IHasFingers> Cork, in my case is a table and i am added a td with a button via append
[08:06:36] <Cork> read what i wrote
[08:06:37] <IHasFingers> am guessing i need to add the click on the table class
[08:06:40] <Cork> no
[08:06:57] <Cork> firstly you don't add events to a class you add events to elements
[08:07:15] <Cork> and you should add your event handlers statically to the table or tbody
[08:07:22] <Cork> instead of one time for each row
[08:07:33] <Cork> or even one time for each button
[08:07:38] <Cork> (forst case)
[08:07:42] <Cork> worst*
[08:08:08] <IHasFingers> I get what you mean
[08:08:15] <IHasFingers> will give that a go. thanks
[08:13:12] <IHasFingers> Cork, something like  $(".tbody").on('click',function () { });
[08:13:23] <Cork> no
[08:13:26] <Cork> read the link
[08:25:08] <IHasFingers> Cork, thanks again :)
[08:25:16] <Cork> np
[09:40:54] <AntoineDTD> Cork > you there ?
[09:42:04] <AntoineDTD> oh it's ok i got it
[09:42:06] <AntoineDTD> ^^
[09:54:41] <AntoineDTD> Ok i don't get it ^^ Cork => i am working on validate.js as you told me... but what is the attribute in the rules parameter to set the lenght of the field please ? i can see minlength and maxlength but no exact length. Shall i use maxlength && minlenght to set the exact length i want ? and if yes if i need a 3 digit length shall i set minlength 3 && maxlength 3 ?
[09:54:48] <AntoineDTD> can't find answer in the documentation
[11:04:02] <ahiru> hello there
[11:04:25] <ahiru> https://codepen.io/felipemotand/pen/mdVwJzw?editors=1010
[11:04:41] <ahiru> I'm not knowing how to loop this code correctly
[11:05:28] <ahiru> what I want it to do it to move the element .creditos-banner outside .content
[11:06:56] <ahiru> but it's duplicating the element to the amount of the total existing one, to every single case
[11:08:57] <Phruis> hello
[11:09:27] <Phruis> i have a situation where i want to disable a button on click, but then finish the form submission
[11:09:36] <Phruis> its a normal form submission not a ajax submission
[11:09:39] <Phruis> how do i do that?
[11:09:46] <Phruis> just wanna make sure it isn't submitted twice
[11:19:22] <ahiru> Phruis: https://codepen.io/felipemotand/pen/jOWwbBj?editors=1010
[11:20:48] <Phruis> ahiru thanks
[11:30:52] <Phruis> doesn't appear to work
[11:30:59] <Phruis> it is stopping the submission
[11:46:44] <ahiru> can you provide your code on codepen or similar?
[11:47:02] <Phruis> its just a <form> submission
[11:47:08] <Phruis> no js right now on it
[11:47:12] <Phruis> in a modal though
[11:47:16] <Phruis> a bootstrap modal
[12:21:16] <ahiru> if there's no code submitting the form, there's nothing to stop the submission
[12:21:21] <ahiru> right?
[12:22:02] <Phruis> ahiru it only happens on chrome
[12:22:14] <Phruis> the only js code is what you gave me i think
[12:26:04] <ahiru> my codepen link is working on chrome and firefox
[12:33:49] <shoky_> ahiru: i didnt understand your issue - it's moving each .creditos-banner outside its parent .content. there's no duplication happening
[12:34:43] <Phruis> ahiru yeah but you aren't actually submitting a form
[12:36:46] <ahiru> shoky_: I just happened to fix it!
[12:37:15] <ahiru> I found a genial way  to use .find() to do the loop
[12:37:34] <ahiru> I didn't know I could use it with a $(this) inside a loop
[12:37:59] <shoky_> k
[12:38:18] <ahiru> Phruis: you asked to just make it get disabled, right?
[12:38:34] <ahiru> I thought you already had the submission code
[14:24:34] <Phruis> ahiru it is submitting with the normal <form> tag
[14:24:36] <Phruis> not jquery
[14:24:47] <Phruis> but disabling the button in Chrome stops the form submission
[14:24:53] <Phruis> it works in firefox
[14:26:13] <robertmaxrees> why not have your server detect if it's a double submission and reject the second one?
[14:26:52] <Phruis> robertmaxrees i am not familiar with that technique
[14:27:19] <Phruis> check to see if the data has changed and just ignore it if it hasn't?
[14:27:29] <robertmaxrees> :) the same client submitting the same form twice within a few seconds is a good indicator that they tried to submit twice.
[14:27:48] <Phruis> yeah sounds good but how would you implement that?
[14:27:50] <robertmaxrees> what's your server-side language?
[14:27:57] <Phruis> php
[14:28:09] <Phruis> using CI3
[14:29:11] <robertmaxrees> https://arjunphp.com/prevent-multiple-form-submissions-php/
[14:29:17] <robertmaxrees> lots of options out there.
[14:29:31] <Phruis> never heard of that
[14:29:33] <Phruis> cool
[14:29:34] <Phruis> thanks
[14:29:46] <robertmaxrees> I'd search terms like 'prevent multiple form submissions php' or 'prevent multiple form submissions codeigniter' (without quotes ofc)
[14:30:00] <Phruis> ahh yeah
[14:30:11] <robertmaxrees> this'll work much better since you aren't relying on the client-side to handle it.  if the js then happens to break, no big!
[14:30:24] <Phruis> right
[14:51:24] <Joel> does anyone have an example of handling a paginated ajax response?
[14:51:46] <robertmaxrees> Joel pretty basic concept - where are you getting stuck
[14:51:46] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:55:14] <Joel> robertmaxrees not suck, just seeing what the pattern is, I'll probably write a wrapper function, which takes a page param, and keep calling it in a loop as long as there's more results.
[14:55:37] <robertmaxrees> so you're just trying to donload everything all at once?
[14:55:57] <robertmaxrees> That's... odd.  Why not just update your server to give you that option instead?
[15:04:57] <Joel> robertmaxrees not my server
[15:08:06] <robertmaxrees> Oh.  Working with an API then?
[15:08:53] <robertmaxrees> Might be careful with that since there's usually a really good reason people implement pagination :)
[15:20:12] <Joel> Yup, and I'm aware, I have a delay and an exponential back off.
[15:46:36] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees the dropdown boxes only work for 1 row so I have added unique ids to the states and cities but how do I transpose that to the jquery
[15:47:10] <robertmaxrees> sydbarret 2 things: 1. ask the channel, not me directly ;) 2. not really clear on your questiom.  try again.
[15:48:05] <sydbarret> so what we did works only for 1 row i have a table where i have placed those 2 dropboxes in a table row and column
[15:48:25] <sydbarret> so i think i need to add id to them
[15:48:29] <robertmaxrees> let me rephrase - I have hardly any recollection of what i ate for breakfast, and I eat the same thing each day.
[15:48:37] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're trying to do and be more specific :)
[15:48:51] <sydbarret> so in this line $("#inputState").change(function () {
[15:48:58] <robertmaxrees> fiddle pls :)
[15:48:59] <sydbarret> how I reference the id
[15:49:03] <robertmaxrees> i really don't remember your code.
[15:49:18] <robertmaxrees> i also have a full time job doing other stuff, so i'm not going to hold another person's project in my head lol.
[15:50:02] <sydbarret> https://dpaste.org/3UL2
[15:50:15] <robertmaxrees> that's not html :)
[15:50:18] <robertmaxrees> show the html.
[15:51:51] <sydbarret> you know jinja right?
[15:51:56] <robertmaxrees> again
[15:51:56] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:52:10] <robertmaxrees> isolated test case broski :)
[15:52:29] <sydbarret> so i have many of these
[15:52:46] <robertmaxrees> great! share one that demopnstrates the problem you're trying to solve.
[15:53:09] <sydbarret> <select class="stateselection" id="inputState617" name="states">
[15:53:14] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[15:53:16] <robertmaxrees> that's not a fiddle.
[15:53:19] <sydbarret> i have many of these in each row
[15:53:31] <sydbarret> question is how do i reference it that id on j query
[15:53:33] <robertmaxrees> huh.  hard to pictures.
[15:53:44] <robertmaxrees> *picture.  can you show me an example of what you've got?
[15:54:08] <sydbarret> you want me to show screenshot?
[15:54:12] <robertmaxrees> i want a jsfiddle.
[15:54:19] <robertmaxrees> with example markup.
[15:54:27] <robertmaxrees> so i can see and interact with the actual relevant code :)
[15:55:01] <sydbarret> https://jsfiddle.net/024vpxny/
[15:55:06] <sydbarret> thats what we did
[15:55:11] <robertmaxrees> weird.
[15:55:18] <robertmaxrees> you just said there are multiple selects involved now?
[15:55:22] <robertmaxrees> can you show me what that looks like?
[15:55:26] <robertmaxrees> in the fiddle.
[16:22:32] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/uvk65Ljd/1/
[16:23:59] <robertmaxrees> oh... why not an isolated test case?
[16:24:52] <sydbarret> check row 617
[16:25:10] <sydbarret> and 621
[16:26:25] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/xCVzYLE.png
[16:26:36] <robertmaxrees> let's get an isolated test case of just the relevant bits instead.
[16:26:46] <robertmaxrees> thousands of lines of html isn't really useful in cases like this :)
[16:34:32] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/uvk65Ljd/2/
[16:35:13] <robertmaxrees> ok.
[16:35:20] <robertmaxrees> so what's the issue?
[16:36:35] <sydbarret> issue is that its only filtering for 617 and not for 621
[16:36:44] <robertmaxrees> "filtering"?
[16:37:21] <robertmaxrees> mind starting from the beginning? "when I do x, I expect y to happen.  instead, z is happening."
[16:38:36] <sydbarret> check your code
[16:38:42] <sydbarret> you made it work for only 1 row
[16:38:46] <robertmaxrees> lmfao
[16:38:52] <robertmaxrees> first off - i helped YOU write it.
[16:39:07] <robertmaxrees> so it's YOUR code :) second - that doesn't answer my questions :)
[16:39:10] <robertmaxrees> *question
[16:39:26] <sydbarret> is this the solution ? https://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/traversing/
[16:39:41] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea because i don't understand the question.
[16:39:46] <sydbarret> i know why it doestn work
[16:39:53] <robertmaxrees> so then what's the problem statement?
[16:39:54] <sydbarret> but i cant put it in jquery
[16:40:16] <sydbarret> the one i told
[16:40:17] <sydbarret> you
[16:40:23] <robertmaxrees> where? :)
[16:40:25] <sydbarret> why doesnt work for 621
[16:40:36] <robertmaxrees> what *what* doesn't work?
[16:40:43] <sydbarret> you cant see it on the html because it has to pull from db
[16:40:47] <sydbarret> through ajax
[16:40:59] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand why you're being vague and obstuse.
[16:41:01] <robertmaxrees> sorry :shrug:
[16:41:20] <sydbarret> hahqa
[16:41:28] <sydbarret> you deserve to be shot
[16:41:28] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:41:37] <robertmaxrees> woah - hey, not cool.
[16:41:38] <robertmaxrees> 100%.
[16:41:56] <sydbarret> i though by changing
[16:42:00] <sydbarret> to a class would work
[16:42:02] <sydbarret> but doesnt
[16:42:19] <sydbarret> from (#inputState) to (.stateSelection)
[16:42:21] <robertmaxrees> try the problem statement format I gave earlier.
[16:42:33] <robertmaxrees> "when i do x, i expect y to happen.  instead, i get z."
[16:42:48] <sydbarret> just review your code
[16:42:53] <sydbarret> and escalate it
[16:42:59] <robertmaxrees> it's not my code.
[16:43:01] <sydbarret> to work with all the individual rows
[16:43:02] <robertmaxrees> "escalate" what?
[16:43:06] <robertmaxrees> aaaaahhhh
[16:43:39] <robertmaxrees> let me guess - when you interact with a state dropdown, you expect it to modify the city dropdown in the same row.  instead, it's only modifying the first city dropdown each time?
[16:44:15] <sydbarret> yes
[16:44:24] <robertmaxrees> weird - why didn't you just say that? :)
[16:44:43] <robertmaxrees> so yeah, just changing to a class won't work.  you'll first need to modify your code to not use that ID any more.
[16:45:46] <robertmaxrees> change that ID to a class instead.  then you'll need to traverse from the state select that was changed over to the .inputCity in that same row.
[16:46:14] <sydbarret> the id  of the city that is right?
[16:46:22] <robertmaxrees> don't use IDs for this.
[16:46:24] <sydbarret> because the state is already with a class in jquery
[16:46:26] <robertmaxrees> you can use classes.
[16:47:44] <robertmaxrees> i'd probably start with $(this), then use .closest() to go up to the .form-row ancestor, then .find the .inputCity
[16:48:02] <robertmaxrees> get id of all id="inputCity" attributes since it's invalid to repeat an id on a page.
[16:51:01] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[16:52:59] <AntoineDTD> Hey guys ! I have an Ajax post with data as a form.serialize my problem i gettin a token when form is submit but in the serialize post i don't see it
[16:53:19] <robertmaxrees> AntoineDTD can you show us the form and relevant js?
[16:53:25] <AntoineDTD> yop sir :)
[16:53:31] <robertmaxrees> killer
[16:58:29] <AntoineDTD> https://pastebin.com/TuJsMz4F
[16:58:55] <AntoineDTD> i ve cut in the html code cuz it's about 250 lines
[16:58:56] <AntoineDTD> :)
[16:59:49] <AntoineDTD> i don t understand why i can't get the token. It's loaded before the ajax call and i have verified it's in the form
[16:59:50] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[16:59:52] <robertmaxrees> sec - meeitng.
[17:00:45] <robertmaxrees> but also: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/80tpj47w/ - missing some js.  also mind validating the form?  id does it actually have that stripeToken input on pageload?
[17:01:53] <AntoineDTD> oh sorry i didn t thought you d use fiddl
[17:02:00] <AntoineDTD> i cut in the code ^^
[17:02:33] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[17:02:36] <robertmaxrees> "cut in"?
[17:02:50] <AntoineDTD> i did not put all the code cuz it's too big
[17:02:57] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[17:03:03] <AntoineDTD> what means hrm ?
[17:03:11] <robertmaxrees> so is that stripeToken input there on pageload?
[17:03:33] <AntoineDTD> not token input field is loaded after the form submit
[17:03:58] <AntoineDTD> generation of the token is made line 53 in the pastie
[17:04:05] <robertmaxrees> oh... mind showing that code?
[17:04:45] <robertmaxrees> brb
[17:04:47] <AntoineDTD> oh wait i think i got it !
[17:05:11] <AntoineDTD> ok i am stupid...
[17:05:21] <AntoineDTD> i generate the serialize before the token... my fault :(
[17:06:52] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:11:46] <AntoineDTD> ^^
[17:11:52] <AntoineDTD> thank you rob
[18:13:10] <sydbarret> robertmaxrees so here y variable should be the city dropdown? but it doesnt work. Am i in the correct place?  https://jsfiddle.net/uvk65Ljd/3/
[18:13:19] <robertmaxrees> please ask the channel ;)
[18:14:08] <sydbarret> we were talking just 30 min ago not a week ago
[18:14:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:14:29] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[18:17:13] <sydbarret> i will take a cup of coffee and when I get back i want those 3 lines of code solved
[18:17:35] <robertmaxrees> that's enough of that behavior.
[18:59:25] <Waldkauz> Half an hour later and still no one posted a solution >:(
[18:59:50] <robertmaxrees> ?
[19:00:13] <Waldkauz> "sydbarret>  i will take a cup of coffee and when I get back i want those 3 lines of code solved"
[19:01:21] <robertmaxrees> oh, heh
[19:01:26] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  aaaaanyway
[19:33:33] <Joel> I've got an html element, which is a row in a table, any way for me, from this element, to easily find my siblings in the table? 1,2,3. If I'm 2 I want to find 1 and 3. If I'm 1 I want to find 2.
[19:33:47] <robertmaxrees> can you share example html?
[19:34:00] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, give them semantic classes and then select using those :)
[19:39:23] <Joel> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/#&togetherjs=McjDsyGsbP
[19:39:38] <Joel> robertmaxrees lines 98/99 are what I'm playing with
[19:40:07] <robertmaxrees> togetherjs is sooo slowwww
[19:41:00] <robertmaxrees> (hit "save" and share the page link out instead)
[19:41:39] <robertmaxrees> Joel ^ :)
[19:42:47] <robertmaxrees> oh it finally loaded.  So first off - let's fix how you're using jsfiddle :)
[19:43:13] <Joel> Yes, I'm aware I'm not using it right.
[19:43:23] <Joel> and yes, I already rolled my exposed credential *Facepalm*
[19:44:03] <robertmaxrees> sou you're trying to find a <tr> by index?
[19:44:29] <Joel> When I'm done dropping a row, I want to find the row above and below me, so I can call an API, which needs to know the ID of those rows
[19:44:46] <Joel> parent should work, just using it wrong I believe
[19:45:08] <robertmaxrees> so .parent() grabs ancestors, not siblings.
[19:45:21] <robertmaxrees> also: as a warning, mixing jquery ui and bootstrap is a recipe for headaches.
[19:46:28] <Joel> I expected parent to grab the tbody, but it's grabbing the thead
[19:46:29] <robertmaxrees> so where are these draggable TRs?
[19:47:42] <Joel> throw jjshoe/test1 gitlab project
[19:47:48] <Joel> click fetch issues
[19:48:00] <robertmaxrees> even better, i just faked it
[19:48:03] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[19:48:08] <Joel> also, delete the gitlab access token
[19:48:37] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dytL4b97/5/ this is all you need here :)
[19:49:30] <robertmaxrees> so what are you sending the API on drop?
[19:49:42] <Joel> new position
[19:49:50] <Joel> drag and drop ordering
[19:49:52] <robertmaxrees> did you design this API or is it hosted by someone else?
[19:50:22] <Joel> gitlab does this, in one view, but it's paginated, and you can't drag across pages. They do it in another view, but it's god awfully small, and can't be expanded without browser hacks. I decided f it, here we go.
[19:51:00] <robertmaxrees> gotcha.
[19:51:05] <robertmaxrees> either way, if you want the index: https://api.jquery.com/index/
[19:51:06] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:51:16] <Joel> Thanks, reading up now.
[19:51:32] <Joel> Another approach could be a browser extension to make that page more useable. Might have been a better way for me to go.
[19:51:59] <Joel> as it's mostly just CSS at that point, hrump, back to the thinking throne
[19:54:37] <Joel> robertmaxrees actually, yours gets the same error as mine when I tried that
[19:54:44] <robertmaxrees> what error?
[19:55:24] <Joel> ui.item[0].parent is not a function
[19:55:38] <robertmaxrees> because you're accessing the dom node for ui.item./
[19:55:48] <robertmaxrees> which isn't what you want :)
[19:55:54] <Joel> Right, I want the jquery version of it?
[19:56:13] <Joel> as simple as $(ui.item[0]) ?
[19:56:23] <robertmaxrees> why are you using [0]??
[19:57:04] <robertmaxrees> ui.item is already a jquery object :)\
[19:57:06] <Joel> You have it in your fiddle, I didn't think it was right
[19:57:18] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[19:57:37] <Joel> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dytL4b97/5/
[19:57:48] <robertmaxrees> oh, that fiddle i posted what just a simplification of the test case down to the bare minimum.
[19:57:51] <robertmaxrees> i didn't change anything else.
[19:58:25] <Joel> gotchya. I'll go read on index and play
[20:00:29] <robertmaxrees> fwiw: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/dytL4b97/
[20:00:30] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[20:06:05] <Joel> robertmaxrees I worked it out, thanks for the patience
[20:06:08] <robertmaxrees> :)
[20:06:12] <robertmaxrees> def!
[20:06:21] <robertmaxrees> thanks for being appreciative :D
[20:06:57] <Joel> Yeah, so I use the index, then peak back into $('#issues-tbody').children().get(index -/+1 ); to get my surrounding siblings
[20:07:07] <Joel> I of course am doing bounds checking
[20:07:58] <Joel> Final step is the ajax call to update the position! I also could stand to add a lot of error checking here and there, and validation, but for a PoC this is looking good.
[20:08:13] <Joel> I never thought I'd say this in my life, but using gitlab issues makes me miss jira :~(
[20:09:11] <robertmaxrees> hjahahaha
[20:09:17] <Joel> I think github is probably the worst, as it doesn't support re-ordering of issues at all, I don't know how PM's order backlogs, maybe integrate with another tool
[20:09:32] <Joel> I'm only trying to order my own damn work, I'm not even a PM :\
[20:09:54] <robertmaxrees> Heh, most PMs aren't using gitlab/github issues for projects.
