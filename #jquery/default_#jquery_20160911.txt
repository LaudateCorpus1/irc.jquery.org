[10:26:38] <hamdjan> hi, is this correct to detect clicks? $(".favs-post").click(function (event) {  event.preventDefault(); // some other stuff}
[10:26:47] <Woet> i dont know, does it work?
[10:27:06] <hamdjan> it doesnt work
[10:27:19] <Woet> then how can it be correct?
[10:27:38] <Woet> unless something else is incorrect that you haven't shown us
[10:28:19] <hamdjan> ye, maybe something in html may cause this
[10:28:29] <Woet> maybe
[10:28:34] <hamdjan> html is: <a class="favs-post" title="add">...</a>
[10:28:45] <Woet> turn it into a working demo on www.jsfiddle.net please
[10:28:54] <hamdjan> ok
[10:43:13] <hamdjan> it works on jsfiddle https://jsfiddle.net/onL67p5o/8/

[17:33:49] <braindead_> hey friends.. i hope you guys can help me out.
[17:34:12] <RottenCore> sup
[17:34:25] <braindead_> i got one of this cookie notification bars with two buttons. 1st to show more and 2nd to close/hide the bar (accept)
[17:34:45] <braindead_> its working to show the more info but the other button has no function
[17:34:50] <braindead_> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/9cbcd3f8033d80a681e1c94ed52dc4b2 this is the code i guess
[17:35:33] <braindead_> to me it looks like there is the else function missing or something
[17:36:26] <taplar> why would you make an ajax request if your going to close the bar?
[17:36:49] <braindead_> i dont know any of this stuff
[17:37:15] <braindead_> so i am just doing things that appears logical to me and mess up code
[17:37:26] <braindead_> but i dont know any language or anything
[17:38:07] <taplar> well i don't know your system or the logic, but it would seem to me that that logic should be bound to the show more button, and all the hide button should do is do that.
[17:38:32] <braindead_> yeahr right taplar
[17:38:42] <braindead_> so this is the wrong piece of code to do that?
[17:38:54] <taplar> afaict, yeah
[17:40:03] <braindead_> ok.. just saw the value==1 and the +/link and thought the other button (or value) could be there too
[17:40:22] <taplar> it may be bound to both of them and that is filtering
[17:40:29] <taplar> but that should probably change if so
[17:41:44] <braindead_> is there not an option like if(e.target.value==2) close?
[17:42:13] <taplar> you can, but like i said, that's inside an ajax request.  no reason to make a request if your going to close whatever
[17:42:23] <taplar> unless there is a reason
[17:42:59] <braindead_> if i link you the live example it wouldnt help, right?
[17:43:32] <taplar> not really.  it would be more helpful if there was someone in shop that could give you more insight as to what should be happening
[17:45:21] <braindead_> i know what should happen, i just dont know how to do so :) .. but nevermind .. its just a little weak that you need to click the more button to make that message disapear
[17:45:34] <braindead_> +p
[18:22:35] <NomadJim> how do I retrieve the max variable of a progressbar?

[20:35:17] <nickray> hey all freenode noob here.  I have a problem with jquery that I haven't been able to solve.  I'm trying to close a jquery-ui dialog from an event handler outside of the dialog's definition.
[20:35:26] <nickray> \
[20:35:54] <nickray> the close works only when i pause just before it with the debugger
[20:36:17] <nickray> but it doesn't get called during normal execution
[20:36:28] <nickray> any ideas?

[23:44:16] <Nicu> hello, I don't know why counting all the elements with a certain class only returns the first result
[23:44:31] <Nicu> page: https://www.starrepublik.com/newspaper/article/1884/
[23:44:51] <Nicu> code: $('.commentator')
[23:45:07] <Nicu> adding .length returns "undefined"
[23:45:54] <Nicu> and this happens in Chromium 52
[23:46:30] <Nicu> interesting... it works as expected in Firefox
[23:50:10] <Nicu> it works in Chrome 48 as well
