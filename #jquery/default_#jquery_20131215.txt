[00:39:46] <d1rkp1tt> Hi all,  just trying to create a new app in my project folder with manage.py startapp and I am getting a warning  __init__.py already exists
[00:40:02] <d1rkp1tt> Disregard...  wrong channel :\
[01:00:39] <obert> hello, if i use .append to create a html element in a page, how could i modify the url in order to show the internal anchor in the browser tab?
[01:01:40] <Cork> obert: are you talking about example.com/url/#<id> or the full url?
[01:01:57] <pixelpimp> window.location.hash, likely
[01:02:17] <obert> Cork: yep, atm my code doesnt modify the url, so the internal anchor wont works
[01:02:28] <Cork> obert: ok?
[01:02:36] <Cork> that's not an answer?
[01:02:36] <obert> mhmh how pixelpimp?:p
[01:02:47] <pixelpimp> By researching what that does.
[01:02:53] <Cork> obert: are you talking about example.com/url/#<id> or the full url? <--
[01:03:01] <obert> uhmf you lazy ass
[01:03:09] <pixelpimp> Really?
[01:03:10] <Cork> ...
[01:03:24] <obert> you!
[01:03:28] <Cork> obert: he gave you the command what is lacy about that...
[01:03:30] <obert> Cork: yes
[01:03:45] <Cork> obert: do you even bother to read the question?
[01:03:55] <pixelpimp> obert: if you wish to be rude, you can leave and go somewhere else.  No need for us to assist you.
[01:04:25] <obert> pixelpimp: come on, i am just awaking
[01:04:46] <pixelpimp> I don't see how this affects me.
[01:05:33] <obert> Cork: i try again: the url atm is not changing from http://myurl and i am trying to create http://myurl#foo, then yes, i will try to understand how to implement window.location.hash in my function
[01:05:50] <obert> and thanks for now
[01:16:11] <symtab> hi
[01:16:18] <symtab> http://www.scriptdevel.com/admin/index.php/core/config/
[01:16:27] <symtab> anyone know why i get $ is not defined?
[01:16:35] <symtab> i'm losing my mind :(
[01:17:24] <obert> no, i am not modifying my code correctly
[01:17:31] <pixelpimp> jQuery's not defined yet.
[01:20:53] <symtab> pixelpimp, yeah i know...but why? i have jquery included
[01:21:22] <pixelpimp> After you use it.
[01:21:37] <symtab> where do i use it?
[01:21:39] <pixelpimp> You put it at the end to wait for the DOM to load, but that script is before it.
[01:21:47] <symtab> ahhh
[01:21:51] <symtab> let me change that
[01:21:53] <pixelpimp> Line 163, if memory serves.  I closed the tab already.
[01:24:36] <symtab> thank you
[01:26:49] <obert> var url = window.location.has; alert(url); should show me an url?
[01:27:01] <obert> *.hash
[01:27:37] <pixelpimp> No, it should show you the hash.
[01:28:11] <obert> it is empty. i am confused then
[01:28:22] <pixelpimp> What's the URL look like?
[01:28:41] <obert> in the alert?
[01:28:51] <obert> the alert is totally empty
[01:28:52] <pixelpimp> In your browser.  You just said the alert was empty.
[01:29:16] <obert> the url is just http://localhost/myproject/index.html
[01:29:26] <pixelpimp> Well, that's why.
[01:29:30] <pixelpimp> Your hash is obviously empty.
[01:29:56] <pixelpimp> I did say to do some research on that variable.  I quite distinctly recall that.
[01:29:57] <obert> i mean, i would to click on the <a> and the #foo
[01:30:12] <obert> bah, yeah.
[01:30:44] <obert> better retry with more slowness
[01:31:37] <pixelpimp> Are you sure you even need a script? What are you trying to accomplish?
[01:31:47] <pixelpimp> If you're trying to get a link to add a hash, there's no need for a script.
[01:37:28] <obert> pixelpimp: it is a gallery, atm i am creating a <img> inside the page that will shows the image when you click on the thumb
[01:38:35] <obert> but since the url doesnt changes by adding #foo in the browser bar, the anchor is not working
[01:38:57] <pixelpimp> So add #foo to the browser bar.
[01:39:10] <obert> hehe how
[01:39:16] <pixelpimp> Would be the default action of an <a>.
[01:40:02] <obert> yep, if it is not jquery generated
[01:40:09] <pixelpimp> No.
[01:40:22] <pixelpimp> Doesn't matter who or what generates it.  An <a> is an <a>.
[01:41:15] <obert> can i show you the page?
[01:42:32] <obert> hmm i made something but it is still wrong hehe
[01:42:34] <pixelpimp> Sure
[01:43:08] <obert> now i got the original big image loading in another page:)
[01:43:30] <obert> http://bit.ly/IN11XT
[01:45:49] <pixelpimp> and what's wrong with it?
[01:45:51] <obert> the stressfull point is that the i try to keep things as simple as possible and find still issues
[01:46:20] <obert> pixelpimp: if you click on a thumb, the url doesnt changes, then you are not redirected to the big image (#original)
[01:46:35] <obert> it will be always index.html instead index.html#original
[01:46:57] <pixelpimp> You're obviously preventing the default action when you click
[01:47:04] <obert> it is almost unsurfable
[01:47:15] <obert> hmmm
[01:47:52] <pixelpimp> line 431 of include.postload.js
[01:48:06] <obert> if i remove that it doesnt work as i would still
[01:48:43] <obert> cannot just show #foo in front of index.html normally?
[01:48:58] <pixelpimp> That's what the preventDefault is stopping
[01:49:00] <pixelpimp> Remove it.
[01:49:20] <obert> if i remove it, the image will be loaded in another window
[01:49:46] <pixelpimp> Why?  You're going to index.html and you're on index.html.
[01:49:46] <obert> check i
[01:49:50] <obert> check it.
[01:50:07] <pixelpimp> I think you're using a premade script and you don't know how it works.
[01:50:23] <pixelpimp> I would suggest learning how it works before trying to alter it.  Perhaps even write it from scratch, as it might be simpler.
[01:50:26] <obert> no, i wrote that by myself (more or less:P)
[01:50:48] <pixelpimp> Well, why did you prevent the default action of the link and then come in here asking how to reverse it?
[01:51:09] <obert> dont ask too many things:p
[01:51:31] <obert> i would to open the big image in the same window, a sort of ajax
[01:51:52] <obert> that's why i am .append(ing) the image in that #original place
[01:52:29] <obert> i wouldnt expect Spanish inquisition
[01:52:55] <pixelpimp> A link that goes to #hash will add the hash #hash to the URL.  No more, no less.
[01:53:18] <obert> why it doesnt happens there then?
[01:53:24] <obert> because of eventPrevent default?
[01:53:30] <pixelpimp> BECAUSE YOU'RE PREVENTING IT ON LINE 431
[01:53:36] <pixelpimp> I said that five minutes ago
[01:54:10] <slikts> I have a really dumb question: if I have a * b / c = x, b = ?
[01:54:12] <obert> ok i am definately confused then. sorry
[01:54:24] <obert> and thanks for your time
[01:54:32] <slikts> obert: definitely
[01:54:53] <pixelpimp> slikts: perhaps a better question for ##math
[01:55:08] <ravenzz> b = c*x/a
[01:57:47] <slikts> ravenzz: thx this helped
[01:58:05] <obert> anyway if i dont use preventDefault, the image will be not loaded inside <figure id="original">
[01:58:08] <slikts> forgot that 1 / x = x
[01:58:09] <obert> that's it
[02:02:21] <ravenzz> obert pushState is the answer!
[02:04:22] <obert> uhmf it should be window.location.hash the answer ravenzz:D
[02:04:45] <ravenzz> or
[02:04:54] <ravenzz> location.hash = "foo"
[02:05:01] <ravenzz> yeah
[02:05:59] <ravenzz> anyway it doesn't add so much in terms of usability
[02:06:03] <obert> pushstate is a plugin?
[02:06:57] <ravenzz> no it is an API that allows you to alterate the browser history
[02:07:42] <ravenzz> change the URL in the address bar
[02:07:53] <obert> i dont find it in the doc
[02:07:55] <obert> meh.
[02:08:05] <ravenzz> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/API/DOM/Manipulating_the_browser_history
[02:08:19] <obert> ah it is not jquery
[02:08:22] <obert> bah
[02:08:39] <ravenzz> who cares about jQuery!
[02:08:50] <ravenzz> it is still JS
[02:09:11] <obert> mhmh thanks
[02:10:11] <pixelpimp> 03:57 < obert> anyway if i dont use preventDefault, the image will be not loaded inside <figure id="original">
[02:10:15] <pixelpimp> ^- that is not what preventDefault does
[02:10:33] <pixelpimp> I see no reason why those two things would be related.
[02:11:04] <obert> pixelpimp: because if i remove it, when i click on a thumb, it will show the image on another window
[02:11:12] <obert> anyway i disturb you too much
[02:11:17] <pixelpimp> Well, why are you telling it to open in a new window?
[02:11:24] <pixelpimp> That is also unrelated.
[02:11:42] <obert> yep, i am in a loop. cannot explain more
[02:11:53] <obert> sorry and thanks to all
[02:12:13] <ravenzz> pixelpimp he want to load the pic in js without leaving the page AND he want to update the url
[02:12:28] <ravenzz> append #original to the url if I understood correctly
[02:12:50] <pixelpimp> Yep.
[02:13:02] <ravenzz> which is useless imo
[02:13:02] <obert> yup
[02:13:24] <ravenzz> so don't waste your time into this thing
[02:13:34] <obert> ravenzz: it isnt, imo, since if you click on a thumb you arent redirected to the big image
[02:13:52] <obert> so it is unusable at all
[02:14:07] <obert> no
[02:14:09] <obert> ?
[02:14:16] <ravenzz> if you want the pics to be linkable
[02:14:31] <ravenzz> you should change things a bit
[02:15:01] <ravenzz> maybe have a page that shows the pic like this /gallery/index.html?pic=foo.png
[02:15:03] <pixelpimp> I don't think that was what he wants.  If it is, he hasn't said anything to that affect.
[02:15:09] <obert> ravenzz: if you click on the thumb, and redirected where the big img is loaded, you will see the big image without have to scroll up and search it
[02:15:11] <ravenzz> then use pushState to change the url
[02:18:16] <obert> mhm
[02:19:42] <ravenzz> obert if you want it too look nicer you can also rewrite /gallery/show/picturename.png to /gallery/?pic=picturename.png in your htaccess
[02:20:41] <obert> i thought i need just a bit of modifications in the current script since i only need to modify the url
[02:21:47] <ravenzz> how it is suppose to look like?
[02:21:59] <ravenzz> /gallery/index.html#original?
[02:22:07] <obert> index.html#original after clicked on a thumb
[02:22:11] <ravenzz> ..
[02:22:19] <ravenzz> how that makes things better?
[02:22:34] <ravenzz> wtf is #original? there is no reference to the current pic
[02:22:37] <ravenzz> :P
[02:22:56] <obert> or maybe i am wrong.
[02:23:00] <ravenzz> that will just jump to the figure
[02:23:21] <obert> #original is <figure id="original"> where i am .append the generated <img>
[02:23:33] <ravenzz> yeah
[02:23:55] <pixelpimp> Which you're already linking to, but preventing the link from working for some unknown reason.
[02:23:58] <ravenzz> but the goal is to make those pics linkable right?
[02:24:36] <obert> ravenzz: the goal is to click on a thumb and see the big image without scroll up the page
[02:25:13] <pixelpimp> So why are you preventing it from going to #original?
[02:25:22] <ravenzz> so you want to scroll to the pic?
[02:25:24] <pixelpimp> You put code in there specifically to do just that and only that.
[02:25:42] <obert> infact i am confused now
[02:25:48] <ravenzz> :s
[02:25:54] <pixelpimp> I think you have been confused for a while.
[02:26:05] <ravenzz> would you like to explain me that in italian?
[02:26:16] <pixelpimp> Why are you using preventDefault if you don't want it to prevent the default action?
[02:26:22] <pixelpimp> You seemed unable to answer that previously
[02:27:00] <obert> pixelpimp: if i comment that, when you click on a thumb, you will go to http://myurl/gallery/imgs/foo.png instead load it inside <figure>
[02:27:15] <pixelpimp> Then it shouldn't link there
[02:27:32] <ravenzz> ..
[02:27:34] <pixelpimp> Or use window.location.hash like I first suggested, if you don't want to make the link go to the location you're expecting.
[02:28:02] <pixelpimp> Obviously a link to the image is more useful for graceful degradation and SEO.
[02:28:10] <ravenzz> or just scrollTo($('#original').position().top)
[02:29:03] <pixelpimp> scrollTo is a plugin, no?  Easily done with scrollTop on body (html for some older browsers)
[02:36:58] <ravenzz> pixelpimp yeah I meant scrollTop
[02:37:02] <Albatross54> http://pastebin.com/EcwjGcCw the following code is not running for me, and I DON'T have firebug running
[02:37:10] <ravenzz> and offset() instead of position()
[02:52:04] <obert> pixelpimp: fixed it (it is online already)
[02:52:06] <obert> :p
[04:01:10] <troop> hi

[04:20:53] <disorder> hi
[04:21:24] <disorder> I have a dom tree which is like    iframe #document html body
[04:21:43] <disorder> I can't select html or body elements
[04:21:46] <disorder> someone can help me?
[04:24:19] <pixelpimp> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy
[04:39:01] <disorder> pixelpimp: so I can't select those elements?
[04:39:36] <pixelpimp> If they fall victim to that policy, no.
[04:39:58] <disorder> ok
[05:01:21] <onur> Hi guys. How can I detach an event?

[05:41:10] <dex5> js localStoreage; how to create andappend to a local file andcan i make directories?
[06:05:28] <JackBauer24> dex5: you can't modify local storage files directly and you certainly can't make any directories.
[06:37:33] <toss2> any idea why skrollr is not working?
[06:37:47] <pixelpimp> because you did something wrong to make it not work
[06:38:06] <pixelpimp> I have no idea what skrollr is, but that was the most vague question you could have asked.
[06:38:57] <toss2> skroll is jquey plugin for paralax
[06:39:08] <toss2> i linked jquery skrollrs .js but nowt working
[06:39:21] <pixelpimp> I'm sure it takes more than that.  Did you read its documentation?
[06:44:29] <toss2> can I do this? xxx.animate.. ?
[06:44:40] <toss2> in xxx var I have stored one element
[06:44:50] <toss2> reference to dom node I mean
[06:45:29] <toss2> how can I use that element with xxx to animate?
[06:45:32] <toss2> pixelpimp ^
[06:46:37] <toss2> antone?
[06:46:40] <toss2> anyone?
[07:06:24] <Serdar> how do I get the results from a ajax post request?
[07:07:08] <Serdar> if I print keys in console I get these information: "readyState,getResponseHeader,getAllResponseHeaders,setRequestHeader,overrideMimeType,statusCode,abort,state,always,then,promise,pipe,done,fail,progress,complete,success,error"
[07:07:20] <Serdar> but I am not sure which one could contain my json string
[07:23:45] <ericandrewlewis> if i want to keep a div to an aspect ratio responsively, is it best practice to check on the resize event and manually set the height based on the aspect ratio?
[07:23:54] <ericandrewlewis> or is there a better way / toolkit i should be using?
[07:30:20] <ericandrewlewis> ooh

[09:39:29] <deveras> Hi guys, why does the last console.log give me false? http://jsfiddle.net/W4mJa/
[09:41:47] <deveras> one is an object, the other is a string. Calling .toString() on the object and checking for match also returns false. Is this some sort of bug?
[09:43:32] <Cork> deveras: your comparing a dom element with a string
[09:43:37] <Cork> and they arn't the same
[09:43:47] <Cork> name.eq(0).text() == 'a' should work
[09:43:48] <Shayanjm> hey, so I'm trying to build a really simple login page for my webapp. I have my login page with fields username & password. I need to POST that data to '/login', and if it's a success, redirect to '/app'
[09:43:57] <Shayanjm> for whatever reason, no matter what I do I can't seem to do the redirect
[09:44:18] <Cork> Shayanjm: use a normal http post instead of ajax
[09:44:26] <Cork> ajax can't redirect the page
[09:44:47] <Shayanjm> Cork: I need to post a JSON object to my post route
[09:44:54] <Shayanjm> how would I do that with a normal http post?
[09:45:08] <Cork> Shayanjm: then you need to return back an url and have the page load the second url
[09:45:14] <Cork> Shayanjm: you can't
[09:45:23] <Cork> unless you set the json to a hidden field
[09:45:40] <Shayanjm> that could work
[09:49:17] <Shayanjm> Cork: what would be the best methodology to constructing that json object as a hidden field and sending it?

[11:26:35] <ericandrewlewis> anyone familiar with a custom dropdown jquery plugin that can easily be skinned?
[11:27:19] <ericandrewlewis> i'd imagine something that finds <select> elements, hides them, and replaces them with a <div> and <ul>, which could easily be skinned with css
[11:27:37] <ericandrewlewis> well, doesn't replace them, but shoves in the custom <div> right next to it in the dom
[11:28:56] <ericandrewlewis> and some js for click and select of the custom elements to select the proper option on the actual <select> element
[11:33:34] <ericandrewlewis> maybe i'll just hack up select2
[11:54:34] <grafi> ericandrewlewis there are a few
[12:20:45] <quarters> hello. I was having issues with getting jquery code to load from an external file that I made, yet I'm able to load external files using other people's external js files.  I'm able to enter that same code into the html and it loads just fine and the path in the html is confirmed as valid.  Is this a good place to seek help?
[12:22:43] <JackBauer24> quarters: What is the error message?
[12:24:04] <quarters> JackBauer24> the jquery just doesn't "work".  The code is to have a red border added to all/any div.s on the site
[12:24:29] <quarters> unless there's a way to check for error messages in the browser that I'm not checking
[12:24:33] <quarters> I'm using chrome to test
[12:24:36] <JackBauer24> quarters: but does it throw any errors in the web console?

[12:39:04] <shoky> quarters:   'background': 'red'   or  background: 'red'
[12:39:12] <shoky> not with a comma
[12:39:19] <shoky> object literals have  key:value pairs
[12:39:25] <quarters> thanks shoky :)
[12:40:09] <shoky> quarters: er and also remove the ;
[12:40:59] <quarters> no more error messages but the divs don't change color
[12:41:01] <shoky> quarters: alternatively you can call .css without an object literal {..}, and then you do use the comma between the arguments:  .css('background', 'red')
[12:41:26] <quarters> cool
[12:41:50] <shoky> quarters:  in jsfiddle you don't put the full html, only what's inside <body>
[12:42:12] <shoky> quarters: and you include external resources by adding them on the left side
[12:42:37] <shoky> quarters: http://jsfiddle.net/2BBD7/2/
[12:44:18] <quarters> gotcha! thanks, shoky.  for some reason, this doesn't translate well locally
[12:44:51] <shoky> maybe you need to put your jquery code inside a $(document).ready handler
[12:45:16] <shoky> jsfiddle does that for you by default
[12:46:46] <quarters> well, whadda u know. it works now!
[12:46:51] <quarters> thanks again!

[14:38:07] <ddssc> I got a django.po translation file, how do I generate django.mo from it?
[14:41:03] <crowemi> Looking for some assistance - I'm getting a 403 error when trying to call a PHP script via $.get, the script is called three times within the user process and for some reason fails on the third call - also, so far, its only failing at a specific location
[14:44:59] <Diemuzi> ddssc: you could open it with PoEdit and then save the translations for the .mo format
[14:45:16] <crowemi> Looking for some assistance - I'm getting a 403 error when trying to call a PHP script via $.get, the script is called three times within the user process and for some reason fails on the third call - also, so far, its only failing at a specific location
[14:48:09] <ddssc> Diemuzi: thanks. will this work tho? isn't the standard way with django-admin.py compilemessages ?
[14:49:07] <Diemuzi> ddssc: never used that way before, but whenever i make translations i've always used poedit
[14:51:13] <crowemi> Looking for some assistance - I'm getting a 403 error when trying to call a PHP script via $.get, the script is called three times within the user process and for some reason fails on the third call - also, so far, its only failing at a specific location

[14:57:08] <coldhead> crowemi: i would guess you're passing different/bogus data on the 3rd request
[14:57:18] <coldhead> check out the network tab in your chrome inspector/firebug
[14:57:37] <coldhead> see what's actually being sent and returned in the header and response tabs
[14:58:43] <crowemi> coldhead: okay - its super weird because its only happening at a specific location - the clients offices where they have a windows domain setup
[14:58:56] <coldhead> oh wow
[14:59:00] <crowemi> lol
[14:59:03] <coldhead> i thought you meant a specific location in your code
[14:59:14] <coldhead> so that might be a firewall thing
[14:59:29] <crowemi> I'm confused why its working the first three times though
[14:59:31] <crowemi> ops
[14:59:34] <coldhead> i've seen situations where some firewalls deliberately mangle data on its way through
[14:59:36] <crowemi> first two times at clients site
[14:59:40] <coldhead> if it sees something they deem "suspicious"
[14:59:53] <coldhead> which is why you want to see what's actually getting through
[14:59:55] <crowemi> hm.. is there something I can do to the array prior to sending?
[14:59:58] <crowemi> yeah
[14:59:59] <coldhead> maybe check the PHP logs
[15:00:09] <crowemi> yeah
[15:00:46] <crowemi> I'm just passing an array as a parameter in the $.get() - I've bee researching encoding
[15:01:07] <crowemi> if its at the clients, I can control that, but I can't control any other users that try to access the site
[15:01:39] <coldhead> i'd try converting the data to JSON and sending that
[15:01:44] <coldhead> rather than letting jquery encode
[15:01:56] <coldhead> i'm not even sure it would help but it seems a reasonable thing to try
[15:02:14] <crowemi> hmm.. okay, is there a built in function for that?
[15:02:27] <coldhead> JSON.stringify
[15:02:29] <crowemi> or do I need to build it out as a string
[15:02:32] <crowemi> SaWeeeet!
[15:02:48] <crowemi> do you typically do that for all JSON ajax requests?
[15:02:50] <crowemi> regardless
[15:03:25] <coldhead> only when i get into trouble
[15:03:34] <coldhead> like the trouble you're describing
[15:03:42] <coldhead> usually jquery does the right thing
[15:04:13] <crowemi> yeah - I'll so some more troubleshooting - thanks for the ideas
[15:04:40] <coldhead> godspeed
[15:09:02] <crowemi> coldhead: looking at the Chrome network - it appears the 403 response is being sent back from a completely different server
[15:09:08] <crowemi> Server: GoAhead WebServer
[15:09:14] <crowemi> bad response
[15:09:24] <crowemi> Server:Apache
[15:09:26] <crowemi> good response
[15:10:19] <coldhead> so maybe the firewall is blocking it >:\
[15:10:56] <crowemi> hmm.. thats super weird
[15:11:04] <crowemi> how can I get around that on my end?
[15:11:25] <coldhead> that's just my best guess for what's going on
[15:11:31] <crowemi> yeah
[15:11:37] <crowemi> seems reasonable
[15:11:40] <coldhead> you probably want to try to work out why that might be happening if it is
[15:12:10] <crowemi> is there anything I can do to force it to my Apache server?
[15:13:51] <ddssc> Diemuzi: there are no options to save as .mo in poEdit
[15:21:07] <JackBauer24> ddssc: .mo files are automatically generated when saving .po file
[15:26:14] <Diemuzi> ddssc: Once you open the .po file you'll set your translated text and then upon save it will spit out a .mo file for you
[15:35:42] <coldhead> crowemi: i think you need to figure out why it's sending it to that other server before you can figure out how to stop it
[15:35:55] <crowemi> true
[15:36:09] <crowemi> I think its something specific to what is happening in my jQuery
[15:36:24] <coldhead> do you want to show some code?
[15:36:31] <crowemi> sure
[15:36:41] <crowemi> let me get it setup and I'll send you the link
[15:41:48] <crowemi> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/crowemi/9P6bU/1/#&togetherjs=D6vcqoiejM
[15:41:50] <crowemi> try that
[15:42:07] <crowemi> its been a while since i used jsfiddle - might have shared it incorrectly
[15:49:29] <crowemi> coldhead: so here is something to spice it up - I changed the code within the third iteration of the call to use the first iteration and it works fine -- so I'm fairly certain its something within that third iteration jquery
[15:49:48] <crowemi> if you can access that jsfiddle I can show you what I did

[17:19:10] <daveaway> 'lo, with jqueryUI and resizable, i cant see to find how to make it smaller than the handle allows
[17:19:12] <daveaway> is it possible?
[17:19:21] <daveaway> oh, i didnt try negative width/sheights
[17:19:39] <petey> lol coldhead
[17:19:55] <petey> anyone have any ways of going about learning how to do so? tw2113, coldhead? active link states on scrolling page?
[17:20:14] <coldhead> googling for that exact phrase gives a lot of stack overflow posts
[17:20:26] <coldhead> there's probably 5 jquery libs to do it for you to
[17:20:29] <coldhead> too*
[17:20:34] <daveaway> could check scroll height
[17:20:59] <petey> ah you're right
[17:21:03] <petey> i was googling the wrong thing
[17:22:45] <petey> how do you go about learning how to do something?
[17:22:50] <petey> its so easy to google and just change values
[17:23:14] <petey> i guess I should have just tried writing it on my own
[17:23:41] <daveaway> anyone know how to get around the min-height restriction with .resizable() ?
[17:23:57] <daveaway> i've already used 'min-width:0'
[17:25:21] <daveaway> is it because of the SE handle?
[17:28:58] <daveaway> wow, im an idiot XD nevermind

[17:30:45] <daveaway> think my image tagger is complete
[17:30:50] <daveaway> was the thing i left to the end for some reason
[17:33:55] <petey> can anyone here let me know what this means? offsetTop = href === "#" ? 0 : $(href).offset().top-topMenuHeight+1;
[17:34:05] <petey> I get the ternary ending but the equal signs are a little scary
[17:37:07] <JaimsDC> ok so asinging href to offsetTop - triple equals can be thought of as an equivelance operator
[17:37:19] <JaimsDC> as opposed to an equality operator
[17:37:41] <JaimsDC> ah sorry
[17:37:43] <shoky> petey: it's equivalent to:  if (href === "#") { offsetTop = 0; } else { offsetTop = $(href).offset().top-topMenuHeight+1; }
[17:37:54] <petey> ah okay, thanks shoky
[17:38:10] <JaimsDC> I'm tired - offsetTop is either going to be true / 1 or 0  / false
[17:38:57] <petey> ah jaimsDC I didn't even see that! I appreciate it as well, thanks

[17:46:54] <slickerslick> Question: http://pastie.org/8554886    this function works the first time. next time, won't grey out.. any ideas why?
[18:02:27] <shoky> `demo @ slickerslick
[18:02:27] <b-ot> slickerslick: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[18:02:44] <petey> Can anyone tell me why I can't add a class to just the A element here? http://jsfiddle.net/up4nu/1991/
[18:03:00] <petey> Adding to the parent element works fine, but I want to add it to the 'a' tag instead of the 'li'
[18:04:24] <shoky> petey: that .end() at the end doesn't make any sense
[18:05:01] <shoky> oh or maybe it does? never thought to use it like that
[18:05:28] <petey> If you have a better method for it, please let me know. This is a learning experience
[18:05:44] <petey> I'm googling each function but I don't know why removing .parent() breaks everything?
[18:06:22] <shoky> it seems like you're using .map when you should be using .filter
[18:06:50] <petey> so .map breaks everything down to an array right? I'm assuming I can use .find or .each for that as well?
[18:07:01] <shoky> map returns an array of the same length as the original
[18:07:06] <shoky> each item is mapped to whatever you return
[18:07:25] <petey> Ah okay, .filter looks sweet too
[18:08:20] <petey> so by using .filter, I could get rid of topMenu.find('a') too right?
[18:08:43] <petey> I can just do scrollItems = topMenu.filter('a')
[18:10:11] <shoky> mmm no
[18:10:36] <shoky> topMenu.find('a')  is fine
[18:10:48] <shoky> donno what you're asking, really ;p
[18:11:16] <petey> I'd just like to set the active state on the 'a' rather than the 'li'
[18:11:46] <petey> In that example, menuItems is adding an active class to the li tag - the parent of the a. Removing .parent() does not do anything, it does not add it to the a tag
[18:12:28] <shoky> what do you mean.. menuItems is adding ?
[18:12:31] <toss2> please can someone tell me if I can see youtube channel partner and send messages to channel through Youtube API?
[18:12:39] <shoky> and, i don't see .parent() anywhere
[18:12:56] <petey> Hold on a sec, I removed it.

[18:13:25] <petey> line 43-45
[18:13:37] <petey> menuItems.parent.removeClass("active") ...

[18:15:01] <funhouse> Hi guys, does it matter how many jquery construct functions I use, or should everything be inside one only?

[22:34:36] <Starcraftmazter> one option is to save this just before the function

[22:43:55] <alpha232> pixelpimp, I'm fairly new so an existing library, like say, a rich text editor that can store the changes/markup outside of the document to reapply later.
[22:43:57] <grafi> sounds interesting though ^^

[22:46:35] <pixelpimp> I've written a similar concept to that above one for QA feedback on websites, but it's so far from done and completely useless :P
[22:46:44] <grafi> a bit more detail would be helpful i guess
[22:46:46] <pixelpimp> Which would likely be more fitting for your needs...
[22:46:53] <alpha232> pixelpimp, yes, I have found various rich editors but all edit the actual content
[22:46:56] <grafi> like how exactly the result would look
[22:47:27] <alpha232> grafi, ok let me high level this with some common ideas.
[22:47:35] <pixelpimp> The library I'm working on attaches notes to DOM elements
[22:47:45] <alpha232> pixelpimp, nice.
[22:48:01] <pixelpimp> Unfortunately right now it's just the UI; on refresh, everything's gone again
[22:48:04] <alpha232> The user would highlight a passage of plain text in a textarea or div...
[22:48:38] <alpha232> then through some form of interaction a context menu appears to select from a tree of options.
[22:48:52] <pixelpimp> http://acdlite.github.io/jquery.sidenotes/ !
[22:48:55] <pixelpimp> This looks great
[22:49:28] <alpha232> it would store the location of the text selected, and log the option selected.
[22:50:01] <alpha232> the listing of locations/option "flag" would be used to mark the text on display.
[22:50:01] <grafi> and what options could there be?
[22:50:15] <Starcraftmazter> if this makes sense; if you have a prototype JS class, and you have multiple things inside of it, how do you access one thing from another?
[22:51:07] <alpha232> grafi, well for our QA purposes there are 15-20 different QA rules.  Spelling and punctuation, grammar, and so on.
[22:51:22] <grafi> ok
[22:51:24] <alpha232> pixelpimp, looking at the sidenotes now.
[22:51:37] <Starcraftmazter> http://jsfiddle.net/qsw4m/
[22:51:41] <Starcraftmazter> that should explain it
[22:52:14] <alpha232> grafi, eventually, all the markup is stored in the database and can be used to both grade the chat and also re-markup the text for review by the agent.
[22:52:56] <grafi> so the basic is, save selections of text chunks + the option applied
[22:52:58] <alpha232> Think of it as a digital highlighter.
[22:53:09] <grafi> being able to reapply the stuff you saved
[22:53:12] <alpha232> grafi, no, just the location of the text to be highlighted.
[22:53:27] <grafi> yeah, that might not be what i said
[22:53:31] <grafi> but what i meant
[22:53:31] <grafi> :D
[22:53:35] <vinex08> repost - what was this effect called? http://pexetothemes.com/demos/mineral_wp/    - Meet the team section ( Circle Thumbnails)
[22:53:38] <alpha232> yep
[22:53:51] <grafi> like you save the startpoint/endpoint of the selected text
[22:53:56] <alpha232> yes.
[22:54:01] <grafi> and the option
[22:54:04] <grafi> hm
[22:54:17] <grafi> this sounds managable actually
[22:54:18] <grafi> ^^
[22:54:51] <alpha232> grafi, I know, I am just trying to find something almost there. I am fairly new and this is an unpaid thing... well... not quite but pretty much extra work, no extra pay.
[22:55:04] <grafi> gotcha
[22:55:10] <alpha232> I'm one of the chat agents, I wrote a system that pulls the chat client logs and various other fun stuff.
[22:55:24] <Starcraftmazter> anyone?
[22:55:53] <alpha232> So parsing the file and everything is easy for me, but js and ui stuff... well i'm about 15 years out of practice.
[22:56:07] <grafi> :)
[22:57:04] <grafi> http://rangy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/saverestore.html alpha232
[22:57:13] <grafi> this thing can save selection(s)
[22:57:24] <grafi> not sure how it does it though
[22:57:26] <grafi> :P
[22:57:42] <alpha232> hah yes.
[22:58:02] <alpha232> but yes
[22:59:08] <alpha232> The downside is that I would need to edit the text in memory to add divs or spans to apply visual style
[22:59:33] <grafi> well how else would you do it?
[23:00:12] <alpha232> I didn't suggest there was but it is somewhat blah but still not bad.
[23:01:02] <grafi> the docs suck though :p
[23:01:24] <alpha232> oo hohh
[23:01:25] <alpha232> grafi, that's just the first pass at it
[23:01:26] <alpha232> oops
[23:01:29] <alpha232> http://rangyinputs.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demos/textinputs_jquery.html
[23:01:33] <alpha232> dang dual clipboard
[23:02:08] <grafi> hm thats a cool project
[23:02:23] <alpha232> Yup Yup, turn the tool bar into a context based menu.
[23:05:17] <alpha232> grafi, that is pretty much exactly what I need to start with.
[23:05:25] <grafi> yeah
[23:05:35] <grafi> :P
[23:05:48] <grafi> so good luck with that then ^^
[23:05:59] <alpha232> lol.
[23:06:14] <alpha232> Yep time to learn js along the way.
[23:07:20] <grafi> haha ^^
[23:07:28] <grafi> so
[23:07:43] <grafi> you are planning on adding markup to the text though, or not?
[23:07:51] <grafi> to make the "selection" more permanent?
[23:07:53] <alpha232> dang key binding
[23:08:00] <alpha232> well that should be really easy.
[23:08:11] <grafi> i wonder if that fucks with the saved selection stuff though
[23:08:21] <grafi> probably maybe does
[23:08:30] <alpha232> how do you mean?
[23:08:39] <alpha232> ohhh
[23:08:53] <grafi> adding markup means changing the text, meaning the positions you saved dont match anymore
[23:09:01] <alpha232> You mean if I apply <span> to something, now I will have that markup changing positions.
[23:09:07] <alpha232> grafi, easy fix for that :)
[23:09:15] <grafi> like what?
[23:09:39] <grafi> oh maybe
[23:09:42] <grafi> nevermind ^^
[23:09:46] <alpha232> First, apply it in reverse.
[23:09:50] <alpha232> highest char position first.
[23:09:58] <grafi> yeah
[23:10:15] <alpha232> But if they want to go back and comment after some were added...
[23:10:16] <alpha232> Hmm.
[23:10:29] <grafi> oh
[23:10:31] <grafi> hm
[23:10:53] <alpha232> That's the part of "in band" crap
[23:11:24] <grafi> the edge case will be problematic
[23:11:25] <grafi> ^^
[23:11:45] <grafi> but something working should be easy to set up
[23:11:47] <alpha232> Considering that more than one person may be responsible for grading...
[23:12:06] <alpha232> It is not an out of scope requirement.
[23:12:49] <alpha232> A manager and an SME may both access the chat to grade it.
[23:12:50] <grafi> well you can figure that out when its too late :D
[23:12:53] <vinex08> help? http://jsfiddle.net/eVRLd/  im trying to immitate the effect i posted a while ago
[23:13:08] <alpha232> grafi, that would be now lol as this is currently a paper process.
[23:13:21] <grafi> vinex08 what effect was that?
[23:13:24] <alpha232> I still need to work the back end cruft of pulling the transcripts and such.
[23:13:31] <vinex08> repost - what was this effect called? http://pexetothemes.com/demos/mineral_wp/    - Meet the team section ( Circle Thumbnails)
[23:13:58] <grafi> oO
[23:14:02] <grafi> for realsies?
[23:14:36] <vinex08> maybe a simple slideup, fade in effect
[23:16:10] <funhouse> Hi there, having an issue with draggable and droppable, I have a click event attached to my draggable element, but when I drop it, the event is removed, whats up with that?
[23:17:41] <alpha232> blah
[23:20:05] <funhouse> blah is right
[23:21:08] <Rashad> Hello.
[23:22:19] <Rashad> I am getting an error which says: Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token {  in jquery.js:612
[23:22:23] <alpha232> grafi, ok this is gonna sound weird but...
[23:22:40] <Rashad> I am including jQuery from Google.
[23:23:05] <Rashad> This is line 612 in jquery.js: window[ "eval" ].call( window, data );
[23:23:20] <vinex08> ehem..
[23:23:45] <alpha232> grafi, put two divs over each other, same exact position.  Front copy has the text on transparent background, back copy replaces every character with a space.
[23:24:28] <Cork> Rashad: your sending js through ajax, and it has an error
[23:24:41] <Cork> most likely your sending js but intend to send json
[23:24:59] <alpha232> grafi, selection occurs on the top layer, markup is applied to the bottom layer, last to first, redraws every update.
[23:25:13] <koneko> hi guys
[23:25:24] <Rashad> Cork: I am using socket.IO, not ajax.
[23:25:43] <Cork> Rashad: ajax means sending data with xmlhttprequest; so you most likely are
[23:25:54] <Rashad> Aha.
[23:25:58] <Cork> Rashad: either way your sending dynamic js
[23:25:58] <grafi> sounds complicated alpha232
[23:25:59] <grafi> :D
[23:26:01] <vinex08> anyone? http://jsfiddle.net/eVRLd/  im trying to get the image slideup when the scroll reached a certain div
[23:26:08] <Cork> Rashad: and that is failing to parse
[23:26:20] <alpha232> grafi, kinda but not really.
[23:26:27] <grafi> ^^
[23:26:27] <Cork> Rashad: look for the request you get directly before the error
[23:26:33] <Cork> Rashad: and validate the js in it
[23:27:25] <alpha232> grafi, it keeps the "selected" locations constant from the top layer, reapplication from the end of the text keeps it constant on the bottom layer.
[23:27:38] <grafi> yeah that at least
[23:27:58] <grafi> spaces are probably no good replacement for letters though
[23:28:13] <alpha232> grafi, if I used a fixed font, it should be fine.
[23:28:23] <grafi> was just about to say that ^^
[23:28:27] <alpha232> Or transparent text.
[23:28:49] <Rashad> Cork: I am using .load(), does that count?
[23:28:57] <Cork> yes
[23:29:04] <alpha232> Time to build a test html.
[23:29:11] <Rashad> But that used to work before.. I only change some socket.IO code.
[23:29:20] <alpha232> lol but now I need to figure out the css lol
[23:32:32] <koneko> vinex08, http://jsfiddle.net/eVRLd/2/ something like this?
[23:34:32] <Cork> alpha232: just remove the js from the html, let it append it and run the js manually
[23:34:43] <Cork> should make this simple
[23:35:37] <alpha232> Cork, sorry?
[23:36:03] <vinex08> koneko: yes, but as soon the div #thumbnails-cont  hits the screen i would like it to have a smooth fadein
[23:37:24] <Cork> alpha232: ugg sorry wrong nick
[23:39:50] <koneko> vinex08, http://jsfiddle.net/eVRLd/3/
[23:40:22] <alpha232> grafi, you still alive?
[23:40:30] <grafi> no im dead
[23:40:31] <alpha232> grafi, http://jsfiddle.net/kQLqV/
[23:40:32] <grafi> :(
[23:40:40] <alpha232> Dang, sorry bro I'm not into necro.
[23:40:48] <grafi> lawl
[23:40:55] <alpha232> that's sad.
[23:41:22] <grafi> saving pixels now?
[23:41:38] <alpha232> Thought it would bit it didn't/
[23:42:11] <alpha232> grafi, what I guess I need is to put a div around the transcript, then use js to create an exact duplicate in the exact same position.
[23:43:25] <vinex08> koneko: perfect.. so do you consider this as optimized already?
[23:44:31] <Rashad> Cork: I found my error, thanks.
[23:44:47] <koneko> Depends whether it should hide when it slides out of the screen, etc. maybe you'll need to adjust the animate method to your needs, but all in all it's generic enough to work regardless of your CSS I think
[23:45:27] <alpha232> ok bed time, thanks for the sounding board
[23:46:49] <grafi> bed time
[23:46:54] <grafi> its 9am ^^
[23:48:18] <koneko> GMT+1, the best timezone
[23:48:21] <vinex08> woo http://jsfiddle.net/eVRLd/4/ i have made some progress :)
[23:50:01] <vinex08> now its just fading in. what if i want to combine the 2? fading in and sliding up? possible?
[23:50:37] <alpha232> 1:50am here.
[23:57:47] <koneko> vinex08, animate({opacity: 1, bottom: 0})
[23:59:39] <iaj> Hey there.
[23:59:47] <vinex08> it didnt slideup http://jsfiddle.net/eVRLd/5/
[23:59:56] <iaj> I got a question, is it possible to check for system requirements and depending on those generate a certain effect?
