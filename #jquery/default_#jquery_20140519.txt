[00:01:04] <d3m0n> Can someone tell me why the variable here doesn't work - http://codepen.io/jstn/pen/fbtpr
[00:04:54] <Cork> d3m0n: cause you can't have a <p> that is a parent of window
[00:05:38] <d3m0n> Cork: So the variable is set before the click?
[00:05:48] <d3m0n> Cork: My assumption is it get sets once it's called
[00:05:55] <d3m0n> According to location
[00:06:01] <Cork> d3m0n: no $par is set when you set it
[00:06:19] <d3m0n> Ok Cork, thanks.
[00:06:20] <Cork> js doesn't have lacy evaluation
[00:06:33] <Cork> d3m0n: also you most likely want to use .closest() not .parents()
[00:06:47] <Cork> (or parent()
[00:06:49] <Cork> )
[00:06:56] <d3m0n> Well it is parent() atm
[00:07:22] <d3m0n> Is one faster than the other?
[00:07:24] <Cork> d3m0n: .parent('p') will give you an empty result if the parent isn't a 'p'
[00:07:43] <d3m0n> Ok good to know
[00:07:44] <Cork> .closest('p') finds the closest parent that is a p
[00:07:58] <Cork> .parent() only goes one step up
[00:08:24] <Cork> and .parents() collects them all, so you might get more then you bargained for
[00:28:36] <unnu> Undefined is not a function, can i not just select <img id="myImage"/> with $.('#myImage')
[00:28:58] <unnu> no .
[00:29:08] <unnu> just $('#myImage')
[00:29:26] <unnu> is that wrong? my head is spinning and I am starting to get pissed off
[00:29:40] <d3m0n> Gotta post the rest of the js but you can select it like that
[00:30:19] <Cork> unnu: yes that last one is correct
[00:30:29] <Cork> unnu: as long as you don't have another element with the same id
[00:30:47] <unnu> i guess i am doing something wrong because i am getting "Undefined is not a function" and console is highlighting it
[00:31:15] <Cork> unnu: sounds like you don't have jquery loaded
[00:31:32] <unnu> <script src="//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
[00:31:44] <unnu> then i am using $(document).ready(function(){
[00:32:02] <Cork> what is giving you the undefined error?
[00:32:18] <Cork> cause $() NEVER returns undefined
[00:33:07] <unnu> $('#myImage').cropper();         (cropper being the file i am loading right after jquery)               '#myImage' is undefined
[00:33:14] <unnu> is it something with cropper?
[00:33:30] <unnu> http://fengyuanchen.github.io/cropper/
[00:33:44] <Cork> unnu: you need to make a demo of this
[00:33:49] <unnu> i know
[00:33:50] <Cork> but ya, something is broken
[00:33:56] <unnu> alright Cork
[00:33:58] <Cork> hard to tell what
[00:33:59] <unnu> give me a min
[00:34:45] <Cork> '#myImage' is undefined makes me suspect that something is breaking jquery
[00:40:54] <unnu> Cork: i put it on jsfiddle (had to copy paste the contents of the .min file so it looks super ugly) and it works there
[00:41:09] <unnu> let me see if anything else is messing with JS
[00:44:24] <unnu> Cork: where should i include jquery and the local JS file?
[00:44:27] <unnu> head?
[00:44:40] <Cork> un jsfiddle or locally?
[00:44:43] <Cork> in
[00:44:44] <unnu> locally
[00:44:48] <unnu> well, on the server
[00:44:51] <Cork> jquery should be in head
[00:45:01] <Cork> the local js file you can include where you like
[00:45:11] <Cork> end of body or in head
[00:45:13] <Cork> both works
[00:45:16] <unnu> i am using google's CDN for jquery
[00:45:27] <unnu> i will throw it at the end of body so jquery is loaded for sure
[00:46:25] <Whiskey> http://jsfiddle.net/j2Z9u/ <-- How do i get the timer to count up after its count down to 0?
[00:46:28] <unnu> OMG DUDE, NVM my other developer put fucking jquery in the footer include
[00:48:14] <unnu> 25 diffrent JS files i didn't even know were being included
[00:48:38] <unnu> Theres my problem
[00:48:55] <unnu> something is breakign jquery in one of those 25 files . . . . any easy way to debug that?
[00:50:24] <traviata> I'm having a bit of trouble with my logic and hoping someone can help: http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/3/  - I'm trying to make it so that when I scroll, it'll scroll down until the bottom of the image shows up at the bottom of the screen where it'll remain fixed while the text keeps scrolling. (kind of like this http://snag.gy/DLqsr.jpg where the image is fixed and text keeps scrolling)
[01:00:20] <unnu> var tpj=jQuery;
[01:00:20] <unnu> 		tpj.noConflict();
[01:00:34] <Cork> Whiskey: the base of your code is flawed
[01:00:47] <Cork> Whiskey: you can't count on setInterval to fire every second
[01:00:48] <unnu> thats what is breaking it Cork
[01:01:13] <Cork> Whiskey: you should always get the current time in the timer loop (and i recommend using setTimeout instead of setInterval)
[01:01:31] <Cork> unnu: so you need to use tpj instead of $
[01:01:55] <unnu> can i not just replace tpj with $ in the little script?
[01:02:10] <unnu> its maybe 20 lines
[01:12:24] <Cork> bah...
[01:12:35] <Cork> i love it when ppl ask a question and then leave right away >_<
[01:13:00] <Cork> if traviata comes again => http://jsfiddle.net/ZgX3a/4/
[01:14:30] <brunoais> Cork, ya know, right?
[01:14:32] <brunoais> btw
[01:14:37] <brunoais> did you see my example?
[01:14:46] <Cork> example of what?
[01:16:01] <brunoais> Cork, http://brunoaisserver.dtdns.net/provingIt.php
[01:16:07] <Cork> ah, that one
[01:16:14] <Cork> ya, and i didn't get any flashing
[01:16:27] <brunoais> Cork, there's no flashing
[01:16:36] <brunoais> see if you spot any text before the alert
[01:16:49] <brunoais> in which brwoser are you?
[01:20:06] <brunoais> Cork, did you try it now?
[01:27:07] <CrowX-> what's the preferred way to change an element's background? simply add a class in css stating the other background, and then add that class to the element with javascript?
[01:27:40] <Cork> CrowX-: yes
[01:27:57] <Cork> you want to keep as much of the styling in the css file as possible
[01:29:06] <CrowX-> also, if an element has the class .classA, does element.addClass('classA') do nothing?
[01:29:30] <Cork> CrowX-: ya
[01:29:32] <CrowX-> and does it make things slower, i.e. should I make checks first?
[01:34:19] <brunoais> CrowX-, jQuery does not do checks
[01:35:10] <Cork> brunoais: actually it does in this case
[01:35:21] <brunoais> hum...
[01:35:28] <brunoais> they changed it, then :)
[01:35:29] <brunoais> nice
[01:35:29] <Cork> CrowX-: no the checks is close to what you would do your self
[01:35:35] <Cork> brunoais: huh?
[01:35:46] <Cork> brunoais: we're talking about addClass here
[01:35:57] <brunoais> yep
[01:35:57] <Cork> and it has always done those checks
[01:36:04] <brunoais> really O_O?
[01:36:15] <brunoais> I don't remember that when I red the code
[01:36:18] <Cork> the point of addClass is that you don't get duplicates
[01:36:21] <brunoais> maybe I got lost or something
[01:36:33] <brunoais> yes
[01:36:45] <brunoais> What I remember is an add and then remove duplicates
[01:37:04] <Cork> and copied from the code 'cur.indexOf( " " + clazz + " " ) < 0'
[01:37:34] <Cork> you will find similar code back from the very start of addClass
[01:37:52] <brunoais> using classList (which jQuery does not use), at least, for latest stable firefox, the browser does not do anything. If you use the className, it sometimes repaints...
[01:38:00] <brunoais> Oh
[01:38:34] <brunoais> so it reads the className value from the Node, then it sees if it is already there. if it is not, then adds it
[01:38:34] <brunoais> ok
[01:39:08] <Cork> brunoais: ya, using the string or the newer classList doesn't make much difference
[01:39:27] <Cork> btw
[01:39:37] <Cork> the original jquery check return new RegExp("(^|\\s)" + a + "(\\s|$)").test(e);
[01:39:44] <Cork> i would say it was less optimal XD
[01:40:23] <brunoais> right. indexOf does not use regex so it's way faster.
[01:40:24] <Cork> but the current check is fast and not really worth worring about (if you ever need to do that you prob need to go raw native js anyway)
[01:40:33] <brunoais> yep
[01:40:38] <brunoais> I agree on that
[01:42:54] <brunoais> btw, I still use classList instead of jQuery's addClass and I still almost don't use jQuery :D
[01:43:19] <brunoais> for support to older stuff, I use polyfills
[01:43:47] <brunoais> I only use jQuery for obscure APIs with bugs
[02:05:45] <CrowX-> can I use jquery animate to scale an element's size from 0 to auto?
[02:06:12] <Cork> CrowX-: depends on the element
[02:06:24] <CrowX-> it's an image
[02:06:29] <beancurd> CrowX-: i don't think so? but you can scale it to item.height?
[02:06:30] <brunoais> CrowX-, with CSS animations you can
[02:06:40] <CrowX-> brunoais, with transition?
[02:06:49] <Cork> transition can
[02:06:53] <Cork> and so can animate()
[02:06:55] <brunoais> CrowX-, yes
[02:07:07] <Cork> transform: size(); is the simplest value to animate though
[02:07:17] <CrowX-> so like "transition: height 0.5s ease;" would do?
[02:07:17] <Cork> and ya i would use css animation
[02:07:25] <Cork> CrowX-: transform
[02:07:31] <CrowX-> ok
[02:07:34] <brunoais> CrowX-, yes. Then you add a CSS class to make it grow
[02:07:47] <Cork> css can't animate height to auto
[02:07:49] <brunoais> Oh right. Thanks for the correction
[02:07:59] <brunoais> Cork, how come?
[02:08:05] <Cork> brunoais: it isn't in the spec
[02:08:14] <brunoais> well, actual animations can't but transitions I believe it can
[02:08:22] <Cork> NO
[02:08:30] <brunoais> I didn't make something exactly like that though
[02:08:31] <Cork> you can't animate to height: auto in css
[02:08:38] <brunoais> hum...
[02:08:44] <brunoais> I gotta test that, then
[02:08:48] <Cork> sigh
[02:08:52] <brunoais> I was positive I could
[02:08:53] <Cork> or just google
[02:09:00] <brunoais> as I had made something similar.
[02:09:01] <Cork> you should find like 5000000000000 questions about it
[02:09:17] <Cork> its the most commonly asked css transision question
[02:09:40] <Cork> (and as @keyframe uses the same logic it has the same limitations)
[02:10:19] <brunoais> Ah... saw it
[02:10:27] <brunoais> sounds like I was wrong all along
[02:10:38] <brunoais> but I found this that might help :S Not sure, though
[02:10:39] <brunoais> http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/animating_height/
[02:10:47] <Cork> brunoais: please check your answers at least a little before answering questions
[02:10:57] <brunoais> if it is an image, I have mixed ideas
[02:11:10] <brunoais> Cork, I had made something similar recently
[02:11:44] <Cork> brunoais: the only thing that can animate to height: auto correctly is js
[02:11:50] <brunoais> let me check...
[02:11:58] <Cork> there are hacks with serious problems you can use in css
[02:12:03] <Cork> through max-height
[02:12:15] <Cork> but that is it
[02:15:46] <brunoais> Cork, Ah! found it. It's the container, not the content. I mixed them up
[02:16:01] <Cork> brunoais: doesn't really change anything
[02:16:09] <Cork> you can't animate height: auto; period
[02:16:23] <brunoais> it just explains what happened with my mistake
[02:16:28] <brunoais> yeah, sounds like it
[02:16:34] <Cork> or actually you can't animate "auto"
[02:16:40] <Cork> no matter where it is
[02:16:42] <brunoais> I wonder why...
[02:16:58] <Cork> cause auto doesn't have a defined css value
[02:17:05] <brunoais> It has
[02:17:08] <Cork> no
[02:17:13] <brunoais> it needs calculations
[02:17:18] <Cork> exactly
[02:17:23] <Cork> rendering calculates the value
[02:17:28] <Cork> === no css defined value
[02:17:42] <brunoais> so... it needs an explicit height value?
[02:17:47] <Cork> yes
[02:17:54] <Cork> like i said it isn't about height
[02:17:57] <Cork> it is about auto
[02:18:00] <brunoais> ups
[02:18:08] <brunoais> explicit value
[02:18:31] <brunoais> it's weird that max-height works...
[02:18:39] <Cork> not really
[02:18:40] * brunoais checking the default varue
[02:18:44] <Cork> you don't use auto there...
[02:19:05] <Cork> and that is why those hacks has a problem
[02:19:06] <brunoais> Ah
[02:19:14] <Cork> you animate from something like 10000px to 0px
[02:19:17] <brunoais> you set a super high value, right?
[02:19:30] <brunoais> but then...
[02:19:30] <Cork> and just assume 10000 will be enough to never be too low
[02:19:34] <Cork> exactly
[02:19:39] <Cork> the animation gets messed up
[02:19:51] <brunoais> in that case, you actually know the ending value, don't you?
[02:20:01] <Cork> depends
[02:20:06] <Cork> you know the ending value for max-height
[02:20:13] <Cork> but not the ending value for the visible element
[02:21:28] <brunoais> it still needs calculations on that end. You only know the max height you can get, not the height you'll get to
[02:21:36] <brunoais> still, firefox does it right here
[02:21:41] <brunoais> http://css3.bradshawenterprises.com/animating_height/
[02:21:49] <Cork> brunoais: no
[02:22:04] <Cork> max-height will change to the value you set
[02:22:05] <brunoais> there must be something else
[02:22:17] <Cork> and like always height is adjusted until it doesn't want to be heigher
[02:22:29] <Cork> meaning if you animate in you will get a delay at the beginning
[02:22:45] <Cork> if you animate out you will get the wrong flow if you are using anything but linear
[02:24:33] <mbn_18> How can I do something like this? (I understand that its no longer possible to use attribute selector for properties). $('button [disabled="disabled"]');
[02:25:23] <brunoais> mbn_18, it's already done
[02:25:38] <brunoais> you want an element that is disabled inside the <button> element
[02:26:20] <mbn_18> brunoais: No,  I want to enable the buttons which are disabled
[02:27:18] <brunoais> mbn_18, then your selector is wrong
[02:27:24] <brunoais> remove the space
[02:29:09] <brunoais> mbn_18, did it solve?
[02:31:24] <mbn_18> brunoais: thx man, I was almost pulling my hair
[02:31:45] <brunoais> :)
[02:32:56] <Cork> mbn_18: you want :disabled
[02:33:04] <Cork> ?:disabled
[02:33:11] <Cork> <_<
[02:33:27] <Cork> sigh this bot is getting more and more useless by the day...
[02:33:44] <Cork> mbn_18: http://api.jquery.com/disabled-selector/
[02:34:00] <Cork> mbn_18: [disabled] will only check the attribute not the current state of the element
[02:34:28] <brunoais> Cork, to enable and disable is using the attribute
[02:34:39] <Cork> brunoais: no it isn't
[02:34:44] <brunoais> how do you disable an <input> or <button> without the disabled input?
[02:34:50] <brunoais> *attribute?
[02:34:56] <Cork> you use properties
[02:35:04] <Cork> attributes is used when the browser parses the html
[02:35:10] <Cork> it isn't used to control the state
[02:35:28] <brunoais> Node.disabled = true; <- Last time I saw, I changed the DOM
[02:35:39] <Cork> brunoais: yes and that is the property
[02:35:49] <brunoais> for buttons, inputs, etc...
[02:35:59] <brunoais> what is the alternative?
[02:36:02] <Cork> GAH
[02:36:15] <Cork> brunoais: please listen if you don't know the facts
[02:36:33] <Cork> i'm getting tired to have to over prove you of every freaking wrong statement you make
[02:36:52] <brunoais> sorry, sounds like I learned all those stuff wrong
[02:36:55] <Cork> brunoais: node.<anything> === property
[02:36:56] <brunoais> T.T
[02:37:04] <Cork> [] in a selector checks the attribute
[02:37:14] <Cork> attribute is what was in the html
[02:37:26] <Cork> property is the current internal value in the dom node
[02:37:42] <Cork> getAttribute() will give you the attribute
[02:37:50] <brunoais> as I said, it changes the Node in the DOM. It changes the rendered HTML
[02:37:58] <Cork> no
[02:38:07] <brunoais> O_O?
[02:38:10] <Cork> attribute and property isn't the same thing
[02:38:19] <Cork> and you don't render html you parse html to dom
[02:38:22] <brunoais> they aren't except for the ones specified as connected
[02:38:23] <Cork> dom is rendered
[02:38:33] <brunoais> yep
[02:38:41] <Cork> brunoais: attributes and properties is two completely separate things
[02:38:45] <brunoais> that's why I mentioned "rendered HTML" :S
[02:39:03] <brunoais> let me check on that, then. I need to be sure before I make a mistake like that again
[02:39:09] <Cork> ...
[02:39:24] <Cork> brunoais: fine, but please don't make statements in here unless you KNOW they are true
[02:39:31] <Cork> your hurting more then you help
[02:39:39] <Cork> and i'm tried of this constand time sink
[02:39:43] <brunoais> I was POSITIVE I was right T.T
[02:39:44] <Cork> *constant
[02:40:03] <brunoais> btw, about the thing I was proving to you
[02:40:05] <brunoais> did you see it?
[02:40:09] <brunoais> output before the alert?
[02:41:14] <Cork> brunoais: i could sit here poking holes in your arguments all days
[02:41:25] <Cork> but as i have better things to do no i won't
[02:41:43] <Cork> brunoais: make your own research
[02:42:04] <Cork> search engines will give you the answer if you look
[02:42:22] <brunoais> search engines say I'm right about DOMContentLoaded
[02:42:32] <Cork> sigh no they don't
[02:42:45] <Cork> and that is the last i will say on the subject
[02:42:55] <brunoais> give me an example pls
[02:42:59] <brunoais> I'm not convinced
[02:43:03] <Cork> i know
[02:43:06] <Cork> your never convinced
[02:44:39] <CrowX-> I have achieved animated growing of an object by using css transition on height and width. But how do I make the growing happen from the bottom-center upwards?
[02:45:26] <Cork> CrowX-: your animating height/width?
[02:45:34] <CrowX-> Cork, yes
[02:45:47] <CrowX-> I want the object to grow from the center bottom upwards
[02:45:50] <Cork> CrowX-: then you have to make the element position absolute and have a fixed parent to fix it to
[02:46:00] <Cork> CrowX-: else it will always be from top left
[02:46:12] <CrowX-> i'll try that
[02:46:19] <Cork> CrowX-: transform can do it with just if i remember correctly
[02:46:30] <Cork> *just css if
[02:46:37] <CrowX-> what's the difference between transform and transition?
[02:46:39] <CrowX-> in this case
[02:46:51] <Cork> transision is movment
[02:47:02] <Cork> transform is transforming the element
[02:47:05] <CrowX-> hmm, well I'm doing the animation just with css with transition too
[02:47:07] <Cork> (not moving)
[02:47:26] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-origin
[02:47:41] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform#scale
[02:49:49] <CrowX-> so, "transform:  scaleX(8%)" would do?
[02:50:07] <Cork> you need to specify the origin too
[02:50:12] <Cork> but ya
[02:51:20] <Cork> ex. transform-origin: 50% 100%; might be what you want
[02:51:35] <Cork> depending on how you want the width to scale
[02:52:10] <CrowX-> transform-origin is the starting size, and transform is the ending size?
[02:52:14] <brunoais> Cork, http://brunoaisserver.dtdns.net/NodeAttr%20vs%20property.html
[02:52:21] <brunoais> I was right all along!
[02:52:35] <Cork> CrowX-: no origin is how the element should move in relation to the real size of the element
[02:52:44] <Cork> brunoais: sigh no your not
[02:52:52] <brunoais> what is wrong in my test?
[02:53:12] <Cork> cause you have like always ignored what i explained
[02:53:37] <Cork> brunoais: i don't have time to throw away in this wheel
[02:53:53] <Cork> please just stop
[02:53:54] <brunoais> the object's attribute is linked to the rendered
[02:54:00] <brunoais> that's what is in the spec
[02:54:10] <brunoais> when I do querySelector() I gets the right one!
[02:54:26] <brunoais> all according to the one that is disabled
[02:59:21] <CrowX-> Cork, I'm not sure I get this. Where do I set the starting size?
[02:59:22] <seutje> should probably be using the disabled property instead of the attribute
[02:59:45] <Cork> seutje: that was the entire argument
[03:00:05] <seutje> oh, sry, I just woke up and clicked the first link I could find :P
[03:00:05] <Cork> CrowX-: transform isn't an animation
[03:00:16] <brunoais> Cork, is it this what you mean? http://brunoaisserver.dtdns.net/NodeAttr%20vs%20property.html
[03:00:25] <brunoais> I'm now confused on where does it fail
[03:00:28] <Cork> brunoais: please stop highlighting me or i will put you on ignore
[03:01:08] <Cork> CrowX-: what you do is is set the origin for where the scaled verson should be put in relation to the full size one
[03:01:11] <brunoais> hum...
[03:01:24] <Cork> CrowX-: after that you set scale(0) or what ever you like
[03:01:40] <Cork> CrowX-: then either with css transision or animate you animate it from 0 to 100%
[03:01:54] <Cork> scale is a scale of the real size
[03:02:03] <brunoais> cor|k, if you don't allow me to be teached, how can I learn?
[03:02:56] <Cork> brunoais: if you wanted to learn and not just argue hours on end the sure
[03:03:05] <Cork> that is the main reasons i'm here
[03:03:22] <Cork> *then sure
[03:03:30] <brunoais> just tell me where it fails so that I know it. if my test(v2) also wrong?
[03:03:38] <Cork> but when every question someone askes results in
[03:03:48] <Cork> you giving the wrong answer, i having to correct it
[03:04:00] <Cork> and after that argue with you about if for 20+ minutes
[03:04:11] <Cork> it makes it close to unmanagable to help in here
[03:04:38] <brunoais> :S
[03:06:24] <seutje> brunoais: if you can avoid touching dom, you should. And disabled elements shouldn't be matched on the attribute, but rather, the :disabled pseudo
[03:06:50] <brunoais> what's the actual difference ?
[03:06:57] <brunoais> why does it need the extra check?
[03:07:04] <brunoais> is it some browser bug I didn't explore?
[03:07:19] <brunoais> by the spec they must always match
[03:07:25] <CrowX-> Cork, here's what I have in css http://pastebin.com/kbS3RStv  the element at first has both the .element and .element-minimized class. With javascript I remove the .element-minimized class, so it would grow. but it still doesn't grow from the center... What am I doing wrong?
[03:07:45] <CrowX-> also chromium's inspect element shows the transform lines as invalid
[03:08:14] <Cork> CrowX-: in the minimized version you set scale to something like 0%
[03:08:24] <Cork> CrowX-: the origin can be in .element
[03:08:33] <Cork> CrowX-: in .element you then set scale to 100%
[03:09:00] <Cork> CrowX-: and width/height in .element should be the full size of the image
[03:09:06] <seutje> brunoais: so why are you passing in "disabled"
[03:09:15] <Cork> CrowX-: transform needs to be changed from width/height to transform
[03:09:22] <Cork> CrowX-: that's it, it should work
[03:09:37] <seutje> spec states you might as well pass in ' '
[03:09:52] <brunoais> seutje, It's xHTML
[03:09:59] <brunoais> but yes
[03:10:01] <seutje> WAT?
[03:10:12] <brunoais> yes, it's shtml
[03:10:15] <brunoais> *xhtml
[03:10:28] <seutje> it's allkindsof1990shtml it seems
[03:10:43] <seutje> what's an xhtml?
[03:11:10] <brunoais> It's a document that is written in html that follows XML rules
[03:11:19] <brunoais> you can also think in reverse
[03:12:21] <CrowX-> Cork, what do you mean by "<Cork> CrowX-: transform needs to be changed from width/height to transform"
[03:12:34] <Cork> CrowX-: GAH sorry typo
[03:12:35] <brunoais> seutje, I had forgotten the XML doctype
[03:12:37] <brunoais> it's now there
[03:12:51] <Cork> CrowX-: transition neds to be changed from width/height to transform
[03:13:00] <Sal_> hi
[03:13:11] <seutje> brunoais: lol MIME type!
[03:13:25] <seutje> brunoais: where's the CDATA?
[03:13:34] <Cork> CrowX-: meaning you need to tell transition to animate transform instead of width/height
[03:13:36] <Sal_> whats the best plugin for tap ans wipe events?
[03:13:42] <brunoais> seutje, CDATA for what?
[03:13:44] <Sal_> ans=and
[03:14:21] <seutje> brunoais: all the non-markup?
[03:14:51] <brunoais> seutje, no need
[03:14:58] <DarsVaeda> can anyone recommend a color picker that works with current jquery?
[03:15:01] <brunoais> I don't use reserved characters
[03:15:07] <DarsVaeda> is that even a valid question?
[03:15:16] <seutje> is there any reason you went with xml compliance? or just masochism?
[03:16:10] <seutje> wait wait, there's no need for CDATA wrapper around your non-markup, but you insist on putting meaningless content in an attribute because "it has to be XML compliant"?
[03:16:19] <seutje> Cork: ur right, this is making less sense by the minute!
[03:16:50] <brunoais> seutje, I'll make it go HTML, then
[03:17:10] <Cork> DarkGhost: it is kinda, but if you will get an answer is another question
[03:17:30] <Cork> DarkGhost: best option is prob to just search for all the different ones and set up a small testcase
[03:17:40] <CrowX-> Cork, I think I did that all and it still doesn't work http://pastebin.com/X93s9vN7 what have I done wrong?
[03:17:51] <seutje> brunoais: I don't care about your XML needs, threat an attribute like a property and sooner or later, you'll get some funky results from say... a link or something
[03:18:16] <Cork> CrowX-: wait you want it to be 8% of 8% width?
[03:18:22] <Cork> when it is at full size?
[03:18:23] <seutje> and I'm willing to bet that changing an attribute is more costly than a property
[03:18:35] <Cork> meaning if the window is 100px you would be 4px width?
[03:18:47] <CrowX-> Cork, I want it to be 8% of the container at full size
[03:18:55] <CrowX-> Cork, and 0 at start
[03:18:55] <brunoais> seutje, do you do that same thing for Node.id?
[03:18:58] <Cork> CrowX-: then you should set scale to 100%
[03:19:07] <Cork> CrowX-: as the width is 8%
[03:19:10] <DarsVaeda> Cork, ah okay it feels like I already tried all and none was working, but thanks :)
[03:19:21] <Cork> lol actually 8% of 8% != 4px >_<'
[03:19:56] <seutje> brunoais: what? why would you change IDs around?
[03:20:04] <seutje> can't recall ever having done that
[03:20:05] <Cork> CrowX-: currently if the parent is 100px your animating between 0px and 0.64px
[03:20:20] <seutje> except for some weirdo IE repaint bug where el.id = el.id; fixed it somehow
[03:20:27] <CrowX-> Cork, it doesn't animate the growth now. it just goes instantly to it
[03:20:37] <CrowX-> and inspect element shows the transition lines as crossed
[03:20:41] <CrowX-> invalid
[03:20:44] <Cork> CrowX-: scale is the scale it should be
[03:20:48] <brunoais> seutje, when I create elements. I use the Element.id, for example
[03:20:48] <Cork> not the width
[03:21:04] <Cork> your animating it to 8% of the width YOU WANT
[03:21:11] <Cork> not the 8% you want
[03:21:39] <Cork> CrowX-: at scale 100% you have the width and height of the element according to your element width value
[03:21:44] <CrowX-> Cork, http://i.imgur.com/YJ4E7sS.png
[03:21:44] <seutje> brunoais: sure, it doesn't matter for ID's, you should be targetting them with '#foo' anyway, not '[id="foo"]
[03:21:46] <brunoais> seutje, just please... tell me a situation where it fails
[03:21:58] <seutje> brunoais: grabbing the href from a link
[03:22:01] <CrowX-> Cork, the size is fine, the animation doesn't happen
[03:22:20] <CrowX-> the image is from chrome's inspect element
[03:22:30] <Cork> CrowX-: could you make a small jsfiddle about this?
[03:22:39] <brunoais> no, I mean a situation where ":disabled" does it right but a selector like "[disabled]" does it wrong
[03:22:41] <brunoais> I have no clue
[03:22:42] <Cork> CrowX-: cause that should work
[03:22:53] <AxonetBE> I use ajaxEnabled False for my jquery mobile and when I load a popup on pageinit it close automaticly when page is loaded, somebody knows how to fix this?
[03:23:41] <seutje> <a href="relative-uri"> <-- attribute: "relative-uri" , property will be an absolute URL with the entire path
[03:24:30] <CrowX-> ok
[03:24:35] <seutje> brunoais: it's not about failing or not. using 20000 slaves to build a pyramid works, but do we really want to be doing that?
[03:25:46] <brunoais> [disabled] uses the native querySelectorAll() (if available), ":disabled" does not (at least, until it is translated to the "[disabled]" if it ever is)
[03:25:52] <brunoais> what's what is in stake
[03:25:54] <seutje> WAT?
[03:25:57] <brunoais> *that's
[03:26:00] <seutje> `g css3 :disabled
[03:26:01] <b-ot> seutje: CSS3 :disabled Selector - W3Schools → http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_disabled.asp

[03:26:28] <Cork> CrowX-: btw you most likely want to use scale not scaleX
[03:27:01] <seutje> brunoais: it's both qSA, one is just more annoying to complete
[03:27:03] <brunoais> let me check
[03:27:10] <seutje> yeah, you do that
[03:29:15] <CrowX-> Cork, http://jsfiddle.net/sE9yB/
[03:29:26] <alaing> anyone here familiar with jQuery UI Widget Factory?
[03:29:36] <Cork> CrowX-: perfect one min
[03:29:47] <alaing> I 'm trying to work out the differences between _on and .on
[03:32:18] <Cork> ah right
[03:32:25] <Cork> webkit still have transform prefixed -_-'
[03:33:17] <Cork> CrowX-: http://jsfiddle.net/sE9yB/2/
[03:33:36] <CrowX-> Cork, beautiful
[03:33:48] <brunoais> Why didn't you give me a simple straight answer -_-'
[03:35:18] <d8bhatta> Hello Everybody
[03:35:24] <alaing> hi d8bhatta
[03:37:14] <brunoais> It's as simple as: 'You are wrong, ":disabled" works on all kinds of documents, "[disabled]" to find disabled elements, is only for HTML and ":disabled" is more future proof in case of HTML spec changes or elements where disabling is not by the existance of the "disabled" attribute.'
[03:37:23] <brunoais> -_-
[03:37:32] <brunoais> aaanyway...
[03:37:59] <brunoais> I've made enough mistakes here I better leave it for today
[03:38:25] <d8bhatta> I have to show pdf file in the pop up like lightbox
[03:38:35] <Mateo_> Hi !
[03:38:54] <Cork> d8bhatta: you need to use an iframe then
[03:39:02] <CrowX-> Cork, should I add -ms-transform for ie?
[03:39:11] <Cork> CrowX-: no need
[03:39:13] <CrowX-> also, what about -moz for older firefox?
[03:39:22] <Cork> CrowX-: webkit is the only engine that still uses prefixes
[03:39:29] <d8bhatta> cork , iframe is not good from SEO perspective
[03:39:54] <Cork> d8bhatta: then you can't embed a pdf
[03:40:11] <Cork> it's kinda an on off option :)
[03:40:20] <Cork> emded pdf => use iframe
[03:40:26] <Cork> don't want to use iframe => can't embed pdf
[03:40:53] <Cork> d8bhatta: you could try using <object> but it is basically the same thing
[03:40:54] <d8bhatta> cork: when I use embed without iframe,,,,pdf is shown in browser but pdf content is all zoomed in
[03:41:07] <Cork> d8bhatta: uh, what?
[03:41:17] <Cork> d8bhatta: you can't embed pdf at all without an iframe
[03:41:30] <Cork> if your not doing it your self then some lib is doing it for you
[03:41:53] <Cork> well except for the <object> option
[03:42:11] <d8bhatta> cork: I can see pdf text in browser wihtout ifram using embed/object
[03:42:33] <d8bhatta> the problem is the content of pdf doesn't look good
[03:42:39] <Cork> d8bhatta: without it being full page?
[03:43:21] <d8bhatta> yes without being full page....colorbox is used to show pop up...so pdf is shown   inside div
[03:43:35] <Cork> d8bhatta: then colorbox is adding the iframe for you
[03:43:54] <Cork> pdf isn't something you can "import" into a dom
[03:44:04] <Cork> so it is impossible to do normal rendering of it
[03:49:31] <d8bhatta> cork sorry for being late
[03:49:37] <Cork> np
[03:49:51] <d8bhatta> here is screenshot of the pdf that I am seeing in my browser without iframe
[03:49:52] <d8bhatta> http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=2pttik8&s=8#.U3nid1iSx58
[03:50:18] <d8bhatta> I have seearched iframe but its not found
[03:50:21] <Cork> d8bhatta: ya, but inspect the element creating the scrollbars
[03:50:41] <Cork> that will either be an <embed> <object> or <iframe>
[03:50:47] <Cork> *will be either
[03:50:59] <d8bhatta> it gives object
[03:51:08] <Cork> there you go
[03:51:20] <d8bhatta> ok..fine..
[03:51:36] <d8bhatta> but the problem is pdf content is not showing in its real size
[03:51:44] <d8bhatta> you can see the text in my image...its bigger
[03:51:55] <d8bhatta> where as in real its not like that..may be around 15px
[03:52:00] <Cork> d8bhatta: ya, you can't really control it
[03:52:17] <Cork> d8bhatta: it depends on what ever it is rendering the pdf (looks like chrome so pdf.js)
[03:52:54] <d8bhatta> so you are saying it is depended on browser?
[03:53:35] <Cork> yes
[03:53:47] <Cork> and sometimes even third party plugins
[03:53:56] <Cork> like adobe reader
[03:54:23] <Cork> or any of the other pdf embeding programs for windows/linux/mac and so on
[03:54:53] <Cork> d8bhatta: but firefox, chrome and (soon) opera is going to use pdf.js
[03:55:04] <Cork> not sure about ie actually
[03:56:08] <d8bhatta> ok..thank you so much for your time and reply.
[03:56:20] <Cork> np
[03:58:32] <CrowX-> is there a "mousemove start" event?
[03:58:36] <d8bhatta> cork: in between, one solution but not the best....open the pdf file using window.open ..
[03:58:50] <CrowX-> i.e. something that will be triggered only on the start of a mousemove,
[03:59:29] <Cork> CrowX-: no
[03:59:47] <Cork> CrowX-: as there isn't something to identifying it clearly
[03:59:52] <Cork> it is just a stream of events
[04:00:26] <CrowX-> k
[04:00:29] <Cork> touch-start exist cause that is a defined action (the finger touches the screen)
[04:09:52] <CrowX-> I have a single page site which is consisted of several divs each with height 100%, and body has overflow hidden. I navigate the site with .scrollTop and it's working fine. However
[04:10:16] <CrowX-> on browser resize, since all my divs' heights get changed, things get out of place
[04:10:37] <CrowX-> so I'm reruning .scrollTop on browser resize event
[04:10:42] <CrowX-> is there a better way of solving this?
[04:10:54] <Cork> CrowX-: ouch..
[04:10:57] <CrowX-> i.e. one without having to run .scrollTop on every resize
[04:11:12] <Cork> don't think so
[04:11:12] <CrowX-> what? :)
[04:11:38] <Cork> CrowX-: ouch was just that i understood the problem :)
[04:11:46] <CrowX-> :)
[04:12:38] <CrowX-> at least I successfully managed to get rid of TweenMax and do almost all animations via css
[04:13:06] <CrowX-> 96kb saved
[04:14:21] <Cork> CrowX-: nice
[04:15:04] <Cork> CrowX-: btw i was a bit unclear before
[04:15:24] <Cork> CrowX-: when i said "webkit is the only browser using prefixes" i meant for transform/transition
[04:15:44] <CrowX-> yeah, I understood
[04:17:01] <nodedfree> http://pastebin.com/A1SGPFVG
[04:17:18] <nodedfree> how do i release the closest?!
[04:17:30] <Cork> release?
[04:17:37] <nodedfree> i want to use $(tr + " td").hide();
[04:17:42] <Cork> you can't
[04:17:45] <nodedfree> i get error that this is an object
[04:17:47] <nodedfree> why
[04:17:50] <Cork> tr is a dom element you can't concat that to a string
[04:18:09] <nodedfree> how can i touch the tr / td?
[04:18:13] <Cork> tr.find('td:eq(0)') is prob what you want
[04:18:31] <Cork> or just tr.children().first()
[04:18:36] <nodedfree> ok. the main idea is to make an $.each for the td's
[04:18:52] <Cork> tr.children.each(
[04:18:55] <Cork> bah
[04:18:57] <Cork> tr.children().each(
[04:19:18] <nodedfree> children gives me the whole td's i understand right?
[04:19:35] <Cork> the only element that can be a child of tr is td and th
[04:19:49] <nodedfree> ok
[04:19:51] <Cork> so it will give you those in an array
[04:19:58] <Cork> and .each will loop them
[04:20:11] <nodedfree> ok thanks. i will try now
[04:20:44] <nodedfree> the error i got before was: unrecognized expression: [object Object]td:eq(0)
[04:20:50] <Cork> ya
[04:20:56] <brunoais> CrowX-, may I try to propose a way?
[04:20:57] <Cork> cause you used a jquery object + string
[04:21:04] <nodedfree> so i almost throw the computer from 11 floor
[04:21:21] <Cork> and the object in tr gets convert to '[object Object]'
[04:21:45] <nodedfree> yes now everything seems right.. the object object is the 'tr td'
[04:22:08] <Cork> nodedfree: not really, but ya close enough :)
[04:22:51] <CrowX-> brunoais, sure
[04:23:33] <brunoais> CrowX-, just to make sure I understand the page HTML + CSS organization. Do you have an onlive version of it?
[04:26:07] <CrowX-> brunoais, I'll upload in a sec
[04:26:10] <brunoais> ok
[04:26:34] <CrowX-> just a sec, i'm changing an element, it will take a 2-3 minutes.
[04:30:50] <brunoais> CrowX-, is it ok if I go and grab lunch now and I try to help you later?
[04:31:00] <brunoais> I mean, right after lunch?
[04:32:32] <CrowX-> brunoais, sure
[04:32:44] <brunoais> brb
[04:33:23] <nodedfree> Cork, http://pastebin.com/vWLuFpVJ i get empty values, but it count the right number of the td's
[04:33:34] <nodedfree> and be sure there is an text on each td
[04:33:59] <Cork> nodedfree: could you make a demo instead of code dump?
[04:34:07] <Cork> jsfiddle.net or jsbin.com
[04:34:28] <nodedfree> it's exploded on many files @_@
[04:34:46] <nodedfree> the .find('td:eq(0)').text() works
[04:34:52] <nodedfree> for an individual
[04:35:43] <Cork> nodedfree: you could try doing something like console.log(tr.html());
[04:35:52] <nodedfree> yes sec
[04:35:56] <Cork> and see if it is really there
[04:36:13] <nodedfree> i get 10 values of 'underfined'
[04:36:16] <Cork> as long as you've found the tr .children() should work just ine
[04:36:21] <Cork> *fine
[04:36:36] <nodedfree> there is the problem
[04:36:47] <nodedfree> i think children() it's not what i need

[04:38:40] <bberry> I have a <div> that i need centered vertically and horizontally. the div must keep its original form, which is to be able to dynamically adjust its width, and have its elements be ordered in a 'list-like' fashion. http://jsfiddle.net/cjLHt/21/ have at it!
[04:38:52] <bberry> the way i accomplished this before was to put the contents inside of a <table>.  But i've been told to not use tables for layout purposes. but i honestly cant figure out how to do this otherwise.

[04:41:57] <nodedfree> the index was missing?
[04:42:01] <bberry> lol yeah.
[04:42:10] <Cork> nodedfree: or just use this
[04:42:23] <Cork> no need for the arguments http://jsfiddle.net/9TTrJ/2/
[04:42:26] <nodedfree> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
[04:42:28] <bberry> but yes, theres probably a better way to do it
[04:42:32] <nodedfree> bberry, i do
[04:42:44] <nodedfree> if you want to marry
[04:42:50] <Cork> nodedfree: also, DEFINE YOUR VARIABLES!!!!!!!
[04:43:05] <nodedfree> how
[04:43:13] <Cork> var tr = <value>;
[04:43:20] <bberry> hahaha
[04:43:43] <nodedfree> Cork, ok. and thank you both
[04:43:46] <bberry> np np :D
[04:43:50] <Cork> ^^
[04:44:53] <bberry> Cork, isnt that exact center thing only going to work if the dementions are going to be statically defined?
[04:45:13] <Cork> bberry: to some degree yes
[04:45:33] <bberry> i think im just going to use a table like i had originally
[04:45:34] <Cork> bberry: but that is the limitation of css pre flex
[04:45:37] <bberry> yeah
[04:46:08] <Cork> bberry: basically "share x with y" doesn't exist in css
[04:46:11] <Cork> pre flex
[04:46:18] <Cork> and that is what you need
[04:46:27] <bberry> yeah
[04:46:32] <bberry> imma just use tables. haha
[04:46:47] <Cork> bberry: depends on what browser compatibility you need
[04:46:48] <abishek> why does $.extend split the characters to array when I pass it as config to a plugin as a string?
[04:46:53] <Cork> all modern browsers support flex
[04:46:59] <bberry> yeah, i need ie8+
[04:47:05] <bberry> so probably cant do flex :/
[04:47:10] <bberry> bc ie8 is balls
[04:47:21] <Cork> abishek: cause $.extend is meant for arrays and objects
[04:47:33] <Cork> abishek: and if you loop a string you take it variables per variable
[04:47:36] <Cork> uh...
[04:47:38] <Cork> *character
[04:47:48] <Cork> bberry: ouch the ya
[04:47:51] <slax0r> Cork: do you know php array_merge_recursive? if you do, is $.extend the same as array_merge_recursive, that it merges all array elements between two arrays? plus objects in javascript?
[04:47:52] <Cork> *then
[04:48:09] <Cork> slax0r: yes and no :)
[04:48:19] <slax0r> yes you know, and no it's not?
[04:48:25] <Cork> $.extend(true,...) does
[04:48:35] <Cork> it is both
[04:48:40] <slax0r> oh
[04:48:58] <Cork> slax0r: hmm
[04:49:07] <Cork> but i'm not sure it will merge the arrays correctly
[04:49:17] <abishek> Cork, I was trying to accept options for a Jquery Plugin I am creating and I am following this http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/#accepting-options. If you look at this section, the value orange is being passed. I am doing something similar for my plugin, but orange gets split as array
[04:49:19] <Cork> i have a vague memory of it messing that up
[04:50:10] <slax0r> Cork: what would you then suggest, if I have a nested array, and the deepest array has some nested objects, and I need to merge this whole mess?
[04:50:16] <Cork> abishek: most likely cause your not doing the object around the string
[04:51:44] <Cork> slax0r: ya, just tested
[04:51:49] <Cork> $.extend({ a:[1,2,3] }, { a:[4,5,6] }).a == [4,5,6]
[04:52:12] <slax0r> it overwrites same "keys"?
[04:52:12] <Cork> slax0r: you prob have to either find a plugin, or extend extend ;)
[04:52:17] <Cork> ya
[04:52:30] <slax0r> I heard you like extend, so we put an extend on your extend? ;)
[04:52:46] <Cork> heh
[04:52:56] <slax0r> overwrites, I do not mind, because I have to overwrite them :)
[04:53:01] <slax0r> maybe merge was the wrong word :)
[04:53:28] <Cork> in that case, yes it was ^^
[04:54:46] <slax0r> anyway, if anyone is using sublime, is there a nice plugin that will properly tab a javascript file? I can't get my co-worker to indent it properly and I'm getting sick of it
[04:56:55] <Cork> slax0r: i've seen tidy plugins for many languages, but not js
[04:57:12] <abishek> Cork, this is what I have http://jsbin.com/muqis/2/edit?html,js,console
[04:57:33] <slax0r> yeah, js is like that fat kid, who never gets picked, when it comes down to such plugins :/
[04:57:42] <bberry> slax0r: what i do is align all the lines to the left side and do edit->line->reindent.
[04:57:49] <slax0r> would jslint tidy up the code?
[04:57:49] <bberry> but that only works if no comments are in the code
[04:57:59] <slax0r> bberry: not useful then :)
[04:58:01] <bberry> yeah
[04:58:04] <bberry> its kinda shitty
[04:58:15] <Cork> abishek: $.extend({}, $.fn.MyPlugin.defaults.ele, options.ele); <--
[04:58:42] <bberry> i feel like itd be a relatively easy problem to solve for sublime... but obviously it is more complicated that it seems... :/
[04:58:55] <Cork> abishek: also that line doesn't make sense
[04:59:22] <Cork> slax0r: yes it would
[04:59:28] <abishek> Cork, what I am trying to do is to override the value of ele from what is set on the default
[04:59:33] <Cork> slax0r: jsfiddles tidy works quite well actually
[04:59:54] <slax0r> Cork: will give it a shot, thanks!
[04:59:57] <Cork> abishek: so options.ele = ele ?
[05:00:12] <bberry> does jsfiddle use 3 or 4 spaces
[05:00:22] <Cork> try it?
[05:00:26] <slax0r> 3? o.O
[05:00:31] <slax0r> I've seen 2, but 3?
[05:00:42] <bberry> jsfiddle uses 4
[05:00:45] <Cork> slax0r: i usually use tree :)
[05:00:47] <bberry> i use 3
[05:01:02] <bberry> 2 is too close, 4 is too far
[05:01:02] <Cork> or rather i use tab with that size
[05:01:04] <slax0r> really? :O
[05:01:04] <bberry> for me
[05:01:12] <abishek> Cork, ok, let me give that a try
[05:01:14] <slax0r> we've been using 4 for ages
[05:01:19] <slax0r> 2 for bash scripts
[05:01:24] <slax0r> and sass
[05:05:30] * rindolf uses 4 for everything.
[05:05:37] <bberry> i've somehow convinced all my coworkers to use 3 now
[05:05:50] <bberry> so nice to have everyone on the same page
[05:06:17] <banister> hi, is thre a way i can avoid doing: aPromise.done((obj)=>func(obj))    so that i can just have the 'func' in there by itself without having to wrap it in an anonymous function?
[05:07:17] <Cork> bandroidx: uh... that i ecma.next
[05:07:23] <Cork> *banister:
[05:07:33] <banister> Cork oh, i thik i just pass done(func)
[05:07:34] <banister> heh heh
[05:07:36] <Cork> and yes you don't need to wrap a function like that
[05:07:57] <Cork> banister: exactly
[05:08:05] <banister> sorry, ruby-adled brain :)
[05:09:04] <slax0r> bberry: in a team you don't need to "convince" anyone, the team has to define the standards, and everyone must follow them
[05:09:46] <bberry> agreed. that sounded a lot like what i said to convince everyone
[05:09:59] <bberry> lol
[05:11:19] <bberry> actually what happens is that most of our projects are solo projects. it wasnt until recently that we all started working on the same one.
[05:11:23] <bberry> happened*
[05:13:41] <bberry> Anyway. so I have a table. inside theres a bunch of <tr> with 3 <td>. the three <td>'s are a label, a text input, and a span.  I have a 'input' event handler on the text input. i need to select the span and change the spans innerHTML. this is one way to do it... $(this).parent().next('td').children()[0] but i dont think its very clean.  Is there a better way?
[05:15:01] <seutje> $(this).closest('tr').find('span') ?
[05:15:33] <bberry> ah thats probably better. let me read up on how closest works.
[05:15:44] <seutje> "go up untill you find it"
[05:15:49] <decx> but that's not the same
[05:15:54] <seutje> basically first parent
[05:16:16] <seutje> if there's no other span in the row, it seems silly to be more specific
[05:17:10] <decx> oh there's one in each td
[05:17:58] <seutje> $(this).closest('tr').find('span').last()? :P
[05:18:02] <bberry> theres 3 <td>s, the first contains a label, the 2nd contains a text input, the 3rd contains a span
[05:18:09] <bberry> haha
[05:37:58] <brunoais> CrowX-, I'm back
[05:38:03] <brunoais> sorry about the delay
[05:38:23] <CrowX-> brunoais, check pvt
[05:47:00] <banister> is there something like ruby's each_with_object for underscore.js ?
[06:08:14] <Cork> banister: 1. you're asking in jquery so wrong channel, 2. you're better of asking for how you do something instead of a function similar to another language
[06:08:38] <Cork> banister: cause there might be better ways to do the same thing in the other language
[06:14:06] <noregret_> https://github.com/andyvr/picEdit - anybody using this?
[06:15:58] <decx> how is an indescript set of icons in a rectangle more userfriendly than a button that says 'choose file' ?
[06:16:36] <Cork> decx: you can fit more of them in the same area?
[06:16:43] <Cork> i donno but it is "modern"
[06:16:43] <noregret_> decx: was that for me ?
[06:17:14] <decx> no directly
[06:17:17] <decx> i'm just wondering
[06:17:21] <decx> not directly*
[06:17:49] <noregret_> well, that plugin edits the image beforoe upload...
[06:17:57] <kraftman> i guess because it acts normally if you click the left image, u can drag and drop files, or take a picture directly
[06:18:22] <kraftman> its slightly less obvious in one sense but allows two useful methods of adding images
[06:18:25] <decx> ah i see, you can capture from webcam and it's not just a dragarea as i suspected
[06:18:41] <noregret_> editing the pic is what concerns me the most, not its design..
[06:19:15] <decx> carry on then ^^
[06:21:42] <noregret_> well, i was asking because i need a lil bit of help =)
[06:21:51] <noregret_> if anyone is using it ie
[06:25:54] <dmoreno> Hey guys.
[06:27:00] <dmoreno> I need to know, What I need to do to convert pixels to points on jquery.
[06:27:43] <Cork> dmoreno: points?
[06:28:19] <dmoreno> Yes, points
[06:28:49] <noregret_> you mean with coordinates ?
[06:28:56] <dmoreno> I have a dimension in px and I need pt.
[06:29:09] <Cork> dmoreno: ah
[06:29:27] <Cork> there is no built in function neither in jquery or js for that conversion
[06:30:21] <Cork> dmoreno: http://www.itjungles.com/point-to-pixel-conversion.html
[06:42:07] <noregret_> is there some callback i can use to catch anything thrown from the server? without it being linked to something... not sure if makes sense..
[06:43:06] <seutje> you can set a global ajaxSuccess handler, but that only works for those initialized by jQuery
[06:43:32] <noregret_> seutje: ah, that might work, how can I do that ?
[06:43:43] <seutje> `api ajaxoptions
[06:43:43] <b-ot> seutje: No matches.
[06:43:47] <seutje> bastard!
[06:43:53] <noregret_> =)
[06:44:17] <seutje> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajaxSetup/ that's the one!
[06:44:41] <dmoreno> I'm using C# on serve side
[06:54:44] <noregret_> seutje: http://bpaste.net/show/HHPIgorgeXL0LUCSsn54/ - is this the right syntax? because it is not triggering for me
[06:57:26] <seutje> noregret_: I think it's "complete"
[06:58:10] <seutje> (opposed to success/error)
[07:00:03] <noregret_> seutje: ah, seems it won't work out, as the plugin is initiating calls thru xmlhttprequest directly, and not jquery
[07:00:11] <noregret_> :/
[07:00:28] <seutje> ah yeah... the power of a plugin framework... lost :P
[07:02:24] <noregret_> seutje: =) any idea of a more friendly plugin that does the same as https://github.com/andyvr/picEdit ?
[07:04:07] <seutje> noregret_: don't see any license being mentioned... might get away with forking it and making it more flexible, might even get pulled!
[07:05:53] <skullcrasher> http://pastie.org/9189716
[07:06:05] <skullcrasher> can anyone tell my, why the second log is never executet?
[07:07:32] <rindolf> skullcrasher: let me see.
[07:07:36] <decx> it is
[07:08:43] <skullcrasher> rly?
[07:08:50] <skullcrasher> for me only the log(1) works
[07:08:55] <skullcrasher> the 2nd never appears in log
[07:09:02] <decx> yes http://jsfiddle.net/decx/Ru4VZ/
[07:09:57] <skullcrasher> wtf
[07:13:10] <skullcrasher> well ok, then it must be something else -.-
[07:13:24] <skullcrasher> jsfiddle works here on local machine only first one is logged
[07:16:55] <Ryu_Fitzgerald> where can I see how the .load function works?
[07:17:10] <Ryu_Fitzgerald> the internal code of it basically
[07:17:37] <Wolf_22> I'm trying to apply style to links in an OL based on whether or not their parsed title values match a numeric found in a set of TDs... Any ideas why it's not working? http://jsfiddle.net/gpcLH/
[07:18:05] <Sal> does anyone have a good solution for mouseleave event not firing when house goes out of browser?
[07:18:34] <Sal> i'm trying to resolve using a timer, but seems to not work well
[07:30:10] <decx> isn't that mouseout Sal ?
[07:30:35] <Sal> you mean i should use mouse out instead of mouseleave?
[07:30:59] <decx> well i know mouseout works for this, but i also remember using mouseleave sooo
[07:31:07] <decx> just try
[07:31:07] <Sal> i have a div that is set left:0
[07:31:40] <Sal> when you move the mouse to the left of browser, going out of browser, mouseleave doesn't fire
[07:32:02] <Sal> ok, i was using hover that is a shurtcut for enter-leave
[07:32:19] <Sal> i'l separate the 2 in mouseenter and mouseout
[07:34:52] <Sal> decx, not working
[07:35:29] <decx> demo it
[07:35:33] <Sal> its hard to build a sample on jsfiddle because its impossible to draw a div near the browser sice
[07:35:34] <Sal> side
[07:36:05] <Sal> there are always a couple of pixels before leaving the browser, so the event always fires there
[07:37:43] <decx> Wolf_22 right in that context is a native element, you have to wrap it in $() to apply .css()
[07:38:46] <Wolf_22> decx: Good catch. :)
[07:39:58] <Sal> decx, is there any other online js pasting site wher the output panel is touching the browser side without any pixels between?
[07:40:15] <decx> add /show to your fiddle Sal
[07:40:30] <Sal> oh, ok
[07:40:35] <Sal> didn't know that
[07:41:44] <nodedfree> i want to make an array that created with someArray['someIndex'] = 'someValue' to json, but i get an error
[07:42:05] <nodedfree> JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(someArray)) <- doesnt work
[07:42:30] <BillCriswell> nodedfree: Don't you just want someArray ?
[07:42:48] <nodedfree> and what is the "__proto__" that poped into the array
[07:43:01] <nodedfree> BillCriswell, i need json for php
[07:44:14] <BillCriswell> nodedfree: Are you sue someArray is cool?
[07:44:37] <nodedfree> BillCriswell, yes, i see everything on the console
[07:45:06] <BillCriswell> nodedfree: http://jsbin.com/vozuh/1/edit?js this test works as I'd expect.
[07:45:12] <decx> Wolf_22 you'd be better off using indexOf to compare to an array
[07:45:41] <decx> Wolf_22 http://jsfiddle.net/decx/gpcLH/1/
[07:45:56] <decx> wait now i broke something :>
[07:46:02] <BillCriswell> Way to do decx.
[07:46:05] <BillCriswell> Way to go*
[07:46:22] <decx> oh right http://jsfiddle.net/decx/gpcLH/2/
[07:46:26] <decx> Wolf_22 ^^
[07:46:53] <nodedfree> BillCriswell, you did from json to array, i need the opposite
[07:46:54] <Wolf_22> decx: You are awesome. I knew there had to be a better way to traverse those arrays than what I had.
[07:47:20] <Wolf_22> decx: Traverse those "elements", I should say. Thanks again!
[07:47:38] <BillCriswell> nodedfree: Paste your code on jsbin. I'm having a hard time following you.
[07:49:55] <BillCriswell> Nice, there's a third pararameter on stringify that'll pretty pring.
[07:49:57] <BillCriswell> print*
[07:50:27] <nodedfree> BillCriswell,  http://pastebin.com/FzKTCVXX
[07:52:47] <BillCriswell> nodedfree: Ok, you might want to step back and approach this differently.
[07:55:12] <BillCriswell> nodedfree: When you do var updateString = new Array(); and do like.... updateString[5] = {...} you're creating an array like... [undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, undefined, {...}] which I doubt you want.
[07:56:07] <nodedfree> wait
[07:56:54] <nodedfree> BillCriswell,  so what is the way i need to approach this
[07:57:17] <nodedfree> isn't it okay to have array['name'], array['last'] for example?
[07:57:39] <decx> doesnt look like array to me
[07:58:16] <nodedfree> so? (i'm a totally php guy)
[07:58:21] <BillCriswell> nodedfree: Nope.
[07:58:34] <BillCriswell> nodedfree: Why do you want the id of the element instead of the name?
[07:58:44] <decx> is there a difference between this.style.background = 'blue' and this.style.backgroundColor = 'blue'
[07:58:56] <BillCriswell> decx: The way you prefer is probably wrong.
[07:58:58] <nodedfree> because, on the server side i handle the same parameters
[07:59:08] <decx> so nothing unusual then
[07:59:09] <nodedfree> $array['name']
[07:59:18] <BillCriswell> decx: Story of my life.
[07:59:20] <decx> decx.prototype.hipster
[07:59:44] <decx> i thought there was some ie shenanigans
[07:59:50] <BillCriswell> nodedfree: There's .serializeArray() that'll generate an object you can pass through $.post, $.get or whatever to set it properly in PHP
[08:00:16] <BillCriswell> nodedfree: The only thing is that uses the name attribute and not the id.
[08:00:50] <skullcrasher> still the same :/
[08:01:01] <skullcrasher> on my local machine the this.each is not executed
[08:01:56] <BillCriswell> Not sure why the id would needed for sending it to PHP.
[08:02:15] <skullcrasher> http://jsfiddle.net/K3Dz8/
[08:02:21] <skullcrasher> i don't get why :/
[08:02:26] <skullcrasher> on jsfiddle it works
[08:02:40] <decx> it's return.each
[08:02:43] <decx> not this each
[08:03:32] <BillCriswell> Isn't this a jquery object already?
[08:03:59] <nodedfree> BillCriswell, what is the other way to gather all the variables into one array? (vua jquery)
[08:04:04] <nodedfree> via
[08:04:07] <skullcrasher> the plugin docs say return this.each
[08:04:11] <BillCriswell> so like: return this.each(function() { ... });  would do the trick?
[08:04:32] <decx> shouldnt make a difference
[08:04:37] <BillCriswell> nodedfree: .serializeArray() or .serialize()
[08:04:56] <decx> i bet there's something else
[08:05:00] <BillCriswell> Either way would send the data to PHP the same way a form would.
[08:05:08] <BillCriswell> What is the issue with the code?
[08:05:11] <skullcrasher> BillCriswell: already hat that. and as i said on jsfiddle it works fine
[08:05:20] <skullcrasher> *had
[08:05:57] <BillCriswell> skullcrasher: Oh, so there's a bunch of other code that could be interfering with this but you're not sharing?
[08:06:15] <BillCriswell> I could see how we should be able to help. =p
[08:06:34] <skullcrasher> thought that too, so i commented all other stuff out
[08:06:37] <decx> skullcrasher i can recreate that if if put the script in the head without wrapper
[08:06:38] <skullcrasher> still the same ..
[08:06:50] <decx> like here http://jsfiddle.net/decx/K3Dz8/1/
[08:07:13] <decx> so you're just doing it wrong and i blame all the problems on the world on you
[08:07:25] <skullcrasher> :P
[08:07:38] <skullcrasher> decx: wow that looks exactly like here
[08:07:58] <decx> so you have it in the head without doc ready wrapper or window.onload
[08:08:24] <skullcrasher> ok, I will look into this
[08:08:27] <skullcrasher> thx
[08:08:33] <decx> because when you run that script there won't be any elements in the document
[08:08:41] <Sal> decx, http://jsfiddle.net/8yyV8/show/
[08:09:09] <Sal> see what i mean?
[08:09:12] <skullcrasher> decx: could be a problem with the loading via the framework i use
[08:09:26] <Sal> when you go out of the broswer at its left side, the color doesn't go back to red
[08:09:37] <decx> yeah it does

[08:12:17] <decx> BillCriswell you were right, dinosaurs is still amazing
[08:12:38] <decx> same in chrome for me
[08:12:40] <BillCriswell> decx: Haha.
[08:12:57] <BillCriswell> I love when Earl talks to Richfield.
[08:13:01] <decx> it's so sharp and clever. i feel sorry for kids today
[08:14:42] <decx> not to mention the amazing art direction and technical marvel of animatronics
[08:15:39] <BillCriswell> decx: Yeah, three people working as one. True talent.
[08:16:20] <Sal> decx, http://i.imgur.com/mJ8nLbB.gif
[08:16:53] <decx> mac?
[08:16:59] <Sal> nop
[08:17:49] <skullcrasher> ok, call me the dumbest person ...
[08:18:00] <decx> well i'm on windows and it's as expected in ff,chrome,safari
[08:18:15] <Sal> decx, then what could it be?
[08:18:18] <decx> too late skullcrasher ^^
[08:18:40] <Sal> if i move the mouse slowly, its not changing?
[08:18:54] <Sal> but i noticed, that if i move it fast, sometimes it does
[08:19:04] <decx> no idea Sal
[08:19:27] <Sal> what about using a timer?
[08:19:29] <decx> i'd blame an uninvolved cultural minority, but then again, i'm german so yeah
[08:19:40] <Sal> is there a way to know it the cursor is on an item?
[08:19:55] <Sal> like maybe checking cursor position and items offset?
[08:20:01] <decx> that's ridiculous
[08:20:17] <decx> maybe get input from more people
[08:20:30] <decx> if anyone else but you can replicate that
[08:21:18] <Sal> ok, for now, i'll give up
[08:21:45] <Sal> i just wanted to show 20 pixels of a left hidden panel when mouse was over the browsers left side
[08:21:52] <Sal> but this seems impossible to do
[08:22:15] <decx> what like a hidden bar?
[08:22:25] <Sal> yes, a hidden menu
[08:22:27] <decx> with icons on it
[08:22:35] <decx> there should be no need for js at all
[08:22:44] <Sal> thats could out a little just like the android hidden menus when you tap on the side of the screen
[08:23:01] <BillCriswell> Sal: Is there anything "under" said bar?
[08:23:25] <BillCriswell> Like if there was an element just taking up a little bit of the left of the screen would that be ok?
[08:24:02] <Sal> BillCriswell, i have this : <body><div class"panel"><div class="content"></div></div>
[08:24:07] <decx> so you want to use hover, which doesn't exist on touch. to recreate something from a touch interface? somehow that's funny :>
[08:24:19] <Sal> and the event is for .panel
[08:24:54] <Sal> i have panel out of left side for 20px and content right-margin set to 20px
[08:25:01] <Sal> so you don't see the panel
[08:25:14] <Sal> when mouse over, content right-matgin goes to 0
[08:25:19] <Sal> so you see it for 20px
[08:25:53] <Sal> decx, on mobile, i already have libraries that do it good
[08:26:10] <Sal> i just want to do it on desktop
[08:26:26] <forgotmynick> How do I change the img URL using jquery? <a class="btn_facebook" href="http://example.com"><img src="//example.com/image.png"></a>
[08:26:31] <Sal> there are slidr amd swiper
[08:28:45] <decx> $('img','.btn_facebook').prop('src',newurl)
[08:29:24] <decx> but these libs have desktop functionality already don'T they Sal ?
[08:30:32] <Sal> slidr enters panels on click or buy code. noway to slide them in by mousedrag
[08:30:40] <haleys> I’m trying to find the trigger of the bootstrap modal. I followed this solution on stack exchange: http://cl.ly/image/1Z3i0t1P1s2t - but when I console.log $invoker I see this: http://cl.ly/image/0E3U0F2a2s2T - It doesn’t actually give me the trigger dom element. Any ideas?
[08:31:17] <Sal> swiper, drages in panel, like i want, but first i needto show at leat 20 pixels of it
[08:31:24] <Sal> and thats what i was trying to so
[08:31:39] <Sal> simply, show 20px pf the panel so it could be swiped in
[08:32:30] <Sal> anyway, i have to find another solution or go for the stupid icon click to open
[08:32:49] <Sal> because if it works on some and doesn't on others, then its not the right solution
[08:33:41] <Sal> i regret flash when these things happen
[08:34:48] <BillCriswell> Man, CSS is awesome.
[08:35:37] <BillCriswell> nowadays, at least.
[08:35:55] <tw2113> CSS: easy to learn, difficult to master
[08:36:32] <BillCriswell> tw2113: Definitely.
[08:37:07] <decx> i mastered css like 10 years ago
[08:37:11] <decx> but they keep adding stuff :(
[08:38:06] <tw2113> like the aholes they are :P
[08:38:13] <BillCriswell> This would have taken hours to do with JS years ago (for me atleast), with CSS it's like 10 minutes: http://jsbin.com/pofaj/1/edit?html,css,output
[08:39:24] <BillCriswell> Chrome is really weird with the border on that.
[08:39:33] <BillCriswell> Small screens it like hides a side randomly.
[08:39:33] <decx> well too bad 30% of itnernetusers can't rely on hover ^^
[08:39:40] <BillCriswell> decx: Indeed.
[08:40:48] <BillCriswell> I really like hover events too, it sucks.
[08:41:13] <decx> yeah trying to normalize touch and mouse is a bitch
[08:41:18] <Uhkis> scumbag mobile devices
[08:42:31] <BillCriswell> "Fuck hover and replace this very sharp mouse with your fat ass, round fingers"
[08:43:02] <haleys> This may be more of a JavaScript question, but how would I select target: in this console.log? http://cl.ly/image/2S1s0e1u0E3V
[08:43:25] <decx> .target
[08:43:52] <haleys> decx: Awesome. Thanks! I thought I had to get through the 0 index first
[08:44:05] <decx> probably
[08:44:14] <BillCriswell> haleys: Where is that coming from?
[08:44:48] <BillCriswell> whatever[0].target should get it, if you want to select it with jQuery you'd need to do like $(whatever[0].target)
[08:44:56] <haleys> A console.log: http://cl.ly/image/2s2c2a0K0z1Y - trying to find the invoker/trigger of a bootstrap modal box
[08:45:35] <BillCriswell> haleys: Ah, you can use the event object for that.
[08:46:04] <BillCriswell> Actually... what is wrong with e.relatedTarget you have commented out?
[08:46:41] <haleys> BillCriswell: When I did that, it console.logged to this: http://cl.ly/image/0E3U0F2a2s2T - couldn’t find the invoker in this. looked generic
[08:47:03] <decx> what's with the screens, demo that shit
[08:48:29] <BillCriswell> Doesn't look like an event object.
[08:49:52] <haleys> BillCriswell: That’s what I was thinking. I”m using Bootstrap 3, which that was suppose to be fixed.
[08:53:56] <BillCriswell> haleys: http://jsbin.com/wurih/1/edit?html,output this has bootstrap and shit ready to go if you want to set up a demo
[08:54:06] <BillCriswell> I need pizza though, brb.
[09:01:07] <madalin> Can anyone tell me how i could read php serialized data into jquery ?
[09:01:28] <duch_kazatel> madalin have an endpoint that responds with just JSON and then parse it.
[09:01:50] <madalin> got some documentation about that ?
[09:02:08] <haleys> madalin: jQuery AJAX http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax
[09:02:32] <duch_kazatel> there's probably a lib out there for outputting JSON.
[09:02:44] <duch_kazatel> not sure waht you mean by "php serialized data"
[09:03:43] <effortDee> hey guys, how can i make this run sideways/horizonatally on a web page rather than vertically? http://jsfiddle.net/yjYJ4/
[09:03:49] <madalin> duch_kazatel: http://us.php.net/serialize
[09:04:11] <duch_kazatel> effortDee see the bit about $(this).animate({scrollTop: 0} ?
[09:04:18] <haleys> duch_kazatel: Why not use php’s json_encode()?
[09:04:30] <duch_kazatel> madalin i know nothing about PHP btw ;)
[09:04:44] <decx> you can scroll horizontally but it's not exactly nice effortDee
[09:04:44] <effortDee> yes duch_kazatel
[09:04:50] <tw2113> what kind of web developer are you duch_kazatel ???
[09:04:53] <duch_kazatel> effortDee and the line before that?  you want to edit those.
[09:05:00] <duch_kazatel> tw2113 the kind who works in other languages ;)
[09:05:11] <tw2113> freak! freak! jk
[09:05:14] <duch_kazatel> :)
[09:05:23] <effortDee> ty
[09:05:35] <duch_kazatel> effortDee but it's not going to look very nice.
[09:05:46] <duch_kazatel> you'll also need to edit your CSS to get your text to wrap width-wise.
[09:06:08] <effortDee> so i edit .height to .width
[09:06:20] <effortDee> and scrollTop to ?
[09:06:49] <duch_kazatel> you also need to add CSS to set it to be wider
[09:06:56] <effortDee> i've done that :)
[09:07:24] <effortDee> scrollTop > scrollRight ?
[09:07:50] <Es0teric> how do you grab content from a text area on submit before it posts to the db?
[09:08:25] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric by preventing the submit, grabbing it, then letting it continue, unless it's AJAx in which case you just save that data in the submit handler.
[09:08:38] <effortDee> duch_kazatel i can't take this any further D: thanks for your help
[09:08:49] <duch_kazatel> effortDee huh?  you can figure it out.
[09:08:57] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ok so if i prevent the submit and grab it, how do i let it continue?
[09:09:04] <effortDee> im trying :D
[09:09:27] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you don't "let it continue" - preventing the submit means you have to then do the submit yourself.  is this via ajax?
[09:09:36] <duch_kazatel> effortDee show me what you have so far.
[09:09:40] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel no, not ajax
[09:09:46] <effortDee> http://jsfiddle.net/HEMLA/
[09:10:02] <duch_kazatel> effortDee not scrollRight
[09:10:17] <duch_kazatel> effortDee do you have your console open?
[09:10:21] <effortDee> yes
[09:10:29] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric then you need to manually trigger the submit.
[09:10:44] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel infact, how do i grab content from a $_POST ?
[09:10:45] <duch_kazatel> effortDee so then you see the issue?
[09:10:54] <Es0teric> when the page self-references itself?
[09:10:55] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you don't.  at least, not from jquery.
[09:11:04] <effortDee> unexpected token
[09:11:04] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric that's not a javascript construct.
[09:11:16] <duch_kazatel> effortDee right, because you're not specifying a width...
[09:11:19] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i know that is not a javascript construct...
[09:11:38] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric okay.
[09:12:25] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i am basically saying how do i extract post data after submit ?
[09:12:38] <decx> effortDee i say you're better off not reyling on horizontal scroll for that http://jsfiddle.net/decx/yjYJ4/283/
[09:12:40] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric server-side?  or client-side?
[09:12:45] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel client-side
[09:12:54] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric by grabbing it before it gets submitted.
[09:13:13] <effortDee> thankyou decx
[09:13:57] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel hmmm i see.. well the only way for me to grab it like that is if i ajax it
[09:14:07] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric nope.
[09:14:24] <duch_kazatel> you can prevent the default event, grab your data, and then submit it via JS no problem.
[09:14:35] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel how do i submit via js though?
[09:14:38] <effortDee> decx
[09:14:47] <effortDee> im making a video that is loads of videos put together horizontally
[09:14:53] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric .trigger('submit') or .submit()
[09:15:08] <effortDee> so wanted it on load instead of onclick as the video widths will be set already
[09:15:11] <effortDee> but thanks, taht helps
[09:15:19] <effortDee> so that all the videos are on autoplay
[09:15:25] <effortDee> and the scroll auto scrolls on page load
[09:15:28] <effortDee> onload
[09:15:28] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel so if i am already on a .on('submit') can just do .trigger($(this)) ?
[09:15:32] <effortDee> looking good tho!
[09:15:42] <decx> well that's just the basic of a viewport and a wrapper for horizontal movement, you can do whatever you want from there ;)
[09:15:59] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric if you're bound to the form, basically.  you'll have to add logic that detects if you submitted the form via a trigger or not.
[09:16:05] <duch_kazatel> effortDee that's going to be a really visually noisy effect, but fair enoug.
[09:16:11] <duch_kazatel> s/enoug/enough
[09:16:13] <effortDee> duch_kazatel
[09:16:20] <effortDee> its for an underwater video project im working on
[09:16:26] <effortDee> i know its possibl
[09:16:27] <effortDee> e
[09:16:29] <decx> the desolation of enoug
[09:16:34] <effortDee> :D so im just trying
[09:16:34] <duch_kazatel> decx++
[09:16:38] <effortDee> and see what the outcome is
[09:16:42] <effortDee> decx++
[09:16:47] <effortDee> duch_kazatel++
[09:17:16] <effortDee> duch_kazatel its not going to be that noisy visually because of the video im making
[09:17:28] <effortDee> the video will work at the exact same speed (the content) of the scroll
[09:17:35] <duch_kazatel> on every pageload, that'll get old quick imo, but meh.
[09:17:38] <effortDee> the whole idea will tie together beautifully i feel
[09:17:50] <effortDee> duch_kazatel its just for one project, only on one page
[09:17:55] <effortDee> for my underwater video idea
[09:18:15] <BillCriswell> I read "underwear video".
[09:18:35] <duch_kazatel> glad I wasn't the only one.
[09:19:11] <decx> well if you're moving video embed you need translateX anyway because scroll will definitely lag otherwise
[09:19:21] <decx> embeds*
[09:19:30] <effortDee> translatex ?
[09:19:54] <decx> yes, that's has gpu accel
[09:20:25] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Got the pool ready yet?
[09:20:27] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel so then this is what i have -> http://pastie.org/private/p77yemotnumyjcxoazmu3q
[09:21:22] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell It was great for a while.  then we had this crazyass dust storm and i got a small algae bloom, so my water got all coudy and weird.  been running the pump a ton lately.
[09:21:32] <duch_kazatel> which is fine because the new stuff is stupid cheap to run.
[09:21:50] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric $.trigger() is not the right thing at all..
[09:22:13] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Good shit.
[09:22:23] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric you run trigger() by doing $(this).trigger('submit');
[09:22:28] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel well i initially did $(this).trigger()
[09:22:31] <BillCriswell> My old roommate's pool is almost ready. Can't wait for that.
[09:22:51] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric .trigger() is run against an object and you have to feed it an event to synthetically trigger.
[09:22:58] <BillCriswell> but mostly the drinking by it and bbqing.
[09:23:16] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell nice.  we're having a weird spring because of the super dry winter, so summer should be strange.
[09:23:22] <duch_kazatel> not looking forward to the fires.
[09:23:26] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i get an error saying "too much recursion" after i added $(this).trigger('submit')
[09:23:36] <BillCriswell> Yuck.
[09:23:50] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric right, because you need to detect if the event was synthetically triggered or not.
[09:24:10] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel so i dont get it, i am already on a submit event
[09:24:11] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric alternatively, you can bind a separate, namespaced listener and trigger that sucker instead.
[09:24:21] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric right, and then you're triggering a submit event.
[09:24:33] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel ok so how do i bind that event?
[09:24:36] <duch_kazatel> you have to setup your code to recognized if the user triggered that event, or your code did.
[09:24:40] <duch_kazatel> you're all ready bound to it.
[09:25:22] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel i see.. so how do i go about that then?
[09:25:29] <duch_kazatel> !g jquery detect if event manually triggered
[09:25:31] <b-ot> duch_kazatel: jquery - Check if event is triggered by a human - Stack Overflow → http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6692031/check-if-event-is-triggered-by-a-human
[09:26:31] <Es0teric> duch_kazatel so then how am i supposed to use that with trigger() ?
[09:26:38] <Es0teric> the submit event already was clicked at that point
[09:26:57] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric ... really?
[09:27:04] <duch_kazatel> let me do this for you...
[09:27:38] <BillCriswell> I hate when there's like a 20px range of something looking ugly in a responsive design.
[09:28:51] <duch_kazatel> Es0teric http://pastie.org/9190049
[09:28:58] <duch_kazatel> real easy...
[09:31:07] <duch_kazatel> BillCriswell i'm looking forward to grilling this year, too.
[09:31:30] <decx> looking forward? does that mean you stop at some point in the year?
[09:31:41] <duch_kazatel> where I live, yeah.
[09:31:50] <decx> that doesn't fly in my region. grilllife
[09:32:06] <duch_kazatel> the torrential downpours and occasional tornado warnings have been encouraging me to not always be outside
[09:32:31] <decx> doesnt stop people here
[09:32:41] <duch_kazatel> D:
[09:33:05] <gnarf> Es0teric: you can also unbind submit, trigger, and rebind if you have the event handler as a named function
[09:34:38] <noregret_> how can I ajaxify a form? is there something within jquery?
[09:34:55] <duch_kazatel> noregret_ check out event binding with .on() and $.ajax();
[09:35:25] <noregret_> duch_kazatel: ah, you mean just shoot an ajax requst on the submit's click
[09:35:49] <duch_kazatel> not on the click.
[09:35:51] <duch_kazatel> on the submit.
[09:36:01] <gnarf> there is also serialize
[09:36:04] <gnarf> `api serialize
[09:36:04] <b-ot> gnarf: .serialize(): Encode a set of form elements as a string for submission. http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[09:36:13] <duch_kazatel> bb
[09:36:16] <duch_kazatel> *brb
[09:36:48] <noregret_> ah i see
[09:36:51] <gnarf> noregret_: i used to use a plugin called ajaxForm cuz it did most of this for you
[09:37:03] <gnarf> though that was years ago the last time i used it
[09:37:31] <noregret_> gnarf: http://jquery.malsup.com/form/ =)
[09:47:28] <duch_kazatel> awww sheeeit.
[09:48:21] <duch_kazatel> anybody here play with hood.ie at all?
[09:48:59] <decx> all these tlds
[09:49:31] <decx> according to dumb.domains boob.holdings is availabe for $59.99
[09:49:37] <duch_kazatel> ++
[09:50:04] <thebope> hood.ie lol
[09:50:21] <duch_kazatel> :D
[09:50:28] <duch_kazatel> they recently got funding from mozilla.
[09:50:38] <duch_kazatel> well, "recently" as in "a few months ago"
[09:51:07] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Is the for like the offline stuff?
[09:51:15] <BillCriswell> I remember reading about it kind of.
[09:51:24] <decx> reads interesting
[09:51:42] <duch_kazatel> offline-first and noBackend.
[09:51:49] <duch_kazatel> installing it now to play around.
[09:52:27] <BillCriswell> "paper first" design.
[09:52:38] <BillCriswell> We should snail mail you the website first.
[09:53:29] <duch_kazatel> hahaha
[09:54:09] <duch_kazatel> in the old days at my last company, they used to have people overnight CD copies of PDFs for them to process.
[09:54:23] <BillCriswell> I'm glad I picked web development to get into because there is always a challenge here.
[09:54:36] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Yeah the first company I worked for did that.
[09:55:02] <duch_kazatel> webdev++
[09:56:23] <decx> can you print out that pdf and fax it to my office?
[09:56:27] <duch_kazatel> :(
[09:56:36] <BillCriswell> I always hated fax machines.
[09:56:37] <decx> i'm a project manager and i think 9 women will deliver a baby in 1 month
[09:56:56] <duch_kazatel> decx i did project management for a while.  i get scared away from the profession.
[09:56:57] <BillCriswell> I'd be a terrible project manager.
[09:58:20] <decx> well i can talk out of my ass for hours and absolve myself of any accountability with ease, i'm a natural
[09:58:46] <duch_kazatel> decx i couldn't stand when people expected me to do that shitt.
[09:59:07] <decx> gotta have that politican gene
[09:59:20] <duch_kazatel> hah
[10:01:49] <Synthbread> I am using jQuery UI's tabs.  I would like a JS function to run when a tab is clicked, regardless or not if it's already active.  Currently, I'm experimenting with the beforeActivate option, but it doesn't respond to clicks on the active tab.  Is there a jQuery UI-native way to do this?
[10:02:14] <duch_kazatel> .on('click', function(){});
[10:02:21] <duch_kazatel> just use normal event binding :)
[10:03:55] <Synthbread> duch_kazatel: oh nice, that totally works
[10:04:17] <Synthbread> duch_kazatel: I was binding to the <div>s for tab content, not the <li> tabs :)
[10:04:23] <Synthbread> duch_kazatel: thanks a lot!
[10:04:33] <duch_kazatel> you're welcome.
[10:14:20] <wirehack7> hello! i need a little help, searching since a while but cannot find something which will fit: I am searching for a little snippet to truncate long anchor links, I find dozens of truncate plugins, but all are too big etc. does anyone of you have one or know one? thank you!
[10:15:09] <duch_kazatel> wirehack7 what exactly are you trying to accomplish?
[10:16:15] <wirehack7> well, there is a link with link text like: <a href="http://blabla.com/very/long/long/long/long/url.htm">http://blabla.com/very/long/long/long/long/url.htm</a>, I want this to: <a href="http://blabla.com/very/long/long/long/long/url.htm">http://blabla.com/very/long/.../url.htm</a>
[10:16:52] <duch_kazatel> so you want to modify the .text() of the link - any particular reason you can't do that server-side?
[10:17:04] <BillCriswell> Weeeee .split() stuff.
[10:17:17] <wirehack7> duch_kazatel, no php etc
[10:17:23] <wirehack7> so I have to do this in JS
[10:17:52] <duch_kazatel> wirehack7 okay, then look at the various javascript string methods and properties.
[10:18:38] <BillCriswell> .split, .slice and .join
[10:20:39] <BillCriswell> wirehack7: http://jsbin.com/hicuv/1/edit should get you started.
[10:20:48] <wirehack7> okay thanks
[10:21:07] <decx> that's ridiculous
[10:22:00] <BillCriswell> decx: You're ridiculous.
[10:22:27] <BillCriswell> decx: Why ridiculous though based on the task?
[10:22:51] <duch_kazatel> the request is ridiculous imo.
[10:23:09] <decx> why not substr ?
[10:23:23] <decx> url.substr(0, 10) + '...' + url.substr(-5 + url.length);
[10:23:40] <MarcusVinter> If I had a day, month, and year in seperate fields, what would be the best way of turning this into one Date variable?
[10:23:50] <duch_kazatel> loaded question.
[10:23:52] <BillCriswell> decx: That's cool but I assumed he wanted to show whole dir names.
[10:24:01] <decx> oh right that makes sense
[10:24:03] <duch_kazatel> where is the data headed/what is it getting used for, etc.
[10:24:17] <MarcusVinter> date will be used for comparison
[10:25:21] <MarcusVinter> I want it in a format that moment.js can use also.
[10:25:44] <BillCriswell> MarcusVinter: Smart man for using moment
[10:26:00] <decx> cant your through anything at moment and it'll stick?
[10:26:03] <decx> throw
[10:26:08] <decx> wow through.... yikes
[10:26:19] <decx> such grace, many typo
[10:26:20] <BillCriswell> decx: As long as you pass the right format string with it.
[10:26:31] <BillCriswell> moment([ year, month, day ]); can work.
[10:26:42] <BillCriswell> Can recall is month would need to be zero based or not off the top of my head.
[10:27:14] <BillCriswell> Ok, it is zero based... so month - 1
[10:27:29] <MarcusVinter> Thank you BillCriswell, I appricaite it!
[10:31:03] <alaing> I 'm trying to work out the differences between jquery ui widget factorys  _on and jquery .on
[10:35:25] <bberry> How can i get one of my javascript files on github to be imported in jsfiddle
[10:37:14] <pmercado> why $.get   return in function( data ) data parameter a "document" element ?? it must return html string '

[10:38:06] <duch_b0t> pmercado: Paste links, not code. http://gist.github.com is great. Sites like http://jsbin.com/, http://jsfiddle.net/, and http://www.webdevout.net/test let people easily run your code, but can be slow. Please do not use http://pastebin.com, the reasons are many. See !pastebin
[10:38:07] <pmercado> "depending on the MIME type of the response. It is also passed the text status of the response."
[10:38:15] <duch_kazatel> ffff bot.
[10:38:52] <pmercado> uhm..... is there a way to set mime type return? when loading from file:// ?
[10:39:17] <BillCriswell> fffffffffff
[10:39:18] <duch_kazatel> pmercado you can't load from your hard drive with ajax
[10:39:20] <duch_kazatel> you need a server.
[10:40:38] <pmercado> uhm, I can use $.get, but data have different data type from firefox and from web-kit based
[10:41:00] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ pmercado

[10:42:24] <pmercado> aahh aha! fourth parameter must be "html"  xD
[10:44:16] <MarcusVinter> Is this in correct format, when taking some element values for each day month and year and combining them to create a date? 			var inputStartDate = moment([$('#element_1_3').val(),$('#element_1_2').val(),$('#element_1_1').val()]);
[10:48:54] <BillCriswell> MarcusVinter: That should work.
[10:49:43] <MarcusVinter> Or might I need "new Date(moment etc....." after the equals?
[10:50:34] <BillCriswell> MarcusVinter: Nope. Shouldn't have to touch Date()
[10:50:45] <MarcusVinter> Because moments is handling it?
[10:50:56] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[10:51:07] <MarcusVinter> Sorry, I have no knowledge of javascript, just started today so its going to be a tough few weeks :P
[10:51:09] <MarcusVinter> THanks :D
[10:51:27] <BillCriswell> Haha it's all good. Sure it'll go well. Seem to grok it better than most already.
[10:52:16] <MarcusVinter> I like that term grok, haha. Thanks. I hope so :P
[10:57:06] <MarcusVinter> I have a complicated question for you. If I have off peak and on-peak date ranges for my booking form, whats the best way to store these ranges for me to call them later to compare them to my moments date I just set? I have about 10 date ranges across a year that I'll need to compare my date to.
[11:00:27] <BillCriswell> MarcusVinter: Never had to do it... I might try like var peak = [ [45, 70], [ 80, 102 ] ];  where each number is the day of the YEAR and loop through those and see if the day of the year they entered is between any of those sets.
[11:00:55] <BillCriswell> I'd have to look through moments docs a bit to see if there's a better method, though.
[11:01:39] <MarcusVinter> Thats a great idea. For some reason comparing the day of the year never occured to me. Great stuff. I'll just follow you on twitter.
[11:01:41] <MarcusVinter> :D
[11:02:11] <MarcusVinter> Have I found the right one? @crswll
[11:02:22] <BillCriswell> Yes.
[11:02:47] <MarcusVinter> Great, thanks :D
[11:04:07] <BillCriswell> MarcusVinter: There's a .isBefore and .isAfter method in moment which could be another approach.
[11:04:37] <Uhkis> https://twitter.com/crswll/status/466757384330043392
[11:04:37] <b-ot> Uhkis: @crswll: Netflix appears to be down… I need an adult.
[11:04:38] <Uhkis> hahaha
[11:05:02] <BillCriswell> That night was awful.
[11:05:14] <MarcusVinter> oh for comparison. Thanks, I'll be sure to check those out. Cheers buddy :P
[11:05:25] <BillCriswell> No problem.
[11:06:01] <naschine> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14897571/moment-js-date-between-dates
[11:06:20] <naschine> apparently there is a range plugin for moment.js, so you can use .contains()
[11:06:42] <naschine> perhaps equals 'between' in SQL
[11:07:38] <BillCriswell> Ah nice, lots of little neat things in that.
[11:08:10] <BillCriswell> moment.fn.between = function (start, end) { return this.isAfter(start) && this.isBefore(end); } is what I was thinkinging but since it's writtenalready and actually tested haha
[11:09:30] <BillCriswell> I have serious issues reading coffeescript.
[11:10:19] <naschine> I don't know if it's required to have it match the dates <,> or <=,>=
[11:10:55] <naschine> but the range plugin has some nice functions added I see ^^
[11:12:15] <athan> Hey folks, what would be the best way to convert a <span>
[11:12:17] <athan> sorry
[11:12:26] <athan> a span's text to a float?
[11:12:39] <tw2113> huh
[11:12:45] <duch_kazatel> you don't.
[11:12:49] <duch_kazatel> you can float elements.
[11:12:49] <athan> I'm using $('#foo').text() to get the contents
[11:12:56] <athan> I'm using $('#foo').val() returns 0 :/
[11:13:04] <duch_kazatel> .val() is for form elements.
[11:13:16] <athan> sorry, I mean to get the values inside the element
[11:13:24] <athan> and to turn the value into a floating point number
[11:13:26] <duch_kazatel> "values inside the element" huh?
[11:13:27] <athan> to coerce the type
[11:13:36] <duch_kazatel> oh - parseFloat()
[11:13:36] <athan> <span>(value)</span>
[11:13:48] <duch_kazatel> parseFloat($('#foo').text());
[11:13:50] <athan> duch_kazatel: Thank you :)
[11:13:55] <CrowX-> is there an application of some sort, in which you could load your js app, and whatever library you're using(for example jQuery), that will return you the library you're using minus the parts of it that never get used
[11:14:05] <CrowX-> so it kind of minifies the library to the parts you really need
[11:14:14] <athan> CrowX-: That's what I'm trying to do >:D
[11:14:17] <duch_kazatel> CrowX- you can custom build jquery to only include what you want.
[11:14:17] <athan> you should learn haskell
[11:14:37] <duch_kazatel> but i'm not aWare of anything that actively scans to see what you're using.
[11:14:39] <athan> it's like a dependency minimizer
[11:15:04] <duch_kazatel> but the semi-modularization of jquery is precisely so you can do things like that.
[11:15:20] <CrowX-> athan, that's my idea! :p
[11:16:01] <duch_kazatel> err, *semi-recent
[11:16:09] <athan> CrowX-: It would be really hard to structure the parser and linker in something like node or ruby, but if you can do it, go for it!! I like haskell for it's structure and... algebraic side :P
[11:16:26] <athan> it's all about package management
[11:16:26] <athan> also
[11:16:29] <athan> install NixOS
[11:16:33] <athan> that's the good stuff
[11:16:48] <CrowX-> I was thinking of using python
[11:17:02] <athan> I'm not as familiar unfortunately :/
[11:17:16] <athan> haskell is like... logic/math
[11:17:23] <athan> so it's really good for organization
[11:17:26] <athan> but again, go for it!!!
[11:17:50] <CrowX-> hmm, I always looked at haskell like a school project /hackers' playground type of thing, like openBSD :P
[11:18:00] <CrowX-> never thought anyone would use it in a production environment
[11:30:26] <antiPoP> Hi
[11:31:59] <antiPoP> I have some code whihc resizes some text in order to fit a div. However, sometimes seems the text width is calculated before the previous font size is applied, so I get wrong results. how can i fix this?
[11:32:13] <antiPoP> Is there some way to detect when the css has been applied?
[11:32:36] <dmoreno> I need to convert a color HSL to RGB or HEX, someone knows?
[11:32:37] <CrowX-> what does jquery.min.map do?
[11:33:00] <antiPoP> CrowX this is used to debug teh minified version
[11:34:20] <CrowX-> antiPoP, debug when/by who?
[11:34:33] <BillCriswell> by you whenever you want.
[11:34:48] <CrowX-> so it's not needed in a production environment?
[11:35:09] <BillCriswell> It's only requested when the dev tools are open.
[11:35:28] <ecky--ptang-zoob> when I display a year selectbox in jquery UI datepicker, the lowest month  is 2004 - how can this be set to 1900?
[11:36:29] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-minDate
[11:36:42] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Yes I tried this: minDate: new Date(1880, 1, 1)
[11:36:45] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but it's not working
[11:37:59] <Synthbread> is it a bad idea to give <a> tags in jQuery UI tabs an element id?
[11:39:46] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Oh it's yearRange
[11:50:35] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but the months I can't set like this, it displays only 5 months by default :/
[11:51:31] <athan> Are the internals of .change() pretty tricky? I'm having a very peculiar bug. I've set break points inside my event handler for when I update a different element (on the change of this element, I mean), yet they only break when I focusout. It's really confusing me :S
[11:52:18] <duch_kazatel> athan .change() .on('change' under the hood.
[11:52:40] <BillCriswell> Just realized using the term break points for JS and CSS is really confusing. haha
[11:52:51] <BillCriswell> I was like "what the hell does the break point have to do with anything"
[11:52:55] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[11:54:16] <ecky--ptang-zoob> Does anyone know how to display all 12 months in the select box in the datepicker
[11:54:17] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ?
[11:54:29] <athan> BillCriswell: Right?? The whole thing is like the law system
[11:54:34] <athan> confusing enough to waste our time
[11:54:39] <athan> :P
[11:55:11] <athan> I've got to say, the current state of web design etc. is appauling, compared to the research done in type theory and programming languages like haskell.
[11:55:26] <duch_kazatel> *appalling
[11:55:29] <duch_kazatel> and I disagree.
[11:55:49] <duch_kazatel> things are by no means perfect, but we
[11:56:00] <duch_kazatel> *we're getting all sorts of neat tools and toys these days.
[11:56:08] <ecky--ptang-zoob> why would it show only 5 months by default, that makes no sense
[11:56:18] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob do you have a fiddle?
[11:56:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> I'll make one
[11:57:29] <ecky--ptang-zoob> http://jsfiddle.net/gUnm3/
[11:57:38] <ecky--ptang-zoob> click the textfield, it shows only January to may
[11:58:28] <athan> duch_kazatel: Have you ever studied different languages? Like ML, Hope, Idris, Adga?
[11:58:37] <athan> non-imperative languages?
[11:58:41] <duch_kazatel> athan a few.
[11:58:53] <BillCriswell> ecky--ptang-zoob: What month is it exactly 100 years ago?
[11:59:08] <athan> i guess we should agree to disagree then :P
[11:59:14] <duch_kazatel> ecky--ptang-zoob maxDate: "-16Y", that's PROBABLY your problem ;)_
[11:59:30] <duch_kazatel> athan i'm not saying things are currently perfect, but they're certainly much better than they were :)
[11:59:56] <ecky--ptang-zoob> what the
[12:00:14] <BillCriswell> If you were around for IE5 days it's pretty close to perfect.
[12:00:34] <duch_kazatel> I was around for the tail end of the IE6 days
[12:00:49] <ecky--ptang-zoob> when I remove that and also the maxdate, it works
[12:00:58] <ecky--ptang-zoob> but when I set maxDate to now(), it displays only 5 months
[12:01:06] <ecky--ptang-zoob> because we are May now
[12:01:09] <duch_kazatel> right
[12:01:20] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ooh
[12:01:24] <ecky--ptang-zoob> ok i'm stupid
[12:03:51] <BillCriswell> What's with everyone thinking they're stupid when they don't get something right away? lol
[12:04:04] <BillCriswell> This shit isn't easy.
[12:04:11] <duch_kazatel> folks need to appreciate being wrong more, i think.
[12:04:29] <duch_kazatel> being wrong != stupid.  it's cheesy, but it's a learning opportunity.
[12:04:34] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Absolutely. When you're wrong you learn something, when you're right... you're just right haha.
[12:04:46] <Uhkis> being right after being wrong is the thing to appreciate
[12:04:48] <duch_kazatel> and even when you're right, you might be wrong.
[12:04:56] <athan> I'm trying to make a suite of languages that are well-typed - one for presentation ambiguous of the context properties (2d, 3d, vector-capable, pixelated, etc.), semantic organization that is also generic (each perciever may have different understanding structure, ie microframework vs. semantic html - they can coorallate) where you then map your flat content on your different organization schemes, and then your actual content (sourcing
[12:04:56] <athan> from users, unknowns, combinations, etc. Very generic (monoids, functors, etc)). My goal is to have all of this compile down to both cluster server architectures and very adaptable front-end styles as well (modernizr influmenced, caniuse, sockjs, etc). With the whole thing configurable from a closed-form config file, like nixos. Then I'll write a "browser" and a js->my_stuff interpreter, to steal everyone's work :P
[12:05:03] <duch_kazatel> woah spam
[12:05:10] <athan> I'd say well thought
[12:05:19] <athan> or... focused
[12:05:49] <MetalHead77> Anyone know if it is possible to extract sponsored ads from facebook's newsfeed into your application?
[12:05:55] <MetalHead77> Ads such as http://prntscr.com/3k5e4f
[12:06:15] <duch_kazatel> "extract"?
[12:07:15] <MetalHead77> duch_kazatel: extract/scrape/retrieve
[12:07:49] <duch_kazatel> err, to do what with them?
[12:07:59] <duch_kazatel> you can nab that info, sure.
[12:08:03] <duch_kazatel> but not sure what you want that stuff for.
[12:09:11] <MetalHead77> duch_kazatel: How? I've been trying for over three days now.
[12:09:30] <duch_kazatel> what are you trying to do with it?
[12:09:30] <MetalHead77> duch_kazatel: Meeting a project requirement for a client
[12:09:35] <MetalHead77> Meeting a project requirement for a client
[12:09:42] <duch_kazatel> that doesn't tell me anything.
[12:09:58] <duch_kazatel> what do they want to do with these ads?
[12:10:01] <MetalHead77> Competitive intelligence, more than likely
[12:12:22] <duch_kazatel> you could probably setup phantom to scrape that content for you with a little jquery magic maybe based on seeing the word "sponsored" in that given area.
[12:12:44] <Velveeta> rarrrrrrr git!
[12:12:52] * Velveeta hulk smashes his Jenkins server configuration.
[12:12:55] <duch_kazatel> but it's hard to suggest much of anything because i'm not really sure what the end goal is.
[12:13:08] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta nooo! jenkins loves you and wants you to be happy!
[12:13:22] <Velveeta> jenkins make velveeta emotion bad!
[12:13:23] <MetalHead77> duch_kazatel: You're just talking blindly. Have you ever even looked at facebook's html news feed source/
[12:13:25] <MetalHead77> *?
[12:13:36] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[12:13:51] <duch_kazatel> that got real rude real quick
[12:13:58] <MetalHead77> I'm just asking
[12:14:08] <duch_kazatel> looking at it right.
[12:14:10] <duch_kazatel> *right now.
[12:14:12] <duch_kazatel> but whatever.
[12:14:21] <BillCriswell> There was "maybe's" in there.
[12:14:26] <duch_kazatel> brb
[12:14:32] <MetalHead77> duch_kazatel: Scraping facebook is not like your normal everyday scrape job
[12:14:53] <Velveeta> why not?
[12:14:58] <Velveeta> it's just markup
[12:15:23] <MetalHead77> Velveeta: I'll say the samething to you that I said to him
[12:15:59] <Velveeta> i'll see your pedantic ramblings and raise you one accusation of being underqualified to deliver what your client wants
[12:16:40] <Velveeta> it's just markup... it's asynchronously loaded, so you could set up timeouts or something to deal with that, and use something like phantom, like duch suggested, to harvest the pertinent markup
[12:17:06] <Velveeta> target it with jquery and some form of string matching, grab the parent container, and dump the relevant details from it
[12:17:52] <BillCriswell> then bang your head against the wall when they change things up on you.
[12:19:08] <duch_kazatel> back
[12:19:53] <duch_kazatel> Velveeta++
[12:21:20] <duch_kazatel> scraping content off of the facebook side is a shaky proposition at best
[12:21:44] <BillCriswell> $('.uiStreamSponsoredLink').each(function () { console.log($(this).closest('.userContentWrapper').parent()); }); wasn't as bad to get at as I thought.
[12:23:11] <BillCriswell> I'd love to see that actual source code.
[12:23:19] <BillCriswell> Instead of whatever the hell it gets delivered as.
[12:23:53] <MetalHead77> All you guys do is talk
[12:23:58] <duch_kazatel> wtf
[12:24:02] <duch_kazatel> what do you want us to do?
[12:24:14] <MetalHead77> It's okay
[12:24:16] <MetalHead77> Nevermind.
[12:24:20] <Uhkis> instead we're supposed to do your job for you?
[12:25:13] <BillCriswell> The code I posted gets the right code though haha
[12:26:10] <BillCriswell> s/code/node
[12:27:59] <duch_kazatel> hahahaha
[12:32:44] <duch_kazatel> we should start a running list of people that ask questions and then reject legitimate solutions/toss out thinly veiled insults in response
[12:32:58] <thang_> start a tumblr
[12:34:26] <MetalHead77> What you have all given are assumptions
[12:34:37] <MetalHead77> assumptions don't hold true for software engineering
[12:34:49] <MetalHead77> things have to be tried, tested and proven
[12:35:05] <duch_kazatel> we're tossing out ideas for you to try
[12:35:22] <MetalHead77> If you haven't learn anything today, please learn that.
[12:35:24] <duch_kazatel> i'm not about to spin up phantom and write a P.O.C. for you.
[12:36:23] <wormmd> Everyone's so entitled these days...
[12:36:30] <duch_kazatel> seriously what the hell
[12:36:57] <wormmd> I would like to thank everyone in this channel who has ever given me free help.
[12:37:23] <wormmd> You are all amazing, and your contributions to my knowledge and work are truly priceless.
[12:37:31] <wormmd> That is all.
[12:37:31] <duch_kazatel> glad to hear, wormmd :)
[12:42:29] <teamcoltra> lol looking back over that, ready to defend him over what might be a miscommunication or something... but no, that guy was just a dick.
[12:45:34] <duch_kazatel> meh, he said he's been working on it for three days now.
[12:45:41] <duch_kazatel> i'd be frustrated, too.
[13:02:47] <BillCriswell> brotherashe: .val(()
[13:02:55] <BillCriswell> .val() ***********
[13:03:33] <BillCriswell> Anyone has any RSS feed statistics on non-nerd sites?
[13:04:22] <brotherashe> BillCriswell - thanks. that's what I gathered from the API - looks like it was built to handle checkboxes, etc. as well. Should .val ALWAYS be my go to when working with form fields?
[13:05:21] <BillCriswell> brad: for adjusting a checked state you should use .prop('checked', bool)
[13:14:51] <lcsjuniorsi> hi
[13:15:39] <lcsjuniorsi> where is the support ??
[13:16:28] <lcsjuniorsi> i'd like of information bug in jQuery...
[13:16:36] <lcsjuniorsi> plase
[13:16:39] <lcsjuniorsi> please*
[13:17:30] <BillCriswell> lcsjuniorsi: How long have you been using jQuery?
[13:20:37] <__joshua___> lcsjuniorsi: most likely, the bug is not in jquery
[13:21:19] <naschine> He's lo
[13:21:24] <naschine> *ng gone
[13:21:38] <BillCriswell> naschine: Haha.
[13:21:44] <naschine> 2 mins was all he had  xD
[13:21:46] <BillCriswell> Must have got the tab complete in before he left.
[13:22:23] <__joshua___> heh
[13:22:47] <naschine> It's a pity he left that quick... I would've been interested in his bug :D
[13:23:39] <__joshua___> it was probably some misunderstanding in his quote.   His poor english might have kept us trying for awhile.
[13:23:43] <__joshua___> code*
[13:23:54] <__joshua___> I good at england.
[13:24:37] <BillCriswell> Yeah, I just know most of the "bugs" in here are just user error.
[13:24:53] <naschine> Hey! I keep struggling myself with it... sometimes my english is somewhat too influenced by my german ;)
[13:25:52] <naschine> BillCriswell Since I'm working as developer and have to deal with a lot of our customers, giving them support and sh*t, it's 99% user error ;P
[13:26:07] <BillCriswell> Sure is.
[13:26:36] <naschine> They come up with ways of using our software, I never would have even dreamed of... it's fascinating!
[13:28:22] <PhilFromHeck> I want to create a site that has 4 horizontal buttons at the top, and then the subsequent content beneath fade in and out accordingly. Would the best way to do this be toggling display and then animating the opacity? Having all the divs load to the same absolute position?
[13:33:57] <__joshua___> jquery ui tabs can do that for you, if you are lazy
[13:34:13] <PhilFromHeck> I want to create a site that has 4 horizontal buttons at the top, and then the subsequent content beneath fade in and out accordingly. Would the best way to do this be toggling display and then animating the opacity? Having all the divs load to the same absolute position?
[13:35:20] <duch_kazatel> PhilFromHeck that's the basic gist.
[13:35:21] <__joshua___> "toggling display and then animating the opacity?"  I would either a: use css animation, or b) $('this_tab_selector').fadeIn();
[13:35:33] <duch_kazatel> ^^ listen to __joshua___
[13:39:55] <dm7freek> Hello, I'm trying to position animated graphics in a spiral, is there an equation I can use to do this?
[13:41:09] <__joshua___> do you know how to move things around in a circle?
[13:41:16] <__joshua___> hows your trig?
[13:41:33] * darkfrog likes pi
[13:41:48] <__joshua___> if you can move things a circle, you can just increase the radius to make a spiral
[13:42:00] <dm7freek> __joshua___: my trig is ok, but I havent really done anythin like this before (including moving in a circle)
[13:42:09] <dm7freek> __joshua___: sounds simple enough, how do you do a circle>
[13:42:43] <__joshua___> right, lets use polar coordinates, will be simpler later
[13:43:25] <__joshua___> polar coordinates = radius and an angle (from an origin)
[13:44:02] <dm7freek> __joshua___: right, so the "hard" part is converting an angle to a position
[13:44:14] <__joshua___> x = r * cos(angle);  y = r * sin(angle);  position = origin.x + x, origin.y+y
[13:44:47] <dm7freek> __joshua___: then each iteration, I add to r a bit, and to angle a bit more
[13:44:54] <__joshua___> for you animation, you will increasing angle to move in a circle, and increase r and angle to move in a spiral
[13:45:01] <__joshua___> exactly
[13:45:13] <dm7freek> __joshua___: sweet, I'll see how that goes. thanks
[13:59:45] <BillCriswell> I was just told I do difficult things way too quickly and easy things take far too long.
[13:59:54] <BillCriswell> How are you supposed to work on something boring quickly?
[14:01:16] <duch_kazatel> wait like they said it was a legit problem?
[14:01:32] <dm7freek> __joshua___: worked like a charm
[14:01:36] <__joshua___> :D
[14:02:25] <BillCriswell> duch_kazatel: Haha no. Just something someone pointed out.
[14:02:56] <duch_kazatel> hah okay.
[14:14:36] <Fernandos> hi
[14:15:38] <Fernandos> I'm writing a jQuery plugin and don't know why I can't access options from functions other than init().. here's a minimal example: http://hastebin.com/vitaduxumi.js
[14:16:40] <StanAccy> With the .find( selector ) method, can I have the results of the find invoke an anon funcion or do I have to invoke another jquery function first?
[14:16:55] <StanAccy> .$().find(...).function(){} ; ?
[14:17:04] <BillCriswell> StanAccy: What kind of function?
[14:17:06] <duch_kazatel> StanAccy cou can't do that.
[14:17:15] <StanAccy> Two methods - one a log line, the other another method
[14:17:17] <duch_kazatel> you CAN run jquery methods against it.
[14:17:52] <StanAccy> Im trying to figure out why the .find().select2() isnt applying the select() JS. So I thought Id try and add a console.log to the results of each of the find()
[14:18:13] <duch_kazatel> you can do .each() against the results of .find()
[14:18:15] <BillCriswell> StanAccy: Are you sure .find() is finding something? Check the lenght.
[14:18:24] <StanAccy> BillCriswell: Thats what Im trying to determine :-)
[14:18:36] <StanAccy> no log lines == not finding anything :-)
[14:18:44] <StanAccy> duch_kazatel: Perfect, thanks
[14:18:51] <duch_kazatel> StanAccy try checking the .length property of the result.
[14:18:52] <BillCriswell> console.log($('.something').find('.foo').length);
[14:19:03] <BillCriswell> What you're doing should work without an each.
[14:19:19] <BillCriswell> Man, print stylesheets are something else.
[14:20:33] <BillCriswell> How the hell did DMX get stuck in my head.
[14:21:04] <dm7freek> Are there wobbly easing functions
[14:21:04] <dm7freek> ?
[14:21:16] <BillCriswell> I'm out of here. byeeeee
[14:21:23] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos can you setup a functioning example in a fiddle?
[14:26:32] <MetalHead77> Willing to pay anyone that knows how to extract sponsored ads from facebook's news feed. Ads such as http://prntscr.com/3k5e4f. I aslo have a test facebook account already setup for testing.
[14:27:14] <duch_kazatel> wrong channel for that, MetalHead77
[14:42:18] <__joshua___> MetalHead77: did you ask this yesterday?
[14:42:30] <__joshua___> cause I helped a guy do that yesterday
[14:42:32] <duch_kazatel> we're not even trying.
[14:42:38] <duch_kazatel> we're just offering conjecture.
[14:43:08] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[14:45:10] <thebope> I wonder where the other 76 MetalHeads are
[14:46:42] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: in a bit.. on the phone :)
[14:51:59] <jphase> any new developments on date range pickers? last one I used was an addon to jQuery UI a few years back:  http://robido.com/test/daterangepicker/  -  open to suggestions that don't use jQuery UI :)
[14:52:37] <jphase> google doesn't seem to be too promising :\
[14:52:37] <Fernandos> MetalHead77: what's hard about that?
[14:53:28] <Fernandos> MetalHead77: just setup a crawler, tell it which xpath queries to look for and feed that into a db
[14:54:20] <Fernandos> MetalHead77: There are even "services" or tools that do almost all of that work for you. Some are even visual, just use your google-fu. Btw. that'd be something for #jobs or so
[14:57:02] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos he was in here earlier being pretty rude to a bunch of us who were trying to give him places to start.
[14:59:35] <Fernandos> hmm.. -> /kick <reason>
[14:59:50] <duch_kazatel> not up to me ;)
[15:09:59] <jphase> MetalHead77: if by "extract" you mean remove, I wrote a tampermonkey script many moons ago for that:  http://hastebin.com/onevolodox.js   -   otherwise definitely more of a place for #jobs as Fernandos mentioned :P
[15:10:40] <duch_kazatel> he wants to copy the ad to display elsewhere, but now I am lol'ing at the fact that the hard part has been done.
[15:10:49] <jphase> oh hehe
[15:11:16] <jphase> yeah, as you mentioned, sounds like a job for a 3rd party service like corsproxy.com or something
[15:11:28] <jphase> unless you wanted to be 1337 about it and use node.js with cheerio ;)
[15:12:41] <__joshua___> or do the whole thing phantomjs or such
[15:12:50] <jphase> ^ agreed
[15:13:02] <duch_kazatel> there are tons of headless browsers out there that'll let you do it.
[15:13:13] <jphase> lynx ftw!!!
[15:13:15] <jphase> hehe
[15:13:27] <jphase> hell.... wget ftw
[15:13:35] <duch_kazatel> curl
[15:13:41] <jphase> or file_get_contents in php
[15:13:42] <jphase> or curl
[15:13:43] <jphase> yeah
[15:13:46] <jphase> </rant>
[15:14:33] * lucs joined the channel to ask a question, remembers to carefully craft it with a jsfiddle demo, and solves his problem :)
[15:14:33] <__joshua___> I tried using node-phantom recently.  I don't recommend.
[15:14:37] <lucs> Buh bye!
[15:16:37] <duch_kazatel> lucs :)
[15:16:40] <duch_kazatel> oh and he's gone
[15:17:56] <duch_kazatel> but guyz "Scraping facebook is not like your normal everyday scrape job"
[15:17:59] <duch_kazatel> so yknow
[15:19:12] <jphase> yeah, they tend to change their markup rather often
[15:19:29] <jphase> that's why multi-billion dollar companies without APIs make me sad :(
[15:19:52] <duch_kazatel> facebook HAS APIs, but they're probably not pumping sponsored content through them.
[15:20:08] <__joshua___> don't see why they would
[15:20:09] <jphase> yeah, meant more for the sake of pulling ads
[15:20:11] <duch_kazatel> exactly.
[15:21:10] <duch_kazatel> i worked at a place that did a bunch of content scraping from a ton of different sites and they'd change stuff all the time.  just had to write code that was as resilient as possible and fix it when things broke.
[15:22:04] <jphase> all you *can* do with scraping :(
[15:22:23] <duch_kazatel> yep.  especially for something like that.  meh.
[15:22:23] <Fernandos> ..meh a leecher
[15:23:35] <Fernandos> jphase: Why would he want to scrap ads? To maybe inject the same ads into his own ad-system and avoid all the computing?
[15:23:55] <duch_kazatel> he said earlier his client wanted it for some kind of business intel deal
[15:23:59] <jphase> not even sure how that'd really make much sense anyhow since they're computed based on your demographic
[15:24:11] <Fernandos> yeah it would loose all personalization
[15:24:16] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[15:24:29] <Fernandos> I only got HFT trading ads, until I disabled my account
[15:24:31] <duch_kazatel> yeah dude said "Competitive intelligence, more than likely"
[15:24:34] <jphase> *cough* use google adsense *cough*
[15:33:10] <Vivekananda> hi jquery
[15:33:38] <duch_kazatel> sup
[15:36:03] <Vivekananda> hi js.  I was writing some js and create a var using document.createElement. Now suddenly I had to create a big child to it so I did a jquery create ie $child =("<.....>"). Now I am wondering if there is a way to add this child to the element created in step1.  I am getting an error on trying :  myElement.append($child)
[15:36:15] <Vivekananda> hello duch_kazatel howve you been
[15:36:37] <duch_kazatel> !paste @ Vivekananda
[15:36:38] <b-ot> Vivekananda: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[15:37:33] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: havent created a sample code coz I assumed would be a simple problem
[15:38:31] <duch_kazatel> it's hard to understand what you're saying, but I think you want $(myElement).append($child)
[15:38:47] <duch_kazatel> document.createElement doesn't create jquery objects - you have to wrap it manually.
[15:42:53] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda that make sense?
[15:42:58] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: yes you are right so how do I wrap a js variable into a jquery object
[15:43:10] <duch_kazatel> i just showed you...
[15:43:27] <Vivekananda> o ok
[15:43:37] <duch_kazatel> why are you using document.createElement() in the first place?
[15:44:11] <Vivekananda> so for any element 'myelement'  created as a js variable if I say $(myelement)  it automatically become an object ?
[15:44:24] <duch_kazatel> wut.
[15:44:24] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: coz I am stupid :)
[15:44:48] <duch_kazatel> if you do $(myelement) you're putting it through jquery - you should cache the result and use that instead.
[15:44:54] <duch_kazatel> or create it using jquery in the first place.
[15:45:39] <Vivekananda> I mean I started off doing all in js but I found that lots of nodes and stuff have to be created and so I thought :  let me create the big node with jquery coz it is so short and then append it to the present  js variable
[15:45:39] <Vivekananda> and that is when all hell is loose
[15:46:09] <duch_kazatel> jquery doesn't attach itself everywhere - you can only use jquery methods on jquery objets, basically.
[15:47:14] <Vivekananda> hmm okay. But I was wondering if there is a way to convert a variable reference created in js  to a jquery object or  to convert a jquery object to a flat html element so I can add it to a js variable  using appendChild
[15:47:19] <Vivekananda> either one would be fine
[15:47:35] <duch_kazatel> the second one doesn't make any sense - use jQuery.
[15:47:49] <duch_kazatel> avoid either or those scenarios is at all possibkle.
[15:48:04] <duch_kazatel> it'll make your code real confusing down the road.
[15:48:11] <Vivekananda> hmm okay then I will have to write the entire thing from scratch then :(
[15:48:19] <duch_kazatel> what are you working on?
[15:48:31] <duch_kazatel> or why not just use vanilla JS instead?
[15:49:08] <Vivekananda> I dont know what it is or how it works and honestly the least no of dependencies I have the better I feel although it is fine if it gets me some performance gain
[15:49:21] <duch_kazatel> then do javascript.
[15:51:00] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: is there a way in pure js to create lots of child elements in a shorter way or do I have to write whole create lines for each tag <>  and attribute for it ?
[15:51:08] <Vivekananda> jquery is so much shorter
[15:51:53] <duch_kazatel> then use jquery.
[15:52:12] <duch_kazatel> or do this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/494143/creating-a-new-dom-element-from-an-html-string-using-built-in-dom-methods-or-pro
[15:54:09] <__joshua___> innerHTML, or documentfragment, or $
[15:59:37] <_bart> howdy
[16:00:15] <_bart> I was just wondering if I could use .on with 'hover', because the DOM changes the normal .hover method won't cut it
[16:00:17] <duch_kazatel> whuddup
[16:00:31] <duch_kazatel> yep.
[16:00:40] <duch_kazatel> the first arg to .on() can take any event.
[16:01:22] <_bart> I should probably divide my method in two .on()s though, knowing mouseenter and mouseleave
[16:01:41] <duch_kazatel> bingo
[16:03:24] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: here's a minimal example extracted from the jquery plugin I'm working on http://jsbin.com/movupese/2/edit
[16:03:27] <_bart> thanks
[16:03:47] <Fernandos> I couldn't access "options" from outside of the init function, not sure why..
[16:04:07] <Fernandos> guess I missed something obvious that I still can't make out in the code
[16:04:51] <duch_kazatel> why are you doing this.options = options; ?
[16:05:12] <duch_kazatel> console.log(options) and see what that returns you.
[16:05:20] <__joshua___> yeah, that will break it
[16:11:32] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: that't the final js, I wrote it in coffeescript
[16:12:12] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: is there like a shorter way of creating nodes and subnodes in pure js . I  found that using pure js is much more advantageous performance wise than using jquery
[16:13:02] <duch_kazatel> there will definitely be some performance gains depending on what you're doing.
[16:13:41] <Fernandos> Vivekananda: that's true, but it depends on the library you use. jsperf.com shows quite good comparisons
[16:13:50] <duch_kazatel> but not really - __joshua___ showed you your options
[16:14:07] <duch_kazatel> and you need to be careful with jsperf benchmarks.
[16:14:26] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: then I will stick with javascript
[16:14:37] <Vivekananda> as it happens still things are quite slow
[16:14:46] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: have a look at the site --
[16:15:06] <Vivekananda> www.safeview.com and try to input a product name and click submit
[16:16:15] <Fernandos> Vivekananda: What's that?
[16:16:20] <Fernandos> a realtime search?
[16:16:32] <Vivekananda> nope
[16:16:35] <duch_kazatel> where do i do the search?
[16:16:44] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: scroll down
[16:16:50] <duch_kazatel> woah wtf.
[16:16:54] <Fernandos> if there are many million db entries, then you cannot make it faster using js only..
[16:17:21] <Fernandos> caching layers and adding indexes to the required fields can make a huge difference though
[16:18:16] <duch_kazatel> depending on the case, returing all those results might not be necessary.
[16:18:40] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: woah ( good job) or woah ( you are incompetent and stupid and quit this ) ?
[16:19:12] <duch_kazatel> the animation was very jarring.
[16:19:18] <Vivekananda> Fernandos: currently only 20k enteries and will go up to 10 times
[16:19:28] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: hmm so I should redo that ?
[16:19:36] <Vivekananda> which one is jarring ? the last one right ?
[16:19:49] <duch_kazatel> the one where the entire area does that flip when scroll to it.
[16:19:52] <Fernandos> a vuln db, made using apache and php, not sure if that's intended or for the fun
[16:19:54] <duch_kazatel> i'd entirely remove that.
[16:20:14] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: you mean no animation ? or a slide in is okay ?
[16:20:20] <duch_kazatel> no animation at all.
[16:20:25] <Vivekananda> oo hmmm
[16:20:26] <chovy> what is diff bewten $input.attr('selected', true) and $input.prop('selected', true)
[16:20:26] <duch_kazatel> it's completely unnecessary.
[16:20:41] <duch_kazatel> chovy one reads html and the other reads the DOM
[16:20:44] <duch_kazatel> you want the latter.
[16:20:48] <chovy> .prop?
[16:20:49] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: just trying to give it a better feel
[16:20:54] <duch_kazatel> chovy yes
[16:21:03] <chovy> will that work with .is(':selected')
[16:21:12] <chovy> and can i do option:selected { } in css?
[16:21:17] <chovy> using .prop()?
[16:21:30] <duch_kazatel> should work fine iirc.
[16:21:42] <chovy> ok, cause i don't see the prop in the inspector
[16:21:46] <Fernandos> Vivekananda: you could make it like this http://www.exploit-db.com/search/ but with a better ui
[16:21:48] <chovy> after setting it
[16:22:00] <duch_kazatel> chovy right, because you're not editing the HTML.
[16:22:31] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda where's your code for the search autocomplete?
[16:22:43] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: site.js
[16:22:59] <Vivekananda> inside js/
[16:23:26] <duch_kazatel> seeing $.each(items, function (index, item) { inside of an autocomplete like that scares me.
[16:25:45] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: me too
[16:25:53] <Vivekananda> took me quite a bit to have that working
[16:26:08] <Vivekananda> I mean complicated code
[16:26:09] <duch_kazatel> the jquery each() methods can be very slkow.
[16:26:31] <chovy> duch_kazatel: thanks
[16:26:36] <chovy> what's the point of .attr then?
[16:26:38] <duch_kazatel> chovy sure.
[16:26:39] <chovy> for that
[16:26:42] <duch_kazatel> to read HTML.
[16:26:48] <Vivekananda> yes but I need to create a quick list ( as you see ) after getting the json
[16:27:10] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda $.each() is completely unnecessary for that.
[16:27:13] <chovy> see i would expect to see in dom '<option selected>'
[16:27:17] <chovy> but i don't see that with .prop()
[16:27:33] <duch_kazatel> chovy in DOM or in rendered html?
[16:27:33] <duch_kazatel> :)_
[16:27:38] <chovy> what is diff?
[16:27:42] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: you mean I dont have to iterate over json objects to fill up the list ?
[16:27:46] <chovy> isn't the inspector showing the DOM?
[16:28:00] <duch_kazatel> chovy the HTML panel and the DOM panels are distinct.
[16:28:11] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda I mean you can use a for loop instead of invoking jquery's enumerator.
[16:28:29] <Vivekananda> ooo okay. but I assumed it would be easier ot iterate
[16:28:44] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda you're complaining about speed...
[16:28:50] <Vivekananda> and not even sure how to iterate using just the for loop
[16:28:53] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: yep
[16:29:02] <Vivekananda> so I will have to learn to use the for inside the autocomplete
[16:29:02] <duch_kazatel> way easy let me show you.
[16:29:26] <chovy> duch_kazatel: haha ok. i guess i don't see onchange either in html, but its in dom inspector. makes sense.
[16:29:37] <duch_kazatel> :)
[16:31:06] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda http://jsfiddle.net/BypDa/1/
[16:31:15] <duch_kazatel> there's a for loop for objects.
[16:32:10] <duch_kazatel> there's also the for loop used for iteration - that's good for arrays.
[16:33:06] <Vivekananda> oka back
[16:33:08] <Vivekananda> lemme ssee
[16:34:09] <Vivekananda> okay nice
[16:34:15] <Vivekananda> lemme try this for the code then
[16:35:18] <Vivekananda> by the way duch_kazatel since you already have seen the site what I am currently working on is that in the products section each entry will have two checkboxes ( one for cve and one fore cpe ) and when checked they populate a temporary div
[16:35:23] <Vivekananda> and can be stored and retrived later
[16:35:47] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda you should probably learn about document fragments and how to use them.
[16:35:58] <Vivekananda> okay
[16:36:11] <Vivekananda> is that a jquery contruct or if not what is it
[16:36:13] <Vivekananda> lemme find
[16:36:17] <duch_kazatel> javascript construct :)
[16:36:29] <duch_kazatel> jquery makes use of them quite a bit, though.
[16:39:37] <Vivekananda> I am working on getting the input checkbox and retrieval to work
[16:39:47] <Vivekananda> as soon as I finish and merge that I will go ahead with the for loop
[16:40:11] <Vivekananda> git helps when I do incremental bits but messes up if I do more
[16:40:16] <Vivekananda> I have to learn git well too :(
[16:40:49] <duch_kazatel> branches are cheap.
[16:40:53] <duch_kazatel> I love git though.
[16:41:04] <duch_kazatel> you aren't working against your master branch right?
[16:41:12] <Vivekananda> I dont know git well enough
[16:41:15] <Vivekananda> sadly yes I am
[16:41:19] <duch_kazatel> noooooo.
[16:41:21] <Vivekananda> :(
[16:41:25] <Vivekananda> lol I know I know
[16:41:27] <duch_kazatel> git checkout -b branchNameHere
[16:41:32] <duch_kazatel> there's your new branch.
[16:41:35] <duch_kazatel> hack hack hack.
[16:42:03] <duch_kazatel> git push -u origin branchNameHere
[16:42:17] <Vivekananda> but to do branching and merging messes things up for me coz as I said I dont know git well
[16:42:26] <duch_kazatel> use branching.
[16:42:32] <duch_kazatel> and then submit PRs to merge things into master.
[16:42:33] <Vivekananda> yes I know I should
[16:42:42] <Vivekananda> prs ?
[16:42:48] <duch_kazatel> pull requests.
[16:42:52] <duch_kazatel> are you using github?
[16:42:58] <Vivekananda> bitbucket
[16:43:13] <duch_kazatel> https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BITBUCKET/Work+with+pull+requests
[16:43:16] <duch_kazatel> same basic concepts
[16:43:17] <duch_kazatel> but do it.
[16:43:22] <duch_kazatel> learn branching.
[16:43:35] <Vivekananda> I know a little and try to use it often but not often enough
[16:43:43] <Vivekananda> but tell me why would I need to do pulls ?
[16:43:55] <Vivekananda> I mean as i see it I will have local copies of master and its branch
[16:43:56] <duch_kazatel> pulls give you a nice clean interface to show when your code got into master.
[16:44:20] <duch_kazatel> the entire point is because git does diffs really efficiently (usually)
[16:44:25] <Vivekananda> so when I am done with a branch then simple git checkout master and then git merge mybranch
[16:44:26] <Vivekananda> isnt it ?
[16:44:29] <duch_kazatel> no.
[16:44:38] <duch_kazatel> push the branch up to origin.
[16:44:43] <duch_kazatel> submit a pull request.
[16:44:52] <duch_kazatel> are you working with other programmers?
[16:45:03] <Vivekananda> not right now but soon migh
[16:45:11] <duch_kazatel> then branching can be a big help.
[16:45:26] <Vivekananda> I know :(
[16:45:33] <duch_kazatel> basically, you should have a few different branches - release, master, and your working branches.
[16:46:02] <duch_kazatel> there are different names for these, but release should be the current released version, master the most current working version, and then the various branches.
[16:46:51] <Vivekananda> one reason why I did not create those things is coz no easy way in git to separate them out ie all workers will have access to all branches and that is bad
[16:47:20] <duch_kazatel> sure, then have them fork the repo and don't give them merge access.
[16:47:24] <duch_kazatel> that's why you have pull requests.
[16:47:49] <Vivekananda> but I am reading on what you wrote above : push the branch up then submit a pull request ....  That appears very upside down ? got me confused. Why push or pull when both branches are present with me locally ?
[16:47:55] <Vivekananda> but guess I should read your link
[16:48:06] <duch_kazatel> the pull request is them saying "i wanna have you pull my code into master pls"
[16:48:22] <duch_kazatel> the reason you do it up there is so it's out in the open - people can comment on it/whatever.
[16:48:41] <duch_kazatel> also: pushing the branch up means others can pull it down and work off it it, too.
[16:48:49] <duch_kazatel> so you can have multiple people working on the same branch.
[16:49:21] <Vivekananda> okay but then why not : branch --> work --> merge --> push    rather than   ,  branch -> work --> push -> pull -->  something ..
[16:49:47] <duch_kazatel> because of the pull request
[16:49:52] <duch_kazatel> it's easier to track that way.
[16:50:26] <duch_kazatel> the nice thing about git is is makes CR MUCH easier.
[16:50:51] <Vivekananda> I understand the need of pushing up master and release and other main branches but would I wish to push my personal work branch too ? Isnt that kind of considered bad in git or something ?
[16:51:00] <duch_kazatel> huh?
[16:51:05] <duch_kazatel> why would that be bad?
[16:51:14] <duch_kazatel> we do it here all the time - because I never merge my own work.
[16:51:22] <duch_kazatel> this is why it's great for teams.
[16:51:46] <duch_kazatel> also showing your workflow is good.
[16:52:00] <duch_kazatel> the PR lets you explain your commit (or commits) in a nice, single package, too.
[16:52:12] <Vivekananda> so who merges your work then ? and suppose I am workinn on a file  A.js  and then I push it up and another person also is working on same file A.js then during merge it will be a biggg mess no ?
[16:52:43] <duch_kazatel> not usually.
[16:52:55] <duch_kazatel> unless you're both working in the same place/on the same feature.
[16:53:50] <duch_kazatel> generally the diff engine is pretty good at figuring it out.
[16:53:54] <Vivekananda> okay suppose one person is working to convert the retrieval fro db to xml from json. I am working on making use of xml to show it up on the front end. Is this kind of workflow possible ?
[16:54:11] <duch_kazatel> sure is.
[16:54:17] <duch_kazatel> we do those kinds of things here all the time.
[16:55:16] <duch_kazatel> the smarter workflow in that case is to do branches of branches - let one dude update the retrieval part, then have another dude write the new rendering stuff.  merge those into an integration branch.
[16:55:18] <Vivekananda> but how do I know what format the xml will be available to me and suppose the supplied method names he gives me are different from what I used. Then wont there be tonnes of conflicts or just red errors when I merge both and a heacache time sorting out what is coming from where ?
[16:55:35] <duch_kazatel> ^^ see what i wrote above.
[16:55:40] <Vivekananda> reading
[16:56:03] <duch_kazatel> there is no system that can solve that particular problem, though.  his work should come before yours in that case.
[16:56:55] <Vivekananda> supposing branches of branches is done  and dude a  is on branch A doing retrieval and  I am doing B and dont know what methods / xml out put etc will come to me when A finishes . The when merging  A  and B into main this can cause conflicts right ?
[16:57:06] <Vivekananda> oo ok
[16:57:07] <Vivekananda> got it
[16:57:45] <Vivekananda> but you have worked in teams so tell me how you solve this in your environment ?
[16:58:06] <duch_kazatel> we tie everything back to our project tracking/management system.
[16:58:29] <Vivekananda> ie a master  MS project or open proj kind of thing ?
[16:58:32] <duch_kazatel> so we'll create a task that is for the feature, and then split it out into subtasks for the different components that will need to be done for that feature.
[16:58:40] <duch_kazatel> we use jira here.
[16:58:55] <duch_kazatel> but i've done similar with gemini, ttp, sharepoint...
[16:59:22] <Vivekananda> oo ok jira then . so supposing task C has predecessors A and B and you have to work on C so you will enjoy 2 days of holiday until A and B guys finish is it ? ;)
[16:59:33] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:00:44] <duch_kazatel> let's say i'm building a site search - let's say we have a design, but we need to build it.  there'd be a task for "site search", then subtasks - one or more for the backend portion, and then one or more for the frontend portion.
[17:00:58] <duch_kazatel> we'd merge the subtasks git branches into that parent task.
[17:01:35] <Vivekananda> okay good
[17:01:41] <Vivekananda> makes sense and logical
[17:01:45] <duch_kazatel> so the backend guys can prep endpoints and stuff for us frontend guys, and then we frontend guys can wrap up the rest of the work while the backend guys go onto other stuff.
[17:01:47] <Vivekananda> so far so good..
[17:03:03] <duch_kazatel> note: that workflow doesn't work everywhere, but it works well here.
[17:03:26] <Vivekananda> okay then coming to the backend guys. When two or more are onto the same task and and task 1 depends on task 2 for the backend then wht does task 2 guy do while task 1 is being taken care of.  conversely what do front end guys do ( you do ) while some task is dependent on backend completion ?
[17:03:34] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: I'm getting Reference Error, options is not defined, for  Plugin.prototype.destroy = function() {  return console.log(options);  };
[17:04:03] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda why is guy 2 working on a project that isn't ready for him? ;)
[17:04:32] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda it's up to the team to figure out how to manage that usually.  sometimes they split work up and agree on how things will connect, or one dude will start before handing off to somebody else.
[17:04:45] <duch_kazatel> we're busy enough that not everybody is working on the same project.
[17:05:13] <Vivekananda> but task allocation always will have dependencies whatever project you join! Btw what is the current proj you are working on ? is it publicly available ?
[17:05:29] <Vivekananda> or any past one ?
[17:05:48] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda i work for a very large ecommerce company.  i haven't revealed where I am to the public yet, but that might change some day :)
[17:05:59] <Vivekananda> lol hahaha
[17:06:10] <Vivekananda> well you must be in europe somewhere
[17:06:12] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[17:06:14] <duch_kazatel> california.
[17:06:28] <duch_kazatel> and sure, but there are always frontend things to don't require any backend work, and vice versa.
[17:06:32] <Vivekananda> but I was just curious to look at work that you have done yourself to guage what else I should invest time in learning and stuff
[17:06:36] <duch_kazatel> we're actually short staffed tbh.
[17:06:46] <Vivekananda> or really !
[17:06:50] <Vivekananda> I am looking for work !
[17:07:00] <duch_kazatel> haha where are you located?
[17:07:03] <Vivekananda> Baltimore
[17:07:20] <Vivekananda> but I would like doing backend and learn while at it
[17:07:32] <duch_kazatel> we're not currently hiring, and you wouldn't like being on our backend team.
[17:07:44] <Vivekananda> why is tht ? bad people lol ?
[17:07:57] <duch_kazatel> not in the slightest.
[17:08:02] <duch_kazatel> they're fucking brilliant.
[17:08:06] <Vivekananda> then too much skill hmmm okay
[17:08:09] <duch_kazatel> but extremely picky about how things are done.
[17:08:17] <Moult> been a while since i've done a lightbox. any recommended jquery plugin to use? just need to pop up an embedded google maps, nothing special.
[17:08:20] <Vivekananda> yes I guessed as much. I am happy to play along and learn though
[17:08:24] <Fernandos> micro optimizations :P
[17:08:25] <duch_kazatel> Moult I like jqmodal
[17:09:01] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos they're very particular about the way things are done and insist on consistency.  there's a decent learning curve but it makes the code MUCH easier to reason about once you get it.
[17:09:33] <Vivekananda> btw would love o know what are some of the areas I should read up more on to be better in stuff
[17:09:59] <duch_kazatel> how long have you been programming/in what languages?
[17:10:05] <duch_kazatel> and what are your goals?
[17:10:24] <Moult> duch_kazatel: looks fun, cool. thanks :)
[17:10:51] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: one thing I wanted to ask is though  I have not done a lot of programming but then not very less too but I find that the coding speed is not improving as fast as I wish it to . How do I do that better  ? any advice. One pull back to it is coz I end up doing new things all the time.  ie php , perl , python, java , ruby ...
[17:10:56] <Vivekananda> heavens knows what else
[17:11:17] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda not sure what you mean.
[17:11:20] <Fernandos> duch_kazatel: Guess you mean coding standards (metrics, circular complexity etc.)
[17:11:32] <duch_kazatel> Fernandos that's part of it, yes.
[17:11:55] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda you mean you feel like you can't type very fast?  or you feel like it takes you a long time to solve problems?
[17:12:31] <Vivekananda> programming for a couple of years now ( like 3 yrs ) but not in terms of lines of codes ie done like 3 -4 decent projects only
[17:12:50] <duch_kazatel> hrm?  i'm very confused by what you mean.
[17:13:11] <Vivekananda> goals hmmm well I would love to know a language better and ways of picking up on the nitty gritty of any toolkit / nauances of a language and stuff
[17:13:29] <Vivekananda> umm okay in simple words.
[17:14:12] <Vivekananda> programming for 3 yrs , not much of projects done. hope to improve the throughput for myself in java and if possible two or three other languages ..
[17:14:27] <duch_kazatel> you want to do stuff for the web?
[17:15:54] <Vivekananda> currently am doing an internship and am doign stuff for the web but I havent invested in learning UI essential stuff eg color combinations and other aesthetic things so I guess I should stick more with core development of web apps or applicatoins in general
[17:16:27] <duch_kazatel> to be fair, i'm not very good at design myself.  I've made my career out of being fantastic with HTML, CSS, and JS.
[17:17:02] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: typing very fast is also a minor issue coz my highest is 70 wpm and would like to have it near 100 or more if possible. But the major one is solving issues and breaking them down and solving each in turn faster
[17:17:18] <duch_kazatel> the former is easy: just start typin' a lot ;)
[17:17:24] <duch_kazatel> the latter is harder and comes with experience.
[17:17:25] <Vivekananda> lol yeah I know
[17:17:48] <duch_kazatel> and even if you want to do just backend, knowing full stack dev is pretty valuable.
[17:18:36] <Fernandos> Vivekananda: simple. get a book about Software Architecture. UI Design & UX Patterns. Then pick a language, fork a project and try to improve while reading a book on that language (not the framework)
[17:18:51] <Vivekananda> hmm but for the latter it is not about solving all the time . A lot of the times I feel I dont know even basics of something eg I forgot how one could do a comparison without using a language built in comparator.  Aside from that would love to learn more on using the correct ways to do something performance wise ( eg you recommended for loop in stead of $each() ) but I did not know that
[17:18:53] <duch_kazatel> even if you never write stuff in the browser, understanding how your stuff will be used by your frontend guys will help you immensely.
[17:19:05] <Fernandos> Also learn about Programming Paradigms and Programming Patterns
[17:19:17] <duch_kazatel> those come from experience.
[17:19:50] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I am hoping to read through eloquent javascript and have heard good things about it all the time
[17:19:55] <duch_kazatel> you just need experience at this point.
[17:20:14] <duch_kazatel> i'd read javascript: the definitive guide and javascript: the good parts.
[17:20:30] <Vivekananda> what about lacking knowledge of some basic things eg  each vs for ? Should I not be expected to know that sort of thing ?
[17:20:44] <duch_kazatel> learn the language, then learn the framework.
[17:20:51] <Vivekananda> I wonder why people have recommended the eloquent book so often to me
[17:21:11] <duch_kazatel> you probably got that rec from the folks in ##javascript.
[17:21:25] <Vivekananda> yes there too but elsewhere too
[17:21:28] <duch_kazatel> some people really like it.
[17:21:48] <duch_kazatel> it's a good book.  but reading doesn't take the place of experienc.e
[17:21:54] <duch_kazatel> peer review is HUGE
[17:22:09] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: precisely and I need that to be better but I am not getting that
[17:22:29] <duch_kazatel> does your company do peer reviews?
[17:22:36] <Vivekananda> wish to get it somehow on a constant basis. I hope someone starts a project and I can work on parts of it
[17:23:01] <Vivekananda> it is a very small one and no it does not
[17:23:19] <Vivekananda> but I thought that such things can be done on the web too ie a collaborative building experience
[17:23:22] <duch_kazatel> they really should.
[17:23:31] <Vivekananda> the only problem is finding mentors and stuff
[17:23:49] <duch_kazatel> peer review will make for better developers.
[17:24:20] <Vivekananda> yes but my question is how to find it online. I assumed it would be possible to do it in a place like irc or something
[17:24:23] <duch_kazatel> you could also build a small project, like a tic tac toe game, and ask people for input.
[17:24:30] <Vivekananda> to do some collaborative work/project or something
[17:24:39] <Vivekananda> I have done that actually
[17:24:53] <Vivekananda> built a POS system ( a basic one )
[17:25:00] <Vivekananda> in python and flask
[17:25:28] <duch_kazatel> keep doing stuff like that.
[17:25:32] <Vivekananda> and hoping soon to build an android application to test on my own phone and perhpaps put out on the store just for kicks
[17:25:45] <sammych> just a shout out for someone who made me look for an all CSS solution to something.
[17:25:59] <sammych> thanks
[17:26:09] <duch_kazatel> sammych oh?
[17:26:12] <Vivekananda> but that is like asking for inputs at the end of the thing. Wouldnt it be better to have more of a modular feedback on something ?
[17:26:35] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda sure.  that's why your company should be using pull requests ;)
[17:26:37] <Vivekananda> sammych: is it faster
[17:26:48] <Vivekananda> lol come on
[17:26:55] <duch_kazatel> dead serious actually.
[17:26:59] <Vivekananda> gimme a way to network with people here
[17:27:06] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda huh?.
[17:27:22] <duch_kazatel> I'm not holding some like secret key or something if that's what you think.
[17:27:53] <duch_kazatel> write code, put it out there, and get feedback.
[17:28:08] <duch_kazatel> finding projects on github and tackling bugs is one way to do that.
[17:28:17] <Vivekananda> I mean irc has tonnes of brilliant people and hopefully some of them would have a little time on their hands or doing a hobby project which can b contributed to. If I can do that then I can learn a lot. The only problem is if I collude with nubes then there is not much of learning there and no guidane
[17:28:39] <duch_kazatel> what you're asking is for somebody else to start a project for you to work on.
[17:28:47] <duch_kazatel> what you need to do is start the project yourself ;)
[17:28:55] <duch_kazatel> or find something currently running.
[17:29:02] <Fernandos> Vivekananda: goto github.com, fork, contribute
[17:29:06] <duch_kazatel> ^^
[17:29:09] <Vivekananda> no what I am asking is ways to find started projects that people look for more people to work on
[17:29:16] <duch_kazatel> github
[17:29:24] <duch_kazatel> ?
[17:29:24] <duch_kazatel> [2014:05:19:17:26:12] <Vivekananda> but that is like asking for inputs at the end of the t
[17:29:27] <duch_kazatel> woops
[17:30:01] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/
[17:30:02] <duch_kazatel> there we go.
[17:30:03] <Vivekananda> github is hugeeee. and who knows if a project creator is actually wiser than me or stupid :( lol jusst saying
[17:30:20] <duch_kazatel> when they have thousands of stars?
[17:30:21] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[17:30:25] <duch_kazatel> find projects you all ready use.
[17:31:08] <duch_kazatel> also: https://github.com/explore
[17:33:40] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: supposing I like a project there and I pick up and branch. Then what u are saying is I write like 5000 lines of code and create something and then ask for feedback ? and then when someone says all this is crap   it not only  1. deters from writing complete 5000 lines again  2.  it is kind of a non helpful comment too coz the view wont be categorical but blanket statement with no help to learning  no ?
[17:34:04] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda if you're writing 5000 lines of code you're doing something very wrong.
[17:34:10] <duch_kazatel> go chek out the commit sizes in ther.e
[17:34:39] <duch_kazatel> and btw: you're making up the mind of the repo maintainers for them.
[17:34:47] <duch_kazatel> this is how you'll get experience; by tring.,
[17:34:49] <duch_kazatel> *trying
[17:34:56] <jphase> also, the projects in /explore are specifically meant to circumvent writing 5000 lines of code btw ;)
[17:35:03] <duch_kazatel> seriously.
[17:35:31] <duch_kazatel> you're basically saying "i don't know what i'm doing" and then saying "but if i do xyz that won't be helpful will it?"
[17:35:57] <jphase> failing is the gateway drug to learning the right way
[17:36:02] <duch_kazatel> 10)%
[17:36:04] <duch_kazatel> *100%
[17:36:10] <Fernandos> there are mailinglists, forums, bug-trackers etc. lurk around "stalk" the project leads and ask your question.
[17:36:26] <duch_kazatel> you will do monumentally idiotic things.
[17:36:32] <duch_kazatel> we all do them from time to time.
[17:36:44] <duch_kazatel> shit, I'm a sr. dev at my company and have done some really stupid shit.
[17:36:50] <jphase> ditto
[17:37:19] <jphase> half the time it takes talking the problem out for the priceless facepalm moment to move forward :D
[17:37:28] <duch_kazatel> exactly - rubber duck problem solving.
[17:37:34] <jphase> yay with the ducky!
[17:37:36] <jphase> duch_kazatel++
[17:37:54] <duch_kazatel> i have a little R2 figure at my desk for that.
[17:37:55] <Vivekananda> no quicker way to see size other than download zip and this one is  107 kb   https://github.com/Double0negative/Survival-Games
[17:38:17] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda you're conflating project size with commit size.
[17:38:25] <circ-user-ZYZHo> y
[17:38:26] <circ-user-ZYZHo> hey
[17:38:28] <duch_kazatel> https://github.com/Double0negative/Survival-Games/commits/master
[17:38:31] <duch_kazatel> check these out, Vivekananda
[17:38:36] <jphase> hi circ-user-ZYZHo
[17:38:37] <duch_kazatel> see how small they are?
[17:39:29] <circ-user-ZYZHo> since .live is depreciated could someone tell me how i can watch the dom for new nodes? i have another script inserting a dom elem i need to hide with my own script?
[17:39:41] <duch_kazatel> circ-user-ZYZHo event delegation with .on()
[17:39:43] <jphase> circ-user-ZYZHo: use .on
[17:39:45] <jphase> doh!
[17:39:51] <duch_kazatel> $('parent').on('event', 'child', function(){});
[17:40:12] <circ-user-ZYZHo> duch_kazatel: yea, i'm aware of on. are you saying .on('live', func){} ?
[17:40:19] * jphase 's slow ass goes back to his OOP project 'cause duch is too fast
[17:40:24] <duch_kazatel> circ-user-ZYZHo no.
[17:40:33] <duch_kazatel> circ-user-ZYZHo which event did you bind to?
[17:40:34] <duch_kazatel> click?
[17:40:48] <duch_kazatel> jphase I did data entry for years - employment ad transcription makes you learn.
[17:41:01] <jphase> me too, I just don't cmd + tab quick enough :(
[17:41:46] <duch_kazatel> cmd+tab?  oh OSX
[17:42:01] <duch_kazatel> circ-user-ZYZHo what was your original binding?
[17:42:02] <circ-user-ZYZHo> duch_kazatel: it's complicated. i'm actually binding to a js media query ~ https://github.com/paulirish/matchMedia.js/blob/master/matchMedia.addListener.js
[17:42:14] <duch_kazatel> what line?
[17:43:06] <duch_kazatel> Circlefusion what was your original code like?
[17:43:26] <Circlefusion> tab-complete fail :-)
[17:43:35] <duch_kazatel> ffff :(
[17:43:42] <duch_kazatel> sorry for the ping!
[17:43:43] <circ-user-ZYZHo> duch_kazatel: hahah
[17:43:47] <duch_kazatel> circ-user-ZYZHo :D
[17:43:52] <Vivekananda> I will check more of it out surely. Though did not find a quick way to look at sizes. Did you mean I should look at code itself to look at size. I am also not sure what the game does but guess will have to download and run it to know
[17:44:11] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda find a project you all ready know and use and go from there.
[17:44:31] <circ-user-ZYZHo> duch_kazatel: probably too complicated to convey here
[17:44:34] <Vivekananda> ummm but I dont use any at the moment !
[17:44:39] <circ-user-ZYZHo> duch_kazatel: i'm just looking for a net really
[17:44:45] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda not even jquery?
[17:44:51] <duch_kazatel> circ-user-ZYZHo you said you were using .live() right?
[17:44:52] <circ-user-ZYZHo> duch_kazatel: what's the best way of watching the dom for new elems?
[17:45:01] <duch_kazatel> circ-user-ZYZHo by using event delegation.
[17:45:24] <circ-user-ZYZHo> duch_kazatel: got a url?
[17:45:28] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/
[17:45:28] <Vivekananda> oo you mean a language project hmmm. But jquery itself would have been developed by advanced people not newbies . wonder if I should jump in there and sink !
[17:45:34] <duch_kazatel> http://api.jquery.com/on/#on-events-selector-data
[17:45:40] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda jquery is not a language.
[17:46:00] <duch_kazatel> circ-user-ZYZHo also: api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[17:46:07] <Vivekananda> I meant a pseudo language too
[17:46:15] <duch_kazatel> jquery isn't a psuedo language, either.
[17:46:37] <Vivekananda> btw I found that I can do this --   foo.innerHTML = '<a href="#" target="_self">Text of A 1.</a> '+                   '<a href="#" onclick="return !!alert(this.innerHTML)">Text of <b>A 2</b>.</a> '+                 '<hr size="1" />'
[17:46:44] <circ-user-ZYZHo> duch_kazatel: thanks
[17:46:49] <duch_kazatel> don't use onclick like that ever Vivekananda
[17:47:23] <Vivekananda> that is an example here --- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/494143/creating-a-new-dom-element-from-an-html-string-using-built-in-dom-methods-or-pro
[17:47:30] <jphase> Vivekananda: also don't use .innerHTML, that's ol 'skewl js - use .html() in jQuery
[17:47:30] <Vivekananda> but why ? what is the issue ?
[17:48:07] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda because onclick munges your logic with your markup.
[17:48:09] <duch_kazatel> which is bad bad bad
[17:49:32] <Vivekananda> hmmm okay but the issue here was that I wanted to find a way to add a long inner node to a  js created Element and this code is doig just that
[17:49:37] <Vivekananda> so guess I can use it
[17:49:54] <duch_kazatel> this is EXACTLY the wrong way to get feedback ;)
[17:49:55] <jphase> Vivekananda: it will "work" but it's not the semantic way
[17:50:07] <duch_kazatel> i told you why you shouldn't and you're going "meh it works though so good enough"
[17:50:08] <duch_kazatel> ;)
[17:50:25] <jphase> let jQuery do the heavy lifting for you - it's what it was made for
[17:50:30] <duch_kazatel> bingo
[17:51:01] <Vivekananda> but as to onclick , recently I created a button and gave it an onclick in the html itself.  The REAson I did that coz otherwise I would have to  1. find the element using js/jquery. give it the function and hope it works each time
[17:51:20] <Vivekananda> and it fails someitmes so I did it as a last resort and not coz of lazyness
[17:51:22] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda right, and what you did was the wrong way to do it.
[17:51:43] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda you need to learn about event bindings and delegation :)
[17:51:47] <jphase> nothing to be ashamed of, just a better/easier/quicker/sexier way to do it is all
[17:51:52] <duch_kazatel> def sexy
[17:51:59] <duch_kazatel> i'm hella sexy with my delegated listeners.
[17:52:31] <Vivekananda> jphase: quicker ? you sure ?  I mean giving the button itself an onclick is Slower than creating + finding + giving+ jquery ?
[17:52:53] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda event binding in javascript (especially with jquery) is pretty fast.
[17:52:57] <jphase> jQuery was literally made to be a wrapper to all the ghetto HTML old js events
[17:53:09] <jphase> a series of quick aliases
[17:53:43] <duch_kazatel>  and what you did was the wrong way to do it.
[17:53:43] <duch_kazatel> [2014:05:19:17:51:42] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda y
[17:53:46] <jphase> also, allows for things like event stacks rather than an onclick attribute that calls a function that calls a series of other functions, etc.
[17:53:50] <duch_kazatel> god i hate mirc
[17:53:53] <duch_kazatel> jsfiddle.net/h5PQA/
[17:53:54] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: I am trying to understand this idea that directly giving an onclick is slower than finding the element and then giving it a click function on load
[17:54:06] <duch_kazatel> Vivekananda stop writing code please.
[17:54:17] <duch_kazatel> you're being argumentative without asking for use cases or anything :)
[17:54:43] <Vivekananda> duch_kazatel: no no I am saying I do not understand it and asking you how that happens ! no arguments . you misinterpreted
[17:54:59] <duch_kazatel> --> http://jsfiddle.net/h5PQA/
[17:55:02] <duch_kazatel> this is pretty easy.
[17:55:13] <duch_kazatel> and the cool thing is it'll work no matter how many a tags I add.
[17:55:46] <jphase> Vivekananda: there are several reasons for using jQuery to bind events - making your HTML not look like a ball of shite, using the event "stack" rather than one single event in a run-on sentence attribute, delegation, etc. etc. etc.
[17:55:50] <duch_kazatel> this is also better because it separates my logic from my presentation.
[17:56:29] <duch_kazatel> brb
[17:57:49] <Vivekananda> jphase: did not understand ' run-on sentence attribute' . Also separating logic from presentation is great , I understand that but wondering how I can make it smooth when debugging coz then I am searching all around for :  where is the code for this button to work ?  where did I write it !!
[17:59:08] <jphase> Vivekananda: well a run-on sentence attribute is using event listeners inside an attribute like: <div onClick="doSomething();var foobar=2;this.innerHTML=foobar;somethingElse();"></div>
[17:59:15] <jphase> ^ ugly
[17:59:31] <Vivekananda> okay got it
[18:00:00] <Vivekananda> and delegation is good or bad ? that was confusing too
[18:00:00] <Fernandos> after a fadeOut() how can I continue running the chained functions only after the transition is finished?
[18:00:02] <jphase> but you can do this all in jQuery and I guarantee it'll be < lines of code and easier to write semantically
[18:00:14] <Fernandos> hmm..stop() is wrong here..
[18:00:23] <jphase> Fernandos: checkout using "promises"
[18:00:50] <jphase> .stop() will stop any other animation from happening prior to calling your fadeOut/fadeIn function
[18:01:07] <jphase> i.e. preventing "spam clicking"
[18:01:08] <Vivekananda> jphase: I would like to have better performance irrespective of lines of code  if I had to choose
[18:01:08] <jphase> ;)
[18:01:17] <Fernandos> I'm running remove() after fadeOut() ^^
[18:01:40] <jphase> Fernandos: it might be easier to just use .animate then and use the callback function
[18:01:41] <Fernandos> but fadeOut().remove() will only remove and not wait for the transition to finish
[18:02:38] <Fernandos> didn't know promises were built into jquery already, looks quite easy :)
[18:02:52] <jphase> Fernandos++;
[18:02:54] <Fernandos> jphase: there aren't monads in jquery yet, right?
[18:02:55] <jphase> they're DOPE!
[18:03:01] <jphase> not that I know of no
[18:03:30] <jphase> Vivekananda: technically speaking, jQuery is a library that creates aliases for native javascript functions... it's not a framework. Therefore, doing things in native javascript will almost always be "faster" if you compare them using jsperf.com for example. However, the milliseconds of difference vs. the time it takes to write one vs. the other is quite often not worth charging your client for the extra time it takes to m
[18:03:30] <jphase> ake something faster by 1/100 of a second
[18:04:06] <Fernandos> lol I know why this didn't work.. $(defaults.className)
[18:04:19] <Fernandos> because className = 'infobar' xD
[18:04:28] <Fernandos> missing dot ^^
[18:05:17] <jphase> Vivekananda: it's a "practical" native javascript library. once you go jQuery you won't go back... it takes a couple of weeks to understand the benefits but you will quickly prefer one over the other
[18:05:41] <jphase> the amount of computation time is not enough to care in 96% of the cases in the real world
[18:05:49] <jphase> if it is... you might as well be using node.js imo
[18:06:14] <jphase> (I know those are totally different and not comparable before anyone corrects me)
[18:06:58] <jphase> but if you're counting nanoseconds, use Objective C, use native javascript, use CSS at every corner. this really isn't the channel for you if that's the case
[18:07:04] <Fernandos> jphase: I don't agree with that, I think understanding the fundamentals before jquery is much more helpful.
[18:07:19] <jphase> well I agree that understanding the fundamentals is important
[18:07:31] <jphase> I strongly suggest learning native js before jQuery
[18:08:18] <Fernandos> Imho javascript can be harder than scala or c, except when written beautifully
[18:08:21] <jphase> but I'm simply speaking in terms of jsperf'ing functions between native js and jQuery - jQuery was coded almost primarily around DOM manipulation at first
[18:08:38] <jphase> well also, not saying node.js > C in performance
[18:08:43] <jphase> that'd just be an uneducated response
[18:09:26] <jphase> just saying if you want to go native js with everything including selecting elements, building DOM nodes dynamically, binding events, and all the things jQuery helps you with, then this channel might not be for those folks
[18:09:31] <jphase> that'd be #javascript
[18:10:35] <jphase> <rant> granted, I'm 30, and have been doing front end js for long enough to appreciate what a blessing jQuery is. I used to do everything in javascript and I now am an avid appreciator of jQuery </rant>
[18:12:29] <Fernandos> uhm.. in coffescript do you say $(this) or $(@) ?
[18:13:42] <Fernandos> jphase: if performance is key, then one should recreate the data-structure the system uses within the program one want's to create.
[18:14:39] <jphase> Fernandos: if you're using a jQuery function like .each in coffeescript it'd still be $(this) I believe
[18:14:45] <Fernandos> jphase: In example: Simply put, ReactJS recreates the DOM and can diff between various state changes, because it was written to embrace the reactive programming paradigm
[18:15:02] <jphase> that's a good point
[18:15:46] <Fernandos> Another example are state-machines, which are actually a reflection of how the system beneath works
[18:16:07] <Fernandos> jphase: thanks
[18:20:03] <jphase> I think understanding jQuery for what it is - a compressed scaffold to native js - is important. That's why backbone, angular, todo, ember, meteor etc. still are in a class of their own
[18:20:12] <jphase> *is important
[18:24:10] <neurotech> Hi all - is there some sort of package manager for jquery plugins? I'm trying to work out how to integrate plugins from the registry i.e. http://plugins.jquery.com/gdb/) into my node application.
[18:25:43] <leobalter> i think the closest is bower, but it's not restricted to jQuery plugins and it doesn't have all the jQuery plugins listed there.
[18:26:26] <neurotech> It seems as though the simplest way is to clone the plugin in a /src dir in the project and then use gulp/grunt to minify etc to a public-facing dir i.e. /public/js
[18:26:35] <__joshua___> These days Im only finding jq useful for delegates, dom construction and a couple of pseudo selectors.  I while I am using jquery promises atm, they are broken and miss the point.
[18:27:52] <jphase> neurotech: you could also create your own npm package:   http://decodize.com/javascript/build-nodejs-npm-installation-package-scratch/
[18:28:04] <jphase> kind of excessive for front-end stuff imo though
[18:28:31] <neurotech> jphase: That's been floating around in my head as a possible appraoch too
[18:28:34] <neurotech> approach*
[18:28:57] <jphase> bower is probably a better option as leobalter mentioned
[18:29:06] <jphase> or some other sub-package "manager"
[18:29:40] <jphase> if you want others to pull from npm creating your own npm package might be the best option though ^
[18:30:00] <Neurexin> When I minify my jquery code it stops working… does anyone have any suggestions for a good tool to use?
[18:30:20] <Vivekananda> jphase about the fast thing I just saw this page and assuming vanilla js is close to js  it is faster --  http://vanilla-js.com/     in speed comparison section
[18:30:39] <neurotech> I might make a 'npm' branch and do that jphase
[18:30:42] <jphase> Neurexin: CodeKit for mac or some other windows minification tool - I'm not familiar with things outside of linux or unix systems :(
[18:30:59] <Neurexin> Great thank you! I’ll try CodeKit!
[18:32:11] <neurotech> wow those vanilla js ops/sec are huge
[18:32:16] <jphase> Vivekananda: looks promising, probably because their function set isn't as intense
[18:32:35] <jphase> lots of folks are using Dojo these days too
[18:33:02] <Fernandos> neurotech: the cleanest way to do this maybe using git submodules instead of bower.
[18:33:21] <jphase> their syntax also looks a little native js + gnarly
[18:33:38] <Neurexin> One more question! Aside from painstakingly checking minified code, what other options are there if it stops working after minification?
[18:34:08] <__joshua___> are you getting errors?
[18:34:16] <__joshua___> and what minification were you using?
[18:34:18] <Fernandos> yeah or writing gulp/grunt/makefiles that do the hairy things for you automatically, like cloning/pulling/fetching from git, making minified js files and copying them into your project dir
[18:35:03] <neurotech> Fernandos: I've been meaning to learn Gulp. I think I'm going to use this problem as an opportunity to learn it
[18:35:05] <Neurexin> Well some of the things I implemented stopped working… I was using a free online tool so perhaps that’s why
[18:35:53] <Fernandos> neurotech: heh, make your gulpfile public on github, I'll check it out, hehe. What's your github handle?
[18:36:03] <neurotech> neurotech
[18:36:13] <neurotech> I don't have a gulpfile for this project yet
[18:36:24] <jphase> Neurexin: I hear good things about http://smallerapp.com/ as well ;)
[18:37:08] <neurotech> I've only built the backend. I'm starting to look into approaches for the front-end that is consuming the backend's data
[18:37:21] <__joshua___> Neurexin: could be.  try uglify1/2 or closure compiler.  careful with semicolon insertion
[18:37:26] <Neurexin> Great, thank you!! I’ll try that too ^_^
[18:37:32] <Fernandos> jphase: there are plenty of these "gimme your money, I'll do it for you" build-systems
[18:37:50] <neurotech> Fernandos: This is the project in question: https://github.com/neurotech/picnic
[18:38:18] <Fernandos> jphase: a free one! http://koala-app.com/
[18:38:35] <jphase> yeah I like Koala too
[18:38:42] <jphase> that's the only one I've used outside of CodeKit tbh
[18:38:45] <Fernandos> I don't use it though :P
[18:38:45] <Neurexin> @__joshua___: Thanks for the tips :) I’m sure I’ll figure it out soon now that I have a direction to work in...
[18:38:52] <neurotech> gulp can minify js, images, etc too
[18:38:57] <neurotech> as can grunt
[18:39:09] <jphase> CodeKit uses grunt and compass and all that :)
[18:39:11] <neurotech> Not sure if a full-blown application is actually necessary.
[18:39:19] <__joshua___> uglify used (probably still does?) separates most statements with commas:  older browsers sometimes only read the first 16k comma seperated statements.
[18:40:47] <Fernandos> whatever, it's all still quite primitive from a system-architects perspectice, these things stupidly apply rules.. // <- is dissatisfied with all build systems
[18:41:30] <neurotech> a git submodule sounds like a good way to go, Fernandos. Linking in the plugins' repo into my /src directory as a submodule makes sense
[18:42:14] <Fernandos> neurotech: yeah, that helps to understand other people what the heck happened with all the dependencies in your repo :)
[18:42:35] <neurotech> What do you mean
[18:43:39] <Fernandos> like when you switch from jquery to microjs or something, people will not only see the minified file, but how you replaced the submodule
[18:43:52] <neurotech> oh, right
[18:44:24] <Fernandos> ie. git log -p --submodule=log would show the whole log
[18:45:39] <neurotech> Cheers
[18:46:13] <Fernandos> neurotech: maybe these git aliases maybe of interest. btw. my little zsh framework -> https://github.com/X4/.X4/blob/myframework/global/aliases/git.zsh
[18:47:24] <Vivekananda> http://jsperf.com/vanilla-vs-dojo
[18:47:32] <Vivekananda> seems well matched
[18:49:03] <__joshua___> not a very good test
[18:49:30] <Fernandos> neurotech: is the repo up already, or were you plannin this?
[18:50:14] <neurotech> My repo? Yeah: https://github.com/neurotech/picnic
[18:51:18] <Fernandos> no gulpfile there thogh
[18:51:40] <neurotech> Yes as I said before I don't have any gulp stuff setup yet.
[18:52:05] <neurotech> All it currently does is pull SQL results out of a DB2 database and updates a local .json file. The next step is to serve that JSON as a consumable endpoint for the front-end to consume
[18:52:38] <Fernandos> neurotech: that would've been much easier with python..
[18:53:00] <neurotech> alas I don't know python
[18:54:02] <Vivekananda> why not good ? __joshua___  ?
[18:54:28] <__joshua___> what were you trying to benchmark?  dogos think wrapper around get by id?
[18:54:41] <Vivekananda> neurotech: not that hard in any language , I did in php
[18:54:49] <Vivekananda> and python.
[18:55:09] <neurotech> Of course
[18:55:25] <neurotech> I just love node and js too much :)
[18:55:37] <Vivekananda> __joshua___: not my benchmark just something I pulled of the web and it gave me a creation of a an element so I thought it would be nice to know
[18:55:47] <__joshua___> http://jsperf.com/jquery-1-7-2-clone-vs-documentfragment-with-innerhtml
[18:56:30] <__joshua___> actually it just gives you the creation of a text node
[19:03:25] <BillCriswell> decx: I can't stop watching Curb.
[19:14:01] <jphase> I can't stop watching Scandal :\
[19:20:32] <BillCriswell> jphase: What's that one all about?
[19:22:40] <jphase> BillCriswell: edge-of-seat drama about some gnarly group of lawyers gone rogue that break the law, have ex-CIA killers/hackers on their team, etc. and take on impossible cases that are highly classified with a very low likelihood to win but seem to always pull it off
[19:22:51] <jphase> not sure how else to put it really, but I'm fully addicted
[19:23:32] <dm7freek> Is $('#foo').fadeIn('slow').animate(...); the same as $('#foo').fadeIn('slow',function(){$('#foo').animate(...);});  ?
[19:24:49] <BillCriswell> jphase: Sounds interesting
[19:28:39] <jphase> dm7freek: no
[19:29:16] <dm7freek> jphase: the former is the same as: $('#foo').fadeIn('slow'); $('#foo').animate(...);   ?
[19:30:03] <axscode> hi guys, if i created .click($(this).after().append("<span class='mybutton'>MyButton</span>")); how can i bind a clicked event/listener on .myButton ?
[19:34:55] <BillCriswell> axscode: Is there actually something in .after() ?
[19:36:35] <axscode> i think its working now ... $(document).on('click', '.myButton', function(){alert('test');}); works
[20:05:59] <legrandin> hey guys! i got a problem with ajax and django
[20:06:38] <legrandin> more with jquery ajax than with django, though
[20:08:04] <legrandin> im trying to post to a url, but it looks like the default ajax settings are for the page im currently on, so it won't accept post calls to that url, only the current one
[20:09:19] <legrandin> is there anyway to change these? no  matter what i put in my JS file it always defaults to the current page and the post fails
[20:16:33] <axscode> hi guys i have a json response, how can i walk through using .each()
[20:20:06] <BillCriswell> axscode: Quickest to just use a for() loop, but you could also use $.each( response, function(item) {});
[20:20:36] <axscode> ah yes $.each
[20:20:38] <axscode> ic thanks
[20:33:31] <axscode> hi guys, how can i filter in .each only object with $(this).und[0]   -->   und[0]
[20:33:53] <BillCriswell> axscode: What is und[0] ?
[20:34:29] <Fernandos> hmm.. why is this coffeescript snippet using jquery proimes wrong?
[20:34:47] <Fernandos> I'm getting: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'fadeIn' of undefined
[20:37:46] <BillCriswell> Fernandos: Not sure how your first question is tied to the error?
[20:40:32] <axscode> BillCriswell: http://oi60.tinypic.com/k9x9ba.jpg <-- this is the data json, wanted to only walk through element with .und[0].value
[20:42:47] <BillCriswell> axscode: So you want to loop through format, safe_values and values or you want access to each of those as you go through?
[20:43:44] <axscode> at least .values
[20:43:47] <axscode> at least value
[20:44:00] <BillCriswell> There's ntohing to loop there. It's a string.
[20:44:57] <BillCriswell> response.field_bl_business_name.und[0].value I think is what you want. Hard time following, though.
[20:45:53] <Fernandos> BillCriswell: ok, I cleaned it up a little http://hastebin.com/anahatofoz.js the problem is that fadeIn appears to be "undefind" and I don't know why
[20:46:50] <__joshua___> Fernandos: the function call or the variable?
[20:47:12] <Fernandos> the variable
[20:47:16] <__joshua___> also, this line $.when(fadeIn, fadeOut).then($infoBar.remove()); is not right
[20:47:30] <axscode> response.field_bl_business_name.und[0].value <-- correct correct but i have lots of field with this format .und[0].value but some variable on .each dont have .und[0].value which i dont need
[20:48:40] <Fernandos> __joshua___: hmm, should the parameter for then() be different, or why?
[20:49:03] <__joshua___> .then($infoBar.fadeOut.bind($infoBar));
[20:49:25] <__joshua___> it should be a function, $infoBar.remove() doesn't return a function
[20:49:36] <BillCriswell> axscode: $.each( response.field_bl_business_name.und, function( und ) { if ( und.value.length ) { /* Do something */ } });
[20:50:15] <BillCriswell> Damn, io domain names are expensice.
[20:54:36] <axscode> how can i detect if var is object or not..
[20:54:49] <snover> have you tried doing any sort of search online
[20:54:53] <snover> before asking that question?
[20:55:05] <Uhkis> `g javascript typeof
[20:55:06] <b-ot> Uhkis: typeof - JavaScript | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof
[20:56:54] <axscode> snover: i did actually, but got confused about jquery object and object is $(this) becomes jquery object?
[21:10:46] <Fernandos> I call Plugin.prototype.destroy = function() {… using this.destroy() right?
[21:21:17] <sammych> so I thought I had a solution to this: I have a content div that sits below a header div. I've got a CSS only solution that makes the content div always fill the remainder of the height of the wrapper
[21:21:54] <ledestin> is there a method like html(), but returning also html for the element being queried?
[21:22:03] <sammych> the solution seems to break down when you want that div to be in overflow, with the rest of the page on none
[21:22:45] <sammych> ledestin: $()[0].outerHTML
[21:22:56] <ledestin> sammych: cool, thanks
[21:23:55] <__joshua___> sammych: its an annoying problem.  if can get away with only modern browsers, flexbox fixes this
[21:24:20] <sammych> ie10 being the minimum for flexbox, right?
[21:24:30] <sammych> the minimum I have to support is ie9
[21:24:42] <__joshua___> then damn.
[21:25:19] <sammych> my current solution only breaks down on mobile though
[21:25:41] <sammych> so I could just engineer it so that the solution only occurs for mobile
[21:25:52] <sammych> as in, mobile gets flex, rest get current
[21:27:27] <sammych> mobile being touch
[21:31:31] <sammych> hmm, flex is interesting
[21:31:40] <sammych> always curious, never had to use it yet
[21:31:56] <sammych> gonna have to leave it for out of work time
[21:42:12] <jaapbadlands> Why would I be getting a "TypeError: jQuery(...).fadeGallery is not a function" when the fadeGallery plugin is quite clearly loaded on my page?
[21:44:08] <aro_> i have a plugin i wrote, but for some reason, when i call it on multiple elements, it isnt reinitializing the default values
[21:44:11] <aro_> any reason why?
[21:47:42] <Uhkis> it might be broken
[21:49:32] <aro> how so
[21:52:09] <sammych> by being not specific enough
[21:53:10] <Uhkis> !paste @ aro
[21:53:12] <b-ot> aro: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[21:55:34] <__joshua___> aro: default values?  are you cloning your default options object?
[22:04:14] <aro> http://jsfiddle.net/bSw27/1/
[22:05:26] <shoky> $.extend({}, defaults, options)
[22:05:46] <aro> k hang on
[22:06:49] <aro> you are a gentleman and a scholar
[22:06:53] <jaapbadlands> I'm loading jQuery onto my page, but there's an external iframe on the page which is loading an earlier version jQuery. My scripts require a later version, is there a way I can specify which version of jquery to use?
[22:07:02] <sflw> Hi guys, I'm trying to work with click() on an anchor tag and I want to do two things: run a named function and also pass an event for preventDefault() and I'm not 100% clear how to do both. Here's my current jQuery code: http://jsfiddle.net/gXb4d/
[22:07:04] <jaapbadlands> or a way to still use the later version on the same page?
[22:08:22] <shoky> sflw: and where would those 3 arguments come from
[22:08:29] <sflw> shoky: They're globals, sorry.
[22:08:36] <shoky> then why are they arguments there
[22:08:42] <sflw> Good question.
[22:08:49] <shoky> event is passed as the first argument to event handlers
[22:09:01] <shoky> named or anonymous
[22:09:26] <sflw> So ditch the globals as arguments and replace it with event?
[22:09:40] <shoky> yuh
[22:09:55] <sflw> Then in the method call it would look like $("#guessButton").click(makeGuess(event));?
[22:09:59] <shoky> no
[22:10:01] <shoky> as it is now
[22:10:05] <sflw> Okay, gotcha.
[22:10:05] <shoky> it's not a method call
[22:10:12] <shoky> that is, you're not calling makeGuess
[22:10:21] <sflw> Oh, it's being passed as an event handler.
[22:10:24] <shoky> yep
[22:10:29] <sflw> Important distinction, thanks.
[22:11:03] <sflw> Woot! Works. Thanks shoky. :)
[22:11:12] <shoky> yay
[22:31:40] <acidjazz> why the hell does nth-child w/ a # not work but even and odd work fine
[23:12:34] <miikkajo> hi, can someone help me with http://jsfiddle.net/rnvVP/1/ , i'm trying to find id of selected li element.

[23:14:30] <miikkajo> var li = $('#uls ul .fileid,.selected');
[23:14:30] <miikkajo> alert(li.attr('id'));

[23:14:52] <miikkajo> well, thats all of it
[23:15:03] <shoky> "selected" ?
[23:15:20] <shoky> oh

[23:16:37] <EGreg> hey guys
[23:16:46] <miikkajo> yes, it was too simple :)
[23:16:48] <miikkajo> thanks
[23:16:50] <EGreg> $("#dashboard_slot").outerWidth(true)
[23:16:50] <EGreg> 613.5
[23:16:50] <EGreg> $("#dashboard_slot").width()
[23:16:52] <EGreg> 1227
[23:16:56] <EGreg> that's so weird!
[23:17:11] <EGreg> how can it be larger?
[23:17:59] <shoky> negative padding/margin maybe?
[23:26:32] <EGreg> oh let me see
[23:26:52] <EGreg> yep you are right
[23:26:56] <EGreg> smart!
[23:57:38] <abishek> how to use the hover function for dynamic controls http://api.jquery.com/hover/
[23:57:54] <Aleksander> Hey, I'm looking for a plugin which would allow to create custom select boxes, grid select boxes, and boxes allowing to open new boxes on click :) The goal is to allow user to click "other" at the end of select menu and open a new one with only flags (grid menu)
[23:58:23] <slax0r> is $(document).on("scroll", "selector", function() {}); not the same as $("selector").scroll(function() {}); ?
