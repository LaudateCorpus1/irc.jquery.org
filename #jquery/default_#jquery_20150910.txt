[00:16:36] <Pazician> Hello everyone, is there any way to "force" an element to be relative to the document, body or the html? I know about .appendTo() but the thing with that is that it'll move my element from the current position in the HTML.
[00:16:54] <Pazician> Something like this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6867244/force-position-absolute-to-be-relative-to-document-not-parent-container
[00:24:42] <Cork> Pazician: you can set position: fixed
[00:25:07] <Cork> but other then that; no absolute will be relative to the closest parent with position: absolute or relateive or fixed
[00:25:11] <Pazician> Cork: I tried, but it's still relating to the article which is position: relative and not to the document
[00:25:24] <Cork> no
[00:25:41] <Cork> fixed doesn't go relative to anything except the closest viewport
[00:25:50] <Cork> if the article is an iframe, then ya that is expected
[00:28:13] <Pazician> Cork: Still acting like before, like nothing happened: http://puu.sh/k6d9E/7f5b8727fb.png
[00:28:34] <Cork> don't send images for debugging
[00:28:37] <Cork> it is pointless
[00:29:02] <Cork> make a jsfiddle reproducing the problem
[00:29:16] <Pazician> Cork: I'll try, hold on
[00:35:11] <dimi1947> w
[00:36:19] <dimi1947> what is the safest way to tell that an ajax request has ended....currently I just use the dev tools network panel to to check that...
[00:42:11] <Cork> dimi1947: the .always callback
[00:44:24] <dimi1947> is this part of the jquery API?
[00:45:43] <dimi1947> Cork are you referring to deferred.always()?
[00:45:57] <Cork> dimi1947: yes
[00:46:29] <Cork> $.ajax().always(function() { console.log('request ended for one reason or another'); })
[00:48:41] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, I changed some of the HTML structure to get it more right... But now I'm wondering how can I find the element, since it's outside the <i> tag now, before it was inside and I guess I need to use $(this) to avoid triggering every "dialog" kinda looking section https://jsfiddle.net/q02heje0/
[00:51:06] <Cork> Pazician: $('project-info').each( ... var projInfo = $('project-info'); makes no sense
[00:51:20] <Cork> why are you grabbing all elements over and over again in a loop?
[00:51:44] <Cork> your binding multiple event handlers to each element
[00:52:45] <Pazician> Cork: As you probably can see, I'm kinda new to all this... How should I write it and why does the .closest() not work?
[00:53:36] <Cork> ok, give me a min to try to clean this up
[00:54:04] <Pazician> Cork: Thank you so much, try to comment out if it's not much to ask so I can understand the code a bit more
[00:54:21] <AdamPDotty> short for clean-up: $.Cork();
[00:55:38] <Cork> Pazician: faClose is that meant to close all project-info or just the on related to the article you clicked it on?
[00:56:16] <Pazician> Cork: faClose is the little "x", it should just close the "dialog"
[00:56:36] <Cork> and what is the dialog?
[00:56:46] <Pazician> Cork: var projInfo = $('.project-info');
[00:56:49] <Cork> you didn't include the css so i only have the elements to go on
[00:57:09] <Pazician> Cork: Oh, sorry - do you want me to include the CSS?
[00:59:55] <Pazician> Cork: Did I miss something, my internet is not working out with me right now
[01:00:05] <Cork> nope, still working
[01:00:14] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, thank you again
[01:08:50] <Cork> Pazician: something like this https://jsfiddle.net/q02heje0/1/
[01:10:57] <Cork> Pazician: stopPropagation is something you should avoid like the plague
[01:11:23] <Cork> cause it makes a statement that you almost never can make
[01:11:45] <Cork> "no one other then me will ever care about this even, for the rest of this pages existence"
[01:12:12] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, thank you so much - could you possibly comment out a bit? Also, what does this anonymous(?) function do? (function() {...
[01:12:27] <Cork> Pazician: it is a scope
[01:12:44] <Cork> it is just so the var open = false becomes private to the functions in there
[01:13:08] <Cork> (as oposite to a globally accessible variable)
[01:13:32] <Cork> line 3-5 is most likely something you don't need
[01:13:45] <Cork> but you didn't include what hid the project-info element
[01:14:14] <Cork> Pazician: if you have questions about what the rest of the code does, just ask
[01:18:25] <Pazician> Cork: Big thanks, much appreciated! All through I do not understand the code to the fully, but if you've some time over you can comment it all out, if it's not much to ask
[01:19:14] <Cork> it is quite simple instead of binding event handlers on each elements, and killing the bubbling of those events
[01:19:41] <Cork> i bind one delegated event handler on document and check for events from .fa-expand (line 13-16)
[01:19:53] <Cork> this is for handling the showing of the dialog
[01:20:21] <Cork> the setTimeout last in that handler is to not close the dialog directly as you open it (cause the top handler would fire directly)
[01:20:51] <Cork> the document wide handle (line 6-13) starts by checking if any dialog is opened
[01:21:04] <Cork> or if the event bubbles from inside the .project-info
[01:21:19] <Cork> if it comes from inside the project-info, but not from .fa-times
[01:21:27] <Cork> exist early from the handler
[01:21:32] <Cork> else fade out all dialogs
[01:22:54] <Pazician> Cork: So basically what (!open || ) means is "if it's open then do this"?
[01:23:06] <Cork> kinda
[01:23:13] <Cork> if it is't open exist early
[01:23:24] <Cork> then the or case is for clicks inside the dialog
[01:24:03] <Pazician> Cork: What does the return; on line 10 do?
[01:24:09] <Cork> if no dialog is open, or the click came from inside project-info and not inside fa-times. Exit early
[01:24:14] <Cork> exit early
[01:24:40] <Cork> you could invert the if case and put all the code inside it, but i prefer to not nest the code deep if i don't have to
[01:25:10] <Pazician> Cork: Hmm... I'm not really following here - what does "exit early" mean? Alright, I understand - it's important to keep it compact and simple, right?
[01:25:27] <Cork> Pazician: it means don't run the code after the if case if the if case is true
[01:25:35] <Cork> "exit the event handler early instead"
[01:26:29] <Cork> Pazician: this might help (function() { return; console.log("this code won't ever run"); })();
[01:26:42] <davetarmac> morning all
[01:27:26] <Pazician> Cork: Aaah, alright - I understand so if it's true it should not run the statement if it's true, but if it's false then run?
[01:27:31] <Pazician> davetarmac: Good morning
[01:27:34] <Cork> yes
[01:27:44] <davetarmac> I'm trying to get review stars to highlight previous scores, but the script I'm using doesn't seem to be working: https://jsfiddle.net/g4cLqhs1/
[01:28:10] <davetarmac> It is highlighting them, but when I click on the third star for instance, only the first one stays selected
[01:28:10] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, thank you so much again! You're a true master ;)
[01:31:11] <Cork> davetarmac: how would the plugin know the previous score?
[01:31:57] <Cork> davetarmac: unless you set the previous scope in the input type="radio" it won't have anywhere to get it from
[01:31:59] <davetarmac> Cork: sorry, I mis-spoke. I meant that if you hover over the 3rd star, 1 and 2 would also highlight
[01:32:10] <Cork> ah
[01:32:19] <Cork> you can't do that with radio buttons
[01:32:28] <davetarmac> then when you click on the third star, 1 and 2 stay highlighted
[01:32:57] <Cork> ah, sorry
[01:33:03] <Cork> i looked at the unstyled code
[01:33:07] <davetarmac> Cork: that's where this plugin comes in: http://www.fyneworks.com/jquery/star-rating/ :)
[01:33:32] <Cork> davetarmac: well the plugin looks a bit broken to me
[01:33:41] <davetarmac> I was afraid of that...
[01:33:49] <davetarmac> Do you happen to know an alternative?
[01:33:59] <Cork> nope
[01:34:09] <Cork> never needed to implement a rating interface
[01:34:34] <Cork> though i get intrigued
[01:34:43] <Cork> i have a feeling this should be doable without js :)
[01:35:41] <davetarmac> I tried implementing a css only method, but because of the markup (it's magento so I don't really want to change too much) it didn't work
[01:36:08] <Cork> ah, ya the html would have to be in a specific order for that to work
[01:36:09] <davetarmac> the css relied on using the sibling selector, but because they're in a table, it didn't work at all
[01:36:24] <Cork> you could solve it by just adding some extra <label> tags though'
[01:36:41] <Cork> hmm
[01:36:42] <Cork> table?
[01:36:55] <Cork> ouch didn't even see that :s
[01:37:04] <Cork> ya, that kinda makes that impossible
[01:37:07] <davetarmac> welcome to my world of pain :)
[01:37:19] <Cork> ya, i know
[01:37:37] <Cork> i managed a drupa site a few years back
[01:37:43] <Cork> and it was this kind of pain all the time
[01:37:57] <Cork> "the markup is crap, but you have to deal with it"
[01:38:33] <Cork> it dosen't even make the rating numbers clickable...
[01:40:17] <Cork> ugg an ids with spaces in them... lovely
[01:42:23] <davetarmac> amazing, isn't it...
[01:46:02] <morphyeys> Hello guys, do you know if there's a plugin similar to this here on the select Date and prices http://www.itaka.pl/en/madeira/hotel-dom-pedro-garajau,FNCDOMG.html?ofr_id=71f6cfd35ccc64bd109a7721847ee942b2f47352f3f333960c2be46b9fbca4ea&adults=2 you can switch between different months
[01:46:47] <damianlilli_> hey there
[01:47:00] <damianlilli_> if i have an external js file
[01:47:11] <damianlilli_> how can i execute it actually
[01:47:35] <damianlilli_> so what do i have to put around the variables and calls ?
[01:47:44] <Cork> damianlilli_: a js resource gets executed when you ask the browser to parse it
[01:48:05] <Cork> so you don't have to put anything around anything
[01:48:25] <Cork> just either do <script src="url"></script>
[01:48:32] <Cork> or $.getScript if it is dynamic
[01:49:33] <damianlilli_> ok ty
[01:51:20] <Cork> davetarmac: just for the fun of it: http://jsfiddle.net/8jq8vpzg/
[01:52:01] <Cork> and is prob how i would do it >_>
[01:52:18] <Cork> with some snacy css styling though >_>
[01:58:53] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/8jq8vpzg/1/
[02:00:01] <Cork> http://jsfiddle.net/8jq8vpzg/2/
[02:00:06] <Cork> there playtime over
[02:00:56] <davetarmac> Cork: what the...?
[02:01:02] <davetarmac> :)
[02:02:49] <davetarmac> Cork: why do you dir="rtl"?
[02:05:17] <davetarmac> I've put the actual markup in to the fiddle, but for some reason it's not working :(
[02:12:31] <davetarmac> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/mks5psnc/1/
[02:15:04] <guessx> davet: you need to mod the css to the new id
[02:16:00] <davetarmac> guessx: new id? I've put the whole div in to the td which should take care of that
[02:16:37] <davetarmac> but I don't think it's going to work at all because there is validation that seems to rely on the table structure :(
[02:27:41] <davetarmac> is there a jQuery way to find all the elements in a table with a certain class that preced the current one
[02:28:12] <davetarmac> for instance, [y][y][x][ ]
[02:28:28] <davetarmac> if I select x, I need to find table cells with a y in them
[02:28:49] <Pazician> Is it possible to write like this? $(document, '.fa-times').on('click', function(e) {...
[02:31:22] <Cork> davetarmac: if you check the rating list is reverted
[02:31:37] <Cork> davetarmac: dir="rtl" is to make it go from 1-5 not 5-1
[02:31:49] <Cork> it is to be able to get the styling correct
[02:32:56] <Cork> davetarmac: you could use +
[02:35:34] <davetarmac> Cork: I'm trying to find a jquery solution so I don't have to knacker the markup too much
[02:36:20] <Cork> davetarmac: could you elaborate on what you mean by class that precedes?
[02:36:44] <Cork> you mean a class that exists on an element that precedes or a class that exist before it in the class string?
[02:40:09] <davetarmac> Cork: what I'm trying to achieve is that if I hover over the third star - which is a span - I need to look up the DOM tree, then down in to each previous td and add a class to the spans therein
[02:40:41] <Cork> davetarmac: no there isn't a clean way to do that
[02:40:49] <davetarmac> Curses.
[02:40:51] <Cork> ah wait sorry i read wrong
[02:40:57] <Cork> yea you can
[02:41:01] <davetarmac> oh cool
[02:41:10] <Cork> the simplest solution i would recommand doing is just set a class on the td
[02:41:29] <Cork> and then you just do td.mark > span
[02:41:31] <Cork> in the css
[02:42:00] <davetarmac> so when I hover over the span, add classes to the parent and previous td?
[02:42:10] <Cork> then all you have to do is $(this).closest('td').prevAll().addClass('mark')
[02:42:16] <Cork> yes
[02:42:21] <Cork> opps
[02:42:30] <Cork> $(this).closest('td').prevAll().addBack().addClass('mark')
[02:42:37] <Cork> (to add it to the td your in too)
[02:43:03] <Cork> it becomes as clean as you can hope to make it
[02:46:32] <davetarmac> that's cool :)
[02:47:22] <davetarmac> that's working now, just need to look at doing the same thing when the radio is checked now
[02:48:10] <Cork> davetarmac: that is even simpler
[02:48:32] <davetarmac> Cork: it is?
[02:49:31] <Cork> hmm actually na :)
[02:50:03] <Cork> $('static parent').on('click', 'input:checkbox', func) is the event you want
[02:50:28] <Cork> davetarmac: also don't forget you need .removeClass to remove if from the tds you don't want it on anymore
[02:50:42] <davetarmac> already taken care of that Cork ;)
[02:50:55] <Cork> anyway afk (lunch)
[02:51:03] <davetarmac> Thanks for the help so far, Cork

[03:11:07] <esko> Hi. Im trying to do a ajax post with a added authorization token to a page that will login the user. It's on a subdomain. But when it completes the login it will redirect me with a 303 (This is the GET right?) Is there any solution on this?. I would like to take the result as html and place it in a div.
[03:11:33] <esko> i think i added every possible CORS header to my nginx
[03:20:22] <davetarmac> got disconnected there... :s
[03:20:35] <JosefDe> Hi guys. How can I pass an html-object with "new Function()"?
[03:20:54] <JosefDe> I can only pass strings within new Function(), but not HTML-objects
[03:24:04] <davetarmac> that rating thing a bit more indepth that I have time for at the moment :(
[03:24:11] <davetarmac> which is a shame really...
[03:28:18] <JosefDe> anyone an idea?
[03:43:22] <YamakasY> when I do some jqeury stuff and get back some OK from my post and my page is just shown as before the post, how should I change the page ? with some get or so ?
[03:43:30] <YamakasY> I use PHP btw
[03:50:34] <joker_89> Hi
[03:50:51] <joker_89> How can i add a new element on the array selector results?
[03:51:31] <joker_89> I am doing something like $(selector).map (...).get ().push ().join () and it fails
[04:10:36] <Cork> joker_89: .add
[04:10:43] <Cork> and it returns the new array
[04:16:06] <davetarmac> Welcome back Cork
[04:16:24] <davetarmac> Got so far but had to put that issue down as spent too long on it :(
[04:16:43] <Cork> it happens
[04:42:54] <morphyeys> hello guys, is there something like on shown?
[04:44:01] <Cork> you mean an event when the element is changed from hide() to show()?
[04:46:05] <YamakasY> can I make sure that firefox/bug doesn't clean my net actions when it refreshes a page ?
[04:46:24] <Cork> YamakasY: what firefox bug?
[04:47:24] <guessx> Cork: firebug
[04:47:39] <taplar> click the cog in the top right corner of the network console
[04:47:47] <taplar> and there is an option to enable persistent logs
[04:47:53] <Cork> ya?
[04:48:13] <Cork> i still don't know of any bug there
[04:48:49] <taplar> i think he was just short handing it
[04:49:32] <Cork> short handling what?
[04:49:53] <taplar> debug, firebug, developer tools, whatever
[04:56:28] <jeffreylevesque> any folks using travis here?
[05:04:00] <YamakasY>  Cork no bug firebug!
[05:04:16] <YamakasY> Cork: yeah think!
[05:04:50] <Cork> YamakasY: uh, those lines makes no sense
[05:27:28] <YamakasY> Cork: they do ;)
[05:27:38] <YamakasY> but maybe not to you :)
[05:28:06] <Cork> Cork no bug firebug is really cryptic
[05:28:36] <Cork> i can guess that you might mean Cork: no, it is a firebut bug
[05:28:43] <Cork> but not sure at all if that is what you mean
[05:31:10] <YamakasY> someone is brainsick ?
[05:31:17] <YamakasY> nvm
[06:02:16] <reaverxai> Hey, bit of a specific question, wondering if anyone here could take a look, I wrote it out on http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32502543/
[06:02:46] <reaverxai> Trying to target a div using query for a userscript for google music and hitting a wall
[06:32:19] <taplar> so your hitting a..... 'sound' barrier?

[06:44:27] <sadmicrowave> yea I can't even find a close button
[06:56:24] <d4nny> hi i was wondering whether anyone had experience with using formspree. It sends a JS object but when i try and parse the data to a html table i get an error saying 'illegal invocation'
[06:56:42] <d4nny> I am also using AngularJS
[06:57:24] <sadmicrowave> can you pastebin the js object and maybe your parsing code?
[07:05:23] <d4nny> well fuck you guys
[07:06:30] <Xatenev> d4nny: lold
[07:09:28] <whoknows> http://pastie.org/private/ypueqe52pxea3cqoykpkma how do i "cut out" the div from ajax's data?
[07:10:28] <whoknows> the div is #cart-form
[07:15:26] <Pazician> Why does this not work on resize, it's either showing all the articles or messing the whole thing up... So annoying, been dealing with this for 2 hours now... https://jsfiddle.net/u41obfub/1/
[07:15:33] <Cork> whoknows: just do ('#card-form').replaceWith($(data).find('#card-form'));
[07:16:37] <Cork> Pazician: why not just use @media ?
[07:16:51] <Pazician> Cork: How do you mean?
[07:17:23] <Cork> well the adding and removing off classes, and the showing and hiding of element can be done with css @media queries
[07:17:34] <Cork> the event handler your adding is trows
[07:17:51] <Cork> you will get one for every resize event whrere width() < 800
[07:17:56] <Cork> and you never remove them
[07:18:10] <Cork> (you should never add event handlers in resize events)
[07:19:03] <Pazician> Cork: How am I supposed to trigger them when a user clicks on the fa-icon to make the section expand? Can you do a demo?
[07:19:26] <Cork> don't have time to make a demo right now
[07:19:33] <sadmicrowave> css3 animations! yay
[07:19:53] <Cork> but you should add the event handler statically
[07:20:01] <Cork> not on every resize event
[07:20:55] <Pazician> Cork: So addClass() should not be inside an resize?
[07:21:11] <Cork> sure it can be, but it is much more efficient to use @media
[07:21:24] <Cork> it is the binding of the click event that is the problem
[07:21:45] <Pazician> Cork: I don't understand, what should I use @media queries for?
[07:22:07] <Cork> Pazician: to add special css rules for when the window is smaller then 800px
[07:22:27] <Cork> Pazician: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries
[07:22:58] <Cork> there is also https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/matchMedia that you can use in js
[07:23:14] <Cork> but you should avoid doing style changes in resize events
[07:23:31] <Cork> as they are lazy triggered, and will be very jiddery cause of it
[07:23:45] <Cork> (it is lazy triggered cause it cause the browser to hang if they take too long)
[07:24:31] <whoknows> $(data).find("#card-form") produces [object object]
[07:25:13] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, as much as I know @media queries was just for styling but, I guess I was wrong - I just don't follow on how to make this happened, since all the sections are showing up when I click on the trigger icon
[07:25:39] <Cork> Pazician: well yes, css is for styling
[07:25:46] <Cork> but your doing style change by removing class names
[07:25:53] <whoknows> $(data).find("#card-form").html() produces undefined
[07:25:55] <whoknows> wtf
[07:26:15] <Cork> whoknows: so $(data).find('#card-form).length == 0
[07:26:48] <sadmicrowave> whoknows, console.log( $(data).find("#card-form") );
[07:26:58] <sadmicrowave> to see what its producing
[07:27:00] <Cork> whoknows: it means 1. there is no #card-form element in there, or 2. it isn't a child element (it is directly in the set)
[07:27:15] <Cork> try $(data).filter('#card-form')
[07:27:26] <Cork> also, don't parse the html to a dom, and then back into html again
[07:27:40] <Cork> just to have the browser parse it to dom again, it is wasteful
[07:27:41] <zumba_ad_> can try-catch capture js exception inside a response from a $.ajax call?
[07:28:06] <Cork> zumba_ad_: sure, but $.ajax already does that
[07:28:13] <zumba_ad_> k
[07:28:21] <zumba_ad_> really wondering why they wrote the code like this
[07:28:30] <zumba_ad_> thank you Cork
[07:28:30] <Cork> it triggers the .error event if it gets an error in the callback
[07:28:39] <zumba_ad_> k
[07:28:52] <zumba_ad_> we are using jsonp
[07:30:42] <whoknows> [prevObject: n.fn.init[93], context: undefined]
[07:30:53] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, my code looks like this now: https://jsfiddle.net/u41obfub/2/
[07:31:24] <Cork> uh
[07:31:34] <Cork> no no, media doesn't trigger the if case as it change...
[07:31:47] <Cork> you need to do that in the resize event
[07:32:02] <Cork> and it was meant to replace the $(window).width() > 800 check...
[07:32:15] <whoknows> btw the data itself produces html
[07:32:36] <Cork> whoknows: yes, but $(data) converts it to dom
[07:32:50] <Pazician> Cork: Ugh, I'm lost here...
[07:33:11] <Cork> Pazician: ok sorry, do it the other way then, i don't have time to teach you right now
[07:33:41] <Pazician> Cork: Alright, I'll try to figure it out on my own - I'll be in touch later if you're still online
[07:33:51] <whoknows> ...so...
[07:34:08] <Cork> whoknows: did you try the filter solution?
[07:34:09] <whoknows> how not to lose it?
[07:34:16] <whoknows> yes i did
[07:34:22] <whoknows> nothing really
[07:34:32] <Cork> then data isn't including the element
[07:35:06] <whoknows> data isicluding a whole page's html (got from ajax)
[07:35:54] <Cork> well if you can't find it with find or filter it isn't there
[07:42:52] <whoknows> i tried this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17024009/how-to-filter-div-in-returned-html-output-through-ajax
[07:43:05] <whoknows> but still dunno about filter/find
[07:43:14] <whoknows> Uncaught TypeError: #card-form is not a function
[07:44:20] <dziegler> whoknows: var $data = $.parseHTML(data); $data.find(':selector').remove();
[07:48:43] <Cork> whoknows: if you could include the data you get as response from the ajax request in a jsfiddle we could help you with it
[07:49:36] <whoknows> i'm getting a html5 page from ajax request (data)
[07:49:59] <Cork> that doesn't help us
[07:51:34] <whoknows> http://pastebin.com/NTNnF0Nv here
[07:51:36] <Shoarua> what's the best way to learn jquery?
[07:51:39] <Uhkis> a marketing page? :-)
[07:51:42] <whoknows> but i'm using bitrix
[07:51:44] <Shoarua> with book or online course?
[07:51:53] <instance> how do I get an element from a jquery mobile listview by index? sometihng like getElementByIndex(3)
[07:52:18] <Uhkis> Shoarua: from our topic: http://try.jquery.com/
[07:52:31] <Shoarua> kk thanks didn't saw it :3
[07:58:33] <whoknows> :(
[08:00:28] <Drewery> what would be a safe split character to use ?
[08:00:43] <Uhkis> depends on the data
[08:00:44] <taplar> what's the context?
[08:01:00] <Drewery> I have an string that I split into array
[08:01:17] <Drewery> but comma will cause problems down the road since I split(",")
[08:01:42] <Uhkis> what's the contents
[08:02:09] <Drewery> mostly strings, wordage and url
[08:02:21] <Drewery> but it can be anything since it is dynamically populated by user input
[08:02:24] <Uhkis> ...
[08:02:29] <Drewery> does it matter?
[08:02:47] <Uhkis> of course it matters
[08:03:11] <Drewery> it can be anything
[08:03:12] <taplar> you need a string that should not occur naturally
[08:03:22] <taplar> or otherwise would be encoded so it would not match
[08:03:26] <Uhkis> does it involve money? don't use currency symbols, does it involve urls? better not use : or /
[08:03:35] <Drewery> given the scenario what would be to safest way to split a string using with
[08:03:42] <taplar> your not restricted to just a single char
[08:03:49] <Drewery> dude I don't have time to go through some troll game
[08:04:11] <Drewery> but thanks for your valuable input bud
[08:05:34] <taplar> you could always encode it and separate with &
[08:12:20] <sadmicrowave> @Drewery you asked for help and they've given you everything you need.  It shouldn't occur naturally by user input or the like, and you aren't limited to a single character.  Other than that, you can probably come up with your own unique split string
[08:13:49] <Drewery> sadmicrowave: I am very much aware of that and I think I am very specific with what I was asking for. I appreciated the input. That's why I specifically choose the word "safest character" in my sentence.
[08:15:14] <Drewery> sadmicrowave: however I don't understand why are you so defensive about it
[08:15:18] <sadmicrowave> but "safest character" is still a relative term to what type of input you are getting
[08:15:30] <sadmicrowave> oh I'm not, just trying to explain that you've got everything you need
[08:16:10] <Drewery> sadmicrowave: "with an open mind" I wanted to see if there is a better practice I could implement
[08:16:21] <sadmicrowave> gotcha, well what have you come up with so far?
[08:16:53] <Drewery> plus I don't really need to confirm with anybody if I got what I needed or not. I think that is just part of the social communication for people taking part to determine.
[08:17:20] <sadmicrowave> ha, ok. well then good day sir
[08:17:35] <taplar> imho safest method is to encode your data to exclude a particular character, and use that that character as the separator.  only way to guarentee a user does not provide that character.  even if they do, it does not matter
[08:18:21] <Drewery> hey, I appreciate that you are being concerned but I thought it came across very defensive like I was mean. No offense.
[08:18:25] <ifohancroft> Is it possible to do something on a checkbox that is being unselected right now? I mean you have three checkboxes, one is checked, when you unselect it (only then, not when you select it) to for example console.log something?
[08:18:39] <sadmicrowave> no worries, its all good
[08:18:49] <taplar> ifohancroft: bind a change event to the checkbox
[08:18:58] <taplar> or click
[08:19:10] <ifohancroft> taplar: won't that execute no matter if I check it or uncheck it?
[08:19:26] <Drewery> taplar , sadmicrowave : thanks
[08:19:32] <taplar> yes, but you can check the state in it if you only want to execute on one of the two
[08:19:49] <ifohancroft> That is what I need then. How do I check the state of it?
[08:20:00] <taplar> $(this).is(':checked')
[08:20:05] <taplar> or :selected, i forget
[08:20:21] <ifohancroft> and it will return false if it's not checked?
[08:20:25] <taplar> yes
[08:20:28] <ifohancroft> awesome
[08:20:30] <ifohancroft> thanks
[08:20:33] <ifohancroft> I'll try it
[08:27:40] <sadmicrowave> @ifohancroft you could also do it in your jquery selector: $("#mycheckbox:checked").click(function(){ console.log( "blah blah blah"); });
[08:27:59] <sadmicrowave> that will only fire when you click on your checkbox and its already checked
[08:27:59] <taplar> what if it started off unchecked
[08:28:26] <sadmicrowave> he said he didn't want anything to happen if it wan't checked and he was clicking it
[08:29:16] <taplar> ok, so it wasn't checked and they check it
[08:29:18] <taplar> and then uncheck it
[08:30:03] <taplar> i think it's a potential hole, though if you did something like that on a delegate, i think you'd have something
[08:32:05] <sadmicrowave> from a css standpoint its solid.  It only fires when checked and the click event occurs.  But I understand your concern, I typically use conditional checking like .is(':checked') as well.  I was just giving another option
[08:36:09] <taplar> this is what i meant http://jsfiddle.net/zLcLamkg/  has both ways
[08:36:20] <taplar> notice the second only works on the one that starts off checked
[08:37:43] <sadmicrowave> yea, good use case.
[08:42:33] <sadmicrowave> looks like the :checked selector is only looking at the initial element state when DOM loads, not the new state of each change
[08:43:05] <taplar> yeah, it's filtering to know what to bind on
[08:43:30] <taplar> its just that for a delegate it's evaluated every time, not for the binding
[08:50:15] <ifohancroft> taplar: This is what I did http://codepen.io/ifohancroft/pen/rOOWbw and it works exactly the way I want it :3 Thank you
[08:50:31] <robertmaxrees> wrong event btw.
[08:50:44] <robertmaxrees> use change :)
[08:50:48] <robertmaxrees> err, changed
[08:50:58] <ifohancroft> instead of click?
[08:51:02] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[08:51:08] <robertmaxrees> wait, no it's change hahaha.
[08:51:16] <taplar> '$(this).is(':checked') == false' could be '!$(this).is(':checked')'
[08:51:28] <robertmaxrees> ^
[08:51:28] <taplar> or maybe even $(this).is(':not:checked')
[08:51:30] <taplar> dunno
[08:51:32] <robertmaxrees> use !
[08:51:35] <taplar> yah
[08:51:36] <robertmaxrees> :not is funky.
[08:51:46] <ifohancroft> taplar: I know about the first and I didn't know I could use :not:checked :D
[08:51:49] <robertmaxrees> also, don't use == unless you're comparing to null or undefined.
[08:51:55] <taplar> that's a guess, dunno if it is valid
[08:52:12] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.  invert the conditional.
[08:52:17] <ifohancroft> Isn't === for bit comparison like in other programming languages and == regular comperison?
[08:52:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[08:52:26] <robertmaxrees> JS is different,.
[08:52:30] <ifohancroft> = for regular and == for bit?
[08:52:32] <robertmaxrees> === is without coercion.
[08:52:37] <robertmaxrees> == is with.
[08:52:42] <robertmaxrees> so 5 == '5' is true.
[08:52:46] <robertmaxrees> 5 === '5' is false.
[08:52:51] <taplar> '1' == 1 => true, '1' === 1 => false
[08:53:11] <ifohancroft> So it is this way in JS as well or here it is = and ==?
[08:53:28] <robertmaxrees> it's == vs ===
[08:53:42] <ifohancroft> ah so you mean I should use ===?
[08:53:45] <robertmaxrees> yes
[08:53:48] <robertmaxrees> except not in this case ;)
[08:54:03] <ifohancroft> Sorry I thought you meant that in JS for the == comparison you use =
[08:54:07] <taplar> no need to compare a boolean to get a boolean result
[08:54:16] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/f8x689b7/
[08:54:20] <robertmaxrees> just do this.
[08:54:28] <robertmaxrees> no need for jquery objects to see if something is checked
[08:55:11] <ifohancroft> Yes I know I can do it that way but I was just testing earlier so I did it whatever way just to see if it will detect the unchecking
[08:55:26] <robertmaxrees> also, invert your logic to test for the truthy case in this instance.
[08:58:39] <taplar> heh, i think that's one of my biggest pet peeves.  dunno how many times i've seen if (something) return true; else return false;
[09:00:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah don't test if === false.
[09:00:04] <robertmaxrees> invert like a gangsta
[09:02:11] <Boogymanx> Hey guys, could anyone tell me why https://dpaste.de/BbT7 doesn't seem to work?
[09:03:44] <taplar> have you console logged anything to make sure you getting in the each?
[09:04:47] <Boogymanx> taplar: I have not, thanks :p
[09:04:54] <taplar> step #1, :)
[09:05:15] <Boogymanx> yeah the rest of the script is full of console.log() I just didn't think of it here
[09:05:16] <Boogymanx> long day
[09:05:34] <Boogymanx> taplar: apparently I'm not getting into the for
[09:06:27] <taplar> so something's up with your selector
[09:07:23] <robertmaxrees> also, use .map() for this.
[09:07:56] <Boogymanx> oh shit
[09:07:59] <Boogymanx> they're closing the office building
[09:08:00] <Boogymanx> gtg
[09:08:25] <taplar> maaan, now i'm curious
[09:08:30] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/c9292cb93e72
[09:08:31] <robertmaxrees> easy stuff
[09:09:43] <anotheryou> hi. How do I find out the type of something? I'm trying to use if i use inArray(), but it never matches, so I guess I compare different types.
[09:09:54] <taplar> typeof element
[09:10:16] <robertmaxrees> generally you don't want type though.
[09:10:48] <anotheryou> robertmaxrees, seems like inArray is strict though
[09:10:59] <anotheryou> thx taplar
[09:11:09] <robertmaxrees> what are youa ctually trying to accomlish?
[09:11:18] <robertmaxrees> because it sounds like you want .indexOf()
[09:11:21] <sadmicrowave> thats what I was about to ask
[09:11:44] <anotheryou> ah. maybe. I just need to know whether my string or number or something is present in in array
[09:11:51] <anotheryou> ~in an
[09:11:57] <robertmaxrees> then .indexOf() is what you want.
[09:12:06] <robertmaxrees> or .some()
[09:12:13] <anotheryou> ok :)
[09:12:28] <sadmicrowave> yea, typeof will just tell you if your variable is a string or bool or something... not if it exists in an array
[09:13:06] <taplar> i figured he was just trying to debug that his passed in element was the right type
[09:13:17] <robertmaxrees> also, typeof sucks because... http://jsfiddle.net/8pft5qzj/
[09:13:31] <taplar> yeah
[09:15:13] <taplar> i discovered the isArray, isFunction, and isPlainObject a few days ago and was like oh ho ho!
[09:15:30] <robertmaxrees> imo you shouldn't need them 90% of the time though.
[09:15:48] <taplar> having trouble find the doc for some() though
[09:15:57] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/some
[09:16:14] <robertmaxrees> .some() and .every() are awesome.
[09:16:15] <anotheryou> hmmm. keep getting a -1. even with indexOf
[09:16:21] <robertmaxrees> anotheryou make a fiddle.
[09:16:45] <anotheryou> robertmaxrees, I'll try :). need to rebuild what ajax does before
[09:16:50] <robertmaxrees> wut
[09:16:57] <robertmaxrees> you're looking in an array for something.
[09:17:05] <robertmaxrees> why are you reconstructing anything ajax related?
[09:23:19] <anotheryou> here: I expect "2", i get "-1". seems to have something to do with the building of my array
[09:23:21] <anotheryou> https://jsfiddle.net/weLouwkx/
[09:23:59] <taplar> uh, is it an issue of string vs number?
[09:24:04] <robertmaxrees> type mismatch
[09:24:10] <taplar> yeah
[09:24:13] <anotheryou> yes :) that's what I guessed
[09:24:22] <robertmaxrees> needle.toString()
[09:24:23] <anotheryou> thats why I asked to find out the type
[09:24:27] <anotheryou> alright :)
[09:24:53] <robertmaxrees> or convert the ID to a number.
[09:24:59] <robertmaxrees> one or the other, depending.
[09:25:21] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/weLouwkx/1/
[09:25:32] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[09:25:36] <anotheryou> works like a charm. thx. string is better, might use letters in the IDs later
[09:25:46] <taplar> so there ya go
[09:25:55] <robertmaxrees> don't use + for implicit type conversion.
[09:25:56] <anotheryou> ty
[09:26:29] <anotheryou> you mean n+"" ?
[09:26:33] <anotheryou> I won't :)
[09:26:33] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[09:27:22] <robertmaxrees> taplar use parseInt() / parseFloat() for that instea.d
[09:27:34] <taplar> awww, i love me some +
[09:27:58] <robertmaxrees> it's confusing and implicit.  be explicit.  if you want a number, use one of the functions made for doing it.
[09:30:49] <taplar> so ready for lunch
[09:31:07] <taplar_food> trail mix only gets you so far
[09:38:31] <taplar_food> yeaaaah, taco salad.  neither a taco, nor salad, but whatever
[10:10:23] <adv_> http://codepen.io/anon/pen/JYYbwp what am i doing wrong here? i'm trying to fix the css in order for the site to be responsive
[10:10:34] <robertmaxrees> try in #css maybe?
[10:50:06] <rogger_h> Hello everyone, i want to make scroll even to know when im at the bottom of my document, my problem comes with resources, listening to scroll event takes alot , i want to know if there is a LESS resouces consuming way
[10:50:16] <rogger_h> im making cordova app so its important
[10:50:46] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[10:51:42] <rogger_h> ?
[10:51:48] <robertmaxrees> sorry, wasn't here for the first part of that.
[10:51:54] <rogger_h>  Hello everyone, i want to make scroll even to know when im at the bottom of my document, my problem comes with resources, listening to scroll event takes alot , i want to know if there is a LESS resouces consuming way
[10:52:12] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're doing and we can give you pointers.
[10:53:18] <rogger_h> http://pastie.org/private/liyraotlsh1zhsehrujtjw
[10:53:43] <rogger_h> i ca not use scroll listener on my app its too much of memory/cpu consuming
[10:53:53] <robertmaxrees> the problem isnt' the listener in this case.
[10:53:59] <robertmaxrees> the problem is you keep calling $()
[10:54:18] <robertmaxrees> and calculating the height.
[10:54:45] <rogger_h> ok
[10:54:46] <robertmaxrees> also, what is getDocumentHeight doing?
[10:54:49] <rogger_h> so what are u suggesting
[10:55:17] <rogger_h> wait kid calling me
[10:56:28] <robertmaxrees> basically, you need to call $(window) once and store that in a var before your handler, then use that var instead of $(window)
[10:57:30] <jG32> how do you have an event listener to an element that is added to the page AFTER load
[10:57:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't - use event delegation instead.
[10:58:02] <jG32> how?
[10:58:06] <robertmaxrees> see http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ and http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events
[10:58:39] <jG32> a simple quick lil example snippet would have definitely suffice.
[10:58:44] <jG32> but thanks
[10:58:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not how we roll here :)
[10:58:55] <Uhkis> when did they add that beta sticker in there :D
[10:59:00] <robertmaxrees> plus understanding the concept is pretty important.
[10:59:37] <Uhkis> i'd say it's very important
[10:59:50] <Uhkis> understanding what you're doing, not the beta sticker :D
[11:00:02] <jG32> i see a bunch of teachers who are great at copy and paste i see. Like stackoverflow. Quick to direct you to another link then just give a simple response. Some people are visual learners, to be honest. but nvm ill look
[11:00:13] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[11:00:19] <robertmaxrees> there are code examples in those links.
[11:00:31] <robertmaxrees> the basic gist is that you bind to a parent element that DOES exist on pageload, and pass a second arg to .on() that's a selector for the element you want, which properly sets context inside the function.
[11:03:29] <robertmaxrees> also, for what it's worth, if you're a visual learner and still struggling, make a fiddle.
[11:03:37] <robertmaxrees> :)
[11:22:30] <ul71m0> hi guys, im using scrollspy to detect user position on screen and based on that im adding some classes to navigation. What i want to do is to take data-attribute from element and add that as a class using .addClass. Scrollspy takes elements ID but i need data-attribute instead of ID. Here is pastie http://pastie.org/10410581
[12:17:45] <zumba_addict_> why do this happen?
[12:17:56] <zumba_addict_> jQuery11020384325254832883_1441917550555 is not a function
[12:18:00] <zumba_addict_> it's a jsonp cll
[12:18:02] <zumba_addict_> call
[12:18:09] <zumba_addict_> it doesn't happen often
[12:34:31] <zumba_addict_> is async: false in jquery jsonp important? it's because sometimes we get js exception error like Uncaught TypeError: jQuery110203843463684832883_144196799555 is not a function
[12:35:01] <taplar> that makes the request synchronous.  should try to avoid it if at all possible
[12:58:12] <robertmaxrees> weeeeee
[13:00:01] <ul71m0> hi guys, im using scrollspy to detect user position on screen and based on that im adding some classes to navigation. What i want to do is to take data-attribute from element and add that as a class using .addClass. Scrollspy takes elements ID but i need data-attribute instead of ID. Here is pastie http://pastie.org/10410581
[13:00:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:00:53] <robertmaxrees> so you mean $(".navigation").addClass(element.id); you want the data-something instead of the ID?
[13:02:53] <robertmaxrees> ul71m0
[13:03:06] <ul71m0> robertmaxrees: correct
[13:03:15] <robertmaxrees> !g jquery data
[13:03:15] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: jQuery.data() | jQuery API Documentation → https://api.jquery.com/jquery.data/
[13:03:20] <robertmaxrees> wrong one.
[13:03:26] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/data/
[13:03:28] <robertmaxrees> use this.
[13:05:47] <ul71m0> robertmaxrees: thanks, i tried this $(".navigation").addClass(element.data( "color" )); but im getting error undefined t.data
[13:05:58] <robertmaxrees> right - .data() is a jquery method.
[13:06:05] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to wrap the element in jquery first.
[13:06:52] <ul71m0> any hint how to do that
[13:07:07] <robertmaxrees> the docs show you how pretty clearly.
[13:07:13] <ul71m0> $( "#mydiv" ).data( "color"); ?
[13:07:24] <robertmaxrees> $(element) would work fine.
[13:07:50] <ul71m0> $(element).data( "color" ); ?
[13:07:56] <robertmaxrees> give it a shot ;)
[13:09:44] <ul71m0> robertmaxrees: $(".navigation").addClass($(element).data( "color" )); looks weird but it works ;)
[13:10:04] <ul71m0> robertmaxrees++
[13:10:08] <ul71m0> thanks :)
[13:10:12] <robertmaxrees> i'd store that in a var first.
[13:10:31] <robertmaxrees> var theColor = $(element).data('color'); $('.navigation').addClass(theColor);
[13:10:49] <ul71m0> thanks, its cleaner way
[13:11:30] <robertmaxrees> much
[13:39:35] <crit_commander> I have an array that my backend returns representing full days on a calendar. I need to find these days so I can do some markup and css changes to represent them correctly I can't figure out a way to do this
[13:39:37] <crit_commander> https://jsfiddle.net/Lo9mnjt8/4/
[13:39:54] <robertmaxrees> hey, i remember this from yesterday?
[13:39:57] <robertmaxrees> what've you tried so far?
[13:40:48] <robertmaxrees> and are you able to modify the markup at all?
[13:42:15] <crit_commander> I messed with the filter thing but I don't think that will work.
[13:42:54] <crit_commander> Unless there is a way to do an indexOf single digits and double digits.
[13:43:25] <robertmaxrees> can you modify the markup?
[13:43:51] <crit_commander> no, because I am never selecting the right ones
[13:44:38] <robertmaxrees> i mean from the server
[13:45:47] <crit_commander> not really because I abstracted pythons HTMLcalendar class to make my custom calendars. I don't actually touch the markup in the backend
[13:46:36] <crit_commander> well i do but I don't. I don't write the table markup but I have ul li's for testing
[13:49:40] <robertmaxrees> ouch.
[13:50:02] <robertmaxrees> i'd grab the first textnode of the TD in that case.
[13:50:05] <robertmaxrees> since that'll be the date.
[13:56:56] <robertmaxrees> make sense?
[13:58:57] <crit_commander> first text node like $(this).text()[0]; ?
[13:59:03] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:59:14] <robertmaxrees> .text() just returns a string.
[13:59:33] <robertmaxrees> .contents().get(0) iirc
[14:00:41] <crit_commander> isn't get an ajax thing?
[14:00:57] <robertmaxrees> that's $.get()
[14:01:03] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/get/
[14:01:07] <robertmaxrees> different method.
[14:01:32] <crit_commander> ah thats some bad namespacing on jquery's part
[14:01:41] <robertmaxrees> eh, not that bad imo.
[14:01:59] <robertmaxrees> load is a bigger offender imo.
[14:02:39] <crit_commander> yeah I remember reading load a while back and thinking this isn't abstraction this is insanity
[14:03:17] <robertmaxrees> i avoid using either one.
[14:03:26] <robertmaxrees> use .on() or $.ajax() imo.
[14:06:36] <crit_commander> wow so $('td').get(val); works perfect haha
[14:06:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:07:06] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense....
[14:07:16] <crit_commander> I know right
[14:07:24] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't use that if i were you.
[14:09:45] <crit_commander> I'm testing it a little I wanna know why it works
[14:10:13] <robertmaxrees> read the source in that case.
[14:16:16] <crit_commander> times like these I really love jQuery
[14:16:55] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[14:32:31] <crit_commander> I never would have suspected .get() to work
[14:33:14] <crit_commander> but it seems that it just returns the DOM nodes I loose all my jQuery methods with it and can't do things like $.replace() or $.before()
[14:34:09] <robertmaxrees> you can use .eq() instead if you want.
[14:34:15] <robertmaxrees> but you just need the text.
[14:57:46] <cjohnson> Can I use $(form).serialize() with non-form objects somehow?
[14:58:08] <cjohnson> I want to serializeObject() first, manipulate the data, and then pass it to .serialize()
[15:00:34] <cjohnson> oh I think I want this: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.param/
[15:02:20] <SmashingX> Im trying to make this form to work, whenever I click on AM button then the input box should be populated with 07:00
[15:02:22] <SmashingX> http://jsfiddle.net/1j7xter3/
[15:02:45] <SmashingX> my problem though I think is this: var strtTimeInpt = popup.find('[name=scheduled_time_window_after]');
[15:03:06] <SmashingX> I don’t think I should be using popup.find, what can I use instead?
[15:07:17] <shoky> SmashingX: i don't see any data-role=popup  element. also that js code is not really valid as is. also don't use onevent attributes :\
[15:08:14] <SmashingX> well how can I change it like it is to make it work
[15:10:13] <SmashingX> shoky: I added data role popup but now I don’t see anything :(http://jsfiddle.net/1j7xter3/1/
[15:10:25] <shoky> umm
[15:10:32] <shoky> why did you add it
[15:10:47] <shoky> why were you looking for a data-role=popup in the first place
[15:11:24] <SmashingX> why?
[15:11:34] <SmashingX> didn’t you tell me that you didn’t see it?
[15:11:41] <SmashingX> I added it then
[15:11:53] <shoky> i told you i don't see it because your code was looking for it
[15:15:46] <shoky> you didn't say why your code was looking for it in the first place. but anyways.. this works, maybe.  http://jsfiddle.net/1j7xter3/2/
[15:15:52] <SmashingX> ok so how can I make it so it doesn’t look for it
[15:16:02] <shoky> you just don't look for it
[15:16:29] <SmashingX> ok hold on
[15:16:42] <SmashingX> in this code I don’t see that you changed data-role=popup
[15:16:48] <SmashingX> I mean you added
[15:16:53] <shoky> what?
[15:17:08] <SmashingX> popup is not even there, how is this working?
[15:17:19] <shoky> i removed it from the code.  i added a <div class="block">  around some other divs
[15:17:23] <shoky> and looking for that instead
[15:17:53] <SmashingX> nice
[15:18:23] <SmashingX> now what I want basically is to make the Early Pick up to change that input box to 5:00
[15:18:38] <shoky> go ahead
[15:18:43] <SmashingX> and even if I click on AM it should be 5:00 if Pick up early is selected
[15:19:05] <SmashingX> well how can I do it with radios
[15:19:10] <SmashingX> I’m pretty newbie
[15:19:28] <shoky> well i'm not really gonna hold your hand and tell you what to do :)
[15:19:43] <shoky> go try, come back in a few hours if you didn't get it ;)
[15:20:01] <shoky> otherwise you'll stay a newbie
[15:20:14] <SmashingX> well that’s why I came
[15:20:21] <SmashingX> to see how can I start on this
[15:20:24] <shoky> ok and you got a little push
[15:20:41] <SmashingX> I’m not saying take my hand and show me but at least something to begin with
[15:20:52] <shoky> you haven't even said what the problem is
[15:20:57] <shoky> or what you've tried that isn't working
[15:21:07] <shoky> you just said "the result needs to be x,y,z"
[15:21:17] <SmashingX> I said it
[15:21:27] <SmashingX> again
[15:21:28] <SmashingX> well how can I do it with radios
[15:21:41] <SmashingX> how can I call a function with radios instead with buttons
[15:21:52] <SmashingX> if is on do this
[15:21:56] <SmashingX> if its off do that
[15:22:21] <shoky> radio buttons have a click event too, better usually to use the "change" event though
[15:22:46] <SmashingX> so I can use change to call a js function
[15:23:26] <shoky> you did it for the click event, it's not any different for the change event.  even though the way you're doing it  (with onclick attribute on the element itself) is a bad way
[15:23:50] <SmashingX> that’s ok
[15:23:51] <shoky> better to put in your code smth like  $('#mybutton').on('click', function(e) {  var btn = $(this); ... })
[15:23:55] <SmashingX> I can live with it
[15:23:59] <shoky> ok
[15:24:24] <SmashingX> ok but how can I know when the button is on certain side
[15:24:40] <shoky> radios have a .checked property
[15:24:54] <shoky> a boolean proprety, true or false based on if it's selected
[15:24:55] <SmashingX> oh like checked on or off?
[15:24:59] <shoky> yep
[15:25:21] <SmashingX> and then I have to checked if is on after I call the JS function correcT?
[15:25:34] <shoky> also might be a way using .value but i don't remember at the moment how
[15:25:48] <shoky> yeah
[15:26:05] <shoky> this.checked
[15:26:13] <shoky> e.g.    if (this.checked) { .. }
[15:26:15] <SmashingX> ok so then I can call it with the onclick event
[15:26:21] <SmashingX> just like the other buttons
[15:26:35] <robertmaxrees> don't use onclick :(
[15:26:36] <robertmaxrees> use .on()
[15:26:44] <shoky> he wants to live with it :(
[15:26:47] <robertmaxrees> what why
[15:26:52] <shoky> <SmashingX> I can live with it
[15:26:52] <SmashingX> I have an ancient version of jquery in my server
[15:26:54] <shoky> :(
[15:26:57] <SmashingX> so I don’t think on works
[15:27:03] <robertmaxrees> then use bind
[15:27:06] <shoky> yep
[15:27:14] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/bind/
[15:27:22] <SmashingX> well I don’t want to refactor all my code
[15:27:28] <SmashingX> I’m focused on this right now
[15:27:34] <robertmaxrees> it'd be a worthwhile refactor to do fwiw.
[15:27:44] <SmashingX> well I can do it over the weekend
[15:29:56] <shoky> btw SmashingX what i said about radios, i have no idea how much of it is applicable to jquery-mobile stuff, havent used it myself
[15:30:26] <SmashingX> I used onclick and look: http://jsfiddle.net/1j7xter3/3/
[15:30:33] <SmashingX> now is not a radio anymore
[15:30:55] <shoky> SmashingX:  onclick="setTimeToPM(this);/>
[15:31:44] <SmashingX> dah
[15:36:25] <SmashingX> where can I get more information about how to handle radios
[15:36:39] <robertmaxrees> radio buttons?  mdn
[15:38:22] <Scriptonaut> hey guys, I have this snippet: $(that).serialize(). I would like to have something like: $(that).find(":input[value!='']").serialize(), however that would exclude textareas and selects, how can I remove the empty values from the serialize method?
[15:38:49] <robertmaxrees> you don't.
[15:38:50] <robertmaxrees> hth
[15:39:04] <robertmaxrees> (but seriously, you can't - you'll have to manually code that out)
[15:39:12] <Scriptonaut> ah, alright
[15:39:14] <Scriptonaut> darn
[15:41:07] <Scriptonaut> there's no way in jquery to select only things that have a non empty string value?
[15:41:18] <robertmaxrees> sure there is.
[15:41:21] <robertmaxrees> filter() is one way.
[15:41:26] <Scriptonaut> ah
[15:45:50] <Scriptonaut> what is the difference between: $(":input") and $("input")
[15:46:06] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[15:46:40] <Scriptonaut> oh wow, so then it is possible right?
[15:46:43] <manners13> hey guys ive got a select that populates from mysql and i use a jquery function to style the select. the problem i have is i use an ajax call to some php to echo the select drop down but the function is already called, how can i make the function get caled again after the ajax request has completed
[15:46:43] <Scriptonaut> ty for the link
[15:47:27] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut oh, i guess serialize can run against specific elements.  thought you had to point it at the form element
[15:47:35] <robertmaxrees> manners13 use .done()
[15:47:43] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().done(yourfunction)
[15:48:02] <Scriptonaut> robertmaxrees: why would $(":input") not return a textarea
[15:48:09] <Scriptonaut> it's returning buttons just fine
[15:48:17] <robertmaxrees> it should just fine.
[15:48:29] <manners13> ok so this is my function $(function(){
[15:48:30] <manners13> 	$("#town").multiselect({
[15:48:30] <manners13>    position: {
[15:48:30] <manners13>       my: 'left bottom',
[15:48:30] <manners13>       at: 'left top'
[15:48:30] <manners13>    }}).multiselectfilter()
[15:48:30] <manners13> });
[15:48:34] <robertmaxrees> manners13 woah
[15:48:36] <manners13> where would i add .done
[15:48:36] <robertmaxrees> nonono
[15:48:42] <robertmaxrees> don't post code in the channel.
[15:48:44] <manners13> sorry im new to all this
[15:48:45] <Scriptonaut> you gotta paste multiliners
[15:48:51] <Scriptonaut> to gist or something
[15:48:51] <manners13> ahh sorry
[15:49:04] <robertmaxrees> yeah - and you want to run multiselect after the ajax has finished?
[15:49:08] <manners13> yes
[15:49:26] <robertmaxrees> put everything there but the document ready in the .done() of the ajax call.
[15:49:49] <manners13> :@
[15:49:56] <manners13> ok now im really confused
[15:50:07] <robertmaxrees> you have an ajax call, right?
[15:50:13] <manners13> yes
[15:50:33] <robertmaxrees> $.ajax().done(funnction() { /* the code you pasted above */ });
[15:52:49] <manners13> and do i need to put that on the ajax page or on the original page
[15:53:00] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[15:53:06] <robertmaxrees> where is that ajax code right now?
[15:53:17] <robertmaxrees> wherever it is, tack on .done(funnction() { /* the code you pasted above */ });
[15:54:29] <manners13> ok let me explain. i have a page that searches candidates they can add a preferred county then i have an ajax call that echos a select back onto the search candidates page only containing towns within the county specified
[15:54:38] <robertmaxrees> great.
[15:54:44] <robertmaxrees> so tack on that .done() to the ajax call.
[15:54:57] <robertmaxrees> make a bpaste or something if you're still confused.
[15:56:52] <Scriptonaut> this is returning elements with value == "", why would that be? $(that).find(':input[value!=""][value!="."]')
[15:57:11] <Scriptonaut> it returns the elements, then I tested their value individually
[15:59:43] <robertmaxrees> ew.
[15:59:56] <robertmaxrees> .find(':input').filter()\
[16:00:06] <Scriptonaut> ok, changed it to that
[16:00:29] <Scriptonaut> .find(":input").filter(':input[value=""]')
[16:00:36] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:00:39] <robertmaxrees> use a functil instead.
[16:00:40] <Scriptonaut> do I even need the :input
[16:00:41] <manners13> right im probably being a complete muppet here but really dont understand as this is a new thing for me https://jsfiddle.net/6nzoyL79/
[16:00:45] <Scriptonaut> a function? alright
[16:00:47] <robertmaxrees> attribute selectors are gross, Scriptonaut
[16:00:54] <Scriptonaut> ok
[16:01:08] <robertmaxrees> manners13 is that your current ajax call?
[16:01:17] <robertmaxrees> like, where's the ajax call you're currently running?
[16:01:37] <robertmaxrees> also, jsfiddle (and javascript, actually) don't use php.
[16:01:42] <Scriptonaut> awesome, that worked, thanks robertmaxrees
[16:02:21] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut .filter() is awesome, especially when you pass it a function that returns true or false based on your own logic.
[16:03:02] <Scriptonaut> ya, will definitely be using this more in the future rather than fumbling with the attribute selectors
[16:03:51] <manners13> https://jsfiddle.net/6nzoyL79/1/
[16:03:58] <manners13> the original call is on there
[16:04:19] <robertmaxrees> oh, you're not using jquery's ajax.
[16:04:23] <robertmaxrees> this is all native JS.
[16:04:41] <robertmaxrees> see the bit where you're doing xmlhttp.onreadystatechange = function() { ?
[16:04:50] <manners13> yup
[16:04:54] <robertmaxrees> that's the callback.
[16:05:00] <crit_commander> can I have an ajax call that upon success makes another ajax call?
[16:05:08] <robertmaxrees> crit_commander yep.
[16:05:20] <robertmaxrees> manners13 put the multiselect call in that callback.
[16:05:38] <crit_commander> is there any penalty for using multiple ajax calls in the same request?
[16:05:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[16:05:51] <robertmaxrees> you mean chaining them like that?
[16:08:21] <manners13> perfect thak you soooo much
[16:31:16] <drkfdr> what does "$(function() { ... }" do exactly?
[16:31:54] <drkfdr> can I just leave that out?
[16:39:37] <robertmaxrees> it's a document ready\
[16:39:46] <robertmaxrees> same thing as $(document).ready()
[16:39:56] <robertmaxrees> and it depends on where your code is in relation to your markup.
[16:50:00] <drkfdr> ah. I just read to the part that was explained.
[16:50:16] <drkfdr> (I was reading http://www.dofactory.com/products/javascript-jquery-design-pattern-framework )
[16:51:00] * drkfdr was a bit confused because there was already a "$(document).ready(function()" below this block xD
[16:51:34] <robertmaxrees> ah
[17:00:05] <drkfdr> hmm... django-pipeline-typescript
[17:01:10] * drkfdr still not sure if we're going to switch to native apps though. still in discussion xD
[17:29:47] <Enissay> Hi guys, given a node X, how can I detect events of it getting more/less childs or having it's dimensions change ?
[17:30:05] <robertmaxrees> mutation observers, but i'd avoid that as much as possibloe.
[17:30:23] <Enissay> yeah, i've read it's not compatible with many navigators
[17:30:35] <Enissay> is that the only way ?
[17:30:38] <robertmaxrees> why do you think you need them?
[17:31:08] <Enissay> do you have steam ?
[17:31:14] <robertmaxrees> i'm aware of it, yes.
[17:31:49] <Enissay> well, during a trade, you can add items (into a div box), and I want to get events from that :-/
[17:32:03] <robertmaxrees> to do what with?
[17:32:24] <Enissay> whenever you add more items aka dimensions change
[17:32:33] <robertmaxrees> are these items you're adding yourself?
[17:32:55] <Enissay> oh, im just creating a greasemonkey scripts to add some enhancements =)
[17:33:31] <Coldblackice> Enissay: awesome! what kind of enhancements? I've been wanting to get into greasemonkey for enhancing things
[17:33:50] <robertmaxrees> Enissay are you trying to respond to you adding/removing things?
[17:34:03] <Enissay> yes, but I use also 3rd perties scripts, so it's not mouse clicks... I can with one click add 1000+ item at once :-/
[17:34:11] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:34:34] <Enissay> sorry, yes, i am adding things
[17:34:49] <robertmaxrees> are you initiating that by clicking something?
[17:34:58] <robertmaxrees> in the window, i mean.
[17:35:00] <arc_> yes
[17:35:11] <Enissay> normally yes
[17:35:24] <robertmaxrees> then bind to the click event.
[17:35:26] <robertmaxrees> problem solved.
[17:36:50] <Enissay> yeah, i tought of that... the problem is that's not clean, but, well, it could do indeed
[17:36:56] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:37:06] <robertmaxrees> it's totally clean.
[17:37:21] <robertmaxrees> watching the dom for mutation events is definitely not clean.
[17:38:22] <Enissay> robertmaxrees, no, I mean that there are many zones where you can click an add items... depending on which, items are added by simple click or double click
[17:38:36] <robertmaxrees> then use delegated listeners to detect for the different events.
[17:39:17] <Enissay> yup, i guess that's the way to go, thaks <3
[17:39:20] <Enissay> thanks*
[17:39:45] <Enissay> Coldblackice, do you know https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamInventoryHelper
[17:40:27] <Enissay> Coldblackice, oh, wait, do you mean enhancements in general or just steam ?
[17:40:48] <robertmaxrees> i think they just meant greasemonkey scripts in general.
[17:43:49] <Enissay> oh, i guess so, well, it's offtopic here but yes, thos scripts are great to add things to pages and make them suit your needs =) ... I use it mainly for steam, but also amazon, and many forums :-)
[18:05:14] <SemiNus> hi

[18:50:45] <acidjazz> jesus
[18:50:58] <acidjazz> you need to wrap those divs in group divs
[18:51:00] <acidjazz> and open/close those
[20:15:58] <arup_r> I am using this Jquery Draggable plugin. I want to do an AJax call after dragging is done? Should I use http://api.jqueryui.com/draggable/#event-stop for that ?
[22:25:13] <claytonzaugg> Not sure where to go, but what channel or anyone here, can I go to get help finding designs or snippets for multiple forms and how to present them?  I want it to look nice, but I could use some inspiration.
[22:30:27] <SirLagz> claytonzaugg: bootstrap forms are pretty
[22:30:42] <claytonzaugg> Any links you can provide?
[22:31:01] <claytonzaugg> I have three different tabs with a crap ton of data to collect on each tab, but I'd like it to be presentable
[22:31:10] <SirLagz> google bootstrap, I forget their website
[22:31:14] <SirLagz> getbootstrap.com?
[22:32:09] <claytonzaugg> Oh, okay just standard old bootstrap.  I have that, I'm just looking for design ideas on how to present a crap ton of form fields without it being overbearing
[22:32:12] <claytonzaugg> thank you though
[22:32:20] <SirLagz> oh right
[22:32:51] <SirLagz> claytonzaugg: some bootstrap tabs would probably help there though lol
[22:32:58] <SirLagz> claytonzaugg: how many form fields are we talking?
[22:33:29] <claytonzaugg> Three tabs with about 20+ on each one
