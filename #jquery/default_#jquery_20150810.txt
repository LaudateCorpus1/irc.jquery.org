[00:15:22] <hellyeah> hey
[00:16:50] <mission712> Sup
[00:17:53] <mission712> So what projects are you ppl working on?
[00:18:32] <mission712> Hello
[00:53:50] <morphyeys> http://pastebin.com/aVhRLGQw the problem now is that the ajax response is returning me 3 results, but it's showing me only 2 of them as a suggestion
[01:27:57] <morphyeys> hello guys, have you ever used typeahead?
[01:28:03] <Azrael_-> hi
[01:29:52] <Azrael_-> i'm creating a new tablew-row like this in a function: "var newRow = $('<td>').append(..... ; return newRow; " and i want to modify the content of the table-cells conditionally based on the classes before returning it. how can i do this?
[01:47:17] <norc> Is there any point to using jQuery.when() with a single ajax call?
[02:01:30] <anom> Hai. Say I have 100 click events on a single page
[02:01:38] <anom> is that going to be noticable on mobile?
[03:14:24] <`ULT> hi!
[03:16:39] <`ULT> I have multiple selectlists. I want the total value (sum) from all the selected options.
[03:17:20] <`ULT> I have made this (working) fiddle. Is this the way to achieve this, or is there a better way?
[03:17:27] <`ULT> https://jsfiddle.net/qq7L6wvc/2/
[03:18:02] <`ULT> Personaly I dont realy like the double .reduce
[03:19:38] <xec> `ULT: what is it for https://jsfiddle.net/qq7L6wvc/3/
[03:19:55] <xec> you still have two loops, probably easier withone
[03:20:44] <xec> `ULT: https://jsfiddle.net/qq7L6wvc/4/
[03:22:14] <`ULT> wauw xec, is it that easy?
[03:22:16] <`ULT> thanks!
[03:23:41] <xec> btw, this is just demo code, it's rather inefficient to run the two selectors each time you click
[03:24:46] <`ULT> yes, maybe better on change?
[03:25:23] <`ULT> I see that you added ,0 on the first fiddle, where is this exactely for?
[03:25:28] <xec> yes, and you don't have to find the selected option, the select element itself has a value property with the correct value
[03:25:47] <xec> `ULT: starting value for the reduce
[03:26:07] <`ULT> by leaving the starting value, i get 111
[03:26:11] <`ULT> without the sum
[03:26:15] <`ULT> can you explain that?
[03:26:20] <`ULT> i dont understand that exactely.
[03:26:39] <xec> that's probably something else (a missing + to convert to number?)
[03:27:30] <xec> or maybe the starting value is an empty string? not sure
[03:27:41] <`ULT> that is possible i think.
[03:27:49] <xec> + is a horribly overloaded operator, as it does three different things :/
[03:28:31] <`ULT> yes, and you don't have to find the selected option, the select element itself has a value property with the correct value
[03:28:45] <`ULT> you mean: #product-options option is enough.
[03:28:58] <xec> no, "#product-options select"
[03:29:57] <xec> $("#product-options option:selected").first().val() is basically the same as $("#product-options select").first().val()
[03:30:26] <xec> (i did .first() just to be explicit)
[03:31:01] <`ULT> 1 moment
[03:31:05] <`ULT> try to understand :p
[03:31:37] <xec> `ULT: https://jsfiddle.net/qq7L6wvc/5/
[03:32:22] <xec> $(this).val() works because the value of the *select element* is the value of the *selected option*
[03:35:22] <xec> `ULT: you also don't need jquery to read the value: http://jsfiddle.net/qq7L6wvc/6/
[03:37:43] <lemonsparrow> this command returns the 5th td child in <tr> $("table tbody tr td:nth-child(5)") now I need to hover over it and click the element when it appears on hover..how can I do this ?
[03:38:48] <xec> lemonsparrow: what do you want to happen when you hover and click, respectively
[03:39:15] <lilalinu_> I have a REST resource, which only returns n results in one request. It sets maxResults and startAt. Can jquery's ajax handle pagination?
[03:39:31] <morphyeys> hello guys, have you ever used typeahead?
[03:40:19] <lemonsparrow> xec, on hover.. a div is build in dom within td and it appears.. there is an action menu that has a button with it.. I need to get access to that button
[03:41:52] <`ULT> thank you xec, everything is clear.
[03:42:09] <`ULT> I try to learn my self jquery. But don`t have experience.
[03:42:21] <`ULT> I think it is better to learn first the basics of javascript
[03:42:50] <xec> absolutely. try googling for "eloquent javascript", great online book with examples
[03:43:34] <`ULT> thank you!
[03:43:41] <lemonsparrow> xec, any idea on it ?
[03:43:47] <xec> lemonsparrow: you can use .hover(in, out) to listen to hover
[03:43:58] <`ULT> that looks great :)
[03:44:17] <xec> lemonsparrow: then, inside the "in" callback you can do $(this).find(selector) to find stuff inside the hovered element
[03:44:24] <`ULT> i will read that definteley
[03:44:32] <lemonsparrow> xec, ok let me try that
[03:44:39] <xec> `ULT: happy reading, good luck :)
[03:48:30] <Guest60> I am searching a web service for creating a documentaion and i didnt remember the name of this service .. does someone know such a service? You can create your own simple documentation with this service and if your project is open source you dont have to pay
[04:03:08] <zoraj> hi guys
[04:05:38] <zoraj> I have some issues using append and $(document).ready(function() {
[04:06:11] <zoraj> I have a button that when I clic, it will append a new input text on the <div>
[04:06:54] <zoraj> but on $document).ready, I have already set the focusout of this input text like this $('input[name^=rate_0]').focusout(function() {
[04:07:25] <zoraj> nothing happens when the input text lost the focus
[04:07:58] <zoraj> fyi, I have two input text with name=rate_0
[04:08:16] <zoraj> first one when I first load the page, the second when I clic on the button
[04:08:29] <zoraj> I hope I was clear ^^
[04:52:46] <morphyeys> how to use a widget in jquery
[05:07:06] <midori-rus> Hello there is it possible to show some divs in queue?
[05:08:27] <taplar> midori-rus: what do you mean a queue?
[05:09:21] <midori-rus> taplar: for example first div showing animated and after it show 100% next div become to show
[05:09:36] <midori-rus> the appearance of the queue
[05:09:36] <taplar> oh
[05:10:07] <taplar> you can use done() on the animated element's deferred or promise to know when it is finished to kick off something else
[05:10:48] <midori-rus> taplar: in each function?
[05:11:07] <midori-rus> there are 5 icons
[05:11:35] <xec> midori-rus: make a simple demo with your attemt, it's easier to explain that way
[05:11:41] <xec> attempt*
[05:12:09] <midori-rus> xec: jsfiddle?
[05:12:22] <taplar> yup
[05:12:54] <midori-rus> ok, wait a minute
[05:17:34] <midori-rus> taplar: xec http://jsfiddle.net/74efdc17/
[05:18:06] <taplar> so what is the desired result?
[05:18:20] <midori-rus> just cant understand how to show on queue
[05:18:28] <midori-rus> taplar: showed all icons
[05:18:37] <midori-rus> first after second after third
[05:18:46] <taplar> your currently selecting all of them at once
[05:19:31] <Whirled> what is the preferred alternative to $(document).ready(function () { });  ?
[05:19:33] <midori-rus> taplar: ok, $('.icons div:first-child').delay(1000).fadeIn(1000); whis will show only one
[05:20:24] <midori-rus> taplar: so I can calculate divs and make for, right?
[05:20:46] <midori-rus> and check in loop if it showed do nothing else show it
[05:24:41] <taplar> midori-rus: you can do it recursively: http://jsfiddle.net/74efdc17/2/
[05:25:03] <taplar> Whirled: you can shorthand with just $(function(){});
[05:25:56] <Whirled> I could have sworn there was another way to do it where you passed the jquery object to the self-executing immediate function (or something like that)
[05:26:12] <Whirled> taplar, thanks for the reply
[05:26:24] <taplar> (function( $ ){})(jQuery);
[05:26:51] <Whirled> that's it. Terrific.
[05:28:46] <taplar> that's an IIFE btw
[05:28:59] <Whirled> lol, I can never remember that.
[05:29:35] <Whirled> what does it stand for again?
[05:29:41] <taplar> i just read an article about it the other day, so still fresh in my mind
[05:30:01] <taplar> immediately invoked functional expression i believe
[05:32:02] <midori-rus> taplar: what is do .promise()?
[05:32:25] <taplar> promise() returns a deferred of the object, which lets you use the done() function
[05:33:04] <taplar> had to do that as apparently fadeIn() does not return an object that is some form of a deferred
[05:33:56] <taplar> so you give it the first element, if it finds it, it does the fade effect and once it's done it gives the same function the next element
[05:34:06] <taplar> so long as their are following elements it will keep doing that for each one
[05:44:57] <xec> taplar, midori-rus: sorry was afk. You don't need promises for this, as .fadeIn() takes a done callback already: http://jsfiddle.net/74efdc17/4/
[05:46:03] <taplar> nice
[05:58:13] <`ULT|food> hi xec
[05:58:37] <`ULT|food> instead of the value, i need now the data-price attribute.
[05:59:02] <`ULT|food> In javascript there is a dataset I see.
[05:59:36] <`ULT|food> Do you know why this is not working? https://jsfiddle.net/qq7L6wvc/7/
[06:03:22] <taplar> you have your data elements on your options, but are trying to reference them on the selects
[06:03:27] <xec> `ULT: yeah, the select will only have the value, not some random data
[06:03:52] <xec> `ULT: you can find it with the old kind of code you had, like "option:selected" then fetch the data from there
[06:04:06] <xec> `ULT: https://jsfiddle.net/qq7L6wvc/8/
[06:04:46] <xec> that said, i don't see why you don't just set "10" etc as the value?
[06:13:42] <Fragus> hi
[06:14:13] <Fragus> anybody knows how to use on change with focusout?
[06:14:46] <taplar> use how?
[06:15:01] <Fragus> basically i want to validate each value user typed after focusout
[06:15:02] <`ULT> xec, taplar, thanks. Some coffee and i will come back.
[06:15:15] <taplar> that would be just change
[06:15:33] <taplar> blur does not mean the value changed
[06:16:08] <`ULT> in the value is already the product_id contained xec
[06:16:13] <xec> Fragus: onchange only triggers when focus is lost by default iirc
[06:16:24] <taplar> yep
[06:16:31] <`ULT> is it better to store the price in value?
[06:16:36] <`ULT> i can change that.
[06:17:03] <xec> `ULT: well, if it's part of a form you're posting, then yes
[06:17:20] <`ULT> why?
[06:17:23] <xec> only the value will be sent by default
[06:17:29] <`ULT> oke yes.
[06:17:45] <`ULT> but is it better to store the price in value than in the data element?
[06:17:56] <`ULT> i need both values
[06:18:01] <`ULT> price and product_id
[06:18:03] <xec> depends entirely on how you're using it and for what
[06:18:35] <`ULT> oke, brb
[06:18:54] <xec> if you're only using the price for display, and server only needs the id in value it should be fine as is
[06:33:39] <Lebbe> i heard jquery 3 is going to change how hide() and show() works in regard to display: none in css
[06:33:44] <Lebbe> is this true?
[06:41:12] <`ULT> yes xec, i need only the price for displaying (javascript/ jquery)
[06:41:33] <xec> then it should be fine :)
[06:41:37] <`ULT> nice, thanks!
[06:42:17] <`ULT> I read already some things in the book you recommended
[06:42:32] <`ULT> very clear book :)
[06:45:50] <Lebbe> i found the relevant blogpost on show/hide in v3.0
[06:50:19] <morphyeys> Hello guys, because of line 11 http://pastebin.com/SQxsfDm1 it's giving me typeerror a is not defined from jQuery whY?
[06:50:26] <Lebbe> jquery 3.0 changes looks awesome
[06:51:03] <Lebbe> especially simplifying show/hide and making deffereds compatible with promises standard
[06:51:37] <mooncup> promises
[06:52:03] <mooncup> and they still feel all so wasted on myself
[06:53:10] <Velveeta> i'm glad they decided to take that leap and make their promises a+ compliant.. i figured it would have to be done eventually, and the longer they waited, the more soon-to-be-broken code would be out there :)
[06:54:22] <Lebbe> I have waited using deferreds at all because of the non-compatibility
[06:54:49] <Lebbe> I'm looking forward to this one!
[06:55:04] <Lebbe> I'll have to update the display: none's in the codebase though
[06:55:14] <Velveeta> i used to use them all over the place, but stopped doing it a little over a year ago, in favor of pulling in something like Q to handle that for me, and more recently, babel and native promises
[07:06:45] <aNewBy> hey guys can someone tell me why when people fetch javascripts they add in the uri ?r=" + Math.random() ?
[07:07:05] <Lebbe> prevent browser caching
[07:07:13] <aNewBy> ooooh
[07:07:22] <aNewBy> thanks for clearing that up!
[07:07:47] <Lebbe> it is usually not a good idea, try keeping a version number in the file name
[07:07:52] <Lebbe> or make a hash based on the file contents
[07:09:59] <aNewBy> hmm
[07:10:37] <aNewBy> you mean instead of generating a random number each time, make a hash and use that one for that specific version each time?
[07:11:03] <aNewBy> i'm guessing so if it's the same version, the browser can cache it, if not, reload it, right ?
[07:11:16] <aNewBy> i mean the reason behind it
[07:11:21] <aNewBy> don't forget, i'm a noob :P
[07:13:02] <Lebbe> yeah
[07:13:15] <aNewBy> ok, thanks, i'll do just that
[07:13:42] <Lebbe> or just use a version number
[07:13:52] <Lebbe> could be fun to see how many iterations the js file have had in itself
[07:14:07] <Lebbe> but could also be cumbersone to maintain if it is a big project
[07:15:30] <taplar> you could probably get that kind of information from git, if you use it
[07:16:38] <aNewBy> i'm not yet at the git level :p
[07:16:42] <aNewBy> still working my way up :)
[07:16:57] <Lebbe> you are an awesome noob paying attention to these details allready :)
[07:17:12] <aNewBy> what can I say, i like learning :p
[07:17:17] <Lebbe> ^5
[07:17:17] <aNewBy> and I'm very curious by nature
[07:18:26] <aNewBy> and luckily for me there's always you guys to help out when I get stuck in a runt :D
[07:18:35] <taplar> runt?
[07:18:40] <aNewBy> so cheers to you
[07:18:46] <taplar> :P
[07:18:49] <aNewBy> get stuck then period :))
[07:19:45] <taplar> being stuck is when you have the most fun
[07:19:50] <taplar> cause you try all the crazy stuff
[07:20:16] <aNewBy> The meaning of "stuck in a rut" is:
[07:20:16] <aNewBy> (idiom) in a boring lifestyle that never changes - darn... gotta work on my english :)))) i thought it meant something else :)))
[07:20:24] <aNewBy> and sorry for the lines ... darn
[07:20:34] <kaybee> aNewBy: git should be one of the first things you learn!
[07:20:43] <kaybee> start that early early
[07:20:44] <aNewBy> taplar: you're absolutely right! i know the feeling
[07:21:27] <aNewBy> kaybee: yep, it's on my todo list this week
[07:21:52] <kaybee> everyone who waited wishes they didn't :)
[07:22:01] <kaybee> version control is a really critical piece of development
[07:22:03] <aNewBy> believe me i know what you mean :D
[07:22:09] <aNewBy> especially version control!
[07:22:43] <taplar> and the whole 'should i keep this?  i might need it later but not now...' goes away.  just throw it away, its available in history
[07:23:51] <aNewBy> oooh i know that feeling too :)) also the "darn... why did I delete it??!?!!" :)))
[07:24:09] <aNewBy> so yea, git is a must
[07:36:05] <aNewBy> so.. got another question for you guys :)
[07:36:26] <aNewBy> but it's more related to js scopes than to jquery specifically... asked it in js channel but no luck ... maybe you can help out :p
[07:36:27] <taplar> we can't be girls?
[07:36:28] <aNewBy> if I've got var Utils = { loadJQuery: function() { eval(this.loadURL(jqueryURL, "GET", "?r=" + Math.random())); } } ... and I call this from another object jQuery will be available only for that object right ? so if I've got  var Example = { init: function() { Utils.loadJquery() } } then $ and jQuery will be available only there, right? i'm a noob.
[07:36:28] <aNewBy> .. trying to get my head around scopes right....
[07:36:28] <taplar> wow
[07:36:37] <aNewBy> taplar: even better :d
[07:36:40] <taplar> woah, put it in a fiddle
[07:37:19] <aNewBy> well i'm thinking that as it's a scope problem, it should be fine with theory :D
[07:37:54] <taplar> just in general, any sizable code, or many line code, put it in a fiddle or jsbin.  much easier to read
[07:38:02] <aNewBy> it's for a scripting thing, not a website
[07:38:58] <taplar> also try to avoid eval()
[07:39:03] <aNewBy> taplar: right, but a little lazy and don't know, but i really have a feeling that it's a very easy and (stupid for me) question ...
[07:39:44] <aNewBy> i need to load jquery using XMLHttpRequest request, can I get it working without eval ?
[07:40:07] <aNewBy> i mean, is there another way?
[07:40:40] <taplar> i *think* you could dynamically add it's script tag to the body
[07:40:55] <taplar> but why do you want to do that?
[07:41:00] <aNewBy> tried that, but can't access them
[07:41:06] <aNewBy> when I do window.$ i get undefined
[07:41:14] <aNewBy> but when I use my little trick, it works
[07:41:29] <taplar> why wouldn't you just include it on the page?
[07:41:36] <aNewBy> the problem is that when the page changes, I lose jquery and I need to load it again
[07:41:48] <taplar> ok?
[07:42:00] <aNewBy> coz it's a script to change webpages from the outside
[07:42:11] <taplar> the browser will cache stuff like that
[07:42:27] <aNewBy> it's something like greasemonkey
[07:42:33] <taplar> doesn't matter
[07:42:49] <taplar> you can check your network tab, after the first time, repeated attempts will usually return a 304
[07:42:54] <aNewBy> well most pages already have jquery included but I can't get access to it
[07:44:01] <aNewBy> hmm
[07:44:04] <aNewBy> let me check it out
[07:47:02] <aNewBy> has anyone from here used greasemonkey or something similar?
[07:47:09] <aNewBy> guys & girls :)
[07:47:26] <taplar> i have a bit
[07:47:48] <taplar> the site i was targeting though didn't have jQuery included on it though
[07:48:17] <aNewBy> well these days most have but I can't access it :(
[07:48:18] <aNewBy> TypeError: window.$ is not a function
[07:48:23] <taplar> i just included the min file contents at the start of my script
[07:48:24] <aNewBy> but when I do in the console, it works
[07:49:01] <aNewBy> actually I'm doing something to be able to load scripts dynamically, depending on what I need :)
[07:49:23] <taplar> what about window['jQuery'] ?
[07:49:30] <aNewBy> lemme try
[07:50:13] <aNewBy> now i'm getting ReferenceError: $ is not defined
[07:50:23] <aNewBy> brb while I check the diff between typeerror and ref error exactly
[07:50:49] <taplar> ok.... what about.... var $ = window['jQuery']; ?
[07:52:19] <aNewBy> w8
[07:52:23] <aNewBy> checking
[07:54:00] <aNewBy> ok, i'm stupid... what am I doing wrong here: var $ = window['jQuery']; $('body').html('holy shit it worked');
[07:54:19] <aNewBy> so that worked in the console, but in my script nope
[07:54:29] <xec> aNewBy: maybe your code runs before jquery is loaded?
[07:54:33] <aNewBy> SyntaxError: missing name after . operator
[07:54:36] <taplar> ^ i'm wondering that
[07:54:48] <aNewBy> hmm
[07:54:51] <taplar> try wrapping your logic in a setTimeout
[07:55:07] <hlvwrk> Hi
[07:55:18] <taplar> i thought greasemonkey executed it's scripts after the page loads, but maybe that doesn't include the scripts
[07:55:53] <aNewBy> trying it
[07:57:25] <aNewBy> well I can run the scripts even after the page finished loading, so jquery should be available
[07:57:35] <aNewBy> i'm trying with addeventlistener for load to see if it works
[07:57:44] <aNewBy> this way i know for sure the document is loaded
[07:58:16] <aNewBy> !paste
[07:58:28] <aNewBy> !paste

[08:00:04] <aNewBy> is this code right (theoretically) ?
[08:00:18] <aNewBy> coz it's not working, but i'm thinking maybe i messed something up being a noob & all ..
[08:01:57] <taplar> brb
[08:03:30] <taplar> made me add greasemonkey to my ff, :P
[08:04:29] <aNewBy> darn, coz i'm using imacros not greasemonkey :D it's a different testing tool
[08:04:50] <aNewBy> don't know how to target urls correctly with greasemonkey and some other stuff
[08:05:11] <taplar> well, targeting my greasemonkey at jquery.com, it has access to jQuery in the script
[08:05:12] <aNewBy> coz i need to go to multiple pages and complete forms and log the errors and so on
[08:05:46] <taplar> one or many window/tabs?
[08:05:53] <aNewBy> many
[08:06:00] <aNewBy> i hate testing :(
[08:06:17] <taplar> by that i mean many simultaneously, or are you reusing one?
[08:06:29] <aNewBy> many simultaneously
[08:06:34] <taplar> boo
[08:06:36] <taplar> lol
[08:06:49] <aNewBy> yep :d
[08:07:05] <aNewBy> so... jquery? :d]
[08:07:51] <taplar> oh, you gotta be freakin kidding me.  installing greasemonkey reset my default search engine, -_-
[08:08:14] <taplar> that's retarded
[08:08:45] <aNewBy> that's what you get for trying to help out
[08:08:51] <aNewBy> learn from this :d
[08:09:14] <aNewBy> and next time just stick to theory :)))) j/k
[08:11:46] <taplar> ok, actually that's fine
[08:12:00] <taplar> you might try looking into using localStorage.
[08:12:16] <taplar> i was under the impression that it would be deleted when a browser closed, but apparently that's not the case
[08:13:21] <taplar> so in your scripts what you might could do is...
[08:14:04] <aNewBy> yes.. ?
[08:14:37] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/hu64yy8x/
[08:14:46] <aNewBy> load all the scripts at the start and then put them into localStorage and access them whenever I need them ?
[08:15:06] <aNewBy> hmm
[08:15:11] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/hu64yy8x/1/
[08:15:12] <aNewBy> and how do I set the context?
[08:15:13] <taplar> had my set wrong
[08:15:38] <aNewBy> hmm i think that might actually work
[08:16:11] <aNewBy> and when I get them from storage i use something like window.$ = function(select){ return window.jQuery(select, content.document); }; to set the context, right ?
[08:16:43] <taplar> nope, that assignment to $ would make it available every where, just like it is normally
[08:16:51] <taplar> so long as that was a top level statement
[08:16:53] <aNewBy> :o
[08:17:10] <aNewBy> lemme try sounds promising
[08:17:58] <chrispg21> when passing .on a function name instead of a self invoking function how do i get access to the event?
[08:18:16] <taplar> your function would have to have the event on it's parameter list
[08:18:17] <chrispg21> firefox doesnt like event.which
[08:19:26] <taplar_> silly network
[08:19:37] <taplar_> and that's not a self-invoking function.  the on calls it
[08:20:22] <taplar> your thinking of an anonymous function
[08:21:10] <chrispg21> taplar: right
[08:21:28] <chrispg21> still cant get firefox to see the event
[08:21:35] <taplar> fiddle?
[08:22:07] <aNewBy> taplar: but i'm gonna always call jquery from something like http://jsfiddle.net/03rdes75/ what will that do to the scope? will $ still work everywhere?
[08:22:40] <taplar> aNewBy: no, you'd need to do that outside of any closures
[08:22:47] <taplar> or take the 'var' off
[08:24:00] <taplar> or window['$'] = localStorage...... possibly
[08:24:00] <aNewBy> taplar: ok, trying it now, thanks for all your help :)
[08:24:33] <aNewBy> and window['$']  will work with both selectors and functions like $.each and so on, right ? remember, noob here :d
[08:25:06] <taplar> doing the assignment with the window would definately make it global
[08:25:35] <aNewBy> nice
[08:26:00] <taplar> var restricts scope, so taking it off should do the same thing
[08:26:15] <taplar> but writing it using the window is a bit more explicit that you meant to do that, instead of forgetting the var, :)
[08:27:06] <taplar> clear
[08:27:11] <taplar> sorry, wrong window
[08:38:33] <chrispg21> taplar: i found the issue as I was making the fiddle for you :) thanks
[08:38:41] <taplar> :D
[08:38:44] <robertmaxrees> boom!
[08:39:09] <taplar> the best present never given
[08:44:37] <aNewBy> var window[$] = window.localStorage.getItem('jQuery');
[08:44:38] <aNewBy>  - it says SyntaxError: missing ; before statement, line  - why?? i clearned everything and left just that and still i get it
[08:45:19] <robertmaxrees>  window[$]
[08:45:21] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid.
[08:45:38] <robertmaxrees> that's also a really strange thing to want to do - what's the story?
[08:45:40] <taplar> gotta '$' it
[08:46:04] <robertmaxrees> please don't tell me you're trying to store jquery within localStorage.
[08:46:23] <taplar> he's doing something strange with testing
[08:46:35] <taplar> and his testing app can't get reference to the jquery included on the page
[08:46:58] <aNewBy> robertmaxrees:  ok, i won't :))
[08:47:17] <aNewBy> taplar: thanks for taking the time to explain :p
[08:47:23] <aNewBy> very nice of you
[08:47:27] <taplar> lol, 2 lines, :P
[08:47:48] <robertmaxrees> so it'd be window['$'] or window.$
[08:47:57] <aNewBy> window['$'] = window.localStorage.getItem('jQuery'); window['$']('body').html('holy shit it worked!'); - and TypeError: window.$ is not  func
[08:48:20] <aNewBy> robertmaxrees: actually yea, it was my mistake, taplar said window['$'] but i didn't see the '' ...
[08:48:23] <robertmaxrees> localStorage stores things as strings.
[08:48:32] <aNewBy> yea thought i might do eval firt
[08:48:35] <aNewBy> first*
[08:48:51] <robertmaxrees> hello perf train!
[08:49:21] <aNewBy> window['$'] = eval(window.localStorage.getItem('jQuery')); - right? still not working ..
[08:49:47] <robertmaxrees> how are you pushing it into localStorage?
[08:49:51] <robertmaxrees> because that makes a difference.
[08:49:52] <taplar> no, the actual variable would be in the localStorage
[08:49:58] <taplar> no need to eval taht
[08:50:18] <robertmaxrees> taplar localStorage just stores strings iirc.
[08:50:26] <taplar> crap
[08:50:31] <taplar> well there goes that idea
[08:50:49] <aNewBy> var jQuery = loadJScode("http://localhost/jq/iJquery.js");
[08:50:49] <aNewBy>  // loadJScode returns text
[08:50:52] <aNewBy> string sry :)
[08:50:56] <robertmaxrees> that could be wrong though.
[08:51:00] <aNewBy> gotta keep up with the lingo :)
[08:53:01] <taplar> i think you said it earlier, but i got disconnected.  what testing app did you say your using?
[08:53:12] <robertmaxrees> is this for unit testing or what?
[08:53:16] <aNewBy> imacros
[08:53:32] <taplar> i'm assuming/hoping it's functional tests
[08:53:37] <robertmaxrees> that... doesn't look like a testing product.
[08:53:42] <robertmaxrees> that looks like an automation product.
[08:53:50] <aNewBy> that's what I gotta use :(
[08:53:56] <aNewBy> it's not my choice
[08:54:13] <robertmaxrees> wat
[08:54:17] <taplar> there website is dead, nice
[08:54:38] <robertmaxrees> you want selenium, not some kind of automation software :(
[08:54:56] <aNewBy> it's not up to me unfortunately ...
[08:55:03] <robertmaxrees> i know, just crazy.
[08:55:10] <aNewBy> i'm stuck with this piece of s*** :(
[08:55:17] <robertmaxrees> either way, what browsers do you need to support?  and what kinds of things are you doing with it?
[08:55:17] <aNewBy> been banging my head for 3 days now
[08:55:25] <robertmaxrees> because adding jquery into the mix may not be the best solution.
[08:56:27] <aNewBy> it would make things a lot easier for me if i could add jquery
[08:56:38] <robertmaxrees> what browsers ae you testing?
[08:56:38] <aNewBy> otherwise i'm stuck only with this crap :|
[08:56:41] <taplar> i'm not sure that jquery will fix your issue
[08:56:47] <aNewBy> firefox mainly
[08:56:50] <robertmaxrees> and what kinds of functionality are you going to rely on it for?
[08:57:01] <robertmaxrees> like, a semi-modern copy of FF?
[08:57:13] <taplar> according to this one post i'm reading it seems imacros operates in a different scope than the page
[08:57:27] <aNewBy> taplar: yep, that's why i need to use window. every time
[08:57:49] <aNewBy> hmm
[08:57:51] <robertmaxrees> aNewBy so what kinds of things are you looking to jQuery for?  Is it the selectors?
[08:57:54] <robertmaxrees> or what?
[08:58:16] <aNewBy> robertmaxrees: selectors, ajax, jquery, .each, actually most of the functionally jquery has
[08:58:26] <aNewBy> i'm used to working with it a little
[08:58:27] <robertmaxrees> i thought you said you were testing.
[08:58:34] <aNewBy> yea
[08:58:35] <robertmaxrees> why are you running ajax while testing?
[08:58:39] <taplar> ^
[08:58:40] <aNewBy> to post logs
[08:58:46] <aNewBy> when i get errors
[08:58:54] <aNewBy> and check availability
[08:58:56] <robertmaxrees> just use the tools built into the browser.
[08:58:58] <aNewBy> stupid stuff
[08:59:07] <robertmaxrees> all of that's really easy with vanilla on relatively modern browsers.
[08:59:46] <aNewBy> robertmaxrees: that's if i knew javascript THAT GOOD :)
[08:59:52] <robertmaxrees> it's really easy.
[08:59:55] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[08:59:55] <aNewBy> but i get stuck with a lot of the error handling and so on
[09:00:05] <robertmaxrees> jquery doesn't add anything for error handling fwiw.
[09:00:24] <aNewBy> for exmaple i had to make my own _request and _post and _get which are very stupid implemented but ... works, but i don't like it
[09:01:02] <aNewBy> whenever i try to get some script working with vanilla js, i'm getting a lot of errors (remember... noob here) but with jquery is very smooth
[09:01:20] <aNewBy> anyway, my stupid boss wants me to use this s**t ...
[09:01:21] <robertmaxrees> using jquery is the wrong solution here.
[09:01:31] <aNewBy> tried to tell him to try something else, but ...
[09:01:38] <robertmaxrees> especially because it's a dependency that you shouldn't rely on while testing.
[09:02:04] <aNewBy> actually including jquery was my own little trick, coz my boss wanted me to only use imacros which really sucks!
[09:02:25] <robertmaxrees> right - i'm letting you know that's not a very good idea in this case :)
[09:02:31] <aNewBy> i don't know why he's so adamant about that....
[09:02:39] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/1wm5t060/1/
[09:02:43] <aNewBy> robertmaxrees: i'm not arguing that :P
[09:02:56] <robertmaxrees> because your company has already invested a bunch of time and effort into that particular tool.
[09:03:21] <aNewBy> robertmaxrees: i hate you, stop making it look so easy :)))
[09:03:26] <robertmaxrees> it IS easy :)
[09:03:29] <robertmaxrees> you just need to learn.
[09:03:46] <taplar> fortunately this room and #javascript exist, :)
[09:04:11] <aNewBy> yes, but i was sooo used to jquery :(
[09:04:22] <robertmaxrees> document.querySelectorAll() is your new $().  you have to do some manual work yourself (make sure you're not about to operate against something that doesn't exist, for instance) but it's worth it in the long run.
[09:04:25] <aNewBy> to be honest, until jquery came along, i didn't touch js :$
[09:04:35] <aNewBy> found it too hard
[09:04:53] <aNewBy> hmm
[09:04:58] <taplar> eh, just a bit more time googling is all
[09:04:59] <robertmaxrees> the old way of doing things was rough, but modern browsers are MUCH better.
[09:05:20] <aNewBy> really?
[09:05:23] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[09:05:25] <aNewBy> hmm then i should update myself
[09:05:36] <robertmaxrees> MDN is a fantastic resource, and good google-fu will get you pretty far.
[09:05:49] <aNewBy> yea that much i know :P
[09:05:50] <robertmaxrees> it's not even JS that most people have an issue with - it's the DOM APIs.
[09:06:08] <aNewBy> what do you mean ?
[09:06:29] <robertmaxrees> document.querySelectorAll() != "javascript" necessarily.  it's apart of the API the browser exposes to you.
[09:06:36] <robertmaxrees> you've been writing javascript this entire time.,
[09:06:47] <robertmaxrees> it's the apis that are terrible.
[09:08:32] <aNewBy> oh
[09:08:59] <aNewBy> anyway, so you got me curious about selenium (been wanting to try that for some time now acutally), but is that using javascript or am I missing something ?
[09:09:13] <robertmaxrees> it's Java.
[09:09:39] <aNewBy> :O
[09:09:43] <aNewBy> so it's a no-go
[09:09:46] <robertmaxrees> why?
[09:09:52] <aNewBy> don't know it :D
[09:09:55] <robertmaxrees> then learn?
[09:09:56] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:09:59] <aNewBy> i know js, php
[09:10:22] <taplar> if you can do php, you can do java
[09:10:32] <robertmaxrees> basically.
[09:10:41] <taplar> especially if you get the whole OO concept
[09:10:47] <robertmaxrees> you already know 2 languages. getting spun up on a third shouldn't be too hard.
[09:10:52] <robertmaxrees> *classical OO concept.
[09:11:23] <robertmaxrees> i've heard good things about https://theintern.github.io/
[09:11:23] <aNewBy> darn all of you :D
[09:11:27] <aNewBy> making me work so hard :)))
[09:11:31] <taplar> not hard
[09:11:33] <aNewBy> i'm lazy
[09:11:33] <taplar> smarter
[09:11:40] <aNewBy> i know i know, jk :p
[09:12:11] <taplar> huh
[09:12:22] <aNewBy> darn... i'm checking out some vidz on selenium and it looks really sweet
[09:12:32] <robertmaxrees> it's what we use here.
[09:12:37] <aNewBy> (trying to  get a grip on how hard it would be )
[09:12:50] <taplar> we use twist, which is pretty much built on selenium
[09:12:59] <taplar> though i'm trying to get them to go to geb
[09:13:10] <robertmaxrees> take it to the bossman and be all like "hey there are a ton of other free functional testing tools out there any reason we're not using them?"
[09:13:33] <taplar> i spend X amount of time doing this crap
[09:13:39] <taplar> i could be spending Y
[09:13:43] <taplar> you pay me how much?
[09:13:44] <taplar> :)
[09:13:55] <robertmaxrees> taplar that's actually a terrible argument ;)
[09:13:59] <aNewBy> :))
[09:14:05] <aNewBy> but still you both make valid points
[09:14:10] <aNewBy> conclusion: stupid bosses
[09:14:14] <robertmaxrees> eh, not stupid;.
[09:14:20] <aNewBy> still... selenium is REALLY sweet darn!
[09:14:32] <aNewBy> byId. click() so easy :)
[09:14:45] <robertmaxrees> thre are versions of those in native js btw.
[09:15:03] <aNewBy> and after you do a project in selenium you can compile it into an exe? (maybe it's a stupid questions, still remember, noob here)
[09:15:07] <robertmaxrees> also - the boss probably doesn't know the alternatives/has their hands tied by the investment already made into the current setup.
[09:15:22] <robertmaxrees> aNewBy huh?
[09:15:40] <aNewBy> java projects aren't complied into .exe ?
[09:15:46] <aNewBy> here i go with the stupid questions :D
[09:15:46] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[09:15:53] <taplar> not a requirement
[09:15:59] <taplar> typically wars or ears
[09:16:16] <robertmaxrees> there's a #selenium if you have more questions :)
[09:16:24] <aNewBy> good point :)))
[09:16:46] <aNewBy> 157 users  how come so few?
[09:17:03] <robertmaxrees> because it's not as ubiquitous as some other projects.
[09:17:27] <robertmaxrees> since it's for functional testing.
[09:20:12] <nicechap> what is the difference between jquery's jQuery.ajax() and $(selector).load() method?
[09:20:22] <robertmaxrees> .load() is a shortcut.
[09:20:31] <robertmaxrees> it loads content into the specified selector.
[09:21:25] <nicechap> robertmaxrees, thanks, so otherwise you would have to do that in jQuery.ajax's callback function?
[09:24:02] <bongjovi> If I have var func = someFunction(); and then something like $(document).on('click', '[data-button]', func); Does this call the same instance of someFunction each time?
[09:24:22] <taplar> yes
[09:24:24] <bongjovi> i.e. how is it different from something like $(document).on('click', '[data-button]', function(){ someFunction() });
[09:24:34] <taplar> not different
[09:24:40] <aNewBy> same thing, coz of the scope
[09:24:49] <bongjovi> okay cool
[09:24:49] <bongjovi> thanks
[09:25:26] <taplar> actually, in your second one you have a little of extra code
[09:25:42] <taplar> it could just be $(document).on('click', '[data-button]', someFunction);
[09:25:51] <taplar> if your not giving it parameters
[09:26:00] <taplar> or if the only parameter is the event
[09:26:06] <aNewBy> :O
[09:26:10] <aNewBy> that would work too?
[09:26:12] <taplar> yep
[09:26:18] <aNewBy> nice, didn't know that
[09:26:31] <robertmaxrees> don't pass args to handlers fwiw.
[09:26:32] <aNewBy> i was always sending the (e) :))
[09:26:54] <robertmaxrees> nicechap sorry was away - yes.  you'd have to do it in the .done() callback.
[09:27:04] <robertmaxrees> aNewBy if you don't actually need to use the event object, no need to pass it
[09:27:58] <nicechap> thanks a lot robertmaxrees
[09:28:09] <bongjovi> new problem..
[09:28:20] <taplar> love the nick
[09:28:34] <nicechap> taplar, haha, I thought the same
[09:28:45] <bongjovi> I need to declare the func variable outside of the scope of that function as I need to call func.anotherFunction() somewhere else
[09:28:57] <bongjovi> so assuming var func = someFunction();
[09:29:00] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi declare it somewhere else then.
[09:29:28] <robertmaxrees> declare it in that shared scope.  otherwise you need to declare it as a property on the window object.
[09:29:31] <robertmaxrees> and that's... gross.
[09:29:43] <bongjovi> sure
[09:30:07] <bongjovi> how can I think do something like $(document).on('click', '[data-button]', func); where func is not the only event parameter?
[09:30:22] <robertmaxrees> what are you trying to pass?
[09:30:46] <robertmaxrees> because you can hack in .bind(), but i'd highly suggest avoiding passing args to that function if at all possible.
[09:30:48] <gnarf> anyone DC area - any good JS / jQuery meetups to go to this week or next?
[09:30:49] <bongjovi> something like $(document).on('click', '[data-button]', func function(){ somemorethings(); });
[09:31:56] <taplar> bongjovi: if you need more data, instead of passing them to the event, attach the info to your element as data or prop elements
[09:31:58] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi are you trying to define a function?
[09:32:10] <gnarf> bongjovi: .on('click', function(event) { func(event, otherParam); })?
[09:32:33] <robertmaxrees> you could use .bind(this, event, otherParams);, but that sounds hella gross.
[09:32:45] <bongjovi> should probably explain that this func is an instance of a plugin
[09:32:46] <gnarf> robertmaxrees: wouldn't want "event" there
[09:32:54] <robertmaxrees> oh that's right.
[09:32:54] <robertmaxrees> derp.
[09:32:56] <bongjovi> so i'm not trying to pass parameters
[09:33:07] <aNewBy> so ... here's something just for laughts got jquery working :d
[09:33:12] <bongjovi> i want to call the plugin and also run another function
[09:33:21] <gnarf> bongjovi: you want to bind more than one handler?
[09:33:23] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi then call the plugin and run a function.
[09:33:27] <aNewBy> eval(window.localStorage.getItem('jQuery')); window.console.log(window['$']); window['$']('body').html('holy shit it worked!')
[09:33:27] <bongjovi> yeah
[09:33:41] <gnarf> bongjovi: write two .on() calls - one for each handler? :)
[09:33:49] <gnarf> bongjovi: or write one function that calls both
[09:33:52] <robertmaxrees> ^
[09:34:09] <aNewBy> so thanks taplar for the code and robertmaxrees for the js support, that came in handy :)
[09:34:23] <taplar> so that worked?
[09:34:24] <aNewBy> and tomorrow i'll have a talk with my stupid boss
[09:34:32] <aNewBy> taplar: yep, just used eval :)
[09:34:34] <bongjovi> i guess ultimately i'm trying to figure out why I can do $(document).on('click', '[data-lightbox]', lightbox); but not $(document).on('click', '[data-lightbox]', function(){lightbox});
[09:34:38] <aNewBy> directly in my script
[09:34:52] <taplar> bongjovi: lightbox is the function definition
[09:34:59] <taplar> lightbox() is the evocation
[09:35:01] <taplar> invocation
[09:35:04] <gnarf> bongjovi: you'd want to lightbox.apply(this, arguments) -- to call the function passing "this" and the "arguments" of the handler
[09:35:06] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi you'd have to do function(){lightbox()}
[09:35:07] <taplar> i'm not a gamer, i swear
[09:35:29] <taplar> giving on 'lightbox' is giving it the function that -it- will execute
[09:35:37] <taplar> doing lightbox() is you executing it
[09:35:49] <gnarf> (or lightbox.call(this) )
[09:36:10] <gnarf> (assuming "lightbox" wants the "this" to be the element of the event
[09:37:30] <bongjovi> haha, thanks everyone, still confused but i'll keep reading
[09:37:44] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi why are you trying to call the plugin when you click something?
[09:38:00] <bongjovi> I'm using this: http://sorgalla.com/lity/
[09:38:17] <taplar> wasn't it also said to try to avoid selectors on attributes?
[09:38:31] <bongjovi> and using the programmatic approach because I need to use lightbox.close() somewhere else
[09:39:00] <robertmaxrees> yeah, i'd avoid using a data attribute for selecting, but this is a delegated listener to it's not as heinous as getting elements, but still kind of gross.
[09:39:35] <robertmaxrees> bongjovi yeah, you want to define a function that holds all of that logic, then call that function.
[09:42:20] <bongjovi> ahh okay, cool figured it out now
[09:42:26] <bongjovi> thanks
[09:47:09] <aNewBy> darn you taplar... now i gotta rewrite my Utils obj to use the new storage thingy :)))
[09:47:16] <aNewBy> and i worked 7 hours on it :((
[09:47:42] <aNewBy> but still pretty sweet idea with the local storage coz I can store all my scripts there, so congrats for the idea :)
[09:49:19] <taplar> mm?
[09:49:39] <taplar> if you set the $ globally you'd only have to reference the window thing once
[09:50:04] <aNewBy> i meant, now i gotta reorganize how i load the scripts :)
[09:50:11] <taplar> heh
[09:50:38] <taplar> the things we expect to find are not always at the end of the rabbit hole
[09:51:15] <aNewBy> actually this is very good, coz now i can make an autoloader for all the scripts
[09:51:33] <aNewBy> that's what i meant when i said i have to rewrite
[09:51:43] <aNewBy> anywayz, it's a good thing :p
[09:51:45] <taplar> 'refactor'
[09:51:59] <aNewBy> right, sry :)
[09:52:02] <taplar> don't say rewrite, especially to your boss, :P
[09:52:17] <aNewBy> don't forget, noob here :d
[09:52:27] <aNewBy> i always have this excuse :))
[09:54:54] <taplar> i spent about a day the other day thinking i came up with a new handy dandy way to build my namespaces, which actually worked great.  except it fubar'ed how my tests would work.
[09:54:58] <taplar> we live and learn
[09:55:22] <aNewBy> especially learn
[10:08:08] <taplar> also i kinda mentioned this earlier
[10:08:19] <taplar> http://jsfiddle.net/03rdes75/ this guy you had aNewBy?
[10:08:52] <taplar> could just use the existing function: http://jsfiddle.net/03rdes75/1/
[11:21:11] <unnu> stupid me is fighting with json again
[11:22:10] <robertmaxrees> json vorhees ooor... :)
[11:22:19] <unnu> if i have {select_value : select_text, select_value : select_text} returned via ajax to my page, and wanna add them to the select options, what do i do after jQuery.parseJson(data) ?
[11:22:46] <robertmaxrees> that's not a valid piece of JSON.
[11:22:54] <robertmaxrees> can't repeat a property name.
[11:23:09] <unnu> yeah, i abbreveated it and forgot quotes and such
[11:23:29] <robertmaxrees> mind making a quick fiddle?  no need to include the ajax call.
[11:23:36] <unnu> yeah sure
[11:23:52] <unnu> lemme dump the json just in case thats it
[11:36:16] <unnu> i cant even get it to work on the fiddle
[11:36:21] <unnu> i must be really messing something up
[11:36:21] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/p4tufp7o/3/
[11:36:53] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[11:37:22] <robertmaxrees> open your console.
[11:37:35] <robertmaxrees> that's not valid JSON.
[11:37:42] <robertmaxrees> is it an array or an object?
[11:37:51] <unnu> http://jsfiddle.net/p4tufp7o/5/
[11:37:54] <unnu> thanks
[11:37:56] <unnu> i am stupid
[11:38:03] * unnu sighs
[11:38:12] <robertmaxrees> looks like it works?
[11:38:19] <unnu> yeah thanks for that
[11:38:22] <unnu> :D
[11:38:28] * unnu gets back to work
[11:38:54] <aca20031> anyone here recommend a place to get a cert that all the major browsers will trust that doesnt cost over $100/year? I just want it for a home server to avoid the warnings, doesnt need to be too fancy
[11:39:53] <NoiseEee> if its just your home server, ignore the warnings
[11:40:22] <aca20031> I know thats an option, but i'd be willing to pay a reasonable price to get rid of them for me and people I link there :)
[11:40:48] <aca20031> if there isnt a reasonable price then ill do that
[11:43:19] <NoiseEee> i think $149 is the low end
[11:44:03] <aca20031> poopy. Where's the anti-trust law suit :(
[11:51:47] <snover> aca20031: namecheap.com
[11:52:43] <snover> aca20031: https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/domain-validation.aspx
[11:52:58] <Kartagis> 9999http://termbin.com/15v9 <--- is this legal?
[11:53:11] <Kartagis> http://termbin.com/15v9 <--- is this legal?
[11:53:11] <aca20031> $10/year? whats the catch
[11:53:15] <aca20031> besides lack of wildcard
[11:53:16] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis "legal"?
[11:53:41] <robertmaxrees> i mean, it's one way to do things.
[11:53:43] <robertmaxrees> kind of strange.
[11:53:45] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: valid, doable, correct
[11:53:50] <snover> aca20031: there is no catch
[11:54:04] <aca20031> cert chain in firefox/ie/chrome?
[11:54:26] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis i mean, i'm not sure why you'd re-bind like that instead of doing a delegated listener.
[11:54:58] <snover> aca20031: they are valid certs for all browsers from well-known CAs
[11:55:06] <aca20031> hm.
[11:55:30] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: can I do document.addEventListener("deviceready, resume"), function() { ... });?
[11:55:49] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis why are you re-binding at all instead of using a single delegated listener?
[11:56:18] <snover> who sells single-domain certs at $100/yr? rip-offs
[11:56:20] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: to be able to use both events?
[11:56:34] <robertmaxrees> Kartagis i mean the click event listener.
[11:56:54] <robertmaxrees> $(document).on('click', '#submit', function() {});
[11:57:02] <aca20031> snover it is a ripoff but its very common
[11:57:04] <robertmaxrees> and then go from there - ditch the two "addEventListener" calls.
[11:57:17] <Kartagis> robertmaxrees: no can do
[11:57:23] <robertmaxrees> huh?  why?
[11:57:28] <Kartagis> those are for phonegap
[11:57:45] <robertmaxrees> you should still have the document object available, right?
[11:58:08] <Kartagis> right now
[11:58:22] <Kartagis> right now, click isn't working
[11:58:35] <Kartagis> I'm wondering if that's the case
[11:58:45] <robertmaxrees> then document.addEventListener("deviceready", logIn, false); won't help, either.
[11:59:09] <Kartagis> yeah, it was
[11:59:34] <robertmaxrees> something isn't adding up here.  you should be able to do a delegated listener since that binds to the document - that should fix your issue.
[11:59:36] <Kartagis> I have to add those two addEventListener's
[12:03:21] <Kartagis> http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/cv6rpqg4/ <--- is this doable?
[12:04:03] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener - type only takes one.
[12:04:06] <robertmaxrees> it looks like.,
[12:40:07] <SmashingX2> I would like to just doenload the forbidden icon from jquery mobile in this page: http://demos.jquerymobile.com/1.4.2/icons/
[12:40:12] <SmashingX2> Any ideas how I can do ti?
[12:40:44] <robertmaxrees> inspect it.
[12:40:56] <robertmaxrees> then hit the ::after psuedoelement
[12:41:29] <robertmaxrees> it's a data uri
[12:41:55] <SmashingX2> hit the :after?
[12:41:58] <SmashingX2> where?
[12:42:03] <robertmaxrees> in the inspector.
[12:42:53] <robertmaxrees> right click on the button -> inspect element -> click the "::after" that's a child of the button element.
[12:43:57] <SmashingX2> Ok I clicked on that
[12:44:28] <SmashingX2> there’s a blackground image on csss but it has all this weird URL
[12:44:33] <robertmaxrees> exactly.
[12:44:37] <robertmaxrees> that's a data URI.
[12:44:43] <robertmaxrees> it's an inline SRV.
[12:44:45] <robertmaxrees> *SVG
[12:44:48] <robertmaxrees> that's the iamge.
[12:45:24] <SmashingX2> ok, so how can I see the URI then?
[12:45:31] <robertmaxrees> that's the URI.
[12:45:47] <robertmaxrees> the value for background-image is what you want.
[12:49:05] <SmashingX2> this one? images/icons-png/forbidden-white.png

[12:49:23] <robertmaxrees> that's the value.
[12:49:42] <robertmaxrees> sorry for the wall'o'text, but that's the value - that's what you'd use.
[12:50:11] <cannap> i cant see the image
[12:50:13] <cannap> ^^
[12:50:15] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:50:22] <robertmaxrees> and with that, lunch
[12:50:30] <SmashingX2> I know but if you copy and paste that into that address bar you don’t see the image
[12:51:47] <saml> a.each(function() { $(this) == bar;   would this comparison work?
[12:53:57] <SmashingX2> I should’ve gone into this page: http://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery-mobile
[13:00:26] <unnu> why add () tot he end of a function?
[13:00:51] <unnu> like var myFunc = function () { // do stuff }();
[13:17:57] <shoky> unnu: that calls the function right away, and puts the return value in myFunc
[13:23:14] <unnu> thanks shoky
[13:23:16] <unnu> :D
[13:31:34] <robertmaxrees> that was a good lunch.
[13:55:37] <unnu> robertmaxrees, whatchu eat?
[13:55:46] <unnu> sammich?
[13:55:49] <unnu> i love a good sammich
[13:56:02] <robertmaxrees> teriyaki
[13:56:21] <robertmaxrees> quick 'n cheap
[14:13:50] <tomatto> hi
[14:14:36] <robertmaxrees> good afternoon.
[14:15:17] <tomatto> please, how can i do you simultaneous ajax calls? when i call one, then another, it will abort first call
[14:15:25] <tomatto> two
[14:33:48] <unnu> tomatto . . . i had a little bit of an aneurysm reading your question
[14:34:36] <robertmaxrees> tomatto it shouldn't cancel anything.
[14:36:52] <unnu> the api has awesome stuff like .done() you might wanna look at
[14:38:53] <robertmaxrees> their base premise is broken - doing two requests should break anything.
[14:39:32] <unnu> WEBSOCKETS TIME!
[14:39:35] <unnu> j/k j/k
[14:42:42] <SmashingX2> I’m trying to understand jquery code written in a project. $(elem).closest('form').submit();
[14:43:06] <robertmaxrees> what're you confused by?
[14:43:07] <SmashingX2> When you submit a form with this, where’s usually the code of the form submition?
[14:43:18] <robertmaxrees> it'll be bound somewhere.
[14:43:39] <unnu> ^^^^
[14:43:47] <robertmaxrees> something is bound to the form submit - dunno where in your case.
[14:44:32] <SmashingX2> yeah but where usually goes?
[14:44:51] <SmashingX2> I mean how can I find it in the code?
[14:53:53] <jquery_master> hi
[14:54:00] <jquery_master> what exactly is jquery?
[14:54:43] <robertmaxrees> the irony is killing me.
[14:54:49] <robertmaxrees> jquery_master it's a DOM abstraction library
[14:55:05] <robertmaxrees> SmashingX2 it'll use either .on('submit or .submit(
[14:55:07] <robertmaxrees> one or the other.
[15:40:51] <Dr-007> good evening, i'd like to drag and drop rows in a table to another table. or drag and drop a table on another to make them merge
[15:41:30] <Dr-007> i was already using jquery sortable to order an unordered list, but i'm not sure the merging part can be done via this methode
[15:43:10] <robertmaxrees> you can do the latter, but it'll take a bit more effort than just making it work afaik.,
[15:44:32] <robertmaxrees> like, than just hooking it up.
[15:46:06] <Dr-007> do you know if you can go up 2 or more levels with the containment value?
[15:46:13] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:46:21] <Dr-007> and what do you mean by "you can do the latter"?
[15:46:34] <Dr-007> $('table').sortable({containment: "parent"});
[15:47:25] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you won't be able to use sortable for your merging setup.
[15:47:40] <Dr-007> hmm
[15:47:41] <Dr-007> ok
[15:47:52] <Dr-007> with draggable you can clone the html you select
[15:47:53] <Dr-007> right?
[15:47:58] <robertmaxrees> iirc yeah.
[15:48:13] <robertmaxrees> i'd maybe make a "merge" button instead.
[15:48:25] <Dr-007> hmm
[15:48:30] <Dr-007> good idea :)
[15:48:43] <Dr-007> its way easier
[15:48:44] <Dr-007> haha
[15:48:57] <Dr-007> i thought "ill make this one fancy"
[15:48:59] <robertmaxrees> i mean, they'd both be pretty easy to implement in practice, but the button would make more sense.
[15:49:35] <Dr-007> true, the page is pretty long aswell so dragging it way to the top will be unpleasant
[15:53:15] <bobdobbs`> what is the relationship between "deferred objects" and "javascript promises"?
[15:53:42] <bobdobbs`> oh wait, I think I can see it in the docs
[15:54:08] <bobdobbs`> a deferred returns a "promise object" when .promise() is used
[15:54:22] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Promise
[15:54:41] <bobdobbs`> thanks robertmaxrees
[15:55:20] <robertmaxrees> sure
[16:07:44] <bobdobbs`> robertmaxrees: darn, that page is a good read.
[16:07:48] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[16:08:00] <bobdobbs`> it's kinda helping me get my head around prototypes
[16:08:09] <robertmaxrees> prototypes are pretty simple tbh.
[16:08:47] <bobdobbs`> I guess so. but I've never really grokked js prototypy for practical purposes
[16:08:57] <robertmaxrees> there's not really much of a reason to :)
[16:09:14] <bobdobbs`> hehe. this is a mild relief to me.
[16:09:44] <bobdobbs`> like, I get that I _can_ extend object prototypes. I'm just not sure why I should.
[16:09:48] <robertmaxrees> think of it more in terms of "behavior delegation" - you ask if an object has a method.  it says "no".  the engine looks at it's prototype, which is just another object.  the engine looks at it, and it DOES have that method.
[16:10:06] <robertmaxrees> and you should never extend prototypes, save for some very specific examples.
[16:10:11] <bobdobbs`> that's actually a great way of explaining it
[16:10:24] <bobdobbs`> ok
[16:11:33] <robertmaxrees> especially of objects you don't own.  if you find yourself modifying/adding/etc on, say, Array.prototype or String.prototype, you're going down a painful road.
[16:12:09] <bobdobbs`> k
[16:12:18] <bobdobbs`> yeah
[16:14:28] <mdev> $('.div.personal-st ul li').css('padding', '6px 0 3px 7px');
[16:14:36] <mdev> not working, trying to override a class property
[16:14:38] <mdev> any ideas?
[16:15:03] <robertmaxrees> should work just file.
[16:15:12] <robertmaxrees> *fine - you sure that selector is getting what you expect?
[16:16:32] <mdev> not sure, guess i'll just manually edit the css
[16:16:41] <mdev> aint got lot of time to fiddle with this
[16:16:44] <robertmaxrees>  $('.div.personal-st ul li') - easy one.
[16:16:47] <robertmaxrees> $('div.personal-st ul li')
[16:16:58] <robertmaxrees> though i've leave the tagname off entirely.
[16:17:14] <robertmaxrees> $('.personal-st ul li') - either way, you had an extra period in front.,
[16:18:49] <sdegutis> HELP!
[16:19:14] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis what's up?
[16:19:44] <sdegutis> I have a collection and I want to get an object where the keys are the items' data-foo and the values of those are the item.prop('checked') of each item.
[16:19:52] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[16:19:54] <sdegutis> I've no idea what the most spectacular way of accomplishing this is.
[16:20:16] <sdegutis> I know the extremely boring way, but that's excessively boring so I refuse on principle to write it.
[16:21:45] <robertmaxrees> sdegutis why an object and not an array?
[16:21:59] <sdegutis> robertmaxrees: I need to use it for sending to a JSON thingy.
[16:22:23] <robertmaxrees> then you're SOL - you're doing an .each() and setting things on an object.
[16:22:34] <sdegutis> :'(
[16:22:44] <sdegutis> Oh jQuery, you really do hate me don't you?
[16:22:47] <sdegutis> I knew it all along.
[16:22:49] <robertmaxrees> not at all.
[16:22:52] <shoky> add  // WOAH
[17:09:14] <esaym153> Is there a good way to add a class to every odd div on a page (that is under a top level div of course). I basically have a page that I add divs to via json and button listeners. And every odd div I append, I want it to have a different background color
[17:09:46] <esaym153> seems like a common task, hence the question
[17:12:13] <robertmaxrees> use css instead.

[17:13:28] <esaym153> robertmaxrees: super sweet, thought you could do it with CSS :)
[18:27:40] <acidjazz> :)
[19:22:03] <arcanine69> okay so if i put a name tag on a contentEdtiable div .. is it still valid ?
[19:24:25] <arcanine69> for when i use form.serialize()
[19:24:29] <arcanine69> will it pull in the contentEditable details
[20:07:48] <acidjazz> what is contentEditable
[20:07:53] <acidjazz> are you using some sort of plugin
[23:05:00] <renka> good morning. :)
