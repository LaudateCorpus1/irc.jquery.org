[00:46:59] <Z3R0> Anyone know how to get the buttons extension with datatables to work ?
[00:47:39] <Z3R0> I’ve included the js files, added buttons: [ ] to DataTable({ }) options, and modified the output dom: to include ‘B’ but still nothing
[00:53:09] <iateadonut> i can get the value of a dropdown passed into a function through $(this).val(), and i can get the text of that dropdown through $('option:selected').text(), but how do i put the two together so i can get the text of the dropdown value after passing it through a function?
[00:53:43] <Z3R0> why would you need both ?
[00:54:18] <iateadonut> i need the text of the selected item sent through a function through $(this)
[00:54:33] <Z3R0> can you toss up a fiddle?
[00:54:39] <aFeijo> hi folks... I need to show a dropdown field if the user select a file in another field. What would be the selector in that case?
[00:55:28] <Z3R0> .change and .toggle ?
[00:55:43] <aFeijo> Z3R0, was that for me? I'll test, thanks
[00:55:47] <Z3R0> ^ yea
[01:00:49] <iateadonut> yes, i'm having trouble adding jquery to jsfiddle though
[01:01:13] <Uhkis> iateadonut: press the javascript button in the middleish
[01:01:16] <aFeijo> Z3R0, it worked with .change(), thanks
[01:01:40] <Z3R0> awesome ;)
[01:02:15] <iateadonut> https://jsfiddle.net/bu339ceL/
[01:02:35] <iateadonut> instead of console.log'ing the val(), i'd like to console.log the text() of the selected item
[01:06:46] <Z3R0> console.log($(this).find('option:selected').text());
[01:08:31] <iateadonut> thanks!
[02:46:25] <Cypris> jqueryui sortable. I have a set of container ul's which draggable li's can go into. at load time, all li's are sorted alphabetically . While in a drag, the placeholder gets style, text, and a data tag to make it look like the li you are dragging (a ghost of it). What I want is for the placeholder to be sorted alphabetically in the parent being hovered over. any thoughts?

[05:37:52] <printForever> Internet Explorer 11 - problems with executing jQuery, too slow, what to do?
[05:38:04] <printForever> in local enviroment it runs really fast
[05:38:22] <printForever> when loaded from server, its sooo slow...
[05:41:26] <Wysi> printForever jquery cnd was with problems a few days ago. i just change the scripts to the google cdn and solve the problem
[05:41:44] <printForever> Wysi, not an issue
[05:46:42] <lilalinu_> From within an iframe: How do I get the position of the iframe relative to the parent window?
[05:50:00] <Wysi> prinForever can you send me a link with the problem
[05:57:43] <lilalinu_> got it
[07:18:30] <nindustries> Hi guys, so I use $("#topology").stop().animate() to move a div when I scroll. Problem is when I reach the bottom, the content div increases and I can scroll forever. Ideas?  https://datapeak.hazcod.com/solution/features
[07:26:14] <nindustries> nvm, fixed it: http://pastie.org/10789881
[07:34:41] <printForever> TypeError: e.params is undefined
[07:35:03] <printForever> http://pastebin.com/u3kmvfDc
[07:35:12] <printForever> e is defined
[07:35:18] <printForever> why is it throwing an error?
[07:36:36] <printForever> anyone?
[07:39:59] <shoky> what is e.params?
[07:40:21] <printForever> hi shoky, its params for the class
[07:40:38] <shoky> huh what class. event objects don't have a params property..
[07:40:53] <printForever> ??
[07:41:03] <shoky> ?
[07:41:06] <printForever> I don't understand what you mean
[07:41:24] <shoky> there is no "params" property in event objects. that's why e.params is undefined...
[07:41:40] <printForever> o.O but there has to be...
[07:41:48] <printForever> I checked it
[07:42:03] <shoky> if it's undefined, then there is not :)
[07:42:17] <printForever> maybe its outside the scope... gotta check that
[07:42:39] <shoky> you can just do  e.stopPropagation() ....
[07:42:48] <printForever> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35206029/trying-to-stop-event-propagation-of-select2-multi-select-option-remove
[07:43:26] <shoky> you didn't think to mention it's a select2 event?
[07:43:37] <shoky> though it's not.. it's a change event
[07:43:41] <printForever> ... for the last month, I've only been asking about it
[07:43:49] <shoky> huh? who cares?
[07:43:53] <printForever> e.stopPropagation() doesent work
[07:44:01] <shoky> you think everyone here remembers what everybody else has been asking...
[07:44:02] <shoky> ?
[07:44:08] <printForever> my bad
[07:44:39] <shoky> anyways event objects don't have params property.  maybe in select2 events it adds some params, but in that example in SO it's a "select2:unselect" event, not a regular "change" event
[07:45:17] <printForever> if I remove it from "change" it doesen't work
[07:45:19] <printForever> o.O
[07:46:33] <shoky> shrugs
[07:46:37] <printForever> me too
[07:46:48] <printForever> I got no help from select2 gus
[07:46:52] <printForever> *guys
[07:46:57] <printForever> the Documentation sucks
[07:47:03] <printForever> and you can't find anything
[07:47:05] <shoky> indeed
[07:48:25] <shoky> anyway i think you only get that "params" property in select2 events
[07:48:42] <printForever> so, if its defined
[07:48:45] <printForever> and it works
[07:48:49] <printForever> why is there an error? :(
[07:49:02] <shoky> if there's an error that it's undefined, then it's undefined
[07:49:15] <printForever> can I... define it myself
[07:49:21] <shoky> ...
[07:49:23] <shoky> yes
[07:49:28] <shoky> why would you do that :\
[07:49:34] <printForever> so there wouldn't be an error
[07:49:38] <shoky> :\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
[07:49:40] <printForever> can I define it as nil?
[07:49:42] <shoky> i don't even......
[07:49:49] <shoky> nil?
[07:49:52] <printForever> null
[07:50:04] <shoky> you can define it as whatever you want... i don't see the point tho :|
[07:50:39] <printForever> ... how do I prevent it from throwing an error...
[07:50:50] <printForever> the more I explore select2 the more I'm confused
[07:50:51] <shoky> remove the code that throws the error
[07:50:58] <printForever> but then the feature does not work
[07:51:09] <shoky> no idea what you're doing man, can't answer for real
[07:51:31] <printForever> you were right
[07:51:36] <printForever> there isn't param for change
[10:40:26] <hirsty> hey all....any way of prining <object>s?
[10:46:17] <shoky> doing what?
[10:58:12] <hirsty> printning the contents of an <object>
[10:58:18] <hirsty> (A pdf)
[11:25:19] <Devrim> If a variable is getting output as Object object what am I doing wrong? What do I need to look at?
[11:26:58] <NaNIssues> Devrim: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4079274/how-to-get-an-objects-properties-in-javascript-jquery
[11:27:13] <Devrim> thanks NaNIssues
[11:27:24] <NaNIssues> Np
[11:27:45] <NaNIssues> https://jsfiddle.net/pr5tr6bh/ Is there a reason $finalSale will return a NaN?
[11:28:33] <NaNIssues> the variables given, are global variables that when I console.log(isNaN(var)); I return false
[11:28:52] <NaNIssues> but when I try to call $totalSavings alone, I receive NaN
[11:40:08] <decx> mmmh.. naan
[11:41:01] <NaNIssues> decx: https://jsfiddle.net/pr5tr6bh/1/
[11:41:06] <NaNIssues> I updated it for more context
[11:41:59] <NaNIssues> Now I have .cell-prices > .discount commented out which gives me NaN, but when I uncomment it, the whole thing works.
[11:42:11] <NaNIssues> I don't get what I'm doing wrong that makes the NaN?
[11:43:23] <skinux> What is the easiest code to verify that an <input type="file"> element has a file selected for upload?
[11:44:19] <NaNIssues> skinux: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16125255/how-i-know-if-my-input-file-has-content-selected ?
[11:44:24] <taplar> NaNIssues: extraSale is NaN
[11:44:53] <Z3R0> yes it is ;)
[11:44:59] <Z3R0> $('#main').append('<div class="test">' + $extraSavings + '</div>');
[11:45:01] <Z3R0> was just testing that
[11:45:10] <NaNIssues> taplar: isn't that what parseFloat() is for?
[11:45:30] <taplar> printing $group.find('.cell-prices > .discount').text() is returning blank
[11:45:42] <NaNIssues> well I have it commented it out atm
[11:45:50] <NaNIssues> if you uncomment it, the whole thing works.
[11:45:55] <taplar> right, lol
[11:46:01] <taplar> soooooo.....
[11:46:20] <NaNIssues> I'm trying to get it to work w.o the extraSale T_T
[11:47:04] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/pr5tr6bh/3/ ?
[11:47:51] <Z3R0> odd
[11:48:01] <NaNIssues> really
[11:48:02] <Z3R0> my final sale, using his code and uncommenting the div's was $70
[11:48:14] <NaNIssues> taplar was it really just  || 0 ?
[11:48:16] <NaNIssues> TT
[11:48:29] <NaNIssues> I should of just tried that yesterday...
[11:48:34] <taplar> not saying it's accurate.  haven't looked hard at the math your doing
[11:49:43] <taplar> but, no NaN, :)
[11:49:52] <NaNIssues> It's k, the math is good as far as I can tell. already had it confirmed good by others
[11:50:01] <NaNIssues> Just ran into that issue D:
[11:50:40] <NaNIssues> Man, if it really was or 0 lol, I'm so dumb, I should of just tried it yesterday... lol
[11:51:03] <NaNIssues> taplar: thanks a lot!!!
[12:08:43] <anternat> hello everybody
[12:08:52] <decx> hi doctor nick
[12:10:17] <anternat> i  have this html code to post with ajax : <input type="hidden" name="formkey" value="<?php echo randStrGen (30);?>"/> Since the key is dnamic how would data: {"country_id=" + country_id, formkey = <?????????>}, part should be?
[12:11:30] <anternat> bbs
[12:13:36] <taplar> 'the key is dynamic' ?
[12:15:51] <persina> Is effect not supported? getting error: Uncaught TypeError: $(...).effect is not a function
[12:16:40] <taplar> jquery ui method
[12:16:52] <decx> regardless, we're not living in the 00s anymore use css3
[12:22:30] <Enerel> anyone famililar with Swiper plugin?
[12:23:13] <bango2> anternat when working with variables to put into json, it should be an array that becomes json serialized
[12:27:41] <bango2> so its essentially the same way youre adding country_id, but now you use jquery to get the input box value.
[12:27:42] <bango2> http://pastebin.com/ucadx8tV
[12:29:13] <Enerel> anyone familiar with Swiper? http://jsbin.com/jaxeyiyiji/edit?html,js
[12:29:56] <Enerel> swiper slideTo is not working
[12:32:31] <taplar> bango2: you got a space between input and the name filter
[12:38:04] <CSWookie> Hey, all.  Is there a way in the function passed to map to get the last element of the map?  Like, if I were mapping over (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), and I was currently on 3, is there a way for the function to find out that it was last on 2?
[12:38:17] <CSWookie> Apart from closure shenanigans, I mean?
[12:38:37] <taplar> one of the parameters of map is the current index
[12:39:56] <CSWookie> taplar: derf derf... I'm used to map in languages that don't pass that, and forgot what I'd read in the docs.  Thanks.
[12:40:41] <decx> there's even a reference to the array itself so you can contain all you need inside the map callback
[12:40:55] <decx> (element, index, array)
[12:41:58] <daslicht> https://github.com/select2/select2/issues/4296
[12:43:43] <taplar> what version are you using?
[12:44:04] <CSWookie> decx: The docs I'm looking at don't mention that... are there better docs for me to look at?
[12:44:21] <taplar> i'm going to assume 3.X then
[12:44:29] <taplar> oh, bah, different person, heh
[12:44:38] <CSWookie> I'll probably use the latest version I can get my hands on, I'm using jquery in a browser plugin.
[12:44:58] <taplar> that was directed to daslicht
[12:45:30] <CSWookie> I thin kthe current version I have downloaded is 2.2, but I'm not fussed, so long as I can get up-to-date docs.
[12:45:42] <daslicht> taplar: let me see
[12:45:54] <taplar> daslicht: ok it looks like 3.X has it too.  there's an option to give a 'matcher' option for your own custom matching
[12:46:02] <daslicht> 3.5.1
[12:46:20] <daslicht> any idea how to implement this ?
[12:46:21] <taplar> http://select2.github.io/select2/ <-- search for "Custom Matcher"
[12:46:50] <daslicht> shouldnt be that hard
[12:47:05] <daslicht> i fiddle around heh
[12:48:51] <taplar> CSWookie: are you mapping on a basic array or a jquery object?
[12:49:51] <anternat> taplar >> yes the key is dynamic
[12:50:37] <taplar> what are you calling a 'key'?
[12:51:41] <daslicht> @taplar: semas to be fixed in 4.0  https://select2.github.io/examples.html#matcher
[12:52:02] <anternat> bango2 thank you ,checking your code now
[12:52:12] <robertmaxrees> holy woah i'm exhausted today
[12:52:21] <anternat> taplar>> that is a 30 char random string
[12:52:21] <taplar> daslicht: i don't believe that's a fix.  they are saying that's a way to do it
[12:52:28] <daslicht> yeah just read
[12:52:32] <decx> CSWookie: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map
[12:52:36] <daslicht> its demo of the matcher i was looking for lol
[12:52:48] <taplar> anternat: so it has a random value, it's not a random form name
[12:53:42] <taplar> that's not a 'key', it's just a value
[12:54:10] <taplar> maybe relate to a business entity called a 'key', but that's beside the point
[12:55:26] <anternat> yes taplar,random for each request
[12:55:39] <anternat> i was trying to do sort of form protection,
[12:55:48] <anternat> will paste the code ,1 sec. plz
[12:56:10] <decx> a nonce then
[12:57:24] <anternat> after bango2's notice modified it like this: http://pastebin.com/n2JwKdH8
[12:57:28] <taplar> probably a csrf token
[12:57:35] <anternat> will locally test it now
[12:58:01] <taplar> take out the space after the input
[12:58:05] <decx> if they are inputs just serialize their form
[12:58:07] <taplar> there is no nesting
[12:58:15] <taplar> ^^
[12:58:16] <taplar> ^^^
[12:58:36] <anternat> testing on my own environment i meant :)
[12:59:28] <decx> doesnt make sense to piecemeal your own dataparameters if you already have a form that does it for you
[12:59:35] <decx> that's like the whole point of a form
[12:59:38] <anternat> :/ after modification second dynamic drop down menu call cancelled
[13:00:12] <taplar> lol
[13:00:13] <taplar> hold on
[13:00:19] <taplar> that's a messed up object constructor
[13:00:35] <taplar> your got a string concat going on it the first one, an assignment for the second part, -_-
[13:00:39] <decx> yeah what's up there
[13:00:52] <decx> 2 statements
[13:01:14] <decx> must be some es9 object
[13:01:20] <taplar> lmao
[13:01:33] <anternat> okay
[13:02:01] <taplar> so back to decx's point.  why are you not just serializing the form?
[13:02:58] <anternat> this is a modified version of a pre-made dynamic drop down menu,wasnt able to code it myself,so i am only able to ask and modify by now
[13:03:30] <taplar> so.... there is no form?
[13:03:39] <anternat> there is
[13:03:52] <anternat> 3 level form: country+state+city
[13:04:07] <taplar> the elements exist in a <form>
[13:04:17] <anternat> yes
[13:04:24] <taplar> so why can you not serialize the form?
[13:04:36] <anternat> i dont know :)
[13:04:47] <bango2> you can :)
[13:04:47] <taplar> so maybe try that instead of reinventing the wheel?
[13:04:52] <CSWookie> decx: Oh, you meant js's map.  I was looking at jquery's.
[13:05:59] <anternat> all i needed to add a secondary value to post,so that i can check if the value if coming from the form by php
[13:06:01] <decx> CSWookie: ah that might not have it
[13:06:17] <daslicht> Taplar: Where is the documentation about the matcher in version 4 ? I only see the compat thing,  please?
[13:06:19] <daslicht> idea?
[13:06:32] <taplar> that last thing you posted was it, i believe
[13:06:51] <daslicht> thats teh compatibility thing to use old matchers
[13:07:09] <taplar> right, but it shows you it's usage
[13:07:19] <daslicht> ahh -> https://select2.github.io/announcements-4.0.html#new-matcher
[13:07:21] <daslicht> thats it
[13:07:29] <daslicht> I dont want compat
[13:07:29] <taplar> it shows you the inputs the method takes.  then it's up to you how to compare them to return true/false
[13:07:33] <daslicht> I just upgrade to 4
[13:08:27] <daslicht> yikes , it still use teh compat lol
[13:09:49] <daslicht> hm this doc is still about migration
[13:17:28] <taplar> daslicht: https://jsfiddle.net/3xopx0fg/
[13:18:23] <decx> well done
[13:18:28] <daslicht> thanks , that will do it until i move to 4
[13:18:31] <daslicht> Yeah !
[13:18:32] <daslicht> :D
[13:18:46] <taplar> taplar, did you say that's a way to give a custom matcher?
[13:18:47] <daslicht> if at all
[13:18:48] <daslicht> hehe
[13:18:50] <taplar> why yes, yes you did taplar
[13:18:59] <taplar> :P
[13:19:20] <daslicht> lovely
[13:19:23] <daslicht> *hug*
[13:19:25] <daslicht> :D
[13:19:41] <anternative> taplar,daslicht,bango2>>  thank you very much indeed
[13:19:47] <anternative> i am done now
