[00:00:00] <HQRaja> OK this is the final result for now
[00:00:01] <HQRaja> http://jsfiddle.net/c3gEt/5/
[00:00:46] <HQRaja> Errr...wait
[00:00:48] <HQRaja> wrong one
[00:00:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: I can do it with rows its just that my sortables doesnt work then
[00:02:18] <jphase> Rohan_Bhangui: perhaps use dblclick event instead?
[00:02:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> wait what?
[00:02:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> what does that have to do with collapsable lists?
[00:03:21] <jphase> for your collapsable event, a double click might not conflict with your mousedown/up events if that's your issue
[00:03:27] <HQRaja> Sorry this: http://jsfiddle.net/c3gEt/8/
[00:05:39] <tabeaux> HQRaja: Neat!
[00:06:53] <HQRaja> tabeaux: Thanks =)
[00:07:12] <HQRaja> One last thing left to figure in the presentation: perfectly aligning the Xs and Os in my divs vertically
[00:07:41] <HQRaja> Currently using a font-size in em that seems to do fine in this grid size, but gets out of alignment if I change grid size
[00:09:48] <jphase> HQRaja: you could make the boxes relative and make the nought/cross classes absolute :D
[00:09:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: my issue is how to do the collapseable tables thats my issue
[00:10:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> i dont know how im gonna attack the problem programmatically as well as visually
[00:10:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways ill talk to you tom
[00:10:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> also quick question: what is the state of botscrape
[00:10:37] <jphase> I'm working on the recursion right now but running into some issues
[00:11:03] <jphase> this stuff is a bit tricky
[00:11:35] <HQRaja> jphase: I kinda suck at positioning :( Perhaps because of being new to this...all them float:s, clear:s, align:s and display:s combinations make me nuts heh
[00:11:41] <jphase> I'm also not the most experienced node.js nerd yet, but luckily I've figured out all the async stuff so it should be mostly DOM parsing and string manipulation from here on out
[00:13:06] <jphase> HQRaja: if you make the container (the boxes in this case) position: relative; and make the centered elements (the nought and cross) position: absolute; top: 50%;  and then do margin-top: -1/2 the height;  then it should be vertically centered
[00:13:20] <jphase> you can do the same thing with left: 50%; margin-left: -1/2 the width;
[00:14:26] <HQRaja> jphase: Oh OK. Though I'm using float:left for those divs...would this work with that?
[00:14:46] <HQRaja> I tried display:table-cell but that conflicts with float:left, it appears
[00:15:14] <jphase> HQRaja: yeah, if the float: left; is on the boxes containing the x's and o's then that should work fine
[00:15:43] <jphase> position: relative; is how they are currently rendered but you need to define it to make the child absolute elements stay within the box
[00:15:54] <HQRaja> Oh OK
[00:15:59] <HQRaja> Lemme do that right away
[00:17:53] <HQRaja> jphase: I've got it all except for the margin-top bit
[00:18:21] <jphase> so if your x's and o's are like... 50px in height, you'd do margin-top: -25px;
[00:18:29] <HQRaja> Oh OK
[00:18:31] <jphase> works with any unit though, %, em, rem, etc.
[00:18:40] <HQRaja> And how do I know the height of my X's and O's?
[00:18:47] <HQRaja> Oh got it
[00:19:10] <jphase> just gotta define it to your liking
[00:19:13] <jphase> yeah
[00:20:06] <HQRaja> Can I set font size to 50% of the height of the div?
[00:20:19] <HQRaja> i.e. can it take a percent value?
[00:21:05] <jphase> yeah, you can use % on font-size
[00:23:05] <HQRaja> jphase: The height bit isn't working
[00:23:22] <HQRaja> I changed it from the em value to 50% and its tiny
[00:23:40] <HQRaja> doesn't seem to be close to 50% of the div's height
[00:23:44] <jphase> you'd probably want the height to be 100% (100% of the container)
[00:23:48] <jphase> hmm
[00:23:51] <jphase> fiddle me
[00:24:00] <jphase> that sounded awesome.... uh... link me to your fiddle
[00:24:05] <HQRaja> Haha
[00:24:07] <HQRaja> Okie :)
[00:24:14] <HQRaja> One sec
[00:25:13] <HQRaja> jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/c3gEt/9/
[00:25:33] <HQRaja> margin-top: 25%; messes it
[00:25:48] <HQRaja> Oh wait...-25%
[00:26:14] <HQRaja> Nah that messes it up in the other direction
[00:27:14] <jphase> oic, this is a bit different
[00:27:28] <HQRaja> I suppose
[00:28:12] <HQRaja> Why doesn't CSS3 just simply let us vertically align anything inside a div like horizontal alignment? That's retarded
[00:28:43] <HQRaja> When it can do text-align: center, what's so hard about supporting vertical-align: middle?
[00:29:05] <HQRaja> In fact why isn't there a text-vertical-align or similar property, if vertical alignment is tough for stuff other than text?
[00:29:07] <HQRaja> Beats me!
[00:30:21] <jphase> hehe, common annoyance
[00:30:28] <HQRaja> BTW when you said height of the text should be 100%, you meant font-size?
[00:30:36] <HQRaja> I'm a bit confused on that
[00:31:07] <HQRaja> Since the text isn't in any tag of its own...its just in that div...so if I use height, it'll change the height of the div instead, no?
[00:31:13] <jphase> well with this particular set of markup it's a bit different, I was generalizing
[00:31:22] <HQRaja> I see
[00:31:27] <jphase> is it not vertically centered when you take off the margin-top?
[00:31:45] <HQRaja> It isn't
[00:32:02] <HQRaja> just horizontally, due to the text-align: center; bit
[00:33:52] <HQRaja> Well, I guess I'll leave it at this now, and get some sleep. Been at it for over 14 hours now.
[00:34:06] <HQRaja> Thanks a ton for all the help jphase :)
[00:34:39] <jphase> np
[00:48:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: cool, let me know how botscrape goes
[00:48:53] <jphase> will do
[00:50:28] <jphase> you needing to use it for that thing you mentioned?
[00:52:25] <adammcarth> Guys
[00:52:42] <adammcarth> You know how you can log to the browser's console in jQuery?
[00:53:04] <adammcarth> Is it possible to log like that from a web framework such as rails or Sinatra, or does it have to be written to a file?
[00:54:58] <jphase> adammcarth: it'd have to be built into the framework or you'd have to write something that renders your site and logs the console I'd imagine
[00:55:41] <adammcarth> but traditionally speaking
[00:55:54] <adammcarth> a browsers console outputs javascript messages only?
[01:03:06] <systemfault> All browsers have their javascript console
[01:13:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyone know how I can use jquery ui sortables
[01:13:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> to sort columns
[01:13:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> of a table
[01:14:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> that has a tr td strucutre
[01:14:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: you around
[01:15:49] <shoky> Rohan_Bhangui i doubt that's possible
[01:17:51] <shoky> Rohan_Bhangui though i there's a dragtable plugin using sortable that does it
[01:18:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya
[01:18:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> so I wanna know how to do it
[01:18:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: is there any way to change the targets
[01:18:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> so that sortables is not reliant on the structure
[01:18:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> or is that a restriction
[01:19:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: ^
[01:22:41] <shoky> you can use it like the docs/examples show..
[01:23:09] <shoky> it's reliant on the structure yes
[01:24:41] <shoky> but the structure of the <th> row is fine for it
[01:25:15] <shoky> you just gotta make sure the other cells in the column get moved too ;p
[01:34:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> th/
[01:34:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> sry not familar with that tag
[01:56:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> shoky: shouldnt i be able to do drag and drop columns manually
[01:57:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> not using jquery ui
[01:57:12] <Whiskey> can jQuery bind ctrl-a in here "$(document).bind("cucontextmenu", function (e) {"
[01:57:14] <Whiskey> ?
[02:19:31] <bigbugjava> Hi I have input file field that is multipie, I want them all to go to server, actually the question, is how to get them all in a Array?
[02:36:01] <k0bi> hi i got this page that works ok at http://jsfiddle.net/kobipar/uktg2/ but when i put the page in my server its not worknig the same page can someone know what i am missing in my iis
[02:41:38] <bigbugjava> I'm trying to get an array of [input] file, that is multipie, into an array, that will contain all paths
[02:44:28] <k0bi> can someone know which seting to do on my iis so my page will work?
[02:44:43] <k0bi> as it worknig from http://jsfiddle.net/kobipar/uktg2/
[02:47:52] <shoky> k0bi http://enable-cors.org/server.html
[02:48:24] <k0bi> <shoky>  thx i am reading it now
[02:48:31] <shoky> k0bi: jQuery.support.cors = true;   and    crossDomain: true    don't do anything, or don't do what you ant
[02:48:32] <shoky> want
[02:48:40] <shoky> don't use those
[02:49:35] <k0bi> ok i will try witout those lines
[02:50:09] <shoky> k0bi: but uhh, your iis is the one the ajax is requesting from?
[02:50:36] <shoky> k0bi: i mean, the url for the ajax request - that is the one on your iis?
[02:50:54] <k0bi> the page i had puted here do the job but my server with the same page not worknig
[02:51:11] <k0bi> yes the same url
[02:51:17] <k0bi> ..w1.aspx
[02:51:25] <k0bi> its wird
[02:51:27] <shoky> vcccounter.com is your server?
[02:51:30] <k0bi> yes
[02:51:43] <shoky> ok good, just making sure
[02:51:49] <k0bi> i do trace
[02:51:55] <shoky> then you just need to enable cors on IIS
[02:52:02] <shoky> and your script should work
[02:52:06] <k0bi> ofter openning the page from 2 places the same page
[02:52:20] <k0bi> ok cool i will try it
[02:52:30] <k0bi> sec
[02:53:23] <shoky> k0bi i see the headers are there, you enabled it
[02:53:45] <k0bi> yhaa
[02:54:05] <k0bi> sorry it work all good but my problem is with the ie8
[02:54:11] <k0bi> that my problem
[02:54:14] <shoky> it doesn't work?
[02:54:19] <shoky> with the XDR thing?
[02:54:20] <k0bi> on ie8
[02:54:25] <k0bi> yes
[02:54:29] <shoky> i don't know the xdr you have in your fiddle,
[02:54:41] <shoky> use this: https://github.com/jaubourg/ajaxHooks/blob/master/src/xdr.js
[02:55:04] <k0bi> i need to add this for it to work?
[02:55:33] <shoky> also maybe there are restrictions on xdr on the beforeunload event, no idea about that
[02:56:05] <shoky> you need an xdr transport for CORS to work in IE8, yeah. you already used one in your fiddle, i just dont know that one so i linked to one i know
[02:56:56] <k0bi> so just to add the link it will solve i will try it now
[02:57:17] <shoky> oh
[02:57:36] <shoky> k0bi: $.ajax docs say:  Cross-domain requests and dataType: "jsonp" requests do not support synchronous operation.
[02:57:49] <shoky> you can't do a non-async cross-domain request
[02:58:36] <k0bi> but all works in all browser just my othere iis not do the job
[02:58:51] <shoky> oks dono
[03:00:50] <k0bi> <shoky> i just add the lins and still my problem remaind
[03:05:56] <k0bi> <shoky> see this http://www.wine4all.co.il/1.html
[03:06:53] <k0bi> the same page and still from http://jsfiddle.net/kobipar/uktg2/ its work and from here not
[03:13:58] <Rashad> Hello.
[03:14:05] <Rashad> I have the following problem: .load() is freezing my page.
[03:14:28] <Rashad> It didn't freeze my page when I tested locally, but on the server it is now freezing it.
[03:17:05] <Rashad> This is the website: http://dardeshni.com/ (it's in Arabic). Try clicking on the rectangular black button with an asterisk (*) inside it, and the function connect() { 	criteria = {location: '', max_age: $("#age_range").val()[1], min_age: $("#age_range").val()[0], gender: $("input:radio[name ='sex']:checked").val()};		$('button').html('تمهّل...');		$('body').load('chat.html');	}
[03:17:27] <Rashad> Will fire and it will make the page freeze until .load() has finished loading.
[03:18:52] <Rashad> Even this line: $('button').html('تمهّل...'); doesn't always execute because of the freezing. In fact, it rarely ever executes (it is supposed to change the same black button's text and it doesn't most of the time at least for me.)
[03:19:46] <Rashad> Even though this line comes before the .load() line.
[03:20:51] <Rashad> Ah! I think I figured it out!
[03:21:17] <Rashad> It's because chat.html is cached, but some of the <script>s there isn't.
[03:21:37] <Rashad> So this is the browser's problem.
[03:25:32] <Rashad> Seems like that isn't the problem.
[03:28:46] <Rashad> No it is the problem.

[03:49:35] <mikunos> hi guys, how have I to fade in an ajax result in a div?
[03:58:50] <mikunos> this is my jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/fb9rM/1/
[03:58:55] <mikunos> any help?
[04:03:58] <shoky> mikunos http://jsfiddle.net/fb9rM/2/
[04:04:19] <mikunos> hi shoky
[04:04:38] <shoky> hy
[04:04:54] <mikunos> wow thanks!
[04:06:47] <mikunos> shoky thx
[04:07:24] <shoky> np
[04:07:36] <mikunos> shoky just another question
[04:07:40] <mikunos> is there a way to reload the content by a simple click on a icon?
[04:08:17] <shoky> not sure what you mean by reload?
[04:08:31] <shoky> and mm you can do whatever you want in a click handler
[04:08:32] <mikunos> refresh the content
[04:08:40] <mikunos> of the widget
[04:08:40] <shoky> what does that mean?
[04:09:01] <shoky> you can make an ajax request and do whatever you want with the response, just like you're doing now on document ready
[04:09:23] <shoky> just do it in a click handler instead
[04:10:28] <mikunos> yes I need to load at the startup of the web page and sometime the data change in few minute and I would like to refresh the content of the widget without reloading all
[04:10:51] <shoky> ok, what's the problem?
[04:11:17] <mikunos> I don't understand how to include a refresh link
[04:11:30] <mikunos> and execute the refresh of the content
[04:12:13] <shoky> do you know how to make a link and add a click handler to it?
[04:12:42] <mikunos> http://jsfiddle.net/fb9rM/3/
[04:12:53] <k0bi> <shoky> is there somthing more that i can do in order it to work?
[04:13:10] <mikunos> http://jsfiddle.net/fb9rM/4/
[04:13:15] <shoky> k0bi: no idea
[04:13:28] <mikunos> there is a refresh css class on each widget
[04:13:40] <k0bi> wird
[04:13:48] <k0bi> i think it somthing with the iis
[04:13:59] <k0bi> cuz from http://jsfiddle.net server it all good
[04:15:35] <shoky> mikunos: example  http://jsfiddle.net/fb9rM/5/
[04:49:16] <k0bi> <shoky>  it works now with out jQuery.ajaxSetup({async:false}); jQuery.support.cors = true;
[04:50:21] <k0bi> the Q is if beforeunload will works ok without those lines
[04:51:08] <zedboy> I'm trying to fadeIn an element, and I find it only displays when its opacity is set to 1 (eg if I do .css('opacity',0.5).show(); it doesn't apear)
[06:13:33] <mikunos> just a question. Why the jQuery doesn't affect the html that comes from the ajax request? http://jsfiddle.net/fb9rM/7/
[06:14:02] <mikunos> $(".portlet") and  $(".widget-header .ui-icon").click(function() { ... } are not executed
[06:16:59] <mikunos> any idea?
[06:24:45] <mikunos> is there anybody there?
[06:25:40] <jphase> sorry, jumped in in the middle of that, what was the issue mikunos?
[06:25:56] <mikunos> hi jphase
[06:26:06] <mikunos>  Why the jQuery doesn't affect the html that comes from the ajax request? http://jsfiddle.net/fb9rM/7/
[06:26:07] <jphase> hi
[06:27:12] <jphase> mikunos: you'll have to rebind the events to the HTML after it's been parsed
[06:27:28] <mikunos> how have I to do it?
[06:28:02] <jphase> I'd suggest wrapping your click/hover/yaddayadda events inside a function, then calling that function after you've set the HTML from your response
[06:29:18] <jphase> so instead of the doc ready wrapper make like, function bindEvents(){    and then call bindEvents(); in a doc ready wrapper and also after your .html(data) is called
[06:30:05] <mikunos> look at http://demo.shineisp.com/admin
[06:30:46] <mikunos> user: info@shineisp.com
[06:30:50] <mikunos> pass: 123456789
[06:31:12] <mikunos> you will see the dashboard where I have created the widger
[06:31:15] <mikunos> widget
[06:31:25] <mikunos> management
[06:32:01] <jphase> k
[06:32:49] <mikunos> in this way ? --> widget.hide().html(data).bindEvents().fadeIn();
[06:33:14] <jphase> well you could do it that way, but then you'd need to extend jQuery to be able to chain like that
[06:33:33] <mikunos> what is the common way?
[06:34:16] <jphase> well I was suggesting just a quick work around, like this http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/fb9rM/8/
[06:35:08] <mikunos> it freeze chrome !
[06:35:31] <mikunos> it is loaded many times
[06:35:44] <mikunos> it appears and disappears
[06:36:07] <jphase> hmm, yeah noticed that after I posted it
[06:36:45] <jphase> it looks like there's a loop this way because createWidget() is called a bunch
[06:37:20] <jphase> http://jsfiddle.net/jphase/fb9rM/9/
[06:37:21] <jphase> try that maybe
[06:38:55] <mikunos> no the code isn't executed
[06:39:10] <dekiss2> why element is not starting at the top, it has position : absolute
[06:39:31] <mikunos> the  $(".portlet") prepend code is not executed
[06:41:29] <mikunos> jphase have you noticed it?
[06:41:39] <jphase> hmm, indeed
[06:42:09] <jphase> how are you getting your html from the server? can you build out your elements dynamically instead of from a string?
[06:44:53] <mikunos> I cannot include the plus and minus icon because there are different way to inject the html in the dashboard page
[06:45:23] <mikunos> jphase furthermore when I try to refresh the widget it must be executed
[06:45:46] <mikunos> and the plus/minus icon must be created again
[06:46:51] <shoky> mikunos http://jsfiddle.net/fb9rM/10/
[06:47:07] <shoky> use event delegation for event handling
[06:47:22] <shoky> read about it in the docs for .on
[06:48:55] <shoky> mikunos oops fixed smth  http://jsfiddle.net/fb9rM/12/
[06:49:39] <mikunos> let me see it
[06:53:58] <mikunos> in jsfiddle works
[06:54:03] <mikunos> not in my project
[06:54:21] <mikunos> I suppose that the drag and drop feature block the click
[06:54:23] <mikunos> event
[06:56:45] <shoky> `shrug
[06:56:45] <b-ot> shoky: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
[07:04:29] <mikunos> shoky seems that the refresh button doesn't works if you push it twice

[07:24:48] <shoky> not a testcase
[07:24:53] <dekiss> write jquery not animating top in chrome in google
[07:24:55] <dekiss> you will see
[07:25:00] <dekiss> how many reports are there
[07:25:05] <shoky> no testcase, no bug
[07:27:51] <jphase> dekiss: jQuery's .animate on top properties *does* work, so you'll need to setup a jsfiddle or something in order to get help on whatever weird css oddity or what-not you're encountering
[07:28:07] <jphase> it works in every browser that supports javascript
[07:28:46] <dekiss> I solved it
[07:29:02] <dekiss> chome has problems if you don't specify top for absolutely positioned element
[07:29:53] <shoky> your site has problems, you mean
[07:32:23] <dekiss> :)
[07:35:00] <dekiss> I am using offsetTop to animate top with jquery but the element is moving a little more then the browser top
[07:35:33] <shoky> `demo
[07:35:33] <b-ot> shoky: Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[07:40:37] <dekiss> shoky I can't post fiddle because it is a browser position in question..
[07:41:43] <shoky> as you wish
[07:41:48] <dekiss> tha padding is the problem :)
[07:41:56] <shoky> d'oh
[07:42:00] <dekiss> shoky but I am right no?
[07:42:09] <dekiss> Icant post jsfiddle when browser is in question man :S
[07:42:15] <shoky> how am i supposed to know? i haven't seen the problem
[07:42:25] <shoky> stop being a dumbass
[07:42:36] <dekiss> strange is that
[07:42:40] <shoky> making a jsfiddle is not too hard
[07:42:43] <dekiss> the element doesn't have padding top or bottom :S
[07:42:54] <dekiss> ok but it will not work
[07:42:57] <shoky> stfu
[07:45:59] <BIG_Yack> Seeking help with if statements (see code at http://jsfiddle.net/lukacvetko/4aqjg/). Why do I get "Invalid left-hand side in assignment" in debugger?
[07:46:59] <shoky> BIG_Yack: learn the difference between = and == or ===
[07:47:19] <shoky> BIG_Yack: = is for assigning a value
[07:47:29] <shoky> == and === are for comparing
[07:47:35] <BIG_Yack> do I need ===?
[07:47:49] <shoky> yes. but for the trivial case of === true  you can just leave it out
[07:48:10] <shoky> if ($("input[value='TrackID']").prop("checked")) { ... }
[07:51:00] <BIG_Yack> shaky, change applied and no error now. The sampleOutput variable is still empty. What's the best way to bind those if's to the form change event (to change the sampleOtuput variable each time the form is changed)?
[07:57:28] <shoky> BIG_Yack: forms don't have a change event, only the inputs do. you can bind to each with .on('change', function..  or you can delegate it to a container element like the form e.g. $('form').on('change', 'input', function() { ... })
[08:08:27] <frank_o> Hello! Trying to set up jQuery Infinite Scroll Helper: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/yn8Qs/
[08:08:29] <frank_o> But for each new batch of items, it will return the entire page (as raw HTML) including the previous/existing content, so the previous/existing content will also be infinitely repeated. Is there a way to prevent this?
[08:12:16] <BIG_Yack> shoky, is that correct? http://jsfiddle.net/lukacvetko/4aqjg/3/
[08:26:28] <shoky> BIG_Yack: it's full of errors, so probably no.  try http://jsfiddle.net/4aqjg/4/
[08:32:31] <BIG_Yack> shaky, thanks. Will compare and learn. A beginner in JS here :)
[08:33:02] <Steve132> Why would $.getJSON fail with a textStatus of "error" and a blank error code
[08:33:29] <Steve132> The docs say that can happen if you are doing a cross-domain request, but I am not.  My request starts at /
[08:34:24] <Steve132> Any ideas?
[08:34:58] <shoky> Steve132: and no error in console? what does the browser's network tab say about the request?
[08:35:19] <Steve132> http://pastebin.com/JSFR5dsE
[08:35:39] <Steve132> the browser's network tab shows that no request goes through
[08:35:44] <Steve132> like, no request is even attempted
[08:36:16] <oddalot> does error contain messages in it?
[08:36:20] <oddalot> is it an object?
[08:36:42] <Steve132> I don't know, I was following the code to debug jquery from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5492838/why-does-getjson-silently-fail
[08:37:05] <shoky> Steve132: running on a webserver?
[08:37:09] <oddalot> why not use console.log
[08:37:19] <oddalot> and then you can get at the error from your browser console
[08:37:29] <Steve132> shoky: running on localhost and on a webserver the result is the same
[08:38:04] <Steve132> oddalot: that's what I'm doing...I'm using "console.error" which is an alias
[08:38:17] <Steve132> and it outputs "getJSON failed, status: error, error: "
[08:38:32] <BIG_Yack> Shoky, tried with your code but now the "sampleOutput" variable is not defined.
[08:38:36] <oddalot> no
[08:38:43] <oddalot> don't convert the error to a string though
[08:38:45] <shoky> Steve132: i assume you've tried adding a success handler ;p
[08:38:49] <oddalot> just do console.log(error)
[08:38:54] <oddalot> and see what it contains
[08:39:00] <Steve132> oddalot:ok
[08:39:10] <shoky> oddalot it should be a string in any case
[08:39:26] <Steve132> shoky: I know from looking at the net tab that no request is made.  My server doesn't recieve the request
[08:39:32] <oddalot> oh
[08:39:42] <shoky> Steve132: what browser?
[08:39:46] <Steve132> shoky: and the failure case handler is activated, and it prints "getJSON failed, status: error, error: " to the console
[08:39:52] <Steve132> Firefox, Linux
[08:40:02] <shoky> ok, what happens on chrome
[08:40:36] <Steve132> shoky: I don't have chrome
[08:40:36] <Steve132> but
[08:40:38] <Steve132> I'll get it
[08:40:41] <Steve132> in the mean time
[08:40:45] <Steve132> I don't know if this matters
[08:40:58] <shoky> chrome sometimes gives more info about failing requests
[08:41:13] <Steve132> but there's something weird: if I put a document.write("DEBUG") call right before the $getJSON call
[08:41:28] <Steve132> then the document content is overwritten with that string
[08:41:39] <Steve132> and then the getJSON query works fine
[08:42:22] <shoky> no idea what to conclude from that
[08:42:32] <oddalot> lol
[08:42:40] <oddalot> well, keep that in then ;)
[08:43:13] <shoky> Steve132 if you set up a link we'll happily take a look
[08:43:57] <Steve132> shoky: I don't know if I can, like I said, its running on localhost
[08:44:06] <Steve132> furthermore, my client REALLY wants to keep it proprietary
[08:44:15] <Steve132> which is unfortunate
[08:44:25] <Steve132> I could try to reduce to a minimum failure case
[08:44:31] <Steve132> but first let me try chromium
[08:45:50] <Steve132> How do I see the console on chrome?
[08:46:02] <shoky> ctrl-shift-j  or f12
[08:46:03] <oddalot> shift control c
[08:46:03] <Steve132> I just tried loading the page and I don't see any logs whatsoever, even in the console
[08:49:16] <shoky> check network tab, add more logs, use debugger, etc.
[09:05:41] <BIG_Yack> shaky, still no luck with http://jsfiddle.net/4aqjg/4/ ... It appears that "change" is not a valid event for checkboxes ...
[09:11:03] <shoky> BIG_Yack: sure it is, the fiddle is working fine. are you looking at the js console?
[09:11:37] <joroci> why not valid/
[09:11:37] <joroci> ?

[09:31:44] <raj> hi Rohan_Bhangui
[09:31:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> nice timing
[09:32:11] <raj> you rang? :)
[09:32:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> many hours ago
[09:32:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[09:32:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> your here now
[09:32:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> im still stuck
[09:32:42] <raj> with?
[09:32:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> I need sortable tables via column and row for a tr-td html structure
[09:33:02] <raj> oh, never tried that
[09:33:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> backwards compatibility
[09:33:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> is not a problem
[09:33:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> its an internal project
[09:33:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> all modern systems
[09:33:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> all webkit
[09:33:22] <raj> backwards compatibility of what is not a problem?
[09:33:28] <raj> oh
[09:33:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: i was looking i nto this: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/
[09:33:43] <raj> why not just use a jquery table plugin?
[09:33:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> i tried
[09:34:01] <raj> and?
[09:34:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> none of them suit me
[09:34:06] <raj> why not?
[09:34:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> i even tried jquery ui
[09:34:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> stripped down, without any css
[09:34:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> just events
[09:34:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> and that didnt work
[09:34:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> cuase its structure dependant
[09:34:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> so i either get sortable tables or sortable columns
[09:36:04] <raj> there are multiple jquery plugins that allow sorting of columns
[09:36:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: the keyword is both
[09:36:30] <raj> how do you sort the table?
[09:36:42] <raj> table sorting is just column sorting anyway
[09:36:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> what i mean by column sortable
[09:36:57] <raj> oh, you mean it doesn't keep the row in tact?
[09:37:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> is like I should be able to drag columns
[09:37:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then reorder them
[09:37:18] <raj> ya
[09:37:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then i also need the functionality
[09:37:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> to drag and reorder rows
[09:37:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i cant have both with sortables
[09:38:56] <raj> Rohan_Bhangui, jquery datatables can do all of the above
[09:39:02] <Rohan_Bhangui> link?
[09:39:05] <raj> http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/basic_init/table_sorting.html
[09:39:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> i might see how they do it
[09:39:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i prefer writing it myself
[09:39:28] <yellow1> guys can i ask you something
[09:39:34] <yellow1> does this "work " for you
[09:39:35] <raj> and ColReorder plugin for jquery datatables here http://datatables.net/extras/
[09:39:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> yellow1: no
[09:39:37] <yellow1> http://sharrre.com/example4.html
[09:39:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> yellow1: jks
[09:39:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> just ask bro :)
[09:39:50] <yellow1> its a social plugin for your website
[09:39:52] <raj> yellow1, yes
[09:40:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj : i dont see reorderable columns
[09:40:17] <yellow1> so you guys can "see " a facebook button and a tweeter button ?
[09:40:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> nvm
[09:41:45] <raj> yellow1, no, I see a pie chart
[09:41:48] <yellow1> raj so it works ,right ? because somehow i cant see a "facebook like button" there ... i dont know why?
[09:42:00] <raj> I don't see any Like buttons, no
[09:42:10] <yellow1> raj what about this one : http://sharrre.com/example5.html
[09:42:20] <raj> yes, I see them there
[09:42:40] <yellow1> and this one too ? http://sharrre.com/example1.html
[09:42:57] <raj> yes
[09:43:00] <yellow1> raj so you can see a "facebook like button"
[09:43:22] <yellow1> why doesnt that work for me ,i dont understand ,am i doing something wrong ?
[09:43:32] <yellow1> is my browser faulty?
[09:43:43] <raj> Chrome, latest
[09:44:05] <yellow1> i am checking it on firefox ,lets see if that works on chrome ...
[09:44:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: fricken fonts so irritating in chrome
[09:44:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> i cant beleive a less popular browser like opera got it right
[09:44:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> so frustrating
[09:44:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> and the webkit-text-stroke
[09:44:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> hack doesnt work any more cause oepra has also switched to webkit
[09:45:04] <yellow1> oh yes ,its the browser something isn't going well with firefox..
[09:46:39] <yellow1> could someone test that on firefox if that works on firefox as well ?
[09:46:45] <yellow1> http://sharrre.com/example1.html
[09:57:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> raj: a quick query perhaps
[09:58:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> is there a way by which i can add elements to the current drag
[09:58:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> that is if I am dragging an element
[09:58:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase: you up?
[09:58:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: HEY

[10:25:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jt5NSyu8dXI
[10:25:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: ^
[10:26:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> also after that I have a question
[10:26:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> programming stuff
[10:27:47] <grafi> what the draggable thing you asked earlier?
[10:27:52] <grafi> if have no idea :P
[10:28:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> awwwww
[10:28:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> fuck
[10:28:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> its there
[10:28:36] <Rohan_Bhangui> i know its possible
[10:28:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> the html5 api allows it
[10:28:46] <grafi> what are you doing?
[10:28:46] <grafi> ^^
[10:28:55] <Rohan_Bhangui> i just need to be able to add toher targets to the overlay
[10:29:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> well im trying to build from scratch (because you know how i operate ;)  ) a column sortable (drag a column and reorder) table with a tr-td structure
[10:29:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi^
[10:30:24] <grafi> shouldnt that be pretty easy with jquery oô adding stuff to stuff
[10:30:26] <grafi> stuff
[10:30:28] <grafi> :D
[10:33:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: also must watch
[10:33:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://youtu.be/vi7SeBI7z9A
[10:33:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: thank you for beign so specific
[10:34:04] <grafi> your most welcome
[10:34:05] <grafi> :P
[10:34:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> watch the youtube vid and then i have antoher question
[10:34:24] <grafi> whats that
[10:34:28] <grafi> a one man boy band?
[10:34:29] <grafi> oô
[10:35:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> just watch the entire thing from the point i set
[10:35:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> its absolutely funny
[10:35:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> its a build up
[10:35:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi^
[10:35:47] <grafi> starts from the start for me
[10:35:50] <grafi> le video
[10:36:25] <grafi> 8minutes seems like too much commitment
[10:37:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> hold let me get you link form the point i want
[10:38:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: try this http://youtu.be/vi7SeBI7z9A?t=5m50s (and understand the contents of the vid, by no means do I share the views presented)
[10:43:41] <grafi> funny how he doesnt sound like hitler at all xD
[10:43:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> what
[10:43:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> i would say its a decent impression
[10:43:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> anyways
[10:44:02] <grafi> nah
[10:44:06] <grafi> :P
[10:44:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> i foudn out you can probably bind data to event
[10:44:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> but i cant seem to find definitive solution
[10:44:25] <grafi> huh?
[10:44:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> im talkinga bout my issue now
[10:44:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> i need to be able to add data to my events
[10:45:01] <grafi> when you trigger them?
[10:45:09] <grafi> or are they user triggered
[10:45:10] <Rohan_Bhangui> ondrag start
[10:45:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[10:45:31] <grafi> ... or ... ? yes
[10:45:32] <grafi> nice
[10:45:33] <grafi> :D
[10:45:42] <Rohan_Bhangui> ???
[10:45:58] <grafi> so user triggered then
[10:46:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[10:46:09] <grafi> and what data would you want to attach oô
[10:46:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> so
[10:46:28] <Rohan_Bhangui> since my table is set up in a tr-td structure
[10:46:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> there is no way of getting columns
[10:46:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> so I sohuld be able to add a selector
[10:46:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> that gets all the elements
[10:46:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> and drags those
[10:46:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> with the current drag
[10:47:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> and when i say all the elements
[10:47:09] <grafi> so you want to be able to drag columns around
[10:47:13] <grafi> freajy
[10:47:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> i mean the ones the selector defines
[10:47:17] <grafi> freaky*
[10:47:17] <grafi> ^^
[10:47:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> *freely
[10:47:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes
[10:47:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol freaky :P
[10:47:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> im working with this api
[10:47:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/
[10:48:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi ^that may answer alot as to how im approaching this
[10:50:16] <grafi> huh for a moment i thought you were using jqui's draggable stuff ^^
[10:50:19] <grafi> but ok .P
[11:03:12] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was
[11:03:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> i was actually using jquery sortables
[11:03:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> but there aremany restrictions
[11:03:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> such as sortables is bound to the html structure
[11:03:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> so if i do a column-cell strucute
[11:03:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> i cant osrt rows
[11:03:51] <Rohan_Bhangui> and by sort rows
[11:03:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> take a catergory
[11:04:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> labeled in a column and sort ascending and desceding
[11:04:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi ^  (also are you signed into irc somewhere else)
[11:07:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: also I am assuming our mission to create a front end flat design framework is losing fuel ? :P
[11:10:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi  ?
[11:18:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi, grafi_
[11:18:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> Velveeta:

[11:19:13] <MagePsycho> hi guys, can you suggest me the best jquery overlay for newsletter popup, promotional offers
[11:27:20] <grafi> what what what Rohan_Bhangui
[11:27:31] <grafi> Just not able to do it fulltime :P
[11:27:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think I might have figured it out
[11:27:33] <grafi> be patient :P
[11:27:36] <grafi> wohooo
[11:27:37] <grafi> ^^
[11:27:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: we have spent past 3 weeks and have done nothing
[11:27:52] <grafi> so?
[11:27:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay back to my solution
[11:28:01] <grafi> :P
[11:28:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> I just need to understand better how drag and drop works
[11:28:22] <grafi> have fun reading ^^
[11:28:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> cause I can change event targets
[11:28:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> its actually looking at the console thats helping me
[11:28:49] <grafi> you can change event targets?
[11:28:54] <grafi> that sounds cool
[11:29:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> well yes and no
[11:29:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> yes you can change them, but I do not know for usre
[11:29:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> and that is where I need your help kinda
[11:31:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> what I need is a way by which i know that the target has changed
[11:31:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> so way I can add a visual
[11:33:54] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: cause visually when you use drag and drop you should see like a watermark like image attached to your mouse which tells you that something is being dragged
[11:34:59] <grafi> hm
[11:35:11] <grafi> sounds complicated :P
[11:36:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> well not so
[11:36:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> if I can chagne the target
[11:36:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> the visual should chang
[11:36:33] <Rohan_Bhangui> I just cant change the event successfully
[11:42:30] <javalover> aight #css is dead so....   I set everything to 100% width, so that my content could fill the window width.    But this causes glitches when I switch to a new tab as it has to adjust everything.... any thoughts on how to fix this glitch? is there a better way to fill the window with content?
[11:45:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: its pretty dead here too
[11:46:14] <javalover> any thoughts rohan?
[11:46:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> fiddle?
[11:46:26] <javalover> like how would you do a full screen
[11:46:29] <javalover> i can't fiddle this too much to load
[11:46:35] <javalover> but i just want my content to fit window
[11:46:48] <javalover> i'm using width:100%;  but is there an alternative?
[11:46:56] <javalover> cuz this causes a glitch when loading new tabs...
[11:48:59] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: oooooooooooooo
[11:49:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> i think i might have figured it out
[11:49:13] <Rohan_Bhangui> i might be accessing the wrong event
[11:49:27] <grafi> ^^
[11:50:14] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: im thinking
[11:50:18] <Rohan_Bhangui> if you lfoat your tabs left
[11:50:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> you might find a solution
[11:50:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> but then again
[11:50:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> unless I see a screenshot of interface I cannot definitetively comment
[11:50:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> javalover: ^
[11:51:06] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: i was accessing event, I need to access datatransfer objecyt

[11:53:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> grafi: how do you access event for a drag event
[11:53:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> well access event options
[11:53:58] <Mattx> Hello!
[11:54:27] <Mattx> how do you create a cross domain ajax request with basic auth?
[11:54:59] <Mattx> I tried with username and password arguments of .ajax but jquery doesn't even try to use them
[12:00:03] <grafi> probably because its cross domain
[12:00:25] <grafi> Mattx look into CORS to get started
[12:00:41] <Mattx> I did
[12:00:55] <Mattx> and I found some examples on the Internet but none of them work
[12:01:31] <Mattx> most of them proposed adding   xhrFields: { withCredentials: true }, username: "foo", password: "bar"
[12:01:39] <Mattx> with is something suggested in the documentation
[12:02:56] <grafi> then I dont know I have played around with CORS, but never autheticated
[12:03:09] <Mattx> yeah, same here
[12:03:52] <Mattx> it's weird because if you check the request jquery does, it's clear .ajax completely ignores the authentication

[12:51:43] <Whirl3d> Hey all. Simple question I can't wrap my head around: I need to select all elements in a certain class that do not contain an input:focus child element.
[12:53:15] <Whirl3d> var fields=$(".formField"); fields.not(fields.find("input:focus").parent()).removeClass("active");
[12:53:43] <shoky> oi Whirl3d
[12:53:52] <Whirl3d> shoky! It's been a while.
[12:54:06] <shoky> a couple weeks ;p
[12:54:23] <shoky> how'ssup
[12:54:30] <Whirl3d> since I have been really working with Jquery....I feel like I forgot how to ride a bike sometimes
[12:54:34] <shoky> heh
[12:54:42] <shoky> you'd need to give an example of the html
[12:55:04] <shoky> what's .formField, are the inputs really direct children, etc
[12:56:59] <shoky> but mm  $(".formField:not(:has(input:focus))")  might work ;p
[12:58:37] <shoky> and for flexibility you can always specify a function in filters:  $(".formField").filter(function(){ return $(this).children('input:focus').length === 0 })
[12:58:45] <shoky> same for .not()
[13:01:00] <javalover> wait shoky & whril3d online SUP!!! FAM!!!
[13:01:41] <javalover> you guys really helped my site a long time ago
[13:02:32] <shoky> \o
[13:09:23] <Whirl3d> hey javalover, how goes it?
[13:09:45] <Whirl3d> You rich and famous yet? Hunting us down to shower us with cash for helping you?
[13:10:07] <javalover> hahhaa
[13:10:08] <javalover> maybe
[14:05:25] <ajustrun> how do i call a javascript method in the chrom console? i tried getMaster(); but it says referenceerror getmaster is not defined
[15:48:57] <scipy53> I'm having a lot of trouble jquery's ajax. I make a call, and inside the success I add the response I get to the dom via $("#container").html(response);  ... it gets added. Right below it, I call a function which operates on some elements in the dom, but I get errors saying that it can't find those elements.
[15:49:44] <scipy53> If I run that same line of code afterward again (through firebug), nothing else has changed, then it works fine and is able to find the elements. What's going on here?
[15:51:43] <jrajav> You are probably referencing the elements or one of your variables incorrectly. It's hard to tell without seeing a working example of your problem on something like jsfiddle
[15:51:51] <scipy53> right
[15:51:57] <scipy53> actually i think i may have figured this out
[15:53:15] <zumba_addict> hey guys if you created a wizard instructions in modal window(3 steps), how would you monitor each step?
[15:53:46] <zumba_addict> I mean, there is a Next and Back button to get to the next page and previous page
[15:58:37] <scipy53> jrajav, So it seems like the problem had to do with the fact that I faded out my element, changed the html in it after the fadeout was completed via the call back, and then tried to play with the new elements while it was in a faded out state. It doesn't seem to work until it fades back in. Any idea why this may be?
[16:00:28] <scipy53> Basically I can't access the dom after I fade out, until I fade back in
[16:01:19] <jrajav> scipy53: If you stored any references that you got with selectors before setting the new html, those references will be outdated and won't work anymore
[16:02:03] <scipy53> jrajav, Hmm ok, but i didnt do that
[16:03:10] <jrajav> I don't know how your fadeout operation is working, but perhaps it does not actually add the new html tree to the DOM before it fades back in?
[16:03:22] <jrajav> If that's the case and you do not scope your selectors to the tree, they will not find anything
[16:03:40] <jrajav> Unscoped selectors work on the document node and won't find DOM nodes that haven't been added yet
[16:04:19] <jrajav> By scoping I mean if you have an element that you created but didn't yet add to the DOM - say, $el - and you do a selector like so: $('.foo', $el)
[16:06:23] <scipy53> that's not it, i fixed it in a really lame way by doing this
[16:07:39] <scipy53> after fading out, i added the html on the call back, then after adding the html, i did: $("#main-content-container").show().css("visibility", "hidden"); ... then I was able to access the dom no problem
[16:13:35] <zumba_addict> how is jquery able to update the dom properly when our input is an object? for example $('#someId').html(someObject)
[16:13:53] <zumba_addict> when I look at the value of someObject, it is huge
[16:14:05] <zumba_addict> but only displays a single line on screen
[16:16:33] <jrajav> scipy53: That seems a little hacky
[16:17:14] <jrajav> scipy53: You should try scoping to #main-content-container like I was saying (instead of trying to get to the elements on the DOM), just see if it works. It would be better than briefly showing the element
[16:21:32] <freebirD2> you guys, I've this code, works fine, but I want to be able to have the radio button selected when I click in the other rows as well, please, help http://jsfiddle.net/U6PjL/22/
[16:22:00] <scipy53> jrajav, Will try, thanks
[16:27:09] <freebirD2> please, anyone could give it a look for me please

[16:42:37] <Siecje> how can I get a child element with id that starts with a string?

[17:41:26] <Siecje> ali4ever4: http://jsfiddle.net/b2Y2X/4/ I figured it out! Is there a better solution?
[17:53:44] <ali4ever4> Siecje: nice I never knew of ^=
[17:55:26] <Siecje> ali4ever4: I feel like getting the parent and using find like that is awkward though.
[17:59:11] <zumba_addict> is hasClass a jquery function?
[17:59:28] <dblosevn> zumba_addict: yes but .is looks nicer :-)
[17:59:35] <zumba_addict> oh ok
[17:59:44] <dblosevn> $(selector).is('.myclass)
[17:59:47] <zumba_addict> i'm actually debugging a code which was rwritten by my officemate
[18:00:03] <zumba_addict> so .is can be used to check class if it exists
[18:00:29] <dblosevn> ya but it can be used for more then just classes
[18:00:30] <zumba_addict> any advantage of .is versus hasClass?
[18:00:52] <zumba_addict> will our code break if I replace hasClass with is?
[18:01:10] <dblosevn> if $('input[name="sex"]).is(':checked')
[18:01:35] <zumba_addict> checked is for checkbox right?
[18:01:42] <dblosevn> or radio
[18:01:56] <zumba_addict> so that means, that if will return false
[18:02:15] <dblosevn> if it is not is will return false
[18:02:34] <zumba_addict> I mean, the "IF" statement you wrote above will return false since it's an input
[18:02:45] <dblosevn> but to replace hasClass with .is you need to add a . before the classname as hasClass expects a string classname and .is requires a selector
[18:03:19] <zumba_addict> so .is('.backlink')
[18:03:26] <dblosevn> ya
[18:03:29] <zumba_addict> cool
[18:03:50] <dblosevn> .is is just a little more powerful eing you can use any jquery selector in your test
[18:03:56] <dblosevn> *being
[18:04:05] <zumba_addict> although hasClass is more clearer since we are checking if the class contains it
[18:04:11] <zumba_addict> ah
[18:04:26] <dblosevn> vs hasClass only has one behavior
[18:04:46] <zumba_addict> so other than ".is, .hasClass", where can I find other functions? Are there any documentation?
[18:09:03] <dblosevn> whats nice is you can turn this if ($(this).hasClass('backlink') && $(this).hasClass('partner)) into if ($(this).is('.backlink.partner')
[18:09:47] <dblosevn> `api on
[18:09:48] <b-ot> dblosevn: .on(): Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[18:09:57] <dblosevn> `api hasClass
[18:09:57] <b-ot> dblosevn: .hasClass(): Determine whether any of the matched elements are assigned the given class. http://api.jquery.com/hasClass/
[18:10:09] <dblosevn> `api is
[18:10:09] <b-ot> dblosevn: .is(): Check the current matched set of elements against a selector, element, or jQuery object and return <code>true</code> if at least one of these elements matches the given arguments. http://api.jquery.com/is/
[18:10:24] <dblosevn> sorry dont know where on came from lol
[18:12:01] <zumba_addict> very cool
[18:12:33] <zumba_addict> what's the difference between if ($(this).is('.backlink.partner') and if ($(this).is('.backlink .partner')
[18:12:48] <dblosevn> well quite a bit actually
[18:12:55] <zumba_addict> class="backlink partner" which one will get called
[18:13:08] <dblosevn> .backlink.partner means this element has both cliasses
[18:13:15] <zumba_addict> ok
[18:13:39] <dblosevn> .backlink .partner means this element has the class partner and one of its parents has the class backlink
[18:14:09] <zumba_addict> ah like <div class="backlink"><div class="partner"> ....
[18:14:14] <dblosevn> yes
[18:14:17] <zumba_addict> cool
[18:14:39] <zumba_addict> btw, have you heard of backboneJS?
[18:14:48] <dblosevn> yep havent got to play with it yet
[18:14:52] <zumba_addict> k
[18:15:11] <zumba_addict> we have this code, @$('#wizard-step').html(@currentView().render().el)
[18:15:13] <dblosevn> ive been playing with writing my own router
[18:15:34] <zumba_addict> i'm so very confused about the input which is @currentView().render().el
[18:15:57] <zumba_addict> @currentViews() is a function that returns an object
[18:15:57] <b-ot> zumba_addict: memorised “currentViews()”.
[18:16:06] <dblosevn> console.log(@currentview)
[18:16:15] <zumba_addict> yup, i did that and it's an object
[18:16:37] <zumba_addict> but I am wondering how jquery displays only the required string eventhough that object is huge
[18:17:10] <dblosevn> well im sure @currentview().render.el is one html element
[18:17:45] <zumba_addict> yes, you are right
[18:17:58] <zumba_addict> but how was it able to convert it as an html element?
[18:18:02] <dblosevn> so jquery in simply appending that el to @currentview
[18:18:25] <zumba_addict> so looks like it's the backboneJS that converts it to html
[18:18:31] <dblosevn> im sure el already is an html elemnt
[18:18:42] <zumba_addict> k
[18:19:00] <zumba_addict> i thought el was a function on that code
[18:19:05] <zumba_addict> i was wrong then
[18:19:48] <dblosevn> usually about everything in js if it has the memeber name el its usuallyt safe to assume its an html element
[18:20:01] <zumba_addict> k
[18:20:43] <zumba_addict> wow, I changed the code from
[18:20:56] <zumba_addict> @$('#wizard-step').html(@currentView().render().el) to
[18:21:05] <zumba_addict> @$('#wizard-step').html(@currentView().rendersecond().el) and it failed
[18:21:17] <zumba_addict> i actually made a copy first of render function
[18:21:38] <zumba_addict> so looks like it's not calling the render that is hardcoded on that file
[18:21:44] <dblosevn> no clue what renderscond is
[18:22:40] <zumba_addict> sorry dboskovic, I received a automated response
[18:23:01] <zumba_addict> i didn't want to paste the main code as I was thinking that my officemate might be here, I'm a bit paranoid :)
[18:23:06] <dblosevn> ya
[18:23:22] <zumba_addict> i sent you a pm and I got an automated response :)
[18:23:25] <dblosevn> I get pms but the auto responder deters peops from pming me
[18:23:57] <zumba_addict> so in the file that I am working on, there is a hardcoded render function

[18:55:11] <dblosevn> is there anytime in js where an object can become immutable?
[18:55:52] <dblosevn> Ive got a weird issue with an object, where I can change one of its members in the console and log it back immedialy afterward and it has the previous value
[18:56:40] <dblosevn> eg... core.pref.units = 'US'; console.log(core.pref.units) => 'EU'
[18:57:55] <dblosevn> but core.pref = {units: 'US'} changes the object oviously I dont want to overrite the entire object to change one member though :-(
[18:58:29] <dblosevn> but another thing thats weird is if I overwrite the object I can then change its members
[19:01:52] <Blok> I have an <ul> with a bunch of <li> elements that I fill with a header and lots of large graphs. I want to be able to "fold" the li so it only displays the header. My first idea was slideToggle(), but that makes the li collapse completly. Any ideas of how to solve this by just making it partially collapsed?
[19:03:05] <dblosevn> Blok: add a wrapper around the content you want to collapse below the header and slideToggle that
[19:03:14] <ali4ever4> Blok: animate and change the hight and make overflow hidden
[19:03:50] <dblosevn> that works too if the height of the header is fixed
[19:08:08] <frank_o> Can somebody help me integrate infinite scrolling at http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/SC8zT/? Almost working, just not sure how to get it to fetch content from an external fiddle.
[19:16:25] <Blok> dblosevn: Worked perfectly. Thank you and also thanks to ali4ever4! It looks so nice now :)
[19:16:45] <dblosevn> :-)
[19:16:51] <dsl2> is there a jquery boolean search available? couldnt find one..
[19:17:34] <dblosevn> dsl2: not understanding what your looking for
[19:18:52] <dsl2> dblosevn, something like -> http://anthonybush.com/projects/jquery_fast_live_filter/demo/ but with AND OR functionality
[19:20:21] <dblosevn> oh got ya
[19:21:36] <SirScott> got a bit of a newb question that I apologize in advance for... I've got a function to resize some divs in $(window).load as well as $(document).ready.  In Chrome, no problem.  In IE11, the first time I load the page it doesn't seem to fire, but if I F5 it, then it does what it's supposed to.
[19:22:05] <SirScott> Should I be putting this function somewhere else for IE11?
[19:22:45] <dblosevn> ds12: I figured out a way to do it with 2 lines of code
[19:23:47] <dblosevn> creating a fiddle
[19:25:13] <dsl2> dblosevn, can you explan it pls?
[19:25:29] <dblosevn> ds12: im making you a fiddle
[19:29:57] <dblosevn> ds12: http://jsfiddle.net/LKt3s/
[19:30:48] <dblosevn> Its not case insensitive though working on that
[19:31:24] <dblosevn> dont think it can be and remain that simple
[19:32:37] <dsl2> should it already work in the result box?
[19:34:27] <dblosevn> ds12: http://jsfiddle.net/LKt3s/1/ I lied I made it insensitive
[19:34:42] <dblosevn> ya
[19:34:46] <dblosevn> should work great
[19:36:22] <dsl2> if I search "Alice Wonderland" theres no output
[19:37:02] <dblosevn> well that would require more then a boolean search, it would require a relevantcy search
[19:37:18] <dsl2> oh
[19:37:34] <dsl2> sry thats what i meant..
[19:37:49] <dblosevn> thats better done on the backend
[19:37:55] <dblosevn> it would be way too slow in js
[19:38:33] <dsl2> hm
[19:38:52] <dsl2> is there any other method to do this in a browser?
[19:39:03] <frank_o> dsl2: i did something similar recently with https://github.com/brianreavis/sifter.js
[19:39:19] <frank_o> maybe you can too shrug i dunno
[19:41:26] <dsl2> but its not client only?
[19:41:42] <dsl2> maybe this gets too complicated..
[19:47:47] <dsl2> i found fuse.js
[19:47:53] <dsl2> maybe it works..
[19:53:45] <SirScott> anyone with IE11 able to help figure out why this doesn't render correctly until after you manually refresh the page?: http://dev.crrr.org/dogs/available/

[19:59:50] <HQRaja> Hehe nope...just random order
[20:00:14] <HQRaja> Oh and used arrays, as you suggested
[20:00:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> okay so :before and after seems like a bad idea
[20:00:19] <Rohan_Bhangui> nice
[20:00:25] <Rohan_Bhangui> so bascially what you should do
[20:00:31] <Rohan_Bhangui> is control the game from the js
[20:00:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> try to do it via js only
[20:00:43] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then use html as an output
[20:00:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> youll have better control that way
[20:00:58] <Rohan_Bhangui> so basically when a box is clicked
[20:01:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> register it into the js first and then send the appropriate html to the clicked box
[20:01:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: ^
[20:01:37] <HQRaja> upon click, it should add the character via JS rather than via assigning the cs:before class?
[20:01:52] <HQRaja> css*
[20:02:13] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: ^
[20:02:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> ya cause :before is giving you weird behaiour
[20:02:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> *behaviour
[20:02:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> just trust
[20:02:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> try to do the game via js
[20:02:46] <Rohan_Bhangui> only
[20:02:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> and then use htmlas output
[20:02:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> *html as
[20:02:56] <Rohan_Bhangui> ^ HQRaja
[20:02:58] <HQRaja> ok lemme try
[20:03:01] <HQRaja> Thanks :)
[20:03:07] <alturic> hey guys I got a jquery question and I'm pulling my hair out trying to figure out why it's not working exactly. It works on the else part, but not the if part... http://jsfiddle.net/zTbKL/
[20:03:38] <Rohan_Bhangui> alturic: you havent loaded jquery library and there is no html
[20:04:03] <alturic> It's there trust me, what I'm getting at is the snippet itself doesn't "function" correctly.
[20:04:18] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: Err...wait. I messed the size up
[20:04:22] <alturic> It does what I want it to do for browsers under 767, but not if they are over 767
[20:04:24] <HQRaja> In what I showed you
[20:06:23] <Rohan_Bhangui> alturic: you are giving me a snippet, can you provide perhaps some html and css and simulate your issue
[20:06:26] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: sure
[20:06:26] <alturic> The function is huge... here's the beginning of the snippet to show you how it's "works" http://jsfiddle.net/zTbKL/1/
[20:06:33] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: http://jsfiddle.net/HQRaja/VVWnq/3/
[20:06:44] <HQRaja> Still using :before BTW
[20:06:50] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: cool
[20:06:57] <HQRaja> Just changed the size of the dots and crosses
[20:07:01] <Rohan_Bhangui> ther reason why I am askign you to try to control logic from js only first
[20:07:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> is its another way to attack the problem
[20:07:10] <HQRaja> I forgot to readjust that when pasting into jsfiddle
[20:07:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[20:07:20] <HQRaja> Yeah I understand...that would be a better way :)
[20:07:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> it makes it cleaner
[20:07:31] <HQRaja> *nods*
[20:11:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[20:14:59] <alturic> Rohan_Bhangui: Basically, from a syntax standpoint, there's nothing "wrong" from stopping the code to work, no? As I said it's definitely "working" as it applies the width() - 40 aspect to ANY screen size...
[20:15:40] <Rohan_Bhangui> alturic: sry, what was the intended behaviour
[20:15:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> and what is happening
[20:15:54] <alturic> http://jsfiddle.net/zTbKL/
[20:16:03] <Rohan_Bhangui> alturic
[20:16:08] <Rohan_Bhangui> could it be possible
[20:16:21] <jphase> hi, was afk sorry
[20:16:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> that its already calculating the width
[20:16:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> and recalculating with resize
[20:16:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> jphase
[20:16:44] <Rohan_Bhangui> have an interesting issue
[20:16:47] <Rohan_Bhangui> that i cant figure out
[20:16:49] <Rohan_Bhangui> http://jsfiddle.net/zTbKL/1/
[20:16:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> its actually
[20:17:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> alturic 's issue
[20:18:10] <alturic> Basically the syntax looks correct... if window > 767 do X else do Y and it's applying the Y always and only regardless of screensize.
[20:18:19] <frank_o> Why does jQuery Infinite Scroll Helper keep repeating the same page over and over while regular pagination with Kaminari works just fine? https://github.com/frankie-loves-jesus/proper-infinite-scrolling/blob/master/app/assets/javascripts/application.js
[20:21:24] <jphase> alturic: debouncedresize is a jQuery plugin not a native event to my knowledge
[20:21:44] <alturic> Yea I'm beginning to think that's jacking me all up. :P
[20:22:14] <jphase> you could pretty easily write something like this with the native resize event though
[20:23:56] <jphase> and I'm pretty sure .browser is deprecated too btw
[20:44:43] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui, jphase: http://jsfiddle.net/HQRaja/6fUkM/ =)
[20:45:04] <jphase> nice, looks finished
[20:45:07] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: one last tweak, for the cursor for each box
[20:45:11] <Rohan_Bhangui> put
[20:45:17] <Rohan_Bhangui> cursor: default
[20:45:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> or cursor: pointer
[20:45:28] <HQRaja> jphase: Yup...I figured out the divisioning too, finally.
[20:45:54] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: cursor for each box as in?
[20:46:11] <HQRaja> Like a blinking cursor inside the boxes?
[20:46:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> no
[20:46:29] <Rohan_Bhangui> to each box
[20:46:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> add the following line
[20:46:37] <Rohan_Bhangui> cursor: pointer
[20:46:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> cursor: pointer;
[20:46:49] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: I mean to ask...what would that do?
[20:46:57] <Rohan_Bhangui> youll see
[20:47:09] <Rohan_Bhangui> instead of the cursor beign one that makes look like text is editable
[20:47:12] <HQRaja> Oh got it
[20:47:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> it gives it a pointer hand
[20:47:20] <Rohan_Bhangui> that makes it look nice
[20:47:22] <HQRaja> =)
[20:47:27] <Rohan_Bhangui> just a small tweak :)
[20:47:28] <HQRaja> Thanks...yup that does look better!
[20:47:52] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: your reset stopped working
[20:47:53] <Rohan_Bhangui> btw
[20:48:04] <HQRaja> reset?
[20:48:15] <Rohan_Bhangui> the reset button
[20:48:29] <HQRaja> Oh yeah...lemme fix that
[20:48:32] <HQRaja> Thanks
[20:49:00] <Rohan_Bhangui> np
[20:49:29] <HQRaja> it stopped working because I forgot to add code to remove the dots and crosses that were added by javascript and no longer by CSS
[20:51:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> ahhhh
[20:51:21] <Rohan_Bhangui> thats a simple case
[20:51:22] <Rohan_Bhangui> of .html("");
[20:51:26] <HQRaja> Yup
[20:51:55] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: Also, I decided to add cursor: pointer; to the unplayed class only
[20:52:04] <HQRaja> Looks even better. :)
[20:54:32] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: good
[20:54:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: out of curiousity, is this some sort of practice for you, or ?
[20:55:13] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: Yup...part of learning how to code. =)
[20:55:30] <Rohan_Bhangui> lol
[20:55:35] <Rohan_Bhangui> nice choice of project i guess
[20:55:41] <Rohan_Bhangui> here ill show you somethign
[20:55:45] <Rohan_Bhangui> to update your html stuff
[20:55:51] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: Thanks...and sure.
[20:56:16] <Rohan_Bhangui> HQRaja: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5/HTML5_element_list
[20:56:24] <Rohan_Bhangui> its a list of html5 tags that are introduced
[20:56:34] <Rohan_Bhangui> you should also look at a site called html5 rocks
[20:56:39] <Rohan_Bhangui> which looks into some new html5 apis
[20:57:03] <HQRaja> Rohan_Bhangui: I see...thanks, lemme look into both :)
[21:00:31] <ali4ever4> HQRaja: nice really cool
[21:00:50] <HQRaja> ali4ever4: Thanks =)
[21:00:59] <HQRaja> OK here's the final version now
[21:01:01] <HQRaja> http://jsfiddle.net/HQRaja/WnDb5/
[21:01:39] <HQRaja> Later everyone
[21:28:30] <frank_o> Why does jQuery Infinite Scroll Helper return the current page as `data`? http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/SC8zT/
[21:28:33] <frank_o> It should try to get the *next* page, but fail since I'm not able to emulate pagination in JSFiddle. Any clues?
[21:36:03] <GoSox> So I am having a very strange problem with a very simple jquery script. It's jquery 2, and the problem (of course) only occures in IE9 and 10. If you type a number into the text field, and hit return, the whole browser gets redirected spontaneously to a new page
[21:36:15] <GoSox> I boiled it down to a very easy test page here: http://www.whatsmyip.org/port-scanner/bugtest.php
[21:37:08] <GoSox> I can't figure out what is causing the redirects, or how to stop it. I figured a .preventDefault(); was sure to stop it.... nope
[21:41:17] <jphase> GoSox: out of curiosity, have you tried return false; instead?
[21:41:34] <GoSox> returning it where, exactly?
[21:41:43] <jphase> as opposed to e.preventDefault();
[21:41:48] <GoSox> oh
[21:42:17] <GoSox> well no, although i don't even understand what woudl cause a redirect in the first place. There is no link at all between the #server_scan button and the #single_scan button
[21:42:19] <GoSox> but ill try hold on
[21:42:50] <GoSox> nope, no change
[21:42:54] <jphase> hmm, yeah it's odd since I don't even see a <form> element here
[21:43:05] <GoSox> there are none
[21:43:12] <GoSox> just some javascript activated buttons
[21:43:58] <daniel3> Hello, I have a quick question.  I upgraded my site to the latest version of jQuery, and where my nav bar is, the menu drop downs dont fade out like they should when losing focus.  The site is http://ircdriven.com/ which can you see the problem when hovering over "Networks" or "Channels", the code for this is http://dpaste.com/1519374/
[21:44:00] <jphase> GoSox: you tried replacing your submit input with something that wouldn't normally submit, like a div or something?
[21:44:05] <daniel3> Just wondering if anyone can give me some direction
[21:45:18] <GoSox> well, no i haven't. but i like using real buttons
[21:47:08] <jphase> GoSox: I'm just wondering if IE is submitting that somehow despite there not being a form element, more of a theory
[21:47:27] <GoSox> ok replacing the two top 'buttons' with DIVs does prevent the problem from happening
[21:47:44] <jphase> rather weird issue :\
[21:47:47] <GoSox> or even better, spans
[21:48:40] <frank_o> daniel3: could you set up a reduced / live testcase?
[21:49:17] <daniel3> frank_o, What do you mean?
[21:51:45] <frank_o> daniel3: a reduced test case is an isolated example that demonstrates the bug or issue. it contains the bare minimum html, css, and javascript required to demonstrate the bug. no extra functionality or styling.
[21:51:57] <frank_o> daniel3: see http://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ on why they "are the absolute, ... number one way to troubleshoot bugs."
[21:52:25] <daniel3> frank_o, I understand.  Might be a bit difficult to do but Ill try.
[21:53:30] <frank_o> daniel3: usually by doing that you'll discover the answer on your own before even getting back to the channel :D
[21:54:53] <daniel3> frank_o, The thing that makes no sense (okay makes some sense) was that it didn't stop working until upgrading jQuery.  It may just need to be rewritten.
[21:55:24] <frank_o> yep
[21:55:30] <frank_o> daniel3: aren't you getting any deprecation warnings in the console?
[21:55:30] <jphase> seems like that could be done entirely with css too daniel3
[21:56:41] <daniel3> frank_o, Good call.  I don't even know why I didnt even think to look there "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'msie' of undefined "
[21:58:16] <daniel3> OH, I need the jquery migrate plugin!
[21:58:31] <joroci> well
[21:59:43] <frank_o> daniel3: word :)
[22:00:07] <daniel3> That totally fixed it.  See, thanks for pushing me in the direction I needed :)
[22:00:53] <frank_o> anytime man anytime
[22:01:29] <daniel3> Its funny cause I work for a web hosting company troubleshooting websites all day, so when I get home, I get really tired troubleshooting my own sites lol.
[22:01:48] <dex5> how do i override $.ajaxTransport() for particular forms where class = x?
[22:02:36] <frank_o> daniel3: hehe yeah i know what you mean. not much juice left at the end of the day..
[22:15:37] <joroci> daniel3 what about development
[22:15:38] <joroci> ?
[22:16:27] <daniel3> joroci, huh?
[22:23:38] <joroci> troubleshooting websites all day
[22:23:45] <joroci> so
[22:24:03] <daniel3> I don't do any development at work, not web development that is.
[22:24:10] <daniel3> I do scripting, but thats mainly for shell.
[22:24:30] <joroci> what about development
[22:24:30] <joroci> ?
[22:25:52] <daniel3> I am still not following the question...
[22:28:38] <frank_o> too much eggnog
[22:30:40] <daniel3> frank_o, Maybe so.  This site was originally designed in 2006, and redesigned in 2010.  That code is from 2010 lol.
[22:31:00] <daniel3> I abandoned the project for awhile but some friends talked me into reviving it.
[22:43:20] <ekkis> evening everyone
[22:43:40] <ekkis> I want to $.get("bitcoin://.?") but it fails
[22:43:47] <ekkis> it doesn't like the protocol I guess
[22:43:58] <ekkis> how is this done?
[23:02:17] <Cache_Money> When I'm tryping in an input field the border of the input is highlighted.  Is my browser handling that?  Can I highlight an input field if I find an error while validating?
