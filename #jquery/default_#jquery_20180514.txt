[04:15:34] <tilerendering> hey ppl
[04:16:22] <tilerendering> would a jquery widget for messaging (fb style, a conversation list, and a threadview in which the conversation is presented like a chat) which you only feed with an array of messages formatted in a certain way be of use for you?
[04:16:33] <tilerendering> or does anything like that already exist?
[04:31:06] <AdamPDotty> google adwords use the same basic principle
[04:59:59] <[E]sc> i have a script that updates the input button's attributes (id, name, value), but on the second click I want to update a second change to the class. is that possible?
[05:01:00] <Cork> [E]sc: sure you just have to have a state and an if case in the click handler
[05:01:26] <Cork> [E]sc: depending on how you bound the handler and how many element it works on you either store it in a variable or in .data()
[05:06:10] <[E]sc> Cork, thank you for your reply.  I can't seem to get it to work.  the first click handler will change the attributes accordingly.  but the second click handler does not do anything. i've used the id to fire the event but no luck after the first change. any way to fix this?
[05:06:29] <Cork> [E]sc: not two handlers you do it in the same handler
[05:09:21] <[E]sc> Cork, thank you kindly. that works splendidly.
[05:21:55] <Dro> Hello, every javascript action go twice in my site
[05:22:02] <Dro> not sure why
[05:22:08] <Dro> why this may happen ?
[05:22:46] <Woet> Dro: what is your jQuery question?
[05:22:52] <Cork> most likely cause they are executed twice or bound twice
[05:23:00] <Woet> Dro: and how are we supposed to help without a link or code?
[05:23:05] <Cork> but you need to show an example for us to explain why
[05:23:09] <Dro> Cork: each action is called once
[05:23:17] <Cork> show it
[05:23:35] <Dro> Cork: a huge code and much twig .. etc
[05:23:41] <Cork> make an example
[05:23:49] <Cork> reproduce the problem in a jsfiddle
[05:23:52] <Dro> Just asking to see if someone had a smilar problem
[05:23:54] <Woet> huge code.. much twig
[05:23:57] <Woet> didnt know we spoke in doge
[05:24:06] <Cork> it will either make it possible for us to tell you why, or you will find it yourself
[05:24:29] <Dro> Cork: ok i'll copy it in jsfiddle, thanks
[05:24:59] <Cork> (but don't just dump a lot of code there, make sure the problem is reproducible)
[05:29:28] <Dro> Cork: its ok, I think I found the problem
[05:29:42] <Cork> :)
[05:29:43] <Woet> Dro: that was quick. did you not try to debug this before asking here?
[05:29:51] <Dro> I just viewed the source of code in browser, and for some reason the JS code is duplicated
[05:29:56] * Woet blinks
[05:29:58] <Dro> trying to find out why this happening
[05:30:22] <Dro> Woet: why you're too cool? :D
[05:30:23] <Cork> ya, always look at what the browser gets
[05:30:38] <Woet> Dro: well, you'd think looking at the source would be step 1
[05:30:39] <Cork> not what you edit as it actually doesn't matter
[05:31:06] <Cork> Woet: if the source code generates code it actually isn't what you should look at
[05:31:16] <Woet> Cork: source as in web page source
[05:31:20] <Woet> Cork: not backend code
[05:31:27] <Cork> ok
[05:31:29] <Cork> then ya
[05:31:37] <Woet> i guess they're ambiguous
[05:31:39] <Dro> Woet: I didn't think the browser source will be differant of my code :)
[05:31:46] <Dro> thats why I didn't viewed the source
[05:31:51] <Woet> Dro: if you use twig, it always will be.
[05:32:08] <Woet> Dro: pretty much if you use anything besides file.html, it'll be different.
[05:38:17] <Dro> Woet: thanks for the information
[05:38:34] <Dro> Trying to find out why twig is duplicated my javascripts block :/
[05:52:57] <Dro> cannot find out why my js block is duplicated :(
[05:54:56] <Cork> Dro: tried something like https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28619062/tag-use-of-twig-templating-system-duplicate-content ?
[06:02:01] <Dro> Cork: solved it :P in fact I used a block inside another block I had to close the first block before js block, thats all
[06:02:05] <Dro> thanks for your help!
[06:02:15] <Dro> Woet: thank you too! :)
[06:03:38] <Cork> :)
[06:03:41] <Cork> np
[08:01:09] <tilerendering> ppl, your thoughts about this: https://pastebin.com/DhGqhURD
[09:38:09] <cpama> hi all.  is this the right way to check if the input in a text box is only numeric or "+"?
[09:38:11] <cpama> if (evt.keyCode < 48 || evt.keyCode > 57 || evt.charCode != 43)
[09:38:22] <cpama> the check for the "+" doesn't seem to be working.
[09:38:47] <Cork> cpama: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/fromCharCode
[09:39:59] <Cork> though it is generally a better idea to validate what the user entered instead of preventing entering anything else (especially as that won't catch paste)
[09:41:01] * AdamPDotty doesnt like that '+' is "less" than '-'
[09:42:30] <cpama> +1 Cork
[09:42:34] <cpama> that's a good comment
[09:57:50] <cpama> Cork, what's the best event then to use to check AFTER the text box is populated?
[09:57:54] <cpama> focusout?
[09:58:17] <Cork> to be frank :) submit of the form
[09:58:35] <cpama> hm.  i have some other "number" fields (html 5) on the form.
[09:58:48] <cpama> and i noticed that when you leave the text box, it wipes out any alpha chars
[09:58:49] <Cork> so validate them all at the same time
[09:59:07] <Cork> that depends on the browser though
[09:59:13] <Cork> and not all browsers does the same thing
[09:59:17] <cpama> i'll be doing another validation on form submission just to be sure.
[09:59:33] <cpama> but i'm thinking i'd like to recreate similar behavior to the html5 number fields
[09:59:40] <Cork> the change event is quite good too
[09:59:41] <cpama> just so the users have the same experience across the form.
[09:59:55] <cpama> ok.  will check out change evnet
[09:59:56] <cpama> thanks
[09:59:56] <Cork> better then focus cause then it only runs if the field has been changed
[10:00:03] <cpama> gotcha
[10:18:44] <vish93> Hey guys could someone help me see why my owlcarousel slider is far too big in height. https://codepen.io/vishpatel93/full/VxQqXx/
[10:18:48] <codecutter> how do i get this work (invalid date)? moment.utc("14-05-2018 13:56:48").format('DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm:ss')
[10:20:29] <codecutter> this works moment.utc("05-14-2018 13:56:48");
[10:20:39] <codecutter> i need the day to be first
[10:20:46] <codecutter> moment.js
[10:20:49] <codecutter> lib
[10:20:58] <Cork> hmm, no
[10:21:20] <Cork> iso8601 is supported in moment so that isn't correct
[10:21:44] <codecutter> what do you mean?
[10:22:01] <Cork> iso8601 is yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
[10:22:09] <Cork> among a few other formats
[10:22:30] <codecutter> do you mean i can only use the one(s) you mentioned?
[10:22:39] <Cork> no
[10:22:46] <Cork> the supported ones are listed in the docs
[10:22:55] <Cork> but all of iso8601 are supported
[10:23:34] <codecutter> is the iso8601? moment.utc("14-05-2018 13:56:48");
[10:23:41] <Cork> no
[10:23:46] <Cork> that is the older us only format
[10:24:05] <Cork> rfc 2822
[10:24:22] <codecutter> therefore i cannot use it?
[10:25:08] <Cork> ah didn't even notice you used a none standard date order
[10:25:31] <Cork> ya, dd-mm-yyyy isn't in iso8601 as far as i know
[10:25:42] <Cork> only yyyy-mm-dd and mm-dd-yyyy
[10:26:00] <codecutter> ok, thanks
[10:26:03] <Cork> (well the later is in the rfc)
[10:27:46] <hollusion> can you recommend a file upload plugin?
[10:27:51] <hollusion> with progress bars
[10:32:38] <Cork> why do you need one?
[10:36:28] <hollusion> youre right
[10:36:52] <Cork> heh? it was a honest question :)
[10:37:36] <Cork> there are a few cases where it might make sense, but normally it is just using new FormData instead of $().serialize()
[10:39:09] <hollusion> ive found a stack overflow thread explaining how to do it
[10:39:14] <hollusion> even with progress bar
[10:39:18] <hollusion> without the need for a plugin
[10:39:49] <Cork> you only need the partial solution if you plan to get quite big files uploaded
[10:40:47] <ddought> on jquery 1.11.1, I am running into a problem where the Content-Length is intermittently set to 0 during an $.ajax call.  In debugging, I am seeing data being passed into the function call properly.  I am not setting the header manually. I am not extending jquery.  I've searched the closed/known bugs.  Anyone run into this before/may be able to pro
[10:40:47] <ddought> vide help?
[10:41:39] <Cork> ddought: is this json? html? cors?
[10:41:46] <Cork> jsonp?
[10:41:52] <Cork> your leaving out a lot of data
[10:42:30] <ddought> Let me collect some more data, I'm sorry for the insufficient description.  I will be right back.
[10:54:36] <ddought> It has dataType of 'json', with data set to a valid json (in string format--from the JSON.stringify function).  The url for the call is valid--I am getting a server response.  The requestType is 'POST'.  A beforeSend parameter is set to a function which sets Cache-Control, Pragma, Expires, and an Auth/Bearer token header.  The contentType is set to
[10:54:37] <ddought>  'application/json; charset=utf-8'.  processData is set to true.
[10:55:29] <Cork> that doesn't really help much...
[10:55:46] <Cork> can you reproduce this with the jsfiddles /echo/json service?
[11:00:26] <ddought> I won't be able to do that -- way to much to simulate/create a harness to get it to run on jsfiddle.  The most characteristic problem of the issue:  I can successfully reproduce the issue by waiting 60 seconds before triggering the ajax call.  If I trigger within that time window (< ~60seconds), the call is successful.  If I trigger the ajax call a
[11:00:27] <ddought> fter a failure (where Content-Length = 0), the call is successful.  If I wait ~60 seconds after a failure to trigger the ajax call, it fails again.  I've searched for timeouts/intervals which may be causing a problem: none there.
[11:00:32] <ddought> too*
[12:24:25] <ddought> I've narrowed the issue to the browser
[12:26:18] <robertmaxrees> which browser?
[12:30:48] <robertmaxrees> #welp
[12:48:45] <abcabc_> hi. i'm new to jquery. there is no support for now for ranges and editable p/span/div. is any coming?
[12:49:04] <robertmaxrees> abcabc_ could you clarify what you're talking about?
[12:52:02] <abcabc_> $("#someid").isEditable = true; fails to work, no errors etc
[12:52:27] <robertmaxrees> that should error - you can'
[12:52:43] <robertmaxrees> *you can't generally access properties on DOM nodes that way - you want to use .prop() for that instead.
[12:54:45] <ddought> IE (edge and 10 so far), Chrome works fine
[12:55:03] <robertmaxrees> ddought ah - what are the caching headers from the server?
[12:57:07] <robertmaxrees> abcabc_ that make sense?
[12:57:18] <ddought> Cache-Control : no-cache, Pragma: no-cache, Expires: -1,
[12:58:58] <ddought> whoops--didn't mean to leave, please let me know if I missed anything
[12:59:10] <robertmaxrees> ddought are you doing a POST or a GET?
[12:59:32] <ddought>  a PUT, actually.
[13:00:17] <robertmaxrees> are you doing any kind of http auth as apart of the request?
[13:01:21] <ddought> I wish -- I was able to pull an IE article about that.  Unfortunately, I am just passing tokens in the headers for auth.
[13:01:30] <robertmaxrees> https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ieinternals/2010/11/21/challenge-response-authentication-and-zero-length-posts/
[13:01:36] <robertmaxrees> i might check this to see if it's relevant.
[13:01:43] <ddought> Yup, that's the article I saw.
[13:02:19] <ddought> Yeah, that's about as far down the line as I could get on it -- read through the comments, too.
[13:02:48] <ddought> I appreciate the help, though.
[13:10:05] <robertmaxrees> i would triple check those headers coming from the server at that point.
[13:10:21] <robertmaxrees> also guessing you saw https://stackoverflow.com/a/18835354/923919
[13:12:55] <ddought> you are right -- that's where I got the MS link from.  if the problem was every time, it would make sense -- the fact that it is only after 1 minute is driving me mad.  I think the comments in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49403936/why-does-ie-11-browser-randomly-have-content-length-0-for-jquery-ajax-post-reque might be leading me in the righ
[13:12:56] <ddought> t direction
[13:36:31] <ddought> I've been able to find some information about IE bugging out after a keep-alive expires, I'll be testing that and reporting back
[13:38:18] <ddought> (specific to sites served over https)
[14:07:19] <ddought> ...as soon as support gets back....
[14:07:39] <robertmaxrees> what's u[?
[14:07:41] <robertmaxrees> *up
[14:17:38] <ddought> Oh, I said I would be testing and reporting back, but I am still waiting on the support side of the house to get back to their desk so we can log into the customer's test server
[14:18:30] <robertmaxrees> ah
[15:30:09] <ddought> Tried extending the keep-alives at the IIS level, then in the webconfigs for the application -- same issue with IE.  It happened in Edge, 10, 9.  Checked security settings -- nothing glaring there.
[16:28:42] <gambl0re> would it be better to use a service like firebase or just try to setup my own backend?
[16:28:50] <robertmaxrees> depends
[16:29:13] <gambl0re> hey robert, hows going?
[16:29:20] <gambl0re> depends on what?
[16:29:26] <robertmaxrees> what are you building?
[16:29:33] <robertmaxrees> do you want to worry about the backend?
[16:29:41] <gambl0re> not sure..
[16:29:53] <gambl0re> i want to focus on the front end but im gonna need a backend
[16:29:55] <robertmaxrees> the thing you're building will dictate choices like that.
[16:30:04] <gambl0re> but im not that good with backend. i only the basics
[16:30:21] <robertmaxrees> do you just need a simple static site?
[16:30:32] <gambl0re> no
[16:30:34] <robertmaxrees> or do you need to interface with a DB and stuff?
[16:30:35] <gambl0re> its gonna have users
[16:30:45] <gambl0re> yea i want to connect to a db
[16:30:53] <robertmaxrees> so what are you building?
[16:31:05] <gambl0re> events site
[16:31:44] <robertmaxrees> i mean, if you wanna minimize the amount of backend work, a service like heroku can be nice
[16:32:01] <gambl0re> heroku is for hosting
[16:32:03] <robertmaxrees> you'll still have to write a backend, but you won't have to do the same amound of configuration and whatnot.
[16:32:17] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:32:28] <robertmaxrees> how else are you expecting to make your site available to people?
[16:33:04] <gambl0re> not worrying about hosting right now. i just want to focus on building
[16:33:06] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to build an app or a site?
[16:33:20] <gambl0re> website
[16:33:23] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[16:33:33] <robertmaxrees> you realize that your backend choice will dictate hosting, right?
[16:34:49] <gambl0re> you still mad at me/
[16:34:49] <gambl0re> ?
[16:34:54] <gambl0re> from before i mean
[16:34:58] <robertmaxrees> offtopic my dude.
[16:35:00] <robertmaxrees> anyway
[16:35:17] <robertmaxrees> i think maybe you're a little confused about what firebase/heroku/et al provide.
[16:35:17] <gambl0re> i want to create a website with backend
[16:35:29] <gambl0re> what do you mean? i know what firebase is
[16:35:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[16:35:54] <robertmaxrees> what do you think firebase is?
[16:36:22] <gambl0re> baas
[16:36:33] <robertmaxrees> it also provides hosting
[16:36:45] <robertmaxrees> but you'll still have to create a basic backend on your own.
[16:37:35] <robertmaxrees> i would focus instead on figuring out what that backend needs to be.
[16:38:45] <robertmaxrees> gambl0re we can talk about it here.
[16:38:46] <robertmaxrees> :)
[16:39:03] <gambl0re> ok no worries....
[16:39:07] <gambl0re> thanks
[16:39:50] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:40:45] <gambl0re> so you advise using backend myself
[16:40:50] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[16:40:56] <robertmaxrees> you'll have to write your own backend regardless.
[16:41:06] <robertmaxrees> i'm confused about what alternatives you think you have.
[16:41:29] <gambl0re> like firebase
[16:41:33] <gambl0re> or other bass
[16:41:57] <robertmaxrees> you understand that firebase won't magically have everything done for you, right?
[16:42:02] <robertmaxrees> you'll still have to write some backend.
[16:42:29] <gambl0re> yea but obviously not as much work
[16:42:35] <robertmaxrees> right
[16:42:40] <robertmaxrees> heroku offers some similar options.
[16:42:50] <robertmaxrees> but you WILL have to provide some of your own backend.
[16:43:37] <gambl0re> do you know any node/express, react, mysql, mongo?
[16:43:46] <robertmaxrees> i've worked with all of those, yes.
[16:43:55] <gambl0re> awesome
[16:44:00] <robertmaxrees> ?
[16:44:17] <robertmaxrees> there's a #mongodb
[16:44:19] <gambl0re> im thinking of using that as my tech stack. what do you think?
[16:44:36] <robertmaxrees> i don't know nearly enough about what you're building to say one way or another.
[16:44:47] <gambl0re> no worries
[18:10:34] <gambl0re> hello?
[18:10:45] <taplar> evening
[18:11:09] <gambl0re> wheres robert?
[18:11:20] <taplar> no idea
[18:14:18] <taplar> you got a jQuery question?
[18:16:10] <gambl0re> can you recommend an alternative to bootstrap/foundation?
[18:17:14] <taplar> for page layout?
[18:20:05] <Gh0st_Preacher> (shrug)
[18:20:10] <robertmaxrees> woops
[18:20:35] <gambl0re> wtf. you said he was gone.
[18:20:42] <robertmaxrees> no he didn't.
[18:20:45] <taplar> i'm not used to that nickname
[18:20:53] <robertmaxrees> he said "no idea"
[18:20:57] <robertmaxrees> pretty different.
[18:20:59] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[18:21:19] <gambl0re> i know you guys trying to play some games with me. whatever
[18:21:35] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:21:49] <taplar> i'm being serious.  i'm used to spotting robert or duch.  i don't typically look for his other aliases or remember them
[18:21:49] <robertmaxrees> i was away for a while.
[18:22:25] <taplar> my head only has so much ram available
[18:22:41] <robertmaxrees> been such a stupid busy day.
[18:23:51] <taplar> but about the bootstrap/foundation question.  i don't really have a preference.  i usually only use bootstrap for layout in my work environment, or otherwise we roll our own.
[18:24:23] <taplar> side projects, I pretty much always roll my own
[18:26:00] <gambl0re> i dont even care anymore.
[18:26:47] <taplar> ok
[18:26:48] <robertmaxrees> wut
[18:27:27] <robertmaxrees> lol
[18:27:28] <robertmaxrees> welp
[18:28:08] <taplar> @robert  dealing with prod issues?
[18:28:18] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[18:28:25] <taplar> you mentioned being super busy
[18:28:32] <robertmaxrees> oh. just lots of meetings lately.
[18:28:38] <robertmaxrees> dat tech lead life and all.
[18:28:44] <taplar> ah
[18:28:59] <robertmaxrees> plus i'm rolling out something I've been working on since last september or so.
[18:30:03] <robertmaxrees> lots of small issues here and there.  kind of a big deal when you're replacing all of your search with a new service :)
[18:30:14] <taplar> very nice
[18:30:55] <robertmaxrees> yeah.  been a crazy few weeks.
[19:53:01] <SideFX> https://jsfiddle.net/qefamskr/
[19:53:28] <SideFX> I'm trying to take that code that currently changes the image after a new image is selected for upload and make it change the background of a div with the new image
[19:53:39] <SideFX> The commented out line is the new one I'm trying to change
[19:57:18] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[19:57:30] <robertmaxrees> does the previous line work?  for $('#prvw_img') ?
[19:57:41] <SideFX> Yeah
[19:57:55] <robertmaxrees> okay - so where are you stuck?
[19:57:57] <robertmaxrees> :)
[19:58:42] <SideFX> That's a <img> so it's changing the src, but I'm trying to change <div style="background:newimagename.jpg">
[19:59:02] <robertmaxrees> ah - so you're asking how to change the background css property?
[19:59:06] <SideFX> Yeah
[19:59:14] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/css/ :)
[19:59:39] <SideFX> I did the traditional way but it looks like it's looking for a url to fill in and the prvs_img.. result is the actual image
[20:00:00] <robertmaxrees> "result is the actual image" as in a data uri?
[20:00:14] <SideFX> As in data
[20:00:29] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[20:00:51] <robertmaxrees> starts with data:image/gif;base64, ?
[20:01:01] <robertmaxrees> or gif for jpg or w/e format?
[20:01:21] <SideFX> This ist he result of console log data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/4AAQSkZJRgABAQAAA
[20:01:27] <robertmaxrees> yeah - that's a data URI
[20:01:28] <SideFX> Wuith a lot more chars after that
[20:02:05] <robertmaxrees> you gotta do .css('background', 'url(' + dataURIHere + ')')
[20:02:30] <robertmaxrees> to tell the CSS it's a data URI
[20:02:34] <robertmaxrees> *css engine
[20:02:44] <SideFX> Let me give that a try
[20:04:38] <SideFX> I did this but not getting a result: $('#imagecontainer').css('background', 'url(' + e.target.result + ')');
[20:04:59] <SideFX> Let me check something
[20:05:19] <robertmaxrees> i might try background-image
[20:05:55] <SideFX> Ok I got it
[20:06:02] <robertmaxrees> rad :)
[20:06:30] <SideFX> Thanks, I couldn't find anything about putting data uri as a background
