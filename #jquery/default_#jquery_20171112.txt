[10:30:20] <Woet> tona: did you check the console?

[10:53:07] <Woet> tona: maybe checking the console would help
[10:53:21] <Woet> tona: perhaps it has something to do with "ReferenceError: Can't find variable: $"
[10:53:25] <Woet> tona: maybe you should load jquery if you want to use jquery

[11:27:07] <Woet> tona: what is $(window).load supposed to do?
[11:27:32] <Woet> tona: that's been deprecated since jQuery 1.8
[11:28:09] <Woet> tona: why dont you add some debug info to see whether the code actually gets executed or not?
[13:50:26] <jeremies> what is the purpose of _data in http://lpaste.net/360004 ?
[13:57:25] <pavonia> IIRC, it's a hack to get the internal data of a jQuery object to access the registered event handlers or so
[14:02:27] <sine0> hey folks I have this bit of code to resize the nav div when scrolling : if ($(document).scrollTop() > 50) {
[14:02:49] <sine0> however I dont want it to work when in mobile mode, so how do I condition it like a media query ?
[14:15:31] <sine0> wow that was easy
[14:23:24] <jeremies> I have the code in  http://lpaste.net/360004  in many places repeated can I simplifiy it in some way?
[14:23:55] <Woet> i dont know, can you?
[15:31:48] <codecutter> i'm appending a popup box as a parent() (2 levels up) when i  hover over a link, i'm using 'mouseleave' to remove popup once the cursor is no longer on hovered text. I need the box to be visible if the mouse is moved onto the popup (popup appears just below the hovered text)
[15:32:29] <codecutter> is this possible?
[16:36:36] <nopea> Is it not possible to run have jQuery scripts in the middle of a page?
[16:42:26] <fas3r> Hello,
[16:55:06] <fas3r> I have 2 nav-tabs in the same page, however, I notice that the class "active" added in the <li> is removed from the first nav-tab when clicking on the second nav-tab. if someone have an idea, thanks by advance.
[18:19:11] <tona> how could i scroll bottom automatically in one object element
[18:37:34] <madprops> For some reason when I .append elements that were cloned with clone(true, true), and then remove them, and then append them again, they lose the click listeners
[18:37:59] <madprops> like, i remove/append, they work, remove/append again, they don't work anymore
[18:39:49] <madprops> I remove them by simply setting the .html of the container to somethign else
[20:34:59] <alive876> how do i find the next  '.select-block   input[type=text]' relative to the current element? thanks
[20:54:41] <alive876> is this the right syntax for finding the next one of these?(.select-block   input[type=text]).nextSibling()
[21:00:51] <alive876> let me explain my question differently, when i put '.select-block   input[type=text]' in the element finder box in devtools , it finds three of these, how do i go to the second one?
