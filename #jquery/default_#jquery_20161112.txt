[04:11:20] <plg> Hello
[04:11:26] <plg> Please help me
[04:12:33] <plg> How can i set authorization header in all urls after successful authentication?
[05:16:32] <plg> is there any one here?
[06:37:02] <jack> Hi ,How can i set global request header for all requests?
[06:37:07] <jack> My code is https://gist.github.com/anonymous/750b021ae645fb9bdcf76db1e69f7b28
[06:37:23] <jack> Above not working
[06:52:28] <hd1> why isn't my mouseover being triggered?
[06:53:43] <jack> Hi ,How can i set global request header for all requests?
[06:53:45] <jack> My code is https://gist.github.com/anonymous/750b021ae645fb9bdcf76db1e69f7b28
[06:53:48] <jack> Above not working
[06:56:07] <hd1> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/457f6becc483a0e6e4748af2d753615d
[06:58:53] <sillyslux> jack this give me "Authorization: Bearer null" in Request Headers
[06:59:25] <jack> Yes
[06:59:47] <sillyslux> so it is working
[07:00:47] <sillyslux> do you redefine $? i.e. load another jquery.js after your code has been processed, at page end?
[07:00:52] <hd1> sillyslux: my guess is that jack wants to have the Bearer be something aside from "null"
[07:00:53] <jack> sillyslux : Thanks for reply but it is not set token in place of null for all requests
[07:01:31] <sillyslux> null is my localStorage.token
[07:02:03] <jack> sillyslux : Can i give all code ?
[07:03:03] <sillyslux> now it's Authorization:Bearer chrr
[07:03:13] <sillyslux> jack, sure
[07:03:38] <jack> sillyslux : will it work in all requests?
[07:03:57] <jack> It is not working in my project
[07:05:21] <sillyslux> well then there's something wrong in your project
[07:05:26] <jack> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/28c70cb3e5abf4f8dfa7186b05c74289
[07:05:34] <jack> Please check code
[07:05:46] <jack> What is wrong in that?
[07:05:50] <sillyslux> hd1 wrap your code like jack did in line 1
[07:07:49] <sillyslux> did you assemble this from snippets or is it all in your file exactly like in that gist?
[07:08:28] <jack> exactly but some changes in ajaxsetup jquery
[07:09:55] <sillyslux> well, then i suggest you move the ajax setup part up to before your ajax requests are fired
[07:10:26] <sillyslux> you can try in your console jQuery.ajax('test').then(e=>console.log(e))
[07:10:43] <sillyslux> and check network panel to examine the request now
[07:10:53] <sillyslux> before you make the changes
[07:11:01] <sillyslux> it should have worked already
[07:12:17] <jack> sillyslux: Again thanks for reply but one query where should i put "jQuery.ajax('test').then(e=>console.log(e)) "?
[07:12:30] <sillyslux> in your js console
[07:12:40] <sillyslux> it'll fire one ajax request
[07:13:15] <sillyslux> then look in network panel for test, click it and have a look at your request headers
[07:13:29] <sillyslux> (scroll down)
[07:13:58] <hd1> err... you want my javascript in between <script> tags, sillyslux?
[07:14:03] <jack> Ok..I check
[07:14:41] <hd1> even though it is an external JS file?
[07:15:18] <sillyslux> hd1 you assign the eventlistener to all p elements
[07:15:43] <sillyslux> this happens at a moment when there are not any elements available anywhere
[07:15:51] <sillyslux> you have to wait for document.ready
[07:16:06] <sillyslux> $() does just that
[07:16:06] <hd1> thanks, sillyslux, let me try that
[07:17:46] <sillyslux> hd1 the other stuff in already in `$(document).ready(function(){` (which is the same as $(), you can add your stuff there if you want)
[07:18:42] <jack> sillyslux: I tested it set header but one query: Wll it work for all requests to all uris
[07:18:50] <sillyslux> oh no, forget that last part hd1
[07:18:59] <sillyslux> was looking at wrong gisz
[07:20:54] <sillyslux> jack i'm not sure, if your request is on another domain, it probably should not send the token, but why don't you try it yourself?
[07:21:00] <sillyslux> and tell me afterwards?
[07:22:39] <jack> sillyslux:it is one same domain right now.I want to set authorization header in all uri requests to be done in one application hosted on single domain
[07:22:42] <sillyslux> nope, sends the token only to same origin
[07:23:12] <jack> yes
[07:24:08] <sillyslux> also only if http(s) matches
[07:24:39] <hd1> .mouseover still isn't being triggered
[07:24:42] <jack> I use https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth/ packege
[07:24:57] <jack> https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth/wiki/Authentication
[07:25:07] <sillyslux> hd1 open your js console, paste your code and see if that helps
[07:25:39] <hd1> sillyslux: that's what I did
[07:25:58] <hd1> that works fine, it just isn't triggered on the page
[07:29:25] <sillyslux> add a `console.log('elements found', $('p'));` before your code
[07:29:40] <sillyslux> reload and tell how many
[07:29:55] <jack> sillyslux: How can i set ajaxsetup header just after just after user authentication ?
[07:30:47] <sillyslux> you could make it easy and do `headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + localStorage.getItem('token') }`
[07:31:14] <sillyslux> then it'll always be looked up
[07:31:21] <jack> ok
[07:31:28] <jack> Just trying
[07:38:27] <jack> sillyslux: I tried but still dashboard page do not have authorization header
[07:39:06] <jack> login page called before test page
[07:40:51] <sillyslux> well... then there's something wrong in your project
[07:41:43] <sillyslux> dashboard page.. is that the initial page load?
[07:42:25] <sillyslux> or just another ajax request being executed before you run ajaxsetup?
[07:44:05] <jack> dashboard page is initial page with loginform
[07:44:49] <jack> after successful authentication it is redirected to http://zenvus.flyteksun.com/dashboard/login
[07:45:06] <sillyslux> well then... i've never done anything that requires login/authentication myself
[07:45:35] <sillyslux> but from what i heard, you could use cookies and securecookies for that
[07:46:22] <jack> Just open  http://zenvus.flyteksun.com/dashboard
[07:46:49] <jack> User username/password : farmer1@email.com/farmer1231
[07:48:00] <sillyslux> brb
[07:48:22] <jack> sillyslux : just test .It is demo account
[07:49:44] <jack> sillyslux: Please test
[07:51:08] <sillyslux> yep
[07:51:47] <sillyslux> is that symfony?
[07:53:27] <sillyslux> ah now i'm in
[07:53:32] <sillyslux> first i got 500
[07:53:36] <jack> laravel
[07:53:44] <jack> Just check ahgain
[07:54:06] <jack> one mistake was there
[07:56:06] <jack> sillyslux: Done sir ?
[07:56:18] <sillyslux> so, with jquery you can add headers to ajax requests, i don't know what to do if you need special headers outside js
[07:57:15] <jack> I want to add authorization header in each request of different uri
[07:58:34] <sillyslux> i might be wrong, but i don't think js helps you with that
[07:58:42] <sillyslux> use cookies
[07:58:44] <sillyslux> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13729749/how-does-cookie-secure-flag-work
[07:59:05] <sillyslux> or better yet, ask again in ##javascript
[08:00:50] <sillyslux> i'm looking at jwt-auth just now
[08:04:16] <sillyslux> puhh, see i don't know authentication with php
[08:04:30] <sillyslux> does it work outside jwt-auth?
[08:04:56] <sillyslux> in your project, once the user is logged in and navigates between pages
[08:05:47] <sillyslux> laravel has his session, he's authenticated, is that all working?
[08:09:36] <sillyslux> what i see now is a laravel_session cookie with the token, that seems right
[08:10:19] <sillyslux> also for ajax requests the authorization header is set with the same token, so that should work now?
[08:23:28] <jack> sillyslux: laravel session not working
[08:25:31] <sillyslux> you need that for authentication when navigating outside js (i.e. not ajax requests, but regular browsing)
[08:26:32] <sillyslux> i guess laravel has that covered in their docs
[08:27:33] <sillyslux> ...with the default Eloquent authentication driver. If your application is not using Eloquent, you may use the database authentication driver which uses the Laravel query builder.
[08:27:59] <sillyslux> i haven't done php in yrs :(
[08:28:55] <sillyslux> $user = Auth::user();
[08:29:02] <sillyslux> do you have that somewhere?
[08:29:50] <sillyslux> there's lots and lots documentation on that
[10:06:04] <mike_papa> $('.myClass').each(myCallback) - in this code, callback gets index, and object. How can I pass additional arguments?
[10:06:10] <WillPittenger> I have a GreaseMonkey script which appears to be getting a value for |$| that isn't jQuery.  |jQuery| isn't a known variable in the Firefox/Pale Moon debugger console.  I have the require line |// @require     https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js| inserted.  But the jQuery is coming from somewhere else.  There are no other scripts running.  What's going on?
[10:07:56] <mike_papa> I want callback to be called like: myCallback(index, object, myArgument), or myCallback(index, object, {myArgument: value}).
[10:09:42] <WillPittenger> mike_papa: You could pass a wrapper function.  |each(function() {index, object, argts) {myCallback(index, object, args);});
[10:11:54] <mike_papa> WillPittenger: Thanks. I didn't think about wrapping it.
[10:18:09] <funkt> https://jsfiddle.net/0t1n576p/1 - Hi there I am trying to append an li to a nested list and  would like to target the text if contains a certain link name. I cannot seem to get it to connect to my first li in the nested list anyone have any ideas?
[10:20:07] <funkt> I have tried so many different ways of trying to get this to work just cannot work out how to quite get it right I know i'm close
[10:22:43] <sillyslux> funkt, trying to insert li into li?
[10:23:32] <funkt>   Yes well trying to insert li into the ul with class sub menu depedent on the parent li having a ceratin text
[10:23:42] <funkt> in it's link
[10:24:56] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/sillyslux/0t1n576p/2/
[10:25:06] <sillyslux> that's li inti li
[10:25:08] <sillyslux> into
[10:25:25] <sillyslux> ah
[10:26:38] <funkt> Sure... What I need is to insert it into the ul > li > ul > li dependent on its parent li before the second ul containing the text in the parent li "Parent 1"
[10:26:49] <funkt> Thanks for your'e help
[10:27:32] <funkt> I have tried all sorts but cannot seem to target or get the li to go into the sub ul dependent on the parent li text#
[10:27:35] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/sillyslux/0t1n576p/3/ this?
[10:29:11] <funkt> Thank you mate!!! so much I have bent my brain backwards trying to get that and have learnt tonnes of syntax in the process!
[10:29:16] <funkt> v.kind ty
[10:29:20] <sillyslux> sure you don't want to insert <ul><li> Sub Link Created</ul>?
[10:29:55] <funkt> Got a jsfiddle for that?
[10:30:23] <sillyslux> that would be a sub-sub menu
[10:30:32] <sillyslux> you had .first() in there
[10:30:55] <sillyslux> so a sub-sub inside "Sub Link 1"?
[10:31:42] <funkt> so a ul > li > ul > li > ul [3 tier?]
[10:32:40] <sillyslux> https://jsfiddle.net/sillyslux/0t1n576p/5/
[10:32:44] <funkt> To be honest I wanted to amend a mobile menu and on click often cannot get the actual parent link as the parent link often opend the sub links therefore no prent link this would resolve the issue
[10:33:52] <sillyslux> hmm
[10:33:57] <sillyslux> i don't get it
[10:33:59] <funkt> I like that!
[10:34:01] <sillyslux> wat?
[10:34:17] <funkt> Thanks for your help!
[10:34:20] <sillyslux> :)
[12:09:34] <funkt> Hi there bit of a query https://jsfiddle.net/0r7bhm0L/16/ I have this current fiddle and what I would like to do is get the list items of each sub li that is availiable connected with it's relevant parent li
[12:09:37] <funkt> any ideas?
[12:32:28] <placidb> hi. I'm having some trouble formulating a selector query. how would I go about selecting elements of a certain class, except those that belong to a specific parent class? thank you for your time.
[12:49:09] <onca> is there a easy way to scroll to the top of the page, without using the target href='#'?
[13:05:07] <ExeciN> how do i get the text inside of a text input?
[13:10:44] <ExeciN> I tried using val() but it doesn't work
[13:12:09] <ExeciN> nevermind. my selector was wrong
[14:14:28] <ExeciN> I need a way to count how many element my selector actually selected. I skimmed through api.jquery.com and I found length() and size(). I went to try length() but I was getting a length is not a function error so I moved to the size. On size()'s page I found out that length was deprecated. Now I'm using size() but I'm getting the same error. what can I use on the latest jQuery 3 to get the number of selected elements?
[14:14:36] <ExeciN> here is my code so far: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/86a35b1118ca11e230e6225da301aeaa
[14:17:47] <snover> length is a property, not a function. just like regular arrays.
[16:16:38] <hiiii> hello
[16:17:13] <hiiii> everyone seems sleepy
[16:39:33] <inthl> i have an issue with datatables (responsive) that could be solved using jquery and its each() selector to recalc the datatables. Now how do I select all the datatables, after they have been initialized? using $('.datatable').each(function() {  $(this).responsive.recalc(); ...does not work, since this does not select the datatables objects, just the css selector
