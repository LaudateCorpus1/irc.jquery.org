[02:18:40] <anli_> I do not manage to cancel a jQuery click event, trying event.preventDefault() and event.stopPropagation();
[02:29:44] <pavonia> Show what you have tried
[02:30:19] <anli_> sorry, will do
[02:34:34] <anli_> https://pastebin.com/tJU4EQUj
[02:34:50] <anli_> Wow, that line height is fubar
[02:34:57] <anli_> :)
[02:37:46] <anli_> stopImmediatePropagation should be it, I assume
[02:46:12] <anli_> Seems like I have to listen for form submission instead
[02:46:44] <anli_> But that feels clumsy
[02:56:31] <sl33k> I have a selector statement: $(`#generateOptionsCheckbox-${NEW_QUESTION}`).prop('checked')
[02:57:33] <sl33k> How do I tweak it so that #generateMcqCheckbox.. as well as #generateMsqCheckbox.. is evaluated by that conditional?
[03:06:29] <digitalowl> Hello. I have a question about Validation plugin. Why "email" validator return true for "t@t" email address?
[03:11:12] <Cork> sl33k: you can't really
[03:11:26] <Cork> sl33k: checked is a dom state an...
[03:11:29] <Cork> correction you can
[03:12:11] <Cork> sl33k: $(`#generateOptionsCheckbox:checked, #generateMsqCheckbox:checked`).length == 2
[03:13:09] <Cork> anli_: i would quite strongly recommend against doing it that way
[03:13:33] <anli_> Then, instead, what do you recommend?
[03:13:39] <sl33k> Cork: What do you think about this? $('[id^=generate][id$=OptionsCheckbox-${NEW_QUESTION}]').prop('checked')
[03:13:41] <Cork> anli_: it is better to set a separate value and check that in the event handlers you want to ignore the event
[03:13:47] <Cork> you don't ever want to stop events
[03:13:50] <sl33k> Taken from: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5949194/wanted-jquery-selector-with-variable-part-in-the-middle
[03:13:52] <Cork> as it means you can't ever use them again
[03:14:11] <anli_> Cork: But when the user presses the button, there will be a new event
[03:14:32] <Cork> anli_: uh, what?
[03:14:59] <Cork> sl33k: it will return true if there is one element that is checked
[03:15:01] <anli_> Why would I want to use an event again?
[03:15:03] <Cork> ignoring what element it is
[03:15:07] <anli_> :)
[03:15:27] <Cork> anli_: in my case it was when i later needed to add a logout timer
[03:15:33] <anli_> ok
[03:15:39] <Cork> and did this by tracking mouse movements and keyinputs
[03:15:57] <sl33k> Cork: Only one is fine according to my requirements if I was ambiguos
[03:16:09] <Cork> when i canceled events for some cases it meant the timer reset didn't get any events when the user worked there
[03:16:12] <Cork> and meant they got logged out
[03:16:17] <anli_> Maybe its not advisable to cancel the click event as I am doing, but why is it unstoppable?
[03:16:41] <Cork> i had to throw out the entire site and write it ascratch as it was proliferated through out
[03:16:45] <anli_> ok
[03:16:57] <Cork> anli_: i have to little context
[03:17:11] <Cork> but most likely cause you want to prevent it from an event handler triggering BEFORE you
[03:17:35] <anli_> But then, the webpage would not wait for me to answer the prompt
[03:17:44] <Cork> sl33k: then $(`#generateOptionsCheckbox:checked, #generateMsqCheckbox:checked`).length
[03:18:08] <Cork> sl33k: avoid [id] as it degrades the selector from an id selector to an attribute selector and that is much sloer
[03:18:10] <Cork> *slower
[03:18:19] <Cork> anli_: it would actually
[03:18:23] <anli_> oh
[03:18:32] <anli_> I never knew it would
[03:18:38] <Cork> cause comfirm and alert is weird curly monsters
[03:18:49] <sl33k> cool thanks Cork
[03:18:59] <anli_> :)
[03:19:03] <Cork> they make the browser flip the event orders and in some times run the same code multiple times
[03:19:17] <Cork> never EVER trust what the code looks like when you use either of them
[03:19:38] <anli_> Maybe I should add a class to the button and in the form submit event, I check if the latest clicked button had that class
[03:20:20] <Cork> anli_: could you explain (or even better make a jsfiddle showing) what you are trying to do?
[03:20:42] <Cork> cause if this is for a form the solution is to use .submit on the form instead of click on the button
[03:20:51] <anli_> It also involves asp.net, but I will try the solution I came up with
[03:20:53] <Cork> as preventing the click won't prevent the form from submitting
[03:21:04] <anli_> I will not prevent the click then, but submit
[03:36:11] <anli_> oh, the form was submitted, it seems, or an internal form
[03:36:27] <anli_> the form was _never_ submitted, correction
[04:46:22] <runtyrobot> Mornin'! Quick question - if I have a multidimensional array (foo[0][bar], foo[0][morebar], foo[1][bar]) - is there a way to http encode it ?
[04:46:52] <Cork> runtyrobot: http encode?
[04:47:04] <Cork> you mean query encode it?
[04:47:18] <runtyrobot> Sorry, to be parsed with a GET request - as part of the URL
[04:47:22] <Cork> if yes, then you don't need to
[04:47:47] <Cork> http://www.example.com/?foo[0][morebar]=10
[04:48:03] <Cork> no need to encode anything
[04:48:20] <runtyrobot> so I can just append the array to the url ?
[04:48:33] <Cork> yes, though if you use ajax there is cleaner solutions
[04:48:37] <runtyrobot> I agree
[04:48:56] <runtyrobot> unfortunately - that's not an option as it is now (was handed the problem from elsewhere :|)
[04:49:30] <runtyrobot> Much appriciated - thank yoU!
[04:49:35] <Cork> runtyrobot: i meant $.ajax(url, { data: { foo: [{ morebar: 10 }] } })
[04:49:54] <Cork> it will give you the url i posted before
[04:50:15] <runtyrobot> ah!
[04:50:32] <anli_> uh, I ended up overriding __doPostback
[04:50:32] <Cork> (if url='http://www.example.com/' that is)
[04:50:52] <anli_> Not a pretty sight
[05:38:55] <sonu_nk> when i am using " $(document).find("#country-preview").on("change",function() {  alert("Its here")};  means alert is working after i am putting select options with $(document).find("#country-preview").html($(document).find('#htmlCntry').html());"  and now strange onChange event is not working
[05:41:15] <lclhst> sonu_nk: is #htmlCntry inside of #country-preview ?
[05:41:59] <sonu_nk> #country-preview has select tag and  #htmlCntry has all the options in html in hidden div..
[05:42:41] <sonu_nk> lclhst, for your que , no its #country-preview  not in #htmlCntry.
[05:44:42] <sonu_nk> https://jsfiddle.net/wndsypgw/ lclhst
[05:52:24] <pavonia> There's no HTML in there
[05:54:38] <sonu_nk> pavonia, there is html which i not posted..just i am wondering why onChange is not working.
[05:55:40] <pavonia> It's hard to tell without the corresponding HTML part
[05:56:15] <pavonia> Also, $(document).find("#country-preview") == $("#country-preview"), I think
[06:04:24] <Cork> it is
[06:04:38] <Cork> sonu_nk: you want to use event delegation
[06:05:19] <Cork> sonu_nk: $(document).on('change', '#country-preview', function() {})
[06:05:47] <Cork> hmm actually
[06:06:33] <Cork> that shouldn't matter
[06:08:04] <Cork> sonu_nk: btw, why are you leaking the htmlCountry variable outside the click handler?
[06:08:54] <Cork> ah, now i get what you're trying to do
[06:09:24] <lclhst> sonu_nk: please attach HTML code
[06:09:28] <Cork> sonu_nk: remove the .html() command when you grab the element and things should work both faster and without this problem
[06:10:13] <lclhst> Cork: maybe he's trying to set HTML of that hidden element after second click? ;d
[06:10:40] <Cork> no he has a preview that he later creates a div and attaches to
[06:10:41] <sonu_nk> Cork, i did not get which .html()you are refering..
[06:10:52] <Cork> but as he converts it to html all event handlers gets destroyed
[06:11:12] <Cork> sonu_nk: if you stop destroying the dom elements every time you move them the handlers would survive
[06:11:12] <sonu_nk> Cork, yes all event destroyed.. and best solution forthis ?
[06:12:30] <Cork> sonu_nk: i would have an extra div inside country-preview (or an extra outside doesn't matter)
[06:12:37] <Cork> then just move the div between the two places you want it
[06:12:50] <Cork> dom elements can only exist at one place at a time so it would "jump" automatically
[06:22:11] <sonu_nk> ok...
[08:01:07] <Duikb00t> hi
[08:03:47] <jan77> Duikboot: hi
[08:04:10] <Duikb00t> Omg I have a really strange error
[08:04:20] <Duikb00t> Why does this one appear: https://kopy.io/#line-21482
[08:04:36] <Duikb00t> It's my compiled JS file with all libs in it but I Can't load mixItUp it seems ....
[08:05:36] <Cork> uh, its empty
[08:06:34] <Duikb00t> .container is empty?
[08:06:38] <Duikb00t> .container_2 *
[08:06:46] <Duikb00t> Or https://kopy.io/#line-10269  ... because I imported the lib.
[08:06:47] <Cork> the link goes to an empty editor
[08:06:52] <Duikb00t> oh raelly
[08:06:54] <Duikb00t> omg
[08:07:05] <Duikb00t> merde
[08:07:47] <Cork> (the main reason why i keep pushing ppl to jsfiddle, the other ones fail badly when more then one user wants to work with it)
[08:08:17] <Duikb00t> I can work with jsFiddle but this feels like an asset issue 1 second
[08:08:28] <Cork> asset?
[08:08:35] <Cork> there is no code in it what so ever
[08:08:47] <Duikb00t> 1 second ;P
[08:09:38] <Duikb00t> As you can see 1) I load here mixitup https://gist.github.com/duikb00t/4a4310a4cf5b12d6adf2d0a25a21a6cc#file-gistfile1-js-L10269
[08:11:59] <Duikb00t> OK I setup a fiddle but it feels like that's where the issue starts .
[08:24:42] <Duikb00t> so https://jsfiddle.net/bahfgL8b/1/
[08:25:04] <Duikb00t> Which now gives me VM128 jquery.mixitup.min.js:1 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'indexOf' of undefined but I don't get that issue locally
[08:28:43] <Duikb00t> Even better: this is how I load it https://jsfiddle.net/bahfgL8b/3/
[08:28:48] <Duikb00t> And it's exact the same error I get
[08:40:53] <Duikb00t> pfff Im out of options >< What the hell
[08:41:27] <Cork> the last fiddle gives me $(...).mixItUp is not a function TypeError: $(...).mixItUp is not a function
[08:41:53] <Cork> ah, you run it in onload
[08:42:42] <Duikb00t> fixed it writing it inplain js
[08:42:45] <Duikb00t> instead of with jquery
[08:42:50] <Duikb00t> strange I don't see what I did wrong but it works now.
[08:43:02] <Duikb00t> Doing: var mixer = mixitup('.container_2', { .... }
[08:43:34] <Cork> its most likely that you gave a jquery object to mixitup and it expects a string
[08:43:47] <Cork> or something like that
[08:43:56] <Cork> hard to say without seeing a working example
[08:47:38] <Duikb00t> strange indeed yeah
[08:47:41] <Duikb00t> could be something like that.
[08:48:04] <Cork> not really strange no
[09:14:18] <traptrip> given the return value of $.serializeArray(), what would be the best (= fastest, portable, most elegant) way to pick out a value, by a given name? I can iterate over the array and check the .name for all elements and then return its corresponding value, but I'm afraid this might not be the best way performance-wise. any opinions?
[09:21:18] <lclhst> traptrip: you can use result[index][key]
[09:22:53] <shoky> traptrip: $.serializeArray().filter(function(prop) { return prop.name === '...' })[0].value
[09:49:22] <Cork> shoky: .filter??
[09:49:40] <Cork> ah, native array
[09:50:07] <Cork> traptrip: personally i usually use the serializeObject plugin
[09:50:17] <Cork> then you get an object you can just access
[09:50:26] <Cork> (and the plugin is small)
[09:51:14] <MikeD_> are the .name unique?
[09:54:38] <sonu_nk> how to print html5 code in html using jquery ? $("input[type='submit']").prop('disabled', true).val("Added &#10003;");
[09:54:42] <sonu_nk> its not working/
[09:55:10] <MikeD_> are you trying to set .text() ?
[09:55:28] <lclhst> sonu_nk: .html() instead of val()
[09:56:10] <Cork> also it's called entity not html5 code
[09:56:20] <MikeD_> yeah, .html() would treat that entity correctly while .text() would give you literal ampersand, hash, and semicolon
[09:56:28] <Cork> ya, except its for an input
[09:56:36] <Cork> so you would have to do some fiddling
[09:56:39] <sonu_nk>  .html()  not working
[09:56:53] <Cork> .val($('<div>').html("Added &#10003;").text());
[09:57:08] <Cork> or just use the raw unicode character
[09:57:16] <MikeD_> use a button instead of an input?
[09:57:32] <Cork> that is a good choice for other reasons too
[12:29:30] <printForever> I'm looking for an editor like https://babeljs.io/repl/ that would enable me to write JavaScript and have console.log's outputted in the editor itself (I'm writing just JS code).
[12:31:11] <robertmaxrees> You want an editor with a build-in repl./
[12:31:30] <printForever> as I've been told
[12:31:33] <printForever> repl
[12:31:37] <printForever> why is it named repl?
[12:31:43] <printForever> I'm using phpStorm...
[12:31:50] <robertmaxrees> Read-Eval-Print-Loop
[12:32:45] <printForever> ooooooh
[12:32:51] <printForever> thank you :D
[12:33:00] <printForever> repl for phpStrom then :)
[12:33:19] <robertmaxrees> https://blog.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/2014/07/new-live-console-in-javascript-and-node-js-debugger/
[12:33:41] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, pretty much every editor has a built-in console
[12:33:44] <printForever> thank youuuu!
[12:34:33] <printForever> I'm looking on how to install it
[12:35:22] <robertmaxrees> that's a blog post from jetbrains - you already have the console available.
[12:35:52] <printForever> I have a phpStorm license
[12:35:54] <printForever> latest update
[12:35:59] <printForever> and I can't find the console
[12:36:57] <robertmaxrees> https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/debug-tool-window-console.html
[12:37:03] <robertmaxrees> google, yo :)
[12:37:48] <printForever> oh ok
[12:37:51] <printForever> I have to run it
[12:38:02] <printForever> ah, I've found an answer on YouTube :D
[12:45:41] <printForever> robertmaxrees: unfortunately its not straight forward, and phpStorm needs debugger in order to show the console
[12:45:51] <robertmaxrees> (shrug)
[12:45:56] <robertmaxrees> I use vscode.
[12:46:10] <robertmaxrees> which has a terminal built-in
[12:46:16] <printForever> Terminal or Console?
[12:46:21] <printForever> phpStorm has Terminal
[12:46:25] <robertmaxrees> same diff ;)_
[12:46:25] <printForever> but its a Mac Terminal
[12:46:33] <printForever> no, its not
[12:46:36] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:46:42] <robertmaxrees> it's whatever your host os has
[12:46:44] <printForever> one is system shell and another is JS Debugger
[12:46:47] <robertmaxrees> *sigh*
[12:46:54] <printForever> :\
[12:47:00] <robertmaxrees> good luck :)
[12:47:13] <printForever> I have VS installed
[12:47:22] <printForever> it does not have a JS console
[12:47:36] <printForever> *Visual Code Studio
[12:56:59] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/UWEXfh5.png seems to work well enough for me.
[12:57:06] <robertmaxrees> and is visual studio code fwiw
[12:57:29] <robertmaxrees> *it's
[12:57:49] <robertmaxrees> so why do you think you need some kind of crazy repl setup?
[12:57:56] <robertmaxrees> oh they left hahaha
[13:31:15] <taplar> you failed to print forever
[13:31:31] <taplar> what a shamu
[13:31:36] <robertmaxrees> hahahaha
[15:39:55] <taplar> juuust the two of us.  makin castles in the sky
[16:37:49] <suexec_> https://pastebin.com/nndpzCVF I have a div that looks like the paste. I want the entire div to be draggable, but at the moment it can be dragged by pulling elements inside the div as well. I want only <div id="top_*"> to be possible to drag from .. is that possible ?
[16:38:49] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[16:39:18] <taplar> is that draggable attribute the html5 attribute?
[16:39:36] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/draggable
[16:39:57] <taplar> so this isn't using jQuery
[16:40:05] <robertmaxrees> "By default, only text selections, images, and links can be dragged. For all others elements, the event ondragstart must be set for the drag and drop mechanism to work"
[16:40:07] <robertmaxrees> but yeah.
[16:40:12] <robertmaxrees> suexec_ i might ask in #html
[16:40:19] <suexec_> I believe so, yes. I also attach an event listener to "dragstart" for the element
[16:41:35] <taplar> https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/dnd/basics/
[16:42:12] <taplar> i assume in dragstart you could check if it is the top element and if not, cancel it
[16:46:16] <suexec_> As far as I can tell, the dragstart returns the whole element that has draggable enabled. It doesn't tell me exactly which subelement was selected
[16:47:39] <taplar> hit up #html or ##javascript for that issue
[16:54:22] <gambl0re> hello?
[16:54:56] <taplar> evening
[16:55:16] <suexec_> Fixed it!
[16:56:00] <suexec_> taplar, robertmaxrees , for the record if you want to know what I did: I added a mouseenter/mouseleave listener to the #content <div>, where I set/unset the draggable attribute. Works like a charm!
[23:06:16] <sopparus> hello
[23:06:24] <sopparus> can I append text into a div within a div?
[23:11:50] <sopparus> got it
