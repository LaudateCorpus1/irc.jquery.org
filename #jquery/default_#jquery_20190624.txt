[07:19:14] <littlebit> hi people, I have been using jquery along with asp.net for a while now, and I have a form that has lots of elements that used to the saved via post request, now I have exceeded the limit of the queryString. I use jquery to get all the elements in the form and convert them into one big json string, the next step that I would want to do is to convert that json string into a file and then upload that file.
[07:19:48] <littlebit> now i'm new to jquery and I hope that someone can point me to the right direction of how to do that?
[07:20:25] <Cork> littlebit: hint to make it easier for ppl to answer your questions, separate the question from the backstory
[07:20:54] <Cork> but if the question is how to generate a file for upload check Blob
[07:21:05] <littlebit> Blob?
[07:21:11] <Cork> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob
[07:22:37] <littlebit> ok thx
[07:23:14] <littlebit> Cork: is that included in jquery or do i need to add another library
[07:23:24] <Cork> its part of javascript
[07:23:35] <Cork> all fairly modern browsers have it
[07:24:08] <littlebit> Cork: ok thx
[07:40:11] <littlebit> Cork: do you have an example of how it is done? I have followed the instructions on that page but I still get the message that the query string is too long
[07:40:32] <Cork> littlebit: are you using it with $.post?
[07:43:39] <littlebit> TYPE:"POST", URL:"/MY/URL",DATA: {config: blob, configID:"123"}
[07:45:16] <Cork> you can't just add it to the data object
[07:45:24] <Cork> you need to use a FileData object
[07:45:32] <littlebit> Cork: dpaste.com/36VS333
[07:45:33] <Cork> also you have to tell ajax to not parse the data value
[07:45:50] <littlebit> ok
[07:47:01] <littlebit> do you have an example?
[07:48:28] <littlebit> Cork: or do you mean FormData?
[07:48:48] <Cork> var content = new FormData(); content.append('config', blob); content.append('id', '123'); $.ajax(url, { processData: false, contentType: false, data: content });
[07:48:53] <Cork> something like that should work
[07:49:05] <Cork> and ya i said FileData but meant FormData
[07:49:17] <littlebit> Cork: was wondering that I couldn't find anything on FileData
[07:49:34] <littlebit> ok, let me try that out and get back to you
[09:06:12] <littlebit> Cork: do you have another way other than using blobs?
[09:06:34] <Cork> littlebit: not really
[09:06:51] <Cork> littlebit: also converting the json to a file doesn't change the post size
[09:06:56] <Cork> it just changes the format a little
[14:04:18] <plamb> I bound a click event to a (i think) an ajax inserted button
[14:04:32] <plamb> .trigger("click") triggers it and .click()
[14:04:37] <plamb> but not a true mouse click
[14:04:53] <robertmaxrees> how are you binding the handler?
[14:05:05] <plamb> like this
[14:05:06] <plamb> $('.field--name-field-section-sub-tabs').on("click",'.field-add-more-submit',function(){
[14:05:17] <plamb> the first class i believe is there initially
[14:05:50] <plamb> if its any help
[14:05:59] <plamb> the input is of type=submit
[14:06:01] <robertmaxrees> do you have any css on it w/r/t pointer-events?
[14:06:15] <plamb> good question im not sure
[14:06:20] <plamb> could that block jquery ?
[14:06:37] <plamb> this is the absolutely disgusting HTML
[14:06:38] <plamb> https://gist.github.com/piercelamb/8aae3eff0c264044b079b5e747f841af
[14:06:47] <robertmaxrees> it's not blocking jquery, it's blocking the mouse event.,
[14:06:52] <plamb> ah
[14:06:54] <plamb> let me check
[14:07:09] <plamb> another odd thing about this button, is that right click also triggers the button
[14:08:21] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see a test case at this point.
[14:10:50] <robertmaxrees> also: why bind to the click and not the form's submit?
[14:11:41] <plamb> this is the nutty thing about drupal
[14:12:04] <plamb> there are basically unlimited input[type=submit]'s in that form
[14:13:07] <plamb> the html that framework creates is basically devoid of meaning
[14:13:40] <robertmaxrees> do you not care about any other button being pressed?
[14:14:15] <plamb> im trying to apply that click listener to a number of buttons, all with that class
[14:14:22] <plamb> and all are input[type=submit]
[14:14:43] <robertmaxrees> i guess i'm failing to see why you can't just bind to the form's submit event :)
[14:14:52] <robertmaxrees> but either way, it's hard to troubleshoot this without having it in front of me.
[14:14:59] <plamb> yeah i hear you
[14:15:09] <plamb> and hard to create a test case because of the generated code drupal creates
[14:15:13] <plamb> ill see if i can create one
[14:43:53] <Ownix> Is there a simple jquery libray for adding rows of data in a form?
[14:44:03] <robertmaxrees> whatcha mean?
[14:44:10] <Ownix> Like having the little "+" and a new textbox appears and then a "-" to remove
[14:44:18] <Ownix> Essentially, a one-to-many
[14:44:23] <Ownix> Representation of the data
[14:44:33] <robertmaxrees> ah.  pretty easy to implement - shouldn't need an entire plugin for that.
[14:45:20] <Ownix> Gotcha
[14:45:42] <robertmaxrees> especially if you're already using a client-side templating engine.
[15:48:26] <ubbie> I need first to do a loop to get right content, then I need to do another loop with that content from the first loop. BUT I dont want to do a loop/each insida a loop/each. How to get these separate?
[15:48:47] <robertmaxrees> use a .map() for the first one.
[15:50:05] <robertmaxrees> (make a fiddle if you need more help :) )
[16:13:34] <robertmaxrees> welp
[16:18:09] <ubbie> robertmaxrees thx, will check it out
