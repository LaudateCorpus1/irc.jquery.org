[00:11:31] <vijay> @Cork Thanks!
[01:27:40] <jaggz> is it possible my $('... img').on('load',...) function might not get called?
[01:28:13] <jaggz> I'm reloading my page, and sometimes my image slider displays without the slider.. all images appear vertically
[01:37:41] <Omar-> good morning
[01:42:57] <rootie_> gut morgen omar
[01:43:31] <Omar-> rootie_ gut morgen. wie geht
[01:43:45] <rootie_> sehr gut, du
[01:44:08] <Omar-> alles ist gut.
[01:44:11] <rootie_> :)
[01:44:15] <Omar-> :)
[01:44:29] <rootie_> you have inspired me to learn german Omar
[01:44:32] <rootie_> I thank you for that.
[01:44:42] <Omar-> lol
[01:44:51] <Omar-> you're welcome :)
[01:45:03] <Omar-> thanks to google translator ;)
[01:45:29] <Omar-> well, I know some words in Deutche but I dont know how to write them
[01:48:45] <bacobart> just write them in all caps and you should be alright
[01:49:08] <bacobart> SCHMETTERLING!
[01:49:09] <bacobart> see ;p
[01:49:40] <Omar-> lol bacobart
[01:54:16] <wemini> i have a div with some plain text in it, and two other divs as children
[01:54:21] <wemini> how would you go about changing the div text, but keeping the children divs there and untouched?
[01:59:51] <RobotNinjaPS> @wemini I think I would add an extra class or ID to the main div and just target that, but dont listen to me im a newbie lol :)
[02:01:35] <RobotNinjaPS> btw am I right that jQuery('#datetimepicker1').datetimepicker({ (...) }) creates a datepicker with ID = '#datetimepicker1' ?
[02:03:21] <RobotNinjaPS> so if I need a 2nd datetimepicker I just use jQuery('#datetimepicker2').datetimepicker({
[02:10:47] <bigstylee> RobotNinjaPS; use a class, not an ID then you can have as many datepickers on a page as you wont without the need for adding more js code. jQuery('.datepicker')...
[02:13:22] <RobotNinjaPS> I already have a working datetimepicker
[02:13:25] <RobotNinjaPS> created as <script>jQuery(function($) { $('.inline-date').datetimepicker({ ...
[02:13:40] <RobotNinjaPS> and I want to create 2 new ones
[02:14:36] <bigstylee> <input type="text" class="inline-date" />
[02:14:43] <bigstylee> thats all you need
[02:15:12] <RobotNinjaPS> what about not useing html?
[02:15:42] <bigstylee> you need to attach the datepicker to a form element so the information can be processed by the server presumably?
[02:15:45] <Cork> RobotNinjaPS: the js you have should work just fine as long as you have the extra targets
[02:16:02] <midori-rus> how to send by ajax an array in parameters? I've written a function which sends by post ajax http://kopy.io/mAYBl
[02:16:08] <RobotNinjaPS> @bigstylee exactly
[02:16:10] <midori-rus> But I cant send an array
[02:16:52] <Cork> midori-rus: params doesn't really support arrays
[02:17:11] <Cork> midori-rus: you have to have a key: value combo
[02:17:32] <Cork> { faborites: ['', '', ''] } should work for example
[02:17:43] <bigstylee> RobotNinjaPS: well the form element still needs to be added to the dom. so you could do $('#myForm').append($('<input>').datetimepicker();
[02:17:48] <Cork> it gets converted to favorites[]=&favorites[]=&favorites[]=&favorites[]=
[02:18:44] <Cork> bigstylee: i think he wants an inline datepicker, not an overlay one
[02:18:52] <midori-rus> Cork you mean that i have to make json array?
[02:18:52] <Cork> and it works a little different
[02:18:57] <Cork> no
[02:19:15] <Cork> data: { favorites: $favorites }
[02:19:20] <Cork> should get you going
[02:19:35] <Cork> btw
[02:19:39] <midori-rus> Cork lets I try
[02:19:43] <Cork> midori-rus: what you want to send isn't an array
[02:19:47] <Cork> so the problem comes from there
[02:19:54] <Cork> (you're thinking php not js)
[02:20:01] <Cork> replace [] with {}
[02:20:05] <Cork> and things should just work
[02:20:20] <bigstylee> RobotNinjaPS - http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/#inline is that what your after?
[02:20:59] <Cork> midori-rus: the first answer was wrong
[02:21:00] <midori-rus> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/symbios/2mu7280o/ like this?
[02:21:10] <Cork> ya
[02:21:21] <Cork> midori-rus: a js array doesn't have keys
[02:21:32] <Cork> so line 14-17 isn't valid for arrays
[02:21:41] <Cork> so you want an object instead
[02:21:44] <RobotNinjaPS> I have this one in project already - http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/                     and Im working with Zend framework so I ought to create the form there, I just wanted to test datepicker w/o form first
[02:22:05] <Cork> midori-rus: that said, you might still want to send json instead of params, as it is much more space efficient
[02:22:47] <Cork> midori-rus: also you should prob drop the $ from the variable names :)
[02:23:28] <midori-rus> Cork o_O why? it is my codestyle :)
[02:24:12] <midori-rus> Cork is it bad idea?
[02:24:41] <Cork> midori-rus: it screams that you try to code php instead of js :)
[02:26:16] <midori-rus> Cork i wanned to send my parameters like this http://joxi.ru/vAWYxneIagd1mW
[02:26:41] <Cork> midori-rus: ya, the change i gave you should do that
[02:26:55] <Cork> ah wait no you want an extra key
[02:27:17] <Cork> { favorites: { action: 'del', object_action: 'sale' } }
[02:28:50] <Cork> midori-rus: http://jsfiddle.net/2mu7280o/1/
[02:37:14] <midori-rus> Cork It works! Thank you for understanding
[02:42:57] <footer> Hi all.
[02:43:28] <footer> I got confused on few thigns like this in jquery, appendTo and append, after, insertAfter
[02:44:20] <footer> I was looking at example and it was sth like var Foo = { init: function() { console.log(this) } }
[02:44:32] <footer> why would this will refer to current object?
[02:44:40] <footer> that is Foo
[02:45:15] <footer> also the methods like after, how does it work if I say $('<div class="foo"></div>').after($('h1'))
[02:45:16] <Cork> footer: as soon as you call a function on object.something() something will haev the object as the this variable
[02:45:20] <footer> how that internaly works?
[02:45:47] <footer> Cork: yep, but I will have to call taht in the way new Foo.init()?
[02:45:49] <footer> right
[02:45:55] <Cork> yes
[02:45:59] <footer> okay
[02:46:05] <Cork> .after doesn't work the way you wrote it
[02:46:10] <Cork> that would be insertAfter
[02:46:24] <Cork> after inserts the element on the left after the element on the right
[02:46:41] <Cork> uh.. sorry >_<'
[02:46:46] <Cork> that is what insertAfter does
[02:46:48] <footer> :p
[02:46:50] <Cork> after is the other way around
[02:47:00] <footer> so if I say after something
[02:47:06] <Cork> $('h1').after('<div class="foo"></div>')
[02:47:06] <footer> let's take an example
[02:47:23] <Cork> that would insert the div after each h1
[02:47:25] <footer> so here we are moving h1 after foo?
[02:47:33] <Cork> no
[02:47:53] <footer> but if I do $('h1').after($('h2'))
[02:47:57] <footer> it would move h1 after h2
[02:48:00] <footer> *move*
[02:48:08] <Cork> h2 after h1
[02:48:29] <Cork> what you give you .after is added after the element you have in jquery
[02:48:51] <footer> Ok so it's not the way we speak?
[02:48:55] <Cork> insertAfter moves the jquery object you have after the only you give .insertAfter
[02:48:58] <Cork> no
[02:49:23] <footer> how about appendTo and append
[02:49:25] <Cork> read api.jquery.com it explains this well
[02:49:30] <Cork> same thing
[02:49:35] <footer> are they analogous to insertAfter and after?
[02:49:38] <footer> respectively
[02:49:42] <Cork> yes
[02:49:51] <footer> gotcha, thanks!
[02:49:55] <footer> it was being very confusing
[02:50:18] <Cork> what ppl often have problems with is rather .prepend :)
[02:51:14] <footer> when I $('h1').prepend($('h2'))
[02:51:20] <footer> i have h1 as jquery object
[02:51:25] <footer> and then I prepend h1
[02:51:26] <footer> *h2
[02:51:31] <footer> if I understand correctly now
[02:52:16] <Cork> ya, it will move h2 to be the first child of h1
[02:52:22] <Cork> so that command would actually be invalid
[02:52:33] <Cork> (as h tags can't be children of each other)
[02:53:00] <footer> oho right
[02:56:40] <Omar-> is this correct? isScaled ? e.preventDefault() : return;
[02:56:50] <Omar-> isScaled is a function
[02:57:03] <Omar-> isScaled = function () {
[02:57:03] <Omar->           return $(this).hasClass("scaled");
[02:57:03] <Omar->         };
[02:57:17] <Cork> Omar-: you should know not to do that by now...
[02:57:34] <Cork> or are you intentionally ignoring that ppl has told you not to several times?
[02:57:41] <Omar-> do what, Cork?
[02:57:51] <Cork> you're kidding right?
[02:57:51] <Omar-> no, trust me I'm not
[02:58:01] <Cork> don't paste code in the channel
[02:58:11] <Omar-> oh, true
[02:58:15] <Omar-> my bad
[02:58:16] <Cork> at least not more then single lines
[02:58:28] <Cork> that is like the 4th time you've said that...
[02:58:35] <Omar-> sure, will keep this in mind
[02:59:15] <lite_> rules are so hard to follow
[02:59:20] <Omar-> Cork :)
[02:59:38] <Omar-> lite_ rules are made to be broken :P
[02:59:44] <lite_> not really
[03:00:03] <lite_> rules are made to be enforced
[03:00:32] <Omar-> isScaled ? e.preventDefault() : return; is a correct statement?
[03:00:41] <lite_> no
[03:01:01] <lite_> it's also not a question for #jquery
[03:01:42] <Cork> uh
[03:01:44] <Omar-> what should I replace "return" with?
[03:01:52] <Cork> Omar-: yes that should be an ok statement
[03:02:19] <Cork> even though possibly a bit unconventional
[03:02:21] <lite_> oh right. its coffeescript that doesnt understand it
[03:08:38] <Omar-> thanks lite_ Cork
[03:08:52] <Omar-> if i replace return with null? does it make sense?
[03:09:08] <Omar-> in jQm they use $.noop to return nothing
[03:09:20] <Cork> Omar-: make a fiddle, like you've been told before
[03:09:42] <Cork> you can't make understandable examples in a one line on irc
[03:09:51] <Cork> that is why you're always asked to make a fiddle
[03:10:41] <elvis4526> Hello, I'm peeing myself right now. Is there some specificities about slideDown() that I should be aware of? Every other jQuery effects works besides this one
[03:11:12] <Cork> elvis4526: the element need to be hidden for that to have an effect
[03:11:24] <Cork> so appending a new element and then running .slideDown() won't do anything
[03:11:37] <Cork> if you want a more specific answer
[03:11:41] <Cork> ?paste @ elvis4526
[03:11:41] <b-ot> elvis4526: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[03:11:56] <Omar-> Cork, it's a only a question whether using "return" to return nothing is a good practice and won't lead to any future complications and "wtf" consequences.
[03:12:18] <elvis4526> Cork: I .slideUp() it before
[03:12:19] <Omar-> you have answered it. thanks!
[03:12:30] <R13ose> When I first load the page, I see everything load at once.  How do I see only the first item of the first section load?
[03:12:34] <Cork> Omar-: without the context of waht you're trying to do, it isn't something easy to answer
[03:12:56] <Cork> R13ose: you could set the rest as hidden with .hide()
[03:13:14] <R13ose> Cork: each and every item?
[03:14:34] <Omar-> here is fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/ujz1jxq1/
[03:14:48] <elvis4526> http://pastie.org/10022730
[03:15:04] <elvis4526> .main is only a div
[03:15:08] <Omar-> returning "return" isn't working
[03:16:09] <Omar-> Cork, I have long code. I want to preventDefault() if element is not scaled.
[03:16:39] <Omar-> http://jsbin.com/vemigo/1/edit?html,js line 29
[03:22:16] <Cork> R13ose: yes
[03:23:24] <Cork> Omar-: isScaled doesn't work like that
[03:23:39] <Cork> it doens't inherit the this value from the calling function
[03:24:06] <Cork> so you would have to give it to it if(isScaled(this))
[03:36:42] <mariuscc> I have a div - id "container" and another div inside it. I want to add a click event for container but how do I prevent the event when clicked on the div inside it ?
[03:43:32] <Omar-> Cork you're right, I just noticed that. thanks for the heads up :)
[03:43:42] <Cork> mariuscc: bind a click handler on the container
[03:44:02] <Cork> mariuscc: and then check if the event.target is inside or is the child
[03:44:26] <Cork> if($(event.target).closest('.the-child').length < 1) {}
[03:44:53] <mariuscc> ok thanks will try that after I test if stopPropagation is not wokring
[03:45:36] <Cork> mariuscc: you should avoid stopPropagation
[03:46:11] <mariuscc> why Cork ?
[03:46:17] <Cork> mariuscc: stopPropagation depends on anything on the page never needing that event, and that is a very bold statement to make
[03:46:45] <Cork> mariuscc: while if you do the closest check in the handler that doens't need it, you still leave the event intact
[03:46:52] <Cork> so another script that might need it can still get it
[03:47:09] <Cork> (think page maintaining and next 4+ years)
[03:47:42] <Cork> so my recommendation (from me my self getting burned by it) to avoid stopPropagation
[03:47:51] <mariuscc> you are right
[03:47:52] <Omar-> Cork, jQ doesn't return something like "isbubbled" property in event object?
[03:48:17] <Cork> Omar-: if you just want direct clicks you can do if(this == event.taret)
[03:48:29] <Cork> but you often want to get some bubbling events
[03:48:43] <Omar-> yup, this is what I also do. I check .target
[03:49:01] <Cork> ex <div id="container"><div class="dialog"></div><a></a> <- still want events from this element </div>
[03:49:17] <Cork> and if you do you can't use this == event.target
[03:49:21] <Cork> and .closest is the solution
[03:50:36] <Omar-> if($(event.target).closest('.the-child').length < 1) {} shouldn't be .closest('.parent')? where event is bound to "parent"?
[03:51:38] <Cork> no
[03:52:06] <Cork> .closest checks if the element or any of its parents matches the selector
[03:53:04] <sathish> Can any please help me with a question on Jquery validate plugin, I have created a custom validation using AddMethod, now I want to use this method inside a rule while using rules add.
[03:53:09] <sathish> How do I do this
[03:54:17] <wemini> anyway to include the line breaks when i fetch using .text() ?
[03:54:35] <wemini> i need to capture those line breaks and turn them into <br> ... this is from a div with contenteditable="true"
[03:56:16] <Cork> wemini: use .html()
[03:56:28] <Cork> it should still include it if i remember correctly
[03:57:54] <wemini> .htmldoesn't quite work, has some negative side effects hm
[03:58:36] <Cork> .text() is meant to convert the html to basically what you would get from a select > copy
[03:58:54] <Cork> so line breaks is removed as it doesn't have a markup meaning
[03:58:55] <Omar-> Cork you're absolutely right http://jsfiddle.net/L87nkccu/ never thought of it.
[04:03:47] <RobotNinjaPS> I still need some help using datetimepicker - like for example plain <input type="text" name="dateFrom" class="date" > shows field with beautiful JQuery calendar I can pick dates with, but how do I get to pick time (hours) aswell? (have smth like http://xdsoft.net/jqplugins/datetimepicker/ installed)
[04:15:30] <Omar-> $(elm).css("transform") is cross-browser since jQ is cross-browser?
[04:15:53] <Omar-> returning value of transform (matrix)
[04:19:32] <xec> Omar-: I doubt jquery core will add prefixed versions for you. there are probably plugins for that though
[04:19:59] <xec> Omar-: like https://louisremi.github.io/jquery.transform.js/index.html
[04:21:01] <sathish> Can anyone please help me with a question on Jquery validate plugin, I have created a custom validation using AddMethod, now I want to use this method inside a rule while using rules add. How do I do this.
[04:21:01] <xec> that may have been a bad example, demo doesn't seem to do anything :(
[04:22:14] <cyberbrai> http://jsfiddle.net/Kq7rn/16/
[04:22:36] <Cork> xec: the need for prefixes is actually finally slowly going away
[04:22:36] <cyberbrai>  alert($(this).attr('id')); with the help of this the get id how can i get text()
[04:23:02] <xec> Cork: that's true, but safari and old IE is still lagging behind
[04:23:14] <Cork> cyberbrai: sidenote, i would recommend use console.log instead of alert
[04:23:28] <cyberbrai> why not cork
[04:23:29] <Cork> alert is a bad tool for debugging as it can sometimes affect how code works
[04:24:04] <Cork> cyberbrai: and about the original question you want something other then $(this).text()?
[04:24:19] <cyberbrai> yup
[04:25:07] <cyberbrai> cork i use this $(this).text() it's work but when i dropped on same module another time it's give me whole li text
[04:25:11] <Cork> also you might want to look at droppable
[04:25:26] <Cork> ah
[04:25:34] <Cork> ya, you can't get just the text in the li
[04:25:40] <Cork> you will get all text inside the li
[04:25:45] <Cork> including children
[04:27:21] <cyberbrai> actually it's give me a all children name (text ) i don't know why but if i use $(this).attr('id') just give me the id where i dropped
[04:27:43] <Cork> ya, cause the text inside it is the element and all its children
[04:27:52] <Cork> while attr id is the attribute id
[04:28:07] <Cork> there isn't a way around that except cloning the element and removing the children
[04:28:44] <cyberbrai> Cork i don't want to remove children any
[04:28:59] <Cork> cyberbrai: uh, you missed the point
[04:29:07] <cyberbrai> what point
[04:29:13] <Omar-> xec as far as I know, jQ adds prefixes as of 1.8
[04:29:19] <Cork> <div>a<span>b</span></div> $('div').text() === 'ab'
[04:29:46] <Cork> only way to remove be is to do var copy = $('div').clone(); copy.children().remove(); copy.text()
[04:29:55] <Omar-> xec I've tested it in iPhone safar and it returned transform matrix
[04:30:04] <cyberbrai> oooh it's too long cork
[04:30:12] <Cork> cyberbrai: meaning, if you want only that data, change either the element structure or store it as an attribute
[04:30:30] <Cork> for example store it as data-name="" for example
[04:32:51] <cyberbrai> Cork: ok lets see it's work or not
[04:34:02] <cyberbrai> Cork i found some fiddle on drag and drop http://jsfiddle.net/kbwood/23AvA/2/   can we test on this
[04:34:07] <xec> Omar-: oh really, that is very cool
[04:39:18] <Cork> ya, style.transform returns a matrix
[04:39:32] <Cork> it doesn't handle the prefixes for you though
[04:40:38] <cyberbrai> Cork how can i save the data name i am not getting your idea
[04:41:08] <Omar-> xec yup :)
[04:41:09] <Cork> <li data-name="content">content<ul><li>...</li></ul></li>
[04:41:12] <Cork> you store it twice
[04:41:26] <Omar-> touch events are driving me crazy :(
[04:41:38] <Cork> ya, they are ... "interesting" :D
[04:41:52] <Omar-> they are :/
[04:42:11] <Omar-> i'm almost there...............http://jsbin.com/vemigo/1/edit?html,js
[04:42:27] <Omar-> managed to create double-tap to zoom
[04:42:41] <Omar-> while maintaining viewport as is
[04:44:45] <Omar-> I'm stuck as when to preventDefault(). I want page to scroll when image isnt scaled. When it's scaled, allow user to drag it without scrolling the page
[04:45:13] <Omar-> right now i'm preventing default in touchmove not in touchstart
[04:45:23] <Omar-> so maybe the problem is within touchstart
[05:31:42] <sathish> Can anyone please help me with a question on Jquery validate plugin, I have created a custom validation using AddMethod, now I want to use this method inside a rule while using rules add. How do I do this.
[05:33:59] <MikeD_> that sounds like a jsfiddle example would be a good place to start
[05:42:18] <decx> you use the method the same you would any other
[05:50:11] <kokut> Hello, is there a way to tell in which script (and where) a dom element's attributes are being modified?
[05:51:09] <kokut> because i'm working on a site that uses a lot of scripts and its going to take a lot of time to check one by one, not only that, i don't have a clue of where to start, or even if it's a script what is actually modifying the element's attributes
[05:51:43] <decx> eliminate scripts one by one
[05:52:09] <decx> if you dont take the time to familiarize yourself with the project then you'll end up crazy anyway
[05:56:58] <kokut> decx: good idea, is there a way to block them without actually removing them from the website? because that would take a lot of time really
[05:57:36] <decx> how much time can it take to uncomment a line
[06:00:28] <kokut> the web site includes a lot of scripts from many different places, some directories have 20 nested folders and its going to take a lot of time to figure out where each one of them is being included
[06:03:43] <RobotNinjaPS> idk I tend to just search in my IDE if the name is specific enough
[06:05:58] <RobotNinjaPS> then I would search by name, name.attr( etc
[06:07:05] <RobotNinjaPS> oh I see you figured that out in javascript chat already ;)
[06:14:44] <strelok> $.ajax call returning entire json file as text on the screen instead of being evaluated by my if statements
[06:19:18] <Omar-> strelok show us the code
[06:20:01] <strelok> Here you are sir: http://jsbin.com/perofoyece/3/edit
[06:20:14] <bigstylee> strelok you headers of the response are most likely wrong
[06:20:55] <strelok> im still extremely confused by "headers" I have to look int oit
[06:21:15] <strelok> Im not getting that error message though
[06:22:24] <bigstylee> it wouldn't be an error message. there is a header called "Content-Type" which tells your browser/application/jquery how to interrupt the result. i suspect your response is saying its "text/html" when it should be "text/javascript"
[06:30:05] <midori-rus> Cork hey friend. Could help me once more?
[06:31:12] <Cork> ?ask
[06:31:12] <b-ot> Cork: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[06:31:50] <Cork> strelok: you most likely send the wrong content-type from the server
[06:32:17] <Cork> the server should send Content-Type: application/json for jquery to know it should parse it as json
[06:33:06] <Cork> bigstylee: actually text/javascript is the fallback header the correct one is application/json
[06:37:43] <strelok> Cork, bigstylee: Okay, I'll try to figure out how to add "content-type" in the response
[06:38:03] <Cork> strelok: what serves the response?
[06:38:11] <Cork> (what language)
[06:38:28] <patsToms> can't understand
[06:38:38] <patsToms> is there any way to do $.get('url', yoyoy...
[06:38:57] <patsToms> with js objects which will be used as get params
[06:38:59] <patsToms> any ideas?
[06:39:03] <Cork> srue
[06:39:26] <Cork> $.get('url', { a: 1, b: 'something' }) => url?a=1&b=something
[06:40:58] <patsToms> thanks Cork
[06:41:49] <strelok> Cork: res.json({ success: true});
[06:41:55] <strelok> Cork: jsbin: http://jsbin.com/perofoyece/3/edit
[06:43:02] <Cork> ah nodejs
[06:44:07] <strelok> yes
[06:44:53] <Cork> strelok: https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_response_setheader_name_value
[06:49:09] <strelok> Cork: Okay thanks, i'm kind of new to this, I have put it above the "res.json" response like this: " res.setHeader("Content-Type", "application/json"); "
[06:49:18] <strelok> Cork: but that isnt working
[06:50:42] <Cork> hmm
[06:50:53] <Cork> strelok: actually look at the response from the server (in the browser)
[06:51:05] <Cork> (comment out the setHeader)
[06:51:34] <Cork> i'm not a big nodejs user, but it looks like .json should do the correct thing by default
[06:51:43] <Cork> so check that in the network tab in the browser
[06:51:48] <strelok> Okay
[06:51:50] <strelok> 1 se
[06:51:52] <strelok> c
[06:53:15] <deepy> So, I attempted to make my plugin work with .each() as someone insisted that I do, but now I am getting 'undefined is not a function' and I'm not sure what's wrong
[06:53:19] <deepy> http://jsfiddle.net/msov45gb/ - is my code
[06:53:27] <strelok> Cork: Yeah it's loading, but it's redirecting the page to just " {"success":true} " too....
[06:53:46] <Cork> strelok: sure, check the response headers though
[06:54:02] <Cork> the content isn't the interesting part :)
[06:54:39] <Cork> deepy: this.attr('id'); => $(this).attr('id');
[06:54:51] <Cork> this directly inside a plugin is jquery
[06:54:59] <Cork> this inside an each loop is the raw dom element
[06:55:01] <strelok> Cork: what am I to look for in the content headers ?
[06:55:07] <Cork> so you need to wrap it again
[06:55:25] <Cork> strelok: hopefully a content-Type header
[06:57:29] <strelok> Under Response Headers it says: Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8
[07:00:24] <strelok> Cork: Under Response Headers it says: Content-Type:application/json; charset=utf-8
[07:03:20] <midori-rus> if change in ajax success function data attribute and after that second time click the element the data attribute return seems not change
[07:03:56] <midori-rus> I am using $( "#favorite_list" ).on( "click", "i", function(e) {}
[07:04:08] <deepy> Cork: ah, thanks
[07:04:39] <midori-rus> Cork boss, how to bind always updated data attr?
[07:08:30] <Cork> strelok: nice, so that isn't the problem
[07:08:40] <Cork> strelok: so the info i found was correct
[07:09:37] <Cork> strelok: ok, so lets back up a bit; is response "{success:true}" instead of an object?
[07:10:14] <Cork> midori-rus: could you fiddle the code you talk about?
[07:14:11] <midori-rus> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/symbios/xhfL4dks/
[07:15:18] <Cork> midori-rus: yikes, i would prob not use a global variable for "thisEl"
[07:15:31] <Cork> or any of the other options actually
[07:15:39] <Cork> that is kinda scary
[07:16:09] <midori-rus> Cork why not?
[07:16:16] <Cork> cause you do async code
[07:16:27] <Cork> the variable could change value before you try to use it
[07:16:56] <Cork> also it isn't considered good practice (mainly cause of said reason) to use global variables if you don't need to
[07:17:16] <midori-rus> Cork what is the better way in this case?
[07:17:26] <Cork> you send them as arguments anyway
[07:17:33] <Cork> to just don't make them globals
[07:18:00] <Cork> and add the this as an additional argument for the function (FavoritesController)
[07:18:36] <midori-rus> Cork like this? FavoritesController (id, action, type, object, this);
[07:18:44] <Cork> for example ya
[07:18:54] <Cork> and define the variables in the click handler
[07:18:59] <Cork> var id = ; for example
[07:19:08] <midori-rus> Cork then i dont need other arguments
[07:19:14] <Cork> true
[07:19:21] <midori-rus> lets i try
[07:20:02] <Cork> except for that, i don't see a reason why the modification wouldn't work
[07:22:04] <midori-rus> Cork http://jsfiddle.net/symbios/xhfL4dks/1/
[07:22:07] <midori-rus> like this?
[07:23:19] <Cork> midori-rus: yes
[07:23:43] <Cork> preventDefault(e); <-- preventDefault doesn't take an argument though
[07:23:50] <Cork> its e.preventDefault()
[07:24:01] <Cork> also i would prob call it as the first command in the event handler
[07:25:02] <midori-rus> SyntaxError: missing formal parameter
[07:25:02] <midori-rus> 	
[07:25:02] <midori-rus> function FavoritesController (this) {
[07:25:14] <midori-rus> console says me
[07:26:18] <motaka2> hello can anyone please dropdown menus on the left side of the grid overlap the underneath menu ?
[07:26:19] <motaka2> http://fa.noondreams.com/Ezr/Persons/Persons/NavList?_=1426256474062
[07:30:42] <Cork> ah, sory
[07:30:43] <Cork> lol
[07:30:51] <Cork> midori-rus: you can't use this as a variable name
[07:31:01] <Cork> you need to give it another name (sorry missed that)
[07:31:29] <motaka2> Cork: would u please check my case too ?
[07:32:16] <Cork> not enough info
[07:32:32] <Cork> what menu?
[07:33:02] <motaka2> the menu on the far left of the grid
[07:33:14] <motaka2> the one with three horizental
[07:33:17] <motaka2> lines
[07:33:56] <midori-rus> Cork I have changed it http://jsfiddle.net/symbios/xhfL4dks/2/ but it binds always del attr
[07:34:10] <Cork> motaka2: i think you've forgotten that we aren't logged in again :)
[07:34:30] <Cork> midori-rus: you don't need the content: el
[07:34:36] <midori-rus> Cork in 33 line i am changing data attr, and it changes
[07:34:52] <AlluringMe> Hi
[07:34:58] <Cork> midori-rus: del attr?
[07:35:02] <Cork> not sure what you mean there
[07:35:12] <AlluringMe> a quick fiddle help to check if event delegation is handled properly over here. thanks
[07:35:19] <Cork> midori-rus: http://jsfiddle.net/xhfL4dks/3/
[07:35:26] <AlluringMe> http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/
[07:35:53] <Cork> AlluringMe: you're not doing any delegation
[07:36:14] <AlluringMe> I am sorry I mean if I am using event handlers properly
[07:36:15] <motaka2> Cork: I removed the ACL
[07:36:19] <Cork> AlluringMe: http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/1/
[07:36:30] <motaka2> would u please check it now?
[07:36:45] <Cork> still only get a login screen
[07:36:55] <AlluringMe> oh sec I will uupdate the fiddle
[07:36:57] <AlluringMe> sorry
[07:37:09] <midori-rus> Cork $(el).attr('data-action', "add"); changes attr, but when i click it ita allways gets del del del del
[07:37:17] <strelok> Cork: nice! so any idea why it's still returning the actually json text instead of evaluating itself in the if statements i have sent up?
[07:37:40] <Cork> midori-rus: how are you checking it on click?
[07:37:40] <midori-rus> strelok привет
[07:37:50] <AlluringMe> Please check this: http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/2/
[07:38:00] <midori-rus> by Firebug
[07:38:03] <Cork> strelok: that was my last question
[07:38:20] <Cork> strelok: ok, so lets back up a bit; is response "{success:true}" instead of an object? <--
[07:38:57] <strelokk> Cork: nice! so any idea why it's still returning the actually json text instead of evaluating itself in the if statements i have sent up?
[07:39:11] <Cork> AlluringMe: not sure what you want me to look at
[07:39:19] <motaka2> Cork: I am really sorry now I removed them all. but the problem happens in ajax load
[07:39:25] <Cork> O_o
[07:39:29] <motaka2> let me do something else
[07:39:32] <AlluringMe> Cork, I want to check if this is correct. I am very new to Jquery
[07:39:35] <Cork> strelokk: could you please answer the question?
[07:40:12] <strelokk> my internet just disconnected me like 10 times, i think i missed your question, sorry
[07:40:18] <Cork> AlluringMe: not sure what you want me to look at, so... maybe?
[07:40:20] <AlluringMe> Is the code and events coded correctly in code. yester Robert pointed me to a resource.
[07:40:27] <Cork> strelok: ok, so lets back up a bit; is response "{success:true}" instead of an object? <--
[07:41:13] <Cork> AlluringMe: i would delegate the event handler to ulv instead of adding it for each li
[07:41:23] <Cork> other then that, ya it looks fine
[07:41:43] <Cork> AlluringMe: http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/3/
[07:41:53] <AlluringMe> How will that help? What are the implications of doing something like that?
[07:42:15] <Cork> AlluringMe: it adds one event handler to the abc parent
[07:42:27] <Cork> instead of adding one event handler in a loop to each li element
[07:42:40] <Cork> then it listens for bubbling events from the li elements instead
[07:42:47] <Cork> it means it catches new elements if you add them
[07:43:03] <Cork> and it is cheapter for the browser, cause it has to process less event handlers
[07:43:25] <AlluringMe> I think I understand. So the parent can be used to fire up the child elements in case of additions
[07:43:28] <AlluringMe> I guess
[07:43:49] <Cork> not sure what you mean there
[07:44:10] <v0lksman> how would you test to see if you've hit the client storage limit?
[07:44:26] <strelokk> Cork: yes, all im sending in the res is that one simple piece of information. Everything im doing is right here: http://jsbin.com/perofoyece/3/edit
[07:44:50] <Cork> v0lksman: in what context?
[07:45:24] <Cork> strelokk: except what you actually sees inside response
[07:45:54] <AlluringMe> Thanks for your help cork. I will read the resources I was pointed to yester again.
[07:46:36] <AlluringMe> Have a nice day.
[07:47:05] <v0lksman> Cork: I'm using twitters typeahead with handlebars and bloodhound and I have it prefetch the tokens.  It all works but I cant seem to get handlbars to render a custom template with the prefectched response.  Wondering if it's because I'm hitting some client side limit with my data
[07:47:44] <Cork> v0lksman: that doesn't really answer the question i asked
[07:47:55] <Cork> is this just js variables? localStorage?
[07:48:00] <Cork> offline storeage?
[07:48:04] <Cork> indexeddb?
[07:48:08] <Cork> or...?
[07:48:14] <Cork> cache?
[07:48:49] <motaka2> Cork: are you there?
[07:48:51] <v0lksman> Cork: no clue really.  just following the docs and they mention that you can hit a limit on the client with the prefetch method.
[07:49:09] <Cork> v0lksman: would guess at just variables then
[07:49:22] <Cork> and sure there is memory limitations for browsers like any other programs
[07:49:33] <Cork> but not anything specifically for how much a page can consume
[07:49:45] <Cork> motaka2: ya, you said you would come again
[07:50:08] <motaka2> Cork: :) yes, sorry, I PMed you
[07:50:21] <Cork> that will be quite pointless as i have pm disabled
[07:50:50] <motaka2> Cork: how can i send you credentials my friend?
[07:51:17] <v0lksman> Cork: I'm going to jsbin my problem as I think that will be more productive... :)
[07:51:17] <Cork> motaka2: i will most likely not have time if it needs to be that involved
[07:51:21] <Cork> i'm at work after all :)
[07:51:41] <motaka2> it is just a simple user and pass
[07:52:41] <decx> recreate your problem in a fiddle for the public, private help has consulting fees
[07:53:26] <motaka2> decx: since it just happens when reloading in ajax, it is very difficult to recrete it
[07:53:54] <decx> you can ajax in another fiddle in a fiddle
[07:54:22] <decx> or from somethng like www.json-generator.com
[08:01:34] <motaka2> decx: Ireally cant do that
[08:03:52] <cyberbrai> jquery-get-text-element-without-child-element
[08:04:06] <cyberbrai> var r = $(this).attr("id");
[08:04:07] <cyberbrai> console.log($("#"+r).clone().children().remove().end().text());
[08:04:19] <cyberbrai> i am using this code but it's return nothing
[08:04:33] <Cork> <_<'
[08:04:51] <Cork> did you miss the suggestion to just store the text in an attribute?
[08:05:22] <cyberbrai> no Cork
[08:05:38] <cyberbrai> just a mistake sorry for that
[08:05:58] <cyberbrai> how can i remove the child elemment
[08:06:00] <decx> just grab the first textnode with vanilla js
[08:06:03] <Cork> cloning and modifying a clone just to get the text from the parent is a waist of cpu time
[08:06:24] <cyberbrai> so any other  alternative
[08:06:27] <Cork> cyberbrai: not sure you can do it in a one liner
[08:06:39] <cyberbrai> Cork how
[08:06:47] <Cork> cyberbrai: i gave you how
[08:06:51] <cyberbrai> plz
[08:07:21] <Cork> but like i said the clear solution is to have the source generating the elements just put the content in a data-label=""
[08:07:23] <Cork> attribute
[08:07:29] <Cork> then you don't need to do these hacks
[08:09:48] <cyberbrai> <li id="list" > <span data-label="sunny" >sunny</span></li>
[08:09:58] <cyberbrai> so how can i get in controler
[08:10:18] <Cork> uh, if you already have a span you don't need the attribute
[08:10:31] <Cork> just grab the span instead of the li
[08:11:04] <cyberbrai> how can i do that if there is lot of child li
[08:11:31] <midori-rus> stupid jquery!
[08:11:44] <cyberbrai> awesome jquery
[08:11:44] <Cork> $(this).children('span').text() for example
[08:11:58] <midori-rus> cyberbrai fucking jquery!
[08:12:00] <midori-rus> sorry
[08:12:22] <cyberbrai> Cork ok wait a minute
[08:12:53] <cyberbrai> midori-rus please don't use abusive language
[08:14:21] <midori-rus> cyberbrai sorry, just angry to this lib
[08:14:41] <Cork> midori-rus: what's the problem?
[08:15:12] <midori-rus> Cork i cant bind just changed and updated data attr
[08:15:35] <Cork> events are for user action
[08:15:48] <Cork> changing of element or attributes isn't events
[08:15:52] <Cork> so ya, you can't bind them
[08:16:08] <Cork> if that is what you actually mean
[08:16:14] <midori-rus> http://jsfiddle.net/symbios/vgcpv9qd/
[08:16:18] <Cork> never made clear what you're trying to do
[08:16:52] <midori-rus> Cork 26 line chnages data-action from del to add
[08:17:04] <Cork> and you still haven't made clear what that means
[08:17:17] <midori-rus> but if I click it second time it anyway sends del, even it was changed to add
[08:17:23] <Cork> last i asked for how you check the value on click
[08:17:30] <Cork> and you still haven't answered that
[08:17:56] <midori-rus> Cork could you repeat and explain the question, sorry
[08:17:57] <Cork> and soon it will be too late cause i will be going in 2 minutes
[08:17:59] <Zlepper> I can't find a specific bootstrap irc channel, but it's related to jquery too, so here goes: The $(element).popover() function in bootstrap, does it return the element that was clicked on the popover that was made?
[08:18:12] <Cork> Zlepper: ##bootstrap
[08:18:22] <Cork> double #
[08:18:50] <Zlepper> I might have derped then, i was just forwarded to ##namespace. But thanks
[08:18:55] <midori-rus> Cork i have tryed with click function

[08:56:13] <PCatinean> hey guys
[08:56:32] <PCatinean> Is there a way to specify min max values for jquery validator using only classes or do I have to call the jquery validator manually and apply the rules
[08:56:44] <PCatinean> Meaning I have to parse min_nr max_nr and do jquery.validator rules?
[08:58:02] <bttf> moonbox: thanks, i'll try that and let you know
[08:58:49] <moonbox> bttf: Ok, i've made a bin if you want it. But finding it yourself is always better :)
[08:59:56] <ss7prowla_> grr
[09:02:17] <decx> you can use the number input field if you dont care about legacy browsers pcatinean
[09:04:05] <PCatinean> decx, will that limit to certain numbers?
[09:04:11] <PCatinean> < 30, > 10 ?
[09:04:39] <bttf> moonbox: sweet, yeah i agree but i could definitely use your bin as reference

If you fill in the form up until summary and then click on step 1, and then step 2 you’ll notice the scale is wrong on step 2 onward. Here’s the JS http://kopy.io/xJjp7
[09:06:36] <kingfisher64> I don't have control over the content of the third party content of the iframe
[09:06:46] <garethdaine> Does anyone have any idea what might be going on in my code to create this glitch?

[09:08:05] <decx> PCatinean yes the number input type as a max min and step attribute
[09:08:15] <PCatinean> ahh ok I see
[09:08:24] <PCatinean> Legacy browsers might count though so
[09:08:37] <decx> it'll just be a normal input for old browsers
[09:08:44] <decx> there are polyfills though

[09:15:32] <jfive> but only one of the numbers/digits is "visible" (the rest are hidden with css)
[09:15:41] <jfive> is it possible through jquery to figure out which one?
[09:15:49] <robertmaxrees> how are they hidden?
[09:16:19] <jfive> you can take a look at the code here: http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/make-a-stopwatch-using-css3-without-images-or-javascript
[09:16:29] <jfive> hidden with css3 animations, essentially
[09:17:50] <decx> dont check your element if its visible, save your state in an array and use that to control what you do
[09:18:08] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get the current time, jfive?
[09:18:15] <jfive> robertmaxrees: yeah
[09:19:12] <NinjaBanjo> new Date()
[09:20:49] <decx> i dont think css3 transitions like that save their state somewhere
[09:21:05] <robertmaxrees> jfive you'll have to do the calculations manually based on how it's moving the numbers around.
[09:21:09] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, just JS to power it.
[09:21:28] <NinjaBanjo> ^^ no reason why js would be bad
[09:21:45] <robertmaxrees> it's a cute trick to use CSS for it.
[09:21:52] <robertmaxrees> but this is one of the limitations of doing that.
[09:22:05] <jfive> robertmaxrees: I thought that might be the case, thanks!
[09:22:05] <PCatinean> can I have some help please? I have made the code generate classes with min_int, max_int in order for me to do validation via Jquery Validator, I am parsing all classes of each field and checking for these terms and try to apply
[09:22:07] <NinjaBanjo> and with pure css, the gpu on some devices wouldn't handle that many redraws in a second
[09:22:18] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ PCatinean
[09:22:19] <b-ot> PCatinean: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[09:22:21] <PCatinean> Do I have to build a hash and pass it at the end to the validate() method? if so how can I do that?
[09:22:38] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, http://hastebin.com/pajasiyata.coffee
[09:23:19] <robertmaxrees> i must be lost - your question isn't making sense to me.
[09:23:20] <PCatinean> I need to define rules as a global variable or something so I can access it withing that method and add fields as I find them one by one?
[09:23:28] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, which part?
[09:23:35] <garethdaine> Anyone got any ideas on this problem at all http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29037224/issues-with-jquery-multiple-step-form
[09:23:50] <PCatinean> I generate some input fields that expect integers, I want to further restrict that field to values with min and max
[09:24:02] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean ah, then you need to use a custom validator function.
[09:24:08] <PCatinean> The only way I can think of applying that restriction is setting classes on the input field
[09:24:12] <PCatinean> hmm, ok...
[09:24:15] <decx> validate has a max rule
[09:24:28] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you need some kind of unique identifier for the field obviously.
[09:24:34] <decx> if you want to restrict the actual input you'll have to use a number fieldtype / polyfill
[09:25:23] <PCatinean> number fieldtype / polyfill?
[09:25:39] <PCatinean> I wanted to apply min max on the actual fields using a loop
[09:25:46] <decx> something like that http://jsfiddle.net/decx/xv5mf/3/
[09:25:53] * PCatinean checks
[09:25:55] <robertmaxrees> why would you use a loop?
[09:25:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[09:26:56] <decx> man i would write that so different now ^^
[09:27:05] <decx> what a year of doing js again can do
[09:27:13] <robertmaxrees> right?
[09:27:21] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, so I can build a hash that I will pass to the validate
[09:27:35] <PCatinean> Pass through each input field, check the classes, add to the hash then validate
[09:27:43] <PCatinean> Isn't that what the class is doing anyhow?
[09:27:45] <PCatinean> more or less
[09:27:52] <robertmaxrees> i feel like you're convoluting things.
[09:28:05] <robertmaxrees> you point jquery validate at a form and tell it which fields get which rules.
[09:28:12] <robertmaxrees> which is done by the input names iirc.
[09:28:13] <PCatinean> Quite possibly I havn't done much JS/Jquery in years and not much even then
[09:28:23] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, that is correct
[09:28:25] <robertmaxrees> right.
[09:28:47] <PCatinean> But in order to build the rules, I need to go through all the fields and get the class names, parse them and then I know what min/max values it's allowed
[09:29:01] <robertmaxrees> i wouldn't do that personally.
[09:29:02] <PCatinean> How else would I know if field x allows values from a-b and field y from c to d?
[09:29:05] <PCatinean> Okay
[09:29:31] <robertmaxrees> use a custom validator that checks the data-minval and data-maxval of the input instead.
[09:29:38] <robertmaxrees> otherwise you're working too hard.
[09:30:15] <PCatinean> You're right, initially I went with that plan but then I wanted to keep jquery validator's style of putting stuff into classes
[09:30:21] <PCatinean> Put you are very right this is extra work
[09:30:26] <PCatinean> and pretty silly...
[09:30:31] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[09:30:32] * PCatinean sees it now
[09:30:43] <PCatinean> it's like I was -_- and now O_O
[09:30:45] <PCatinean> XD
[09:30:49] <PCatinean> Thanks man
[09:33:43] <garethdaine> Any ideas on my Stac Overflow question folks? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29037224/issues-with-jquery-multiple-step-form
[09:33:51] <PCatinean> but that fiddle has those nice and sexy +- widgets that decx pasted
[09:33:52] <PCatinean> I want those
[09:33:55] <randomguy> it's large
[09:34:03] <robertmaxrees> garethdaine that's a helluva lot of code and a bigass question.
[09:34:11] <garethdaine> I know man
[09:34:12] <robertmaxrees> my eyes kind of glazed over.
[09:34:16] <randomguy> lol
[09:34:19] <garethdaine> lol
[09:34:23] <garethdaine> Mine too
[09:34:25] <garethdaine> lol
[09:34:33] <robertmaxrees> so break it down into smaller questions imo.
[09:34:34] <PCatinean> what is large?
[09:34:42] <decx> PCatinean the +- thing is a direct dropin replacement for input type="number"
[09:34:48] <garethdaine> It’s basically between lines 79 - 158 for the first part
[09:35:06] <PCatinean> decx, and how old does the browser need to be to support it, and if it does not support it what happens?
[09:35:26] <decx> if it doesnt support it i'll just be a normal type="text"
[09:35:40] <robertmaxrees> garethdaine that's almost 80 lines of code for me to dump through.
[09:35:42] <PCatinean> I guess that's the perfect scenario if it has a fallback
[09:35:45] <PCatinean> decx, what about float values?
[09:35:58] <decx> change the steps option
[09:36:12] <PCatinean> and is it a standard library?
[09:36:24] <PCatinean> or I have to include it
[09:36:47] <decx> it's just a helperfunction for jquery
[09:36:57] <decx> the actual number polyfill is pretty big
[09:37:18] <PCatinean> so I have to include a library with it
[09:37:29] <decx> http://jonstipe.github.io/number-polyfill/demo.html
[09:37:53] <decx> i had to implement something but this thing was too complex for my needs so i made my own (see fiddle)
[09:38:10] <randomguy> huh, i've never seen $(document).on(action, class, callback);  is that the same as $(class).on(class, callback); ?
[09:38:16] <garethdaine> robertmaxrees: I’ve updated the question to break it down as best as possible
[09:38:23] <robertmaxrees> randomguy that's the delegated version.
[09:38:40] <decx> the document will listen to any events from that specific target
[09:38:55] <robertmaxrees> that way if "class" is added after the binding is run, it'll still work.
[09:39:02] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events for more.
[09:39:03] <randomguy> interesting
[09:39:28] <randomguy> new tool in the toolbelt, B-)
[09:39:31] <decx> it's best to anchor these listeners not as high up though
[09:39:32] <PCatinean> I will keep that in mind it looks really cool
[09:39:40] <robertmaxrees> ^ listen to decx there.
[09:39:46] <robertmaxrees> bind as low as you can get away with.
[09:39:49] <PCatinean> If the browser does not support it, the validation will still be in place
[09:40:15] <decx> it's still another thing to load
[09:40:20] <robertmaxrees> i also use them when i have a lot elements on a page that need the same listener.  the delegated one has slightly lower overhead in some ways and makes things easier.
[09:40:25] <decx> addMethod on validate would only be 2-3 lines
[09:41:06] <garethdaine> Is this all to me or someone else here?
[09:41:21] <robertmaxrees> garethdaine directing people to SO links in here is kind of weird lol
[09:41:24] <randomguy> sorry gare: i side swiped ya, heh
[09:41:24] <decx> only the listening stuff is for you ^^
[09:41:55] <garethdaine> robertmaxrees: lol, how come?
[09:42:16] <robertmaxrees> you'll notice that people that get the fastest help are the ones with small, succinct questions.
[09:42:34] <garethdaine> Yeah, thing is, mine isn’t a small succint question
[09:42:44] <robertmaxrees> then make it into a series of them :)
[09:42:57] <decx> breaking up your project in small repeatable problems is a very valuable skill
[09:42:57] <garethdaine> Not sure I can mate :-)
[09:43:15] <decx> not just to get help but also to develop in teams efficiently
[09:43:18] <robertmaxrees> https://css-tricks.com/reduced-test-cases/ is a good place to start.
[09:43:22] <fatmandown> guise
[09:43:25] <fatmandown> www.overapi.com :D
[09:43:30] <robertmaxrees> http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1 is another great guide
[09:44:11] <randomguy> garethdaine: personal observation.  why can i click next if I have not chosen any delegates, only to have to click back to add some? :P
[09:44:56] <garethdaine> Yeah, good point and somethign I’ll sort out but for the time being I want to sort the issues I’m having but you’re right, and it’s somethign I will sort :-)
[09:45:41] <PCatinean> Is there a way I can apply a custom function on all fields in Jquery Validator?
[09:46:34] <robertmaxrees> http://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod/
[09:46:36] <randomguy> garethdaine: you got a fake test CCN your using?
[09:46:59] <PCatinean> robertmaxrees, yes but then I still have to add that custom method to all fields no?
[09:46:59] <randomguy> garethdaine: or have I gone past the point the error occurs?
[09:47:00] <garethdaine> What’s a CCN?
[09:47:02] <robertmaxrees> PCatinean read the docs on the site and search around on google.
[09:47:36] <randomguy> garethdaine: CCN.  it's asking for one.  i'm not giving you mine, :P
[09:47:49] <randomguy> garethdaine: Credit Card Number
[09:47:53] <garethdaine> Oh I get ya, credit card number
[09:47:55] <garethdaine> Hahaha
[09:48:03] <garethdaine> Yes I do but you’ve gone past the error
[09:48:23] <randomguy> k
[09:48:33] <motaka2> is there a way to make objects live ?
[09:48:44] <robertmaxrees> "live"?
[09:48:44] <garethdaine> Basically if you fill in the form up until summary, then click step 1, then step 2, you’ll notice the scaling is wrong
[09:49:02] <garethdaine> That’s the first issue
[09:49:12] <garethdaine> randomguy ^^
[09:49:38] <garethdaine> The second issue concerns serialize() remembering old form data once it’s been dynamically removed
[09:49:50] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time, to.
[09:49:56] <garethdaine> Specifically the delegate data
[09:50:04] <garethdaine> Sure
[09:50:19] <motaka2> robertmaxrees: yes, events work on my menu when i load them without ajax, but when I load them with ajax, they dont work
[09:50:28] <garethdaine> It’s Friday, ten to 5 and beer is calling :-)
[09:50:40] <robertmaxrees> motaka2 you need to use delegated event listners.
[09:51:04] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/on/#direct-and-delegated-events and http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/ are good resources.
[09:51:13] <randomguy> garethdaine: is the summary before the delegates part?  i ask cause on none of these modals have I seen "Summary"
[09:51:33] <Zeranoe> Is there a way to posistion an element under the cursor using jquery
[09:51:44] <garethdaine> The summary is after the delegate bit randomguy
[09:51:46] <randomguy> garethdaine: ah, nvm
[09:52:13] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe you can grab the current x/y of the cursor and pop something there, Zeranoe.  kind of depends on what you're doing though.
[09:53:01] <randomguy> garethdaine: i see the issue now, weird.  hold on...
[09:53:26] <garethdaine> Yeah, the bookingForm variable won’t contain the old data, but the serilized string does
[09:53:30] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: I'm looking to position an element under the cursor when I click
[09:53:43] <robertmaxrees> Zeranoe for what?
[09:53:45] <garethdaine> It’s like it’s being cached
[09:53:54] <robertmaxrees> like, a warning? a WYSIWYG?
[09:54:45] <shwaiil> what's the best practice for triggering $(window).on('resize.my-namespace-foo'); from $('element').on('foo', function () {    trigger window resize.my-namespace-foo  }); ?
[09:54:53] <shwaiil> guess it's a bad practice
[09:55:09] <robertmaxrees> shwaiil abstract out the code and call that instead.
[09:55:24] <Zeranoe> robertmaxrees: It's pretty complicated, but it's a dragable element
[09:56:08] <shwaiil> robertmaxrees: yeah thanks for looking. just that I have to change a whole jquery lib for that, I'll see what I can do
[09:56:22] <robertmaxrees> you can .trigger() events if you want.
[09:56:30] <shwaiil> a bit about it. I've got a slick js carousel that responds to window obj, but I need it to respond to different element
[09:56:38] <shwaiil> robertmaxrees: yeah, should be slow though no ?
[09:57:09] <k1t> shwaiil: you shouldnt ever have to change the jquery library, unless you're crazy advanced. You can always extend it, though
[09:57:21] <shwaiil> k1t: not jquery, slickjs
[09:57:28] <k1t> oh ok lol
[09:57:32] <k1t> :)
[09:57:39] <decx> changing a library is never a good idea
[09:57:40] <shwaiil> sorry
[09:57:43] <decx> unless you fork it
[09:57:55] <decx> be it jquery or a jquery plugin
[09:57:56] <shwaiil> decx: yup and rename it .custom.js
[09:58:29] <decx> no i obviously rename it decxs.original.slider.js 600 bucks plz client
[09:58:43] <decx> ^^
[09:59:17] <PCatinean> Why in God's name does the Jquery Validator ignore the required class on inputs but not on selects?\
[09:59:50] <decx> required is an attribute
[10:00:38] <randomguy> garethdaine: is it intended for the final else of the progress bar li click to use 0.8 in the scale rather than 1 like the top?  it seems when the issue occurs the scale is 0.8 rather than 1
[10:02:49] <shwaiil> ok so I'm tempted about changing the css transition animation (triggered by classname), and use animate() and for each step trigger the window resize.UID
[10:03:01] <shwaiil> but this sounds like a really bad practice and probably extremely slow
[10:03:08] <shwaiil> I mean.. I could throttle
[10:03:14] <shwaiil> humm
[10:21:51] <AlluringMe> Hi
[10:21:56] <Seldon> hi
[10:22:20] <AlluringMe> I am just doing  $( txt1 ).insertAfter( "#ui-state-default" );
[10:22:46] <AlluringMe> for a li item and it does not seem to work; I want it by the side/next to it
[10:22:55] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ AlluringMe
[10:22:56] <b-ot> AlluringMe: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:23:56] <AlluringMe> Hi robertmaxrees , this: http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/3/
[10:24:12] <AlluringMe> I studied what you told me yesterday and improved code
[10:24:35] <robertmaxrees> so which line here are you stuck on?
[10:24:48] <AlluringMe> b-ot, thanks, I will start using it going forward
[10:24:58] <robertmaxrees> lol AlluringMe that's a bot.
[10:25:04] <robertmaxrees> i told it to shoot you those links.
[10:25:14] <AlluringMe> Haha, okay, I did not know lol
[10:25:26] <AlluringMe> This one please: $( txt1 ).insertAfter( "#ui-state-default" );
[10:25:40] <robertmaxrees> i don't see that line anywhere in your code.
[10:25:55] <AlluringMe> Hmm sec, update as you told me yester
[10:25:56] <robertmaxrees> fwiw, # is for IDs.
[10:26:03] <robertmaxrees> you probably want .
[10:26:16] <robertmaxrees> but I don't see  $( txt1 ).insertAfter( "#ui-state-default" ); anywhere in the code you just shared.
[10:26:21] <AlluringMe> http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/5/
[10:26:33] <AlluringMe> This one please
[10:26:35] <robertmaxrees> ah.
[10:26:37] <robertmaxrees> a few problems.
[10:26:39] <AlluringMe> It works with body
[10:26:54] <robertmaxrees> right, your selector is for an element with that ID.
[10:26:59] <AlluringMe> but not after a <li> element
[10:26:59] <robertmaxrees> you want .ui-state-default instead.
[10:27:14] <AlluringMe> Hmm, lemme try I guess i did try that
[10:27:17] <robertmaxrees> but that's still bad because that's not valid.
[10:27:28] <AlluringMe> Why is that please?
[10:27:34] <randomguy> side by side? http://jsfiddle.net/ju3x167q/6/
[10:27:39] <robertmaxrees> only <li> can be a child of <ul>
[10:27:50] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to append a textarea as a child of the <ul>
[10:27:58] <robertmaxrees> you should append it to the <li> instead.
[10:28:28] <AlluringMe> Okay, how does append help? Both of them manipulate DOM
[10:28:39] <AlluringMe> why is append() better
[10:28:41] <robertmaxrees> you need to append to the <li>
[10:28:46] <robertmaxrees> not insterAfter the li.
[10:28:51] <robertmaxrees> *insertAfter
[10:29:15] <AlluringMe> Okay, I will just try that. sec.
[10:29:26] <robertmaxrees> what you're doing now is basically doing <ul><li></li><textarea></textarea></ul> - this is not valid.
[10:29:40] <robertmaxrees> only LI elements can be direct descendents of <ul>
[10:30:31] <AlluringMe> Hmmm, dorky HTML is what I am building then haha
[10:31:01] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ju3x167q/7/ is the start.
[10:31:09] <robertmaxrees> you have some styling and markup to clean up.
[10:31:37] <AlluringMe> Sir, I tried this
[10:31:41] <AlluringMe> but this looks bad
[10:31:52] <robertmaxrees> right. you need to clean up your html.
[10:31:54] <AlluringMe> CSS play then?
[10:32:13] <AlluringMe> Okay, I must clean HTML
[10:32:21] <robertmaxrees> and your CSS>
[10:32:42] <AlluringMe> I must figure out a way to do this.
[10:32:58] <AlluringMe> I will try and seek help again. Thank you very much.
[10:33:11] <AlluringMe> @robertmaxrees,
[10:37:40] <DragonPunch> is there a jQuery way to count children?
[10:37:48] <robertmaxrees> .children().length
[10:37:58] <DragonPunch> hmm okay.
[10:38:12] <robertmaxrees> that's direct descendents.
[10:38:28] <DragonPunch> i believe that's all i need.
[10:43:16] <abishek> how can I validate on keydown numeric values only on a text input?
[10:43:38] <robertmaxrees> bind an event listener and try to parseFloat() or parseInt() the .val() of the input.
[10:48:30] <DaFiN> hey can somebody tell me quickly
[10:48:50] <DaFiN> name for this, http://www.oracle.com/ that slideshow?
[10:49:12] <robertmaxrees> that's a carouself?
[10:49:15] <robertmaxrees> *carousel
[10:49:18] <robertmaxrees> not sure what you mean
[10:49:20] <DaFiN> alright thanks
[10:49:24] <DaFiN> i wanted to know whats it called
[10:57:14] <Zeranoe> When preforming a drag out of an "overflow: auto" div, the element jumps down when the scroll bar has been moved. I'm assuming this is because the parent element has it's overflow changed to overflow:visible when onmousedown. I'm able to drag the element outside the div with the help of "appedTo" and "helper", but I cannot figure out how to keep the element from jumping down.
[10:58:46] <tasaif> Are you using draggable or did you try to roll your own?
[10:59:42] <Zeranoe> tasaif: using draggable
[10:59:57] <decx> that oracle site with js off. http://i.imgur.com/YoMTZXp.png progressive enhancement!
[11:00:07] <tasaif> Can you put your problem in a fiddle?
[11:00:27] <Zeranoe> tasaif: I guess, it's pretty complicated so it might take a while
[11:01:03] <tasaif> ok, but I would hate for you to put in that effort and then no one is able to find a solution
[11:03:05] <BillCriswell> Zeranoe: with touch events?
[11:03:37] <Zeranoe> BillCriswell: Not sure what you mean
[11:04:23] <BillCriswell> I was just trying to figure out if I could tell the difference between a drag and a scroll event (touch screen) and your situation sounded similar.
[11:05:30] <BillCriswell> Zeranoe: If you set a height on the elements with scroll bars I think you should be ok?
[11:11:39] <Zeranoe> When doing a helper :'clone', is there a way to hide the original element so that it doesn't actually look like it was duplicated but instead dragged
[11:12:54] <abishek> robertmaxrees, can you give me an example, I need to restrict the user from entering alphabets and only numberic or floats
[11:13:05] <robertmaxrees> setup the fiddle ;)
[11:15:24] <grodt> hi, is there a way to have a button toggle a div showing/hiding but able to close the div if you click anywhere outside the div including the button itself which toggles?
[11:15:37] <robertmaxrees> sounds like a modal.
[11:17:30] <Zeranoe> tasaif: I got it. Bascially, jQuery is awesome.
[11:18:19] <tasaif> most excellent
[11:18:51] <BillCriswell> Zeranoe: Hide it on start drag.
[11:18:55] <testerbit> When using this function to open another modal after the first, the iframe still displays the previous PDF, how can I clear the iframe prior to loading the next PDF?: http://pastebin.com/Wa95XZV2
[11:19:26] <robertmaxrees> delete the src.
[11:19:40] <robertmaxrees> .prop('src', '');
[11:19:43] <BillCriswell> Zeranoe: $('.draggable').on({start: function (event, ui) { ui.draggable.hide(); }, stop: function (event, ui) { ui.draggable.show(); }); etc.
[11:19:44] <robertmaxrees> then set it with the new value.
[11:19:51] <grodt> robertmaxrees, like a modal but not using modal
[11:19:55] <grodt> f this client
[11:20:03] <decx> why would deleting it be different from changing the src?
[11:20:18] <robertmaxrees> decx so the iframe doesn't show anything before the new one loads?
[11:20:30] <decx> or prior to loading
[11:20:34] <decx> gotcha
[11:20:38] <decx> oh*
[11:20:38] <robertmaxrees> (shrug) sure.
[11:21:26] <testerbit> robertmaxress: but that in before the src with url?
[11:21:29] <testerbit> put
[11:21:35] <robertmaxrees> sure.  give it a shot.
[11:21:50] <testerbit> k
[11:22:07] <decx> killing the content will be double jarring imho
[11:22:21] <decx> one sudden change to empty and another when it's loaded
[11:22:30] <decx> instead of just one change
[11:25:47] <testerbit> robertmaxrees: I tried this, but problem seems to persist, http://pastebin.com/AnCZ1dt3
[11:26:26] <baako> i see something like this works for everyone http://jsfiddle.net/baako/jdowghkz/but not for me? what i am trying to do is hide this label
[11:27:11] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jdowghkz/1/ baako
[11:27:36] <robertmaxrees> testerbit no clue man.  you might need to kill of the iframe entirely and make a new one each time.
[11:28:07] <testerbit> on close?
[11:28:27] <baako> robertmaxrees: cheers i added an extra bracket
[11:28:40] <robertmaxrees> baako yeah, you just needed to remove the extra paren
[11:28:47] <robertmaxrees> testerbit sure.  play around with it.
[11:31:42] <testerbit> if <div class="modal-header">, how would I traverse to a child button that is class=close?
[11:32:08] <robertmaxrees> .find('.close')
[11:32:21] <robertmaxrees> or $('.modal-header .close');
[11:33:46] <testerbit> robertmaxress: $('.modal-header').find('.close', function(event){...?
[11:33:49] <kingfisher64> could some kind soul point me to a script to apply an autoheight on an iframe? I don't have control over the content from the iframe.
[11:33:59] <robertmaxrees> testerbit huh?
[11:34:00] <baako> robertmaxrees: $(this).find('label').delay(800 ).hide();
[11:34:07] <baako> why doesnt it delay?
[11:34:16] <robertmaxrees> .delay() only works on animation queues.
[11:34:22] <BillCriswell> baako: It's not queue
[11:34:23] <baako> okay
[11:34:27] <robertmaxrees> you need a timeout
[11:34:45] <robertmaxrees> kingfisher64 you might not be able to depending on CORS.
[11:34:50] <robertmaxrees> testerbit what are you trying to do?
[11:34:55] <robertmaxrees> because that code makes no sense.
[11:35:08] <testerbit> remove the iframe on close of the modal
[11:35:10] <BillCriswell> kingfisher64: You're in for a bad time.
[11:38:26] <baako> robertmaxrees:  setTimeout( "jQuery(this).find('label').hide();",3000 );
[11:38:49] <arthurvr> ‘Allo guys!
[11:39:54] <robertmaxrees> baako ... no
[11:40:13] <robertmaxrees>  setTimeout( function() {jQuery(this).find('label').hide()},3000 );
[11:40:20] <kingfisher64> okay, so it's not recommended through jquery BillCriswell, robertmaxrees
[11:40:20] <robertmaxrees> but your 'this' won't be what you think it is.
[11:40:31] <robertmaxrees> you need to var $this = $(this); and then use $this there.
[11:41:11] <kingfisher64> http://www.benmarshall.me/responsive-iframes/ through css it what i'll give a go. It sounded quite complicated and I thought a jquery equilivant might be easier...
[11:41:12] <BillCriswell> kingfisher64: It's not really a jQuery issue, it's a security concern as far as I understand it.
[11:41:49] <robertmaxrees> kingfisher64 yeah, this is a security issue.
[11:41:53] <BillCriswell> kingfisher64: I imagine this content is on the same domain, which isn't an issue, it's when it's an external domain.
[11:42:11] <robertmaxrees> unless you have access to the iframes contents - is it on the same port, protocol, and domain?
[11:42:25] <tasaif> I don't know what you guys are talking about but it might be the same reason why you can't ajax from another server
[11:42:46] <decx> good old padding-bottom % hack
[11:43:04] <robertmaxrees> tasaif lol you CAN get ajax from another server, but that's also apart of CORS.
[11:43:08] <robertmaxrees> it's not supported by default.
[11:43:17] <tasaif> right
[11:43:24] <robertmaxrees> but yes, similar security concept.
[11:43:53] <baako> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/baako/jdowghkz/3/ still nothing
[11:44:02] <robertmaxrees> ...
[11:44:08] <robertmaxrees> did you not read the last thing I said, baako?
[11:44:32] <kingfisher64> it sounds like i'm walking into a mine field
[11:44:33] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/jdowghkz/4/
[11:44:52] <robertmaxrees> kingfisher64 iframes are clunky and awkward - stuff like this is partially why i avoid them.
[11:45:03] <kingfisher64> what would you guys do then?
[11:45:22] <robertmaxrees> is the iframe source on the same domain as the page you're showing it on?
[11:45:35] <decx> to expand on the issue here: setTimeout is attached to window and as such this inside the function will just be window
[11:45:46] <kingfisher64> no robertmaxrees
[11:45:59] <baako> robertmaxrees: i did and i added var $this and still samr result
[11:46:09] <tasaif> var does nothing
[11:46:15] <robertmaxrees> baako look at what i gave you.
[11:46:21] <robertmaxrees> you misunderstood what i mean.
[11:46:22] <robertmaxrees> *meant
[11:46:31] <robertmaxrees> kingfisher64 i'd just hard-set a height and call it a day.,
[11:58:44] <testerbit> When I click close the modal says open, how can I have it close the modal in addition to the action?: http://pastebin.com/B0QUF8hi
[11:58:54] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[12:04:29] <Zeranoe> Can the width of a dragged item be set somehow?
[12:06:16] <BillCriswell> Zeranoe: CSS.
[12:06:48] <BillCriswell> Zeranoe: Look right above the closing </body> when you start dragging and you'll see the clone and the classes on it.
[12:11:52] <MrStar> guys - does anyone have an idea why my jquery ui button (based on input type="checkbox") does not work? http://divstar.no-ip.org/
[12:12:42] <AoiC> it does not remain "pressed" when clicked.. but if I use just raw html <input>-element, I can check and uncheck just fine
[12:13:45] <decx> what kind of pattern is that anyway?
[12:13:57] <decx> dropdown bigass button range pattern?!
[12:14:06] <AoiC> I didn't yet style the button
[12:14:23] <AoiC> I plan on making it a lot smaller once it actually works
[12:14:48] <decx> with pattern i mean ux element concept
[12:15:02] <AoiC> basically: if a user wants to filter a datatable using count, he drops it down, enables it and sets the range :x
[12:15:10] <decx> a dropdown with a button and a range
[12:15:23] <decx> it's not exactly clear
[12:15:24] <AoiC> I made that dropdown-thing on my own
[12:16:08] <decx> users have a hard time figuring out concepts that are not explicit
[12:16:08] <AoiC> the problem is, that I have only one small header to show the information, but I have plenty of space in a dropdown
[12:16:23] <decx> only having the range will suffice
[12:16:50] <AoiC> and how do I go about resetting the range?
[12:17:04] <AoiC> like if the user does not want to filter by this range after all?
[12:17:41] <AoiC> http://serenity-eye.com/irongb/ <- this is the "parent" application if you will :)
[12:18:16] <decx> and the range thing on the count column?
[12:18:34] <AoiC> yeah that's where it is supposed to go once it works
[12:18:49] <AoiC> (I did not finish that control, because the button does not work - hence it's not yet there)
[12:25:00] <decx> there's a lot of stuff going on there
[12:26:13] <AoiC> hm yeah that's why I posted the first link first
[12:28:48] <Biganon> Hi ! Is it possible to change the order of elements in the DOM ? I'm very new to this
[12:31:44] <AoiC> Biganon - have a look at this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1363650/javascript-moving-element-in-the-dom I am not sure if moving is possible, but detaching and reattaching is possible
[12:33:08] <Biganon> because here is my problem : I have a JSON object that represents a few objects ; I need to display them, let the user change them a bit, reorder them, and at the end I need to get the JSON of the modified objects
[12:33:16] <Biganon> like a "snapshot" if you will
[12:34:07] <Biganon> your SO link will probably be useful thanks
[12:35:21] <AoiC> hm again I am not too sure, but why not have your JSON objects contain an "index" attribute and simply change that as the user re-orders
[12:35:42] <AoiC> if you did that, you could pass that attribute to your server later on and it would get the information and perhaps sort by index
[12:38:37] <Biganon> yeah it's a pretty good idea
[12:38:46] <decx> having a separate index in your json is definitely the way to go here
[12:38:52] <decx> instead of rebuilding the whole thing
[12:39:07] <AoiC> yeah should be faster, too - and much less of a hassle
[12:39:45] <AoiC> plus sorting by property is easy on the server-side (using .net / LINQ or java - not sure about php, but I guess there's an easy way for that, too)
[12:40:49] <Biganon> python and a key to sorted
[12:41:20] <AoiC> ah .. sorry I am not familiar with python D: .. have been programming in java and .net as well as php for quite some years now though
[12:51:58] <logikos> in a document there is a class I want to target, the class could be on form fields such as input, select, textarea, etc or it could be on elements containing those elements.  I want to select all form elements such as input, select, textarea, etc which have the class or are a descendent of an element which has the class
[12:52:39] <logikos> must i do 'input.someclass, select.someclass, textarea.someclass, .someclass input, .someclass select, .someclass textarea ....
[12:52:45] <logikos> or is there some better way?
[12:52:57] <tasaif> why don't you just do .someclass?
[12:53:10] <logikos> because i'm toggling if it is disabled or not
[12:53:25] <logikos> and if i have a <div class=someclass><input type=text ....
[12:53:29] <logikos> i need to toggle the input
[12:53:31] <logikos> not the div
[12:54:22] <robertmaxrees> .someclass, .someclass :input might work
[12:55:08] <logikos> it would attempt to toggle the disabled property of a div
[12:55:21] <logikos> which cant have the property
[12:56:00] <tasaif> can you structure the html in a fiddle
[12:56:00] <tasaif> ?
[12:56:10] <tasaif> then describe what you want to do?
[12:58:14] <logikos> sure
[12:58:15] <logikos> sec
[13:00:27] <tasaif> so did DroogonPunch stop acting weird yesterday?
[13:04:07] <robertmaxrees> let's let yesterday be yesterday ;)
[13:04:15] <logikos> tasaif: http://jsfiddle.net/07efnjaw/1/
[13:04:29] <logikos> that is a simplistic example
[13:04:36] <logikos> although ugly
[13:04:49] <logikos> but if i have to build that long selecter string so be it, just figured there was some better way
[13:05:48] <robertmaxrees> :input.t, .t :input
[13:05:52] <robertmaxrees> why not try this?
[13:06:41] <robertmaxrees> that should function identically to the above.
[13:07:18] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/07efnjaw/2/ yep.
[13:07:41] <logikos> yes, it does apear to, tyvm
[13:07:46] <logikos> should work
[13:10:29] <tasaif> I didn't know about the :input pseudo selector
[13:10:41] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/input-selector/
[13:10:52] <robertmaxrees> it's a jquery extension.  can be slow.
[13:10:54] <logikos> me neither
[13:10:56] <tasaif> you're going to laugh at my solution (blush)
[13:11:28] <logikos> cant be worse than mine?
[13:11:58] <robertmaxrees> it'd be a little faster to use .filter(), but meh.
[13:12:35] <logikos> show me
[13:13:10] <logikos> filter would only work for :input.t ? not .t input ?
[13:13:15] <logikos> unless i'm missing something
[13:14:02] <robertmaxrees> you'd have to have a collection of elements first.
[13:14:24] <robertmaxrees> the smartest way to do this would be to just cache the inputs into an object and call it a day.
[13:14:29] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/07efnjaw/5/
[13:14:53] <robertmaxrees> var $allInputs = $(':input.t, .t :input');
[13:15:12] <robertmaxrees> holy globals.
[13:15:17] <logikos> yeah i'm doing that, beings i want to use them elsewhere
[13:15:37] <robertmaxrees> doing whatnot?
[13:15:39] <robertmaxrees> *whatnow
[13:15:43] <tasaif> declaring variables is for plebs
[13:15:52] <robertmaxrees> or people who like to write valid js ;)
[13:16:35] <tasaif> http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/07efnjaw/6/
[13:16:37] <tasaif> coffeescript
[13:16:42] <tasaif> language of the gods
[13:17:08] <robertmaxrees> or just http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/07efnjaw/7/
[13:18:18] <tasaif> if you're not careful, you're going to be writing fortran in a word of higher order languages
[13:18:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:18:45] <tasaif> world*
[13:19:00] <robertmaxrees> again: huh?
[13:19:05] <tasaif> slippery slope argument
[13:19:13] <robertmaxrees> except i'm just writing javascript.
[13:19:16] <robertmaxrees> sooo.
[13:19:19] <tasaif> for why coffeescript is better than js
[13:20:03] <robertmaxrees> too bad most of the people in here don't use it.
[13:20:09] <robertmaxrees> not the right audience and all that ;)
[13:21:00] <tasaif> ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ a man can dream
[13:21:15] <robertmaxrees> until then, let's give good, relevant, solid code advice :)
[13:22:02] <cjohnson> go to ##javascript and ask Sorella why coffeescript is the language of the gods
[13:22:08] <robertmaxrees> hahahahaha
[13:22:08] <cjohnson> ;P
[13:22:16] <robertmaxrees> that'd be a thing to watch.
[13:22:46] <logikos> robertmaxrees: ty for your help, this is what I ended up with, i wanted to enable/disable the fields based on a checkbox - http://jsfiddle.net/dov55c92/1/
[13:22:57] <tasaif> http://disgruntled.agreement.jpg.to
[13:23:03] <tasaif> you wait, the future is comin' marty
[13:23:15] <robertmaxrees> except that more and more people are abandoning coffeescript ;)_
[13:23:50] <tasaif> heresay
[13:23:58] <robertmaxrees> oh okay.
[13:23:58] <tasaif> hearsay*
[13:23:59] <AoiC> so uhm.. I hate to say this.. but does someone know why a jquery ui button does not work properly with a checkbox-type input :x?
[13:24:18] <tasaif> robertmaxrees: http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=coffeescript
[13:25:01] <[Non]> is there anybody knows how to handle moment js?
[13:25:08] <robertmaxrees> doesn't really change my point here either way, tasaif
[13:25:20] <[Non]> moment().add(i, 'days').calendar()
[13:25:22] <[Non]> this gives me
[13:25:25] <[Non]> Tomorrow 22:00
[13:25:34] <[Non]> Today at 19:20 pm
[13:25:34] <robertmaxrees> the majority of people in this channel aren't using it, soooo
[13:25:43] <[Non]> but i want to do this -> 14.3.2015
[13:25:47] <[Non]> Or only Day Names
[13:25:51] <[Non]> how can i accomplish that in my code?
[13:26:25] <cjohnson> the format method
[13:26:31] <robertmaxrees> momentjs.com#format-dates [Non]
[13:26:45] <[Non]> but where can i put that method?
[13:26:49] <[Non]> i tired
[13:26:50] <[Non]> tried*
[13:26:56] <tasaif> AoiC: put it in a fiddle so I can fiddle with it?
[13:26:58] <[Non]> moment().format(blahblah).add
[13:27:00] <cjohnson> at the end. I think instead of calendar
[13:27:00] <[Non]> but doesnt work for me
[13:27:04] <[Non]> hmm
[13:27:05] <cjohnson> format is a last step
[13:27:13] <cjohnson> you operate on date and then you format into string
[13:27:50] <[Non]> yeah god damn finally
[13:27:51] <[Non]> :D
[13:29:39] <AoiC> http://jsfiddle.net/xhbnu54s/ :x this is my problem .. sorry to barge-in like that T_T
[13:29:47] <robertmaxrees> that's what we're here for.
[13:30:20] <AoiC> if I use pure html in the html part and do .button() on it - it works.. but if I add the button dynamically - it does not work for whatever reason
[13:30:38] <robertmaxrees> you need a single root element in that fragment btw
[13:31:06] <AoiC> ahh.. so appending input and label at once will not work - so I should append it separately?
[13:31:24] <robertmaxrees> append them and then call the .button() method maybe?
[13:31:26] <robertmaxrees> give that a shot.
[13:31:37] <AoiC> I will try! thank you
[13:35:08] <tasaif> who is Sorella?
[13:35:20] <robertmaxrees> she hangs out in ##javascript
[13:35:25] <robertmaxrees> and has some very strong opinions.
[13:35:34] <AoiC> ah just a side-note: http://jsfiddle.net/xhbnu54s/2/ works! so doing it the way you suggested, robert, works
[13:35:42] <robertmaxrees> awesome.
[13:36:13] <decx> why do you create inputs anyway?
[13:36:23] <AoiC> because jquery ui button does need it
[13:36:31] <AoiC> I want a toggle button
[13:36:37] <decx> i mean why not have that in the html
[13:36:41] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:36:52] <robertmaxrees> why create it using JS instead of having it in the markup.
[13:37:17] <AoiC> because it will be created in the table-footer, which in-turn is formatted using jquery datatables
[13:37:34] <decx> fair enough
[13:39:34] <AoiC> anyway thank you guys!
[13:41:26] <irontiga> hey, help?! Is this valid jquery? http://pastebin.com/YqsDUKSE
[13:42:06] <decx> $(this.attr('id')) isn't anything
[13:42:19] <robertmaxrees> same with  this.attr('id')
[13:42:25] <robertmaxrees> also, that'll cause invalid html.
[13:42:39] <irontiga> <a id='one' class='tabber'>
[13:42:45] <irontiga> how do i get the id?
[13:42:50] <robertmaxrees> you can't have multiple elements with the same ID.
[13:43:00] <irontiga> yeah....
[13:43:06] <irontiga> i know i think
[13:43:11] <irontiga> yyeah, i did know that
[13:43:22] <irontiga> but i am trying to use a simgle class
[13:43:27] <irontiga> for multiple links
[13:43:52] <irontiga> and then to make them divs when their link is clicked..based on the link's id
[13:43:55] <AoiC> to get the indices of all the times, just select by class
[13:44:04] <AoiC> of all the anchors I mean
[13:44:12] <irontiga> sorry, don't understand
[13:44:16] <robertmaxrees> to get an element's ID attribute, you'd need to use $(this).attr('id')
[13:44:20] <robertmaxrees> or this.id
[13:44:27] <irontiga> i'll use this.id
[13:44:37] <decx> but if you click a .tabber multiple times it'll create new containers with the same id again and again
[13:44:41] <robertmaxrees> but $("#tabContent").append("<div id='" + $(this).attr('id') + "' class='tab-pane fade'><br><Br><br><Br><br>Heya guys i really hope this works</div>"); is no good
[13:44:54] <robertmaxrees> because the id already existys in the thing you clicked.
[13:45:09] <irontiga> ahh
[13:45:13] <irontiga> okay, i get it now
[13:45:32] <robertmaxrees> this will all effect your attempt to do $('#' + this.attr('id')).tab('show'); fwiw.
[13:45:38] <robertmaxrees> becuase that will never select what you think it will.
[13:47:20] <irontiga> jQuery(function($){
[13:47:21] <irontiga> oops
[13:47:48] <irontiga> http://pastebin.com/34RTucEH
[13:48:08] <robertmaxrees> that'll still cause duplicate IDs.
[13:48:19] <robertmaxrees> and it'd be $('#' + newid).tab('show');
[13:49:15] <irontiga> okay, soo...i think if i had 2 classes...one which creates the tab....and then is immediately removed...and then the other which remains and shws the tab?
[13:49:37] <robertmaxrees> what are you actually trying to do here?
[13:50:18] <decx> how is the content delivered?
[13:50:33] <robertmaxrees> i just don't get why you're doing this client-side.
[13:51:07] <irontiga> i want to load the content remotely
[13:51:13] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[13:51:15] <irontiga> and have a back button
[13:51:21] <irontiga> i am good with php
[13:51:37] <irontiga> so i will load the div's contents via php
[13:51:41] <decx> so you have an endpoint that sends you tab content
[13:51:44] <irontiga> and have the back button done in js
[13:51:53] <robertmaxrees> what'
[13:52:00] <robertmaxrees> *what's with the tabcontrol stuff then?
[13:52:00] <decx> it's pretty involved
[13:52:05] <decx> keeping state
[13:52:27] <robertmaxrees> ^ managing the back button is painful business.
[13:53:10] <irontiga> the tabs
[13:53:20] <irontiga> i create a new tab to go to the next page
[13:53:25] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:53:30] <irontiga> and then back button just retruns to the previous tab
[13:53:34] <robertmaxrees> noooo
[13:53:36] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[13:53:53] <irontiga> leeme show you what i've got
[13:54:23] <decx> http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-bbq/examples/fragment-jquery-ui-tabs/
[13:55:01] <lng> Hi! How to send JS object via .ajax?
[13:55:27] <irontiga> decx, i have already got tabs like that
[13:55:37] <robertmaxrees> lng the data propery.
[13:55:42] <robertmaxrees> data: myObject,
[13:55:45] <decx> it's not about the tabs irontiga
[13:56:00] <decx> click around and use back&forward
[13:56:20] <irontiga> and i have got a thing going to update the url based on selected tab
[13:56:25] <lng> robertmaxrees: what should I use for dataType?
[13:56:31] <robertmaxrees> nothing.
[13:56:38] <robertmaxrees> leave that alone unless you need to play with it.
[13:57:07] <irontiga> okay, so...that pliugin adds a back button for me.....
[13:57:14] <lng> robertmaxrees: I got nasty error: TypeError: this is undefined
[13:57:23] <robertmaxrees> show me your code.
[13:58:00] <irontiga> ahh, no, i don't want to use the browser back button....i want to add my own back button
[13:59:14] <irontiga> okay, so, i am building something similiar to: http://burstcoin.eu/
[13:59:23] <lng> robertmaxrees: http://pastebin.com/hy6Dz7AD
[13:59:36] <irontiga> so, if you click a link n there, it takes you to a new page
[13:59:57] <robertmaxrees> lng what line is it erroring on for you?
[14:00:01] <irontiga> i want to add in a back button to mine, and load pages via js, while updating the url hash
[14:00:03] <lng> robertmaxrees: I can log result
[14:00:21] <lng> main.js:31:430
[14:00:26] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:00:28] <robertmaxrees> can or can't?
[14:00:56] <robertmaxrees> i don't understand where your problem is lol
[14:01:03] <lng> robertmaxrees: me too
[14:01:22] <robertmaxrees> so what line in this code are you getting the error on?
[14:01:38] <lng> robertmaxrees: from the lib
[14:01:48] <robertmaxrees> check the stack trace.
[14:02:44] <robertmaxrees> also i'm not seeing where you've loaded jquery in that pastebin.
[14:06:52] <Zeranoe> Can I force a function/command if the user hits the back button?
[14:08:19] <markholmes_> Zeranoe, yes
[14:08:24] <AoiC> I suppose this is what you might be after: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/25806608/how-to-detect-browser-back-button-event-cross-browser
[14:08:32] <Zeranoe> markholmes_: Any example, clues for me?
[14:08:35] <spookah> If I know an item id will start with ig_ and end with _name but the middle portion will be a variable length alpha characters.. is there anyway to select that?
[14:08:51] <AoiC> yes spookah
[14:09:27] <AoiC> $('[name^="beginsWith"]') for example selects everything, that has a name attribute that starts with "beginsWith"
[14:09:48] <markholmes_> spookah, http://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/#attribute-substrings
[14:11:06] <spookah> perfect, thank you!
[14:11:22] <markholmes_> so div[class^="ig_"][class$="_name"]
[14:11:37] <AoiC> hm is there a way to select something in the middle?
[14:11:44] <AoiC> or make a regex selection?
[14:12:43] <AoiC> ah .. *= probably for content in the middle it seems..
[14:12:49] <jfive> http://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/ <-- full list there
[14:13:11] <jfive> Attribute Contains Word Selector [name~="value"]
[14:13:22] <AoiC> ah great - thank you jfive!
[14:13:57] <AoiC> ah .. but this is a jquery selector - or a css one, too? I know ^= and $= css selectors
[14:14:31] <markholmes_> same thing
[14:20:33] <robertmaxrees> not the same thing, but similar.
[14:21:23] <AoiC> yeah I thought jquery had some additional selectors
[14:21:28] <robertmaxrees> it does.
[14:21:34] <tasaif> always arguing semantics
[14:21:46] <robertmaxrees> it includes all of CSS plus some.
[14:22:14] <decx> there are the standard selectors and expressions
[14:22:22] <decx> those are basicly filter() for selectos
[14:24:34] <AoiC> hm I wish I could create a jquery ui toggle-button (based on checkbox) without an id..
[14:24:46] <AoiC> but it seems I have to specify one due to the label's "for" attribute
[14:25:22] <decx> the ui toggle button is just a confusing checkbox replacement
[14:26:04] <AoiC> yeah, but it's handy.. on the other hand I could just use toggleClass I suppose and switch classes.. but if I am already using jquery ui.. I could very well just use that jquery ui button if it's possible
[14:26:06] <decx> i know white bg means pressed but it's no checkmark
[14:26:22] <robertmaxrees> but you don'
[14:26:28] <robertmaxrees> *don't want to use jquery ui, AoiC ;)
[14:26:35] <robertmaxrees> you want to kind of use it.
[14:26:36] <AoiC> I don't want to
[14:26:50] <AoiC> but it's terribly handy for some stuff :x
[14:26:54] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[14:29:30] <AoiC> ah right I use it for the datepicker
[14:29:36] <AoiC> and its time-version (datetimepicker)
[14:31:04] <AoiC> and apparently I am using the tooltip widget, too
[14:31:26] <AoiC> robertmaxrees do you think I should try and replace those and not use jquery ui at all?
[14:42:34] <Biganon> if my content gets appended dynamically by jQuery, is there a way to view the source ?
[14:42:42] <Biganon> because it doesn't reflect the changes, and it makes it hard to debug
[14:43:01] <Cork> Biganon: use the browsers inspector
[14:43:11] <Cork> it is based on the dom instead of the source
[14:43:20] <Biganon> oh yeah good idea thx
[14:44:06] <bigstylee> web developer toolbar for firefox has an option to "view generated source" too
[14:44:38] <AoiC> yeah (I think it's firebug there?) and console output as well as breakpoints + debugging mechanisms with current values and scopes :)
[14:54:06] <devslash> is anyone familiar with this jQuery plugin ? http://www.jacklmoore.com/colorbox/
[14:55:47] <devslash> That link shows you all the settings you can configure for the plugin. What I want to do is set the width and height to fit to the contents exactly when a page opens up in an iframe but width:"auto" doesn't work. the width becomes 1 pixel wide
[14:56:31] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:56:44] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ devslash
[14:56:44] <b-ot> devslash: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[14:56:51] <devslash> cant
[14:56:58] <devslash> its internal code that I am not allowed to release
[14:57:02] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[14:57:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:57:10] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[14:57:37] <devslash> when you click on a link, it opens up in an iframe using colorbox. I just want to know if its possible to have an iframe adjust the size automaticalyl to fit the contents for the width and height
[14:57:51] <devslash> I want the iframe to fit the width and height
[14:57:53] <robertmaxrees> aaaah, in that case, it's a "maybe"
[14:57:56] <jwmann> I'm using jQuery to make an AJAX call to through Wordpress which add certain data into woocommerce's meta data system. However I'm wondering if there a way I can put a checksum or something so that someone can't malicously inject meta data into my system by hijacking my AJAX call… Is that possible to do?
[14:58:14] <robertmaxrees> is the iframe source on the same domain as where you're opening it, devslash
[14:58:22] <devslash> yea
[14:58:46] <robertmaxrees> jwmann if it's client-side, it can be hijacked.
[14:58:49] <devslash> IIRC you cant do cross domain iframes can you ?
[14:58:50] <robertmaxrees> sanitize all input.
[14:59:06] <robertmaxrees> you can, devslash but that's irrelevant right now :)
[14:59:31] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to read up on how to get the height/width of the contents of an iframe and then apply that manually.
[14:59:44] <robertmaxrees> the issue here is that you'll have to find a way to load the iframe without displaying it.
[14:59:48] <jwmann> robertmaxrees: Yes, I'm trying to apply something server side which will deny anything malicious
[15:00:03] <robertmaxrees> jwmann that's doable.  lots of options.
[15:00:12] <robertmaxrees> depending on the language/framework/etc.
[15:00:26] <jwmann> Anything other than sanitization that I can do? I'm using a wordpress action function as an AJAX callback.
[15:00:49] <robertmaxrees> not really.  sanitize server-side.  that's about it.
[15:00:58] <robertmaxrees> or reject bad requests. either/or.
[15:01:12] <jwmann> AH okay, gotcha
[15:17:04] <Jung3o> hi guys. I'm having trouble displaying notifications 1 at a time http://jsfiddle.net/jung3o/y4vvocrg/
[15:17:11] <Jung3o> What am I doing wrong here?
[15:18:14] <decx> your timeouts all start at roughly the same time
[15:18:49] <Jung3o> well the problem is that they're all appearing at the same time no matter the timeout
[15:24:50] <StanAccy> Do jquery objects have any sort of unique identifier? If so, how can I access it
[15:25:06] <StanAccy> mem address or hashcode or..
[15:25:47] <Cork> StanAccy: what object are you referring to?
[15:25:52] <robertmaxrees> WAT
[15:26:06] <Dorf> is it possible to generate something and then place it inside another script tag?
[15:26:08] <robertmaxrees> StanAccy not really.  you need to store those references yourself and handle them from there.
[15:26:17] <StanAccy> Im trying to debug some event handlers, and Id liket o dump out in the logs an identifier for the event object
[15:26:29] <StanAccy> robertmaxrees: Happy to store them - I just want to id them :-)
[15:26:51] <robertmaxrees> O.o jsut use your developer tools to handle all that.  you can get all the info you need.
[15:27:00] <StanAccy> no, I need them in the log
[15:27:09] <d10n-work> what's the best way to walk an entire dom tree?
[15:27:10] <decx> Jung3o oh now i see, your margin on the first element affects all the others
[15:27:16] <Dorf> for example $("script.receiver").html("some more js");
[15:27:16] <Jung3o> OH
[15:27:30] <StanAccy> dev tools is taking way too long - I just want to print out some identifier (if available) and run through our scneario and then inspcet
[15:27:31] <Biganon> where can I put a $('.something').change(function... ?
[15:27:39] <Jung3o> @decx are you sure? i thought jquery animate is inline
[15:27:46] <StanAccy> Biganon: wherever you want
[15:27:48] <Biganon> if I just put it in <script></script> it doesn't work, in document.ready it doesn't work
[15:27:50] <decx> that's a css thing
[15:27:59] <Jung3o> i thought it was inline css
[15:28:02] <Biganon> I have to put it in the function that's called when the document is ready
[15:28:02] <Jung3o> why would it matter?
[15:28:17] <StanAccy> Biganon: define "doesnt work"
[15:28:33] <Biganon> ha I think I get why it didn't react
[15:28:39] <decx> Jung3o http://jsfiddle.net/decx/y4vvocrg/5/
[15:28:47] <decx> you cant explain that
[15:28:57] <decx> margin goes in margin goes out
[15:28:59] <Jung3o> yeah but jquery animate uses inline css to change
[15:29:01] <Biganon> StanAccy: I was subscribing an event to an element BEFORE its creation
[15:29:03] <Biganon> classic
[15:29:15] <decx> well i put inline css on the first element
[15:29:22] <decx> moving all the following elements
[15:29:23] <Jung3o> oh yeah you did
[15:29:25] <Jung3o> rip
[15:29:29] <Jung3o> thanks
[15:29:35] <StanAccy> Biganon: well, you were technically selecting elements before the one you wanted had been created
[15:32:51] <Jung3o> lmao why the hell is it changing every element with that 1 inline css
[15:40:32] <DragonPunch> i need... a really good overflow-y scrollbar...i can't find one...hey guys
[15:42:30] <Jung3o> @decx thanks! https://a.pomf.se/uxynep.mp4
[15:42:43] <Jung3o> ^ video of it working
[15:44:28] <robertmaxrees> DragonPunch good luck with that.
[15:45:20] <Velveeta> oy ve, i've been crash-coursing react for the last few days, and converting a series of handlebars backend templates + helpers to jsx components
[15:45:30] <robertmaxrees> how does it feel, Velveeta?
[15:46:01] <Velveeta> well.. it's definitely interesting, and i'm loving the component goodness, but this is for a poc demo due by end of month
[15:46:12] <Velveeta> and technically i haven't even started on the actual project yet
[15:47:00] <Velveeta> we have a scaffolding tool written in house, based on yeoman, which spits out an express project themed for our company branding, and including our sso authentication module, which i have to write this as a project generator for first
[15:47:21] <Velveeta> *then* once that's all debugged, i can commit it and blast away that directory and generate a fresh scaffold to use for this *actual* project
[15:47:58] <tasaif> robertmaxrees: do you mind if I pm you?
[15:48:09] <robertmaxrees> feel free i guess?
[15:48:16] <Velveeta> i'm still burning pto before it expires, every friday from middle of last month through the end of this one... i used today to get some catchup work done without meetings getting in the way
[15:53:10] <DragonPunch> turns out there is a jquery plugin for scrollbars.
[15:53:12] <DragonPunch> yay.
[15:54:58] <AoiC> uhm robert - I missed your reply - would you suggest I get a different datetimepicker and perhaps replace the tooltip widget and get rid of jquery ui?
[15:55:15] <tasaif> robertmaxrees
[15:55:32] <AoiC> ah .. forgot to "tab" :x sorry
[15:55:59] <tasaif> no worries
[16:01:12] <ravenzz> is it ok to .get(0).outerHTML ?
[16:02:36] <shoky_> yes, also .prop('outerHTML')
[16:02:59] <tasaif> what does .get(0) do?
[16:03:24] <shoky_> gets the first element in the collection, as a raw element
[16:03:31] <checkit> Hey guys, can anyone take a look a this little script and tell me how best to implement what I'm trying to do? https://gist.github.com/mrjonleek/ac381a40e5e20bd58d12
[16:03:34] <shoky_> `api get
[16:03:34] <b-ot> shoky_: .get(): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[16:03:51] <tasaif> shoky_: am I looking at the wrong thing? The doc says it's an ajax call
[16:04:19] <tasaif> I am, disregard
[16:04:20] <shoky_> tasaif: you're looking at $.get()  not $(...).get()
[16:06:01] <tasaif> checkit: your server should take you to the right place
[16:06:27] <tasaif> the way you're doing it now, you're not getting any feedback from the submit
[16:06:28] <checkit> Well, I need the form to submit but then go to the href attr.
[16:07:16] <tasaif> you should do it through ajax and handle the response properly
[16:07:21] <tasaif> you can overload the submit
[16:07:36] <checkit> What do you mean overload the submit?
[16:08:39] <checkit> Essentially I have a form wizard with a navigation "progress bar". The next at the bottom of the form submits. But, if a user clicks a link in the nav progress bar the form won't submit. That's what I'm trying to do.
[16:08:56] <tasaif> one sec, I'm fiddling
[16:11:18] <tasaif> checkit: http://jsfiddle.net/tasaif/0fyvshm0/
[16:11:24] <tasaif> here's half the picture
[16:13:27] <checkit> tasaif: Oh. Creative. I like it. Thanks bud.
[16:13:53] <tasaif> np
[17:24:16] <Biganon> I have a button that adds a new div, and in this div there's a link that's supposed to trigger something when clicked
[17:24:27] <robertmaxrees> event delegation
[17:24:34] <Biganon> how can I register the event to this newly created object ?
[17:24:47] <robertmaxrees> you don't.  use event delegation :)
[17:25:22] <Biganon> thanks !
[17:27:48] <Velveeta> huzzah for event delegation!
[17:31:02] <Biganon> works perfect
[17:31:13] <Biganon> is $(document).on() a bad idea ?
[17:31:34] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[17:31:36] <robertmaxrees> bind lower.
[17:32:45] <Biganon> mkay
[18:12:34] <elvis4526> What is the opposite of .hide()
[18:12:46] <elvis4526> I tried setting manually the visible property wht .css()
[18:12:49] <elvis4526> doesn't work
[18:13:04] <elvis4526> visibility I meant
[18:13:40] <elvis4526> I tried .css("display", "block") too, no result still hidden.
[18:16:39] <Velveeta> the opposite of .hide() is .show(), it's the differenece between display: none and display: block
[18:30:34] <maslo_> hey guys, just wondering if there's any workaround for onload="scrollTo" on an iframe that is on another domain....can't use iframe.contentWindow.scrollTo because I don't have the permission
[19:05:01] <d10n-work> How do I select a <h1> with the id (no quotes) "temp.md#intro" ? $("#temp.md#intro").length is 0
[19:06:56] <AoiC> use double slash to escape the second # symbol
[19:07:09] <AoiC> I think $('#temp.md\\intro') should work
[19:07:16] <AoiC> err
[19:07:20] <AoiC> I think $('#temp.md\\#intro') should work
[19:07:37] <AoiC> judging by this: http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/faq/how-do-i-select-an-element-by-an-id-that-has-characters-used-in-css-notation/
[19:08:11] <d10n-work> doesn't work (jQuery 2.1.3)
[19:10:44] <d10n-work> $($('h1')[0]).attr('id')     =>   "temp.md#contents"     $("#temp.md\\#contents").length     =>    0
[19:11:49] <AoiC> http://jsfiddle.net/xhbnu54s/5/
[19:12:12] <AoiC> apparently one has to work with the replace method
[19:14:20] <d10n-work> aaah I forgot about the .
[19:22:05] <d10n-work> AoiC: where did that list of special characters come from?
[19:23:10] <AoiC> I think it came from here: http://totaldev.com/content/escaping-characters-get-valid-jquery-id
[19:28:17] <d10n-work> my google-fu must be weak tonight
[19:28:30] <d10n-work> thanks
[19:28:34] <AoiC> hehe no problem
[19:28:56] <_blizzy_> so, I have a question. I have a menu that toggles width. https://gist.github.com/NotBlizzard/851fe76abe49d843db98 however, when I try to open it, it opens, then closes
[19:29:01] <_blizzy_> instead of staying open.
[19:29:51] <AoiC> is the click perhaps issued twice?
[19:30:31] <_blizzy_> no. c:
[19:30:54] <AoiC> what jquery version are you using? or uhm.. make a fiddle?
[19:32:45] <_blizzy_> I'm using jquery-rails, so jquery 1.9 I assume.
[19:34:34] <AoiC> ok
[19:34:38] <AoiC> I reproduced your bug I think
[19:34:52] <_blizzy_> ok.
[19:34:52] <AoiC> http://jsfiddle.net/nr2btdpr/
[19:34:59] <AoiC> brb
[19:48:14] <AoiC> Alright - so hum.. not sure what's cosing it D:
[19:50:48] <AoiC> _blizzy_ I think I had done something wrong.. as far as I see it, it works properly
[19:51:05] <_blizzy_> AoiC, oh. well, thank you.
[19:51:59] <AoiC> http://jsfiddle.net/nr2btdpr/1/ this.. BUT the way you specified it, "extended" class does not really contain the width, does it?
[19:52:22] <AoiC> because if it does, you would probably have to animate it in a different way (perhaps using CSS3 animations or transitions)
[19:59:10] <AoiC> @ _blizzy_ http://jsfiddle.net/nr2btdpr/2/ should do the trick without using .animate.. but older browsers do not support this I believe

[21:52:01] <Tsulong> Howdy!... I got a quick question regarding this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/Tsulong/td3yhwd1/1/
[21:52:07] <Tsulong> I'm attempting to use a popup box, as an input box for my JSON, when i do this, it is not working properly ( Seems to make the
[21:52:10] <Tsulong>                 "data" object weird ) However, when i replace "DataSet" var w/
[21:52:13] <Tsulong>                 the actual Dataset, ( same thing im copying / pasting into the
[21:52:15] <Tsulong>                 input and getting with .val() ) it's working, So i seem to have
[21:52:18] <Tsulong>                 some like, weirdness going on w/ the element.val() corrupting
[21:52:20] <Tsulong>                 the json, or maybe i'm jsut a complete noob :P
[21:52:27] <Tsulong> Oh lord, my bad on that copy/paste! I'm not used to using irc on my vps yet!
[21:54:15] <DragonPunch> OH lORD!
[21:55:16] <Tsulong> yap, lol! my bad
