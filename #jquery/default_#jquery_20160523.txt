[03:32:04] <hellyeah> what is the reason of not loading jquery datepicker on https?
[03:52:53] <Cork> hellyeah: what?
[03:53:12] <Cork> that question makes no sense...
[03:55:18] <hellyeah> when i work with https in jquery. datepicker didnt show when i click input box
[03:55:26] <hellyeah> if i do that http it works fluent
[03:55:46] <Cork> well most likely cause you load a dependency over over http
[03:55:54] <Cork> so the browser blocks it
[03:56:13] <Cork> (mixed content)
[03:57:53] <hellyeah> i guess so but jquery library is http
[03:58:12] <Cork> uh, then you picked a bad cdn
[03:58:13] <hellyeah> why there is no https version of it i just wonder this
[03:58:20] <Cork> there are
[03:58:33] <hellyeah> humm
[03:58:43] <kareeoleez> I am trying to use the http://robinherbots.github.io/jquery.inputmask/ and I want to enter the word "iface" before letting the user write 2 digits : http://pastie.org/private/xnif8jx8g2r3irbafwxmza
[03:58:52] <hellyeah> i didnt knoww thos exist then it is good
[03:59:04] <kareeoleez> I validate with RegEx but I can't set the word I want there by default
[03:59:22] <kareeoleez> any ideas ? Has anyone used this plugin? Or anything else to suggest for jQuery ?
[03:59:27] <Cork> kareeoleez: make a jsfiddle
[03:59:39] <Cork> (with a working example of the problem)
[04:15:08] <kareeoleez> Cork: http://jsfiddle.net/mMkG9/53/
[04:17:18] <Cork> kareeoleez: http://jsfiddle.net/mMkG9/54/
[04:18:22] <kareeoleez> Cork: not exactly. I want "iface" predefined as a prefix. So If you are going to write 44 you will get iface44
[04:20:07] <Cork> kareeoleez: there documentation sucks, but looking at the code, it doesn't support adding extra data in the input field
[04:20:29] <Cork> an option might be to put it infront of the field
[04:20:30] <kareeoleez> any other way to setup a mask with jquery ?
[04:20:39] <kareeoleez> Cork: might work
[04:21:09] <Cork> kareeoleez: masks is generaly considered bad ui, so it isn't commonly used
[04:21:41] <Cork> (the norm is to allow the entry and then give validation error instead)
[04:23:03] <kareeoleez> Cork: ok this works
[04:23:05] <kareeoleez> thank you
[04:23:17] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> Hey, I was wondering why not(ui-selected) isnt honored after reselecting elements? Droppable should not accept ui-selected classes which it does on the first attempt, but if i reselect it doesnt honor it anymore. https://jsfiddle.net/3gggh6bg/19/
[04:23:32] <Cork> kareeoleez: another option might be http://digitalbush.com/projects/masked-input-plugin/#demo (never used it)
[04:23:48] <kareeoleez> no I am ok with validation errors
[04:24:01] <kareeoleez> it isn't worth it finally to waste a lot of time to set it up
[04:24:22] <Cork> kareeoleez: in that case you can do it with basic html form pattern attribute
[04:24:25] <Cork> no need for js at all :)

[05:55:43] <baako> morning guys i have 2 issues with this https://jsfiddle.net/baako/oomb1pty/4/ 1 i cannot get the value of the cardID id and also i cannot remove the corresponding parent
[06:40:59] <baako> anyone around?
[06:58:48] <jerit> baako whats up
[07:00:00] <baako> hi jerit https://jsfiddle.net/baako/oomb1pty/5/ i want to get the value of the hidden field with the id of CardId for the corresponding parent
[07:00:57] <baako> if that makes sense for e.g. if you click on any of the "remove card" button i want to get the the value for id="CardId" for that button information
[07:06:03] <jerit> baako https://jsfiddle.net/oomb1pty/6/
[07:06:39] <jerit> I added the card number as the id of the row, but you don't need to do that - you can take that out actually
[07:07:11] <jerit> actually this looks better https://jsfiddle.net/oomb1pty/7/
[07:13:37] <jerit> baako you almost had it. Just needed to select the correct element for the .remove();
[07:15:36] <baako> jerit, thanks you very much
[07:16:11] <fuchstronaut> q
[07:27:13] <Duikb00t> o/
[07:27:20] <Duikb00t> Is there a way to 'un instantiate a plugin' ?
[07:36:03] <hellyeah> Duikb00t:  i dont understand the question can you rephraraphrase it?
[07:36:04] <Duikb00t> Figured it out
[07:36:05] <Cork> Duikb00t: like i told you last time
[07:36:12] <Duikb00t> Yeah I just figure dit out
[07:36:14] <Cork> yes, if the plugin provides a way
[07:36:22] <Duikb00t> $.fn.fullpage.destroy('all');
[07:36:40] <Cork> but there aren't any generic ways
[07:36:59] <Cork> so the question isn't answerable in the way you asked it
[07:37:23] <Duikb00t> :D ok
[07:37:37] * hellyeah search another way
[07:37:40] <Duikb00t> 1 other thing I asked last time also about how to trigger 'resize' immeditly
[07:37:50] <Duikb00t> But it seems that's not really working the way Im doing it
[07:37:59] <Duikb00t> Will make a quick paste
[07:38:10] <hellyeah> jsfiddle
[07:38:15] <hellyeah> try jsfiddle
[07:38:38] <Duikb00t> Fiddle is hard
[07:38:45] <Duikb00t> then I have to send the whole website?
[07:39:16] <hellyeah> you should prepare small example Cork probably will tell you same thing
[07:39:47] <Duikb00t> I know and I mostly can but this is about the whole scaling thing :D from the website
[07:39:54] <Duikb00t> It's not something specific
[07:39:57] <Cork> Duikb00t: the examples are sometimes hard
[07:40:34] <Cork> Duikb00t: but firstly it makes you think about the problem, and you would be surprised how often that is enough to solve the problem
[07:40:58] <Duikb00t> I know what the problem is
[07:41:04] <Cork> Duikb00t: secondly, ppl give you of there time for free, the work to prepare the example to make there investment smaller and easier to help
[07:41:10] <Cork> is your payment for the help
[07:41:11] <hellyeah> then you can do small example
[07:42:08] * hellyeah it is really fair
[07:42:55] * Duikb00t tries to generate some fiddle thing
[07:43:55] <Cork> Duikb00t: ah, sorry missed the question you asked there
[07:44:10] <Cork> Duikb00t: trigger('resize') on ready should work find
[07:44:13] <Cork> *fine
[07:44:24] <Duikb00t> .trigger-resize
[07:44:31] <Duikb00t> Should I couple that to the ready event?
[07:44:39] <Duikb00t> .trigger('resize'); *
[07:44:41] <Cork> $(function() { $(window).on('resize', function() {}).trigger('resize'); });
[07:45:16] <Cork> if you bind it to window you don't need the $(function() {}); part
[07:45:28] <Cork> (as the object is always there)
[07:49:10] <Duikb00t> Ok ok ok that's great ! Thanks figured that out
[07:49:11] <Duikb00t> now some other bugfixes :
[07:49:17] <Duikb00t> :P *
[07:52:01] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> Hey, I was wondering why not(ui-selected) isnt honored after reselecting elements? Droppable should not accept ui-selected classes which it does on the first attempt, but if i reselect it doesnt honor it anymore. https://jsfiddle.net/3gggh6bg/19/
[07:54:18] <Cork> UnfixedSNIPERJ: $(".droppable").not('.ui-selected').droppable() <-- this line first finds all .droppable in the page, then excludes all with .ui-selected
[07:54:23] <Cork> and then statically add droppable to those
[07:54:43] <Cork> so if any of those elements survive you will get mixed results
[07:56:11] <Cork> UnfixedSNIPERJ: also -moz-grabbing <-- no need for the prefix here
[07:56:14] <Cork> just use grabbing
[07:57:09] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> hmmmm so i would i make that not statically add
[07:57:17] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> but add whenever selectable is triggered
[07:57:46] <Cork> UnfixedSNIPERJ: the better option is to have a function checking if the droppables should be draggable
[07:57:48] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> because it works as expected on the first trigger, but reselecting it doenst
[07:57:55] <Cork> and abort the start action if they aren't
[07:58:03] <Cork> then you don't have to add and remove the class all the time
[08:01:23] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> droppables even when selected can be dragged though
[08:02:02] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> the full blown code is for my filemanager
[08:02:10] <Cork> my point is you can control that from the hooks
[08:02:18] <Cork> you don't have to modify the dom back and forth to do it
[08:02:49] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> oh ok, ill give that a try
[08:03:24] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> i tried doing something like that before but it killed my selectable functionality for some reason, ill try a different route though :)
[08:04:56] <Duikb00t> omg ><
[08:05:04] <Duikb00t> fullpage.js drives me nutz
[08:09:43] <Dayshine> What's a good way of globally dealing with error (e.g. 403) responses to ajax requests? I'm struggling with local event handlers firing before global ones.
[08:10:23] <Cork> Dayshine: personally i just wrap the $.ajax call and have the wrapper function add the fail handler
[08:10:57] <Cork> function ajaxCall(url, option) { return $.ajax(url, option).fail(errorHandle); });
[08:14:34] <Duikb00t> http://kopy.io/ITF7K  this feels bad
[08:14:42] <Duikb00t> line: 118 till 124
[08:14:58] <Duikb00t> I have to create the ID's myself because fullPage.js is creating them aswell.. ><
[08:15:07] <Duikb00t> But when fullpagejs detects they are already there it's all broken ><
[08:15:54] <Duikb00t> I could removeAttr but that would work.. but isn't that really dirty?
[08:16:27] <taplar> do those elements already exist on page load?
[08:16:45] <Dayshine> Cork: Wouldn't the option "error" fire before the "fail"? Or are you using ajaxCall().fail() for your "error"?
[08:17:11] <Duikb00t> taplar:  those classes? yes
[08:17:13] <Cork> Dayshine: ajaxCall(url).fail(function() {})
[08:17:15] <Cork> no :)
[08:17:35] <taplar> i'd cache those selectors then.  i don't remember if resize fires as crazy as scroll, but it's still a good idea
[08:17:40] <Cork> you shouldn't mix error and fail and success done
[08:17:49] <Cork> as the call order gets mixed up
[08:18:13] <taplar> what's the issue though? i'm late to the party
[08:18:20] <taplar> ^ Duikb00t
[08:18:31] <Duikb00t> Scaling from desktop to mobile with fullpage.js
[08:18:58] <Dayshine> Yeah, I can see that. But i've currently got error usage everywhere, and ajaxSetup to override default error seems... bad :(
[08:19:23] <Dayshine> I guess I could use the wrapper to prepend the error handler into the error option
[08:19:43] <skywater> hi
[08:20:13] <skywater> when i call this function: .slideUp(fadeTime, function() { , a div must be removed. But it refreshes the page.. Any idea why ?
[08:24:56] <Cork> skywater: where are you calling this?
[08:25:07] <Cork> you most likely aren't preventing an event you should
[08:25:35] <Cork> (meaning the section you copied isn't responsible)
[08:25:56] <skywater> Cork, i think because i did this In a <Form>  I have a <button>Remove</button> for removing an item from the shopping cart. I think its calling the post
[08:25:56] <skywater> :)
[08:26:10] <Cork> skywater: ya type="button"
[08:26:22] <Cork> button's default action is submit
[08:26:31] <Cork> *buttons
[08:26:59] <Cork> if i wasn't clear <button type="button"> is what you want
[08:27:57] <skywater> Cork,  Ive put a return false; in the click function
[08:28:18] <Cork> skywater: i would strongly recommend NOT to use return false
[08:28:26] <Cork> use event.preventDefault() instead
[08:28:39] <Cork> return false; means you can't ever bind another event handler to that element
[08:28:44] <Cork> as your event handler will kill the event
[08:29:23] <Cork> skywater: also the correct solution is to just not trigger the event and that is thought type="button"
[08:29:24] <Cork> so...
[08:29:41] <skywater> let me try :)
[08:30:23] <skywater> works Cork:)
[08:30:53] <skywater> I used type="button¨
[08:31:12] <skywater> thanks
[08:40:38] <UnfixedSNIPERJ> Cork, so when i make this function, how do abort the start action?

[08:53:01] <ademzenuni> hello
[08:53:14] <ademzenuni> does anoyone know why my jquery isnt working on foundation for apps but on mamp it is working ?
[08:53:48] <taplar> console errors?
[08:54:04] <ademzenuni> no errors..
[08:54:24] <ademzenuni> when i put the file on mamp and start.. the query code will show up.. but on foundation for apps it does not load
[08:57:56] <taplar> not familiar with foundation, but are you saying the file doesn't load at all?  like it's not putting the script load in there?
[08:58:16] <taplar> this guy? http://foundation.zurb.com/
[08:59:54] <ademzenuni> the fiel does load... but the script doesnt show up...
[08:59:59] <ademzenuni> when im putting all in mampp

[09:03:58] <ornerymoose> Hello. I’m trying to cycle through multiple videos (ie, after video 1 finishes, video 2 will automatically start. After video 2 finishes, video 3 will start. Then back to video 1). I’m looking around for some jquery examples/plugins but not coming across much. Anyone have any suggestions?
[09:05:17] <taplar> ornerymoose: not sure about plugins, but you should look into the events that your video player fires.  you may/should be able to catch events related to play state
[09:05:40] <ornerymoose> taplar: alrighty, thank you.
[09:11:31] <hellyeah> taplar:  sup
[09:11:55] <taplar> nada, just chattin with Duikb00t and waiting for the day to start
[09:13:22] <Duikb00t> :)
[09:21:00] <The_Photographer> hi
[09:21:06] <The_Photographer> somebody use mustache.js?
[09:21:13] <The_Photographer> I have problems to render whitespace
[09:21:42] <The_Photographer> for example "{{hellow}} {{Peter}}" render "hellowPeter"
[09:38:42] <Cork> The_Photographer: can't reproduce https://jsfiddle.net/pj6kse00/1/
[09:38:53] <Cork> The_Photographer: i suspect it is something else modifying the string
[09:41:06] <The_Photographer> Cork, anyway I added a var with "Hellow Peter" inside called {{HellowPeter}} and its working, maybe not the best practice
[09:48:07] <z1haze> hey I have a string like app_core_main_oh how could i only capture the _oh or the oh?
[09:49:18] <taplar> you could split on '_' and take the last token
[09:49:31] <z1haze> how would i know which is the last
[09:49:42] <taplar> it's an array, take the last element
[09:49:52] <z1haze> ahh ok
[09:50:24] <taplar> for ease of use: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/pop
[09:58:13] <hellyeah> taplar_:  what does "nada" mean?
[10:01:01] <Duikb00t> nada = nothing
[10:05:25] <aldum|zeratul> hi
[10:05:48] <aldum|zeratul> how would one write this: $($(this)[0]).data();
[10:05:55] <aldum|zeratul> in a less roundabout way?
[10:06:57] <Ulrike> Lol what
[10:07:17] <Ulrike> Can't you just do $(this).data ()?
[10:07:29] <aldum|zeratul> no
[10:07:32] <aldum|zeratul> I tried that
[10:07:44] <Ulrike> That's really weird.
[10:08:02] <aldum|zeratul> wait
[10:08:08] <Ulrike> Either way, if you're working on this, you're only ever going to get 1 element as far as I'm aware. So I don't get why you're pulling the first element
[10:08:16] <aldum|zeratul> nope, I didn't
[10:08:18] <aldum|zeratul> seems to work now
[10:08:18] <Ulrike> Well the html of the first found element
[10:08:23] <aldum|zeratul> weird
[10:08:25] <Ulrike> I was going to say :p
[10:09:12] <Ulrike> You usually don't have to select a specific element when dealing with jquery. If you find that you need only 1 element, make the search as specific as you can vs using the index of the element
[10:09:41] <Uhkis> aldum|zeratul: $(this).eq(0).data();
[10:10:46] <Ulrike> That would also work!
[10:11:00] <Ulrike> And you don't have to fight with taking the html back into jquery
[10:11:51] <aldum|zeratul> I'm doing a modal dialog
[10:12:04] <aldum|zeratul> which is opened by an element of a list
[10:12:21] <aldum|zeratul> and it is dependent on which list element triggered it
[10:12:31] <Ulrike> Makes sense
[10:12:54] <Ulrike> I'd say Uhkis's solution makes it specific how you want it to be
[10:12:56] <hellyeah> fiddle?
[10:13:45] <baako> jerit, are you still here?
[10:17:46] <Duikb00t> taplar_:  you still here? :D
[10:27:29] <baako> hi guys https://jsfiddle.net/baako/oomb1pty/8/ i want to show the message to the corresponding div
[10:27:35] <baako> instead of all of them
[10:44:53] <baako> anyone please
[10:48:49] <taplar_> you realize you can't repeat ids, right?
[10:49:01] <jerit> baako I'm looking into it
[10:49:32] <taplar_> not your issue, but your repeating id RemoveCard, which isn't valid
[10:49:56] <jerit> never even noticed that
[10:50:06] <jerit> I'm not seeing a logical way in his code to select JUST the span he wants
[10:51:05] <taplar_> https://jsfiddle.net/oomb1pty/9/
[10:51:15] <jerit> I added data[e].id as an ID on the span but the selector doesn't seem to want to work
[10:51:51] <jerit> well there you go then lol
[10:52:37] <taplar_> don't really like it but it works, :)
[10:52:48] <taplar_> not crazy about the html in the markup either...
[10:54:53] <taplar_> also data is an array, you could use forEach() instead of for (var in data)
[10:55:31] <taplar_> and you have a vanilla lookup mixed in with your jquery lookups...
[10:57:44] * taplar_ lingers back to his real job
[11:43:42] <IamTrying> http://jsfiddle.net/rpaul/p4s5k59s/5/ - How can i make the canvas to PDF file save in the disk? (silent)
[11:43:52] <IamTrying> its not working http://jsfiddle.net/rpaul/p4s5k59s/5/
[11:44:07] <robertmaxrees> "save in the disk (silent)"?
[11:44:18] <robertmaxrees> and look at your console first.
[11:45:00] <robertmaxrees> http://mrrio.github.io/jsPDF/dist/jspdf.debug.js - this isn't the link you want.
[11:45:19] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: jsPDF is not defined
[11:45:28] <robertmaxrees> see the erropr up a little higher?
[11:46:06] <IamTrying> Oh Yeah. Ja ja ja thats what i wanted man robertmaxrees, thanks, i need to silently print that PDF from C:\here.pdf
[11:46:09] <robertmaxrees> you're linking to a page about jspdf, not the js file itself.
[11:46:32] <robertmaxrees> IamTrying you cannot "silently" do so.  you'll get a prompt to save the sile.
[11:46:34] <robertmaxrees> *file.
[11:47:23] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: that is the problem, i need to do as so 1) user is watching SCANNER of A4 document camera 2) user click take a snapshot 3) that snapshot has to be saved in the disk and pushed to printer as printing for A4
[11:47:45] <robertmaxrees> you're going to get a save file dialog.
[11:47:48] <IamTrying> how can i make canvas to PDF auto save file (without dialog box or choice to save ..)
[11:47:54] <IamTrying> :(
[11:47:54] <robertmaxrees> you can't.
[11:48:02] <robertmaxrees> that's a really bad idea.
[11:48:22] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: i can. can i not upload the canvas image to local PHP and then dump it as C:\file.pdf?
[11:48:26] <IamTrying> java then prints the pdf
[11:48:31] <robertmaxrees> you can do that server-side, sure.
[11:48:34] <robertmaxrees> but not on the client
[11:48:39] <robertmaxrees> imagine if sites could just save random files to your hard drive in any location?
[11:48:41] <robertmaxrees> see the issue?
[11:49:07] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: server-side i can do but its too much work for me. i was finding a hack how to do it locally within jQuery ... i think there is no other way yet? Google exnteions ??
[11:49:20] <robertmaxrees> you're going to get a save file dialog.
[11:49:29] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: no the javascript has a static file name to save as pdf
[11:49:37] <robertmaxrees> like, no matter what there will be some kind of user interaction to save the file to disk.
[11:49:56] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: in Google chrome when i click on this button, it did not asked me directory to choose on my OSX. Will it be same for Windows?
[11:50:09] <robertmaxrees> what button?
[11:50:10] <IamTrying> then it has to do with Google chrome default download diretory settings
[11:50:16] <IamTrying> file:///Users/sun/Downloads/Images.pdf
[11:50:22] <IamTrying> This one https://parall.ax/products/jspdf/dist/jspdf.debug.js#
[11:50:31] <IamTrying> auto saved the file to file:///Users/sun/Downloads/Images.pdf
[11:50:37] <IamTrying> without asking me any dialog window..
[11:50:45] <robertmaxrees> sure - if the user has that option set on their computer, you're fine.
[11:50:52] <robertmaxrees> but they can change where the file saves to.
[11:50:54] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: that is what i need man!!!!!!
[11:51:17] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: Google chrome will be in --kiosk mode, so still the dialog window will appear?
[11:51:17] <robertmaxrees> then you'll have to have all of you users update their browser settings.
[11:51:31] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: no its a kiosk only manually configuration for one client
[11:51:37] <IamTrying> (not world wide users...)
[11:51:42] <robertmaxrees> errr, this really should be server-side in that case.
[11:52:10] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: i cant use server. because PDF will be violation to go via cloud to my cloud server. they want locally to be scanned and print.
[11:52:19] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: its Government file (Police project)
[11:52:33] <robertmaxrees> 'kay
[11:52:41] <IamTrying> That is why looking for hacks...
[11:52:45] <robertmaxrees> then you'll need to make sure the kiosk is properly configured.
[11:52:57] <robertmaxrees> though i don't see why you can't use a server.
[11:53:19] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: they have limitation for me (i cant do this and that and this etc etc software installations...)
[11:53:52] <robertmaxrees> i really hate it when people take jobs like that.  that interaction should be going the other way around.
[11:53:52] <robertmaxrees> brb
[11:54:21] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: i am allowed to use Google chrome, Command prompt/BATCH, JQuery/Javascript, Python/Java/NodJS. The rest is has to be magic.
[11:54:54] <IamTrying> PHP i am not allowed. That means i cant spend so much time to simply build a GET/POST server using Python, Java. But can i not use NodeJS?
[11:55:25] <IamTrying> Tell jQuery to upload the canvas frame to http://localhost/nodeJS?
[11:55:53] <IamTrying> Then tell NodeJS to save any uploaded canvas frames to C:\iam_pdf_from_browser.pdf
[11:56:02] <IamTrying> Then tell Java to print this PDF file from C:\...
[11:56:14] <robertmaxrees> back
[11:56:20] <IamTrying> OK
[11:56:34] <IamTrying> Guru advise me, i am out of my stock now robertmaxrees
[11:56:40] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[11:57:06] <IamTrying> So the scanning is done, i have the image in Canvas. now how can we print it silently from Google chrome to local Printer?
[11:57:14] <robertmaxrees> back way up.
[11:57:21] <robertmaxrees> you're changing your requirements.
[11:57:28] <robertmaxrees> you want to silently print from the browser?
[11:57:34] <IamTrying> robertmaxrees: Exactly
[11:57:47] <robertmaxrees> in chrome.
[11:58:16] <IamTrying> Using Chromium/Google chrome yes
[11:58:23] <robertmaxrees> https://www.shoptill-e.com/support/48
[11:59:05] <IamTrying> WT.... really? robertmaxrees wow!!!
[11:59:18] <robertmaxrees> google is your friend.
[12:00:58] <decx> it's a POS alright
[12:01:04] <IamTrying> Thanks man!!! i will test this. Do you have any idea how old that documentation is? robertmaxrees. Because since Google chrome version 46 they screwed and removed many many options, which is available in google results but not in chrome anymore.
[12:01:39] <robertmaxrees> i have no idea.
[12:01:55] <robertmaxrees> but if you can control the environment that tightly, you can install a specific version of chrome
[12:01:56] <IamTrying> That will be the surprise part 2. that Google chrome removed those options.
[12:33:00] <decx> they actually did
[12:33:31] <robertmaxrees> sounds like using a specific version then.
[13:05:54] <Es0teric> anybody here?
[13:05:57] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[13:06:00] <robertmaxrees> about 600 people/.
[13:06:05] <robertmaxrees> :)
[13:12:28] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees alright so i have this problem here: https://jsfiddle.net/jbs8jxuy/ when the bookmark is clicked, it doesnt change the div immediately depending on the data.code
[13:12:42] <robertmaxrees> wut
[13:13:00] <robertmaxrees> that looks like templating code.
[13:13:07] <robertmaxrees> have a a version with actual HTML?
[13:13:40] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees https://jsfiddle.net/jbs8jxuy/2/
[13:13:40] <taplar_> why not do a success handler?
[13:13:51] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:13:56] <Es0teric> taplar_ either on success or done it still does the same thing
[13:14:09] <taplar_> oh, sure, just wondering
[13:14:11] <robertmaxrees> you want .then(), and I'm lost about what the issue is.
[13:14:19] <robertmaxrees> $(this).find('i').removeClass('fa-bookmark-o').addClass('fa-bookmark'); doesn't work?
[13:14:24] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees no
[13:14:30] <Es0teric> it does not change on click
[13:14:31] <robertmaxrees> are you even hitting that block?
[13:14:34] <Es0teric> yes
[13:14:46] <robertmaxrees> also, $('#book-bookmark').on('click', function() { inside of another handler is a no-no.
[13:14:56] <robertmaxrees> but your issue is $(this).
[13:15:08] <Es0teric> is it?
[13:15:10] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is not the element at that point.
[13:15:18] <Es0teric> what should it be then?
[13:15:29] <robertmaxrees> pretty common to do var $this = $(this); at the top of the click handler and then use $this instead.
[13:15:36] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you want to .bind() the correct reference.
[13:17:16] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees but then why would'nt it be the correct element at that point with $(this) ?
[13:17:19] <Es0teric> i dont understand that one
[13:17:47] <robertmaxrees> so 'this' in javascript is basically a context.
[13:18:18] <robertmaxrees> when you call a function, there are some rules that set 'this' to whatever.  notice how you're passing a function to $.ajax().done()?
[13:18:50] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees yeah
[13:18:51] <robertmaxrees> that function is called by .done(), not by your click handler.
[13:19:09] <Es0teric> ohhh so $(this) references the click handler
[13:19:09] <robertmaxrees> so your invocation context is different.
[13:19:12] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:19:26] <Es0teric> no $(this) references .done()
[13:19:31] <robertmaxrees> sort of.
[13:19:36] <Es0teric> because its being done in that context
[13:19:37] <robertmaxrees> it's a littl more complex than that.
[13:20:10] <robertmaxrees> jquery also likes to change context on you a lot, which is why $(this) works in event handlers in the first place.
[13:21:11] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/tgfu11j9/
[13:21:14] <robertmaxrees> chjeck out your console.
[13:28:03] * taplar_ is about to fall asleep
[13:28:09] <robertmaxrees> long weekend?
[13:28:18] <taplar_> nah, just a slow day
[13:28:58] <tata> yo
[13:29:05] <robertmaxrees> taplar_ hear that.
[13:29:20] <tata> I am wondering facebook or google web developers are using grunt or not
[13:29:27] <robertmaxrees> tata what do you mean?
[13:29:38] <robertmaxrees> tata also: most folks are using gulp these days i'd gyess
[13:29:41] <robertmaxrees> *guess
[13:29:55] <Es0teric> robertmaxrees ahhh i see
[13:30:40] <robertmaxrees> Es0teric :) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/bind for some reading about .bind() and what it does.
[13:33:23] <robertmaxrees> call and apply are two other related methods
[13:33:45] <tata> i just checked facebook frontend script
[13:34:05] <tata> very not-human readable
[13:34:12] <tata> means using something like grunt?
[13:34:13] <robertmaxrees> tata what script?
[13:34:22] <tata> view-source
[13:34:27] <taplar_> minified files usually are not readable
[13:34:27] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.
[13:34:34] <robertmaxrees> that just means they're minimizing or uglifying it.
[13:35:27] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean they're using grunt or gulp, though those are both tools you could use to help with that.
[13:35:43] <robertmaxrees> grun and gulp are just task runners.  you'd have to get an actual tool that handles the minification part for you.
[13:36:16] <tata> hm i think I get it
[13:36:26] <robertmaxrees> are you looking to do something similar?
[13:39:23] <tata> are you looking to do something similar??
[13:39:32] <taplar_> borg
[13:39:45] <robertmaxrees> what?
[13:39:52] <robertmaxrees> tata why do you ask?
[13:39:52] <taplar_> tata: what problem are you trying to address?
[13:39:56] <robertmaxrees> ^ :)
[13:40:43] <tata> no I am wondering how to automatically import or include my .js sources at once
[13:40:49] <tata> in one directory
[13:41:10] <robertmaxrees> that's different form what you were asking before.
[13:41:47] <tata> i am wondering what other sites looks like
[13:41:58] <robertmaxrees> you mean what they use ooor...?
[13:42:21] <tata> most sites I've been went are only import or include 4~5 .js
[13:42:35] <robertmaxrees> because there are a lot of choices.  SOme places use something like require.js which can then compile everything into a single file, for instance.
[13:42:48] <tata> maybe it's only my problem to load almost 100 .js sources
[13:42:49] <taplar_> are you concerned with latency?
[13:43:03] <robertmaxrees> yeah sounds like you need to concat + minify
[13:43:03] <taplar_> that's a bit much
[13:43:13] <robertmaxrees> that's not an uncommon problem at all.
[13:43:45] <tata> <script src="scripts/heroes/RichardStallman.js"></script>
[13:43:46] <tata> <script src="scripts/heroes/BillGates.js"></script>
[13:43:50] <tata> think about it
[13:43:55] <robertmaxrees> right...
[13:43:58] <tata> heroes are so many
[13:44:04] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:44:10] <robertmaxrees> hence my suggestion.
[13:44:15] <robertmaxrees> you need to concat + minify
[13:45:05] <tata> http://salvatore.garbesi.com/lint-concat-minify-with-gruntjs/              maybe this site?
[13:45:11] <robertmaxrees> don't use grunt.
[13:45:15] <tata> i'm new to grunt world
[13:45:20] <robertmaxrees> use gulp.
[13:45:40] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/24597914
[13:45:45] <tata> because?
[13:46:15] <robertmaxrees> better config syntax, easier to use, better support in my experience.
[13:46:45] <tata> why we uglify codes anyway?
[13:46:51] <robertmaxrees> minifies it.
[13:47:03] <robertmaxrees> js doesn't require whitespace, so why transmit any of it?
[13:47:17] <taplar_> 'v' means just as much to the compiler as 'myHero'
[13:47:20] <robertmaxrees> also shortens variable names and things to make the code even more compact.
[13:47:25] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:47:38] <robertmaxrees> also make sure you turn on compression on your server.
[14:02:48] <taplar_> funny you should mention that.  last friday i realized our tomcat servers were not doing that, :)
[14:02:56] <robertmaxrees> !
[14:02:58] <robertmaxrees> oh shit.
[14:03:29] <taplar_> yeah, i've recommended we do it for at least or html/css/js.  and then maybe json if everyone can handle it
[14:03:46] <robertmaxrees> everyone *should* be able to.
[14:04:01] <robertmaxrees> since the browser handles the decoding.  can't think of any browsers that would break.
[14:04:13] <taplar_> i would hope so.  browser and the groovy class handles gzip automatically
[14:04:20] <robertmaxrees> there you go.
[14:04:22] <taplar_> just a question of what the java guys are using for their rest endpoints
[14:04:37] <taplar_> err, rest clients
[14:04:52] <robertmaxrees> ah, yeah.
[14:17:43] <groundup> I have a variable number of AJAX requests that get fired in a loop. After all of them are complete I want to call a function. Is there a best practice for this? I don't really want to have to count the number of requests and then check that they have all returned. Is there a way to easily do variable number of promises?
[14:17:56] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[14:17:59] <robertmaxrees> $.when.apply()
[14:18:17] <robertmaxrees> and i'd use a .map() to get an array of promises
[14:25:38] <groundup> I did var deferred = []; $.each(..., function(...) { deferred.push($.getJSON()); }; $.when.apply($, deferred).then(function() { callFunc() })
[14:26:21] <groundup> Thanks for the help
[14:26:26] <robertmaxrees> something about that looks off.  mind trying agin?
[14:26:28] <robertmaxrees> *again?
[14:26:32] <robertmaxrees> and use .map() here instead.
[14:26:43] <groundup> What's the benefit of .map here?
[14:26:56] <robertmaxrees> you can directly return out the array instead of doing a 2 step operation.
[14:27:05] <robertmaxrees> var allDeferreds = someArray.map();
[14:27:32] <robertmaxrees> also - then(function() { callFunc() }) could probably get shortened to just .then(callFunc);
[14:28:08] <groundup> The then() has a bunch more than just callFunc(). Just used that as an example
[14:28:16] <robertmaxrees> alright.
[14:28:20] <robertmaxrees> just pointing it out.
[14:29:24] <groundup> So, if the each iterates over data, do $.map(data, function(k, v) { return getJSON() }); $.when.apply().then()?
[14:29:38] <robertmaxrees> just use a native map.
[14:29:42] <groundup> ok
[14:29:53] <robertmaxrees> if you need to use the jquery one for some reason, you'll have to .get() it after.
[14:30:51] <groundup> brb, seeing if I got it right
[14:33:01] <groundup> Hmm... nope
[14:33:12] <robertmaxrees> show yer code in a bpaste.
[14:35:12] <groundup> data is an object
[14:35:30] <robertmaxrees> oh a plain object?
[14:35:32] <robertmaxrees> that'd do it.
[14:35:40] <robertmaxrees> then yeah, gonna have to each it.
[14:35:41] <groundup> Yeah, I had to check it heh
[14:36:07] <groundup> I oft forget where jQuery starts and JS ends
[14:36:50] <robertmaxrees> er
[14:36:54] <robertmaxrees> jquery IS js :)
[14:37:21] <groundup> Yeah, but JS is not jQ
[14:37:33] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:37:37] <robertmaxrees> nor is it express.
[14:37:48] <taplar> i kinda want to disagree
[14:37:56] <groundup> Yeah, just saying sometimes I forget what's possible with pure JS and what I have to use a lib for
[14:38:11] <robertmaxrees> you can enumerate properties without a lib fwiw.
[14:38:28] <robertmaxrees> if you can any control over the thing generating data, you should just convert that data to an array instead.
[14:38:29] <groundup> Also, my JS-fu is not superb
[14:39:13] <groundup> data is the result of an AJAX request. It makes more sense as an object outside of this context so I'm going to keep it as such
[14:39:33] <robertmaxrees> but you're consuming it in JS.
[14:39:45] <groundup> So?
[14:39:49] <ckb> Hey guys, I’m running into a bit of a problem… I have a blur bound, but it seems like the click that triggers the blur doesn’t fully propagate..
[14:40:04] <robertmaxrees> ckb the blur or the click
[14:40:04] <robertmaxrees> ?
[14:40:13] <ckb> robertmaxrees: the click
[14:40:24] <groundup> (btw, not arguing. I'm really interested in making my code better and being a better JS/jQ dev)
[14:40:24] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't sound right.  have a fiddle?
[14:40:40] <ckb> I guess…. my real question, how do I figure out the target of the click that triggers the blur?
[14:40:53] <robertmaxrees> ckb i thought you said the click isn't propogating?
[14:41:09] <SpecialTEch> Is there a way to add classes to elements outside of a click event?
[14:41:25] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTEch totally depends - what's the relation to the clicked element?
[14:41:35] <robertmaxrees> groundup yeah deffo - lots of people really like using plain objects when an array would be more appropriate.
[14:41:37] <groundup> You have an event listener on click and you want the caller? Use this
[14:41:52] <SpecialTEch> I'm creating an accordion - and want to add classes to the nonactive elements
[14:41:53] <robertmaxrees> he sound outside of the element.
[14:42:10] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTEch select all the accordions ahead of time and store them in a var
[14:42:18] <ckb> robertmaxrees: here’s a short explanation… I have an overlay that displays on focus (a search bar), but when you click on a search result, the blur triggers and hides the overlay, but the click on anchor doesn’t register
[14:42:30] <groundup> The question is confusing... back to work :) Thanks robertmaxrees.
[14:42:39] <robertmaxrees> ckb is the anchor created dynamically?  oor....?
[14:42:57] <ckb> yes
[14:42:59] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTEch then you do something like $myElements.not(this);
[14:43:01] <robertmaxrees> ckb that's why.
[14:43:05] <robertmaxrees> use a delegated listener.
[14:43:16] <SpecialTEch> Ah maybe thats why my not was not working
[14:43:19] <robertmaxrees> and attach to the closest parent that doesn't get dynamically created.
[14:43:20] <SpecialTEch> T_T
[14:43:54] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTEch what were you doing?
[14:43:59] <ckb> the dynamic anchor should have the default event bound on click, the anchor is supposed to be a hot anchor, no special listener on the anchor only on the blur
[14:44:23] <SpecialTEch> I was doing $currentVar.not('class-name').animate();
[14:44:24] <robertmaxrees> ckb "the default event bound on click" - so you mean the normal browser clicked anchor behavior is not firing?
[14:44:33] <SpecialTEch> instead of this
[14:44:40] <robertmaxrees> you could use a classname if you want.
[14:44:42] <ckb> robertmaxrees: correct…. my guess is because of my “blur” delegation
[14:44:48] <robertmaxrees> ckb nope.
[14:44:54] <SpecialTEch> Hmm, well it didn't seem to work =\
[14:45:00] <robertmaxrees> ckb that doesn't chgange anything about clicks.
[14:45:03] <SpecialTEch> give me a sec :)
[14:45:04] <ckb> if I take the blur delegation out of the mix, the anchor fires normally
[14:45:12] <robertmaxrees> then you have something else going on.
[14:45:15] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle?
[14:45:29] <ckb> I don’t. :( I’m not even sure I could reproduce it
[14:45:38] <robertmaxrees> sounds like you could.
[14:45:56] <robertmaxrees> you don't need the full thing.
[14:46:15] <robertmaxrees> you could probably skip 90% of what you think you need.
[14:46:22] <ckb> I could give you a live link?
[14:46:36] <robertmaxrees> eh, those are rarely helpful since then I have to dig through all of your code.
[14:46:39] <robertmaxrees> and i can't edit those :)
[14:46:41] <SpecialTEch> robertmaxrees: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/LNwQwb
[14:47:02] <ckb> robertmaxrees: let me see if I can reproduce it
[14:47:37] <robertmaxrees> ckb you should be able to just create the input/other elements and ignore the overlay stuff.
[14:48:00] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTEch you see the error in this, yeah?
[14:49:16] <ckb> robertmaxrees: does fiddle have jquery natively included?
[14:49:39] <robertmaxrees> ckb you add it via a dropdown - click the "javascript" heading in that box.
[14:49:53] <robertmaxrees> and then under Frameworks & Extensions pick a version of jquery.
[14:50:00] <SpecialTEch> robertmaxrees: sorry just updated, realized I had ($this) lol
[14:50:10] <SpecialTEch> but it still won't function :\
[14:50:16] <robertmaxrees> so what SHOULD happen?
[14:50:24] <robertmaxrees> oh, and thgat's not what i meant.
[14:50:51] <SpecialTEch> oh I got it
[14:50:56] <SpecialTEch> :)
[14:51:01] <SpecialTEch> I was using the wrong var
[14:51:07] <robertmaxrees> :) there you go.
[14:51:13] <SpecialTEch> thanks!
[14:51:26] <robertmaxrees> definitely :)
[14:51:31] <SpecialTEch> now to remove the class on active click
[14:51:46] <robertmaxrees> .removeClass() ;)
[14:52:10] <SpecialTEch> yea of course, but that was my next step haha. I built a similar one before but it wasn't responsive... so I had to re-do it lol
[14:52:21] <ckb> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/jo150879/
[14:52:29] <robertmaxrees> what are those classes for, SpecialTEch?
[14:52:48] <robertmaxrees> ckb ah, yeah, this is easy.
[14:52:50] <SpecialTEch> It's just so I know which box to resize using CSS
[14:52:55] <SpecialTEch> vs doing it through jquery
[14:53:08] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTEch the accordion should already be getting classes applied.
[14:53:16] <robertmaxrees> ckb the blur is firing before the click happens.
[14:53:57] <ckb> That’s essentially the issue, but what’s the work around?
[14:54:00] <robertmaxrees> ckb you want a click handler on the document instead.
[14:54:03] <robertmaxrees> not blur.
[14:54:07] <SpecialTEch> yea, of course since I apply the active class, the I needed to apply non active classes - now I just need to make it so when they click on the active one, it removes the active class to bring it back to normal
[14:54:21] <ckb> robertmaxrees: and just check e.target?
[14:54:28] <robertmaxrees> SpecialTEch but there should already be an "active" class of some kind, no?
[14:54:29] <ckb> Didn’t really think about that
[14:55:15] <robertmaxrees> ckb basically.  you check if it or any of its parents match the search box or whatever.  If it does, don't do anything.  If it doesn't do a preventDefault() and close your overlay.
[14:55:33] <robertmaxrees> the other way to do it is to bind a delegated listener for clicks on the overlay.
[14:55:37] <SpecialTEch> yea there is already, I'll just be removing the active class when they re-click on the active box instead of clicking on a nonactive one, so it'll just go back to original state.
[14:56:39] <robertmaxrees> ah you've built your own accordion. nvm.
[15:00:26] <ckb> robertmaxrees: if I just return; the event propagates?
[15:01:03] <robertmaxrees> you're conflating the problem.
[15:01:57] <robertmaxrees> per https://api.jquery.com/on/ -> "Returning false from an event handler will automatically call event.stopPropagation() and event.preventDefault(). A false value can also be passed for the handler as a shorthand for function(){ return false; }. So, $( "a.disabled" ).on( "click", false ); attaches an event handler to all links with class "disabled" that prevents them from being followed when
[15:01:57] <robertmaxrees> they are clicked and also stops the event from bubbling. "
[15:02:27] <robertmaxrees> basically, don't use blur here - it's a bad idea.  don't rely on twisting together handlers.
[15:02:33] <robertmaxrees> do something explicit instead.
[15:04:44] <ckb> I was planning on doc.click if parents.size() <= 0 return
[15:05:07] <robertmaxrees> .size() was deprecated a long time ago.
[15:05:12] <robertmaxrees> .length is preferred.
[15:05:32] <robertmaxrees> and you want .closest() instead of parents() since it'll stop at the first match.
[15:06:39] <robertmaxrees> if (!$(event.target).closest('.parentContainer')) { console.log('click was outside the search dealio'); }
[15:11:33] <SpecialTEch> robertmaxrees: yea, I did haha, I didn't like the bootstrap version. Wasn't working for my UI needs.
[15:11:40] <robertmaxrees> fair enough
[16:12:56] <jonnyreeves> Hey, could someone point me to a high quality jQuery logo for use in a presentation please?
[16:14:33] <snover> jonnyreeves: http://brand.jquery.org/
[16:15:36] <jonnyreeves> perfect, thanks snover
[16:33:53] <Nubville> What is the best way to verify a block of ajax content is done loading completely before firing an animation?
[16:34:20] <robertmaxrees> .done()
[16:34:25] <robertmaxrees> .then(), rather.
[16:35:01] <jerit> I normally fire the animation while the ajax is busy so as to indicate "we're busy working and the site didn't break"
[16:35:26] <robertmaxrees> i think they're more looking to make sure the content exists before operating against it.
[16:35:32] <jerit> but that has a problem when something does break and I don't handle it well then the progress indicator doesn't fugg off then it looks like the work is taking forever but its really errored
[16:35:44] <Nubville> I'm trying to animate to a blog post, but the posts aren't done loading, and it doesn't wait for the content to finish
[16:35:58] <robertmaxrees> yeah, you need to use .then()
[16:35:59] <jerit> oh yeah... none of the stuff I do has ajax doing more than posting data to my controllers
[17:25:54] <robertmaxrees> looking at node web frameworks makes my head hurt.
[17:26:20] * jerit heard that node sucks sweaty donkey balls
[17:26:28] <robertmaxrees> uh
[17:26:35] <robertmaxrees> that's... deescriptive.
[17:26:40] <robertmaxrees> and i actually like it.
[17:26:44] <jerit> just what I heard
[17:26:49] <jerit> never used it myself
[17:27:52] <robertmaxrees> 'kay.
[17:28:26] <jerit> I was intrigued by the idea of a javascript based web server
[17:28:30] <jerit> or was it just java?
[17:28:36] <robertmaxrees> javascript.
[17:28:42] <robertmaxrees> and it's not just for web stuff.
[17:29:12] <robertmaxrees> though it's not the first time somebody tried the idea.  it's the first one to get it right.
[17:30:33] <jerit> I think my knowledge of javascript might be far too limiting for me to develop something like that
[17:30:46] <robertmaxrees> you'd need more than JS.
[17:31:07] <jerit> such as?
[17:32:10] <robertmaxrees> node is written using C, C++, and JS.
[17:33:30] <robertmaxrees> and then the V8 engine is written using Cmostly c++
[17:35:27] <jerit> okay then probably a good job I haven't tried using node. I know nothing about C or C++
[17:37:41] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[17:37:48] <robertmaxrees> you don't need to know those to use it.
[17:38:19] <robertmaxrees> i thought your statement "I think my knowledge of javascript might be far too limiting for me to develop something like that" meant that you wouldn't be able to write something like node.
[17:42:05] <jerit> oh ya it did
[17:42:22] <robertmaxrees> heh.  using node itself is pretty easy/
[17:42:33] <jerit> its late and past my bedtime so don't be too concerned if I stop making sense at any point
[18:09:49] <ckb> robertmaxrees: what’s the easiest way to find the element that is scrolling? I feel like this is de-ja-vu
[18:10:00] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[18:11:29] <ckb> $(“body”).scrollTop() is always returning 0 ;(
[18:11:37] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to get the offset of the page?
[18:12:00] <ckb> I’m trying to snap a menu bar right below the header once you scroll past it
[18:12:15] <ckb> but html, body, and my container divs all are giving me scrollTop = 0
[18:12:22] <robertmaxrees> $(window).scrollTop()
[18:12:42] <ckb> returns 0 as well
[18:12:45] <ckb> ugh
[18:12:54] <robertmaxrees> is it a child element that's scrolling then?
[18:13:16] <ckb> It’s a mess right now… but essentially yes, returns 0 as well
[18:13:31] <robertmaxrees> i'm lost.
[18:13:36] <robertmaxrees> so what element is scrolling?
[18:13:53] <ckb> I can’t for the life of my figure it out
[18:14:02] <ckb> http://cashortrade.org/phish-tickets
[18:14:36] <ckb> it’s either .page or .scroll or the body
[18:14:52] <robertmaxrees> $(window).scrollTop(); is getting me what looks to be the right value.
[18:15:07] <ckb> hmmm Chrome?
[18:15:14] <robertmaxrees> ff
[18:15:24] <robertmaxrees> let me try chromne.
[18:15:26] <ckb> Chrome is giving me 0. weird
[18:15:48] <robertmaxrees> chrome is working fine.
[18:15:52] <robertmaxrees> are you scrolling down first?
[18:15:53] <ckb> :\
[18:15:57] <ckb> yep
[18:16:01] <robertmaxrees> show your code then.
[18:16:16] <ckb> which code?
[18:16:23] <robertmaxrees> that you're using to get the scrolltop
[18:17:02] <ckb> https://jsfiddle.net/9dsbqn8g/
[18:17:15] <robertmaxrees> err.
[18:18:20] <ckb> I’m lost..
[18:18:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9dsbqn8g/1/
[18:18:36] <robertmaxrees> try that.
[18:18:49] <robertmaxrees> or this: https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/9dsbqn8g/2/
[18:19:09] <ckb> working fine for me
[18:19:19] <robertmaxrees> right.
[18:19:21] <robertmaxrees> so use the window.
[18:19:22] <robertmaxrees> not body.
[18:19:27] <robertmaxrees> the window is what has offset.
[18:21:01] <ckb> robertmaxrees: http://i.imgur.com/TSRMECf.png
[18:21:15] <ckb> kind of weird.
[18:21:40] <robertmaxrees> you're not in an iframe or something, right?
[18:21:46] <ckb> correct
[18:22:03] <robertmaxrees> i'd completely kill chrome and restart.
[18:22:41] <ckb> same deal
[18:22:52] <ckb> blargh
[18:23:04] <robertmaxrees> hrm....
[18:23:11] <robertmaxrees> try document.location
[18:23:13] <robertmaxrees> what do you tget?
[18:25:16] <robertmaxrees> woah
[18:25:19] <robertmaxrees> back waaaaay up.
[18:25:24] <robertmaxrees> i got kicked to your homepage earlier.
[18:25:25] <robertmaxrees> hrm.
[18:25:32] <ckb> haha
[18:25:38] <ckb> that’ll do it
[18:25:48] <robertmaxrees> you really broke something here.
[18:25:54] <ckb> :(
[18:26:10] <D-rex> ckb make sure you dont have overflow hidden or height:100% on your css for body
[18:26:46] <ckb> :D
[18:26:51] <robertmaxrees> ^ :) that's exactly your problem.
[18:26:52] <ckb> YAS! Thank you D-rex!
[18:29:22] <ckb> Why does that throw a wrench in everything?
[18:31:30] <robertmaxrees> because you're not scrolling what you thing.
[18:31:33] <robertmaxrees> *think
[21:44:24] <Nubville> So is there a established way to validate when a .append() of data is finished loading from an ajax request? I have an animation that is firing before the content is finished loading
[22:40:27] <Kazuto> I'm inserting some HTML inside another tag via $([outer]).text([inner]);
[22:40:35] <Kazuto> Derp, didn't mean to send it so fast :p
[22:41:21] <Kazuto> I'm inserting some HTML inside another tag via $([outer]).text([inner]). It displays as normal text, but doesn't actually render as HTML (eg. "<p>This is a paragraph</p>" instead of "This is a paragraph"). Is text() not the correct function to use?
[22:48:15] <Kazuto> Nevermind, I found it (html).
[23:16:13] <irwiss> good time of day, i'm trying to animate a bootstrap progress bar's width linearly over 10 sec, it sorta works but nothing happens unless i move mouse in circles in the browser window, i feel like i'm missing something crucial here can anyone give a hint? mtrProgress.animate({width: "100%"}, {duration: 10000, easing: "linear"});
[23:28:01] <irwiss> turns out there was a conflict between css transitions and animate()
[23:30:50] <xenaxon> hi
[23:31:08] <xenaxon> how can I make the jquery ui accordion ONLY expand upon double click
[23:31:24] <xenaxon> I want to make the accordion expand upon double click not on single-click
[23:33:52] <D-rex> $("#accordion").accordion({ event: 'dblclick' });
[23:35:36] <xenaxon> D-rex: REALLY?
[23:35:54] <xenaxon> where can I see all the options in the documentation
[23:35:58] <xenaxon> I find it confusing
[23:36:02] <xenaxon> please excuse my ignorance
[23:37:42] <arc_> https://api.jqueryui.com/accordion/#option-event
[23:38:34] <arc_> if you're asking for the names of all the possible events, they are just the names of javascript events. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events
[23:38:59] <arc_> i'm guessing a lot of those won't actually work, but who knows. the common ones will work anyway
[23:39:45] <arc_> sorry, dom events. i know somebody will correct me on that
[23:40:20] <D-rex> at the bottom of the events docs page the Input Device Events for sure
[23:47:04] <printForever> morning!
