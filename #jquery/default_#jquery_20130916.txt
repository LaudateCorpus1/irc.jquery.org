[00:25:04] <dieguezz> hi, i am trying to send a form with ajax and i want to use the value of one field to customize success message, so it sais something like.. ty John for submit.. http://jsfiddle.net/8R26P/4/ lines 74 - 81. I made it that way but it just doesnt work and i get an empty message
[00:28:36] <Cork> dieguezz: if you add console.log($('#nombre').length) on line 74 what do you get?
[00:28:53] <dieguezz> let me see
[00:29:38] <Cork> dieguezz: side note, you should always have a label for your form fields
[00:30:02] <Cork> else accessible helpers won't know what the field is about
[00:31:13] <dieguezz> [cork] i should place that before $.ajax?
[00:31:19] <Cork> yes
[00:31:34] <Cork> right before or after the $().val() line
[00:32:00] <dieguezz> ok i did it but i just dont get any message
[00:32:05] <dieguezz> but the email is being sent
[00:32:29] <Cork> dieguezz: check your browser console
[00:32:48] <dieguezz> this is the url http://www.montaventura.com/formulario-de-viajes/
[00:32:50] <dieguezz> ill check it
[00:33:13] <dieguezz> i got 3 errors buut i think they are not relatex
[00:33:53] <Cork> you should get a number in there
[00:34:00] <Cork> preferably a 1
[00:34:05] <Cork> but possibly a 0
[00:34:12] <dieguezz> so i am doing something wrong
[00:34:40] <Cork> console.log($('#nombre').length)  directly in the browsers console
[00:34:50] <Cork> (not the same but anyway
[00:34:52] <Cork> )
[00:35:39] <dieguezz> i am getting "underfined"
[00:35:48] <Cork> ah
[00:35:58] <Cork> try console.log(jQuery('#nombre').length)
[00:36:42] <dieguezz> undefined :S
[00:36:49] <Cork> O_o
[00:37:05] <dieguezz> i must be doing something wrong cork
[00:37:06] <Cork> sooo you don't have jquery loaded?
[00:37:24] <dieguezz> yes it is.. because rest of the form is working :S and works with jquery
[00:38:04] <Cork> dieguezz: what about jQuery.fn.jquery ?
[00:38:10] <Cork> btw what browser are you using?
[00:38:13] <dieguezz> let me see
[00:38:19] <dieguezz> i am using google chrome
[00:40:05] <dieguezz> [Cork] u want me to place that inside the chrome console? or in the code?
[00:40:18] <Cork> console
[00:40:27] <dieguezz> i get ... Object {}
[00:40:46] <Cork> from jQuery.fn.jquery ?
[00:40:52] <dieguezz> nono sorry i get undefined
[00:41:00] <dieguezz> i tried,... jQuery.fn = jQuery.prototype = {
[00:41:00] <dieguezz> }
[00:41:18] <Cork> just run "jQuery.fn.jquery" in the console
[00:41:25] <Cork> nothing else
[00:41:28] <Cork> you should get a string back
[00:41:32] <dieguezz> undefined+
[00:41:34] <dieguezz> :(
[00:41:40] <Cork> then your jquery lib is broken
[00:41:47] <Cork> fetch a new copy
[00:42:22] <dieguezz> i include it again?
[00:42:30] <Cork> replace the old one
[00:43:01] <dieguezz> :)
[00:43:05] <dieguezz> 1.6.3 now
[00:43:21] <Cork> that's a bit old, but at least it's a hole lib
[00:43:46] <dieguezz> lets try again
[00:44:38] <dieguezz> lol stil undefined for console.log(jQuery('#nombre').length)
[00:45:04] <dieguezz> i try another version?
[00:45:09] <Cork> no
[00:45:22] <Cork> what about if you run jQuery('#nombre').length directly in the console?
[00:45:37] <dieguezz> oh now i get a 1
[00:45:51] <Cork> ok, so something on the page is breaking console.log
[00:46:03] <dieguezz> but idk why i am getting the page reloaded now
[00:46:05] <Cork> you should find and disable that script, it makes debugging this hard
[00:46:13] <dieguezz> shit, fking wordpress
[00:47:20] <dieguezz> ok now i removed every script src="" and its uusing 1.8.3
[00:47:24] <dieguezz> still same :(
[00:48:46] <Cork> dieguezz: something is seriously messed up with wither your browser or your site...
[00:49:40] <dieguezz> i see, well ill try to go deeper and see what can be
[00:50:25] <Cork> sidenote it is chrome specific
[00:50:30] <Cork> hmm
[00:51:08] <Cork> opps
[00:51:18] <Cork> no too early a conclusion
[00:51:36] <dieguezz> [Cork] ill try another browser
[00:53:24] <dieguezz> nah, same on ff
[00:53:43] <dieguezz> and i am still getting the page reloaded :(
[00:53:57] <dieguezz> at least before it worked to show a simple div with .show()
[00:54:50] <Cork> dieguezz: so console.log(jQuery('#nombre').length) doesn't work for you in any console?
[00:55:05] <Cork> you should get two line output
[00:55:10] <Cork> 1 followed by undefined
[00:55:22] <Cork> (or undefined followed by 1)
[00:55:28] <Cork> depending on the browser
[00:55:35] <dieguezz> in ff i get: undefined followed by 1
[00:55:52] <Cork> but not in chrome?
[00:56:00] <dieguezz> in chrome just uundefined :S
[00:56:07] <Cork> then your chrome is broken
[00:56:17] <dieguezz> [cork] if you want, you can try it here http://www.montaventura.com/formulario-de-viajes/
[00:56:23] <Cork> i am
[00:56:29] <dieguezz> oh it works for you in chrome?
[00:56:31] <Cork> and it works in both browsers here
[00:56:45] <dieguezz> mm ok ill reinstall chrome
[00:56:48] <Cork> you have two missing plugins though
[00:56:56] <Cork> prettyPhoto and fitVids
[00:57:22] <dieguezz> yes, those plugins are broken because of my code, becauuse those warnings only appear on this page
[00:57:46] <Cork> dieguezz: the plugins isn't broken
[00:57:48] <Cork> they are missing
[00:57:49] <dieguezz> i only get the typical analytics warning in all pages
[00:57:57] <dieguezz> oh i shouuld include them
[00:58:14] <dieguezz> lets see
[01:07:32] <dieguezz> Cork, i had a missing </div> xD. now i get different errors ':| ill try to find out anything and ask you if so
[01:33:44] <Asmooh> godmorgon

[02:03:24] <Cork> bah, b-ot doens't have it
[02:03:45] <Cork> ?g down for everyone or just me

[02:04:24] <Cork> oh
[02:04:30] <Cork> b-ot: your slow...
[02:28:29] <krambiorix> hi, how can i catch the event of a draggable that hovers  a non droppable div?
[02:39:23] <steme_jomps> Is it possible to use jQ to create alternate input controllers?
[02:39:42] <steme_jomps> or controls rather
[02:40:03] <steme_jomps> I'm looking to make a signup form more user friendly with some UX design that goes beyond what native input controls can do
[02:40:05] <imjakech_> hey everyone
[02:40:09] <steme_jomps> Should I turn to jQ or JS?
[02:40:26] <imjakech_> Backbone.js question if anyone would know the answer since the documentcloud channel isn't workingâ€¦.
[02:40:45] <imjakech_> how do people deal with ui interactions that aren't a backbone.view ??
[02:40:59] <imjakech_> a separate js file for your normal jQuery code?
[02:41:01] <Cork> steme_jomps: you can, but you have to replace the native elements, and that is hard to get right
[02:41:37] <Cork> as it is very easy to make something that isn't accessible for example, or broken on mobile
[02:41:38] <steme_jomps> Cork: Alright, thanks. How come it's considered hard though? Wouldn't it be as easy as hiding the input and display a different visual representation in its place
[02:41:52] <Cork> steme_jomps: listed two reasons (there are more)
[02:41:54] <steme_jomps> and then feed values to the hidden input based on user interaction with the latter?
[02:42:12] <steme_jomps> Cork: Well, cross platform compatibility is something I'd test for
[02:42:18] <steme_jomps> and I could limit it to certain platforms
[02:43:28] <Cork> steme_jomps: for bit longer list: 1) events comes from the wrong element, so you have to fake that; 2) accessibility tools doesn't see it as input fields unless you take care to add that; 3) those replacements elements doesn't interact with mobiles so ex dropdowns normally breaks badly
[02:43:55] <steme_jomps> Cork: Well, what you're describing sounds like the expected approach to me
[02:44:04] <steme_jomps> rather than issues?
[02:44:09] <Cork> 4) trigger interactions tent to target the wrong element (or no element at all) so you have a problem there
[02:44:22] <steme_jomps> Why would it target the wrong element?
[02:44:23] <Cork> steme_jomps: expected approach?
[02:44:38] <Cork> $('input').change() for example
[02:44:40] <steme_jomps> Cork: Dealing with the things you mentioned
[02:44:49] <Cork> won't match the replacement element as that would be ex. a div
[02:45:11] <Cork> steme_jomps: sure, but to date none of the replacement elements i've seen does
[02:45:21] <Cork> biggest failure is mobile and accessibility
[02:45:36] <Cork> where most of them just face falls
[02:45:40] <steme_jomps> Cork: What do you mean by replacement elements?
[02:45:45] <steme_jomps> I'd code something myself
[02:45:49] <steme_jomps> I'm just wondering if jQ is suitable
[02:45:54] <steme_jomps> and offers the necessary functions :-)
[02:46:23] <Cork> <select></select> gets converted to <div><a></a><ul><li></li></ul></div> for example
[02:46:34] <Cork> steme_jomps: jq can do it
[02:46:41] <steme_jomps> Alright, cool
[02:46:49] <Cork> the problem is the generated html need to actually work with the browser
[02:46:53] <Cork> and that is REALLY hard
[02:47:09] <steme_jomps> Well, I could isolate my script to certain platforms
[02:47:20] <steme_jomps> and expand alongside testing
[02:47:22] <Cork> browsers do a lot of work to make form elements accessable and make sure they work on all platforms
[02:47:39] <Cork> steme_jomps: you could, or you could just limit your self to what you can style natively
[02:47:44] <krambiorix> hi, how can i catch the event of a draggable that hovers  a non droppable div?  In that event i want to make the draggable smaller in width
[02:47:45] <Cork> it's normally a better choice
[02:48:38] <steme_jomps> The entire point is to experiment with how to make controls more accessible. As far as I'm concerned what you're describing is a non-issue since I expect to have to deal with quirks and cross-platform compatibility
[02:48:41] <steme_jomps> and DOM manipulating
[02:48:53] <steme_jomps> and the way I see it, I could just start with one platform/browser
[02:48:58] <steme_jomps> and then expand from there
[02:49:12] <steme_jomps> so please correct me if I'm wrong or if I've misunderstood you
[02:49:18] <krambiorix> Cork, any idea?
[02:49:53] <Cork> steme_jomps: start by reading though ARIA and accustom your self to all the attributes you need from there
[02:49:57] <Cork> ?g mdn aria
[02:49:58] <b-ot> Cork: ARIA - Accessibility | MDN â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Accessibility/ARIA
[02:50:02] <steme_jomps> Cork: Alright, will do. Thanks a lot. :-)
[02:50:10] <Cork> steme_jomps: after that i would recommend NOT doing it for mobiles
[02:50:28] <Cork> they replace the element with browser specific ui, and you most likely can't make a better one there
[02:50:36] <steme_jomps> Cork: Well, my point is that if whatever platform turns out to be too much of an effort or a timesink, I'll just skip it
[02:50:42] <steme_jomps> and focus on a different platform
[02:50:43] <steme_jomps> :-)
[02:50:46] <steme_jomps> So no argument there.
[02:51:00] <Cork> steme_jomps: just make sure you don't skip it with "just use the default replacement look"
[02:51:01] <steme_jomps> though I'd argue that it's def. possible to make better UI
[02:51:10] <Cork> and remember ppl use forms without a mouse :)
[02:51:14] <Cork> and without a monitor
[02:51:37] <steme_jomps> Yeah, design is not an issue here. I can deal with all of that.
[02:51:43] <steme_jomps> I'm merely asking from a technical standpoint. :-)
[02:51:49] <steme_jomps> Appreciate all feedback though
[02:51:51] <Cork> steme_jomps: read through the problems and then use a screen reader on your replacement form elements
[02:52:03] <Cork> and when you've gotten there come and say that again :D
[02:52:14] <Cork> i doubt you will say the same thing :D
[02:52:58] <steme_jomps> Cork: I really don't see a problem with finding a way to make alternate UI while maintaining proper markup. It's just standard problem solving.
[02:53:12] <steme_jomps> You could use lists and anchors
[02:53:24] <steme_jomps> but the representation of the content can be entirely different
[02:53:31] <Cork> steme_jomps: the problem is interaction
[02:53:35] <steme_jomps> How so?
[02:53:36] <Cork> not design
[02:53:47] <Cork> i've already stated why
[02:53:57] <steme_jomps> I don't really understand what I'm being told here.
[02:54:08] <steme_jomps> I don't understand what I'm reading
[02:54:11] <steme_jomps> .Is what I mean.
[02:54:33] <Cork> but i seriously recommend you research how forms work from ALL perspectives
[02:55:01] <steme_jomps> So what you're telling me is that what, it's too hard to account for all the contexts in which forms are used?
[02:55:03] <Cork> and accessibility how form elements work on mobiles (including things like time, date, slide and the like)
[02:55:24] <Cork> steme_jomps: no not too hard, but you are limited to the website
[02:55:42] <steme_jomps> Alright. What do you mean by limited to the website?
[02:55:44] <steme_jomps> Limited how?
[02:55:56] <Cork> and what you can do there often means you will have to hack around limitations to not regress features in browsers
[02:56:10] <Cork> steme_jomps: like i said, mobile browsers replace form elements
[02:56:22] <Cork> they use a fullscreen overlays for select boxes
[02:56:29] <Cork> time pickers for time elements
[02:56:35] <Cork> calenders for date and so on
[02:56:52] <steme_jomps> Yeah but like I said, I'd start with a single platform and expand from there. If my solution doesn't work on mobile, I'll do a specific solution or skip it entirely
[02:56:54] <Cork> remember you will have to handle dragstart inpage if you replace that
[02:57:17] <Cork> steme_jomps: sure, but like i said, make sure you don't fall back to "same as default replacement"
[02:57:23] <Cork> default should be not replaced at all
[02:57:30] <krambiorix>  how can i catch the event of a draggable that hovers  a non droppable div?  In that event i want to make the draggable smaller in width...
[02:57:35] <steme_jomps> What do you mean by "same as default replacement"? :o
[02:57:39] <steme_jomps> Not quite following.
[02:58:12] <Cork> steme_jomps: the js should check "can i guarantee that i can handle this interface"
[02:58:21] <Cork> that is 100% guarantee
[02:58:25] <steme_jomps> Yes.
[02:58:28] <Cork> if that isn't yes; don't do anything
[02:58:33] <steme_jomps> Yes.
[02:58:36] <Cork> leave the default fields
[02:58:43] <steme_jomps> This is what I have been saying. :-/
[02:58:55] <steme_jomps> I'll replace what I can and have confirmed to be working via testing
[02:59:03] <Cork> steme_jomps: well we haven't really argued about that part
[02:59:04] <Tingle> anyone here use WampServer on windows?
[02:59:14] <Cork> i just pointed out that it has to be that way
[02:59:25] <krambiorix> anyone??
[02:59:33] <Cork> steme_jomps: and also i pointed out that most of the ones doing this fail at it
[02:59:58] <Cork> they aim for "good looks" and when that's done they go "i'
[03:00:03] <steme_jomps> Cork: Alright.
[03:00:03] <Cork> *they aim for "good looks" and when that's done they go "i'm done"
[03:00:13] <steme_jomps> Well, thanks for the info.
[03:00:20] <steme_jomps> I'll consider myself warned and informed. :-)
[03:00:46] <Cork> and also to save your self some time
[03:00:59] <Cork> like i said, start by research
[03:01:03] <Cork> don't start by coding
[03:01:24] <Cork> cause there is a ton of ways you can do it wrong
[03:01:34] <Cork> (and would then have to start over)
[03:02:12] <steme_jomps> Nah, what I'm doing is small scale.,
[03:02:21] <krambiorix> Cork, do you have 2 mins? :  how can i catch the event of a draggable that hovers  a non droppable div?  In that event i want to make the draggable smaller in width...
[03:02:55] <Cork> krambiorix: i haven't fiddled with the draggable ui plugin for quite a while
[03:03:14] <Cork> all i remember is that the events was not very intuitive
[03:03:22] <krambiorix> yeah
[03:04:35] <Snoopal> hey guys im using margin: 0px auto; to center an image
[03:07:01] <krambiorix> Cork, or you know howw to get the draggable element when using  $('#mynondroppable').hover(function() {});   ?
[03:10:18] <Snoopal> when i do an animation the element gets display: inline. but i need display: block; that it works
[03:16:45] <Cork> krambiorix: if you have a placeholder/ghost when you drag something you don't get hover
[03:16:52] <Cork> cause the overlay is under the cursor
[03:17:26] <Cork> Snoopal: what is the animation?
[03:17:40] <Cork> Snoopal: most likely it is cause you set display: none; in css
[03:17:56] <krambiorix> Cork, the  droppable is a child of the non droppable ...
[03:18:11] <Cork> Snoopal: if that indeed is correct, use .hide() in .ready instead, and leave the css with the correct value
[03:18:45] <Cork> krambiorix: sorry i don't have draggable/droppable fresh enough in memory
[03:19:02] <krambiorix> Cork, i'll make a jsfiddle, maybe it will ring a bell
[03:30:37] <[E]sc> i've written a script to load user content dynamically via an infinite scroll.  What's the best way to handle how the new content is retrieved? Should I use an anchor and retrieve data where the content < anchor id? or retrieve all content right away and then load each part.  Currently I'm using an anchor where the last id is returned to the server and checked.
[03:34:09] <Cork> [E]sc: you could store the number of "elements" you've added
[03:34:17] <Cork> and then use it as an offset for the request
[03:34:45] <Cork> like ex. first you show 50 when you hit the end you load an additional 50 so the index is 100
[03:34:47] <Cork> and so on
[03:37:22] <[E]sc> Cork, thanks. I'm currently using that method, and storing the data in the html <UL data-id="123">. I've seen scripts use that method before, would that be the best way? or using $_SESSION variable (i'm using php) be better?  I'm afraid someone might manipulate the <UL> data tag;
[03:37:57] <Cork> [E]sc: would the page "break" if they modify the value?
[03:38:01] <Cork> or just skip a few posts?
[03:38:53] <Cork> session isn't really an option, cause that would break if the user opens more then one tab
[03:39:24] <abishek> could someone advice on a working debounce jquery plugin similar to http://benalman.com/code/projects/jquery-throttle-debounce/examples/debounce/ that works with the latest version of jquery
[03:41:04] <[E]sc> if the user changed the data-id to 1000 from 40, but there's only 50 results, and the i've already loaded 10, the script would reload those previous 10 results. and then it'll change the data-id=40; back to the previous value.
[03:53:06] <Snoopal> cork: thank you for your hint with hide();!!!!!! you made my day! :)
[03:53:44] <Cork> [E]sc: so it would show some extra/missing data
[03:54:03] <Cork> [E]sc: i don't see that as something problematic, as long as they do have access to that data
[03:54:15] <Cork> (and that should be limited server side anyway)
[03:54:22] <Ericx2x> can anyone recommend a lightbox jquery download?
[03:56:03] <Ericx2x> free for commerical use too*
[03:56:37] <[E]sc> Cork, thanks.  I was worried because i was able to manipulate the data and wanted to see if there was something was missing / wrong with my script.
[03:57:06] <Cork> [E]sc: if you inspect the dom and remove elements the page can break too
[03:57:19] <Cork> not exactly a "bug" in the page code ;)
[03:58:03] <[E]sc> Cork, great thanks! that was going to be my next question haha
[03:58:40] <Cork> [E]sc: what you need to make sure is that the data server side doesn't becomes wrong
[03:59:20] <xqo> hi, when i want to shrink a window, i do M-x shrink-window
[03:59:28] <xqo> but i have to do it like 10 times in a row to get the size i want
[03:59:40] <xqo> can i do it many times automatically somehow?
[03:59:56] <Cork> xqo: don't think your in the correct channel
[04:00:03] <xqo> oh
[04:00:06] <xqo> no im not, haha thanks
[04:01:36] <[E]sc> Cork, thanks.  I hope i'm doing all I can to protect all the data coming in and out of the server.
[04:09:56] <xqo> i do this to animate something portlet.css("animation","webshop_cart_portlet_icon_shift 2s");, how can I delay the next line until the css-animation is complete?
[04:10:55] <Cork> ?mdn animationend
[04:10:55] <b-ot> Cork: animationend - Mozilla Developer Center â†’ https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Reference/Events/animationend
[04:11:34] <xqo> thank you
[04:32:50] <jammanbo> $('.dropzone').dragenter(callback) works, but how come $('body').on('dragenter, '.dropzone', callback) doesn't?
[04:32:59] <CrysAk> Question : i have a confirm box with text too large for the page, is there a way to set overflow:scroll on these (i checked css and css doens;t affect alert boxes apprently) any ideas?
[04:33:43] <Cork> CrysAk: you mean a native confirm box?
[04:33:50] <jammanbo> CrysAk: Use a popup/alertbox/lightbox plugin?
[04:34:03] <Cork> james_woods: might be it doesn't bubble
[04:34:29] <Cork> uh...
[04:34:30] <Cork> opps
[04:34:34] <Cork> jammanbo: ^
[04:34:50] <CrysAk> Cork, james_woods  yup, native alert/confirm box via jquerys confirm() function
[04:35:09] <CrysAk> it's for admin controls so doesn;t have to be pretty, if there's no overflow option/scroll option i'l jsut live with it
[04:35:25] <jammanbo> Cork: Yeah, it's looking that way ...
[04:35:28] <Cork> CrysAk: ya, you can't style alerts and confirm boxes
[04:35:51] <Cork> jammanbo: you could add a customevent to force it to bubble
[04:36:11] <Cork> (check in jquery migration if you want some examples of how you do this)
[04:36:39] <usc9111> Hey guys, any way to stop a page reloading when I exit a fancybox using a blank link?
[04:36:45] <CrysAk> Cork,  thanks .. never mind :(
[04:37:18] <Cork> usc9111: don't use broken links?
[04:38:02] <jammanbo> Cork you mean jquery-migrate?
[04:38:44] <Cork> jammanbo: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/blob/master/src/event.js#L113
[04:39:47] <usc9111> cork: its just a <a href"#">
[04:39:58] <Cork> usc9111: ya, and that is a broken link
[04:40:07] <usc9111> what should I be using instead?
[04:40:22] <Cork> any element you like that doens't have a specific click meaning
[04:40:32] <Cork> <span class="link"></span> for example
[04:40:55] <Cork> then add the link style on them if you want them to look like a link
[04:42:22] <usc9111> hmm ok cheers
[04:44:28] <netiul> is there an alternate way to instantiate a widget?
[04:44:39] <martisj> parallax scrolling like this page http://srgint.com/ anyone?
[04:44:52] <netiul> instead directly to an element like element.autocomplete();
[04:45:28] <jammanbo> Thanks Cork. The special events API is news to me, but given that the intention is to automatically bind to newly added .dropzones, am I better off using .delagate()?
[04:45:59] <jammanbo> I'd need to use it anyway right to achieve the fake bubbling?
[04:46:13] <Cork> jammanbo: what i meant was you can use special to make it trigger on document for example
[04:46:27] <Cork> jammanbo: as it doens't bubble (apparently) you can't use delegate
[04:49:37] <crane> hi, does this script looks valid for you? http://pastebin.com/AdT6jhEt firebug says it is worng in line 1 and he is missing a ; but i dont see it.
[04:50:12] <Cork> crane: no
[04:50:23] <Cork> crane: you create a function but you don't store it
[04:50:32] <Cork> (line 1)
[04:50:52] <crane> Cork, just as a note... i'm a beginner with jquery and js ;)
[04:53:00] <jammanbo> I'm confused I'm afraid â€¦ Does the special event add method get automagically called every time a new .dropzone is inserted into the DOM, and from there I bind my handlers to it?
[04:53:50] <Cork> jammanbo: it is called when ever an event handler is added, and an element is removed
[04:54:07] <Cork> i think there is a trigger function too
[04:55:41] <jammanbo> Right, but then I still have no way of automatically binding a dragevent handler when a new target is inserted into the DOM? To be clear, my hope was to be able to use `on' to define a handler for however many .dropzones might come and go after the DOM has been loaded.
[04:56:00] <jammanbo> (Sorry if I'm being thick)
[04:57:47] <Cork> jammanbo: hmm, ya, special is for the other way around
[04:57:55] <Cork> might be a tough one to solve
[04:58:14] <crane> Cork, this way? :) http://pastebin.com/TBV3sJXk
[04:58:14] <Cork> jammanbo: look for a bug in jquery ui about bubbling that event
[04:58:26] <Cork> crane: yes
[04:58:30] <Cork> that is valid
[04:59:21] <crane> Cork, yeah! thx for the hint :)
[05:00:00] <jammanbo> wait!
[05:00:58] <jammanbo> no, that's not it. Damn. Food.
[05:23:00] <Asmooh> W00T i have BBM for Android APK File O-)
[05:29:29] <joshAnderson99> disconnected. so might have missed response.
[05:39:03] <jonkri> i'm a little confused. i have div#outer and div#inner. i set $('div#outer').hover() to move and reposition the inner div. this works fine in firefox, but in ie i have to hover the inner div. anyone have a guess about what's going on here?
[05:55:36] <mintux> why unload doesn't operate here http://jsfiddle.net/LPPTC/ ?
[06:01:26] <doug65536> What can I do to get all mouse events, when element.setCapture is undefined?
[06:01:42] <doug65536> events over iframes don't bubble
[06:03:58] <doug65536> I guess, a full screen overlay div that has opacity 0 would work, right?
[06:04:44] <mintux> $(window).unload( function () { alert("Bye now!"); } ); doesn't work for me
[06:12:12] <doug65536> yeah, overlay div worked
[06:30:06] <FinisRonin> is the current version of of jquery ui compatible with jquery 2.0?
[06:30:57] <joshAnderson99> would anyone know why in page source, onclick="$('div#downloadlinks7619506').load('download.php?file_id=7619506'), when manually appended to the domain, file2find.com as http://file2find.com/download.php?file_id=7619506, the result is just a page with the text "bok", rather than what it should be, or what i think it should be, which is a list of URLs?  could the php page be checking whether
[06:30:57] <joshAnderson99> the click occurred within the page, and if not, returns the nonsense "bok".
[06:32:04] <Woet> joshAnderson99: sounds like they are checking whether it's an ajax request or not
[06:32:25] <Woet> who do you care either way? unless you have permission to scrape their site, you shouldn't
[06:33:42] <doug65536> I did a site years ago where, when it detected stuff like that, it sent a page that said "Nice try"
[06:34:27] <joshAnderson99> not for purposes of financial gain, so ethically it's not wholely questionable.
[06:35:56] <boytoy_> i guess you could argue that if google can scrape sites for financial gain, why can't you?
[06:36:41] <boytoy_> that seems to hold in court as well at least for the "big corp that got scraped vs small team that did the scraping" ive come across
[06:37:01] <joshAnderson99> or router info broadcast into the street which some would consider unquestionably suspicious
[06:37:09] <boytoy_> * cases ive come across
[06:38:17] <joshAnderson99> and google isn't evil too
[06:38:49] <joshAnderson99> so that clears up ethical issues pretty well, just the technical one remains.
[06:40:01] <joshAnderson99> actually, another argument is that something like 15% percent or more, forgotten the figure, of all traffic is generated by spiders, checking out other people's stuff. i'm sure it's not all sanctioned.
[06:43:16] <[E]sc> i've written a script to dynamically add content to my page as the user scrolls down.  however, sometimes the script hangs and causes the content to be loaded twice or not at all unless i scroll back and and the down again to initiate the script. I've set an anchor tag to show were the last mysql content id left off.  any suggestions on how to fix this?
[06:51:43] <rjcousineau> hi, im trying to have a page scroll at a slow rate using animate({ scrollTop: val });  the problem is once the animation starts, any mouse scroll event doesn't stop the animation, the page seems to scroll regardless of user interruption.   I've managed to bind the event 'DOMMouseScroll mousewheel' which can detect mouse scroll, and i can stop() the animation.   The problem im having is I want
[06:51:43] <rjcousineau> the animation to begin again after a timeout period.. say 5 seconds.   If I trigger a startScroll() event on each mouse event, it builds up a series a multitude of timeouts and I was hoping to find a way to cancel the timeout and start from 0 instead of having many simultanious timeouts
[07:05:59] <FinisRonin> is the current version of of jquery ui compatible with jquery 2.0?
[07:07:05] <BillCriswell> FinisRonin: The website says 1.6+ so I'd imagine yes.
[07:10:30] <boytoy_> At http://jsfiddle.net/od1999/dpxvG/1/ using https://github.com/dcneiner/In-Field-Labels-jQuery-Plugin -- how do I start with a blinking cursor after "Lorem" like in Gmail compose's "To"?
[07:10:34] <boytoy_> I reckon users would like that more.
[07:15:11] <mls_> hi there
[07:15:40] <mls_> is there a way to do a jQuery(selector).on([list of events],...) ?
[07:16:09] <doug65536> mls_: yes, space separated
[07:16:24] <mls_> or how to nicely attach many events to the same object, with the same callback ?
[07:16:46] <mls_> doug65536: nice thanks
[07:16:48] <krambiorix> hi, is it possible to set the offset top of a draggable element  when over a droppable ?
[07:16:49] <doug65536> mls_: on('mousedown mousemove', function(event) { switch(event.type) { case 'mousemove' ... }
[07:16:55] <mls_> was not documented on jquery website
[07:18:36] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: Why not just do <label>To:</label> <input>? You can style the input without a border and you don't need the plugin or anything.
[07:19:14] <grafi> I dont like your efficient solutions to stuff BillCriswell
[07:19:16] <grafi> :P
[07:19:27] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: Which, just checking it out, is what gmail seems to do.
[07:19:50] <grafi> So technically you could start working at google now
[07:20:24] <BillCriswell> grafi: I'm practically there. Just need to get this Algebra thing figured out.
[07:20:40] <grafi> Algewhat? ^^
[07:20:57] <r3v3rb> anyone have any idea why on one page jquery ketchup plugin works perfectly yet on an identical page it returns TypeError: $.fn.ketchup is undefined
[07:21:36] <BillCriswell> r3v3rb: Thinking you just forgot to include ketchup on the other page
[07:21:55] <r3v3rb> BillCriswell: I wish but its there and loaded in FireBug
[07:22:03] <r3v3rb> its bizarre
[07:22:33] <grafi> bzz bzzz
[07:22:44] <BillCriswell> r3v3rb: Not sure then. Would need to see that page.
[07:22:51] <r3v3rb> sure
[07:26:57] <boytoy_> grafi: haha
[07:26:59] <Cork> r3v3rb: make sure you only have one version of jquery in the page
[07:27:14] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: thats great man thanks for everything :p
[07:27:23] <BillCriswell> No problem!
[07:28:11] <grafi> That'll be $145,67 would you like to pay cash?
[07:28:37] <boytoy_> =)
[07:30:08] <r3v3rb> Cork: okay I'll double check
[07:30:41] <Cork> r3v3rb: and when your at it; that ketchup is included after jquery
[07:30:56] <r3v3rb> Cork: seems to be that way
[07:31:03] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: http://jsbin.com/oHOCizo/1/edit?html,css,js,output here is what I'm thinking?
[07:31:20] <r3v3rb> jquery 1.10.1 then ketchup
[07:31:24] <boytoy_> huh what kinda url is that?
[07:31:41] <BillCriswell> jsbin, but it only shows certain panels.
[07:31:43] <boytoy_> nice BillCriswell
[07:32:05] <grafi> all panels you mean? ^^
[07:32:25] <BillCriswell> Good point.
[07:32:40] <grafi> Im unhappy
[07:32:44] <grafi> Dexter is crappy
[07:32:46] <grafi> ...
[07:32:47] <boytoy_> BillCriswell: you forgot to make it pretty though: * { font-family: "Comic Sans MS", "Impact", sans-serif; background: green; }
[07:33:04] <BillCriswell> boytoy_: The website beautifier.
[07:33:10] <grafi> background: black; color: hackergreen;
[07:33:12] <grafi> plz
[07:33:15] <boytoy_> :D
[07:33:37] <BillCriswell> Just noticed the codecast option in jsbin. Think I know what that does.
[07:34:04] <grafi> woot
[07:34:06] <grafi> where
[07:34:20] <BillCriswell> Share > Codecast
[07:34:29] <grafi> Awesomesauce
[07:34:33] <grafi> lets try it
[07:34:36] <grafi> :D
[07:35:25] <mls_> I don't know which even/object I should listen on the input type text I use with datepicker in order to know when input has changed. I was listening to input text on blur and change, but it seems the field loose focus before the datepicker change the value (so not usefull), and that datepicker manages to change the value of the input w/o firing a change event on the input text. Any idea ?
[07:35:37] <BillCriswell> haha ok
[07:35:42] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/oHOCizo/1/watch?html,css,js,output
[07:36:03] <BillCriswell> I image it'll tell me if someone is viewing it?
[07:36:28] <grafi> I have it open right now
[07:36:53] <BillCriswell> Hmmm...
[07:36:57] <boytoy_> me too
[07:37:08] <grafi> works great apparently :D
[07:37:36] <BillCriswell> I should read the help
[07:38:06] <grafi> what does it say?
[07:38:08] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/HqsWF/2/
[07:38:14] <andrew9183> need some help with writing a simple jquery plugin
[07:38:28] <andrew9183> how do i call a function within the plugin?
[07:40:03] <shwaiil> Q: Tricky question. I'm using Isotope (Masonry Comercial version by Desandro). Testing the reLayout method by using the example provided here (http://isotope.metafizzy.co/demos/relayout.html), copied the css, js to (http://punkbit.com/webzine/isotope.html) but when I click in the first element all other elements go to the first column. I wonder why ? It's hte same code! Thanks!
[07:41:24] <BillCriswell> andrew9183: http://jsfiddle.net/HqsWF/3/ like this?
[07:41:50] <BillCriswell> I called .clear() in .init()
[07:42:07] <ggdevelop> i having herf inside dialog function and i want to set a new parameter to the url, at the first time its work but at the second its still hold the previus value,                                                                                              $('<a />', {'target': '_blank','style': 'padding:8px;','class': 'ui-button ui-widget ui-state-default ui-corner-all ui-button-text-only', text: 'print', href:'printTable.phpprint=1
[07:43:53] <andrew9183> ah, how would I call it outside the init function
[07:44:01] <andrew9183> ie if I wanted to do $.blunder('clear');
[07:44:20] <doug65536> shwaiil: good question
[07:45:10] <shwaiil> doug65536: Thanks for looking! I've been trying to figure this out. Started by using Masonry, now testing Isotope and stopped using my code and now using the one provided in the example, but no, doesn't work. I wonder why.
[07:45:26] <shwaiil> if I do click in the second element, works nicely.
[07:46:37] <doug65536> shwaiil: try setting a layoutMode
[07:46:48] <shwaiil> doug65536: I'll do
[07:47:04] <doug65536> shwaiil: http://isotope.metafizzy.co/docs/layout-modes.html
[07:51:13] <shwaiil> doug65536: tested different layouts without success
[07:51:47] <shwaiil> I've also have this example, using masonry, doing the exact same thing: http://codepen.io/anon/pen/BKAdH
[07:51:55] <shwaiil> if clicked in the first element it won't work
[07:52:41] <rjcousineau> what default easing strings are available in core jquery 1.10?
[07:53:12] <rjcousineau> nm, just swing, and linear
[07:53:17] <doug65536> rjcousineau: linear, and swing
[08:10:55] <BillCriswell> andrew9183: I'm sorry about the delay. I think the answer here is pretty good with the explanation: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1117086/how-to-create-a-jquery-plugin-with-methods
[08:11:13] <andrew9183> okay thanks BillCriswell
[08:11:17] <amcsi_work> hi
[08:12:00] <amcsi_work> does anyone have any ideas on why a form won't submit in jQuery 1.6.1 when calling submit on it? Note that there are no events bound to it. Source: $('#form').data('events') is empty
[08:12:06] <BillCriswell> andrew9183: http://jsfiddle.net/styu/NwZZd/ this demo down in the commets also explains how to do it. I don't have enough experience making my own plugins to really say which way I'd go design wise to be honest.
[08:14:55] <doug65536> andrew9183: you read this right? http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/
[08:16:45] <doug65536> andrew9183: generally, your plugin is wrapped in (function($) { ... }(jQuery));    The ... part can have functions and variables that are only in your plugin code's scope. You generally store out one of those functions to $.fn.something near the end.
[08:16:53] <BillCriswell> doug65536: I've never seen this. =/
[08:17:28] <andrew9183> me either, thanks for the link
[08:17:36] <andrew9183> http://jsfiddle.net/HqsWF/4/
[08:17:47] <andrew9183> i kind of figured it out, but not sure why the text doesn't change on the show method, any idae
[08:17:58] <doug65536> andrew9183: once you understand the basics, read http://learn.jquery.com/plugins/advanced-plugin-concepts/
[08:19:32] <BillCriswell> Hmm... I've read this one. Always skipping shit.
[08:19:42] <doug65536> :)
[08:21:34] <doug65536> andrew9183: for fun I made an event debounce plugin. It demonstrates keeping track of data for multiple elements and managing namespaced events http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/EMhCt/
[08:22:02] <andrew9183> wow, thank you doug65536 ! you've been tremendous help
[08:22:07] <andrew9183> can't wait to read the resources
[08:23:39] <andrew9183> i found my mistake ! :)
[08:28:51] <ggdevelop> i have a jquery dialog buttons and i want to clear theme before i  build them, can i do that?
[08:31:43] <andrew9183> so i have this now: http://jsfiddle.net/HqsWF/5/ but i don't have a reference to this.options.errorColor  in the error method...
[08:56:46] <thrustcore> I noticed that datepicker doesn't have any events, how do I register a callback so that when the user changes the date it has some external effect?
[09:00:07] <doug65536> thrustcore: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-onSelect
[09:00:31] <doug65536> thrustcore: I think...
[09:00:51] <thrustcore> doug65536: maybe I misunderstood this method, I thought onSelect is called when you select the datepicker, not when you pick a date, I might be wrong
[09:01:23] <doug65536> thrustcore: read the description though. To me, it reads that it calls it with the selected date, 'this' is the input field
[09:02:10] <doug65536> thrustcore: it must be. they can't be that dumb
[09:02:53] <io______> hi i want ot check for browser size and change a background image accordingly, is using if sentences a good way, or is it better to store values in arrays and check against them, or any other suggestion? http://pastebin.com/Zb1DdTNk
[09:03:09] <ternes3> Hi! Is it possible to replace a replaced div? Like First $('#content_an').replaceWith('<p>Hi</p>'); Second (in a other function): $('#content_an').replaceWith('<p>Lalala</p>');
[09:03:12] <ternes3> ?
[09:03:17] <shoky> andrew9183: your main plugin method was kinda off  http://jsfiddle.net/HqsWF/6/
[09:03:45] <doug65536> thrustcore: I took a guess that they would fire a 'change' event (using .trigger) when you pick a date. I stumbled upon onSelect when I was looking for that
[09:05:05] <thrustcore> but where do I put my $.post() then?
[09:05:21] <doug65536> thrustcore: onSelect is a callback
[09:05:30] <doug65536> thrustcore: you set it with a function
[09:05:30] <thrustcore> 'onSelect' : function() { $.post(...) ?
[09:05:38] <doug65536> yeah
[09:05:52] <thrustcore> but what about the dateText and inst parameters, shouldn't that function take those parameters?
[09:05:58] <doug65536> yes
[09:06:17] <thrustcore> maybe eclipse is just derping at me, it's telling me something about the left hand needing to be a variable..
[09:06:51] <thrustcore> oh my bad, it should be datepicker().onSelect { ...
[09:07:21] <doug65536> thrustcore: $(something).datepicker({onSelect: function(dateText, element) { ... }})
[09:08:18] <doug65536> thrustcore: I think. the examples suck for datepicker :|
[09:08:27] <thrustcore> yeah I'll try and figure it out
[09:08:32] <thrustcore> I'm not really a js boss
[09:08:57] <doug65536> thrustcore: $(something).datepicker('option', 'onSelect', function(dateText, element) { ... });    <-- that will definitely work
[09:09:33] <thrustcore> so what do I put in option?
[09:09:38] <thrustcore> should it be the literal 'option' ?
[09:09:40] <doug65536> yes
[09:09:43] <doug65536> literal
[09:11:37] <doug65536> thrustcore: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/vf8ZG/1/
[09:12:05] <thrustcore> nice, thank you
[09:13:10] <thrustcore> is there a jquery "typeOf" operator?
[09:13:33] <thrustcore> so that I can get the data type of the result? It says Date but http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Date shows nothing about date
[09:13:39] <shoky> ternes3: those $('#content_an') will only work if there is a #content_an element in the DOM
[09:13:57] <lpapp> hi, is it simple to draw a busy indicator with jquery?
[09:14:10] <lpapp> provided, I can also draw a "Please wait.. loading" custom text?
[09:14:14] <lpapp> say, for a form submit.
[09:14:16] <doug65536> thrustcore: javascript has typeof, but it gives you "string", "object", "number", "undefined", etc
[09:14:16] <shoky> thrustcore there's $.type
[09:14:35] <doug65536> thrustcore: it's a javascript Date
[09:14:45] <thrustcore> doug65536: it tells me it's a string
[09:15:02] <thrustcore> that's fine, I'm sure there's an easy way to convert it into a java.util.Date in java
[09:15:02] <doug65536> thrustcore: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date
[09:15:11] <ternes3> shoky: Yes ther ist a element in the DOM but it works only once :(
[09:15:34] <shoky> ternes3: after you replace it with a <p>Hi</p>  there is no longer an element in the DOM matching #content_an because you've just removed it
[09:15:44] <shoky> well, assuming you don't have duplicate ID's
[09:16:01] <doug65536> thrustcore: nearly useless, but: http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#method-getDate
[09:16:09] <doug65536> it doeshn't say what it returns :(
[09:16:27] <thrustcore> it says it returns date but as previously stated, http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Date doesn't have a Date type
[09:16:49] <doug65536> thrustcore: I already told you, Date is a javascript type
[09:16:58] <doug65536> thrustcore: jquery is just a javascript library you know
[09:17:04] <ternes3> shoky: hmm that sounds logical ;D What can i do to fix it?
[09:17:07] <thrustcore> I know
[09:17:11] <thrustcore> but it doesn't actually return a date
[09:17:22] <thrustcore> dateText.getDay() for example, doesn't execute
[09:17:24] <Bloomberg> guy!!
[09:17:27] <ternes3> shoky: or what can i do that it work
[09:17:27] <Bloomberg> guys!!*
[09:17:42] <shoky> ternes3:  var p = $('<p>Hi</p>');   $('#content_an').replaceWith( p );      p.replaceWith( whatever );   etc
[09:17:54] <Bloomberg> how can I set the div of day view of fullcallendar for it be scrollable
[09:18:39] <shoky> ternes3: or if you want.. give the p an id="content_an"  and then $('#content_an') will find it..
[09:18:39] <ternes3> shoky: ok thanks ;) I will try it directly.
[09:18:50] <doug65536> thrustcore: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/vf8ZG/2/
[09:18:53] <ternes3> shoky: ok
[09:19:06] <doug65536> thrustcore: that's a real "Date" object
[09:19:35] <thrustcore> ah I see
[09:19:40] <doug65536> thrustcore: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/vf8ZG/3/
[09:21:45] <doug65536> DRY http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/vf8ZG/4/
[09:22:20] <lpapp> has anyone seen my question?
[09:23:06] <doug65536> lpapp: well, there is probably a library... or you could make a fixed div and .show() .hide() it
[09:23:18] <finnnnnnnnnnn> elli, is there a way to go to a nth sibling after am element? something like $('myDiv').next(3) - which would take you to the the third next sibling?
[09:23:59] <doug65536> lpapp: and a fixed position top left bottom right 0px div with .5 opacity and black, with a lower z-index than the "please wait" div... or something :)
[09:24:32] <ternes3> shoky: huhu thanks it work ;D
[09:24:34] <shoky> finnnnnnnnnnn: .nextAll().eq(2)
[09:24:44] <finnnnnnnnnnn> shoky: thanks
[09:26:04] <lpapp> doug65536: that is chinese to me. :)
[09:26:26] <lpapp> I kinda hoped for someone having written one already, and others can simply reuse it.
[09:26:33] <lpapp> as it is a pretty common use case in the web world.
[09:29:25] <NoiseEee> lpapp: this is a place where we help people with their code, not do things for them
[09:30:14] <lpapp> NoiseEee: I have no any code... I would like to reuse a reusable functionality ... I think you missed that very point.
[09:30:32] <NoiseEee> lpapp: so, start making some code and we'll help you when you have issues
[09:31:49] <lpapp> NoiseEee: I think you do not make sense.
[09:31:58] <lpapp> I cannot make code without a reusable component found.....
[09:32:25] <lpapp> I will not rewrite something for the sake of rewriting. I do not have NIH syndrome.
[09:33:25] <shoky> divs are very reusable
[09:33:52] <lpapp> div != busy indicator
[09:34:07] <shoky> if you lack imagination
[09:34:44] <lpapp> how productive comment
[09:34:53] <NoiseEee> lpapp: you're essentially showing/hiding a <div>.  including a script as a plugin for such a thing is not very efficient.
[09:35:23] <lpapp> I have no idea what the second part is supposed to mean.
[09:35:42] <NoiseEee> well i hope you familiarize yourself with javascript and/or jquery soon!  best of luck lpapp.
[09:36:19] <lpapp> I hope I find more helpful people.
[09:37:35] <NoiseEee> lpapp: s/helpful people/suckers
[09:38:00] <NoiseEee> lpapp: what is not helpful? you're looking for a written script that you can plug in and make work without writing anything?  try googling.  this is not the place.
[09:38:19] * lpapp will ignore that
[09:39:26] <doug65536> <-- sucker http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/zaPde/5/
[09:41:04] <lpapp> doug65536: clearly, that is not an animated busy indicator.
[09:41:22] <lpapp> http://fgnass.github.io/spin.js/ -> not in any way close to this.
[09:41:25] <doug65536> lpapp: not good enough for you?
[09:41:26] * shoky facepalm
[09:41:32] <lpapp> I have been told to switch to jquery, but it seems even more painful. :'(
[09:41:53] <shoky> go away
[09:42:00] <lpapp> doug65536: I do not think that is good enough for any modern website.
[09:42:14] <doug65536> lpapp: no, YOU are not good enough for any modern website
[09:42:46] <lpapp> please stay civil.
[09:42:58] <jedimind> YOURE A MODERN WEBSITE
[09:44:03] <doug65536> lpapp: if you weren't so lazy you would realize that what I showed you solves half of your problem: not letting the user click on stuff while the operation is in progress. I'm not going to sit here and make it beautiful for you
[09:44:30] <lpapp> you are not obliged to help, but you should not insult others.
[09:44:36] <lpapp> just because "you do not have more time"
[09:45:02] <NoiseEee> lpapp: if you're unable to extrapolate doug65536 code into yours, then you need to learn javacript and jquery.
[09:45:07] <lpapp> leave it with others who already used busy indicators, which is I said, pretty common out there, so I am sure someone already used one, can provide example, etc.
[09:45:15] <NoiseEee> lpapp: jquery is not some "let me paste this and shit works!"
[09:45:28] <NoiseEee> examples are above.
[09:45:49] <doug65536> lpapp: find an animated gif you like, replace the message with an img tag. if that's beyond your capabilities, then I would suggest not trying to make it look good
[09:45:54] <lpapp> I cannot imagine jquery would be that silly that even a super common busy indicator requires a tons of study, learning, etc
[09:46:11] <NoiseEee> no but it requires basic knowledge.
[09:46:13] <NoiseEee> have you got that?
[09:46:29] <NoiseEee> or are you completely unaware of how to code JS?
[09:46:38] <lpapp> stop the personal insults, please.
[09:46:42] <lpapp> I wrote tons of js code.
[09:46:55] <NoiseEee> so then walk me through the concept of what you want to do
[09:46:59] <NoiseEee> what might your task involve?
[09:47:04] <lpapp> you are not doing anything else with such comments than being hostile, which does not make any good for anyone.
[09:47:41] <NoiseEee> i'm not being hostile, you're coming off as someone who is seeking someone else to do their work / looking for a magic pasteable solution.  again, google for that.  this is a channel to help people with THEIR code
[09:47:45] <lpapp> as I already wrote several times, I would like to have a busy indicator component.
[09:48:15] <NoiseEee> write, and what is that?  in basics?
[09:48:30] <NoiseEee> lpapp: would you agree that it would involve showing/hiding a DOM element or more?
[09:48:35] <lpapp> yeah, using reusable free software components made for others is yes, demanding others do your work
[09:48:41] <lpapp> well, it deserves an ignore for me.
[09:48:47] <lpapp> I had enough of that.
[09:48:53] <NoiseEee> lpapp: lol gfy
[09:49:02] <NoiseEee> good luck, please never come back here again asking for "help"
[09:49:06] <doug65536> ask in #writeMyCodez4Me
[09:49:08] <NoiseEee> you should try google.
[09:51:32] <lpapp> back to the technical point: has anyone used a busy indicator? Is there a reusable component with jquery like that spin.js?
[09:51:59] <lpapp> Any examples out there for such a component, like with spin.js?
[09:52:23] <shoky> lpapp: go through that spin.js page..
[09:52:44] <shoky> or did you mean you don't like spin.js
[09:52:57] <lpapp> I do not like it, otherwise I would not be here...
[09:53:13] <lpapp> it is only an animation after all without even a basic text such as "Loading. Please wait..."
[09:53:16] <Patabugen> How can I programtically create a Collapsible Set with jQuery mobile?
[09:53:31] <lpapp> and that is a blocker for me against using it.
[09:53:38] <shoky> wow.
[09:53:43] <doug65536> Patabugen: like http://jqueryui.com/accordion/
[09:53:45] <lpapp> I have been told to use jquery because that is "super cool"
[09:53:55] <lpapp> yet, I cannot find any reusable component with such feature requests.
[09:54:31] <doug65536> Patabugen: oops, you said mobile http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.2.0/docs/content/content-collapsible-set.html
[09:54:59] <shoky> lpapp: you won't get any better help in this channel
[09:55:12] <Patabugen> I've read that several times I'm afraid, there's no mention of doing it programtically, only through markup
[09:55:42] <lpapp> shoky: maybe not from you and some other people... let us not demotivate others though.
[09:55:56] <lpapp> you are not obliged to help, but you should not discourage others either to help.
[09:55:57] <doug65536> Patabugen: yes because they assume you can create a document fragment with $("...markup.."), insert it into the dom, and call $(something).trigger('create')
[09:56:20] <Patabugen> ahh, I wasn't aware I could do that! (Trigger the 'create'). I'll give it a go!
[09:56:30] <lpapp> shoky: just stay silent if you do not have anything productive to add.
[09:56:32] <Patabugen> Lpapp, are you after something which is not a plugin, or would a plugin do?
[09:56:52] <doug65536> Patabugen: yeah, triggering 'create' on a parent will walk the children and setup jqm stuff on them
[09:56:53] <lpapp> Patabugen: I kinda hoped for being available by default inside jquery.js
[09:57:05] <lpapp> Patabugen: a few people told me it would be muuuuch simpler with jquery rather than spin.js
[09:57:10] <lpapp> I do not see so far how.
[09:57:41] <Patabugen> jQuery mobile has something for it, but I don't know of something in regular jQuery. I have a plugin I wrote you're welcome to if you'd like it.
[09:58:26] <lpapp> Patabugen: http://jsfiddle.net/dannyfritz/PwKSZ/ -> I need something like this, but with "Please wait, loading..."
[09:58:49] <bigLanky> Currently on my site i have <div id="foo">Some Text</div> and I am trying to figure out how to write some jQuery so that I can take a PHP variable, and then sub it into that div instead of showing "Some text", the variable would take its place
[09:58:54] <bigLanky> can anyone point me in the right direction here?
[09:59:46] <doug65536> bigLanky: sounds like it has nothing to do with jquery: <div id="foo"><? echo $somePHPVariable; ?></div>
[09:59:59] <doug65536> bigLanky: or is it data from an ajax request?
[10:00:11] <bigLanky> yeah ajax
[10:00:42] <doug65536> bigLanky: $('#foo').text(ajaxdata);
[10:00:42] <bigLanky> so basically i have a webform... there is a field to enter your website... once website is entered, i want to take that and then load it as the <label> text for a different field
[10:02:21] <lpapp> Patabugen: got a clue?
[10:03:39] <doug65536> bigLanky: roughly like this with better layout? http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rqq6j/
[10:04:22] <doug65536> bigLanky: or do you mean actually "load" something from their website?
[10:04:49] <Patabugen> lpapp This is the plugin I use: http://jsfiddle.net/Dgw4C/
[10:05:20] <Patabugen> Which lets me do $('.something').loading() whever I want
[10:05:50] <Patabugen> and it'll replace the contents of .something with my loading thing (which usually gets replaced with the content when it's done loading)
[10:07:58] <lpapp> Patabugen: but this is a lot of boilerplate code
[10:08:08] <lpapp> and this does not even hide the image itself to have a "standard".
[10:08:29] <lpapp> I am really looking for something like the spin.js module above except the additional functionality such as custom text.
[10:08:56] * NoiseEee plays circus music in the background
[10:08:59] <bigLanky> doug65536: this is exactly what im looking for
[10:09:21] <lpapp> so, is there a more complete framework than js?
[10:09:29] <lpapp> something which provides proper UI controls off-hand?
[10:10:05] <lpapp> so, is there a more complete framework than jquery*?
[10:10:32] <lpapp> something which is useful for application developers, and apparently missing from jquery?
[10:10:33] <thrustcore> can anyone see what is wrong with my javascript? http://jsfiddle.net/
[10:10:34] <NoiseEee> like, something that might have everything you want to do without writing your own code?
[10:10:35] <thrustcore> damn it!
[10:10:42] <thrustcore> http://jsfiddle.net/d7caD/
[10:10:46] <doug65536> thrustcore: yes lol
[10:10:49] <grafi> I want that NoiseEee
[10:10:52] <grafi> give it to me
[10:11:03] <NoiseEee> available by ESP only
[10:11:13] <thrustcore> doug65536: lol I didn't realize to press 'save' first!
[10:11:38] <grafi> saving is always an option
[10:11:38] <lpapp> thrustcore: yes, it is a drawback of the site.
[10:11:42] <Patabugen> If you're going to pick your ibrary based on how easily you can display a spinner I'd suggest either your project is so simple you don't need a framework or you're priorities are amiss.
[10:11:55] <NoiseEee> thrustcore: whats not working?
[10:11:57] <doug65536> thrustcore: jquery doesn't like that selector
[10:12:11] <lpapp> Patabugen: any sane UI framework can do this on desktop, like Qt.
[10:12:17] <lpapp> it is such a core element....
[10:12:26] <NoiseEee> thrustcore: you'd need to pastebin the final, view-source, not PHP code included.
[10:12:30] <thrustcore> doug65536: so maybe I have to move the ${window.id} part of the selector and change the name or what?
[10:12:51] <thrustcore> NoiseEee: you mean localhost:8080/... and view-source of that?
[10:12:51] <doug65536> thrustcore: is that some templating system, or is that really the id?
[10:12:52] <lpapp> so yes, if core elements are missing, it is not unreasonable for asking a higher level framework with more thorough application support
[10:13:04] <NoiseEee> thrustcore: your code suggests an unfilled template/pHP/etc
[10:13:17] <lpapp> asking for*
[10:13:17] <NoiseEee> what is ${window.id} supposed to be?
[10:13:28] <Patabugen> Try Dojo, I found their widgets better when I tried it out a few years ago
[10:13:59] <thrustcore> http://jsfiddle.net/d7caD/1/ is this any better?
[10:14:16] <thrustcore> ${window.id} will automatically be replaced with the id, which is something like 0 or 29
[10:14:24] <NoiseEee> thrustcore: replaced by what?
[10:14:33] <thrustcore> by the id, which is something like 0 or 43
[10:14:37] <lpapp> Patabugen: what I do not understand why people told jquery would be better than spin.js
[10:14:42] <lpapp> likely obsessive people...
[10:14:51] <NoiseEee> those are terrible IDs, by the way thrustcore... also only valid in html5.  you should maybe use a class?
[10:15:16] <NoiseEee> thrustcore: so the element ID is suppsoed to be "0-datepickStart" ?
[10:15:17] <thrustcore> NoiseEee: well I'm just prototyping stuff right now, the id can be whatever, but at least it must work
[10:15:32] <thrustcore> NoiseEee: yes the id would look like that if the supplied id is 0
[10:15:53] <NoiseEee> thrustcore: and the current problem/error is?
[10:16:18] <thrustcore> NoiseEee: when I click the input box, no datepicker comes up
[10:16:20] <mintux> why $( window ).unload(function() {  alert( "Bye now!" );}); doesn't work i got this example from http://api.jquery.com/unload/
[10:16:21] <Patabugen> If you want to display a spinner and text, then jQuery is better than spin.js because spin.js cannot do that.
[10:16:50] <lpapp> Patabugen: nor can it do animation like spin.js
[10:16:54] <lpapp> which means inherently it is worse
[10:16:57] <shoky> Patabugen++
[10:17:15] <Patabugen> They're different tools for different jobs
[10:17:25] * NoiseEee turns up the circus music
[10:17:39] <lpapp> well, I need something higher level than jquery
[10:17:48] <lpapp> basically ui controls for html/js.
[10:18:16] <doug65536> thrustcore: I hacked it enough to work in jsfiddle http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/d7caD/4/
[10:18:36] <NoiseEee> thrustcore: i'd start prototyping another approach tbh
[10:18:41] <thrustcore> black magic!
[10:18:51] <NoiseEee> thrustcore: sensible ids, classes.
[10:19:01] <Patabugen> Here's a crazy idea: lpapp: http://jsfiddle.net/c2xcZ/1/
[10:19:22] <NoiseEee> Patabugen: BUT THAT HARDLY LOOKS PROFESSIONAL
[10:19:51] <shoky> all that boilerplate, too many options
[10:20:12] <shoky> so many comments
[10:20:17] <grafi> options are shit
[10:20:18] <grafi> :P
[10:20:54] <lpapp> Patabugen: as I said a few times, I do not use a div, nor do I wish.
[10:21:10] <NoiseEee> lol
[10:21:10] <Patabugen> Then you might need to write some code, or use the plugin I sent you
[10:22:08] <Patabugen> There's no reason you couldn't use spin.js instead of the image my plugin uses
[10:22:24] <lpapp> Patabugen: that does not show any image for me.
[10:22:26] <NoiseEee> but... isn't there something already done that works perfectly?
[10:22:33] <NoiseEee> without using a div?
[10:22:58] <grafi> computer says NO
[10:23:01] <Patabugen> lpapp, that's because it's designed to use an image on my site. You could easily replace the bit where I add an image with a spin.js bit of magic
[10:23:25] <lpapp> Patabugen: I do not understand why it is so complex.
[10:23:38] <lpapp> Patabugen: shouldn't just people be able to call a "showBusyIndicator" method and done?
[10:23:59] <lpapp> say, in the middle of the visible webpage area, with a sensible text, and animated image?
[10:24:12] <Patabugen> If you spent as much time writing code as you did complaining someone hadn't already done it, the next person with your problem could just download your plugin.
[10:24:12] <lpapp> and everyone else who wanna go crazy, can do their custom boilerplate hell.
[10:24:46] <lpapp> I think you are missing a fairly fundamental point.
[10:24:55] <lpapp> I am not a js framework developer, and faaaar from that.
[10:25:38] <Patabugen> Are you a JS developer?
[10:25:44] <NoiseEee> you don't need to design a framework, you have to write a function that shows/hides a fucking div with whatever content you want
[10:25:51] * NoiseEee turns up the circus music
[10:25:51] <louism2wash> Is there any performance difference between traversing the DOM via find a element and traversing downward using query's selector methods (find, closest, etc) versus just using complex selector statements ( $('#parent_element > #child_element:nth_child(3)')) ?
[10:25:54] <lpapp> Patabugen: no
[10:26:02] <lpapp> Patabugen: I am a hardcore asm/c/c++
[10:26:02] <doug65536> NoiseEee: lol
[10:26:23] <Patabugen> http://plugins.jquery.com/loader/
[10:26:38] <Patabugen> That plugin will do what you want
[10:27:27] <lpapp> Patabugen: it does not even have a screenshot how it looks like. :(
[10:27:38] <Patabugen> Try the "view demo" site
[10:27:41] <Patabugen> You put your own HTML in
[10:27:52] <doug65536> "loading" messages and/or spinners are unnecessary, users aren't that stupid, and if it really takes that long to do something, fix that instead of messing with ui bandaids
[10:27:53] <Patabugen> It's a less centralised version of my plugin
[10:28:40] <lpapp> Patabugen: I do not see any view demo link there.
[10:29:10] <thrustcore> hmm... it seems to work now, but I get an illegal invocation error, wonder where that comes from
[10:29:19] <Patabugen> on the right hand side
[10:29:24] <Patabugen> or hit Ctrl + F and type Demo
[10:30:04] <lpapp> Patabugen: you seem to have meant "Try Demo" rather than "View Demo"
[10:30:14] <ringo> louism2wash: yes, usually there are performance differences. there are websites that talk about it in more detail
[10:30:17] <lpapp> in any case, I do not see how that is improved
[10:30:28] <doug65536> thrustcore: are you using an older version of jquery? iirc, success and error are deprecated, you should use .done and .fail
[10:30:28] <lpapp> it is also only showing either a text, or an animated image.
[10:30:34] <lpapp> none of those is a progress to spin.js.
[10:30:46] <Patabugen> Lpapp: What you're asking is actually impossible to do.
[10:30:48] <louism2wash> ringo: thanks for the response.  Is there a general rule to go by or is it really case by case?
[10:30:52] <thrustcore> doug, I'm using an old version
[10:31:11] <Patabugen> You may need to learn some HTML and a splattering of JavaScript to make it happen
[10:31:17] <thrustcore> I'm actually working on another person's project right now, which is why I'm mostly in unfamiliar territory
[10:31:33] <lpapp> I do not see it as impossible, just a lot of boilerplate work.
[10:31:38] <ringo> there are some strategies, i guess, but it's easy to just read up on jquery performance and optimization
[10:31:51] <lpapp> what people have to rewrite, rewrite, and again rewrite...
[10:31:59] <ringo> there are some very basic things you can do that will improve code efficiency greatly
[10:32:00] <Patabugen> It's impossible to get a spinner which matches your specification without writing some code
[10:32:20] <doug65536> thrustcore: using placeholders in js looks suspicious. is that code in the html? or are you doing placeholder replacements on a js file?
[10:32:23] <lpapp> right, so jquery is not any better than spin.js then.
[10:32:25] <lpapp> so I can go back to it.
[10:32:43] <thrustcore> doug65536: the html and javascript are in one .jsp file
[10:32:49] <doug65536> thrustcore: ok
[10:33:03] <Patabugen> jQuery and spin.js have totally different goals. in jQuery it is possible to do as you wish, in spin.js it is not.
[10:33:52] <thrustcore> but how can I see where the illegal invocation is? This is why I don't really like javascript, it's not telling me where the problem is
[10:34:04] <lpapp> actually, with spin.js, it is also possible.
[10:34:11] <lpapp> with custom tweaking... you even pasted a customized version...
[10:34:15] <Patabugen> Excellent, then you're happy
[10:34:31] * lpapp has never said that, but quite the opposite
[10:34:48] <lpapp> I am sad that, the web is poor about ui controls.
[10:34:57] <lpapp> very common ui controls.
[10:35:00] <Patabugen> Well I'm not happy going round in circles with you anymore
[10:35:47] <lpapp> that does not mean you should put words into my mouth (like happiness)
[10:36:31] <lpapp> in any case, I will not show busy indicator to the users after a day of time waste.
[10:36:37] <lpapp> it is just very hard to do on the web
[10:38:37] <thrustcore> in my $.post:     		'sliderLeft': $(this).datepicker('getDate().getTime'), // error : Uncaught TypeError: Cannot call method 'apply' of undefined
[10:38:37] <thrustcore> what does this mean?
[10:39:19] <thrustcore> replacing the rhs with '0', doesn't give any errors
[10:39:27] <lpapp> thrustcore: there is no date picker ui control off-hand with jquery?
[10:39:44] <cek> gais, i've got some plugin that defines some func. I'd like to call that func directly. how do i do that?
[10:39:50] <thrustcore> lpapp: sorry, what does that mean in noob terms?
[10:39:54] <[MAN]> hey guys, could you please help me. How can I get original source code of this script ? http://torrent-scan.org/scripts/ce86bbb6.main.js any decoders ? as I understand it is minified version
[10:40:07] <thrustcore> I consider myself pretty much as a beginner in js
[10:40:23] <lpapp> thrustcore: well, for desktop ui frameworks, or even mobile, you usually have a date picker element you can reuse off-hand without writing the boiler plate.
[10:40:32] <thrustcore> [MAN]: get Sight for Chrome (extension), it'll deobfuscate it a bit for you
[10:40:45] <[MAN]> thrustcore, thanks I will try to google it
[10:40:58] <Patabugen> lpapp You want jQuery UI for a date picker
[10:41:01] <Patabugen> it's not in the jQuery core
[10:41:13] <thrustcore> yeah I have jquery ui 1.8.2 or so
[10:41:24] <thrustcore> 1.8.12, close
[10:41:25] <lpapp> Patabugen: where exactly did I say core?
[10:41:48] <Patabugen> Ah apologies, I mis-read your message and though you were asking for a datepicker
[10:43:07] <thrustcore> but lpapp, am I missing some control or something?
[10:43:09] <cek> func is defined in  (function ($, window) {  function THISFUNC(){} })(jQuery, window);. How do i call THISFUNC?
[10:43:59] <snover> you donâ€™t
[10:44:06] <lpapp> thrustcore: I do not know; I just saw you were working with date picker.
[10:44:14] <lpapp> thrustcore: I would not write one from scratch for sure.
[10:44:40] <lpapp> but it depends on your exact use case.
[10:46:15] <Patabugen> thrustcore: You may need to wrap that in a function(){} and return the value
[10:46:40] <cek> explain
[10:47:50] <lpapp> Patabugen: http://jsbin.com/ICOqeKi/1/edit
[10:48:45] <NoiseEee> can someone suggest lpapp hire a coder?
[10:48:58] <coldhead> lpapp: consider hiring a coder
[10:48:58] <Patabugen> That's about the same as the other plugin I send you, you didn't like the idea of writing a line of HTML
[10:49:21] <NoiseEee> thank you coldhead :)
[10:50:17] <[MAN]> thrustcore, great extension, but it does only syntax as I understand
[10:51:01] <lpapp> coldhead: I will not subcontract for you, so you need to consider someone else...
[10:51:22] <coldhead> we've all done things we're not proud of
[10:51:30] <thrustcore> [MAN]: did you try it?
[10:51:36] <Patabugen> I'm struggling to get .trigger('create') to work, I've tried calling it on the data-role="page" parent, the immediate parent and the item itself. Any thoughts?
[10:51:55] <Patabugen> I'm trying to dynamically create a collapsable-set with jQuery mobile
[10:52:05] <[MAN]> thrustcore, yes, I see black window with code formatted, but still minimized variable names like a,b,c... etc
[10:52:21] <thrustcore> well that's because the variable names don't exist
[10:52:43] <thrustcore> imagine you write a program with meaningful variables, then you open it in notepad and replace every instance of "numberOfApples" with "n"
[10:52:52] <thrustcore> you'll never be able to know what "n" used to be called
[10:53:10] <thrustcore> but what you can do is try and run it through a static analysis tool to compare it with other source code, but then you need the other source code to begin with lol
[10:53:28] <[MAN]> oh, understand
[10:53:42] <[MAN]> thanks anyway it is great tool wich I will use
[10:53:45] <cek> this channel is helpless
[10:53:56] <doug65536> [MAN]: if a "map" file is provided, it can be converted back
[10:53:59] <thrustcore> but [MAN], you should try replacing some of the variable names globally with stuff that is more meaningful
[10:54:08] <BillCriswell> cek: Why's that?
[10:54:11] <coldhead> ah, despair
[10:54:15] <cek> func is defined in  (function ($, window) {  function THISFUNC(){} })(jQuery, window);. How do i call THISFUNC?
[10:54:18] <thrustcore> so instead of p = filter, p_FILTER = filter or whatever
[10:54:22] <[MAN]> doug65536, do you mean source map ?
[10:54:27] <thrustcore> cek:  I don't think you can call THISFUNC
[10:54:27] <doug65536> [MAN]: yes
[10:54:37] <shoky> cek: you can't call it from outside, not without changing some code on the inside
[10:54:44] <[MAN]> how can I check if it exists
[10:55:09] <doug65536> [MAN]: look in the same place as the js file, but replace js with map
[10:55:20] <[MAN]> ok thanks
[10:55:38] <doug65536> [MAN]: it is to help make it debuggable - debuggers will auto-"unminifiy" if it is there
[10:55:42] <doug65536> -i
[10:55:49] <cek> strange that the code inside that jquery($, window) declaration can call it. Does jquery just wrap that in a separate context?
[10:55:51] <coldhead> cek: change function THISFUNC() { to window.THISFUNC = function () { and it will be available
[10:56:19] <BillCriswell> cek: It just exposes it.
[10:56:35] <cek> coldhead, won't that change the call method? it's used by some plugin
[10:56:36] <boolieman> hello there im having an issue passing a variable back to a parent function from a function that is called from multiple (a validation script idea) , what is the command to return the variable back, i tried return with the same variable name that was passed (error) from the parent, should i return simply as a different variable?
[10:56:55] <coldhead> cek: i'd try it and see, it MIGHT work anyway
[10:57:04] <cek> okk
[11:00:52] <boolieman> i have a quickly setup jsfiddle for the question i have http://jsfiddle.net/Fmu9L/
[11:00:58] <coldhead> thanks boolieman
[11:01:19] <boolieman> i truncated some of it but its basically the structure i have going on
[11:02:03] <coldhead> boolieman: http://jsfiddle.net/Fmu9L/1/
[11:02:07] <coldhead> line 16?
[11:02:26] <Patabugen> http://jsfiddle.net/tMHe6/ <-- Can anyone help me with getting dynamic collapsibles to work?
[11:02:55] <boolieman> wow thank you been playing tooo much in java lLOL
[11:04:46] <shoky> Patabugen: .data() doesn't modify the element attributes. use .attr()
[11:05:16] <shoky> Patabugen: or just $('<div data-role="collapsible">')
[11:05:39] <Patabugen> I thought .data() modified the elements data, which is what wants to be set here?
[11:05:57] <shoky> no, .data() only reads from the data-xxx attributes
[11:05:58] <Patabugen> The actual issue is with a collapsible set: http://jsfiddle.net/tMHe6/1/ since I Can't do .collapsibleSet()
[11:06:09] <Patabugen> ah, let me try that then
[11:06:48] <shoky> (it writes to an internal data cache that jquery manages)
[11:07:33] <Patabugen> Ahh beautiful! thanks!
[11:08:02] <Patabugen> So although you set those in the markup in data, which gets read into the internal data cache (unless I'm mistaken?) jQuery actually uses the attributes rather than the cache?
[11:08:30] <shoky> jquery-mobile uses the attributes rather than the cache (so it seems from this example - i don't really know)
[11:08:33] <snover> frankly you are better off using $.data
[11:08:37] <snover> $.fn.data is so dumb
[11:08:41] <snover> i warned people and it went in anyawy
[11:08:47] <Patabugen> What's wrong with it?
[11:09:04] <snover> the part where it consumes DOM attributes
[11:09:06] <Patabugen> hmm, using .data('theme', 'd') works
[11:09:33] <snover> itâ€™s not *for* dom attributes, itâ€™s to store JS objects on elements in a way that doesnâ€™t leak in old IE
[11:20:21] <Gandalf84> Hello
[11:22:08] <Gandalf84> I've developed a web app available for mobile devicesâ€¦ the thing is that is davy to load and sometimes it takes more than 1second to loadâ€¦and it doesn't give the looks of a native iOS app
[11:22:42] <Gandalf84> to avoid this I'm thinking to add a kind of loading bar on top, to let the user understand that something is going on when loadingâ€¦and understand the percentage of the process
[11:22:59] <Gandalf84> is it possible to show a percentage of loading of the next page with jquery?
[11:23:30] <Gandalf84> something that start in the moment in which an user click a linkâ€¦.and end when the next page is loaded?
[11:23:42] <boytoy_> which sounds better if you got a website that's also available as an android app: "For web and mobile", "For PC and mobile" or "For PC, Mac and mobile"?
[11:24:23] <Gandalf84> for desktop and mobile
[11:25:44] <doug65536> ^
[11:25:45] <boytoy_> Gandalf84: not sure the layman understands the meaning of the word "desktop"
[11:25:54] <boytoy_> Gandalf84: plus when you translate it into other languages it becomes even more ridiculous
[11:25:59] <NoiseEee> really boytoy_?
[11:26:03] <Gandalf84> ahahah
[11:26:08] <NoiseEee> i'd say more people understand 'desktop' than 'PC'
[11:26:11] <boytoy_> a desktop is literally a table on which you place your pc and keep all ya stacks of paper :p
[11:26:28] <boytoy_> NoiseEee: could be i dunno
[11:26:41] <doug65536> boytoy_: yeah, and a laptop is where you put a plate when you eat without a kitchen table :|
[11:26:42] <boytoy_> not sure mac users would understand 'PC' either
[11:26:51] <boytoy_> doug65536: tehe :p
[11:27:15] <boytoy_> laptop is a girl when she sits on your lap
[11:27:38] <doug65536> I think a "mobile" is where you put your clothes when you go to a hotel right? :|
[11:28:06] <NoiseEee> no, its that thing above childrens cribs
[11:28:06] <boytoy_> doug65536: didnt get that :p
[11:28:16] <doug65536> ah right, thanks
[11:28:45] <boytoy_> doug65536: my vocabulary isnt the strongest so
[11:29:03] <doug65536> yeah, english overloads words a lot
[11:29:27] <boytoy_> yup
[11:32:38] <doug65536> does anyone know off hand what happens if you urlencode null in an ajax post? $.post('', { foo: null }). does it end up the string "null" ?
[11:33:34] <NoiseEee> doug65536: i *think* it doesn't pass at all
[11:33:43] <NoiseEee> doug65536: check them tabs
[11:33:48] <shoky> empty string i think
[11:33:53] <shoky> foo=
[11:34:04] <foo> shoky: never!
[11:34:12] <doug65536> ok, thanks
[11:34:13] <shoky> ;p
[11:34:20] <Gandalf84> anybody can help me on my topic?
[11:34:38] <Patabugen> I'd go with for Desktop & Mobile
[11:37:37] <Lindrian> so I have a lot of elements on my website.... im trying to do $(".many_elements").show() or hide(), but since there are so many, i get "Maximum call stack size exceeded"
[11:37:39] <Lindrian> what to do?
[11:38:26] <NoiseEee> how many?
[11:38:33] <doug65536> fyi, shoky was right. null becomes foo=   (empty string)
[11:38:37] <NoiseEee> is that the true selector Lindrian?
[11:39:29] <Lindrian> NoiseEee: like.... 500k
[11:39:34] <doug65536> Lindrian: I find that hard to believe
[11:39:51] <NoiseEee> 500k elements on a single webpage you say?
[11:40:06] <BillCriswell> Sweet jesus.
[11:40:07] <NoiseEee> maybe time to re-read that sentence a few times
[11:40:18] <doug65536> what's the page load time? half an hour?
[11:40:47] <BillCriswell> div{Item $}*500000 weeee
[11:40:57] <Lindrian> nah page loads in a few seconds, its not that bad
[11:41:05] <Lindrian> most of the elements are display: none, so there's no real load on the browser
[11:41:27] <NoiseEee> Lindrian: right
[11:41:41] <BillCriswell> Lindrian: How about toggling a parents class instead? .parent.some-child-visible some-child { display: block; }
[11:41:48] <NoiseEee> Lindrian: sorry i can't see how that many elements on screen at once is in any way sensible
[11:42:08] <Lindrian> they arent on the screen at the same time
[11:42:12] <Lindrian> regardless thats not the problem at hand
[11:42:27] <doug65536> Lindrian: $('.many_elements').each(function() { $(this).show(); }) might be a workaround
[11:42:40] <Lindrian> ill give it a go
[11:43:01] <BillCriswell> I think I'd make CSS do the heavy stuff... I have no tests to back up how well it would work... but still
[11:43:05] <doug65536> Lindrian: although, that will probably cause a reflow for each one...
[11:43:23] <Lindrian> doug65536: the parents are display: none, so no reflow
[11:43:25] <Lindrian> or repaint
[11:43:29] <doug65536> Lindrian: you might want to have a div around the whole thing, do the element shows as I described, then unhide the container
[11:43:41] <doug65536> ok perfect
[11:44:26] <doug65536> 500k reflows would be awful in any browser :)
[11:44:37] <Lindrian> same error doug65536
[11:44:45] <guzzlefry> I see some jquery calls wrapped in (function($) { }) (jQuery); What's the purpose of this?
[11:45:06] <doug65536> guzzlefry: to make it work when the user of jquery used .noConflict and $ isn't defined
[11:45:27] <guzzlefry> Is that a common practice? I never see it mentioned in tutorials.
[11:45:32] <Lindrian> ill be back in a bit
[11:45:42] <doug65536> guzzlefry: it's a common practice for properly done jquery plugins, yes
[11:45:51] <guzzlefry> I see, thank you
[11:46:43] <doug65536> Lindrian: I wonder how that is possible!
[11:47:49] <doug65536> Lindrian: try $('.many_elements') in the console. does that throw an exception?
[11:48:11] <doug65536> Lindrian: what is the real selector?
[11:49:33] <BillCriswell> Lindrian: http://jsbin.com/EHoWIbe/1/edit would this approach work better?
[11:49:50] <doug65536> Lindrian: I just had a thought: if you have any unbalanced tags (missing closing tags) it might end up doing a horrible recurse
[11:49:57] <Guest80086> getting  ERROR bad URI `/[object%20Object]'
[11:50:01] <Guest80086> when posting in ajax
[11:50:10] <Guest80086> what's wrong?
[11:50:14] <Guest80086> is my URL wrong?
[11:50:26] <BillCriswell> Guest80086: You're trying to use an object as a string it looks like.
[11:51:18] <Guest80086> BillCriswell, https://gist.github.com/Edwardzyc/6584828
[11:51:28] <Guest80086> That doesn't look like an object.. :\
[11:51:41] <BillCriswell> Guest80086: Haha. No idea.
[11:52:27] <BillCriswell> Oh wait.
[11:52:32] <Scott0_> someone helped me with a simple counter script on Friday and I didn't save the jfiddle :(
[11:52:38] <doug65536> jsbin :|
[11:52:40] <BillCriswell> Duh, post needs $.post('/nearby');
[11:52:54] <BillCriswell> Guest80086: You might mean to use $.ajax({})
[11:53:31] <Scott0_> who is jfc?
[11:53:52] <Scott0_> or jtc
[11:54:00] <BillCriswell> The only thing tht comes to mind for "JFC" is blasphemous.
[11:54:04] <BillCriswell> Oh... no idea.
[11:54:09] <Scott0_> BillCriswell: lol
[11:54:15] <doug65536> Lindrian: works for me
[11:54:20] <Guest80086> BillCriswell, ok thanks
[11:54:28] <BillCriswell> Guest80086: Welcome.
[11:54:39] <Scott0_> would anyone be able to throw together a quick 5 line counter that indefinitely increments?
[11:55:23] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: var counter = 0; setInterval(function(){ counter++; console.log( counter }, 100);
[11:55:45] <BillCriswell> Er, console.log( counter )}
[11:55:54] <BillCriswell> Why 5 lines?
[11:55:56] <Scott0_> log based counter?
[11:56:02] <Scott0_> BillCriswell: just indicating it should be short
[11:56:05] <Scott0_> nothing complicated
[11:56:28] <Scott0_> I know the rate of icnrement and the base value
[11:56:33] <BillCriswell> var logs = [ 'oak', 'maple' ]; ?
[11:56:47] <doug65536> c
[11:56:47] <doug65536> o
[11:56:48] <doug65536> u
[11:56:48] <doug65536> n
[11:56:48] <doug65536> ter
[11:57:00] <BillCriswell> doug65536: That was graceful.
[11:57:05] <Scott0_> doug65536: I should have known someone would do that
[11:57:06] <BillCriswell> Like a chubby guy falling down some stairs.
[11:57:51] <grafi> best analogy evar
[11:58:03] <BillCriswell> logs.push('mahogany')
[11:58:11] <BillCriswell> I think that's all the wood I know.
[11:58:36] <Scott0_> cedar
[11:59:47] <Scott0_> BillCriswell:  the script used an html element to hodl the current value and update it and utilized a function to turn string to integer in the process
[12:00:07] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: Tjere
[12:00:14] <BillCriswell> There's parseInt() or +'1' ?
[12:00:26] <Scott0_> ah parseInt
[12:00:39] <Scott0_> how do you read from the html element?
[12:01:09] <_rgn> i would never read from html in this case
[12:02:12] <BillCriswell> so you could do like... var $counter = $('.counter'); value = +$.trim($counter.text()); setInterval(function(){ $counter.text( value++ ); }, 500);
[12:02:31] <Scott0_> I need to display the value, should it just update the value displayed rather than hold it there?
[12:02:57] <doug65536> BillCriswell: +1 for not doing dom lookup every update
[12:03:13] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: http://jsbin.com/etAGiG/1/edit
[12:03:25] <BillCriswell> Is what I'd do I guess.
[12:03:37] <Scott0_> why can't everyone just use one js sandbox site?
[12:03:38] <Scott0_> lol
[12:03:45] <Scott0_> which is better jsbin or jsfiddle?
[12:03:53] <Scott0_> is there a good reason to use one vs the toer?
[12:03:58] <Scott0_> *other
[12:03:59] <BillCriswell> different strokes for different folks, and so on and so on
[12:04:00] <NoiseEee> you hate freedom or something Scott0_?
[12:04:04] <BillCriswell> and scooby doobie doo
[12:04:15] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: Sounding awful unamerican.
[12:04:20] <Scott0_> lol
[12:04:22] <doug65536> http://www.sqlfiddle.com/
[12:04:34] <Scott0_> usually if there are 2 then one has somethiong the other doesn't
[12:05:32] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: I like that jsbin updates automatically most of the time.
[12:05:39] <BillCriswell> Sometimes it just makes me want to punch shit.
[12:05:46] <BillCriswell> I also like the layout of jsbin more.
[12:06:00] <BillCriswell> Luckily there's a checkbox for it.
[12:06:21] <BillCriswell> I like the columns vs the grid
[12:06:29] <Scott0_> whatd id you do with the variables?
[12:06:31] <Scott0_> why the comma?
[12:06:37] <BillCriswell> comma who?
[12:07:03] <doug65536> Scott0_: he's sharing the var if that's what you're talking about
[12:07:17] <BillCriswell> Ohhhhhh.
[12:07:18] <doug65536> Scott0_: instead of separate var per variable
[12:08:54] <Scott0_> oh weird
[12:08:57] <grafi> [21:05:34] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: I like that jsbin updates automatically most of the time. << that confuses me every time i use it ...
[12:09:12] <BillCriswell> grafi: Haha, there's a checkbos to turn it off.
[12:09:14] <Scott0_> what do you mean it updates automatically?
[12:09:15] <BillCriswell> checkbox*
[12:09:25] <Scott0_> when you change the code?
[12:09:30] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: As you type... it updates the output automatically.
[12:09:38] <Scott0_> neat
[12:09:39] <doug65536> for fun I'm making a jsfiddle clone that updates automatically
[12:09:53] <grafi> git clone jsbin ^^
[12:09:55] <Scott0_> BillCriswell: im guessing the interval of 500is in ms?
[12:10:13] <doug65536> grafi: what fun is that?
[12:10:17] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: You bet.
[12:10:25] <grafi> getting stuff doned
[12:10:27] <grafi> :P
[12:10:48] <grafi> also is your clone on github? ^^
[12:10:51] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: The second parameter is the delay in milliseconds.
[12:10:57] <doug65536> every time I use jsfiddle a voice in my head says "I can do this better"...
[12:11:10] <grafi> you're going crazy ^^
[12:11:24] <BillCriswell> 1000 milliseconds = 1 second
[12:11:32] <doug65536> it really annoys me that you can't search your fiddles
[12:11:37] <BillCriswell> "milli" and "million" always confuses me
[12:11:42] <grafi> search?
[12:11:43] <grafi> like how
[12:11:53] <grafi> inside a fiddle or all your fiddles?
[12:11:59] <doug65536> all your fiddles
[12:12:11] <grafi> i guess i dont have that many yet
[12:12:49] <doug65536> also, if you accidentally run a fiddle with an infinite loop, browser hangs and crashes (or you have to wait REALLY long for it to offer to kill it) so you might lose work
[12:14:35] <Scott0_> BillCriswell: http://jsbin.com/etAGiG/2/ apparently mi not doing something right, I was going for holding the value in a variable and updating the display
[12:15:46] <doug65536> Scott0_: that link is a good example of why jsfiddle is better
[12:15:46] <BillCriswell> Scott0_: Not just +, you'd need +=
[12:15:51] <BillCriswell> http://jsbin.com/etAGiG/4/edit
[12:16:10] <Scott0_> ah there we go
[12:16:16] <doug65536> jsfiddle has it the other way - you add /show to do what your link did
[12:23:15] <Scott0_> BillCriswell: thanks
[12:23:23] <BillCriswell> You're welcome.
[12:23:34] <Scott0_> I was gonna use a fancy flip counter

[12:41:06] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/gAFkL/3/ <--- right now this is setup so that when you put in text for your first competition, the text will be display on the next label. However, in my case the value gets AJAX'd in to the competition text box and the label doesn't get the text
[12:41:22] <bigLanky> how cna i modify my code to take whatever data is in there and not due it when someone manually types
[12:42:18] <doug65536> bigLanky: fire a change event on the input box with $('#competitor').trigger('change'), that's a simple way anyway
[12:42:46] <Velveeta> ajax'd into the competition text box?
[12:42:51] <bigLanky> yes
[12:42:56] <bigLanky> so i get that value from ajax
[12:43:12] <cek> jquery.pageless plugin is a big pile of crap
[12:43:34] <bigLanky> doug65536: $('#competitor').trigger('change', function(event) {
[12:43:37] <Velveeta> so your problem is that when the ajax request sets the content of that box, it's not also setting the label for the next line?
[12:43:37] <bigLanky> is that the right syntax ?
[12:43:43] <bigLanky> correct
[12:43:52] <bigLanky> however if i remove the ajax text and type my own text, then it works
[12:43:58] <bigLanky> but when ajax inserts the value it doesnt see it
[12:44:16] <doug65536> bigLanky: no... you set it, then to invoke the existing handler, you can use .trigger('change'). either that or refactor that code into a function that you call from both places
[12:44:29] <Velveeta> yeah, there's a change blur keyup event bound to it, which isn't triggered by programmatic changes
[12:44:41] <Velveeta> you should be able to just trigger blur on that field after your ajax request fills the value though
[12:44:50] <Velveeta> $('#competitotr').trigger('blur');
[12:45:23] <bigLanky> doug65536: im not sure what you mean
[12:45:53] <bigLanky> i need to do $('#competitor').trigger('change') first?
[12:45:56] <doug65536> bigLanky: changing it with .text won't cause a change event, so that code that sets the label won't run, which you know already. you can FORCE that event to happen with .trigger
[12:46:18] <bigLanky> http://jsfiddle.net/gAFkL/6/
[12:46:21] <doug65536> after
[12:46:44] <Velveeta> no, you had your listener set up properly before
[12:46:56] <Velveeta> but you have to manually invoke that listener in your ajax request
[12:47:24] <Velveeta> so within your success function, where you're setting that value from the server, *after* it's set, trigger change on that field
[12:47:36] <bigLanky> how would i call that?
[12:47:38] <Velveeta> that will invoke that event listener
[12:47:43] <bigLanky> call .trigger('change')
[12:48:04] <Velveeta> $('#competitor').trigger('change');
[12:48:11] <Velveeta> inside your ajax success function
[12:48:20] <Velveeta> *after* you've set the value of that field
[12:48:23] <bigLanky> and that line goes on my ajax call not the jquery for this section
[12:48:24] <bigLanky> ok
[12:48:30] <Velveeta> right
[12:48:30] <doug65536> bigLanky: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/gAFkL/8/

[13:04:17] <Ericx2x> yea i dont think that other one i linked does videwo
[13:04:43] <Scott0_> I need to have this counter loaded on mulitple sites, is there anything wrong with creating a js file and having it load for those sites, and if a page as the correct element id, then it will start counting?
[13:04:50] <Scott0_> is this the wrong approach?
[13:07:33] <ph88> Scott0_: #javascript
[13:07:52] <Scott0_> because its so busy in here?
[13:08:08] <NoiseEee> Scott0_: i mean, aside from the script being included for no reason on those sites (extra http call)...
[13:08:11] <Scott0_> and off-topic
[13:08:19] <ph88> Scott0_: excuse me i thought i was talking on another channel -___-
[13:08:44] <Scott0_> NoiseEee: yeah that will happen, but its so small
[13:09:46] <Scott0_> NoiseEee: the values it works from will be generated daily, so I wasn't sure to either create a json file, or create a js file that's shared from another domain
[13:10:15] <NoiseEee> Scott0_: the json file will give you problems if you're trying to access it from other domains, whereas the <script src='http://anywhere.com/'> won't
[13:10:19] <Scott0_> I guess I could check for the existence of the element, then load the json
[13:10:41] <Scott0_> json can't be loaded from another domain?
[13:10:50] <NoiseEee> you can't make an xhr call to another domain, no
[13:11:08] <Scott0_> ok
[13:11:45] <Scott0_> xml can can't it?
[13:11:51] <Scott0_> like rss
[13:12:46] <Scott0_> I have to have the counter display on a wordpress site (stabs eyes)
[13:13:06] <Scott0_> so im trying to stick with js
[13:14:39] <Scott0_> I hope my only option isn't to use php to grab the data
[13:17:37] <doug65536> Scott0_: the server has to send a header that tells the browser that a cross-site request is allowed, otherwise, the browser will abort the request
[13:18:00] <doug65536> Scott0_: you could also resort to jsonp
[13:18:07] <Scott0_> jsonp?
[13:18:22] <doug65536> is the data json?
[13:18:31] <Scott0_> its just 2 values I need to share
[13:18:45] <Scott0_> figured websites use data from other domanis pretty frequently
[13:18:57] <Scott0_> and they frequently load js files from toher domains also
[13:19:11] <doug65536> yes, you can load js files cross-domain
[13:19:36] <doug65536> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing
[13:19:41] <Scott0_> its gonna beanother request whether its for the js file or a json
[13:19:49] <Scott0_> so I may as well just use the js file method
[13:23:04] <Scott0_> doug65536: if I load a js file, it won't run onload will it?
[13:23:20] <doug65536> Scott0_: it will run yes... why?
[13:23:47] <Scott0_> for some reason I thought id have to tell it to in some inline code
[13:27:10] <doug65536> Scott0_: you add a script tag to head to dynamically load a js file
[13:27:24] <Scott0_> yeah
[13:27:30] <doug65536> Scott0_: it runs immediately when it has finished loading
[13:27:46] <Scott0_> so then the counter should begin counting
[13:28:05] <doug65536> Scott0_: yes
[13:28:12] <Scott0_> ill give that a try, otherwise mi looking at using a php proxy for cross-domain requests
[13:28:18] <Scott0_> :/
[13:28:22] <doug65536> there's a free proxy
[13:28:31] <Scott0_> http://benalman.com/code/projects/php-simple-proxy/examples/simple/
[13:28:34] <doug65536> assuming it isn't security sensitive it should work ok
[13:28:43] <doug65536> Scott0_: http://corsproxy.com/
[13:28:45] <Scott0_> no, not security sensitive
[13:28:55] <Scott0_> just 2 values which can do no harm
[13:29:33] <Scott0_> id rather use one I can place on the server
[13:29:44] <doug65536> ok, do that, it's better
[13:32:27] <nicetry> Hey there.  I'm using jQuery to find a number of areas an click on them.  I want to do a callback after the last click event. However when I put the callback in the .click() it does the callback after every click, not the very last click. How can I achieve the behavior I desire?
[13:35:11] <doug65536> nicetry: you could use setTimeout with an extremely short delay - that should cause your code to run after all the click handlers
[13:35:53] <nicetry> true, but I'm more wondering if this is a thing that jquery can do/know
[13:36:01] <nicetry> does it know when its on its last click?
[13:36:24] <nicetry> or when its done going through all the elements I've selected
[13:36:24] <doug65536> nicetry: that was exposed before but now it is internal
[13:36:34] <nicetry> srsly?
[13:36:44] <doug65536> the event data, yeah
[13:37:02] <doug65536> why does it matter? if order matters, you are probably doing something wrong
[13:37:40] <doug65536> you are asking an XY question
[13:37:53] <doug65536> you want to do X, but asking Y
[13:38:21] <doug65536> !xy
[13:38:36] <doug65536> hmm, wrong channel I guess :)
[13:38:41] <nicetry> haha
[13:38:45] <nicetry> yeah I may be doing things wrong
[13:39:01] <doug65536> what are you really doing? I might have a suggestion
[13:39:02] <nicetry> And I do want a little bit of order in here, but not too much, I swear!
[13:40:05] <doug65536> your question is unclear. you want to cause your handler to be called last, where there are several handlers on the same element?
[13:40:45] <doug65536> what do you mean "the last click"
[13:40:55] <nicetry> Right now, when a list item is clicked, a number of things happen.  One of those things is the li expands and reveals more info (other things include ajax events, scrolls...etc...etc...).  Client has decided he wants a 'expand all li' button.
[13:41:21] <doug65536> nicetry: oh so you want to know when all the animation is done? you can do that
[13:41:21] <nicetry> So I was thinking I could create a state where only the expansion happens, and none of the other events
[13:41:44] <nicetry> then return to the default state once all of those things expand
[13:41:46] <nicetry> exactly
[13:42:17] <doug65536> ok, something like $('#whatever li').slideDown().promise().done(function() { ... all done here ... });
[13:42:51] <nicetry> ah promises
[13:42:53] <thrustcore> I suppose it's really easy to add one of those loading thingies that twirls around until things are ready, right?

[13:43:18] <BillCriswell> loading.gif
[13:43:20] <doug65536> thrustcore: I call them all hourglasses :D Guess i'm old
[13:43:21] <BillCriswell> I dunno.
[13:43:30] <BillCriswell> a ticktockie
[13:43:32] <nicetry> I actually just found out the name recently, but I can't bring it back
[13:43:40] <nicetry> there's a wiki about it
[13:43:42] <doug65536> wait cursor?
[13:43:56] <BillCriswell> busy?
[13:43:57] <nicetry> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Throbber
[13:44:01] <nicetry> Throbber
[13:44:04] <BillCriswell> That sounds really dirty.
[13:44:36] * nicetry is getting all hot and bothered while waiting for you to ajax your data
[13:45:03] <BillCriswell> This damn throbber is still just sitting here not doing anything.
[13:45:11] <nicetry> man, never thought I'd need that bit of trivia
[13:45:26] <BillCriswell> "waity jawn" sounds good
[13:45:30] <NoiseEee> BillCriswell: my wife says that all the time
[13:45:46] <BillCriswell> "wait jawn"
[13:45:52] <NoiseEee> earlier one.
[13:46:00] <nicetry> jawn?
[13:46:32] <doug65536> I've been programming for 27 years and this is the first time I've heard that ridiculous term "throbber"
[13:46:34] <nicetry> http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jawn
[13:46:44] <BillCriswell> jawn === thing
[13:46:49] <BillCriswell> in my professional opinion
[13:47:08] <BillCriswell> Damn, didn't know it was  a philly thing.
[13:47:12] <nicetry> ah urban diction definition #4
[13:48:06] <BillCriswell> I wonder if I'm a "Philly cat"
[13:48:15] <nicetry> This throbber jawn just wont' go away!
[13:48:25] <BillCriswell> nicetry: Expert usage.
[14:00:12] <andrew9183> is there a good hashchange plugin
[14:03:37] <nicetry>  andrew9183 hashchange?
[14:06:14] <Ericx2x> anyone have a jquery lightbox that doesn't need a commercial license?
[14:16:26] <ryanneufeld> Ericx2x: Google it man, There are literally 100's
[14:18:20] <BillCriswell> Ugh, giving 2 weeks always sucks.
[14:21:22] <grafi> doug65536 thats means you are at least 27years old?
[14:21:24] <grafi> crazy
[14:21:24] <grafi> :P
[14:21:56] <Zzaichik> I like colorbox
[14:22:00] <grafi> BillCriswell, huh?
[14:22:06] <Ericx2x> Zzaichik i'm using it
[14:22:13] <Ericx2x> but i have a jquery confliction issue now
[14:22:28] <Ericx2x> i had it before and doug65536 helped me but i need to recall it
[14:23:39] <BillCriswell> grafi: Quitting.
[14:23:42] <doug65536> Ericx2x: yes
[14:35:26] <Ericx2x> doug65536 thanks for teaching me last time
[14:35:32] <Ericx2x> its actually rather simple for me now
[14:36:49] <Ericx2x> doug65536 you're a really helpful person
[14:37:06] <Ericx2x> i see you on here often helping and chatting
[14:37:35] <doug65536> I try to help when I can
[14:40:03] <grafi> BillCriswell have a new job ready?
[14:40:11] <BillCriswell> grafi: Yes.
[14:40:28] <grafi> Good :) Otherwise I would have wished you luck :P
[14:40:46] <BillCriswell> Figures as soon as I do that I have like 3 places that I submitted my resume to get back to me... Unbelievable how timing works sometimes.
[14:40:57] <grafi> :D
[14:41:02] <grafi> Thats cool
[14:42:09] <BillCriswell> Yeah, blah.
[14:42:34] <grafi> Haha
[14:44:45] <eddief1029> is there any way to get the behavior of slide but the accuracy of stop for jQuery UI slider: http://jsfiddle.net/edRue/ i want the number to update live, but slide seems to be inaccurate, specially if you move your mouse fast to one end of the slider.....
[14:48:50] <BillCriswell> Wonder what "advanced CSS" is?
[14:49:15] <grafi> i am
[14:53:06] <eddief1029> nvm figured it out
[14:53:11] <BillCriswell> lol i don't know how I should answer this.
[14:56:39] <grafi> boop
[14:56:48] <grafi> i am too lazy
[15:00:49] <Ericx2x> BillCriswell did you do something that allowed you to find jobs easier?
[15:01:26] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: Networking seems 1.345 million more effective than anything.
[15:01:50] <Ericx2x> networking as in saying "f off" to recruiters?
[15:02:07] <razzi> Ericx2x what worked for me to be the best at each job.
[15:02:27] <razzi> customers notice you, they talk about you, etc.
[15:02:52] <Ericx2x> what do you mean by customers?
[15:02:56] <BillCriswell> Ericx2x: I'm never rude to them haha.
[15:02:57] <grafi> so you are the best?
[15:03:10] <grafi> nice to meet you razzi
[15:03:12] <grafi> :P
[15:03:21] <razzi> grafi re-read i guess
[15:03:49] <grafi> [00:02:09] <razzi> Ericx2x what worked for me to be the best at each job.
[15:03:56] <grafi> hm?
[15:04:08] <grafi> just kidding anyways
[15:04:16] <BillCriswell> Have a good one guys.
[15:04:29] <Ericx2x> just curious but what server side language do you guys prefer?
[15:04:54] <Ericx2x> i've been using php but im wondering if i were to try something like python or ruby it may be easier to find work?
[15:05:32] <grafi> i dont know about easier
[15:05:48] <grafi> but it certainly helps to broaden your knowledge
[15:05:51] <grafi> in general
[15:06:15] <duckgoose> Ericx2x php is highly easy as is, and very common :P
[15:06:27] <duckgoose> I think you would have the most with php actually
[15:06:35] <duch_kazatel> Ericx2x php is pretty common, but understandng basic programming concepts is really the important part.
[15:06:43] <duckgoose> most luck*
[15:06:51] <grafi> duckgoose really?
[15:07:09] <duckgoose> the best thing to do is the learn all of a category
[15:07:11] <grafi> isnt the new thing for hip start ups not to use php? ^^
[15:07:27] <duch_kazatel> grafi you don't want to work for most hip new startups ;)
[15:07:31] <grafi> idk, I think python programmers are wanted
[15:07:32] <duckgoose> e.g. if you're going to do web development you really should learn the tricks of both php and ruby
[15:07:40] <duckgoose> and sql and asp and all that jazz
[15:07:48] <grafi> yeah true
[15:08:03] <grafi> obv
[15:08:09] <duch_kazatel> .NET is pretty neat imo, if really windows-centric.
[15:08:24] <Ericx2x> oh right
[15:08:29] <Ericx2x> lots of job listings i see for .net
[15:08:37] <Ericx2x> although from what i've been told .net is a nightmare
[15:08:53] <Ericx2x> takes a day to get setup compared to a few hours w/ something else
[15:08:56] <grafi> everything is a nightmare :p
[15:09:03] <duch_kazatel> i've worked in python, coldfusion, php, etc.
[15:09:05] <grafi> php definitely is
[15:09:06] <grafi> ^^
[15:09:13] <duch_kazatel> .NET was the most integrated setup I've seen so far.
[15:09:18] <duch_kazatel> everything is tightly integrated.
[15:09:29] <duch_kazatel> visual studio is actually pretty kickass.
[15:09:38] <Ericx2x> how do i go about learning .net
[15:09:41] <Ericx2x> does it cost money?
[15:09:48] <Ericx2x> and i hate visual studio
[15:09:49] <duch_kazatel> use a language that sits on top of .NET.
[15:10:08] <JosephSilber> grafi: Have you dealt with modern PHP frameworks?
[15:10:35] <grafi> are you trying to convince me that php is not a nightmare JosephSilber ?
[15:10:36] <grafi> :P
[15:10:44] <duch_kazatel> learn C# - it can use the .NET framework and integrates really well.
[15:10:54] <JosephSilber> grafi: It's got its ugly side, but I wouldn't call it a nightmare
[15:11:03] <JosephSilber> At least PHP 5.3+
[15:11:10] <duch_kazatel> there are also a ton of other languages that you can use on .NET - ironpython, ironruby...
[15:11:13] <duch_kazatel> there are other.s
[15:11:41] <grafi> Well I'm exaggerting obv, just trying to say you will find weaknesses everywhere
[15:11:53] <grafi> otherwise there would only be one right language ^^
[15:12:25] <grafi> I like php, I use php, but I am fully aware thats its somewhat crazy
[15:13:15] <Ericx2x> besides php what is the most common?
[15:13:31] <duch_kazatel> for server-side languages?
[15:13:45] <JosephSilber> grafi: If you're looking for a nightmare in PHP, I'd say go look at the PHP internals mailing list.
[15:13:46] <JosephSilber> http://philsturgeon.co.uk/blog/2013/09/t-paamayim-nekudotayim-v-sanity
[15:13:58] <grafi> i've read that ^^
[15:14:02] <grafi> #drama
[15:14:03] <grafi> <:
[15:14:11] <duch_kazatel> http://w3techs.com/technologies/market/programming_language <- not sure about the accuracy.
[15:16:12] <duckgoose> I'd like to see jQuery for desktop programming
[15:16:18] <shoky> heh that paamayim nekudotayim thing always cracks me up
[15:16:23] <duckgoose> I do that not with chrome, but it's highly limited
[15:16:33] <duckgoose> -not+now
[15:16:46] <duch_kazatel> jQuery for desktops...? you mean like the utility functions and whatnot?
[15:17:16] <duckgoose> like file-system access, threading
[15:17:49] <duch_kazatel> Node.js
[15:17:52] <duch_kazatel> javascript on the client/.
[15:18:04] <duch_kazatel> rather, on the desktop.
[15:18:11] <JosephSilber> duckgoose: Windows 8 apps
[15:18:17] <duckgoose> bah
[15:18:24] <duch_kazatel> oh yeah, windows 8 does that, too.
[15:18:47] <JosephSilber> http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/javascript-ajax/building-windows-store-applications-with-jquery-2-0/
[15:18:51] <duckgoose> windows 8 apps aren't to my liking :/
[15:18:53] <duckgoose> I mean
[15:19:05] <JosephSilber> duckgoose: join the club.
[15:19:07] <duckgoose> you can't run them without them being in the store
[15:19:08] <JosephSilber> Nobody does.
[15:19:19] <JosephSilber> Whoever does, doesn't count :)
[15:19:29] <duckgoose> unless you're debugging...
[15:19:44] <duckgoose> this Node.js says it uses chromes JS engine
[15:19:50] <JosephSilber> v8
[15:19:54] <duckgoose> I already use chrome for desktop apps, but it's limited :P
[15:20:00] <JosephSilber> Node.js
[15:20:05] <JosephSilber> has its own API
[15:20:13] <duch_kazatel> node.js runs javascript on V8 - has nothing to do with chrome.
[15:20:22] <JosephSilber> Totally different than Chrome Packaged Apps.
[15:20:25] <duckgoose> o.o
[15:20:30] <JosephSilber> All it uses is the engine, not the API
[15:20:33] <duckgoose> it says at nodejs.org "Node.js is a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime"
[15:20:45] <JosephSilber> runtime = engine. Not API
[15:20:51] <duch_kazatel> bingo.
[15:20:53] <fgh> lmao @ paamayim nekudotayim
[15:21:24] <duch_kazatel> you can create full webapps using it.
[15:21:29] <duch_kazatel> it's cool stuff.
[15:21:37] <JosephSilber> fgh: The biggest joke is that "paamayim nekudotayim" isn't even correct Hebrew!
[15:21:51] <duckgoose> does this build executibles
[15:22:05] <duch_kazatel> nope.
[15:22:10] <shoky> JosephSilber: why not?
[15:22:16] <duckgoose> so
[15:22:29] <shoky> it's correct hebrew
[15:22:38] <duckgoose> a person needs to install Node.js to run the apps?
[15:22:44] <shoky> "twice colon"
[15:22:46] <duch_kazatel> yes
[15:22:48] <duch_kazatel> it's a host.
[15:22:48] <duckgoose> they're packaged though right
[15:23:01] <duch_kazatel> "packaged" as in...?
[15:23:30] <duckgoose> as in a single file that has all the resources the app uses
[15:23:33] <duckgoose> like java
[15:23:42] <JosephSilber> shoky: Twice colon is not correct. It's double colon. Should nekudatayim kfulim
[15:23:47] <JosephSilber> should be*
[15:24:19] <duch_kazatel> err, you can download ZIP files that contain the entire directory structure.
[15:24:35] <duckgoose> D;
[15:24:35] <shoky> JosephSilber: it's not the proper formal term, true. it's still valid hebrew, as in a phrase people would use
[15:24:44] <duckgoose> you have to unzip them to use them right
[15:24:59] <duch_kazatel> there's also npm, which is node's package manager, that you can use to download utility functions that are publicly availabloe./
[15:25:02] <duch_kazatel> *available
[15:25:12] <duch_kazatel> and sure, though .JAR files are also just archives.
[15:25:29] <JosephSilber> shoky: http://www.reddit.com/r/PHP/comments/1m26z1/t_paamayim_nekudotayim_v_sanity/cc549dp
[15:25:37] <duckgoose> if it's not easy to get a node.js build app running then thats no fun ;<
[15:25:47] <duch_kazatel> err, it is easy....
[15:25:51] <duckgoose> it needs to be usable even for pc newbs
[15:25:55] <duch_kazatel> it is...
[15:26:01] <duckgoose> okay
[15:26:06] <duckgoose> well I'll look into this
[15:26:06] <fgh> JosephSilber, I didn't know that :o
[15:26:09] <shoky> JosephSilber: right, it's correct hebrew for "twice colon". the fact that "twice colon" is not the right term, is something else
[15:26:20] <duch_kazatel> err, what's your end goal, duckgoose
[15:26:32] <fgh> but that's probably what non-english speaking programmers should avoid doing
[15:26:33] <duckgoose> dropping .net
[15:26:42] <duckgoose> using JavaScript for all my programming
[15:26:53] <duch_kazatel> why in the world would you drop .NET?
[15:27:01] <JosephSilber> shoky: Are you a native Hebrew speaker?
[15:27:08] <duckgoose> cross compatibility reasons
[15:27:10] <shoky> JosephSilber: yes
[15:27:12] <dtg_> we should drop .COM too
[15:27:24] <duch_kazatel> duckgoose aaaaah you want to write cross-platform apps?
[15:27:27] <fgh> and .ORG too
[15:27:28] <duckgoose> mono is not a .net replacement either
[15:27:44] <JosephSilber> shoky: And are you saying that non-php people regularly use nekudatayim paamayim to say double colon?
[15:27:45] <duch_kazatel> that's not what i was going to suggest...
[15:28:05] <dtg_> duckgoose: i go c++ mostly for those reasons
[15:28:11] <duch_kazatel> if you want to write cross-platform, use python imo
[15:28:16] <dtg_> and write only in C if i need my program to be sane
[15:28:19] <fgh> how about java?
[15:28:29] <dtg_> i dont write much in java
[15:28:32] <duckgoose> bah
[15:28:47] <fgh> jvm is pretty 'cross'
[15:28:51] <dtg_> there are issues which i wont mention here due to its sensitivity
[15:28:57] <duckgoose> I could make a program in assembly is I wanted to take the time
[15:29:04] <shoky> JosephSilber: as regularly as they use "twice colon" or "colon twice"
[15:29:10] <dtg_> assembly is hardly portable
[15:29:10] <duckgoose> I like quick and easy and I don't think c++ covers that
[15:29:12] <duch_kazatel> java is much better than it used to be.
[15:29:21] <dtg_> c++ is better than it used to be
[15:29:25] <dtg_> its still horrible though
[15:29:26] <duch_kazatel> python is pretty kickass as long as speed isn't you're #1 priority.
[15:29:29] <dtg_> worst language in the world
[15:29:31] <duch_kazatel> *your
[15:29:38] <duckgoose> python has no gui D:
[15:29:44] <duch_kazatel> wat
[15:30:00] <duch_kazatel> there are tons of gui frameworks out there for it.
[15:30:02] <dtg_> http://www.wxpython.org/
[15:30:07] <dtg_> what are you babbling about, goose
[15:30:09] <boytoy_> Hello, at http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/54/edit (trying to set proper video widths for mobile and desktop) -- why won't $current_maxwidth seem to work properly inside embedly()?
[15:30:14] <duckgoose> those are third party guis
[15:30:14] <duch_kazatel> tkinter
[15:30:44] <shoky> JosephSilber: anyway i do agree that it's not the proper term, i didn't mean to imply that it's not a joke, any way you look at it :P
[15:30:49] <boytoy_> * why am I not able to call $current_maxwidth from inside embedly()?
[15:30:50] <dtg_> well, the first party guis are horrible
[15:30:55] <dtg_> like the one you are about to drop
[15:31:01] <duckgoose> I don't like the idea of having a person install python then some gui framework then my app
[15:31:10] <duckgoose> thats too annoying of a process
[15:31:23] <duch_kazatel> err, you can compile python to an EXE...
[15:31:32] <JosephSilber> shoky: az en li od ma lehgid :P
[15:31:34] <duch_kazatel> and have the whole app be self-contained.
[15:31:42] <shoky> ;P
[15:31:49] <duckgoose> for windows...
[15:31:53] <duckgoose> then I'd just use .net :P
[15:32:03] <JosephSilber> shoky: ani lo roeh shum to'elet baze
[15:32:13] <dtg_> congratulations, pass GO and collect $200
[15:32:15] <shoky> JosephSilber: be ma?
[15:32:28] <duch_kazatel> duckgoose name one language that can fulfill your requirements, then...
[15:32:34] <duch_kazatel> there's going to be some give and take.
[15:32:43] <dtg_> i don't think he is worried about the language
[15:32:53] <dtg_> he just wants the frameworks to be cross platform
[15:33:02] <JosephSilber> shoky: nekudatayim paamayim. Ledaati, hem pashut tzrichim letargem et ze leanglit, veshalom
[15:33:25] <duch_kazatel> but to him making the end user install a bunch of dependencies is unreasonable.
[15:33:34] <dtg_> and cross platformness will ALWAYS be third party, because first party UIs by definition are made for the platform
[15:33:34] <duckgoose> JavaScript would, with html interface, and system apis
[15:33:42] <shoky> JosephSilber: oh, of course it should be in english ;p but then we'd have less to laugh about
[15:33:43] <duckgoose> Node.js might do the trick
[15:33:44] <dtg_> javascript is so third party
[15:34:00] <dtg_> and you will find that your program will have more bugs when you write in javascript
[15:34:05] <JosephSilber> shoky: Did you read Phil's latest post?
[15:34:21] <duch_kazatel> duckgoose what sort of apps are you looking to make?
[15:34:25] <dtg_> my company has attempted to transition to node.js from .NET before
[15:34:53] <dtg_> there have been issues with memory usage for example.
[15:34:56] <shoky> JosephSilber: just the beginning, i've heard of this before though
[15:34:59] <duckgoose> the only nice IDE based programming I could find for linux was Java, not having looked very hard...
[15:35:07] <dtg_> and many new bugs spring up due to programmers not knowing type coercion properly
[15:35:21] <dtg_> and return statements on a different line from what its supposed to return
[15:35:30] <duckgoose> anyway
[15:35:33] <dtg_> its a bad idea duckgoose
[15:35:35] <shoky> JosephSilber: i don't do php, fortunately
[15:35:38] <dtg_> dont go to javascript if you are leaving .net
[15:35:48] <JosephSilber> shoky: What do you do?
[15:35:52] <dtg_> i assure you you will have many regrets
[15:36:00] <duckgoose> c++ is overkill for what I'd like to make :P
[15:36:09] <duckgoose> I'm not trying to write something on that level
[15:36:13] <dtg_> then .net is fine for you
[15:36:27] <duckgoose> but lacks cross compatibility
[15:36:27] <dtg_> there must be something .net does not provide
[15:36:30] <shoky> JosephSilber: mmm a mix of c++/java/javascript and some other ventures
[15:36:34] <dtg_> how?
[15:36:37] <dtg_> mono works
[15:36:49] <duch_kazatel> dtg_ he doesn't want there to be 3rd party dependencies.
[15:36:53] <duckgoose> mono doesn't work well
[15:36:53] <dtg_> if you need to do something that is higher write that specific section in c++
[15:36:56] <shoky> JosephSilber: currently i'm very much into clojure
[15:37:04] <dtg_> or c
[15:37:04] <JosephSilber> shoky: And you find JavaScript more consistent than PHP? Interesting, to say the least.
[15:37:10] <dtg_> what do you mean mono doesnt work well?
[15:37:12] <dtg_> elaborate
[15:37:44] <duckgoose> it mainly works with c#, doesn't render winforms very well...
[15:37:46] <shoky> JosephSilber: i wouldn't really know about PHP so can't compare them myself. i've just read such articles and seen such examples
[15:38:10] <dtg_> ok, then clearly it is not mono you think is bad
[15:38:11] <duckgoose> it often won't run apps that my .net installs runs
[15:38:20] <dtg_> but rather the implementation of windows.forms on mono
[15:38:38] <duckgoose> most things have to actually be compiled in mono to work with mono
[15:38:47] <dtg_> thats not true
[15:38:49] <duckgoose> which is sad because monos ide isn't even close to .NET
[15:39:00] <dtg_> you do not need to write with monodevelop
[15:39:03] <duckgoose> yea it has!
[15:39:08] <dtg_> you can compile it on windows and run on linux
[15:39:13] <duckgoose> I have compiled apps here now that don't work on mono
[15:39:27] <dtg_> then you should find out what part of it doesnt work
[15:39:34] <duch_kazatel> you sure the .net version matches?
[15:39:34] <duckgoose> but work with the native .net runtime...
[15:39:58] <dtg_> its usually something silly like
[15:40:03] <dtg_> a DllImport to user32.dll
[15:40:05] <dtg_> or something
[15:40:08] <dtg_> that doesnt exist on mono
[15:40:19] <dtg_> i believe your problems may be trivial
[15:40:25] <dtg_> because 6 years have told me that
[15:40:39] <dtg_> you should find out what it is and fix it, instead of trashing the entire thing completely
[15:40:51] <duch_kazatel> dtg_++
[15:40:52] <dtg_> on the other hand, if you have serious server issues with memory and speed with .NET
[15:41:00] <dtg_> like i had
[15:41:09] <dtg_> then you should write the critical sections in C
[15:41:12] <dtg_> and interop
[15:41:38] <dtg_> and if that is not enough, THEN you can consider lowering to C++
[15:42:19] <dtg_> but i am speaking purely from maintaining a production system anyway
[15:42:19] <duckgoose> the problem I have is mono does not interpret .NET like the native .NET interpreter does
[15:42:31] <duckgoose> which means it is NOT a replacement for the .NET interpreter
[15:42:32] <dtg_> if you are doing your own hobby project, rewriting is a great thing to do
[15:42:42] <duch_kazatel> duckgoose huh?
[15:42:52] <dtg_> duckgoose: specifically what?
[15:42:57] <dtg_> what part is different
[15:42:58] <dtg_> ?
[15:43:02] <duch_kazatel> that shouldn't matter to you anyway...
[15:43:13] <dtg_> i know some bugs, but not too problematic
[15:43:25] <duckgoose> code that compiles in .NET's ide does not compile with mono
[15:43:30] <dtg_> like, there is a bug if you have generics inside another generic class
[15:43:36] <duckgoose> I don't recall the specific code, but I recall it didn't compile
[15:43:41] <dtg_> but that is easily solvable by flattening the heirarchy
[15:43:50] <dtg_> you should recall it then
[15:43:53] <duch_kazatel> it's all based around the ECMA standards for CLR and C#, right?
[15:43:58] <duch_kazatel> mono, I mean?
[15:43:59] <dtg_> because the details are important
[15:44:00] <duckgoose> exactly my point though
[15:44:04] <duckgoose> you have to program /for/ mono
[15:44:12] <dtg_> maybe just fixing that thing will solve your problem completely
[15:44:24] <duch_kazatel> so you want write once, run everywhere?  because that doesn't truly exist.
[15:44:27] <dtg_> yes yes, but you still havent been able to give us an example
[15:44:34] <dtg_> maybe we know the solution
[15:44:40] <dtg_> and your code will compile after this
[15:44:42] <duckgoose> my point is tossing mono on linux will not let you run .NET programs that aren't intended to run with linux
[15:44:43] <duch_kazatel> there a bugs I've found in Python for JUST windows, or in Node.js for JUST windows 64.
[15:45:06] <duch_kazatel> *there are
[15:45:31] <dtg_> well, we can only suggest you find out why it doesnt compile and make your decision from that
[15:45:46] <dtg_> it is your freedom to choose whatever framework you wish to work with, duckgoose
[15:45:56] <duckgoose> if I program for windows I'll be using .net, but I just thought html would make a nice UI for desktop applications
[15:45:58] <boytoy_> At http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/62/edit -- is there a way to make the JS properly center the play button no matter what size it is? Right now it's 150px and way off. Looks good at 77px though.
[15:45:58] <Japella> At http://jsbin.com/eqiyoc/62/edit  is there a way to make the JS properly center the play button no matter what size it is? Right now it's 150px and way off. Looks good at 77px though. now has -1 karma
[15:46:52] <boytoy_> Wow what are the chances of that! Both of us saying the exact same thing at the exact same time :p
[15:47:48] <duckgoose> I mean making a UI in html would pretty much look and act the same wherever, unless whatever is rendering the html is doing it poorly ,
[15:48:27] <duch_kazatel> duckgoose then bundle a rendering engine into your app and write against that.
[15:49:22] <duch_kazatel> or write everything as a webapp.
[15:49:30] <duckgoose> I could
[15:49:38] <duckgoose> if I had system apis
[15:49:55] <duch_kazatel> err, what kind of application is this?
[15:50:24] <DaniG2k> guys i have this jquery and I'd like to add a fadeIn effect
[15:50:25] <DaniG2k> https://gist.github.com/DaniG2k/6587672
[15:50:34] <DaniG2k> but apparently i need to hide it and then fadein?
[15:50:45] <duckgoose> well
[15:50:47] <boytoy_> DaniG2k: i think so yeah
[15:50:54] <duckgoose> say e.g. I wanted to delete a file on the system
[15:51:10] <DaniG2k> boytoy_: where do I put the hide? and where the fadein?
[15:51:18] <Zackko> How do I trigger a "change" event handler on an input that was bound using $('.some_container').on('input.the_input', â€¦); ?
[15:51:46] <duch_kazatel> duckgoose python then.
[15:52:05] <doug65536> Zackko: $('.some_container').trigger('input.the_input')
[15:52:10] <duckgoose> python would be great with html UI!
[15:52:16] <boytoy_> DaniG2k: it just makes sense it has to be unfaded before you can fade it
[15:52:33] <DaniG2k> boytoy_: right
[15:52:48] <duch_kazatel> duckgoose you still haven't explained what kind of applications you're looking to make.
[15:52:48] <Zackko> doug65536: That doesn't specify the event type?
[15:52:49] <doug65536> Zackko: ah, I see... $('whatever').trigger(eventnamehere)
[15:53:13] <boytoy_> DaniG2k: aint you suppose to hide it before the click function?
[15:53:27] <boytoy_> DaniG2k: or from the css?
[15:53:45] <DaniG2k> nah dont think so
[15:54:41] <boytoy_> well that sucks then
[15:55:45] <DaniG2k> boytoy_: ok i think i got it
[15:55:47] <DaniG2k> its ugly but
[15:55:49] <DaniG2k> works
[15:56:12] <DaniG2k> $(this).before($($($(this).data('fields').replace(regexp, time)).hide()).fadeIn())
[15:56:22] <DaniG2k> -_-
[15:56:32] <boytoy_> oh boy oh boy oh boy :P
[15:56:39] <DaniG2k> hahaha
[15:56:41] <DaniG2k> it works well though
[15:56:48] <DaniG2k> but its ugly
[15:57:33] <duckgoose> oh man
[15:58:33] <duckgoose> I've found what I was looking for
[15:59:26] <duckgoose> XULRunner is exactly what I was talking about!
[15:59:32] <DaniG2k> boytoy_: looks much better if broken up
[15:59:40] <DaniG2k> field = $($(this).data('fields').replace(regexp, time)).hide()
[15:59:46] <DaniG2k> $(this).before($(field).fadeIn())
[15:59:51] <DaniG2k> :D
[16:01:29] <boytoy_> yeah much better
[16:01:31] <boytoy_> lulz
[16:03:11] <msafi> Anyone know why this code doesn't remove all title attributes from div elements?
[16:03:12] <msafi> jQuery(document).ready(function ($) { $("div").removeAttr('title'); });
[16:03:46] <duch_kazatel> duckgoose errr, you're still talking about a third party cross-platform setup.
[16:03:58] <dtg_> lol
[16:04:01] <DHowett> msafi: could some have been added by events that fire later?
[16:04:26] <duckgoose> maybe I am
[16:04:33] <msafi> DHowett: http://jsfiddle.net/rTveD/
[16:05:45] <msafi> DHowett, you see how title attribute persists in the HTML output?
[16:08:35] <DHowett> msafi: (turned on jQuery in jsfiddle) - the title attr was removed, confirmed with the element inspector
[16:09:04] <doug65536> msafi: I see that jquery doesn't load
[16:09:17] <msafi> oh, sorry, I'm an idiot sometimes...
[16:09:21] <doug65536> msafi: http://jsfiddle.net/doug65536/rTveD/1/
[16:09:38] <doug65536> msafi: at the first hint of something wrong, always look at debugger console
[16:09:52] <msafi> doug65536, alright!
[16:10:49] <msafi> So, how can I get my selector to fire last on the page where I intend to use this user-script?
[16:11:15] <msafi> So that it removes the titles that get added by other scripts?
[16:11:42] <doug65536> msafi: setTimeout
[16:11:55] <msafi> Riiight! Thanks!
[16:15:37] <msafi> Yep, that worked. Thanks so much guys!
[16:16:23] <Ericx2x> hey guys i have copied the same webroot into two different hosting services. one of the hosting services works the other doesnt the javascript seems to work correctly on one hosting service but not on the other. Anyone have any guesses on what it could be causing this problem?
[16:19:16] <duch_kazatel> Ericx2x are you getting any errors?
[16:29:49] <abjorn> sup
[16:30:00] <abjorn> @ #jquery
[16:35:15] <boytoy_> sup man
[16:41:49] <Pritchard> Hi, guys.  How can I use replaceWith() and then chain operations on (or return) the new content?
[16:43:32] <guzzlefry> So, returning false on a click event should prevent a link from being followed, correct?
[16:44:03] <Pritchard> Found answer.  Thanks all.
[16:44:51] <mythgarr> Having trouble with the map function not removing values when I return null from the callback (http://jsfiddle.net/JKEs4/1/)
[16:44:56] <mythgarr> Or undefined
[16:45:08] <eddief1029> guzzlefry you might want to look into preventDefault();
[16:47:17] <guzzlefry> $("a[href*='constant-contact-pop-up']").click(function(evt) { evt.preventDefault(); }); <--- should should do, right? Trying to figure out why it doesn't work.
[16:47:29] <guzzlefry> err, s/should/that/
[16:47:51] <eddief1029> yeah looks right
[16:48:07] <guzzlefry> odd that it doesn't work. :/
[16:50:22] <eddief1029> hmm a made a quick fiddle and theres some stuff that it doesnt work with, for example a link tag with target="_blank"
[16:52:24] <eddief1029> ^ scratch that, not true
[16:53:47] <mythgarr> Anybody have any idea on why map isn't removing the undefined and null values I return? (http://jsfiddle.net/JKEs4/1/)
[17:13:41] <clarkk> can someone help me please? I need to get the hash of an anchor.  $(xxx).attr('hash'); does not seem to work
[17:14:43] <mythgarr> wouldn't it just be $(xxx).attr('id')?
[17:15:00] <clarkk> mythgarr: ah, I've found it, I think - it's prop()
[17:15:04] <clarkk> thank you
[17:16:17] <mythgarr> Has anybody used the callback inside map() to remove elements?
[17:20:26] <duch_kazatel> clarkk what do you mean the "hash of an anchor"?
[17:21:14] <clarkk> duch_kazatel: it's a dom property. Thanks, but I've fixed it
[17:21:25] <duch_kazatel> lay..
[17:21:27] <duch_kazatel> *kay..
[17:22:49] <mythgarr> figured it out
[17:24:56] <duch_kazatel> ah clarkk you were looking at the URL hash?
[17:25:17] <clarkk> duch_kazatel: forget about the hash! ;)
[17:25:22] <clarkk> heh, yes
[17:27:42] <duch_kazatel> .prop() likely isn't what you want, then... window.location.hash for the window is "smarter". if you have a clicked URL, you want to parse for the hash symbol and go from there.
[17:27:53] <duch_kazatel> .prop() isn't what you want.
[17:28:41] <clarkk> duch_kazatel: I want the href without the fully qualified path - ie, precisely what is in the html code
[17:29:03] <duch_kazatel> then you want .attr('href');
[17:34:14] <clarkk> duch_kazatel: it means that I have to needlessly wrap the event.target in jquery. What is the advantage?
[17:35:46] <duch_kazatel> .prop() is for object properties.  .attr() is for attributes.
[17:36:30] <duch_kazatel> one makes more sense when reading.
[17:39:56] <MrTrick> So I have four deferred objects; A, B, C, D. However, C can't be initiated until B is complete. Is this correct? $.when( A(), B().then(function() { return C(); }), D() ).done(function() { excellent('...'); });
[17:42:21] <shoky> MrTrick: no
[17:42:36] <shoky> deferred objects are not functions, for starters
[17:46:14] <shoky> MrTrick: tho if you mean functions that return a deferred then that's right ;p
[17:47:13] <MrTrick> pedant. :-P
[17:47:27] <shoky> sorry, it threw me off at first
[17:48:11] <MrTrick> I changed the examples to functions to make it clearer that C's promise didn't have to have been built yet.
[17:48:21] <shoky> btw you could do  B().then(C)
[17:48:57] <MrTrick> well, how could I construct C if I can't actually send the request until I have info fetched by B?
[17:49:42] <MrTrick> or does it work that C is a function that returns a promise?
[17:50:19] <shoky> well, the argument(s) to C will be the info fetched by B
[17:53:20] <RadListControl1> why does jquery use the $ symbol?
[17:53:56] <duch_kazatel> guide_X because it's convenient.
[17:54:11] <guide_X> is it because you can make lots of money coding in jquery, or because you can save money not typing jQuery
[17:54:21] <guide_X> just wondering if it maybe is an inside joke or something
[17:54:56] <shoky> that was weird, nick-wise
[18:00:08] <MrTrick> thanks shoky. Not sure I want to pipe the arguments through this time (B and C are from a library and expect other arguments) but it's good to know.
[18:00:46] <guide_X> anyone know why jquery chosen .trigger("liszt:updated"); wouldn't work?
[18:37:15] <reZo> Hello, could someone please recommend or direct me to a content slider? Just need the capability to slide a div with paragraphs, headers in it automatically.
[18:38:56] <duch_kazatel> you mean like a carousel?
[18:41:18] <reZo> Yes please.
[18:43:32] <duch_kazatel> i've used bxSlider (I think it was called), but I always reccomend that people don't use sliders in the first place.
[18:43:37] <jeremy--> Is there any way to stop the change of a select value without using the 'disabled' attribute.. I want to be able to display an error using a select field with jquery.validate and jquery.validate ignores disabled fields
[18:43:43] <jeremy--> select input*
[18:44:22] <duch_kazatel> jeremy-- why would you prevent the user from selecting something?
[18:44:22] <Japella> jeremy why would you prevent the user from selecting something? now has -1 karma
[18:44:46] <reZo> duch_kazatel, thanks very much :)
[18:44:49] <duch_kazatel> wtf that's a new bot.
[18:45:00] <duch_kazatel> reZo http://shouldiuseacarousel.com/
[18:45:02] <duch_kazatel> read that.
[18:45:08] <reZo> Legend
[18:45:17] <reZo> LOL!
[18:45:49] <duch_kazatel> seriously though don't use them.
[18:45:57] <jeremy--> Its for an internal CRM system, imagine there is a field that says "requires requote", and it will display a jquery.validate error on submission if the value is Yes not No
[18:46:09] <reZo> I'll have a talk to my client and see if we can work something out,
[18:46:21] <jeremy--> this requires requote field is only set programmatically by the system, the advantage of using it means I can do all error control using jquery.validate
[18:46:30] <reZo> Valid point about missing content though, having to read very fast.
[18:46:55] <duch_kazatel> jeremy err, shouldn't the backend automatically handle that for you?
[18:48:01] <jeremy--> if the consultant is on the phone with somebody, and something changes and requires the consultant to requote / calculate the price
[18:48:15] <jeremy--> you would want to discuss that on the front-end / client-side
[18:48:34] <duch_kazatel> why throw an error if they can choose?
[18:48:51] <jeremy--> Why are you arguing with me about UI when you have no idea on context
[18:49:09] <jeremy--> I could just as easily make it a disabled input with yes/no
[18:49:28] <jeremy--> The point of the matter is that if i use any input be it select/input, then i can pipe the error using jquery validate
[18:49:42] <jeremy--> which because the entire system is built on jquery validate with over 100 fields, thats beneficial to me for several reasons
[18:50:19] <jeremy--> I'm investigating using the readonly attribute which wont be skipped by jquery.validate
[18:50:19] <duch_kazatel> just pointing out the problem seems strange.  i always always apprecaite when people come to me to say "maybe you're looking at the problem wrong".
[18:50:20] <duch_kazatel> that's all.
[18:50:22] <jeremy--> i think this might work
[18:53:23] <duch_kazatel> i also get stuck in the mindset of "always validate in the backend, frontend is secondary".
[18:53:50] <coldhead> validate everywhere, at all times
[19:13:16] <scarlet_razor> im using many library / plugin that heavily using jquery, the problem is the library itself using single different ver of jquery
[19:13:48] <scarlet_razor> how to using or load different ver of jquery without conflicting the others library ?
[19:13:54] <scarlet_razor> any suggest ?
[19:14:14] <Velveeta> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/
[19:14:24] <coldhead> scarlet_razor: tutorial form http://learn.jquery.com/using-jquery-core/avoid-conflicts-other-libraries/
[19:14:42] <coldhead> just think of the other library as a different version of jQ
[19:15:22] <scarlet_razor> coldhead: i read it out
[19:51:40] <MrTrick> Is there a better way of creating a pre-resolved deferred than $.when() ?
[19:53:05] <MrTrick> $.Deferred.resolve() works, I suppose...?
[20:17:05] <Manusoftar> is there a way to use the load function with a querystring, i mean passing arguments using GET?
[20:48:04] <RonWhoCares> Am I missing something obvious?  I am not sure why this code:    $('#notepad').val();   does NOT empty (clear) the field:   <textarea name="notepad" id="notepad" class="acts_ministries_christian_evangelism_ledger_create_ledger_entry_user_textarea_field"></textarea>
[20:52:19] <pneftali> val('')
[20:52:26] <macmartine> RonWhoCares: Because you're simply getting the value
[20:52:45] <RonWhoCares> oh bother
[20:52:47] <RonWhoCares> Thank you
[20:53:30] <macmartine> you just quoted winnie the pooh, that rules
[20:54:24] <RonWhoCares> Thank you
[21:22:51] <tigrang> I'm having an issue with finding elements. Using pure js, console.log(document.getElementById('playlist').getElementsByClassName('sp-list-item')); I can see all the results, with console.log($('#playlist').find('.sp-list-item')); I get no results
[21:28:45] <tigrang> However, setTimeout(function() {  console.log($('#playlist').find('.sp-list-item')); }); works
[21:57:34] <sayd> when would a change event not fire? i have an input with a blur and a change handler. i type in the input and blur. the blur handler fired, but change does not
[21:57:51] <sayd> also have a keyup and focus handlers which both fire
[21:58:46] <sayd> the change handler does seem to fire when i change the field and click off it, but not tab
[21:59:16] <fgh> the change is set to fire when it's value changes
[21:59:47] <fgh> for the case of input elem that is
[22:00:29] <sayd> i think i narrowed the reason
[22:00:57] <sayd> its seemingly coming from the jqueryvalidation library. the validator is using the onkeyup:false option
[22:01:18] <sayd> which apparently swallows change events on tab ;/
[22:02:03] <fgh> tab shouldnt be triggering change events for input
[22:02:30] <sayd> fgh: well if the value changes i would think it would
[22:02:45] <fgh> yes that would
[22:03:00] <fgh> does that not trigger the event as well?
[22:05:04] <sayd> it seems to now.. weird
[22:05:12] <beasty> morning
[22:37:32] <Ayudame> Is anyone able to tell me how to publish a jquery plugin via gitshell on windows?
[22:43:55] <scottstamp> Can someone please help me before I murder this JSON request?
[22:44:08] <scottstamp> I'm trying to request a jsonp URL but I get cookies sent along with the request.
[22:44:17] <scottstamp> And it's totally screwing up my timestamps.
[22:52:20] <scottstamp> Anybody? :(
[22:52:38] <scottstamp> http://jsfiddle.net/pDYZd/2/ this is my code, I'm trying to set the cookie's value to null but it doesn't change the request.
[22:57:21] * scottstamp * :( *
[22:58:16] <Zak> taking a peek
[22:59:20] <scottstamp> Thanks Zak. *hug*
[22:59:55] <Zak> scottstamp: you won't be able to modify the cookies associated with another host/port/schema
[23:00:30] <scottstamp> Crap! So because they're sending me back cookies, my code can't change it?
[23:00:39] <scottstamp> Can I deny the cookie in the response?
[23:00:46] <Zak> no, i don't think so
[23:01:00] <Zak> there... might be a way to stop them from being sent. i dunno
[23:01:08] <scottstamp> urgh. Well that kind of defeats the purpose of the last 40 minutes of my life, if it is the case.
[23:01:08] <Zak> this is sort of a CORS thing
[23:01:21] <Zak> because the cookies are usually associated with the host/domain etc
[23:02:02] <scottstamp> >:( drat.
[23:02:47] <Zak> if the API allows it.. it might be able to set certain cookies for you.. if thats helpful
[23:02:59] <Zak> but i sort of doubt that would exist
[23:03:03] <Zak> what's the problem you're hitting?
[23:03:32] <scottstamp> Zak, because it sets the play_token cookie, my request to get a new one (immediately after start) is useless
[23:03:39] <scottstamp> it just returns the play_token value from my cookie
[23:04:01] <scottstamp> Maybe if I read to end it'll fix it... hang on a sec.
[23:04:34] <Zak> seems like a problem with 8track's API then?
[23:04:43] <scottstamp> It kind of is, but at the same time it's not.
[23:04:51] <scottstamp> I'm not notifying it that I've played the last track.
[23:05:02] <scottstamp> And they don't really "allow" replaying mixes in the same order, or going back a song
[23:05:09] <Zak> oh I see... :P
[23:05:19] <scottstamp> heh. That worked.
[23:05:22] <Zak> scottstamp: is this for your own project?
[23:05:32] <Zak> or are you trying to integrate something yourself
[23:05:55] <Zak> if you're just doing this for your own personal reasons, I would look into nodejs
[23:06:03] <Zak> you could proxy any requests with whatever cookies you wanted
[23:06:23] <scottstamp> Crap. "We're sorry, our music license requires us to limit the number of times you can play a particular mix in an 8-hour period."
[23:06:36] <Zak> i would look at the nodejs solution :)
[23:06:41] <scottstamp> Yeah proxying is going to have to be my only option, but I wanted to launch it for a bit more than personal reasons.
[23:06:47] <Zak> then you can set the cookies however you want, because you won't hit rhe CORs issue
[23:06:49] <scottstamp> Check out http://atetracks.ca/
[23:07:03] <scottstamp> I'm basically redeveloping that in JavaScript to take the strain away from my servers.
[23:07:11] <Zak> ah cool
[23:07:21] <Zak> well good luck
[23:07:31] <scottstamp> Thanks.
[23:07:36] <scottstamp> At least I won't have to do processing on my own.
[23:07:44] <scottstamp> I guess I could keep a local storage cache
[23:08:13] <scottstamp> Not having a wait time to load pages will be cool too.
[23:08:18] <Zak> there's limits on local storage and the if you want to support certain versions of IE, that will be a problem :)
[23:08:37] <Zak> you might want to take a look at what youtube did recently to speed up page loads
[23:08:54] <Zak> i don't know if you're hitting the same sort of issues, but i just figure that music is sort of similar to video
[23:09:11] <scottstamp> Not quite, I'm serving a lot of meta data straight from my system.
[23:09:17] <scottstamp> also O_O
[23:09:22] <scottstamp> WHAT JUST HAPPENED
[23:09:39] <Zak> here's a video: http://vimeo.com/68855337
[23:10:03] <scottstamp> Did anyone else just see like EVERYBODY disconnect?
[23:14:47] <scottstamp> Zak, http://jsfiddle.net/pDYZd/4/
[23:14:58] <scottstamp> This fixes it, until I run into the "You've played this too many times" error
[23:16:53] <bobdobbs> what do I have to know about, in order to attach event handlers to parts of the dom that don't exist yet?
[23:17:25] <bobdobbs> Like, I'm thinking about building a slideshow with lazy-loaded images.
[23:17:37] <scottstamp> I'd think you would need to include a callback in the trigger that creates the DOM element.
[23:17:49] <bobdobbs> hmmm
[23:17:59] <bobdobbs> thanks. I'll experiment with that.
[23:18:03] <bobdobbs> :)
[23:18:10] <scottstamp> No problem. I'm a total noob though. Let me know how it works.
[23:43:18] <__machine> im trying to POST some data with $.ajax() ... but my API endpoint is returning a 400 bad request (along with some JSON data - validation errors)... the `error` callback for $.ajax() doesnt get a `response`, it gets jqXHR, textStatus and errorThrown ... how do i access the JSON from the 400 response?
[23:45:00] <Cork> __machine: $.parseJSON(jqXHR.responseXML)
[23:46:40] <__machine> Cork: i get an error with that.. but when i look at jqXHR it has a responseJSON property... do i just access that directly?
[23:47:26] <Cork> __machine: never heared of responseJSON, so you would have to make sure it works cross browsers
[23:48:56] <__machine> Cork: weird... responseJSON is not mentioned in the jquery docs... but i dont have a response.XML... only responseJSON...
[23:49:48] <Cork> __machine: what about responseText ?
[23:50:19] <__machine> yes i have responseText
[23:50:27] <Cork> hmm actually "response" should work cross browsers too
[23:50:43] <Cork> __machine: then use one of them with $.parseJSON
[23:51:22] <__machine> presumably that gives me the same as responseJSON, which has already been parsed? not sure why it's not in the docs though
[23:51:49] <Cork> __machine: give me a check; it isn't a standard member of xhr
[23:51:59] <Cork> so i'm going to check if jquery generates it
[23:52:08] <Cork> if it doesn't it is a browser specific member
[23:58:09] <Cork> __machine: ok it is a jquery generated member
[23:58:16] <Cork> so it's safe to use
[23:59:56] <__machine> thanks
