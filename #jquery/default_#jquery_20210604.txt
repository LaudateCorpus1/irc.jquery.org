[08:31:38] <Someone_Else> how can I fire an event when an image refuses to load with 403?
[08:31:59] <Someone_Else> the on("error") way does not seem to invoke that way
[09:22:46] <Cork> Someone_Else: on error needs to be assigned to the img element before the element gets the src url
[09:23:16] <Cork> Someone_Else: else the event has a high chance of fiering before the handler is added
[20:13:46] <sydbarret> Which part of the code is resposible for the first header squeare to select all rows?  https://jsfiddle.net/annoyingmouse/yxLrLr8o/
[20:14:48] <robertmaxrees> which do you think it is?
[20:15:14] <robertmaxrees> try commenting things out until it no longer works :)
[20:16:32] <sydbarret> its the first column def but it also includes in row squares
[20:16:42] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[20:16:46] <sydbarret>  className: 'select-checkbox',
[20:16:54] <sydbarret> that line is responsible for it
[20:16:59] <robertmaxrees> that's part of the datatable config.
[20:17:20] <robertmaxrees> that's defining a classname, not the event handler that actually does the work.
[20:19:08] <robertmaxrees> protip: the event handler that starts with example.on("click", "th.select-checkbox", function() { is what does it.
[20:25:27] <sydbarret> already knew that, sorry for the confusion i was talking about the square itself. which code was the one that drew it. Because I have my own datatable that has the squares in the rows but doest show it on the header. Maybe I have another setting that is deleting it
[20:25:44] <robertmaxrees> "deleting it"?
[20:27:22] <sydbarret> yes mine appears as this https://pasteboard.co/K57GDtt.png
[20:27:32] <sydbarret> i cant make it appear the top square
[20:27:37] <sydbarret> the one in the header
[20:27:52] <sydbarret> and its almost the same setting althought i have a few more
[20:28:09] <robertmaxrees> gonna guess it's a selector, config, or css issue.
[20:31:16] <sydbarret> im too tired i will continue tomorrow bye
