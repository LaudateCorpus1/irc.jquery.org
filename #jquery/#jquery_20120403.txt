[00:00:41] <raj> Cork, does this mean I won't need bbq?
[00:00:48] <neersighted> :D
[00:00:51] <raj> can this update single parameters, while leaving others alone?
[00:01:31] <raj> (which is the feature of bbq I liked)
[00:03:27] <neersighted> Well, jQuery is looking awesome already
[00:03:27] <neersighted> :D
[00:13:03] <Xotix> I'm trying to get my pasted text by emptying the div before the paste and get it again. Experiencing problem with safari http://jsfiddle.net/nK4eJ/9/ any idea?
[00:18:41] <Xotix> IE doesn't let me change focus?
[00:23:45] <fRAiLtY-> Grr http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/16/ trying to get this to work, if I select A6 for instance it should select A6 and previous TD's and bg colour them red but it doesn't work! JSLint shows no errors, grrr!
[00:26:54] <jamraiq> is it possible to load third party scripts?
[00:27:39] <jamraiq> i understand it's not possible to load content from another site, but i'm getting mixed messages about loading scripts. it seems to be possible
[00:27:56] <johnkpaul> jamraiq: you mean in a script tag?
[00:28:20] <Cork> jamraiq: you can't load ajax from a separat site, but you can load scripts
[00:28:31] <Cork> jamraiq: so if it works depends on what tecniq your using
[00:29:30] <jamraiq> hmm, well $.getScript() kind of seems to work, but isn't it just $.ajax() in disguise?
[00:29:49] <ChrisTheSorcerer> fRAiLtY-: As far as I see, it doesn't get the regular CSS bg-color either, but that might be a jsFiddle thingy...
[00:29:49] <jamraiq> and it doesn't seem to inject a script tag
[00:29:56] <Cork> jamraiq: it is, and it has support for using the <script> tag
[00:30:36] <larsemil> i am going crazy here, i have done something i just cant get my mind around. http://voidab.destinator.se everything works fine, except that after hovering the timing of the slide is all off.
[00:30:52] <larsemil> if anyone could give me a hint in the correct direction i would be happy
[00:31:10] <jamraiq> okay great, so as long as it's JSONP or a script it's okay cross origin?
[00:34:27] <Cork> jamraiq: jsonp is a script
[00:34:51] <Cork> jamraiq: jsonp is a javascript json like object wrapped in a javascript function sent in a script file
[00:38:53] <fRAiLtY-> ChrisTheSorcerer: How do you mean mate?
[00:39:43] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I mean that it looks like the background should have a different color than the default white in the table, but it doesn't on my screen
[00:40:45] <ChrisTheSorcerer> in .matrix you put the bgcolor to #f6f6f6, but I see no difference ;)
[00:44:35] <raj> Cork, I hate to bother you with this again, but I'm a little confused on implementing History.js. Such as, do I need the code in the "Working with History.js" section? https://github.com/balupton/history.js
[00:44:54] <timing> Hi all! I have an inline datepicker (http://jqueryui.com/demos/datepicker/#inline) and I use altField as well to show a textfield underneath. However, this field isn't really checked on user input, while the normal input field (when using .datepicker() on an input) does have this checking. How can I fix this?
[00:45:09] <jamraiq> thanks
[00:45:38] <Cork> raj: yes, thats where you change the url
[00:45:57] <Cork> History.replaceState({state:3}, "State 3", "?state=3"); or History.pushState({state:1}, "State 1", "?state=1");
[00:46:32] <raj> right, I see those are examples, but I mean above it
[00:46:37] <raj> what's the 'Bind to StateChange Event'?
[00:46:39] <raj> and Prepare?
[00:46:54] <raj> and the whole function(window,undefined)
[00:47:02] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you have an error in your html
[00:47:09] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: attribue129 should be attribute129
[00:47:16] <raj> i've actually never worked with `window`, so I'm not sure if my lack of knowledge stems from that
[00:47:26] <raj> or this plugin specifically
[00:47:39] <Cork> raj: thats the callback that tells you when the user hits back
[00:47:44] <Cork> (or forward)
[00:47:59] <fRAiLtY-> Oh, ChrisTheSorcerer the background is different on mine so it might be youâ€¦ maybe?
[00:48:43] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I've fixed that. still no luck though :x
[00:49:33] <ChrisTheSorcerer> fRAiLtY-: Probably, this comp is ancient ;) I've been playing around with the CSS and JS without any luck... Can get the bg to change manually, but not with the event trigger you have.
[00:49:45] <raj> statechange event is when the user hits back?
[00:49:49] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: what part is it you want to change?
[00:49:57] <Cork> the A6 column?
[00:50:57] <fRAiLtY-> ChrisTheSorcerer: Cork the column that's selected from the drop down, so if I select A6, it selects the A6 and all previous TD's, then the same on the quantities.. see here: http://www.solopress.com/flyers/flyer-printing.html select size first, then qty and you'll see what I mean on the table below
[00:52:17] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Yeah, kinda thought that was the idea... thou I have no luck with it...
[00:52:30] <fRAiLtY-> Me neither :x
[00:55:07] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/19/
[00:58:03] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: This is why I'm hanging on this channel! I want to learn to do those things too ^_^
[00:59:44] <Cork> if i did it my self from scratch i would prob have used classes instead of col, but ya, it works
[01:08:22] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Does row group exist ?
[01:08:51] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: uh... tr?
[01:08:58] <Cork> :d
[01:12:12] <xec> well, thead, tfoot and tbody are groups of rows
[01:12:53] <xec> you can have multiple tbody in a table
[01:14:50] <coldhead> its probably not a good idea to do so
[01:15:02] <coldhead> in the same way you would avoid multiple <body>s
[01:15:11] <itsmikerudolph> anyone run into issues with jquery on iphone not working with .fadein, .fadeout and animate, but stuff like .hide and .show works fine :S
[01:15:43] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: The problem I've got is the tables are dynamically created, so I don't know how many cols there are going to be until it's generated :x
[01:15:46] <Cork> itsmikerudolph: do you have the effect library loaded?
[01:16:14] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ya, so use classes on the cells instead
[01:16:24] <xec> coldhead: what?
[01:16:30] <fRAiLtY-> So each cell has the same class?
[01:16:38] <itsmikerudolph> @Cork yes
[01:16:44] <itsmikerudolph> works fine in all other browsers
[01:16:45] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: every cell in the same column yes
[01:16:51] <xec> coldhead: there's nothing wrong with multiple tbody, but multiple body tags would be invalid
[01:16:54] <simtsit> is it easy to import this jquery code in a drupal site? http://www.jeremymartin.name/projects.php?project=kwicks
[01:17:14] <Cork> itsmikerudolph: your getting any errors?
[01:17:43] <itsmikerudolph> @Cork no errors :S
[01:18:01] <Cork> itsmikerudolph: what version of jquery?
[01:18:32] <coldhead> i don't like the asymmetery, xec. a table can have as many tbody as a document can have bodys
[01:18:52] <itsmikerudolph> @Cork 1.6.2
[01:19:02] <xec> coldhead: that's just not true. one <body> per document and any number of <tbody> per table
[01:19:07] <Cork> itsmikerudolph: have you tried with a clean test case?
[01:19:14] <coldhead> MAYBE ACCORDING TO THE SPEC XEC
[01:19:19] <coldhead> I AM TALKING ABOUT MY HEART
[01:19:22] <Cork> itsmikerudolph: so its not a css rule messing things up for you?
[01:19:34] <xec> lol
[01:19:40] * xec hugs coldhead
[01:19:42] <itsmikerudolph> @Cork nope its not the css rule

[01:21:21] <vectorshelve> Whenever user types in something on a new form fields and clicks on anyother link or button (cancel) other than submit button I need to alert them that (your data will be lost ) and then a button for yes or no to cancel or retain the form.. how can I do it ?
[01:21:59] <itsmikerudolph> @Cork I do have jquery mobile loaded also, as I am calling this "effect" on slideleft, now at first I thought that was the issue so I just set it on a click function, even that wouldn't work
[01:22:37] <itsmikerudolph> "swipeleft not slideleft **
[01:23:36] <vectorshelve> Cork: ^^ help :)
[01:23:49] <Jhon> JqueryMobile> i have a menu button. when use clicks on this button menu list (ul) is toggled. But when I load a new page with data-ajax= true. menu button click event is fired twice. can anybody tell me why it is fired twice?
[01:24:20] <Cork> itsmikerudolph: this wfm, how is it for you http://jsfiddle.net/FfcEg/1/ ?
[01:24:52] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Ok, so I have my json-encoder almost ready, but I need a way for it to execute a function if it encounters it... Is there any way to do that? (An object with one or more functions in it)
[01:25:24] <Jhon> any body can help me?
[01:25:27] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: uh json can't have functions
[01:25:57] <ChrisTheSorcerer> like if(post[x].contains('function')){execute function code here, return value of result to the JSON}
[01:26:01] <Jhon> @Cork any help? u seems to be most active member right now :)
[01:26:05] <itsmikerudolph> @Cork dammit that works
[01:26:10] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I know, Cork, that's why I need to execute the function before
[01:26:30] <PavelloZ> about tbody, its quite interresting, look at that: http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.3
[01:26:46] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: you chould check if its a function and execute it if it is
[01:26:46] <Jhon> In JqueryMobile i have a menu button. when use clicks on this button, a menu list (ul) is toggled. But when I load a new page with data-ajax= true. menu button click event is fired twice. can anybody tell me why it is fired twice?
[01:27:04] <ChrisTheSorcerer> It's things like position of an image relative to its background... for some stupid reason, instead of having the coordinates there, it has a function that calculates the position
[01:27:42] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Yeah, that's what I'm trying to do, but I don't know how to... If the position is a function, I can write the function out, but how do I get the code to read it as a function instead of a string?
[01:28:06] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: btw why don't you just preprocess the functions and use JSON.serialize?
[01:28:18] <Cork> *stringify
[01:29:07] <ChrisTheSorcerer> because I don't know how to do that... and I can't use the default JSON.serialize, because the objects contains other objects that points to themselves and yet other objects... that's why I made my own encoder, to remove those object refs
[01:29:21] <recentlydeceased> hey folks, having a weird bug where a slideDown animation only completes fully when Chromium inspector is open, any ideas what it might be?
[01:29:51] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: So what your saying is, cells in col1 would be classed as td1, and cells in col2 as td2 and so on?
[01:31:51] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: http://jsfiddle.net/2pc6N/
[01:32:19] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i would give it more specific names then that, but ya, that would work too
[01:32:53] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: the reason is that you want to have classes as its much faster to select on, and a table can have quite a lot of cells in them
[01:33:02] <Cork> so the speed difference really matters
[01:35:00] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Presumably at this point the classes don't need to be styled either, it's just for selection purposes?
[01:35:28] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ya, i would prob use a class for setting the color though
[01:35:34] <Cork> like "selected" or "active"
[01:35:57] <Cork> makes it cleaner to reset the color
[01:36:20] <Cork> jQuery('.active').removeClass('active')
[01:36:41] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: So if it was you, and that was your table, what would you name them?
[01:36:52] <fRAiLtY-> I've got to do it through PHP as that's how the table is generated
[01:37:04] <vectorshelve> Cork: Whenever user types in something on a new form fields and clicks on anyother link or button (cancel) other than submit button I need to alert them that (your data will be lost ) and then a button for yes or no to cancel or retain the form.. how can I do it ?
[01:37:14] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: it depends on what you have as reference, you don't have any values on your options
[01:37:40] <fRAiLtY-> I know, again I'm using Magento so it creates them how it feels, so I'm working with what I have
[01:37:45] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: but i would prob call them something referencing the column in the database or similar
[01:37:52] <fRAiLtY-> Best of "bad" situation sorta thing
[01:38:03] <kevindougans> can anyone spare 2 mins to suggest my next step in debugging an ie8/jquery issue i'm having thats only in ie8 on my site, but on the demo of the plugin ie8 works fine
[01:38:06] <Larholm> ChrisTheSorcerer, I would rethink your data exchange and separate the data objects from your object function instances so you can actually use JSON with primitives
[01:38:45] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: i would ex. create a class name with no upercase and space replaced with dash of the title from the column
[01:38:50] <Larholm> kevindougans, make a simplified test case by removing stuff until the problem no longer reproduces. Start removing HTML and CSS that is not part of making the plugin work
[01:38:53] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: and set that as value on the option too
[01:38:54] <kevindougans> http://test.cafemamboibiza.com/en - the 360 tour not he left beside the paris hilton video doesn't work in ie
[01:39:03] <kevindougans> i meant to say ie9, not ie8 sorry
[01:39:16] <kevindougans> ok larholm i'll give it a try
[01:39:40] <Cork> vectorshelve: you would have to check if the fields has changed
[01:39:52] <Cork> vectorshelve: and if they have show ex a confirm dialog
[01:40:16] <vectorshelve> Cork: any code available
[01:40:36] <Cork> not that i know of
[01:40:53] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Larholm: Could you take that again, but in english this time?
[01:41:02] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I can't set a value on the options, it's using Magento which uses prototype so god knows really how it creates and renders them!?
[01:41:08] <fRAiLtY-> Does this effect the classing?
[01:42:08] <Larholm> ChrisTheSorcerer, make a new object for the data you want to send instead of reusing the object that you already have with functions on it
[01:42:11] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: ouch, yes it does
[01:42:20] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: Damn
[01:42:29] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: so then you would want to use an index based class name
[01:42:35] <Cork> something like what you used before
[01:42:44] <fRAiLtY-> td1 etc sorta thing?
[01:43:00] <Cork> col0 col1 col2 ya
[01:43:09] <Cork> start at zero
[01:43:14] <fRAiLtY-> Oh, the colgroup you mean?
[01:43:22] <Cork> no
[01:43:40] <fRAiLtY-> I see, just class the cells differently in each col
[01:43:48] <Cork> the class reprecents the column so lets at least have the name describe that
[01:43:53] <Cork> yes
[01:44:05] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I haven't made the functions, and there's no way for me to know from the start what positions will be using functions. It's dynamically created objects on a canvas using a toolset called KineticJS, and it seems to pop out functions at random... Some have a constant for valueX, while others have a function there. Some have a function for imgSrc, while others have the path to the image...
[01:44:14] <Cork> then you can do .find('col' + $(this).index)
[01:44:30] <elHannes> hi folks, it seems that i can't remove the required attribute (via jquery) using firefox ..anyone any idea?
[01:44:45] <Cork> ChrisTheSorcerer: didn't the example i gave you work?
[01:44:53] <fRAiLtY-> Ok Cork, will give that a try and report back
[01:45:08] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: I haven't tried it yet, just trying to figure out what Larholm meant first
[01:45:08] <Cork> sorry $(this).index()
[01:52:50] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Cork: I'll have to sit down and analyze what you pasted. I've said it many times before, and I really mean it... I'm a complete n00b when it comes to jQuery, but I'll get there ;)
[01:53:27] <Xotix> When doing feature detection, can i somehow surpress the error?

[02:05:41] <xec> ?on @ rwoverdijk
[02:05:42] <bot-t> rwoverdijk, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[02:06:03] <xec> rwoverdijk: what you're after is the delegation part, i assume
[02:06:18] <Jhon_> rwoverdijk: can you please see my issue?
[02:07:15] <Xotix> Larholm thanks
[02:07:16] <Jhon_> xec: any help?
[02:07:25] <xec> ?demo @ Jhon_

[02:10:42] <rwoverdijk> xec: I can't seem to find the live binding in the docs.
[02:10:59] <xec> rwoverdijk: you don't need it, all you need is love
[02:11:03] <xec> rwoverdijk: i mean .on()
[02:11:52] <xec> rwoverdijk: if you tell us what you're trying to do, maybe we can be more specific ;)
[02:13:18] <rwoverdijk> xec: Exactly what I'm saying. I want to automagically attach events to newly created elements. I'm using jquery mobile, and I'd like to perform an action on pagecreate. The thing is that this required me to actively search for newly created [data-role="page"] elements.
[02:14:22] <itsmikerudolph> so I have this call: $(this).hide("slide", { direction: "right" }, 500);
[02:14:29] <itsmikerudolph> and its working, but its getting fired twice?
[02:14:46] <Jhon_> bot-t http://jsfiddle.net/LY7LF/

[02:16:56] <Jhon_> you can get some idea of how it should work
[02:17:17] <theCole> does anyone know how greater than and less than work when comparing objects?

[02:17:37] <theCole> {"foo":1} > {"bar": 6}
[02:23:55] <rwoverdijk> xec: I did read them, but I don't like it. I've figured something else out. Thanks anyway :)
[02:25:17] <Xotix> How does IE9 and focus() behave? Somehow i don't get it. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.
[02:26:02] <Cork> theCole: it doesn't
[02:26:15] <Cork> theCole: when your comparing objects, your comparing object id's

[02:43:11] <Xotix> DelTree: ups, of coruse i meant var foo = '';
[02:43:29] <xec> then yes
[02:43:37] <DelTree> but why spend a var ?
[02:43:37] <Xotix> hhmm ok thanks
[02:45:24] <theCole> Cork, what do you mean by and objects id?
[02:45:31] <theCole> an*
[02:45:54] <Cork> theCole: the reference number the browser uses to find the objects data
[02:46:04] <Cork> theCole: its like a memory pointer
[02:46:14] <Cork> theCole: in other words, its nothing you can compare
[02:46:32] <theCole> Cork, awesome, that you for answering my question
[02:46:42] <Cork> np
[02:47:05] <Cork> theCole: slight correction, it can be compared
[02:47:17] <Cork> if the two variables point to the exact same object
[02:47:49] <Cork> ?eval var o1 = {}, o2; o2 = o1; o1 == o2
[02:47:50] <theCole> so what if it is an instance of the same object
[02:47:51] <bot-t> Cork: true
[02:47:57] <theCole> just twi different ones
[02:48:00] <theCole> two*
[02:48:31] <Cork> ?eval var o1 = {}, o2; o2 = o1; o2.test = 'yup'; o1
[02:48:32] <bot-t> Cork: {"test": "yup"}
[02:50:05] <Xotix> Can it be that the implementation of onPaste for ie8,9 sucks?
[03:08:46] <juho3> I seem to have a problem with Drag & drop and jquery ui. When I drop an element onto a div inside a container that is margin 0 auto it drops it into a totally wrong position
[03:09:01] <juho3> http://haaveri.org/~juho3/jstest/
[03:09:03] <juho3> check that out
[03:09:21] <juho3> if i remove margin: 0 auto it will drop into the correct position
[03:11:05] <kevindougans> hey can anyone think why my jQuery panoramic plugin (http://test.cafemamboibiza.com/en/ibiza#ui-tabs-4) will only let me scroll once and not click to scroll again inside my site even though when i have it standalone (http://test.cafemamboibiza.com/pan.html) it works as expected
[03:12:23] <itsmikerudolph> hey @cork I figured out that issue I was having with that animate on iphone
[03:12:56] <itsmikerudolph> I was animating the left property trying to get the element to slide off the page, turns out you can't do that (at least I think) so I just did a slide effect on hide
[03:14:34] <vectorshelve> I am recording actions using selenium IDE for (firefox plugin) but I am not able to record the type action into tinymce Rich Text Editor.. how can I make that work ?
[03:20:28] <Xotix> Can't i focus a hidden element?
[03:21:06] <timing> Xotix: do you ask blind people to focus on a certain object?
[03:22:14] <juho3> Anyone have any idea why items jump the amount of the page margin when I drag them onto the grid here: http://haaveri.org/~juho3/jstest
[03:22:14] <itsmikerudolph> I have not tried it before, and I believe the jquery doc only mentions IE will throw an error, so I would assume its somewhat possible in other browsers, though I am not sure why you would want to :S
[03:22:15] <Xotix> Do you ask human beings to calculate 3d graphics realtime? No. But ur right doesn't probably make that much of sense. :)
[03:22:19] <juho3> someone have a look please
[03:22:36] <juho3> the problem isn't there if i take off margin: 0 auto from the container

[04:35:01] <hExDj> thanks poo
[04:35:01] <nights``> i hate IE
[04:35:07] <nights``> such unpredictability
[04:35:10] <cybuch> Hello
[04:35:14] <nights``> sometimes it works and sometimes not
[04:35:19] <nights``> who invented this piece of shit.
[04:35:23] <```poo> ^^
[04:36:03] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Oh, hai nights
[04:36:06] <cybuch> Could some verify if this will work? http://pastebin.com/0AZGwvGq
[04:36:38] <```poo> it'll do what it says
[04:36:56] <xec> cybuch: there is nothing with ID "AJDI"
[04:36:57] <cybuch> well I wrote it, but didn't test it yet
[04:37:10] <xec> cybuch: so, of course we can't verify, why don't you try it and see :P
[04:37:11] <cybuch> xec: because I'm asking in theory ; )
[04:37:31] <simtsit> i try add javascript in my_theme_name.info with scripts[] = foo.js . where i should copy foo.js?
[04:37:46] <cybuch> xec: If there is radio button checked with id="AJDI" the element with id="AJDI-INNE" will be hidden, Am I right?
[04:38:52] <xec> cybuch: maybe
[04:40:11] <cybuch> xec: As you glanced at it - anything could be wrong in the code? Nothing's missing? It's my first code written in jQ
[04:40:31] <```poo> cybuch just test it
[04:40:38] <```poo> we're not you're testers
[04:40:47] <```poo> anyway it's better to use .prop than .attr  for that
[04:40:59] <xec> cybuch: i would use .is(":checked")
[04:41:08] <cybuch> ```poo: Yes I'm aware of that ; ) I just wanted short review or protips
[04:41:23] <juho3> I have a draggable element that I'm cloning when I drop it. How do I move that element by the amount of pixels defined in some variable?
[04:41:34] <juho3> before it's applied on to the droppable div
[04:41:35] <xec> but it's still just going to be at page load - do you expect it to change when the checkbox is unchecked?
[04:41:37] <```poo> if you want protips then post a fiddle demonstrating your problem
[04:41:48] <xec> if not, why do you have both hide and show - surely one is the default
[04:41:53] <cybuch> xec: so condition would look like: ("#AJDI").is(":checked")===true) ?
[04:42:09] <xec> cybuch: .is() returns a boolean so you don't need === true
[04:42:24] <juho3> I can't post JSfiddle but check this out: http://haaveri.org/~juho3/jstest/ elements here don't drop on to the place where they're dropped
[04:42:35] <xec> cybuch: but its much easier to see with a live pastebin like jsfiddle.net http://jsfiddle.net/kwU7G/
[04:42:35] <juho3> they drop x amount of pixels to the left, depending on how wide the margin is
[04:42:38] <cybuch> xec: thanks ; )
[04:42:45] <juho3> If i don't center the container div they drop into the correct positions
[04:42:55] <```poo> === true wouldn't work with .attr() anyway
[04:43:24] <juho3> If someone would take a peek at that i'd be eternally grateful :)
[04:43:49] <juho3> Been fighting the problem for quite some time now
[04:43:57] <juho3> yes i know it
[04:44:03] <juho3> it's horrible code :P
[04:45:46] <```poo> juho3 fiddle it
[04:45:57] <```poo> you'll probably figure it out before you finish
[04:47:13] <juho3> The problem is essentially that if I have a container that has a div in it and it's positioned with margin: 0 auto, and I drag an element on a div inside the container
[04:47:17] <juho3> it won't drop where I drop it
[04:48:26] <```poo> it is this essence of the problem that you should capture in a jsfiddle.
[04:48:33] <juho3> mmh
[04:49:05] <cybuch> OK I've tried to run it, but it fails somehow: http://jsfiddle.net/kwU7G/1/
[04:50:28] <cybuch> shouldn't I just put there <script ...> with the script below?
[04:50:34] <```poo> it does work
[04:50:39] <```poo> it's not checked on DOM ready
[04:50:52] <```poo> also you're missing a quote
[04:51:50] <cybuch> Yep I saw the missing quotation
[04:52:18] <cybuch> but it doesnt work for me ; o
[04:52:20] <xec> cybuch: it's only run once, at document ready, i assume you want it to update any time you change the radio button?
[04:52:22] <```poo> it looks like it will become a very sophisticated app
[04:52:28] <cybuch> xec: yes
[04:52:45] <xec> cybuch: then you could listen to change event, i believe
[04:52:55] <cybuch> ```poo: :) I just want to help my friend who need simple script like that
[04:53:33] <```poo> cybuch: http://jsfiddle.net/kwU7G/2/
[04:53:53] <```poo> tho you kinda lose the option to show it once you hide it :P
[04:54:24] <cybuch> Ye I see
[04:54:57] <cybuch> ```poo: But there's going to be several options so if ID will be unchecked the ID-2b-hidden will be shown aight?
[04:55:27] <```poo> ye
[04:55:40] <```poo> if they all have the same name attribute
[04:56:14] <xec> not if you listen to click on #ID
[04:56:47] <cybuch> ```poo: They've got different, but from group of radio buttons only 1 might be 'activated' so there shouldnt be problem?
[04:57:14] <```poo> xec is right
[04:59:29] <```poo> better like this http://jsfiddle.net/kwU7G/3/
[04:59:37] <cambazz> hello, when i use the browser back button, what could be the reason for $(doc).ready not to execute in a page
[04:59:59] <cambazz> in some pages i made, it works, and in one it does not, and i could not quite figure it out
[05:01:19] <cybuch> The idea of script is following: My friend has got an online shop hosted on Open Cart, but he's using custom modules for shipping and payment. When somebody checks the option f.e. UPS paid in the advance as the shipping method he's still able to check different payment method in payment methods. There like 8 shipping methods and 2 payment methods and I want to use jscript/jquery to make sure, that there will be aviable only the proper payment
[05:01:19] <cybuch> method. All have different IDs/Values.
[05:02:15] <```poo> cybuch: best to give all the related radio buttons a shared class
[05:02:32] <```poo> then just  $('.className').change(...)
[05:03:12] <cybuch> ```poo: They're generated by php and I'm not sure if it's possible
[05:04:01] <```poo> well, what i fiddled will select all radio buttons..
[05:04:56] <cybuch> ```poo: doesn't it selected only radio buttons with proper ID?
[05:05:40] <```poo> $('input[type="radio"]') will select all radio buttons
[05:05:45] <xec> cybuch: surely someone is writing the php
[05:06:12] <xec> cybuch: but if you cannot control the html, you could select on name attribute as well http://jsfiddle.net/kwU7G/4/
[05:06:47] <Xotix> hi
[05:06:52] <xec> i just copypasted the ID, but hopefully you get the point ;)
[05:07:03] <```poo> HI
[05:07:06] <```poo> HELO
[05:07:18] <xec> EHLO
[05:07:38] <cybuch> xec: and ofcourse name="test" may be changed to value="test" ?
[05:07:52] <xec> what? name is not the same as value
[05:08:19] <thomaslfromz> beginners question: $(this) is <li id="foo">sg</li> how do I get foo? var iwant = $(this)something
[05:08:24] <Xotix> I'm changing focus to a contenteditable div onPaste. Then i get div.Text() so the formatting is gone. this works. when my div is visible but if i do position: absolute; left: âˆ’10000px; it doesn't work anymore or i should rather say, the formatting doesn't get cleanedUp, why?
[05:08:33] <xec> cybuch: i suggest you read some basic tutorials, google for how to make radio buttons with html
[05:09:03] <xec> thomaslfromz: this.id ?
[05:09:22] <```poo> nono he wants $(this)something
[05:09:24] <```poo> =
[05:09:24] <cybuch> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/kwU7G/5/ => It's working, thats what I've meant
[05:09:59] <```poo> you can check more than one at a time ;P
[05:10:14] <xec> cybuch: what the hell, you got the same value for both radio buttons
[05:10:17] <xec> cybuch: why
[05:10:24] <cybuch> xec: for test purposes only
[05:10:32] <xec> cybuch: makes no sense
[05:10:53] <cybuch> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/kwU7G/6/ now it doesnt work properly
[05:11:13] <xec> cybuch: no shit
[05:11:23] <```poo> stop fiddling, start working
[05:11:35] <```poo> then if you're stuck later, fiddle again
[05:12:11] <xec> cybuch: i ask again, why on earth are you selecting on value?
[05:12:52] <cybuch> xec: because in HTML i've got 2 fix name value is shared
[05:13:23] <thomaslfromz> yes $(this).attr('id') works $(this).id not
[05:13:48] <xec> cybuch: which is a good thing, you want to listen to change on any radio button, so the event is triggered when you click on *any* of the radio buttons. WHAT you hide is up the logic inside
[05:13:59] <xec> thomaslfromz: not $(this).id but this.id
[05:14:23] <cybuch> xec: I'm goin to draw the shit for you :D
[05:14:23] <timing> hi!
[05:14:36] <timing> is the form[action] attribute an attr or a prop?
[05:14:41] <thomaslfromz> this.id is faster than attrib I guess?
[05:14:47] <Xotix> is there some max left, top value i can give? Are the dimensions limited? Can it be possible that an element g et's lost when i do left âˆ’10000px
[05:14:52] <Cork> timing: both
[05:15:07] <Cork> timing: attribute is whats in the html, action is whats on the dom element
[05:15:16] <thomaslfromz> Xotix:  define get lost? out of sight?
[05:15:31] <timing> Cork: so how do I change it? with attr() or prop()
[05:15:36] <xec> thomaslfromz: yes, why use jquery for something native javascript does out of the box
[05:15:43] <Cork> timing: again, both works
[05:15:47] <timing> hmm ok
[05:15:54] <Cork> timing: whats in the differ a bit though
[05:16:10] <```poo> them*
[05:16:15] <Cork> prop will contain a fqdn while attr might be a relative path
[05:16:33] <Xotix> thomaslfromz: hmm onPaste I'm focusing div X. then take the text from div X and paste it in the origin div. This works when the div X is normally displayed but it don't if i do left: âˆ’100px;
[05:16:58] <```poo> fqdn? huh
[05:17:06] <Xotix> thomaslfromz: althought the pasting works, so it must see the div. But it remains with the formatting.
[05:17:10] <Cork> Fully Qualified Domain Name
[05:17:14] <```poo> yeah
[05:17:23] <```poo> sorry, thought you were saying that to someone else ;)
[05:17:28] <```poo> about top and left ;p
[05:17:33] <Cork> :)
[05:17:45] <cambazz> what other options do we have other than location.href = `someurl`
[05:17:55] <cambazz> it appears that it breaks the back button
[05:17:58] <Cork> ?mdc location
[05:18:00] <bot-t> Cork, window.location - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Returns a Location object , which contains information about the URL of the document and provides methods for changing that URL. You can also assign to this property to load another URL. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.location
[05:18:05] <```poo> console.log('hellow world') is an option

[05:29:37] <xec> cybuch: http://jsfiddle.net/kwU7G/8/
[05:30:54] <cybuch> xec: http://jsfiddle.net/kwU7G/9/
[05:31:47] <xec> cybuch: i already told you - you want to listen to change on all the radio buttons that belong together at the top - so you do not select on value!
[05:32:16] <xec> cybuch: inside the event handler you have access to this.value which lets you know what has been activated
[05:33:14] <xec> cybuch: what you listen to and what you show/hide is two entirely different things
[05:33:43] <cybuch> w8
[05:33:51] <silverhand> I am trying to add a class to a ul that was hidden earlier on in a js file. It's not applying the class for some reason, but when I hide the same ul in the css file, it works. Is there something special I need to be doing?
[05:35:21] <cybuch> xec: It can be based as well on ID, because it's not shared. When you click one of those buttons with name="shipping_method" there should be only 1 radio button with name="payment_method" aviable
[05:36:36] <xec> cybuch: http://jsfiddle.net/kwU7G/10/
[05:37:27] <cybuch> xec: fuck me, that's exactly what I need

[05:39:09] <cybuch> xec: Going to try some, w8
[05:40:06] <jes> SO it's an .ajax() call?
[05:40:17] <Cork> $.ajax or $.post yes
[05:40:20] <thomaslfromz> I have 3 elements. If I click 2nd or 3rd the content of that element will swap with the 1st element. how would you approach such a thing?
[05:41:39] <Cork> thomaslfromz: $(parent element).on('click', 'child elements', function() { $(this).parent().prepend(this); });
[05:43:13] <thomaslfromz> thy are 3 seperate elements. or should I say LI's with image inside. no nesting

[05:50:47] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I've moved your script into mine, and whilst I get no errors in JS console it doesn't seem to work like it did in the fiddle. I've checked the attributes and classes and all seems well, just no movement on ajaxâ€¦ http://dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[05:52:44] <jeffsmykil> i gues the combobox would do what i want
[05:55:32] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: did you fix the spelling errors in the html?
[05:56:14] <Cork> ah, it is
[05:57:22] <Xotix> I'm Â trying to clean up pasted text. OnPaste, I'm focusing a different div (#cleanUp) and hen get its .text() and insert it into the origin. The problem is, if the div is out of the window, e.g. left: âˆ’1000px; it doesn't lose the formatting. http://tinyw.in/BLrgÂ scroll down click show at newsletter 313. Any hints?
[05:58:08] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: uh.. your running the selector before the table exists
[05:58:28] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you need do that after you've added the table to the page
[05:58:48] <cybuch> xec: It's not working on real page. Any idea?
[05:59:19] <xec> cybuch: include it at end of page or wrap it in a docready
[05:59:39] <cybuch> xec: I've added it to the head section - it's wrong?
[06:00:45] <xec> cybuch: http://docs.jquery.com/How_jQuery_Works#jQuery:_The_Basics
[06:02:25] <SimonSimCity> There seems to be something wrong with the jquery-bug-tracker .. I often get the error-message "MySQL server has gone away" ... I'm not quite sure if this is the right place to post it ..
[06:03:44] <xec> SimonSimCity: you could try #jquery-dev
[06:06:13] <jes> How can I invoke the $.ajax for any checkbox clicked in a form?
[06:07:00] <Cork> $(document).on('click', 'input[type="checkbox"]', function() {});
[06:07:10] <cybuch> xec: Forgot about doc.ready
[06:07:50] <jes> Cork: will this only work for the form or for all checkboxes?
[06:07:55] <cybuch> xec: Thanks again man, you made my day  ;) and my brother in law as well http://foty.tk/images/brofist.jpg
[06:08:00] <Cork> jes: all
[06:08:25] <jes> Cork: any ideas how to make it for a specific form?
[06:08:35] <Cork> jes: if you want to restrict replace document with a parent selector
[06:08:37] <xec> cybuch: oh crap you just made me punch my monitor!
[06:08:52] <jes> Cork: thanks!
[06:09:37] <cybuch> xec: ; )) I'm really gratefull
[06:09:48] <jes> So I can do <form id = "someform"> and then $("someform").on(...) ?
[06:10:23] <NoOova> hello all! what is correct way for specyfy jsonpCallbackString in ajax method as function?
[06:10:44] <rroelofs> jes: $("#someform)...
[06:10:50] <rroelofs> oops
[06:11:20] <rroelofs> $("#someform").on(...) or $("form").on(...)
[06:11:21] <jes> Can I get the value of the checkbox clicked this way?
[06:12:15] <rroelofs> yes, but you will probably want to target the checkbox directly
[06:12:32] <rroelofs> depending on exactly what you are doing
[06:13:06] <jes> I have a lot of checkboxes and when I click one I want to send ana ajax call for the clicked checkboxes value to be saved. :)
[06:14:44] <jes> how do I replace function() with $.ajax?
[06:14:56] <rroelofs> they you are right, binding to the form will probably make more sense.  your handler gets an event object and the target property has the element that was clicked
[06:15:16] <jes> How do i access it?
[06:16:06] <rroelofs> $("form").on("click" function(e) { if e.target = ... });
[06:16:36] <Christer> Hi everyone, i was wondering if you could be so kind to help me with a problem.... Is there anyway i can check to see if a <ul> has some <li> childrens and return it in a true/false statement, or something equivalent. The mission is to check if a user has moved some elements from one list to another with the drag and drop.
[06:16:48] <jes> rroelofs: thanks
[06:17:46] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I believe it's something similar to if(ul.hasChild) or something, Christer
[06:18:07] <ChrisTheSorcerer> might have to ID it thou
[06:18:08] <rroelofs> Christer: $("ul > li").length
[06:18:17] <ChrisTheSorcerer> that would work too :P
[06:18:43] <xenaxon> help. how do I execute a function at a set interval
[06:18:44] <xenaxon> ?
[06:18:46] <Christer> Great. Thanks alot. jeez, my life would have been easier if i just knew about this channel a bit sooner :p
[06:19:18] <rroelofs> xenaxon: setInterval
[06:19:20] <Cork> xenaxon: best is prob to use a setTimeout dacy chain
[06:19:36] <Cork> xenaxon: but ya, it can be done through setInterval too
[06:19:46] <xenaxon> but setInterval, I knew of it
[06:19:52] <xenaxon> but I was hoping jquery had something better
[06:20:16] <Cork> xenaxon: better?
[06:20:33] <Cork> in what way does it need to be better?
[06:20:46] <xenaxon> I need to run multiple intervals/executions
[06:20:47] <xenaxon> at different times
[06:21:05] <xenaxon> let me tell you what I'm trying to do
[06:21:07] <ChrisTheSorcerer> Then set the interval to a variable, and change the variable after what you need
[06:21:18] <ChrisTheSorcerer> setInterval(intervalVariable) :P
[06:21:25] <xenaxon> I'm trying to have changeing background image
[06:21:50] <Cork> xenaxon: you should use a ticker timer then, and check the Date element to know what to trigger
[06:22:08] <xenaxon> I'm using a relatively positioned <img> and I want to change the src, or switch the image with another
[06:22:17] <Cork> xenaxon: you should never count on setTimeout or setInterval to be accuret
[06:22:29] <xenaxon> ticker timer?
[06:23:05] <xenaxon> I don't need exact accuracy
[06:23:29] <xenaxon> but the user of the application I'm developing should have the option of changin that image
[06:23:34] <xenaxon> I mean, interval
[06:23:45] <jarr0dsz> hey guys
[06:23:48] <xenaxon> which should be something like: 5, 10 or 15 seconds
[06:23:53] <jarr0dsz> i would like to ask some expert advice on window.location and browsers
[06:23:56] <Cork> var lastTick = Date.niowsetInterval(function() { var now = Date.now(); if(now-lastTick > 10000) {}... }, 1000);
[06:24:01] <Cork> sigh
[06:24:04] <ChrisTheSorcerer> so... srcInt = setInterval(timerVariable); src = srcArray[srcInt]; ??
[06:24:06] <Cork> let me retype that
[06:24:22] <jarr0dsz> would a window.location with js be rock solid ? i get a location from websockets then with JS would like to redirect the user
[06:24:24] <jarr0dsz> to another page
[06:24:31] <xenaxon> cork, but I still need to load the function at an interval
[06:24:38] <xenaxon> I mean, set the variable*
[06:24:40] <Cork> var lastTick = Date.now(); setInterval(function() { var now = Date.now(); if(now-lastTick > 10000) {} else if()... }, 1000);
[06:24:42] <jarr0dsz> but wonder if its solid if it works in every browser, ofcourse JS has to be enabled but without my app won't run anyway
[06:25:14] <Cork> xenaxon: yes but you only need one timer for all of it
[06:25:32] <xenaxon> and there's one more thing
[06:25:45] <subdesign> hi
[06:26:02] <xenaxon> I need to make the function in a way that, it only switches through images that have loaded
[06:26:22] <xenaxon> I mean, the timer waits until 1 image is loaded, then start's flipping them at a set intervacl
[06:26:43] <Cork> then you need to have something that stors data from a onload handler for those images
[06:26:46] <subdesign> need a bit help. i want to count the width of left floated div-s in a loop, to increase their container div's size, how to do that?
[06:27:21] <xenaxon> if there's only 1 image loaded... then it doesn't switch until there are at least 2 images loaded
[06:27:29] <xenaxon> so that it has something to switch between
[06:27:36] <xenaxon> and when the rest of the ...let's say 5 images load
[06:27:40] <xenaxon> then it will switch from 5
[06:27:47] <xenaxon> because bg images are quite large
[06:28:05] <xenaxon> and I'm not counting on them being loaded all at once
[06:28:09] <Cork> xenaxon: see the comment above
[06:28:13] <xenaxon> yes, seen it
[06:28:15] <Cork> thats how you have to doit
[06:28:21] <xenaxon> thanks
[06:29:52] <subdesign> any idea?
[06:30:11] <thomaslfromz> works http://jsfiddle.net/J57L3/ But I want to replace only the IMG not the LIs. and after hiding/show the images
[06:30:22] <thomaslfromz> btw thx Cork
[06:33:17] <```poo> then why not change to "img"
[06:33:50] <jarr0dsz> im wrote a function to detect user_agent partly form stackoverflow ;p
[06:34:00] <jarr0dsz> https://gist.github.com/14af9ac9a989d2a56882 now it always returns "unknown" anyone an idea how I could fix it?
[06:34:12] <jarr0dsz> im using safari myself wich seems to be undetected the output is "Unknown"
[06:34:40] <```poo> that is not jquery nor javascript
[06:35:00] <jarr0dsz> ah sorry im in the wrong channel :S my bad excuse
[06:35:24] <jarr0dsz> i would like to ask some advise on if you can safly do a window redirect with jquery
[06:35:34] <jarr0dsz> if its rock solid in all browser or needs special function for each browser
[06:35:48] <```poo> location.href='bla.htm';
[06:36:15] <```poo> or location.replace(...)
[06:36:22] <VernonK> How about just plain ol JS?  document.location.href="url"
[06:36:52] <```poo> that's what i said..
[06:37:20] <VernonK> yep... sorry.
[06:37:43] <xenaxon> Cork: Do I have to swap the image between them, or change the src of 1 img tag?
[06:37:56] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I've rectified that now, but still the same issue
[06:39:36] <cybuch> xec: You're still here?
[06:39:49] <xec> no
[06:39:51] * xec hides
[06:39:54] <cybuch> :D
[06:40:14] <Cork> xenaxon: it should all work, it'll use cache
[06:40:46] <cybuch> xec: In our little precious code (http://jsfiddle.net/kwU7G/10/) - is it possible to hide the label as well?
[06:41:31] <```poo> you can hide anything you want to
[06:41:36] <lduros> what's the website that tells the percentage of jquery vs other libraries etc
[06:41:41] <lduros> there's a website that does stats like that
[06:41:43] <lduros> I forgot the name

[06:42:48] <xec> cybuch: you could do something like .closest("tr").hide() to hide the entire row

[06:43:02] <xenaxon> . loaded
[06:43:20] <cybuch> xec: could u give example?

[06:43:48] <timing> vectorshelve: the quotes don't seem to be utf-8
[06:43:50] <```poo> vectorshelve: i answered you
[06:44:05] <```poo> xenaxon: see ?load
[06:44:06] <bot-t> xenaxon, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[06:44:26] <vectorshelve> ```poo: so should it be document.getElementById("question_description_ifr").contentWindow.document.body
[06:44:33] <```poo> yes
[06:44:36] <```poo> either " or '
[06:44:48] <```poo> not â€™
[06:44:49] <xenaxon> ```poo: but how do you check if a specific element is loaded
[06:45:00] <```poo> xenaxon: $('#myElement').load(...)
[06:45:06] <xec> cybuch: i thought i just did
[06:45:08] <vectorshelve> ```poo: got it thanks
[06:45:27] <xenaxon> $('#myElement').load(...) returns boolean?
[06:45:34] <```poo> why not look at the docs?
[06:46:20] <xenaxon> ok
[06:46:24] <xenaxon> sry
[06:46:26] <```poo> good boy
[06:47:14] <```poo> most jquery functions return jquery objects. .load() is no different
[06:47:19] <```poo> so not a boolean
[06:47:39] <cybuch> xec: .closest("tr") will work?
[06:47:56] <```poo> hypothetically everything works
[06:48:14] <muley> so when did .load() start supporting images properly?
[06:48:18] <xec> cybuch: well, obviously you would need a selection to perform the action on
[06:48:40] <```poo> .load supports whatever the browser's load event supports
[06:48:47] <cybuch> xec: ye, going to work with that
[06:48:52] <xec> cybuch: so $("#ID").closest("tr") will select the (closest) table row that contains the id
[06:49:15] <muley> i have some old plugin from a couple of years ago to handle image loading... i guess diff browsers do different things on image load
[06:49:45] <```poo> diff browsers do different things.
[06:49:55] <muley> ya
[06:50:05] <PavelloZ> xec: going up in DOM< afair;)
[06:50:11] <muley> still need the plugin then =[

[06:53:05] <PavelloZ> Doxin: https://github.com/tombonner/jurlp
[06:53:07] <xec> the selector? "input"
[06:53:14] <PavelloZ> or just split it :)

[06:54:14] <```poo> Doxin: window.location.href

[06:55:32] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: I have moved query after the table but still no luck: dev4.printpartnerships.com/flyer-printing
[06:55:51] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: sorry for the delay, got buzy
[06:56:02] <Xotix> Is it possible that i can't focus() and element which is empty? Emptied with .empty()?
[06:56:08] <djQuery> morning
[06:56:47] <PavelloZ> Xotix, on iOS? :)
[06:56:47] <djQuery> u should be able to as long as it is a focusable element
[06:57:13] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: uh... you just moved it into its own script tag
[06:57:18] <Cork> that won't change anything
[06:57:21] <Xotix> PavelloZ:  yes,
[06:57:26] <fRAiLtY-> Ohâ€¦ it's after the table though ?
[06:57:33] <thomaslfromz> cant wrap my brain around it http://jsfiddle.net/J57L3/1/ second js does not work. where is my conceptional()) error?
[06:57:35] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: you need to use the success callback from the ajax call
[06:57:42] <qvarkk> how can i set all text fields background-color as same as the .val() ?
[06:57:44] <Cork> after you append the new html to the dom
[06:57:56] <PavelloZ> Xotix: good luck, I hope you resolve this one and tell me the solution... I spent about 2 days on that one and finally gave up
[06:57:59] <fRAiLtY-> But there's a table loaded on page load that's not working also ?
[06:58:32] <Xotix> PavelloZ  what exactly is you goal?
[06:59:00] <PavelloZ> manipulate some focuses, on focus execute some functions, normal stuff
[06:59:31] <PavelloZ> and the "previous" and "next" iOS helpers are not perfect
[06:59:45] <Xotix> I'm having a div with position: absolute; left: âˆ’10000px; onPaste I'm focus() ing it. After that i empty it. If there is some content, it works, if not it isn't selectable anymore. -.-
[06:59:49] <Xotix> *focusable
[07:00:32] <itatitat> ey guys
[07:00:33] <itatitat> ey
[07:00:36] <PavelloZ> you are focusing div? ;) woah, i haad problem with inputs
[07:00:39] <itatitat> im using the event keypress
[07:00:47] <itatitat> to detect change in an input
[07:01:01] <itatitat> simple, but......keypress detect always a letter minus
[07:01:04] <itatitat> what happend?
[07:01:08] <subdesign> hm, i want an .each on several divs, but i need to use .live for it, because the divs arent there
[07:01:10] <subdesign> ?
[07:01:25] <Xotix> subdesign use on and yes
[07:02:11] <ChrisTheSorcerer> I don't mean to brag (especially since you guys helped me with this), but my project was just live tested and works flawlessly :D
[07:02:17] <subdesign> Xotix, trying
[07:02:21] <Xotix> subdesign if the divs are there and you get them by class name you don't need on though. I you want to attach an event for elements which are comign or changing use on
[07:02:40] <subdesign> okay
[07:03:16] <subdesign> what if there isnt a specific event like "click" only a jquery script runs?
[07:04:39] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: table referes to a table that isn't in the page anymore
[07:04:56] <Cork> fRAiLtY-: should prob move the setter into the event handler
[07:05:02] <Xotix> subdesign, and the script does what?
[07:05:52] <subdesign> I put a product into the cart, jquery droppable, and i want to count the product div's width, and then increase their container's width.
[07:06:22] <subdesign> ok paste:
[07:07:01] <subdesign> Xotix, http://hastebin.com/suwubocija.coffee
[07:07:24] <Xotix> subdesign: on paste you can get the dragged item. something like function(ui) {ui.draggable} iirc
[07:08:22] <subdesign> ok but I need all the items, and sum their width.
[07:09:06] <subdesign> then increase the container div (theres a scroller so products overflow)
[07:10:35] <rezas> In the following examples >> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/ What does function() mean?
[07:10:44] <Xotix> subdesign doesn't sound that complicated. get the width of the shopping cart and add the width of the draggable. If you are using sortable within the cart it should increase automatically. like http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/#sortable
[07:11:01] <subdesign> no i don't
[07:11:39] <Xotix> rezas anonymous functionsâ€¦ you should read about js.
[07:11:41] <subdesign> Xotix, yes but my problem is that only pressing F5 count's the width and goes well
[07:11:45] <minna> How can i replace the current body with the body from ajax response? I googled but found nothing on this.
[07:11:56] <subdesign> its an ajax cart , i dont want refresh.
[07:12:13] <rezas> Xotix: ok. will do. Thanks
[07:13:02] <subdesign> but I see so sortable auto count the width of container div
[07:13:47] <Xotix> subdesign make you a script which updates the width of the cart (don't you mean height?) and call it on each drop
[07:14:30] <subdesign> i put the script in the beginning of the script but doesn't run on dropping..
[07:15:20] <subdesign> as you see in my paste at the end there is the snippet
[07:15:57] <subdesign> and what isnt in the paste the snippet is at the beginning of js file
[07:16:56] <Xotix> subdesign it needs to be called each time the width cahnges. each tme you receive a droppable.
[07:17:17] <subdesign> yes i do it
[07:17:39] <Robbington> Hi, Might be a bit of a thicky question, but not sure how to access the data in a jason object returned from a ajax request.
[07:18:05] <Robbington> request.done(function(data) {
[07:18:30] <Xotix> subdesign ah i miss read me...
[07:18:40] <Robbington> So console.log show the right data is returned, but data.islogged just returns undefined.
[07:19:02] <Robbington> when islogged is a propety of data
[07:20:09] <warrenparsons> Robbington: Are you using $.getJSON?
[07:21:14] <minna> Is it not possible to replace response body with current body?
[07:22:16] <Xotix> sudesign the logic should be correct, you don't get an error? width + 100 + 'px' does that work?(width + 100) + 'px' maybe.I've done somethign similar like child.css('padding-bottom', (tbodyChildren.eq(index).height() - 16));
[07:23:06] <Robbington> warrenparsons, no here is a pastebin of what I am doing
[07:23:07] <Robbington> http://pastebin.com/RYUFzLK7
[07:24:05] <hlveheart> anybody know why this isn't actually doing what it's supposed to?
[07:24:06] <hlveheart> http://pastebin.com/dMeBs2XT
[07:24:17] <Xotix> subdesign: or that .css( "padding-left", "+=15" )
[07:24:52] <minna> Anyone?
[07:25:11] <subdesign> Xotix, console shows that my product width =500. i have two prods in the cart (should be 1000 then) .....
[07:25:18] <Xotix> $('body').html(xxx) maybe? (just guessing)
[07:26:03] <warrenparsons> Robbington: If line 23 is your actual JSON data, it's not valid. Key names have to be double-quoted.
[07:26:26] <subdesign> Xotix, trying livequery or live maybe
[07:26:54] <Xotix> subdesign, try setting you cart di to display: inline-block; this makes it dynamic. You know all divs, shouldn't need live (live is deprecated use on)
[07:26:56] <Robbington> warrenparsons: do you mean key values? There are bools
[07:27:14] <warrenparsons> Robbington: No, the names. Unquoted booleans are fine for obvious reasons.
[07:27:38] <warrenparsons> Robbington: In the JSON, IsActiveEmail should be double quoted.
[07:27:51] <subdesign> ok
[07:27:55] <hlveheart> anybody?
[07:27:56] <hlveheart> o.o
[07:28:07] <Robbington> Ok, here is snip of the php array I encode to jSon
[07:28:08] <Robbington> $response['IsInactiveUser'] = false;
[07:28:23] <Xotix> subdesign basically it should be enough to just get the width of the incoming item, add it and you'r done. hmm
[07:28:33] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: http://pastie.org/3721030 here's my instances. The echo Mage::getModel is where it instantiates the table on page load. That div is then refreshed on AJAX.
[07:29:25] <warrenparsons> Robbington: Actually JSON needs to be written as an object. "IsActiveEmail": true, "IsActiveUsername": true, etc.
[07:29:33] <subdesign> Xotix, after the each loot width = 500 (so width of 1 product)
[07:30:47] <Christer> i got this sortable list item with the drag and drop functionality, how could i send all the elements in one list trough the $.ajax POST method? (preferably as an array if possible)
[07:30:57] <Xotix> subdesign you proably just set it to 500 and not adding it .css( "padding-left", "+=15" )
[07:30:57] <silverhand> How can I reveal a hidden li and have it move to the top?
[07:31:53] <hlveheart> anybody know why this isn't actually doing what it's supposed to?  .. http://pastebin.com/dMeBs2XT
[07:32:30] <Robbington> hmm, not sure what I am doing wrong then, using json_encode() should return them with double quotes
[07:34:28] <hlveheart> Heeeeeeeeeeeerrooooooo?
[07:34:29] <hlveheart> o.o
[07:35:31] <Xotix> why is a div, which is out of my window (left: âˆ’10000px;) and empty html('') not focusable?
[07:35:45] <quicksilver> divs aren't focussable anyway.
[07:35:52] <quicksilver> only input elements are focusable.
[07:35:56] <Xotix> contenteditable div
[07:36:08] <_ikke_> meh, api.jquery.com is down
[07:36:13] <quicksilver> no idea. contenteditable is a closed book to me :)
[07:36:47] <Xotix> quicksilver ok, i'm using it to clean up text. redirect the paste there and do .text() i also could use a textarea, right?
[07:37:00] <hlveheart> alright, so maybe if i go nakeds people will actually reply to me
[07:37:06] <```poo> _ikke_ whacha lookin for
[07:37:14] <ctk> is there a mirror of the jquery docs?
[07:37:16] <TandyUK> anyone got a link to a copy of the api docs? api.jquery.com is timing out for me atm
[07:37:20] <ctk> haha
[07:37:24] <_ikke_> $.get()
[07:37:28] <TandyUK> ah it just came back
[07:37:33] <```poo> ?get
[07:37:33] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[07:37:34] <Christer> hlveheart: Taking a wild show as im new to jQuery aswell - but $("#AddSub input[type='radio']']:checked") should probably be: $("#AddSub input[type='radio']']").attr(":checked")
[07:37:41] <Xotix> hlveheart: irc doesn't support cams :(
[07:38:04] <ctk> api docs still down for me
[07:38:06] <_ikke_> hmm, I mean the ajax get..
[07:38:08] <quicksilver> hlveheart: well, type='radio']'] looks very odd
[07:38:12] <```poo> ?$.get
[07:38:14] <bot-t> ```poo, jQuery.get() - Load data from the server using a HTTP GET request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.get/
[07:38:15] <quicksilver> hlveheart: why two ] and two '?
[07:38:32] <subdesign> Xotix, as i see draggable and sortable as you said increase the width automatically so ill do that method.. thx
[07:38:34] <TandyUK> ok maybe that was a blip lol its timing out again now
[07:38:49] <Christer> probably a editor "bug" for auto closing.
[07:38:58] <Robbington> warrenparson: Json obj properties dont need to be double quoted, I was being a spoon and json_encode(array($respons)) when $repsonse was already and array
[07:39:03] <hlveheart> quicksilver, which line?
[07:39:13] <Christer> hlveheart: everyline
[07:39:16] <TandyUK> can someone give me a very simple demo how to add a div to an existing page
[07:39:18] <hlveheart> errr
[07:39:22] <Xotix> subdesign, each should work as well as long as you add the width and not just reset it. anyway np
[07:39:32] <hlveheart> oh hey you're right
[07:39:33] <hlveheart> o_O
[07:39:35] <danzik17> hlveheart: in addition the the addition ] and stuff, you're checking if a jQuery object is truthy in your if statements.  it's always going to evaluate truthy - you need to be checking the .length property of that object.
[07:39:49] <TandyUK> i want my div to be added, and render top right, with a textara and a button in it, which i can assign a click() handler to
[07:40:01] <subdesign> Xotix, i did width =  width + $(this).width();  in each loop..
[07:40:11] <TandyUK> or a link to some working example site would dbe cool
[07:40:14] <hlveheart> so what would be the best way to do this, then?
[07:40:21] <```poo> TandyUK: $('body').append($('<div />'))
[07:40:28] <quicksilver> hlveheart: in fact I think you mean .is(':checked')
[07:40:57] <Xotix> subdesign i know, i just mean. anyway good luck :) you can also disable sortable iirc
[07:41:01] <Christer> i got this sortable list item with the drag and drop functionality, how could i send all the elements in one list trough the $.ajax POST method? (preferably as an array if possible)
[07:41:02] <quicksilver> if ($('foo:checked')) is a bit different from if ($('foo').is(':checked')
[07:41:52] <hlveheart> Is it?
[07:42:12] <TandyUK> ```poo, and if i want to insert content to that div, how can i give the inserted div an id?
[07:42:15] <fRAiLtY-> Cork: http://pastie.org/3721030 here's my instances. The echo Mage::getModel is where it instantiates the table on page load. That div is then refreshed on AJAX.
[07:42:16] <quicksilver> yes, it is.
[07:42:26] <TandyUK>  $('body').append($('<div id="something" />'))   ?
[07:42:32] <```poo> TandyUK: $('<div id="bla" />')
[07:42:34] <quicksilver> as danzik17 said, jQuery objects are always true.
[07:42:37] <danzik17> hlveheart: yes.  one returns a jquery set, one returns a bool.  you also don't need to be re-running your selectors in your handlers.  this is already the radio input in your case
[07:42:41] <TandyUK> cool im starting to like jquery :)
[07:42:41] <quicksilver> all javascript objects are always true.
[07:42:45] <_ikke_> yay, it's up again
[07:42:49] <```poo> ;)
[07:42:53] <danzik17> so in fact, your handler could just be $('#Addes').toggle( this.checked )
[07:43:06] <TandyUK> doe the append support raw html too?
[07:43:16] <TandyUK>  $('body').append($('<div id="something">With somethign in</div>'))   ?
[07:43:20] <```poo> think so
[07:43:24] <```poo> best to try..
[07:43:30] <hlveheart> because I'm so utterly confused atm with this
[07:44:02] <danzik17> hlveheart: "this" the object/context, or "this" what you're trying to do?  =P
[07:44:39] <hlveheart> well, taking what i just learned from you lovely people, and applying it to my code. That's where the confusion sets in
[07:44:55] <```poo> step by step usually works
[07:45:01] <```poo> figure out the first one.
[07:45:21] <danzik17> hlveheart: take your code and paste it into jsfiddle.net .  it's FAR easier for people here to help you there since we can modify and re-link your code.
[07:45:24] <```poo> by the time you formulate it you'll prolly know how to code it
[07:45:55] <hlveheart> ^^ one sec.
[07:45:56] <hlveheart> :)
[07:50:43] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/f9CA3/2/
[07:52:09] <djQuery> $('.cs.MID').find('input').remove().append($('<input>', {type: 'number'}));
[07:52:29] <sphinxxx> how can i loop through an array that doesn't use number indexs?
[07:52:36] <sphinxxx> for example, instead of arr[0], arr[1] , etc.
[07:52:42] <djQuery> can append not append 2 inputs at once? the remove part works fine but not the input part    $('.cs.MID').find('input').remove().append($('<input>', {type: 'number'}));
[07:52:43] <sphinxxx> it's arr['this']  and arr['that']
[07:54:12] <djQuery> my selector return 2 divs
[07:54:56] <djQuery> got it needed to throw and end in there
[07:55:01] <andrew9183> please fiddle it :)
[07:55:31] <djQuery> $('.cs.MID').find('input').remove().end().append('<input>');
[07:56:03] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/f9CA3/2/  btw. I'll be right back. I have a employee review.
[07:56:10] <quicksilver> sphinxxx: there is for/in but, probably, don't use it.
[07:56:12] <quicksilver> sphinxxx: http://yuiblog.com/blog/2006/09/26/for-in-intrigue/
[07:57:24] <xec> sphinxxx: javascript arrays do not have named keys, most likely you're talking about an object
[07:57:34] <sphinxxx> xec: yeah its an object
[07:58:07] <xec> sphinxxx: the easy way is $.each(obj, function(key, val){ ... })
[07:58:31] <hlveheart> anybody?
[07:59:08] <sphinxxx> xec , i did this:
[07:59:10] <sphinxxx> 	for (var i in arrr) {
[07:59:11] <sphinxxx> 	   if (arrr[i] == 0) {arrr[i]=.01;}
[07:59:12] <sphinxxx> 	}
[07:59:17] <andrew9183> hlveheart: why two right square brackets
[07:59:21] <andrew9183> if ($("#NewHosting input[type='radio']']
[07:59:27] <sphinxxx> arrr is my object, and i want to change any value thats 0 to .01 in the object
[08:00:27] <Aamir> hlveheart: you should use  if(this.checked)                if ($("#NewHosting input[type='radio']']:checked"))
[08:00:55] <andrew9183> ahh
[08:01:31] <xec> sphinxxx: ok. so, did it work?
[08:02:05] <djQuery> hlveheart, why do you want to do a function for each checkbox,
[08:02:49] <xec> because he's following the "write more, do less" mantra
[08:03:28] <xec> i'm a big fan myself. http://web.tradekorea.com/upload_file/prod/marketing/mkt_files/new_company//mirtech/img_en/o_P288459.jpg
[08:03:45] <andrew9183> lol xec
[08:05:55] <djQuery> Aamir, he can't use this.checked because he is attaching to both of the radios by thier name instead of to one based on its id
[08:08:31] <XOXO1> hello. I am using jquery draggable and somehow my CPU usage goes to ~30% while dragging a simple picture
[08:08:51] <djQuery> XOXO1, what browser?
[08:08:58] <XOXO1> chromium
[08:09:08] <thomaslfromz> how to target closest+1
[08:09:12] <djQuery> ?demo@xoxo1
[08:09:13] <bot-t> xoxo1, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[08:09:38] <djQuery> XOXO1, are you doing something on drag start?
[08:10:14] <xec> thomaslfromz: what does + 1 mean
[08:10:29] <XOXO1> djQuery: yes. though I now restarted my browser and CPU usage also dropped. but after a while it goes up again
[08:10:44] <thomaslfromz> xec the next one to closest
[08:11:02] <xec> as in sibling?
[08:11:04] <xec> ?next @ thomaslfromz
[08:11:04] <bot-t> thomaslfromz, .next([selector]): Get the immediately following sibling of each element in the set of matched elements. If a selector is provided, it retrieves the next sibling only if it matches that selector. http://api.jquery.com/next/
[08:11:06] <djQuery> XOXO1, can you reproduce it with the demo on jquery ui? and what version of jquery and ui are u using
[08:11:41] <subdesign> Xotix, my fault, i had to put the widener snippen in the $.get callback, so after loading the cart view, the snippet works.
[08:12:07] * thomaslfromz is reading http://api.jquery.com/next-adjacent-Selector/
[08:12:07] <Xotix> subdesign didn't you have had it in the callback?
[08:12:30] <subdesign> Xotix, no it was "after" the view loader :/
[08:12:33] <XOXO1> jquery 1.7.1 and ui is 1.8.12
[08:12:35] <xec> thomaslfromz: i think bot-t is on to something!
[08:12:39] <xec> ?botsnack
[08:12:39] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[08:12:56] <Xotix> hmm ok good then. I'm gone, bye
[08:12:58] <subdesign> Xotix, so thanks the lot of help
[08:13:04] <thomaslfromz> oh bot
[08:13:04] <subdesign> bye
[08:13:04] <XOXO1> djQuery: I'll play with my browser a bit and let's see if the CPU usage goes up again
[08:13:08] <thomaslfromz> botsnack
[08:13:10] <Xotix> np
[08:13:17] <thomaslfromz> ?botsnack
[08:13:18] <bot-t> Thank you! OMNOMNOMNOMNOM
[08:13:23] <thomaslfromz> ?botsmack
[08:13:25] <bot-t> thomaslfromz, Couldn't find "botsmack" in jQuery Docs.
[08:14:02] <djQuery> XOXO1, I am seeing it using the demo but it probably has to do with all the redrws that the browser has to do while draging
[08:14:09] <xec> thomaslfromz: stop spamming the channel and read the link bot-t gave you :P
[08:15:35] <hlveheart> did anybody help me while I was in my meeting?
[08:15:43] <hlveheart> I didn't see any ping pings
[08:15:53] <djQuery> hlveheart, search upwards for your name
[08:16:50] <subdesign> did I say I love this channel ? :P
[08:17:42] <hlveheart> my irc has a low buffer, and /clears after 25 lines
[08:17:48] <hlveheart> work computer blows
[08:20:05] <djQuery> hlveheart, do you know about see ?toggle
[08:20:06] <bot-t> hlveheart, .toggle(handler, handler, [handler]): Bind two or more handlers to the matched elements, to be executed on alternate clicks. http://api.jquery.com/toggle/
[08:20:55] <fRAiLtY-> Why is my select .find() part not working, http://pastie.org/3721030 here's my instances. The echo Mage::getModel is where it instantiates the table on page load. That div is then refreshed on AJAX.
[08:20:57] <djQuery> hlveheart, and you have an extra ] in your selectors
[08:21:00] <fRAiLtY-> The ajax part works
[08:21:41] <hlveheart> i already removed those and it didn't help
[08:21:42] <hlveheart> lol
[08:22:32] <djQuery> hlveheart, so you have 3 radios and want to show 1 of 3 divs based on which radio is selected right?
[08:23:05] <hlveheart> i copied over an example, my actual code is in ASP so I couldn't fiddle it
[08:23:17] <djQuery> hlveheart, I have it up
[08:23:27] <hlveheart> no no I know
[08:23:45] <hlveheart> Basically, it's a form that has conditional fields that need to show depending on if a radio is selected
[08:23:52] <djQuery> fingered it was .net from the ids
[08:23:57] <hlveheart> heh
[08:24:13] <hlveheart> just makes it hard to show it in fiddle, so i made up a example radio
[08:28:13] <fRAiLtY-> Here's the working fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/exzpb/42/

[08:34:16] <inavran> hi
[08:34:46] <inavran> the site im doing for a friend has jquery in it. works fine in chrome/ff but not in IE

[08:37:15] <justinhjohnson> inavran, you'll have to be a lot more specific
[08:40:02] <mszola> I need help with a ui effect.
[08:40:37] <mszola> I have a picture that is bigger than the parent div that I want to scale down so it's the same size as the parent div.
[08:40:43] <mszola> The problem is that it has to be centered.
[08:41:09] <mszola> if I center the picture, then after it scales it's messed up because it's positioned and it goes to the original position which is outside of the div.
[08:41:15] <mszola> how do I get it to also scale the position?
[08:44:11] <slon__> Does jquery 1.7.2 compile using google closure compiler?
[08:44:43] <slon__> Or, does anyone know how to do animations in google closure?
[08:44:49] <slon__> *library
[08:45:10] <slon__> I want to animate a css property and I'm not having any luck finding any documentation on how to do this
[08:45:18] <lduros> by default $('body').text() also extract the contents of <script> tags etc
[08:45:25] <lduros> I'd like to only get the user readable text'
[08:45:32] <lduros> is there a way to do this? :-)
[08:45:50] <djQuery> mszola, why not set the height and width of the pic to 100%
[08:48:35] <jita> I have a division which changes its position on every different browser, http://jsfiddle.net/zSmjt/
[08:48:43] <jita> the id is login
[08:49:15] <monk12> hey all, i was going to do a check in my app so if its dev, then include jquery.js, else(qa/prod) include jquery.min.js ... just curious do you prefer QA to have minimized js code that will be on prod? or full code you can find errors in?
[08:49:51] <jita> clicking on test bring the drop down menu
[08:50:00] <jita> but the menu's position is different in eery different browser
[08:50:05] <bakers> is window.open still the best way to open a URL in a new tab?
[08:50:19] <thomaslfromz> to shif elements in a js array to the left in a loop without loosing first element but put that element to last index, I need to shift() AND push()?

[09:05:17] <devkinetic> I know this is idiotic, but can some offer some assistance with animating my slider?
[09:05:31] <devkinetic> i just need some pointers
[09:09:04] <hlveheart> don't ask to ask, devkinetic
[09:09:10] <hlveheart> read the topic.

[09:12:05] <inavran> im trying to get the file name i am on.
[09:12:07] <binaryfus10nz> if I wanted to do my own little cycle, perhaps a loop with setTimeout - are there any recommendations?
[09:12:08] <inavran> ie doesn't like http://pastebin.com/8JNV02UN
[09:12:11] <devkinetic> I have a slider filled with divs floated left. i need help animating them. According to my code, without animation, i click next, a div is prepended and :last-child div is removed.
[09:12:29] <devkinetic> vice versa for prev.
[09:12:50] <binaryfus10nz> inavran, have you tried var tesTer = window.location
[09:12:56] <inavran> no.
[09:13:02] <binaryfus10nz> try window.location maybe
[09:13:04] <inavran> thanks i'll try it.
[09:13:16] <inavran> just striaght off..

[09:14:47] <binaryfus10nz> window.location.pathname
[09:14:50] <inavran> i need an alternative to lastIndexOf
[09:14:52] <inavran> which works in IE
[09:15:00] <binaryfus10nz> maybe add pathanem
[09:15:06] <inavran> k 2sec
[09:15:35] <binaryfus10nz> hmm you have URI should it maybe be URL
[09:15:38] <inavran> thats better
[09:15:45] <inavran> but im getting the leading slash

[09:22:07] <bakers> to detect when ANY data on the form changes?
[09:22:09] <xenaxon> ?
[09:23:09] <quicksilver> bakers: no, but you can do $("form input").change() to attach the handler to all inputs in the form
[09:23:25] <quicksilver> and :input to attach it to even pseudo-inputs, like selets and textareas.

[09:26:44] <xenaxon> ?
[09:26:46] <xenaxon> what does it do
[09:26:49] <djQuery> would type of an input be attr or prop?
[09:26:51] <NoiseEee> xenaxon: its basic javascript
[09:26:59] <NoiseEee> xenaxon: it tells you the length of an array.
[09:27:03] <xenaxon> ok
[09:27:06] <hlveheart> lenswipe, ask your question, don't ask if you can ask.
[09:27:09] <hlveheart> read the friggen topic.
[09:27:17] <djQuery> ?ask@lenswipe
[09:27:17] <bot-t> lenswipe, If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:27:22] <lenswipe> hlveheart, i read the friggen topic and i asked my friggen question
[09:27:54] <hlveheart> woah language
[09:28:04] <lenswipe> <hlveheart> read the friggen topic.
[09:28:06] <djQuery> lenswipe, well I was away and scrolling up I dont see it. ask again?
[09:28:15] <quicksilver> hlveheart: don't be an ass.
[09:28:30] <hlveheart> ...i was being facetious
[09:28:43] <quicksilver> djQuery: <input type="text"> # it's in the HTML so it's an attr, djQuery
[09:28:59] <lenswipe> ok well i have a collection of text boxes and i want to find one with a specific value and count them so to speak
[09:29:07] <djQuery> quicksilver, thanks
[09:29:11] <lenswipe> so i want to find the number of text boxes with value "foo"
[09:29:22] <lenswipe> i already have code to do that but it seems to have stopped working, lemme get a pastebin up
[09:29:28] <quicksilver> lenswipe: $('input[value="foo"]').length
[09:29:33] <djQuery> $('input[value="foo"]).length
[09:29:38] <lenswipe> yeah i have that
[09:29:49] <devkinetic> I have a slider filled with divs floated left. i need help animating them. According to my code, without animation, i click next, a div is prepended and :last-child div is removed. can anyone offer some assistance with this..
[09:29:56] <bakers> quicksilver:  $("form").change() seems to work in FF, Chrome, and IE8

[09:30:44] <TandyUK> anyone know any Alternatives to GM_setValue/GM_getValue that work both in chrome, and from jquery?
[09:31:04] <TandyUK> i want to store a text string, and reload it next page load from  user script
[09:31:45] <TandyUK> the script interacts with jquer, but from within my click() handler, i cannot access GM_setValue (in firefox), and the function doesnt work at all in chrome
[09:32:38] <djQuery> lenswipe, http://jsbin.com/ahemih/edit#javascript,html,live
[09:32:42] <djQuery> works for me
[09:33:11] <quicksilver> bakers: oh, well, learn something every day :)
[09:33:26] <bakers> quicksilver: I didn't think it would work either
[09:34:13] <quicksilver> bakers: just event propagation I guess.
[09:34:23] <quicksilver> bakers: not sure why I didn't think event propagation applied to 'change' events.
[09:34:29] <quicksilver> not enough coffee perhaps.

[09:36:32] <djQuery> sure
[09:36:39] <devkinetic> how can i make remove() wait until animate() finishes?
[09:37:00] <WesleyL> use the callback in animate

[09:42:33] <xenaxon> I just can't figure out what's wrong with my code
[09:42:42] <NoiseEee> tomasm-: look into detach()
[09:42:48] <ryanneufeld> can anyone recommend handlebars vs moustache?
[09:43:18] <egrouse> $target = $( 'div#info' ); $target.children.clone().appendTo( $target.parent() ); $target.remove(); tomasm-
[09:43:22] <egrouse> i dont know if that will actually work
[09:43:30] <ryanneufeld> ?console @ xenaxon
[09:43:31] <bot-t> xenaxon, Firebug and the Command Line - http://getfirebug.com/commandline
[09:43:56] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: if you look at your javascript console you'll see that you have an error
[09:44:04] <tomasm-> egrouse, the only problem is if the target is in the middle of the parent, and not the end, the children will be moved to the end of the parent and not the midpoint.... I think I have to use after()
[09:44:15] <egrouse> ah yeah
[09:44:33] <egrouse> you could add it after $target and then remove $target i guess
[09:44:46] <lenswipe> djQuery, any ideas?
[09:44:58] <djQuery> lenswipe, workin
[09:45:02] <lenswipe> kk
[09:45:32] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/1/
[09:45:43] <xenaxon> I've modified but something's still wrong
[09:46:23] <jahrichie> djQuery: I figured out how to add the class to that carousel, but it adds to all of them, not the current slide
[09:46:26] <jahrichie> lol
[09:46:28] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: what does your console say?
[09:46:41] <tomasm-> egrouse, $target.children, or $target.children() ?
[09:46:42] <catcher> How can I test if an object is empty before jquery 1.4?
[09:46:47] <djQuery> jahrichie, probably need to remove them then add
[09:46:53] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/2/
[09:46:57] <xenaxon> console says nothing
[09:47:22] <jahrichie> djQuery: put a remove before and after and got nothing. I thnk it need some further context I don't understand
[09:47:29] <mszola> catcher: $(your element).length should do it
[09:47:51] <catcher> mszola, gave that a go, but didn't work out.. I think I'd have to convert to array for that.
[09:47:55] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/2/
[09:47:55] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: mine says something
[09:48:09] <xenaxon> what does it say
[09:48:13] <mszola> hmm... that's strange
[09:48:24] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: Open yours and find out.
[09:48:41] <xenaxon> I opened, and it says nothing
[09:48:43] <xenaxon> it's white line
[09:48:55] <mszola> can you set the object with a value of '' and then test whether it has '' or a value?
[09:48:55] <egrouse> i think it would be with () tomasm-
[09:48:58] <egrouse> not sure tho
[09:49:02] <egrouse> check docs :)
[09:49:13] <tomasm-> thx
[09:49:19] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: what browser are you using? Try it in chrome.
[09:49:38] <catcher> mszola, yeah, that's probably the best idea, or just pass the error string from my json publisher.
[09:50:03] <catcher> mszola, ty
[09:50:11] <jahrichie> what;s the best site to contract some js work?
[09:50:15] <xenaxon> ok
[09:50:19] <xenaxon> it says unexpected token
[09:50:26] <xenaxon> but I've fixed this issue and still nothing
[09:50:30] <xenaxon> maybe I'm missing something
[09:50:38] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: yes, the errors in the console
[09:50:56] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: it's telling there is something wrong
[09:51:34] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/8/
[09:53:14] <xenaxon> I've fixed it, and still nothing http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/9/
[09:53:35] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: really? i'm still seeing an error in the console
[09:53:37] <PacaPaca> you still have syntax errors... firebug or chrome is your friend.
[09:54:35] <mszola> if you like firebug best, you can now install firebug light to chrome :)
[09:54:56] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: check your { } looks like you're missing one
[09:55:32] <djQuery> lenswipe, http://jsbin.com/uqifol/edit#javascript,html,live
[09:55:36] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/9/
[09:55:49] <xenaxon> now It's working but it's not switching all the images, just some
[09:55:56] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: that's the same one you already linked, and I just told you it's not working
[09:56:38] <xenaxon> no, it's modified
[09:56:59] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: scroll up
[09:57:02] <ryanneufeld> you sent me the same link
[09:57:04] <ryanneufeld> :p
[09:57:17] <ryanneufeld> you need to click update to get a new url to share the code
[09:57:56] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/12/
[09:58:08] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/13/
[09:58:33] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: why are you using date?
[09:58:44] <jahrichie> djQuery: this adds a class to the image but doesn't  remove it when the slide changes, weird.  http://pastebin.com/b9hSs2DY   
[09:58:45] <xenaxon> cause someone here recommended it earlier
[09:58:50] <ryanneufeld> also, set interval is ill advized
[09:59:57] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/12/
[10:00:13] <xenaxon> I don't understand why it's not switching through all 4 images
[10:00:16] <xenaxon> it's only doing 2/3
[10:00:43] <ryanneufeld> I don't understand why you've written a for loop inside an interval that also uses date.now()
[10:00:55] <PacaPaca> xenaxon what are you trying to accomplish? just cycle between all the images in 1s intervals? you have some weird logi going on
[10:01:02] <ryanneufeld> you have so many factors that could contribute to this problem
[10:01:17] <TandyUK> anyone know how i can test for the existance of an element like this...  <a class="confirm_box_friend_text" href="/username">Friend request waiting for approval</a>
[10:01:22] <PacaPaca> http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/15/ much simpler
[10:01:29] <xenaxon> I'm trying to cycle only through loaded images
[10:01:38] <xenaxon> once every few seconds
[10:01:44] <itatitat> ey guys
[10:01:44] <xenaxon> let's say 5 or 10 seconds
[10:01:48] <itatitat> im working with this code
[10:01:49] <TandyUK> the css class is static, and i would know the "username" part
[10:01:53] <itatitat> im making an autocomplete
[10:02:10] <djQuery> jahrichie, move the code for the slide to its own .js file give me the name of the .js file and a link to the page again
[10:02:20] <itatitat> but.......when i make click in one option, I cant to replace the value of the input text for the value selected
[10:02:24] <itatitat> what happen?
[10:02:30] <xenaxon> PacaPaca: the script needs to check if the images are loaded first
[10:02:38] <djQuery> jahrichie, remember that the page was kinda cluster-f'd so dont want to have to search for it
[10:02:55] <xenaxon> PacaPaca: if there is only 1 image loaded, it will not switch the image, because there is nothing to switch to
[10:03:20] <xenaxon> PacaPaca: if the second image has loaded, then it will switch through the first and second
[10:03:30] <xenaxon> PacaPaca: and so on, untill all bg images are loaded
[10:03:40] <xenaxon> PacaPaca: in which case it switch through all
[10:04:14] <xenaxon> PacaPaca: it also needs to switch through them only once every 5 or 10 seconds or whatever the user wants it to
[10:04:40] <xenaxon> so, you simplified the script to something from which I started off
[10:05:34] <PacaPaca> o haha ok I wasnt sure what you were trying to do... i'll take a look at it in a cpl mins
[10:05:45] <xenaxon> because the script is used to switch page background images
[10:05:50] <xenaxon> and bg images are big
[10:05:53] <xenaxon> they might be 1MB
[10:06:00] <xenaxon> so, I can't have them all loaded
[10:06:08] <xenaxon> ok, thanks
[10:06:30] <xenaxon> I'd appreciate it, I'm not sure why it's not switch through all images in version 12
[10:06:49] <xenaxon> http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/12/
[10:06:53] <jahrichie> djQuery:  thanks again, uploading now
[10:06:56] <ryanneufeld> xenaxon: http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/16/
[10:08:06] <itatitat> why this not work?
[10:08:11] <itatitat> jQuery('#panelAutocomplete ul li').click(function(){
[10:08:19] <itatitat> never detect the click...
[10:08:55] <lenswipe> djQuery, thats it, thanks! :)
[10:10:07] <jahrichie> djQuery: file is called  directors-settings.js -- again originally from http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/stepcarousel.htm
[10:10:27] <itatitat> why doesnt detect the event click
[10:10:33] <itatitat> jquery over a list
[10:10:35] <itatitat> <?
[10:17:25] <PacaPaca> http://jsfiddle.net/mjGzw/28/ adds images to the loadedBgs array when the load event is fired and cycles through them... I think that's what you're after.
[10:17:33] <PacaPaca> xenaxon^
[10:18:05] <PacaPaca> and i'm off to lunch so hopefully that does it :)
[10:18:20] <majd> Hey #jquery - i have a container with a border and a bunch of <div class="post"> in it. I use .fadeOut() to hide some of the divs, and the container resizes, as it should. But when i do .fadeIn() again, the container doesn't resize

[10:20:37] <alexbodn> hello friends
[10:20:38] <alexbodn> i'm serializing a form, in order to send it as data to ajax. when sending (type='POST'), the data serialized string is getting sent as a split string, not as the correctly serialized name=value pairs. any idea?
[10:21:08] <t4nkd> brb
[10:21:40] <mbtez_> i'm using a script that's trying to receive two css attributes for an element
[10:21:48] <mbtez_> width and height
[10:22:14] <mbtez_> and $('#elem').width('blah') and $('#elem').height('blah') are apparently leaving it
[10:22:17] <mbtez_> somewhere
[10:22:18] <mbtez_> with value as nil
[10:22:28] <mbtez_> although the actual attribute gets updated, before it displays
[10:22:36] <mbtez_> i.e., it displays correctly
[10:22:55] <mbtez_> specifically i'm trying to use turn.js, which fetches the height and width of the element, to do some calculations
[10:23:28] <mbtez_> so is there some lower level way to say width and height
[10:23:31] <mbtez_> than the one jquery is using?
[10:24:55] <itatitat> ey guys
[10:25:03] <itatitat> im making an autocomplete
[10:25:04] <itatitat> with jquery
[10:25:19] <itatitat> the problem is that elements li no detect the event click
[10:25:33] <itatitat> now Im trying with live
[10:25:39] <itatitat> but not work too
[10:25:48] <shoky> mbtez_, .css('width','20px')
[10:26:15] <mbtez_> i tried that too
[10:26:16] <mbtez_> no good
[10:26:26] <mbtez_>  i'm thinking about appending it onto the stylesheet
[10:26:38] <shoky> no idea what you're trying to do
[10:26:57] <mbtez_> trying to make a div's width and height fill the window
[10:26:58] <shoky> of course there is a lower level way
[10:27:01] <mbtez_> while preserving aspect ratio
[10:27:03] <shoky> javascript + DOM
[10:27:10] <mbtez_> but i can't do it with height:100% etc
[10:27:22] <shoky> only one of them needs to be 100%
[10:27:27] <mbtez_> no
[10:27:29] <shoky> for preserving aspect ratio
[10:27:30] <mbtez_> they both have to be set
[10:27:33] <mbtez_> for turn.js, that's the problem
[10:27:38] <shoky> i didnt say the other one shouldnt be set
[10:27:43] <shoky> one to 100%
[10:27:51] <shoky> the other to the corresponding pixels value
[10:27:53] <mbtez_> gotta have the aspect ratio preserved...
[10:27:57] <shoky> i know
[10:28:05] <mbtez_> that won't work
[10:28:12] <shoky> sure it will
[10:28:22] <mbtez_> it def. won't
[10:28:27] <mbtez_> trust me
[10:28:27] <shoky> you do want either the height or the width filled, no?
[10:28:33] <shoky> i do not trust you ;)
[10:28:36] <mbtez_> yes but the aspect ratio has to be preserved
[10:28:39] <shoky> so what?
[10:28:47] <shoky> lets say aspect ratio = 1:1
[10:28:47] <mbtez_> what do you mean so what
[10:28:53] <mbtez_> it's 1.5466:1
[10:28:56] <shoky> ok
[10:29:12] <shoky> so height:100%
[10:29:16] <shoky> then get the pixel value of that
[10:29:26] <shoky> and multiply/divide by your aspect ratio
[10:29:28] <mbtez_> yeah but turn.js wants both of them set
[10:29:32] <shoky> to set the proper width value
[10:29:36] <shoky> i have no idea what turn.js is
[10:29:38] <mbtez_> and it won't accept jQuery's method of setting it
[10:29:41] <mbtez_> hence my initial question
[10:29:45] <mbtez_> it's a page turning plugin
[10:29:53] <mbtez_> i've been hacking it all morning
[10:29:54] <shoky> ok..
[10:30:03] <shoky> if you fiddle something i can try to help further
[10:30:56] <xenaxon> PacaPaca: It works on jsfiddle just don't know exactly why it doesn't in the website I'm trying to implament it
[10:31:24] <MysterOnyx> I want to make a site where there is a database of different foods with various properties (fat, calories, vitamins, etc). I want the user to be able to drag and drop different foods onto a plate in the center. As they drop foods, a tally on the side shows them the total calories, fat, vitamins, etc. Which languages would be the best to do this in? I'm thinking a mysql database with php. Would javascript or jquery make more sens
[10:31:51] <shoky> jquery for sure..
[10:32:11] <MysterOnyx> shoky I imagine I should store the foods and their properties in mysql?
[10:32:12] <Christer> Definetly jquery
[10:32:26] <mbtez_> oh wait a minute...
[10:32:26] <shoky> MysterOnyx that really depends on the scope of this project..
[10:32:35] <westg> nosql
[10:32:36] <shoky> you don't need a database for 100 food items..
[10:32:43] <itatitat> hi!
[10:32:53] <itatitat> why my element Li, in an autocomplete
[10:33:00] <itatitat> no detect the event click?
[10:33:05] <shoky> because you didnt jsfiddle it
[10:33:17] <itatitat> jsfddle?
[10:33:19] <shoky> ?demo @ itatitat
[10:33:19] <itatitat> whot?
[10:33:20] <bot-t> itatitat, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[10:33:24] <MysterOnyx> shoky so the number of foods would indicate whether I need a database?
[10:33:30] <shoky> not just that

[10:35:16] <MysterOnyx> shoky I'm not very good with javascript, but I could try it
[10:35:19] <hlveheart> didn't update my jquery.
[10:35:19] <hlveheart> http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/f9CA3/5/
[10:35:24] <mbtez_> ahhaha oh wow
[10:35:26] <mbtez_> what a cool script!
[10:35:46] <mbtez_> needs a little tweaking tho
[10:36:21] <chilversc_> for some reason, the [attribute="value"] selector doesn't seem to work for me
[10:36:30] <chilversc_> even the standard demo page @ http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/ fails
[10:36:34] <hlveheart> anybody? o,0
[10:36:34] <shoky> MysterOnyx, var myFoodDatabase = { name: "myFoodDatabase", foodItems: [ { name: "banana", calories: 700 }, { name: "hotdog", calories: 250 } ] };
[10:36:39] <shoky> should get you started
[10:37:11] <pifantastic> ?p @ chilversc
[10:37:11] <bot-t> chilversc, Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://paste.pocoo.org/+js, http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:37:13] <MysterOnyx> shoky thanks I'll start with that. I appreciate the help
[10:37:20] <shoky> ;)
[10:37:38] <chilversc_> pifantastic: I was trying the code on the http://api.jquery.com/attribute-equals-selector/ page, it does nothing
[10:38:16] <hlveheart> How come the show isn't working?.. http://jsfiddle.net/hlve/f9CA3/5/
[10:38:55] <pifantastic> chilversc_: hmm, I see
[10:39:24] <chilversc_> for anyone that want's to play with said code from the jquery example, http://jsfiddle.net/8pP8q/
[10:39:53] <RandalSchwartz> s/want's/wants/
[10:40:12] <pifantastic> chilversc_: that code works
[10:40:25] <shoky> hlveheart you're only checking each radio button in its own click handler
[10:40:27] <pifantastic> it changes <span>name?</span> to Hot Fuzz
[10:40:36] <chilversc_> ah yeah, doh, I mis-read what it was supposed to be doing
[10:40:48] <pifantastic> chilversc_: it is admittedly a silly example
[10:40:52] <hlveheart> shoky; ;/?
[10:41:00] <shoky> hlveheart sec..
[10:41:06] <hlveheart> thanks
[10:41:58] <shoky> hlveheart you need to figure out what your full expected result is
[10:42:07] <shoky> only then you can figure out how to properly code it
[10:42:35] <hlveheart> Shoky, I couldn't really place all of my coding into jsfiddle as it it's in ASP on my website
[10:42:48] <shoky> you put a click handler on the first radio button, inside that click handler you are only checking if THAT SAME radio is checked
[10:42:59] <shoky> it will always be checked, because u just clicked it!
[10:43:01] <hlveheart> but basically, It's a conditional form, where certain fields become hidden when you select a specific radio
[10:43:03] <jes> Should all of my jquery code go into document.ready() ?
[10:43:09] <shoky> hlveheart read what i said.
[10:43:36] <shoky> jes, only the part that you want running when the DOM is ready.
[10:43:41] <shoky> which might be all of it ;P
[10:43:47] <jes> :)
[10:43:49] <hlveheart> i understand that, but I don't know what to do to get to my expected result
[10:43:57] <hlveheart> lol
[10:44:09] <shoky> hlveheart, when the first radio button is clicked,
[10:44:14] <jes> What would be an example where I want to run something before the DOM is ready?
[10:44:17] <shoky> do you want to ONLY check that same radio button's status?
[10:44:42] <Agamemnus> me being here is only temporary.
[10:44:42] <shoky> jes, something that doesn't interact with the DOM, for example
[10:44:53] <shoky> you will never leave
[10:45:01] <Agamemnus> If I have var calc_form = $(parent.document).find('#calc-form') , I can do: calc_form.submit()
[10:45:09] <Agamemnus> why can't I do calc_form.appendChild (x) ?
[10:45:25] <shoky> appendChild is a DOM API function
[10:45:30] <shoky> calc_form is not a DOM element object
[10:45:32] <shoky> it's a jquery object
[10:45:38] <shoky> you can .append() though
[10:45:44] <Agamemnus> is that similar then?
[10:46:06] <shoky> yeah. tho best to see ?append
[10:46:06] <bot-t> .append(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, to the end of each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/append/
[10:46:47] <hlveheart> shoky, so what should I change about my coding? I understand it's not the correct approach, but google didn't help me much
[10:46:54] <Agamemnus> thank you
[10:47:11] <hlveheart> Basically I need it to show certain fields, and hide others if specific radios are selected.
[10:47:24] <youngin> Eviltwin: hey
[10:48:19] <shoky> hlveheart you didnt answer my question
[10:48:24] <shoky> google wont help you figure out what you want
[10:48:26] <reecefowell> i have an event for a button click, $("input[name^='check_all_for_']").click(function(event) how can i get the button that was clicked from the event so i can check stuff like  .is(':checked') ?
[10:48:36] <hlveheart> i didn't see a question ;?
[10:48:53] <shoky>  <shoky> hlveheart, when the first radio button is clicked,  do you want to ONLY check that same radio button's status?
[10:49:34] <hlveheart> well, it's a radio so only one can be selected. so I'm guessing yea
[10:49:53] <shoky> each radio is a seperate element
[10:50:03] <shoky> why would you need to guess?
[10:50:07] <jes> My ajax call returns some data to a div. How do I make this div toggle after 5 secs or so?
[10:50:12] <shoky> figure out what you want..
[10:50:59] <shoky> jes: setTimeout, and .toggle
[10:52:01] <shoky> hlveheart, this might be a bit more in line with what you're trying to do:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/f9CA3/8/
[10:52:11] <shoky> but i'm not gonna try to figure out what you want, for you ;p
[10:54:23] <hlveheart> ;P That's more so what I was looking for. Sorry I couldn't answer you, I didn't understand the question
[10:54:59] <shokshok> er
[10:55:02] <shokshok> dono if you got this-
[10:55:08] <shokshok> hlveheart, this might be a bit more in line with what you're trying to do:  http://jsfiddle.net/antishok/f9CA3/8/
[10:55:54] <devkinetic> can anyone assist me with animating my slider? It loads divs via ajax and shides them into/out of view. Specifically i can't figure out how to animate sliding left/right when the items are added dynamically
[10:56:01] <hlveheart> i did
[10:56:13] <hlveheart> ;P That's more so what I was looking for. Sorry I couldn't answer you, I didn't understand the question
[10:56:14] <hlveheart> Thanks
[10:56:23] <shokshok> np
[10:57:43] <hlveheart> the only problem I run into with that is that the names of the radios are created dynamically with ASP
[10:58:01] <shoky> yes, that's very gross
[10:58:13] <hlveheart> not my choice.
[10:58:28] <shoky> wasnt blaming you ;)
[10:58:29] <hlveheart> Could I use .value isntead of name ;P
[10:58:41] <shoky> where?
[10:58:56] <shoky> in the selector?
[10:59:11] <hlveheart> ah you know, that wouldn't work either
[10:59:37] <shoky> best if they all had a shared class
[10:59:44] <shoky> then you could just $('.className')
[11:01:48] <devkinetic> :(
[11:02:02] <shoky> ?demo @ devkinetic
[11:02:02] <bot-t> devkinetic, Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[11:02:13] <shoky> no sad facey
[11:02:41] <devkinetic> shoky: dev.development.tcia.org/events/industry-calendar haha i was just expressing myself
[11:03:31] <shoky> ^_^
[11:04:53] <hlveheart> shoky, if i add an id or class to either of them, it just wraps them in spans with said tag.
[11:05:09] <hlveheart> asp is horrible
[11:05:26] <shoky> sounds grooooooooooss ;p
[11:05:33] <lenswipe> hlveheart, yes. yes it is
[11:05:35] <hlveheart> it is, it's making my jquerying hard ;/
[11:05:45] <lenswipe> hlveheart, orlynao? ;)
[11:05:48] <devkinetic> http://dev.development.tcia.org/events/industry-calendar is my slider/carousel. I'm trying to add a sliding animation to prev/next. code is here:  http://dev.development.tcia.org/sites/development.tcia.org/modules/custom/tcia_events/calendar_selection.js
[11:06:19] <lenswipe> guys how do i validate a form with jquery
[11:06:35] <jes> I have $("#log").html( msg ); $("#log").hide(3000); It disspears nicely after showing the message. The problem is that if I don't refresh the page and call the ajax again, the message doesn't appear. Any ideas to make the message appear again? Doing $("#log").show() after .hide() acts funky.
[11:06:36] <shoky> there are plugins
[11:06:38] <shoky> for validation
[11:06:40] <nir0> hello, need some quick help - i've got some script, that should not run if textfield or textarea is focused
[11:07:06] <nir0> roughly - anything is focused
[11:07:43] <nir0> how do i check that
[11:08:19] <ashka> hello
[11:08:55] <ashka> I wanted to know what should I use to select all elements that have class .abo and that have inside the element that have class .abo, a element which has class .seen
[11:09:27] <ashka> here I am so far : $('.seen div.abo').each(..);
[11:09:30] <ashka> but this doesn't work
[11:09:33] <ashka> am I doing something wrong ?
[11:09:42] <nir0> found - $(':focus').size() > 0
[11:09:53] <jes> How do I clear .html from a div? .html('') ?
[11:10:03] <NoiseEee> $('.abo').find('.seen') if you're asking to find elements with the class "seen" that are inside of elements with a class "abo"
[11:10:17] <NoiseEee> jes: empty()
[11:10:23] <ashka> NoiseEee: not exactly
[11:10:34] <ashka> I inversed the two names in the precedent line
[11:10:46] <ashka> I want to select the .abo thing when it has a div that has class .seen inside it
[11:11:05] <ashka> like, <div class="abo"><div class="seen"></div></div> would be selected
[11:11:17] <ashka> <div class="abo"><div class="watched"></div></div> wouldn't
[11:11:46] <NoiseEee> ashka: you can either look for .seen and ask if a parent div has class .abo,  or you can look for .abo and find child div's that have the class .seen
[11:12:13] <ashka> I'd prefer looking if a child div has .seen... The element structure may vary
[11:12:39] <shoky> $('.abo').children('.seen')
[11:12:50] <shoky> er
[11:12:55] <shoky> scratch that.
[11:13:12] <ashka> thanks
[11:15:41] <ashka> shoky: the children can be at any level ? and it would select the .seen, isn't it ?
[11:15:56] <ashka> I would select the .abo element if it has .seen in it
[11:16:20] <xenaxon> help.
[11:16:46] <xenaxon> Is there any way to execute a script halfway through the FadeIn animation?
[11:17:03] <xenaxon> or at a particular point in time of the animation
[11:17:22] <shoky> ashka: $('.abo').has('.seen')
[11:17:30] <shoky> would select abo
[11:17:59] <ashka> okay
[11:18:00] <ashka> thanks
[11:18:02] <shoky> np
[11:18:03] <NoiseEee> nice shoky
[11:18:20] <shoky> ya just found about .has myself ;)
[11:18:40] <ashka> :d
[11:18:49] <ashka> shoky: the .seen can be at any level ?
[11:19:02] <shoky> hmm i think so
[11:19:04] <shoky> ?has
[11:19:04] <bot-t> .has(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that have a descendant that matches the selector or DOM element. http://api.jquery.com/has/
[11:19:08] <shoky> descendant
[11:19:10] <shoky> so yeah
[11:19:36] <shoky> never tried it myself though
[11:21:20] <ashka> $('.abonnementDetailItem').each(function() { if ($(this).has('.episode-seen')) $(this).css("opacity","0.5"); }); > this doesn't seems to be working
[11:21:30] <ashka> I tried playing the has before .each too
[11:21:34] <ashka> placing*
[11:23:43] <shoky> $('.abonnementDetailItem').has('.episode-seen').css('opacity','0.5')
[11:23:57] <dunivan> is there a way to hide or show content and dynamically change the url when it is done
[11:24:13] <dunivan> so that the change registers a second event for google analytics
[11:24:17] <dunivan> with jQuery?
[11:24:23] <shoky> anything is possible
[11:24:39] <shoky> how about sticking to one question though
[11:25:45] <dunivan> well I know I can show hide
[11:26:05] <dunivan> so how do I dynamically impact the url to show a second step for the purposes of bounce rate
[11:26:06] <zackiv31> how can i submit a jQuery form object skipping all handlers attached to the forms submit() ?
[11:26:15] <shoky> impact the url?
[11:26:17] <shoky> lol.
[11:26:19] <dunivan> right
[11:26:29] <shoky> window.location.href = 'url'
[11:26:33] <shoky> is one way to impact it
[11:26:54] <dunivan> so i have abcdomain.com/short-content.html -> abcdomain.com/short-content.html?readmore=yes
[11:27:00] <dunivan> or something like that
[11:27:04] <shoky> ok
[11:27:25] <dunivan> and readmore is added when you click the readmore link in the content
[11:27:30] <shoky> k
[11:29:37] <ashka> hm
[11:29:44] <ashka> I have some kinda of bug with $.attr
[11:30:00] <ashka> $.attr("href","#") does modify the attr
[11:30:06] <ashka> oh
[11:30:08] <ashka> nevermind
[11:30:59] <lrvick> Anyone with basic ML experience want to lend and advice on my NaiveBayes implementation? https://github.com/Tawlk/gest/blob/master/gest.js
[11:33:36] <jes> I have a checkbox in a td. Can I say that td is the checkboxes parent?
[11:33:53] <shoky> if it's the parent, sure.
[11:44:13] <dunivan> any ideas shoky?
[11:44:23] <dunivan> i figured out how to rewrite the url on click
[11:44:36] <shoky> any ideas about what?
[11:44:51] <dunivan> but if it is /short-content.html?readmore=yes i can't make new content appear
[11:45:02] <shoky> what?
[11:45:39] <lenswipe> hey guys
[11:45:48] <shoky> hy
[11:45:49] <lenswipe> can someone help out with jquery append() and <select> elements
[11:45:56] <shoky> havent you learned
[11:45:59] <shoky> ?ask
[11:45:59] <bot-t> If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[11:46:19] <lenswipe> sorry i shouldve clarified
[11:46:30] <shoky> no
[11:46:38] <shoky> you need to clarify when something is misunderstood
[11:46:42] <lenswipe> jquery append() doesnt work in IE with select and im not sure what to do, lemme put a pastebin up
[11:46:56] <gehsekky> jsfiddle
[11:47:04] <shoky> ^
[11:47:20] <gehsekky> pastebin is for when you're anon and want to put up stolen cc info
[11:47:36] <shoky> ;)
[11:52:05] <lenswipe> shoky, sure you want a jsfiddle?
[11:52:42] <shoky> we need to see the problem, no?
[11:53:47] <devkinetic> if i have a div hidden with display:none, how can i animate it to show sliding into view from right to left?
[11:54:12] <lenswipe> shoky, well its just that its ajax so it relies on data coming from the server that requires authentication
[11:54:17] <lenswipe> shoky, but ill do my best
[11:54:47] <lenswipe> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/Tqvx5/
[11:54:47] <shoky> lenswipe, pastebin it for all i care, i donno how good the help you get will be though
[11:54:56] <lenswipe> basically im trying to get that to work in IE
[11:55:02] <lenswipe> appending <option>s
[11:55:11] <lenswipe> note: the jsfiddle example doesnt work
[11:55:32] <shoky> the point was to see the problem in action
[11:55:48] <lenswipe> shoky, http://jsfiddle.net/Tqvx5/1/ try that one
[11:56:20] <shoky> works for me in IE.
[11:56:43] <shoky> let's try IE8.
[11:57:08] <shoky> works there too
[11:57:43] <shoky> IE7 as well ;P
[11:57:53] <lenswipe> O_O
[11:58:05] <lenswipe> why is IE such a peice of shit?
[11:58:07] <lenswipe> #fuckmicrosoft
[11:58:21] <shoky> are you on some lame compatibility mode maybe?
[11:58:36] <shoky> i had that prob a while ago, drove me nuts
[11:59:44] <shoky> see how the fiddle saved me work? i didnt even peek at your code
[11:59:47] <shoky> :)

[12:01:18] <jrockjiggz> hi all, what is the best way to go through a list of 15+ vars and if(var == false){ //do something }
[12:02:13] <jrockjiggz> var a,b,c,d;  if(a == false){ runA(); } if(b == false){ runB(); }
[12:03:11] <Eviltwin> Why in God's name did you use 15 vars for that?
[12:03:29] <Eviltwin> Use var obj = { a: ..., b: ..., c: ..., d: ... };
[12:03:29] <jrockjiggz> validate. each field has a var,
[12:03:40] <jrockjiggz> hmm
[12:03:49] <Eviltwin> Then for(var k in obj) { if(obj[k] == false) run(k); }
[12:03:50] <Eviltwin> Or something like that
[12:04:01] <jrockjiggz> var email = ( validEmail() ) ? true : false;
[12:04:19] <jrockjiggz> if(email === false){ $('#email').focus(); }
[12:04:36] <Eviltwin> Why did you do that?
[12:04:44] <Eviltwin> That's a terribly unscalable design
[12:05:56] <jrockjiggz> hmm i couldn't find a better way.. the validEmail handles the stringcheck, and launches a tooltip with specifics
[12:06:59] <jrockjiggz> i broke up strCheck for each type, validFunctions to handle how to behave in each scenario, and now a submit event that goes through everything

[12:07:26] <jrockjiggz> i've gone through that. its very good
[12:08:26] <mbtez_> what's a script i can throw into my console

[12:14:12] <mbtez_> interopcop: which div?
[12:14:28] <mbtez_> scheduled_change_state_date?
[12:14:32] <Dr4g> Can you guys help me develop a callback function that is triggered between 3 and 5 seconds. - So the setInterval seconds could be, 3000, 4000 or 5000.
[12:14:38] <Brodingo_> interopcop you need to be using classes instead of id for multiple elements
[12:14:47] <mbtez_> ^
[12:14:48] <interopcop> the scheduled_change_state_link
[12:14:51] <mbtez_> and then use .each method
[12:14:53] <mbtez_> google it
[12:15:02] <interopcop> use classes then use .each
[12:15:09] <interopcop> does that change my jquery significantly?
[12:15:14] <mbtez_> not really no
[12:15:18] <mbtez_> each is a loop function

[12:49:47] <noktulo> I'm using queues for the first time. For some reason, the first few images in the slideshow I'm building appear simultaneously, rather than being queued. After that, the rest of the images appear sequentially as they're supposed to.
[12:49:50] <Dr4g> Guys, I have a simple for() loop, with a setTimeout() inside it. The array keys are 0, 1. However my problem is when i'm inside the setTimout callback the key is 1, 1. My code example is here: http://jsfiddle.net/cnMLU/
[12:49:55] <interopcop> nFFF do I really need on click for this?  I have in the past just given a div selector with .toggle and it's worked fine.  http://jsfiddle.net/yUkXf/6/
[12:50:04] <noktulo> The page is at http://pompeiad.com/test/test2.php if anyone can help
[12:50:58] <nFFF> interopcop I think one of us is confused, you said you wanted to show divs based on when someone _click_ another element?
[12:51:07] <interopcop> yes
[12:51:17] <interopcop> .toggle ha always responded to the div's click
[12:51:28] <nFFF> ok just looked at your code
[12:51:29] <interopcop> I'm sorry I keep saying div I mean anchor
[12:51:45] <interopcop> click the anchor, toggle a class's display propery
[12:51:50] <nFFF> why have you inlined half yor javascript?
[12:51:57] <interopcop> in the html?
[12:51:58] <nFFF> its hard to follow, it looks a mess
[12:52:01] <nFFF> yea
[12:52:06] <interopcop> that's what rails does *for me*
[12:52:18] <interopcop> I can whack it if you'd like
[12:52:22] <NoiseEee> with an outstretched arm
[12:52:31] <interopcop> should be immaterial to this, but ... maybe not?
[12:52:56] <interopcop> NoiseEee: no, curved slightly inward
[12:53:20] <nFFF> Your task is extremely simple to do, simply bind a click event to the first element, in the handler toggle the second
[12:54:21] <interopcop> ok I have multiple first elements, so I have to use .each, which I haven't used before
[12:54:33] <interopcop> but I think I understand how to use it
[12:54:58] <interopcop> bt the next problem is, when I've identified the function and which class to pply it to, I have to identify the target of the function
[12:55:09] <nFFF> no
[12:55:13] <nFFF> you don't
[12:55:25] <interopcop> ...know how to use .each?
[12:55:30] <nFFF> need to even use it
[12:55:54] <nFFF> $('.foo').click(..) // binds to all instances of .foo
[12:56:55] <interopcop> what about $('.foo').toggle(..)?
[12:57:38] <nFFF> youll then hide/show all instances
[12:58:02] <blendedbychris> is it possible to get the hostname only of an anchor?

[13:00:50] <Christer> any tips for a PHP / HTML dev channel ?

[13:01:14] <neersighted> ##php
[13:01:16] <Christer> #php is invite only
[13:01:24] <neersighted> ##javascript
[13:01:26] <interopcop> nFFF: what if I want to hide/show only one instance?
[13:01:28] <neersighted> #css
[13:01:40] <shoky> hlveheart i m here
[13:01:42] <xmaddness> php isn't invite only, you just need to be registered
[13:01:45] <NoiseEee> Christer: ##php or #web for general stuff
[13:01:54] <nFFF> interopcop, well your first task is to figure out which instance you want to hide
[13:02:23] <nFFF> jQuery will basically return an array of DOM elements
[13:02:32] <nFFF> or an object that contains them at leas
[13:02:58] <nFFF> so you can just use standard [n] to access nth instance
[13:03:15] <nFFF> or theres also ?get or ?eq i forget which one
[13:03:34] <nFFF> one returns the dom object and one returns the jquery object
[13:03:41] <nFFF> think get() returns jquery
[13:03:43] <nFFF> ?get
[13:03:43] <bot-t> .get([index]): Retrieve the DOM elements matched by the jQuery object. http://api.jquery.com/get/
[13:03:46] <Brodingo_> get and [0] get the element
[13:03:50] <nFFF> ?eq
[13:03:50] <bot-t> .eq(index): Reduce the set of matched elements to the one at the specified index. http://api.jquery.com/eq/
[13:03:53] <Brodingo_> eq gets the jquery object
[13:03:56] <nFFF> yea sorry eq does
[13:04:32] <danielfilho> o'hai :)
[13:04:41] <shoky> all hail
[13:04:57] <beekir> hi kids.  I'm trying to run a filter against a set of :input:visible elements, and I'm getting a crazy exception from chrome about 'defaultView' not being a property of undefined.
[13:05:01] <danielfilho> that's the best way to use .live() nowadays? saw things saying bad things, and that it's going to be deprecatedâ€¦
[13:05:13] <danielfilho> might someone recommend me any documentation? or something like that? :)
[13:05:21] <Brodingo_> ?on @ danielfilho
[13:05:21] <bot-t> danielfilho, .on() is the jQuery 1.7+ preferred way of handling all event bindings: Attach an event handler function for one or more events to the selected elements, including delegation and live binding. http://api.jquery.com/on/
[13:05:26] <beekir> if you have a chance to look, i'm getting a 'defaultView' exception trying to access the .css() properties of some $(':input:visible') collection: http://pastebin.com/cy2aUHgv
[13:05:54] <danielfilho> oh, been using .on() for click and some other handlers! thanks Brodingo_ :)
[13:06:09] <beekir> danielfilho:  i just became aware of .live() today and it's already deprecated in favor of .on() -- good luck, because all of the "event" documentation still says to use .bind() ;)
[13:06:44] <interopcop> the div to hide/show is the next div after the <a>, does that help?
[13:07:09] <sphinxxx> if i have a string, but its the name of the object, how do i "turn it into" a referencable object again
[13:07:22] <sphinxxx> eg. if the string is "foo"
[13:07:23] <supsup> put it in braces
[13:07:27] <supsup> []
[13:07:33] <sphinxxx> but i need to access foo.val
[13:07:35] <supsup> o sorry misread
[13:07:39] <beekir> sphinxxx:  parentContainer['yourStringHere'] == parentContainer.yourStringHere
[13:08:19] <sphinxxx> not sure if i'm explaining it right
[13:08:20] <mrpmeth> can i put a negative in a selector, such as i want everything that is not a td for example
[13:08:43] <supsup> use eval to troll room
[13:08:51] <Brodingo_> ?not # mrpmeth
[13:08:51] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/#mrpmeth
[13:08:57] <Brodingo_> bah
[13:09:15] <sphinxxx> e.g., recaptcha has objects for different languages
[13:09:17] <shoky> you gave away his ID!!
[13:09:22] <sphinxxx> RecaptchaStr_fr, RecaptchaStr_es,  etc.
[13:09:41] <sphinxxx> I want to concatenate the language onto RecaptchaStr_  , and then reference as an object
[13:09:54] <sphinxxx> e.g. RecaptchaStr_ + lang  , and then be able to reference that as the object
[13:10:15] <Brodingo_> mrpmeth just be careful and dont do stupid shit like *:not(td)
[13:10:30] <mrpmeth> thanks Brodingo_
[13:10:35] <mrpmeth> that's what i was looking for
[13:10:42] <Brodingo_> cool beans
[13:10:48] <beekir> $('input:visible').filter(function(el){ $(el).css('visibility') }) is throwing exceptions in chrome and I am trying to determine if this is a jquery bug (or work around it)  http://pastebin.com/cy2aUHgv

[13:11:15] <shoky> NO U
[13:11:24] <beekir> lol
[13:11:39] <sphinxxx> supsup: here, but it won't be fully functional.. http://jsfiddle.net/radGT/
[13:12:07] <nFFF> beekir, your using filter totally wrong?
[13:12:08] <supsup> so lang would be server side output?
[13:12:18] <beekir> nFFF:  how so?
[13:12:28] <supsup> replace server side stuff with string equivs
[13:12:53] <beekir> nFFF:  The demo I sent you shows "return 1" and following that is the commented code that causes exception
[13:12:58] <nFFF> .filter(function(indexofElement) { return boolean; }) // think this is the right waay
[13:13:12] <nFFF> Ok didnt check the demo
[13:13:14] <supsup> nm it's part of function call ~
[13:13:15] <nFFF> sec
[13:13:17] <beekir> return 1 is not boolean?  in the comment, the == operator does not return boolean?
[13:13:30] <nFFF> yea sorry i just ready your IRC line
[13:13:34] <nFFF> didn't check pastebin sec
[13:13:47] <nFFF> 1 is ot a boolean
[13:13:50] <nFFF> !!!1 is
[13:13:55] <nFFF> !!1 sorry
[13:14:04] <beekir> 1 evaluates to boolean as true, it works (trust me, the problem is not with the 1!!!!!!)
[13:14:23] <supsup> so whats this function not doing what you expect it to do sphinxxx
[13:14:30] <supsup> add comments to your example
[13:14:33] <supsup> expected vs actual
[13:14:39] <beekir> no exceptions in the pastebin as is, because the offending code is commented out (Eg:  return $(el).css('visibility') == 'visible';  )
[13:14:53] <adoven> beekir: change it to $(this).css('visibility')
[13:15:12] <nFFF> well yea
[13:15:28] <nFFF> re-read my explanation
[13:15:34] <nFFF> .filter(function(indexofElement) { return boolean; })
[13:15:43] <nFFF> and then you are doing $(indexofElement) //
[13:15:45] <supsup> like how are you accessing a property that is never set also?  .visual_challenge
[13:16:00] <nFFF> indexofelement will return an integer index
[13:16:06] <nFFF> not an obj
[13:16:17] <supsup> u create this object on the fly, then never set a visual_challenge property then access that non-existant property
[13:16:54] <nFFF> try using $(this)
[13:17:09] <sphinxxx> supsup: its hard to demonstrate in jsfiddle, because you can't see all the recaptcha objects
[13:17:13] <sphinxxx> they all exist already
[13:17:27] <beekir> nFFF:  Thank you for getting "indexOf" through my thick skull.
[13:17:37] <supsup> it's prob easy to demo u just don't know how ;-0
[13:18:00] <danielfilho> (ok, I already love .on(). Sorry for this! :D)
[13:18:05] <supsup> i run into that problem a lot
[13:18:06] <beekir> adoven:  thanks for your help.  $(this) is working for me.  I tend to get confused about the value of "this", and saw two different potential values for "this"

[13:18:19] <nFFF> beekir, at least we got there :D
[13:18:46] <beekir> nFFF:  I will have to think about the usefulness of passing index vs element.  there has to be something useful you can do in a filter with an index ;)
[13:18:48] <Dr4g> gnarf: are you still around dude? I have setTimeout() intervals for 3000, 6000, 9000, 12000. However after about 5 seconds they all load at the same time. Anyone is welcome to give this a try
[13:18:55] <Dr4g> for(var i in intervalMap) { setTimeout(doIframeSrc(i, intervalMap[i].url), intervalMap[i].time); }
[13:19:06] <beekir> hahaha
[13:19:24] <beekir> Dr4g I think I know your problem:  doIframeSrc() is executed at the time of your call to setTimeout
[13:20:02] <beekir> perhaps you mean doIframeSrc (no parens == pass function as argument, vs execute function and pass its return as argument)
[13:20:10] <nFFF> yea wrap it in an anon function
[13:20:34] <beekir> Dr4g:  for(var i in intervalMap) { setTimeout(function(){doIframeSrc(i, intervalMap[i].url)}, intervalMap[i].time); }
[13:21:02] <Dr4g> ah, perhaps.
[13:21:19] <beekir> nFFF and adoven, thanks once again for helping out a stranger.  adios
[13:21:25] <nFFF> :>
[13:22:21] <beekir> nFFF:  filter(function(index)) could be usefull if you care about things like first element, last element, odd vs even, etc.  (just trying to think of usefulness of the param)
[13:22:25] <beekir> sure you already know that ;)
[13:22:37] <beekir> and it remains relevant for $(this)
[13:23:40] <Dr4g> i'll whack in another anon function for the setTimeout.

[13:30:42] <gnarf> nFFF: for arrays
[13:30:53] <beekir> nFFF:  bad call for arrays.  OK for arbitrary objects
[13:30:55] <gnarf> nFFF: key in object works fine though
[13:31:17] <Dr4g> gnarf: hey, perhaps you can spot the issue in my small pastebin above?
[13:31:25] <adoven> Dr4g: intervalMap[numCalls].time should be intervalMap[i], no?
[13:31:43] <Dr4g> adoven: i and numCalls are the same
[13:31:59] <Dr4g> 'i' wasn't being unique within each callback.
[13:32:24] <adoven> numCalls is 0, intervalMap[0] would be 3000 or whatever, right?
[13:32:25] <beekir> Dr4g:  I would have to see intervalMap to make sure that you're making sense ;)
[13:32:25] <Dr4g> so numCalls is now used to keep the incrementing flowing with the callback sequence.
[13:32:30] <Dr4g> adoven: that's correct.
[13:32:33] <Dr4g> beekir: okay.
[13:32:49] <interopcop> this would be easier if there was some way to troubleshoot step-by-step, like a console you could login to, issue selector strings and see if anything came back... :(
[13:32:53] <adoven> maybe i'm just misunderstanding what intervalMap is then
[13:33:11] <NoiseEee> interopcop: i know right?!
[13:33:24] <beekir>  don't know if i'm being trolled or not....
[13:33:36] <shoky> maybe ur the troll
[13:33:39] <beekir> could be
[13:33:58] <beekir> hell, i came here confused over something as simple as $(this)
[13:34:03] <gotenks_ssj6> var username = "fff";
[13:34:07] <gotenks_ssj6> is right?
[13:34:13] <krong> hello, if you look at this website http://kdt.outsourcejobstome.com/ you will see on top right move header down, clicking on it i want it that part to slide down, is there any tutorial which can help me do that thanks
[13:34:15] <rupl> is there a straightforward way of dealing with timezones in JS? please someone tell me I'm missing the obvious
[13:34:19] <shoky> beekir let's start fresh, whats your question?
[13:34:34] <interopcop> NoiseEee: you're not helping when you agree with me :)
[13:34:36] <beekir> shoky, i don't even have one.  i was commenting on interopcop and NoiseEee's comments
[13:34:44] <shoky> oh robocop and noisy
[13:34:47] <beekir> krong:  checking it out
[13:35:01] <beekir> krong:  see jquery UI
[13:35:09] <NoiseEee> gotenks_ssj6: sure?
[13:35:21] <gotenks_ssj6> var username = "fff";
[13:35:23] <beekir> krong:  my bad.  actually, jquery has limited support for sliding stuff around like that.  In my experience, IE8 behavior is so crappy that it's not worht using
[13:35:26] <gotenks_ssj6> this is right?
[13:35:28] <Dr4g> adoven: here is intervalMap, it's just an interval number that is incremented by 3000 (3 seconds) each time. http://pastebin.com/UbJkWYXt
[13:35:41] <Dr4g> So the first callback should occur after 3 seconds, then 6 seconds, then 9 seconds.
[13:35:46] <beekir> Dr4g:  That's no map!
[13:35:48] <Dr4g> but they all come at the same time :S
[13:35:48] <NoiseEee> gotenks_ssj6: i guess it's as right as var username = 'bbb'?  what is your question?
[13:35:50] <shoky> agreed about IE8 and sliding stuff ;p
[13:35:58] <shoky> and suckage, of course.
[13:36:16] <gotenks_ssj6> just to know
[13:36:18] <beekir> shoky:  i'm irritated as hell right now with IE8 ;)  as usual, jquery works perfectly in all sane browsers.
[13:36:30] <shoky> ;)
[13:36:31] <adoven> Dr4g: shouldn't it then be setTimeout(function() { blah }, i.time)
[13:36:38] <beekir> Dr4g:  Don't use "for i in intervalMap" because intervalMap is an array.
[13:37:09] <beekir> numCalls also appears to be a total bogus variable in this snippet
[13:38:14] <gotenks_ssj6> NoiseEee see my code
[13:38:28] <NoiseEee> gotenks_ssj6: what about it?
[13:38:55] <Dr4g> Guys i got it working. the numCalls was not being incremented in the correct scope, so setTimeout() was being called with a timout of intervalMap[0].time every time :)
[13:39:02] <gotenks_ssj6> [NoiseEee]: http://pastebin.com/3GHxamD6
[13:39:05] <shoky> guise
[13:39:29] <NoiseEee> gotenks_ssj6: how many times can i answer your question?
[13:39:43] <shoky> there was a question?
[13:39:53] <gotenks_ssj6> until it work
[13:40:01] <gotenks_ssj6> see all the code
[13:40:02] <beekir> Dr4g:  you still should not be using for i in intervalMap
[13:40:08] <NoiseEee> Gotenks_ssj4: $.ajax({url:"post.php",type:"post",data:{text:clientmsg,user:'username'} });    <---- line 66 in your script should look like this
[13:40:13] <gotenks_ssj6> see why it is not posting the var
[13:40:18] <NoiseEee> gotenks_ssj6: use $.ajax instead of $.post
[13:40:20] <shoky> ssj4!
[13:40:27] <NoiseEee> gotenks_ssj6: and all the php in there is irrelevant / not looking at it
[13:40:33] <Dr4g> beekir: adoven .etc - i had to increment numCalls within my for() loop for it to correctly increment in the correct scope: http://pastebin.com/ucdS9dSm
[13:40:41] <beekir> use $.each(intervalMap, function(i,e){  /* "i" is your index, "e" is the actual map.  Do your thing here.  */ });
[13:40:43] <gotenks_ssj6> thanks
[13:40:49] <gotenks_ssj6> i'll check here
[13:41:13] <shoky> if it's a map call it map, not 'i'
[13:41:21] <shoky> er, not 'e'
[13:41:22] <beekir> Dr4g:  I can't help but think you're going to run into trouble when for(var i in intervalMap) returns the property intervalMap.length
[13:41:40] <adoven> Dr4g: yeah listen to beekir. he's leading you in the correct direction
[13:42:05] <beekir> Dr4g:  $.each() is your friend.  shoky didn't like my example, so i guess he volunteers to provide a better one :)
[13:42:15] <shoky> sorry bout that ;)
[13:42:24] <beekir> "don't call it e if it's a map"  -- i'm still trying to get him to not call it "map" when it's an array :)
[13:42:25] <Dr4g> I didn't want to use $.each() for the simple iteration.
[13:42:44] <beekir> Dr4g:  It's (imo) a limitation of javascript.  don't iterate arrays with for / in.
[13:42:58] <beekir> $.each *is* simple iteration :)
[13:43:38] <sphinxxx> is google translate too shitty to put on a professional site?
[13:43:49] <Dr4g> beekir: i'm aware it's not a true map, and maybe my variable name could be intervalList. but i'm not fussed right now.
[13:43:49] <beekir> in other news:  is anyone aware of IE8 bugs using $collection.index($someOtherJQElement) ?
[13:43:58] <shoky> that question is too shitty for a professional site builder
[13:44:10] <Dr4g> and for $.each() here, it's extra fluff in my opinion. don't need it.
[13:44:20] <tw2113> pros have translators that work on demand
[13:44:34] <Dr4g> goodnight guys. peace.
[13:44:37] <beekir> Dr4g:  You're gonna get fussed when your iteration calls intervalMap.doesntExist.url and then throws an exception
[13:44:50] <supsup> all i use is google widgets on my site, u can't even see my site just widgets of google if u close them all then uc an see the site. like big map over the top sectiona nd docs over the bottom and my content is under all that
[13:44:51] <beekir> err, intervalMap[thisIndexDoesntExist].url
[13:45:07] <supsup> so might as well throw a translate on top of that ~~
[13:45:21] <shoky> beekir, i know that IE8 and below don't count empty text nodes as elements, while others do
[13:45:26] <shoky> no idea if that is related to your problem though
[13:45:33] <Dr4g> beekir: I will never reach an undefined index. 'i' is the relative key for intervalMap's iteration.
[13:45:46] <beekir> shoky:  empty text elements could be my problem.  thanks for that tip!
[13:45:50] <shoky> ;)
[13:45:51] <Dr4g> beekir: Please demonstrate a jsfiddle to prove that 'i' will reach an undefined index.
[13:46:45] <Dr4g> 'i' is ofcourse the relative array index for the current iteration of my array.
[13:46:48] <gotenks_ssj6> [NoiseEee]: this is right? ==>> url: <?php echo $username?>".html",
[13:47:04] <shoky> haha.
[13:47:18] <beekir> dr4g:  http://jsfiddle.net/PfM9S/
[13:47:23] <NoiseEee> gotenks_ssj6: is it right?  i don't know.  you have a separate web page for every user?
[13:47:52] <beekir> dr4g:  there's a heck of a lot more "in" an array than you think.  notice, many many many alerts(), not just "1, 2, 3"
[13:47:52] <gotenks_ssj6> i making something to chat with nude girls
[13:47:59] <gotenks_ssj6> so each girl have a page
[13:48:02] <NoiseEee> gotenks_ssj6: then its totally right!!
[13:48:04] <NoiseEee> j/k
[13:48:13] <gotenks_ssj6> \o/
[13:48:16] <gotenks_ssj6> yeahh
[13:48:21] <NoiseEee> gotenks_ssj6: i have no idea dude, you're the architect of your application.
[13:48:26] <gotenks_ssj6> you will code gold member
[13:48:28] <Dr4g> beekir: why doesn't 'i' just contain 0, 1, 2 in your example ?
[13:48:34] <gotenks_ssj6> got*
[13:48:39] <Dr4g> is that because Array extends an Object prototype ?
[13:48:52] <beekir> Dr4g:  because "for i in x" means "for every property in element x" which means that all properties of the array object (yep!) are iterated
[13:49:02] <Dr4g> what the.
[13:49:09] <beekir> for i in x{} // only safe when x is a pure object
[13:49:35] <Dr4g> strange that i've never noticed this before.
[13:49:37] <NoiseEee> Dr4g: you can iterate with a traditional  for(var x = 0; x<lengthOfArray; x++)   or using hasOwnProperty on a for/in
[13:49:37] <beekir> Dr4g:  think of array.length.  "length" is the property name.  When you iterate with for i in array, you are asking to include shit like the length property
[13:49:41] <supsup> beekir http://jsfiddle.net/PfM9S/1/
[13:50:06] <supsup> array[i] if u want value
[13:50:11] <beekir> supsup:  looks uglier than jquery to me ;)
[13:50:20] <Dr4g> beekir: my bad, i was using 'in' here when i wanted to use traditional for() syntax.
[13:50:30] <Dr4g> NoiseEee: thanks for reminding me.
[13:50:32] <beekir> Dr4g:  that's it
[13:50:37] <beekir> now go build a bad ass web app
[13:50:50] <Dr4g> I don't usually use 'in', i just had a brain fart when building this loop
[13:50:50] <bambams> Does jquery-ui-maps load the Google Maps API? :-/
[13:51:03] <beekir> and remember "IN" is not your friend for ARRAYS.  And don't use "map" in your variable names when you really mean "array" :)
[13:51:22] <beekir> I use "in" all the time -- when iterating my own hash objects
[13:51:26] <Dr4g> beekir: for(var i = 0; i < intervalMap.length; i++) {
[13:51:50] <Dr4g> beekir: as i said; i never use IN on arrays, i just had a brain fart.
[13:51:53] <beekir> Dr4g:  that would be it.  i prefer iterators and the scope enclosing of $.each
[13:57:44] <GoGoGarrett> https://gist.github.com/7817c9574997dfa87315 any idea why this switch statement isn't being hit?
[13:57:46] <aghouseh> anyone use a lightweight plugin to stick a footer to the bottom of the page ONLY if content is shorter than window height?
[13:58:36] <aghouseh> GoGoGarrett: because you forgot to close the change(function(){})?
[13:58:42] <aghouseh> or did you just not paste it :)
[13:58:46] <GoGoGarrett> just didn't paste it all
[13:58:48] <GoGoGarrett> sorry
[13:59:20] <GoGoGarrett> if you refresh
[14:00:00] <shoky> case page:
[14:00:09] <shoky> what is page?
[14:00:13] <shoky> oh sry.
[14:00:13] <GoGoGarrett> that regex
[14:00:38] <shoky> switch on a regex? that works?
[14:00:43] <GoGoGarrett> It may not, haha
[14:00:50] <shoky> never seen it or heard of it ;)
[14:00:50] <GoGoGarrett> That's the problem im running into  - that's what i'm wanting
[14:01:04] <shoky> then don't use switch..
[14:01:13] <GoGoGarrett> I have 6 or 7 other options
[14:01:19] <GoGoGarrett> I just pasted what was releviant to the question though
[14:01:36] <shoky> and got your answer
[14:01:57] <GoGoGarrett> How would you go about accomplishing the same functionality though, that I am still unsure of
[14:02:00] <shoky> what's the difference between writing: case SMTH:  ....
[14:02:07] <shoky> and if (SMTH SMTH)  ....
[14:02:07] <shoky> ??
[14:02:09] <shoky> else if
[14:02:13] <shoky> if and else if
[14:02:14] <GoGoGarrett> It's messy.
[14:02:20] <shoky> so's regex
[14:02:31] <GoGoGarrett> That's the only reason to accomplish dynamic data.
[14:02:36] <shoky> wat.
[14:02:40] <GoGoGarrett> That's the only way*
[14:02:53] <GoGoGarrett> because /pages/19 will be different depending on the pages created in the backend
[14:03:01] <shoky> how is 'else if'  more messy than   case:
[14:03:02] <shoky> ??
[14:03:10] <shoky> you're messy
[14:03:24] <GoGoGarrett> https://gist.github.com/7817c9574997dfa87315 look at this again
[14:03:26] <aghouseh> im partial to cases myself
[14:03:29] <shoky> go code that shit, clean it up later if you're not happy with the messiness factor
[14:03:35] <shoky> i.e. refactor
[14:03:38] <GoGoGarrett> It's a lot more clean, then having  6 or 7 elseif's
[14:03:45] <supsup> beekir: perhaps u might find interesting (random) http://jsperf.com/each-vs-in-array
[14:03:51] <shoky> that is not clean at all
[14:03:56] <shoky> it is ugly, really
[14:03:57] <GoGoGarrett> More than else if's
[14:04:00] <shoky> not at all
[14:04:21] <shoky> don't need any breaks with if
[14:04:23] <GoGoGarrett> This ignorant arguing is not helping me with my problem ;)
[14:04:37] <shoky> i see.
[14:05:29] <yedimind> we can switch to a completely different topic of ignorant arguing if you'd prefer
[14:05:30] <chee> i disagree with GoGoGarrett
[14:05:34] <shoky> and you have <% %>  code in between your cases
[14:05:40] <GoGoGarrett> It is rails
[14:05:41] <shoky> you are the messiest of them all
[14:05:44] <shoky> loser..
[14:06:07] <chee> lol please calm down
[14:06:11] <shoky> rails/php/asp/jsp/CGI who cares

[14:06:32] <yedimind> shoky, <% %> is just a javascrtip driven microtemplating syntax
[14:06:34] <yedimind> whats the problem with that?
[14:06:37] <yedimind> javascript too
[14:06:49] <shoky> <% %> is not javascript sir
[14:07:01] <yedimind> javascript microtemplating uses that syntax
[14:07:03] <gotenks_ssj6> this is right?
[14:07:05] <shoky> so?
[14:07:06] <gehsekky> yedimind: which microtemplating library?

[14:09:31] <shoky> YOU CANT SWITCH WITH A REGEX
[14:09:35] <shoky> i gave you your answer flat out
[14:09:38] <shoky> whats the problem??
[14:09:41] <gehsekky> GoGoGarrett: to be fair, if he was trying to help, why would you call him ignorant/stupid?
[14:09:53] <GoGoGarrett> He was insulting my code instead of helping.
[14:09:56] <shoky> then we talked about messiness, each person shared their own opinion
[14:10:00] <gehsekky> that is just bad form when requesting help

[14:10:42] <gehsekky> maybe someone else will help
[14:10:54] <shoky> how the hell was i bashing your code?
[14:11:02] <shoky> you're the one who said it was problematic to begin with

[14:23:29] <supsup> which owuld make it pointless

[14:30:10] <aaronmcadam> ender is starting to be picked up a bit more too
[14:30:28] <aaronmcadam> it's still a non-standarised ting
[14:30:39] <luas6311> ciao
[14:30:44] <aaronmcadam> s/ting/thing
[14:30:45] <luas6311> !list
[14:32:43] <gaius65> How can I get the type ('div','li','a',etc.) of my current $(el)?
[14:35:58] <hampsterblade> Is there an easy way to put a variable in a regex expression?
[14:36:10] <hampsterblade> I have this regex var regex= /(search_string[a-z0-9]*)/i  and search_string is a variable
[14:36:15] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[14:36:20] <aaronmcadam> use the RegEx object
[14:36:34] <rickibalboa> gaius65, $(el).prop('tagName');
[14:37:05] <aaronmcadam> hampsterblade:   var regex = ['^', codePrefix, '[a-z0-9]+$'].join('');
[14:37:06] <aaronmcadam>   return value.length === codeLength && new RegExp( regex, 'i' ).test(value);
[14:37:36] <hampsterblade> Thank you so much, been trying to figure this one out for a while
[14:37:41] <aaronmcadam> np
[14:37:54] <aaronmcadam> the only valid reason for using a new Object I've found, apart from image preloading
[14:38:30] <hampsterblade> This function scares me in all honesty
[14:38:37] <aaronmcadam> what function?
[14:38:38] <hampsterblade> Hate string matching in a $.each loop
[14:38:46] <gaius65> rickibalboa: that works cross-browser?
[14:39:11] <hampsterblade> This might help
[14:39:18] <rickibalboa> If it's in jQuery it will yeah
[14:39:22] <aaronmcadam> hampsterblade: have you tried using .filter instead?
[14:39:38] <hampsterblade> this is what I'm working with http://pastebin.com/7xXpkskn
[14:39:55] <rickibalboa> It just references element.tagName, I think.
[14:40:08] <hampsterblade> I want to add any strings that match any characters of the first word to an array, and then move any exact matches to the top
[14:41:08] <hampsterblade> what does .filter do?
[14:41:22] <aaronmcadam> well that will just filter dom objects
[14:41:28] <hampsterblade> oh no, filter would be a bad idea
[14:41:28] <aaronmcadam> ?filter @ hampsterblade
[14:41:29] <bot-t> hampsterblade, .filter(selector): Reduce the set of matched elements to those that match the selector or pass the function's test. http://api.jquery.com/filter/
[14:41:36] <hampsterblade> I'm working with a huge array
[14:41:52] <aaronmcadam> well a nested for loop with regexs is gonna be pretty bad
[14:41:52] <hampsterblade> about 2MB multidementional array
[14:41:58] <aaronmcadam> holy jesus christ
[14:42:11] <hampsterblade> a lot of data I'm workng with
[14:42:19] <aaronmcadam> is this from an API?
[14:42:25] <hampsterblade> yes
[14:42:32] <aaronmcadam> with no control from you?
[14:42:38] <hampsterblade> very little
[14:42:44] <aaronmcadam> you should be using a middleware
[14:42:45] <hampsterblade> I converted the xml to json, that's about it
[14:42:49] <hampsterblade> php
[14:42:52] <aaronmcadam> manipulate it in the php then
[14:42:58] <hampsterblade> but I need some basic searching with json
[14:43:00] <aaronmcadam> it will be way faster to do that before u do it
[14:43:30] <hampsterblade> http://jcon.mhamptontech.com/anidbcache.php?list=true  this is the array I'm searching, trying to return the ids
[14:43:51] <aaronmcadam> and there's no other params you can pass to do that?
[14:44:18] <hampsterblade> Basically I type in the title, I want to pull the closest match and get the index
[14:44:32] <aaronmcadam> have u not tried YQL too, it's got some useful stuff to filter data
[14:45:07] <hampsterblade> I know I can do this in php
[14:45:09] <aaronmcadam> it will transliterate to json from xml too
[14:45:17] <hampsterblade> But I want to avoid large amounts of ajax calls
[14:45:34] <aaronmcadam> depends where it makes sense to put the load
[14:46:12] <aaronmcadam> it's probably much more wise to use ajax calls rather than searching such a huge set
[14:46:21] <aaronmcadam> and doing regexs on every single string
[14:46:44] <aaronmcadam> and looping twice over each one row?
[14:47:20] <aaronmcadam> you're gonna have to do a bit more manipulation to remove that initial loop at least
[14:48:31] <hampsterblade> The initial loop is because it's two dementional
[14:48:46] <hampsterblade> Each item has multiple titles
[14:49:05] <hampsterblade> in diferent languages
[14:49:10] <aaronmcadam> heh
[14:49:11] <hampsterblade> Most of them will be escaped later
[14:49:15] <aaronmcadam> what's it performing like at the moment
[14:49:24] <hampsterblade> Right now it's not doing anything
[14:49:34] <hampsterblade> because I haven't got it working yet
[14:49:51] <hampsterblade> Still returning null on stuff it shouldn't
[14:50:19] <Faryshta_> Is there an event for when a click is over?
[14:51:11] <hampsterblade> .onMouseUp
[14:51:38] <aaronmcadam> mouseout
[14:51:39] <Faryshta_> hampsterblade: let me check thanks.
[14:51:39] <aaronmcadam> oh
[14:51:42] <aaronmcadam> a click
[14:51:50] <Faryshta_> aaronmcadam: no, that wont work.
[14:51:54] <aaronmcadam> you might wanna check browser support for that
[14:51:55] <hampsterblade> http://api.jquery.com/mouseup/
[14:52:00] <aaronmcadam> cool
[14:52:05] <aaronmcadam> never had the need for it
[14:54:52] <hampsterblade> Still working on it, about got it figured out
[14:55:56] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[14:55:58] <hampsterblade> shoot
[14:56:06] <aaronmcadam> at least show a loading indicator, yeah?
[14:56:11] <hampsterblade> it says to use return false to break a each loop
[14:56:13] <aaronmcadam> "this is gonna take a while..."
[14:56:21] <hampsterblade> That won't break out of my function right?
[14:56:44] <aaronmcadam> that will break out of the iteration yeah
[14:56:50] <hampsterblade> ok
[14:56:59] <aaronmcadam> i.e. stop looping
[14:57:11] <hampsterblade> I was afraid to use it in fear of breaking out of the first loop
[14:57:16] <aaronmcadam> shouldn't
[14:57:30] <aaronmcadam> I would use real for loops in this instance
[14:57:41] <aaronmcadam> perf is gonna kill you here
[14:57:47] <Faryshta_> Is this syntax ok? $(".something").css('background-image','image.png');
[14:57:47] <hampsterblade> I'm aware
[14:58:07] <hampsterblade> I'll move it to a worker thread too, and set some caps to try and optimize things
[14:58:25] <aaronmcadam> oh this is for html5 browsers only?
[14:58:48] <hampsterblade> yes
[14:59:00] <gotenks_ssj6> NoiseEee: hi
[14:59:00] <aaronmcadam> as long as your client knows that then hehe
[14:59:10] <hampsterblade> They are aware
[14:59:15] <gotenks_ssj6> http://pastebin.com/sRhx7CSq
[14:59:17] <hampsterblade> I've basically said fuck IE6 from the beginning
[14:59:21] <hampsterblade> I'm using jStorage lol
[14:59:32] <aaronmcadam> what about 7,8 and 9?
[15:01:33] <DerekPioneer> is there a plugin for something like amazon's recommended products. where there's four or five images in a row and then arrows on either side, and you can click next or previous and rotate through the image set
[15:02:14] <aaronmcadam> you mean like jCarousel DerekPioneer
[15:02:20] <aaronmcadam> jCarousel lite is ok
[15:02:54] <aaronmcadam> DerekPioneer: http://www.gmarwaha.com/jquery/jcarousellite/
[15:02:58] <gotenks_ssj6> someone can check if this is right?
[15:04:48] <suedoh> hi all, what is the recommended data to give back to the browser on ajax posts?
[15:04:52] <suedoh> is it safe to JSON?
[15:05:09] <aaronmcadam> json is the best yeah
[15:05:21] <aaronmcadam> ?getJSON @ suedoh
[15:05:22] <bot-t> suedoh, jQuery.getJSON(url, [data], [success]): Load JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.getJSON/
[15:05:36] <aaronmcadam> oh, you mean POSTing
[15:05:49] <aaronmcadam> yeah just specify dataType as "json"
[15:05:57] <aaronmcadam> in your $.ajax
[15:06:43] <suedoh> okay
[15:06:54] <suedoh> so it's safe to use JSON for both parsing and sending using jquery?
[15:07:03] <aaronmcadam> use json2.js
[15:07:13] <aaronmcadam> for actually stringifying
[15:07:22] <aaronmcadam> if it's not a form you're posting
[15:07:51] <suedoh> no it's form data that I'm going to be posting
[15:07:55] <aaronmcadam> otherwise simply .serialize() or .serializeArray() will work if you specify that as your data
[15:07:56] <hampsterblade> I have finished it!!!
[15:07:57] <hampsterblade> http://pastebin.com/cyPFymcM
[15:08:35] <aaronmcadam> suedoh: right so $( form ).serialize() in the data param will work
[15:08:45] <burlyscudd> question: I get some form data back from an AJAX call.  I need to change the names of the inputs.  When I try doing this in a helper method, the inputs aren't changed permanently in that chunk of HTML.  I think I'm not understanding something key about mutability w/ jQuery objects.  What am I missing here? https://gist.github.com/2295834  (apologies if you don't like CoffeeScript)
[15:08:45] <aaronmcadam> s/param/key
[15:10:23] <aaronmcadam> burlyscudd: of course, are you setting the right context here
[15:11:00] <burlyscudd> aaronmcadam: in what sense?  I'm hitting this method w/ AJAX (HTML) data from the success callback
[15:11:09] <aaronmcadam> right
[15:11:23] <burlyscudd> I thought that form_html would be mutated by the helper method and therefore when I return it back, it is the right proper altered stuff
[15:11:28] <aaronmcadam> you'll need to use replaceWith on the actual form
[15:11:43] <aaronmcadam> the callback is called in a different scope
[15:11:45] <aaronmcadam> so no
[15:11:50] <aaronmcadam> it will mutate the html
[15:11:58] <burlyscudd> aaronmcadam: this is a helper method that the callback calls on the data it receives
[15:12:00] <aaronmcadam> but if you don't actually add it to the dom, then nothing will happen
[15:12:10] <aaronmcadam> burlyscudd: I know that man
[15:12:24] <aaronmcadam> ?replaceWith @ burlyscudd
[15:12:24] <bot-t> burlyscudd, .replaceWith(newContent): Replace each element in the set of matched elements with the provided new content. http://api.jquery.com/replaceWith/
[15:13:01] <burlyscudd> aaronmcadam: so that's instead of the attr.('name', newName)?
[15:13:04] <aaronmcadam> I've done something very similar myself lately
[15:13:39] <aaronmcadam> what's that last line?
[15:13:55] <aaronmcadam> ah it's a return?
[15:14:08] <burlyscudd> aaronmcadam: yeah I'm returning $(form_html) â€” which isn't altered
[15:14:11] <aaronmcadam> not the most idiomatic part of coffeescript
[15:14:22] <burlyscudd> yeah it's showing its ruby background there imo
[15:14:25] <aaronmcadam> what's the point in returning it
[15:14:49] <aaronmcadam> what happens if u log out that call
[15:14:54] <aaronmcadam> do u get back the mutated html?
[15:14:55] <pifantastic> burlyscudd: save $(form_html) to avariable and then return it
[15:15:05] <pifantastic> you are basically recreating a jQuery with that last object
[15:15:11] <pifantastic> jQuery object*
[15:15:21] <aaronmcadam> ah good catcg
[15:15:22] <burlyscudd> aaronmcadam: yeah if you log it you see the original stuff
[15:15:23] <aaronmcadam> ah good catch
[15:15:51] <aaronmcadam> you don't need to return anything anyway if the method actually does what it says
[15:15:55] <pifantastic> burlyscudd: https://gist.github.com/2295860
[15:16:10] <kitikonti> i have a problem with my selfmade slider. the slider should fadeOut the front image so that i could see the image in the back. after this i want to remove the old image from the dom.
[15:16:23] <burlyscudd> aaronmcadam: yeah I do â€” I append result of method call
[15:16:35] <aaronmcadam> well then your method is named incorrectly
[15:17:08] <pifantastic> burlyscudd: in your case, when you pass a string of HTML to $(), jQuery creates a document fragment.
[15:17:09] <aaronmcadam> all that's doing is apparently mutating a set of dom nodes that aren't part of the dom of the page
[15:17:22] <pifantastic> burlyscudd: it does not modify the string you pass to it
[15:18:01] <burlyscudd> pifantastic: ok I thouhgt I was creating a doc fragment, mod'ing it, and then passing back mod'd fragment
[15:18:05] <burlyscudd> does that make sense?
[15:18:18] <pifantastic> you were making an entirely new document fragment with the last line of your function
[15:18:21] <aaronmcadam> https://gist.github.com/2295871
[15:18:52] <burlyscudd> pifantastic: that makes sense. cloning doc frag doesn't seem to work tho
[15:19:06] <pifantastic> burlyscudd: does this not work? https://gist.github.com/2295860
[15:19:08] <aaronmcadam> burlyscudd: https://gist.github.com/2295871
[15:19:22] <burlyscudd> aaronmcadam: sorry â€” I'm not having any problem at all appending form data to the DOM where I want itâ€¦ :-)
[15:19:30] <pifantastic> burlyscudd: right
[15:19:31] <pifantastic> I get that
[15:19:33] <aaronmcadam> kk
[15:19:41] <burlyscudd> pifantastic: yeah just tried that â€” exact same prob
[15:19:43] <burlyscudd> lemme sanity check
[15:19:45] <pifantastic> you are trying to modify the HTML you are getting back from an Ajax call
[15:19:55] <burlyscudd> yes
[15:20:23] <pifantastic> So resetInputsForForm needs to return the actual jQuery object that it modified
[15:20:35] <pifantastic> in your case you were creating a new one as the last line
[15:20:38] <burlyscudd> pifantastic: yes exactly
[15:20:45] <pifantastic> and that will not work
[15:20:48] <burlyscudd> right i get why that was a fuckup
[15:20:52] <burlyscudd> totally on board
[15:20:54] <pifantastic> okay
[15:21:15] <pifantastic> So now, are you taking the jQuery object that is the result of resetInputsForForm and using that to append to the dom?
[15:21:23] <pifantastic> or are you just resuing the form_html string again?
[15:21:28] <pifantastic> reusing*
[15:21:48] <burlyscudd> heh I'm appending result of call
[15:22:10] <hampsterblade> script doesn't work at all :(
[15:22:16] <aaronmcadam> haha
[15:22:24] <aaronmcadam> u just said it did
[15:22:30] <hampsterblade> no clue where it's breaking
[15:22:42] <aaronmcadam> are u resetting your regex on each iteration
[15:22:57] <hampsterblade> don't need to
[15:23:04] <aaronmcadam> if u say so
[15:23:23] <burlyscudd> pifantastic: thanks â€” I got it working.  I did have a regression from a git merge earlier that screwed meâ€¦ :-)
[15:23:33] <pifantastic> ;)
[15:23:34] <hampsterblade> it's my second function that's not working lol
[15:23:43] <hampsterblade> oh i know what it is
[15:23:46] <hampsterblade> need a parse int
[15:24:38] <aaronmcadam> or a lovely unary operator
[15:24:43] <aaronmcadam> ;)
[15:24:53] <javajosh> hi there, can someone help me with a problem? I'm not sure if it's jquery or jquery mobile, but my slider won't move when I update the input value. http://jsfiddle.net/javajosh/vaP4r/
[15:24:54] <hampsterblade> you're right lol
[15:24:56] <aaronmcadam> ?eval +"1"
[15:24:59] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: 1
[15:25:20] <hampsterblade> does ++var work in javascript?
[15:25:21] <aaronmcadam> I never use parseInt unless it's user entered
[15:25:35] <javajosh> ?eval ++1
[15:25:35] <bot-t> javajosh: SyntaxError: invalid increment operand
[15:25:41] <aaronmcadam> you mean incrementing?

[15:25:45] <bot-t> pifantastic: 2
[15:25:45] <aaronmcadam> or is that something else?
[15:25:48] <hampsterblade> preincrement
[15:25:54] <javajosh> ?eval 1++
[15:25:55] <bot-t> javajosh: SyntaxError: invalid increment operand
[15:25:58] <hampsterblade> results[counter] = index+1;  isn't working
[15:26:03] <pifantastic> cannot increment a scalar
[15:26:11] <hampsterblade> when I get 0 its making it 01 instead of 1
[15:26:15] <javajosh> ?eval var a = 1 ; a++;
[15:26:16] <bot-t> javajosh: 1
[15:26:16] <aaronmcadam> wtf
[15:26:23] <pifantastic> hampsterblade: because it is a string
[15:26:23] <aaronmcadam> +index + 1
[15:26:27] <blindMoe> hampsterblade: type cast
[15:26:28] <sirecote> ?eval (1)++
[15:26:28] <bot-t> sirecote: SyntaxError: invalid increment operand
[15:26:43] <pifantastic> hampsterblade: results[counter] = 1 + index;
[15:27:04] <pifantastic> jesus christ, everyone stop trying to increment scalars
[15:27:09] <hampsterblade> results[counter] = parseInt(index)+1;  did that
[15:27:18] <aaronmcadam> you don't need parseInt there tho
[15:27:21] <Eviltwin> ?eval 1..toFixed(12)
[15:27:22] <bot-t> Eviltwin: "1.000000000000"
[15:27:22] <aaronmcadam> just fuckin +
[15:27:27] <hampsterblade> didn't work
[15:27:29] <javajosh> haha. when everyone gets bored torturing the bot, maybe you can look at my problem: http://jsfiddle.net/javajosh/vaP4r/
[15:27:33] <hampsterblade> treated it as a string
[15:27:36] <aaronmcadam> you're doing it wrong then :D
[15:27:57] <aaronmcadam> ?eval var index = "0"; +index + 1
[15:27:57] <bot-t> aaronmcadam: 1
[15:28:00] <aaronmcadam> seeeeee
[15:28:10] <hampsterblade> Search is working
[15:28:13] <aaronmcadam> that's why i said *unary*
[15:28:20] <hampsterblade> and pretty fast thanks to setting the limit on it
[15:28:26] <pifantastic> javajosh: what is the problem?
[15:28:27] <hampsterblade> feels natural
[15:28:27] <aaronmcadam> kk
[15:28:36] <pifantastic> multiplying any number by 1 will always return the same number
[15:28:41] <pifantastic> math is king of awesome that way
[15:28:44] <pifantastic> kind*
[15:28:54] <hampsterblade> +index what does that do?
[15:29:06] <aaronmcadam> ?g unary operator @ hampsterblade
[15:29:07] <bot-t> hampsterblade, Unary operation - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unary_operation
[15:29:12] <pifantastic> ?eval var index = 1; +index;
[15:29:13] <bot-t> pifantastic: 1
[15:29:21] <hampsterblade> That works
[15:29:22] <aaronmcadam> that's redudant
[15:29:33] <aaronmcadam> it's already a number
[15:29:40] <javajosh> pifantastic: slider not updating when value is changed: http://jsfiddle.net/javajosh/vaP4r/
[15:30:00] <aaronmcadam> it just casts to number without actually parsing, it's useful when you know the string will actually only be a number
[15:30:33] <pifantastic> javajosh: http://jquerymobile.com/demos/1.1.0-rc.1/docs/forms/slider/methods.html
[15:31:15] <pifantastic> javajosh: http://jsfiddle.net/pKysR/1/

[15:32:33] <pifantastic> yup
[15:32:36] <pifantastic> good joorb
[15:32:44] <hampsterblade> weird
[15:32:56] <hampsterblade> when I call it like this 	var value= $.anidb.search_title($('#animetitle').val(), 10);
[15:32:56] <hampsterblade> 	$('#anime').html($.anidb.get_title(value[0]));  it doesn't work
[15:32:58] <pifantastic> javajosh: get used to that if you're using jquery mobile
[15:33:07] <hampsterblade> 	var value= $.anidb.search_title($('#animetitle').val(), 10);
[15:33:07] <hampsterblade> 	alert(value[0]);
[15:33:07] <hampsterblade> 	alert($.anidb.get_title(value[0]));  when I call it like this it doesn't

[15:35:34] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Seriously, Just Make a JSFiddle | CSS-Tricks - http://css-tricks.com/seriously-just-make-a-jsfiddle/
[15:35:38] <aaronmcadam> there u go
[15:38:53] <hampsterblade> I figured it out
[15:39:00] <hampsterblade> Just got a few tweaks on another script
[15:42:59] <gotenks_ssj6> thia is right ========> var username = '<?php echo $username?>'; ?
[15:43:31] <shoky> gotenks_ssj6 maybe
[15:44:17] <hye> anyone falmiliar with ajax error c00ce514 ? when trying to get an image?
[15:44:55] <shoky> we will be if you fiddle it up
[15:45:35] <hye> how about i fiddle your ass
[15:45:40] <pifantastic> shoky: let's not use the f workd please
[15:46:09] <aaronmcadam> what? fiddle?
[15:46:09] <pifantastic> also, hye, seriously, we cannot help you if we cant see the code. That error code is probably coming from whatever server you are making requests to.
[15:46:38] <aaronmcadam> somebody's looking for a ban
[15:47:08] <shoky> say what
[15:47:11] <aaronmcadam> you guys know how to stub an ajax request right
[15:47:20] <aaronmcadam> on jsfiddle and jsbin?
[15:47:26] <aaronmcadam> shoky: talking about hye
[15:47:27] <hye> pifantastic i said anyone falmiliar, I didnt say, jump out and help me if you dont got a clue
[15:47:51] <shoky> the issue is what you said afterwards
[15:47:55] <aaronmcadam> the answer is no, that's non-standard
[15:48:05] <pifantastic> Why would anyone have a clue about a 7 character code
[15:48:08] <VernonK> hye: Check this out.  Answer your ?  http://nevyan.blogspot.com/2008/12/easy-solve-ajax-c00ce514-error.html
[15:48:17] <shoky> look, someone googled for you
[15:48:24] <pifantastic> :D
[15:48:28] <hye> VernonK thanks i appreciate it, but thats the first place i looked
[15:48:37] <hye> it doesnt help, i have the correct content types  set already
[15:48:43] <hye> image/jpeg
[15:48:48] <shoky> maybe you dont
[15:49:10] <aaronmcadam> is it a jpg?
[15:49:13] <aaronmcadam> or a jpeg?
[15:49:25] <aaronmcadam> wonder if the mimetype is being awkward
[15:49:28] <hye> a jpeg
[15:50:00] <hye> a jpeg and jpg have same mime type if i am not mistaken
[15:50:12] <pifantastic> why are you making an Ajax request for an image?
[15:50:24] <pifantastic> <img src="BOOM" />
[15:50:40] <hye> because i am dynamically resizing images on the fly
[15:50:51] <pifantastic> And?
[15:50:58] <aaronmcadam> is it an nginx/apache issue?
[15:50:59] <hye> and i grab them back using ajax
[15:50:59] <pifantastic> that does not need to be an Ajax request
[15:51:07] <gf3> hye: that's silly
[15:51:08] <pifantastic> load it as an img src
[15:51:08] <aaronmcadam> not if he's actually processing them
[15:51:17] <hye> well i am using jquery colorbox for this project, and it uses ajax to grab the images
[15:51:40] <pifantastic> that makes no sense
[15:51:51] <pifantastic> browsers solved image loading a long time ago
[15:51:54] <pifantastic> and it's called src
[15:52:05] <aaronmcadam> i don't think this is as simple as u think
[15:52:15] <aaronmcadam> hye, are the img sources in json or something?
[15:52:23] <shoky> o.O
[15:52:31] <pifantastic> Not if he is setting a jpeg header for the response
[15:52:47] <hye> the images are stored on local file system. I use an asp.net module to resize the images on the fly (in essence serving up a smaller file size for clients, because the originals are high def)
[15:52:57] <pifantastic> right
[15:52:59] <pifantastic> that part makes sense
[15:53:24] <pifantastic> Any HTTP response that sets an image header can be handled by an <img> tag
[15:53:36] <aaronmcadam> so manipulate the src
[15:53:38] <aaronmcadam> of course
[15:53:51] <gf3> or new Image
[15:53:53] <pifantastic> var img = new Image(); img.src = "http://whatever.the.hell/lolz";
[15:53:54] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:53:59] <hye> so for example it would be http://www.&.com/thumbnail.aspx?file=one.jpg&width=550  That would return one.jpg with the new width dynamically.
[15:54:10] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[15:54:16] <aaronmcadam> if u just set that as the src
[15:54:17] <pifantastic> So just create a new image, and set that as the src
[15:54:18] <aaronmcadam> that will do
[15:54:26] <hye> setting it as the SRC works
[15:54:29] <aaronmcadam> no need for ajax at all
[15:55:07] <hye> but when it set that as the link url surrounding the <img> so the user can click and see a bigger one. i get that ajax error.  keep in mind i am using "colorbox" image gallery script and that is the script that generates the error
[15:55:19] <hye> when i access the files without ajax, obviously it works even using the dynamic url
[15:55:52] <hye> Request unsuccessful: Error: Could not complete the operation due to error c00ce514.
[15:56:16] <aaronmcadam> right
[15:57:30] <eggsby> hmm, I thought that .on watched for new dom nodes
[15:57:38] <eggsby> so every time I have to render I have to reattach my events?
[15:57:40] <shoky> depends how you use it
[15:57:50] <aaronmcadam> that's not true
[15:58:04] <aaronmcadam> yeah it does depend on the parameters you pass it
[15:58:29] <aaronmcadam> sorry thought you were another person looking for a dom polling event againb
[15:58:34] <aaronmcadam> s/b//
[15:58:47] <fission6> is there a way to lock out  / grey out all elements but a specific div, to allow the user to focus on data input? kind of like a modal but nothing pop ups just locks out all other elements
[15:59:10] <aaronmcadam> there was a beta plugin for that
[15:59:10] <eggsby> shoky: in what sense
[15:59:20] <eggsby> I attach events to dom nodes that don't exist yet, then create them after a user event
[15:59:28] <aaronmcadam> wasn't convinced on the ux of it tho
[15:59:29] <eggsby> and the new dom nodes get no events
[15:59:31] <hye> alright guys got it to work
[15:59:32] <fission6> aaronmcadam: was that to me
[15:59:36] <aaronmcadam> yes
[15:59:38] <shoky> eggsby, how are you calling .on
[15:59:52] <shoky> you can't attach events to dom nodes that don't exist
[15:59:54] <hye> based on colorbox docs it has a paramter caled 'photo' I set it to true. excerpt: "If true, this setting forces ColorBox to display a link as a photo. Use this when automatic photo detection fails (such as using a url like 'photo.php' instead of 'photo.jpg')"
[16:00:00] <eggsby> $('some yet to be created selection').on('whatever')
[16:00:02] <hye> thanks for your assistance
[16:00:10] <eggsby> oh shoky, how should I do it instead? Isn't that on 'live' worked?
[16:00:20] <aaronmcadam> that's not how you use it for that usecase eggsby
[16:00:39] <aaronmcadam> $( context ).on ( event, target, callback )
[16:00:40] <shoky> eggsby, you need to delegate the events to some container element
[16:00:43] <aaronmcadam> that will work
[16:00:55] <shoky> yeah, 'target' being the 'container element'
[16:00:59] <shoky> er sorry
[16:01:01] <shoky> context
[16:01:02] <shoky> :)
[16:01:14] <aaronmcadam> you're getting confused yourself
[16:01:24] <aaronmcadam> ah yeah :D
[16:01:31] <aaronmcadam> u threw me off haha
[16:01:34] <eggsby> so $('my-rendering-fixture').on('click', cb) ?
[16:01:34] <shoky> just typo ;)
[16:01:43] <fission6> i was thinking there was a quick way to do this
[16:01:47] <shoky> eggsby no
[16:01:49] <aaronmcadam> no eggsby, one more
[16:02:00] <eggsby> target being the thing I actually wanted to attach to?
[16:02:04] <shoky> $('my-container-whatever').on('click', '.myButtonClass', callback)
[16:02:11] <eggsby> oh, ok
[16:02:12] <eggsby> ty
[16:02:16] <shoky> if you want to get all clicks for myButtonClass buttons
[16:02:19] <shoky> np
[16:02:39] <aaronmcadam> now the important bit, do u understand why eggsby
[16:02:42] <raj> damn shoky, holding down #jquery
[16:02:45] <raj> :)
[16:02:48] <shoky> lol rajy ;)
[16:02:55] <shoky> #jquery is holding me down actually
[16:03:03] <shoky> some people are so rude :\
[16:03:14] <raj> seriously?
[16:03:17] <eggsby> aaronmcadam: vaguely
[16:03:19] <aaronmcadam> everyone
[16:03:26] <shoky> seems that way to me at least
[16:03:29] <raj> why be rude to the hand that feeds you?
[16:03:31] <eggsby> I figure it's just another level of specificity
[16:03:42] <aaronmcadam> a lot of the guys that come through here are pricks
[16:03:48] <shoky> rajy is the best just so you all know.
[16:04:01] <raj> raj even
[16:04:04] <raj> haha
[16:04:04] <aaronmcadam> it's fundamentally different eggsby, event delegation over binding
[16:04:18] <shoky> if im shoky ur rajy
[16:04:22] <shoky> only way it makes sense.
[16:04:33] <aaronmcadam> does he have an entry on the bot?
[16:04:41] <aaronmcadam> ?aaronmcadam ;)
[16:04:42] <bot-t> aaronmcadam, Couldn't find "aaronmcadam ;)" in jQuery Docs.
[16:04:43] <shoky> people have entries?
[16:04:44] <shoky> heh
[16:04:45] <aaronmcadam> ?aaronmcadam
[16:04:45] <bot-t> the crazy irish man
[16:04:49] <shoky> raj++
[16:04:53] <aaronmcadam> yes
[16:05:08] <aaronmcadam> only for the actual shogun masters making baby ninjas
[16:05:14] <fission6> i would htink i could do this with straight jquery, basically grey out all divs but the one i want the user to focus on
[16:05:14] <shoky> ?Eviltwin
[16:05:15] <bot-t> shoky, #10183 (Strange results for getting height of hidden div.) – jQuery ... - Opened 7 months ago http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/10183
[16:05:21] <shoky> er nice....
[16:05:25] <aaronmcadam> fission6: yeah u could
[16:05:45] <aaronmcadam> shoky: at least you file tickets!
[16:05:46] <raj> anyone ever use history.js? I don't understand what the Title is?
[16:05:53] <shoky> me??
[16:06:06] <fission6> aaronmcadam: well how!
[16:06:10] <aaronmcadam> haha
[16:06:10] <shoky> history.js sounds boring!
[16:06:13] <aaronmcadam> parents
[16:06:13] <raj> also don't know why you need data and url
[16:06:17] <raj> they seem redundant
[16:06:29] <aaronmcadam> look at the pushState API then
[16:06:38] <aaronmcadam> and then u might find out the why
[16:07:59] <raj> aaronmcadam, all it says is--> Pushes a new state to the browser; data can be null or an object, title can be null or a string, url must be a string
[16:08:52] <aaronmcadam> all what says?
[16:09:07] <aaronmcadam> I'm willing to bet there's more in the spec than that
[16:09:49] <raj> aaronmcadam, I'm looking at https://github.com/balupton/History.js/#readme
[16:09:56] <aaronmcadam> kk
[16:10:01] <raj> it says Exposed API at the bottom
[16:10:06] <raj> ...well, towards the bottom
[16:10:12] <aaronmcadam> I'll take ur word for it
[16:10:16] <raj> k
[16:10:25] <raj> so why do I need data and url?
[16:10:28] <aaronmcadam> I meant he w3c spec
[16:10:31] <aaronmcadam> the*
[16:10:38] <aaronmcadam> ask the guy who wrote it
[16:10:50] <aaronmcadam> file an issue, guess, ask random people on irc
[16:10:52] <aaronmcadam> shit
[16:11:00] <aaronmcadam> you've done 2 out of 3 there so...
[16:11:10] <raj> i've done 3/3 actually
[16:11:20] <raj> well, not completed asking him
[16:11:30] <aaronmcadam> righty
[16:11:40] <aaronmcadam> you've got sense then :)
[16:11:51] <raj> so, since u know how to use it....
[16:11:58] <aaronmcadam> when did I say that
[16:12:14] <raj> oh, then how are you suggesting the pushState api?
[16:12:30] <aaronmcadam> right
[16:12:39] <aaronmcadam> I would try to find out about the pushState SPEC
[16:12:44] <aaronmcadam> not the shim that is history.js
[16:12:54] <aaronmcadam> as a last resoirt
[16:13:10] <aaronmcadam> otherwise I'd just fill in the defaults it wants and forget about it until the maintainer got back to me
[16:13:37] <haizum> can someone take a look at this page: http://ex.fm/javascript-api#scripttag and tell me how the hell to incorporate the exfmSongsAsyncEvent event to my dynamically loading pages via infinite scroll?
[16:14:12] <haizum> sorry, make that simply http://ex.fm/javascript-api
[16:14:31] <raj> it would be really nice if bbq did what history.js can do
[16:14:32] <haizum> i've been told its possible, but have not had success thus far
[16:14:42] <aaronmcadam> fuck my wifi, trying to test
[16:14:58] <aaronmcadam> iphone won't connect to it, android is tho :S
[16:15:13] <haizum> i.e where do i include the exfmSongsAsyncEvent in the code
[16:15:25] <aaronmcadam> raj: 2 different things but yeh
[16:15:38] <aaronmcadam> not sure ben is really working on bbq much
[16:15:57] <shoky> haizum, in what code?
[16:16:50] <raj> aaronmcadam, is jquery query object plugin a better alternative
[16:16:53] <raj> ?
[16:16:56] <aaronmcadam> you'll want json2.js for IE parse
[16:17:02] <aaronmcadam> otherwise use parseJSON
[16:17:08] <haizum> my problem is that the player only picks up on the first page of mp3 links, and when infinite scroll loads the next page dynamically, i need the player to re-scan and update the playlist queue
[16:17:19] <aaronmcadam> raj: never seen that plugin before
[16:17:27] <haizum> shoky: my wordpress theme's js code
[16:17:41] <shoky> haizum, then call it after the next page is loaded..
[16:17:41] <raj> aaronmcadam, why do i need to parse it separately for IE?
[16:17:52] <aaronmcadam> I was talking to this haizum guy
[16:18:12] <aaronmcadam> because that API's code examples use native the JSON object
[16:18:13] <shoky> raj why do you bother to ask that q :)
[16:18:19] <aaronmcadam> only present in newer browsers
[16:18:36] <aaronmcadam> > ie8
[16:18:48] <haizum> aaronmcadam: i'm not too worried about that at the moment, i use the latest version of chrome which i'm sure supports it, just want functionality at this point
[16:19:08] <aaronmcadam> ...
[16:19:15] <aaronmcadam> I don't know why I bother
[16:19:20] <raj> why not just use JSON.parse?
[16:19:35] <aaronmcadam> if you don't care about ie7 then nevermind
[16:19:46] <haizum> i dont
[16:19:50] <raj>  oh, yeah, nevermind them
[16:19:51] <aaronmcadam> I develop apps for the real world sorry guys
[16:19:58] <raj> IE8 is the last one I'm caring to support
[16:20:09] <aaronmcadam> your clients must love you then
[16:20:10] <raj> u mean earliest
[16:20:11] <shoky> plenty of ie8 out and about
[16:20:15] <haizum> ditto
[16:20:21] <blindMoe> tons of ie7 users still out there
[16:20:24] <raj> *i mean earliest
[16:20:29] <haizum> raj: thats what the api uses, but i can't seem to get it to work
[16:20:30] <raj> blindMoe, what perecent?
[16:20:58] <shoky> haizum, how do you suggest we help you
[16:20:58] <haizum> i couldn't imagine anyone using ie7 unless you work in an office and your computers haven't been updated in a coon's age
[16:21:10] <aaronmcadam> wtf?
[16:21:14] <raj> is that racist?
[16:21:15] <blindMoe> raj: can't remember off the top of my head but I remember being suprised last time I looked... let me check
[16:21:16] <aaronmcadam> that's dodgy language
[16:21:26] <aaronmcadam> depends on your users
[16:21:34] <aaronmcadam> I have to deal with typical consumers
[16:21:35] <blindMoe> yeah definitely
[16:21:37] <someprimetime> does the chosen plugin have an option without a search box in it?
[16:21:39] <aaronmcadam> not very computer savvy
[16:21:45] <blindMoe> I support back to ie7
[16:21:50] <aaronmcadam> god man, just check yourself
[16:21:56] <aaronmcadam> yeah me too blindMoe
[16:22:02] <aaronmcadam> dropped ie6 last summer
[16:22:06] <blindMoe> most of our sites actually work on ie6 still
[16:22:26] <aaronmcadam> cool
[16:22:39] <aaronmcadam> how many average users do u have?
[16:22:49] <raj> 1 billion
[16:23:00] <aaronmcadam> haha ur an idiot :D
[16:23:15] <shoky> coons
[16:23:17] <aaronmcadam> haha!
[16:23:20] <raj> i'm sure some of them made duplicate accounts though
[16:23:22] <aaronmcadam> guys seriously
[16:23:36] <raj> so against the TOS
[16:23:49] <aaronmcadam> can't ever stop that tho
[16:24:02] <aaronmcadam> we did go down a line of identity management app
[16:24:05] <haizum> i just want to know how to codingly incorporate this exfmSongsAsyncEvent event to the api
[16:24:08] <aaronmcadam> but that got canned pretty quickly
[16:24:15] <shoky> codingly!!
[16:24:21] <haizum> not sure where to insert it
[16:24:30] <haizum> ya, analogism of the day
[16:24:31] <aaronmcadam> haizum what you're asking for is basically for us to write that for u
[16:24:37] <shoky> haizum, after the next page is loaded
[16:24:37] <haizum> uh no
[16:24:39] <shoky> i told you
[16:24:41] <haizum> it's already been written
[16:24:53] <aaronmcadam> it's more involved than just one line of code hah
[16:25:07] <aaronmcadam> doesn't that infinitescroll have a callback?
[16:25:14] <haizum> shoky: can you elaborate, you mean the listening and the dispatching code?
[16:25:18] <aaronmcadam> onNextPageLoad or something
[16:25:20] <haizum> yes it does
[16:25:22] <haizum> have a callback
[16:25:26] <shoky> you're the one that needs to elaborate son
[16:25:31] <aaronmcadam> hehe
[16:25:33] <aaronmcadam> "son" :D
[16:25:41] <aaronmcadam> patronisation++ :D
[16:25:51] <haizum> 1) infinite scroll has a callback i can execute code once the next page of content is loaded
[16:25:55] <shoky> mostly affection
[16:25:57] <aaronmcadam> bingo
[16:26:06] <aaronmcadam> what's your major malfunction then
[16:26:10] <shoky> 1) sounds like a super solution
[16:26:11] <haizum> but what code to execute, just the dispatching?
[16:26:15] <aaronmcadam> use getJSON to return the data
[16:26:32] <aaronmcadam> dispatching?
[16:26:40] <aaronmcadam> pub sub?! :D
[16:26:43] <haizum> http://ex.fm/javascript-api
[16:26:44] <aaronmcadam> yayyy pub sub
[16:26:49] <haizum> scroll to bottom
[16:26:54] <aaronmcadam> yeah pasting that link again is great
[16:26:56] <shoky> haizum, they show you how to dispatch their event
[16:27:06] <aaronmcadam> you mean trigger alright
[16:27:12] <shoky> no, dispatch
[16:27:19] <aaronmcadam> that's the same thing
[16:27:22] <aaronmcadam> dummy
[16:27:22] <haizum> fine
[16:27:30] <aaronmcadam> $( document ).trigger( eventName )
[16:27:31] <shoky> dispatchEvent()
[16:27:39] <aaronmcadam> I'm talking jquery idioms
[16:27:43] <shoky> his link is not
[16:27:44] <aaronmcadam> don't contradict me ;)
[16:27:51] <aaronmcadam> tehee
[16:28:21] <shoky> haizum, if you jsfiddle it, we can tell you.. where to plug it in, i guess
[16:29:00] <aaronmcadam> you're gonna have to stub it if it's ajax
[16:29:04] <aaronmcadam> stub the response
[16:29:22] <haizum> stub?
[16:29:24] <aaronmcadam> else you'll get lovely SOP issues

[16:31:32] <aaronmcadam> get the actual functionality working, then plug in the real data source
[16:31:34] <aaronmcadam> simple as fuck
[16:31:48] <aaronmcadam> that way we don't need to give a shit about the actual api you're using

[16:42:12] <innociv> Um wow
[16:42:12] <kitikonti> is there a way to not use 3 times children...
[16:42:16] <aaronmcadam> yeah
[16:42:21] <innociv> I'm getting an infinitely loop in firefox. No idea where to begin debugging that.
[16:42:23] <innociv> Since it freezes
[16:42:26] <innociv> and I cna't see the issue
[16:42:27] <aaronmcadam> just remove that initial .carousel
[16:43:04] <aaronmcadam> if you don't actually need that specificity, just $(gallery).find('ul) will do
[16:43:17] <kitikonti> ahhh with find
[16:44:30] <aaronmcadam> innociv are you using firebug?

[16:55:02] <Cameron_> what?
[16:55:12] <hacks> Why is it only using the last .gauge element? http://jsbin.com/uyoxuj/edit#javascript,html
[16:56:09] <aaronmcadam> that's enough for me night guys
[17:20:05] <raj> any history.js users in here wanna explain a couple concepts to me? such as why data AND url are needed?
[17:26:02] <coldhead> raj: i thought the point of that lib was to associate data with a particular url
[17:26:16] <coldhead> isn't like a key/val store?
[17:26:56] <LakWork> when I use $('.container').height() why isn't the height of images included?
[17:27:11] <LakWork> I have a div which contains an image and its height is not adding to the container height
[17:29:47] <LakWork> hey ajpiano
[17:30:08] <coldhead> LakWork: try giving the div a border
[17:30:13] <coldhead> so you can see where it actually is
[17:30:24] <coldhead> it may be that you have a floated image in a non-floated div
[17:30:33] <coldhead> and the div won't "contain" the image then
[17:30:48] <LakWork> so to clarify, i actually dont have a div. it's just an <img src=... />
[17:31:00] <LakWork> even when the image has fully loaded it is not factored into the height
[17:31:32] <LakWork> when i specify a height on the image with css, the calculation of height() is returned correctly
[17:32:00] <coldhead> that's very weird
[17:32:01] <smplstk> LakWork: images load after dom
[17:32:09] <smplstk> domready
[17:32:33] <westg> i wish there would be a massive revision to the DOM
[17:32:57] <LakWork> smplstk yes, but that doesn't seem to matter. even with the image loaded the height() is wrong
[17:33:14] <coldhead> maybe the image is cursed
[17:33:22] <coldhead> by gypsies
[17:33:48] <westg> ghosts
[17:38:48] <smplstk> LakWork: http://jsfiddle.net/serio/DxFQQ/
[17:46:43] <westg> what exactly is the MVC model?
[17:46:55] <westg> Is it just passing callbacks to all dependent events?
[17:46:59] <westg> and pub sub
[17:48:27] <smplstk> wat
[17:48:46] <westg> how does MVC apply to jQuery?
[17:48:50] <smplstk> ?lmgtfy mvc frameworks
[17:48:51] <bot-t> http://lmgtfy.com/?q=mvc+frameworks
[17:49:20] <westg> without frameworks
[17:49:28] <westg> what is the point of MVC
[17:49:44] <smplstk> separating concerns
[17:49:59] <smplstk> it's just a different methodology for building applications/projects
[17:50:12] <smplstk> vs putting all your codes in the same place
[17:50:38] <smplstk> jQuery is _not_ an example of MVC
[17:51:16] <westg> In that case I'm guessing all developers eventually reach the point at which manually separating and calling their code from different parts becomes a mess and that's when a framework is used?
[17:51:29] <westg> if they want to separate it ^
[17:51:55] <westg> is it kind of like modules in commonjs?
[17:52:02] <westg> with node.js
[17:52:37] <Hiero> ooh, ember.js looks like the best
[17:52:46] <Lonestar99> howdy folks
[17:57:53] <shoky> yay. just took some almost-nice very simple undo/redo plugin for jquery, and made it x100 more useful. especially for me. yay.
[17:58:27] <aJacom> jQuery('#colorselector a.lime').click(function() { jQuery('select#color').val("lime-green"); jQuery('select#color').change();	return false; }); <- Why isn't that working ?
[17:58:50] <lyrae> http://wordpress.bruce.devdynamic.com/ how do they make it so the background resizes with the window?
[17:59:07] <lyrae> i know there exists a plugin called backgroundStretcher, but theyre not using it
[17:59:19] <shoky> aJacom how are we supposed to tell?
[18:09:12] <jamookis> is there any reason to use one plugin scheme over another? $.myPlugin( "method", options ) like in the official plugin docs, or $.myPlugin.method( options ) like in http://jqueryboilerplate.com?
[18:10:05] <Eviltwin> How does the second know what instance it's referring to?
[18:10:08] <Eviltwin> Or is it a singleton?
[18:10:13] <Eviltwin> (Only one instance in the page)
[18:10:45] <fission6> how do i lock/grey out everything accept a single div, i want to focus the user on a portion of the site (a div) when they click a certain button
[18:10:51] <jamookis> oh sorry that should be $( "foo" ).myPlugin... in both cases
[18:11:11] <Eviltwin> Like $("foo").myPlugin.method( options ) ?
[18:11:43] <jamookis> yeah, vs $("foo").myPlugin("method", options), like how the plugin docs do it
[18:11:55] <Eviltwin> That second one doesn't really work
[18:12:09] <Eviltwin> At least I haven't seen it work well
[18:12:30] <fission6> Eviltwin: any ideas?
[18:12:42] <Eviltwin> fission6: I wasn't paying attention when you asked your question
[18:13:04] <jamookis> Eviltwin: http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring#Plugin_Methods is what i was using as a reference
[18:13:37] <derek___> i'm trying to get jcarousel to work, all i ever get is an error: "Cannot call method 'jcarousel' of null"
[18:13:45] <Eviltwin> I don't see anything that has a method signature like $("foo").myPlugin.method( options )
[18:13:46] <jamookis> care to explain why it doesn't work? i like the other way better i just have to know why the official docs do it that way
[18:14:18] <jamookis> no that page uses $("foo").myPlugin("method", options)
[18:14:18] <suedoh> Anyone see a problem with this:       var post_data = { 'action': 'REGISTER', 'domains[]': [], 'registrant[]': [] };       post_data.registrant['firstname'] = $('#firstname').val();
[18:14:24] <fission6> Eviltwin: i have a button on my web app and when a user clicks i show another div, i want to lock out / grey out everything and showing the new div only, sort of like a modal but the div is on the "page"
[18:14:27] <suedoh> I can't figure out why the assignment fails from the above code
[18:14:39] <jamookis> http://jqueryboilerplate.com/ uses $("foo").myPlugin.method(options)
[18:14:40] <Eviltwin> jamookis: Do you have an example like $("foo").myPlugin.method( options )?
[18:15:10] <gnarf> jamookis: that signature doesn't work
[18:15:25] <gnarf> there is a reason UI uses .plugin("method")
[18:16:10] <Eviltwin> jamookis: This looks like the $("#foo").plugin(option) signature to me
[18:16:11] <fission6> i want to suraface a div and "grey out" any other portion of the page
[18:16:34] <gnarf> You could potentially decorate a .myPlugin() to return a jQuery.sub() that has extended its "methods" onto it for .myPlugin().method( options )
[18:16:39] <blackwater> I have two conflicting jquery libraries. I need to import both for two separate features, but I am only able to use one or the other. Any help? I've searched the net.
[18:17:03] <suedoh> anyone know what's up with the JSON assignment I'm attempting above?
[18:17:06] <gnarf> blackwater: use the newer one, and update the library that wants the older one for the best use
[18:17:20] <jamookis> hmm, maybe i should just use the widget factory
[18:17:23] <suedoh> var post_data = { 'action': 'REGISTER', 'domains[]': [], 'registrant[]': [] };
[18:17:27] <suedoh> post_data.registrant['firstname'] = $('#firstname').val();
[18:17:37] <fission6> Eviltwin: something like this http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6626066/jquery-or-javascript-active-element-on-foreground-lock-background
[18:17:56] <Eviltwin> fission6: So not that?
[18:18:55] <fission6> i was wondering how to do it with jquery like lock the background and surface a div
[18:19:16] <suedoh> damn, i'm bashing my head against a wall here
[18:22:46] <suedoh> how is it possible to do  $("input:checked")  but also select the ones with a specific id=  attribute?
[18:23:13] <coldhead> $(':checked,#someid,#someotherid')
[18:23:28] <blackwater> gnarf: Thanks for the response.  What I am importing are custom jquery scripts, so I have no idea what is causing the conflict? I'm guessing the gQuery scripts have to call locally or remotely to the framework somehow correct?
[18:23:32] <suedoh> if my id is an array, it should work yes?
[18:23:52] <suedoh> <input type="checkbox" id="rD[]" />
[18:24:00] <coldhead> oh god don't do that
[18:24:01] <suedoh> $("input:checked, #rD").each(function() { });
[18:24:02] <gnarf> ?valid id
[18:24:02] <bot-t> ID attributes must begin with a letter ([A-Za-z]) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits ([0-9]), hyphens ("-"), underscores ("_"), colons (":"), and periods ("."). http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/types.html#h-6.2 - furthermore, IDs are unique, meaning only one element in the DOM can have a given ID at any time
[18:24:02] <suedoh> this is good?
[18:24:12] <gnarf> ^^^ suedoh IDs are UNIQUE
[18:24:19] <gnarf> thats a name="rD[]"
[18:24:21] <gnarf> probably
[18:24:23] <gnarf> in which case
[18:24:30] <suedoh> no, I put that in the id
[18:24:35] <suedoh> I should uncheck that I guess :)
[18:24:38] <suedoh> err, rename
[18:24:41] <gnarf> $("input[name='rd[]']:checked")
[18:24:54] <gnarf> suedoh: IDs are UNIQUE - two elements should not have the same ID
[18:25:09] <suedoh> so, if you have an array of checkboxes with unique values, the correct procedure is to use name="" instead of id=""
[18:25:10] <suedoh> ?
[18:25:15] <suedoh> gnarf, roger
[18:25:18] <suedoh> so name="" it is then
[18:26:00] <suedoh> man, i got lots of learning to do
[18:26:12] <suedoh> i've got another question if ya'll could please help
[18:26:19] <suedoh> var post_data = { 'action': 'REGISTER', 'domains[]': [], 'registrant[]': [] };
[18:26:24] <suedoh> post_data.registrant['firstname'] = $('#firstname').val();
[18:26:35] <suedoh> I'm trying to assign that way, but it fails.  Any idea what I'm doing wrong there?
[18:27:07] <suedoh> It says:  Cannot set property 'firstname' of undefined
[18:27:33] <gnarf> suedoh: arrays don't have arbitrary string keys, you probably want an object - also, the name of the key is "registrant[]" not registrant
[18:28:10] <suedoh> post_data.registrant['firstname']
[18:28:12] <suedoh> so that's wrong?
[18:28:24] <gnarf> post_data["registrant[]"]
[18:28:41] <suedoh> hrm
[18:28:50] <blackwater> gnarf: Is there any other work arounds?
[18:28:54] <gnarf> ?js test = []; test["however"] = "...."; JSON.stringify( test );
[18:28:56] <bot-t> gnarf: "[]"
[18:28:58] <suedoh> post_data["registrant["firstname"]"] = $(#firstname).val();
[18:29:02] <suedoh> so that's right ^ ?
[18:29:10] <gnarf> suedoh: thats even MORE wrong
[18:29:12] <gnarf> ?101 @suedoh
[18:29:12] <bot-t> suedoh, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html

[18:29:44] <suedoh> heh, okay
[18:29:52] <suedoh> i'm just working off examples here
[18:29:57] <suedoh> which is a bad idea
[18:29:59] <gnarf> ?js test = {}; test["however"] = "..."; JSON.stringify( test );
[18:29:59] <bot-t> gnarf: "{\"however\":\"...\"}"
[18:31:51] <Eviltwin> Silly associative arrays

[19:06:26] <JoeyA> Gotenks_ssj4: Unrelated to your question, but I would say: var username = '<?php echo json_encode($username); ?>';
[19:06:45] <JoeyA> err, drop the single quotes.
[19:06:54] <JoeyA> var username = <?php echo json_encode($username); ?>;
[19:07:05] <JoeyA> Otherwise, special characters in $username might fudge the JavaScript.
[19:08:05] <JoeyA> Gotenks_ssj4: Check your browser's error log.  I think there's a syntax error in the JavaScript.
[19:08:16] <JoeyA> url: <?php echo $username?>".html"  <- that doesn't look right.

[19:13:51] <JoeyA> (in particular, see if the attribute you're looking for appears).
[19:14:08] <Gotenks_ssj4> what is var_dump?
[19:14:45] <VioByte> Gotenks_ssj4: its the same as echo "<pre>"; print_r($_POST); echo "</pre>";

[19:23:41] <Gotenks_ssj4> no i am honest
[19:23:55] <VioByte> yea, like i said.. no offense.
[19:24:01] <VioByte> but its the internet after all
[19:24:05] <VioByte> :)
[19:24:08] <ipalaus_> there is anyway to make jQuery UI Selectable select a maximum of 3 items?
[19:24:11] <Gotenks_ssj4> sure
[19:24:27] <VioByte> whats in the username.html?
[19:24:42] <VioByte> Gotenks_ssj4: would it be a chat log?
[19:24:45] <Gotenks_ssj4> is the chatroom
[19:24:51] <Gotenks_ssj4> yes
[19:24:59] <VioByte> Gotenks_ssj4: ok
[19:25:02] <Gotenks_ssj4> is a adult cam
[19:25:04] <VioByte> Gotenks_ssj4: hold on
[19:25:05] <Gotenks_ssj4> chat
[19:25:52] <ipalaus_> ok, solved
[19:25:58] <Gotenks_ssj4> \o; 
[19:26:01] <Gotenks_ssj4> genius
[19:26:07] <chee> gnarf: does jquery have support for write only controls
[19:28:52] <whatthepoop> stupid question: I have a variable defined within the $(document).ready function, lets say 'foo': var foo = 'bar'; . how do I access foo in the console? what namespace does it reside in?
[19:30:27] <VioByte> Gotenks_ssj4: ugh.. you really need to learn how to layout your code better.
[19:30:43] <Gotenks_ssj4> [VioByte]: sory
[19:30:45] <Gotenks_ssj4> sorry
[19:30:55] <VioByte> Gotenks_ssj4: it's ok.. i use to be the same way
[19:31:31] <Gotenks_ssj4> jeje
[19:32:26] <VioByte> Gotenks_ssj4: Are you aware its trying to get .html from the server before i even pass it a username?
[19:33:36] <Gotenks_ssj4> ?
[19:34:04] <Gotenks_ssj4> i get the username before enterint the chat
[19:34:18] <Gotenks_ssj4> there is a page
[19:34:26] <Gotenks_ssj4> with a list of performers
[19:34:45] <Gotenks_ssj4> you click it, and the link send the username to the url
[19:47:41] <sharkmonkey> how would I have get the text in a text input selected?
[19:48:09] <JoeyA> .val()
[19:49:04] <sharkmonkey> Sorry I phrased that poorly.
[19:49:18] <sharkmonkey> How would I cause all the text to be selected/highlighted?
[19:50:42] <sharkmonkey> Like when you tab between inputs that already have text in them. All the text is pre-hilighted blue.
[19:50:53] <sharkmonkey> Making it easy to replace the text by just starting to type
[19:52:40] <sharkmonkey> I see why I was having trouble. I'm trying to do it before the text input is visible.
[19:52:51] <sharkmonkey> Once it's visible focus and select seem to hilight the text
[20:02:15] <Lonestar99> anyone what to try to debug a "empty string passed to getElementById()"  can't recreate it on jsfiddle....
[20:04:18] <Lonestar99> recreation on jsfiddle works, but not on live site...
[20:06:47] <Hawkee> Can somebody tell me why in Opera the nested contenteditable div here doesn't not present a cursor when clicked? http://jsfiddle.net/Hawkee/gSd2p/2/
[20:07:00] <Hawkee> does not.
[20:11:48] <Lonestar99> Hawkee: how do you get rounded edges on your button? is it an image?
[20:12:00] <Hawkee> external CSS
[20:12:07] <Hawkee> no image
[20:12:37] <Hawkee> I just embedded my site CSS to make it look nicer
[20:13:11] <Lonestar99> oh ok, is it cross browser compatible?  cuss i thought rounded boxes could only be done with web-kit browsers...
[20:15:43] <Lonestar99> Hawkee: yeah i see the cursor issue with opera... right now i too am facing some weird ass error... not sure if it is css,jquery or what...
[20:16:20] <Hawkee> yes, just not compatible with IE8
[20:16:28] <Hawkee> ever other browser works
[20:17:26] <Lonestar99> i use opera as my default browser and do find certain behaviors wrong with opera, compared to other browsers...
[20:18:03] <Hawkee> yes, that's the problem with a wholly different engine
[20:18:10] <Hawkee> it'll always have its quirks
[20:18:19] <Hawkee> I'm looking at my stats and seeing only 4% are on Opera
[20:18:35] <Hawkee> so I may just need to come up with a messy solution for that 4%
[20:19:09] <Lonestar99> Hawkee: i give up on my issue, gonna just devise a dirty fix... oh well
[20:22:19] <Lonestar99> it is nuts but my blackberry hotspot works better than my time warner internet...
[20:25:41] <sharkmonkey> How would i post to a new page without ajax/xmlhttpreqests. Load an entirely new page with POST data?
[20:25:48] <tash> http://pastie.org/3724670j <--- I could use some help.  I have several table rows that have the td's shown in the pastie.  Every row has different values for it's respective td's.  You can ignore my php and just assume there is a static value.  What I'm trying to figure out is, how can I get the value of each td into a var or something?
[20:26:30] <Hawkee> Lonestar99, I may have come up with a dirty solution myself..
[20:26:46] <Hawkee> when I click on the nested div I turn contenteditable=false to the outside element
[20:27:31] <tash> I have a script that opens a modal form and would like the modal form's elements to hold the values that are in the <td>'s ... hopefully my questions don't suck, I'm having a hard time explaining.
[20:28:29] <Lonestar99> Hawkee: sweet, i hate dirty solutions, but oh well, sometimes dirty is better than nothing
[20:28:41] <Hawkee> right
[20:35:36] <VioByte> ugh.. right in the middle of rewriting his code and fixing major flaws... then he leaves.
[20:35:38] <VioByte> oh well.
[20:37:37] <VioByte> its funny how people neglect _POST by not cleaning it and using a var from it as a filename to store data on the file system.
[20:37:41] <VioByte> it's sad really.
[20:38:32] <coldhead> it is, sad as drowning puppies
[20:39:20] <katya^> does $(selector).html() return only the inner html, or the html of the entire node and its descendants?
[20:39:20] <VioByte> Anyways.. back to my question... anyone know of a way to simulate a click on an object?
[20:39:56] <raj> I'm looking at https://gist.github.com/854622 and wondering what this bit of code is doing in there--> http://paste.ofcode.org/ShUjXXkpZVhN4fvTrm45P6 at line 69
[20:40:15] <VioByte> katya^: .html is used to set the html inside of the dom
[20:40:41] <VioByte> oh
[20:40:48] <VioByte> n/m it does get as well.
[20:40:58] <VioByte> ?.html
[20:40:58] <bot-t> .html(): Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/html/
[20:41:32] <VioByte> i've always used it to write html.. never had a need to get.
[20:41:56] <VioByte> no wait.. thats .load
[20:42:01] <VioByte> ?.load
[20:42:01] <bot-t> .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[20:42:45] <VioByte> katya^: from the looks of it... its everything in that dom
[20:43:17] <VioByte> katya^: so yea.. everything including its children
[20:44:03] <katya^> hm
[20:48:46] <VioByte> @katya^ ?.not
[20:48:51] <VioByte> hmm
[20:48:54] <VioByte> ?.not
[20:48:54] <bot-t> .not(selector): Remove elements from the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/not/
[20:49:01] <VioByte> you chould check that out
[20:49:16] <VioByte> to exclud the children from being selected in the .html
[20:49:21] <VioByte> exclude*
[20:49:26] <katya^> that's not what i'm after, but i think there's a better way anyhow
[20:52:27] <raj> coldhead, i know you know the answer =)
[21:00:58] <ngharo> raj: its overriding <a> clicks with one that loads the href via ajax
[21:03:53] <raj> ngharo, a few followup questions: 1) why does it need $.fn.ajaxify? 2) what is event.which? 3) what is the purpose of returning true and false?
[21:04:15] <raj> 4) what is `this` on line 72?
[21:05:32] <ngharo> $.fn.ajaxify = fn; creates a jquery plugin that can be called on any jquery object
[21:06:32] <ngharo> event.which usually used to catch which key was pressed on keyboard events but I guess it also can detect CTRL clicks etc
[21:06:57] <ngharo> if you return true, the event will continue its default behavior (navigate the page)
[21:07:37] <raj> how does returning true do that?
[21:07:40] <ngharo> this is the current working element in the passed jquery object. $(body).ajaxify() -> this = body
[21:08:19] <ngharo> raj: it allows the event to continue to bubble
[21:08:59] <raj> oh, so that's a feature of .click functions (returning true/false), very cool
[21:09:09] <Lonestar99> ok found the bug, but not sure how to fix it--> http://jsfiddle.net/fR5eb/3/
[21:09:16] <Cork> no return true doens't mean continue, return false means break the loop; anything that doesn't convert to false means contuinue
[21:09:43] <raj> k
[21:09:44] <ngharo> tru.dat
[21:09:55] <Cork> ex. just return;
[21:09:59] <s34n_> what http status codes trigger an ajax success event?
[21:10:09] <Cork> s34n_: 200
[21:10:26] <s34n_> not 201 or any other 2xx?
[21:10:28] <raj> why is event.preventDefault() needed AND return false?
[21:10:41] <Cork> s34n_: yes 2xx means success to
[21:11:41] <Lonestar99> i want to copy to clipboard which works if link is not inside a display:none element,  why will it not work in div which is clicked from display:none to display:block --> http://jsfiddle.net/fR5eb/3/
[21:11:50] <Cork> s34n_: to be cody => if ( status >= 200 && status < 300 || status === 304 )
[21:11:56] <s34n_> Cork: and the event fires after the redirect on a 201?
[21:12:19] <Cork> s34n_: 300 isn't a success status
[21:12:30] <s34n_> got it
[21:12:30] <Cork> and it doesn't reach the script
[21:12:42] <Cork> the browser catches it and follows it
[21:12:49] <s34n_> right
[21:13:20] <s34n_> but it must come back to the script eventually to trigger a success event
[21:13:38] <Cork> yes, but then its a 200 status most of the time
[21:13:56] <s34n_> k
[21:14:00] <Cork> req > 301 > 301 > 200
[21:14:01] <s34n_> that's what I expect
[21:14:01] <blendedbychris> i there some jquery stuff that specifically generates /#!/ urls
[21:14:10] <blendedbychris> i'm seeing them more often now
[21:14:28] <Cork> ?g history.js
[21:14:29] <bot-t> Cork, balupton/history.js · GitHub - https://github.com/balupton/History.js/
[21:14:50] <s34n_> so that means something else is broken for me
[21:16:51] <raj> I thought event.preventDefault() and returning false were alternatives to one another
[21:16:54] <raj> why use both?
[21:17:12] <Cork> no reason to use both
[21:17:19] <Cork> but no return false isn't an alternative
[21:17:31] <Cork> preventDefault prevents the browsers default action
[21:17:37] <Cork> all other bound events still triggers
[21:17:58] <Cork> returns breaks the event loop after the event, so no other events what so ever will be triggered
[21:18:19] <raj> returning false would prevent my other jquery bound events?
[21:18:32] <raj> (like if I had multiple click handlers for a particular element)
[21:18:38] <Cork> on that element yes
[21:18:44] <raj> wow, cool
[21:18:52] <raj> thanks Cork
[21:18:53] <Cork> thats why i say never to use return false
[21:19:01] <Cork> cause it depends on binding order
[21:19:15] <Cork> and will give unexpected effects quite often
[21:20:09] <Cork> if you want an event to not run if its been stopped, check for it in the respective events instead
[21:20:58] <raj> gotcha
[21:21:28] <katya^> this is weird
[21:21:31] <raj> what kinda selector is $('a:internal') anyway?
[21:21:38] <katya^> show() not removing the inline style display: none on an object
[21:21:41] <raj> never heard of internal before
[21:21:42] <katya^> object/element*
[21:21:51] <raj> does it really select internal links?
[21:22:02] <raj> or is that some custom thing by history.js ?
[21:22:14] <Cork> raj: that sounds like it has to be something added by a plugin
[21:22:21] <raj> ah, ok
[21:22:39] <Cork> (you can create your own :* selectors)
[21:23:26] <Cork> btw the check i taked about before is event.isDefaultPrevented
[21:24:35] <raj> oh, I thought you meant manually look over the click handlers
[21:24:46] <raj> that's very clever!
[21:24:51] <raj> i want your brain Cork
[21:25:12] <Cork> nothing special about that, its just experience
[21:25:37] <raj> yeah, but new knowledge makes me happy :)
[21:27:09] <Cork> theres event.isPropagationStopped and event.isImmediatePropagationStopped too
[21:27:19] <Cork> just for completness :)
[21:27:47] <raj> immediatePropagationStoped?
[21:27:50] <raj> what's up with that?
[21:28:06] <Cork> ?mdc stopImmidiatePropagation
[21:28:07] <bot-t> Cork, No results found for 'stopImmidiatePropagation'.
[21:28:13] <Cork> O_o
[21:28:29] <Cork> ah
[21:28:35] <Cork> ?mdc stopImmediatePropagation
[21:28:39] <bot-t> Cork, event.stopImmediatePropagation - MDN - Mozilla Developer Network - Prevents other listeners of the same event to be called. https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/event.stopImmediatePropagation
[21:28:49] <raj> oh, I never used that before
[21:29:18] <Cork> those tree are the same as return false;
[21:29:48] <Cork> event.preventDefault();event.stopImmediatePropagation();event.stopPropagation();
[21:29:52] <raj> gotcha
[21:30:10] <raj> i've used stopPropagation, not stopImmediatePropagation
[21:30:10] <Cork> in other words, stop everything :)
[21:30:32] <Cork> ya, normally you don't want to stop other events on the same elements anyway
[21:31:19] <raj> which is why return false isn't usually desirable
[21:33:49] <Cork> exactly
[21:35:42] <nerditkit> is there a way to select a specific meta tag if there are 4 without using 'meta[http-equiv=refresh]' ?
[21:37:10] <Cork> $('meta', document.head).eq(1)
[21:37:47] <Cork> though if you explicitly want the refresh one, you should use it
[21:38:56] <s34n_> does anybody here work on the transform plugin for xslt?
[21:40:25] <Cork> raj: a little funny side note onerror is an exception, it breaks the loop if you return true; not false :D
[21:41:18] <raj> oddly enough, i can see how that makes sense :)
[21:45:54] <Cork> hmm i've noticed that animations seam to stop working if you breakpoint the page (until you reload the page)
[21:46:59] <raj> is there an easy way for me to determine whether I need a semicolon or not?
[21:47:10] <raj> like a simple question to ask myself, so I can say AHHA
[21:47:27] <nerditkit> Cork, i explicitly want the refresh one
[21:47:29] <Cork> raj: js rarly demands it
[21:47:45] <Cork> nerditkit: what?
[21:48:00] <raj> k, so when MUST I use it?
[21:48:02] <nerditkit> Cork, i want to select the refresh meta
[21:48:10] <Cork> ah
[21:48:21] <Cork> then you should select on its attributes
[21:48:28] <Cork> or give it a class or id
[21:49:04] <nerditkit> it doesnt have an id and i cant set one
[21:49:27] <Cork> the last two means you would have to modify the html ya
[21:49:31] <katya^> is there something that needs to be done before newly added elements (eg with $(ctx).prepend(...)) can be found with document.getElementById() ?
[21:49:36] <katya^> like a flush or something
[21:49:49] <Cork> no
[21:50:24] <katya^> for some reason, a perfectly valid selector is not working, getElementById('name') returns null
[21:50:47] <katya^> $(this) works when handling events, but i can't get a context by selector
[21:50:55] <Cork> prepend is used from ajax?
[21:51:14] <katya^> no
[21:51:19] <Cork> anyway see ?demo
[21:51:20] <bot-t> Please create a live (working) demo of your problem on http://jsfiddle.net or provide a link to your site with instructions on how to reproduce the issue.
[21:54:03] <nerditkit> 'meta[http-equiv=refresh]' this isnt working in my parser :(
[21:54:30] <innociv> Getting this too much recursion infinite loop in firefox but not chrome when i change from 1.5.2 to 1.6.2 or 1.7.1 :|  I can't figure out why.  I have no way of inspecting when it freezes
[21:54:31] <Cork> try 'meta[http-equiv*="refresh"]'
[21:55:02] <innociv> nevermind 1.6.2 works 1.7.1 does the infinite loop freezing
[21:55:23] <Cork> innociv: if you retrigger events, that works radically different and often causes it
[21:55:43] <Cork> chrome gets the same error, but it just burns away the cpu and doens't say anything
[21:56:06] <innociv> No error in chrome, works ifne
[21:56:20] <nerditkit> Error: No elements matching 'meta[http-equiv*="refresh"]'
[21:56:27] <Cork> you don't get errors, but you get the same effect and there is an error in it
[21:56:39] <innociv> It doesn't lag/crash in chrome either.
[21:57:31] <Cork> nerditkit: hmm that should work, one sec
[21:57:33] <nerditkit> can i select an element by number? i want to select the second meta
[22:00:35] <Cork> nerditkit: did you really use $('meta[http-equiv="refresh"]', document.head) ?
[22:00:36] <Cork> wfm
[22:00:36] <caniuse> Cork: Works For Me
[22:01:15] <nerditkit> Im using $('meta[http-equiv="refresh"]').each(function (j, a) {
[22:01:26] <Cork> you need to point at head
[22:02:01] <nerditkit> Cork, like so? $('meta[http-equiv="refresh"]',document.head).each(function (j, a) {
[22:02:18] <Cork> hmm sorry na, its not needed
[22:02:53] <Cork> nerditkit: anyway what are you trying to do?
[22:03:28] <nerditkit> Cork, I am trying to select the url inside the meta tag
[22:04:52] <katya^> http://pastebin.com/j3Ga4G3V this is the area that's causing problems, maybe someone more familiar with js/jq could shed some light on it
[22:05:08] <Cork> nerditkit: $('meta[http-equiv="refresh"]').prop('content').match(/url=([^ ]*)/)[1] should work
[22:05:50] <katya^> basically as a progressive enhancement of an ugly form element, i replace the label (span in this case) / input pair with a link / input pair, where only one of the two is visible at a time
[22:06:44] <katya^> when the link is clicked, it hides and the input shows, but on input's blur() event, the link's show() fails
[22:07:10] <katya^> in the deboogerer i see that getElementById(...) fails, even though I can see in the elements view (with chrome developer tools) that it exists
[22:07:12] <Cork> nerditkit: http://jsbin.com/atupiy
[22:08:15] <nerditkit> Cork, its a blank page
[22:08:26] <katya^> i could probably manually remove the style attribute from the element, but i'd prefer to use show() if possible
[22:08:32] <Cork> nerditkit: check the console
[22:08:47] <Cork> katya^: i asked for a live page or a demo not a code dump
[22:08:59] <katya^> well i'm sorry but I can't provide a live page demo
[22:09:21] <Cork> then you'll have to research what happens
[22:09:33] <Cork> cause without seeing it, one can only guess
[22:09:39] <katya^> i've been doing that, all that happens is that getElementById() fails inexplicably
[22:09:43] <nerditkit> Cork, selects reslative urls as well?
[22:09:59] <nerditkit> relative*
[22:10:00] <Cork> nerditkit: reslative?
[22:10:04] <Cork> ah :)
[22:10:04] <Cork> yes
[22:15:23] <katya^> good news, problem solved
[22:15:33] <katya^> thanks to one man's ability to read my drunken code
[22:55:23] <yamama> I'm looking for a utility to position markers on an image + be able to zoom in / out on the image. any good recos
[22:57:12] <katya^> define zoom in/out
[22:57:27] <katya^> lightbox or zooma work well, but do different things
[22:57:41] <yamama> webkit transform or css width
[22:57:45] <katya^> not sure about the marker positioning though
[22:58:15] <yamama> i'm looking for something that'd allow to reposition the marker after changing the zooming and panning
[22:59:05] <yamama> something like google maps, but without bothering to load tiles
[23:01:39] <yamama> katya^: any clue ?
[23:01:51] <katya^> it's not something i've needed myself
[23:02:15] <katya^> there's probably some way to hack zooma or similar into doing something like that though
[23:03:04] <yamama> zooma : http://aimtec.com.au/zooma/ ?
[23:04:16] <yamama> katya^: btw tried hacking photoswipe but the translations infos aren't very reliable or i lack documentation
[23:05:25] <katya^> mm
[23:10:20] <raj> is this line necessary? var $ = window.jQuery; ?
[23:10:50] <Cork> no
[23:11:00] <Cork> not normally at least
[23:11:05] <raj> certainly some funny stuff in here
[23:11:15] <raj> (looking at the same code Cork)
[23:11:32] <Cork> what code?
[23:11:41] <raj> https://gist.github.com/854622#file_ajaxify_html5.js
[23:11:48] <raj> line 7
[23:11:57] <raj> i asked earlier about like 69
[23:12:16] <raj> so is $ normally jQuery or window.jQuery?
[23:12:26] <Cork> they just choose to do it that way instead of through the wrapper
[23:12:49] <raj> is it for old jquery compatibility?
[23:12:57] <Cork> not really
[23:13:06] <raj> also, is document = window.document necessary?
[23:13:25] <Cork> they just defin $ localy so its garanteed to be jQuery (if theres another framework using $)
[23:13:49] <raj> oh, i see
[23:13:54] <Cork> raj: those are minification optimizasions
[23:14:19] <raj> defining $ is for minification?
[23:14:26] <Cork> when you minimize the code document, window and other unknown variables can't be shortend
[23:14:28] <Cork> no
[23:14:44] <Cork> raj: theres other frameworks that use $
[23:14:50] <raj> right, like mootools
[23:14:59] <Cork> and prototype
[23:15:01] <Cork> and so on yes
[23:15:02] <raj> which I'm not using and probably never will
[23:15:20] <Cork> plugins should take it into account anyway
[23:15:32] <raj> ok, and what about document = window.document?
[23:15:33] <Cork> back to redeclaring objects
[23:15:37] <raj> that's for minification purposes?
[23:16:01] <Cork> if you have (function() { document.body.innerHTML = 'something'; });
[23:16:08] <Cork> that can't really be minimized
[23:16:34] <Cork> if you on the other hand have e (function(document) { document.body.innerHTML = 'something'; })(document);
[23:16:53] <Cork> it can be minimized to (function(d) { d.body.innerHTML = 'something'; })(document)
[23:17:35] <raj> interesting
[23:17:38] <Cork> thats why many plugins redeclare window, document and other long global variable names
[23:18:11] <Cork> (like undefined)
[23:18:25] <raj> undefined?
[23:18:32] <raj> that's a global variable?
[23:18:33] <Cork> line 2
[23:18:35] <Cork> yes
[23:18:47] <coldhead> ?eval typeof undefined
[23:18:49] <bot-t> coldhead: "undefined"
[23:19:02] <Cork> ?eval var a = {}; a.something == undefined;
[23:19:03] <bot-t> Cork: true
[23:19:09] <Cork> ?eval var a = {}; undefined = 10;  a.something == undefined;
[23:19:10] <bot-t> Cork: false
[23:19:16] <coldhead> ?eval typeof undefined === typeof {}
[23:19:17] <bot-t> coldhead: false
[23:19:33] <coldhead> omg you broke the javascript
[23:19:40] <Cork> :D
[23:19:46] <coldhead> ?eval undefined = Infinity
[23:19:46] <bot-t> coldhead: Infinity
[23:19:50] <coldhead> thanks bot-t
[23:19:51] <bot-t> coldhead, I'm a bot you know..
[23:20:20] <raj> word
[23:20:21] <caniuse> raj: bond
[23:20:33] <raj> oh, wrong bot :)
[23:20:37] <raj> love that response
[23:21:08] <raj> ok, so undefined can then be minified
[23:21:17] <Cork> exactly
[23:21:36] <raj> would it be a bad idea to worry about such things when I'm completely done with my site?
[23:21:55] <raj> as in, not taking into account minification optimizations until I reach that point?
[23:22:09] <raj> ...thereby, not defining document = window.document, etc
[23:22:14] <Cork> raj: normally theres little reason to take it into account at all
[23:22:32] <raj> k, that's good news
[23:22:37] <Cork> its worth if you write a big plugin, but rarly for pages
[23:23:07] <Cork> and you normally don't minify the js you write in the page
[23:23:24] <Cork> and then that would add data not reduce it
[23:23:54] <Hereisanotherlie> Cork: how would minifying js add data
[23:26:44] <raj> I wonder why there is no API documentatoin available for history.js
[23:26:59] <raj> i'm gonna have to read through 2000 lines of code https://github.com/balupton/history.js/blob/master/scripts/uncompressed/history.js
[23:27:21] <raj> just to learn what methods I have access to
[23:28:13] <amit_usual> in javascript regex how do you define or
[23:29:01] <coldhead> var re = /some.?thing/;
[23:29:09] <coldhead> re.test('something')
[23:29:55] <coldhead> raj: you could always write the docs yourself and submit a pull request
[23:30:07] <coldhead> then no one will ever have this problem again
[23:30:08] <f0rkn1ght> Question lets say I make an array of tags, now I want to show them all but only show a certain number of characters in each line, and order them to be equal
[23:30:12] <coldhead> and you will get fan mail and $$
[23:30:52] <raj> i feel like I must be mistaken
[23:31:26] <f0rkn1ght> ?
[23:33:05] <Hereisanotherlie> how is the new plugin site coming along?
[23:33:26] <coldhead> i think ajpiano is almost ready to delete the database again, Hereisanotherlie
[23:33:47] <coldhead> f0rkn1ght: your question lacks clarity
[23:33:58] <raj> oh, i didn't realize that was mr. piano
[23:34:00] <coldhead> i don't understand what you mean by "characters" if the array is of "tags"
[23:34:01] <Eviltwin> Most questions here lack clarity
[23:34:02] <raj> working on it
[23:34:12] <coldhead> and i don't know what you mean by "order"
[23:34:25] <f0rkn1ght> coldhead,  http://www.stevencodes.com/php-snippets-latest    Trying to arrange those little boxes into a square its a php array list and need it to be a box
[23:34:32] <Hereisanotherlie> coldhead: is there any way for someone to help with the site development?
[23:34:52] <coldhead> Hereisanotherlie: talk to ajpiano or danheberden when they're not busy getting drunk at JSConf
[23:34:56] <coldhead> many hands and all that <3
[23:35:05] <Hereisanotherlie> yeah it makes sense
[23:35:19] <coldhead> hard problem, f0rkn1ght
[23:35:36] <f0rkn1ght> coldhead,  Very lol been lookin for about two weeks
[23:35:52] <raj> when's jsconf?
[23:36:14] <coldhead> it's happening now, raj
[23:36:21] <raj> oh
[23:36:23] <raj> ur there?
[23:36:34] <coldhead> i wish
[23:36:44] <f0rkn1ght> hmm
[23:36:45] <coldhead> i wouldn't be wasting time on irc if i were
[23:36:50] <coldhead> f0rkn1ght: you kind of want http://masonry.desandro.com/
[23:36:56] <coldhead> but horizontal, not vertical
[23:37:16] <Hereisanotherlie> f0rkn1ght: what do you use for the social icons on the left of your page?
[23:37:26] <f0rkn1ght> Hereisanotherlie,  Made them
[23:37:33] <f0rkn1ght> Hereisanotherlie,  It's WP social Slider plugin
[23:37:58] <Hereisanotherlie> oh ok thanks
[23:38:21] <f0rkn1ght> coldhead,  Yeah I know but more or less I tried with PHP but no one in ##php helped at all lol
[23:38:32] <coldhead> its not a php problem
[23:39:11] <coldhead> i would try grouping them into <p>s based on character count, so that each <p> would be relatively full
[23:39:42] <coldhead> then i would give each a in each div the width (p.width / p > a.length)
[23:39:52] <coldhead> but that is still probably going to suck donkeys
[23:39:55] <raj> black label with gingerale is pretty good
[23:39:57] <raj> never had it before
[23:40:01] <f0rkn1ght> yeah
[23:40:01] <coldhead> then i would just do a different design
[23:40:08] <coldhead> that doesn't have the problem
[23:40:13] <f0rkn1ght> lol true
[23:40:18] <coldhead> and if that didn't help i'd try to transition into landscape gardening
[23:40:22] <coldhead> or beekeeping
[23:40:27] <coldhead> something outdoorsy
[23:48:48] <vl1234> gud afternoon
[23:48:59] <vl1234> i have a small doubt

[23:54:37] <Cork> or $('input').eq(10).prop('type')
