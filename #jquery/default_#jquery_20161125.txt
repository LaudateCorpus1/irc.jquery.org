[00:19:37] <satendra> please anyone help me
[00:23:30] <satendra> IS there anyone who have expertise on jquery UI
[00:23:32] <satendra> ?
[01:51:34] <satendra> hi ??
[03:16:33] <Sayona> hello
[03:19:40] <satendra> hi
[03:19:46] <satendra> Sayona
[03:34:02] <Sayona> Hi, how I append using a variable ?
[03:34:12] <Sayona> var value = $("form input[type='radio']:checked").val();
[03:34:19] <Sayona> $('span.camp_caractere').append('<b>" + value + "</b>')
[03:34:27] <Sayona> not work add me + value +
[03:36:42] <slax0r> ...........
[03:36:45] <slax0r> o________________O
[03:37:03] <slax0r> really think about what you did there...
[03:37:55] <Sayona> i try to get a value="" from a input and to autocomplete in a span with id camp_caractere
[03:39:04] <Cork> Sayona: you're using " and ' in the append
[03:39:08] <Sayona> I think i found a solution
[03:39:13] <Sayona> i remove " '
[03:39:14] <Cork> else it would work, though it wouldn't be recommended
[03:39:16] <Sayona> thanks :)
[03:39:19] <slax0r> learn about the basics of javascript http://www.2ality.com/2013/06/basic-javascript.html
[03:39:22] <slax0r> or even better
[03:39:26] <slax0r> learn about the basics of programming
[03:39:34] <Cork> the recommended solution would be append($('<b>').text(value))
[03:39:49] <Sayona> thanks
[03:42:05] <Vict0r> :D
[03:42:14] <Vict0r> ðŸ’£
[03:42:39] <Sayona> data-modul-charactere="833" , i have this attribute in input, is a way to get this value ?
[03:43:01] <Cork> you man convert it to unicode?
[03:43:05] <Cork> or what exactly are you asking?
[03:43:08] <Vict0r> .data("module-charactere");
[03:44:13] <Sayona> <input name="anunt_optiune_radio" value="2" data-modul-pret="2750" data-modul-charactere="1804" type="radio">
[03:44:51] <Vict0r> Sayona  gave you the answer
[03:45:00] <Sayona> Vict0r, yes, let me try :*
[03:45:19] <Vict0r> no homo please
[03:45:35] <Vict0r> :P
[03:45:39] <Sayona> I am a girl :)
[03:46:16] <slax0r> rule 30
[03:46:20] <slax0r> there are no girls on the internet
[03:46:28] <Vict0r> now you will get ton of private messages
[03:46:38] <slax0r> and do educate your self on the very basics of programming, algorithms, and javascript
[03:46:53] <slax0r> because you seem to be lacking those
[03:47:30] <Sayona> slax0r, thanks I learn only if i do the stuff.
[03:48:02] <slax0r> no, you learn by learning...if you're having trouble with concatenating strings, you wont learn properly by "do the stuff"
[03:48:18] <slax0r> you're just trying and failing, and bugging people to be your tutor
[03:48:33] <Vict0r> slax0r   is a mean person
[03:48:41] <Sayona> slax0r, you are ugly :)
[03:49:07] <slax0r> I just tell the truth
[03:49:11] <Vict0r> he is :P
[03:52:11] <Sayona> My problem now is if i use my code... jquery add data and not remove the old data
[03:53:16] <Vict0r> whats your code?
[03:54:00] <Sayona> Vict0r, http://pastebin.ca/3742105
[03:54:21] <Vict0r> well you are appending
[03:54:35] <Vict0r> what do you expect to happen?
[03:55:12] <Vict0r> you could do like  just like this
[03:55:28] <Sayona> I have a lot of input radio , and a <span> when i click the radio to add the data in span but to remove the old data
[03:55:32] <slax0r> ...
[03:55:36] <slax0r> I rest my case
[03:55:38] <Vict0r> $('span.camp_caractere').html($(this).data("moduleCharactere"));
[03:55:53] <Vict0r> something like that
[03:56:16] <Sayona> yes that not work
[03:56:19] <Sayona> i try
[03:57:30] <Vict0r> you dont know what you are doing
[03:57:49] <Vict0r> you are just doing "try and see" stuff
[03:58:35] <slax0r> as opposed to what I said ~10 minutes before
[03:59:15] <Sayona> thanks
[04:01:51] <Sayona> I use .remove();
[04:05:32] <Sayona> Question: is safe to use $('span.camp_caractere').html(''); ?
[04:05:36] <Sayona> to clear data?
[04:09:17] <satendra> there is anyone who can help me for jquery
[04:09:35] <Vict0r> maybe
[04:09:39] <Vict0r> just ask your wquesiton

[04:56:59] <AdamPDotty> Do you have a fiddle for that?
[04:57:11] <AdamPDotty> satendra ^
[04:57:34] <AdamPDotty> Do not know UI too well, but could have a look.
[05:16:41] <satendra> AdamPDotty : Right now I have not fiddle but you can see on stackoverflow I send a link
[05:16:46] <satendra> please above
[05:39:14] <AdamPDotty> as for question two, you have the element in a varable, then just call element.draggable();
[05:39:40] <AdamPDotty> or in the simple example: $('.dropped').draggable();
[05:41:39] <AdamPDotty> hmm and else I do not seem to get the problem

[08:28:30] <highland4r> hello, how do i get the opposite of has() ? i tried with filter but i can't get it to work
[08:34:41] <highland4r> nvm, managed to find another way

[09:57:14] <relipse> is it possible if someone goes to https://www.handofhelp.com/resources/ and tells me if the books are slow and chopy in the rotating wheel?
[10:37:35] <jquery745> how are you?
[11:01:02] <PCatinean> hey guys
[11:01:20] <PCatinean> if I do var x= $('element') how do I then search for something inside that element? for a example a unique id in id
[11:02:12] <taplar> x.find(...)
[11:03:02] <taplar> however if it is an id you might as well just do $()
[11:03:16] <PCatinean> just dawned on me taplar indeed
[11:03:58] <PCatinean> and selector for element that does NOT have class x?
[11:04:23] <taplar> $(...).not(...)
[11:04:45] <taplar> or if you like the pseudo selectors, $(':not(...)')
[11:10:01] <z1haze_work> how would i select :selected :not(:disabled)
[11:10:35] <taplar> no space
[11:10:45] <z1haze_work> other than that the syntax is good?
[11:10:46] <taplar> assuming your targeting a single item(s)
[11:11:00] <z1haze_work> trying to get all selected options of a multiple select
[11:11:04] <taplar> personally i avoid the pseudo selectors if i can
[11:11:06] <z1haze_work> but my first option is a disabled selected option
[11:11:40] <z1haze_work> $('option:selected:not(:disabled)') would this be it?
[11:12:34] <taplar> don't you want where the select is not disabled?
[11:12:47] <z1haze_work> yea
[11:12:58] <z1haze_work> all selected options but not the disabled one
[11:13:20] <taplar> so you are disabling actual <option> ?
[11:13:26] <z1haze_work> yep
[11:13:27] <z1haze_work> the first one
[11:13:29] <taplar> huh
[11:13:30] <z1haze_work> its like a placeholder
[11:13:49] <z1haze_work> <option selected disabled>Select your value</option
[11:14:11] <z1haze_work> id imagine not so uncommon
[11:14:28] <taplar> $('option').filter(function(){ return !this.disabled && this.checked; });
[11:14:29] <taplar> try that
[11:17:43] <z1haze_work> option:selected:not([disabled])
[11:17:59] <l33n> for this json: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/e7c6640c6ad5d27881a5a81d7d68f734, i stored it in a variable called hydrants, if i do Object.keys(hydrants), what are the keys here?
[11:18:50] <taplar> why do you ask?
[11:18:58] <taplar> Object.keys tells you that
[11:19:19] <z1haze_work> link is broken too
[11:19:26] <taplar> take off the comma
[11:19:33] <z1haze_work> ah
[11:19:38] <taplar> ya, i hate that
[11:19:48] <l33n> ok ty
[11:20:25] <taplar> l33n: are you confused about what Object.keys is returning, or... ?
[11:20:33] <l33n> well
[11:21:06] <l33n> i used to have code like this https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2879cc2b4a955dfca74b4e5d04a310eb
[11:21:18] <l33n> but now instead of an array, i have this json
[11:21:50] <taplar> ah
[11:22:16] <l33n> and instead of a loop, i have .each, and i want to
[11:22:19] <taplar> is the json subject to change?
[11:22:23] <l33n> yes
[11:22:25] <l33n> very much
[11:22:28] <l33n> lol
[11:22:37] <l33n> whatever works
[11:22:39] <taplar> ok then, i would suggest you change it to be an array again, but only on the outer part
[11:22:59] <l33n> so just put brackets aroudn the entire thing?
[11:23:09] <taplar> no, how are you creating this json?
[11:23:16] <shoky> why an array?
[11:23:17] <l33n> i have a rails
[11:23:20] <taplar> err, yes, square brackets
[11:23:27] <l33n> project
[11:23:27] <shoky> l33n said last night he needs to access by id
[11:23:40] <shoky> e.g. hydrants[1] for id 1
[11:23:41] <taplar> right, he has id in the nested objects
[11:23:55] <shoky> yea but that doesn't help him select by id
[11:24:01] <taplar> aaaaah
[11:24:06] <taplar> welp, :D
[11:24:43] <taplar> so yeah, you can use $.each on an object and it will pass in the key, value pair
[11:24:57] <z1haze_work> like this? https://jsfiddle.net/pcznfz4t/
[11:25:03] <shoky> or use Object.keys like we showed you last night :S
[11:25:04] <l33n> in this json though, arent there like 10 key value pairs?
[11:25:19] <l33n> everything that is separated by :
[11:25:19] <taplar> Object.keys() goes one level deep
[11:25:31] <taplar> it's not all keys
[11:25:37] <l33n> ok
[11:25:41] <shoky> hm?
[11:25:52] <shoky> as opposed to what
[11:26:00] <z1haze_work> nested objects?
[11:26:12] <taplar> yep
[11:26:15] <shoky> yea but what goes more than one level deep
[11:26:18] <taplar> he has an object with keys for nested objects
[11:26:39] <taplar> no i said Object.keys() does not go more than one level deep
[11:26:49] <shoky> ya and i asked as opposed to what :P
[11:26:51] <l33n> so in this case, the Object.keys() will be 1, 2, and 3?
[11:26:56] <shoky> l33n yes
[11:27:00] <l33n> ok
[11:27:04] <taplar> his question seemed to suggest he thought it returned all keys
[11:27:07] <shoky> it will be an array with the ids
[11:27:13] <shoky> ah
[11:27:16] <l33n> ok
[11:27:24] <z1haze_work> i hought he wanted the keys for the the properties of the objects
[11:27:35] <ilithium> Hey all; anyone here used fullcalendar.io and created a CustomView?
[11:27:36] <shoky> he didn't say what he wants, fwiw :)
[11:27:43] <z1haze_work> it makes the most sense..
[11:27:55] <l33n> out of curiousity, how would i get all the keys?
[11:28:02] <l33n> like for the nested objects
[11:28:08] <z1haze_work> https://jsfiddle.net/pcznfz4t/
[11:28:20] <shoky> you'd have to do a nested loop
[11:28:22] <taplar> l33n: what are you trying to do?
[11:28:43] <shoky> (or a nested Object.keys() anyway)
[11:28:51] <l33n> i want to recerate this code only with the json instead of the array
[11:28:53] <l33n> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/2879cc2b4a955dfca74b4e5d04a310eb
[11:28:57] <PCatinean> taplar, if I store all elements with class x, how can I get all of them who have a additional class y and the ones that do not?
[11:29:06] <shoky> :S
[11:29:10] <z1haze_work> :\
[11:29:14] <z1haze_work> i literally just showed you how
[11:29:23] <taplar> PCatinean: $allElements.filter('.otherClass')
[11:29:32] <taplar> $allElements.not('.otherClass')
[11:29:41] <PCatinean> ah aweosme there's that method, thank you taplar! :D
[11:30:27] <PCatinean> can I do a filter and a subtraction or which one is fastest?
[11:30:45] <taplar> uh, dunno
[11:30:50] <taplar> sure you can do something like
[11:31:05] <taplar> $allElements.not($allElements.filter('.otherClass'))
[11:31:15] <taplar> if you stored the first filter in another variable
[11:31:22] <PCatinean> yes I did hmm
[11:31:43] <shoky> one or the other is fastest, irrelevant to you ;)
[11:34:55] <taplar> l33n: instead of changing the json to work still with your existing logic, why not change your logic to work with your markup?
[11:35:09] <taplar> because as it is some of your logic isn't going to work
[11:35:22] <l33n> ok
[11:35:23] <taplar> such as line 17
[11:35:48] <l33n> yeah, i see that that is f'd up
[11:35:56] <l33n> i was just messing around because i couldnt get it to work
[11:35:58] <l33n> ok
[11:37:31] <taplar> also if it becomes an issue you might look into how you are doing change_hydrant_data
[11:38:15] <taplar> you are causing potentially 7 page redraws for every call of that method
[11:38:30] <taplar> and you are calling it in a loop
[11:41:46] <l33n> im not sure i understand taplar
[11:42:35] <taplar> k.  any time you change how/what things are displayed on the page, you cause the browser to do either a redraw or a reflow
[11:42:57] <taplar> such as changing content or changing styles
[11:43:12] <l33n> ok
[11:43:21] <taplar> every time you are doing innerHTML = 'something' you are causing the content to change.
[11:43:44] <taplar> from a performance standpoint, it would be better to make all your changes and then apply them to the dom
[11:44:05] <taplar> but again, if you are not seeing a performance issue at this time, just something to keep in your mind
[11:44:18] <PCatinean> apparently if you put hidden class on a elemtn show() does not work
[11:44:20] <l33n> so maybe create a table
[11:44:29] <l33n> generate a table
[11:44:37] <taplar> PCatinean: show/hide only add/remove the inline style
[11:44:55] <l33n> instead of copy a template and renaming the elements, generate the elements before hand
[11:45:17] <taplar> l33n: work on getting it to work first, then you can think about performance, ;)
[11:45:21] <l33n> ok
[11:45:51] <PCatinean> undestood
[11:45:58] <l33n> if i did a for loop with i < Object.keys().length i++, i would be 3, and i could use that as my i in the existing code?
[11:46:14] <taplar> you should use a forEach instead
[11:46:49] <taplar> Object.keys(theObject).forEach(function(key, index){ ... });
[11:46:53] <l33n> ok ill look that
[11:46:54] <l33n> ok
[11:47:21] <taplar> when possible use forEach so you do not have to do the boilerplating yourself
[11:48:15] <z1haze_work> i think its index, value though, right?
[11:48:22] <taplar> not for forEach
[11:48:28] <taplar> it's jquery that flips them
[11:48:33] <z1haze_work> ah
[11:48:40] <z1haze_work> is $.each the exact same?
[11:48:44] <taplar> nope
[11:48:52] <z1haze_work> what does it do differently
[11:49:13] <taplar> http://www.james.padolsey.com/jquery/#v=git&fn=jQuery.each
[11:49:41] <taplar> i was expecting it would try to use forEach, but it doesn't look like it even tries to use it
[11:50:51] <z1haze_work> cool site
[11:50:57] <l33n> in Object.keys(theObject).forEach(function(key, index){ ... }), the inner code would be what to store the length of all keys in a variable?
[11:51:26] <taplar> the inner code would be whatever you want to do, now that you have a single key of the object
[11:52:05] <z1haze_work> think im callin it a day
[11:52:08] <z1haze_work> shouldnt even be here
[11:52:19] <z1haze_work> who fkn works the day afte thanksgiving
[11:52:24] <taplar> <-- this guy
[11:52:30] <z1haze_work> lol
[11:52:40] <z1haze_work> pointless
[11:52:46] <taplar> though only 3 peeps on my team are in the office
[11:52:51] <z1haze_work> anyway, im out
[11:52:57] <taplar> l8r man
[11:58:43] <l33n> how to access the value of each key in Object.keys(theObject).forEach(function(key, index){ ... })?
[11:59:22] <taplar> theObject[key]
[12:00:01] <l33n> i want to do something like this though https://gist.github.com/anonymous/ba62405f241b3d8ed3deb7eb2c58e3ab
[12:00:40] <taplar> 'key' is a variable containing the actual value
[12:00:47] <taplar> which is why you need to do array notation
[12:01:49] <taplar> and from the json you provided earlier, the value of theObject[key] for the first forEach will be another object, so you will have to handle for that oo
[12:01:51] <taplar> *too
[12:03:20] <l33n> ok so just https://gist.github.com/anonymous/059ebf661db15d85c777adf4e128b747
[12:03:50] <taplar> uh, why are you using numbers?
[12:05:18] <l33n> i want to have the hydrant ids be hydrant-1, hydrant-2, hydrant-3
[12:05:31] <taplar> they will be
[12:05:46] <taplar> if you use the key
[12:06:10] <taplar> as your json is, your key will be "1", "2", "3" for each iteration
[12:06:30] <taplar> you get that right?
[12:06:44] <l33n> yeah
[12:07:02] <l33n> so in the gist i sent, what did i do wrong
[12:07:19] <taplar> new_elem.id = "hydrant-" + hydrants[1];
[12:07:33] <taplar> you are using the number 1, and not using key any where
[12:07:52] <taplar> further more, if you want your id to be "hydrant-#", why do you need to access the object?
[12:09:48] <l33n> because i want the code to be able to handle a variable json, like, if there were more than 3, i want it to read the json and create elements according to a variable number of keys
[12:10:03] <taplar> heh, so i will repeat myself
[12:10:10] <taplar> as your json is, your key will be "1", "2", "3" for each iteration
[12:10:10] <taplar> you get that right?
[12:10:16] <l33n> yeah
[12:10:27] <taplar> you keep saying 'yeah' but...
[12:10:42] <l33n> how to access each key then?
[12:10:49] <taplar> you have the key
[12:10:55] <taplar> use it
[12:10:55] <l33n> syntactically
[12:11:03] <taplar> huh?
[12:11:21] <taplar> it's a string.  you can do whatever you want to with that that you can do with strings
[12:11:37] <l33n> is it hydrants[0].key?
[12:11:41] <taplar> no
[12:11:49] <taplar> key is key, it is being passed into your method
[12:11:54] <taplar> see it in the function arguments?
[12:12:15] <taplar> Object.keys(hydrants).forEach(function(key, index) {
[12:12:37] <l33n> ok, so it would be new_elem.id = "hydrant-" +key;
[12:12:44] <taplar> boom
[12:12:49] <l33n> ok ty, sorry
[12:16:21] <l33n> taplar, to access the objects each key refers to?
[12:16:55] <taplar> the 'key' is a variable containing the value of a key in hydrants
[12:17:21] <l33n> yeah, but like you said before, i need to handle the objects the keys refer to also
[12:17:31] <l33n> if i want that data
[12:17:51] <taplar> so what are the different ways you can access elements of an object?
[12:18:12] <taplar> are you familiar?
[12:18:34] <l33n> not very
[12:18:54] <taplar> ok, there are two basic ways to access values of an object
[12:19:08] <taplar> one is with object notation.  this assumes you know the key ahead of time
[12:19:31] <l33n> ok
[12:19:40] <taplar> such as x = { me: 'you' } <-- you could reference 'you' with x.me
[12:20:01] <taplar> x being the object and 'me' being the actual key value
[12:20:09] <l33n> ok
[12:20:42] <taplar> however if you have a variable then the way you would access it would be with array notation
[12:21:00] <taplar> because if key = 'me' and you try to do x.key
[12:21:08] <l33n> so in the "Object.keys(hydrants).forEach(function(key, index) {" i could do key.id
[12:21:10] <taplar> 'key' is not a key in the object
[12:21:17] <taplar> it's a variable
[12:21:24] <taplar> but javascript doesn't know what you mean
[12:21:35] <taplar> it's expecting the 'key' in that case to be an actual key
[12:21:45] <taplar> but with array notation: x[key]
[12:22:05] <taplar> it knows to interpret the value of key and look for the element with that key value
[12:22:27] <taplar> comprende?
[12:23:35] <taplar> as for your question, no.  in this case 'key' is a string
[12:23:47] <taplar> Object.keys() gives you an array of the keys
[12:24:01] <taplar> which are strings in your json
[12:24:59] <l33n> ok
[12:26:03] <taplar> so. in your case you have a variable 'key' that has the actual key value in it
[12:26:24] <taplar> how can we use that to get the object value for that key?
[12:27:26] <l33n> hydrant[key]
[12:27:35] <taplar> boom
[12:27:48] <l33n> hydrant[key].id?
[12:27:54] <l33n> for the id
[12:27:58] <taplar> yep, though your logic has it as 'hydrants'
[12:28:04] <l33n> ah yeah
[12:28:16] <l33n> ty
[12:29:11] <Sayona> Hi, I have a input hidden how the value of this is updated by click a calendar.. is a way to get value when i click on the calendar and to insert/add in a div as a text? becouse I try and not result
[12:29:33] <taplar> Sayona: show us what you are trying?
[12:29:48] <Sayona> let me to create a js
[12:29:50] <taplar> though i'm fixing to go get some food
[12:29:56] <taplar> some one else may pipe in
[12:30:04] <robertmaxrees> I'm around
[12:30:19] <taplar_lunch> round round get around.  i get around!  *singS*
[12:30:23] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[12:32:08] <Sayona> taplar_lunch, https://jsfiddle.net/0sps12zt/
[12:33:11] <robertmaxrees> Sayona so what's the issue?
[12:33:39] <Sayona> if the value is updated no add text in div
[12:34:01] <robertmaxrees> "if the value is updated" - but are you re-running the code?
[12:34:34] <Sayona> the value change
[12:34:52] <Sayona> every time I click on the Day of calendar
[12:34:54] <robertmaxrees> right - are you re-running this code when hat happens?
[12:35:06] <Sayona> who I do that?
[12:35:33] <robertmaxrees> well #datapublicare is a hidden input - you can't click on it.
[12:35:43] <robertmaxrees> what event on what element are you trying to listen to?
[12:36:09] <Sayona> <input type="hidden" class="hidden-val" id="datapublicare" name="datapublicare" value="28.11.2016, 29.11.2016, fdffddf">
[12:36:11] <robertmaxrees> because for the record - https://jsfiddle.net/0sps12zt/1/ the function works, your binding is the issue.
[12:36:27] <Sayona> this value is updated every time when I click on calendar data
[12:36:30] <robertmaxrees> right, you want your value from that.  you mentioned something about when you click on a calendar?
[12:37:08] <Sayona> var days = itemNode.multiDatesPicker("value");
[12:37:18] <Sayona> this is da value how update that filed
[12:37:21] <robertmaxrees> are you using a plugin?
[12:37:43] <Sayona> for calendar?
[12:37:48] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[12:38:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm trying to figure out what you're using to give you the best solution.
[12:39:07] <Sayona> Datapiker
[12:39:11] <robertmaxrees> link?
[12:39:24] <taplar_lunch> datepicker?
[12:39:35] <Sayona> yes taplar_lunch
[12:41:27] <chrisml> i need a dropdown pro... hover over "find" and then try hovering over "create new trip" how can i stop the other dropdown from appearing? http://jsbin.com/wofejofuwu/edit?html,css,js,output
[12:46:47] <taplar_lunch> chrisml: it looks like there is whitespace between your link and the menu it displays, so mouse drag down actually leaves the link hover
[12:47:33] <Sayona> taplar_lunch,  this is $(".totalclass.hasDatepicker").each(function()
[12:47:55] <chrisml> taplar_lunch i think it only leaves when it enters the blue link
[12:48:02] <robertmaxrees> Sayona are you using jquery ui's datepicker?
[12:48:11] <Sayona> yes
[12:48:17] <taplar_lunch> chrisml: put a border on the area you are doing that hover logic on. you'll see what i mean
[12:49:20] <robertmaxrees> Sayona so then really you should check out http://api.jqueryui.com/datepicker/#option-onSelect
[12:49:25] <robertmaxrees> look at the callbacks available.
[12:49:32] <Sayona> thanks
[12:50:40] <chrisml> taplar_lunch i added console logs for enter and leave, when i go slowly down from "find" it fires enter, then leave and enter when it hits the blue link
[12:51:14] <taplar_lunch> 'the blue link'?
[12:51:27] <chrisml> taplar_lunch "my trips"
[12:51:39] <taplar_lunch> right, cause you are leaving the hover area
[12:52:43] <taplar_lunch> which a border would emphasize where the hover area is
[12:52:46] <taplar_lunch> thus my suggestion
[12:53:18] <chrisml> ya i get that
[12:53:34] <chrisml> but my hover event is on the li, and the dropdown is in the li
[12:53:54] <chrisml> one sec i need to move the dropdown up
[12:54:12] <taplar_lunch> your hover event is on the div of menu-icon
[12:54:31] <taplar_lunch> from the jsbin you shared
[12:54:53] <chrisml> yeah, it's on .content for the blue links and .menu-icon for the top ones
[12:54:54] <chrisml> soryr
[12:55:46] <taplar_lunch> i don't see hover events for the content.  just for the menu-icon.  i'm only paying attention to the js events right now, not css driven events
[12:56:20] <chrisml> taplar_lunch you don't see this? $('#blue-navigation .content, .menu-icon')
[12:56:33] <taplar_lunch> ah, lol.  sorry
[12:56:52] <chrisml> lol, someone elses bad code... and it's hard putting a fiddle together with it
[12:57:40] <taplar_lunch> silly comma.  *keeps eating*  so anyway, the content hover is being allowed to happen because the menu-icon hover is not contiguous and with a z-index higher than the other elements
[12:58:00] <taplar_lunch> which are all more ##css issues
[12:58:12] <chrisml> i just tried the z-index as a first fix
[12:58:14] <chrisml> didnotwork
[12:58:27] <taplar_lunch> right, because of the contiguous issue
[13:00:06] <chrisml> taplar_lunch here is a better fiddle... so hover over find and then try and hit contacts http://jsbin.com/wofejofuwu/edit?html,css,js,console,output
[13:00:13] <chrisml> bin not fiddle lol
[13:00:27] <taplar_lunch> uh, you put the border on the wrong element
[13:00:32] <chrisml> :D
[13:00:42] <chrisml> but you see what i mean right
[13:01:51] <Sayona> is a way to get value from a dynamic input changed value?
[13:01:58] <taplar_lunch> did something change?  none of the hovers are working now
[13:02:10] <robertmaxrees> Sayona yes.
[13:02:22] <chrisml> taplar_lunch works for me :/
[13:02:25] <robertmaxrees> Sayona you get the value when the user selects a date.
[13:03:08] <Sayona> yes
[13:03:11] <Sayona> how?
[13:03:16] <robertmaxrees> Sayona the docs show you...
[13:03:32] <taplar_lunch> weird
[13:03:41] <robertmaxrees> alternatively, http://stackoverflow.com/a/11610866 Sayona
[13:04:10] <taplar_lunch> huh works in chrome, but for some reason my ffs just told me to go fk myself
[13:04:31] <Sayona> let me try
[13:05:00] <chrisml> taplar_lunch lol
[13:05:04] <chrisml> appreciate the help btw
[13:05:11] <taplar_lunch> ok, yes, there is still the contiguous issue
[13:05:16] <chrisml> how do i fix that
[13:05:23] <taplar_lunch> ##css
[13:05:36] <taplar_lunch> or #css i forget which
[13:05:42] <chrisml> ^
[13:05:49] <Sayona> input#datapublicare.hidden-val.hasDatepicker
[13:06:33] <Sayona> defaultValue

[13:25:23] <Sayona> ah, ....
[13:25:29] <Sayona> is the curent day ( f...)
[13:25:40] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:25:46] <robertmaxrees> you said you wanted the value of that input.
[13:25:51] <Sayona> I will tell my boyfriend good bye... becouse I want to die!
[13:25:59] <Sayona> robertmaxrees, yes
[13:26:34] <Sayona> I get with $("#datapublicare").val();
[13:26:46] <Sayona> but, how I find if this is changed ?
[13:27:10] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean?
[13:27:20] <robertmaxrees> like, you want to compare it to its original value?
[13:27:40] <Sayona> $("#datapublicare").val(); is updated if I click on the days in calendar
[13:27:57] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/11610866
[13:27:59] <robertmaxrees> with this.
[13:27:59] <Sayona> if i click 3 day :
[13:28:00] <Sayona> $("#datapublicare").val();
[13:28:00] <Sayona> "27.11.2016, 28.11.2016, 29.11.2016"
[13:28:00] <robertmaxrees> onSelect
[13:28:27] <Sayona> my data is display like "27.11.2016, 28.11.2016, 29.11.2016"
[13:28:59] <taplar_lunch> a fiddle would be awesome
[13:29:04] <robertmaxrees> i already tried.
[13:29:08] <taplar_lunch> heh
[13:29:14] <taplar_lunch> just reiterating
[13:29:16] <robertmaxrees> yeah....
[13:29:53] <Sayona> but i cannot reproduce...
[13:29:58] <robertmaxrees> huh>
[13:29:59] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[13:32:41] <Sayona> becouse not work https://jsfiddle.net/3x9whgx4/
[13:33:01] <robertmaxrees> because you don't have jqueyr or jqui included.
[13:33:02] <robertmaxrees> easy fix.
[13:33:35] <robertmaxrees> also need multiDatesPicker
[13:35:41] <Sayona> Input plain JavaScript code, no HTML.
[13:35:43] <Caspan> if ($('#InputBill').val() = '1') {}     i keep getting the following error when trying to evaluate this
[13:35:50] <Caspan> Main.js:123 Uncaught ReferenceError: Invalid left-hand side in assignment(
[13:35:57] <robertmaxrees> Caspan because you want ===
[13:35:59] <Caspan> any idea why?
[13:35:59] <Sayona> cannot insertInput plain JavaScript code, no HTML. <script src="
[13:36:01] <robertmaxrees> you're trying to se that value.
[13:36:06] <Caspan> ohhh
[13:36:16] <robertmaxrees> Sayona either way, you need to read docs and stuff.
[13:36:26] <robertmaxrees> you want to bind to whatever callbacks the plugin has.
[13:37:16] <taplar> Sayona: you don't include external js libraries in jsfiddle with script tags
[13:37:25] <taplar> there is an "External Resources" on the left hand side
[13:37:36] <Sayona> aaa thanks
[13:37:38] <Sayona> :*
[13:37:52] <taplar> and the "Javascript" label is clickable and has some options built in that you can select
[13:37:56] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:38:01] <taplar> such as for jquery
[13:41:18] <Sayona> not work https://jsfiddle.net/3x9whgx4/3/
[13:41:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:41:42] <robertmaxrees> you didn't include jquery first.
[13:41:43] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[13:42:57] <robertmaxrees> oh.
[13:43:06] <robertmaxrees> you don't have https setup for those scripts.
[13:43:12] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/3x9whgx4/4/
[13:43:22] <robertmaxrees> not gonna work in that case.
[13:43:46] <Sayona> :(
[13:44:13] <robertmaxrees> so where are you stuck?  the part where you grab the new value when it changes?
[13:44:30] <Sayona> yes
[13:44:34] <robertmaxrees> yeah.
[13:44:41] <robertmaxrees> so use onSelect or whatever callback it is.
[13:44:52] <Sayona> jquery $('#formm').append('<input type="hidden"  class="hidden-val" id="datapublicare" name="datapublicare" value="'+days+'" />');
[13:45:03] <Sayona> use this to change the value from that hidden input
[13:45:09] <Sayona> remove and add again
[13:45:16] <robertmaxrees> that's fine.
[13:45:22] <taplar> uh, no.  it's in a loop
[13:45:23] <robertmaxrees> though a little heavy-handed.
[13:45:33] <taplar> you can't repeat ids Sayona
[13:45:41] <Sayona> a?
[13:45:44] <Sayona> what? where
[13:45:53] <robertmaxrees> are you reusing that ID?
[13:45:54] <taplar> in that append
[13:46:03] <taplar> that append is in an each()
[13:46:13] <Sayona> yes
[13:46:16] <Sayona> and that is working
[13:46:20] <taplar> you cannot repeat ids
[13:46:22] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:46:25] <robertmaxrees> things will break.
[13:47:05] <Sayona> no dublicate in ids
[13:47:12] <Sayona> is only 1 id
[13:47:25] <robertmaxrees> either way, bind to the datepicker's "select" event or w/e
[13:47:27] <taplar> so you are saying your each() is only doing one iteration?
[13:47:46] <Sayona> yes
[13:47:53] <robertmaxrees> that's super weird.
[13:47:54] <taplar> so that's weird
[13:48:01] <Sayona> no know how the script work, becouse is made by my ex
[13:48:07] <robertmaxrees> but seriously.
[13:48:11] <robertmaxrees> backing up.
[13:48:18] <Sayona> tomorrow I will ask if he can help me
[13:48:33] <Sayona> i need to remove  id="datapublicare" ?
[13:48:44] <taplar> if this is something you are expected to maintain, it is important that you become familiar with it
[13:48:48] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:48:58] <robertmaxrees> you should know if that ID is getting reused, for instance.
[13:49:10] <Sayona> i remove it
[13:49:19] <robertmaxrees> and you should know how callbacks and things work.
[13:52:14] <Sayona> I do some nasty work
[13:52:15] <Sayona>  $('#formm').append('<div class="hidden-val">'+days+'</div>');
[13:52:17] <Sayona> and work
[13:52:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:52:34] <Sayona> after $('#formm').append('<input type="hidden"  class="hidden-val" id="datapublicare" name="datapublicare" value="'+days+'" />');
[13:52:34] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you just using your input?
[13:52:36] <Sayona> i just add that
[13:52:48] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:52:58] <Sayona> to create a <div> with that value?
[13:53:08] <robertmaxrees> why not use an input.
[13:53:09] <Sayona> and to append in a id
[13:53:12] <Sayona> no know how
[13:53:17] <Sayona> but why input?
[13:53:23] <robertmaxrees> because you want to store data.
[13:53:24] <Sayona> i need div
[13:53:30] <robertmaxrees> why?
[13:53:30] <robertmaxrees> lol
[13:53:32] <robertmaxrees> i'm so lost.
[13:53:34] <Sayona> :(
[13:53:37] <Sayona> :P
[13:53:39] <robertmaxrees> you set inputs using .val()
[13:53:41] <robertmaxrees> very easy.
[13:53:42] <Sayona> thanks
[13:53:56] <Sayona> thanks for helping me
[13:54:01] <Sayona> :**
[13:54:13] <Sayona> now i can create a input div etc
[13:54:14] <robertmaxrees> check out learn.jquery.com
[13:54:19] <robertmaxrees> "input div"
[13:54:19] <robertmaxrees> wat
[13:54:30] <robertmaxrees> you need to back WAAAAY up and learn some basics heh.
[13:55:21] <Sayona> suicide is more ok
[13:55:26] <robertmaxrees> woah what
[13:55:32] <robertmaxrees> suicide is never ok.
[13:55:35] <Sayona> I want to die!
[13:55:36] <taplar> dude, seriously.  that's not cool for this room, or in general
[13:57:47] <Sayona> :( ok
[13:58:57] <taplar> the intent of this room is to teach.  if you are showing issues with basic concepts, we will point you to resources that you can learn from.
[14:00:30] <taplar> the more you learn, the more you are empowered to find answers yourself.
[14:00:49] <Sayona> thanks

[14:07:33] <Left_09> robertmaxrees: it's fine for you?
[14:07:47] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/WhmQupY.png
[14:08:06] <taplar> a place that blocks jsfiddle?
[14:08:22] <Left_09> well damn robertmaxrees
[14:08:25] <taplar> and i thought i worked for hard asses
[14:08:47] <Left_09> i have really poor internet.. going to fiddle might kick me off
[14:09:10] <Left_09> robertmaxrees: why won;t it work for me
[14:09:18] <robertmaxrees> uh
[14:09:28] <robertmaxrees> i have literally no way of knowing without seeing it break.
[14:09:34] <taplar> what is 'tableBody'?
[14:09:37] <Left_09> 1 sec
[14:09:42] <Left_09> its a table
[14:09:48] <Left_09> 1 sec
[14:10:09] <robertmaxrees> and how does going to a website kick you off your connection?
[14:11:46] <Left_09> robertmaxrees: https://bpaste.net/show/eb171015d5bf
[14:12:07] <Left_09> only look at the script element
[14:12:08] <taplar> $("fruitsBody");  that's invalid
[14:12:12] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:12:13] <Left_09> oh
[14:12:37] <robertmaxrees> also: this has var row = $("<tr id='newrow'/>").appendTo(tableBody); inside an event handler.
[14:12:46] <robertmaxrees> meaning you'll add multiple elements with that ID - that's invlaid.
[14:12:48] <robertmaxrees> *invalid.
[14:12:57] <Left_09> oh i see
[14:13:03] <robertmaxrees> but yeah, fruitsBody should be #fruitsBody.
[14:13:21] <taplar> tag, #id, .class
[14:13:33] <Left_09> thanks let me fix it
[14:13:33] <taplar> same as css
[14:17:08] <Left_09> taplar: and robertmaxrees thanks a bunch it works now!
[14:46:22] <taplar> bah, i forgot to push out to my repo from my home box, :'(
[14:48:53] <robertmaxrees> that sucks.
[14:49:18] <taplar> heh, i was like why isn't my code working... nooooooooo
[14:51:10] <taplar> :s i just heard a football commentator refer to us as ar-kansas
[14:51:22] <robertmaxrees> i mean that's basically what you are.
[14:51:24] <robertmaxrees> right?
[14:51:28] <taplar> lol, no
[14:51:35] <robertmaxrees> the pirate kansas.
[14:51:52] <taplar> lmao
[14:56:19] <taplar> arrrrkansas, we love booty
[14:56:24] <robertmaxrees> yarr
[15:08:01] <l33n> sorry, meant to put this here: this is not working, i am getting an ReferenceError: Can't find variable: key error https://gist.github.com/anonymous/559a22ce316a712a1f1d4f3206be0cfb
[15:08:25] <robertmaxrees> on what line?

[15:08:59] <taplar> var key = data[key];
[15:09:01] <taplar> don't man
[15:09:09] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:09:13] <l33n> ok
[15:09:15] <robertmaxrees> that's asking for pain.
[15:09:26] <taplar> make your variable names more explicit as to what they are
[15:11:24] <l33n> i don't know what's going on though, in the console, i tried putting in data, and it says can't find variable
[15:11:45] <taplar> that's not a global variable
[15:11:48] <robertmaxrees> ^
[15:11:52] <robertmaxrees> only exists in that callback.
[15:11:52] <taplar> it's used in that callback, and then thrown away

[15:14:40] <Sayona> see ? is what I need
[15:14:44] <Sayona> onSelect
[15:14:49] <robertmaxrees> hrm?
[15:14:59] <Sayona> i debug every with console.log
[15:15:07] <Sayona> and i solve
[15:15:12] <Sayona> take a look in img

[15:18:48] <l33n> ReferenceError: Can't find variable: data line 32
[15:19:15] <robertmaxrees> document.getElementById("hydrants-found").innerHTML = data[key] + " hydrants found";
[15:19:19] <robertmaxrees> doesn't exist globally.
[15:19:25] <robertmaxrees> data only exists in that callback.
[15:19:33] <l33n> ok, but as for the other error
[15:19:38] <taplar> and data[key] is an object
[15:20:07] <l33n> fudge i mean data[key].id
[15:20:14] <l33n> no
[15:20:32] <l33n> how to specify its value?
[15:20:43] <taplar> what value?
[15:20:43] <l33n> data[key].val?
[15:20:52] <l33n> the key
[15:20:57] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:21:06] <taplar> data[key] is an object with it's own keys and values
[15:21:13] <taplar> you have to reference those sub keys
[15:21:23] <taplar> like you are above that line
[15:22:18] <taplar> i'm suspecting though it should just be 'key' on those lines
[15:22:24] <l33n> how to reference the key itself that points to the the object data[key]
[15:22:33] <taplar> lol
[15:22:38] <taplar> dude
[15:22:41] <l33n> what?
[15:22:44] <robertmaxrees> "how to reference the key itself"?
[15:22:45] <robertmaxrees> key
[15:23:09] <l33n> the key should be 1, 2, 3 respectively
[15:23:11] <l33n> right?
[15:23:15] <taplar> yes
[15:23:21] <taplar> which a console.log could tell you
[15:23:59] <taplar> here you get this link too http://fixingthesejquery.com/#slide1
[15:24:34] <l33n> console says, ReferenceError: Can't find variable: key
[15:24:38] <l33n> when i type in key
[15:24:40] <taplar> wait same guy
[15:24:47] <taplar> read that site man
[15:25:00] <l33n> ok
[15:25:32] <l33n> but for some reasonit can't find the variable key

[16:38:24] <taplar> my_tr.find(...)
[16:38:32] <vlt> taplar: Thank you! :-)
[16:40:21] <taplar> side note, $('#my_id') works just as well, :)
[16:46:02] <RonaldsMazitis> hi
[16:46:11] <taplar> aloha
[16:46:19] <RonaldsMazitis> why jqplot doesn't take my data from javascript https://jsfiddle.net/dc44Lwt0/2/
[16:47:54] <taplar> you don't have jquery or jqplot included in that fiddle
[16:48:45] <RonaldsMazitis> yes
[16:49:00] <taplar> can you fix that?
[16:49:19] <RonaldsMazitis> https://jsfiddle.net/dc44Lwt0/3/
[16:51:18] <RonaldsMazitis> var data = <?php echo $data; ?> works
[16:51:46] <RonaldsMazitis> sorry var data = [<?php echo $data; ?>];
[16:52:17] <taplar> what is $data?
[16:53:10] <RonaldsMazitis> that was just example
[16:53:20] <taplar> lol, that doesn't tell me anything man
[16:53:45] <RonaldsMazitis> console.log(output); outputs same values that the method
[16:53:51] <RonaldsMazitis> I just gave
[16:54:10] <RonaldsMazitis> there is commentaries in my code
[16:54:49] <taplar> i have no familiarity with jqplot, and i have no idea what your 'data' is.
[16:55:04] <taplar> and your fiddle is still not including jqplot
[16:55:28] <RonaldsMazitis> ['2016-11-25 14:38:14', 7],['2016-11-25 21:15:46', 8],
[16:55:38] <RonaldsMazitis> for example
[16:56:24] <RonaldsMazitis> main problem is that jqplot thinks it's string, when I try to insert value from ajax call
[16:56:53] <RonaldsMazitis> but array from this method ['2016-11-25 14:38:14', 7],['2016-11-25 21:15:46', 8],
[16:56:53] <taplar> it would be a string, unless it is parsed first
[16:56:56] <RonaldsMazitis> ups
[16:57:03] <RonaldsMazitis>  var data = [<?php echo $data; ?>];
[16:57:16] <taplar> console.log(typeof data);
[16:59:26] <RonaldsMazitis> https://jsfiddle.net/dc44Lwt0/5/
[16:59:53] <taplar> typeof is a built in method of javascript
[17:00:11] <taplar> just run that console log and see what it says
[17:00:36] <RonaldsMazitis> string
[17:00:45] <taplar> so it's a string
[17:00:58] <taplar> you'll have to parse it
[17:01:01] <RonaldsMazitis> converting to multiple arrays seem impossible
[17:01:07] <taplar> JSON.parse(data)
[17:01:55] <RonaldsMazitis>  Unexpected end of JSON input
[17:02:14] <taplar> so it's not a valid json string
[17:02:31] <taplar> you'll have to fix your endpoint to return a correctly formatted json string
[17:04:04] <snover> nitpicking here, but typeof is not a method, it is a language construct
[17:05:49] <taplar> where do you draw the line?
[17:05:55] <taplar> ^ asking
[17:06:09] <RonaldsMazitis> Unexpected token ' in JSON at position 3
[17:06:34] <RonaldsMazitis> ['2016-11-26 00:05:46', 1]
[17:06:40] <RonaldsMazitis> how it should look
[17:07:01] <taplar> RonaldsMazitis: what backend language are you using?
[17:07:08] <RonaldsMazitis> php
[17:07:17] <taplar> are you returning the result with json_encode() ?
[17:07:34] <taplar> if not, you should do so
[17:08:13] <vlt> taplar: I know. I just tried to make clear what Iâ€™m actually doing here ;-)
[17:08:38] <taplar> vlt: that's cool
[17:08:57] <RonaldsMazitis> now I do taplar
[17:08:59] <RonaldsMazitis> "['2016-11-26 00:05:46', 1],""['2016-11-26 00:08:42', 2],"
[17:09:01] <taplar> my point was more towards there isn't really a reason to include the tag with the id lookup
[17:09:03] <RonaldsMazitis> how it looks
[17:09:58] <taplar> RonaldsMazitis: are you doing json_encode multiple times?
[17:10:15] <RonaldsMazitis> no, I just have multiple arrays
[17:10:28] <taplar> that looks like you are doing it multiple times
[17:10:32] <taplar> because that is invalid json
[17:10:42] <taplar> and json_encode() would not do that
[17:10:48] <RonaldsMazitis> I just have to add "  to make it json?
[17:10:52] <taplar> no
[17:10:53] <taplar> lol
[17:10:54] <taplar> dude
[17:11:17] <taplar> you create your result as an (associative) array, one singe array, and you run that through json_encode() and return that string
[17:11:57] <taplar> the structure of json is that there must be a single parent element to all things at the very top
[17:12:52] <taplar> if you have questions about this you can hit up ##php for more information
[17:13:06] <RonaldsMazitis> "['2016-11-26 00:05:46', 1],['2016-11-26 00:08:42', 2],"
[17:13:09] <RonaldsMazitis> like this?
[17:14:08] <taplar> ask ##php man.  if you use json_encode once and that is all you return, you don't have to worry about it being in the valid format.  it will be.  you should not be constructing a json string yourself
[17:14:37] <NoiseEee> RonaldsMazitis: there is never a case for making JSON yourself, ever
[17:15:13] <NoiseEee> RonaldsMazitis: if you have something on the PHP side that you want to send to javascript, just json_encode() it.
[17:16:06] <RonaldsMazitis> but what is different
[17:16:20] <RonaldsMazitis> how javascript will know it's json
[17:16:34] <taplar> JSON.parse() will try to parse it
[17:16:40] <taplar> -it- knows the correct format
[17:16:56] <RonaldsMazitis> "['2016-11-26 00:05:46', 1],['2016-11-26 00:08:42', 2],"
[17:17:01] <taplar> which that is not
[17:17:20] <NoiseEee> RonaldsMazitis: instead of "var data = [<?php echo $data; ?>];"    you do  "var data = [<?php echo json_encode($data); ?>];
[17:17:48] <taplar> that looks weird too
[17:17:54] <RonaldsMazitis> Noisee I'm doing ajax call not echoing
[17:18:02] <taplar> the outer [] look wrong
[17:18:09] <NoiseEee> yeah indeed taplar
[17:18:20] <NoiseEee> RonaldsMazitis: PHP is sending back the data ?
[17:18:28] <NoiseEee> RonaldsMazitis: for your "ajax" ?
[17:18:51] <RonaldsMazitis> post
[17:19:09] <RonaldsMazitis> https://jsfiddle.net/dc44Lwt0/5/
[17:19:19] <NoiseEee> RonaldsMazitis: are you making a call to a PHP page
[17:19:25] <RonaldsMazitis> yes
[17:19:41] <NoiseEee> RonaldsMazitis: then the PHP page has to json_encode any data you want JS to use.
[17:20:01] <RonaldsMazitis> I did
[17:20:02] <RonaldsMazitis> "['2016-11-26 00:05:46', 1],""['2016-11-26 00:08:42', 2],"
[17:20:06] <RonaldsMazitis> is output
[17:20:32] <NoiseEee> well you've messed up something somewhere
[17:20:37] <taplar> it looks like a loop
[17:20:41] <taplar> based on the inner ""
[17:20:57] <RonaldsMazitis> yes, elements are generated by while
[17:20:59] <taplar> please take this question to ##php about how you are building the result
[17:21:04] <NoiseEee> taplar: ^^
[17:21:11] <taplar> it is off topic for the room now
[17:21:12] <NoiseEee> er RonaldsMazitis ^^
[18:51:15] <taplar> 9 more minutes. ffffffffk
[18:51:24] <taplar> slow day
[19:25:10] <catbadger> hey guys.
[19:25:48] <catbadger> is htere a way to check for network hiccups etc? I've got a bug I can't reproduce without cutting script loads in the middle.
[19:26:04] <robertmaxrees> like, via js?
[19:29:54] <catbadger> wel yes
[19:30:42] <robertmaxrees> not particularly.
[19:38:54] <catbadger> dern tyvm
[19:38:58] <catbadger> :)
[19:39:03] <catbadger> your input is appreciated.
[19:57:07] <stan_man_can> if I'm doing a $.get() how do I defer until after that response has closed?
[19:57:29] <stan_man_can> i'm querying an API, it returns a string on success  but if it can't find the resource it returns a 404
[19:57:45] <robertmaxrees> you use the .then() callback.
[19:58:24] <stan_man_can> or should I be chainging .fail() ?
[19:58:27] <stan_man_can> chaining*
[19:58:41] <robertmaxrees> .then() - first arg is if it succeeds, second is if it fails.
[19:58:50] <robertmaxrees> done and fail work, but then is preferred.
[19:59:25] <stan_man_can> technically I'd like to do like
[19:59:30] <stan_man_can> success, fail, always
[19:59:59] <stan_man_can> or like
[20:00:01] <robertmaxrees> yeah so i would avoid that.  i'd pass the two args to .then() but have a third function you also call.
[20:00:06] <stan_man_can> success, fail, "finally"
[20:00:18] <robertmaxrees> one sec i'll show you what your code could look like.
[20:00:22] <stan_man_can> thanks
[20:02:32] <robertmaxrees> https://bpaste.net/show/eb2cd03f557b
[20:02:36] <robertmaxrees> pretty simple.
[20:04:08] <stan_man_can> o.O
[20:04:28] <robertmaxrees> there are methods to support what you want, but you really do want to favor .then() these days.
[20:05:01] <systemfault> jQuery didn't get .catch? :(
[20:05:20] <robertmaxrees> sure it did.
[20:05:25] <robertmaxrees> https://api.jquery.com/deferred.catch/
[20:05:28] <robertmaxrees> added in 3.0.
[20:05:41] <robertmaxrees> deferred.catch( fn ) is an alias to deferred.then( null, fn ). Read its page for more information.
[20:06:11] <systemfault> Great, so it mimics more closely the standard implementation
[20:06:27] <robertmaxrees> it's compliant now in 3.x
[20:08:13] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees, I don't quite follow how that works
[20:08:32] <robertmaxrees> .then() takes two arguments - a success handler and a fail handler.
[20:08:43] <stan_man_can> but I have to define it first?
[20:08:51] <robertmaxrees> nope, you can use anonymous functions.
[20:08:58] <robertmaxrees> i just prefer to defined them first.
[20:09:06] <robertmaxrees> since naming things is generally pretty helpful.
[20:09:36] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees, https://bpaste.net/show/82d11c208f77
[20:09:38] <stan_man_can> that's what I have right now
[20:10:01] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[20:10:16] <stan_man_can> that half works, but then I need to do the same assignment if it fails, but instead of = data; it needs to be = 'String'; and then after both of those have happened I need to call one more function
[20:10:18] <robertmaxrees> instead of passing that function there, you use .then() and pass it there.
[20:10:28] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:11:08] <stan_man_can> so I do $.get('url').then(success,fail) ?
[20:11:11] <robertmaxrees> boom.
[20:11:28] <stan_man_can> does data get passed into both?
[20:11:41] <robertmaxrees> err.
[20:11:48] <stan_man_can> or, success i guess
[20:11:49] <robertmaxrees> how would a 404 generate data?
[20:11:54] <stan_man_can> yeah yeah sorry
[20:11:54] <robertmaxrees> success does, yes.
[20:13:25] <stan_man_can> do I have to do that const declaration you pasted?
[20:13:40] <systemfault> Passing two handlers to .then is usually seen as a bad pattern.. be careful with that.
[20:13:43] <robertmaxrees> nope.  you could use var, let, etc.
[20:13:46] <robertmaxrees> it is?
[20:13:52] <robertmaxrees> got any reading on that?
[20:14:21] <robertmaxrees> stan_man_can you can use anonymous function like you are now, i just tend to avoid them.
[20:15:59] <stan_man_can> robertmaxrees, ah that seems to work
[20:16:06] <stan_man_can> thanks sorry i took so long to catch on
[20:16:28] <robertmaxrees> no big.  the learning center and the docs have a good amount of info for you on those fwiw.
[20:16:29] <stan_man_can> $.get('url').then(function(data){}, function(){});
[20:16:57] <systemfault> robertmaxrees: What happens if there's an error in your success handler? (If you google for promise anti-pattern, you'll probably find quite a few articles on that)
[20:16:58] <robertmaxrees> sure.  you can use .catch() instead of passing that second one to .then(), too.
[20:17:15] <robertmaxrees> systemfault how is that any different from what i posted though?
[20:18:07] <stan_man_can> systemfault, so then..... $.get('domain', function(data) {..success..}).catch(function() { ..404..}); ?
[20:18:23] <systemfault> stan_man_can: No, forget the callback as the second parameter to get.

[20:18:48] <robertmaxrees> mmm.
[20:18:53] <systemfault> You want $.get('domain').then(function(data) {}).catch(function(err) {});
[20:18:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm not sure i entirely agree with the premise, but ok.
[20:19:35] <systemfault> robertmaxrees $.get('domain').then(function(data) { throw new Error("Nobody can catch me!"); }, function(err) {});
[20:20:03] <robertmaxrees> right.
[20:20:06] <robertmaxrees> i functionally understand that.
[20:21:04] <robertmaxrees> i just disagree with the premise :) then again, i'm sure i'm wrong in there somewhere so i'll need to play with it.
