[01:55:50] <hellyeah> morning
[01:56:06] <hellyeah> i just wonder why uncompressed version and minified version exist
[01:56:21] <hellyeah> i mean what is the advantage of using minified version?
[01:58:57] <systemfault> uncompressed is for development... minified for production.
[01:59:07] <systemfault> The minified version is smaller.
[02:00:17] <hellyeah> ic
[02:10:33] <hellyeah> hey
[02:11:25] <hellyeah> is there a way in jquery datepicker for checking if all dates in spesific month is disabled. if i am able to disable dates i prefer to show next month
[02:11:45] <hellyeah> is it possible to do something like that?
[02:49:32] <Duikb00t> Has someone an idea what is wrong with this code? I get an error on length.
[02:49:40] <Duikb00t> https://www.pastery.net/ngjwyr/
[02:54:05] <Duikb00t> Fixed it by doing: https://www.pastery.net/gnvxap/
[03:29:25] <suexec> I'm back. jQuery Mobile. Why does this do nothing: http://pastebin.com/d8VfKYax ? Apache log shows that the page I request is fetched ... but no content is shown in "#main_content".. it's just empty
[03:31:34] <hellyeah> i am sorry i dont know about mobile xD
[03:34:51] <suexec> hellyeah, you're not alone. Internet is scattered with just inconsistent information left and right about this. Really disappointing :(
[03:36:03] <hellyeah> what about jquery mobile documentation?
[03:37:25] <suexec> Copied examples - still doesn't work
[03:37:36] <suexec> So I am guessing it's flawed
[03:37:53] <hellyeah> did you fiddle it?
[03:38:03] <hellyeah> which examples are you talking about
[03:38:07] <hellyeah> can you show me?
[03:38:21] <suexec> Bit hard to fiddle, because I am loading additional page .. not just div content
[03:38:29] <hellyeah> ic
[03:38:36] <hellyeah> hmm
[03:38:59] <hellyeah> can you use javascript template and load it until certain circumstances?
[03:39:08] <hellyeah> jquery has htmlParse method
[03:39:33] <hellyeah> but i dont know if your page something related with php
[03:39:51] <hellyeah> either way it may be possible to set a similar scenerio
[03:41:24] <suexec> I have managed to hack my own method, loading external pages using jQuery instead.. and it's working quite nicely .. but I am getting a scenario where it looks like I have residue DOM elements. I load one page that has a colorbox, and it works fine when I open it. If I go to a different page, then back to the colorbox page and open an image again, I have to "close" it twice..
[03:41:26] <suexec> Does that make sense ?
[03:42:56] <hellyeah> i am not really expert
[03:43:01] <hellyeah> did you check the console
[03:43:07] <hellyeah> it may not trigget event
[03:43:14] <hellyeah> "closing event"
[03:43:52] <hellyeah> suexec:  you can also try #web
[03:48:33] <hellyeah> datepicker has something for showing some text when it is open and hide it when it is closed?
[03:55:12] <anli> I was trying to set the location of an iframe var iframe_doc = $('iframe').contents(); and iframe_doc.location = "http://myhost/foo" (not the actual url), that did not work however, is that because of cross domain?
[04:11:57] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[04:40:14] <MrHyde> hello
[04:40:57] <MrHyde> just beginning with jquery ... I'm trying to change a div class background image randomly : http://pastebin.com/1bepJzmx
[04:41:07] <MrHyde> but I'm probably doing somethin wrong :/
[04:41:15] <MrHyde> if anyone has an idea ...
[04:41:28] <MrHyde> s/anyone/someone/
[04:41:28] <b-ot> Correction, <MrHyde> if someone has an idea ...
[04:52:15] <FilipNortic> MrHyde: try background-image instead of background
[04:54:38] <MrHyde> FilipNortic: nope same ... Does jquery create the css when it doesnt exist or does it just update the value ?
[04:56:24] <MrHyde> weird should be straightforward :/
[04:56:40] <MrHyde> or I really missed something
[04:59:35] <FilipNortic> MrHyde: did you remove the last ,
[05:00:06] <MrHyde> yes
[05:01:14] <MrHyde> I print with console.log a random image name and it works as I can see it
[05:02:03] <MrHyde> but it looks like it doesnt understant the concatenation of randomImage with the rest of the background attribute
[05:23:13] <YamakasY> hi guys
[05:23:52] <YamakasY> is it possible to not trigger some form.attr() from the cacheidentifier ?
[05:23:59] <YamakasY> *cache-identifier
[05:24:05] <YamakasY> so prevent it will do
[05:27:31] <FilipNortic> YamakasY: what problem are you trying to solve exactly?
[05:28:58] <YamakasY> some guy is adding a attribut foo = "1" to a form when he sees this-identifier in the cache
[05:29:07] <pmehta> Hi! I need assistance with fetching value from array
[05:29:40] <YamakasY> FilipNortic: when this form is submitted it's running some function which I want to avoid
[05:30:47] <pmehta> anyone? http://pastebin.com/vLR2NUEW
[05:31:08] <FilipNortic> YamakasY: well yo can do allmost anything in the $("form").submit() event
[05:31:28] <YamakasY> FilipNortic: true but than I first need to parse something from my php app to it :)
[05:32:02] <YamakasY> or post something, but as he just says static, OK it's 1 I'm kinda bound to that stupid default or other forms will fail
[05:35:12] <FilipNortic> well you can use it on just that form
[05:36:19] <pmehta> hi, need assistance with http://pastebin.com/vLR2NUEW
[05:36:22] <YamakasY> FilipNortic: yeah true but all jquery lightboxes so
[05:40:49] <YamakasY> FilipNortic: it's always nice when things are undocumented and thought for that just particular way... we need to be able to enable or disable things :D
[05:41:21] <kanzie> Im having a strange problem. If I issue a GET call to server from browser to login and then issue a GET call which requires me to have a session cookie it works. If I do the same procedure using $.ajax() it doesnt seem to recognize that I have a session cookie. What could cause this?
[05:48:07] <ravenzz> kanzie: http://lmgtfy.com/?q=jquery+ajax+session&l=1
[06:01:06] <MrHyde> any idea for my random image ? http://pastebin.com/1bepJzmx
[06:04:10] <itsgokul> when i do alert(file.type) it show binary/octet stream for pdf file why
[06:17:28] <frenkestien> Hi
[06:19:02] <frenkestien> Has anyone used jquery.validate.js?
[06:19:17] <konrados> MrHyde what's that "height":"100vh"? what is the "vh" unit :) ?
[06:19:28] <frenkestien> I was wondering if there could be a rule like if (this-is-seclected') { //then only apply this rule }
[06:30:07] <hellyeah> hey there
[06:30:12] <hellyeah> anyone around?
[07:12:36] <hellyeah> hey anyone around?
[07:17:07] <suexec> Yep
[07:17:20] <suexec> hellyeah, I managed to fix my problem
[07:17:31] <suexec> I ditched the whole jQuery mobile crap and wrote my own loader. Works like a charm now!
[07:18:29] <anli> nice :)
[07:18:37] <hellyeah> suexec:  how?
[07:18:49] <hellyeah> suexec:  good one
[07:18:54] <hellyeah> congrats
[07:19:09] <hellyeah> anli or suexec  do you know jquery datepicker?
[07:19:21] <anli> yes
[07:19:27] <anli> Its a friend of mine
[07:19:30] <anli> ;)
[07:19:44] <hellyeah> anli is there something like onshow or something
[07:19:47] <anli> I use it sometimes, you only have to put the class datepicker on a textbox, I think
[07:19:52] <anli> hm
[07:19:52] <hellyeah> there is onClose
[07:19:58] <anli> I think there is open
[07:20:00] <hellyeah> what i want to do is
[07:20:15] <hellyeah> show some text on a div when datepicker is open
[07:20:33] <hellyeah> and hide that div when i close the datepicker
[07:20:42] <hellyeah> you understand what my aim is
[07:20:49] <anli> onSelect was suggested in the page for the first search hit of googling "jquery datepicker events"
[07:20:57] <suexec> datepicker from jquery ui ?
[07:20:58] <anli> Would that make it?
[07:21:08] <hellyeah> jquery ui
[07:21:22] <hellyeah> anli:  no, because you have to select a date
[07:21:29] <anli> oh
[07:21:32] <anli> Sorry
[07:21:41] <suexec> hellyeah, I presume you open the datepicker on the click of something ? couldn't you simultaneously display the div  ?
[07:21:46] <hellyeah> just a sec
[07:21:52] <hellyeah> let me try to clarify issue
[07:22:51] <hellyeah> anli:  suexec  http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/nt4mtwr4/5/ cl,ck datepicker by pressing + pls
[07:22:52] <anli> Maybe you are out of luck, that event handler could be missing
[07:23:12] <hellyeah> and click input box you will see datepicker
[07:23:13] <suexec> hellyeah, could you use https://api.jqueryui.com/jquery.widget/ and bind additional events to it maybe?
[07:23:34] <hellyeah> calendar is in april right now
[07:24:03] <hellyeah> when i click input box and show calendar. Check the month and show the special holidays of that month in different div
[07:24:07] <hellyeah> does it make sense
[07:24:12] <hellyeah> i am looking suexec
[07:24:48] <suexec> Nothing happens in the fiddle
[07:25:02] <hellyeah> you mean bind an event
[07:25:13] <anli> I have problems accessing the DOM in an iframe of another domain, even if that page outputs the header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
[07:25:48] <anli> I tried to find a chrome extension that disables XSS security
[07:25:58] <anli> No luck
[07:26:33] <hellyeah> suexec:  http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/nt4mtwr4/4/,
[07:26:36] <hellyeah> suexec:  http://jsfiddle.net/hellyeah/nt4mtwr4/4/
[07:26:58] <hellyeah> it worked now
[07:28:23] <hellyeah> suexec:  still there?
[07:28:29] <suexec> hellyeah, yeah. looking at the fiddle
[07:29:12] <suexec> So .. you want some div with text to be visible as long as the datepicker is out ?
[07:29:59] <hellyeah> suexec:  you dont need to examine code
[07:30:08] <hellyeah> let me tell you what my issue is
[07:30:25] <hellyeah> when you create datepicker and click input box you will see datepicker right
[07:30:30] * hellyeah code is quiet long
[07:30:44] <hellyeah> and current month in the calendar is April = Nisan
[07:30:56] <suexec> Correct
[07:30:57] <hellyeah> every country has some holidays on April right
[07:31:16] <hellyeah> what i want to do is to show special holidays in a div when you open a calendar
[07:31:30] <hellyeah> let say the user change the month
[07:31:36] <hellyeah> it will show holiday of may
[07:31:42] <Sangeet> Hi People
[07:31:49] <hellyeah> and when user select a date div will be hidden
[07:31:54] <hellyeah> does it make sense to you_
[07:32:27] <hellyeah> jquery datepicker doesnt have spesific eevent for that
[07:33:17] <hellyeah> pls tell me if it doesnt make sense
[07:33:38] <suexec> Yes, makes sense
[07:33:55] <hellyeah> ah good
[07:34:05] <suexec> You want a trigger when the month is changed in the calendar .. and depending on what month, you want to perform an action
[07:34:25] <hellyeah> yes
[07:34:36] <hellyeah> actually
[07:34:43] <hellyeah> if calendar is open
[07:34:56] <hellyeah> check the month it can be may june july or whatever
[07:35:10] <hellyeah> do some action show some div with some spesiifc message
[07:35:39] <hellyeah> but jquery datepicker ui doesnt have that functionality
[07:36:26] <neo12> do you guys write tests for html?
[07:37:14] <anli> yes
[07:37:42] <neo12> i'm considering whether i should too
[07:37:45] <hellyeah> suexec:  do you have particular suggestion i am thining for awhile
[07:37:52] <suexec> hellyeah, let me do some checking mate
[07:37:52] <neo12> or to skip it
[07:38:07] <hellyeah> neo12:  why do you want to write html tester neo12
[07:38:14] <hellyeah> suexec:  thank you so much
[07:38:39] <neo12> seems a waste of time
[07:38:45] <neo12> i know
[07:40:52] <hellyeah> neo12:
[07:40:57] <hellyeah> i am kinda newbnie
[07:41:01] <hellyeah> just cariousity
[07:41:12] <hellyeah> you can use w3c validator if it helps
[07:45:39] <suexec> hellyeah, something like this https://jsfiddle.net/2pcapg6n/
[07:45:48] <suexec> Written for jQuery UI though
[07:45:52] <suexec> Not the widget thing you're using
[07:46:56] <suexec> hellyeah, https://jsfiddle.net/2pcapg6n/3/ <- small changes. Same concept.
[07:53:45] <hellyeah> let me check
[07:53:49] <hellyeah> thank you suexec
[07:54:02] <suexec> hellyeah, was that what you wanted ? :)
[07:56:34] <anli> I tried foo.find("#Login1$LoginButton"), which resulted in unrecognized expression, why?
[07:57:23] <jerit> .scrollTop() is used to scroll the view to the top of the selected element, correctly?
[07:57:45] <anli> Should be the amount of scroll
[07:58:06] <anli> Only a getter
[07:58:09] <jerit> so what if I wanted to scroll my view to the top of a particular element
[07:58:13] <anli> oh, wait also a setter
[07:58:20] <anli> try .scrollTop(0);
[07:58:37] <anli> oh, then you will need .scrollIntoView
[08:00:09] <anli> Cant an id contain $?
[08:01:37] <shoky_> anli you have to escape it in a selector with \\
[08:02:00] <anli> Is it reserved for something?
[08:02:11] <anli> Maybe I am asking without thinking now
[08:02:58] <anli> [href$=".jpg"]
[08:03:03] <shoky_> yes it's for characters with special meaning in css
[08:03:09] <anli> Thanks shoky_
[08:03:23] <shoky_> you have a list here at the top  https://api.jquery.com/category/selectors/
[08:03:37] <anli> nice
[08:06:32] <pmehta> Hi a array element returns --->  "[RecomendedTimeSlots:[activity_duration=null, activity_travel_time=null, availability=180, dayVal=Friday, dt=2016-05-06 00:00:00, quota=180, timeFormat=AM, timeSlots=08:00 - 10:00, workSkill=Elec2], RecomendedTimeSlots:[activity_duration=null, activity_travel_time=null, availability=360, dayVal=Friday, dt=2016-05-06 00:00:00, quota=360, timeFormat=AM, timeSlots=10:00 - 12:00, workSkill=Elec2]]"
[08:06:55] <pmehta> How do I fetch the value 'dayVal' and 'timeSlots'
[08:08:52] <hellyeah> suexec:  let me check i am sorry someone called me
[08:11:04] <hellyeah> suexec:  thanks that does the trick
[08:11:35] <suexec> hellyeah, awesome
[08:11:55] <pmehta> anyone?
[08:29:28] <hellyeah> suexec:  m === 5 the month is numbered. right
[08:29:31] <hellyeah> good one
[08:30:08] <hellyeah> is it 0 based?
[08:30:10] <suexec> hellyeah, yes, they are numbered. I don't know what the respective ones are, but that would be easy to find out. Do a console.log on "m" and see what they each output :)
[08:30:42] <hellyeah> setFullYear has m parameter also
[08:30:46] <hellyeah> begins with zero
[08:31:04] <hellyeah> but as far as i know datepicker' month is 1 based
[08:32:18] <hellyeah> anyway thank you so much
[08:32:25] <hellyeah> i will take care of it

[09:50:00] <fonko> hi guys
[09:50:02] <lepong> Hi out there! I'm having a problem where I have a bunch of existing divs on a page. I count the length via .length and everything looks right in the world. Then I do a .remove() … and count the length again. Same value. That's impossible right??
[09:50:19] <fonko> does anybody knows a plugin for pinch zoom and rotate images? i have been looking all around without luck
[09:50:29] <Z3R0> lepong: fiddle?
[09:52:35] <lepong> Z3R0 it's lots of code… I can reduce it… might help in debugging. But was initially curious if length operates on a the *current* DOM…
[09:52:50] <lepong> as opposed to the "original"
[10:04:48] <Z3R0> https://jsfiddle.net/1as344d8/ : lepong looks like it’s reading it just fine :)
[10:08:55] <lepong> Z3R0 ahhh. nice. that was fast! k. I must be doing something wrong in my code. thanks for the peace of mind knowing that it's reflecting *current* DOM
[10:09:10] <Z3R0> np goodluck
[10:09:13] <lepong> appreciate your help! Z3R0

[10:56:01] <notchris> How to wrap each span / a together in a div? https://jsfiddle.net/notchris/te7r1yyr/
[10:56:26] <Marco_Costa> Hey folks. Im a little confused about a simple selector I have. Im trying to select a input using $('input') but instead of return the dom element its return an object?! The object looks like this. http://pastebin.com/KK53DaSK
[10:56:48] <Marco_Costa> Its causing me issues because i am trying to bind a keypress to it. What could i be doing wrong?
[10:57:35] <decx> notchris: probably an each on the span
[10:57:47] <decx> then $(this).add($(this).next()).wrapAll('<div>')
[10:58:29] <notchris> decx: Ahhh clever
[11:00:25] <Marco_Costa> Maybe im losing my mind..

[11:11:09] <decx> why
[11:11:21] <jsNewbie> JSON.parse(a); gives me ncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token d(…)
[11:11:48] <jsNewbie> decx: need to use this as an object
[11:11:57] <decx> but why
[11:12:00] <decx> it's an array
[11:12:36] <jsNewbie> decx: It's a string I created by concatinating all those values, now I wish to convert into object
[11:13:05] <decx> that's ridiculous
[11:13:54] <jsNewbie> decx: I understand but is it possible to convert it into object?
[11:14:42] <decx> it's easy but it doesnt make sense
[11:14:54] <jsNewbie> decx: How?
[11:15:14] <decx> create object, add properties
[11:15:21] <decx> overthink the whole thing
[11:17:00] <jsNewbie> decx: elaborate a bit? apology

[13:42:20] <cryptomonk> Greetings, is there a way to define the CSS background color of a DataTables alternating row bgcolor and the highlight color?
[13:42:30] <cryptomonk> by default they look like VERY pale grey but almost invisible
[13:42:44] <cryptomonk> would like to darken them up. Using plain jquery, and plain DataTables CSS
[13:44:28] <cryptomonk> any tips or help is appreciated.  CSS/Javascript being the way it is, there are a million ways to do it.  But was hoping there was an Attribute you feed to the DataTables declaration that modified it's internal value.
[13:44:39] <cryptomonk> But not sure if the colors are coming from jquery, or the DataTables CSS
[13:45:12] <awkwardCough> are you wanting something like tr:nth-child(odd) { background: #ff0000;}
[13:45:49] <cryptomonk> yes
[13:45:58] <cryptomonk> but I want it ONLY for the DataTable not ALL tables
[13:46:19] <cryptomonk> and also the row highligh on mouseover color
[13:46:25] <ohcibi> what is a DataTable?
[13:46:31] <ohcibi> cryptomonk: ?

[13:46:50] <cryptomonk> a table plugin for jquery
[13:47:10] <ohcibi> cryptomonk: well... see if their tables have a specific class, if not add one and scope the nth-child rule to that class..
[13:47:20] <cryptomonk> have 0 clue how to do that
[13:47:29] <ohcibi> cryptomonk: back to css!
[13:48:22] <cryptomonk> God I hate CSS/JAvascript... there has to be a better more defined way of doing things UI-wise on the web
[13:48:33] <cryptomonk> X11 programming was easier than learning this stuff
[13:48:47] <cryptomonk> ./done venting :)
[13:49:39] <ohcibi> cryptomonk: youre wrong. css is actually the easiest way to define ui-stuff.. its so powerful, that other ui-tools outside the web have adopted it
[13:50:26] <ohcibi> cryptomonk: specifically for your problem: css has the ability to define rules for elements that only live inside specific other elements since the beginning
[13:50:28] <cryptomonk> will accept that
[13:51:03] <cryptomonk> so I need to create a new CSS class,  set the nth-child in that class.   Then tell my <table class="newclass"> ?
[13:51:39] <ohcibi> cryptomonk: just checkout the data-table in the developer tools first.. i dont know of any jquery-plugin that is not applying a specific class to its elements
[13:51:58] <cryptomonk> part of my confusion is that Im using bootstrap which has it's own CSS,  DataTables has it's own CSS, and jquery has it's own CSS (believe)
[13:52:10] <ohcibi> cryptomonk: jquery hasnt
[13:52:14] <ohcibi> jquery-ui has
[13:52:18] <ohcibi> but only if you include it
[13:52:23] <cryptomonk> ah have that too for my datapicker
[13:52:35] <ohcibi> cryptomonk: if you would help if you'd read the basics about css
[13:52:38] <ohcibi> its not complicated at all
[13:52:46] <ohcibi> *it would help
[13:52:49] <cryptomonk> ty
[13:55:02] <ohcibi> cryptomonk: and to conclude: this is not an issue of #jquery at all.. this purely css-related.. you actually want to know how to apply style rules for elements that live inside specific elements and how to put elements in such specific elements and how to address/select them then if they are not
[13:57:12] <awkwardCough> cryptomonk: https://jsfiddle.net/1s04snbd/ and http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/sel_nth-child.asp but onchibi is right, this is a #css thing
[14:33:36] <jqdev> hello
[14:33:42] <jqdev> i need your help
[14:34:15] <jqdev> i want to replace the letter after the "-" with an uppercase
[14:34:21] <jqdev> my code is : $('#compte_prenom').val()[$('#compte_prenom').val().indexOf('-')+1].toUpperCase();
[14:34:35] <jqdev> but it's not working
[14:35:18] <jqdev> can you help me to fix this
[15:06:36] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/ermtuxge/
[15:37:19] <yottabyte> might be a css question, but how can I pick a <p> with a certain class? and how can I pick a <p> that has a certain number of classes but no others? say <p class='a'> and <p class='a b'>
[15:37:34] <Guest54388> join /php
[15:37:39] <robertmaxrees> p.a
[15:37:41] <robertmaxrees> p.a.b
[15:37:41] <robertmaxrees> etc
[15:37:43] <Guest54388> JOIN /PHP
[15:38:00] <robertmaxrees> Guest54388 it's /join #php
[15:38:16] <robertmaxrees> though it'll be ##php, and you need to register first.
[15:38:22] <yottabyte> thanks
[15:38:42] <yottabyte> robertmaxrees: what are those called?
[15:38:48] <yottabyte> like p.a.b
[15:38:58] <robertmaxrees> that's a selector
[15:39:00] <robertmaxrees> p for tag.
[15:39:02] <robertmaxrees> .a is a class.
[15:39:12] <robertmaxrees> no spaces means you want the element with tagname p and classes a and b.
[15:39:14] <robertmaxrees> p.a.b
[15:39:24] <robertmaxrees> span.foo
[15:39:25] <robertmaxrees> etc.
[15:40:41] <yottabyte> right, class selectors I think is the word https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Class_selectors
[15:40:50] <yottabyte> so .a and p.a are both class selectors?
[15:40:55] <robertmaxrees> no.
[15:40:59] <robertmaxrees> .a is a class selector.
[15:41:11] <robertmaxrees> p.a (or span.foo) would be a selector that uses a tag and a class.
[15:41:19] <yottabyte> ah
[15:46:31] <z1haze> how do i do just lik the old fashion onClick="confirm" with jquery?
[15:46:40] <robertmaxrees> you use .on()
[15:47:00] <z1haze> hmm
[15:47:16] <robertmaxrees> .on('click', function() { window.confirm('is this awesome?'); });
[15:47:25] <z1haze> im using sweet alert, and i want to just havea confirm box thats not the default, which i have working, i just dont know how to finish the request if its confirmed
[15:47:38] <z1haze> because i have to preventDefault
[15:47:39] <robertmaxrees> you check the value of the window.confirm.
[15:47:44] <z1haze> then i dont know which iam
[15:47:50] <z1haze> i just dont know how to carry through
[15:47:52] <z1haze> i dont want to use ajax
[15:48:05] <robertmaxrees> you're using a normal form?
[15:48:08] <z1haze> yea
[15:48:13] <robertmaxrees> show youre code then.
[15:48:17] <z1haze> sure
[15:48:17] <robertmaxrees> *you
[15:48:26] <robertmaxrees> ffff you know what i mean.  i cannot type today.
[15:49:15] <z1haze> actually you know what
[15:49:22] <z1haze> ill just use ajax and refresh the page
[15:49:27] <robertmaxrees> wut
[15:49:33] <robertmaxrees> literally no reason to do that.  but ok.
[15:49:38] <z1haze> well yea
[15:49:43] <z1haze> i just dont wanna worry about updating the dom
[15:49:55] <robertmaxrees> errr
[15:50:04] <robertmaxrees> the entire reason you use ajax is so you don't have to refresh the page.
[15:50:11] <z1haze> yea i know
[15:50:12] <robertmaxrees> don't use ajax just to reload the page later anyway.
[15:50:15] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't make sense.
[15:50:16] <z1haze> but i dont actually havea 'form' per say
[15:50:24] <z1haze> just a link
[15:50:25] <robertmaxrees> then make one.
[15:50:39] <robertmaxrees> so you want to know if you should follow a link?
[15:50:39] <z1haze> i guess i could
[15:50:53] <z1haze> no it have to be a post request, i guess ill make a form
[15:50:57] <z1haze> has*
[15:51:04] <robertmaxrees> heh then yeah, you'd need a form for that.
[15:51:25] <z1haze> i usually just use ajax and update the dom but for this cause i really dont care
[15:51:38] <robertmaxrees> sure.  no reason to use ajax here.
[15:52:14] <z1haze> being sarcastic?
[15:52:22] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[15:52:33] <z1haze> haha then how do you know
[15:52:43] <robertmaxrees> huh?>
[15:52:47] <z1haze> sure.  no reason to use ajax here.
[15:52:53] <robertmaxrees> you're going to reload the page.
[15:52:54] <z1haze> that was just a strange thing to say
[15:52:56] <z1haze> ohh
[15:52:56] <robertmaxrees> no need to use ajax.
[15:52:57] <z1haze> ok
[15:53:01] <z1haze> right gotcha xD

[16:41:35] <km4> I have in this array label lang, value etc informations
[16:41:40] <taplar> console.log( theVariable.element[0] );
[16:42:25] <Sindhura> I have to call a dialog box within a tab control. It works fine if I use " $("#tabs").tabs();" but when I use "$("#tabs").tabs({ active: hash });" it throws an error "Object doesn't support property or method 'dialog'"
[16:44:11] <Sindhura> I have to call a dialog box within a tab control. It works fine if I use " $("#tabs").tabs();" but when I use "$("#tabs").tabs({ active: hash });" it throws an error "Object doesn't support property or method 'dialog'"
[16:44:37] <taplar> what is 'hash'?
[16:44:43] <Sindhura> index
[16:45:26] <Sindhura> I have 5 tab items I want to open 3rd based on some condition.
[16:45:36] <taplar> k.  i don't see where your using dialog though.
[16:45:44] <taplar> can you make a fiddle showing the issue?
[16:45:59] <Sindhura> I don't know if I will be able to paste the whole code here
[16:46:14] <taplar> jsfiddle.net
[16:47:32] <Sindhura> Let me explain in details. When I use this "$("#tabs").tabs();" and click on the 3rd item I can open a dialog box without errors. But if I load the 3rd items directly using  $("#tabs").tabs({ active: hash }); it throws error
[16:47:59] <taplar> and your initializing the dialog before doing that?
[16:48:25] <Sindhura> no I am intializing and opening it on a button click in 3rd tab item
[16:49:09] <taplar> yeah i'd need to see a fiddle
[16:49:37] <Sindhura> I am sorry I am new to the chat. where can I paste code ?
[16:49:56] <taplar> jsfiddle.net
[16:51:14] <noregret> anybody using datatables?
[17:02:24] <km4> this internet connection ;/
[17:09:42] <Sindhura> I am finding it difficult to duplicate the scenario on js fiddle as multiple files are involved. could you please suggest
[17:11:14] <Sindhura> Tabs.cshtml :-   <div id="tabs">     <ul>         <li><a href="~/Document/Index1">Tab1</a></li>         <li><a href="~/Document/Index2">Tab2</a></li>          <li><a href="~/Document/Index">Documents</a></li>         <li><a href="~/Document/Index4">Tab4</a></li>         <li><a href="~/Document/Index5">Tab5</a></li>                <li><a href="~/Document/Index6">Tab6</a></li>            </ul>    </div>

[17:14:29] <Sindhura> https://jsfiddle.net/axpv9zvu/8/#&togetherjs=7FcAVquHie
[17:16:15] <Sindhura> help
[17:16:40] <Sindhura> https://jsfiddle.net/axpv9zvu/8/#&togetherjs=7FcAVquHie
[17:19:12] <robertmaxrees> aaaah together js.
[17:19:37] <robertmaxrees> what do you need, Sindhura?
[17:19:48] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/axpv9zvu/10/ what's the issue?
[17:20:58] <Sindhura> I have the Edit button and dialog div in a different page
[17:21:24] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[17:21:37] <taplar> so your pulling that code in with ajax?
[17:21:41] <Sindhura> when I click on edit button it gives the error " "0x800a01b6 - JavaScript runtime error: Object doesn't support property or method 'dialog'
[17:21:59] <Sindhura> No I just redirect
[17:22:06] <robertmaxrees> err.
[17:22:09] <robertmaxrees> it has to be on that page.
[17:22:13] <Sindhura>  <li><a href="@Url/Docket/Index">Events</a></li>
[17:22:13] <robertmaxrees> you can't go across pages like that,
[17:22:46] <Sindhura> but it works totally fine if I just use " $("#tabs").tabs();"
[17:23:44] <Sindhura> Error comes only after I add " $("#tabs").tabs("option","active", 3);"
[17:24:25] <robertmaxrees> but the error is "Object doesn't support property or method 'dialog'"?
[17:24:39] <Sindhura> yeah.. That's the problem ...
[17:24:50] <Sindhura> I am not able to understand how this line is affecting
[17:24:50] <robertmaxrees> then " $("#tabs").tabs("option","active", 3);" should be a problem.
[17:24:58] <Sindhura> I tried every possible thing I can
[17:25:29] <Sindhura> yeah but I have to open 3rd tab based on some condition.. 1st tab by default
[17:25:46] <robertmaxrees> err, *shouldn't
[17:26:40] <robertmaxrees> so you're trying to run .dialog() on somethign that isn't on the page?
[17:26:42] <Sindhura> If I comment the  $("#tabs").tabs("option","active", 3); this line code works as expected
[17:26:58] <robertmaxrees> console.log() the selector for the dialog then.
[17:27:50] <Sindhura> tabs control is on page dialog is on other.. dialog is in the 3rd item of my tab.. In 3rd tab item der is a edit button on click of that I have to load my dialog.
[17:28:15] <robertmaxrees> so the dialog doesn't exist on the page yet?
[17:28:34] <Sindhura> no on button click dialog opens
[17:28:50] <robertmaxrees> i mean the thing you rung .dialog() against.
[17:29:02] <Sindhura> sorry ?
[17:29:16] <robertmaxrees> $("#dialog")
[17:29:20] <robertmaxrees> does that exist on pageload?
[17:29:38] <Sindhura> that is in the same page where button edit is der...
[17:29:59] <robertmaxrees> then something isn't adding up here.
[17:30:03] <Sindhura> its a div it does exist..
[17:30:33] <Sindhura> yeah I tried to compare the view source but there is no difference
[17:30:40] <robertmaxrees> view source isn't what you want.
[17:30:41] <robertmaxrees> inspector is.
[17:30:43] <Sindhura> I tried to see if any js file is loading twice
[17:30:44] <Sindhura> but no
[17:31:10] <Sindhura> I meant .. I tried to see all possible things I can.
[17:36:54] <noregret> anybody using datatables?
[17:36:59] <robertmaxrees> lots of people are.
[17:37:04] <robertmaxrees> if you have a question, just ask :)
[17:37:17] <robertmaxrees> if somebody can help, they will, though you're much more likely to get help via their forums.
[17:42:51] <WhirledPress> .sindhura, how are you calling the .dialog() method?
[17:48:22] <km4> how can display this data-foo grr https://jsfiddle.net/0qkhpsoq/3/
[17:49:18] <taplar> huh?
[17:50:31] <km4> I try to display my own img in this example https://select2.github.io/examples.html#templating
[17:51:14] <km4> but I will try to add data-img in the options and add on the script
[17:59:15] <km4> https://jsfiddle.net/0qkhpsoq/4/ somethings like this but need display data-img url in this $foo
[18:00:09] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/0qkhpsoq/5/
[18:45:43] <PersianMG> Hey is there a way I can call a function on a <span class="someclass">blah</span> as soon as it is created?
[18:45:57] <robertmaxrees> call it from the function that creates it.
[18:46:07] <PersianMG> No function creates it, its html
[18:46:19] <robertmaxrees> then just run your code?
[18:46:22] <robertmaxrees> in a dom ready?
[18:46:24] <PersianMG> Using $(window).load(function(){ at the moment but it adds a delay
[18:46:32] <robertmaxrees> yeah, use a document ready instead.
[18:46:36] <PersianMG> ah okay
[18:47:44] <PersianMG> robertmaxrees: Thanks working great
[18:47:53] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[19:27:11] <guest271314> How did jQuery team run Promises/A+ Compliance Test Suite described at http://blog.jquery.com/2016/01/14/jquery-3-0-beta-released/ ? Cannot reproduce
[19:27:53] <robertmaxrees> maybe they made adapters.
[19:28:47] <robertmaxrees> yep
[19:28:47] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/test/promises_aplus_adapter.js
[19:29:42] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees Ok, will try that
[19:30:07] <robertmaxrees> wonder if the unit tests run that as apart of their funk.
[19:30:45] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees Is it ok to post link to stackoverflow here?
[19:30:57] <robertmaxrees> sure, though i'm kind of confused.
[19:31:03] <robertmaxrees> did you have a question?
[19:32:21] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees See http://stackoverflow.com/q/36438228/, http://chat.stackoverflow.com/rooms/108948/discussion-between-jared-smith-and-guest271314
[19:32:43] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/a/36557989
[19:33:56] <robertmaxrees> i'm curious to know why you're looking to run the jquery unit tests yourself.
[19:34:08] <neanderslob> hi everyone, I often find myself using the combination .closest(x).find(y) an awful lot as a way of finding the closest element of a certain type; is there a jquery function that combines these two?  (not critical, just wondering)
[19:34:17] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[19:34:47] <robertmaxrees> neanderslob i usually "cache" the parent selector and then run a bunch of .find()s against that.
[19:35:03] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: heh, that was definitive; thanks for clearing that up for me!
[19:35:15] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees To verify jQuery.Deferred is now Promises/A+ compatible  jQuery.Deferred objects have been updated for compatibility with Promises/A+ and ES2015 Promises, verified with the Promises/A+ Compliance Test Suite. See also https://github.com/jquery/jquery/issues/2152#issuecomment-209145105
[19:35:48] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: yea, that's usually what I do as well, if I'm using the same parent to find an element over and over again
[19:36:02] <neanderslob> robertmaxrees: thanks again
[19:37:26] <robertmaxrees> guest271314 the jquery team has already done that for you.
[19:37:34] <robertmaxrees> the unit tests probably already do that.
[19:39:23] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees QUnit tests use deferred.js by @mgol, not Promise/A+ compliance tests
[19:39:41] <robertmaxrees> are you implying that the team is lying, then?
[19:39:41] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:40:36] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees No, do not imply anything , here. Would simply say so. Saying could not reproduce the results described, so far
[19:41:29] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees Why not post entire procedure in detail at GitHub, or other site?
[19:42:05] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/055cb7534e2dcf7ee8ad145be83cb2d74b5331c7/build/tasks/promises_aplus_tests.js
[19:42:09] <robertmaxrees> because it's all in the source coide.
[19:43:12] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees How to run the tests? Especially for a user of jQuery that may not be well-versed in nodejs?
[19:43:29] <robertmaxrees> http://stackoverflow.com/questions/36438228/how-to-test-if-jquery-3-0-beta-is-promises-a-compatible-in-browser/36557989#36557989
[19:43:42] <robertmaxrees> like, there are tons of resources out there that'll show you how to do that.
[19:45:14] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees Tried that approach, with that adapter, returned fail for every test. Have been searches for resources for a few days now, without success. Can you create a list detailing the approach to reproduce tests successfully and post as a gist?
[19:45:27] <robertmaxrees> i don't really have time to do that.
[19:45:52] <robertmaxrees> i see you opened a bug with the jquery team.
[19:46:07] <robertmaxrees> good luck then :)
[19:46:10] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees Ok. Will try the adapter link that you posted. Ideally would prefer to run tests without nodejs. Yes, opended bug
[19:46:23] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:46:26] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to use node.
[19:46:32] <robertmaxrees> that's how most people run unit tests these days.
[19:47:53] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:48:09] <robertmaxrees> looks like you're getting help in that chat room then.
[19:51:08] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees Yes, attempting to solve issue. Just tried adapter, returned no results
[19:55:02] <Side_FX> Does anyone know why I would be getting [Object Object] returned on an ajax call when the .php just returns plain text?
[19:56:37] <robertmaxrees> show us what you're doing.

[19:58:58] <robertmaxrees> i'd maybe hit up #jquery-dev
[19:59:08] <robertmaxrees> though you're getting a little spammy at this poinbt.
[19:59:39] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees No, not "spammy". Attempting to solve an issue by asking questions.
[19:59:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[19:59:58] <robertmaxrees> enjoy duder.
[20:00:31] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees Would avoid chat altogether if resources were available detailing how to reproduce successful tests. Cheers
[20:01:26] <robertmaxrees> lol
[20:02:06] <Side_FX> robertmaxrees thanks
[20:03:13] <guest271314> @timmywil How to reproduce successful tests?
[20:03:27] <robertmaxrees> tkae it to #jquery-dev please :)
[20:04:17] <guest271314> @robertmaxrees Ok.
[20:04:18] <shoky_> Side_FX: the "complete" callback gets different arguments than the success/done callback
[20:04:40] <shoky_> Side_FX: the first argument is the jqXHR request object.
[20:04:57] <shoky_> or well, just use success
[20:05:11] <Side_FX> Success didn't work, I switched it complete and it worked.
[20:05:18] <shoky_> ..
[20:05:24] <shoky_> success works fine
[20:05:24] <shoky_> :)
[20:05:27] <Side_FX> I Think maybe cause it's doing a file upload so it can't return right away?
[20:05:33] <shoky_> no
[20:06:06] <Side_FX> It was calling the php but nothing in the success function was running.
[20:06:08] <shoky_> though, complete will get called even if there is an error.
[20:06:17] <shoky_> so maybe there's an error. add an error handler too
[20:06:52] <shoky_> though you said "it worked" which i have no idea what you mean since you said you're having trouble getting the response data...
