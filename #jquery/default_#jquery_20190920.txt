[00:58:30] <kiwi_79> can you help me with : https://jsfiddle.net/o8L1qxvr/1/ ?? justtrying to improve code
[00:58:56] <robertmaxrees> start by deleting all the commented out stuff.
[00:59:02] <robertmaxrees> no need to keep commented out code.
[01:01:48] <robertmaxrees> and use jsfiddle correctly.
[01:02:36] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/3urdLjbg/
[01:03:46] <kiwi_79> ok
[01:04:19] <kiwi_79> im not sure why promises are good here and how to use it
[01:05:20] <robertmaxrees> as far as the "how" - at the most basic level: https://jsfiddle.net/8z4neb7p/
[01:05:43] <robertmaxrees> as for the "why" - promises get away from callback hell where you nest functions multiple levels deep.
[01:06:02] <robertmaxrees> instead, you pass around the async operation itself and just bind your handlers as necessary.
[01:06:33] <kiwi_79> do all post request still run async?
[01:06:48] <robertmaxrees> yes.  $.post() is just $.ajax() with some defaults set.
[01:08:33] <robertmaxrees> this won't work, but let's say you wanted to do something after all your ajax calls finished: https://jsfiddle.net/8z4neb7p/1/
[01:08:52] <kiwi_79> i read this atm: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1060539/parallel-asynchronous-ajax-requests-using-jquery
[01:09:27] <kiwi_79> and saw ParallelAjaxExecuter
[01:09:28] <kiwi_79> example
[01:09:33] <robertmaxrees> whoops that should be https://jsfiddle.net/8z4neb7p/2/
[01:09:35] <kiwi_79> what do you think about that one?
[01:10:02] <robertmaxrees> that's an extremely antiquated example.
[01:10:24] <robertmaxrees> did you even look at what I just did?
[01:10:56] <kiwi_79> yeah im reading it
[01:11:00] <kiwi_79> thanks btw
[01:11:19] <robertmaxrees> jquery has stuff built in to do exactly what you need :)
[01:11:39] <kiwi_79> the displayed_data i still need right?
[01:11:46] <kiwi_79> to append the responses?
[01:11:54] <robertmaxrees> i'ma be honest and say that I didn't even really look at the original code.
[01:12:00] <robertmaxrees> let's back waaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy up.
[01:12:17] <robertmaxrees> because you're super hung up on implementation details without understanding the underlying tools.
[01:13:25] <robertmaxrees> so take a second and consider your original request.
[01:13:40] <robertmaxrees> you want to do something when all ajax calls successfully finish, right?
[01:14:51] <kiwi_79> yes display
[01:15:54] <robertmaxrees> so you use when() for that - $.when.apply($, theArrayOfAjaxCalls).then(function(anArrayWithAllTheResolveValues) { /* your code here */});
[01:21:00] <kiwi_79> thats what $.when.apply($, allAjaxCalls).then(function(data) { does
[01:21:47] <robertmaxrees> Yep!  you'll need to fix that callback since data in that case is an array of all the responses from all the ajax calls.
[01:23:24] <kiwi_79> that catches success per default?
[01:23:35] <kiwi_79> otherwize it gets into catch(function(req, status, err) { ?
[01:23:46] <robertmaxrees> "per default"?
[01:23:59] <robertmaxrees> you mean for each call?
[01:24:16] <kiwi_79> before i defined success callback
[01:24:19] <kiwi_79> but i dont see it any more
[01:24:35] <robertmaxrees> right.
[01:24:38] <robertmaxrees> because you don't need it.
[01:24:50] <robertmaxrees> that .when() runs when all of the ajax calls have finished.
[01:24:53] <kiwi_79> interesting
[01:25:10] <robertmaxrees> if one of them fails, then it goes to the .catch() and nothing in that .then() runs.
[01:26:41] <robertmaxrees> Read up on promises for more info.
[01:28:11] <kiwi_79> yeah
[01:28:28] <kiwi_79> but we dont use them now?
[01:28:36] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:28:43] <robertmaxrees> We don't use promises?
[01:29:55] <kiwi_79> i mean: Promise.all(promises).then(...);
[01:30:11] <robertmaxrees> lol
[01:30:18] <robertmaxrees> when, then, and catch are all promise methods.
[01:30:27] <robertmaxrees> jquery implements promises for you.
[01:30:49] <kiwi_79> i read about it i promise :)
[01:33:39] <kiwi_79> one thing i notice is that currUrl
[01:33:46] <kiwi_79> is not available in $.when.apply($, allAjaxCalls).then(function(data) {
[01:33:58] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[01:34:20] <kiwi_79> $.when.apply($, allAjaxCalls).then(function(data) { .... displayed_data += "<b>" + currUrl + "</b>"; ... }
[01:34:39] <kiwi_79> but currUrl is in allAjaxCalls
[01:34:49] <robertmaxrees> you'll need to refactor things to make that work.
[01:34:57] <kiwi_79> in the map function :)
[01:35:34] <kiwi_79> i need to pass it to the callback somehow?
[01:35:45] <robertmaxrees> so first off.
[01:35:58] <robertmaxrees> since you're using promises, they're not callbacks any more.
[01:36:07] <kiwi_79> yes
[01:36:25] <robertmaxrees> and second off, you'll need to rethink your strategy.  you might need to define your own deferred to give you the results you want.
[01:37:25] <kiwi_79> ok will do tmr :)  need some rest first
[01:37:32] <kiwi_79> thank u so far
[02:43:14] <Megna> Hi. Which website layouts are used for gaming sites?
[02:44:05] <Megna> https://worldofwarcraft.com what website layout it uses?
[02:55:01] <Woet> Megna: Blizzard made $7.5 billion USD last year, I think they can afford a designer or two
[02:56:35] <Woet> also, there's no need to ask all the related IRC channels.
[02:57:06] <Megna> I'm in desperate for answer
[02:57:10] <Megna> so did so
[02:57:49] <Woet> then I recommend asking an useful question
[02:58:26] <Megna> So did .
[03:00:04] <Woet> what is your actual question?
[03:00:30] <Megna> I want to know what website layouts are best suited for gaming sites?
[03:00:46] <Woet> whatever you like?
[03:01:17] <Megna> I think we have some types of layouts ?
[03:01:50] <Megna> grid layout , zig zag, f ,single page, etc
[03:02:15] <Megna> Magazine Layout
[03:02:26] <Megna>  Modular Layout
[03:02:40] <Megna> Split Screen Layout
[03:02:59] <Megna> My question was related to this
[03:03:09] <Woet> whatever you like.
[03:03:33] <Megna> Okay
[03:03:40] <Megna> got you !
[03:04:00] <Megna> https://worldofwarcraft.com
[03:04:15] <Megna> by seeing this website, which layouts comes in your mind ?
[03:04:27] <Megna> it is completely different from all
[03:04:29] <Megna> ?
[03:04:34] <Woet> why do you want to know?
[03:04:37] <Woet> are we doing your homework?
[03:05:01] <Megna> is it kind of homework to you ?
[03:06:20] <Woet> it seems like a homework question rather than an actual question to achieve something, yes
[03:07:19] <Megna> I'm finding out the type of layout using some website links
[03:07:43] <Megna> to make myself understand the types of layouts
[03:08:17] <Megna> This question can't be my whole homework .
[03:08:34] <Megna> Thank you for responding Woet
[03:34:18] <deepy> Megna: carousels are all the rage in gaming website design
[03:34:35] <deepy> the more carousels the more people will think gaming
[03:46:03] <paule32> hello, and good morning
[03:46:15] <paule32> i have a json array:  var favorite_apps = { "_class" : "my_web", "_isOpen": false };
[03:46:47] <paule32> how can i add a tmp_array with the same form to favorite_apps ?
[03:47:08] <paule32> i tried favorite_apps.push(tmp_array);
[03:47:25] <paule32> but i get the error message, that push ist not a function
[03:56:50] <Dane34> Hello everyone. Sorry to bother you with this question if you receive it all the time. I've looked at the forums and can't seem to find an answer. I've been trying to roll my own jqueryui, but cloudflare keeps saying that the gateway is bad. Is this a common thing?
[03:58:57] <Cork> donno how alive jquery-ui is now days to be honest
[04:01:16] <Dane34> Oh, that's a shame
[04:02:03] <Cork> not saying it is, i just haven't seen any jquery-ui activity for ages
[04:02:20] <Cork> (note ui, not core jquery)
[04:04:14] <Cork> Dane34: you can still download the default themes from code.jquery.com though
[04:04:34] <Cork> or rather here http://code.jquery.com/ui/
[04:04:45] <Cork> you just can't use the helpers for the color adjustments
[04:05:21] <Dane34> Thanks Cork :)
[04:05:39] <Cork> donno if i would pick a dependency that is this level of dead for a new project though
[04:08:50] <Dane34> Good tip
[04:09:00] <Dane34> I'll look at other options! :)
[06:37:55] <mr_lou> So I'm having this old problem: https://forum.jquery.com/topic/ajax-sending-textarea-val-with-line-breaks-included
[06:38:52] <mr_lou> $.get("somephpfile.php?textareavalue="+sometext).....  as stated on that page, the new lines in the textarea aren't sent. Why?
[06:41:01] <mr_lou> https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/9131941d-232b-4592-9b13-c0348cf2a83d/how-can-i-send-data-containing-line-break-n-in-jquery-ajax?forum=scripting
[06:41:20] <mr_lou> Not finding answers. Only more people with the same experience.
[07:03:23] <paule32> hello
[07:03:40] <paule32> i have an empty array:   var foo = [];
[07:04:19] <paule32> then in code, i did:  if ($.isPlainObject(foo) == false) { /* i can exec commands here */ }
[07:04:34] <paule32> foo should be empty ?
[07:05:05] <Cork> paule32: no, cause the constructor is Array not Object
[07:05:21] <Cork> object is {} not []
[07:06:13] <paule32> so, i shall   foo = [{}] ;  ?
[07:06:17] <Cork> mr_lou: you can't add textareas in a get query
[07:06:46] <Cork> paule32: you could do $.isPlainObject(foo[0]) if you do sure
[07:06:55] <Cork> but i don't think that is what you want
[07:07:17] <Cork> so, instead of trying to get isPlainObject do what you want, ask how to do what you're trying to do instead
[07:07:59] <paule32> my itention is, to check, if foo = []; is empty, is it, then add_json_item, else change json_item
[07:08:00] <Cork> (classic, ask the right question)
[07:08:26] <Cork> that would be foo.length > 0
[07:09:07] <Cork> note you don't do foo[something] with arrays that is again objects
[07:09:15] <Cork> (when you set the value)
[07:10:50] <mr_lou> Cork, Oh.... so....  post?
[07:11:11] <mr_lou> For now I just did a replace prior to sending. Works.
[07:11:24] <Cork> mr_lou: if you want to send data to the server; you SHOULD use post or patch or put
[07:11:35] <Cork> mr_lou: get is for getting data, _NEVER_ changing server data
[07:11:48] <Cork> caches will break if you try to do that
[07:13:01] <Cork> (get isn't guaranteed to actually reach the server)
[07:13:44] <Cork> mr_lou: also urls can't contain multiple lines, so that is actaully the core problem with what you're currently doing
[07:41:40] <paule32> hello
[07:42:01] <paule32> is that the correct way, to delete an json array object: http://dpaste.com/2Y6ZWK9
[07:42:02] <paule32> ?
[07:48:48] <Cork> you mean remove a value from an array?
[07:48:57] <Cork> json == string
[07:49:38] <Cork> to inject or remove values from an array you use splice https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice
[07:54:47] <paule32> ah ok, thx
[08:04:13] <JuJUBee> I am adding selection lists based on previous selection using ajax.  How do I attach the js on("change"...) to it?
[08:15:43] <Cork> JuJUBee: you most likely want to delegate https://api.jquery.com/on/#on-events-selector-data-handler
[08:16:26] <Cork> also https://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[08:26:41] <paule32> hello
[08:27:01] <paule32> does .splice(0,1); remove the first item ?
[08:28:26] <Cork> yup
[08:28:50] <Cork> indexes are zero based in js after all
[09:29:08] <crs> Cork: Hey. :)
[10:46:50] <paule32> hello
[10:47:01] <paule32> i have this code snippet:  http://dpaste.com/25SRXGG
[10:47:30] <paule32> on top of paste: there is some html stuff, other jquery
[10:48:11] <paule32> the problem is, that, when i minimize the easyui window, button is show always on the bottom
[10:48:26] <paule32> but bot into #taskbar
[10:57:54] <paule32> i have set float:left
[10:58:30] <paule32> that put me the elements - the first on left, but the second under the element 1
[11:41:21] <paule32> hello
[11:41:23] <paule32> http://dpaste.com/1TTK2P5
[11:41:33] <paule32> what is wrong with this code?
[11:41:47] <paule32> especialy lines 57...
[11:42:22] <paule32> there are tabs, but i can't switch between these three tabs
[11:42:33] <paule32> all other should be ok
[11:42:41] <paule32> some ideas?
[11:58:30] <kiwi_79> hi
[18:19:11] <paule32> hello
[18:19:36] <paule32> i have this piece of code:  http://dpaste.com/1NXHPHX
[18:19:58] <paule32> i have a canvas with with/height 500px
[18:20:15] <paule32> but the window/div is displayed smaller
[18:20:41] <paule32> so i get  a scrollbar at left and bottom side of div
[18:20:43] <robertmaxrees> are you able to make a minimal test case?
[18:32:52] <paule32> robertmaxrees: https://jsfiddle.net/afr8pnou/4/
[18:33:08] <paule32> you can see the scroll bars?
[18:33:14] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[18:33:57] <robertmaxrees> https://i.imgur.com/iS1WOeK.png
[18:34:35] <robertmaxrees> where is your specific issue?
[18:37:24] <paule32> http://i.imgur.com/M024lP0.png
[18:37:38] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[18:37:42] <paule32> to bigger i make the canvas, to bigger is the window
[18:37:54] <robertmaxrees> not seeing the issue in the fiddle..
[18:38:02] <robertmaxrees> what are you building??
[18:38:20] <paule32> application
[18:38:23] <robertmaxrees> lmao
[18:38:33] <robertmaxrees> nvm.
[18:38:47] <robertmaxrees> as far as your issue, looks related to whatever framework you're using.
[18:39:04] <paule32> easyui
[18:39:14] <paule32> the pixels are from me
[18:39:16] <robertmaxrees> that looks like your issue then (shrug)
[20:24:43] <kiwi_79> hi
[20:26:58] <kiwi_79> still need help with https://jsfiddle.net/9f8pzL4g/ :D
[20:27:23] <kiwi_79> hos to get currUrl and i into $.when.apply ?
[20:50:17] <shoky> kiwi_79: first of all, the url should be available on the jqXHR object, which should be one of the arguments of the success/when callback. `data` will be an array of the 3 arguments
[20:51:32] <shoky> kiwi_79: otherwise you could do something like  return $.post(...).then((data) => ({data, currUrl, i}));
[20:52:14] <kiwi_79> just replace return $.post with return $.post(...).then((data) => ({data, currUrl, i})); ?
[20:52:48] <shoky> kiwi_79: yes. then the `data` you get in the $.when callback will be that object
[20:53:01] <kiwi_79> let me try
[20:55:44] <kiwi_79> how to access i and currUrl in $.when.apply  ?
[20:55:51] <kiwi_79> using $.i and $.currURl ?
[20:56:25] <shoky> kiwi_79:  console.log(data)
[20:56:45] <shoky> not $.something .. it's not on the jquery namespace
[20:56:49] <shoky> it's on `data`
[20:57:06] <kiwi_79>                     return $.post({                        url: currUrl,                        data: JSON.stringify(jsonData),                    }).then((data) => ({data, currUrl, i}));
[20:57:09] <kiwi_79> oh
[20:57:34] <kiwi_79> return $.post({url: currUrl, data: JSON.stringify(jsonData),}).then((data) => ({data, currUrl, i}));   ??
[20:57:56] <shoky> yes
[20:58:41] <shoky> also if you have multiple requests, then you'll have multiple arguments to the $.when callback
[20:59:04] <kiwi_79> multiple arguments?
[20:59:17] <shoky> yes. multiple requests -> multiple responses ;p
[20:59:24] <kiwi_79> i need currUrl and i for the related post request which was sent
[20:59:30] <shoky> you will get that
[20:59:45] <shoky> each argument will be an object with .data .currUrl .i
[20:59:46] <kiwi_79> $.when.apply will be called multiple times?
[20:59:48] <shoky> no.
[21:00:02] <kiwi_79> oh
[21:00:14] <kiwi_79> but i want each call to return when finshed
[21:00:24] <kiwi_79> and not wait for all responses to be finished
[21:00:34] <shoky> $.when waits for all
[21:00:46] <kiwi_79> oh thats not what i wanted ,,... hm
[21:01:02] <kiwi_79> i want to send the request and when the first one returns...profcess it
[21:01:08] <kiwi_79> requests
[21:01:25] <kiwi_79> how to achive that?
[21:01:30] <shoky> then use a regular success/then callback to the $.post
[21:01:38] <shoky> not $.when
[21:01:44] <kiwi_79> hm
[21:01:46] <shoky> handle each request separately
[21:01:59] <shoky> assuming that's what you really want..
[21:03:05] <kiwi_79> shoky like that? https://jsfiddle.net/2dvy0eLj/
[21:03:54] <shoky> yes. i prefer a .then() over `success` but it's the same thing
[21:04:13] <shoky> i.e.  $.post(...).then(function(data) { ... })
[21:06:00] <kiwi_79> can you show syntax?
[21:06:03] <kiwi_79> for then
[21:06:07] <shoky> i just did.. ;)
[21:06:38] <kiwi_79> is i and currUrl the or of the received response?
[21:06:48] <shoky> what?
[21:07:13] <kiwi_79> $.post({url: currUrl, data: JSON.stringify(jsonData),}.then(function(data) { console.log("received data from:", currUrl, i); ... }
[21:07:26] <kiwi_79> like that?
[21:07:28] <shoky> missing a )   but yes
[21:07:45] <kiwi_79> where is ) missing?
[21:07:53] <shoky> i'll let you figure that out
[21:07:54] <kiwi_79> from the post?
[21:08:16] <shoky> you don't need me for a missing )   , i hope
[21:09:16] <kiwi_79> the then is called for each response right?
[21:09:29] <shoky> ya
[21:25:04] <robertmaxrees> you could also do both - if you need to do an action after all of them finish, for instance.
[21:30:38] <kiwi_79> shoky i changed it to: https://jsfiddle.net/9f8pzL4g/1/
[21:30:50] <kiwi_79> robertmaxrees hi, what you mean by both?
[21:34:11] <kiwi_79> shoky $.currUrl is undefined in }).then(function(data) {
[21:34:41] <kiwi_79> as well as i
[21:41:06] <kiwi_79> shoky do you know what i mean?
[21:54:07] <kiwi_79> ?
[21:54:09] <kiwi_79> hm
[22:40:32] <shoky> [03:56:32] <shoky> kiwi_79:  console.log(data)
[22:40:32] <shoky> [03:56:52] <shoky> not $.something .. it's not on the jquery namespace
[22:40:32] <shoky> [03:56:56] <shoky> it's on `data`
[22:41:06] <kiwi_79> same for i?
[22:41:18] <shoky> why would it be on $ ?
[22:41:40] <shoky> $ has jquery functions. not your variables :p
[22:42:16] <kiwi_79> yes
[22:42:20] <shoky> kiwi_79: ah i forgot you're not using $.when anymore
[22:42:31] <shoky> kiwi_79: you can just access currUrl and i
[22:42:34] <shoky> not on $.
[22:42:44] <shoky> they are in scope in your .then callback
[22:42:46] <kiwi_79> ok, how often will it call the them part?
[22:42:50] <shoky> huh?
[22:52:41] <kiwi_79> shoky i looked at i, it printed 3,4 and not 1,2 which is kinda weired
[22:55:44] <kiwi_79> are the requests still async?
[22:55:53] <shoky> kiwi_79: of course. ajax is async
[22:56:03] <shoky> that's the first 'a' :p
[22:58:11] <kiwi_79> i send request to x1 than x2 ... it also possible i get response x2 before x1?
[22:58:38] <kiwi_79> does that reflect in the variable i, currUrl within the  }).then(function(data) { ?
[22:59:06] <shoky> yes it's possible. responses come whenever they are ready
[22:59:31] <kiwi_79> so the currUrl and i i read inside the }).then(function(data) { block reflect that?
[22:59:33] <shoky> i, currUrl will be the correct ones for the specific request
[22:59:43] <kiwi_79> why request?
[22:59:47] <kiwi_79> i mean response
[23:00:00] <shoky> each request has a response, sure..
[23:00:14] <shoky> the url is of the request..
[23:00:18] <shoky> doesn't matter.
[23:00:32] <kiwi_79> i send request to x1 than x2 ... so response x2 is before x1 ... the first time .then(function(data) i = 2, currUrl = ..x2 ?
[23:00:37] <shoky> yes
[23:00:49] <kiwi_79> ok
[23:04:11] <kiwi_79> shoky fixed it, it seems to work... any other things i need to consider here? https://jsfiddle.net/9f8pzL4g/2/
