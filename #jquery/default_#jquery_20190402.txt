[01:56:45] <Sidd> Can someone explain this code to me :   http://jsfiddle.net/4tbrn1c6/
[01:57:30] <Sidd> http://jsfiddle.net/2fw80teu/
[02:40:11] <Cork> Sidd: what part of it?
[02:42:01] <Sidd> @Cork : getting NaN error
[02:47:59] <Sidd> Cork : How to validate if enter text is number or not ?
[02:52:17] <Cork> Sidd: you don't have any "amound" value
[02:52:21] <Cork> or time for that matter
[02:52:35] <Cork> so calculate is broken
[02:53:11] <Cork> but about numbers js converts strings to numbers when it is used in number equations
[02:53:22] <Cork> (so you don't need to do anything for that)
[02:54:54] <Sidd> Cork : okay
[02:55:50] <Sidd> Cork : any correction to get amount value?
[02:56:07] <Cork> Sidd: match the argument variable name with equation variable names
[02:58:39] <Sidd> Cork : I didn't get you
[02:58:56] <Cork> Sidd: check the argument variable names in the declaration of the calculate function
[02:59:04] <Cork> and check what names you use in the equation
[02:59:09] <Cork> they don't match
[02:59:27] <Sidd> Cork : okay
[05:06:03] <Histogun> hello room
[05:07:28] <Histogun> i have a probleme with memory leak domnode
[05:08:11] <Histogun> a newsticker jquery script, call a php to echo a result with ajax every 40sec
[05:08:36] <Histogun> i do empty() and remove() in a setintervall for cleaning domnode
[05:13:10] <Cork> Histogun: never call http in a setInterval
[05:13:31] <Cork> use make a setTimeout and then a new setTimeout in a done callback
[05:13:48] <Cork> else you can end up with multiple calls at the same time if the call takes time to complete
[05:14:09] <Cork> also make sure you don't store references to the old dom elements, else they will never be removed
[05:49:13] <Histogun>  Cork thank you for the replay, can you see that please : https://jsfiddle.net/p8m6bu2f/
[06:02:48] <Histogun>  Cork : i changed setinterval to setTimeout
[07:06:33] <Cork> Histogun: the js is missing
[07:48:56] <Histogun>  Cork: use this link : https://intranet.algerian-radio.dz/home.php
[12:42:13] <MikeD_> is there a jquery deferred equivalent of promise.all() ?
[12:42:34] <robertmaxrees> http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[12:42:35] <robertmaxrees> but also:
[12:42:54] <robertmaxrees> Promise.all() works with jquery deferreds,since they're promises :)
[12:45:28] <robertmaxrees> MikeD_
[12:47:11] <MikeD_> i've used $.when.apply( {}, myarray ) in the past, so is that the trick that's now just use Promise.all ?
[12:50:10] <robertmaxrees> totally depends.
[12:50:24] <robertmaxrees> if you're in jquery land i'd stick to $.when.apply
[12:50:55] <MikeD_> :)  and that's the sensible advice i was looking for instead of googling on my own :)
[12:51:01] <robertmaxrees> lol
[12:51:14] <robertmaxrees> also: i'd favor $.when.apply($, thearray);
[12:51:21] <robertmaxrees> passing $ as the first arg.
[13:21:13] <MikeD_> hmm... for why?  (was afk)
[13:21:52] <robertmaxrees> retains the correct 'this' if that's important to you :)
[13:22:01] <MikeD_> ok, cool
[13:30:59] <smart_ptr> Does anyone have an idea what purpose this /#/ folder serves? >> https://mystartup.com/app/#/onboarding
[13:31:13] <robertmaxrees> that's not an actual folder :)
[13:31:23] <robertmaxrees> that's a hash
[13:34:44] <smart_ptr> is this proper HTML, then?
[13:34:58] <smart_ptr> or can you just insert /###/#/######/ as you like without any impact and meaning?
[13:35:52] <robertmaxrees> errr, huh?
[13:36:02] <smart_ptr> why is the URL like this?
[13:36:19] <robertmaxrees> it's so you can include extra data for the client-side
[13:36:30] <robertmaxrees> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLHyperlinkElementUtils/hash
[13:36:50] <robertmaxrees> you can use to, for instance, link to a particular ID on a pager
[13:36:52] <robertmaxrees> *page
[13:37:16] <robertmaxrees> some people use it as something they can dynamically update without reloading the page.
[13:37:39] <robertmaxrees> so the user can deep link into a part of your SPA, for instance.
[13:38:10] <robertmaxrees> note that the hash doesn't get sent as apart of the request to the server, so your backend won't see it.
[13:38:52] <robertmaxrees> why do you ask? :)
[13:40:17] <smart_ptr> I just came across it and got really curious ;D
[13:40:37] <robertmaxrees> alright
[13:40:49] <smart_ptr> Seeing it in the "middle" of an url
[13:41:02] <robertmaxrees> right, so it's actually the end of the URL
[13:41:06] <smart_ptr> I thought it's part of the folders, because I didn't think having "/" as part of the name is weird
[13:41:07] <robertmaxrees> anything after # is apart of the hash
[13:41:12] <smart_ptr> yes haha ;D
[13:41:17] <smart_ptr> it fooled me ;D
[13:41:45] <robertmaxrees> 'k
[14:30:01] <arooni> FYI- I also use my functions.php file to load jQuery.. deregister Wordpress's jQuery and register your specific version of choice from google cdn. And specify it to load in the footer. At least i have come to learn this is a best practice.
[14:30:19] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[14:30:21] <arooni> err my question rather is if thats still a good practice, that post i found was from 2012
[14:30:30] <arooni> i.e. loading jquery in the footer via google's cdn
[14:30:32] <robertmaxrees> depends on a whole lot of factors.
[14:30:51] <robertmaxrees> google's cdn may or may not be an actual benefit.
[14:31:04] <arooni> id think they'd load stuff faster than my puny $10/mo vps
[14:31:20] <robertmaxrees> the file is small enough and compression is real enough that it's arguable :)
[14:31:26] <robertmaxrees> that's just first load, as well.
[14:31:36] <arooni> thats a good point it would be cached
[14:34:57] <arooni> apparently it took 434 ms to load jquery for my site
[14:35:31] <arooni> oops i had the wrong file ; 183ms
[15:01:27] <makr8100> arooni: just a suggestion, I'd avoid a generically named "functions.php"
[15:01:50] <makr8100> it may sound ridiculous it takes me 4 files to output jquery, but it makes sense once you start adding libraries, etc.

[16:34:20] <robertmaxrees> weeeeeeeeee
[19:17:28] <coolternet> guys... i have a job for anyone. Need a tool in jquery easy to use and xtrem friendly-user. Anyone can refer me a jq dev ?
[19:26:45] <pavonia> What kind of tool?
[19:29:47] <dumo> I know I can attach data using .data(), but can I select for a specific key-value pair?
[19:30:55] <dumo> The docs I read in UI mention being able to select for elements with data on a given key but not the value
[19:31:47] <dumo> also, hi
[19:35:40] <pavonia> You can use .filter for this
[19:39:30] <pavonia> Err wait, there's of course also the "[attr=value]" selector
[19:39:46] <coolternet> FormBuilder in JQ/AJAX for save in JSON format. Its for E-Commerce (products template field)
[19:40:28] <dumo> so, select.jbstat[prev='New']
[19:40:54] <dumo> or is that select.jbstat.data([prev='New])
[19:41:33] <coolternet> pavonia: i need a formbuilder with some field and option like (text field, text area, select, option and divider)
[19:41:57] <pavonia> dumo: $("[prev='New']") when the attribute is called "prev", otherwise "data-pref"
[19:49:48] <dumo> pavonia: https://jsfiddle.net/gm3h0dxq/
[19:50:02] <dumo> this doesn't seem to fire
[19:51:07] <dumo> there's another event that populates the select elements with their current values as soon as they gain focus and it logs that value to the console
[19:51:50] <dumo> https://jsfiddle.net/gm3h0dxq/1/
[19:55:24] <dumo> if there were a way to make a selector that only applied to selects whose CURRENT value is 'New' before the change that would be swell but I don't see a working example of that
[19:55:54] <dumo> oh and just to make things more fun these are OPTION elements with no explicit VALUE attributes
[19:58:59] <pavonia> dumo: "prev" and .data("prev") are two different things. the latter attribute is called "data-prev"
[19:59:46] <dumo> we're still talking about values assigned via .data() and not HTML5 data- attributes, right
[20:01:32] <pavonia> Isn't it the same unter the hood?
[20:01:41] <dumo> ahhhh
[20:04:09] <pavonia> Actually, I'm not sure if your can select values attached by .data("foo") via a [data-foo] selector
[20:05:16] <dumo> thanks, I have to run home now but you were helpful
[21:24:05] <fkl> https://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxscheduler/index.htm#demos/jqxscheduler/
[21:25:46] <fkl> Is there a way to disable all dates/times except for those I define to be available for scheduling?
