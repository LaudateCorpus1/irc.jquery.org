[03:11:20] <orionshock> o/  question -- im trying to use $.each() and it's just returning the object passed as the first arg and not even bothering to run the function i pass it - any ideas?
[03:15:10] <pavonia> Not without seeing the actual code
[03:34:37] <orionshock> ok, im trying to use $.each() and it's just returning the object passed as the first arg and not even bothering to run the function i pass it - any ideas? -- https://jsbin.com/tiviwibito/edit?html,js,console  this time with code
[03:45:51] <pavonia> orionshock: It works if you initialize the result variable as "import_Materials_Current = { };". I'm not sure how indexing arrays with strings is defined in JS, but semantically it's wrong, you have to use an object instead
[03:46:37] <orionshock> well fk me - that worked
[03:46:42] <orionshock> :) thanks pavonia
[03:46:51] <pavonia> No problem
[03:47:03] * orionshock shoots self in foot
[10:07:42] <robertparkerx> Can someone help me? I'm trying to get the amount to print -- https://jsfiddle.net/jo3sL8nf/
[10:11:26] <Cork> you don't have a file dwith the name amount
[10:11:38] <Cork> its "amount[Thu][ci2,16-0x1]"
[10:12:03] <robertparkerx> the $_POST value will select all I thought
[10:12:30] <Cork> what does $_POST have to do with css selectors?
[10:12:55] <robertparkerx> I just thought the same logic would apply sorry
[10:12:58] <robertparkerx> I'm learning too
[10:13:05] <Cork> no, not even close
[10:13:17] <Cork> the name has to be an exact match
[10:13:27] <Cork> if you can't i recommend giving the field a class
[10:27:22] <robertparkerx> yea that made it easier. I just thought I discovered a better way.
[10:27:25] <robertparkerx> Sorry
[10:27:38] <robertparkerx> It was in the source of a project I'm working on
[10:36:06] <robertparkerx> Thanks Cork
[10:36:11] <Cork> np
[10:55:09] <lxer> I inserted some divs using .append() , and when I click on these divs something should happen, but that isn't working because the eventhandler was declared on document.ready() . What would be needed to make that work after a insert() or append() ?
[10:59:37] <thykka> lxer, either attach the event handlers after you've inserted the elements, or use a delegate handler
[10:59:51] <thykka> latter is preferable, especially if you have more than one of those elements
[11:00:23] <thykka> $(document.body).on('click', '.yourElement', yourClickHandler)
[11:01:13] <lxer> I think I tried that ^ but doesn't work.
[11:01:28] <thykka> then there's something else messing things up
[11:02:32] <lxer> ok let me try again...
[11:09:37] <lxer> thykka: ok thanks, it is working.
[11:49:37] <z1haze> when using an arrow function for a submit handler, how can i access the form from the submit event?
[11:49:47] <z1haze> is that currentTarget?
[11:51:05] <z1haze> ...submit((e) => { const $form = $(e.currentTarget); } ?
[11:59:06] <z1haze> is it possible to get the form from a .submit event ?
[12:12:14] <relipse> https://hastebin.com/ocuretubel.xml <-- what is wrong with this, when ever I change the value it like gets a previous value and not all the numbers in the phone
[12:12:45] <robertmaxrees> mind making a fiddle?
[12:19:23] <relipse> ok here is what I have: https://jsfiddle.net/q18h4rgy/
[12:19:37] <relipse> does that seem good?
[12:19:38] <robertmaxrees> and how do i replicate your bug
[12:19:38] <robertmaxrees> ?
[12:19:48] <relipse> I fixed it now
[12:19:58] <relipse> thanks for telling me to create a fiddle
[12:20:52] <robertmaxrees> :)
[17:59:23] <kawhi> hello?
[18:00:14] <kawhi> whats the most popular graphql library on the server/client?
[22:03:28] <madprops> is doing https://paste.merkoba.com/1553824996-limivu-1 prone for problems with race conditions?
[22:03:36] <madprops> would the class be active in the next line?
[22:04:26] <robertmaxrees> no race condition
[22:04:31] <robertmaxrees> that's a synchronous operation
[22:04:53] <madprops> the thing is .placed_main has transition: top 500ms;
[22:05:02] <madprops> but the transition is not working in some cases
[22:05:03] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:05:24] <robertmaxrees> transitions are a funny thing.
[22:05:37] <robertmaxrees> depending on what all you're doing, the browser might render them as if the transition's already finished.
[22:08:43] <madprops> if i execute commands 1 by 1 with a small delay the transition effect works
[22:08:54] <madprops> so im thinking the only solution would be giving it some x delay
[22:08:57] <robertmaxrees> i'd need to see what all is happening
[22:09:26] <robertmaxrees> https://stackoverflow.com/a/19907889/923919
[22:09:30] <robertmaxrees> for some more info
[22:09:51] <madprops> hmmm
[22:10:13] <madprops> usually i don't like relying on hacks, for future proof issues, but im gonna try this
[22:10:24] <robertmaxrees> using setTimeout is a hack ;)
[22:13:22] <madprops> doesn't work, I tried various variations
[22:13:33] <robertmaxrees> have a fiddle?
[22:13:57] <madprops> lol no, i'd have to host the whole game
[22:14:03] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[22:14:07] <robertmaxrees> i mean an isolated test case.
[22:14:12] <robertmaxrees> not your entire frontend :)
[22:14:25] <madprops> would be too hard to port
[22:14:29] <robertmaxrees> hrm
[22:14:31] <robertmaxrees> strange
[22:14:32] <robertmaxrees> but ok
[22:18:50] <madprops> ok i think the hack you linked works, i was applying it on initial set, not on the change itself
[22:18:59] <robertmaxrees> lol
[22:19:00] <robertmaxrees> k
[23:14:24] <aiosud> What is the best way to return true of false to the function itself so i can do if (emailValidator())  code https://hastebin.com/ulivilinop.js
