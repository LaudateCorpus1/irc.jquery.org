[00:21:13] <krad> hi.  i have my scripts in documentA's <head>.  now with jquerymobile i'm going to page B.. why my scripts aren't defined in page B's inside <div data-role="page">?  i'm trying to access them from there.
[00:29:22] <krad> my question is wouldn't the scripts defined in index's <head> be available to other pages data roles in jquery mobile?
[00:30:33] <Thump> hi, how to pass php var $data to script? see my fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/Nr8aJ/
[00:36:37] <ravenzz> Thump you could either get those data with an ajax req, or hold it into an hidden input your markup as json encoded string
[00:36:49] <ktwo> Hi, i have an issue regarding jQuery.ajax() - Since the server which accepts the request sometimes takes more than the gateway-timeout, i need to ensure it is reconnected. any advice? is there something to avoid gateway timeout?
[00:37:36] <ravenzz> Thump eg <input type="hidden" id="init-data" value="{&quot;foo&quot;:&quot;bar&quot;}">
[00:39:25] <Thump> ravenzz: i have a vague idea in my head. is it possible to add a class to a field (<a class="hasError" />) and register a .click and call a function and somehow pass that $data in?
[00:40:07] <krad> geekz this channel is almost inactive
[00:40:21] <krad> 802 users sleeping?  can't be!
[00:40:34] <Thump> ravenzz: google search showed: onchange='my_function( <?php
[00:40:35] <Thump>     $mensagem_id = "3";
[00:40:35] <Thump>     echo $mensagem_id;
[00:40:35] <Thump>  ?>
[00:40:47] <Thump> not sure how to do it using jquery events
[00:40:49] <ravenzz> Thump that's horrible
[00:40:53] <ravenzz> you shouldn't do that
[00:40:55] <ravenzz> hold on
[00:40:57] <a930913> What's the lightest thing I can put between the brackets for this to work? $().data("foo","bar").data()
[00:43:42] <fabioportieri> a930913: make sense pls
[00:44:27] <_Thoams> Mornin'
[00:45:21] <_Thoams> Is there a way to get a draggable's containment rule to apply to the draggable's child elements?
[00:46:38] <a930913> fabioportieri: As in I could use $("<div>").data("foo","bar").data(), but that would use a div. Is there anything lighter than a div that I can use, seeing as this is only to generate an object to pass to a function that reads the .data().
[00:48:09] <fabioportieri> lighter than a div?
[00:48:26] <a930913> fabioportieri: As in the element is just a container.
[00:48:40] <a930913> But I don't need to use the container other than to contain.
[00:48:51] <a930913> So I want the lightest thing.
[00:50:28] <ktwo> so any idea for my "502 (Bad Gateway)" problem with jQuery.ajax? :| It even has keep-alive active but it doesnt seem to help
[00:52:09] <fabioportieri> a930913: are you aware dom elements doesn't have a "weight"?
[00:54:02] <a930913> fabioportieri: Are you aware that different elements have different functions and attributes?
[00:55:56] <fabioportieri> a930913: so what?
[00:56:41] <a930913> fabioportieri: Therefore, one with fewer attributes or functions is lighter than one with more.
[00:56:53] <ravenzz> Thump something like this http://jsfiddle.net/wGzqY/
[00:57:03] <fabioportieri> you're still no making sense to me
[00:57:20] <fabioportieri> first of all dom elements doesn't come with function afaik
[00:57:48] <fabioportieri> and even if they have different attributes doesn't mean an element is lighter than another
[00:58:17] <fabioportieri> in fact there is no such concept
[00:58:31] <fabioportieri> you can speed up your *selectors*
[00:58:59] <fabioportieri> but saying $("someElement") is faster/slower than $("anotherElement") is bullshit.
[00:59:45] <a930913> fabioportieri: Which is lighter, {foo:'bar'} or {foo:'bar',src:'baz.png'}?
[01:00:44] <krad> anyone with some jquery mobile experience?
[01:01:05] <Thump> ravenzz: thanks. i'll take a look. this is what i'm trying to do in a bit more detail http://jsfiddle.net/Nr8aJ/2/
[01:01:32] <fabioportieri> a930913: you really need to obsess about the performance whenever you add an attribute to an element? i don't think so
[01:03:18] <AdamPDotty> k2: I dont think that works with js, maybe set http-header but none i know
[01:03:59] <a930913> fabioportieri: I'm not using the element, so I'm asking for the lightest one. Is it such a hard question to answer?
[01:32:39] <Kingsy> can someone tell me how to improve this --> http://jsfiddle.net/fRQ8X/ <-- the idea is to cross fade two backgrounds, but have the animation stop and return to normal on hover out, even if the animation has not finished.
[01:32:52] <huglester> guys, is there a way to unbind ('click) event only on the parent, and not childs?
[01:33:40] <^^jfc^^> hello there, I've been working on an accordion style menu. It works properly, but I only got to close the tabs when clicking on a new one, instead of close if I click over an expanded tab. Any idea is welcome. Thanks in advance http://jsfiddle.net/UREff/
[01:35:40] <xec_> Kingsy: http://jsfiddle.net/fRQ8X/1/
[01:35:49] <xec_> ?stop @ Kingsy
[01:35:49] <bot-t> Kingsy, .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[01:36:21] <Kingsy> ahhhh ffs
[01:36:24] <Kingsy> xec_: thanks!
[01:36:58] <lejocelyn> do you know if .preventDefault() prevents a submit button to send its own name / value to the post data ?
[01:37:09] <xec_> huglester: you have click events on both the parent and children?
[01:37:26] <lejocelyn> or is it serialize() that doesn't get the submit button ?
[01:37:43] <xec_> huglester: or do you want a click to only trigger on some children of what you bound to?
[01:38:37] <xec_> ^^jfc^^: what is it you want it to do, exactly?
[01:39:26] <huglester> xec_: I have clickable obejcts inside.. but only want to unbind from #parend, while keepin input fields inside clickable
[01:40:14] <xec_> ?demo @ huglester

[01:42:13] <^^jfc^^> sorry for the lack of explanation xec_ I want it to expand and collapse the tabs on click, but at the moment, it I have an expanded tab , I'd like to collapse it when clicking on itself as well, as now, I can only close a tab, when clicking on a different one
[01:46:44] <lejocelyn> hum, found a hint to the solution http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4007942/jquery-serializearray-doesnt-include-the-submit-button-that-was-clicked
[01:48:05] <xec_> ^^jfc^^: http://jsfiddle.net/UREff/2/
[01:48:14] <lejocelyn> then I still don't get how to get the value of the submit button
[01:48:44] <lejocelyn> is it possible to get the name / value of a submit button when you serialize a form ?
[01:49:14] <lejocelyn> or should I just append it to the string generated by the .serialize() function ?
[01:52:13] <AdamPDotty> if the submit button has a name attribute it works like any other input
[01:52:27] <lejocelyn> AdamPDotty:  what ?
[01:52:35] <lejocelyn> no, it's not
[01:53:38] <lejocelyn> AdamPDotty: submit buttons aren't included into the serialized data
[01:53:43] <^^jfc^^> thanks you very much xec_
[01:54:07] <AdamPDotty> or I should read up on serialize
[01:54:22] <lejocelyn> :)
[01:54:46] <lejocelyn> http://api.jquery.com/serialize/
[01:57:33] <snorti> http://nopaste.info/456244e634.html any reasen why this would not work in IE but run fine in FF,Safari&chrome?
[01:57:38] <AdamPDotty> strange enough
[01:58:28] <lejocelyn> AdamPDotty:  var dataForm = $(form);
[01:58:29] <lejocelyn> 	  var postData = dataForm.serialize() + $('[type="submit"]').attr("name");
[01:58:45] <lejocelyn> a quick fix
[01:58:53] <AdamPDotty> yep, do it manually
[01:59:10] <AdamPDotty> you just need to know, which submit button was clicked
[01:59:36] <lejocelyn> they should have an option in the serialize.() to change this behaviour
[02:00:02] <lejocelyn> I understand it could be usefull not to get the submit button but it also can be
[02:00:44] <AdamPDotty> $('form input[type=submit]').serialize(); gives nothing
[02:00:56] <AdamPDotty> thats surprising behaviour
[02:01:00] <fabioportieri> in notepad++ how can i replace a word with a whitespace?
[02:01:24] <AdamPDotty> mark the word and hit space :-9
[02:01:25] <lejocelyn> fabioportieri: hum, not the proper place to ask this kind of question
[02:01:41] <fabioportieri> lejocelyn: right, but dunno where to ask, the official channel is kinda dead
[02:01:58] <lejocelyn> fabioportieri: on your linux distro channel
[02:02:18] <fabioportieri> i'm on win7
[02:03:15] <lejocelyn> else, probably a good regexp would do then I don't know if notepad++ has a replace function that can use regular expression
[02:03:21] <lejocelyn> try ctrl + r
[02:03:40] <AdamPDotty> the logic seems to be that even onsubmit works before the actual submit, and the submit button only gets included then
[02:04:23] <fabioportieri> yes but my regex doesn't work
[02:13:45] <lejocelyn> fabioportieri: doesn't work isn't a way to help
[02:13:50] <lejocelyn> fabioportieri: what's not working?
[02:13:59] <lejocelyn> what's your reg exp ?
[02:14:00] <fabioportieri> solved thanks aniway
[02:14:13] <lejocelyn> how did you solve this ?
[02:14:16] <fabioportieri> i just had to put absolutely nothing in the replace box
[02:14:27] <fabioportieri> (wanted to replace a word with whitespace)
[02:15:04] <lejocelyn>  ...
[02:15:24] <lejocelyn> don't ask to ask, just ask
[02:18:08] <fabioportieri> i said i solved already and explained how :|
[02:20:31] <fabioportieri> i never ask to ask unless i'm really ot

[06:50:21] <kzurawel> jolun: What collisions? I don't see you calculating any collisions...
[06:51:03] <jolun> well only 2 rectangles can collide with my orange cube. i dont know why the two others cant
[06:51:14] <c4ptnh00k> Morning
[06:51:27] <kzurawel> Hmm ok. You sent the wrong fiddle then
[06:51:34] <kzurawel> No orange cubes there.  :)
[06:54:45] <drakythe> You know, every time I think I'm getting a handle on jQuery I go and do something to prove myself wrong. For instance, I'm trying to make a simple calculator here, but something is clearly wrong, I just can't figure out what. http://jsfiddle.net/drakythe/mP84n/3/ the current desire is if you put in 100 in the Annual Gross revenue box, the '???' to the left of it will be replaced with '10' after pressing the calculate button.
[06:54:47] <jolun> http://jsfiddle.net/FeSb4/ this ne ?
[06:54:50] <jolun> one*
[06:55:43] <kzurawel> jolun: Right, it's a black circle with a smaller circle that follows the mouse. No cubes in sight.
[06:55:45] <drakythe> jolun: no orange cubes for me either
[06:56:15] <jolun> oops sorry. should work now
[06:56:15] <jolun> http://jsfiddle.net/FeSb4/1/
[06:57:06] <kzurawel> drakythe: having things like var emplOp = ; is breaking javascript
[06:57:20] <Saaether> drakythe http://jsfiddle.net/mP84n/4/
[06:57:21] <kzurawel> drakythe: set them to "false" or "null" (or comment them out) and it should work
[06:57:28] <Saaether> ya what kzurawel said heh
[06:57:35] <drakythe> kzurawel: oh good grief, thank you for helping the n00b
[06:57:37] <Saaether> cant have = ;
[06:58:22] <kzurawel> drakythe: Chrome Developer Tools / Firebug / [insert debugging tool here] are your friend. :)
[06:58:50] <drakythe> kzurawel: you know I should know that. I use firebug all the time for css, I always forget it can be used for js too
[07:01:00] <rob_23> can anybody tell me why im not able to get the else condition in the resp function http://jsfiddle.net/g2hrC/
[07:01:32] <kzurawel> rob_23: term = ' ' is assigning a space to term, not testing for equality
[07:02:44] <rob_23> kzurawel:  fixed that but now is not validating
[07:04:20] <kzurawel> rob_23: based on what I can see of your code, you probably want to do the validation outside of the ajax call - no reason to make the request and wait for response if you're just going to ignore it anyway

[07:07:53] <rob_23> kzurawel:  thanks
[07:17:46] <vota> Hello.. I am using blueimp jquery file upload, and the thumbnail fails to create for the larger images with 'internal server error'. there's nothing in the webserver log or in the php log... anyone know how i can troubleshoot this?
[07:20:36] <BillCriswell> vota: What happens if you try to access the URL of the form directly?
[07:23:53] <vota> Oh hell, the form is pointed to some demo thing and it is over quota. lol! large files still upload on my server though, how peculiar
[07:25:14] <vota> i'm not really sure where to point my form, guess I gotta read the docs more =) thanks
[07:25:56] <c4ptnh00k> Any Ideas of what to use for image upload that will give me a thumbnail preview?
[07:28:21] <BillCriswell> vota: Welcome.
[07:29:11] <str8uplinux> is this the proper way to append my msgID variable in my select val?   var postTournyID = $("select#postTourny_"+msgID+ "option:selected").val();
[07:30:33] <BillCriswell> str8uplinux: If it works it's correct. You don't need anything before the #, though.
[07:31:15] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: http://blueimp.github.io/jQuery-File-Upload/index.html this seems pretty swet. I haven't played with it, though.
[07:31:41] <ShrtSong> Hey, I'm running into a very strange occurrence with my $.ajax call. I have my $.ajax call, which fetches a computer name, then after testing that computer name against variables on page, there is another $.ajax call inside. The second $.ajax call fails UNLESS I put a distinct delay before it.
[07:32:29] <BillCriswell> ShrtSong: So you're doing $.ajax({success: function(){ $.ajax() }); ?
[07:33:06] <ShrtSong> Yes
[07:33:14] <ShrtSong> I've turned off async, and that just breaks everything.
[07:33:33] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: Thanks man. I had seen that one and was about to grab it. Just wanted to see if I was missing any cool options.
[07:33:59] <BillCriswell> ShrtSong: You don't have to turn off async to do the code I tried.
[07:34:10] <BillCriswell> Make sure it's true and try again.
[07:34:12] <ShrtSong> BillCriswell, I have tried a few variations tho. complete:, .done(), etc., still happens. The INTERESTING part is that the error message is something generated server-side, a java XML parsing error.
[07:34:15] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: I haven't had to do that too much.
[07:34:45] <ShrtSong> So maybe because the server can't handle simultaneous requests it's generating that error. Imma check. brb
[07:35:18] <BillCriswell> ShrtSong: It is waiting for the first one to finish if you're putting nother ajax call in the success callback.
[07:35:26] <c4ptnh00k> BillCriswell: Yeah I dont see alot of value in needing to preview images in such a fancy way for a business, but criteria is criteria lol
[07:35:40] <BillCriswell> c4ptnh00k: Agreed.
[07:36:10] <vota> BillCriswell: Just want to say thanks for quick response, it's because of that I will be allowed to continue using IRC from work ;-)
[07:36:26] <BillCriswell> Nice!
[07:36:33] <ShrtSong> Well, I did, and it's generating that error still. :\ But it doesn't if I put a delay like an alert or something.
[07:37:07] <BillCriswell> ShrtSong: I had a weird issue recently where I couldn't PUT then POST on a server. It wasn't fun.
[07:38:21] <ShrtSong> BillCriswell, yah, I'm going to try something different server-side that might work, though it's quite an extensive change. :/
[07:39:23] <BillCriswell> ShrtSong: Sure you're looking at the right error logs? I'm pretty notorious for that.
[07:41:23] <Nomikos> Using the jqueryui datepicker, is it possible to select a range within a single date picker month?
[07:41:24] <Bloomberg> morning guys!!
[07:41:40] <vota> hi Bloomberg
[07:41:45] <Bloomberg> someone could tell me what JQuery function works for find an element in a page?
[07:41:45] <Nomikos> and/or to show the range in the inline display?
[07:45:11] <ShrtSong> Boom! It's working now! :D
[07:46:37] <Saaether> `api find @ Bloomberg
[07:46:37] <b-ot> Bloomberg: .find(): Get the descendants of each element in the current set of matched elements, filtered by a selector, jQuery object, or element. http://api.jquery.com/find/
[07:47:16] <ShrtSong> So the solution is non-jquery-related, but I'll share it anyway. As I said, the error that was getting generated on the $.ajax call was from an actual page response, which was a java-related XML parsing error (it's a java http server). The problem was that the handler - once created - sticks around for a while, thus leaving any of it's properties available to be abused as it was. Tho now that I think of
[07:47:16] <ShrtSong>  it, I dunno why that would cause a problem. :\
[07:47:50] <ShrtSong> But anyway, I simply removed the properties and made them all private to the handler method, and the query now responds correctly. Hurrah! :D
[07:50:51] <Bloomberg> http://jsbin.com/enivek/1/edit
[07:51:09] <Bloomberg> How could I get the value of the before of the forms  radio inputs
[07:51:11] <Bloomberg> ?
[07:52:23] <jedimind> you dont
[07:52:27] <jedimind> thats why inputs have a value attribute
[07:52:40] <jedimind> <input type="radio" name="agree" value="yes">
[07:52:46] <jedimind> <input type="radio" name="agree" value="no">
[07:53:18] <jedimind> or, you can do proper lablel / input relationship
[07:53:19] <drakythe> hmm… new question. I'm trying to figure the best way to strip out any comma's from an input field and parse it into a float, but so far all my results end up NaN. http://jsfiddle.net/drakythe/mP84n/6/ any tips?
[07:53:52] <drakythe> (only the Annual Gross Revenue field has the new float/strip logic on it)
[07:53:56] <jedimind> <label for="param_agree_yes"><input type="radio" name="agree" id="param_agree_yes" value="1">
[07:54:25] <Saaether> drakythe val() not text()
[07:54:29] <Saaether> http://jsfiddle.net/mP84n/7/
[07:54:31] <jedimind> then do $('label[for=' + $('input').id() + ']').something
[07:54:34] <jedimind> @ Bloomberg
[07:55:03] <drakythe> Saaether: ah! thank you

[08:09:14] <shart> how do I simulate the user clicking a link (anchor tag) via jquery ?
[08:09:49] <sic_vita> simulate?
[08:09:58] <pachet> $('#mylink').trigger('click')
[08:10:04] <shart> that doesn't work
[08:10:10] <sic_vita> $('.link').click()
[08:10:13] <pachet> doesn't work is horribly inspecific
[08:10:26] <Brodingo> you cant simulate a native click
[08:10:33] <Brodingo> only trigger bound events
[08:10:34] <shart> I have a file download that the link points to
[08:10:58] <sic_vita> you want to force a file download with no user interaction?
[08:11:05] <jstroem> you can do something like: locatation.href = $(this).attr('href')
[08:11:27] <shart> jstroem: but then the IE7 information bar pops up
[08:11:37] <shart> I really want to work around the IE7 information bar.
[08:12:02] <pachet> Brodingo well, you can, but only in modern browsers
[08:12:08] <pachet> and it's not a #jq feature
[08:12:10] <pachet> but, http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-2-Events/events.html#Events-MouseEvent
[08:18:13] <manster> is there any reason why any attempts to set the display property of a div to "NONE" prior to page load doesnt work,  even though the line is stepped through during the page load?  (i've tried moving the code to document.ready() and window.onload with no luck )
[08:19:44] <thmsmlr> Manster: If you're trying to alter the DOM before page load, you need to make sure the script is below the element you're trying to alter

[08:21:40] <thmsmlr> http://jsfiddle.net/QVsWe/1/
[08:21:58] <manster> thmsmlr: oh wow. i was hoping it wouldnt be this sort of thing. my js code is added dynamically and aggregated ( using drupal ). :(
[08:22:29] <thmsmlr> Manster: I'm not 100% sure that's the issue, it was just the first thing that came to mind
[08:22:34] <JimmyAtCMU> thmsmlr: thanks!!!!!! it's fixed!!!!!!!
[08:22:38] <JimmyAtCMU> :D
[08:23:44] <manster> thmsmlr: yea, i'll look into different ways to alter the dom prior to page load, thanks
[08:30:32] <JimmyAtCMU> One more thing,
[08:30:34] <JimmyAtCMU> In the code segment, the enable/disable works, but when I tried the whole web page, it does not work again...
[08:30:46] <JimmyAtCMU> So generally where should I <source blah> </source> the code?

[08:49:08] <KanKouni> jquery lib == awesome
[08:49:42] <KanKouni> since i've read about the MVC its more fun to play around the jquery as a userside half engin
[08:52:07] <themojowill> is there any reason why .change() doesn't work when selecting the first item in a selectbox? Works if I select option 3 then option 1 but doesn't fire if I select option 1 first?
[08:53:27] <kzurawel> themojowill: is option 1 selected by default? If so, it's not really a "change"
[08:53:49] <themojowill> option isn't set as default
[08:54:16] <themojowill> it's empty on load

[09:22:49] <BillCriswell> rob_23: Check out the error console.
[09:23:08] <stephen_camilo> now how do I get the ratio of each image and resize it according its own ratio?
[09:23:10] <BillCriswell> rob_23: "This happens if you pass in a string as a data point"
[09:23:28] <BillCriswell> Anything coming from .val() is a string. You'll need to do +serv or parseInt(serv) or whatever.

[09:32:21] <lord4163> Hello
[09:32:24] <c4ptnh00k> qwerty
[09:32:30] <c4ptnh00k> Hello
[09:35:06] <lord4163> Does anyone know how I can switch from page without running the javascript? $.mobile.changePage('#home');
[09:37:17] <amcsi_work> does anyone know a fix for the issue that sometimes selecting an element in the element panel in Google Chrome is slow?
[09:37:50] <c4ptnh00k> according to google analytics $.answer = 42
[09:38:21] <c4ptnh00k> lord4163: you mean redirect?
[09:39:49] <lord4163> c4ptnh00k: Yes, I want to go back to my index.html or #home but without loading all the functions in the js file
[09:41:16] <c4ptnh00k> um so you want to dynamically load js files as they are needed and not at pageload
[09:44:16] <c4ptnh00k> lord4163: I guess I dont understand what you are trying to accomplish
[09:44:25] <lord4163> c4ptnh00k: Let me explain, when index.html got loaded it, grabs all info from my websql database and displays it in a list view. When I create a new user it may not load that function, because it will load the old info
[09:44:59] <c4ptnh00k> lord4163: Ah ok.
[09:45:57] <c4ptnh00k> lord4163: why not just populate the list given an event handler
[09:46:48] <lord4163> c4ptnh00k: How do you mean?
[09:47:43] <c4ptnh00k> lord4163: You can pupulate the list with an ajax call and when you add a new item just call the ajax call again
[09:47:49] <c4ptnh00k> populate*
[09:48:04] <c4ptnh00k> that way you are not having to reload anything
[09:48:27] <c4ptnh00k> or refresh i should say
[09:48:58] <lord4163> c4ptnh00k: But iit's all local?
[09:50:09] <c4ptnh00k> sorry i see websql now. missread mysql
[09:50:30] <c4ptnh00k> hrmmm
[09:50:32] <lord4163> c4ptnh00k: Is there a function to check if the previous page was index.html?
[09:50:42] <tripflex> so i'm working on a site i've created for people to use to get a website's ip address
[09:50:42] <imsky> check the referrer
[09:50:56] <tripflex> but i need to sanitize the input and im using jquery and ajax
[09:51:13] <tripflex> does anybody know of any opensource projects or anything else that is popular for jquery or javascript sanitizing?
[09:52:13] <imsky> sanitizing?
[09:52:28] <tripflex> yeah so like
[09:52:32] <tripflex> www.getwebsiteip.com
[09:52:36] <lord4163> tripflex: echo $SERVER['remote_addr']; in PHP :P
[09:52:38] <c4ptnh00k> lord4163: sorry I just don't know that one
[09:52:43] <tripflex> i don't want someone to be able to inject code through the input
[09:52:57] <imsky> so strip tags
[09:53:17] <tripflex> yeah but was hoping there was already some type of a project out there that was just a jquery file i could include
[09:53:19] <tripflex> that would sanitize for me
[09:53:23] <tripflex> strip tags, etc
[09:53:37] <tripflex> found a few on github but they are all random
[09:53:38] <snover> document.createTextNode
[09:53:39] <b-ot> snover: You have 1 new message (and 1 unread), use `read when you wish to read it.
[09:53:48] <imsky> you think javascript would help you sanitize code before submitting it to the server?
[09:54:25] <tripflex> i know it's client side but i'm using ajax like
[09:54:39] <tripflex> index.php?url=".url
[09:54:53] <tripflex> so i guess technically i could use php
[09:55:09] <tripflex> just trying to make sure i protect the site as much as possible from stupid people messing with it
[09:55:28] <Nomikos> if it's at all important, you should sanitize server-side [too]
[09:56:12] <tripflex> yeah i'm working on that :P
[09:56:43] <Nomikos> okie, cool
[09:56:51] <Saaether> tripflex http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_escape.asp
[09:58:06] <tripflex> ok so does that strip tags?
[09:59:39] <Nomikos> uhm, no that appears to urlencode input
[10:00:34] <Saaether> that escapes strings so they cant inject code with it
[10:00:47] <Saaether> if you want to remove tags that would need to be added as well
[10:01:07] <Nomikos> it encodes strings, not the same as escaping
[10:01:15] <Nomikos> I'd just use serverside strip_tags()
[10:01:28] <Nomikos> (php)
[10:01:52] <dannydagger> hey guys.. what is this thing with the moving background? html5 video? http://www.saganowski.com/ or do they use some jquery technique?
[10:02:02] <Nomikos> or, you could choose to echo any input with htmlentities()
[10:02:04] <BillCriswell> tripflex: Sanitizing with JS is just an extra step.
[10:02:15] <tripflex> yeah i'm just trying to cover all bases
[10:02:30] <tripflex> i own a hosting company so unfortuantely im way too familliar with how often people try to exploit sites
[10:02:36] <Nomikos> dannydagger: http://www.saganowski.com/img/hi/video.ogv
[10:02:43] <tripflex> and being as though all the code is custom i know i'm going to have issues
[10:02:48] <tripflex> trying to be proactive about it lol
[10:02:58] <dannydagger> Nomikos: thx m8
[10:03:27] <BillCriswell> tripflex: It's very easy for a user to disable JS.
[10:03:47] <BillCriswell> Especially someone who would be up to no good lol
[10:04:05] <tripflex> yeah i know, just wasn't sure what was possible because right now
[10:04:08] <tripflex> if you check out the site
[10:04:12] <tripflex> http://www.getwebsiteip.com
[10:04:27] <tripflex> i'm using ajax to load the page again inserting the inptu from user
[10:04:33] <tripflex> passing it to php file as a GET variable
[10:04:55] <tripflex> but i guess validating with php would be the move
[10:06:36] <banister`shop> what's the diff b/w console.log and console.info ?
[10:07:36] <BillCriswell> banister`shop: I'm not sure there's any. I know console.error() puts a red x dealie.
[10:07:48] <banister`shop> thx
[10:08:11] <Saaether> info adds the "i" icon
[10:08:33] <BillCriswell> Saaether: Ah, I was looking in Chrome.
[10:08:55] <BillCriswell> console.log() and console.info() appear identical in Chrome.
[10:10:36] <BillCriswell> console.table([[1,2,3,4],[2,3,4,5]]) sweeeeet
[10:10:54] <Nomikos> tripflex: I guess if passing it as GET parameter, you could url encode the input afterall
[10:11:28] <tripflex> that's what im thinking and then using php to validate
[10:11:49] <tripflex> that would at least help in the process :)
[10:12:06] <lord4163> c4ptnh00k: You don't know how to fully reload the page. I'm getting insane.
[10:12:10] <Nomikos> tripflex: personally I'd just use $.get() or $.post() and let those worry about the details
[10:12:17] <Saaether> ya the blue i icon only shows up in firefox, wonder by chrome didnt add that
[10:12:39] <Saaether> wonder why*
[10:13:43] <BillCriswell> How am I just learning about console.table
[10:13:50] <BillCriswell> this is so damn useful

[12:25:35] <shoky> BillCriswell: just learned about it a few days ago.. haven't used it yet ;p
[12:26:33] <binaryfus10nz> anyone prefer media queries over JS helpers? I almost feel like you dont ever need MQ
[12:27:02] <BillCriswell> shoky: I think it's the bee's knees.
[12:35:44] <frdmn> hey
[12:36:45] <frdmn> i noticed that my website has a strange "blackscreen flickering" since some days/weeks... i was always using chrome and i never had issues like that... also no errors or anything. you can try out for yourself: http://frd.mn
[12:36:50] <frdmn> can some help me out here?
[12:36:57] <frdmn> (chrome 28.0.1500.37)
[12:42:24] <Bloomberg> Hi guys!!
[12:43:01] <Bloomberg> Someone know how is possible get down the podition of a page dynamically?
[12:43:13] <Bloomberg> position*
[12:43:21] <Pavlov> to scroll?
[12:43:33] <Bloomberg> so so
[12:45:03] <Bloomberg> For example if I click some element automatically go down specific poisitonin the page
[12:45:05] <Bloomberg> position*
[12:45:19] <visua> anchor
[12:45:20] <visua> tags
[12:59:21] <Nickel_> How would I add a body element to the document using jQuery?
[13:00:38] <BillCriswell> Nickel_: $('html').append('body') I guess? haha
[13:00:43] <BillCriswell> Never tried it.
[13:01:19] <shoky> doubts. and it's be .append('<body>') :P
[13:01:21] <shoky> it'd
[13:01:23] <Nickel_> That just adds 'body', I've tried $('html').append('<body></body>')
[13:01:26] <Nickel_> But it doesn't seem to work.
[13:01:44] <BillCriswell> Yeah, what shoky said.
[13:01:51] <BillCriswell> I brain farted.
[13:02:24] <Nickel_> shoky: Doesn't seem to work either :(
[13:02:53] <ckknight> Nickel_: internally you should already have a body element, even if it isn't explicitly defined
[13:03:03] <ckknight> see what $('body') returns before you try to add it
[13:03:09] <nerk> say I have <a class="btn no-load" ..>  how can I select .btn that don't also have .no-load with not()?
[13:03:26] <BillCriswell> nerk: Yes.
[13:03:41] <BillCriswell> $('.btn(:not(.no-load))')
[13:03:49] <nerk> eg. $('.btn').not('.no-load'); or $('.btn:not(.no-load)); do not work
[13:03:53] <shoky> Nickel_: i don't think multiple body elements are valid in html
[13:03:54] <BillCriswell> Yeah that.
[13:03:59] <nerk> yah, those
[13:04:01] <BillCriswell> I need another beer.
[13:04:01] <nerk> do not work
[13:04:07] <nerk> :(
[13:04:43] <nerk> I've never have had much success with not() or :not() actually.
[13:04:52] <Nickel_> shoky: I'm not trying to create multiple body elements. I'm trying to inject HTML into pages, but I've noticed that some websites don't have a body. Instead they use frames.
[13:04:59] <Nickel_> Only frames.
[13:05:06] <BillCriswell> nerk: http://jsbin.com/udofus/1/edit it works.
[13:05:15] <sacho> Nickel_, yes, and?
[13:05:23] <sacho> which of the frames do you want to inject html in?
[13:05:36] <shoky> Nickel_:  a frame has a body already if a page is loaded there
[13:05:41] <Nickel_> sacho: I don't want to inject frames, I just want to inject a div
[13:05:49] <nerk> hrrm
[13:05:50] <sacho> Nickel_, in which frame?
[13:05:55] <BillCriswell> nerk: http://jsbin.com/udofus/2/edit both work actually.
[13:05:58] <Nickel_> None, just globally
[13:05:59] <nerk> my template must not be refreshing
[13:06:04] <sacho> Nickel_, that's not possible
[13:06:09] <nerk> meh.
[13:06:17] <frdmn> noone an idea?
[13:06:18] <Nickel_> Can I just inject a frame then?
[13:06:30] <sacho> sure.
[13:07:04] <Nickel_> I'm trying to display a toolbar sort of thing at the top. How would I go about injecting the frame and will it still be compatible with websites that use <body> tags without frames>?
[13:08:04] <sacho> Adding a frame is like any other element. You might need to fiddle with the layout to get your toolbar in the right place. No, it won't be compatible with regular pages
[13:08:56] <Nickel_> sacho: Okay, thanks I'll try to see what I can do.
[13:09:52] <nerk> even worse, I didn't have the no-load class on the elements I was testing
[13:09:52] <nerk> heh
[13:09:54] <nerk> I need sleep
[13:10:36] <BillCriswell> nerk: Hahaha
[13:10:43] <BillCriswell> Been there man
[13:14:18] <Forbidd3n> Anyone that might know why this menu would shift on load?
[13:14:20] <ratchetass> hello how can I make an autoscroll function for this one
[13:14:21] <ratchetass> http://jsfiddle.net/STQnH/3/
[13:14:49] <ratchetass> this works on jsfiddle the autoscroll thing but in the live site its not
[13:14:51] <Forbidd3n> http://www.studiobecker.com
[13:15:45] <Forbidd3n> I believe it is js taking long to load, just not sure which one
[13:15:59] <Forbidd3n> Anyway to test/see in Firebug which items are taking long to load?
[13:17:08] <ratchetass> I think the problem lies with the chatcontent being refreshed every 2 secs
[13:17:16] <ratchetass> that's why it always refreshes to bottom
[13:17:44] <amph1bius> how do you make a bottom nav that animates upwards and not downwards so the browser doesn't have to scroll
[13:18:01] <sandropadin> @Forbidd3n I think the menu might be shifting because the font hasn't loaded
[13:19:03] <Forbidd3n> sandropadin: anyway to preload the font like you do images?
[13:19:27] <christo_m> hello, I'd like to do something on the click of a <td> but not if its a link inside a td, then i'd like to just perform what the link does
[13:19:38] <christo_m> is it possible to ignore a tags or something inside of a click handler bound to a td?
[13:21:54] <sandropadin> @Forbidd3n Unfortunately, I'm not sure. Alternatively, you might be able to set a timeout and fade the menu on after a split second to give the font enough time to load, but that's a bit of a hack.
[13:25:59] <thmsmlr> @Forbidd3n you could try loading the font into an element offscreen
[13:26:13] <thmsmlr> that should force the browser to load the font,
[13:26:15] <thmsmlr> something like
[13:26:47] <thmsmlr> .preload { position:absolute; top : −10000px; left: −10000px }
[13:27:01] <jedimind> wait what
[13:27:10] <jedimind> why would you have to preload a font
[13:27:43] <thmsmlr> I believe the browser loads fonts lazily
[13:27:52] <jedimind> nope
[13:28:00] <jedimind> if you include them with font-face
[13:28:05] <jedimind> @font-face
[13:28:22] <jedimind> also loading that element off screen will leave that area blank until its loaded which doesnt solve the problem at all ?
[13:30:13] <thmsmlr> Hmm, I feel like we're talking about different things, maybe I misunderstood the problem
[13:32:38] <sandropadin> This effect is named FOUT - flash of unstyled text. http://www.paulirish.com/2009/fighting-the-font-face-fout/
[13:33:27] <jedimind> yeah
[13:33:46] <nerk> i hate that shit
[13:33:49] <nerk> just google font it
[13:33:51] <nerk> and call it a day
[13:35:18] <cam> I am trying to do $( $(this).parent() ).remove(".class") but it isn't removing any elements, is my syntax wrong?
[13:35:54] <relipse> is it possible to have a <button> link?
[13:36:29] <shoky> cam: that would remove the parent if its class is "class"
[13:36:51] <shoky> cam: you probably want $(this).parent().find('.class').remove()
[13:37:17] <sic_vita> Just attackclone the grit repo pushmerge, then rubygem the lymphnode js shawarma module
[13:38:05] <shoky> relipse:  <a><button/></a> ?
[13:38:19] <relipse> is that valid?
[13:38:35] <shoky> donno but it just worked for me on chrome :S
[14:00:19] <shankstaBytes> quick question hot shot how can i drop all decimal places but the first without rounding you have ten minutes
[14:00:36] <NoiseEee> oh amazing, a challenge from shankstaBytes
[14:01:30] <shankstaBytes> not every day you get a challenge with this much glory
[14:02:33] <kzurawel> shankstaBytes: is the input always a float?
[14:03:09] <shankstaBytes> kzurawel: yes
[14:04:20] <kzurawel> shankstaBytes: Ugly, but works. var temp = input.toString().split('.'); var numString = temp[0] + '.' + temp[1][0]; return parseFloat(numString);
[14:06:23] <shankstaBytes> kzurawel: amazing hot shot you just save the lives of a 10 cats
[14:06:40] <kzurawel> yay cats
[14:06:51] <shankstaBytes> :D
[14:07:53] <shoky> lol
[14:12:00] <codepython7771> before redirecting to a page, i want to check whether the server/webpage is up. Can I do this using JS?
[14:18:10] <gadmeer> hiho
[14:18:18] <gadmeer> somone there from the jquery ui team?
[14:19:09] <gadmeer> ok, anyway i hope someone reads this
[14:19:23] <gadmeer> and i am to lazy to add it to some support formular / tracking....
[14:19:57] <gadmeer> jquery ui slider, content div has a fixed width of 2400px , if u add white-space: nowrap; insted of the px it will fit any content size
[14:19:59] <gadmeer> happy coding ;)
[14:20:35] <Zzaichik> thanks for sharing
[14:21:16] <jedimind> what
[14:37:15] <frdmn> i noticed that my website has a strange "blackscreen flickering" since some days/weeks... i was always using chrome and i never had issues like that... also no errors or anything. you can try out for yourself: http://frd.mn
[14:38:16] <dannydagger> does anyone know how i can center the video to all resolutions? so it can auto-adapt and fill out the whole screen? http://colorworld.se/avion/index.html
[14:38:42] <dannydagger> it is not my video, I'm gonna use another video later but I just wanna learn how to do it
[14:39:23] <Emn1ty|work> anyone know of other good slider api's that have this effect - http://www.jcoverflip.com/demo
[14:47:07] <thang> Emn1ty|work: you're looking for a carousel
[14:47:43] <Emn1ty|work> thang, one that allows that particular effect but I think I can modify bxslider to do it with some .animate() calls, I think
[14:47:58] <Emn1ty|work> http://bxslider.com/examples/carousel-demystified#example4 plus jquery animation for the size change
[14:50:16] <thang> yeah its definitely doable, its probably going to be a pain though
[14:57:16] <funhouse> Using the spinner widget with jquery ui, seems that the change event is not working, want to sanitize values after using types something in
[15:00:42] <quuxman> This handler isn't called on form elements created after this is called, right?  $('form[data-foo]').on('submit', ...)
[15:00:58] <quuxman> like it would be for $(...).on('click', ...)
[15:03:32] <Emn1ty|work> thang, maybe
[15:04:54] <Emn1ty|work> any help would be appreciated
[15:04:59] <Emn1ty|work> to speed along this process
[15:07:24] <quuxman> looks like the submit event doesn't bother with live behavior
[15:07:40] <quuxman> is there another reasonable way to accomplish this?
[15:09:52] <Emn1ty|work> ugh... I need a slider that does that that works... the one I linked doesn't work >:(
[15:14:35] <paulvd> is there a responsive js like screen specific js?
[15:14:51] <Krambiorix> how can i find the number of elements with class "selectmsg" that is checked?
[15:18:02] <Emn1ty|work> I can't believe there's no sliders that support a winwheel/ < [ small BIG small ] > type setup...
[15:18:09] <Emn1ty|work> pinwheel*
[15:20:57] <relipse> Is there a jquery alternative to this drop down menu? http://oi43.tinypic.com/nbde6b.jpg
[15:43:18] <craysiii> When i try to load a moustache template file into a script tag it doesn't get added when the page is rendered.. can anyone help me?
[15:45:11] <craysiii> http://pastebin.com/XMGg2WZc
[15:49:28] <Emn1ty|work> hate to keep asking, but nobody has any alternatives for a slider with a large center slide, and the ones to the right and left being smaller and shrinking to the background as they move from slide to slide?
[15:51:15] <not_mike> like an accordion?
[15:51:28] <Emn1ty|work> No
[15:51:39] <Emn1ty|work> . small BIG small .
[15:52:10] <craysiii> can someone help me out loading a moustache template into a script tag :/
[15:52:28] <Emn1ty|work> not_mike, http://www.jcoverflip.com/demo like that but this one has jquery UI integrated (and badly so).
[15:52:44] <Emn1ty|work> I was going to use bxslider, but I can't figure out how to tell what slide is centered.
[15:52:57] <not_mike> oh like a carousal
[15:53:02] <Emn1ty|work> yeah
[15:53:07] <not_mike> carousel*
[15:53:12] <not_mike> shit man idk
[15:53:16] <Emn1ty|work> but looking up the term carousel doesn't give me anything but standard sliders...
[15:54:04] <Emn1ty|work> I've seen it used a lot, yet when I ask nobody has anything to say... four channels and silence :(
[15:54:44] <Emn1ty|work> I can't believe that this is the only slider like this on the internet...
[15:55:36] <craysiii> thats how i feel.
[15:56:00] * Emn1ty|work rips hair out
[16:00:13] <Emn1ty|work> guess I'll just have to figure this stuff out myself...
[16:00:30] * craysiii feels your pain
[16:01:06] <Emn1ty|work> good luck, craysiii. I've been waiting for a couple hours for an answer from four channels
[16:01:51] <codacoder> guys.. is "#$x" a legal selector? (And therefore a legal element id)
[16:02:41] <JoshMcCullough> hey everyone
[16:02:59] <Emn1ty|work> hey
[16:03:18] <codacoder> anyone?
[16:08:46] <Emn1ty|work> anyone interested in helping me with something?
[16:09:07] <Emn1ty|work> I'm trying to detect which slide on this - http://jsfiddle.net/GAnhB/ is currently the center one.
[16:10:35] <jeebster> hi. I'm trying to call click() on an element on page load and nothing happens. If I pass the same command again in the console, the desired activity occurs. how can I fix this to properly trigger the click event on document ready?
[16:11:05] <Emn1ty|work> you are trying to have a click event happen when the dom is ready?
[16:11:15] <Emn1ty|work> or are you clicking to make the click even happen?
[16:11:39] <blindMoe> jeebster: is that element being created via javascript?
[16:12:02] <jeebster> blindMoe: no
[16:12:20] <jeebster> it's an html input
[16:12:21] <jeebster> on the page
[16:12:25] <blindMoe> are you calling the click event inside of $(document).ready( function() { ... } );  ?
[16:13:28] <jeebster> blindMoe: yes. the element is actually an anchor with behavior like a button. could that be why? I'm still calling click on the anchor
[16:13:48] <blindMoe> seems like it should still trigger
[16:14:06] <blindMoe> can you stick it on jsfiddle.net ?
[16:14:08] <jeebster> hmm yeah that shouldn't be the case
[16:16:12] <codacoder> jeebster: I'm confused - is it an input or an anchor
[16:16:20] <jeebster> codacoder: anchor
[16:16:32] <jeebster> well it seems to work fine on jsfiddle, must be something in this codebase I'm mucking about with
[16:22:14] <jeebster> ah got it, had to run after window was fully loaded
[16:23:28] <Emn1ty|work> I think at this rate I'm gonna have to build my own slider... ugh
[16:25:27] <shoelessone> Does anybody here know if there is a way to time the length of a tap on mobile with jQuery + (whatever)?
[16:25:51] <shoelessone> i.e. I want the output to be the time in miliseconds that a finger was on a particular <div> for instance
[16:25:59] <blindMoe> Emn1ty|work: why do you have to build your own? What functionality are you looking for?
[16:26:38] <blindMoe> shoelessone: there must be touchdown / touchup events right?  Are you using jquery mobile or jquery touch ?
[16:26:48] <Emn1ty|work> Basically, I want it to have all the slides visible horizontally, but the focused slide appears full size while the other appear smaller, blindMoe.
[16:26:56] <shoelessone> blindMoe: well, neither at the moment. I don't really need anything in the framework other then this functionality
[16:27:12] <blindMoe> shoelessone: look at the touch lib.. it is pretty small
[16:27:14] <Emn1ty|work> But the only thing I can find is: http://www.jcoverflip.com/demo but it requires jquery UI, and i'd rather not deal with that weird slide bar.
[16:27:49] <Emn1ty|work> and I cannot for the life of me find another slider that demonstrates that effect for sliding from one element to the next.
[16:27:56] <shoelessone> thanks blindMoe
[16:28:05] <blindMoe> np
[16:28:42] <blindMoe> Emn1ty|work: interesting.. I normally end up writing my own sliders when I need something out of the box like that
[16:28:45] <shoelessone> blindMoe: wait, are you sure it's called touchlib?
[16:28:56] <blindMoe> I bet you could use the cycle2 plugin and perform some small modifications
[16:30:09] <Emn1ty|work> blindMoe, you are a lifesaver
[16:30:09] <blindMoe> shoelessone: this may help: https://gist.github.com/CaptainN/2243148
[16:30:20] <blindMoe> lifesavers are delicious
[16:31:45] <Emn1ty|work> blindMoe, at least this slider shows me the active slider, which means via CSS/JS I can just transition when the class is lost.
[16:31:59] <blindMoe> yeah exactly
[16:32:17] <blindMoe> and you could adjust the closes sibling on either side if you want them in between the large and small sizes
[16:32:45] <Emn1ty|work> yeah
[16:33:10] <Emn1ty|work> now the question is can it handle not being continuous scroll...
[16:33:13] <JoshMcCullough> got a question, hope someone can point me in the right direction... trying to implement _getCreateOptions for ALL jQuery widgets, currently it's not being executed. any tips? Here's what i've got: http://jsfiddle.net/tGm5J/1/
[16:33:23] <blindMoe> Emn1ty|work: yeah I blieve that is just a setting
[16:33:51] <Emn1ty|work> blindMoe, actually it looks to not be quite what I want for that
[16:33:57] <Emn1ty|work> since the images still repeat
[16:34:09] <blindMoe> you may be able to just shut that off
[16:34:12] <Emn1ty|work> yeah
[16:34:20] <Emn1ty|work> I'll see what I can do, this is more than I had
[16:34:32] <blindMoe> I think it only repeats the images when in carousel mode
[16:38:16] <shoelessone> blindMoe: ha, turns out I didn't need to do anything: http://jsfiddle.net/j9LeV/2/
[16:38:50] <blindMoe> shoelessone: nice!
[16:38:54] <blindMoe> Emn1ty|work: allow-wrap: false;
[16:39:55] <blindMoe> didn't know touchstart and touchend are built in to jquery now
[16:40:43] <Emn1ty|work> oddly, this carousel doesn't perform quite like I expect it to
[16:41:03] <blindMoe> in what way?
[16:41:23] <Emn1ty|work> I copy and paste the code for the non-continous scroll slider and it doesn't look the same :\
[16:41:28] <Emn1ty|work> but I may just be doing something wrong
[16:41:55] <blindMoe> did you incorporate the css?
[16:42:03] <Emn1ty|work> hm... that might be it
[16:43:05] <Emn1ty|work> actually... there is no css?
[16:43:12] <blindMoe> css es muy importante with the sliders
[16:43:14] <blindMoe> there has to be some
[16:43:37] <Emn1ty|work> download = just js file
[16:43:57] <blindMoe> crazy .. maybe they got rid of the need and just hard coded it all in
[16:44:11] <blindMoe> well either way I would inspect their example and see what is being set
[16:49:01] <jeebster> is it possible to populate an input field of type email with text? I' using text() however the changes aren't persisting
[16:49:22] <blindMoe> what about .val()  ?
[16:50:22] <jeebster> blindMoe: brilliant. thanks
[16:51:10] <blindMoe> np
[16:53:05] <jeebster> one more q: I've got a modal pop-up after a click event, how can I listen for when that modal has finished loading?
[16:53:49] <VectorX> hi, can some1 tell me if there is a native way or a plugin to do the effect that happens to the quick link screens when you resize a google chrome window ?
[16:54:08] <VectorX> ie the little windows repositioning
[17:14:17] <JoshMcCullough> can anyone help me solve this fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/tGm5J/1/
[17:18:58] <jeebster> are there any known snags with listening for click events inside a function that is listening for click events?
[17:19:14] <tw2113> both could fire at once?
[17:20:00] <blindMoe> jeebster: why are you doing that?
[17:20:07] <blindMoe> just curious what the use case is for something like that
[17:20:21] <tw2113> spinning the top, man
[17:20:48] <blindMoe> a click within a click within a click withing a ...
[17:21:08] <jeebster> blindMoe: i've got a modal firing and within that modal I need to populate some form data when a user clicks a busson
[17:21:18] <VectorX> sorry i mean the effect of the thumbnails in the google crhome browser when you are on the "most visited" page and resize the window
[17:21:20] <jeebster> blindMoe: haha yeah, it's only two levels deep though
[17:21:46] <JoshMcCullough> anybody know about $.widget._getCreateOptions ?
[17:22:01] <tw2113> jeebster, so you're binding the listeners to different elements
[17:22:36] <jeebster> tw2113: yes
[17:22:40] <blindMoe> yeah what you described is different than a click within a click  :)
[17:22:43] <tw2113> i see nothing wrong then
[17:22:53] <blindMoe> you are just binding twice.. I don't see anything wrong with that
[17:23:06] <jeebster> tw2113: on one click, I pass an anonymous function in which I bind the click event of another element
[17:24:38] <banister_> yo, say i have an element that has a CSS class, and this CSS class just sets the background color to red ...is there a way to remove this class from the element such that the red appears to fade out
[17:24:46] <banister_> basically i want to animate a removeClass
[17:25:18] <tw2113> wouldn't opening a lightbox and then populating a form take 2 clicks jeebster ?
[17:25:34] <hugo_moss> use css animation in that class banister
[17:25:36] <JoshMcCullough> you can use CSS
[17:25:37] <JoshMcCullough> see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7302824/animating-addclass-removeclass-with-jquery
[17:26:33] <banister_> ah there is this: http://api.jqueryui.com/switchClass/
[17:26:35] <banister_> BUT
[17:26:45] <jeebster> tw2113: yes, I'm binding something to happen on the second click though, not actually performing the click
[17:26:51] <banister_> i dont want to switch the class, which the jquery-UI appears to want me to do, i just want to remove it
[17:27:01] <tw2113> so it's all happening with 1?
[17:27:21] <tw2113> my mind is mush
[17:29:22] <tw2113> i still think it's fine
[17:29:48] <tw2113> at one layer, the only thing the click does is invoke something else that actually does something
[17:30:01] <tw2113> however if the world blows up, i'm blaming you jeebster
[17:30:32] <jeebster> lol tw2113
[17:30:54] <jeebster> I see my issue, the element I'm targeting isn't yet defined. I somehow must poll for when my modal finishes loading
[17:30:59] <tw2113> crawl around the ground going "if only i knew this would happen, i could have warned jeebster"
[17:32:20] <JoshMcCullough> classic jeebster!
[17:32:34] <blindMoe> hehe
[17:32:45] <blindMoe> jeebster: use the callback for the modal
[17:34:15] <JoshMcCullough> seriously one of you peoples gotta help me with $.widget._getCreateOptions
[17:35:13] <jeebster> I would but unfortunately this isn't a jquery modal :\
[17:35:14] <tw2113> no idea what that is
[17:35:38] <JoshMcCullough> trying to specify defaults to take place when ANY widget is created
[17:35:48] <JoshMcCullough> that function is supposed to off this functionality
[17:35:53] <JoshMcCullough> i just have to implement it
[17:36:06] <JoshMcCullough> which i did, but apparently not correctly
[17:36:41] <tw2113> $.widget._getCreateOptions = function() { //define stuff here };   ?
[17:36:51] <JoshMcCullough> yep!
[17:36:54] <tw2113> just a stab in the dark
[17:37:02] <JoshMcCullough> this is what i tried
[17:37:06] <JoshMcCullough> in this fiddle... http://jsfiddle.net/tGm5J/1/
[17:37:14] <tw2113> is it supposed to be a function or an object?
[17:37:38] <JoshMcCullough> function
[17:37:42] <JoshMcCullough> for us to implement
[17:37:51] <JoshMcCullough> and then do w/e we want to the new widget
[17:37:58] <JoshMcCullough> e.g. set default options
[17:38:13] <JoshMcCullough> the documentation is very light though on this functionality
[17:38:29] <tw2113> dunno, haven't done anything with jQuery UI before
[17:38:31] <tw2113> but i tried
[17:39:12] <JoshMcCullough> thanks :)

[18:21:14] <RobW> I have a parent div that holds child div's... they are a SET width, so that they show 3 columns and X rows
[18:21:30] <RobW> In each row, I need to set all 3 divs the same height (whichever is taller, apply to all)
[18:21:49] <RobW> Then, I need to take the height of each row and get a SUM
[18:21:54] <RobW> can someone help with that?
[18:31:41] <motaka2> I dont know why the function at line 37 doesnt work on this script unless I copy the body of function formGetData() in it and replace $form with $(this) in it. http://pastebin.com/j8ZgfTzj
[18:32:36] <motaka2> can anyone see my messages?
[18:34:06] <RobW> don't pass $(this) directly, assign then pass
[18:34:32] <RobW> or you may be out of namespace
[18:35:16] <motaka2> I dont know why the function at line 37 doesnt work on this script unless I copy the body of function formGetData() in it and replace $form with $(this) in it. http://pastebin.com/j8ZgfTzj
[18:35:31] <RobW> motaka2 i just told you
[18:36:03] <RobW> don't pass $(this) directly, assign it to a var, then pass that var
[18:36:30] <RobW> var myvar = $(this); formDataGet(myvar);
[18:36:37] <RobW> actually
[18:36:42] <RobW> your formDataGet function is wrong
[18:37:06] <motaka2> RobW: thanks for the tip, but may you tell me why it doesnt work that way ?
[18:37:20] <RobW> hold on i'm testing to make sure
[18:38:00] <RobW> ignore last comment
[18:38:07] <RobW> but try to assign $(this) first, then pass that var
[18:38:08] <RobW> brb
[18:40:26] <Pavlov> are there any good cdn's for jquery mobile 1.3.1?
[18:40:27] <motaka2> RobW still the same
[18:40:33] <Pavlov> that support ssl
[18:40:41] <Pavlov> at the same domain?
[18:42:15] <VectorX> anyone know the effect for the thumbnails in the google chorme browser when you are on the "most visited" page and resize the window

[18:44:32] <Thump> motaka2: ????
[18:44:58] <motaka2> Thump: Sorry, 	I dont know why the function at line 37 doesnt work on this script unless I copy the body of function formGetData() in it and replace $form with $(this) in it. http://pastebin.com/j8ZgfTzj
[18:45:48] <Thump> motaka2: i'm in the 'help me' basket, not the 'help you' basket, sorry.
[18:47:08] <motaka2> Thump: I know you are not a basket!
[18:47:46] <Thump> motaka2: But i'm in a basket
[18:48:07] <Thump> motaka2: the please 'help me' basket.
[18:49:34] <motaka2> Thump: lemme see your problem
[18:51:14] <Thump> motaka2: scroll up and you will see it!
[18:51:44] <VectorX> Thump $(this) does not refer to anything in that context
[18:51:58] <Thump> VectorX: why not?
[18:52:53] <VectorX> why didnt you do $(this).attr('data') ?
[18:52:58] <VectorX> if it has context
[18:53:30] <Thump> VectorX: i did: see  alert( $(this).attr('data') );
[18:53:38] <VectorX> if ( $(this).attr('data') != '' )
[18:53:43] <VectorX> that would not mean anything
[18:53:50] <VectorX> give wher you have your code
[18:53:53] <VectorX> given
[18:54:11] <Thump> VectorX: no, i got: if ( $('a.foo').attr('data') != '' )
[18:54:38] <VectorX> yeah so you would have to do $('a.foo').attr('data')
[18:54:51] <VectorX> to alert it
[18:55:28] <Thump> VectorX: yes, but i don't understand why i can't use $(this) as the if statement locks you into that context
[18:55:41] <VectorX> no it doesnt
[18:56:53] <Thump> VectorX: strange. i remember being able to do that before with my other codes.
[18:57:54] <VectorX> this would lock it in http://jsfiddle.net/HHg5d/11/
[18:58:22] <VectorX> so you probably had something like that when you previously did it
[18:58:50] <VectorX> anyone know the effect for the thumbnails in the google chrome browser when you are on the "most visited" page and resize the window, stuff moves around
[19:22:45] <motaka2_> aanyone there?

[19:26:56] <VectorX> motaka2_ yeah, bit busy with what im doing

[21:02:10] <relipse> can you look at it?
[21:02:52] <wroathe> Have a fiddle or a live site I can look at?
[21:03:02] <relipse> yeah

[21:06:52] <jomesili> HI guys, need help with trying to get a jsfiddle project to work locally
[21:07:20] <relipse> wroathe: yes, choose filter, the drop down menu can not be clicked it is unresponsive
[21:07:22] <relipse> etc
[21:11:42] <relipse> any luck wroathe
[21:12:55] <wroathe> Looking into it
[21:12:59] <wroathe> This code is terrible
[21:13:09] <wroathe> Whoever wrote this should be publicly shamed.
[21:14:54] <shoky> wroathe: that's not very nice :\ or helpful
[21:15:04] <relipse> whats wrong with it wroath
[21:15:06] <relipse> shoky!
[21:15:07] <relipse> you are here

[21:16:18] <shoky> that makes 2 of us
[21:16:21] <relipse> wroathe: that is datatables.net doing that
[21:16:46] <wroathe> relipse: Yeah. That's why you can't click on it.
[21:16:49] <relipse> shoky can you go to jim.clearbugs.com login as test_test_test admin testtest and help me with why my Choose Filter split button isnt working
[21:17:06] <relipse> wroathe: i dont understand they are not near each other in the code?
[21:17:30] <relipse> wroathe: wow good call on that one
[21:17:44] <relipse> what do I do? since I cannot modify datatables?
[21:17:59] <wroathe> apply a higher z-index to that <ul>
[21:18:18] <relipse> excellent idea
[21:19:02] <wroathe> shoky: Publicly shaming someone is always more fun than being nice :)

[21:20:11] <relipse> thanks wroathe
[21:30:23] <scar> i built a mobile site with viewport at 480px. and everything is fine with my input box stretchijng horizontally, but when i click to select the box an edit, it makes the site enlarge so it has a scroll left right-- any idea?
[21:31:04] <shoky> scar: what's the question?
[21:31:14] <scar> how do i prevent this from happeing? lol
[21:31:20] <scar> not sure if its mobile specific css
[21:31:21] <shoky> which part?
[21:31:28] <shoky> oh didnt notice the mobile part
[21:31:36] <scar> tapping input box and it enlarges / offsets
[21:31:57] <wroathe> Does it enlarge or does your mobile browser zoom in and focus?
[21:31:58] <shoky> make it smaller with css?
[21:38:13] <scar> wroathe, mobile browser zooms in and focuses :D
[21:38:45] <wroathe> Does the :D mean you fixed it?
[21:40:24] <scar> wroathe, nope it means u correctly described it haha
[21:40:27] <scar> sry i was tryin to mess w/ it
[21:41:49] <wroathe> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1">
[21:42:38] <wroathe> Actually
[21:42:41] <wroathe> That probably won't fix it
[21:42:52] <tw2113> that'll remove zooming
[21:42:52] <darkPassenger> guys
[21:42:58] <tw2113> and gals darkPassenger
[21:43:04] <wroathe> user-scalable=0
[21:43:08] <wroathe> That will remove zooming
[21:43:22] <darkPassenger> i I have an horrific regex nightmare on my bloody hands
[21:43:32] <wroathe> I love regular expressions
[21:43:37] <tw2113> the initial scale equaling max would too
[21:43:38] <darkPassenger> oh really ?
[21:44:01] <darkPassenger> wroathe: do you think youd be willing to help me find a pattern ?
[21:44:10] <wroathe> (?:sure)
[21:44:34] <darkPassenger> wroathe : private ?
[21:44:38] <wroathe> Nope
[21:44:41] <wroathe> In here
[21:44:44] <darkPassenger> okidoo
[21:45:43] <darkPassenger> it's 12 char long, the first four character needs to be letters either in upper or lower case(doesnt matter) the rest (8 char) must be single 0-9 digits
[21:45:52] <scar> hm
[21:46:20] <scar> tw2113, so initial-scale=maximum-scale -- or have both params equal?
[21:46:37] <wroathe> /[a-zA-Z]{4}\d{8}/
[21:46:41] <wroathe> or something like that
[21:46:45] <scar> where can i find info on the viewport meta that you RECOMMEND?
[21:47:03] <wroathe> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag
[21:47:07] <wroathe> MDN rocks
[21:47:32] <darkPassenger> oh yeah thanks !"
[21:47:52] <tw2113> scar, logic says an initial scale being 1 and maximum scale being 1 would kind of remove wiggle room
[21:48:08] <scar> well that is true
[21:48:09] <scar> :D
[21:50:17] <wroathe> Also, there's a #regex irc channel darkPassenger
[21:50:25] <wroathe> Those people get off on writing regular expressions.
[21:51:54] <darkPassenger> lol
[21:52:06] <darkPassenger> dude
[21:52:06] <omg|its|otr> I have a page (here: http://diplomacy.depotwarehouse.net/) that onclick one of my divs (the bubbles under the picture), I change the .attr('src') of an img tag. However, when I do this, the browser jumps back to the top of the image. I don't want this to happen, I just want the image to quietly change. How should I do this?
[21:52:12] <darkPassenger> im heading right there
[21:57:21] <scar> when trying to pad the screen is it besst to use em or px
[21:58:16] <tw2113> dead bodies
[22:00:37] <scar> nice
[22:00:38] <scar> lets do it
[22:03:28] <scar> is a mobile device's location obtained thru js only?
[22:04:19] <miCSu> is there a way to join values or .text()s of elements with jquery? just thinking that $(<element>).join() will try to join the objects and $(<element>).text() is already a single text
[22:04:42] <scar> woops wrng chan
[22:04:50] <scar> is a mobile device's location obtained thru js only?
[22:05:03] <scar> oh crap nvm rigth channel hah
[22:05:06] <scar> dang xchat
[22:06:47] <wroathe> miCSu: If you just want one contiguous text blob from all of the elements in a jQuery object then .text() should already do taht
[22:07:03] <scar> i thought i was in #css the whole time lol
[22:07:11] <scar> until i meant to change to jquery
[22:07:57] <miCSu> wroathe: yup, but .join() joins the texts seperated by comma if I remember correctly
[22:08:47] <wroathe> miCSu: You're trying to get an array of strings
[22:08:48] <wroathe> ?
[22:10:18] <miCSu> wroathe: yes
[22:10:38] <wroathe> var contents = []; $('.foo, .bar, .baz').each(function() { var $this = $(this); contents.push($this.text()); });
[22:10:44] <miCSu> just thinking if there's some other way than loop
[22:10:46] <shoky> .map plz
[22:11:17] <wroathe> shoky: Whoops, yeah. I forgot about .map
[22:12:59] <wroathe> $('.foo, .bar, .baz').map(function () { var $this = $(this); return $this.text(); });
[22:13:34] <shoky> .get() on the end to get a pure array
[22:14:01] <wroathe> toArray() also
[22:14:02] <shoky> why the var? :p
[22:14:11] <wroathe> Just a style thing. I like doing it that way.
[22:15:20] <shoky> didn't know there's a public toArray
[22:15:24] <wroathe> Often times in callbacks I end up using $(this) more than once. A) It keeps with the single var pattern. B) Avoids unnecessary calls to the jQuery constructor C) $this goes out of scope and is collected anyway
[22:15:35] <shoky> (but yeah, i see it now :P)
[22:17:12] <shoky> yeah if using it more than once then i use a var too
[22:20:08] <miCSu> thanks guys, that was it
[22:22:42] <wroathe> They should add the ability to provide a string argument with a method name to .map()
[22:22:59] <wroathe> $('.foo, .bar, .baz').map('text').toArray();
[22:25:56] <tw2113> make your own and submit it to core
[22:26:14] <sacho> if you're going to do that, I'd rather just extend .text()
[22:26:21] <sacho> $().text() -> array of text contents
[22:28:36] <wroathe> sacho: Yeah, adding a string argument to map though would provide for some really concise one liners for multiple use cases though :)
[22:28:49] <wroathe> extending text just solves the text to array problem
[22:29:41] <sacho> wroathe, I think most of the use cases are covered by extending the functions that refuse to return collections
[22:29:51] <shoky> that's usually called pluck
[22:32:56] <shoky> (e.g. in underscore/lodash)
[22:33:14] <wroathe> Just one thought: var dataObjects = $('.foo, .bar, .baz').map('data').toArray();
[22:33:59] <wroathe> sacho: But yeah. Extending is probably a good way of doing that.
[22:34:04] <shoky> you talk about being concise but use toArray instead of get and use unnecessary vars heh
[22:34:52] <shoky> don't see much use for .map('data')
[22:35:02] <wroathe> Well, in this case I'm trying to convert a jQuery object into an array. For some reason I've always thought of .get as being an accessor for individual elements.
[22:35:39] <darkPassenger> at least you dont have a rubber dome keyboard to deal withy
[22:35:47] <darkPassenger> duh sorry guys
[22:35:54] <wroathe> LOL
[22:35:55] <wroathe> What?
[22:36:01] <shoky> derp
[22:36:25] <darkPassenger> lol
[22:36:28] <darkPassenger> yeah thank shoky  :P
[22:37:04] <shoky> yeah...
[22:37:30] <darkPassenger> I was telling a friend about the joy of typing on a mechanical keyboard
[22:38:03] <darkPassenger> and its no hipster shit
[22:39:22] <shoky> better not be!
[22:40:01] <darkPassenger> mech keyboards are like a joy to type on
[22:46:12] <scar> what would cause window.location to not work on mobile only?
[22:50:00] <scar> ive tried window.location.href adn .replace
[22:51:59] <scar> wth even $(location).attr()
[22:57:30] <scar> i discovered navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition is failing on mobile
[23:03:02] <holymacaroons> it seems like the last 5% of an app takes 90% of the time.
