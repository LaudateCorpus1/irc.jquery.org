[17:21:38] <SpeakerToMeat> Hello peoples
[17:23:52] <SpeakerToMeat> Stupid question.. I want to make a form, where some parts are "arrays", so I'd like to be able to add live new fields to the form with a plus sign. And remove some with a minus... am I right that jqueryui can help me with this task in editing the dom? that is, adding blocks (coupel divs) and removing them?
[22:22:53] <ringzer0> is there an easier way to recursively check if somethings defined if it's a nested object (example of crappy way to do it): https://pastebin.com/JbyvBrYR
[22:25:32] <ringzer0> dang; paste is gone.  I want to avoid nesting this: if (typeof x !== 'undefined') { if (type of x.y ...) { if (type of x.y.z ... ) { ... do something ... }}} ... is there a way to recursively check a potential nested object?  I'd like to just check the x.y.z variable
