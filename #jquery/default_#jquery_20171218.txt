[01:28:12] <Cork> maxagaz: 1.x has ie < 9 support, 2.x is without that compatibility layer and 3.x is like 2.x but with some api breakages
[01:28:39] <Cork> simplified, you can check the history on blog.jquery.com if you want a more deep dive
[04:04:32] <alexbodn> hello :)
[04:10:30] <hellyeah-food> finally
[04:45:54] <Guest93849> Hello. I want to check checkboxes with specific data-* attribute. I found the following: $('input[type="checkbox"][data-z="1"]').prop('checked', true);
[04:46:17] <Guest93849> Is it possible to do something like $('input[type="checkbox"][data-z=array_of_values]').prop('checked', true); ?
[04:46:34] <Cork> Guest93849: use .filter(function() {})
[04:47:45] <Cork> Guest93849: use $(':checkbox.filter(function() { return array.includes($(this).data('z')); });
[04:47:50] <Cork> bah...
[04:47:59] <Cork> Guest93849: use $(':checkbox').filter(function() { return array.includes($(this).data('z')); });
[04:49:05] <Cork> alternatively you can write it as $(':checkbox').filter('[data-z="1"],[data-z="2"],[data-z="3"],[data-z="4"]')
[05:20:25] <adnn> Easiest way to find all elements that don't have any child elements and delete them ? thx
[05:21:06] <moveax> use google, find solution on stackoverflow
[05:21:24] <moveax> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11061594/get-all-elements-without-child-node-in-jquery
[05:21:53] <adnn> I just went there actually, thanks
[05:22:00] <adnn> sometimes my reflex is to come here before going to google
[05:22:01] <moveax> yw
[05:22:17] <moveax> google before asking is a learned skill ;)
[05:22:32] <adnn> you're right :)
[05:23:36] <Cork> hmm well...
[05:23:55] <Cork> adnn: are the elements completely empty? meaning no text nodes either? (space)
[05:24:08] <Cork> if yes you can just use $('*:empty').remove()
[05:24:29] <Cork> csswg is working on a :blank replacement but it isn't standard yet
[05:25:21] <Cork> https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/1967
[05:25:57] <adnn> Cork: I think the stackoverflow solution is more comprehensive since it takes into account spaces
[05:26:22] <Cork> adnn: sure, but it is also MUCH more costly to run
[05:27:00] <Cork> so it is a solution if you have to support it, but if you can avoid it use :empty
[05:27:30] <adnn> I'm not worried about microperformance (given that it's THAT much of a heavy task under the hood (?))
[05:27:44] <adnn> depends on the page size ofc, not very big
[05:28:03] <adnn> I'll test both
[05:30:56] <Cork> how costly it is depends on how often you run it; :has isn't in the fast css profile for a reason...
[06:55:08] <Clarissol> Hey guys
[06:55:08] <Clarissol> I
[06:55:14] <Clarissol> Please help
[06:55:27] <Clarissol> I'm using this snippet of jquery to disable/enable scrolling on my site when a div is clicked
[06:55:37] <Clarissol> https://thepasteb.in/p/1jhnGJQOqA0hB
[06:55:41] <Clarissol> But it's not working
[06:55:49] <Clarissol> Actually - the scroll is disabled
[06:55:57] <Clarissol> But it isn't enabled once the div is clicked again
[07:19:51] <AdamPDotty> The second handler returns true which gets wildly ignored after the first handler already set nothing to happen.
[07:20:11] <AdamPDotty> *wildly*
[07:23:43] <AdamPDotty> Best idea I can come up with spontaneously is a local variable. Then if (preventScrolling) e.preventDefault(); preventScrolling = !preventScrolling;
[09:44:04] <poboy> a syntax issue?  https://jsfiddle.net/yorhdf1d/    If #ssr_files does not equal 'all_open'  then I want to show the other div
[09:52:13] <Cork> poboy: https://jsfiddle.net/yorhdf1d/1/
[09:52:29] <Cork> poboy: i would recommend adding a class instead of using show/hide/toggle though
[09:53:55] <poboy> What's the reason for doing so?  Forgive my ignorance
[09:54:01] <poboy> and thanks for that fiddle
[09:54:08] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/yorhdf1d/2/
[09:54:30] <Cork> it means you have a more stable place to store the state of the element
[09:54:54] <Cork> .hide/.show/.toggle stores the state as a display: value
[09:55:16] <Cork> but it means the old value has to be stored in a javascript variable (or it will be lost and the old display value can't be restored on show)
[09:55:26] <Cork> a class doesn't have that problem
[09:55:49] <Cork> and it also means you get a contextual meaning to the state on the element
[09:56:09] <Cork> instead of just a display true/false you can have ex. like what i did pick-data
[09:56:22] <Cork> there are more reasons then those, but ya :)
[09:57:09] <Cork> (if i remember correctly show/hide is deprecated for jquery 4.0 for this exact reason, but i might remember wrong)
[09:57:18] <poboy> thanks, that's very helpful!
[10:38:48] <benm> Anyone know if there is a typeahead or autocomplete with pagination?
[11:26:27] <dimi1947> I am trying to style the checkbox that is selected...I am trying to do that with the code you see at lines 18-21 https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/vpz8o60n/  but I cannot,I do not kbow what is wrong here
[12:48:54] <taplar> dimi1947: line 20.  radio_group is a div.  it wouldn't be checked
[12:49:49] <dimi1947> taplar:ok...what should I do then?
[12:50:27] <taplar> i'm assuming you are wanting to check if the input is checked
[12:51:07] <dimi1947> I want to style it IF IT IS NOT CHECKED...sorry I was not clear in that respect
[12:51:18] <dimi1947> to inform the user
[12:51:28] <taplar> so check the input instead of the radio group
[12:51:30] <robertmaxrees> but only when they press submit, right?
[12:51:53] <dimi1947> only when they press submit.yes
[12:52:20] <dimi1947> the style "button" below plays that role
[12:52:43] <taplar> compare line 20 to line 10 and line 4
[12:54:28] <dimi1947> taplar:you have to give me some more info here
[12:54:35] <taplar> i just did
[12:54:43] <robertmaxrees> link to the fiddle?
[12:54:50] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/vpz8o60n/
[12:55:02] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/vpz8o60n/28/
[12:55:22] <taplar> k, same issue
[12:55:33] <taplar> you're checking if the div is checked, not the input
[12:55:49] <taplar> if you compare line 20 to 10 and 4, both 10 and 4 are checking the input
[12:56:01] <robertmaxrees> ^
[12:56:10] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 look at what $radioGroups is set to.
[12:56:17] <dimi1947> I got that...how can I check for the input and NOT the div?
[12:56:33] <taplar> you mean like line 10 and 4 are?
[12:56:34] <robertmaxrees> well
[12:56:43] <taplar> ...
[12:56:44] <robertmaxrees> ^ you're already doing it in some other places.
[12:57:23] <dimi1947> hmm
[12:57:29] <robertmaxrees> okay think of it this way.
[12:57:31] <robertmaxrees> $('.radio_group').prop('checked')
[12:57:52] <robertmaxrees> what elements have that .radio_group class?
[13:00:43] <dimi1947> radioboxes
[13:00:55] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[13:01:02] <robertmaxrees> <div class="radio_group">
[13:02:00] <dimi1947> I do not understand what are you trying to say...within class radio group there are input boxes
[13:02:12] <taplar> he asked what element has that class
[13:02:16] <taplar> not what was inside
[13:02:45] <taplar> $('.radio_group') will only find elements that have that class
[13:02:50] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 you're doing $('.radio_group').prop('checked') - this is literally saying "see if the first element with the class .radio_group has a checked attribute.
[13:02:53] <robertmaxrees> but that's not what youi want.
[13:03:12] <robertmaxrees> every other time you do that same filter, you'
[13:03:24] <robertmaxrees> *you're using a different jquery object.
[13:04:21] <robertmaxrees> check out your groupHasCheckedBox and style functions.  what's different with those filters vs this new one you've made?
[13:04:44] <dimi1947> I have not got completely the picture....but I do understand there is something wrong here
[13:05:21] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bmafswnc/
[13:05:32] <taplar> the element that you check prop('checked') on -must- be a checkbox or a radio
[13:05:32] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/bmafswnc/1/
[13:05:36] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:05:53] <robertmaxrees> in that second fiddle, what's the different in the two filters?
[13:05:54] <taplar> it cannot be a parent of one of those two things, it -must- be that thing
[13:07:07] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 let's reframe this a little.
[13:07:18] <robertmaxrees> in one filter, you do return $(this).prop('checked');
[13:07:20] <robertmaxrees> right?
[13:07:27] <dimi1947> yes
[13:07:34] <robertmaxrees> what is $(this) in that case?
[13:07:50] <Levin^> hi there
[13:08:01] <Levin^> I'm having a bit of trouble with a XML feed I received
[13:08:15] <Levin^> it brings broken markup to my website
[13:08:26] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ before you go any further.
[13:08:27] <Levin^> so I was thinking if I could treat it with jquery
[13:08:31] <Levin^> oh
[13:08:32] <robertmaxrees> hahaha
[13:08:39] <Levin^> :(
[13:08:44] <robertmaxrees> you don't want to go down that path.
[13:08:51] <dimi1947> robertmaxrees:I have the same question with you....to what this $this refers to?
[13:08:51] <robertmaxrees> jquery is meant to work with valid markup.
[13:09:09] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 well...
[13:09:14] <robertmaxrees> you do return $(this).find('input').filter(function() {
[13:09:37] <Levin^> robertmaxrees: well.. it brings this artifact: <p/>
[13:09:54] <Levin^> so I was thinking if I could remove it..
[13:10:17] <robertmaxrees> Levin^ wait
[13:10:31] <Levin^> it appears alone, without relation to other elements
[13:10:31] <robertmaxrees> that sounds like something you should fix in your backend.
[13:10:38] <Levin^> oh?
[13:10:48] <robertmaxrees> yeah, that's valid XML, but you're intending to consume and display it on the frontend.
[13:10:55] <robertmaxrees> so your backend should be tweaked to not include it.
[13:11:06] <Levin^> hmm
[13:11:09] <taplar> dimi1947: inside a filter, 'this' references one of the elements from the jQuery object you are iterating over.
[13:11:20] <robertmaxrees> ^
[13:11:36] <taplar> so if you did something like $('p').filter(function(){ /* in here 'this' will be a p element */ })
[13:11:40] <dimi1947> taplar:yes I know that
[13:11:49] <taplar> ok, so look at you're filter
[13:11:54] <robertmaxrees> ^^^
[13:11:55] <taplar> what is the 'this' there?
[13:12:14] <taplar> what is the filter operating off of?
[13:12:30] <dimi1947> taplar:I am lost litle with the code...to which fiddle and line you are referring to?
[13:12:58] <dimi1947> so I can answer the q
[13:12:58] <robertmaxrees> your fiddle.
[13:13:00] <taplar> any of hte filters
[13:13:02] <taplar> *the
[13:13:11] <taplar> any filter that has a 'this' in it
[13:13:13] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/vpz8o60n/30/  this one?
[13:13:28] <robertmaxrees> that works.
[13:13:35] <robertmaxrees> *for the point he's trying to make.
[13:13:48] <dimi1947> what line precisely?
[13:13:58] <robertmaxrees> any of the filters.
[13:13:59] <taplar> find a filter, if there is a 'this' in it, that'll work
[13:14:24] <dimi1947> ok...let us go at line 2...
[13:14:37] <robertmaxrees> O.o
[13:14:52] <taplar> line 2 isn't a filter
[13:15:10] <taplar> .filter(  ... )
[13:15:25] <dimi1947> it is the point where the function begins...the filter is in line 3
[13:15:31] <robertmaxrees> no.
[13:16:01] <dimi1947> in line 3 the word filter is mentioned...why do you say no?
[13:16:02] <robertmaxrees> you're really conflating this.
[13:16:14] <robertmaxrees> oh, i thought you said line 2 hahahah
[13:16:14] <robertmaxrees> my bvad.
[13:16:22] <robertmaxrees> i'ma shut up.
[13:16:41] <dimi1947> bvad=error?
[13:16:46] <taplar> yeah, line 3.  so what is that filter operating off of?
[13:17:03] <robertmaxrees> *bad
[13:17:47] <dimi1947> to be honest...it is the first time I see code like this...there is no selector there...in the beginning of the function
[13:18:02] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:18:16] <taplar> When I say "operating off of" I mean what preceeds the method call
[13:18:28] <robertmaxrees> ^ put differently, where are you calling that function?
[13:18:46] <taplar> $('input').val(1);  <-- If I asked what val operated off of there, you'd say an input field
[13:18:55] <dimi1947> hmmmm
[13:19:20] <dimi1947> the function is called at 22...correct?
[13:19:45] <taplar> how did we jump from line 3 to 22?
[13:20:02] <robertmaxrees> he's trying to understand what $(this) is on line 3
[13:20:16] <taplar> ah, ok
[13:20:46] <taplar> sure, the logic chain will originate from line 22
[13:21:01] <taplar> but within that method, the filter is being called off of a specific selector
[13:21:11] <robertmaxrees> ^ the .find() is the key here.
[13:22:21] <dimi1947> it is a  mess
[13:22:27] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vpz8o60n/32/
[13:22:29] <robertmaxrees> look at it this way.
[13:22:34] <robertmaxrees> does that make it a bit clearer?
[13:22:47] <robertmaxrees> https://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/vpz8o60n/33/ maybe this is even better
[13:23:53] <robertmaxrees> look down at lines 21-27
[13:24:29] <dimi1947> give me a minute or 2
[13:26:19] <dimi1947> so...in your code $this refers to .radio_group'...
[13:26:41] <taplar> which one?
[13:27:01] <dimi1947> line 23
[13:27:13] <taplar> yep, what about the other one?
[13:27:30] <dimi1947> at line 24?
[13:27:38] <taplar> yep
[13:27:59] <dimi1947> it refers to a checked input...am I correct?
[13:28:17] <taplar> it refers to an input, but we don't know if it's check or not yet
[13:28:52] <taplar> but the point is that you are calling prop('checked') on an input, which is correct
[13:29:13] <taplar> where as the fiddle you were having an issue with, you were trying to call prop('checked') on $('.group_input')
[13:29:16] <dimi1947> taplar:ok I got that now
[13:30:32] <dimi1947> now...to fix it
[13:33:57] <robertmaxrees> dimi1947 I highly recommend hitting up learn.jquery.com and going through some tutorials btw.
[14:19:54] <dimi1947> https://jsfiddle.net/fiddlehunt/vpz8o60n/43/  line 8-11 it does not work
[14:20:52] <taplar> looks like it's working to me.  the inline style is being added
[14:22:16] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:26:06] <dimi1947> I do not see any red background being added
[14:29:57] <dimi1947> yes it is working
[15:38:56] <taplar> good times, good times
