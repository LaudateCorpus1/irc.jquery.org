[03:34:12] <Xtrivity> Hi guys, Looking for some guidance. I have a sample url: "http://mysite.com/form_image_edit.php?img_id=33", now I just want to extract the base path from that: http://mysite.com .... what is the best way to accomplish this? Please keep in mind I cant use windows.location etc as it's a string that's being passed.
[03:53:09] <Kitsune> I can't seem to split this string properly, http://pastebin.com/nyHFAj0a I'm not seeing what's wrong. The variable logs fine showing the string I want to split. Whelp! Comment show console logs
[04:00:06] <Kartagis> Kitsune: pastebin on jsfiddle.net
[04:04:18] <Kitsune> There: http://jsfiddle.net/kitsune/h4jrjx45/3/

[04:14:11] <narcan> anyone know of a javascript library to emulate a UIScrollView ? looking for snap to page functionality
[04:18:21] <Uhkis> Kitsune: 1) $(this) doesn't refer to any of those divs 2) it's split(), not split[]
[04:20:56] <Kitsune> oh the code is inside a click, my bad for not adding it in the jsfiddle just now. and I'm stupid with the split[] baffled how i just couldnt see the brackets there. Should've called it a night. It's working now, thanks!
[04:23:48] <Uhkis> yeah, sleep helps ;)
[04:27:02] <Kitsune> Lesson learned

[05:02:21] <flks> hey there
[05:02:33] <arthurvr> hey flks
[05:02:36] <arthurvr> what’s up?
[05:02:53] <flks> haha got a problem about a function actually :D
[05:03:15] <arthurvr> what exactly? jsbin or a fiddle would be handy?
[05:03:25] <flks> yeap I made one: http://jsfiddle.net/asb39sff/1/
[05:03:36] <arthurvr> awesome
[05:03:56] <flks> I have a slider and a slide position like: 1/3 which is animated when changing
[05:04:29] <flks> it's working for the first slide but I'm looking for animating it for the whole slider and get 2/3, x/3… animated
[05:06:49] <Expel> Hello, I'm trying to figure out how to load a page using Ajax function, this is what I got now and now it loads the whole head and header, no idea why tho: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/c779ebbcde03da0d9962
[05:08:17] <flks> Expel: hey! I think you should filter your request like that: post_link + " #div"
[05:08:38] <flks> or post_link + " #div > *"
[05:09:02] <Expel> flks: Alright, thank you, I'll try that!
[05:09:29] <flks> https://api.jquery.com/load/
[05:09:56] <flks> arthurvr: got the problem? :p
[05:10:09] <arthurvr> flks: yeah I understand your problem
[05:10:28] <arthurvr> flks: but I never used swiper.js so am probably not the right person to answer
[05:10:51] <flks> actually it's not really about Swiper or GSAP but jQuery because of the content cloning etc
[05:11:06] <flks> the function is just a callback
[05:14:02] <Expel> flks: It's still the same... I used this line: $("#main-content").load(post_link + "#main-header");
[05:14:18] <flks> you just forgot a space just after the first "
[05:14:24] <flks> that will do the trick
[05:16:29] <Expel> $(" #main-content").load(post_link + "#main-header"); Like that?
[05:16:39] <Expel> I don't get it, sorry
[05:16:50] <flks> $(" #main-content").load(post_link + " #main-header");
[05:17:15] <flks> it's all about the load :)
[05:19:31] <Expel> Hmm... Confusing that the space was the whole deal, lol. I'm using the WP plugin called "Ajax Load More", now that's messed up since it stopped showing my whole posts
[05:20:21] <sash_> Expel: If you are not sure about your jQuery queries and constructions, console.log them and you can find errors like that ;)
[05:20:58] <Expel> sash_: I'm kinda new to jQuery, as you can see, lol. How can I console them up?
[05:21:19] <sash_> Expel: http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_output.asp
[05:21:50] <sash_> Expel: Using console.log("foo"); you can read that stuff in your browser console.
[05:22:06] <Expel> sash_: Yeah, I know about the console.log() function, but how do I show the errors? Yeah, what should I put inside the brackets ()?
[05:22:45] <sash_> Expel: You could for example write console.log(post_link + "#main-header") and you would see the mistake you did.
[05:23:03] <Expel> sash_: Oh, alright! Big thanks, bud :)
[05:25:00] <Expel> sash_: I get this error: 'console' is not defined. — column 9
[05:25:11] <Expel> Why do I get it, it's right?
[05:27:06] <sash_> Expel: Which browser?
[05:27:17] <Expel> sash_: Google Chrome, latest version
[05:28:28] <sash_> Expel: Well, no idea. Does https://jsfiddle.net/thk2pr9s/ work?
[05:29:34] <Expel> sash_: Yep, that one works just fine. I'm using WP plugin called "Ajax Load More", as I mentioned before, do you think maybe WP it selfs mess something up?
[05:29:57] <sash_> No, I use console.log all the time when I create wordpress themes
[05:30:22] <Expel> sash_: Well, should I try to send you whole my .js code?
[05:30:59] <sash_> Try to create a jsfiddle.
[05:31:11] <sash_> And have a look if that works
[05:31:47] <Expel> sash_: Just take a quick look at the code, if it's not much to ask: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/05b946a1acf7d3544f8c
[05:33:54] <sash_> try putting the console.log before your ajax calls. Perhaps, something messes that up. But I have really no idea why this happens.
[05:36:28] <Expel> sash_: Alright, I'll try that. Thanks :)
[06:00:01] <ph88> i want to do some effect when ajax is done but minimum wait 0.5 seconds how do i do that ?
[06:00:22] <arthurvr> ?g setTimeout
[06:00:23] <b-ot> arthurvr: WindowTimers.setTimeout() - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowTimers/setTimeout
[06:00:36] <arthurvr> ph88 just use a timeout in your callback? ^
[06:03:55] <ph88> arthurvr: i know timeout ... but what do you mean "use timeout in callback"  ??
[06:04:14] <arthurvr> well in the `success` callback, you can use a setTimeout
[06:04:32] <ph88> but then it will be the ajax time + the timeout time
[06:04:49] <arthurvr> yes that’s what you were asking isn’t it?
[06:04:53] <ph88> no
[06:05:32] <arthurvr> well you can just use timeout still then
[06:05:37] <ph88> if ajax takes 0.2 seconds then the effect should come after 0.5 seconds (0.2 -> 0.5)  .. .similar 0.4 -> 0.5     0.5 -> 0.5  but then 0.6 -> 0.6
[06:11:12] <ph88> arthurvr:  i have this now http://pastebin.com/nWagWqLP  can it be done less clunky ?
[06:11:35] <ph88> i don't really like with to work with that boolean to check if the timer is still running
[06:14:04] <ph88> this logic doesn't even work right
[06:17:58] <ph88> arthurvr: ??
[06:18:25] <ph88> i have this now http://pastebin.com/v2x10LzC  but i need 2 bookkeeping variables ... it's just ugly
[07:53:36] <se0__> hey
[07:53:58] <se0__> arschmitz: I have a jQuery mobile question something isn't working
[07:54:51] <arthurvr> se0__: is it just a support question? Big chance other people in this channel will be able to help ;) What’s up?
[07:56:11] <drej> isnt there a #jquery-mobile or something?
[07:56:32] <arthurvr> drej: nope there isn't
[07:56:44] <arthurvr> drej: jquery mobile and jQuery UI questions are totally welcome in here ;)
[07:56:59] <se0__> channel topic says so
[07:57:24] <drej> i wasnt trying to insinuate that it's inappropriate here, just that there's (maybe, but apparently not) a place where some people who specialize in it might know more
[07:57:26] <drej> that's all
[07:57:30] <drej> sheesh, its sunday guys, relax
[07:57:30] <drej> :)
[07:57:51] <arthurvr> drej: you that was a totally valid question, but there isn’t (at least not that I know)
[07:58:14] <arthurvr> s/you/yeah
[07:58:23] <drej> group hug!
[07:58:32] <arthurvr> o/
[07:59:53] <arthurvr> se0__: what was your question by the way?
[08:00:59] <lilsammy> Anyone know if its possible to do a specific if type statement on only actual events in fullcalendar rather than new ones I am adding via mouse click?
[08:18:35] <earational> hey
[08:18:53] <arthurvr> here earational
[09:58:18] <PCatinean> What would be a good dropdown select with images plugin, or should a custom script be used?
[10:03:24] <CssNoob> Any thoughts about this article? http://learntocodewith.me/web-dev/front-end-developer-skills/
[10:05:41] <arthurvr> CssNoob: let me take a look
[10:06:59] <CssNoob> arthurvr ..
[10:07:12] <arthurvr> what?
[10:08:26] <arthurvr> seems like a pretty junk article honestly
[10:08:47] <arthurvr> haha ”Package Management ->This is Bower.”
[10:09:19] <arthurvr> everything in the article is okay but in general it’s not that of a quality thing, CssNoob ^
[10:09:36] <arthurvr> there are some points I personally disagree upon but that’s just my humble opinion
[10:11:14] <arthurvr> CssNoob: also seems a little outdated
[10:11:34] <arthurvr> CssNoob: if you’re searching for articles like that you’d better read http://rmurphey.com/blog/2015/03/23/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers-2015/
[10:11:51] <CssNoob> arthurvr THANKS
[10:29:15] <rohanrhu> hi
[10:29:21] <arthurvr> hey rohanrhu
[10:29:36] <rohanrhu> how can i carry a data over event bubbling?
[10:31:08] <rohanrhu> i should detect is the event bubbled from a specified element?
[10:31:51] <rohanrhu> i modified event object but it did not be arrived
[10:32:28] <stephen> rohanrhu: on the event handler, it will receive arguments
[10:32:40] <stephen> One of them will have a .target property
[10:33:01] <rohanrhu> stephen: is it possible carry data over event bubbling?
[10:34:36] <rohanrhu> when click to .element_1 .element_1_1 handler will be called for .element_1_1 and i should set a data it should be arrived to .element_1's handler
[11:04:58] <stephen> rohanrhu: Look up jquery'
[11:05:04] <stephen> 's .trigger method
[11:05:14] <stephen> You can set data that way
[11:05:48] <stephen> You'll have to wrap the target handler in a trigger inside the first handler
[11:18:46] <rohanrhu> stephen: i set event.originalEvent
[11:19:19] <rohanrhu> it is being carried during event propagation
[11:19:44] <stephen> Ah, that's called delegation
[11:19:50] <stephen> jquery has stuff for that too
[11:19:54] <stephen> look it up
[11:20:22] <rohanrhu> stephen: is there another way?
[11:20:45] <stephen> Why?
[11:20:53] <stephen> What's the problem with event delegation
[11:21:36] <stephen> http://api.jquery.com/delegate/
[11:23:30] <rohanrhu> stephen: there is a box it be close when click out of the box
[11:23:56] <rohanrhu> stephen: i was stopping the propagation when click to box's opener button
[11:24:35] <rohanrhu> stephen: but now i delegate another button from another top container
[11:25:26] <rohanrhu> so i check where is from the click event in html's click handler
[11:25:49] <rohanrhu> if the event bubbled from the opener button it will not close the box
[11:26:21] <rohanrhu> event.originalEvent is being carried during event propagation :D
[11:26:25] <stephen> Ah, in this case we are not using bubbling
[11:26:49] <stephen> bubbling happens when elements are in parent/child relationship
[11:26:57] <stephen> Delegation fakes that
[11:27:12] <stephen> So, I take it everything is working?
[11:29:22] <stephen> https://scontent-lax.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/10484971_10152521191195552_4087239055573336751_n.jpg?oh=4426cbdb895f221c2127e2de7d9ababf&oe=55CB9D79
[13:23:22] <lungaro> Is there something wrong with fetching a static json file (jplayer playlist) and it not being parsed as JSON using $.getJSON ?
[13:23:47] <lungaro> its driving me mad. I see the web server serving the object, yet jplayer does nothing
[13:41:52] <BillCriswell> lungaro: What does the content type say?
[13:42:03] <BillCriswell> Also, sure it's valid json?
[13:48:14] <lungaro> Yeah, its valid json and iI tried both .js and .json extensions
[13:48:32] <lungaro> so content types application/javascript and text/json
[13:48:57] <lungaro> i dont really know the tools to debug this
[13:52:49] <lungaro> here is a simple test http://grepped.org/test/
[13:53:05] <lungaro> oh crap, didn't include playlist sec
[13:56:52] <lungaro> http://grepped.org/test/ is updated w/ the example now. maybe my JSON is wrong somehow
[13:57:02] <lungaro> can I turn jquery in debug moide? cause it should tell me if there is a problem =/
[13:57:38] <Souhail> Hi !
[13:59:48] <BillCriswell> lungaro: validate your json with jsonlint or something.
[13:59:54] <BillCriswell> http://jsonlint.com/
[14:00:19] <lungaro> oh my gawd that was the problem
[14:00:34] <lungaro> why is it allowed to pass key's without quotes?
[14:00:39] <lungaro> sigh
[14:01:13] <lungaro> jquery sucks, why would it blindly ignore invalid json without error
[14:01:14] <lungaro> hah
[14:03:26] <eskatrem> Hey, is there some kind of lasso in jquery? I have pages like this: http://magako.com/new-interface-symbolic-test  and I want to be able to select some elements there with a lasso. there is a lasso plugin for d3 but I can't integrate it with the page.
[14:05:11] <BillCriswell> lungaro: http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/
[14:05:21] <BillCriswell> there's an "important" note there
[14:06:34] <lungaro> I think failing silently is terrible
[14:07:17] <lungaro> noted or not =P
[14:07:44] <lungaro> i'm a frontend newb, so maybe its the norm to have to spend an hour debugging your javascript
[14:08:35] <BillCriswell> understood, writing json by hand is a pretty big no-no as well though
[18:07:43] <kegster> how can i do an on 'focusout' and prevent the trigger from happening if a particular button being clicked is the reason the focus is being out?
[18:47:19] <BillCriswell> kegster: You might be able to look at document.activeElement in the focusout?I'd have to try it and see though.
[18:49:05] <BillCriswell> Wait that won't work.
[18:52:50] <BillCriswell> Actually, it cna.
[18:54:00] <BillCriswell> Oh, left.
[18:55:35] <BillCriswell> kegster: http://jsbin.com/kasiga/1/edit?js,output
[19:12:03] <qneli> Hi
[19:24:29] <kegster> BillCriswell, interesting
[19:24:46] <kegster> im gonna try that out in just a few min
[19:25:49] <kegster> am i overthinking this when im applying this to hide an input field ? having a submit button/icon trigger the input to slide out, then focus--- and on focusout, wanting the input to slide in (unless hitting the submit button again)
[19:25:51] <qneli> Hi Im using multiple flexslider in my page.. currently my problem is how to initialize my images thumbnail min max by not refreshing my page?
[19:30:29] <kegster> BillCriswell, looks like this is the way :D
[21:43:26] <fattest> I have 3 .load() functions, for the same file, but it grabs different content of that file; is there a more efficient way of doing this instead of sending a request 3 times? http://pastebin.com/5YEDpLuC
[22:29:48] <greves> anybody know how to load jquery with a plugin in react? specifically datatables
[23:51:48] <user_corrupt> I have a modal window where I include a message like so:       $("#dialog-confirm").html(“my message.”);            and I am trying to figure out how to add html from an external file into the modal window
[23:56:30] <Cork> user_corrupt: you have to ajax fetch the resource (it should be a partial not a full html page) and then you just .html the content
