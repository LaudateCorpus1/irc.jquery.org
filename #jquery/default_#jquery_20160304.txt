[00:40:08] <acidjazz> ok
[00:40:08] <acidjazz> so
[00:40:19] <acidjazz> i need to write something that detects when an element is in the middle of the screen
[00:40:30] <acidjazz> via like a class
[00:41:55] <acidjazz> i only want tocycle through the elements in the viewport
[02:42:09] <Mark__> hello.
[02:42:17] <Mark__> could anyone tell me why this js doesn’t function? https://jsfiddle.net/do640bya/
[02:42:30] <Mark__> i changed the getelemenetbtID to getelementsbyclassname
[02:42:35] <Mark__> but then it won’t function.
[03:08:50] <slax0r> Mark__: you do realise that getElementsByClassName returns an collection of all elements that match, and getElementByID returns only that one element that has that ID?
[03:09:08] <Mark__> yes, i just found that out.
[03:09:15] <Mark__> seems like slightest modification is necessary.
[03:09:48] <slax0r> of course
[03:10:05] <Mark__> im just asking this question on SO
[03:50:51] <sharpy35> hey guys, i have 2 conntected lists with jquery sortable. everything works fine if both lists are prefilled. but on default state the first list is empy. I cannot drop an item on that empty list. the list has a minheight plus it has dropOnEmpty: true defined
[03:52:17] <sharpy35> i cannot drop from the service-list in the homepage-list
[03:52:17] <sharpy35> https://gist.github.com/anonymous/29604f80d5228d6c105c
[03:53:08] <sharpy35> do you see the prob?
[03:56:39] <acidjazz> gonan guess somehwere around having hte ajax call w/in the sortable()
[03:56:46] <acidjazz> does that pull iln teh data
[03:58:06] <slax0r> wat?
[03:58:15] <slax0r> dyslexic much?
[05:47:52] <sebbel> What's the best method to debug click handlers? I feel like I have a rogue handler, which i cannot turn off. how can I pin it down?
[06:15:19] <testing123> Hi, I am loosing my jquery responsive nature on mobile devices.I can see them being responsive when I shorten my browser while on desktop
[06:19:06] <testing123> is this a common issue ?
[06:23:07] <Xatenev> sebbel: all click handlers are listed in your dev tools.
[06:23:24] <Xatenev> sebbel: just select the element,click events and check the "Click" Tab
[06:27:38] <Mark__> could anyone help me figure out how to transform javascript’s getelementbyID to jquery selector? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35791013/getelementsbyclassname-requires-more?noredirect=1#comment59252457_35791013
[06:29:01] <testing123> anyone?
[06:29:45] <Mark__> i think that’s more of a #web question.
[06:31:38] <sebbel> Xatenev: Thanks, that worked! :)
[06:32:54] <testing123> Mark__ is it common
[06:33:07] <testing123> do we have some special settings for that ?
[06:33:27] <Mark__> have you already tried viewport?
[06:35:17] <Xatenev> Mark__: ?? document.getElementById('test') => $('#test')
[06:35:32] <Mark__> ……..
[06:35:33] <Xatenev> Mark__: I dont wanna read all your SO question right now so im just referring to what you wrote in thi schannel
[06:35:37] <Xatenev> this channel*
[06:35:39] <Mark__> okay
[06:39:57] <Mark__> just so you know,
[06:40:06] <Mark__> it didn’t work in the way you described it
[06:40:09] <Mark__> Xatenev.
[06:40:33] <Mark__> var playbackButton=jQuery(“playback-button")
[06:40:37] <Mark__> doesn’t work. :p
[06:41:37] <Mark__> i mean var playbackButton=jQuery(“#playback-button")
[07:06:23] <Xatenev> Mark__: check your left quote
[07:06:26] <Xatenev> Mark__: wtf is that
[07:06:32] <Xatenev> ““““
[07:06:32] <Mark__> what about it?
[07:06:38] <Xatenev> “ "
[07:06:46] <Mark__> i changed it to ‘ ‘
[07:06:55] <Xatenev> use ' or "
[07:06:59] <Xatenev> all other quotes wont work lol
[07:07:08] <Mark__> what do you mean?!
[07:07:17] <Mark__> i changed it to be jquery(‘ class ‘)
[07:07:33] <Mark__> but still no functioning. oh well
[07:07:42] <Xatenev> zzzz, use working quotes like: $('#id') or $('.class')
[07:07:52] <Mark__> that’s exaclty what i did but sec
[07:08:01] <Mark__> imma test it using doc ready
[07:09:04] <Xatenev> Can you show all your code in pastie somewhere?
[07:09:14] <Mark__> sec.
[07:09:42] <Mark__> https://jsfiddle.net/do640bya/2/
[07:09:46] <Mark__> still not functioning.
[07:10:15] <Mark__> and here is the original script : https://jsfiddle.net/do640bya/
[07:10:46] <Xatenev> what line?..
[07:11:20] <Mark__> what do you mean by what line?
[07:11:27] <Mark__> sec
[07:11:33] <Xatenev> Mark__: nvm i got it - are you sure its a class and no id?
[07:11:47] <Mark__> i changed them all to classes. so
[07:12:08] <Xatenev> check your source code if the element rly has a class called playback-button
[07:12:36] <Mark__> i double checked.
[07:12:40] <Mark__> if you want the complete html
[07:12:43] <Mark__> here is the live site :
[07:12:49] <Mark__> http://lifeto.cafe24.com/xe/home
[07:13:07] <Mark__> as soon as i switched from the javascript to jquery, it doesn’t work.
[07:13:08] <Mark__> hmm
[07:13:21] <Xatenev> That line works when i type it into the console.
[07:13:41] <Mark__> what would be theproblem then?any idea?
[07:15:11] <Mark__> someone on the stockoverflow says otherwise.
[09:15:45] <TECFALL> Why won't my else statement fire on line 18? http://pastebin.com/5785R9QH
[09:29:52] <C0nundrum> ascr/join #javascript
[09:31:27] <decx> did you actually check tabheight?
[09:33:43] <Xatenev> decx: Hes out.
[09:34:16] <decx> the joy of hiding joins and parts
[09:57:15] <DarsVaeda> can I initialize the datepicker date from the alternative field?
[10:58:25] <albedoa> if you use .css('position': 'absolute') to switch the position of two elements, is there an easy way of changing them back to position: static while retaining their new order? say, for two list items
[11:00:00] <decx> there is no order with absolute
[11:00:09] <decx> you detach a container from the document flow with it
[11:01:29] <shoky> you could reorder them, sorted by their x or y coordinate ;s
[11:01:36] <shoky> if that's what you're looking for
[11:01:41] <albedoa> yeah thanks, that is my plan
[11:02:35] <albedoa> would i animate them first, then attach them in their new order to the parent div?
[11:02:57] <shoky> you didnt mention anything about animation..
[11:03:11] <albedoa> oh right!
[11:03:30] <shoky> but if you want animation of the translation you can use css transitions
[11:03:47] <albedoa> thanks shoky
[11:05:17] <shoky> re-ordering could be e.g.  var sortedItems = $('.item').get().sort(function(a,b) { return $(a).position().left - $(b).position().left });  $(sortedItems).appendTo('#container');
[11:05:24] <albedoa> that worked, thanks!!
[11:28:00] * William|i7 loves writing jquery plugins
[11:50:07] <multi_io> does this look to you guys like a valid datatables table header? <table class="table table-bordered table-striped data-table table-hover" data-source="/jobs/list">
[11:50:21] <multi_io> you know, the data-source attribute
[11:50:32] <multi_io> I can't find that referenced in the docs
[11:51:43] <multi_io> my problem is, it sends that /jobs/list request to fetch the table contents, but it adds half a dozen query parameters (mainly having to do with pagination and ordering), and I can't figure out where they come from.
[11:52:30] <William|i7> datatables adds them
[11:52:38] <robertmaxrees> https://datatables.net/examples/advanced_init/html5-data-options.html
[11:53:00] <robertmaxrees> so you can specify the source using data attributes it looks like.
[11:55:46] <multi_io> hm, ok thanks guys
[11:56:23] <multi_io> but there are no  data- attributes there except data-source..?
[11:56:40] <robertmaxrees> so that's the only one that example happens to use.
[12:00:41] <multi_io> it's not an example, it's actual running code here, and it sends out that GET for /jobs/list with half a dozen additional query parameters
[12:00:50] <robertmaxrees> right.
[12:01:02] <robertmaxrees> by "example" i mean "the piece of code you provided"
[12:01:06] <multi_io> ok
[12:01:12] <robertmaxrees> if you look at the page of documentation i linked, it's pretty clear.
[12:04:54] <multi_io> hm
[12:06:03] <multi_io> I have this in the HTML source: <table class="table table-bordered table-striped data-table table-hover" data-source="/jobs/list">
[12:06:45] <multi_io> I have this in the DOM at runtime, after the table has been filled: <table class="table table-bordered table-striped data-table table-hover dataTable no-footer" data-source="/jobs/list" width="100%" id="DataTables_Table_0" role="grid" aria-describedby="DataTables_Table_0_info" style="width: 100%;">
[12:07:10] <multi_io> and this is the request that gets sent at runtime: /jobs/list?draw=1&order=id&start=0&length=100&search=&num_records=100&direction=asc&page=1&_=1457111014634
[12:07:47] <multi_io> where do the docs say where those query parameters come from?
[12:10:12] <robertmaxrees> no idea.
[12:10:21] <robertmaxrees> i might hit up their forums and ask there.
[12:11:27] <multi_io> robertmaxrees: OK, thanks
[12:14:28] * multi_io suspects it's 3rd party/other code
[12:16:46] <William|i7> mulch
[12:16:47] <William|i7> erm
[12:16:50] <William|i7> multi_io https://datatables.net/manual/server-side
[12:17:29] <William|i7> the request params are defined in the javascript
[12:17:59] <William|i7> then url you define is just the base, the params are added then your backend determins - based on the params - what to send to datatables
[12:18:52] * William|i7 actually writing his own alternative to datatables since its 'to much' for him
[12:19:05] <robertmaxrees> heh
[12:19:54] <taplar> i'm sure there are other table plugins out there
[12:20:05] <decx> i did too, it was really short, td.get.sort.appendto.table ^^
[12:20:30] <William|i7> ya plenty of table plugins
[12:20:45] <William|i7> datatables has served quite well over the years
[12:22:16] <William|i7> ive managed to do the same features (simple crud) in about 40kb tho so..
[12:23:45] <William|i7> oh more like 10kb
[12:23:53] <William|i7> (gzipped lol)
[12:46:15] <ngharo> (offtopic) does anyone know what softare people are using to create simple terminal screencasts often shown on github projects?
[12:46:35] <robertmaxrees> have an example?
[12:46:47] <ngharo> sure, like here: https://github.com/goadapp/goad
[12:46:49] <ngharo> the gif
[12:47:12] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/icholy/ttygif
[12:47:23] <ngharo> thanks!
[12:56:10] <claytonzaugg> is it possible to tell if the incoming traffic is from HTTP or HTTPS?
[12:56:22] <robertmaxrees> from a server orrr...?
[12:58:30] <claytonzaugg> We're trying to find parse our direct vs referral sources.  Because https strips referrer data, referrer comes over as direct.  However, if we were to determine if the referrer was empty && the source was HTTPS, that means the source was most likely a referral, not a direct entry source
[12:59:17] <robertmaxrees> errr.
[13:00:13] <claytonzaugg> client side, sorry
[13:00:30] <robertmaxrees> so you CAN get referer data if your site is also https
[13:00:40] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, that information is stripped iirc.
[13:01:24] <claytonzaugg> correct, I was just wondering if at least the referring protocol was kept somewhere.  The actual URL may be scrubbed, but I was hoping somewhere there might be the protocol that sent it, HTTP or HTTPS
[13:01:34] <claytonzaugg> wishful hoping it sounds like
[13:01:43] <robertmaxrees> yeah, afaik doesn't work that way.
[13:01:51] <claytonzaugg> dang
[13:03:14] <claytonzaugg> Thanks for your feedback
[15:14:42] <toothe> I'm having trouble with a paste. My jQuery isn't doing what I'm expecting: https://jsfiddle.net/r8dvkk77/
[15:14:56] <toothe> I was expecting the HTML within the <div id=copyme> to copy over. But its not.
[15:15:48] <taplar> your trying to append a cloned element that has an id
[15:16:09] <toothe> I don't understand?
[15:16:14] <taplar> ids must be unique
[15:16:19] <toothe> oh wait...
[15:16:29] * toothe checks.
[15:16:39] <Uhkis> toothe: you also dont have #pastehere there at all
[15:16:53] <toothe> eek! i didn' include it in this paste.
[15:17:23] <toothe> Updated,b ut I don't understand taplar's suggestion: https://jsfiddle.net/r8dvkk77/1/
[15:17:48] <taplar> i put the target there and it duplicated it
[15:18:05] <taplar> however, like i said, your cloning an element that has an id and putting it on the page again
[15:18:16] <taplar> ids must be unique on the page, or else it's invalid markup
[15:19:10] <Uhkis> toothe: https://jsfiddle.net/Uhkis/r8dvkk77/2/
[15:19:11] <toothe> so, I did this: template.attr('id', 'test'); to change the ID of the pasted element.
[15:19:35] <taplar> cool.  or else you could change it to be a class and forged-aboud-id!!!
[15:19:53] <toothe> hm..I just did that...
[15:20:07] <Uhkis> toothe: your biggest problem probably was you didn't have jquery in the fiddle at all
[15:20:10] <toothe> what did you do that I didn't do...
[15:20:39] <Uhkis> and that missing pastehere of course
[15:22:02] <toothe> yes, but I added that in...
[15:22:04] * toothe examines.
[15:22:36] <toothe> the only difference I see is that you put the div id in quotes.
[15:22:49] <toothe> https://jsfiddle.net/r8dvkk77/3/
[15:22:52] <toothe> that's my version.
[15:23:13] <taplar> you don't have jquery included like Uhkis said
[15:23:14] <toothe> I'm confused.
[15:23:15] <Uhkis> still no jquery in there
[15:23:18] <toothe> im sorry!
[15:23:41] <toothe> but neither did you...and yet it appeared to work for you.
[15:23:42] <taplar> pop open your console ;)
[15:24:02] <taplar> we did by clicking the javascript cog in the top right of the window
[15:24:04] <Uhkis> yes, i did :p
[15:24:12] <toothe> where? I don't see it.
[15:24:14] <taplar> you can chose various jsfiddle provided includes from there
[15:24:27] <taplar> top right corner of the javascript textbox
[15:24:36] <taplar> says "Javascript <cog icon>"
[15:24:41] <toothe> ...oh...
[15:25:11] <toothe> well, now it works.
[15:25:31] <toothe> but my actual dev code has jQuery
[15:25:51] <taplar> so it should work there too
[15:25:57] * toothe examines.
[15:26:03] <toothe> Obviously I'm doing something wrong, I just need to identify what.
[15:26:11] <toothe> whoever created jsfiddle.net shoudl be praised.
[15:26:20] <Uhkis> jquery included after your code perhaps?
[15:26:24] <taplar> on your dev page, if you type $ into the console, what do you see?
[15:26:32] <toothe> so, it'll only copy over the text
[15:27:18] <toothe> give me a moment, let me see if I can figure this out without asking :(
[15:27:21] <taplar> and make sure to check your ocnsole
[15:27:25] <taplar> *console
[15:27:26] <Uhkis> continuing on what taplar said, you're duplicating more than one id there
[15:27:36] <toothe> Uhkis: correct. I will make that change as well.
[15:27:58] <toothe> i grew up with HTML 1.0, I barely know jQuery!
[15:28:14] <taplar> it's fine.  learning is growing
[15:28:19] <toothe> :)
[15:28:22] <Uhkis> me too, but i didn't stay there ;) :D
[15:28:39] <toothe> well, i switched to C. I never really got into web development.
[15:29:05] <taplar> i did web before C++.  got into html when webtv's were a thing
[15:29:19] <toothe> what's webtv ?
[15:29:29] <taplar> it's what msntv was, if that still exists
[15:29:47] <Uhkis> what's msntv? :D
[15:30:06] <taplar> pretty much a box that was just enough to do web browsing and used your tv as a monitor
[15:30:17] <toothe> oh, like a chromebook?
[15:30:28] <toothe> i freaking lvoe Chromebooks
[15:30:28] <taplar> it was nice in that you really couldn't get viruses on it, and it had an awesome email client
[15:31:08] <taplar> peeps with webtv's would make crazy long signatures in for their emails that were pretty much webpages with gifs and music, and marquees all over the place
[15:31:33] <Uhkis> sounds like 90s
[15:31:36] <taplar> :)
[15:31:53] <taplar> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_TV
[15:33:06] <toothe> the only thing I can think fo why this isn't working is that I have a <div> tag within a <table>...
[15:34:13] <Uhkis> toothe: can you show the actual code?
[15:34:29] <toothe> sure, I was trying to figure out the best way to share this in a jfiddle.
[15:34:58] <Uhkis> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSN_TV#WebTV_briefly_classified_as_a_weapon lol
[15:35:06] <toothe> https://dpaste.de/F3QS
[15:35:17] <toothe> you'll see that there is <div id="copyme">AAA
[15:35:34] <toothe> I am getting template.attrs is not a function in the console.
[15:36:25] <toothe> so, its clearly not even finding the copyme div tag.
[15:38:55] <z1haze> anyone know how to get raw data analytics for your website so it can be used in other chart libraries?
[15:39:08] <toothe> maybe the version of jquery I'm using is too old?
[15:39:09] <toothe> its 1.11
[15:39:12] <Uhkis> toothe: you have a typo there
[15:39:17] <toothe> ...?
[15:39:26] <Uhkis> toothe: #21
[15:39:30] <Uhkis> "attrs"
[15:40:20] <toothe> silly me
[15:40:28] <toothe> but even then, it only copies over the 3 A's
[15:40:31] <toothe> AAA, nothing more.
[15:41:19] <toothe> so, the paste comes out as <div id="abc">AAA</div>
[15:41:20] <toothe> nothing else.
[15:41:52] <Uhkis> toothe: that's caused by your invalid html
[15:42:14] <toothe> oh? where specifically?
[15:42:31] <toothe> i suspect its that I cannot have a <div> within a <table>
[15:42:32] <Uhkis> toothe: you need to open that div before that table
[15:42:38] <toothe> I see...
[15:43:19] <Uhkis> and end before the closing div too
[15:43:28] <toothe> that is it. I am using a tbody and it works.
[15:43:56] <Uhkis> good old http://validator.w3.org/ is a fine tool
[15:44:08] <toothe> yes! so the only issue is, I wish there was a local validator.
[15:44:21] <toothe> there are Chrome addons, but they basically just link to w3.org
[15:44:33] <Uhkis> there is
[15:44:49] <Uhkis> use the file upload or direct input
[15:45:33] <Uhkis> web developer addon for firefox has a button for validating current page nicely
[15:46:02] <Uhkis> heh, your html broke the validator :D
[15:46:07] <toothe> yes, there are several problems.
[15:46:28] <toothe> i might just bring someone to my 1-man team to do the HTML
[15:46:31] <toothe> and jQuery.
[15:50:22] <Uhkis> not a bad idea at all if you're overworked with it
[16:10:09] <hellyeah> hey there
[16:10:17] <hellyeah> how is it going?
[16:11:58] <hellyeah> using map instead of each will give me something good about performance?
[16:12:43] <taplar> depends on how you use it
[16:19:51] <hellyeah> taplar:  i supposed you quitted
[16:19:57] <hellyeah> are you here and available?
[16:19:59] <taplar> my vpn crapped out
[16:20:04] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:20:13] <taplar> did you see what i said last?
[16:20:36] <hellyeah> depends on how you use it
[16:20:42] <hellyeah> you said
[16:20:48] <taplar> yep
[16:20:54] <hellyeah> what do you mean exactly?
[16:21:04] <hellyeah> map will iterate array
[16:21:04] <taplar> each and map do different things
[16:21:11] <hellyeah> and you can return something
[16:21:20] <taplar> *should*
[16:21:24] <taplar> it's expected
[16:21:28] <hellyeah> the plus of map is to return something
[16:21:35] <hellyeah> thats the nature of map right?
[16:21:38] <taplar> yep
[16:22:31] <hellyeah> okey
[16:22:41] <hellyeah> hmm there is reduce and filter also
[16:23:04] <taplar> uhh, not the same functions iirc
[16:23:09] <hellyeah> reduce is to move object to anther object
[16:23:18] <hellyeah> i dont remember filter
[16:23:38] <taplar> filter doesn't change any of the elements
[16:23:48] <taplar> reduce does or creates a new one iirc
[16:24:01] <taplar> filter is just that, a filter
[16:24:22] <hellyeah> btwe
[16:24:24] <hellyeah> btw
[16:24:33] <hellyeah> i used delegation correctly this time
[16:24:37] <hellyeah> $('body').on('click','#new', createANewDatepickerSection); :)
[16:24:43] <taplar> cool
[16:25:19] <_Deacyde_> Anyone know why http://jsfiddle.net/pbhd2/ this works there but not if I copy and paste it into a html page?
[16:25:43] <taplar> _Deacyde_: what do you see in your console?
[16:27:16] <hellyeah> taplar:  can i show you my last effort with my design?
[16:27:23] <taplar> hellyeah: sure
[16:28:47] <hellyeah> this is Turkish i am sorry for that http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/18/ just select smt from dropdowns and radiobox create datepicker select dates "you can create multiple" and hover over colorized dates i try to use font, color etc. here http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/18/
[16:28:54] <hellyeah> sorry for double posting
[16:29:03] <_Deacyde_> Sorry I'm not using console, just really trying to use that function of clicking a button and making a keystroke happen, but that function doesn't happen when I clone it
[16:29:27] <taplar> you should always crack open your console when your developing.  especially if you have an issue
[16:29:35] <_Deacyde_> roger one sec
[16:29:58] <hellyeah> _Deacyde_:  when you cop and paste
[16:30:08] <hellyeah> sometimes there is invisible characters
[16:30:12] <hellyeah> you pasted
[16:30:29] <hellyeah> this happened to me sometimes
[16:30:48] <_Deacyde_> Very true, I'll check for that as well, as for taplar: no errors in console before and after button click
[16:31:22] <taplar> ok, if you put a console log inside the event handler do you see it execute?
[16:31:29] <taplar> hellyeah: your still doing appends inside of eaches
[16:31:52] <taplar> and your still not caching selectors
[16:32:27] <taplar> getDatesFromCurrentDatePickers is doing a binding inside of it
[16:32:42] <taplar> which is an event handler, so there is the chance of double bindings
[16:33:08] <taplar> i'll stop with that, :)
[16:33:23] <_Deacyde_> Nothing is showing in console
[16:33:36] <taplar> _Deacyde_: so that's telling me that your element is not bound to
[16:33:53] <taplar> so either the selector is wrong, or it did not exist at the time you tried to bind
[16:34:06] <taplar> or you said something about cloning?
[16:34:13] <_Deacyde_> the function was a broad button function
[16:34:18] <_Deacyde_> so any button would work
[16:35:01] <taplar> uh, i think your misunderstanding
[16:35:06] <_Deacyde_> most likely
[16:35:14] <taplar> buttons that are created after that binding runs, will not have the event bound to them
[16:35:40] <taplar> $('button') is finding all the buttons in the dom at that point in time, and putting the binding on them
[16:35:46] <taplar> if they don't exist, no dice
[16:36:12] <taplar> you'd have to either bind to the new ones created, or change it to be a delegate
[16:36:38] <_Deacyde_> Ok, making more sense now
[16:36:53] <taplar> are you familiar with delegates?
[16:37:42] <_Deacyde_> no, but I just fixed it, by placing the script in the footer so the button was 1st, ( was what I picked up from what you said )
[16:37:52] <taplar> :) that works too
[16:38:00] <_Deacyde_> I know most scripts should be there anyways, but this wasnt so I left it
[16:38:02] <taplar> or you could have thrown it in a doc ready
[16:38:04] <_Deacyde_> thinking it was important
[16:38:08] <taplar> but bottom of page is preferred
[16:38:16] <_Deacyde_> doc ready? I'm a newb to js
[16:38:39] <taplar> a document ready allows you to put logic in your page that will execute after the document is parsed into the dom
[16:38:44] <taplar> you can do it with
[16:38:46] <_Deacyde_> and self taught all the way, so I don't pick up on the proper terms for some things
[16:38:56] <taplar> $(document).ready(function(){ ..code here.. });
[16:38:57] <taplar> or
[16:39:06] <taplar> $(function(){ ...code here... });
[16:39:17] <_Deacyde_> Ahhah! that's prolly why the googlesheets wasn't liking this script
[16:39:27] <taplar> if you put your logic in one of those, regardless of where it was included in the page, it will wait until the dom is loaded
[16:39:38] <taplar> but if you put it at the bottom of the page, you don't need those
[16:39:56] <_Deacyde_> Gotcha, thank you very much
[16:40:00] <taplar> sure
[16:40:10] <taplar> btw, for reading: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[16:40:41] <_Deacyde_> Surething, thanks again!
[16:44:58] <hellyeah> taplar:  any thought about my effort?
[16:45:11] <taplar> did you see my comments I made?
[16:45:34] <taplar> i listed like 3 or so things
[16:45:58] <hellyeah> let me check above
[16:46:01] <hellyeah> sorry
[16:47:17] <hellyeah> taplar:  caching selectors i dont know how to do that part
[16:47:32] <hellyeah> but if you create multiple datepickers
[16:47:40] <hellyeah> there will be some performance problem
[16:47:49] <taplar> var $something = $('.something');
[16:47:59] <taplar> then reuse $something
[16:48:12] <taplar> any where that your repeating lookups
[16:48:44] <hellyeah> i supposed i fixed but not all of them mobviously
[16:49:12] <hellyeah> i will do smt real quick
[16:49:14] <hellyeah> just a sec
[16:50:03] <taplar> that's not a real quick thing.  you have multiple things that could be cached
[16:51:48] <hellyeah> taplar:  you mean this right http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/19/
[16:52:16] <hellyeah> hmm
[16:52:49] <taplar> uh, no
[16:53:08] <taplar> '#new' is not a lookup, that's filter for the delegate
[16:53:18] <taplar> $() is a lookup
[16:53:23] <taplar> typically
[16:56:59] <hellyeah> right
[16:58:27] <hxm> hi, is there a way to detect the keypress "cmd+alt+enter"? or ctrl without using libraries
[16:58:47] <hellyeah> there is some keyCodes
[16:59:10] <hellyeah> you can use mouseon or mouse enter and keyCodes
[16:59:39] <hellyeah> i dont know what it was cmd + alt + enter
[16:59:54] <hxm> yes, i use a switch for detect the keycodes but each keydown is a new event so there is no way to acumulate hotkeys
[16:59:55] <taplar> hellyeah: http://jsfiddle.net/eefvjubt/20/  i added comments to the top of your js section
[17:00:32] <taplar> hxm if your trying to check if other keys are held, such as ctrl or shift there are special fields for those you can check on the event
[17:00:48] <hxm> ah, thanks for the tip
[17:00:54] <taplar> i'm fixing to head out, but others can tell you more about that, or search mdn about events
[17:01:07] <taplar> hellyeah: give those notes a gander and try to fix those.
[17:01:28] <taplar> have a good weekend all
[17:01:46] <hellyeah> gender
[17:06:05] <Mark__> morning
[17:09:04] <islalobo> Looking for a lightbox where I can display the alt text as the image title. Can I do this with any lightbox?
[17:10:27] <islalobo> I think I found on the web what I need! Imagine! http://jsfiddle.net/2LXNh/
[17:22:22] <z1haze> im trying to figure out how to use the google embed api.. has anyone here used it and can help me?
[17:22:37] <z1haze> i have followed the basic tutorial to demonstrate a dashboard, but i dont get any charts to show up
[17:22:47] <robertmaxrees> any console errors or anything?
[17:23:18] <z1haze> nope
[17:23:34] <z1haze> no wait
[17:23:50] <z1haze> there is
[17:32:53] <z1haze> ok robertmaxrees now i have an error that im stuck on, fixed the others
[17:32:58] <robertmaxrees> sup
[17:33:05] <z1haze> its just a generic Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set property 'innerHTML' of null
[17:33:14] <z1haze> copied exact tutorial code though
[17:33:14] <robertmaxrees> are you using innerHTML on something?
[17:33:21] <BetaFrey> I am trying to return a value to a textbox with autocomplete and I got it working if I create just a string array but I can't figure out how to get it to work if I am returning a bunch of objects that contain the values I need to search
[17:33:27] <robertmaxrees> you realize i can't divine your code, your z1haze?
[17:33:28] <z1haze> its coming from the gapi.loaded_ file i guess from google
[17:33:34] <z1haze> its not my code
[17:33:45] <robertmaxrees> z1haze but you may be using things incorrectly.
[17:33:47] <robertmaxrees> is my point.
[17:33:49] <robertmaxrees> show me what you're doing.
[17:33:52] <z1haze> http://testlist.hendricksweb.com/admin probably
[17:33:54] <z1haze> ok 1 sec
[17:34:05] <z1haze> well its all in the source of that page
[17:34:10] <z1haze> toward the bottle i did the entire example in the body
[17:34:14] <z1haze> bottom*
[17:34:26] <robertmaxrees> i
[17:34:31] <robertmaxrees> *i'm not going to read your entire page source.
[17:34:36] <robertmaxrees> make a fiddle.
[17:34:45] <robertmaxrees> or at least bpaste the relevant bits or something.
[17:35:47] <z1haze> isnt there just some way to collect my analytics data from google
[17:35:54] <robertmaxrees> ... huh?
[17:36:01] <robertmaxrees> z1haze you said you're having problems getting something to work.
[17:36:06] <z1haze> all i want to do is get my site analytics
[17:36:08] <z1haze> yea
[17:36:15] <z1haze> well im following this elaborate example they give
[17:36:16] <robertmaxrees> what do your analytics have to do with that?
[17:36:21] <z1haze> for an entire dashboard using some chart library i dont care about
[17:36:22] <robertmaxrees> that WHO gives?
[17:36:28] <z1haze> GOOGLE
[17:36:38] <z1haze> https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/embed-api/third-party-visualizations/
[17:37:00] <robertmaxrees> those are hardly elaborate.
[17:37:10] <z1haze> its hundreds of lines
[17:37:28] <robertmaxrees> right, becuase it's all the examples for the dashboard.
[17:37:29] <z1haze> all i want is the data
[17:37:48] <robertmaxrees> then why are you looking at the third party vis api?
[17:38:16] <z1haze> well in the end ill be using my own third party visualization figured it would show how to just get the data.. thats what the link said when i clicked it
[17:38:37] <z1haze> But it also allows you to access the raw data so you can display it however you want. This example uses the Chart.js visualization library.
[17:38:49] <z1haze> taken right from the link i clicked
[17:39:05] <z1haze> for 'third party visuals'
[17:39:17] <robertmaxrees> so you're just trying to access your analytics data - that's all.
[17:39:23] <z1haze> yea thats all i want
[17:39:47] <robertmaxrees> renderWeekOverWeekChart
[17:39:52] <robertmaxrees> this function on that URL shows you the basics.
[17:40:10] <z1haze> do i need to include the stuff from above in the <script> imports
[17:40:17] <robertmaxrees> you call query(), which returns a promise.  Promise.all([thisWeek, lastWeek]).then(function(results) {
[17:40:31] <z1haze> they have this.. date-range-selector and active-users.. not sure what if i need it
[17:40:39] <robertmaxrees> that Promise.all call is then where the magic happens.
[17:41:14] <z1haze> and even still it ends up making some graph i wdont want
[17:41:17] <robertmaxrees> https://ga-dev-tools.appspot.com/embed-api/custom-components/
[17:41:41] <robertmaxrees> you can do whatever you want withing the promise.all
[17:42:02] <z1haze> so Promise.all() is a method on google api that gives everything?
[17:42:07] <robertmaxrees> that particular example happens to call new Chart(makeCanvas('chart-1-container')).Line(data); - you don't have to use iut.
[17:42:22] <robertmaxrees> no.
[17:42:48] <robertmaxrees> Promise.all() gets passed an array of promises.
[17:43:13] <robertmaxrees> then they all complete, the callbacks registered via .then() get called.
[17:43:51] <z1haze> alright
[17:44:26] <robertmaxrees> everything you need is shown in that page.
[17:44:29] <z1haze> the variabels they are sending in, thisYear, lastYear.. is there a page somewhere that shows what properties you can ask for and how to format it, etc
[17:44:42] <robertmaxrees> i would assume google could help you thgere ;)
[17:45:26] <robertmaxrees> and you care about the query function.
[17:45:41] <robertmaxrees> thisYear and lastyear are just var names.  you could use whatever you want for those.
[17:46:38] <z1haze> right, i understand that
[17:47:51] <z1haze> i dont see anything related to this query method though
[17:47:55] <shoky> z1haze:  https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/reference#q_summary
[17:48:02] <z1haze> looking at the api reference
[17:48:06] <z1haze> https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/embed/v1/core-methods-reference
[17:48:06] <z1haze> ah
[17:48:09] <Poppabear> :P
[17:48:11] <robertmaxrees> aaaand shoky tosses out a link ;)
[17:48:15] <shoky> ;p
[17:48:45] <z1haze> hmm the pages look similar just yours has a lot more stuff
[17:48:54] <robertmaxrees> lol
[17:48:57] <z1haze> haha
[17:49:54] <shoky> you're looking at embed-specific docs i think, needed to look at the core query api. i got there by clicking on "query explorer" on the first page you linked
[17:50:01] <robertmaxrees> heh
[17:50:03] <shoky> might also be a useful page for you
[17:50:04] <Poppabear> z1haze: its jquery time ? :P
[17:50:16] <z1haze> hmm?
[17:54:34] <z1haze> down to 1 error
[17:54:39] <z1haze> Uncaught ReferenceError: query is not defined
[17:54:56] <z1haze> var dataset1 = query({ ...
[17:57:00] <z1haze> http://dpaste.com/3F7QG6D why would query() be undefined?
[17:58:31] <robertmaxrees> is the embed api loading correctly?
[17:58:34] <shoky> z1haze: because you didnt define it
[17:58:35] <robertmaxrees> open your network tab and make sure.
[17:58:44] <shoky> z1haze: they define it in their example
[17:59:12] <z1haze> oh right its not part of the api
[17:59:32] <robertmaxrees> i might check out #google btw - full channel JUST for google products :)

[18:15:57] <jquery950> do you know maybe what is the catch_
