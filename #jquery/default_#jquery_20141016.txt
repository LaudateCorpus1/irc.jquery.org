[00:00:05] <Cork> i want to hit the one thinking up this silly format though
[00:00:34] <larsemil> www.dt.se Cork be my guest
[00:00:55] <k_sze> Why can offset() return floating point numbers for top and left?
[00:01:19] <doug_> k_sze: why not?
[00:02:13] <Cork> Dala tidningarna...
[00:02:15] <Cork> jaja
[00:02:25] <larsemil> :)
[00:02:37] <k_sze> It's giving me a hard time when I want to use it to calculate the integer position of the mouse cursor inside an element.
[00:03:10] <Cork> k_sze: cause position is a floating value
[00:03:19] <Cork> it isn't an int
[00:03:40] <Cork> you can literally set something to be 0.5px
[00:04:15] <doug_> k_sze: use Math.floor to round toward zero, assuming that helps. round away from zero with Math.ceil
[00:04:37] <Cork> or Math.round if you want closest
[00:07:27] <doug_> .quantum-mechanic { left: 2.2e-308px; }
[00:08:10] <k_sze> lol
[00:08:27] <k_sze> well, px wouldn't be make much sense
[00:08:32] <k_sze> because you don't know the dpi
[00:08:39] <Cork> doug_: jquery ui actually had one of those for a while
[00:09:05] <Cork> was text-indent not left
[00:09:09] <Cork> and it was negative
[00:09:10] <Cork> but ya :)
[00:12:23] <ThKo> Hi, does anyone see the error in this fiddle http://jsfiddle.net/3f7v7xtd/ ? He never fires the first tx.executeSql ? I don’t see an error?! Thank you …
[00:17:29] <k_sze> And it seems that jQuery.ui.tooltip works globally somehow?
[00:18:01] <k_sze> Is there a way to trigger the display of a tooltip only through an event (e.g. mousemove event over an image)?
[00:18:43] <k_sze> without affecting whatever tooltip behaviour is already defined globally.
[00:19:13] <doug_> ThKo: var!
[00:19:47] <ThKo> Ohhhh I see.. myid instead of myId
[00:19:51] <ThKo> doug_: Thanks a lot!
[00:21:45] <Macaveli> Anyone have experience with Cycle 2? I have found the pause and resume buttons but is their a default way of showing them in the slider?
[00:23:59] <doug_> k_sze: well sure, but even on a 1 billion km monitor, it would still be a subatomic distance :D
[00:25:08] <prohobo> jquery suuuuuuuucks, but i loooove it
[00:25:14] <prohobo> uuuu
[00:25:18] <no_gravity> is it possible to define a style in javascript? say, change all links to color:red? without iterating through them?
[00:25:34] <doug_> no_gravity: append a style tag to the page
[00:25:49] <no_gravity> doug_: how?
[00:26:04] <doug_> no_gravity: $('body').append($('<style/>).text(myCss))
[00:26:15] <no_gravity> doug_: hmm.. yeah... i think i have a better idea
[00:26:25] <MaxSlot> Can someone help? http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26385756/mousewheel-opera-chrome-ff-works-fine-but-ie-didint-hover-scrolling
[00:26:50] <no_gravity> doug_: adding a classname to the body. say "getRed". and then define ".getRed a { color: red }"
[00:26:52] <Cork> no_gravity: set a class on body that applies the color change
[00:26:57] <no_gravity> Cork: yeah
[00:27:09] <Cork> that is the best solution
[00:27:25] <Cork> cause then the style is where it should be
[00:27:36] <no_gravity> yeah
[00:38:05] <ThKo> Is there a way to run $( 'input[type="checkbox"]' ).each( function () { } this loop with executeSql in it synchronous? :-)
[00:41:27] <doug_> ThKo: why would you do that
[00:42:14] <tiblock> Hi. I have <a href> with .click event. What is correct way to stop link working, return false or event.preventDefault?
[00:42:21] <doug_> you don't want it to be suck-ronous
[00:42:35] <ThKo> Moment, my fiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/8afo7mL9/ My problem is that the program inserts all records with the last „myId“ .
[00:45:43] <doug_> ThKo: I see massive security holes in that code
[00:46:30] <doug_> "INSERT INTO responses ( response_id , question_id ) VALUES ( " + myId + " , "....  <- very bad
[00:46:37] <ThKo> doug_: Yes, I’ve  to use parseInt() etc.
[00:47:58] <doug_> ThKo: what happens if myId = "1' or 1 or '"
[00:48:35] <doug_> ThKo: it deletes every response
[00:48:46] <ThKo> Ok I understand.
[00:49:12] <Erwat> hey is it possible to draw gradient text without the use of canvas?
[00:49:44] <doug_> ThKo: ah, that's a classic problem with closures. should be easy to fix
[00:51:21] <doug_> ThKo: it's an each, how can that be?
[00:51:42] <ThKo> doug_: You mean my loop?
[00:52:04] <doug_> ThKo: are you sure those checkboxes have different ids?
[00:52:24] <ThKo> Yep, sure. My old code works fine. Fiddle follows, moment
[00:53:20] <ThKo> http://jsfiddle.net/7u6n5mo4/ this works fine.
[00:53:29] <k_sze> I'm trying to open a jQuery UI tooltip programmatically, using $(selector).tooltip('open');
[00:53:34] <ThKo> But before inserting a response I’ve to check if the response exists.
[00:53:38] <k_sze> However, I get TypeError: undefined is not a function.
[00:53:40] <k_sze> What am I missing?
[00:54:15] <k_sze> jQuery UI is version 1.10.3, jQuery is 2.0.3
[00:54:33] <k_sze> For the record, $(selector).tooltip itself *is* a function.
[00:54:46] <k_sze> It's only when I call $(selector).tooltip('open') that I get the TypeError.
[00:55:15] <Cork> Erwat: its possible in webkit, but not cross browsers as far as i know
[00:55:35] <Erwat> Cork: yup, i found that answer too and i'm sad about it
[00:55:36] <Cork> (there isn't a standard property for -webkit-text-fill-color as far as i know)
[00:55:44] <Erwat> SVG seems like an option but i don't know if it's an improvement over canvas :<
[00:56:18] <Cork> Erwat: i have an itchy feeling at the back of my head that i've seen something planed
[00:56:19] <ThKo> doug_: I seems that the each loop runs faster than the tx.executeSql
[00:56:26] <Cork> with either mask or something else
[00:56:28] <Cork> but can't remember it
[00:56:41] <doug_> ThKo: of course it does but that's ok because of closures
[00:57:28] <doug_> ThKo: each function expression will bind to the variables that are in scope there
[00:59:10] <doug_> ThKo: I see the bug
[00:59:11] <ThKo> doug_: So the error must be somewhere else
[00:59:17] <ThKo> Yes? :)
[00:59:55] <doug_> ThKo: http://jsfiddle.net/8afo7mL9/1/   moved the var myId
[01:00:22] <doug_> ThKo: each invocation of the .each callback needs its own value for that variable
[01:00:34] <doug_> putting it outside makes them all share the same one
[01:01:32] <doug_> ThKo: what are line 4-6 doing? are they globals? shouldn't they be var too?
[01:02:40] <ThKo> doug_: Ah I understand. cb cbId responsequery are global. cbId and cb are deprecated.
[01:03:03] <ThKo> I’ll try it. One moment :)
[01:07:10] <doug_> I wish there were an irc channel for V8
[01:08:04] <Kartagis> what's V8? Java v8?
[01:08:22] <doug_> Kartagis: v8 is the open source javascript engine they use in chrome
[01:08:25] <doug_> and node
[01:08:39] <doug_> it has a very nicely designed API
[01:10:05] <Erwat> Cork: SVG actually seems like a really good option
[01:10:32] <Erwat> it worked on all the devices in allt he browsers i tried
[01:10:51] <Erwat> and it enabled the holy grail of gradient text: gradient based on an image
[01:11:53] <doug_> isn't it funny how dead irc rooms where nobody talks are FULL of join/leave messages? lol
[01:12:36] <doug_> #chromium has 500+ users and nobody has said a word for over 4 hours
[01:12:37] <Kartagis> doug_: and does it support all core javascript stuff?
[01:13:03] <doug_> Kartagis: yes it IS the javascript engine of chrome, so of course it supports everything chrome supports
[01:13:08] <ThKo> doug_: Thank you very very very much. Now it works great :) Thanks a lot!! :-)
[01:13:17] <doug_> ThKo: np
[01:14:12] <doug_> Kartagis: about 14 microseconds per callback on my laptop (very simple callback that captures a variable in closure and returns it incremented
[01:14:45] <Kartagis> doug_: compared to?
[01:15:14] <doug_> Kartagis: compared to nothing but that is pretty minimal overhead considering
[01:15:41] <doug_> 71 callbacks per millisecond
[01:16:41] <doug_> I was expecting brutal call overhead but it flies
[01:50:20] <Macaveli> https://www.evernote.com/shard/s389/sh/00470ea5-568b-43a0-b786-5bf6f330ca34/24baeda682a4d5ff4dc3ce374a2b77d8 any idea why these click event listeners exist for plain "p tags"?
[01:50:25] <Macaveli> and how do I remove the m
[02:03:02] <delboy1978uk> if i have several checkboxes[] in a form how do i get all the checked ones for $.post()ing?
[02:07:23] <delboy1978uk> its cool i found it http://stackoverflow.com/questions/908708/how-to-pass-multiple-checkboxes-using-jquery-ajax-post
[02:46:37] <doug_> Macaveli: those are on the document node aren
[02:46:40] <doug_> t they?
[02:46:54] <Macaveli> doug_  I don't understat what you mean
[02:47:13] <doug_> Macaveli: those handlers appear to be on every element right?
[02:47:59] <Macaveli> they do indeed
[02:48:12] <doug_> Macaveli: those are the handlers on the document node
[02:48:43] <doug_> as in $(document).on('click', 'selector', function() ...
[02:49:52] <doug_> the debugger shows them because, if someone clicks that 'p' element (for example) the click event will end up getting processed by those handlers
[02:50:58] <doug_> Macaveli: http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/
[02:53:01] <doug_> Macaveli: in other words, those event handlers aren't *really* on every element, but events can reach those handlers on document from any node
[02:53:33] <Macaveli> so they are not removable
[02:53:58] <doug_> Macaveli: do you have a reason to remove them?
[02:54:10] <doug_> they are probably there from plugins and stuff
[02:55:38] <doug_> Macaveli: to remove them, disable any plugins you are using. they should disappear
[02:58:54] <Macaveli> Alright thank you!
[02:59:07] <doug_> np
[02:59:37] <Macaveli> I'll inform my team about this

[03:59:00] <Omar-> MaxSlot http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/aukyz8ap/26/

[04:01:06] <MaxSlot> ty
[04:02:37] <MaxSlot> only need fix little bug
[04:02:42] <MaxSlot> will try
[04:03:36] <maxi_> hi i have a fairly simple question. i want to attach a event handler that works like the old live that can trigger on dynamically created elements.. so i use the $("click obj").on("click", "PARENT", function()) syntax
[04:04:10] <maxi_> but it doesnt trigger and i think its because the "parent" is several levels above not just one level
[04:04:20] <maxi_> how do i solve this?
[04:08:27] <maxi_> ohps it was the other way around i solved it :P
[04:12:22] <Omar-> MaxSlot ok
[04:22:06] <dopie> http://jsfiddle.net/jzg4qoub/7/  how can i get the first name and last name to appear in .fullname
[04:23:16] <Cork> dopie: whats .fullname?
[04:23:38] <dopie> its a paragraph inside the statement
[04:23:54] <dopie> so i want fName + lName
[04:24:35] <Cork> ah there it is
[04:24:49] <Cork> dopie: you want a separate element inside the p
[04:24:52] <Cork> to hold the value
[04:25:01] <dopie> yeha
[04:26:25] <Cork> then you just do $('#user_firstname, #userlastname').on('input', function() { $('#user_fullname').html($.map($('#user_firstname, #userlastname'), function(elm) { return $(elm).val(); }).join(' '));  })
[04:27:05] <Cork> or ya you could use fName + ' ' + lName if you want to modify it before adding it
[04:30:19] <dopie> Cork can you fiddle it?

[04:34:25] <ragam> hi
[04:34:38] <ragam> where can i find good tutorials for jquery?
[04:34:50] <dopie> ragam, there is this book
[04:35:03] <Cork> ragam: http://try.jquery.com/ for one
[04:35:07] <Uhkis> http://try.jquery.com for learning basics
[04:35:08] <dopie> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1118531647/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d18_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=144F49X3YNAP7AR1C9W5&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=1688200382&pf_rd_i=507846

[05:29:30] <ThKo> Hi guys, maybe a stupid question: Is this the right way to execute more executeSql? http://jsfiddle.net/p80Lsea4/ Thanks for your hints! :-)
[05:31:21] <ThKo> Or will I get some troubles with variable tx and results?
[05:32:54] <shadej>  I want to do it like this: inputfield.addClass("error","duration must be greater than 2 days") and jquery must prevent submitting the form like it does when a required field is not filled out. how can I do it?
[05:33:27] <Cork> shadej: addClass??
[05:33:51] <Cork> you would have the class is one thing
[05:34:00] <Cork> you would have to block the .submit yourself
[05:34:12] <Cork> and the message you need to put where you want to show it
[05:34:38] <shadej> Cork: I thought there is a plugin fo rthat?
[05:34:55] <Cork> shadej: jquery.validator
[05:35:03] <Cork> but that doesn't use addClass
[05:35:25] <shadej> I am not sure about the addClass just tell me how it does show messages.
[05:35:39] <Cork> you would have to use the plugin
[05:35:45] <Cork> or do what i said before
[05:35:56] <Cork> there isn't any "do this things" you have to actually do them
[05:40:14] <decx> technically addClass() could be used to show text. -> .error:after { content: attr(data-error) } ^^
[05:40:53] <Cork> decx: but the text wouldn't be in the addClass call
[05:41:06] <Cork> it would be in the css file...
[05:41:09] <decx> yeah wasnt that serious ;)
[05:41:23] <Cork> i know
[05:41:32] <Cork> or rather got that
[05:41:38] <shadej> Cork: yeah, I was looking over http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2457032/jquery-validation-change-default-error-message but none of them show how to add custom message?
[05:41:39] <decx> jq validator is good shadej use that
[05:42:42] <decx> validate() has a message object use that
[05:43:06] <decx> it's right there in that stack link
[05:44:20] <shadej> sorry not custom message I want custom rule.
[05:44:42] <shadej> but I think this will work for me. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/241145/jquery-validate-plugin-how-to-create-a-simple-custom-rule
[05:45:35] <decx> ye addMethod worked fine for me last time i used it
[05:45:49] <decx> pretty straight forward
[05:46:04] <shadej> great I will try it

[06:04:29] <DieHardMan> How can i select an element without any attributes, something like $('div:not([*])')
[06:04:58] <decx> that's a ridiculous premise
[06:05:04] <Cork> DieHardMan: no
[06:05:16] <Cork> DieHardMan: it would be really slow for the browser to do that
[06:05:24] <Cork> so css doesn't support it
[06:05:36] <Cork> just like it doesn't support parent selectors
[06:05:57] <DieHardMan> hmm ok
[06:06:03] <decx> the question is, why do you think you need that
[06:06:15] <decx> there's probably a sane solution to your problem
[06:06:38] <Mark___> can anyone give me a hand on applying this js on my webpage?

[06:10:34] <Cork> frank_o: var only = $('p').clone().find('*').remove(); only.text()
[06:10:51] <Cork> frank_o: basically, dom doesn't support that
[06:11:12] <frank_o> Cork: Nice - thanks buddy
[06:11:14] <frank_o> Tricky one tough !
[06:11:18] <frank_o> * though
[06:11:22] <decx> well you can check if the first contents() is a textNode grab that
[06:11:24] <Cork> frank_o: it's not nice
[06:11:26] <Cork> its a dirty hack
[06:11:46] <frank_o> yeah =/ that it is
[06:14:54] <frank_o> decx: http://stackoverflow.com/a/298758 ?
[06:15:16] <decx> something like that
[06:15:49] <Cork> frank_o: also why do you need this?
[06:16:04] <Cork> often there are structural solutions that solves this better
[06:16:24] <tiblock> Hi. I have 10 elements with id el1 el2 el3 ... el10 and class "el". If i do $('#el4') how to get next el?
[06:16:42] <Cork> tiblock: give them a class
[06:16:46] <Cork> and select based on that
[06:17:03] <tiblock> Cork, they all have classes "el" but how to select next?
[06:17:18] <decx> .next()
[06:17:34] <Cork> var el = $('.el'); el.eq(el.index(current) + 1)
[06:17:46] <Cork> .next only works if they are direct siblings
[06:18:20] <tiblock> Cork, .index is what i need, thank yo
[06:18:20] <decx> for all we know they might be ^^
[06:18:22] <tiblock> you

[06:18:43] <Cork> ah
[06:19:10] <decx> that's terrible frank_o
[06:19:35] <frank_o> decx: Yeah feels like im cleaning toilets =/
[06:19:51] <Cork> frank_o: don't forget the rubber gloves
[06:20:06] <frank_o> :)
[06:20:57] <Cork> heh reminds me of an old monolog comment from here
[06:21:03] <Cork> can't translate it through
[06:21:45] <frank_o> why not?
[06:22:21] <frank_o> By the way shouldn't http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/bracpfdL/1/ work? `if($(this).contents().filter(function() { return this.nodeType === 3; }))`
[06:23:05] <Cork> frank_o: cause it becomes kinda hard to keep the joke after translating it
[06:23:25] <Cork> frank_o: no, cause dom doens't expose text nodes
[06:23:33] <Cork> you would have to loop nodes to find them
[06:24:03] <frank_o> gotcha.. much obliged..
[06:24:15] <Cork> frank_o: so basically this.childNodes
[06:24:17] <Cork> and loop that
[06:24:48] <MarcGuay> Is the best plugin for custom scrollbars still jscrollpane?
[06:25:08] <MarcGuay> Subjective responses will be prioritized.
[06:25:16] <Cork> MarcGuay: as far as i've seen there isn't a single not broken scrollbar replacement
[06:25:39] <Cork> so my point is, you should never ever EVER replace them
[06:25:47] <Cork> (ever)
[06:25:48] <MarcGuay> Cork: Broken in terms of functionality or implementation?
[06:25:59] <frank_o> Cork: i think ill go for your initial solution: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/bracpfdL/2/
[06:26:09] <Cork> MarcGuay: both
[06:26:15] <Cork> they always break somethign
[06:26:18] <Cork> *thing
[06:26:20] <Mark___> http://jsfiddle.net/lifeto/trbuzhh6/4/ this ain’t working
[06:26:41] <Mark___> anybody who has 2 hands can i have your hand?
[06:26:43] <Cork> MarcGuay: either they break a "not primary platform"
[06:26:48] <Cork> or they break scrollTop
[06:26:53] <Cork> or they break touch
[06:27:02] <Cork> or a system that handle touch differently
[06:27:04] <Cork> or...
[06:27:22] <Cork> i've seen so many bad scrollbar replacements i almost puke of the thought

[06:28:51] <lintguy> Cork: GOD DAMNIT, you are right! I'm so stupid! THANKS!
[06:28:56] <Cork> heh
[06:31:22] <frank_o> How do I flip `$.hasImmediateText = function(container) { return container.clone().find('*').remove().text() }` inside the function as opposed to doing `!$.hasImmediateText`?
[06:31:26] <lintguy> See, that's why i love IRC, friendly people telling you that youre an idiot
[06:32:08] <frank_o> `return !container...` doesn't seem to work.
[06:32:16] <decx> you did that, we would be more subtle lintguy ^^
[06:32:44] <lintguy> decx: very true, but that's not always true, is it ;-)
[06:32:48] <Cork> lintguy: .hasImmediateText = function(container) { return container.clone().find('*').remove().text().length > 0 }
[06:33:00] <frank_o> cheerio Cork !
[06:33:24] <decx> oh right the text without elements
[06:33:36] <lintguy> frank_o: You have a phonecall, it's Cork, he called the wrong person.
[06:33:38] <decx> fiddling around myself http://jsfiddle.net/tyohnmb0/
[06:34:00] <Cork> ugg...
[06:34:04] <Cork> lintguy: sorry
[06:34:15] <frank_o> Cork: that seems to be the same as return container.clone().find('*').remove().text() (which will return true for all cases that does *not* have immediate text)
[06:34:18] <lintguy> No problem dude
[06:34:20] <lintguy> it happens
[06:34:44] <Cork> frank_o: the > 0 is only true if there is text
[06:36:59] <frank_o> Cork: basically only the last paragraph should get borders here: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/we1qenh0/7/
[06:37:54] <frank_o> Cork: I could do `!$.hasImmediateText($(this))` but that doesnt make much sense semantically
[06:38:20] <frank_o> or I could just rename the function to `$.doesNotHaveImmediateText`
[06:39:48] <frank_o> decx: well i dont really know what to say :)
[06:40:02] <decx> hm?
[06:40:03] <frank_o> other than.. you may stop fiddling :)
[06:40:16] <decx> i did about 20 minutes ago
[06:40:25] <frank_o> haha
[06:40:25] <decx> was just laying there barren in my tabs
[06:40:36] <decx> because i forgot about it when a client called
[06:42:50] <namenone> Hey, can someone help me out
[06:43:09] <decx> no
[06:43:11] <namenone> im trying to search through array elements for any element containing the character X, is this possible
[06:43:13] <namenone> haha
[06:43:20] <decx> indexOf('X')
[06:45:32] <namenone> thanks decx ill take a look
[06:46:42] <mylord> what’s wrong with this? how come the ajax isn’t returning the html content? http://jsfiddle.net/adaptivedev/582j4ajj/
[06:49:14] <decx> you never look for the content
[06:49:22] <decx> it's in the first argument of your success function
[06:49:36] <Horacsio> helllo: why doesnt the second function work? :( http://jsfiddle.net/baannng/tnLh7cvb/5/
[06:50:02] <Horacsio> I need the minus icon to roll back and become to plus icon again :(
[06:50:16] <frank_o> How does one get `$.hasImmediateText` to highlight the paragraphs *with* immediate text and not the ones without? (other than doing `!$.hasImmediateText`)
[06:50:47] <decx> Horacsio .imgminus doesnt exist yet when the second function gets executed
[06:50:51] <mylord> decx: even the alert doesn’t happen tho
[06:51:09] <decx> it does
[06:51:25] <frank_o> Forgot the new fiddle sorry: http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/bracpfdL/3/
[06:51:27] <Horacsio> it doesnt? :S
[06:51:56] <mylord> decx: only the first one, no?
[06:52:08] <Horacsio> decx: what’s missing there so the function exists?! :S
[06:53:46] <decx> Horacsio dont have 2 functions
[06:53:52] <Horacsio> hhmmm
[06:53:58] <Horacsio> let me see
[06:55:23] <decx> Horacsio quick job http://jsfiddle.net/tnLh7cvb/6/
[06:55:45] <Horacsio> a conditional :)
[06:55:59] <Horacsio> why prop instead of attr?
[06:56:08] <decx> http://jsfiddle.net/tnLh7cvb/7/ even
[06:56:21] <decx> no idea what rotate( bind: click: was supposed to do
[06:56:25] <decx> or why it worked
[06:56:37] <walidvb> decx: looks nice, anyways
[06:56:52] <decx> attr changes the markup, prop changes the property directly
[06:56:55] <Horacsio> this is based on an example from rotation plugin.
[06:57:07] <decx> i would use css3 anyway
[06:57:16] <decx> but it does work like this so yay
[06:57:19] <Horacsio> I was wondering if I need this plugin to rotate like it is now...
[06:57:28] <decx> not really
[06:57:47] <Horacsio> do you know a working example with CSS?
[06:57:48] <walidvb> i bind events via $(document).on('click', '.reply_link', doSmth), but it deosn't work for ajax loaded content.
[06:58:34] <walidvb> content is loaded via angular $http, and inserted via $.html()
[06:58:57] <walidvb> but the click event doesn't fire
[06:59:10] <walidvb> not too sure how to debug that..
[07:00:05] <decx> well there you go mixing angular and jquery
[07:00:10] <decx> world of pain
[07:01:01] <walidvb> decx: well, angular includes jquery. anyways, not sure how that would affect anything?
[07:02:04] <frank_o> Cork: managed to flip it :P http://jsfiddle.net/frank_o/bracpfdL/4/
[07:02:04] <bbclover> hi guys I see var workflowGraphContainer = $("#workflowGraphContainer").get(0); which is some id selector which is made into a jquery object, but what is the .get(0) at the end? I usually do it without the .get(0)
[07:02:11] <bbclover> well to be fair I've never done .get(0)...
[07:06:12] <decx> Horacsio http://jsfiddle.net/tnLh7cvb/8/
[07:06:34] <ThKo> Hi, I’ve got a <li>-tag with an ID…For example: <li id=„q_12“> … Now I’ve got a loop where I would add a data-icon to every <li> tag… What is the best way? $(…).attr( ‚data-icon‘ , ‚xyz‘ ) ? Thanks :)
[07:07:08] <Cork> ThKo: .data('icon' 'xyz')
[07:07:17] <ThKo> Ah thanks ok Cork  :)
[07:07:32] <decx> that doesnt add a tag though
[07:07:39] <decx> that adds data in the cache
[07:07:40] <Cork> *attribute
[07:07:45] <Cork> :)
[07:07:45] <decx> right
[07:07:48] <decx> attribute
[07:08:09] <decx> doesnt really matter though unless you do css content: attr(data-stuff)
[07:08:29] <Horacsio> decx: thank you
[07:08:33] <decx> that's just about the only usecase i can image though
[07:09:02] <david89> Hello. Would running something like $('#somediv .someclass') always return a list with the same order?
[07:09:32] <decx> if your markup doesnt change yes
[07:09:46] <david89> decx: perfect
[07:10:06] <david89> decx: is it the order they appear in the markup?
[07:10:28] <decx> yes, and if you .sort() a collection you'll have to append it again to have an effect
[07:10:35] <bbclover> pls gois does anyone know about the var a = $('#someidselector').get(0)? I don't know what this .get(0) be
[07:10:57] <decx> it gets the 0th element of this collection
[07:11:06] <decx> 0nd?
[07:11:07] <bbclover> what's a collection?
[07:11:11] <decx> 0st!
[07:11:19] <david89> decx: what would be the opposite (last element) of what bbclover is asking?
[07:11:19] <bbclover> I thought this was that one dom element?
[07:11:24] <decx> it is
[07:11:34] <bbclover> even without the .get(0)
[07:11:47] <decx> i dont know if get can do the eq - magic
[07:11:55] <decx> so probably get(length-1)
[07:12:06] <bbclover> length of what though?
[07:12:18] <bbclover> this.length - 1?
[07:12:19] <david89> decx: I'll stick with .last()
[07:12:22] <decx> right last
[07:12:32] <decx> well that's a jquery wrapped object though
[07:12:34] <bbclover> but hey guys I just don't understand
[07:12:41] <bbclover> we have multiple objects when we do this?
[07:12:52] <DeliriumTremens> I'm using jqueryui, just messing with the tabs function.  On their demos they work just fine in IE10 but when I try the same thing they are not rendered at all (works in FF and Chrome): https://pastee.org/qgquy
[07:12:56] <bbclover> it returns an array when I do var a = $('#sommat')?
[07:13:05] <DeliriumTremens> is there some secret trick to making jqueryui function correctly in IE?
[07:13:21] <david89> bbclover: I believe a collection would be more correct
[07:13:32] <decx> it's an array like object
[07:15:15] <Xatenev> Hello
[07:15:19] <Xatenev> Can anybody help me?
[07:15:20] <bbclover> but idselectors should be unique
[07:15:25] <Xatenev> I have a lot of checkboxes, if any of those is checked
[07:15:31] <bbclover> so say if I did without the .get(0)
[07:15:31] <Xatenev> an ajax call shud start
[07:15:34] <bbclover> would it just operate on the first one?
[07:15:38] <Xatenev> How do i do that in the best way?
[07:15:49] <Xatenev> (I would accept any way) :D
[07:17:49] <frank_o> one love! im out
[07:21:07] <decx> Xatenev use the change event
[07:22:42] <LiENUS> so this'll be sufficiently vague as to be unanswerable but here goes...
[07:22:56] <decx> 42
[07:23:39] <LiENUS> i have a <select> list that i do $('select').on("keyup change"
[07:23:55] <LiENUS> to ajaxy pull data from the database and fill out the rest of the fields
[07:24:15] <LiENUS> i'm using keyup because there was concern that someone would find a way to trigger a submit without triggering a change thus leaving the price fields blank
[07:24:36] <decx> unlikely
[07:24:53] <decx> keyup to ajax is just asking for trouble
[07:24:59] <decx> unless you debounce that
[07:25:00] <LiENUS> i have someone who swears they managed to several times but naturally when i asked her to show me she couldnt
[07:25:18] <decx> that's when you call out loud "shenanigans!"
[07:25:23] <LiENUS> now i have a problem in that this select list is the default field for the page and one of my users has a 'calc' button on her keyboard she uses to pull up the calculator to work with data
[07:25:29] <LiENUS> the 'calc' button is triggering the keyup...
[07:25:59] <mbrzuzy> why not just use the change event?
[07:26:30] <LiENUS> mbrzuzy, i have a user who swears she was able to trigger a submit of the field without triggering the change (not her exact words but thats the jist of what she described)
[07:27:01] <mbrzuzy> maybe the select box was focused some way and the user hit enter
[07:27:32] <LiENUS> mbrzuzy, aye but once the select box closes the change event is triggered, hitting enter with the select box up just triggers change and doesnt submit
[07:27:46] <LiENUS> actually for that matter hitting enter on the select box even with it closed doesnt submit
[07:28:37] <LiENUS> i wonder if her bug is still in the tracker i'm just gonna reopen it if it is and revert keyup for now
[07:29:35] <LiENUS> iunno is there another thing i should be doing other than just change on the select box? that i could do instead of keyup?
[07:29:41] <Biappi> hello guys... i need some help in trying to understand a dom nodes leak
[07:29:49] <LiENUS> or is there some way to avoid catching random 'calc' buttons keyup on keypads?
[07:29:59] <Biappi> it's two days trying to get to the bottom to no avail, is this a good channel for this kind of help
[07:30:00] <Biappi> ?
[07:30:08] <decx> you can accept specific chars
[07:30:11] <LiENUS> i was surprised that button even triggers a keyup event since its not used for input but rather for launching an application
[07:30:37] <LiENUS> decx, my concern with that is its just one computer with that button
[07:30:46] <decx> well just listen to change
[07:31:33] <LiENUS> is there any other thing i can listen to to catch scrolls through the list?
[07:31:37] <LiENUS> change only fires when the list is closed...
[07:41:04] <bbclover> does anyone know how to move an dom element down to the bottom when you scroll? I've tried position: fixed but I don't want to do it with css. I'm doing this right now: http://jsbin.com/neqakefozoni/1/ and it works, but if I keep scrolling the size of the page keep increasing too haha
[07:41:14] <bbclover> so I can scroll down forever and it'll keep increasing bit by bit
[07:41:47] <bbclover> better link: http://jsbin.com/neqakefozoni/1/edit?js
[07:42:22] <decx> why dont you want to use fixed?
[07:43:20] <bbclover> cause it's ruining everything. There is a lot of css on the page and when I do fixed it'll like make it larger or make it overlap other elements
[07:43:59] <LiENUS> bbclover, css is the proper place to do this just fyi
[07:45:23] <bbclover> like this: http://stackoverflow.com/a/5463697 LiENUS ?
[07:47:51] <juslintek> Hi, how to call shift+tab action on arrow backwards?
[07:53:15] <KamalKaur> Greetings!
[07:53:27] <KamalKaur> I'm working with jquery. Is anyone familiar with these errors in the Firefox browser console which appeared suddenly. : http://serv.devplace.in/~kamal/console.png
[07:54:22] <decx> these are just warnings
[07:54:27] <decx> afaik
[07:54:53] <KamalKaur> decx: But nothing was there till yesterday before I updated my browser
[07:54:58] <juslintek> KamalKaur is css lol :-)
[07:55:01] <juslintek> its*
[07:55:07] <LiENUS> got a fix, added a seperate on keyup to listen for just up and down keys
[07:55:14] <bbclover> yeah css just makes resizing the page when the thing is fixed cut it off
[07:55:19] <LiENUS> and trigger .change when up or down is pressed
[07:55:20] <KamalKaur> juslintek: Sorry?
[07:55:23] <bbclover> I need to be variable in height and width depending on the page
[07:55:36] <decx> maybe it didnt show warnings beforehand
[07:55:50] <decx> click the arrow next to css and untick warnings
[07:55:56] <LiENUS> now back to utf8 fixes
[07:56:12] <decx> your browser will just put these warnings when it encounters stuff that is for other browsers
[07:56:19] <juslintek> KamalKaur, it doesn't accept those parameters, so make rules which execute them on specific browsers only, if you wont want to see those warnings.
[07:57:20] <KamalKaur> juslintek: But I'm using jquery-ui css... also yet accessing the online source. Can you elaborate please elaborate more for what i need to do?
[07:58:04] <decx> go on any website and you'll see plenty of warnings and nobody cares
[07:58:41] <KamalKaur> But why?
[07:58:58] <KamalKaur> Should one really not care at all about them?
[07:58:59] <juslintek> http://api.jquery.com/jquery.csshooks/ and http://api.jquery.com/jquery.browser/
[07:59:17] <juslintek> Use one to identify browser and other to apply browser specific css
[07:59:46] <KamalKaur> okay
[08:01:11] <decx> or dont nobody cares :D
[08:01:41] <KamalKaur> decx: :D
[08:01:51] <KamalKaur> but why don't they care?
[08:02:31] <KamalKaur> juslintek: Yes, the sites you linked, they also spit all that :P
[08:02:42] <decx> because setting up specific css for all browsers is pointless busy work when browser will just drop the rules they dont know anyway
[08:02:48] <KamalKaur> and even more than what I was getting..
[08:03:04] <KamalKaur> Fair enough :)
[08:03:11] <decx> if you get paid hourly then by all means go ahead
[08:03:12] <decx> :D
[08:03:12] <KamalKaur> Many thanks.
[08:03:13] <Pendrea__> Hey everyone! I am trying to do something in jQuery. 1) Let's say I have the following array: ['correct','correct','incorrect'] and I want to replace all the letters in a jQuery element so that it adds a span with a class with the value of the array, like: <span class='incorrect'>letter</span>; How would I do such a thing?
[08:03:18] <KamalKaur> :D
[08:03:23] <KamalKaur> Grool!
[08:03:43] <Pendrea__> I can't use .text(), since then I would miss the text within <p> tags as well
[08:03:45] <juslintek> KamalKaur, because noone told them to care lol :-D
[08:04:01] <KamalKaur> :D
[08:04:15] <KamalKaur> And now you people told me not to care ;)
[08:05:53] <juslintek> KamalKaur, you can fix it if you want super clean webpage. But what everyone means, that it won't affect performance and regular user won't check console anyway.
[08:06:32] <decx> like i said if you get paid hourly it's good padding
[08:07:41] <decx> 6 hours for one Landinpage with 4 paragraphs? - no errors in console though - take my money
[08:10:17] <juslintek> So anyone specialist at overriding keys with jquery
[08:14:07] <Otineb> can anyone tell me why my validateField() function returns undefined here? http://jsfiddle.net/ds23ddbm/5/
[08:14:11] <Pendrea__> Could anyone look at this question? https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26407934/substitute-specific-letters-in-document-with-spans
[08:14:27] <Otineb> someone pointed out that I’m not “returning from it” but I dont know what that means
[08:15:00] <Pendrea__> Otineb: If you cannot modify, it's not returning anything
[08:15:15] <Pendrea__> Wait, it's not returning anything at all
[08:15:34] <Otineb> How would I modify it so it DOES return something?
[08:16:19] <Pendrea__> What are you trying to do?
[08:16:25] <Otineb> Title Case that input
[08:16:46] <Otineb> im sort of trapped in a shitty CMS that gives me super limited javascript access
[08:16:58] <Otineb> I can drop a snippet between in that gap
[08:17:00] <Pendrea__> You don't have jQuery?
[08:17:09] <Otineb> in this case I cant use any libraries
[08:17:13] <Otineb> it’s horrible
[08:17:19] <Otineb> I’m thinking suicide might be easier
[08:17:41] <decx> there http://jsfiddle.net/ds23ddbm/6/
[08:18:30] <Otineb> decx: wtf. So my += was no good???
[08:18:41] <decx> it would just add the same thing over and over again
[08:18:42] <Pendrea__> No, since then you're adding to a value
[08:18:52] <Otineb> hahaha
[08:18:57] <Otineb> yes suicide is best
[08:18:59] <Otineb> thanks man
[08:19:06] <Pendrea__> decx: Are you good with jQuery as well?
[08:19:10] <decx> also the validate field function has to be in the window
[08:19:10] <Otineb> yea
[08:19:13] <Otineb> im great with
[08:19:26] <juslintek> How to call shift+tab action?
[08:19:27] <decx> you had it in another scope
[08:19:30] <Pendrea__> I really need to solve this for my work, but it's been ailing me
[08:19:31] <Pendrea__> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26407934/substitute-specific-letters-in-document-with-spans
[08:21:30] <decx> a lot of busywork with contents() and textnode replacing
[08:21:39] <Otineb> decx: right. In production it is in the window. That makes sense now
[08:48:26] <solexious> I want to search for id's (attached to tr s) confined to within a tbody tag with a set id, how can I do that?
[08:55:08] <BillCriswell> solexious: I'd use filter if you need to get by multiple ids.
[08:55:33] <BillCriswell> I'd try to put classes on them instead, though.
[08:56:55] <BillCriswell> $('#some-tbody tr').filter(function(){ return this.id.indexOf(['id1', 'id2', 'id3']) > -1; });
[08:57:26] <BillCriswell> If you want something more jQuery looking you can do $('#some-tbody').find('#id1, #id2, #id3');
[09:21:25] <dmsuperman> solexious: Why wouldn't you just search for the IDs directly? There will only ever be one of them (they are IDs, not classes, after all), so it's not like the extra tbody filter is doing anything
[09:22:08] <robertmaxrees> actually, that extra filter IS doing something - slowing things down.
[09:22:58] <dmsuperman> heh well yeah that
[09:23:03] <robertmaxrees> :D
[09:37:17] <Omar-> Question: adding data to object while looping. http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/3efdjbex/
[09:37:34] <Omar-> lines 3 - 6
[09:37:45] <Omar-> I'm unable to add by index
[09:37:54] <Omar-> cbs[i] = whatever doesn't work
[09:38:30] <Omar-> so I ended up using ID as object propery cbs[this.id] = whatever
[09:39:01] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[09:39:28] <robertmaxrees> you can edit by index just fine.
[09:40:04] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/3efdjbex/3/ should work.
[09:40:21] <mbrzuzy> doesnt cbs {} instantiate an object and not an array? Maybe it's related to that
[09:40:27] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[09:40:44] <robertmaxrees> var cbs = {}; would be an object. var cbs = []; would be an array.
[09:40:47] <mbrzuzy> ah you already got it :)
[09:41:00] <Omar-> but I want an object not an array
[09:41:05] <Omar-> not possible?
[09:41:09] <robertmaxrees> then what you have now is correct.
[09:41:15] <robertmaxrees> (i don't see what's broken in your case)
[09:43:10] <Omar-> robertmaxrees its not borken, i thought I can do cbs[i] = { "id":this.id, "checked": "foo" }
[09:43:15] <robertmaxrees> sure.
[09:43:20] <robertmaxrees> you CAN do that.
[09:43:26] <Omar-> hmmmm
[09:43:28] <Omar-> let me try
[09:43:29] <robertmaxrees> array indexes are objects, like everything else.
[09:43:30] <Omar-> :D
[09:45:55] <Omar-> robertmaxrees i was doing something wrong for sure http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/3efdjbex/4/
[09:45:58] <Omar-> thanks mate
[09:46:10] <robertmaxrees> that's not what you think it is.
[09:46:21] <robertmaxrees> you're still editing a plain object there.
[09:46:47] <Omar-> robertmaxrees mind my ignorance, i'm not a programmer
[09:46:49] <robertmaxrees> var cbs = {}; is an object, not an array.
[09:46:56] <robertmaxrees> you want var cbs = []; instead.
[09:47:02] <Omar-> and it took me some time to understand array and object
[09:47:09] <Omar-> yea i know {} object
[09:47:17] <robertmaxrees> use [] when you mean array.
[09:47:31] <Omar-> ok, noted
[09:47:37] <robertmaxrees> which is what you want in this case.
[09:48:00] <robertmaxrees> though to make things more confusion, arrays ARE objects.  they just have special rules around their property names.
[09:48:10] <robertmaxrees> and some extra methods/properties
[09:48:13] <Omar-> usually array better to deal with than objects?
[09:48:19] <robertmaxrees> depends on what you need.
[09:48:30] <robertmaxrees> if order matters, use an array.  if you want named keys, use an object.
[09:48:35] <Omar-> array is easier to manipulate unlike object
[09:48:40] <robertmaxrees> not true.
[09:48:45] <Omar-> .slice, .splice, .length
[09:48:48] <Omar-> yea?
[09:49:04] <robertmaxrees> those don't make them easier to manipulate necessarily.
[09:49:11] <robertmaxrees> they just have those extra properties/methods available.
[09:50:11] <Omar-> each one has it's own uses of course
[09:50:18] <robertmaxrees> bingo.
[09:50:26] <Omar-> for global variables, object is better i guess
[09:50:33] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[09:50:36] <Omar-> lol
[09:50:41] <robertmaxrees> there's no singular "better" or "worse"
[09:50:44] <buzzlewoo> is there a simple light box I can use in Wordpress?
[09:50:47] <Omar-> forget it robertmaxrees i told you i'm not a programmer
[09:50:52] <Omar-> haha
[09:50:54] <robertmaxrees> Omar- then learn :)
[09:50:58] <robertmaxrees> it's not that hard.
[09:51:11] <robertmaxrees> all about the right tool for the job.
[09:51:23] <Omar-> robertmaxrees i'm willing to of course :) i learn through doing mistakes
[09:51:30] <Omar-> that's why I learned jQM
[09:51:37] <Omar-> and now helping others in jQM
[09:51:43] <robertmaxrees> :)
[09:51:54] <Omar-> why = how
[09:52:02] <Omar-> trial and error is my guru
[09:52:13] <Omar-> of course, reading docs
[09:59:53] <brian1001> Hi people
[10:00:08] <brian1001> may i ask a question regarding JQT here ?
[10:01:17] <mbrzuzy> brian1001, what's JQT?
[10:01:38] <brian1001> http://jqtjs.com/
[10:02:19] <mbrzuzy> ah.  I'm sure it's cool.  I don't think i'll be able to help though :)
[10:11:33] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ brian1001
[10:11:33] <b-ot> brian1001: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:11:53] <robertmaxrees> brian1001 basically, feel free to ask, just don't expect us to know anything about it :)
[10:18:08] <Scriptonaut> holy shit, why does safari treat JS so weirdly
[10:18:16] <robertmaxrees> JS or the DOM?
[10:18:24] <NoiseEee> besides the fact its a shit browser or
[10:18:41] <Scriptonaut> fml, I'm forced to use OS X at work, except chrome breaks the damn app
[10:18:46] <Scriptonaut> so I'm using safari
[10:18:54] <dmsuperman> there's firefox
[10:18:57] <dmsuperman> alternative fix the app to not suck
[10:18:58] <dmsuperman> :P
[10:19:02] <robertmaxrees> :D
[10:19:06] <Scriptonaut> ya, that would be the thing to do
[10:19:20] <Scriptonaut> I dunno why it's doing it though, it's just this specific version of chrome
[10:19:28] <dmsuperman> try chrome canary?
[10:19:32] <dmsuperman> that's the latest chrome for OS X
[10:19:50] <Scriptonaut> it is?
[10:19:56] <robertmaxrees> *Latest chrome period.
[10:20:00] <robertmaxrees> windows, os x, etc.
[10:20:07] <Scriptonaut> does os x have chromium-browser?
[10:20:26] <dmsuperman> oh, I wasn't aware it existed on other platforms, I had never heard of it til I started using OS X
[10:20:38] <dmsuperman> when I searched chromium os x canary is what I got
[10:20:43] <robertmaxrees> dmsuperman yeah, the name is pretty funno imo.
[10:20:46] <robertmaxrees> gave me a chuckle.
[10:20:51] <dmsuperman> heh
[10:24:12] <Scriptonaut> how do I find out what type of thing a variable is
[10:24:18] <robertmaxrees> clarify?
[10:24:42] <Scriptonaut> god this is pissing me off. I have: var searchInput = $(".nav-bar-search input");
[10:24:58] <dmsuperman> yeah that would piss me off too
[10:24:58] <Scriptonaut> then I have: console.log('The Length ' + searchInput.length())
[10:25:07] <robertmaxrees> .length
[10:25:08] <dmsuperman> .length, not length()
[10:25:10] <robertmaxrees> not a function.
[10:25:19] <decx> there is no spoon()
[10:25:21] <Scriptonaut> I thought for jQuery it was length()
[10:25:25] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[10:25:29] <Scriptonaut> and for normal JS obejcts it was length
[10:25:33] <robertmaxrees> the jquery object is array-like, so it's a property.
[10:25:42] <robertmaxrees> just like normal arrays.
[10:25:43] <decx> there was size() at one point iirc
[10:25:59] <robertmaxrees> yeah, there was.  they killed it in 1.8
[10:26:09] <decx> wasnt that just length anyway?
[10:26:19] <robertmaxrees> basically, yeah.
[10:26:22] <Otineb> javascript doesnt have types of variables right? They are all basically strings. Nothing is defined as “int” or “double” right?
[10:26:25] <robertmaxrees> just extra overhead because it was a function call.
[10:26:33] <robertmaxrees> Otineb there are 6 data types.
[10:26:37] <Otineb> oh snap
[10:26:53] <decx> every number is a float unless you | 0
[10:27:19] <Otineb> but you dont have to declare the type right?
[10:27:25] <Otineb> like i’ve seen in Java
[10:27:26] <Scriptonaut> it's like Number, String, Bool, Undefined, Null, Object, Array right?
[10:27:27] <decx> no
[10:27:29] <robertmaxrees> correct.
[10:27:36] <robertmaxrees> Otineb you're correct.
[10:27:38] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut no.
[10:27:51] <Scriptonaut> what is it
[10:27:54] <robertmaxrees> sec
[10:28:02] <Scriptonaut> Object { 0: <input#search-input.search-query.h.tt-input>, length: 1, prevObject: Object, context: HTMLDocument → tasks, selector: ".nav-bar-search input" }
[10:28:12] <Scriptonaut> that's my searchInput var
[10:28:17] <robertmaxrees> Boolean, Null, Undefined, Number (IEEE 64-bit Double under the hood), String, Object
[10:28:22] <robertmaxrees> those are the 6 data types.
[10:28:33] <Scriptonaut> so an Array is just an object I assume?
[10:28:36] <robertmaxrees> yep.
[10:28:40] <Otineb> NaN
[10:28:41] <Scriptonaut> ah
[10:28:43] <Otineb> that’s right
[10:28:46] <robertmaxrees> NaN is a number, Otineb
[10:28:54] <Scriptonaut> so is Infinity
[10:28:58] <Otineb> oh it’s a non number number?
[10:29:04] <Scriptonaut> yeh
[10:29:05] <robertmaxrees> It's "Numeric Not a Number"
[10:29:09] <Otineb> haha
[10:29:16] <robertmaxrees> IEEE definition btw.
[10:29:18] <robertmaxrees> not a JS fail ;)
[10:29:22] <Otineb> gotcha
[10:29:24] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut arrays are identical to objects with special rules about their property names and some extra methods.
[10:30:39] <robertmaxrees> you can even set non-numeric properties on arrays.
[10:30:51] <Scriptonaut> I wish I could grep in irssi
[10:31:07] <Scriptonaut>  like: /names | grep "kukila"
[10:31:20] <Scriptonaut> he always spams me random shit in freenode channels
[10:31:27] <robertmaxrees> like what?
[10:32:06] <Otineb> so I’m trying to understand a function. It has “valStr” passed into it (which is just a string “asdf asdf asdf”). Then immediately this variable is defined. var m = split.exec(valStr);  …. which returns null… reading about exec() it expects regex before it.. is split.exec() right?
[10:32:12] <Scriptonaut> http://s422803032.mialojamiento.es
[10:32:20] <Scriptonaut> he gives me weird links like that
[10:32:23] <Scriptonaut> I assume he's a bot
[10:32:32] <decx> Scriptonaut do /mode Scriptonaut +R
[10:32:33] <Otineb> that’s creepy
[10:32:38] <robertmaxrees> Otineb could you fiddle up your code?
[10:32:42] <Scriptonaut> what's that do decx
[10:32:44] <decx> now people who dont have accounts cant message you
[10:32:50] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/bd0d0mzh/3/
[10:34:00] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut and letting us know helps, too :)
[10:34:17] <Scriptonaut> heh
[10:34:32] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: it’s a script from John Resig. Here’s a working fiddle without all my shackles. http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/bd0d0mzh/
[10:34:37] <decx> gotta work on that +o+b game duch
[10:34:43] <Otineb> trying to adapt it to my prison
[10:34:46] <decx> one line that shit
[10:34:57] <robertmaxrees> yeah i know.  lazy and take my time haha
[10:35:03] <Scriptonaut> does john resig chill in here?
[10:35:11] <decx> not anymore
[10:35:11] <robertmaxrees> sometimes.
[10:35:18] <Scriptonaut> he used to?
[10:35:19] <robertmaxrees> but yeah not normally.
[10:35:19] <decx> oh?
[10:35:24] <Otineb> cool
[10:35:28] <robertmaxrees> never seen him active though.
[10:35:36] <Scriptonaut> it's so weird when you realize semi famous people are in irc channels
[10:35:40] <robertmaxrees> he's kind of moved on.
[10:35:43] <Otineb> i know right
[10:36:01] <Scriptonaut> One of the channels I've been in for years, this guy would talk to me occasionally, turns out he's the guy who created grand theft auto
[10:36:08] <Otineb> holy shit
[10:36:21] <decx> forget gta, that means he was involved in lemmings
[10:36:34] <respek> lol
[10:36:41] <Scriptonaut> yep
[10:36:41] <robertmaxrees> so Otineb in http://jsfiddle.net/bsegovia/bd0d0mzh/3/ what are you trying to do?
[10:36:42] <Scriptonaut> that guy
[10:36:46] <Scriptonaut> mike daily or something
[10:36:48] <respek> my first, favorite game
[10:37:15] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: it’s a super cereal great title case
[10:37:22] <Scriptonaut> his username is like mdf2000
[10:37:34] <respek> anyone read javascript for ninjas>
[10:37:36] <respek> *?
[10:37:39] <robertmaxrees> Otineb what's broken in that link though?
[10:37:47] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: basically can handle capitalizing this string “mcHard rd
[10:37:51] <Otineb> oh
[10:37:58] <Otineb> well the second link works great
[10:38:02] <respek> or whatever his book is become a ninja at javascript? something like that>
[10:38:14] <Otineb> the first link is a simulation of my prison-like dev environment
[10:38:16] <robertmaxrees> Secrets of the JavaScript Ninja
[10:38:22] <Otineb> so I’m trying to get it work there.
[10:38:28] <Scriptonaut> mdf200*
[10:38:28] <respek> right
[10:38:34] <robertmaxrees> Otineb onblur="validateField(this)" :(
[10:38:35] <robertmaxrees> don't do that.
[10:38:43] <Otineb> cant control that
[10:38:48] <Otineb> hence my prison
[10:38:51] <robertmaxrees> why not?
[10:39:30] <Otineb> without boring you. It’s a super niche, required, proprietary CMS that the company bought.
[10:39:34] <robertmaxrees> okay.
[10:39:44] <robertmaxrees> welp - which line in that fiddle is broken then?
[10:40:30] <Otineb> i can only add “snippets” of javascript which drops inbetween rows 4 and 53
[10:41:14] <Otineb> well, im just trying to understand what is happening as it runs. Around line 17 var m returns null… which seems to feed the rest of it badness…maybe
[10:41:57] <Otineb> as you can see in the second link, it returns an expected value untouched. Once i drop in here it doesnt do didly
[10:42:52] <robertmaxrees> that's not what's broken.
[10:43:13] <brian1001> someone here with JQT (http://jqtjs.com/) experience?
[10:43:19] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ brian1001
[10:43:22] <b-ot> brian1001: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:44:01] <Otineb> hah
[10:44:26] <Otineb> so THAT’s the protocol
[10:44:34] <Otineb> i always feel like a meek mouse asking for crumbs
[10:44:42] <robertmaxrees> nah, not at all - just ask your question.
[10:45:00] <Otineb> cool
[10:45:39] <Otineb> robertmaxrees: so.. null is an expected result at that point?
[10:45:48] <robertmaxrees> one sec.
[10:45:53] <Otineb> ok
[10:46:09] <robertmaxrees> something very strange is going on.
[10:46:34] <robertmaxrees> valStr is not what you think it is.
[10:46:37] <robertmaxrees> that's your problem.
[10:46:39] <Otineb> oh
[10:46:53] <Otineb> it’s not just a string?
[10:47:08] <robertmaxrees> console log it.
[10:47:21] <Otineb> i did at line 9
[10:47:27] <Otineb> returns “asdf asd fas"
[10:47:29] <robertmaxrees> that's not the one inside the function ;)
[10:47:32] <robertmaxrees> do it INSIDE titleCaps.
[10:47:38] <Otineb> ok
[10:47:59] <Otineb> wth
[10:48:01] <robertmaxrees> the issue is curInput.value = titleCaps(curInput); ;)
[10:48:25] <robertmaxrees> the valStr that gets declared outside that function is different from the one you pass it.
[10:48:25] <Otineb> oh christ
[10:48:32] <Otineb> see
[10:48:42] <Otineb> i feel like I’m a membrane away from success
[10:48:49] <Otineb> then i get all sorts of twisted
[10:48:53] <robertmaxrees> partially why i avoid declaring functions in handlers like that.
[10:49:12] <robertmaxrees> but you apparently can't avoid it.
[10:49:18] <Otineb> yeah
[10:49:40] <Otineb> worse i cant use jquery which I’m way more comfy in than pure js but I think this is good for me ultimately
[10:49:52] <robertmaxrees> yeah it will be.
[10:50:10] <Otineb> thanks man. Gonna fire it up in production and see if it works
[10:50:57] <Scriptonaut> ok, does anyone know why the hell the first console.log is telling me that data-placeholder has a value, but then when I print the actual input object there is no data-placeholder
[10:51:03] <Scriptonaut> http://dpaste.com/23WG41H
[10:51:14] <robertmaxrees> use .data() btw
[10:51:39] <robertmaxrees> and that's not how you do that.
[10:51:40] <Scriptonaut> the jqueryobject isn't persisting, will it actually attach to the dom element?
[10:51:44] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[10:51:47] <robertmaxrees> use .data()
[10:51:56] <robertmaxrees> don't modify markup, modify object.  the data IS persisting.
[10:52:02] <robertmaxrees> check it using .data(), too.
[10:52:03] <Scriptonaut> ok I'll try that
[10:52:04] <robertmaxrees> not the markup.
[10:56:22] <Scriptonaut> robertmaxrees, still undefined for me
[10:56:32] <robertmaxrees> fiddle?
[10:56:35] <Scriptonaut> I don't get it, I'm using the same exact string to find it
[10:56:51] <Scriptonaut> I don't know how the hell I can fiddle this, it's like 10,000 lines in total
[10:56:58] <robertmaxrees> lol
[10:57:08] <Scriptonaut> I can give you code snipets
[10:57:10] <Scriptonaut> snippets*
[10:57:13] <robertmaxrees> put in just the input and the code in your dpaste.
[10:57:17] <robertmaxrees> that's a reduced test case.
[10:58:13] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xcrfw8j1/ like this.
[10:58:24] <Scriptonaut> I pmed as it has sensitive info
[10:58:39] <robertmaxrees> i just showed you what that test case would look like yo.
[10:58:52] <robertmaxrees> don't pm people sensitive info btw ;)
[10:59:04] <Scriptonaut> why don't you want pms?
[10:59:23] <robertmaxrees> i prefer to talk stuff out in the channel.
[10:59:36] <robertmaxrees> either way - look at the test case i just gave you.
[11:00:03] <robertmaxrees> the better way is like this: http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/xcrfw8j1/1/
[11:00:12] <VectorX> hi, i got two checkboxes as so, <input type="hidden" class="cat" name="cat[tom]" value="5"> <input type="hidden" class="cat" name="cat[tom]" value="">   on submit of the form the second inputbox is overwriting the first ones value and i get "" in the backend php, so on submit how can i make both of their values equal in the sense the one without a value will get one, the value can also be on
[11:00:12] <VectorX> the second input with the first empty
[11:00:43] <robertmaxrees> VectorX make a fiddle of your frontend code pls :)
[11:00:47] <sweet2k4> noob question: how would i accses the textnode of the h1 tag with jquery. i want to change test to foobar on a event <div id="previewTitle"> <h1>test</h1></div>
[11:01:05] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4 $('#previewTitle h1').text()
[11:01:12] <robertmaxrees> sweet2k4 $('#previewTitle h1').text('some new text') to set it.
[11:01:31] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: thanks!
[11:02:05] <decx> i feel like you'll be back soon because that was rather basic ^^
[11:02:06] <sweet2k4>  $('#previewTitle h1').text($('$someOtherVar')  works also?
[11:02:11] <robertmaxrees> nope.
[11:02:20] <VectorX> js fiddle in a bit more clear way http://jsfiddle.net/40rnfg3c/
[11:02:22] <robertmaxrees> because $('someOtherVar') is an object.
[11:02:28] <robertmaxrees> you probably want someOtherVar
[11:02:33] <decx> a tag even
[11:03:01] <robertmaxrees> *not a string or number so it won't show the way you expect.
[11:03:27] <robertmaxrees> VectorX rephrease your question - it doesn't make sense.
[11:03:53] <VectorX> also what ever thats in the name part array will vary but it will always be name="cat[something]"
[11:04:06] <sweet2k4> okey well, like if its an input $('#previewTitle h1').text($('$input.val()')
[11:04:19] <robertmaxrees> $('$input').val()
[11:04:57] <sweet2k4> oh yes ok, well thanks il try it our
[11:04:58] <sweet2k4> out
[11:06:33] <VectorX> robertmaxrees http://jsfiddle.net/528a2x58/  on submit how do i get the value of the second <input type="hidden" class="cat" name="cat[tom]" value="">  to also be 5
[11:06:41] <VectorX> the order of the fields can be reveresed
[11:06:55] <VectorX> they are marked 1 , 2
[11:08:23] <robertmaxrees> so you could have multiple cat[tom] inputs and whichever one is empty needs the value of the one that isn't?
[11:08:29] <robertmaxrees> why aren't you handling this in your backend?
[11:08:32] <VectorX> yes
[11:09:04] <VectorX> its manipulated in the front end so the data is lost to the backend
[11:09:21] <robertmaxrees> erm, kay
[11:09:30] <VectorX> its just two choices for the same name
[11:09:43] <robertmaxrees> don't see the use case, but either way.
[11:11:12] <robertmaxrees> one sec, i'll show you one way.
[11:11:33] <VectorX> ok, but i need to have both inputs
[11:11:43] <robertmaxrees> hold up yo.
[11:11:47] <robertmaxrees> one thing at a time ;)
[11:13:47] <sweet2k4> robertmaxrees: alright this was the working code: $("#previewTitle h1").text($('#infoTitle').val()); thanks for the help
[11:14:11] <robertmaxrees> VectorX http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/528a2x58/1/
[11:14:15] <codecutter> How do you get rid of the background scroll after appending a block to the bady element, which causes the appended section to appear at forefront with to scrollbars visible
[11:14:20] <robertmaxrees> awkward, but close to what you want.
[11:14:25] <codecutter> scrollbar*
[11:14:41] <codecutter> two*
[11:14:55] <Scriptonaut> robertmaxrees, data is not persisting
[11:15:09] <robertmaxrees> Scriptonaut the example i showed you works.  data persists.
[11:16:17] <robertmaxrees> do not select the element and look at the markup in your inspector.
[11:16:26] <robertmaxrees> that will not reflect things the right way.
[11:17:21] <codecutter> How do you get rid of the background scrollbar after appending a block to the bady element, causing the appended section to appear in front.  I can see 2 scrollbar.
[11:17:56] <Scriptonaut> I'm using the same selector, it's like the element is being destroyed and remade or something
[11:17:59] <robertmaxrees> codecutter that's a CSS thing - overflow: hidden; on the body iirc.
[11:18:15] <codecutter> ah!
[11:18:20] <robertmaxrees> ask in #css though.
[11:18:25] <VectorX> robertmaxrees looks good, is that pretty optimized or could it be improved ?
[11:18:44] <VectorX> ie class will also be .cat
[11:18:58] <robertmaxrees> VectorX selecting on that class instead would be smart.
[11:19:13] <VectorX> yeah
[11:19:31] <robertmaxrees> just giving you a generic example.
[11:19:43] <robertmaxrees> that .each() and the .filters() are the takeaways
[11:20:18] <VectorX> yeah with the class there will only be a few to test, so i guess it would be ok then
[11:20:23] <VectorX> maybe 100 inputs max
[11:20:34] <VectorX> in the worst case
[11:20:45] <VectorX> thanks for the code
[11:23:09] <ThKo> Good evening guys, does anyone see an error in this fiddle? I don’t see the wood for the trees. The problem is line 39 … I try to call the function above but the returned value is always undefined. http://jsfiddle.net/ox2wkc6j/ Thanks a lot! Or isn’t it possible to return a value from an executeSql function? :-)
[11:24:30] <robertmaxrees> you're not returning the way you think you are.
[11:24:56] <robertmaxrees> line 15 returns to tx.executeSql
[11:25:12] <ThKo> yes it is the success part.
[11:25:27] <ThKo> I try to debug with console log or alert
[11:25:40] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't mean tx.executeSql is returning to db.transaction.
[11:26:18] <ThKo> Ah I understand. But you understand what my goal is?
[11:26:31] <robertmaxrees> and db.transaction isn't returning to checkIfAnswered, and that doesn't return anything..
[11:26:47] <robertmaxrees> sure - you're expecting checkIfAnswered() to return something.
[11:27:00] <ThKo> Yep in best case my output
[11:27:51] <ThKo> Found a solution: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7816509/web-sql-select-transaction-return-value Maybe this will help me
[11:28:43] <jaspertheghost> var sel = document.getElementsByTagName("select")[0], opts = [];    can someone explain this line of code to me i dont understand why [0] is there and a comma and opt=[] i know opts=[] is making an array but why all this when assigning to "sel" var
[11:30:05] <decx> getElementsByTagName creates a collection of nodes, [0] selects the first select in that collection; opts = [] creates an empty array
[11:31:08] <jaspertheghost> so sel becomes an array with the first node being the only option?
[11:31:14] <jaspertheghost> or element i should say
[11:31:52] <decx> sel is just a reference to the first element in that html collection
[11:32:56] <jaspertheghost> whats the point in doing opts  = [] then?
[11:33:33] <jaspertheghost> it gives u an object u can use later on but i've never seen anything declared like that
[11:33:40] <decx> probably to push something in there
[11:33:41] <nisargjhaveri> opts is another variable set to empty array.
[11:34:52] <jaspertheghost> and u can do opts.push and itll push into the ekement with tag name select
[11:36:31] <nisargjhaveri> opts and sel are tow different unrelated variables.
[11:36:53] <nisargjhaveri> var a=0, b=4; is exactly same as var a=0; var b=4;
[11:37:43] <nisargjhaveri> When you do opts.push(something), it'll push 'something' to opts. Nothing to do with sel
[11:38:19] <robertmaxrees> would be good for you to learn about objects and properties to get your head around the syntax.
[11:50:46] <tinkiete> hi to all
[11:56:48] <BillCriswell> hi you you.
[11:56:53] <BillCriswell> hi to you*
[11:58:44] <jaspertheghost> how can i get a button onclick event not to cause the form its in to not submit....
[11:59:29] <NoiseEee> jaspertheghost: <button type="button">I will not submit no matter what</button>
[12:00:42] <jaspertheghost> thank tyou
[12:00:43] <BillCriswell> Always found it weird the buttons element default type property wasn't button.
[12:00:48] <robertmaxrees> jaspertheghost you can also bind to the form's submit event instead.
[12:07:26] <jaspertheghost> i need to submit via post a list of all items inside a particular select menu (one of those where there is button move to left move to right)
[12:07:54] <jaspertheghost> should i seraialize the values and place inside a hidden input before submission?
[12:08:09] <robertmaxrees> hidden form imo.
[12:08:19] <robertmaxrees> or just submit the form itself.
[12:08:34] <jaspertheghost> it wont be the select valu's though
[12:08:40] <jaspertheghost> so it wont submit teh data
[12:08:47] <robertmaxrees> huh?  why not?
[12:09:08] <jaspertheghost> becuase the values wont be selected
[12:09:11] <jaspertheghost> its not a multi select
[12:09:23] <jaspertheghost> and i dont want them to be selected i just want to submit everything thats in the box itself
[12:09:30] <robertmaxrees> ah, you need all the values in it - got it.  yeah, i'd create a hidden input or something instead.
[12:09:32] <jaspertheghost> things get moved left to right things on the right are things i want saved
[12:09:37] <jaspertheghost> ok coo
[12:09:39] <robertmaxrees> or custom craft your post object.
[12:09:50] <jaspertheghost> idk how to do that in JS
[12:12:49] <mbrzuzy> pass something like this in the post data
[12:13:12] <mbrzuzy> data: { formData: form.serialize(), extra: yourselectboxcontenthere}
[12:14:20] <robertmaxrees> only if you're doing ajax though.
[12:22:20] <respek> robertmaxrees: Hi there :) hope you're doing well today
[12:23:11] <respek> love digging through the old conversations in here
[12:24:00] <robertmaxrees> i'm already.  sleepy.
[12:25:53] <respek> I've been toying with some of the dietary concepts within this thread. http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2imk82/what_does_your_diet_consist_of/
[12:26:52] <jaspertheghost> var option = document.createElement('option');   i cant add this option object to more than 1 select menu only 1 if i reverse the order of the sel.add(option); and sel2.add(option)  it will add to one or the other
[12:27:41] <robertmaxrees> jaspertheghost you need to clone the element and add the clone.
[12:27:42] <jaspertheghost> and it only adds to the one that is listed second not even the first so with the above example it would add to sel2 not sel 1
[12:27:53] <jaspertheghost> is there a reason behind this?
[12:28:14] <robertmaxrees> because you're moving the original around.
[12:28:20] <jaspertheghost> ahh ok
[12:28:22] <robertmaxrees> you need to clone it and append the cloned version.
[12:29:29] <jaspertheghost> how do i close  it?
[12:29:37] <jaspertheghost> option.cloneNode(true);?
[12:30:14] <robertmaxrees> !g javascript clone node
[12:30:14] <b-ot> robertmaxrees: Node.cloneNode() - Web API Interfaces | MDN → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node.cloneNode
[12:30:21] <jaspertheghost> thanks
[12:30:27] <robertmaxrees> google is your friend :)
[12:34:09] <farn5w0rth> im looking to expand out a menu on click - anyone have any examples of cool css animations for a navigation?
[12:34:17] <robertmaxrees> ask in #css :)
[12:36:12] <farn5w0rth> robertmaxrees: can be pure jquery also
[12:36:26] <robertmaxrees> hahaha "pure jquery"
[12:38:39] <farn5w0rth> sorry not pure
[12:39:21] <robertmaxrees> i know what you meant.  just thought it was funny.
[12:42:05] <ThKo> Good evening guys, any hints what I can do that var answeres is available at the point line 29? Thanks a lot :) http://jsfiddle.net/ox2wkc6j/1/
[12:42:32] <robertmaxrees> it's available.
[12:43:01] <robertmaxrees> your code doesn't make any sense.
[12:43:13] <ThKo> :D
[12:43:18] <robertmaxrees> your for loop is resetting that var every time it runs.
[12:43:43] <ThKo> Maybe better to work with an array
[12:43:48] <robertmaxrees> move var answeres = ""; to below var legend = "";
[12:43:56] <robertmaxrees> no need for that.
[12:44:27] <robertmaxrees> though are you just trying to turn rs from an array into a string separated with <br /> between each thing?
[12:45:29] <ThKo> My goal: I’ve a list of questions (length: len) … The <p> tag in line 32 should be the part of rs[z] of the specific question.
[12:45:44] <ThKo> Maybe I’ve to put all calls of detail_output into the loop?
[12:45:47] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't answer my question.
[12:46:19] <robertmaxrees> i assume rs is an array - is that correct?
[12:46:25] <ThKo> Yep
[12:46:41] <robertmaxrees> and you're just trying to turn it into a string with <br /> between every item?
[12:47:18] <ThKo> Yep for example: rs[0] = Cloud ; rs[1] = DropBox etc. So that I’ve Cloud<br />Dropbox etc.
[12:47:20] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/ox2wkc6j/2/
[12:47:21] <robertmaxrees> do this.
[12:47:41] <robertmaxrees> move the answeres var up, and then use .join() on the array instead of the for loop.
[12:49:21] <ThKo> Ok, sounds good. I’ll try it! Thanks a lot
[12:52:03] <SpaceF_> So question, can you take a string name pass that into a function and inside that function set a result to that name?
[12:52:23] <robertmaxrees> SpaceF_ mind setting up a fiddle showing whatyou mean?
[12:57:49] <SpaceF_> rough concept robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/tqxqy2k2/
[12:58:04] <SpaceF_> excuse the very primitive new object
[12:58:22] <robertmaxrees> wut
[12:58:23] <SpaceF_> but using youtube and need a way to differentiate between two different videos
[12:58:36] <robertmaxrees> window.'string_name' = player.playVideo(container, videoId); this doesn't make any sense.
[12:58:48] <SpaceF_> I know, because it's in quotes
[12:59:00] <SpaceF_> but I need identity to maintain it's value while setting to another
[12:59:18] <robertmaxrees> the quotes are invalid.
[12:59:20] <robertmaxrees> you can't do that.
[12:59:24] <ThKo> robertmaxrees: http://jsfiddle.net/ox2wkc6j/4/ You see line 27…I’ve tested it with it…But in this line it’s undefined…Maybe I’ve got a „thinking problem“…Do you see a bug? :)
[12:59:25] <SpaceF_> I realize that
[12:59:31] <SpaceF_> that's the point
[12:59:43] <robertmaxrees> SpaceF_ so back up to your original question - don't see how this is related.
[12:59:53] <SpaceF_> read the code
[13:00:02] <robertmaxrees> the code doens't make sense is what I'm saying.
[13:00:09] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to dynamically evaluate property names?
[13:00:46] <SpaceF_> I need to pass in a string name into a function and keep that name but set a global variable with that name to an object
[13:01:01] <SpaceF_> I know, it is silly
[13:01:08] <robertmaxrees> window['string_name'] = player.playVideo(container, videoId);
[13:01:13] <robertmaxrees> you want square brackets.
[13:01:38] <robertmaxrees> you can pass an object instead - var myName = 'string_name'; window[myName] = {};
[13:02:10] <ThKo> robertmaxrees: Yep, dynamically get the responses and put it into the <p> tag
[13:02:22] <robertmaxrees> ThKo talking to SpaceF_
[13:02:28] <robertmaxrees> what's your problem?
[13:02:36] <ThKo> http://jsfiddle.net/ox2wkc6j/4/ You see line 27…I’ve tested it with it…But in this line it’s undefined…Maybe I’ve got a „thinking problem“…Do you see a bug?
[13:02:53] <robertmaxrees> i saw your question.  don't spam ;)
[13:03:40] <robertmaxrees> checkIfAnswered is probably async.
[13:03:56] <robertmaxrees> move your detail_output right after you set the answeres var in there.
[13:05:55] <ThKo> Ok, I’ll test it. And sorry, don’t want to spam. I thought you haven’t found my question ;)
[13:53:02] <the8thbit|work> hello, I want to select only the instances of a class that are the <select> html tag
[13:53:10] <the8thbit|work> how would I do that in jquery?
[13:53:38] <the8thbit|work> I've tried $(".class_name select")
[13:57:06] <mbrzuzy> the8thbit|work did you try $('select.class_name') ?
[13:58:00] <the8thbit|work> mbrzuzy: not without the space, thanks
[14:02:05] <coffeemadness> hello
[14:02:12] <coffeemadness> im having a bit of  aproblem
[14:02:25] <coffeemadness> would be awesome if anyone could help me out a bit
[14:02:40] <coffeemadness> http://jsfiddle.net/do3g4z78/
[14:02:45] <Omar-> ?ask
[14:02:45] <b-ot> Omar-: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[14:03:03] <coffeemadness> i need the images to switch between more z-indexes
[14:03:22] <coffeemadness> so that images dont go back and forth so much
[14:06:17] <Omar-> you need help from UI expert
[14:06:31] <coffeemadness> ouch =(
[14:06:38] <Omar-> coffeemadness I dont know much about draggable widget
[14:07:05] <Omar-> but I guess you need to check stacked images
[14:07:14] <coffeemadness> i need the updatecontent() function to change somehow
[14:07:25] <Omar-> I dont knwo if it's possible with draggable widget
[14:07:36] <coffeemadness> yea, it only changes from 1 to 2 when you clikc on them
[14:07:39] <Omar-> or check their offset() / possition()
[14:08:19] <coffeemadness> so if the firs timage is in the back, and then you click on another image that gets put on top, but then when you click on a third it messes with the first image again
[14:08:46] <coffeemadness> it doesent cycle between enough z-indexes
[14:09:24] <Omar-> coffeemadness because you give all divs z-index 1 and for dragged 2
[14:09:56] <coffeemadness> can i give the image being dragged a random z-index ?
[14:09:59] <Omar-> element will then behave based on their hierarchy in DOM
[14:10:23] <Omar-> last image comes over previous sibling
[14:10:40] <coffeemadness> actually, it would probably be better to have a button switching between 1-10 zindexes
[14:10:49] <Omar-> coffeemadness you can give it any z-index
[14:11:03] <Omar-> I have another idea
[14:11:39] <Omar-> though, i dont know if it's possible
[14:11:51] <coffeemadness> anythings better then what i can do
[14:12:08] <Omar-> if you drag an image over another one, can you determine the "other img"?
[14:12:30] <coffeemadness> im not sure what you mean
[14:12:32] <Omar-> if yes, you then can change the dragged image position in DOM
[14:12:38] <Omar-> hmmmm
[14:12:43] <Omar-> i'll rephrase myself
[14:13:18] <Omar-> I'm dragging imgX over imgY, can retrieve imgY DOM element?
[14:16:24] <coffeemadness> i dont know, complete beginner to jquery
[14:17:00] <Omar-> coffeemadness i'm reading docs
[14:17:10] <coffeemadness> alright
[14:17:38] <doug_> Omar-: jquery ui has drag and drop
[14:17:45] <Omar-> There's a way to get closest element by their position, too much work I assume
[14:18:13] <coffeemadness> hm
[14:18:16] <doug_> Omar-: you'd get the 'dropover' and 'dropout' event when the user drags a draggable over a droppable
[14:18:17] <Omar-> doug_ yea, but can get the dropped over element?
[14:18:33] <doug_> Omar-: yes
[14:18:35] <Omar-> doug_ there's no droppable in the example
[14:18:47] <Omar-> unless you make all draggable droppable
[14:18:58] <doug_> they are, so
[14:19:01] <Omar-> i mean in coffeemadness example
[14:19:18] <Omar-> then i'll leave coffeemadness to you doug_ ;)
[14:19:28] <doug_> oh wrong guy, sorry
[14:19:30] <coffeemadness> i wanted to make the user be able to pile the gold stuff into nice piles
[14:19:37] <Omar-> lol doug_
[14:19:41] <Omar-> coffeemadness http://stackoverflow.com/a/3258322/1771795
[14:20:06] <doug_> coffeemadness: http://jqueryui.com/draggable/  http://jqueryui.com/droppable/
[14:20:38] <coffeemadness> thats where i got the draggble from the start
[14:21:04] <doug_> if you want to get events when you drag over something, make that something droppable
[14:22:09] <coffeemadness> i dont really want event, i just wanna be able to switch the div between layers, so i can decide what goes in front of what image
[14:22:10] <doug_> the droppable will emit dropover dropout and drop events
[14:22:47] <doug_> coffeemadness: you dont want an event. you want to poll?
[14:23:39] <doug_> or you wanted magic? take your pick :D
[14:23:44] <coffeemadness> i want an onclick thing so that when i click on an image i can decide if it goes behind or infront of another image
[14:25:05] <coffeemadness> but what i want and what i can actually do is 2 different thing, since im a complete beginner
[14:25:19] <doug_> coffeemadness: here's a pretty good drag and drop thing I implemented a while ago http://danielnikolovski.com/sites/fifa/
[14:25:41] <doug_> drag onto that thing at the bottom too
[14:25:53] <coffeemadness> thats pretty cool, would not work with what im doing tho
[14:26:16] <Omar-> coffeemadness doug_ i meant something like this, but not working as it should http://jsfiddle.net/Palestinian/do3g4z78/1/
[14:26:53] <coffeemadness> best would be something like this http://clintbellanger.net/articles/treasure/
[14:27:05] <coffeemadness> but i cant do anything with my pitiful coding skills
[14:27:47] <Omar-> coffeemadness you have to try over and over, otherwise you wont learn
[14:28:03] <coffeemadness> oh i am learning, but its not even been a week for me yet
[14:28:13] <doug_> coffeemadness: you want to be able to just change the order of the things?
[14:28:20] <coffeemadness> yeah
[14:28:25] <doug_> there's an easier way
[14:28:28] <Omar-> coffeemadness i'm not a programmer/developer, I do it for fun. yet I've learned alot just by "trial and error"
[14:28:37] <coffeemadness> one coin layer 1, second coin layer 2 etc
[14:28:46] <doug_> coffeemadness: http://jqueryui.com/sortable/
[14:28:57] <coffeemadness> just so the user can make a pretty pile of gold
[14:29:21] <doug_> coffeemadness: you want to pile them up?
[14:29:30] <coffeemadness> yeah i wanna pile stuff
[14:29:43] <Omar-> good luck
[14:29:45] <Omar-> gtg
[14:29:47] <Omar-> bye!
[14:30:05] <coffeemadness> in a unorginized way
[14:30:11] <doug_> to make something on top you don't NEED z-index. simply putting the topmost item later in the list of element is all you need
[14:30:26] <doug_> later elements are implicitly on top of earlier elements, even without zindex'
[14:30:36] <coffeemadness> yeah but what if someone want the crown infront of something?
[14:30:48] <coffeemadness> and ive put it at a certain zindex
[14:31:06] <coffeemadness> thats why i need the zindex to be custumized by teh user
[14:32:18] <coffeemadness> maybe i can use selectble jquery ui
[14:33:07] <coffeemadness> seems too complicated for me
[14:35:40] <doug_> I wouldn't even attempt to implement that with zindex. to put an  element on top, move the element to later in the dom. then all you care about is the one element they dragged, and you don't have to dig through all the other ones
[14:36:08] <coffeemadness> maybe i can make this work somehow
[14:36:09] <coffeemadness> http://jsfiddle.net/LQ4JT/7/
[14:41:41] <doug_> coffeemadness: http://jsfiddle.net/LQ4JT/1031/

[14:46:27] <doug_> coffeemadness: hold on...
[14:46:51] <coffeemadness> no worries im not going anywhere, really glad ur trying to help me
[14:48:03] <coffeemadness> that new fiddle u sent is confusing me a littlebit tho
[14:54:09] <blinky_> Hi all, Could someone please tell me how to pass the variable 'recall' into the 'recall.php' so it is used in the sql statement variable 'recall' - http://pastebin.com/GFKFpM9F
[14:56:55] <doug_> coffeemadness: it doesn't quite work - still an issue with the zindex of the drag helper
[14:57:13] <coffeemadness> this seems to work quite well tho
[14:57:13] <coffeemadness> http://jsfiddle.net/LQ4JT/1032/
[14:57:18] <doug_> coffeemadness: it wouldn't be jquery ui if it worked first try :D
[14:57:32] <coffeemadness> it will be hard to get stuff in the background tho
[14:58:20] <coffeemadness> thanks anyway
[14:58:27] <coffeemadness> this will be anough for now

[15:24:01] <Robdgreat> I was trying to figure out where in the world it was friday evening
[15:24:06] <robertmaxrees> hahaha

[15:24:31] <Robdgreat> as it's still Friday morning in NZ
[15:24:44] <robertmaxrees> the eve of friday is thursday though.  that was the whole point.
[15:25:42] <tinkiete> im trying to create a box carrousel dont know how to move the boxes
[15:26:10] <robertmaxrees> look to see how other carousels do it.
[15:26:39] <tinkiete> have tried to increment the offset but it doesnt keep the right distance
[15:58:09] <torbjorn> I have a checkbox button, that when I click it I want something to happen, but the problem is that its state doesn't change (to active) till after my click handler is done
[15:58:16] <torbjorn> could I have it complete its normal event, and then do stuff?
[15:58:25] <robertmaxrees> bind to "change" instead.
[15:58:39] <robertmaxrees> and the state changes before the handler runs.
[15:59:44] <torbjorn> hm this is a button group, should i bind to the input deepest in?
[16:00:35] <torbjorn> oh this is twitter bootstrap, should perhaps ask there instead
[16:00:57] <__joshua__> meh
[16:01:03] <__joshua__> why not just try it
[16:01:12] <torbjorn> I did, tried on the label and on the input
[16:01:34] <__joshua__> well, the label wont work
[16:01:43] <__joshua__> and dont use click
[16:01:58] <__joshua__> you are interested in change, i presume
[16:02:17] <torbjorn> the only thing that seems to change, is that the label adds the "active" class
[16:02:44] <__joshua__> why do you care about active?
[16:03:08] <__joshua__> also, is this active class a bootstrap thing?
[16:03:16] <torbjorn> oh I don't. I was just checking what happened to the html when I clicked
[16:03:22] <torbjorn> I would suspect so
[16:03:44] <__joshua__> so what exactly would you like to achieve?
[16:04:14] <torbjorn> run code after a checkbox-button is clicked, that gets to see what state the button is in after the click has 'resolved'
[16:04:39] <__joshua__> you want to listen for checkbox changes?
[16:04:42] <doug_> torbjorn: a long time ago robertmaxrees told you to listen to the change event
[16:04:47] <__joshua__> forget clicks
[16:05:01] <torbjorn> doug_: oh im not talking about the click event, im talking about the click of a mouse.
[16:05:14] <__joshua__> what if they use the enter key?
[16:05:24] <__joshua__> don't listen to clicks for checkboxes
[16:05:50] <torbjorn> im happy listening to anything that makes it work
[16:06:02] <__joshua__> if you are interested in the checkbox changing its state, then listen for change events
[16:06:08] <doug_> torbjorn: then listen for 'change'. are you trolling?
[16:06:17] <__joshua__> i suspect so
[16:06:20] <torbjorn> doug_: i tried, didnt help
[16:06:24] <torbjorn> seriously
[16:06:36] <torbjorn> this _is_ a twitter bootsrtap thing, i said so up there.
[16:06:50] <torbjorn> the toggle button consists of a label tag and an input checkbox tag, judging from the html
[16:06:55] <torbjorn> (and some text)
[16:07:25] <torbjorn> when I move my pointer to what looks like a button (but isnt in the markup), and click, the button-like-element sinks in mimiking a button being toggled
[16:07:37] <doug_> twitter bootstrap is a lot of css, and some half-assed js code to go with it
[16:08:04] <doug_> half-assed because most things dont allow you to dynamically change anything significant
[16:08:12] <__joshua__> oh, are you using buttons?
[16:08:46] <torbjorn> not <button>'s as such, the twitter-bootstrap representation of the button seems to contain a label tag and an input checkbox tag
[16:08:50] <boombadaroomba> im trying to add another function to an already existing function. had no luck in #javascript. Anyone care to lend a hand on a simple syntax issue? http://jsfiddle.net/kec93m9f/
[16:10:39] <__joshua__> torbjorn: http://jsfiddle.net/__joshua__/upyxo9tz/1/
[16:11:07] <__joshua__> but without actually knowing what elements you are using i can only guess
[16:11:14] <opie-x> boombadaroomba: you're crazy
[16:11:36] <boombadaroomba> opie-x: yeah, and I'm new to jquery and what not
[16:11:39] <opie-x> likely don't want to setup event handlers in a function
[16:12:10] <boombadaroomba> opie-x: should i just copy pasta the function that does what I want into the function?
[16:12:27] <boombadaroomba> because i tried it and still no luck.
[16:12:27] <doug_> boombadaroomba: that isn't even close to valid. what is your intent?
[16:12:44] <doug_> boombadaroomba: make an object with a 'show' member that has that function?
[16:12:50] <boombadaroomba> well i cut out the things it does because the issue isnt there
[16:13:16] <boombadaroomba> edit: function() { exists i didnt put it in there though
[16:13:38] <boombadaroomba> its basic syntax of how i should go about including things. Do I not DRY my code?
[16:13:44] <doug_> boombadaroomba: ok, you want to block clicks there, block mousedown and mouseup too, using 'mousedown mouseup click' instead of 'click'
[16:14:13] <torbjorn> __joshua__: yeah, thanks, but it doesn't replicate here, attr checked is always undefined, its certainly due to how bootstrap sets this up
[16:14:31] <boombadaroomba> doug_: nah, i have a zoom on hover function that works on all the pages except that one
[16:14:34] <torbjorn> if i look at the html in firebug, the only thing that happens is that the label tag gets an active class
[16:15:01] <__joshua__> torbjorn: if you could get an example, or even just dump the html i might be able to tell you ansser
[16:15:09] <doug_> boombadaroomba: ah, now I see why yu didn't get help in #javascript
[16:15:21] <boombadaroomba> i also cut out what the show function does. i just need to know how to include it
[16:15:27] <boombadaroomba> doug_: that was super helpful. keep it up
[16:16:18] <boombadaroomba> doug_: keeping that negative developer stereotype alive
[16:16:26] <robertmaxrees> what's going on here?
[16:16:41] <opie-x> boombadaroomba: http://jsfiddle.net/kec93m9f/4/
[16:18:01] <boombadaroomba> opie-x: thanks! I see where i went wrong with the syntax. It works now.
[16:18:29] <opie-x> sure, that's basically a really simple way to build objects in javascript
[16:19:16] <torbjorn> __joshua__: its essentially what you see here: http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#buttons under "Checkbox", half a page down, the three blue buttons
[16:19:20] <opie-x> there are better ways to organize larger pages, but stuff like that helps keep state and behavior grouped together
[16:20:03] <boombadaroomba> opie-x: yeah, it was a comma error and where i put it inside the function. thanks man. I really appreciate it
[16:20:41] <opie-x> cheers
[16:21:46] <doug_> boombadaroomba: this way is better http://jsfiddle.net/kec93m9f/5/
[16:22:14] <__joshua__> torbjorn: reproduced your problem, one moment http://jsfiddle.net/__joshua__/DTcHh/1481/
[16:22:20] <doug_> better if you really need to create instances of thing
[16:22:22] <doug_> s
[16:22:44] <doug_> because it shares the functions across the instances
[16:22:49] <torbjorn> nice
[16:23:57] <doug_> there are several ways to do it in javascript
[16:24:36] <torbjorn> I will be able to read the old state of the button if I intercept the click, could just invert that
[16:25:32] <__joshua__> yeah, but thats kinda dumb
[16:25:35] <torbjorn> indeed
[16:26:08] <__joshua__> you mean like this, http://jsfiddle.net/__joshua__/DTcHh/1482/ right?
[16:26:12] <__joshua__> lemme check bootstrap source
[16:26:32] <boombadaroomba> doug_: thanks for being helpful! I'm really new to programming. Hard to google things you dont know what to google.
[16:27:13] <torbjorn> yeah. problem is I gather data from all clicked buttons , so I'd have to give the particularly clicked (or changed) label special treatment
[16:27:17] <torbjorn> which is dumb and ugly
[16:27:24] <boombadaroomba> when you dont know what to google* sorry long day
[16:28:44] <boombadaroomba> but yeah, thanks doug_ and opie-x. I'm going to book it home and read some more books.
[16:30:50] <__joshua__> torbjorn:  yeah i don't like this http://jsfiddle.net/__joshua__/DTcHh/1485/
[16:31:41] <__joshua__> torbjorn: other people have this issue too https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/issues/2380
[16:32:01] <__joshua__> its because its delegated from body, so its the last handler executed
[16:33:07] <torbjorn> yeah interesting thread
[16:33:52] <__joshua__> im afraid the 'best' solution is probably the inversion
[16:50:22] <kevireilly> Does anyone know what the default context is for methods? IE: $('element', context); // thought it was window.document
[16:51:31] <kevireilly> I've got the strangest thing that I'm surely causing somehow where an $('element', context); is being returned while inheriting from my own method's prototype instead of that of window.document or jquery
[16:51:59] <kevireilly> attempted to reproduce in a jsfiddle, of course I can't, so now I'm fishing :)
[16:53:05] <kevireilly> even though it doesn't demonstrate the issue, it at least provides some insight http://jsfiddle.net/re68ua6u/
[16:56:22] <__joshua__> is it window unless you "use strict":
[16:57:02] <__joshua__> oh, you mean context for a dom look up
[16:57:32] <__joshua__> are you using backbone?
[16:58:14] <kevireillly> __joshua__: nopers (i may have missed any other message before the use strict note)
[17:04:16] <tinkiete_> robertmaxrees: i have found it
[17:24:13] <Tomashe> hey guys , anyone knows anything similar to mobiselect
[17:24:28] <Tomashe> mobiscroll*
[17:39:15] <vladh__> Guys, I’m using $.post with .always(), and it’s either returning a jqXHR object (on failure), or the JSON object it received (on success). What’s up with this? Can’t I just make it always return the JSON object?
[17:41:35] <__joshua__> well, if it fails there is no json
[17:41:47] <__joshua__> $.post(blah).done(function(json){});
[17:42:29] <vladh__> __joshua__: I’m sending a 400 with an error message as JSON
[17:42:45] <__joshua__> oh right
[17:43:04] <__joshua__>  .fail()?
[17:44:16] <vladh__> I’ll probably just do separate done() and fail() callbacks, since there isn’t really a way around it apparently, the signature is: jqXHR.always(function( data|jqXHR, textStatus, jqXHR|errorThrown ) { });
[17:44:18] <__joshua__> hmmm, yeah always will have different args depending on status (yes, this is stupid)
[17:44:35] <vladh__> oh well, that sucks. thanks for your help though!
[17:46:25] <randomdrake> join #javascript

[18:07:18] <Tomashe> hey guys , there is a way to open a selectbox using jquery?
[18:16:16] <sammych> drawing library using canvas and is touch friendly? ie11 compat
[18:16:49] <sammych> obviously free, but doesn't need many features, maybe just erase, and line tool
[18:27:03] <amh345> i  i have an "add to cart" button.  when it's clicked i would like to change the .html to "Adding" and hold that for 2 seconds. then i want to change it to "added" for another second and then i want to put it back to the original "add to cart" text.  i've set a time out that can change the text once. but I'm wondering how i would have it work with 2 steps.
[18:28:51] <amh345> perhaps i should just do 2 setTimeouts.
[18:28:57] <amh345> separately
[18:36:06] <kevireilly> __joshua__: lulz I figured it out. Like usual in these scenarios, my own stupidity. The element reference was being re-defined in a different routine using the wrong reference.
[18:41:08] <Jon31> hey guys.. looking for a full background slideshow that can also play vimeo videos. i could use bigvideojs.. but it doesn't really have a slideshow functionality.. it requires extra coding
[20:20:59] <rina> how does one dynamically change the left property of something
[20:22:04] <Jon31> is it possible to change a property not dynamically??
[20:22:44] <rina> yes
[20:22:48] <rina> by hard coding it
[20:38:43] <sammych> rina: element.style.left // $().css('left', <value>); <value> :: number | <valid css dimension<
[20:39:39] <rina> my value has to be dynamic for the left property to do what I need it to do
[20:43:35] <fatmandown> hey, I have multiple buttons with the same class, and when they are clicked I want to get the ID of the button that was clicked. Is this possible? I'm having trouble w/ it, buttonid keeps coming up undefined.
[20:44:33] <Unopoo> can `$()` get html's hided element?
[20:45:58] <Unopoo> I did a console.log($("textarea#item1").length)), it logged 0, I'm pretty sure textarea#item1 it's in the document, but hided
[20:53:35] <Unopoo> forget it , found a typo
[20:54:58] <amh345> I've got some objects stored in a cookie.   when the page is refreshed the first thing that happens is it checks whats in that cookie and i populate a list based on what is in the cookie.   but i notice when i .each through the cookie - the data isn't always retrieve/populated in the order that the objects are in.   is there a way to force a .each to use the order that the objects are in?   here's a small paste bin of the code. http://pastebin.com/tuLhi
[21:29:37] <tiblock> Hi. I need to make draggable zoomable object. So when mouse over object and i scroll it must zoom but place on what mouse is must not move. Where i can read about "algorithm" to make that?
[22:15:55] <sammych> tiblock: write the logic out on a bit of paper. If you have an image starting at (x, y), and there was a single user scrollwheel event, which changes the size of the image by Z pixels in X-dim and Z * aspect ratio for the Y-dim. The image would, if staying put, now be at (x - Z/2, y - Z*AR/2)
[22:16:20] <sammych> you'd just resize the image and change top/left of the element
[23:59:58] <Macaveli> Hi all
