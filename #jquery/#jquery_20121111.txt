[00:25:32] <aqeel> hi room
[00:25:58] <aqeel> how to make on() work with when keyboard enter is pressed
[00:58:48] <danmichel> Before I LazyLoaded my slider, it had a slide effect, now the images just sort of show up, but once all three images have been shown, it has a 'fadein' effect. Thanks in advance for any help http://varmag.com/
[01:03:30] <treeprogram> I have a jquery function, in this form: $("#location_select").click(function() { ...;  and it works fine, but when I add another jquery function after it, e.g. $("#location2_select").click(function() { ...;  it stops working. Any idea on how I can get two .click functions to work?
[01:27:21] <aqeel> are two forms seperate and have their own id
[01:28:23] <aqeel> it should work unless you have something in common that is causing the issue
[01:30:05] <aqeel> if one works then se the common stuff u have in the second that is causing the issue
[01:31:14] <aqeel> any jsfiddle

[02:29:09] <jrockjiggz> hi, if I have a form with radio buttons name="somethingUnique", how can i submit them with the name as 'network' with ajax?

[03:08:18] <jrockjiggz> i have multiple forms with different radio groups with unique name="".. on the server side I want to pass the name as 'network', i'm trying todo this with an ajax call.. but i'm not sure how to do this

[03:18:22] <shn^> Hi guys. I'm getting "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected token ILLEGAL" suddenly from a file I haven't even touched and I can't seem to backtrace the origin of this issue and therefore can't manage to solve it. Was wondering if any of you could take a look at it.
[03:19:17] <shn^> It's a hush hush project so I rather not post a link to the dev site in public
[03:21:14] <dblosevn> hey hahowd you break it?
[03:21:35] <dblosevn> *howd you break it lol
[03:22:07] <dblosevn> sounds like it could possibly be an encoding issue bad char in the file
[03:23:34] <danmichel> you mean like this? http://pastebin.com/qdgXqpM8
[03:23:46] <danmichel> sorry, i didn't see who highlighted me
[03:24:44] <dblosevn> shn^: thats the first thing I would look for
[03:24:45] <aqeel> $("body").on("click","#buttonOK", function() {customload(); loadrepo();$("body").addClass("clicked");});.......................body is not recieving the added class
[03:25:16] <aqeel> what i might be doing wrong?
[03:25:50] <dblosevn> maybe be an error in one of the functions before the addClass call
[03:25:58] <dblosevn> move that first and see if it works
[03:26:09] <dblosevn> addClass customload...
[03:26:21] <aqeel> let me try that
[03:26:33] <dblosevn> if it does go through the other functions and see where the error is
[03:27:42] <aqeel> nope not working
[03:28:38] <dblosevn> weird theres nothing wrong with that command
[03:28:39] <aqeel> on is being on dynamically created element and after the click is done i would like to add the class to the body
[03:29:09] <dblosevn> any errors in console?
[03:29:16] <aqeel> nope
[03:29:21] <dblosevn> besides the remote ones
[03:29:44] <aqeel> no error but it more of seems logical error
[03:30:00] <dblosevn> i dont see a logical error in that statement
[03:30:04] <shn^> Mind if I query you dblosevn? :)
[03:37:13] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/uvcYV/
[03:37:20] <aqeel> i never get to the alert
[03:44:23] <dblosevn> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/uvcYV/1/ that adds the class but does not throw an alert as the code that tests for the class has already completed before the click
[03:47:14] <dblosevn> aqeel: http://jsfiddle.net/uvcYV/2/ there that ones more visual
[03:47:58] <aqeel> thanks...
[03:54:11] <aqeel> but that is on same level how to atatch it from low level to higher level...
[03:54:40] <aqeel> #button ok is dynamically created and clicking that must add the class to page it was called into
[03:55:23] <danmichel> Im not sure who suggested that i try 'no conflict' but it didn't work
[03:56:03] <dblosevn> thats not how you would bind that
[03:56:11] <dblosevn> the second arg for on is callback
[03:57:07] <dblosevn> why are you trying to detect clicks on the body anyways?
[04:00:26] <dblosevn> danmichel: what you got?
[04:04:33] <danmichel> Before I LazyLoaded my slider, it had a slide effect, now the images just sort of show up, but once all three images have been shown, it has a 'fadein' effect. Thanks in advance for any help http://varmag.com/ dblosevn . i tried 'no conflict on my test site and it doesn't seem to work http://theplural.com/ http://d.pr/i/Be7W
[04:04:58] <danmichel>  http://pastebin.com/qdgXqpM8 dblosevn
[04:06:53] <dblosevn> danmichel: ya seems only the first slide works
[04:07:29] <danmichel> Any ideas on how to fix the slide effect dblosevn?
[04:07:45] <dblosevn> im looking at it
[04:08:58] <dblosevn> hmm
[04:09:08] <dblosevn> it worked for me my 4th time around
[04:09:18] <dblosevn> chrome-latest
[04:09:33] <dblosevn> that one chick is hot
[04:09:56] <dblosevn> making me think the images might just be taking that long to load
[04:10:40] <dblosevn> ya it slides and fades for me now
[04:11:12] <dblosevn> so maybe need to look into preloading the images
[04:17:19] <danmichel> preloading instead of lazy loading dblosevn? would that mean that the images don't load until the page is done loading? if so, can you please recommend a link for me?
[04:17:50] <dblosevn> im trying to think of a way to do it that doesnt block the page load
[04:17:57] <dblosevn> the imaes are a little heavy
[04:18:00] <dblosevn> *images
[04:18:02] <danmichel> dblosevn: ideally, id like to just load the first image and have the 2nd and third load after the page has loaded
[04:18:31] <danmichel> dblosevn: the images are very small http://www.webpagetest.org/result/121111_JW_66V/
[04:18:44] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/uvcYV/
[04:18:50] <dblosevn> the problem your having is that... the images havent loaded yet and the slider slides
[04:19:22] <dblosevn> once the images are cahed it works great
[04:19:48] <dblosevn> at least in chrome i havent ried other browsers
[04:19:51] <dblosevn> so maybe
[04:20:12] <dblosevn> dont initalize the slider until the lazyload callback
[04:21:25] <danmichel> yes, correct. the only reason i want to do this(or maybe 2 reasons) is because before i lazy loaded, the 2nd and third images would appear below the first image for a split second on page load. all three images would load at the same time. this slider and my site is responsive, so it isn't like i could give the slider div a height display block them overflow hidden
[04:21:35] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/EuXXA/1/
[04:21:47] <danmichel> second reason is when i do lazy load, the site loads like 2 seconds faster
[04:22:34] <danmichel> dblosevn: how would i do what you are suggesting?
[04:22:37] <dblosevn> the images showing up below the first image is an easy fix
[04:22:46] <dblosevn> simple css
[04:23:05] <danmichel> cool cool. how would i "dont initalize the slider until the lazyload callback"?
[04:23:08] <dblosevn> set a width and height to the slider wrapper and overflow: none
[04:23:17] <dblosevn> *hidden
[04:23:28] <danmichel> i cant set a width and height dblosevn. my site is responsive
[04:23:34] <dblosevn> i gotta look at the lazyload api never used it
[04:23:46] <dblosevn> so you stretch the images?
[04:27:34] <aqeel> i would like to simple make a case of if else based on if mouse click else keyboard key
[04:28:15] <dblosevn> sortof
[04:28:31] <dblosevn> ya i see it now, the images are strectched horizonally
[04:28:44] <dblosevn> well one of them
[04:28:49] <dblosevn> my res is super high though
[04:29:14] <dblosevn> you could lazy load
[04:29:22] <dblosevn> i just have to look at the api
[04:30:29] <dblosevn> nevermind you cant use that
[04:30:42] <dblosevn> i didnt understand what it did until i read the docs
[04:31:03] <dblosevn> it waits too long to pull the image
[04:31:09] <dblosevn> so heres what you do
[04:33:51] <dblosevn> add an id to the main image wrapper , then add a class to the other 2 images wrapper
[04:34:40] <dblosevn> add css for the class and .classname { display:none; }
[04:35:30] <dblosevn> that will prevent the display issue on load how it was flashing the other 2 images
[04:36:31] <dblosevn> attach a load listener to '#mainwrapper img' and in the callback preload the other 2 images
[04:36:46] <dblosevn> once preloaded init the slider
[04:37:05] <dblosevn> and remove the class from the 2 wrappers
[04:39:00] <dblosevn> that solution will one, make it so your still only loading the main image before domready, 2 not init the slider before the images are downloaded
[04:39:30] <dblosevn> and 3 solve the problem of the other images flahsing on page load
[04:41:24] <aqeel> dblosevn can u help me out
[04:41:48] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/EuXXA/1/
[04:42:25] <dblosevn> $("body").on("click","#buttonOK", function() {customload(); loadrepo();});    this is wrong
[04:42:38] <dblosevn> I removed that '#buttonOK' once
[04:42:51] <aqeel> no it is not wroing
[04:43:00] <dblosevn> well it doesnt fire with it
[04:43:02] <aqeel> i can show you...
[04:44:32] <aqeel> did you read the comments i wrote there
[04:44:40] <dblosevn> I guess I dont get why your not doing $('#buttonOK').click(function () { addClass... } );
[04:45:24] <aqeel> forget the class....
[04:45:55] <aqeel> i just need to stop the keydown event if click was occured
[04:46:04] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[04:46:09] <aqeel> click the explosion...
[04:46:48] <aqeel> 1st case, clcik with keyboard enter and try again.....it works as intented fires once.....because of one()
[04:47:13] <dblosevn> http://jsfiddle.net/EuXXA/2/
[04:47:36] <aqeel> 2nd case try clicking with mouse and now if you press enter again after mouse click it fires again and stops.......i do not want the enter again if mouse was clicked
[04:51:09] <aqeel> wowo thankssssssssssssssssss
[04:51:25] <aqeel> dblosevn that works like a charm
[04:51:55] <dblosevn> or this http://jsfiddle.net/EuXXA/4/
[04:51:58] <aqeel> i just cant thanks you enough...
[04:52:04] <dblosevn> removing the listener altogether
[04:52:12] <dblosevn> *listners
[04:52:57] <aqeel> might i sugggest why not use on or off...instead of bind and unbind
[04:53:30] <dblosevn> preference
[04:53:53] <aqeel> so can u make use of on and off with this code of yours
[04:53:57] <dblosevn> i like bind and unbind because its clear what its doing even if it is a couple more keys
[04:54:17] <aqeel> i like it too but soon it will be deprecated...
[04:54:51] <aqeel> which one would you recommend of the two....first or second one
[04:55:21] <dblosevn> docs dont say so you got inside info?
[04:55:41] <dblosevn> first one is really fine
[04:56:35] <dblosevn> off and on do different things then bind and unbind
[04:56:42] <aqeel> http://www.andismith.com/blog/2011/11/on-and-off/
[04:56:56] <dblosevn> off just disables the handlers unbind removes them
[04:57:16] <dblosevn> which is kind of nice in some cases as you can turn them back `on`
[04:58:10] <aqeel> off can remove too...
[04:58:18] <aqeel> just needs more coding
[04:58:48] <dblosevn> never mind read it wrong
[04:59:19] <dblosevn> off removes i thought I saw an example where they toggled the listners off and on but it was the otherway around
[04:59:42] <dblosevn> anyways im gonna go meet this asian chick :-)
[04:59:49] <aqeel> cool
[04:59:54] <aqeel> have nice time
[05:00:06] <aqeel> wish you best of times
[05:00:24] <aqeel> ;)

[07:36:19] <black_warlock> hi peeps
[07:36:31] <Snake1131> Hello.
[07:36:45] <black_warlock> how to trasform string into an int number ?
[07:37:06] <black_warlock> parseInt its not working
[07:37:28] <black_warlock> i have string that is number where i have to add a number
[07:37:36] <black_warlock> previtSplit[2]+1
[07:38:08] <black_warlock> this is returning 10 and 1
[08:06:37] <garbagecollectio> can someone anyalze my code and tell me if its good
[08:06:40] <garbagecollectio> and how i can improve
[08:08:36] <AngryAsian> code plox
[08:29:04] <emery-c> Can someone help me, i have 7 "Auto Complete" boxes but only the first one works. Can someone help? http://pastebin.com/zHajR4Nn  includes index.php and 1 supporting .php the rest are exactly the same exept making diffrent querys
[08:33:26] <AngryAsian> well firstly you dont need 20 $(document).ready(function(){}); things. you just need one
[08:33:36] <AngryAsian> so you can move all the code into one document ready function.
[08:34:02] <AngryAsian> secondly, I couldn't find much about this autocomplete plugin on the web
[08:34:33] <AngryAsian> thirdly I am assuming that all those .php files exist and do something.
[08:35:43] <emery-c> Ok thanks
[08:35:49] <emery-c> and i can find the tutorial url for you
[08:35:51] <emery-c> just a sec
[08:36:34] <emery-c> http://tutsforweb.blogspot.ca/2012/05/auto-complete-text-box-with-php-jquery.html
[08:37:22] <garbagecollectio> can someone tell me why my hash keeps coming back undefined
[08:37:27] <garbagecollectio> its not making a hash
[08:37:38] <garbagecollectio> var datamodel = {};
[08:37:47] <garbagecollectio> datamodel[_id++] = {'trackname':trackname, 'albumname':albumname,'artistname': artistname };
[08:38:01] <emery-c> @ angryasian  updated http://pastebin.com/F8XP7Bkn
[08:38:27] <emery-c> now none of them work
[08:39:18] <emery-c> sorry
[08:39:22] <emery-c> the top one works
[08:39:27] <emery-c> but the rest still dont
[08:39:53] <rindolf> Hi all.
[08:50:15] <AngryAsian> well emery-c you are doing it all wrong, re-read the tutorial.
[08:50:50] <AngryAsian> also from a design perspective. you don't autocomplete an entire form. Your data base is going to guess peoples names and email addresses and phone numbers? I think not.
[08:51:58] <AngryAsian> The best you can do is add 'autocomplete="on"' to all your input elements like this: <input type="email" name="email" autocomplete="on" /> and let the browser do its thing.
[08:52:52] <AngryAsian> also when you copy pasted. you didnt actually add a '}' at the end of each autocomplete statement.
[08:53:12] <AngryAsian> learn a bit of javascript and jquery, don't just copy paste and expect things to work.
[08:54:18] <AngryAsian> database one word. I fail. poop.
[08:57:03] <Henrymb67> Morning
[08:59:10] <Henrymb67> Anybody active here?
[08:59:28] <AngryAsian> hello
[09:00:56] <Henrymb67> @AngryAsian Willing to take a look on what I'm working on? http://54ip.localtunnel.com/projectNotecard/versions/V0.3/
[09:02:11] <AngryAsian> I'm staring at it.
[09:02:24] <Henrymb67> Try typing in it
[09:02:54] <Henrymb67> Hm something is wrong 1 second
[09:04:21] <AngryAsian> make it update only after you press space
[09:04:30] <AngryAsian> also two people typing into one box is brutal
[09:04:32] <AngryAsian> as you can see.
[09:05:23] <Henrymb67> The problem is request a finishes after request b and messes everything up when you type
[09:05:24] <AngryAsian> the problem is that you run an ajax update every couple of seconds. That needs to NOT happen, if you are already typing in the box / It needs to alert you that the text has changed.
[09:06:25] <Henrymb67> I think the issue would persist even if it was updated on every space
[09:07:12] <Henrymb67> Mind taking a look at the jquery?
[09:07:54] <AngryAsian> yep. so you gegt data from the server every 1.5 seconds. And you update everytime a key is pressed.
[09:08:20] <AngryAsian> you need to re-design this thing. too many things are going to happen between every 1.5seconds and everytime you press a character
[09:08:41] <AngryAsian> Also your server will explode
[09:09:30] <Henrymb67> Any recommendations on the path I should take?
[09:10:45] <AngryAsian> well what is the task you are trying to achieve?
[09:10:56] <AngryAsian> the purpose of this multi-user textbox.
[09:12:13] <Henrymb67> Just attempting to make a collaborative text area, that will run on basic shared hosting
[09:12:33] <ajpiano> Henrymb67: look into Operational Transforms and other existing opensource real time collaborative editors
[09:12:50] <Henrymb67> etherpad.org
[09:13:04] <AngryAsian> Honestly, just put an update button. And a status message that says that the text has changed.
[09:13:10] <Henrymb67> mobwrite <- outdated and I can't get it to work.
[09:13:51] <AngryAsian> http://beta.etherpad.org/
[09:13:58] <Henrymb67> AngryAsian: I need it to be realtime collaborative.
[09:14:20] <AngryAsian> alright lets compare your stuff to this: http://beta.etherpad.org/p/jquery
[09:14:48] <Henrymb67> ahahah yah much much better
[09:15:53] <AngryAsian> yeah this etherpad is cool. lol
[09:21:58] <AngryAsian> yeah just switch hosts to someone that gives you ssh access on a shared webserver and you are set.
[09:38:11] <garbagecollectio> can someone review my javascript code and tell me if it looks godo
[09:39:24] <dylang> var el = $('.something'). el.parent().parent().html('test'); <- el still exists but it's not in the DOM anymore. what's the correct way to test for this?
[09:41:42] <garbagecollectio> dylang
[09:41:59] <garbagecollectio> it does not exist then
[09:43:49] <dylang> garbagecollectio: i would think so to, but it does. I can still do el.html() and get back it's html, and el.parent().parent() == []
[09:43:57] <garbagecollectio> can you tell me
[09:44:19] <garbagecollectio> does anyone use the new keyowrd within an already instanatiated object
[09:44:40] <rindolf> garbagecollectio: hi.
[09:44:45] <rindolf> garbagecollectio: where is your JS code?
[09:44:51] <garbagecollectio> rindolf
[09:45:07] <garbagecollectio> i am using a module pattern
[09:45:07] <garbagecollectio> to return objects
[09:45:16] <garbagecollectio> within an object instantiated using the new keyword
[09:45:30] <garbagecollectio> i am wondeirng if this is a good approach
[09:45:31] <rindolf> garbagecollectio: but where is the code?
[09:45:42] <garbagecollectio> or should i be instantiating the objects within the
[09:45:52] <garbagecollectio> the instantiated object
[09:45:59] <garbagecollectio> so you have new main()
[09:46:15] <garbagecollectio> i will show you

[09:49:47] <aqeel> hi room
[09:51:16] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/qHsAP/
[09:51:20] <dns-away> possible to hlp meeeee
[09:51:49] <aqeel> how can i warp this so that window.load can be detected and stop the spinner
[09:52:06] <aqeel> dns-away your question
[09:52:17] <dns-away> Yes
[09:52:29] <dns-away> I should set target="_TOP on inframe
[09:52:39] <dns-away> i have page where load iframe (iframe content) is $('#page').load('index/php');
[09:52:44] <aqeel> i would like to know the load when object is populated
[09:53:09] <aqeel> ok...what is your question
[09:53:19] <rindolf> garbagecollectio: there's a problem seeing that jsfiddle page in Firefox Aurora - I don't see all the scrollbar of the JS part.
[09:53:35] <dns-away> how to insert target_top for all links loaded on $('#page').load('index/php');
[09:53:43] <garbagecollectio> rindolf, use chrome
[09:54:02] <rindolf> garbagecollectio: OK, let me try.
[09:54:12] <dns-away> bad coding
[09:54:48] <rindolf> garbagecollectio: you should split your code into more paragraphs.
[09:54:58] <garbagecollectio> what do you mean
[09:55:13] <garbagecollectio> i mean its pretty split
[09:57:24] <rindolf> garbagecollectio: empty lines between adjacent code lines.
[09:57:35] <garbagecollectio> ok
[09:57:48] <garbagecollectio> rindolf im wondering if this is the proper way to do this
[09:57:58] <rindolf> garbagecollectio:  var td = document.createElement('td'); ==> why aren't you using jQ for all that?

[10:03:15] <min|dvir|us> dns-away: just keep it all in one line and people won't even notice.
[10:04:29] <dns-away> stupid question, but me lazy to think
[10:05:56] <aqeel> window.open('','_top',function(){$('#page').load('index/php');})

[10:08:55] <aqeel> need help is asking questions ;)
[10:08:56] <dns-away> thanks
[10:09:38] <aqeel> min how about my question
[10:09:53] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: type 'min' and press tab.
[10:09:57] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: I don't see a question.
[10:10:04] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/qHsAP/
[10:10:35] <aqeel> how can i wrap the objet into load() such that window.load() can be watched and spinner is hidden
[10:11:18] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: I don't see any spinner. In fact, the preview pane shows nothing.
[10:11:37] <aqeel> jailbreak.webege.com
[10:11:41] <aqeel> click the explosion
[10:12:03] <min|dvir|us> "USE OTHER BROWSERS"
[10:12:05] <min|dvir|us> Really?
[10:12:33] <aqeel> sorry chrome and opera are giving headaches will sort it out later
[10:12:41] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: don't ever do that.
[10:12:55] <aqeel> agreed but it is a huge cached issue
[10:13:30] <aqeel> with opera and chrome .....the javascript does not fire, unless browser is closed and reopen again
[10:13:45] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: I can't help you with your site.
[10:13:51] <aqeel> chrome having some glitches...
[10:14:06] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: the first thing you need to do is to make your JS console squeaky clean.
[10:14:09] <min|dvir|us> No errors.
[10:14:19] <aqeel> it is not i am not supporting it , i will fix all issues later
[10:14:46] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: having a list of browsers that are supported is an absolutely terrible idea.
[10:15:02] <aqeel> i WANT to support all
[10:15:22] <aqeel> i am indeed working on it too
[10:15:27] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: but you lock browsers out intentionally that are not in a list, even if they possibly render the content correctly.
[10:15:43] <aqeel> not intentionally
[10:15:55] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: the browser-sniffing code is garbage. Delete it.
[10:16:05] <aqeel> javascript is not working propely so i might make some other changes for those browsers
[10:16:17] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: nope, sorry.
[10:16:20] <aqeel> there is no browser sniffing code
[10:18:52] <aqeel> i have read and reread on their faq as well the latesat version of opera is still very buggy ...
[10:19:21] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: nobody cares. HTML is HTML. JS is JS. CSS is CSS. But browsers change.
[10:19:22] <dns-away> more one help
[10:19:22] <aqeel> even after pressing ctrl+f5 or shift +f5 no effect
[10:19:40] <dns-away> how call a[href[ link.
[10:19:51] <min|dvir|us> dns-away: rephrase your question.
[10:19:52] <dns-away> $(a[href]).hide
[10:20:01] <dns-away> i want ^this
[10:20:11] <min|dvir|us> dns-away: $('a[href]').hide();
[10:20:16] <dns-away> ty
[10:20:29] <min|dvir|us> dns-away: selectors are always strings.
[10:21:02] <aqeel> agree browsers change but must follow the basics at least
[10:21:02] <dns-away> alright
[10:21:28] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: exactly. Take out the browser sniffing code.
[10:21:51] <aqeel> after refreshing the page does not load the chnged content, do you consider it to be good browser
[10:22:16] <aqeel> where you have to close your browser window and reopen to see the changes
[10:22:28] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: it's your website, not the browser.
[10:22:38] <min|dvir|us> And even if it was the browser, *who cares*?
[10:22:50] <aqeel> ok...i comment the line and you can see for your self
[10:23:04] <min|dvir|us> Once they fix the issue, users of that browser won't be able to see the webpage.
[10:23:23] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: you are sending the web back to the stone age with your browser sniffing code.
[10:23:31] <min|dvir|us> Nobody wants it. It's not adding any value whatsoever. Just removing it.
[10:23:53] <aqeel> i do not want it to be there either
[10:23:57] <min|dvir|us> Then remove it.
[10:24:08] <aqeel> but it left me with no choice as of this moment
[10:24:29] <aqeel> it will be removed and replaced...
[10:24:34] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: one day when you grow up you'll understand.
[10:24:42] <dns-away> this is not $('a[href]')
[10:25:00] <dns-away> correct
[10:25:02] <aqeel> [href] is your code in html
[10:25:18] <min|dvir|us> dns-away: a[href] selects all a elements with a href attribute.
[10:25:35] <min|dvir|us> So $('a[href]').hide() will hide all links.
[10:25:47] <dns-away> how to choice my href
[10:26:04] <dns-away> href='/test' = not hide
[10:26:06] <min|dvir|us> $('a[href="http://google.com"]').hide();
[10:26:08] <aqeel> do u have href= something?
[10:26:27] <dns-away> ok
[10:27:08] <dns-away> that work thanks
[10:28:05] <aqeel> min|dvir|us: what is your browser and os
[10:28:40] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: the web is platform-agnostic.
[10:29:32] <aqeel> because i tested on windows 7 64 bit opera and chrome, after a heavy testing i reached for that conclusion, where i will code for them the last
[10:29:45] <min|dvir|us> You don't "code for them", aqeel.
[10:29:51] <min|dvir|us> You code HTML, JS, and CSS.
[10:29:57] <min|dvir|us> You test on browsers.
[10:30:27] <min|dvir|us> And no matter how many browsers and OSes you test on, there will ALWAYS be another browser and OS you haven't tried.
[10:30:31] <aqeel> exactly and it is the interpretation from those browsers that are not working as intended
[10:30:38] <min|dvir|us> So filtering by OS and browser is a WASTE OF TIME.
[10:31:00] <min|dvir|us> Makes your site very unprofessional.
[10:31:20] <aqeel> agreed but i will remove it and recode for those browsers
[10:31:32] <min|dvir|us> Again, aqeel, you don't code for browsers.
[10:31:43] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: you are particularly arrogant. I don't think I want to help you anymore.
[10:31:52] <aqeel> how will you go if the browser does not even refresh on ajax?
[10:34:27] <aqeel> http://my.opera.com/community/forums/topic.dml?id=1202252
[10:34:34] <aqeel> no i am not and i can never be
[10:34:55] <aqeel> i just want to get it crosss browser too
[10:36:11] <aqeel> min|dvir|us:  you reading the link
[10:43:18] <garbagecollectio> can someone tell me if my javascript code is good
[10:43:42] <aqeel> now are all those people arrogant, who are facing same issue as me
[10:44:28] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: let's see.
[10:44:34] <garbagecollectio> its javascript
[10:44:48] <aqeel> give it a shot
[10:44:58] <garbagecollectio> http://jsfiddle.net/YbpWE/
[10:45:01] <aqeel> garbagecollectio: jsfiddle
[10:45:06] <garbagecollectio> basically i just wnt to know if im sturctuing it
[10:45:07] <garbagecollectio> right
[10:45:08] <garbagecollectio> and if
[10:45:14] <garbagecollectio> memory concerns are addressed etc
[10:45:41] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: I have a feeling this isn't for homework, or a company.
[10:45:43] <min|dvir|us> Am I right?
[10:46:01] <garbagecollectio> huh?
[10:46:17] <garbagecollectio> this is for a playlist builder
[10:46:21] <garbagecollectio> but im also learning
[10:46:28] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: you are writing this for a purpose. Is that purpose to keep a job, or get a good grade?
[10:46:34] <garbagecollectio> no
[10:46:38] <garbagecollectio> im trying to improve
[10:46:42] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: why aren't you using jQuery?
[10:46:48] <garbagecollectio> cause it doesnt scale
[10:47:00] <aqeel> huh???
[10:47:05] <min|dvir|us> That's an interesting point. What are you doing that requires scaling?
[10:47:17] <aqeel> jquery is javascript in shorthand
[10:47:27] <garbagecollectio> im not going to get into what i am doing
[10:47:36] <garbagecollectio> i would be happy to if u can proof the code
[10:47:36] <aqeel> and more in usage than just javascript
[10:47:48] <livingstn> Anyone have any recommendation for a simple plugin that will just scroll a bunch of inline images from right to left continuously?
[10:47:49] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: I am, and these are my comments.
[10:47:58] <garbagecollectio> use jquery?
[10:47:59] <garbagecollectio> lol
[10:48:00] <aqeel> but why is there */   **/ in first two lines
[10:48:14] <aqeel> *\   **\ ssorry
[10:48:15] <garbagecollectio> so whats bad commenting
[10:48:17] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: yes. Your code can be written using 1/5 the amount of lines.
[10:48:36] <garbagecollectio> mindvirus, are u refering to the spacing?
[10:48:39] <min|dvir|us> jQuery has near-universal usage among professionals.
[10:48:46] <min|dvir|us> That is for a particular reason.
[10:49:26] <garbagecollectio> no it doesnt though
[10:49:32] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: and you know how?
[10:49:34] <garbagecollectio> most major companies with high traffic sites
[10:49:42] <min|dvir|us> Like Google?
[10:49:42] <garbagecollectio> cause ive seen these places
[10:49:45] <garbagecollectio> google
[10:49:46] <garbagecollectio> is one
[10:49:48] <garbagecollectio> squarespace
[10:49:49] <garbagecollectio> spotify
[10:49:52] <garbagecollectio> comcast
[10:49:58] <garbagecollectio> sailthru
[10:50:01] <min|dvir|us> What about them?
[10:50:02] <aqeel> a
[10:50:11] <garbagecollectio> they refuse to use jquery on their public facing websites or applications
[10:50:17] <bnb_dev> Hello All!
[10:50:20] <aqeel> ...../*     */ this is how you comment
[10:50:25] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: [citation needed]
[10:50:58] <snover> javascript libraries are not popularity contests, kindly find another topic
[10:51:08] <ezioa> is there anyway to select an n level parent of .class
[10:51:27] <bnb_dev> when i include the jquery ui file, SyntaxError: syntax error <!DOCTYPE html> comes
[10:51:28] <min|dvir|us> snover: buddy, please. This is #jquery.
[10:51:28] <aqeel> yes
[10:51:31] <garbagecollectio> ive seen their infrastrutures
[10:52:41] <aqeel> $(document).on('.class');................class could be burrieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed deep
[10:52:45] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: I can speak from a first-hand perspective that most companies use jQuery.
[10:53:00] <aqeel> it will bubble to top document parent
[10:53:05] <min|dvir|us> Having been an employee at multiple companies, I can tell you that jQuery has been used in each, and for good reason.
[10:53:15] <garbagecollectio> mindvirus, what companies?
[10:53:22] <garbagecollectio> little tiny dev shops?
[10:53:30] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: and where do you work?
[10:53:30] <garbagecollectio> or multi billion dollar companies that need scaling
[10:53:39] <garbagecollectio> some place u have heard of
[10:53:54] <min|dvir|us> Mhm. Which one?
[10:54:07] <aqeel> min|dvir|us: seems to argue with everyone here today
[10:54:20] <eighty4> garbagecollectio: Just stop arguing with him. He's a troll… No need to feed him.
[10:54:31] <garbagecollectio> im not a troll at all, wtf
[10:54:36] <min|dvir|us> He's calling me a troll.
[10:54:40] <garbagecollectio> no im not
[10:54:46] <garbagecollectio> im telling u what i know
[10:54:47] <min|dvir|us> ...?
[10:54:48] <aqeel> garbagecollectio: read carefully
[10:54:59] <garbagecollectio> im telling u guys what i know and have experienced and ur saying im a troll
[10:55:08] <garbagecollectio> cause i am questioning what ur conceptions are of jquery
[10:55:12] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: look, using straight JS, and asking for comments in fucking #jquery is only going to get you this.
[10:55:16] <garbagecollectio> its very unscientific, not to mention un computerish
[10:55:19] <min|dvir|us> eighty4: stay out of this.
[10:55:29] <garbagecollectio> i would go into javascript i cant ge tin
[10:55:30] <aqeel> <eighty4> garbagecollectio: Just stop arguing with him. He's a troll… No need to feed him.
[10:55:54] <snover> garbagecollectio: the solution to “i can’t join channel x” is not to ask a question about x in unrelated channel y
[10:55:55] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: /msg nickserv register <email> <password>
[10:56:02] <eighty4> garbagecollectio: I wasn't calling you a troll. I was calling min|dvir|us a troll.
[10:56:09] <min|dvir|us> At least I'm helpful.
[10:56:21] <garbagecollectio> if you were real jquery ppl javascript would be fair game
[10:56:35] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: go register your nickname and get out of here.
[10:56:35] <grafi> oO
[10:56:38] <swartzcr> I'm having a problem with .keydown where if I have a few keys depressed it doesn't trigger events when more are
[10:56:43] <garbagecollectio> lol
[10:57:26] <aqeel> swartzcr: i got that solved in my case
[10:57:32] <aqeel> what is your issue
[10:57:35] <min|dvir|us> eighty4: don't call me a troll. I'm not a troll.
[10:57:53] <min|dvir|us> I was completely right arguing what I was arguing.
[10:57:56] <aqeel> stop and lets help and behelped
[10:58:21] <swartzcr> aqeel: I can show you my code (5ish lines) if you want, otherwise I don't know how better to describe it
[10:58:25] <grafi> yeah any kind of discussion is highly discouraged :P
[10:58:35] <min|dvir|us> grafi: what's your question?
[10:58:53] <aqeel> u can use jsfiddle
[10:58:59] <garbagecollectio> ok last question
[10:59:04] <aqeel> link given in top row of this chat window
[10:59:13] <grafi> dont have a question, know all the answers ;)
[11:00:41] <eighty4> min|dvir|us: not trolling? right... Then please provide the huge companies that you've worked for that all use jQuery.
[11:00:45] <freenoob> hey babe
[11:00:48] <min|dvir|us> eighty4: I never said huge.
[11:00:48] <freenoob> hey people*
[11:00:53] <min|dvir|us> I have worked for Transparensee and Offerpop.
[11:00:54] <freenoob> i need a quick pointer
[11:00:56] <min|dvir|us> http://min.dvir.us
[11:01:10] <min|dvir|us> Not that I feel any reason why I should answer to you, eighty4.
[11:01:13] <freenoob> i want to make something that's kinda like those browser text editors where you write live on the page itself
[11:01:22] <freenoob> as if the entire viewport were a huge textarea
[11:01:27] <freenoob> where should i start looking?
[11:01:40] <min|dvir|us> eighty4: #web is a joke.
[11:02:07] <rindolf> freenoob: there are rich text widgets.
[11:02:14] <rindolf> freenoob: see FCKEditor for example.
[11:02:31] <rindolf> freenoob: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CKEditor
[11:03:10] <aqeel> swartzcr: jsfiddle?
[11:03:15] <garbagecollectio> can i fucking get private members of parent class
[11:03:19] <garbagecollectio> in javascirpt?
[11:03:27] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: no such thing as private members in JS.
[11:03:35] <garbagecollectio> private variables
[11:03:36] <min|dvir|us> You can have variables within closures, which is private.
[11:03:42] <swartzcr> aqeel: I'm there, what... exactly should I be doing
[11:03:44] <min|dvir|us> No, you can't access variables that are not in scope.
[11:03:46] <garbagecollectio> yeah so say i subclass
[11:03:57] <garbagecollectio> can i get the parent class privates?
[11:03:59] <aqeel> type your 5 line of code you were saying
[11:04:01] <garbagecollectio> by jut tying the varaible?
[11:04:07] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: no.
[11:04:12] <min|dvir|us> JS is function-scoped./
[11:04:18] <garbagecollectio> but i can get the private kethods?
[11:04:24] <garbagecollectio> by just typing the function?
[11:04:25] <swartzcr> aqeel: done, how do i share it?
[11:04:28] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: if they're attached to this, then sure.
[11:04:32] <aqeel> click run
[11:04:36] <garbagecollectio> but thats public
[11:04:38] <aqeel> then click save
[11:04:45] <garbagecollectio> i think ur mistaken,a subclass should be able to access private functions
[11:04:47] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: no way to access any private vars.
[11:04:49] <freenoob> rindolf: thanks. though i'm looking for something like this http://www.ytbryan.com/writer/
[11:04:50] <aqeel> then u will have click share
[11:04:55] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: OK, then I'm mistaken. Good luck out there!
[11:04:56] <swartzcr> http://jsfiddle.net/ahhHX/
[11:05:22] <grafi> isnt that what protected does?
[11:05:34] <min|dvir|us> There is no protected keyword in JS. This isn't fucking Java.
[11:06:03] <garbagecollectio> yeah but they are de facto protected
[11:06:04] <garbagecollectio> i think
[11:06:09] <garbagecollectio> what is the point then of subclassing
[11:06:15] <garbagecollectio> if its all public methods abaiable
[11:06:25] <grafi> what is the point of forcing oop onto js ^^
[11:06:39] <min|dvir|us> Wow, this is like a cesspool of willing ignorance.
[11:07:23] <garbagecollectio> ??
[11:07:25] <garbagecollectio> love to hear
[11:07:53] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: the point of OO has absolutely nothing to do with hiding information.
[11:08:07] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: the point of OO is to structure code in a way more easily understandable for humans.
[11:08:40] <garbagecollectio> if i use this
[11:08:43] <garbagecollectio> this keyword
[11:08:47] <garbagecollectio> its accessible to the entire outside world
[11:08:54] <aqeel> swartzcr:  what do u want to do
[11:08:54] <garbagecollectio> not just the subclass
[11:08:57] <garbagecollectio> and the parent class
[11:08:58] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: no, it changes for each scope.
[11:08:59] <garbagecollectio> but anyone can call it
[11:09:04] <garbagecollectio> that doesnt make any sense
[11:09:05] <min|dvir|us> this is a special keyword.
[11:09:21] <swartzcr> aqeel: try holding down 5 keys and then pressing another, notice that it won't change the letter
[11:09:22] <min|dvir|us> 'this' and 'arguments' are two special keywords.
[11:09:25] <garbagecollectio> mindvirus can u look at my  code
[11:09:26] <min|dvir|us> They are implicitly passed to each function.
[11:09:32] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: I looked at it.
[11:09:58] <garbagecollectio> dude if i use this
[11:09:59] <min|dvir|us> swartzcr: probably related to your keyboard.
[11:10:04] <garbagecollectio> that means i could edit it
[11:10:10] <garbagecollectio> from outside the subclass
[11:10:10] <min|dvir|us> Most keyboards can't send more than 2-3 keys at once.
[11:10:36] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: not sure what you're saying. Write a minimal JSfiddle to say what you're saying.
[11:10:44] <min|dvir|us> And use jQuery for god's sake, if you're not a masochist.
[11:12:33] <aqeel> well it is not the keyboard but the way you are doing it
[11:13:04] <swartzcr> do tell
[11:13:25] <aqeel> if you have 5 or more keys pressed and not have any detection in code as to what is happeneing.....this happens
[11:13:44] <jrajav> No, he's right, most keyboards physically cannot send more than a handful of codes at one time
[11:14:04] <jrajav> Sending an arbitrary number at once is a feature advertised by a lot of gaming keyboards
[11:14:24] <swartzcr> so what aqeel is saying is wrong, there is no way to fix this?
[11:14:26] <jrajav> Nothing you can do in software will change that
[11:14:34] <min|dvir|us> swartzcr: I don't see your problem.
[11:14:43] <min|dvir|us> swartzcr: Seems to work fine for me. Always shows the most recent character.
[11:14:58] <swartzcr> just tested it on a mac and it worked, on my thinkpad it doesn't
[11:15:09] <aqeel> there is
[11:15:15] <min|dvir|us> swartzcr: means your Thinkpad has a cheap USB/PS2 interface.
[11:15:22] <min|dvir|us> Whereas your Mac has a more powerful interface.
[11:16:27] <aqeel> use if there is more than one keydown ignore all previous keypress and take into account the last keypress
[11:16:56] <garbagecollectio> fuck
[11:17:07] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: his keyboard literally does not cause certain keydown events.
[11:17:31] <garbagecollectio> my code is not encapsulated enough
[11:17:40] <aqeel> he asked if he presses more than 5 keys together the code does not work
[11:18:08] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: because his keyboard is too busy sending information for the 5 keys that it cannot send information for the 6th key.
[11:18:15] <min|dvir|us> Mine does 8 or 9.
[11:18:56] <aqeel> so it can be hrad coded to take into the length of key pressed and show the last keypress
[11:19:31] <min|dvir|us> aqeel: think a little more deeply about the implications of the keyboard not causing keydown events.
[11:19:38] <aqeel> or simply alert, too many keys pressed
[11:21:11] <adac> how do i get the link (URL) back for this example: <a href="URL">TEXT</a>
[11:22:11] <min|dvir|us> adac: $('#a-selector').attr('href');
[11:22:24] <adac> thanky you min|dvir|us
[11:24:59] <dns-away> Anyone know whether is possible fixes on dropped hard-drive
[11:25:29] <aqeel> it can tolerate some amount of shock else it is damaged
[11:25:50] <min|dvir|us> dns-away: this is not the right channel to ask.
[11:25:54] <aqeel> see if pcb is intact
[11:26:53] <dns-away> dropped from 20 cm and started to creak/
[11:26:55] <dns-away> ok
[11:27:14] <garbagecollectio> mind virus how do i
[11:27:22] <garbagecollectio> inheritet private variables when subvlasisng
[11:27:50] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: there is no such thing as a private variable in JS. Just variables that are out of scope.
[11:27:53] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: type 'min' and press tab.
[11:27:57] <ackpacket> If I specify a callback function for $.post, what will the "this" operator refer to in that function?
[11:28:17] <garbagecollectio> min|dvir|us:
[11:28:37] <min|dvir|us> ackpacket: whatever you pass as context in the options dict.
[11:28:48] <min|dvir|us> (IIRC.)
[11:29:09] <ackpacket> hmm... is there a default?
[11:29:50] <min|dvir|us> ackpacket: see "context" on http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/.
[11:30:01] <min|dvir|us> "By default, the context is an object that represents the ajax settings used in the call ($.ajaxSettings merged with the settings passed to $.ajax)."
[11:30:43] <ackpacket> ok, i think i see a solution here then
[11:31:20] <garbagecollectio> min|dvir|us: what is the point of inheritance if i can't restrict it to a new class
[11:31:29] <garbagecollectio> min|dvir|us: if i use this then its open to anyone too
[11:31:45] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: like I said, OO has absolutely nothing to do with restriction.
[11:31:51] <min|dvir|us> Stop restricting things.
[11:31:56] <garbagecollectio> i need to restrict this shit
[11:32:04] <min|dvir|us> You're fucking crazy.
[11:32:13] <garbagecollectio> you shoud onl have access to the private members and functions
[11:32:17] <garbagecollectio> if u are fucking inherited the class
[11:32:18] <garbagecollectio> thats basic
[11:32:29] * min|dvir|us sighs.
[11:32:34] <min|dvir|us> Java != OO.
[11:35:09] <garbagecollectio> min|dvir|us: how the fuck do i do this
[11:35:38] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: "this"?
[11:36:06] <snover> min|dvir|us: chill out
[11:36:17] <min|dvir|us> snover: nah.
[11:36:42] <garbagecollectio> why is everyone against min|dvir|us
[11:37:02] <min|dvir|us> Nobody's against me. They're jealous.
[11:37:25] <snover> you need to stop insulting people
[11:37:31] <Heather_> how do I remove the strong element here http://jsfiddle.net/9nNMy/3/ ? But I do not want the string inside strong to be removed.
[11:37:42] <min|dvir|us> snover: fine, you're right.
[11:37:53] <min|dvir|us> But people need to listen more. I can't be infinitely patient.
[11:37:55] <snover> at least until i stop paying attention
[11:38:01] <snover> then i guess you can do whatever you want
[11:38:07] <min|dvir|us> I can do that anyway.
[11:39:25] <min|dvir|us> Heather_: var $thingy = $('#someid strong'); $thingy.replaceWith($thingy.contents());
[11:39:46] <min|dvir|us> Heather_: Oh, there's also $('#someid strong').unwrap();
[11:39:59] <Heather_> okay ty
[11:46:06] <garbagecollectio> mindvirus can u review my code
[11:46:10] <garbagecollectio> min|dvir|us:  can u review my code
[11:46:31] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: yes, it uses 5x as many lines as it should.
[11:47:03] <garbagecollectio> why
[11:47:39] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: because it's too scalable.
[11:47:52] <garbagecollectio> min|dvir|us:  can u just look at the actual code please
[11:48:07] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: I swear to you, I did.
[11:48:10] <min|dvir|us> That is my comment.
[11:48:13] <garbagecollectio> dude
[11:48:20] <garbagecollectio> what about the actual mvc and stuff
[11:49:16] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: first thing you'll learn out in the real world is that what they teach you in uni is not always right as far as CS.
[11:49:30] <min|dvir|us> 199/200 CS graduates cannot program.
[11:50:24] <ackpacket> $.post doesn't allow context passing?
[11:50:53] <min|dvir|us> ackpacket: look at the data argument.
[11:50:56] <garbagecollectio> shutup dude this is what is rquired
[11:51:39] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: "required" by you, the almighty requirement creator.
[11:51:50] <min|dvir|us> First step to learning is admitting you don't know everything.
[11:51:51] <garbagecollectio> no to be respected
[11:51:52] <ackpacket> min|dvir|us: What am I looking for in particular?
[11:52:25] <min|dvir|us> ackpacket: the data argument is supposed to be a JS object that you pass in.
[11:52:40] <min|dvir|us> If you want to pass a custom context, add 'context' as a key to the object.
[11:52:42] <adavia> is there any way to make 2 autocomplete fields dependent each other?
[11:52:59] <min|dvir|us> ackpacket: really, a better way to do this is to use fn.bind().
[11:53:17] <jrockjiggz> When submitting a form via ajax, I have multiple radio groups (with unique name=""), but i want to submit the form and pass those fields as name="network".. not sure how todo this..
[11:53:20] <ackpacket> I'm 100% garbagecollectio is trolling...
[11:53:26] <garbagecollectio> im not
[11:53:28] <jrockjiggz> I kind of started the idea... http://jsfiddle.net/awjAu/1/
[11:53:30] <garbagecollectio> why does everyone think that
[11:53:41] <min|dvir|us> ackpacket: also see http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.proxy/
[11:54:19] <min|dvir|us> Everyone, pay attention to jrockjiggz.
[11:54:21] <ackpacket> min|dvir|us: But I thought data is just what is posted to the server?
[11:54:26] <min|dvir|us> That is how you ask a question.
[11:54:30] <snover> garbagecollectio: it could have something to do with the questions you are asking, your refusal to accept answers, and then telling people to shut up
[11:54:32] <ackpacket> min|dvir|us: adding context in there will change the context?
[11:54:43] <garbagecollectio> the questions im asking are legit
[11:54:44] <snover> maybe you want to stop doing those last two parts
[11:54:46] <garbagecollectio> the answers arent good enough
[11:54:55] <garbagecollectio> and mindvirus is trolling me so i told him to shutup
[11:55:02] * min|dvir|us cries
[11:55:46] <min|dvir|us> ackpacket: not sure what you're asking.
[11:55:53] <snover> ?101 @ garbagecollectio
[11:55:54] <bot-t> garbagecollectio, New to JavaScript? You should read this first: http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
[11:56:04] <min|dvir|us> ackpacket: oh, yeah, my mistake.
[11:56:15] <min|dvir|us> ackpacket: use $.ajax instead.
[11:56:21] <ackpacket> garbage, if you think people will upon your rude request go look at your OBSCENELY bloated code, you're either retarded or a troll
[11:56:23] <min|dvir|us> Or look at $.proxy.
[11:56:32] <garbagecollectio> ackpacket, how is it "bloated"
[11:56:44] <min|dvir|us> Don't answer that.
[11:56:45] <snover> ackpacket: be nice!
[11:56:47] <ackpacket> probably in the same way as your ego *mumble*
[11:56:52] <snover> everyone just hug
[11:56:54] <garbagecollectio> it doesnt use juery?
[11:56:56] <garbagecollectio> jquery?
[11:57:02] <min|dvir|us> OOooooooh.
[11:57:04] <garbagecollectio> jquery is not good for scaling, i told yo
[11:57:09] <ackpacket> I rarely use jquery myself
[11:57:12] <snover> garbagecollectio: please go read eloquent javascript
[11:57:20] <garbagecollectio> i already read that book snover
[11:57:21] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: what are you doing that requires scaling?
[11:57:28] <garbagecollectio> 19million customers
[11:57:29] <min|dvir|us> Do you know exactly how fast or slow jQuery is?
[11:57:30] <snover> garbagecollectio: i don’t believe you :)
[11:57:32] <min|dvir|us> Do you have any numbers?
[11:57:36] <garbagecollectio> actually i did
[11:57:37] <min|dvir|us> I do.
[11:57:46] <garbagecollectio> how fast or slow?
[11:57:48] <garbagecollectio> i do
[11:58:05] <snover> garbagecollectio: sounds like you know everything so you don’t need any help then
[11:58:10] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: 400-500% slower than well-written JS.
[11:58:17] <min|dvir|us> But I still use it.
[11:58:26] <garbagecollectio> exactly
[11:58:30] <garbagecollectio> they will leave the page
[11:58:33] <min|dvir|us> Because I'm not writing a freaking brute force algorithm for the browser.
[11:58:35] <garbagecollectio> they will leave the page and not buy hings
[11:58:43] <ackpacket> How much jquery could you really have that the user notices a load time?  Really?
[11:58:51] <min|dvir|us> Exactly.
[11:58:52] <ackpacket> What kind of web app are you writing, a password cracker?
[11:58:58] <garbagecollectio> think extremely large sites
[11:59:02] <min|dvir|us> jQuery is slow, but it is fast enough.
[11:59:08] <min|dvir|us> garbagecollectio: what, like yours?
[11:59:09] <garbagecollectio> u recommend jquery for animation?
[11:59:13] <ackpacket> garbagecollectio: even extremely large sites are divided into pages
[11:59:13] <min|dvir|us> Yes, absolutely.
[11:59:15] <garbagecollectio> for example
[11:59:15] <garbagecollectio> LOL
[11:59:28] <ackpacket> aw
[11:59:31] <ackpacket> =\
[12:00:09] <jrockjiggz> how then to pass form data as a defined name?
[12:00:21] <min|dvir|us> 14:53 < jrockjiggz> When submitting a form via ajax, I have multiple radio groups (with unique name=""), but i want to submit the form and  pass those fields as name="network".. not sure how todo this.. http://jsfiddle.net/awjAu/1/
[12:00:39] <jrockjiggz> data: { definedName: $('input.match').is(':checked').vla() } ?
[12:00:49] <jrockjiggz> that doesn't seem the best way
[12:00:54] <min|dvir|us> jrockjiggz: I would rename in the submit event handler.
[12:01:03] <min|dvir|us> Really I would rename as early as possible.
[12:01:17] <min|dvir|us> Preferrably right in the HTML.
[12:02:40] <jrockjiggz> min|dvir|us: the idea is I multiple forms on a single page, to avoid conflict of the radio options, I use a unique name="radioOptionName".. but I want to use a single form submit even to handle, and the radio options on any given form really should represent 'network'
[12:03:14] <min|dvir|us> jrockjiggz: name= is not a unique attribute.
[12:03:20] <min|dvir|us> Multiple elements can have the same name=.
[12:03:21] <jrockjiggz> unique per form
[12:03:25] <min|dvir|us> No.
[12:03:33] <jrockjiggz> then that solves it :) i'll try it out
[12:05:55] <jrockjiggz> min|dvir|us: it works, thanks
[12:06:22] <min|dvir|us> jrockjiggz: glad to help.
[12:14:00] <piklu> Hi guys
[12:14:06] <piklu> need someone who knows french
[12:14:09] <piklu> anyone there?
[12:14:36] <jrockjiggz> i dont know french
[12:16:44] <jrockjiggz> piklu: but you can ask
[12:16:56] <jrockjiggz> piklu: but this is not the right chan
[12:33:15] <NYCLoki2> hi
[12:33:38] <NYCLoki2> I'm pretty new to programming, but looking to make a simple webapp
[12:33:52] <NYCLoki2> just form fields to store and retrieve stuff from a database
[12:34:04] <NYCLoki2> is there a particular framework that works best with jquery?
[12:35:03] <jrockjiggz> NYCLoki2: jQueryTouch, jQueryMobile, you can build your app with PhoneGap, if you want a good solution check out www.kendoui.com -- but also there are many
[12:35:40] <NYCLoki2> jrockjiggz: it's not an app for a phone though, just a webapp for a browser on a desktop
[12:36:14] <NYCLoki2> also it isnt going to be public, only for internal use for a small organization of 3 people
[12:36:18] <jrockjiggz> Oh, well, then AngularJS :) or similar
[12:36:50] <jrockjiggz> or check out knockoutJs
[12:37:42] <jrockjiggz> You can use those with Twitter Bootstrap
[12:38:03] <NYCLoki2> well, im just looking for something simple, as simple as possible
[12:38:15] <NYCLoki2> also, i'm barely a programmer
[12:38:26] <NYCLoki2> i've made some simple stuff with php, but i'm not great
[12:38:33] <NYCLoki2> which is why i was looking for an easy to use framework
[12:38:48] <NYCLoki2> where i can just kind of call a method to make a form field...if such a thing exists?
[12:39:00] <NYCLoki2> but something that works well to access jquery functionality
[12:40:28] <jrockjiggz> NYCLoki2: i would be suprised to find a framework that doesn't support jquery..
[12:40:49] <jrockjiggz> NYCLoki2: both AngularJS and Knockout are good for what you ask
[12:40:57] <NYCLoki2> oj, ok
[12:41:14] <NYCLoki2> ok looking at them now, thank you :)
[12:41:24] <jrockjiggz> yw
[12:42:29] <NYCLoki2> I thought I would have had to use something with a server side language for the database stuff
[12:42:31] <NYCLoki2> does angular hook in with php or ruby or something?
[12:44:17] <jrockjiggz> NYCLoki2: its a javascript library, so it will run in your browser.. it is normal to pass data using JSON, so any backend framework will provide that.. you can find more ina #angularJS
[12:44:39] <NYCLoki2> ok
[12:45:14] <NYCLoki2> before i go, since you seem knowledgable, could you recommend a good (for a beginner) backend framework? pref php if possible?
[12:48:10] <jrockjiggz> NYCLoki2: sorry i wouldn't be the one to ask ;)
[12:48:31] <NYCLoki2> Can you recommend a channel where that question might be more at place?
[12:53:28] <blommer> NYCLoki2: #django
[12:53:59] <blommer> NYCLoki2: #rubyonrails
[12:54:00] <blommer> Oops
[12:54:09] <blommer> Sorry you said php
[12:54:44] <NYCLoki2> i know there a bunch i just wasnt sure which was easiest for a novicr
[12:55:56] <blommer> NYCLoki2: the only PHP framework I've used was CodeIgniter, but there are a bunch of others
[12:56:12] <blommer> I know very little about it or PHP though
[12:58:13] <BillCriswell> If you have a start color and an end color how would you go about calculating all the colors needed in between depending on the amount of colors you need?
[12:58:55] <Asterokid> I dont know about jquery
[12:59:15] <otherj> hey guys, is there a simpler/more elegant way to write this? I'm thinking there must be. https://gist.github.com/cc211ceeefba1a004e9f
[12:59:27] <Asterokid> but I would blend the HUE, SAT, VALUE from one color to another
[12:59:37] <jrockjiggz> BillCriswell: Colors are generated RGB R:0-255, G:0-255, B:0-255 , if your color is red, and your going to green, you would increase G 255 times, then decrease R 255 times, this is the order of transition
[12:59:53] <Asterokid> or blend the rgb values yeah
[13:00:55] <Asterokid> Does anyone know if there is an alternative to jQuery.get() that is natively supported by the DOM?
[13:01:18] <Asterokid> basically a asynchroneous get request
[13:01:50] <jrockjiggz> otherj: looks pretty easy to read its pretty good
[13:02:06] <otherj> yeah? i guess it just seems pretty verbose
[13:02:18] <otherj> not very DRY
[13:02:21] <jrockjiggz> Asterokid: perhaps load() ?
[13:02:37] <BillCriswell> otherj: If I could see what it's doing visually I might be able to help  a bit more haha.
[13:03:04] <otherj> BillCriswell: it's just a sprite image that i'm moving up or down based on the background offset
[13:03:11] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: Ever use the "clear" app on iPhone?
[13:03:12] <otherj> so when you hover it shows the black and white half
[13:03:19] <Asterokid> jrockjiggz: no load function in chrome console
[13:03:26] <jrockjiggz> otherj: maybe http://jsfiddle.net/vMWZH/
[13:04:01] <jrockjiggz> BillCriswell: sorry i have not
[13:04:04] <otherj> jrockjiggz: i don't think that would work on all of them, would it?
[13:04:09] <jrockjiggz> tias
[13:04:31] <jrockjiggz> Asterokid: load() is a jquery function
[13:04:34] <jrockjiggz> ?load @ Asterokid
[13:04:35] <bot-t> Asterokid, .load(handler): Bind an event handler to the "load" JavaScript event. http://api.jquery.com/load-event/
[13:04:40] <otherj> bascially it's 3 divs, and when one hovers on one then the other two should change the background property
[13:05:27] <BillCriswell> jrockjiggz: Trying to figure out how they would handle there themes as some programming exercise.
[13:05:31] <BillCriswell> their*
[13:05:32] <Asterokid> jrockjiggz: I am looking for the non jquery equivalent if you wish.
[13:05:49] <jrockjiggz> otherj: you may want to use CSS transitions.. can you paste your markup in jsfiddle?
[13:06:13] <otherj> sure, moment
[13:06:26] <otherj> (i'm doing this in rails so i need to extract the source)
[13:07:20] <jrockjiggz> Asterokid: you can do it the pure javascript way, but this is why jquery was invented.. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/AJAX/Getting_Started?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=AJAX%3AGetting_Started
[13:07:49] <jrockjiggz> Asterokid: maybe i'm not understanding your objective, as jQuery IS cross-browser compatible
[13:08:26] <otherj> jrockjiggz: not sure i can throw the images up, hope that's ok
[13:08:35] <jrockjiggz> np
[13:09:20] <Asterokid> jrockjiggz: yeah i know... very convenient... just trying to see if i can limit my framework dependencies... but ill probably stick with jquery.. looks like a pain in the #ss otherwise
[13:09:46] <otherj> jrockjiggz: http://jsfiddle.net/hs8jw/
[13:09:54] <otherj> oh, shit
[13:09:57] <otherj> forgot a class
[13:10:11] <otherj> eh, that should give you an idea anyway
[13:11:00] <adavia> is there any way to make 2 autocomplete fields dependent each other?
[13:11:31] <Asterokid> thx jrockjiggz
[13:17:25] <bung> adavia: dependent how? just make sure they're both filled out?
[13:17:37] <bung> or their values match some data set you want?
[13:19:30] <jrockjiggz> otherj: no need for javascript, http://jsfiddle.net/hs8jw/1/
[13:20:23] <otherj> hm
[13:20:39] <otherj> that doesn't work exactly like the js version, but i think i see where you're going with it
[13:20:49] <otherj> although i suspect it doesn't work with ie
[13:21:23] <otherj> hmm
[13:21:37] <otherj> i guess i'll have to play with that to see if i can duplicate and test with ie
[13:21:42] <otherj> it would be great not to load jquery
[13:23:28] <otherj> thanks jrockjiggz
[13:29:25] <bung> jrockjiggz: thats some intense css
[13:29:40] <Devers> anyone here familiar with the jquery animation queue?
[13:30:36] <Devers> and with coffeeescript I guess
[13:31:45] <Devers> figs = $("#figures")
[13:31:45] <Devers> q = null
[13:31:45] <Devers> figs.hover ->
[13:31:45] <Devers>     q = figs.queue("fx")
[13:31:45] <Devers>     figs.clearQueue()
[13:31:47] <Devers> , ->
[13:31:47] <Devers>     figs.queue("fx", q)
[13:31:51] <otherj> hey guy
[13:31:56] <otherj> throw that in a jsfiddle or something
[13:31:57] <jrockjiggz> bung: just some urls make it look messy
[13:32:01] <Devers> kk
[13:34:51] <Devers> can jsfiddle handle coffeescripta/
[13:35:26] <jrockjiggz> Denvers: add a dependancy
[13:36:17] <Devers> ok

[13:44:40] <black_warlock> hi
[13:44:47] <black_warlock> can somebody help me to serialize a string ?
[13:45:58] <bung> jrockjiggz: nah i didnt mind the mess, i didnt know about adding transition to css and i like the clever sibling hover stuf too
[13:59:44] <Almanod> Hello, I have <script type="text/javascript> $('#one').css('display', 'none');  </script>
[13:59:51] <b-ot> No output.
[14:00:14] <Almanod> But it does not hide my <div id="one"></div> Element at all. And I checked and I DO have the jquery library linked.
[14:00:38] <Almanod> It's driving me crazy. What am I missing?
[14:00:56] <coldhead> ?ready @ Almanod
[14:00:56] <bot-t> Almanod, .ready(handler): Specify a function to execute when the DOM is fully loaded. http://api.jquery.com/ready/
[14:03:42] <Almanod> Ah thank you, that worked.
[14:03:57] <Almanod> I saw a code before that did not have that. Are there times where it is an exception?
[14:05:27] <coldhead> Almanod: if your script tags are at the end of the file
[14:05:35] <coldhead> then the rest of the dom will already have loaded
[14:05:41] <coldhead> so it will usually work without ready()
[14:05:57] <coldhead> but it's better to use ready() because then you don't have to worry about where you <script> tags are in the document
[14:06:03] <coldhead> and it won't break if someone moves them
[14:06:09] <black_warlock> can someone help me with this serialization ? http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/T3Xaa/2/
[14:08:10] <Almanod> Ah I see ok thank you much!
[14:08:17] <black_warlock> soz
[14:08:28] <black_warlock> this one http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/T3Xaa/3/   the other one had no rel
[14:09:32] <Devers> ok so I have a question
[14:09:33] <Devers> http://jsfiddle.net/V6tUS/
[14:09:42] <Devers> why does it not always start back up the animations when I hover out
[14:14:35] <Devers> anyone?
[14:14:57] <coldhead> black_warlock: http://jsfiddle.net/T3Xaa/4/
[14:15:13] <coldhead> your selector for the LIs didn't match anything
[14:15:22] <coldhead> and then inside the each you redeclared serialz
[14:15:36] <coldhead> so no new data ever made it out of the loop
[14:16:29] <coldhead> Devers: i always have trouble with queue()
[14:16:38] <coldhead> i would use stop()
[14:16:51] <Devers> unfortunately stop stops the animation mid way
[14:16:55] <Devers> so it makes it pretty jumpy
[14:16:57] <Devers> I think
[14:17:00] <coldhead> stop(true) ?
[14:17:06] <coldhead> ?stop
[14:17:06] <bot-t> .stop([clearQueue], [jumpToEnd]): Stop the currently-running animation on the matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/stop/
[14:17:09] <Devers> ok
[14:17:13] <coldhead> read the docs
[14:17:15] <Devers> do you know how I can restart the queue?
[14:17:17] <Devers> oh I have
[14:17:21] <coldhead> there's some magic combination that works
[14:17:35] <coldhead> guh the best person to ask about queues is in singapore or something
[14:17:37] <coldhead> cc gnarf
[14:17:43] <coldhead> we wish you were here, gnarf
[14:17:52] <gnarf> sup?
[14:18:20] <Devers> oh I'm having issues with animation queues
[14:18:38] <Devers> http://jsfiddle.net/V6tUS/ <- the animation queue doesn't start back up on hover out
[14:18:40] <gnarf> toggle based animation?
[14:19:00] <gnarf> sigh, coffee
[14:19:09] <Devers> I can convert to JS if you want
[14:19:22] <coldhead> gnarf you are my sunshine, my only sunshine
[14:20:01] <gnarf> Devers: what are you trying to do, i got like 10 minutes before i gotta meet up with the team for breakfast :)
[14:20:09] <Devers> oh awesome
[14:20:09] <Devers> um
[14:20:17] <Devers> I'm trying to pause the animation on hover, and resume on hover out
[14:20:22] <Devers> so I thought since I have a lot of chained animations
[14:20:26] <Devers> I would get the queue, save it
[14:20:31] <Devers> clear it
[14:20:37] <Devers> then restart it when I hovered out
[14:20:50] <Devers> but the restarting part is giving me trouble
[14:21:02] <gnarf> so, the "current" animation won't exist in the queue
[14:21:13] <gnarf> do you need to pause that one too?
[14:21:36] <Devers> well that would be ideal but having it finish before I clear the queue works too
[14:21:40] <gnarf> I think what I would do is approach it slightly differently
[14:21:51] <gnarf> have a var that is your "is hovered" state
[14:22:06] <gnarf> then instead of using delay
[14:22:12] <gnarf> use a custom queued function
[14:22:17] <gnarf> lemme mock it up quick
[14:22:21] <Devers> thank you so much
[14:22:22] <coldhead> god bless you gnarf
[14:22:40] <BillCriswell> in gnarf we trust
[14:22:51] <Devers> if I dequeue the animation on hover out
[14:22:58] <Devers> it fires and restarts the queue
[14:23:06] <Devers> but if i don't dequeue first, nothing happens
[14:23:45] <gnarf> how do i switch this fiddle back to JS lol
[14:24:03] <Devers> panels lol
[14:25:20] <Devers> I will be RIGHT back, 1min
[14:27:57] <Devers> ok
[14:27:58] <Devers> back
[14:28:06] <gnarf> Devers: http://jsfiddle.net/gnarf/a38dn/
[14:28:43] <gnarf> best i can come up with in 10 minutes
[14:28:48] <Devers> ok thanks a lot man
[14:28:51] <gnarf> does the approach make sense?
[14:28:51] <Devers> really appreciate it
[14:28:58] <coldhead> thanks so much gnarf <3
[14:29:01] <Devers> I think so
[14:29:16] <coldhead> i can help him out from here, corey. enjoy breakfast!
[14:30:54] <gnarf> need to track the setTimeout call too and cancel it on hover
[14:30:57] <gnarf> or whatev
[14:51:26] <coldhead> a way to drown out the howling in the street
[14:56:36] <adac> alert($('#example').attr('href'))  ... for some reasons this is empty this would be the example: https://gist.github.com/4056609 any ideas?
[14:57:33] <BillCriswell> adac: You probably want $('#example a')
[14:57:50] <BillCriswell> If you had id="example" on the link itself your code would work.
[14:58:14] <adac> BillCriswell, ahh now I isee!
[14:58:17] <adac> thank you!
[14:58:23] <BillCriswell> adac: Welcome.
[15:09:15] <carpii> looking to hire someone for a couple of hours jquery work. anyone inetrested?
[15:10:07] <black_warlock> coldhead tks
[15:11:25] <black_warlock> but why it set 1,1  ?
[15:11:33] <black_warlock> the rel = 1 has not parents
[15:11:55] <black_warlock> should set it undefined or m I wrong ?
[15:13:57] <black_warlock> omg i dont understand what this is doing
[15:16:14] <min|dvir|us> black_warlock: ask your question again.
[15:16:51] <black_warlock> im trying to serialize the order of an UL list
[15:16:52] <coldhead> i was just fixing the bugs that meant NOTHING was happening, the subtle details are a matter for yourself
[15:17:43] <black_warlock> i wish the serialize string report  item1:[its parent] - item2 = [its parent]
[15:18:03] <black_warlock> in order
[15:18:18] <min|dvir|us> black_warlock: instead of using item1 and item2, use item n and n+1.
[15:18:27] <min|dvir|us> Make what you're saying unambiguous.
[15:18:49] <black_warlock> each LI has an id
[15:18:58] <black_warlock> unique id
[15:19:12] <black_warlock> cant be ambigous
[15:19:45] <min|dvir|us> black_warlock: the problem is ambiguous.
[15:19:53] <min|dvir|us> I don't understand what you're saying. Rephrase.
[15:19:59] <black_warlock> http://jsfiddle.net/jonny/T3Xaa/6/
[15:20:16] <black_warlock> it must take everytime something change
[15:20:32] <black_warlock> the entire list with li elements
[15:20:40] <black_warlock> rapresented with their parents
[15:20:54] <black_warlock> in order
[15:21:00] <min|dvir|us> black_warlock: write what you want to say in one brief, unambiguous, succinct sentence.
[15:21:21] <black_warlock> serialize the li positions
[15:21:33] <min|dvir|us> Serialize in what format?
[15:21:38] <black_warlock> serial
[15:21:47] <min|dvir|us> black_warlock: 'serialize' does not mean what you think it means.
[15:21:49] <black_warlock> item:[its parent]
[15:22:00] <min|dvir|us> OK, that makes sense.
[15:22:07] <black_warlock> item:[its parent] , item:[its parent] , item:[its parent], item:[its parent]
[15:22:19] <min|dvir|us> And what about the parentless items?
[15:22:52] <black_warlock> unique id
[15:23:25] <black_warlock> id:[its parent] , id:[its parent] , id:[its parent] , id:[its parent] , id:[its parent] ,
[15:23:38] <black_warlock> hum
[15:23:58] <black_warlock> would be better rapresenting also the order number
[15:24:07] <min|dvir|us> black_warlock: what is the actual problem you're trying to solve?
[15:24:12] <min|dvir|us> That JSfiddle is very artificial.
[15:24:58] <black_warlock> the serializ doesnt rapresent  the serialization id like to obtain
[15:26:09] <black_warlock> why artificial ?
[15:26:15] <black_warlock> its so easy
[15:26:31] <black_warlock> you can drag and drop item
[15:26:59] <black_warlock> inside another li forming a new sublist
[15:27:27] <black_warlock> the concept is to have always the list of all items with their location
[15:27:34] <black_warlock> updated
[15:36:10] <da-beginner> hi.. i am implementing a list view sort on this wine cellar sample app.. and even though the function runs, it is not sorting
[15:36:11] <da-beginner> http://scrypton.com.au/backbone/cellar/desktop/
[15:36:38] <da-beginner> what am i missing here? maybe a view refresh perhaps? i thought this.sort( ) will take care of it?
[15:37:35] <black_warlock> im working just on sortables da-beginner
[15:38:30] <black_warlock> backbone
[15:38:33] <black_warlock> hum dunno
[15:41:26] <black_warlock> and where is the function for the select ?
[15:43:41] <black_warlock> min|dvir|us i solved it
[15:43:47] <subbyyy> you are sorting the collection of objects but not the dom elements?
[15:44:25] <black_warlock> i dont get how he can sort those items if there arent other informations
[15:44:35] <black_warlock> on each element
[15:44:57] <black_warlock> like data
[15:45:08] <black_warlock> or country
[15:45:11] <subbyyy> no wait, it causes a reset so thats why the list gets longer woops lol, but he doesnt clear the items on the list first
[15:45:13] <black_warlock> impossible
[15:45:35] <black_warlock> but where are other informations ?
[15:45:50] <black_warlock> ahhhhhh
[15:45:58] <black_warlock> ok
[15:46:54] <da-beginner> black_warlock: subbyyy: oh yeah you're right
[15:47:08] <da-beginner> i have to do a reset listen on the view and clear?
[15:47:22] <black_warlock> yus
[15:47:37] <da-beginner> but will it clear the whole thing though?
[15:48:07] <da-beginner> just wondering what the order of the execution is
[15:51:08] <black_warlock> now it is ordered by name
[15:52:18] <black_warlock> lol
[15:52:28] <black_warlock> i saved a wine named PiP
[15:52:31] <black_warlock> XD
[15:53:25] <black_warlock> hum
[15:53:31] <black_warlock> you must refresh list also on save
[15:53:35] <black_warlock> it bugs
[15:54:56] <da-beginner> black_warlock: i was doing some modification then
[15:55:00] <da-beginner> black_warlock: try again :)
[15:55:15] <da-beginner> i deleted your PIP
[15:55:31] <black_warlock> but doesnt work the sorting
[15:55:34] <black_warlock> and also
[15:55:46] <black_warlock> if "name" sorting its defult
[15:55:54] <black_warlock> must be already selected on list
[15:56:48] <black_warlock> hum
[15:57:47] <da-beginner> black_warlock: yes, by default it is sorted on name
[15:57:54] <da-beginner> i think all i need to have is to have $(this.el).html(''); on render
[15:58:03] <da-beginner> let me try that now
[15:59:25] <da-beginner> black_warlock: it works now
[15:59:47] <da-beginner> now, the next step.. to make it re-sort when i click "Save" :)
[16:00:42] <carpii> looking to hire someone for a couple of hours jquery work. plz message me for spec if youre interested
[16:01:27] <fukawi2> I have a weird issue. I'm using the input selector to store some query string values into variables; specifically "rid". When "rid=573" it works fine, when "rid=570", jquery returns "undefined". I'm baffled. Any ideas what is going on?
[16:01:47] <carpii> paste some code
[16:02:01] <carpii> into a nopaste site
[16:03:12] <otherj> can you guys point me at a good plugin that does the bigpicture with thumbnails underneath (with horizantal scroll on the thumbnails for those that don't fit under) that enlarges when clicked?
[16:03:16] <otherj> i know there must be a bunch
[16:03:42] <carpii> uhh, this is exactly the job im hiring for.
[16:03:57] <otherj> haha, really?
[16:04:03] <otherj> find me a plugin and i'll do the job for you ;o)
[16:04:25] <carpii> well if i found a plugin I could integrate easily, i wouldnt be hiring :)
[16:04:37] <otherj> you're trying to do what i'm asking about?
[16:04:41] <otherj> did you look at galleria etc?
[16:04:46] <carpii> pretty much yes
[16:05:23] <fukawi2> carpii, http://nopaste.info/8ba62796d7.html
[16:05:24] <carpii> hm nice
[16:05:34] <carpii> whats the reason galleria doesnt work for you?
[16:05:37] <otherj> pikachoose too
[16:05:49] <otherj> it's a little big for what i want to do
[16:05:53] <otherj> too many options
[16:06:02] <otherj> i'm sure i'll end up just writing something
[16:06:39] <carpii> fukawi2: I dont understand your code. Youre passing parameters via GET to a PHP, but then somehow trying to pick them up in javascript from inputs ?
[16:06:46] <carpii> youd need to show the php code too
[16:08:04] <garbagecollectio> can someone look at my javascript mvc code
[16:08:06] <carpii> thx otherj, i like galleria lots, but Im hoping to find a jquery based one. And pikachoose is jQuery, but i dont like it :(
[16:08:13] <fukawi2> carpii, uh oh, I think you've just highlighted dumb mistake #1 for my work week :-/
[16:08:19] <carpii> ;D
[16:08:49] <otherj> carpii: http://www.tripwiremagazine.com/2012/09/jquery-image-slider-plugins.html etc. etc. etc.
[16:08:52] <fukawi2> carpii, sorry, leave it with me for a minute, you've helped me by making me realize that though, thanks
[16:08:59] <carpii> no probs fukawi2
[16:09:01] <carpii> thx otherj
[16:09:21] <otherj> also, i'm pretty sure galleria is jquery
[16:10:05] <carpii> oh, yes i just noticed on that page it says its jquery
[16:10:09] <carpii> awesome
[16:16:20] <fukawi2> carpii, yes, it was a PHP error. my hidden fields were not being written to the page before the PHP barfed, and the jquery ran. my bad, nothing to see here, thx for your time :)
[16:18:49] <carpii> no PROBS :)
[16:18:51] <carpii> oops caps
[16:20:41] <otherj> fukawi2: i'm hope you're not just using $_GET without checking what it's giving you
[16:25:48] <da-beginner> what's the best way to re-render listview upon model.save( )?
[16:28:06] <fukawi2> otherj, it's an internal only system twice removed from public networks, but yes, the PHP does validate it anyway
[16:30:56] <garbagecollectio> bjjb
[16:31:04] <garbagecollectio> can someone tell me my mvc code and tell me if legit
[16:46:20] <zettam> Hello channel
[16:46:37] <zettam> I know this might be a wrong channel to ask but, the rest is soo inactive so I'm trying my chances:
[16:47:07] <zettam> When I right align my text (span), the text inside is not "fully" right aligned. There is always like one "character" emptiness when there is "letter spacing". How can I solve this issue ?
[16:47:39] <otherj> doubt if anyone will answer that without code
[16:48:10] <zettam> I'm talking about css
[16:48:25] <otherj> yes, and?
[16:48:29] <pifantastic> zettam: yes, recreate the problem in a jsfiddle
[16:48:46] <zettam> text-align:right and letter-spacing: 6px;
[16:48:51] <zettam> ok give me a sec, I'll do it
[16:51:23] <zettam> http://jsfiddle.net/zettam/Z3XyP/1/ pifantastic otherj
[16:53:56] <pifantastic> zettam: hmm, yeah, not sure what to do about that
[16:54:17] <carpii> i think its just the nature of the css property
[16:54:55] <garbagecollectio> can somoene review my js code
[16:54:55] <zettam> hmmm
[16:55:03] <zettam> can you guys think of a solution or a workaroudn for that
[16:55:17] <zettam> carpii: pifantastic
[16:55:22] <carpii> why is it an issue specifically?
[16:55:40] <carpii> i mean, youre setting an explicit width on it anyway right?
[16:55:48] <pifantastic> zettam: you could try a negative right margin
[16:55:54] <carpii> i tried that, no good
[16:56:01] <pifantastic> depending on what the context is
[16:56:02] <zettam> pifantastic: oh that may actually work !
[16:56:20] <zettam> Hmm, that's a temporary solution but in my case that may work
[16:56:27] <zettam> I'm still asking for a better solution though
[16:56:34] <zettam> if you guys can think of any, that'd be amazing
[16:56:48] <zettam> like, centering text to the middle of any "button" is impossible with this method
[16:56:58] <zettam> thi method: I mean "letter spacing"
[17:00:37] <black_warlock> da-beginner all right
[17:01:53] <fonko> hey guys, if i go like $(input).focusout(function(){some stuff to do} would this mean that each time an input tag lost its focus that stuff will be performed?
[17:04:11] <jerkface03> Hi, I'm very new to JQuery... I'm trying to target the onclick of a button in a page. The page id is initial-config. The button id is save. Would something like this work $("#initial-config > #save").click(function(e){ .... }
[17:04:12] <jerkface03> ?
[17:04:38] <carpii> fonko kinda, but youd want $("input")
[17:05:16] <carpii> also that will only apply to inputs when the page first loads. Not inputs created by an ajax request (else use .live or whatever its called these days)
[17:05:24] <tjoy> Yet another beginner - what's a good reference for jquery coding style? I don't want to make ugly code.
[17:05:34] <fonko> carpii, thanks!!
[17:05:51] <carpii> use .delegate instead of .live, to apply to dynamically created inputs
[17:05:58] <fonko> ok
[17:06:07] <carpii> actually thats deprecated too heh
[17:06:12] <carpii> use .on :)
[17:06:15] <fonko> by the moment im not using dynamically created inputs... yet
[17:06:23] <fonko> but i will keep that in mind
[17:06:26] <fonko> .on
[17:06:26] <b-ot> fonko, used for many things that shouldn't be memorized
[17:06:27] <fonko> ok
[17:06:28] <fonko> :)
[17:06:52] <fonko> .on
[17:06:52] <b-ot> fonko, used for many things that shouldn't be memorized
[17:06:53] <fonko> lol
[17:07:08] <fonko> .focusout
[17:07:22] <fonko> .focusout()
[17:07:34] <fonko> mm.. i guess b-ot has nothing to say to that
[17:11:00] <garbagecollectio> is it ok to call controller code from the model?
[17:12:47] <coldhead> garbagecollectio: what would happen if you reused the model in another project and dropped the controller?
[17:12:57] <coldhead> good things?
[17:13:11] <garbagecollectio> no but i mean
[17:13:23] <garbagecollectio> i mean i dont know how to evaluate that
[17:13:31] <garbagecollectio> i have an event emitter
[17:13:42] <garbagecollectio> should i be calling the event emitter that then talks to the controller
[17:14:20] <garbagecollectio> ??
[17:14:28] <coldhead> it feels like the event emitter should be talking to the controller
[17:14:39] <coldhead> but it depends on the code
[17:15:03] <coldhead> if the model is is a wrapper for the event emitter then you don't want to drag the controller into it
[17:16:26] <coldhead> anyway what would i know, it's my first day using jQuery
[17:16:43] <coldhead> i thought MVC was a character from harry potter
[17:18:59] <Jagst3r15> can anyone reccomend a simple table sorting script?
[17:19:11] <Jagst3r15> I just have some html tables with data that I need to be able to sort
[17:20:24] <coldhead> Jagst3r15: http://tablesorter.com/docs/ ?
[17:20:55] <Jagst3r15> i saw that, just seeing if there were any others people knew off the top of their heads :)
[17:21:51] <garbagecollectio> coldhead: can u review my code
[17:21:57] <garbagecollectio> jus tell me if it loooks good
[17:21:59] <garbagecollectio> proper design
[17:22:39] <coldhead> there are others like datatables.com Jagst3r15
[17:22:52] <coldhead> but tablesorter is well known and well supported and easy enogh to use
[17:23:10] <garbagecollectio> coldhead
[17:23:11] <garbagecollectio> u ready?
[17:23:23] <coldhead> as ready as i'll ever be
[17:23:38] <coldhead> $(coldhead).ready()
[17:24:17] <macinch88> heheh
[17:26:28] <garbagecollectio> coldhead: http://jsfiddle.net/WLsK4/
[17:26:32] <garbagecollectio> serious shit going on there
[17:26:35] <garbagecollectio> tell me if its valid mvc
[17:30:06] <coldhead> if you were on my team, garbagecollectio
[17:30:08] <coldhead> and you said
[17:30:12] <coldhead> "is this valid MVC"
[17:30:24] <coldhead> i would say "why haven't you used backbone or something"
[17:30:43] <coldhead> i can't see any MVC violations, it looks okay
[17:30:54] <garbagecollectio> nice
[17:30:56] <coldhead> but it's not my favourite thing to read in the world :P
[17:30:58] <garbagecollectio> i know but they want raq js
[17:31:01] <garbagecollectio> why do you say that
[17:31:11] <coldhead> did you see the formatting in the fiddle?
[17:31:25] <coldhead> eye strain
[17:31:37] <coldhead> the important thing here is to ignore me because i know nothing
[17:34:08] <tw2113> he doesn't
[17:34:16] <tw2113> i asked him what 1+1 equaled once, he said 11
[17:34:21] <tw2113> pssh
[17:34:23] <tw2113> n00bs
[17:34:56] <javalover> so I have a custom scrollbar for a div...
[17:35:05] <javalover> but I want to apply it to a text area
[17:36:36] <coldhead> the best thing to do is to talk your clients out of custom scrollbars :(
[17:36:40] <coldhead> they're holding the web back
[17:36:59] <javalover> but it's my website
[17:37:08] <livingstn> Anyone know of a responsive solution that will horizontally scroll images?
[17:37:11] <coldhead> oh well that's easy!
[17:37:12] <tw2113> so the client is easy to contact
[17:37:16] <coldhead> talk yourself out of it, javalover
[17:37:20] <livingstn> I just have a list of images that I want to scroll horizontally in a loop
[17:37:25] <javalover> no I like custom scrollbars
[17:37:30] <javalover> and i just want it on my text area
[17:37:46] <javalover> why should my page be ugly?
[17:37:55] <tw2113> coldhead, have you ever had a woman that you didn't have to initiate via $() ?
[17:38:07] <javalover> lol
[17:38:25] <coldhead> livingstn: http://tympanus.net/Development/Elastislide/
[17:38:31] <javalover> no, some of them he gets via google.com
[17:38:42] <coldhead> please, i am afraid of women
[17:38:53] <coldhead> ANYWAY javalover
[17:39:00] <tjoy> I'm brand new to jquery and ajax - Is there a simple way to set a var to a numeric value retreived from an http request?
[17:39:01] <coldhead> given that you persist in this folly
[17:39:05] <coldhead> what is the problem?
[17:39:21] <coldhead> no tjoy
[17:39:27] <livingstn> coldhead: Is there a way to just have that scroll automatically?
[17:39:35] <coldhead> you're supposed to do all the "work" from your function inside the success handler
[17:39:43] <coldhead> because that's where the data is available
[17:39:51] <tjoy> that's just stupid
[17:39:51] <coldhead> it's not easy to expose that data to other parts of your code
[17:39:55] <coldhead> it's not tjoy
[17:39:57] <coldhead> don't be rude
[17:40:02] <coldhead> that's just how callbacks work
[17:40:08] <coldhead> you'll get used to it
[17:40:19] <coldhead> (it is a bit stupid but it's not JUST stupid)
[17:40:48] <tw2113> livingstn, http://tympanus.net/codrops/2011/09/12/elastislide-responsive-carousel/
[17:40:50] <tw2113> check the options
[17:40:57] <tjoy> fair enough
[17:41:21] <otherj> coldhead, what's the name for that kind of html thing that scrolls horizially to show more options?
[17:41:38] <otherj> just carousel?
[17:41:45] <livingstn> tw2113: Nice Thanks.
[17:41:47] <otherj> that seems to apply to a broader variaty of things
[17:41:47] <javalover> the problem is I didn't write nanoscroll someone else did
[17:41:56] <javalover> and I want to apply the css of it, to a text area
[17:41:57] <coldhead> probably, otherj
[17:42:05] <javalover> i've just never done that...idk how to customize a scrollbar
[17:42:07] <coldhead> ah textarea's are tricky
[17:42:09] <tjoy> is there a hard way to expose data from an ajax request to other parts of the code?
[17:42:27] <javalover> so far i've learned I can make it orange...
[17:42:52] <tw2113> tjoy, you could probably pass in a custom function for the success callback, that you can pass the received data into
[17:43:28] <tw2113> unless i'm wrong
[17:43:41] <javalover> i found this... http://www.christianchown.com/blog/a-custom-jquery-scrollbar-in-a-textarea/
[17:43:48] <coldhead> javalover: i think the easiest solution might be to use a div with contenteditable
[17:44:00] <coldhead> and for older browsers just give them a regular textarea
[17:44:07] <coldhead> and maybe a rude comment in the source
[17:44:45] <coldhead> tjoy: the callback philosophy is you say "hey ajax, get me some data, here is all the code that needs to run once the data is available"
[17:44:53] <coldhead> and that is literally ALL the code
[17:45:08] <livingstn> tw2113: No way to get it to loop. :(
[17:45:19] <tjoy> so munging data from two requests together is hard then?
[17:45:36] <javalover> div with content editable?
[17:45:38] <k1t> hey folks, any idea why the cursor won't change when hovering certain part of the <audio> tag? http://jsfiddle.net/eHDaH/2/
[17:45:42] <javalover> so don't even use a text area?
[17:45:46] <k1t> pretty stumped <,<
[17:45:54] <coldhead> livingstn: http://filamentgroup.com/lab/responsive_carousel/
[17:45:58] <coldhead> the excellent filament group
[17:46:00] <tjoy> i'll just do it server-side, thanks all
[17:46:03] <coldhead> that's got to be baller
[17:46:15] <coldhead> tjoy: you can munge them together!
[17:46:23] <coldhead> using promises/deferreds
[17:46:24] <coldhead> it's good fun
[17:46:29] <coldhead> if you're into that kind of thing
[17:46:32] <coldhead> ?when @ tjoy
[17:46:32] <bot-t> tjoy, jQuery.when(deferreds): Provides a way to execute callback functions based on one or more objects, usually Deferred objects that represent asynchronous events. http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.when/
[17:47:09] <coldhead> javalover: yes, div with contenteditable
[17:47:20] <coldhead> you can still use nanoScroller.js that way
[17:47:46] <javalover> i've never done a contenteditable div before...
[17:47:54] <javalover> didn't know that even existed gonna research
[17:48:05] <coldhead> i promise it will take less time than doing a custom textarea scroller
[17:48:24] <tjoy> yes, well, i want to keep this simple, i'd rather finish this task than learn the intricacies of this week's jquery api
[17:48:35] <coldhead> how rude :P
[17:48:55] <coldhead> jQuery's promise API is from CommonJS
[17:48:58] <coldhead> it's "standard"
[17:49:04] <coldhead> but good luck! whatever works for you, sir
[17:49:24] <tjoy> thank you, and keep writing fantastic jquery so i don't have to :)
[17:49:47] <javalover> yo wtf mate!! http://jsfiddle.net/ThinkingStiff/FcCgA/
[17:50:08] <javalover> is this real?
[17:50:44] <coldhead> looks real to me
[17:51:15] <tw2113> looks as real as unicorns
[17:51:54] <javalover> so how do I get the textarea.val()?
[17:51:57] <javalover> same way?
[17:52:05] <javalover> and why does this work just cuz he put contenteditable
[17:52:09] <javalover> like why is it a text area?
[17:54:21] <tw2113> https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTML/Content_Editable
[17:54:51] <robert_> so RudyValencia and I are working on a project where I have a checkbox, "Use same details from above"; yet, it's not updating.. is there a good way to make it copy the details from one form part to another?
[17:55:45] <javalover> does this only work for html5 enabled browsers?
[17:55:58] <coldhead> yes javalover
[17:56:06] <coldhead> so only like 80% of current browsers
[17:56:31] <coldhead> and it's not a form input so you have to use html() or text() rather than val()
[17:56:48] <javalover> can the user insert their own html?
[17:57:07] <robert_> (specifically: autocomplete boxes don't recieve the value until you click on the box and mess with it for a few seconds)
[17:58:43] <RudyValencia> we're using https://github.com/JamieAppleseed/selectToAutocomplete specifically, for a more elegant autocomplete
[17:58:50] <code_ph0y_> hey guys is there a way to always get tinymce working if any ajax is thrown?
[17:59:40] <Jagst3r15> this looks good right? http://pastie.org/5363332
[17:59:45] <code_ph0y_> anytime ajax or post is used?
[18:00:15] <robert_> code_ph0y_: #tinymce
[18:00:32] <robert_> (I think)
[18:00:38] <coldhead> javalover: they can insert anything that could appear in the source HTML
[18:00:45] <code_ph0y_> thats not a channel lol
[18:00:45] <robert_> oh, sorry.
[18:00:52] <robert_> I just saw that, lol
[18:01:02] <robert_> but they don't use jquery, I don't think.
[18:01:15] <code_ph0y_> yeah they do
[18:02:00] <code_ph0y_> basically all I want is when ajax and post gets used always have three lines of js code to run on the complete
[18:02:31] <code_ph0y_> can I overwride the ajax and post complete function some how?
[18:02:45] <tw2113> they have functions predefined?
[18:04:07] <code_ph0y_> tw2113: ? sorry didn't understand your question?
[18:04:34] <coldhead> ?ajaxComplete @ code_ph0y_
[18:04:34] <bot-t> code_ph0y_, .ajaxComplete(handler): Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete. This is an Ajax Event. http://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/
[18:04:38] <tw2113> when using something like $.ajax() you create a function to use on the success of the call
[18:05:05] <coldhead> he's talking about running code when ANY ajax happens, tw2113
[18:05:08] <coldhead> it's chinatown
[18:05:26] <tw2113> ah
[18:05:28] <code_ph0y_> coldhead: thanks a million!
[18:05:45] <code_ph0y_> thanks to everyone else that tried to help as well :D
[18:06:16] <tw2113> *burps coldhead's name*
[18:13:12] <Jagst3r15> wtf my table id is myTable , I have the tablesorter script fired, but its not working
[18:13:30] <Jagst3r15> and the jquery is http://pastie.org/5363332
[18:13:43] <Jagst3r15> what da hell
[18:13:44] <code_ph0y_> i litterally wanna cry!
[18:13:52] <coldhead> Jagst3r15: can we see the html?
[18:14:12] <code_ph0y_> i wish I asked that question 3 days ago
[18:14:17] <coldhead> code_ph0y_: you okay little buddy?
[18:14:20] <Jagst3r15> yes its just a test site not the final product so dont judge it
[18:14:28] <Jagst3r15> http://jagst3r15.com/scholarships360/table-of-scholarships/
[18:14:35] <coldhead> Jagst3r15: you need thead tags
[18:14:52] <coldhead> and tbody
[18:14:58] <coldhead> oh you have them
[18:15:04] <coldhead> wtf tablesorter
[18:15:13] <tw2113> Jagst3r15, "$ is not a function"
[18:15:22] <Jagst3r15> wat
[18:15:22] <b-ot> i have noticed there are many plugins that sometime i could need
[18:15:37] <code_ph0y_> I have been debugging trying to find ways to get it to work now I have to go back through all the code and clean up lmao
[18:16:17] <code_ph0y_> thanks again ch ... am gonna go now and code through the tears lol
[18:17:02] <tw2113> Jagst3r15, remember jquery works in noConflict
[18:17:17] <Jagst3r15> so i dont need that
[18:17:20] <coldhead> Jagst3r15: your code seems to be here http://jagst3r15.com/scholarships360/wp-content/themes/murmur/js/murmur.js?ver=20120831
[18:17:22] <tw2113> you do
[18:17:24] <rbik> yeah how does that work????
[18:17:26] <coldhead> and doesn't use noConflict
[18:17:29] <tw2113> change this: $(document).ready(function()
[18:17:39] <tw2113> to jQuery(document).ready(function($)
[18:17:42] <coldhead> it works for me when i replace the $ with jQuery
[18:17:57] <coldhead> and then it looks it works but you're missing the tablesorter CSS
[18:18:51] <Jagst3r15> what do you mean coldhead
[18:19:04] <Jagst3r15> i thought u just had to have valid html table markup
[18:19:13] <coldhead> the markup is fine
[18:19:23] <coldhead> your code i linked to uses $ instead of jQuery
[18:19:31] <tw2113> Jagst3r15, do what i said above
[18:19:33] <coldhead> and then you need the CSS to show the little sort icons
[18:19:41] <coldhead> Jagst3r15: do what tw2113 said
[18:19:52] <coldhead> ignore me, i cannot read or write
[18:20:20] <Jagst3r15> k i added this http://pastie.org/5363394 so now i need the css? shouldnt it work without the css
[18:23:21] <coldhead> hmm, why is it nor working
[18:23:24] <coldhead> not*
[18:23:32] <coldhead> i can see classes being added and removed
[18:23:35] <coldhead> but no sorting >: |
[18:24:06] <tw2113> it only works for seasoned jquery people
[18:24:11] <tw2113> your n00bness works against you
[18:24:52] <Jagst3r15> =C
[18:25:06] <coldhead> Jagst3r15: you have HTML in your tables
[18:25:15] <coldhead> so you need to set textExtraction: 'complex'
[18:25:17] <coldhead> like so http://tablesorter.com/docs/example-option-text-extraction.html
[18:25:32] <coldhead> oh ignore that example
[18:25:37] <coldhead> it uses a function
[18:25:50] <coldhead> supposedly just the string 'complex' instead of that function will do
[18:25:55] <coldhead> check the docs that page links to
[18:27:15] <coldhead> good luck Jagst3r15
[18:27:17] <coldhead> godspeed
[18:27:23] <Jagst3r15> thanks lol
[18:32:17] <jerkface03> Are there any helper API calls for adding an item to list in jquery mobile? or should I directly modify the DOM with my <li> items?
[18:33:07] <coldhead> jerkface03: i believe the Right Way is to add to the dom yourself
[18:33:10] <rbik> hey guys I have two jquery files that affect two sepreat files that don't seem to work at the same time.
[18:33:21] <coldhead> and then there's a method you call to notify jQM of the update
[18:33:24] <rbik> I understand the idea of noConflit but not working
[18:33:28] <coldhead> but i can't remember what it's called
[18:33:44] <coldhead> rbik: you are including 2 versions of jQUery?
[18:33:50] <rbik> yeah
[18:34:07] <rbik> http://odinbackyard.x10.mx/2contact.html here is the issue
[18:34:07] <coldhead> i'll do you a demo of how to make it work
[18:34:17] <coldhead> oh okay let me see
[18:34:17] <rbik> <3
[18:35:01] <ole> Hiya, I have an element which I want to be in "active" state when I click it, but if I click anything else on the page, the active state should be cancelled, how would I go about doing that?
[18:35:17] <coldhead> rbik: where are you calling noConflict?
[18:35:45] <rbik> just upload my orginal give me a sec
[18:35:57] <jerkface03> What about adding an icon / changing the color of a list item to signify some kind of error with that item? Just plug in the CSS and modify the dom as well?
[18:36:16] <coldhead> ole: $(document).click(function (e) { if ($(e.target).is('.theThingInQuestion')) return; $('.theThingInQuestion').removeClass('active'); });
[18:36:34] <coldhead> yes jerkface03, probably just an addClass()
[18:36:48] <ole> thanks coldhead, ill try that
[18:37:37] <Jagst3r15> coldhead maybe it cant be done
[18:38:51] <rbik> http://odinbackyard.x10.mx/2contact.html how about now
[18:40:07] <ole> okay coldhead, that messes other stuff up though
[18:40:33] <coldhead> Jagst3r15: sorting tables? can be done
[18:40:38] <coldhead> link to your code again?
[18:40:44] <Jagst3r15> with tablesorter i mean
[18:40:46] <coldhead> ole: can you be more specific?
[18:40:52] <coldhead> rbik: looking now
[18:41:16] <ole> coldhead, it overrides other click stuff
[18:42:20] <ole> anyway coldhead, I can have an unlimited number of elements on the page I want to come in this active state, they are added dynamically
[18:42:22] <ML74> Can someone help with this? http://pastebin.com/VqyBNW7H   It's reloading the page rather than submitting the ajax :/
[18:43:15] <ole> I need to manage some sort of item specific "cancel" event on the item in question if anything but the currently active element is clicked
[18:44:16] <rbik> coldhead, look at what?
[18:46:34] <ole> ML74: where on earth have you learned to use the jQuery object rather than $?
[18:47:30] <coldhead> rbik: i was looking at your updated link
[18:47:35] <ML74> ole: what should i be using? i thought i had to for no conflict?
[18:47:46] <rbik> oh cool <3
[18:47:47] <ole> conflict with what?
[18:48:02] <coldhead> ole: the code i wrote doesn't interfere with any other click events
[18:48:12] <coldhead> it just catches any click events that bubble to the document
[18:48:21] <coldhead> and detects if they were on the element in question or not
[18:48:28] <coldhead> perhaps i have misunderstood the question
[18:48:32] <coldhead> i am a bear of very little brain
[18:52:04] <ML74> ole: other scripts?
[18:53:15] <coldhead> rbik: this is how i'd do it http://jsfiddle.net/uZJ4E/
[18:53:32] <ole> coldhead: I got it working now, the click event on the parent was fired even when the element itself was clicked
[18:53:50] <ole> your e.target thingy helped me detect if it was clicked
[18:53:50] <coldhead> that's how event bubbling works, ole
[18:54:10] <coldhead> everything is also triggered on ancestors all the way up to the document
[18:54:23] <coldhead> unless you prevent it
[18:54:41] <rbik> thanks coldhead!
[18:55:04] <coldhead> enjoy rbik
[18:55:08] <coldhead> happy hacking
[18:55:46] <coldhead> i am going to lunch
[18:55:51] <coldhead> best wishes to you all forever
[18:55:53] <coldhead> AMEN
[18:55:58] <Jagst3r15> later
[19:02:33] <livingstn> It should not be this difficult to find something that can sidescoll images continuously like a marquee.
[19:08:03] <jedimind> livingstn, its not, have you tried looking on the internet?
[19:08:10] <livingstn> I have.
[19:08:11] <jerkface03> How should I add in my click triggers and stuff for the various widgets on my JQuery mobile page? Should I override window.onload(), or is there a JQuery-way to do it?
[19:08:24] <livingstn> I seriously cannot find anything.
[19:08:27] <livingstn> that actually works.
[19:08:39] <livingstn> Tried to implement this: https://github.com/jonmifsud/Web-Ticker/
[19:08:41] <livingstn> doesn't work
[19:10:09] <tw2113> livingstn, http://bxslider.com/examples/ticker-mode
[19:10:32] <jedimind> livingstn, http://flexidev.co.za/projects/flexislider/
[19:10:56] <jerkface03> $(document).live("pageinit".... ? or maybe $("#myPage").live("pageinit"...?
[19:11:08] <jedimind> phew, googling is hard
[19:11:43] <Jagst3r15> tw2113 i am a failure i couldnt figure it out lol
[19:12:20] <tw2113> the only way you fail is if you just give up
[19:12:39] <Jagst3r15> exactly
[19:12:45] <Jagst3r15> lol
[19:14:19] <livingstn> I did google it.
[19:18:08] <Jagst3r15> ill try again 2moro. laters
[19:26:52] <garbagecollectio> can i call controller method from a view
[19:26:56] <garbagecollectio> not controller to view
[19:26:58] <garbagecollectio> but view to controller
[19:27:08] <garbagecollectio> is that good mvc
[19:28:24] <livingstn> garbagecollectio: Ummm…generally the controller passes everything to the view.
[19:28:35] <garbagecollectio> not directly
[19:30:51] <livingstn> garbagecollectio: controller retrieves all of the data from the model, then passes it to the view.
[19:31:20] <garbagecollectio> in javascript you dont want that process to happen directly
[19:31:28] <garbagecollectio> you generally dont want to directly call a view function
[19:31:34] <garbagecollectio> u usually do it via an event emitter
[19:31:43] <garbagecollectio> its called the Observer pattern
[19:32:16] <livingstn> right
[19:32:23] <livingstn> okay, I wasn't sure if you were talking JS or what
[19:32:28] <livingstn> I should have probably realized that. :)
[19:37:48] <garbagecollectio> i dont think ur supposed to either
[19:37:53] <garbagecollectio> view to controller
[19:37:55] <garbagecollectio> directly
[19:38:10] <garbagecollectio> this assignment im doing is kind of bullshit
[19:38:15] <garbagecollectio> its basically building a backbone.js
[19:40:34] <garbagecollectio> what about the model
[19:40:40] <garbagecollectio> can the controller call the model directly?
[19:42:14] <coldhead> how else would the controller interact with the models?
[19:42:32] <coldhead> maybe start by buying them a drink first, controller
[19:42:39] <garbagecollectio> coldhead, via an observer
[19:42:42] <garbagecollectio> via and event system
[19:42:47] <garbagecollectio> so i dont call model functions directly
[19:43:01] <garbagecollectio> the model function subscribe to a controller method being called
[19:43:10] <garbagecollectio> im not sure which one is better
[19:43:15] <coldhead> that's a fancy way of doing it
[19:43:17] <garbagecollectio> cause u have to do that with updating views basically
[19:43:22] <coldhead> it's not part of basic MVC
[19:43:31] <garbagecollectio> the controller shouldnt know about view methods
[19:43:43] <coldhead> no but it can know about views
[19:43:56] <garbagecollectio> right
[19:44:04] <garbagecollectio> so should the controller know about model methods
[19:44:05] <garbagecollectio> ?
[19:44:08] <coldhead> shouldn't the view just have a render method anyway?
[19:44:18] <coldhead> yes of course
[19:44:23] <coldhead> think of the model as providing a service
[19:44:27] <coldhead> it "models" something
[19:44:34] <coldhead> the controller consumes the hell out of that service
[19:44:50] <coldhead> it can't do much controlling if it doesn't know what it's interacting with
[19:44:57] <garbagecollectio> well
[19:45:14] <garbagecollectio> the model shouldnt call controller functions
[19:45:54] <coldhead> no
[19:46:03] <coldhead> the controller is not providing a service to the model
[19:46:15] <garbagecollectio> ok
[19:46:23] <garbagecollectio> i think my fancy dancy code is done
[19:46:35] <coldhead> you should be very proud
[19:46:48] <coldhead> why don't you take a five minute break and get yourself some kind of delicious treat
[19:46:54] <garbagecollectio> u think it sounds good and
[19:47:02] <garbagecollectio> i cant, i deleted all my code for my company by accident
[19:47:06] <garbagecollectio> i gotta work through the night
[19:47:55] <coldhead> oh nooo
[19:48:34] <garbagecollectio> yeah
[19:48:36] <garbagecollectio> its terrible
[19:48:43] <garbagecollectio> if they would find out i would be fired
[19:48:56] <coldhead> you should all be fired for not keeping backups
[19:49:03] <coldhead> fired and killed
[19:49:26] <javalover> does anyone here have instagram?
[19:49:41] <garbagecollectio> yeah i didnt svn it
[19:49:59] <coldhead> that's a very personal question, javalover
[19:50:05] <garbagecollectio> http://hypem.com/track/1r204/woodysproduce+-+UGK+&+OutKast-+Intl+Players+Anthem+%28Woody%27s+Produce+Remix%29
[19:50:50] <tw2113> i have openphoto
[19:51:30] <coldhead> i had a newspaper but i left it in a restaurant
[19:51:51] <javalover> the reason I ask is cuz well I confess
[19:51:57] <javalover> I was doing a bit of instagram stalking
[19:52:03] <javalover> and I accidentally hit the "like" button
[19:52:10] <javalover> i quickly unliked & deleted my account but still
[19:52:25] <javalover> this person can't find out I hit that shit
[19:52:30] <coldhead> they will probably still have got the email
[19:52:32] <javalover> fml
[19:52:37] <javalover> why does it email people
[19:52:38] <javalover> FML!
[19:53:01] <tw2113> restraining order issues?
[19:53:06] <javalover> i was just trying to see who liked the photo
[19:53:12] <javalover> i wasn't trying to like it holy crap
[19:53:19] <coldhead> always stalk through webstagram
[19:53:21] <coldhead> anonymously
[19:53:24] <coldhead> without signing in
[19:53:26] <javalover> i'm such a noob
[19:53:35] <javalover> fuck why did I even use my username
[19:53:38] <javalover> wtf is worng with me
[19:53:48] <coldhead> i'm so sorry javalover
[19:53:50] <javalover> i clicked & unclicked that shit so fast
[19:53:57] <coldhead> sorry for your loss
[19:53:59] <javalover> it really emails you everytime someone likes a photo?
[19:54:06] <coldhead> unless they have it turned off
[19:54:13] <coldhead> but if you were quick you might have gotten away with it!
[19:54:14] <javalover> what's the email say?
[19:54:22] <javalover> can we test this?
[19:54:24] <coldhead> XXX liked your image!
[19:54:26] <javalover> do you have an instagram?
[19:54:34] <javalover> omg so gay
[19:54:35] <coldhead> not anymore!
[19:54:51] <coldhead> i've moved to pinterest now
[19:55:01] <javalover> you don't understand this person
[19:55:04] <javalover> is like..ok
[19:55:05] <coldhead> it better meets my needs of having everything in boxes
[19:55:09] <javalover> there's this girl I like
[19:55:14] <javalover> and i've known her for like 5 years
[19:55:27] <javalover> and this person just happened to show up in her life & they may or may not be going out
[19:55:43] <javalover> if he finds out I hit the like button on his photo
[19:55:44] <javalover> fuck me
[19:56:11] <tw2113> cause you know, hitting like on a photo on a public site online, is equivalent to fucking her
[19:56:16] <javalover> the only question is would he use that shit against me
[19:56:35] <tw2113> to do what?
[19:56:43] <javalover> idk make me out to seem like the creep
[19:56:49] <javalover> when he's the one getting with the girl of my dreams
[19:56:50] <tw2113> her profile is public
[19:57:01] <tw2113> he can sit on it and spin
[19:57:03] <coldhead> the thing to do at theis point is probably to get on the road and wait it out in bad motels
[19:57:17] <javalover> well heres the thing
[19:57:26] <javalover> I only clicked on the button to see like who also liked his photo
[19:57:34] <javalover> i had no idea that was the LIEK BUTTON!
[19:57:36] <javalover> stupid instagram
[19:57:38] <coldhead> what would really make this all more real would be if you linked us to the photo
[19:58:00] <javalover> i could...
[19:58:08] <javalover> but that might make things worse
[19:58:16] <javalover> so here's what happened
[19:58:18] <garbagecollectio> coldhead
[19:58:23] <coldhead> sometimes the only way out is through
[19:58:23] <garbagecollectio> coldhead tell me
[19:58:26] <javalover> i hit the like button it said "liked" I was like NO UNLIKE i clicked it instantly
[19:58:26] <garbagecollectio> if i did it right
[19:58:33] <garbagecollectio> if i did the subscrbe-publsh pattenr right
[19:58:33] <coldhead> PURGE YOURSELF IN THE FLAMES JAVALOVER
[19:58:42] <tw2113> javalover, man the fuck up and just roll with it
[19:58:46] <javalover> then I deleted my account
[19:58:55] <tw2113> if he confronts you, be all like "what of it?"
[19:59:00] <javalover> the account that I had made just to check the likes/comments
[19:59:02] <coldhead> your subscriber patter looked good to me, garbagecollectio
[19:59:05] <javalover> lolol
[19:59:12] <javalover> i'm not so much afraid of him confronting me
[19:59:16] <javalover> as I am of him telling her
[19:59:25] <javalover> cuz if he tells her like "guess who liked my photo" i'm a dead man
[19:59:25] <garbagecollectio> coldhead but what do u think about defining all the subscriptions when the function constructor is built?
[19:59:31] <javalover> I can't be seen as some stalker
[19:59:32] <javalover> fuck that
[19:59:33] <tw2113> "omg?you mean he?liked my instagram photo? wtf"
[19:59:41] <coldhead> i think that's a matter of style, garbagecollectio
[19:59:53] <javalover> but he'd know I was looking at his photos
[19:59:53] <tw2113> it's called an ego stroking
[19:59:56] <coldhead> exactly what happens in constructors is hotly contested
[19:59:57] <javalover> and I don't know this fool
[20:00:08] <garbagecollectio> coldhead, i mean where else would it be accessible
[20:00:08] <tw2113> javalover, it's HER account, right?
[20:00:12] <javalover> no it's his
[20:00:15] <javalover> that's the issue
[20:00:19] <javalover> if it was her i'd be cool with it
[20:00:24] <javalover> like "yeah liked your photo, ur hott"
[20:00:25] <coldhead> javalover: make a fake account, click and unclick the like on your photo, see how much you have to worry about
[20:00:26] <javalover> but this new guy
[20:00:27] <javalover> wtf
[20:00:42] <javalover> yeah...hold up
[20:00:43] <javalover> fuck
[20:00:43] <coldhead> garbagecollectio: you might have a do_subscriptions() fn
[20:00:44] <tw2113> if he says anything, just say "yeah, it was a good photo"
[20:00:54] <coldhead> which is called from within the constructor
[20:00:55] <garbagecollectio> coldhead good idea
[20:00:56] <javalover> i'm never gonna talk to this guy
[20:00:59] <javalover> i'm afraid he's gonna tell the girl
[20:01:02] <javalover> that's what scares me the most
[20:01:09] <tw2113> because you lack testicles
[20:01:11] <javalover> if he says some shit i'd be like "so what douche ur with my girl"
[20:01:19] <coldhead> you could probably do better anyway javalover
[20:01:24] <tw2113> seriously, stop worrying
[20:01:29] <javalover> fuck me man
[20:01:35] <javalover> i was just curious if anyone knew like
[20:01:36] <coldhead> that's what she says to him
[20:01:39] <javalover> will it record that shit?
[20:01:48] <coldhead> it does
[20:01:58] <javalover> even if i instantly hit unlike?
[20:02:00] <tw2113> i hope it does, and i hope no one says anything about it
[20:02:06] <coldhead> i have never tried
[20:02:08] <javalover> lololol tw
[20:02:16] <javalover> aight imma test this 1 sec
[20:02:36] <tw2113> don't forget to comb your hair over 1 eye
[20:03:10] <coldhead> how did you know how i wear my hair tw2113
[20:03:26] <tw2113> i was talking to javalover but if you want to emulate him...
[20:04:20] <coldhead> i was wearing emo hair before javalover was even conceived
[20:05:06] <javalover> k i'm uploading my photo
[20:05:09] <javalover> bout to test this shit
[20:05:16] <javalover> knowing him he has default settings so...
[20:05:33] <javalover> now to make another account holy shit
[20:05:43] <tw2113> i hope he high fives you
[20:05:48] <tw2113> forever leaving you confused
[20:06:17] <coldhead> you're so mean tw2113
[20:07:00] <tw2113> i know
[20:07:03] <javalover> noooooooooooo
[20:07:07] <javalover> someone has to test this for me
[20:07:12] <javalover> "too many accounts created on this device"
[20:07:13] <tw2113> i want nothing to happen to javalover and for him to be just paranoid
[20:07:16] <javalover> wait can i use webstagram?
[20:07:40] <coldhead> i don't think you can create accounts there
[20:07:44] <javalover> ugh
[20:07:44] <javalover> wtf
[20:07:51] <javalover> dude please test this for me
[20:07:52] <javalover> someone
[20:08:28] <coldhead> why don't you just call the guy
[20:08:35] <coldhead> and say "hey i liked your photo
[20:08:40] <coldhead> did you get an email about it?"
[20:08:45] <javalover> cuz i don't know him
[20:08:48] <javalover> that's why this is so awkward
[20:08:54] <javalover> if I knew him i'd be like so what
[20:09:03] <coldhead> want me to call him?
[20:09:04] <javalover> but he knows my username
[20:09:07] <javalover> so he's gonna know!
[20:09:12] <tw2113> he knows you're old one
[20:09:14] <tw2113> before you deleted
[20:09:21] <javalover> i mean...
[20:09:27] <javalover> as far as anyone is concerned I don't have an instagram
[20:09:30] <javalover> cuz my shit is deleted
[20:09:31] <javalover> but still
[20:09:52] <tw2113> do you really think he's going to care enough to go "hey girl in this picture, this ID of "foobarjavaperson" liked your photo"
[20:10:10] <tw2113> is she even going to recognize it?
[20:10:32] <javalover> wait you can like & unlike ur own photo?
[20:10:41] <tw2113> i have no idea, i'm not on instagram
[20:10:42] <javalover> she won't see it only the guy will see it
[20:10:43] <coldhead> they are probably too busy having hot sexy sex to notice who likes their photos
[20:10:51] <javalover> oh you bstard!
[20:10:53] <javalover> you take that back!!
[20:10:57] <tw2113> twice
[20:11:00] <coldhead> i don't think you'll get an email about it
[20:11:01] <tw2113> and once in the morning
[20:11:08] <coldhead> if it's your photo
[20:11:11] <javalover> ok I liked & unliked my own photo
[20:11:19] <javalover> so far nothing....
[20:11:19] <coldhead> i am kidding javalover, no one really ever has sex
[20:11:22] <javalover> can someone else do it?
[20:11:39] <javalover> tw can you help a brother out?
[20:11:46] <tw2113> $('#javalover').growTesticles();
[20:11:50] <coldhead> i am trying to think who here has instagram
[20:12:03] <tw2113> i have no reason to join instagram
[20:12:22] <javalover> damn does anyone have instagram?
[20:13:18] <tw2113> javalover, does she even know your former ID on there?
[20:13:28] <tw2113> or is it going to come off as "some random user"
[20:14:27] <tw2113> anyone actually have some jquery issues?
[20:15:49] <javalover> trust me, she knows my id
[20:16:00] <javalover> but she won't see it unless she has his email
[20:16:03] <javalover> which she probably doesn't
[20:16:27] <javalover> but I just found out, instagram only gives you notifications on ur phone if you have an iphone!
[20:16:33] <tw2113> so you just confirmed you're paranoid
[20:16:35] <javalover> which he probably does...
[20:16:43] <javalover> but even then you have to have it turned on
[20:17:01] <coldhead> you're probably fine then javalover
[20:17:03] <javalover> and according to the site depending on how fast you unliked it, internet access etc.
[20:17:06] <javalover> yeah i'm probably in the clear
[20:17:07] <coldhead> let's try to move on
[20:17:15] <javalover> and if anything does his bitch ass have hte guts to bring it up & would it be wierd
[20:17:20] <javalover> so probably nothing will ever come from that
[20:17:31] <coldhead> weird*
[20:17:38] <javalover> but i'm so done looking at his profile/photos
[20:17:40] <javalover> eff that shit!
[20:17:41] <coldhead> something has come of it
[20:17:45] <coldhead> we've grown as people
[20:17:52] <coldhead> we've learned something about the world
[20:17:56] <tw2113> i wasted an hour
[20:17:57] <coldhead> and something about ourselves
[20:18:12] <coldhead> AND WE'VE LEARNED TO LOVE AGAIN
[20:20:29] <jrodl3r> lol
[20:21:10] <coldhead> it's the great love of all
[20:21:20] <tw2113> are you high on life coldhead ?
[20:21:23] <jrodl3r> indeed
[20:21:48] <coldhead> it's a brain injury i incurred during the rigours of child birth
[20:22:00] <jrodl3r> ouch
[20:29:29] <javalover> ok i just tested the crap out of this
[20:29:34] <javalover> there is no way in hell he saw it
[20:29:59] <javalover> first of all, when you hit refresh it grabs the list from php & stores it on the phone
[20:30:07] <javalover> he'd have to had refreshed at the exact same time that i hit the button
[20:30:11] <javalover> and I instantly unliked
[20:30:17] <javalover> it reads the boolean on that
[20:30:29] <javalover> and if anything it just shows who did what on ur photo that's it
[20:30:37] <javalover> as soon as it refreshes again it's gone
[20:30:40] <javalover> there is no email no nothing
[20:30:48] <javalover> no proof so I can deny it
[20:30:49] <javalover> lol
[20:35:09] <coldhead> congratulations javalover
[20:35:18] <coldhead> what a triumph of the human spirit
[20:40:36] * tw2113 is going to go stalk random strangers on instagram now
[20:47:06] <mfoxdogg|work> hey all i have an interesting question, say i have a div with some overflow that is not being displayed, how do i get the overflowing data so i can display it in another div, acting kinda like a read more button
[20:55:01] <jrockjiggz> mfoxdogg|work: find your content that is missing out of view, detect its position inside container, then move position: absolute left the amount you are out of frame
[20:55:28] <mfoxdogg|work> yeah but how do you figure out what is out of frame
[20:56:39] <jrockjiggz> mfoxdogg|work, there isnt a way explicitl
[20:56:50] <jrockjiggz> best to not rely on overflow
[20:57:16] <jrockjiggz> but, you can read the width of your container, and use that information accordingly
[20:59:51] <mfoxdogg|work> hmmmm
[21:00:14] <jrockjiggz> is it horizontal or vertical?
[21:00:42] <mfoxdogg|work> vertical
[21:00:49] <jrockjiggz> if vertical, you can use the scroll height && viewport height to determine..
[21:02:18] <mfoxdogg|work> sorry for going on but how exactly do i do that with just text no tags as its just 1 giant div
[21:02:34] <mfoxdogg|work> stupid i know but thats what i have to work with
[21:05:36] <jrockjiggz> mfoxdogg|work: i was going to say - maybe you shouldn't be letting your content overflow, have you tried to fix that?
[21:05:42] <piker32> http://pastie.org/5363906  => any ideas as to why this request would fail to POST?
[21:05:59] <piker32> only thing i can see is the content type resolving to "Content-Type: application/vnd.ms-excel"
[21:06:03] <piker32> when its a CSV file
[21:06:06] <mfoxdogg|work> jrockjiggz: not possible, layout has been detimined and content has been given
[21:06:32] <jrockjiggz> piker32: i dont see anything wrong
[21:06:44] <piker32> hmmm
[21:07:03] <jrockjiggz> mfoxdogg|work: is the div scrolling?
[21:07:19] <mfoxdogg|work> no
[21:08:29] <jrockjiggz> overflow: hidden?
[21:09:03] <aqeel> hi room
[21:09:10] <aqeel> whats up
[21:09:51] <srikat> what's the function that will add text after a element? When I use http://pastebin.com/iYeRS4gg , my desired text is getting added at the end of specified element, but I want it to be added AFTER that element
[21:10:08] <jrockjiggz> ?after
[21:10:08] <bot-t> .after(content, [content]): Insert content, specified by the parameter, after each element in the set of matched elements. http://api.jquery.com/after/
[21:10:20] <srikat> thanks, will go through that
[21:11:25] <aqeel> u can use after() or append()
[21:15:12] <mfoxdogg|work> jrockjiggz: yes overflow is hidden
[21:15:36] <piker32> weird, the second i actually attach a file it fails
[21:16:56] <nights`> seriously
[21:17:05] <nights`> photoshop fucking crash all the fucking time
[21:17:08] <nights`> fuck fuck fuck
[21:17:35] <nights`> what the fuck is the problem with the piece shit app
[21:17:41] <nights`> @#$%^&*(
[21:18:16] <aqeel> 32 or 64 bit
[21:18:26] <aqeel> do u have enough ram
[21:18:41] <aqeel> is your cpu under required specification
[21:18:58] <aqeel> recently i upgraded my system and works like charm
[21:19:03] <nights`> its 64 bit
[21:19:10] <nights`> ive been using photoshop for like 10 years
[21:19:18] <aqeel> me too/ less or more
[21:19:31] <nights`> ive never had this type of behavior before
[21:19:39] <nights`> have like 10gb free ram
[21:19:42] <aqeel> every now wnd then before major release the last few updates will crash the system
[21:19:52] <nights`> both cs3 and cs5 is crashing
[21:19:58] <aqeel> always happened to me
[21:20:04] <nights`> recently but today just driving me completely nuts
[21:20:12] <nights`> almost smashed my desk -_-
[21:20:12] <aqeel> both???? try not to install both
[21:20:18] <aqeel> either one of them
[21:20:21] <nights`> why not?
[21:20:23] <nights`> hm
[21:20:52] <nights`> ok let me try to uninstall cs3
[21:20:59] <aqeel> they have mentioned in their site too
[21:21:01] <nights`> doubtful it will help this
[21:21:04] <nights`> really
[21:23:35] <nights`> ok
[21:23:39] <nights`> following your advice
[21:23:44] <nights`> removed that cs3 sucker
[21:23:48] <srikat> using http://pastebin.com/Kex3hJkL to insert "//" to separate WP menu items. Is there a way to remove the separator text for the last menu item (.builder-module-navigation li:last-child a)?
[21:27:21] <srikat> http://www.screencast.com/t/O7qwOMqy4OUT
[21:28:15] <jerkface03> $("#serverList-list").appendChild($("<li></li>").text(key));   <-- Does anything look wrong with this? #serverList-list is a <ul> element. Key is the text that's suppose to go inside of the list item i'm trying to add
[21:33:39] <srikat> ..
[21:34:44] <nights`> aqeel: ok very interesting
[21:34:46] <nights`> i found the solution
[21:34:55] <jrockjiggz> bad video card?
[21:35:16] <aqeel> and what was it
[21:35:31] <jrockjiggz> nights` will surely deliver
[21:36:43] <aqeel> cannot be bad video card...
[21:37:50] <aqeel> if that was to be the case there should be otehr problems too ..
[21:38:10] <aqeel> photoshop runs on the profile
[21:39:36] <nights`> here it is
[21:39:47] <nights`> its been fucking up photoshop use for me since like 3 month ago
[21:39:55] <nights`> http://helpx.adobe.com/photoshop/kb/crash-using-move-tool-photoshop.html
[21:40:03] <nights`> some app i use called jdownloader
[21:40:18] <nights`> has a feature that scans the clipboard for new links
[21:40:46] <nights`> noticed photoshop crashed almost exclusively when adding copying layers and moving those around
[21:40:55] <jrockjiggz> good tip
[21:41:07] <nights`> who would have known
[21:41:19] <nights`> been messing around with my graphics drivers, enabling on and off opengl
[21:41:19] <aqeel> well i do not have jdownloader
[21:41:23] <nights`> memory stuff
[21:41:27] <nights`> just uninstalled cs3 ;)
[21:41:33] <aqeel> well i do not have jdownloader
[21:41:34] <nights`> obviously without need
[21:41:41] <jrockjiggz> i've used it, never thought about it
[21:41:48] <nights`> a lot of people use it
[21:41:55] <nights`> its great for pulling things from youtube
[21:42:13] <aqeel> you can use realplayer downlaod
[21:42:20] <aqeel> to grab any video from any ssite
[21:42:36] <nights`> ok
[21:42:41] <aqeel> and top of all its free
[21:42:48] <aqeel> have a converter too
[21:42:48] <nights`> jdownloader is free too
[21:42:56] <aqeel> to any device
[21:43:03] <nights`> ok
[21:43:05] <nights`> pretty neat
[21:43:10] <nights`> but as they say
[21:43:15] <nights`> dont fix what aint broken
[21:43:20] <aqeel> yup
[21:43:25] <nights`> well, i guess that clipboard feature could be fixed ...
[21:43:44] <aqeel> hope so
[21:56:12] <aqeel> http://jsfiddle.net/5efyU/
[21:56:43] <aqeel> i would like to create a window.load() and stop the function customload(), whwich is a spinner
[21:57:28] <aqeel> some how the window.load(alert('loaded'););....is not returning
[22:07:36] <aqeel> any care to look into my question
[22:08:12] <aqeel> can i check if the content have been indeed loaded into object tag
[22:08:24] <aqeel> unlike load().
[22:09:45] <heyho_> hi all, need the right syntax from (how do i write "this"): ...each...  { $(this+".lupenbox img").css('opacity','0.8'); .....
[22:13:34] <Cork> heyho_: $(this).find('.lupenbox img')
[22:19:21] <aqeel> hey cork long time no see
[22:19:35] <Cork> o/
[22:19:36] <aqeel> how a re you
[22:19:50] <Cork> busy :)

[22:21:18] <aqeel> hope you not stress yourself with too much to do
[22:22:14] <Cork> i normally don't stress
[22:22:25] <aqeel> glad to hear that
[22:22:45] <Cork> just getting focused and try to get it done :)
[22:23:15] <aqeel> may you succeed in your aim and continue to dorment what comes at you
[22:23:28] <Cork> lol thx
[22:24:10] <coldhead> dorment?
[22:24:14] <coldhead> dominate?
[22:24:23] <heyho_> @Cort: THX
[22:24:28] <heyho_> Cork
[22:24:38] <coldhead> hey Crok
[22:24:53] <aqeel> perspective , u can see how one sees fit...
[22:25:27] <coldhead> i think some of the perspective is lodged in my eye
[22:25:38] <aqeel> haha
[22:26:39] <aqeel> well got to go...
[22:26:50] <aqeel> have nice time coldhead and cork
[22:30:30] <ackpacket> if i'm receiving this back from the server through a $.ajax POST, {items: '9', price: '179.91'}  how can I turn that into something usable?  like data.price and data.items
[22:31:03] <Cork> ackpacket: you can treat it as javascript, but you need to set it to a variable first
[22:31:14] <Cork> ackpacket: or you can change the format, and treat it as json
[22:31:30] <Cork> but then it has to be {"items": "9", "price": "179.91"}
[22:31:39] <Cork> (else its not valid json)
[22:31:49] <ackpacket> Why do I see some jquery where the first of each pair is not in double quotes?
[22:32:05] <Cork> cause thats javascript objects
[22:32:11] <ackpacket> ah
[22:32:45] <ackpacket> When using $.ajax,  my callback function receives a variable called data,  containing {items: '9', price: '179.91'}
[22:33:00] <ackpacket> do I need to set it to a variable even though data == {items: '9', price: '179.91'}
[22:33:01] <ackpacket> ?
[22:33:05] <Cork> ackpacket: wait i think i missed your question a bit
[22:33:32] <Cork> ackpacket: are you talking server or client side here?
[22:34:07] <ackpacket> client side, upon the user's request, I am making a $.ajax call using POST to a php page that removes an item from their shopping cart
[22:34:12] <ackpacket> the page replies with {items: '9', price: '179.91'}
[22:34:19] <Cork> ok
[22:34:26] <Cork> the php page should use json_encode
[22:34:31] <Cork> ?g php json_encode
[22:34:33] <bot-t> Cork, PHP: json_encode - Manual - http://php.net/manual/en/function.json-encode.php
[22:34:44] <ackpacket> so i have function ajaxDone(data) {};
[22:34:53] <Cork> and set http header Content-Type: application/json
[22:35:03] <ackpacket> wait, but that's javascript object notation, I want it usable as a javascript object
[22:35:03] <Cork> ?g php header
[22:35:04] <bot-t> Cork, PHP: header - Manual - http://php.net/manual/en/function.header.php
[22:35:33] <Cork> ackpacket: make a php array and give it to json_encode and it will be the correct format
[22:36:00] <ackpacket> and upon receiving the proper format, i will be able to use data.price and data.items?
[22:36:07] <Cork> yes
[22:36:12] <ackpacket> ah
[22:36:17] <ackpacket> I'll just manually add the quotes
[22:36:22] <ackpacket> it's very small
[22:36:30] <Cork> the header command is important
[22:36:42] <Cork> ackpacket: and you shouldn't create the json your self
[22:36:44] <Cork> its a bad idea
[22:37:03] <Cork> you have to be careful with escapes and things like that
[22:37:17] <Cork> and it doesn't become biger from using the json_encode
[22:37:36] <ackpacket> I know but for testing it's easier to add 4 \" then to make an array
[22:37:41] <ackpacket> i did it in under a second
[22:38:35] <Cork> ackpacket:  <?php echo json_encode(array( 'item' => 'value', 'item2' => 'value2' )); %>
[22:38:48] <Cork> its strongly recommended solution
[22:39:05] <ackpacket> Cork, what's the difference between {first : "john", last : "doe"}  and {"first" : "john", "last" : "doe"}??
[22:39:35] <Cork> ackpacket: the first is javascript object valid, the second is valid javascript object AND JSON
[22:39:51] <Cork> *the first is valid javascript object
[22:40:12] <ackpacket> so if I use var myVar = (either of those two)
[22:40:18] <ackpacket> i can do myVar.first
[22:40:19] <ackpacket> ?
[22:40:25] <Cork> if its in javascript yes
[22:40:28] <Cork> not in json
[22:40:41] <ackpacket> wait, you said they are both valid javascript objects
[22:40:48] <Cork> valid for yes
[22:41:03] <Cork> it depends on how its given to the browser
[22:41:08] <ackpacket> hmm
[22:41:17] <ackpacket> seems like the two are confusingly similar
[22:41:24] <Cork> they are
[22:41:32] <Cork> ackpacket: json is a subset of javascript
[22:41:41] <Cork> its more strict then what javascript is
[22:41:53] <Cork> thats why only one way of writing objects is allowed
[22:43:03] <Cork> ackpacket: in javascript all these are valid { key:'val', 'key':'val', "key":'val', key:"val", 'key':"val", "key":"val" }
[22:43:21] <Cork> ackpacket: in json { "key":"val" } is the only valid format
[22:43:30] <ackpacket> hmm... ok
[22:43:44] <Cork> ackpacket: and cause json is so much more strict, you SHOULD reall use the encoder
[22:44:12] <Cork> *really
[22:44:32] <ackpacket> I come from a heavy c++ background, imagine my confusion seeing some function StoreNames({first : "john", last : "doe"}}
[22:44:50] <ackpacket> that last curly brace should be a )
[22:44:59] <Cork> ya, i remember, i'm from c/c++ background my self
[22:45:03] <ackpacket> why do people choose to pass parameters using objects?
[22:45:20] <ackpacket> why not just have StoreNames("john", "doe")
[22:45:21] <Cork> its more manageable in the long run
[22:45:28] <ackpacket> The only benefit I see is that the parameter order doesn't matter
[22:45:57] <Cork> for that example its fine, but when you come back say 2 years later and have do_action(1, true, false, "Now it works")
[22:46:38] <Cork> compared to do_action({ loops: 1, progress: true, fatal_warnings: false, message: "Now it works" })
[22:46:51] <ackpacket> I would think that's what code hinting is for
[22:46:55] <snover> if you use underscores in your javascript identifiers you’re an asshole
[22:47:00] <snover> —crockford
[22:47:01] <ackpacket> hahaha
[22:47:51] <ackpacket> Where can I go on here to learn about rss feeds?  Or is anyone willing to PM me?
[22:48:03] <ackpacket> or, if noone minds, we could talk here even though its off topic :D
[22:48:04] <Cork> rss feeds??
[22:48:12] <Cork> what does that have to do with jquery?
[22:48:35] <ackpacket> Nothing, I was asking for channel suggestions
[22:48:47] <Cork> then you should ask in a fitting channel
[22:49:05] <ackpacket> oi
[22:53:26] <ackpacket> Well thanks for the help cork
[22:53:32] <ackpacket> everything's working smoothly
[23:09:32] <danmichel> I'm looking for a way to asynchronously load the contents of a whole div. so far, I'm preloading the div .orbit-wrapper, but only the background images load async. Id like to delay loading of everything in that div until the page has fully loaded. ideally, with an ajax-loader.gif as the background http://varmag.com/
[23:14:46] <Cork> danmichel: you can't delay the loading of a div; at all
[23:14:59] <danmichel> i see Cork
[23:15:04] <Cork> danmichel: you can exclude it from the page and load a partial through ajax
[23:15:18] <Cork> but thats the only way
[23:15:27] <danmichel> what do you mean?
[23:15:43] <Cork> <div id="container"></div>
[23:16:11] <Cork> $(function() { $('#container').load('/path/to/partial.html'); });
[23:16:25] <Cork> or use .load if you want it to be even later
[23:19:35] <Bauer> guys, I have an error saying object has no method prop, even though I use jQuery 1.7.1, how do I debug this issue?
[23:20:09] <Cork> Bauer: what does control.log($.jquery) give you if you run it on that line?
[23:20:32] <Bauer> ReferenceError: control is not defined
[23:21:03] <Cork> bah sorry console.log -_-'
[23:21:16] <Bauer> undefined
[23:21:32] <Cork> and console.log($) ?
[23:22:02] <Bauer> function (E,F){return new o.fn.init(E,F)}
[23:22:40] <Cork> Bauer: search for return new o.fn.init(E,F) in your source tree
[23:24:13] <Bauer> Cork: its not showing up on the jquery file
[23:24:23] <Cork> cause its not
[23:24:31] <Cork> you need to search your source tree
[23:24:36] <Cork> something is overwriting $
[23:24:45] <Bauer> what do you mean source tree?
[23:25:07] <Cork> the folder structure where you have your source files
[23:27:17] <danmichel> Cork: $(function() { $('#home_conta').load(<?php "'" . get_template_directory() . '/loop-slideshow.php' . "'" ?>); });
[23:28:27] <Bauer> found it!! you were right, an enormous chunk of javascript code is embedded in index.php - jQuery v1.3.2.. thanks Cork, so in the fugure I do console.log($) to find out what is overwriting it...
[23:28:36] <Bauer> now I need to figure out how to get rid of the old jquery
[23:30:57] <Cork> Bauer: yes, that was the exact reason
[23:31:01] <danmichel> that it Cork?
[23:31:21] <Cork> ya, that should work
[23:39:17] <danmichel> hmm, don't see the difference in my webpage test, but i guess that's all i can do? http://www.webpagetest.org/result/121112_6M_1899ea12e33f5acdff29a0184a99a44b/1/details/ http://varmag.com/ I'm not even sure if it's working
[23:39:33] <danmichel> any idea how id check if its working Cork?
[23:40:36] <Cork> you're loading a few big jpg files there
[23:41:57] <Cork> looks like that css file should be possible to optimize too
[23:42:15] <Cork> 500 ms to load a css files seams huge to me
[23:45:07] <Bauer> Cork: how can I output loaded jquery version?
[23:45:24] <Cork> Bauer: console.log($.jquery)
[23:45:24] <gnarf> Bauer: $.fn.jquery
[23:45:33] <Cork> is if in fn...
[23:45:40] <gnarf> Cork: yeah
[23:46:10] <danmichel> I've done all i could there. I'm getting As on everything. it's me wanting to load the slider images asynchronously without messing up the slide effect Cork. i did lazy load on them, but it messed up the slide effect. sped my site up by 2 seconds
[23:46:16] <Cork> so it is -_-'
[23:46:17] <Bauer> interesting.. the fn variant works now but not the $
[23:46:36] <Bauer> console.log($.jquery)
[23:46:36] <Bauer> undefined
[23:46:42] <Bauer> $.fn.jquery
[23:46:42] <Cork> ya i think its ui that puts it there
[23:46:42] <Bauer> "1.7.1"
[23:46:45] <Cork> i mixed it up
[23:46:53] <Cork> $.ui.version if i remember correctly
[23:47:09] <Bauer> no, I dont use the UI
[23:47:18] <Cork> lol thats not what i meant
[23:47:30] <Cork> Bauer: i remembered the wrong location $.jquery never works
