[06:29:02] <LooInSpain> Is anyone else having trouble downloading jqueryui? I get an error 502 when I try
[07:21:24] <silv3r_m00n> hi there
[07:22:00] <silv3r_m00n> i have created a ui widget and made it like a jquery plugin that i would call like this, $('.nice-ui-dropdown').nicedropdown();
[07:22:58] <silv3r_m00n> but sometimes there are dom elements created dynamically like adding a new row to a table, then when i call table.find('.nice-ui-dropdown').nicedropdown();  it says .nice-ui-dropdown is not a function
