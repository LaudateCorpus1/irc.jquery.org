[02:07:41] <GoSox> ok i have a question about how jquery works
[02:08:28] <GoSox> Take this code for example. If you click the first red box, you get a second red box. But if you look at the javascript, i also try to manipulate an ID called "smellyfish", which doesn't exist. This does not seem to throw any errors, or stop execusion of the script.
[02:08:29] <GoSox> https://jsfiddle.net/4yycacpy/13/
[02:09:16] <GoSox> So my question is, is that normal behavior I can rely on? The use being that I can re-use the same javascript on different pages that are similar but not identical. Just by adding extra commands for extra elements, that will be ignored on the page that doesn't contain those elements
[05:28:46] <Neo_122> hi

[06:22:27] <Uhkis> Neo_122: you need event delegation
[06:22:50] <Neo_122> Uhkiss, I made that use body
[06:24:20] <Uhkis> Neo_122: ie. $('#static_element').on('click', '.dynamic_element', function(){});
[06:24:36] <Neo_122> ok

[11:23:35] <Kartagis> ahoy
[11:23:48] <Kartagis> what's wrong with this? http://paste.debian.net/926595/
[11:24:07] <Kartagis> 1st line works on phone console
[11:25:06] <Kartagis> the rest throws 415 unsupported media type on the phone
[12:24:32] <Uhkis> Kartagis: fd in that context is the click event, not the one from line 5
[12:26:15] <Uhkis> same goes for the arr on the earlier click handlers
[12:26:17] <Uhkis> -s
[12:26:39] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I thought I explicitly set fd to FormData
[12:28:05] <Uhkis> Kartagis: just rename those click handlers event argument or even completely remove those
[12:32:48] <Kartagis> it seems I forgot to remove those
[12:33:09] <Kartagis> I mean function(fd) and function(arr)
[12:33:16] <Kartagis> I removed now
[12:34:30] <Kartagis> bad request now
[12:35:16] <Kartagis> I did xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type","multipart/form-data" too
[12:37:13] <Kartagis> I did it!
[12:37:23] <Kartagis> removed that too
[12:38:33] <Kartagis> thanks Uhkis
[12:58:17] <Clex> $("a.foo").click(...) works but $("body").on("click", "a.foo", function(){}) doesn't, how is it possible?

[19:14:43] <maktm> is the jQuery function (or $) considered a constructor?
[19:15:00] <maktm> i'm asking because i know constructors are used in conjuction with 'new'
[19:15:17] <maktm> but normally you just write code like $(""), which looks like a simple function (not a constructor)
[19:15:30] <maktm> but answers like this say it is a constructor (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4083351/what-does-jquery-fn-mean)
[19:15:31] <cannap> $ is like a function
[19:15:40] <cannap> constructor
[19:15:42] <cannap> yes
[19:15:52] <cannap> which return this on each call like $().bla ..
[19:16:27] <cannap> and bla returns the object/element what ever
[19:16:54] <cannap> $ is just an alias for jQuery
[19:22:28] <shoky> maktm: jQuery.fn.init is the actual constructor function that's called with 'new'.  but jQuery is also considered a constructor, as it constructs a new object and returns it. and you can call it with 'new' if you want
[21:33:43] <Kadigan> Wouldn't that make it a factory?
