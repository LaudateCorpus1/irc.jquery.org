[05:23:46] <V7> So after you click on "+" you'll see details. It works on first table, but not on others ... so if you click on "+" button in second table you'll see that it opens details inforamtion in first table.

[10:31:27] <rjCousineau> Hello.
[10:32:07] <rjCousineau> I'm passing a reference to an $el and then setting $el.data('var','value') but when I return from my function the DOM doesn't show the new data attribute values
[11:05:36] <rjCousineau> wow.. took me hour and half to realize the bug with chrome dev tools. I had to close dev and re-open, and it started working as expected
[11:13:04] <jak2000> rjCousineau: delete cahce?
[11:13:38] <jak2000> cache?
[11:17:59] <rjCousineau> JAK2000?
[11:18:06] <rjCousineau> browser cache?
[11:18:40] <rjCousineau> It's still doing it. where, Elements will show wrong attribute data values, but the code will use the correct ones. makes debugging confusing
[12:23:16] <anli> What is the blue outline here? https://i.imgur.com/GY8ZR2x.png
[12:23:45] <anli> If I go into the dev tools, the outline is gone and cannot be investigated
[12:24:26] <anli> If I make the browser window active again, the outline is coming back
[13:09:33] <rjCousineau> Is there a jqueryUI or bootstrap way of having a checkbox look like a button?
[13:10:17] <rjCousineau> found one: https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/featured/jquery-checkbox-buttons
[13:11:59] <shoky> anli: that's the focus outline, showing what element is focused. you can force the element state to :focus in the devtools element view (in chrome at least). and in css you can target it with :focus
[13:14:31] <anli> shoky: I tried that, but it seems the browser is immune when the dev tools window has the focus, maybe its different if it is docked to the browser
[13:15:06] <anli> Immune meaning that the outline will not show up
[13:16:22] <shoky> anli: it's working fine for me, both docked and undocked. maybe you're putting it on the wrong element?
[13:16:50] <shoky> i'm trying here  https://jqueryui.com/dialog/#default

[13:40:56] <jak2020> hi friend... for generate graphs? professional?
[13:58:42] <rjCousineau> jak2020: i enjoy highcharts
[14:15:56] <rjCousineau> I have a <SELECT SIZE=20> that allows you to see all <option> elements.  I have a 'change' event bound to the <SELECT>.  I want to select a specific item by default and fire the 'change' event.  $('option#default').trigger('change') works, except that item is not highlighted in the browser...
[14:17:13] <jak2020> rjCousineau thanks
[14:20:57] <jak2020> rjCousineau: https://www.highcharts.com/demo  and https://canvasjs.com/javascript-charts/  and http://www.chartjs.org/samples/latest/   cual otra?
[14:38:12] <rjCousineau> nm about my question.  it can't be done
[14:39:34] <rjCousineau> I haven't used any of them. they look good though
[14:39:41] <rjCousineau> gtg, have a good weekend
[14:44:48] <jak2020> <select id='myselect' class='form-control'><option value='1'>1</option><option value='2'>2</option ><option value='3'>3</option><option value='4' selected>4</option></select>
[14:45:18] <jak2020> or: $("#myselect").val(4);
[14:46:02] <jak2020> :(
[16:57:02] <wortelus> hi
[17:00:16] <V7> Hey all ;)
[17:00:37] <V7> Why $( e.target ).find( "class" ) finds only 1 selection ?
[17:01:52] <V7> It 100% has more than 1 elements with this class
[17:05:19] <V7> https://jsfiddle.net/yh5cpf7a/
[17:11:34] <shoky> V7: <tr> is not a valid child of <div>
[17:11:54] <V7> I know, but
[17:12:13] <shoky> look in the devtools elements panel, inspect the <div> , you'll see it has no children
[17:12:32] <shoky> there is no "but" :P

[17:19:50] <V7> Thank you ;)
