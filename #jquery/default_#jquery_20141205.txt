[00:39:47] <Kartagis> no it doesn't anymore
[00:50:16] <abailarri> Hello. Is posible make a $("body").on('click', '.load-more-events-day', function() but for some selector?
[00:51:30] <doug64k> .load-more-events-day already is a selector
[00:51:42] <doug64k> you mean add more?

[00:52:12] <wa5ted> Kartagis: you have to look at your config on local system vs online
[00:52:33] <wa5ted> Kartagis: also is that a notification message?

[00:53:30] <wa5ted> enjoy
[00:53:48] <wa5ted> Kartagis: also why are you using jquery 1.6.4
[00:54:31] <Kartagis> wa5ted: actually, this jquery version is much lower, but the lowest on jsfiddle is 1.6.4
[00:54:38] <Kartagis> hence .live
[00:54:52] <wa5ted> but im asking why are you using 1.6.4
[00:54:57] <wa5ted> what does it offer that 1.10.1
[00:55:09] <wa5ted> or 1.10.2 or 1.11.1
[00:55:11] <wa5ted> doesnt ofer
[00:59:24] <Kartagis> wa5ted: the jquery version on the site is much lower
[00:59:50] <wa5ted> what is 'the site'
[00:59:56] <wa5ted> Kartagis: ^
[01:00:07] <wa5ted> and why is who ever is using 1.6.4 using 1.6.4
[01:01:32] <Kartagis> wa5ted: https://www.tubitekuz.com
[01:01:55] <wa5ted> Kartagis: okay....
[01:02:00] <wa5ted> poin being

[01:02:38] <wa5ted> Kartagis: your building a freelancing site?
[01:02:51] <Kartagis> wa5ted: yeah
[01:11:04] <Kartagis> wa5ted: sooooooooooo, you still suggest that I use snackbarjs?
[01:11:26] <wa5ted> Kartagis: im still at the stage of who ever owns that site why the hell they are using 1.6.4
[01:11:29] <wa5ted> jquery version
[01:11:36] <wa5ted> qhen 1.11.0 is available
[01:11:42] <wa5ted> and has a hell of a lot more features
[01:12:02] <Kartagis> wa5ted: I know, Drupal hasn't updated jquery version for a while
[01:12:10] <Uhkis> jquery_update ;)
[01:12:17] <Kartagis> why, I don't know
[01:12:24] <Cork> ?g drupal jquery_update
[01:12:25] <b-ot> Cork: jQuery Update | Drupal.org → https://www.drupal.org/project/jquery_update
[01:12:31] <Cork> not an excuse
[01:12:51] <Kartagis> Uhkis: jquery_update breaks some collapsibe fieldsets
[01:12:55] <Cork> drupal snapshots the jquery version on every major update
[01:12:59] <wa5ted> Kartagis: read https://www.drupal.org/node/1058168
[01:13:34] <wa5ted> Cork: thanks for saving the day

[01:16:10] <Cork> wa5ted: uh, why?
[01:16:27] <wa5ted> I kept getting the same answer: i have to use this versio of jquery
[01:16:39] <wa5ted> and i was getting vague answers
[01:16:39] <Cork> ah
[01:16:43] <wa5ted> until i asked a dozen questions
[01:17:53] <Kartagis> plus, I type in this code, it loads (I can see it in dev tools), but it doesn't have any effect :S
[01:18:08] <Kartagis> s/plus,\ //
[01:19:16] <Uhkis> Kartagis: on admin interface?
[01:19:24] <Kartagis> Uhkis: yep
[01:19:40] <Uhkis> Kartagis: you can choose different jq version for admin interface
[01:58:33] <disorder> hello people
[02:01:39] <disorder> I implemented a button that gives my input fields a disabled attribute, basically what I want to do is a button toggle, If the clicked element (active element) has attr(disabled, false) set it to true when clicked on the button and keep the button highlighted, if the active field is already disabled, highlight the button defaultly and then on click remove the disabled attr and unhighlight the button
[02:01:58] <disorder> it seems as a simple problem but I've been stuck for two hours now
[02:02:42] <disorder> unfortunately I don't have a fiddle because my code is too complex (with dinamically created inputs and similar)
[02:03:16] <disorder> anyone have an idea? or a different aproach to this? do you mind if I paste 5 lines of code here?
[02:03:28] <Uhkis> ?paste @ disorder
[02:03:28] <b-ot> disorder: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[02:04:20] <disorder> http://jsfiddle.net/7yL2xfhs/
[02:04:59] <disorder> this is my approach, but I'm failing miserably for now
[02:06:16] <Uhkis> are those wrappers in the html on page load or fetched with ajax?
[02:07:09] <Cork> disorder: don't use .attr for property changes
[02:07:10] <disorder> fetched with ajax
[02:07:15] <Cork> use .prop
[02:08:14] <Uhkis> disorder: so you want to use .on(
[02:08:17] <Uhkis> )
[02:09:03] <Uhkis> disorder: http://jsfiddle.net/7yL2xfhs/1/
[02:09:14] <Uhkis> and fix the typos :D
[02:09:22] <Cork> Uhkis: don't forget the attr use
[02:09:29] <Cork> cause that will break
[02:19:25] <fenris_kcf> hy. is there a way to select the target of jquery-svg's load-method?
[02:22:09] <Cork> fenris_kcf: the target of a method?
[02:22:33] <Cork> fenris_kcf: svg is cross document so you can't traverse into it you need to jump to the new document
[02:22:48] <fenris_kcf> in normal jquery there's "$context.load(url)"
[02:23:20] <fenris_kcf> in jquery-svg there's "svg.load(url, parameters)";
[02:23:36] <Cork> ok so you ajax inject an svg document into an element
[02:23:48] <fenris_kcf> guess so
[02:23:52] <Cork> then ya you would have to target the svg element and then jump from there into the new document
[02:24:16] <fenris_kcf> you mean by moving it?
[02:24:20] <Cork> $context.find('svg').contents().find('search inside the svg document')
[02:24:57] <Cork> but note that this is as separate as if the svg was inside an iframe
[02:25:05] <fenris_kcf> not sure what that is supposed to mean
[02:25:10] <Cork> so you can't have elements in there affect the main document
[02:25:15] <Cork> and events don't bubble and all that
[02:25:53] <fenris_kcf> seems like we talking about different things
[02:25:55] <fenris_kcf> http://keith-wood.name/svg.html
[02:26:34] <fenris_kcf> it load the external svg-content into the svg-root
[02:27:23] <fenris_kcf> *loads
[02:49:23] <stangeland> ok...this is weird...i have variable data. if i do console.log(data) it prints:  {"data": [{"x": [-417.38, -416.364], "y": [-200.0, -200.0]}], "types": [{"type": "line"}]} but if i do console.log(data['types']) it prints undefined.... what am I missing here? why does it not print the types array? why does it print undefined. this is my code: http://pastebin.ubuntu.com/9380718/
[02:49:57] <Cork> stangeland: data is a string not an object
[02:50:12] <Cork> if fix the server to not lie about what it sends and the problem should go away
[02:50:29] <Cork> (the server needs to send Content-Type: application/json
[02:50:36] <Cork> (header)
[02:55:40] <stangeland> Cork, yes you are right...thanks  :)=
[03:17:25] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I told jquery_update to use 1.10, I still see jq 1.5.2 loaded on dev tools
[03:50:57] <Uhkis> Kartagis: js cache?
[03:51:27] <Kartagis> Uhkis: I clear all caches on the site
[03:52:01] <Uhkis> weird
[04:21:21] <Code2Consumer> Hi huys im trying to use ajax with google chrome but i get an error
[04:22:29] <Cork> Code2Consumer: "this error"?
[04:22:36] <Cork> care to share the context?
[04:24:33] <Code2Consumer> XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///C:/Users/Iode/Desktop/arborescence%20xml%20ajax/xmldetest.xml. Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource.
[04:24:59] <Cork> ok, so you're trying to access a local file from a site
[04:25:05] <Cork> and you won't be able to
[04:25:18] <Code2Consumer> from a site ? what does it mean ?
[04:25:24] <Code2Consumer> im using ajax
[04:25:29] <Cork> http(s)://
[04:25:46] <Cork> Code2Consumer: you can't do cross domain calls with ajax
[04:26:04] <root3d> i am in trouble while subsetting the json data , i have Object as but i can't access using["key"] or .key . https://gist.github.com/igauravsehrawat/61fc04d68c10834c854e
[04:26:04] <sacho_> Code2Consumer, why are you trying to access a local file?
[04:26:07] <Cork> and cross domain is if anything differes in protocol://domain:port/
[04:26:15] <root3d> what could be the problem ?
[04:26:44] <Code2Consumer> actually i use this : file:///C:/Users/Iode/Desktop/arborescence%20xml%20ajax/ajaxjquerry.html to acces my file .
[04:26:55] <Cork> Code2Consumer: you can't
[04:27:02] <Cork> you can add an input field
[04:27:05] <Code2Consumer> how should i do then ?
[04:27:09] <Cork> and have it load the data
[04:27:16] <Cork> and then access it with a FileReader
[04:27:20] <sacho_> root3d, some of your elements don't have a tags[0], that's why trying to access tags[0]['tagname] would lead to a typeerror
[04:27:25] <Cork> but you can't access file:// from http://
[04:28:02] <Code2Consumer> I dont realy enderstand what am i suposed to do sorry my english is bad
[04:28:03] <sacho_> Code2Consumer, use a web server
[04:28:16] <Cork> ?mdn FileReader
[04:28:18] <b-ot> Cork: FileReader - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader
[04:28:18] <root3d> sacho_, but it should give error when it process them, starting first 7 objects there is valid data .
[04:28:38] <Cork> Code2Consumer: or as sacho_ says host the file on the same server you load the web page
[04:28:40] <root3d> !mdn FileReader
[04:28:41] <b-ot> root3d: FileReader - Web API Interfaces | MDN - Mozilla Developer Network → https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FileReader
[04:28:47] <sacho_> root3d, say what?
[04:29:04] <sacho_> the *first* result is already undefined, according to your paste
[04:29:10] <root3d> sacho_, i mean there is valid object also, so it should process that atleast
[04:29:22] <root3d> sacho_, ok
[04:29:23] <Code2Consumer> It is on the same serveur :x i mean the code is local and the xml is local
[04:29:30] <Code2Consumer> both are in the samefolder
[04:29:32] <sacho_> root3d, why is that important at all?
[04:29:55] <sacho_> Code2Consumer, there is no server.
[04:30:01] <root3d> sacho_, i have to show the tags at front end, so i have to subset it
[04:30:21] <sacho_> root3d, well check if there is a tag object in the first place.
[04:30:43] <root3d> Code2Consumer, you are currently doing things statically
[04:31:17] <sacho_> Code2Consumer, you're just passing files to your web browser - your web browser isn't connecting to a web server.
[04:31:26] <root3d> sacho_, some have tag object some don't.. so will check with if(tag[0]) and then process it
[04:31:30] <sacho_> so either use a web server or do what cork said
[04:31:38] <Code2Consumer> ah ok so i need to use a local serveur ?
[04:31:53] <root3d> Code2Consumer, yeah , localhost
[04:32:29] <Code2Consumer> the probleme is that i need to use my "aplication" without internet and without installing anythink
[04:33:10] <Code2Consumer> So can we do that withfilereader ?
[04:34:22] <root3d> Code2Consumer, making a request need atleast one server .
[04:34:38] <root3d> either you are or either someone is serving you
[04:34:47] <Code2Consumer> but why is it working with firefow then ? Oo
[04:35:00] <root3d> so you can have your file stored somewhere and make a request to website
[04:35:19] <root3d> Code2Consumer, really?
[04:35:45] <Cork> Code2Consumer: yes you can read local files with filereader
[04:35:55] <Cork> that is what the api was added for
[04:36:38] <Kartagis> I get undefined is not a function in console. I look at it and see .tooltip. googling tells me .tooltip is a jquery-ui function. ctrl+u tells me jquery-ui is loaded, but dev tools > sources tells me otherwise
[04:36:43] <Kartagis> how so?
[04:36:56] <sacho_> Code2Consumer, because browsers have different security levels. I doubt firefox is just letting you access random files, though.
[04:37:12] <Cork> no browser does
[04:37:23] <Cork> if it would allow you it would be a security hole
[04:37:24] <Code2Consumer> So is that a software or a function or a language  ? I m sorry to ask so mush function
[04:37:34] <sacho_> "that"?
[04:38:05] <sacho_> Kartagis, how does dev tools -> sources tell you otherwise?
[04:38:07] <Code2Consumer> well it works with firefox ... jquery + ajax + xml
[04:38:16] <Cork> Code2Consumer: if the source file is loaded from local disk, then firefox will consider all sub folders same scope
[04:38:31] <Cork> but anything above (also including absolute paths) cross origin
[04:39:00] <Cork> *same origin* not same scope -_-'
[04:39:35] <Cork> Code2Consumer: but browsers adds a lot of restrictions for local file access, and you will constantly hit limitations if you go this route
[04:39:46] <Cork> Code2Consumer: an option might be to use the offline cache instead
[04:40:04] <Cork> then you would not have to fiddle with the restrictions of file://
[04:40:50] <Katharsis> which of the methods should I use for bootstrap selectpicker if I need to get all selected option or set list of them?
[04:41:01] <Kartagis> sacho_:  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11918318/Screenshot%20from%202014-12-05%2014%3A38%3A52.png
[04:41:52] <Code2Consumer> how can i use the offline cache ? :O
[04:42:39] <sacho_> Kartagis, what's the jquery-ui script's source url?
[04:42:58] <Kartagis> sacho: ajax.googleapis.com
[04:42:59] <sacho_> Kartagis, most likely, the problem is that the server isn't serving jquery-ui where you expect it to
[04:43:11] <sacho_> well then it wouldn't be in that folder.
[04:43:21] <Kartagis> sacho_: I click on it, and I see it
[04:43:35] <sacho_> It'd be in the ajax.googleapis.com branch.
[04:44:05] <Kartagis> sacho_: so it's normal for dev tools not to list it?
[04:44:12] <sacho_> No.
[04:44:24] <sacho_> Dev tools does list it - but not as part of your files, which it's not.
[04:46:01] <Cork> Code2Consumer: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Using_the_application_cache
[04:46:53] <Kartagis> sacho_: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/11918318/Screenshot%20from%202014-12-05%2014%3A46%3A15.png I can't see it here
[04:47:32] <Code2Consumer> Thanks
[04:47:41] <sacho_> Kartagis, then you haven't loaded it.
[04:47:47] <sacho_> Maybe you have the url wrong.
[04:47:49] <Code2Consumer> that look so hard to understand O.O
[04:50:13] <root3d> sacho_, i updated to handle undefined but still getting erro: https://gist.github.com/igauravsehrawat/61fc04d68c10834c854e scroll down
[04:51:28] <sacho_> undefined !== "undefined"
[04:53:40] <Tomashe> guys i got a prob with jquer mobile, i load pages using ajax and handlebars and then run tigger('create') but it makes a mess in the page, from duplicate pages footers to problems with interface . anyone can help me out ? there is a way to initialize jquery on specific page every time i do load new data programticly?
[04:55:33] <root3d> sacho_, yes, i tried undefined !== undefined but it doesn't work. same error
[04:56:02] <sacho_> you tried what?
[04:56:09] <sacho_> I meant, undefined is not the same as "undefined"
[04:56:19] <sacho_> you're checking for "undefined". You want to check for undefined.
[04:56:20] <root3d> sacho_, my mistake it works.. item.tags[0]!==undefined
[04:56:37] <root3d> sacho_, yeah, string and object .
[04:56:52] <root3d> "hello world" & Object("hello world") are totally different
[04:57:41] <Kartagis> sacho_: that url is valid, I've just checked
[04:57:54] <Kartagis> http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.3/jquery-ui.min.js
[04:58:46] * sacho_ shrugs
[04:58:57] <sacho_> I don't generally like debugging pictures.
[05:00:15] <root3d> Kartagis, you are doing it wrong, that's why you aren't getting right thing, double check or provide more code
[05:03:42] <anli> I am using jcrop_api.setSelect but it seems like the function is undefined, although console.log(jcrop_api.setSelect) outputs bg(a), any ideas?
[05:03:47] <anli> Or should I post some code?
[05:03:57] <anli> :)
[05:05:34] <anli> http://pastebin.com/NGVgbnDj
[05:05:49] <anli> Any ideas are welcome
[05:07:19] <AdamPDotty> maybe not setSelect is undefined but change()?
[05:08:08] <anli> You are maybe right, I only see part of the error message
[05:08:09] <anli> must check
[05:08:52] <anli> AdamPDotty++
[05:08:56] <anli> Thanks
[05:10:15] <anli> I did not even have to call something that triggers an event
[05:10:26] <AdamPDotty> fine
[05:49:46] <jrp> when calling a function, how do i refer to the text of the selected element? e.g. $('#foo').somefunction($(this).text()); doesn't seem to return the element's text
[05:59:54] <trmonk> jrp: I think it depends on the element
[06:00:57] <mento> im working on this little form (for some reason it gives and error on jsfiddle while submitting) but how can i stop the form from posting when both start and to fields are empty? http://jsfiddle.net/2vs8dxpc/
[06:02:07] <trmonk> mento: I think just return false
[06:02:18] <d0de> When creating a constructor, what's a good way to differentiate methods that are intended to be public and methods that are intended as helper functions for the public methods?
[06:02:21] <trmonk> in your fiddle you check one then the other
[06:02:32] <trmonk> but you can obviously check both first
[06:02:36] <trmonk> then return false if they're both empty
[06:02:49] <trmonk> mento: I may be wrong though so test it out
[06:03:00] <mento> trmonk: thanks, i was struggling with e.preventDefault()
[06:03:07] <mento> but that didnt work within the if else statements
[06:03:29] <mento> return false sounds legit, i'm gonna try it
[06:03:45] <trmonk> mento: cool gl :)
[06:04:01] <mento> any tips on checking the fields at the same time?
[06:04:09] <mento> than i can get rid of the double if statement
[06:04:22] <mento> use && ?
[06:04:22] <trmonk> just use &&
[06:04:25] <trmonk> ya
[06:04:35] <trmonk> ((jQuery('#From').val() == '') && (jQuery('#To').val() == ''))
[06:06:58] <mento> but i cant give a nice error using that, i guess?
[06:07:22] <mento> now i'm showing an alert for from date and an alert for to date
[06:07:36] <Sharath_Kurup> info
[06:07:50] <Sharath_Kurup> #jquery
[06:09:19] <trmonk> mento: what would you like to happen?
[06:09:47] <trmonk> it seems to me like you'd probably want to reject the submit if either from or to date was empty
[06:10:32] <trmonk> in which case http://jsfiddle.net/2vs8dxpc/1/
[06:11:26] <mento> http://jsfiddle.net/2vs8dxpc/2/
[06:12:34] <mento> yes, but combining the check to see if the Start and To date fields are empty wouldn't give me the option like the extra if statement does for showing different erros for the From and To field
[06:12:53] <mento> like in your example, thats the way it should be done i guess
[06:14:39] <trmonk> right
[06:14:52] <trmonk> so in my example it could alert the user appropriately
[06:14:57] <mento> yep :)
[06:15:01] <mento> thanks for the help !
[06:15:49] <trmonk> yw!
[06:22:52] <latestbot> How to check if my down key has focused a select element?
[06:26:25] <Kartagis> why would I get "Uncaught Type Error: undefined is not a function" with http://jsfiddle.net/kartagis/eb42yczt/ ?
[06:29:33] <latestbot> @Kartagis: works fine for me
[06:30:09] <trmonk> Kartagis: same here
[06:30:24] <Kartagis> latestbot: it baffles me why I get it on the site
[06:30:32] <Kartagis> trmonk too
[06:31:13] <latestbot> and I think .live() is deprecated now
[06:31:19] <latestbot> you should use .on
[06:31:53] <latestbot> “As of jQuery 1.7, the .live() method is deprecated. Use .on() to attach event handlers. Users of older versions of jQuery should use .delegate() in preference to .live().”
[06:32:01] <Kartagis> latestbot: if only jq version was not 1.5.2
[06:32:23] <latestbot> then probably it’s best for you to upgrade and refactor your code
[06:33:24] <sacho_> Kartagis, what version of jquery are you using?
[06:33:35] <Kartagis> latestbot: do you think I get this error because .live?
[06:33:38] <notchris> Hey guys, I’m trying to get a calendar script working. I’ve included it correctly, I’ve called the calendar correctly, I’m still getting $ undefined.
[06:33:46] <notchris> http://www.ctsciencecenter.org/dev/visit/hours/
[06:33:55] <Kartagis> sacho_: I think 1.5.2
[06:33:56] <latestbot> I am no expert, but that could be the reason
[06:34:11] <sacho_> 1.5.2 has live()
[06:34:18] <Kartagis> sacho_: there was a command to find out, what is it again?
[06:34:47] <Kartagis> jQuery.f something?
[06:35:07] <sacho_> look at your source?
[06:35:32] <notchris> Any ideas?
[06:36:17] <sacho_> well, use a non-minified version of the calendar when testing
[06:36:20] <Kartagis> yea, 1.5.2
[06:37:21] <notchris> Thank you
[06:39:01] <notchris> OK just used the non-minified, still getting $ is undefined
[06:39:13] <notchris> Isn’t that error from jQuery having an issue?
[06:40:04] <sacho_> notchris, it seems like you're using a noconflict jquery
[06:40:17] <sacho_> the calendar assumes $ is jQuery
[06:41:05] <notchris> @sacho_ Ahh, how do I go about fixing that?
[06:41:44] <sacho_> well, you could remove noConflict.
[06:43:11] <Kartagis> sacho_: well, have you got an idea for me?
[06:44:00] <notchris> Ahh
[06:46:00] <notchris> It worked! Although, it was in the native Wordpress jquery file
[06:46:12] <notchris> Which is concerning considering I call it from a CDN and it shouldn’t be using the native one
[06:46:30] <notchris> Unless Wordpress requires it’s native jquery file for specific things
[07:01:14] <latestbot> How to check if my down key has focused a select element?
[07:03:53] <NoiseEee> latestbot: are you sure a better question isn't "how i can i tell if a (particular) <select> element has focus"
[07:09:55] <latestbot> yeah that’s a better question
[07:10:35] <latestbot> Actually I will change it, it’s a bootstrap dropdown
[07:44:18] <ShishKabab> I'm passing an absolute URL to jQuery UI $.autocomplete({"source": "/autosuggest/"}), but the request is going to /?term=bla . Any ideas why?
[08:00:34] <paulvd> hello, i can use stopPropagation with preventDefault ?
[08:00:46] <paulvd> i have a menu with multi level sub menus
[08:00:55] <paulvd> i want to prevent it from going to the top
[08:01:04] <paulvd> and also prevent it from opening children ul's
[08:01:42] <Duvdevan> paulvd: which event are you going to trigger?
[08:03:30] <paulvd> click event
[08:03:45] <paulvd> on a <a href="#">
[08:04:30] <Duvdevan> $('a[href="#"]').click(function(e) { e.preventDefault(); e.stopPropagation(); });
[08:06:37] <paulvd> i tried that but then the links in the sub menu are not working
[08:06:57] <paulvd> actually its a click on li
[08:07:00] <paulvd> i will make a jsfiddle
[08:14:32] <paulvd> ok here it is...
[08:14:32] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/b2y9k02f/1/
[08:15:35] <paulvd> Item 1 in sub menu is linked to google
[08:22:21] <paulvd> is anybody here?
[08:23:08] <paulvd> hello
[08:23:09] <Duvdevan> paulvd wait please
[08:23:12] <paulvd> oh ok
[08:23:45] <Duvdevan> you shoudn't do a "li" click
[08:24:00] <Duvdevan> put a display: block; on your a which is inside your "li"
[08:24:09] <Duvdevan> then do a click on that "a" instead
[08:24:36] <Duvdevan> and this is totaly a bad practice
[08:24:43] <ckb> I know this probably isn't the right place. but does anyone have any idea why google maps won't load up maps when you recenter the window?
[08:24:57] <Duvdevan> you should put your submenu with a new <ul> inside  your <li>
[08:24:58] <paulvd> a already have display block
[08:25:05] <Duvdevan> do as I told you
[08:25:12] <Duvdevan> it will be alot easier just to do
[08:25:32] <Cavallari1> Hi...
[08:25:39] <Duvdevan> $('li a').click(function() { if($(this).find('ul')) { $(this).find('ul').addClass('open'); });
[08:25:41] <paulvd> the sub menu is already in a new <ul> inside the li
[08:25:44] <Duvdevan> do the toggling logic by yourself
[08:25:52] <Duvdevan> oh sorry
[08:25:55] <Duvdevan> I didn't saw it
[08:26:00] <Cavallari1> How can I read the content of <script type="application/json" src = "json/markers.json"></script> ???
[08:26:11] <Duvdevan> do the selector like this
[08:26:22] <paulvd> if click is done on a, then how it find ul inside it ?
[08:26:37] <paulvd> shouldnt it be .parent().find("ul") ?
[08:26:44] <Duvdevan> $(this).closest('ul');
[08:26:46] <paulvd> but that will open all the ul's inside it
[08:26:48] <paulvd> um
[08:26:50] <Duvdevan> you can do a parent too
[08:26:53] <paulvd> ok
[08:26:57] <paulvd> closest looks good
[08:27:40] <Cavallari1> do anybody know my question?
[08:28:23] <Duvdevan> $.get('json/markers.json', {}, function(data) { console.log(data); }, 'json'); Cavallari1
[08:29:00] <Duvdevan> Cavallari1: depends how you want to use the contents of that file
[08:29:17] <Duvdevan> remove 'json' - the last arguument, if you want to get plain text instead
[08:30:59] <Cavallari1> Duvdevan: the json is loaded by <script src="json/markers.json"> not trough ajax
[08:31:40] <Duvdevan> I don't understand your question then
[08:31:43] <Duvdevan> and what you want
[08:31:52] <paulvd> dude its not working...
[08:32:00] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/b2y9k02f/2/
[08:32:12] <Duvdevan> paulvd: tell me again what do you want to achive?
[08:33:12] <paulvd> duv its pretty clear
[08:33:19] <paulvd> clicking on + opens its sub menu
[08:33:32] <paulvd> and then clicking on + inside it, opens its sub menu
[08:33:59] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/b2y9k02f/3/
[08:34:24] <Duvdevan> wait...
[08:34:51] <paulvd> actually closest, it is considering the main ul
[08:35:21] <Duvdevan> sorry I got your thing wrong
[08:35:24] <Duvdevan> I'm editing your fiddle
[08:35:33] <paulvd> nevermind
[08:35:36] <paulvd> i did it
[08:35:44] <paulvd> http://jsfiddle.net/b2y9k02f/5/
[08:35:46] <paulvd> dont do it
[08:35:48] <paulvd> its fone
[08:36:10] <paulvd> done
[08:37:38] <paulvd> hm but the links done open !!
[08:37:38] <paulvd> duh
[08:37:53] <Duvdevan> done?
[08:38:18] <Duvdevan> paulvd: here you go: http://jsfiddle.net/b2y9k02f/8/
[08:38:29] <Duvdevan> slightly better version than yours :P
[08:38:51] <Duvdevan> both anchors and outside links work
[08:38:51] <paulvd> ah cool
[08:39:06] <Duvdevan> but if you don't want to get the "#" stick up in your address bar of your browser
[08:39:37] <Duvdevan> you should filter that too... and add e.preventDefault(); if this.href == "#"
[08:39:43] <Duvdevan> but suit yourself
[08:41:16] <paulvd> ah ok thanks
[08:41:49] <bbclover> hey guys my scrollLeft only works once
[08:41:53] <bbclover> I'm just calling it in my console
[08:43:06] <bbclover> it always scrolls the first time
[08:45:36] <bbclover> oh it's about current offset!
[08:46:51] <babamelone> Hi
[08:47:54] <babamelone> Im having a select input element inside a tablesorter header with sorting enabled. Thus, when I click the select item, the dropdown menu won't appear anymore, instead the table column is being sorted. How can I prevent this behavior?
[08:49:32] <babamelone> I already tried $(some select selector).off(**), but the click handler inherited by the table header is still being called.
[08:49:47] <Duvdevan> babamelone: try overriding it
[08:50:34] <babamelone> how so?
[08:51:07] <babamelone> I already tried $(some select selector).prop("onclick", null), didn't work though.
[08:51:43] <babamelone> by calling .click() you do not override the existing handler, you just add another one
[08:52:22] <robertmaxrees> try adding a new click handler and stopImmediatePropagation() on the event object.
[08:52:29] <babamelone> sth. like .click(function(event){event.defaultAction();}); would be helpful, but I do not know how to achieve that...
[08:52:33] <robertmaxrees> sounds like the event is bubbling up, causing your heaches
[08:52:42] <ckb> Can someone please help me figure out why my simple google maps implementation doesn't like when I recenter it? The map recenters, but shows gray area
[08:53:01] <Duvdevan> try $('body').on('click', 'yourSelector', function() { return false; }); - babamelone
[08:53:16] <Duvdevan> ckb are you using twitter's bootstrap for layouting?
[08:53:25] <robertmaxrees> don't return false from event handlers
[08:53:29] <ckb> No.. bootstrap isn't loaded
[08:53:37] <Duvdevan> robertmaxrees nevermind
[08:53:56] <Duvdevan> let him find the selector and try overriding that inherited function/mmethod
[08:54:07] <Duvdevan> they use the propper prevents and/or stopPropagations
[08:54:08] <Duvdevan> etc
[08:54:25] <ckb> Duvdevan: I've tried manually triggering the resize, and it still won't load
[08:54:25] <ckb> I
[08:54:27] <babamelone> stopImmediatePropagation(); stopped prevented the table from being sorted, but the dropdown menu still won't appear...
[08:55:01] <ckb> Duvdevan: I initially thought it was a bootstrap conflict, however I quickly realized bootstrap isn't being included
[08:56:01] <babamelone> isn't there some function like event.defaultAction()?
[08:56:48] <Duvdevan> e.preventDefault()
[08:56:50] <ckb> return false; does both cancel the bubble and default actions
[08:56:53] <Duvdevan> return true; is default, I think
[08:57:30] <ckb> this map though :(
[08:57:38] <ckb> You want a link, Duvdevan?
[08:57:53] <Duvdevan> hm... I had the same issue when using twitter's bootstrap
[08:58:00] <ckb> See the sites on Wordpress
[08:58:03] <Duvdevan> I think the fix was quite easy
[08:58:06] <robertmaxrees> babamelone not really.
[08:58:10] <ckb> but I don't see bootstrap anywhere
[08:58:19] <Duvdevan> #map_canvas img { width: 100%; }
[08:58:30] <Duvdevan> maybe there's a bootstrap theme
[08:58:32] <robertmaxrees> babamelone default actions run by default.  do you have a fiddle or something showing the problem?
[08:58:56] <Duvdevan> ckb send a link, sure
[08:58:59] <babamelone> no
[08:59:02] <babamelone> but i can make one
[08:59:06] <babamelone> just a few seconds
[08:59:07] <robertmaxrees> babamelone that would be helpful :D
[08:59:11] <ckb> PM?
[08:59:16] <Duvdevan> sure
[09:02:04] <babamelone> sth. like this: http://jsfiddle.net/6g7u90L2/
[09:02:16] <babamelone> although the select is inside a tablesorter table
[09:02:26] <babamelone> but I cannot include the tablesorter plugin into jsfiddle
[09:02:33] <babamelone> or I dont know how to
[09:05:00] <robertmaxrees> the external resources in the left-hand side
[09:06:01] <babamelone> I do not have a link to the tablesorter plugin, it's only zippedly available.
[09:06:17] <_DB> sup guys
[09:06:40] <_DB> im appending data to a div on my document using  +'{{$artobj->object_title}}'+'</div>'
[09:06:53] <_DB> that data im appending also has " and  ' inside of it
[09:07:13] <_DB> is there anyway I can print out the data without escaping the original ' , '
[09:07:56] <robertmaxrees> babamelone so you want the dropdown to work, but not the alert?
[09:08:06] <babamelone> exactly
[09:08:10] <robertmaxrees> is the js inlined like this on the page?
[09:08:18] <babamelone> no
[09:08:31] <babamelone> it's added by the tablesorter plugin
[09:08:52] <babamelone> when Im enabling sorting
[09:09:07] <robertmaxrees> http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6g7u90L2/1/
[09:09:11] <robertmaxrees> something like this, then.
[09:09:35] <notchris> var headerLayer = $('<table class="table header"></table>');
[09:09:44] <notchris> How do I put another variable inside of table header
[09:09:47] <babamelone> yeah, sth. like this
[09:09:54] <notchris> var headerLayer = $('<table class="table header">OTHER VARIABLE</table>');
[09:10:06] <robertmaxrees> notchris $('<table class="table header">' + OTHERVARIABLE + '</table>');
[09:10:13] <notchris> @robertmaxrees <#
[09:10:14] <notchris> <3
[09:10:24] <babamelone> but, robertmaxrees, when the select is inside the tablesorter table header, the dropdown menu doesn't appear
[09:10:45] <robertmaxrees> babamelone i'd have to see what you're looking at in that case, becase I don't know what you mean.
[09:12:39] <csd_> Can someone please explain to me how to move the JSON in <pre> to within the JS as an object? I can't seem to get it to work. http://jsfiddle.net/5mtxekeb/1/
[09:13:45] <babamelone> like this:http://jsfiddle.net/6g7u90L2/2/
[09:13:57] <_DB> is there anyway I can print out the data without escaping the original quotes?
[09:14:04] <_DB> like a prevent string escape function?
[09:14:14] <robertmaxrees> csd_ that's how you do it.
[09:14:38] <csd_>  huh?
[09:14:57] <robertmaxrees> csd_ what you've got there creates an object out of the text() in that pre tag.
[09:15:21] <csd_> i know but i need to move it into the JS code, and when i try to do so i can't get dynatable to render for some reason
[09:15:30] <_DB> +'{{$artobj->object_title}}'+'</div>'   <----- how do i prevent string escape on the '{{PHP OBJECT }}'
[09:15:35] <csd_> seems like it should be pretty easy to do but i cant figure out why its not working
[09:15:39] <robertmaxrees> sounds like the format isn't what dynatable expects, then csd
[09:16:07] <robertmaxrees> babamelone so you still don't want the alert to run in this case?
[09:16:23] <robertmaxrees> but other handlers for the selects to run?
[09:16:33] <robertmaxrees> because http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/6g7u90L2/3/
[09:17:23] <csd_> robertmaxrees: If it can work using data from JSON.parse(<pre JSON>.text()), i don't see any reason why it can't instead be represented within javascript, can you?
[09:17:41] <robertmaxrees> csd_ huh?
[09:17:45] <robertmaxrees> i think you're munging something.
[09:17:50] <babamelone> robertmaxrees, yes i stilldo not want the alert
[09:18:00] <robertmaxrees> babamelone then the code i paste should work fine.
[09:18:40] <louism2wash> Hey guys, if I have a jquery object that is a list of images in the DOM that I got using $('img') is there a way to pull one of those images out and create another jquery object representing that image?  Say like $('img').get(0) and have the result be a jquery object?  Thanks
[09:18:52] <csd_> robertmaxrees: i want to pass a k/v object from chrome.storage into dynatable. so i can't put the data in a <pre> tag. i need to somehow convert the JS object to JSON instead and pass that
[09:19:00] <robertmaxrees> louism2wash you want .eq()
[09:19:20] <robertmaxrees> csd_ then why the rigamorale with the pre tag?
[09:19:40] <Jisan> Hi I need some help with jQuery
[09:19:46] <louism2wash> robertmaxrees: awesome, thanks
[09:19:47] <csd_> robertmaxrees: oh that's not my code, that's demo code from dynatable's docs. i havent worked with it before so i'm starting from something that actually works
[09:20:04] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ Jisan
[09:20:05] <b-ot> Jisan: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[09:20:52] <babamelone> as I told you, inside the tablesorter the select dropdown menu won't appear...
[09:20:55] <robertmaxrees> csd_ aaaah - well for starters your fiddle isn't properly setup...
[09:21:11] <csd_> that's also something i havent used before :)
[09:21:11] <Jisan> one of the divs on a page is scrollable. It scrolls when I put the cursor on that div and scroll using my mouse wheel. I want it to scroll when I scroll using the mousewheel wherever the cursor is
[09:21:12] <robertmaxrees> babamelone sorry then - i have no clue what you want.
[09:21:39] <csd_> what's wrong with the fiddle
[09:21:44] <babamelone> do you know the tablesorter plugin?
[09:21:50] <robertmaxrees> babamelone nope.
[09:22:00] <babamelone> I cannot add it to jsfiddle
[09:22:22] <babamelone> It's a plugin allowing a table to be sorted by their columns
[09:22:26] <Jisan> In short can i scroll a scrollable div using mouse wheel when the cursor is outside that div?
[09:23:05] <robertmaxrees> Jisan sure - you bind to the mouse scroll event on the window and preventDefault(); on the event object, then scroll the div instead.
[09:23:11] <rayken> var $someArr = []; $('div').each(function(){ $someArr = $(this).data('price'); });  -- the question is really how can I add to someArr inside the each?
[09:23:16] <robertmaxrees> babamelone i gathered - without seeing an examle, it's really hard to help.
[09:23:22] <babamelone> once you enable sorting on a column, a click handler is put on the table header
[09:23:26] <babamelone> see here http://tablesorter.com/docs/#Demo
[09:23:46] <robertmaxrees> rayken $someArr.push($(this).data('price'));
[09:23:54] <rayken> ah
[09:23:54] <ckb> anyone have any idea why google maps won't load new parts of the map? I get grey area when recentering the map
[09:24:06] <robertmaxrees> csd http://jsfiddle.net/robertmaxrees/5mtxekeb/2/ see the "external resources"?
[09:24:40] <babamelone> code looks like this: http://jsfiddle.net/6g7u90L2/4/
[09:24:47] <Jisan> robertmaxrees I'm a beginner in jQuery. Is there any plugin to achieve that?
[09:24:50] <robertmaxrees> babamelone are you trying to use dropdowns in the column sorts?
[09:24:54] <csd_> I'm guessing that your way everything loads before the custom js executes?
[09:24:57] <babamelone> in the headers
[09:25:09] <babamelone> so, yes, in the "sorts"
[09:25:16] <robertmaxrees> csd_ in your version, you were trying to load everything via the css panel, which doesn't necessarily make much sense.
[09:25:45] <robertmaxrees> babamelone http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23540016/tablesorter-and-select-dropdown-boxes does this help you?
[09:27:15] <babamelone> no it's not
[09:27:29] <patie> hi i have problem with safari and jquery ajax request to another domain - im using crossDomain: true and withCredentials: true - other browsers works ok - any idea please ? ://
[09:27:29] <robertmaxrees> babamelone okay - just checking.  it's really hard to help in this case because i'm flying blind :)
[09:27:29] <babamelone> in my case there's a select item in each header
[09:28:54] <robertmaxrees> patie any erors in the console or network panel?
[09:29:08] <patie> robertmaxrees i dont see any errors in safari :/
[09:29:24] <robertmaxrees> patie did you try logging out the errors that might be getting thrown?
[09:29:34] <patie> robertmaxrees what you mean please
[09:29:43] <robertmaxrees> patie in the console?
[09:30:00] <patie> but what i need logging i have no idea robertmaxrees
[09:30:18] <robertmaxrees> patie you log out the three options that get passed to the fail handler.
[09:31:13] <robertmaxrees> http://fixee.org/paste/lwfxl0h/ tack this fail handler onto your current ajax call.
[09:35:46] <patie> robertmaxrees thx i go try
[09:36:08] <bbclover> hey guys, how do I scrollLeft based on the current scrollbar position? I tried $('.a').scrollLeft($('.a').scrollLeft() + 215);
[09:36:17] <bbclover> but it only scrolls once
[09:36:58] <patie> robertmaxrees no errors :(((
[09:37:01] <patie> wierd
[09:37:05] <bbclover> .scrollLeft() always happens to be 0...
[09:37:09] <robertmaxrees> patie okay, sounds like something else is broken.
[09:39:23] <patie> im using POST maybe works only with GET or what :/
[09:39:44] <Jisan> can anybody answer me please
[09:39:59] <robertmaxrees> add .done(function(){console.log('hello')}); pastie - do you see this fire in the console?
[09:40:13] <Jisan> i'm trying to make a div scrollable even when the cursor is not on that div
[09:40:30] <robertmaxrees> Jisan what about my explanation didn't make sense?
[09:41:33] <Jisan> robertmxress https://pastee.org/xjq5k
[09:41:45] <robertmaxrees> wat
[09:41:51] <robertmaxrees> no.
[09:41:55] <Jisan> the window is still scrollable
[09:42:00] <robertmaxrees> that's not what i said at all :)
[09:42:11] <robertmaxrees> $('window').on('scroll', function(e) { e.preventDefault() });
[09:42:14] <robertmaxrees> this is what i meant.
[09:42:31] <Jisan> then how do i make that specific div scollable again?
[09:43:19] <robertmaxrees> use something like .scrollTop()
[09:44:14] <robertmaxrees> Jisan though I have to point out that what you're trying to do seems unusual.
[09:45:44] <Jisan> all other contents will be fixed. and some texts in the middle will be scolling from bottom when we will be going down in the page.
[09:46:06] <rayken> How do I Math.round a random number between 1 and 25.000 but it has to round to nearest 50?
[09:46:08] <Jisan> robertmaxress check this out http://nimbus.devslate.com/heritage/
[09:47:14] <Jisan> place cursor on the texts under the year line. it's scrollable. i removed the scroll bars using css
[09:47:32] <robertmaxrees> Jisan sounds like you want the page to be scrollable, just add a div that "hides" the appropriate content and let the window scroll do its thing.
[09:47:42] <babamelone> robertmaxrees: look at this:http://jsfiddle.net/BKgue/368/
[09:47:49] <babamelone> I've edited an existing tablesorter fiddle
[09:48:24] <robertmaxrees> rayken get the random number, then http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14484908/round-up-to-the-nearest-multiple-of-12
[09:50:37] <Jisan> robertmaxrees sounds like a good idea. but how the browser will show it again?
[09:52:09] <babamelone> robertmaxrees: I have resolved the problem now
[09:52:13] <robertmaxrees> babamelone this plugin is doing something really strange.
[09:52:15] <robertmaxrees> what was the fix?
[09:52:28] <babamelone> had to pass cancelSelection:false to the tableserter() function
[09:52:34] <robertmaxrees> hah there you go :)
[09:52:40] <babamelone> nonetheless, thanks for your help
[09:52:51] <babamelone> needing to find an example did the trick^^
[09:55:11] <latestbot> I am using QUnit, how can I make sure the key event happened?
[09:56:18] <pentagrass> If I'm calling a bind() operation on an element, and that bind call is within a loop (i.e.: while(1){ $("#foo").bind( ... )) Does that create a new handler each iteration?
[09:58:37] <robertmaxrees> pentagrass yes.
[09:58:49] <robertmaxrees> also, if you're using a newer version of jquery, use .on() instead :)
[09:59:15] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: thanks dude
[09:59:20] <robertmaxrees> fsho
[09:59:25] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: why use .on?
[09:59:54] <robertmaxrees> per http://api.jquery.com/bind/ - "As of jQuery 1.7, the .on() method is the preferred method for attaching event handlers to a document."
[10:00:40] <pentagrass> robertmaxrees: I imagine it takes the same args as bind?
[10:00:57] <robertmaxrees> sorta.
[10:01:10] <robertmaxrees> the docs show you more.
[10:02:05] <bbclover> can I create a dom element and then add a click function to it on the next line?
[10:02:25] <bbclover> Cause I create this element, it's here, but my .click doesn't do anything. I even added a console.log to print something when it's clicked
[10:02:34] <robertmaxrees> bbclover show us your code :)
[10:02:35] <bbclover> I can select it in my console, though
[10:03:26] <bbclover> http://pastebin.com/CWzuzFU6
[10:03:57] <robertmaxrees> are there multple elements with that ID?
[10:04:30] <robertmaxrees> also - use event delegation instead in cases like this.
[10:04:44] <pentagrass> If I use .on() can I specify multiple events? -> $("#foo").on("click change blur"); ???
[10:05:10] <robertmaxrees> pentagrass http://api.jquery.com/on/ tells you.
[10:05:11] <robertmaxrees> :)
[10:05:32] <pentagrass> doh
[10:05:44] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: I do $('#contScroll').length; shows 1
[10:05:54] <pentagrass> I'm on the page but skimmed it for examples which didn't show it could. But I should have just read the argument list at the top
[10:06:15] <robertmaxrees> bbclover that'll always return one because jquery assumes your document is compliant
[10:06:21] <robertmaxrees> pentagrass :)
[10:06:55] <robertmaxrees> bbclover $('[id="contScroll"]').length - try this.
[10:07:30] <bbclover> O.O there are errors
[10:07:35] <bbclover> It says 4
[10:07:37] <bbclover> HAHA
[10:07:41] <robertmaxrees> bbclover there's your problem ;)
[10:07:57] <bbclover> so even if there are 4 it won't do the click
[10:07:59] <bbclover> even if I click 1
[10:08:09] <robertmaxrees> no - it's only binding to the first one.
[10:08:21] <robertmaxrees> because it's assuming that your document is valid.
[10:08:31] <robertmaxrees> you can only have a given ID once per page.
[10:09:46] <robertmaxrees> use a class instead of an ID, and use event delegation instead of directly binding.
[10:29:09] <ckb> anyone really familiar with google maps?
[10:29:59] <robertmaxrees> !ask @ ckb
[10:30:00] <b-ot> ckb: If you have a question, please just ask it. Don't look for topic experts. Don't ask to ask. Don't PM! Don't ask if people are awake, or in the mood to help. Just ask the question straight out. http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html
[10:30:02] <robertmaxrees> !paste @ ckb
[10:30:05] <b-ot> ckb: Please paste your code at http://jsfiddle.net/ [preferred], http://jsbin.com/ or http://fixee.org/
[10:30:18] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[10:32:08] <ckb> sigh. http://jsfiddle.net/oy2fa544/ here's my google maps implementation. Whenever I recenter my map, I get gray boxes and the rest of the map won't load.
[10:32:58] <ckb> even with a simple map integration, this happens.
[10:36:59] <Snerf> ckb, dont bother with a resize command , just set #map-holder css to size
[10:38:38] <ckb> I've changed the style of #map-holder and removed my resizes, and unfortunately, recentering does nothing but move the currently rendered map with gray area on the new areas
[10:39:04] <ckb> Ironically enough, when I change the zoom of the map, it renders the map area
[10:39:26] <ckb> but then when I recenter it again, grayarea..
[10:58:16] <notchris> Are json files often in php documents?
[10:58:20] <b100s> hi2all
[10:58:36] <notchris> or often php documents rather
[10:58:41] <b100s> does someone know plugin for search in table?
[10:58:47] <b100s> just on frontend
[11:10:00] <ckb> google maps shows gray area on recentering the map. the original map rendered is still visible, but the new areas don't. can anyone help?
[11:13:58] <checkit> Hey guys... I'm having a difficult time figuring out why my click even on .js-box-enabled isn't firing. Any guidance? http://jsfiddle.net/c3rLLhb0/2/
[11:16:08] <hwamokp66> http://memorytree.hpcreatives.net/  i see a jumble of text and objects flash for a second before my page loader comes on. How do i hide that ? It kind of defeats the purpose of the page loader
[11:19:40] <Robdgreat> ckb: for starters (and I can't yet explain this) $('.sj-box-enabled') has length 0
[11:21:19] <Robdgreat> ckb: DERP. your classes are sj-box-*
[11:21:21] <Robdgreat> not js
[11:21:49] <Robdgreat> ckb: sorry, meant checkit
[11:23:02] <checkit> Robdgreat: triple hyphen is the problem!?
[11:23:16] <Robdgreat> no, your classnames in the script don't match in the markup
[11:23:35] <Robdgreat> your onclick is js-box-enabled
[11:23:44] <Robdgreat> your element class is sj-box-enabled
[11:23:53] <checkit> Oh oh
[11:24:22] <checkit> Okay... That was just an accident.
[11:24:48] <checkit> The real issue is when you select the first item from the drop down. The first div elm is enabled but the click event doesn't work on it...
[11:24:59] <Robdgreat> you need to use delegation
[11:25:05] <Robdgreat> like
[11:26:03] <Robdgreat> $('.js-box-group').on('click', '.js-box-enabled', function() { console.log('test'); });
[11:26:33] <Robdgreat> you hang the click off of the parent element and it then watches for instances of the target class
[11:26:50] <Robdgreat> otherwise newly created members of the class won't get the event
[11:28:02] <checkit> Robdgreat: No kidding.. I was never aware of this approach. Thank you very much.
[11:28:11] <Robdgreat> I only just learned about it in the last month or two
[11:28:18] <Robdgreat> welcome
[11:29:28] <gmcinnes> guys I'm looking at some code like $('.foo').on('click', '.dropdown', function(e) { … });
[11:29:39] <ckb> Snerf: I found out it's a conflict with css
[11:29:46] <gmcinnes> Is there any reason that shouldn't be catching "Enter" keypresses?
[11:30:08] <gmcinnes> I mean, it's not, but I can't see *why* not.
[11:32:37] <Robdgreat> gmcinnes: my guess would be because the mouse isn't getting clicked
[11:32:55] <Robdgreat> it's on click, not on change
[11:33:24] <csd_> Can anyone recommend a library for displaying data in a table and that supports easy deletion + insertion of rows?
[11:34:10] <Robdgreat> csd_: you might try datatables, but don't expect support for it in here. It's pretty arcane and few people know much about it
[11:34:30] <ckb> handlebars is pretty nice, csd_. It's not EXACTLY what you're looking for, but it allows for customization
[11:34:59] <csd_> Robdgreat: I started thinking I'd be able to use dynagraph but it doesn't do insertion/deletion and I'm wondering whether trying to add it is more trouble than just doing everything on my own
[11:35:18] <Robdgreat> datatables api supports insertion/deletion
[11:35:19] <gmcinnes> Robdgreat: Interesting. I expected since pushing enter on a link you tabbed to follows that link, the browser was mapping it to a click event
[11:35:44] <Robdgreat> gmcinnes: I think it just follows the link
[11:35:58] <csd_> ok ill check both of those libs out, thx Robdgreat and ckb
[11:36:12] <Robdgreat> I'll need to have a look at handlebars sometime
[11:37:14] <gmcinnes> Robdgreat: well, that seems to be what's happening. So I'll need to check for 'click' and 'keypress' and then check the keyCode.
[11:37:22] <gmcinnes> Robdgreat: what low level monkeying around we do :)
[11:37:30] <Robdgreat> indeed!
[11:38:02] <csd_> ckb: am I asking for trouble using handlebars with requirejs?
[11:38:16] <ckb> Never tried to the 2 together
[11:44:23] <bbclover> hey guys, if I create an element of a certain id which has display: none; css, $('#a').show() doesn't seem to display it
[11:44:31] <bbclover> I'm creating the element with jquery
[11:45:06] <robertmaxrees> bbclover and it's the only element with that ID? :)
[11:45:17] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: I think so
[11:45:18] <bbclover> hahaha
[11:45:30] <bbclover> It's not. for god sakes
[11:45:33] <bbclover> what's going on here
[11:46:32] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[11:47:02] <bbclover> I made it better though. Now only 2 are here
[11:47:08] <robertmaxrees> lol
[11:47:13] <robertmaxrees> you can only have 1.
[11:47:27] <bbclover> yeah
[11:49:29] <bbclover> I'm about to .get(0).show()
[11:49:39] <bbclover> code thinks it can mess with me
[11:49:42] <bbclover> I'll show it
[11:50:57] <bbclover> It's not working. Always 2. None of them are shown. I just want to show 1!
[11:51:12] <robertmaxrees> right.
[11:51:25] <robertmaxrees> fix your duplicated ID problem.
[11:51:48] <robertmaxrees> also - .get() returns raw DOM nodes, not the jquery-wrapped ones.
[11:53:47] <Robdgreat> your elements are Sith?
[11:54:02] <robertmaxrees> hahahhaa
[12:00:32] <coder7of9> when using colorbox inline it duplicates the html from the target div and this creates multiple elements with the same id.  must i use ajax
[12:01:05] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[12:01:11] <robertmaxrees> ajax has nothing to do with that.
[12:02:13] <theweirdn8> so is there a way to make anchor links to be higher than teh actual link on click?
[12:02:26] <coder7of9> if i use ajax there will be only one copy of a div in the page
[12:02:42] <robertmaxrees> coder7of9 do you have a fiddle of what you're trying to do?
[12:02:52] <coder7of9> not
[12:03:05] <coder7of9> i kind of answered my own quetion
[12:03:07] <coder7of9> thx
[12:04:10] <coder7of9> basically if ai use colorbox inline the elements in the hidden div are duplicated for the colorbox popup and if i use an ajax call as a source there will only be a single copy
[12:04:25] <coder7of9> an id must be unique in the page
[12:12:35] <latestbot> Is there any I can check if #firstelement is focused on keydown? http://jsbin.com/qimugudule/4/
[12:24:07] <spudzee> why doesn't this seem to work? $('#FONT11').css({'text-align':'center','left':'0'});
[12:25:23] <spudzee> making a jsfiddle
[12:25:26] <spudzee> ...
[12:27:14] <spudzee> okay, I found the issue, nvm
[12:29:14] <bbclover> it seems this code: $('.ui-coding-panel-display-content').before($('<a href="#" id="contScroll">Continue</a>')); is creating that <a> twice
[12:29:27] <bbclover> and I don't know why
[12:33:32] <BillCriswell> spudzee: #FONT11... sounds like a fun code base.
[12:33:49] <spudzee> not bad, eh?
[12:34:19] <spudzee> I'm not great at naming things
[12:34:33] <spudzee> I'm trying to center my text
[12:34:47] <spudzee> the 'left' attribute is the problem I assume
[12:35:01] <spudzee> how can I nullify its effects?
[12:35:19] <BillCriswell> spudzee: left: auto; ?
[12:35:27] <spudzee> let me try that
[12:36:45] <spudzee> still doesn't seem to work
[12:37:23] <spudzee> jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/n1220rL0/
[12:37:42] <spudzee> I'm thinking it probably has something to do with that position:absolute
[12:38:15] <BillCriswell> Yeah, you'd need right: 0;.... but what you're doing seems way overcomplicated.
[12:38:23] <BillCriswell> or width: 100
[12:38:24] <BillCriswell> %
[12:39:59] <spudzee> SUCCESS!
[12:40:13] <spudzee> \o/
[12:43:28] <_DB> whats the best way to write text into a div?
[12:43:29] <_DB> document.getElementById('comments').innerHTML = comment;
[12:43:29] <_DB> ?
[12:43:37] <_DB> im using jquery btw
[12:47:40] <NoiseEee> then use jquery
[12:47:45] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/t8vjvyaz/
[12:47:50] <NoiseEee> $('#comments').text(comment)
[12:47:54] <_DB> idk what to use when I use append
[12:48:10] <coder7of9> which is more efficient appending raw html which contains all my inputs or creating each input using the dom and appending them?
[12:49:39] <_DB> ahh
[12:49:42] <NoiseEee> coder7of9: efficient how.  certainly it's nice and 'efficient' to say $('someReference').append(htmlString)
[12:49:46] <_DB> is append only for inputs?
[12:49:54] <coder7of9> yes
[12:50:00] <coder7of9> hideen inouts
[12:50:07] <coder7of9> *hidden
[12:50:09] <NoiseEee> _DB: append is for adding things to the DOM
[12:50:32] <_DB> when I appended my div  with a variable it turned it into an input
[12:50:44] <NoiseEee> then you made a mistake somewhere
[12:50:56] <_DB> I posted the code..
[12:51:19] <_DB> http://jsfiddle.net/t8vjvyaz/1/
[12:51:30] <NoiseEee> what about that
[12:51:43] <_DB> that turns my empty div into a input
[12:51:49] <_DB> I already have it work but I used text()
[12:53:07] <NoiseEee> _DB: i don't know what slider() is
[12:53:22] <_DB> its a plugin I have
[12:53:27] <NoiseEee> _DB: well great
[12:53:56] <NoiseEee> but appending a "value" to a <div> is uh, interesting to say the least. it looks like you should brush up on your JS
[12:54:11] <NoiseEee> _DB: your sample if of little use to trying to figure out what you're doing
[12:54:12] <rubyonrailed> How do I make this slide left?  `$('#stripe-form').toggle("slide");`
[12:54:57] <_DB> well I was under the impressions I was grabbing the value and appending that
[12:55:16] <_DB> I just need to show the value as you slide the bar left or right
[12:55:47] <NoiseEee> and whats not working about it _DB?
[12:56:25] <_DB> it turns the div into a text input lol, well I mean it works now but like I said I had to use .text instead of .append
[12:56:51] <NoiseEee> .text() is proper - you're updating the value/contents of a <div>, you're not appending new things to it
[12:57:13] <NoiseEee> turning the <div> into a txt input means something somewhere is screwy, but you'd need to create a working fiddle to debug it
[12:59:44] <_DB> I see
[13:05:02] <Cyclohexane> is there a simple way of removing >=3 <br />'s following one another?
[13:08:35] <robertmaxrees> probably a series of .next() calls or something?
[13:09:16] <Pyche> hi, been searching.. cant find working solution.  I have code on b.com that is presented as an iframe on a.com. How can I set links within the frame open in the parent window or a new window? the link would be b.com/page2 ?
[13:10:22] <robertmaxrees> huh?
[13:10:40] <robertmaxrees> you mean you want to edit stuff that's in the iframe?
[13:11:20] <robertmaxrees> from the parent window?
[13:12:09] <Pyche> no
[13:12:29] <Pyche> just want links in iframe to open in a parent window or new window
[13:12:38] <Pyche> right now all links open in the iframe
[13:12:48] <Pyche> i can edit code within the iframe
[13:13:44] <robertmaxrees> target="_blank" and target="_parent"
[13:13:53] <robertmaxrees> former is a new window, former is the parent window.
[13:14:00] <Pyche> those dont work
[13:14:11] <spudzee> I have an img, this image's width is always going to be larger than the page. I don't want any overflow in the horizontal direction. Is there anyway to do a sort of pseudo crop on the image so that it only shows what can fit on the page?
[13:14:26] <robertmaxrees> Pyche are you sure you're using them correctly?
[13:15:11] <Pyche> No :)
[13:15:18] <Pyche> thanks for helping me
[13:15:20] <Pyche> i wasnt
[13:15:25] <robertmaxrees> there you go :)
[13:15:37] <Pyche> <a link> was to form submission..
[13:15:39] <spudzee> now on to my problems \o/
[13:15:42] <Pyche> didnt target the form..
[13:15:49] * Pyche fish slap
[13:15:50] <spudzee> jk, I'm not that self absorbed
[13:15:55] <robertmaxrees> spudzee ask in #css?
[13:16:07] <spudzee> I did, but they didn't seem to have an answer
[13:16:24] <robertmaxrees> it'd be some kind of centered background image i'm guessing
[13:16:25] <Pyche> i remember on mirc you used to do some thing like /me slap or something and it would "hit you with a fish"
[13:16:37] <Pyche> i remember on mirc you used to do some thing like ./me slap or something and it would "hit you with a fish"
[13:16:53] <bbclover> $('.ui-coding-panel-display-content').before($('<a href="#" id="contScroll">Continue</a>')); seems to create this <a> twice guys... any idea?
[13:16:54] <robertmaxrees> it's a right-click comment
[13:17:24] <robertmaxrees> bbclover you're either calling the code twice or have two .ui-coding-panel-display-content
[13:17:47] <bbclover> OH SWAT
[13:17:50] <bbclover> that's probably it!
[13:18:02] <robertmaxrees> ;)
[13:18:09] <robertmaxrees> this is why you avoid using IDs in cases like this.
[13:20:46] <bbclover> I did $('[class=".ui-coding-panel-display-content"]').length and got 0
[13:21:06] <bbclover> so I tried adding that <a> with that command I pasted above and the next .length gave me 2 again
[13:21:12] <bbclover> on id='contScroll'
[13:23:18] <js__> hola
[13:23:31] <js__> alguien que me pueda ayudar a resolver este problema
[13:24:41] <robertmaxrees> bbclover except that the class attribute can have more than one class in it ;)
[13:25:06] <js__> como puedo hacer para que por cada 3 elementos de 9 de un div.contenido tenga diferentes clases
[13:25:12] <bbclover> robertmaxrees: so how would I check how many elements have at least that class
[13:25:15] <robertmaxrees> and the attribute wouldn't have a period.
[13:25:26] <robertmaxrees> $('.ui-coding-panel-display-content').length
[13:25:38] <bbclover> without a period I get 2 :(
[13:25:44] <robertmaxrees> right.
[13:25:46] <bbclover> I just want to add it to one of them though
[13:26:00] <robertmaxrees> when looking at classes, use a normal class selector.
[13:26:04] <robertmaxrees> then pick the one you want?
[13:26:22] <js__>  as I can do so that for every 3 elements 9 of a div.contenido have different classes
[13:27:56] <js__> help ?
[13:28:21] <robertmaxrees> js__ huh?
[13:28:30] <Robdgreat> google translate fail I think
[13:29:15] <robertmaxrees> js__ we didn't understand your question.
[13:29:17] <Robdgreat> How can I make every 3 elements out of 9 of a div.contenido have different classes
[13:29:20] <Robdgreat> I think
[13:30:01] <Robdgreat> js__: como .a .a .a .b .b .b .c .c .c ?
[13:30:11] <js__> yes
[13:31:30] <Robdgreat> still don't understand
[13:31:55] <Robdgreat> js__: puedo ver html?
[13:32:48] <Robdgreat> <div class="contenido"><div class="a"></div><div class="a"></div> ...</div>
[13:33:10] <Robdgreat> hmmm
[13:33:16] <Robdgreat> derp, programmatically
[13:33:35] <robertmaxrees> it'd be an iterator
[13:33:36] <Robdgreat> how to assign classes programmatically in groups of 3
[13:33:38] <Robdgreat> yeah
[13:34:33] <js__> Robdgreat http://jsfiddle.net/2k15wzvz/
[13:34:44] <js__> must be dynamic the content
[13:34:56] <robertmaxrees> js__ why?
[13:35:03] <robertmaxrees> i mean, why are you grouping them like that?
[13:35:52] <js__> different dimensions in css
[13:36:06] <js__> of class
[13:36:08] <robertmaxrees> are you trying to make a grid layout or something?
[13:36:19] <robertmaxrees> otherwise, you should probably do this in your backend if possible.
[13:37:50] <js__> may be 9 or fewer items
[13:38:05] <robertmaxrees> still smart to do server-side instead.
[13:39:28] <js__> jquery ?
[13:41:00] <js__> is possible
[13:42:12] <robertmaxrees> yes, but not preferred.
[13:43:58] <js__> :( yes, but not preferred
[13:44:07] <js__> in php like ?
[13:46:12] <js__> an example in php?
[13:46:22] <robertmaxrees> Ask in ##php
[14:36:12] <spudzee> how do I force center the $(window) within a div so that the window's distance from the right of the div is the same as the distance from the left of the div
[14:36:44] <robertmaxrees> you... don't?  the div is in the window, not the other way around.
[14:37:02] <spudzee> that's the point though, the div is going to be much larger than the window
[14:37:25] <robertmaxrees> okay, so you want the div to always be 400px wider than the window?
[14:38:10] <Robdgreat> and extending the same distance to the left as to the right
[14:38:18] <Robdgreat> past the window boundaries
[14:38:27] <robertmaxrees> right - so the div is centered and always 400px wider than the window :)
[14:38:52] <Robdgreat> I don't think setting the width is at issue
[14:38:56] <spudzee> if it is 400 px larger than the window, I want the distance from the right of the window and the right of the div always to be half of  $(div).width() - $(window).width()
[14:39:21] <robertmaxrees> right - you want the div centered and 400px wider
[14:39:31] <spudzee> not 400px wider
[14:39:35] <spudzee> just centered
[14:39:47] <Robdgreat> it's already some arbitrary amount wider
[14:39:59] <spudzee> yes
[14:40:20] <robertmaxrees> sorry, i was in #css when you originally asked the question.
[14:40:25] <robertmaxrees> that's where i got the 400px from..
[14:40:40] <spudzee> yeah, someone told me it was more of a jquery question
[14:43:38] <robertmaxrees> you could always set something like left: -(($(div).width() - $(window).width()) / 2)
[14:43:46] <robertmaxrees> or whatever.
[14:44:24] <spudzee> okay, so what is the $() going to be? $(window) ?
[14:44:38] <robertmaxrees> on the child div.
[14:45:03] <spudzee> like $(window).css(($(div).width() - $(window).width()) / 2)
[14:45:06] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:45:13] <spudzee> hm
[14:45:14] <robertmaxrees> like $(window).css(($(div).width() - $(window).width()) / 2)
[14:45:14] <robertmaxrees> [2014:12:05:14:45:06] <robertmaxrees> no.
[14:45:16] <robertmaxrees> err, woops.
[14:45:40] <Robdgreat> 16:44 [ robertmaxrees] on the child div.
[14:45:41] <robertmaxrees> something like $(div).css('left', -(($(div).width() - $(window).width()) / 2))
[14:45:55] <robertmaxrees> you're also missing the negative part of that.
[14:46:17] <spudzee> why does it need to be negative?
[14:46:29] <Robdgreat> because you want the left side to the left of the window
[14:46:36] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:46:56] <spudzee> so we're pushing the div instead of the actual window?
[14:46:59] <robertmaxrees> yes.
[14:47:02] <Robdgreat> positive will put it that many pixels within the window, which isn't what you want
[14:47:06] <Robdgreat> you can't position the window
[14:47:08] <spudzee> right]
[14:47:09] <Robdgreat> it's not an html element
[14:47:11] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:47:18] <spudzee> yeah, yeah, that makes sense
[14:47:41] <spudzee> I didn't consider moving the actual div. That's actually a pretty good idea
[14:47:59] <robertmaxrees> gets back to my original point :)
[14:48:03] <robertmaxrees> the width is arbitrary.
[14:48:11] <robertmaxrees> but you want to position the div relative to its container in this case.
[14:48:12] <spudzee> okay
[14:48:26] <robertmaxrees> what is this for?
[14:48:37] <spudzee> a picture
[14:48:55] <spudzee> I'd tried doing a thing with background-whatever, but it really didn't work
[14:48:55] <robertmaxrees> why does the div need to always be larger than the window, i mean?
[14:49:43] <Robdgreat> use case is generally helpful for a complete answer
[14:49:48] <spudzee> I'm trying to make my site mobile ready
[14:49:57] <robertmaxrees> so you want responsive picutres>?
[14:50:26] <spudzee> I think
[14:50:30] <robertmaxrees> https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill
[14:50:38] <robertmaxrees> for browsers that don't support it yet.
[14:51:00] <robertmaxrees> instead of hacking together your own solution :)
[14:53:44] <cambazz> hello, when using jquery validate, after user enters a sequence of characters in input (iban) i want to strip it from whitespace and reput the value into form?
[14:55:10] <robertmaxrees> cambazz bind a listener to the focusout on that element, grab its value, strip whitespace, and set its val() to the new string.
[15:30:36] <HowardwLo> hi! what would be the best way to have a floating bar at the bottom of the window, that attaches itself to the top of the footer once the footer appears?
[15:30:41] <HowardwLo> I’m trying to find an example
[15:31:28] <kevireilly> HowardwLo: not sure if it is the best way, but a way that comes to mind is a position: fixed; element that gets changed to position: absolute; with coordinates derived from the footer, when the footer comes into view
[15:31:32] <HowardwLo> here is a decent example: https://www.salesvu.com/bundles/restaurants-bars.php
[15:31:54] <HowardwLo> kevireilly: coordinates? never did that before
[15:32:17] <HowardwLo> can jquery tell “when footer come sinto view” ?
[15:32:24] <kevireilly> HowardwLo: yeah, you should be able to get the offset of the element. I think it is simply $(el).offset();
[15:32:50] <kevireilly> I believe so, there are a crap load of "in view" plugins and what not, though I'm not sure how they go about it and it might vary
[15:34:33] <HowardwLo> kevireilly: i’d like to do it from the ground up so I can learn and keep it lightweight
[15:34:37] <HowardwLo> any idea what hte function is called?
[15:34:44] <kevireilly> HowardwLo: in the past I did a crappy implementation that goes based on the scroll position matching that of the element position, definitely not sure if this is the best approach available
[15:34:48] <HowardwLo> or i guess, i’d have to compare offset with window position?
[15:34:59] <kevireilly> yeah that is probably one approach
[15:35:14] <HowardwLo> i feel like there is a more slick way, but not sure what its called :)
[15:35:30] <kevireilly> I know that one plugin is called inview specifically, but i've come across like 5 in the past couple weeks
[15:40:50] <HowardwLo> kevireilly: got it, thanks
[15:42:51] <kevireilly> HowardwLo: no problem
[16:20:18] <HowardwLo> humbug! I’m having an issue I cant figure out
[16:21:15] <HowardwLo> i have a fixed bar at the bottom of the screen that attaches to the top of the footer when the footer comes into view, but it blinks
[16:21:28] <HowardwLo> i’m assuming becuase when it attaches to the footer, the position of the footer changes
[17:13:09] <blackkbot> change the css position to fixed when it comes into view?
[17:13:23] <blackkbot> well that took a while lol
[17:15:19] <blackkbot> no... idk why would you attach something when it comes into view at the bottom of a page... why not just have it there all the time
[17:24:27] <guideX> I'm doing something wrong here, but what?!     console.log($(this).attr("data-uniqueid")); .... <input type="button" class="button saveButton cmdDeleteProductSpecification" value="Delete" data-uniqueid='<%#Eval("UniqueId") %>' /> .. for that, i get the whole input
[17:26:49] <HowardwLo> blackkbot: so that its always visible, but above the footer
[17:27:02] <HowardwLo> blackkbot: i think i got it sorted out…..kind of :|
[17:27:16] <HowardwLo> now trying to figure out how to grab the position of an element and see if its “fixed” or “relative"
[17:27:45] <blackkbot> getComputedStyle(element).position
[17:27:55] <guideX> the rendered version is .. <input type="button" class="button saveButton cmdDeleteProductSpecification" value="Delete" data-uniqueid="89">
[17:29:25] <HowardwLo> thanks :)
[17:33:43] <guideX> so any ideas how to properly use attr? I seem to be using it wrong
[17:36:11] <Robdgreat> a bot trigger saying to use .prop and not .attr when someone says .attr would be funny
[17:36:40] <Robdgreat> would save robertmaxrees  a lot of typing :]
[17:37:14] <Robdgreat> guideX: not really, I don't know when it's still appropriate to use .attr
[17:37:21] <guideX> oh
[17:37:35] <guideX> is there a better option? I'm trying to get the data-blah="3" type thing
[17:37:39] <Robdgreat> I just know I keep seeing in here to use .prop instead
[17:37:44] <Robdgreat> ohhhh
[17:37:45] <Robdgreat> use .data
[17:38:00] <Robdgreat> .data('blah')
[17:38:14] <guideX> I don't understand .prop, when I try to use it, it's always undefined
[17:38:20] <guideX> like the value I'm trying to get
[17:38:29] <guideX> usually attr works best... let me try data...
[17:38:29] <Robdgreat> data fields have their own method
[17:38:41] <Robdgreat> data is specifically for your use case
[17:39:04] <guideX> also is undefined
[17:39:43] <Robdgreat> that doesn't make sense
[17:39:51] <guideX> I don't know, those newer methods rarely work, I'm usually using older jquery's
[17:40:03] <guideX> usually either jquery 1.5.1 or jquery 1.7ish
[17:40:07] <Robdgreat> yuck
[17:40:43] <guideX> it's usually simpler to just use attr, as not all sites support these newer methods
[17:41:39] <Robdgreat> I keep mine up-to-date
[17:41:48] <Robdgreat> so I'm able to use whatever is most appropriate
[17:41:57] <guideX> easier said than done, with very large projects sometimes it's not practical
[17:42:13] <Robdgreat> ok
[17:42:17] <guideX> also asp.net packages jquery 1.5.1 with every site, sometimes it's not as simple as swapping it out
[17:44:54] <Robdgreat> because who wants to use a version that's much less than 4 years old
[17:45:02] <Robdgreat> way to go, microfail
[17:45:28] <z1haze> can someone  please explain how I would validatea  form before the fadeout() runs?
[18:05:03] <limbera> hi guys
[18:05:44] <limbera> i have this code: http://dpaste.com/3MDXXMS
[18:06:03] <limbera> but all it returns is undefined :/
[18:06:43] <limbera> but when i browse to the url that the get request is for, i can see the objects
[18:07:27] <BillCriswell> limbera: Do console.log(data) and make sure it has a name property.
[18:07:40] <limbera> when i do console.log(data)
[18:07:42] <limbera> it just logs
[18:07:43] <limbera> [Object]
[18:07:54] <limbera> this is the JSON object that is returned
[18:08:04] <blackkbot> console.log(JSON.stringify(data))
[18:08:07] <limbera> http://dpaste.com/386SSTN
[18:08:27] <BillCriswell> limbera: Ok, so it's retuning an array.
[18:08:36] <BillCriswell> You need to do data[0]['name']
[18:08:41] <limbera> ahhhh i see
[18:08:44] <limbera> i missed the [ ]
[18:08:46] <limbera> thank you Bull
[18:08:49] <BillCriswell> limbera: I do too.
[18:08:54] <limbera> BillCriswell *
[18:09:04] <BillCriswell> limbera: No problem.
[18:52:59] <Sal> hi
[18:53:13] <Sal> whats the best way to ajax some html code?
[18:53:56] <Sal> i'm now using $.ajax
[18:54:15] <Sal> what i neexd to do is to call a server php file and receive some html code
[18:54:47] <Sal> is $.ajax the best way or is there something "more used"
[18:57:16] <andrew9183> yes or $.get
[18:57:21] <Sal> $.load?
[18:57:25] <Sal> what about that?
[18:57:35] <andrew9183> try it and see
[18:57:36] <andrew9183> !
[18:57:54] <Sal> ok, thanks
[19:24:07] <z1haze> will someone PLEASE help me with validating a form using jquery and then fading it out? Mine is just fading out every time submit is clicked - whether its validated it not
[19:24:31] <z1haze> its not posting if its incorrect - but i want the window to remain in position if it didnt pass validation - so it can be corrected
[19:46:55] <z1haze> this channel blows - ive NEVER gotten a repsonse from it .. why does it exist
[19:51:03] <shoky> z1haze: make a jsfiddle showing your problem, ask an actual question that someone else can understand, be nice, and be patient
[20:03:38] <BillCriswell> z1haze: The way you're asking we'd have to guess too much about your setup. Show us some code so we know for certain what you have going on.
[20:04:01] <z1haze> im trying to get something decent to show you
[20:04:01] <BillCriswell> z1haze: Lots of people get a lot of help here.
[20:04:29] <z1haze> ive honestly asked like over a dozen times over the weeks - never gotten a single response - all different issues of course
[20:09:40] <BillCriswell> I rarely see questions go unnoticed here unless they're easily answerable or too broad.
[20:10:40] <BillCriswell> Your best bet is to just ask the question as simply as possible with a simple fiddle.
[21:01:01] * CssNoob good afternoon y'all
[21:01:10] * Bryzzle good evening
[21:05:22] <stephen> what up Noobs
[21:36:26] <Snerf> just adding a captcha to the login window stops most bots
[21:56:28] <Yahkob> I recently noticed a bootstrap theme that uses jQuery to transition on anchor clicks to that section of the page
[21:56:40] <Yahkob> the origin author wrote bind clicks to the element
[21:56:57] <Yahkob> hold on actually let me get a jsbin
[21:58:25] <Yahkob> http://jsbin.com/nasohodemo/1/edit
[21:58:37] <Yahkob> Would this be a less elegant solution to change it to a click?
[21:59:05] <Yahkob> The problem is if you use something like OAuth with express it redirects to the page then the element is no longer bound
[21:59:44] <Yahkob> kind of a noob question but what is the draw back of modifying it this way?
[22:01:52] <Yahkob> as far as i can tell bind('click') and .click() are the same right?
[22:02:55] <Yahkob> aside from the fact you know bind clicks to the body
[22:03:43] <Yahkob> now* hah terrible spelling tonight..
[22:08:28] <Yahkob> I guess my question now that I really thought about it is how much worse is it to $('body').click('element',func) than $('element').click(func) because in some cases it is absolutely necessary
[23:03:30] <ohaibbq_> Yahkob: why is it absolutely necessary?
[23:03:52] <Yahkob> sometimes $(element) is there after the dom renders
[23:03:58] <Yahkob> like if you appended an element
[23:04:08] <Yahkob> you couldnt say $(element).on('click')
[23:04:25] <Yahkob> its not there until the client decides it there.. how can you bind to something not in the DOM
[23:04:39] <ohaibbq_> sorry i read what you said wrong, yeah, on('click', 'element') will work even for dynamically added elements
[23:04:50] <Yahkob> right
[23:05:09] <Yahkob> but is it more expensive to bind to the body?
[23:05:19] <Yahkob> every time you click the body it listens and checks if its that element
[23:05:23] <Yahkob> is that how it works?
[23:05:42] <Yahkob> or does it not fire unless its that specific element? just wondering how jQuery works under the hood
[23:06:34] <ohaibbq_> i think it'd technically be more expensive, but not practically
[23:06:41] <ohaibbq_> you know about event bubbling, ya?
[23:07:21] <ohaibbq_> http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-delegation/#event-propagation
[23:07:51] <Yahkob> ah yeah
[23:07:56] <Yahkob> kind of what i thought
[23:08:11] <Yahkob> i wanted to know how pissed this guy is going to be when i pull request his repo with it on the body instead of element :P
[23:08:49] <Yahkob> i mean obviously he doesnt have to merge it
[23:08:54] <Yahkob> but im wondering how hard he will flame me
[23:08:59] <Yahkob> and for what reason.. i wanted to prepare for it
[23:09:22] <ohaibbq_> i don't see why he would flame
[23:10:24] <Yahkob> yeah.. just some people on github sometimes ya know ohaibbq_
[23:10:29] <Yahkob> not open to new ideas :|
[23:10:30] <ohaibbq_> it is a bit of a silly change to randomly PR for, but its not like its a crazy change
[23:14:41] <Yahkob> well i mean it is a legitimate bug if you try to use oauth
[23:14:50] <Yahkob> or redirect from the server ya know ? ohaibbq_
[23:15:08] <ohaibbq_> ah, then its fine for sure
[23:15:19] <ohaibbq_> then i especially don't see why he'd flame :p
[23:18:56] <Yahkob> >:)
