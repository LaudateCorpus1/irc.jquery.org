[17:22:53] <z1haze> if i use async in the .submit() callback.. and i want to return false.. do i throw an exception and .catch() the .submit()?
[17:57:44] <phelix> Why would I be getting an "Uncaught TypeError:" With this piece of code? if(('.step-1 .panel-title').attr('aria-expanded') === 'true') {
[17:58:03] <robertmaxrees> ('.step-1 .panel-title').attr('aria-expanded') isn't doing anything.
[17:58:07] <phelix> if I console log this I get the value of that attribute. Why can't I run an if on wheather this exists or not?
[17:58:09] <robertmaxrees> you need a $ in front of it.
[17:58:16] <robertmaxrees> $('.step-1 .panel-title').attr('aria-expanded')
[17:58:18] <phelix> ohh crap
[17:58:44] <phelix> Well that fixed it. Damn, can't believe i missed that. I need some sleep lol
[17:58:56] <robertmaxrees> :)
[18:02:05] <robertmaxrees> in those cases, always look at the next part of the error.
