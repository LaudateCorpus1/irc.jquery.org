[02:24:25] <devi8> Can someone explain why the expand function is not firing sequentially? https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/YYowNP?editors=1111
[02:40:30] <Cork> devi8: fires sequentially to me...
[02:41:08] <Cork> though i would prob write expandNext as (function expandNext(i) {})(0); instead of what you have
[02:41:27] <devi8> what do you mean?
[02:42:10] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/em23m538/
[02:42:49] <devi8> what does that do?
[02:43:18] <Cork> the same as what you did before just in a more coherent way
[02:43:30] <Cork> function expandNext(i) {} defines a named function
[02:43:54] <Cork> (function expandNext(i) {})(0) executes that named function and passes it 0
[02:44:11] <devi8> but that creates a garbage collection issue, I thought.
[02:44:16] <Cork> no
[02:44:20] <devi8> oh
[02:44:22] <Cork> why would it=?
[02:44:25] <Cork> *?
[02:44:42] <Cork> as soon as the function ends the block is gc:ed as nothing references it
[02:44:50] <Cork> same as the rest in javascript
[02:45:33] <devi8> I thought that was why we used var instead...my bad.
[02:46:07] <Cork> var just means you change the declaration to a statement and the function is stored as a value in a variable
[02:46:31] <pavonia> Does ist make a difference if the function is named or not in that case?
[02:46:35] <pavonia> *it
[02:46:37] <Cork> also the function is unnamed in the var expandNext = function() {}; case
[02:46:39] <devi8> I've never seen a function defined the way you did. I'll have to wrap my head around it and see if I can apply it
[02:46:51] <Cork> pavonia: if you want to call it from inside, yes
[02:47:14] <pavonia> Right
[02:47:32] <Cork> devi8: (function expandNext(i) {})(0); is IDENTICAL to function expandNext(i) {} expandNext(0);
[02:48:17] <Cork> well expect that the function name doesn't exist outside the ()(0); in the first case :)
[02:50:08] <Cork> devi8: damn sorry i did a typo in my jsfiddle
[02:50:17] <Cork> that will infinitly loop :x
[02:50:43] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/em23m538/1/ fixed version
[02:52:57] <devi8> the collapse function isn't working right. Now, if you click on one of the elements then collapse it's parent. it stops when it crosses a "checked" element
[02:52:59] <Cork> also for definition description https://jsfiddle.net/43eLvm51/1/ might help clarify the differences
[02:55:12] <devi8> sinking in...thank you. I am starting to see the advantages
[02:57:28] <Cork> anyway
[02:57:30] <Cork> devi8: https://jsfiddle.net/em23m538/3/
[02:58:26] <devi8> not sure why it's not working....
[02:58:34] <Cork> it is with the later one
[02:59:00] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/em23m538/4/ slowed down
[02:59:14] <devi8> not here. if I click on page 2 (turns red) then collapse pages, page 2 should be the only thing showing.
[02:59:35] <Cork> uh
[02:59:45] <devi8> and expand doesn't work at all.
[02:59:46] <Cork> the collapse and expand isn't bound to those elements though...
[03:00:03] <Cork> its bound to #source_content
[03:00:15] <devi8> #source_content is the click handler.
[03:00:37] <devi8> it calls the functions on the li (header) which iterates its children
[03:00:43] <Cork> ah, you use e.target
[03:00:46] <Cork> that is a bad idea
[03:00:50] <Cork> use delegation
[03:00:57] <devi8> I thought that was delegation
[03:00:59] <devi8> one click handler
[03:01:00] <devi8> lol
[03:01:11] <Cork> on('click', 'li', func) is delegation
[03:01:25] <Cork> you check e.target and it will be the lable not the li
[03:01:28] <Cork> *label
[03:02:06] <devi8> sure, that's why I use "$(e.target).closest("li")" because I also handle input element clicks there.
[03:02:14] <devi8> but I can do a separate delegation for inputs
[03:02:27] <devi8> and eventually there will be a "details" button
[03:03:09] <Cork> devi8: i meant all that code could be replaced with https://jsfiddle.net/em23m538/5/
[03:03:17] <Cork> (99 to end)
[03:03:29] <Cork> opps missed to replace the li
[03:03:36] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/em23m538/6/
[03:04:35] <devi8> Cork, I think you are missing what I am trying to do. I want an accordion like thing that when the "headers" are collapsed, the selected content is still displayed.
[03:04:58] <devi8> so if you have three pages selected and collapse the Pages header, those pages remain
[03:05:11] <Cork> hmm, i'm looking at what the code you have do
[03:05:18] <Cork> and ya, that is a bit from what it could do
[03:12:25] <Cork> devi8: so this is what you're trying to do? https://jsfiddle.net/em23m538/7/
[03:13:08] <devi8> precisely...thanks. I'll figure out what you did differently.
[03:14:40] <Cork> devi8: i added a return;
[04:50:11] <davidleon> when i use $("#myele").load("somepage"),the newly loaded page's javascript library messed up with my page's library
[04:50:15] <davidleon> how to avoid this?
[04:50:58] <davidleon> currently i have an idea of loading another empty page which reloads all the javascript library of the original page
[04:51:03] <davidleon> is that the only solution?
[04:58:06] <Cork> davidleon: when you load content with .load it should be a partial page; meaning it should only contain what you want to load into the current page not the full page with header and everything
[04:59:44] <pokmo> hi
[04:59:47] <davidleon> Cork: any other ideas?
[05:00:08] <Cork> not really, your loading things you don't want and that will mess things up
[05:00:21] <pokmo> suppose i have in the DOM several elements with an attribute 'foo', is there a way to somehow force $('foo') return 0?
[05:00:23] <Cork> it will also waste bandwidth and processing time on both server and client
[05:00:41] <Cork> pokmo: attribute foo?
[05:00:48] <Cork> as in <elm foo=""> ?
[05:00:49] <pokmo> without modifying the DOM elements
[05:01:25] <pokmo> Cork yeah. or for instance, <img... hidden>
[05:01:27] <davidleon> Cork: the page i load is troublesome to create another without any library
[05:01:44] <pokmo> and make $('hidden') return 0 without modifying the elements
[05:01:48] <Cork> pokmo: $() never returns a number so what exactly are you trying to do
[05:01:57] <pokmo> oh sorry
[05:02:02] <pokmo> i mean []
[05:02:07] <pokmo> the length being 0
[05:02:11] <davidleon> how to achieve that without recreating the page
[05:02:30] <davidleon> i mean load another page and everything is contained just in that frame or such
[05:02:54] <Cork> davidleon: 1. use $.ajax and regex filter the content before loading it into the page, 2. proxy it over another server script that does the same
[05:03:24] <Cork> pokmo: so you want to select on the attribute, but not get the elements that matches?
[05:03:33] <Cork> pokmo: is it ok to modify the selector?
[05:03:42] <davidleon> i don't get the 2nd solution
[05:03:57] <pokmo> Cork yeah that's right. no, the selector remains intact
[05:03:57] <davidleon> u mean the server side striping the content?
[05:04:06] <pokmo> is there a way to overload/overwrite $?
[05:04:12] <Cork> davidleon: fetch /ajax/partial.php?url=real/url.html and it strips it down
[05:04:13] <davidleon> that basically the same and some nondesireable effect
[05:04:25] <Cork> pokmo: not really in a useful manner
[05:04:54] <Cork> davidleon: then use version 1
[05:04:55] <pokmo> Cork basically i'm trying to get around this anti adblock script. it checks for elements hidden by my adblock
[05:04:55] <davidleon> because the page i load relies on some special css and javascript lib, which is not compatible with the original container page
[05:05:01] <Cork> davidleon: or an iframe instead of ajax
[05:05:09] <pokmo> it checks using $('[hidden]')['length'] > 0
[05:05:11] <Cork> ya, sounds like you need iframe
[05:05:18] <davidleon> would iframe mess up the javascript library?
[05:05:31] <pokmo> so i wonder if i could keep those hidden elements hidden and just foo the script
[05:05:32] <Cork> the page loads completely and basically independent of the current page
[05:05:34] <davidleon> i need everything constained in the container
[05:05:39] <Cork> there is no mixing at all
[05:05:50] <davidleon> can i put iframe in a div?
[05:05:56] <Cork> you don't need to, but sure
[05:06:10] <Cork> just do <iframe src="url"></iframe>
[05:06:21] <Cork> and set how big you want it to be
[05:06:39] <Cork> pokmo: not without modifying the selector
[05:06:54] <Cork> or at least modifying the result value in the script
[05:07:43] <Cork> pokmo: $() is basically just a wrapper around document.querySelectorAll, and the selector you use is going straight to the dom
[05:07:53] <davidleon> umm iframe solves the problem perfectly
[05:08:02] <davidleon> how to hide the iframe frame UI
[05:08:06] <davidleon> iframe is a bit ugly
[05:08:22] <Cork> davidleon: just remove the border, think of it exactly like you handle inputs
[05:08:38] <davidleon> don't know how to remove the border..
[05:09:10] <Cork> davidleon: then i recommend reading https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS
[05:18:27] <pokmo> Cork right
[05:20:07] <scetian> Hi guys. I have an iframe on a page. I want to get a particular value that is consoled in that iframe. Any ideas how to do that?
[05:27:43] <Cork> scetian: is the iframe from the same domain as your page?
[05:33:54] <scetian> is there any way to customize audio player icons ?
[05:34:05] <scetian> something that I can do using css?
[05:34:26] <scetian> sorry wrong channel :P
[05:34:37] <scetian> Cork: no its not on the same domain
[05:34:50] <Cork> scetian: then you can't
[05:35:13] <Cork> not unless that site has an api you can request the info from
[05:35:32] <Cork> (you could proxy the request to your own domain and fetch it from there)
[05:35:43] <scetian> Okay... I tried something like this but it didn't work:
[05:35:44] <scetian> iframe.contentWindow.console.addEventListener("log", function (value) { console.log.apply(null, value); });
[05:39:23] <Cork> ya, you can't reach into the iframe
[05:39:33] <Cork> as it is cross domain so the interface is blocked by the browser
[05:39:40] <Cork> that is why i said "you can't"
[05:42:47] <scetian> yep thanks :)
[06:09:18] <pokmo> i have an element <img ... style="display: inline"> but window.getComputedStyle('<img...')['display'] returns none
[06:09:21] <pokmo> does anyone know why?
[06:09:26] <pokmo> shouldn't it return 'inline'?
[06:09:45] <Cork> pokmo: you don't need to use [] for accessing normal properties on an object
[06:09:55] <Cork> you can just do .display
[06:10:04] <pokmo> oh, sure
[06:10:35] <pokmo> the display value is set in the script to 'inline'
[06:10:40] <pokmo> is the computed style cached?
[06:12:12] <Cork> pokmo: https://jsfiddle.net/pskznkdo/
[06:12:25] <Cork> i hope you didn't give the html to getComputedStyle :)
[06:12:32] <Cork> cause ya that won't work
[06:13:21] <pokmo> Cork actually yeah it's the html
[06:13:39] <Cork> pokmo: then you get the error return from getComputedStyle
[06:13:52] <Cork> it isn't a value of any element
[06:14:36] <Cork> actually, i'm not sure why you didn't get an exception instead...
[06:14:54] <pokmo> oh, i meant i agreed with you. i had a typo in my example
[06:14:59] <Cork> you should have gotten something like "VM301:1 Uncaught TypeError: Failed to execute 'getComputedStyle' on 'Window': parameter 1 is not of type 'Element'."
[06:15:42] <pokmo> Cork see that's the thing. the DOM had display: none to begin with (hid by adblocker)
[06:16:07] <pokmo> then my tampermonkey script changes the value from "none" to "inline"
[06:16:10] <Cork> pokmo: you can't work around an adblocker by modifying the pages css
[06:16:30] <pokmo> but getComputedStyle still gives none even when the input html contains 'inline'
[06:16:34] <Cork> the adblocker rule runs in chrome space
[06:16:44] <Cork> ya, cause the adblocker forces the state
[06:17:09] <pokmo> Cork hmm but i'm stepping through the script and the html contains 'inline' now
[06:17:17] <pokmo> does the script not see the change though?
[06:17:24] <Cork> sure, the style attribute value is
[06:17:32] <Cork> but not the elemets style
[06:17:41] <Cork> (those two are not the same)
[06:18:45] <pokmo> Cork but doesn't getComputedStyle return the style attribute value?
[06:19:00] <Cork> no it returns the computed style of the element
[06:19:08] <Cork> the state of the element, not the value of an attribute
[06:19:21] <pokmo> state.. nasty..
[06:19:24] <Cork> that would be elm.getAttribute('style')
[06:19:35] <pokmo> yet, if i change the height value, it gives me the updated value
[06:19:41] <Cork> pokmo: not really, you are forgetting that browsers work with dom, not html
[06:20:05] <Cork> and the dom is state, not html
[06:20:38] <Cork> simplified html is a delivery markup for transmitting a starting state over the network
[06:20:43] <Cork> after it has been parsed it has no meaning
[06:21:49] <pokmo> Cork my TM script sets the same image's height to 30px, yet getComputedStyle().height gives 30px
[06:22:06] <pokmo> so how come height works but not display
[06:22:18] <Cork> cause again the adblocker forces the display value
[06:22:45] <pokmo> hmm so once the adblocker forces the value, it can't be changed?
[06:22:48] <Cork> it normally don't force the height, some rare rules do
[06:22:54] <Cork> ya
[06:23:19] <pokmo> by force, isn't it simply setting the attribute value of the DOM element?
[06:23:24] <Cork> think of it as an !important rule that runs in the user state (before the pages css runs)
[06:23:28] <Cork> no
[06:23:31] <pokmo> right
[06:23:46] <pokmo> is it a mechanism to prevent the remote script from re-displaying the ads?
[06:24:11] <Cork> that for one, but it is also a need way for simplicity and security
[06:24:17] <pokmo> right
[06:24:22] <Cork> else it would have to inject it self into the page
[06:24:34] <Cork> and then the page can detect it, and in some cases even get access to priviliged code
[06:24:59] <Cork> so it is much safer to just generate a style sheet and add the rules there to block what needs to be blocked
[06:25:06] <pokmo> then, this site checks if any ad is set to display: none, is there a way to hack around it in a TM script?
[06:25:20] <Cork> depends on the browser
[06:25:21] <pokmo> since setting display to 'inline' won't do
[06:25:29] <pokmo> i'm working in chrome right now
[06:25:43] <Cork> then i think no, they don't have before js execution events
[06:25:56] <pokmo> how about safari?
[06:26:10] <Cork> the only i know have it (others might) is gecko based browsers
[06:26:19] <pokmo> right
[06:26:53] <pokmo> then i guess i'll need to have to ad whitelisted first and hide it later...
[06:27:06] <pokmo> but it's ugly :(
[06:27:25] <Cork> ya, or rewrite the rule so it doesn't trigger the detector
[06:27:43] <Cork> there are workaround rule scripts for adblockers
[06:27:59] <Cork> might be as simple as to just make sure your rules are updated
[06:28:15] <Cork> anyway this is the event i talked about https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events/beforescriptexecute
[06:28:19] * Cork afk
[06:28:22] <pokmo> Cork yeah, i've tried hijacking the detector function
[06:28:27] <pokmo> but the function name keeps changing
[06:28:39] <pokmo> the script is probably regenerated periodically
[06:44:34] <mauzilla> Hi all! So I'm getting an xml response which I would like to display formatted in my HTML page. I figured I would show the xml in a textarea (or in a div) but it's returned without any formatting (shows the \n\n characters and no formatting). Is there any good plugins anyone can recommend to display xml?
[07:11:04] <Cork> pokmo: it is prob that they just generate the function name on each load
[07:11:12] <Cork> blocker scripts tend to do that
[08:34:18] <evanesoteric> (11:54:10 PM) evanesoteric: Could someone please advise me on how to get a map marker to display using Gmaps.js?:  https://hastebin.com/buvopojavu.php
[10:34:55] <pokmo> is there a way to disable click on an img in side <a>?
[10:36:16] <taplar> you don't want a click on the image to trigger the link?
[10:36:58] <pokmo> that's right. i've tried $('img')[0].click(false) but in console, but it just clicks the link
[10:37:12] <Cork> depend on if you want to prevent click events or the following of the link
[10:37:30] <pokmo> Cork i can make do with preventing click event
[10:37:44] <taplar> i'm assuming he wants to stop the propagation on the image
[10:37:57] <Cork> $('img').click(function(e) { e.stopPropagation(); });
[10:38:40] <pokmo> hmm it just loads the link when i enter it in console
[10:39:02] <taplar> i'm also curious if the css thing to kill mouse interactions would also work
[10:39:02] <taplar> though i guess with that the click would hit just the link itself
[10:39:26] <Cork> no as if you prevent that it would mean you click the link
[10:39:39] <Cork> as it doesn't kill events just makes the element ignored
[10:40:00] <Cork> pokmo: might be cause they have click events bound on the img element
[10:40:08] <Cork> and then you don't have a way to prevent it
[10:40:47] <pokmo> Cork don't think so. if i remove the parent <a> it's no longer clickable
[10:41:05] <pokmo> well, if i redefine 'href' it's no longer clickable
[10:41:39] <pokmo> is .click(false) supposed to disable clicking?
[10:41:42] <Cork> no
[10:41:43] <pokmo> clicking on the img
[10:41:56] <Cork> it is meant to fire the click handler with false as the first argument
[10:42:02] <pokmo> right
[10:42:02] <taplar> can you make a fiddle showing your issue?
[10:43:41] <pokmo> taplar Cork here it is https://jsfiddle.net/e6eeh3kd/
[10:43:45] <taplar> are you doing the .click() to test if the stop propagation works?
[10:43:52] <pokmo> i'm trying to prevent clicking
[10:43:56] <pokmo> without changing the html
[10:44:12] <Cork> lol time to clean out the computer https://imgur.com/gallery/jWqgjiY
[10:44:32] <taplar> no due
[10:44:32] <taplar> *dude
[10:44:33] <Cork> pokmo: you added [0]
[10:44:45] <Cork> https://jsfiddle.net/e6eeh3kd/1/
[10:44:59] <Cork> [0] makes it use the raw dom element
[10:45:03] <taplar> you have to use either on() or click() on the jQuery object to bind the event handler, or onclick or addEventListener on the DOM element
[10:45:14] <taplar> domElement.click(thing) is invoking the click event, not binding a handler
[10:45:22] <Cork> well except onclick doesn't bind :)
[10:45:26] <pokmo> Cork right. but your version still clicks
[10:45:50] <pokmo> right
[10:46:01] <taplar> @thedirtypc  dang
[10:46:13] <pokmo> but then what's this about? https://stackoverflow.com/a/4589973/233798
[10:46:44] <taplar> i've had some dust bunnies, but never that bad
[10:46:44] <taplar> that fiddle doesn't include jQuery
[10:47:35] <pokmo> taplar oops. i've included it now, but still the same
[10:48:24] <pokmo> https://jsfiddle.net/e6eeh3kd/4/
[10:48:32] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/e6eeh3kd/5/
[10:48:34] <Cork> pokmo: ya cause you want to stop the following of the link not the event action https://jsfiddle.net/e6eeh3kd/3/
[10:48:36] <taplar> guess you have to stop both of them
[10:49:10] <Cork> that is why i asked about that before
[10:49:26] <pokmo> oh right
[10:49:30] <Cork> also stopPropagation() is often dangerous, so try to not use it if you can
[10:49:42] <pokmo> thanks a lot
[10:50:11] <taplar> i guess i'm confused.  i thought stopPropagation cancelled the bubbling
[10:52:14] <Cork> it does, but not the default action
[10:52:26] <Cork> it prevents javascript from ever seeing the event again
[10:52:30] <Cork> basically
[10:52:42] <Cork> preventDefault() stops the default action
[10:52:45] <pokmo> is this only doable in jquery? how about javascript?
[10:52:53] <taplar> jQuery is javascript
[10:53:00] <Cork> pokmo: this has very little to do with jquery actually
[10:53:20] <pokmo> cool
[10:53:25] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/e6eeh3kd/6/
[10:53:32] <Cork> pokmo: document.querySelector('img').addEventListener('click', function(e) { e.preventDefault(); })
[10:57:56] <poboy> I'll fill out the markup if it will help, but can someone tell me why the div #bk_processor disappears when I run this code?  I can see the select dropdown and options when I view source, it's just not being displayed
[10:58:05] <poboy> https://jsfiddle.net/h0vuws66/
[10:58:31] <taplar> view source doesn't not reflect the dom
[10:58:50] <taplar> inspect an element to bring up the developer tools
[10:58:50] <taplar> *does not
[10:59:02] <taplar> double negative there, :s
[10:59:20] <taplar> i need coffee
[11:00:48] <poboy> so it's not in the dom.  ok
[11:22:58] <poboy> lmao.  always an issue with bootstraps' selectpicker.  :)
[11:34:51] <poboy> so now my question is, how do I correctly append var test to var selectList?  I need to wrap my select box within this div.  https://jsfiddle.net/h0vuws66/1/
[12:37:13] <devi8> Can you use a variable to store an animation queue that you can call at any time to fire a sequence of animations?
[12:54:48] <robertmaxrees> oontz oontz oontz
[13:01:02] <devi8> So can I use the .queue method to setup two queues on an element that I can call later?
[13:01:58] <markh> @devi8 - have you tried it yet?
[13:02:09] <devi8> I'm trying it with little success.
[13:02:19] <markh> what have you tried, let's see the code
[13:03:37] <devi8> gimme a second to clean it up. here is what I was working on (ignore the font-size issues--that was an experiment). https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/YYowNP?editors=1111
[13:14:19] <devi8> I added the queue attempt at the end and commented out the other stuff.
[13:29:24] <devi8> https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/YYowNP?editors=1111
[13:30:21] <devi8> I initialize the queues for the animations and store the queue names in the header elements. Each step dequeues the queue, firing the previously queued function. at the end, I dequeue the named queue on click.
[13:30:23] <devi8> doesn't work
[13:57:23] <devi8> markh, here's another example of an attempt at using queues to force sequential animation: https://codepen.io/Devi8in/pen/YYowNP?editors=1111
[13:57:27] <devi8> doesn't work.
[14:01:28] <devi8> advice is tricky on here. Wish I hadn't gone down this rabbit hole. I'm going back to doing it the old fashioned way. Thanks for your help.
[14:20:18] <reypm> hi there, I am trying to uncheck a checkbox by finding the closest TR and then the closest CHECKBOX but is not working here is an example of what I have https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/mo89q0n9/ can any help me?
[14:23:36] <robertmaxrees> reypm huh?
[14:23:42] <robertmaxrees> you have one checkbox there.
[14:23:50] <robertmaxrees> $(this) is the checkbox within that each.
[14:24:07] <reypm> robertmaxrees, that's only an example but could be more than one
[14:24:20] <robertmaxrees> so you want to uncheck all to-uploads that are checked?
[14:24:52] <reypm> robertmaxrees, give me a sec I will add more checkboxes so you can picture the whole thing will be better for you to understand
[14:26:01] <Cork> i think the base problem is a misunderstanding of what .closest() does (it doesn't search "around")
[14:26:05] <robertmaxrees> ^
[14:26:16] <robertmaxrees> also: 'checkbox' is not a valid selector.
[14:26:37] <Cork> :checkbox is though :)
[14:26:42] <robertmaxrees> right.
[14:29:31] <reypm> robertmaxrees, here https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/mo89q0n9/1/
[14:29:52] <robertmaxrees> heh
[14:30:06] <robertmaxrees> so you want to uncheck all .to-uploads that are checked, right?
[14:30:52] <robertmaxrees> reypm
[14:31:01] <reypm> robertmaxrees, kind of, the thing that you are not seeing there is that I am making an AJAX call and then based on the result I should keep the checkbox checked or unchecked that's why I think to use the `row` if possible
[14:31:25] <robertmaxrees> so
[14:31:34] <robertmaxrees> you don't need .closest9) within that each
[14:32:05] <robertmaxrees> you can literally just do $(this).prop('checked', false);
[14:32:15] <robertmaxrees> but also: you could get rid of that each entirely.
[14:32:49] <reypm> I will create an empty fiddle with the whole function so you can see what I am doing
[14:32:56] <robertmaxrees> duder
[14:32:56] <robertmaxrees> lol
[14:33:02] <reypm> no?
[14:33:25] <robertmaxrees> what am I saying that doesn't make sense>?
[14:33:27] <robertmaxrees> this is basic...
[14:33:51] <Cork> if you want to store and restore the state of the checkboxes cross replacing the elements, just store the data-form or something like that in an object with the checked as a bool
[14:34:07] <Cork> then just loop over it and set the state from it
[14:34:30] <Cork> you have quite a bit of dom searching here that just isn't needed
[14:37:30] <reypm> robertmaxrees, coming from you anything will make sense always but you are not seeing the whole picture, so let's say by default all of them are not checked, I pick some of them and hit a button, that button does something on the backend and some data is coming back, with that data I am turning the TR into green or red but also I will need to uncheck the previous checked or at least those that are turned in green
[14:37:50] <reypm> here is the whole function https://jsfiddle.net/reynierpm/cd8jL6qe/ maybe that makes more sense that what I have provided
[14:38:42] <Cork> reypm: that was exactly what he told you how to a moment ago...
[14:40:00] <reypm> Cork, I am seeing what he said now, $(this) is the checkbox itself but I still need the each loop didn't I?
[14:40:12] <Cork> no
[14:40:26] <Cork> .find('').prop('checked', false) would do exactly the same thing
[14:40:54] <reypm> Cork, ok let me try
[14:41:16] <Cork> most (close to all) jquery functions loop over the full set of elements in a jquery set
[14:50:24] <alexises> Hello, I should be dumb, I have a click event on tr. I would like to get the content of the first td that matched the call
[14:50:36] <alexises> I need something like  data = $(e.target).closest("tr").text()
[14:51:30] <alexises> arf : $(e.target).closest("tr").("td:first").text()
[14:58:59] <Cork> alexises: "that matches" what?
[14:59:10] <Cork> just the first td in the tr?
[14:59:30] <Cork> if yes then just $(this).children().first()
[15:02:37] <Cork> alexises: https://jsfiddle.net/wdz70sjg/
[15:06:13] <alexises> hum, I check on my code if I correctly understend
[15:07:43] <alexises> just that I need, thanks :)
[18:25:46] <yuta> hello
[18:26:55] <yuta> i have an html page which is using jquery to modify the content. the html is encoded in base64 server side and showed into a div into the html page, and another scripts decodes the base64 html and put its into body inner html
