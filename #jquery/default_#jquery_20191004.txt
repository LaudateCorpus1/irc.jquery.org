[12:03:01] <jak2000> hi all
[12:04:06] <jak2000> var wRenglon = $(this).closest("tr");     i have a class named: ".myEditarPedido" that have a checkbox, my question is how to get state? i try: wRenglon.find(".myEditarPedido").checked but not work..... undefined any advice?
[12:04:35] <jak2000> a friend say me that query selector can do it, how to? document.querySelector('.myEditarPedido')?
[12:26:45] <shoky_> jak2000:  .prop('checked')
[12:34:07] <weijunli> can jquery interact with an input tag like automatically getting a dir to display imgs, or anything of that kind?
[14:01:39] <weijunli> anyone?
[14:02:05] <robertmaxrees> i just joined, lemme look at the logs weijunli
[14:02:14] <weijunli> can jquery interact with an input tag like automatically getting a dir to display imgs, or anything of that kind?
[14:02:22] <robertmaxrees> what do you mean by that?
[14:02:33] <robertmaxrees> "automatically getting a dir to display imgs" meaning...?
[14:03:12] <weijunli> get all images on a directory using the input tag but everything done dynamically, perhaps with jquery or any other frameowkr
[14:03:22] <robertmaxrees> erm.
[14:03:32] <robertmaxrees> that's a server-side thing, not client-side
[14:03:45] <weijunli> robertmaxrees, I'm trying to do this on file:/// scheme
[14:03:47] <robertmaxrees> not sure what the input tag has to do with anything.
[14:03:59] <robertmaxrees> the browser can't arbitrarily read directories.
[14:04:07] <robertmaxrees> that would be very dangerous if they could.
[14:04:16] <robertmaxrees> you need to provide a list of files to the browser somehow.
[14:04:27] <weijunli> robertmaxrees, everything is done locally on file:/// scheme
[14:04:31] <weijunli> and the images are also on file scheme
[14:04:32] <robertmaxrees> that doesn't change anything.
[14:04:43] <robertmaxrees> the browser cannot arbitrarily read directories.
[14:05:37] <weijunli> thats why i was mentioning the input tag, at least im able to select the files through it, but my main question is that if im able to do it dynamically with js or so
[14:05:45] <robertmaxrees> you cannot.
[14:06:05] <robertmaxrees> since the browser cannot arbitrarily read directories.  that would be very dangerous if they could.
[14:07:28] <robertmaxrees> that would be a very trivial thing to do with node.js though.
[14:07:39] <robertmaxrees> or any other server-side language.
[15:22:52] <naftilos76> Hi, assuming that i have a select tag and the options are like this: <option value="email">Email address</option> How do i get the "email" string instead of the "Email address" ?
[15:23:40] <naftilos76> I can get the big string with $("#el_id").val() but what about the option value?
[15:27:50] <naftilos76> Anyone?
[15:32:34] <naftilos76> Got it - $("#el_id option[value]").val()
[15:43:24] <naftilos76> Nop still trying...
[15:44:14] <naftilos76> i want to get the string of the option value rather than the string between the >string<

[15:45:47] <taplar> ^ naftilos76
[15:51:08] <naftilos76> thanks
[15:52:10] <naftilos76> This is my tag element but i cannot replicate your code. It works for 'multiple' but not for 'single'. <select id="line_options_for_element_article_id_30" class="window_combo_control" name="line_options_for_element_article_id_30" data-related_html_id="article_id_30"><option selected="single">Single line text</option><option value="multiple">Multi line text</option></select>
[15:52:15] <naftilos76> taplar
[15:52:56] <naftilos76> Do you see anything wrong with the tag element?
[15:53:28] <taplar> first thought is the single is the default value, and the logic is on the change event.  so it wouldn't log the value of the single until you switched from it, and back to it
[15:54:15] <taplar> also your single doesn't have a value
[15:54:22] <taplar> selected="singe"
[15:54:56] <naftilos76> ok so i am not assembling correctly the html tag right?
[15:55:12] <taplar> https://jsfiddle.net/c4r2kzn6/
[16:00:02] <naftilos76> taplar: thanks a lot. i messed up the syntax - it work now - thanks for your time
[16:00:08] <naftilos76> works
[17:03:32] <MikeD_> mydl.find('dd').not('.eq').find('.vl').text()  <-- does that look like a correct way to get the object with class "vl" from the dd tags that are not classed with "eq" from mydl object?
[17:04:34] <taplar> [whateverdlis] dd:not(.eq) .vl <= is what that selector logic is doing
[17:05:17] <MikeD_> dl = definition list
[17:05:25] <MikeD_> do you think i should write it that way to begin with?
[17:05:55] <taplar> mydl.find('dd:not(.eq) .vl').text() could be used
[17:06:55] <MikeD_> i wasn't sure that not() was ok to use that way, so thank you for that.
[19:47:58] <RandomSerb> can anyone please tell me why my formdata isn't getting input values? https://jsfiddle.net/2ao3t8kf/2/
[20:25:14] <shoky_> RandomSerb: because you're passing it a jquery object instead of the actual <form>.  new FormData( loginform[0] )  should work
[20:25:32] <shoky_> RandomSerb: but also, your <input>s don't have any `name` set
[23:38:58] <RandomSerb> is it possible to prevent page from loading until I get response from ajax call? I'm actually checking if user is logged in, so I want to redirect it if not
[23:39:17] <RandomSerb> it needs to be pure html/js, can't use any programming languages.
